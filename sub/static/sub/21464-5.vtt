WEBVTT

00:17.101 --> 00:18.643
What are we gonna do, David?

00:18.644 --> 00:20.437
Uh, are you already
assuming he's guilty?

00:20.438 --> 00:22.480
'Cause, I mean, really, when you
look at the evidence here --

00:22.481 --> 00:23.815
Uh, no.
I-I-I'm not-- I'm not.

00:23.816 --> 00:25.108
- I feel like you--
- I'm not.

00:25.109 --> 00:26.736
I'm not assuming he's guilty.

00:26.944 --> 00:30.280
All I'm saying is that I see a connection

00:30.281 --> 00:34.117
between that letter of Ted's
and the Unabomber manifesto.

00:34.118 --> 00:35.827
Well, when I look at it,
I don't see the connection.

00:35.828 --> 00:39.372
I don't see this. I--
Maybe you're--

00:39.373 --> 00:41.624
Have you considered your own
personal feelings for Ted

00:41.625 --> 00:43.084
might be getting in the way

00:43.085 --> 00:45.879
of making an objective
determination here?

00:45.880 --> 00:48.298
- You're asking <i>me</i> that?
- Well, you don't know Ted.

00:48.299 --> 00:51.301
I mean, you've never met him.
You've never even spoken to him.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.970
Yes, he sent you a nasty letter.
Yes, he's different.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.140
But every family has its oddball.

00:57.475 --> 00:59.434
I <i>know</i> Ted.

00:59.435 --> 01:02.270
H-He was always good.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.397
He was my hero.

01:03.773 --> 01:07.484
Well, if you're right
and he's innocent, then...

01:07.485 --> 01:09.069
he's got nothing to worry about.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.820
Well, that's not true. The...

01:10.821 --> 01:13.198
Ted lives a very
unconventional lifestyle.

01:13.199 --> 01:15.825
He is paranoid.
He has that hunting rifle.

01:15.826 --> 01:20.080
I mean, those people on Ruby Ridge,
they were innocent, too.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.749
And an FBI sniper
shot them in the back.

01:22.750 --> 01:26.337
If we accuse him and we are wrong...

01:30.466 --> 01:33.134
it'd be like...

01:33.135 --> 01:34.594
taking my own brother's life,

01:34.595 --> 01:36.972
and I c-- I can't.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.307
I can't live with that.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.976
But, David...

01:42.061 --> 01:43.646
what if we're right?

02:36.157 --> 02:40.076
Okay.
Y-You came to me why exactly?

02:40.077 --> 02:41.828
I mean, you could just mail it in.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.746
I'll give you the address
for the Task Force.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.790
- W-Well...
- Yeah, I mean, I-I deal

02:45.791 --> 02:47.250
with law enforcement all day long

02:47.251 --> 02:48.710
at the shelter where I work,
and, you know,

02:48.711 --> 02:50.712
once these poor kids
get into the system,

02:50.713 --> 02:53.047
it's impossible to extricate them again.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.425
As soon as you get on the
criminal justice system's radar,

02:55.426 --> 02:58.094
you become a target, especially if you
live an unconventional life.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.931
All right.
Here's what we'll do.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.893
I will channel this directly
to the UNABOM Task Force.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.853
It'll come from my office,
but you and your brother

03:06.854 --> 03:08.480
will remain completely anonymous.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.316
I'll make it clear that
this is not for distribution,

03:11.317 --> 03:13.109
even internally within the UTF.

03:13.110 --> 03:16.446
Tight chain of custody.
Need only.

03:16.447 --> 03:20.992
Now, they'll do a complete analysis
and get us an opinion.

03:20.993 --> 03:24.288
And if it's not a match,
we can all sleep easy.

03:27.499 --> 03:28.750
I think--
Yeah.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.627
All right. I--

03:30.628 --> 03:33.464
To be clear, our priority is, is...

03:35.132 --> 03:36.216
Ted's safety.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.759
I mean, he--

03:37.760 --> 03:40.971
Even if he is the Unabomber,
he's a human being.

03:41.639 --> 03:43.181
He has a soul.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.642
And--and we need to...

03:45.434 --> 03:47.061
We need to protect him.

03:50.231 --> 03:53.608
<i>Dear David, the only thing
I've really respected in you</i>

03:53.609 --> 03:55.152
<i>has been your life in the desert.</i>

03:55.694 --> 03:57.320
<i>And now you're going to leave all that</i>

03:57.321 --> 04:00.281
<i>just because this female
has decided to permit you</i>

04:00.282 --> 04:02.700
<i>to become her personal property.</i>

04:02.701 --> 04:06.412
<i>I presume you will now be adopting
a conventional middle-class lifestyle,</i>

04:06.413 --> 04:08.289
<i>become an accountant maybe.</i>

04:08.290 --> 04:12.377
<i>Or why not sell out all the way
and become a lawyer?</i>

04:12.378 --> 04:15.673
<i>The reason you get me so upset
is that I do care about you, David.</i>

04:16.465 --> 04:19.926
<i>You're still my little brother
and you still have my loyalty.</i>

04:28.435 --> 04:30.436
- Hello?
<i>- David, Tony Bisceglie.</i>

04:30.437 --> 04:32.772
<i>I just got word
from my guy in the UTF.</i>

04:32.773 --> 04:34.274
<i>They analyzed the letter,</i>

04:34.275 --> 04:36.026
<i>and they're not moving
forward with the lead.</i>

04:36.235 --> 04:37.735
<i>It's the wrong typewriter.</i>

04:37.736 --> 04:39.320
So it's not him?

04:39.321 --> 04:41.698
<i>It's not him.
Your brother's been cleared.</i>

04:41.699 --> 04:42.824
Thank you.

04:42.825 --> 04:44.617
It's not him! It's not Ted!

04:44.618 --> 04:46.954
Ted Kaczynski is not the Unabomber!

04:47.288 --> 04:50.124
Oh, God. Oh.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.151
Three months you've been back here.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.530
Three months...

05:22.531 --> 05:24.490
of sleepwalking.

05:24.491 --> 05:28.119
Half an eye on that manifesto there,
the other half on the fax machine.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.914
You're like a teenage girl
waiting for her ex to call.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.583
He dumped you.

05:33.584 --> 05:34.835
Move on.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.215
Fitz...

05:41.675 --> 05:46.304
you are capable of great things here,
but not until you let Unabom go.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.681
I've been where you are right now.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.308
I know.

05:50.309 --> 05:53.102
I know that it seems like more
than a case right now.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.396
But it's just a case.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.191
And I say, from experience,

05:57.524 --> 05:59.193
let it go.

06:00.611 --> 06:01.904
Yeah.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.535
There's nothing.
There's nothing by him.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.245
This is all you got?

06:11.246 --> 06:13.247
<i>I weeded out,
like, the grocery lists and stuff.</i>

06:13.248 --> 06:15.124
Well, this is garbage.
It's not here.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.503
<i>There's a million-dollar reward.
You realize how much crap we get in?</i>

06:58.335 --> 07:00.002
<i>Oh, I see.
You're all gonna gang up on me.</i>

07:00.003 --> 07:01.712
<i>You know
that's not what this is about.</i>

07:01.713 --> 07:03.631
<i>You have three parents now.</i>

07:03.632 --> 07:05.633
<i>And we want to make sure we're
all saying the same thing.</i>

07:07.469 --> 07:10.680
<i>...to unpack.</i>

07:12.683 --> 07:15.601
<i>My dream is for you to...</i>

07:17.354 --> 07:20.107
<i>It's still okay if you
want to come live with me.</i>

07:24.736 --> 07:27.239
- Hey, Negro.
- What up, bruh?

07:28.198 --> 07:30.616
Yo, look. A long-ass letter
come across your desk?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.577
Evidence slip says it's not a match.

07:32.578 --> 07:35.622
I'm about to bag it up and send it
back to the lawyer. Why?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.963
It's the wrong typewriter.
It's not from the Unabomber.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.404
Hey. Ernie?

08:09.948 --> 08:11.282
Can you put your headphones on

08:11.283 --> 08:12.950
and look the other way
for like 10 minutes?

08:12.951 --> 08:15.411
That's "Do Not Distribute."
It can't leave this room.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.538
If the boss catches you with that
or finds out I let you...

08:17.539 --> 08:21.752
Look. It's on me.
You looked away. Please.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.671
This goes into the safe at 3:00.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.340
Thank you.

08:38.310 --> 08:41.062
<i>- I'll get my daughter!
- Do not try any kind of rescue.</i>

08:41.063 --> 08:42.022
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

08:42.397 --> 08:43.940
<i>You would jeopardize the lives
of the Vice President</i>

08:43.941 --> 08:45.274
<i>and everyone else in the arena.</i>

08:45.275 --> 08:46.817
<i>Believe me. We know
what the hell we're doing.</i>

08:48.111 --> 08:49.655
<i>Our agents are entering the arena.</i>

08:49.947 --> 08:51.364
<i>- You stay where you are.</i>
- Excuse me.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.866
<i>We are gonna do this
by the numbers.</i>

08:59.039 --> 09:01.582
- Where have you been?
- It's later here. I'm at the movies.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.876
<i>There's a 23-page letter
going through right now.</i>

09:03.877 --> 09:05.002
It's "Do Not Distribute."

09:05.003 --> 09:06.964
It was sitting in the fax machine tray
at the B.A.U.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.590
Shit, dude, if I get caught...

09:08.924 --> 09:10.342
All right.
I'm going there now.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.098
Hey. Just gonna run to work.
I'll be back before it's over.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.391
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.976
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.520
- Keep an eye on him.
- Okay.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.583
"Human beings will
become dependent...on technology..."

09:43.750 --> 09:47.211
"...beginning of this already...
inability of people to avoid boredom..."

09:50.507 --> 09:53.635
"Let us first consider the solution...

09:54.678 --> 09:57.138
"sketched by Perry London
in his book <i>Behavior Control.</i>

09:57.139 --> 09:59.808
This solution makes
a convenient example."

10:00.892 --> 10:03.853
"...disseminate it among
the population at large.

10:03.854 --> 10:06.355
People can then
use this technology..."

10:06.356 --> 10:08.441
"...disseminate it among
the population at large.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.901
People can then..."

10:11.278 --> 10:14.280
"Continued scientific progress
will inevitably result

10:14.281 --> 10:16.616
in the extinction of individual liberty."

10:16.617 --> 10:20.244
"Technology,"
"freedom," "control."

10:20.245 --> 10:21.455
It's him.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.205
Are you sure? I-I wouldn't--

10:23.206 --> 10:25.833
<i>It's him.
It's an outline of the manifesto.</i>

10:25.834 --> 10:29.462
It's the same ideas in the same order
and the way he writes, his idiolect.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.589
It is identical!
It's identical!

10:31.590 --> 10:33.424
S-So, what's his name?
What's the name?!

10:33.425 --> 10:34.342
<i>I don't know.</i>

10:34.343 --> 10:36.470
Some D.C. lawyer--anonymous.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.180
Look, it's DND.
You've gotta shred your copy.

10:39.181 --> 10:40.474
- What lawyer?!
<i>- I don't know!</i>

10:41.266 --> 10:43.601
Okay? Just please let me go
through the proper cha--

10:43.602 --> 10:46.729
Just find out! I don't care how!
'Cause this is him!

10:46.730 --> 10:48.022
This is him!
This is the man!

10:48.023 --> 10:50.317
And the man that wrote this letter,
he is the Unabomber!

10:50.525 --> 10:51.901
You hear me?!

10:51.902 --> 10:53.070
<i>Fitz? You there?</i>

10:54.154 --> 10:55.238
- What's happening?
<i>- Fitz?</i>

11:00.535 --> 11:02.495
Why the hell would you abandon
your children?

11:02.496 --> 11:04.246
I was only gone one minute.
I was coming right back.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.123
What--
How long have I been?

11:05.916 --> 11:07.834
It's been 4 hours.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.295
Danny's in the car crying.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.013
Are you coming?

11:40.117 --> 11:41.909
You're seriously trying to argue

11:41.910 --> 11:44.705
that the famously anti-technology
Unabomber

11:45.205 --> 11:48.958
has two similar
but not identical typewriters?

11:48.959 --> 11:50.334
Look. I know what forensics said,

11:50.335 --> 11:53.629
but the language of that letter
is really similar to the manifesto.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.298
The ideas are laid out
in a similar way, and I really--

11:56.299 --> 11:58.217
Yeah, I read it.
Uh, I didn't see it.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.386
You know something concrete
that I missed?

12:00.387 --> 12:02.304
Yeah, you got an "analyze" with an "S"

12:02.305 --> 12:05.474
or a "willfully" with one "L",
one of your other special spellings?

12:05.475 --> 12:06.392
It's a steel trap.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.853
Well, no.
Not exactly.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.521
It's just the overall--
Look, I just think

12:10.522 --> 12:13.607
that this is a strong lead
that we should go down the road with!

12:13.608 --> 12:15.735
Track down the writer,
do some interviews.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.737
I don't think you understand
the backstory.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.280
It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.

12:19.281 --> 12:23.242
And it's a letter that forensics has said
conclusively is not a match.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.329
It's a hornets' nest, Tabby.
Why you kicking it?

12:33.754 --> 12:35.045
Hey, yeah.
It's Francine in accounting.

12:35.046 --> 12:38.215
I got an incomplete billing record here.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.759
Uh, one of Anthony Bisceglie's cases.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.635
Hey, are you coming with us tonight?

12:41.636 --> 12:44.305
<i>While You Were Sleeping.</i>
Opening night. You should come.

12:44.306 --> 12:47.975
Uh, record number 31040.
I need an address.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.896
I mean, Peter Gallagher, right?

12:56.359 --> 12:58.528
Thanks, hon! See ya later.

13:00.572 --> 13:05.285
Bad move, Tabby. Bad, bad move.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.080
<i>- Tabby.</i>
- Fitz.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.333
How sure are you about this letter?
Because, uh...

13:12.334 --> 13:14.002
<i>I am completely certain, Tabby.</i>

13:15.170 --> 13:17.213
Anything and everything
you get out of this

13:17.214 --> 13:18.547
has to go through me.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.257
You do not talk to anyone at the UTF

13:20.258 --> 13:22.051
without coming to me first
and making a plan.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.137
I swear I will not even breathe
without going through you.

13:24.596 --> 13:25.597
All right?

13:27.474 --> 13:30.519
Okay. Got a pen?

13:30.727 --> 13:35.022
<i>Perry Avenue,
Schenectady, New York, 12301.</i>

13:35.023 --> 13:36.358
Thank you.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.006
I could have got these.
You know that.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.383
You didn't have to.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.844
I don't really want you...

14:04.845 --> 14:06.805
you know, inside here.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.519
When I finish this case,

14:13.520 --> 14:16.898
and when I get this guy--
and I'm gonna get this guy--

14:20.360 --> 14:23.154
we should put it all back together,
just start over.

14:27.325 --> 14:30.161
You don't even realize
you were wrong, do you?

14:32.163 --> 14:34.791
What you did to those boys...

14:39.087 --> 14:40.839
You know what, Jim?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.506
Boys and I--
we're gonna be okay.

14:42.507 --> 14:43.757
We're gonna be fine.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.760
Everything's gonna work out for us.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.763
But unless you stop now, I don't--

14:49.764 --> 14:53.852
I don't know how all this ends for you.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.522
I really don't.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.651
I-It's not the case.
It's you.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.850
<i>Fog in the early morning,</i>

15:34.017 --> 15:36.810
<i>otherwise partly cloudy skies
in the Albany area</i>

15:36.811 --> 15:41.023
<i>with highs around 65
and lows dipping into the 50s.</i>

15:41.024 --> 15:42.942
<i>...overnight at a gas station
in Schenectady.</i>

15:42.943 --> 15:44.778
<i>Police at the scene...</i>

15:59.376 --> 16:01.835
Hi. I'm Supervisory Special Agent
James Fitzgerald.

16:01.836 --> 16:02.963
I'd just like a word.
May I come in?

16:04.089 --> 16:07.049
Um, wh-- I-I'm sorry.
What is this about? Uh...

16:07.050 --> 16:08.592
It's about the letter.
Can I come in?

16:08.593 --> 16:10.636
I'm sorry. I don't know how
you got my name or my address,

16:10.637 --> 16:12.221
but I'd appreciate it if you get off
my property right now.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.974
I'm so sorry to tell you this,
but I read the letter you submitted,

16:14.975 --> 16:18.186
and the man who wrote that letter
is the Unabomber.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.147
You--

16:22.190 --> 16:25.150
Is th--
Is this a joke?

16:25.151 --> 16:26.194
I mean, w-who--

16:26.820 --> 16:28.654
Who the hell are you?
What are y--

16:28.655 --> 16:29.781
I'm the profiler.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.949
I was assigned the investigation.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.075
- You're the profiler?
- I can explain everything

16:33.076 --> 16:35.119
- if you just let me in.
- Well, well, your boss

16:35.120 --> 16:37.746
just called my attorney
to communicate

16:37.747 --> 16:40.290
that the FBI had ruled out
my brother as a suspect,

16:40.291 --> 16:41.417
so I don't know
what you're doing here--

16:41.418 --> 16:43.711
Your brother? He's your brother?
'Cause he's your brother--

16:43.712 --> 16:45.462
Get off my property!

16:45.463 --> 16:48.091
I came forward, I did what was right,
and he was cleared!

16:50.010 --> 16:52.595
David?
David, he's your brother?

17:04.315 --> 17:07.026
The FBI have gotten
thousands of letters sent in!

17:07.027 --> 17:09.236
Mothers turning in sons,
wives turning in husbands,

17:09.237 --> 17:11.948
brothers across the country
turning in brothers, just like you.

17:12.574 --> 17:13.657
Now, I know you thought it
was all over

17:13.658 --> 17:14.950
and me being here
is your worst nightmare,

17:14.951 --> 17:17.161
but I read every piece of writing
that came in.

17:17.162 --> 17:19.998
I read thousands of possible leads.
I only knocked on one door!

17:20.415 --> 17:22.042
Stop harassing me,
or I'll call the police!

17:28.381 --> 17:30.091
One door. Your door!

17:42.937 --> 17:44.521
If you're an FBI profiler,

17:44.522 --> 17:46.648
you know they're looking
for an airline mechanic

17:46.649 --> 17:48.984
who is around 45 years old
and he is uneducated.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.652
He does not fit that profile at all.

17:50.653 --> 17:51.653
That's not the profile.

17:51.654 --> 17:54.031
Well, then why are your bosses
on "Charlie Rose"

17:54.032 --> 17:55.575
- saying, "This is the profile"?
- It's--It's wrong.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.286
It's-- Oh, the FBI profile's wrong
and they stand behind it?

17:58.495 --> 17:59.495
And--and your boss,

17:59.496 --> 18:01.955
he--he rules out my brother's letter,
but he's wrong, too.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.416
Everybody's wrong, except for you.

18:04.167 --> 18:05.251
Yeah.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.754
You know, I--
I counsel at-risk kids, okay?

18:08.755 --> 18:10.589
And the first thing I tell them:

18:10.590 --> 18:12.591
If everybody in the world seems crazy
except for you

18:12.592 --> 18:14.135
and you're the only sane one, right?

18:14.677 --> 18:17.430
It's time to take a hard look
in the mirror.

18:17.639 --> 18:20.557
You knocked on the wrong door.
And I am done.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.560
You need to leave me alone, please!

18:22.936 --> 18:24.646
I'm-- Please!

18:25.230 --> 18:26.314
And get out.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.774
Why don't you listen to my profile?

18:28.775 --> 18:29.775
I-- Come on, man!

18:29.776 --> 18:31.319
Why don't you listen
to the real profile?

18:31.820 --> 18:33.320
And if it isn't a match for your brother,

18:33.321 --> 18:35.072
you can drive out of here
in good conscience

18:35.073 --> 18:36.825
and you never have to see me again.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.871
He's 50 to 55 years old.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.207
He was raised near Chicago.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.543
Read the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> as a boy.

18:46.918 --> 18:49.587
Got his PhD between '67 and '72.

18:50.672 --> 18:53.258
Sometime after that,
he just got cut off from the world.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.551
There's no TV, no pop culture,

18:55.552 --> 18:57.679
no close friends, no romantic relations.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.222
Nothing. Just isolated.

18:59.931 --> 19:02.016
He's smart, patient,

19:02.767 --> 19:03.935
extremely precise.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.021
And he's angry.

19:07.772 --> 19:10.692
He's just thin-skinned,
takes offense easily,

19:11.151 --> 19:13.235
and he lashes out
at those that he loves

19:13.236 --> 19:14.988
'cause he's got no one else
in his life.

19:15.572 --> 19:18.490
He feels underappreciated,
victimized.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.451
He's sidelined
by his lesser-talented peers.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.412
He's lonely.
He longs for human connection,

19:23.413 --> 19:24.538
but he can't find it.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.499
And it is tearing him apart.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.835
So you talked to Linda?
She--She--

19:29.836 --> 19:31.295
You've been talking to her
about my brother?

19:31.296 --> 19:33.463
Is that--
She contacted you.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.340
I don't know who she is.
I don't know who you are.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.552
I don't know your brother.
I don't know anyone in your life.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.348
I <i>do</i> know the Unabomber.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.563
I know him like I know myself.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.698
Uh...

19:59.699 --> 20:01.075
Um...

20:03.578 --> 20:04.996
Um...

20:09.834 --> 20:10.919
Ted.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.381
His name is Ted.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.771
Okay. This is Ted.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.397
That's the Unabomber.

20:31.689 --> 20:34.524
I don't see any resemblance.
I mean, not at all.

20:34.525 --> 20:37.110
And I've looked at the sketch
for--for hours.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.154
It's not the Unabomber.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.073
What--What do you--
it's an eyewitness sketch.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.116
- The woman at RenTech, she--
- Yeah, the woman at RenTech,

20:43.117 --> 20:45.620
the only person to ever have seen
the Unabomber.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.540
See, the day after
the RenTech bombing,

20:50.541 --> 20:53.126
she described the Unabomber
to a local sketch artist.

20:53.127 --> 20:54.920
The sketch was published
and was so close

20:54.921 --> 20:57.423
that the Unabomber
went into hiding for six years.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.550
But that isn't the sketch.

21:00.551 --> 21:03.887
In 1994, 10 years
after the RenTech bombing,

21:03.888 --> 21:06.348
the head of the Task Force
decides he wants a new sketch,

21:06.349 --> 21:09.559
so he sends a new sketch artist
to the eyewitness, and this time,

21:09.560 --> 21:13.689
what the eyewitness describes
is that sketch.

21:13.690 --> 21:14.856
And it is iconic.

21:14.857 --> 21:17.318
It is the most famous
police sketch in history.

21:17.568 --> 21:18.945
But it's not the Unabomber.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.572
See, the second time around,
the eyewitness was describing

21:22.573 --> 21:25.159
the original sketch artist--
this guy.

21:26.160 --> 21:30.414
Some crazy thing
in the human memory.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.543
She was remembering
"remembering the Unabomber."

21:33.710 --> 21:35.877
And she had spent--
yeah, think about it--

21:35.878 --> 21:37.921
three seconds looking
at the Unabomber.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.257
But she spent the whole
afternoon with him,

21:40.258 --> 21:41.134
the sketch artist.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.095
And over time,
the faces blend together.

21:44.512 --> 21:47.181
What about the original sketch?
What does that look like?

21:59.360 --> 22:00.570
Oh, my God.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.785
Is this where he lives?

22:09.245 --> 22:11.288
David, is this where he lives?

22:11.289 --> 22:12.248
Oh, uh...

22:13.541 --> 22:15.293
That's the cabin we built together.

22:17.879 --> 22:19.588
He's a mathematician.

22:19.589 --> 22:23.384
He designed the cabin
to a perfect mathematical ratio,

22:23.843 --> 22:26.928
but there's no electricity
or running water.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.140
It's, uh --
It's perfect simplicity.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.683
It's western Montana.
It's the middle of nowhere.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.686
It's really beautiful.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.982
He just lives off the land.
He forages, hunts for food.

22:38.483 --> 22:39.942
Has a little garden.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.487
I think he lives off
something like $400 a year.

22:43.112 --> 22:45.530
- He's got no job?
- He does odd jobs here and there,

22:45.531 --> 22:48.492
but he lives about
as far outside the system

22:48.493 --> 22:51.829
as--as anybody can
this day and age.

22:52.121 --> 22:54.664
You know, a lot of people,

22:54.665 --> 22:56.376
even my wife, they--

22:57.543 --> 23:01.047
They look at that
and they think he's...

23:01.381 --> 23:02.632
He's crazy.

23:03.174 --> 23:05.927
He just has the courage to live
according to his ideals.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.263
I respect that.

23:10.348 --> 23:11.724
Yeah, I do, too.

23:13.976 --> 23:17.230
But it was a bit of a push/pull situation,

23:17.939 --> 23:19.439
Ted going to live out in the woods.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.526
He was pulled out there
by his ideals,

23:22.527 --> 23:25.821
but, um, there was--
there was a push, too,

23:25.822 --> 23:28.616
not long after this photo was taken.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.577
So what was the push?

23:34.580 --> 23:37.082
He eventually ran out of money
living out there,

23:37.083 --> 23:40.752
and he came back to Chicago
to get a job.

23:40.753 --> 23:45.466
I got him work at this phone factory
that my, uh, father worked at, and--

23:45.716 --> 23:47.218
I was a foreman there that summer.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.594
Anyhow, there was a girl there
he had a crush on.

23:49.595 --> 23:50.638
Her name was Ellen.

23:51.973 --> 23:53.724
He asked her out.
They went on a few dates.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.559
I think they went apple-picking,

23:55.560 --> 23:58.478
<i>baked a pie in my mother's oven,</i>

23:58.479 --> 24:00.730
<i>but Ted is not great with people,</i>

24:00.731 --> 24:02.984
<i>so she told him she didn't
want to see him again.</i>

24:04.569 --> 24:06.571
<i>I think she was cordial about it, but...</i>

24:07.113 --> 24:10.282
<i>when I showed up to work the next day,
there were, um...</i>

24:10.283 --> 24:13.410
"Certain young lady named Ellen
whose fanny is very repellin'."

24:13.411 --> 24:16.622
<i>The place was covered in these--
these dirty limericks.</i>

24:17.623 --> 24:18.708
<i>They were all about Ellen.</i>

24:19.959 --> 24:22.378
<i>Must've been 150 of them.
They were everywhere.</i>

24:23.337 --> 24:25.422
<i>I mean, anonymous message
is his weapon.</i>

24:25.423 --> 24:27.757
<i>It's the Unabom in miniature,
right down to the typewriter.</i>

24:27.758 --> 24:28.259
Ted?!

24:29.218 --> 24:32.638
I fired my brother, uh...

24:32.930 --> 24:35.849
and that's really
when he made his break.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.269
He took his last paycheck,
and he went out to the cabin for good.

24:40.104 --> 24:41.480
- Do you still see your brother?
- No.

24:41.481 --> 24:42.689
- You still contact him?
- No.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.609
- Call him, visit?
- He doesn't have a phone. We...

24:45.359 --> 24:47.235
We used to write until a few years ago.

24:47.236 --> 24:48.945
I mean, he sent me so many letters.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.781
He would send me another one
before I could even respond.

24:51.782 --> 24:54.076
I probably have a hundred of them.
Hundreds.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.041
I'm gonna have to see those letters.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.002
I'm gonna have to see every letter
that you have.

25:04.378 --> 25:07.131
Some are them are, uh,
at my <i>abri</i> in Texas.

25:08.090 --> 25:10.384
It's a small cabin
I used to live in out there.

25:12.386 --> 25:14.429
The rest are--
are at my mother's.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.349
She's nearby,
so we could go get those.

25:16.599 --> 25:17.517
We can go get 'em.

25:19.227 --> 25:21.270
We'd have to tell my mother that...

25:22.104 --> 25:25.733
her son, uh, is...

25:26.567 --> 25:29.110
And I'm the one that--

25:29.111 --> 25:30.404
that I'm the one that turned him in.

25:31.531 --> 25:34.366
You know, you said there were
other mothers and brothers

25:34.367 --> 25:36.494
who came forward, but, um...

25:37.828 --> 25:38.871
It's <i>my</i> brother.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.667
My brother's the Unabomber.

25:46.087 --> 25:48.339
Do you know what would happen
if it was someone else?

25:50.299 --> 25:52.510
99% of them would just let it go.

25:53.511 --> 25:55.053
They would have lacked the courage.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.222
They would have lacked
the awareness to make that call.

25:57.223 --> 26:01.060
They would have let fear get in the way
of doing what was right.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.937
And we would never, ever
know who he was,

26:03.938 --> 26:06.274
and we would never be able
to stop him.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.110
The world is lucky that it was you.

26:10.570 --> 26:14.031
And you have to take
that burden of guilt

26:14.740 --> 26:16.200
and suffering

26:17.743 --> 26:19.953
so that the rest of us
can sleep safely at night,

26:19.954 --> 26:22.872
and it is the most anyone can give.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.084
Hey!

26:37.096 --> 26:38.180
What's going on?

26:44.353 --> 26:47.815
Yeah, so, if it's him,
then he must be stopped.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.901
Because his victims,
they all had mothers, too.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.533
But he was such a happy boy.

26:57.700 --> 27:00.493
He--He was so gentle with you,
so loving.

27:00.494 --> 27:01.537
Don't you remember?

27:02.455 --> 27:06.167
So where did I go wrong?
What--What happened?

27:09.920 --> 27:11.755
Did something happen to him
at Harvard?

27:11.756 --> 27:12.757
He would never tell me.

27:14.550 --> 27:17.928
But I always felt like something
changed inside him there.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.308
Or maybe when he was a little boy.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.186
Or when?

27:32.610 --> 27:34.195
Is there no answer?

28:08.145 --> 28:09.271
Ted wrote all of these?

28:09.605 --> 28:10.523
Yes.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.199
These go back 30 years.

28:43.347 --> 28:45.850
- The spelling checked out?
- The diction's right on.

28:47.852 --> 28:49.019
It's him.

28:51.063 --> 28:55.150
It's just--
I need to present this to the UTF,

28:55.151 --> 28:56.694
and I need to make them see it, too.

28:59.613 --> 29:02.742
Okay.
We can do this.

29:06.537 --> 29:08.496
We need to go through
Ted's handwritten letters--

29:08.497 --> 29:10.498
his language, his ideas--

29:10.499 --> 29:13.877
and then find points of comparison
in the Unabomber's manifesto.

29:13.878 --> 29:16.880
Yeah, and his life, too.
We work out his history, who he is.

29:16.881 --> 29:19.258
Does it match the timeline?
Does it match the profile?

30:06.263 --> 30:07.306
It's him.

30:08.224 --> 30:11.976
- But do we have it?
- We have him.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.062
We have him.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.324
- Wait.
- Whoa.

30:27.201 --> 30:28.618
What are you doing?

30:28.619 --> 30:30.745
Well, y-you said you left your wife.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.831
- I just thought that--
- Yeah, I did.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.749
But...

30:34.750 --> 30:36.126
Wow.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.259
Sorry.

30:47.096 --> 30:48.055
Thank you.

30:51.392 --> 30:52.518
"Thank you"?

30:55.646 --> 30:57.106
You show up here why?

30:58.482 --> 31:01.610
You leave your wife, you come all the way
across the country to me.

31:01.777 --> 31:02.903
Why?

31:03.195 --> 31:04.613
What are you even doing here?

31:05.030 --> 31:06.407
You here for me
or are you here for him?

31:12.454 --> 31:14.081
Is that what I am to you?

31:16.792 --> 31:19.420
Some accessory
to get you closer to him?

31:27.803 --> 31:30.180
I'm gonna go walk the dogs.
You can let yourself out.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.998
Holy crap.

31:56.707 --> 31:59.042
- Hey. Where's Tabby?
- I don't know.

31:59.043 --> 32:01.378
Where's Tabby?
Tabby!

32:09.929 --> 32:10.888
Hey!

32:11.513 --> 32:15.975
Double-- Hey, hey, hey!
What do you think you're doing?!

32:15.976 --> 32:18.561
You told me to put a name
on the board,

32:18.562 --> 32:20.563
so I'm putting a name on the board.

32:20.564 --> 32:23.358
Told you to put a name
on the board three months ago!

32:23.359 --> 32:24.526
This is him.

32:25.069 --> 32:27.738
This is the Unabomber --
Theodore Kaczynski.

32:28.155 --> 32:29.031
Hold on, Stan.

32:32.159 --> 32:34.036
You got five minutes. Go.

32:38.666 --> 32:40.249
Meet Ted Kaczynski.

32:40.250 --> 32:43.586
He's born in 1942 outside Chicago,
makes him 53.

32:43.587 --> 32:46.005
He's got an IQ of 167.
He's a bona fide genius.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.800
He attended Harvard
on a full scholarship at age 16.

32:48.801 --> 32:52.095
Got a PhD in mathematics
at the University of Michigan in '68,

32:52.096 --> 32:54.723
which correlates with
the formatting of the manifesto.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.184
His dissertation was brilliant.

32:58.102 --> 32:59.687
It won prizes, got published.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.230
Just it was so advanced,
only four or five mathematicians

33:02.231 --> 33:03.690
in the world could understand it.

33:03.691 --> 33:07.151
But this plays into his need
to be listened to

33:07.152 --> 33:10.280
and acknowledged
as a profound genius thinker.

33:12.074 --> 33:14.951
Now, he taught at Berkeley
for two years

33:14.952 --> 33:18.122
before he withdrew into the woods
in Lincoln, Montana.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.666
He built that cabin with his brother.

33:22.334 --> 33:26.088
Ted went back and forth from Chicago,
but he moved there permanently in 1980.

33:26.714 --> 33:29.466
He's living the life that he describes
in the manifesto--

33:30.300 --> 33:32.886
Free from technology,
completely alone.

33:33.095 --> 33:34.929
Yeah, but a lot of people live like that,

33:34.930 --> 33:37.932
and a lot of people have big degrees
and grew up in Chicago.

33:37.933 --> 33:39.601
So he fits your profile.
That's great.

33:39.852 --> 33:41.937
That does not make him
the Unabomber.

33:42.146 --> 33:43.855
You're right.
Except in 1971,

33:43.856 --> 33:45.523
he wrote a document
that could only be described

33:45.524 --> 33:47.151
as a trial run at the manifesto.

33:47.985 --> 33:49.945
It mirrors the manifesto point by point.

33:50.612 --> 33:53.865
It's the same order of ideas.
It's the same preoccupations.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.783
It's the same linguistic idiosyncrasies.

33:55.784 --> 33:56.869
Where'd you get this letter, Fitz?

33:57.119 --> 33:58.579
His brother.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.914
His brother read the manifesto
when we published it,

34:01.915 --> 34:03.541
and he recognized the ideas,

34:03.542 --> 34:05.878
which is why we had it published
in the first place, right?

34:08.130 --> 34:09.923
Plus, look.

34:10.758 --> 34:13.009
He gave me hundreds of letters
to analyze.

34:13.010 --> 34:15.471
There's more coming
from his place in Texas

34:15.679 --> 34:17.139
in the next couple of days.
Look.

34:21.518 --> 34:26.189
I compared his writings to the manifesto,
and I found dozens of similarities.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.774
I also used Kaczynski's letters

34:27.775 --> 34:29.901
to map his movements
for the past 20 years,

34:29.902 --> 34:32.154
and they track closely
with the Unabom events.

34:37.326 --> 34:40.745
He's familiar with Salt Lake City,
Chicago,

34:40.746 --> 34:42.873
and the Bay Area--
the Unabom nexus.

34:43.624 --> 34:45.083
And he feels safe at universities,

34:45.084 --> 34:48.212
which is why he can plant
the bombs there personally.

34:52.216 --> 34:53.342
He fits the profile.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.010
He fits the timeline.

34:55.803 --> 34:56.887
The language is a match.

34:58.639 --> 34:59.681
I got him.

35:01.725 --> 35:03.602
Ted Kaczynski's the Unabomber.

35:13.278 --> 35:16.031
Kaczynski's not Tier 1.
He's not Tier 2.

35:16.406 --> 35:19.368
He's not even in our initial pool
of 15 million.

35:20.828 --> 35:23.664
Computationally,
he's not a suspect.

35:23.831 --> 35:25.706
He's 1,500 miles away.

35:25.707 --> 35:28.835
Every single Unabom letter,
every single Unabom package

35:28.836 --> 35:30.129
came from the Bay Area, right?

35:30.546 --> 35:34.048
So you're telling me he drove three days
every time he wanted to mail something?

35:34.049 --> 35:35.342
He doesn't have a car.

35:37.427 --> 35:38.262
Took a bus.

35:39.930 --> 35:40.806
Took a bus?

35:42.141 --> 35:44.893
It could explain why all his letters
came in batches.

35:45.602 --> 35:46.979
That's always confused me.

35:48.397 --> 35:51.691
He'd send a bunch of letters
and two mail bombs

35:51.692 --> 35:53.192
all together at the same time,

35:53.193 --> 35:56.321
and then he'd disappear for months
until the next burst.

36:00.784 --> 36:04.788
We have to be very,
very careful about this.

36:06.540 --> 36:09.667
Unabomber or not,
this guy's got guns,

36:09.668 --> 36:11.128
knows how to live off the land.

36:11.545 --> 36:14.297
So best case, he's a flight risk.

36:14.298 --> 36:18.468
Worst case, we're talking
Ruby Ridge Montana edition.

36:18.886 --> 36:21.429
Stan, set up a stakeout
in Lincoln, Montana,

36:21.430 --> 36:22.723
and get eyes on the cabin.

36:23.098 --> 36:26.976
Let's see if we can find his bank records,
set up a mail cover.

36:26.977 --> 36:29.145
If he is taking a bus,
there's got to be a record of it.

36:29.146 --> 36:29.980
Yeah, I'm on it.

36:30.230 --> 36:32.774
Fitz, what are your next moves?

36:33.192 --> 36:35.651
Oh, I would love to mine
these letters

36:35.652 --> 36:38.905
for the linguistic evidence to prove
that Ted wrote the manifesto.

36:38.906 --> 36:40.907
Good.
Andy, I want you to sit down

36:40.908 --> 36:43.493
with Steve Freccero.
He's our D.O.J. liaison.

36:43.911 --> 36:46.412
Start figuring out what we need
to feed a federal judge

36:46.413 --> 36:48.081
to get inside of that cabin.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.125
From now on...

36:51.627 --> 36:55.005
Ted Kaczynski
is Unabom suspect number one.

36:59.009 --> 37:01.678
Ted Kaczynski. That's it.

37:24.952 --> 37:25.786
Fitz.

37:30.332 --> 37:32.584
Now, uh, if I remember correctly,

37:33.543 --> 37:37.089
this letter came here
with a "Do Not Distribute" cover.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.925
Now, you were at the B.A.U.
when it did.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.388
Care to shed some light
on that little mystery?

38:11.873 --> 38:12.958
Did you just screw me?

38:15.377 --> 38:18.297
All right. Got some work to do.
Come on, Fitz.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.177
I told you you had to run
everything by me.

38:25.178 --> 38:27.263
- I tried to find you.
- I stuck my neck out for you.

38:27.264 --> 38:29.641
Look, I can fix this.
Tabby, I can fix it.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.436
I looked up to you.

38:33.562 --> 38:34.980
I wanted to <i>be</i> you.

38:37.399 --> 38:40.568
When you came, it was like
someone finally saw me, you know?

38:40.569 --> 38:41.737
Saw my potential.

38:42.696 --> 38:44.447
I wasn't just "Tabby the street agent,"

38:44.448 --> 38:45.990
- who stumbled behind a desk.
- Hey.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.783
You know, I thought
I could do something cool,

38:47.784 --> 38:49.785
be something more.

38:49.786 --> 38:52.497
But you used me
and you screwed me over.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.462
Well, you <i>did</i> break protocol.
You <i>did</i> send the document.

38:59.421 --> 39:00.963
You know,
when you sent the address,

39:00.964 --> 39:02.174
what'd you think was gonna happen?

39:07.429 --> 39:09.931
You're leaving a trail of burnt-out
corpses in your wake, man.

39:10.599 --> 39:11.933
It's gonna catch up with you.

39:12.309 --> 39:13.351
You know, at the end of the road,

39:13.352 --> 39:14.603
you're gonna have nobody
by your side.

39:14.770 --> 39:15.812
Right.

40:01.983 --> 40:03.026
Thank you.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.661
We have to save Ted.

40:13.912 --> 40:14.955
Whatever it takes,

40:15.455 --> 40:20.961
no matter what we have to do or say,
we have to save his life.

41:38.663 --> 41:39.873
There it is.
