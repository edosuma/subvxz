WEBVTT

00:08.800 --> 00:10.552
[person snoring]

00:14.055 --> 00:16.433
[gasps] We fell asleep! We fell asleep!

00:16.516 --> 00:17.767
You were supposed to leave!

00:18.810 --> 00:20.729
[muffled]
I couldn't let you sleep out here alone.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.647
-What?
-Mm.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.776
I couldn't let you sleep out here alone.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.736
Oh.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.864
But seriously, if my mom sees you
she'll explode.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.532
Your mom loves me.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.952
Yeah, but if she knows that
we used our family tent as a marital bed,

00:36.036 --> 00:36.995
she might reconsider.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.915
And if she knew... then she'd tell my mom.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.083
Yeah.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.170
Sterling, I have to go.

00:45.503 --> 00:46.337
-I have to go.
-Yeah.

00:48.715 --> 00:49.799
Don't forget your mouth guard.

00:49.883 --> 00:50.967
Oh.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.177
-And your phone.
-Oh.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.428
And don't forget your hat.

00:53.511 --> 00:54.637
And your guitar.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.223
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.522
[theme music]

01:05.148 --> 01:07.150
[vocalizing]

01:25.293 --> 01:26.961
-Good morning.
-Hi, Sterl.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.756
Oh, I'm sorry, do I know you?
You look like my drunk daughter.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.633
Mom, please let me back inside.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.301
It was one stupid night, okay.

01:33.384 --> 01:34.761
People have stupid nights.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.930
"People" are not
my daughter, Sterling Wesley.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.724
You have my name and you thought nothing
of dragging it through the mud.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.102
Every member of my book club

01:42.185 --> 01:43.603
has called to check on you.

01:43.686 --> 01:46.648
Oh, God, Book Club tomorrow
is gonna be hell, pardon my French.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.733
You have friends that follow
your teenage daughter on Instagram?

01:48.817 --> 01:50.485
I'd be more concerned about that.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.613
But of course, you know best.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.532
-Mom...
-Mm-hm.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.617
You're right,
I should have been more responsible.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.576
I'm really sorry.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.037
An apology
is not going to fix it, Sterling.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.126
Just like you thought an apology
would cut it with your father's truck.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.753
But Blair did that, too!
And we're halfway to paying you back.

02:09.546 --> 02:11.923
Uh, Mom, I've learned my lesson,
please trust me.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.800
Your father and I will determine

02:13.883 --> 02:15.552
when you have truly learned
the error of your ways.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.846
Dad's off hunting.
How's he gonna see that I've learned?

02:17.929 --> 02:19.889
I don't know, dear.
How are you going to convince your mother

02:19.973 --> 02:22.225
and everyone she's ever known
that you did not grow up

02:22.308 --> 02:24.227
on the set of a Spring Break video, hm?

02:25.061 --> 02:26.229
[Sterling sighs]

02:28.606 --> 02:29.482
Mom.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.192
Um...

02:31.943 --> 02:32.902
Did you hear that?

02:37.657 --> 02:39.784
You're so different
from any girl I've dated.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.578
All-- All two of 'em.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.246
How so?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.582
And I'm gonna need those names
and Instagram handles.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.834
Ever since I first saw you
at the Country Club,

02:47.917 --> 02:50.795
you just put out this crazy confidence.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.380
You're super down-to-earth,

02:52.839 --> 02:54.257
just comfortable with who you are.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.968
It's mad sexy.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.094
[chuckles]

02:59.220 --> 03:00.972
You're mad sexy.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.018
[sighs] I miss you.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.229
Living 22 minutes away
is basically like living in another state.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.439
Oh, for real, though!

03:09.522 --> 03:11.232
It's like some Romeo and Juliet type shit.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.483
[chuckles]

03:12.567 --> 03:14.152
Okay, baby, I gotta go to work.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.486
All right, baby. Text me.

03:15.778 --> 03:16.988
Okay, bye.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.072
[cell phone clicks off]

03:29.667 --> 03:31.169
Knock knock, vagrant sister.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.505
Did you bring my deodorant?

03:35.006 --> 03:37.300
Oh, yeah. You were almost out
and I was almost out,

03:37.383 --> 03:38.676
so I smushed the two together.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.220
Powder Fresh meets Spring Breeze.

03:40.803 --> 03:41.763
[cell phone bleeps]

03:43.932 --> 03:45.016
[chuckles]

03:45.099 --> 03:46.726
Is Miles texting you dog memes again?

03:46.809 --> 03:47.685
Yeah.

03:48.728 --> 03:49.854
Life is funny, Sterl.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.981
You know, one day you're a single woman

03:52.065 --> 03:54.359
fueled by the lyrics
of old Tori Amos songs,

03:54.442 --> 03:57.320
and the next, you're a part of someone.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.656
I'm not an island anymore.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.115
I'm a pair of islands.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.076
So, you're an archipelago?

04:03.159 --> 04:05.536
Seriously, dude,
if I may gush for a second...

04:05.870 --> 04:06.871
Miles gets me.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.373
That's what you said about Jennings.

04:08.456 --> 04:10.250
Yeah, but I was
a different person back then,

04:10.333 --> 04:11.876
-young and naive--
-That was two weeks ago.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.795
Miles gets me way more.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.422
I should have known to look
at guys from other schools.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.675
He's almost more of an outsider than I am.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.343
He likes super weird music,

04:20.426 --> 04:22.637
he DJs, he goes to public school.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.931
So, he's an outsider
because he goes to public school?

04:25.014 --> 04:26.224
To me, yes.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.726
Plus, Miles is, like,
the salt of the earth.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.478
Earning the money for his car.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.397
You know, nothing has been handed to him.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.982
His mom works two jobs.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.858
I work two jobs and I live in a tent!

04:35.942 --> 04:37.443
[groans] I can't live like this!

04:37.527 --> 04:38.528
How am I gonna convince Mom

04:38.611 --> 04:40.488
that I'm worthy of living
under the Wesley roof?

04:41.322 --> 04:43.366
Sounds like white people problems.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.368
We're white. And it actually doesn't.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.121
Yeah, but like, compared to
what Miles goes through--

04:48.204 --> 04:49.747
We're not talking about Miles!

04:49.831 --> 04:52.750
Sterling, I'm in a partnership now.

04:53.626 --> 04:54.919
We're always talking about Miles.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.755
Wanna see this dog meme
that Miles sent me?

04:59.632 --> 05:01.009
-[gasps]
-Big boy energy.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.094
-Ooh, look at him, he's so fluffy!
-Who's a good boy?

05:03.177 --> 05:04.721
Johnny Cornwall skipped again.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.472
-Here's his file.
-Absolutely not.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.724
[Blair] What's his deal?

05:08.016 --> 05:08.891
Public masturbator.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.269
Eww. Save that for the bathtub.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.354
Or the car, if traffic's really bad.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.398
Sick! You do that in the car?

05:15.481 --> 05:17.108
Um, my body is a temple.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.860
And the car is a temple on wheels.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.778
So, you're a temple in a moving temple?

05:20.862 --> 05:21.946
Don't shame me.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.575
You're turning down
all my damn skips today.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.160
Are you forgetting I'm your boss?

05:27.243 --> 05:29.120
I'm the head chef.
You're the little waiter dude.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.955
You can't decide what food to dish out.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.041
Yolanda, these skips are bullshit.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.585
I got a feeling you're giving
Terrance the Clown all the good jobs.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.212
I don't care about your feelings.
I care about recouping my money.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.340
-Terrance delivers.
-Oh, please-- [scoffs]

05:40.840 --> 05:41.674
Anything else?

05:41.758 --> 05:42.717
I've got a big one,

05:42.800 --> 05:44.969
but I'm not sure if Eeyore here
is up for the challenge.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.305
And I'm out a shit ton for her.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.806
Kendra Saint John.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.517
Fancy. Sounds like a countess!

05:51.601 --> 05:53.144
Good day, Countess Saint John.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.521
So, this chick's a scammer.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.274
She throws jewelry parties
and claims it's high-end product,

05:58.358 --> 06:00.318
but it's actually just tin
spray painted in gold.

06:00.943 --> 06:04.030
By the time the victims figure it out,
she skips town, changes her name,

06:04.113 --> 06:05.656
does it all over again.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.408
Her focus is niche groups.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.994
Her last venture, "F Everything,"
was targeted at anarchists.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.497
Anarchists buying matching bracelets?
Uh-uh.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.166
The product was a chain that connects
nose ring to belt to nose ring.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.669
But what if you stand up really fast
and then you pull your nose?

06:18.753 --> 06:19.921
[Sterling and Blair groan]

06:20.004 --> 06:21.297
No wonder they're so angry.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.758
Currently, she's running
a Christian-based scam.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.510
The company's called Jewels of the Magi.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.428
Using the Lord like that!

06:27.512 --> 06:28.805
Yeah, that feels rude.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.348
Like, biblically rude.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.558
Okay, any intel on places she frequents?

06:32.642 --> 06:33.893
The local precinct might have some

06:33.976 --> 06:35.895
if you'd get over yourself
and go down there.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.855
You trying to play games with me?

06:37.939 --> 06:39.023
I don't play games.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.942
And if I was playing games, I'd win.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.652
I'm in better shape and I cheat.

06:43.111 --> 06:43.986
Uh...

06:44.070 --> 06:46.781
Stop fighting, Mom and Dad.
I don't wanna work with the cops.

06:46.864 --> 06:49.367
-Okay? Their squeaky pants scare me.
-[Bowser] Well, don't worry.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.536
We don't work with cops. Ever.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.662
Mm.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.205
Company policy.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.792
Wow, I just realized, in this very moment,

06:57.875 --> 06:59.127
that old people are super dramatic.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.045
-Who are you calling old?
-I am not dramatic!

07:02.630 --> 07:04.549
Okay, so, what's the plan here?

07:04.632 --> 07:07.009
Should we tell her that we're throwing
one of her little party thingies

07:07.093 --> 07:08.511
and give her the Yogurtopia address?

07:08.594 --> 07:10.054
-Good idea!
-[Yolanda] Hell, no!

07:10.138 --> 07:12.890
No way she's gonna buy that
some rich white ladies live around here.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.225
You need a home address

07:14.308 --> 07:15.893
in a one percent kind of neighborhood.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.152
[women chattering]

07:25.111 --> 07:27.363
I hope you have more than just
that one little bottle.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.448
[chuckles]

07:28.531 --> 07:30.241
Yes, not to worry, Charlotte.

07:30.324 --> 07:33.035
-We are overflowing with wine.
-Mm.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.871
You know... and crab puffs.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.289
You should eat something.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.249
Lynn! Oh.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.459
How are you?

07:39.834 --> 07:42.253
Great! Your house looks fantastic.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.422
That new wallpaper is to die for.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.299
-I love it!
-Oh, wow! Thank you.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.801
Yeah, it just felt like
time for a refresh.

07:48.885 --> 07:49.719
[both chuckle]

07:50.261 --> 07:52.096
-That stupid book.
-Oh.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.390
I stopped when the neighbor
found the clue in the vacuum.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.185
I couldn't finish it either.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.061
I'm so glad to be here.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.355
Vernon left for his hunting trip today.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.565
Oh.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.734
You know Anderson
is out on the lease, too.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.486
What is it with these boys and their guns?

08:06.569 --> 08:09.030
I don't know, but maybe
with all of them out in the wild,

08:09.113 --> 08:11.073
they'll shoot each other
and save us the misery.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.372
Right, excuse me.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.042
Sterling, honey, what's going on?

08:21.792 --> 08:23.336
I thought you were
refreshing sparkling waters

08:23.419 --> 08:25.546
and Blair was doing the hors d'oeuvres.
Please do not confuse the duties.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.174
I finished refreshing the waters,
so I just grabbed the puffs.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.467
Just taking initiative, Mommy.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.177
And I can help pour wine, too.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.554
Lord, no, them seeing you
cozied up with a bottle?

08:33.638 --> 08:35.181
Honey, that is the last thing we need.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.266
I'll handle the wine. [clears throat]

08:41.812 --> 08:42.647
Mom's happy.

08:42.939 --> 08:43.773
She's happy.

08:44.815 --> 08:45.983
Do you think she's happy?

08:46.067 --> 08:49.487
[groans] Mrs. Burton told her that
the guest towels were beautifully crisp.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.781
-[sighs]
-She'll be high on that till Christmas.

08:51.864 --> 08:52.865
Yeah. Okay.

08:53.824 --> 08:54.825
[cell phone bleeps]

09:02.667 --> 09:03.543
[Miles] Surprise!

09:04.335 --> 09:06.337
[gasps] Babe! What are you doing here?

09:06.879 --> 09:08.130
-Oh.
-[giggles]

09:08.214 --> 09:09.924
You know how we never
get to see each other?

09:10.007 --> 09:11.217
-Mm-hm.
-I'm fixing that.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.718
Oh, I'm so happy!

09:12.969 --> 09:15.388
Seeing you on a Sunday afternoon,
what a luxury!

09:15.680 --> 09:18.516
But... [groans] damn it,
I can't really hang right now.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.184
I'm kinda helping my mom
with her book club.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.978
No, I know. I'm the valet.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.312
You're what now?

09:23.396 --> 09:24.939
I overheard your mom
talking about it at the club,

09:25.022 --> 09:26.399
and I offered my services.

09:26.607 --> 09:29.193
So, now I get to see my girl
and make some bread.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.946
-Wow.
-[chuckles]

09:32.029 --> 09:33.656
Shocking update...

09:34.156 --> 09:35.950
Miles is here.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.743
What do you mean here? Like here, here?

09:37.827 --> 09:39.453
No, like the here that means over there.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.205
-Yes! Here! At our house!
-Why?

09:41.289 --> 09:43.374
Mom hired him as a valet.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.710
What if he wants a tour?

09:46.919 --> 09:47.795
Um...

09:47.878 --> 09:50.715
I need to go stage my room
like I wasn't 12 in the last five years.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.383
I definitely need to hide my BTS poster.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.176
-Are you worried--
-I cannot burn that poster, Sterling,

09:54.260 --> 09:55.678
you know it has
emotional resonance for me.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.054
-No, I mean that--
-Okay, you know what?

09:57.138 --> 09:59.181
Fine, I will burn it,
but I'm furious about this!

09:59.265 --> 10:00.474
No, don't burn anything.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.643
You're right.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.104
[chuckles] What am I doing?

10:05.688 --> 10:07.898
Everything is fine.
It's great to have him here.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.109
Who cares if he knows
that I love J-Hope the most...

10:10.192 --> 10:11.360
with Suga a close second?

10:12.194 --> 10:13.237
He likes me for me.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.657
But, you're fine that he's here
as a valet... the help...

10:16.991 --> 10:18.075
at your mother's hen party?

10:19.452 --> 10:20.411
-Oh, shit.
-Yeah.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.580
This is the first time that he's here
at your house

10:22.663 --> 10:24.290
and you're already on unequal footing.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.584
It's not like Mom knew about us
before she hired him.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.462
I'm still trying to work up the courage
to tell her that we're going out on dates.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.505
Why? Because he's black?

10:31.589 --> 10:32.590
Because he's Catholic.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.425
Oh, right. Well, whatever.

10:34.508 --> 10:37.011
He's here now at your rich,
portrait-addled mansion,

10:37.094 --> 10:38.596
and we're bounty hunting.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.182
He says that he likes me
because I'm down to earth.

10:41.390 --> 10:44.644
This is, like, the least
down to earth thing in the entire world.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.771
-It's basically Pluto.
-You need to fix this.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.523
[scoffs] It's cool. I'm cool.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.192
-[cell phone rings]
-Look at me be--

10:51.275 --> 10:52.109
It's Bowser.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.653
-Hello?
-[Bowser] Girls...

10:53.736 --> 10:56.364
I think I just saw her pull in
but I couldn't positively ID her.

10:56.822 --> 10:57.823
Run out and check.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.577
If it's her, make up an excuse
and get her down the driveway.

11:01.952 --> 11:02.870
I'll do the rest.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.164
Wait, hold up.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.722
Oh, stand down, stand down. It's a dude.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.432
-What do you mean, it--
-[disconnect tone]

11:23.516 --> 11:24.433
Hello?

11:25.059 --> 11:26.310
Don't hang up on me, you--

11:26.936 --> 11:28.938
Welcome to our little gathering!
And you would be?

11:29.021 --> 11:31.273
I'm John Slack with Jewels of the Magi,

11:31.357 --> 11:32.608
and you must be Debbie.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.902
-Uh--
-No! No! No! Uh, she can't vote yet.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.446
Our mom, Debbie, is inside.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.823
So, where's Kendra?

11:39.407 --> 11:41.826
Oh, unfortunately,
she couldn't make it today.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.202
I'm happy to fill in.

11:44.286 --> 11:46.038
I got lots of bling to show,

11:46.122 --> 11:48.541
so I hope you folks are ready to buy!

11:49.083 --> 11:50.084
I think we actually--

11:50.167 --> 11:51.252
Yeah, well, you're, um...

11:51.335 --> 11:53.212
Shit. Shit. Shit.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.760
Oh.

11:59.844 --> 12:00.845
Well, hello there.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.096
Who do we have here?

12:02.471 --> 12:03.305
Surprise!

12:03.389 --> 12:04.432
This is John Slack.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.142
He is a sales associate

12:06.225 --> 12:08.352
with Jewels of the Magi,
a jewelry company.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.271
Pleased to meet you

12:10.354 --> 12:13.065
and show you and your guests some jewelry.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.571
Right... Um, well, that is just fantastic.

12:18.654 --> 12:21.073
Please, make your... self at home.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.034
What the hello is this?

12:24.118 --> 12:25.077
A fun addition to the party?

12:25.453 --> 12:26.829
Each piece in the collection

12:26.912 --> 12:29.582
was inspired by a passage in the Bible.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.834
So, it's designed to adorn the wearer

12:31.917 --> 12:34.086
and exalt the Lord at the same time.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.880
Um... Uh-huh.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.048
You know, thank you, girls, but...
[chuckles]

12:38.132 --> 12:39.884
...they're a little over the top
for my taste.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.219
You don't have to buy any.
In fact, you-- you shouldn't.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.556
Yeah, think of them as, like,
entertainment or like, um...

12:45.639 --> 12:47.600
an upscale conversation starter

12:47.683 --> 12:48.934
-for you and your guests.
-Yes.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.978
That way you don't have to
talk about the book.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.564
It sat on the table
in the same place for a month,

12:53.647 --> 12:55.191
so we know you didn't read it.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.442
Well, I-- I...

12:59.487 --> 13:00.738
[sighs]

13:07.369 --> 13:08.496
Oh-- uh...

13:09.038 --> 13:10.039
Okay.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.875
[breathing fast]

13:14.084 --> 13:15.085
Kendra's not coming.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.545
Aw, goddamn it! What?

13:16.629 --> 13:17.880
Yeah, she sent this guy instead,

13:17.963 --> 13:20.090
like, a minion,
who's inside our house right now,

13:20.174 --> 13:22.384
trying to hock cheap rhinestones
to unsuspecting women.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.220
There's no way they'll bite,
they have expensive taste.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.679
-You're right.
-No, wait. Listen.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.598
Have y'all ever interrogated anyone?

13:28.015 --> 13:30.434
Oh, we're pros at getting information
out of people.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.102
Last year, Margot Carroll said

13:32.186 --> 13:33.854
she had a thing
with someone over the summer,

13:33.938 --> 13:37.274
and it took us five minutes with Hannah B
to find out it was two people.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.401
James Fenser and Terry Massingill.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.487
Wait, I thought that
she only held hands with Terry.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.197
Yeah, but Hannah B screenshotted
her playlist

13:43.280 --> 13:45.032
-that she put on her story--
-That's right...

13:45.115 --> 13:47.493
Okay! Stop! Stop. Stop talking.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.745
How's Sterling doing?

13:50.329 --> 13:52.498
You know, my Hannah saw that post of hers

13:52.581 --> 13:54.083
-and she told me--
-Oh, that old thing.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.336
No-- You know,
Sterling is doing just great.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.630
That was a nothing.
She made Honor Roll again.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.298
Do you know that
that's six semesters in a row?

14:01.382 --> 14:03.092
-[chuckles]
-I'm so glad to hear it.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.970
It's just, if you let one sin in the door,
the next thing you know,

14:06.053 --> 14:07.263
the devil will come a-knockin'.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.266
Not at this house, we have ADT. [chuckles]

14:10.349 --> 14:14.144
Jesus wishes He died
on a cross this beautiful.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.605
I'll take three. My Luke might want
to give one to Sterling.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.607
Their six year anniversary's coming up.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.277
-[chuckles]
-You know what? I'll take one, too.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.070
Oh, and can you throw in a brooch?

14:23.153 --> 14:24.113
Mm-hm.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.574
Oh, Debbie... this bracelet

14:27.074 --> 14:29.785
will look absolutely adorable
with that outfit.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.829
Um, yeah, that-- that is...

14:32.997 --> 14:33.831
precious.

14:34.748 --> 14:35.708
Um...

14:37.418 --> 14:38.377
You know what?

14:38.919 --> 14:40.296
Why not? I'll take it.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.339
Great! That'll be 180 dollars.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.133
Uh, mm-- Okay.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.926
Let me just go get my card reader.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.429
[Sterling] What?

14:49.471 --> 14:52.725
Our mark is isolated in the kitchen.
He isolated himself!

14:52.808 --> 14:53.642
Mark?

14:53.726 --> 14:54.935
No, the-- the guy!

14:55.686 --> 14:57.438
The guy we need to get information from!

14:57.521 --> 14:58.439
Then just say that.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.524
-Hi!
-Hello...

15:00.608 --> 15:04.570
Hey, y'all.
You two seem like great candidates

15:05.070 --> 15:07.072
for this Cain and Abel locket set.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.408
Ooh. Mmm.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.118
Thanks, we don't really do
the matching thing.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.287
Not even headbands?

15:13.370 --> 15:16.290
Actually, we were hoping to
ask you a couple of questions.

15:16.832 --> 15:19.001
We're doing a research paper
on what it's like

15:19.084 --> 15:20.628
to work for women entrepreneurs,

15:21.295 --> 15:23.130
and we would really appreciate your...

15:24.131 --> 15:25.090
expertise.

15:25.966 --> 15:26.967
Ask away.

15:27.051 --> 15:31.305
Do you work out?
Because your shape is so good to my eyes.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.349
What?

15:33.641 --> 15:38.020
My sister is trying to let me ask
the questions here.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.147
Okay, fine.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.066
-Which are...?
-Do you like working for Kendra?

15:42.149 --> 15:43.275
What's Kendra like?

15:43.609 --> 15:46.654
What's Kendra's day-to-day itinerary,
generally speaking?

15:46.737 --> 15:47.738
I wish I knew.

15:47.821 --> 15:51.033
If only I existed in her orbit
on a more regular basis,

15:51.116 --> 15:55.579
but sadly, she is busier than a fruit fly
swimming in ambrosia.

15:56.413 --> 16:01.627
That... must be difficult for you.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.463
Unfair, really.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.507
Yeah, you are so brilliant at sales.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.592
It must be really hard
having Kendra trap you

16:08.676 --> 16:10.094
in such a lower level position.

16:10.177 --> 16:15.265
Oh. No. No.
She is such a wonderful mentor.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.475
So giving.

16:16.558 --> 16:19.103
I'm on the phone with her all day long,

16:19.186 --> 16:20.813
filling orders, strategizing.

16:20.896 --> 16:21.939
We're a team.

16:23.232 --> 16:27.903
You know, sometimes when a person
is really talented,

16:28.445 --> 16:30.948
their boss manipulates them.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.574
When really, they--

16:32.658 --> 16:34.910
Oh, look at that!
Kendra's asking me to call her.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.286
Uh, if you'll excuse me.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.497
Tell her to come by the house
if she's free!

16:38.580 --> 16:40.249
[John] Hello? Kendra?

16:40.332 --> 16:43.168
Yes, that shipment
of bangles just came in

16:43.252 --> 16:44.628
and they are as sparklin'...

16:44.712 --> 16:47.464
Um, can you work on that
while I go take care of Miles?

16:47.548 --> 16:49.466
Make him think that
I'm this super chill lady.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.218
Which I am and not his...

16:51.593 --> 16:54.263
upper crust, white employer.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.391
Sounds like fun.

16:57.808 --> 17:01.478
Hey! If you're tired,
take a load off, have a sandwich.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.772
Or don't. Just have fun!

17:03.897 --> 17:05.107
But that's not an order.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.234
Like, thank you,
but that'd be kind of weird.

17:07.943 --> 17:08.819
I don't see why.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.404
But, whatever you want.

17:10.487 --> 17:13.198
Well, if you saw your valet
eating a big old sandwich, chiefin',

17:13.490 --> 17:14.658
you'd be tight, wouldn't you?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.744
I don't really know
what "chiefin'" means, but...

17:17.619 --> 17:20.080
valet is such a weird word.
Don't you think?

17:20.664 --> 17:23.083
It rhymes with "chalet",
which is also a weird word,

17:23.500 --> 17:25.586
"ballet"...less weird to me, you know?

17:26.587 --> 17:28.505
No. I don't know what you're saying.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.966
I'm just saying that it is all good.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.093
And since I'm here, hey, I got this one.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.011
You relax.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.429
Thank you, Miss Weldon,

17:35.512 --> 17:38.098
I bow before you
and this beautiful vehicle.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.100
-May I take the keys to your castle?
-Babe...

17:40.184 --> 17:41.060
let me do my job.

17:41.894 --> 17:42.853
[cell phone bleeps]

17:43.395 --> 17:44.354
Shit.

17:46.690 --> 17:47.649
[groans quietly]

17:50.944 --> 17:51.779
[sighs]

17:59.328 --> 18:00.537
[groans]

18:00.621 --> 18:02.623
Throw a dick on a cactus.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.462
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

18:08.670 --> 18:11.799
Do you have a reason for being parked this
lengthy a duration in the neighborhood?

18:13.175 --> 18:14.259
What, I couldn't live here?

18:14.885 --> 18:15.761
Do you live here?

18:15.844 --> 18:17.304
That's not my point, but, no.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.139
Sir, please answer the question.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.474
Uh... [clears throat]

18:21.767 --> 18:23.185
I'm kind of undercover here.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.646
I'm... working and--

18:25.729 --> 18:27.898
Wait, wait, wait.
You're an undercover cop?

18:28.649 --> 18:29.900
I'm trying not to blow my cover.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.861
-Oh, man. Of course.
-Yeah. Yeah.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.404
-Great.
-I-- I--

18:34.488 --> 18:36.240
I'll be your backup. I don't mind.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.200
Us brothers in law enforcement,

18:38.575 --> 18:40.035
we need to look out for each other.

18:40.119 --> 18:40.994
Well...

18:41.078 --> 18:42.162
I'll tell you what...

18:42.246 --> 18:43.789
-That car right over there...
-Mm.

18:43.872 --> 18:44.748
...I'll be in it.

18:44.832 --> 18:45.666
Okay.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.711
Yep. I see you. You see it.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.296
Thank you, Barney Fife.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.133
[car door closes]

18:54.216 --> 18:55.259
[chattering]

18:55.342 --> 18:56.969
Excuse me, Mrs. Creswell,

18:57.344 --> 18:59.054
-you dropped this.
-Oh, thank you, hon.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.014
You're always so polite.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.350
I can't help it,
I was taught to respect my elders.

19:03.433 --> 19:06.270
Okay, now, that was disrespectful,
calling me an elder.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.730
-I'm sorry.
-[chuckles] That's okay.

19:10.691 --> 19:11.984
You got a good one, here.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.569
Oh.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.613
Yeah, yeah, I know.

19:16.697 --> 19:17.739
No, I mean it.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.492
So what if she screwed up a little?

19:21.118 --> 19:22.202
I mean, we all do.

19:25.038 --> 19:27.040
[chatter on police radio]

19:29.126 --> 19:30.210
Yep, here we go.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.548
-Sir?
-Yes?

19:34.631 --> 19:35.757
What's your business here?

19:35.841 --> 19:37.342
Hey, fellas, no need to worry.

19:37.426 --> 19:38.635
He is one of us us.

19:39.469 --> 19:40.304
Us?

19:41.138 --> 19:42.055
Law enforcement.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.307
He's a cop!

19:43.765 --> 19:44.766
Is that right?

19:45.726 --> 19:47.186
Yeah, well, show us your badge.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.688
-Uh, well...
-Are you a cop or not?

19:49.771 --> 19:51.899
He straight up told me he was a cop.
See his binoculars?

19:51.982 --> 19:53.984
[chuckles] You said I was a cop.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.235
And you agreed with me.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.278
Mm.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.906
I'm a bail enforcement officer.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.450
-Ah, a bounty hunter.
-Yeah, waiting on a skip.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.118
And my lead is in the area.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.244
Where's your skip?

20:04.328 --> 20:05.996
Wait, your skip or your bounty?

20:06.079 --> 20:07.581
It's the same damn thing, idiot.

20:07.998 --> 20:11.793
Oh, boy.
Your story's really coming unraveled, huh?

20:12.878 --> 20:15.964
I'm gonna need to see the paperwork
you have on your skip, sir.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.677
Well, I'm not legally obligated
to share that information with you.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.848
But, you know what?

20:26.266 --> 20:28.977
I'm feeling super duper nice today.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.528
This was great, Debbie.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.446
Oh, thank you.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.450
Come on, are we not gonna talk about
the elephant in the room?

20:43.533 --> 20:44.368
Charlotte...

20:44.910 --> 20:47.871
What? You can't just put on
the perfect little party

20:48.413 --> 20:50.123
and pretend like nothing's wrong.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.293
Crab puffs and cobbler
don't make us forget.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.379
Wow, Charlotte.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.506
Okay, that's enough.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.093
Listen, Sterling is a wonderful daughter.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.345
She is a loving sister.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.807
She's an excellent student.
I mean, the list goes on and on.

21:07.182 --> 21:09.977
Yes, she drank alcohol... one time,

21:10.060 --> 21:12.062
but is that how you're gonna sum her up?

21:12.145 --> 21:13.647
Really? You of all people,

21:13.730 --> 21:15.816
whose insides could pickle
a farmer's market?

21:18.485 --> 21:20.404
Mm. That's not the elephant
I was talking about.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.198
I was talking about Sterling
having sex with Luke.

21:28.745 --> 21:29.705
My Luke?

21:32.874 --> 21:35.836
Sterling had sex with my sweet Luke?

21:51.018 --> 21:52.227
[clears throat] Ladies...

21:53.812 --> 21:56.023
I know all about Sterling
and we are dealing with it.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.068
It's been a long day.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.405
I think it's time that you
take your cobbler to go.

22:06.783 --> 22:08.160
I would recommend an Uber.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.086
Sterling...

22:20.464 --> 22:22.799
I am so disappointed to hear this.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.010
-Lynn!
-What?

22:25.927 --> 22:27.554
You know it takes two to tango.

22:28.096 --> 22:29.181
I'll call you later.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.607
[door shuts]

22:52.454 --> 22:54.081
Mama, I want to explain.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.208
Sterling, please give me a moment alone.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.677
Looks to me like this dude

23:07.761 --> 23:09.930
is pretending he's on the force
out of nostalgia.

23:11.139 --> 23:12.432
What is that supposed to mean?

23:12.516 --> 23:16.895
You are looking at the man
who shot Officer Atticus.

23:17.938 --> 23:18.855
Down in Florida?

23:20.190 --> 23:22.150
Ho-ly shit.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.152
[security guard] Hey, who's that?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.779
I want to know what we're talking about.

23:30.033 --> 23:30.867
[groans]

23:31.701 --> 23:32.536
Hi!

23:33.078 --> 23:36.456
I would love for you
to bring my car around.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.999
You actually can't leave now,

23:38.083 --> 23:39.793
our valet's on break, so...

23:39.876 --> 23:41.878
-Union rules.
-No, I can do it.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.171
-Sir, if you just--
-No, he can't!

23:43.255 --> 23:44.464
Sorry, just one second.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.551
Couldn't you use a bathroom break?

23:47.968 --> 23:50.595
And they're putting away that spinach dip,
it's to die for!

23:50.679 --> 23:52.305
-Blair, what--
-You've gotta have some before you go.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.475
Please, have some for me. Thank you.
Make me a plate and wait for me.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.393
Thank you.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.814
So, unfortunately,
our valet lost your car.

24:00.897 --> 24:04.651
-Well, it's a pink Cadillac...
-Uh-huh.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.653
...license plate, "blessed",

24:06.820 --> 24:09.865
B-L-three-S-S-three-D.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.784
Yeah, he's colorblind.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.537
And a little bit dyslexic,
but that's between you and me.

24:15.954 --> 24:19.124
I'll just walk around
the neighborhood myself and find it.

24:19.207 --> 24:20.125
Can't be that far.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.878
Oh, I can't let you do that.
I'll drive you to your car.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.671
-[John] Oh, well...
-[Blair] So...

24:25.213 --> 24:28.383
We've been down this street already.
Three times.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.594
-Have we?
-Isn't there some sort of system

24:30.677 --> 24:32.304
for keeping track
of where the cars are parked?

24:32.387 --> 24:35.515
-I really wouldn't know, I'm not a valet.
-[rock music plays]

24:35.599 --> 24:37.851
If someone doesn't find my car soon,

24:38.393 --> 24:40.270
I'm calling the police.

24:40.353 --> 24:41.855
[brakes screech]

24:42.439 --> 24:44.983
-Well, wouldn't that be the tits?
-What the hell are you doing?

24:45.066 --> 24:47.569
I'm a real official bounty hunter!

24:47.652 --> 24:49.488
And I know about the scam
that Kendra's running,

24:49.613 --> 24:51.823
like "F Everything" and "Om Shanti Shiny".

24:51.907 --> 24:53.909
You're covering for a con artist!
Give her up already!

24:53.992 --> 24:55.869
I don't know who you're talking about!

24:55.952 --> 24:59.289
Really? Kendra Saint John,
aka Candy Brunswick,

24:59.372 --> 25:01.917
aka Connie McCready, aka your pimp!

25:02.000 --> 25:02.876
Stop it!

25:02.959 --> 25:04.878
-Just tell me where she is.
-I don't know!

25:04.961 --> 25:06.713
Yes, you-- Hey!

25:09.591 --> 25:10.550
Come back here!

25:16.181 --> 25:17.015
[John] There she is.

25:26.274 --> 25:27.400
Shit! She has my keys!

25:28.652 --> 25:29.903
[both scream]

25:29.986 --> 25:31.446
[tires screech]

25:32.447 --> 25:33.532
Hey!

25:36.159 --> 25:37.869
Get away from me, you crazy bitch!

25:37.953 --> 25:39.371
Watch your language! I'm a lady!

25:40.413 --> 25:41.331
[gasps]

25:43.291 --> 25:45.293
[grunts]

25:45.377 --> 25:46.962
Ah! Stop it!

25:47.629 --> 25:48.797
-Get off of me!
-You're hurting me!

25:48.880 --> 25:49.714
You're hurting me!

25:49.798 --> 25:51.132
[grunting] Ow!

25:51.675 --> 25:52.759
[groans]

25:52.842 --> 25:55.178
-[breathing fast] Sorry!
-You should be!

25:55.262 --> 25:56.638
Tell me where she is!

25:57.514 --> 25:58.473
[sighs]

25:59.933 --> 26:00.976
Fine.

26:01.685 --> 26:02.519
Shit!

26:04.020 --> 26:05.188
I'm Kendra Saint John.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.775
Is that, like, how you identify,

26:08.858 --> 26:11.069
or is this, like,
a case of multiple personalities?

26:11.152 --> 26:11.987
No!

26:12.070 --> 26:14.489
She bailed... and I took over.

26:15.323 --> 26:16.700
No idea where she is.

26:16.783 --> 26:17.951
-A confession!
-Ow!

26:18.451 --> 26:19.619
Now I can bring you in.

26:20.704 --> 26:23.373
Except,
you're not technically the bail skip.

26:23.832 --> 26:24.666
Shit!

26:25.792 --> 26:26.960
Uh...

26:27.043 --> 26:28.587
-I'm gonna go. [groans]
-No!

26:28.670 --> 26:30.505
Not until you promise to refund

26:30.589 --> 26:32.716
all the credit card transactions
that happened today.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.801
And you tell me every single
shred of information

26:34.884 --> 26:36.553
you have on Kendra Saint John.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.471
-Got it?
-[grunts]

26:38.555 --> 26:39.431
I'm waiting.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.268
Um, so, yeah.
That guy was pounding back champagne

26:43.351 --> 26:45.270
and I-- I couldn't let him drive,

26:45.353 --> 26:46.896
but I didn't want to say anything

26:46.980 --> 26:48.940
and, like, bruise his fragile male ego.

26:49.024 --> 26:52.235
So I, you know, just drove him around
while he sobered up.

26:52.319 --> 26:55.113
Which he did, after he threw up
in someone's yard

26:55.196 --> 26:56.323
and then a dog ate it!

26:56.698 --> 26:58.491
Um, cool. Yeah. Glad that's cleared up.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.577
[soft rock music playing]

27:01.494 --> 27:02.454
So...

27:04.205 --> 27:05.540
what the hell is going on?

27:05.624 --> 27:06.916
-What?
-Well,

27:07.000 --> 27:08.877
first, you acted weird when I showed up.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.128
You weren't even, like, happy.

27:10.211 --> 27:11.963
Then you tried to do my job.

27:13.381 --> 27:14.716
Then you went off with that dude!

27:15.383 --> 27:16.426
What's going on?

27:16.509 --> 27:17.385
You started it!

27:18.219 --> 27:20.513
You can't show up unannounced
on a girl like that.

27:20.597 --> 27:21.473
Like, ever.

27:24.184 --> 27:25.018
Okay?

27:27.020 --> 27:28.480
Okay. All right, fine.

27:29.606 --> 27:30.565
Um...

27:30.649 --> 27:32.484
Maybe it wasn't the best surprise?

27:34.486 --> 27:35.445
I'll check next time.

27:37.947 --> 27:38.782
Okay.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.034
Thank you.

27:41.117 --> 27:41.951
Yeah.

27:45.455 --> 27:48.041
You-- You told me that you liked me
because I'm down to earth.

27:48.124 --> 27:52.128
And then, you show up as an employee
at my Richie Rich house

27:52.212 --> 27:53.713
for my mom's Richie Rich party.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.257
I felt embarrassed, like...

27:57.300 --> 27:58.718
like you wouldn't like me anymore,

27:58.802 --> 28:00.512
or think I was cool, or whatever.

28:01.721 --> 28:02.639
For real?

28:02.972 --> 28:04.015
Yeah, for real.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.393
I was hoping the first time
you came to my house

28:06.476 --> 28:09.104
would be, like, as my boyfriend
and, like, totally normal.

28:11.314 --> 28:13.024
Your boyfriend. huh?

28:14.275 --> 28:15.193
Maybe?

28:17.362 --> 28:19.322
Okay, I say we turned this day around.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.283
Oh, this is my driveway.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.827
Uh, the next one on the right.

28:23.910 --> 28:24.786
-Okay.
-Yeah.

28:33.294 --> 28:34.671
All right. Peace.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.297
-Uh, dude.
-What?

28:37.257 --> 28:38.216
You're rich!

28:39.134 --> 28:40.885
You said that your mom worked two jobs.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.846
Well, she's a lawyer and a state senator.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.433
Oh, yeah.

28:48.184 --> 28:49.185
And your dad?

28:49.436 --> 28:50.395
Owns a bank.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.230
But, um, listen,

28:52.313 --> 28:54.065
I gotta go inside and get some shut-eye

28:54.274 --> 28:56.401
so I can wake up in the morning
and call my girlfriend.

28:59.028 --> 29:00.989
Well, your girlfriend's standing by.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.415
[knocking]

29:10.498 --> 29:11.458
[Debbie] May I come in?

29:12.834 --> 29:14.711
-Yes, ma'am.
-[door opens]

29:19.924 --> 29:21.426
Are you disappointed in me?

29:21.801 --> 29:22.761
Oh, honey.

29:28.349 --> 29:29.559
I don't know how I feel.

29:32.020 --> 29:32.854
[exhales deeply]

29:32.937 --> 29:33.772
I just...

29:34.814 --> 29:37.484
I don't understand
how something that feels so good

29:37.567 --> 29:38.860
could be wrong, you know?

29:38.943 --> 29:40.820
The Bible says so many different things

Oh.

30:24.405 --> 30:25.490
That breaks my heart.

30:27.534 --> 30:28.743
You could have told me.

Really?

Oh, honey.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.043
You are my whole world.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.089
I know I can be hard on y'all.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.133
It's not to make you fear me.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.387
It's to make you stronger women.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.557

Oh, I don't know, honey.
I don't have all the answers,

31:43.568 --> 31:44.569
but I do know...

31:46.863 --> 31:50.575
that life and the Lord
put us through challenges.

31:52.410 --> 31:55.914
And through those things, we learn lessons
we can't even imagine learning on our own.

31:56.956 --> 32:01.502
Shoot, I thought the man I was with
before your father was the one.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.591
How did you find out that he wasn't?

You know how you can have a favorite dress

32:14.349 --> 32:16.225
you've been wearing for years, and...

32:16.809 --> 32:18.978
all of a sudden,
one day you look in the mirror, and...

32:19.854 --> 32:21.898
for some reason
it just doesn't suit you anymore?

32:24.609 --> 32:26.527
You don't know why.
It just doesn't look the same.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.155

Not everyone can go with you.

32:34.243 --> 32:35.453
It's nobody's fault.

32:36.704 --> 32:37.914

Oh, good!

Thank goodness.

Yeah. Did you hear that, baby?

34:00.121 --> 34:03.207
We're gonna be okay.
We'll see each other at school,

34:03.291 --> 34:05.585
we'll tell our parents that
were thinking about our choices.

34:05.835 --> 34:06.794
We'll figure it out.
