00:03.120 --> 00:05.540
Dre: Staying happily married
is hard.

00:05.540 --> 00:07.830
The odds aren't great.

00:07.830 --> 00:11.000
How many successful marriages
can you think of?

00:11.000 --> 00:14.460
53% of American marriages fail.

00:14.460 --> 00:16.420
That's like playing
Russian roulette

00:16.420 --> 00:18.540
with a gun that has
three bullets in it.

00:21.670 --> 00:29.750

00:29.750 --> 00:31.500
Now we got ourselves a game.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.210
Didi mao!

00:39.040 --> 00:40.620
You sure
this a good idea?

00:40.620 --> 00:42.420
Mao!

00:42.420 --> 00:44.710
I thought you said
you wanted a guys' night out.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.080
We're going to
Buffalo Wild Wings after this.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.460
Well,
at least one of us will.

00:50.460 --> 00:52.120
Didi mao!

00:52.120 --> 00:53.710
Didi mao!

00:57.080 --> 01:01.170
Every few years, Bow and I
get into a bit of a funk.

01:01.170 --> 01:03.880
Happens to everybody.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.080
Not a big deal.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.920
Unless you can't
get back out...

01:07.920 --> 01:12.290
which happens to
half of everybody.

01:12.290 --> 01:18.580
And as our latest funk
kept getting funkier,

01:18.580 --> 01:22.540
I started to wonder if we had
less of a shot than I thought.

01:22.540 --> 01:23.540

01:39.670 --> 01:42.170
My guy! Hi!

Look at you

01:45.540 --> 01:48.620
Who is she kidding?
That baby can't read.

01:48.620 --> 01:50.330
Rainbow: We'll do the cake
in like half an hour.

01:50.330 --> 01:52.000
Oh!
-Charlie.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.380
Dre: That's a big gift.
What'd you bring?

01:54.380 --> 01:57.170
It is not three loads of laundry
inside of a gift bag.

01:57.170 --> 01:59.000
I know that for sure.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.790
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm...

02:01.790 --> 02:04.790
gonna hide Devante's gift
inside your washing machine.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.500
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm. Okay.

02:06.500 --> 02:10.580
Dre, uh, you wouldn't happen to
have any Woolite

02:10.580 --> 02:13.040
I can pour all over
Devante's gift, would you?

02:13.040 --> 02:14.750
Third drawer on the left.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.920
-My man.
-Dre.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.170
Great party, guys!

02:18.170 --> 02:19.830
Hey! Hey!
Thank you.

02:19.830 --> 02:22.710
I cannot believe
what a big boy he is.
Ohh.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.920
This little cutie must be
walking all over the place.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.170
Oh, he's not yet,
but any day now.

02:27.170 --> 02:29.040
Yep.
-Yep, any day now.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.880
Although all of our other
children were walking by now.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.790
Yes, but he came
six weeks early,

02:33.790 --> 02:36.830
so he's creating his own
developmental timelines.

02:36.830 --> 02:38.750
Which apparently you're
the only one that knows.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.580
Yes, me and a whole bunch
of physicians

02:40.580 --> 02:43.420
who used science to
establish real milestones,

02:43.420 --> 02:45.580
and he is hitting
all those milestones, so.

02:45.580 --> 02:48.250
Huh, I guess the takeaway is
that everything is great.

02:48.250 --> 02:51.330
Ok, I-I'm going to
go get a mimosa

02:51.330 --> 02:53.460
with those childless grown men
over there

02:53.460 --> 02:56.540
who are pretending not to
watch that woman breastfeed.

02:56.540 --> 02:59.710
Excuse me.
-Yeah, you go over there.

02:59.710 --> 03:03.620
Hey, even Ronnie is surprised
that he isn't walking yet,

03:03.620 --> 03:05.210
and she has four kids.

03:05.210 --> 03:09.460
Ronnie is a chiropractor,
so she doesn't know anything.

03:09.460 --> 03:11.830
Yeah, a chiropractor
with babies who walk.

03:11.830 --> 03:13.170
You still don't think

03:13.170 --> 03:14.670
that's enough reason
to go to the doctor?

03:14.670 --> 03:17.380
No, I really don't, Dre,
and I am a doctor.

03:17.380 --> 03:19.040
And like I've told you
hundreds of times,

03:19.040 --> 03:20.460
Devante's gonna be fine.

03:20.460 --> 03:21.920
Hmm.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.920
Okay?
Please stop worrying.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.210
-All right, oh.
-Please. Come here, sweetie.

03:25.210 --> 03:26.750
Come with me.
Come with me.

03:26.750 --> 03:29.670
Okay, come on.

03:29.670 --> 03:32.330
Why do we
have a bouncy house

03:32.330 --> 03:34.420
for a 1-year-old's
birthday party?

03:34.420 --> 03:36.460
Because Devante told me
it's what he wants.

03:36.460 --> 03:40.080
Although he really wishes
this had a water feature.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.080
He said all this to you?

03:42.080 --> 03:43.120
When did he
learn to speak?

03:43.120 --> 03:44.120
I don't know.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.790
Okay.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.460
Ooh, look at tha--

03:47.460 --> 03:50.000
Mmm.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.420
"Happy birthday,
Durante?"

03:52.420 --> 03:53.750
Psh.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.420
I gave them
the right name.

03:55.420 --> 03:56.960
Why didn't you check it
when you picked it up?

03:56.960 --> 03:58.500
Wow.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.420
Okay, that became my fault
really quickly.

04:00.420 --> 04:01.710
All you had to do
was check it.
Yep.

04:01.710 --> 04:04.080
Well, thanks for ruining
my Saturday, Dre.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.790
-You see, where I come from,

04:05.790 --> 04:09.540
a "child's birthday" is code
for scoring cocaine.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.710
-What the hell are y--
-Now, if you will excuse me,

04:11.710 --> 04:13.460
I'm going to
a child's birthday.

04:13.460 --> 04:16.120
Thanks for nothing...
Durante.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.170
Rainbow: Ugh.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.170
Did you really ask...

04:29.170 --> 04:32.670
every single parent

04:32.670 --> 04:34.210
when their kids
started walking?

04:34.210 --> 04:36.580
I wasn't just
asking them about that.

04:36.580 --> 04:40.210
I was also curious to learn
when their kids started

04:40.210 --> 04:42.330
matching their shirts
with their sneakers.

04:42.330 --> 04:45.880
Okay, Junior's gonna get there,
and so is Devante.
Yeah.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.750
Dre, you just got to stop
bringing it up with people.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.250
It's -- It's creepy.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.120
-Okay, well...
-It's, like, weird.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.290
...what am I supposed to do

04:51.290 --> 04:53.080
when people like Ronnie
bring it up to me?

04:53.080 --> 04:54.880
Say, "no comment"?

04:54.880 --> 04:55.960
"But why isn't your son
walking?"

04:55.960 --> 04:57.620
"No comment."

04:57.620 --> 05:01.080
"Why is your son rocking an
Adidas sweatshirt with Jordans?"

05:01.080 --> 05:03.380
"First off, that's not my son,
and no comment."

05:12.380 --> 05:14.710
What are you doing?

05:14.710 --> 05:16.670
You didn't
wash the back.

05:16.670 --> 05:18.330
You know what? Next time,
you just do it yourself, okay,

05:18.330 --> 05:20.670
because I'm out of
the plate-washing game.

05:20.670 --> 05:23.210
I didn't know you were ever
in the plate-washing game.

05:26.540 --> 05:28.080
What's going on with us?

05:31.920 --> 05:33.880
I don't know.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.790
We're just off.

05:36.790 --> 05:39.380
Yeah.

05:39.380 --> 05:43.290
Maybe just...it's like
we're not connecting.

05:43.290 --> 05:45.170
I know.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.210
I hate it.

05:46.210 --> 05:48.170
Me, too.

05:48.170 --> 05:49.750
Babe,
this doesn't feel like us.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.120
I know, I know.

05:56.790 --> 06:00.460
Maybe we should...
go back to couple's therapy.

06:00.460 --> 06:04.250
Go see Dr. Ima for a tune-up
or something.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.580
It's been a while.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.290
Mm-hmm.

06:08.290 --> 06:09.790
Couldn't hurt.

06:09.790 --> 06:12.580
I think it'll be good.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.210
Okay.
Okay?

06:14.210 --> 06:16.420
All right.

06:16.420 --> 06:18.080
Mmm.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.710
Charlie: This feels like
a private conversation

06:21.710 --> 06:23.540
that I'm interrupting.
-Oh, my God.

06:23.540 --> 06:27.290
It's just the fact that your
dryer is having a real problem

06:27.290 --> 06:32.540
with Devante's baby gift of a
king-sized adult-stained duvet.

06:32.540 --> 06:34.420
You know what,
forget about it.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.040
I'll make it work.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.380
Just, uh, point me
to the, uh, clothespins.

06:38.380 --> 06:39.920
Th--

06:39.920 --> 06:41.750
I'll make it work, don't worry.

06:47.830 --> 06:49.290
So Bow and I
went back to therapy.

06:49.290 --> 06:50.380
All we needed was
a friendly, little tune-up.

06:50.380 --> 06:52.210
Durante?

06:52.210 --> 06:55.920
Oh...so you're still on that,
huh?

06:55.920 --> 06:58.420
Okay, well, you didn't say
anything about the balloons

06:58.420 --> 07:01.170
or the streamers
or the great idea I had

07:01.170 --> 07:03.670
to get him a smash cake,
which he had a ball with,

07:03.670 --> 07:05.040
which you would've
never thought of.

07:05.040 --> 07:05.960
Why would I
have thought of it?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.540
I never had one growing up.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.380
Of course you never had one
growing up.
What?

07:09.380 --> 07:12.380
You were never allowed
to eat sugar, flour, dairy,

07:12.380 --> 07:15.120
or anything that produces joy
and happiness.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.880
This is
what I live with.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.460
And I live with
someone who doesn't care

07:18.460 --> 07:20.210
our son isn't walking yet!

07:20.210 --> 07:21.620
You can't
force him to walk.

07:21.620 --> 07:24.420
I'm helping him to walk.
You just don't get it.

07:24.420 --> 07:26.620
Dragging him around
by his arms

07:26.620 --> 07:28.670
isn't gonna help him
learn to walk.

07:28.670 --> 07:31.380
O-Okay, well,
tell me what will help him,

07:31.380 --> 07:33.250
since you have
all the answers.

07:33.250 --> 07:34.620
Why do you
always do that?

07:34.620 --> 07:36.750
I'm gonna stop you.

07:36.750 --> 07:39.120
We're getting into bickering,
and this isn't productive.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.920
After this many
years of marriage

07:40.920 --> 07:42.500
and having a new baby,

07:42.500 --> 07:44.000
things --
And a dog.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.170
Things --
And both of his parents.

07:45.170 --> 07:46.540
-Wh--
-Both of them.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.830
Things have gotten
away from you.

07:48.830 --> 07:50.750
It happens.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.290
You've got to breathe,

07:52.290 --> 07:54.210
remember you're
on the same team,

07:54.210 --> 07:56.080
and devote some time
to each other.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.250
How are we
gonna do that?

07:58.250 --> 08:00.120
Yeah, I mean,
I have so much going on.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.880
I'm not talking about
anything radical --

08:01.880 --> 08:04.120
just a simple night
of reconnection.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.460
A date night.

08:05.460 --> 08:08.460
It's a chance to focus
on each other.

08:08.460 --> 08:12.170
It's saying, "I know
there's a world around me,

08:12.170 --> 08:14.250
but what's important
is in front of me."

08:18.420 --> 08:22.170
It has been forever since
we actually just went out.

08:22.170 --> 08:24.540
Just us.

08:24.540 --> 08:27.920
I don't remember
the last time we did that.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.040
Pick a night.
Right now.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.210
Choose each other.

08:32.210 --> 08:35.000
How about Thursday?

08:37.960 --> 08:39.620
I can do Thur--
I can make that work.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.540
I can make Thursday work.
-Me, too.

08:41.540 --> 08:42.790
-Yeah.

08:46.580 --> 08:48.210
Jack:
Guys, look!

08:48.210 --> 08:50.080
The bouncy house is still here!

08:50.080 --> 08:52.330
Oh, my God.
Thank you, God. Thank you.

08:52.330 --> 08:55.000
I know you saw
my pure heart.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.250
God had nothing
to do with this.

08:57.250 --> 08:59.670
Whoo!
Grandma's seen
this hustle before.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.290
Man "forgets" to pick it up,

09:01.290 --> 09:03.120
then charges you
for the extra day.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.920
Oh, no!

09:04.920 --> 09:09.170
A scam like that could cost Mom
and Dad twenties of dollars!

09:09.170 --> 09:11.380
This is incredible!

09:11.380 --> 09:13.420
Maybe we can
keep this forever!

09:13.420 --> 09:16.080
Yeah, that's exactly what
he needs -- more brain jostling.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.380
Oh,
I could live out here.

09:18.380 --> 09:20.120
And you definitely
should!

09:20.120 --> 09:21.620
I'll give you
all my tooth fairy money

09:21.620 --> 09:23.210
if you help me get his bed
out of my room.

09:23.210 --> 09:24.460
Check this out.

09:29.460 --> 09:32.040
You know what, uh,
how's the steak?

09:32.040 --> 09:33.710
-It's --
-Eh, i-it doesn't matter

09:33.710 --> 09:36.540
because I am going to go
with the scampi.

09:36.540 --> 09:37.960
-Okay.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.750
-It's very --
-Uh...

09:39.750 --> 09:41.830
Between the scampi
and the chicken,

09:41.830 --> 09:42.960
which would you
recommend?

09:42.960 --> 09:44.120
Ah, you know what?
Don't --

09:44.120 --> 09:46.380
Don't even worry about it
because...

09:46.380 --> 09:47.830
I am gonna
go for the steak.

09:47.830 --> 09:48.790
-Okay, and I wi--
-No!

09:50.210 --> 09:51.380
Scampi.

09:51.380 --> 09:53.420
Yep, yep. Scampi.

09:53.420 --> 09:54.540
I'm done.

09:54.540 --> 09:56.380
Oh.
I'll have the trout, please.

09:56.380 --> 09:59.420
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

09:59.420 --> 10:01.960
Are you seriously streaming
ESPN Plus right now?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.880
I have to enjoy something
tonight.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.830
Mm.

10:06.830 --> 10:08.670
You know what, babe?

10:08.670 --> 10:09.880
I'm sorry about
the ordering thing.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.880
Oh, God.
Please, no. It's fine.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.000
I'm actually really glad
we did this.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.710
-Yeah.
-It's nice.

10:16.710 --> 10:17.710
-It is.
-It's nice.

10:17.710 --> 10:18.790
-Mm-hmm. Yep.
-Yes, yes.

10:18.790 --> 10:20.170
Cheers!

10:20.170 --> 10:22.290
Cheers.
You look nice.

10:22.290 --> 10:23.710
You don't have to
do that.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.620
No, I mean it, babe.

10:25.620 --> 10:28.040
You look nice.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.120
Thank you.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.750
It's actually
really nice to hear.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.790
"Actually"?

10:34.790 --> 10:37.830
I compliment you
all the time.

10:37.830 --> 10:40.500
Okay, Dre.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.790
You say that like
I don't compliment you.

10:41.790 --> 10:43.420
Baby, I compliment you.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.790
Okay.

10:45.790 --> 10:47.920
More than you compliment me.
Hm.

10:49.540 --> 10:51.250
That's why I said "okay,"
Dre.
Uh-huh.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.250
Because
no matter what I said,

10:52.250 --> 10:53.500
you would turn it
into a big deal

10:53.500 --> 10:55.380
because you turn everything
into a big deal.

10:55.380 --> 10:56.750
Oh, I make a big deal
out of everything?

10:56.750 --> 10:58.790
Yes, the same way
you're making a big deal

10:58.790 --> 10:59.920
out of the fact that I said

10:59.920 --> 11:01.460
you make a big deal
out of everything.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.500
Okay, well, now I feel like
it's a set-up.

11:03.500 --> 11:07.500
You know, everything I say
is automatically a big deal.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.000
It's exactly what you did
at the therapist's office

11:09.000 --> 11:10.880
about Devante.
-Mm-hmm.

11:10.880 --> 11:11.750
Yeah, you wouldn't stop
talking about it

11:11.750 --> 11:13.120
because you're obsessed.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.330
Oh, you got me.

11:15.330 --> 11:18.080
I'm obsessed with
my baby's health.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.580
A loving father
who cares about his child.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.420
Ooh, such a monster.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.250
Fine.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.880
I'm the bad guy.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.420
Finally, you admit it.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.540
Wh--

11:29.540 --> 11:31.540
Do you know how hard it is
dealing with you constantly?

11:31.540 --> 11:34.290
Like you are
a kiss of sunshine.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.460
Oh, my God. Okay.
Where is our food?

11:36.460 --> 11:38.330
We can leave right now.
We don't have to eat here.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.540
You don't even know
what you ordered.

11:39.540 --> 11:41.080
-Steak.
-Scampi.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.250
I said steak.
No scampi.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.290
He thinks
you ordered scampi.

11:44.290 --> 11:45.580
Ok, well,
he'll be wrong.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.420

-This is whack.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.830
This whole thing is whack.

12:03.830 --> 12:06.120
We just need to get
back into our flow.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.290
Right.

12:11.790 --> 12:13.120
We have a flow?

12:13.120 --> 12:16.290
We definitely
have a flow.

12:16.290 --> 12:20.290
You...love...our flow.

Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

Flow looks good on you, too,
baby.

12:26.290 --> 12:28.290
Let's do it.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.540
Oh, you know I'm down.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.710
Mm-hmm.

12:33.330 --> 12:36.540
You know, I would be
more down tomorrow,

12:36.540 --> 12:38.580
because I think I overdid it
with the "scrimp."

12:38.580 --> 12:40.620
Even better because,
you know what,

12:40.620 --> 12:41.880
if we do it tomorrow night,
we can plan it,

12:41.880 --> 12:43.420
we can make it
really special.

12:43.420 --> 12:44.710
-Great.
-Yeah.

12:44.710 --> 12:47.120

13:02.080 --> 13:04.920
Okay, Mason,
are you enjoying these jumps?
Yeah.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.080

13:06.080 --> 13:07.750
That was just
your trial membership.

Time to get real.
Here are your bouncing packages.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.170
What's happening?

13:12.170 --> 13:13.540
Diane, stop.

It's not fun when
you bring money into it.

13:15.710 --> 13:18.380
No, Jack. It isn't fun
until you bring money into it.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.920
Now, Mason, you can do
50 cents a jump,

13:21.920 --> 13:24.880
or jump unlimited the whole day
for $50.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.120
Unlimited
sounds good.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.880
Of course it does.

Do you want to talk night rates

13:32.670 --> 13:34.380
I just want to jump.

13:43.830 --> 13:48.080
All day long,
my elegant, sophisticated wife

13:48.080 --> 13:51.790
had been sexting me
like a drunk sorority girl.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.830
And it felt good having a
little secret just between us.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.420
-Dre.
-Hey.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.170
How was couples' therapy?

13:58.170 --> 14:00.920
Wait a minute, you didn't
save your marriage, did you?

14:00.920 --> 14:04.620
Because I can't take these
flowers back to the cemetery.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.620
It's --
It's haunted.

14:06.620 --> 14:09.620
I-I'm sorry, but if you were
trying couples' therapy,

14:09.620 --> 14:11.040
it's already over.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.500
But on the bright side,

14:12.500 --> 14:14.920
you are about to get invited
to my yacht parties.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.620
BYO
horse tranquilizers.

14:17.620 --> 14:20.580
Okay, guys,
my marriage is fine,

14:20.580 --> 14:23.170
and couples' therapy
is just something that

14:23.170 --> 14:28.290
normal, happy husbands and wives
do to maintain happy marriages.

14:28.290 --> 14:30.000
You got a white girl
on the side, don't you?

14:32.710 --> 14:33.500
O

14:33.500 --> 14:36.210
Hey! White woman!

14:36.210 --> 14:37.920
Are you having sex
with Black Dre?

14:37.920 --> 14:40.960
I do not have a side chick,
Daphne, okay.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.710
I love my wife,

14:42.710 --> 14:45.330
but sometimes couples
need to be reminded

14:45.330 --> 14:47.040
that you are
on the same team

14:47.040 --> 14:48.460
and that you need to devote

14:48.460 --> 14:50.670
a little extra time
to one another.

14:50.670 --> 14:52.750
She didn't make you go on
a date night, did she?

14:52.750 --> 14:54.830
She didn't
make me do anything.

14:54.830 --> 14:57.790
I mean
And date nights are great.

14:57.790 --> 14:59.380
They're just a way to say that,

14:59.380 --> 15:01.750
"I know there's
a world around me,

15:01.750 --> 15:04.710
but what's important
is in front of me."

15:04.710 --> 15:08.120
Are you saying that you chose
to go out with your wife

15:08.120 --> 15:10.750
for no reason?
-Yeah.

15:10.750 --> 15:12.580
Hilarious.
You know what?

15:12.580 --> 15:15.080
Keep an eye out
for the real kiss of death --

15:15.080 --> 15:16.750
scheduled sex.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.830
What's -- What's wrong
with scheduled sex?

15:18.830 --> 15:21.710
People don't schedule sex, Dre.

15:21.710 --> 15:23.670
That's crazy.

15:23.670 --> 15:26.790
Any time I've had sex,
it's always been a surprise.

15:26.790 --> 15:28.210
A surprise for who?

15:28.210 --> 15:31.500
For me
because I'm a freak in the gym.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.170
You remember that.

15:33.170 --> 15:35.670
I think scheduled sex
is a great idea.

15:35.670 --> 15:37.420
That way I don't
walk in on my mom.

15:37.420 --> 15:38.960
-Oof.
-Dre!

15:38.960 --> 15:40.670
You don't have to
schedule it.

15:40.670 --> 15:41.920
Just whip it out.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.250
White girls love that.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.290
I --

15:44.290 --> 15:45.670
It's that bitch,
isn't it?

15:45.670 --> 15:47.330
-Rita, come here.

15:47.330 --> 15:48.540
Talk to you.

15:48.540 --> 15:49.620
Stevens: You and Rita?

15:49.620 --> 15:52.000
Ooh, a lot of horses
run on that track.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.120
Ugh.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.000
I wasn't gonna let these
idiots at work get in my head.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.670
Scheduled sex
may have had a bad rap,

16:02.670 --> 16:05.500
but I was about to get in there
and change the game.

16:08.790 --> 16:09.920
Hey.

16:11.540 --> 16:12.670
Hey.

Why not?
Just go in.
Okay.

like it down, babe.

Okay. Well, you know,
let's just put it back up.

17:14.580 --> 17:16.330
Okay, keep -- Just leave it.
I got it, I got it.

17:16.330 --> 17:18.750
Seriously, I've got it.
I got it.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.830

Devante into this right now?

17:41.460 --> 17:42.790
I'm sorry.
Wh-- Because --

17:42.790 --> 17:44.580

huh?

17:46.120 --> 17:47.540
Yes, Dre.

17:47.540 --> 17:49.000
You're always talking about

17:49.000 --> 17:50.670
how you're worried that
he's behind schedule.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.040
Because I am!

17:52.040 --> 17:53.750
Okay, but you're always ta--

Great, well...

Okay, so,
I-I'll just go get him

Wait, what are you --
what are you talking about?

18:03.670 --> 18:05.380

-I said I was gonna do it.
-Hey, it's cool.

18:10.210 --> 18:11.710
I got it, all right?
-I said -- I said I'll go.

-I'll get him.
-I'll do it.

Come on. Come on.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.830
I never said
I was sure about anything.

19:38.830 --> 19:42.830
I was just as worried as you,
I just --

19:42.830 --> 19:46.210
I mean, being worried
isn't gonna help the situation.

19:46.210 --> 19:47.790
Oh, hold on.

19:47.790 --> 19:48.880
You --
You thought something

19:48.880 --> 19:50.210
might've been wrong
with our son,

19:50.210 --> 19:52.000
and you were just gonna
sit back and roll the dice

19:52.000 --> 19:54.330
and not do anything
about it?

19:54.330 --> 19:56.250
Dre...

19:58.380 --> 20:01.830
...I see what all those kids
go through

20:01.830 --> 20:04.500
with those
developmental tests,

20:04.500 --> 20:06.830
and it is so hard
on those babies,

20:06.830 --> 20:09.460
and I just didn't want Devante
to have to go through that

20:09.460 --> 20:10.790
if he didn't need it.

20:10.790 --> 20:14.080
Okay, if you felt like that,
why didn't you let me know

20:14.080 --> 20:16.250
so I wouldn't feel like I was
going through this by myself?

20:16.250 --> 20:18.210
Because I knew
that you were gonna

20:18.210 --> 20:23.580
jump right into crisis mode
and not let it play itself out.

20:23.580 --> 20:26.080
Okay, and what if there happened
to be a crisis?

20:26.080 --> 20:28.000
Okay.
Oh, my God. Wow.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.920
Yeah.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.420
You are relentless,
Dre.

20:31.420 --> 20:33.000
This is why I didn't tell you
how I was feeling.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.620
What?
Because you were
gonna criticize me

20:34.620 --> 20:36.580
for not handling it
exactly the way you do.

20:36.580 --> 20:39.250
Uh, because I don't like
the way you handle things.

20:45.710 --> 20:46.790
You know what?

20:46.790 --> 20:51.290
I am starting to realize

20:51.290 --> 20:55.580
that you and I see the world
differently.
