OH, I'M STILL GONNA
MISS YOU SO MUCH.

01:19:55.369 --> 01:19:57.454
MOM, WE'RE ONLY GONNA BE
TWO MILES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER,

01:19:57.455 --> 01:19:59.998
AND WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER
EVERY FRIDAY FOR DINNER.

01:19:59.999 --> 01:20:02.792
ARE THESE MY BABY TEETH?

01:20:04.295 --> 01:20:05.295
I JUST LIKE TO THINK

01:20:05.296 --> 01:20:07.005
YOU'RE ALWAYS SMILING AT ME,

01:20:07.006 --> 01:20:09.216
NO MATTER
HOW FAR AWAY YOU ARE.

01:20:09.217 --> 01:20:11.801
LUNCH IS SERVED.

01:20:11.802 --> 01:20:13.178
OH!

01:20:13.179 --> 01:20:14.638
THANK YOU, HON.

01:20:14.639 --> 01:20:19.017
AH, NO PECORINO
OR TRUFFLE OIL?

01:20:19.018 --> 01:20:20.477
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOIN'?

01:20:20.478 --> 01:20:22.270
THIS WOMAN SLAVED
FOR HOURS...

01:20:22.271 --> 01:20:23.730
MINUTES.

01:20:23.731 --> 01:20:25.357
...MINUTES
OVER YOUR LUNCH.

01:20:25.358 --> 01:20:26.775
YOU WILL
APPRECIATE IT,

01:20:26.776 --> 01:20:27.817
AND HER.

01:20:27.818 --> 01:20:29.319
SHE'S A DOCTOR.

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.654
THANKS, MOM.

01:20:30.655 --> 01:20:33.031
OH, YOU JUST
CALLED ME "MOM."

01:20:33.032 --> 01:20:36.326
SO CAN I GET
THE PECORINO OR...?

01:20:36.327 --> 01:20:38.328
NO!

01:20:38.329 --> 01:20:41.331
♪ AH, AH, AH, AH ALL OVER... ♪

01:20:41.332 --> 01:20:44.417
CAN YOU GUYS GO BACK TO
HATING EACH OTHER?

01:20:44.418 --> 01:20:45.710
NO.

01:20:45.711 --> 01:20:48.171
♪ AH, AH, ALL OVER AGAIN... ♪

01:20:48.172 --> 01:20:49.464
MM!

01:20:49.465 --> 01:20:51.049
COFFEE TIME!

01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:52.175
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:20:52.176 --> 01:20:54.386
WHY SO MANY APARTMENTS
DON'T ALLOW DOGS.

01:20:54.387 --> 01:20:56.263
THEY'RE CLEANER
AND QUIETER,

01:20:56.264 --> 01:20:57.889
AND WAY LESS TROUBLE
THAN MEN.

01:20:57.890 --> 01:21:00.225
YOU SHOULD CHECK THIS
BULLETIN BOARD AT THE HOSPITAL

01:21:00.226 --> 01:21:01.601
WITH AVAILABLE APARTMENTS.

01:21:01.602 --> 01:21:04.396
DOES IT ALSO
LIST AVAILABLE DOCTORS?

01:21:04.397 --> 01:21:06.189
NO!

01:21:06.190 --> 01:21:10.110
I AM TAKING A BREAK
FROM MEN.

01:21:11.445 --> 01:21:12.487
WILLIS?

01:21:12.488 --> 01:21:13.822
WILLIS!

01:21:13.823 --> 01:21:15.407
WILLIS, COME HERE!

01:21:15.408 --> 01:21:16.741
COME HERE, BOY.

01:21:16.742 --> 01:21:19.035
WILLIS! WILLIS!

01:21:19.036 --> 01:21:21.496
WHO'S THIS? WHO'S THIS?
WILLIS!

01:21:21.497 --> 01:21:23.331
"WILLIS"?

01:21:23.332 --> 01:21:24.708
I SAW THE SIGN IN THE WINDOW!

01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:27.460
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'VE FOUND WILLIS!

01:21:27.461 --> 01:21:29.588
UH, NO.
HIS NAME IS NOT "WILLIS."

01:21:29.589 --> 01:21:30.755
IT'S "PUFFY,"

01:21:30.756 --> 01:21:32.173
AND HE'S MINE.

01:21:32.174 --> 01:21:35.010
I REMEMBER YOU.

01:21:35.011 --> 01:21:37.554
YOU HAVE BEEN
TAKING CARE OF WILLIS?

01:21:37.555 --> 01:21:39.264
WOW, BUDDY!

01:21:39.265 --> 01:21:41.558
NO WONDER YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO COME HOME.

01:21:41.559 --> 01:21:44.144
THANK YOU
SO, SO MUCH!

01:21:44.145 --> 01:21:46.062
THE GARDENER
LEFT THE BACK GATE OPEN.

01:21:46.063 --> 01:21:48.231
I'VE BEEN WORRIED SICK
ABOUT THIS GUY!

01:21:48.232 --> 01:21:50.400
PUFFY-WUFFY IS YOUR DOG?

01:21:50.401 --> 01:21:51.526
YEAH.

01:21:51.527 --> 01:21:54.321
UM, MY EX-WIFE,
SHE INSISTED ON THE PRE-NUP,

01:21:54.322 --> 01:21:55.697
AND SO I INSISTED ON THE DOG.

01:21:55.698 --> 01:21:58.074
I JUST LOVE THIS LITTLE RASCAL.

01:21:58.075 --> 01:22:00.410
I PUT SIGNS UP ALL OVER TOWN.

01:22:00.411 --> 01:22:01.745
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL?

01:22:01.746 --> 01:22:04.247
I DID.
NO ONE ANSWERED.

01:22:04.248 --> 01:22:05.582
OH, RIGHT.

01:22:05.583 --> 01:22:08.585
HE ACTUALLY RUINED
MY ANSWERING MACHINE

01:22:08.586 --> 01:22:10.545
BY PEEING ON IT.

01:22:10.546 --> 01:22:13.423
YEAH... WE'VE BEEN
WORKING ON THAT, HAVEN'T WE?

01:22:15.509 --> 01:22:16.886
YOU OKAY?

01:22:18.638 --> 01:22:20.848
YEAH, I...

01:22:22.516 --> 01:22:24.768
IT'S JUST...

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:28.647
I'VE BEEN TAKING
CARE OF HIM,

01:22:28.648 --> 01:22:30.649
AND...

01:22:30.650 --> 01:22:32.902
I LOVE HIM.

01:22:34.195 --> 01:22:36.279
YEAH.
WELL, LOOK AT THAT, BUDDY.

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:39.783
YOU'RE BREAKING HEARTS
EVERYWHERE YOU GO.

01:22:39.784 --> 01:22:42.285
I'VE HAD HIM SINCE...
SINCE HE WAS A PUPPY.

01:22:42.286 --> 01:22:46.373
I'M REALLY SORRY,
BUT HE'S... HE'S MY DOG.

01:22:48.376 --> 01:22:50.460
I KNOW.

01:22:50.461 --> 01:22:52.630
HE'S YOURS.

01:22:55.299 --> 01:22:57.759
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU FOUND
YOUR OWNER, PUFFY.

01:22:59.637 --> 01:23:02.639
NOW, YOU BE GOOD FOR MR. HUNKY.

01:23:05.851 --> 01:23:08.478
HERE.

01:23:08.479 --> 01:23:10.980
OH, NO. I-I DON'T NEED
A REWARD.

01:23:10.981 --> 01:23:13.358
IT WAS FINE.

01:23:13.359 --> 01:23:15.527
OH, NO.
IT'S, UM, IT'S MY NUMBER.

01:23:15.528 --> 01:23:18.321
YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY TAKEN
SUCH GOOD CARE OF HIM.

01:23:18.322 --> 01:23:19.781
YOU DESERVE
A MASSIVE THANK-YOU.

01:23:19.782 --> 01:23:21.449

THERE'LL BE DRINKS
AND DANCING...

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:25.370
I... I... I DON'T KNOW.

01:23:25.371 --> 01:23:26.955
WELL, OKAY.

01:23:26.956 --> 01:23:28.289
WELL, SUIT YOURSELF,

01:23:28.290 --> 01:23:30.667
BUT ALL I ASK
IS THAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

01:23:30.668 --> 01:23:32.544
OKAY. I WILL.

01:23:32.545 --> 01:23:33.628
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

01:23:33.629 --> 01:23:36.548
AND WE CAN DISCUSS
VISITATION RIGHTS.

01:23:37.717 --> 01:23:40.553
OKAY, WAIT.
ACTUALLY, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

01:23:41.512 --> 01:23:42.887
UM... YOU HUNGRY?

01:23:42.888 --> 01:23:44.389
HOW ABOUT NOW?

01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:45.724
WELL, I'M STARVING.

01:23:45.725 --> 01:23:48.309
UM, JUST...
JUST SO THAT YOU KNOW,

01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:50.437
HE'S BEEN ON
A RAW-FOOD DIET?

01:23:50.438 --> 01:23:51.604
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

01:23:51.605 --> 01:23:53.523
'CAUSE HIS COAT IS
SO SOFT AND SHINY.

01:23:53.524 --> 01:23:54.607
THAT MAKES SENSE.

01:23:54.608 --> 01:23:55.692
YEAH. I DID THAT.

01:23:55.693 --> 01:23:57.485
HE WAS A LITTLE BIT FAT
WHEN I FOUND HIM.

01:23:57.486 --> 01:23:58.653
- SO I THOUGHT...
- FAT?

01:23:58.654 --> 01:24:01.448
