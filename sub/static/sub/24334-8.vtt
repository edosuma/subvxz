00:40.074 --> 00:43.043
SYD:
The monk is dead.

00:43.077 --> 00:46.847
So how are we going
to find Farouk's body?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.782
David?

00:52.086 --> 00:55.055
I'm thinking.

00:55.089 --> 00:58.459
Someone else must know.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.928
Who?

01:00.961 --> 01:02.963
What about me?

01:02.996 --> 01:05.966
In the future.

01:05.999 --> 01:09.237
-No.
-Hmm.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.071
You asked her?

01:11.105 --> 01:16.076
No, but we... we're done.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.712
Did...

01:18.746 --> 01:20.248
we... did...

01:20.281 --> 01:22.816
:
did we get in a fight?

01:22.850 --> 01:25.653
No, but we're...

01:25.686 --> 01:29.923
me and her, we're not seeing
eye to eye right now, so...

01:29.957 --> 01:32.226
-So we got in a fight.
-Syd.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.128
-No.

01:34.162 --> 01:37.097
We just need... we just need
to find the body fast

01:37.131 --> 01:39.032
and finish this thing.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.506
Are we helping him?

01:45.539 --> 01:47.040
Farouk.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.953
What about the end of the world?

02:02.356 --> 02:04.492
One thing at a time.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.065
Hey, hey.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.096
Admiral?

03:52.266 --> 03:54.268
BRUBAKER:
What's that you're reading?

03:59.273 --> 04:01.975
"Everything is unheimlich

04:02.009 --> 04:04.412
"that ought to have remained
secret and hidden

04:04.445 --> 04:06.447
but has come to light."

04:11.685 --> 04:14.555
Is there a place we could talk?

04:14.588 --> 04:16.256
In private.

04:16.290 --> 04:21.495
I was a student here once,
a lifetime ago.

04:21.529 --> 04:24.264
The world was...

04:24.298 --> 04:28.402
not innocent, but more so.

04:28.436 --> 04:33.273
Our thoughts were our own.
Private.

04:33.307 --> 04:36.009
Do you understand?

04:36.043 --> 04:39.480
Not so now.

04:39.513 --> 04:43.116
There are listeners, watchers,

04:43.150 --> 04:45.686
creatures from science fiction,

04:45.719 --> 04:49.690
telepaths who can read
our minds, steal our secrets.

04:49.723 --> 04:54.294
We are vulnerable, you and I...

04:54.328 --> 04:56.797
our secrets.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.699
But more important,

04:58.732 --> 05:02.836
senators, presidents.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.439
And so there is a plan.

05:05.473 --> 05:09.309
Create a mind
that can't be read.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.978
One of our own.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.348
The secret keeper.

05:14.382 --> 05:17.284
Why are you telling me this?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.987
Because of your tests,

05:20.020 --> 05:23.156
the boy who's never been sick,

05:23.190 --> 05:26.059
who heals.

05:26.093 --> 05:29.630
You have a gift.

05:29.663 --> 05:33.100
You a a gift.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.738
On your application

05:37.771 --> 05:41.141
you wrote you'd do anything
for your country.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.176
: Was that a lie?
-FUKYAMA: No.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.846
BRUBAKER:
Then do this.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.916
:
Keep our secrets.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.656
DOCTOR :
How old are you?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.925
Seventeen.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.615
HUSH WOMAN:
"'You may not see it now,'

06:21.649 --> 06:23.551

over P.A.)

08:58.572 --> 09:01.541
Is there something...?

09:01.575 --> 09:03.911
David.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.881
Yeah?

09:07.915 --> 09:11.719
It's me. Ptonomy.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.258
Not funny.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.528
I don't know how long
I can-can-can keep control.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.564
Wait. Are you alive?

09:24.598 --> 09:29.770
I exist in their machine,
preserved.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.772
Is that alive?

09:34.274 --> 09:35.909
The Monk.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.879
He hacked the Admiral's mind.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.280
The mainframe.

09:40.313 --> 09:43.116
Remember? The wires.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.786
Well, the mainframe
hacked him back.

09:45.819 --> 09:49.589
And I saw him, here,
in the computer,

09:49.623 --> 09:52.159
his memory.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.560
And?

09:53.593 --> 09:54.828
I know where to five...

09:57.631 --> 09:59.232
Five?

09:59.266 --> 10:03.503
Five... find-find-find
Farouk's body.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.575
Where?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.443
A place called...

10:27.661 --> 10:28.628
Hey.

10:28.662 --> 10:32.132
A place called...?

It-it can't be.

11:43.236 --> 11:47.875
As you were m-many years ago.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.642
How?

12:00.720 --> 12:04.557
No way to plan for such things.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.393
The professor?

12:06.426 --> 12:08.128
Is not here.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.768
My body.

12:14.802 --> 12:18.305
Where did you take it?

12:18.338 --> 12:21.308
If I tell,

will you give me

Mm.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.235
Beautiful.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.436

14:27.067 --> 14:29.869
DAVID 2: No, if we tell, then
Farouk can read their minds.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.024
I'm not sure.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.473
Don't do that.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.475
What?

16:48.508 --> 16:52.645
Look at me like I'm in a zoo.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.598
How are you?

17:11.631 --> 17:13.066
Who cares?

17:13.100 --> 17:15.034
Me.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.906
-I always cared.
-Hmm.

17:27.447 --> 17:30.583
What?

17:30.617 --> 17:32.785
Oh...

17:32.819 --> 17:36.956
Amy did that
when she was nervous.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.795
Look, man, I...
it wasn't my call, okay?

17:42.829 --> 17:44.631
I know, I just...

17:44.664 --> 17:47.267
Is there anything left in there?

17:47.300 --> 17:48.935
Of her?

17:52.972 --> 17:54.407
Tell me something.

17:54.441 --> 17:58.545
And don't screw with me, okay?

17:58.578 --> 18:00.480
Am I...?

18:03.316 --> 18:05.118
Am I really here?

18:05.152 --> 18:09.389
'Cause if I'm not, and I wake up
back there, with him...

18:09.422 --> 18:11.558
No, you're here.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.926
Hey, you're here.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.095
With me.

MAN :

-know your symptoms.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.688
Confusion.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.756
Irritability.

If you feel any
of these symptoms,

DAVID:
Gone to kill the monster.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.568
*

21:01.961 --> 21:03.930
A poem.

21:03.963 --> 21:09.302
"America, I've given you all
and now I am nothing."

21:12.305 --> 21:16.142
"America, $2.27,

21:16.175 --> 21:19.712
January 17, 1956."

21:21.981 --> 21:25.552
"I can't stand my own mind."

21:29.121 --> 21:34.461
"America, when will we end
the human war?"

21:49.476 --> 21:52.278
SYD:
She never married, my mom.

21:52.311 --> 21:57.183
It was just boyfriend,
boyfriend, fling.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.318
Sometimes they were younger.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.888
Sometimes they were married.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.723
"Joan. Oh, Joan.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.358
Please, Joan."

22:05.392 --> 22:08.160
She was the tragic lay.

22:08.194 --> 22:12.331
The one they couldn't touch.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.000
Uh, what does this have
to do with...?

22:14.033 --> 22:17.970
I'm saying maybe it's my fault.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.039
Maybe I...

22:20.072 --> 22:22.074
pushed him away.

22:24.711 --> 22:28.515
Or maybe the universe
just has a sick sense of humor.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.518
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Untouchable Barretts.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.520
No, that's not funny.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.388
Nope.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.390
Or maybe it's him.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.660
Or maybe it's him.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.530
-Yes, he did.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.532
Did he tell you
where he was going?

22:45.565 --> 22:47.166
No, he did not.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.168
Has he done that before?

22:49.201 --> 22:50.537
Officially?

22:50.570 --> 22:52.204
Off the record.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.273
Just girl talk.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.082
All right,
if you're saying something,

23:03.115 --> 23:05.051
you got to say it out loud.

23:06.886 --> 23:10.156
I'm going after him.

23:14.093 --> 23:17.964
I loved a boy in the army
who kept jumping out of planes

23:17.997 --> 23:20.066
to get away from me.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.403
And then?

23:24.437 --> 23:27.907
Well, and then one day
his chute didn't open.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.881
-He's just different now.
-Mm.

23:34.914 --> 23:38.818
In the hospital
it was so romantic meeting him.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.455
I needed that.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.390
To be seen.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.626
Love.

23:46.659 --> 23:49.261
And then we escaped
and went to Summerland,

23:49.295 --> 23:51.664
and it was addictive
and intense and sweet.

23:51.698 --> 23:54.433
He's a good... person.

23:54.467 --> 23:55.868
You know?

23:57.203 --> 23:59.839
He tries so hard.

24:01.774 --> 24:05.645
But can we agree
that he's unwell?

24:05.678 --> 24:07.947
What does that mean?

24:07.980 --> 24:09.816
You tell me.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.785
*

24:12.819 --> 24:15.722
Maybe he doesn't know...

24:18.891 --> 24:20.292
Go on.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.194
...the difference

24:22.228 --> 24:24.864
between things
real and not real,

24:24.897 --> 24:26.332
right and wrong...

24:26.365 --> 24:28.467
So he's delusional,
you're saying.

24:28.501 --> 24:29.836
No.

24:31.538 --> 24:34.173
I don't know.

24:34.206 --> 24:37.209
Have you ever seen him lie?

24:37.243 --> 24:40.112
-CLARK: No.
-I know. Me neither.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.448
But I think he lies...

24:42.481 --> 24:44.717
all the time.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.219
What about?

24:47.253 --> 24:49.355
What he does.

24:49.388 --> 24:51.423
What he knows.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.160
And yet...

24:55.427 --> 24:56.996
And yet...

25:07.506 --> 25:11.443
Who teaches us to be normal
when we're one of a kind?

25:12.912 --> 25:15.582
*

25:15.615 --> 25:17.584
You don't trust him.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.851
No.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.787
That's not...

25:22.288 --> 25:24.190
I love what we were.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.793
I'm just not sure
we're that anymore.

25:28.561 --> 25:32.064
All right, I feel like
I need to say out loud

25:32.098 --> 25:33.900
that your boyfriend

25:33.933 --> 25:37.336
is an extremely powerful mutant
who could potentially destroy

25:37.369 --> 25:39.739
the world if he wanted to,

25:39.772 --> 25:44.410
or if, say, you hurt
his feelings real bad.

25:55.588 --> 25:58.524
I'm going after him.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.760
Because of what I just said?

26:02.261 --> 26:04.697
Because love is
what we have to save

26:04.731 --> 26:06.899
if we're gonna save the world.

26:09.602 --> 26:12.338
I'm just not sure
that's what he's doing.

26:13.973 --> 26:17.309
*

27:08.060 --> 27:09.996
DAVID 2:
On your mark.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.504
Get set.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.773
WOMAN :
Reminder-- a loss of meaning

27:20.807 --> 27:22.541
is not normal.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.877
*

27:26.145 --> 27:27.613
DAVID 2:
Go.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.713
*

28:13.793 --> 28:15.728
*

28:40.753 --> 28:44.456
*

29:06.178 --> 29:08.114
*

29:30.202 --> 29:32.171
Is he following?

29:32.204 --> 29:34.506
A day behind, maybe more.

29:40.146 --> 29:43.482
Ah, sacrement.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.751
I know this place.

29:45.784 --> 29:49.188
We have been here before.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.957
My body.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.861
So... we're close.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.695
Time and space is relative here.

30:00.867 --> 30:03.669
Sometimes by the hour.

30:03.702 --> 30:07.639
It's part of the trick--
to keep me from myself.

30:13.212 --> 30:16.048
OLIVER:
And David?

30:16.082 --> 30:19.051
FAROUK: Our lost boy
will wander this no place

30:19.085 --> 30:21.220
for the rest of his life

30:21.253 --> 30:25.757
unless...
he figures out the secret.

31:17.776 --> 31:20.012
To be fair,
I left a note this time.

31:20.046 --> 31:22.781
-I believe I also wrote

31:22.814 --> 31:25.417
-"I love you," but yeah.
-Is this because of something

31:25.451 --> 31:27.519
I said in the future?

31:27.553 --> 31:28.754
No.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.289
Maybe. A little.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.524
We definitely got in a fight.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.526
You have a plan, okay,
in the future.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.963
Help Farouk now
so that he can help us later.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.465
But there's got to be
another way. Ow!

31:39.498 --> 31:42.768
-I'm... on your side!
-Aah. Aah.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.270
Asshole!

31:45.904 --> 31:49.808
Whatever some maybe me
in the future says.

31:49.841 --> 31:52.044
-Yes, ma'am.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.980
Aah.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.948
-Now...

31:57.950 --> 32:00.052
What is this place?

32:00.086 --> 32:02.254
Le Désolé.

32:11.964 --> 32:14.166
DAVID:
Really hurt.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.635
SYD:
So, where's the monastery?

32:16.668 --> 32:19.805
DAVID: I saw it,
but I think it's moving.

32:19.838 --> 32:22.174
SYD:
How can a building move?

32:22.208 --> 32:24.143
DAVID:
I don't know.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.331
*

33:14.860 --> 33:17.229
*

33:45.591 --> 33:47.526
*

33:59.438 --> 34:01.607
FAROUK:
Hustle up, my man.

34:02.974 --> 34:04.076
We are almost there.

34:23.462 --> 34:26.498
NARRATOR: And now we come to the
most alarming delusion of all.

34:28.434 --> 34:31.437
The idea that other people
don't matter.

34:31.470 --> 34:34.406
Their feelings. Their needs.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.152
Imagine a cave
where those inside

34:46.185 --> 34:48.320
never see the outside world.

34:53.992 --> 34:55.494
Instead, they see shadows

34:55.527 --> 34:59.131
of that world projected
on the cave wall.

35:09.375 --> 35:12.978
The world they see
in the shadows...

35:20.719 --> 35:22.688
MAN:
Three, two, one, liftoff.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.290
NARRATOR:
But it's real to them.

35:26.392 --> 35:30.196
If you were to show them
the world as it actually is,

35:30.229 --> 35:32.998
they would reject it as...

35:40.739 --> 35:43.509
Now what if,
instead of being in a cave,

35:43.542 --> 35:47.546
you were out in the world,
except you couldn't see it.

35:53.185 --> 35:56.755
Because you weren't looking.

36:03.929 --> 36:06.031
Because you trusted
that the world you saw

36:06.064 --> 36:10.068
through the prism
was the real world.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.388
But there's a difference.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.392
You see, unlike
the allegory of the cave,

36:33.425 --> 36:36.362
where the people are real
and the shadows are false...

36:39.231 --> 36:41.367
...here other people
are the shadows.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.203
Their faces. Their lives.

36:45.237 --> 36:48.874
This is the delusion
of the narcissist,

36:48.907 --> 36:51.277
who believes that
they alone are real.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.960
Their feelings are
the only feelings that matter

37:08.994 --> 37:12.130
because other people
are just shadows,

37:12.163 --> 37:13.932
and shadows don't feel.

37:17.303 --> 37:19.271
Because they're not real.

37:29.648 --> 37:33.619
But what if everyone
lived in caves?

37:41.026 --> 37:43.429
Then no one would be real.

37:43.462 --> 37:46.932
Not even you.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.237
Unless one day you woke up

37:52.270 --> 37:55.273
and left the cave.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.409
How strange the world
would look

37:57.443 --> 38:00.846
after a lifetime
of staring at shadows.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.143
Let's get inside!

39:32.771 --> 39:34.406
DAVID:
They're...

39:34.440 --> 39:36.842
Us.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.343
DAVID:
Let's get inside!

39:53.659 --> 39:56.061
They're...

39:56.094 --> 39:57.996
Us.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.412
I wonder what happened to them--

40:14.446 --> 40:18.950
us... out here.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.987
Nothing good.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.492
This place.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.362
Some kind
of geographic disorder.

40:33.799 --> 40:34.966
Is that a thing?

40:35.000 --> 40:39.004
A crossroad of possibilities.

40:46.344 --> 40:49.147
When this is over,
we'll go home.

40:49.180 --> 40:52.350
Home

40:52.383 --> 40:54.352
We'll get a place.

40:54.385 --> 40:58.023
In the country. Quiet.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.658
Grow old there.

40:59.691 --> 41:03.261
And die, like them.

41:03.294 --> 41:07.198
Every story ends the same.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.468
I don't believe that.

41:10.502 --> 41:12.203
Hmm.

41:13.338 --> 41:16.074
Hmm, that's sweet.

41:19.477 --> 41:23.281
Do something for me.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.884
Anything.

41:25.917 --> 41:29.988
When the time comes,
prove me wrong.

41:48.106 --> 41:50.709
You better have a plan.

42:13.031 --> 42:17.535
DAVID :
Find the clock.

42:17.569 --> 42:19.470
Of the Long Now.

42:32.584 --> 42:35.053
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

42:42.894 --> 42:45.563
OLIVER :
Sunflower. Sunflower.

42:45.597 --> 42:47.498
Melanie.

42:51.603 --> 42:52.971
Sunflower.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.141
(man speaking backwards
over P.A.)

43:02.848 --> 43:04.783
Melanie.

43:10.455 --> 43:12.423
Melanie.

43:12.457 --> 43:16.327
-* My Bonnie lives
over the sea *
-Sunflower.

43:16.361 --> 43:19.530
-* My Bonnie lives
over the ocean *
-Sunflower.

43:20.966 --> 43:24.936
* So bring back
my Bonnie to me. *

43:24.970 --> 43:25.871
Melanie.

43:28.774 --> 43:30.341
It's done.

43:30.375 --> 43:32.978
She's ours.

43:33.011 --> 43:35.947
Mine.

43:35.981 --> 43:37.883
Ours.

43:50.195 --> 43:51.562
Come.

43:53.031 --> 43:54.632
Come.

46:24.015 --> 46:25.383
MAN:
Now I get it.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.293
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

46:37.195 --> 46:39.464
How are you feeling
since our last season?

46:39.497 --> 46:42.567
I need to remind you,
what you think is real...

46:43.568 --> 46:44.903
never occurred.

46:46.004 --> 46:48.006
It's all in your head.
