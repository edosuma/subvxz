00:07.423 --> 00:08.216
Hi!

00:08.217 --> 00:10.051
(SCREAMS)
(THUDDING)

00:11.302 --> 00:15.097
Sorry, my sweet.
Did I startle you?

00:15.098 --> 00:17.726
No, I screamed and
fell on my butt for fun!

00:19.435 --> 00:20.936
Zuri!
Why are you screaming?

00:20.937 --> 00:22.187
Hey, Jessie.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.608
Oh, Stuart.
Question retracted.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.818
Stuart, where have you been?

00:27.819 --> 00:30.613
You were supposed
to meet here
15 minutes ago.

00:30.614 --> 00:32.031
Forgive me.

00:32.031 --> 00:35.075
My monkey bar pants
were still in the dryer.

00:35.076 --> 00:38.288
I've heard a lot of
excuses from guys before,
but that one's a first.

00:39.497 --> 00:42.041
Stuart, I'm a busy woman.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.419
I scheduled monkey bars
from 9:00 to 9:15.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.505
Now I have to go groom my zebra.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.178
You know,
Zuri and I really seem
to be drifting apart.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.221
Were you ever together?

00:56.222 --> 01:00.184
Yes, if Photoshop counts.

01:00.185 --> 01:05.105
According to Channing Tatum's
lawyer, it does not.

01:05.105 --> 01:08.483
Look, Stuart, the truth is,
relationships are hard work.

01:08.484 --> 01:10.278
Zuri said we're in
a relationship?

01:10.904 --> 01:11.905
(SPRAYS)

01:14.074 --> 01:15.908
Friendships are hard work.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.745
Sometimes you have to make
an extra effort to carve out
time for each other.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.496
You're right, Jessie.

01:21.497 --> 01:24.416
I'll make more time
for Zuri by reducing
my piccolo practice

01:24.417 --> 01:27.086
from two hours a day
to one hour.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.088
Oh, Stuart...

01:30.006 --> 01:31.966
If you want any girl to
spend time with you,

01:31.967 --> 01:34.094
cut down piccolo practice
to zero hours.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.887
Then pick up a guitar.

01:36.888 --> 01:37.973
And some weights.

02:37.699 --> 02:38.909
Guess who doesn't care.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.246
Oh, so you don't care
about a certain TV show

02:44.247 --> 02:45.998
about a wealthy
aristocratic family

02:45.999 --> 02:48.239
and their servants in a
turn-of-the-century
Boston estate?

02:49.460 --> 02:50.961
BOTH: Worthington Manor?

02:50.962 --> 02:52.922
That's our favorite show!

02:52.923 --> 02:55.759
Congratulations, Jessie!
You'll be great
playing a servant.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.220
What makes you think
I'm auditioning
to play a servant?

03:00.221 --> 03:03.223
Because you're a servant.

03:03.224 --> 03:06.101
I am an actor.
I can be anything.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.938
In that case, can you be
"good at acting?"

03:09.022 --> 03:11.065
Because if you get this part,

03:11.066 --> 03:14.651
then Emma and I can go
to set with you and meet all
of our favorite actors!

03:14.652 --> 03:16.111
And we can help you prepare.

03:16.112 --> 03:18.113
We're Worthington Manor experts.

03:18.114 --> 03:21.491
I was actually president
of the Worthington Manor
Fan Club.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.911
Until I was overthrown
in a coup d'etat.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.289
I had to do it!
You were a tyrant!

03:28.458 --> 03:30.459
Okay.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.920
Well, I will take
all the help I can get.

03:32.921 --> 03:36.216
I'm auditioning for the role
of a socialite heiress
who visits the estate.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.009
You're gonna play an heiress?

03:39.010 --> 03:41.553
Do you think you can
pull off that level
of sophistication?

03:41.554 --> 03:42.723
Sure, why not?

03:45.558 --> 03:46.768
(MUFFLED) You want some?

03:47.894 --> 03:49.896
I hope she means from the can.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.027
Okay, Stuart,
for doing my homework,

03:57.028 --> 03:59.571
you get an hour of Zuri time.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.991
Don't waste it.

04:01.992 --> 04:06.996
Your eyes sparkle brighter
than the sequins
on my band uniform.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.874
Fifty-nine minutes
and counting.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.167
(GRUNTS)

04:12.168 --> 04:16.505
Luke, I beg your pardon,
but the terrace is reserved
for Zuri and me.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.507
Yeah, pretty sure
you can't do that.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.301
Plus, Jessie sent me out here.

04:21.302 --> 04:24.096
She says I'm spending
too much time inside
playing video games.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.598
So...

04:26.599 --> 04:28.976
(LASERS FIRING IN GAME)

04:28.977 --> 04:32.813
Luke!
Prepare for a thrashing!

04:32.814 --> 04:37.192
Ugh! With these two nitwits,
I can't concentrate
on the game.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.236
Oh, honey, you roll dice

04:39.237 --> 04:43.073
and move the game piece
a corresponding
amount of spaces.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.326
It doesn't require
a lot of concentration.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.455
And yet, I'm walking away.

04:54.335 --> 04:59.298
What do you Neanderthals
not understand about
a red velvet rope?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.300
(GRUNTS)

05:01.134 --> 05:03.760
(CLATTERING)

05:03.761 --> 05:08.640
Luke, the whole school
is talking about my crush
on Kylie Nicholson.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.392
I told you that in confidence!

05:10.393 --> 05:12.019
I didn't tell anybody,

05:12.020 --> 05:15.898
except Dave,
and Eric and Gossip Gary.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.067
Who knew it would get out?

05:18.651 --> 05:21.778
Ugh! You have
ruined my life!

05:21.779 --> 05:24.364
And I will have my revenge!

05:24.365 --> 05:27.953
I will tell the entire
school about your
embarrassing habit of...

05:29.120 --> 05:31.372
You know, how you...

05:32.248 --> 05:33.874
You got nothing.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.210
My life is an open book.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.463
Which is ironic,
since I don't like
to open books.

05:43.759 --> 05:47.471
You just had a baby,
why were you driving so fast?

05:47.472 --> 05:48.598
(SNIFFLING)

05:50.100 --> 05:51.976
(TURNS OFF THE TV)
BERTRAM: Ah.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.061
That wraps up Season 5
of Worthington Manor.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.312
(SNORING)

05:55.313 --> 05:56.689
Jessie!

05:58.233 --> 06:00.817
Isn't this helpful
for your audition?

06:00.818 --> 06:03.237
Not as helpful as getting
a good night's sleep.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.863
Well, if you don't get the part,

06:04.864 --> 06:07.075
you'll have plenty of time
to sleep on the streets.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.661
What?
I'll still be the nanny.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.332
I'll still have
a room here. Right?

06:16.167 --> 06:18.460
You have to know the show
to be on it.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.337
(SCOFFS) I think I know
the show by now.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.964
Oh, yeah?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.507
Then how did the Worthingtons
earn their fortune back

06:23.508 --> 06:25.800
after losing it
for the fifth time at
the end of Season 3?

06:25.801 --> 06:26.927
Huh?

06:26.928 --> 06:28.971
Uh, uh...

06:28.972 --> 06:33.308
Oh! That was when
Waldorf Worthington
got that huge settlement

06:33.309 --> 06:36.437
after tripping on
Henry Cabot's
crooked cobblestones.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.356
That was Season 2!

06:39.357 --> 06:41.567
You bring shame to
Worthington Manor!

06:44.404 --> 06:47.156
How do you two know
so much about the
Worthington Family,

06:47.157 --> 06:49.408
yet neither of you
could tell me
Ravi's middle name?

06:49.409 --> 06:51.076
He has a middle name?

06:51.077 --> 06:52.198
(WHISPERS)
Which one is Ravi?

06:54.705 --> 06:56.290
What's so great about
the Worthingtons anyway?

06:56.291 --> 06:57.958
They can't even
dress themselves.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.834
Back then,
the rich were pampered.

06:59.835 --> 07:01.753
Not like today.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.755
Says the girl
I take to dance class
in a helicopter.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.470
Stuart, what are we doing here?

07:10.471 --> 07:12.515
I want to be alone
with you, my sweet.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.685
So we can finally

07:16.644 --> 07:18.021
finish our board game!

07:19.897 --> 07:23.150
Stuart, the panic room
is for emergencies,

07:23.151 --> 07:27.029
like for us to hide in
if someone breaks into
the penthouse.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.324
Or Jessie tries to
make me do chores.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.409
But this is an emergency!

07:32.410 --> 07:33.953
We need to bond!

07:33.954 --> 07:35.455
I'm a lonely little guy!

07:36.414 --> 07:38.332
And it's gonna stay that way.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.001
(BEEPING)

07:40.585 --> 07:41.961
(BUZZING)

07:41.962 --> 07:43.754
The exit code is not working!

07:44.672 --> 07:46.173
On the bright side,

07:46.174 --> 07:49.259
that gives us
plenty of time to
finish our game!

07:49.260 --> 07:53.722
Stuart! We are trapped
without any food or water!

07:53.723 --> 07:57.143
And I do not want
to be found next to a skeleton
in a sweater vest!

08:02.857 --> 08:04.941
Stuart, what are we gonna do?

08:04.942 --> 08:06.987
Enjoy our time together?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.991
Remove your arm
from my shoulder,

08:11.992 --> 08:14.660
or you'll be removing
these dice from your colon!

08:16.496 --> 08:19.624
RAVI: Could you please
keep it down?
We are trying to meditate!

08:20.166 --> 08:21.167
Ravi?

08:24.837 --> 08:26.380
(GROWLING)

08:26.381 --> 08:27.964
What are you doing in here?

08:27.965 --> 08:30.384
This is where I come
when I need some
peace and quiet

08:30.385 --> 08:33.221
to center myself
after Luke has ruined
my life.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.515
I am in here a lot.

08:37.308 --> 08:40.559
Well, I'm glad you like it,
because we're trapped!

08:40.561 --> 08:42.437
What? Nonsense.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.649
You probably just
entered the code wrong.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.360
(BEEPING)
(BUZZES)

08:47.985 --> 08:49.986
Oh, dear.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.405
By the quickening of my pulse,

08:51.406 --> 08:54.574
I am beginning to see
why this is called a
"panic room."

08:54.575 --> 08:56.826
Now give me room to panic!

08:56.827 --> 08:58.079
(SCREAMING)

09:01.291 --> 09:05.086
I'm auditioning for
the role of an heiress,
not a bookshelf!

09:06.546 --> 09:09.089
Heiresses have great posture.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.091
You look like
you're auditioning
for the letter "S."

09:14.470 --> 09:17.265
Tea is served,
as you requested, milady.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.267
How delightful.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.018
Thank you, Bertram.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.688
Mmm. Don't mind if I do.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.149
Ow!

09:27.150 --> 09:29.025
Do it like on Worthington Manor!

09:29.026 --> 09:31.946
I wanted to be the one
to smack you,
but Emma won the coin toss.

09:35.866 --> 09:37.576
Ow!
Again!

09:37.577 --> 09:39.286
You must hold the saucer,

09:39.287 --> 09:42.790
then lift the tea cup
by the handle,
with your pinkie out.

09:48.045 --> 09:51.091
It's like watching
a monkey using tools
for the first time.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.802
This is terrible!

09:55.803 --> 09:57.929
It could be days before
someone comes in here!

09:57.930 --> 09:59.181
Hey, guys.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.016
Luke! Do not let
the door close

10:02.810 --> 10:03.978
behind you.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.981
What are you guys doing in here?

10:07.982 --> 10:08.983
Bowling.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.112
Why did you come in here, Luke?

10:13.113 --> 10:18.032
Oh, well, you see.
I was looking for you guys.

10:18.033 --> 10:19.118
(CHUCKLES)

10:19.119 --> 10:20.661
Because I missed you.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.389
And why do you keep on
looking over there?

10:26.792 --> 10:30.086
What shameful thing
are you hiding
in that trunk?

10:30.087 --> 10:31.380
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
It's nothing.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.382
Whoa!

10:34.967 --> 10:36.676
An accordion?

10:36.677 --> 10:38.970
This is almost too easy.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.432
The accordion happens to be
very a noble instrument.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.685
It makes beautiful music
by expelling air.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.312
Like I do.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.233
I am telling the whole school!

10:51.234 --> 10:53.902
Even band geeks will
throw you in a locker!

10:53.903 --> 10:55.987
(LAUGHS)

10:55.988 --> 10:59.616
The accordion is
the pocket protector
of instruments.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.119
And that's coming from a guy
who rocks the piccolo.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.709
Okay, this is my
big emotional scene.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.921
Katherine Mansford
confesses her feelings for the
butler of Worthington Manor,

11:12.922 --> 11:13.922
but knows her
father will never...

11:13.923 --> 11:15.675
La-la-la-la-la-la-la!

11:16.926 --> 11:19.511
I don't want any more spoilers.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.638
Call if Jessie needs
to be hit with
the ruler again.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.266
That was fun.

11:24.267 --> 11:27.644
Remember,
your character is part of
the upper-class elite,

11:27.645 --> 11:29.813
and I am playing
the lowly butler.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.524
You must resist the urge
to love me.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.235
Not exactly an acting challenge.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.907
Hey, Ravi, shouldn't
this cable plugged in
to the monitor?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.451
Actually, yes.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.160
Way to nerd out, Luke.

11:44.161 --> 11:47.872
First, the accordion,
now audio-visual expertise...

11:47.873 --> 11:50.626
When does your
Civil War Reenactment
Club meet?

11:54.964 --> 11:56.215
Ravi, you fixed it!

12:00.636 --> 12:03.597
JESSIE: Can this really
be happening?
What will people think?

12:03.598 --> 12:05.557
I don't care what
the world thinks!

12:05.558 --> 12:07.851
All that matters is
what you think.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.769
JESSIE: I think you are
the sweetest,

12:09.770 --> 12:12.731
kindest, most wonderful man
I've ever met.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.024
But alas, we must
fight these feelings.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.111
Don't fight them, embrace them.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.864
Please, I'm just a butler,

12:20.865 --> 12:24.327
sitting in front of a girl,
asking her to love him.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.913
No. Way.

12:30.249 --> 12:34.085
And I'm just a girl
telling a butler,
"I love you!"

12:34.086 --> 12:36.087
No!

12:36.088 --> 12:38.089
(SOBBING)

12:38.090 --> 12:39.173
Jessie and...

12:39.174 --> 12:40.467
Bertram?

12:40.468 --> 12:42.303
I guess love is in the air.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.140
I want to shout it
from the rooftops.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.422
I love you!
I love you! I love you!
I love you! I love you!

12:50.895 --> 12:53.063
Turn it off!
Turn it off!

12:54.815 --> 12:56.942
Shall we cement our love

12:57.527 --> 12:58.819
with a kiss?

13:00.696 --> 13:02.572
You got it!
Let's stop there!

13:02.573 --> 13:03.657
Okay.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.158
Great.
Way to go.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.828
Well, (CHUCKLES)
I can't believe I'm saying
this, but you were

13:08.829 --> 13:10.038
great.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.040
I might actually get this part!

13:12.041 --> 13:16.044
And more importantly,
I might get to meet
the Worthingtons!

13:16.045 --> 13:19.923
It's amazing how much
you can get done when you
don't have any distractions.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.007
Hey!

13:21.008 --> 13:23.009
Where are all the distractions?

13:23.010 --> 13:26.346
Now that I think of it,
I haven't seen Luke, Ravi,
or Zuri in hours.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.015
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

13:33.270 --> 13:36.356
Okay, I have connected
this switch
from the control panel

13:36.357 --> 13:38.483
into the penthouse
electrical system.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.319
Now, I can signal Jessie
using Morse Code.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.029
You know Morse Code?

13:43.030 --> 13:45.783
Of course! It is my favorite
of all the codes.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.952
Why Bertram?

13:48.953 --> 13:50.495
(SOBBING)

13:50.496 --> 13:52.789
He's cranky and bald,

13:52.790 --> 13:57.126
and dances like an
electrocuted walrus.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.504
(SOBBING CONTINUES)

13:59.380 --> 14:00.798
Why, Jessie?

14:02.174 --> 14:03.342
Why?

14:07.930 --> 14:10.432
Listen, if you're turning
lights off,
can you start in here?

14:10.433 --> 14:12.727
I cannot watch this
train wreck anymore.

14:17.231 --> 14:20.359
Guys! Where are you?

14:20.360 --> 14:23.404
Really? Sell the helicopter
and pay your electric bill,
people!

14:25.615 --> 14:27.241
Wait, that's Morse Code!

14:29.869 --> 14:30.870
S...

14:31.621 --> 14:33.497
O...

14:33.498 --> 14:36.083
S... It must be Ravi!
It's his favorite
of all the codes.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.545
(DOOR BEEPS)

14:40.546 --> 14:42.005
Ravi?

14:42.006 --> 14:45.008
Jessie, thank goodness!
Hold the door open.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.010
What are you guys
doing in here?
Hiding from Stuart?

14:48.095 --> 14:51.014
Uh, I mean... Uh...

14:51.015 --> 14:52.517
I got nothing.
Sorry, Stuart.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.521
He's fine.
The kid's got thick skin.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.938
Let's just get out of here!

14:58.939 --> 15:01.190
Luke, no!
What in the blazes...

15:01.191 --> 15:03.026
No one's leaving.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.987
Not until Jessie gets over
being in love with Bertram!

15:05.988 --> 15:08.698
What? I am not in love
with Bertram. And frankly,

15:08.699 --> 15:11.452
I'm really hurt that
you think my dating life
has come to that.

15:13.788 --> 15:17.373
Then what was that
little scene we saw
on the cameras?

15:17.374 --> 15:19.793
A little scene!
For my audition tonight!

15:19.794 --> 15:21.462
Oh, like you would
get an audition!

15:23.213 --> 15:24.673
Thanks a lot, Luke.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.883
Now we are all going
to die in here!

15:26.884 --> 15:28.678
We're not locked in here.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.930
(BEEPS)

15:31.931 --> 15:34.307
(BUZZES)
We're locked in here!

15:34.308 --> 15:37.101
Luke, this just went
from being the panic room

15:37.102 --> 15:39.228
to being the
"I'm gonna kick
your butt" room!

15:39.229 --> 15:40.648
Guys!

15:41.023 --> 15:42.398
Calm down.

15:42.399 --> 15:45.652
The truth is, we're not trapped.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.947
I changed the exit code
so Zuri and I could
be together.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.574
Whoa, that's desperate.

15:50.575 --> 15:51.992
You make Ravi
look like a player.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.538
It's Jessie's fault!

15:56.539 --> 15:59.666
She said I should
carve out alone time
with you.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.168
You told him to trap me in here?

16:02.169 --> 16:05.589
Not at all! I had no
idea Stuart would take it
this far.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.424
He takes everything this far!

16:09.802 --> 16:12.262
As they say, go big or go home.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.349
In that case, just go home!

16:16.350 --> 16:18.434
This relationship is over!

16:18.435 --> 16:19.895
I knew it was a relationship!

16:23.065 --> 16:25.943
You are out of your mind!
Let us out!

16:27.319 --> 16:28.778
Fine.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.531
The new code is in my pocket.

16:35.703 --> 16:36.995
Uh-oh.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.412
Let me guess.

16:38.413 --> 16:40.666
You forgot to put the code
in your panic room pants.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.507
I cannot miss this audition!

16:48.508 --> 16:51.511
Just because we might
die in here, doesn't
mean my career has to!

16:53.554 --> 16:55.930
Meanwhile, I am starving!
(GROWLING)

16:55.931 --> 16:58.224
I'm so hungry,

16:58.225 --> 17:01.060
even Mrs. Kipling is
starting to look good.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.395
(GROWLING)

17:02.396 --> 17:03.564
(SIZZLING)

17:05.691 --> 17:09.778
You just better hope
you do not start looking
good to Mrs. Kipling.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.613
(GROWLING)

17:11.614 --> 17:13.365
Is that why she's staring at me?

17:16.076 --> 17:17.703
(GROWLING)

17:20.079 --> 17:23.332
Jessie seems to
have disappeared!
I'm really worried!

17:23.333 --> 17:24.542
Me too!

17:24.544 --> 17:26.211
Now, we'll never get
to Worthington Manor.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.965
Emma, if we can't find her,
you're going to have to
audition in her place.

17:30.966 --> 17:34.052
Do you think you can
play a wealthy,
demanding heiress?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.845
I can try.

17:35.846 --> 17:38.014
First, make me a sandwich.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.141
Worthington Manor, here I come.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.019
Seriously,
quick with the sandwich.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.942
Jessie, we have a question.

17:48.943 --> 17:53.071
If we're all going
to die in here,
but I strangle Stuart,

17:53.072 --> 17:54.907
is that still murder?

17:57.326 --> 18:00.662
Don't talk like that Zuri.
We're going to
get out of here.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.121
Do you really believe that?

18:02.122 --> 18:04.833
No, I'm just trying
to buy you some time.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.501
I cannot believe
I am going to
perish in here

18:07.502 --> 18:12.256
before I get my chance to
humiliate Luke in front of
the whole school.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.800
Why would you do that?

18:13.801 --> 18:16.595
I mean,
I'm sure he deserves it,
but why?

18:16.596 --> 18:20.556
(SIGHS) I told Luke about
my secret crush on
Kylie Nicholson,

18:20.557 --> 18:22.350
and he spilled the beans.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.644
Now, it is payback time.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.771
What? Brothers don't
pay each other back.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.566
No kidding. Luke has
owed me $10 since May.

18:31.902 --> 18:35.321
I mean family is supposed
to keep each other's secrets,

18:35.322 --> 18:37.531
not use them as ammunition.

18:37.532 --> 18:39.242
You are right.

18:39.243 --> 18:42.454
Luke, before we all
become lizard kibble,

18:43.538 --> 18:45.581
I want you to know

18:45.582 --> 18:47.917
I am sorry I threatened
to tell everyone
you play the accordion.

18:47.918 --> 18:52.130
(GASPS) Luke plays
the accordion?
Nerd alert!

18:52.131 --> 18:55.175
(CLEARS THROAT) I mean, Luke,
do you have something
you'd like to say to Ravi?

18:56.719 --> 19:00.764
Ravi, I'm so sorry
I betrayed your trust.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.475
From now on,
if you tell me a secret,
it stays a secret.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.187
Aw, that's so sweet.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.023
You two made up.

19:10.024 --> 19:12.151
But we're still stuck
in the panic room!

19:14.444 --> 19:16.988
Hey, why is the
living room monitor off?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.865
You were professing
your love for Bertram,

19:18.866 --> 19:21.368
so it was either that
or gouge my own eyes out.

19:24.121 --> 19:27.832
So, Katherine,
I guess you chose your
father's money over me.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.960
You're still just a
scared little girl.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.253
Maybe I am.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.423
But you are just
the butler of
Worthington Manor.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.383
And you always will be.

19:37.384 --> 19:40.095
No. Way.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.849
Emma, you were great!

19:44.850 --> 19:46.350
Thanks.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.853
But I still think
I'm way too young
to audition for this part.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.064
It was New England in 1902.

19:51.065 --> 19:53.734
People died at 30.
You're practically
middle-aged.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.570
You are not getting
my part, Emma!

19:57.571 --> 20:00.908
I have worked too hard
and raised my pinkie
too high to quit now!

20:03.368 --> 20:05.955
That monitor is tearing
this family apart.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.084
Okay, I'm breaking
us out of here.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.668
Just like Olivia Worthington

20:12.669 --> 20:15.463
broke out of the
collapsed diamond mine
in the end of Episode 12.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.966
What is she talking about?

20:18.258 --> 20:20.551
Worthington Manor.
Great show.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.136
But it was Episode 13.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.805
(MOCKINGLY)
"But it was Episode 13."

20:23.806 --> 20:25.890
I am getting to that audition!

20:25.891 --> 20:27.017
(DOOR BEEPS)
(SCREAMING)

20:28.102 --> 20:29.561
(THUDS)

20:30.896 --> 20:32.606
In an ambulance.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.649
I found Jessie!

20:36.651 --> 20:39.612
I can't believe she
broke through
a solid steel door.

20:39.613 --> 20:42.615
Actually, I managed
to cut the power
to the electronic lock

20:42.616 --> 20:44.283
just as she made contact.

20:44.284 --> 20:45.535
(JESSIE GROANS)

20:46.495 --> 20:47.747
You are welcome.

20:52.042 --> 20:55.503
Zuri, I'm really sorry
I locked you in here.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.882
I'll just go home,
and leave you
alone forever.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.009
Stuart, wait.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.719
I may have said
a few things I didn't mean.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.096
Like how I'm out of my mind?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.932
No, that's pretty spot on.

21:08.642 --> 21:12.021
But, since you worship me,
I guess we can
finish the game.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.856
You mean it?

21:14.857 --> 21:15.983
Absolutely.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.067
Where are the dice?

21:18.068 --> 21:19.388
(MRS. KIPLING BURPS)
(SPLATTERING)

21:23.032 --> 21:25.658
Hey, the lizard just
rolled snake eyes!

21:25.659 --> 21:26.660
(BOTH LAUGHING)

21:30.664 --> 21:32.165
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

21:32.166 --> 21:35.126
(GASPS) How was
your audition?
Did we get the part?

21:35.127 --> 21:37.838
Please tell me
you used better posture
than you have right now.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.673
My posture was perfect,

21:40.674 --> 21:44.718
but they didn't hire me
because they had a
problem with my pinkies.

21:44.719 --> 21:46.429
Did you forget to hold them out?

21:46.430 --> 21:47.890
No, they were out.

21:49.224 --> 21:50.225
Way out.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.728
(ALL SOBBING)

21:56.773 --> 22:00.193
I'm telling you,
this is not the way to
impress Kylie Nicholson.

22:00.194 --> 22:01.903
How about I tell her
you're a super hero?

22:01.904 --> 22:03.112
No.
A super villain?

22:03.113 --> 22:04.405
No.
Got your third
chest hair?

22:04.406 --> 22:05.866
In my dreams!
But, no.

22:09.829 --> 22:13.289
Kylie, prepare to be serenaded!

22:13.290 --> 22:14.457
Hit it, Luke.

I am on the verge of my
third chest hair!
