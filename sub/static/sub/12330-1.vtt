00:18.710 --> 00:21.010
Some fairy tales are true.

00:21.080 --> 00:25.040
Most other stories we make up
to help us deal with real life.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.450
It all depends
on your point of view,

00:27.520 --> 00:29.820
but here are the facts.

00:29.890 --> 00:33.020
There was once a princess
who lived in a castle

00:33.090 --> 00:36.220
high above the streets
of an enchanted kingdom.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.700
The king and queen
were long gone,

00:38.770 --> 00:40.790
but they left her
with their treasure

00:40.870 --> 00:43.900
so that she could stay
a princess forever.

00:43.970 --> 00:46.670
On the eve
of her 22nd birthday,

00:46.740 --> 00:49.230
a great celebration
was planned.

00:51.250 --> 00:54.110
Molly's machine.
Speak your piece.

00:54.620 --> 00:58.420
Oh, birthday girl,
pick up, pick up, pick up.

00:58.490 --> 01:01.220
Huey and I
are just sitting here waiting.

01:01.290 --> 01:04.379
You better be on your way.
- Money down she's still asleep.

01:04.459 --> 01:06.480
Molly, wake up!

01:08.560 --> 01:11.400
Molly's machine.
Speak your piece.

01:11.470 --> 01:13.660
Hey, Molly, it's Justin here.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.930
Callin' from the studio
to wish you a happy birthday...

01:17.010 --> 01:20.460
Give me five more minutes,
baby, and I'll rock your world.

01:20.540 --> 01:21.910
Love ya!

02:32.950 --> 02:36.680
You can't turn the hallway
into a greenhouse, Miss Gunn.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.740
Good evening, Mr. McConkey,

02:38.820 --> 02:41.050
Please say hello
to your wife for me.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.680
Bye. Have a nice night!

02:43.760 --> 02:46.750
I've alerted the management
company about this.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.200
Oh, my.

02:59.210 --> 03:02.510
I put the flowers upstairs for you,
but this is out of hand.

03:02.580 --> 03:03.910
Got a girl, Tony?

03:04.910 --> 03:07.070
Not one that could fit
into this dental floss.

03:07.150 --> 03:10.050
Be a darling and send all this stuff
to the Salvation Army!

03:10.120 --> 03:12.140
You're the greatest, Tony!

03:31.740 --> 03:34.300
Molly?
- Hey, Ingrid, it's me.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.040
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm sorry, I passed out.

03:37.110 --> 03:40.310
I was watching TV.
- That was a premeditated nap.

03:40.380 --> 03:42.370
You did this to me on purpose.

03:42.450 --> 03:44.610
You're my best friend
in the whole universe.

03:44.690 --> 03:46.750
How could you possibly think
a thing like this?

03:46.820 --> 03:49.020
It's like stabbing me in the heart.
Thank you!

03:49.090 --> 03:50.490
Forget it, okay?

03:50.560 --> 03:53.080
I didn't want to tell you,
but our little night out has grown.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.490
Huey and I are here
with a few of your closest friends

03:55.560 --> 03:57.550
waiting to wish you a...

03:58.900 --> 04:00.200
Happy birthday?

04:00.270 --> 04:01.360
Happy birthday.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.430
I tried calling you from home.

04:08.510 --> 04:10.700
The girly to end all girlies
is in the house.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.180
Happy birthday, Molly.

04:12.980 --> 04:14.920
We got you, Molly!
- We got you, didn't we?

04:14.980 --> 04:17.980
You did, I thought it was
gonna be just us guys going out.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.649
Hell, no! What kind of friends
you think we are?

04:20.720 --> 04:23.210
Look at this.
This here is a party, right?

04:25.590 --> 04:26.990
You're 22?

04:27.060 --> 04:29.930
I just turned 19
and I thought I'd kill myself.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.760
You look good, though.
Buy you a drink?

04:32.830 --> 04:33.990
No, thanks.

04:34.070 --> 04:37.730
I wanna connect the dots, baby.
Look at the babes, Molly,

04:37.810 --> 04:40.830
They're, like, beautiful
and natural and sexy, right?

04:40.910 --> 04:43.210
Beauty like that is universal.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.410
They really do look young, huh?

04:45.480 --> 04:48.110
The thing I love about women
is that you are willing

04:48.180 --> 04:50.840
to accept each other
for who you are.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.080
There you are, sweetie.

04:53.150 --> 04:55.950
You remember Julie and Holly
from the MOMA Junior Committee?

04:56.020 --> 04:59.290
Happy birthday.
I love your solid hair scrunchy.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.160
Thanks.
- Issey Miyake?

05:01.230 --> 05:02.960
Home Depot.

05:03.030 --> 05:07.870
You can get Botox injections
for that forehead wrinkle.

05:07.940 --> 05:11.560
Face Factory.
No appointment necessary.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.480
Why would I have
a worry wrinkle?

05:23.550 --> 05:25.950
Why would you think
anyone would care?

05:28.190 --> 05:29.880
Excuse me?

05:29.960 --> 05:33.690
I had shoes like yours once,
when I was five.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.530
That was what,
like three days ago?

05:41.600 --> 05:43.660
Try three years.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.760
Excuse me, Thumbelina,

05:45.840 --> 05:49.500
but you're still a little underage
to be clubbing, aren't you?

05:49.580 --> 05:52.810
You're a little overage to be
wearing a lampshade in your hair.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.850
Bright idea?

05:58.220 --> 06:00.410
You brought your own
personal soap?

06:01.020 --> 06:03.920
You want to pick up
bacterial meningitis or polio,

06:03.990 --> 06:05.980
you go ahead
and be my guest.

06:06.060 --> 06:08.050
Whatever diseases
you're already carrying

06:08.130 --> 06:10.650
probably make those
sound like a joke, anyway.

06:10.730 --> 06:14.170
There you are. I finally found
your little monster butt.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.330
Come here!

06:15.400 --> 06:17.740
I know you have trouble
reading something as simple

06:17.810 --> 06:21.300
as a sign on the door, Gooey Huey.
so let me help you,

06:21.380 --> 06:25.370
This is the ladies' room.

06:25.450 --> 06:28.140
Really? What's your excuse?
- Give me my purse.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.780
My boss' kid.
They can't keep a nanny.

06:30.850 --> 06:32.720
They fired their
third one this month today.

06:32.790 --> 06:35.150
She had dirty fingernails.
It was her or me.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.820
That hurts.
- Where's my purse?

06:36.890 --> 06:38.090
In my hand.

06:40.330 --> 06:42.630
Ing, am I hideous?
- What?

06:42.700 --> 06:45.600
As my best friend,
it is your duty not to lie to me.

06:45.670 --> 06:48.600
Please tell me,
am I turning into a hideous hag?

06:48.670 --> 06:50.970
You can have any guy here
with the snap of a finger.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.510
What's gotten into you?

07:00.380 --> 07:03.440
Oh, my God.

07:03.520 --> 07:06.250
Molly, let me show you something.
Come here,

07:06.320 --> 07:09.760
Sit down.
- Great, You again.

07:09.820 --> 07:12.160
I want to thank you all
for having me here.

07:12.230 --> 07:15.860
I've heard there's a birthday tonight.
Where's that birthday girl?

07:20.130 --> 07:23.500
All right.
This one's for you.

07:26.840 --> 07:30.500
The lights beam
down from the stars

07:30.580 --> 07:33.780
And it takes my breath away

07:33.850 --> 07:38.150
And the tears of glee
in my heart

07:38.220 --> 07:41.120
End up voicing words to say

07:41.190 --> 07:44.060
All I feel is invested in this...

07:44.130 --> 07:46.460
Oh, my God.
Who is that?

07:46.530 --> 07:48.360
That's my boy Neal Fox,

07:48.430 --> 07:50.620
I found him playing
at a dive in the Village.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.190
He's smokin'.

07:52.270 --> 07:54.260
Can I have him
for my birthday?

07:54.340 --> 07:57.570
No, Molly, I brought him here
so Roma could check him out.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.130
Besides, he's 100% girly free.

08:00.210 --> 08:03.910
He's celibate, like Morrissey.
He's all about the music.

08:03.980 --> 08:07.780
You wouldn't know real music
if Mozart hit you on the head.

08:07.850 --> 08:09.510
Quiet, the both of you.

08:09.580 --> 08:15.220
Quiet? This place is so loud,
it is giving me a migraine.

08:15.290 --> 08:17.350
My call of love

08:17.430 --> 08:21.380
Then she'll rise with love...

08:21.460 --> 08:22.620
Mom!

08:22.700 --> 08:25.430
No, your mom's over there
talkin' to my man Nas.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.660
We been tryin'
to sign him for months.

08:27.740 --> 08:31.800
Could you please keep it down?
- Mom, I wanna go home now!

08:40.820 --> 08:42.280
Night, Molls.
- Bye.

08:42.350 --> 08:43.980
Good night, Molly!
- Bye!

08:44.049 --> 08:49.080
I finished my new record and...
- That's great, Duncan.

08:49.160 --> 08:52.090
Nice to see you. Where is he?
- ... give me your two cents.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.420
Huey said this guy
is practically a monk.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.660
What the hell
are you trying to prove?

08:59.500 --> 09:03.030
The only reason you're looking
at this guy is because you can't have him.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.660
He's a rock 'n' roll
poet sex god.

09:05.740 --> 09:07.730
You'll toss him in a week.

09:07.810 --> 09:11.370
No, Ing, this one's different.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.210
I can feel it.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.680
That was good.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.080
Kid, I haven't heard
blue-eyed soul like that

09:17.150 --> 09:19.450
since Jeff Buckley's record.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.180
See what I'm sayin'?

09:21.260 --> 09:23.490
What did I tell you, Roma?
He's smokin', right?

09:23.560 --> 09:25.890
You did good, Huey.
- I need eight hours, Mom.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.490
If I don't get eight hours,
my immune system crashes,

09:28.560 --> 09:31.050
Record something more up-tempo
I can get on the radio.

09:31.130 --> 09:33.120
Let's go.
- Work it out with Huey.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.430
Go...

09:35.200 --> 09:37.190
That's what I'm talkin' about.
She gets it.

09:37.270 --> 09:39.260
I get it.
You don't get it.

09:39.340 --> 09:41.640
Wait...
- Neal, you need to get it.

09:41.710 --> 09:43.700
I think we got ourselves
a Grammy!

09:46.610 --> 09:48.100
I hate that...

09:48.180 --> 09:51.020
Kids! Always hogging
your attention.

09:51.790 --> 09:54.220
Hi.
- Hi, Birthday girl.

09:54.290 --> 09:56.550
Yeah, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

09:56.620 --> 09:58.620
Is this demo thing for real?

09:58.690 --> 10:01.690
She's about to sign you!
I can feel it in my bones.

10:01.760 --> 10:05.060
Rocket to the moon, baby.
Rocket to the moon.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.660
Oh, my.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.310
Are you really
Tommy Gunn's daughter?

10:17.210 --> 10:18.510
Seriously?

10:20.350 --> 10:22.440
Can you hold my purse, please?

10:22.520 --> 10:24.070
Yeah.
- Thanks.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.550
Jesus!

10:36.030 --> 10:38.620
I guess there is
a certain family resemblance.

10:38.700 --> 10:41.430
His guitars are in there?
- You wanna come see?

10:41.500 --> 10:42.490
Yeah.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.440
Can you just wait here
just one second, please?

10:52.510 --> 10:53.880
Thank you.
- Yeah.

11:18.910 --> 11:19.900
Right.

11:19.970 --> 11:23.570
Welcome
to Le Château Chez Molly.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.010
Nice.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.690
What on God's earth is that?

11:35.760 --> 11:37.780
Mu.
- Don't you mean oink?

11:37.860 --> 11:40.590
No, "Mu" means "pork" in Thai.

11:40.660 --> 11:43.490
He was going to be my curry diner
one night in Bangkok,

11:43.560 --> 11:45.500
but we fell in love.

11:45.570 --> 11:47.800
If you wait here,

11:47.870 --> 11:51.270
I will fix us some
bonbonnières confiseries.

11:54.610 --> 11:57.740
Oh, my God.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.650
Looks like you found it
on your own.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.050
I can't believe it!

12:05.750 --> 12:07.240
This is it.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.980
This is the acoustic Muddy Waters
gave Tommy Gunn.

12:11.060 --> 12:13.820
He played it at Budokan.
- Summer of '88.

12:13.890 --> 12:15.730
Daddy's little girl

12:15.800 --> 12:16.920
That's you.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.690
Paints the world
with her magic wand

12:19.770 --> 12:21.430
Please don't sing that song.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.200
"Molly Smiles."
He opened the show with it.

12:24.270 --> 12:26.430
For me

12:26.510 --> 12:29.170
And then he
and my mom died.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.470
Listen, I didn't mean to...

12:36.550 --> 12:39.140
Okay. Yeah.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.820
So what's next?

12:47.390 --> 12:49.260
How about dessert?

12:51.500 --> 12:53.330
Am I gonna be able
to pronounce it?

12:53.400 --> 12:54.730
I don't know.

12:55.840 --> 12:59.170
Can you say..."Pez"?

13:00.510 --> 13:03.030
I'm just not supposed
to act impulsively, you know?

13:03.110 --> 13:05.510
Part of my whole sobriety thing.

13:05.580 --> 13:08.340
Made a vow,
haven't broken it yet.

13:09.550 --> 13:11.020
Pez.

13:13.750 --> 13:16.590
I haven't had a drink
in 224 days.

13:18.490 --> 13:22.120
I'm also not supposed to have
romantic relationships my first year.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.530
Pez.

13:28.470 --> 13:31.170
It's called
the Law of Contrary Behavior.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.730
If I want a drink,
I don't have one.

13:33.810 --> 13:37.010
If I want to skip a gig,
I force myself to go.

13:37.080 --> 13:40.600
If I meet a girl
and I want her to come over...

13:41.550 --> 13:43.350
I send her home.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.140
Pez.

13:56.060 --> 13:58.260
Those are vows
I haven't broken.

14:10.480 --> 14:15.410
Ships crossing like ghosts
in the night

14:15.480 --> 14:19.710
Night names,
unremembered faces in sight

14:19.790 --> 14:24.720
Took what we can
in need to survive

14:26.390 --> 14:29.060
Oh, my God, I love it!

14:29.130 --> 14:31.190
It's the most
lyrically advanced thing I've done.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.500
No, purple means
rock 'n' roll royalty,

14:33.570 --> 14:36.060
and it picks up
the highlights in your eyes.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.430
You're too hot for those
earth tones you've been wearing.

14:40.510 --> 14:44.070
What about the song?
Is it too fast, too slow, what?

14:44.140 --> 14:50.570
It's kind of like the same thing
over and over again.

14:50.650 --> 14:54.310
Is there, like, a hook
or a good chorus or something?

14:54.390 --> 14:55.880
A hook?
- Yeah.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.450
I don't do hooks.
- Okay.

14:59.090 --> 15:01.620
I'm not a sell-out. I don't
wear purple and I don't do hooks.

15:01.700 --> 15:05.060
I said okay, okay?

15:08.440 --> 15:13.810
Names... names unremembered,
faces in sight

15:23.380 --> 15:25.380
Molly, I thought you were dead.

15:25.450 --> 15:28.850
Neal's in the other room.
- That guy is still there?

15:28.920 --> 15:31.790
You always do this.
When are you gonna grow up?

15:31.860 --> 15:33.850
He's never going to leave.

15:33.930 --> 15:37.230
All he does is mope
and play these loser songs.

15:38.470 --> 15:39.800
Help me, please.

15:39.870 --> 15:42.700
I don't know how to get rid of this guy
without breaking his heart.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.200
Hold.
Just a minute!

15:47.270 --> 15:50.140
Oh, my God,
I'm being totally suffocated.

15:52.750 --> 15:53.740
Yeah?

15:53.810 --> 15:56.840
Can you take those off?

15:57.850 --> 16:00.010
Ing, I'll call you.

16:02.290 --> 16:06.250
Baby... I'm not a love machine.

16:06.330 --> 16:08.820
No, my boxers...
can I have them back, please?

16:14.600 --> 16:15.590
Thanks.

16:16.540 --> 16:17.940
What's going on?

16:18.010 --> 16:21.370
Listen, I've got to go.
- Go?

16:22.740 --> 16:24.900
Go where, go?

16:24.980 --> 16:26.640
Home, Molly.

16:26.710 --> 16:29.650
The place where I live,
where I have a life,

16:29.720 --> 16:33.120
where I do my laundry,
get sleep, try to make music.

16:33.190 --> 16:35.090
Why can't you
make music here?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.150
This is a world gone mad,

16:37.220 --> 16:39.320
like I've stepped
through the looking-glass.

16:39.390 --> 16:42.120
There's a week's worth of leftovers,
a month of laundry.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.630
Look at this place.
- We'll call maid service.

16:44.700 --> 16:48.930
You call maid service.
I've got to rejoin the human race.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.200
No!

16:53.040 --> 16:54.200
I don't understand.

16:54.270 --> 16:58.440
Listen, I just feel
like I'm suffocating.

16:58.510 --> 17:01.500
I need some air.
- We can open the windows.

17:01.580 --> 17:05.250
It's not about the windows.
I need my shirt back.

17:07.650 --> 17:09.880
Damn! I forgot
to get new strings.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.390
I have, like,
five gigs this week

17:12.460 --> 17:15.359
and I have not done
a single thing.

17:15.430 --> 17:19.630
I have got to get to work.
I'll call you later, I swear.

17:31.380 --> 17:33.510
Oh, my God.

17:33.580 --> 17:36.070
This place is beyond
its normal grotesque.

17:36.150 --> 17:37.780
It's post-nuclear.

17:40.150 --> 17:42.780
Ninety-eight messages?

17:42.860 --> 17:46.120
Molly, your machine
has 98 messages on it.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.420
Write them down for me,
will you?

17:49.800 --> 17:53.430
He's gone.
I have no life.

17:56.870 --> 17:58.100
What?

17:58.170 --> 18:00.570
"Of course you have a life."

18:01.310 --> 18:03.300
"I don't need to tell you that."

18:03.380 --> 18:05.370
That's what you're
supposed to say to me.

18:05.450 --> 18:06.470
Sorry.

18:06.550 --> 18:10.070
As your best friend,
it's my duty not to lie to you.

18:10.150 --> 18:12.880
Besides,
you wanted him gone, remember?

18:12.950 --> 18:14.820
I did?

18:15.960 --> 18:17.790
What are all these
final notices?

18:17.860 --> 18:19.690
I'm gonna call him.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.990
I think now is
a good time to call him.

18:23.030 --> 18:25.400
Would you hand me the phone?
I'm gonna call him right now.

18:27.130 --> 18:29.860
Focus for one second.

18:29.940 --> 18:33.930
Your electric has been canceled
and so has your gas.

18:34.010 --> 18:36.070
Who pays your bills?

18:37.080 --> 18:38.310
Bob.

18:39.550 --> 18:40.980
Bob who?

18:41.050 --> 18:43.640
I don't know.
My parents' guy Bob.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.250
Your phone's dead.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.190
These rooms...

18:54.800 --> 18:58.820
sound so empty
without the sound of his music.

19:00.770 --> 19:03.460
Bob's number
has been disconnected.

19:04.470 --> 19:05.600
Oh, God.

19:05.670 --> 19:08.510
I'm sure it's little consolation,
but you're not the only one

19:08.580 --> 19:10.480
who got taken, Miss Gunn.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.240
Bob Kopalski had ten clients,

19:13.310 --> 19:16.940
assets equaling over $100 million,
when he disappeared.

19:17.020 --> 19:19.250
You're telling us
that none of it's insured?

19:19.320 --> 19:23.020
What a disaster.
Thank God for the residuals.

19:23.090 --> 19:28.080
Actually, Kopalski took such heavy
advances on the royalty income

19:28.160 --> 19:31.130
that by the time
the account recoups.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.460
Miss Gunn will be
on Social Security.

19:33.530 --> 19:36.440
Where does someone disappear
with $100 million?

19:36.500 --> 19:39.560
The best we can guess
is South America.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.130
Can't you just sue?

19:41.210 --> 19:45.010
My God,
how could he do this to her?

19:45.080 --> 19:48.610
He'll be back.
They always come back.

19:48.680 --> 19:52.170
If he does, he'll be looking
out the back of an FBI van

19:52.250 --> 19:54.480
on his way
to a long prison term.

19:54.560 --> 19:58.550
It'll be years
before you see a dime, if ever.

20:00.530 --> 20:05.060
Mr, Feldman, as a lawyer,

20:05.130 --> 20:07.400
may I please ask your advice

20:07.470 --> 20:12.960
as per what to do in the meantime
as far as, you know, money?

20:14.270 --> 20:15.830
Get a job?

20:18.450 --> 20:19.880
"Dear prospective employer,

20:20.210 --> 20:22.650
"although I've had
no previous employment, ever,

20:22.720 --> 20:24.950
"the following is a partial
but significant list

20:25.020 --> 20:28.950
of personal recommendations,
including contact information."

20:29.820 --> 20:32.550
The Dalai Lama, Tibet?

20:32.630 --> 20:35.960
900-thread count
Egyptian cotton.

20:36.730 --> 20:40.360
No man can resist
Egyptian cotton.

20:40.430 --> 20:43.340
Tibet is a country, Molly,
not contact information.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.890
Why not add "earth"

20:44.970 --> 20:47.170
in case someone
needs to know where Tibet is?

20:47.240 --> 20:48.970
This is not a résumé.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.310
It shows I'm a people person.

20:53.350 --> 20:54.840
Focus on the interview.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.910
Hello.
Pleasure to meet you.

20:56.980 --> 21:00.080
I will work overtime, weekends,
holidays, Yom Kippur, Christmas.

21:00.150 --> 21:03.250
You name it, I will be here.
- I'm sure that won't be necessary.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.690
Ingrid says you guys met
at Darlington?

21:05.760 --> 21:08.590
I was valedictorian there
two years in a row.

21:08.660 --> 21:10.960
That's so neat.

21:11.300 --> 21:14.430
Tell me, what is the price
on a set of these?

21:14.500 --> 21:17.560
$1,369 plus tax.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.940
You're in denial.
You're broke, remember?

21:21.010 --> 21:25.070
Trish, hon, tell me, do employees
get a discount around here?

21:25.150 --> 21:29.170
Ten percent, and some employees
are among our best customers.

21:32.020 --> 21:36.550
I'll take them.
Ing, this is the greatest job ever.

21:44.100 --> 21:47.330
Who is it?
- It's Molly!

21:47.400 --> 21:50.460
I was just out shopping
in the neighborhood.

21:50.540 --> 21:53.940
At midnight?
- It's the city that never sleeps.

21:57.740 --> 22:00.870
You can't do this.
I have to be at the studio at 9:00.

22:00.950 --> 22:03.680
I can't act like a kid anymore.
- Really?

22:03.750 --> 22:07.410
Neal, I haven't seen sheets
like this since the third grade.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.290
Rocket ships?

22:10.360 --> 22:13.760
You wouldn't have my jacket in there?
It's like my lucky jacket.

22:13.830 --> 22:17.260
I never get onstage without it.
I left it behind the other day.

22:17.330 --> 22:18.960
No.

22:19.030 --> 22:22.800
I guess you're gonna have to
come over and look for it.

22:22.870 --> 22:25.300
I can't disappear
from the world again.

22:25.370 --> 22:29.310
I can't lose myself in this obsessive-
compulsive irrational behavior.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.010
Feel.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.580
Excuse me?
- Feel.

22:40.850 --> 22:42.850
Egyptian cotton...

22:44.390 --> 22:46.880
900-thread count.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.750
All right, I'll tell you what.

22:50.830 --> 22:54.160
Maybe we can, like,
date, okay?

22:54.230 --> 22:55.220
Okay.

22:55.300 --> 23:00.070
But it's gonna have to be
a mature adult relationship with...

23:00.140 --> 23:02.840
alarm clocks in the morning...
- I love alarm clocks.

23:02.910 --> 23:05.070
and work during the day.

23:05.150 --> 23:08.340
We eat with silverware,
knives and forks...

23:09.080 --> 23:10.980
drink out of glasses...

23:11.620 --> 23:13.210
do the dishes.

23:14.420 --> 23:16.410
Is it bedtime yet?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.420
Molly, wake up.

23:29.540 --> 23:31.060
I'm sorry.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.760
It's not going to work out.

23:34.610 --> 23:37.740
You spent all night at that guy's
house doing God knows what,

23:37.810 --> 23:39.840
then you come here
and crash at work.

23:39.910 --> 23:43.680
I can't believe you did this to me
after all the strings I pulled.

23:43.750 --> 23:46.410
I know that I'm
an undeserving creep,

23:46.490 --> 23:48.820
but can we please
talk about it over lunch?

23:48.890 --> 23:52.090
No! Our lunch date is canceled.
You can't afford lunch.

23:52.160 --> 23:56.360
Fine, see if I care.
I'll live off of water and sunshine.

23:56.430 --> 23:58.090
You won't have to.

23:58.170 --> 24:01.230
Once again your main man
is gonna come through for ya.

24:02.770 --> 24:05.740
You're gonna get me
a record deal.

24:05.810 --> 24:07.360
Not exactly.

24:17.820 --> 24:21.780
Hi!
- Oh, my God.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.650
You're my new nanny?

24:23.720 --> 24:25.850
Hi, Laraine.
- It's Ray.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.560
Nobody calls me Laraine.

24:28.630 --> 24:31.190
Okay, Ray, I'm Molly.

24:31.260 --> 24:33.260
We met at my birthday party,
remember?

24:33.330 --> 24:34.490
You're late.

24:34.570 --> 24:36.090
By, like, a second.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.800
By three and a half minutes.

24:39.870 --> 24:45.330
I have to take my Aciphex
by 4:26, and it's...4:18 right now,

24:45.410 --> 24:48.970
We'll take it when we get home.
- That's when I take my Colitin.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.450
The agency must really be
getting desperate.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.820
I actually am uniquely qualified
for this position,

24:56.890 --> 24:58.720
having spent so many years

24:58.790 --> 25:01.230
developing my skills
as a people person.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.230
Mission accomplished?

25:12.310 --> 25:14.100
Fruit punch?

25:14.170 --> 25:16.610
Why don't you
just drink cyanide?

25:16.680 --> 25:18.230
At least it's quick.

25:22.820 --> 25:23.940
Damn.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.850
Hang your coat up in there.

26:20.070 --> 26:22.230
What is this, The Shining?

26:42.900 --> 26:44.960
Who is that?
- Nobody.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.470
What's wrong with him?
- None of your b-i business.

26:49.540 --> 26:50.940
Shoes!

27:02.680 --> 27:04.740
This is your room?

27:04.820 --> 27:07.290
There's no fooling you,
is there?

27:09.220 --> 27:10.520
It's so...

27:15.560 --> 27:17.150
orderly.

27:20.730 --> 27:22.220
These are so neat!

27:22.300 --> 27:24.400
I remember when there were
only four models.

27:24.470 --> 27:27.410
I can't believe this.
She's beautiful.

27:27.470 --> 27:29.940
Look at these legs.
- That's Pliéing Polly.

27:30.010 --> 27:32.040
Put her back!

27:35.750 --> 27:37.770
How cool is this?

27:37.850 --> 27:39.880
Look at this little tea set!

27:42.920 --> 27:46.820
You don't touch that unless
I happen to invite you to tea.

27:46.890 --> 27:48.920
Look at these cute little scones.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.990
Get away from there.

27:51.060 --> 27:55.260
Well, I say, Lady Sassafras,
would you like some crème fraîche

27:55.340 --> 27:57.900
to go with
your darling pastries?

28:00.710 --> 28:05.800
You just got your germy drool
over my plastic scone, you freako.

28:12.420 --> 28:14.720
Kid, have you ever been
to a shrink?

28:14.790 --> 28:16.150
Since I was three.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.350
What?

28:19.430 --> 28:22.860
Good afternoon, Miss Ray.
Dinner is ready.

28:24.630 --> 28:27.600
There's just nothing
like good help.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.500
You missed a spot.

28:40.110 --> 28:43.240
Isn't doing the dishes what the maid
is supposed to be for?

28:43.320 --> 28:45.650
She doesn't know how to dry
without leaving spots.

28:45.720 --> 28:48.380
You don't know how to dry
without destroying the environment.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.620
For every roll
of paper towels you waste,

28:50.690 --> 28:52.680
a tree in the rain forest dies.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.250
I'm gonna die of botulism

28:54.330 --> 28:56.990
from the germs on that gunky
towel, you tree-loving hippie.

28:57.060 --> 29:01.360
At least I don't prefer tofu
to normal hamburgers.

29:01.430 --> 29:04.670
I'm not the one who's gonna get
mad cow disease and go nuts,

29:04.740 --> 29:07.610
though you don't seem to have
a brain to fry in the first place.

29:07.670 --> 29:11.700
Maybe not, but at least I'm not
holding the germ-infested towel.

29:14.980 --> 29:16.110
Give me that plate.

29:16.180 --> 29:18.170
No, sorry.
You might infect it.

29:19.250 --> 29:22.550
Why don't you get your plastic
baggie and dig up some penicillin?

29:22.620 --> 29:24.090
No!
- Come on.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.390
Give me the plate!
- You want it?

29:26.460 --> 29:27.650
How bad do you want it?

29:31.800 --> 29:33.460
Get a broom.

29:33.530 --> 29:36.160
You get a frickin' broom.

29:37.540 --> 29:40.770
When you work for me,
you leave when I say you can leave.

29:40.840 --> 29:43.470
For your information,
I do not work for you.

29:43.540 --> 29:45.370
I am employed by your mother.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.040
Yeah?
Take a look around.

29:48.110 --> 29:50.110
Do you see her anywhere?

29:50.180 --> 29:53.640
News flash... you're not gonna

29:53.720 --> 29:56.050
unless you make an appointment
with her assistant

29:56.120 --> 29:59.110
or hang around her bedroom door
at 3:00 in the morning.

29:59.190 --> 30:04.220
In the meantime,
you're workin' for me.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.490
Is that so?

30:07.900 --> 30:11.930
News flash, Mussolini...

30:13.370 --> 30:14.860
I quit!

30:20.450 --> 30:23.610
Are you all right, Miss Gunn?
- Just great.

30:31.990 --> 30:33.550
Baby!

30:34.260 --> 30:37.700
Baby, what are you doing outside
all by yourself?

30:40.330 --> 30:43.130
How did you get locked out?

30:45.670 --> 30:47.660
Mama's had a day.

30:55.350 --> 30:59.510
I've lived here for 20 years.
How can you do this?

30:59.590 --> 31:01.520
Aside from that...

31:03.120 --> 31:05.280
This is a family building,
Miss Gunn.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.290
I suggest you find somewhere
you'd be more welcome.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.300
Like Los Angeles.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.350
You will be allowed back
into your apartment

31:12.430 --> 31:15.730
only so long as you are accompanied
by a management representative

31:15.800 --> 31:18.330
and only long enough
to gather your belongings.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.740
That is, those personal belongings
we don't insist on holding

31:21.810 --> 31:25.900
as collateral for the rent
and utilities you owe.

31:25.980 --> 31:29.470
You are otherwise barred
from the premises.

31:58.380 --> 32:00.440
I know this is
a big change for you,

32:00.510 --> 32:03.140
but it'll feel like home
in no time at all.

32:03.220 --> 32:07.020
This is the bedroom...
my bedroom, of course...

32:07.090 --> 32:10.020
but there's plenty
of drawer space if you need it.

32:10.090 --> 32:12.920
I can't believe those creeps
would throw a destitute woman

32:12.990 --> 32:14.480
into the street.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.550
Chivalry is so dead.

32:16.630 --> 32:19.790
This is the bathroom.
I hung up your towels for you.

32:19.870 --> 32:21.990
I've been here
a thousand times.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.560
You know the kitchen.

32:23.640 --> 32:27.130
Julie and Holly come over
Thursdays for our weekly bake fest.

32:27.210 --> 32:30.470
Mondays, Penny and Ethel come
so we can do yoga with Rajiiv

32:30.540 --> 32:32.410
right here in the living room.

32:32.480 --> 32:36.510
But this is going to be
a problem.

32:37.150 --> 32:41.250
Ing, don't you think it's weird
that Neal hasn't called me?

32:41.320 --> 32:43.980
No, but I think it's weird
that you're wearing his jacket.

32:44.060 --> 32:46.580
I told you just bring
the essentials, Molly.

32:46.660 --> 32:49.060
You can't keep all this stuff.

32:49.130 --> 32:52.190
And he definitely has to go.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.800
Mu, what are we gonna do?

32:59.870 --> 33:01.970
Downsize, Molly.
Purify.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.170
Streamline,
find your center,

33:04.240 --> 33:05.710
You're right, Ing.

33:05.780 --> 33:08.770
We're gonna get you the best
housewarming present ever.

33:08.850 --> 33:10.010
Don't be silly.

33:10.080 --> 33:13.450
It's gonna be hard enough on you
coming up with half the rent.

33:31.070 --> 33:33.230
Wonderful, girls.

33:33.310 --> 33:35.900
Tomorrow we start rehearsing
for next month's recital,

33:35.980 --> 33:38.000
but I think we still have
five minutes.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.810
How about a little freestyle?

33:47.990 --> 33:51.010
You sure looked great
out there.

33:54.090 --> 33:57.150
I just, you know...

33:57.230 --> 33:59.930
Yelling at you
the other day and all...

34:01.900 --> 34:03.490
I'm sorry.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.900
What are you doing here?

34:06.970 --> 34:09.969
I called Roma, your mom...

34:11.010 --> 34:15.409
and she said that if you said
that it was okay.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.469
I could have my job back?

34:24.260 --> 34:26.159
You're on probation.

34:32.030 --> 34:34.260
Act your age,
not your shoe size.

34:34.330 --> 34:36.730
How come you left
dance class so early?

34:36.800 --> 34:39.570
That freestyle at the end
looked like so much fun.

34:39.639 --> 34:43.199
Freestyle is for moronic little kids
and hippie freaks.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.070
It's fun.

34:45.139 --> 34:47.870
Fundamentals
are the building blocks of fun.

34:47.949 --> 34:49.070
Says who?

34:49.150 --> 34:53.590
Mikhail Baryshnikov,
who I'm sure you've never heard of.

34:53.650 --> 34:56.989
Ballet is about precision,
discipline, and poise.

34:57.060 --> 34:59.050
They made us take ballet
at Darlington.

34:59.130 --> 35:02.390
I couldn't wait to get out there
and make up all my own moves.

35:02.460 --> 35:04.190
Figures.
Such a sloppy doofus.

35:04.260 --> 35:06.750
Figures. You're such
a pill-popping little tyrant.

35:07.770 --> 35:09.430
Don't ever do that
to me again.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.600
You're hurting me.
- You hurt me.

35:11.670 --> 35:12.870
Take it back.

35:14.610 --> 35:16.070
Take it back.

35:16.610 --> 35:18.200
Fine.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.140
I take it back.

35:23.450 --> 35:25.380
It's a good thing you did.

35:25.450 --> 35:28.180
Otherwise you wouldn't
have gotten your surprise.

35:29.520 --> 35:30.890
Surprise.

35:30.960 --> 35:33.590
I really hate surprises,
and I sincerely doubt

35:33.660 --> 35:36.960
there's anything you could give me
that I don't already have.

35:37.030 --> 35:39.190
There's no harm
in trying, is there?

35:47.610 --> 35:49.270
Ray, are you all right?

35:52.680 --> 35:56.170
My glands are swollen.
I'm having an allergic reaction.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.240
My immune system
is crashing.

35:58.320 --> 36:01.080
Mu stayed with you
one measly little night.

36:01.150 --> 36:02.420
Come on.

36:04.290 --> 36:06.050
And that's all
he's gonna be staying.

36:06.130 --> 36:09.220
Wasn't it fun, though,
sneaking him in and out for his walk?

36:09.300 --> 36:12.530
It was like a real, live adventure.
You know you had fun.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.360
I'm not a swineherd, kook.

36:14.430 --> 36:16.300
Excuse me.
How much is this putter?

36:16.370 --> 36:19.400
This putter is not for sale.
Sorry. This is a mistake.

36:19.470 --> 36:22.030
You don't golf.
- Tiger gave this to me.

36:22.110 --> 36:24.540
Essentials, remember?
You've got to get rid of this junk.

36:24.610 --> 36:25.800
It's essential.

36:27.850 --> 36:29.470
Twenty dollars.
- Ten.

36:29.550 --> 36:30.680
Sold.

36:30.750 --> 36:33.410
Can I talk to you for a second?
Come through here.

36:33.490 --> 36:36.940
Do me a favor, all right?
Watch your step.

36:37.790 --> 36:39.880
This is Kelli.
Kelli, this is Molly.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.150
Pleasure to meet you.

36:41.230 --> 36:43.890
Looks almost as good on her
as it does on you, doesn't it?

36:43.960 --> 36:48.230
Gooey! Looks like Mu isn't
the only pig you hang out with.

36:48.300 --> 36:49.960
Go away!

36:50.040 --> 36:52.800
It must be really hard
getting rid of all this neat stuff.

36:52.870 --> 36:55.310
No, I'm actually loving it.

36:55.370 --> 36:57.370
Really?
- It's very refreshing.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.780
Everybody, once in their life,
should do this

36:59.850 --> 37:04.510
and slough off all the bad...
Wait!

37:04.580 --> 37:07.780
Sorry, This is... mine.

37:07.850 --> 37:11.220
No, I just bought it.
- How much did you pay?

37:11.290 --> 37:13.450
Thirty dollars.
- My friend Rosella gave it to me.

37:13.530 --> 37:15.990
I'll give you 50, 75!

37:16.760 --> 37:18.090
Enough!

37:18.160 --> 37:20.160
We're downsizing, remember?

37:20.230 --> 37:23.830
Sloughing off the excess
to find our center.

37:23.900 --> 37:25.600
You want this, Molly.

37:25.670 --> 37:28.370
Close your eyes
and repeat after me.

37:28.710 --> 37:30.510
I want this.

37:41.820 --> 37:43.190
Miss Gunn?

37:45.520 --> 37:48.020
We're ready to pack this room up
for storage, ma'am.

37:49.900 --> 37:52.800
Can I have just
five more minutes, please?

37:52.870 --> 37:54.560
Okay, sure.
- Thank you.

38:08.550 --> 38:10.010
Is that you?

38:17.620 --> 38:19.320
Dad's a rock star?

38:20.130 --> 38:21.390
Was.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.830
He's dead.

38:24.560 --> 38:27.900
Bet this stuff
is worth a bundle.

38:27.970 --> 38:30.560
I can't just sell it, Ray.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.660
It's my parents' stuff.

38:34.740 --> 38:39.010
No, you're gonna box it up so it
can lay in storage gathering dust.

38:40.510 --> 38:42.670
God, you're pathetic.

38:46.850 --> 38:49.790
That man in the library
in your house...

38:51.490 --> 38:55.020
nurse said he's in a coma
from a massive stroke.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.160
That's your father, huh?

38:59.100 --> 39:00.690
Was.

39:00.770 --> 39:02.830
He's a vegetable now.

39:02.900 --> 39:05.130
Soon he'll be nothing.

39:06.140 --> 39:08.200
That's kind of harsh.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.600
It's a harsh world.

39:17.780 --> 39:19.770
Watch where you're going!

39:34.930 --> 39:37.430
Neal, I really hate talking
to your machine.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.990
Where are you?

39:39.070 --> 39:41.440
I'm still holding on
to your jacket for you.

39:41.510 --> 39:43.910
I know you've been going crazy
trying to reach me,

39:43.980 --> 39:47.430
but I've been
in a transition right now.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.070
I'm, like, Miss Proletariat now.

39:50.150 --> 39:54.450
Mop the floors, spank the brat,
pick up the paycheck on Friday.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.220
I am a woman.
How about you?

39:57.290 --> 39:58.880
Shit!

40:05.730 --> 40:07.720
Get under the tail.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.890
I'm not putting my hand
under his heinie.

40:09.970 --> 40:11.660
Do you want him
to stay here or not?

40:11.740 --> 40:14.640
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!

40:14.710 --> 40:16.770
I'll get him!

40:20.410 --> 40:22.210
Very good.
Now come out of plough.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.440
Very nice.
Breathing. Good.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.880
Pull up under. Very nice.
Molly, out of plough.

40:27.950 --> 40:29.940
Come on, Molly.
Let's go.

40:30.020 --> 40:33.920
Could you please help me?
This is starting to hurt.

40:33.990 --> 40:35.590
Oh, my God.

40:35.660 --> 40:37.250
73... beautiful,

40:37.330 --> 40:38.560
74,

40:38.630 --> 40:40.000
75... very good.

40:40.070 --> 40:41.360
76,

40:41.430 --> 40:42.560
77...

40:42.640 --> 40:44.400
Let me put a few more on.

40:44.470 --> 40:46.230
Ing, here we go.

40:47.340 --> 40:48.600
Waist.

40:49.580 --> 40:52.840
Molly, you get to be in charge
of the chocolate chip cookies.

40:52.910 --> 40:55.070
They're already mixed,
so all you have to do

40:55.150 --> 40:57.240
is put them in the oven
and time them.

40:59.850 --> 41:01.080
Salmonella.

41:06.690 --> 41:08.680
You're letting her do this?

41:08.760 --> 41:10.730
Relax, girls.
It's just cookie mix.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.920
How badly
can she screw it up?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.590
Put it out now!
Put it out!

41:14.670 --> 41:16.860
I'm trying!

41:24.910 --> 41:27.710
Oh, gosh!
This is Neal's jacket!

41:28.910 --> 41:30.850
Put it out!
- Get it out!

41:30.920 --> 41:33.910
Take it back!

41:33.990 --> 41:36.250
Oh, my God!
- Take it back now!

41:36.320 --> 41:38.620
What are you doing, Ray?

41:41.190 --> 41:43.320
Have you gone mad?

41:43.400 --> 41:46.990
There is never, ever an excuse
for hitting another person.

41:47.070 --> 41:48.120
What's going on?

41:48.200 --> 41:51.140
She was laughing at me
because her "au pair"

41:51.200 --> 41:54.540
said that my new nanny
was a slutbag whore.

41:59.040 --> 42:00.510
Go!

42:22.030 --> 42:24.730
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.010
You've reached Ingrid.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.380
Please leave your number
and the time of your call.

42:36.450 --> 42:38.210
Be specific.

42:38.280 --> 42:40.840
Hi, it's Neal calling for Molly.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.910
I hope this is
the right number.

42:48.250 --> 42:50.240
I love Ingrid
with all my heart

42:50.320 --> 42:53.120
and all her cute
Martha Stewart-wannabe friends,

42:53.190 --> 42:55.660
but it's a real estrogen-fest
over there.

42:55.720 --> 42:59.850
A girl needs a testosterone injection
every once in a while.

42:59.930 --> 43:01.950
Not that I think
of you that way.

43:02.030 --> 43:04.020
You're super-sensitive.

43:04.100 --> 43:05.590
Don't be a silly goose.

43:05.670 --> 43:07.860
Please let me
patronize the arts.

43:07.940 --> 43:09.870
Well, actually...

43:11.410 --> 43:13.400
I just signed a deal
with Schleine Records.

43:14.580 --> 43:16.940
Oh, my God.
What?

43:17.010 --> 43:21.350
Oh, my God!
Neal, that's incredible!

43:21.420 --> 43:24.720
That's amazing!
Why didn't you say anything?

43:25.250 --> 43:27.550
I would have, but this is
the first time tonight

43:27.620 --> 43:29.350
I've managed
to get a word in edgewise.

43:29.420 --> 43:30.480
I...

43:35.100 --> 43:37.330
So how did you seal the deal?

43:49.780 --> 43:53.370
I know this one,
This is the deep one,

44:30.390 --> 44:32.410
I guess I looked
deep down inside

44:32.490 --> 44:35.220
and... found that inner hook,

44:35.290 --> 44:37.280
You certainly did...

44:37.960 --> 44:40.550
... and that calls for...

44:41.630 --> 44:44.890
... an outer hook to go with it,

44:48.840 --> 44:51.930
What's that?
- Your lucky jacket.

44:53.440 --> 44:54.700
My lucky...

44:56.950 --> 44:59.880
What have you done to it?
- A few minor improvements.

44:59.950 --> 45:01.310
Improvements?
- Yeah.

45:01.380 --> 45:03.680
You mutilated it!
- No, I fixed it.

45:03.750 --> 45:07.410
Look how great this is. I told you
purple was your magic color.

45:07.490 --> 45:09.080
We have to talk.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.890
Those are the four
most hateful words in English.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.890
I can't see you anymore.

45:13.960 --> 45:16.660
I'm sorry about the jacket.
- It's not about the jacket.

45:16.730 --> 45:19.100
I just can't see you.

45:19.830 --> 45:21.030
That's all.

45:21.100 --> 45:24.770
Right. You just do
the rock star's daughter

45:24.840 --> 45:27.240
so you can tell
your pop star-wannabe mates,

45:27.310 --> 45:29.970
then ride off into the sunset
with your crummy guitar...

45:30.040 --> 45:33.170
It's not like that.
I'm just not in a place...

45:38.420 --> 45:41.680
Ray, can you
turn that down, please?

45:50.770 --> 45:52.760
Thank you.

45:57.970 --> 46:00.940
You're supposed to put
the cream in before the sugar.

46:01.010 --> 46:04.640
I'm not having cream.
I can't gain weight.

46:04.710 --> 46:07.010
My ballet recital
is Friday night, remember?

46:07.080 --> 46:10.210
Right. I remember.

46:11.220 --> 46:15.380
I invited you to afternoon tea.
The least you can do is be polite.

46:15.460 --> 46:18.080
Why are you buttering
my plastic scone?

46:18.730 --> 46:22.420
Why are plastic scones on the table
when we have real food?

46:24.170 --> 46:26.000
You thought they were cute.

46:28.440 --> 46:31.100
Are you still moping
over that disgusting guy?

46:34.180 --> 46:36.440
Other people
always let you down.

46:36.510 --> 46:39.140
Why don't you forget them
and do something for yourself?

46:39.210 --> 46:40.940
Like what?

46:41.020 --> 46:43.280
I don't know.
Something you're good at.

46:43.350 --> 46:45.250
And I don't mean shopping.

46:46.320 --> 46:48.950
Maybe some of us
aren't good at anything.

46:49.020 --> 46:51.390
Every grownup
is good at something.

46:52.660 --> 46:53.890
My bad.

46:53.960 --> 46:56.400
I don't see any grownups
around here.

46:57.100 --> 46:59.690
What's so great
about being a grownup anyway?

47:01.270 --> 47:03.070
So I can turn out like you?

47:03.140 --> 47:04.800
You're scared.

47:06.340 --> 47:09.540
Sometimes when Mu hears people
walking by outside the door,

47:09.610 --> 47:12.740
he gets this funny expression
and runs into the bathroom,

47:12.810 --> 47:15.040
like he thinks
they're coming to get him.

47:15.820 --> 47:17.880
That's how you look.

47:18.620 --> 47:19.950
Where are you going?

47:20.020 --> 47:22.390
If you refuse
to have a nice time with me,

47:22.460 --> 47:25.190
I'm going to have fun
by myself.

47:25.260 --> 47:29.390
Two hundred pliés isn't fun, Ray.
It's slave labor.

47:29.460 --> 47:32.900
Fundamentals are
the building blocks of fun.

47:32.970 --> 47:35.730
Right. I forgot.

47:35.800 --> 47:37.860
What is with
this music, anyway?

47:37.940 --> 47:40.500
It's like a soundtrack
to slit your wrists to.

47:40.580 --> 47:44.200
It happens to be Mozart.
- It happens to be depressing.

47:44.280 --> 47:48.980
If we're gonna have fun, we need
to listen to music that's fun.

47:58.330 --> 48:00.420
I hate to break it to you,

48:00.500 --> 48:05.190
but this junk is not music!

48:05.270 --> 48:08.170
But it sure is fun
to dance to!

48:19.910 --> 48:21.470
Cut it out!

48:21.550 --> 48:23.540
You look like a spastic hyena!

48:23.620 --> 48:27.380
What are you doing?
What is your problem?

48:27.460 --> 48:29.790
Let me go!

48:29.860 --> 48:31.720
What are you doing?

48:48.840 --> 48:50.470
Grow up.

48:55.750 --> 48:57.340
Where are you going now?

48:57.420 --> 49:00.250
I have about a million
last-minute errands to run

49:00.320 --> 49:03.380
and a date with this
normal adult guy I met.

49:03.460 --> 49:05.860
He's in computers.

49:05.930 --> 49:08.920
Ing, I am so sick
of all of these rock 'n' rollers,

49:09.000 --> 49:12.430
overpaid jocks,
and supermodel bitch boys.

49:14.900 --> 49:17.960
You know, I thought maybe,

49:18.040 --> 49:20.410
just maybe, you'd remember
we had plans tonight.

49:21.280 --> 49:25.270
Green tea tasting
at the Asia Society, remember?

49:27.550 --> 49:31.450
If I never have a drop of tea again,
it would be too soon.

49:31.520 --> 49:35.080
Please, go without me.
You'll have fun, Ing.

49:35.160 --> 49:36.920
I'm already a half-hour late.

49:36.990 --> 49:38.980
We were supposed
to go together.

49:39.060 --> 49:41.390
I RSVP'd over a month ago.

49:41.460 --> 49:43.560
It's too late
to invite anyone else.

49:43.630 --> 49:47.590
We're roomies, Ing.
That's why I pay half the rent.

49:48.340 --> 49:51.790
It doesn't mean I owe you
every minute of my free time.

49:51.870 --> 49:53.030
Owe me?

49:53.210 --> 49:58.800
You mean, for free yoga or nearly
burning down my apartment?

49:58.880 --> 50:01.850
Owe me? Is that what you
think of our friendship?

50:01.920 --> 50:06.110
Only because you think friendship
is having total control over my life.

50:06.190 --> 50:09.420
Unfortunately, you don't know
how to run your life, Molly.

50:09.490 --> 50:12.120
Fortunately,
that's not your problem.

50:12.860 --> 50:14.230
Not anymore.

50:19.630 --> 50:21.070
Look at you.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.770
You got rollers in your hair.
Is that your new style?

50:25.840 --> 50:27.770
I forgot.
I was in a hurry.

50:27.840 --> 50:29.330
Just playing.
Come here.

50:31.080 --> 50:32.710
Huey, my suitcases.

50:32.780 --> 50:34.110
My bad.

50:34.180 --> 50:36.880
Your room is that way.
Put your bags in there.

50:36.950 --> 50:38.510
I got your bed made up.

50:38.590 --> 50:40.710
Sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

50:40.790 --> 50:43.550
Okay. Thank you
for taking me in like this.

50:43.620 --> 50:47.250
Don't even trip. We all know
Ingrid can be a little anal.

50:47.330 --> 50:49.020
It's all good.
Besides...

50:49.100 --> 50:51.190
life with Huey
is one big party.

50:51.270 --> 50:55.290
Party time!

51:00.310 --> 51:02.640
That's what I'm talkin' about.

51:04.480 --> 51:06.140
Your turn.

51:21.300 --> 51:23.460
Bravo!

51:23.530 --> 51:25.560
Beautiful,

51:27.030 --> 51:28.020
Lovely.

51:36.040 --> 51:37.030
Yeah!

51:51.990 --> 51:53.550
Molly, no!

51:54.700 --> 51:56.090
Hi, Roma.

51:57.930 --> 51:59.830
It's me... Molly.

51:59.900 --> 52:02.270
Ray's nanny?

52:02.940 --> 52:04.730
Yes, of course.

52:04.810 --> 52:07.170
I was at your birthday party.
- Yeah.

52:07.240 --> 52:09.230
I'm a fan of your father's.

52:09.310 --> 52:11.540
He had that one song...
What was it?

52:11.610 --> 52:14.240
With your name in it.
- Yes.

52:14.320 --> 52:17.310
I was just wondering,
'cause it's my night off...

52:17.390 --> 52:18.850
who's watching Ray?

52:18.920 --> 52:21.510
She's at some
ballet thing or other,

52:21.590 --> 52:23.420
Oh, God.

52:23.490 --> 52:26.930
It's her recital?
I have to get over there.

52:26.990 --> 52:28.990
I'm sure it's over by now.

52:29.060 --> 52:31.430
I've arranged
to have a car pick her up, okay?

52:31.500 --> 52:32.990
Excuse me for a moment.

52:33.070 --> 52:34.430
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.

53:13.410 --> 53:16.000
Rise and shine, Ophelia.

53:16.080 --> 53:19.840
Hello, my little sugar pie.
How you doin'?

53:19.910 --> 53:22.110
Isn't it your day off?

53:22.750 --> 53:24.620
Indeed it is.

53:25.890 --> 53:27.380
And it's yours, too.

53:27.460 --> 53:32.190
No school, no homework,
and especially no fatal illnesses.

53:32.260 --> 53:33.420
Let me see this.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.290
Look at this.

53:37.370 --> 53:39.930
Perfect 98.6,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.700
only 20 degrees
above the temperature

53:42.770 --> 53:45.000
of the beautiful day
awaiting us.

53:45.070 --> 53:48.800
I'm not going anywhere,
especially with you.

53:48.880 --> 53:50.810
Oh, yes, you are.

53:53.780 --> 53:56.380
We are going to sit
in giant teacups

53:56.450 --> 54:00.150
and spin round and round
in circles until we puke.

54:00.220 --> 54:02.550
Are you on crack?

54:03.460 --> 54:04.950
We're gonna have fun.

54:10.230 --> 54:12.790
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

54:12.870 --> 54:15.560
You are gonna so love
Coney Island, Ray.

54:15.640 --> 54:18.700
Giant teacups you sit in.

54:18.770 --> 54:23.300
It's a ride, Ray,
like the ones at Disneyland.

54:25.650 --> 54:27.880
Haven't you ever been
to Disneyland?

54:29.850 --> 54:33.340
You've never been to Disneyland?
- Why don't you alert the media?

54:33.420 --> 54:37.820
Haven't you ever been
to an amusement park... ever?

54:38.930 --> 54:40.450
Oh, my God!

54:41.460 --> 54:44.330
Ray, you are so psyched!
- Whatever!

54:45.370 --> 54:48.630
Say it, Ray.
Say, "I am so psyched."

54:48.700 --> 54:50.690
I'm psyched, okay?

54:51.610 --> 54:53.900
Then you're gonna
have to pay the toll.

54:53.970 --> 54:55.970
It's like passing
through the gates

54:56.040 --> 54:58.200
before you can get
into the Emerald City.

54:58.280 --> 55:00.370
Let me go.
Are you trying to murder me?

55:00.450 --> 55:03.010
You have to eat one,
or they're not gonna let you in.

55:03.080 --> 55:05.070
They're toxic, you maniac.

55:05.150 --> 55:07.140
They have dead rats
and nitrates.

55:07.220 --> 55:11.210
Do you want to ride
the Spinning Teacups or not?

55:23.870 --> 55:25.360
Now swallow.

55:26.010 --> 55:27.670
Swallow.

55:34.620 --> 55:35.980
Wait.

55:42.120 --> 55:44.180
She's alive.

55:44.260 --> 55:45.590
She's alive!

55:45.660 --> 55:48.490
The operation was a success,
ladies and gentlemen!

55:48.560 --> 55:50.120
She's alive!

56:09.480 --> 56:10.850
Excuse me.

56:10.920 --> 56:13.180
Why is it so dead around here?

56:13.250 --> 56:16.660
The rides don't run
till the season starts.

56:16.720 --> 56:18.590
The season?

56:19.160 --> 56:21.290
You're a week early.

56:22.660 --> 56:24.100
Thanks.

57:17.550 --> 57:19.250
Let's go home.

57:36.440 --> 57:41.200
The last time I saw my mom
and dad, I was eight going on nine...

57:41.280 --> 57:44.540
eight years, six months,
and three days,

57:44.610 --> 57:47.240
almost as old as you are.

57:47.310 --> 57:51.380
They were going on tour,
leaving me behind for the first time.

57:51.450 --> 57:53.980
They didn't want me
missing any more school.

57:54.050 --> 57:56.320
When they came to my room
to say good-bye.

57:56.390 --> 58:00.220
I wouldn't open the door,
so they left.

58:00.290 --> 58:02.060
I fell asleep.

58:02.900 --> 58:04.920
The next thing I knew...

58:05.870 --> 58:08.460
my nanny was waking me up
in the middle of the night

58:08.540 --> 58:11.060
telling me
their plane had crashed.

58:11.140 --> 58:13.540
You're lucky.
- Lucky?

58:13.610 --> 58:15.510
That you were mad.

58:16.340 --> 58:19.040
When you're mad,
you don't miss people,

58:19.110 --> 58:22.640
and if you stay mad,
it's like you never knew them at all.

58:22.720 --> 58:25.310
That way you don't
have to feel sucky about it.

58:25.890 --> 58:27.480
You were lucky.

58:30.490 --> 58:31.620
Night.

58:33.960 --> 58:36.020
I wasn't mad, Ray.

58:37.630 --> 58:39.790
I was confused.

58:40.470 --> 58:42.700
Everyone was talking to me,

58:42.770 --> 58:45.530
and I couldn't understand
a word they were saying.

58:47.370 --> 58:49.970
Then their voices
became a blur...

58:51.010 --> 58:53.980
and soon I couldn't even
recognize their faces.

58:55.020 --> 58:57.140
They were like these blobs.

58:58.390 --> 59:00.850
Then they started
to grow fangs...

59:01.860 --> 59:04.050
and their eyes
became green.

59:05.190 --> 59:07.390
I knew I had to run away.

59:09.430 --> 59:11.420
I packed my knapsack,

59:11.500 --> 59:15.160
got on the train,
looked up at the map,

59:15.240 --> 59:18.670
and decided that I wanted
to live in Coney Island.

59:19.540 --> 59:23.500
I thought
it was gonna be a real island...

59:24.680 --> 59:29.080
and I could hide away there like
Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.

59:29.150 --> 59:31.520
Imagine my surprise.

59:31.590 --> 59:35.080
The Teacups was the only ride
they'd let me on by myself.

59:35.160 --> 59:40.460
I got on it and started
spinning myself round and round.

59:41.230 --> 59:43.590
I feel like I'm still there,

59:43.660 --> 59:46.630
spinning round
and round and round,

59:46.700 --> 59:49.230
and the ride won't stop,

59:49.300 --> 59:51.770
and I won't dare get off.

59:54.110 --> 59:56.100
You were right, Ray.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.220
I am scared.

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.190
But you're scared, too.

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:14.660
You're as scared as I am.

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:17.200
and I thought maybe...

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.220
I thought maybe if we...

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.300
could go together...

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.860
Morning, cutie.

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:28.190
You hungry?

01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:50.080
You're up a little early.

01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:01.120
What are you doing here?

01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:04.960
I happen to work here.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.530
What are you doing?

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:08.730
Don't forget the sugar, sugar!

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.860
Just breathe.

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.110
Lady!

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.210
Lady, that water
is contaminated, you know.

01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:27.480
You better get out of there.

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:29.780
That's pure sewage
you're in, there.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.220
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me?

01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:36.060
Yeah, I heard you!
- That water's filthy!

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:38.220
If you don't get out.
I'll call the police.

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.100
I'm getting out.

01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:57.440
A hundred and one degrees.

01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:59.680
Sick as a dog.

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:02.090
You better hope
you don't get radiation poisoning

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.520
from that toxic pond scum.

01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:06.990
Take two Echinacea

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:10.090
and a Benadryl
for your sinuses.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.500
Okay.
- Call me if you need anything else.

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:14.430
Stay here, Mu.

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:19.430
Where are you going?

01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:21.100
I don't know.

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:23.070
Maybe the library.

01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:26.840
Is that where you went
last night?

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:29.640
I'm not gonna bother him.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.740
I'm just gonna sit quietly
and read or something.

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:35.790
You can read out loud.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.620
I think he might like that.

01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:39.960
He's a vegetable, Molly.

01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:44.160
Chatting it up with my dad isn't
gonna do anyone any good at all.

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:45.790
You're the doctor.

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:48.230
It's not gonna do any good.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:51.200
I saw this show once on TV

01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:53.600
about all these sick people.

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:58.080
The ones where their friends
and families talked to them

01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:02.450
held on ten times longer
than the ones left all alone,

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.950
and that is a fact.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:11.360
Do you swear?

01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:14.020
I swear.

01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:16.960
Pinky promise?

01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:19.630
Don't touch.

01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:24.200
Germs. Sorry.
- Germs. Right.

01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:30.100
Wanna come?

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:39.650
Can I help you
with something?

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.250
She's going to go talk to him
for a little while.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.620
You know... privately?

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.930
I can't think of what to say.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.520
There's an all-time first.

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:09.540
Hey, Dad.

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.710
I know I haven't...

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.580
Well, what I really wanted
to tell you was about my new pet.

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.790
It's really Molly's,
my nanny,

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:24.160
but the thing is,

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:28.000
it's a pig... literally.

01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:30.660
His name is Mu.

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.830
He's from Thailand.

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:35.530
He's really clean,
I have to admit,

01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:37.700
even if he is a pig.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:45.810
Anyway, what I'm really into
these days is ballet.

01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:49.520
You and Mom used to say
that it was old-fashioned,

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:51.780
but I swear it's really cool.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:54.880
I'm already doing
changements and chaînèes...

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.930
you know, when you spin
and spin and spin,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.830
It used to make me dizzy.

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:02.370
Now I'm only dizzy when I stop.

01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:20.920
What a one-hit wonder
that slut turned out to be.

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:23.220
It's his first single.
It just dropped.

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:26.920
It's been playing in my head
for weeks, and it sucks.

01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:28.320
What is this?

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.090
This is so '80s
it makes my hair pouf.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.320
Hold up. Listen.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.560
I produced this video,
and the '80s are back.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.300
I don't know
where you've been.

01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:41.900
Listening to Tchaikovsky,
Mozart, and Chopin.

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:46.170
You wouldn't know real music if I
hit you on the head with it, Gooey.

01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:49.540
You're gonna stop
calling me Gooey.

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:50.980
So?

01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:55.380
What do you think?
- What is it?

01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.750
It's a tutu, silly.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.550
For what, a midget?

01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:02.600
No, for a little girl
named Ray.

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.990
Her year-end dance recital
is coming up.

01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:07.730
The costumes are so boring,
I figured I'd surprise her

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.130
with something
pretty spectacular.

01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:23.850
He's wearing the jacket!

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.680
That's my jacket!
I made that jacket!

01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:30.790
That was my idea!

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:41.600
He is the Lizard King
Reincarnated.

01:08:43.569 --> 01:08:45.560
No, listen to me.
Look at me.

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.340
I'm the lizard king.

01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:52.710
This guy, he's nothing
but an illusion.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:56.240
He ain't real.
Everything he is, I made.

01:08:56.319 --> 01:08:59.310
You want real,
you want substance,

01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:01.979
look no further
than what you got in front of you.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.550
I'm the lizard king,

01:09:06.729 --> 01:09:08.720
You're right, Huey.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.090
True friends, true hearts.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.500
That is what counts in life.

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:16.590
That's right.
Hit me one.

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:18.640
Give me some love.

01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:23.870
That's funny.
I wasn't expecting anyone.

01:09:23.939 --> 01:09:25.640
Go see who it is.

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:32.210
Hey, man.

01:09:32.290 --> 01:09:34.149
What's going on?

01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:42.660
Hi, 81st and 5th, please.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.640
When did it happen?
- He passed away this afternoon.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.420
I'm so sorry.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.270
You promised.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.710
Miss Gunn, Mrs. Schleine
is waiting for you in the study.

01:10:46.230 --> 01:10:49.290
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Schleine.
- Thanks for coming, Miss Gunn.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.060
Are you kidding?

01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:53.360
Nothing could keep me away
at a time like this.

01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:55.870
Last week's pay
and a month's severance.

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.100
Severance?

01:10:59.170 --> 01:11:01.070
We're letting you go.

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.370
"We"?

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.570
That's right.
Me and Ray.

01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:09.950
We.
Good night, Miss Gunn.

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:16.690
I'm sorry, but I'm not leaving
without an explanation.

01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:23.190
I don't know what's been going on
between you and my daughter,

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:26.030
but she has made it clear
she never wants to see you again.

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:28.970
She must be going
out of her mind with grief.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.270
Actually, she's taking it
rather well.

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:35.000
I was at my staff meeting when I
got the news about my husband.

01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:37.980
I came home to find Ray
finishing her homework.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.880
She's been very calm
and level-headed about this whole affair.

01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:45.750
You call that taking it well?

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.760
Do you know what ètage
your daughter's at in ballet?

01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:54.720
Or that she was banned
from her science class

01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:59.090
for stealing a formaldehyde pig
so she could give it a proper burial?

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:01.570
The tea set you got her...

01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:04.540
it's exquisite and beautiful,

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.000
but do you know
how she likes to have her tea,

01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:09.670
how many lumps...
one, two... cream, sugar?

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.900
And the point
of your little tirade is...

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:13.140
You're right.

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:17.240
You don't know what goes on
between me and Ray

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.520
because you don't know very much
about your own daughter.

01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:24.820
I know my daughter well enough
to respect her wishes.

01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:29.050
You don't give her respect.

01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:32.930
You give her whatever she asks for
so you don't have to deal with her.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.630
She's eight years old.

01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:39.730
She is not 28.

01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:47.110
Please remember that the next time
you show her some "respect."

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:01.280
It's my muse.
- Getting in your way again.

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:06.290
Molly, I came here to see you.

01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:08.660
For what?

01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:12.500
I haven't been able to write
a single decent song

01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:14.670
since we last saw each other.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.840
Molly, I'm sorry. I was trying
to take a step forward,

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:22.210
but I took two steps
backward instead.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.910
Why don't you take
one step sideways?

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:26.920
Then we can stop doing
this silly little dance.

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:31.290
So that's the Molly M.O.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.660
When I'm not ready,
you hunt me down.

01:13:33.730 --> 01:13:36.290
When I try and make it work,
you're not interested.

01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:42.460
Ever since we met,
it's about what I'm doing wrong...

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:45.930
but I'm not the one
with the problem.

01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:49.340
You are,
you and your selfishness.

01:13:49.410 --> 01:13:51.740
All you do is take.

01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:55.940
I've got nothing for you
right now, so...

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:59.780
maybe it's time to start thinking
about someone other than yourself.

01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:01.150
Till then...

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.930
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:16.100
Now we'll start the bidding
on this important collection

01:14:16.170 --> 01:14:19.730
representing a vital chapter
in American musical history.

01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:23.640
Tommy Gunn was an essential
member of several landmark bands.

01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:25.540
He scored a solo hit
with "Molly Smiles"...

01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:28.980
Maybe we should wait a few minutes
till everyone shows up.

01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:32.750
I'm afraid this is about as good
as it's going to get.

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:35.120
We have here Tommy Gunn's
signature acoustic,

01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:38.020
which he played with his first band
in Haight-Ashbury.

01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:41.620
Bidding starts at $2,500.
Do I hear $2,500?

01:14:41.690 --> 01:14:43.690
2,500.
- I have $2,500.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.660
Do I hear $2,600?
- 2,500?

01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:47.320
2,600.
- Thank you.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.730
2,500?

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:52.100
I'm sorry. We put out feelers,
but unfortunately

01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:55.070
the excitement generated
by Mr. Gunn's memorabilia

01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:58.200
fell somewhat short
of expectations.

01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.370
I have 3,000.

01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:01.470
3,000 going once,

01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:02.980
3,000 going twice...

01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:06.750
75,000!
I have an offer of 75,000...

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:09.340
from a buyer who wishes
to remain anonymous...

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:11.480
for the entire collection.

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.530
Well? What do you say?

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.460
It's up to you.

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:27.230
Frankly, I can't envision
a much better result

01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:29.370
from selling it off piecemeal.

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:33.910
This is everything that he's
left behind in the whole world.

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:38.740
This is my dad.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.710
I'm sorry.

01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:49.290
Just get rid of it.

01:15:58.140 --> 01:15:59.600
Molly, where are you taking me?

01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:03.940
The fellas are waiting for us
at the club.

01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:06.810
The fellas can wait, Huey.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.610
This is important.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:11.670
Hold up.
Molly, please.

01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:14.350
They better have
a defibrillator up there.

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:17.510
Gooey, suck it up.
It's good for your heinie.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.590
Welcome
to Le Château Chez Molly.

01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.560
This is...
- It's my new apartment.

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:31.830
This way is the kitchen area,

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.900
and over here
in this direction,

01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:38.240
you'll find the very private,
secluded bathroom section.

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:40.140
Fabulous, huh?

01:16:40.210 --> 01:16:43.550
You're standing in the living room,
which, coincidentally,

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:45.170
happens to be...

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:48.750
the bedroom.

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.310
It's got potential, huh?

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:53.980
As a detention cell
for convicted felons, maybe.

01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:56.490
Molly, this isn't you.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.830
I can't afford me
anymore, Huey.

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.660
Nobody's kicking you out.
You can still stay with me.

01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:06.540
I really have to stand on
my own two feet right now, okay?

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.130
Okay.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.080
Hello?

01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:18.050
Roma, how would I know
where Ray is?

01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:21.880
What's going on with Ray?

01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:23.440
Hold on one second.

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:25.520
Thanks.

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:28.420
Roma? Hi.
It's Molly.

01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:32.160
Miss Gunn, I know
that you've been let go,

01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:36.860
but is there any chance that
you've seen my daughter today?

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:39.930
Are you sure?

01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:44.040
Ray didn't come home
from school.

01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:46.100
She's been missing ever since.

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:48.170
I thought
that she might have...

01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:52.380
If you hear from her,
please let me know.

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:55.020
Huey, talk to her.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.960
You all right?
- I'm fine, thanks.

01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:43.480
It's nice to see you again.
- You, too.

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.550
I really miss you.
- I miss you.

01:20:46.090 --> 01:20:47.990
These are crummy circumstances.

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.580
Molly Gunn?
- Yeah.

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:51.150
How you doin'?
- Good.

01:20:51.230 --> 01:20:53.200
Good to meet you.
- Same here.

01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:56.960
I saw that kid Neal Fox's video.
Didn't you create his look?

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.900
No, I just fixed his jacket.

01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:02.410
I don't know why
everybody's talking about it.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.470
Do you do pants, too?

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.980
Cool leather ones
that aren't over the top?

01:21:07.050 --> 01:21:09.240
I'm hoping you can hook me up
with a jacket.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.840
Not the same one, obviously,
but with a similar vibe.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:14.390
Guys, thank you.
You're very sweet.

01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:17.620
It was sort of
a big accident, yeah.

01:21:17.690 --> 01:21:20.450
It's a hell of an accident.
What do you think?

01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:26.460
I would love to.
- Cool.

01:21:26.530 --> 01:21:28.230
Done.
- Pants, too.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.700
Guys, Garth Brooks
wants to meet you.

01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:32.640
You're kidding.
- He's over there.

01:21:32.710 --> 01:21:35.170
Excuse us. Mr. Brooks?
- Okay. Yeah.

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.270
Let's go.
- Awesome.

01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:12.130
Thanks.

01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:19.240
No, that's yours.

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.480
Molly, I just spoke with her.

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.920
She's almost ready
to meet with people,

01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:27.890
but she wants
to talk to you first.

01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:38.700
You can have
your job back, you know.

01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:41.670
I don't think so.

01:22:42.370 --> 01:22:43.860
You and I...

01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:47.410
we're gonna be friends.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.850
Okay?

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:54.180
Grownups never stay friends
with kids.

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:58.050
I don't see any grownups
around here.

01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:02.080
I do.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.090
You know the Dalai Lama?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.130
I've always thought of myself
as a people person.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:16.440
Most Fashion Institute applicants
would kill for references like yours.

01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:18.500
Seems to me
you could skip school

01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.070
and find work with one
of your designer friends.

01:23:21.150 --> 01:23:24.480
It would be more fun than
toiling away here for four years.

01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:27.780
Fundamentals are
the building blocks of fun...

01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:31.820
I always say.

01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:34.290
Oh, God.

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.220
Man, she's gonna kill me.

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.460
I'm really sorry.

01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:44.630
Okay. Sorry.

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:47.540
Please call me
and I will call you,

01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:50.040
and thank you.

01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:52.170
Have a great day. Bye.

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:56.310
She always does this to me.
She's not coming.

01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:59.170
If you'd quit wiggling your ass,

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:01.520
it wouldn't have fallen off
in the first place.

01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:11.830
Coming through.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.590
Excuse me.

01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:21.770
To conclude our program,
we present a special performance...

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.140
Are you okay?
- By Laraine Schleine.

01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:35.080
And to accompany Miss Schleine,

01:24:35.150 --> 01:24:39.090
we are pleased to present
a very special guest.

01:24:59.910 --> 01:25:01.380
How's it going?

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.820
There's someone here today
who lent us a bit of her magic,

01:25:07.890 --> 01:25:11.790
and now we'd like
to give some of it back.

01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:16.380
This was Tommy Gunn's
favorite guitar,

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:19.120
and I'm going to sing you
the song he wrote

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.860
for his favorite person
in the world.

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:25.170
This one goes out
to Molly Gunn.

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.770
Every story has an end,

01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:21.540
but in life,

01:28:21.610 --> 01:28:23.980
every ending
is just a new beginning.

01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:32.860
Nothing's wrong
when Molly smiles

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:50.000
