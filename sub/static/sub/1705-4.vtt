WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:03.903
Air and naval
forces of the United States

00:03.905 --> 00:06.305
launched a series of strikes
against terrorist facilities...

00:06.307 --> 00:08.741
Pan Am flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.

00:08.743 --> 00:10.242
He has sanctioned
acts of terror

00:10.244 --> 00:12.845
in Africa, Europe and
the Middle East.

00:12.847 --> 00:15.481
This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.349
This relentless
pursuit of terror.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.918
We will make no distinction...

00:18.920 --> 00:20.486
The USS Cole was attacked

00:20.488 --> 00:21.754
while refueling in
the port of Aden.

00:21.756 --> 00:23.656
This was an act of terrorism.

00:23.658 --> 00:26.192
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.427
The next samba
we're going to swing for you

00:28.429 --> 00:29.662
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:29.664 --> 00:32.264
...until something stops him.

00:32.266 --> 00:35.134
It was right
in front of my eyes,

00:35.136 --> 00:36.802
and I never saw it coming.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.839
That plane crashed
into the World Trade Center.

00:39.841 --> 00:42.274
Thousands of people running.

00:42.276 --> 00:46.378
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.453
You're the smartest
and the dumbest fucking person

00:54.455 --> 00:56.555
I've ever known.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.224
I'm not the
one who got it wrong.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.559
I'm the only one
who got it right.

01:04.164 --> 01:06.031
Take 'em.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.000
Take 'em all.

01:08.002 --> 01:11.103
Roll every available ambulance
you got to this position.

01:15.172 --> 01:17.947
Homeland - 3x04
"Game On"

01:18.845 --> 01:20.846
Previously on Homeland...

01:20.848 --> 01:22.514
Where am I?

01:22.516 --> 01:23.983
Caracas.

01:23.985 --> 01:25.484
Your new home.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.986
Perhaps you'd care to comment

01:26.988 --> 01:28.988
on the article
in yesterday's paper.

01:28.990 --> 01:30.723
The case officer in question,

01:30.725 --> 01:32.758
she's been diagnosed as bipolar.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.660
Carrie.

01:34.662 --> 01:35.895
She called a reporter.

01:35.897 --> 01:37.897
Apparently, she thinks
it's important

01:37.899 --> 01:39.932
they, quote, "Hear her side
of the story."

01:39.934 --> 01:42.568
I just wanted you to know
I'm gonna stop her.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.069
I'm sorry.

01:44.071 --> 01:46.538
Get off of me!

01:46.540 --> 01:48.574
This is a fucking sham!

01:51.177 --> 01:54.446
Dana has made great
progress over the last month.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.282
She's doing well.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.017
You mean for someone
who got in the bathtub

01:58.019 --> 01:59.051
and tried to slit her wrists.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.586
Your sister's gone.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.856
I just really needed
to see you.

02:03.858 --> 02:06.191
He's not good for you.

02:06.193 --> 02:08.794
And that is based on what,
not knowing him at all?

02:08.795 --> 02:09.862
He's unstable.

02:09.864 --> 02:11.196
I know what you're here for.

02:11.198 --> 02:12.698
To examine the bank records.

02:12.700 --> 02:17.036
You're following the money
to this guy here,

02:17.038 --> 02:19.238
Majid Javadi.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.373
The Iranian
who fronted the attack

02:21.375 --> 02:23.442
on this Agency
that occurred on 12/12.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.611
I was wondering if you could
tell Saul Berenson

02:25.613 --> 02:27.146
how much better I'm doing.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.315
We both know I'm not here
because I'm crazy.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.951
I'm here because they don't
know where else to put me.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.221
I'm an associate
at Bennett, Parr & Hamilton.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.390
One of our partners
would like to meet with you.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.259
I'm talking about getting
you out of here.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.127
- I know what you're doing.
- What do you mean?

02:42.129 --> 02:43.829
- No, you think I'm vulnerable.
- Not at all.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.431
No, worse than that,
you think I'm weak.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.999
And maybe with just
the right incentive,

02:47.001 --> 02:48.901
I'll turn against the
people who did this to me.

02:48.903 --> 02:51.170
So whoever the hell it is
that you're working for--

02:51.172 --> 02:52.905
they Syrians, the
Israelis, the Iranians--

02:52.907 --> 02:55.641
you tell them I would
rather die in here.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:07.020 --> 03:09.121
Let me go!

03:09.123 --> 03:11.123
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

03:11.125 --> 03:12.824
Hold still!

03:17.330 --> 03:18.864
Get her on the bed.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.399
No! No!

03:20.401 --> 03:21.800
- No, please!
- Take her.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.368
No! No, let me go!

03:23.370 --> 03:25.037
Hold still! Come on!

03:25.039 --> 03:26.572
No! No! No!

03:26.574 --> 03:28.140
Get her on the bed!

03:28.142 --> 03:29.575
No! No! No!

03:29.577 --> 03:30.709
Hold still!

03:30.711 --> 03:31.677
No!

03:31.679 --> 03:32.911
Get her legs.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.546
Help! Leave me alone!

03:34.548 --> 03:36.415
- No!
- Hold her legs!

03:36.417 --> 03:37.516
Let me go!

03:37.518 --> 03:38.850
Hold her legs!

03:38.852 --> 03:42.421
Let me go! No, no, no!

03:42.423 --> 03:44.523
No!

03:55.935 --> 03:59.871
Everything in here okay?

03:59.873 --> 04:01.240
I'm not gonna repeat myself.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.507
Everything's okay.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.910
This door stays open.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.433
Good morning.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.768
Morning.

04:31.070 --> 04:33.272
I did what you said.
I followed the money.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.740
The missing five percent.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.041
Right.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.110
Turns out it's
skimmed off the top

04:38.112 --> 04:39.711
once the funds
arrive in Caracas

04:39.713 --> 04:42.114
at the HLBC subsidiary there.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.782
Which happens when?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.584
The third Friday of each month.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.119
Tell me how it works.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.888
Well, first it's converted
into small bills.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.424
Stacked on pallets,

04:52.426 --> 04:54.559
loaded into a truck
and delivered

04:54.561 --> 04:57.462
in the dead of the night
to the Estadio Capital

04:57.464 --> 05:00.165
where it's held at the
box office until the next day

05:00.167 --> 05:02.968
and declared as receipts
for the weekly football match.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.071
I bet you didn't know that
Del Paraiso FC draws more fans

05:06.073 --> 05:08.940
on those Saturdays than they
have seats in their stadium.

05:08.942 --> 05:12.411
That's a hell of
a way to clean money.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.578
And lots of it.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.281
By our estimates,
over $45 million

05:16.283 --> 05:17.916
during the last ten years.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.319
So somebody's got a sidebar
with the bank.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.820
Who?

05:21.822 --> 05:23.255
The owner of the team?

05:23.257 --> 05:25.424
Probably.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.359
Except it's hard to know
who that is exactly.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.027
The club is structured
in such a way

05:29.029 --> 05:30.696
so as to shield the identity

05:30.698 --> 05:32.097
of its majority shareholder.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.865
You got a candidate, though,
don't you?

05:33.867 --> 05:37.669
I do.
Just not one that makes sense.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.938
Nasser Hejazi.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.173
Say again.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.341
Nasser Hejazi.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.942
Do you know him?

05:45.511 --> 05:48.280
I know he played goalkeeper
for Iran's 1978 World Cup team.

05:48.282 --> 05:49.715
He's a legend there.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.350
Well, it can't be
that Nasser Hejazi.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.351
Why not?

05:52.353 --> 05:53.819
Because he's dead.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.854
Who's dead?

05:56.889 --> 05:59.191
I heard you were in
the building.

05:59.193 --> 06:02.060
I left the DOJ documents
on your desk.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.795
Yeah, I saw.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.630
You still want me
to handle that?

06:05.632 --> 06:08.467
Yeah.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.038
I'll be up in a minute.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.273
I'll be waiting.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.581
Where were we?

06:22.583 --> 06:25.083
Exactly nowhere.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.318
Unless...

06:26.320 --> 06:29.154
What?

06:29.156 --> 06:32.591
Say I'm an Iranian official
whose job it is

06:32.593 --> 06:36.395
to fund terrorist operations
in the Western hemisphere.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.662
Okay.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.899
Say I'm watching all these bankers
get rich on the deal.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.734
Why not me, too?

06:42.736 --> 06:46.772
Well, because you'd be taking
a huge risk, for one thing.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.240
Which is why I go

06:48.242 --> 06:51.042
to such great lengths
to launder the proceeds,

06:51.044 --> 06:54.479
all the while hiding
behind a false identity.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.182
Like a goalkeeper's.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.617
Right.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.386
Still, if the Revolutionary
Guard ever finds out

07:01.388 --> 07:03.021
you've been embezzling
all that money...

07:03.023 --> 07:05.891
Maybe I'm getting
to the end of my career.

07:05.893 --> 07:09.327
Maybe I'm looking
to retire in style.

07:10.630 --> 07:14.599
Maybe I've always dreamed
of owning a soccer team.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.870
Javadi?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.405
Why Javadi?

07:20.407 --> 07:22.874
Because it was his operation
in the first place.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.743
'Cause it makes sense
that he was the one

07:24.745 --> 07:26.812
to approach
the Venezuelan bank.

07:26.814 --> 07:32.017
And because Nasser Hejazi
was his boyhood hero.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.654
Don't smile yet.

07:35.656 --> 07:38.123
Right now it's just a theory.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.339
Morning, Carrie.
How we feeling today?

07:54.341 --> 07:55.640
You have a brush?

07:55.642 --> 07:57.943
Yeah. You sleep okay?

07:57.945 --> 07:59.511
Uh, yeah, fine.

07:59.513 --> 08:02.147
So, I did a final review
of your doctors and therapists,

08:02.149 --> 08:04.115
followed up
with them last night.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.751
They all give you
excellent reports.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.153
Do you have any blush?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.321
You look fine.

08:09.323 --> 08:12.023
I look like a ghost.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.193
My dad and sister
are coming, right?

08:15.195 --> 08:16.428
Yeah, they'll be here.

08:16.430 --> 08:17.863
I called to remind them
yesterday.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.264
Maybe I should just say

08:19.266 --> 08:21.199
I'm gonna go live
with them for a while.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.968
I don't think that's necessary.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.103
The fact that they are committed
to helping you transition back

08:25.105 --> 08:27.005
into the community
is more than enough.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.207
Well, I don't want to
leave anything to chance.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.642
Trust me, we're not.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.943
Here, let me.

08:31.945 --> 08:35.614
So, the medical staff
is first up.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.450
They will present their reports,
take some questions.

08:38.452 --> 08:40.818
Then it's the
independent evaluator.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.988
His name is Walter Walker.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.656
A friend, really nice guy.

08:44.658 --> 08:45.957
Then it's your turn.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.859
Then I go home?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.194
Then you go home.

08:49.996 --> 08:52.130
Carrie, it's time.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.133
Okay.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.835
Oh, don't forget
to tell the board

08:56.837 --> 08:58.069
how grateful you are

08:58.071 --> 08:59.571
for all of their help
in your recovery.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.406
Makes them feel like
they made a real difference.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.974
Yeah, it always gets them.

09:03.976 --> 09:06.711
So, thank-yous all around.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.914
Yeah, I can do that.

09:19.692 --> 09:21.927
Good morning, Abby.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.213
Where's my dad and sister?

09:42.215 --> 09:43.748
They should be here by now.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.784
I don't know.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.018
All rise.

09:48.554 --> 09:50.522
For the Sixth Circuit
of the Commonwealth of Virginia,

09:50.524 --> 09:52.591
the Honorable
Special Justice Robert Strauss.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.594
Please be seated.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.764
Matter of Carrie Mathison.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.367
Why don't we start
with you, Dr. Maloney?

10:02.369 --> 10:04.069
I understand
there's been an issue

10:04.071 --> 10:05.270
with the patient's medication.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.605
There was, Your Honor.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.073
I'm pleased to say
it's been resolved.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.307
Explain.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.642
I titrated her lithium dose

10:10.644 --> 10:12.711
in daily increments
of 600 milligrams

10:12.713 --> 10:14.312
until a total
daily dosage of 1,800...

10:14.314 --> 10:15.780
Carrie participates
in daily group sessions

10:15.782 --> 10:18.550
and craft activities
enthusiastically.

10:18.552 --> 10:19.985
She's demonstrated
a real talent in ceramics.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.053
She's been a pleasure
to have on the ward,

10:22.055 --> 10:23.555
volunteering
to deliver food trays,

10:23.557 --> 10:25.290
setting a good example
for her fellow patients.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.093
And it is my opinion
as an independent evaluator

10:28.095 --> 10:29.494
that the patient Carrie Mathison

10:29.496 --> 10:32.063
meets all the criteria
for discharge today,

10:32.065 --> 10:33.965
with the one proviso

10:33.967 --> 10:36.301
that she continue therapy
as an outpatient.

10:37.436 --> 10:38.570
What do you
say, Ms. Mathison?

10:38.572 --> 10:40.839
Do you feel well enough
to go home today?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.007
Yes, I do.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.141
And where is home?

10:43.143 --> 10:44.442
I live in Adams Morgan.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.144
Alone?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.279
Yes, but my dad and sister
are a quick 15-minute drive away

10:48.281 --> 10:50.015
and we see each other
all the time.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.316
They were scheduled

10:51.318 --> 10:52.984
to make an appearance today,
were they not?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.686
I talked with
Carrie's father yesterday.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.187
They said they would be.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.289
If my dad says he's coming,
he'll be here.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.159
He's probably stuck in traffic.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.429
Thank you, Ms. Mathison.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.931
The members of this committee
will now confer

11:06.933 --> 11:08.833
and come to a determination.

11:13.372 --> 11:15.674
Oh, and I want to thank
everybody here

11:15.676 --> 11:17.442
for helping me.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.978
I'm forever grateful.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.080
This shouldn't take too long.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.467
Go!

12:29.014 --> 12:30.348
Mr. Crosby?

12:30.350 --> 12:32.050
Want to come with me?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.830
Ladies?

13:00.246 --> 13:02.480
Please, sit.

13:05.651 --> 13:08.386
Ms. Mathison, I'm afraid
I can't approve your release

13:08.388 --> 13:09.654
from this facility today.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.256
- What?
- Un-fucking-believable.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.258
I don't understand, Your Honor.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.393
I've just been handed a writ
from the Justice Department.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.061
Saying what?

13:17.063 --> 13:18.663
That your client, in
her current state of mind,

13:18.665 --> 13:20.231
poses a threat
to national security.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.767
Her current state of
mind is excellent.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.569
Four mental health
care professionals

13:24.571 --> 13:25.837
just testified to that fact.

13:25.839 --> 13:29.641
The Government's worried
she'll disclose classified information.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.643
Isn't that what got her
into trouble in the first place?

13:31.645 --> 13:33.244
Violating Federal secrecy laws?

13:33.246 --> 13:35.647
That was over a month ago,
when she was off her meds.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.448
And I'm inclined to agree
with you, Counselor,

13:37.450 --> 13:38.917
but Ms. Mathison signed away

13:38.919 --> 13:40.618
some of her Constitutional
protections

13:40.620 --> 13:42.587
when she went
to work for the CIA.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.955
Is that true?

13:43.957 --> 13:45.957
Life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness,

13:45.959 --> 13:47.659
among others.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.928
Well, do we at least have
the right to appeal?

13:51.096 --> 13:52.463
Frankly, I don't know.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.432
What do you
mean, you don't know?

13:54.434 --> 13:57.302
This is a new one
for me, too, Counselor.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.038
Ms. Mathison, I am sorry.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.106
But you've been designated
a security risk.

14:02.108 --> 14:04.509
My hands are tied.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.344
Ms. Mathison?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.046
I'm gonna have
to take you upstairs now.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.481
I need a few minutes
with my client.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.951
Carrie, I am going
straight from here

14:12.953 --> 14:15.220
to the Circuit Court
to file an emergency appeal.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.621
You're wasting your time.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.555
You don't know that.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.023
Yeah, I do.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.658
Did you see the guy
in the hallway

14:20.660 --> 14:22.427
right before we went back
into the hearing room?

14:23.495 --> 14:24.462
No. Who was he?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.164
Dar Adal.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.299
He's the former head of a
group inside the Agency

14:28.301 --> 14:30.368
nobody likes to talk about.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.803
If he wants to keep me in here,

14:31.805 --> 14:34.072
then I'm not getting
out any time soon.

14:35.641 --> 14:36.975
I need your phone.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.910
You know I can't do that.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.411
I just want to call my dad,

14:40.413 --> 14:42.814
make sure he and
my sister are okay.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.219
Make it quick.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.060
Ah, excuse me.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.863
God, I hate these things.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.064
Yeah. Hello.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.366
Where were you guys?

15:01.368 --> 15:02.767
What do you mean?

15:02.769 --> 15:04.502
You were supposed to be
at my hearing today.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.037
I thought it was canceled.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.605
Well, who told you that?

15:07.607 --> 15:09.908
I don't know, Maggie spoke
to somebody last night.

15:11.043 --> 15:12.277
Was it Saul?

15:12.279 --> 15:13.845
Uh, look, I don't know
who it was.

15:13.847 --> 15:16.414
And, um, I'm-I'm not
at home right now.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.750
Look, dad, I need you to do
something for me, okay?

15:18.752 --> 15:21.052
Saul's not talking
to me anymore, so you have to.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.553
What do you want me to tell him?

15:22.555 --> 15:24.622
Tell him that I give up.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.057
Tell him I...

15:26.059 --> 15:27.558
I can't stand another second
in this place.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.027
- I'm going out of my mind.
- Carrie.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.728
Dad, t-tell him
that I'll do

15:30.730 --> 15:31.863
whatever he wants,

15:31.865 --> 15:33.231
- just not this.
- Carrie, please.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.365
I could lose my job.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.433
Okay, I gotta go.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.201
Call Saul.
Tell him what I said.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.391
Perfect timing.

16:10.269 --> 16:11.903
Your nails have gotten long.

16:11.905 --> 16:13.705
We'll have to trim them later.

Who is it?

16:52.946 --> 16:54.512

My mom.

What the hell is that?

17:03.023 --> 17:04.222
Hey.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.455
They can catch us with the GPS.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.126
They're gonna catch us anyway.

17:08.127 --> 17:11.128

17:27.047 --> 17:28.479
Here.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.714
Let me.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.584
Hey, Dana, it's me, Mike.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.086
Your mom and I are a
little worried about you.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.355
Plus, she'd really like
her car back, so...

17:37.357 --> 17:39.157
Give us a call so we
know you're okay.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.191
"A little worried"?

17:40.193 --> 17:41.359
It's all I can do

17:41.361 --> 17:42.593
to keep from screaming
at the phone.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.462
Nothing's gonna
happen to her, Jess.

17:49.601 --> 17:51.269
Jessica.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.703
This is Martin and Lynn Carras,

17:52.705 --> 17:54.105
Leo's parents.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.506
Hello.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.341
Um, this is a friend
of mine, Mike Faber.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.509
Do we know anything yet?

17:58.511 --> 17:59.544
Not yet.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.611
It's early.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.013
Any idea where they might be?

18:02.015 --> 18:03.614
A friend's house,
favorite hangout?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.183
I've tried everybody
I could think of.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.451
Nobody's heard from her.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.719
All I know is that
she's in my car.

18:08.721 --> 18:09.720
It's an Outback. Blue.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.290
If you would just
report the car stolen,

18:12.292 --> 18:14.225
they could put out an
APB on her right now.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.094
She didn't steal it.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.795
She said she was going
to Trader Joe's.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.197
Well, she was lying.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.932
Obviously.

18:22.401 --> 18:24.035
Look, Mrs. Carras,

18:24.037 --> 18:26.304
I want to find them
as much as you do,

18:26.306 --> 18:28.206
and if there's anything
I can do to help...

18:28.208 --> 18:30.808
It's not an official
Missing Persons for 24 hours.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.443
The State Police
have a description,

18:32.445 --> 18:34.378
and they're aware that
Leo's a fugitive from here.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.947
A fugitive?

18:37.082 --> 18:38.416
Most of the time in
these situations,

18:38.418 --> 18:39.650
from my experience,

18:39.652 --> 18:41.285
kids show up after a few hours.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.920
They're out blowing
off some steam.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.155
It's hormones, young love...

18:44.157 --> 18:45.623
Come on, we've all been there.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.824
It's not hormones.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.993
He's under a bad influence.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.228
Excuse me?

18:50.230 --> 18:53.197
We know who you are, Mrs. Brody.

18:56.602 --> 18:58.236
Then you should know
that my daughter

18:58.238 --> 19:00.872
is not responsible
for what her father did.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.647
Your car for the Camry.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.816
Yeah, maybe you
throw in a little extra?

19:11.818 --> 19:13.184
I just put a whole
new transmission

19:13.186 --> 19:14.752
in that Camry.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.854
It'll go another
100,000, no problem.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.590
That Outback?
What, maybe another

19:19.592 --> 19:21.092
20,000, it blows a rod?

19:21.094 --> 19:22.860
Yeah, but the Outback's
worth more in parts

19:22.862 --> 19:24.829
than a dozen new transmissions
in that Camry.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.197
This car of yours hot?

19:26.199 --> 19:27.632
Yeah.

19:27.634 --> 19:28.766
We just carjacked it.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.102
We're natural born killers.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.672
Do I know you from someplace?

19:35.440 --> 19:37.041
I don't think so.

19:37.043 --> 19:40.444
Uh, 200 bucks, it's a deal?

19:40.446 --> 19:42.680
What do you say, Aurelio?

19:45.984 --> 19:47.852
Is there a problem here?

19:48.787 --> 19:50.521
You want to trade,

19:50.523 --> 19:52.290
it's car for car.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.692
None of this
"$200 extra" bullshit.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.227
Well, we can just
go down the street.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.528
I know you.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.532
Deal.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.768
Let's go.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.815
Carrie?

20:17.817 --> 20:18.983
You just gonna lie there,

20:18.985 --> 20:20.818
or are you gonna get packed?

20:21.687 --> 20:23.854
What?

20:23.856 --> 20:26.424
You're out.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.092
Carrie, you are out.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.527
I'm out?

20:29.529 --> 20:33.364
By emergency order
of the Sixth Circuit Court of Maryland.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.732
I can go?

20:34.734 --> 20:35.933
Yeah.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.868
How the hell did that happen?

20:37.870 --> 20:39.337
Who cares?

20:39.339 --> 20:41.205
Start packing.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.907
Go.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.391
Don't be alarmed.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.728
I apologize for the intrusion.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.729
You.

21:38.731 --> 21:39.997
I should have known.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.565
Get the fuck out of my house.

21:41.567 --> 21:42.833
Just hear me out.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.602
- I told you before, no.
- We went to a lot

21:44.604 --> 21:47.238
of trouble to get you out
of that hospital.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.906
You can give me two minutes.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.409
If I had known, I would have
stayed in the hospital.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.977
I doubt that.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.246
But the furlough's only good
for 24 hours anyway.

21:55.248 --> 21:56.447
So...

21:56.449 --> 21:59.083
How did you arrange my release?

21:59.085 --> 22:01.252
A judge we know,
who, by the way,

22:01.254 --> 22:03.821
is more than willing
to make it permanent.

22:05.257 --> 22:06.757
In exchange for...?

22:06.759 --> 22:09.160
A sit-down with one
of the partners in the firm.

22:10.462 --> 22:12.163
That's all?

22:12.165 --> 22:14.031
Nothing's that easy.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.466
You're probably right,

22:15.468 --> 22:17.468
but that's above my pay grade.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.837
My job is to get you
to the meeting.

22:21.506 --> 22:22.707
Do I have a choice?

22:22.709 --> 22:23.874
Why not at least listen

22:23.876 --> 22:25.309
to what the man has to say?

22:25.311 --> 22:27.011
What have you got to lose?

22:31.883 --> 22:33.617
When's this meeting
supposed to happen?

22:33.619 --> 22:34.618
Tomorrow.

22:34.620 --> 22:35.553
8:00 AM.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.855
I can pick you up here.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.693
Okay, then.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.695
Okay what?

22:45.497 --> 22:47.698
I'll sit down with him.

22:49.301 --> 22:50.868
Good.

22:52.671 --> 22:54.905
I'll see you in the morning.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.556
Hey, Helen.

23:45.558 --> 23:46.924
Have you seen my car?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.559
Your car?
What do you mean?

23:48.561 --> 23:51.362
It's gone.

23:51.364 --> 23:53.130
That's strange.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.266
I haven't seen it in days.

24:00.372 --> 24:01.906
Which circuit court in Maryland?

24:01.908 --> 24:03.941
The sixth.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.476
Well, do they have jurisdiction

24:05.478 --> 24:06.710
over a County mental hospital

24:06.712 --> 24:08.879
in Arlington, Virginia?

24:08.881 --> 24:10.781
Okay, thanks.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.650
- Carrie?
- Yeah, I just heard.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.218
She's angry and vulnerable.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.153
Right now, she could be
saying anything to anybody.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.222
Do we know who
petitioned the judge

24:18.224 --> 24:19.290
to get her discharged?

24:19.292 --> 24:20.724
- No.
- Maybe it was her family.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.893
Not according to
her father, it wasn't.

24:24.229 --> 24:26.764
The Agency's still weak, Saul.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.566
It could die
of the common cold.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.734
And she's a full-blown
contagion.

24:33.939 --> 24:35.272
Find her.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.208
Get her off the street.

24:55.486 --> 24:56.891
_

25:03.268 --> 25:05.870
I'm afraid you can't
access your funds

25:05.872 --> 25:08.005
and deposit at this time.

25:09.207 --> 25:10.841
I don't understand.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.643
Your account's been frozen.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.812
- It's been what?
- Frozen.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.681
It says here, "By order of
the Department Of Justice."

25:17.683 --> 25:20.150
You under Federal
indictment or something?

25:20.152 --> 25:21.685
Not that I'm aware of.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.320
I'm also instructed to
confiscate any credit cards

25:23.322 --> 25:24.688
you may have in
your possession.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.323
Well, those you're not getting.

25:26.325 --> 25:28.225
Well, they won't do
you much good anyway.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.127
They've been canceled.

25:32.964 --> 25:35.399
I just need to get out of town
for a few days.

25:35.401 --> 25:36.634
I can't help you there.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.502
Come on, you know
I'm good for it.

25:38.504 --> 25:39.637
It's not about the money.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.971
What, then?

25:42.340 --> 25:43.374
My livelihood.

25:43.376 --> 25:44.875
You are radioactive, Carrie.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.677
I shouldn't even be talking
to you right now.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.546
I've got no one else to ask.

25:48.548 --> 25:50.047
Well, you've got to make things
right with Saul first.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.348
Well, I'm trying.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.183
He says that you went
to the press.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.987
Oh, Jesus Christ, Carrie.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.223
What are you trying to do--
get us all thrown in jail?

25:59.225 --> 26:01.492
No, I made a mistake.
It won't happen again.

26:01.494 --> 26:02.426
I should fucking hope not.

26:02.428 --> 26:03.694
What about your van?

26:03.696 --> 26:06.697
Can I at least borrow your van?

26:06.699 --> 26:08.399
No, you can't borrow my van.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.334
Just for the weekend,
to go up to the lake.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.335
Carrie, I can't.

26:11.337 --> 26:12.336
Virgil, please.

26:12.338 --> 26:15.406
I'm in trouble.

26:20.746 --> 26:21.946
Okay, fine.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.514
Great. Thank you.

26:23.516 --> 26:26.216
I just need it back
first thing Monday morning.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.451
Absolutely, you got it.

26:27.453 --> 26:29.286
When-when can I come by?

26:29.288 --> 26:31.021
I'm going to be in
and out all day.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.056
I'll leave the keys.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.425
Say hi to your mom for me.

26:34.427 --> 26:37.394
My mom?
What are you talking about?

26:37.396 --> 26:39.096
Virgil?

27:14.899 --> 27:18.068
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

27:18.070 --> 27:21.972
a stately pleasure dome decree

27:21.974 --> 27:24.274
where Alf The Sacred River ran

27:24.276 --> 27:28.178
through caverns
measureless to man

27:28.180 --> 27:30.381
down to a sunless sea.

27:32.517 --> 27:36.186
And then it goes on.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.455
It's kind of
beautiful, though, huh?

27:38.457 --> 27:41.959
Yeah, he would've liked it.

27:41.961 --> 27:43.927
You think so?

27:45.264 --> 27:48.265
He would've liked you.

27:53.204 --> 27:55.039
He was one year younger?

27:55.041 --> 27:56.940
11 months.

27:56.942 --> 27:59.109
Irish twins.

28:01.546 --> 28:03.213
Still.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.782
Guess it was my job.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.684
What was?

28:06.686 --> 28:08.452
To protect him.

28:08.454 --> 28:11.789
Isn't that what older brothers
are supposed to do?

28:13.324 --> 28:15.793
He killed himself.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.528
With a gun.

28:17.530 --> 28:21.498
It's hard to blame
anyone but him.

28:21.500 --> 28:25.135
Believe me, I should know.

28:38.183 --> 28:40.250
Leave it to my daughter
to fall in love

28:40.252 --> 28:42.319
on the psych ward.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.488
I know some guys
in the Arlington PD.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.023
I'll make some calls.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.691
Thanks.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.827
You okay?

28:49.829 --> 28:50.994
I just can't seem

28:50.996 --> 28:53.630
to do one thing right anymore.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.737
Hey, they were the
ones who were rude.

29:02.607 --> 29:04.608
It's no excuse.

29:04.610 --> 29:05.743
Come on.

29:05.745 --> 29:07.778
You're way too nice.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.780
No.

29:09.782 --> 29:12.049
I just almost lost Dana.

29:12.051 --> 29:14.585
So I know how they must feel.

29:17.188 --> 29:20.090
I should've just let you move
in here like you wanted to.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.225
Jess...

29:21.227 --> 29:22.426
You were always
so good with her.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.061
So much better than me.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.930
I'm not her mother.

29:31.102 --> 29:33.403
It was Brody
who broke her heart.

29:37.075 --> 29:39.743
I could kill him, Mike.

29:39.745 --> 29:43.113
I swear to God, I could.

30:00.231 --> 30:02.399
Can you guess?

30:02.401 --> 30:06.069
It's where your
dad was stationed.

30:06.071 --> 30:08.305
And?

30:09.407 --> 30:11.575
And... I don't know.

30:14.512 --> 30:16.246
Right there.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.981
Where those buses are.

30:17.983 --> 30:20.517
There was a long line of them.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.953
I was over there.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.354
The other side of
the parking lot

30:24.356 --> 30:27.157
with Chris and my mom

30:27.159 --> 30:29.393
and all the other families.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.697
Chris was so freaked-out.

30:33.699 --> 30:37.534
He wouldn't let go of my hand.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.837
You know, everybody was hugging

30:39.839 --> 30:43.207
and crying all around us.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.776
The day your dad
deployed for Iraq.

30:50.315 --> 30:52.916
There was
a Marine band playing.

30:54.986 --> 30:57.020
And when my dad walked out

30:57.022 --> 30:59.456
with all the other guys
from his battalion,

30:59.458 --> 31:02.893
you could tell
that he was excited.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.530
He wanted to go.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.402
He was some kind of sniper
or something, right?

31:14.172 --> 31:16.039
Yeah.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.411
How old were you?

31:23.381 --> 31:25.616
Eight.

31:26.584 --> 31:28.952
Fuck.

31:31.322 --> 31:33.557
But that's not why we're here.

31:35.660 --> 31:38.495
We're here...

31:38.497 --> 31:41.431
because this is
where it happened.

31:41.433 --> 31:45.168
The last true statement
he ever said to me.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.504
Which was?

31:47.506 --> 31:49.740
"Good-bye."

31:54.712 --> 31:57.848
Everything after that was a lie.

32:37.422 --> 32:38.889
Hello.

32:38.891 --> 32:40.424
Remember me?

32:40.426 --> 32:43.060
You're kind of hard to forget.

32:43.062 --> 32:46.430
Listen, I know this
is awkward, but, um...

32:46.432 --> 32:48.598
I kind of need a place to stay.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.936
Probably I should've
called first.

32:52.938 --> 32:54.938
Probably.

32:54.940 --> 32:58.475
Uh, but it's just for the night.

32:59.978 --> 33:04.147
Well, I got exactly
one couch and one bed.

33:04.949 --> 33:07.184
Bed's cool with me.

33:08.086 --> 33:10.320
Come on in.

34:50.855 --> 34:52.255
So it is him.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.590
Javadi.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.792
That's him,
third from the right.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.794
Jesus, he's gotten old.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.063
Standing next to him
is Edgar Cedeño.

35:00.065 --> 35:02.599
The banker we targeted
in last month's mission.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.068
When was this photograph taken?

35:05.070 --> 35:06.436
2009.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.271
According to
passenger manifests,

35:08.273 --> 35:10.607
Javadi visited Venezuela
exactly twice.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.709
Once at the time
of this photograph

35:12.711 --> 35:14.644
and once in November 2003.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.780
To set up the deal
with Cedeño's bank.

35:16.782 --> 35:20.417
Each time traveling
under the name Nasser Hejazi.

35:20.419 --> 35:21.818
His alter ego.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.254
He couldn't resist the joke.

35:24.256 --> 35:27.057
Now it's gonna bury him.

35:27.059 --> 35:29.726
With your blessing, I'd like
to open an OFAC investigation

35:29.728 --> 35:31.094
into his majority
ownership position

35:31.096 --> 35:32.562
at the Del Paraiso
Football Club.

35:32.564 --> 35:33.797
No.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.065
Why not?

35:35.067 --> 35:36.399
Now's the time for patience.

35:36.401 --> 35:37.901
Don't force the pieces.

35:37.903 --> 35:38.902
Store them away.

35:38.904 --> 35:39.970
But we have him.

35:39.972 --> 35:43.306
He's embezzled over $45 million
from the Revolutionary Guard.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.008
They get wind of it, they'll
just put him up against a wall.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.076
- They'll shoot him.
- Good.

35:46.078 --> 35:47.277
No.

35:47.279 --> 35:49.246
It's of negative value.

35:49.248 --> 35:55.118
He's second-in-command
at the Intelligence Directorate, Fara.

35:55.120 --> 35:58.588
He ordered the attack
on this building.

36:00.791 --> 36:03.260
I need him in a room.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.329
You want to interrogate him?

36:06.331 --> 36:09.666
I want to rip him
down to the studs.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.168
I want the name of every agent

36:11.170 --> 36:13.370
he's ever run in
the United States.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.605
And I want to know
just how close

36:15.607 --> 36:18.508
the regime is
to a nuclear weapon.

36:39.130 --> 36:40.197
Ms. Mathison?

36:40.199 --> 36:41.665
Leland Bennett.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.366
What is this place?

36:43.368 --> 36:45.068
The firm keeps it for our more

36:45.070 --> 36:46.970
privacy-sensitive clients.

36:46.972 --> 36:49.406
It's a pleasure to meet you.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.908
I tried to tell
your colleague Mr., um...

36:51.910 --> 36:52.976
Franklin.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.311
Mr. Franklin, uh...

36:54.313 --> 36:55.312
You're wasting your time.

36:55.314 --> 36:56.713
Well, how do you know that

36:56.715 --> 36:58.181
when you haven't heard
our proposal yet?

36:58.183 --> 36:59.416
I'm not for sale.

36:59.418 --> 37:01.384
Well, we're not
trying to buy you.

37:01.986 --> 37:03.653
Really.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.388
And no one's going to
ask you to do anything

37:05.390 --> 37:06.556
you're too uncomfortable with.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.058
Well, I'm already uncomfortable.

37:08.060 --> 37:11.328
It's up to you to draw
the line you won't cross.

37:12.663 --> 37:16.233
For all I know,
you're FBI and this is a sting.

37:16.235 --> 37:18.668
What's so funny?

37:18.670 --> 37:20.437
You have an active imagination.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.706
Well, somebody shut down my bank
account and repossessed my car.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.674
Your own Agency did that to you.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.576
Yeah, that's my point.
I'm not going to jail.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.246
It seems to me you're
already there.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.751
There are no recording devices
or cameras in this room,

37:34.753 --> 37:37.020
if that's what you're
worried about.

37:37.022 --> 37:39.990
Would you like to step outside?

37:42.593 --> 37:44.628
Okay, I'm listening.

37:44.630 --> 37:48.131
Our firm has
longstanding relationships

37:48.133 --> 37:50.033
with several countries
in the Middle East.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.802
We lobby on their behalf,
quietly represent

37:52.804 --> 37:54.271
their interests here
in Washington.

37:54.273 --> 37:55.772
Yeah, I know how this works.

37:55.774 --> 37:59.109
So... what does
your client want?

37:59.111 --> 38:01.244
To pick your brain
from time to time.

38:01.246 --> 38:03.113
Put you on retainer, as it were.

38:03.115 --> 38:04.881
Pick my brain?

38:04.883 --> 38:07.250
On what subject?

38:07.252 --> 38:08.885
Your area of expertise.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.920
For example?

38:10.922 --> 38:13.223
For example, he recently lost
six business associates.

38:13.225 --> 38:14.891
Maybe you heard about it.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.728
So this is Iran
we're talking about.

38:18.730 --> 38:22.866
He'd like to know how those men
were identified and targeted.

38:26.437 --> 38:29.639
That line you mentioned--
we just crossed it.

38:29.641 --> 38:30.740
Ms. Mathison...

38:30.742 --> 38:31.941
No, I won't do it.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.344
Iran was behind
the Langley bombing.

38:34.346 --> 38:36.079
Which they carried
out in retaliation

38:36.081 --> 38:39.449
for Israeli air strikes on
their nuclear facilities.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.418
I reject the comparison.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.686
Why?

38:42.688 --> 38:44.854
It's one military
target for another.

38:44.856 --> 38:48.258
Iran takes great care in
its proportional response

38:48.260 --> 38:50.026
to acts of aggression.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.928
An airliner for an airliner,

38:51.930 --> 38:55.699
a Mossad agent for a physicist.

38:55.701 --> 38:58.268
Sounds like you've drunk
the Kool-Aid.

38:58.270 --> 38:59.669
I'm a professional.

38:59.671 --> 39:03.773
I'm paid to make arguments,
not wave a flag.

39:05.609 --> 39:07.177
Good-bye, Mr. Bennett.

39:07.179 --> 39:10.146
You'll be back in County
lockup by the end of the day.

39:10.148 --> 39:11.781
Put there by the
very institutions

39:11.783 --> 39:13.516
you're trying to protect.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.118
I'll take my chances.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.820
Well, you know how this works.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.054
You said so yourself.

39:18.056 --> 39:21.057
Meaning what?

39:21.059 --> 39:24.527
You familiar with the
term "Controversialize"?

39:25.629 --> 39:27.364
No.

39:27.366 --> 39:30.166
Well, that's what
they're doing to you.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.569
They're turning you
into the story.

39:32.571 --> 39:35.872
They started by leaking
your relationship

39:35.874 --> 39:37.207
with Congressman Brody.

39:37.209 --> 39:38.875
Next it was
Saul Berenson's testimony

39:38.877 --> 39:40.477
in front of the Senate
Select Committee,

39:40.479 --> 39:42.979
then they had you committed.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.914
Pretty soon, it's not a story

39:44.916 --> 39:47.250
about a terrorist attack
anymore or how the people meant

39:47.252 --> 39:49.185
to protect us screwed up.

39:49.187 --> 39:52.055
It's about you.

39:52.057 --> 39:55.058
It's about sex between
a bipolar CIA officer

39:55.060 --> 39:57.961
and her brainwashed boyfriend.

40:00.264 --> 40:01.931
I'm not a traitor.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.533
No.

40:03.535 --> 40:08.037
What you are is a liability
to a lot of people

40:08.039 --> 40:10.240
who've got a lot to lose.

40:12.109 --> 40:14.611
So far, they've kept your
name out of the press,

40:14.613 --> 40:16.846
but how long do you
think that's gonna last?

40:16.848 --> 40:18.014
And what happens then?

40:18.016 --> 40:19.282
I'll tell you what.

40:19.284 --> 40:21.918
You're destroyed.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.254
You're a pariah.

40:24.256 --> 40:26.022
And in six months or a year,

40:26.024 --> 40:27.857
if you haven't killed
yourself by then,

40:27.859 --> 40:29.726
they'll do it for you.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.428
You're naive
to think they won't.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.229
You'll slip in the shower

40:33.231 --> 40:36.065
or they'll force-feed you
lithium till your heart stops

40:36.067 --> 40:39.836
or they'll hang you on a
doorknob and call it suicide.

41:12.503 --> 41:15.305
Let us help you, Carrie.

41:17.074 --> 41:19.242
We're very good at it.

41:25.616 --> 41:27.617
You can keep me out
of the hospital?

41:27.619 --> 41:29.519
I can.

41:31.956 --> 41:33.356
I'm broke.

41:33.358 --> 41:36.359
I don't have a dime to my name.

41:36.361 --> 41:39.195
You'll be compensated
handsomely.

41:47.304 --> 41:48.638
Well, then,

41:48.640 --> 41:51.674
I never want to see you
again, Mr. Bennett.

41:53.978 --> 41:55.812
I will see your client...

41:55.814 --> 41:58.515
but only him
and only face-to-face.

41:58.517 --> 42:00.683
That could be a problem.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.018
His problem.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.320
And tell him I won't
name names, either.

42:04.322 --> 42:07.123
I won't betray
my people in the field.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.125
That's between you and him.

42:09.127 --> 42:11.594
No, that is non-negotiable.

42:13.964 --> 42:16.599
Okay.

42:20.304 --> 42:23.540
Think of it this way.

42:23.542 --> 42:26.075
Maybe you two can find
some common ground.

42:26.077 --> 42:28.011
Put the world right.

42:28.013 --> 42:30.046
Save us all.

42:32.016 --> 42:33.483
Fuck you.

42:33.485 --> 42:35.385
I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

42:35.387 --> 42:37.820
Yeah. Fuck you.

42:45.529 --> 42:48.097
Mr. Bennett wanted you
to have this as a show

42:48.099 --> 42:50.099
of good faith.

42:54.538 --> 42:56.172
How would he feel about me

42:56.174 --> 42:58.041
buying a plane ticket
to Southeast Asia

42:58.043 --> 42:59.909
and disappearing
into the jungle for a while?

42:59.911 --> 43:01.444
You might want to
consider a car trip

43:01.446 --> 43:02.545
to Atlantic City instead.

43:02.547 --> 43:04.681
Why's that?

43:04.683 --> 43:06.382
You're on the
TSA no-fly list

43:06.384 --> 43:08.751
and your passport's
no longer valid.

43:11.255 --> 43:13.690
Good to know. Thanks.

43:13.692 --> 43:15.792
Have a nice walk.

43:38.882 --> 43:40.083
Have you heard anything?

43:40.085 --> 43:42.118
No.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.721
What is it?

43:44.723 --> 43:47.624
This. A detective buddy
of mine got it for me.

43:47.626 --> 43:49.726
Leo wasn't in the rehab
facility for treatment.

43:49.728 --> 43:51.561
His parents made
a deal with the DA

43:51.563 --> 43:53.663
to keep him from being charged
with a homicide.

43:53.665 --> 43:55.298
What?

43:55.300 --> 43:57.166
Details are sketchy,
but somehow he managed

43:57.168 --> 43:58.968
to get his hands
on his father's gun.

43:58.970 --> 44:02.338
Maybe it was a suicide pact,
maybe it wasn't.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.073
Either way,
the brother ends up dead,

44:04.075 --> 44:07.810
and this Leo walks.

44:07.812 --> 44:10.380
Oh, God.

44:39.210 --> 44:40.376
Hey.

44:40.378 --> 44:41.511
Hey.

44:41.513 --> 44:43.613
What time is it?

44:43.615 --> 44:45.782
Who cares?

44:45.784 --> 44:49.252
I just want to stay
like this forever.

44:50.721 --> 44:55.792
You know, usually I wake up
and I feel so... strange.

44:57.327 --> 45:00.063
But today...

45:00.065 --> 45:02.131
This is just perfect.

45:13.343 --> 45:15.578
I never want to go back.

45:17.981 --> 45:19.782
Then we don't have to.

45:52.850 --> 45:54.517
Carrie.

45:55.886 --> 45:58.254
Saul.

45:59.289 --> 46:01.691
Give us a minute.

46:14.371 --> 46:15.605
What are you doing here?

46:15.607 --> 46:17.106
Don't worry, I wasn't followed.

46:17.108 --> 46:18.441
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

46:18.443 --> 46:19.909
I used every trick in the book.

46:19.911 --> 46:22.545
It took me over five hours
to get here.

46:24.582 --> 46:26.549
I'm all right.

46:35.425 --> 46:37.527
It worked, Saul.

46:38.595 --> 46:40.730
They picked me up this morning.

46:40.732 --> 46:43.466
Who did?

46:43.468 --> 46:45.568
A man named Franklin.

46:45.570 --> 46:47.637
He took me to a house
in Potomac,

46:47.639 --> 46:48.971
where I met
with Leland Bennett.

46:48.973 --> 46:50.006
The lawyer.

46:50.008 --> 46:51.140
Yes.

46:51.142 --> 46:53.242
What did he say?

46:53.244 --> 46:54.410
What did he say, Carrie?

46:54.412 --> 46:56.345
What were his exact words?

46:56.347 --> 47:01.517
He said his client recently lost
six business associates

47:01.519 --> 47:03.986
and would like to know
how those men were identified

47:03.988 --> 47:06.155
and targeted.

47:07.758 --> 47:09.692
Javadi.

47:09.694 --> 47:10.993
It has to be.

47:10.995 --> 47:12.628
Did you hold out for
a meeting in person?

47:12.630 --> 47:14.263
I did it just the way you said.

47:14.265 --> 47:16.432
I told Bennett the meeting
had to be face-to-face.

47:16.434 --> 47:17.667
And he went for it?

47:24.608 --> 47:27.210
You're an amazing person,
Carrie Mathison.

47:27.212 --> 47:28.845
Amazing.

47:31.882 --> 47:34.116
I don't know.

47:36.887 --> 47:41.057
You've been very, very brave.

47:48.065 --> 47:50.700
You should've gotten me out
of the hospital, Saul.

47:50.702 --> 47:53.569
You shouldn't have
left me in there.

48:07.084 --> 48:08.751
It's almost over.

48:08.753 --> 48:11.988
No, it's too hard.
I can't keep going.

48:11.990 --> 48:13.556
Yes, you can.

48:14.324 --> 48:16.292
Yes, you can.

48:19.029 --> 48:21.497
Come on in.

48:21.499 --> 48:25.334
Mira will make you
a nice cup of tea.

48:25.336 --> 48:27.270
Come.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.608
Here.

48:34.009 --> 48:35.212
Here.
