00:21.236 --> 00:22.771
Allen, are you okay?

00:22.838 --> 00:24.006
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:24.073 --> 00:25.774
Geez, I've been waiting for you.

00:25.841 --> 00:27.209
I'm so sorry, guys.

00:27.276 --> 00:29.178
Oh, I'm so glad you weren't killed.

00:29.244 --> 00:31.046
And it's not your
fault the bomb went off.

00:31.113 --> 00:32.514
It was your first bomb.

00:32.581 --> 00:35.617
Yes, Kay, there's clients
waiting for you here.

00:35.684 --> 00:37.052
You took forever at the hospital.

00:37.119 --> 00:38.954
They're, they're, they're piling up.

00:41.423 --> 00:42.892
Oh, you're back.

00:42.958 --> 00:44.927
We've settled everything.
We're getting a divorce.

00:44.994 --> 00:46.962
Oh, can you just give me a moment?

00:47.029 --> 00:48.907
We've decided to have
one last session with you,

00:48.931 --> 00:50.665
and if we can't resolve it, it's over.

00:50.732 --> 00:52.401
- Yes.
- Well, um, um...

00:52.467 --> 00:54.412
Could we just go into the
office and talk about this?

00:54.436 --> 00:55.470
Oh, there you are.

00:55.537 --> 00:57.172
We had a 10:00 appointment, remember?

00:57.239 --> 00:58.707
You said you'd fit us in.

00:58.773 --> 01:00.242
- It's an emergency.
- So sorry.

01:00.309 --> 01:01.910
- Lorna left me.
- Oh, no.

01:01.911 --> 01:03.431
Yeah, she, she walked out, left a note

01:03.478 --> 01:05.647
and, and I'm so upset!

01:05.714 --> 01:07.016
Well, we're gonna break up too

01:07.082 --> 01:09.018
unless there's a major change.

01:09.084 --> 01:11.420
But my wife already did.
I'm gonna kill myself.

01:11.486 --> 01:13.222
That's, come on, it's a lot of pain now

01:13.288 --> 01:15.090
but you don't kill yourself.

01:15.157 --> 01:17.492
No, if she's gone for
good, I'm gonna kill myself.

01:17.559 --> 01:19.628
She wants to be a professional hooker.

01:19.694 --> 01:21.230
She wants to be a hooker?

01:21.296 --> 01:23.999
Wow, I wish I was so lucky.

01:24.066 --> 01:25.467
Oh, thank you very much.

01:25.534 --> 01:27.236
Let's have a group session, come on.

01:27.302 --> 01:29.138
Have you guys met?

01:29.204 --> 01:30.764
No, not at all.

01:32.975 --> 01:34.176
Oh, my gosh.

01:34.243 --> 01:36.645
We came as soon as
we heard. How are you?

01:36.711 --> 01:38.056
Okay, you were probably right
behind my wife in the car.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.015
- Oh, goodness.
- I'm so sorry.

01:40.082 --> 01:41.951
Hi, Mom, I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:43.285 --> 01:44.562
Your mother and I were worried sick.

01:44.586 --> 01:46.956
He's fine. Kay? Come on out here.

01:47.022 --> 01:48.523
There's not a scratch on the kid.

01:48.590 --> 01:49.824
You call this fine?

01:49.959 --> 01:51.660
Well, you know he's, he's not dead.

01:51.726 --> 01:53.028
Well, how did it happen?

01:53.095 --> 01:55.464
It's obvious, a... a gas leak.

01:55.530 --> 01:56.465
In his bedroom?

01:56.531 --> 01:58.133
No, no, in the garage.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.170
We have methane and we're
built on a swamp here, so...

02:01.236 --> 02:02.537
And the house explodes?

02:02.604 --> 02:04.149
No, no, the house occasionally explodes.

02:04.173 --> 02:05.975
This time it was the garage.

02:06.008 --> 02:08.276
You get used to it if you're...

02:08.342 --> 02:09.979
We haven't seen you in so long.

02:10.044 --> 02:11.446
- So sorry.
- We were hoping

02:11.513 --> 02:13.058
we'd find you under
better circumstances.

02:13.082 --> 02:14.082
Oh, no, he's okay.

02:15.517 --> 02:17.719
We're so grateful that
you introduced them.

02:17.786 --> 02:19.188
Can we get back to our problems?

02:19.254 --> 02:20.789
He's called the lawyer now.

02:20.855 --> 02:22.891
Wait, Lorna got a lawyer too.

02:22.992 --> 02:25.227
Hey, Bernstein, that shyster!

02:25.294 --> 02:27.496
- He's always on TV. No...
- Listen, it's my fault.

02:27.562 --> 02:30.399
It's my fault you pay your
wife for sex, my fault.

02:30.465 --> 02:33.035
- Now, now...
- You pay your wife for sex?

02:33.102 --> 02:34.279
Listen, I'm gonna take poison.

02:34.303 --> 02:35.570
- No, you're not.
- Yes!

02:35.637 --> 02:37.472
Let's go in and talk this through.

02:37.539 --> 02:39.408
We can work this out.
We can work it out.

02:39.474 --> 02:41.910
Mom, Dad, I'm gonna be
perfectly honest with you.

02:42.011 --> 02:44.079
It wasn't gas, it was a bomb.

02:44.146 --> 02:45.714
- What was a bomb?
- It was a bomb.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.425
I was trying to make a
bomb. I screwed it up.

02:47.449 --> 02:48.850
- You were building a bomb?
- Yes.

02:48.917 --> 02:50.652
Why? I think I missed a beat here.

02:50.719 --> 02:52.263
I was making a bomb
and it, I don't know,

02:52.287 --> 02:53.822
the gunpowder, it went off.

02:53.888 --> 02:55.666
- Why were you making a bomb?
- To blow up something.

02:55.690 --> 02:57.026
What?

02:57.092 --> 02:59.261
The statue of Andrew
Jackson by the armory.

02:59.328 --> 03:00.429
Why?

03:00.495 --> 03:02.631
Well, what do you have
against Andrew Jackson?

03:02.697 --> 03:04.133
He was a slave owner.

03:04.199 --> 03:07.302
This was 150 years ago
when everybody had slaves.

03:07.369 --> 03:09.204
George Washington had slaves then.

03:09.271 --> 03:10.739
The guy was a military man,

03:10.805 --> 03:13.875
and this was meant to be
a protest against the war,

03:13.942 --> 03:16.145
against Vietnam, against all wars.

03:16.211 --> 03:18.047
Since when are you a pacifist?

03:18.080 --> 03:19.848
There are no slaves anymore.

03:19.914 --> 03:21.050
No?

03:21.116 --> 03:23.285
I think what Allen is implying

03:23.352 --> 03:25.520
is that there are wage slaves.

03:25.587 --> 03:27.055
Meaning what?

03:27.056 --> 03:30.325
Meaning that your firm, it
pays its employees the minimum,

03:30.392 --> 03:33.562
just enough to get by and
remain a permanent underclass.

03:33.628 --> 03:35.830
Are you accusing me of exploitation?

03:35.897 --> 03:37.432
Are you ever coming in here?

03:37.499 --> 03:41.303
My wife is walking up and
down Eighth Avenue in shorts!

03:41.370 --> 03:42.537
I asked you a question.

03:42.604 --> 03:44.406
Do you think I exploit my workers?

03:44.473 --> 03:46.074
If the shoe fits, wear it.

03:46.075 --> 03:47.742
You know, I say that with love.

03:47.809 --> 03:49.678
Oh, she says that,
if the shoe fits wear,

03:49.744 --> 03:51.113
it's her expression.

03:51.180 --> 03:55.083
Who? Not Ellie, not your fiancée.

03:55.084 --> 03:56.651
And where is she by the way?

03:56.718 --> 03:58.187
We want to meet her.

03:58.253 --> 04:01.190
I'm not so sure Ellie is
going to be my fiancée.

04:01.256 --> 04:04.126
What are you talking about?

04:04.193 --> 04:07.162
We put a deposit on the hall.

04:07.229 --> 04:10.865
We hired an orchestra, caterers,
we sent out invitations.

04:10.932 --> 04:12.967
Don't take this
personally, but we really do

04:13.102 --> 04:16.171
take advantage of our workers
but we don't, we don't know it

04:16.238 --> 04:19.641
because we live a
capitalistic existence.

04:19.708 --> 04:21.142
I earned every dime.

04:21.209 --> 04:22.211
I started poor.

04:22.277 --> 04:24.213
I worked from 14 on.

04:24.279 --> 04:25.880
Okay, okay, let's not hear about

04:25.947 --> 04:28.583
how you were delivering heavy
packages down on Wall Street

04:28.650 --> 04:31.320
and some broker gave
you a hot stock tip.

04:31.386 --> 04:32.887
Can I help it if it's true?

04:32.954 --> 04:35.457
"Buy California Fiber" she
whispered to an associate.

04:35.524 --> 04:37.992
I was within earshot, I borrowed $300.

04:38.127 --> 04:40.295
You stole $500.

04:40.362 --> 04:42.397
Borrowed, stole, everyone got paid back!

04:42.464 --> 04:45.167
You always idolized military might.

04:45.234 --> 04:46.701
I fought at Guadalcanal.

04:46.768 --> 04:48.803
I'm proud to say I've
got a Purple Heart.

04:48.870 --> 04:50.004
You know that reminds me.

04:50.139 --> 04:51.840
My blood work comes back today.

04:51.906 --> 04:54.142
Yeah, you got a Purple
Heart for being wounded

04:54.143 --> 04:55.753
while you were trying
to kill other young men.

04:55.777 --> 04:58.012
Young men with a different
color skin than yours.

04:58.147 --> 05:00.882
With yellow skin, and you
called them Japs and Nips

05:00.949 --> 05:03.017
and meanwhile, we're
dropping an atomic bomb

05:03.152 --> 05:07.021
on their country while
innocent Japanese-Americans

05:07.156 --> 05:10.392
here at home are being thrown
into concentration camps

05:10.459 --> 05:13.462
and their land is being
confiscated and stolen.

05:13.528 --> 05:15.564
If I had my life to live over,

05:15.630 --> 05:17.466
I would live a more committed life.

05:17.532 --> 05:20.535
I would have a more, a
more passionate existence.

05:20.602 --> 05:22.271
It's not passionate enough?

05:22.337 --> 05:24.606
The passion's gone out
of our marriage too.

05:24.673 --> 05:25.340
But not for me.

05:25.407 --> 05:27.242
Listen, I love Lorna.

05:27.309 --> 05:30.387
I even get along with
her pimp. Okay? So I...

05:30.412 --> 05:32.181
Now has the passion
gone out of our marriage?

05:32.214 --> 05:35.183
At least I don't charge you to screw me.

05:35.184 --> 05:36.418
Get them out of here.

05:36.485 --> 05:37.819
Meanwhile you were nearly killed!

05:37.886 --> 05:39.230
Well, you know, there's no statute of

05:39.254 --> 05:41.089
limitations on injustice.

05:41.190 --> 05:42.791
Listen, I love Lorna.

05:42.857 --> 05:44.493
No, no, I need help now.

05:44.559 --> 05:47.095
I'm suicidal. Why does no one care?

05:47.196 --> 05:48.730
- I do care.
- No, you don't care.

05:48.797 --> 05:50.599
Look, I do care. I care very much.

05:50.665 --> 05:51.942
Let's go in, we'll have our session,

05:51.966 --> 05:53.502
and we'll talk about it okay?

05:53.568 --> 05:55.280
- We had an appointment.
- I'm waiting for you here.

05:55.304 --> 05:58.380
- I'm waiting for you here.
- We're the ones who had an appointment.

05:58.773 --> 06:00.918
I'm going to go in with you,
and then we'll have a session.

06:00.942 --> 06:02.811
Just a second.

06:04.112 --> 06:07.216
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

06:07.249 --> 06:08.783
Let me reschedule you. Hello.

06:08.850 --> 06:11.553
I didn't expect you. Is this Thursday?

06:11.620 --> 06:13.788
- Hi, it is.
- I don't even know my own name.

06:13.855 --> 06:16.591
Come on in.

06:16.658 --> 06:17.926
In we go.

06:17.992 --> 06:19.628
This is the Brachmanns.

06:19.694 --> 06:23.698
Brachmanns, this is
my, my, my book club.

06:23.765 --> 06:24.866
How do you do?

06:24.933 --> 06:28.703
Oh, we, we, we finished
the book about Karl Marx

06:28.770 --> 06:31.806
and we also finished the little pamphlet

06:31.873 --> 06:33.408
about guerrilla warfare.

06:33.475 --> 06:36.745
And Lucy has become an
expert on hand-to-hand combat.

06:36.811 --> 06:39.113
And I learned how to take apart

06:39.248 --> 06:42.684
and reassemble an AK-47 blindfolded!

06:42.751 --> 06:44.553
- She did!
- Yeah, isn't that wonderful?

06:44.619 --> 06:46.054
My, my husband was so impressed.

06:46.120 --> 06:49.991
We found a guy who smuggles
them in from Russia.

06:50.058 --> 06:53.261
I read all about how to kill
a person with an ice pick

06:53.262 --> 06:54.663
without leaving a mark!

06:56.265 --> 06:58.400
- What is that vein, Rose?
- Jugular.

06:58.467 --> 07:00.602
Right, you stick the
ice pick in the jugular.

07:00.669 --> 07:02.337
Well, what kind of book club is this?

07:02.404 --> 07:03.872
Cultural.

07:03.938 --> 07:06.408
Chairman Mao says... an unarmed person

07:06.475 --> 07:09.444
is like a sheep in a forest of wolves.

07:09.511 --> 07:11.280
Chairman Mao, you're quoting Mao?

07:11.313 --> 07:12.714
You know, Mao, he also said that

07:12.781 --> 07:15.384
the laws of a nation are
written in the street.

07:15.450 --> 07:18.387
Karl Marx's biography was exhilarating.

07:18.453 --> 07:21.390
I love what he said
about the United States.

07:21.456 --> 07:24.293
"We're gonna spend
ourselves into destruction."

07:24.326 --> 07:26.361
You know that was actually Lenin.

07:26.428 --> 07:27.962
Oh, I always confuse the two.

07:28.029 --> 07:31.032
Which, which one had
the beard, Marx or Lenin?

07:31.099 --> 07:32.534
- Both!
- Both.

07:32.601 --> 07:34.135
And the little beard.

07:34.202 --> 07:35.880
Let's go into the dining
room, into the dining room,

07:35.904 --> 07:38.340
and then we'll have
our meeting in there.

07:38.407 --> 07:41.109
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you, very nice.

07:55.189 --> 07:56.658
- Hello.
- Oh, Ellie.

07:56.725 --> 07:58.793
Hi. Oh, these are my parents.

07:58.860 --> 08:00.629
Oh, Judy, yes, Judy. You must be Lou.

08:00.695 --> 08:02.331
- I'm Lou. Yes.
- Oh, good.

08:02.397 --> 08:04.098
Allen, look who's here!

08:06.435 --> 08:09.971
- Oh, my goodness, how are you?
- Oh my God!

08:10.038 --> 08:12.240
- What happened to you?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

08:12.341 --> 08:13.751
- Look, they took me to the...
- Nice to finally meet you.

08:13.775 --> 08:15.477
Ellie, Ellie, Ellie,
these are my parents.

08:15.544 --> 08:17.912
- Hello, hi, hi, I'm Ellie.
- Yes, yes.

08:17.979 --> 08:21.516
Oh, she's as beautiful
as you said she was.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.428
- That's very sweet of you.
- Hi, I'm Allen's mother.

08:23.452 --> 08:25.454
This is his dad. You can call me Mom.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.555
And me Dad.

08:27.756 --> 08:30.592
We, we heard about the gas leak.

08:30.659 --> 08:31.993
No, no, there was no gas leak.

08:32.059 --> 08:32.994
It was a bomb.

08:33.061 --> 08:34.496
- A bomb?
- What?

08:34.563 --> 08:36.164
Who bombed you?

08:36.230 --> 08:39.000
One of those crazy underground
radical idiots, right?

08:39.067 --> 08:40.168
No, he's joking.

08:40.234 --> 08:42.504
Can I offer anyone an aperitif?

08:42.571 --> 08:44.439
- I'm your host. How are you?
- How do you do?

08:44.506 --> 08:45.683
- How do you do?
- Hello, nice to meet you.

08:45.707 --> 08:47.442
This is a fun group, I hope.

08:47.509 --> 08:48.577
Yes, yes.

08:48.643 --> 08:49.578
Kay?

08:49.644 --> 08:50.945
Kay!

08:51.012 --> 08:52.113
I could use a scotch.

08:52.180 --> 08:54.182
And, oh, and who are you?

08:54.248 --> 08:55.384
My wife left me.

08:55.450 --> 08:57.686
We got into a major fight

08:57.752 --> 08:59.954
because I wouldn't pay her
enough to go to bed with me

09:00.021 --> 09:03.291
and now she's on the
West Side stopping cars.

09:03.392 --> 09:04.693
I'm, I need help now!

09:04.759 --> 09:06.495
- Yes.
- I, yeah.

09:06.561 --> 09:08.497
- This is my patient.
- No, I'm not your patient.

09:08.563 --> 09:10.499
I'm a client and I'm not your patient.

09:10.565 --> 09:11.866
Are you never coming back in?

09:11.933 --> 09:14.002
The more we wait, the more we disagree.

09:14.068 --> 09:15.404
Let's get this over with.

09:15.470 --> 09:17.205
I hope you all brought
some paper and pens

09:17.271 --> 09:20.775
'cause Rose is teaching
us how to forge passports.

09:20.842 --> 09:23.411
Why do you need to learn
how to forge passports?

09:23.412 --> 09:25.046
What on earth for?

09:25.113 --> 09:26.515
Are you the girl's mother?

09:26.581 --> 09:28.450
I am. How do you do? Judy. And you are?

09:28.517 --> 09:30.051
Rita Needleman.

09:30.118 --> 09:33.988
But you can call me by my
new name, Rita Mohammed.

09:34.055 --> 09:36.425
Girls, come on in, girls!

09:36.458 --> 09:38.627
Girls, come and meet all these people.

09:38.693 --> 09:43.097
Hi, hi, hi.

09:43.164 --> 09:44.833
Hello.

09:44.899 --> 09:46.979
I don't think my passport
came out very well.

09:51.940 --> 09:54.543
All right, look, everybody,
look, once and for all,

09:54.609 --> 09:56.511
there was never a gas leak.

09:56.578 --> 09:59.313
I was making a bomb and
it blew up in my face.

09:59.448 --> 10:01.583
I'm sorry, did you just
say you were making a bomb?

10:01.650 --> 10:03.552
Yes, I was making a bomb.

10:03.618 --> 10:06.354
I was making a bomb to
strike a blow for civil rights

10:06.421 --> 10:08.890
and make an anti-war
statement in one gesture.

10:11.493 --> 10:13.428
Eve, our son is having
a mental breakdown.

10:13.495 --> 10:14.496
I saw it coming on.

10:14.563 --> 10:16.565
I think we need to reassess.

10:16.631 --> 10:19.367
Excuse me.

10:19.434 --> 10:20.569
You were making a bomb?

10:20.635 --> 10:22.771
Is this, uh, some sort of club?

10:22.837 --> 10:25.273
The first thing to do in
setting up a new government

10:25.339 --> 10:27.509
is to take control of the press

10:27.576 --> 10:29.878
and the radio and TV stations.

10:29.944 --> 10:31.546
- Absolutely.
- That's right.

10:31.613 --> 10:33.181
Naturally, for a short period of time

10:33.247 --> 10:35.917
temporarily there will be
suspension of civil liberties.

10:44.759 --> 10:46.895
Actually, I, um, uh,

10:46.961 --> 10:50.031
I, I have an announcement to make too.

10:51.199 --> 10:52.634
I'm pregnant.

10:52.701 --> 10:54.469
- What?
- What?

10:54.536 --> 10:56.080
I don't understand. You're pregnant?

10:56.104 --> 10:57.371
I'm pregnant.

10:57.438 --> 10:58.783
I think I'm gonna pass out.

10:58.807 --> 11:02.043
- How did that happen?
- The usual way.

11:02.110 --> 11:03.821
I mean I hope the bomb
didn't affect your memory.

11:03.845 --> 11:05.213
You're pregnant.

11:05.279 --> 11:07.716
Chairman Mao say... death's certain,

11:07.782 --> 11:09.584
life unpredictable.

11:09.651 --> 11:11.553
He got that from Charlie Chan.

11:11.620 --> 11:12.954
Congratulations, Allen.

11:13.021 --> 11:16.157
Thank you, it's, but, wait, I mean...

11:16.224 --> 11:18.560
No it's okay. It's, it's okay.

11:18.627 --> 11:21.062
If, if you want to go to Cuba and work

11:21.129 --> 11:22.530
for Fidel's revolution
I'll come with you.

11:22.531 --> 11:23.965
We can raise the baby there.

11:24.032 --> 11:26.535
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What are you talking about?

11:26.601 --> 11:30.004
You would raise our
grandson as a communist?

11:30.071 --> 11:33.307
These are all just labels, aren't they?

11:33.374 --> 11:36.377
I mean we are all just human beings.

11:36.444 --> 11:37.779
I don't believe in abortion.

11:37.846 --> 11:39.981
Who said anything about abortion?

11:40.048 --> 11:42.316
My grandson will never be a commie.

11:42.383 --> 11:45.119
Well, we all know how you
feel. Better dead than red.

11:45.186 --> 11:47.355
Don't you think this
calls for champagne?

11:47.421 --> 11:48.557
God, you're pregnant.

11:48.590 --> 11:49.423
I think some champagne would be nice.

11:49.558 --> 11:50.725
Yeah!

11:50.792 --> 11:53.194
I'm expecting the
Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

11:53.261 --> 11:54.796
I'll be right back.

11:57.766 --> 11:59.568
- Who are you?
- Where's Lenny?

11:59.601 --> 12:01.402
What?

12:01.469 --> 12:02.613
Wait a minute, what, who are you guys?

12:02.637 --> 12:04.138
Lenny said to meet her here.

12:04.205 --> 12:05.373
We have something for her.

12:05.439 --> 12:07.609
Wait, what have you got for her?

12:07.676 --> 12:09.177
She needs this to get to Cuba.

12:09.243 --> 12:10.579
The money for the pilot.

12:10.645 --> 12:12.156
And some letters she
needs to give to Fidel.

12:12.180 --> 12:13.181
Fidel?

12:13.247 --> 12:15.750
My God, did anyone see you come here?

12:15.817 --> 12:17.351
Why is everybody going to Cuba?

12:17.418 --> 12:18.820
Don't they know it's forbidden?

12:18.887 --> 12:21.590
Man, the police been
following us for days now.

12:21.656 --> 12:22.816
I think we finally lost them.

12:24.292 --> 12:25.760
The police have been following them.

12:25.827 --> 12:27.061
Did you hear this guy?

12:27.128 --> 12:29.063
The police have been
following them, they...

12:29.130 --> 12:32.600
Is something illegal going on here?

12:32.601 --> 12:34.636
That's a very good question you ask.

12:34.703 --> 12:36.270
Oh, look, girls!

12:37.606 --> 12:39.473
Are, are you Black Panthers?

12:39.608 --> 12:41.610
Girls, real Black Panthers!

12:41.643 --> 12:44.412
We are with the Constitutional
Liberation Party.

12:44.478 --> 12:45.680
How exciting.

12:45.747 --> 12:48.216
Which one of you is Abbie Hoffman?

12:48.282 --> 12:50.218
Abbie Hoffman is white.

12:50.284 --> 12:51.620
Are there White Panthers?

12:51.653 --> 12:55.423
In India, Rose Epstein
saw a white tiger.

12:55.489 --> 12:58.159
No, I think you're thinking
of the Detroit Tigers.

12:58.226 --> 12:59.527
Man, what did we get into here?

12:59.628 --> 13:00.829
Where's Lenny?

13:00.895 --> 13:03.197
These people commit criminal acts.

13:03.264 --> 13:05.934
No, these people are freedom fighters.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.736
Right.

13:07.802 --> 13:10.672
You know, Chairman Mao said
that one man's criminal

13:10.739 --> 13:11.916
is another man's freedom fighter.

13:11.940 --> 13:13.474
- That's right.
- Thank you.

13:13.541 --> 13:14.943
Wait, wait, you know what?

13:15.009 --> 13:17.178
I'd like to get you
all something to eat.

13:19.013 --> 13:20.357
All right, everybody,
stay calm all right?

13:20.381 --> 13:21.883
We don't need no fireworks.

13:21.950 --> 13:25.153
No, we should, we should
appear like a normal group.

13:26.054 --> 13:27.388
I don't understand, Ellie.

13:27.455 --> 13:29.166
How can you be serious
about living in Cuba?

13:29.190 --> 13:30.859
Because I love you, and you're gonna

13:30.925 --> 13:32.827
be the father of our child.

13:32.894 --> 13:34.438
Congratulations!

13:34.462 --> 13:35.997
Thank you.

13:36.064 --> 13:38.299
And you said that Havana was romantic.

13:38.366 --> 13:41.770
That there are palm trees and beaches

13:41.836 --> 13:45.674
and anything is possible
if you're in love.

13:45.740 --> 13:47.809
Unless you're in love with someone else.

13:47.876 --> 13:50.912
He's not. He's not in love with me.

13:50.979 --> 13:53.181
He wouldn't last a weekend in Cuba.

13:53.247 --> 13:55.784
He's just in love with what I symbolize.

13:55.850 --> 13:58.319
His inner radical has come
out, which is a step up.

13:58.386 --> 13:59.688
I'm sorry, Allen.

13:59.754 --> 14:02.256
She's that woman on TV.

14:02.323 --> 14:04.158
Oh, my God, that's the escaped fugitive!

14:06.294 --> 14:08.262
For God's sake, Sid, answer the door.

14:08.329 --> 14:12.734
Oh, yes, that's right,
could be the Marx brothers.

14:12.801 --> 14:14.202
We're from the gas company.

14:14.268 --> 14:16.370
We understand there
was a gas leak reported.

14:16.437 --> 14:18.707
No, no, that was a while ago.

14:18.740 --> 14:19.908
It's okay.

14:19.974 --> 14:21.710
- Who are you two?
- Gas company.

14:21.776 --> 14:23.253
How do we know you're
not undercover agents?

14:23.277 --> 14:24.412
For who?

14:24.478 --> 14:25.714
The FBI.

14:25.747 --> 14:27.315
We're here to check a gas leak.

14:27.381 --> 14:28.717
Who are you?

14:28.783 --> 14:30.719
They're members of the Detroit Tigers.

14:30.785 --> 14:32.854
Really? Baseball players.

14:32.921 --> 14:36.224
The gas is, the, the,
the basement's over there.

14:37.792 --> 14:40.061
I need to get to this
spot just right up here.

14:40.128 --> 14:41.830
The roads are not safe.

14:41.896 --> 14:43.140
She's gonna have to get out

14:43.164 --> 14:44.404
in the trunk of somebody's car.

14:44.465 --> 14:45.834
Somebody's gotta drive her.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.636
- You two guys can take her.
- Are you kidding?

14:48.737 --> 14:51.015
We'll be stopped and searched
by every trooper on the highway.

14:51.039 --> 14:52.540
- I'll drive her.
- No, you will not.

14:52.606 --> 14:53.842
You will not!

14:53.908 --> 14:55.744
No one in this house is going to help

14:55.810 --> 14:57.611
a wanted criminal escape.

14:57.746 --> 14:59.890
- Are you crazy?
- No, look, I said I'm gonna take her.

14:59.914 --> 15:01.582
- I'm gonna take her.
- I said no.

15:01.649 --> 15:03.317
Let's go.

15:03.384 --> 15:05.329
If you don't get there on time,
he'll get nervous and leave.

15:05.353 --> 15:06.755
I'll drive you!

15:06.788 --> 15:08.489
You can't, Helen. With your eyesight

15:08.556 --> 15:10.825
and sense of direction,
you'll wind up in Brooklyn.

15:10.892 --> 15:13.194
But she's a sister revolutionary.

15:13.261 --> 15:14.963
Listen, if you miss this plane we can't

15:15.029 --> 15:16.798
set up an escape for another month.

15:16.865 --> 15:19.767
You could wind up stuck
here God knows how long.

15:19.768 --> 15:20.835
I'll take her.

15:20.902 --> 15:22.771
No, yes, I'm gonna take you.

15:22.837 --> 15:24.305
Are you crazy? You'll drive her?

15:24.372 --> 15:26.140
She's not gonna be here another month

15:26.207 --> 15:28.776
because she eats my sturgeon,
she eats my navel oranges.

15:28.777 --> 15:30.311
She's out, I want her out.

15:30.378 --> 15:32.781
Hey, you don't have a gas
line that extends out...

15:32.814 --> 15:34.515
Hey, aren't you the...

15:34.582 --> 15:36.885
You're that escaped criminal
the FBI's looking for.

15:36.951 --> 15:38.820
Okay, you two, up against that wall.

15:38.887 --> 15:40.788
Go up against the wall. You'll be fine.

15:40.789 --> 15:42.156
Just stay against the wall.

15:42.223 --> 15:45.393
Let's go, Lenny. Time's running out.

15:45.459 --> 15:47.528
- Wish me luck.
- Don't want to miss your plane.

15:47.595 --> 15:49.206
I know what you're
thinking. You're thinking

15:49.230 --> 15:52.200
you were never prouder
of me in this moment.

15:52.266 --> 15:55.036
Hand signal, please.
You're a terrible driver.

15:55.103 --> 15:56.871
She's right, she's right.

16:03.644 --> 16:05.313
Okay, get into the trunk.

16:05.379 --> 16:06.714
- What?
- Get into the trunk.

16:06.815 --> 16:08.549
You want me to get in the trunk?

16:08.616 --> 16:10.194
Yeah, unless you want me
to put you under the hood.

16:10.218 --> 16:12.954
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Get into the trunk.

16:13.955 --> 16:15.623
Try and get comfortable.

16:15.689 --> 16:17.434
It's a little tight in
there, but you'll make it.

16:17.458 --> 16:18.726
Oh, God.

16:33.674 --> 16:35.877
I need help now, I need help.

16:47.388 --> 16:49.723
Would you have really
gone to Cuba with me?

16:49.858 --> 16:51.325
I said I loved you.

16:51.392 --> 16:53.895
And you do know that,
even after we're married

16:53.962 --> 16:56.130
I still plan to be
very active in helping

16:56.197 --> 16:58.732
our country reach its full potential?

16:58.867 --> 17:01.335
That's fine, but no
more explosions okay?

17:01.402 --> 17:02.871
No, no, no.

17:02.904 --> 17:05.874
Now that I'm going to be a father.

17:05.906 --> 17:07.375
And we can move to San Diego.

17:07.441 --> 17:08.776
Yeah, sure, you know.

17:08.877 --> 17:10.878
As good a place as any.

17:10.944 --> 17:12.880
And you won't get too radical.

17:12.881 --> 17:13.982
Only in bed.

17:14.048 --> 17:16.885
Come here.

17:20.421 --> 17:23.590
- Sorry.
- No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

17:37.138 --> 17:40.574
You know how fast you were going?

17:40.641 --> 17:42.911
Let me guess. Too fast, right?

17:42.977 --> 17:45.513
What, are you a wise guy?

17:45.579 --> 17:48.482
Let me see your license.

17:48.549 --> 17:50.184
Jesus.

17:50.251 --> 17:51.619
You're not gonna believe this.

17:51.685 --> 17:53.754
Office, this has never
happened to me before.

17:53.821 --> 17:56.290
I left it on the table in my foyer.

17:56.357 --> 17:58.927
I've never once been
out without my license.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.463
Okay, okay, can I see your registration?

18:13.607 --> 18:15.609
It's, it's not in there.

18:15.676 --> 18:19.948
Okay, step out of the car
please and open your trunk.

18:19.981 --> 18:21.115
The trunk?

18:25.353 --> 18:27.555
The, the, the trunk of my car?

18:27.621 --> 18:29.690
Yeah, where you heading so fast, huh?

18:29.757 --> 18:32.026
I, I, I'm, I gotta catch a plane.

18:32.093 --> 18:33.670
Yeah, well, there's no
airports around here.

18:33.694 --> 18:36.764
Yeah, I was gonna take
a private to the airport.

18:36.830 --> 18:39.967
Well, you know, shouldn't
be driving without a license.

18:39.968 --> 18:41.069
I know, I know.

18:41.135 --> 18:43.771
I've never done that before.

18:43.837 --> 18:46.174
Have I seen you somewhere, huh?

18:46.240 --> 18:47.075
Me?

18:47.141 --> 18:48.076
I don't think so.

18:48.142 --> 18:49.710
You look familiar to me.

18:49.777 --> 18:52.146
Maybe you know me from
my... maybe you read my book.

18:52.213 --> 18:54.082
You know me from my book jacket.

18:54.148 --> 18:55.616
Yeah, who are you?

18:55.683 --> 18:57.218
S. J. Muntzinger.

18:58.186 --> 18:59.988
You're S. J. Muntzinger?

19:00.054 --> 19:01.055
Yeah.

19:01.122 --> 19:03.124
The S. J. Muntzinger?

19:03.191 --> 19:06.427
Yeah, you know my books?

19:06.494 --> 19:09.597
My God, you're, you're,
you're, you're, you're a genius!

19:09.663 --> 19:12.066
Well, you know I, I try.

19:12.133 --> 19:14.035
What are you doing out here?

19:14.102 --> 19:18.106
I thought you, I thought
you lived in Manhattan.

19:18.172 --> 19:21.475
No, no, I'm up here in this area.

19:21.542 --> 19:24.011
Ah, I gotta tell you I loved your book

19:24.012 --> 19:25.546
and my kids did too.

19:25.613 --> 19:27.715
They're the ones who
actually turned me onto it.

19:27.781 --> 19:28.616
It's great!

19:28.682 --> 19:29.682
Oh, well, thank you.

19:29.717 --> 19:30.851
Thank you very much.

19:30.918 --> 19:32.553
A real genius.

19:32.620 --> 19:37.091
Although I have to say, I
thought you'd be much younger.

19:37.158 --> 19:40.194
Well, I, you know, nothing
I can do about that.

19:40.261 --> 19:43.097
I, it's my haircut probably.

19:43.164 --> 19:46.900
Yeah, so this is what
you look like, huh?

19:47.035 --> 19:49.403
Yeah, for better or worse.

19:49.470 --> 19:51.039
Yeah, well, let me ask you a question.

19:51.105 --> 19:52.349
I mean, where do you come up with

19:52.373 --> 19:54.175
a character like Holden Caulfield?

19:54.242 --> 19:56.277
Where does that come from?

19:56.344 --> 19:57.845
What?

19:57.911 --> 19:59.147
And where do the ducks in

19:59.213 --> 20:01.082
Central Park go during the winter?

20:01.149 --> 20:04.885
Where do they go, to the Hamptons?

20:04.952 --> 20:07.521
I gotta tell you, man, it was
a real pleasure to meet you.

20:07.588 --> 20:09.790
You know, I haven't
read a book like yours

20:09.857 --> 20:12.793
and enjoyed it in a long
time and I'm not a big reader.

20:12.860 --> 20:14.228
You know what I mean?

20:14.295 --> 20:15.672
But it's just, the
way you used the words

20:15.696 --> 20:17.698
and then did jokes,
it was just so funny.

20:17.765 --> 20:21.102
Look at that, S. J.
Muntzinger right here huh?

20:21.169 --> 20:23.071
Yes, in person.

20:23.137 --> 20:24.338
Is that you're supposed to be

20:24.405 --> 20:27.675
some sort of a weirdo recluse, huh?

20:27.741 --> 20:31.779
Well, I, you know I
get out now and then to

20:31.845 --> 20:36.484
you know shop for groceries
and, you know, my colonoscopy.

20:36.550 --> 20:38.486
Oh, yeah? I had one of those once.

20:38.552 --> 20:39.887
You know my throat was killing me

20:39.953 --> 20:41.273
and the doctor took it right out.

20:41.322 --> 20:42.866
Hey, look, I'm not
gonna give you a ticket.

20:42.890 --> 20:45.726
Your book gave me so
much pleasure, but, uh...

20:45.793 --> 20:48.662
would you mind giving me an autograph?

20:48.729 --> 20:51.599
Oh, sure, but, yeah, come over here.

20:51.665 --> 20:53.033
- Yeah?
- Yeah, just step...

20:53.101 --> 20:54.735
As a matter of fact,

20:54.802 --> 20:57.171
if you like, what I'll do,
I'll personalize it for you.

20:57.238 --> 20:59.006
Okay yeah, yeah, Trooper Mike.

20:59.073 --> 21:01.109
Trooper Mike.

21:01.142 --> 21:02.143
My good friend.

21:02.210 --> 21:04.112
My good friend.

21:04.178 --> 21:05.189
Who's not giving me a ticket even though

21:05.213 --> 21:06.880
I was driving like a lunatic.

21:06.947 --> 21:09.117
Okay, I can't do it all, Mike.

21:09.150 --> 21:12.120
I'll just say "My good
friend trooper Mike.

21:12.186 --> 21:17.358
"God bless you", and...
"S. J. Muntzinger."

21:17.425 --> 21:19.960
Wow, what a pleasure. I
really, I appreciate it.

21:20.027 --> 21:22.029
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

21:22.130 --> 21:24.132
- Oh, thank you.
- I mean, what a thrill.

21:24.198 --> 21:26.167
Thank you, you too, God bless you, Mike.

21:29.203 --> 21:31.138
What a day.

21:31.139 --> 21:33.174
What an experience.

21:33.241 --> 21:36.910
And we were out of little frankfurters.

21:36.977 --> 21:39.180
Do you think she made it?

21:39.247 --> 21:40.257
Oh, I think we would have heard

21:40.281 --> 21:42.416
if anything happened.

21:42.483 --> 21:45.586
Hopefully she's in Cuba now.

21:45.653 --> 21:48.256
Well, you're not gonna
say you, you miss her?

21:48.322 --> 21:50.224
I, I never liked her.

21:50.291 --> 21:52.159
You know,"beware of fanatics

21:52.160 --> 21:56.163
"no matter how just their cause seems."

21:56.164 --> 21:58.166
Oh, who said that?

21:58.199 --> 22:01.435
That was Chairman Sidney Muntzinger.

22:03.604 --> 22:05.173
Back to real life.

22:05.239 --> 22:07.608
You can go to work on your sitcom now.

22:09.177 --> 22:10.478
Let me ask you a question.

22:10.544 --> 22:13.847
Do you think that it's in me to write

22:13.914 --> 22:16.617
a novel as good as "The
Catcher in the Rye"?

22:18.186 --> 22:19.620
Why do you ask that?

22:19.687 --> 22:21.489
I was just thinking maybe I should dump

22:21.555 --> 22:24.425
this whole idiotic
television series thing

22:24.492 --> 22:28.962
and, you know, give one last
shot to writing the book.

22:29.029 --> 22:30.298
I, I, I...

22:30.364 --> 22:33.234
Hey, I'm not getting any younger.

22:33.301 --> 22:35.202
Well, why not?

22:35.203 --> 22:37.505
You're amusing, and I always said

22:37.571 --> 22:40.007
you could be another Salinger.
