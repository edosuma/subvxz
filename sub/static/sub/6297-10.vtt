00:09.869 --> 00:12.067

He will.

Duke of Bisceglie
and Prince of Salerno.

06:53.533 --> 06:55.201
What are you doing here?

06:55.269 --> 06:57.737
I am suitor to
the Lady Lucrezia,

06:57.805 --> 06:59.272
daughter of his Holiness,

06:59.307 --> 07:01.040
Alexander the Sixth,
Pope of Rome.

07:01.108 --> 07:02.909
Indeed?

07:02.944 --> 07:04.844
Lucrezia Borgia?

07:06.847 --> 07:08.281
Poor boy.

07:09.583 --> 07:12.285
Come.
I will take you to her.

07:20.328 --> 07:22.495
So you are suitor to
the Lady Lucrezia.

07:22.563 --> 07:24.197
I am.

07:25.399 --> 07:28.034
A great responsibility
for one so young.

07:28.135 --> 07:29.869

will you remove in return?

07:34.409 --> 07:36.144
We will see.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.482
The Lady Lucrezia has
a great many suitors.

07:40.549 --> 07:43.685
Some are wheat and
some are chaff.

07:43.753 --> 07:47.557
And it falls to me to separate
the one from the other.

07:47.591 --> 07:50.560
I am neither wheat nor chaff.

07:51.762 --> 07:56.099
I am Alfonso d'Aragona,
and I am flesh and blood.

07:58.002 --> 07:59.403
Turn around.

08:00.739 --> 08:03.507
If it pleases you.

08:06.511 --> 08:08.311
It pleases me.

08:08.412 --> 08:10.747
Now you must do
the same in return.

08:13.751 --> 08:15.784
If it pleases you.

08:21.858 --> 08:23.225
It pleases me.

08:24.326 --> 08:26.661
So, what now?

08:26.695 --> 08:30.231
How far does your Lady Lucrezia
care for this game to go on?

08:31.800 --> 08:34.234
There is no limit.

08:34.336 --> 08:38.606
Just as one would have one's
groom break in a new horse...

08:38.707 --> 08:41.942

09:34.162 --> 09:37.531
you will know.

09:37.632 --> 09:40.067
God will tell you.

09:41.803 --> 09:43.437
[groaning]

09:43.505 --> 09:47.342
I know what you are.
Yes?

09:47.376 --> 09:51.346
I have had your kind
stoned to death...

09:51.380 --> 09:56.551
and their corpses dragged
through the streets.

10:01.056 --> 10:03.824
My kind?

10:03.858 --> 10:07.093
Men who lay with men.

10:07.161 --> 10:12.265
Sodomites who corrupt
young innocent boys

10:12.299 --> 10:17.003
who artists use as angels.

10:17.071 --> 10:21.808
I have cleansed
Florence of her sin.

10:28.584 --> 10:31.086
And yet here I am.

10:33.723 --> 10:34.923
[grunt]

10:36.392 --> 10:39.895
Your last chance.

10:39.929 --> 10:42.097
Will you confess?

10:43.099 --> 10:45.199
To you?

10:45.300 --> 10:46.834
To you?

10:46.902 --> 10:48.736
Never.

10:51.272 --> 10:53.273
To your master.

10:53.308 --> 10:55.475
Yes.

10:55.510 --> 10:57.277
None else.

11:03.385 --> 11:07.356
Duke of Bisceglie
and Prince of Salerno.

11:07.390 --> 11:08.925
Yes.

11:09.026 --> 11:11.662
What are they like,
Bisceglie and Salerno?

11:11.763 --> 11:13.564
Beautiful.

11:13.665 --> 11:16.000
But for all the world
I would rather be here.

11:16.034 --> 11:17.768
You find Rome so appealing?

11:17.802 --> 11:20.037
Not Rome.

11:20.104 --> 11:23.107
Here.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.482
When you speak of me
to the Lady Lucrezia...

11:31.583 --> 11:33.217
Mm?

11:33.318 --> 11:37.320
If... your account
is favourable...

11:37.388 --> 11:40.658
can you and I...?

11:40.725 --> 11:42.025
Never.

11:42.093 --> 11:44.328
We must never see
each other again.

11:44.395 --> 11:50.234
If you are hers,
you are hers alone.

11:50.268 --> 11:51.769
So...

11:51.836 --> 11:56.039
tell her I was inept, or
coarse or beyond ugly.

11:56.107 --> 12:00.943
And come with me
and be mine alone.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.946
You would turn down the
pope's own daughter for me?

12:04.014 --> 12:06.515
Why?

12:06.583 --> 12:09.684
Because I have never
known a woman so lovely.

12:15.391 --> 12:17.592
Poor boy.

12:24.468 --> 12:26.336
It's time for me to go.

could stand so much pain?

the man near to death.

12:48.493 --> 12:53.230

misguided is still a strength.

12:54.699 --> 12:57.234

walk through fire.

12:57.302 --> 13:00.605
I disabused him
of that notion.

13:00.706 --> 13:03.708
You have broken
his hold on power.

13:03.809 --> 13:06.711
You have broken
the bones of his body.

13:06.779 --> 13:11.050
All that you lack
is his confession.

13:11.084 --> 13:12.985
Exactly so.

13:13.053 --> 13:16.422
That which was said publicly
must be recanted publicly.

13:16.489 --> 13:18.790

<i>he would be poison.</i>

13:20.493 --> 13:23.128

16:42.560 --> 16:43.961
Oh.

16:48.766 --> 16:51.334
Yes, I will marry him.
[gasps]

16:51.368 --> 16:54.237
He has all the sweetness
of an apple on the tree.

16:56.506 --> 16:58.674
I will marry him
tomorrow if you wish it.

16:58.709 --> 17:00.777
Oh!
[gasps]

17:00.845 --> 17:02.679
You may kiss me.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.151

17:28.039 --> 17:29.673
How refreshing that our children

17:29.708 --> 17:32.410
are still able to surprise us.

17:32.444 --> 17:33.978
Eminence.

17:34.980 --> 17:38.449
[quietly] We have a body,
your Eminence.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.451
What?

17:40.519 --> 17:43.087
Well, tell us.

17:48.426 --> 17:50.894
There is a body.

18:14.550 --> 18:16.918
OUT!

18:29.099 --> 18:32.468
Who- Who...
is this?

18:32.536 --> 18:35.471
No one, your Holiness.
It's a mistake.

18:37.808 --> 18:41.277
[sighs]

18:41.345 --> 18:43.614
You've been searching
the mortuaries.

18:46.618 --> 18:49.020
Did our son order this?

18:49.088 --> 18:50.922
No, I did.

18:53.793 --> 18:56.060
You consider him dead?

18:56.094 --> 18:58.462
I consider the possibility.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.254
Do you truly
want to do this?

19:25.756 --> 19:28.192
Truly, no.

19:32.198 --> 19:34.666
But we must.

19:39.104 --> 19:41.839
How long must
this continue?

19:43.909 --> 19:47.110
We both know you
cannot stand much more.

19:47.211 --> 19:48.645
[quietly]
I...

19:48.679 --> 19:52.916
have run dry of screams.

19:52.950 --> 19:54.951
Then end it.

19:55.018 --> 19:57.120
Admit your heresy.
[bangs table]

19:57.221 --> 20:01.558
My strength fails me.

20:01.592 --> 20:05.295
My will fails me.

20:05.396 --> 20:06.997
I saved you
for this very purpose.

20:07.032 --> 20:08.933
Now you sign it,
and end it.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.002
I am weak...

20:11.036 --> 20:12.370
and...

20:12.404 --> 20:15.940
and no will...

20:16.008 --> 20:17.041
[gasps]

20:20.145 --> 20:21.945
No.

20:22.046 --> 20:25.115
No!

20:26.417 --> 20:28.552
You went too far!

20:28.586 --> 20:31.588
[weakly gasping]

20:33.057 --> 20:34.924
He's alive.

20:34.958 --> 20:36.459
Just.
[weakly gasping]

20:36.493 --> 20:38.595
God speaks to me!

20:38.696 --> 20:41.198
Whatever you do to me...

20:41.232 --> 20:43.466
God is ready.

20:43.501 --> 20:46.970
I thank God
for your confession.

He cannot speak of this.

20:53.679 --> 20:57.783
You...
bastard!

20:57.851 --> 20:59.518
Guards!

20:59.585 --> 21:02.321
You will burn for
your blasphemy!

21:02.388 --> 21:04.856
No, it is you who will burn.

21:04.957 --> 21:14.234
And with my last strength
I damn this unholy pope.

21:14.302 --> 21:23.243
I shout to the world the
falseness of this confession!

21:24.979 --> 21:26.613
Hold him.

21:26.681 --> 21:28.348
I'll have your tongue.

21:28.415 --> 21:29.582
[screaming]

21:29.617 --> 21:31.051
Hold him!

21:40.961 --> 21:43.429
These poor creatures were
all brought in last night?

21:43.497 --> 21:44.696
Yes, lady.

21:44.798 --> 21:47.132
The carts come in
all night long.

21:47.166 --> 21:49.701

here, sir, if you'd like to see.

Holy Father, I bring you
the signed confession

23:19.893 --> 23:22.628
of the heretic
Savonarola of Florence.

23:31.736 --> 23:34.571
What happened?

23:37.009 --> 23:40.211
He was...

23:40.279 --> 23:42.747
dragged from the Tiber.

23:44.283 --> 23:47.919
Dogs...
cats...

23:48.021 --> 23:54.026
the stillborn offspring
of prostitutes...

23:54.127 --> 23:56.195
and our son.

23:59.499 --> 24:02.268
Leave us, Cardinals.

24:13.681 --> 24:16.316
Who would do such a thing?

24:16.384 --> 24:18.552
Who would dare?

24:18.586 --> 24:21.188
<i>Who had cause</i>
<i>to wish him harm?</i>

24:21.222 --> 24:23.189
Any one of the many
he harmed.

24:23.223 --> 24:25.225
What?

24:28.395 --> 24:30.930
What do you say?
Nothing, Father.

24:30.965 --> 24:33.199
What do you say?

24:35.870 --> 24:40.239
You asked who would
do such a thing.

24:40.306 --> 24:43.142
The answer is,
many people, Father.

24:43.210 --> 24:45.411
Many people.

24:47.881 --> 24:50.482
We don't understand.

24:53.585 --> 24:56.020
Here lies your brother,

24:56.054 --> 24:59.791
murdered in cold blood,

24:59.858 --> 25:02.493
and you speak as if...

25:05.230 --> 25:07.498
Many people.

25:07.599 --> 25:10.701
Many people, you say?

25:10.769 --> 25:12.402
Do you count yourself
among their number?

25:12.470 --> 25:13.604
Why-
Father.

25:13.671 --> 25:14.938
Let her speak!

25:14.973 --> 25:16.506
What would you have me say?

25:16.607 --> 25:20.242
You know what he did to me!
What he took from me!

25:20.310 --> 25:21.977
You all do!

25:22.045 --> 25:26.948
And you stood by
for the honour of the family.

25:27.049 --> 25:32.320
I have wished him
dead a thousand times,

25:32.387 --> 25:37.591
and now you want me
to mourn him?

25:37.693 --> 25:40.028
I'm sorry, Father,
I cannot.

25:45.702 --> 25:48.070
And you?

25:48.138 --> 25:49.772
He was your brother.

25:49.806 --> 25:51.875
You show no tears?

25:51.942 --> 25:54.811
Are you stone?

25:54.879 --> 25:58.448
I wept them all out
for him long ago.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.150
Over and over,

26:00.251 --> 26:03.587
I watched him fail,
and I wept.

26:03.621 --> 26:06.722
You should know:
you were there.

26:06.790 --> 26:10.325
And still you granted him
your every favour.

26:28.779 --> 26:32.715
Take yourselves-
both-

26:32.783 --> 26:37.453
away from our sight!

27:07.985 --> 27:10.253
[clearing throat]

27:18.261 --> 27:21.163
Clean him up.

27:21.198 --> 27:22.832
Bring him back to life

27:22.899 --> 27:26.535
as if he were our own
Lord Jesus Christ.

27:26.570 --> 27:29.004
Yes, Eminence.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.473
Do your work.

27:31.808 --> 27:34.477
[fire crackling]

27:34.511 --> 27:37.646
How could we have
missed such enmity

27:37.714 --> 27:42.018
in the bosom
of our family?

27:46.924 --> 27:50.393
You saw with
a father's eyes.

27:57.335 --> 28:00.570
And you?

28:00.638 --> 28:03.106
Would you have
had him dead?

28:05.643 --> 28:07.377
No.

28:07.444 --> 28:11.014
No, he was our son.

28:11.116 --> 28:14.284
Ah.
But there were times...

28:14.352 --> 28:16.753
many times...

28:16.854 --> 28:19.222
when I wished that
he had not been born.

28:19.290 --> 28:21.358
Oh.

28:25.196 --> 28:28.398
Let him go.

28:28.466 --> 28:31.135
Arrange the funeral
and say our farewells.

28:31.169 --> 28:32.736
No.
He is our son.

28:32.770 --> 28:35.105
He will not be buried.
I will not let him go.

28:35.173 --> 28:37.474
We have to bury him.
No burial.

28:37.542 --> 28:40.111

Yes, yes, I know.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.460
You would have me
marry you to him.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.097
Yes.

36:14.006 --> 36:17.009
Do you love him?

36:17.077 --> 36:20.746
I think he is good.

36:20.814 --> 36:23.015
I believe I can love him.

36:24.484 --> 36:29.289
So you have
a good man at last.

36:29.323 --> 36:31.758
But I cannot marry you.

36:34.362 --> 36:37.031
I truly wish it.

36:37.098 --> 36:41.669
These hands have seen
too much of blood and sin

36:41.737 --> 36:44.572
to join two such
tender creatures.

36:46.475 --> 36:49.744
These hands bear
a cardinal's ring.

we take all mortification.

38:19.103 --> 38:22.438
And still we are punished.

38:22.473 --> 38:23.907
This is not God's doing, Father.

Everything is God's doing!

Until we find his murderer,
though we scour all Italy,

38:34.718 --> 38:36.885
Juan shall not be buried.

38:36.953 --> 38:38.988
There must be a funeral.
It is arranged.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.523
No!

38:40.591 --> 38:44.260
We will not send him
to purgatory.

38:44.361 --> 38:47.897

no hiding place so deep

38:52.337 --> 38:54.438

39:29.810 --> 39:32.079
...must.

39:42.457 --> 39:45.659
Then first I ask that
you hear my confession.

39:45.727 --> 39:48.195
Your confession?

39:48.296 --> 39:49.897
And I further ask
that you release me

39:49.965 --> 39:54.168
from my vows as cardinal,
and...

39:54.202 --> 39:56.637
I ask for your
forgiveness of my sins.

39:59.107 --> 40:02.476
What sins have you committed?

40:02.543 --> 40:04.845
I have protected the papacy
against her enemies

40:04.912 --> 40:08.348
when none other would
stand his ground.

40:08.382 --> 40:10.217
I have made my family strong

40:10.285 --> 40:12.920
in the face of those
who would weaken it.

40:13.021 --> 40:16.022
I have brought low
the heretic Savonarola

40:16.057 --> 40:18.025
and outwitted the army
of the French King,

40:18.093 --> 40:20.461
and all this, Father,
all this,

40:20.495 --> 40:24.297
I have done for Rome
and the Church...

40:24.365 --> 40:25.999
and for you.

40:34.475 --> 40:37.210
Tell me your sins.

40:50.325 --> 40:57.030
It is this,
and only this:

40:57.098 --> 41:00.500
that I have taken
upon my head

41:00.602 --> 41:04.505
the act that none other
would dare commit,

41:04.572 --> 41:09.644
though its commission
benefits all.

41:09.679 --> 41:13.949
I swore a vow long ago

41:14.017 --> 41:15.416
that I would put
an end to anyone

41:15.517 --> 41:17.585
who brought dishonour
on our family,

41:17.686 --> 41:20.388
dishonour on Rome,
dishonour on you.

41:20.423 --> 41:25.193
Oh... oh... oh.

41:32.301 --> 41:34.603
So you see, Father,

41:34.704 --> 41:38.340
the robes of a cardinal no
longer sit easy on my shoulders.

41:38.408 --> 41:40.409
A cardinal's ring
makes it harder

41:40.510 --> 41:42.245
to grip the hilt
of a sword.

41:42.346 --> 41:44.147
I beg you will
release me of my vows,

41:44.215 --> 41:46.149
and you will grant
me your forgiveness.

41:55.328 --> 41:57.429
Father?

42:02.702 --> 42:05.771
I release you from your vows.

42:34.533 --> 42:36.134
[sobbing]

43:07.965 --> 43:11.333
I have met with the committee
of ceremonies.

43:13.736 --> 43:16.704
The funeral is
being arranged.

43:16.738 --> 43:18.539
Your father won't
hear of it, Cesare.

43:18.573 --> 43:19.974
<i>He won't even consider it.</i>

43:20.008 --> 43:22.377
He doesn't need to consider it.

43:22.444 --> 43:24.512
There will be a Requiem Mass.

43:24.546 --> 43:26.080
The city bells will be muffled,

43:26.148 --> 43:28.716
there will be 16 black
horses drawing a carriage

43:28.784 --> 43:31.285
dressed in black silk
to bear the coffin.

43:31.353 --> 43:33.722
That is the funeral.

43:33.823 --> 43:38.360
But first, your betrothal.

43:38.461 --> 43:40.462
We are cancelling
the celebration.

43:40.530 --> 43:42.365
Surely it cannot
go ahead?

43:42.432 --> 43:44.066
Surely it must go ahead.

43:44.101 --> 43:46.737
It is for me to decide,
and the decision was made.

43:46.805 --> 43:49.106
Cesare, listen to me.

43:49.174 --> 43:50.575
It is not possible.

43:50.642 --> 43:53.544
No. It must stand.

43:53.579 --> 43:56.481
Life does not hold its
breath for one man's grief.

43:56.515 --> 43:58.916
Yes, and wounds
take time to heal!

43:59.017 --> 44:02.019
Not a word more! Please!
It is decided!

So, tell me, Cesare,

51:31.337 --> 51:33.504
what exactly are
we celebrating?

51:33.539 --> 51:36.008
Your sister's betrothal
or the death of your brother?

51:37.443 --> 51:39.911
My love for my sister outweighs
my grief for my brother.

51:39.979 --> 51:41.179
Grief?

51:41.247 --> 51:44.449
Then why do you force
this false joy upon us?

51:44.516 --> 51:47.451
We are dancing on
your brother's grave.

51:47.486 --> 51:50.454
Mother. Mother.
He's here.

51:57.261 --> 51:59.996
[music stops]

52:20.254 --> 52:23.289
We would speak with you.

52:39.909 --> 52:41.943
Father.

52:44.580 --> 52:47.482
Bring us some wine.

53:28.055 --> 53:30.390
It is good, Holiness.

53:49.312 --> 53:51.880
What's happened to
your hands, Father?

53:57.153 --> 53:59.654
We have buried our son.

54:03.492 --> 54:06.961
And we realize now...

54:07.029 --> 54:11.066
that we have brought
this upon ourselves.

54:14.604 --> 54:18.874
Father?

54:18.941 --> 54:21.877
You are our own doing.

54:21.978 --> 54:25.980
What you've done
is our doing also.

54:26.048 --> 54:28.316
We brought you to this.

54:33.622 --> 54:38.392
You say we granted
every favour to him.

54:40.962 --> 54:45.766
But our favours fell on him so
easily, of their own accord.

54:49.971 --> 54:52.338
You are too much like me.

54:55.442 --> 54:58.712
A man feels less...

54:58.779 --> 55:02.348
favour for his own
image reflected.

55:10.491 --> 55:15.128
If I cannot have
your affection,

55:15.162 --> 55:18.764
can you at least grant me
your forgiveness?
