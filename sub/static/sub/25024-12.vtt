00:50.592 --> 00:54.095
[male radio announcer]  Good afternoon,
Arcadia Oaks. Lots going on today.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.889
-Whoa, whoa!
-[car horns honking]

00:55.972 --> 00:57.432
Gene, you feel that?  [grunts]

00:57.515 --> 00:59.684
Uh, seems like tonight's
Battle of the Bands

00:59.768 --> 01:02.145
won't be the only thing
rocking and rolling in town.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.563
[school bell ringing]

01:03.646 --> 01:06.191
School is out,
so there's no excuse for missing it,

01:06.274 --> 01:09.360
because everyone should be
in the Town Square this afternoon

01:09.444 --> 01:12.030
for what should be an epic showdown.

01:12.113 --> 01:14.616
The finale doesn't get
any bigger than this.

01:14.699 --> 01:15.909
-[strums]
-[drum beating]

01:16.451 --> 01:19.496
In fact, I'm willing to bet
this town's never gonna be the same

01:19.579 --> 01:23.041
after tonight's Battle of the Bands.

01:23.124 --> 01:27.670
I've taken the liberty of constructing
a rudimentary model of Arcadia.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.424
If we focus our defensive efforts here,
then when the Gumm-Gumms attack--

01:31.508 --> 01:33.510
[sighs, mumbles]

01:33.593 --> 01:36.513
-Do you have something to say?
-This is a waste of time.

01:36.971 --> 01:40.266
You broke the museum. You Philistine!

01:40.350 --> 01:44.062
Our focus is not Arcadia,
it is Trollmarket.

01:44.145 --> 01:47.690
If we destroy Morgana,
we stop the Eternal Night.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.111
The Trollhunter and I
must venture into Trollmarket.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.780
-[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Gas station.
-While Gunmar and Angor Rot

01:53.863 --> 01:56.783
turn Arcadia
into an all-you-can-eat buffet?

01:56.866 --> 02:00.328
For having six eyes,
you are very short-sighted.

02:00.411 --> 02:04.207
Defeating Gunmar is pointless
if Morgana is still--

02:04.290 --> 02:08.961
And defeating Morgana is pointless
if everyone in Arcadia is dead!

02:09.044 --> 02:09.878
[ground rumbling]

02:09.963 --> 02:12.590
-I don't know my own strength.
-[Aaarrrgghh!!! grunts]

02:12.674 --> 02:14.759
That was the third tremor today.

02:14.843 --> 02:18.638
At this rate, I fear the Eternal Night
will be upon us within the hour.

02:18.721 --> 02:21.474
The Battle of the Bands is on.
The square will be packed.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.893
-Everyone in Arcadia is there.
-[chomps, gulps]

02:23.977 --> 02:26.271
-Well, anyone who's cool, at least.
-[burps]

02:26.354 --> 02:28.565
On the bright side,
with everyone clustered,

02:28.648 --> 02:31.067
we now know where the Gumm-Gumms
will strike first.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.362
-How is that the bright side?
-Trollmarket will be deserted.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.573
Morgana will be unprotected.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.950
Gunmar and Angor Rot are my fight.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.664
First, we'll do what we can
to clear Arcadia Square.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.291
So no one gets hurt.

02:46.499 --> 02:51.629
Actually, uh, Master Jim,
there is no "we" until the night falls.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.047
In your current form,

02:53.131 --> 02:55.925
sunlight will burn you
as much as any of us trolls.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.261
Maybe Merlin can whip up
some SPF one million?

02:58.344 --> 02:59.971
-Uh...
-We'll go with the children,

03:00.054 --> 03:02.432
and put a stop
to this Battle of the Bands.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.893
Then am I to fight Morgana alone?

03:04.976 --> 03:07.061
I'll go. Keep safe.

03:07.145 --> 03:10.732
Thank you, oh, very, very, big one.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.734
The moment of truth is upon us all.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.819
With fortitude and bravery,

03:14.903 --> 03:20.533
we can end the threat posed by Morgana,
Gunmar and Angor Rot for all time!

03:20.617 --> 03:27.290
Oh, yeah!

03:29.542 --> 03:31.502
It felt like we were all gonna do that.

03:34.088 --> 03:37.300
Merlin, won't all these earthquakes
damage the Darklands?

03:37.383 --> 03:39.135
It'll crumble to bits, I fear.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.804
Are you concerned
for the Changeling Familiars?

03:41.888 --> 03:43.640
I promised to return for them.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.558
We need to save them.

03:45.642 --> 03:50.647
I was afraid your heart would stop you
from seeing the bigger picture today.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.566
-But I might have a solution.
-[microwave pings]

03:54.567 --> 03:55.944
[coughs]

03:56.486 --> 03:57.320
[Merlin] You.

03:57.612 --> 04:02.408
You'll be able to safely transport
the babies using this Cradlestone.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.409
[grunts]

04:03.493 --> 04:07.747
-Can you handle this on your own?
-I know a guy who can lend a tiny hand.

04:08.206 --> 04:12.043
-[humming]
-Hey, Chompsky, we gotta go.

04:12.126 --> 04:14.587

04:20.093 --> 04:20.927
Er...?

04:22.345 --> 04:23.179

04:28.184 --> 04:29.644
[Chompsky yelps]

04:31.604 --> 04:33.982
Please, sweetie, be safe.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.277
I will. Don't worry.

04:40.488 --> 04:44.617
If ever there was a time to worry,
this is it.

04:47.495 --> 04:48.913
Okay. I'll be at the hospital.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.041
I've got a bad feeling
it's gonna be a busy night.

[groans]

05:02.093 --> 05:04.095
Jim, we're going to be okay.

05:05.555 --> 05:10.560
Tonight, we will feel human skulls
break beneath our feet.

05:10.977 --> 05:15.189
Tonight, we claim the Earth for trollkind!

05:15.273 --> 05:16.441
[all cheering]

05:18.651 --> 05:22.697
Because tonight will never end!

05:23.031 --> 05:27.285
[guards chanting]
Gunmar! Gunmar! Gunmar! Gunmar!

05:27.368 --> 05:30.121
Are you not thrilled
for your kind's victory?

05:30.204 --> 05:31.956
Or have you lost your faith?

05:32.040 --> 05:36.586
Never. The Trollhunter killed me once
and took my eye.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.422
Tonight, I take his life.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.300
Good. You are my champion.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.970
You will stand by my side
when the world becomes mine.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.972
And what of Gunmar?

05:48.056 --> 05:51.517
Gunmar is a pawn,
a brute to get what I want.

05:51.809 --> 05:55.355
In time, he will be disposed of.

06:10.119 --> 06:12.080
Wow, cool.

What is she doing? What song is this?

08:30.510 --> 08:33.261
Listen to me.
Something dangerous is coming.

Try to keep up.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.346
Wow.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.223
You all right, lovelies?

14:52.016 --> 14:53.475
[yells]

14:59.315 --> 15:03.652
Ah, Master Jim,
we fight well together, don't we?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.864
I've got this area covered.
The rest of the city is overrun.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.700
Fan out and take down any threat,
Trollhunters.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.412
Carry on without me, Master Jim.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.625
If anyone else is in trouble out there,
get them inside the school.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.376
[cell phone ringing]

15:19.460 --> 15:24.256
-Hey, what's up, Nana? Kinda busy.
-Oh, Toby pie, it's an emergency.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.551
-Your friend ate the entire pie.
-[burps]

15:27.635 --> 15:31.680
He may be blind,
but his digestion seems to work just fine.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.642
Keep the cats inside.
Promise me you won't go out.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.689
Now what?

15:40.773 --> 15:45.194
She's supposed to be here.
She needs the power of the Heartstone.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.154
[grunts]

15:50.324 --> 15:52.785
[Aaarrrgghh!!! grunts, roars]

15:52.868 --> 15:56.080
Your friends won't be able
to resurrect you this time.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.457
Same for you.

16:02.711 --> 16:05.255
-[laughing]
-[grunts]

16:06.256 --> 16:07.883
Leave them alone, Morgana.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.593
Surprise.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.428
Oh, have you missed me?

16:19.395 --> 16:21.438
-[grunts]
-[laughs]

16:22.898 --> 16:25.859
-You old fool. [laughs]
-[gasps]

16:28.362 --> 16:32.366
[grunts]
My magic. You've-- you've taken it?

16:32.449 --> 16:35.369
All those centuries you locked me away,

16:35.452 --> 16:37.162
what did you think I was doing?

16:37.579 --> 16:40.958
Let me show you how strong I am now.

16:41.834 --> 16:42.835
[Merlin grunts]

16:43.335 --> 16:47.631
-I am stronger than you.
-You won't win. The Trollhunter--

16:47.715 --> 16:51.218
-I've already won!
-[grunting]

16:52.970 --> 16:54.596
Go finish the Trollhunter.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.057
I'll handle this mess.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.142
[Merlin groans]

16:59.018 --> 16:59.935
[Angor Rot grunts]

17:00.019 --> 17:04.147
¡Es el apocalipsis!  I swear, I saw demons.

17:04.606 --> 17:05.691
But with perfect teeth.

17:05.773 --> 17:07.693
Trust me, you're not crazy.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.278
You're lucky to be alive.

17:09.361 --> 17:13.073
- ¡Loco, loco, loco!
-Oh. [chuckles]

17:13.656 --> 17:17.118
-So, what brings you here?
-[shuddering]

17:17.202 --> 17:20.622
Zip-Slippers, don't fail me now. [yells]

17:22.499 --> 17:23.625
[grunts]

17:24.917 --> 17:27.378
[both cheer] Creepslayers!

17:27.463 --> 17:28.464
Yeah!

17:29.757 --> 17:31.175
[screaming]

17:38.474 --> 17:40.350
[both] Whoa.

17:40.434 --> 17:45.314
-I've never felt this way before.
-She's so tall. [chuckles]

17:45.689 --> 17:46.690
[groans]

17:47.066 --> 17:48.984
[rumbles]

17:49.068 --> 17:51.612
School is the last place I wanna be.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.573
Stalklings!

17:56.283 --> 17:58.660
[screams] Toby!

17:58.744 --> 18:00.829
Darci!

18:02.081 --> 18:03.624
[Darci squeals]

18:05.375 --> 18:06.710
Toby!

18:09.755 --> 18:11.048
[growling, screeching]

18:11.131 --> 18:15.469
Let go of my girlfriend!

18:16.637 --> 18:18.138
-TP!
-[gasps]

18:19.556 --> 18:20.557
[grunting]

18:23.727 --> 18:24.561
[screams]

18:27.106 --> 18:28.649
[Toby screams]

18:33.320 --> 18:35.114
I think we can start dating again.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.825
-[chuckles]
-Officially.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.578
[sighs] I don't wanna die just yet.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.666
-[chuckles]
-[rumbling]

18:45.749 --> 18:47.000
[Toby, Claire] Whoa!

18:49.545 --> 18:51.547
[screeching]

18:53.298 --> 18:55.801
Uh, I thought those were only
in the Darklands.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.220
-Well, they're in Arcadia now.
-[Wumpas yelling]

19:07.271 --> 19:10.274
-Toby King.
-Your spear, my Queen.

19:10.357 --> 19:13.610
Hey! Queen now? All right.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.948
Boom, boom, shake the room! My cousin!

19:18.782 --> 19:21.034
Say what?

19:22.703 --> 19:25.914
[roaring, whimpering]

19:27.332 --> 19:28.917
We gotta get off the streets.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.173
Hurry, get inside. [gasps]

19:36.008 --> 19:37.301
[car honking, screeches]

19:37.384 --> 19:40.387
Sorry, pal, but nobody gets in
without a hall pass.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.682
Susannah and I will not allow it.
¿Entiende?

19:43.765 --> 19:46.810
We few! We happy few!

19:46.894 --> 19:49.354
-We band of brothers!
-[car revs]

19:51.481 --> 19:52.316
[sighs]

19:52.399 --> 19:55.110
[Ms. Janeth]
I've always wanted to play Henry V!

19:57.196 --> 19:58.238
[Merlin grunting]

20:04.161 --> 20:06.246
[groans, gasps]

20:06.788 --> 20:09.416
Goodbye, old friend.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.629
[buzzing]

20:16.215 --> 20:17.216
[groans]

20:22.221 --> 20:23.847
[panting]

20:29.770 --> 20:31.271
-[grunts]
-[spears banging]

20:39.029 --> 20:41.365
[spears banging]

20:50.290 --> 20:51.124
No.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.210
No!

20:53.585 --> 20:54.836
[grunts, gasps]

21:01.551 --> 21:02.511
[banging stops]

21:07.182 --> 21:09.017
[Gunmar] I told you

21:09.101 --> 21:11.520
I would kill you myself.

21:14.815 --> 21:19.236
You let the old wizard
work his magic on you, I see.

21:19.319 --> 21:21.405
Scared it's gonna be a fair fight?

21:21.488 --> 21:23.407
[laughs]

21:24.283 --> 21:27.035
It's not going to be as fair as you think.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.207
[laughs]

21:32.833 --> 21:33.667
[growls]

21:33.750 --> 21:38.130
You aren't strong enough
to take on the both of us, Hunter.

21:38.213 --> 21:39.965
You left Morgana unprotected.

21:40.048 --> 21:43.760
Merlin is down in Trollmarket right now.
Once he stops her--

21:43.844 --> 21:47.264
Merlin might have had centuries
to devise his plan,

21:47.347 --> 21:48.640
but you forget.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.809
He was sleeping.

21:50.892 --> 21:53.603
Morgana was awake.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.397
-[Angor Rot laughs]
-[Gunmar cackles]

21:55.480 --> 21:56.315
[gasps]

21:56.690 --> 21:59.484
Now, who goes first?

21:59.568 --> 22:01.236
Why take turns?

22:03.322 --> 22:04.614
[yells]

22:08.535 --> 22:10.537
-[yelling]
-[grunting]

22:13.206 --> 22:14.249
No!
