[music playing]

00:55.289 --> 00:57.591
Hey, Jackie.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.893
Nice crease.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.028
- Hi, Mom.
- Where you going?

01:01.061 --> 01:01.929
Out.

01:01.962 --> 01:04.132
Can I go with you?

01:04.165 --> 01:04.965
Oh please.

01:08.001 --> 01:12.406
Dan, we could, um, go to
Phil and Vonda's later on.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.276
I don't know.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.678
What's the party for, anyway?

01:17.711 --> 01:19.046
Well, what difference
does it make?

01:19.079 --> 01:21.115
It's people.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.683
It's a chance to get
out of the house.

01:22.716 --> 01:23.584
Come on!

01:23.617 --> 01:24.652
Play defense!

01:24.685 --> 01:25.986
Is that what you're
going to do all day?

01:26.019 --> 01:27.488
Just sit here, and watch sports?

01:27.521 --> 01:30.424
Pretty much.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.260
Well, Phil and Vonda
don't live that far.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.295
I mean, I promise you won't
have to be on your feet

01:34.328 --> 01:35.596
more than two minutes.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.699
Phil and Vonda
have a TV set, too.

01:38.732 --> 01:43.871
Yeah, they got an iron, too.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.173
Why don't you go over there.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.574
I'm going to work.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.475
I'll see you later.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.376
You gonna be here?

01:48.409 --> 01:50.544
For the rest of my life.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.881
[music playing]

01:56.884 --> 01:58.286
I'm back.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.254
How much are they losing by?

02:00.288 --> 02:01.222
14.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.723
It's the worst
team I've ever saw.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.193
These guys are so bad,
it's unbelievable.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.260
You want me to mend these?

02:06.294 --> 02:07.661
Or just toss them out?

02:07.695 --> 02:08.796
Yeah, honey,
would you fix them?

02:08.829 --> 02:10.564
I want to keep them.

02:10.598 --> 02:14.802
Do you want me to, uh, fix
this so you can wear it too?

02:14.835 --> 02:18.038
Yeah, honey, it's my favorite.

02:18.071 --> 02:20.441
[motorcycle revs]

02:20.474 --> 02:23.043
Dad, there's a guy outside
petting a motorcycle.

02:29.983 --> 02:30.784
Oh, let me.

02:35.323 --> 02:38.259
Oh my god, you're not
gonna believe this.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.092
Get over here.

02:42.730 --> 02:43.597
Hey!

02:43.631 --> 02:44.632
Hey!

02:44.665 --> 02:45.533
ZIGGY: Hey what?

02:45.566 --> 02:47.034
No bikers allowed, man!

02:47.067 --> 02:47.868
Ziggy!

02:53.307 --> 02:56.610
[screams]

02:57.678 --> 02:58.712
Oh, man!

02:58.746 --> 02:59.613
Yeah!

02:59.647 --> 03:03.584
Oh, whoa, you guys got big.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.857
Not really, it's just
a very small house.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.360
What brings you
back here, man?

03:12.393 --> 03:14.362
Come back to find yourself?

03:14.395 --> 03:16.630
Hey, man, I never lost it.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.599
Well, that's your opinion.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.968
So what brings you
back to Lanford?

03:21.001 --> 03:24.037
Oh, we're laying in a
fiber optic cable right

03:24.071 --> 03:26.240
through the center of town.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.909
BECKY: Mom, whose motorcycle
is in our front yard?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.478
Whoa, who are these kids?

03:30.511 --> 03:33.547
They came with house.

03:33.581 --> 03:37.117
- Wow, I had to make mine.
- You got kids?

03:37.150 --> 03:39.420
- Yeah, two boys.
- No.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.721
Yeah, checked them at birth.

03:40.754 --> 03:41.555
They're boys.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.361
How come you didn't
invite us to your wedding?

03:47.395 --> 03:48.462
What wedding?

03:48.496 --> 03:49.797
Aren't you married?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.332
Nah.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.834
No, we talk about it sometimes.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.970
But the kids are against it.

03:57.004 --> 03:57.805
I can see why.

04:03.344 --> 04:06.246
And what's your name?

04:06.280 --> 04:07.481
Darlene.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.649
Ooh, I dig it.

04:08.682 --> 04:12.520
You named her after
the mouseketeer.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.422
What!

04:14.455 --> 04:15.856
Is that true?

04:15.889 --> 04:18.158
Of course that's not true.

04:18.191 --> 04:20.294
You gotta meet our son, Cubby!

04:27.234 --> 04:30.438
Annette, right?

04:30.471 --> 04:31.539
Becky.

04:31.572 --> 04:32.706
Hi, Becky.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.908
Ziggy Walsh.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.076
Hi.

04:36.109 --> 04:36.977
DJ: [machine gun sounds]

04:37.010 --> 04:38.579
Whoa, lookout!

04:38.612 --> 04:39.847
This is DJ.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.281
Say hell to Ziggy.

04:41.315 --> 04:44.017
Hello, Ziggy.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.386
Perfect, you can go now.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.954
That's the lad.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.156
So how's it feel to
be back in Lanford?

04:49.189 --> 04:50.658
It's weird, man.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.260
I mean, I made the whole Main
Street-Landford Avenue loop,

04:53.293 --> 04:54.161
you know.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.696
Drove by the high school.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.297
Drove by Cooks.

04:57.331 --> 05:01.535
I mean-- like, absolutely
nothing's changed.

05:01.569 --> 05:04.004
I mean, even those,
uh, railroad tracks

05:04.037 --> 05:08.509
behind the supermarket that
run right into the cement wall.

05:08.542 --> 05:12.946
In my opinion, the perfect
metaphor for Lanford.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.484
Have you ever killed anyone?

05:16.517 --> 05:19.820
[music playing]

05:19.853 --> 05:21.722
Check it out, man.

05:21.755 --> 05:25.993
'71, Look Out Point,
that's when Yor introduced

05:26.026 --> 05:28.696
me to the Harris sisters.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.498
Yor?

05:30.531 --> 05:31.565
That's your dad.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.400
Yor.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.470
Yor?!?

05:36.504 --> 05:37.605
Yor!

05:37.638 --> 05:42.976
Yeah, you little chicks
got a problem with that?

05:43.010 --> 05:45.813
I called Jackie, she's
gonna meet us later,

05:45.846 --> 05:47.681
so we can go out.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.617
OK, great.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.019
I thought that we might spring
for a meal at the Lanford inn,

05:52.052 --> 05:53.454
but you gotta wear a tie.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.026
Sorry.

05:59.059 --> 06:02.463
Danny, let's you and me
just go over to the Lobo, huh?

06:02.496 --> 06:04.432
Hey, what about me?

06:04.465 --> 06:05.699
What about you?

06:05.733 --> 06:07.668
You're not leaving me
here while you two go out

06:07.701 --> 06:09.002
and guy around.

06:09.036 --> 06:09.837
Norbert.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.477
Norbert?

06:16.510 --> 06:19.246
I don't respond to that name.

06:19.279 --> 06:22.282
Does your mom
still call you Norby?

06:22.315 --> 06:24.652
Hey, man, how do you
live with this chick?

06:24.685 --> 06:25.919
I have to.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.421
I'm married to her.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.657
You guys got married?

06:29.690 --> 06:32.125
You were in the wedding.

06:32.159 --> 06:32.960
Right.

06:35.696 --> 06:39.399
OK, Rosie, you're
going with us.

06:39.433 --> 06:43.236
See, like I said,
nothing's changed.

06:43.270 --> 06:49.142
Check it out ladies,
'71, your man.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.444
Where was I?

06:50.478 --> 06:54.715
Honey, the idea of you
isn't even in this picture.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.084
You look pretty
cool here, Yor.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.786
Whose bike?

06:58.819 --> 07:00.454
Mine.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.690
Dig those funky bell bottoms.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.425
[puking sound]

07:05.459 --> 07:09.229
Amazing, man,
she's just like you.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.664
I am not.

07:10.698 --> 07:11.965
I'm nothing like her!

07:11.999 --> 07:13.300
See what I mean?

07:13.333 --> 07:17.237
Honey, you are no more like
me than I am like my mother.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.508
Oh god.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.810
Hey, Zig, can we go
look at your Honda?

07:22.843 --> 07:23.877
My what!

07:23.911 --> 07:25.779
My what!

07:25.813 --> 07:26.880
Pumpkin, it's a Harley.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.982
It is a Heritage Soft Tail.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.552
The new Evolution Engine.

07:31.585 --> 07:36.089
The blockhead that is
80, 8-0, cubic inches

07:36.123 --> 07:38.892
of bone shaking power.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.028
Annette.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.997
Beck, not a Honda, Harley.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.398
Can you say Harley?

07:45.432 --> 07:48.135
I know that you can.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.704
Apologize to the Zig-meister.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.640
Sorry.

07:52.673 --> 07:53.507
Zig-meister.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.211
It's OK.

07:58.245 --> 08:01.281
Once you get on one,
you know the difference.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.349
And guess what, honey?

08:02.382 --> 08:05.085
That will never
happen in my lifetime.

08:05.118 --> 08:05.986
Can we go sit on it?

08:06.019 --> 08:06.820
(IN UNISON) No.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.089
We'll just look.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.324
OK, but not too hard.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.794
Becky, you watch your brother
and sister while we're gone,

08:13.827 --> 08:14.695
OK?

08:14.728 --> 08:16.029
But not too hard.

08:16.063 --> 08:21.802
Hey, Danny, whatever happened
to that '55 Pan of yours?

08:21.835 --> 08:22.936
What are you
talking about, man?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.471
It's out in the garage.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.839
How's it holding up?

08:25.873 --> 08:27.074
Pretty good.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.577
Ah, man, now that
was a beautiful bike.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.479
I mean, you had it
tricked out real cherry.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.914
That bike's a classic.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.083
We better get to the Lobo
before it gets too crowded.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.651
Hey, come on, but
I just got to take

08:37.685 --> 08:38.552
a look at it before we go.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.420
Just to pay homage, huh?

08:40.453 --> 08:41.288
Yeah, what the hell.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.100
Work's been
keeping me real busy.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.768
Yeah, I hear you, man.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.303
A couple of years
ago, I hurt my back.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.739
I couldn't get back on my
wheels for almost two weeks.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.973
I made a vow, man.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.108
Whoa, never again.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.310
Well, that's what I
mean, man, you know.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.714
I mean, things come up.

09:06.747 --> 09:10.450
Uh, priorities, Dan.

09:10.483 --> 09:14.521
I got this canvas to
keep the saw dust off it.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.025
Well, you know, like I
said, uh, things come up.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.296
It could use a little work.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.798
I got the front
wheel right here,

09:24.832 --> 09:29.770
and, uh, could polish up
the chrome a little bit.

09:29.803 --> 09:30.838
It'd probably start right up.

09:30.871 --> 09:31.672
Dan.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.343
Danny, man.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.779
You should of called.

09:38.812 --> 09:42.082
[music playing]

09:47.955 --> 09:49.589
Hey, you've still
got the knack, sis.

09:49.623 --> 09:53.126
Well, some things
you never lose.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.428
And some things you lose
to the wrong person.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.067
Yo!

10:00.100 --> 10:01.234
To youth.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.970
(IN UNISON) To youth.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.773
And all the fun and stupidity
that goes along with it.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.446
Give me some quarters, would ya?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.348
Yeah, wait a minute,
what are you going to play?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.917
- I know what to play.
- Whoa, no, wait a minute.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.518
You're gonna play E9.
- What's wrong with E9.

10:18.551 --> 10:19.753
Wait a minute,
they're my quarters.

10:19.787 --> 10:23.891
God, do you have to
be such a big baby?

10:23.924 --> 10:29.663
So, Jacks, what
you been doing?

10:29.697 --> 10:32.232
I'm a cop.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.100
Cop.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.302
Uh-huh, Since November.

10:35.335 --> 10:38.071
Since November?

10:38.105 --> 10:44.945
[laughs] You
always had a really

10:44.978 --> 10:46.413
out there sense of humor, man.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.781
What are you talking about?

10:47.815 --> 10:48.882
I don't know.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.284
I mean, like, like,
telling me you're a cop.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.485
No, I am.

10:52.519 --> 10:56.356
I'm a police woman for
the Lanford police force.

10:56.389 --> 11:02.562
[laughs] So, what
have you been doing?

11:02.595 --> 11:04.932
Roseanne, what do
I do for a living?

11:04.965 --> 11:07.334
Well, you better
not drink no more.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.736
No.
Look.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.703
There.

11:09.737 --> 11:10.838
That's my badge, OK?

11:10.871 --> 11:12.072
Now you believe me?

11:12.105 --> 11:15.642
Or you still think I'm
messing with your mind, man?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.110
Ooh.

11:17.144 --> 11:20.047
[laughs]

11:20.080 --> 11:22.182
What is so damn funny?

11:22.215 --> 11:23.751
Why can't you just accept
what I'm telling you?

11:23.784 --> 11:24.918
I'm a cop.
- You're a cop.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.419
- I went to the Academy.
- Went to the Academy.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.921
- In Springfield.
- Ooh, Springfield.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.022
I busted my tail
for six weeks!

11:29.056 --> 11:30.357
Yeah, six weeks?

11:30.390 --> 11:31.792
I could pick up a man, and
throw him against the wall.

11:31.825 --> 11:32.760
Do it!

11:32.793 --> 11:33.727
Because I'm a police woman!

11:33.761 --> 11:34.627
Right!

11:34.661 --> 11:35.695
That's what I do!

11:35.729 --> 11:36.663
Love it!

11:36.696 --> 11:37.865
Yeah!

11:37.898 --> 11:42.169
[laughs] You got this down
on Rush street, right?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.103
There.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.037
Now you believe me?

11:47.274 --> 11:48.141
Great.

11:48.175 --> 11:48.976
Great!

11:52.746 --> 11:54.247
- Want to play pool?
- Sure.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.382
Here.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.051
Here's the keys in case
you want to uncuff him.

11:58.085 --> 12:01.554
[sighs] What did I
ever see in that guy?

12:01.588 --> 12:02.756
I don't know.

12:02.790 --> 12:06.359
I think you kept your
eyes closed all the time.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.796
What is it with
guys on motorcycles?

12:08.829 --> 12:12.332
Well, speaking
as a young girl,

12:12.365 --> 12:14.534
you know for certain that's
the one thing that's really

12:14.567 --> 12:16.003
gonna freak your parents out.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.038
And that is a big plus.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.472
Big plus.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.708
God, you know, but
I, just, used to love

12:21.741 --> 12:23.376
riding on that thing with Dan.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.345
I mean, just that
feeling, you know?

12:25.378 --> 12:29.316
It was like-- it was like
danger and freedom and sex.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.384
And it was all
rolled up into one.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.953
He used to come and
pick me up on his bike

12:32.986 --> 12:35.488
and we would just, like,
blast off and hit the highway.

12:35.522 --> 12:36.957
And we'd just be flying.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.259
God, it was so much.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.161
Yeah.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.963
[sighs] I really miss that.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.769
Danny, be straight
with me, man.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.604
Hey, come on, just
because we haven't seen

12:51.638 --> 12:53.406
each other for 20 years
doesn't mean I'm not

12:53.440 --> 12:56.209
still your best friend, man.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.311
What happened to you, man?

12:58.345 --> 13:00.147
What happened to Rosie?

13:00.180 --> 13:02.916
What happened to
that '55 Pan, man?

13:02.950 --> 13:04.818
Hey, man, I got three kids.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.019
Yeah, so?

13:06.053 --> 13:07.420
I got two kids.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.856
And three motorcycles.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.858
I'm trying to
start a business.

13:10.891 --> 13:11.758
Yeah?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.193
I'm trying to buy a home.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.094
Yeah?

13:14.127 --> 13:14.928
I caved.

13:18.765 --> 13:21.935
Man, I was hoping you and your
old lady would come packing up

13:21.969 --> 13:24.838
to the Sturgis run this summer.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.439
I can't go to Sturgis.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.009
Come on, man, this is
the year to go, you know?

13:29.042 --> 13:32.812
50th anniversary of
the Black Hills run.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.915
The Queen Mama.

13:34.948 --> 13:38.185
Everybody and their dog
is going to be there.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.020
Come on, we'll
trash the Marriott.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.194
Man, you saw the bike.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.829
There's no way.

13:49.863 --> 13:52.699
Don't blame it
on the bike, man.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.002
Harley's never die.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.004
Just the owners.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.974
Aw, come on.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.944
I can't.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.278
Fine.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.179
Then sell me the bike.

14:12.085 --> 14:15.388
[music playing]

14:16.924 --> 14:19.326
ROSEANNE: Hey, that bike is
the last speck of our youth.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.094
You can't go sell that bike.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.396
DAN: Come on, Roseanne, we
don't even use it anymore.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.297
Precisely my point.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.199
That's why we ought to keep it.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.400
No.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.236
What's gotten into you?

14:29.269 --> 14:31.204
I mean, what's this kick
you're all of a sudden on.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.173
Oh, you mean this
wanting to live thing?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.307
Ha ha.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.708
You know, when I was
going out with you, Dan,

14:35.742 --> 14:39.112
and believe it or not, we
did go out all the time--

14:39.146 --> 14:41.448
Make a point, Roseanne.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.216
It's just-- you
know, I just used

14:43.250 --> 14:44.751
to love the sound of that bike.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.719
I could hear it, like,
a block away, you know?

14:46.753 --> 14:49.056
And I-- I knew that you
were going to be coming

14:49.089 --> 14:51.024
and showing up any second.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.161
That bike was like my favorite
sound in the entire world.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.863
That bike's where
we fell in love.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.832
Oh, we're still in love.

14:59.866 --> 15:02.502
We don't need no
bike to be in love.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.005
Yeah, but, I mean, when we
were riding on that bike, Dan,

15:05.038 --> 15:06.373
we were free.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.708
Baby, that's not us any more.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.809
Yeah, no kidding.

15:09.842 --> 15:12.712
We are as dusty and old
as that bike itself.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.981
Come on, Roseanne.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.615
It's true, Dan.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.618
Nobody ever comes and
takes us out for a spin.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.221
Spin?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.256
When we have time to
go out for a spin?

15:23.290 --> 15:25.092
Well, we don't even
do nothing any more.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.126
I mean, we don't travel.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.527
We don't do nothing.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.230
We lock ourselves up here in the
living room in front of the TV.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.299
And then we go to work.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.034
I mean, we used to
be Dan and Roseanne.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.435
We're still Dan and Roseanne.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.336
No we're not.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.937
We're the Conners.

15:37.971 --> 15:42.575
Like the Bells, and the
Hacketts, and the Joneses.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.811
I like being the Conners.

15:44.844 --> 15:45.878
Don't sell the bike.

15:45.912 --> 15:48.115
I love that bike
as much as you do.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.282
But right now it's
a piece of junk,

15:49.316 --> 15:50.984
and it's taking
up a lot of space.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.686
And we need the money.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.856
And wouldn't you rather be
Dan and Roseanne in the black?

15:56.889 --> 15:57.690
Geezer!

16:00.760 --> 16:04.164
[music playing]

16:27.154 --> 16:28.555
ROSEANNE: He's in here, Zig.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.325
Ziggy is here to
pick up the bike.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.226
Yeah, I was just
looking for stock parts.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.127
Hey, Zig.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.295
ZIGGY: Hey, man.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.397
I found the fenders and
the, uh, Fat Bob tank.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.365
I couldn't find the cap.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.632
No problem.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.334
Well, I want to make sure
you get everything I got.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.803
Yeah, great.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.505
This OK with you, Rosie?

16:45.538 --> 16:49.409
I mean, you know I'll take
real good care of her, right?

16:49.442 --> 16:50.310
Yeah.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.180
Hey, baby.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.081
You remember this?

17:00.187 --> 17:00.987
Yeah.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.798
OK, I, uh, made this
up for half the amount.

17:11.831 --> 17:14.267
And then I wrote one
out for the other half.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.536
It'll be good in three weeks.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.370
OK?

17:26.113 --> 17:27.147
I can't do it.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.149
I can't sell you the bike.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.483
I-- I thought I could.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.384
I can't sell it.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.519
It's too much of my past.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.020
Forget the past, man.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.288
Zig, I'm not gonna
sell ya the bike.

17:35.322 --> 17:36.556
That's all.
- Hey, fine, OK?

17:36.589 --> 17:38.658
I'm not saying you
should sell me the bike.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.559
That's great.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.294
Cool, don't sell me the bike.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.796
But don't do it because you're
hanging onto the past, man.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.299
Do it because you're
gonna get back on it, OK?

17:46.333 --> 17:48.268
You've been riding
that sofa too long.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.769
I'm not a teenager
anymore, all right, man?

17:49.802 --> 17:50.737
I'm not in high school!

17:50.770 --> 17:51.671
Hey, neither am I, man!

17:51.704 --> 17:52.605
OK?

17:52.639 --> 17:55.007
I haven't been in
study hall for--

17:55.041 --> 17:56.075
20 years.

18:03.383 --> 18:07.587
Man, I'm talking about
shutting down inside.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.556
You don't get dust
on the fenders

18:09.589 --> 18:11.191
until you shut off the engine.

18:18.731 --> 18:22.735
Well, what do you think it'd
take to get her going again?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.404
Phone call to
my old lady saying

18:24.437 --> 18:25.438
I'll be another few days.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.309
What about work, man?

18:29.342 --> 18:31.511
I thought you had
to get back to work.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.681
Well, that was before
I had bike to rebuild.

18:42.489 --> 18:48.161
Hey, I appreciate this.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.663
Hey, priorities, man.

18:54.701 --> 18:58.037
[music playing]

19:03.142 --> 19:04.010
DAN: Come on!

19:04.043 --> 19:05.011
Come on!

19:05.044 --> 19:06.413
Come on, DJ.
Come on.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.847
You'd think they
were unveiling

19:07.880 --> 19:09.616
the Statue of Liberty.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.251
This is better than
the Statue of Liberty.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.519
Yeah, it moves.

Purchased with the money she
stole from her mother's purse.

19:27.634 --> 19:28.501
Nice threads.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.602
Why, thank you.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.937
Well, let's see it!

Ladies and gentlemen, members
of the press, distinguished

19:33.840 --> 19:37.644
scientist, members of
NASA, members of my family,

19:37.677 --> 19:39.946
I'm proud to present
the seed of passion

19:39.979 --> 19:41.281
on which this family was found.

19:44.451 --> 19:45.885
Check it out.

ROSEANNE: [screams]

19:53.226 --> 19:54.193
Can I sit on it?

19:54.227 --> 19:56.763
Get away from there!

19:56.796 --> 19:59.699
Honey, I want you to sit it.

20:10.943 --> 20:15.615
All right, the shocks held!

20:15.648 --> 20:19.051
Hey, Roseanne, you
want a ride home?

20:21.788 --> 20:24.624
Oh, my folks don't allow
me to ride on motorcycles.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.764
I mean, I mean,
hey man, don't let

20:31.798 --> 20:33.533
your ancestors bum your trip.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.506
I'm not sure that I should.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.174
Take a chance to be with me.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.285
Uh, what are your
rebelling against, Danny?

20:55.755 --> 20:58.057
What've you got?
