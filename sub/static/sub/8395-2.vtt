00:00.720 --> 00:03.029
MILLIE, I JUST
STOOD UP TOO FAST.

00:03.070 --> 00:04.139
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL

00:04.170 --> 00:06.058
TO SORT THIS OUT--YOU BASICALLY
HAD A HEART ATTACK.

00:06.100 --> 00:08.660
I HAD AN EVENT,
AND THE EVENT IS OVER.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.034
I DIDN'T REALIZE
I WAS SO UPSET.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.141
YOUR MOM SPENT EVERY OUNCE
OF HER ENERGY MAKING THIS DREAM

00:19.190 --> 00:22.353
HAPPEN FOR YOU AND OTHER KIDS
LIKE YOU.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.492
I'M PREGNANT.

00:26.640 --> 00:27.504
OH.

00:35.480 --> 00:36.686

- OKAY, RIGHT.

01:08.680 --> 01:12.616
HOW LONG?
HOW FAR ALONG?

01:12.650 --> 01:16.347
LIKE TWO MONTHS.

01:16.380 --> 01:19.315
SO YOU'RE KEEPING IT?

01:19.350 --> 01:21.102
I KNOW IT SEEMS CRAZY.

01:21.150 --> 01:23.414
I KNOW IT'S CRAZY,
BUT I--

01:23.460 --> 01:25.212
- YOU'RE KEEPING IT.
- I WANT TO KEEP IT.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.832

01:27.880 --> 01:31.281
I THINK IT'S RIGHT.

01:31.330 --> 01:32.354
GOOD.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.152
I THINK IT'S RIGHT.

01:34.190 --> 01:35.566
GOOD.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.424
[phone buzzes]

02:06.220 --> 02:07.630
HEY.
EVERYTHING OKAY?

02:07.670 --> 02:09.843
HEY.
AM I CATCHING YOU AT A BAD TIME?

02:09.880 --> 02:11.507
NO. I JUST
CAME INTO THE OFFICE EARLY.

02:11.540 --> 02:12.848
OH, SORRY.

02:12.890 --> 02:15.814
YEAH, I WAS JUST THINKING WE
SHOULD TALK ABOUT,

02:15.850 --> 02:17.715
YOU KNOW, THIS E-MAIL FROM SYD'S
TEACHER.

02:17.750 --> 02:18.921
I DIDN'T SEE IT. WHAT'S UP?

02:18.960 --> 02:20.643
WELL, EVIDENTLY,

02:20.690 --> 02:22.851
THERE'S SOME SORT OF GIRL DRAMA
GOING DOWN AT SCHOOL.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.652
I TALKED TO SYD ABOUT IT.

02:24.690 --> 02:27.272
SHE SAID THERE'S THIS NEW GIRL
THAT'S BEEN PICKING ON HER.

02:27.310 --> 02:28.891
- OH, NO. WHAT?
- YEAH.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.862
WELL, BELIEVE ME,
I WAS READY TO GO

02:30.900 --> 02:32.242
KICK SOME LI'I'I'LE GIRL'S BU'I'I'.

02:32.290 --> 02:35.248
BUT ACCORDING TO SYD,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

02:35.290 --> 02:38.282
MRS. REESE PROBABLY JUST WANTS
US TO KNOW SHE'S ON TOP OF IT.

02:38.330 --> 02:40.321
BUT SHE DOES WANT TO SEE US,
THOUGH.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.975
OR, YOU KNOW,
ONE OF US.

02:42.020 --> 02:43.601
JUST SCHEDULE IT.
I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.289
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

02:45.330 --> 02:48.709
THAN KS.

02:48.750 --> 02:51.719
EVERYTHING OKAY?

02:52.790 --> 02:53.882
HERE'S YOUR BREAKFAST.

02:53.930 --> 02:55.716
- NO.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.988
OKAY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO HAVE THAT.

02:57.030 --> 02:59.419

02:59.450 --> 03:00.894

03:00.930 --> 03:02.272

03:03.660 --> 03:04.763
- EMILY MILLER.
- THAT'S EDGAR'S MOM.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.244
WHY IS SHE CALLING
AT THIS HOUR?

03:06.280 --> 03:07.520
I HAVE NO IDEA.
PROBABLY BECAUSE

03:07.560 --> 03:08.629
YOU GAVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER
TO EVERY SINGLE PARENT

03:08.670 --> 03:09.932
AND TOLD THEM
TO CALL AT ANY HOUR.

03:09.980 --> 03:11.868
ONE SECOND, HOLD ON.
YEAH, I CAN TALK. THE EGGS.

03:11.910 --> 03:12.660
HOLD ON.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.588

03:14.640 --> 03:16.608
AH, MAX.
WANT YOUR EGGS?

03:16.640 --> 03:17.493
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT EGGS
RIGHT NOW.

03:17.540 --> 03:18.848
WHY NOT?

03:18.880 --> 03:20.359
BECAUSE I'VE DECIDED
ON AN ART ELECT IVE.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.606
YOU HAVE?
HALLELUJAH.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.743
FINALLY. WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

03:22.780 --> 03:24.714
- PHOTOGRAPHY.
- NO, PHOTOGRAPHY
IS NOT AN OPTION.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.365
YOU RUN THE SCHOOL.
MAKE IT AN OPTION.

03:26.410 --> 03:27.479
WE CAN ABSOLUTELY
ADDRESS THIS.

03:27.510 --> 03:28.613
TECHNICALLY, YOUR MOTHER
RUNS THE SCHOOL.

03:28.650 --> 03:29.719
YOUR PROBLEM IS OUR PROBLEM.

03:29.760 --> 03:30.852
THEN SHE SHOULD MAKE
IT AN OPTION.

03:30.900 --> 03:31.787
THERE ARE YOUR EGGS.
HONEY, I GOT TO GO.

03:31.830 --> 03:33.206
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.161
JUST WAIT ONE SECOND.
I WILL DISCUSS THIS WITH
MY HUSBAND RIGHT NOW.

03:34.210 --> 03:35.586
I GOT A MEETING I GO'I'I'A GET
OUTI'A HERE.

03:35.620 --> 03:36.723
THANK YOU, OKAY.
BYE, EMILY.

03:36.760 --> 03:40.548
OKAY, EDGAR'S NUTRITIONIST
WANTS TO TAKE HIM OFF CASEIN

03:40.590 --> 03:42.000
AND GLUTEN.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.860
OKAY. WELL, I'M GLAD
SHE CALLED US AT 7:00
AM. TO TELL US THAT.

03:43.910 --> 03:46.287
WELL, SHE HAD TO, BECAUSE IT
REFLECT S IN HIS SCHOOL LUNCHES,

03:46.320 --> 03:47.355
WHICH WE HAVE TO HELP MANAGE.

03:47.390 --> 03:48.322
- GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
- NO, PLEASE.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.327
CAN YOU PLEASE DO ME A FAVOR?

03:49.360 --> 03:50.668
NO, NO, NO, NO, I CAN'T.

03:50.710 --> 03:51.779
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA ASK YOU.

03:51.810 --> 03:52.708
I DO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME.

03:52.740 --> 03:54.298
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

03:54.330 --> 03:55.570
YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME
TO CALL THE LUNCH VENDOR,

03:55.610 --> 03:56.884
AND I'M SLAMMED TODAY ALREADY.
I GOT TO GO.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.399
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT YOU'RE SO GOOD AT IT.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.749
ONLY BECAUSE I DON'T ASK THEM
TO DO CRAZY THINGS,

04:00.790 --> 04:02.337
LIKE TAKE ALL THE CASEIN
OUT OF ONE KID'S LUNCH.

04:02.380 --> 04:03.608
- IT'S "CASE-IN."
- IT'S "CAY-SEEN."

04:03.650 --> 04:05.857
- WHY DID WE FOUND THIS SCHOOL?
- TO BE A FASCIST INSTITUTION.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.026
TO MEET THE NEEDS
OF EVERY STUDENT.

04:07.070 --> 04:08.446
IT'S NOT FASCIST.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.754
IT'S CAPITALISM.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.483
- NO, THAT'S FASCISM.
- IT'S ALL
WE CAN AFFORD RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

04:11.520 --> 04:12.862
TH REE ELECT IVES.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.834
YOU FOUNDED CHAMBERS ACADEMY
TO MEET THE NEEDS OF EVERY
STUDENT.

04:14.870 --> 04:16.451
MY ARTISTIC NEEDS
ARE NOT BEING MET.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.934
I DON'T WANT TO INTERFERE
WITH THIS STUDENT-HEADMASTER

04:17.980 --> 04:19.663
CONFERENCE,
SO I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.

04:19.700 --> 04:20.667

04:20.700 --> 04:21.667
SO YOU'LL CALL THE VENDOR?

04:21.700 --> 04:22.803
I'M LATE.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.080
I GOT TO GO. I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.088
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.
[door closes]

04:26.120 --> 04:28.634
GUYS, TAKE A SECOND
AND ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MOMENT.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.819
DON'T LET IT PASS YOU BY.

04:30.850 --> 04:32.841
YOU'RE ABOUT TO LAY DOWN
YOUR DEBUT TRACK

04:32.890 --> 04:34.334
ON HALLOWED GROUND,

04:34.370 --> 04:37.407
IN A PLACE WHERE LEGENDS
WERE MADE OF SONGWRITERS,

04:37.440 --> 04:40.682
WHERE ICONS WERE MADE
OUT OF SINGERS. OKAY?

04:40.720 --> 04:42.347
YOU'RE SI'I'I'ING,
RIGHT NOW,

04:42.380 --> 04:45.508
WHERE JANIS JOPLIN
ACTUALLY RECORDED.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.312
WHO'S JANIS JOPLIN?

04:47.350 --> 04:49.033
YOU KNOW WHAT,
OUT OF MY STUDIO.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.832
GO ON AND JUST GET OUT.

04:50.870 --> 04:52.519
I'M JUST KIDDING.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.357
IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S FAULT.
LISTEN TO ME.

04:54.390 --> 04:56.950
GUYS, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS SING IN YOUR NORMAL VOICES.

04:56.980 --> 04:58.902
THE MICS WILL PICK IT UP.
JUST REMEMBER YOUR MOTIVATION,

04:58.950 --> 05:00.986
WHICH IS?
BE CUTE--

05:01.020 --> 05:03.056
ESPECIALLY YOU, MAX--

05:03.090 --> 05:06.127
AND WISH YOUR GRANDFATHER A
VERY, VERY HAPPY 72ND BIRTHDAY.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.469
WE SHOULD RECORD HIS BIRTHDAY
SONG WITH A FULL BAND.

05:08.510 --> 05:10.569
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
WHEN HE TURNS 80, WE'LL DO THAT,

05:10.620 --> 05:11.928
THE WHOLE THING.
ANY QUESTIONS?

05:11.960 --> 05:14.474
CAN YOU SIGN A FORM
STATING THAT THIS COUNTS
AS MY ART ELECT IVE?

05:14.520 --> 05:16.897
THAT'S ABSURD.
I CANNOT DO THAT.

05:16.930 --> 05:17.919
THEN I AM NOT SINGING.

05:17.970 --> 05:19.619
- HERE WE GO, FIVE, SIX...
- I'M NOT GONNA SING.

05:19.660 --> 05:21.548
SEVEN, EIGHT...

05:21.590 --> 05:24.696
all:
I CAN CHANGE THE WORLD

05:24.730 --> 05:27.802
WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS

05:27.840 --> 05:31.662
MAKE A BETTER PLACE

05:31.710 --> 05:34.110
WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS

05:34.160 --> 05:38.051
MAKE A KINDER PLACE

05:38.090 --> 05:41.082
WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS

05:50.620 --> 05:52.997
OKAY.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.794
YOUR DIAGNOSTICS
SHOW MULTIPLE BLOCKAGES.

05:56.830 --> 05:57.899
BUT I STILL DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT CAUSED YOU

05:57.940 --> 05:59.862
TO COLLAPSE.

05:59.910 --> 06:03.698
I ALSO SAW SOME SIGNIFICANT
MITRAL REGURGITATION.

06:03.740 --> 06:06.732
NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION.

06:06.780 --> 06:09.180
GUYS,
WE SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS

06:09.230 --> 06:11.186
WORKING WITH JUST DIET
AND MEDICATION.

06:11.230 --> 06:13.050
YEAH, BUT HE COULD STILL
DO A LOT BE'I'I'ER WITH THE DIET.

06:13.090 --> 06:16.025
OH, I KNOW.
YEAH, I MEAN, BUT I QUIT CIGARS.
THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

06:16.060 --> 06:17.288
AND THAT'S GREAT.

06:17.340 --> 06:22.095
BUT EVEN WITH THE PERFECT DIET,
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.823
I'M AFRAID IT'S TIME
TO TALK ABOUT SURGERY.

06:23.860 --> 06:25.407
OH, MAN.

06:25.450 --> 06:30.001
SEE, SURGERY WAS ALWAYS
A LAST OPTION IN YOUR OPINION.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.031
IT IS. AND IT'S TIME
TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER IT.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.729
THIS WAS NO BIG DEAL.

06:33.770 --> 06:36.591
I MEAN, WAS SHORT OF BREATH.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.621
I STOOD UP TOO FAST.
THAT'S ALL.

06:38.670 --> 06:41.798
NO.
YOU WERE JUST LUCKY.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.159
LUCKY YOU WEREN'T ALONE
WHEN IT HAPPENED

06:43.190 --> 06:45.112
AND LUCKY IT WAS
JUST A CLEAN FALL.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.845
LELAND,
IT WAS NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

06:47.890 --> 06:51.223
ZEEK, THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

06:51.270 --> 06:53.158
AND IF YOU'RE DRIVING
WHEN IT DOES,

06:53.200 --> 06:56.681
OR YOU SMACK YOUR HEAD
ON THE PAVEMENT WHEN YOU FALL,

06:56.720 --> 07:00.542
THEN, MY FRIEND,
BEEN NICE KNOWING YOU.

07:08.490 --> 07:11.141
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG
WE WERE SMALL

07:11.180 --> 07:14.638
BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW IT

07:14.670 --> 07:18.538
AH-AH-AH

07:18.570 --> 07:21.152
WHEN YOU WERE HURT
YOU WOULD SMILE

07:21.190 --> 07:24.842
SO YOU DIDN'T SHOW IT

07:24.890 --> 07:28.542
AH-AH-AH

07:28.580 --> 07:32.266
AND I

07:32.310 --> 07:35.473
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MINE

07:39.970 --> 07:42.905
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MINE

07:44.980 --> 07:48.256
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MINE

07:53.920 --> 07:57.128
SO, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

07:57.160 --> 07:59.674
I'M THINKING THAT LELAND
WOULD LIKE TO BUY HIMSELF

07:59.720 --> 08:02.097
A NEW VACATION PLACE
IS WHAT I'M THINKING.

08:02.130 --> 08:04.052
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

08:04.100 --> 08:06.512
I'M THINKING
WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.

08:06.550 --> 08:08.893
- UH-HUH. OKAY.
- YEAH.

08:08.930 --> 08:10.750
- THERE YOU GO.
- NO, I'M DRIVING.

08:10.800 --> 08:15.555
NO, I'M DRIVING.
I'M DRIVING.

08:15.590 --> 08:17.933
GOSH.

08:17.980 --> 08:20.972
TAKE AWAY MY DRIVING PRIVILEGES,
MY GOD.

08:21.010 --> 08:22.807
BUT HE WAS IN
A FULL BODY CAST.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.319
I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO THINK ABOUT THE DETAILS

08:24.360 --> 08:26.180
AS MUCH AS YOU APPARENTLY DO.

08:26.220 --> 08:27.494
- WE WERE THERE.
- WE WEREN'T THERE.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.223
- WE WOULD'VE HEARD SOMETHING.
- WHY WOULD WE HAVE HEARD THEM?

08:29.260 --> 08:30.943
WE WERE IN A HOTEL,
LIKE, A MILLION MILES AWAY.

08:30.990 --> 08:32.264
YOU KNOW, HE WAS ATTACHED
TO A HEART MONITOR.

08:32.300 --> 08:33.915
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN GOING OFF.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.747
LOOK, ALL I KNOW
IS THAT MY DAUGHTER'S PREGNANT.

08:36.790 --> 08:39.258
AND SHE WAS SO SCARED TOO.
SHE WAS SO SCARED TO TELL ME.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.642
AND I JUST FROZE.

08:41.690 --> 08:47.299
I-I BET SHE DREAMED
OF THIS WONDERFUL MOMENT

08:47.350 --> 08:50.274
WHERE SHE TELLS HER MOM
THIS EXCITING NEWS,

08:50.320 --> 08:52.834
AND I TOTALLY LET HER DOWN.

08:52.870 --> 08:57.637
I JUST SAID, "OH."

09:00.220 --> 09:01.255
HE WAS IN TRACTION,

09:01.290 --> 09:02.769
YOU KNOW.
MAYBE THAT HELPS.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.778
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S NOT THE POINT.

09:04.820 --> 09:07.778
I KNOW.
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

09:07.820 --> 09:10.027
HOW DO YOU...

09:10.060 --> 09:12.620
HOW DO YOU REALLY FEEL
ABOUT IT?

09:16.720 --> 09:20.304
I THINK...

09:20.350 --> 09:23.968
I THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I FEEL.

09:24.010 --> 09:26.240
SHE NEEDS ME.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.316
- HEY, CROSBY.
- WHAT?

09:28.360 --> 09:29.384
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DO THE 11:00 AM.

09:29.430 --> 09:30.385
OLIVER ROME THING
BY YOURSELF.

09:30.430 --> 09:32.045
I GOT TO GO,
ALL RIGHT?

09:32.080 --> 09:33.729
WHAT, ARE YOU PUTTING SCHOOL
AHEAD OF LUNCHEONETTE AGAIN?

09:33.780 --> 09:35.213
YOU CAN'T DO THAT, MAN.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.181
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT THE LUNCHEONETTE.

09:36.230 --> 09:37.185
THIS IS ABOUT OUR FATHER.

09:37.230 --> 09:38.709
I HAVE TO GO TALK TO OUR DAD.

09:38.750 --> 09:40.058
- FOR WHAT?
- HE'S A STUBBORN ASS.

09:40.090 --> 09:41.318
MOM SAID HE WON'T EVEN
CONSIDER HAVING THE SURGERY.

09:41.370 --> 09:43.258
- WHAT SURGERY?
- HIS HEART SURGERY,

09:43.300 --> 09:45.120
TO CORRECT HIS MITRAL
REGURGITATION; I GOT TO GO.

09:45.170 --> 09:46.125
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
LIKE I KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.239
I NEVER HEARD THAT.

09:47.270 --> 09:48.191
HOW DO YOU
NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS?

09:48.240 --> 09:49.400
DAD'S HAVING HEART SURGERY?

09:49.450 --> 09:50.610
HE'S REFUSING
TO HAVE THE HEART SURGERY.

09:50.650 --> 09:51.651
I THOUGHT MOM TOLD YOU
ABOUT THIS.

09:51.690 --> 09:52.964
MOM DID NOT TELL ME
ABOUT THIS,

09:53.000 --> 09:54.069
WHICH IS THE PATTERN
OF BEHAVIOR

09:54.110 --> 09:55.065
WHERE SHE TREATS ME
LIKE THE BABY,

09:55.110 --> 09:57.897
AND SHE HIDES THIS KIND
OF MEDICAL SITUATION.

09:57.940 --> 09:59.760
CAN WE NOT MAKE THIS ABOUT YOU
RIGHT NOW? THIS IS SERIOUS.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.109
HOW WOULD I KNOW IT'S SERIOUS?
NOBODY'S TELLING ME A THING.

10:02.150 --> 10:03.310
OKAY, I GOT TO GO.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.351
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
BEFORE YOU GO!

10:05.390 --> 10:07.210
YOU CAN'T BE IN THAT BIG
OF A HURRY!

10:07.260 --> 10:09.660
THE CARDIOLOGIST WANTS TO DO
A CORONARY BYPASS

10:09.710 --> 10:11.223
AND A MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT,
OKAY?

10:11.260 --> 10:12.943
THAT'S OPEN-HEART SURGERY.

10:12.990 --> 10:15.083
YES, I KNOW, AND THAT'S
WHY I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HIM.

10:15.130 --> 10:16.916
- WELL, HE'S GOT TO DO IT.
- YEAH, HE IS GONNA DO IT.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.097
I'M GONNA MAKE HIM DO IT.
I'M GONNA TALK TO HIM.

10:18.130 --> 10:19.290
YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE.

10:19.340 --> 10:20.238
- I'M GOING WITH YOU.
- I DON'T NEED YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

10:20.270 --> 10:22.306
YES, I'M COMING WITH YOU.
IT'S OUR FATHER.

10:22.340 --> 10:23.682
HE'S GOT YOU WRAPPED
AROUND HIS LITTLE FINGER.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.164
HE'S GONNA TRY
AND GET YOU TO FLIP TO HIS SIDE.

10:25.210 --> 10:25.960
YOU'LL DO IT IN TWO SECONDS.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.274
- THAT IS NOT TRUE.
- IT IS TRUE.

10:27.310 --> 10:29.062
THAT IS NOT TRUE.
I WILL BE THE HAMMER.

10:29.110 --> 10:32.136
YOU'LL BE QUIET.
I WILL DO ALL THE TALKING.

10:34.350 --> 10:36.409
HEY, JIM.
HOW ARE YOU?
YOU'RE HERE--

10:36.460 --> 10:38.109
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

10:38.150 --> 10:41.119
YES, THIS IS THE E-MAIL
I SENT YOU ABOUT EDGAR MILLER

10:41.150 --> 10:42.777
AND THE CASEIN AND--

10:42.810 --> 10:46.325
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?
- THIS IS OUR CONTRACT, YES,
FOR THE CHAMBERS ACADEMY.

10:46.360 --> 10:48.089
CORRECT AGAIN.

10:48.130 --> 10:50.269
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?
THAT WAS REALLY RUDE.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.949
WHY ARE YOU BREAKING THINGS?

10:51.990 --> 10:54.436
EVERY SINGLE DAY THERE'S
SOME CRAZY NEW REQUEST FROM YOU.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.096
NO GLUTEN, NO DAIRY,
VEGETABLES ONLY, MEAT ONLY.

10:57.130 --> 10:59.951
I CAN'T MAKE INDIVIDUALIZED
MEALS FOR 40 KIDS.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.036
OKAY, BUT YOUR COMPANY
IS CALLED SELECT LUNCH.

11:02.070 --> 11:03.480
YOU EVEN HAVE IT ON YOUR EMBLEM.
YOU HAVE AN APPLE.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.727
YOU HAVE A CARROT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:05.760 --> 11:08.342
PLEASE, JIM, CAN YOU JUST
HELP ME FOR THIS WEEK?

11:08.390 --> 11:09.527
THAT'S IT.

11:09.560 --> 11:12.108
- I JUST CAN'T WORK WITH YOU.
- I CAN WORK WITH YOU.

11:12.150 --> 11:14.118
I'M DESPERATE HERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, FINE, LEAVE.

11:14.150 --> 11:16.015
I WILL FIND SOMEBODY ELSE
THAT WILL HELP ME.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.836
THAT CARE--
THAT CARE ABOUT CHILDREN.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.086
OH,
I DON'T CARE ABOUT KIDS, HUH?

11:19.120 --> 11:20.462
AND THEIR INTESTINAL TRACT
AND HOW THEY FEEL.

11:20.500 --> 11:21.535
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- YOU SHOULD JUST LEAVE THEN.

11:21.570 --> 11:23.219
YOU'RE CAUSING A SCENE.
I WILL FIND SOMEBODY ELSE

11:23.260 --> 11:24.773
THAT WILL DO
INDIVIDUALIZED MEALS.

11:24.820 --> 11:25.809
- I'M CAUSING A SCENE?
- YOU'RE CAUSING A SCENE.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.329
HEY, KIDS, LOOK UP.

11:27.370 --> 11:30.021
EVERYBODY, NO GLUTEN-FREE,
NO CASEIN,

11:30.060 --> 11:32.119
ZUCCHINI-KALE SANDWICHES.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

11:32.170 --> 11:34.024
WAIT TILL YOU SEE MY REVIEW
ON YELP.

11:34.070 --> 11:35.139
YEAH, THAT'LL HURT.

11:35.170 --> 11:37.445
IT'S GONNA HURT...YOU.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.448
[door slams]

11:39.490 --> 11:41.310
SORRY, KIDS.

11:41.350 --> 11:42.829
HE MUST EAT TOO MUCH GLUTEN.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.451
OR CASEIN.
WHATEVER.

11:44.490 --> 11:46.173
SO I GUESS YOU TOLD
MY HUSBAND, JOEL,

11:46.220 --> 11:49.451
THAT THERE'S BEEN
SOME PLAYGROUND DRAMA.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.253
WELL, WHAT EXACTLY DID SYDNEY
SAY HAS BEEN HAPPENING?

11:52.290 --> 11:55.157
JUST THAT SYDNEY'S BEEN, YOU
KNOW, PICKED ON A LITTLE BIT.

11:55.190 --> 11:56.805
WHICH I UNDERSTAND.
IT HAPPENS.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.989
YOU KNOW,
JEALOUSY OR WHATEVER.

11:59.020 --> 12:01.534
MR. AND MRS. GRAHAM, I'M NOT
SURE YOU HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE

12:01.580 --> 12:03.195
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

12:03.230 --> 12:05.198
MELODY IS THE GIRL
SYDNEY WAS TALKING ABOUT?

12:05.240 --> 12:07.333
- MM-HMM.
- SYDNEY HAS ZEROED IN ON HER.

12:07.380 --> 12:09.928
SHE'S BEEN QUITE AGGRESSIVE
ABOUT EXCLUDING HER.

12:09.970 --> 12:12.484
- UH...
- SORRY, UH...

12:12.520 --> 12:14.340
SO SYDNEY'S PICKING ON MELODY?

12:14.380 --> 12:16.245
I KNOW THAT KIDS
WILL BE KIDS AND ALL OF THAT,

12:16.280 --> 12:17.963
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MATTERS
OF BULLYING--

12:18.010 --> 12:19.341
BULLYING?

12:19.390 --> 12:20.834
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:20.870 --> 12:22.349
IT STARTED WHEN ONE
OF SYDNEY'S FRIENDS

12:22.390 --> 12:23.948
INVITED MELODY
TO EAT LUNCH WITH THEM.

12:23.980 --> 12:25.208
SYDNEY WOULDN'T ALLOW IT.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.012
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SHE WOULDN'T ALLOW IT?

12:27.050 --> 12:28.460
MELODY IS A LITTLE
ON THE HEAW SIDE,

12:28.500 --> 12:31.298
AND SYDNEY SAID THAT MELODY
SHOULDN'T EVEN BE EATING LUNCH.

12:31.330 --> 12:34.049
NOW SHE'S TELLING EVERYONE
NOT TO SPEAK TO HER.

12:34.090 --> 12:36.024
AND YOU SAW THIS?

12:36.060 --> 12:37.288
YES.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.433
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
MELODY IS...

12:39.480 --> 12:41.163
WELL, SHE'S DESPONDENT.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.929
HER PARENTS KEPT HER HOME
FROM SCHOOL YESTERDAY,

12:42.960 --> 12:45.269
SHE WAS SO UPSET.

12:45.310 --> 12:47.961
I'M...I'M--S--

12:48.000 --> 12:51.208
THIS IS NOT--THIS IS NOT
HOW OUR DAUGHTER BEHAVES.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.036
I'M--I'M--

12:53.080 --> 12:55.105
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.424
IF THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON AT HOME

12:56.460 --> 12:57.279
THAT I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

12:57.320 --> 13:00.209
- NO.
- IT'S BEEN A...
A TOUGH YEAR.

13:00.260 --> 13:03.229
YOU KNOW, EVERY FAMILY HAS
ITS TROUBLES, BUT WE'RE FINE.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.114
WE'RE CURRENTLY SEPARATED.

13:05.160 --> 13:10.917
AND I THINK THE KIDS
ARE A LITTLE BIT RATTLED BY IT.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.121
- I KNOW HOW TOUGH THIS MUST BE.
- YEAH.

13:13.170 --> 13:15.229
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING
THIS TO OUR ATTENTION.

13:15.270 --> 13:16.828
WE WILL DO OUR BEST
TO HANDLE IT.

13:16.860 --> 13:18.999
IT WAS REALLY NICE MEETING
YOU, MS. REESE.

13:19.030 --> 13:20.964
I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN
A BETTER SIDE OF SYDNEY,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.069
BECAUSE SHE'S A GREAT GIRL.

13:22.110 --> 13:24.510
THANK YOU.

13:31.150 --> 13:35.393
- JULIA, WE NEED TO TALK.
- YEAH, UM...

13:35.430 --> 13:37.159
I'M WORKING WITH THE KIDS
TONIGHT

13:37.190 --> 13:38.532
ON GRANDPA'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT,

13:38.570 --> 13:40.435
SO WE CAN TALK
TO HER TOMORROW NIGHT.

13:40.470 --> 13:42.256
NO, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SYD.

13:42.300 --> 13:46.339
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT US,
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.

13:46.370 --> 13:48.190
THIS IS CLEARLY
A REACTION TO THAT.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.129
- YOU THINK?
- YEAH. YEAH, I DO THINK.

13:51.170 --> 13:53.138
- YEAH.
- THIS IS NOT LIKE HER.

13:53.170 --> 13:58.619
NO. JOEL,
THIS IS NOT LIKE HER, AT ALL.

13:58.660 --> 14:00.457
YOU KNOW WHAT, MOVING OUT

14:00.490 --> 14:04.449
AND GIVING UP ON ME
WAS NOT LIKE YOU...AT ALL.

14:04.490 --> 14:05.900
COME ON.

14:05.940 --> 14:09.046
COME ON,
STAY AND TALK WITH ME, PLEASE.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.184
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

14:11.220 --> 14:14.257
I BEGGED YOU FOR A YEAR JUST
TO TALK TO ME AND TELL ME

14:14.300 --> 14:16.188
WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON,

14:16.230 --> 14:19.506
AND YOU REFUSED TO DO THAT,
AND THAT BROKE ME.

14:19.540 --> 14:22.191
AND I'M ALMOST OKAY.

14:22.240 --> 14:26.370
SO YOU CAN'T COME OVER
AND TALK TO ME ABOUT MY DAD.

14:26.410 --> 14:29.299
YOU CAN'T KISS ME. OKAY?

14:29.350 --> 14:33.275
YOU CAN'T PRETEND
LIKE YOU DIDN'T DESTROY ME,

14:33.320 --> 14:35.413
BECAUSE YOU DID.

14:35.460 --> 14:39.078
YOU DESTROYED US,
ALL OF US.

14:39.110 --> 14:41.317
I KNOW.
I'M SO SORRY.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.521
OKAY, WELL,
I'M GONNA BE OKAY.

14:43.570 --> 14:45.288
I CAN HANDLE IT.

14:45.330 --> 14:48.561
I DON'T KNOW
IF THE KIDS CAN.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.021
REMEMBER THE KEY WITH DAD,
BE DIRECT.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.062
CONFRONT THAT PROBLEM HEAD ON.
ATTACK IT.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.647
OKAY.
THANKS FOR ALL THE ADVICE.

15:00.690 --> 15:01.918
AND THIS GUY, DAD,
WHAT'S HIS FIRST NAME?

15:01.970 --> 15:04.200
- ALL RIGHT.
- 'CAUSE YOU ACT LIKE I'VE NEVER
MET THE GUY OR--

15:04.240 --> 15:06.413
I'M JUST SAYIN, DON'T LET HIM
START TALKINGHE'AFDLL GET IN YOUR

15:06.450 --> 15:08.008
DON'T LET HIM START
PLAYING MIND GAMES WITH US.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.349
OKAY, HE'S NOT A MAGICIAN
OR A HYPNOTIST.

15:10.390 --> 15:11.596
- CAN YOU CHECK THAT E-MAIL?
- YEAH, KB.

15:11.630 --> 15:14.929
- WHO'S KB?
- KRISTINA BRAVERMAN, YOUR WIFE.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.288
OH...
[phone ringing]

15:16.320 --> 15:18.356
- OH, SHE'S CALLING.
- OKAY, PICK THAT UP.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.186
OKAY, HONEY, PLEASE DON'T ASK
ME ANY QUESTIONS.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.609
I'M IN A REAL PICKLE.
I'M IN A REAL BIND RIGHT NOW.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.461
MY FOOD VENDOR JUST QUIT ON ME,
AND I'VE GOT 40 KIDS TO FEED.

15:25.510 --> 15:26.704
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.194
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT THE FOOD VENDOR?

15:28.230 --> 15:31.540
- HE JUST QUIT...
- THE FIRST THING SHE SAID
WAS NO QUESTIONS.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.377
HOW DO YOU STAY MARRIED?
IT'S A MIRACLE.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.230
AND I NEED YOU TO PICK UP
40 HOT LUNCHES FOR THE KIDS

15:35.270 --> 15:37.477
AND JUST BRING THEM HERE.
JUST BRING THEM HERE.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.033
NO. NO CAN DO.

15:39.070 --> 15:41.061
I CANNOT GO TO WHOLE FOODS.
WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO MY DAD
ABOUT HIS SURGERY.

15:41.110 --> 15:42.099
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

15:42.140 --> 15:45.007
THIS IS LIKE A DEFCON FIVE
SITUATION HERE, ADAM.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.416
DEFCON FIVE IS ACTUALLY
THE GOOD ONE.

15:46.460 --> 15:47.620
IS THAT CROSBY?

15:47.670 --> 15:48.625
DEFCON ON E--
IT'S COUNTERINTUITIVE.

15:48.670 --> 15:49.762
- YES, THAT'S CROSBY.
- YEAH.

15:49.810 --> 15:51.038
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.048
I JUST NEED HELP.
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,

15:53.090 --> 15:55.593
MAYBE-- COULD CROSBY GO TO
YOUR DAD'S AND TALK TO HIM?

15:55.640 --> 15:57.153
- YES, HE CAN, ABSOLUTELY.
- NO, HE CAN'T!

15:57.190 --> 15:59.397
- THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.
- KRISTINA, IT'S ALL GOOD.

15:59.440 --> 16:00.771
HE'S GONNA
GO OVER TO WHOLE FOODS.

16:00.820 --> 16:03.505
HE'LL GET ALL THESE DIETARY
REQUIREMENTS MET,

16:03.540 --> 16:06.100
AND I WILL HANDLE MY FATHER,
AND THANKS FOR CHECKING IN.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.018
OKAY, YES!
OKAY.

16:08.070 --> 16:09.230
OH, YOU'RE REALLY HAPPY
WITH YOURSELF NOW, AREN'T YOU?

16:09.270 --> 16:10.510
WE'LL JUST SEE
HOW WE HANDLE THIS.

16:10.550 --> 16:11.619
DON'T EVEN WORRY.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.179
KNOCK, KNOCK.

16:15.210 --> 16:16.723
HOW ARE YOU?

16:16.760 --> 16:18.239
- I'M ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH?

16:20.730 --> 16:22.618
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- I FEEL LIKE I WAS IN SHOCK,

16:22.670 --> 16:27.186
AND I DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB
NOT BEING IN SHOCK.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.428
BUT I'M EAGER TO HEAR
MORE ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

16:30.470 --> 16:33.121
WHAT YOU AND RYAN HAVE PLANNED,

16:33.160 --> 16:35.708
OR HOW YOU'RE GONNA WORK IT OUT.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.672
OH, UM...

16:37.720 --> 16:39.813
I-I DON'T KNOW.

16:39.860 --> 16:41.816
I HAVEN'T EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT.

16:41.860 --> 16:44.306
HE DOESN'T KNOW.
HE DOESN'T KNOW?

16:44.340 --> 16:45.819
NOT YET.

16:45.860 --> 16:50.240
I JUST SORT OF STARTED
TELLING PEOPLE AND EVERYTHING.
SO I HAVEN'T REALLY--

16:50.280 --> 16:51.656
'CAUSE I GUESS THAT WOULD BE

16:51.700 --> 16:54.146
A BIG PIECE IN TERMS OF
IS HE INVOLVED?

16:54.180 --> 16:55.659
DOES HE WANT TO BE INVOLVED,

16:57.670 --> 16:58.489
RIGHT.

16:58.530 --> 17:00.839
JUST ANOTHER PERSON TO HELP,
YOU KNOW.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.211
YEAH, I JUST DON'T KNOW YET,
THOUGH.

17:02.260 --> 17:03.636
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I--

17:03.670 --> 17:07.743
IT'S A WEIRD THING
WHERE YOU ARE ONE PERSON,

17:07.780 --> 17:10.647
AND THEN SUDDENLY...
YOU'RE TWO PEOPLE.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.227
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND
THE MATH OF IT.

17:12.270 --> 17:14.363
- AND THAT PERSON NEEDS YOU.
- MM-HMM.

17:14.410 --> 17:17.334
SO THERE IS SOME PLANNING
THAT HAS TO HAPPEN.

25:07.950 --> 25:09.292
- I'M NOT UPSET.
- OKAY.

25:09.330 --> 25:11.742
SYDNEY, LISTEN.
WE'RE JUST CONFUSED.

25:11.780 --> 25:13.748
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.122
WHY ARE YOU BOTH
GANGING UP ON ME?

25:15.160 --> 25:17.549
- WE'RE NOT GANGING--
- WE'RE NOT GANGING UP ON--

25:17.580 --> 25:19.059
WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE? YOU
DON'T EVEN LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

25:19.100 --> 25:19.953
DON'T TALK TO YOUR FATHER
LIKE THAT.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.615
SYDNEY.

25:21.650 --> 25:22.924
WE WANT TO HELP YOU FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.200
I'M NOT UPSET.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.343
OKAY, CALM DOWN.

25:25.380 --> 25:26.893
NO, I DON'T WANT TO CALM DOWN.

25:26.930 --> 25:28.818
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
TO YOUR TERRIBLE APARTMENT?

25:28.870 --> 25:31.623
I HATE YOU!
I HATE BOTH OF YOU!

25:39.020 --> 25:40.044
[door slams]

25:44.050 --> 25:45.563
ALL RIGHT.

25:45.610 --> 25:46.599
THAT LOOKS GOOD, HONEY.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.153
ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS INSANE.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.839
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY DAD
IS TURNING 72.

25:50.890 --> 25:54.781
I KNOW. IT'S CRAZY.
[phone rings]

25:54.820 --> 25:56.708
- WHO'S THAT?
- IT'S EDGAR'S MOM.

25:56.760 --> 25:57.681
- DON'T ANSWER THAT.
- HONEY, I HAVE TO ANSWER IT.

25:57.720 --> 25:58.926
WHAT IF IT'S IMPORTANT?

25:58.970 --> 26:00.232
OH, IT IS IMPORTANT.
SHE'S GONNA COMPLAIN

26:00.280 --> 26:01.588
THAT I USED
HER SON AS SLAVE LABOR.

26:01.620 --> 26:02.302
PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU,
DON'T ANSWER IT.

26:02.350 --> 26:03.658
OKAY.

26:03.700 --> 26:04.826
I CAN'T DEAL WITH IT.
NOT TONIGHT.

26:04.870 --> 26:05.723
- I WON'T ANSWER IT.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

26:05.770 --> 26:06.862
- OHH...
- HEY.

26:06.910 --> 26:08.104
THE TRUSSELMEN CLAN IS HERE.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.072
- HI, GUYS.
- WHERE'S THE BIRTHDAY BOY?

26:10.120 --> 26:11.041
YOU'RE THE FIRST ONES
TO ARRIVE.

26:11.080 --> 26:12.593
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT'S UP?

26:12.640 --> 26:14.255
WE'RE THE NERDY FAMILY,
FIRST HERE.

26:14.290 --> 26:16.087
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- WE'RE GONNA BE THE LAST TO
LEAVE.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.600
- HOW ARE YOU?
- WELL, WE HAD AN EPISODE
ON THE WAY HERE.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.392
THE CUTEST MEMBER
OF THE FAMILY CRAPPED HERSELF.

26:20.440 --> 26:21.816
JASMINE.

26:21.850 --> 26:23.226
JASMINE CRAPPED HERSELF.

26:23.270 --> 26:24.749
IT SMELLS REALLY BAD.
I'M SORRY.

26:24.790 --> 26:27.645
- MY BAD.
- IT'S BAD.
I WILL TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.022
I HAVE SOME CLOTHES
OF NORA'S YOU CAN BORROW.

26:29.070 --> 26:31.300
YEAH.
I COULD HARDLY TELL.

26:31.340 --> 26:32.329
WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN
IN THE CAR WITH US.

26:32.380 --> 26:34.792
JABBAR, COME ON,
I HAVE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

26:34.830 --> 26:36.377
- OKAY.
- YEAH, MOVE IT.

26:36.420 --> 26:39.628
72. IS THAT--
THAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER?

26:39.660 --> 26:41.218
- YEAH.
- I JUST SAW HIM,

26:41.250 --> 26:42.899
AND HE DOESN'T LOOK A DAY
OVER 50 IF YOU ASK ME.

26:42.940 --> 26:45.079
TOUGH TO BELIEVE.

26:45.120 --> 26:48.908
HEY, I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR
HANDLING THE SITUATION WITH DAD.

26:48.950 --> 26:52.078
OH, YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
HAPPY I COULD--

26:52.120 --> 26:54.816
I HAVE TO ADMIT, I WAS
A LITTLE DOUBTFUL YOU WERE GONNA
BE ABLE TO HANDLE HIM.

26:54.850 --> 26:58.741
- OH, YOU WERE?
- YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD
BE ABLE TO GET HIM OVER THE HUMP

26:58.780 --> 26:59.815
AND TALK HIM INTO THE SURGERY,

26:59.850 --> 27:01.124
BUT GOT THAT TEXT SAYING
"ALL GOOD."

27:01.170 --> 27:04.162
IT WAS A BIG RELIEF.

27:04.200 --> 27:07.021
YE--UM--I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE
A DIFFERENT IDEA

27:07.070 --> 27:08.890
OF WHAT "ALL GOOD" MEANS.

27:08.930 --> 27:11.307
- SUGAR-FREE...
- WOW...

27:11.350 --> 27:14.319
GLUTEN-FREE, NO CHOLESTEROL.

27:14.350 --> 27:16.272
IT'S A COMPLETELY HEART-HEALTHY
ALTERNATIVE

27:16.320 --> 27:17.696
TO THE CHOCOLATE BIRTHDAY CAKE.

27:17.730 --> 27:19.209
IT'S BEAUTIFUL, JULES.

27:19.250 --> 27:20.421
- WELL DONE.
- I TRIED THE FILLING.

27:20.460 --> 27:22.007
IT SUCKS.

27:22.050 --> 27:24.189
SYDNEY.

27:24.220 --> 27:25.972
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME
WORKING ON THAT.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.056
SO WHAT?
IT'S STILL DISGUSTING.

27:28.090 --> 27:30.706
- OKAY.
- RRROW!

27:30.750 --> 27:32.957
SO SHE'S...
GOING THROUGH A THING.

27:32.990 --> 27:34.469
- YEAH.
- YOU KNOW.

27:34.510 --> 27:36.262
- IT'S THAT AGE.
- YEAH.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.471
IT'S SO--YOU KNOW,
IT'S NORMAL.

27:37.510 --> 27:40.161
GIRLS ARE WAY MORE DRAMATIC
THAN BOYS.

27:40.210 --> 27:41.928
THAT IS FOR SURE,
FOR SURE.

27:41.970 --> 27:43.722
- THANK YOU.
- SURE.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.967
UNCLE ADAM AND UNCLE CROSBY
ARE YELLING AT EACH OTHER.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.241
- BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HANDLE IT.
- ACCORDING TO YOUR GAME PLAN.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.487
YOU LET DAD STEAMROLL YOU,
LIKE ALWAYS.

27:50.530 --> 27:52.316
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
RESPECT ING SOMEONE'S WISHES

27:52.360 --> 27:53.930
AND GETTING STEAMROLLED.

27:53.980 --> 27:55.311
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

27:55.360 --> 27:57.043
HE WANTS TO MICROMANAGE
DAD'S ILLNESS FOR HIM,

27:57.080 --> 27:58.707
JUST LIKE EVERY OVER THING
IN THIS FAMILY.

27:58.740 --> 27:59.946
CROSBY DOESN'T THINK
DAD HAS TO HAVE HIS SURGERY.

27:59.980 --> 28:02.016
CROSBY,
HE HAS TO HAVE THE SURGERY.

28:02.050 --> 28:03.369
OH, WHAT A SHOCKER.
YOU TWO ARE IN--

28:03.400 --> 28:04.298
SEE, JULIA GETS IT.

28:04.330 --> 28:05.911
WHAT WERE YOU TALKING TO HIM
ABOUT IT FOR?

28:05.960 --> 28:06.984
I THOUGHT YOU HANDLED THIS.

28:07.030 --> 28:08.338
I HAD AN EMERGENCY.

28:08.370 --> 28:09.576
I COULDN'T DO IT.

28:09.610 --> 28:11.259
- WHAT WAS THE EMERGENCY?
- A BIGGER EMERGENCY THAN THIS.

28:11.310 --> 28:13.301
YEAH, THE EMERGENCY WAS ANNA
NEEDED BROCCOLI FOR LUNCH.

28:13.340 --> 28:15.092
SHE COULDN'T EAT A YAM
OR SOMETHING.

28:15.140 --> 28:16.402
- SHE HAD A GLUTEN PROBLEM.
- OH, A GLUTEN PROBLEM.

28:16.450 --> 28:18.031
THAT'S UP THERE
WITH HEART FAILURE.

28:18.070 --> 28:19.719
- YOU JUST MADE THIS...
- WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.068
- HARDER FOR EVERYBODY.
- WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS.

28:21.110 --> 28:22.759
WE NEED A STRATEGY IN PLACE,
BECAUSE--

28:22.800 --> 28:24.415
LOOK, IT'S AN ELECT IVE
PROCEDURE.

28:24.460 --> 28:26.075
YEAH,
IT'S AN ELECT IVE PROCEDURE,

28:26.110 --> 28:27.907
BUT HE'S NOT GONNA ELECT
TO DO IT, BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.931
DON'T YOU GET THAT?

28:33.290 --> 28:35.281
GREAT.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.920
ANYBODY GONNA WISH ME
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY?

28:45.960 --> 28:47.302
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD.
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

28:47.340 --> 28:50.059
GUESS WHO WENT TO THE GIANT
SALE AT THE PARTY STORE.

28:50.100 --> 28:51.852
THIS GUY.

28:51.900 --> 28:54.755
I GOT SO MUCH STUFF, YOU COULD
HAVE ALL OF YOUR KIDS' PARTIES

28:54.800 --> 28:56.415
FOR THE NEXT, LIKE, 50 YEARS.

28:56.450 --> 28:58.179
THEY'RE HAVING A--HEY.
OH, WELL, ALL RIGHT.

28:58.210 --> 28:59.381
HERE, YOU PASS THESE OUT.

28:59.420 --> 29:01.479
THEY WERE HAVING A SALE
ON HATS AND HORNS.

29:01.530 --> 29:02.906
I GOT LEIS.

29:02.940 --> 29:04.248
WE COULD HAVE, LIKE, A HAWAIIAN
THEME PARTY.

29:04.290 --> 29:05.564
TAKE A--ANYONE?

29:05.600 --> 29:07.397
GUYS, THEY GOT FESTIVE COLORS.

29:07.430 --> 29:10.467
OH, HERE, DAD.
I GUESS YOU'RE THE BIRTHDAY BOY.

29:10.500 --> 29:14.812
AND SO...WHAT IS GOING ON?

29:14.850 --> 29:17.193
[jazz music playing]

29:17.230 --> 29:19.983
SO IT TRACKS HOW MANY STEPS
YOU'VE TAKEN.

29:20.030 --> 29:21.338
YOU CAN PRESS A LITTLE BUTTON,
AND IT'LL TELL YOU

29:21.380 --> 29:24.827
HOW MANY STEPS YOU'VE TAKEN
AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

29:24.860 --> 29:26.919
- THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING.
- NO, ADAM, I NEED TO ANSWER IT.

29:26.970 --> 29:28.232
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
STAY STRONG FOR ME.

29:28.280 --> 29:30.271
IT'S EDGAR'S MOM.
I AM STAYING STRONG, OKAY?

29:30.320 --> 29:31.309
EDGAR'S A KID
THAT WE USE AS SLAVE LABOR.

29:31.350 --> 29:33.033
ADAM DID, ACTUALLY.
HEY, EMILY.

29:33.080 --> 29:35.389
- SHE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW THIS.
- IT'S LIKE A HEALTH GAME.

29:35.420 --> 29:36.455
- IT'S FUN.
- I DON'T KNOW.

29:36.490 --> 29:38.799
I WANT ONE, RIGHT?
THEY'RE FUN.

29:38.840 --> 29:40.148
OKAY.
WELL, YOU CAN USE THIS ONE.

29:40.190 --> 29:42.044
OF COURSE.

29:42.090 --> 29:44.399
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON THE GRANDKIDS.

29:44.430 --> 29:46.113
I DIDN'T LISTEN
TO YOUR MESSAGE YET.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.128
THERE YOU GO. I'M NOT GONNA
EVEN MEASURE MY STEPS.

29:48.160 --> 29:49.957
I'M JUST GONNA COUNT 'EM
TO MYSELF.

29:49.990 --> 29:51.298
MY FATHER-IN-LAW'S
BIRTH DAY PARTY,

29:51.340 --> 29:53.570
AND HE'S ACTUALLY NOT
IN THE BEST OF HEALTH RIGHT NOW.

29:53.610 --> 29:54.611
HE'S SO STUBBORN.

29:54.650 --> 29:56.572
- I'M SORRY, WHAT?
- NOTHING.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.064
HE'S SO STUBBORN.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.136
MOM, YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HIM.

30:00.170 --> 30:03.037
WELL, WE'RE TALKING.

30:03.070 --> 30:04.549
BUT THIS IS HIS BIRTHDAY.

30:04.590 --> 30:07.150
I JUST WANT HIM
TO HAVE A NICE PARTY.

30:07.180 --> 30:10.149
OKAY.
WELL, I GUESS WHAT WE REALLY

30:10.180 --> 30:12.114
NEED IS BIRTHDAY CAKE.

30:12.150 --> 30:14.357
WE NEED BIRTHDAY CAKE.

30:14.390 --> 30:15.948
- YES.
- OKAY.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.561
I'LL HELP YOU
WITH THE CANDLES.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.636
THANK YOU.
MAX?

30:19.670 --> 30:21.979
HEY,
CAN YOU HOLD HER?

30:22.020 --> 30:23.954
OH, UH, YES.
OKAY, SURE.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.127
YOU GOT HER?
YOU GOT HER?

30:25.160 --> 30:26.843
- HI. I DO.
- GOOD, GOOD.

30:30.650 --> 30:34.029
- FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.
- DAD.

30:34.070 --> 30:36.584
OH, GOD,
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME--

30:36.620 --> 30:39.032
7 DAD? _
- [groaning, muttering]

30:39.070 --> 30:40.583
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME, DAD.

30:40.630 --> 30:41.892
GEEZ.

30:41.940 --> 30:44.522
HUH?
OH, YOU GOT TO SPEAK UP, SON.

30:44.560 --> 30:49.520
YOU KNOW I GOT BAD EARS.
I'M JUST A FRAIL OLD MAN.

30:49.570 --> 30:51.253
[gaSPSJ

30:51.290 --> 30:52.564
WILL YOU COME ON?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:52.600 --> 30:55.467
WELL, I WAS LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING WITH MEAT IN IT,

30:55.500 --> 30:58.572
BECAUSE IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T
NOTICED, AT MY BIRTHDAY PARTY,

30:58.610 --> 31:01.886
EVERYTHING IS MOSTLY MADE
WITH LENTILS OR TOFU.

31:01.920 --> 31:04.161
YEAH, I KNOW.
EVERYBODY'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.919
REALLY? WELL,
I'M KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT ME.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.962
ARE YOU?
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.444
IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE YOU'RE DEALING WITH THIS.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.061
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU'RE
TAKING IT SERIOUSLY AT ALL.

31:12.110 --> 31:16.695
OH, NO, SON,
I AM TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY.

31:16.730 --> 31:18.413
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD DO IT.
YOU SHOULD HAVE THE SURGERY.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.484
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

31:21.150 --> 31:23.380
DO YOU KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN?
I COULD DIE ON THAT TABLE.

31:23.430 --> 31:25.079
I KNOW.

31:25.120 --> 31:27.327
AND I ALSO KNOW
IT'S A 95% SUCCESS RATE

31:27.360 --> 31:29.089
FOR THIS SURGERY, 95%.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.394
THOSE ARE REALLY GOOD ODDS.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.226
- ARE THEY?
- YEAH.

31:32.260 --> 31:33.909
GEEZ, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.530
COME ON.
I AM WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK.

31:35.580 --> 31:36.717
I DON'T LIKE THE ALTERNATIVE.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.229
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT MY DOCTOR TOLD ME?

31:38.270 --> 31:39.373
MY DOCTOR SAYS THAT,

31:39.410 --> 31:41.401
YOU KNOW, IF THE SURGERY
DOESN'T GO WELL,

31:41.450 --> 31:44.135
I THINK HE PUT IT
VERY POETICALLY WHEN HE SAID,

31:44.170 --> 31:47.515
"YOU'D HAVE A DIMINISHED
QUALITY OF LIFE."

31:47.560 --> 31:49.937
IT'S STILL A LIFE.

31:49.970 --> 31:51.653
NOT ONE I WANT.

31:51.700 --> 31:56.421
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE SURGERY,
YOU COULD DIE.

31:56.460 --> 31:59.941
YOU COULD DIE, DAD.
WHAT DO I DO THEN?

31:59.980 --> 32:03.325
IF I DIE,
YOU JUST TAKE MY ASHES,

32:03.360 --> 32:05.703
YOU SCATTER THEM IN CENTER FIELD
AT MARINE PARK,

32:05.750 --> 32:10.153
AND YOU PLAY A GAME
OF BASEBALL OVER ME...

32:10.200 --> 32:13.260
'CAUSE I'M GOING OUT
ON MY TERMS.

32:13.310 --> 32:16.689
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

32:16.720 --> 32:20.759
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

32:20.800 --> 32:25.385
HAPPY BIRTH DAY,
DEAR DAD

32:25.420 --> 32:29.550
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

32:43.090 --> 32:45.786
- HEY.
- HI.

32:45.820 --> 32:48.197
HEY.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.686
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:50.720 --> 32:52.654
I'M GETTING AWAY
FROM THE STUPID FRUIT TART,

32:52.690 --> 32:54.032
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

32:54.070 --> 32:56.209
ME TOO.
[sniffles]

32:56.250 --> 32:59.344
CAN I SIT DOWN?
YOU SURE?

33:02.250 --> 33:05.185
OH, BOY.

33:05.220 --> 33:07.074
OH, DEAR.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.519
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT MY HEART CONDITION,

33:08.570 --> 33:09.776
IS IT?

33:13.540 --> 33:15.053
I'M PREGNANT.

33:19.230 --> 33:20.606
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED IN ME?

33:20.650 --> 33:24.336
OH, BABY, NO.

33:24.380 --> 33:28.089
AMBER...
[laughs]
