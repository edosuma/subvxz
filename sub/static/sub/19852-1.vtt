00:18.249 --> 00:19.349
Ho, there!.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.200
Stop, thieves!.

00:43.828 --> 00:48.579
There is still time to reconsider, my dear
Miss Taylor. Come back home with us.

00:48.779 --> 00:50.480
James will not mind turning the carriage round.

00:50.590 --> 00:52.481
Nobody you know will take it amiss.

00:52.591 --> 00:54.421
Papa, Mr. Weston would take it very much amiss.

00:54.521 --> 00:58.383
Mr. Woodhouse, you are very kind.
I shall miss Hartfield.

00:58.543 --> 01:03.154
But I am very happy to become Mr. Weston's wife.
Truly I am.

01:04.045 --> 01:06.546
But it's all very disturbing, Emma!.

01:06.690 --> 01:08.876
Six good hens, and now Miss Taylor.

01:08.959 --> 01:10.257
It's a sad business.

01:10.328 --> 01:13.178
- Ah, good morning!
- Good morning!

01:18.104 --> 01:20.039
Repeat after me.

01:20.107 --> 01:22.481
I, William Francis Weston...

01:22.611 --> 01:24.442
I, William Francis Weston...

01:24.732 --> 01:28.583
take thee, Anna Taylor...

01:46.476 --> 01:48.741
Poor Miss Taylor.

01:48.813 --> 01:51.078
Oh, Father!.

01:53.453 --> 01:57.123
What a pity it is that Mr. Weston
ever thought of her.

01:57.191 --> 02:00.687
But Father, you wouldn't have Miss Taylor
live with us forever

02:00.762 --> 02:02.958
when she could have a house of her own.

02:03.032 --> 02:06.799
It's been a long time
since I needed a governess.

02:06.870 --> 02:08.930
She will never see us now.

02:09.007 --> 02:11.272
Randalls is such a distance.

02:11.343 --> 02:13.938
It's barely half a mile, Father.

02:14.014 --> 02:17.542
Depend upon it, we shall see
Mrs. Weston nearly every day.

02:17.618 --> 02:21.419
Well, I take it very ill when
people get married and go away.

02:21.490 --> 02:23.391
I think they should not do it.

02:24.994 --> 02:26.895
Will you play at backgammon, Father?.

02:27.044 --> 02:28.304
Well...

02:28.374 --> 02:29.424
Oh!.

02:29.501 --> 02:34.135
Why will people call at such a late hour?

02:34.206 --> 02:36.073
There you are.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.435
How are you, Thomas?. And your family?.

02:38.514 --> 02:40.948
Very well, Mr. Knightley. Thank you, sir.

02:42.017 --> 02:45.747
Well, how did it go?
I'm sorry to have missed it.

02:45.822 --> 02:47.830
How did you all behave?. Hmm?.

02:47.926 --> 02:48.859
Who cried most?

02:49.928 --> 02:51.589
Ah, poor Miss Taylor!.

02:51.663 --> 02:54.460
Poor Mr. Woodhouse... Poor Miss Woodhouse,
if you like

02:54.534 --> 02:56.799
but I can't say "poor Miss Taylor".

02:56.870 --> 02:59.066
At least she has only one
to please now, not two.

02:59.140 --> 03:02.845
Especially when one of them is a fanciful and
troublesome creature?.

03:02.969 --> 03:03.956
Perhaps.

03:04.046 --> 03:07.409
That's very true. I am fanciful and troublesome.

03:07.485 --> 03:13.039
Oh, dearest Papa! I didn't mean you.
I meant only myself.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.810
Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me,
you know.

03:15.887 --> 03:16.130
Oh, dear!

03:16.440 --> 03:17.230
In a joke, it's all a joke.

03:17.495 --> 03:18.715
Oh, yes, of course!.

03:18.788 --> 03:22.242
We always say what we like to one another.

03:22.726 --> 03:24.592
You want to hear about the wedding?.

03:24.663 --> 03:29.024
We all behaved charmingly. Everybody punctual,
in their best looks.

03:29.154 --> 03:31.465
Not a tear and hardly
a long face to be seen.

03:31.575 --> 03:34.256
Emma bears everything so well.

03:34.586 --> 03:36.957
But every friend of Miss Taylor's
must be glad to see her married.

03:37.027 --> 03:39.468
You've forgotten one matter of joy to me:

03:39.558 --> 03:40.850
that I made the match myself.

03:41.068 --> 03:43.779
You made a lucky guess, Emma.

03:43.919 --> 03:46.020
I wish you would not make matches, my dear,

03:46.680 --> 03:48.611
for whatever you say always comes to pass.

03:48.927 --> 03:51.742
Pray, do not make any more of them, Emma.

03:52.145 --> 03:53.793
Oh!, I promise to make none for myself, Papa,

03:53.841 --> 03:55.633
but I must, indeed, for other people.

03:56.851 --> 04:00.155
Poor Mr. Elton, now... I must look
about for a wife for him.

04:00.222 --> 04:02.566
You'd do better to leave
the poor man alone, Emma.

04:02.646 --> 04:05.509
But he has been here a year, and has fitted
out the vicarage so comfortably,

04:05.584 --> 04:08.778
it would be a shame
to have him single any longer.

04:08.988 --> 04:14.690
"And for his sheep He doth us take..."

04:16.699 --> 04:23.937
"All people that on Earth do dwell",

04:24.008 --> 04:32.216
"Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice".

04:33.056 --> 04:40.389
"Him serve with fear, His praise forthtell".

04:40.459 --> 04:49.271
"Come ye before him and rejoice".

04:53.181 --> 04:54.479
Harriet Smith?

04:54.550 --> 04:57.952
She is somebody's natural
daughter, you know.

04:59.101 --> 05:01.332
She seems a very sweet, genteel girl.

05:01.404 --> 05:03.373
Indeed she is.

05:03.441 --> 05:06.704
She is just now returned to the school
as parlor-boarder.

05:06.778 --> 05:10.729
She spent the summer at her friend's
house in the country.

05:17.726 --> 05:22.892
It would be good for her to have the
benefit of more... varied society.

05:22.966 --> 05:25.734
Would you like to send her on Tuesday
to my father's whist party?.

05:26.158 --> 05:28.865
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, that is very kind!.

05:28.955 --> 05:30.824
I should be glad to know her better.

05:34.036 --> 05:37.770
Mrs. Bates, let me propose you
venturing on one of these eggs.

05:37.841 --> 05:41.210
An egg boiled very soft,
you know, is not unwholesome.

05:41.279 --> 05:45.011
Mr. Perry, in fact, is not
altogether against eggs.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.611
Against eggs?. No, indeed.

05:47.266 --> 05:49.666
A soft-boiled egg will do you no harm.

05:49.735 --> 05:53.364
There you are, Mrs. Bates.
Mr. Perry says it is all right.

05:53.441 --> 05:56.900
Indeed, she dearly loves
a fresh egg softly boiled.

05:56.979 --> 05:58.971
I think she does not hear, Miss Bates.

05:59.049 --> 06:03.149
Mr. Knightley was so good as to let
us have three dozen of his fresh-laid eggs...

06:03.217 --> 06:05.788
Serle understands boiling an egg
better than anybody.

06:06.088 --> 06:08.659
And when his man, William Larkins,
brought them around, he said

06:08.729 --> 06:10.219
Mr. Knightley is left without an egg.

06:10.610 --> 06:13.000
I would not recommend an egg
boiled by anybody else.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.622
Imagine, no eggs at Donwell Abbey!,

06:14.691 --> 06:16.556
but then he is so very generous.

06:17.012 --> 06:21.270
You need not be afraid.
These are very small, you see.

06:21.345 --> 06:24.315
One of our small eggs will not hurt you.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.216
I think she does not hear, Miss Bates.

06:27.286 --> 06:28.786
Allow me to help you, Mrs. Bates.

06:29.489 --> 06:32.220
Oh!, thank you so much,
Mr. Elton.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.152
And they have eight cows,

06:34.229 --> 06:37.462
two of them Alderneys and one a little Welch cow,

06:37.533 --> 06:39.194
a very pretty little Welch cow.

06:39.268 --> 06:43.040
And Mrs. Martin said as I was so fond of it
it should be called "my" cow.

06:43.108 --> 06:45.303
Do you know the Martins, Miss Woodhouse?.

06:45.377 --> 06:49.445
Mr. Martin knows you by sight very well.
His farm is very near to Donwell.

06:49.516 --> 06:52.077
Then they must be Mr. Knightley's tenants.

06:52.153 --> 06:56.518
I may have seen Mr. Martin 50 times,
without having any idea of his name.

06:56.592 --> 07:00.854
A young farmer is not at all the sort
of person to raise my curiosity.

07:00.931 --> 07:02.455
No, no, I suppose not.

07:02.533 --> 07:06.130
But they have two parlors,
two very good parlors.

07:06.205 --> 07:07.331
Indeed!.

07:07.407 --> 07:10.480
Well, Harriet, I'm sure these Martins
must feel very proud

07:10.550 --> 07:12.681
to entertain a gentleman's daughter.

07:12.751 --> 07:16.815
I do not know that my father
"is" a gentleman, Miss Woodhouse.

07:16.886 --> 07:18.445
Oh!, I am quite sure he is.

07:18.522 --> 07:22.949
But even so, and particularly bearing in mind
the misfortune of your birth,

07:23.027 --> 07:26.599
you should be very careful
whom you choose as your friends.

07:26.666 --> 07:28.306
Oh, do you think so?.

07:29.186 --> 07:30.337
I'm quite sure of it.

07:31.327 --> 07:35.659
Miss Smith, what do you say
to a little bit of apple tart?.

07:35.845 --> 07:37.176
A very little bit?.

07:37.246 --> 07:39.780
Let Emma help you to a very little
bit of apple tart.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.781
No, no, no, allow me!.

07:47.894 --> 07:49.259
Thank you, Mr. Elton.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.670
How can I ever thank you
enough, Miss Woodhouse,

08:09.750 --> 08:12.151
for showing me where
true joy was to be found?.

08:12.621 --> 08:16.032
Mrs. Elton and I are
eternally indebted to you.

08:16.433 --> 08:21.198
And to think that I should turn out
to be the daughter of a baronet!.

08:24.335 --> 08:26.926
Why not?. Stranger things have happened.

08:28.983 --> 08:34.047
I do so wonder that you should not
be married so charming as you are.

08:34.123 --> 08:37.253
I must find other people charming.
One person at least.

08:37.327 --> 08:39.671
I have very little intention
of ever marrying at all.

08:39.751 --> 08:40.861
Dear me!.

08:40.971 --> 08:44.958
Why should I?. I lack neither fortune
nor consequence.

08:45.037 --> 08:48.404
If I were to fall in love...
but then I have never been in love.

08:48.843 --> 08:50.674
It is not my way, or my nature.

08:50.745 --> 08:52.907
But then to be an old maid
like Miss Bates!.

08:52.981 --> 08:56.579
If I thought that I should be like
Miss Bates, I would marry tomorrow.

08:58.427 --> 09:01.151
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, there is Mr. Martin.

09:01.226 --> 09:02.386
Oh, really?.

09:03.930 --> 09:06.890
I never thought to meet you
walking here, Miss Smith.

09:07.800 --> 09:12.912
Oh, dear! Perhaps I should... excuse me.

09:13.042 --> 09:15.191
No, no, please!. I shall wait for you, Harriet.

09:47.288 --> 09:50.520
Only think of our happening to meet him!.

09:50.592 --> 09:54.927
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, please say
what you think of him.

09:54.998 --> 09:57.160
Do you think him so very plain?.

09:57.234 --> 09:59.203
He is very plain, undoubtedly.

09:59.271 --> 10:03.541
But that is nothing compared with
his entire lack of gentility.

10:03.609 --> 10:07.377
I did not expect much, but I had no idea he
could be so clownish,

10:07.448 --> 10:09.382
so totally without air.

10:09.450 --> 10:13.088
To be sure. He is not so genteel
as real gentlemen.

10:13.156 --> 10:14.350
Indeed, no.

10:14.424 --> 10:19.188
Consider Mr. Knightley. Consider Mr. Elton.

10:19.264 --> 10:22.098
Certainly he is not like Mr. Knightley.

10:22.168 --> 10:25.104
But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!.

10:25.172 --> 10:28.769
And Mr. Elton, who has paid
you such particular attentions.

10:28.843 --> 10:31.335
You must see the difference.

10:31.414 --> 10:35.408
Yes, I suppose there
is a great difference.

10:35.485 --> 10:38.483
And I think Mr. Elton is
becoming very fond of you.

10:39.625 --> 10:42.152
Harriet, have you ever had
your likeness taken?.

10:42.228 --> 10:44.162
My likeness?.

10:44.230 --> 10:47.634
Don't you think she makes a charming picture?.

10:47.702 --> 10:49.432
Oh, yes, indeed.

10:49.504 --> 10:52.426
You have given Miss Smith
all that she required.

10:52.706 --> 10:57.948
She was beautiful when she came to you,
but you have made her... graceful... and easy.

10:58.018 --> 11:00.508
Oh, no, no, she only wanted drawing out.

11:00.586 --> 11:03.886
Oh, I shall never do justice to her!.

11:03.957 --> 11:06.017
Do you see, Mr. Elton?.

11:06.094 --> 11:09.531
Her features are so delicate, and yet

11:09.598 --> 11:12.243
there's a peculiarity in the shape
of the eyes and the line about the mouth.

11:12.373 --> 11:15.907
Exactly!, and that's just
what you've caught.

11:15.974 --> 11:17.985
There she is, to the very life.

11:18.555 --> 11:20.956
Mr. Elton, I've scarcely begun!.

11:21.626 --> 11:24.467
Oh!, but these are excellent.

11:24.537 --> 11:27.086
No, nothing like. You
will see when they come.

11:27.155 --> 11:30.888
My sister Isabella and her children.
They would never keep still.

11:30.960 --> 11:34.056
Her husband, Mr. John Knightley...
he is not so bad,

11:34.131 --> 11:36.430
but Isabella said
it didn't do him justice.

11:36.501 --> 11:38.732
So I resolved to give up
portraits forever,

11:38.804 --> 11:41.753
at least where there are husbands
and wives in the case.

11:41.823 --> 11:44.824
Ah, yes!. But there are no husbands
and wives in this case.

11:44.924 --> 11:49.255
Or should I say, not at present?.

11:51.320 --> 11:54.690
Perfection!. Absolute perfection!.

11:54.758 --> 11:57.887
Miss Smith has not
those eyebrows, I think.

11:57.962 --> 12:00.488
Oh, no!, I cannot agree with you.

12:00.566 --> 12:01.898
You've made her too tall.

12:01.968 --> 12:04.870
Oh, no!, certainly not too tall.

12:04.941 --> 12:09.492
Well, consider she's sitting down, and the
proportions, you know, must be preserved.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.277
It's very pretty, but my dear,

12:12.348 --> 12:16.644
she seems to be sitting out of doors
with only a little shawl.

12:16.721 --> 12:20.796
It makes one think she must catch cold.

12:20.896 --> 12:22.107
But Papa, it's supposed to be summer

12:22.187 --> 12:24.788
A warm day in summer... look at the tree.

12:25.028 --> 12:28.066
I regard it as a most happy thought

12:28.137 --> 12:31.700
the placing of Miss Smith
out of doors...

12:31.808 --> 12:35.111
And the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit.

12:35.181 --> 12:40.133
Miss Woodhouse, might I appeal for the
commissión of getting the picture framed?.

12:40.483 --> 12:44.481
If you would trust me with it I could
ride to London at any time.

12:44.558 --> 12:51.324
No, no!. I will be bold and insist that
you entrust it to no one but me.

13:02.330 --> 13:03.691
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, you will never guess!.

13:04.381 --> 13:05.672
He has proposed.

13:05.802 --> 13:08.963
Already?. But, are you quite sure?.

13:09.093 --> 13:11.804
Yes!, he says so quite clearly
in this letter.

13:12.434 --> 13:15.385
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, what am I to do?.

13:15.767 --> 13:18.446
But this letter is from
Mr. Robert Martin.

13:18.676 --> 13:21.627
Yes!, didn't I say that?.

13:21.727 --> 13:26.299
Do you think it is a good letter?.
Is it too short?.

13:26.469 --> 13:30.460
No, it is a good letter. A very good letter.

13:30.530 --> 13:32.591
Much better than I should have expected.

13:32.681 --> 13:35.552
So... how should I reply?.

13:35.662 --> 13:37.596
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, please advise me.

13:37.664 --> 13:40.360
Oh, no!, the letter had much
better be all your own.

13:40.433 --> 13:42.561
But your meaning must be quite clear,

13:42.636 --> 13:46.967
no doubts or demurs. Modest sorrow at
his disappointment.

13:47.043 --> 13:51.310
You... you think I ought
to refuse him, then?.

13:51.381 --> 13:54.048
Harriet, are you in any doubt?.

13:55.809 --> 13:58.930
I had no notion that
he liked me so very much.

14:00.050 --> 14:03.224
I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet,

14:03.297 --> 14:06.431
that if a woman doubts, she certainly
ought to refuse him.

14:06.501 --> 14:08.633
But do not imagine I want to influence you.

14:08.743 --> 14:10.634
Oh, no!, I'm sure.

14:10.734 --> 14:14.171
But if you would just advise me
what I had best...

14:14.246 --> 14:15.714
I don't mean that.

14:15.781 --> 14:19.741
As you say, one's mind
ought to be quite made up.

14:19.820 --> 14:21.721
Do you think I had better say no?.

14:21.789 --> 14:25.055
Harriet, you must be the best
judge of your own happiness.

14:25.129 --> 14:30.070
Do you truly prefer Mr. Martin to
every other man you've ever met?.

14:30.631 --> 14:34.572
Harriet... Harriet, do not
deceive yourself.

14:34.640 --> 14:39.170
Do not be run away with
by gratitude and compassión.

14:41.624 --> 14:45.456
Miss Woodhouse, as you won't
give me your opinion...

14:46.322 --> 14:49.167
I think... yes.

14:49.359 --> 14:54.879
I have now quite determined and have almost
made up my mind... To refuse Mr. Martin.

14:55.689 --> 14:57.170
Do you think I am right?.

14:57.490 --> 14:59.897
Perfectly, perfectly right,

14:59.974 --> 15:03.837
dearest Harriet... And now I can tell you
what I could not before

15:03.912 --> 15:05.540
because I would not
influence you...

15:05.615 --> 15:08.814
If had you accepted him I would have lost my friend.

15:09.854 --> 15:12.885
I could not visit Mrs. Robert Martin
of Abbey Mill farm.

15:12.957 --> 15:16.291
Now I am secure of you forever.

15:23.972 --> 15:25.998
She refused him?.

15:26.076 --> 15:27.941
Yes!.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.105
Harriet Smith refused Robert Martin?.

15:30.181 --> 15:31.649
Yes!.

15:31.717 --> 15:33.912
Then she's a greater simpleton
than I thought.

15:34.002 --> 15:35.213
What is the foolish girl about?.

15:35.303 --> 15:39.349
A man imagines a woman ready
for anyone who asks her!.

15:39.426 --> 15:42.693
Nonsense!. A man imagines no such thing.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.428
I hope you're mistaken.

15:45.501 --> 15:48.461
I saw her answer. Nothing could be clearer.

15:48.538 --> 15:49.870
You saw her answer?.

15:51.209 --> 15:53.075
You wrote her answer!.

15:53.145 --> 15:56.705
Emma, this is your doing.
You persuaded her to refuse him.

15:56.783 --> 15:59.514
If I did, I should not feel
that I had done wrong.

15:59.587 --> 16:04.163
Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,
I am sure, but he is not Harriet's equal.

16:04.263 --> 16:07.855
No, he's not!. He's her superior
in both sense and situation!.

16:07.931 --> 16:12.096
Harriet Smith is the natural
daughter of nobody knows whom.

16:12.170 --> 16:15.671
A girl with no connections.
A parlor-boarder at a common school.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.403
She's been taught nothing useful.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.072
She is pretty, good-tempered,
and that is all!.

16:20.128 --> 16:23.962
My only scruple in recommending
the match to Robert Martin...

16:24.052 --> 16:25.645
You recommended it?.

16:25.702 --> 16:28.162
Yes, and my only scruple was on his account.

16:28.259 --> 16:32.623
I felt he could do much better both as
to fortune and securing a useful helpmate.

16:32.697 --> 16:36.114
But I could not reason so
to a man so much in love!.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.930
And depend upon it he had encouragement from her.

16:39.007 --> 16:41.907
She may have been inclined towards him
at one time,

16:41.977 --> 16:43.706
but the case is altered now.

16:43.779 --> 16:47.247
She knows what a gentleman is and only
a gentleman has any chance with Harriet.

16:47.347 --> 16:51.289
Oh, that is nonsense!. That is arrant nonsense!.

16:51.669 --> 16:54.630
You're not thinking of Elton... are you?.

16:54.740 --> 16:57.741
If you are, depend upon it,
Elton won't do.

16:58.381 --> 17:00.672
He may talk sentimentally,
but he will act rationally.

17:00.752 --> 17:03.313
He knows the value of a good income.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.473
Harriet Smith has no chance there!.

17:05.541 --> 17:08.167
I have no intention of marrying
Harriet to anybody!

17:11.185 --> 17:14.214
You have done your friend
no favors, Emma.

17:14.307 --> 17:18.781
You have spoilt her best chance of happiness.

17:18.859 --> 17:23.221
It was badly done. And I am sorry for it.

17:28.728 --> 17:29.922
Good day to you!.

17:36.334 --> 17:37.750
You are wrong, Mr. Knightley.

17:37.819 --> 17:39.865
And you will see you are wrong,
and then you will be sorry.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.111
I beg you would not
toss them high, John!.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.672
Nonsense!, higher the better. Now, come.

17:58.772 --> 18:00.874
Run for your uncle as fast as you can.

18:00.950 --> 18:02.193
Fee, fi, fo, fum!.

18:06.499 --> 18:08.195
Oh John, Papa is distressed.!.

18:08.285 --> 18:09.776
Well, well, that'll do, no more.

18:10.496 --> 18:12.056
Take them away, Betty. Off with them, Jane.

18:12.196 --> 18:13.457
No, Papa!.

18:13.527 --> 18:16.128
No, no, no, no, no!. No more!.

18:16.237 --> 18:18.539
Say good night to your grandpapa, sir.

18:19.349 --> 18:22.574
- My little Emma stays.
- Aye, she makes no noise.

18:24.546 --> 18:26.913
You look well thus, Emma.

18:27.272 --> 18:27.862
Good night...

18:29.082 --> 18:29.562
Good night.

18:29.993 --> 18:34.274
Now then, sir, shall we
take you on a little horse?.

18:35.885 --> 18:39.236
Yes!, we will, sir. Yes, we will!.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.510
Night-night, sir.

18:51.936 --> 18:54.341
I remember holding you thus,
once upon a time.

18:54.654 --> 18:56.213
You and I must not be enemies.

18:56.800 --> 19:00.433
No!... you may do wrong, and I may be angry with you,

19:00.503 --> 19:02.474
but you and I shall never be enemies.

19:03.434 --> 19:06.316
You forget that I have
not been proved wrong.

19:06.405 --> 19:10.258
But I do hope that Mr. Martin
is not very disappointed.

19:10.327 --> 19:12.853
A man could not be more so.

19:12.931 --> 19:15.924
Then, indeed, I am very sorry.

19:16.971 --> 19:19.840
No, Isabella. There is no avoiding it.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.120
Mr. And Mrs. Weston have invited me,
and we must go,

19:23.061 --> 19:25.609
Christmas Eve or not, whatever the weather.

19:26.183 --> 19:28.685
She is a bride and the visit must be paid.

19:28.753 --> 19:32.087
I do believe, whatever the consequences.

19:36.996 --> 19:41.260
Aye!, Mr. Weston must have a very
good opinion of himself,

19:41.337 --> 19:44.498
asking people to leave their own fireside,
in the depths of winter,

19:44.568 --> 19:45.708
just for the sake
of coming to see him.

19:46.457 --> 19:49.018
He must think himself
a most agreeable fellow.

19:54.972 --> 19:55.972
Oh!.

19:56.272 --> 19:59.473
Go slowly, James. Go carefully.

19:59.674 --> 20:01.264
Hey, go on!.

20:01.424 --> 20:06.309
Here we are, setting forward to spend five
dull hours in another man's house,

20:06.384 --> 20:09.244
going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse.

20:09.321 --> 20:12.890
Actually snowing at this moment,
and more to come.

20:12.959 --> 20:15.755
Four horses and four servants
taken out for nothing

20:15.830 --> 20:18.163
but to convey four idle,
shivering creatures,

20:18.233 --> 20:21.541
into colder rooms and worse company
than they might have had at home.

20:21.841 --> 20:25.442
But you must know we are sure of excellent fires,
and everything in the greatest comfort.

20:26.022 --> 20:29.583
Here's the parson. He looks keen enough.

20:33.787 --> 20:37.388
My dear sir. Words cannot express my gratitude.

20:37.458 --> 20:39.893
On such a night as this,
a Christmas party.

20:39.962 --> 20:41.590
Nothing could be pleasanter.

20:41.664 --> 20:45.969
Miss Woodhouse, this is an honor. Nay...
a delight.

20:46.060 --> 20:50.261
Well, get yourself in man, and get the door shut.
And the less said the better.

21:02.905 --> 21:04.005
Ah!.

21:05.636 --> 21:07.311
A very happy gathering indeed.

21:07.398 --> 21:09.967
We want only two more to be just the right number:

21:10.037 --> 21:13.099
Your pretty little friend Miss Smith...
a bad sore throat.

21:13.173 --> 21:14.402
Oh, dear!.

21:14.469 --> 21:15.419
Has Perry been called?.

21:15.499 --> 21:17.450
Yes, and recommends she stay in bed.

21:17.540 --> 21:20.176
A sad loss for us.

21:20.249 --> 21:21.541
Indeed.

21:21.631 --> 21:23.886
And... my son, Frank.

21:23.944 --> 21:27.137
I thought Frank would be here for Christmas, but...

21:27.215 --> 21:29.334
it was not to be.

21:30.044 --> 21:31.977
So, to absent friends!.

21:35.059 --> 21:36.492
Absent friends!.

21:40.195 --> 21:43.469
I'm beginning to fear I shall never meet
the famous Mr. Frank Churchill.

21:43.569 --> 21:47.670
No, no, you are wrong... for he has promised
to be with us in two weeks' time.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.981
Frank is the son of my first marriage, Mr. Elton.

21:51.802 --> 21:53.672
His poor mother died when he was but two years old.

21:54.332 --> 21:56.233
Her family undertook
his care and education.

21:56.613 --> 21:58.014
and in gratitude, he took their name.

21:58.474 --> 22:00.295
A deal of money in it, I daresay.

22:00.785 --> 22:02.723
What age is the young man now?.

22:02.792 --> 22:05.957
He is three and 20 and though I say it myself,

22:06.029 --> 22:07.767
as fine a young man
as anyone could wish to see.

22:08.707 --> 22:12.639
My only complaint is that Mrs. Churchill
keeps him at her beck and call in Yorkshire,

22:12.719 --> 22:14.439
so he is unable to be here.

22:14.549 --> 22:16.714
Indeed, I have never yet
set eyes on him.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.831
He should have come before this.

22:19.682 --> 22:23.910
To speak bluntly, ma'am,
it is his duty to his father and to you.

22:23.988 --> 22:27.644
Well, I forgive him. It is a delicate business.

22:28.454 --> 22:33.263
Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and she
is a very odd-tempered woman.

22:33.336 --> 22:36.827
And his coming now depends on
her being willing to spare him.

22:36.938 --> 22:39.169
That is the young man
in question,

22:39.248 --> 22:40.572
Frank to the very life.

22:40.643 --> 22:43.639
And he is very handsome, is he not, Mr. Elton?.

22:43.899 --> 22:47.211
I hardly know. Appearances may often deceive.

22:51.092 --> 22:53.350
As is well known,
I intend never to marry.

22:53.428 --> 22:55.658
But I confess, if I were
to change my mind,

22:55.733 --> 22:58.695
I have always thought Mr. Frank Churchill
might be the man;

22:58.768 --> 23:01.796
for by all accounts, he seems to be
the epitome of manly excellence.

23:02.526 --> 23:06.117
Apart from his disinclination to exert
himself, and do what he knows to be right?.

23:07.638 --> 23:09.878
Mr. Knightley, isn't it very unfair
to judge a person's conduct,

23:09.949 --> 23:12.199
when we do not know his situation?.

23:12.269 --> 23:14.633
He may be unable to do
what he truly wishes.

23:14.703 --> 23:18.851
There is one thing a man can always
do if he chooses, and that is his duty.

23:20.372 --> 23:22.508
If he truly willed it,
he could be here tomorrow.

23:22.583 --> 23:25.106
You seem determined to think ill of him.

23:25.184 --> 23:27.618
I?. Not at all!.

23:27.686 --> 23:31.096
He is a person I never think of
from one month's end to another.

23:40.039 --> 23:42.509
How well she looks tonight!.

23:42.660 --> 23:45.139
Oh!, as to her beauty, she always looks well,

23:45.210 --> 23:46.906
but as to her character, I...

23:46.981 --> 23:48.722
Come, Mr. Knightley.

23:48.815 --> 23:52.384
With all her faults, you know she is
an excellent creature.

23:52.453 --> 23:56.454
Perhaps she is, but she thinks she has
nothing to learn.

23:58.055 --> 24:01.026
I should like to see her in love
and in some doubt of a return.

24:01.098 --> 24:03.033
Would you?. Really?.

24:03.101 --> 24:04.617
It would do her good.

24:05.657 --> 24:09.739
Well, the snow is lying
three inches deep!.

24:09.810 --> 24:15.651
A spirited beginning for your
winter engagements, Mr. Woodhouse.

24:15.731 --> 24:18.652
Oh... oh, Isabella. Emma... Emma?.

24:18.722 --> 24:20.292
What can we do?.

24:20.402 --> 24:22.143
I'm sure it's not so very bad, Papa.

24:22.233 --> 24:25.884
I admired your determination in
setting out sir. And I daresay

24:25.964 --> 24:27.175
we shall get home alive.

24:27.285 --> 24:31.376
We are two carriages. If one is blown over
there will be the other at hand.

24:47.661 --> 24:52.765
Mrs. Weston... How can I thank you for
such a splendid evening?.

25:03.248 --> 25:06.344
Miss Woodhouse... We meet at last!.

25:10.525 --> 25:12.117
Emma!.

25:27.380 --> 25:31.518
John Knightley went in the first carriage
with Mrs. Knightley and your father.

25:31.587 --> 25:34.647
I am to have the pleasure
of escorting you.

25:34.724 --> 25:36.157
Oh!, thank you.

25:48.376 --> 25:50.571
Pity our party had to... Mr. Elton!.

25:50.645 --> 25:51.772
Forgive me, I must...

25:51.847 --> 25:55.310
I must avail myself of this God-given opportunity,

25:55.385 --> 25:58.354
to tell you what I am sure you must already know.

25:58.426 --> 26:01.718
That I adore you, worship you... passionately!.

26:01.793 --> 26:02.687
Mr. Elton, please!.

26:02.807 --> 26:04.729
Forgive me, I can't help myself!.

26:04.798 --> 26:06.425
Dearest Miss Woodhouse...

26:06.500 --> 26:10.727
Emma... release me from torment.
Tell me you return my love.

26:10.805 --> 26:14.604
Tell me you will be my wife,
and make me the happiest man on earth.

26:14.682 --> 26:18.443
Oh, Emma!. I read my answer in your eyes.

26:18.516 --> 26:20.517
Mr. Elton, I am astonished!.

26:20.594 --> 26:23.134
No, no. I am sure you cannot be.

26:23.224 --> 26:24.781
Lovely. Lovely as you are.

26:24.857 --> 26:28.627
Mr. Elton, I think you have drunk too
much of Mr. Weston's good wine.

26:28.696 --> 26:30.647
You have forgot yourself.

26:30.737 --> 26:33.999
I am not Miss Smith, but I shall be happy
to take any message to her.

26:34.070 --> 26:37.859
Miss Smith?. What have I to do with her?.
What do I care about her?.

26:38.040 --> 26:42.431
Who can think of Miss Smith
when Miss Woodhouse is near?.

26:42.691 --> 26:46.413
No, no!. You are all
loveliness and modesty,

26:46.492 --> 26:49.479
but I am sure you could not
have mistaken my intentions.

26:49.557 --> 26:51.458
No, indeed you could not.

26:51.526 --> 26:53.425
Charming Miss Woodhouse!.

26:53.515 --> 26:57.866
Allow me to interpret
this interesting silence.

26:57.946 --> 27:01.308
It confesses that you
have long understood me.

27:01.678 --> 27:05.949
Does it not, lovely... lovely Miss Woodhouse?.

27:06.039 --> 27:08.470
No, sir!. It confesses no such thing!.

27:08.730 --> 27:10.685
I have seen you as my friend's admirer.

27:11.531 --> 27:13.980
In no other light could you be more to me
than an acquaintance.

27:14.057 --> 27:18.453
After all your attentions to Miss Smith,
you never thought seriously of her?.

27:18.533 --> 27:22.134
Miss Smith?. I think seriously of Miss Smith?.

27:22.205 --> 27:26.402
No doubt there are men who might
not object. Everyone has their level.

27:26.476 --> 27:28.408
But I am not quite so much at a loss.

27:29.307 --> 27:32.758
No, madam!. My visits
have been for yourself only.

27:33.188 --> 27:35.479
After all the encouragement
I received.

27:35.552 --> 27:37.145
Encouragement?.

27:37.230 --> 27:40.423
Sir, you've been entirely mistaken
in supposing it.

27:41.931 --> 27:45.353
I'm exceedingly sorry, but it's as well
the mistake ends where it does.

27:45.813 --> 27:48.534
I trust your disappointment
will not be lasting.

27:48.674 --> 27:51.196
I have no thoughts
of matrimony at present.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.655
Good night, Mr. Elton!.

28:12.302 --> 28:13.622
Good night!.

28:18.543 --> 28:21.907
Oh... Harriet!... Harriet!.

28:35.299 --> 28:37.631
Stand up now, gentlemen, please.

28:56.227 --> 28:58.238
It is all my fault!.

28:59.068 --> 29:01.660
Oh, Harriet, can you
ever forgive me?.

29:01.739 --> 29:06.932
There is nothing to forgive,
dear... dear Miss Woodhouse.

29:07.011 --> 29:11.532
I have nothing to complain of. I could
never deserve such a man as Mr. Elton.

29:11.622 --> 29:14.503
Indeed, now I believe
he does not deserve you.

29:15.703 --> 29:18.995
I'm heartily ashamed of myself,
and I am determined to mend my ways.

29:19.095 --> 29:23.006
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, I am sure
none would ever blame you!.

29:24.086 --> 29:26.829
Well, if you forgive me,
I'm not entirely cast down.

29:28.388 --> 29:30.709
I'm going to Ford's. Would you walk with me?.

29:30.909 --> 29:31.969
Yes!.

29:33.043 --> 29:34.260
Miss Woodhouse!.

29:34.345 --> 29:36.261
Oh, Lord, Miss Bates!.

29:36.651 --> 29:38.761
Forgive me, I could not help
but see you.

29:38.841 --> 29:41.815
Jane is here. She arrived this morning.

29:41.892 --> 29:45.054
Mother and I would take it so kindly
if you would step up, Miss Woodhouse.

29:45.134 --> 29:46.724
Miss Smith, too.

29:46.834 --> 29:50.615
- Oh, that is very kind, but...
- Thank you Miss Bates, but we cannot stay long.

29:50.695 --> 29:53.168
Jane will be beside herself with joy.

29:53.236 --> 29:54.647
I doubt it.

29:56.377 --> 30:00.699
Mrs. Goddard told me that Miss Fairfax
is to stay in Highbury with her aunt all summer.

30:01.339 --> 30:03.100
What is she like, Miss Woodhouse?.

30:03.184 --> 30:06.871
Jane Fairfax is a penniless orphan,
brought up in some style

30:06.951 --> 30:09.672
by Colonel Campbell as
a companion to his daughter.

30:09.762 --> 30:13.103
But now the daughter's married
and so Jane must find employment.

30:13.233 --> 30:14.804
Everyone speaks highly of her.

30:14.904 --> 30:17.699
I wish her well, but I'm sick
of the very name of her.

30:17.775 --> 30:19.385
Oh, Miss Woodhouse!.

30:19.665 --> 30:21.274
It was a surprise.

30:21.346 --> 30:24.134
We thought Colonel Campbell
would need the carriage himself,

30:24.212 --> 30:27.741
and you know he would never
send dear Jane post, but as it turned out

30:27.818 --> 30:30.409
they went off to Ireland
two days early.

30:30.489 --> 30:31.199
Indeed!.

30:31.289 --> 30:33.223
Are the whole family gone,
Miss Fairfax?.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.258
Yes, they are in...

30:34.330 --> 30:37.696
Baly-Craig, you know. A beautiful place, I fancy.

30:37.764 --> 30:41.296
Miss Campbell is married to Mr. Dixon now,
so I should call her Mrs. Dixon,

30:41.373 --> 30:42.960
but I always forget.

30:43.037 --> 30:47.915
We should call Miss Campbell Mrs.
Dixon now, mother, should we not?.

30:48.015 --> 30:49.410
She's only a little deaf.

30:49.479 --> 30:53.512
She always hears what Jane says,
but then Jane always speaks so distinct!.

30:53.587 --> 30:56.146
Yes, Mr. Dixon always thought so highly of Jane,

30:56.221 --> 30:58.749
but in the end, I believe they are
very happy

30:58.829 --> 31:00.292
and both very fond of Jane.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.420
We thought she would accompany them.

31:02.500 --> 31:05.591
Jane heard about its beauty from Mr. Dixon,

31:05.671 --> 31:08.603
and because she often walked out with them.

31:08.672 --> 31:10.799
He is a most amiable, charming young man.

31:10.874 --> 31:14.734
Jane was longing to go to Ireland
from his account of things.

31:14.814 --> 31:17.112
But you did not go with them after all!.

31:17.185 --> 31:19.015
I thought it better I should not..

31:19.086 --> 31:21.851
I shall have to earn my bread
sooner or later,

31:21.927 --> 31:27.553
and so resolved that the sooner I made up my mind,
the less pain I should inflict or endure.

31:27.631 --> 31:32.262
Mr... and Mrs... Dixon must
have been very disappointed.

31:34.051 --> 31:38.642
Indeed, they must have been.
Nothing could have been more kind.

31:38.872 --> 31:41.210
Mr. Dixon is not backward
in any attention.

31:41.283 --> 31:45.385
He is a most charming young man ever since
the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth.

31:45.488 --> 31:46.405
Please, aunt!.

31:46.495 --> 31:50.025
No, you will not mind my telling it to
Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith.

31:50.096 --> 31:52.324
Jane nearly met with a terrible calamity.

31:52.397 --> 31:54.593
They were on the water in a boating party.

31:54.668 --> 31:57.935
Jane, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell...
for thus she was then.

31:58.009 --> 32:02.600
And... I think they had gone out rather far
for a squall blew up. And poor Jane,

32:02.678 --> 32:05.532
at the sudden whirling round of something
or other among the sails,

32:05.612 --> 32:07.862
would have been dashed
into the sea at once, oh!.

32:07.962 --> 32:09.033
- Oh!...
- Take my hand!.

32:13.692 --> 32:14.819
Be careful!.

32:19.867 --> 32:24.701
And ever since I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon.
we had the history of that day,

32:24.778 --> 32:28.650
- Oh, what a shocking tale!.
- But one with a happy ending.

33:23.588 --> 33:24.780
No one plays better.

33:24.859 --> 33:29.030
Mr. Dixon would not allow that even
his fiancee was Jane's equal.

33:29.210 --> 33:32.551
She does play and sing
infuriatingly well.

33:32.631 --> 33:34.827
I've rarely heard anything to equal her.

33:34.902 --> 33:36.653
Certainly not from me.

33:36.737 --> 33:37.963
As you say.

33:38.723 --> 33:42.345
But you will not take the pains
to aspire to true excellence.

33:45.326 --> 33:46.345
She would make a good companion for you.

33:47.456 --> 33:50.080
I'm sure you're right,
but I cannot warm to her.

33:50.157 --> 33:54.156
I don't know why. I wish I could, but I can't.

33:54.229 --> 33:57.650
Perhaps because you see in her
the truly accomplished young lady,

33:57.731 --> 33:59.010
you would like to be thought yourself?.

34:00.202 --> 34:03.297
You will make me quite ashamed of myself.

34:05.933 --> 34:07.333
Did you enjoy the music, Mrs. Bates?.

34:07.543 --> 34:09.204
She's only a very little deaf,
you know.

34:09.304 --> 34:12.341
Beautifully played, did not you
think so, Miss Woodhouse?.

34:12.418 --> 34:13.679
Oh, yes!.

34:17.558 --> 34:21.056
Mrs. Weston tells me Mr. Frank Churchill
was at Weymouth.

34:21.129 --> 34:23.188
Was he there at the same time as you?.

34:23.268 --> 34:25.599
Yes, I think he was for some of the time.

34:25.670 --> 34:28.896
Were you acquainted with him?.
Did you have any conversation?.

34:28.974 --> 34:30.841
A little, yes.

34:31.632 --> 34:35.045
I have to tell you he is a young gentleman
in whom I have the keenest interest.

34:35.123 --> 34:39.654
You know he is Mr. Weston's son,
and we expect a visit from him very soon.

34:39.754 --> 34:42.155
We've never seem him in Highbury.

34:42.264 --> 34:44.652
What is he really like?. Is he handsome?.

34:44.728 --> 34:46.822
He's reckoned to be a very fine young man.

34:46.898 --> 34:48.763
And is he agreeable?.

34:48.837 --> 34:50.960
He is generally thought so.

34:51.748 --> 34:53.469
But... what did you think of him?.

34:54.579 --> 34:57.168
When one's in company all the time,
at such a place as Weymouth,

34:57.244 --> 34:59.141
it is difficult to form a just impressión.

35:00.301 --> 35:02.752
I think everybody found his manners pleasing.

35:03.983 --> 35:05.743
I see I shall have to be content with that.

35:11.705 --> 35:13.893
And all this is Mr. Knightley's?.

35:13.967 --> 35:15.333
Of course!.

35:15.407 --> 35:17.007
There is Donwell Abbey.

35:17.527 --> 35:19.738
And all these farms belong to the Donwell estate,

35:19.818 --> 35:23.369
and everyone who lives here is a tenant
of Mr. Knightley's, or his servant.

35:24.750 --> 35:27.631
I should never have thought that one man
could own so much.

35:30.162 --> 35:32.923
The sparrows and the skylarks
don't belong to Mr. Knightley, do they?.

35:33.283 --> 35:35.784
Perhaps not, but the woodcock
and the pheasant certainly do.

35:35.864 --> 35:36.814
Drive on!.

35:36.894 --> 35:37.874
Hup!.

35:44.076 --> 35:47.107
Don't you think it is pretty
and well-kept, Miss Woodhouse?.

35:47.708 --> 35:49.318
Very well kept.

35:49.918 --> 35:54.615
Oh, dear!, now the time is come I feel
so very strange and not quite easy,

35:54.690 --> 35:56.721
about seeing the Martins after.

35:58.321 --> 35:59.652
But I must be sensible.

35:59.742 --> 36:01.993
Yes, you must, Harriet.

36:02.103 --> 36:04.753
Tell your friends you can only stay 15 minutes.

36:05.064 --> 36:06.444
There will be no danger in that.

36:07.338 --> 36:07.985
Yes!.

36:09.275 --> 36:10.241
Yes!.

36:14.482 --> 36:17.788
Drive on, James, to the end of the lane,
and turn the carriage.

37:00.744 --> 37:02.735
It was not quite comfortable at first.

37:02.813 --> 37:05.784
But then Mrs. Martin said she thought
I'd grown since the summer.

37:05.974 --> 37:09.956
And we went to see the marks on the
wainscot, where Mr. Martin had measured us,

37:10.036 --> 37:10.886
and they measured me again.

37:11.046 --> 37:13.897
And Mrs. Martin said I had grown a good half inch.

37:14.507 --> 37:16.938
And we were all beginning
to be ourselves again.

37:17.178 --> 37:19.949
And then just at the end,
What do you think?.

37:20.069 --> 37:22.437
Mr. Martin himself came in.

37:22.510 --> 37:24.236
And what then?.

37:24.309 --> 37:25.606
Oh, nothing!.

37:25.681 --> 37:29.205
He excused himself for being dirty
and went away to wash himself.

37:29.282 --> 37:31.983
And then it was time for me to come away.

37:37.626 --> 37:39.993
- I must come.
- I shall come.

37:46.705 --> 37:47.719
Ah, Miss Woodhouse!.

37:47.819 --> 37:53.731
Emma, allow me to present to you my son,
Mr. Frank Churchill.

37:53.815 --> 37:56.376
Miss Woodhouse.

37:59.756 --> 38:01.621
We meet at last!.

38:05.645 --> 38:06.905
How do you like my son, Mr. Woodhouse?.

38:07.015 --> 38:08.936
I was extremely happy to meet Mrs. Weston.

38:10.020 --> 38:14.428
I was sure I would like her, from her letters,
but I didn't expect to see such beauty.

38:15.428 --> 38:15.998
I had imagined...

38:16.078 --> 38:20.240
Well, a tolerably well-looking
woman of a certain age.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.561
I didn't expect to see a pretty, young woman.

38:24.121 --> 38:26.562
Mr. Churchill, you couldn't
praise her too highly for me,

38:26.643 --> 38:30.923
but you mustn't let Mrs. Weston hear you
speaking of her as a pretty, young woman.

38:31.437 --> 38:33.234
Oh!, I hope I should know better.

38:33.354 --> 38:37.958
I know whom I might praise
without being thought extravagant in my terms.

38:39.066 --> 38:41.327
I must be going. I have business at the Crown.

38:42.307 --> 38:43.678
But I needn't hurry anybody else.

38:43.928 --> 38:48.760
If you have business, sir, perhaps I should pay a visit.

38:48.874 --> 38:51.776
A neighbor of yours... the name is Fairfax?.

38:51.851 --> 38:55.512
I believe the family are
called Barnes... or Bates?.

38:55.622 --> 38:57.353
Of course we know Mrs. Bates.

38:57.693 --> 39:00.814
We passed by the house. Miss Bates was at the window.

39:01.357 --> 39:03.855
Miss Fairfax, of course, you met at Weymouth.

39:03.965 --> 39:05.757
A fine girl... call upon her.

39:05.835 --> 39:08.958
Oh, it is of little matter. Another day would do as well.

39:09.037 --> 39:11.377
But there was that degree
of acquaintance at Weymouth...

39:11.567 --> 39:15.499
Go today, go today!. What's right to be done
cannot be done too soon.

39:15.729 --> 39:17.599
If you don't call early,
it will be a slight.

39:18.180 --> 39:19.943
Nothing for it, then.

39:20.861 --> 39:24.062
I hope that you will have time
to introduce me to Highbury, Miss Woodhouse.

39:24.322 --> 39:26.218
And show me all the points
of interest.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.601
This is the Crown Inn.

39:36.346 --> 39:39.077
That looks a fine room on the first floor.

39:39.177 --> 39:41.735
One could hold a very good ball there.

39:41.811 --> 39:44.076
I believe it was a ballroom
many years ago.

39:44.149 --> 39:47.970
Then we must revive it,
restore its former glory.

39:48.050 --> 39:49.300
Are you fond of dancing?.

39:49.380 --> 39:51.061
Oh, very fond, indeed!,

39:51.341 --> 39:54.172
but there are too few young people
in the village now to hold a dance.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.402
Surely not!.

39:55.662 --> 39:59.454
I'm sure we shall find enough, even if
we have to send out as far as Leatherhead.

40:00.044 --> 40:04.125
No, a ball there shall be!.
And you and I shall dance at it.

40:05.042 --> 40:06.805
And there's the Bates house.

40:06.877 --> 40:10.811
You see, I am getting to be quite at home
in Highbury already.

40:10.888 --> 40:12.548
Did you pay your visit yesterday?.

40:12.908 --> 40:16.084
Yes... Oh, yes!, I was just going to mention it.

40:16.159 --> 40:17.954
I thought it would never end.

40:18.030 --> 40:21.622
Ten minutes would have sufficed,
but there was no getting away.

40:21.701 --> 40:24.392
The talking aunt, you know.

40:24.752 --> 40:26.493
I was there three quarters of an hour.

40:27.305 --> 40:28.864
How did Miss Fairfax look?.

40:28.954 --> 40:32.545
¡Oh... Very ill!.

40:33.175 --> 40:35.045
If ladies can be allowed to look ill.

40:35.116 --> 40:37.277
A most deplorable want of complexion.

40:37.377 --> 40:39.252
No, I won't allow that!.

40:39.327 --> 40:43.739
Miss Fairfax has her own style of beauty.
Perhaps it's not to your taste.

40:43.839 --> 40:45.239
Yes, perhaps that's it.

40:45.840 --> 40:50.051
Yes. I believe you're right.

40:50.803 --> 40:54.593
Did you see her often at Weymouth?.
Were you often in the same society?.

40:54.673 --> 40:56.506
Ah!... This must be Ford's

40:56.583 --> 40:59.824
that everybody attends
every day of their lives.

41:00.884 --> 41:04.156
Let's go in!, then I can prove myself
a true citizen of Highbury.

41:04.746 --> 41:06.437
I must buy something at Ford's.

41:07.027 --> 41:08.437
I daresay they sell gloves?.

41:08.807 --> 41:13.625
Oh, yes!, lay out half a guinea in Ford's
and you'll be adored by all Highbury.

41:18.874 --> 41:21.482
And what more delights does Highbury
have in store for me?.

41:21.692 --> 41:23.753
Oh!, I fear we are coming
to the end of them.

41:24.753 --> 41:26.684
This is Mr. Elton's house.

41:26.764 --> 41:27.724
Ah!...

41:27.820 --> 41:31.089
It's rather small, of course, but quite suitable for him.

41:31.165 --> 41:34.859
Mr. Elton is the vicar, and considered by some
to be a very fine young man.

41:34.936 --> 41:38.007
Oh, I know a good deal of Mr. Elton
though I've never met him.

41:38.108 --> 41:39.067
Really?.

41:39.138 --> 41:43.064
I know he is at present in Bath, just recently engaged

41:43.140 --> 41:45.540
and shortly to be married to a Miss Augusta Hawkins of Bristol

41:45.620 --> 41:48.041
with a fortune of 10,000 pounds.

41:48.621 --> 41:50.712
Then you know more than I do.

41:50.792 --> 41:52.703
Oh, I had it from Miss Bates.

41:52.793 --> 41:56.054
Everybody is full of it...
agog to see Mr. Elton's bride.

41:56.874 --> 41:59.719
So, this is where they will live.

41:59.796 --> 42:02.163
I think they'll be very snug and happy.

42:02.236 --> 42:05.737
It's a perfectly good house
to share with a woman you truly love.

42:07.007 --> 42:10.238
A man would be a blockhead who wanted more.

42:11.812 --> 42:16.813
You can say this... you, who have been used
to Enscombe with every degree of luxury?.

42:16.891 --> 42:18.877
Oh, I care nothing for Enscombe.

42:18.954 --> 42:23.723
What is the good of wealth and luxury
where there is no true happiness?.

42:29.002 --> 42:31.471
Shall we make the full circle to Randalls?.

42:31.546 --> 42:35.132
You see?. I have got my bearings.

42:41.785 --> 42:43.185
Thank you, Jane.

42:43.260 --> 42:45.348
This is a handsome instrument.

42:45.424 --> 42:47.415
Do you play, Miss Woodhouse?.

42:47.493 --> 42:50.927
Of course!... but not very well.

42:51.002 --> 42:53.043
Not nearly as well as Jane Fairfax.

42:53.433 --> 42:54.354
Have you heard her play?.

42:54.454 --> 42:56.932
Yes, once or twice at Weymouth.

42:57.006 --> 43:00.735
She appeared to me to play well, but
I know nothing of the matter myself.

43:00.816 --> 43:04.179
Though one of the party always
preferred Miss Fairfax's playing

43:04.257 --> 43:05.477
to that of his fiancee.

43:05.557 --> 43:08.486
So, Mr. Dixon is musical, is he?.

43:09.929 --> 43:12.910
Yes, Mr. And Mrs. Dixon were the persons.

43:13.580 --> 43:16.601
I thought it a very strong proof
of Miss Fairfax's excellence.

43:16.711 --> 43:18.012
Proof, indeed!.

43:18.752 --> 43:24.809
But, wasn't Miss Fairfax embarrassed
at this preference of Mr. Dixon's?.

43:24.884 --> 43:28.472
And did he perhaps prefer her
in other ways, too?.

43:29.550 --> 43:32.884
I... I really cannot say.

43:32.957 --> 43:37.051
No, who can tell what Jane Fairfax is feeling?.

43:37.128 --> 43:39.322
She is so very reserved.

43:39.399 --> 43:43.050
I could never attach myself to anyone
so completely reserved.

43:43.130 --> 43:43.981
¡No!.

43:44.841 --> 43:47.142
There is safety in reserve, but no attraction.

43:48.132 --> 43:50.373
One cannot love a reserved person.

43:52.283 --> 43:55.585
Father, I believe I must
go to London tomorrow.

43:55.915 --> 43:56.975
To London?.

43:57.055 --> 43:58.456
Whatever for?.

43:58.556 --> 44:00.250
To get his hair cut?.

44:00.326 --> 44:05.559
I fear he has, Mr. Knightley.
16 miles there and 16 miles back.

44:05.638 --> 44:08.309
I called him a coxcomb,
but he would not be dissuaded.

44:08.402 --> 44:10.590
Foppery and nonsense!.

44:10.820 --> 44:13.231
All young people will have their
little whims, Mr. Knightley.

44:13.601 --> 44:14.731
Yes, I see!.

44:15.945 --> 44:19.053
Just the sort of trifling,
silly fellow I took him for!.

44:19.133 --> 44:24.404
I hope he will not get it cut too short,
I'm very much afraid he will catch cold from it.

44:24.504 --> 44:26.815
You will excuse me now, Mr. Woodhouse.

44:26.905 --> 44:30.066
I have some business to attend to,
which I postponed to be here.

44:30.827 --> 44:34.088
I shall meet this young man
at your party for him, Mrs. Weston.

44:34.388 --> 44:36.565
I bid you all good day.

44:53.144 --> 44:56.115
It is a pianoforte, mother.!.

45:11.501 --> 45:13.024
This is coming as you should do.

45:13.102 --> 45:16.452
Using your carriage for once like a gentleman,
instead of walking everywhere.

45:16.702 --> 45:18.863
Lucky we should arrive at the same moment,

45:18.943 --> 45:21.354
or you wouldn't have noticed
that I'm more of a gentleman than usual.

45:21.684 --> 45:23.475
Yes, I should, I'm sure I should!.

45:23.805 --> 45:25.115
Nonsensical girl!.

45:25.818 --> 45:27.844
It was the greatest surprise!.

45:27.926 --> 45:30.117
Really quite the finest you could wish for.

45:30.197 --> 45:32.238
Not a grand, but a large-sized square one.

45:32.328 --> 45:33.989
A very elegant-looking instrument.

45:34.068 --> 45:36.532
It arrived just yesterday
without any direction.

45:36.609 --> 45:39.092
Jane herself was at a loss
who it could be from.

45:39.170 --> 45:40.090
What a mystery!.

45:40.180 --> 45:44.732
Ah, but now we conclude it could only be
from one quarter, do we not, Jane?.

45:44.812 --> 45:47.933
For, who else could it be from
but Colonel Campbell?.

45:48.023 --> 45:49.380
I declare, I don't know...

45:49.454 --> 45:51.146
What are they talking about?.

45:51.224 --> 45:52.465
It seems that some mysterious person

45:52.545 --> 45:55.646
has made Miss Fairfax
the present of a pianoforte.

45:57.396 --> 45:58.817
Why do you smile?.

45:58.897 --> 46:01.999
Nay, why do you?. I smile because you smile.

46:02.908 --> 46:04.399
Why, do you suspect something?.

46:04.859 --> 46:07.230
If Colonel Campbell is not the giver,
who can be?.

46:08.210 --> 46:10.171
What do you say to Mr. Dixon?.

46:11.571 --> 46:16.003
I cannot help suspecting that he may have
had the misfortune to fall in love with her.

46:16.093 --> 46:18.944
You're sure it couldn't
have come from the colonel?.

46:19.024 --> 46:22.065
If it was the colonel, she would have guessed
at once and not been puzzled.

46:22.695 --> 46:25.246
I have no doubt at all
it was an offering of love.

46:25.766 --> 46:27.226
An offering of love?.

46:29.671 --> 46:33.779
You have convinced me... I believe it was.

46:36.180 --> 46:41.710
"It was early in the month of may".

46:41.791 --> 46:47.386
"Down by the green fields
I chanced to stray".

46:47.463 --> 46:51.258
"I heard a young maiden sigh",

46:51.335 --> 46:55.206
"and say that the man she loved"

46:55.296 --> 46:58.300
"had strayed away".

47:00.212 --> 47:04.673
"Oh, father, father!, build me a boat"

47:04.751 --> 47:07.152
"for it's over to Ireland".

47:07.230 --> 47:11.654
"I'm yearning to float, to search for my true love",

47:11.732 --> 47:14.132
"through tempest and storm",

47:14.213 --> 47:20.355
"for I know in her arms I'm safe from all harm".

47:22.165 --> 47:24.166
Encore!. Encore!.

47:24.246 --> 47:27.517
No, no!. I thank you, but you have had quite enough from me.

47:29.084 --> 47:32.059
Miss Fairfax, would you give us
the great pleasure of hearing you?.

47:32.159 --> 47:33.849
Yes, if you wish, Mr. Knightley.

47:34.625 --> 47:37.724
Ah, Miss Smith!. Keeping well, I trust.

47:37.801 --> 47:39.093
No more throats?.

47:39.171 --> 47:42.164
¡Oh, no!, I'm very well now. Thank you, Mr. Perry.

47:52.081 --> 47:56.097
I shall have been here a week tomorrow...
half my time.

47:56.287 --> 47:58.654
I never knew days fly so fast.

47:58.728 --> 48:01.689
Perhaps you now regret spending one of them
in having your hair cut.

48:01.919 --> 48:04.490
No, that is nosubject of regret.

48:14.011 --> 48:15.103
What's the matter?.

48:18.584 --> 48:20.255
I was struck by...

48:22.116 --> 48:26.116
Really, Miss Fairfax has done
her hair in so very odd a way.

48:26.197 --> 48:28.208
I never saw anything so outré!.

48:29.038 --> 48:33.160
I must go and ask her whether it's
an Irish fashion... Shall I?.

48:33.370 --> 48:35.062
No, no, you shouldn't.

48:38.510 --> 48:40.445
Yes, I will!.

48:40.522 --> 48:44.633
You shall see how she takes it.
See whether she blushes.

48:44.733 --> 48:46.687
Do excuse me, Miss Bates.

49:08.152 --> 49:09.962
I have been making discoveries, Emma.

49:10.292 --> 49:13.717
Did you know that Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax came here

49:13.793 --> 49:15.384
in Mr. Knightley's own carriage,

49:15.464 --> 49:17.486
and are to go home again The same way?.

49:18.095 --> 49:22.056
Is that not a marked attention from Mr. Knightley
who never uses his carriage himself?.

49:22.136 --> 49:25.938
Yes, it is, but it is just the sort of
kindness I would expect from him.

49:26.842 --> 49:29.489
He's not a gallant man, but he's a very humane one.

49:30.029 --> 49:33.950
"... Toil when on my charmless breast repose",

49:33.985 --> 49:37.952
"and I would love you all the day".

49:38.032 --> 49:39.702
"Every night we will..."

49:39.792 --> 49:44.629
What do you say to Mr. Knightley and Miss Fairfax?.

49:44.704 --> 49:49.371
¡No!... and cut my little nephew, Henry
out of inheriting Donwell?.

49:49.446 --> 49:50.656
Never!.

49:51.997 --> 49:55.639
Besides, he does not care
about Jane Fairfax...

49:55.718 --> 49:56.358
in the way of love.

49:56.438 --> 49:58.149
I am sure he does not.

49:59.389 --> 50:01.820
He is a great admirer of her talents.

50:01.900 --> 50:04.841
What if he should have
sent for this pianoforte?.

50:04.931 --> 50:07.152
One tiny one, I insist!. I absolutely insist!.

50:07.252 --> 50:09.392
My dear sir, I must intervene.

50:09.733 --> 50:14.184
If Miss Fairfax says she is tired,
Then we should have the courtesy to believe her.

50:15.645 --> 50:18.025
Would you have her sing herself hoarse?.

50:19.012 --> 50:21.607
Come, Miss Fairfax, you have earned a rest.

50:21.687 --> 50:22.647
Thank you.

50:28.649 --> 50:32.089
Miss Woodhouse, I have come here
determined to dance,

50:32.163 --> 50:34.741
and nothing will satisfy me
but that you and I shall show the way.

50:35.371 --> 50:36.602
Will you?.

50:37.022 --> 50:38.122
With pleasure.

51:06.242 --> 51:07.993
But what about little Henry?.

51:15.935 --> 51:17.446
So obliged to you for your visit.

51:17.526 --> 51:20.585
Jane will be so pleased
to show you the new instrument.

51:20.661 --> 51:24.188
Mr. Frank Churchill is here already
fastening the rivets of my mother's spectacles.

51:24.268 --> 51:25.809
He really is so very...

51:26.209 --> 51:28.670
Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse,
remember the step at the turning.

51:28.980 --> 51:31.901
Miss Smith, the step at the turning.

51:37.584 --> 51:40.315
Ah!... This is a pleasure.

51:41.694 --> 51:44.055
You find me occupied in trying to be useful.

51:44.595 --> 51:47.746
The pianoforte would not stand steady.

51:47.836 --> 51:49.787
You see, we've been wedging it with paper.

51:50.377 --> 51:53.897
Will you try it now, Miss Fairfax?.
Just a few notes.

52:00.414 --> 52:01.421
Ah, yes!.

52:02.101 --> 52:05.272
You hear that softness in the upper notes.

52:05.392 --> 52:08.722
Just what those in Mr. Dixon's
party particularly prized.

52:08.793 --> 52:10.434
I think it is such a fine instrument,

52:10.514 --> 52:12.925
and suits Jane's style of playing very well.

52:13.866 --> 52:16.961
Mr. Dixon, I believe valued that tone particularly.

52:17.037 --> 52:19.437
It isn't fair. Don't distress her.

52:20.327 --> 52:22.668
Oh, what felicity to hear that tune again!.

52:23.618 --> 52:26.599
If I mistake not, that was danced at Weymouth.

52:36.096 --> 52:37.853
Now, here's something new...

52:39.167 --> 52:40.930
A set of Irish melodies.

52:41.004 --> 52:43.705
Now, that was thoughtful of whoever sent the instrument.

52:44.015 --> 52:47.757
That betokens true affection, I believe.

52:50.428 --> 52:51.428
Oh, but I'm forgetting!.

52:52.208 --> 52:55.079
Our ball is arranged for next Saturday at the Crown.

52:55.169 --> 52:57.450
My father is all enthusiasm..

52:57.690 --> 53:00.276
I have permissión from Enscombe to extend my stay,

53:00.352 --> 53:02.372
so I shall hope to see you all there.

53:02.452 --> 53:05.783
And, Miss Woodhouse, I hope it is not too soon,

53:05.863 --> 53:08.358
to secure you for the first
two dances of the evening.

53:24.029 --> 53:26.730
Why!, I could almost fancy myself at Maple Grove.

53:26.970 --> 53:29.261
My brother-in-law, Mr. Suckling's seat,
you know?.

53:29.587 --> 53:33.312
Yes!, the morning room there is
just such a shape and size as this.

53:33.392 --> 53:34.883
- Mr. E!.
- Yes, my love?.

53:35.223 --> 53:38.294
Is this room not astonishingly like the
morning room at Maple Grove?.

53:38.584 --> 53:42.595
Very like indeed, Augusta.
No one observes things as you do.

53:42.936 --> 53:45.376
I am extremely partial to Maple Grove.

53:45.776 --> 53:48.574
My relations will be enchanted with this place.

53:48.647 --> 53:51.999
People with extensive grounds always enjoy
anything in the same style.

53:52.199 --> 53:55.770
When you've seen more of the country,
you may think you've overrated Hartfield.

53:56.170 --> 53:57.521
Surrey is full of beauties.

53:57.631 --> 53:59.792
Oh, yes!, I am aware of that.

53:59.881 --> 54:01.192
It is the garden of England, you know.

54:01.672 --> 54:03.863
Surrey is the garden of England!.

54:04.003 --> 54:06.765
Many counties, I believe, are
called "The Garden of England".

54:06.844 --> 54:07.964
Kent, and Evesham too.

54:08.044 --> 54:10.668
No, I fancy not.

54:10.745 --> 54:13.178
I never heard any county
but Surrey called so.

54:13.256 --> 54:16.377
My brother and sister have promised
us a visit in the summer.

54:16.607 --> 54:20.138
They will have their "barouche-landau", of course.

54:20.628 --> 54:24.250
But, you will have many parties
of that kind, Miss Woodhouse?.

54:24.330 --> 54:27.571
No, not many... we are a very quiet set of people.

54:28.001 --> 54:31.042
Well!, we must do something about that,
must we not, Mr. E?.

54:31.132 --> 54:32.195
Indeed, Augusta!.

54:34.053 --> 54:35.709
We've been calling at Randalls,

54:35.784 --> 54:37.964
and very pleasant people they seem to be.

54:38.447 --> 54:41.436
Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature.

54:41.526 --> 54:44.547
Quite a first-rate favorite with me already.

54:44.717 --> 54:46.977
And Mrs. Weston... she was your governess?.

54:47.057 --> 54:49.388
I was astonished to find her so ladylike.

54:49.468 --> 54:50.519
Quite the gentlewoman.

54:50.599 --> 54:54.240
.Ah!. And, who do you think came
in while we were there?.

54:54.690 --> 54:57.168
Knightley!. Knightley himself!.

54:57.241 --> 55:00.862
My "caro sposo" had spoken of "my friend Knightley".

55:00.942 --> 55:05.514
Well!, he need not be ashamed of his friend.
Knightley is quite the gentleman.

55:05.594 --> 55:07.107
And then Jane Fairfax.

55:07.665 --> 55:11.586
Oh!, I quite rave about poor Jane Fairfax.

55:12.386 --> 55:14.367
And I've resolved to do what I can for her.

55:14.447 --> 55:17.348
I shall look out for a situation for her
as a governess.

55:17.918 --> 55:19.248
Insufferable woman!.

55:19.485 --> 55:21.510
With her "caro sposo" and her "Mr. E."!.

55:22.209 --> 55:24.680
Actually, to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman!.

55:24.760 --> 55:26.811
I thought she was a very
pretty sort of young lady,

55:26.901 --> 55:29.432
though she speaks a little too quick.

55:29.732 --> 55:31.673
No doubt she will make him a good wife.

55:32.303 --> 55:34.494
But I think he had better not have married.

55:34.834 --> 55:35.884
Come, come, Mr. Woodhouse.

55:35.964 --> 55:38.065
You mustn't be an enemy to every marriage.

55:39.035 --> 55:42.486
And poor Jane Fairfax!. Whatever her faults,
has not deserved this.

55:43.127 --> 55:45.598
To be pitied and patronized by such a person!.

55:45.708 --> 55:49.043
And now she must spend almost every day with the Eltons!.

55:49.119 --> 55:50.773
With her taste and her pride!.

55:50.849 --> 55:52.213
How could she endure it?.

55:52.290 --> 55:54.661
Perhaps it is better than being always at home.

55:54.921 --> 55:58.385
You're right, Mrs. Weston!. Miss Fairfax
might prefer to be invited by others,

55:58.462 --> 56:02.413
but she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton
which no one else pays her.

56:02.803 --> 56:04.284
She deserves better.

56:04.364 --> 56:06.605
I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax.

56:07.495 --> 56:11.186
Yes!. Anybody may know how highly I think of her.

56:36.241 --> 56:37.985
Mr. Churchill, ma'am.

56:55.633 --> 56:58.729
I come as the bearer of evil tidings.

56:58.805 --> 57:00.204
For me they are.

57:01.944 --> 57:03.304
Mrs. Churchill is ill.

57:04.214 --> 57:06.095
I must leave immediately for Enscombe.

57:06.765 --> 57:08.406
¡Oh!, I am very sorry to hear it.

57:08.496 --> 57:10.212
I hope it is not very severe.

57:10.306 --> 57:11.677
Who can tell?.

57:12.147 --> 57:14.688
But it would seem she is far too
unwell to do without me.

57:15.538 --> 57:18.669
I daresay I shall arrive at Enscombe
and find her quite recovered.

57:19.810 --> 57:22.827
You see how it is... I cannot refuse to go.

57:22.904 --> 57:24.872
No, of course you cannot!.

57:28.483 --> 57:32.734
Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.

57:32.814 --> 57:34.705
But you will come again.

57:35.235 --> 57:37.848
This will not be your only visit to Highbury.

57:39.054 --> 57:42.217
Ah!, I suppose our poor ball must be quite given up.

57:42.648 --> 57:44.128
For the present.

57:44.918 --> 57:47.222
But if and when I get away, we shall have it.

57:47.500 --> 57:49.420
Don't forget your engagement.

57:49.500 --> 57:52.771
No, I promise you that!. The first two dances!.

57:53.351 --> 57:56.352
It has been... such a fortnight!.

57:57.243 --> 58:00.534
Every day more precious than the day before.

58:01.004 --> 58:05.535
Every day... making me less fit to bear
any other place.

58:07.327 --> 58:09.697
And you must be off this very morning?.

58:10.287 --> 58:13.268
Sí!... my father is to join me here.

58:13.398 --> 58:15.839
We will walk back together,
and I must be off immediately.

58:16.879 --> 58:19.810
Not five minutes to spare
even for Miss Fairfaxand Miss Bates?.

58:20.110 --> 58:22.208
Oh, yes!, I have called there...

58:23.221 --> 58:25.642
passing the door. I thought it the right thing to do.

58:27.873 --> 58:28.823
In short...

58:31.004 --> 58:32.185
Perhaps, Miss. Woodhouse...

58:32.695 --> 58:36.506
I think you can hardly be quite without suspición...

58:39.097 --> 58:39.707
Ah!.

58:42.998 --> 58:44.259
This will be my father.

58:45.969 --> 58:47.541
Better not to disturb Mr. Woodhouse.

58:49.016 --> 58:53.818
I... hope we shall meet again before too long.

58:58.534 --> 58:59.621
Good-bye!.

59:10.918 --> 59:12.310
I have been thinking...

59:12.449 --> 59:14.418
Forgive me, Miss Woodhouse,

59:14.489 --> 59:19.547
but, are you very sad that Mr. Frank Churchill
has had to go away?.

59:20.271 --> 59:21.211
I had thought that...

59:21.321 --> 59:25.398
Yes, so did I, Harriet, but I find
I bear his absence very well.

59:26.343 --> 59:29.058
I believe I've enjoyed every moment
I've spent in his company.

59:29.134 --> 59:32.885
But I suspect he's not necessary to my happiness.

59:34.177 --> 59:36.042
Now, Jane, you shall not escape me.

59:36.116 --> 59:38.507
Here is April come and June will soon be here!.

59:38.637 --> 59:40.108
I get quite anxious about you.

59:40.608 --> 59:41.818
Have your really heard of nothing?.

59:42.078 --> 59:45.620
Oh!. A situation such as you deserve
is no everyday occurrence!.

59:46.270 --> 59:48.521
You've already missed the opportunity with Mrs. Bragge,

59:49.121 --> 59:51.392
a cousin of Mr. Suckling of Maple Grove.

59:51.732 --> 59:54.763
The whole worid was dying to
be governess in that family.

59:55.033 --> 59:56.964
Wax candles in the schoolroom!.

59:57.164 --> 59:58.674
You may imagine how desirable.

59:59.375 --> 01:00:00.885
But let us not lose hope.

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:02.665
We must begin inquiring for you directly.

01:00:02.745 --> 01:00:04.186
I beg you would not, Mrs. Elton.

01:00:05.076 --> 01:00:08.778
There are places in town where...
an enquiry would soon produce employment...

01:00:09.489 --> 01:00:12.289
Offices for the sale, not quite of human flesh,
but of human intellect.

01:00:12.569 --> 01:00:13.999
My dear, you quite shock me!.

01:00:14.079 --> 01:00:16.944
If you mean a fling at the slave trade,

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:19.380
I assure you Mr. Suckling was
a friend to the abolition.

01:00:19.451 --> 01:00:22.320
No, no!. The governess trade was all I had in view.

01:00:22.392 --> 01:00:25.753
Different as to the guilt of those who carry it on.

01:00:26.324 --> 01:00:29.445
But as to the misery of its victims,
I'm not sure where it lies.

01:00:34.136 --> 01:00:35.557
Mr. Weston!.

01:00:36.797 --> 01:00:39.298
Mr. Weston, have you dined?.

01:00:39.378 --> 01:00:42.845
No, no, no, don't disturb yourselves!.
Yes, I have dined.

01:00:42.919 --> 01:00:45.850
I just returned from London
and I came straight round.

01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:48.811
My dear, Frank is coming again.

01:00:48.891 --> 01:00:51.757
Next week. The whole family.

01:00:51.832 --> 01:00:54.160
Milder air, you know, for Mrs. Churchill.

01:00:54.233 --> 01:00:56.222
They have taken a house at Richmond.

01:00:56.304 --> 01:00:58.360
He'll be able to ride over every day.

01:00:58.436 --> 01:01:01.565
Well, Emma, this is good news for you.

01:01:01.646 --> 01:01:04.235
You shall have your ball at the Crown after all.

01:01:39.068 --> 01:01:42.810
- This is admirable!.
- Excellently contrived.

01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:45.131
Upon my word, nothing lacking.
Could not have imagined it!.

01:01:45.271 --> 01:01:47.601
Jane, Jane, look!. Did you ever see anything like it?.

01:01:48.532 --> 01:01:50.139
Mr. Knightley, it was...

01:01:55.974 --> 01:01:58.663
A very fine young man, indeed, Mr. Weston.

01:01:58.745 --> 01:02:01.229
You may believe me, I never compliment.

01:02:01.307 --> 01:02:05.945
So truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.

01:02:06.018 --> 01:02:08.346
I am extremely pleased with him.

01:02:08.418 --> 01:02:09.611
Thank you, Mrs. Elton.

01:02:09.689 --> 01:02:11.950
I have yet to meet anyone who did not like my son.

01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:16.091
Ah!, but you must know I can be
very severe upon young men.

01:02:16.181 --> 01:02:19.142
I have a vast dislike of
puppies, quite a horror of them.

01:02:19.392 --> 01:02:21.203
Had he turned out to be a puppy,

01:02:21.283 --> 01:02:24.094
I might have said some very
cutting things, you may be sure.

01:02:24.254 --> 01:02:27.935
I am a scourge of puppies, am I not, Mr. E.?.

01:02:28.015 --> 01:02:29.807
Indeed you are, Augusta.

01:02:29.886 --> 01:02:33.967
Woe betide any puppy who
ventures into your society.

01:03:02.497 --> 01:03:06.551
Oh, Mr. Weston, you must
have had Aladdin's lamp!.

01:03:06.628 --> 01:03:08.823
Good Mrs. Stokes would
never know her room again.

01:03:08.899 --> 01:03:10.832
I saw her just now.

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:12.731
"Did you not wet
your feet?", she said.

01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:14.361
"No, we did not", I said, "did we, Jane?".

01:03:14.441 --> 01:03:16.873
There was a mat, and Mr. Frank Churchill
was so extremely...

01:03:16.952 --> 01:03:19.002
And there he is now, dancing.

01:03:19.083 --> 01:03:23.609
Mr. Frank Churchill cuts a very fine figure,
does he not, Mr. Knightley?.

01:03:23.684 --> 01:03:24.845
Very sprightly.

01:03:24.925 --> 01:03:27.548
Very sprightly... indeed, that is the word.

01:03:27.626 --> 01:03:29.818
And so well partnered in Miss Woodhouse!.

01:03:29.896 --> 01:03:32.555
They make a pretty pair, do they not, Jane?.

01:03:32.629 --> 01:03:34.628
They might have been made to stand up together.

01:04:16.822 --> 01:04:18.415
Do you not dance, Mr. Elton?.

01:04:18.493 --> 01:04:21.518
Most readily, Mrs. Weston,
if you will dance with me.

01:04:21.595 --> 01:04:24.485
Me?. Oh, no!. I would get you a better partner.

01:04:24.675 --> 01:04:28.963
If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance, it would
give me very great pleasure, I'm sure.

01:04:29.047 --> 01:04:31.303
Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance,

01:04:31.377 --> 01:04:34.572
but here is a young lady disengaged... Miss Smith.

01:04:34.649 --> 01:04:36.580
Miss Smith!.

01:04:36.659 --> 01:04:39.209
I am much obliged to you.

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:41.982
I did not notice... Miss Smith.

01:04:43.061 --> 01:04:47.093
But I am an old married man now.
My dancing days are over.

01:04:47.173 --> 01:04:49.657
You will excuse me, Mrs. Weston.

01:04:59.837 --> 01:05:01.340
Ah, Mr. Knightley!.

01:05:01.418 --> 01:05:02.858
Excuse me, sir!.

01:05:18.444 --> 01:05:22.525
I see Knightley has taken pity
on poor little Miss Smith!.

01:05:23.675 --> 01:05:25.976
Very good-natured, I declare.

01:06:05.401 --> 01:06:06.595
That was well done!.

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:09.381
I think they aimed at wounding more than Harriet.

01:06:10.401 --> 01:06:12.270
Why are they your enemies, Emma?.

01:06:12.352 --> 01:06:14.043
Perhaps I can guess in Mr. Elton's case.

01:06:14.123 --> 01:06:16.193
Confess, you did want him to marry Harriet?.

01:06:17.054 --> 01:06:19.614
Yes, I did, and they cannot forgive me.

01:06:20.415 --> 01:06:23.426
I admit now, I was completely mistaken
in Mr. Elton.

01:06:23.536 --> 01:06:26.417
There is a littleness about him
which you discovered, and I did not.

01:06:27.397 --> 01:06:31.066
Well, in my turn, I'll admit
I underestimated Harriet Smith.

01:06:32.249 --> 01:06:35.430
She has some first-rate qualities,
which Mrs. Elton is totally without.

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:39.541
An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl.

01:06:40.402 --> 01:06:42.612
Infinitely to be preferred by any
man of sense and taste

01:06:42.696 --> 01:06:44.133
to such a woman as Mrs. Elton.

01:06:44.483 --> 01:06:47.954
Come, Miss Woodhouse!. Miss Otway, Miss Smith!.
What are you doing?.

01:06:48.144 --> 01:06:49.915
Emma, set your companions the example.

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:50.705
I'm ready.

01:06:51.015 --> 01:06:52.196
Who will you dance with?.

01:06:53.046 --> 01:06:55.037
With you, if you would ask me.

01:06:56.187 --> 01:06:57.177
Will you?.

01:06:57.307 --> 01:07:01.379
Indeed I will!. I have seen how well you dance now.

01:07:01.489 --> 01:07:04.470
And we're not so much brother and sister
as to make it improper.

01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:05.960
Brother and sister?.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.791
No, indeed!.

01:07:25.788 --> 01:07:27.620
No, no, I don't think him old at all.

01:07:27.698 --> 01:07:30.639
When you talk to him, he seems quite different.

01:07:30.729 --> 01:07:32.857
But I was very surprised at first.

01:07:41.602 --> 01:07:42.371
Go on, then!.

01:07:47.284 --> 01:07:48.915
Oh, no, you are not to think that!.

01:07:49.925 --> 01:07:53.187
Pretty lady, pretty lady, give us a penny, please!.

01:07:53.266 --> 01:07:54.851
Please, pretty lady, only a penny!.

01:07:55.808 --> 01:07:56.741
Please!.

01:07:56.818 --> 01:07:57.468
Come, Harriet!.

01:08:00.039 --> 01:08:01.002
Oh, no!.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.001
What the devil do you do here?.

01:08:06.221 --> 01:08:08.848
Stand away from that lady!. Go on!.

01:08:14.174 --> 01:08:17.404
The most extraordinary good fortune,
I happened to come at that moment.

01:08:17.645 --> 01:08:20.305
I was on my way to return a pair
of scissors to Miss Bates.

01:08:20.386 --> 01:08:22.305
God knows what might have happened if I hadn't.!.

01:08:22.395 --> 01:08:27.319
It does seem like providence, or something
out of a romance full of brigands and outlaws.

01:08:27.398 --> 01:08:30.122
But for this to happen in Highbury!.

01:08:31.059 --> 01:08:33.700
How can I ever thank you enough, Mr. Churchill?.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.812
I'm... happy to have been of service, Miss Smith.

01:09:12.953 --> 01:09:16.335
"Mr. Knightley invites you to taste his strawberries,

01:09:16.404 --> 01:09:18.645
which are ripening fast".

01:09:18.736 --> 01:09:21.537
Quite delightful, Knightley!.

01:09:21.767 --> 01:09:25.608
Everything simple, natural, just as I like it.

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:28.549
No form or parade.

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:30.819
We shall be just like gypsies.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.921
Well, not in every respect, I trust.

01:09:33.481 --> 01:09:35.912
Oh!, I wish we had come on a donkey...

01:09:35.992 --> 01:09:40.073
Miss Bates and I, with my "caro sposo"
walking by...

01:09:40.162 --> 01:09:43.024
Nothing could be more natural than that, I suppose.

01:09:43.274 --> 01:09:45.135
Some might consider it so, madam.

01:09:45.995 --> 01:09:49.305
But Knightley, you should have left it to me.

01:09:49.386 --> 01:09:51.337
The invitations, everything.

01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:55.428
I should have been glad to be lady patroness.
It would have been no trouble to me.

01:09:55.518 --> 01:09:56.789
Perhaps not.

01:09:56.949 --> 01:09:59.324
But there is only one woman
I could ever allow

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.570
to invite what guests she pleased to Donwell.

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.091
Mrs. Weston... I suppose.

01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:06.572
No, Mrs. Knightley!.

01:10:08.283 --> 01:10:11.694
And until she is in being, I will
manage such matters myself.

01:10:18.536 --> 01:10:20.537
Well... here we are!.

01:10:21.257 --> 01:10:22.418
You're all very welcome..

01:10:22.528 --> 01:10:26.199
Oh!. The finest fruit in England!.

01:10:27.019 --> 01:10:30.230
I believe they're everybody's
favorite, always wholesome.

01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:32.961
How delightful to gather for oneself.

01:10:33.121 --> 01:10:35.282
The only way of really enjoying them.

01:10:35.372 --> 01:10:38.103
With one's basket over one's arm.

01:10:38.383 --> 01:10:41.064
So simple and natural.

01:10:41.724 --> 01:10:44.115
I fancy myself as a sort of
shepherdess, you know.

01:10:44.385 --> 01:10:46.516
Oh!, are you fond of sheep, then, Mrs. Elton?.

01:10:48.166 --> 01:10:50.207
I thought Mr. Churchill was to be with us today.

01:10:50.577 --> 01:10:52.175
He hoped to ride over from Richmond.

01:10:52.258 --> 01:10:54.015
He should have been here by now.

01:10:54.088 --> 01:10:57.758
I must confess, I am a little anxious.
I have fears of his horse.

01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:01.381
More likely Mrs. Churchill has produce
some new symptom to keep him.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:05.162
Oh, look!. Poor Jane Fairfax!.

01:11:05.782 --> 01:11:07.888
How can she bear it?.

01:11:07.993 --> 01:11:10.742
Now I really will not take "no" for an answer, Jane.

01:11:10.814 --> 01:11:12.544
This is a friend of Mrs. Bragge's.

01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:16.946
A very superior situation, with only two daughters,
and very close to Maple Grove.

01:11:17.056 --> 01:11:19.613
Say the word, Jane, I shall
write this very day.

01:11:19.697 --> 01:11:21.681
I beg you would excuse me, Mrs. Elton.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.401
Miss Fairfax, are you quite well?.
Is there anything I can do?.

01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:32.822
This heat really is most oppressive.

01:11:33.062 --> 01:11:34.262
Will you walk into the house with me?.

01:11:34.662 --> 01:11:35.933
Miss Woodhouse, I must go home.

01:11:36.433 --> 01:11:40.544
I am quite well,but I think I must...
make sure my grandmother lacks nothing.

01:11:41.134 --> 01:11:43.445
Will you be so kind as to say
that when I am missed?.

01:11:43.595 --> 01:11:46.676
Yes!, but let me order our carriage for you.
It can be here in five minutes.

01:11:46.756 --> 01:11:47.757
No, please!.

01:11:48.147 --> 01:11:51.148
The greatest kindness you could do me is to...
let me have my own way.

01:11:51.228 --> 01:11:53.319
And only say I'm gone when it's necessary.

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:54.899
Will you do that?.

01:11:54.999 --> 01:11:57.420
Yes, of course, if you wish it.

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.712
Thank you.

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:02.772
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of being sometimes alone!.

01:12:36.073 --> 01:12:38.814
Ah!. Ah, there you are, my dear!.

01:12:38.908 --> 01:12:41.942
I hope you're being careful as to the drafts.

01:12:42.035 --> 01:12:45.046
You see, I am well here with a small fire.,

01:12:45.126 --> 01:12:47.881
but this can be a very drafty house.

01:12:53.739 --> 01:12:56.200
Ah... Miss Woodhouse!.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.201
Where is everybody?.

01:12:58.511 --> 01:13:00.562
I suppose there was hardly
much point in my coming.

01:13:01.112 --> 01:13:02.872
The party will be breaking up, I suppose.

01:13:03.553 --> 01:13:05.813
I met one as I came in.

01:13:06.104 --> 01:13:08.364
Madness in such weather!. Absolute madness!.

01:13:08.464 --> 01:13:09.285
What delayed you?.

01:13:09.775 --> 01:13:12.426
Oh, Mrs. Churchill, one of her nervous seizures.

01:13:12.516 --> 01:13:14.096
This heat is really too much!.

01:13:14.246 --> 01:13:16.517
You will be cooler if you stand still.

01:13:16.617 --> 01:13:18.608
Yes, thank you, but I must go back again.

01:13:18.698 --> 01:13:22.789
I could very ill be spared, but, such a
point was made of my coming!.

01:13:22.889 --> 01:13:25.290
But you will come with us tomorrow to Box Hill?.

01:13:25.370 --> 01:13:29.121
No. It will not be worthwhile.
If I come, I shall be cross.

01:13:29.642 --> 01:13:30.942
Then, pray stay at Richmond.

01:13:31.142 --> 01:13:33.913
If I do, I shall be crosser still.
You all there without me!.

01:13:34.363 --> 01:13:36.894
These are difficulties
you must settle for yourself.

01:13:36.984 --> 01:13:39.355
Choose your own degree of crossness.

01:13:41.826 --> 01:13:45.887
You're quite right. I'm an absolute bear today.

01:13:45.977 --> 01:13:47.458
I will leave you.

01:13:47.958 --> 01:13:51.034
If I come to Box Hill, I promise to be in good temper.

01:13:52.109 --> 01:13:53.233
Good day!.

01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:29.312
So this is Box Hill!.

01:14:30.582 --> 01:14:32.846
Well, I am very glad to see it.

01:14:47.658 --> 01:14:50.869
Let me say at once how much I'm obliged to you
for telling me to come today.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.171
Miss Woodhouse found me very cross
and fatigued yesterday.

01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:56.271
And almost determined to go away forever.

01:14:56.411 --> 01:14:57.112
Forever?.

01:14:57.212 --> 01:15:00.703
Well, for awhile... and at least as far as Switzerland.

01:15:01.223 --> 01:15:03.518
But thanks to her, you see, here I am.

01:15:03.594 --> 01:15:05.523
I am very glad she did persuade you.

01:15:06.405 --> 01:15:07.585
Thank you, Miss Smith.

01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:11.586
Oh!, we passed Dr. Perry on our way here on horseback.

01:15:12.167 --> 01:15:15.158
What happened to Perry's plan
to set up a carriage, Father?.

01:15:15.248 --> 01:15:17.008
I heard of no such plan.

01:15:17.549 --> 01:15:19.119
Yes, you wrote of it in a letter!.

01:15:19.679 --> 01:15:22.580
No, not I... I never heard of it.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.701
Lord, how strange!.

01:15:25.231 --> 01:15:26.811
Then I suppose...

01:15:30.393 --> 01:15:32.694
Then I suppose I must have dreamt it.

01:15:34.664 --> 01:15:38.806
Come, Miss Woodhouse!. Come, Miss Smith!.
Best foot forward!.

01:15:40.146 --> 01:15:42.198
Yes, as I was saying, we came in a party,

01:15:42.277 --> 01:15:44.505
and Captain Fitzwilloughby was of our party.

01:15:44.578 --> 01:15:47.104
I remember that and such a day we had.
And then...

01:15:47.181 --> 01:15:48.546
I do not know what happened.

01:15:48.619 --> 01:15:53.171
Captain Fitzwilloughby was called away
by his colonel, and then it came on to rain...

01:15:54.291 --> 01:15:55.582
Are you going to play anagrams?.

01:15:55.672 --> 01:15:57.732
I'm never any good at them.

01:15:57.832 --> 01:16:01.804
But Miss Fairfax is to be a governess,
so she can teach us all.

01:16:01.904 --> 01:16:03.744
What do you think this could be, Miss Fairfax?.

01:16:10.847 --> 01:16:13.368
Oh!. May I try?.

01:16:18.269 --> 01:16:19.897
B...

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.501
U...

01:16:24.621 --> 01:16:25.002
L...

01:16:27.172 --> 01:16:29.893
No. I can't do it at all.

01:16:29.993 --> 01:16:31.544
May I?.

01:16:33.104 --> 01:16:34.015
Oh, please!.

01:16:42.027 --> 01:16:45.158
"Blunder!". Oh!, why could I not see it?.

01:16:45.389 --> 01:16:47.599
Here's one for you, Miss Woodhouse.

01:16:54.222 --> 01:16:56.272
For shame. Here!. Take it, I don't want it!.

01:16:56.352 --> 01:16:56.802
Shall I give it to her?.

01:16:56.837 --> 01:16:57.893
No, you mustn't!.

01:16:57.973 --> 01:17:00.254
Miss Fairfax... would you care
to apply yourself to this?.

01:17:04.385 --> 01:17:05.682
I didn't know...

01:17:08.526 --> 01:17:10.288
I didn't know proper names were allowed.

01:17:12.578 --> 01:17:16.009
Come!... What do you all do there?. Are you not hungry?.

01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:20.731
Thank you.

01:17:22.311 --> 01:17:23.432
May I ask what the joke was,

01:17:23.522 --> 01:17:27.723
that caused so much entertainment on one side,
and so much distress on the other?.

01:17:27.853 --> 01:17:30.424
Nothing. It was a silly
private joke, that's all.

01:17:30.814 --> 01:17:31.564
Was it?.

01:17:32.505 --> 01:17:36.226
Emma, are you sure you understand the
degree of acquaintance between those two?.

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:39.583
Between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax?.

01:17:39.937 --> 01:17:41.548
Could you really think that?.

01:17:41.638 --> 01:17:44.697
But there is nothing between them...
no attachment at all.

01:17:44.779 --> 01:17:47.130
That is, I presume there is none on her side...

01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:49.177
but I know there is nothing on his.

01:17:56.163 --> 01:17:59.654
How strange that Mr. Frank Churchill
should dream of Mr. Perry's carriage,

01:17:59.754 --> 01:18:03.921
for it was quite a secret... nobody knew of it
but ourselves and Jane,

01:18:03.995 --> 01:18:06.406
and now for Mr. Frank Churchill to dream about it!.

01:18:06.506 --> 01:18:07.917
Dreams are extraordinary things!.

01:18:08.197 --> 01:18:10.348
You are in much better spirits today.

01:18:10.428 --> 01:18:12.094
That is because I am under your command.

01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:13.559
Can't you command yourself?.

01:18:13.659 --> 01:18:16.750
I don't believe I can. I'm completely under your influence.

01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:17.500
Since when?.

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:19.301
Since I saw you first in March.

01:18:19.541 --> 01:18:22.022
I think you should lower your voice.
No one else is speaking.

01:18:22.102 --> 01:18:23.972
I'm saying nothing to be ashamed of.

01:18:24.522 --> 01:18:26.510
I saw you first in March!.

01:18:26.593 --> 01:18:28.523
Let everybody hear, Mickleham to Dorking!.

01:18:28.594 --> 01:18:31.895
I saw Miss Emma Woodhouse first in March!.

01:18:32.115 --> 01:18:36.026
There. Now... we are a very dull party,
and that will not do.

01:18:36.107 --> 01:18:40.770
I'm ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say she desires
to know what you are all thinking.

01:18:40.848 --> 01:18:44.437
Is Miss Woodhouse sure she would like to hear
what we're all thinking?.

01:18:44.509 --> 01:18:45.728
No, upon no account!.

01:18:45.801 --> 01:18:48.851
It is the very last thing
I would stand the brunt of just now.

01:18:49.041 --> 01:18:51.372
Ordered?. By Miss Woodhouse, indeed!.

01:18:52.042 --> 01:18:57.064
Well, I was never in any circle before where
I was ordered or required to do anything...

01:18:57.194 --> 01:19:00.765
or one where young ladies ordered
married women to do this or that.

01:19:00.865 --> 01:19:03.496
I think it is only a kind of joke, Augusta.

01:19:03.586 --> 01:19:04.816
Joke, indeed!.

01:19:05.116 --> 01:19:07.937
Some people don't seem to understand proper decorum.

01:19:08.047 --> 01:19:11.007
In that case, Miss Woodhouse orders me to say

01:19:11.078 --> 01:19:14.460
that she requires something entertaining
from each of you.

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:18.312
It can be one very clever thing,
or two moderately clever things,

01:19:18.391 --> 01:19:21.290
or three very dull things indeed.

01:19:21.372 --> 01:19:22.552
More of her orders?.

01:19:22.722 --> 01:19:24.193
Intolerable!.

01:19:26.234 --> 01:19:28.690
Well, I am happy to oblige, Miss Woodhouse.

01:19:29.145 --> 01:19:32.636
"Three very dull things indeed..." That will just do for me.

01:19:32.936 --> 01:19:36.857
I shall be sure to say three very dull things
as soon as ever I open my mouth, shan't I?.

01:19:37.237 --> 01:19:38.838
Do not you all think I shall?.

01:19:38.938 --> 01:19:41.389
But there may be a difficulty
for you, Miss Bates!.

01:19:41.719 --> 01:19:44.520
You'll be limited as to number...
Only three at once.

01:19:47.501 --> 01:19:50.022
Ah... yes, to be sure!.

01:19:53.673 --> 01:19:57.214
I see what she means, and I will try to hold my tongue.

01:19:59.305 --> 01:20:01.576
I must make myself very disagreeable,

01:20:01.656 --> 01:20:04.347
or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend.

01:20:07.698 --> 01:20:10.329
Shall we walk Augusta?.

01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:15.357
Happy couple!.

01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:17.194
How well they suit each other!.

01:20:17.311 --> 01:20:19.132
Very lucky, marrying as they did,

01:20:19.202 --> 01:20:22.201
on such a short acquaintance
formed in a public place.

01:20:22.313 --> 01:20:25.374
How many a man has committed himself
on a short acquaintance,

01:20:25.454 --> 01:20:27.284
and regretted it the rest of his life?.

01:20:28.465 --> 01:20:30.496
These things do occur, undoubtedly.

01:20:31.266 --> 01:20:32.836
But only the weakest character will allow

01:20:32.916 --> 01:20:35.917
such an unfortunate acquaintance
to be an oppressión forever.

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:53.203
Emma!...

01:20:54.424 --> 01:20:56.464
How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates?.

01:20:57.225 --> 01:21:00.216
So insolent in your wit to a woman
of her age and of her situation?.

01:21:00.306 --> 01:21:02.266
I couldn't help myself!.

01:21:02.366 --> 01:21:05.608
She is a good creature, but ridiculous. You must allow.

01:21:06.458 --> 01:21:08.088
I daresay she didn't understand me.

01:21:08.178 --> 01:21:11.810
I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning.

01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:15.401
She has talked of it since with more candor
and generosity than she got from you!.

01:21:16.351 --> 01:21:20.173
When you were a little girl, it was an
honor for you to be noticed by Miss Bates.

01:21:20.283 --> 01:21:21.513
Now it's the other way round.

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:25.524
She is poor. She has sunk from the comfort
she was born to.

01:21:26.245 --> 01:21:27.905
And you chose to humble her?.

01:21:28.685 --> 01:21:31.056
To laugh at her, openly, in company?.

01:21:33.527 --> 01:21:38.349
Her situation should secure your compassión...
not your ridicule.

01:21:47.682 --> 01:21:49.233
It was badly done, Emma!.

01:21:50.083 --> 01:21:51.623
Badly done indeed!.

01:22:08.639 --> 01:22:12.252
It is so very good of you!. Always so good!.

01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:15.221
Jane is not well... she has a fearful headache.

01:22:15.301 --> 01:22:17.768
It came upon her at Box Hill
and has got worse.

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:21.394
She asks me to make her apologies to you.
She cannot leave her bed.

01:22:21.874 --> 01:22:27.466
But even so, she has determined
to accept the post with Mrs. Smallridge.

01:22:27.546 --> 01:22:30.997
She would write today, and so we are to lose her.

01:22:33.568 --> 01:22:37.389
But it is very good of you to come
Miss Woodhouse!. So very good!.

01:22:37.509 --> 01:22:39.220
You are always very good.

01:22:49.713 --> 01:22:51.444
Ah!, there you are, my dear..

01:22:54.245 --> 01:22:55.715
I wouldn't leave without seeing you.

01:22:56.716 --> 01:22:59.276
I'm going to London, to spend a few
days with John and Isabella.

01:23:00.637 --> 01:23:05.199
Have you anything to send or say,
besides the love which no one carries?.

01:23:06.139 --> 01:23:07.926
No, nothing!.

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.601
Isn't this rather a sudden scheme?.

01:23:11.941 --> 01:23:14.922
Yes... Or rather...

01:23:16.392 --> 01:23:18.543
I have been thinking of it for some little time.

01:23:19.663 --> 01:23:24.075
Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates,
Mr. Knightley.

01:23:24.365 --> 01:23:26.496
She's always so attentive to them!.

01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:40.363
I must go.

01:23:50.704 --> 01:23:53.795
I do not like it Emma, when people go away.

01:23:54.085 --> 01:23:57.386
I know they must do sometimes,
but I do not like it.

01:23:57.877 --> 01:23:59.797
Nor I.

01:24:03.779 --> 01:24:06.179
I have made up my mind
that I shall never marry.

01:24:06.279 --> 01:24:08.910
Harriet, what makes you say this?.

01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:11.529
I hope it's not in compliment to Mr. Elton.

01:24:11.601 --> 01:24:13.092
Oh, no!.

01:24:13.492 --> 01:24:18.334
There is a person I admire.
But he is not someone I could ever...

01:24:18.434 --> 01:24:21.675
I owe so much to him!. And how could
anyone not admire him?.

01:24:21.825 --> 01:24:24.246
And this dates from the service he rendered you?.

01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:26.236
Oh, yes!.

01:24:26.336 --> 01:24:29.594
When I saw him coming, how noble he looked...

01:24:29.727 --> 01:24:34.169
What a change!... from perfect misery to perfect happiness.

01:24:34.509 --> 01:24:36.490
But I mustn't think of him, must I?.

01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:39.511
Well, stranger things have...

01:24:39.601 --> 01:24:40.601
No!.

01:24:41.351 --> 01:24:45.433
Dear Harriet, you mustn't let yourself be
influenced, especially by me.

01:24:45.813 --> 01:24:48.524
From now on, I am determined
to lead a better life.

01:24:52.115 --> 01:24:55.786
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, what can I say?.

01:24:56.066 --> 01:24:57.574
We have such kind neighbours!.

01:24:57.917 --> 01:25:03.019
But Jane has told me to say that she still
feels quite unequal to receiving anybody.

01:25:03.609 --> 01:25:06.124
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, her spirits are quite overcome!.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.481
She has not left her room
for three days.

01:25:25.657 --> 01:25:29.998
"Father... It is with the deepest sorrow
that I must inform you"

01:25:30.078 --> 01:25:32.909
"of the death of my aunt, Mrs. Churchill".

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:36.990
"She was carried off by a seizure
early on Tuesday morning".

01:25:37.581 --> 01:25:39.721
"I was glad to be with her at the last".

01:25:40.662 --> 01:25:44.473
"As to the future, that seems at present uncertain".

01:25:44.903 --> 01:25:47.134
"I shall visit you again as soon as I can".

01:25:49.165 --> 01:25:53.236
Well, I am heartily sorry for almost everything
I said and thought about Mrs. Churchill.

01:25:53.326 --> 01:25:57.858
Yes, poor lady!. Very sad.
So ill, and everyone vexed with her.

01:25:58.068 --> 01:26:00.919
Mmm. Two interesting questions remain:

01:26:01.019 --> 01:26:04.630
Will she have left Mr. Frank Churchill
enough money to make him independent?.

01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:08.261
And given that, who will he marry
now he is free to make his own choice?.

01:26:08.361 --> 01:26:12.613
I gather that the stepfather is a very easygoing man,
and quite unlike his wife.

01:26:12.863 --> 01:26:15.974
Yes!. Who will he marry, now he has his choice?.

01:26:16.064 --> 01:26:19.525
Harriet, I have reformed. My lips are sealed.

01:26:22.666 --> 01:26:27.118
Miss Woodhouse?... Ah, Miss Woodhouse!.

01:26:27.968 --> 01:26:32.339
Can you come to Randalls at any time
this morning?. Mrs. Weston wants to see you.

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:34.840
Can you come?.

01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:38.071
Yes, of course. This moment, if you please.

01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:40.242
But what is the matter?. Is she ill?.

01:26:40.322 --> 01:26:44.564
No, no, no, no!. It's something else. Be patient.
It will all come out soon enough.

01:26:44.644 --> 01:26:46.814
Mrs. Weston will break it to you
better than I can.

01:26:46.894 --> 01:26:50.085
Good God, what?. Something has happened to Isabella?.
To the children?.

01:26:50.165 --> 01:26:51.366
No, indeed!.

01:26:51.446 --> 01:26:54.537
It's nothing to do with anyone by the name of Knightley.

01:26:54.797 --> 01:26:58.959
It, it is to do with... Come, walk with me.

01:26:59.609 --> 01:27:02.200
Mrs. Weston will not be easy
until she has seen you.

01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:05.919
What is it, my dear friend?. Tell me at once.

01:27:05.991 --> 01:27:08.847
It will do you good to speak of your distress.

01:27:08.952 --> 01:27:13.453
I will tell you, Emma... Frank was here this morning.

01:27:13.543 --> 01:27:16.274
He came to speak to his father
on a subject...

01:27:17.935 --> 01:27:19.596
to announce an attachment.

01:27:20.816 --> 01:27:25.017
Emma... Frank is engaged to Jane Fairfax.

01:27:25.107 --> 01:27:29.239
He has been secretly engaged to her since
October last, when they met at Weymouth.

01:27:30.099 --> 01:27:31.870
It was he who sent the piano.

01:27:33.210 --> 01:27:37.092
Emma, he was engaged to Jane Fairfax
before he ever came here!.

01:27:39.822 --> 01:27:40.913
"What is the matter?".

01:27:42.948 --> 01:27:45.805
"I have no doubt at all, it was an offering of love".

01:27:46.025 --> 01:27:47.335
"An offering of love?".

01:27:47.825 --> 01:27:51.767
"You have convinced me. I believe it was".

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:55.048
It seems the engagement had to be secret.

01:27:56.328 --> 01:27:59.359
He deceived us because he feared
his aunt's disapproval.

01:28:00.209 --> 01:28:02.425
Or feared she would disinherit him.

01:28:04.091 --> 01:28:05.951
It has hurt me, Emma, very much.

01:28:06.962 --> 01:28:08.732
It has hurt his father, too.

01:28:09.823 --> 01:28:12.664
Some part of his conduct we cannot excuse.

01:28:16.005 --> 01:28:18.516
Let me relieve you on that score at least.

01:28:19.256 --> 01:28:22.967
There was a time, I confess, when I liked him.

01:28:23.968 --> 01:28:25.988
When I liked him very much.

01:28:26.849 --> 01:28:31.600
And how it came to cease, I do not know.
But you may believe me, I am safe.

01:28:33.061 --> 01:28:36.192
But his behavior to her, and to us all!.

01:28:36.472 --> 01:28:38.863
What hypocrisy, what deceit!.

01:28:39.403 --> 01:28:41.484
Here we have been, all winter and spring!,

01:28:41.564 --> 01:28:44.114
fancying ourselves on an equal
footing of truth and honor!,

01:28:44.195 --> 01:28:45.865
and all this time, he has!...

01:28:46.325 --> 01:28:48.326
Oh, Lord!, How shall I break it to Harriet?.

01:28:48.996 --> 01:28:50.187
Harriet?.

01:28:50.557 --> 01:28:51.547
Me?.

01:28:51.647 --> 01:28:55.969
Why should you think it would affect me?.
You don't think I care for Mr. Churchill!.

01:28:56.059 --> 01:28:58.941
But, Harriet, didn't you say so yourself?.

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:03.061
Considering the service he rendered you,
it was extremely natural.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:06.732
No!. Oh, you have misunderstood me!.

01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:09.773
I meant a much more precious circumstance.

01:29:10.504 --> 01:29:13.944
I meant Mr. Knightley... when he asked me to dance.

01:29:14.045 --> 01:29:15.990
Oh, good God!.

01:29:16.956 --> 01:29:19.647
Oh, Harriet!, if I had known
you meant Mr. Knightley

01:29:19.727 --> 01:29:22.198
I should never in a million years, have encouraged you.

01:29:22.278 --> 01:29:26.902
Why should you not?. You said that more wonderful
things had happened

01:29:26.979 --> 01:29:28.830
And why should it not be so?.

01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:31.541
And you believe he returns your affection?.

01:29:32.591 --> 01:29:35.362
Yes, I must say that I do!.

01:29:35.732 --> 01:29:37.703
But has he said anything directly?.

01:29:38.073 --> 01:29:42.004
No... but he has talked to me
in a very particular way.

01:29:42.144 --> 01:29:45.846
He seemed to be asking whether my affections were engaged.

01:29:45.946 --> 01:29:48.053
He was not thinking of Mr. Martin?.

01:29:48.136 --> 01:29:50.659
Mr. Martin!. No, indeed!.

01:29:51.367 --> 01:29:54.208
I hope I know better now
than to care for Mr. Martin.

01:29:54.979 --> 01:29:59.280
I would never have thought of Mr. Knightley,
you know had you not encouraged me.

01:29:59.370 --> 01:30:01.603
Oh, God, that I'd never met her!.

01:30:40.054 --> 01:30:41.275
No!.

01:30:44.186 --> 01:30:45.896
Did you say anything, my dear?.

01:30:46.997 --> 01:30:48.837
Nothing, Papa.

01:30:53.769 --> 01:30:56.560
"You and I shall never be enemies".

01:30:57.410 --> 01:31:00.461
"Never be enemies, never be enemies..."

01:31:04.272 --> 01:31:05.633
"I've seen how well you dance now".

01:31:05.733 --> 01:31:08.594
"And we are not so much brother and sister
as to make it improper".

01:31:08.674 --> 01:31:10.264
"Brother and sister?".

01:31:10.365 --> 01:31:12.115
"No, indeed!".

01:31:14.556 --> 01:31:18.827
"Her situation should secure your compassión...
not your ridicule".

01:31:21.328 --> 01:31:22.799
"It was badly done, Emma!".

01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:25.390
"Badly done, indeed!".

01:31:32.822 --> 01:31:34.113
I love him!.

01:31:34.973 --> 01:31:37.014
I've always loved him.

01:31:38.054 --> 01:31:39.785
Oh!, what have I done?.

01:32:23.099 --> 01:32:25.390
I did not expect to see you so soon.

01:32:25.470 --> 01:32:27.053
I rode back this morning.

01:32:27.131 --> 01:32:28.621
You must have had a wet ride.

01:32:28.701 --> 01:32:29.669
Yes!.

01:32:31.152 --> 01:32:32.883
I have some news for you.

01:32:33.173 --> 01:32:36.504
I have some news for you. I've heard it.

01:32:37.224 --> 01:32:40.996
I... had a letter from Mr. Weston, and came back directly.

01:32:41.686 --> 01:32:46.838
You were probably less surprised than anyone,
you had your suspicions.

01:32:46.918 --> 01:32:48.768
I wish I had attended to them...

01:32:49.849 --> 01:32:52.429
But I seem to have been doomed to blindness.

01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:55.911
My dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.

01:32:57.451 --> 01:32:59.181
I cannot tell you what I feel.

01:33:01.443 --> 01:33:03.463
Abominable scoundrel!.

01:33:03.843 --> 01:33:05.704
He will soon be gone.

01:33:05.874 --> 01:33:07.625
They will soon be in Yorkshire.

01:33:08.955 --> 01:33:11.546
I feel sorry for her. She deserves a better fate.

01:33:11.896 --> 01:33:14.877
You're very kind, but you are mistaken.

01:33:16.248 --> 01:33:19.349
I have never really been attached to Mr. Churchill.

01:33:20.239 --> 01:33:23.850
I'm sorry if I gave that impressión,
as I am sure I did.

01:33:25.331 --> 01:33:28.052
I have very little to say for my own conduct.

01:33:28.732 --> 01:33:32.417
My vanity was flattered, and I allowed his attentions.

01:33:33.744 --> 01:33:36.354
He never wished to make me
fall in love with him.

01:33:37.005 --> 01:33:40.736
It was a blind to conceal
his real situation.

01:33:41.856 --> 01:33:45.288
He has imposed on me,
but he has not injured me.

01:33:55.061 --> 01:33:59.752
You know, he is a most fortunate man!.
Everything turns out for his good!.

01:34:00.213 --> 01:34:02.784
He meets a young woman at a watering place!,

01:34:02.874 --> 01:34:06.025
gains her affections, she consents to an engagement!.

01:34:06.115 --> 01:34:09.486
He treats her abominably, she bears it like a saint!.

01:34:09.576 --> 01:34:12.537
His aunt is in the way!... His aunt dies!.

01:34:12.617 --> 01:34:17.328
He has used everybody ill, and they are
all delighted to forgive him!.

01:34:17.899 --> 01:34:19.929
He is a most fortunate man, indeed!.

01:34:20.029 --> 01:34:21.994
You speak as if you envied him.

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:24.271
I do envy him, Emma!.

01:34:25.491 --> 01:34:27.812
In one respect, I envy him very much.

01:34:31.913 --> 01:34:34.074
You don't wish to know what that is?.

01:34:38.146 --> 01:34:41.327
You are determined, I see,
to have no curiosity.

01:34:42.607 --> 01:34:46.188
Emma... I must tell you what you will not ask,

01:34:46.268 --> 01:34:47.769
though I may wish it unsaid
the next moment.

01:34:47.969 --> 01:34:51.980
Oh, then don't speak it!. Take a
little time, don't commit yourself.

01:34:56.152 --> 01:34:58.202
I stopped you ungraciously just then.

01:35:00.083 --> 01:35:01.944
Yes, I will hear you!.

01:35:03.644 --> 01:35:06.615
If you wish to tell me
you are contemplating something,

01:35:08.176 --> 01:35:10.467
yes, you may speak to me as a friend.

01:35:10.917 --> 01:35:12.197
As a friend?.

01:35:13.318 --> 01:35:14.648
Emma, that I fear...

01:35:16.829 --> 01:35:20.610
No, I have gone too far for concealment.

01:35:22.221 --> 01:35:26.812
Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?.

01:35:29.013 --> 01:35:30.624
My dearest Emma...

01:35:31.084 --> 01:35:33.335
For dearest you will always be...

01:35:34.265 --> 01:35:38.756
Tell me at once. Say "no" if it is to be said.

01:35:40.157 --> 01:35:42.148
I can't make speeches, Emma.

01:35:43.278 --> 01:35:45.729
If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.

01:35:45.819 --> 01:35:51.631
But you know what I am.
You hear nothing but truth from me.

01:35:52.921 --> 01:35:56.142
I've blamed you. I've lectured you.

01:35:57.284 --> 01:36:00.478
And you have borne it as no other
woman would have borne it.

01:36:01.984 --> 01:36:04.325
Well, bear with the truth I tell you now.

01:36:06.786 --> 01:36:09.577
My manners may not have much
to recommend them but...

01:36:12.988 --> 01:36:14.649
Oh, you understand me!.

01:36:16.289 --> 01:36:19.870
Yes, you understand my feelings,
and will return them if you can.

01:36:20.991 --> 01:36:25.592
I can... I do return them.

01:36:26.583 --> 01:36:28.172
I do love you!.

01:36:28.643 --> 01:36:33.255
I believe I always have thought I didn't
know it until yesterday, I think.

01:36:35.046 --> 01:36:36.676
Then you do consent?.

01:36:36.906 --> 01:36:40.548
I do!... I do!.

01:36:42.548 --> 01:36:43.599
This is so strange!.

01:36:44.849 --> 01:36:49.441
I held you in my arms when you were three weeks old.

01:36:50.671 --> 01:36:53.142
Do you like me as well now
as you did then?.

01:37:16.770 --> 01:37:18.470
Oh, Lord... Harriet!.

01:37:21.642 --> 01:37:23.822
Miss Woodhouse!. I was coming to see you!.

01:37:23.912 --> 01:37:25.363
I was just going to the school!.

01:37:25.443 --> 01:37:27.173
You'll be so angry with me!.

01:37:27.283 --> 01:37:28.814
No, no, quite the opposite!.

01:37:28.904 --> 01:37:31.588
I must tell you now for you'll know soon enough.

01:37:31.665 --> 01:37:35.016
I'm going to be married... to Mr. Robert Martin.

01:37:35.096 --> 01:37:36.707
He came to the school.

01:37:36.787 --> 01:37:40.228
He was so gentlemanlike... And told me
his feelings had never changed.

01:37:40.328 --> 01:37:43.749
That he tried to overcome his love,
but not been able to,

01:37:43.839 --> 01:37:45.864
and Mr. Knightley encouraged him to try again.

01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:49.060
He is so good!. And I found I couldn't say no.

01:37:49.141 --> 01:37:52.902
In fact, I believe I have truly been in love
with dear Robert all the time.

01:37:53.412 --> 01:37:56.664
Oh, Miss Woodhouse!, say you will
forgive me, and think kindly of me.

01:37:56.774 --> 01:37:59.665
Although I understand you will not see me anymore.

01:37:59.775 --> 01:38:04.056
Oh, Harriet!, this is very good news, indeed.

01:38:04.206 --> 01:38:09.768
What are you thinking of, Emma?. No, I do
not think this is a good idea at all.

01:38:11.399 --> 01:38:15.070
Think of poor Isabella. Think of poor Miss Taylor.

01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:18.881
But I love him, Father. And he loves me.

01:38:18.991 --> 01:38:22.873
Yes, that may very well be,
but you'd much better not get married.

01:38:23.023 --> 01:38:24.423
I mean, what would I do...

01:38:25.563 --> 01:38:28.134
if you... went from Hartfield?.

01:38:29.145 --> 01:38:31.595
My dear sir, Emma and I have discussed this,

01:38:31.676 --> 01:38:34.927
and agree there could be no question
of Emma's leaving you.

01:38:35.027 --> 01:38:37.988
And we understand you would be much
happier at Hartfield,

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:40.849
rather than removing to Donwell Abbey.

01:38:40.969 --> 01:38:41.719
Therefore...

01:38:41.829 --> 01:38:46.841
Mr. Knightley has offered to come and live here
as long as... you wish it, Papa.

01:38:46.961 --> 01:38:48.411
Isn't that good of him?.

01:38:48.511 --> 01:38:50.872
But we see him every day as it is.

01:38:52.573 --> 01:38:55.204
Why can we not go on as we did before?.

01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:59.175
We see him every day
but we are alone at night.

01:39:02.116 --> 01:39:06.848
Papa, I have heard that the chicken thieves
have returned to the neighbourhood.

01:39:06.938 --> 01:39:11.659
Not two nights ago they broke into Mrs. Weston's
poultry house and stole her turkeys.

01:39:11.849 --> 01:39:13.210
Oh!.

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:16.391
Would you not be happier knowing
Mr. Knightley were in the house?.

01:39:18.181 --> 01:39:20.532
Why!... Why, yes, Emma!.

01:39:20.692 --> 01:39:22.793
I believe I would.

01:39:48.822 --> 01:39:50.462
Best harvest, sir!.

01:39:59.496 --> 01:40:02.867
Well, I declare, Knightley invited his tenants!.

01:40:03.017 --> 01:40:05.968
Are we to sit down with hobbledehoys?.

01:40:06.818 --> 01:40:09.589
These great men can be eccentric, Augusta my love.

01:40:09.624 --> 01:40:12.360
And I believe harvest suppers are traditional.

01:40:14.171 --> 01:40:16.902
In my opinion, eccentricity can go too far.

01:40:21.053 --> 01:40:23.204
¡Knightley!...

01:40:28.716 --> 01:40:32.167
Ladies and gentleman!... Friends!...

01:40:33.197 --> 01:40:36.628
We have been blessed this year again with a
good harvest.

01:40:38.019 --> 01:40:40.059
I have been blessed in another way too.

01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:46.412
By next harvest... I shall be living at Hartfield,

01:40:47.402 --> 01:40:50.703
although I assure you all I shall be
farming my estate,

01:40:51.443 --> 01:40:53.034
and looking after you all.

01:40:54.684 --> 01:40:56.515
There will be stability...

01:40:57.946 --> 01:41:01.197
There will be... continuation...

01:41:02.487 --> 01:41:04.518
Though my life is to change.

01:41:06.398 --> 01:41:10.340
I ask you all to drink the healt of the lady

01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:14.071
who has made me the happiest men in the earth.

01:41:15.462 --> 01:41:17.202
Miss Emma Woodhouse!.

01:41:18.913 --> 01:41:21.254
Miss Emma Woodhouse!.

01:41:21.454 --> 01:41:23.404
Ah!... Mr. Knightley!.

01:41:24.725 --> 01:41:26.565
Mr. Knightley!.

01:41:57.406 --> 01:42:01.807
Miss Woodhouse, may I have the honour of
presenting Mr. Robert Martin?.

01:42:06.459 --> 01:42:07.549
Delighted, ma'am.

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.220
And so am I.

01:42:12.401 --> 01:42:16.773
I hope you will both very happy and that
you will come and visit us soon at Hartfield,

01:42:16.863 --> 01:42:19.553
with your sister, of course, and Miss Smith.

01:42:21.604 --> 01:42:23.275
Did you see that, Mr. E?.

01:42:25.135 --> 01:42:29.747
Well, I suppose she always meant to
catch Knightley, if she could.

01:42:30.217 --> 01:42:32.818
I hope her pride will be contented now.

01:42:33.108 --> 01:42:35.359
Oh, Emma!... Such happiness!.

01:42:35.809 --> 01:42:36.194
Congratulations, Emma!.

01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:39.880
I know you think the good fortune is all on my side.

01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:42.181
I?... Not at all, not at all!.

01:42:42.271 --> 01:42:45.022
You needn't deny it, for once I agree with you.

01:43:04.549 --> 01:43:05.609
Excuse me please.

01:43:09.351 --> 01:43:10.411
Isn't she lovely?.

01:43:12.532 --> 01:43:15.763
Did you ever see such a skin?. Such smoothness?.

01:43:16.343 --> 01:43:18.414
I have always admired her complexion,

01:43:18.504 --> 01:43:22.365
though I remember a time when you found
fault with her for being too pale.

01:43:22.955 --> 01:43:24.776
What an impudent dog I am!.

01:43:25.136 --> 01:43:26.837
Can you forgive me, Miss Woodhouse?.

01:43:27.127 --> 01:43:29.798
If she can forgive you, so can I, I suppose.

01:43:29.888 --> 01:43:33.459
Oh!, she does forgive me. She's a complete ángel!.

01:43:35.319 --> 01:43:39.561
Look at her!. Observe the turn of her throat.

01:43:41.121 --> 01:43:44.833
You'll be glad to hear my uncle Churchill
means to giver her all my aunt's jewels.

01:43:46.003 --> 01:43:48.384
Won't they look beautiful against the skin?.

01:43:48.514 --> 01:43:49.984
Very beautiful.

01:43:50.615 --> 01:43:54.606
She hears us, she hears us. I see it in her cheek.

01:43:54.906 --> 01:43:58.917
She pretends to listen to the others,
but she can attend to nothing else.

01:44:21.555 --> 01:44:23.066
Will you dance with me, Emma?.

01:44:25.056 --> 01:44:27.987
You and I are not so much brother and sister
as make it improper.

01:44:28.097 --> 01:44:29.388
Brother and sister?.

01:44:29.618 --> 01:44:31.199
No, indeed!.
