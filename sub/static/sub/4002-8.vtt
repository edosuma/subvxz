11:36.875 --> 11:40.625
ALWAYS A FIRST GOOD STEP,
RIGHT?

11:40.625 --> 11:42.542
MOVE A LITTLE CLOSER?

11:42.542 --> 11:44.208
TONIGHT IS JUST ABOUT WATCHING,
LEARNING HIS ROUTINE--

11:44.208 --> 11:46.000
WHERE DOES HE GO,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.250
WHEN DOES HE GO, WHAT DOES HE DO
WHEN HE GETS THERE.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.250
OKAY.
LATER, WE'LL MEET HIM.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.208
WE?

11:52.208 --> 11:55.250
YEAH, WE'LL SEE
HOW IT GOES.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.542
RIGHT NOW,
WE DON'T WANT HIM TO NOTICE US.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.208
WE DON'T WANT ANYONE
TO NOTICE US.

11:59.208 --> 12:02.125
CAMERAS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

12:02.125 --> 12:05.875
NUMBER ONE RULE OF THE CODE
ISDON'T GET CAUGHT."

12:05.875 --> 12:07.375
CODE?
WHAT CODE?

12:07.375 --> 12:11.041
[thinking]
HOW MUCH DO I TELL HIM?

12:11.041 --> 12:13.333
IT'S JUST A SERIES
OF PRECAUTIONS.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.709
LEARNED WHERE?

12:16.375 --> 12:18.542
COMMON SENSE MOSTLY.

12:18.542 --> 12:20.083
A LITTLE MORE
THAN THAT.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.291
WELL, MY DAD WAS A COP.

12:21.291 --> 12:22.875
RIGHT, RIGHT.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.917
SO HE TAUGHT YOU...
WHAT COPS LOOK FOR
IN AN INVESTIGATION.

12:24.917 --> 12:27.542
OH, AND SO YOU WORK IT BACKWARDS
FROM THERE, RIGHT?

12:27.542 --> 12:29.834
PLUS I SPEND ALL DAY LOOKING
AT OTHER PEOPLE'S MISTAKES.

12:29.834 --> 12:32.083
YOU PICK THINGS UP.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.125
I'M SURE.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.834
(Harry)
AM I FORGETTING SOMETHING,
DEXTER?

12:36.834 --> 12:39.917
WAS THERE ONE FINAL LESSON
WHERE I SAID, "GO NOW,

12:39.917 --> 12:43.333
FAR AND WIDE,
AND PREACH THE CODE, MY SON"?

12:43.333 --> 12:44.625
I DON'T THINK SO.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.125
SO WHEN YOU POPPED ANTON
FOR DRUG POSSESSION,

12:49.125 --> 12:51.250
WAS IT JUST POT,
OR WAS IT COKE OR--

12:51.250 --> 12:52.250
WHAT WAS IT?

12:52.250 --> 12:54.750
UH, POT,
I THINK.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.417
RIGHT.
RIGHT, IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN

12:56.417 --> 12:57.542
ANYTHING TOO SERIOUS,

12:57.542 --> 12:58.625
OR YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE MADE HIM A C.I.

12:58.625 --> 13:00.041
I GUESS.

13:00.041 --> 13:01.625
YOU'RE JUST
FULL OF ANSWERS TODAY.

13:01.625 --> 13:05.250
I-I-I JUST BUSTED GUYS
LIKE HIM EVERY DAY.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.291
I DON'T REMEMBER,

13:07.291 --> 13:08.750
AND IT'S ALL WRITTEN DOWN
SOMEWHERE.

13:08.750 --> 13:11.875
RIGHT.
C.I. FILES.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.041
(Anton)
HELLO?

13:22.041 --> 13:23.875
HEY, LAZY,
HOPE I'M WAKING YOU UP.

13:23.875 --> 13:26.625
HEY, LAZY?
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO BED YET.

13:26.625 --> 13:28.125
LOOK, I NEED
YOUR C.I. NUMBER.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.500
I'M GONNA FILE
A STATUS REPORT.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.625
WHAT'S A C.I. NUMBER?

13:31.625 --> 13:35.125
YOUR ASSIGNED
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT NUMBER.

13:35.125 --> 13:36.625
IT SHOULD BE
ON YOUR PAYCHECKS.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.625
WHAT CHECKS?

13:39.625 --> 13:42.333
HELLO. YOUR PAYCHECKS
FROM THE COUNTY.

13:42.333 --> 13:45.125
HELLO. I DON'T GET
ANY PAYCHECKS.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.834
QUINN ALWAYS PAYS ME
IN CASH.

13:48.083 --> 13:50.500
OH.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.917
OKAY.
I'LL GET IT FROM HIM THEN.

13:57.291 --> 14:00.375
MY CLIENT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE SENT TO COUNTY YESTERDAY.

14:00.375 --> 14:01.959
APPARENTLY HE WAS,
BUT THEN THEY PUT HIM

14:01.959 --> 14:03.834
ON THE NEXT BUS RIGHT BACK HERE
IN THE AFTERNOON.

14:03.834 --> 14:05.709
I'VE BEEN CHASING HIM
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

14:05.709 --> 14:07.875
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
THOSE MIX-UPS.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.041
IS IT A MIX-UP,

14:09.041 --> 14:11.709
OR IS MIGUEL FUCKING
WITH ME?

14:11.709 --> 14:13.500
EVER SINCE I STARTED
LOOKING INTO HIM,

14:13.500 --> 14:15.750
HE'S BEEN GOING OUT OF HIS WAY
TO MAKE MY JOB HARDER.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.458
WELL, YOU KNEW
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

14:17.458 --> 14:19.500
DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T BITCH ABOUT IT.

14:19.500 --> 14:23.500
OH, ANYWAY, I SHOULD
GO SEE MY CLIENT

14:23.500 --> 14:25.875
AND ASK WHAT
PERFECTLY LOGICAL REASON HE HAD

14:25.875 --> 14:27.625
FOR LIGHTING
HIS EX-WIFE'S HOUSE ON FIRE.

14:27.625 --> 14:29.375
OH, I WANTED TO ASK YOU.

14:29.375 --> 14:32.583
ANY CHANCE YOU'D GO
TO A POLICE CHARITY FUNCTION

14:32.583 --> 14:34.500
WITH ME TOMORROW NIGHT?

14:34.500 --> 14:36.208
HMM?

14:36.208 --> 14:37.709
ROOM FULL OF COPS?

14:37.709 --> 14:39.500
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING
MORE FUN.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.875
SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.375
I'M KIDDING.
I'D LOVE TO GO.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.458
OKAY, NEXT ON YOUR LIST,
MR. KING,

14:48.458 --> 14:51.041
SANTIAGO RAMIREZ.

14:51.041 --> 14:53.083
HE NO LONGER WORKS
FOR ME.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.083
THAT DIDN'T END SO WELL.

14:54.083 --> 14:56.125
WHY?
HE WAS RUN OVER.

14:56.125 --> 15:00.542
UH, MARIO ASTORGA.
DIDN'T I TALK TO HIM?

15:00.542 --> 15:02.083
YES,
IF YOU REMEMBER,

15:02.083 --> 15:03.500
HE'S THE ONE
WHO FOUND THE BODY OF THAT MAN.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.834
RIGHT.
SECOND VICTIM.

15:04.834 --> 15:06.625
MARIO'S ONE
OF MY BEST FOREMEN.

15:06.625 --> 15:07.709
SO HE'S A GOOD GUY?

15:08.792 --> 15:10.917
WHAT,
HE'S NOT A GOOD GUY?

15:13.750 --> 15:16.709
HE HAS A TEMPER.
HE GETS VERY ANGRY.

15:16.709 --> 15:19.458
KEEP GOING.

15:19.458 --> 15:21.583
I KNEW HIS FAMILY
BACK IN NICARAGUA.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.333
WE'RE BOTH FROM SAN MARCOS.

15:23.333 --> 15:24.542
BUT MARIO HAD TO LEAVE.

15:24.542 --> 15:25.709
WHY?

15:27.709 --> 15:29.750
THE POLICE WERE LOOKING
FOR HIM.

15:29.750 --> 15:32.250
I HEARD HE KILLED SOMEONE
WITH A KNIFE.

15:35.792 --> 15:36.959
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE I CAN FIND MARIO?

15:36.959 --> 15:39.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE LIVES.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.375
BUT TOMORROW,
HE'LL BE AT BAYSIDE PARK.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.959
YOU SURE?
I MAKE THE SCHEDULE.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.000
(Dexter)
FLEETER PAYS OFF
HIS GAMBLING DEBTS

15:51.000 --> 15:53.083
BY ELIMINATING PEOPLE
FOR HIS BOOKIE.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.750
A SCHOOLTEACHER HERE,
A MOTHER OF TWO THERE.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.208
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SETTLE
THEIR DEBTS.

15:57.208 --> 15:59.083
SENDING A MESSAGE
TO OTHERS--

15:59.083 --> 16:00.500
"PAY UP."

16:00.500 --> 16:02.500
DO I HELP MIGUEL MOVE FORWARD
ON THIS,

16:02.500 --> 16:04.750
OR DO I LISTEN TO HARRY
AND SHUT IT DOWN?

16:04.750 --> 16:05.834
[cell phone buzzes]

16:07.458 --> 16:08.750
HEY, YOU.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.709
YEAH, I JUST HEARD A LOVE SONG
ON THE RADIO

16:11.709 --> 16:13.125
THAT REMINDED ME
OF YOU.

16:13.125 --> 16:14.458
OH, THAT'S SWEET.

16:14.458 --> 16:15.333
AND IT MADE ME
REALLY ANGRY.

16:15.333 --> 16:16.959
OH.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.083
SO HAVE YOU GOTTEN
THE WEDDING BANDS YET?

16:19.083 --> 16:22.000
UM, I'M STILL DOING MY RESEARCH,
BUT I'M ON IT.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.834
[sighs]

16:23.834 --> 16:25.500
I GOTTA GO.

16:32.959 --> 16:36.417
HEY, YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT WEDDING RINGS?

16:36.417 --> 16:38.959
YEAH.

16:38.959 --> 16:40.333
WEDDING RINGS
AND NUCLEAR FISSION ARE

16:40.333 --> 16:41.458
LIKE MY SECRET SPECIALTIES.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.500
THANKS.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.291
YOUR BROTHER'S
KIND OF A DWEEB, HUH?

16:46.291 --> 16:49.208
YOU SAY ANYTHING MORE
ABOUT MY BROTHER,

16:49.208 --> 16:51.667
AND I WILL KICK YOUR FUCKING
NUTS DOWN YOUR THROAT.

16:51.667 --> 16:54.291
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE
ANY SENSE.

16:56.291 --> 16:59.750
SO, HEY, ANTON DOESN'T HAVE
ANY PRIORS,

16:59.750 --> 17:01.000
YOU PAY HIM IN CASH,

17:01.000 --> 17:02.875
AND I CAN'T FIND HIM
IN THE C.I. DATABASE.

17:02.875 --> 17:04.834
SHOULD BE IN THERE.

17:04.834 --> 17:06.000
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?

17:08.041 --> 17:10.083
ANTON IS NOT OFFICIALLY
A C.I.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.083
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:12.083 --> 17:13.625
COME HERE FOR A SECOND.

17:18.417 --> 17:21.959
LOOK, IT WAS JUST EASIER
FOR BOTH OF US.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.083
I NEVER FILED
AN ARREST REPORT ON HIM

17:24.083 --> 17:25.625
SO HE HAS NO POLICE RECORD.

17:25.625 --> 17:26.917
I DID HIM A FAVOR.

17:26.917 --> 17:29.417
PLUS, IT SAVED ME THE HASSLE
OF ALL THAT PAPERWORK.

17:29.417 --> 17:33.709
YOU HAVE GOT
TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME.

17:33.709 --> 17:36.291
WE USED HIM AS BAIT.

17:36.291 --> 17:39.041
HE WAS PUTTING HIS LIFE
AT RISK, AND HE WAS

17:39.041 --> 17:40.959
UNDER NO LEGAL OBLIGATION
TO HELP US.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.542
NO, NO, NO, THERE WAS
JUST NO PAPERWORK, THAT'S ALL.

17:42.542 --> 17:43.792
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT

17:43.792 --> 17:45.333
THAT BECAUSE HE'S NOT
OFFICIALLY A C.I.,

17:45.333 --> 17:47.792
THERE'S NO END DATE TO WHEN
HE'S DONE WORKING FOR US,

17:47.792 --> 17:49.000
SO YOU CAN JUST STRING HIM ALONG
AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.875
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
SO UPSET ABOUT?

17:50.875 --> 17:51.834
WHAT, ARE YOU IN LOVE
WITH THE GUY?

17:53.917 --> 17:56.792
NO, I'M NOT IN LOVE
WITH HIM.

17:56.792 --> 17:58.667
BUT YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH HIM.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.792
JESUS CHRIST,

18:00.792 --> 18:03.000
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND
OF A BONEHEAD MISTAKE THAT IS?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.375
SLEEPING
WITH AN INFORMANT?

18:04.375 --> 18:05.500
I MEAN,
IT'S THAT KIND OF JUDGMENT'LL

18:05.500 --> 18:06.583
SCREW UP YOUR CAREER.

18:06.583 --> 18:07.625
HE'S NOT AN INFORMANT.
YOU JUST SAID IT.

18:07.625 --> 18:08.667
BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.291
EITHER WAY,
IT MAKES YOU LOOK STUPID.

18:10.291 --> 18:12.583
NO, YOU DON'T GET
TO LECTURE ME, ASSHOLE.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.834
ANTON COULD SO EASILY FILE
A HUGE LAWSUIT

18:14.834 --> 18:16.333
AGAINST THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

18:16.333 --> 18:17.959
ONCE HE FINDS OUT
HOW YOU FUCKED HIM OVER.

18:17.959 --> 18:19.834
YEAH, IF SOMEONE TOLD HIM.

18:19.834 --> 18:23.250
OF COURSE
I'M GONNA TELL HIM.

18:23.250 --> 18:26.542
YOU'LL SELL OUT A COP
FOR SOME DOPE YOU'RE FUCKING?

18:28.542 --> 18:30.959
THAT'S NOT HALF AS BAD
AS BEING RESPONSIBLE

18:30.959 --> 18:32.375
FOR ANOTHER COP DYING

18:32.375 --> 18:34.375
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
TO PLAY BY THE RULES.

18:36.750 --> 18:37.750
WHAT?

18:37.750 --> 18:40.625
YUKI TOLD ME.

18:40.625 --> 18:44.375
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

18:44.375 --> 18:47.083
[retreating footsteps]

18:57.041 --> 18:58.500
(Dexter)
DESPITE HARRY'S WARNINGS,

18:58.500 --> 19:01.792
HERE I AM WITH MIGUEL,
OUTSIDE BILLY FLEETER'S HOUSE.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.375
IF I'M GONNA STOP THIS,
IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE SOON.

19:14.375 --> 19:15.333
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

19:15.333 --> 19:17.375
IT'S BREAKING
AND ENTERING.

19:17.375 --> 19:18.417
BUT YOU KNOW THAT.

19:18.417 --> 19:21.959
YES, I DO.
LET'S GO.

19:21.959 --> 19:25.250
HERE, PUT THESE ON.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.083
[laughs]

19:27.083 --> 19:30.500
FORENSICS GUY WHO ALWAYS HAS
LATEX GLOVES ON HIM.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.834
NO ONE WOULD
EVER THINK TWICE, HUH?

19:31.834 --> 19:36.166
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.291
[thinking]
I DON'T WANT MIGUEL TO SEE
HOW EASY THIS IS FOR ME.

19:47.375 --> 19:51.500
UH, YOU WANT ME
TO TRY?

19:51.500 --> 19:55.041
NO, I THINK I--

19:55.041 --> 19:56.875
I GOT IT.

20:01.875 --> 20:04.542
SO WHAT ARE
WE LOOKING FOR?

20:04.542 --> 20:06.250
PROOF.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.250
THAT HE'S GUILTY.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.542
WE KNOW HE BLUDGEONS PEOPLE
TO DEATH,

20:10.542 --> 20:14.667
SO LOOK FOR SOMETHING...
BLUDGEONY.

20:21.208 --> 20:25.250
UH, THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN
KNOCKED AROUND SOME.

20:29.500 --> 20:30.667
HOLD IT UP.

20:37.667 --> 20:38.667
PURPLE?

20:38.667 --> 20:40.083
ERGO...

20:40.083 --> 20:41.333
BLOOD.

20:41.333 --> 20:44.709
HOW EASY IS THIS?

20:44.709 --> 20:46.250
I'LL TEST IT AGAINST THE BLOOD
OF HIS ALLEGED VICTIMS.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.250
LET YOU KNOW
LATER TODAY.

20:47.250 --> 20:48.792
YOU KNOW IT TAKES ME TWO DAYS

20:48.792 --> 20:49.959
TO GET A SEARCH WARRANT,

20:49.959 --> 20:52.542
THEN ANOTHER DAY
TO CATALOG EVIDENCE,

20:52.542 --> 20:53.792
AND THEN, A WEEK BEFORE I CAN
GET THE LAB RESULTS.

20:53.792 --> 20:56.583
THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE WAY TO GO.

20:56.583 --> 20:59.250
WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT HE'S LIKELY TO KILL AGAIN.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.417
WHY IS THAT?

21:00.417 --> 21:03.458
IT'S JUST ONE OF THE RULES.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.375
ONE OF THESE DAYS
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU SIT DOWN

21:05.375 --> 21:07.000
AND WRITE OUT ALL THESE RULES
FOR ME, BUT OKAY.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.250
HE--HE KILLS
WHENEVER HE NEEDS MONEY.

21:09.250 --> 21:11.917
THAT'S HOW HE PAYS OFF
HIS DEBTS TO THE BOOKIE.

21:11.917 --> 21:13.917
DEX, I'VE TRIED
A LOT OF THESE GAMBLERS BEFORE,

21:13.917 --> 21:15.417
AND THEY ALL KEEP RECORDS.

21:15.417 --> 21:16.375
THEY'RE LIKE ANAL
ABOUT THEIR NUMBERS.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.792
THERE'S GOT TO BE LIKE A LEDGER

21:17.792 --> 21:19.583
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

21:19.583 --> 21:23.000
MAYBE THERE'S A HIDDEN
WALL SAFE OR SOMETHING.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.917
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MAN
WHO LEAVES HIS MURDER WEAPON

21:24.917 --> 21:26.625
IN AN UMBRELLA STAND.

21:26.625 --> 21:27.959
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.250
WHY SHOULD I CALL IT OFF?

21:52.250 --> 21:56.375
I DIDN'T TEACH YOU THE CODE

BY A STEAK,

22:56.458 --> 22:58.542

THE WAY QUINN EXPLAINED IT WAS,
IF I PLAY BALL,

23:52.875 --> 23:54.500

23:56.500 --> 23:58.083

25:18.041 --> 25:19.417

25:23.917 --> 25:25.458
OKAY.

25:25.458 --> 25:27.166
YOU DON'T WANT TO CREATE
A CRIME SCENE.

25:27.166 --> 25:29.709
IT'S WHERE EXPERTS LIKE ME
GATHER EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU.

25:29.709 --> 25:31.291
OKAY, OKAY,

27:26.709 --> 27:28.917
A NO-HOST BAR
IS PUNISHMENT ENOUGH,

27:28.917 --> 27:30.291
BUT NO BAR AT ALL IS CRUEL.

27:30.291 --> 27:31.959

32:35.375 --> 32:37.083
LOOK, I'LL MEET YOU
AT THAT PLACE ON SECOND STREET

32:37.083 --> 32:39.041
AT 10:00, OKAY?

32:46.125 --> 32:48.458
THE WEDDING BAND HAS TO MATCH
THE ENGAGEMENT RING,

32:48.458 --> 32:49.917
SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE?

32:49.917 --> 32:52.125
[sighs]

32:52.125 --> 32:55.083
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT ONE.

32:55.083 --> 32:57.583
MY GOD, YOU JUST GET DUMBER
EVERY DAY.

32:57.583 --> 32:59.250
HOW DO YOU SURVIVE
IN THIS WORLD?

32:59.250 --> 33:00.083
OF COURSE SHE WANTS ONE.

33:00.083 --> 33:02.375
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW THAT?

33:02.375 --> 33:05.792
YOU'RE SUCH
A Y-CHROMOSOME CLICHE.

33:05.792 --> 33:08.125
JUST BUY HER
A BEAUTIFUL, ROMANTIC,

33:08.125 --> 33:11.291
I LOVE YOU WITH ALL OF MY HEART
FUCKING ENGAGEMENT RING.

33:11.291 --> 33:12.500
AND DEX,

33:12.500 --> 33:14.000
SIZE MATTERS.

33:19.333 --> 33:21.458
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING

33:21.458 --> 33:25.041
NON-JEWELRY-WISE?

33:25.041 --> 33:26.542
GO FOR IT.

33:26.542 --> 33:30.125
OKAY, HYPOTHETICALLY...

33:31.875 --> 33:33.500
LET'S SAY
THAT THIS GUY HAS TO WORK

33:33.500 --> 33:36.000
WITH THIS GIRL,
BUT HE FUCKING HATES DOING IT,

33:36.000 --> 33:37.917
AND TOO BAD 'CAUSE HE HAS
NO FUCKING CHOICE.

33:37.917 --> 33:39.291
AND?

33:39.291 --> 33:44.834
AND ONE THING
LEADS TO ANOTHER...

33:44.834 --> 33:48.917
AND THIS HYPOTHETICAL GUY...

33:48.917 --> 33:51.667
STARTS HAVING SEX
WITH THIS HYPOTHETICAL GIRL.

33:51.667 --> 33:53.333
HYPOTHETICAL SEX?

33:53.333 --> 33:55.500
REAL SEX.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.875
REALLY REAL SEX.

33:58.875 --> 34:00.375
BUT THEN THE GUY IS TOLD
THAT HE NO LONGER HAS TO WORK

34:00.375 --> 34:02.583
WITH THIS GIRL,
AND POOF, HE JUST DISAPPEARS.

34:02.583 --> 34:05.250
YOU KNOW.
THIN AIR. ADIOS.

34:05.250 --> 34:08.083
SO I'M WONDERING,
IS IT POSSIBLE

34:08.083 --> 34:10.792
IF MR. HYPOTHETICAL NEVER REALLY
WAS ALL THAT INTO THIS GIRL?

34:10.792 --> 34:13.709
AND HE WAS JUST GETTING IT ON
TO, I DON'T KNOW, PASS THE TIME

34:13.709 --> 34:17.208
OR SATISFY PRIMAL URGES
OR WHATEVER?

34:17.208 --> 34:20.208
SOUNDS PERFECTLY REASONABLE
TO ME.

34:21.917 --> 34:23.208
WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU KNOW?

34:26.375 --> 34:28.166
THAT ONE.

34:28.166 --> 34:31.000
I GOTTA GO SIT IN A HOT CAR
AND WAIT FOR A SUSPECT.

34:35.709 --> 34:40.000
HEY, ANTON...

34:40.000 --> 34:41.333
WHAT THE FUCK?
CALL ME.

34:56.709 --> 34:58.583
I CAN BRING MARIO IN
MYSELF.

34:58.583 --> 35:00.583
LET YOU GET ALL THE CREDIT
FOR CATCHING THE SKINNER?

35:00.583 --> 35:02.125
NO FUCKING WAY.

35:02.125 --> 35:03.792
WE DON'T KNOW
HE'S THE SKINNER.

35:03.792 --> 35:05.291
CLOSEST THING WE GOT.

35:08.792 --> 35:11.750
THAT WAS REALLY FUCKING UNFAIR
WHAT YOU SAID YESTERDAY.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.000
WELL, IS IT TRUE?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.792
THAT A COP DIED
BECAUSE OF YOU?

35:18.792 --> 35:21.625
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

35:21.625 --> 35:24.458
TRY ME.

35:24.458 --> 35:28.458
YUKI AMADO WAS MY PARTNER
IN NARCOTICS.

35:28.458 --> 35:31.500
THERE WAS ANOTHER DETECTIVE
ON OUR TEAM, STEWART.

35:31.500 --> 35:35.417
HE MADE A BAD JUDGMENT CALL
AND SHOT AN UNARMED COKE DEALER.

35:35.417 --> 35:37.750
I REMEMBER THAT.

35:40.959 --> 35:42.083
PARALYZED HIM,
RIGHT?

35:44.458 --> 35:45.875
THEN STEWART WENT
ON A BENDER

35:45.875 --> 35:47.959
UNTIL HE FINALLY SWALLOWED
HIS OWN BULLET.

35:47.959 --> 35:49.667
HOW DOES YUKI MAKE THAT
YOUR FAULT?

35:49.667 --> 35:54.709
BECAUSE STEWART HAD A PROBLEM
WITH CRYSTAL METH.

35:54.709 --> 35:58.125
AND I KNEW IT.

35:58.125 --> 36:00.291
AND RATHER THAN BUST HIM,
I TRIED TO PROTECT HIM.

36:02.417 --> 36:03.500
SO IT IS YOUR FAULT.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.375
LISTEN TO YOU.

36:05.375 --> 36:07.375
EVERYTHING IS
SO BLACK AND WHITE.

36:07.375 --> 36:09.083
YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED HIM.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.333
YEAH, SURE, IF I KNEW
WHAT I KNEW NOW.

36:10.333 --> 36:11.834
BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY
THINGS WORK.

36:11.834 --> 36:13.333
I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE JUST MAKING EXCUSES.

36:13.333 --> 36:15.709
YEAH, OF COURSE
I'M MAKING EXCUSES.

36:15.709 --> 36:16.667
DON'T YOU?

36:16.667 --> 36:17.667
I MEAN, HOW ELSE
DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?

36:17.667 --> 36:20.000
WHO THE FUCK SAID
I SLEEP AT NIGHT?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.750
THEN YOU MUST BE KILLING
YOURSELF

36:21.750 --> 36:23.667
OVER HOOKING UP WITH ANTON,
HUH?

36:26.792 --> 36:28.041
YEAH, IT WAS PROBABLY
A MISTAKE.

36:28.041 --> 36:28.834
I THINK HE LOST
ALL INTEREST

36:28.834 --> 36:30.500
ONCE HE REALIZED
HE WAS FREE.

36:30.500 --> 36:33.166
NOT SO BLACK
AND WHITE, IS IT?

36:37.834 --> 36:39.709
MARIO.

36:47.667 --> 36:48.792
MARIO ASTORGA?

36:51.583 --> 36:53.083
FUCK!

37:06.625 --> 37:08.542
I'M GUESSING HE DIDN'T WANT
TO COME IN FOR QUESTIONING.

37:08.542 --> 37:09.917
HE MADE A RUN FOR IT.

37:09.917 --> 37:11.667
(Quinn)
INTERVIEW TWO.

37:11.667 --> 37:14.583
WHAT'S HIS STORY?

37:14.583 --> 37:15.709
SO FAR,
HE HASN'T SAID A WORD.

37:15.709 --> 37:17.500
AH, YOU KEEP AT IT.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.500
AND YOU CHECK WITH NICARAGUAN
AUTHORITIES ON PRIORS.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.709
(Debra)
WE'RE JUST WAITING
TO HEAR BACK.

37:21.709 --> 37:24.208
[speaks Spanish]

37:24.208 --> 37:25.625
I'M NEVER GONNA GET OUT
OF HERE.

37:25.625 --> 37:29.000
I GOTTA CALL BARBARA
AND CANCEL OUR DINNER.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.333
OH, SHE'S NOT GONNA LIKE THAT.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.125
I MEAN, IT--IT'S WORK.

37:34.125 --> 37:36.500
(Barbara on phone)
I'M NOT HERE.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.542
LEAVE A MESSAGE.

37:37.542 --> 37:38.500
[beep]

37:38.500 --> 37:40.083
HELLO, BARBARA.

37:40.083 --> 37:44.709
THIS IS SERGEANT ANGEL BATISTA.

37:44.709 --> 37:47.166
ANGEL TO YOU.

37:47.166 --> 37:48.834
HOW ARE YOU?

37:48.834 --> 37:50.834
GOOD I HOPE.

37:50.834 --> 37:56.291
SO I HAVE TO CANCEL
OUR DINNER TONIGHT.

37:56.291 --> 38:00.500
AND I AM DEEPLY,
DEEPLY APOLOGETIC.

38:00.500 --> 38:04.917
AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LET ME
MAKE IT UP TO YOU

38:04.917 --> 38:07.417
IN WHATEVER POSSIBLE WAY

38:07.417 --> 38:09.750
YOU WISH THINGS MADE UP

38:09.750 --> 38:13.417
TO YOU IN.

38:22.792 --> 38:25.542
OH, I CAN TELL

38:25.542 --> 38:27.625
BY THAT LOOK
ON YOUR FACE,

38:27.625 --> 38:29.959
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO TELL ME SOMETHING

38:29.959 --> 38:31.083
I DON'T WANNA HEAR.

38:35.542 --> 38:37.750
CALLING OFF THE KILL.

38:37.750 --> 38:38.792
IT'S OVER.

38:38.792 --> 38:41.375
REALLY, DEX?

38:41.375 --> 38:44.291
JUST BECAUSE SOME GUY
RECOGNIZED ME IN A BAR?

38:44.291 --> 38:46.959
NO ONE IS EVER GONNA MAKE
THAT CONNECTION

38:46.959 --> 38:48.208
ONCE FLEETER DISAPPEARS.

38:48.208 --> 38:50.458
I'M NOT TAKING
THAT CHANCE.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.250
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WAY
YOU DO THINGS. RIGHT.

38:52.250 --> 38:53.333
NO, IT ISN'T.

38:54.917 --> 38:56.125
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

38:57.834 --> 38:58.834
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING?

38:58.834 --> 39:01.125
I WASN'T GONNA BRING IT UP
BEFORE,

39:01.125 --> 39:03.375
BUT I'M GUESSING...

39:03.375 --> 39:05.083
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A WHILE.

39:05.083 --> 39:08.250
FREEBO WASN'T YOUR FIRST.

39:08.250 --> 39:10.166
WAS HE?

39:15.333 --> 39:16.458
HOW MANY, DEX?

39:18.667 --> 39:21.667
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

39:21.667 --> 39:26.125
I WILL RESPECT
YOUR PRIVACY.

39:26.125 --> 39:27.625
BUT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

39:27.625 --> 39:30.542
WHY ARE YOU NOT GONNA
HELP ME HERE?

39:30.542 --> 39:33.709
JUST BECAUSE WE--WE BROKE
THIS LITTLE RULE FROM YOUR CODE?

39:33.709 --> 39:35.417
COME ON, DEX.
IT'S OKAY.

39:35.417 --> 39:36.625
NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.834
[sighs]

39:42.500 --> 39:43.792
YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE ASKED ME
TO HELP YOU.

39:43.792 --> 39:44.875
YOU'RE NOT READY.

39:44.875 --> 39:46.875
I'M NOT--
OR IS IT YOU THAT'S NOT READY?

39:46.875 --> 39:48.625
HUH?

39:48.625 --> 39:50.083
BECAUSE WE COULD HAVE DEALT
WITH THIS FLEETER PROBLEM

39:50.083 --> 39:51.375
LIKE THREE TIMES ALREADY,

39:51.375 --> 39:53.083
AND YOU KEEP THROWING UP
ALL OF THESE ROADBLOCKS

39:53.083 --> 39:54.125
WITH ALL THIS CODE BULLSHIT.

39:54.125 --> 39:56.458
IT'S NOT BULLSHIT.

39:56.458 --> 39:57.583
OH, COME ON.
KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT, DEX.

39:57.583 --> 40:00.041
COME ON, IT'S LIKE WEARING
A FUCKING STRAITJACKET, MAN.

40:00.041 --> 40:03.709
NO, MIGUEL,
IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE.

40:03.709 --> 40:07.333
IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE CODE,
THE DARKNESS--

40:20.083 --> 40:21.667
I COULD STAND HERE
AND TELL YOU

40:21.667 --> 40:25.041
ANOTHER STORY
ABOUT MY ABUSIVE FATHER,

40:25.041 --> 40:26.709
BUT WHAT I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU
ABOUT IS THE TIME

40:26.709 --> 40:28.375
THAT I KICKED THE SHIT
OUT OF HIM

40:28.375 --> 40:30.041
AND KNOCKED HIM
DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.

40:30.041 --> 40:31.458
AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT.

40:34.750 --> 40:36.417
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE

40:36.417 --> 40:39.375
THAT I'VE EVER FELT...

40:39.375 --> 40:43.500
POWERFUL LIKE...

40:43.500 --> 40:46.500
LIKE I WAS IN CONTROL
OF--OF SOMETHING.

40:46.500 --> 40:47.834
AND EVER SINCE THEN,
I'VE BEEN TRYING

40:47.834 --> 40:50.375
TO--TO GET THAT FEELING
BACK AGAIN.

40:50.375 --> 40:55.375
SO WHEN YOU TALK TO ME
ABOUT...

40:55.375 --> 40:59.333
THE DARKNESS
INSIDE OF YOU...

40:59.333 --> 41:03.959
I UNDERSTAND.

41:03.959 --> 41:04.917
I REALLY DO.

41:08.041 --> 41:11.000
I JUST WANT TO LET SOME
OF MINE OUT TOO.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.500
[sighs]

41:16.792 --> 41:21.250
I KNOW
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.

41:26.208 --> 41:28.583
YOU KNOW WHAT,
MR. ASTORGA?

41:28.583 --> 41:31.542
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE OPENED
WITH MY CLOSER.

41:31.542 --> 41:33.542
MEANING?

41:33.542 --> 41:35.375
WE KNOW ABOUT THE INCIDENT
IN MANAGUA,

41:35.375 --> 41:38.375
THE ONE WHERE YOU STABBED
A CAB DRIVER.

41:38.375 --> 41:40.625
HE TOUCHED MY SISTER.

41:40.625 --> 41:42.083
SADLY, HE SURVIVED.

41:43.291 --> 41:44.500
THAT'S A HEARTBREAKING STORY.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.625
STILL YOU ARE AN ILLEGAL GUEST

41:46.625 --> 41:49.208
OF OUR COUNTRY.
IMMIGRATION'S ON THE WAY.

41:49.208 --> 41:51.083
YOU'RE GONNA BE ON A PLANE
BEFORE THE SUN COMES UP.

41:51.083 --> 41:52.834
BUT I HAVE A SON.

41:52.834 --> 41:53.834
HE WAS BORN HERE.

41:53.834 --> 41:54.875
HE'S A U.S. CITIZEN.

41:54.875 --> 41:56.041
HE'S MY LIFE.

41:56.041 --> 41:57.083
YOUR BOY'S A U.S. CITIZEN?

41:57.083 --> 41:58.375
YES.

41:58.375 --> 42:00.208
THEN HE STAYS.
MAYBE YOUR WIFE TOO.

42:00.208 --> 42:01.458
WE DON'T KNOW YET.

42:01.458 --> 42:02.667
BUT WE DO KNOW
IS IF YOU KEEP

42:02.667 --> 42:04.125
STONEWALLING US
ON THIS SKINNER CASE,

42:04.125 --> 42:05.667
YOU ARE GONE
ON A ONE-WAY TICKET.

42:05.667 --> 42:08.583
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU TRY TO DO TO ME,

42:08.583 --> 42:10.125
THE FACTS AIN'T CHANGING.

42:10.125 --> 42:11.625
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYTHING.

42:11.625 --> 42:13.792
THEN WHY WOULD GEORGE KING
SUGGEST OTHERWISE?

42:20.792 --> 42:22.792
SENOR KING SAID
I KNEW SOMETHING?

42:22.792 --> 42:25.834
IN A WORD?

42:25.834 --> 42:26.667
YUP.

42:30.583 --> 42:33.667
AND SENOR KING WILL BE
VERY DISAPPOINTED

42:33.667 --> 42:35.166
TO HEAR YOU'RE CALLING HIM
A LIAR.

42:35.166 --> 42:37.000
NO!

42:37.000 --> 42:38.083
PLEASE.

42:38.083 --> 42:40.709
WHAT ARE YOU SO AFRAID OF,
MARIO?

42:43.041 --> 42:45.166
YEAH, WHAT'D THIS GUY
DO TO YOU?

42:45.166 --> 42:46.542
WHAT CAN  HE DO TO YOU?

42:46.542 --> 42:49.709
PLEASE.

42:49.709 --> 42:51.500
SEND ME BACK TO NICARAGUA.

42:51.500 --> 42:52.542
ALONE?

42:52.542 --> 42:54.667
SI.
YES.

42:54.667 --> 42:56.041
ALONE.

42:56.041 --> 42:59.667
[hyperventilating]

43:05.125 --> 43:07.917
WE MENTIONED GEORGE KING'S NAME
ONCE AND HE TURNS TO JELL-O.

43:07.917 --> 43:09.291
SCARED TO DEATH
OF HIM.

43:09.291 --> 43:10.458
YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

43:10.458 --> 43:11.417
YEAH, KING JOBBED US.

43:11.417 --> 43:14.917
I'M GONNA ISSUE A BOLO FOR HIM.

43:23.208 --> 43:26.333
[phone rings]

43:26.333 --> 43:28.375
HELLO?

43:28.375 --> 43:29.458
SHIT.

43:31.917 --> 43:32.917
WHO WAS IT?

43:32.917 --> 43:35.458
UH, ME.

43:35.458 --> 43:38.709
I WAS CHECKING TO SEE
IF MY PHONE WAS WORKING.

43:40.291 --> 43:43.250
BARBARA NEVER CALLED ME BACK.

43:43.250 --> 43:44.750
I THINK I RUINED IT.

43:44.750 --> 43:47.834
SORRY.

43:47.834 --> 43:49.917
DATING SUCKS.

43:49.917 --> 43:53.375
YEAH.

43:53.375 --> 43:56.709
WELL, I'M OUTTA HERE.

43:56.709 --> 43:59.083
STILL NO GEORGE KING,
BUT WE PUT THE WORD OUT.

44:12.709 --> 44:13.750
BARBARA.

44:16.291 --> 44:18.417
MM.

44:18.417 --> 44:20.458
YOU GOT MY MESSAGE.

44:20.458 --> 44:24.291
YUP.
BEEN LISTENING TO IT ALL DAY.

44:24.291 --> 44:27.125
MAKES ME LAUGH
EVERY TIME.

44:27.125 --> 44:29.083
IT'S PRETTY BAD, HUH?
