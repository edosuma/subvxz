You and Carol, pick a date.

No!

29:43.172 --> 29:44.739
I'm not picking a date!

You shouldn't even
be living here,

yuppie assholes!

to tell yourself that

29:52.181 --> 29:54.270

but that's not true.

29:54.314 --> 29:56.751
Yes, we have made mistakes,
and we will fix them.

We promise.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.362
Please don't do this.

30:02.539 --> 30:04.454
