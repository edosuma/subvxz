<c.speaker>[gasps]

01:05.583 --> 01:07.333
<c.speaker>[Elena]
Shuriki?

01:07.333 --> 01:09.166
<c.speaker>Blaze!

01:09.166 --> 01:10.375
<c.speaker><i>Canaza! </i>

01:12.208 --> 01:14.208
<c.speaker>Those pages are blank!

01:14.208 --> 01:16.291
<c.speaker>Or <i>are </i>they?

01:16.291 --> 01:17.291
<c.speaker><i>Quittiz! </i>

01:19.750 --> 01:22.083
<c.speaker>[gasps] What does it say?

01:22.083 --> 01:24.833
<c.speaker>How we can defeat
Princess Elena.

01:24.833 --> 01:27.291
<c.speaker>What is all that?

01:27.291 --> 01:30.208
<c.speaker>A hidden message
from my grandfather.

01:30.208 --> 01:32.458
<c.speaker>The Scepter of Night?

01:35.583 --> 01:37.000
<c.speakerTop>[Elena reads title]

01:38.333 --> 01:40.375
<c.speakerTop>Okay, let me get this straight.

01:40.375 --> 01:42.583
<c.speakerTop>Shuriki and Fiero
stole the pages

01:42.583 --> 01:45.000
<c.speakerTop>so they could find
another magic scepter?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.416
<c.speakerTop>Yes. The Scepter of Night.

01:47.416 --> 01:49.000
<c.speakerTop>According to
everything I've read,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
<c.speakerTop>it's just as powerful
as Elena's Scepter of Light.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.958
<c.speakerTop>But we found a secret message
from Mateo's <i>abuelo, </i>Alacazar.

01:54.958 --> 01:57.083
<c.speakerTop>Show her.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.875
<c.speakerTop>Illuminate!

02:00.291 --> 02:01.458
<c.speaker>[gasps]

02:01.458 --> 02:04.291
<c.speaker>[Naomi] Whoa.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.583
<c.speaker>I suppose everyone knew about
this new scepter power, too?

02:07.583 --> 02:09.250
<c.speaker>- Yeah.
- Kind of.

02:09.250 --> 02:11.458
<c.speaker>Hmph. Last time
I take a day off.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.458
<c.speaker>So, what does it say?

02:13.458 --> 02:15.875
<c.speaker>Alacazar found
the Scepter of Night

02:15.875 --> 02:18.500
<c.speaker>and wanted to make sure
it would be well protected,

02:18.500 --> 02:21.166
<c.speaker>so he broke it
into three pieces--

02:21.166 --> 02:24.458
<c.speaker>the staff, the mount,
and the jewel.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.583
<c.speaker>He left the staff
right where he found it,

02:26.583 --> 02:29.166
<c.speaker>and hid the other two pieces.

02:29.166 --> 02:31.458
<c.speaker>- Where?
- We don't know yet.

02:31.458 --> 02:34.250
<c.speaker>When you find one piece,
a hidden riddle leads you
to the next.

02:34.250 --> 02:37.375
<c.speaker>Man, you wizards
never do things
the easy way, do you?

02:37.375 --> 02:40.458
<c.speaker>Hey, if it keeps Shuriki from
getting the Scepter of Night,

02:40.458 --> 02:41.375
<c.speaker>I'm all for it.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.416
<c.speaker>So what's the first riddle?

02:43.416 --> 02:46.458
<c.speaker>Illuminate!

02:46.458 --> 02:50.583
<c.speaker>"In the City of Pyramids,
look into the eye of the place

02:50.583 --> 02:54.166
<c.speaker>where macaws crawl
and tortoises fly."

02:54.166 --> 02:57.500
<c.speaker>Ohh. City of Pyramids.

02:57.500 --> 03:00.458
<c.speaker>That's gotta be Tepet Muul--
the capital of ancient Maru.

03:00.458 --> 03:01.583
<c.speaker>[Gabe] But what
about the rest?

03:01.583 --> 03:04.625
<c.speaker>Tortoises don't fly;
macaws fly.

03:04.625 --> 03:06.375
<c.speaker>This doesn't make any sense.

03:06.375 --> 03:08.166
<c.speaker>That's what
makes it a riddle.

03:08.166 --> 03:11.500
<c.speaker>I just hope Shuriki
doesn't figure it out first.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.333
<c.speaker>All right, then,
I'm going after her.

03:14.333 --> 03:15.583
<c.speaker>What?! Elena!

03:16.958 --> 03:18.750
<c.speaker>Man, is she fast!

03:21.458 --> 03:24.708
<c.speaker>[Carla]
Where tortoises fly
and macaws crawl?

03:24.708 --> 03:27.208
<c.speaker>Argh! Who came up with that?!

03:27.208 --> 03:30.291
<c.speaker>Someone who was obviously
much more clever
than all of you.

03:30.291 --> 03:32.458
<c.speaker>Here. Let <i>me </i>see those pages.

03:32.458 --> 03:34.375
<c.speaker>You must have missed something.

03:34.375 --> 03:36.208
<c.speaker>I miss nothing!

03:36.208 --> 03:40.708
<c.speaker>Says the man who got turned
into a statue by a teenager.

03:40.708 --> 03:43.500
<c.speaker>[both laugh]

03:43.500 --> 03:47.000
<c.speaker>Shuriki,
we will cover more ground
if we split up.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
<c.speaker>Yes, yes. Anything to stop
your incessant chatter.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.500
<c.speaker>Excellent. Shuriki and I
will go this way,

03:53.500 --> 03:56.500
<c.speaker>and you two...
go that way.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.875
<c.speaker><i>We </i>should go
with Shuriki.

03:58.875 --> 04:00.708
<c.speaker>No, no, this is fine.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.750
<c.speaker>Come along, Carla.

04:02.750 --> 04:05.375
<c.speaker>Fiero acts like
he's so much better,

04:05.375 --> 04:08.291
<c.speaker>but if it wasn't for us,
he'd still be a bird perch.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.958
<c.speaker>And how he's gonna be
her Royal Malvago,

04:10.958 --> 04:12.833
<c.speaker>and we're nothing!

04:12.833 --> 04:15.625
<c.speaker>That is why
we're splitting up, Carla.

04:15.625 --> 04:18.375
<c.speaker>So you and I
can find the scepter

04:18.375 --> 04:20.875
<c.speaker>and prove to Shuriki
we are superior.

04:20.875 --> 04:24.375
<c.speaker>Then she will finally
make us malvagos!

04:24.375 --> 04:27.000
<c.speaker>But Fiero will still
be her number one,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.208
<c.speaker>and we'll be number two.

04:29.208 --> 04:31.625
<c.speaker>One scheme at a time.

04:31.625 --> 04:34.583
<c.speaker>Right now, we have
a riddle to solve.

04:34.583 --> 04:38.291
<c.speaker>[Victor]
We must find the scepter
before Fiero.

04:40.583 --> 04:44.583
<c.speaker>Elena! You're not supposed
to leave the palace, remember?

04:44.583 --> 04:48.333
<c.speaker>But we know where Shuriki's
going, <i>and </i>she has a head start.

04:48.333 --> 04:51.583
<c.speaker>The Royal Guards
wouldn't get there in time.
But me, on a Jaquin...

04:51.583 --> 04:54.958
<c.speaker>You have to consult
the Grand Council first.

04:54.958 --> 04:58.625
<c.speaker>I wonder what kind of powers
the Scepter of Night has...

04:58.625 --> 05:00.958
<c.speaker>Mateo! Focus.

05:00.958 --> 05:04.625
<c.speaker>My family's in Cordoba
firming up our alliance
with King Juan Ramon.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.583
<c.speaker>But Naomi's here.
What do you think?

05:07.583 --> 05:12.333
<c.speaker>Uh, I'm not sure.
Gabe does have a point,
but so do you.

05:12.333 --> 05:14.625
<c.speaker>I would sure love to
get a hold of that scepter

05:14.625 --> 05:16.375
<c.speaker>and see how it works.

05:16.375 --> 05:17.875
<c.speaker>But it's not the whole scepter.

05:17.875 --> 05:19.583
<c.speaker>It's only the staff.

05:19.583 --> 05:22.125
<c.speaker>We can wait until
the rest of the council is back

05:22.125 --> 05:23.250
<c.speaker>to discuss this.

05:23.250 --> 05:24.875
<c.speaker>Gabe's right. You should stay.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.750
<c.speaker>But the scepter's too powerful.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.000
<c.speaker>We can't let Shuriki
get any of it.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.708
<c.speaker>Mateo's right.
You should go.

05:30.708 --> 05:33.125
<c.speaker>Well, that's
two council votes
right there.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.875
<c.speaker>Now, normally I'd wait
for the others,

05:34.875 --> 05:37.208
<c.speaker>but this is an emergency
and we don't have time.

05:37.208 --> 05:38.958
<c.speaker>I can't let
something happen to you.

05:38.958 --> 05:41.166
<c.speaker>I say that as Captain
of the Royal Guard.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.708
<c.speaker>And...as your friend.

05:43.708 --> 05:46.458
<c.speaker>- Then come with me--
all of you.
- What?

05:46.458 --> 05:48.458
<c.speaker>We make a great team.

05:48.458 --> 05:51.208
<c.speaker>We beat Shuriki, Fiero,
and Victor before.

05:51.208 --> 05:52.583
<c.speaker>We can do it again.

05:52.583 --> 05:54.500
<c.speaker>And get that scepter.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.000
<c.speaker>Arghh. Fine,
on one condition.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.625
<c.speaker>I run point on this mission.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.375
<c.speaker>It's for your own safety.

06:00.375 --> 06:02.708
<c.speaker>Which means you all
have to follow my lead.

06:02.708 --> 06:04.208
<c.speaker>- Got it?
- Got it.

06:04.208 --> 06:06.500
<c.speaker>- I'm in.
- [Elena] Mateo?

06:07.583 --> 06:09.458
<c.speaker>Huh? Right, sure.

06:10.708 --> 06:13.458
<c.speaker>Okay, Gabe.
Lead the way.

06:13.458 --> 06:15.333
<c.speaker>All right. Move out!

06:16.500 --> 06:17.750
<c.speaker>Unhh! Ow.

06:25.625 --> 06:27.583
<c.speaker>[Migs]
All right, Jaquins,

06:27.583 --> 06:29.000
<c.speaker>square up and fly tight.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.208
<c.speaker>I want all eyes
scanning the ground.

06:31.208 --> 06:34.708
<c.speaker>Ooh, Migsy, I love it
when you're so serious.

06:34.708 --> 06:37.333
<c.speaker>Not here, pookie-face.

06:37.333 --> 06:39.583
<c.speaker>No! No, no,
please go on,

06:39.583 --> 06:42.208
<c.speaker>pookie-face.
Ha ha ha!

06:42.208 --> 06:43.708
<c.speaker>Look sharp, everyone.

06:43.708 --> 06:45.458
<c.speaker>We're there.

06:45.458 --> 06:47.000
<c.speaker>[Mateo]
Tepet Muul.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.375
<c.speaker>The Pyramid City of Maru.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.375
<c.speaker>I don't see any sign of Shuriki.

06:51.375 --> 06:54.500
<c.speaker>Good, then we can figure out
that riddle and find the staff.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.708
<c.speaker>Ah, not so fast.
It's a big complex.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.083
<c.speaker>First we need to do
a thorough search

06:59.083 --> 07:00.583
<c.speaker>to make sure
she's not already here.

07:00.583 --> 07:03.291
<c.speaker>- But it--
- Gabe's calling
the shots, Mateo.

07:03.291 --> 07:05.708
<c.speaker>And I agree with him.
If they're here,

07:05.708 --> 07:08.583
<c.speaker>I'd rather surprise them--
not the other way around.

07:08.583 --> 07:11.208
<c.speaker>- Exactly.
- Yeah, but if we just--

07:11.208 --> 07:12.750
<c.speaker>No! We'll start at the far end

07:12.750 --> 07:15.750
<c.speaker>and follow a standard grid
pattern as we work our way back.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.708
<c.speaker>Hut, hut, hut!

07:17.708 --> 07:20.250
<c.speaker>Luna, I need--
I mean, we need

07:20.250 --> 07:22.208
<c.speaker>to get that scepter
before Shuriki.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.583
<c.speaker>I don't know, Mateo.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.375
<c.speaker>We're supposed to follow
Gabe's lead on this.

07:25.375 --> 07:28.208
<c.speaker>Look, whoever wields that
scepter will have a power

07:28.208 --> 07:30.166
<c.speaker>unlike any the world's seen.

07:30.166 --> 07:34.208
<c.speaker>If I collect the pieces first,
I could beat Shuriki myself!

07:34.208 --> 07:36.833
<c.speaker>Hmm. Maybe you're right.

07:36.833 --> 07:40.875
<c.speaker>I know I'm right.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.000
<c.speaker>This must be the place!

08:52.708 --> 08:56.458
<c.speaker>The scepter's gotta be hidden
somewhere inside.

08:56.458 --> 08:58.291

10:07.875 --> 10:09.875
<c.speaker>Where--?

10:11.583 --> 10:12.875
<c.speaker>Hmm...

10:12.875 --> 10:14.375
<c.speaker>It has to b--

10:16.583 --> 10:18.458
<c.speaker>Where's the staff?

10:22.166 --> 10:24.958
<c.speaker>It was supposed
to be here!

10:24.958 --> 10:27.000
<c.speaker>This must be
the wrong pyramid.

10:28.875 --> 10:32.208
<c.speaker>[groaning]

10:32.208 --> 10:34.875
<c.speakerTop>[Shuriki]
Another empty pyramid.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.708
<c.speaker>You're supposed to be
a great malvago,

10:36.708 --> 10:38.708
<c.speaker>and you can't even
figure out a children's riddle.

10:38.708 --> 10:40.750
<c.speaker>There must be more
to the riddle.

10:40.750 --> 10:45.291
<c.speaker>It said, "When you see macaws
crawl and tortoises fly,"

10:45.291 --> 10:47.625
<c.speaker>but that doesn't
make any sense.

10:47.625 --> 10:49.125
<c.speaker>[Carla]
Or does it?

10:49.125 --> 10:52.375
<c.speaker>Look over there.
See those macaws?

10:52.375 --> 10:54.083
<c.speaker>They're not up top
like the others.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.375
<c.speaker>They're down at the base.

10:55.375 --> 10:57.708
<c.speaker>They look like
they're <i>crawling. </i>

10:57.708 --> 10:59.708
<c.speaker>[Fiero]
And the tortoises
are at the top.

10:59.708 --> 11:01.416
<c.speaker>They look like
they are flying.

11:01.416 --> 11:04.250
<c.speaker>The scepter must be
in that pyramid.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.333
<c.speaker>I figured it out.
I did it!

11:06.333 --> 11:07.958
<c.speaker>What?! <i>I </i>did it!

11:07.958 --> 11:10.583
<c.speaker>No! It was <i>I. </i>

11:10.583 --> 11:13.000
<c.speaker>And now <i>I </i>will get the scepter.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
<c.speaker>Not if I get it first!

11:14.000 --> 11:16.750
<c.speaker>Uggh.

11:19.291 --> 11:22.000
<c.speaker>[Elena] Mateo.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.875
<c.speaker>We've been looking
everywhere for you.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.250
<c.speaker>We agreed
to stay in formation!

11:27.250 --> 11:31.000
<c.speaker>Sorry, but I was trying
to find the scepter
before Shuriki does.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.250
<c.speaker>We all want to do that.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.250
<c.speaker>But you have to
follow the plan.

11:34.250 --> 11:37.750
<c.speaker>My plan. Remember me?
The one in charge?

11:37.750 --> 11:39.750
<c.speaker>Uh, guys? Look!

11:39.750 --> 11:43.958
<c.speaker>That pyramid has tortoises
flying and macaws crawling.

11:43.958 --> 11:45.583
<c.speaker>[gasp]
You found it!

11:45.583 --> 11:47.000
<c.speaker>You're welcome.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.583
<c.speaker>Let's go!

11:48.583 --> 11:50.125
<c.speaker>Mateo!

11:51.375 --> 11:54.875
<c.speaker>The plan! Arggh!

11:54.875 --> 11:58.708
<c.speaker>[Elena]
Mateo, slow down!

12:03.458 --> 12:05.458
<c.speaker>- Mateo!
- I have to--

12:05.458 --> 12:07.458
<c.speaker>[both gasp]

12:10.083 --> 12:11.958
<c.speaker><i>Boqato, Boqato, Boqato! </i>

12:13.291 --> 12:14.625
<c.speaker>Blaze!

12:19.708 --> 12:22.333
<c.speaker>[Gabe]
Everyone take cover!

12:26.583 --> 12:28.416
<c.speaker>Hmm.

12:28.416 --> 12:31.083
<c.speaker>I have a plan.
When I give the word,

12:31.083 --> 12:33.875
<c.speaker>run to the carriage
and wait for me
in the jungle.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.208
<c.speaker>What about
the Scepter of Night?

12:35.208 --> 12:38.125
<c.speaker>That's part of the plan!
Now go!

12:38.125 --> 12:41.416
<c.speaker>This better work.

12:42.458 --> 12:43.458
<c.speaker><i>Boqato! </i>

12:43.458 --> 12:44.500
<c.speaker>Look out!

12:46.083 --> 12:47.875
<c.speaker>[all coughing]

12:47.875 --> 12:50.000
<c.speaker>[Luna] Ohh!

12:50.000 --> 12:53.250
<c.speaker>And I was having such
a great feather day.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.250
<c.speaker>Blaze!

12:59.625 --> 13:01.958
<c.speaker>Bl--
Where'd they go?

13:01.958 --> 13:03.875
<c.speaker>[horse whinnies]

13:03.875 --> 13:05.291
<c.speaker>We can still catch them!

13:05.291 --> 13:07.958
<c.speaker>Skylar, let's fly!

13:07.958 --> 13:09.250
<c.speaker>Wings up!

13:09.250 --> 13:11.083
<c.speaker>But the staff
is this way!

13:11.083 --> 13:12.708
<c.speaker>We'll come back
for it later.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.875
<c.speaker>No! You guys go after Shuriki,
I'm getting it <i>now. </i>

13:15.875 --> 13:19.125
<c.speaker>But we need you!
Shuriki and Fiero have magic!

13:19.125 --> 13:21.833
<c.speaker>Gabe's right!
We're stronger <i>together. </i>

13:21.833 --> 13:24.166
<c.speaker>I have to find it!

13:25.458 --> 13:26.708
<c.speaker>Mateo!

13:26.708 --> 13:28.125
<c.speaker>Now what are we
going to do?

13:28.125 --> 13:29.500
<c.speaker>Everybody just wait here

13:29.500 --> 13:31.333
<c.speaker>and keep an eye out
in case they come back.

13:31.333 --> 13:33.250
<c.speaker>I'll go get Mateo.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.958
<c.speaker>What?! Elena!

13:34.958 --> 13:37.166
<c.speaker>She said to wait,
Gabe.

13:37.166 --> 13:39.250
<c.speaker>Arghh!
Mateo!

13:45.166 --> 13:47.000
<c.speaker>Maybe...

13:48.458 --> 13:50.125
<c.speaker>[grunts]

13:50.125 --> 13:52.750
<c.speaker>Hmm. There has to be
a way to get in.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.458
<c.speaker>Hey, this stone
is sticking out.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.166
<c.speaker>Mateo, stop! Ohh!

14:09.625 --> 14:11.458
<c.speaker>OK, what do we do next?

14:11.458 --> 14:12.958
<c.speaker>What are you doing here?

14:12.958 --> 14:14.833
<c.speaker>I thought I told you
to leave!

14:14.833 --> 14:16.500
<c.speaker>You appear to be
outnumbered.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.416
<c.speaker>You may need a hand,
my friend.

14:18.416 --> 14:20.958
<c.speaker>You are mistaken,
not-my-friend.

14:20.958 --> 14:25.208
<c.speaker>Nevertheless,
where you go--
ha ha--I go.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.125
<c.speaker>Ay. Very well.

14:27.125 --> 14:29.000
<c.speaker>Just don't get in my way.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.250
<c.speaker>[both panting]

14:37.208 --> 14:38.583
<c.speaker>Aaah!

14:39.583 --> 14:41.375
<c.speaker>Ohh! Looks like a dead end.

14:41.375 --> 14:43.875
<c.speaker>Good, 'cause we're supposed
to be looking for Shuriki,

14:43.875 --> 14:45.250
<c.speaker>like we all agreed on?

14:45.250 --> 14:48.500
<c.speaker>Yes, but finding the staff
is more important.

14:48.500 --> 14:52.208
<c.speaker>If we have both scepters,
we'll be unstoppable.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.875
<c.speaker>This is the best way
to beat her.

14:56.875 --> 14:58.500
<c.speaker>Trust me.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.083
<c.speaker>[sighs] OK.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.125
<c.speaker>What was the riddle again?

15:03.125 --> 15:06.125
<c.speaker>"In the City of Pyramids,
look into the eye

15:06.125 --> 15:09.708
<c.speaker>of the place
where macaws crawl
and tortoises fly."

15:11.291 --> 15:13.458
<c.speaker>[Elena] Hmm.

15:13.458 --> 15:14.625
<c.speaker>The eye.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.375
<c.speaker>What are you doing?

15:19.375 --> 15:21.125
<c.speaker>[softly grunting]

15:22.375 --> 15:24.250
<c.speaker>Looking into the eye.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.000
<c.speaker>There's something inside it.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.083
<c.speaker>Whoa!

15:34.125 --> 15:36.708
<c.speaker>Wow!

15:36.708 --> 15:39.500
<c.speaker>This has to be it.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.125
<c.speaker>Mateo, wait up!

15:59.291 --> 16:01.083
<c.speaker>We got it!

16:01.083 --> 16:03.958
<c.speaker>The first piece
of the scepter.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.291
<c.speaker>- First piece?
- Shh.

16:07.291 --> 16:10.125
<c.speaker>But where is--Uhhh!

16:10.125 --> 16:12.208
<c.speaker>Don't you ever--

16:12.208 --> 16:13.958
<c.speaker>Shh.

16:13.958 --> 16:16.166
<c.speaker>Now, where's the riddle
to the next piece?

16:16.166 --> 16:19.291
<c.speaker>Well, if your grandfather
made it, he wouldn't have
left it out in the open.

16:19.291 --> 16:21.583
<c.speaker>Of course!
It would be hidden!

16:23.166 --> 16:24.250
<c.speaker>Illuminate!

16:32.083 --> 16:34.250
<c.speaker>[gasps] Mateo?
The floor.

16:34.250 --> 16:41.208
<c.speaker>"In the Valley of Stars,
find the sun that sparkles
inside the moon."

16:41.208 --> 16:44.166
<c.speaker>Another doozy.
OK, let's--

16:44.166 --> 16:45.166
<c.speaker>[Fiero] <i>Boqato! </i>

16:47.708 --> 16:49.708
<c.speaker>[both grunting]

16:49.708 --> 16:51.000
<c.speaker>Fiero?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.500
<c.speaker><i>Meyázami! </i>

16:52.500 --> 16:53.625
<c.speaker>Whoa!

16:55.083 --> 16:57.458
<c.speaker>I've got it from here,
my friend.

16:57.458 --> 16:59.708
<c.speaker>Victor!

16:59.708 --> 17:01.958
<c.speaker>Mateo, come on!

17:01.958 --> 17:05.208
<c.speakerTop>I can't believe it.
I led them right to it.

17:05.208 --> 17:06.875
<c.speakerTop>What was I thinking?

17:06.875 --> 17:09.333
<c.speaker>Well, you were thinking
about what <i>you </i>wanted,

17:09.333 --> 17:11.625
<c.speaker>and not what was best
for everyone.

17:11.625 --> 17:14.333
<c.speaker>But now you have the chance
to make up for it.

17:18.458 --> 17:21.458
<c.speaker>Because they're getting away...?

17:23.250 --> 17:24.250
<c.speaker>Aaah!

17:24.250 --> 17:26.333
<c.speaker>[footsteps approach]

17:26.333 --> 17:28.125
<c.speaker>- Did you hear that?
- Yeah-- Uhh!

17:29.375 --> 17:30.458
<c.speaker>Thank you.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.833

17:37.583 --> 17:39.416
<c.speaker>Get the staff out of here!

17:39.416 --> 17:40.625
<c.speaker>You got it!

<c.speaker>- Yes!
- Give me that!

18:11.250 --> 18:12.875

19:29.291 --> 19:31.458
<c.speaker>At least we got the staff.

<c.speaker>What's taking them so long?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.083
<c.speaker>[both grunting]

19:40.083 --> 19:42.458
<c.speaker>Did it work?
Did you get it?

19:42.458 --> 19:45.458
<c.speaker>I had the staff,
until <i>he </i>got in the way.

19:45.458 --> 19:48.375
<c.speaker>No. It was <i>I  </i>
who had the staff.

19:48.375 --> 19:51.375
<c.speaker>Staff? What are you
talking about?

19:51.375 --> 19:54.958
<c.speaker>The old royal wizard
broke the Scepter of Night
into pieces

19:54.958 --> 19:57.458
<c.speaker>and hid the rest of them
somewhere else.

19:57.458 --> 20:00.333
<c.speaker>Fortunately,
<i>I </i>heard the riddle

20:00.333 --> 20:02.375
<c.speaker>that leads to
the next piece.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.583
<c.speaker>If only you had the intellect
to solve it.

20:04.583 --> 20:06.333
<c.speaker>Oh, I have the intellect.

20:06.333 --> 20:09.291
<c.speaker>Silence! We must locate
the next piece immediately!

20:09.291 --> 20:12.291
<c.speaker>Then we can take
the first piece
from the princess

20:12.291 --> 20:14.458
<c.speaker>when she comes for it.

20:14.458 --> 20:16.875
<c.speaker>There may be hope
for you yet, girl.

20:16.875 --> 20:20.500
<c.speaker>You two, get in.
There's no time to waste.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.416
<c.speaker>- Ahh!
- Oww!

20:22.416 --> 20:23.750
<c.speaker><i>Adelante! </i>

20:23.750 --> 20:26.333
<c.speaker>[Fiero, Victor yelling]

20:30.458 --> 20:32.958
<c.speakerTop>The good news is,
we have the first piece...

20:32.958 --> 20:34.375
<c.speaker>and the second riddle.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.625
<c.speaker>It's too bad Shuriki
got away.

20:36.625 --> 20:38.583
<c.speaker>But they heard
the second riddle,

20:38.583 --> 20:40.375
<c.speaker>so we know where they're going.

20:40.375 --> 20:44.083
<c.speaker>- If we can figure it out.
- [Mateo] Uh, guys?

20:44.083 --> 20:46.458
<c.speaker>I owe all of you
an apology.

20:50.250 --> 20:53.125
<c.speaker>Are we getting it
anytime soon?

20:53.125 --> 20:56.458
<c.speaker>I was so fixated
on finding that scepter

20:56.458 --> 20:58.208
<c.speaker>and learning its magic,

20:58.208 --> 21:01.583
<c.speaker>like somehow that would
make me a stronger wizard.

21:01.583 --> 21:04.375
<c.speaker>I should have
stuck with the plan.

21:04.375 --> 21:08.250
<c.speaker>But I was selfish,
and I put you all in danger.

21:08.250 --> 21:12.000
<c.speaker>I'm sorry,
and I promise,
it won't happen again.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.250
<c.speaker>That was worth the wait.

21:16.250 --> 21:18.375
<c.speaker>I don't know.
If you were in my squad,

21:18.375 --> 21:20.458
<c.speaker>I'd still make you drop
and give me twenty.

21:20.458 --> 21:23.166
<c.speaker>If that's what it takes.

21:23.166 --> 21:24.416
<c.speaker>[grunting]

21:24.416 --> 21:26.208
<c.speaker>Aaah!

21:26.208 --> 21:28.833
<c.speaker>Uhh. Ahh. One.

21:30.416 --> 21:31.958
<c.speaker>Unhh...

21:31.958 --> 21:34.000
<c.speaker>Just get up.
You're forgiven.

21:41.208 --> 21:42.291
<c.speaker>So, Gabe,

21:42.291 --> 21:44.250
<c.speaker>what's our next plan?

21:44.250 --> 21:46.458
<c.speaker>Well, I think
we should solve
that second riddle.

21:46.458 --> 21:48.583
<c.speaker>As soon as someone
tells us what it is.

21:48.583 --> 21:50.208
<c.speaker>Gather around.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.500
<c.speaker>It's gonna take all of us
to figure this one out.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.416
<c.speaker>Ready when you are,
<i>Princesa. </i>

22:05.583 --> 22:08.000
