01:06.583 --> 01:07.880
Dia.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.355
English boys don't go
to school every day.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.108
Teacher say this country
was founded as a utopia.

02:49.285 --> 02:51.845
Do you know
what that word means, Papa?

02:52.021 --> 02:54.387
Well, she says someday
when the war is over...

02:54.557 --> 02:56.957
...our world will be a paradise.

02:57.126 --> 02:59.492
And all this you learn in one day?

02:59.662 --> 03:01.789
And math and science.

03:02.165 --> 03:06.033
This is too much learning. Tomorrow,
you will stay home and mend the nets, yes?

03:06.202 --> 03:07.328
No, Papa.

03:07.503 --> 03:09.801

05:01.651 --> 05:03.744
Papa!

05:20.003 --> 05:21.971

05:22.138 --> 05:23.799
Bring forward the next one.

05:25.541 --> 05:27.907
- Long sleeve or short sleeve?
- No.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.907
Young man. You must understand.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.743
The government wants you to vote, okay?

05:34.917 --> 05:38.580
They gonna tell you say,
"The future is in your hands."

05:38.755 --> 05:40.985
We now the future.

05:41.157 --> 05:42.749
So we take your hands.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.359
- No.
- No more hands, no more voting.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.859
Chop him.

05:52.535 --> 05:56.471
Spread the word.
The Revolutionary United Front is coming.

05:58.007 --> 06:02.307
- RUF!
- RUF! RUF!

06:04.147 --> 06:07.810
Bring forward the next one.
Bring him forward. Bring him forward.

06:10.486 --> 06:12.613
Long sleeve or short sleeve?

06:14.123 --> 06:15.522
- Short sleeve!
- Chop him.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.051
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

06:20.363 --> 06:21.887
Not this one. Look at him.

06:22.865 --> 06:24.389
- Put him in the truck.
- Let's go.

06:24.567 --> 06:25.966
Bring him to the mines.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.296
He can work. He can work.
Move, move, move.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.234
Next one, next one, next one.

06:35.778 --> 06:37.405
<i>Throughout the history of Africa...</i>

06:37.880 --> 06:40.110
...whenever a substance
of value is found...

06:42.452 --> 06:44.818
...the locals die
in great number and in misery.

06:45.354 --> 06:50.690
Now, this was true of ivory,
rubber, gold and oil.

06:50.860 --> 06:52.259
It is now true of diamonds.

06:54.330 --> 06:57.891
<i>According to a devastating report</i>
<i>by Global Witness...</i>

06:58.067 --> 07:02.902
<i>... these stones are being used</i>
<i>to purchase arms and finance civil war.</i>

07:03.072 --> 07:05.870
We must act to prohibit...

07:06.042 --> 07:10.376
...the direct or indirect import
of all rough diamonds from conflict zones.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.008
<i>May I remind you...</i>

07:18.187 --> 07:23.124
...that the U.S. is responsible for two-thirds
of all diamond purchases worldwide...

07:23.292 --> 07:26.887
<i>... and I don't anticipate</i>
<i>that demand diminishing.</i>

07:27.463 --> 07:29.294
<i>We must remember</i>
<i>that these stones...</i>

07:29.465 --> 07:34.425
<i>... comprise only a small percentage</i>
<i>of the legitimate diamond industry...</i>

07:34.604 --> 07:39.473
...whose trade is crucial to the economies
of many emerging nations.

07:39.642 --> 07:42.907
The Freetown government
and their white masters...

07:43.079 --> 07:45.707
...have raped your land
to feed their greed.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.975
RUF have freed you.

07:48.151 --> 07:51.484
- No more slave and master here.
<i>- It's true.</i>

07:51.654 --> 07:56.751
Current estimates are that conflict stones
account for only 15 percent of the market.

07:56.926 --> 07:59.326
But in a multi-billion-dollar-a-year
industry...

07:59.495 --> 08:02.555
...that means hundreds of millions
of dollars are available...

08:02.732 --> 08:04.632
...for weapons in these conflict zones.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.268
RUF is fighting for the people!

08:07.436 --> 08:10.200
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

08:10.373 --> 08:15.242
Any bastard think he would joke
with me diamond, I go cut he throat.

08:17.446 --> 08:18.572
Stop!

08:19.782 --> 08:24.014
And we are joined today
by members of that diamond industry...

08:24.520 --> 08:27.819
...who wholeheartedly
endorse your proposal.

08:27.990 --> 08:31.653
I hope you join me
in applauding their presence here.

08:31.827 --> 08:35.092
Mr. Van De Kaap and Mr. Simmons.

08:44.006 --> 08:45.701
Give it to me.

09:19.275 --> 09:22.540
Don't worry. We'll be fine, huh?

09:22.712 --> 09:27.081
Listen. You take off
as soon as I'm out the door.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.684
You don't land
until I raise you on the sat phone.

09:31.287 --> 09:32.515
You be careful, Danny.

09:32.688 --> 09:37.216
Don't worry. They want these guns
too much to do anything stupid.

09:51.073 --> 09:53.098
Where is Commander Zero?

09:55.278 --> 09:57.439
I am Captain Rambo.

09:58.547 --> 10:01.846
Right. Right, I've seen your films, huh?

10:05.054 --> 10:07.488
I'm looking for Commander Zero, huh?

10:07.657 --> 10:09.488
He's inside. You talk to me.

10:09.659 --> 10:12.628
You are here to help us
in our struggle against the government.

10:12.795 --> 10:15.355
I'm here to do business
with Commander Zero, all right?

10:31.781 --> 10:33.180
All right.

10:33.349 --> 10:37.581
You are the man, huh?
You are the man.

10:40.690 --> 10:41.918
Here, huh?

10:53.969 --> 10:56.938
Hey. I'm talking to you! Stop!

10:57.106 --> 10:59.165
- Commander Zero.
- Hey.

10:59.342 --> 11:02.004
- I go kill you, eh?
- It's fine, huh? It's fine.

11:02.178 --> 11:05.807
Commander Zero. Commander Zero.

11:05.981 --> 11:09.007

11:16.525 --> 11:17.787
You get something for me?

11:17.960 --> 11:20.554

You get for pay me first for them.

11:43.486 --> 11:44.976
This no fine, huh?

11:45.154 --> 11:46.519
This no fine.

11:53.562 --> 11:54.995
...and their new weapons, huh?

11:55.164 --> 11:57.462
Maybe I could kill you
and take what you bring.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.533
Then you get one more dead body...

11:59.702 --> 12:02.364
...instead of airplane
way full with grenade launchers.

12:03.339 --> 12:05.534
So I'm think I'm gonna go
to them government.

12:05.708 --> 12:08.142
Them government,
at least them go pay me, huh?

12:08.310 --> 12:11.177
Wait, wait. Wait, my friend.

This is the thing you want? Here.

12:17.686 --> 12:19.847

12:26.629 --> 12:28.096
Yeah. Yeah.

12:52.054 --> 12:53.544
Hello, hello, hello.

13:03.966 --> 13:07.595
I've got a letter from the minister of interior
and a Liberian visa as well.

13:07.770 --> 13:10.238
I'm doing a story on the Marrakaz,
who, as you know...

13:10.406 --> 13:13.739
...are allowed to cross the border
in order to get into grazing grounds.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.235
You ever read <i>National Geographic</i>, huh?

13:57.686 --> 13:59.950
- You're under arrest for smuggling.
- No, no, no.

14:00.122 --> 14:02.818
Listen here, my friend.
Listen here, all right?

14:02.992 --> 14:05.460
I am good friends
with Colonel Coetzee.

14:06.028 --> 14:09.930
Colonel Coetzee would not be pleased
that you've interfered with his business.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.828
Now, you know who I am, all right?

14:12.001 --> 14:14.868
You don't wanna make trouble for me
or my friends, all right?

14:15.037 --> 14:18.734
Now, look, why don't I just
look the other way, all right?

You take one or two of those stones
and get something lacquer for the wife...

14:22.711 --> 14:26.545
...or maybe the mistress, all right?
We'll solve the problem right here, huh?

14:27.283 --> 14:29.979
We'll go back to Freetown
and ask Colonel Coetzee...

14:30.152 --> 14:33.144
...how he wishes
to thank his business associate.

14:33.322 --> 14:34.983
Guys, take him away.

15:21.604 --> 15:23.868
Hey! What the fuck?

Fuckheads wasting my time now.
How am I work in this shit?

15:53.669 --> 15:55.136

16:59.201 --> 17:00.793

The government troops are coming!

17:08.609 --> 17:11.010

17:42.077 --> 17:43.442

<i>RUF! RUF! RUF!</i>

18:54.917 --> 18:57.385
<i>RUF! RUF! RUF!</i>

19:03.292 --> 19:04.657
Hey.

19:05.260 --> 19:07.228
What did you do with it?

19:07.396 --> 19:09.523
I'm talking to you, you hear me?

19:10.999 --> 19:14.127
Where the diamond? The pink one.

19:14.303 --> 19:17.067
- I saw you take it.
- You're mad. I do not know you.

19:17.239 --> 19:21.175
Liar! I saw it with my own eyes.

19:22.044 --> 19:25.980
This big. Biggest I have ever seen.

19:27.449 --> 19:30.748
My brothers, I go give $ 1000...

19:30.919 --> 19:34.377
...to the man who cuts the diamond
out of this bastard.

19:34.556 --> 19:38.014
You the craze! You the craze!

19:38.193 --> 19:39.820
Where is the diamond?

19:39.995 --> 19:43.192
Where is the diamond?
Do you see a diamond?

19:44.266 --> 19:49.135
You devils have taken my family!
My home! I done lost everything!

19:49.905 --> 19:53.466
Here, look. What is left?

19:53.642 --> 19:55.542
What is left?

19:55.711 --> 19:58.373
If there is a diamond,
you are the one who has taken it!

19:58.547 --> 20:00.515
Liar! The man is a liar!

20:01.183 --> 20:04.949
I know your name, Solomon Vandy!
You have a name!

20:05.120 --> 20:09.216
You have a family!
And I'll catch them!

20:09.391 --> 20:11.188
And I'll find them!

20:28.510 --> 20:31.172
Please tell me you brought me
cigarettes, <i>bru</i>, please.

20:31.346 --> 20:32.779
I just have to tell you, Danny.

20:32.948 --> 20:35.974
The colonel's not going to be happy
about you losing the diamonds.

20:36.151 --> 20:39.018
Forget the colonel.
There's a fisherman in there, all right?

20:39.187 --> 20:41.815
He might've found a pink. Big one.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.117
What about the colonel?
He'll want that stone.

20:44.293 --> 20:46.761
Screw the colonel.
I'll contact our friends in London.

20:46.929 --> 20:50.763
If this stone is as big as I think,
we're gonna need a real buyer, all right?

20:51.233 --> 20:54.031
What? What?

20:54.202 --> 20:56.898
London wants nothing more
to do with you.

20:57.439 --> 21:01.603
"Arrest in Sierra Leone of Daniel Archer,
former mercenary and smuggler..."

21:01.777 --> 21:04.405
"Retains close ties
to Van De Kaap diamond cartel.

21:04.579 --> 21:07.707
Sources say they deny
any affiliation whatso..."

21:07.883 --> 21:09.976
Fucking hell.

21:11.453 --> 21:13.546
Listen, his name
is Solomon Vandy, all right?

21:13.722 --> 21:17.385
Van De Kaap is gonna want that stone,
whatever they say. You just get him out.

21:17.559 --> 21:19.151
Get him out.

21:22.197 --> 21:27.066
Yeah, can you tell Mr. Simmons
that Danny Archer called. Right.

21:27.502 --> 21:31.233
Archer. A-R-C-H-E-R.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.058
Afternoon, darling, huh?

21:57.232 --> 22:01.134
Big white man all alone.
That is no fine.

22:01.303 --> 22:05.763
- I'm safe, huh? No HIV.
- Yeah, yeah. I've heard that one before.

22:05.941 --> 22:09.206
Archer, I know where to get
nice baby diamond just for you.

22:09.378 --> 22:11.278
- Not now, next time.
- Come on, Archer.

22:11.446 --> 22:13.744
I said not now, next time. Bugger off.

23:05.867 --> 23:07.767
Solomon Vandy?

23:08.770 --> 23:10.635
What do you want?

23:10.806 --> 23:13.673
It seems you made a friend in prison.

23:38.767 --> 23:40.997
- Hey.
- How the body, Mr. Archer?

23:41.169 --> 23:42.966
The body fine, M'Ed.

23:48.176 --> 23:49.939
So you want something nice, huh?

23:50.545 --> 23:53.309
The best you can get ahold of, all right?

23:53.482 --> 23:57.009
Take me a few days,
but I go find you something special.

23:57.185 --> 24:00.018
All right. You hear
they took Marampa yesterday?

24:01.223 --> 24:02.690
- Really?
- Now, come on.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.520
You know every move they make.
When are they gonna hit us?

24:05.694 --> 24:10.131
Oh, I imagine they come
do some shopping very soon.

24:10.298 --> 24:13.529
Yeah, yeah.
Got any smokes back there?

24:13.702 --> 24:15.260
Yeah.

24:24.412 --> 24:26.175
Who's that, huh?

24:27.449 --> 24:29.007
All right.

24:35.590 --> 24:39.219
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks.

24:39.461 --> 24:41.053
You listening to this?

24:41.229 --> 24:43.697
<i>I am profoundly sorry.</i>

24:43.865 --> 24:47.426
The world is falling apart,
and all we hear about is Blowjobgate.

24:48.270 --> 24:49.498
<i>I believe he's sorry.</i>

24:49.671 --> 24:53.072
When was the last time the world
wasn't falling apart, huh?

24:55.143 --> 24:59.011
A cynic. Why don't you sit down
and make me miserable?

25:01.516 --> 25:03.711
- Danny Archer.
- Maddy Bowen.

25:03.885 --> 25:05.682
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

25:06.054 --> 25:08.488
- American, huh?
- Guilty.

25:08.657 --> 25:10.921
Well, Americans usually are.

25:11.393 --> 25:13.793
Says the white South African?

25:14.829 --> 25:16.820
I'm from Rhodesia.

25:18.667 --> 25:21.158
We say Zimbabwe now,
don't we?

25:21.336 --> 25:24.601
- Do we?
- Last time I checked.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.934
Don't tell me,
you're here to make a difference.

25:27.108 --> 25:30.339
- And you're here to make a buck?
- I'm here for lack of a better idea.

25:31.179 --> 25:32.976
- That's a shame.
- Not really.

25:33.148 --> 25:35.412
Peace Corps types only
stay around long enough...

25:35.584 --> 25:37.484
...to realize they're not helping anyone.

25:37.652 --> 25:39.517
Government only wants
to stay in power...

25:39.688 --> 25:42.589
...until they've stolen enough
to go into exile somewhere else.

25:42.757 --> 25:45.385
And the rebels, they're not sure
they want to take over.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.892
Otherwise,
they'd have to govern this mess.

25:48.063 --> 25:50.361
- But TIA, right, M'Ed?
- TIA.

25:50.532 --> 25:51.760
What's TIA?

25:52.400 --> 25:56.302
- "This is Africa," huh?
- Right.

25:56.871 --> 25:59.339
- You want another?
- Sure.

26:03.144 --> 26:05.669
So which one are you?

26:07.148 --> 26:10.413
- Smuggler?
- Am I?

26:10.585 --> 26:13.520
Somehow you don't strike me
as the UNICEF type.

26:14.556 --> 26:16.524
How about soldier of fortune?

26:16.992 --> 26:19.552
Or is that too much of a cliché?

26:19.728 --> 26:21.059
Diamonds?

26:21.763 --> 26:25.358
- If I told you I was a missionary...?
- For Van De Kaap?

26:27.068 --> 26:29.662
Better watch that type of talk,
Miss Bowen.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.932
In America, it's bling-bling,
but out here, it's bling-bang, huh?

26:33.208 --> 26:36.336
I wouldn't want you
getting in any trouble.

26:37.612 --> 26:39.876
How much trouble
do you think I would get into...

26:40.048 --> 26:43.313
...for talking about blood diamonds?

26:46.121 --> 26:49.181
- You're a journalist.
- That's right.

26:53.128 --> 26:54.720
Piss off, huh?

26:59.067 --> 27:02.332
For five years, this country has reported
almost no diamond exports...

27:02.504 --> 27:06.167
...while Liberia, right next door,
has exported 2 billion dollars' worth.

27:06.341 --> 27:09.367
Very odd, considering that Liberia
has no diamonds to speak of.

27:09.544 --> 27:10.533
I'm shocked.

27:10.712 --> 27:14.045
Van De Kaap denies trading blood
diamonds, but admits it's impossible...

27:14.215 --> 27:18.549
...to tell where a diamond comes from
unless their smuggler gets caught.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.415
What do you want from me, huh?

27:20.588 --> 27:25.116
You know all about Van De Kaap.
Help me out. Off the record.

27:25.360 --> 27:29.820
Well, off the record, I like to get kissed
before I get fucked, huh?

27:32.400 --> 27:33.594
Shit.

28:06.935 --> 28:10.427
- Cordell. How is it, Shona?
- Long time, pal.

28:10.605 --> 28:13.972
- How's Alice?
- She's well, thanks.

28:14.142 --> 28:15.973
Tim must be in school, right?

28:16.144 --> 28:18.476
- Big kids, big problems, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

28:18.646 --> 28:21.240
I heard you got into a spot of trouble
in the bush, huh?

28:21.416 --> 28:23.816
Well, you know the bush, right, <i>bru?</i>

28:24.586 --> 28:27.146
- Company doing well?
- Can't complain.

28:27.322 --> 28:29.950
Eleven wars in the continent.
We're keeping busy.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.559
So, what, you're here on holiday, huh?

28:34.262 --> 28:36.162
- How's the colonel?
- He sends his regards.

28:36.331 --> 28:40.028
Good, good. Score us a loose, huh?

28:41.136 --> 28:43.331
Smoking will kill you, <i>bru</i>.

28:43.605 --> 28:44.833
Only if I live, right?

28:50.178 --> 28:52.078
That's for breaking my TV, <i>bru</i>.

28:56.951 --> 29:00.478
Tell the colonel he'll get his money.
I'll come see him soon.

29:07.228 --> 29:08.456
Ten more.

29:08.630 --> 29:11.531
Come. Come.

29:17.639 --> 29:19.129
Go on.

29:33.321 --> 29:37.257
Dia. Dia. Come here.
Get away from there.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.521
Go. Go, Mama.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.629
Stay down.

30:00.748 --> 30:02.409
Excuse me,
my name's Solomon Vandy...

30:02.584 --> 30:04.677
- Check the list.
- I have checked the list.

30:04.853 --> 30:09.313
- File papers at the Office for Refugees.
- Sir, I have filed papers with the office.

30:09.491 --> 30:11.482
Then God help you,
because I can't.

30:11.659 --> 30:12.717
- Please, sir...
- Next.

30:12.894 --> 30:15.021
- Sir... Sir, no, please.
- Hey, hey. Me, me, me.

30:15.196 --> 30:18.962
Husband here. One year we look.

30:23.471 --> 30:25.632
Hurry, Mom. Go.

30:30.812 --> 30:32.177
Dia! Dia!

30:32.347 --> 30:33.336
- Jassie!
- Dia!

30:33.515 --> 30:35.107
- Mama!
- Dia!

30:35.283 --> 30:37.444
Jassie! Mama!

30:59.707 --> 31:02.540
He's been waiting.
What took you?

31:03.244 --> 31:06.611
What are you gonna do,
shoot me right here, huh, Shona?

31:06.781 --> 31:09.875
Now, don't be a wanker, man. Get in.

31:41.950 --> 31:44.350
- Hello, Danny.
- Colonel.

31:44.519 --> 31:46.316
You look well.

31:46.487 --> 31:49.650
Clean living and a pure heart,
I suppose, huh?

31:49.991 --> 31:51.686
Walk with me.

31:53.461 --> 31:56.294
It seems the rebels have taken back
the diamond fields, Danny.

31:56.464 --> 31:58.796
The government
of Sierra Leone has contracted us...

31:58.967 --> 32:00.935
...to go in there
and take the rebels down.

32:01.102 --> 32:02.694
So you sell the rebels weapons...

32:02.870 --> 32:05.532
...the government hires you
when they use them? Nice, sir.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.874
I assume you're asking
for mining concessions, huh?

32:09.043 --> 32:12.171
We save the government,
they show their gratitude.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.645
And you get rich, right?

32:18.953 --> 32:20.511
How long have I known you, Danny?

32:20.955 --> 32:24.118
I was... I was 19, sir.

32:24.359 --> 32:28.887
And you survived.
A lot of boys didn't. Why is that?

32:30.298 --> 32:32.960
Just lucky, I guess.

32:34.869 --> 32:39.738
No, you were a good soldier.
But I made you better, didn't I?

32:43.111 --> 32:44.544
Yes, sir. Yes, you did.

32:44.712 --> 32:47.738
And over the years,
didn't I protect you...

32:48.149 --> 32:52.108
...teach you about diamonds,
cut you in on the deals?

32:52.286 --> 32:55.949
- Some might call it that, yeah.
- But not you...

32:56.924 --> 33:00.587
...because you done with me now, eh?
On to bigger things.

33:03.731 --> 33:06.199
I need a man that knows
his way around up there.

33:06.367 --> 33:10.133
Unless, of course,
you wanna cut me in. Something pink?

33:11.205 --> 33:12.729
Sir...

33:12.907 --> 33:15.034
Our deal went bad,
and you owe me money.

33:15.209 --> 33:16.938
I'll take a stone as payment.

33:17.111 --> 33:20.979
Look, do you think if I found a stone
like that, I'd still be on this continent?

33:21.149 --> 33:24.983
- Come on.
- Danny, give me your hand.

33:27.989 --> 33:31.720
That's red earth. It's in our skin.

33:32.193 --> 33:34.593
The Shona say the color
comes from all the blood...

33:34.762 --> 33:37.322
...that's being spilled
fighting over the land.

33:39.367 --> 33:43.929
This is home.
You'll never leave Africa.

33:46.708 --> 33:49.370
If you say so, sir.

34:04.892 --> 34:08.521
So, what did you do, bury it?

34:09.731 --> 34:13.292
Yeah. Yeah, I would have
buried it, huh?

34:13.467 --> 34:17.495
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about? Come on, <i>bru</i>.

34:17.672 --> 34:19.105
I'm late for work.

34:19.273 --> 34:21.797
Pink, huh? The biggest one
he'd ever seen.

34:21.976 --> 34:24.103
You were in the mining camps,
weren't you, <i>bru?</i>

34:24.277 --> 34:27.770
Why else would that rebel with
the bandaged arm make up such a story?

34:27.949 --> 34:30.179
Go ask him.

34:44.498 --> 34:45.726
Thank you.

34:55.376 --> 34:58.174
Your mothers and fathers,
your brothers and sisters are dead.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.211
- You are dead! You have been reborn.
- No!

35:00.381 --> 35:03.612
- We are your family now.
- No! No!

35:11.492 --> 35:13.824
Your parents are weak.

35:14.395 --> 35:18.832
They're the farmers.
They're the fishermen.

35:19.333 --> 35:22.894
They've done nothing
but suck the blood from this country.

35:24.272 --> 35:28.732
But you are the heroes
who will save this nation.

35:29.010 --> 35:30.978
You are not children anymore.

35:31.979 --> 35:33.913
You're men.

35:36.117 --> 35:39.280
No one has ever given you respect...

35:39.453 --> 35:42.547
...but with this in your hand,
they go fear you.

35:42.723 --> 35:45.214
If you do not get
the respect you deserve...

35:45.393 --> 35:47.691
...you will take it
by shedding their blood.

35:47.862 --> 35:51.821
- Repeat after me, shed their blood.
- Shed their blood.

35:51.999 --> 35:55.059
- Louder! Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Shed their blood!

35:55.236 --> 35:58.364
Make them hear you in Freetown.
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

35:58.539 --> 36:01.099
<i>Shed their blood! Shed their blood!</i>
<i>Shed their blood!</i>

36:01.275 --> 36:04.176
- Dia Vandy, stand up.
<i>- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!</i>

36:04.345 --> 36:07.246
<i>- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!</i>
- Put your hand on the gun.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.007
<i>Shed their blood!</i>
<i>Shed their blood!</i>

36:09.183 --> 36:10.775
<i>Shed their blood!</i>
<i>Shed their blood!</i>

36:10.952 --> 36:13.978
<i>- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!</i>
- Now squeeze the trigger.

36:14.522 --> 36:18.925
Come on, Dia. Pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger!

36:53.060 --> 36:57.622
I know, I know.
It's hard to be a man.

36:58.366 --> 37:00.891
Sit up. Come.

37:01.068 --> 37:05.368
But you are a soldier
of the revolution now.

37:05.573 --> 37:08.440
And I am your commander.

37:08.943 --> 37:10.808
Whatever you need...

37:10.978 --> 37:14.209
...guns, CDs, food...

37:14.382 --> 37:18.045
...come to me.
I will take care of you.

37:21.355 --> 37:27.760
Today, you are promoted
to the rank of captain.

37:32.366 --> 37:34.357
Dia Vandy...

37:35.970 --> 37:37.801
...boss man.

37:55.556 --> 37:57.183
How's it, <i>bru?</i>

37:57.725 --> 38:00.888
- You got something for me, huh?
- Yeah.

38:01.662 --> 38:05.063
- So, what's new, M'Ed?
- Fucking RUF.

38:05.232 --> 38:07.757
Tried to hit the government building
across the street.

38:07.935 --> 38:12.599
Shit, man, half the people
be soldiers today, RUF tomorrow.

38:12.773 --> 38:16.174
- Might be time to get your family out, huh?
- And go where?

38:16.344 --> 38:20.075
Just fire up the chopper
and fly away like you people?

38:20.448 --> 38:22.279
This my country, man.

38:22.450 --> 38:25.908
We here long before you came,
long after you gone.

38:34.929 --> 38:38.092
- Hi. I'm Maddy Bowen.
- How about you dance with me?

38:38.265 --> 38:41.632
- No, I don't dance.
- Neither do I. Come on.

38:46.841 --> 38:49.241
- So, Danny...
- Archer.

38:49.543 --> 38:50.601
Archer.

38:51.612 --> 38:55.173
When did you first start
moving stones? Was it Angola?

38:56.951 --> 39:01.547
Then you did the whole
mercenary thing. Was that fun?

39:03.090 --> 39:06.753
So, what are you?
Nihilist? Opportunist?

39:06.961 --> 39:09.088
Maybe I wasn't breast-fed
as a child, huh?

39:11.232 --> 39:13.666
You think I haven't met
people like you before?

39:13.834 --> 39:17.201
- I think you get off on people like me.
- You think?

39:19.940 --> 39:22.465
When did you first start
working for Van De Kaap?

39:23.044 --> 39:24.671
Christ, you never stop, do you?

39:25.946 --> 39:29.313
No, I never stop.

39:30.017 --> 39:31.609
Do you want me to stop?

39:32.987 --> 39:36.889
Why don't we go back to your place,
see what's in the minibar, huh?

39:37.058 --> 39:39.151
I'm a print journalist. I drank it.

39:40.428 --> 39:43.158
Is it possible that you don't care
how many people die...

39:43.330 --> 39:45.230
...because of the deals you do?

39:45.399 --> 39:48.630
People here kill each other as a way of life.
Always been like that.

39:48.903 --> 39:51.736
So you can just watch it
and go about your day?

39:53.040 --> 39:55.133
Maybe we should all just
write about it, then.

39:55.309 --> 39:57.641
Look, thanks for the dance, huh?

39:59.847 --> 40:03.214
- And a shot too, huh, M'Ed?
- Sure.

40:07.054 --> 40:08.351
You're a hard case, huh?

40:08.522 --> 40:11.514
Tell me something,
how long you been here in Africa, huh?

40:11.725 --> 40:15.024
Three months. And before that,
Afghanistan and Bosnia.

40:15.329 --> 40:17.422
You come here
with your laptop computer...

40:17.598 --> 40:21.534
...and your malaria medicine
and your little bottles of hand sanitizer.

40:22.303 --> 40:25.329
Think you're gonna change
the outcome, huh?

40:25.506 --> 40:28.100
Let me tell you something.
You sell blood diamonds too.

40:28.275 --> 40:29.765
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:29.944 --> 40:30.933
Tell me, how is that?

40:31.112 --> 40:33.376
Who do you think buys
the stones that I bring out?

40:33.547 --> 40:37.176
Dreamy American girls who all want
a storybook wedding and a big, shiny rock...

40:37.351 --> 40:40.912
...like the ones in the advertisements
of your politically-correct magazines.

40:41.088 --> 40:44.080
So, please, don't come here
and make judgments on me, all right?

40:45.493 --> 40:49.793
I provide a service. The world wants what
we have, and they want it cheap.

40:49.964 --> 40:53.195
We're in business together.
Get over yourself, darling.

40:53.667 --> 40:57.763
Okay, just to clarify, not all American girls
want a storybook wedding...

40:57.938 --> 41:00.839
...just like not all Africans kill each other
as a way of life.

41:01.008 --> 41:03.408
And yeah, it's a shit, shit world,
but you know what?

41:03.577 --> 41:07.445
Good things are done every day,
just, apparently, not by you.

41:09.049 --> 41:12.075
This place is about to explode.

41:12.353 --> 41:14.378
I wanna spend my time
with someone else.

41:25.466 --> 41:28.492
<i>You are listening to BBC World Service.</i>

41:28.669 --> 41:32.400
<i>In Sierra Leone, Revolutionary United Front</i>
<i>forces have been sighted...</i>

41:32.573 --> 41:35.303
<i>... within 10 kilometers</i>
<i>of the capital city of Freetown.</i>

41:35.476 --> 41:38.138
<i>The minister of the interior</i>

41:38.312 --> 41:40.678
<i>... that the government troops</i>
<i>can repel the attack.</i>

41:40.848 --> 41:44.113
<i>All foreign nationals are being advised</i>
<i>to leave the country.</i>

41:44.285 --> 41:46.446
<i>There are also unconfirmed reports...</i>

41:46.620 --> 41:50.681
<i>... that atrocities are being committed by</i>
<i>both sides in the rapidly worsening situation.</i>

41:50.858 --> 41:54.794
<i>The United Nations has described</i>
<i>the refugee situation as critical.</i>

42:06.373 --> 42:08.773
Don't tell me you're gonna try
and sell it yourself.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.468
To who?
And for what price, my friend?

42:11.645 --> 42:13.670
You need my help,
whether you like it or not.

42:13.847 --> 42:16.907
- What are you talking about?
- Here, let me help you with that.

42:17.084 --> 42:20.952
You hear that? You hear that?
They came into the city overnight.

42:21.121 --> 42:23.419
It's started.
What are you gonna do now, huh?

42:23.591 --> 42:27.891
Listen, the right stone can buy anything.
Information, safety, even freedom.

42:28.062 --> 42:30.496
But a big stone does not stay secret
for very long.

42:30.664 --> 42:33.929
The moment you tell anyone about it,
your life is absolutely worthless.

42:34.101 --> 42:37.229
The only reason you're alive is
you haven't told anyone where it is.

42:37.404 --> 42:38.666
Am I right? Am I?

42:39.073 --> 42:41.098
Who do you think got you
out of jail, huh?

42:41.275 --> 42:44.335
- That makes us partners.
- I am not your partner!

42:44.511 --> 42:47.002
What if I helped you find your family?

42:47.181 --> 42:48.705
What do you know of my family?

42:48.882 --> 42:51.908
The relief agencies are useless,
the hospitals are overwhelmed.

42:52.086 --> 42:54.680
- There are other ways, <i>bru</i>.
- Liar.

42:54.855 --> 42:58.086
Look at me. I know people, huh?
White people.

42:58.259 --> 43:01.387
Without me, you're just another
black man in Africa, all right?

43:04.765 --> 43:06.494
Oh, shit.

43:08.235 --> 43:09.827
We got no time.
What's it gonna be?

43:10.004 --> 43:11.995
You would say anything.
How can I trust you?

43:12.172 --> 43:15.573
I don't give a fuck about you, all right?
That diamond could be priceless!

43:15.743 --> 43:20.009
We split it, and you get your family.
What's it gonna be, yes or no? Yes or no?

43:20.180 --> 43:22.774
- Where will we go? Where do we go?
- Come on, follow me!

43:54.214 --> 43:55.841
Stay low!

43:57.718 --> 43:58.946
Get your ass over here!

44:09.997 --> 44:11.055
Wait!

44:11.498 --> 44:13.159
Now!

44:18.305 --> 44:19.863
Come on, come on.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.276
Come on!

44:41.495 --> 44:43.087
Come on.

44:43.263 --> 44:44.457
Fuck!

44:53.741 --> 44:55.572
No, this way.

44:56.009 --> 44:57.499
Fire!

45:13.727 --> 45:15.160
Fuck! Go, go, go!

45:15.462 --> 45:17.054
Go!

45:27.074 --> 45:28.871
Shit!

45:29.042 --> 45:30.703
No! No!

45:39.186 --> 45:40.915
This way.

46:00.774 --> 46:02.935
This way. Stay low.

46:14.354 --> 46:16.117
Come on. Go, go, go. Come on.

46:23.096 --> 46:24.859
Come on!

46:30.237 --> 46:32.762
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

46:58.499 --> 47:00.592
Fire!

48:42.436 --> 48:46.202
- Is there another way?
- That bridge is the only way across, huh?

48:46.373 --> 48:48.534
So, what do we do?

48:59.353 --> 49:04.120
- You are RUF, huh? And I am your prisoner.
- What do you mean?

49:04.291 --> 49:07.351
You wanna see your son again, don't you?
You stay behind me.

49:08.061 --> 49:09.688
Wait, wait. Wait.

49:12.699 --> 49:15.395
Bring that pink chicken skin
over here, huh?

49:15.569 --> 49:17.969
Now let me shoot that pink ass, boy.

49:53.674 --> 49:55.608
Where are we going?

49:56.376 --> 49:58.936
Lungi's under government control.

49:59.112 --> 50:03.572
I'm gonna try to locate a sat phone
to get in contact with my pilot, all right?

50:03.750 --> 50:06.116
I have agreed to nothing.

50:06.987 --> 50:09.478
You're in a bit of a conundrum there,
my friend.

50:09.656 --> 50:13.922
You know what that means?
It means you have no choice.

50:27.808 --> 50:30.971
So you're a fisherman, huh?

50:31.144 --> 50:34.978
- What do you catch mostly?
- Fish.

50:43.356 --> 50:44.789
Come on.

50:57.003 --> 50:58.527
- Hello.
- Back away from the fence.

50:58.705 --> 51:01.299
Listen, I'm from
the <i>Cape Herald,</i> all right?

51:01.475 --> 51:04.410
My wallet, my credentials,
everything got left in Freetown.

51:04.578 --> 51:07.240
We barely got out with our lives.
Can we just get through?

51:07.414 --> 51:10.440
Back away from the fence.

51:14.421 --> 51:16.082
But you are not a journalist.

51:16.256 --> 51:17.689
I'm trying to get us to Kono.

51:17.858 --> 51:20.258
- Do you understand that, huh?
- Getting B-roll. Wait.

51:20.427 --> 51:22.987
Listen, I'm coming back.
I'm coming back just now.

51:23.163 --> 51:26.223
How's it, my <i>bru?</i>
Have you got an extra smoke?

51:26.399 --> 51:28.128
- Here.
- Oh, cheers.

51:28.301 --> 51:31.327
I'm looking for someone, an American
by the name of Maddy Bowen.

51:31.505 --> 51:34.269
- If you saw her, you would not forget it.
- Yeah, I know her.

51:34.441 --> 51:35.430
- Is it?
- Yeah.

51:35.609 --> 51:39.204
Can you tell her Danny Archer's looking
for her? I've got the story she wants.

51:39.379 --> 51:42.576
Okay, but I'm going out for a bit.
If I see her before, I'll tell her.

51:42.749 --> 51:44.979
Magic. Listen, we'll be
right down the road, huh?

51:45.152 --> 51:48.019
- Sweet. Cheers, <i>bru</i>.
- Cheers.

51:49.389 --> 51:52.825
It is as I said.
You will say anything.

51:59.332 --> 52:00.993
- You don't mind waiting?
- No worries.

52:01.168 --> 52:05.036
- Thank you so much. I'll just be a sec.
- All right, Maddy.

52:08.408 --> 52:09.807
Hi.

52:09.976 --> 52:11.739
You got out.

52:11.912 --> 52:14.972
Yes. Hello again.

52:15.148 --> 52:17.480
- This is Solomon Vandy.
- Hi.

52:17.651 --> 52:19.175
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

52:19.519 --> 52:22.920
So I'm on deadline. I've been waiting
four hours to use the phone.

52:23.089 --> 52:27.389
- I've got someone holding my place in line.
- I understand. Come with me, huh?

52:28.028 --> 52:30.121
All right. Here it is.

52:30.297 --> 52:33.232
- There's a company called Tiara Diamonds.
- Right?

52:33.400 --> 52:35.698
They get the stones
that I smuggle into Liberia.

52:35.869 --> 52:38.235
Now, Van De Kaap
has no visible ties to Tiara...

52:38.405 --> 52:41.704
...but through a series of cross holdings
and offshore bank accounts...

52:41.875 --> 52:44.002
...they actually own it.
- You can prove this?

52:45.412 --> 52:48.870
- If you help me out, yeah.
- Right, here it comes.

52:49.049 --> 52:51.574
Before you say anything,
look at that man. You see him?

52:52.018 --> 52:56.614
His entire village was burned down.
His wife and children, they got away.

52:56.790 --> 52:59.987
He's been working in the mining camps,
trying to get his family back.

53:00.160 --> 53:01.752
He cannot get through the red tape.

53:01.928 --> 53:04.692
All I'm asking is this,
that you help him, huh?

53:04.865 --> 53:06.890
And how do you know this man?

53:07.534 --> 53:11.368
- I know him. I know him.
- Oh, come on, Archer.

53:11.805 --> 53:13.363
You're using him.

53:14.941 --> 53:19.207
I'm using him, and you are using me,
and this is how it works, isn't it?

53:19.379 --> 53:22.143
Come on. Look, you've got access
to U.N. Databases.

53:22.315 --> 53:24.215
- You can track his family for him.
- Why?

53:24.384 --> 53:27.547
This whole country's at war.
Why should I help just one person?

53:33.193 --> 53:35.161
I can't believe I just said that.

53:38.398 --> 53:41.026
My family's here, in Guinea?

53:41.201 --> 53:43.499
Yes, according to the manifest.

53:44.437 --> 53:46.200
I do not know how to thank you.

54:12.198 --> 54:14.894
Thank you. Thank you.

54:29.316 --> 54:31.580
This is what a million people looks like.

54:35.021 --> 54:38.855
At the moment, the second largest
refugee camp in Africa.

54:39.426 --> 54:45.126
Might catch a minute of this on CNN,
somewhere between Sports and Weather.

54:54.607 --> 54:55.938
- Hello.
- Yeah, hello?

54:56.109 --> 54:58.475
I've spoken with Colonel Coedoo...

54:58.912 --> 55:01.779
...and highlighted the names
we're looking for.

55:01.948 --> 55:03.142
- Move away.
- What him doing?

55:03.316 --> 55:04.681
Okay, I'm gonna check for you.

55:04.851 --> 55:07.376
- Wait me there.
- Okay, thank you.

55:07.721 --> 55:08.813
We are here to help you.

55:08.989 --> 55:11.253
This woman says she has
spoken to Coedoo.

55:11.424 --> 55:15.190
An entire country made homeless.

55:18.098 --> 55:21.465
Two multiplied by three
is equal to six.

55:21.634 --> 55:25.161
Two multiplied by four
is equal to eight.

55:25.338 --> 55:28.569
Two multiplied by five
is equal to 10.

55:28.742 --> 55:31.836
Two multiplied by six
is equal to 12.

56:09.849 --> 56:11.077
Jassie.

56:12.218 --> 56:13.708
Jassie!

56:14.454 --> 56:16.183
Jassie!

56:16.356 --> 56:17.516
- Jassie.
- Solo.

56:17.690 --> 56:18.918
- Jassie.
- Solo.

56:19.125 --> 56:21.457
Jassie. Jassie.

56:23.563 --> 56:25.326
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

56:34.107 --> 56:35.335
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

56:37.077 --> 56:38.874
Dia. Dia.

56:39.846 --> 56:41.108
Where is Dia?

56:44.918 --> 56:46.044
Jassie!

56:56.763 --> 56:58.993
They took him.

57:03.403 --> 57:05.394
There are only two children
on the manifest.

57:05.572 --> 57:08.097
- Where is my son?
- Oh, Christ.

57:08.374 --> 57:10.239
Where is my son?

57:10.410 --> 57:12.173
- Away from the fence.
- Where is my son?

57:12.345 --> 57:13.607
Move away from the fence.

57:13.780 --> 57:16.840
- Let them out! Let them out!
- Keep away from the fence.

57:18.251 --> 57:19.445
Let them out!

57:22.956 --> 57:23.945
Away from the fence.

57:25.925 --> 57:27.722
- They'll shoot you!
- Jassie!

57:27.894 --> 57:30.260
No! Solo!

57:30.430 --> 57:32.728
Do you want your wife and child
to watch you die?

57:33.433 --> 57:36.231
Solo! Solo!

57:45.678 --> 57:50.240
They said they're concerned that
some of the refugees might be rebels...

57:50.783 --> 57:54.514
...so they refused to release them
until there's a cease-fire.

57:55.922 --> 57:58.686
I'm so sorry, Solomon.

57:59.058 --> 58:01.720
What you want, Mr. Archer,
is beyond those hills...

58:01.895 --> 58:04.056
...where I buried it.

58:27.320 --> 58:32.223
You say the mine is on the Sewa River.
Where exactly?

58:33.359 --> 58:34.883
Solomon.

58:35.895 --> 58:37.760
I do not need a map.

58:37.931 --> 58:42.334
Yeah, well, I do.
Look, we are down here, huh?

58:42.502 --> 58:44.265
The press convoy
is on its way to Kono.

58:44.437 --> 58:47.736
You say the diamond mine is up here.
Where did you bury it?

58:51.077 --> 58:54.274
When we get to Kono,
we're gonna have to walk, all right?

58:54.447 --> 58:57.211
You damn well better be able to find it.

58:59.152 --> 59:03.384
My son is a very good student.

59:04.557 --> 59:07.185
He walks five kilometers
to the Sister School...

59:07.360 --> 59:10.727
...every morning to study English.

59:12.565 --> 59:15.625
He's going to be a doctor one day.

59:39.926 --> 59:43.828
"In the 90-degree heat,
Solomon Vandy drops to his knees...

59:43.997 --> 59:47.660
...rattling the wire
with his powerful hands."

59:51.204 --> 59:53.968
- What?
- Nothing.

59:56.075 --> 59:58.100
Do you think I'm exploiting his grief?

01:00:00.079 --> 01:00:01.842
You're right. It's shit.

01:00:02.615 --> 01:00:05.345
It's like one of those infomercials.

01:00:05.518 --> 01:00:10.353
You know, the little black babies
with swollen bellies and flies in their eyes.

01:00:10.523 --> 01:00:14.425
So here I've got dead mothers,
I've got severed limbs, but it's nothing new.

01:00:14.594 --> 01:00:17.188
It might be enough
to make people cry if they read it...

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:18.830
...maybe even write a check...

01:00:18.998 --> 01:00:21.364
...but it's not gonna be enough
to make it stop.

01:00:21.668 --> 01:00:26.230
I am sick of writing about victims,
but it's all I can fucking do.

01:00:26.406 --> 01:00:27.930
Because I need facts.

01:00:28.107 --> 01:00:32.635
I need names. I need dates.
I need pictures. I need bank accounts.

01:00:34.681 --> 01:00:37.206
People back home
wouldn't buy a ring...

01:00:37.383 --> 01:00:39.647
...if they knew it cost
someone else their hand.

01:00:40.286 --> 01:00:42.447
But I can't write that story...

01:00:42.622 --> 01:00:46.149
...until I get facts
that can be verified...

01:00:46.326 --> 01:00:51.457
...which is to say, until I find someone
who will go on record.

01:00:52.632 --> 01:00:54.156
So if that is not you...

01:00:54.334 --> 01:00:58.430
...and you're not really gonna help me,
and we're not really gonna screw...

01:00:58.604 --> 01:01:01.835
...then why don't you get the fuck
out of my face...

01:01:02.008 --> 01:01:03.908
...and let me do my work?

01:01:12.051 --> 01:01:15.987
Do you know that Solomon thinks
his son's gonna be a doctor one day?

01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:21.921
Maybe his baby dies in that camp.
Maybe his daughter gets raped.

01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:24.422
Who knows, maybe both.

01:01:26.499 --> 01:01:28.262
Do you realize that
that diamond...

01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:31.198
...is the only chance he has
of getting his family out?

01:01:31.371 --> 01:01:35.603
- You don't give a rat's ass about his family.
- Do you understand that?

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.139
Listen, I need to get to Kono, all right?

01:01:43.316 --> 01:01:45.409
The only way
is with the press convoy.

01:01:45.585 --> 01:01:47.951
I'm a journalist,
and he's my cameraman, all right?

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:49.645
- No.
- Please, Maddy.

01:01:49.822 --> 01:01:51.449
- Please.
- No!

01:02:04.771 --> 01:02:07.137
After I smuggle the stones
across the border...

01:02:08.307 --> 01:02:11.037
...local buyers get them
to a middleman in Monrovia.

01:02:14.881 --> 01:02:16.178
Go on.

01:02:17.683 --> 01:02:22.552
<i>He pays off Customs and then certifies</i>
<i>that the diamonds were mined in Liberia.</i>

01:02:22.722 --> 01:02:25.088
That way, they can be legally exported.

01:02:25.658 --> 01:02:28.752
Now, once they've reached
the buyers in Antwerp...

01:02:28.928 --> 01:02:31.419
<i>... diamonds are brought</i>
<i>to the sorting tables...</i>

01:02:31.597 --> 01:02:33.189
<i>... no more questions are asked.</i>

01:02:34.367 --> 01:02:36.130
By the time they get to India...

01:02:36.302 --> 01:02:40.033
<i>... the dirty stones are mixed with</i>
<i>the clean stones from all over the world...</i>

01:02:40.206 --> 01:02:42.470
...and then they become
like any other diamonds.

01:02:42.642 --> 01:02:44.837
And Van De Kaap
knows about all this?

01:02:46.446 --> 01:02:47.504
Yeah.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.342
<i>When I get to London,</i>
<i>I meet with Simmons.</i>

01:02:50.783 --> 01:02:54.219
Supply and demand. You control the supply,
and you keep the demand high.

01:02:54.387 --> 01:02:55.854
- Agreed.
- Good.

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:58.388
Now, there's an underground vault...

01:02:58.558 --> 01:03:02.119
<i>... where they put all the stones</i>
<i>they buy up to keep off the market...</i>

01:03:02.295 --> 01:03:04.126
<i>... so they can keep the price high.</i>

01:03:04.897 --> 01:03:08.298
If rebels wanna flood the market
with a billion dollars' worth of rough...

01:03:08.468 --> 01:03:11.528
...a company like Van De Kaap,
who says that they're rare...

01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:13.365
...can't afford to let that happen.

01:03:13.539 --> 01:03:15.803
<i>Especially when they're telling</i>
<i>some poor sod...</i>

01:03:15.975 --> 01:03:18.466
<i>... he's supposed to shell out</i>
<i>three months' salary...</i>

01:03:18.644 --> 01:03:19.975
<i>... for an engagement ring.</i>

01:03:20.146 --> 01:03:23.138
Now, technically speaking,
they're not financing the war...

01:03:23.316 --> 01:03:26.149
...but creating a situation
where it pays to keep it going.

01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:29.550
- You understand?
- Yes. And where's my proof?

01:03:36.028 --> 01:03:40.158
Names, dates and numbered accounts.

01:03:42.268 --> 01:03:45.328
You publish one word of this story
before I give them the stone...

01:03:45.505 --> 01:03:47.530
...and I'm dead, huh?

01:03:47.707 --> 01:03:52.076
After I give it to them,
then... I leave this continent forever.

01:03:54.313 --> 01:03:56.110
If you don't come out
with the diamond?

01:03:56.282 --> 01:03:58.682
Then write whatever you want.

01:03:59.519 --> 01:04:01.612
I'm already dead.

01:04:08.461 --> 01:04:12.124
Now, remember. All you say is,
"I am the cameraman," all right?

01:04:12.298 --> 01:04:14.232
Listen, I cannot do this.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.028
- Why not?
- Because I am not a journalist.

01:04:17.203 --> 01:04:19.694
- Of course you're not.
- Well, then how can I say I am?

01:04:19.872 --> 01:04:23.069
Because you do. Because that's how
you get your son back, all right?

01:04:23.242 --> 01:04:25.642
Now get on the bus. Go.

01:04:42.328 --> 01:04:45.229
I am the cameraman.

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:53.331
You are writing about
what is happening here?

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.129
Yes.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:59.506
So when people in your country read it,
they will come help us, yes?

01:05:00.246 --> 01:05:01.304
Probably not.

01:05:02.915 --> 01:05:05.281
- You heard of a Stinger?
- What?

01:05:05.451 --> 01:05:09.911
Your friend, Maddy. She's like a full-on,
heat-seeking missile, <i>bru</i>.

01:05:10.089 --> 01:05:12.785
I mean, I saw her go into Afghanistan...

01:05:12.959 --> 01:05:16.087
...like about 200 clicks
into Taliban land.

01:05:16.262 --> 01:05:19.095
When the military said no,
she just took a bus, <i>bru</i>.

01:05:19.265 --> 01:05:22.564
Came back with 3000 words,
and she still looked so good.

01:05:22.735 --> 01:05:24.600
- Like hot, you know?
- All right.

01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:26.499
Calm down to the frantic now, huh?

01:05:28.107 --> 01:05:29.938
- What's that?
- What's going on?

01:05:31.077 --> 01:05:32.305
Looks like it was an RPG.

01:05:32.478 --> 01:05:34.309
Open the door. Let us out.

01:05:34.647 --> 01:05:36.581
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on. Go, go, go.

01:05:38.551 --> 01:05:40.018
Go, go! Move, move, move!

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:43.721
We've just happened upon
the sight of an ambush...

01:05:44.857 --> 01:05:47.189
...fifteen kilometers
from the Liberian border...

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.988
...near the Moa River...
- As you can see behind me...

01:05:50.162 --> 01:05:51.686
...just a few minutes ago...

01:05:51.864 --> 01:05:54.196
...an ambulance has...
- Got movement in the bush.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.425
- Check out the head of the road.
- Spread out.

01:05:56.602 --> 01:05:58.331
- At this site.
Dozens of...

01:05:59.338 --> 01:06:01.272
Many are injured.

01:06:11.417 --> 01:06:14.580
Get back on the bus, huh?
Get back on! Come on!

01:06:14.754 --> 01:06:16.381
- Maddy!
- Move it! Move it!

01:06:16.555 --> 01:06:17.544
Get back on the bus!

01:06:17.723 --> 01:06:19.281
Solomon! Solomon!

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:20.948
- Let's go.
- Solomon, come here!

01:06:21.127 --> 01:06:22.560
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, come on.

01:06:22.762 --> 01:06:25.424
- Get in the bus!
- Move, move, move! Come on, come on.

01:06:25.765 --> 01:06:27.596
- Move!
- Get in the bus. Let's go.

01:06:27.767 --> 01:06:29.962
Get in, get in.
Goddamn it, get in! Get in!

01:06:30.136 --> 01:06:32.570
- Let me inside!
- There's no fucking space!

01:06:32.738 --> 01:06:35.002
- Let them on the bus.
- You give him your seat.

01:06:35.174 --> 01:06:38.143
What if we just take your place, huh?
What if we take your place?

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:41.245
That's enough. He can ride with me.
Oi, he can ride with me.

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:43.974
Maddy! Let's go!
Maddy, let's go. Come on!

01:06:56.896 --> 01:07:00.024
Nothing like a little bang-bang
to get the heart started, Maddy.

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:04.097
- Whatever you say, Corbauld.
- Come on, love. Don't be like that.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:07.728
Story's played out, hasn't it?
Government bad, rebels worse.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.708
No one gives a toss anymore.
Know what I mean?

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:48.413
<i>This medicine will make you strong...</i>

01:07:48.948 --> 01:07:51.348
...make you invisible to your enemies.

01:07:51.517 --> 01:07:53.747
Bullets will bounce off you.

01:08:04.563 --> 01:08:08.329
Superboy Killer, yes, huh?
Commando.

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.436
Foreigners are the cause of the problems.

01:08:14.039 --> 01:08:17.872
Poppy Sankoh say,
"Overthrow those who would exploit you."

01:08:19.745 --> 01:08:21.234
I am Baby Killer.

01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:28.680
- I am the Master of Disaster.
- You will be strong.

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:33.457
I am Born Trouble.

01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:41.924
I am See Me No More.

01:08:51.477 --> 01:08:54.412
You'd think they'd want
at least one decent road in this place.

01:08:55.848 --> 01:08:59.978
I'm gonna have to start charging
an entrance fee. Oh, God!

01:09:29.849 --> 01:09:31.077
Get down!

01:09:39.191 --> 01:09:41.421
- Look out!
- Shit!

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:55.497
- You all right?
- Fine.

01:10:01.146 --> 01:10:02.443
Shit!

01:10:05.551 --> 01:10:06.882
Hold on!

01:10:16.996 --> 01:10:18.395
Hold on!

01:10:29.675 --> 01:10:30.903
Come on.

01:10:38.417 --> 01:10:40.612
- Everyone all right, huh?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:42.252
Let me see that. You okay?

01:10:42.421 --> 01:10:43.479
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:10:46.125 --> 01:10:49.117
Quietly, now. Quietly.

01:11:10.282 --> 01:11:11.715
Come on.

01:11:32.935 --> 01:11:37.099
Kamajors. Local militia
protecting their homes, huh?

01:11:37.273 --> 01:11:39.138
- Do not look them in the eye.
- No.

01:11:53.623 --> 01:11:55.113
Excuse me. Excuse me?

01:11:56.058 --> 01:11:59.425
Hi, I'm Maddy Bowen
with <i>Vital Affairs</i> magazine.

01:11:59.595 --> 01:12:02.655
Wonder if I could take your picture.
I'm just gonna get my camera.

01:12:02.832 --> 01:12:05.767
I've heard about your struggle.
I'd love to know more about it.

01:12:05.935 --> 01:12:08.563
Would you mind if I took your picture?
Everyone together?

01:12:08.905 --> 01:12:10.668
Everyone could all come in together.

01:12:14.176 --> 01:12:16.201
Is that okay?
If everyone could come closer.

01:12:17.246 --> 01:12:20.340
If you come over here and come in
nice and close. That's good.

01:12:20.516 --> 01:12:23.974
Yeah. That's great.
And we'll get one with all of us.

01:12:24.253 --> 01:12:26.050
There you go. That's perfect.

01:12:27.857 --> 01:12:30.382
How about one together?
Us together, what do you think?

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.528
I'll come in like this, yeah?

01:12:33.329 --> 01:12:34.318
Cheese.

01:12:36.499 --> 01:12:38.831
So do you think
they've read your work?

01:12:39.001 --> 01:12:41.128
Shut up.

01:12:54.016 --> 01:12:56.348
Hey, get them, get them, get them.

01:12:57.987 --> 01:13:01.684
- I got a score. I got a score.
- You missed.

01:13:02.391 --> 01:13:04.552
Where have you come from?

01:13:05.127 --> 01:13:07.857
- Where did you come from?
- Where have you come from?

01:13:08.965 --> 01:13:11.798
That's right. Yeah.
From New York. From America.

01:13:11.968 --> 01:13:13.868
I don't have anything for you.

01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:35.987
My name is Benjamin Margai.

01:13:36.692 --> 01:13:38.751
Danny Archer. This is Maddy Bowen.

01:13:38.928 --> 01:13:41.988
- Hello. How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

01:13:56.812 --> 01:13:59.110
I'm the cameraman?

01:14:01.717 --> 01:14:04.652
The Belgians were the first
to chop off limbs in Africa.

01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:09.189
King Leopold took one hand
for every hundredth slave in the Congo...

01:14:09.358 --> 01:14:11.451
...to keep them in line.

01:14:12.094 --> 01:14:15.029
Many of these children
were taken by the RUF.

01:14:15.197 --> 01:14:17.188
We have taken them back.

01:14:17.366 --> 01:14:20.460
Some of them have been
made to do horrible things.

01:14:20.636 --> 01:14:23.662
We are trying
to bring them back to life.

01:14:23.839 --> 01:14:25.466
Let me show you.

01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:29.808
Imagine doing all this, huh?

01:14:31.113 --> 01:14:33.013
What's your excuse?

01:14:33.816 --> 01:14:39.152
Well, it's gotten hard to go back
to sipping lattes and talking interest rates.

01:14:39.388 --> 01:14:42.016
So you're an action junkie, huh?

01:14:42.958 --> 01:14:45.256
Three out of five ex-boyfriends
recently polled...

01:14:45.428 --> 01:14:49.865
...say that I prefer to be
in a constant state of crisis.

01:14:50.399 --> 01:14:52.663
Maybe I just give a shit.

01:14:56.338 --> 01:14:57.327
You were good today.

01:14:59.775 --> 01:15:01.106
You know that?

01:15:02.244 --> 01:15:03.734
You too.

01:15:06.682 --> 01:15:09.617
"...that sometimes they forgot
to close the door.

01:15:09.785 --> 01:15:12.845
She also wrote
about her sister Josie...

01:15:13.456 --> 01:15:18.450
...who was very ill
and who had to be taken to hospital."

01:15:20.496 --> 01:15:21.690
Cheers.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.094
So how many attacks
have there been in the area?

01:15:27.269 --> 01:15:30.170
I have known most of the rebels
since they were children.

01:15:30.339 --> 01:15:34.867
The local commander is still afraid
I will come after him with my ruler.

01:15:36.312 --> 01:15:39.770
So you think because your intentions
are good, they'll spare you, huh?

01:15:39.949 --> 01:15:42.782
My heart always told me
that people are inherently good.

01:15:42.952 --> 01:15:45.147
My experience suggests otherwise.

01:15:45.321 --> 01:15:47.118
But what about you, Mr. Archer?

01:15:47.556 --> 01:15:49.990
In your long career as a journalist...

01:15:50.159 --> 01:15:52.992
...would you say that people
are mostly good?

01:15:55.064 --> 01:15:56.497
No.

01:15:56.766 --> 01:15:58.290
I'd say they're just people.

01:15:58.467 --> 01:16:02.403
Exactly. It is what they do
that makes them good or bad.

01:16:02.571 --> 01:16:05.802
A moment of love,
even in a bad man...

01:16:06.075 --> 01:16:08.543
...can give meaning to a life.

01:16:08.711 --> 01:16:12.340
None of us knows which path
will lead us to God.

01:16:15.084 --> 01:16:16.574
Hey!

01:17:04.567 --> 01:17:06.432
It's palm wine.

01:17:15.711 --> 01:17:18.646
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, yeah. It takes getting used to, huh?

01:17:18.814 --> 01:17:20.304
God.

01:17:20.482 --> 01:17:23.212
- Drank that as a boy.
- In Rhodesia?

01:17:25.387 --> 01:17:26.615
I take notes.

01:17:29.325 --> 01:17:31.054
The Shona...

01:17:32.361 --> 01:17:34.659
The Shona have a word for me.

01:17:36.498 --> 01:17:40.127
- It means "white boy in Africa."
- When did you leave?

01:17:40.769 --> 01:17:42.464
I didn't leave.

01:17:42.638 --> 01:17:46.972
I got sent away to South Africa
in 1978 when the <i>munts</i> overran us.

01:17:47.309 --> 01:17:48.776
Then you joined the army?

01:17:51.647 --> 01:17:53.808
Yeah. Yeah, I did my time in Angola.

01:17:53.983 --> 01:17:56.679
- The 32 Battalion.
- That's right.

01:17:59.054 --> 01:18:02.319
You know, contrary to what
you might think about us...

01:18:02.491 --> 01:18:05.983
...we fought with the blacks, huh?
Yeah. Side by side.

01:18:06.161 --> 01:18:09.892
There was no apartheid in a foxhole.
The colonel always used to tell us that.

01:18:10.065 --> 01:18:13.466
- This is Colonel Coetzee?
- Yeah.

01:18:15.704 --> 01:18:19.105
Then, of course, it's 1994.
No more army.

01:18:19.275 --> 01:18:21.106
No more apartheid.

01:18:21.277 --> 01:18:24.644
Truth and reconciliation
and all of that rubbish, you know.

01:18:24.813 --> 01:18:26.303
Kumbaya.

01:18:27.082 --> 01:18:29.846
We fought and died together,
you know?

01:18:30.019 --> 01:18:33.284
Black and white. Most people back home
didn't even know we were at war.

01:18:33.455 --> 01:18:35.320
We thought we were
fighting Communism...

01:18:35.491 --> 01:18:39.359
...but in the end, it was all about
who gets what, you know?

01:18:39.528 --> 01:18:42.588
Lvory, oil, gold:

01:18:43.532 --> 01:18:45.295
Diamonds.

01:18:48.537 --> 01:18:51.506
So one day I decided,
"Fuck it," you know?

01:18:52.141 --> 01:18:53.699
"I'm gonna get mine."

01:18:53.876 --> 01:18:55.468
You gonna steal his diamond?

01:19:02.985 --> 01:19:06.682
That diamond is my ticket
out of this godforsaken continent.

01:19:06.889 --> 01:19:08.720
That doesn't answer the question.

01:19:19.368 --> 01:19:23.464
My dad came home
from the war in '69.

01:19:25.741 --> 01:19:27.606
And it took him...

01:19:28.744 --> 01:19:30.837
...about 20 years to get right.

01:19:32.715 --> 01:19:34.012
What?

01:19:36.885 --> 01:19:41.185
You Americans love to talk
about your feelings, huh?

01:19:41.357 --> 01:19:43.621
So, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

01:19:43.792 --> 01:19:45.919
- Got a thing for messed-up vets now?
- Shut up.

01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:49.397
You lost both your parents.

01:19:50.299 --> 01:19:53.132
That's a polite way
of putting it, yeah.

01:19:55.771 --> 01:19:58.103
Mom was raped and shot...

01:20:00.943 --> 01:20:04.037
...and Dad was decapitated
and hung from a hook in the barn.

01:20:05.581 --> 01:20:07.310
I was 9.

01:20:10.919 --> 01:20:12.511
Boohoo, right?

01:20:16.258 --> 01:20:18.385
Sometimes I wonder...

01:20:21.497 --> 01:20:24.557
...will God ever forgive us
for what we've done to each other?

01:20:28.203 --> 01:20:31.070
Then I look around and I realize...

01:20:31.974 --> 01:20:35.432
...God left this place a long time ago.

01:20:42.151 --> 01:20:44.176
It's...

01:20:46.455 --> 01:20:48.389
What's the point, huh?

01:21:31.834 --> 01:21:33.859
Oh, shit. Keep moving, huh?

01:21:34.036 --> 01:21:35.799
- What?
- Drive at them. They'll panic.

01:21:35.971 --> 01:21:38.235
Do you know where the word
"infantry" comes from?

01:21:38.407 --> 01:21:41.706
It means "child soldier."
They are just children.

01:21:41.877 --> 01:21:45.540
- Stop! Stop! RUF on the road!
- Hi. Hello. Hello.

01:21:46.782 --> 01:21:47.840
Hello, little brothers.

01:21:48.016 --> 01:21:50.541
- RUF on the road!
- Yeah, yeah. What is your names?

01:21:51.053 --> 01:21:53.351
I'm Dead Body.
Who is this motherfucker?

01:21:53.522 --> 01:21:55.183
We are teachers on our way to Kono.

01:21:55.357 --> 01:21:57.587
Only RUF on the road.

01:21:57.759 --> 01:21:59.693
- RUF only!
- Yes, yes, I understand that.

01:21:59.895 --> 01:22:01.226
- Only RUF!
- But son, this is...

01:22:03.499 --> 01:22:05.091
Don't move! Don't move! Fuck.

01:22:07.336 --> 01:22:10.669
Jesus Christ! Maddy, press your hand
against the exit wound there, huh?

01:22:10.839 --> 01:22:13.137
- Got it.
- Keep it there, huh?

01:22:13.308 --> 01:22:15.071
Whatever you do,
don't talk, all right?

01:22:15.244 --> 01:22:17.075
Is there any wine left in that jug?

01:22:17.246 --> 01:22:19.111
- Here.
- Pour it all over everything, huh?

01:22:20.649 --> 01:22:23.584
The colonel's gonna have a medic
at the airstrip in Kono.

01:22:23.752 --> 01:22:26.744
- How far is it?
- You said not to talk.

01:22:27.022 --> 01:22:28.216
A comedian, huh?

01:22:42.404 --> 01:22:44.804
- How's his pulse?
- I can feel it sometimes.

01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:58.219
- Hold it right there.
- Stop.

01:22:58.387 --> 01:22:59.615
Papers, please.

01:23:03.792 --> 01:23:05.020
Excuse me.

01:23:05.194 --> 01:23:08.129
I was just trying
to keep pressure on the wound.

01:23:08.297 --> 01:23:10.822
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- You'll be all right, huh?

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:12.797
Will you?

01:23:13.502 --> 01:23:16.494
I'll check on him in the tent
in a little bit. Thank you.

01:23:16.738 --> 01:23:18.069
Hey.

01:23:18.607 --> 01:23:20.598
Look who's alive, eh?

01:23:20.776 --> 01:23:22.107
I told the H you'd be back.

01:23:24.079 --> 01:23:27.014
I'm afraid we're evacuating
all non-military personnel, miss.

01:23:27.182 --> 01:23:29.013
Transport touches down at 1600.

01:23:29.184 --> 01:23:30.947
She's with me, all right?

01:23:31.153 --> 01:23:34.816
No exceptions, pal. This is gonna be ugly.
Colonel doesn't want an audience.

01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:37.788
Is I.R.'s presence here
known to other African nations?

01:23:39.294 --> 01:23:41.319
- She's with you?
- Yeah.

01:23:42.464 --> 01:23:44.329
Come on. The colonel's this way.

01:23:44.499 --> 01:23:46.330
Give me a minute, huh?

01:23:49.504 --> 01:23:52.029
We block their escape
by blowing the bridge.

01:23:53.675 --> 01:23:55.370
That's correct.

01:23:56.111 --> 01:23:58.409
You made it out. Well done.

01:23:58.614 --> 01:24:00.548
Negative, Kilo Foxtrot, stand by.

01:24:01.216 --> 01:24:04.879
- Colonel, sir.
- So must be real, then.

01:24:06.054 --> 01:24:07.248
The pink.

01:24:07.756 --> 01:24:10.350
Well, you're part
of this operation now.

01:24:10.525 --> 01:24:14.017
First we snuff everything that moves
out there, then we find your diamond.

01:24:14.196 --> 01:24:15.823
Colonel?

01:24:16.365 --> 01:24:18.799
Go get kitted. Yes?

01:24:25.107 --> 01:24:27.098
Move, move, move!

01:24:27.309 --> 01:24:30.574
- Go get your kit.
- Will do, chum. Will do.

01:24:34.116 --> 01:24:37.279
It's go time, all right?
Meet me behind the tents.

01:24:40.389 --> 01:24:42.084
How's Benjamin?

01:24:42.257 --> 01:24:43.724
They say he'll live.

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:46.322
Good. Good.

01:24:53.735 --> 01:24:55.532
Listen, Maddy...

01:24:56.938 --> 01:24:58.701
...I need you to do me one last favor.

01:24:59.741 --> 01:25:01.106
Yeah?

01:25:03.078 --> 01:25:04.739
Tell that guard
you wanna put him...

01:25:04.913 --> 01:25:07.575
...on the cover of <i>Soldier of Fortune</i>
magazine for me.

01:25:13.622 --> 01:25:14.850
You're going in.

01:25:19.261 --> 01:25:21.525
You and Solomon.

01:25:23.699 --> 01:25:24.688
You're going in now.

01:25:25.534 --> 01:25:27.729
Your plane leaves
in a few minutes, huh?

01:25:30.339 --> 01:25:32.307
You're an idiot.

01:25:36.611 --> 01:25:39.478
- What if I wanted to go in with you?
- I'd say no.

01:25:39.648 --> 01:25:41.639
- What if I insist?
- I'd insist back.

01:25:47.756 --> 01:25:48.950
It's my story.

01:25:49.124 --> 01:25:52.525
Your story is Van De Kaap, all right?
That stone is mine.

01:25:52.694 --> 01:25:56.130
I'm not leaving here without it,
you understand?

01:25:57.599 --> 01:26:00.466
Please, just give me two minutes.

01:26:17.219 --> 01:26:18.618
Yeah.

01:26:29.931 --> 01:26:31.626
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.031
My name is Maddy Bowen.
I'm with <i>Vital Affairs</i> magazine.

01:26:35.203 --> 01:26:37.671
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

01:26:37.839 --> 01:26:39.363
Well, that depends what they are.

01:26:39.541 --> 01:26:43.500
Oh, I see you're familiar
with our devious ways, aren't you?

01:26:44.246 --> 01:26:46.146
Okay, so I'll start
with something simple.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:01.422
And before that you were with
the South African Defense...?

01:27:01.596 --> 01:27:03.257
- Defense Force, correct.
- Of course.

01:27:03.432 --> 01:27:06.868
And was that with Colonel Coetzee?
Were you in Angola?

01:27:07.035 --> 01:27:08.559
Angola, yeah.

01:27:10.172 --> 01:27:13.141
That is all I really need to know.
Thank you so much.

01:27:13.341 --> 01:27:14.808
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:26.219
Thank you, huh?

01:27:26.388 --> 01:27:28.822
Just keeping my end of the deal.

01:27:29.424 --> 01:27:30.721
Good luck to you, Solomon.

01:27:31.026 --> 01:27:32.516
Okay.

01:27:33.695 --> 01:27:37.529
- I hope you find what you're looking for.
- Thank you for all you have done.

01:27:44.973 --> 01:27:47.567
- Listen, I...
- No, you listen.

01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:54.080
In another life maybe, all right?

01:27:55.517 --> 01:27:57.348
Yeah. Sure.

01:27:57.519 --> 01:27:58.884
Yeah.

01:28:03.225 --> 01:28:05.352
You find yourself a good man,
all right, Maddy?

01:28:11.299 --> 01:28:14.325
You know, I've got three sisters.

01:28:14.503 --> 01:28:17.131
They're all married to good men.

01:28:19.007 --> 01:28:20.065
I prefer my life.

01:28:22.711 --> 01:28:27.171
Here is my office phone...

01:28:27.349 --> 01:28:29.715
...home phone, cell phone.

01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:34.983
I'm used to being pursued,
but what the heck.

01:28:46.167 --> 01:28:48.294
You better get on that plane, huh?

01:28:50.038 --> 01:28:51.938
You should get on that plane.

01:29:00.115 --> 01:29:01.912
So should you.

01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:09.516
You gonna call me?

01:29:13.328 --> 01:29:14.818
Soon as I'm near a phone, yeah.

01:29:15.764 --> 01:29:18.130
Yeah, right.

01:29:39.955 --> 01:29:43.220
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:29:47.796 --> 01:29:49.388
Oh, shit.

01:29:49.664 --> 01:29:52.394
Nabil? Yeah, I'll call you
when we get closer, all right?

01:29:52.567 --> 01:29:55.161
You keep me posted. Right.

01:29:55.337 --> 01:29:59.137
All right. I set the pace, huh?
Two-hour marches, five-minute breaks.

01:29:59.307 --> 01:30:03.141
If I hold my hand up like this, you stop.
If I point to the dirt, you lie flat.

01:30:03.311 --> 01:30:06.872
If I say go, you move like your life
depended on it. Understood?

01:30:07.048 --> 01:30:09.710
- Yes, boss.
- Come on.

01:30:19.995 --> 01:30:21.656
Tell me about the stone.

01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:24.458
Is it clear or is it milky?

01:30:24.633 --> 01:30:26.157
Clear.

01:30:26.334 --> 01:30:28.734
And the color, is it strong?

01:30:28.903 --> 01:30:30.131
Does it hold the light?

01:30:30.305 --> 01:30:32.364
It is as you say.

01:30:32.807 --> 01:30:35.970
- About the size of a bird's egg?
- Yes.

01:30:36.144 --> 01:30:40.308
One hundred carats.
Come on, let's pick up the pace.

01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:23.255
Dia!

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.128
Stop the truck!

01:31:27.896 --> 01:31:29.591
I thought it was Dia.

01:32:23.518 --> 01:32:25.076
Wake up.

01:32:26.921 --> 01:32:30.015
Don't worry, they're gone, huh?

01:32:31.359 --> 01:32:34.487
You know, I once had this buddy...

01:32:34.662 --> 01:32:36.527
...named Mabhoko.

01:32:37.298 --> 01:32:40.529
We used to hunt bush meat
together as kids, huh?

01:32:41.336 --> 01:32:42.701
Baboons.

01:32:42.871 --> 01:32:45.738
Baboons, they were
the hardest to catch. They're...

01:32:46.841 --> 01:32:48.172
They're cunning.

01:32:48.343 --> 01:32:50.436
Cunning creatures.

01:32:50.712 --> 01:32:53.340
Fast, strong.

01:32:53.515 --> 01:32:55.745
Got good eyesight.

01:32:56.251 --> 01:33:00.278
We would always find them
by the smell of their shit.

01:33:00.455 --> 01:33:05.586
And that's how we learned to track
your black terrorists in Angola, huh?

01:33:09.664 --> 01:33:11.097
By the smell of your shit.

01:33:12.133 --> 01:33:13.600
It's not...

01:33:13.768 --> 01:33:16.498
It's not the same as a baboon's.

01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:22.301
But, you know, after you skin it...

01:33:23.611 --> 01:33:25.841
...the flesh of a baboon...

01:33:26.114 --> 01:33:28.514
...isn't that much different
than a man's, you know.

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:35.856
I'll tell you, I can track anything.

01:33:48.102 --> 01:33:50.263
You risk my life like that again...

01:33:55.643 --> 01:33:57.770
...and I'll peel your face
back off your head.

01:34:00.281 --> 01:34:02.545
Do you understand?

01:34:10.792 --> 01:34:12.851
Make us a fire.

01:35:23.131 --> 01:35:24.723
What'd he say?

01:35:24.899 --> 01:35:27.026
We are going the right way.

01:35:34.175 --> 01:35:36.905
Hold up there, my man.
It's this way, huh?

01:35:38.379 --> 01:35:40.574
Where do you think you are going?

01:35:42.250 --> 01:35:43.911
Stop!

01:35:44.185 --> 01:35:45.880
I said, stop!

01:35:46.321 --> 01:35:47.879
He is not down there, all right?

01:35:49.924 --> 01:35:53.587
All right. You're gonna need
some of that old discipline, huh?

01:35:53.761 --> 01:35:56.025
Now you listen here, my boy,
and you listen well.

01:35:56.197 --> 01:35:58.165
You are not going down there.
Are we clear?

01:35:58.333 --> 01:35:59.960
You are not the master.

01:36:00.134 --> 01:36:03.763
Right now, that is exactly what I am,
and you'd better remember it, Kaffir!

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:20.251
Don't you fucking move, huh?

01:36:20.421 --> 01:36:22.389
Don't you move. Don't you move, huh?

01:36:22.557 --> 01:36:24.889
- My son is there!
- Your son is gone!

01:36:25.059 --> 01:36:26.390
- He is alive!
- He's gone!

01:36:26.561 --> 01:36:29.121
He's alive! He's there
with those crazy people!

01:36:30.331 --> 01:36:33.767
I am his father! His father!
I should have protected him!

01:36:34.235 --> 01:36:38.137
I must go find him.
I cannot live without knowing!

01:36:38.306 --> 01:36:40.536
Shoot me if you want, but I'm going.

01:36:42.643 --> 01:36:46.101
Why should it matter,
I'm dead already.

01:36:53.955 --> 01:36:56.219
We wait until dark, huh?

01:37:25.386 --> 01:37:26.785
Are you satisfied?

01:37:29.757 --> 01:37:32.282
All right, come on.

01:37:37.031 --> 01:37:39.226
<i>- Is fighting for Sierra Leone</i>

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.460
<i>RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone</i>

01:37:42.637 --> 01:37:45.572
<i>Go tell my parents</i>
<i>They may see me no more</i>

01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:48.800
<i>In the battlefield</i>
<i>We're fighting forever</i>

01:37:48.976 --> 01:37:51.877
<i>Go tell my parents</i>
<i>They may see me no more</i>

01:37:52.046 --> 01:37:53.513
<i>In the battlefield...</i>

01:37:56.084 --> 01:37:58.052
You are how old?

01:37:58.219 --> 01:37:59.982
Me? I'm 31.

01:38:00.154 --> 01:38:02.315
And you have no wife?

01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:05.657
- No.
- No children?

01:38:06.828 --> 01:38:08.125
No.

01:38:08.296 --> 01:38:09.923
And no home?

01:38:10.098 --> 01:38:11.759
No.

01:38:12.467 --> 01:38:14.867
But you have money, yes?

01:38:15.036 --> 01:38:17.300
Yeah, some.

01:38:17.472 --> 01:38:19.463
But not enough?

01:38:21.976 --> 01:38:23.534
No.

01:38:24.278 --> 01:38:28.772
If you get this diamond,
you will have enough money, yes?

01:38:30.918 --> 01:38:31.942
Yes.

01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:34.918
Then you will get
a wife and children?

01:38:35.089 --> 01:38:36.488
Probably not, no.

01:38:38.559 --> 01:38:39.548
What?

01:38:41.662 --> 01:38:43.186
What?

01:38:43.598 --> 01:38:45.657
I am confused.

01:38:46.734 --> 01:38:48.201
Yeah?

01:38:48.369 --> 01:38:51.167
That makes two of us, my <i>bru</i>.

01:38:53.674 --> 01:38:57.166
Oh, Christ.
I've gotta quit smoking, huh?

01:38:57.778 --> 01:38:59.746
Why don't you?

01:39:00.014 --> 01:39:02.414
I'll tell you what, Solomon.

01:39:02.683 --> 01:39:07.211
You find me this diamond,
and I'll quit right then and there, huh?

01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:17.621
- You were born in Zimbabwe?
- Oh, yeah.

01:39:17.798 --> 01:39:20.961
- Is it beautiful there?
- Sure you're not a reporter?

01:39:21.369 --> 01:39:24.827
Because you ask a hell of a lot
of questions, my man.

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:36.177
My grandfather told
many stories of war.

01:39:36.417 --> 01:39:39.250
How the Mende fought the Temne.

01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:43.151
Or how two tribes would fight
when somebody had stolen a woman.

01:39:53.234 --> 01:39:56.601
I understand white people
want our diamonds, yes?

01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:03.371
But how can my own people
do this to each other?

01:40:11.652 --> 01:40:13.711
I know good people...

01:40:13.888 --> 01:40:16.755
...who say there is something
wrong with us...

01:40:17.124 --> 01:40:18.284
...inside our black skin.

01:40:18.459 --> 01:40:21.792
That we were better off
when the white man ruled.

01:40:23.698 --> 01:40:26.496
But my son is good.

01:40:28.069 --> 01:40:30.264
And when he grows up...

01:40:30.438 --> 01:40:31.666
...and peace comes...

01:40:35.676 --> 01:40:38.338
...this place will be a paradise.

01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:48.688
We'll get your son back, huh?

01:41:30.398 --> 01:41:32.730
Where is it exactly?

01:41:34.268 --> 01:41:37.169
Through the camp, by the river.

01:41:41.776 --> 01:41:43.471
Christ.

01:41:43.944 --> 01:41:45.571
Okay.

01:41:46.213 --> 01:41:48.078
I'm gonna make contact
with the colonel.

01:41:48.249 --> 01:41:49.773
He'll send in an air strike.

01:41:50.217 --> 01:41:53.186
- What is that?
- A chopper, huh? An attack helicopter.

01:41:53.354 --> 01:41:55.879
- We use it as a diversion.
- What if my son is there?

01:41:56.057 --> 01:41:57.354
- He isn't.
- How do you know?

01:41:57.525 --> 01:42:01.120
I said we do it my way now, all right?
Don't fuck with me.

01:42:11.038 --> 01:42:13.438
Cordell, it's Danny.

01:42:13.607 --> 01:42:15.939
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up and listen, all right?

01:42:16.110 --> 01:42:18.977
You tell the colonel I've found the stone.

01:42:19.146 --> 01:42:22.115
No, I haven't got it in my hands,
but I'm OP-ing its location.

01:42:22.283 --> 01:42:23.875
It's a major rebel camp, my man.

01:42:24.051 --> 01:42:26.417
You tell him to send in the dakadak.

01:42:26.987 --> 01:42:29.854
Because I stole a GPS, that's how.

01:42:30.024 --> 01:42:32.584
If you shut up and listen,
I could give the coordinates.

01:42:33.027 --> 01:42:36.053
Zero-nine-zero-five-four-two-four, north.

01:42:36.230 --> 01:42:40.792
Three-two-seven-two-nine
three-zero-five-zero, east.

01:42:40.968 --> 01:42:43.232
I'll call back at midnight to confirm.

01:42:46.006 --> 01:42:48.941
You can look all night,
my friend, right?

01:42:49.110 --> 01:42:51.772
I promise you he is not there.

01:42:57.017 --> 01:42:59.212
They're coming in the morning, all right?

01:42:59.387 --> 01:43:01.821
No movement, my friend. You stay still.

01:43:03.758 --> 01:43:06.192
When it gets dark,
then we move in closer.

01:43:28.349 --> 01:43:31.341
Solomon. Shit.

01:43:42.129 --> 01:43:43.528
I can do it.

01:43:43.697 --> 01:43:44.789
- Help me.
- Help him.

01:43:44.965 --> 01:43:47.024
Thank you, Papa.

01:44:28.976 --> 01:44:31.206
Hey, you smell.

01:44:32.413 --> 01:44:33.880
That's fine.

01:44:46.193 --> 01:44:48.161
- Ready? I'm winning.
- Okay, let's go.

01:44:48.329 --> 01:44:49.990
Play, man.

01:44:51.565 --> 01:44:54.466
- Play. Play the card.
- Play.

01:45:21.262 --> 01:45:22.388
Dia.

01:45:25.432 --> 01:45:27.127
Leave me alone.

01:45:28.168 --> 01:45:31.399
- Dia. I'm your papa. Come with me.
- Hey.

01:45:31.572 --> 01:45:33.301
- Dia.
- Get away from me.

01:45:33.474 --> 01:45:35.271
- Dia. Dia!
- I do not know you. Traitor!

01:45:35.643 --> 01:45:38.134
- Enemy! Enemy!
- What the hell are you doing?

01:45:38.312 --> 01:45:39.540
- What are you doing?
- I don't know you!

01:45:39.713 --> 01:45:41.010
- What's wrong?
- I hate you!

01:45:41.181 --> 01:45:42.910
- Dia, come with me!
- I hate you!

01:45:43.083 --> 01:45:44.607
Get away from me!

01:45:47.087 --> 01:45:48.952
- Get him!
- Don't shoot!

01:45:49.456 --> 01:45:51.686
- Don't shoot! Don't...! Don't shoot!
- I hate you!

01:45:51.859 --> 01:45:53.759
- Fisherman! Traitor!
- Don't shoot!

01:45:53.928 --> 01:45:56.158
Get away from me!

01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:05.431
I knew you would come back.

01:46:05.906 --> 01:46:09.398
I have dug and dug and dug,
but I've found nothing.

01:46:09.577 --> 01:46:11.477
Nothing.

01:46:11.745 --> 01:46:13.235
Dig, dig, dig!

01:46:13.414 --> 01:46:15.712
You will find it for me.

01:46:16.684 --> 01:46:18.982
You will dig up
what you have come back for.

01:46:19.153 --> 01:46:20.177
No.

01:46:20.354 --> 01:46:22.788
Why should the diamond
go to the foreign devils?

01:46:23.524 --> 01:46:26.789
We will use it
to make the country strong.

01:46:27.261 --> 01:46:29.855
RUF is fighting for the people!

01:46:32.199 --> 01:46:35.293
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

01:46:38.138 --> 01:46:39.867
Pick it up.

01:46:41.075 --> 01:46:44.044
Why? You are going to kill me anyway.

01:46:44.211 --> 01:46:47.305
I do not need to kill you,
Solomon Vandy.

01:46:50.150 --> 01:46:52.345
If you do not bring me the diamond...

01:46:52.519 --> 01:46:54.749
...I will find the rest of your family.

01:46:54.922 --> 01:46:57.356
Just as I have found your son.

01:46:58.459 --> 01:47:01.826
I will rape your wife
in front of your eyes...

01:47:02.630 --> 01:47:04.928
...slit her throat...

01:47:05.532 --> 01:47:07.898
...and I will keep your daughters
for myself.

01:47:13.307 --> 01:47:15.741
You think I am a devil...

01:47:15.909 --> 01:47:18.241
...but only because I have lived in hell.

01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:22.542
I want to get out.

01:47:23.150 --> 01:47:25.243
You will help me.

01:47:28.088 --> 01:47:29.385
I don't remember.

01:47:29.556 --> 01:47:32.525
Find it or your family will die!

01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:35.325
Now pick it up!

01:47:50.878 --> 01:47:52.311
- Go!
- Bastards!

01:47:52.479 --> 01:47:53.844
Shoot it!

01:47:58.819 --> 01:47:59.808
Dia!

01:48:11.899 --> 01:48:14.094
Come, boy. Come. This way. This way.

01:48:14.968 --> 01:48:16.196
Dia!

01:48:39.093 --> 01:48:40.685
<i>Colonel, we think Archer's there.</i>

01:48:40.861 --> 01:48:43.694
I don't give a damn who's down there.
Kill them all.

01:48:54.041 --> 01:48:55.303
Dia!

01:49:10.057 --> 01:49:11.354
I'm coming!

01:49:14.895 --> 01:49:16.556
- Dia!
- Bastard!

01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:41.085
No!

01:50:01.175 --> 01:50:02.506
Dia!

01:51:08.742 --> 01:51:11.677
- We found his digger, sir.
- Keep him close.

01:51:13.647 --> 01:51:15.842
- Danny boy.
- Colonel.

01:51:16.016 --> 01:51:19.383
- Thanks for calling it in.
- Yeah, yeah. Always happy to help, huh?

01:51:19.553 --> 01:51:22.886
So where is it? The stone?

01:51:23.056 --> 01:51:24.990
We split, huh? Fifty-fifty, all right?

01:51:25.158 --> 01:51:26.785
Look around you, Danny boy.

01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:29.929
You're not in a position
to be dictating terms.

01:51:30.097 --> 01:51:32.190
Then you will never find it, sir.

01:51:32.366 --> 01:51:33.993
That's correct.

01:51:35.669 --> 01:51:38.297
- But he will.
- Come. Up.

01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:42.170
Introduce me to your digger.

01:51:43.744 --> 01:51:45.405
Solomon Vandy.

01:51:45.579 --> 01:51:47.740
This is Colonel Coetzee.
He wants the diamond.

01:51:47.915 --> 01:51:50.941
- No more than you.
- Fuck.

01:51:51.118 --> 01:51:53.109
You gonna show us where it's hidden?

01:51:55.789 --> 01:51:57.484
Does he speak English?

01:51:57.658 --> 01:52:00.684
He will only tell me, sir.
I promise you that.

01:52:01.528 --> 01:52:04.588
- Let me talk to him, huh?
- Go on.

01:52:11.338 --> 01:52:13.704
All right, my friend.

01:52:13.874 --> 01:52:15.808
End of the line here, huh?

01:52:15.976 --> 01:52:19.241
- You just tell him where it is, all right?
- I do not trust him.

01:52:19.413 --> 01:52:22.849
I don't trust him either,
but we haven't got much of a choice here.

01:52:24.551 --> 01:52:27.679
I promise you
he will shoot us both in the head.

01:52:28.121 --> 01:52:30.885
Right, tell him, huh?
Tell him where it is, huh?

01:52:31.058 --> 01:52:33.652
- Go on. Come on.
- I'm not feeling the love, Danny.

01:52:34.861 --> 01:52:37.694
All right.
No more messing about, all right?

01:52:37.864 --> 01:52:40.856
I said tell him where it is!
Tell him where it is! Now!

01:52:41.034 --> 01:52:42.695
Tell him!

01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:45.667
- No.
- Fucking...

01:52:45.839 --> 01:52:48.535
Danny, there are other ways
to do this, okay?

01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:50.336
Yeah, yeah.

01:52:58.518 --> 01:53:01.510
- If he tells us, do we have a deal, sir?
- Seventy-thirty.

01:53:01.688 --> 01:53:04.088
Sixty-forty. I've already lined up a buyer.

01:53:04.257 --> 01:53:05.918
Agreed.

01:53:11.098 --> 01:53:12.656
Come here.

01:53:15.235 --> 01:53:18.671
This is his son. Vandy will do
whatever you want for his sake, all right?

01:53:18.839 --> 01:53:23.606
Danny, you're a pisser, man. Well done.
Boys, we move out.

01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:28.678
What do you say, Mr. Vandy?

01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:32.050
- You ready to take a walk?
- Come on.

01:53:38.325 --> 01:53:39.917
Come on.

01:53:52.873 --> 01:53:55.967
So who's the buyer?
I'm guessing London.

01:53:56.176 --> 01:53:59.441
Well, they no longer accept
conflict diamonds, huh?

01:53:59.613 --> 01:54:02.081
Wouldn't hurt to interest
some other parties.

01:54:02.616 --> 01:54:05.608
- Start a bidding war.
- What, one war's not enough for you, huh?

01:54:06.553 --> 01:54:08.248
I missed you, Danny.

01:54:08.555 --> 01:54:12.719
See? It is here.
He has tried to find it.

01:54:12.893 --> 01:54:15.589
All right, Mr. Vandy.
Time for you to start digging.

01:54:30.644 --> 01:54:32.908
Hey, <i>boet</i>, have you got a smoke?

01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:35.280
Smoking will kill you.

01:54:36.049 --> 01:54:37.539
Sorry.

01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:42.520
It's all right.

01:54:42.689 --> 01:54:44.816
Time I quit smoking anyway,
huh, Solomon?

01:54:59.339 --> 01:55:00.670
- It's gone.
- What?

01:55:00.841 --> 01:55:02.934
Someone has taken it.

01:55:04.044 --> 01:55:07.810
This is where I buried it.
It isn't here.

01:55:08.281 --> 01:55:11.648
Well, then there's no reason
for any of you to stay alive. Is there?

01:55:15.989 --> 01:55:17.650
Wait, wait, wait.

01:55:17.824 --> 01:55:20.054
I know, I know. I know where it is.

01:55:20.527 --> 01:55:22.518
- I know where it is.
- It better be there.

01:55:27.701 --> 01:55:28.690
Yes.

01:55:28.869 --> 01:55:32.236
Oh, here, here.
It is here.

01:55:32.405 --> 01:55:34.066
- Yeah? Yeah, there it is.
- Yes.

01:55:35.242 --> 01:55:36.641
Fuck!

01:55:55.295 --> 01:55:57.229
TIA, huh, Danny?

01:55:58.632 --> 01:56:00.224
TIA.

01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:10.598
Keep digging, huh?
They'll be here any second. Come on.

01:56:12.812 --> 01:56:14.074
Keep digging.

01:56:26.927 --> 01:56:29.657
- It had better be there, huh?
- Yes, yes.

01:56:32.699 --> 01:56:34.291
Have you got it?

01:56:35.735 --> 01:56:39.000
- Have you got it, huh?
- Yes, got it. Oh, yes.

01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:41.702
Oh, yes.

01:56:43.877 --> 01:56:45.469
Solomon.

01:56:52.285 --> 01:56:55.254
Dia, what are you doing?

01:56:55.755 --> 01:56:57.245
Dia.

01:56:59.593 --> 01:57:01.493
What are you doing?

01:57:06.366 --> 01:57:07.663
Of the proud Mende tribe.

01:57:13.607 --> 01:57:18.476
You are a good boy
who loves soccer and school.

01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:23.908
Your mother loves you so much.

01:57:26.353 --> 01:57:29.151
She waits by the fire making plantains...

01:57:29.322 --> 01:57:31.984
...and red palm oil stew
with your sister N'Yanda...

01:57:34.261 --> 01:57:36.525
...and the new baby.

01:57:45.438 --> 01:57:47.702
The cows wait for you.

01:57:47.874 --> 01:57:53.676
And Babu, the wild dog
who minds no one but you.

01:57:56.249 --> 01:57:59.582
I know they made you do bad things...

01:57:59.753 --> 01:58:02.221
...but you are not a bad boy.

01:58:05.425 --> 01:58:07.825
I am your father...

01:58:09.529 --> 01:58:11.827
...who loves you.

01:58:13.099 --> 01:58:16.865
And you will come home with me
and be my son again.

01:58:42.295 --> 01:58:44.661
Solomon, we've got to move, huh?

01:58:44.831 --> 01:58:46.389
We've got to...

01:58:49.569 --> 01:58:52.265
Go, go! Move!

01:58:55.041 --> 01:58:56.599
Move. Move.

01:58:56.776 --> 01:58:58.073
Move, move, move!

01:58:58.244 --> 01:59:01.270
Move! Move! Move!

01:59:02.882 --> 01:59:04.110
How far?

01:59:04.284 --> 01:59:06.343
There's an airstrip
at the top of that gorge.

01:59:06.519 --> 01:59:08.612
A plane will meet us, huh?

01:59:09.022 --> 01:59:11.388
Hey, stop. Stop.

01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:17.653
Give it to me.
Come on, give it to me, huh?

01:59:25.171 --> 01:59:28.231
Keep moving. They'll be tracking us.

01:59:34.547 --> 01:59:36.606
Nabil, where are you?

01:59:37.684 --> 01:59:40.312
I'm nearly there.
Tell me what's happening.

01:59:40.487 --> 01:59:43.945
We're about 10 K's out, huh?
We've got it, my friend.

01:59:44.124 --> 01:59:46.024
<i>- Who is we?</i>
- The fisherman and his son.

01:59:46.192 --> 01:59:47.784
<i>Lose them.</i>

02:00:01.941 --> 02:00:04.034
It's at the top of that ridge there, huh?

02:00:04.210 --> 02:00:05.507
You must stop and rest.

02:00:05.678 --> 02:00:08.511
What? And give up the damn stone?

02:00:08.681 --> 02:00:10.740
Keep moving. Come on.

02:00:45.385 --> 02:00:47.717
Come. Come, come.

02:01:34.834 --> 02:01:37.132
I can't. Stop.

02:01:37.303 --> 02:01:39.362
- Okay.
- Stop.

02:02:07.834 --> 02:02:08.926
Come on.

02:02:09.536 --> 02:02:12.130
No! God, no. Stop.

02:02:13.239 --> 02:02:16.572
Christ. No more. No more.

02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:02.215
Take it, huh?

02:03:04.624 --> 02:03:07.821
- Mr. Archer...
- Take it, take it.

02:03:14.901 --> 02:03:16.664
I thought you would steal it from me.

02:03:18.504 --> 02:03:22.133
Yeah, yeah, it occurred to me, huh?

02:03:33.086 --> 02:03:34.713
Listen...

02:03:37.690 --> 02:03:40.090
...this is Maddy's card, huh?

02:03:40.259 --> 02:03:42.420
You call her when
you get to Conakry, all right?

02:03:46.666 --> 02:03:48.634
And don't trust that pilot for a second.

02:03:48.801 --> 02:03:51.861
You point this at his head
if he fucks around, all right?

02:03:52.038 --> 02:03:53.505
I can carry you.

02:04:06.419 --> 02:04:07.886
You take your boy home, huh?

02:04:13.059 --> 02:04:15.721
You take him home, huh?

02:04:20.266 --> 02:04:22.029
- Go! Go!
- Go. Come on.

02:04:22.869 --> 02:04:23.961
Go on!

02:04:29.709 --> 02:04:31.574
Come on. Come on.

02:04:38.384 --> 02:04:40.750
Archer, you're a dead man!

02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:42.751
Yeah, yeah.

02:05:13.453 --> 02:05:14.818
Dia.

02:05:36.042 --> 02:05:37.202
Hello. Maddy Bowen.

02:05:37.443 --> 02:05:39.274
Yeah.

02:05:39.612 --> 02:05:41.273
Thought I'd never call, huh?

02:05:42.181 --> 02:05:46.242
And I'm so glad you did.
Excuse me.

02:05:48.221 --> 02:05:49.381
When am I gonna see you?

02:05:50.523 --> 02:05:56.257
Maddy, I want you to do me
one more favor, huh?

02:05:56.963 --> 02:06:01.491
I want you to go meet Solomon
in Conakry.

02:06:01.701 --> 02:06:04.397
In Guinea?
Why do you want me to go to Guinea?

02:06:07.406 --> 02:06:09.465
We found his son...

02:06:10.443 --> 02:06:13.844
...but he's gonna need some help,
you understand?

02:06:14.614 --> 02:06:15.706
<i>Maddy?</i>

02:06:18.518 --> 02:06:20.383
You're hurt.

02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:22.078
Are you hurt?

02:06:22.255 --> 02:06:25.418
Yeah, well, I've got
a little problem here.

02:06:29.996 --> 02:06:33.693
Okay. You...
You tell me where you are.

02:06:36.969 --> 02:06:37.993
<i>Archer?</i>

02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:54.882
I'm looking at an incredible view
right now.

02:06:56.289 --> 02:06:57.916
I wish you were here, Maddy.

02:06:58.090 --> 02:07:01.753
Okay, then I'm coming to be with you.
You just tell me where you are.

02:07:04.964 --> 02:07:06.295
I don't think so.

02:07:06.465 --> 02:07:09.798
Are you still in Kono? Because I can
get someone there to help you.

02:07:09.969 --> 02:07:14.235
Maddy, you find someplace safe
for the boy, all right?

02:07:14.407 --> 02:07:16.807
<i>And keep him out of sight.</i>

02:07:17.410 --> 02:07:20.140
<i>And get Solomon to London.</i>

02:07:23.282 --> 02:07:26.046
He's bringing something with him.

02:07:26.719 --> 02:07:28.653
But he's gonna need your help.

02:07:29.889 --> 02:07:31.720
Why aren't you bringing it yourself?

02:07:33.226 --> 02:07:38.289
I'm saying it's a real story now.

02:07:39.198 --> 02:07:40.927
And you can write the hell out of it.

02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:50.665
I'm really happy I met you.

02:07:52.245 --> 02:07:53.234
You know that?

02:07:56.582 --> 02:07:58.709
Yeah, I'm...

02:07:59.919 --> 02:08:02.979
I'm really happy I met you too.

02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:07.582
<i>And I wish I could be there with you.</i>

02:08:08.461 --> 02:08:10.429
That's all right.

02:08:12.965 --> 02:08:15.365
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

02:09:08.988 --> 02:09:11.320
When we get to the stairs,
you just keep walking...

02:09:11.490 --> 02:09:13.515
...and I'll wait for you here.

02:09:14.093 --> 02:09:15.617
You're not coming.

02:09:15.795 --> 02:09:19.060
I'm not here. Good luck.

02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:43.382
You must understand, Mr. Vandy...

02:09:43.556 --> 02:09:49.620
...that your diamond could have ended up
nowhere else but with us.

02:09:52.932 --> 02:09:55.901
- It is not enough.
- I assure you, 2 million pounds...

02:09:56.068 --> 02:09:59.936
...is more than anyone else will offer you
for that stone under the circumstances.

02:10:00.106 --> 02:10:02.802
I want what was promised to me
by Mr. Archer.

02:10:06.278 --> 02:10:08.803
- What was promised to you?
- My family.

02:10:09.148 --> 02:10:11.139
When they are here,
you will get the stone.

02:10:11.817 --> 02:10:13.444
I will have the money too.

02:10:14.754 --> 02:10:16.278
Well, may I see what I'm buying?

02:10:16.455 --> 02:10:19.219
You will get the stone
once my family is here.

02:10:19.992 --> 02:10:21.789
How do I even know you've got it?

02:12:29.688 --> 02:12:32.452
Can you comment on the diamonds
mined in Sierra Leone?

02:12:32.625 --> 02:12:36.527
I'm not going to comment
on some sensationalist magazine article.

02:12:36.695 --> 02:12:39.289
- What about Liberia?
- No comment. No comment.

02:12:39.465 --> 02:12:41.865
- Mr. Van De Kaap...
- That's all I have to say.

02:12:42.034 --> 02:12:43.433
The natural resources
of a country...

02:12:45.437 --> 02:12:48.406
...are the property of its people.
They are not ours to steal...

02:12:49.742 --> 02:12:55.203
<i>... or exploit in the name of our comfort,</i>
<i>our corporations, or our consumerism.</i>

02:13:05.124 --> 02:13:07.183
They're ready for you, sir.

02:13:08.694 --> 02:13:11.094
The Third World is not a world apart.

02:13:11.263 --> 02:13:15.927
And the witness you will hear today
speaks on its behalf.

02:13:16.101 --> 02:13:19.969
Let us hear the voice of that world.
Let us learn from that voice.

02:13:20.139 --> 02:13:23.666
And let us ignore it no more.

02:13:23.842 --> 02:13:27.175
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Solomon Vandy.
