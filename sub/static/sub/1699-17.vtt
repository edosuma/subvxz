WEBVTT

00:08.556 --> 00:10.087
Hey, this is new.

00:10.437 --> 00:11.891
A dollar for water?

00:11.892 --> 00:13.860
That is ridiculous.
Eddie, give me a dollar.

00:15.291 --> 00:16.525
What, you broke again?

00:16.526 --> 00:18.755
No, I just don't have change
for a million.

00:20.079 --> 00:20.967
Rae

00:20.968 --> 00:22.542
the fountain's
for free.

00:24.746 --> 00:26.408
Okay, no wonder
there's never a line.

00:27.654 --> 00:29.354
Where's that
music coming from?

00:32.526 --> 00:34.149
Raven, these are for you.

00:36.365 --> 00:39.371
Hey, I know that face--
you just had a vision.

00:39.372 --> 00:40.319
Chels

00:40.320 --> 00:45.126
a really cute guy came to my
house, and he gave me flowers.

00:45.127 --> 00:46.846
Who was he? And does he have a friend?

00:47.951 --> 00:49.954
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

00:58.426 --> 01:00.788
Till this second.
Hey, cutie.

01:04.396 --> 01:07.072
Oh, yo, that's the new kid,
Jonathan Quizowski.

01:07.073 --> 01:08.397
They call him "Quiz."

01:12.968 --> 01:15.194
Anyways,
he's totally into jazz.

01:15.195 --> 01:16.994
Oh, and I am totally into him.

01:16.995 --> 01:19.045
Now, I just got
to meet him first.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.560
How do you think it's going to happen?

01:20.561 --> 01:22.096
You know, that's the problem
with these visions, Chels--

01:22.097 --> 01:24.289
they show what you get
but not how you get there.

01:24.290 --> 01:25.082
Yeah.

01:25.896 --> 01:27.076
Oh, my gosh.

01:27.077 --> 01:29.156
The San Francisco Jazz
Festival's next week.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.818
You should buy tickets
and ask him out.

01:30.819 --> 01:31.750
Great plan

01:31.751 --> 01:32.992
except she can't afford water.

01:33.869 --> 01:35.790
You see, see that's what friends
are for.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.642
See, we just all dig down deep

01:37.643 --> 01:38.593
and...

01:42.026 --> 01:42.814
Guys?

01:43.543 --> 01:45.115
I should have seen that coming.

02:34.442 --> 02:35.703
Yep, that's me.

02:47.696 --> 02:49.725
Hmm, where to start?

02:49.726 --> 02:52.054
Uh, with a box of cereal.

02:52.055 --> 02:54.283
'Cause all this?
Not for you.

02:55.688 --> 02:57.241
Well, who's it for?

02:57.242 --> 02:59.473
Mom and Dad-- they get
a gourmet breakfast

02:59.474 --> 03:00.538
and all they
have to do

03:00.539 --> 03:01.832
is sit through a
short presentation

03:01.833 --> 03:03.229
about raising
my allowance.

03:03.230 --> 03:04.430
Everyone wins.

03:05.028 --> 03:06.889
You could just come to me
for money.

03:06.890 --> 03:07.856
I'm loaded.

03:09.726 --> 03:11.625
Yeah, but you always
turn me down.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.248
And it never gets old!

03:15.890 --> 03:18.640
Mmm, smells like fresh
blueberry muffins

03:18.641 --> 03:20.051
and hickory-smoked bacon.

03:20.052 --> 03:23.560
Mmm, smells to me like we're
getting hit up for cash.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.126
Just hear me out.

03:26.426 --> 03:29.925
Okay. Turn your attention
to page eight.

03:29.926 --> 03:33.788
Now, as you know, I do my own
clothing, I do my own nails

03:33.789 --> 03:35.437
but I still need money
for the essentials:

03:35.438 --> 03:37.854
we're talking hair, shoes,
jazz festival tickets.

03:38.949 --> 03:40.375
Since when are you into jazz?

03:40.376 --> 03:42.054
Like forever, Daddy-O

03:42.055 --> 03:44.485
and all I need is the green
to make the scene.

03:44.944 --> 03:48.292
Well, I hear what you're saying,
but I'm not paying.

03:50.126 --> 03:52.256
Honey, why don't you just save
your money like your brother?

03:54.996 --> 03:56.751
'Cause he's cheap,
and I got a life.

03:56.752 --> 03:58.338
Which I can buy
and sell.

04:00.496 --> 04:02.434
Baby, how are you
ever going to learn

04:02.435 --> 04:05.087
the value of money if we just
keep giving it to you?

04:06.039 --> 04:07.199
By shopping?

04:09.048 --> 04:11.225
No, by earning it.

04:11.226 --> 04:13.232
Do some extra chores.
Get a part-time job.

04:14.281 --> 04:15.722
I could use a foot massage.

04:16.326 --> 04:18.714
You better keep your little
piggies away from my bacon.

04:22.023 --> 04:23.914
Here's one, Rae:
"Lifeguards wanted."

04:23.915 --> 04:25.244
It's perfect for you.

04:25.245 --> 04:27.801
Hello, I cannot swim.

04:27.802 --> 04:30.729
Well, if you're going to
shoot down everything...

04:32.510 --> 04:34.082
Just keep looking, okay?

04:34.083 --> 04:35.591
Th-There's got to be
something out there

04:35.592 --> 04:37.526
'cause I am not letting
this vision get away.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.498
Yo, check this one out.
It's perfect.

04:39.499 --> 04:41.196
"Psychics wanted.
Earn big bucks."

04:41.197 --> 04:42.359
Are you serious?

04:42.360 --> 04:43.334
Right there.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.151
I- I don't know.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.243
Besides you guys
and my family

04:46.244 --> 04:47.622
no one else knows
I'm psychic.

04:47.623 --> 04:49.641
Yeah, Rae, and it's kind
of wrong to use your powers

04:49.642 --> 04:51.617
you know, to make money. Aw, come on

04:51.618 --> 04:52.885
that's what gifts are for.

04:52.886 --> 04:56.239
You don't see Shaq just
shooting hoop in his driveway...

04:56.240 --> 04:59.476
and Michael Jackson just don't
moonwalk around his pool.

04:59.776 --> 05:03.153
And J-Lo sure don't hide
"it" in baggy pants.

05:03.154 --> 05:05.118
There it is. Oh, Lord.

05:08.181 --> 05:10.254
I'm just saying, if you got it,
you should use it.

05:15.917 --> 05:20.125
The cards tell me
that you are very lonely.

05:20.126 --> 05:22.310
Yes, my man'll be
gone for five to ten years.

05:23.761 --> 05:27.244
Mm, he's in jail,
isn't he, child?

05:27.245 --> 05:28.782
How did you know that?

05:28.783 --> 05:32.905
If Madam Cassandra can't see it,
it's not happenin'.

05:32.906 --> 05:34.386
Call me now!

05:37.126 --> 05:39.048
She is amazing.

05:39.049 --> 05:40.775
She's the best in the business.

05:40.776 --> 05:43.027
So, uh, you ready to be
in the business?

05:43.028 --> 05:44.609
Really? I'm hired?

05:44.610 --> 05:46.115
Oh, thank you so much,
Mr. Banks.

05:46.116 --> 05:46.925
I mean

05:46.926 --> 05:48.634
don't you want to ask me
some questions?

05:48.635 --> 05:50.537
Uh, are you a cop?

05:53.914 --> 05:55.046
Then no further questions.

05:55.047 --> 05:56.327
Let's give it a whirl.

05:57.454 --> 06:00.245
This is...
where the magic happens.

06:00.246 --> 06:02.717
Um, yeah, listen, Mr. Banks

06:02.718 --> 06:05.416
you know, I've never really gone
public about me being psychic

06:05.417 --> 06:07.151
and everything, and plus,
I don't even know

06:07.152 --> 06:08.174
when I'm going to
have my visions.

06:08.175 --> 06:09.152
Like, the last one
I had was about

06:09.153 --> 06:11.796
this cute guy named Quiz: he came
to my place with these flowers

06:11.797 --> 06:13.612
but he doesn't really know
I exist when I'm at school

06:13.613 --> 06:15.802
so I'm thinking of buying him
these jazz concert tickets...

06:15.803 --> 06:18.310
but you don't care, do you? No.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.774
Hey, you are psychic.

06:21.694 --> 06:23.323
Now, uh, listen.

06:23.324 --> 06:25.821
The name of the game is to keep
people on the line, right?

06:25.822 --> 06:27.958
Okay. The more they
talk, the more we make.

06:27.959 --> 06:30.642
So, if you think somebody's
about to hang up

06:31.041 --> 06:32.302
what do you do?

06:32.303 --> 06:33.645
"Thanks for calling."

06:33.646 --> 06:35.744
No, no, no, no.

06:35.745 --> 06:37.391
You say "Wait, wait, wait.

06:37.392 --> 06:39.016
I... I think I'm getting
something."

06:41.078 --> 06:42.071
I don't know.

06:42.072 --> 06:44.777
I mean, something
doesn't feel right.

06:45.096 --> 06:47.660
Well, if you...
don't want 15 bucks an hour...

06:47.661 --> 06:48.796
15 an hour? Wait.

06:50.036 --> 06:51.594
Yes, I think
I'm getting something.

07:05.833 --> 07:06.835
Hi, my name is...

07:10.145 --> 07:11.669
Yeah, how long...?

07:14.596 --> 07:16.779
Ooh, you know, I got these
tickets to...

07:23.556 --> 07:26.322
How am I ever going to ask him
to the jazz festival

07:26.323 --> 07:28.068
if he never stops playing?

07:28.069 --> 07:30.215
Well, if you're talking
about concert tickets

07:30.216 --> 07:31.630
I'm guessing you
got the job.

07:31.631 --> 07:32.510
Yeah, I got it.

07:32.511 --> 07:34.376
Oh, my gosh, Rae,
congratulations.

07:34.377 --> 07:36.044
Now you can use
your psychic powers

07:36.045 --> 07:37.503
to make the world
a better place.

07:39.783 --> 07:41.857
Rae, you're kind of
bringing down the hug.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.325
Chels, listen.

07:44.326 --> 07:47.030
The job is not exactly
what you think it is.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.730
Yeah, but how's
the money?

07:48.731 --> 07:49.955
It's great, but...

07:49.956 --> 07:51.323
you don't even have
to be psychic.

07:51.324 --> 07:52.872
They will hire anyone.

07:56.296 --> 08:01.478
Yes, yes, I am getting
something, wait... it's a name.

08:02.167 --> 08:05.857
Yes, and it starts with an "A."

08:07.469 --> 08:08.809
Okay, a "B"?

08:10.236 --> 08:12.192
You know, maybe it was a "C"?

08:12.909 --> 08:15.703
D... E... F... G, H, I, J...

08:15.704 --> 08:18.003
J! J, J, J, yes, yes.

08:18.004 --> 08:20.883
Yes, I was actually going
to say that first

08:20.884 --> 08:22.693
but I didn't want
to freak you out.

08:23.678 --> 08:25.402
Wait, wait,
I'm getting something.

08:25.403 --> 08:27.060
Yes, uh-huh, mm-hmm.

08:27.061 --> 08:29.116
I see love in your future,
definitely.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.995
A nice younger man.

08:32.674 --> 08:34.128
You're 94?

08:36.025 --> 08:39.049
Well, everyone's younger
than you, so, uh, I'm right.

08:41.796 --> 08:43.025
Yeah, uh-huh...

08:43.025 --> 08:44.610
Now, wait a second. Wait.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.639
All right, well, h-hold on.
I'm getting something.

08:51.755 --> 08:55.276
Jim... Jason... James.

08:56.424 --> 08:57.520
"Jinxy"?

08:58.949 --> 09:01.265
That kind of sounds like
a cat's name or something.

09:02.591 --> 09:06.068
Oh, it is a cat? Oh, yes, yes.

09:06.069 --> 09:07.660
Ooh, Mr. Hank.

09:07.661 --> 09:10.746
Madame Cassandra see
an ill wind a-blowin'

09:10.747 --> 09:13.392
and the spirits
are a-cryin'!

09:13.393 --> 09:15.538
Get to the point... Shirley.

09:15.539 --> 09:16.801
I need a raise.

09:17.926 --> 09:19.861
Oh. Oh, uh, forget it.

09:20.397 --> 09:21.925
Grab your bag of bones

09:21.926 --> 09:23.286
tighten
your little turban...

09:23.287 --> 09:24.813
'cause you're on
in five minutes.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.654
Either I get my raise,
you sleazebag

09:27.655 --> 09:28.916
or I'm out of here.

09:28.917 --> 09:31.336
And this show
would be nothing...

09:32.158 --> 09:33.662
without Madame Cassandra.

09:35.478 --> 09:36.711
Are you kidding?

09:36.712 --> 09:39.095
Any one of these clowns
could replace you.

09:39.833 --> 09:41.523
Hey, hey. Hey you.

09:41.524 --> 09:42.398
What?

09:44.215 --> 09:47.995
Hello, little Jinx, hello.
Who's a little kitty?

09:47.996 --> 09:49.281
You. Yes, you.

09:49.282 --> 09:52.167
You're my new star.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.943
Yes, from now on,
the world will know you as...

10:02.859 --> 10:06.952
Miss Tallulah on the line,
ready to tell your future.

10:08.721 --> 10:11.503
Next caller, who be you?

10:12.096 --> 10:13.713
My, uh, friends call me "Quiz."

10:13.714 --> 10:14.779
"Quiz"?

10:17.591 --> 10:19.046
Well, I'm trying to get
a scholarship

10:19.047 --> 10:20.350
to jazz camp this summer.

10:21.477 --> 10:23.778
Ooh. You play the sax.

10:24.096 --> 10:26.475
That's amazing! How'd you know?

10:26.476 --> 10:30.101
Oh, well, child, it's all
right here in me crystal ball.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.854
Ooh, and so is
the Lincoln Memorial.

10:34.408 --> 10:36.813
Oh, wait, so-so, do you think
I'll get the scholarship?

10:36.814 --> 10:38.516
Ooh, let's see, child.

10:39.091 --> 10:40.297
What's your sign?

10:40.298 --> 10:40.893
Aries.

10:40.894 --> 10:42.530
Ah, the Fish.

10:42.531 --> 10:44.021
Uh, uh, the Ram.

10:46.282 --> 10:48.528
I knew that.
I's just ordering lunch.

10:48.529 --> 10:50.097
I'll take the fish.

10:53.864 --> 10:55.833
I got the scholarship!

10:58.896 --> 11:00.492
Miss, Miss Tallulah,
are you there?

11:02.302 --> 11:05.355
Yes, child,
and with good news, too.

11:05.356 --> 11:08.683
Pack your sax, Quiz.
You're going to jazz camp.

11:09.424 --> 11:12.076
Wow! Thanks. Is there
anything else?

11:12.077 --> 11:13.577
Oh, yeah, I hope so. Oh...

11:14.852 --> 11:15.965
I mean...

11:19.609 --> 11:21.336
I tink I'm getting something.

11:22.726 --> 11:25.497
Yes, aw, yes, child.

11:25.498 --> 11:28.584
The mystic bones
are rattling, yes.

11:28.585 --> 11:31.360
They say that you
must meet a girl.

11:31.361 --> 11:32.691
Uh, who is she?

11:33.144 --> 11:35.283
Oh, child,
she's at your school.

11:35.284 --> 11:39.127
I see she's very,
very beautiful, really.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.791
Yeah, with a name
like a bird.

11:42.251 --> 11:43.223
Uh, Robin.

11:43.224 --> 11:44.443
Uh, no.

11:44.444 --> 11:45.033
Lark?

11:45.034 --> 11:45.970
No.

11:45.971 --> 11:47.619
Uh, Nancy Hawksten.

11:47.931 --> 11:49.125
Forget it.

11:49.126 --> 11:52.456
Her name is Raven.
You got to go meet her.

11:52.457 --> 11:54.925
She lives at 519 Miranda Place.

11:54.926 --> 11:57.657
Ring her doorbell Friday night
around...

11:57.658 --> 11:59.446
yes, the mystic clock says 8:00!

12:00.267 --> 12:01.840
Okay, yeah, yeah,
I don't get it.

12:01.841 --> 12:02.936
Why do I have to go
to her place...?

12:02.937 --> 12:05.247
No backin'- talkin',
child!

12:05.999 --> 12:08.243
Okay? This is what
the mystics say.

12:08.244 --> 12:10.640
It's the only way
to get your scholarship.

12:10.641 --> 12:12.400
She's your
good luck charm.

12:14.742 --> 12:17.325
All right?
Thanks for calling, Quiz.

12:17.326 --> 12:18.304
Call me now.

12:18.305 --> 12:23.228
Call me Sidekicks, because
your future's on the line.

12:25.778 --> 12:28.095
Wow, that-that
was great, kid.

12:28.096 --> 12:30.095
The phones are ringing
off the hook.

12:30.096 --> 12:32.473
Oh, and that weird look that
you get in your eyes, that...

12:34.856 --> 12:36.878
Keep it. It's gold.

12:40.914 --> 12:42.452
So, what do you think
of Miss Tallulah?

12:42.453 --> 12:44.202
Uh, I think she's
using her powers

12:44.203 --> 12:46.062
to manipulate a guy
into liking her.

12:46.063 --> 12:46.591
Chels

12:46.592 --> 12:48.285
okay, I just want
to meet him.

12:48.286 --> 12:49.210
And then what?

12:49.211 --> 12:51.070
Well, you know,
once we're alone together

12:51.071 --> 12:52.732
he'll realize that
we were meant for each other.

12:52.733 --> 12:54.202
I'm just trying to do
what you were saying:

12:54.203 --> 12:55.997
making the world
a better place.

12:55.998 --> 12:57.032
You know, just...

12:57.033 --> 12:59.487
one guy at a time, child.

13:07.747 --> 13:10.660
So, the kids are out.

13:10.661 --> 13:13.238
We have the house
to ourselves.

13:13.572 --> 13:15.302
You know what
that means?

13:15.303 --> 13:16.695
Oh, yeah.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.161
Pizza.

13:20.380 --> 13:22.127
That'll be $22.50.

13:22.128 --> 13:22.792
Cool.

13:22.793 --> 13:25.185
Oh, honey, I didn't get
a chance to go to the ATM.

13:25.186 --> 13:26.055
Do you have any money on you?

13:26.056 --> 13:27.527
I picked up the cleaning.
I'm broke.

13:28.153 --> 13:29.277
Do you take credit cards?

13:29.278 --> 13:31.158
Gee, let me check my shirt.

13:34.300 --> 13:36.695
There's got to be some cash
around here someplace.

13:38.947 --> 13:40.346
It's got to be here someplace.

13:40.347 --> 13:41.793
Yeah, Corey's loaded.

13:41.794 --> 13:43.223
You know he hasn't spent
a dime

13:43.224 --> 13:44.795
of his birthday
or Christmas money

13:44.796 --> 13:46.121
since he's been born.

13:48.445 --> 13:50.595
Uh-oh. I found a magazine.

13:51.756 --> 13:53.373
I blame you, Victor.

13:54.517 --> 13:55.680
Retire at 12?

13:55.681 --> 13:57.348
Gotcha.

14:01.126 --> 14:02.526
Jackpot! Jackpot!

14:03.649 --> 14:04.275
What do you think

14:04.276 --> 14:05.225
the combination is?

14:05.226 --> 14:06.201
Try his birthday.

14:06.202 --> 14:07.193
Ooh, good one.

14:08.796 --> 14:10.006
He's not so smart.

14:12.013 --> 14:14.463
Security alert!

14:14.464 --> 14:16.121
Security alert!

14:16.122 --> 14:17.741
Security alert!

14:18.471 --> 14:21.347
Bring security
in my room-room-room-room!

14:21.348 --> 14:23.409
Attention, security!

14:26.212 --> 14:30.994
Bring security
in my room-room-room!

14:30.995 --> 14:32.813
VICTOR:
Why that little...!

14:32.814 --> 14:34.087
Got you, Raven!

14:37.181 --> 14:39.155
Mom? Dad?

14:40.668 --> 14:43.339
I am so disappointed.

14:54.356 --> 14:56.514
Yeah, uh, Raven, like, the bird?

14:56.515 --> 14:57.514
Yes.

14:57.515 --> 14:59.073
And, um, who are you?

14:59.074 --> 15:01.690
Oh, it's, uh, Quiz
from school.

15:01.691 --> 15:02.925
Quiz!

15:02.926 --> 15:04.955
What are you doing here?

15:04.956 --> 15:07.026
Okay, I know this is going
to sound kind of weird

15:07.027 --> 15:10.072
but, uh, Raven, you are
my good luck charm.

15:10.866 --> 15:15.258
Oh, that is the sweetest thing
to say.

15:15.259 --> 15:17.614
You know what, I really
wasn't expecting company

15:17.615 --> 15:19.382
but... what the heck.

15:19.383 --> 15:20.425
Come on in.

15:20.426 --> 15:23.494
Uh, Raven, these are for you.

15:23.495 --> 15:24.602
Oh, thank you.

15:31.006 --> 15:32.496
That's a nice dress
you got there.

15:32.497 --> 15:34.219
Oh, this old thing?

15:34.220 --> 15:36.091
Darlin', I made it this morning.

15:36.655 --> 15:37.856
Really?

15:37.857 --> 15:40.120
Wow, Lisa,
check this out.

15:40.121 --> 15:41.002
Lisa?

15:41.723 --> 15:43.230
Yeah, Lisa, Raven
made this dress

15:43.231 --> 15:44.318
all by herself.

15:44.319 --> 15:47.687
Yes, girl, and we are
so excited about it.

15:47.688 --> 15:48.911
But who are you?

15:49.495 --> 15:52.165
Oh, yeah, sorry,
this is, uh, my girlfriend.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.191
Lisa.

15:55.059 --> 15:57.203
I had to meet Quiz's
good luck charm.

15:58.231 --> 15:59.630
You have a girlfriend?

15:59.631 --> 16:00.755
Yeah, yeah, I do.

16:00.756 --> 16:02.975
Okay, so,
I came to your house

16:02.976 --> 16:04.770
I met you,
I gave you the flowers.

16:04.771 --> 16:06.381
It was Lisa's idea.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.482
Lisa!

16:08.761 --> 16:10.561
Well, it was
nice meeting you.

16:11.396 --> 16:12.125
Yeah.

16:12.126 --> 16:13.636
Guess it was.

16:13.956 --> 16:15.701
It's funny how
things work out.

16:16.661 --> 16:18.021
Or don't.

16:19.891 --> 16:22.124
Here. You guys
might like these.

16:23.126 --> 16:25.355
Tickets to the
jazz festival!

16:25.356 --> 16:27.539
You know, you really
are my good luck charm.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.140
Oh, man, Rae.

16:47.141 --> 16:48.089
He had a girlfriend?

16:48.090 --> 16:49.191
Lisa!

16:49.192 --> 16:50.484
You were right, Chels.

16:50.485 --> 16:52.323
I shouldn't have used my gift
to get a guy.

16:52.324 --> 16:53.331
Yeah.

16:53.332 --> 16:54.905
And I shouldn't have
filled up on doughnuts

16:54.906 --> 16:56.756
when they're bringing
in a whole deli platter.

16:58.316 --> 16:59.705
Anyway, Rae,
I don't know.

16:59.706 --> 17:00.890
Maybe you should look
at the bright side.

17:00.891 --> 17:02.184
You know, at least
no one got hurt.

17:02.185 --> 17:03.046
But me.

17:03.047 --> 17:04.737
There you go-- bright side.

17:07.126 --> 17:08.194
Hey, you two, hey.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.955
Back on the phones, let's go.

17:10.996 --> 17:13.579
Okay, you. You're on.

17:18.243 --> 17:20.601
Hi, Doris.
Hi, yeah, it's Chelsea

17:20.602 --> 17:22.358
your psychic sidekick.

17:22.359 --> 17:23.768
How's little Jinxy doing?

17:24.454 --> 17:27.711
Oh, still hacking out
that hair ball, yuk.

17:28.017 --> 17:29.295
Hold it.

17:29.296 --> 17:30.830
Uh, first of all

17:30.831 --> 17:31.886
we don't make money

17:31.887 --> 17:34.041
when the psychics call
the customers. Uh...

17:34.451 --> 17:37.252
And, uh, yeah, second of all,
you're fired, okay?

17:37.253 --> 17:40.118
And, oh, why don't you
take Jaws with you?

17:43.026 --> 17:45.195
Okay, caller, who be you?

17:45.196 --> 17:47.296
Uh, yeah, this is Quiz again.

17:47.727 --> 17:49.320
What's wrong, Quiz?

17:49.321 --> 17:51.392
Okay, yeah, yeah,
I didn't get into Jazz Camp.

17:51.393 --> 17:53.190
I was supposed to hear by now.

17:53.191 --> 17:54.715
The mail is slow, child.

17:54.716 --> 17:56.492
No reason to get
your horn out of tune.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.886
No, no, I-I must've messed
things up with Raven.

17:58.887 --> 18:02.652
Maybe I shouldn't have
brought my girlfriend, or...

18:02.653 --> 18:05.626
Ooh, well, I can't argue
with you there, child.

18:07.066 --> 18:08.415
Okay, wait, wait.
What are you saying?

18:08.416 --> 18:10.203
Should I break up
with her, or...?

18:10.204 --> 18:13.882
Uh, uh, no.
No, Quiz, no.

18:13.883 --> 18:15.380
That be bad, all right.

18:15.381 --> 18:16.563
We don't want nobody
to get hurt

18:16.564 --> 18:18.295
because of what
Miss Tallulah say.

18:18.296 --> 18:20.686
Miss Tallulah, okay,
I am freaking out.

18:20.687 --> 18:22.926
How come I didn't
get that scholarship?

18:23.601 --> 18:25.406
You know, wait,
am I-I jinxed?

18:25.407 --> 18:26.558
Did I lose my talent?

18:26.559 --> 18:27.603
Should I quite music?

18:27.604 --> 18:29.416
Oh, slow your row, child!

18:30.750 --> 18:32.674
Take the island breath.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.164
There's no one plays the horn
like you

18:35.165 --> 18:37.955
and you don't need to call
Miss Tallulah to tell you that.

18:39.456 --> 18:40.812
Yes, he does.

18:41.356 --> 18:43.580
So, any clown can do this,
huh, Hank?

18:43.581 --> 18:44.310
Quiz!

18:44.311 --> 18:46.879
Listen to Miss Tallulah, okay?

18:46.880 --> 18:49.451
You're just wasting your money
calling me.

18:49.452 --> 18:50.619
No, he, no, he isn't.

18:50.620 --> 18:52.009
What-what is she saying?

18:52.010 --> 18:53.874
So, how about
that raise?

18:53.875 --> 18:55.598
Yeah, fine, fine,
okay, anything.

18:55.599 --> 18:56.821
Just get out there,
okay?

18:56.822 --> 18:58.179
And you keep that kid
on the line.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.688
Please, Miss Tallulah,
check the mystic bones.

19:00.689 --> 19:01.479
What do they say?

19:01.480 --> 19:02.540
Quiz, Quiz, Quiz.

19:02.541 --> 19:03.365
Listen.

19:03.956 --> 19:05.915
This is not mystic bones.

19:05.916 --> 19:07.895
Child, this was my lunch!

19:09.713 --> 19:12.412
Okay, yes it was a secret recipe
and very good

19:12.413 --> 19:15.158
but nothing's mystical
about it!

19:15.159 --> 19:17.325
Are you saying that you're not
a real psychic?

19:18.217 --> 19:21.133
Ooh... now, that's a very
complicated question.

19:21.134 --> 19:24.228
Oh, the spirits are very angry!

19:24.229 --> 19:25.930
Madame Cassandra?

19:25.931 --> 19:27.320
They're saying

19:27.321 --> 19:28.622
she lies, Quiz.

19:28.623 --> 19:31.730
Like a Jamaican dog
full of sand fleas.

19:31.731 --> 19:33.038
Now, get out!

19:33.039 --> 19:34.170
Quiz, stay on the line.

19:34.171 --> 19:36.595
Ah! No! Listen to me, Quiz.

19:36.596 --> 19:39.316
No real psychic would be
on a cheesy show like this!

19:40.556 --> 19:42.043
Ooh, you hear that?

19:42.044 --> 19:43.918
She's a bad coconut.

19:43.919 --> 19:47.546
Excuse me while I shake
the evil out of her.

19:53.074 --> 19:54.286
Missed me.

19:54.287 --> 19:55.561
Gotcha.

19:57.926 --> 19:59.295
Oh, getting dizzy.

19:59.296 --> 20:00.364
Oh, no, that's enough.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.721
Oh, here comes lunch.

20:01.722 --> 20:04.818
Say toodle-oo, Tallulah.

20:07.763 --> 20:09.391
Bring it on, Shirley.

20:11.232 --> 20:14.927
Oh, snap, no, you didn't
just break my hand.

20:14.928 --> 20:16.698
What are you going
to do about it?

20:21.252 --> 20:22.692
Guess she could do that.

20:26.941 --> 20:30.074
Man, Rae sure swings a pretty
mean finger, doesn't she?

20:33.973 --> 20:35.294
Hang up, Quiz!

20:35.295 --> 20:36.396
Don't hang up!

20:36.397 --> 20:37.326
Wait, wait, wait.

20:37.327 --> 20:38.585
Everybody, wait!

20:38.586 --> 20:39.938
I think I'm getting
something.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.774
Oh, yeah, this.
Come on!

20:43.565 --> 20:44.980
Okay, you know what?
Hold up.

20:44.981 --> 20:46.932
I don't need this,
huh-uh.

20:46.933 --> 20:48.471
I made more money
waitressing.

20:50.805 --> 20:52.692
Okay, am I getting charged
for this

20:52.693 --> 20:54.183
'cause, you know,
nobody's helping me.

20:54.184 --> 20:56.175
Quiz, don't you see?

20:56.176 --> 20:57.736
It is all a fake! Look!

20:57.737 --> 20:59.531
Hello! It's me, Raven!

20:59.532 --> 21:01.711
Yeah, yeah, wait,
wait, the mail just came.

21:03.907 --> 21:06.260
I got the scholarship.

21:06.261 --> 21:07.731
Wow, I better call Lisa.

21:09.845 --> 21:11.141
Do you see that?

21:11.142 --> 21:12.473
He still didn't
notice me.

21:12.474 --> 21:14.456
Just like a man.

21:16.301 --> 21:17.320
You right.

21:17.650 --> 21:20.098
Hank, I think
you're out of business.

21:20.591 --> 21:21.995
Are you kidding?

21:21.996 --> 21:23.426
You gave me a great idea.

21:23.427 --> 21:25.258
Female psychic gladiators.

21:25.259 --> 21:26.848
It's going to be huge.

21:26.849 --> 21:28.987
Ooh, really?
Does it pay a lot?

21:28.988 --> 21:30.732
'Cause I'm going to
need a summer job.

21:42.657 --> 21:43.907
Yo, Rae.
You got a buck?

21:43.908 --> 21:44.860
I'm busted.

21:44.861 --> 21:47.588
Again? I was counting on you
treating for the movies tonight.

21:47.589 --> 21:49.472
Well, I was counting on you.

21:49.473 --> 21:51.451
I guess everybody's broke then.

21:51.452 --> 21:52.747
See ya.

21:56.196 --> 21:58.130
Not everybody.

21:58.131 --> 22:00.366
Gotcha! Gotcha!

22:01.193 --> 22:02.899
Corey!

22:02.900 --> 22:05.036
Get...! Get me out of here!

22:05.037 --> 22:06.160
Corey!
