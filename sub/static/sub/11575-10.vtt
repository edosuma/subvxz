| feel different.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.756
| feel good.

00:16.225 --> 00:19.638
Oh, this is
gonna be fun...

00:19.896 --> 00:20.726
KENZI: Bo, get up!

00:20.980 --> 00:22.015
Bo, you're up!
Okay, good--

00:22.273 --> 00:24.639
Now, I need you
to get your game face on

00:24.901 --> 00:27.768
because someone is
breaking into the house!

00:28.029 --> 00:29.769
[Bang on door]

00:32.033 --> 00:32.863
Uh, I'm sorry--

00:33.117 --> 00:35.608
Am I interrupting
your soft ball game?

00:35.870 --> 00:37.360
Could you please grab
a big girl weapon?

00:37.622 --> 00:39.613
Uh, Kenzi, I am
a big girl weapon.

00:39.874 --> 00:41.785
What, you think I can't
handle a few robbers?

00:42.043 --> 00:43.453
"Robbers",
my fine Russian ass.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.746
This is probably
payback because

00:45.004 --> 00:46.585
you and Dyson cheated
on your Fae Finals--

00:46.839 --> 00:47.248
Hey,
I did not cheat!

00:47.506 --> 00:50.998
--and now they've sent some
revenge Fae for our skin!

00:51.260 --> 00:52.796
Or our tonsils.
[Banging on door]

00:54.847 --> 00:55.882
Sh--

01:05.900 --> 01:06.514
Ahh!

01:06.776 --> 01:08.016
[Clatter!]

01:09.862 --> 01:11.193
Lauren!

01:11.906 --> 01:12.986
Ta-da?

01:17.745 --> 01:18.575
Surprising you
with breakfast

01:18.829 --> 01:21.286
went a lot
better in my head.

01:23.209 --> 01:24.415
So...

01:26.921 --> 01:28.832
The Dawning...

01:29.090 --> 01:30.421
Intense, huh?

01:31.717 --> 01:33.218
|ntensely reinvigorating.

01:33.469 --> 01:36.302
| feel reborn, Lauren.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.682
Like I had this moment
of realization that I am

01:38.933 --> 01:42.767
part of something
bigger than myself.

01:43.020 --> 01:43.429
Bo--

01:43.688 --> 01:45.849
KENZI: Is everyone
in here non-naked?

01:46.107 --> 01:48.348
Sorry, I just
forgot Geraldine.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.277
I love you guys!

01:50.861 --> 01:51.816
Ugh--

01:52.071 --> 01:54.312
You are always playing
the domestic goddess.

01:54.573 --> 01:55.483
It is my turn.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.447
You're gonna... cook?

01:57.702 --> 02:00.068
I'm pretty sure I can
crack an egg, Kenzi.

02:00.997 --> 02:02.578
How hard can it be?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.871
[Whispering] This is
not the Bo that I recall.

02:08.129 --> 02:09.084
So, what d'ya say,
Doc? Body swap?

02:09.338 --> 02:12.250
Morrigan parasite?
Last night's sushi,

02:12.508 --> 02:15.170
which I totally might've
gotten at the dollar store...

02:15.428 --> 02:16.463
The Dawning
has changed her

02:16.721 --> 02:19.053
and we knew
that it would.

02:19.307 --> 02:23.266
The important thing is,
she's still our Bo.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.601
Right?

02:25.855 --> 02:26.810
Yes...

02:30.735 --> 02:32.225
...They're not
gonna change me.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.068
They can make me write
my feelings in a journal,

02:35.323 --> 02:38.656
play team-building games
'til I'm blue in the face.

02:38.909 --> 02:43.073
But they will not take
the brat outta Matt.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.040
That reminds me...

02:48.294 --> 02:49.875
...take your top off.

02:53.799 --> 02:57.542
Okay, but for the record:
I still think this is stupid.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.670
Yeah, well, stupid things
can be sexy too. Look at me.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.512
[Laughing]

03:02.767 --> 03:04.723
Alright--
Close your eyes.

03:05.144 --> 03:07.977
I'm telling you, it makes
all your sense sharper.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.308
Fine.
Pervert.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.191
Tell me what you feel.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.320
That's your breath.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.826
That's your mouth.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.045
Grass?

03:39.303 --> 03:40.418
No.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.881
Feather?

03:44.266 --> 03:44.971
[Giggling]

03:45.226 --> 03:47.933
You're right,
this is kinda sexy.

03:51.524 --> 03:53.435
Hel-lo?

03:54.652 --> 03:55.937
Matt?

04:03.828 --> 04:04.943
Matt?

04:07.665 --> 04:09.030
Very fu n ny!

04:11.836 --> 04:14.498
Get me all hot and
bothered and then leave?

04:16.465 --> 04:17.250
Yeah, you were right
about one thing, Matt!

04:17.508 --> 04:19.044
You are stupid!

04:23.597 --> 04:25.133
Ah!
Ahh--

04:25.891 --> 04:26.971
Ahh!

04:27.726 --> 04:30.308
[Struggling]

04:30.563 --> 04:31.643
[Muffled]
Help me!

04:32.690 --> 04:34.430
Ahh!
Ahhh!

04:37.820 --> 04:40.653
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.318
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

04:43.576 --> 04:45.532
My love carries
a death sentence.

04:46.579 --> 04:48.535
I was lost for years...

04:48.789 --> 04:50.404
Searching while hiding.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.867
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.044
I won't hide anymore.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.755
I will live
the life I choose.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.594
Ugh...

05:09.852 --> 05:10.386
Ugh!

05:10.644 --> 05:11.474
Where is this "camp?"

05:11.729 --> 05:13.139
And why does Freddy
Krueger live there?

05:13.397 --> 05:15.353
Well, I know you said
they're just teenagers,

05:15.608 --> 05:17.144
but they still
seem so young.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.686
And yikes--

05:18.944 --> 05:20.935
These are some
crazy rap sheets.

05:21.197 --> 05:23.358
Yeah, most of these kids
slipped through the system.

05:23.616 --> 05:25.277
Had to fend
for themselves.

05:25.618 --> 05:26.733
Why isn't
Tamsin in on this?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.359
She's off
for a few days.

05:28.621 --> 05:30.157
Some dustup
in a Dark Fae bar.

05:30.414 --> 05:30.778
Oh--

05:31.040 --> 05:32.371
[Laughing]

05:32.625 --> 05:33.910
Kind of my fault.

05:36.212 --> 05:37.952
Funny story, great
ending. 'Nother time.

05:38.214 --> 05:39.795
Why do you need us?

05:40.633 --> 05:42.794
Well, the latest death
was this morning.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.008
Matt Michaels, 19.

05:45.262 --> 05:45.967
I'm going over
the crime scene,

05:46.222 --> 05:47.587
but I need
a protection detail

05:47.848 --> 05:48.963
for the rest
of the campers.

05:49.225 --> 05:50.305
Kenzi, wondering
how you feel

05:50.559 --> 05:52.015
about tapping into
your inner juvie?

05:52.394 --> 05:53.770
Camp's not
really my thing...

05:56.190 --> 05:57.555
I'll make it work.

05:57.816 --> 05:58.521
Thank you.

05:58.776 --> 05:59.561
And, Bo...

05:59.818 --> 06:00.682
l was wondering if--

06:00.945 --> 06:02.025
Please say
camp counselor.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.143
[Laughing]

06:03.405 --> 06:05.145
If you wanted to be
a camp counselor.

06:05.407 --> 06:05.941
Yes!

06:06.200 --> 06:06.950
You're okay
with that?

06:07.201 --> 06:08.111
l'm awesome with that!

06:08.369 --> 06:09.950
Camp Chipewa, voted
most popular counselor

06:11.789 --> 06:12.699
Should have known.

06:12.957 --> 06:14.413
Okay, you guys
got bags to pack.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.123
Yes, and l have
to tell Lauren!

06:16.377 --> 06:16.866
Kenz, you comin'?

06:17.127 --> 06:18.287
Right behind ya.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.377
What's that look for?

06:24.635 --> 06:26.375
This look wonders...

06:26.637 --> 06:28.844
how the wolfman is
doing post-Bo's Dawning.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.180
Fine.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.265
Ehhh!
I'm afraid that is

06:34.520 --> 06:36.351
not the answer we
were looking for!

06:36.605 --> 06:38.641
Really, Kenzi.
I am...

06:38.899 --> 06:40.139
...fine.

06:40.401 --> 06:41.356
Fine.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.565
Fine.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.941
Ow...

06:46.198 --> 06:47.483
Good, you're tapping
the inner juvie already.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.652
Go get 'em,
badass.

06:53.831 --> 06:56.072
Two dead, a monster-y
maniac on the loose

06:56.333 --> 06:59.496
and a gaggle ofjuicy teen
campers, ripe for the picking.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.584
We didn't have any
of that at Camp Chipewa.

07:01.839 --> 07:02.999
Wow.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.007
Suddenly I'm glad I opted

07:04.258 --> 07:05.748
for space camp
when l was a kid.

07:06.010 --> 07:08.592
This "Treeman" is about
to get chopped down.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.928
He ain't got nothing
on Lady Lumberjack.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.307
Are you worried about me
going undercover with Dyson?

07:15.561 --> 07:17.597
Because you know
that you can trust me.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.564
l was just hoping that we could
have this weekend to talk.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.523
I'm sorry, ljust--

07:23.777 --> 07:25.608
| sort of need this.
You know?

07:25.863 --> 07:29.731
To take down something big
and ferocious and murder-y.

07:29.992 --> 07:32.950
We've just been a little bit
out of sync lately, that's all.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.333
I know.

07:40.628 --> 07:42.164
And that is my fault.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.956
But now that
The Dawning is over,

07:47.217 --> 07:48.798
things are
gonna get better.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.877
I promise.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.304
You know that I
would much rather

07:54.558 --> 07:56.674
be spending the
weekend with you.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.635
Blame Tamsin!

08:11.408 --> 08:12.363
Oh!

08:14.203 --> 08:15.534
Acacia?

08:15.788 --> 08:16.994
Hey lady.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.699
And here I thought
I'd taught you

08:21.960 --> 08:23.496
to never drop
your guard.

08:23.754 --> 08:26.336
Well, you also taught me
to respect my elders.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.581
Oh, you cheeky bitch.

08:28.842 --> 08:29.957
How the hell
have you been?

08:30.219 --> 08:30.833
Good.

08:31.095 --> 08:31.880
And you've never
looked better.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.422
Hmm...
Damn straight.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.764
So, what brings you to my
corner of our Dark little world?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.759
I am here to deliver
a message.

08:42.606 --> 08:43.846
He knows you found her.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.518
Now it's time
to finish the job.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.153
BO: This is camp?

08:56.412 --> 08:59.870
I'm thinking this one begins
with the letters P.O.W.

09:00.124 --> 09:01.204
This is nature?

09:01.458 --> 09:05.371
Discovery Channel lead me to
believe there'd be more green.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.244
You go first.
Go ahead.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.213
Camp Chipewa?

09:10.926 --> 09:12.427
Uh, yeah--

09:12.678 --> 09:14.839
When I took the job,
| sort of thought

09:15.097 --> 09:16.962
it would be another
kind of camp.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.131
Devoid of murder
you mean?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.599
Look, I'm sorry
about Matt.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.474
Do you want to talk
about what you saw?

09:24.732 --> 09:26.814
No one cares what
someone like me thinks.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.854
It might be hard for
you to believe, but--

09:31.113 --> 09:33.229
lam someone like you.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.814
Oh yeah?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.111
You ever stab anyone?

09:38.829 --> 09:41.445
Yes... actually.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.241
Look, the thing is,
I didn't "see" anything.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.458
My eyes were closed.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.328
That was the whole point
of the stupid game.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.046
What game?

09:51.300 --> 09:53.962
Matt got me to close
my eyes while he--

09:55.763 --> 09:56.923
...y'know.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.590
Said my other senses
would be "heightened".

10:00.851 --> 10:02.637
[Whispering]
Dork...

10:02.895 --> 10:04.055
Were they?

10:06.064 --> 10:07.850
Actually...

10:08.108 --> 10:09.439
...yeah.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.229
That's why
I smelled smoke.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.480
What kind of smoke?

10:14.364 --> 10:15.820
Like when you're...

10:16.074 --> 10:18.656
...straightening your
hair and you burn it.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.159
I don't want to sound flaky
but there's something

10:21.413 --> 10:23.654
about this place
that's just off.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.031
I mean, even
more "off" than me.

10:26.502 --> 10:28.788
Della, what you've gone
through is not your fault.

10:30.756 --> 10:33.839
And if you ever want
to talk about it...

10:34.092 --> 10:35.298
I'm here.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.470
[Under breath]
Whatever...

10:39.056 --> 10:40.216
Can I go now?

10:40.891 --> 10:42.097
Sure.

10:45.062 --> 10:46.097
Thanks.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.936
This is where
we found him.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.980
I hope we can learn
more from the autopsy.

10:56.073 --> 10:57.859
Dr. Lewis is very good.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.315
Are there any registered
Fae in this zone

11:00.577 --> 11:01.657
with this sort of M.O.?

11:01.912 --> 11:03.823
None that I haven't
already ruled out.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.821
Besides, all the kills
have been different.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.244
One was stomped
to death, another burned,

11:08.502 --> 11:09.457
a few were strangled.

11:09.711 --> 11:10.461
[Sniffing]

11:10.712 --> 11:12.543
If there's a pattern here,
I can't see it.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.709
And where were you when
the attack took place?

11:14.967 --> 11:16.628
Here.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.001
|'m attached to these
grounds literally.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.424
Lares?

11:21.682 --> 11:22.637
You got it.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.559
You never seen
anything like this before?

11:29.064 --> 11:31.055
Probably just
some human litter.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.433
Maybe.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.356
The campers, they're
free to roam around?

11:37.072 --> 11:38.937
Within reason,
yes. Why?

11:41.285 --> 11:43.025
I don't think it's safe.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.077
We're gonna have to do
something about that.

11:49.293 --> 11:56.256
[Stereo music playing]

12:05.267 --> 12:06.222
What up?

12:06.476 --> 12:08.683
Yep.
She's a narc.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.137
Narc-ing's not
really my style.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.102
What are you
in the program for?

12:14.359 --> 12:17.021
Theft, explosives,
devil may care attitude...

12:17.279 --> 12:18.985
Explosives, huh?

12:19.698 --> 12:20.858
Wow.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.240
Pipe bombs: what do
you make 'em with?

12:24.494 --> 12:25.654
Talc, or baby powder?

12:25.913 --> 12:27.949
Talc-- unless you're
bombing diaper rash.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.663
Easiest lock to pick:
cylinder or rim?

12:30.918 --> 12:33.284
They both suck,
but I prefer a rim.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.248
Alright,
your turn:

12:37.007 --> 12:37.996
you're walking
down the street,

12:38.258 --> 12:40.294
you see a sweet
cherry '92 Jag.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.964
You get in, you hear sirens,
you have three minutes.

12:43.221 --> 12:44.347
You take the car,
or the pieces?

12:44.598 --> 12:45.303
Both.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.263
Trick question.
You take nothing.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.428
Market's been cold on
British imports since '02,

12:49.686 --> 12:51.802
so you're better off
ripping a domestic.

12:52.064 --> 12:54.521
Only a punk or a poser
would risk getting collared

12:54.775 --> 12:57.357
for half a hun' of dead
merch they can't push.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.233
We cool?

13:03.992 --> 13:05.368
Yeah.

13:09.081 --> 13:09.820
Nice ink, man.

13:10.082 --> 13:11.822
Yeah, it's my
girlfriend's name.

13:12.084 --> 13:13.369
In what, Klingon?

13:13.627 --> 13:14.787
Something like that.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.250
We're forever.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.879
So, what do you guys do
around here for kicks?

13:21.885 --> 13:23.967
You lead one battalion
astray and suddenly

13:24.221 --> 13:27.634
the entire War of 1812
goes to the Canadians.

13:27.891 --> 13:28.471
[Laughing]

13:28.725 --> 13:29.840
Well, they
wanted it more.

13:30.102 --> 13:31.467
Plus you were
the one who brought

13:31.728 --> 13:33.229
the maple
syrup whiskey.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.643
Yes, and I also
brought Tecumseh.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.436
Mmm...
Tecumseh.

13:38.694 --> 13:39.854
Now there
was a general.

13:40.112 --> 13:41.898
Mmm.
There was a man.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.272
They don't make
warriors like that anymore.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.405
They made you, Acacia.

13:49.663 --> 13:50.618
[Chuckling]

13:51.915 --> 13:54.156
All right...
Enough for me.

13:54.418 --> 13:55.373
l'm drivin'.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.456
How long are we
going to pretend

13:58.714 --> 14:00.875
that you're not
in serious trouble here?

14:01.508 --> 14:02.258
l'll figure it out.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.715
Really? How?

14:08.265 --> 14:09.095
I don't know!

14:09.349 --> 14:10.759
I'll find someone
else he wants more

14:11.018 --> 14:12.224
and I'll make a trade.

14:12.477 --> 14:16.061
Name one person he
wants more than this girl.

14:19.026 --> 14:19.811
You've never
choked before.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.855
And I'm not
choking now!

14:23.113 --> 14:26.025
Look, this is not just
some skip we're bagging.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.820
You know what happens when
we deliver a mark, Acacia.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.658
Mmmhmm.
We get paid.

14:30.912 --> 14:31.867
| buy things.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.113
The world
keeps spinning.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.823
It's what we do, Tamz.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.827
We find people
and we bring them in.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.168
That's the job.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.459
Look...

14:43.717 --> 14:45.799
Even if I wanted to,
she's been through

14:46.053 --> 14:48.009
the Dawning.
She's too strong, now--

14:49.056 --> 14:50.842
He has thought
of that.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.429
What the hell is it?

14:58.690 --> 15:00.226
Rune glass.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.854
"One hair from someone
she loves.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.942
"Two from someone
she trusts.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.983
"And three
from her own head."

15:07.699 --> 15:08.859
Put 'em
in the bottle,

15:09.117 --> 15:11.073
and the Druid
will do the rest.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.903
"Do the rest" how?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.371
Bitch, do I look
like a wizard?

15:17.834 --> 15:19.825
I don't know,
put the whammy on her!

15:20.087 --> 15:22.169
Make her putty
in your hands.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.251
I took this gig
because I thought

15:25.509 --> 15:27.841
it would be easy money
talking sense into you.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.380
Don't let me down.

15:29.638 --> 15:32.425
And don't get any deeper
in this than you have to.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.388
Just bring in the girl.
Okay?

15:36.061 --> 15:36.846
Okay.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.844
Okay.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.017
Well, it's
a beautiful day--

15:41.691 --> 15:43.977
I think I'll walk.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.696
Ok, so we'll start with a
good old-fashioned game

15:57.958 --> 16:00.244
of basketball to really
get our heart pumping,

16:00.502 --> 16:02.959
and then we'll talk a little
bit about how we feel.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.124
Um, I feel this is
amateur hour bullshit.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.918
Yeah, I feel like not
getting murdered.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.460
Which we might,
out here.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.174
Okay!

16:10.428 --> 16:13.716
Okay, so, um,
let's, let's--

16:14.266 --> 16:15.176
Everyone on your feet!

16:15.433 --> 16:16.809
Okay, let's try
something different.

16:17.060 --> 16:17.970
It'll be fun--

16:18.228 --> 16:20.389
We're gonna work on
team building and trust.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.808
So, get up, everyone!
Pair up!

16:23.066 --> 16:25.182
Uh, so, who wants
to be my partner?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.820
Okay, how 'bout you,
Kenz?

16:32.117 --> 16:33.152
Lame.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.822
Ok, so when I fall, I know
that she will catch me,

16:36.079 --> 16:37.865
because I completely
trust my team.

16:38.123 --> 16:38.612
Ready?

16:38.874 --> 16:41.365
Three... two... one!

16:42.711 --> 16:43.245
BO: Ugh!

16:43.503 --> 16:45.619
[Laughing]

16:49.301 --> 16:51.417
Can I talk to you
for a second? Please--

16:51.678 --> 16:53.543
Of course.

16:53.805 --> 16:54.920
Are you seriously
going to pretend

16:55.182 --> 16:56.262
that wasn't
the funniest shit

16:56.516 --> 16:58.302
in the history of both
"funny" and "shit?

16:58.560 --> 16:59.845
I need these kids
to respect me.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.936
Au contraire, mon frere:
you need them to trust me.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.646
And after
taking down The Man,

17:04.900 --> 17:06.811
lam like a folk hero
to these delinks.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.979
I am like
their Che Guevera.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.397
Do you even know
who that is?

17:10.655 --> 17:11.906
Dude in the beret.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.818
Designs tee shirts
for angry youth.

17:14.075 --> 17:17.033
Ugh-- So tell me,
Che, any intel so far?

17:17.287 --> 17:19.653
Well, Della is obviously,
a mental mess.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.247
Uh, this one kid, Nelson,
he's semi-confrontational.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.832
And the rest are just
various remixes of angry.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.872
Yes, they are tough
kids, but they can't

17:27.130 --> 17:28.666
defend themselves against
whatever is stalking them.

17:28.924 --> 17:29.879
They got skillz.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.088
From where,
the street?

17:31.343 --> 17:32.799
Hey! Don't knock
the streets, lady.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.793
The streets
taught me a lot.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.795
I got skillz.
I can be badass.

17:37.057 --> 17:37.842
I'm sure you can.

17:38.099 --> 17:39.760
But this isn't
a human monster, Kenzi.

17:40.018 --> 17:40.848
This is
a monster monster.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.808
As in serious.
As in you need

17:43.063 --> 17:44.178
to come get me
and Dyson

17:44.439 --> 17:45.519
if things get real.
Okay?

17:45.774 --> 17:45.853
Fine.

17:46.107 --> 17:46.311
Okay?

17:46.566 --> 17:46.850
Yes.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.848
Good.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.601
Okay, everyone let's meet
Jolene in the lunch room.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.687
It is taco Tuesday!

18:23.103 --> 18:24.343
Come on D-man...

18:25.480 --> 18:27.220
A wolf's gotta shed...

18:41.288 --> 18:43.028
Jackpot.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.844
Anyone else think that
these deaths might be

19:45.101 --> 19:46.841
some sort of freaky
animal attack?

19:47.187 --> 19:48.051
Like a wolf?

19:48.313 --> 19:50.019
A wolf wouldn't leave
the body intact.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.102
Yeah, not to mention,
they're really lame.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.149
Oh, really?

19:55.487 --> 19:57.318
Yeah, and
surprisingly girly.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.730
I think you protest too much.
I think you love wolves.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.232
Wolves wish
I loved them.

20:02.494 --> 20:03.825
Enough with
the weird wolf talk.

20:04.079 --> 20:05.819
Yeah, who the hell
are you?

20:06.081 --> 20:08.072
Name's Dyson.
| work with Jolene.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.615
Another social worker?
Great.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.413
Just what we need to protect
us from a crazed killer.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.001
Yeah, what are
you gonna do?

20:14.255 --> 20:15.711
Pipe self-actualizations
through the intercom

20:15.965 --> 20:18.798
'til the killer surrenders
to a group hug?

20:19.052 --> 20:20.758
No, but we do
have a plan

20:21.012 --> 20:23.219
and it involves all
of you staying together.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.225
I hope you realize this
is for your own good.

20:36.277 --> 20:39.144
What the hell do you
mean you threw it away?!

20:39.906 --> 20:43.444
You have to take care of that
unaligned Succubus bitch!

20:44.077 --> 20:45.942
Her name is Bo!

20:47.080 --> 20:48.741
Are you shitting me?

20:49.499 --> 20:52.616
It is my problem and I will
deal with it in my way!

20:52.877 --> 20:54.287
It was your problem.

20:54.546 --> 20:57.208
Until I guaranteed that
you would finish the job!

20:57.674 --> 21:00.086
Why would you do such
a dumb-ass thing?!

21:00.343 --> 21:01.583
Because I trust you--

21:01.845 --> 21:02.800
I never asked you to!

21:03.054 --> 21:04.794
Do you remember who
we're dealing with?

21:05.056 --> 21:07.798
If you betray him, there is
not a place in this world

21:08.059 --> 21:11.222
that his freaky little
minions will not find you!

21:11.479 --> 21:12.514
Or you.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.229
Finish the job, Tamsin.
Deliver the Succubus.

21:18.486 --> 21:19.692
Or I will.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.355
Even if I have
to go through you.

21:31.875 --> 21:32.990
We gotta
break out of here.

21:33.251 --> 21:34.991
Yeah, and find the
creep that's stalking us.

21:35.253 --> 21:36.413
We're all gonna die.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.211
That is not
happening, trust me.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.001
No one cares about us.

21:40.383 --> 21:42.624
They've got all the power
and we've got nothing.

21:42.886 --> 21:43.750
They like us weak.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.127
They like us
dependant on them.

21:45.388 --> 21:46.844
Yeah, until something
like this come along,

21:47.098 --> 21:49.510
then it's good luck, sayonara,
you're all on your own.

21:49.767 --> 21:50.973
Like I said--

21:51.227 --> 21:52.057
We're all going to die.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.051
No!

21:53.313 --> 21:54.769
We're gonna get
out of this room

21:55.023 --> 21:56.854
and we are going to show
that murdering freak

21:57.108 --> 21:58.518
why you don't
mess with delinquents!

21:58.776 --> 22:00.732
I'd slow clap if
that wasn't so lame.

22:01.362 --> 22:02.863
One exit strategy
coming up.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.445
Uh, no, no, no!
Honey-- Honey!

22:04.699 --> 22:05.563
It's okay, it's okay--

22:05.825 --> 22:07.406
Uh, somebody got
a stolen credit card?

22:10.121 --> 22:11.281
Alright.

22:14.417 --> 22:15.873
Oh, okay, alright, guys,
what's the plan?

22:16.127 --> 22:17.833
I think it's
best if we stick--

22:18.087 --> 22:19.702
Stick together!
Guys!

22:19.964 --> 22:21.829
Guys, I said
stick together!

22:22.091 --> 22:24.798
So, Matt's entire body
was full of leaves?

22:25.053 --> 22:27.009
And twigs, and bark.

22:27.263 --> 22:28.799
Oh, that is horrible.

22:30.058 --> 22:32.845
The worst part is that
it would have taken hours

22:33.102 --> 22:34.512
to stuff his body.

22:34.771 --> 22:36.011
Oh, God...

22:36.272 --> 22:38.649
He wasn't only killed,
he was tortured.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.765
The strange thing about
this particular foliage is

22:41.027 --> 22:42.858
that it comes from
a species of tree

22:43.112 --> 22:44.648
that no longer
grows in the area.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.646
But why toy
with him like that?

22:46.991 --> 22:48.197
Revenge?

22:48.451 --> 22:49.816
Send him a message?
I don't know, Bo.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.818
But whatever it is,
just please promise me

22:52.080 --> 22:53.240
that you'll be careful.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.159
Yes, of course.

22:55.667 --> 22:56.998
And when this
is over, babe,

22:57.252 --> 22:59.243
I think you and
I should get away.

22:59.504 --> 23:00.960
Maybe someplace with sand.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.499
You ever seen Egypt?

23:03.216 --> 23:04.422
Actually, twice.

23:04.801 --> 23:05.506
Oh!

23:05.760 --> 23:07.216
Sorry Miss Blasé
World Traveler.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.301
You could at least
fake some enthusiasm.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.421
It's just that I'm
busy with my stuff

23:11.683 --> 23:12.843
you're busy
with your stuff--

23:13.101 --> 23:14.136
It's--

23:14.394 --> 23:15.759
Yeah, but your
stuff is my stuff

23:16.020 --> 23:17.885
and my stuff is
your stuff and--

23:18.147 --> 23:19.762
Well, now
I'm just confused.

23:21.568 --> 23:21.977
Bo!

23:22.235 --> 23:22.439
But, |--

23:22.694 --> 23:23.058
BO!

23:23.570 --> 23:24.059
Ugh--

23:24.320 --> 23:25.821
No, no!
Oh God!

23:26.072 --> 23:28.233
[Bo struggling]

23:28.491 --> 23:31.824
[Phone ringing]

23:32.078 --> 23:32.783
Dyson .

23:33.037 --> 23:33.662
Dyson!

23:33.913 --> 23:34.902
Dyson,
it's attacking her!

23:35.164 --> 23:36.119
Lauren, slow down--

23:36.374 --> 23:38.831
Bo is in her room!
It's attacking her, just go!

23:39.085 --> 23:40.040
I'm on my way--

23:41.045 --> 23:43.422
[Bo struggling]

23:43.673 --> 23:44.628
[Slam!]

23:48.177 --> 23:48.802
Uhhh!

23:49.470 --> 23:51.210
BO: Ugh!

23:51.472 --> 23:52.632
[Muffled]
Bo!

23:52.890 --> 23:54.050
[Slam!]

23:55.893 --> 23:59.101
[Bo struggling]

23:59.355 --> 23:59.889
Ugh!

24:00.148 --> 24:01.638
Rawr!
[Glass breaking]

24:02.900 --> 24:04.640
[Bo coughing]

24:04.902 --> 24:07.063
I'm fine--
Go after it.

24:15.538 --> 24:16.618
Oh!

24:16.873 --> 24:18.955
Fancy meeting you here!

24:19.208 --> 24:20.789
Okay, the good news
is we're all still here.

24:21.044 --> 24:23.000
Bad news, we've
all kind of scattered.

24:23.463 --> 24:26.205
Come on, stay close--
Do not fall behind.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.626
You guys find anything?

24:28.092 --> 24:29.343
Just our favourite
shit disturber here--

24:29.594 --> 24:31.130
Kenzi, where are
the other campers?

24:31.387 --> 24:32.888
They're-- around.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.218
What?

24:36.476 --> 24:37.431
Burning hair.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.432
I say run, you run.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.645
No argument
from this one.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.398
[Gagging]

25:35.660 --> 25:37.616
Acacia...

25:47.964 --> 25:51.047
Disorientation...
smell of burning hair.

25:51.551 --> 25:52.586
Oh God...

25:52.844 --> 25:54.630
Sounds like
a Tikbalang to me.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.139
Albert Einstein!

25:57.765 --> 25:58.845
Sorry...

25:59.600 --> 26:01.101
Your door was open...

26:01.352 --> 26:02.933
Yeah, I was trying to--

26:03.396 --> 26:05.136
What did you call it?
A Tik-what?

26:05.398 --> 26:06.558
Tikbalang.

26:07.316 --> 26:08.726
They're forest creatures.

26:08.985 --> 26:10.941
I hunted them
in the Phillippines.

26:11.779 --> 26:12.894
Yeah.

26:13.156 --> 26:16.523
It says here that they disorient
travelers to lead them away.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.649
That they're as
strong as a horse--

26:19.954 --> 26:21.034
Eyelash.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.245
Oh.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.616
What are you doing here?

26:28.004 --> 26:32.122
You're not really a...
big fan of me, are you?

26:32.383 --> 26:34.499
Well, in light
of recent events, no.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.723
Is this about the kiss?

26:42.977 --> 26:44.717
Between Bo and |?

26:52.361 --> 26:53.316
What?

26:54.739 --> 26:57.822
Because it was
only that once.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.361
Wasn't really that big a deal.

27:00.620 --> 27:04.863
Heck-- she didn't
even feed off of me.

27:07.668 --> 27:08.202
[Slap!]

27:13.341 --> 27:15.627
Guess I deserved that.

27:17.345 --> 27:19.006
Get out.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.419
If it wasn't for me,
Della would still be alive.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.083
That is not true.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.127
If you're gonna
blame anyone, blame me.

27:57.385 --> 27:58.625
l was sent
to find this monster

27:58.886 --> 28:00.968
in a puppet costume
but I failed, me.

28:01.222 --> 28:02.302
No, it doesn't
even matter.

28:02.557 --> 28:04.889
Either way, the campers
are not gonna trust me now.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.224
They'll be here any minute.

28:07.478 --> 28:08.888
Maybe I should go.

28:09.939 --> 28:11.725
LAUREN: No one's
going anywhere.

28:11.983 --> 28:13.393
Not with what
we're dealing with.

28:13.651 --> 28:14.766
Hey...

28:16.362 --> 28:17.522
It's a Tikbalang.

28:17.780 --> 28:18.860
A tickle bang?

28:19.115 --> 28:21.197
Sounds strangely fun
and easy to beat.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.532
Yeah, it's not.
I looked it up.

28:23.786 --> 28:26.493
The only way to beat it
is to literally smoke it out.

28:26.747 --> 28:28.123
Once you catch it,
you have to cut its mane.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.285
That's where its
willpower lies.

28:30.543 --> 28:32.158
No hair, no fight.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.706
Translation: We smoke it
out and give it a makeover.

28:34.964 --> 28:36.079
The makeover we can do.

28:36.340 --> 28:37.125
And the smoke--

28:37.383 --> 28:39.169
DYSON: Come on in!
Put your bags in a pile.

28:39.427 --> 28:41.008
We'll figure out
sleeping arrangements later.

28:41.262 --> 28:43.344
Wow, we're just moving
from one shithole to another.

28:43.598 --> 28:46.180
I'm not gonna stay here to be
bait for whatever's out there.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.095
--You can't go.
--Watch us.

28:48.352 --> 28:48.886
KENZI: Guys!

28:49.145 --> 28:50.260
Guys, look,
I know you're scared.

28:50.521 --> 28:51.897
I am too.
But my friends?

28:52.148 --> 28:53.513
They are really good at this.

28:53.774 --> 28:54.524
Stronger than me.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.151
They will find
this murderer.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.437
BO: She's right.
We will.

28:57.695 --> 29:00.482
What if they could make the
killer pay for Della and Matt?

29:00.740 --> 29:01.855
And what if you could
help them do it?

29:02.116 --> 29:02.980
Kenz, where
are you going with this?

29:03.242 --> 29:04.482
You have some
sort of genius plan?

29:04.744 --> 29:06.200
Actually, I do.

29:06.454 --> 29:09.161
Who here knows how
to make pipe bombs?

29:11.459 --> 29:12.414
Yeah.

29:15.963 --> 29:17.749
I hope this works.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.497
Smoking prey out is
a hunting technique

29:19.759 --> 29:21.966
that's been used since
the beginning of time.

29:24.388 --> 29:25.719
Do we need to talk
about what happened

29:25.973 --> 29:27.759
at The Dawning?

29:28.017 --> 29:30.008
Because I need
to talk about it.

29:30.770 --> 29:31.509
Okay.

29:33.773 --> 29:37.140
I need you to know...
that I appreciate

29:37.401 --> 29:38.732
so much...

29:38.986 --> 29:41.022
what you were
willing to risk for me.

29:42.323 --> 29:43.483
But...

29:43.741 --> 29:45.697
I also need you
to know that

29:45.952 --> 29:47.943
lam still in love with Lauren.

29:50.331 --> 29:51.286
All right.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.038
"All right"?

29:55.753 --> 29:56.868
Bo...

29:58.089 --> 29:59.545
I think the tales
of my romantic heroism

29:59.799 --> 30:01.835
may have been
slightly exaggerated.

30:02.093 --> 30:04.675
You volunteered
to be my Hand,

30:04.929 --> 30:07.090
knowing you weren't
getting out alive.

30:07.348 --> 30:09.134
Then why
aren't I dead?

30:10.226 --> 30:12.308
We've been through
a lot together, Bo.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.722
And the main thing
I've learned in that time?

30:14.981 --> 30:17.313
Is that the people
who underestimate you...

30:17.817 --> 30:18.977
...always lose.

30:20.361 --> 30:22.898
When I volunteered,
I wasn't risking my life:

30:23.948 --> 30:26.109
l was trusting that
you would save it.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.031
Tell me the truth...

30:37.837 --> 30:40.203
Was it hard dating me?

30:42.717 --> 30:45.129
It was harder losing you.

30:50.975 --> 30:53.717
Y'know, even after everything
that we have been through...

30:55.771 --> 30:57.727
I'm really glad
we ended up here.

30:59.191 --> 31:02.433
[Steam escaping]

31:02.695 --> 31:03.605
That's our cue.

31:03.863 --> 31:05.569
Go. I'll go
around the side.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.448
[Whack!]

31:12.663 --> 31:14.403
Not fun fighting
for air, is it?

31:17.418 --> 31:18.533
Jolene...

31:19.545 --> 31:21.126
You let me go!

31:21.881 --> 31:23.291
Let me think about that?

31:23.549 --> 31:24.129
No!

31:24.383 --> 31:26.089
They deserve to die.

31:26.343 --> 31:27.469
Painfully.

31:27.887 --> 31:29.252
And you deserve
a haircut.

31:33.350 --> 31:37.844
Ahhh!

31:38.105 --> 31:39.436
[Crying]

31:43.152 --> 31:44.107
See?

31:44.361 --> 31:46.818
Classic hunting technique.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.806
'Sup, Doc.

32:20.147 --> 32:21.387
They're called caltrops.

32:21.649 --> 32:23.685
You still
workin' on it?

32:23.943 --> 32:24.523
You wanna tell him?

32:24.777 --> 32:27.109
Yeah, sorry, Trick,
we just closed the case.

32:27.363 --> 32:28.478
Oh!

32:29.490 --> 32:30.115
Well--

32:30.366 --> 32:31.697
They're pretty
fascinating actually--

32:31.951 --> 32:33.987
Part of an old
Fae hunting game.

32:34.245 --> 32:35.985
Used by an
obscure Fae sect.

32:36.831 --> 32:39.117
They mark the prey
with the caltrops.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.991
I've seen this before.
This is... Klingon.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.087
Close.

32:44.338 --> 32:46.329
It's the Filipino
language of Baybayin,

32:46.590 --> 32:49.127
a pre-Spanish
Phillippine writing system.

32:49.385 --> 32:51.046
Blah, blah
whatever writing system--

32:51.303 --> 32:53.715
Nelson had a tatt in this
language on his arm.

32:53.973 --> 32:56.089
Said it belonged
to his girlfriend.

32:56.350 --> 32:57.100
Uh-oh.

32:57.351 --> 32:58.261
What uh-oh?

32:58.519 --> 33:00.009
Mates hunt in pairs.

33:00.521 --> 33:01.101
Which means...

33:01.355 --> 33:02.856
Nelson's going to kill again.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.646
Uh-oh, the doc--

33:04.900 --> 33:05.480
What about her?

33:05.734 --> 33:06.894
She was talking to Nelson,

33:07.153 --> 33:08.313
all kinds of smack
about Jolene--

33:08.571 --> 33:10.732
I don't know about you,
but I'd be supremely pissed.

33:10.990 --> 33:13.026
Call Dyson, tell him
to meet me at Lauren's--

33:15.161 --> 33:16.992
Oh... brother.

33:17.663 --> 33:18.743
Ahh!

33:20.207 --> 33:21.913
[Whack!]

33:22.168 --> 33:23.283
[Heavy breathing]

33:23.544 --> 33:25.409
Get up--
Come on, come on--

33:25.963 --> 33:27.078
There we go,
I got you--

33:27.339 --> 33:28.294
Get up!

33:31.343 --> 33:32.503
What do you
want from me?

33:32.761 --> 33:34.501
Nothing personal,
just the chance

33:34.763 --> 33:36.094
to end the game
with a little dignity.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.464
Hey, hey,
shhh, shhh, shh, shh--

33:38.726 --> 33:40.512
Doctors know
about symmetry, right?

33:40.769 --> 33:41.474
Right?

33:41.729 --> 33:44.266
Well, your girlfriend took my
girlfriend, ruined our game.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.059
So now,
I'm gonna ruin you.

33:46.317 --> 33:49.275
[Wheezing]
Are you gonna kill me?

33:49.528 --> 33:52.486
Yeah, I have to.
It's the rules.

33:53.324 --> 33:55.280
Here, look.
Look. Just look.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.529
l marked you
for my girl, see?

33:58.787 --> 34:01.278
[Lauren choking]
Now she's gone--

34:01.540 --> 34:02.996
But you're human...

34:03.542 --> 34:04.531
Well, you know
what it's like!

34:04.793 --> 34:06.249
You know what
it's like, I mean--

34:06.503 --> 34:09.290
You're nothing, nobody,
then one of them

34:09.548 --> 34:13.507
comes along, looks
at you and touches you.

34:14.762 --> 34:17.299
How do you go back
to a mortal life after that?

34:17.556 --> 34:19.512
[Struggling to breath]

34:20.768 --> 34:22.053
Any last words?

34:25.314 --> 34:26.269
Yeah--

34:27.316 --> 34:29.307
This precious
game of yours--

34:30.861 --> 34:32.317
It's over, asshole.

34:32.947 --> 34:33.902
Ugh!

34:39.954 --> 34:41.160
Bo--

34:41.872 --> 34:43.112
Bo!
Let him go!

34:44.333 --> 34:46.289
[Coughing]

34:46.543 --> 34:48.283
It's okay,
it's okay--

34:48.545 --> 34:49.295
You're okay--

34:49.546 --> 34:50.922
No!

34:51.173 --> 34:52.834
Let go of me!

35:00.557 --> 35:01.967
That's the best I can do--

35:02.226 --> 35:03.841
You need to see a doctor.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.343
I am a doctor.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.770
Seeing you all beat up
like this kinda breaks my heart.

35:11.360 --> 35:14.272
Bo, can we forget the first aid
for a minute, please?

35:16.115 --> 35:17.355
If you insist...

35:17.616 --> 35:19.197
No, Bo--
Bo--

35:23.414 --> 35:25.245
I'm not happy.

35:28.127 --> 35:29.367
What?

35:30.879 --> 35:31.914
But you...

35:33.340 --> 35:34.500
...you are.

35:35.217 --> 35:36.172
Yeah.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.007
Yeah...

35:41.348 --> 35:45.717
After The Dawning...
| feel new... Lauren.

35:47.271 --> 35:48.886
I wanna be happy.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.397
I wanna live,
I wanna travel the world.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.267
But I only want
to do that with you.

35:57.156 --> 35:59.112
I'm just,
I'm so tired, Bo.

36:01.452 --> 36:04.285
These last few years
with the Fae, |--

36:06.332 --> 36:09.699
...the Garuda and Nadia...

36:11.086 --> 36:13.372
| feel like
I'm losing myself.

36:15.924 --> 36:18.301
Well, I don't want
you to feel that way.

36:20.054 --> 36:21.635
I want you
to feel amazing.

36:21.889 --> 36:24.380
I want you to feel
the way that | feel

36:24.641 --> 36:26.142
whenever I'm with you.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.147
You just--

36:31.398 --> 36:32.604
Tell me what you need.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.270
Babe,PH
do anything.

36:37.905 --> 36:40.442
I think that
we need a break.

36:43.285 --> 36:44.900
From us?

36:46.914 --> 36:48.450
I am so sorry, Bo.

36:50.667 --> 36:53.079
But I think that I'm always
going to be asking from you

36:53.337 --> 36:55.202
more than you
can give to me.

36:57.091 --> 36:58.171
Okay...

37:02.096 --> 37:04.929
If that's what you
think you need, then--

37:08.352 --> 37:09.592
I understand.

37:12.314 --> 37:14.305
I'll give you space.

37:18.404 --> 37:19.610
Of course
you're tired,

37:19.863 --> 37:22.024
you've just been
through hell, that's all.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.118
Maybe.

37:26.495 --> 37:28.451
And it has been
all about me--

37:30.332 --> 37:33.074
We need to focus
on you to make you--

37:33.335 --> 37:34.370
--the priority.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.627
And if space is
what you want then--

37:43.262 --> 37:45.127
You, um--

37:46.515 --> 37:48.972
You take all the
time that you need.

37:51.562 --> 37:54.144
I'm not
going anywhere.

38:11.999 --> 38:13.864
This is just a break--

38:15.294 --> 38:16.659
Right?

38:57.586 --> 39:00.293
You know, we, uh,
we got the guy.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.001
What?

39:04.593 --> 39:06.709
Our sociopathic
Romeo, Nelson.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.926
He's going away
for a long time.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.004
Oh--

39:13.936 --> 39:15.301
You okay?

39:21.151 --> 39:22.357
Do you know that--

39:23.570 --> 39:25.526
I thought that
you were the enemy

39:25.781 --> 39:26.896
for a while there.

39:28.951 --> 39:31.533
That you were
gonna swoop in and...

39:31.787 --> 39:32.993
...take her away.

39:34.957 --> 39:36.117
Turns out I've
done a fine job

39:36.375 --> 39:38.331
of screwing it up
all by myself.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.711
Yeah, we're
gonna need shots.

39:49.179 --> 39:50.635
We're on a break.

39:52.975 --> 39:53.805
Well, uh...

39:54.059 --> 39:55.299
If you're looking
for a distraction,

39:55.561 --> 39:57.677
|'m partial to bar fights
and howling at the moon.

39:57.938 --> 39:59.144
[Laughing]

39:59.398 --> 40:01.684
Don't know if that's
your cup of tea, though.

40:07.948 --> 40:09.313
For what it's worth?

40:10.576 --> 40:12.532
She really does love you.

40:13.579 --> 40:14.944
I can tell.

40:21.378 --> 40:22.743
Well...

40:23.964 --> 40:25.374
Whatever happens--
it's not like

40:25.632 --> 40:28.465
she's irreplaceably
perfect, right?

40:28.719 --> 40:30.175
She's so stubborn.

40:31.430 --> 40:32.294
She can be bitchy.

40:32.556 --> 40:33.921
[Laughing]

40:35.517 --> 40:36.632
Impetuous.

40:40.355 --> 40:41.515
Brave.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.770
Noble-hearted.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.185
Best sex I'll ever have.

40:48.447 --> 40:49.106
[Laughing]

40:49.364 --> 40:50.979
Gods, yes.

40:55.996 --> 40:57.987
How could I ever
get over her?

41:00.876 --> 41:02.582
I'll let you know.

41:07.174 --> 41:08.710
Shots.

41:45.587 --> 41:46.747
[Knocking on door]

41:56.139 --> 41:59.472
Unless you're Kenzi or a pint
of tequila-spiked ice cream--

41:59.726 --> 42:01.512
please Fae off.

42:04.439 --> 42:07.101
That is a sad,
sad little box.

42:07.359 --> 42:08.724
Yeah, well--

42:08.985 --> 42:11.192
It's some stuff
that Lauren left here.

42:11.446 --> 42:13.562
Can't say we're not
having problems...

42:13.824 --> 42:14.939
but...

42:15.951 --> 42:18.112
...we will work through it.

42:18.370 --> 42:19.860
I will fix this.

42:20.789 --> 42:23.326
If that's what
you want, you bet.

42:24.960 --> 42:28.544
Think it'd be ok if I kept it
for just a little while longer?

42:29.715 --> 42:31.831
I think she'd
be good with that.

42:33.176 --> 42:34.256
Yeah...

42:36.763 --> 42:38.424
I'm so, so sorry.

42:39.558 --> 42:43.096
I didn't figure you Valkyries
for the sentimental type.

42:43.353 --> 42:44.684
Ow!

42:44.938 --> 42:45.802
Sorry...

42:46.064 --> 42:48.020
My hand just got
caught in your hair.

42:49.359 --> 42:51.566
Okay. Well...

42:51.820 --> 42:53.651
I'm about to get
ragingly drunk,

42:53.905 --> 42:54.985
would you like some wine?

42:55.240 --> 42:56.525
Yeah.

43:09.463 --> 43:11.374
Tamsin...?
