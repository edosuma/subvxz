something's bothering you

of that car

Do you think you could
loosen my cuffs?

No.

Don't you

I can kiss the chick vote

you're gonna break my fall!

Word to the wise, Quimby.
Don't write checks
your butt can't cash.

Hear me loud and clear Wiggum,

You talk the talk, Quimby,
but do you walk the walk?

I hereby declare today

What?!

But, Marge,
we just had a vacation.

No, Homey, no.

take separate vacations.

you're coming back.

yourself.

to leave the house

maybe she should
just stay with you.

that's wise?

Homer:
Never leave again!
Never leave again!

21:24.210 --> 21:25.150
Never leave again.

21:25.210 --> 21:27.410
I missed you too.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.020
Marge:
<i>And from now on,
I hope you'll help me out</i>

21:29.080 --> 21:30.210
<i>a little more than you used to.</i>

21:30.280 --> 21:31.650
You got it, sweetheart.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.320
You have enough blanket, there?

21:33.390 --> 21:35.630
Well, I could use a little more.

21:35.690 --> 21:38.730
And sometimes,
I want a little time to myself

21:38.790 --> 21:40.090
and I expect you to help...

21:40.160 --> 21:41.160
Bart:
Mom...

21:41.230 --> 21:42.470
I think I speak

21:42.530 --> 21:44.270
for everyone
in this bed

21:44.330 --> 21:46.740
when I say you have
<i>nothing to worry about.</i>

21:46.800 --> 21:48.070
Now, let's just
try and get

21:48.140 --> 21:49.640
a little shut-eye. Okay?

21:49.700 --> 21:51.770
