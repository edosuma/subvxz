WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:03.671
(high-pitched scream)

00:03.771 --> 00:05.506
Oh, Mitchell.
Are you awake?

00:05.606 --> 00:07.441
Yeah, I think the lady
upstairs just screamed.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.710
Should we check on her?
No, that was me.

00:09.810 --> 00:12.413
Something terrible
just happened in the shower.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.115
Oh, God.
What did you try to shave?

00:14.215 --> 00:16.884
No, I forgot the words to
"Thank God I'm A Country Boy."

00:16.984 --> 00:18.219
Okay, two minutes ago,
I was on the back

00:18.319 --> 00:20.121
of a snowmobile
with Daniel Craig.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.456
Mitchell, I sang that song
my entire childhood.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.292
If I can't remember
the lyrics,

00:24.392 --> 00:26.627
that means I've lost complete
touch with my roots.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.529
How could
I let this happen?

00:28.629 --> 00:30.198
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.965
I'm not.
This is mostly your doing.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.601
Should have
seen that coming.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.103
You have shamed
the country boy out of me.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.971
You roll your eyes when I say
"y'all" or "fixin'".

00:38.072 --> 00:39.573
You made me take down
our clothesline.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.575
I just asked that
we put it in the backyard.

00:41.675 --> 00:42.643
You know
what I have to do.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.078
Relearn the lyrics to --

00:44.178 --> 00:45.746
Get a chicken.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.048
So, apparently,
there's no legal reason

00:48.149 --> 00:49.883
why we can't have a chicken
in our backyard,

00:49.983 --> 00:52.420
and -- and I did
a real deep dive.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.990
Okay, so this is the kitchen,
which we recently remodeled.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.660
(clucking)
Get used to that.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.296
Okay, this is
the living room.

01:02.396 --> 01:08.236
**

01:08.336 --> 01:14.242
**

01:16.577 --> 01:20.148
Okay, so, you and Mom
will be in the chairs.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.916
Me, Haley, and Luke
will be on the couch.

01:23.016 --> 01:25.486
And the interviewer
will be right here.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.156
Alex is up for a very
prestigious government job

01:28.256 --> 01:30.624
that requires
a family interview.

01:30.724 --> 01:31.925
In case they bring
one of those memory zappers,

01:32.025 --> 01:34.628
I've Sharpied all the pertinent
information on my arm --

01:34.728 --> 01:36.029
PIN numbers, et cetera.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.365
Oh, honey, you don't think that
they're really going to --

01:37.465 --> 01:41.302
Oh, do not worry, little lady.
I got you covered.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.304
If you really want to
impress the interviewer,

01:43.404 --> 01:45.473
why don't you try
casually leaving out

01:45.573 --> 01:48.142
this completed
New York Times crossword

01:48.242 --> 01:49.977
that I found at the gym?

01:50.077 --> 01:52.313
Why bring a knife
to a gun fight?

01:52.413 --> 01:54.615
How about I lay out
the family heirloom?

01:54.715 --> 01:57.618
1931.
Great-grandpa Ted Dunphy

01:57.718 --> 02:00.621
is driving south from Modesto
one foggy evening.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.122
He picks up
a stranded motorist

02:02.223 --> 02:04.124
and drives him
to a gas station.

02:04.225 --> 02:07.461
The man has no money,
so Ted pays for his gas.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.796
The man thanks him
with a quick drawing

02:08.896 --> 02:10.130
on a cocktail napkin.

02:10.231 --> 02:13.401
For you see, that man...
was Walt Disney.

02:13.501 --> 02:17.738
And this familiar fellow
is Mickey Mouse.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.408
Yeah, no thanks on the heirloom
or the crossword, guys.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.410
Let's just keep it simple, okay?

02:22.510 --> 02:24.578
Honey, relax.
You're awesome.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.248
It's gonna go great.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.916
Just as soon as we get
this chair back

02:29.016 --> 02:32.186
to where it's been ever since
we've lived in this house.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.488
Mom, can you please stop
managing everything?

02:34.588 --> 02:35.989
You mean like when she cleaned
my hat collection

02:36.089 --> 02:37.491
out of the front closet
in case the interviewer

02:37.591 --> 02:38.692
looked in there?

02:38.792 --> 02:40.027
Honey, you never wore
those hats,

02:40.127 --> 02:41.995
and the charity
was glad to get them.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.664
Maybe you should have also
donated my dream of one day

02:43.764 --> 02:45.533
going to the Kentucky Derby
or Easter at a black church.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.702
Hey, Alex. Quick tip.
Smile during the interview.

02:48.802 --> 02:51.038
I've been learning a lot about
different personality types

02:51.138 --> 02:53.907
in my psych course, and you're
kind of textbook borderline --

02:54.007 --> 02:55.409
all brains, no empathy.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.745
You know, Luke,
we are so very proud

02:57.845 --> 02:59.079
of all the hard work
you're doing,

02:59.179 --> 03:01.249
and I look forward
to hearing your insights

03:01.349 --> 03:02.550
when you finish chapter two.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.119
But for now, maybe you could
just put that book away.
(chair scraping)

03:06.220 --> 03:07.755
No surprise
you'd say that.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.590
Controlling, obsessive --

03:09.690 --> 03:11.759
classic Commandant
personality type.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.394
Ooh, burn.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.095
Oh, grow up, Haley.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.230
Sadly, she can't.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.899
Such is the plight of
the Peter Pan personality.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.901
You're saying Haley
refuses to grow up?

03:21.001 --> 03:22.236
I don't believe that.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.738
Which brings us to another type,
the Dreamer --

03:24.838 --> 03:28.075
head in the clouds,
tends to be naive, gullible.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.278
I love that
you're smart now.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.247
That's your classic
game-day breakfast --

03:33.347 --> 03:34.415
your carbs, fiber,
your protein.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.083
You throw a shot of brandy
in there,

03:36.183 --> 03:37.618
you'll be ready to play
in the Ice Bowl.

03:37.718 --> 03:41.622
I don't eat beets.
Never have, never will.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.624
When you were 2, you ate
a dime and a butterfly.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.925
Now your body is a temple?

03:45.025 --> 03:46.760
He can eat a protein bar
in the car.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.997
We still have to pick up some
players that live far away.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.499
Gloria,
this is not okay.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.500
It's legal.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.502
They have P.O. boxes
in the district.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.070
And besides,
everybody bends the rules.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.407
I swear the goalie
from the other team

03:59.507 --> 04:01.074
has been my Uber driver.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.910
Gloria,
I'm trying to get the kid

04:03.010 --> 04:05.346
to eat his vegetables.
I could use a little support.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.480
Why aren't you dressed?

04:06.580 --> 04:09.317
You're supposed to referee
two games today.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.484
I told you I don't
want to do that!

04:10.584 --> 04:12.152
I got my boxing match
tonight.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.355
Besides, those ref outfits
are stupid.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.856
Walk it off.
You're fine.

04:15.956 --> 04:19.159
Move it, Joe.
You're not hearing that?

04:19.259 --> 04:23.531
So, Haley,
you tell us about Alex.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.199
Well, it was not easy
sharing a room with a genius.
(chuckles)

04:26.300 --> 04:28.869
She was always up reading
and calculating,

04:28.969 --> 04:30.804
but she also
inspired me.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.039
When I turned 21,
I said,

04:32.139 --> 04:34.875
"Haley, time to be
your own woman,"

04:34.975 --> 04:36.344
and I moved
into the basement.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.512
I'm sorry. I don't --
I don't mean to interrupt,

04:38.612 --> 04:40.681
but I just keep replaying

04:40.781 --> 04:43.451
my answer to you
about my parenting style.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.118
Oh, don't give it
a second thought.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.120
But when I said
I wanted to run away

04:47.220 --> 04:48.656
and never come back,
that was a joke.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.223
Yeah, absolutely.
I know.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.792
It's just that you
wrote it down --

04:51.892 --> 04:53.627
Mom, let it go.
Okay.

04:53.727 --> 04:57.130
So, Alex, I see you spent
your summer in Honduras.

04:57.230 --> 05:00.401
Any other travel
that inspired...

05:00.501 --> 05:01.669
Mrs. Dunphy?

05:01.769 --> 05:04.505
If you could maybe just make
a little, like, L-O-L

05:04.605 --> 05:07.074
next to my joke,
so then it's super clear.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.909
Australia, a camping trip
to Costa Rica,

05:09.009 --> 05:11.078
and a month in Europe.
Excellent.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.747
Well, she does come by
her wanderlust honestly.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.749
The kids here all know
about my high school trip

05:15.849 --> 05:18.018
to the Soviet Union.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.687
Yeah, but she doesn't
need to hear about that.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.222
No, please. Continue.
In the depths of the Cold War,

05:22.322 --> 05:24.525
my tumbling team was part
of a cultural exchange.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.727
I became friends with
a Russian tumbler named Sergei

05:26.827 --> 05:29.062
who wanted to hear
all about the U.S.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.331
He asked me to -- to send
pictures when I got home,

05:31.432 --> 05:32.933
and not just touristy stuff.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.768
Sergei was interested
in ordinary things --

05:34.868 --> 05:38.105
uh, airports, um, power plants,
train stations.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.073
His family was in
the fence business.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.076
He said our military had
the best fencing...

05:43.176 --> 05:44.578
(chuckling)
...in the world.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.247
I must have sent him
50 pictures

05:47.347 --> 05:49.049
of the perimeter
of Camp Pendleton.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.853
Anyway, we don't want to
take up your whole day.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.688
You wouldn't have time
to write up your report,

05:54.788 --> 05:56.690
Which you could title
Alex Dunphy:

05:56.790 --> 05:59.693
The Apple that fell
very far from the Tree.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.729
Thank you all very much.
I will be in touch.

06:01.829 --> 06:02.730
-Thank you.
-Okay, bye-bye.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.098
-Fun chatting.
-You know what?

06:05.198 --> 06:07.901
We Dunphys clean up pretty well
when we want to, don't we?

06:08.001 --> 06:09.537
Are you kidding me?

06:09.637 --> 06:13.206
Mom, did you really have to
OCD all over her notebook?

06:13.306 --> 06:15.042
And you, bragging about

06:15.142 --> 06:17.210
still living at home at,
like, what? 30?

06:17.310 --> 06:19.813
And Dad, well done.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.615
There's nothing
that cinches a government job

06:21.715 --> 06:23.717
like finding out your dad
was a Russian spy!

06:23.817 --> 06:25.385
Luke was right
about all of you.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.888
Commandant, Peter Pan,
Dreamer.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.890
Thank you, Alexandra.
It's not easy

06:29.990 --> 06:31.492
being the smart ones
in this family.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.326
Don't compare us!

06:33.427 --> 06:34.995
Your last English paper
came back

06:35.095 --> 06:37.965
with a Garfield sticker on it
that said "Way to go!"

06:38.065 --> 06:40.468
That's the second highest
sticker she gives out!

06:40.568 --> 06:42.770
(footsteps departing)

06:46.674 --> 06:49.510
Another fresh one,
courtesy of Princess Layer.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.678
Another new name?
(door closes)

06:50.778 --> 06:53.113
She's already been Egg Ryan
and Chicky Minaj.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.115
I know having a chicken
isn't your dream.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.117
But if it makes you
feel any better,

06:57.217 --> 06:59.019
I think I know
who I am again.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.855
A person who hates chickens!

07:01.955 --> 07:05.493
They are filthy
and beyond stupid.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.660
The moment
I can find the receipt,

07:06.760 --> 07:07.995
I am returning that chicken.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.162
But I'm not gonna
let Mitchell know because,

07:09.262 --> 07:12.132
like that vile bird,
I made a big stink.

07:12.232 --> 07:15.268
Oh. We're out of
chicken feed again?

07:15.368 --> 07:17.270
I have a meeting
at the school today

07:17.370 --> 07:18.271
with the homecoming
committee.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.973
If polling is correct,
the new queen

07:20.073 --> 07:21.108
is gonna be
in a wheelchair,

07:21.208 --> 07:22.610
and we already
blew our ramp budget

07:22.710 --> 07:25.312
on a balloon drop,
so could you maybe --

07:25.412 --> 07:26.647
Cam, this will be
my third trip

07:26.747 --> 07:28.148
to the feed and grain store
this week.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.150
We agreed that
you'd be the one

07:30.250 --> 07:33.220
to take care of
this awful thing.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.056
I've never really felt
a connection to animals,

07:36.156 --> 07:38.659
but there's just something
about that chicken.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.328
The soulful eyes,
the nervous movements,

07:41.428 --> 07:44.164
the cute little splash
of red on top.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.733
She's just likeable.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.901
Plus, I love going
to that feed store.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.804
T-The second I walk through
the door, I'm one of them.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.575
Howdy, Bobby.
Hey.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.576
Smells like rain.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.077
What are you doing back
so soon?

07:57.177 --> 07:58.178
Yeah, I told you
you got to buy

07:58.278 --> 08:00.080
more than one bag
of feed at a time.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.181
No, it's no bother.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.517
No, it's nice to
get out of the field,

08:03.617 --> 08:05.853
away from the chicken...s.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.020
(birds chirping)

08:07.120 --> 08:08.221
Evenin'.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.424
The problem is
I can't let Cam know

08:11.525 --> 08:14.261
that I'm enjoying my new life
as a gentleman farmer.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.263
I-I've spent
our whole relationship

08:16.363 --> 08:18.932
trying to tamp down
his farm-ness.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.601
Ugh, it's all the encouragement
he'd need

08:20.701 --> 08:24.104
to -- to move us to Missouri
and go full Old MacDonald.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.373
E-I-E-I-no.
(clicks tongue)

08:28.175 --> 08:31.244
Did I leave that unlatched?
Oh, God.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.715
Hennifer? Hennifer?!

08:34.815 --> 08:38.385
Hey, are you Ridley?
I'm reffing the 1:00 game.

08:38.485 --> 08:41.421
Hey, do I get my voucher
for a hot dog before or after?

08:41.521 --> 08:43.791
Oh...Hey.
You got your whistle?

08:43.891 --> 08:45.292
Oh, damn.
I forgot it.

08:45.392 --> 08:48.428
Late and no whistle? Where's
your respect for the game?

08:48.528 --> 08:49.763
On a football field
somewhere.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.965
Hey, what do you say
I borrow yours?
Are you kidding?

08:52.065 --> 08:53.466
I just lost six weeks
of school to mono.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.602
You're on field 4.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.606
All right.
Let's get this over with.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.440
You are the referee
for my game?

09:00.540 --> 09:01.942
You don't know anything
about soccer.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.277
Take that up with the lady
who forced me into this.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.279
(sighs)
Okay, purple, let's go!

09:06.379 --> 09:08.081
Joe, Finn,
Clyde up front!

09:08.181 --> 09:09.917
Lucas, Dylan,
Chad in the back!

09:10.017 --> 09:11.919
Estefan, in goal!

09:12.019 --> 09:13.754
I'm guessing that Estefan
is the kid

09:13.854 --> 09:15.155
who lives
out of the district?

09:15.255 --> 09:17.257
His legs are hairier
than mine,

09:17.357 --> 09:19.326
and I think he was wearing
a wedding ring.

09:19.426 --> 09:22.930
Let's get this party started,
rookie.

09:23.964 --> 09:28.268
Okay, they won't start
unless you use the whistle.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.238
Whistle! Whistle!

09:31.338 --> 09:34.441
Clyde, it's open!
Yes!

09:34.541 --> 09:37.678
Whistle! No goal!
Purple offside!

09:37.778 --> 09:40.247
Offside?
Are you blind?
RIDLEY: He's right.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.515
Free kick for red
right where the ball is.

09:42.616 --> 09:45.185
Yes, free kick for red
right where the ball is.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.154
And...whistle.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.158
For the first time in weeks,
Gloria had to listen to me.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.961
I was in charge.
Ridley said so.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.296
Goal, yes!

09:56.396 --> 09:58.298
Coach, you're running up
the score.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.967
You got to sub in
some of your weaker players.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.202
How about this kid with the neck
pillow? It's usually a tip-off.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.537
I'm not running up the score.
I'm winning.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.507
You either make the substitution
or you are leaving my field.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.342
Pbht.
That's it! Whistle!

10:09.442 --> 10:10.343
You're out of here!

10:10.443 --> 10:12.680
(shouting in Spanish)

10:12.780 --> 10:13.714
Doesn't frighten me.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.850
(air hisses)

10:16.950 --> 10:18.351
How about that?

10:18.451 --> 10:19.486
A little bit.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.021
(ringing)

10:21.121 --> 10:22.155
(click)

10:22.255 --> 10:23.657
DYLAN: Oh, hey, Haley.
What's up?

10:23.757 --> 10:25.492
I'm kind of mad
at my family, actually.

10:25.592 --> 10:28.161
They keep saying I have one of
those Peter Pan personalities,

10:28.261 --> 10:29.663
so, um, change of plans.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.064
We're going to a play,
not the circus.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.132
Wait, what?

10:32.232 --> 10:33.400
Dylan, don't make
a thing out of this.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.567
The elephant's
not going to remember

10:34.668 --> 10:36.136
you promised
to see him next year.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.639
No, Haley. I-I can't hear you.
Bad reception.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.808
Let me move up.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.079
PHIL: Was Alex right?

10:46.179 --> 10:49.582
Had I been an unwitting --
an unwitting spy?

10:49.683 --> 10:52.352
I even dug out an old article
they'd done on me

10:52.452 --> 10:54.187
in a Russian newspaper
during my trip.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.023
Sergei told me
the headline said,

10:56.123 --> 10:58.391
"Young Tumbler's
Mission of Friendship."
(click, beep)

10:58.491 --> 10:59.727
A quick scan
into Google Translate

10:59.827 --> 11:01.161
revealed the truth --

11:01.261 --> 11:05.032
"Famous Tumbler
Denounces the West."

11:05.132 --> 11:06.700
I needed some fresh air
to clear my head.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.368
Had I been that big a dupe
in high school?

11:08.468 --> 11:09.536
And if so,
what was stopping them

11:09.636 --> 11:11.338
from trying to
use me again today?

11:19.679 --> 11:21.849
Hey, Mr. D!

11:21.949 --> 11:25.385
Hey, hey, hey!
What's up, buddy?!

11:31.792 --> 11:34.094
Makes you crazy,
doesn't it, Commandant?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.295
No.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.965
So you weren't about to
straighten that chair?

11:38.065 --> 11:40.467
Because if the whole world
isn't completely ordered,

11:40.567 --> 11:42.402
it feels like your skin
is on fire?

11:42.502 --> 11:44.905
This is literally
armchair psychology.

11:45.005 --> 11:48.308
Luke, your label for me
was spot on. I am a Dreamer.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.143
No, worse, I'm a --
I'm a patsy,

11:50.243 --> 11:52.245
a mark,
a full-on sucker!

11:52.345 --> 11:53.981
Phil, calm down.
You're not a dupe.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.715
Have a seat.

11:55.816 --> 11:56.716
Sad.
Hmm.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.318
Hey, guys.
Hey, Dylan.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.754
Sweet lid.
What did it cost you?
Zilch.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.123
Someone threw a bunch of them
in the trash across the street.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.125
So, uh, Haley's
waiting for you downstairs.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.060
Off you go.
Hang on. I used to have a Panama
that looked a little like --

12:07.160 --> 12:08.328
And my fedora!

12:08.428 --> 12:10.831
You duped me into believing
we were donating them to ISSBA,

12:10.931 --> 12:12.833
and you were just gonna
throw them in the trash.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.667
But this doesn't just hurt me,
Claire.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.236
What about the poor people
at the Institute

12:16.336 --> 12:19.339
for Sun-Sensitive Bald...
Americans?

12:19.439 --> 12:20.841
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Phil.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.675
It's just that woman was
coming and the interview --

12:22.776 --> 12:24.344
and there was
all that clutter.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.847
I'm sick.
Tell him, Luke.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.849
Save it, Claire. You think of me
what everyone thinks of me.

12:28.949 --> 12:32.119
I'm a rube, a pigeon,
a greenhorn.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.187
Okay, Dylan. Let's get you
changed and lose the hat.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.522
It's rude to block
people's views

12:35.622 --> 12:37.157
where we'll be spending
our afternoon...

12:37.257 --> 12:39.492
at an adult theater.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.328
Huh.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.996
I mean, we all knew

12:43.096 --> 12:44.331
there was gonna be
a third one, right?

12:44.431 --> 12:45.532
I didn't!
Okay.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.203
I must have left the latch open.
You probably did.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.206
I -- I know how much
that chicken means to you.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.541
So much.

12:54.641 --> 12:55.876
And now something
this painful --

12:55.976 --> 12:59.446
I-I don't think I could
have a chicken again ever.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.514
Wait, wait.
T-The security camera.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.683
We can -- We can find out
exactly what happened.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.518
Oh, yeah.
I...forgot about that.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.354
Mitchell, Mitchell,
wait, wait.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.989
You're not used to the harsh
realities of farm life.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.691
All these animals --
they seem so sweet,

13:11.791 --> 13:14.227
but it's a bloodbath at
the first sign of weakness,

13:14.327 --> 13:15.362
like dinner
with our friends

13:15.462 --> 13:17.397
when one person gets up
from the table.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.667
Oh, my God. Okay,
well, you -- you look
and tell me what happened.
Okay.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.470
And later, tell me what people
say when I leave the table.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.706
Okay, well,
nothing happening yet.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.707
Okay, you know,
I want to see.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.177
No. No, no, no. Don't.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.845
(gasps) Oh, no.
Oh, no.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.847
Something's come
into the backyard.
What?

13:33.947 --> 13:35.215
I think it's a raccoon.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.151
Oh! Oh, the --
Oh, the horror!

13:38.251 --> 13:39.386
Oh, my God!

13:39.486 --> 13:40.921
No, no.
No, she's fighting.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.589
She's fighting, Mitchell,
with every fiber...

13:42.689 --> 13:44.691
That's right.
...of her indomitable
chicken-y spirit.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.994
And it's over.
Oh, gosh.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.495
Well, that's the worst
farm calamity I've seen

13:48.595 --> 13:50.530
since a dinner theater
production of Oklahoma!

13:50.630 --> 13:52.532
starring
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.234
Delete. Hmm.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.502
Where's the body?

13:55.602 --> 13:57.570
Um, dragged off.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.906
Well, then she could
still be alive!

13:59.006 --> 14:00.073
W-We have to look
for her.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.342
Okay. G-Grab her favorite
squeak toy.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.410
Okay, well, which --
which one?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.445
Squirrely Temple
or Lionardo DiCaprio?

14:05.545 --> 14:06.579
It's like you don't
even know her.

14:08.548 --> 14:12.719
"Dead-end alcoholics...broken
lives, and broken dreams..."

14:12.819 --> 14:14.721
Nope,
nothing about Spider-Man.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.723
Must be a different Iceman
that cometh.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.926
That's okay.
It could still be good.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.961
But, Dylan,
you have to stop looking

14:21.061 --> 14:22.862
at the carnival
over there.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.465
I'm sorry, but it just
might be easier to enjoy

14:25.565 --> 14:28.468
this unsparing look
at life's castoffs

14:28.568 --> 14:31.638
if I knew that afterwards,
we were gonna walketh over there

14:31.738 --> 14:33.473
and goeth
to the bumper cars.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.642
I'm literally asking
for only...

14:35.742 --> 14:37.210
4 1/2 hours?

14:37.310 --> 14:40.047
Look. I know you want to prove
that we're mature adults,

14:40.147 --> 14:41.548
but look at this line.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.650
We are
the young people here.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.884
Whereas...

14:44.985 --> 14:46.719
At the carnival,
we'd be, like,

14:46.819 --> 14:48.888
the oldest people there?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.723
May I remind you what
they said to us last time

14:50.823 --> 14:52.559
when they escorted us
out of the ball pit?

14:52.659 --> 14:55.963
"Excuse me, but this attraction
really isn't for..."

14:56.063 --> 14:57.630
"Adults."
Aha.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.134
M'lady.
M'Dylan.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.502
(footsteps approach)

15:02.602 --> 15:04.004
Okay,
we need to talk.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.605
You bet
we need to talk.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.407
I was out of bounds throwing
you out of that game.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.343
You bet you were out of bounds
throwing me out of that game.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.179
But it was all my fault,
Jay.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.947
You bet it was
all my fault, Jay --

15:14.047 --> 15:15.782
Don't Bugs Bunny me.
(foot stomps)

15:15.882 --> 15:18.451
Okay. So we both
like to be in charge.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.421
But when it comes to Joe,
can we both be on the same page?

15:21.521 --> 15:23.123
Like this morning when
I was trying to get him
to eat his vegetables?

15:23.223 --> 15:25.492
Back me up.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.660
I knew I should have
thrown away those beets!

15:27.760 --> 15:29.362
Stupid. What am I, 4?

15:29.462 --> 15:32.865
I guess we're not setting
a very good example.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.667
Exactly! When we say no
to each other,

15:34.767 --> 15:36.803
he thinks he can say
no to us.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.638
Yeah, like for his homework,
his bedtime --

15:38.738 --> 15:40.640
Or something important
like eating those nutritious...

15:40.740 --> 15:42.475
(lid creaks)

15:42.575 --> 15:44.111
Whistle!
Whistle!

15:44.211 --> 15:46.313
(sighs)
Phil, look.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.948
I'm really sorry
I lied to you about the hats.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.850
But in all fairness,
you do have a tendency to --

15:50.950 --> 15:53.020
This again? How I can't
throw anything away?

15:53.120 --> 15:56.689
We have 100 episodes
of Hoarders on DVR

15:56.789 --> 15:58.358
in case you
want to watch them again.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.526
That's not what
this is about.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.028
This is about me
blindly believing

16:01.128 --> 16:02.895
whatever
anybody tells me.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.864
You're being too hard
on yourself.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.666
You want to see
the best in people.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.735
It doesn't mean you're gonna
believe just anything.

16:08.835 --> 16:11.238
Really? What about our beloved
family heirloom?

16:11.338 --> 16:12.639
Claire?
Hmm?

16:12.739 --> 16:15.742
Is this real, or am I just a
fourth-generation Dunphy dummy?

16:15.842 --> 16:20.413
Well, uh, Mickey's shoulders
are a bit muscular.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.083
But, perhaps,
Walt customized it

16:23.183 --> 16:25.418
for your great-grandfather
because he was, uh --

16:25.518 --> 16:26.719
He was a longshoreman?

16:26.819 --> 16:27.987
He sold ladies' bonnets.
Oh.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.522
Mom, can you slip
Dad's credit card

16:29.622 --> 16:30.890
back in his wallet
before he --

16:30.990 --> 16:33.326
Oh. Hey, handsome.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.561
Further proof of how
you all see me --

16:34.661 --> 16:36.329
as a turnip truck
faller-offer!

16:36.429 --> 16:38.665
No.
Then I'll ask you.

16:38.765 --> 16:42.569
Do you believe that this
was drawn by Walt Disney?

16:42.669 --> 16:43.670
Uh...

16:43.770 --> 16:45.405
Alex, get in here.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.040
Alex!
No, honey, you know what
she's gonna say.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.741
Her optometrist won't even
let her wear contacts

16:48.841 --> 16:51.911
'cause of all the excessive
eye rolling -- Hi.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.780
I need to know the truth.
(sighs)

16:53.880 --> 16:56.749
Alex,
real or unreal?

16:57.850 --> 16:58.785
Real.

16:58.885 --> 17:01.288
Yeah, it's a little off,
but didn't you say

17:01.388 --> 17:03.290
he had to draw it
in the back of a truck?

17:03.390 --> 17:04.957
And what hitchhiker

17:05.058 --> 17:06.793
would be carrying around
a drafting pencil

17:06.893 --> 17:08.428
if he wasn't some sort
of an animator?

17:08.528 --> 17:12.932
And who would run out of gas
on the side of the road

17:13.032 --> 17:14.434
but a starry-eyed dreamer
envisioning

17:14.534 --> 17:15.868
the happiest place
on earth?

17:15.968 --> 17:18.538
So...real.

17:18.638 --> 17:19.906
Also I got the job.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.441
What?
Hey.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.543
Yeah, they just called.
I'm still in shock myself.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.245
Oh, honey.
I'm so proud of you.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.814
Oh, let me get some champagne.
Luke, help me with the glasses.

17:27.914 --> 17:31.118
Alex, that's amazing.
I knew you could do it.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.419
You say that
about everything.

17:32.519 --> 17:35.122
Well, I know, but --
No, thank you.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.991
Riding a bike,
my first cello concert,

17:39.092 --> 17:41.828
freshman chemistry,
this job --

17:41.928 --> 17:44.664
every time I was sure
I couldn't do something,

17:44.764 --> 17:45.965
you convinced me I could.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.636
It's nice to have
a believer in the house.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.744
(toy squeaking)

17:57.844 --> 17:59.579
I don't see her anywhere.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.748
All right, let's maybe turn
around and look over there?

18:01.848 --> 18:03.783
Okay, Mitchell, why would
the chicken cross the road?

18:03.883 --> 18:06.286
We were never finding
that chicken.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.621
After an unpleasant struggle
that I only won

18:08.721 --> 18:11.090
after sustaining
multiple scratches,

18:11.191 --> 18:12.592
I put it in the back seat
of my car,

18:12.692 --> 18:15.928
drove it to the egg farm,
and lobbed it over the fence.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.864
They can fly a little.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.200
Oh, your arm's all scratched up.
What happened?

18:20.300 --> 18:22.034
Oh, um, it's probably
from when I was trying to

18:22.135 --> 18:24.537
break that fight up with those,
um -- those blue jays.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.206
Oh.
Oh, gosh. Oh, God.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.374
(yawning)
Oh, man.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.809
I am all of a sudden
feeling very tired.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.511
Well, do you want me to drive?
No, no, it's fine.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.847
Cam, watch out!
Oh, my God!
(tires screech)

18:34.947 --> 18:36.683
(exhales deeply)

18:36.783 --> 18:38.285
You got rid
of Hennifer.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.020
(sighs)
Okay, I admit it.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.955
I hated that chicken,
and I was too ashamed

18:43.055 --> 18:45.292
to say anything because I --
I made such a big stink

18:45.392 --> 18:47.126
out of you shaming
the country out of me.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.161
I'm sorry.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.562
I have a confession.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.798
I love that chicken.
Really?

18:51.898 --> 18:54.066
I-I didn't want to admit it
because I like to see myself

18:54.167 --> 18:56.569
as a sort of, you know,
sophisticated urbanite.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.238
(chuckles)
But I guess you --

18:58.338 --> 18:59.706
you countrified me
a little.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.908
Well, you citified me.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.910
Aww, that's kind of sweet.
It is.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.412
You know, now we just
need to find an activity

19:05.512 --> 19:08.581
that satisfies the straw-chewing
country boy in you

19:08.681 --> 19:11.851
and the window-shopping
cosmopolitan in me.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.088
Drive up the road a piece.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.825
Now, will this horse shampoo
harm a cat?

19:18.925 --> 19:20.327
Because I just --
I love the scent.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.328
(sniffs)

19:21.428 --> 19:22.662
Collar up or down?

19:22.762 --> 19:23.896
Uh, down.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.765
Mm-hmm.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.501
(laughs)

19:28.601 --> 19:30.270
You'll pay for that!

19:31.838 --> 19:33.105
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.708
Timeout, timeout!
I just saw my reflection!

19:35.808 --> 19:38.411
I told you that churro was
going to drink up my lipstick.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.413
Time in!

19:40.513 --> 19:44.851
Oh, my God! Dylan, the lipstick
went up my nose!

19:44.951 --> 19:46.219
It's really
jammed up there!

19:46.319 --> 19:48.087
Oh, okay.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.356
Stay still, Haley.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.291
I'll -- I'll hit you
from the other side.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.728
What are you doing?

19:58.064 --> 20:00.900
Just want to let you know,
the x-ray shows no broken nose.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.202
I guess you figured out
we were acting kind of childish.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.771
Enjoy it while you can,
right?

20:04.871 --> 20:07.774
Yeah. Who says we have to
race into being adults?

20:07.874 --> 20:09.442
Why wouldn't you want to
enjoy a carefree life

20:09.542 --> 20:10.743
as long as you could?

20:10.843 --> 20:12.111
At least
until the baby comes.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.447
Oh, that's years away.
Trust me. (chuckles)

20:14.547 --> 20:17.417
Actually, we always run
a blood test before anesthesia.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.718
You're pregnant.

20:25.292 --> 20:28.895
We can be here
all night.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.162
JAY: I couldn't.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.399
I was late to watch
the fight at Shorty's.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.734
By the time I got there,
the Polish sausage

20:34.834 --> 20:37.604
was gonna be down to
those puckered end pieces.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.673
(cellphone vibrating)

20:42.475 --> 20:44.277
Listen,
I'll meet you halfway.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.612
When your mother's
not looking,

20:45.712 --> 20:47.079
you eat a beet,
I eat a beet.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.114
Deal?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.117
(sighs)

20:51.217 --> 20:53.019
Mi amor,
can I get some wine?

20:54.654 --> 20:56.356
That was
Estefan's father.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.525
The Green Goblins
are trying to recruit him.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.861
I need to stop by the ATM
and then go to his house.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.864
When your daddy's not looking,
let's split the beets, okay?

21:09.669 --> 21:12.204
Fine.
I'm ready to eat these,

21:12.305 --> 21:13.606
but can we
turn off the lights

21:13.706 --> 21:15.775
so I don't have to see
how gross they are?

21:15.875 --> 21:17.276
Makes sense.
Good idea.

21:17.377 --> 21:20.447
(silverware clatters)

21:20.547 --> 21:23.282
Bravo, papi!
That's my guy!

21:29.522 --> 21:32.058
