WEBVTT

00:01.230 --> 00:02.595
Previously on SEAL Team...
Okay, what am I

00:02.630 --> 00:04.461
supposed to do with
this thing again?

00:04.500 --> 00:06.536
Emma agrees not to get
into a car driven by someone

00:06.570 --> 00:09.061
who's been drinking,
and we agree not to punish her

00:09.110 --> 00:12.102
if she calls us, drunk,
to ask for a ride.

00:18.450 --> 00:21.146
JASON: Ray,
you all right?

00:21.180 --> 00:22.545
RAY:
If you're having trouble

00:22.590 --> 00:24.785
staying on top of things...
I'm not having trouble, Ray.

00:24.820 --> 00:26.253
I've been handling
the finances in this family

00:26.290 --> 00:26.858
for ten years.

00:26.890 --> 00:27.754
NAIMA:
It's not good.

00:27.790 --> 00:29.257
Really not good.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.757
You ever hear from Danny?

00:30.790 --> 00:32.223
You guys were pretty
tight back then.

00:32.260 --> 00:33.454
No, yeah, we were
for a while.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.525
Till he went
and tried to kiss me.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.096
Ooh. Sly dog.

01:18.470 --> 01:21.439
Bravo, Lima, Quebec, Mike Mike,
Papa, Sierra.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.345
Holding for Teacher.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.510
Still holding for Teacher.

02:32.580 --> 02:34.571
*

02:45.690 --> 02:47.555
Congrats again.
You'll love the house.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.761
Thank you.
Bye.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.462
Now, they looked happy.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.389
Well, I got them a $50,000
credit on their new house,

02:55.440 --> 02:56.668
so I would hope they're happy.

02:56.710 --> 02:57.802
There you go, right?

02:57.840 --> 02:59.808
Always be closing, right?

02:59.840 --> 03:01.398
Yeah, something like that.
Okay.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.668
Uh-huh, so...

03:03.950 --> 03:05.406
You called me over here,
left a message,

03:05.450 --> 03:06.849
said you needed to talk to me.

03:06.880 --> 03:10.247
Emma got invited to the
Narrows this weekend.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.643
Lily's parents
have a house there.

03:11.690 --> 03:14.386
Okay. Seems nice.

03:14.420 --> 03:15.387
Or not.

03:15.420 --> 03:16.523
I don't trust Lily.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.255
She's wild.
Well, what...

03:18.290 --> 03:19.450
What kind of trouble
could they get into?

03:19.500 --> 03:20.956
They don't even drive.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.820
I'm worried they're planning
to meet up with some boys.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.996
Ooh.

03:24.030 --> 03:25.395
Boys. Okay.

03:25.430 --> 03:26.567
Anyone in particular?

03:26.600 --> 03:28.591
Julian. He's a freshman.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.664
That doesn't
sound too...

03:29.710 --> 03:30.859
At Hudson State.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.674
Hudson State College?

03:33.710 --> 03:34.802
Jason, you're not
gonna say anything?

03:34.840 --> 03:35.829
What do you want me to say?

03:35.880 --> 03:36.949
Emma can take care of herself.

03:36.980 --> 03:37.947
Daddy's little girl?

03:37.980 --> 03:39.948
Come on. What do you want to do?

03:39.980 --> 03:41.743
You want to ground her
because she's got a boyfriend?

03:41.780 --> 03:44.283
I told her she can't go.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.857
Before I came over
to talk this through...

03:46.890 --> 03:48.448
I didn't call you here
to talk it through.

03:48.490 --> 03:49.787
I just need you to back me up.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.457
Back you up how?
Call her.

03:51.490 --> 03:52.991
Tell her, tell her
we talked it over,

03:53.030 --> 03:54.691
and you agree with me,
she shouldn't go.

03:54.730 --> 03:55.890
Maybe I don't agree with you.

03:55.930 --> 03:59.491
You leave me alone with the kids
300 days out of the year.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.428
Least you could do is,
once in a while,

04:01.470 --> 04:03.404
not make me be the bad guy?

04:03.440 --> 04:05.260
You're not the bad guy here.
Sorry, did I
say "bad guy"?

04:05.310 --> 04:07.232
I meant "grown-up."

04:08.780 --> 04:09.804
I'll call her.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.805
Jason...
No, it's okay.

04:10.850 --> 04:11.646
I'll give her call,

04:11.680 --> 04:14.444
and I will tell her
that we talked.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.038
And that we're
on the same page.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.342
Right?

04:22.660 --> 04:23.922
DAVIS:
You excited to see Danny?

04:23.960 --> 04:26.497
Yeah. Just, you know.

04:26.530 --> 04:30.364
They finally got back to me out
of the blue, and he's in town.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.334
Just wonder what he looks like.

04:32.370 --> 04:34.031
Well, I mean, look,
it's been, what, six years?

04:34.070 --> 04:35.662
I'm sure we all look
a little different.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.338
No, it's just,
you know.

04:37.370 --> 04:40.009
What he looks like after
the frag hit him in the face.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.803
Yeah. I mean, look,
from what I remember,

04:41.840 --> 04:43.740
visiting him in the hospital,
most of that damage

04:43.780 --> 04:45.645
was below the waist.

04:45.680 --> 04:48.012
I was right next to
Danny when the bomber

04:48.050 --> 04:49.688
clacked his vest off.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.757
Most of the blast...
went straight out,

04:52.790 --> 04:56.886
and blew his lower body
into Danny's leg, and...

04:56.930 --> 04:58.989
I heard that's why his wounds
got all septic.

04:59.030 --> 05:00.827
Who's hungry?

05:00.860 --> 05:02.088
DANNY:
Hey.

05:02.130 --> 05:03.927
There he is.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.633
* And you get so scared,
yeah... *

05:12.440 --> 05:13.702
* Hold on...

05:16.710 --> 05:18.075
It's good to see you, man.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.418
I like this.
Yeah.

05:19.450 --> 05:20.542
I can grow one now.

05:21.980 --> 05:22.947
SONNY:
Looking good.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.082
Yeoman Third Class Davis.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.382
Good to see you again.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.580
That's actually Petty Officer

05:26.620 --> 05:27.814
First Class Davis.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.657
SONNY: Easy now.
I promised her

05:29.690 --> 05:30.827
you wouldn't try
and make out with her.

05:30.860 --> 05:31.929
Oh, you know me.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.552
I would never.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.750
Sit down.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.893
So...

05:37.930 --> 05:39.431
Good to hear from you.

05:39.470 --> 05:40.698
Yeah.
Yeah.

05:40.740 --> 05:41.968
What have you been up to?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.036
Private security.
Seems like it's, uh...

05:44.070 --> 05:46.573
paying well.

05:46.610 --> 05:47.838
If you're good.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.643
Now, how the hell
you making out?

05:51.680 --> 05:53.648
Seriously, you want a job?

05:53.680 --> 05:54.942
Come on. He's got, what, two
years left on this enlistment?

05:54.980 --> 05:56.641
Look it,
I am morally opposed

05:56.690 --> 05:57.941
to working for anybody

05:57.990 --> 05:59.787
that would allow me
to wear a jacket like that.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.823
Well, I hope you're not
morally opposed

06:03.860 --> 06:06.499
to them paying for lunch.
Well, as long as

06:06.530 --> 06:07.952
you're buying me
another whiskey, then.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.127
Looks good, man.

06:11.470 --> 06:12.698
Yeah, suits you.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.695
Makes your eyes pop.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.097
You should see the other guy.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.108
I did.

06:18.140 --> 06:20.506
Yeah. Well,
what was left of him, anyway.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.599
DANNY: You know, I still got
pieces of shrapnel inside me.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.845
Every once in a while, one of
them finds a way to the surface,

06:24.880 --> 06:26.848
and I have to scratch it out
through my skin.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.711
SONNY: That
right there

06:28.750 --> 06:31.480
is making me crave
some corned beef.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.657
Who's hungry?

06:34.020 --> 06:35.954
That was actually my joke,
just so you know.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.160
All right, I'll be right back.
Okay.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.963
Yep. You feel that right there?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.592
There's the pop.
Right in there.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.834
You got to wear the brace.

06:49.870 --> 06:51.963
JASON: Yeah, yeah,
the brace. I get it.

06:52.010 --> 06:53.671
Raymond. Give me a second.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.029
I'll be right with you.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.502
Ah, that's okay. I'll wait

06:56.550 --> 06:57.847
till you're done
with the old guy.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.575
The old man here
just bench-pressed 318 today.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.440
That's right.
Brother,

07:01.480 --> 07:02.788
how many times I got
to tell you that benching

07:02.820 --> 07:03.980
went out in the '905?

07:04.020 --> 07:05.578
It's all full body stuff now.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.178
Deadlifts, power cleans.
Okay.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.188
Would you please school
this meathead, Lucas?
Hey.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.881
This is between y'all.
It's between us?

07:10.930 --> 07:12.818
All right. Now let's get
a look at that shoulder.

07:12.860 --> 07:14.088
Your shoulder thing
acting up again?

07:15.200 --> 07:16.519
I just tweaked it a little bit,

07:16.570 --> 07:17.798
taking down that
big guy in Yemen.

07:17.830 --> 07:19.058
Is that right?
Yeah, Lucas will work his magic.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.863
It'll be good.
What kind of magic

07:20.900 --> 07:22.606
are you working there, Lucas?
'Cause I got to make sure

07:22.640 --> 07:25.108
that my number two
is operating on full strength.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.801
RAY: Look, I'm fine,
I just...

07:26.840 --> 07:27.977
That doesn't sound fine to me.

07:28.010 --> 07:29.170
It'll be fine.

07:29.210 --> 07:30.768
All right? I probably just
pulled something-- this is...

07:30.810 --> 07:32.107
Resist.

07:32.150 --> 07:34.471
All right, okay, okay.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.544
Lucas?

07:35.580 --> 07:37.047
Could be bursitis,

07:37.090 --> 07:38.739
but I'm thinking some
kind of labrum tear,

07:38.790 --> 07:40.917
maybe a torn tendon.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.951
Like I said, you need
to get an MRI,

07:42.990 --> 07:45.083
have it checked out
by an actual doctor.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.121
I'm sorry, "like you said"?

07:47.160 --> 07:49.720
Look, you also said
that PT might be enough.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.590
Ugh...
Enough to stop
you screaming every time

07:51.630 --> 07:53.268
you roll over on it
in the middle of the night.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.530
Keeping you operational
is a different matter.

07:55.570 --> 07:56.901
Okay, look, what are we
talking about

07:56.940 --> 07:58.066
N-No-- take it easy.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.202
We're not there yet.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.834
For now,
I'm just recommending

08:01.880 --> 08:03.871
he go for the scan.
Depending what that shows,

08:03.910 --> 08:05.548
we can start talking surgery.

08:05.580 --> 08:06.808
It's a bad time.

08:06.850 --> 08:07.976
Look, we got a deployment
in three weeks.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.988
Just... just give us a second.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.110
I cannot miss
deployment, Jason.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.958
No, no. You're no good to anyone
if you're injured.

08:15.990 --> 08:16.854
I am fine.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.554
You're not fine.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.624
You're injured.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.867
We got a spin-up.
All right.

08:22.900 --> 08:23.696
Uh-uh. You're staying here.

08:23.730 --> 08:25.721
You're gonna sit this one out.
Jason.

08:25.770 --> 08:26.998
You're gonna sit the one out.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.268
Get the MRI,

08:28.300 --> 08:30.905
see the doctor,
see what he says. And then,

08:30.940 --> 08:32.931
we'll talk
about deployment.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.743
Good afternoon, people.

08:40.780 --> 08:43.613
Agent Dyer's about to read you
in on an op she's been running.

08:43.650 --> 08:44.844
Before she does...

08:44.890 --> 08:46.619
BLACKBURN:
All right, listen up.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.548
For the duration of this op,

08:48.590 --> 08:50.820
we are being temporarily granted
a read-on,

08:50.860 --> 08:53.590
which gives us access

08:53.630 --> 08:55.723
to Restricted Data, as defined

08:55.760 --> 08:57.864
by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.731
Well, that's not good.

08:59.770 --> 09:01.863
Ladies and gentlemen,
I need a verbal acknowledgement

09:01.900 --> 09:04.630
from each of you that you
understand this read-on

09:04.670 --> 09:06.809
in no way implies
any future access

09:06.840 --> 09:09.001
to compartmentalized
infor|n|1ation.
a.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.598
Are we sitting in an exit row?

09:10.650 --> 09:11.969
Make you proud to
be an American.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.671
ALL: Yes.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.312
You remember, last year,

09:15.350 --> 09:16.942
someone stole three barrels

09:16.990 --> 09:18.719
of radioactive material
from the research lab

09:18.750 --> 09:19.956
at the University of Riga
in Latvia?

09:19.990 --> 09:21.150
Well,

09:21.190 --> 09:23.283
a few months ago,
some Ukrainian mob guys

09:23.330 --> 09:25.958
started shopping what they
called "ready-made dirty bombs."

09:25.990 --> 09:27.924
So they strap the explosives

09:27.960 --> 09:29.769
to the stolen
radioactive material?

09:29.800 --> 09:30.994
We believe so.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.167
Our asset never actually got

09:32.200 --> 09:33.758
to see what they were selling.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.597
_ _You have a_source
lnSIde the Ukrainian mob?

09:35.640 --> 09:37.164
We did.
You did.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.678
He was trying to contact us
shortly before he was killed.

09:39.710 --> 09:42.201
CLAY: We don't exactly know
what they're selling, right?

09:42.240 --> 09:43.798
But do we know
where they're selling it?

09:43.850 --> 09:45.101
MANDY:
Port Varna.

09:45.150 --> 09:47.948
It's in Bulgaria,
on the Black Sea.

09:47.980 --> 09:49.948
Far as where
they're going after that...

09:49.990 --> 09:53.312
Obviously, a dirty bomb's
not a battlefield weapon.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.884
Only way the buyer gets
value for his buck

09:54.920 --> 09:56.683
is if the blast goes off
in the city.

09:56.730 --> 09:57.754
SONNY: I don't
suppose we have

09:57.790 --> 09:59.280
any idea where it is right now?

09:59.330 --> 10:01.958
According to last contact
with our asset,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.867
the plan was to transport the
shipment overland to Port Varna.

10:04.900 --> 10:06.697
This is their convoy.

10:06.740 --> 10:07.889
And how long is that drive?

10:07.940 --> 10:09.362
MANDY: Rate
they were going,

10:09.400 --> 10:11.004
day and a half.
SONNY: So we fly into Bulgaria,

10:11.040 --> 10:12.337
get ahead of them.

10:12.370 --> 10:13.928
Yeah._
Set up a meeting spot,

10:13.980 --> 10:16.039
take down the buyer
and the seller at the same time.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.377
BLACKB_U RN:
Negahve.

10:17.410 --> 10:19.105
Command wants us

10:19.150 --> 10:21.118
to hit them in transit
prior to the meet.

10:21.150 --> 10:23.311
Our job is to interdict
the trucks,

10:23.350 --> 10:24.942
then secure the site

10:24.990 --> 10:27.049
while our nuclear expert,

10:27.090 --> 10:29.081
Dr. Dyer, confirms
the cargo.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.883
Then, we keep
the area secure

10:30.930 --> 10:33.956
till the extraction team can
load the cargo onto the helos.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.150
So, we're a containment team.
LEIGH: Yes. We can't
let this material near

10:36.200 --> 10:37.690
a populated area.

10:37.730 --> 10:39.027
Thing about a dirty bomb,

10:39.070 --> 10:41.231
it's not the initial blast
that's so devastating.

10:41.270 --> 10:43.306
Set one off in Times Square,
you might only kill

10:43.340 --> 10:46.138
a few hundred people
with the blast.
"Only-ll

10:46.170 --> 10:48.138
MANDY: The point is,
the real destruction

10:48.180 --> 10:50.444
comes from the dispersion
of radioactivity.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.142
Render that whole part
of the city uninhabitable.

10:53.180 --> 10:54.909
For how long?

10:54.950 --> 10:55.974
Depends on the quantity

10:56.020 --> 10:57.783
and radioactive half-life
of the material used.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.185
So let's say they used

10:59.220 --> 11:01.154
everything they took
from the lab.

11:01.190 --> 11:02.851
It's difficult
to be precrse.

11:02.890 --> 11:03.879
Ballpark?

11:04.490 --> 11:05.821
1,000 years.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.939
What, you got nothing
better to do

11:28.980 --> 11:31.949
at 3:00 in the morning
than come visit us?

11:31.990 --> 11:34.356
I just had to make sure
you had your toothbrush.

11:34.390 --> 11:37.951
Look at that, huh.
Thanks.
Oh, yeah.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.220
You know this is
the first spin-up

11:40.260 --> 11:41.818
I haven't been on
with you guys.

11:41.860 --> 11:43.225
Yeah, and don't I know it.

11:43.270 --> 11:46.091
Sonny's been practicing
his Bravo 25 all night.

11:46.130 --> 11:47.233
Bravo 2.

11:47.270 --> 11:48.965
Bravo 2,'Bravo 2.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.059
I heard that.

11:53.010 --> 11:55.205
You need me to give the strap
the old Ray pep talk?

11:55.240 --> 11:57.208
Davis has got it.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.239
Well, uh, yeah,

11:58.280 --> 12:00.441
well, watch your backs
out there,

12:00.480 --> 12:03.210
and for God sakes,
don't let Sonny near the doctor.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.480
I heard that, too.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.408
Hold on a second. What doctor?

12:07.460 --> 12:09.052
The strap, Leigh Dyer.

12:09.090 --> 12:10.887
She's a doctor?

12:10.930 --> 12:12.158
Woo.

12:12.190 --> 12:15.398
Yes, with a PhD.
PhD Leigh.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.318
In nuclear physics.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.462
Mandy told me.
Man, you know what?

12:18.500 --> 12:20.388
You guys got to stop spacing out
during the briefings.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.000
That's why we have you.

12:24.810 --> 12:25.765
Yeah.

12:25.810 --> 12:26.879
Toothbrush.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.913
Hey, so, uh...

12:39.960 --> 12:41.484
Now that I'm Ray for the day,

12:41.520 --> 12:43.920
does this mean that
I got to start gomg to church?

12:43.960 --> 12:45.928
No, you're not Ray for the day.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.518
No one's asking you
to be Ray for the day.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.120
I want you to be you.
Do want you to know, though,

12:50.170 --> 12:52.365
that I'll be using you
more than usual

12:52.400 --> 12:54.095
as a sounding board out there,
you understand?

12:54.140 --> 12:55.129
Roger that.
I want you

12:55.170 --> 12:57.559
to think before you
get all aggro at a situation.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.838
All right.
Yeah?

12:58.870 --> 13:00.428
So don't lose my temper

13:00.480 --> 13:02.368
until it's time
to lose my temper.

13:02.410 --> 13:03.502
Just don't lose
your temper.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.201
Come on, grasshopper, think.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.544
Hi, it's Emma.
Why aren't you texting me?

13:10.590 --> 13:12.319
Hi, Emma. It's Dad.

13:12.350 --> 13:14.386
I know that, uh,
it's early there,

13:14.420 --> 13:16.980
but, look, your Mom and I,
we had a conversation,

13:17.030 --> 13:19.999
and we just don't feel like
it's best for you

13:20.030 --> 13:22.965
to go to the Narrows with Lily
this weekend, all right?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.262
It's not that we
don't trust you,

13:24.300 --> 13:26.996
it's just that we just don't
trust the world.

13:27.040 --> 13:27.938
All right, listen, I'll, uh...

13:27.970 --> 13:29.835
I'll call you when
I get close to a phone.

13:29.870 --> 13:32.065
I don't know when that's
gonna be, but, um...

13:32.110 --> 13:34.078
give your mom and your brother
a kiss for me, all right?

13:34.110 --> 13:35.930
Love you.

13:51.030 --> 13:54.352
SONNY: Bravo 1,
convoy is 50 meters out.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.198
JASON: Copy, Bravo 2.
We're in position.

14:22.290 --> 14:24.383
Well, that was easy.

14:25.530 --> 14:27.998
Ray should sit out more often.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.231
Hey, boss, you better come
take a look back here.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.335
Find the doc's isotopes?

14:41.380 --> 14:44.406
No sign of the isotopes,
but take a look at this.

14:45.680 --> 14:46.647
Oh, ho.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.477
Okay, look at that, huh.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.239
Haven't seen one of these
In a long time.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.985
It's kind of different,
but it looks like

14:53.020 --> 14:54.612
a one-five-five artillery shell.

14:54.660 --> 14:55.957
It's a on_e-five-two.
Sovret era.

14:55.990 --> 14:57.981
Huh.
Why'd they strap it down?

14:58.030 --> 14:59.554
Come on. They
strapped it down

14:59.590 --> 15:00.989
because they don't want
this thing bouncing around.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.622
What, it's 30 years old?
They got it

15:02.660 --> 15:04.218
packed in with a bunch
of other explosives.

15:04.270 --> 15:05.623
Well, you know what,
they are Ukrainian.

15:05.670 --> 15:07.194
They are a bit crazy.
That is true.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.435
And those guys do not look
like they care about much.

15:09.470 --> 15:11.665
Both the other trucks
had the exact same setup.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.031
Same setup?
Yeah.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.638
Yeah, just boxes
of AKs and explosives,

15:15.680 --> 15:17.238
one single shell
strapped down the middle.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.139
Shut him up.
Hey.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.447
LEIGH: It's okay.
Let them talk.

15:32.460 --> 15:33.722
What's going on?

15:33.760 --> 15:36.024
He's saying it's nuclear.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.267
Oh, good thing we brought
our dirty bomb expert.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.097
No, no, you're not...

15:40.140 --> 15:41.493
He's saying this
isn't a dirty bomb.

15:41.540 --> 15:44.202
They didn't need
to weaponize anything.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.702
This... is a nuclear warhead.

15:55.380 --> 15:56.574
Best guess is a ZBV3 shell

15:56.620 --> 15:59.987
designed to be fired
by a standard howitzer.

16:00.020 --> 16:03.023
Detonating nukes of that size
would give you a yield of

16:03.060 --> 16:04.550
one kiloton each.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.421
Tell me you know that
off the top of your head.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.688
DAVIS:
I Googled it.

16:07.730 --> 16:09.425
Shells that old
are very unstable.

16:09.460 --> 16:12.429
They tell you where
they found them?

16:12.470 --> 16:13.562
Abandoned Soviet warehouse
up north.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.692
Plenty of those.
Yeah.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.129
Boss.

16:17.170 --> 16:18.535
Yeah, okay, uh, listen,

16:18.570 --> 16:20.208
I'll call you back.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.446
Got to assume the shells
are real unstable.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.674
Yeah, well,
you got to figure,

16:25.710 --> 16:27.678
you know, they've been
sitting on the shelves

16:27.720 --> 16:30.245
for a few decades now, right?

16:30.290 --> 16:31.541
Chopper's en route to
pick up the prisoners.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.150
Can we separate the warheads
from the shells?

16:34.190 --> 16:35.680
I think that would
be a mistake.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.426
Much as we'd have
to jostle those things

16:37.460 --> 16:41.248
cutting them out of there,
loading them onto a chopper...

16:41.300 --> 16:43.598
Plus, the choppers aren't
set up to deal with this.

16:43.630 --> 16:45.996
CLAY:
There is another option.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.237
The roads out here don't
look terrible.

16:47.270 --> 16:49.067
Why don't we just drive out?

16:49.100 --> 16:50.636
Clay, we're a containment team.

16:50.670 --> 16:53.776
Our job was to find 'em,
secure 'em, not get rid of 'em.

16:53.810 --> 16:55.368
You got a place in mind?
Yeah.

16:55.410 --> 16:57.105
Marculesti Air Force Base.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.174
Keep 'em in the truck.

16:58.210 --> 16:59.302
'Cause we know they made it

16:59.350 --> 17:00.339
this far in the trucks.

17:00.380 --> 17:01.517
Devil you know.

17:04.550 --> 17:06.541
ERIC: If the doc says we
leave them strapped in,

17:06.590 --> 17:08.251
then we leave them strapped in.

17:08.290 --> 17:10.383
All detainees are loaded
onto the chopper

17:10.430 --> 17:12.580
and headed back to us.

17:12.630 --> 17:13.824
Bravo's getting
in the trucks now.

17:13.860 --> 17:16.055
Copy, Bravo 1.
Better get moving.

17:16.100 --> 17:16.998
Half hour to sun up.

17:17.030 --> 17:18.167
If someone comes looking
for their weapons,

17:18.200 --> 17:19.394
be nice to have a head start.

17:19.430 --> 17:21.295
Roger. Moving now.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.466
TOC out.

17:29.810 --> 17:32.370
If the physical therapist said
you have to see a doctor,

17:32.410 --> 17:33.718
then you have
to see a doctor.

17:33.750 --> 17:34.842
It's not that simple, baby.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.370
The second I see a Naw doctor,

17:36.420 --> 17:37.614
the decision's
out of our hands.

17:37.650 --> 17:39.186
Doc says I don't get
deployable status,

17:39.220 --> 17:40.448
that's it, we're done.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.515
It's dangerous enough to deploy

17:42.560 --> 17:44.619
without going into it
already injured.

17:44.660 --> 17:45.627
And I get that.

17:45.660 --> 17:47.423
But what's the alternative

17:47.460 --> 17:49.394
You can't make this
about the money.

17:49.430 --> 17:50.499
We're not gonna
be out in the street

17:50.530 --> 17:51.497
because you missed
one deployment.

17:51.530 --> 17:52.497
If you can't pay the mortgage,

17:52.530 --> 17:54.191
you generally end out
on the street, honey.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.434
That's all I'm saying.

17:55.470 --> 17:57.506
We can pay the
mortgage, Raymond.

17:57.540 --> 18:00.839
Naima, we went over
those numbers together.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.575
The budget's built around
my Hazardous Duty Pay.

18:02.610 --> 18:03.645
Without it...
Look,

18:03.680 --> 18:07.218
I know it's scary
to give up the little control

18:07.250 --> 18:09.343
we have over our lives
to some Naw doctor

18:09.380 --> 18:11.211
that doesn't know
anything about us

18:11.250 --> 18:14.458
except your name,
rank and serial number.

18:14.490 --> 18:17.880
But this family depends
on you being healthy.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.649
Until you become an instructor
or whatever you want

18:20.700 --> 18:23.498
and do your 20 and get out
with a pension.

18:23.530 --> 18:26.465
If I'm able to deploy, honey,
I'm gonna deploy.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.365
But you need a doctor
to tell you that.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.436
You say you don't want
to put us at risk,

18:30.470 --> 18:31.732
but if you
don't see someone,

18:31.770 --> 18:34.637
that's exactly
what you're doing.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.908
All right.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.407
I'll call him.

18:38.950 --> 18:40.144
I'll call him.

18:40.950 --> 18:41.746
Thank you.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.349
You know you're
a lovely man, Mr. Perry.

18:45.390 --> 18:46.539
I know. Mm.
Mm?

19:10.580 --> 19:12.946
It's looking good for
a while ahead of you.

19:12.980 --> 19:15.278
The only real issue I see

19:15.320 --> 19:17.641
is this bridge 20 klicks
in front of you.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.386
The satellite imagery makes it
look like it's in rough shape.

19:20.420 --> 19:21.887
Yeah, well, we'll have
to cross that bridge

19:21.920 --> 19:23.285
when we get to it, huh.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.518
Sit them over here.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.628
And these prisoners claim

19:31.670 --> 19:33.262
that they never
called for backup?

19:33.300 --> 19:35.336
They're gonna claim
that either way.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.277
CLAY:
So how long has it been

19:42.310 --> 19:44.301
since you've been
downrange without Ray?

19:45.950 --> 19:48.418
A while.
Been a long time.

19:48.450 --> 19:49.940
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do

19:49.980 --> 19:52.380
if he can't go when we deploy
'cause he's still injured?

19:52.420 --> 19:53.614
What is this, 20 Questions?

19:53.660 --> 19:56.515
No, it's just I'm... planning on
having my own team one day.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.857
I want to make sure I'm ready.

19:57.890 --> 19:59.551
And then you watch
and you learn.

19:59.590 --> 20:01.455
As far as Ray goes,
if he's not ready,

20:01.500 --> 20:04.594
we'll just have to
cross that bridge, too.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.257
JASON:
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

20:32.290 --> 20:33.928
We're approaching
that nasty looking turn.

20:33.960 --> 20:34.995
DAVIS:
Copy that. I got you.

20:35.030 --> 20:37.624
But be aware the bridge
is just on the other side.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.558
Makes the turn look like
a piece of cake.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.634
Thanks for that.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.447
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.305
*

21:46.870 --> 21:48.531
If the bridge gives...

21:48.570 --> 21:50.765
We all go boom.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.677
Go forward... slowly.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.307
Slow.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.340
JASON : All right,
we're going one at a time.

22:01.380 --> 22:02.472
Once the first vehicle
IS clear,

22:02.520 --> 22:03.748
the second vehicle proceeds.

22:05.550 --> 22:07.040
JASON:
Easy.

22:07.090 --> 22:09.786
Stop. Stop.

22:09.820 --> 22:11.583
Left hand down.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.092
JASON:
Slow.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.836
Slow pace. That's it.

22:21.870 --> 22:22.962
Oh...

22:26.440 --> 22:28.476
Nice and easy.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.409
JASON: Keep going,
keep going, keep going.

22:38.450 --> 22:40.418
Left hand down.
Left hand down.

22:46.590 --> 22:47.557
Stop!

22:49.560 --> 22:51.619
Easy.

22:51.670 --> 22:55.128
Straight, straight,
forward.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.644
That's it, straight,
straight, straight.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.046
Straight, straight.
Watch it, watch the side.

23:12.150 --> 23:14.015
JASON: Nice leisurely drive
on a Sunday

23:14.060 --> 23:16.483
crossing a bridge, kid.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.023
DAVIS:
You're up, Bravo 2.

23:46.590 --> 23:47.989
Ooh!

24:04.070 --> 24:06.561
I'd feel better if you talked.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.547
I'm scared of heights.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.514
Not what I was looking for.

24:19.850 --> 24:21.784
I don't like bridges.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.723
Better.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.094
JASON: Bravo 2, this is Bravo 1.
You guys okay back there?

24:37.740 --> 24:39.503
Well, I just heard a big boom,

24:39.540 --> 24:41.804
and we're not dead,

24:41.840 --> 24:43.546
so I'll take that
as a good thing

24:43.580 --> 24:46.071
and a bad thing.

24:46.110 --> 24:47.247
Checking now.

25:12.610 --> 25:14.601
*

25:31.260 --> 25:32.955
JASON:
We need to move these nukes.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.026
What's the ETA
on the Black Hawks?

25:35.060 --> 25:36.254
Black Hawk is a no-go.

25:36.300 --> 25:37.528
The Moldova_ns have closed
the airspace.

25:37.570 --> 25:39.788
They're trying to get us to tell
'em what you're doing in there.

25:42.670 --> 25:44.001
Okay, so what we're gonna do,

25:44.040 --> 25:45.667
we're gonna get all three shells
into the lead truck,

25:45.710 --> 25:47.007
and we'll get 'em to the C-17.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.735
And we're about five klicks
away from the airfield.

25:48.780 --> 25:49.872
MANDY:
But the doc said transferring

25:49.910 --> 25:51.172
could set off the nukes.

25:51.210 --> 25:52.768
I don't have an option.

25:52.810 --> 25:55.210
It's what we're gonna do--
consolidate.

25:55.250 --> 25:56.979
All three shells,
put 'em in the lead truck.

25:57.020 --> 25:58.908
So what we'll do is
a two-man sling carry

25:58.950 --> 26:01.089
on each shell

26:01.120 --> 26:03.156
Good? All right,
so use the tarps inside.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.782
Hey, be delicate.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.821
"Delicate" is my middle name.

26:06.860 --> 26:10.057
MANDY: EOD doesn't have
a better plan than Jason's.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.328
Well, then, what do they have?

26:11.370 --> 26:13.759
Fatality estimates

26:13.800 --> 26:16.598
for when one
of the devices explodes.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.066
We better hope that
these gamma rays

26:20.110 --> 26:24.046
turn you into the Hulk
and not shrink your balls.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.298
You weren't thinking
about having kids

26:26.350 --> 26:27.305
and settling down
anyway, right?

26:27.350 --> 26:29.910
No. Hell no.

26:30.950 --> 26:32.144
Okay.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.886
You sure she said it was okay
to move these things like this?

26:34.920 --> 26:37.184
Fact is, she said
not to move 'em.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.687
On three.

26:38.730 --> 26:41.198
One, two, three.

26:53.140 --> 26:54.334
We're good.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.377
Okay, so, it looks like
these guys

27:03.420 --> 27:05.012
really didn't have time
to make a backup call.

27:05.050 --> 27:06.381
Yeah, but there's no way
to tell they've got

27:06.420 --> 27:07.887
a scheduled check-in.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.148
You're gangsters
in gangster country,

27:09.190 --> 27:10.657
and you know more
than anyone

27:10.690 --> 27:12.851
how dangerous
these roads can be.

27:12.890 --> 27:15.393
You're really gonna be satisfied
with a six

27:15.430 --> 27:17.193
And five, after you
murder our asset.

27:17.230 --> 27:19.198
They're gonna have
reinforcements standing by.

27:19.230 --> 27:22.393
I'm gonna start
talking to these guys.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.305
I thought we were
holding off our interrogations

27:24.340 --> 27:26.001
till the guys got back.
No.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.179
I just want to make sure
we don't wind up in trouble

27:28.210 --> 27:29.973
moving this slow,

27:30.010 --> 27:32.706
in case they have some friends
we should be worried about.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.843
All right.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.245
Which one you want
to take first?

27:36.280 --> 27:38.009
Who didn't have a partner

27:38.050 --> 27:39.881
when they picked up
the drivers?

27:39.920 --> 27:41.251
Number three.

27:41.290 --> 27:42.882
Over there.
Yes, snr.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.751
Probably means he's the
one that smoked out guy.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.826
Let's start with him.

28:08.880 --> 28:12.987
For an interrogation,
I don't speak at all.

28:13.020 --> 28:15.454
It's not an interrogation,
it's a conversation.

28:15.490 --> 28:17.117
I'm giving you an opportunity
to help yourself.

28:19.490 --> 28:21.458
I don't understand.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.995
Yes. You are. Ubiytsa. Killer.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.402
But, you know...

28:34.140 --> 28:35.903
You can still help yourself.

28:40.380 --> 28:42.041
How?

28:42.080 --> 28:44.389
Tell us how you were
communicating with the buyers.

28:44.420 --> 28:47.344
On the radio.

28:47.390 --> 28:49.085
Okay, what frequency?

28:49.120 --> 28:54.956
Two... three... two... dot...

28:55.000 --> 28:57.889
seven... six... five.

28:57.930 --> 28:58.897
Was there a code word?

28:58.930 --> 29:00.795
"Books."

29:03.300 --> 29:05.234
Look for anything
with the word "books"

29:05.270 --> 29:08.899
on frequency 232.765.

29:23.460 --> 29:25.519
Hey, are we in?

29:25.560 --> 29:27.926
We're gonna go slow.
Understand?

29:27.960 --> 29:29.496
Very slow.

29:29.530 --> 29:31.896
All right. Probably have us all
jump in the back here,

29:31.930 --> 29:33.522
keep 'em from swinging
into each other.
Yeah.

29:33.570 --> 29:35.891
MANDY:
Bravo 1, this is TOC.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.135
Go for One.
The buyers weren't happy

29:38.170 --> 29:39.501
when the convoy failed
to check in.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.838
They've got a private army
headed your way.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.029
Last radio transmission
pinged their frequency

29:43.080 --> 29:45.048
15 klicks to your west.

29:45.080 --> 29:48.174
How many, how fast?
Gonna be three vehicles.
Looks like about a dozen men.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.040
You better get to the airfield
before they get to you.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.014
You're gonna have to move
really fast.

29:52.050 --> 29:55.417
That's one thing we can't do
right now is move fast.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.826
DAVIS: You got a fire road ahead
about half a klick up

30:05.870 --> 30:07.064
on the right. Looks
like a rough ride,

30:07.100 --> 30:08.328
but it's gonna bring
you right to us.

30:08.370 --> 30:10.099
The problem is the bad guys

30:10.140 --> 30:13.837
are gonna catch you
before you get here.

30:13.880 --> 30:14.676
Yeah, well,

30:14.710 --> 30:16.302
a firefight
with these bombs on board

30:16.340 --> 30:18.376
could be a real problem.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.181
Split the team.

30:25.220 --> 30:27.211
How are you gonna do that?
You've got one truck.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.309
One's gonna take out
the strap and the ordnance.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.056
Four of us will stay here,
set an ambush.

30:32.090 --> 30:34.854
You're gonna ambush a force
three times your size?

30:37.260 --> 30:40.866
We're assaulters.
It's what we do, we assault.

30:43.100 --> 30:45.102
Let's start prepping
for an ambush.
Oh, cool.

30:45.140 --> 30:47.131
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

30:47.170 --> 30:48.979
I'm gonna find a place with
a flat field of fire,

30:49.010 --> 30:50.136
set her up, let her eat.
No, no.

30:50.180 --> 30:52.000
I need you to
drive out the strap.

30:52.050 --> 30:54.075
What?
I need you to
drive out the strap.

30:54.120 --> 30:54.973
SONNY: Yeah, I heard
what you said,

30:55.020 --> 30:56.271
but we're about to
get in a firefight,

30:56.320 --> 30:57.617
so why don't you
send the kid?

30:57.650 --> 30:59.481
I'm gonna teach the kid
how to do an ambush.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.351
Actually, the kid already
knows how to do an ambush.

31:01.390 --> 31:02.948
I'm gonna teach you how
to do one the right way.

31:02.990 --> 31:04.127
Remember,
watch and learn.

31:06.330 --> 31:08.025
Okay, Jason,

31:08.060 --> 31:10.096
we're about to get in a good
old-fashioned Mad Minute,

31:10.130 --> 31:11.358
and you're telling
me right now that

31:11.400 --> 31:14.233
you want Spenser
beside you and not me?

31:14.270 --> 31:15.999
You know what? Right now,
I need my most senior guy

31:16.040 --> 31:17.132
to step up, and that's you.

31:17.170 --> 31:19.035
Ray comes back,
you can go back

31:19.070 --> 31:20.628
to being a knuckle-dragger,
but right now,

31:20.670 --> 31:22.979
something happens to us,
I need you to get that truck

31:23.010 --> 31:26.104
as far away as possible.

31:26.150 --> 31:28.311
Leadership sucks.
Yeah, now you're starting

31:28.350 --> 31:29.942
to sound like Ray--
I love it.

31:39.130 --> 31:40.358
All right.

31:40.390 --> 31:42.392
I'm about to start this engine.

31:42.430 --> 31:44.660
You ready to hold them steady?

31:44.700 --> 31:46.395
Yeah.

31:58.310 --> 32:00.676
TOC says buyer's muscle
is five minutes out.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.076
Let's go.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.280
Move.

32:06.620 --> 32:07.917
Got it.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.028
Can you stop making that face?

32:15.060 --> 32:18.427
Well, that's my "there's
nothing to be afraid of" face.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.028
Well, you're really not afraid?

32:20.070 --> 32:22.288
Couldn't make that face
if I was.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.568
Seriously?

32:23.600 --> 32:25.067
We seriously
have more

32:25.110 --> 32:27.101
pressing issues at the moment.

32:27.140 --> 32:29.370
Like you babysitting
those nukes back there.

32:29.410 --> 32:32.140
Yes. And to take my mind
off of those,

32:32.180 --> 32:34.319
I'd like to talk
about something else.

32:34.350 --> 32:36.170
To take your mind
off being scared,

32:36.220 --> 32:38.711
you want me to talk about
how I am?

32:38.750 --> 32:40.945
Is that it?

32:43.090 --> 32:44.978
Look, I-I think we keep
the chatter

32:45.030 --> 32:47.180
to more operationally
relevant things.

32:47.230 --> 32:51.621
Okay. Is there anything else
I should know?

32:51.670 --> 32:53.524
I mean, I think we covered
the part about

32:53.570 --> 32:55.435
where you're supposed to keep
them things from swinging around

32:55.470 --> 32:57.688
too much back there. Right?

33:30.700 --> 33:32.133
What's a "Mad Minute"?

33:32.170 --> 33:33.432
Sorry?

33:33.470 --> 33:34.698
When you were
making the case

33:34.740 --> 33:36.537
to have the pretty boy
drive me out,

33:36.580 --> 33:40.505
you said to let you stick around
for the Mad Minute.

33:40.550 --> 33:42.541
It's a firefight.

33:42.580 --> 33:47.517
So, you'd rather get shot at
than be stuck with me?

33:47.550 --> 33:50.189
Yeah, I would.

33:53.290 --> 33:56.396
Something really pure
about being shot at.

33:56.430 --> 34:00.696
You try to kill them,
and they're trying to kill you.

34:00.730 --> 34:02.664
And by the way,
that Clay kid?

34:02.700 --> 34:05.464
He ain't that pretty.

34:25.530 --> 34:28.055
Come on...

34:31.170 --> 34:35.266
That is not good.

34:35.300 --> 34:37.461
Can we make it?

34:37.500 --> 34:40.731
We don't have much of a choice.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.475
Bravo 4, you in position?

34:43.510 --> 34:45.102
Bravo 4, set.

34:45.150 --> 34:47.641
JASON:
Ambush will initiate

34:47.680 --> 34:50.672
on his soil when the vehicles
are in the kill zone.

34:50.720 --> 34:54.156
Always doing Ray's
dirty work.

34:58.290 --> 35:00.827
LEIGH:
Anything you want me to do?

35:00.860 --> 35:03.192
Hold on.

35:03.230 --> 35:06.529
Got to hit it fast,
or we may get stuck.

35:24.950 --> 35:27.282
We're alive.

35:27.320 --> 35:28.810
For now.

35:28.860 --> 35:31.328
Depends what happens
at that bridge.

35:53.450 --> 35:54.678
Get 'em, boys.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.622
WOMAN :
Doctor's office.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.626
Uh, hi, yes, I'm calling
for Dr. McMaster.

36:13.670 --> 36:14.864
Who's calling?

36:14.900 --> 36:16.868
Senior Chief Raymond Perry.
Please hold.

36:16.900 --> 36:19.539
Sure.

36:22.010 --> 36:24.376
Dr. McMaster is not available.

36:24.410 --> 36:27.470
Would you like him
to call you back?

36:27.510 --> 36:28.841
No. No, uh...

36:28.880 --> 36:30.677
You know what?

36:30.720 --> 36:32.711
He doesn't have to do that.
I'll call him back.

36:32.750 --> 36:35.184
You sure?
Yeah. Thanks.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.305
Thought you said
you were walking back.

36:54.340 --> 36:55.830
Yeah. I found a ride.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.404
Yeah, they're not
really using it anymore.

36:57.440 --> 36:58.646
Where are the nukes?

36:58.680 --> 37:01.513
Agency's EODs have
already got them.

37:01.550 --> 37:03.415
They're, uh,
rendering them safe.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.711
A-ha! Hey, you and the strap
have a pleasant drive?

37:08.760 --> 37:10.387
Indeed we did.
Yeah?

37:10.420 --> 37:12.422
Stimulating
conversation, I bet.

37:12.460 --> 37:13.688
Ah, I believe so.

37:13.730 --> 37:15.288
I reckon she'd say
the same thing.

37:16.730 --> 37:19.722
You know, uh,
I don't know, boss,

37:19.770 --> 37:22.591
some pretty rarified air
up here in ZIC land

37:22.640 --> 37:25.438
and, yeah, I'm gonna be
pretty damn happy

37:25.470 --> 37:26.630
when Ray gets back to work.

37:26.670 --> 37:28.331
You did good, man.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.530
You did really good. Ah.

37:30.580 --> 37:31.706
Take a look at your knuckles.

37:31.750 --> 37:32.876
They're clean.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.442
All right. So you're telling me
you don't need any surgery.

37:40.490 --> 37:41.650
Nope.
None?

37:41.690 --> 37:43.988
None.
None. Nah, looks like
I just strained some tendons

37:44.020 --> 37:45.783
is all. Doc fixed me up
with some heaw-duty

37:45.830 --> 37:48.822
anti-inflammatories, told me not
to bench with a straight bar.

37:48.860 --> 37:51.693
Tell the guy that benching
went out in the '905?

37:51.730 --> 37:53.425
Damn straight.

37:53.470 --> 37:55.290
Okay. You're sure, huh?

37:55.340 --> 37:57.331
Stop being worried.
I'm good.

37:57.370 --> 37:59.065
All right, Danny,
I think I speak for everybody

37:59.110 --> 38:00.930
here at the table
that we would like to get

38:00.970 --> 38:02.437
some stories
from back in the day--

38:02.480 --> 38:05.574
Davis and Sonny,
and Team Four. Right?

38:05.610 --> 38:06.975
Uh-uh, no. Not a word.

38:07.010 --> 38:09.319
Well, it feels wrong to talk
about Sonny, with him

38:09.350 --> 38:10.715
not being here
to defend himself.

38:10.750 --> 38:11.944
Go right ahead, right ahead.
That's exactly

38:11.990 --> 38:13.582
when you should be
talking about him.

38:13.620 --> 38:15.611
But as far as, uh, Yeoman
Davis here is concerned,

38:15.660 --> 38:16.718
I got some...
Okay.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.421
It is Petty Officer Davis.

38:18.460 --> 38:20.348
And if you don't want
to get your butt whooped...

38:20.390 --> 38:21.618
JASON:
Oh, whoa.

38:21.660 --> 38:23.355
And if you don't...

38:23.400 --> 38:24.492
Guys.

38:26.530 --> 38:28.589
JASON: Hey, hey!
DANNY: That's my boy.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.097
CLAY: That's our strap.
What's happening?
What's up, boys?

38:31.140 --> 38:33.529
Ladies and gentlemen.
What's happening?

38:33.570 --> 38:34.969
Y'all remember Miss Leigh.
Hey.

38:35.010 --> 38:36.568
What's happening?

38:36.610 --> 38:37.702
DAVIS:
Hey, you can actually sit here,

38:37.740 --> 38:39.446
'cause, uh, Ray
forgot my beer.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.573
I did? Okay.
Yes. No sweat.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.747
What's up?

38:43.780 --> 38:45.509
Ray's back.

38:47.950 --> 38:50.111
Hey.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.787
Thank you.

38:57.630 --> 38:59.598
You know,
I can buy my own drink.

38:59.630 --> 39:00.961
I know you can.
Okay.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.594
Well, I really don't get it.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.437
What's that?
After all these years,

39:05.470 --> 39:07.404
you're still trying to
talk me into it? I mean,

39:07.440 --> 39:08.805
from my recollection,
you don't have a lot of trouble

39:08.840 --> 39:10.102
getting female companionship.

39:10.140 --> 39:13.405
I'm not the same guy
I was on Team Four.

39:13.450 --> 39:16.112
I look at pictures
of myself back then,

39:16.150 --> 39:17.742
it's like I'm looking
at a stranger.

39:17.780 --> 39:19.486
All right, so you're not
the same guy you were?

39:19.520 --> 39:20.544
Okay.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.911
All right, then, who are you?

39:22.960 --> 39:24.848
I'm a lot like you.

39:24.890 --> 39:26.551
Well, you're gonna have
to explain that one.

39:28.090 --> 39:29.819
Sorry, did I miss something
while we were carrying

39:29.860 --> 39:31.691
that nuclear
warhead somewhere?

39:34.770 --> 39:36.590
But you're not a frogman.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.131
They treat you like
you're one of them,

39:39.170 --> 39:40.933
they call you
by your last name.

39:40.970 --> 39:43.700
But you're not one of them.

39:43.740 --> 39:46.573
And neither am I.

39:47.780 --> 39:49.111
Look, "there's the operators,

39:49.150 --> 39:52.415
and then there's
everybody else."
Mm-hmm.

39:52.450 --> 39:54.953
So here's to the
"everybody elses."

40:00.660 --> 40:02.525
Is this the part
where I'm supposed to melt

40:02.560 --> 40:04.596
because you've seen
inside my soul?

40:04.630 --> 40:06.097
Nah.

40:06.130 --> 40:08.121
Melting comes later.

40:19.510 --> 40:20.841
This is Sonny's first
time getting a strap.

40:25.850 --> 40:27.078
RAY:
What's up, brother?

40:27.120 --> 40:30.487
Nothing, I got to go. I'll talk
to you in a little bit. Yeah.

40:38.730 --> 40:41.164
JASON:
I'm sorry. I get it.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.792
I-I understand,
okay... look,

40:42.840 --> 40:45.229
if you want to punch me
in the face, you can.

40:45.270 --> 40:48.068
I just want you to know
I called her from the plane.

40:48.110 --> 40:50.578
I told her
that I backed you.

40:50.610 --> 40:51.747
Okay?

40:51.780 --> 40:53.600
I know. She told me.

40:53.650 --> 40:55.618
You have every right
to be worried here, I get it.

40:55.650 --> 40:57.470
I'm gonna kill her.
No. Lis...

40:57.520 --> 40:59.738
It's not your fault, Alana.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.018
Just sit down.
I can't sit down.

41:01.050 --> 41:02.654
I need to see her

41:02.690 --> 41:05.022
so I can shake her
until she never does this again.

41:05.060 --> 41:06.482
Please sit, sit, sit, sit.

41:06.530 --> 41:07.986
Sit, sit, sit.
Fine.

41:08.030 --> 41:10.021
Sit down. Sit, sit, sit, sit.
Fine.

41:10.060 --> 41:11.869
It's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be fine, all right?

41:11.900 --> 41:14.198
We'll be okay.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.703
It's gonna be okay.

41:23.810 --> 41:26.074
I should come home.

41:26.110 --> 41:27.270
You "should"?

41:27.310 --> 41:29.039
I want to come home.

41:34.960 --> 41:37.713
Uh, is that an answer
to my question?

41:37.760 --> 41:41.059
You didn't ask a question.

41:41.090 --> 41:44.765
I know it wasn't an answer.

41:44.800 --> 41:49.737
Look, o-our family
is in extremis at the moment.

41:49.770 --> 41:52.034
Do you really think we
ought to be talking about

41:52.070 --> 41:53.765
big life decisions?

41:53.810 --> 41:54.970
POLICE OFFICER: Lincoln?

41:55.010 --> 41:56.170
Yes, yes.

41:56.210 --> 41:58.132
Yeah, right here.

41:59.650 --> 42:00.878
Hayes?
POLICE OFFICER:
She's coming out.

42:00.910 --> 42:02.878
She just wanted
to wash her face.

42:22.940 --> 42:26.034
I'm so sorry.

42:26.070 --> 42:28.538
I shouldn't have
been drinking.

42:30.310 --> 42:31.607
We know.

42:31.650 --> 42:32.639
Okay?

42:32.680 --> 42:33.772
Thank you.

42:43.820 --> 42:46.027
Come here. Come on.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.756
You okay?
Yeah.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.838
Okay, come on.
Let's go home.

42:56.870 --> 42:58.030
Okay.

42:58.070 --> 42:59.731
Come on.
