00:01.920 --> 00:03.820
<b>Alone?</b>

00:03.820 --> 00:05.820
<b>I'm impressed.</b>

00:07.380 --> 00:08.960
<b>Where do you want to die?</b>

00:10.190 --> 00:12.610
<b>I'll humor any requests.</b>

00:14.760 --> 00:17.920
<b>I'd prefer a deserted wasteland, 
with no one nearby.</b>

00:18.610 --> 00:21.060
<b>Since I'll have you screaming 
at the top of your lungs.</b>

01:42.990 --> 01:48.040
<b>Condition x And x Condition</b>

01:52.290 --> 01:55.770
<b>Uvogin seeks to unleash 
his rage upon Kurapika.</b>

01:55.770 --> 01:57.200
<b>And Kurapika intends to</b>

01:57.200 --> 02:00.040
<b>avenge his brethren against 
the Phantom Troupe.</b>

02:00.530 --> 02:05.420
<b>An inevitable battle is about to begin.</b>

02:07.820 --> 02:10.310
<b>Yep, there they all go.</b>

02:11.310 --> 02:13.130
<b>All of these are leech eggs?</b>

02:13.130 --> 02:15.070
<b>That's disgusting...</b>

02:25.760 --> 02:27.310
<b>Sorry about the wait.</b>

02:34.490 --> 02:35.960
<b>I've got a question for you.</b>

02:39.590 --> 02:41.670
<b>Who are you?</b>

02:46.350 --> 02:48.480
<b>You're no ordinary <i>Nen</i> user.</b>

02:49.010 --> 02:52.600
<b>I can sense a special intent 
behind your <i>Nen</i>.</b>

02:52.800 --> 02:55.090
<b>Before I can answer your question,</b>

02:55.090 --> 02:57.430
<b>I need you to tell me something.</b>

03:01.460 --> 03:04.780
<b>Do you remember the 
people you've killed?</b>

03:06.640 --> 03:08.020
<b>A little.</b>

03:08.680 --> 03:12.000
<b>I can remember the people 
who made an impression.</b>

03:12.890 --> 03:14.940
<b>So you want revenge?</b>

03:15.260 --> 03:17.500
<b>Who are you trying to avenge?</b>

03:18.320 --> 03:19.630
<b>The Kurta.</b>

03:20.570 --> 03:22.040
<b>Never heard of them.</b>

03:22.930 --> 03:26.890
<b>A small clan, with Scarlet Eyes, 
that lived in the Lukso Province.</b>

03:26.890 --> 03:28.140
<b>Five years ago,</b>

03:28.140 --> 03:30.080
<b>you attacked us.</b>

03:31.530 --> 03:33.940
<b>Scarlet Eyes? What's that?</b>

03:33.940 --> 03:35.900
<b>The name of a treasure?</b>

03:36.440 --> 03:38.770
<b>Sorry, doesn't ring a bell...</b>

03:38.770 --> 03:42.400
<b>But five years ago, 
I was definitely a member.</b>

03:45.570 --> 03:48.800
<b>When you kill a completely 
innocent bystander,</b>

03:48.800 --> 03:52.510
<b>what are you people thinking?</b>

03:52.510 --> 03:54.200
<b>What do you feel?</b>

03:56.340 --> 03:58.670
<b>Nothing at all.</b>

03:59.190 --> 04:00.300
<b>Scum!</b>

04:06.320 --> 04:07.930
<b>You will atone through death!</b>

04:13.420 --> 04:18.440
<b>Fools like you are the reason 
I never get sick of killing.</b>

04:19.390 --> 04:22.820
<b>Wanna know what I enjoy most?</b>

04:23.830 --> 04:28.450
<b>Denying those who come 
in search of revenge!</b>

04:49.790 --> 04:51.600
<b><i>Those chains are dangerous.</i></b>

04:51.940 --> 04:54.600
<b><i>I don't know what kind 
of trick he used on them,</i></b>

04:54.600 --> 04:59.200
<b><i>but they hold an abnormal amount of </i>Nen.</b>

05:00.540 --> 05:01.610
<b><i>Which means...</i></b>

05:04.070 --> 05:06.360
<b>Strike first to win!</b>

05:11.970 --> 05:13.620
<b><i>Got him.</i></b>

05:21.890 --> 05:23.340
<b><i>That's a surprise...</i></b>

05:23.860 --> 05:28.140
<b><i>After taking that punch, 
he still has the strength to attack?</i></b>

05:28.690 --> 05:30.890
<b><i>But his left arm is useless now.</i></b>

05:36.090 --> 05:36.910
<b>What?</b>

05:37.450 --> 05:38.840
<b><i>Unscathed?</i></b>

05:38.840 --> 05:39.650
<b><i>Impossible...</i></b>

05:40.600 --> 05:44.000
<b><i>Considering the amount 
of</i> Nen <i>in those chains,</i></b>

05:44.000 --> 05:48.410
<b><i>he must be a Manipulator or a Conjurer...</i></b>

05:49.320 --> 05:51.300
<b><i>I would guess the former.</i></b>

05:51.300 --> 05:56.180
<b><i>But only an Enhancer should be 
able to block my attack.</i></b>

05:58.450 --> 06:00.440
<b><i>What is he?</i></b>

06:01.420 --> 06:02.880
<b>Was that punch</b>

06:04.310 --> 06:06.050
<b>the best you've got?</b>

06:14.110 --> 06:16.570
<b>That wasn't even funny.</b>

06:17.110 --> 06:18.450
<b>Don't worry.</b>

06:18.450 --> 06:19.940
<b>That was twenty percent of my strength.</b>

06:21.300 --> 06:25.010
<b>This time, I'll use half!</b>

06:26.540 --> 06:27.830
<b>Here!</b>

06:43.590 --> 06:44.750
<b>Damn!</b>

06:53.410 --> 06:54.220
<b>Here!</b>

06:56.540 --> 07:00.190
<b>Damn, he keeps darting around.</b>

07:00.190 --> 07:01.100
<b>But...</b>

07:01.530 --> 07:06.770
<b>I'll regret not using that 
chance to chain you up?</b>

07:08.130 --> 07:11.360
<b>Stop making excuses, 
and give me your best shot.</b>

07:12.250 --> 07:13.870
<b>You're wasting my time.</b>

07:16.650 --> 07:18.300
<b>Okay, kid.</b>

07:19.270 --> 07:22.000
<b>I'll give you all I've got!</b>

07:24.370 --> 07:26.630
<b>That's an incredible aura.</b>

07:33.230 --> 07:34.250
<b><i>A smoke screen?</i></b>

07:35.190 --> 07:36.470
<b><i>His presence has disappeared.</i></b>

07:38.150 --> 07:39.640
<b><i>He's using </i>In!</b>

07:53.420 --> 07:55.560
<b>This time, I crushed your arm.</b>

07:56.000 --> 07:59.110
<b>No one can withstand</b>

07:59.110 --> 08:01.910
<b>a full-strength Big Bang Impact.</b>

08:02.370 --> 08:03.850
<b>But I'm impressed.</b>

08:04.440 --> 08:06.900
<b>You reacted immediately.</b>

08:07.400 --> 08:11.880
<b>I'm guessing you noticed the 
slight shift in the smoke.</b>

08:12.450 --> 08:14.360
<b>I am impressed, as well.</b>

08:14.970 --> 08:17.180
<b>I didn't think you knew how to use <i>In</i>.</b>

08:20.640 --> 08:23.820
<b>Striking the ground to 
raise a smoke screen</b>

08:23.820 --> 08:28.810
<b>was intended to conceal both your 
physical body and your presence.</b>

08:28.810 --> 08:29.650
<b>However...</b>

08:30.650 --> 08:33.200
<b>I, too, can use <i>In</i>.</b>

08:35.720 --> 08:37.280
<b>N-No way!</b>

08:41.710 --> 08:42.950
<b>You can see them?</b>

08:44.430 --> 08:46.310
<b>So you can use <i>Gyo</i>.</b>

08:48.290 --> 08:52.570
<b>These chains were fortified 
with a Conjurer's <i>Nen</i>.</b>

08:52.570 --> 08:55.800
<b>Meaning I can use <i>In</i> to 
render them invisible.</b>

08:56.360 --> 08:59.770
<b>So you kept the chains out to trick us</b>

08:59.770 --> 09:02.310
<b>into thinking they were real?</b>

09:02.310 --> 09:03.700
<b>Precisely.</b>

09:04.320 --> 09:08.760
<b>I pretended to be a Manipulator 
using <i>Nen</i>-controlled chains,</b>

09:09.270 --> 09:12.150
<b>so my enemies would only be 
alert to the visible chains.</b>

09:12.700 --> 09:15.200
<b>And my bluff just paid off.</b>

09:16.300 --> 09:19.200
<b>While you were making empty threats,</b>

09:19.730 --> 09:23.330
<b>my chains were already 
wrapped around your body.</b>

09:29.630 --> 09:31.960
<b>You've been captured.</b>

09:35.280 --> 09:37.720
<b><i>Damn... But how?</i></b>

09:38.370 --> 09:40.140
<b><i>He has an Enhancer's defensive power...</i></b>

09:40.470 --> 09:43.520
<b><i>And the </i>Nen <i>in his conjured 
chains is incredibly strong...</i></b>

09:44.800 --> 09:52.190
<b><i>Has he fully mastered both 
Enhancer and Conjurer techniques?</i></b>

09:52.190 --> 09:53.610
<b><i>That's impossible.</i></b>

09:53.860 --> 09:59.990
<b>
Act</b>

09:54.960 --> 10:02.870
<b><i>A </i>Nen <i>user can only fully master 
their innate category.</i></b>

09:55.110 --> 10:02.870
<b>Enhancer</b>

09:55.110 --> 10:02.870
<b>

Conjurer</b>

10:03.600 --> 10:06.180
<b>I see you're having trouble understanding.</b>

10:07.180 --> 10:09.840
<b>Let me illuminate you, before 
sending you to the other side.</b>

10:20.400 --> 10:21.640
<b>Those eyes...</b>

10:22.010 --> 10:23.640
<b>I remember now.</b>

10:24.580 --> 10:27.180
<b>There were a bunch of them, 
in the middle of nowhere.</b>

10:27.510 --> 10:30.150
<b>The boss really liked those eyes.</b>

10:31.380 --> 10:34.020
<b>They were pretty strong!</b>

10:34.390 --> 10:36.280
<b>Then, you're a survivor?</b>

10:38.510 --> 10:40.160
<b>I'm getting fired up...</b>

10:41.830 --> 10:44.360
<b>Let's see which is stronger,</b>

10:44.360 --> 10:47.790
<b>your grudge or my power!</b>

10:48.120 --> 10:49.750
<b>Bastard...</b>

10:49.750 --> 10:52.170
<b>Is that all you can think about?</b>

10:52.840 --> 10:55.550
<b>You'll never be able to break these chains!</b>

11:09.490 --> 11:11.810
<b>Why? What's wrong?</b>

11:12.550 --> 11:17.440
<b>When my eyes turn scarlet, 
I become a Specialist.</b>

11:17.960 --> 11:19.070
<b>What was that?</b>

11:20.430 --> 11:23.030
<b>When I am a Specialist,</b>

11:23.030 --> 11:26.390
<b>I wield full control over 
every category of <i>Nen</i>.</b>

11:26.660 --> 11:29.200
<b>Enhancer</b>

11:26.660 --> 11:29.200
<b>Transmuter 

Conjurer</b>

11:26.660 --> 11:29.200
<b>Emitter 

Manipulator</b>

11:27.070 --> 11:29.320
<b>And this is my power...</b>

11:29.330 --> 11:31.460
<b>Absolute Mastery
Emperor Time</b>

11:29.830 --> 11:31.460
<b><i>Emperor Time!</i></b>

11:42.930 --> 11:44.250
<b><i>Chains?</i></b>

11:44.250 --> 11:47.150
<b><i>Yes, when I heard about conjuring,</i></b>

11:47.150 --> 11:49.100
<b><i>that was the first thing that came to mind.</i></b>

11:49.780 --> 11:51.260
<b><i>Chains, huh...</i></b>

11:51.260 --> 11:52.690
<b><i>Why's that?</i></b>

11:53.300 --> 11:57.170
<b><i>Because there's evil running 
loose that needs to be</i></b>

11:57.170 --> 11:59.690
<b><i>chained down to hell.</i></b>

12:01.000 --> 12:02.700
<b><i>Really, now?</i></b>

12:02.970 --> 12:08.080
<b><i>I get the feeling that you're 
actually just chaining yourself.</i></b>

12:08.710 --> 12:10.250
<b><i>What would you know?</i></b>

12:10.900 --> 12:12.670
<b><i>Hey! Wait up!</i></b>

12:13.000 --> 12:14.580
<b><i>I'm your teacher!</i></b>

12:15.030 --> 12:16.540
<b><i>I'm not finished talking!</i></b>

12:16.540 --> 12:17.500
<b><i>Hold it right there...</i></b>

12:17.780 --> 12:19.280
<b><i>Didn't you hear my explanation?</i></b>

12:19.280 --> 12:22.440
<b><i>Conjuring ordinary chains is pointless!</i></b>

12:22.440 --> 12:26.680
<b><i>And conjuring unbreakable 
chains is impossible!</i></b>

12:29.450 --> 12:30.600
<b><i>Ignoring me?</i></b>

12:30.970 --> 12:34.100
<b><i>Man, you're so stubborn.</i></b>

12:34.840 --> 12:37.610
<b><i>It's impossible to conjure unbreakable chains.</i></b>

12:38.110 --> 12:41.360
<b><i>But it's possible to conjure 
something very close.</i></b>

12:42.120 --> 12:43.240
<b><i>Really?!</i></b>

12:43.580 --> 12:46.550
<b><i>Yeah, you only hear what you want to hear.</i></b>

12:46.960 --> 12:48.120
<b><i>What do I need?</i></b>

12:48.930 --> 12:51.120
<b><i>A condition and a condition.</i></b>

12:51.480 --> 12:53.860
<b><i>A condition and a condition?</i></b>

12:53.860 --> 12:56.340
<b><i>Yes, determine a condition...</i></b>

12:56.340 --> 12:58.540
<b><i>in other words, a rule...</i></b>

12:58.540 --> 13:01.890
<b><i>and swear to always follow it.</i></b>

13:02.260 --> 13:07.140
<b><i>The stricter the rule, the stronger 
the power it will enable.</i></b>

13:07.800 --> 13:10.890
<b><i>Normally,</i> Nen <i>is additive.</i></b>

13:10.890 --> 13:17.650
<b>(Attack + <i>Nen</i>) x Condition Difficulty</b>

13:11.310 --> 13:14.380
<b><i>But a </i>Nen <i>technique with 
conditions is multiplicative.</i></b>

13:14.820 --> 13:17.170
<b><i>Your strength will increase exponentially.</i></b>

13:18.200 --> 13:20.670
<b><i>Come up with a rule for your chains.</i></b>

13:21.020 --> 13:23.550
<b><i>One that you are prepared to follow.</i></b>

13:24.480 --> 13:26.640
<b><i>But let me warn you...</i></b>

13:26.640 --> 13:29.530
<b><i>This technique is very volatile.</i></b>

13:29.850 --> 13:31.670
<b><i>It's a double-edged sword.</i></b>

13:31.670 --> 13:37.920
<b><i>If you break the rule you set, 
you could lose your </i>Nen.</b>

13:40.050 --> 13:41.880
<b><i>My objective is to find</i></b>

13:41.880 --> 13:43.670
<b><i>my brethren's Scarlet Eyes</i></b>

13:44.420 --> 13:46.180
<b><i>and to capture the spiders.</i></b>

13:46.730 --> 13:50.080
<b><i>I want chains that are</i></b>

13:50.080 --> 13:52.630
<b><i>unbreakable by the spiders, 
the Phantom Troupe.</i></b>

13:52.630 --> 13:54.510
<b><i>The spiders will be my only targets.</i></b>

13:55.310 --> 13:58.670
<b><i>So the rule is that you will use these 
chains solely for that objective?</i></b>

13:58.670 --> 14:00.190
<b><i>That's a little weak.</i></b>

14:00.480 --> 14:01.770
<b><i>Don't get ahead of me.</i></b>

14:02.230 --> 14:07.200
<b><i>Using the chains exclusively on 
spiders is only the prerequisite.</i></b>

14:07.800 --> 14:10.200
<b><i>Then what is your rule?</i></b>

14:15.060 --> 14:16.730
<b><i>I'll stake my life on it!</i></b>

14:18.840 --> 14:21.090
<b><i>Hey, Kurapika...</i></b>

14:21.410 --> 14:25.090
<b><i>When your eyes are scarlet, 
your aura spikes.</i></b>

14:25.540 --> 14:27.580
<b><i>Could that mean...</i></b>

14:27.580 --> 14:29.490
<b><i>Let's try water divination again!</i></b>

14:32.000 --> 14:33.850
<b>A Specialist?</b>

14:34.820 --> 14:39.260
<b>You have full control over 
every other category?</b>

14:39.760 --> 14:40.850
<b>That is correct.</b>

14:50.160 --> 14:51.620
<b>Holy Chain: Healing Thumb</b>

14:56.020 --> 14:57.660
<b>I can use enhanced self-healing</b>

14:57.660 --> 15:00.870
<b>to completely recover a broken arm.</b>

15:02.030 --> 15:05.500
<b><i>I shattered that arm,</i></b>

15:05.500 --> 15:07.270
<b><i>but he healed it instantly.</i></b>

15:08.840 --> 15:13.260
<b>There were a number of reasons why 
I chose you to be my first target.</b>

15:13.710 --> 15:16.970
<b>While you fought the Mafia 
and the Shadow Beasts,</b>

15:17.890 --> 15:21.930
<b>the other spiders stayed out of it altogether.</b>

15:22.230 --> 15:25.730
<b>That told me you preferred to fight alone,</b>

15:25.730 --> 15:29.990
<b>and that they trusted that 
your strength would prevail.</b>

15:30.770 --> 15:33.990
<b>I prefer to fight one-on-one.</b>

15:34.370 --> 15:37.240
<b>That made you a perfect target.</b>

15:39.010 --> 15:44.870
<b>An Enhancer who was confident 
in his offense and defense.</b>

15:45.390 --> 15:50.260
<b>You met every condition I 
required for my first target.</b>

15:50.260 --> 15:54.860
<b>Because then I could test if my Chain Jail</b>

15:54.860 --> 15:58.840
<b>would be effective on the rest of the Troupe.</b>

15:59.680 --> 16:04.350
<b>Chain Jail forcefully activates <i>Zetsu</i> 
upon any Troupe member it ensnares.</b>

16:04.350 --> 16:06.940
<b>It also paralyzes them.</b>

16:10.310 --> 16:14.410
<b><i>So that's why I can't muster any aura...</i></b>

16:17.520 --> 16:20.870
<b><i>Zetsu</i> nullifies aura.</b>

16:20.870 --> 16:24.300
<b>Meaning you'd need to use</b>

16:24.300 --> 16:27.800
<b>physical strength alone to break these chains.</b>

16:27.800 --> 16:29.050
<b>Damn!</b>

16:29.370 --> 16:33.930
<b>If the Troupe member with the most 
physical strength cannot break the chains,</b>

16:34.540 --> 16:38.430
<b>the others will certainly be 
unable to escape Chain Jail.</b>

<b><i>His forced activation of</i> Zetsu <i>here is bad...</i></b>

16:43.820 --> 16:46.270
<b><i>Aura is the basis of all </i>Nen.</b>

16:46.880 --> 16:50.520
<b><i>If it's sealed off, you can't use your power.</i></b>

16:53.010 --> 16:55.600
<b><i>A technique for sealing </i>Nen...</b>

16:55.600 --> 16:57.980
<b><i>This guy thought everything through.</i></b>

17:10.470 --> 17:14.220
<b>It looks as though my enhanced fist</b>

17:14.620 --> 17:17.970
<b>is slightly stronger than your physical brawn.</b>

17:18.480 --> 17:20.290
<b>That's valuable information.</b>

17:21.690 --> 17:27.230
<b>Then I can beat every Troupe member 
barehanded, provided I've chained them.</b>

17:28.000 --> 17:31.480
<b>Tell me everything you know.</b>

17:37.070 --> 17:38.800
<b>Where are the other spiders?</b>

17:40.740 --> 17:41.990
<b>Kill me.</b>

17:50.040 --> 17:52.000
<b>What abilities do they have?</b>

17:53.120 --> 17:54.010
<b>Kill me.</b>

18:11.820 --> 18:13.650
<b>It makes me sick...</b>

18:14.640 --> 18:16.560
<b>The sensation left on my hand.</b>

18:17.190 --> 18:19.170
<b>The grating sound of each strike.</b>

18:20.140 --> 18:21.190
<b>The smell of blood!</b>

18:22.560 --> 18:24.870
<b>It all throws my senses into disarray...</b>

18:25.960 --> 18:31.170
<b>How can you do these things, 
yet feel and think nothing at all?!</b>

18:31.610 --> 18:32.930
<b>Answer me!</b>

18:35.860 --> 18:36.670
<b>Kill me.</b>

18:45.990 --> 18:47.610
<b>This is your last chance.</b>

18:48.250 --> 18:51.810
<b>I just placed a conditional 
bond on your heart.</b>

18:52.340 --> 18:54.810
<b>If you break the rule I set,</b>

18:54.810 --> 18:57.040
<b>the bond will activate,</b>

18:57.040 --> 18:59.320
<b>crushing your heart.</b>

19:00.070 --> 19:03.950
<b>Judgment Chain: 
Arbiter Little Finger</b>

19:02.260 --> 19:04.660
<b>The rule is that</b>

19:04.660 --> 19:07.760
<b>you must answer my question honestly.</b>

19:08.440 --> 19:11.860
<b>Abide by that rule, and I shall 
allow you to live a bit longer.</b>

19:14.540 --> 19:16.210
<b>Where are the other spiders?!</b>

19:19.660 --> 19:21.760
<b>Die, fool.</b>

19:44.190 --> 19:47.210
<b><i>I spent too much time in that state...</i></b>

19:58.050 --> 19:59.140
<b>It's me.</b>

19:59.140 --> 20:01.020
<b>Kurapika, what's going on?</b>

20:01.020 --> 20:02.870
<b>Why didn't you call?</b>

20:02.870 --> 20:03.910
<b>Are you okay?</b>

20:03.910 --> 20:04.990
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:04.990 --> 20:06.010
<b>I'm glad to hear that...</b>

20:06.010 --> 20:08.010
<b>What about on your side?</b>

20:08.010 --> 20:10.310
<b>The boss is safe. 
She's asleep in her room.</b>

20:10.810 --> 20:13.300
<b>Right, the boss' father won't arrive</b>

20:13.300 --> 20:16.130
<b>until late tonight, due to 
weather complications.</b>

20:16.470 --> 20:17.340
<b>I see.</b>

20:17.900 --> 20:18.790
<b>I understand.</b>

20:55.350 --> 20:57.110
<b>A chain user...</b>

20:57.970 --> 20:59.980
<b>He's either a Manipulator or a Conjurer.</b>

21:00.630 --> 21:03.460
<b>Uvogin is a dominant fighter.</b>

21:04.190 --> 21:08.260
<b>But in a one-on-one fight, he is most 
vulnerable to those two categories.</b>

21:09.240 --> 21:11.380
<b>Many Conjurers give special powers</b>

21:11.380 --> 21:14.240
<b>to the things that they create.</b>

21:15.120 --> 21:19.490
<b>Some of those abilities could 
render Uvo helpless.</b>

21:20.710 --> 21:25.090
<b>And a Manipulator could 
manipulate Uvo himself.</b>

21:25.090 --> 21:27.890
<b>I should have tagged along!</b>

21:27.890 --> 21:28.640
<b>Damn!</b>

21:29.710 --> 21:31.890
<b>If he fails to return by dawn,</b>

21:33.250 --> 21:34.880
<b>there will be a change in plans.</b>

21:38.010 --> 21:42.480
<b>Shalnark senses the danger, 
as Uvogin fails to return.</b>

21:42.480 --> 21:45.200
<b>Their leader, Chrollo,</b>

21:45.200 --> 21:48.950
<b>prepares to terminate the chain user.</b>

23:01.190 --> 23:02.940
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:01.190 --> 23:06.240
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:01.190 --> 23:06.570
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:02.940 --> 23:03.610
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.610 --> 23:05.410
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.990 --> 23:07.750
<b>It's Gon</b>

23:07.750 --> 23:08.490
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.490 --> 23:09.730
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.700 --> 23:19.370
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.730 --> 23:11.580
<b>Today, we introduce Uvogin.</b>

23:11.070 --> 23:12.660
<b>A Phantom Troupe member.</b>

23:11.580 --> 23:12.590
<b>A member of the Phantom Troupe.</b>

23:12.590 --> 23:14.420
<b>He has a giant body.</b>

23:12.660 --> 23:14.660
<b>A master Enhancer,</b>

23:14.420 --> 23:17.260
<b>His special attack is a <i>Nen</i>-infused straight right,</b>

23:14.660 --> 23:19.370
<b>with the Troupe's 
toughest, strongest body.</b>

23:17.260 --> 23:19.710
<b>Big Bang Impact!</b>

23:26.370 --> 23:28.870
<b>Next Time: Very x Sharp x Eye.</b>

23:28.870 --> 23:31.800
<b>So sharp, it's like a razor.</b>

23:32.200 --> 23:34.650
<b>Ooh, sounds great!</b>
