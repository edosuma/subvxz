to take him deeper
into the planet.

10:52.653 --> 10:55.353
That's too bad,
because we already
have an agreement.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.488

Nothing, really.

You have a problem with him?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.777
We need to be careful.

being a little extreme.

can't say I blame him.

Let us pass,
or I destroy the egg.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.357
(SPEAKING GEONOSIAN)

12:39.359 --> 12:41.893
Saw, you don't
want to do this.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.429
I know you believe
you're doing
the right thing, but...

12:44.431 --> 12:47.098
Our enemy shows no mercy.
Neither can we.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.366
If you harm that egg,

12:48.368 --> 12:51.269
you're helping the Empire
wipe out the last of his kind.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.138
The last of his family.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.776
(SPEAKING GEONOSIAN)

12:57.778 --> 12:59.277
I don't care.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.411
Yes, you do.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.746
I know you care,

13:01.748 --> 13:05.283
because you know what
it's like to lose family.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.418
Yeah, I know what it's like.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.821
I lost my sister
to the Separatists

13:09.823 --> 13:12.757
and my planet to the Empire.

13:12.759 --> 13:16.427
I'm fighting for you
and everyone else not
to lose what they've got.

13:16.429 --> 13:19.497
And I won't apologize
for how I do it.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.499
Then you're no better
than the Empire.

13:24.236 --> 13:26.004
(GRUNTING EXCITEDLY)

13:27.306 --> 13:28.807
They found us!

13:28.809 --> 13:30.408
We have to leave. Now.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.076
We can't take
him with us.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.511
Klik-Klak
belongs here.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.979
Hey, if we all get captured,

13:34.981 --> 13:37.182
that'll end this debate
real quick. Let's go!

13:37.184 --> 13:38.416
(GRUNTING)

13:38.418 --> 13:40.084
They're cutting us off!

13:56.335 --> 13:58.336
We've got rocket
troopers incoming!

13:58.338 --> 14:01.139
Ezra, I need you
guys up top now.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.340
Saw, can I count on you?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.209
In a fight against the Empire?

14:04.211 --> 14:06.077
(CHUCKLES) Any time.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.484
(RELIEVED CHATTERING)

14:13.486 --> 14:15.854
Good. Get up there
with the others
and buy me some time.

14:18.123 --> 14:21.559
What's your plan?
Well, we can't go up,
so we gotta go down.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.494
Looks like you get
your way, Klik-Klak.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.263
Klik-klak. (MUTTERING)

14:40.512 --> 14:42.146
Pesky flyers!

14:52.024 --> 14:53.958
(GRUNTING)

15:17.216 --> 15:18.950
(PINGING)

15:18.952 --> 15:20.818
They've got detonators!

15:21.854 --> 15:23.154
I'm on it!

15:24.089 --> 15:25.423
(PINGING CONTINUES)

15:35.267 --> 15:37.335
Those troopers
are in trouble now.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.976
Ahhh!

15:50.482 --> 15:52.383
Ooh!
Wait, what's she doing?

15:53.886 --> 15:55.219
Ah!

16:00.626 --> 16:02.727
I want one of
those jet packs.
I know.

16:07.967 --> 16:11.135
Captain,
our rocket trooper squadron
suffered heavy losses.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.570
How heavy?

16:12.572 --> 16:15.540
We lost them all.
Move the cruiser
into firing position.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.816
We can't stay
down here forever.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.684
(SPEAKS GEONOSIAN)

16:26.686 --> 16:29.187
I wonder how deep
this goes.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

16:29.189 --> 16:31.689
According to Chopper,
not much further down.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.158
And he's picking up
something on his scanner.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.260
(SPEAKING GEONOSIAN)
I say we check it out.

16:36.262 --> 16:39.364
Every second
we spend down here
seals our fate.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.999
We've come this far.

16:41.001 --> 16:44.702
If Klik-Klak thinks
this is the way to go,
I want to see why.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.371
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

17:04.857 --> 17:06.090
Over here.

17:13.632 --> 17:15.466
Those canisters.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.368
Imperial weapons division.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.936
They're for poison gas.

17:19.671 --> 17:24.008
There. Just like his drawing,
the circle in the circle.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.544
Now we know what
happened to his people.

17:29.748 --> 17:31.783
(SPEAKING GEONOSIAN)

17:34.586 --> 17:36.621
(SPEAKING GEONOSIAN)

17:38.891 --> 17:40.224
Ezra's right.

17:41.093 --> 17:42.760
The Geonosian belongs here.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.067
(SPEAKING GEONOSIAN)

17:49.069 --> 17:51.402
Those canisters are
all we need to prove

17:51.404 --> 17:53.704
that the Empire
wiped out its people.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.874
Everyone loses family
in war, even the enemy.

17:56.876 --> 18:00.711
The Geonosians deserve
the same chance
to rebuild that we do.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.181
(SPEAKING GEONOSIAN)

18:03.183 --> 18:05.650
Go on, Klik-Klak.
You're free.

18:11.290 --> 18:12.623
Where is he going?

18:17.129 --> 18:19.297
I don't think
this is the bottom.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.299
Maybe there are
other survivors.

18:22.734 --> 18:24.902
(SPEAKING GEONOSIAN)
Huh.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.638
They sure are
a resourceful species.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.113
(SPEAKING GEONOSIAN)

18:39.251 --> 18:41.752
I hope he finds a safe
place to hatch the egg.

18:41.754 --> 18:44.622
He's kept it safe this long.
They'll be okay.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.959
Okay, let's load
some of these canisters
as proof for the Senate.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.331
We are in position
over the opening,

18:53.333 --> 18:54.799
but there's no sign
of the enemy ship.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.834
They must have descended
deeper into the planet.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.070
Bury the rebels alive!

19:09.781 --> 19:11.716
The tunnel's collapsing! Go!

19:18.624 --> 19:20.258
They're trying
to seal us in!

19:20.260 --> 19:22.260
We're not getting
buried down here.

19:49.054 --> 19:51.656
The cruiser is directly
over our exit.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.224
It's blocking our escape!

19:53.226 --> 19:55.526
Their captain is showing
their inexperience.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.361
All hands,
fire forward batteries!

19:57.363 --> 19:59.697
Sabine, fire
proton torpedoes.

20:06.405 --> 20:07.772
Take evasive action!

20:17.649 --> 20:19.250
We've lost the canisters!

20:24.089 --> 20:25.923
(FRUSTRATED GRUNT)

20:29.761 --> 20:31.729
Unfortunately, all we
were able to recover

20:31.731 --> 20:34.031
were images of
the poison canisters

20:34.033 --> 20:37.001
used by the Empire
against the Geonosians.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.369
<i>The images are frightening</i>

20:38.371 --> 20:39.937
<i>but will not be</i>
<i>enough to convince</i>

20:39.939 --> 20:41.939
<i>the Senate of</i>
<i>the Empire's atrocities.</i>

20:43.942 --> 20:47.044
<i>They may, however,</i>
<i>help us recruit more</i>
<i>systems to our cause.</i>

20:47.046 --> 20:49.213
<i>Your intel concerning</i>
<i>these matters,</i>

20:49.215 --> 20:50.748
<i>acquisition</i>
<i>of a shield core</i>

20:50.750 --> 20:52.783
<i>and the rescue</i>
<i>of Saw Gerrera</i>

20:52.785 --> 20:55.519
<i>makes the mission</i>
<i>a profound success.</i>

20:55.521 --> 20:56.787
<i>Well done.</i>

20:58.690 --> 21:02.226
We also gave Klik-Klak
and his race a fighting
chance for survival.

21:02.228 --> 21:05.129
We still don't know
what the Empire was
building on Geonosis.

21:05.131 --> 21:08.699
Maybe not, but
they can't keep
it hidden forever.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.301
We'll deal with it.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.136
I just hope it
won't be too late.

21:14.039 --> 21:15.940
You're welcome.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.810
Ezra, you're gonna find
not all of our allies
share the same values

21:19.812 --> 21:22.613
or even fight the Empire
for the same reason we do.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.782
I've also got my
issues with Saw, Ezra.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.118
But in the end,
he proved he's not
the Empire.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.620
And for now,
that will have to do.
