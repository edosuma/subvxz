He's planning something. Something big.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.514
[groaning]

00:56.598 --> 00:58.725
Focus, Templeton. Facts on the ground:

00:58.808 --> 01:02.020
We've got Bootsy Calico,
a madman raised by kittens.

01:02.103 --> 01:05.148
He wants to make the world love cats
more than babies, which is...

01:05.231 --> 01:06.816
[laughs] ...ridiculous.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.861
Cats make doody in boxes.
Boxes, Templeton!

01:09.944 --> 01:12.655
Like medieval England
or modern-day Canada.

01:12.739 --> 01:17.077
No. Bootsy has to play dirty to win.
So what's his play? Is it a game changer?

01:17.160 --> 01:20.914
Is he changing the game? It's the game!
He's changing it. [whooping]

01:20.997 --> 01:23.583
This is a roller coaster
of corporate intrigue.

01:23.666 --> 01:28.087
You keep saying "play" and "game"
and "roller coaster."

01:28.171 --> 01:31.549
-Do you know what any of those are?
-He's no fool.

01:31.633 --> 01:35.136
He must've studied the same
past market performance tracking.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.721
-Work, work, work...
-[groaning]

01:36.805 --> 01:42.060
[Tim] There's no escape for Doug Peterson,
the dinosaur hunter who is also a robot.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.770

01:58.827 --> 02:00.995
-[squeaks]
-Ow! What was that for?

02:01.079 --> 02:03.081
I didn't want you
to miss the exciting part.

-Boys, we have an announcement.
-[Tim] Wait.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.050
Is it another baby?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.468
-[toy crashes]
-Ow!

02:15.552 --> 02:19.889
-No, not another baby.
-Not even a chance. Trust me. Ow!

02:19.973 --> 02:24.477
Got a coupon for tonight's grand opening
of a new family restaurant.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.230
And since it's been a while
since we left the house,

02:27.313 --> 02:30.984
we figured our wittle baby might be weady.

02:31.067 --> 02:35.738
Is the baby weady to weave the house
without making a big fuss?

02:35.822 --> 02:41.202
-"Weady to weave the house" for what?
-Templeton Family Fun Night!

02:41.286 --> 02:43.788
[gasps, shrieks] Family Fun Night!

02:43.872 --> 02:47.667
Yes! I love it, I love it, I love it!
Yes, yes, yes!

02:47.750 --> 02:49.919
Wait. You're not lying, are you?

02:50.003 --> 02:52.922
Because sometimes
people talk about roller coasters,

02:53.006 --> 02:55.258
but there's no real roller coaster, just--

02:55.341 --> 02:56.551
-[toy crashes]
-Ow!

02:57.176 --> 02:59.512
We're leaving soon, so get ready.

02:59.596 --> 03:04.142
Family Fun Night! [vocalizing]

03:04.225 --> 03:06.269
Yeah! That's my groove!
[imitates bass guitar]

03:06.352 --> 03:09.647
[Mom] Make that bass line walk, Ted.
Woo-hoo!

03:09.731 --> 03:11.316
Family Fun Night is the best!

03:11.399 --> 03:15.486
Mom and Dad just relax, and we joke around
and have an awesome time.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.239
I'd love some family QT,
but it's not a good time.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.116
Think Bootsy Calico's taking a night off?

03:20.199 --> 03:24.746
No, he's plotting. I have to counterplot
to keep babies number one.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.998
[in Italian accent] Is just business.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.876
[without accent]
Let's doodle in "Fun Night" another day.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.002
Fiscal October, maybe?

03:31.085 --> 03:34.047
But it's the grand opening. [gasps]

03:34.130 --> 03:37.467
I bet there'll be balloons.
I love balloons! We have to go tonight.

03:37.550 --> 03:41.429
-I don't have to do anything.
-You have to do everything we do.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.932
-You're a baby.
-And like all babies,

03:44.015 --> 03:46.517
I'm trained in the art
of obstinate resistance.

03:46.601 --> 03:50.688
Fun fact: Did you know a baby can add
50 pounds of weight by going limp?

03:50.772 --> 03:53.024
-[crying]
-[grunts]

03:53.107 --> 03:56.236
It's like he weighs an extra 50 pounds!

03:56.319 --> 04:00.698
This is going to be so much fun
once the baby calms down!

04:00.782 --> 04:02.700
Which I know he will.

04:02.992 --> 04:06.704
-[crying]
-Are we sure baby's ready for this?

04:26.266 --> 04:28.351
No. Eyes on the prize, Dad.

04:28.434 --> 04:34.482

if he knows what's good for him.

This isn't for you, Templeton.
It's for the good of Baby Corp.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.336
Public tantrums are terrible
for the brand.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.047
I'll be calm,
but don't mistake that for enjoyment.

04:58.131 --> 05:02.635
I get it. You're boring.
But don't stop me from having fun.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.013

-Remind you of our honeymoon?
-We honeymooned in Cleveland.

05:18.109 --> 05:22.155
Yeah, but remember the motel
had that palm tree in the lobby?

05:22.238 --> 05:23.990
[chuckles] Cleveland!

05:25.158 --> 05:27.702
You caught me at a bad time.

Okay. This place isn't all terrible.

can wait for an evening.

-What the heck?

06:06.699 --> 06:10.119
It's like a game. Get the menu!

That's... odd.

to read the menu.

06:21.839 --> 06:24.217

"Meowlk Shake"? All cat puns.

I can't decide
if I want a hot cat or a corn cat.

that here at Mr. Pineapple's,

Welcome to my humble café.

I hope y'all are having
a peach-perfect time.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.120
Especially this little cutie.

07:34.203 --> 07:38.374
I am just tickled he's here to see this.

07:38.875 --> 07:44.005
-Oh, no! Oh, my-- I'm so sorry.
-Thank you, but I can manage.

07:44.088 --> 07:49.886
I know babies can be very difficult.
More trouble than they're worth, really.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.389
Hey, I know you. Dr. Calico!

07:53.473 --> 07:56.559
You were our vet when we had the cat
who tried to kill the kids.

a restaurant where the whole town
can come together to eat food

08:14.118 --> 08:17.455
and love kittens, I suppose.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.583
How about that Mr. Pineapple?

That sweet, mellow ukulele playing
sure makes me love kittens.

08:32.136 --> 08:37.350
I'll say. Congratulations, Bootsy.
This place is the cat's pajamas.

-What are you doing here?
-[hisses]

08:52.782 --> 08:55.993
This is all wrong. Tell Mom and Dad
you need to go number two.

08:56.077 --> 08:59.497
I do not go number two
in public bathrooms.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.917
Exactly. I need to get out,
put a call in to the office.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.213
No way. This is Family Fun Night,
not Baby Work Night.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.048
No work stuff.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.801
You're not gonna do this the easy way,
are you?

09:11.884 --> 09:14.345
I'm not gonna do this the any way.

09:15.596 --> 09:16.430
[sighs]

09:17.515 --> 09:22.603
Forgive me, Baby Corp.,
and babies everywhere. [screeching]

09:23.813 --> 09:27.483
-What's wrong with the baby?
-What did you do to the baby, Tim?

09:27.567 --> 09:28.484
Nothing.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.320
[Dad] Shh. Shh. Baby want some toys?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.907
Hmm? [growls]

09:34.991 --> 09:36.409
-[crying continues]
-[chuckles]

09:36.492 --> 09:40.413
This is so embarrassing. The anchorwoman
from the news just gave us a look.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.623

09:42.707 --> 09:45.001
-Channel Eight, "Eye on the News."

09:45.084 --> 09:45.918
Big fan.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.337
Let's focus on calming the baby.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.631
-Maybe we should go.
-We can't just leave!

09:50.715 --> 09:53.676
It's okay. We haven't even ordered yet.

09:53.759 --> 09:54.719
No!

09:54.802 --> 09:59.473
-[gasps] Timothy Leslie!
-I will not let Family Fun Night end.

09:59.557 --> 10:04.437
The baby just needs to work off energy.
I'll see if there's a ball pit.

10:04.770 --> 10:08.816
See? Enjoy some quiet time.
Pick yummy appetizers.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.819
Remember, I don't like anything
with cheese on the inside,

10:11.902 --> 10:14.196
but I love everything with cheese
on the outside.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.409
Uh, well, if it means that much,
we'll give it a shot.

10:18.492 --> 10:23.497
-I am getting into this ukulele kitten.
-Back in a bit.

10:24.206 --> 10:26.959
Ugh!
Thanks for getting me out of that hotbox.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.170
Let me just call in some backup-- Hey!

10:33.049 --> 10:36.802
What's the play here, Templeton?
Torture? You don't have the stones.

10:36.886 --> 10:40.014
You made a choice. You joined a family.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.223
Here it comes.

10:41.307 --> 10:45.728
This is Family Fun Night,
and this place is really, really fun.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.649
This place is fun?
It's a breeding swamp for cat love.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.317
We need to burn it down.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.903
Just give us one hour, okay?

10:53.986 --> 10:56.614
Tomorrow, you and me versus Bootsy Calico.

10:56.697 --> 11:00.076
Tonight, put your work away and have fun.

11:00.159 --> 11:04.747
[laughs] You're talking gibberish.
Who has fun when work's put away? [grunts]

11:06.290 --> 11:09.669
We are not leaving this car
until you promise to enjoy yourself.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.129
[sighs] Fine. I promise to enjoy myself.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.092
-With family stuff.
-With family stuff.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.803
You're an inspiration. Amen.
Throw the confetti. [blows raspberry]

11:18.886 --> 11:20.805
Can I just... [inhales sharply]

11:20.888 --> 11:23.974
Can I get a moment to compose myself?
Alone?

11:24.058 --> 11:24.892
Okay.

11:30.022 --> 11:33.776
Staci, Jimbo, pinging my coordinates.
I need you here now.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.570
Sorry, Templeton.

11:37.613 --> 11:40.741
[Dad] Whoo, whoo! Pineapple! Pineapple!

11:40.825 --> 11:43.619
-Yeah! Sing it, Mr. Pineapple!
-Isn't this the best?

11:43.702 --> 11:47.415
A thrill. I've always dreamed of
passively observing Mommy and Daddy

11:47.498 --> 11:51.085
-turn into mindless kitten-lovers.
-Shoot us some mellow vibes!

11:51.168 --> 11:52.545
Your appetizers.

-What kind of clams?
-[Staci] Sending a pic to the lab now.

to get past the guard.

before he turns the crowd into cat lovers.

-[Bootsy] You need your din-din. Okay.

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Pineapple
is going to take a short intermission.

17:01.645 --> 17:04.982
Why? Because children ruined everything.
