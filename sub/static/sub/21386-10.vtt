WEBVTT

00:07.842 --> 00:10.174
Kane is in the building, nigga...

00:23.191 --> 00:26.228
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top

00:26.319 --> 00:29.152
When only heaven ’3 right above it, we on

00:30.615 --> 00:32.776
’Cause we on

00:32.867 --> 00:35.574
Who else is really trying to fuck
with Hollywood Cole?

00:35.703 --> 00:37.113
I’m with Marley G, bro

00:37.205 --> 00:40.322
Flying Holly Grove chicks
to my Hollywood shows

00:40.416 --> 00:43.453
And / wanna tell you
something that you probably should know

00:43.544 --> 00:46.707
This that
Slumdog Millionaire Bol/ywood flow

00:46.797 --> 00:48.378
And...

00:48.466 --> 00:50.422
My real friends never hearing from me

00:50.509 --> 00:53.501
Fake friends write the wrong
answers on the mirror for me

00:53.804 --> 00:56.637
That’s why / pick and choose
/ don ’t get shit confused

00:56.849 --> 00:59.807
Don ’t like my women sing/e
/ like my chicks in twos

01:00.436 --> 01:02.722
And these days all the girls
is down to roll

01:03.147 --> 01:05.559
/ hit the strip club
and all them bitches ﬁnd the pole

01:06.025 --> 01:09.017
Plus, lbeen sippin’
So this shit is movin’ kinda slow

01:09.737 --> 01:11.944
Just tell my girl
to tell her friend that it’s time to go

01:18.371 --> 01:22.410
Do you know San Francisco
is consistently voted

01:22.500 --> 01:24.866
one of the happiest cities in America?

01:24.961 --> 01:27.247
Then why do I feel
so miserable right now?

01:27.338 --> 01:29.750
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.626
(CHUCKLES) The only thing I'm wearing

01:31.717 --> 01:33.423
is a fucking noose around my neck.

01:33.511 --> 01:36.127
In the immortal words of Aaron Rodgers,

01:36.222 --> 01:38.929
R-E-L-A-X.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.386
-Oh, my God.
-This is not good for my hip.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.302
Oh, we get it, you're in shape.
Fuck you!

01:44.397 --> 01:47.480
So there's a competing offer,
and they stole our land,

01:47.566 --> 01:50.899
and they have the league's blessing,
and they have a shit-ton of money.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.810
Big fucking whoop.

01:53.114 --> 01:55.446
Competition is the cornerstone
of capitalism,

01:55.533 --> 01:57.649
and if you can't beat 'em,
fucking join 'em,

01:57.743 --> 01:59.119
you fuck them over later.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.194
That's a lesser-known
cornerstone of capitalism.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.245
-Thank you.
-I can't believe with the shit

02:03.332 --> 02:04.538
Candace put me through,

02:04.625 --> 02:06.411
suddenly she's on board
with another group.

02:06.502 --> 02:08.458
-Man, fuck her.
-Okay, you gotta suck up

02:08.587 --> 02:09.963
your foolish pride for a sec.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.833
Lean over the plate,
take one for the team.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.915
I promise it'll only sting for a second.

02:14.010 --> 02:16.001
Baseball analogies
don't work on me, Joe.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.461
Well, if we merge, we stay in the fight.

02:18.556 --> 02:20.467
There's no way that Wayne and Candace

02:20.558 --> 02:22.298
are even gonna cut us in fairly.

02:22.393 --> 02:24.805
Don't take this as a lack
of confidence, okay,

02:24.895 --> 02:26.556
but when you stepped into this world

02:26.647 --> 02:29.684
I told you would have to
eat your hat every now and again.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.606
Now, just seems like one of those times

02:31.694 --> 02:33.434
to break out the knife and fork.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.153
I'm just saying
my idea of our retirement

02:36.240 --> 02:39.198
didn't involve you settling
with a kid and Amber in California.

02:39.285 --> 02:41.025
It's just a visit, T.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.405
She trying to trap you, man,

02:42.496 --> 02:45.454
just like Kanye said
Amber Rose did to Wiz Khalifa.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.202
Both bitches even named Amber.

02:47.293 --> 02:49.534
-Don't call her a bitch.
-I didn't call her no bitch.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.664
I'm just saying a bitch
got an ironic name, is all.

02:51.756 --> 02:53.792
Look, a man gotta
take care of his family.

02:53.883 --> 02:55.748
We're his fucking family, Dennis!

02:55.843 --> 02:57.049
I gotta do this, T.

02:57.136 --> 02:58.717
New England ain't fucking with me,

02:58.804 --> 03:00.385
and I ain't chasing another contract

03:00.473 --> 03:02.304
until I get my head straight.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.768
News flash, nigga,
your head ain't never been straight.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.641
Maybe Amber could change that.

03:06.729 --> 03:09.471
Or maybe you'll just end up
neck-deep in sour titty milk

03:09.565 --> 03:11.977
and shitty Pampers,
wondering how you got there.

03:12.068 --> 03:13.979
And I ain't gonna be around
to remind you.

03:14.153 --> 03:15.893
Well, if the Lord Wills it, SO be it.

03:15.988 --> 03:18.900
Oh, now Jesus back in the house?

03:19.575 --> 03:20.860
You're gonna need him, man.

03:25.498 --> 03:27.113
That nigga's in love with you.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.408
-Spencer Strasmore.
-Oh, Jesus.

03:30.503 --> 03:32.789
-What is it, like the third time?
-Fourth.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.212
Somebody's needy.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.210
Hey, it's my new bestie, Spencer.

03:37.301 --> 03:40.168
You know, it's so flattering
being courted by an ex-NFL star.

03:40.262 --> 03:43.004
Do you want a piece of this or not?
I'm tired of fucking around.

03:43.099 --> 03:44.760
/ don ’t take a piece of anything,

03:44.850 --> 03:46.306
unless it's a piece of ass.

03:46.519 --> 03:48.134
I'll take that any day of the week.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.220
-What time you getting over here?
-We//...

03:53.150 --> 03:55.186
I'm looking for a parking space now.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.858
I should've known
they'd change their minds.

03:59.949 --> 04:02.110
The Chargers don't want
some Dolphins cast-off

04:02.201 --> 04:04.192
who was probably promoted
too quick anyway.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.698
JASON: I'm sorry that things
didn't pan out for you there,

04:06.789 --> 04:09.906
but the Rams got a spot open
that they wanna talk to you about.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.536
Let me guess, equipment manager?

04:11.627 --> 04:13.083
General manager.

04:13.838 --> 04:14.873
GM?

04:15.381 --> 04:17.622
The Chargers didn't even
want me as an assistant.

04:17.716 --> 04:18.876
No way L.A. gambles on me.

04:18.968 --> 04:21.129
No, they're shaking
things up over there.

04:21.220 --> 04:24.053
They just hired the youngest coach
in league history.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.179
Theo Epstein was 30 years old

04:26.267 --> 04:28.974
when he got the Red Sox
their first World Series,

04:29.061 --> 04:31.347
and then another one three years later.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.475
Yeah, then he reversed
the curse in Chicago.

04:33.566 --> 04:34.851
Cute like you, too.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.352
I think you and Coach would click.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.685
Owner's in San Francisco
for the meeting,

04:38.779 --> 04:40.770
so they got Mangini
running your interview.

04:40.865 --> 04:42.730
I stole this from Schneider.

04:42.825 --> 04:44.986
-Seahawks GM?
-Yeah, he's my boy.

04:45.077 --> 04:48.114
It covers everything from handling DUls

04:48.205 --> 04:49.661
to finding players housing

04:49.748 --> 04:51.875
to defensive and offensive schemes.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.245
-Take it.
-Yeah, but you stole from your friend?

04:54.336 --> 04:56.122
He left it in the car. I borrowed it.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.541
No, I can't grab credit
for another man's work.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.748
JULIE: Use it for inspiration
and make it your own.

05:00.843 --> 05:01.878
Like a rapper.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.254
Just read it fast,

05:03.345 --> 05:05.677
because your meeting's today
in Los Angeles.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.174
I already booked your ticket.

05:07.266 --> 05:08.972
(SCOFFS) So you expect me

05:09.059 --> 05:11.266
to learn all this
in five hours on the flight?

05:11.353 --> 05:13.139
You know most of it already, Charles.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.562
Besides, you'll be traveling
with an old study buddy.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.980
You can do it, baby.

05:25.201 --> 05:26.486
Mr. Anderson.

05:26.702 --> 05:27.737
Get out of my way.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.782
-Let go.
-Just hear me out.

05:31.874 --> 05:34.331
But the deal is dead.
Now let go of my fucking bag.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.242
-Nol
-Let go of my...

05:41.300 --> 05:43.382
Look, you can't go yet, okay?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.542
Julian's coming in to talk.

05:45.638 --> 05:47.970
I'm sorry, what?
You called my little brother?

05:48.057 --> 05:49.797
Yeah. Spencer did.
He called your brother

05:49.892 --> 05:52.258
because, with Wayne gone,
we need the extra firepower.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.595
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God, you fucking guys.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.554
Look, we didn't create this situation.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.686
We're dealing with it
the way we always do.

05:59.777 --> 06:01.984
Stop acting like
a bitch-ass little crybaby

06:02.071 --> 06:05.484
and just talk to your brother,
like a fucking man!

06:06.116 --> 06:08.493
What else are you gonna do?

06:20.381 --> 06:22.087
DEXTER: So what, you,
like, Vern's manager?

06:22.174 --> 06:25.337
REGGIE: I handle his important business,
like his suspension.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.213
Four games was a grave injustice.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.795
I thought Spencer
took care of Vernon's thing.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.348
l handled it. Walked down there,
dropped the truth.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.926
Next thing that happened,
Vern is outwith only two games

06:36.021 --> 06:37.761
and saved $2 million in salary.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.562
You the one got him on that weed deal.

06:39.650 --> 06:40.856
Should be a legit product.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.649
We made a lot of paper endorsing

06:42.736 --> 06:44.442
until the league started trippin'.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.021
When they finally take it off
this banned-substance list,

06:47.116 --> 06:48.856
we're gonna have a foothold.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.988
I also put us on the ground floor
with this virtual reality company.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.785
Paying off huge.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.822
A friend took me to one of them places
to play Call of Duty.

06:57.001 --> 06:58.366
The shit gave me PSTD.

06:58.460 --> 07:02.078
(LAUGHS) See, gonna change the way
the game is played and watched.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.912
And the sex stuff,

07:04.008 --> 07:05.748
nigga, it's off the fucking chain.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.549
I'd rather get laid for real.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.752
Like I said, you need
anything taken care of,

07:09.847 --> 07:10.882
I can handle it.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.055
-Hey.
-Hi.

07:17.146 --> 07:18.306
How you doing?

07:18.772 --> 07:19.807
Tired.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.268
Wayne flew me in late last night.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.645
-Well, a secret weapon never sleeps.
-(CHUCKLES)

07:24.737 --> 07:27.820
That wasn't the only thing
that was keeping me up.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.485
You really pissed me off.

07:32.161 --> 07:34.447
I know, and I'm sorry, and...

07:34.538 --> 07:36.745
And, you know, look, you know me.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.913
Right? I like to put things in boxes

07:39.001 --> 07:41.083
and then sometimes
I forget about the boxes,

07:41.170 --> 07:43.536
and then sometimes I leave them
sitting too long,

07:43.631 --> 07:46.213
and it's that same old thing, right?

07:46.300 --> 07:47.915
I gotta get better at it, I know.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.467
This isn't the time for that.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.920
Wayne has known about us for a while.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.755
He says it's a conflict of interest.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.966
That asshole calls us
a conflict of interest?

07:57.061 --> 07:58.972
That asshole put me in a corner office.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.270
All right, well, come work with me.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.690
Yeah, I got a lot
of great things going on.

08:04.777 --> 08:06.267
It'd be amazing.

08:08.113 --> 08:11.526
You're gonna lose this deal, big-time.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.732
Candace Brewer is in Wayne's pocket,

08:13.827 --> 08:16.489
and she has all the influence
Wayne needs to close.

08:16.789 --> 08:18.825
This is her golden parachute.

08:18.916 --> 08:21.658
She's stepping down
from the league once this is approved.

08:23.087 --> 08:24.497
I fucking knew she was dirty.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.671
Everyone involved in this
needs a fucking bath.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.498
-Everyone.
-(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

08:31.887 --> 08:33.923
I gotta go. Good luck later.

08:34.348 --> 08:35.383
Okay.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.175
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

08:40.312 --> 08:41.813
Fuck.

08:43.857 --> 08:44.892
Fucking dirty...

08:47.695 --> 08:49.526
Tell me why

08:50.447 --> 08:54.816
Is it so?
Don ’t wanna let you go

08:55.619 --> 08:58.361
Never can say goodbye, gir/

08:58.455 --> 09:00.741
Ooh-ooh, baby...

09:04.378 --> 09:05.493
You need help?

09:06.171 --> 09:08.583
I need you to shut off
the Jackson 5 concert.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.255
You just need to loosen up.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.422
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

09:11.510 --> 09:14.252
See, you too hung up
on these X's and O's, fam.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.758
The key to nailing a job like this

09:16.849 --> 09:19.181
is not to say too much,
but don't say too little.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.092
And how much is too much?

09:21.812 --> 09:23.143
More than you need.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.731
And how much is too little?

09:24.815 --> 09:26.180
Not enough.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.099
Real helpful.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.649
Thanks a lot.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.318
I'm saying you got the talent,

09:31.405 --> 09:34.272
you got the personality,
you got the passion and the skills.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.197
Yeah, but I don't have the experience.

09:36.285 --> 09:39.527
Well, the only way to get the experience
is to have the experience.

09:40.539 --> 09:41.654
Take being a dad.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.330
You got the experience with that?

09:43.417 --> 09:44.702
No.

09:44.877 --> 09:47.869
No, save a few books
that Julie gave me that I never read.

09:47.963 --> 09:50.830
And yet you're one
of the best dads I've ever seen.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.169
Those books don't make a difference.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.089
It's about the love and the instinct,

09:56.680 --> 09:57.920
just like the game.

10:07.191 --> 10:10.228
-Hello, big brother.
-Yeah, okay, hi.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.653
Spencer's been wooing me.

10:18.744 --> 10:21.781
When your boy here drops
the foul language and the name-calling,

10:21.872 --> 10:23.453
his ideas make sense.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.826
If you weren't
such a dick-fuck, prick-fuck fuck,

10:25.918 --> 10:27.954
then may be we wouldn't
have to call you a name.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.410
-Yeah.
-Ju|ian's here to help.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.041
Yeah. Help yourself with the profits.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.087
-Man, go fuck yourself.
-Go fuck yourself,

10:33.175 --> 10:35.211
-you little fucking cocksucker.
-Fuck off.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.463
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

10:37.763 --> 10:39.799
What the fuck?

10:40.349 --> 10:42.590
That's how you talk
to your own flesh and blood?

10:42.684 --> 10:44.345
God damn it.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.599
I've seen Josh Norman and OBJ
talk to each other with more respect.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.475
-Footbal| guys.
-Yeah, go to sleep.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.682
You guys are lucky
to still have each other.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.564
I'd give my right fucking arm
to still have my brother around.

10:54.655 --> 10:57.112
Someone who understands me,
someone I know who I can count on,

10:57.199 --> 10:58.814
who will always be there for me.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.321
Don't piss this away, okay?

11:01.411 --> 11:02.947
Because it's all gonna be gone one day,

11:03.038 --> 11:05.450
and guess what,
you'll never fucking get this back.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.710
Well, I'm not giving up control
for a few extra dollars.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.708
-lt's not gonna happen.
-You don't have to, okay?

11:13.799 --> 11:16.165
You guys'll share
control of the deal and the stadium

11:16.260 --> 11:17.716
during and after construction.

11:17.803 --> 11:20.340
You guys have the chance
to build something beautiful.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.465
Together.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.422
"Andersonville,

11:23.851 --> 11:25.762
"a place to bring your families."

11:27.104 --> 11:29.186
Think of the irony.

11:29.982 --> 11:31.893
I do enjoy irony.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.942
So, how do you mooks fit into all this?

11:38.240 --> 11:40.731
-We're the muscle.
-Yeah.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.691
I love family.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.660
But if you two don't
nail this presentation,

11:45.747 --> 11:47.362
then none of this is gonna happen.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.585
And we don't have land in Las Vegas,
but our competition does.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.580
We don't need land in Las Vegas.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.838
Yo, Dex, have a great night.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.256
Always do.

11:58.802 --> 12:02.465
Yeah, that's what I heard,
and Vern told me you got a problem.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.262
Yo, you told him?

12:04.850 --> 12:07.136
Man, my bad, bro.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.513
But Reg, he a good fixer.

12:09.605 --> 12:10.936
Ain't nothing to fix.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.355
Tape gonna leak
and all hell gonna break loose.

12:13.442 --> 12:14.727
Can I see it?

12:15.861 --> 12:17.522

-Baby, you look so sexy.
-Uh-huh.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.966
Don ’t be shy. Give me the camera.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.266
DEXTER: It’s all for you.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.139

13:05.994 --> 13:07.985
Man, that shit funny. It ain't nasty.

13:17.673 --> 13:20.130

More money than God.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.299
And married to Kanye, who think he God.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.001
Keeping Up is her favorite show.

13:24.096 --> 13:27.088
So if the tape just so happens to leak,

13:27.182 --> 13:28.467
then we got this.

13:31.728 --> 13:32.843

14:30.579 --> 14:32.069
Hell, I didn't even know about,

14:32.164 --> 14:35.327
but it forced me
to drill down on my priorities.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.500
My priorities are you and our child.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.461

14:42.382 --> 14:44.213
Can you give me another chance, Amber?

came out in the fifth round?

Really? Yeah.

16:10.053 --> 16:13.887
I figure we get the right back end
playing behind that D-line,

16:14.641 --> 16:15.881
Goff only needs to get us

16:15.976 --> 16:18.467
about 17 points a game
to make the playoffs.

16:18.687 --> 16:21.019
And that's all in
the binder you prepared?

16:21.106 --> 16:23.267
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Right there.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.519
Right there. Yes, sir.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.437
So, you need all this

16:30.532 --> 16:32.568
to tell us that our secondary is shit?

16:35.537 --> 16:37.368
There's other stuff in there, too.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.284
Like my philosophy on culture building.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.367
Look, you're obviously very bright,

16:44.004 --> 16:46.370
and Jason says a lot
of great things about you,

16:46.548 --> 16:49.881
but organizationally,
we need more stability,

16:49.968 --> 16:53.381
and my gut's saying that

16:53.555 --> 16:55.967
we're probably gonna go
in a different direction.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.016
All right. Thank you.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.307
Thanks for coming in.
Good luck to you, okay?

17:13.783 --> 17:16.035
You know what?
That book ain't even mine anyway.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.859
But if I had one, it would say that

17:18.079 --> 17:21.788
the front office is as much of a team
as the one that we put out on the field.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.786
Now, for me,

17:23.877 --> 17:26.584
Iwant coaches, scouts and players,

17:26.671 --> 17:28.207
all that are good teammates.

17:28.340 --> 17:30.126
Now, you don't win in this league

17:30.217 --> 17:32.128
by having the biggest
or fastest athletes

17:32.219 --> 17:33.880
or the highest payroll.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.428
You can't time, measure or put a price
on what's in a man's heart

17:37.515 --> 17:39.301
or his passion for the game.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.018
No! No, no, no.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.844
Heart is the reason Iwas
able to succeed in this league

17:43.939 --> 17:46.100
as a player and then a scout.

17:46.191 --> 17:48.432
And heart is the same reason
I know I'll succeed

17:48.526 --> 17:50.608
at bringing the Rams
back to the Super Bowl.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.613
Now what you think about that?

17:52.697 --> 17:55.109

that I wanted to interview.

-Yes, sir.

why the hell we stayed here again?

18:14.970 --> 18:18.007

those pricks we're competing against.

20:27.852 --> 20:31.891
football is not a game of escapism.

20:33.650 --> 20:37.313
I'll tell you why. When Khalil Mack
zeroes in on a quarterback,

or when Derek Carr
decides to tuck it and run,
