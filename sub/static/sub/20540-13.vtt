00:36.400 --> 00:40.734
[cheers and applause]

00:40.734 --> 00:43.867
- Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:43.867 --> 00:46.600
I'm John Oliver, thank you
so much for joining us.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.066
Let's dive straight in, and
tonight, we're going to do

00:49.066 --> 00:51.266
something a little bit
different, because for one week

00:51.266 --> 00:54.066
and one week only,
the show "Last Week Tonight"

00:54.066 --> 00:56.400
is actually going to talk
at some length

00:56.400 --> 00:59.767
about the last week, tonight,
and the reason

00:59.767 --> 01:02.467
we unfortunately have to do that
is the last seven days

01:02.467 --> 01:05.967
have been absolutely insane,
so much so that

01:05.967 --> 01:09.333
by Friday night, it may have
broken Anderson Cooper.

01:09.333 --> 01:12.400
Because--I'll tell you why--
because Jeffrey Lord,

01:12.400 --> 01:14.600
CNN contributor and die-hard
Trump supporter,

01:14.600 --> 01:16.867
was in the middle of defending
yet another indefensible

01:16.867 --> 01:20.867
statement from Trump
when Cooper finally snapped.

01:20.867 --> 01:22.433
- He's the president
of the United States.

01:22.433 --> 01:25.333
If he wants to say that, Barack
Obama wants to say whatever,

01:25.333 --> 01:26.834
if George Bush says,
"I looked in his eyes"--

01:26.834 --> 01:29.433
- If he took a dump on his desk,
you would defend it.

01:29.433 --> 01:31.900
- [laughs] What?

01:31.900 --> 01:35.734
- Yes, yes, that is
a professional journalist

01:35.734 --> 01:38.533
saying of the president,
"If he took a dump

01:38.533 --> 01:40.834
on his desk,
you would defend it."

01:40.834 --> 01:43.467
And more importantly,
Jeffrey Lord

01:43.467 --> 01:46.700
did not immediately
answer "No."

01:46.700 --> 01:49.667
And look: on a different night,
I could probably devote time

01:49.667 --> 01:52.367
to why CNN would put themselves
in the position

01:52.367 --> 01:54.533
of having a professional
dump defender

01:54.533 --> 01:56.400
constantly on their network,

01:56.400 --> 01:58.066
but there is not going to be
time, because

01:58.066 --> 02:01.133
tonight we have to track
the latest developments

02:01.133 --> 02:04.166
in what we've been calling
"Stupid Watergate,"

02:04.166 --> 02:07.266
a scandal with all the potential
ramifications of Watergate,

02:07.266 --> 02:11.033
but where everyone involved is
stupid and bad at everything.

02:11.033 --> 02:14.433
And given the exhausting pace
of this week's events, tonight,

02:14.433 --> 02:17.567
we are simply gonna try and
answer a few basic questions.

02:17.567 --> 02:20.200
What the fuck is going on?

02:20.200 --> 02:21.834
How big a deal is this?

02:21.834 --> 02:23.567
Where do we go from here?

02:23.567 --> 02:25.900
And is this real life?

02:25.900 --> 02:28.700
So let's begin
with question one,

02:28.700 --> 02:31.367
what the fuck is going on?

02:31.367 --> 02:34.767
And the answer to that is:
quite a lot.

02:34.767 --> 02:39.200
Can you even remember
how this week began?

02:39.200 --> 02:41.300
'Cause there was actually
a big story on Monday

02:41.300 --> 02:43.500
that you may have
forgotten by now.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.500
- Top secret bombshell:
reports President Trump revealed

02:46.500 --> 02:48.033
highly-classified intelligence

02:48.033 --> 02:49.633
to the Russians
in the Oval Office.

02:49.633 --> 02:51.633
- Sources tell "The Washington
Post" the president

02:51.633 --> 02:53.934
was boasting to Russia's
foreign minister

02:53.934 --> 02:56.367
and ambassador when he divulged
the intelligence

02:56.367 --> 02:58.700
during an Oval Office
meeting last week.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.000
- That's right, President Trump
may have inadvertently

03:01.000 --> 03:03.700
revealed code word information,
one of the highest

03:03.700 --> 03:06.400
levels of classification,
to Russian officials.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.500
And that is the kind of
information you shouldn't even

03:08.500 --> 03:11.233
share with your closest friends,
which, of course,

03:11.233 --> 03:14.100
in Trump's case would be
the golf caddy he calls Steve

03:14.100 --> 03:15.800
even though his name is Doug,

03:15.800 --> 03:18.367
a bucket of KFC chicken,

03:18.367 --> 03:20.567
and the ghost of Roger Ailes.

03:20.567 --> 03:23.600
And--and back then--
back then--

03:23.600 --> 03:26.967
in the more innocent
time of Monday,

03:26.967 --> 03:29.200
it felt like there simply
could not be

03:29.200 --> 03:31.233
a bigger story than that.

03:31.233 --> 03:33.633
- This is the most serious
charge

03:33.633 --> 03:36.133
ever made against
a sitting president.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.600
Let's not minimize it.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.767
Comey is in the wastebaste--
basket of history.

03:41.767 --> 03:44.133
Everything else
is off the table.

03:44.133 --> 03:47.900
This is the most
serious charge ever made against

03:47.900 --> 03:50.333
a sitting president
of the United States.

03:50.333 --> 03:51.834
- Yeah, turns out
Alan Dershowitz

03:51.834 --> 03:54.467
was extremely
wrong about that, and

03:54.467 --> 03:55.967
I would say it's hard
to imagine

03:55.967 --> 03:57.834
him being more wrong
about anything,

03:57.834 --> 04:00.533
but fortunately, we have
photographic proof.

04:00.533 --> 04:03.367
But the point is--
the point is,

04:03.367 --> 04:09.033
that Russia news was buried
the very next day by this.

04:09.033 --> 04:11.100
- ABC News confirming
that shortly after

04:11.100 --> 04:13.367
an Oval Office visit
in February,

04:13.367 --> 04:16.233
former FBI Director
James Comey wrote a memo

04:16.233 --> 04:19.367
saying that during that
meeting, President Trump

04:19.367 --> 04:21.767
asked him to shut down
his investigation

04:21.767 --> 04:24.900
into national security adviser
Michael Flynn.

04:24.900 --> 04:27.633
- And that was a huge deal,
because let me give you

04:27.633 --> 04:29.800
a quick reminder
about why the FBI

04:29.800 --> 04:32.700
was investigating Flynn, a man
whose overall demeanor

04:32.700 --> 04:35.233
says, "I only fuck
on top of the sheets

04:35.233 --> 04:38.233
so I don't ruin
the hospital corners."

04:38.233 --> 04:41.667
Michael Flynn was fired after
it emerged he'd discussed

04:41.667 --> 04:44.633
US sanctions against Russia
with Russian officials

04:44.633 --> 04:48.300
during the transition, despite
denying that to the press,

04:48.300 --> 04:51.567
to the FBI, and to
Vice President Mike Pence.

04:51.567 --> 04:54.600
Flynn was so flawed, team Trump
was repeatedly warned

04:54.600 --> 04:57.934
about his baggage by both
then-acting AG Sally Yates

04:57.934 --> 05:01.333
and President Obama,
and even, as reported this week,

05:01.333 --> 05:03.500
General Flynn himself.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.967
But Trump kept standing by him
anyway, which kind of

05:06.967 --> 05:09.567
makes sense, in a way, because
literally every decision

05:09.567 --> 05:13.233
in the Trump administration
is the worst possible one.

05:13.233 --> 05:14.533
Paper or plastic?

05:14.533 --> 05:16.934
Whichever one kills
the most birds.

05:16.934 --> 05:18.133
Soup or salad?

05:18.133 --> 05:20.700
I'm gonna go with the N-word.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.100
Favorite Beatle?

05:22.100 --> 05:24.233
It's got to be Yoko.

05:24.233 --> 05:28.100
Anyway, let's get back to this
week, because on Wednesday,

05:28.100 --> 05:30.934
just four days ago, which is
the equivalent

05:30.934 --> 05:34.300
of 150 years in 2017 time,

05:34.300 --> 05:36.500
Donald Trump gave
the commencement address

05:36.500 --> 05:38.800
at the Coast Guard Academy,
and that should have been easy.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.700
Simply lift the cadets' spirits

05:40.700 --> 05:42.900
and point them towards
the future, but Trump

05:42.900 --> 05:46.333
inevitably used the speech to--
well, I'm fairly sure

05:46.333 --> 05:48.667
momentarily forget
the word "certainty"

05:48.667 --> 05:51.066
and then also generally
whine about

05:51.066 --> 05:53.100
how mean people were being
to him.

05:53.100 --> 05:56.600
- No politician in history--

05:56.600 --> 06:00.600
and I say this
with great...surety--

06:00.600 --> 06:04.400
has been treated worse
or more unfairly.

06:04.400 --> 06:08.200
- Wait, no politician
has been treated worse?

06:08.200 --> 06:10.900
Abraham Lincoln was shot
by an actor.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.767
William McKinley was shot
by an anarchist.

06:13.767 --> 06:16.767
JFK was of course murdered
by Ted Cruz's father.

06:16.767 --> 06:20.800
And James Garfield was shot,
then to find the bullet--

06:20.800 --> 06:22.967
and this is true--
Alexander Graham Bell

06:22.967 --> 06:25.700
devised a kind of metal detector
which didn't work,

06:25.700 --> 06:27.734
so doctors tried to fish around
in his guts

06:27.734 --> 06:30.033
for the bullet
with unwashed fingers,

06:30.033 --> 06:31.633
which just made
his infection worse,

06:31.633 --> 06:34.133
so he died in horrible pain.

06:34.133 --> 06:37.166
But yeah, Alec Baldwin sometimes
does a mean impression

06:37.166 --> 06:41.266
of you on TV, so yeah, it's
basically the same, isn't it?

06:41.266 --> 06:44.567
Then--then--
later that same day--

06:44.567 --> 06:47.567
the same day,
the Justice Department appointed

06:47.567 --> 06:50.967
a special counsel,
former FBI head Robert Mueller,

06:50.967 --> 06:53.233
to conduct an independent
investigation into

06:53.233 --> 06:55.500
the Trump campaign's connections
to Russia,

06:55.500 --> 06:58.066
which is also
a massive development

06:58.066 --> 07:00.367
that was closely followed
by Thursday's news

07:00.367 --> 07:03.300
concerning James Comey,
specifically his friend's

07:03.300 --> 07:05.166
account of the lengths
to which Comey went

07:05.166 --> 07:07.867
at this post-inauguration
meeting to try and

07:07.867 --> 07:11.033
avoid a personal encounter
with the president.

07:11.033 --> 07:12.967
- He's wearing--if you watch
the video of it,

07:12.967 --> 07:15.900
he's wearing a blue blazer,
and he stands

07:15.900 --> 07:18.266
in the part of the room
that is as far

07:18.266 --> 07:21.166
from Trump as it is physically
possible to be,

07:21.166 --> 07:23.600
and also against blue drapes

07:23.600 --> 07:26.200
that are the same color
as his--

07:26.200 --> 07:28.633
- He chose that spot?
- He chose that spot because

07:28.633 --> 07:32.834
it was, you know, like,
almost like a chameleon.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.900
Or, you know, camouflaged
against the wall.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.233
- Blend in.

07:36.233 --> 07:38.300
- Come on, Comey!

07:38.300 --> 07:42.600
If you're 6'8", you don't hide
by blending into a curtain.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.834
You wear a brown suit, you paste
a few leaves to your

07:44.834 --> 07:47.934
hand and head, and you hope to
be mistaken for a tree.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.800
What's what you do.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.400
Now, luckily, we somehow escaped
Thursday alive,

07:52.400 --> 07:54.300
and on Friday,
the president took off

07:54.300 --> 07:56.700
for a nine-day overseas trip,
but the wheels

07:56.700 --> 07:59.500
of Air Force One
had barely left the ground

07:59.500 --> 08:01.300
when this happened.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.800
- "The New York Times"
now reporting

08:02.800 --> 08:04.400
that according to
a White House document,

08:04.400 --> 08:06.433
President Trump
in the Oval Office

08:06.433 --> 08:08.300
told Russian officials
ten days ago that

08:08.300 --> 08:12.500
James Comey, the FBI director,
was a "nut job."

08:12.500 --> 08:15.266
- Now, yeah, that sounds rough,
but in Trump's defense,

08:15.266 --> 08:17.433
I can kind of see
where he's coming from.

08:17.433 --> 08:20.433
I mean, the guy keeps hiding
in my drapes.

08:20.433 --> 08:24.867
Who does that? He's huge.
I can see him.

08:24.867 --> 08:28.633
Dress like a tree.
You've got to know that.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.333
And--and here's the thing:
that same document,

08:31.333 --> 08:33.934
which the White House
did not deny,

08:33.934 --> 08:35.734
gave the even more
concerning detail

08:35.734 --> 08:37.767
that Trump had told
his Russian guests...

08:43.967 --> 08:45.333
And it's almost difficult

08:45.333 --> 08:47.767
to believe your ears
when you hear something

08:47.767 --> 08:49.867
that sounds
so audaciously corrupt.

08:49.867 --> 08:52.200
It's like if Hillary Clinton
had sent an email

08:52.200 --> 08:55.934
with the subject line,
"Sup, I did Benghazi."

08:55.934 --> 09:01.600
But wait--wait, because the week
still wasn't quite yet done.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.400
'Cause almost at the exact same
time that the "nut job"

09:04.400 --> 09:08.333
news emerged, there was one last
startling revelation.

09:08.333 --> 09:11.066
- "The Washington Post"
began reporting that the FBI

09:11.066 --> 09:13.967
investigation into possible
coordination between Russia

09:13.967 --> 09:16.700
and the Trump campaign
has identified

09:16.700 --> 09:18.934
a current White House official

09:18.934 --> 09:21.834
as a significant
person of interest.

09:21.834 --> 09:24.533
- And that is also
potentially enormous.

09:24.533 --> 09:27.233
Now, some have suggested that
that could be Jared Kushner,

09:27.233 --> 09:29.900
but it seems unlikely, because
while he is technically

09:29.900 --> 09:32.500
significant and legally
a person,

09:32.500 --> 09:37.200
he in no way qualifies
as "of interest."

09:37.200 --> 09:40.834
He is the least interesting
human on Earth.

09:40.834 --> 09:45.633
He is the person equivalent of
an empty room painted eggshell.

09:45.633 --> 09:48.166
He's like a white bread
sandwich where the middle

09:48.166 --> 09:51.166
is just a third slice
of white bread.

09:51.166 --> 09:53.100
Or as Mike Pence
refers to that,

09:53.100 --> 09:54.734
"The devil's hoagie."

09:54.734 --> 09:58.066
So--so that is the shortest
possible summation

09:58.066 --> 09:59.433
of the events of this week,

09:59.433 --> 10:01.200
which brings us
to our second question:

10:01.200 --> 10:03.033
how big a deal is this?

10:03.033 --> 10:06.100
Because it feels like
a pretty big deal.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.066
Think about it: going into this
week, there were already

10:08.066 --> 10:10.133
multiple investigations
into Russia's efforts

10:10.133 --> 10:12.867
to swing the election
and any possible ties

10:12.867 --> 10:15.200
to the Trump campaign,
but there are now

10:15.200 --> 10:18.100
also strong allegations that
Trump attempted, in some form,

10:18.100 --> 10:21.600
to influence the investigations,
and we now have

10:21.600 --> 10:23.834
a special counsel
looking into all of this.

10:23.834 --> 10:25.567
You would almost
have to be trying

10:25.567 --> 10:29.300
really hard not to see this
as a big deal,

10:29.300 --> 10:31.266
and nobody tried harder

10:31.266 --> 10:33.633
than some commentators
on Fox News.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.300
- This is insane--where is the
evidence of a crime?

10:37.300 --> 10:39.934
- People are now buying
some of this lunacy.

10:39.934 --> 10:42.300
- Hysteria every single day.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.066
- We've reached a point
of madness.

10:44.066 --> 10:45.734
- They're unhinged.
- This is a scandal

10:45.734 --> 10:48.834
with no video,
with no audio,

10:48.834 --> 10:52.734
with no sex, with no money,
with no dead bodies.

10:52.734 --> 10:56.567
It's a boring scandal.

10:56.567 --> 10:59.033
- That is just ridiculous.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.700
"There may be Americans hidden
in plain view

11:01.700 --> 11:04.333
working on behalf of Russia"
is not boring,

11:04.333 --> 11:08.667
it's literally a fucking
Emmy-nominated TV show.

11:08.667 --> 11:11.600
But perhaps my favorite attempt

11:11.600 --> 11:15.233
to pour water on this story
came from Tucker Carlson,

11:15.233 --> 11:17.767
the villain from a
direct-to-video "Caddyshack"

11:17.767 --> 11:21.233
sequel who somehow
became a real boy.

11:21.233 --> 11:26.100
Tucks tried to Jedi Mind Trick
this scandal out of existence.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.800
- The world is a very
complicated place,

11:27.800 --> 11:29.400
Washington especially.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.834
What you think is happening
often really isn't happening.

11:32.834 --> 11:37.233
- Wow, what you think is
happening isn't happening.

11:37.233 --> 11:39.233
He's talking to his viewers
like a parent

11:39.233 --> 11:42.433
whose kids just walked in
on them 69-ing.

11:42.433 --> 11:44.266
This isn't what you think!

11:44.266 --> 11:46.166
This isn't what you're
looking at.

11:46.166 --> 11:48.333
Your mother and I were just
listening to see

11:48.333 --> 11:50.900
if there's an echo when
you scream into a butt.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.834
Nothing is happening here.

11:52.834 --> 11:55.967
You're not seeing
anything here.

11:55.967 --> 11:59.133
[laughter, cheers, applause]

11:59.133 --> 12:02.700
Although fascinatingly,
as the week went on,

12:02.700 --> 12:05.700
even some on Fox were struggling
to hold the line,

12:05.700 --> 12:08.266
because remember Mr.
"This is a boring scandal"?

12:08.266 --> 12:11.033
This was him just
two days later.

12:11.033 --> 12:13.233
- I've been the first one
to say, you know,

12:13.233 --> 12:15.333
there's a lot of smoke, but
I don't see any fire,

12:15.333 --> 12:16.834
but now I'm getting
a little concerned.

12:16.834 --> 12:20.000
Even I, myself, have gotten to
the point where I'm like,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.433
what is going on here
with this situation?

12:22.433 --> 12:24.367
I'm a little
worried about it.

12:24.367 --> 12:27.100
- That cannot be a good sign.

12:27.100 --> 12:30.467
A Fox host not being able
to hold his doubts at bay

12:30.467 --> 12:34.567
for 48 hours is pretty much
a canary in a coal mine,

12:34.567 --> 12:36.133
but then, at this point,
Donald Trump

12:36.133 --> 12:39.100
is basically waist-deep
in dead canaries.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.734
And you can tell how serious
this is becoming

12:41.734 --> 12:44.066
by the fact that when the news
started breaking this week,

12:44.066 --> 12:48.200
members of Trump's own party
were suddenly hard to find.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.133
- We reached out to
20 Republican senators

12:50.133 --> 12:52.266
and representatives to appear
on this broadcast.

12:52.266 --> 12:54.800
We also reported and requested
that someone

12:54.800 --> 12:57.066
from the White House join us
at any point

12:57.066 --> 13:00.266
during our two-hour broadcast
to respond to the latest news.

13:00.266 --> 13:02.700
All declined our invitation.

13:02.700 --> 13:05.367
- Now, just try and think about
how crazy that is.

13:05.367 --> 13:08.166
20 invites, 20 refusals.

13:08.166 --> 13:10.200
That's worse attendance
than a wrap party

13:10.200 --> 13:12.000
for the cast of "The Jinx."

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't know, Bob, where do you
think everyone is,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.533
you massive creep.

13:18.533 --> 13:22.667
Now--now some Republicans did
comment on Trump this week,

13:22.667 --> 13:24.233
but not perhaps in the way that

13:24.233 --> 13:26.033
the White House would have
ideally wanted.

13:26.033 --> 13:29.066
For example, John McCain
had this to say.

13:29.066 --> 13:31.200
- I think it's reaching
the point where

13:31.200 --> 13:34.934
it's of Watergate
size and scale, and a couple

13:34.934 --> 13:38.000
of other scandals that
you and I have seen.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.600
It's a centipede, and the shoe
continues to drop.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.667
- Yeah, it's like a centipede
that keeps dropping shoes,

13:44.667 --> 13:47.367
but it's real,
and people wear shoes,

13:47.367 --> 13:49.533
so the Trump administration
is really more like

13:49.533 --> 13:52.166
a human centipede
in terms of the amount

13:52.166 --> 13:53.600
of shit passing through it

13:53.600 --> 13:56.667
and how nauseating watching it
really is.

13:56.667 --> 13:59.633
And while McCain was willing
to cite Watergate,

13:59.633 --> 14:02.700
other Republicans were willing
to go even further.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.400
- Michigan's Justin Amash
today became the first

14:05.400 --> 14:07.600
Republican to say
the president's actions

14:07.600 --> 14:09.433
might merit impeachment.

14:09.433 --> 14:12.700
- And there we have it: a member
of Trump's own party

14:12.700 --> 14:14.266
has raised the specter
of impeachment

14:14.266 --> 14:17.767
just four months into
the president's first term.

14:17.767 --> 14:20.633
That is almost impressive,
in a way,

14:20.633 --> 14:23.200
and it gets worse,
because when "Mother Jones"

14:23.200 --> 14:24.734
ran an article citing Amash

14:24.734 --> 14:27.166
as the first Republican
to mention impeachment,

14:27.166 --> 14:29.767
a spokeswoman for
another Republican,

14:29.767 --> 14:32.467
Representative Carlos Curbelo
of Florida,

14:32.467 --> 14:35.066
reached out to say
he was actually

14:35.066 --> 14:38.100
the first Republican
to mention it.

14:38.100 --> 14:42.767
Although to be fair--
to be completely fair here,

14:42.767 --> 14:44.767
the very first person to think,

14:44.767 --> 14:47.100
"Oh, God, he should not
be president,"

14:47.100 --> 14:48.834
is probably some unnamed nurse

14:48.834 --> 14:52.367
in Queens in the year 1946.

14:52.367 --> 14:54.633
You know, I've been doing this
a long time,

14:54.633 --> 14:58.767
but this baby is the worst one
I've ever seen.

14:58.767 --> 15:01.533
This is a terrible baby.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.667
And the specter of impeachment
is something

15:03.667 --> 15:07.233
that some in the White House are
reportedly taking seriously.

15:07.233 --> 15:09.433
- And after days of
incendiary headlines,

15:09.433 --> 15:11.467
CNN has learned that
White House lawyers

15:11.467 --> 15:13.233
are researching
what a possible

15:13.233 --> 15:15.633
Trump impeachment
might look like.

15:15.633 --> 15:17.233
- That's actually
a pretty good question.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.467
What would a Trump impeachment
look like?

15:19.467 --> 15:22.333
I mean, ironically, I imagine at
least part of it would involve

15:22.333 --> 15:25.100
thousands of Muslims
celebrating in New Jersey.

15:25.100 --> 15:29.433
So--so this--
this certainly has

15:29.433 --> 15:33.333
all the appearances
of a pretty big deal,

15:33.333 --> 15:35.200
which brings us
to question number three:

15:35.200 --> 15:37.166
where do we go from here?

15:37.166 --> 15:39.066
And if you are hoping for
an impeachment

15:39.066 --> 15:41.567
or a resignation, it is worth
taking a quick peek

15:41.567 --> 15:43.367
at the presidential
line of succession,

15:43.367 --> 15:45.066
because Trump going
would be fantastic,

15:45.066 --> 15:48.333
but remember that would give us
President Mike Pence,

15:48.333 --> 15:50.500
and let me remind you
how our prospective

15:50.500 --> 15:52.667
next president sees himself.

15:52.667 --> 15:54.900
- I'm a Christian,
a conservative,

15:54.900 --> 15:57.233
and a Republican,
in that order.

15:57.233 --> 15:58.900
I'm a Christian,
a conservative,

15:58.900 --> 16:00.667
and a Republican,
in that order.

16:00.667 --> 16:02.200
I'm a Christian--
a conservative--

16:02.200 --> 16:04.433
and a Republican--
in that order.

16:04.433 --> 16:05.867
- Honestly, I would have loved
it if he'd just

16:05.867 --> 16:08.033
kept going after--
"After those three,

16:08.033 --> 16:09.667
"I'm a Gemini, I'm a furry,

16:09.667 --> 16:11.667
"and I'm gluten intolerant,
in that order.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.834
"That's what I am,
those six things,

16:13.834 --> 16:15.934
don't get it wrong."

16:15.934 --> 16:18.767
Mike Pence is a hard-line
conservative.

16:18.767 --> 16:21.233
In Congress, he led efforts to
defund Planned Parenthood.

16:21.233 --> 16:23.700
He opposed the Lilly Ledbetter
Act and the ending

16:23.700 --> 16:25.900
of "Don't ask, don't tell,"
and championed

16:25.900 --> 16:28.033
a Constitutional amendment
defining marriage

16:28.033 --> 16:29.567
as between a man
and a woman,

16:29.567 --> 16:31.133
and as governor of Indiana,

16:31.133 --> 16:32.867
his most eye-catching
accomplishment was

16:32.867 --> 16:35.600
the passage of the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act,

16:35.600 --> 16:37.934
which could have made it easier
for religious conservatives

16:37.934 --> 16:40.233
to refuse service
to gay couples.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.400
And making matters worse, when
he was asked multiple times

16:43.400 --> 16:45.033
whether that's what it did,

16:45.033 --> 16:48.767
he kept dodging the question,
ending in this exchange.

16:48.767 --> 16:50.600
- Do you think
it should be legal

16:50.600 --> 16:52.333
in the state of Indiana

16:52.333 --> 16:56.000
to discriminate against
gays or lesbians?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.700
- George...[sighs]
- It's a yes or no question.

16:58.700 --> 17:03.200
- Hoosiers--come on, Hoosiers
don't believe in discrimination.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.300
- Yeah, well, I don't
believe in Hoosiers.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.633
What the fuck is a Hoosier?

17:08.633 --> 17:11.467
Where does that term
come from anyway?

17:11.467 --> 17:15.467
It sounds like the sound
Al Pacino makes when he sneezes.

17:15.467 --> 17:18.900
Hoosier!
Hoosier!

17:18.900 --> 17:23.533
Hoosier!
Whoo!

17:23.533 --> 17:26.033
And by the way,
if you're telling yourself,

17:26.033 --> 17:29.133
"Well, maybe Trump's impeachment
could take Pence down as well,"

17:29.133 --> 17:31.000
well, think about what
that would mean, because

17:31.000 --> 17:33.100
then we'd have
President Paul Ryan,

17:33.100 --> 17:35.367
three words that I always knew
I'd have to say,

17:35.367 --> 17:37.000
but I didn't really expect

17:37.000 --> 17:38.600
to have to say it
quite so soon,

17:38.600 --> 17:40.734
Sort of like,
"Remember polar bears?"

17:40.734 --> 17:43.400
Or "Female 'Entourage' reboot."

17:43.400 --> 17:46.800
The boys are back,
and this time, they're girls.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.166
And you know, if you really want
to spin this fantasy out,

17:49.166 --> 17:51.166
let's say that Ryan is also
somehow sitting

17:51.166 --> 17:52.900
on his own impeachable
clusterfuck.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.467
Do you know who is next in line
to the presidency?

17:55.467 --> 17:57.066
You might not.

17:57.066 --> 17:59.000
I'm not sure that you do,
do you?

17:59.000 --> 18:03.266
It's actually
Mr. Kelsey Grammer.

18:03.266 --> 18:06.200
And you're probably assuming
correctly that that is wrong,

18:06.200 --> 18:08.500
but what is the real
right answer there?

18:08.500 --> 18:11.100
I can actually tell you, because
we would genuinely have

18:11.100 --> 18:13.700
President Orrin Hatch
at that point.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.367
Yes, he would be--
he would be president.

18:16.367 --> 18:18.600
A man whose every
expression says,

18:18.600 --> 18:20.100
"I take fiber supplements,

18:20.100 --> 18:23.100
and frankly,
they're not working."

18:23.100 --> 18:27.200
And look, Hatch is his own
separate kind of nightmare,

18:27.200 --> 18:29.233
but before we get lost
any further down this

18:29.233 --> 18:32.400
paranoid wormhole, let's just
all take a collective breath,

18:32.400 --> 18:35.300
because in reality,
even though some people

18:35.300 --> 18:37.033
have been getting
excited this week,

18:37.033 --> 18:40.600
impeachment is a long shot
for many reasons,

18:40.600 --> 18:43.300
not the least of which is,
it would require a majority

18:43.300 --> 18:45.000
of the House
to vote to impeach,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.166
and that is currently controlled
by Republicans,

18:47.166 --> 18:49.333
and then it would then need
two-thirds

18:49.333 --> 18:52.000
of the Senate to vote
to convict the president,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.100
and it is also controlled by
Republicans right now,

18:55.100 --> 18:58.100
so the likelihood is that Trump
will survive this

18:58.100 --> 18:59.467
and continue as president,

18:59.467 --> 19:02.100
which shouldn't really be
a surprise to anyone.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.867
Why would this be the end
of the line for him?

19:04.867 --> 19:06.533
Trump has seemed to reach
the end of the line

19:06.533 --> 19:09.533
on multiple occasions,
only for nothing to happen.

19:09.533 --> 19:12.900
Remember when he hesitated to
disavow David Duke?

19:12.900 --> 19:15.233
Wasn't that supposed to be
the end of the line?

19:15.233 --> 19:17.600
Or the time he bullied
a Gold Star family?

19:17.600 --> 19:19.734
That had to be the end
of the line, right?

19:19.734 --> 19:21.266
Or the "Access Hollywood" tape?

19:21.266 --> 19:24.066
We all thought the next stop
on that bus was,

19:24.066 --> 19:26.967
you guessed it,
the end of the fucking line,

19:26.967 --> 19:29.367
But it seems like when it comes
to President Trump,

19:29.367 --> 19:31.467
he's always approaching
the end of the line,

19:31.467 --> 19:34.233
but it never seems to come,
as if for him, and him alone,

19:34.233 --> 19:38.000
the end of the line is drawn
by M.C. fucking Escher.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.600
And--and I know--
I know--

19:41.600 --> 19:43.900
following Stupid Watergate's

19:43.900 --> 19:46.266
every development
can be all-consuming.

19:46.266 --> 19:48.200
It feels like
nothing else has happened

19:48.200 --> 19:50.500
over the last couple of weeks,
but that is

19:50.500 --> 19:53.834
a dangerous thing to believe,
because it has.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.433
Things have happened.

19:55.433 --> 19:57.834
This administration has made
significant moves

19:57.834 --> 19:59.533
that have escaped
many people's attention.

19:59.533 --> 20:02.233
Jeff Sessions moved to lengthen
drug sentences,

20:02.233 --> 20:04.633
undoing Obama-era
criminal justice reforms.

20:04.633 --> 20:07.367
Just tonight it came out that
Trump is going to propose

20:07.367 --> 20:10.600
slashing Medicaid and other
safety-net benefits,

20:10.600 --> 20:13.600
and tomorrow, in court,
the administration may decide

20:13.600 --> 20:17.033
to end key Obamacare subsidies,
which, if that happens,

20:17.033 --> 20:20.767
could immediately unravel
the Obamacare insurance markets.

20:20.767 --> 20:23.934
So that 1946 nurse
was absolutely right.

20:23.934 --> 20:26.266
He was the worst baby,

20:26.266 --> 20:29.834
and you know, he's still
the worst baby now.

20:29.834 --> 20:32.133
And as if all of this
wasn't bad enough,

20:32.133 --> 20:36.367
which is comfortably is, we are
getting some heartbreaking

20:36.367 --> 20:38.367
glimpses into how
this president operates.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.367
For instance, just this week,
again,

20:40.367 --> 20:44.000
we learned that this is how his
own national security team

20:44.000 --> 20:47.533
feels they have to brief him
on important global issues.

20:47.533 --> 20:50.633
- He likes single-page memos
and visual aids like maps,

20:50.633 --> 20:52.367
charts, graphs, and photos.

20:52.367 --> 20:55.266
National security officials
have strategically included

20:55.266 --> 20:58.467
Trump's name in
"As many paragraphs as we can

20:58.467 --> 21:02.900
because he keeps reading
if he is mentioned."

21:02.900 --> 21:07.333
- Wow, that is
absolutely pathetic.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.767
Our president can only
understand the world

21:09.767 --> 21:12.033
to the extent that it involves
himself, meaning

21:12.033 --> 21:15.400
it is entirely possible that
his security briefing reads...

21:31.266 --> 21:36.066
This can all seem like
a terrible work of fiction,

21:36.066 --> 21:38.633
which actually brings us
to our final question:

21:38.633 --> 21:40.734
is this real life?

21:40.734 --> 21:43.233
To which the answer is,
unfortunately, yes.

21:43.233 --> 21:45.800
And if you are feeling miserable
about the situation

21:45.800 --> 21:48.867
that we're in right now, the
only consolation I may be able

21:48.867 --> 21:51.033
to offer you is,
I'm not sure that Trump

21:51.033 --> 21:53.100
is entirely happy either,
because yes,

21:53.100 --> 21:55.533
you've seen him enjoy
the rallies, and the attention,

21:55.533 --> 21:57.667
and the fact that he can say
he's the president,

21:57.667 --> 21:58.867
but I think the most telling

21:58.867 --> 22:01.567
photo taken of him so far
is this one.

22:01.567 --> 22:05.567
That was taken
on his inauguration day

22:05.567 --> 22:08.166
at a luncheon thrown
in his honor.

22:08.166 --> 22:09.967
Look at his face!

22:09.967 --> 22:13.800
He looks like he's at
the funeral for every dog.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.533
And if you think
I'm projecting this onto him,

22:16.533 --> 22:19.266
just listen to an interview
that Trump himself gave

22:19.266 --> 22:21.367
around the hundred-day mark
of his presidency,

22:21.367 --> 22:23.867
and tell me if this is a guy
who sounds like

22:23.867 --> 22:25.900
he's happy with his situation.

22:39.133 --> 22:42.467
- Yes, of course being president

22:42.467 --> 22:45.633
is harder than your old job.
Of course it is.

22:45.633 --> 22:48.467
Your old job was basically
having a name,

22:48.467 --> 22:51.033
letting other people pay you
to use that name,

22:51.033 --> 22:53.367
and firing Dee Snider.

22:53.367 --> 22:55.633
It was fucking easy!

22:55.633 --> 22:57.233
Although, I will say this:

22:57.233 --> 22:59.500
I now actually have something
in common with Donald Trump,

22:59.500 --> 23:02.166
because I too
preferred my previous life

23:02.166 --> 23:05.166
before he became president.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.967
And that is why--
that is why

23:07.967 --> 23:11.233
this is truly Stupid Watergate,

23:11.233 --> 23:13.567
because no matter what,
we are in for

23:13.567 --> 23:15.767
an agonizingly long period
of leaks,

23:15.767 --> 23:18.133
allegations,
and recriminations,

23:18.133 --> 23:21.100
all over a presidential campaign
to put a man in power

23:21.100 --> 23:23.266
who may not entirely
want to be there.

23:23.266 --> 23:25.300
Say what you want about Nixon,

23:25.300 --> 23:27.867
at least he wanted
the fucking job.

23:27.867 --> 23:29.734
Look, I don't know about you,

23:29.734 --> 23:31.867
but this week has drained me.

23:31.867 --> 23:34.767
At the end of last year,
we told you to write down,

23:34.767 --> 23:37.033
"This is not normal,"
to guard yourself

23:37.033 --> 23:38.567
against getting complacent.

23:38.567 --> 23:40.600
I don't think
there is much danger

23:40.600 --> 23:42.767
of that happening
in the foreseeable future,

23:42.767 --> 23:45.734
but it is also worth remembering
that sentiment

23:45.734 --> 23:48.767
just to reassure yourself that
you're not going crazy.

23:48.767 --> 23:51.066
And if you are tempted to
believe any of what people

23:51.066 --> 23:52.533
are saying,
that this is all politics,

23:52.533 --> 23:54.433
and every president
goes through a week

23:54.433 --> 23:57.300
like the one that we just had
early in their administration,

23:57.300 --> 23:59.200
let me show you
one of the things that people

23:59.200 --> 24:00.767
were attacking
the last president for

24:00.767 --> 24:03.633
at roughly the same point
in his first term.

24:03.633 --> 24:05.000
- As you all know,
President Obama

24:05.000 --> 24:06.433
is a real man of the people.

24:06.433 --> 24:08.567
Take a look at him
ordering his burger

24:08.567 --> 24:10.467
with a very
special condiment.

24:10.467 --> 24:12.700
- You got like a spicy mustard
or something like that?

24:12.700 --> 24:14.233
Or a Dijon mustard,
something like that?

24:14.233 --> 24:17.900
- I hope you enjoyed that fancy
burger, Mr. President.

24:17.900 --> 24:20.467
- They were really
mad about that.

24:20.467 --> 24:22.767
That was on actual television.

24:22.767 --> 24:25.734
And I would honestly give
anything to once again live

24:25.734 --> 24:28.633
in a time where the scandal
rocking the executive branch

24:28.633 --> 24:30.834
was a Fox News host implying

24:30.834 --> 24:33.567
that the president likes
metrosexual mustard,

24:33.567 --> 24:36.333
and maybe, fingers crossed,
one day,

24:36.333 --> 24:38.333
we can all get there again.

24:38.333 --> 24:40.266
And now, this.

25:12.767 --> 25:14.967
- Tonight on CBS 2 News
at 11:00.

25:14.967 --> 25:17.867
While you're sleeping,
these kids are playing.

25:17.867 --> 25:19.900
Why? Tonight at 11:00.

25:21.734 --> 25:23.400
- Moving on tonight:
now, before we go,

25:23.400 --> 25:25.700
we have a bit of a problem.
You may have noticed

25:25.700 --> 25:28.133
that Trump has completely
decimated this week,

25:28.133 --> 25:29.734
and unfortunately,
in doing that,

25:29.734 --> 25:31.934
he's essentially destroyed
our plans for this show,

25:31.934 --> 25:34.166
because we wanted to give you
one of our usual

25:34.166 --> 25:36.834
deep dives into
an extremely boring topic.

25:36.834 --> 25:39.567
We'd chosen the TSA,
and there is clearly

25:39.567 --> 25:42.467
not enough time left
for me to do it properly,

25:42.467 --> 25:44.967
but I will not be defeated,

25:44.967 --> 25:47.567
so I'm gonna give you a full
"Last Week Tonight" story

25:47.567 --> 25:50.700
that should take 20 minutes
in just 3 minutes.

25:50.700 --> 25:52.667
Are you ready for this?
[cheering]

25:52.667 --> 25:54.800
There's no time.
There is no time for that.

25:54.800 --> 25:58.033
Let's go: our main story tonight
concerns the TSA,

25:58.033 --> 26:00.166
the only people who worry more
about what's stuck up

26:00.166 --> 26:01.967
your butt than you do.

26:01.967 --> 26:04.066
Long story short, there are
problems, and there are

26:04.066 --> 26:05.667
potential solutions,
and it's more complicated

26:05.667 --> 26:07.834
than you might think.
This graph goes up.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.266
This graph goes down.

26:09.266 --> 26:11.533
In combination,
that's clearly a real problem.

26:11.533 --> 26:13.266
Then, I was gonna show you
this woman, who believes

26:13.266 --> 26:16.033
some TSA techniques are
an invasion of her privacy.

26:16.033 --> 26:18.166
- I think it's an invasion
of my privacy.

26:18.166 --> 26:20.266
- That's not how that word
is pronounced.

26:20.266 --> 26:22.233
Then I was gonna show you
a couple of victims

26:22.233 --> 26:24.467
of inappropriate TSA conduct,
and then to lighten the mood,

26:24.467 --> 26:27.433
I was gonna hit you with a clip
involving Muppet penguins.

26:27.433 --> 26:29.367
- ♪ One, two, three, four ♪

26:29.367 --> 26:31.734
♪ Penguins appear by the door ♪

26:31.734 --> 26:33.200
- Believe me, that actually
made sense

26:33.200 --> 26:35.433
in the context of our piece.

26:35.433 --> 26:37.600
Broadly speaking, penguins
are a flightless bird,

26:37.600 --> 26:39.233
so in theory, if they wanted
to go somewhere,

26:39.233 --> 26:40.734
they might have to deal
with the TSA.

26:40.734 --> 26:43.934
You can imagine the kind of fun
graphics we had planned.

26:43.934 --> 26:45.800
Here's one of Trump
with a penguin.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.967
I was also going to try and
break down TSA procedures

26:48.967 --> 26:50.333
using this clip.

26:50.333 --> 26:52.300
- Sensitive areas
like the breasts,

26:52.300 --> 26:53.800
groin, and buttocks.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.000
- All three of those things are
objectively funny,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.867
but--but we would be placing
them next to a story

26:58.867 --> 27:00.734
where that clip
would actually be sad.

27:00.734 --> 27:03.300
So, how long we got?
90 seconds? Oh, shit.

27:03.300 --> 27:06.533
Okay, we're gonna skip this
clip, this clip, and this clip.

27:06.533 --> 27:08.467
That woman there
is the TSA chief.

27:08.467 --> 27:09.867
No time to get into
what she's saying there

27:09.867 --> 27:11.967
and how it may affect you,
but just enough time

27:11.967 --> 27:13.667
to show you this graphic
of Vladimir Putin

27:13.667 --> 27:16.700
and Boris Yeltsin
giving each other hand jobs.

27:16.700 --> 27:19.867
It would have made
some sense in context.

27:19.867 --> 27:22.533
We also has this
TSA cartoon for you.

27:22.533 --> 27:25.633
- It looks kind of scary.
- No time for a joke there.

27:25.633 --> 27:28.533
Uh, uh, we were also going to
spend a decent amount of time

27:28.533 --> 27:30.834
with the TSA's official
Instagram account.

27:30.834 --> 27:33.533
Here is an actual picture
where someone asked them,

27:33.533 --> 27:35.767
"Are knife-nanas allowed?"

27:35.767 --> 27:38.600
I mean, come on.
Knife-nanas?

27:38.600 --> 27:42.400
We're not supposed to make
a joke about knife-nanas?

27:42.400 --> 27:44.400
We also don't have time
for this graph.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.767
I don't have time
for this graph.

27:45.767 --> 27:47.433
And this graph is actually
a bigger problem

27:47.433 --> 27:49.633
than you might think,
but we have to move past it,

27:49.633 --> 27:51.934
and this is the part where
I have to say, "To be fair,"

27:51.934 --> 27:54.533
and read what the TSA has said
about an incident

27:54.533 --> 27:56.533
that I was going to mention
earlier, and to be fair,

27:56.533 --> 27:59.500
they say, "We conducted
a thorough review"--

27:59.500 --> 28:01.033
and you know what, I don't have
time for this either.

28:01.033 --> 28:04.567
Then I was going to say 48%,
41 out of 50 states,

28:04.567 --> 28:06.934
$4.8 billion dollars
and $9,000,

28:06.934 --> 28:08.900
which I know doesn't sound like
a lot, but it actually is,

28:08.900 --> 28:10.533
and to show you how much,
we were gonna use

28:10.533 --> 28:12.734
the GDP of Moldova--
20 seconds left--

28:12.734 --> 28:15.233
okay, here's three pull quotes,
all of which are important,

28:15.233 --> 28:17.533
the second of which involves
20 tons of cocaine.

28:17.533 --> 28:20.000
Here's an elephant
snorting cocaine.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.700
And here is where I was gonna
reach my conclusion,

28:21.700 --> 28:23.567
which we absolutely do not
have time for,

28:23.567 --> 28:26.100
and then, just to cheer everyone
up at the end of a long

28:26.100 --> 28:28.400
and sporadically depressing
show, we were gonna give you

28:28.400 --> 28:30.233
something joyful
and fun to watch,

28:30.233 --> 28:32.867
and it was the penguins!
We had these penguins!

28:32.867 --> 28:35.667
The penguins were gonna
cheer us up.

28:35.667 --> 28:38.200
And I guess they still can.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.166
Look, penguins!

28:40.166 --> 28:43.400
It's just nice.
That's all it is.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.266
Things are allowed to be nice.

28:45.266 --> 28:47.734
The point is,
write your congressman

28:47.734 --> 28:49.500
about the issues you've seen
discussed tonight.

28:49.500 --> 28:52.066
Can you do that thing where
you laugh with your mouths?

28:52.066 --> 28:53.834
[penguins laughing]
I love that!

28:53.834 --> 28:56.066
That's one of my favorite
things in the world.

28:56.066 --> 28:58.934
Enjoy it.
Enjoy it now and forever.

28:58.934 --> 29:01.233
That's our show--we're off next
week for Memorial Day.

29:01.233 --> 29:02.800
We're back on June 4th.
Thank you for watching.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.266
Good night.
Penguins!

29:05.266 --> 29:07.767
We got penguins!

29:07.767 --> 29:10.767
[penguins honking]

29:10.767 --> 29:13.800
[cheers and applause]

29:16.266 --> 29:19.300
[all honking]

29:26.400 --> 29:28.333
Penguins.
Penguins!

29:28.333 --> 29:30.967
Penguins!
It's penguins!

29:30.967 --> 29:33.000
It's just fun!

29:33.000 --> 29:34.967
It's just some fun!

29:34.967 --> 29:36.967
[cheers and applause]

29:36.967 --> 29:39.000
[bright tone]
