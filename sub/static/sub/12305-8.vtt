WEBVTT

00:15.500 --> 00:16.400
Knock it off.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.700
Excuse me. Could you take
a photo for us please?

00:20.300 --> 00:21.600
Just press that black
button right there.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.800
This is a vacation to die for.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.200
And it's officially over, okay?

00:28.300 --> 00:29.900
We got to get to the airport now.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.700
Can't we stay one more day?

00:31.800 --> 00:33.400
No, we can't stay one more minute, okay?

00:33.435 --> 00:34.800
I have to get back up north.

00:34.900 --> 00:35.500
And if we don't get in the car

00:35.600 --> 00:38.500
in exactly five minutes,
we're going to miss our flight.

00:38.535 --> 00:39.700
Okay, okay, let's divide and conquer.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.500
I'll check on the bags.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.100
I'll bring the car up. I'll make
sure we didn't forget anything.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.600
Guys, let's go. I am going
to go to the washroom-

00:45.700 --> 00:47.200
we're already checked out
- and then we'll meet out front.

00:47.235 --> 00:48.700
Okay, everybody go.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.800
It's just you and me.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.200
ia Do we have an I.D., Miss Boa Vista?

03:43.900 --> 03:45.900
Yeah. PD says it's Brian Partney.

03:45.935 --> 03:46.900
18 years old.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.200
What about a family?

03:49.400 --> 03:50.500
Parents and a brother.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.300
They're Canadian tourists.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.300
Not everybody's going home though.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.500
Doesn't look that way, does it?

03:58.600 --> 03:59.600
The entrance wound says he was shot

03:59.700 --> 04:01.000
facing forward.

04:01.900 --> 04:04.600
Okay, so that means the
killer was facing him.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.100
Miss Boa Vista?

04:12.300 --> 04:13.700
Are you okay?

04:17.700 --> 04:19.500
I've never been first
on the scene before.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.500
You know, without Alexx.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.700
Just... It's weird.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.100
I feel like he was
trying to talk to me-

04:27.135 --> 04:28.700
trying to tell me what happened.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.600
He is trying to talk to
us, and we... are listening.

05:23.270 --> 05:24.170
Morning.

05:30.210 --> 05:33.010
Oh, Alexx, you got a COD yet?

05:33.510 --> 05:36.010
Single shot to the face,
through and through.

05:36.610 --> 05:38.810
Poor thing
- he was dead before he even hit the floor.

05:39.710 --> 05:42.110
Exit wound was below the skulline.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.110
Soft tissue, so the
bullet will be pristine.

05:46.145 --> 05:47.310
I can get that to the lab.

05:47.510 --> 05:49.210
Only one prob What?

05:49.510 --> 05:51.110
It's not here.

05:51.710 --> 05:52.610
Really?

05:53.010 --> 05:54.310
But he did leave this.

05:54.810 --> 05:58.110
Looks like some kind
of gang paraphernalia.

05:58.210 --> 06:01.010
Black is the signature
color of the Cobra Familia.

06:02.910 --> 06:04.610
Gang hit.

06:04.710 --> 06:06.610
On a tourist from Canada.

06:11.810 --> 06:14.610
Well, look at that.

06:15.310 --> 06:16.810
I'm on YouTube.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.510
Some sort of closed-circuit
recording device.

06:20.110 --> 06:21.610
Hopefully it caught the murder.

06:22.410 --> 06:24.110
Well, you know what, I
may not have the bullet,

06:24.210 --> 06:26.110
but you can sure bet I'm going
to take that camera to the lab.

06:34.010 --> 06:35.810
How you holding up, Mr. Partney?

06:38.610 --> 06:41.210
Your son was on the
elevator. Where was he going?

06:44.210 --> 06:45.410
I have no idea.

06:46.410 --> 06:48.310
We were checking out.
We were all in a hurry.

06:48.710 --> 06:50.510
Did he make any contacts down here?

06:52.310 --> 06:53.310
Contacts?

06:54.010 --> 06:56.410
We... we were just all
having fun together.

06:58.010 --> 07:00.310
Is it possib, Mr. Partney,

07:00.410 --> 07:02.110
that this is gang related?

07:04.110 --> 07:05.310
Gang related?

07:05.710 --> 07:07.760
Are you suggesting that
my son was in a gang?

07:07.795 --> 07:09.810
Mr. Partney, I'm just
asking you a question.

07:10.610 --> 07:13.910
This hotel is supposed
to be a celebrity hangout.

07:14.210 --> 07:15.110
Rap stars,

07:15.210 --> 07:16.110
starlets.

07:16.210 --> 07:17.710
We thought it would be fun.

07:19.010 --> 07:20.210
Should have stayed home.

07:20.910 --> 07:21.510
The young man

07:21.610 --> 07:22.710
that is standing there

07:22.810 --> 07:24.610
with your wife
- who's that?

07:27.510 --> 07:28.710
That's my other son Shane.

07:32.810 --> 07:35.210
Shane idolized Brian.

07:36.510 --> 07:38.210
Never seen two brothers closer.

07:42.610 --> 07:44.310
My heart...

07:44.610 --> 07:46.210
is torn out, Lieutenant.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.010
How are you going to make that right?

07:52.010 --> 07:53.810
I'm going to find your son's killer.

08:15.710 --> 08:18.610
The bandana we found in the elevator

08:18.810 --> 08:20.710
I guess we're back to square one.

08:20.910 --> 08:23.010
And what about Brian
Partney's clothes, anything?

08:23.310 --> 08:24.710
The bloodstains are consistent

08:24.810 --> 08:27.010
with the type of wound
and the body position.

08:38.710 --> 08:40.409
That's an Alon key card.

08:40.909 --> 08:42.710
Yeah, well, they gave us
access to guest records,

08:42.809 --> 08:43.909
so Partney's information

08:44.010 --> 08:45.210
should still be on it.

08:53.110 --> 08:55.410
Except that's not the key
from the Partneys' room.

08:55.445 --> 08:57.010
They were in room 423.

08:57.610 --> 08:58.610
Well, room 804.

08:58.710 --> 08:59.810
It's Mitch Pena.

08:59.910 --> 09:01.710
Looks like the eighth
floor of that hotel

09:01.810 --> 09:03.210
is worth a visit.

09:17.910 --> 09:19.410
Got blood specks.

09:20.110 --> 09:21.810
It's consistent with blowback spatter.

09:22.210 --> 09:23.910
So this is where Brian got shot.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.410
Room 804 has got a
straight line of sight

09:39.510 --> 09:40.910
to this elevator.

09:41.010 --> 09:43.810
Yep. Let's got talk to Pena about that.

09:44.310 --> 09:45.310
All right.

09:47.110 --> 09:48.910
<i>The victim's name me was Brian Partney.</i>

09:50.110 --> 09:51.210
Did you know him?

09:54.410 --> 09:55.910
We heard about the kid.

09:57.410 --> 09:59.210
But I'm not sure how we can help you.

09:59.910 --> 10:01.410
He was shot 12 feet from your door

10:01.510 --> 10:02.710
and you didn't hear anything?

10:04.010 --> 10:05.510
We hit the beach early.

10:06.210 --> 10:06.910
It's the reason

10:07.010 --> 10:08.610
why we came down here from New York.

10:12.810 --> 10:16.510
Anyways, I'm not the one you
should be talking to about him.

10:19.910 --> 10:20.910
Amy.

10:26.010 --> 10:28.410
I just... can't believe he's dead.

10:29.610 --> 10:30.810
So you knew him

10:31.810 --> 10:34.510
I met Brian downstairs
yesterday, you know?

10:36.910 --> 10:38.710
A few too many mojitos, and...

10:39.810 --> 10:40.710
He was nice.

10:41.410 --> 10:42.310
You gave that punk

10:42.410 --> 10:43.410
your room key.

10:49.710 --> 10:50.710
Hey.

10:51.010 --> 10:52.010
Sorry.

10:52.310 --> 10:53.610
You okay? Thanks.

11:03.610 --> 11:04.410
Hey.

11:07.910 --> 11:10.010
If you want to hang
out, I'm in room 804.

11:16.610 --> 11:18.410
He ever get a chance to use the key?

11:20.610 --> 11:22.910
Yeah, we hung out a
little while after that.

11:36.010 --> 11:37.010
What the hell is this?

11:37.110 --> 11:38.010
What do you think you're
doing you little punk?

11:38.045 --> 11:39.910
This is my room. This is my girl.

11:40.010 --> 11:40.810
Just leave him alone.

11:43.010 --> 11:44.160
We were just talking,
okay? Oh, he's okay.

11:44.195 --> 11:45.310
You trying to make me
jealous? No, no, no,

11:46.610 --> 11:47.810
He was harmless.

11:48.010 --> 11:49.210
We didn't do anything.

11:49.610 --> 11:50.810
I threw the punk out.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.510
He ran like a little bitch.

11:52.610 --> 11:54.410
You chase him down
with a gun and kill him?

11:56.110 --> 11:57.410
Now, why would I do that?

11:57.510 --> 11:59.410
Jealousy is a powerful motive.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.010
That's great.

12:03.310 --> 12:04.710
She cheats on me...

12:06.110 --> 12:08.910
and I end up with a murder rap. Not yet.

12:09.310 --> 12:11.710
But don't plan on going back
to New York any time soon.

12:12.310 --> 12:13.510
We'll be talking again.

12:31.010 --> 12:32.210
Take a look at this.

12:37.410 --> 12:38.310
Wow.

12:38.710 --> 12:40.210
Is this from the camera
in the elevator? Yeah.

12:40.310 --> 12:42.410
This is the footage from
right before the murder.

12:44.010 --> 12:44.910
Look at that.

12:45.110 --> 12:46.510
From bedroom to coffin.

12:48.010 --> 12:50.410
Poor kid never even saw
what was coming. I know.

12:52.410 --> 12:53.510
Oh.

12:55.610 --> 12:56.910
You see that? Yeah.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.210
Killer never even entered the elevator.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.110
Yeah, let me take it right back.

12:59.210 --> 13:00.210
I'm gonna take it back

13:00.245 --> 13:01.210
to the muzzle flash.

13:04.310 --> 13:05.810
See it? Yeah, I see it.

13:06.610 --> 13:08.010
Yeah, there's a reflective
spot right there.

13:08.045 --> 13:08.810
You can't see the shooter's face,

13:08.910 --> 13:10.310
but you can see his sleeve.

13:10.910 --> 13:12.110
Yeah, he's got a green band

13:12.210 --> 13:14.010
around the cuff of his sleeve.

13:15.110 --> 13:16.810
That means it was a hotel jacket.

13:16.845 --> 13:18.510
So our killer might be an employee.

13:25.110 --> 13:27.010
So all the employee
lockers have been searched,

13:27.045 --> 13:28.910
and also the dumpsters
and the trash cans.

13:31.210 --> 13:34.510
Well, you gotta be somewhere
else to hide a bloody jacket.

13:37.610 --> 13:38.610
Bingo.

13:51.210 --> 13:52.610
Hey. Find something?

13:52.710 --> 13:54.010
Yeah. Take a look at this.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.110
Whoever did this decided

13:56.210 --> 13:58.610
to get the evidence
clean on the hotel's dime.

13:59.610 --> 14:00.610
NE Wait a minute.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.210
Look at that. Hole punch.

14:08.410 --> 14:10.710
The bellmen here use tret
to ID the luggage tags.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.010
Yeah, well, if the jacket fits...

14:17.010 --> 14:18.710
Luis Mendoza.

14:19.710 --> 14:21.310
You're a bellman at the Alon, right?

14:22.710 --> 14:23.510
Yeah.

14:23.810 --> 14:25.010
I work the night shift.

14:25.210 --> 14:27.210
Which ended just prior to the murder.

14:28.110 --> 14:28.910
The what?

14:29.310 --> 14:31.310
Young man was killed at the hotel.

14:31.910 --> 14:33.410
The killer was wearing your jacket.

14:33.510 --> 14:35.210
Whoa. How do you know that?

14:35.310 --> 14:37.410
We found your hole punch in the pocket.

14:38.910 --> 14:40.010
The hotel manager tells us

14:40.110 --> 14:42.160
that you're each
assigned a distinct shape

14:42.195 --> 14:44.210
so the hotel knows
who's punching what tag.

14:52.810 --> 14:54.210
Yeah, for accountability.

14:54.510 --> 14:56.510
So account for yourself, Luis.

15:00.410 --> 15:01.410
Why would I kill someone?

15:01.510 --> 15:04.310
Because you live in
Cobra Familia territory.

15:06.010 --> 15:06.910
I'm not in a gang.

15:07.010 --> 15:08.610
Maybe this was your ticket in.

15:09.810 --> 15:11.710
One shot, random location,

15:12.410 --> 15:13.610
random victim.

15:14.110 --> 15:15.810
Sounds like a gang initiation.

15:18.410 --> 15:19.210
Look.

15:20.010 --> 15:21.910
I know Cobra's big around here,

15:22.610 --> 15:24.410
which is why, when I'm
not working at the hotel,

15:24.710 --> 15:26.810
I'm doing construction
work during the day.

15:27.710 --> 15:29.310
Trying to save up enough money to move

15:29.410 --> 15:30.710
and get away from all these gangs.

15:30.810 --> 15:33.110
Then how do you explain
the blood on your jacket?

15:34.910 --> 15:35.710
Someone must have taken it

15:35.810 --> 15:36.910
from my locker.

15:38.810 --> 15:40.860
Until I can confirm that, Luis,

15:40.895 --> 15:42.910
you're our number one suspect.

15:46.110 --> 15:48.110
We're releasing you for now.

15:51.410 --> 15:53.410
The lieutenant said that
this was gang-related.

15:53.510 --> 15:55.210
Yeah, what about the
guy I saw you drag in?

15:55.410 --> 15:57.110
He sure as hell looked
like a gangbanger to me.

15:57.410 --> 15:59.010
Well, he's just someone
we're questioning.

15:59.710 --> 16:00.675
You really are versed

16:00.710 --> 16:01.810
on the script, aren't you?

16:07.410 --> 16:08.510
Is that him?

16:09.610 --> 16:10.810
Roger! Wait! Stop!

16:17.710 --> 16:20.610
Let's not do something you're
gonna regret, Mr. Partney.

16:20.910 --> 16:22.410
Somebody's gotta pay for this.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.510
And somebody will, if
you let me do my job.

16:25.545 --> 16:26.510
That's not good enough.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.610
I want him to suffer. Your being here

16:28.645 --> 16:30.610
is going to inflame the situation.

16:32.610 --> 16:33.710
We, uh, need to talk

16:33.810 --> 16:34.710
to your other son.

16:37.610 --> 16:38.710
He's in shock.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.610
Mr. NErtney, your son
may have seen something

16:40.710 --> 16:41.910
that could help us.

16:52.710 --> 16:53.910
How you doing, Shane?

16:56.210 --> 16:59.210
Shane, I wanted to ask you
about your brother, okay?

17:02.510 --> 17:03.610
To your knowledge, Shane,

17:03.710 --> 17:05.710
did he make any friends at the hotel?

17:08.210 --> 17:08.910
Not really.

17:09.010 --> 17:09.810
Okay.

17:10.609 --> 17:12.410
Did you notice anything this morning?

17:18.210 --> 17:19.410
Anything.

17:19.510 --> 17:21.310
Anything at all. Look,
I wasn't even there, Dad.

17:21.345 --> 17:22.510
I was in the parking garage.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.910
The garage could be helpful.

17:26.609 --> 17:27.210
Why?

17:27.310 --> 17:30.510
Because the killer may have
escaped through the garage.

17:33.310 --> 17:34.810
You had to have seen something.

17:34.910 --> 17:36.110
There's car's down there all the time.

17:36.210 --> 17:37.410
It's always busy.

17:43.210 --> 17:44.310
Come on, Shane.

17:44.510 --> 17:45.710
You could help your brother.

17:46.010 --> 17:46.710
Mr. Partney-

17:46.810 --> 17:48.910
allow him to think, please.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.610
Um... there was a motorcycle.

17:59.645 --> 18:02.210
It, it was... It was really loud.

18:08.510 --> 18:09.610
What did the guy look like?

18:09.710 --> 18:10.510
Dad, I don't know.

18:10.610 --> 18:11.510
How could you not know?

18:11.610 --> 18:13.610
I just heard it peel out
behind me, okay, Dad?!

18:13.645 --> 18:15.710
I didn't know Brian just got shot!

18:15.910 --> 18:19.210
Okay, great. So a motorcycle
that you didn't see. That's it?

18:19.310 --> 18:20.210
Mr. Partney.

18:22.110 --> 18:24.010
Thank you, Shane.
You've been very helpful.

18:29.210 --> 18:32.610
<i>You let your brother
down. You let me down.</i>

18:34.410 --> 18:36.210
<i>You let me down.</i>

18:43.410 --> 18:44.110
You needed to see me?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.310
Roger Partney.

18:45.410 --> 18:46.710
The victim's father. What about him?

18:47.110 --> 18:47.910
He's dangerous.

18:48.010 --> 18:49.510
- What you want me to do?
- Follow him.

19:15.161 --> 19:15.961
Hey, man.

19:17.061 --> 19:18.061
We got anything?

19:18.561 --> 19:20.061
Yeah, somebody burned rubber.

19:20.361 --> 19:21.161
That makes sense.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.061
Shane said he heard a
motorcycle speeding out of here.

19:25.561 --> 19:27.461
How do we explain this, the circle?

19:27.561 --> 19:29.061
Huh. Well...

19:29.861 --> 19:33.161
the rider, he locks up his front brake,

19:33.761 --> 19:35.161
goes full throttle...

19:36.661 --> 19:38.061
releases the clutch...

19:43.561 --> 19:45.361
He did over a 180-degree burner.

19:45.761 --> 19:46.361
Is there any way

19:46.461 --> 19:47.961
to tell what kind of
motorcycle this was?

19:48.361 --> 19:49.161
Yeah.

19:49.961 --> 19:51.161
Measure it.

19:52.361 --> 19:53.961
Go from the front tire mark...

19:55.761 --> 19:58.861
...to the outer part of
the circle... at 88 inches.

19:58.961 --> 19:59.961
Yeah.

20:00.161 --> 20:01.861
That's longer than the
standard motorcycle.

20:03.661 --> 20:04.561
Well, now...

20:06.561 --> 20:08.861
There's something wet in
the middle of this tread.

20:09.561 --> 20:10.261
Why don't you swab that,

20:10.296 --> 20:11.061
get it to the lab,

20:11.161 --> 20:12.561
and I'm gonna find out about the bike.

20:33.961 --> 20:35.061
Good timing.

20:35.261 --> 20:36.861
I just figured out our motorcycle.

20:38.761 --> 20:39.661
Take a look.

20:39.961 --> 20:41.461
It's an Angel 56?

20:41.661 --> 20:43.461
Yeah. I bet there are a lot of them

20:43.561 --> 20:44.861
registered here in Miami.

20:44.961 --> 20:46.861
Yeah, well, I think I
got a lead on the owner.

20:47.161 --> 20:47.861
Yeah?

20:48.261 --> 20:49.861
Yeah
- the substance on the tire tread.

20:50.761 --> 20:51.961
It's vegetable oil.

20:52.161 --> 20:53.861
Mmm. And how does that help us?

20:53.961 --> 20:56.411
Well, stunt riders attach
canisters to their bikes

20:56.446 --> 20:58.861
that rease the vegetable
oil onto the back tire.

20:58.896 --> 21:00.061
Gives a little more smoke.

21:00.461 --> 21:01.561
Okay. Good.

21:01.861 --> 21:02.861
Let's find a custom shop

21:02.961 --> 21:04.861
that uses vegetable oil on their bikes.

21:43.361 --> 21:44.361
What's up?!

21:45.061 --> 21:47.161
We understand you run
a custom motorcycle shop

21:47.261 --> 21:48.561
out of this place.

21:48.861 --> 21:49.661
Yeah, so?

21:49.961 --> 21:51.761
So, you got an Angel 56 around here?

21:52.361 --> 21:53.361
Used to.

21:57.761 --> 21:59.461
That bike was seen leaving

21:59.561 --> 22:01.261
a murder scene this morning.

22:03.561 --> 22:04.961
Means it's state's evidence.

22:07.361 --> 22:08.561
Take it. It's yours.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.361
Well, by setting that
fire, you're interferring

22:10.461 --> 22:11.961
with an ongoing murder investigation.

22:11.996 --> 22:13.161
It's my property.

22:13.261 --> 22:14.861
You can't arrest me for
trashing my own bike.

22:14.961 --> 22:16.461
If it's your property-

22:16.661 --> 22:17.761
did you drive it this morning?

22:18.961 --> 22:19.961
Nah, not today.

22:20.061 --> 22:21.161
Who did?

22:24.561 --> 22:27.661
See? That's why I love my neighbors.

22:28.061 --> 22:29.461
We share everything!

22:30.161 --> 22:31.561
We all ride that bike.

22:32.861 --> 22:34.261
You going to arrest us all?

22:36.061 --> 22:37.161
Yeah, I am-

22:37.961 --> 22:39.861
eventually
- so stick around.

22:47.161 --> 22:48.361
If we think this was a gang hit,

22:48.461 --> 22:51.061
remind me again why we're
going through the victim's bag.

22:51.461 --> 22:53.261
I just want to make absolutely certain

22:53.361 --> 22:55.361
that there's no other possible motive.

22:55.661 --> 22:57.461
Okay, you sift through it.

22:57.561 --> 22:58.761
I'll, uh... log the items.

22:58.861 --> 22:59.861
Thanks.

23:00.061 --> 23:01.761
You're welcome. Okay.

23:01.796 --> 23:02.961
Clothing,

23:03.861 --> 23:07.361
toiletry bag-
cologne, Q-Tips,

23:07.761 --> 23:09.161
razor, floss,

23:09.361 --> 23:11.061
toothpaste
- the ush.

23:11.861 --> 23:12.761
Blue jeans.

23:14.361 --> 23:15.161
Wait a minute.

23:17.461 --> 23:18.361
What? You got something?

23:18.561 --> 23:19.661
The bellboy at the
hotel- Luis Mendoza-

23:19.761 --> 23:21.161
he had a hole punch.

23:21.761 --> 23:23.861
And it was palm tree-shaped,
just like this one.

23:24.661 --> 23:25.561
Yeah.

23:26.661 --> 23:28.361
I think we may have
just solved our case.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.161
At the very least,

23:50.261 --> 23:51.961
he must have broken into Brian's bag.

23:52.961 --> 23:53.961
You know, I'll call Delko

23:54.061 --> 23:55.461
and have him head back to the hotel.

23:55.961 --> 23:58.261
Wait, his shift is over,
and I remember he said

23:58.361 --> 24:00.761
that he works after hours
at a construction site.

24:11.661 --> 24:12.661
Luis!

24:14.661 --> 24:17.161
Luis Mendoza!

24:20.461 --> 24:21.461
Luis!

24:26.061 --> 24:27.861
This still looks wet, Eric.

24:29.661 --> 24:31.061
You think he killed again?

24:33.561 --> 24:34.561
I don't know.

24:38.161 --> 24:39.361
He may have.

24:44.261 --> 24:44.961
Luis.

24:47.461 --> 24:49.361
Luis. Call it in, Eric.

24:49.561 --> 24:50.661
India 2100.

24:50.761 --> 24:52.961
I need Fire-Rescue re a
victim with a head injury.

24:53.061 --> 24:55.761
Also, roll out an additional
backup unit to my location.

24:58.361 --> 24:59.761
Luis, who did this to you?

25:00.061 --> 25:00.961
I don't know.

25:01.961 --> 25:03.361
Pissed-off white dude.

25:03.861 --> 25:05.261
He hit me from behind.

25:11.961 --> 25:13.461
Did you get a look at his face?

25:14.161 --> 25:15.261
<i>Nada. All right.</i>

25:15.361 --> 25:16.361
We're going to get you in the hospital.

25:16.461 --> 25:18.961
Eric, stay with him, please.

25:20.461 --> 25:21.661
We have anything to go on?

25:21.761 --> 25:23.961
No. But I think I know where to start.

25:33.661 --> 25:36.561
So you eluded my
surveillance, Mr. Partney.

25:38.461 --> 25:40.761
You mean that bald
guy you had tailing me?

25:41.361 --> 25:44.361
Who are you to be following
me when that guy killed my son?

25:45.561 --> 25:47.761
Did you do that, Mr. Partney?

25:51.261 --> 25:51.961
NoNE

25:52.761 --> 25:56.061
This punk took the most precious thing

25:56.096 --> 25:57.361
in my life and destroyed it.

25:57.461 --> 25:58.461
We don't know that yet.

26:00.761 --> 26:01.561
I'm not going to sit here

26:01.661 --> 26:04.461
and listen to you
defend my son's murderer.

26:05.961 --> 26:06.661
Are we through?

26:06.761 --> 26:10.061
Not until you can account
for yourself, Mr. Partney.

26:15.661 --> 26:16.561
Officer...

26:19.661 --> 26:20.561
take him.

26:21.861 --> 26:22.961
You're arresting me?

26:23.661 --> 26:24.761
I'm a victim!

26:25.261 --> 26:26.661
Not anymore.

26:51.661 --> 26:53.461
This 2x4 that was used on Luis Mendoza,

26:53.561 --> 26:54.561
did you run it yet? Yeah.

26:54.661 --> 26:56.161
I should have the results momentarily.

26:57.161 --> 26:58.561
Horatio suspects

26:58.661 --> 26:59.961
that the father might be involved.

27:00.061 --> 27:01.561
Out for revenge.

27:02.361 --> 27:03.361
Let's see what we find.

27:10.361 --> 27:11.761
It's a familial match.

27:14.561 --> 27:15.561
It's the dad?

27:16.961 --> 27:17.761
No.

27:23.261 --> 27:24.361
Brian was my best friend.

27:28.161 --> 27:32.761
When we were kids, our grandpa
gave him a pocket watch.

27:33.161 --> 27:34.061
And, uh...

27:35.961 --> 27:37.861
I got so jealous that
I used to steal it.

27:41.461 --> 27:42.761
He never got mad.

27:45.061 --> 27:46.861
Instead, he saved up his allowance money

27:46.896 --> 27:48.561
and got me one of my own.

27:50.061 --> 27:51.661
We still carry them everywhere we go.

27:56.561 --> 27:57.561
And that's why you took your

27:57.596 --> 27:59.161
anger out on Luis.

28:20.661 --> 28:22.561
He deserved it after
what he did to Brian.

28:25.261 --> 28:26.061
Shane...

28:26.761 --> 28:28.211
we don't know that the man you hurt

28:28.246 --> 28:29.661
is the man who killed your brother.

28:33.761 --> 28:34.761
What do you mean?

28:35.361 --> 28:37.361
The evidence is inconclusive, Shane.

28:45.861 --> 28:47.161
You going to tell my parents what I did?

28:49.061 --> 28:51.661
We need you to understand
that it's past that point.

28:54.161 --> 28:55.561
But that guy didn't die. Shane,

28:55.661 --> 28:57.661
you could be charged
with attempted murder.

28:58.661 --> 28:59.761
I don't understand.

29:01.661 --> 29:02.961
If you're convicted, you could be

29:03.061 --> 29:05.561
in the Florida penal
system until you're 25.

29:09.861 --> 29:10.661
I mean, Shane, do you realize

29:10.761 --> 29:12.461
how much trouble you're in?

29:25.561 --> 29:26.961
Shane said his brother always carried

29:27.061 --> 29:28.861
a pocket watch with him, right?

29:29.361 --> 29:31.061
Wasn't in the evidence log.

29:31.861 --> 29:33.661
That doesn't mean that
it wasn't with him.

29:37.361 --> 29:39.061
Maybe that's why he looked down.

30:13.861 --> 30:14.861
You were right.

30:15.361 --> 30:16.861
The watch was in the elevator shaft.

30:19.561 --> 30:21.161
The watch wasn't the only thing.

30:22.261 --> 30:23.161
What have you got?

30:23.861 --> 30:25.161
Our missing bullet.

31:01.561 --> 31:02.561
You checking out?

31:02.661 --> 31:04.461
Nope. Just taking a
little trip. Thank you.

31:05.461 --> 31:07.461
You're not going anywhere, Mr. Garza.

31:11.761 --> 31:12.861
Garza's my mother's maiden name.

31:12.896 --> 31:13.761
Sure, it is.

31:13.861 --> 31:15.961
And you're not from New
York either, are you?

31:20.461 --> 31:22.461
Every man has his secrets, Lieutenant.

31:24.661 --> 31:28.261
Speaking of which
- that's a. 38 caliber,

31:28.361 --> 31:31.561
the same gun that killed
Brian Partney, Mr. Garza.

31:36.661 --> 31:37.861
Yeah, that's my gun,

31:38.861 --> 31:40.661
but you can't put it in
my hands for the murder.

31:40.761 --> 31:42.261
Not yet.

31:43.161 --> 31:44.461
Hook him up, please.

31:57.745 --> 32:00.445
So Mitch Pena just
tested negative for GSR.

32:01.045 --> 32:01.745
There goes our case,

32:01.845 --> 32:03.845
unless you can put that. 38 in his hands.

32:04.045 --> 32:05.845
Still got nothing. They
wiped this thing down.

32:09.345 --> 32:10.945
Then I guess this guy goes back on the streets.

32:13.945 --> 32:15.445
You know, ry one more thing.

32:15.745 --> 32:17.445
It's a long shot, though,
ocbut it might work.

32:17.545 --> 32:18.145
What do you have in mind?

32:18.245 --> 32:19.945
Well, gang members don't carry holsters,

32:20.045 --> 32:21.445
so they carry their
guns one of two ways,

32:21.545 --> 32:23.845
either in their pocket or
like they do in the movies.

32:23.945 --> 32:25.445
In the waistband. Exactly.

32:25.645 --> 32:26.745
And if this was a gang initiation,

32:26.845 --> 32:28.245
he would have been
a first-time shooter,

32:28.280 --> 32:29.245
so he would have been nervous.

32:29.345 --> 32:31.145
Combine that with the Miami humidity...

32:40.145 --> 32:41.245
and guess what.

32:42.545 --> 32:45.045
A little sweat goes a long way.

32:45.945 --> 32:47.245
I'm impressed.

33:10.645 --> 33:11.645
Look at that.

33:12.645 --> 33:14.945
Vasco Torres was packing
this particular heat.

33:15.845 --> 33:16.745
That's the guy who set fire

33:16.845 --> 33:17.745
to his motorcycle.

33:17.845 --> 33:19.245
Now it looks like he
killed Brian Partney.

33:20.645 --> 33:22.845
Yeah, well, that would fit
our gang-initiation theory.

33:23.245 --> 33:24.945
If he's a new gang member,
he's gonna be a flight risk,

33:24.980 --> 33:26.445
and if we put out a BOLO, the Cobras

33:26.545 --> 33:27.745
are gonna try to get
him out of the country.

33:27.845 --> 33:29.845
If we don't pick him up now,
we're gonna lose him forever.

33:32.945 --> 33:33.945
<i>Airship to ground unit,</i>

33:34.045 --> 33:35.845
<i>two radio cars to rear entrance.</i>

33:35.945 --> 33:36.945
<i>Secure containment.</i>

34:11.245 --> 34:12.945
Vasco Torres, you're under arrest.

34:18.145 --> 34:20.745
Pretty bold coming
into my house uninvited.

34:25.344 --> 34:26.344
Don't be stupid.

34:36.945 --> 34:38.145
I'm Cobra Familia.

34:39.045 --> 34:40.745
Who's the one being stupid, huh?

34:43.645 --> 34:45.245
It's not going down like that.

34:47.945 --> 34:49.344
You want to drop the gun

34:49.844 --> 34:51.245
and I'm gonna take you in.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.045
I don't think so.

35:02.345 --> 35:03.145
Bye.

35:13.745 --> 35:16.345
Come with me and nobody else gets hurt.

35:16.545 --> 35:17.145
If i don't?

35:17.245 --> 35:18.645
You'll end up like your friend.

35:18.745 --> 35:19.945
Your choice.

35:39.045 --> 35:41.445
We've got your DNA on the murder weapon,

35:41.545 --> 35:44.445
but the gun was found in your car.

35:46.545 --> 35:51.445
Whoever talks first, gentlemen,
gets the better deal. Go.

35:58.745 --> 36:01.045
The truth is ver shot
that kid in cold blood.

36:10.845 --> 36:12.645
He held that gun to my head,

36:12.680 --> 36:14.445
said if I wanted in the Cobras,

36:14.645 --> 36:16.245
that white kid had to eat a bullet.

36:19.345 --> 36:20.545
<i>Kill him inside the hotel?</i>

36:20.945 --> 36:22.445
That's not the way Cobras roll.

36:23.145 --> 36:24.445
You want to be a Cobra?

36:25.445 --> 36:26.445
You'll do it...

36:27.545 --> 36:28.645
or I'll drop you.

36:35.945 --> 36:36.845
Look...

36:38.645 --> 36:42.645
a gang prospect makes his
bones with a random kill.

36:46.845 --> 36:49.045
This time I had a personal investment.

36:50.445 --> 36:53.245
Yeah, rich chick hooks
you up with in a nice hotel

36:53.280 --> 36:54.145
then cheats on you.

36:54.180 --> 36:55.145
She was drunk.

36:58.345 --> 36:59.545
I blame him.

37:01.245 --> 37:02.945
I sent the kid a text message

37:03.645 --> 37:04.745
on Amy's phone.

37:06.045 --> 37:08.145
I told him to come by and say good-bye.

37:09.745 --> 37:11.445
I wanted to watch him die.

37:49.045 --> 37:50.545
Should have been perfect.

37:51.745 --> 37:53.745
<i>My part was perfect.</i>

37:55.045 --> 37:59.145
Got in using a hotel jacket,
killed him with one shot.

38:00.645 --> 38:01.945
Did it like a pro.

38:03.245 --> 38:04.545
Like a Cobra.

38:19.445 --> 38:21.345
Screwed it all up over a girl.

38:22.145 --> 38:24.045
Don't you forget who
you're talking to, huh?

38:24.345 --> 38:25.445
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

39:10.845 --> 39:12.545
That kid whose brother got killed,

39:13.445 --> 39:14.745
he's the one who hit me?

39:15.145 --> 39:16.345
He's the one, Luis.

39:16.445 --> 39:18.945
I understand you're planning
to testify for the state.

39:19.045 --> 39:20.295
Hey, man, he attacked me.

39:20.330 --> 39:21.545
I'm the innocent one here.

39:23.945 --> 39:24.845
If you do that, Luis,

39:24.945 --> 39:27.245
this kid is gonna go
to jail for a long time.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.145
He should.

39:28.845 --> 39:30.845
I lost my construction
job because of all this.

39:32.145 --> 39:34.445
There are other jobs, Luis.

39:37.145 --> 39:39.745
Not for me, man. You've
seen where I live.

39:42.445 --> 39:45.945
What if I, Luis, were to get
you another place to live?

39:49.245 --> 39:51.345
You gonna help me?

39:51.545 --> 39:52.945
I would do that for you.

39:57.245 --> 39:59.745
You help me, I'll help you.

40:01.045 --> 40:02.345
Thank you, Luis.

40:09.245 --> 40:10.445
Mrs. Partney,

40:12.345 --> 40:13.945
I have Brian's pocket watch.

40:16.345 --> 40:18.845
Unfortunately, it got
broken this morning.

40:21.045 --> 40:22.145
During the murder?

40:23.545 --> 40:24.645
I'm afraid so.

40:31.345 --> 40:36.045
Means this is the exact
time my son was killed.

40:45.345 --> 40:46.345
Is that him?

40:47.945 --> 40:49.745
Is that the man who killed my son?

40:50.145 --> 40:52.245
It is. We got him.

40:53.445 --> 40:57.245
Well, I... I need to ask him why.

40:57.945 --> 40:59.445
I'm the mother, and I deserve to know.

40:59.545 --> 41:00.210
No, I understand that,

41:00.245 --> 41:02.645
but I can't let you do that. I'm sorry.

41:41.445 --> 41:43.045
Is there something you want to tell me?

41:46.945 --> 41:48.245
You killed my son.
