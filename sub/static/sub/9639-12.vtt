WEBVTT

00:08.780 --> 00:12.340
All right, my little history wranglers,
enough ruckus.

00:13.420 --> 00:16.390
Let's start off Thursday's class
like we always do:

00:16.520 --> 00:18.320
With an oral pop quiz.

00:18.460 --> 00:22.120
Oh, my gosh. lt's the Thursday pop quiz
we have every Thursday.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.860
l'm totally caught off-guard.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.860
ln no particular order:
Wendy Bott, you're up.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.930
The French and lndian War
was fought by three groups of people.

00:31.070 --> 00:32.200
Name two of them.

00:33.810 --> 00:35.740
The French was one for sure.

00:35.870 --> 00:39.240
And the other one,
l'm just gonna guess, lndians?

00:39.380 --> 00:40.970
Excellent.

00:42.950 --> 00:45.640
Nellie Rodriguez. You're up.

00:46.490 --> 00:50.820
The War of 1812 started in what year?

00:51.720 --> 00:55.020
Oh, my gosh, l studied for this one.

00:56.300 --> 00:59.260
- 1812?
- Another winner.

01:01.370 --> 01:02.700
Alex Russo.

01:04.900 --> 01:07.170
The Monroe Doctrine.
What is it? When was it passed?

01:07.310 --> 01:09.430
And please give
a two-minute argument defending it.

01:10.910 --> 01:13.640
Hold on. The other two questions
had the answers in them.

01:13.780 --> 01:14.940
My question's supposed to be:

01:15.080 --> 01:16.980
The Monroe Doctrine,
whose doctrine is it?

01:17.120 --> 01:21.990
l'd say ''Monroe'' and you'd say,
''Yipee-dilly-lily, way to go, little filly.''

01:25.090 --> 01:28.580
Oh, Alex. You are definitely not
your brother Justin.

01:28.730 --> 01:31.060
No, l'm not. l'm cuter, more fun to talk to

01:31.200 --> 01:33.720
and l don't have dental floss
on a key chain.

01:33.870 --> 01:35.600
Yeah, well, l do.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.370
Justin made it for me.

01:40.510 --> 01:43.740
Oh, Justin. Those were the days.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.800
Can you believe this?
He's comparing me to Justin.

01:47.950 --> 01:50.970
l know.
lt is so hard to live up to Justin.

01:51.120 --> 01:55.020
He's smart and handsome,
and he has the healthiest gums.

01:55.150 --> 01:56.780
- l mean--
- Okay, l get it, he flosses.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.390
Let's make him president.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.510 --> 02:55.780
How was school today?
Wait, let me guess who got in trouble?

02:59.080 --> 03:01.280
Well, l got a hard quiz question
because of Justin,

03:01.420 --> 03:03.120
got in trouble because of Justin,

03:03.260 --> 03:06.710
and got recruited by the math team
because of Justin.

03:07.930 --> 03:09.190
What are you smiling about?

03:09.330 --> 03:12.160
l have had a much more productive day
than l realized.

03:14.830 --> 03:16.100
Okay.

03:16.240 --> 03:20.070
Today's lesson is about genies.

03:20.210 --> 03:21.970
Oh, l know a Jeannie.

03:22.110 --> 03:24.200
Jeannie Kowalski.

03:24.840 --> 03:27.440
Jeannies do not like it
when you flick them in the ear.

03:29.110 --> 03:30.550
That's lesson number one.

03:31.450 --> 03:33.320
No, lesson number one
is leave that girl alone.

03:33.450 --> 03:34.710
She's bigger than you.

03:35.750 --> 03:39.320
And lesson number two
is about genies that live in a lamp.

03:39.460 --> 03:42.550
And they are the con artists
of the wizard world.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.160
l thought they were
supposed to grant you three wishes.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.790
They do, but they take your wish

03:46.930 --> 03:50.130
and they twist it around into something
you wish you never wished for.

03:50.570 --> 03:52.040
ls Alex a genie?

03:54.170 --> 03:56.000
No, she's just your older sister.

03:56.140 --> 03:58.540
But good, Max.
You understand the concept.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.080
No genie can trick me. l'd make them wish
that they never met me.

04:03.220 --> 04:05.780
You don't have to be a genie
to wish you never met you.

04:07.190 --> 04:09.090
So are we gonna take
this genie out or what?

04:09.220 --> 04:12.550
You can't take the genies
out of their lamps, because they're tricky.

04:12.690 --> 04:14.320
Once out, it's hard to get them back in.

04:14.460 --> 04:18.660
Yeah, Alex, this was all in the handout,
which you obviously didn't read.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.529
Why can't you be
more like your brother?

04:20.670 --> 04:22.960
Because l don't want to grow old alone.

04:25.570 --> 04:26.630
Wait a minute.

04:26.770 --> 04:29.900
So we're getting a genie lesson
without seeing a genie?

04:30.040 --> 04:34.210
No, the genie is not coming
out of the lamp, we're going into the lamp.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.110
Come on. Justin, take us in.

04:38.020 --> 04:41.450
we are now small and teeny-weeny
Take us inside to see the genie

04:48.730 --> 04:51.490
Oh, Christmas carolers.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.330
lt's a little early.

04:54.470 --> 04:56.400
But who doesn't love
a little ''Jingle Bell Rock''?

04:56.540 --> 04:59.770
Hit it, boys.
A one, two, a one, two, three, four.

05:00.470 --> 05:02.170
Hi. We're not carolers.

05:02.880 --> 05:06.470
We're on a field trip.
l'm just showing these young wizards

05:06.610 --> 05:08.770
what a genie
looks like in its natural habitat.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.320
l'm sorry. l wasn't expecting company.

05:13.450 --> 05:15.940
l don't have enough food...

05:19.120 --> 05:22.030
...to make dinner for all of us.

05:22.160 --> 05:27.260
But l know this amazing pizzeria--
Everybody likes pizza, right?

05:27.400 --> 05:30.630
--on 86th and a Columbus
with a topping bar.

05:30.770 --> 05:31.900
A topping bar?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.940
- How's that for a topper?
- That sounds great.

05:34.070 --> 05:36.130
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.470
We are now small and teeny-weeny,
but instead--

05:38.940 --> 05:41.210
See that, Dad? She thought
a genie wouldn't outsmart her,

05:41.350 --> 05:42.750
and she almost set her free.

05:43.180 --> 05:45.810
Hello. l was about to put my hand
over my own mouth.

05:46.850 --> 05:50.720
This is why l brought you here.
To show you how tricky genies can be.

05:50.860 --> 05:54.260
That's right. Genies can be very tricky.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.850
Hey, let's go talk about it over a latte.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.930
There's this place in Brooklyn
that makes these lattes with basil in them.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.200
Basil lattes. That sounds great.
Why don't you get your jacket and we'll go.

06:07.340 --> 06:08.570
Yes.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.770
See that? l just outsmarted the genie.
Now let's get out of here.

06:11.910 --> 06:14.280
And l just found out
there's a pizzeria with a topping bar.

06:14.410 --> 06:16.110
Take us out.

06:16.550 --> 06:20.750
we are now small and teeny-weeny
we are done visiting the genie

06:38.970 --> 06:40.800
Oh, it's you.

06:42.270 --> 06:45.540
l was just in the middle
of snaking my drain.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.350
Okay. Thank you for rubbing my lamp.

06:49.480 --> 06:52.080
You have a lot of choices in lamps,
l appreciate choosing mine.

06:52.220 --> 06:55.310
Your wish is my command.
You're entitled to three wishes, blah, blah.

06:55.450 --> 06:58.480
Not valid in Vermont or Connecticut.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.090
Okay. l wish people
would stop comparing me to Justin.

07:03.230 --> 07:06.390
Oh, your older brother?
He seems really sharp.

07:06.530 --> 07:09.930
l'm glad he's not my brother.
l could never live in that shadow.

07:10.070 --> 07:11.300
That's what l'm talking about.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.870
- Let's get to the wish.
- Okay.

07:16.110 --> 07:18.540
- lsn't that the Macarena?
- Hold on.

07:19.110 --> 07:20.670
Yeah, they stole it from us.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.210
Okay. You're good.

07:25.350 --> 07:27.780
You will no longer be compared
to your brother.

07:28.650 --> 07:34.120
So you probably heard
genies are always trying to sneak off.

07:34.630 --> 07:38.260
- You can't sneak off if l'm letting you go.
- You're letting me go?

07:38.400 --> 07:40.260
Sure, go on. l got my wish.

07:41.070 --> 07:42.590
Class is starting. Beat it.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.330
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.030
Okay, my wily coyotes.

07:49.810 --> 07:53.770
lt's time for a surprise
Thursday pop quiz,

07:53.910 --> 07:56.570
on Friday.

07:56.720 --> 08:00.240
- Alex Russo.
- Here we go.

08:00.390 --> 08:04.080
Name two of the three people who were
on the Lewis and Clark Expedition,

08:04.220 --> 08:07.450
which also featured Sacagawea.

08:08.630 --> 08:13.460
- Did you just give me all three answers?
- No fair. l'm not giving hints.

08:14.470 --> 08:15.830
Okay.

08:15.970 --> 08:19.200
Then l'm gonna say Lewis and Clark.

08:19.340 --> 08:20.670
And Sacagawea.

08:22.070 --> 08:24.800
Three out of three.
And l only asked for two.

08:24.940 --> 08:28.240
l think we have a winner.

08:28.380 --> 08:31.650
Actually, let's let Alex ring the bell.

08:34.220 --> 08:36.020
ls there somebody
you wanna compare me to?

08:36.490 --> 08:39.690
- No.
- Thank you, genie.

08:42.659 --> 08:43.789
Can you believe it?

08:43.929 --> 08:47.920
He didn't ask me some ridiculous question
that only Justin would know the answer to.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.500
- Who's Justin?
- What do you mean, ''Who's Justin?''

08:51.040 --> 08:52.230
- Hey, Justin.
- Alex.

08:52.370 --> 08:53.800
The weirdest thing happened to me.

08:53.940 --> 08:56.530
l got kicked out of chemistry
because l wasn't on the class list.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.540
And l told Mrs. Rieber
it had to be a mistake,

08:58.680 --> 09:01.940
l've been there all semester,
but she still didn't remember me.

09:02.750 --> 09:03.810
Oh, that is weird.

09:03.950 --> 09:07.480
You'd think she'd remember the student
that came with the periodic element song.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.310
Hydrogen then helium

09:09.450 --> 09:11.010
Lithium, beryllium

09:11.160 --> 09:13.680
Boron

09:15.390 --> 09:18.390
Speaking of borons, why don't you go
tell your friends about your problem.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.030
Fine.

09:21.170 --> 09:22.220
That's Justin?

09:22.370 --> 09:24.730
The new guy who's H-O-T cute?

09:24.870 --> 09:29.030
No, the guy who's my brother
who's V-E-R-Y dorky.

09:29.170 --> 09:31.640
No, you only have one brother.
His name is Max.

09:33.610 --> 09:37.550
Oh, my gosh.
Harper, l'm gonna catch up with you later.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.450
Fine. But l call dibs
on that new Justin guy.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.380
- l liked him first.
- Dibs acknowledged.

09:42.520 --> 09:46.890
We played video games together.
Yesterday. Remember?

09:47.030 --> 09:48.720
l got overexcited and hyperventilated.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.760
Your mom had to get me a bag.

09:52.460 --> 09:55.160
Sorry, dude. Good luck with whatever.

09:59.670 --> 10:03.270
l don't have any friends.
My teacher doesn't remember me.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.100
What did you do?

10:06.880 --> 10:10.040
Why? Just because something
completely out of the ordinary happens

10:10.180 --> 10:12.450
doesn't mean l automatically had
something to do with it.

10:12.580 --> 10:14.450
- Did you have something to do with it?
- Yes.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.460
l made a wish with the genie that everyone
would stop comparing me to you,

10:19.590 --> 10:21.790
but l guess she did
that by making everyone forget you.

10:21.930 --> 10:24.290
Okay. Tell the genie
you wish everyone remembers me again.

10:24.430 --> 10:27.870
l can't. l let her go.
That way she couldn't sneak off.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.830
Oh, l get it. lt's kind of like giving a burglar
your money so he doesn't steal it.

10:34.270 --> 10:36.900
- Look, what do you want me to do?
- You've done enough.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.740
We're gonna have to get Dad to help us.

10:39.510 --> 10:42.610
Hi, l'm Jerry, Alex's father.
Nice to meet you.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.140
We already met.

10:48.390 --> 10:51.050
l don't think Dad's gonna help us.

10:52.290 --> 10:57.490
Hey, who's your new friend? He's cute.
He looks a little like your Uncle Ernesto.

11:01.330 --> 11:03.800
lt's not just school,
no one remembers me.

11:04.670 --> 11:07.930
Look on the bright side.
l bet you don't have to do dishes tonight.

11:13.850 --> 11:16.940
Okay, Justin. l know this looks bad.
No one remembers you.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.810
But l'll fix it.
ln the meantime, think of all the benefits.

11:20.690 --> 11:22.880
- Like not having to do the dishes?
- Yeah.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.990
l'd trade that
for my parents remembering me.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.280
Where am l supposed to sleep tonight?

11:28.930 --> 11:32.330
l fell asleep at table five one night.
lt's pretty comfortable.

11:35.670 --> 11:37.860
Okay. Follow my lead.

11:42.010 --> 11:45.600
Mom, Justin's parents
are out of town for a week,

11:45.740 --> 11:51.080
and he doesn't have a place to stay,
and he lost his key when he tripped

11:51.220 --> 11:54.880
- and he fell down the subway grate.
Oh, my goodness.

23:52.500 --> 23:56.270
Well, Justin, you're more than welcome
to stay with us until your parents get back.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.740
- Really? Thank you.
- See that? Problem solved.

23:59.870 --> 24:01.570
Yeah, everything's great.

24:01.710 --> 24:03.610
lt's just my parents
don't know who l am.

24:05.050 --> 24:08.010
Hey, Max.
Do you still remember me, buddy?

24:08.750 --> 24:09.910
Of course l do.

24:10.850 --> 24:14.220
- You do?
- Yes. You're Uncle Ernesto.

24:15.890 --> 24:17.910
l have seen you in Mom's pictures.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.360
Alex. Look what l made in art class.

24:24.500 --> 24:27.300
lt's a bust of that new kid, Justin.

24:27.430 --> 24:30.200
- Do you think he'll like it?
- l don't know. Why don't you ask him?

24:30.770 --> 24:31.860
Oh, my gosh. He's here.

24:32.010 --> 24:33.470
How do l look?

24:34.210 --> 24:35.870
Better than him.

24:36.340 --> 24:40.940
Justin, look who's here.
And she made something nice-ish.

24:41.820 --> 24:42.910
Hey, Harper.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.810
You know my name?

24:46.250 --> 24:50.420
l made this for you.
Oh, that's not my lipstick on the cheek.

24:51.530 --> 24:54.190
Thanks, Harper. l'll put it in my room.

24:54.330 --> 24:56.090
As soon as my parents
get back in town.

24:56.230 --> 24:58.250
- Oh, where are you staying?
- Here.

24:58.400 --> 25:02.560
He's already moved in?
You do not respect the code of dibs.

25:06.170 --> 25:09.370
Harper made a bust of Uncle Ernesto?

25:09.910 --> 25:11.000
lt's me.

25:13.410 --> 25:14.740
That's still weird.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.610
Alex, we have to do something.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.310
You know...

25:20.450 --> 25:21.510
They can't forget you.

25:21.660 --> 25:24.060
You're their first-born.
Maybe we can jog their memory.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.950
Mr. Russo and Mrs. Russo,
since l'll be staying,

25:28.090 --> 25:30.120
it would be rude
if l didn't let you get to know me.

25:30.260 --> 25:32.030
So tell us about yourself.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.900
- Well, Justin loves school.
- Loves school?

25:36.040 --> 25:38.470
Oh, we never hear that around here.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.710
And l love watching sports with my dad.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.970
- Go Mets.
- A Mets fan.

25:44.110 --> 25:47.240
You should've started with that.
Now, Jets or Giants?

25:47.980 --> 25:49.850
- Jets.
- There it is.

25:49.980 --> 25:52.280
Welcome to the family, Justin.

25:52.990 --> 25:56.420
Justin is a great catch.
You should go out with him.

25:57.090 --> 26:01.150
Gross. That's exactly how l felt
about your father when l first met him,

26:01.290 --> 26:04.160
and now he's my big cuddly bug.

26:05.470 --> 26:07.020
Grosser.

26:08.270 --> 26:11.970
Justin is a fine young man.
You should be more like him.

26:14.710 --> 26:17.870
Even when they don't know you,
they want me to be more like you.

26:18.450 --> 26:20.110
You can't wish away quality.

26:26.090 --> 26:28.050
Okay, how are you
gonna get the genie back?

26:28.190 --> 26:31.210
l don't know.
l've just been racking my brain.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.950
l just wish the genie would show up.

26:35.430 --> 26:37.290
What just happened?

26:37.430 --> 26:39.920
You wished for the genie to come back
and she came back.

26:42.170 --> 26:45.730
And stumbling on that,
you just used your second wish.

26:45.870 --> 26:49.170
Okay, Alex, you have one wish left.
Choose your words really carefully.

26:49.310 --> 26:51.300
l know, l know.
l wish you would stop telling me--

26:51.440 --> 26:55.380
That's not it, that's not it.
l'm gonna get this right. Okay.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.380
l wish people would-- No, no, no. No.

26:58.520 --> 27:02.280
l wish Justin would be--
No, no, no. No, you'll wreck that.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.320
l wish my first wish--
l wish my brother--

27:05.460 --> 27:07.720
This is gonna be good.

27:08.190 --> 27:11.130
- Oh, l've got it.
- Hold up. Let me hear it.

27:11.260 --> 27:16.070
Okay. l wish everyone
would see Justin clearly for who he is.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.660
Wait. There could be a problem
if you say the word--

27:19.810 --> 27:20.860
''Clearly.''

27:21.910 --> 27:25.870
And that's my triple play.
Thanks for rubbing my lamp.

27:26.010 --> 27:29.970
Really. lt's yours to keep.
ln fact, use it as a gravy boat.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.310
Just remember
it's not dishwasher safe.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.780
You know what?
Throw it in the dishwasher, l don't care.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.350
Alex, look what you've done.
You've ruined my life.

27:39.230 --> 27:43.160
Hold on. You're invisible. lsn't there
something you've always wanted to do?

27:43.300 --> 27:44.990
Someone you've always wanted
to get back at

27:45.130 --> 27:47.930
and they would never know
because you're invisible?

27:48.870 --> 27:50.200
There. l've done it.

27:50.670 --> 27:53.200
- Okay. l had that coming.
- Now fix this.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.830
Hey, you kids want some ice cream?

27:56.940 --> 28:00.240
- What are you doing?
- This way l'll be totally invisible.

28:00.810 --> 28:03.080
No. Just hide.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.620
Don't look.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.320
- Where's your friend?
- Bathroom?

28:14.290 --> 28:16.020
l love talking sports with him.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.030
l'll sit right here
and wait till he gets back.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.560
No, no, Dad, not there.

28:20.070 --> 28:22.660
- Why not?
- Because l'm gonna sit there.

28:28.780 --> 28:30.830
l like sitting here.

28:36.320 --> 28:37.680
Who was that?

28:38.850 --> 28:41.620
Alex Russo, what is going on here?

28:42.620 --> 28:45.110
And why is there a pillow
floating in midair?

28:47.630 --> 28:50.560
Justin's invisible
and not wearing any clothes.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.200
Jerry, what's wrong?

28:53.330 --> 28:57.670
l just sat down
on Alex's invisible friend Justin.

28:59.440 --> 29:03.030
- Justin, what did Alex do to you?
- Yeah, l don't know.

29:03.180 --> 29:05.870
And l'm sure this may seem like magic,

29:06.010 --> 29:10.110
but l'm sure there's a perfectly rational,
scientific explanation for all of it--

29:10.250 --> 29:14.450
- Dad, Justin knows about magic.
- Okay, what did she do to you?

29:14.590 --> 29:15.650
- Well, she--
- Wait.

29:15.790 --> 29:17.550
ls he holding that pillow to...?

29:18.460 --> 29:21.050
Oh, that's my good pillow.

29:23.700 --> 29:28.230
And since it's the only thing l can see,
l don't feel very comfortable talking to it.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.240
Just talk to Uncle Ernesto.

29:35.180 --> 29:37.840
Alex, what did you do to him?

29:39.510 --> 29:41.880
Okay, l'll tell you.

29:42.020 --> 29:45.110
- But you're never gonna believe me.
- Of course we'll believe you.

29:45.590 --> 29:48.710
Justin is my brother
and your oldest son.

29:49.460 --> 29:50.820
l don't believe you.

29:51.560 --> 29:52.650
No, it's true.

29:52.790 --> 29:55.850
l made a wish with the genie that everyone
would stop comparing me to Justin,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.090
but the genie conned me
and made everyone forget him.

29:58.230 --> 30:01.460
- And then he became invisible.
- She's telling the truth.

30:05.210 --> 30:07.870
You're trying to tell me
l have a son l don't even remember?

30:08.010 --> 30:09.870
Please believe me.
You have to believe me.

30:10.010 --> 30:12.600
l used up all my wishes,
but the genie was too smart for me.

30:13.410 --> 30:15.280
Genies are sneaky.

30:15.420 --> 30:18.910
You have to help me.
You can't let him be invisible forever.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.820
l grew up with him.
He may be dorky and annoying,

30:21.960 --> 30:27.220
but he's fun and gullible to pull pranks on,
and he's my brother. l need him back.

30:27.730 --> 30:29.630
You know what, honey?

30:29.930 --> 30:33.730
l think l believe you.
You really love your brother.

30:33.870 --> 30:35.560
You love him too.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.670
And sometimes more than her.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.360
l'm trying to help you here.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.840
We have to do something.

30:43.980 --> 30:46.570
Honey, l believe you too, okay?

30:46.710 --> 30:50.080
But what am l gonna do?
The genie outsmarted you.

30:52.620 --> 30:54.250
Justin, l'm sorry.

30:56.320 --> 30:59.380
But l'm happy l have another son.

30:59.530 --> 31:01.220
Let me have a hug.

31:01.360 --> 31:05.060
- Well, yeah. Go put some clothes on first.
- l'll be right back.

31:14.670 --> 31:16.570
Floating pillow.

31:16.910 --> 31:19.570
You've gotta teach me that one
so l can sleep standing up.

31:20.580 --> 31:21.640
You know what?

31:21.780 --> 31:25.720
The genie may have outsmarted me,
but maybe we can out-dumb her.

31:25.850 --> 31:28.480
Max, how would you get a genie
to come back to her lamp?

31:28.920 --> 31:30.950
l know. Orange soda.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.420
What?

31:32.560 --> 31:36.720
lf someone poured orange soda
in my room, l'd be really mad.

31:36.900 --> 31:38.960
You spilled orange soda in your room,
didn't you?

31:39.100 --> 31:40.790
What did we say
about taking that up there?

31:42.100 --> 31:45.090
See? She's really mad
and she's going to my room.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.700
ls it working? ls it working?
lt's not working.

31:58.220 --> 32:01.420
What are you doing? That's my house.

32:01.550 --> 32:05.180
See? Nothing drives the ladies mad
like orange soda.

32:06.960 --> 32:11.060
l'll stop shaking it if you give Max a wish.
lt's just gonna get foamier in here.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.360
Fine. What do you want?

32:14.730 --> 32:18.190
l wish for this haircut
and a shirt like this.

32:18.940 --> 32:23.270
l can't give you a wish you already have.
What game are you playing, kid?

32:23.410 --> 32:26.110
Oh, yeah? l wish for the genie game.

32:27.050 --> 32:29.110
What genie game?

32:29.250 --> 32:32.380
- What are you trying to do?
- Oh, you know what l'm trying to do.

32:32.520 --> 32:36.220
Well, it sounds like you're trying to find out
about the reset button.

32:37.460 --> 32:39.950
Max, there's a reset button.
You know what to wish for.

32:40.090 --> 32:42.360
Swimming pool of pudding? Yes.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.360
No. The reset button.

32:46.470 --> 32:48.460
l wish you would show me
the reset button.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.160
- ln your lamp.
- ln your lamp.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.670
lf there's a reset button,
we'll need this paperclip.

32:55.070 --> 32:56.740
Hi.

33:02.550 --> 33:04.410
Orangey.

33:05.690 --> 33:07.450
Max.

33:07.950 --> 33:09.820
l got it.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.890
All right. Here it is.

33:15.030 --> 33:18.590
When you press it, it undoes
all the wishes since the last save,

33:18.730 --> 33:20.290
as if they'd never happened.

33:31.110 --> 33:34.510
- That was close.
- You're back. l'm so glad l can see you.

33:34.650 --> 33:37.670
Oh, Justin, sweetie,
l'm so sorry l forgot you.

33:37.820 --> 33:40.150
What kind of mother
forgets her own son?

33:41.290 --> 33:43.450
- What about you?
- What? l'm a dad.

33:43.590 --> 33:46.460
Before my cup of coffee,
l'm lucky if l remember one of these kids.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.990
Come on, Bobby. Bedtime.

33:53.170 --> 33:56.830
So you were pretty upset
about me being invisible, huh?

33:57.940 --> 34:02.240
No. l was just afraid that l would be
running into you all the time.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.510
No, you weren't.

34:05.350 --> 34:07.580
l need my brother back.

34:08.350 --> 34:11.650
l need my brother back. Where is he?

34:11.780 --> 34:15.409
Yeah, l'm glad you're back.
That way l can do this.

34:15.860 --> 34:16.909
l miss my--

34:17.060 --> 34:20.420
l miss my brother. He's so athletic.
