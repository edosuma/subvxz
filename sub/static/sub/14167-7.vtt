00:48.195 --> 00:50.354
Put your hands up! Put your hands up.

00:50.390 --> 00:51.506
Fuck you, man.

00:51.717 --> 00:53.860
Man, I didn't do nothing, man.

00:53.894 --> 00:54.928
Back off!

00:54.962 --> 00:56.529
- Look, man, I'm cooperating.
- Oh, shit.

00:56.563 --> 00:58.164
You ain't got fucking nothing on us.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.597
Seems like this guy,
Michael, is a real dickhead.

03:22.639 --> 03:25.206
I knew a guy like him in ROTC.

03:25.241 --> 03:26.630
He'd find the runt in the group

03:26.643 --> 03:28.624
and then just hassle the shit out of him

03:28.642 --> 03:30.126
- till he broke.
- Hmm.

03:30.246 --> 03:33.382
Well, obviously he can't stay
at this facility any longer.

03:33.416 --> 03:34.750
Thank you.

03:35.894 --> 03:38.253
You don't see any way of
making this work, Ryan?

03:38.288 --> 03:40.288
No, sir. I... I don't.

03:40.322 --> 03:41.823
I've been checking in with Carl.

03:41.857 --> 03:43.121
He says you're doing good.

03:43.159 --> 03:44.914
He loves you. You got momentum.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.328
I hate to rock the boat here.

03:47.362 --> 03:49.332
Well, the problem, Mr. Dantzler,

03:49.359 --> 03:51.699
is that Michael had a lot
of friends at the house.

03:52.176 --> 03:55.259
At some point, they're gonna come after me,

03:55.717 --> 03:57.738
and I just don't want
to be put in a position

03:57.765 --> 04:01.164
where I have to defend
myself, 'cause I will.

04:02.824 --> 04:05.335
So the idea, then, is he moves in with you?

04:05.357 --> 04:07.969
Well, I think it's better than
moving him to another facility.

04:08.089 --> 04:10.019
And, uh, he's proven himself,

04:10.055 --> 04:12.406
so maybe it's time for
that next step, you know.

04:14.226 --> 04:16.612
I gonna have a hard time
finding a bed on short notice,

04:17.171 --> 04:20.755
and who knows how he's even
gonna mesh with a new group.

04:23.473 --> 04:25.886
If I do this, you understand
you're bound by the same rules.

04:25.887 --> 04:28.265
Urine test, mandatory
employment at Rat Reapers,

04:28.311 --> 04:31.027
- and all that.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

04:35.531 --> 04:38.366
All right, we'll give it a go. Hang tight.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.613
We got some paperwork and
shit we need to fill out.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.872
Oh, shit.

04:43.909 --> 04:47.178
- What happened?
- Hey, is it stripped?

04:47.379 --> 04:49.309
- Yeah.
- Let me see.

04:49.574 --> 04:51.531
What does that mean? They're stuck?

04:53.216 --> 04:54.248
Why don't we just leave them up?

04:54.368 --> 04:56.051
Thought the world was full of nihilists.

04:56.085 --> 04:57.147
I don't know where you got that idea,

04:57.156 --> 04:58.720
but these are ugly and I want them gone.

04:58.754 --> 05:00.555
No, we'll take care of it,
mom. We'll get them down.

05:00.589 --> 05:02.157
Not if the screws are stripped.

05:02.191 --> 05:03.431
No, we'll figure it out.

05:03.551 --> 05:06.294
No, it has to happen
today, Jay. You promised.

05:06.328 --> 05:08.435
Fine. Hey, mom, we're taking them off.

05:08.453 --> 05:09.681
Damn it, you can't get them off, Jay.

05:09.703 --> 05:10.799
I don't know how you're gonna do it.

05:10.833 --> 05:12.114
We're gonna figure it out, mom.

05:12.161 --> 05:14.334
- Hey.
- You can't! You can't do it!

05:18.931 --> 05:20.742
Keep your hands up.

05:23.715 --> 05:25.169
Garo.

05:25.508 --> 05:26.747
There's the queen bee.

05:26.781 --> 05:28.002
What are you doing here?

05:28.013 --> 05:29.085
I was in the neighborhood.

05:29.114 --> 05:30.355
I didn't know you were coming back.

05:30.475 --> 05:31.834
Where is everyone?

05:32.813 --> 05:34.855
Alvey and Ryan are on a training run.

05:34.889 --> 05:35.822
Around here?

05:35.828 --> 05:37.508
No, Topanga.

05:37.519 --> 05:39.100
Or maybe Solstice Canyon.

05:39.129 --> 05:40.850
Or maybe none of your fucking business.

05:40.879 --> 05:43.330
Listen, can I talk to you
just for a second, please?

05:43.364 --> 05:44.784
- Please, please?
- Of course.

05:44.825 --> 05:46.533
Give me something. Just give me something.

05:46.568 --> 05:49.261
- How's Ryan doing?
- Ryan's fine.

05:49.519 --> 05:51.351
- Everything's under control.
- Says you.

05:51.372 --> 05:53.277
I have a card I have to promote, okay.

05:53.294 --> 05:54.795
I'm doing a press event
in a couple of days.

05:54.825 --> 05:55.870
I want Alvey and him to be there.

05:55.876 --> 05:57.869
You know, I get it. I
completely understand.

05:57.878 --> 06:00.315
Man, I tell you, it's like
spinning plates all the time.

06:00.356 --> 06:02.012
- Nothing ever works out, you know.
- I do.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.331
First, they change my venue.

06:03.382 --> 06:05.383
Fucking nightmare. Then
I get a call last night.

06:05.413 --> 06:07.456
One of my fighters... he cut
his hands doing the dishes.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.254
The dishes... so he says.

06:09.289 --> 06:11.056
Severed a nerve. He's out.

06:11.261 --> 06:13.316
Which is another thing I
have to talk to Alvey about.

06:13.345 --> 06:14.594
I need a 155'er.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.044
You have anybody who's ready to go?

06:16.067 --> 06:18.297
- Like, how's Nate doing?
- Nate's out still.

06:18.315 --> 06:19.175
Yeah, of course, of course.

06:19.228 --> 06:20.750
But Jay's available.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.149
Alvey never mentioned that.

06:23.179 --> 06:24.368
You know how they are.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.381
- I'm handling him.
- Can I talk to him?

06:26.434 --> 06:27.639
Yeah, I'll set it up.

06:28.061 --> 06:29.963
Thank you.

06:30.276 --> 06:32.250
See you soon.

06:32.552 --> 06:34.313
You all set?

06:35.186 --> 06:37.170
Yeah, I think so.

06:37.582 --> 06:39.201
That's it? One box?

06:39.819 --> 06:41.153
Yeah, plus those.

06:43.990 --> 06:45.456
"Keith."

06:45.491 --> 06:47.291
You're taking his shit, too?

06:47.326 --> 06:49.628
Yeah. I don't know what else to do with it.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.659
Fucking leave it here.

06:51.687 --> 06:54.432
No. They'll throw it away.

06:54.466 --> 06:56.031
Let his family claim it.

06:56.415 --> 06:58.162
He doesn't have any family.

06:58.282 --> 06:59.909
He doesn't have any family?

07:00.119 --> 07:02.243
He doesn't have any family.

07:03.201 --> 07:05.146
All right, let's load it up.

07:11.019 --> 07:11.986
Hey.

07:16.911 --> 07:19.436
Nate must think I'm nuts.

07:19.556 --> 07:22.329
No. He's worried about you.

07:22.363 --> 07:25.519
- So am I.
- Don't be.

07:29.137 --> 07:30.220
Mom.

07:30.340 --> 07:34.241
I'm an emotional person,
as you may have noticed.

07:34.930 --> 07:37.144
And now that I'm clean,

07:37.178 --> 07:39.536
my moods are dialed up to, like, 11.

07:39.559 --> 07:41.047
There's gonna be some crying.

07:41.468 --> 07:43.450
Yeah, maybe the crying is good for you.

07:44.629 --> 07:45.852
It is.

07:51.091 --> 07:52.725
I know what you did for me.

07:54.231 --> 07:55.695
Mom.

07:55.729 --> 07:58.564
No one's ever cared
enough about me to do that.

08:00.868 --> 08:02.920
You could have easily have left me,

08:03.698 --> 08:06.085
like everyone else.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.701
But I didn't.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.838
And you're here now.

08:14.527 --> 08:15.881
I am.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.188
And I want those bars off the window.

08:23.222 --> 08:26.610
Them I'm-a rip those bars
off with my fucking teeth,

08:26.656 --> 08:28.156
okay?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.744
They're coming off.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.933
- Let's do something.
- Yeah.

08:35.253 --> 08:38.142
- Like what?
- I don't know. Um...

08:39.825 --> 08:41.506
Oh! Let's go shopping.

08:41.508 --> 08:42.971
- Shopping?
- Let's buy some clothes.

08:43.009 --> 08:45.825
- I want to burn all this shit.
- Okay.

08:45.843 --> 08:48.093
Get some stuff for this
house so it won't be so bleak.

08:48.103 --> 08:51.020
- Mom, this house is not bleak.
- It's bleak.

08:51.140 --> 08:53.215
- It's a very inspiring home.
- We need some pretty.

08:53.545 --> 08:55.753
Mom, I don't have a lot of money.

08:55.787 --> 08:57.922
You have a little, and I have a little.

08:57.956 --> 08:58.923
We'll find stuff.

08:58.957 --> 09:00.691
Come on... you, me, and Nate.

09:00.726 --> 09:02.754
You guys can take off jumping jacks

09:02.783 --> 09:04.206
- for one day for your mother.
- Oh, jumping jacks?

09:04.253 --> 09:06.612
Yes, mom. Mama wants a brand-new bag,

09:06.646 --> 09:08.821
mama's getting a shopping spree, okay?

09:08.941 --> 09:10.853
Come on.

09:10.973 --> 09:14.631
Hey! Get your asses off the couch.

09:14.647 --> 09:16.798
I told you sweaty bastards.

09:17.381 --> 09:19.450
You're sleeping on the
man's b... look what you did.

09:19.570 --> 09:21.947
Animals. We'll clean it up.

09:21.993 --> 09:24.021
We'll put some sheets down.
It'll be just like it was.

09:24.055 --> 09:25.298
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Hey.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.673
Oh, here's sheets and
blankets and a pillow.

09:27.703 --> 09:28.703
Look at this.

09:28.737 --> 09:30.204
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.074
Um, if you need anything, just let us know.

09:34.076 --> 09:36.645
No, this is... no, this looks great.

09:37.066 --> 09:39.443
Yeah, I mean, we'll make this your home

09:39.462 --> 09:41.449
until we can figure out
what the hell to do with you.

09:41.483 --> 09:42.716
All right?

09:42.750 --> 09:45.419
This is more than enough. Thank you.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.253
Yeah.

09:47.288 --> 09:48.633
Okay, well, what do you want to do?

09:48.651 --> 09:49.923
You want to train? I
mean, where's your head?

09:49.958 --> 09:51.021
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

09:51.045 --> 09:52.374
- You sure?
- Yeah, let's hit it. Yeah.

09:52.702 --> 09:54.393
- Let's bang it out.
- Let's go put your gear on.

09:58.661 --> 09:59.691
How's he seem?

09:59.732 --> 10:00.869
Strange.

10:02.232 --> 10:05.739
I don't know. He's carrying
around Keith the Ripper's boxes.

10:06.020 --> 10:06.991
They were friends.

10:07.038 --> 10:09.022
- I understand.
- Alvey.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.194
Garo stopped by.

10:11.551 --> 10:14.026
- What'd he want?
- He wants to promote his fight.

10:14.061 --> 10:15.531
He wants you to call him.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.830
Okay.

10:18.763 --> 10:21.634
Fucking life. All right, I will.

10:21.754 --> 10:22.969
Have you talked to her yet?

10:24.418 --> 10:25.617
No.

10:26.261 --> 10:27.297
I doubt I will.

10:27.417 --> 10:28.719
She's probably gonna float away.

10:28.755 --> 10:31.123
Watch. I know this woman.

10:31.683 --> 10:35.003
You should. You've been
married to her for 26 years.

10:37.997 --> 10:39.398
That's a great pillow.

10:41.918 --> 10:45.220
Nate, I'm rethinking everything,

10:45.340 --> 10:48.631
the whole wardrobe. No
more t-shirts... ever.

10:49.025 --> 10:51.210
I'm suits from now on.

10:51.247 --> 10:54.612
I don't care if it's
100 fucking degrees out.

10:55.162 --> 10:58.149
And I listen to vinyl.

11:01.647 --> 11:03.221
Look at this, huh?

11:03.255 --> 11:05.909
Hmm? Taking a peek?

11:06.859 --> 11:08.526
The only blemish.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.300
Perfect condition.

11:10.762 --> 11:12.312
That's a terrible suit.

11:12.348 --> 11:13.764
You're gonna get used to it.

11:14.177 --> 11:15.586
What are you doing, huh?

11:15.706 --> 11:17.973
- You're looking at plates?
- Stop.

11:18.202 --> 11:19.839
There's a whole store here, Nate.

11:19.959 --> 11:21.357
What do you think?

11:23.007 --> 11:24.687
Wow.

11:25.009 --> 11:27.147
It's great. I love it.

11:28.089 --> 11:29.470
Not too shabby, huh?

11:29.498 --> 11:31.281
Yeah, it's really nice.

11:31.757 --> 11:33.531
I'll take what I can get.

11:34.219 --> 11:35.726
I love this suit.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.085
- Thanks.
- Did you find something?

11:39.129 --> 11:40.168
Nah, I'm good.

11:40.707 --> 11:42.838
- No, you have to.
- You got to buy something.

11:42.883 --> 11:45.228
I don't... I don't like
wearing other people's clothes.

11:45.263 --> 11:47.163
We're gonna wash them.

11:48.197 --> 11:49.066
Go.

11:49.304 --> 11:51.608
You have to find something. We're
not leaving here till you do.

11:51.674 --> 11:53.764
Maybe some plates. There's
some plates right over there.

11:53.770 --> 11:55.872
You come here. I want to show you more.

11:58.375 --> 12:00.409
Come on, move, move.

12:00.449 --> 12:02.044
Angle out. Angle out and hit.

12:02.164 --> 12:03.279
Angle out and hit.

12:03.313 --> 12:04.346
You're squared up.

12:04.381 --> 12:05.381
Come on. Lead punch.

12:05.415 --> 12:08.050
Snap your jab. Snap your jab.

12:08.085 --> 12:09.385
Back to your chin.

12:09.419 --> 12:11.654
What are you doing with that right hand?

12:11.688 --> 12:13.355
Good, good. Come on, come on. Hands up.

12:15.358 --> 12:17.559
Hands up!

12:17.594 --> 12:20.084
What'd I tell you? On the cheekbone.

12:20.830 --> 12:23.632
Good! Body.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.033
Don't leave those punches out there.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.335
Good, good, good. Nice!

12:26.369 --> 12:27.703
Break his body.

12:27.737 --> 12:30.071
Hands up, hands up. Hands up.

12:30.106 --> 12:32.007
Get your hands up. What are you doing?

12:32.041 --> 12:34.475
Angle out. Get off the cage.

12:34.510 --> 12:36.912
Get your arms up. Get off the cage.

12:36.946 --> 12:38.146
Cover up. Come on.

12:38.181 --> 12:41.616
Work the body, Joe. Work the body.

12:41.650 --> 12:42.750
10 seconds left.

12:42.785 --> 12:45.020
What are you doing? Turn the music off.

12:45.054 --> 12:46.087
That's great.

12:46.122 --> 12:48.222
Come on, that's it, Joe.

12:48.256 --> 12:50.758
Come over here. Come here.

12:50.793 --> 12:52.033
Come over here.

12:52.033 --> 12:54.054
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

12:54.090 --> 12:55.363
Come on, what was that? What are you doing?

12:55.397 --> 12:57.050
Joe's a fucking good
fighter. That's what it is.

12:57.065 --> 12:58.187
Oh, he's a fucking great fighter.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.701
I'm talking about you. What are you doing?

12:59.821 --> 13:00.786
He's a good fighter.

13:00.810 --> 13:01.732
I know he's a good fighter.

13:02.852 --> 13:03.821
What are you doing?

13:04.776 --> 13:05.940
- Get out.
- I'm still working.

13:05.974 --> 13:07.074
I'm still working, man.

13:07.108 --> 13:08.108
Let him go. Get out.

13:08.143 --> 13:09.243
No, I'm not done training!

13:09.277 --> 13:10.577
- You're done. Take a break.
- No, I'm not.

13:10.981 --> 13:12.279
I said, "take a break."

13:12.314 --> 13:13.435
I'm training right now.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.144
I don't want a fucking
break. I want another round.

13:15.172 --> 13:17.107
- I said, "take a break"!
- Put another round up!

13:17.126 --> 13:18.662
You're fucking done for the day.

13:28.796 --> 13:31.452
Get out of my cage. Get out.

13:31.461 --> 13:34.099
I don't know what the fuck
you're doing, man. Come on.

13:36.404 --> 13:38.404
Waste a fucking day.

13:44.443 --> 13:46.913
Oh, please, you've got to be kidding me.

13:48.182 --> 13:49.415
Hello, Nate?

13:50.150 --> 13:51.687
Hey.

13:52.784 --> 13:53.753
It's Jacob.

13:54.586 --> 13:55.785
Oh, my God, blast from the past.

13:55.803 --> 13:57.175
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

13:57.193 --> 13:58.424
How are you?

13:58.458 --> 14:00.459
I'm good, thanks.

14:00.796 --> 14:04.418
I'm good, too. Thanks for asking.

14:04.538 --> 14:06.741
Hey, Nate. We're on the move.

14:06.861 --> 14:08.534
Let's go.

14:11.616 --> 14:13.756
It was good seeing you anyways.

14:19.034 --> 14:20.913
Who was that guy?

14:20.947 --> 14:22.614
Just some dude from high school.

14:23.095 --> 14:25.017
Hipsters, huh?

14:25.051 --> 14:26.826
Stealing clothes from the poor.

14:26.863 --> 14:29.788
Aah!

14:37.710 --> 14:39.960
Damn it. You almost hit her.

14:40.179 --> 14:42.700
- Get in the fucking car!
- I'm trying!

14:42.735 --> 14:45.662
- Get in the fucking car.
- Hey, hey, Nate. Hey, hey.

14:45.699 --> 14:47.604
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's an accident.

14:47.639 --> 14:49.640
Nobody got hurt, right?

14:50.017 --> 14:51.656
You okay?

14:51.776 --> 14:54.312
Why don't you get in? There you go.

14:54.346 --> 14:55.646
You're all right.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.727
You don't need to honk the horn that long,

14:57.773 --> 14:59.703
you know. It's grating.

15:00.115 --> 15:02.853
You just tap it.

15:03.563 --> 15:06.122
A little bit goes a long way, right?

15:07.692 --> 15:08.867
You okay?

15:09.193 --> 15:11.495
Everybody's all right. Everybody's okay.

15:11.529 --> 15:13.057
Come on, mom.

15:13.505 --> 15:15.023
Let's go.

15:15.124 --> 15:18.325
We're going home. Come on. All right.

15:21.738 --> 15:25.308
So, you push in the
code, and it's disarmed.

15:25.343 --> 15:28.059
You push in the code
again and then hit "stay."

15:28.093 --> 15:29.520
It's armed.

15:29.640 --> 15:30.513
Got it?

15:30.547 --> 15:31.762
- Got it.
- Okay.

15:31.788 --> 15:33.182
What was the... what's the code?

15:33.302 --> 15:35.332
Uh, 0-5-2-9.

15:35.337 --> 15:36.318
May 29th.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.320
Oh. What was May 29th?

15:39.544 --> 15:43.230
Okay, so, um, Alvey had this pet ocelot

15:43.275 --> 15:45.388
named Kima back in his 20s.

15:45.428 --> 15:46.751
Before we were born.

15:46.778 --> 15:48.708
Right.

15:49.156 --> 15:53.583
Yeah, so, you know, uh,
that's the day she was born.

15:53.611 --> 15:55.788
Or maybe that's the day
that she was put down

15:55.825 --> 15:57.906
because she ate a $2,000 parrot.

15:57.940 --> 15:59.674
Oh. Shit.

15:59.709 --> 16:00.708
- Yeah.
- That'll do it.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.747
Mm. Yet he's never forgotten her.

16:02.756 --> 16:05.281
- Huh.
- Forgotten who?

16:05.519 --> 16:08.116
Kima. I was just giving him the code.

16:08.150 --> 16:09.918
Oh, my girl, Kima.

16:09.952 --> 16:11.381
Fucking ocelots, man.

16:11.427 --> 16:13.357
Never have a pet ocelot. Pain in the ass.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.423
I wasn't planning on it.

16:15.457 --> 16:16.952
So, you gonna be okay here?

16:17.072 --> 16:18.359
Uh, yeah, yeah.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.312
Yeah? You sure?

16:19.349 --> 16:21.946
Yeah, lock me up, wake me
up when it's time to train.

16:21.965 --> 16:24.627
- Okay.
- I'm not locking you in.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.593
I'll give you a key.

16:26.713 --> 16:29.420
- Yeah.
- Here.

16:33.008 --> 16:34.708
Yeah. You ready?

16:34.743 --> 16:36.177
Yeah.

16:36.211 --> 16:38.012
All right. Go at it.

16:38.047 --> 16:39.813
- All right.
- See you.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.997
- Don't lose that key.
- No.

16:44.152 --> 16:46.921
Dinner is served.

16:49.765 --> 16:53.524
Um, so, should we say grace before...

16:53.644 --> 16:54.951
we eat? I don't know.

16:55.071 --> 16:58.065
Nah. God is within us. Let's eat.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.733
What does that mean, "God is within us"?

17:00.768 --> 17:01.775
Nothing.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.348
I'm sorry. Do you want to pray?

17:03.778 --> 17:05.605
Are we not Catholic?

17:06.839 --> 17:09.859
I've never been Catholic.

17:10.711 --> 17:11.882
Dad is.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.409
Um...

17:18.357 --> 17:19.336
Okay,

17:20.387 --> 17:23.056
I got a message from Lisa. Good news.

17:23.089 --> 17:25.042
Looks like I got another fight.

17:25.826 --> 17:27.667
Lisa... your dad's Lisa?

17:30.363 --> 17:32.764
Yeah.

17:32.799 --> 17:34.316
She's, um...

17:34.709 --> 17:37.882
like, managing me. I mean, we
haven't quite figured it out, but...

17:38.952 --> 17:41.111
I mean, I'm getting back in the cage,

17:41.147 --> 17:43.617
and that's... that's what's
important, right, Nate?

17:44.010 --> 17:46.344
Well, what's she like, anyway?

17:48.247 --> 17:49.708
Don't be weird about it.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.144
I'm not being weird. I...

17:51.162 --> 17:53.318
I've been out of circulation.

17:53.352 --> 17:57.756
There are things I need to know,
things I need to get used to.

17:57.790 --> 18:00.391
I didn't even know Nate
was such a Catholic.

18:00.426 --> 18:01.759
I'm not.

18:03.929 --> 18:05.961
I'm kidding!

18:06.848 --> 18:09.418
Okay, come on. Relax, you guys. Here,

18:09.538 --> 18:11.002
let's have a toast.

18:12.304 --> 18:13.690
To family dinners.

18:13.992 --> 18:15.245
We should do this twice a week.

18:15.272 --> 18:17.275
Yes, indeed.

19:09.095 --> 19:10.951
Whoo!

20:22.021 --> 20:23.482
Come on.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.688
No, thanks.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.158
Aw, come on. Dance with us.

20:28.412 --> 20:30.543
You never even learned, did you?

20:33.479 --> 20:34.960
Should you be drinking?

20:34.997 --> 20:36.423
Yeah, well, you know, with me,

20:36.467 --> 20:39.076
it's not so much the
wine as it is the heroin.

20:44.235 --> 20:46.143
Join the party, Nate.

20:48.021 --> 20:49.379
All right.

21:01.122 --> 21:02.403
Come on.

21:02.961 --> 21:05.295
I'm gonna teach you to waltz.

21:07.164 --> 21:09.465
Okay. One hand there.

21:09.499 --> 21:10.963
Hold a frame.

21:11.083 --> 21:14.604
One, two, three, one, two, three.

21:14.638 --> 21:17.147
One, two, three, go.

21:22.312 --> 21:24.390
You look great.

21:31.988 --> 21:34.490
Oh, fancy.

21:40.797 --> 21:42.931
- You talk to Garo yet?
- Yep.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.529
He's off the fucking ledge.

21:46.178 --> 21:48.904
I told him Ryan would be ready
for press in a week or so.

21:49.196 --> 21:50.806
Will he?

21:50.840 --> 21:52.928
I'll tell you in a week or so.

21:54.958 --> 21:56.897
I think I'm gonna get Jay on the card.

21:56.933 --> 21:58.726
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:58.744 --> 22:00.638
Garo mentioned that.

22:03.685 --> 22:05.253
What?

22:05.287 --> 22:08.146
No, that's... that's good. That's good.

22:09.057 --> 22:10.992
Yeah. I mean, I hope it works out for you.

22:15.130 --> 22:17.679
You coming to bed?

22:18.054 --> 22:20.084
No. No, I'm on a loop.

22:20.359 --> 22:22.435
Maybe in a bit.

22:24.906 --> 22:26.369
A bit.

22:37.952 --> 22:39.946
Sorry.

22:42.681 --> 22:46.038
They gave me some stuff,

22:46.394 --> 22:48.388
and now it's just, like...

22:49.459 --> 22:51.370
cobwebs.

22:55.536 --> 22:58.093
What's the stuff for pancakes?

22:59.406 --> 23:01.440
What?

23:02.986 --> 23:05.144
The stuff for pancakes that makes...

23:05.190 --> 23:07.130
makes the pancakes brown.

23:08.941 --> 23:10.404
Syrup?

23:10.524 --> 23:12.288
Yes.

23:12.786 --> 23:14.007
Molasses.

23:14.766 --> 23:16.824
It feels like

23:17.172 --> 23:19.405
I'm covered in molasses.

23:19.525 --> 23:24.396
And it got on my brain.

23:25.056 --> 23:26.631
What did they give you?

23:30.187 --> 23:31.394
Can't...

23:32.501 --> 23:34.431
can't remember.

23:34.551 --> 23:37.522
But I was freaking out when
they brought me in here, so

23:38.647 --> 23:40.178
they had to.

23:43.516 --> 23:45.483
Hey, look who I got.

23:56.008 --> 23:58.121
I can't have him yet.

23:59.557 --> 24:01.265
I'm not stable.

24:06.088 --> 24:08.539
I'll, uh... I'll hold on to him for you.

24:08.567 --> 24:12.902
Just talk to him sometimes.

24:13.778 --> 24:16.606
Of course. Yeah.

24:17.681 --> 24:19.990
You'll get out of here, man.
You'll be able to talk to him.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.619
You know, just...

24:22.552 --> 24:26.375
just don't say anything to
anyone except your lawyer, right?

24:27.875 --> 24:29.058
Keith?

24:29.092 --> 24:30.393
Huh?

24:30.427 --> 24:31.873
You have a lawyer?

24:34.131 --> 24:36.335
- Do you have a lawyer?
- Do...

24:37.223 --> 24:38.878
I talked

24:39.345 --> 24:41.448
to some guy

24:42.052 --> 24:45.055
who's... who's a lawyer.

24:46.724 --> 24:48.087
Good.

24:48.444 --> 24:49.926
Well,

24:51.133 --> 24:54.096
you just say, uh...

24:54.462 --> 24:56.438
all you got to do is say, uh,

24:56.749 --> 24:58.606
Michael came after you,

24:59.090 --> 25:01.724
and you were defending yourself, right?

25:02.355 --> 25:04.249
Michael came after you,

25:04.285 --> 25:05.959
and you were defending

25:06.224 --> 25:07.733
both of us.

25:09.243 --> 25:11.593
Got it?

25:14.886 --> 25:17.638
Hey, did you have your fight yet?

25:20.676 --> 25:22.139
No.

25:23.045 --> 25:26.109
- No, man.
- Not for another few weeks.

25:26.557 --> 25:28.651
I'll be there.

25:35.302 --> 25:36.901
Bernard?

25:37.285 --> 25:41.136
Can people... can people
spend the night here?

25:41.557 --> 25:43.871
I don't think so, buddy.

25:50.052 --> 25:51.398
- Hey, there.
- Hi.

25:51.737 --> 25:52.888
What are you doing?

25:53.008 --> 25:55.605
Well, I found this in front
of your neighbor's yard,

25:55.651 --> 25:57.142
and it's a really nice piece.

25:57.169 --> 25:59.135
It just needs some new
paint. Do you want to help?

25:59.255 --> 26:02.562
Oh, yeah, I do. But I got to...
I got to go meet a promoter.

26:02.899 --> 26:04.699
You have to do that now?

26:04.733 --> 26:06.934
Yeah, but it's not gonna take too long,

26:07.218 --> 26:09.771
so I'll be able to come
back real soon and help you.

26:09.805 --> 26:12.056
And leave me with all the dirty work, huh?

26:13.942 --> 26:16.236
Nate's gonna be back pretty soon.

26:17.646 --> 26:19.580
It's okay, Jay. Go.

26:20.032 --> 26:21.916
There's some paint around the back

26:21.950 --> 26:23.764
if you want to go look. We
have whole bunch of cans.

26:23.884 --> 26:26.370
- Perfect.
- Yeah, lots of different colors.

26:28.523 --> 26:31.704
- Mom, hey. Give me a hug.
- I got this stuff all over me.

26:36.945 --> 26:39.048
Okay.

26:43.664 --> 26:46.366
I stopped taking everything a few days ago.

26:47.197 --> 26:50.437
You know, Doc, I always
tell my fighters every day

26:50.471 --> 26:54.423
"Don't be afraid of
greatness. Bet on yourself."

26:55.776 --> 26:57.981
Sometimes that makes people
uncomfortable, you know,

26:58.000 --> 26:59.527
'cause when you bet on yourself,

26:59.914 --> 27:01.580
they think you're a little crazy.

27:02.225 --> 27:03.697
Makes them... makes them

27:03.706 --> 27:06.816
uncomfortable. Makes them... afraid.

27:07.388 --> 27:08.773
I'm always reading about great men

27:08.819 --> 27:11.060
who had a mother or a father or a wife

27:11.454 --> 27:13.796
or a fucking doctor telling
them "take the medication

27:13.827 --> 27:15.442
so we don't have to
fucking worry about you.

27:15.469 --> 27:17.396
We don't want to worry."

27:17.431 --> 27:19.064
You got to shut that out.

27:21.122 --> 27:23.335
Great men don't take pills.

27:23.747 --> 27:25.777
They take chances.

27:26.628 --> 27:30.108
But for many of them,
things did not end well.

27:33.460 --> 27:36.359
I understand that. I...
I don't take it lightly.

27:37.137 --> 27:39.635
And I know... and I know
the highs are a little higher

27:39.680 --> 27:40.796
and the lows are a little lower,

27:40.796 --> 27:42.470
but I can... I can cope with that.

27:42.488 --> 27:43.741
I have a handle on that.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.824
But to coast right in the middle?

27:46.632 --> 27:47.793
No, man.

27:47.812 --> 27:49.312
That's the death of me.

27:50.107 --> 27:51.342
No bueno.

27:52.165 --> 27:55.065
Does Lisa know you've made this decision?

27:55.943 --> 27:57.342
No.

27:58.431 --> 28:00.371
Personal. This is personal.

28:08.213 --> 28:10.448
You sticking any needles in your arms?

28:11.145 --> 28:12.383
Nope.

28:12.417 --> 28:14.366
Any felonies coming down the pipe?

28:14.401 --> 28:16.825
Boy, Garo, I can't believe
this line of questioning.

28:16.945 --> 28:19.318
I have never been tried,
charged, convicted,

28:19.348 --> 28:21.157
or suspected of committing a crime.

28:21.192 --> 28:22.493
Fuck you.

28:22.527 --> 28:24.125
I've seen you commit at least 10 myself.

28:24.140 --> 28:25.501
I know. But, you know,

28:25.699 --> 28:27.865
no bullshit, man. I got
different priorities now.

28:27.899 --> 28:29.277
You got a kid coming?

28:29.409 --> 28:31.267
No. But, you know, you
can't fuck off forever.

28:31.387 --> 28:33.324
At some point, you really
got to do something serious,

28:33.353 --> 28:34.670
and I know where you're at right now.

28:34.705 --> 28:36.406
I mean, I'm on thin ice
with fucking everybody.

28:36.526 --> 28:39.060
But I'm giving you my
word, this is it, I'm in.

28:39.667 --> 28:40.943
It's the only thing I'm focused on.

28:40.978 --> 28:42.602
That's very pleasing for me to hear.

28:42.938 --> 28:44.580
You need to be fighting.

28:44.615 --> 28:46.383
That's why I'm here.

28:46.417 --> 28:47.498
Okay, then.

28:47.618 --> 28:49.772
I'm gonna give you the same deal

28:50.299 --> 28:52.311
I gave the last guy.

28:54.090 --> 28:55.472
Good for me.

28:55.809 --> 28:57.535
You sure you don't want
Lisa to take a look at this

28:57.594 --> 29:00.772
- before you sign?
- Nah. I trust you.

29:02.685 --> 29:04.258
How is Ryan coming along?

29:04.276 --> 29:05.766
Is he the same guy?

29:08.236 --> 29:11.080
Garo, I don't know what to tell you.

29:11.482 --> 29:14.443
He's exactly what you want him to be.

29:14.477 --> 29:16.339
How about that?

29:17.217 --> 29:19.481
What the fuck does that mean?

29:23.318 --> 29:25.353
Can I help you?

29:25.387 --> 29:27.607
There is a crazy woman by the front desk.

29:27.727 --> 29:29.005
Get rid of her.

29:29.006 --> 29:30.717
Or just get one of the guys to do it.

29:30.726 --> 29:32.436
Thing is, she's really pretty,

29:32.461 --> 29:35.893
and she says she's Alvey's wife.

29:42.671 --> 29:45.573
Hey, Lisa, can I just...

29:45.607 --> 29:47.717
Uh, just a second. I'll be right back.

29:53.014 --> 29:54.506
Christina?

29:54.918 --> 29:56.280
I'm Lisa.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.986
Oh, fuck. You're gorgeous.

29:59.509 --> 30:01.329
Jay and Nate have told me a lot about you,

30:01.348 --> 30:03.123
but I didn't know you were so young.

30:03.442 --> 30:05.893
Getting older every day.

30:07.165 --> 30:08.596
Is Alvey around?

30:08.716 --> 30:11.264
No. He's actually gone. He'll be back soon.

30:11.299 --> 30:13.333
Is there anything I can do for you?

30:13.642 --> 30:16.570
No. I need to talk to him.

30:17.585 --> 30:20.421
Well, he should be back
soon. You're welcome to wait.

30:21.598 --> 30:23.876
I don't want to get in the way.

30:27.799 --> 30:31.293
Oh, wow. This place is huge.

30:32.235 --> 30:35.766
You know what? I'm gonna call
Alvey and see where he's at.

30:42.462 --> 30:43.659
... go to to begin with.

30:43.697 --> 30:45.534
I haven't had one single drink,

30:45.654 --> 30:47.217
and immediately some dude

30:47.235 --> 30:49.275
spills a drink on my boyfriend, Josh.

30:50.272 --> 30:51.951
So then Josh grabs my water,

30:51.974 --> 30:53.940
and he throws it in the guy's face.

30:53.949 --> 30:55.422
Ugh. Jesus.

30:55.467 --> 30:57.376
So, of course we get kicked out.

30:57.410 --> 31:00.548
An hour in line. We were
in the club for a minute.

31:00.813 --> 31:02.781
And then we're out the door.

31:02.815 --> 31:04.957
And that was my Saturday night.

31:04.993 --> 31:07.371
And that's why I don't go out.

31:07.645 --> 31:09.081
You're a machine.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.322
You're way ahead of schedule.

31:12.291 --> 31:13.801
All right.

31:14.222 --> 31:17.529
- Same time next week?
- No, next week's no good.

31:17.563 --> 31:19.631
Okay. When's good?

31:20.258 --> 31:21.346
You know, actually, I think

31:21.365 --> 31:23.331
I'm gonna start training
with my dad again in the gym.

31:23.369 --> 31:25.102
Nate, I said you were ahead of schedule.

31:25.137 --> 31:26.716
I didn't say you could
get off the schedule.

31:26.753 --> 31:27.738
I feel good.

31:27.773 --> 31:29.574
And I'm happy for you,

31:29.853 --> 31:32.914
but you and I have a lot of work
together before you can train.

31:33.179 --> 31:35.127
When I say I'm done, I'm done.

31:38.750 --> 31:40.523
Do you have a problem with me, Nate?

31:40.981 --> 31:42.371
No.

31:42.627 --> 31:44.639
I won't take it personally.
I'll get you another therapist.

31:44.655 --> 31:46.112
Look, you're a great guy, all right?

31:46.123 --> 31:49.075
But I'm done stretching
and doing fucking pilates.

31:49.195 --> 31:51.490
I need to focus my
training back on fighting.

31:51.829 --> 31:53.830
You're putting yourself at risk.

31:53.864 --> 31:56.870
Yeah, no shit. I... I fight
in a cage for money.

32:25.069 --> 32:26.505
Hey.

32:27.950 --> 32:29.523
What are you doing here?

32:30.119 --> 32:32.634
I want to talk to you.

32:36.402 --> 32:38.791
All right. Um, yeah. I'll see you.

32:38.836 --> 32:41.676
Wednesday night is fine. Bye.

32:47.768 --> 32:49.908
You really did it, huh?

32:50.612 --> 32:53.760
- This place is amazing.
- Well, don't let the crowd fool you.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.599
Most of these guys can't pay.

32:55.719 --> 32:57.163
But still.

32:57.935 --> 33:00.081
It's a big deal.

33:00.938 --> 33:03.420
It's what you always talked about.

33:04.325 --> 33:07.416
You remember those plans
I sketched out for you.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.636
Yeah. Yeah, it was close.

33:14.251 --> 33:16.142
Lisa's nice.

33:16.262 --> 33:21.164
Seems like she, uh,
really is on top of things.

33:23.057 --> 33:25.196
Don't look at me like I'm crazy, Alvey.

33:25.198 --> 33:27.109
- It makes me crazy.
- I don't know how to look at you.

33:27.229 --> 33:28.244
I don't know how to talk to you.

33:28.271 --> 33:29.954
I don't know what you're doing.

33:30.074 --> 33:31.900
You show up at Jay and Nate's,

33:31.934 --> 33:33.969
- then you show up at my gym.
- Okay, stop, stop.

33:33.997 --> 33:35.094
Don't do your rant.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.271
My rant?

33:39.722 --> 33:41.409
What do you want, Christina?

33:42.374 --> 33:44.697
Well, first of all, I'm
sorry about the other night.

33:44.724 --> 33:45.721
Oh.

33:46.282 --> 33:49.105
Jay didn't even tell
me he invited you until

33:49.225 --> 33:50.925
right before.

33:51.190 --> 33:53.176
It's funny, but you didn't seem very sorry.

33:53.194 --> 33:56.002
You seemed like you were
really enjoying yourself.

33:57.676 --> 34:00.877
Well, it's always fun to
jump out of the shadows.

34:01.296 --> 34:03.664
I kind of liked the look on your face.

34:06.419 --> 34:08.788
I want to work something out.

34:08.908 --> 34:12.831
You have a life with
another woman. I have a life.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.643
I think we should resolve
things and move on.

34:18.279 --> 34:19.708
Move on?

34:19.829 --> 34:21.291
What? Don't you want to?

34:21.310 --> 34:24.618
I mean, Lisa must be
breathing down your neck.

34:24.652 --> 34:26.650
Eh, Lisa's fine.

34:27.755 --> 34:29.922
It can be painless.

34:30.282 --> 34:33.630
Um, no lawyers, no
drama. I don't want half.

34:33.659 --> 34:36.730
I just want to be free.

34:37.397 --> 34:39.099
Just free?

34:41.221 --> 34:42.702
Well, you think it over.

34:42.737 --> 34:46.004
I will do it any way you want.

34:47.632 --> 34:51.527
I'm at the boys' for a
while, so let me know.

34:55.717 --> 34:58.016
You should be proud of this place, Alvey.

34:58.051 --> 35:00.185
It's a big deal.

35:04.901 --> 35:06.354
I don't care what she said.

35:06.363 --> 35:07.461
You need a lawyer...

35:07.507 --> 35:09.665
and not a guy who
red-lines fight contracts.

35:09.683 --> 35:11.577
- I'm gonna call someone.
- When?

35:11.697 --> 35:13.452
When I know what the hell's going on.

35:13.488 --> 35:14.896
I know what the hell's going on.

35:14.906 --> 35:17.803
- Do you want me to call someone?
- No. I'm gonna fucking take care of it.

35:17.803 --> 35:19.065
Mm.

35:19.185 --> 35:21.306
Will you give me a
fucking second to breathe?

35:21.340 --> 35:22.513
I shut her down now,

35:22.513 --> 35:24.498
she's gonna know I got something
that's fucking worth something.

35:24.535 --> 35:25.916
She knows that you have something

35:25.925 --> 35:27.635
that's worth something, okay?

35:27.755 --> 35:30.443
She's just trying to find out how much.

35:30.489 --> 35:33.533
It's an asset. She's not
stupid. She gets half.

35:33.544 --> 35:35.465
I know what she gets.

35:39.818 --> 35:41.993
There's a reason you haven't divorced her.

35:42.027 --> 35:43.127
Oh, here we go.

35:43.162 --> 35:44.461
What's... what's that?

35:44.496 --> 35:45.882
What's that supposed to mean?

35:46.002 --> 35:47.832
It means that I know you

35:47.866 --> 35:51.186
and that every feeling
you've ever had is unresolved.

35:51.186 --> 35:53.766
Mm, and you read that from a fucking book

35:53.793 --> 35:55.083
and you don't believe a word of that.

35:55.119 --> 35:56.031
She's the mother of your children,

35:56.053 --> 35:57.150
- she doesn't...
- Yeah, she's the mother of my children.

35:57.187 --> 35:58.358
Yeah, no, no. She's the mother of my...

35:58.372 --> 35:59.847
what was I supposed to do? Huh?

36:00.072 --> 36:02.212
W... where was I supposed
to fucking find the woman?

36:02.246 --> 36:03.908
What was I supposed to do?
I didn't know where she was.

36:04.028 --> 36:05.852
What am I gonna do? Go
to some fucking whorehouse

36:05.884 --> 36:07.856
and pull her out and take the
fucking needle out of her hand

36:07.889 --> 36:09.452
and give her a fucking pen and say, "here.

36:09.499 --> 36:12.580
Fucking sign the divorce
papers, crackhead."

36:13.035 --> 36:13.971
Is that not fair?

36:13.985 --> 36:15.507
No, it's not fair. It's not fair.

36:15.544 --> 36:17.056
"Is that not fair?"

36:22.278 --> 36:25.167
She's in a place now where
I can talk to her maybe.

36:25.374 --> 36:27.816
I'm going to fucking handle this,

36:28.061 --> 36:29.999
but I'm gonna do it my way.

39:13.990 --> 39:15.790
Hel... hello?

39:15.824 --> 39:18.056
Yeah, yeah. This is him.

39:18.994 --> 39:20.443
No, no, no, no. No, no.

39:20.470 --> 39:23.223
You don't have to go down there.
That's okay. It's a false alarm.

39:23.497 --> 39:25.674
I'm sure.

39:25.794 --> 39:27.540
Kima.

39:27.841 --> 39:29.991
K-i-m-a... kima. Yeah.

39:30.878 --> 39:32.273
Yeah, I'm positive.

39:32.689 --> 39:34.709
All right, thank you. Thank you.

39:35.286 --> 39:36.292
Fuck.

39:36.412 --> 39:40.648
- Alarm company?
- Yeah. Ryan must've set it off.

39:41.067 --> 39:42.722
I told him the code.

39:42.759 --> 39:44.719
Mm, probably forgot.

39:52.856 --> 39:55.229
Fucking phone is off.

39:55.263 --> 39:57.565
I'm gonna go down there.

39:57.599 --> 40:00.867
No, babe. He knows the code.

40:01.637 --> 40:03.100
I know. I'm gonna get up now.

40:03.118 --> 40:04.600
Hey!

40:08.917 --> 40:10.600
Ryan!

40:11.908 --> 40:13.939
What the fuck?

40:14.707 --> 40:16.125
Fuck.

40:16.326 --> 40:18.420
Fuck.

40:19.097 --> 40:22.511
Ryan, where the fuck are you?! Ryan!

40:40.152 --> 40:41.515
Ryan!

40:41.533 --> 40:43.253
Sorry!

40:43.902 --> 40:45.722
I, uh...

40:45.933 --> 40:47.872
I left the machine on.

40:52.463 --> 40:53.953
What the fuck happened here, man?

40:54.073 --> 40:55.810
Training session, Coach.

40:55.844 --> 40:59.523
A tough one, but the juice
is worth the squeeze, man.

40:59.532 --> 41:01.252
You know what I'm saying? You know?

41:01.372 --> 41:03.785
By the way, I pissed in the cage,

41:04.386 --> 41:06.374
but I cleaned it up.

41:06.703 --> 41:09.490
- You pissed in my cage?
- Yeah, but I cleaned it up.

41:09.977 --> 41:12.359
You fucking pissed in my cage?

41:12.575 --> 41:15.694
You fucking pissed in my
cage, you motherfucker?

41:15.814 --> 41:18.446
What the fuck are you doing, dude?

41:18.767 --> 41:21.603
We both know how this really works, right?

41:21.987 --> 41:25.929
You bend to me, Coach.

41:26.207 --> 41:28.511
- Is that how this works?
- Not the other way.

41:28.709 --> 41:30.852
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Hey, don't blame me.

41:30.861 --> 41:32.645
You threw the steak in front of the cave.

Right?

41:36.139 --> 41:38.899
You got something you want to
say to me, you fucking cunt?

41:39.492 --> 41:41.157
This shit was over

41:41.431 --> 41:43.489

42:58.161 --> 42:59.930
That's it.

My boy's ready.

43:51.337 --> 43:53.749
Who the fuck are you guys?

43:56.240 --> 43:58.920
You want to tell me why the fuck

Yo, Jay, what are you doing?

44:36.729 --> 44:39.168
