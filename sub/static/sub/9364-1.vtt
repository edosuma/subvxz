28:55.400 --> 28:57.818
that looked more natural
to fall out of it a certain way,

28:57.819 --> 29:00.237
then he would keep it.

29:00.238 --> 29:02.948
And he allowed
the three of us Firebirds

29:02.949 --> 29:04.783
to have our own versions

29:04.784 --> 29:08.871
so that it suited our bodies
and abilities best.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.998
- ln a company of 80 dancers

29:10.999 --> 29:13.208
where you've got
a lot of stars--

29:13.209 --> 29:15.878
and he could have
picked anyone--

29:15.879 --> 29:17.838
for him to pick someone

29:17.839 --> 29:21.467
who's not a prima ballerina
but a soloist

29:21.468 --> 29:24.762
and then to pick
someone black--

29:24.763 --> 29:27.306
a ballet of this magnitude,

29:27.307 --> 29:29.099
if we look
in the annals of ballet

29:29.100 --> 29:31.685
going back to Louis xlv,

29:31.686 --> 29:33.771
it's never happened before.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.315
It is--it's monumental.

29:36.316 --> 29:39.485
The entire dance world
was agog,

29:39.486 --> 29:41.695
and certainIy
every person of coIor

29:41.696 --> 29:44.698
invoIved in the dance world
was standing up and cheering,

29:44.699 --> 29:46.867
because we'd been
waiting for this moment.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.496
- Susan Fales-Hill
put together

29:50.497 --> 29:52.331
this really great
group of women.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.208

29:54.209 --> 29:55.834
"Tracey, I want you
to experience

29:55.835 --> 29:58.587
a reaIIy magicaI evening."

29:58.588 --> 30:01.799
- I invited Debra Lee,
the head of BET.

30:01.800 --> 30:07.304
I invited Marva Smalls,
who's at MTV, Vacom.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.514
- Star Jones was there.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.515
There was just a myriad

30:09.516 --> 30:12.893

black women in the room--

30:12.894 --> 30:15.729
in the box, actually,
and we were all there

30:15.730 --> 30:19.024
sharing in the triumph
of Misty dancing.

30:19.025 --> 30:22.110
- The makeup of the crowd
was completely different

30:22.111 --> 30:25.781
than you wouId see on any other
given day at the Met,

30:25.782 --> 30:29.576
and the power of one person
to change the--

30:29.577 --> 30:34.456
the crowd who comes
to see dance,

30:34.457 --> 30:36.708
I think that was really special.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.502
- For a black woman
to be the face

30:38.503 --> 30:40.337
of American Ballet Theatre's
spring season

30:40.338 --> 30:42.005
at the Metropolitan Opera House,

30:42.006 --> 30:44.424
we knew that
something was happening.

30:44.425 --> 30:47.886
- My manager, Gilda,
was waiting for me outside,

30:47.887 --> 30:50.389
and I walked out,
and l Iooked up,

30:50.390 --> 30:53.267
and I saw that the whole
front of the Met

30:53.268 --> 30:55.310
was covered in this woman

30:55.311 --> 30:57.813
with her breasts out
and arched back,

30:57.814 --> 31:00.023
and I was like,
"Oh, my gosh.

31:00.024 --> 31:03.443
That's a curvy bIack woman
on the front of the Met,

31:03.444 --> 31:04.528
and it's me."

31:04.529 --> 31:05.946
[laughs]

31:05.947 --> 31:09.658
And l just--we both cried,
because it meant so much

31:09.659 --> 31:12.035
for the African-American
community

31:12.036 --> 31:14.538
to feeI weIcome in that space.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.123
- When she entered the stage,

31:16.124 --> 31:18.709
and it just seemed
Iike coIIectiveIy,

31:18.710 --> 31:21.795
we all kind of leaned forward,

31:21.796 --> 31:26.091
and it was just the sense

31:26.092 --> 31:29.845
of pride and joy

31:29.846 --> 31:34.474
to just see
this talented, strong,

31:34.475 --> 31:39.313
gracefuI, amazing woman
grace the stage.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.565
- She came out to give
her bows at the end.

31:41.566 --> 31:42.691
It was quite amazing.

31:42.692 --> 31:46.153
There were people in the crowd
who were actually crying.

31:46.154 --> 31:49.156
There was an emotional
connection to her

31:49.157 --> 31:51.658
and to the fact that this was
an historic performance.

31:51.659 --> 31:53.660
- To sit in that theater
that night,

31:53.661 --> 31:59.499
surrounded by African-American
women of accomplishment,

31:59.500 --> 32:05.172
watching a ballerina
take center stage

32:05.173 --> 32:07.883
in one of the most
important works

32:07.884 --> 32:10.886
just felt like her life
had come full circle.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.429
- Afterwards,
they had a sort of

32:12.430 --> 32:14.014
a meet and greet
set up on the stage.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.015
They had tables set up.

32:15.016 --> 32:17.059
I said to Misty, "Wow,
you know, l was knocked out.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.060
"This is amazing.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.061
CongratuIations."

32:19.062 --> 32:20.437
You know, she had
a beautiful outfit on,

32:20.438 --> 32:23.482
she had some high heels on,
and she looked perfectly fine,

32:23.483 --> 32:27.194
and she said to me,
"I'm in a lot of pain, Nelson."

32:27.195 --> 32:28.862
And I was like,
"Whoa, you would never

32:28.863 --> 32:30.489
have known that
by watching her,"

32:30.490 --> 32:33.325
but it turned out
that she'd been dancing

32:33.326 --> 32:38.038
with severe fractures
in her shin.

32:54.764 --> 32:57.182
- That night,
I came into the theater,

32:57.183 --> 32:58.850
and I was in so much pain,

32:58.851 --> 33:01.812
I didn't know how
I was gonna get onstage.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.397
I knew it was there,

33:03.398 --> 33:05.148
but l kind of pushed it
to the side,

33:05.149 --> 33:09.861
because I knew how vital
that season was for me.

33:09.862 --> 33:13.240
The opportunity to do
principaI roIes as a soIoist

33:13.241 --> 33:15.492
l didn't think was something
that wouId come again.

33:17.036 --> 33:20.706
Knowing how much
of the black community

33:20.707 --> 33:23.959
was coming to the Met,
maybe for the first time,

33:23.960 --> 33:26.795
to support me,
l understood

33:26.796 --> 33:28.255
that I had to make it work.

33:28.256 --> 33:32.217
l knew that that night
stood for something

33:32.218 --> 33:34.136
so much bigger than me

33:34.137 --> 33:37.556
and beyond
what l can even imagine,

33:37.557 --> 33:39.558
so l knew
that no matter what I did

33:39.559 --> 33:42.185
on the stage that night,

33:42.186 --> 33:45.147
it was going to be
a historical evening.

33:46.649 --> 33:48.650
I think a dancer's
pain tolerance

33:48.651 --> 33:51.445
is on another level
that I--

33:51.446 --> 33:54.781
l have no idea
if it can be compared

33:54.782 --> 33:56.783
to anyone or anything.

33:56.784 --> 33:59.828
When you're onstage
and you're standing on one leg

33:59.829 --> 34:03.665
for, you know,
five, ten minutes at a time

34:03.666 --> 34:05.584
and you're supposed
to look like a beautiful swan

34:05.585 --> 34:06.960
and you have sweat
dripping in your eye

34:06.961 --> 34:09.212
and your butt's cramping
and your feet are cramping

34:09.213 --> 34:10.338
and then all of a sudden,

34:10.339 --> 34:14.426
you have to get up
and start jumping and moving,

34:14.427 --> 34:17.054
that pain is something
that every dancer deals with,

34:17.054 --> 34:18.929
and no one really
talks about it.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.478
- Pointe shoes
are uncomfortable.

34:24.478 --> 34:25.937
They hurt.

34:25.938 --> 34:28.565
Your feet, when you first
learn how to dance en point,

34:28.565 --> 34:31.400
are going to bleed,
sometimes through your shoes.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.652
That's unusual.

34:32.652 --> 34:33.652
[laughs]

34:33.654 --> 34:34.821
Why do we do that?

34:34.822 --> 34:38.074
- As soon as dance
becomes more athletic,

34:38.076 --> 34:42.871
which it has definitely become
in the 21st century,

34:42.871 --> 34:47.918
the body is just beaten up
way too much.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.587
Even a great dancer
like Mikhail Baryshnikov,

34:50.588 --> 34:52.380
I mean, he blew
his knees out from--

34:52.380 --> 34:55.634
like, if you jump high,
you land hard.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.928
- Here she is
dealing with still pain,

34:57.929 --> 34:59.137
trying to figure out,

34:59.138 --> 35:00.430
"How am I going
to deal with this?

35:00.431 --> 35:04.309
"But, oh, yeah,
I'm 29 years old,

35:04.310 --> 35:06.144
and I'm dealing
with the end of my career."

35:08.815 --> 35:14.611
She ended up going to a doctor
who works with top athletes

35:14.612 --> 35:16.738
at the New York HospitaI
for Special Surgery.

35:16.739 --> 35:20.117
He was the onIy person
who was confident that this--

35:20.118 --> 35:21.618
that you wiII dance again.

35:21.619 --> 35:25.038
Everyone eIse was teIIing her,
"Your career is over."

35:36.759 --> 35:39.761
[indistinct chatter]

35:41.472 --> 35:45.016
- So your diagnosis
is a mid-tibia stress fracture,

35:45.017 --> 35:47.561
which occurs very commonIy
in jumping athIetes.

35:47.562 --> 35:49.646
So the tibia bone--
which is, on her,

35:49.647 --> 35:52.941
the mid-shaft leg bone--
it takes all the stress.

35:52.942 --> 35:57.279
Instead of breaking in half,
it gets a tiny little break

35:57.280 --> 35:58.530
in the cortex surface,

35:58.531 --> 36:00.949
or the outer surface,
of the bone.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.117
They're very slow healing,

36:02.118 --> 36:05.370
so she spent months trying
to get this to heal beforehand,

36:05.371 --> 36:07.998
and then we made a decision
about how to treat it.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.709
We--our one decision
was take a--put a rod.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.711
One option was to take--
go near her knee

36:12.712 --> 36:14.588
and put a rod from here
all the way down\

36:14.589 --> 36:17.591
the bone in her leg
inside the bone.\

36:17.592 --> 36:18.717
The nice thing about that\

36:18.718 --> 36:20.427
is that it takes care
of the whole thing.\

36:20.428 --> 36:21.428
The disadvantage is,

36:21.429 --> 36:23.805
about 20% of people
have some knee pain,

36:23.806 --> 36:25.724
and she's a jumper,
so you try not

36:25.725 --> 36:27.934
to mess with her knee at all.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.936
We made an incision
right here in the front,

36:29.937 --> 36:31.521
and in that incision,

36:31.522 --> 36:33.565
we found the little
stress fractures,

36:33.566 --> 36:34.858
we drilled across them
with a needle

36:34.859 --> 36:36.359
to stimulate some bleeding,

36:36.360 --> 36:37.986
we packed the bone marrow
cells in there,

36:37.987 --> 36:39.154
and then we put the plate.

36:39.155 --> 36:44.868
- When I heard the words
"black dreaded line fracture,"

36:44.869 --> 36:47.495
that sounds like death to me.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.748
Like, hearing that word,
it was like,

36:49.749 --> 36:52.167
"What does that mean?"

36:52.168 --> 36:53.543
It was scary.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.712
And then finding out
that it meant

36:55.713 --> 36:58.465
almost a complete break
through my bone--

36:58.466 --> 37:03.845
it's hard to fathom that
that can happen from dancing,

37:03.846 --> 37:07.224
but it was just impact
over and over and over again,

37:07.225 --> 37:08.558
probably through
the course of a year,

37:08.559 --> 37:09.601

42:22.540 --> 42:24.290
before I decided
to have the surgery.

42:24.291 --> 42:25.708
And then Marjorie
was there with me,

after my surgery

helping me, you know--

42:31.090 --> 42:33.049
I was not walking still,

42:33.050 --> 42:34.717

on the floor,

How are you doing?

44:12.232 --> 44:13.399

of mine.

"Why don't you do
a performance with us first,

44:39.843 --> 44:42.387
and maybe you'll feel
more comfortable and secure?"

'The Dying Swan'?"

you couldn't tell.

and the feet.

- He really did.

and a good doctor is an artist.

52:52.002 --> 52:54.420

with the scar

52:56.339 --> 52:57.798

'cause you can wear...

- No one wants her...

- You know, I know
you don't really want to,

53:06.141 --> 53:09.476

about what was going on inside.

53:09.477 --> 53:11.729
- So am I.
- Yeah, but it's...

53:11.730 --> 53:13.689
- So we'll see.
- Yeah, look at you, though.

53:13.690 --> 53:16.108
- Still a bit sensitive, though.
- You're flexing here.

53:16.109 --> 53:18.694

53:18.695 --> 53:22.323
the very first time
that I found out who you were,

53:22.324 --> 53:26.285
which to me is
really crazy that it was

53:26.286 --> 53:30.915
far into my career
as a professional already,

53:30.916 --> 53:32.875
and I saw the film
"The Ballet Russe."

53:32.876 --> 53:34.501

- There wasn't that much said...

53:34.502 --> 53:35.502
- Right.

53:35.503 --> 53:37.630
- Because when l came aIong,

53:37.631 --> 53:39.798
the less said was the better,
you know?

53:39.799 --> 53:40.799
- Yeah, yeah.

53:40.800 --> 53:44.470
- l mean, l just went
as I was and who I was,

53:44.471 --> 53:47.806
but peopIe,
they thought it wasn't nice

53:47.807 --> 53:50.559
to taIk about race
or l might be insuIted.

53:50.560 --> 53:52.394
- I mean, I--
yeah, I think--

53:52.395 --> 53:56.649
- So a lot of it wasn't like--
now we have this time span,

53:56.650 --> 53:58.067
and now people
are very interested,

53:58.068 --> 53:59.818
and people
don't talk about it

53:59.819 --> 54:01.695
and especially
younger people, you know.

54:01.696 --> 54:03.364
- I mean, I think
it's important

54:03.365 --> 54:07.326
to be able to discuss it,
because then it forces peopIe

54:07.327 --> 54:11.538
to kind of confront
the issues.

54:11.539 --> 54:13.207
But yes, the first time
I saw you

54:13.208 --> 54:17.086
was in "The Ballet Russe" film,
and I cried my eyes out

54:17.087 --> 54:18.462
because I didn't even know

54:18.463 --> 54:22.132
that a black ballerina
of your level existed,

54:22.133 --> 54:23.759
and so that was kind of
the start

54:23.760 --> 54:26.011
of this mission I had,
you know,

54:26.012 --> 54:28.847
to learn more
about black ballerinas,

54:28.848 --> 54:33.143
to try and educate other people
about who you are,

54:33.144 --> 54:37.606
who Janet Collins is,
and so that's kind of

- Yes.

54:54.749 --> 54:58.085
- We did the same--
we did the same part,

54:58.086 --> 55:00.379
so it's hard for us to both...

55:00.380 --> 55:02.339
- Well, I think I've done it
in other positions.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.091

you just--

55:04.092 --> 55:07.094

to go into it...

and you're used to doing

the quick head switching.
