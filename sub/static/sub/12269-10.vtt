WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:03.134
(Emily) MY FATHER
 WAS AN INNOCENT MAN,

00:03.134 --> 00:04.775
DESTROYED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

00:04.775 --> 00:06.777
THE GRAYSONS ARE BEHIND THIS,
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:06.777 --> 00:10.041
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
 TO AVENGING HIS DEATH...

00:10.041 --> 00:11.512
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S
GONNA FIND YOU OUT.

00:11.512 --> 00:15.216
AND I WON'T STOP UNTIL
 THEY'VE ALL PAID THE PRICE.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.387
YOU MUST GO NOW.

00:16.387 --> 00:18.589
CONRAD IS A RUTHLESS MAN.
YOU ARE NOT SAFE.

00:18.589 --> 00:20.491
I SHOULDN'T HAVE CHOSEN VICTORIA
OVER YOU.

00:21.592 --> 00:23.454
LYDIA DAVIS FOUND A PHOTO
OF A GRAYSON PARTY.

00:23.454 --> 00:25.096
I WAS IN THE BACKGROUND.

00:25.096 --> 00:26.557
(Nolan) PRE-EMILY THORNE/
AMANDA CLARKE.

00:26.557 --> 00:29.029
EMILY ANNOUNCED THAT
SHE'S WITH CHILD.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.232
I'M THRILLED.
 SHE'S LYING.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.334
EMILY'S HAVING MY BABY.
(whispers) I'M SORRY.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.605
GOOD-BYE, DANNY.

00:34.605 --> 00:36.537
(Emily) I'LL SLIP IT
BACK INTO VICTORIA'S CLOSET

00:36.537 --> 00:38.209
BEFORE SHE EVER KNOWS
ABOUT IT.

00:38.209 --> 00:40.071
ONCE IT'S COVERED
IN GUNSHOT RESIDUE.

00:41.072 --> 00:45.116
YOUR WEDDING IS TOMORROW.
I WON'T BE IN ATTENDANCE.

01:01.792 --> 01:03.164
I'M SORRY.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.135
(gasps)

01:32.163 --> 01:34.865
WHILE I ADMIRE
YOUR DETERMINATION, EMS,

01:34.865 --> 01:37.468
SHOULDN'T GETTING VICTORIA
TO YOUR WEDDING TODAY

01:37.468 --> 01:39.730
BE YOUR SOLE FOCUS RIGHT NOW?

01:39.730 --> 01:42.333
I'VE COME TOO FAR
TO LET HER WIN.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.675
I'LL BE DAMNED IF SHE ROBS ME
OF MY WEDDING DAY.

01:44.675 --> 01:46.437
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
MORE DIRECT WAYS

01:46.437 --> 01:47.638
OF DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM.

01:47.638 --> 01:49.540
SHE'S NOT GETTING OFF
THAT EASY.

01:49.540 --> 01:50.741
WELL, I HATE TO SAY IT,

01:50.741 --> 01:53.214
BUT HER COLD FEET HAVE PUT YOURS
TO THE FIRE.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.615
WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS?

01:54.615 --> 01:55.746
I HAVE A PLAN.

01:55.746 --> 01:57.117
AND WHAT'S THAT?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.689
PROVING THAT BLOOD...
(exhales)

01:58.689 --> 02:00.751
IS THE MOST POWERFUL THING
OF ALL.

02:11.202 --> 02:14.265
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
GETTING READY?

02:14.265 --> 02:16.367
TO DO WHAT EXACTLY, MY DEAR?

02:16.367 --> 02:20.311
FINALLY GO DOWN
FOR THE DAVID CLARKE FRAME-UP?

02:20.311 --> 02:23.143
YEAH, THIS LIST WORKED ITS WAY
FREE FROM YOUR BAG

02:23.143 --> 02:26.217
WHILE YOU WERE BUSY
FAKING AFFECTION FOR ME.

02:26.217 --> 02:27.748
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.251
I THINK I'VE BEEN PLAYED A FOOL
BY YOU AND YOUR WILES.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.753
(closes book)
 IT'S OBVIOUSLY
MY GREATEST WEAKNESS.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.386
YOU'RE THE BENEFICIARY
OF MS. LeMARCHAL'S PATRONAGE,

02:35.386 --> 02:36.587
ARE YOU NOT?

02:38.929 --> 02:41.692
I WAS.

02:41.692 --> 02:43.194
BUT I-I...

02:43.194 --> 02:45.165
I TOLD I WOULDN'T
WORK WITH HER ANYMORE.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.667
OH.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.669
WELL, NONETHELESS, THIS HOUSE
HAS HIT ITS QUOTIENT

02:48.669 --> 02:50.271
FOR VINDICTIVE HARPIES.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.543
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO RESUME SLINGING DRINKS

02:52.543 --> 02:54.945
AT WHATEVER BACKWATER BERG
WILL HAVE YOU.

02:54.945 --> 02:56.547
PLEASE, CONRAD.

02:56.547 --> 02:59.179
I ADMIT THAT WHEN I RETURNED,
I WANTED PAYBACK,

02:59.179 --> 03:01.252
BUT I JUST COULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

03:01.252 --> 03:02.953
GET OUT.

03:02.953 --> 03:04.315
(cell phone alert chimes)

03:11.892 --> 03:14.265
(beep)

03:23.904 --> 03:26.937
I GATHER FROM THE TENOR
OF YOUR TEXT

03:26.937 --> 03:29.940
THAT ALL IS NOT WELL
THIS MORNING?

03:33.944 --> 03:36.747
VICTORIA ISN'T ATTENDING
THE WEDDING.

03:36.747 --> 03:37.948
(exhales) AH.

03:37.948 --> 03:40.291
(chuckles) WHY IS IT
THE WOMEN IN MY LIFE

03:40.291 --> 03:42.793
NEVER CEASE TO SURPRISE
AND DISAPPOINT?

03:42.793 --> 03:44.395
I KNOW THAT SHE AND I HAVE
HAD OUR DIFFERENCES,

03:44.395 --> 03:46.497
BUT TO MISS
HER SON'S WEDDING?

03:46.497 --> 03:50.701
WELL, YOU AND YOUR UNION HAVE
MY FULL SUPPORT, EMILY.

03:50.701 --> 03:52.533
(whispers) GOOD...

03:54.004 --> 03:56.507
BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE
NO FAMILY.

03:56.507 --> 04:00.741
AND I'M SURE THEIR ABSENCE
IS AMPLIFIED

04:00.741 --> 04:02.713
ON A DAY SUCH AS THIS.

04:02.713 --> 04:04.575
SO PLEASE DON'T THINK ME
PRESUMPTUOUS

04:04.575 --> 04:07.247
WHEN I HOPE THAT YOU MIGHT
FIND ME AS...

04:07.247 --> 04:09.280
ADEQUATE RECOMPENSE.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.283
I DO, CONRAD.

04:12.283 --> 04:15.986
AND I KNOW MY FATHER WOULD
SHARE MY FEELINGS FOR YOU

04:15.986 --> 04:17.658
IF HE WAS STILL ALIVE.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.690
AND PERHAPS HE WOULD'VE
HAD SOME... (inhales deeply)

04:19.690 --> 04:22.633
FRESH INSIGHT ON HOW TO DEAL
WITH VICTORIA.

04:22.633 --> 04:26.767
BUT SADLY, YOU ARE STUCK WITH
A MAN WHO HAS VERY LITTLE SWAY

04:26.767 --> 04:29.740
OVER HIS WIFE.

04:29.740 --> 04:32.743
THEN I GUESS THIS WILL BE...

04:32.743 --> 04:35.406
THE FIRST OF MANY THINGS
THAT VICTORIA MISSES.

04:35.406 --> 04:38.379
THE BIRTH, THE CHRISTENING...

04:38.379 --> 04:40.381
HER GRANDCHILD'S WHOLE LIFE.

04:42.353 --> 04:43.984
IF ONLY PATRICK HADN'T LEFT.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.286
WHY?

04:46.286 --> 04:49.490
BECAUSE HE REMINDED HER OF
THE PAIN HER ABSENCE CAN CAUSE.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.062
MAYBE HIS PRESENCE WOULD'VE
CHANGED HER MIND.

04:52.062 --> 04:54.294
I GUESS HE'S GONE.

04:55.996 --> 05:00.371
SO VICTORIA'S ATTENDANCE MEANS
THAT MUCH TO YOU?

05:02.333 --> 05:05.406
I JUST WANT THIS DAY TO
BE PERFECT,

05:05.406 --> 05:08.839
FROM START TO FINISH.

05:08.839 --> 05:10.581

05:10.581 --> 05:12.513

05:18.619 --> 05:20.050
TUX TAKES 10 MINUTES
TO GET ON,

05:20.050 --> 05:21.922
12 DEPENDING ON
THE CUFFLINKS.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.094
SINCE OUR FUTURE'S
RIDING ON THIS ISSUE,

05:24.094 --> 05:25.756
I FIGURED I'D POP BY.

I WAS--

05:41.642 --> 05:43.343
GIVING AN INTERVIEW
FOR THE ARTICLE ON YOUR CAKE.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.015
I KNOW. HOW'D IT GO?

05:45.015 --> 05:46.577
GOOD.

05:46.577 --> 05:48.949
SAID NICE THINGS ABOUT YOU.
I THINK I EVEN MEANT THEM.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.350
(chuckles)

05:50.350 --> 05:52.022
IT'D BE MUCH EASIER
IF YOU HATED ME RIGHT NOW.

05:52.022 --> 05:53.724
(laughs) AND I WOULD

05:53.724 --> 05:55.986
IF I HADN'T JUST BOOKED
TWO MORE GIGS.

05:55.986 --> 05:58.088
GUESS YOUR MASTER PLAN
WORKED, HUH?

05:58.088 --> 06:00.661
MM-HMM.

06:00.661 --> 06:01.992
LISTEN,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW--

06:01.992 --> 06:03.363
ENOUGH, DANNY.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.835
I KNOW YOU'RE USED
TO GETTING YOUR WAY,

06:04.835 --> 06:07.367
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE EVERYTHING
OKAY FOR EVERYONE.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.740
LIFE DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT,
EVEN FOR YOU.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.073
CONGRATS AGAIN.

06:27.718 --> 06:29.560
OF COURSE, CARRIE.

06:29.560 --> 06:30.721
WE HAVE A 3:00 TEE TIME,

06:30.721 --> 06:32.993
WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR COCKTAILS
AT SUNSET.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.525
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

06:34.525 --> 06:35.926
(beep)

06:35.926 --> 06:37.097
MOM?

06:43.604 --> 06:46.637
OH! PATRICK! (laughs)

06:46.637 --> 06:48.839
OH, MY GOD!

06:48.839 --> 06:50.010
ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:50.010 --> 06:51.181
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.
 ARE YOU?

06:51.181 --> 06:53.043
WHILE YOU WERE SLY

06:53.043 --> 06:54.845
TO EXILE HIM
TO THE NEAREST ISLAND,

06:54.845 --> 06:58.088
DID YOU NOT THINK I'D COME TO
KNOW HE WAS IN MANHATTAN?

06:58.088 --> 07:01.091
YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY SON.

07:01.091 --> 07:03.954
I WAS HOPING TO USE DEAR PATRICK
AS INCENTIVE

07:03.954 --> 07:06.957
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT
ATTENDING DANIEL'S WEDDING.

07:06.957 --> 07:09.760
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHY YOU WOULD CARE.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.962
OH, WAIT. LET ME GUESS--
EMILY PUT YOU UP TO IT.

07:11.962 --> 07:13.864
WELL, SHE AND I BOTH AGREED

07:13.864 --> 07:16.937
THAT YOUR ABSENCE SHOULDN'T
BECOME TODAY'S FOCUS.

07:16.937 --> 07:20.440
SO I'M GOING TO QUASH
MY UNDERSTANDABLE RESISTANCE

07:20.440 --> 07:22.112
TO EMBRACE ONE SON OF YOURS

07:22.112 --> 07:25.476
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO MUSTER
THE LOVE TO SUPPORT THE OTHER.

07:25.476 --> 07:27.017
IF YOU THINK I'M GOING
TO BE BLACKMAILED

07:27.017 --> 07:29.820
BY A COLLUSION WITH THAT--
 THEY'RE RIGHT, MOM.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.023
YOU WORKED SO HARD TO REPAIR
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

07:33.023 --> 07:35.455
I WANTED TO DO THE SAME
FOR DANIEL.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.658
AND THAT'S WHY I CAME
WHEN CONRAD REACHED OUT.

07:37.658 --> 07:41.632
WHEN CONRAD REACHES OUT,
BEWARE OF WHAT'S IN HIS HAND.

07:41.632 --> 07:43.594
I APPROACH WITH OPEN PALM,
VICTORIA,

07:43.594 --> 07:46.997
HOPING TO LEAVE OUR GRIEVANCES
IN THE PAST.

07:46.997 --> 07:49.139
IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN
TO PATRICK,

07:49.139 --> 07:51.702
UNDERSTAND THIS, CONRAD--

07:51.702 --> 07:55.145
THEY WILL BE WIPING WHAT'S LEFT
OF YOU UP WITH A SPONGE.

07:55.145 --> 07:57.848
I'LL HAVE A TUXEDO SENT...

07:57.848 --> 08:00.210
ASSUMING WE HAVE A DEAL
THAT YOU WILL ATTEND

08:00.210 --> 08:03.053
ALL WEDDING-RELATED
FESTIVITIES.

08:03.053 --> 08:05.556
SAY "YES," MOM.

08:05.556 --> 08:07.588
FOR THE FAMILY.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.059
YOUR FAMILY.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.864
OKAY, LET'S GO OVER THIS
ONE LAST TIME.

08:13.864 --> 08:15.125
BEFORE YOU BOARD
THE GRAYSON YACHT,

08:15.125 --> 08:16.597
I'M GONNA SNEAK ON SIDE

08:16.597 --> 08:18.999
AND PRESET THE GUN WE BOUGHT
IN VICTORIA'S NAME.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.232
THEN I WILL HIDE OUT AND WAIT
UNTIL EXACTLY 10 PAST 9:00,

08:22.232 --> 08:23.804
WHEN YOU SHOULD
BE APPROACHING THE BUOY.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.105
AT WHICH POINT,

08:25.105 --> 08:27.077
YOU WILL PREMIERE
 THE GRAYSON FAMILY SLIDE SHOW,

08:27.077 --> 08:29.540
WHICH
 I NAUSEATINGLY PREPARED.

08:29.540 --> 08:30.711
(Emily)
 WHEN EVERYONE'S WATCHING,

08:30.711 --> 08:33.984
I'LL MAKE SURE
 VICTORIA LEAVES.

08:33.984 --> 08:36.015
(Aiden) THEN I'LL MAKE SURE
 SHE'S TRAPPED,

08:36.015 --> 08:38.118
THEN AWAIT
 THE SOUND OF GUNSHOTS.

08:39.119 --> 08:42.192
(Emily) AND I'LL ONLY FIRE ONCE
 I'VE POURED MY BLOOD ON DECK

08:42.192 --> 08:43.924
AS EVIDENCE THAT SHE SHOT ME.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.099
(Aiden) ONCE YOU'VE JUMPED
 OVERBOARD,

08:49.099 --> 08:52.132
I'LL RELEASE VICTORIA'S DOOR,
 ENSURING HER LACK OF ALIBI.

08:52.132 --> 08:56.006
NOW YOU HAVE
 EXACTLY 20 MINUTES

08:56.006 --> 08:58.639
UNTIL THE COAST GUARD
 STARTS THE SEARCH.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.010
RETRIEVE THE CASE
FROM THE BUOY,

09:00.010 --> 09:02.212
USE THE MINI SCUBA TANK TO GET
BENEATH THE SURFACE,

09:02.212 --> 09:06.016
CATCH THE CURRENT,
AND MEET ME AT THE BEACH.

09:09.119 --> 09:11.151
(clicking)
 (Emily) THEN FINALLY,
 WITH MEANS, MOTIVE,

09:11.151 --> 09:13.884
GUNSHOT RESIDUE ON
 HER BRACELET, AND NO ALIBI,

09:13.884 --> 09:17.157
VICTORIA GRAYSON WILL BE
 UNDER ARREST FOR MY MURDER.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.989
AND UNDER QUESTIONING,
I GUARANTEE

09:18.989 --> 09:23.093
THAT SHE'LL ROLL ON CONRAD
IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAVE HERSELF.

09:23.093 --> 09:26.967
LET'S TAKE DOWN THE GRAYSONS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

09:41.211 --> 09:42.312
(sea bird calls)

09:42.312 --> 09:44.655
HEY.

09:47.718 --> 09:49.690
(sighs)

09:49.690 --> 09:52.122
YOU CAME TO SAY GOOD-BYE?

09:52.122 --> 09:56.697
SINCE YOU'RE NOT COMING TO
THE WEDDING... YEAH, JACK, I AM.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.175
LOOK, I'M, UH...
(inhales deeply)

10:05.175 --> 10:06.677
I'M SURE YOU GOT
A MILLION THINGS TO DO,

10:06.677 --> 10:09.910
AND I'M NOT MUCH
FOR GOOD-BYES, SO...

10:11.381 --> 10:13.814
(breathes deeply)

10:35.305 --> 10:38.709
JACK...

10:38.709 --> 10:40.170
(sighs) THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I WANTED TO TELL YOU

10:40.170 --> 10:41.812
BEFORE I GO.

10:41.812 --> 10:43.974
ABOUT AMANDA.

10:45.916 --> 10:49.019
(whispers) I WAS WITH HER
WHEN SHE DIED.

10:49.019 --> 10:50.280
WHAT?

10:50.280 --> 10:51.682
I WAS ABLE TO GET YOU OFF
THE BOAT.

10:51.682 --> 10:54.024
BUT BY THE TIME
I MADE IT BACK...

10:56.787 --> 10:58.729
(whispers)
I COULDN'T SAVE HER.

10:58.729 --> 11:02.162
(voice breaks)
I HELD HER IN MY ARMS, JACK.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.694
AND THE LAST THING
THAT SHE MADE ME PROMISE

11:03.694 --> 11:07.367
WAS THAT I WOULD TAKE CARE
OF YOU AND CARL.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.740
AND YOU'RE JUST NOW SAYING THIS?

11:09.740 --> 11:11.702
WHY WAIT TILL NOW?

11:11.702 --> 11:13.243
I KNOW IT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE

11:13.243 --> 11:15.746
JUST TOO BUSY PROTECTING
YOUR PLAN.

11:15.746 --> 11:17.247
WHICH I CHANGED
BECAUSE YOU ASKED ME TO,

11:17.247 --> 11:20.680
BECAUSE THERE WAS A TIME, JACK,
WHEN YOU WERE MY BEST FRIEND.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.283
BUT LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE BECOME
AND WHO YOU'RE TURNING ME INTO.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.015
YOU ARE SO SELFISH.

33:10.159 --> 33:14.623

I BROUGHT UP WHAT YOU DID

EVERY DAY.

33:40.449 --> 33:43.752

UNDERSTAND THAT.

35:47.316 --> 35:49.448
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

35:54.423 --> 35:55.924
DANIEL?

35:59.388 --> 36:01.159
(beep)

36:01.159 --> 36:02.461
THAT WAS SARA'S ROOMMATE.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.233
DANIEL, WHAT IS IT?

36:04.233 --> 36:07.236
SARA TRIED TO KILL HERSELF.

36:07.236 --> 36:08.397
I AM SO SORRY.

36:08.397 --> 36:10.599
DON'T. DON'T.

36:10.599 --> 36:11.770
(whispers) DON'T.

36:19.708 --> 36:21.250
VICTORIA, WAIT.

36:21.250 --> 36:23.682
HAVE YOU COME TO HELP?

36:23.682 --> 36:25.414
(scoffs)

36:25.414 --> 36:28.557
MM. WELL, I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
TO ASK IF YOU HAD CLUB SODA

36:28.557 --> 36:31.560
FOR THIS SPILL,
SINCE MOST BARTENDERS DO.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.662
I'M DONE MAKING MAI TAIS.

36:33.662 --> 36:36.194
(Lydia) CONRAD'S PROMISED ME
A PENTHOUSE.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.527
(Victoria) IF YOU'RE REFERRING
TO THAT SAD LITTLE PIED-à-TERRE

36:38.527 --> 36:40.829
WHERE HE ENTERTAINS
HIS MISTRESSES,

36:40.829 --> 36:42.831
I'D WASH THE SHEETS FIRST.

36:42.831 --> 36:44.603
YOU DON'T LOVE HIM, VICTORIA,

36:44.603 --> 36:47.276
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING ON ABOUT.

36:47.276 --> 36:50.909
BESIDES, WE BOTH KNOW YOU HAVE
FAR BIGGER CONCERNS THAN ME.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.281
(photo rustles)

37:03.622 --> 37:07.496
AND THEY SAY NO ONE EVER THINKS
ABOUT THE MOTHER OF THE GROOM.

37:16.465 --> 37:18.467
(footsteps approach)

37:20.669 --> 37:23.972
I THOUGHT I'D BRING YOU
A REAL DRINK,

37:23.972 --> 37:26.715
SINCE I SUSPECT YOU'RE
ABOUT AS PREGNANT AS I AM.

37:28.877 --> 37:30.449
THIS PHOTO PROVES THAT

37:30.449 --> 37:34.022
YOU'VE BEEN TARGETING MY FAMILY
AND MY SON FOR YEARS.

37:34.022 --> 37:35.324
NOW WHO ARE YOU?

37:35.324 --> 37:37.756
AS OF FIVE HOURS AGO,

37:37.756 --> 37:38.927
I'M EMILY GRAYSON.

37:38.927 --> 37:40.829
YOU'RE TRYING TO BAIT ME.

37:40.829 --> 37:44.633
YOU'D LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN
FOR ME TO GRAB YOU BY THE THROAT

37:44.633 --> 37:47.366
SO THAT YOU CAN SAY
THAT I'M CRAZY.

37:47.366 --> 37:49.668
YOU KNOW, FOR ONCE,

37:49.668 --> 37:52.371
YOU'RE NOT COMPLETELY MAD,
VICTORIA.

37:52.371 --> 37:55.344
DANIEL NEEDED A LITTLE
LAST-MINUTE INCENTIVE,

37:55.344 --> 37:59.047
SO I STOLE FROM
THE MASTER MANIPULATOR.

37:59.047 --> 38:01.610
AFTER ALL, ISN'T A FAKE
PREGNANCY HOW YOU LANDED CONRAD?

38:01.610 --> 38:05.484
WELL, THE DIFFERENCE IS
THAT I BELIEVED I LOVED HIM.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.816
BUT YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A PREDATOR.

38:07.816 --> 38:11.320
AN EMPTY SHELL
WHO SEEKS TO WREAK HAVOC.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.491
THAT'S IT.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.693
DO YOU EVEN HEAR YOURSELF,
VICTORIA?

38:14.693 --> 38:16.525
WHAT A SAD, SAD WOMAN.

38:16.525 --> 38:17.966
TO CARE ABOUT
WHAT YOU THINK, EMILY,

38:17.966 --> 38:20.298
I WOULD HAVE TO
FEEL SOMETHING FOR YOU.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.831
YOU ARE AS WORTHLESS TO ME

38:22.831 --> 38:25.303
AS THIS BRACELET.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.005
GO ON.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.937
GO AFTER IT,

38:28.937 --> 38:32.010
BEFORE THE OTHER BOTTOM-FEEDERS
BEAT YOU TO IT.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.782
GOOD-BYE, VICTORIA.

38:33.782 --> 38:35.714
(muffled scream)

38:36.715 --> 38:38.917
(lowered voice)
TWO MINUTES AND THEN FIRE.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.699
(slurring heavily)
I HEARD EVERYTHING.

38:53.632 --> 38:56.735
DANIEL.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.570
WHAT, YOU GONNA SHOOT ME?

39:01.570 --> 39:02.771
(whispers) NO.

39:02.771 --> 39:04.012
(voice breaks) YOU SET ME UP.

39:04.012 --> 39:05.674
TWO YEARS!

39:05.674 --> 39:07.075
TWO YEARS,

39:07.075 --> 39:08.677
AND I BET YOU LAUGHED AT ME
EVERY TIME I QUESTIONED YOU.

39:08.677 --> 39:10.419
AND YOU JUST FED ME
MORE OF YOUR LIES.

39:10.419 --> 39:11.620
AND WHY?!

39:11.620 --> 39:14.383
WHY DID YOU TELL ME
I WAS GONNA BE A FATHER?!

39:14.383 --> 39:15.754
I'M SORRY.

39:38.747 --> 39:43.381
(fireworks whistling
 and exploding)

39:43.381 --> 39:46.384
(John Philip Sousa's
 "National Emblem March")

39:52.821 --> 39:56.725
(whistling and exploding
 continues)

39:56.725 --> 39:58.527
(man) CAPTAIN, MAN OVERBOARD!

39:58.527 --> 40:00.729
(man) ALL HANDS ON DECK!

40:00.729 --> 40:01.830
(man) BRING HER ABOUT!

40:01.830 --> 40:03.401
(alarm blaring)
 (man) OFF THE STARBOARD!

40:03.401 --> 40:04.973
(man) ALL RIGHT!
 (man) STARBOARD ENGINE
FULL THROTTLE!

40:04.973 --> 40:09.438
(alarm continues blaring)
 (crew shouting indistinctly)

40:09.438 --> 40:12.981
(man speaks indistinctly)
 (radio chatter)

40:12.981 --> 40:16.685
(crew continues
speaking indistinctly)

40:16.685 --> 40:17.986
(Conrad)
WHAT THE DEVIL HAPPENED?

40:17.986 --> 40:19.588
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.

40:19.588 --> 40:23.552
(crew continues
speaking indistinctly)

40:23.552 --> 40:26.154
(Charlotte) WHERE'S EMILY?

40:28.657 --> 40:30.659
WHERE'S VICTORIA?

40:34.563 --> 40:36.034
(both laugh)

40:36.034 --> 40:38.837
I'M, UH...

40:38.837 --> 40:40.609
I'M GONNA SHOWER.

40:40.609 --> 40:42.611
WHY DON'T YOU

40:42.611 --> 40:45.844
PUT ON SOME MUSIC
AND, UH, COME JOIN ME?

40:45.844 --> 40:48.647
OKAY.

40:52.150 --> 40:53.782
I MEAN, DUDE.

40:53.782 --> 40:56.825
YOU EVER HEAR OF
A UNIVERSAL REMOTE?

40:56.825 --> 40:59.157
(click)

41:20.909 --> 41:22.751
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

41:22.751 --> 41:25.554
DON'T WORRY.

41:25.554 --> 41:26.685
(sighs)

41:26.685 --> 41:28.617
I JUST WANNA END THINGS RIGHT
WITH HER.

41:31.590 --> 41:34.793
EMILY LEFT THIS FOR ME,
BUT I THINK SHE SHOULD HAVE IT.

41:34.793 --> 41:36.525
IT WAS AMANDA'S.

41:36.525 --> 41:37.696
SHE'S NOT HERE?

41:37.696 --> 41:39.227
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

41:39.227 --> 41:41.169
SHE SHOULD HAVE BEAT ME
TO THE BEACH TEN MINUTES AGO.

41:41.169 --> 41:43.902
THE DISTRESS BEACON HAS NOT
BEEN ACTIVATED.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.936
THEN WHERE THE HELL IS SHE?

41:59.017 --> 42:00.719
OH, GOD.

42:15.834 --> 42:17.535
(Jack) EMILY?

42:18.707 --> 42:21.009
EMILY!

42:21.009 --> 42:22.571
EMILY!

42:22.571 --> 42:24.673
EMILY!

42:24.673 --> 42:26.114
EMILY!
