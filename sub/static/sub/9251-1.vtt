Four Phoenix area residents
are missing tonight

05:35.335 --> 05:37.905
after a local camping trip
in the Estrella Mountains.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.273
[male reporter]
Despite the efforts of
the Arizona County rescue,

05:40.307 --> 05:41.942
and the AHP,

05:41.975 --> 05:44.812
officials continue to
scour the are by ground

05:44.845 --> 05:45.879
and in the air,

05:45.913 --> 05:48.449
but have found no sign
of the missing hikers.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.784
The men were all
experiences riders,

05:50.818 --> 05:51.952
and were in good health.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.121
Susan Lauder hasn't
heard from her son, Glenn,

05:54.154 --> 05:56.457
since Thursday morning
around 11 a.m.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.059
[narrator]
March 14th, 1997,

05:59.092 --> 06:01.429
authorities recover
an abandoned A.T.V.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.231
belonging to 28-year-old
Glenn Lauder.

06:04.264 --> 06:05.533
His food and water supplies

06:05.566 --> 06:08.101
are found
less than 50 feet away,

06:08.135 --> 06:10.370
but Glenn is nowhere
in the area.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.372
[male reporter]
...that provided
the first real clues

06:12.406 --> 06:14.708
as to what may have happened
to the four missing riders

06:14.742 --> 06:16.777
on March 14th.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.178
The individual
committing these abductions

06:18.211 --> 06:19.847
was extremely methodical.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.214
The location
of the disappearances

06:21.248 --> 06:23.617
led us to believe this was
the work of a lone perpetrator

06:23.651 --> 06:25.385
operating in a specific part
of the desert.

of four missing
Arizona hikers...

06:32.092 --> 06:34.662
[Narrator]
Sheriff's officials
arrest Walton S. Gayson,

06:34.695 --> 06:36.897
a retired veteran
and religious fanatic,

06:36.930 --> 06:39.567
with a long history of
confrontations with police.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.268
[male reporter]
The Phoenix
District Attorney's office

06:41.301 --> 06:43.036
says Gayson was involved

06:43.070 --> 06:45.405
in a fourth
aggravated assault

06:45.439 --> 06:48.876
where he attacked a Maricopa
County sheriff's station.

...testimony from
Walton S. Gayson,

07:00.621 --> 07:01.922
now the prime suspect,

07:01.955 --> 07:04.357
in what investigators
believe may be a...

07:04.391 --> 07:05.726
...four-person homicide.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.795
[narrator]
During interrogation,

07:07.828 --> 07:10.297
Gayson confesses he
witnessed the men's abduction,

07:10.330 --> 07:12.265
but insisted
the men were taken

07:12.299 --> 07:14.301
by non-terrestrial beings.

But before Gayson
can stand trial,

07:39.059 --> 07:41.328
Gayson is taken
into federal custody

07:41.361 --> 07:43.230
and all information
in the case

07:43.263 --> 07:44.932
is confiscated.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.034
...the FBI will be
reviewing the evidence.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.969
We'll be making a statement
in the coming weeks.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.303
Thank you.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.805
[Lt. Jordan]
Gayson absolutely
committed these murders.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.306
There's no question
in my mind.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.810
It was like
we were being sabotaged
by our own country.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.914
[interviewer]
You think this was
a conspiracy?

08:00.948 --> 08:02.382
Absolutely.

08:02.415 --> 08:04.284
Something happened
out there in the desert.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.253
[interviewer]
What do you think happened?

08:06.286 --> 08:07.921
We got too close
to something much bigger

08:07.955 --> 08:09.657
and the military
didn't want us to know.

by giving this interview

09:03.410 --> 09:05.412
they can come after you
and your family?

Yeah, I know.
I know.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.586

09:13.787 --> 09:15.589
Yeah, let's go.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.825
[interviewer]
In 1997, you took part

09:17.858 --> 09:19.860
in one of the largest
military cover-ups

09:19.893 --> 09:21.929
in United States history.

09:22.763 --> 09:23.997
That's correct.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.199
[interviewer]
And this involved
the direct engagement

09:26.233 --> 09:28.568
with extra-terrestrial craft.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.003
That's correct.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.539
[interviewer]
But the official
Defense Department reports

09:32.572 --> 09:34.608
have never been disclosed.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.245
Congress doesn't even know
that this happened.

09:39.780 --> 09:43.150
[narrator]
This began March 13th,
1997...

09:43.183 --> 09:44.918
...during the
single-most controversial

09:44.952 --> 09:47.688
U.F.O. sighting
in North America...

09:55.095 --> 09:57.430
Tonight, lights in the sky...

09:57.464 --> 09:58.932
[male reporter]
...are talking about
one of the nation's

09:58.966 --> 10:00.533
largest U.F.O. sighting.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.636
There was a case...

10:02.670 --> 10:04.471
...oh, a couple of years ago
in Arizona

10:04.504 --> 10:06.273
of some lights
that were seen

10:06.306 --> 10:07.574
over Arizona.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.811
Um, and that has never
been fully explained.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.080
...like a fleet of planes
or helicopters

10:13.113 --> 10:14.514
flying in formation.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.117
[male reporter]
The first reports
of the strange flying object

10:17.150 --> 10:18.786
came in about 8:20 p.m.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.789
from a former police officer
in Paulden, Arizona...

10:21.822 --> 10:23.957
[2nd male reporter]
Hundreds of eyewitnesses

They've been here before.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.796

10:28.829 --> 10:30.297
those were recon missions...

10:30.330 --> 10:33.633

10:33.667 --> 10:36.069
...but Phoenix was different.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.604
[interviewer]
How was it different?

10:40.708 --> 10:42.442
[man]
This was the first time...

10:43.777 --> 10:45.378
...we knew what they
were capable of.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.514
The first time we'd been
provoked into an attack,

10:47.547 --> 10:49.282
or maybe the first time
they were.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.419
[interviewer]
And as a result
of this operation

10:52.452 --> 10:55.322
four civilian men
became collateral damage.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.893
Yeah.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.732
I don't think a night's gone by
in 17 years

11:04.765 --> 11:07.167
I haven't thought about
what happened to those boys
that night.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.839
[men shouting indistinctly]

11:14.808 --> 11:16.476
[Glenn]
All right, here's what I got.

11:16.509 --> 11:20.180
See here, I had to cannibalize
a bunch of other cameras.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.716
They are wrecked,
unfortunately.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.284
But...

11:24.317 --> 11:26.019
Yep, that's right.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.387
Hands-free, baby.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.289
And why hands-free,
you ask.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.390
Let me show you.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.525
For this. Hyah!

11:32.559 --> 11:33.593
Right?

11:33.626 --> 11:35.763
Shit like this. Pow!

11:36.864 --> 11:39.800
Captain Fucking Magic, right?
[glass shatters]

11:39.833 --> 11:42.002
Uh, Glenn had mounted...

11:42.035 --> 11:44.171
...this camera
to the front of his bike.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.173
It actually went
to his helmet, too.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.975
The best we could do
at the time, you know.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.743
But it, like--
He recorded everything.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.344
He managed to get
every stunt

11:51.378 --> 11:53.847
way before GoPros,
or, you know,

11:53.881 --> 11:55.148
any of the shit we have now.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.918
Glenn was, um... like,
never scared of shit.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.319
He was just fearless.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.022
[indistinct shouting]

12:02.055 --> 12:03.190
And you do realize

12:03.223 --> 12:04.691
how ridiculous you look
in all this, right?

[Glenn]
You look ridiculous--
Fuck you!

He saved up his own money
to buy his cameras.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.802
He'd film stunts, tricks...

12:15.602 --> 12:17.237
Anything you could film.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.473
He was pointing that thing
as something.

it was...

It was like life
just stopped.

No, I know.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.184
It'll be fine.
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.485
Where are we even fucking going?

13:38.518 --> 13:40.253
[Glenn]
Look. Here, just...

13:40.287 --> 13:41.688
We're right here.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.090
[Jacob]
Why do we even have to
go that far?

13:43.123 --> 13:45.625
Why can't we just, like,
hit a bar, or...

13:45.658 --> 13:48.929
[Glenn]
I'm not taking you to the Nam,
or anything.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.998
I just don't wanna get bit
by a fucking rattlesnake.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.732
[Glenn]
Look, I'm doing this
as much for you

13:52.765 --> 13:54.834
as I am for him.
[knocking on the door]

13:54.868 --> 13:56.836
[dog barking]

13:56.870 --> 13:58.271
[knocking continues]

13:58.305 --> 14:00.640
[Glenn]
Yeah, I hear you!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.942
Hey!

14:01.975 --> 14:04.577
[indistinct shouting]

14:04.611 --> 14:06.213
[Mitch]
Jake, you're looking good,
buddy.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.347
Where's Ryan?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.316
[Glenn] What?
He's still asleep.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.185
Shh, shh, shh.
[giggling]

14:12.219 --> 14:13.420
[inaudible]

14:21.628 --> 14:24.697
[shouting]
[laughter]

14:24.731 --> 14:27.901
[indistinct shouting]

14:30.603 --> 14:32.139
[Glenn]
Yeah, I know.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.041
No, I fucked it up
on that last jump.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.976
- Why?
- It's not gonna zoom anymore.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.110
[Mitch] Oh, shit.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.379
[Glenn]
It'll be fine, though.
I just can't zoom.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.547
[Mitch]
It'll be great.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.085
[Glenn]
Oh, man, if we don't
get out of here this day

14:45.118 --> 14:46.987
it's because of you.
You.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.555
What's the problem?

14:48.588 --> 14:50.290
The zipper's stuck.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.858
[Glenn]
No, it's not. Hold on.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.630
[indistinct conversation]

14:57.664 --> 14:59.232
[Glenn]
Smells like victory.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.234
[muffled]
Leather!

15:01.868 --> 15:03.170
It's so good.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.471
[Melissa] So good.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.539
[overlapping indistinct shouts]

15:06.573 --> 15:07.607
[Glenn]
Out, out, out!

15:07.640 --> 15:08.808
[Mitch]
No, no, no, no!

15:08.841 --> 15:10.978
One, two, three!

15:11.011 --> 15:12.145
[Glenn]
After you.
I'm locking up.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.213
[Mitch]
Oh, thank you, darling.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.449
[man]
I mean, for years...

15:16.483 --> 15:17.884
...they told us it was over.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.852
They couldn't explain
the reports,

15:19.886 --> 15:22.322
the bone fragments,
the lack of evidence...

15:23.890 --> 15:25.625
No one would help us.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.195
I mean, if-
if our boys are dead,

15:28.228 --> 15:29.629
where are the bodies?

15:30.430 --> 15:31.398
[indistinct conversation]

15:31.431 --> 15:32.632
[Melissa]
You guys look great.

15:32.665 --> 15:33.900
[shouting]

15:33.933 --> 15:36.603
[Ken Adams]
No parent should have to
outlive their kid.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.772
We just wanna know...
what happened to our boys.

15:39.806 --> 15:42.342
*

15:44.411 --> 15:45.645
What?

15:46.879 --> 15:48.915
By coming forward
with this information now

15:48.948 --> 15:50.917
you risk exposing
a military operation

15:50.950 --> 15:53.253
that lead to the disappearance
of these four men.

15:56.356 --> 15:59.726
[interviewer]
How did you become involved
with this event?

15:59.759 --> 16:02.295
In 1997 I was stationed
at Luke Air Force Base

16:02.329 --> 16:03.430
in Phoenix, Arizona,

16:03.463 --> 16:05.465
as part of
a Special Operations
aerial unit.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.933
[interviewer]
In the weeks leading up
to the incident

16:06.966 --> 16:08.901
had you experienced
any warning signs

16:08.935 --> 16:10.770
about an impending attack?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.639
There were...

16:12.672 --> 16:14.941
...reports of
livestock mutilations

16:14.974 --> 16:16.076
and things of that nature.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.378
On our side of the spectrum,
we had experienced,

16:18.411 --> 16:22.082
uh, atmospheric anomalies
about 50 clicks
west of the ranch.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.351
[interviewer]
This is in the area where
the four men were abducted?

16:24.384 --> 16:25.785
[man]
That's right.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.320
[interviewer]
But there was
no other indication

16:27.354 --> 16:28.455
of an attack
or an invasion?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.157
No.
No, not at that time.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.991
[interviewer]
And, leading up
to the incident,

16:32.025 --> 16:34.061
were you or your superiors
aware of the four civilian men

16:34.094 --> 16:35.195
prior to that night?

16:35.228 --> 16:36.963
[man]
No, we were not.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.331
[interviewer]
Walton Gayson?

16:38.365 --> 16:39.366
No.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.135
[interviewer]
Were you aware that the men
had been recording themselves?

16:42.169 --> 16:44.271
Did you-did you know
that the footage existed?

16:44.304 --> 16:48.441
Not at that time.
I have subsequently
become aware of that.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.842
W.W.F. brother!

16:49.876 --> 16:51.811
Motherfucker!

16:51.844 --> 16:53.012
- Balls!
- What is that?

16:53.046 --> 16:54.147
Sweaty balls!

16:54.181 --> 16:55.582
What-- No, no!
What's that?!

16:55.615 --> 16:57.317
- What?
- No, no, under your shirt!

16:57.350 --> 16:59.052
Ryan! [indistinct]
Ryan, Ryan, Ryan!

16:59.086 --> 17:00.853
No, no, no, no!
Come here, come here,
come here!

17:00.887 --> 17:01.954
[laughter]

17:01.988 --> 17:03.223
Come on, get off!
Get off!

17:03.256 --> 17:05.958
Get off!
- Oh, my God!

17:05.992 --> 17:08.560
[laughter]
Oh, my God, dude!

17:08.595 --> 17:10.230
- What the hell is that?
- All right, all right.

17:10.262 --> 17:11.998
Jesus.
You fuckin' happy?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.032
[laughter]
Shit.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.035
[laughter]
What happened?

17:16.069 --> 17:17.337
Krissy wanted it.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.405
- So?!
- What?

17:18.438 --> 17:20.607
Did you guys
get matching tattoos?!

17:20.640 --> 17:22.474
[Mitch stammering]
When did you get that?

17:22.509 --> 17:23.542
Couple of months ago.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.778
- After you got divorced?
- After?!

17:25.811 --> 17:28.348
She was-she was scared.
I didn't want her to go alone.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.584
So you fucking went with her?!
Are you nuts?!

17:31.618 --> 17:33.353
You're so [indistinct], Jake!

17:33.386 --> 17:35.655
I didn't want her to be scared.
Just fuckin' leave it.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.624
Leave it.
- Aw, you're so sweet!

17:37.657 --> 17:40.293
[overlapping fawning]

17:40.327 --> 17:42.028
He gets a hug.
He gets a hug!

17:42.061 --> 17:44.497
Oh, my God.
It's so good.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.599
It's the best thing
I've ever seen!

17:46.633 --> 17:48.668
Sit in my lap,
Captain Sweaty Balls.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.103
[laughter]

17:50.137 --> 17:51.338
[man]
At that time, Hale-Bopp

17:51.371 --> 17:53.706
was making its approach
to the northwest.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.710
0430, NorComm, El Paso
reported...

17:59.412 --> 18:01.114
...a triangular shape...

18:02.349 --> 18:05.385
...that was trailing behind
the comet's tail.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.722
[interviewer]
Did you know
what the object was?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.191
They referred to it
as a chevron,

18:11.224 --> 18:13.293
but no, nobody knew
what the hell it was.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.230
At 0700, there was traffic
about a separation.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.233
The object had been
following the comet until...

18:20.267 --> 18:22.101
...1.32 aeronautical units,

18:22.135 --> 18:23.703
at which time, it began...

18:24.971 --> 18:28.074
...a break-off and a rapid
descent into our atmosphere.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.743
And was there any indication
where it was heading?

18:32.479 --> 18:34.881
Yeah, somewhere over Arizona.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.249
This is how it begins!

18:36.283 --> 18:38.718
We'll have to stop
for gas first.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.454
[helicopters thundering]
Whoa!

18:41.488 --> 18:42.822
Hello...

18:42.855 --> 18:44.123
We should take those.
Yeah?

18:44.157 --> 18:45.625
- Yeah.
- Beautiful, right?

18:45.658 --> 18:48.295
Here, take-take-take it.
I gotta show you something.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.863
Come on, man, I thought
you were ready to go.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.399
Ready? Ready?

18:52.432 --> 18:54.201
[grunts]

18:54.234 --> 18:57.437
[shouting, laughing]

18:57.470 --> 19:00.773
It's just like the best thing
I've ever seen.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.309
No, it's not!

19:02.342 --> 19:04.010
Mitch was a good kid.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.481
He didn't deserve
any of this.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.917
Well, the family took
the disappearance really hard,

19:10.950 --> 19:12.585
especially since...

19:12.619 --> 19:14.854
...Mitch's brother Mark,
he, uh...

19:14.887 --> 19:18.225
...died in
a helicopter crash,'92...

19:18.258 --> 19:20.193
...a few years
after the Gulf War.

19:20.227 --> 19:22.362
You know, that's why
I think Mitch and Glenn

19:22.395 --> 19:24.297
had that special bond.

19:24.331 --> 19:27.467
I think, you know, growing up
around military, they...

19:27.500 --> 19:29.402
...they were like family,
you know, they...

19:29.436 --> 19:31.003
...they were close.
They were really tight-knit,

19:31.037 --> 19:33.340
and once Mark passed on,

19:33.373 --> 19:35.174
definitely more so,
I think, like,

19:35.208 --> 19:36.776
Glenn became like a brother
to Mitch.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.712
*

19:41.614 --> 19:43.483
[car passing]

19:45.151 --> 19:47.587
[game chirping]

19:50.156 --> 19:51.491
Don't big brother him
right now.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.859
Be nice.
Just gotta be nice.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.527
[Glenn]
Look, I'm being-
I'm being nice,

19:54.561 --> 19:56.629
'cause I'm telling him
that he's brilliant.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.699
So, why aren't you painting?
You never paint.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.133
I do paint.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.602
How come you don't make music?

20:02.635 --> 20:03.636
[indistinct]

20:03.670 --> 20:05.538
If you're-
If you're all a musician?

20:05.572 --> 20:08.675
[overlapping chatter]

20:08.708 --> 20:10.310
This is not about me,
this is about him.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.811
Why don't you make music?

20:11.844 --> 20:13.313
- I do make music.
- You know what?

20:13.346 --> 20:15.648
He doesn't have to make music,
'cause he dresses
like he makes music,

20:15.682 --> 20:17.317
and that's the important part.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.985
You know, the difference is...

20:19.018 --> 20:22.722
...is I'm gonna be
a librarian that faints...

20:22.755 --> 20:26.158
...your gonna fucking go to L.A.
and you're gonna...

20:26.192 --> 20:28.395
...you know, we're gonna
listen to you on the radio.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.298
You know,
you're my best friend,

20:31.331 --> 20:32.832
but you need to get
the fuck away from me

20:32.865 --> 20:34.601
and get the hell out of here.

20:34.634 --> 20:35.768
You know?

20:35.802 --> 20:37.337
You said I was
your best friend.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.172
Only on Sunday nights.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.742
[indistinct conversation]

20:42.775 --> 20:45.312
All right, run.
Keep running...
all the way to the coast.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.546
Commercial break is...

20:46.579 --> 20:47.914
If you don't-
if you don't come back,

20:47.947 --> 20:51.117
we know you've gone
to Los Angeles
to be a rock and roll star.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.555
[bell jingles]

20:56.088 --> 20:57.490
Dude.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.258
Turn the fucking camera off,
man.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.027
You just fuckin'
ran out of there.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.129
Turn the fucking camera off,
please.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.298
What's your fuckin' problem?

21:05.332 --> 21:07.133
Fuck that guy, dude.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.035
I love him, I know--

21:09.068 --> 21:10.470
He's doing it
because he loves you, man.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.039
No, he's not.
The only reason why he...

21:13.072 --> 21:14.240
Because we want you to--

21:14.273 --> 21:16.242
I get it.
I get it.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.346
But I don't need to hear
from Jake, who can't
get over his wife,

21:19.379 --> 21:21.448
who won't take his fucking
wedding ring off,

21:21.481 --> 21:22.882
that I need to change my life,

21:22.915 --> 21:24.050
and that I need to do something
with him.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.885
Why doesn't he get off his ass
and do anything?

21:25.918 --> 21:26.986
That's his problem.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.589
It is his problem,
but I don't need to be...

21:29.622 --> 21:31.424
I know what I'm doing
with my life,

21:31.458 --> 21:34.394
and at least... at least
out of the four of us...
[bell jingles]

21:34.427 --> 21:37.029
I've got-I've got a plan
to do something.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.899
I'm not just sitting
on my ass, and-and...

21:39.932 --> 21:41.934
I don't know, dude.
You can't just...

21:41.968 --> 21:44.437
I'm willing to do-- I'll pack
everything that I have

21:44.471 --> 21:46.573
in the back of my car
and fucking drive,

21:46.606 --> 21:47.940
and I'll get there.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.743
And I'll pump gas,
I'll paint houses.

21:50.777 --> 21:53.713
I don't give a shit
what I have to do.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.047
Well, just...

21:55.081 --> 21:56.716
There is a side of me
that just doesn't wanna leave.

21:56.749 --> 21:57.917
I mean, I dunno.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.520
I mean, I'm certainly not
one to talk.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.622
I know. I'm good.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.861
[interviewer]
You don't believe Gayson
acted alone?

22:08.895 --> 22:10.497
When you're doing
a criminal investigation,

22:10.530 --> 22:11.764
you look at
every possibility,

22:11.798 --> 22:13.600
and then you consider
the impossible.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.635
the impossible was
that four healthy young men

22:15.668 --> 22:17.470
could've been overpowered,
abducted and murdered

22:17.504 --> 22:18.638
by a single individual.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.207
[eerie ambience]

22:34.854 --> 22:36.122
[interviewer]
We have a very limited time

22:36.155 --> 22:38.324
that we get to talk
to each other, so, uh...

22:38.357 --> 22:41.494
...I would kinda like to get
to some questions that I have.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.430
I've been wanting to ask you
for quite a while...

22:45.364 --> 22:49.469
So, if you don't mind,
are you ready to, uh...

22:49.502 --> 22:50.937
Ready to begin?

22:52.739 --> 22:55.542
You don't wanna
shake hands first?

22:55.575 --> 22:56.743
[interviewer]
I don't think we're allowed

22:56.776 --> 22:58.377
to actually touch each other,
Mr. Gayson,

22:58.411 --> 23:00.413
but I appreciate the offer.

23:00.447 --> 23:01.648
Courtesy.

23:01.681 --> 23:02.782
[interviewer]
Why did your department

23:02.815 --> 23:04.383
release Gayson
after the incident?

23:04.417 --> 23:05.852
We're following protocol.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.186
We investigate the case,

23:07.219 --> 23:09.722
we investigate the leads...

23:09.756 --> 23:10.623
...we hit a dead end.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.260
[interviewer]
Yeah, but you had a suspect
in custody.

23:17.129 --> 23:20.567
We had a suspect who...

23:20.600 --> 23:22.201
...said that he witnessed
the men in the area,

23:22.234 --> 23:24.336
but there wasn't enough
evidence to hold him.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.371
[interviewer]
So you're saying
your department

23:25.404 --> 23:27.907
released the last person
to see the men alive.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.109
No one took him seriously.

23:31.778 --> 23:34.514
He was a bit of a...
a bit of a...

23:34.547 --> 23:35.848
...a bit unstable.

23:36.783 --> 23:40.119
History paints a picture
of me... you...

23:40.152 --> 23:43.289
Say I was the monster
that took them...

23:45.825 --> 23:48.928
The simple truth is
I wasn't the real monster.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.565
I didn't fuckin' feel it
at first.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.100
- Really?
- Because of the shock.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.702
Yeah, and then I looked down,

23:55.735 --> 23:58.437
the branch is literally
sticking through my thigh.

23:58.471 --> 24:01.040
You always laugh
when you get hurt.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.408
Whoa.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.944
[jet engines roaring]

24:06.913 --> 24:08.881
...your Frankenstein
helmet rig thing?

24:08.915 --> 24:09.916
Yeah, yeah, get it-
get it the back.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.818
Get it the back.
Record button's on the side.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.352
Mash it and start recording.

24:14.053 --> 24:17.857
[indistinct conversation]

24:17.890 --> 24:20.860
You'll be the first man on
Earth to film his own death.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.161
Well done.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.963
- Pretty cool little thing.
- Yeah.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.397
- You like that?
- What's up?

24:25.431 --> 24:26.699
Hey, how's it going?

24:26.733 --> 24:28.768
Hey guys, something's going on
over there.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.002
Whoa, what's up?

24:30.036 --> 24:32.004
Check it out.
- What's going on?

24:32.038 --> 24:33.472
[helicopter thumping overhead]
What is it?

24:33.506 --> 24:34.841
What's up?

24:37.977 --> 24:40.513
[man]
By 0900, multiple
atmospheric distortions

24:40.547 --> 24:42.481
began appearing
across the state.

24:42.515 --> 24:45.017
[interviewer]
In the same position as
the previous sightings.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.418
That's right.

24:46.452 --> 24:50.523
Uh, the Nevada border,
Paulden and Flagstaff.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.124
[interviewer]
Those were the same
warning indicators

24:52.158 --> 24:54.527
that happened in Russia
and Syria.

24:54.561 --> 24:57.930
We had two birds in the air,
but there were no other...

24:57.964 --> 25:00.132
...confirmed contacts,

25:00.166 --> 25:02.702
except for the formation.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.904
[helicopters thumping loudly]

25:08.140 --> 25:10.677
[jets roaring]

25:10.710 --> 25:13.279
- Whoa.
- Oh, shit.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.715
- What is that?
- That's not normal.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.283
[crash]

25:17.316 --> 25:18.450
- Damn it!
- Fuck!

25:18.484 --> 25:20.352
What the fuck?!

25:20.386 --> 25:22.321
- God damn it.
- Get out and check it, Jake.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.857
- What did you hit?
- I didn't do anything!

25:24.891 --> 25:26.058
God damn it!

25:26.092 --> 25:27.226
- You gonna look at this?
- Yeah, I'm on it.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.861
You ever put oil
in this thing?

25:28.895 --> 25:30.262
- Fuck you.
- Yeah.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.131
How far is it
to your folks' place, man?
We could walk it.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.466
No, no, it's like,
at least 15 miles or more.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.535
I mean, I don't even know
where we are out here.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.839
I don't think Triple A
is gonna come out this far.

25:39.872 --> 25:43.075
Yeah, well, I don't think
anybody's coming out this far.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.944
I'm sorry, guys.
This is my fault.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.679
No, listen,
don't worry about it, look.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.615
We'll try and find a phone
and see if...

25:48.648 --> 25:50.316
...if anybody's there
we can call for help. Yeah?

25:50.349 --> 25:51.350
I'll stay here and see
if I cant

25:51.383 --> 25:52.585
at least get it running,
or something.

25:52.619 --> 25:55.688
I'll just--
You know, I'll get it
patched up if I can.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.890
Meet us back here.
All right?

25:57.924 --> 25:59.291
Jake, you're-- Yeah?

25:59.325 --> 26:00.359
Yeah, we're good.

26:01.327 --> 26:04.296
Dude, she's a big girl.
She'll be fine.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.732
Well, I don't like it.

26:05.765 --> 26:08.067
[helicopter blades thumping]

26:10.469 --> 26:13.105
Wooh! Yeah!

26:14.506 --> 26:16.342
...his nut sweat stain

26:16.375 --> 26:18.377
was, like, a third the size
of yours,

26:18.410 --> 26:19.879
which makes no sense at all.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.714
- It was cold!
- You remember that?

26:21.748 --> 26:24.483
He's like, "No, my nuts just
aren't as sweaty! That's why!

26:24.516 --> 26:26.218
It just looks smaller!"

26:26.252 --> 26:27.419
[laughter]
Shut up.

26:27.453 --> 26:29.055
He starts screamin',
"I was in the pool!

26:29.088 --> 26:30.356
I was in the pool!"

26:30.389 --> 26:31.824
[laughter]

26:31.858 --> 26:35.027
[interviewer]
Were the four men aware
of the impending operation?

26:35.061 --> 26:37.730
Do you think they had any idea
of what was about to happen?

26:40.132 --> 26:41.467
[stammering]
You've asked me

26:41.500 --> 26:44.103
some form of that question
two or three times now...

26:44.136 --> 26:46.706
...and I've already
given you the answer.

26:46.739 --> 26:49.108
They didn't know.
We didn't know.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.643
That's it.
That's not gonna change.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.244
[Glenn] Tire...

26:52.278 --> 26:53.946
...and tired.
[chuckles]

26:53.980 --> 26:56.048
[helicopters thumping]

27:03.823 --> 27:05.958
Okay...

27:11.664 --> 27:13.632
Hey, don't touch the fence.
I think it's electric.

27:13.666 --> 27:14.967
You think?

27:16.202 --> 27:17.536
You think this thing's on?

27:23.976 --> 27:25.277
I hope it's not on.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.613
I just picture a fat serial
killer on the other end.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.015
Shut up.

27:35.755 --> 27:38.090
[interviewer]
So what was the official
cause of death?

27:38.124 --> 27:40.626
[woman]
They said that Ryan...

27:40.659 --> 27:42.194
...had been attacked...

27:42.228 --> 27:44.663
by some kind of an animal.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.499
The coroner...

27:47.533 --> 27:51.670
...said that they thought
they found what...

27:51.704 --> 27:53.439
...were his remains.

27:53.472 --> 27:55.307
[female reporter]
Police say the remains
of the four men

27:55.341 --> 27:56.776
have yet to be identified,

27:56.809 --> 27:58.878
however, officials are
classifying this as...

27:58.911 --> 28:00.512
...an animal attack,

28:00.546 --> 28:02.548
believing the men
may have become victims...

28:02.581 --> 28:05.417
[male reporter]
...the March 14th,
1997 attacks,

28:05.451 --> 28:08.187
where four hikers disappeared
in the Estrella Sierra...

28:08.220 --> 28:09.655
[second male reporter]
...following the coroner's
announcement,

28:09.688 --> 28:10.957
the Country Attorney's office

28:10.990 --> 28:12.691
has suspended
further investigation

28:12.725 --> 28:14.360
into the men's disappearance.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.428
[interviewer]
How many bodies
did you recover?

28:16.462 --> 28:18.397
There were no bodies...

28:18.430 --> 28:20.432
...no tissue residue...

28:21.567 --> 28:24.470
...not even D.N.A. could be
recovered from the site.

28:24.503 --> 28:26.205
[interviewer]
So, in your opinion...

28:26.238 --> 28:28.507
...could this have been a bear?

28:28.540 --> 28:29.909
No.

28:30.409 --> 28:31.677
Absolutely not.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.712
Everyone knew Gayson
would never testify,

28:33.746 --> 28:35.281
so the medical examiner
was instructed

28:35.314 --> 28:37.817
to classify the event
as a bear attack.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.151
The families never
had any resolution

28:39.185 --> 28:40.652
to what happened
to their kids.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.154
[male reporter]
Despite public criticism

28:42.188 --> 28:43.823
of the medical examiner's
announcement,

28:43.856 --> 28:45.992
the County Attorney's office
as suspended

28:46.025 --> 28:48.360
further investigation into
the men's disappearance.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.330
[Melissa]
Giving up over here,
or what?

28:51.363 --> 28:53.866
I guarantee you he has never
put oil in this car.

28:53.900 --> 28:57.203
He can barely wipe his own ass,
how can he make it in L.A.?

28:57.236 --> 28:59.238
What's with you?
You guys used to be
best friends.

29:00.506 --> 29:01.740
I'll take that.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.209
I've had enough of this.

29:07.713 --> 29:09.615
[murmurs]

29:11.417 --> 29:13.719
I'm gonna go try to find
some help,

29:13.752 --> 29:16.722
like that road over there.
- Are you sure?

29:16.755 --> 29:18.490
Yeah, it's not that far.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.060
- All right.
- I'll be back.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.528
- Be careful, all right?
- I will.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.064
I don't want Mitch to put me
in the ground.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.868
[sighs]
Great. Great.

29:30.402 --> 29:33.539
[man]
By 1100 hours, NorComm had
lost visual with the object.

29:33.572 --> 29:34.606
Within 30 minutes,

29:34.640 --> 29:36.275
we had lost
two KA-12 satellites

29:36.308 --> 29:38.945
over the southwestern
hemisphere.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.546
[interviewer]
They were entering
our atmosphere.

29:41.981 --> 29:44.083
[man]
There were
conflicting reports...

29:45.885 --> 29:47.119
It was a fucking mess.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.320
Nobody knew what they
were looking for

29:48.354 --> 29:49.555
or where to look.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.925
[sighs]

29:55.094 --> 29:56.795
Well, Glenn,
congratulations,

29:56.829 --> 30:00.566
'cause we are pretty fucked
out here.

30:00.599 --> 30:03.903
Uh, Ryan's car is
out of commission, so...

30:03.936 --> 30:05.237
...we're stuck...

30:05.271 --> 30:07.006
...and...

30:07.039 --> 30:09.441
...there isn't shit for miles.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.611
And judging by the look
of that shack

30:12.644 --> 30:13.745
you guys just headed off for,

30:13.779 --> 30:15.381
I'm gonna guess you're about
to be chopped up

30:15.414 --> 30:17.483
into hamburger meat, so...

30:17.516 --> 30:20.419
...let me just go on the record
and say, "I told you so."

30:20.452 --> 30:22.855
You know,
this whole trip just...

30:23.689 --> 30:25.491
...great fuckin' idea.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.894
You need to leave!

30:27.927 --> 30:30.229
You need to leave now!

30:31.830 --> 30:34.700
[interviewer]
Were you with the men the
night they disappeared?

30:38.570 --> 30:40.239
I warned 'em...

30:44.110 --> 30:46.445
...but they came back.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.247
You need to leave!

30:49.115 --> 30:50.816
You shouldn't be here!

30:52.985 --> 30:54.954
[Grayson cries out]

30:54.987 --> 30:56.522
[Jacob] Fuck.

30:58.390 --> 30:59.825
[interviewer]
Authorities claim
you were responsible

30:59.858 --> 31:01.627
for the disappearance
of those men.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.795
That you had never spoken
about any military operation

31:03.829 --> 31:04.863
that night.

31:04.897 --> 31:07.299
[Jacob]
Get away from my car!

31:07.333 --> 31:09.035
[Gayson in interview]
If you say so.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.139
[interviewer]
Why not come forward...

31:13.172 --> 31:14.873
...and expose the truth?

31:15.841 --> 31:19.578
I've made peace with my Lord...

31:19.611 --> 31:22.248
...and He shall
grant me forgiveness.

31:23.815 --> 31:26.585
I can't say the same for you.

31:27.853 --> 31:30.722
[Jacob taking
shuddering breaths]

31:32.124 --> 31:33.525
Oh, Jesus!

31:33.559 --> 31:35.127
Open the fucking door!

31:35.161 --> 31:36.495
- Take it easy.
- Where did he go?

31:36.528 --> 31:37.696
- Jake--
- Where'd he go?!

31:37.729 --> 31:39.565
Fucking guy right here.
- What the fuck are you doing?!

31:39.598 --> 31:41.567
I'm serious. There was
some fucking psychopath

31:41.600 --> 31:42.969
banging on the fucking car!

31:43.002 --> 31:44.870
- Hey, relax, Ryan...
- I think I just peed a little.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.838
- I didn't see anybody.
Did you?
- What happened?

31:46.872 --> 31:48.174
Why don't you just
own up to the fact

31:48.207 --> 31:50.242
that you were beatin' off
in there?

31:50.276 --> 31:52.979
Look, can we get back
on the A.T.V.s?

31:53.012 --> 31:55.181
Sorry to disturb you.
All right?

31:55.214 --> 31:57.449
[interviewer]
I mean, if we can
expose a conspiracy,

31:57.483 --> 31:58.951
then none of this
needs to happen again.

31:58.985 --> 32:01.320
It is happening.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.422
I think people believe
what they want to believe,

32:03.455 --> 32:06.225
but in my heart
I know Gayson killed those men.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.128
They come, they take,
they feed.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.397
They have no pity...

32:11.430 --> 32:13.799
..no remorse.

32:13.832 --> 32:17.569
Their vision is pure.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.738
[A.T.V. motors rumbling]

32:21.840 --> 32:23.275
See ya later.

32:23.842 --> 32:25.244
[shouts]

32:25.277 --> 32:27.279
[Melissa]
Pick you up later tonight!

32:39.525 --> 32:40.892
[Mitch shouts]

32:40.926 --> 32:43.062
[indistinct shouting]

32:43.095 --> 32:44.530
[Ken Adams]
Those boys found something
out here,

32:44.563 --> 32:47.166
something no one
was supposed to see.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.672
They police, they just...
They didn't wanna say what.

32:56.108 --> 32:57.776
[interviewer]
What do you think
they found?

33:00.412 --> 33:02.248
[Ken Adams]
The truth.

33:02.281 --> 33:04.683
[interviewer]
And then you received a call
to stop the investigation?

33:08.087 --> 33:09.855
Can you shut that off?

33:11.123 --> 33:13.125
[indistinct radio chatter]

33:15.861 --> 33:19.665
Our department...
was told to back down

33:19.698 --> 33:22.568
by the Air Force
Investigative Commission.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.104
We have recovered
circumstantial evidence

33:25.137 --> 33:26.872
of possible connection
to an incident...

33:26.905 --> 33:28.274
[police officer]
We received a call...

33:28.307 --> 33:30.776
...and they told us
to suspend all search
and rescue operations

33:30.809 --> 33:33.412
in the Estrella region,
so that's what we did.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.013
[interviewer]
You were told, essentially,
to back off.

33:35.047 --> 33:35.947
Yes.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.884
[interviewer]
Well, would you say that
that was unusual

33:38.917 --> 33:40.419
for the military to intervene

33:40.452 --> 33:42.020
in a missing
persons investigation?

33:43.255 --> 33:45.724
Yeah.
I'd say that's very unusual.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.527
I was told,
"Don't ask any more questions."

33:48.560 --> 33:51.963
And that's kind of
where it ended.

33:51.997 --> 33:55.000
This... was not
about a bear...

33:55.033 --> 33:57.569
...or even about
investigating Gayson...

33:59.205 --> 34:02.007
[interviewer]
You believe they were
covering something up.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.009
It was a distraction...

34:04.042 --> 34:05.744
...to keep people
from knowing the truth.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.782
Look, no one talks about
what happened that night.

34:10.815 --> 34:13.784
[interviewer]
At this point
you were at DEFCON 2?

34:13.819 --> 34:16.722
At 1730, the 104th reported
multiple bogies

34:16.755 --> 34:18.889
descending into
Nevada airspace.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.426
[dispatcher]
911 . What is your emergency?

34:20.458 --> 34:22.561
[man]
They're in the sky!
They're all over!

34:22.594 --> 34:24.196
[dispatcher]
Excuse me, sir?
What is your emergency?

34:24.230 --> 34:25.897
[man]
Look out the window.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.199
It's a whole fucking fleet!

34:27.233 --> 34:28.500
[dispatcher]
Sir, I need you
to calm down

34:28.534 --> 34:29.701
and tell me
what's happening.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.103
[man]
It's a fucking invasion!

34:31.137 --> 34:34.505
[woman] Look at 'em all!
[man] I got that one on video.

34:34.540 --> 34:37.576
[man]
When they made an abrupt
turn to the south...

34:37.609 --> 34:39.511
...law enforcement
and civilians
had already seen it.

34:39.545 --> 34:42.114
There was no way to isolate
or contain it.

34:42.148 --> 34:43.681
We couldn't respond in time.

34:43.715 --> 34:44.983
[man]
...major sighting here.

34:45.016 --> 34:47.319
Well, our newsroom has been
flooded with calls tonight...

34:47.353 --> 34:48.719
[male reporter]
...reports from
all across the state

34:48.754 --> 34:50.922
of mysterious flying objects
in the sky...

34:50.956 --> 34:52.524
[2nd male reporter]
...in what many
are already calling

34:52.558 --> 34:55.261
the largest U.F.O. sighting
in North America.

34:55.293 --> 34:56.862
There were so many
phone calls coming in

34:56.895 --> 34:58.264
from the City
and the County,

34:58.297 --> 35:00.332
and people were concerned
that this object

35:00.366 --> 35:02.100
could've been a threat.

35:02.134 --> 35:03.502
It passed over our airport,

35:03.535 --> 35:06.538
it passed over the towers,
the buildings,

35:06.572 --> 35:08.874
and nobody was doing
anything about it.

35:08.907 --> 35:09.941
[chatter]

35:09.975 --> 35:11.843
I don't care what nobody's
talkin' about, man!

35:11.877 --> 35:13.512
Those were aliens
like E.T.

35:13.545 --> 35:14.780
Aliens, man!

35:14.813 --> 35:16.248
[female reporter]
...panicked 911 calls,

35:16.282 --> 35:18.049
reports to
local authorities,

35:18.083 --> 35:19.618
airport officials
were prompted

35:19.651 --> 35:22.020
to temporarily
suspend flights

35:22.053 --> 35:25.424
as the strange lights
crossed over
Sky Harbor airspace.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.559
Air traffic controllers
had been notified

35:27.593 --> 35:29.561
by Luke Air Force Base
authorities,

35:29.595 --> 35:32.298
and numerous reports
from nearby residents

35:32.331 --> 35:35.634
confirm the base
had scrambled F-15s

35:35.667 --> 35:37.269
shortly after the sightings.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.804
[man]
We were tracking them
for about 90 minutes,

35:38.837 --> 35:40.339
coming in from Nevada.

35:42.174 --> 35:43.775
As soon as they
entered our airspace

35:43.809 --> 35:46.111
we scrambled two 15s...

35:46.144 --> 35:48.414
...but...

35:48.447 --> 35:52.150
...the 104th was already engaged
over that area.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.452
[interviewer]
Engaged?

35:59.124 --> 36:01.693
Yeah, they had encountered them
over the Barry Goldwater Range,

36:01.727 --> 36:03.729
and evaded them to the south...

36:03.762 --> 36:05.063
...until we could intercept.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.867
That's when Operation Snowbird
went into effect.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.068
[Mitch]
Don't worry, baby.

36:10.101 --> 36:11.803
I'll snuggle up
and keep you warm.

36:12.904 --> 36:15.574
Quit jerkin' off
with your toys.
[kissing noises]

36:15.607 --> 36:17.008
Geek.

36:17.042 --> 36:18.810
I see 'em, dude.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.212
What the fuck, man?
I mean, look at 'em.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.248
They're all in a--
They look like
they're in a line.

36:22.281 --> 36:23.615
- What are you guys
looking at?
- You're fucking retarded.

36:23.649 --> 36:24.516
You know that, right?

36:25.784 --> 36:28.454
[Glenn]
Look, look, look, look.
They're coming this way.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.789
Jesus. That...

36:30.822 --> 36:32.324
That's a U.F.O.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.960
[Mitch] Not a U.F--
Those are flares, dude.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.528
[Glenn]
Flares from what?

36:36.562 --> 36:39.097
[Mitch]
Shh, shh, shh. Listen.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.333
Huh, you hear 'em?
You hear the A-10s?

36:41.367 --> 36:42.334
[Ryan]
Yeah, yeah, he can hear 'em.

36:42.368 --> 36:44.069
[Mitch makes
indistinct comment]

36:44.102 --> 36:46.905
- What are they doing out here?
- Must be part of that
operation we saw this morning.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.039
[Mitch]
Yeah, they've been
doing maneuvers

36:48.073 --> 36:50.409
over the desert all day.

36:50.442 --> 36:51.910
Oh, dude.
Check it, check it, check it.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.879
Look, look, look.
You see 'em?

36:53.912 --> 36:55.314
The two A-10s?

36:56.081 --> 36:58.850
That's not it...
Those are 15s!

36:58.884 --> 37:02.488
Oh, shit, those are 15s!
Look how fast they're goin'!
[jets roar]

37:02.521 --> 37:04.089
Wow!

37:04.122 --> 37:06.892
Why are they dropping' flares?
Are they chasin' something?

37:06.925 --> 37:09.495
Maybe it's an exercise or a
training-training something.

37:09.528 --> 37:10.729
At nine o'clock at night?

37:10.762 --> 37:12.931
Yeah, I mean, I haven't seen
15s do maneuvers over a city

37:12.964 --> 37:14.333
in what... like, forever.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.067
Why here? Why aren't they
down by the base?

37:16.101 --> 37:17.536
I dunno.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.738
You know what this means,
right?

37:19.771 --> 37:21.673
We're fucking going up there.
- No, no.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.509
- We are going up there.
- Absolutely not!

37:23.542 --> 37:25.411
Let's go!
We are doing this, baby!

37:25.444 --> 37:28.747
- Absolutely not, dude.
- What?! Come on!

37:28.780 --> 37:31.483
We don't know what that is.
We don't even know
where the hell we are right now!

37:31.517 --> 37:33.552
I mean, we should just
stay here or go home.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.186
Melissa's fucking
waiting on us anyway.

37:35.220 --> 37:36.422
No, he's got a point, listen.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.023
Whatever shit
is going on over there,

37:38.056 --> 37:39.891
we do not
need to be fucking with it.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.627
Are you kidding me?
You wanna go home, Jake?

37:41.660 --> 37:43.028
Would you quit hiding
from stuff?

37:43.061 --> 37:44.563
Please stop being
such a fucking pussy.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.432
I'm not being a fucking pussy.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.066
I just font think we should
be fucking around out here.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.167
[chatter]

37:49.200 --> 37:50.536
I just have a bad feeling
about this.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.037
I think we should
go home right now.

37:52.070 --> 37:53.238
- No!
- It's just some planes!

37:53.271 --> 37:55.173
Yeah, in like two minutes
they're gonna be gone.

37:55.206 --> 37:56.942
You're telling me
that those are flares

37:56.975 --> 37:58.544
dropped from fighter jets
and you wanna go closer?

37:58.577 --> 38:00.879
I mean, what if it's the
fuckin' Russians or something?

38:00.912 --> 38:03.982
It's not the Russians!
What are you talking about?!

38:04.015 --> 38:05.451
Look, look, look.
I swear...

38:05.484 --> 38:08.354
...I will get you
the best blow job ever,

38:08.387 --> 38:09.788
just please come with me.
All right?

38:09.821 --> 38:11.323
We'll go up there,
we'll come back down.

38:11.357 --> 38:13.158
It'll take ten minutes.
You're going.

38:13.191 --> 38:14.660
You are going.
Yes?

38:14.693 --> 38:16.762
- Fuckin A, man.
- Yes, he's going!

38:16.795 --> 38:19.798
He's going,
and you're going too, baby!

38:19.831 --> 38:21.400
Let's do it!
This is gonna be fucking great!

38:21.433 --> 38:23.435
Let's go!
Let's go, let's go!

38:23.469 --> 38:25.871
[engines revving]

38:25.904 --> 38:27.739
Lieutenant Colonel
James Edwards,

38:27.773 --> 38:29.675
now the Assistant Director
of Operations

38:29.708 --> 38:32.911
for the 175th
Operations Group in Maryland,

38:32.944 --> 38:35.381
says his squadron
of A-10 Warthogs

38:35.414 --> 38:38.884
was on a training exercise
over the Barry Goldwater Range.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.085
[interviewer]
So you're saying

38:40.118 --> 38:42.488
the lights that people
witnessed were flares?

38:42.521 --> 38:45.857
Most likely they were our
illumination parachute flares.

38:45.891 --> 38:47.092
[interviewer]
Is that unusual

38:47.125 --> 38:50.095
to drop flares
over a populated area?

38:50.128 --> 38:52.964
We were miles
from any civilian areas.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.233
It was standard procedure
to drop...

38:55.266 --> 38:57.302
...unused ordinance after a run.

38:58.637 --> 38:59.971
I still don't know what it was.

39:00.005 --> 39:03.108
As a pilot and a former
Air Force officer,

39:03.141 --> 39:05.243
I can definitively say
that this craft

39:05.276 --> 39:07.078
did not resemble
any man-made object

39:07.112 --> 39:08.747
that I had ever seen,

39:08.780 --> 39:10.115
and it was certainly not

39:10.148 --> 39:12.250
high-altitude flares

39:12.283 --> 39:14.786
as put out by the, uh,
the Air Force

39:14.820 --> 39:16.555
at Luke air Force Base

39:16.588 --> 39:20.426
'cause I've never seen
flares fly in formation.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.394
[man]
There are about
five or six craft.

39:22.428 --> 39:23.328
Uh...

39:24.663 --> 39:27.666
We were tracking their progress
for about ten more minutes.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.837
And when they passed
over the city

39:31.870 --> 39:34.005
they broke south
for Tucson.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.208
[interviewer]
What changed?

39:38.176 --> 39:40.378
Well, after what happened in,
uh...

39:40.412 --> 39:42.748
...Belgium and Osaka, we-we...

39:42.781 --> 39:45.150
...sure as hell weren't gonna
take any chances.

39:46.351 --> 39:48.019
[interviewer]
What kind of chances?

39:49.621 --> 39:51.022
[clears throat]

39:51.757 --> 39:53.158
Move! Let's go!

39:53.892 --> 39:55.360
Move it! Let's go!

39:55.393 --> 39:57.463
[jets roaring]

39:59.230 --> 40:00.666
Are you guys hearing this?

40:00.699 --> 40:03.702
[jet roars]
[indistinct shouting]

40:03.735 --> 40:05.370
- Oh, man!
- did you see that shit?!

40:05.403 --> 40:07.038
[Jacob]
We should just turn around.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.907
[jet roars]

40:08.940 --> 40:11.543
- Freaking me out.
- Have you ever seen
anything like this?

40:11.577 --> 40:12.711
What's going on?

40:12.744 --> 40:14.613
What's that one behind
that one over there?

40:14.646 --> 40:16.114
[Mitch]
I don't know.
It's not a 15.

40:16.147 --> 40:18.717
[Glenn]
You're fucking A right.
It's moving too fast.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.686
[Mitch] Look, they're
dropping their flares.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.387
[Jacob]
We should fucking
get out of here.

40:24.723 --> 40:28.527
[man]
Two of our F-15s approached
them from the North.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.563
One of our birds
attempted to make contact
with the lead craft...

40:31.597 --> 40:33.064
...and the other objects

40:33.098 --> 40:34.900
instantly aggressed
from the hail.

40:34.933 --> 40:39.437
[overlapping indistinct
radio communication]

40:46.077 --> 40:47.445
[man]
We have an E-3 in the air

40:47.479 --> 40:49.114
covering with FLIR.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.282
We could see 'em on visual.

40:51.316 --> 40:53.885
They were completely
invisible to radar.

40:53.919 --> 40:55.453
[Reynolds]
I was passed some information

40:55.487 --> 40:59.224
that said this was
Operation Snowbird.

40:59.257 --> 41:00.959
The information
this man gave me

41:00.992 --> 41:02.728
was code names,

41:02.761 --> 41:04.763
and Snowbird was diversion.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.501
[interviewer]
Can you tell us specifically
what Operation Snowbird is?

41:14.105 --> 41:15.473
In the event of a mass-sighting

41:15.507 --> 41:18.143
or an engagement
over a civilian-populated area,

41:18.176 --> 41:20.311
Operation Snowbird
would deploy

41:20.345 --> 41:22.413
deterrent measures
and diversionary tactics

41:22.447 --> 41:26.017
to... draw eyes away
from the combat zone.

41:26.051 --> 41:27.819
[interviewer]
A distraction operation?

41:29.521 --> 41:30.922
[man] Yeah.

41:30.956 --> 41:32.457
[interviewer]
So when the public saw
the lights over the city,

41:32.490 --> 41:34.192
they weren't seeing
the actual crafts?

41:35.927 --> 41:37.462
[man]
No.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.330
No, they were seeing
our flares.

41:42.333 --> 41:45.503
[interviewer]
Is it unusual to drop flares
over a populated area?

41:45.537 --> 41:47.138
I've already stated that we--

41:48.406 --> 41:51.276
Look, as Lieutenant
Colonel Jones stated
in his report,

41:51.309 --> 41:54.245
the events of March 13 were
a documented training exercise

41:54.279 --> 41:56.147
with the 104th
Fighter Squadron.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.750
[interviewer]
Is it unusual that A-10s
from another base

41:58.784 --> 42:01.519
would violate your airspace
without first contacting
your flight controller?

42:01.553 --> 42:03.288
Lieutenant Colonel Jones
and his men

42:03.321 --> 42:05.323
were well within their
area of operation.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.258
[interviewer]
And does this include
Operation Snowbird

42:07.292 --> 42:10.428
as a diversion exercise
over the Estrella Mountains?

42:10.461 --> 42:12.530
All right, we're going to
end this interview now.

42:13.699 --> 42:15.901
[indistinct whispering]

42:15.934 --> 42:18.203
At 2200 hours...

42:20.872 --> 42:23.374
...they cleared
the mountain line...

42:23.408 --> 42:25.343
...and that lead craft...

42:26.444 --> 42:28.079
...changed trajectory...

42:29.414 --> 42:31.950
...and engaged our fighters
head-on.

42:31.983 --> 42:34.119
[interviewer]
So what was going
through your mind?

42:34.152 --> 42:36.922
I had never seen anything
move so fast in my life.

42:36.955 --> 42:39.691
[jets roaring]

42:41.526 --> 42:44.529
[indistinct
radio communication]

43:03.581 --> 43:06.051
[electronic voice]
Warning. Warning.

43:06.084 --> 43:07.719
[beeping]

43:07.753 --> 43:10.055
[engine roaring]

43:11.322 --> 43:13.024
[indistinct question]

43:13.058 --> 43:16.394
[Mitch] I don't think so.
I mean, they're not supposed
to be able to move like that.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.129
Look, look, look,
look, look, look!

43:20.632 --> 43:21.800
[boom]

43:21.833 --> 43:24.102
[men shouting]
Whoa!

43:24.135 --> 43:26.037
- What the fuck was that?!
- What the hell was that?!

43:26.071 --> 43:27.405
What was that?

43:27.438 --> 43:29.407
Oh my God, man.
That's a pilot.

43:30.508 --> 43:32.277
Well, why did we shoot it down?

43:33.244 --> 43:34.713
Come on, we gotta go.

43:34.746 --> 43:37.148
[jets roaring]

43:38.283 --> 43:40.285
- What are you doing?!
- Enough. Listen, dude.

43:41.519 --> 43:42.954
[Mitch]
Everybody on.
Everybody on!

43:42.988 --> 43:45.590
[overlapping
indistinct dialogue]

43:45.623 --> 43:47.726
[A.T.V. engine starts]

43:47.759 --> 43:48.894
Where the fuck is it?!

43:48.927 --> 43:50.796
It was this way!
Somewhere over here!
Come on!

43:50.829 --> 43:52.664
They're looking
in the wrong place!

43:52.698 --> 43:54.099
Come on!

43:56.935 --> 43:58.870
- Can you see it?!
- It's on that mountain!

43:58.904 --> 44:00.772
It's right over there!
Look!

44:25.296 --> 44:26.698
[ominous ambience]

44:26.732 --> 44:28.133
Mitch...

44:29.667 --> 44:32.370
Wait, hang on, hang on.
Get down, get down.

44:32.403 --> 44:33.739
[indistinct whispering]

44:33.772 --> 44:35.941
- We need to turn around
right fucking now.
- Just hang on a second.

44:35.974 --> 44:37.843
It's a fucking pilot.
We can't leave him.

44:37.876 --> 44:39.244
Listen to him, man.
He's right.

44:39.277 --> 44:41.146
Okay, you've had your fun.
Let's get the fuck out--

44:41.179 --> 44:42.748
Look, if that is one of ours...

44:42.781 --> 44:44.349
...I'm not gonna leave him here.
You understand?

44:44.382 --> 44:45.951
One of ours?
What are you even
talking about, dude?

44:45.984 --> 44:47.753
If that's one of ours,
if that's military,

44:47.786 --> 44:48.954
then someone's
comin' after him.

44:48.987 --> 44:50.756
There's nobody else up here!
All right?

44:50.789 --> 44:52.457
This is our chance to save him.

44:52.490 --> 44:54.592
We don't know
what the hell that is.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.094
Just gonna see if he's okay.
All right?

44:56.127 --> 44:57.462
If he's fine,
we'll go back down,

44:57.495 --> 44:59.030
we'll get some help, all right?
It'll be fine!

44:59.064 --> 45:00.832
Who's fine?!
Who are you talking about?!

45:00.866 --> 45:02.667
The pilot, man!
God, he needs us!

45:02.700 --> 45:04.669
Okay, listen, no--
nobody needs us,

45:04.702 --> 45:07.005
and this is not the time
for you to play hero, okay?

45:07.038 --> 45:09.607
- What are you worried about?!
- What am I worried about?!

45:09.640 --> 45:11.810
I'm worried about him
going up there and getting
us all fucking killed

45:11.843 --> 45:13.711
where we shouldn't be
in the first fucking place!

45:13.745 --> 45:15.781
Listen, Mark is not up there,
okay?

45:15.814 --> 45:17.182
What the fuck
did you say to me?!

45:17.215 --> 45:18.583
[indistinct shouting]

45:18.616 --> 45:20.118
I'm gonna save
his fucking life!

45:20.151 --> 45:21.887
You wanna be a fucking baby?!
Fine!

45:21.920 --> 45:23.688
[overlapping
indistinct shouting]

45:23.721 --> 45:25.623
Sack of shit!
Fuck you, Ryan!

45:25.656 --> 45:26.925
Fuck!

45:26.958 --> 45:28.393
[indiscernible shout]

45:28.426 --> 45:29.527
We've gotta go.

45:29.560 --> 45:30.862
Get the fuck off me!

45:30.896 --> 45:32.030
[Glenn]
Come on, he's right.
Let's go.

45:32.063 --> 45:34.165
This is bullshit, okay?

45:34.199 --> 45:36.768
You're gonna leave him
up there alone?!
Come on!

45:36.802 --> 45:38.837
Man, this doesn't
make any sense.

45:38.870 --> 45:40.038
Doesn't make any fucking sense.

45:40.071 --> 45:41.840
- Come on!
- Mitch!

45:41.873 --> 45:43.374
Mitch!

45:43.408 --> 45:44.943
Ryan, man, Ryan!

They were scared.

45:52.583 --> 45:54.285

45:54.319 --> 45:56.021
We're talking about...

45:56.054 --> 45:59.090
...best trained pilots
in the world,
best equipment in the world...

45:59.124 --> 46:01.292
Doesn't matter.

46:01.326 --> 46:04.295
We were not prepared
for anything like this.

46:04.329 --> 46:05.396
Nobody is.

46:05.964 --> 46:07.498
[breathing deeply]

46:07.532 --> 46:09.067
[Jacob]
Can we fucking go now?

46:11.036 --> 46:12.938
[Mitch]
Come on, Jake,
a little further, buddy.

- Yeah.

46:31.756 --> 46:34.025
[ominous creaking sound]

46:34.059 --> 46:36.627
- Shh.
- Shut the fuck up.

46:36.661 --> 46:38.529
[creaking sound]

46:38.563 --> 46:40.765
That's gotta be
one of our jets, man.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.167
Did you guys see an ejection,
or anything?

46:42.200 --> 46:43.634
- No.
- No, nothing.

46:43.668 --> 46:45.470
Shut the fuck up.
Come on.

46:45.503 --> 46:47.105
[loud ominous creaking]

46:48.339 --> 46:49.841
Mitch, no, no, no, no!

46:49.875 --> 46:51.576
- Mitch!
- You stay here.

46:51.609 --> 46:52.810

47:12.497 --> 47:15.266
[pilot]
There was no heat signature.

47:15.300 --> 47:16.567
Our E-3 controllers

47:16.601 --> 47:20.071
were unable to find
the crash site
for 28 minutes.

47:21.339 --> 47:23.841
By the time we did
find the location...

47:25.143 --> 47:26.677
...it was too late.

47:58.776 --> 48:00.578
Shit, shit, shit!
Mitch!

48:01.546 --> 48:04.382
Come on, if they knew
they were trapped,

48:04.415 --> 48:06.384
wouldn't they have-
wouldn't they have
done something about it?

48:06.417 --> 48:07.953
This is the U.S. Military,
for Christ's sakes.

48:07.986 --> 48:09.988
They can do anything they want.

Jake, listen, buddy,
you're gonna be all right.

on one of the bikes, okay?

I don't think
that's a good idea.

Okay. All right.

Hold on.
Let's stay here for a second.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.622
[Jacob]
We never shouldn't fucking
come here.

50:24.655 --> 50:25.856
[Mitch]
I know.
I'm sorry, buddy.

50:25.890 --> 50:27.525
[Jacob, crying]
We gotta get out of here.

50:27.558 --> 50:29.927
[Mitch]
Listen to me.
Just hang in there, all right?

50:29.960 --> 50:32.697
We're gonna get through this.
I'm sorry, buddy.

50:32.730 --> 50:34.699
We gotta keep moving, though.
Okay?

50:34.732 --> 50:35.800
Can you walk?

50:35.833 --> 50:38.035
[crying]
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

50:38.069 --> 50:40.338
Jesus.
Uh, all right, listen.

50:40.371 --> 50:43.374
It's either stay, all right,
and wait for the sun,

50:43.408 --> 50:44.909
or we try for it.

50:44.942 --> 50:46.477

Then why did the men
return to the house?

59:20.658 --> 59:22.993
Geographically, it was the only
place within miles of them.

It was the only safe port
in the storm.

Shit.

You got my back.

You two go out the back,
get to the A.T.V.s.

I'll meet you there.
Okay?

All right?

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:11.701
I'm way faster without
you two bitches, anyway.

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:14.338

we could do for 'em.

About two weeks after the...

01:11:50.407 --> 01:11:52.241
...incident,
a captain from Davis-Monthan

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:53.577
made overtures
toward the press.

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:56.312
Apparently he was gonna bring
this story to their attention.

01:12:01.217 --> 01:12:02.486
About 72 hours later,

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:03.953
they found he
and his A-10 aircraft

01:12:03.987 --> 01:12:06.556
crashed into the side
of a Colorado mountainside.

01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:10.594

01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:14.330
...an equipment malfunction
and gross pilot error.

01:14:53.557 --> 01:14:55.925
[interviewer]
And the official
medical examiner report

01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:58.662
still lists the incident
as an animal attack?

01:15:05.902 --> 01:15:07.837
[man]
That monster took my son.

01:15:09.539 --> 01:15:11.340
He knew what he did,

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:12.842
and they're just as guilty
as he is

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:14.410
for not telling us.

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.015

And then it was over...

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:22.085
They just closed the case.

01:15:23.086 --> 01:15:25.622
It was like no one
would help us...

01:15:25.655 --> 01:15:28.357
...or even acknowledge
they existed.

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:30.927
Their case was never
brought to my attention,

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.696
and when I asked
about the incident

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:35.364
I was told,
"No more questions."

01:15:35.398 --> 01:15:38.067
And now I'll ask Officer Stein
and his colleagues

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:39.903
to escort the accused
into the room

01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:42.806

upon the guilty party.

The bottom line is
they lied to us.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.886

of what happened.

Now, as a parent,
I sympathize with them, but...

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.998
...in this case there's simply
not enough evidence

01:16:09.032 --> 01:16:11.300

but an animal attack

of March 13th, 1997,

of Paulden, Arizona...

as a giant,

over the Phoenix area.

in the air,

pick up nothing.

01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:49.125
...are their bodies?

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:51.327
*

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:53.917
Okay...

01:20:59.488 --> 01:21:00.723
Hello.

01:21:01.424 --> 01:21:04.860
My name is Walt Gayson...

01:21:04.894 --> 01:21:07.830
...and my joyous day
has finally come.

01:21:09.398 --> 01:21:12.501
My brothers and sisters
have all...

01:21:12.535 --> 01:21:14.938
...risen above this world

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:17.340
and left their vehicles behind.

01:21:18.341 --> 01:21:22.345
But today...
it's my turn.

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:24.447
...to follow the chosen ones...

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.449
...to the kingdom of Heaven.

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.096
It is time.

01:21:42.465 --> 01:21:44.934
[breathing heavily]

01:21:50.706 --> 01:21:52.308
[groaning]

01:21:52.341 --> 01:21:53.809
[screaming]
