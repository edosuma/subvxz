01:41.117 --> 01:43.119
Okay, we know
what we're gonna do.

01:43.119 --> 01:46.122
Till the government
indicts, anyway.

01:46.122 --> 01:49.626
Jimmy?
This answers your concerns?

01:49.626 --> 01:52.629
I think
a lot of good ground
was covered.

01:54.130 --> 01:56.633
Okay, i guess that's it.

01:56.633 --> 02:00.136
All right.

02:12.398 --> 02:15.401
You know, you better
get the tickets.
I got'em already. Don't worry.

02:15.401 --> 02:18.404
Fuck, the rangers
are gonna lose anyway.

02:20.406 --> 02:22.909
You're right, it's him.
All of a sudden,
he asks for a meeting...

02:22.909 --> 02:24.911
to discuss shit
we already covered.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.914
He's wearin' a wire.

02:27.914 --> 02:30.416
You got my okay.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.919
Make sure
you send a message
to everybody else.

02:32.919 --> 02:35.922
Done.

02:36.422 --> 02:40.927
See you later.

02:48.468 --> 02:51.971
Who was it that told me
you hated fuckin' russians?

02:51.971 --> 02:54.974
Ah, the two needle pricks
junior brought around
to pound my ass were russian.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.977
For a while i was bitter.
But tony'sgoumada
is russian.

02:57.977 --> 02:59.979
You couldn't ask
for a nicer person.

02:59.979 --> 03:02.482
These two tonight
are friends of hers.

03:02.482 --> 03:06.986
I got enough cologne on?
You smell like paco rabanne
crawled up your ass and died.

03:06.986 --> 03:10.490
Oh, easy for you to say.
I don't get young ones
like before.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.992
Well, you're gonna
be glad i got you
out of bed tonight.

03:12.992 --> 03:17.247
Russian boo- boo's, you go
for some basic foreplay,
they'll detail your car.

03:18.748 --> 03:21.751
How's the hygiene
over there?
I don't know.

03:21.751 --> 03:25.255
This is here.
You didn't even let me
put anything decent on.

03:25.255 --> 03:27.257
Here we are.

03:31.261 --> 03:34.264
Hi, elena, baby.
How are you?
Hey, okay.

03:34.264 --> 03:36.766
Is tatiana here?
I'll go get her.

03:39.769 --> 03:42.772
You are jimmy?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm jimmy.

03:47.777 --> 03:51.281
Oh! My man!

03:53.533 --> 03:56.536
Big tits, little feet.
A hit in any man's league.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.676
Have a seat.

04:13.303 --> 04:14.804
Fuckin' punk- ass
pieces of shit.

04:15.305 --> 04:18.308
- Did you forget i'm a captain?
- Why don't you call for help
in your radio mike?

04:18.808 --> 04:20.810
- You fuckin' rat.
- Mother of god!

04:20.810 --> 04:23.313
- What's the matter?
Not wearin' one tonight?
- Nah.

04:23.813 --> 04:26.316
- He didn't have time
to put on anything decent.
- God!

04:38.461 --> 04:41.965
Come on. Stop.
I want to watch.

04:46.469 --> 04:49.722
- Kiss me.
- Ha- ha, georgia o'keefe.

04:49.722 --> 04:54.227
Was that your back gate?

04:54.227 --> 04:57.230
Hmm, it's
probably nothing.

04:57.230 --> 05:00.733
Come here.
That's what people always
say in these creepy movies.

05:00.733 --> 05:06.239
And the last thing i need
is your parents come home and
your dad sees my dominican ass.

05:06.239 --> 05:09.742
Seti- i- imia!
Jesus fuck!

05:11.995 --> 05:15.615
I just saw my grandmother go by
the window. How'd she get here
from her nursing home?

05:20.870 --> 05:23.756
Settimia!

05:27.877 --> 05:32.015
Cakey! Tell my sister
to open the door.

05:32.015 --> 05:34.517
Grandma, it's me.
Anthony, junior.

05:34.517 --> 05:36.519
Well, you've got
whooping cough.

05:36.519 --> 05:40.523
- Get yourself
under the vaporizer.
- Holy shit.

05:43.142 --> 05:45.528
- Hey, what do you want, lady?
- Go away.

05:45.528 --> 05:49.532
I will never speak...

05:50.033 --> 05:54.037
another word to you
again, settimia.

05:54.537 --> 05:56.539
Grandma, aunt settimia's
dead. It's me, meadow.

05:57.040 --> 06:02.545
Facia bruta!
Grandma, it's meadow,
remember? Come sit down.

06:02.545 --> 06:06.049
Yes. Meadow.

06:06.549 --> 06:10.553
Ohh!
I can't stay in this house,
honeybunch.

06:10.553 --> 06:12.555
Not while thatfacia bruta
is in here.

06:15.058 --> 06:17.060
Come on, grandma.
Let's go see who it is.

06:21.564 --> 06:25.818
- Evening. How are we tonight?
- Make my sister get out
of the house.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.323
It's 1:00 a. M. , dear.
Why were you walking on
mountain avenue at this hour?

06:30.323 --> 06:32.825
Shut up.

06:32.825 --> 06:35.578
We got a complaint
from your neighbors
of a woman wandering.

06:35.578 --> 06:38.081
- She's my grandmother.
- Hi, grandma.

06:38.081 --> 06:40.583
Ahh!
How are you?

06:41.084 --> 06:43.586
- Ow, shit!
-
you know this young man?

06:43.586 --> 06:47.090
Of course. He's--

06:50.093 --> 06:52.095
he's my- my grandson.

06:52.595 --> 06:55.548
And is this
your house, dear?

07:01.938 --> 07:06.309
Where was she trying
to get to?
Schrafft's.

07:08.811 --> 07:11.314
She's being retested...
for alzheimer's.

07:11.314 --> 07:14.817
It's been a long odyssey
with your mother, hasn't it?

07:14.817 --> 07:17.954
Oh, these last 500 years
just seemed to race by.

07:20.573 --> 07:23.960
Listen to me.
- It's okay. -

07:25.828 --> 07:29.215
- let it out.
- They're transferring her
to the nursing unit.

07:30.716 --> 07:32.718
Which is...

07:32.718 --> 07:34.720
the thing that
she dreaded and feared.

07:35.087 --> 07:38.591
Isn't it interesting
how this memory loss
has cropped up...

07:38.975 --> 07:43.346
right after
you failed to be killed
in the carjacking?

07:43.346 --> 07:47.233
- You think
it was a carjacking?
- Course not.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.736
But i got an idea
who was behind it,

07:51.237 --> 07:53.739
and...

07:53.739 --> 07:55.741
'nuff said.

07:55.741 --> 07:58.995
- You don't want to go there.
- Maybe you don't want
to go there.

07:59.245 --> 08:01.747
What are you
talkin' about?
Well, let's track it.

08:02.114 --> 08:06.002
Right around the time
of the shooting, you were
having hallucinations...

08:06.002 --> 08:08.504
of that isabella figure?

08:09.005 --> 08:11.507
The "protective, loving"
mother?

08:12.508 --> 08:15.761
Your subconscious was
shouting something at you.

08:16.762 --> 08:18.764
On the day before the shooting,

08:19.265 --> 08:22.018
you said to me that
she kept going on...

08:22.018 --> 08:26.639
yet again about news stories
of mothers throwing their babies
out of windows.

08:27.139 --> 08:30.142
Why don't we put
our fuckin' cards
on the table here?

08:30.643 --> 08:34.647
Wh- what do you think, my mother
tried to have me whacked'cause
i put her in a nursing home?

08:34.897 --> 08:38.400
In your worst dreams,
a duck flies off
with your penis.

08:38.900 --> 08:41.904
- Castration.
- Hey, my mother never
went after my basket.

08:42.288 --> 08:44.790
No, not literally.

08:44.790 --> 08:50.296
Look, ordinarily
a patient is helped
to make his own breakthroughs.

08:50.663 --> 08:54.166
But your life is in danger,
so okay, i'm willing to put
the cards on the table.

08:54.667 --> 08:57.169
I say what your mother has,
at the very least,

08:57.670 --> 09:00.806
is what we call borderline
personality disorder.

09:01.057 --> 09:03.059
A borderline personality
disorder?

09:03.059 --> 09:07.430
Let me read to you
from the d. S. M. - Iv, okay?

09:07.430 --> 09:09.932
Definitions
of the condition?

09:09.932 --> 09:13.436
"A pattern of
unstable relationships.

09:13.936 --> 09:16.322
Affective instability."

09:16.322 --> 09:21.327
It means intense anxiety,
a joylessness.

09:21.694 --> 09:25.197
These people's internal phobias
are the only things
that exist to them.

09:25.197 --> 09:28.200
The real world,
real people are peripheral.

09:28.451 --> 09:31.954
These people have
no love or compassion.

09:31.954 --> 09:35.458
Borderline personalities are
very good at splitting behavior,

09:35.958 --> 09:41.347
creating bitterness and conflict
between others in their circle.

09:42.598 --> 09:44.600
You twisted fuckin' bitch.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.103
That's my mother we're
talkin' about, not some
fuck up in attica...

09:47.103 --> 09:49.605
stabbed you
in the shower.
Relax.

09:50.106 --> 09:52.608
See, we're through,
you and i.
We're finished.

09:52.608 --> 09:55.611
And you're lucky if i don't
break your fuckin' face
in 50, 000 pieces.

09:56.112 --> 09:58.614
Okay.

10:13.129 --> 10:16.048
I mean, let's face it,
jackie's work is
what killed him.

10:16.048 --> 10:18.050
All thatagita
brought on the disease.

10:18.050 --> 10:21.554
But his reign was peaceful.
This shooting with tony--

10:21.554 --> 10:24.056
suppose my jackie
hadn't died of cancer.

10:24.056 --> 10:26.559
Who knows how his life
would have ended?

10:26.559 --> 10:31.564
Look at angie bompensiero.
A fuckin' shell since
pussy disappeared.

10:31.931 --> 10:34.934
Ladies,
compliments of the house!

10:34.934 --> 10:36.936
Buccetin"matriciana.

10:36.936 --> 10:39.822
Artie, you want
a pair of hippos
to walk outta here?

10:40.072 --> 10:42.074
That's imported pancetta
in there!

10:42.575 --> 10:45.578
You gonna hate me, artie,
if i say i like this place
better than the old vesuvio?

10:45.945 --> 10:49.448
A few bugs to be ironed out.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.951
And the one in your salad,
that was a freak occurrence.

10:51.951 --> 10:54.453
My produce man,
he's the most expensive
in the area.

10:54.954 --> 10:57.957
The insurance
really came through!

10:58.457 --> 11:00.960
- Yes, it did.
- Carm, what do i hear
about tony's mom?

11:01.344 --> 11:04.597
- Chiara was talkin'
to meadow in school.
- Yeah, looks like alzheimer's.

11:04.597 --> 11:07.099
Oh, boy.
Yeah.

11:07.099 --> 11:10.603
Aw, i've known
mrs."s" since--

11:10.603 --> 11:15.474
she's always been a--
an individualist,
should we say? Huh?

11:15.608 --> 11:19.612
But she's a real pistol.
What a character!

11:19.612 --> 11:23.115
- Aw, poor tony.
- Yeah, he's beside himself.

11:23.616 --> 11:26.118
He's got a lot
on his plate.

11:26.118 --> 11:30.239
The attempted carjacking--

11:30.239 --> 11:34.243
- hey, well--
- i'll let you eat.

11:34.243 --> 11:36.746
Okay. Enjoy!
Thanks, artie.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.753
Oh, my god,
look who's here!

11:44.754 --> 11:46.756
What?
You hiding back here?

11:46.756 --> 11:49.258
Your best friend's
on table 12.

11:49.258 --> 11:51.761
When are you gonna
bury the hatchet?

11:51.761 --> 11:54.263
Arthur, i love carmela
like a sister.

11:54.263 --> 11:57.266
We just don't want
this place to become
another mob hangout...

11:57.266 --> 11:59.268
like the old vesuvio.

11:59.268 --> 12:01.270
Get it into your head
that a certain amount...

12:01.270 --> 12:04.273
of that kind of patronage
creates "buzz."

12:04.273 --> 12:08.277
Artie, that kind of buzz
we should avoid in droves.

12:14.283 --> 12:17.286
Sh- it!

12:17.286 --> 12:20.423
- Your first time here?
- The dellacroces gave me
a gift certificate.

12:20.923 --> 12:22.925
It's part of artie's
opening promotion.

12:23.175 --> 12:25.678
- You will notbelievethe food.
- That's what i hear.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.681
Although they'd have
to be doing something
pretty special back there...

12:28.681 --> 12:30.683
to trump you two ladies
at the spice rack.

12:31.183 --> 12:34.437
I was over at carmela's
the other night, ro.

12:34.437 --> 12:38.441
We had somezabaglion'that--
well, now, of course,
we did make it together.

12:38.441 --> 12:40.443
But everybody was
just raving about it.

12:40.443 --> 12:44.313
Please, you made it,
basically.

12:44.313 --> 12:49.819
I only wish tony had
taken me up on my offer to talk
to him about the carjacking.

12:49.819 --> 12:53.322
- Well, that makes two of us.
- Yeah.

12:53.322 --> 12:55.825
Well, i better
get seated and order.

12:56.325 --> 12:59.328
No, wait, wait.
Stay here.
Take a load off.

12:59.328 --> 13:01.330
Yeah.
H- how's the watch,
father phil?

13:01.330 --> 13:03.332
Oh, it's fantastic.

13:03.332 --> 13:07.586
I realized this morning
i can set one of the dials
to the millennial countdown.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.589
- Well, i haven't done it yet.
- Is that jackie's watch?

13:17.980 --> 13:19.482
Thanks again, ro.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.625
Mr. Soprano was kind enough
to come with us.

13:46.625 --> 13:49.128
Yeah, when you
threatened to wait
until my kids got home.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.130
I'm sure
agent harris explained...

13:51.130 --> 13:53.632
that there's something
we'd like you to hear.

13:54.133 --> 13:57.520
The springsteen boxed set.
I already got it.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.022
- You know agent grasso,
i believe?
- Yeah, how are you doin'?

14:00.022 --> 14:02.525
Have a seat.

14:07.029 --> 14:10.282
As we both know,
there's been an attempt
on your life.

14:10.282 --> 14:12.284
You have enemies.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.787
I'd say it's a safe assumption
that you may have...

14:14.787 --> 14:17.790
finally run out your string
here in north jersey.

14:17.790 --> 14:21.293
The lovely agent harris and i
have had this conversation.
I'll pass.

14:21.293 --> 14:23.796
You haven't heard
what's on the tape.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.298
Play it, 'cause
i don't give a fuck
what's on it.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.801
I understand you
and agent grasso...

14:28.801 --> 14:32.304
had an interesting colloquy
about our, uh, shared heritage.

14:32.304 --> 14:35.808
- Colla- who?
- You and i are
notcompare, tony.

14:35.808 --> 14:39.311
You on the one hand,
me and agent grasso
on the other,

14:39.311 --> 14:43.315
even though our ancestors
all hailed from the same
sunny peninsula.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.318
What the fuck
is your problem?

14:47.820 --> 14:50.322
But we do share
some cultural ideas.

14:50.322 --> 14:55.828
Religious, culinary,
matriarchal--

14:55.828 --> 14:58.330
maybe we can motivate you
to testify.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.833
Why don't you get
the kumquats out of your mouth
and get to the fuckin' point,

15:00.833 --> 15:03.335
because i don't know
what you're talkin' about.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.460
Boy, anthony must've really
gotten under your collar.

15:11.460 --> 15:15.965
Admit it. You're lookin'
to crack hiscoglionifor
puttin' you in here.

15:15.965 --> 15:18.968
I- i don't know what
you're talkin' about.

15:19.218 --> 15:22.688
Yeah. And i'm playin'
shortstop for the mets.

15:23.055 --> 15:28.060
A psychiatrist. He's been
seein' one for a while now.

15:30.062 --> 15:32.564
God only knows
what he says.

15:33.065 --> 15:35.567
You wired green grove.
You must have
taken me for an idiot.

15:35.567 --> 15:37.569
It was my idea.

15:37.569 --> 15:39.571
Everyone else thought
it was a waste of money.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.958
My cousin cakey,

15:42.958 --> 15:45.961
after he had his lobotomy,
looked exactly like my son.

15:45.961 --> 15:48.414
Livia--
empty, a shell.

15:48.914 --> 15:50.883
Better cakey had died
than go on living like that.

15:50.883 --> 15:54.887
That's what his own mother
always used to say.

16:04.763 --> 16:07.516
What are you talking
about, meetings? Well, who,
for christ's sake, livia?

16:07.516 --> 16:11.020
All of them.
Raymond.

16:11.520 --> 16:14.606
- Larry.
- Three of my capos have
their mothers in this place?

16:15.107 --> 16:18.610
If this is true, livia,
you know what i--

16:18.610 --> 16:21.113
i mean, i'm the boss,
for christ's sake.
If i don't act--

16:21.113 --> 16:24.116
blood or no--

16:24.116 --> 16:26.618
i have to.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.776
Mrs."s."

16:50.776 --> 16:53.028
How are you?

16:55.397 --> 16:57.399
You remember me?

16:58.901 --> 17:02.404
Arthur bucco?
That's right.

17:02.404 --> 17:06.040
- Victoria's boy!
- That's right.

17:06.040 --> 17:11.046
Yeah, you and my johnny
used to play little league
together.

17:11.046 --> 17:14.665
No, johnny was yourhusband.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.667
But you're right
about the little league.

17:16.667 --> 17:21.807
- That was me andtony.
- My son. That's right.

17:22.057 --> 17:24.560
Yeah.

17:24.675 --> 17:29.181
Aw, gee, what's
the matter with me?

17:30.682 --> 17:35.187
- How are you?
- Well, how are you, arthur?

17:35.687 --> 17:37.940
Never been better.

17:39.942 --> 17:45.447
It's a nice room.
Lots of sun!

17:45.447 --> 17:47.950
Yeah.
Oh, sit down.

17:48.450 --> 17:49.952
How's your mother?

17:50.452 --> 17:53.705
- You call her every day?
- Mom passed away.

17:53.839 --> 17:57.960
Really?
When?

17:58.961 --> 18:02.464
About six months ago.

18:02.848 --> 18:05.851
Please,
give her my regards.

18:05.851 --> 18:09.354
Is she still on
that crazy diet?

18:14.860 --> 18:17.863
I, uh,
i brought you something.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.865
Um, from my restaurant.

18:19.865 --> 18:24.119
- I don't know
if you remember vesuvio?
- Oh, of course i do.

18:24.119 --> 18:26.622
That was way back
when your dad had it.

18:27.122 --> 18:28.624
Good for you!

18:29.124 --> 18:31.627
Yeah, i got
a new restaurant.

18:33.629 --> 18:36.131
Here you go.

18:37.633 --> 18:39.635
Gavadel!

18:39.635 --> 18:43.639
With the nice duck ragout.
Homemade. It's northern.

18:43.639 --> 18:47.643
Oh, northern.

18:52.014 --> 18:55.517
Mrs."s,"
what's the matter?

18:56.902 --> 19:02.024
- Is it something i said? -

19:02.024 --> 19:07.029
you're a good boy, arthur,
comin' to visit me.

19:07.279 --> 19:12.784
We go back a ways.
You made a mean p. B. And j.

19:12.784 --> 19:16.038
After what
my son did to you--

19:16.038 --> 19:19.041
oh, how can i look you
in the face?

19:19.424 --> 19:20.926
Tony?

19:21.426 --> 19:22.928
What did he do now?

19:23.428 --> 19:26.298
Y- you don't blame him
for setting the fire?

19:28.800 --> 19:32.271
Well, you're
a bigger man than some.

19:32.638 --> 19:35.641
Well, we should all
be grateful that...

19:35.641 --> 19:38.644
nobody was
incinerated to death.

19:48.237 --> 19:52.241
Altieri's wake is tonight.
I phoned in
a bomb scare.

19:52.241 --> 19:54.243
You know,
that's over the top.

20:01.750 --> 20:04.253
It was junior and mikey
that definitely
took out the hit.

20:04.753 --> 20:07.256
- Start things movin'.
- Not like we didn't know.

20:07.256 --> 20:10.759
- How did you find out for sure?
- No room for interpretation.

20:10.759 --> 20:13.762
Minchia.
"T," i'm sorry.

20:13.762 --> 20:15.764
Your own uncle.
Now, let's do it right.

20:17.266 --> 20:19.768
Act normal.
Plan things out.

20:19.768 --> 20:22.271
- Make no mistakes.
- If i'm your uncle,

20:22.271 --> 20:24.773
i gotta finish
what i started.

20:24.773 --> 20:29.278
He can strike first.
Yeah, and he won't use
boys 2 menthis time.

20:29.278 --> 20:32.281
- He'll go with what he knows.
- Chucky signore.

20:32.281 --> 20:34.283
No, mikey's now
too high up.

20:34.283 --> 20:37.286
So, chucky's gotta
disappear without
settin' off any alarms.

20:38.287 --> 20:41.290
I just passed
my coast guard tests.

20:43.292 --> 20:46.795
"T." anything else?

20:46.795 --> 20:49.798
My ear hurts.

21:00.692 --> 21:02.694
Here.
One of mine.

21:02.694 --> 21:04.696
It'll help you sleep.

21:07.699 --> 21:11.203
What kinda person can i be,
where his own mother
wants him dead?

21:15.707 --> 21:17.709
The problem
is not with you.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.711
That woman is
a peculiar duck.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.214
She always has been.

21:22.714 --> 21:26.718
Yeah, but that's
not the point.
She's gotten worse with age.

21:26.718 --> 21:28.720
You think my mother
didn't warn me about her
on my wedding night?

21:28.720 --> 21:30.722
Please, don't start
with that again.

21:30.722 --> 21:33.225
Your sisters left
new jersey so young
you would have thought...

21:33.225 --> 21:35.727
there were contracts
out on them!

21:35.727 --> 21:39.231
I know.
But you
were different.

21:39.231 --> 21:42.234
You tried
to make it work.

21:44.236 --> 21:47.239
Two pricks
with nine millimeters.

21:47.239 --> 21:50.742
My self- esteem is
nonexistent right now.

21:51.243 --> 21:53.245
Well, i could kill her.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.747
With these two hands.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.749
The next time i see her,
it's gonna be--

21:58.250 --> 21:59.751
you gotta play
"the concerned daughter- in- law."

22:00.252 --> 22:04.256
You gotta stay even- keeled,
for the sake of the business.
Fuck the business!

22:04.256 --> 22:08.260
And let me tell you something,
tony, dollars to donuts this
alzheimer's thing is an act,

22:08.260 --> 22:10.762
so she can't be called
on her shit.

22:15.267 --> 22:18.770
Uncle jun and i,
we had our problems.
With the business.

22:18.770 --> 22:21.273
But i never
should have asked him
about eatin' pussy.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.775
This whole war
could have been averted.

22:24.276 --> 22:27.279
Cunnilingus and psychiatry
brought us to this!

22:27.279 --> 22:31.283
You had to see a shrink
because of the mother
you had.

22:33.285 --> 22:36.788
When i look at the guys now,
all i feel is humiliation.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.794
I'll take care
of my uncle.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.297
And i'll take care
of mikey "p."

22:45.797 --> 22:49.301
And i'll get
some satisfaction.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.303
But inside,

22:52.304 --> 22:54.306
i'll know.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.325
Ton'!
Jesus christ, relax.

23:13.325 --> 23:14.943
- What the fuck
you doin' here?
- Takin' thestugatz.

23:15.444 --> 23:17.446
- Puttin' it in
the marina next door.
- No shit.

23:17.946 --> 23:20.332
Look at this baby i caught
right off the point here.

24:17.889 --> 24:21.510
- Just wait a minute.
Wait. All right, wait.
- Oh, no! No!

24:21.510 --> 24:26.148
- Look, look,
i need to talk to you!
- No!

24:26.148 --> 24:29.151
Come on!

24:29.151 --> 24:32.154
I'm dialing 9- 1- 1.

24:32.154 --> 24:34.656
Because you've given me
no choice.

24:35.157 --> 24:36.658
Come on!

24:37.159 --> 24:41.163
If anything happens to me,
they're gonna hear everything.

24:41.163 --> 24:43.165
Look, you wanna talk,
we'll go down
to the coffee shop.

24:43.165 --> 24:47.169
- Plenty of people around.
- Emergency services.
May i help you?

24:47.669 --> 24:49.671
Hey!
I need to talk to you.

24:49.671 --> 24:54.176
Do i have your word that
i'm in no physical danger?

24:54.176 --> 24:56.678
Yes. I am humbled
that you would take
my word. Yes.

24:56.678 --> 25:00.682
- What?
- Aw, fuck me. Yes!
You've got my word!

25:00.682 --> 25:04.186
Emergency services. State
the nature of your emergency.
Come on!

25:04.186 --> 25:07.189
Hello? Hello?

25:20.702 --> 25:22.704
Oh, god!

25:26.575 --> 25:30.078
I take no pleasure
in the fact that i was
right about your mother.

25:32.214 --> 25:34.716
You have any dreams since
you heard the f. B. I. Tapes?

25:34.833 --> 25:36.835
No.

25:41.339 --> 25:43.842
Some sex dreams.

25:45.343 --> 25:49.981
Involving--
my neighbor.
Jeanne cusamano.

25:51.983 --> 25:54.352
- Go on.
- Well, we're doin' it,
doggie- sty--

25:56.855 --> 26:00.242
- you know jeanne.
- That's okay. Go on.

26:01.743 --> 26:05.247
I'm doin' her
doggie- style.

26:05.247 --> 26:09.751
And i finish, you know,
and her big ass is--

26:09.751 --> 26:12.120
oh, look, we don't
got time for this shit.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.122
It's interesting
that you would say
a big ass,

26:14.122 --> 26:16.625
'cause jeanne
is quite slender.

26:16.758 --> 26:19.261
We got bigger things
to talk about than
jeanne cusamano's ass.

26:19.377 --> 26:23.381
Like feelings of worthlessness,
sparked by your mother's plot
to have you killed?

26:23.632 --> 26:25.634
One of the reasons
that they tried to
have me clipped...

26:26.134 --> 26:28.136
is'cause
i'm seeing a shrink.

26:28.136 --> 26:30.772
- You.
- Oh.

26:31.139 --> 26:32.641
Uh.

26:32.641 --> 26:35.026
You know that
patient- doctor conversation
is privileged,

26:35.527 --> 26:38.029
and i couldn't testify
against anybody.

26:38.396 --> 26:41.900
Well, maybe they know that,
and maybe they don't.

26:41.900 --> 26:44.786
Either way, they're using it
as a fuckin' excuse.

26:44.786 --> 26:48.290
You never mentioned
any of your associates
by name!

26:48.290 --> 26:51.793
All except for that,
uh, one fellow,
uh, booty?

26:51.910 --> 26:56.047
- Pussy. Pussy!
- Pussy, booty--
i don't know his last name!

26:57.549 --> 26:59.050
And look,
anything concerning
your uncle junior--

26:59.551 --> 27:04.055
all right,
shut the fuck up a minute.
You're in danger.

27:04.422 --> 27:07.175
Get outta here!
That's not fair!

27:07.175 --> 27:09.811
Fair? What are you talking
about, fair? They don't
give a shit about fair.

27:12.814 --> 27:15.317
Okay, what am i
supposed to do?

27:15.317 --> 27:18.820
Leave town.
Today. Right now.

27:18.820 --> 27:22.324
I'm gonna get some guys here
to stay with you
until you get on a plane.

27:22.324 --> 27:24.826
I can't just do that!
Lam it!

27:24.826 --> 27:28.330
- I have a life!
I have patients!
- Tell'em august came early.

27:28.446 --> 27:30.448
It doesn't work that way.

27:30.448 --> 27:32.450
I have patients
who are suicidal.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.586
They're not gonna feel
any better about their life
if you get clipped.

27:34.953 --> 27:39.457
- Jesus fucking christ!
- Look, i know.

27:39.457 --> 27:41.459
I'm sorry, okay?

27:41.459 --> 27:43.962
I'm gonna work
on this problem with the people
that pose a threat to you,

27:43.962 --> 27:46.965
and i'll take care
of it, and you'll be
able to come back.

27:47.349 --> 27:52.854
My god.
People are gonna get
murdered, aren't they?

27:52.971 --> 27:56.474
Don't worry about distractions.
You keep your eye on the ball.

27:56.474 --> 27:59.611
- I know what you're thinkin'.
- You have no idea
what i'm thinking.

27:59.728 --> 28:02.731
You're thinkin' you're
gonna go to the cops! But you
can't give them anything.

28:05.483 --> 28:08.486
Don't be stupid.
Even in the short term.

28:08.620 --> 28:11.623
Get the fuck out of town.

28:15.627 --> 28:18.129
You been a good doctor
to me. Thank you.

28:30.225 --> 28:32.227
Artie, how's your rash?

28:36.731 --> 28:38.733
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- How could you?

28:39.234 --> 28:42.604
- How the fuck couldyou--
- you took their money?

28:44.489 --> 28:47.492
Good, then do it.
Do it, 'cause i don't
give a fuck anymore.

28:47.992 --> 28:50.495
That restaurant
was like my child.

28:50.862 --> 28:53.364
So they got in your ear.
Three generations...

28:53.748 --> 28:57.752
of buccos sweated over
that same stove.

28:57.752 --> 28:59.754
Even your mother
treasures the memory
of vesuvio.

29:03.758 --> 29:05.760
My mother?

29:06.010 --> 29:09.013
Oh, don't say
she's lying, ton.
Because why would she?

29:09.380 --> 29:12.884
What'd she tell you,
my mother?
Don't make it worse.

29:14.385 --> 29:16.387
Do me the respect
of not treating me...

29:16.387 --> 29:18.890
like a fuckin' idiot
piece of shit.

29:21.776 --> 29:26.281
When you blew up the restaurant,
you made me party
to a criminal conspiracy.

29:26.281 --> 29:28.283
Did you ever stop
to think about that?

29:28.399 --> 29:33.037
I don't know what
she told you, my mother--
of all people--

29:35.290 --> 29:37.292
two arson investigators
gave that fire
a clean bill of health, artie.

29:37.792 --> 29:41.045
- Why the fuck would i
blow up your restaurant?
- To help me!

29:41.045 --> 29:44.048
You fuckin' bent psycho.

29:44.165 --> 29:46.668
You hear your uncle's
gonna hurt my business...

29:46.801 --> 29:50.305
by stagin' a hit
in my place, and
that's your solution?

29:50.305 --> 29:53.308
To burn it down
for the insurance money!

29:56.177 --> 29:59.180
What kind of stupid,
sick, twisted logic?

29:59.180 --> 30:04.819
All right.
Ask yourself a question:
Am i that fuckin' stupid?

30:05.069 --> 30:08.823
Huh?
Am i that fuckin' stupid?

30:08.940 --> 30:10.942
Really?

30:14.195 --> 30:18.700
My mother,
god bless her,

30:19.200 --> 30:21.703
is goin' senile, artie.

30:22.203 --> 30:26.207
- I mean, you saw.
- I loved my new place so much.

30:27.959 --> 30:30.461
And this ruins everything.

30:32.964 --> 30:35.466
I swear to god...

30:35.466 --> 30:38.469
i didn't touch
your place, artie.

30:38.469 --> 30:42.473
My mother was confused.

30:42.607 --> 30:45.109
Look me in the eye.

30:45.109 --> 30:49.731
Tell me you didn't lay
a finger on my place.

30:51.733 --> 30:55.236
I didn't burn down
your restaurant.

30:55.236 --> 30:58.239
I swear on my mother.

31:07.999 --> 31:10.635
Take it easy!

31:10.635 --> 31:12.637
What the fuck
are you doin'?

31:24.399 --> 31:26.401
Come on. Look out!
You could--

31:33.408 --> 31:35.910
it's good we can
get together, you know,
for our regular sunday dinner.

31:35.910 --> 31:39.414
Or somebody's nose
could get out of joint.

31:41.666 --> 31:44.419
Joint!

31:46.421 --> 31:48.423
You've got to admit it, ma,

31:48.673 --> 31:51.175
it's a nice nursing unit
where they let you be signed
out for family occasions.

31:51.175 --> 31:53.177
I don't have to
admit anything.

31:53.544 --> 31:55.930
- I gotta leave in ten minutes.
- Meadow!

31:55.930 --> 31:57.932
Well, i don't want
dessert, and i have
to study with hunter.

31:57.932 --> 32:00.935
- Is this pork cooked?
-
kids are growin' up.

32:01.185 --> 32:03.688
Gonna be
out of the house soon.

32:04.188 --> 32:06.057
- Even goo- gootz over there.
- If you believe
she's going to study,

32:06.441 --> 32:11.195
- i got a bridge to sell you.
- I read last week
in the paper...

32:11.312 --> 32:13.314
about this family
in "saint luis" obispo.

32:13.815 --> 32:16.818
In california.

32:16.818 --> 32:19.320
That whole family died
of trichinosis.

32:19.320 --> 32:22.206
That's uncooked pork.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.709
That was last year.
That same family.

32:25.076 --> 32:28.329
Listen to him.
He knows everything.

32:34.469 --> 32:36.721
So, uncle jun, what do
you hear from your lawyer
on the big thing?

32:37.221 --> 32:40.224
Hey, on and on it goes.
Ma, don't you agree...

32:40.591 --> 32:42.593
they should not talk business
at the table?

32:42.593 --> 32:44.846
What's goin' on
in your little corner
of the world?

32:44.846 --> 32:48.349
- Such as?
- I don't know.
The state of the union?

32:50.735 --> 32:53.354
So, i hear artie bucco
came to see you.

32:53.354 --> 32:55.857
Who is artie?

33:00.495 --> 33:03.614
- Friend of mine,
from elementary school. -

33:03.614 --> 33:06.117
he owns a restaurant.

33:06.617 --> 33:10.121
They had
a little fire in it.
He came to see me?

33:10.121 --> 33:13.624
Where? Wh- where--
where are we talkin' about?
Here?

33:26.137 --> 33:29.357
I've lost faith in everything.

33:29.357 --> 33:32.860
You moved away from god
quite some time ago, though.

33:32.860 --> 33:38.483
Is it fair to say it's
not just this recent crisis?
Yeah. Back in high school.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.487
Maybe before.

33:42.987 --> 33:46.991
I- i bring the kids
here on holidays,
but my mind wanders.

33:47.375 --> 33:50.378
I just...stare
at the stained glass,

33:50.378 --> 33:52.880
people's hats--

33:52.880 --> 33:56.384
i'm full of rage, father.

33:56.884 --> 33:59.387
Murderous...whatever...

33:59.387 --> 34:01.889
urges.

34:01.889 --> 34:07.395
I don't just hate this man.
I hate all men.

34:09.147 --> 34:11.516
I hate life.

34:11.649 --> 34:14.152
Have you talked
with your wife?

34:14.152 --> 34:16.654
I can't.
Why?

34:17.155 --> 34:19.657
Oh, what
it would do to her.

34:19.657 --> 34:22.659
She's been through
so much.

34:22.659 --> 34:24.911
Charmaine's a strong woman.

34:25.413 --> 34:28.416
Anyway, she's going
to find out in the course
of the investigation.

34:29.917 --> 34:34.922
I, uh-- i didn't go
to the insurance company.

34:35.422 --> 34:39.427
Why not?
Well, legally,
what if i'm wrong?

34:39.927 --> 34:41.929
I could get hit
with a defamation suit.

34:41.929 --> 34:46.434
Arthur, you know what
your heart is telling you.

34:48.436 --> 34:50.438
I think the only reason
you haven't told charmaine...

34:50.438 --> 34:54.442
is because you know
she'll insist you go
to the police immediately.

34:54.442 --> 34:59.564
And this will jeopardize
your restaurant.
Everything.

35:00.064 --> 35:02.567
You must be strong.

35:06.070 --> 35:08.072
All due respect,
father,

35:08.573 --> 35:10.074
you're getting
off the subject.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.715
Sorry i'm fuckin' late.

35:19.217 --> 35:21.219
Okay.

35:21.219 --> 35:23.721
I need to tell you
something.

35:24.222 --> 35:27.725
And i want you should
hear it from me, not from
some asshole in the street.

35:33.231 --> 35:35.733
About four or five
months ago,

35:35.733 --> 35:37.735
i started seein'
a psychiatrist.

35:39.737 --> 35:44.242
You know, i was
passin' out, and uh,
they couldn't find nothin'.

35:45.743 --> 35:47.745
She's been helpin' me
with that.

35:55.753 --> 35:58.756
Okay, come on.
Give it to me!
Give it to my face.

36:03.261 --> 36:07.765
Well, i'm sure you did it
with complete discretion.

36:09.767 --> 36:13.271
And, uh, speakin' for pussy,
if he's still alive,

36:13.771 --> 36:15.773
i'm sure he would agree.

36:15.773 --> 36:18.776
Business was not discussed.
No names were mentioned.

36:22.780 --> 36:25.283
Junior knows.

36:25.283 --> 36:27.285
He's decided
to use it against me.

36:35.042 --> 36:38.045
Ask now.
'Cause we're not
discussing this again.

36:41.048 --> 36:44.552
It's not the worst thing
i ever heard.

36:44.552 --> 36:47.555
I was seein' a therapist
myself about a year ago.

36:52.059 --> 36:55.062
I had some issues.
Enough said.

36:55.062 --> 36:57.064
I learned
some copin' skills.

36:57.064 --> 37:01.068
Look, uh,
this thing of ours,

37:01.569 --> 37:04.071
the way it's goin'--

37:04.071 --> 37:08.075
it'd be better if
we could admit to each other,
uh, these are...

37:08.075 --> 37:12.079
painful, stressful times.

37:14.081 --> 37:16.083
But it'll never
fuckin' happen.

37:18.586 --> 37:21.589
What about you?
You got a problem
with this?

37:21.589 --> 37:24.592
Uh--

37:27.595 --> 37:30.097
what was it like,
marriage counseling?

37:32.099 --> 37:36.103
Yeah, like that.
Sort of, yeah.

37:49.367 --> 37:52.236
The contra commandant was
trying to scare us priests.

37:52.737 --> 37:55.239
That's so dangerous
down there.

37:56.624 --> 37:59.126
Mm! Aw--

37:59.126 --> 38:04.131
oh, the fresh basil
really adds to it.

38:04.131 --> 38:06.133
Mm- hmm. Mm- hmm.
Yeah?

38:07.134 --> 38:09.136
Mm.
Oh, father,
you got a little--

38:09.136 --> 38:11.138
mm, thanks.
...mess here.

38:11.138 --> 38:13.007
You want a little bit?
No, please.

38:13.391 --> 38:17.395
I have so much at home.
And so,
how are the twins, rosalie?

38:32.026 --> 38:34.028
We should start with,
"would you like a cocktail,

38:34.528 --> 38:38.032
or see the wine list?"
Yeah, sure.

38:38.032 --> 38:40.418
I'll do it however you like.
On my other job,
the waiters usually do...

38:40.918 --> 38:45.423
the cocktail solicitation,
but if you want, i'll do it
as i seat them.

38:45.423 --> 38:47.925
Good. Great.
Thanks!
All right.

38:50.795 --> 38:52.797
She catches on fast,
that one.

38:52.797 --> 38:57.802
Very conscientious.
She's workin' two jobs,
to become a music manager.

38:57.802 --> 38:59.804
Whatever that is.

39:00.304 --> 39:04.809
Everything is goin' so good.

39:07.311 --> 39:09.814
The new exterminators?
I got faith.

39:09.814 --> 39:12.817
The owner is portuguese.
They're sticklers.

39:14.318 --> 39:17.321
I feel so wonderful
we're up and running again.

39:17.321 --> 39:20.825
Oh, you said you had
something to tell me.

39:23.327 --> 39:26.330
I like the bar stools.

39:35.473 --> 39:37.475
You're in a good mood
today, dad.

39:46.984 --> 39:49.987
And if chucky calls,
you get me on the cell phone.

39:49.987 --> 39:52.990
Ho!
You hear me?

39:52.990 --> 39:55.993
Yeah, okay. I think that
i heard you, already.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.995
Go take a midol.

40:21.886 --> 40:24.889
Nipps. Nipps!

40:24.889 --> 40:27.641
Jeez.
Bad boy!

41:18.826 --> 41:21.829
- You prick! -

41:29.086 --> 41:31.088
yeow! Motherfucker!

41:38.095 --> 41:41.098
Ow! You son of a bitch!
Oh, come on. Please.

41:41.098 --> 41:43.717
Please. Come on.
Come on!

41:43.968 --> 41:47.721
Oh, come on!
Come on, please!
Please!

41:48.222 --> 41:50.224
Fuckin' poison ivy
all over.

41:51.976 --> 41:54.478
My friend brendan,
you shot him
in his bathtub naked.

41:54.979 --> 41:57.481
- No chance to run.
- No! I swear to god!

41:57.481 --> 42:00.868
- It wasn't me, it was junior.
He hated that kid.
- Yeah, right. It was junior.

42:00.868 --> 42:05.623
- Mister magoo.
- Oh, come on!
Please! Please, please.

42:06.123 --> 42:08.125
I can feel it
itching me already!

42:36.654 --> 42:39.156
Corrado soprano?
F. B. I.
Fuck.

42:45.779 --> 42:49.533
Are you lawrence barese?
Aw, what the fuck.
Go on.

42:50.534 --> 42:53.537
Joseph sasso,
you're under arrest.
Fuck.

42:53.671 --> 42:56.674
Junior soprano, alleged boss of
the new jersey crime family...

42:56.674 --> 43:01.178
that bears his name,
was indicted today on
federal racketeering charges.

43:01.428 --> 43:03.931
F. B. I. And local police--
talk about fuckin' timing.

43:03.931 --> 43:08.936
- He's lucky he's still alive.
- ...along with
lawrence "larry boy" barese,

43:09.303 --> 43:14.308
ailing alleged underboss
joseph "beppy" sasso, and
13 other reputed mob figures.

43:14.692 --> 43:17.311
Oh, my god.
It's uncle junior.

43:17.311 --> 43:20.814
Yeah. Look at the old guy.
Makin' him do the perp walk.

43:20.814 --> 43:23.951
- A legitimate businessman.
- Dad, cut the crap.

43:23.951 --> 43:25.953
Go blow- dry your hair.

43:25.953 --> 43:29.206
These indictments are part of
an ongoing investigation,

43:29.206 --> 43:31.709
stretching back
nearly four years.

43:31.709 --> 43:34.962
They represent
the most crippling blow
to mob activities...

43:35.329 --> 43:39.967
in the new jersey area
since the early 1980s.

43:39.967 --> 43:42.836
Uncle junior got busted.

43:42.836 --> 43:44.838
Cool.

43:44.838 --> 43:46.840
Not seized today, although
named in the indictments,

43:46.840 --> 43:52.596
was alleged soprano enforcer
and loan sharking chief,
michael "grab bag" palmice.

43:53.097 --> 43:57.601
Authorities believe palmice may
have fled the new jersey area,
acting on prior knowledge.

43:57.851 --> 43:59.853
Oh, lucky him!
Earlier today,

43:59.987 --> 44:02.489
palmice's wife
denied any knowledge of
her husband's whereabouts.

44:03.490 --> 44:05.993
Yeah, he was, uh,
he was so happy.

44:05.993 --> 44:09.496
He was going out
to try out these
new running shoes.

44:09.496 --> 44:13.617
You know, he told me
that he loved me,

44:13.617 --> 44:15.619
and that he would
be right back!

44:15.619 --> 44:19.006
- I can't--

44:19.006 --> 44:21.508
all right, go.
Come on. Go eat
somewhere else.

44:21.508 --> 44:24.011
Coming up next,
rain from canada.

44:24.011 --> 44:27.381
Hello. Yeah, counselor,
thanks for gettin' back
to me so quick.

44:29.383 --> 44:32.886
He says it's a broad
indictment that sounds better
for the feds than it really is.

44:33.387 --> 44:36.890
I wasn't named'cause the focus
of the investigation is some
telephone calling card scam...

44:36.890 --> 44:38.892
that junior and larry
had goin',

44:38.892 --> 44:43.397
and this diamante
technical stock thing
that i wasn't into.

44:43.530 --> 44:45.532
Thank god.

44:45.532 --> 44:48.535
That prick altieri
gave them reams of shit.

44:48.535 --> 44:51.038
They got stuff on me,
they got stuff on all of us...

44:51.038 --> 44:54.041
from the surveillance
at the green grove.

44:54.041 --> 44:58.045
They just don't have a case yet.
"An ongoing investigation,"
the d. A. Said.

44:58.045 --> 45:00.547
They always say that
to make it sound good.

45:02.049 --> 45:04.551
But this is
no fuckin' joke.

45:04.551 --> 45:06.553
What i gotta
worry about now...

45:06.553 --> 45:09.556
is the guys that got
pinched today, if they flip.

45:18.565 --> 45:20.567
All right. Good work.

45:25.072 --> 45:27.074
Art! Hello.
How are things?

45:27.074 --> 45:29.576
Good, father.
Busy!
Yeah!

45:29.576 --> 45:33.080
You?
Like the man said,
"rust never sleeps."

45:33.080 --> 45:36.583
Listen, father--

45:36.583 --> 45:39.586
i want to thank you
for taking the time out
to talk to me the other day.

45:39.586 --> 45:43.590
Ahh. Did you bring
your wife into things?
No.

45:43.590 --> 45:47.594
No?
Sitting there in the house
of god, i realized...

45:47.594 --> 45:50.597
you can either be
a "yes" person
or a "no" person.

45:50.597 --> 45:53.100
A positive ion
or a negative ion.

45:54.601 --> 45:57.604
I- i'm not quite sure
i get what you're saying.

45:57.604 --> 45:59.606
It's just that...

46:00.107 --> 46:03.610
this woman's always
been an odd bird,
a sea of negativity.

46:04.111 --> 46:07.114
Even as a kid, we all
learned to take her ravings
with a grain of salt.

46:07.114 --> 46:09.616
But you also said
the son was unstable.

46:14.621 --> 46:17.124
Complicated? Yes, he is.

46:17.124 --> 46:20.127
Little too comfortable
outside the law?
Yes, he is.

46:20.244 --> 46:25.249
But it would only add
to the quotient of sorrow
in the world to doubt him.

46:26.750 --> 46:28.752
When the source,
unfortunately, is a person...

46:28.752 --> 46:32.256
who rarely has
a kind word for anyone.

46:32.256 --> 46:35.259
Hmm.
You seem at peace.

46:35.259 --> 46:38.262
I am, father.

46:38.395 --> 46:40.898
Thank you again, father.
Sure.

46:40.898 --> 46:43.400
Okay, artie.

46:46.403 --> 46:48.405
Do you prefer
"corrado" or "junior"?

46:48.906 --> 46:52.359
I prefer "mr. Soprano."

46:52.359 --> 46:55.329
Your tenure as boss
was a short one.

46:55.329 --> 46:58.782
Actually, it was unusual
in several ways.

46:58.782 --> 47:01.251
Let me put this to you
as simply as i can.

47:01.251 --> 47:05.255
You can avoid sentencing
on these charges if
you will testify that, in fact,

47:05.255 --> 47:09.676
you were not
the boss of north jersey;
that, in fact,

47:09.676 --> 47:13.180
your nephew,
anthony soprano, wasandis.

47:13.180 --> 47:16.600
Thathe, de facto,
controlled your capos...

47:16.600 --> 47:18.602
with the backing of two
of the new york families,

47:19.102 --> 47:21.605
communicating through
their emissary, john sacrimoni.

47:25.058 --> 47:27.060
We want johnny sack.

47:27.060 --> 47:30.063
But more than him,
we want mangano and teresi.

47:30.063 --> 47:33.517
I wanna fuck angie dickinson.
See who gets lucky first.

47:33.517 --> 47:35.953
We want you
to corroborate information
that we obtained...

47:36.453 --> 47:37.955
through informants
and wire tap...

47:38.455 --> 47:40.457
that you were allowed
to profit, more or less,

47:40.958 --> 47:43.961
but you were not
making policy, and you were
not in the new york loop.

47:44.461 --> 47:47.464
You were positioned
to take the hits,
and now you've taken them.

47:47.464 --> 47:51.468
Question is, how long are
you gonna keep eating shit?

47:54.922 --> 47:59.426
You're 70 years old.
How many years you got left?

48:07.935 --> 48:11.438
My nephew running things?

48:11.438 --> 48:15.442
Not thatstrunz.
Not in this life.

48:22.082 --> 48:26.587
Hey! Here,
let me schlepp that.

48:27.838 --> 48:30.340
You got any more
in the car?
Mm- mm.

48:31.842 --> 48:33.844
How did you
get in here?
Liliana.

48:33.844 --> 48:36.346
She said to tell you
that she left early.

48:36.346 --> 48:40.350
So, what they're sayin'
on the tv about the storm
that's headed this way, huh?

48:40.350 --> 48:42.352
Yeah. You want
some coffee?

48:42.853 --> 48:44.354
Only if you're makin' it.

48:44.855 --> 48:46.356
Father, don't start that.

48:46.857 --> 48:51.361
No, really.
I mean, it's practically
the cocktail hour anyway.

48:51.862 --> 48:54.865
- Would you rather have
a glass of wine?
- How about a lillet?

48:54.865 --> 48:58.368
You in the mood?

48:58.368 --> 49:02.372
Just came to check on you guys,
see how you're holding up
with these indictments.

49:02.372 --> 49:04.875
We're hangin' in.
Oh.

49:06.376 --> 49:09.379
So, what we were
talking about,
a few months back--

49:09.379 --> 49:12.883
think any of these
recent developments have
brought tony any closer...

49:12.883 --> 49:15.385
to reexamining his life?

49:15.385 --> 49:19.389
Making some hard choices?
I told her she was
not to use my card again.

49:19.389 --> 49:21.391
No, that's mine.

49:21.391 --> 49:23.894
One true thing,
just out on dvd.

49:23.894 --> 49:26.396
I was over at video one
anyway, i thought maybe...

49:26.897 --> 49:30.017
you might want to take
your mind off these stressors.

49:33.020 --> 49:36.023
You want to stay
for dinner?

49:36.273 --> 49:40.527
- Something wrong, carm?
- Just tell me so i know
how many steaks to defrost.

49:40.527 --> 49:45.032
- Tony's not gonna make it.
- Well, if--

49:45.532 --> 49:48.035
you know, as i was saying,
my real concern for tony--

49:48.285 --> 49:51.788
father, he doesn't give
a flying fuck.

49:51.788 --> 49:55.292
You know it
and i know it-- at least
for the foreseeable future.

49:55.292 --> 49:57.794
Then that's even
a bigger reason to--
he's a sinner, father.

49:57.794 --> 50:00.797
And you come up here
and you eat his steaks,

50:00.797 --> 50:04.301
and you use his
home entertainment center--
carmela,

50:04.801 --> 50:09.056
the dvd is for you.
Really? Even after
just last week i told you...

50:09.556 --> 50:12.059
i'm not a big
renee zellwegger fan.
You did?

50:12.059 --> 50:16.697
I- i don't remember that.
You wanna watch
one true thing, fine.

50:16.697 --> 50:19.199
At least admit it.

50:19.199 --> 50:22.703
I d--
i thought you liked movies.
Mea culpa.

50:22.703 --> 50:27.207
Jesus, you know,
i get exactly the same
"who, me?" shit with tony.

50:27.207 --> 50:29.710
Two i don't need.

50:29.710 --> 50:33.714
"Has tony thought
about changing?"
Father, please.

50:33.714 --> 50:36.216
You do think i'm
a schnorrer, don't you?

50:36.216 --> 50:38.218
A- a- a parasite.

50:38.218 --> 50:41.221
I asked you that before
and you denied it, but clearly
that's what you think.

50:41.471 --> 50:43.974
No. You know
what i think, father?

50:43.974 --> 50:46.977
I think that you like the--
i don't even know
what to call it--

50:46.977 --> 50:52.482
the, uh,"whiff" of sexuality
that never goes anyplace.

50:52.599 --> 50:56.603
I had feelings for you,
carmela. I admitted it.

50:56.603 --> 50:58.605
It's my job to deal
with them so i can...

50:58.605 --> 51:00.607
carry on my pastoral duties.

51:01.108 --> 51:03.610
How does rosalie aprile
fit into your feelings for me?

51:04.111 --> 51:09.116
Oh, so that's it.

51:09.116 --> 51:13.120
I really appreciate
everything that you've done
for me, father phil, truly.

51:13.120 --> 51:18.008
The religious counselling,
the book on buddhism,

51:18.008 --> 51:21.011
the wonderful chats--
i am very fond of you.

51:21.511 --> 51:24.381
More than fond.

51:25.382 --> 51:28.268
But i think you need
to look at yourself.

51:30.637 --> 51:32.639
Call this an intervention.

51:33.140 --> 51:36.143
Because i think
you have this m. O.
Where you manipulate...

51:36.143 --> 51:38.645
spiritually
thirsty women,

51:38.645 --> 51:42.149
and i think a lot of it is
tied up with food, somehow,

51:42.149 --> 51:45.652
as well as
the sexual tension game.

51:47.654 --> 51:51.158
Whoa.

52:40.841 --> 52:44.845
Oh, mr. Soprano?
Your wife found you. Good.

52:44.845 --> 52:46.847
Found me?
What are you talking about?

52:46.847 --> 52:50.851
You haven't spoken?
We left a message
on your home machine.

52:50.851 --> 52:53.353
Your mom's had a stroke.

52:53.353 --> 52:56.857
Stroke?
The news on tv yesterday,
it really upset her.

52:56.857 --> 52:59.359
Not that it's
any of my business.
Anyhow, it just happened.

52:59.860 --> 53:02.863
The e. M. T. 's are
stabilizing her for the ride
to st. Vincent's.

53:04.865 --> 53:07.367
Ma.

53:07.367 --> 53:09.369
I know what you did.
Sir, please--

53:09.369 --> 53:13.623
your only son.
Your middle child.

53:13.740 --> 53:16.877
- She can't answer you. Her
speech center's been affected.
- Yeah, my ass.

53:16.877 --> 53:20.881
Heard the tapes, ma.
The fuckin' f. B. I. Tapes.
Don't tell me you don't know--

53:21.131 --> 53:23.633
hey!
George clooney, don't get in
the fuckin' middle of this.

53:23.633 --> 53:25.635
Mr. Soprano--
alonzo, call security.

53:26.136 --> 53:30.640
Uncle jun's in jail now.
And i got one last detail
i gotta take care of.

53:30.757 --> 53:33.760
Mr. Soprano!
I didn't tell you, i don't
die that fuckin' easy, ma.

53:33.894 --> 53:36.396
I'm gonna live a long,
happy life, which is more
than i can say for you.

53:36.897 --> 53:37.898
That's enough!
Yeah?

53:37.898 --> 53:40.150
Keep her moving. Keep moving.

53:40.150 --> 53:43.653
- I try to do right by you.
You try to get me whacked?
- She doesn't understand you.

53:43.653 --> 53:45.655
She smiled!
Look at the look on her face!

53:46.156 --> 53:48.158
Go look at the look
on her face. She's smiling.

53:48.275 --> 53:50.277
Get off me. Off me.

53:50.277 --> 53:53.280
Look at her face!
She's got a fuckin' smile
on her face!

53:53.280 --> 53:55.282
All right, that's enough.

54:27.897 --> 54:29.899
She go vacation!

54:54.424 --> 54:57.427
Dad, give it up. We're not
gonna make it to aunt patty's.

55:01.931 --> 55:04.434
Dad, hello. We're not gonna
make it to aunt patty's.

55:04.434 --> 55:06.936
Why did i buy a goddamn
off- road vehicle?

55:07.070 --> 55:10.323
To waste petrochemical
resources?

55:10.323 --> 55:13.827
She's right. We can't
keep drivin' in this. I can
hardly see in front of us here.

55:14.077 --> 55:17.580
What street are we on?
I think it's
walnut parkway.

55:17.580 --> 55:19.699
I got an idea.

55:27.707 --> 55:30.210
Come on, come on.
Inside.

55:30.210 --> 55:32.712
It better be open.
Forget the umbrella.
Come on.

55:41.721 --> 55:43.356
Artie, thank christ.

55:43.356 --> 55:45.859
We went to pick up
the kids at school because
of the buses and all.

55:45.859 --> 55:48.478
We can't get to the house.
There's a huge tree
across mountain avenue.

55:48.728 --> 55:51.481
Oh, marrone.
We been driving around
since 7:00.

55:51.481 --> 55:54.484
Nobody's eaten nothing.
Ton, i got no power,
no lights--

55:54.484 --> 55:56.986
i'm closing as soon as
these last few people leave.

55:56.986 --> 55:59.989
Let's go to mickey d. 's,
they'll be open.
All right, let's go.

56:02.876 --> 56:06.880
Let's go.
No! Come on!
What do you-- come on!

56:06.996 --> 56:08.998
We'll figure out something.
Come on.

56:10.750 --> 56:13.253
They gave me steroids, too,
but it fucked me up.

56:13.753 --> 56:16.756
Yeah, well, keep away
from me when i ski,
all right?

56:16.756 --> 56:20.760
Hey, look at this.
Hey, what are you doing, ton?

56:20.760 --> 56:23.763
Hey, squirt.
How are you doin', pal?

56:23.763 --> 56:26.266
Adriana, you look beautiful.
How are you doin'?

56:30.270 --> 56:32.772
- How are you? -

56:32.772 --> 56:37.777
chiara, her brother and sister,
are back in the kitchen
if you want to say hello.

56:38.278 --> 56:41.281
More refugees.
The gas is still workin'.

56:41.781 --> 56:45.285
I been cookin' by candlelight.
I can make anything
on the menu except--

56:45.285 --> 56:50.173
- whatever you got is fine.
- Jose! Cabernet, por favor.

56:50.173 --> 56:53.042
- Regaleali, right?
- Yeah. Beautiful.

56:54.544 --> 56:56.546
No cigars, please.

57:04.053 --> 57:07.557
Look at that fuckin'
lovesick pygmy over there.

57:09.559 --> 57:12.061
The skip seein'
a psychiatrist--

57:12.061 --> 57:14.564
how's that sit
with your ass?

57:14.564 --> 57:16.566
I usually do
sit with my ass.

57:16.566 --> 57:18.568
Why don't you sit
with yours?
Hey!

57:18.568 --> 57:21.571
Pat cooper over here.

57:21.571 --> 57:23.573
Wait a minute.
This bothers you?

57:24.073 --> 57:25.575
Yousawa fuckin'
psychiatrist.

57:26.075 --> 57:29.078
Not a woman.
I can't get past that.

57:29.078 --> 57:32.582
It don't compute for me.
You're the one with
the fuckin' issues.

57:32.582 --> 57:35.084
Womanissues.
Ah, i don't even wanna
fuckin' go there.

57:35.585 --> 57:37.587
Well, let's not.

57:37.587 --> 57:40.590
Irregardless,
i said my piece.

57:40.590 --> 57:42.592
What are you
gettin' at, paulie?

57:43.092 --> 57:46.095
Nothin'.

57:46.095 --> 57:49.599
Look, he's gonna be
their new boss now.

57:49.599 --> 57:53.603
In name, in everything.
Wish himbuona fortuna.

57:57.991 --> 57:59.993
You guys have any
peanut butter back here?

57:59.993 --> 58:02.996
You gotta be kidding.

58:13.006 --> 58:16.626
Oh, god, artie, you saved
our friggin' lives here.

58:17.877 --> 58:20.380
It's beautiful, artie.
Thank you.

58:20.513 --> 58:22.015
Enjoy.

58:24.017 --> 58:26.519
- Ah, fuck!
- Hey!

58:26.519 --> 58:28.638
You said "frig."

58:31.140 --> 58:34.143
All right,
wait a minute.

58:34.143 --> 58:36.396
I'd like to propose a toast.

58:38.281 --> 58:40.400
To my family.

58:42.902 --> 58:46.906
Someday soon, you're gonna
have families of your own.

58:47.407 --> 58:49.909
And if you're lucky,

58:49.909 --> 58:52.912
you'll remember
the little moments.

58:52.912 --> 58:55.415
Like this.

58:58.918 --> 59:01.921
That were good.

59:03.423 --> 59:05.808
Cheers.
