decision as always.

03:56.037 --> 03:58.372
I just agreed immediately.

It was a one-way street
leading nowhere, Dad.

MAN: Congratulations, Buford.
Keep up the good work.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.064
BUFORD: Thank you.
Hey, Buford!

41:22.065 --> 41:25.066
Congratulations.
Buford. Hey!

41:25.067 --> 41:27.569
Man, you really know
how to play the crowd.

41:29.121 --> 41:31.122
You had that
jury ready to walk

41:31.123 --> 41:33.125
barefoot over
hot coals for you.

41:35.544 --> 41:38.046
That's something
they'd never do for him.

41:39.047 --> 41:40.548
Hey, Buford.

41:40.549 --> 41:43.552
Buford, why don't you try
this job on for size?

41:50.058 --> 41:51.560
No, Buford, no!

41:53.061 --> 41:54.562
We'll go someplace else.

41:54.563 --> 41:56.564
Find a decent
town to live in.

41:56.565 --> 41:57.849
Where?

41:58.350 --> 41:59.350
And how?

41:59.351 --> 42:01.353
Everything we've got's
sunk in this place.

42:03.355 --> 42:04.739
Besides, I never turned tail
and run from nobody.

42:04.740 --> 42:05.856
I'm not gonna start
with these people.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.859
Is your pride worth the safety
of those children?

42:08.860 --> 42:10.611
Of all of us?

42:10.612 --> 42:11.612
Okay, then you leave.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.114
You go to your mama's
and you take the kids

42:13.115 --> 42:14.415
and you come
back when it's okay.

42:14.416 --> 42:16.917
I don't want to leave you.

42:16.918 --> 42:19.921
And I don't want you
to run for sheriff.

42:21.423 --> 42:23.424
"No more fighting,
" you said.

42:23.425 --> 42:24.926
You gave your word.

42:25.427 --> 42:26.927
Wild Bull Buford's word.

42:26.928 --> 42:28.129
On that you can bank.

42:28.130 --> 42:29.930
I didn't know this
was gonna happen.

42:29.931 --> 42:31.932
Oh, well, you're turning this

42:31.933 --> 42:35.052
into some kind of senseless
life and death grudge fight.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.554
It's not senseless, Pauline.

42:36.555 --> 42:38.056
Listen to me.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.058
Pauline,

42:41.059 --> 42:42.444
this is my home.

42:43.445 --> 42:44.945
You made it yours.

42:44.946 --> 42:47.448
And you want me and you and the
kids just to go run, hide,

42:47.449 --> 42:48.950
afraid to come home?

42:50.452 --> 42:51.953
Just for a little while.

42:52.454 --> 42:54.322
Only until all this
violence blows over.

42:54.823 --> 42:56.323
It's not gonna
blow over by itself.

42:56.324 --> 42:57.826
Now somebody's got
to huff and puff.

42:58.326 --> 42:59.828

my chances are?

43:10.722 --> 43:12.224
Fair. Fair.

43:12.724 --> 43:15.226
I'll tell you something,
though, Buford.

43:15.227 --> 43:17.728
You run against
these people and lose,

43:17.729 --> 43:20.231
you're gonna be
worse off than before.

43:20.232 --> 43:21.732
'Cause you'll
never find anyone

43:21.733 --> 43:23.602
to stand up against
them for you again.

plush job as my deputy?

just brute animal force.

45:37.953 --> 45:40.071
I ain't that desperate.

You sure as hell will be.

that's what I call

46:13.605 --> 46:16.106
a pure case of
reckless driving.

you're gonna vote for him!

dock you a day's pay!

than you can make

50:09.507 --> 50:11.559
in 20 years as a deputy.

50:12.560 --> 50:14.561
And all you gotta
do is testify that

50:14.562 --> 50:17.598
Buford deliberately
ran you off the road.

50:17.599 --> 50:20.101
That's murder
and the end of him.

50:23.605 --> 50:25.406

Well, looks like our only
chance now is to elect a corpse

51:06.147 --> 51:09.651
and gamble on getting our own man
appointed in his place.

week before election.

out of town?

for you, huh?

If you live long enough,

59:27.815 --> 59:31.569
you're gonna wish this day
never happened, smart ass!

59:33.571 --> 59:36.574
Sit down, smart ass!

59:37.074 --> 59:38.074
Sit down!

01:00:01.982 --> 01:00:05.686
Sheriff Pusser, the court orders
you to set the prisoners free.

01:00:07.188 --> 01:00:08.188
You don't mean that, Judge.

01:00:08.189 --> 01:00:10.191
I do and I'm so ordering you.

01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:12.358
Why?

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:13.661
Because you acted improperly.

01:00:14.028 --> 01:00:15.788
You failed to get
search and seizure warrants

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:18.164
before you invaded
their privacy.

01:00:18.165 --> 01:00:20.166
You failed to inform them
at the time of their arrest,

01:00:20.167 --> 01:00:22.452
of their legal
rights to counsel,

01:00:22.453 --> 01:00:25.371
to silence,
to access to a telephone.

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:28.374
These people were responsible
for eight deaths, Judge.

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:31.428
You can't just let them go because
of some little technicalities.

01:00:31.429 --> 01:00:34.431
The United States Supreme Court
does not consider them

01:00:34.432 --> 01:00:36.434
little technicalities,
Sheriff Pusser.

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:39.219
They are the law of the land.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.721
There's more to upholding the law
than swinging a big stick

01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:43.274
and kicking down doors.

01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:46.776
Now you set them free,
or I'll hold you in contempt,

01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:48.028
which I do anyway.

01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:55.653
Remove those handcuffs.

01:01:15.973 --> 01:01:18.892
Buford, there's a man,

01:01:18.893 --> 01:01:21.394
Mr. Witter from Nashville
was here looking for you.

01:01:21.395 --> 01:01:24.398
He's up there now,
talking to Judge Clarke.

01:01:28.068 --> 01:01:29.068
Mr. Witter.

01:01:34.158 --> 01:01:36.159
Sheriff, this is John Witter.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.078
Very pleased to make
your acquaintance, Sheriff.

01:01:39.079 --> 01:01:41.532
Judge Clarke's been
telling me all about you.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.667
Well, that shouldn't
have taken him long.

01:01:44.168 --> 01:01:46.954
I wonder if I can
talk to you in private?

01:01:51.759 --> 01:01:53.260
I think it'd be
better in your office.

01:01:53.761 --> 01:01:55.262
Oh, well, this is it.

01:02:24.064 --> 01:02:26.066
Pusser,
you're a local sheriff.

01:02:27.067 --> 01:02:29.069
A brand new one at that.

01:02:31.071 --> 01:02:33.072
Now, maybe nobody
told you,

01:02:33.073 --> 01:02:37.661
but this is a lot more than
just a local operation.

01:02:38.161 --> 01:02:40.663
I mean, there are some important
people involved,

01:02:40.664 --> 01:02:44.667
all the way up to the capital
and beyond, believe me.

01:02:44.668 --> 01:02:48.170
Well, the only important people
to me are down there.

01:02:48.171 --> 01:02:51.008
They built the county.
They have to live in it.

01:02:52.509 --> 01:02:53.509
You know,
one of the first things

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:55.011
you gotta learn
to do in this life

01:02:55.012 --> 01:02:56.896
is to take care of number one.

01:02:56.897 --> 01:02:59.398
If you don't,
nobody else will.

01:02:59.399 --> 01:03:01.318
You don't have to
commit any sins.

01:03:01.818 --> 01:03:02.818
All you've gotta
do is let those

01:03:02.819 --> 01:03:05.571
who want to pay
for their fun, do it.

01:03:05.572 --> 01:03:08.575
I got nothing against
a little drink, a little fun,

01:03:09.076 --> 01:03:12.078
but the law of the land
shouldn't be for sale.

01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:14.580
Now if you let those people
that run those joints have an inch,

01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:15.915
they'll steal
the whole state.

01:03:15.916 --> 01:03:18.418
And it looks like they've already
got a leg up on it.

01:03:20.287 --> 01:03:23.290
Well, I suggest you think it over
for a day or two.

01:03:24.791 --> 01:03:27.294
Why don't you come
on up to Nashville

01:03:27.794 --> 01:03:28.794
and you meet
some of the fellas.

01:03:28.795 --> 01:03:30.796
You'll like them.

01:03:30.797 --> 01:03:33.549
You'll find
them very generous.

01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:35.051
Well, I already
thought it over,

01:03:35.052 --> 01:03:36.852
long before I went after
this job, Mr. Witter.

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.221
So I heard.

01:03:39.723 --> 01:03:44.611
You know, ideals and realities
are very far apart.

01:03:47.064 --> 01:03:49.532
One day you're
gonna see that, son.

01:03:49.533 --> 01:03:53.537
And if you don't,
someone's gonna point it out to you.

01:03:54.037 --> 01:03:55.037
Clearly.

01:03:55.822 --> 01:03:58.291
You already have.
Thank you.

01:04:03.463 --> 01:04:06.466
Enjoy yourselves, boys,
these are two of the best.

01:04:12.973 --> 01:04:14.975
Here comes that big stick.

01:04:19.429 --> 01:04:21.932
Hi, Luan,
I see you moved your trailer.

01:04:24.935 --> 01:04:27.437
And I see
you're still looking.

01:04:34.411 --> 01:04:38.414
Hi, Callie.
Hello, Prentiss.

01:04:38.415 --> 01:04:39.782
You know, Callie,

01:04:39.783 --> 01:04:42.786
you've got one of the sexiest
track teams I've ever seen.

01:04:43.286 --> 01:04:46.289
What's the record between
here and the trailer, huh?

01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:48.291
Hmm?

01:04:57.801 --> 01:05:01.303
Hey, Callie,
wanna open the storeroom?

01:05:01.304 --> 01:05:03.306
The one with
the illegal liquor?

01:05:05.308 --> 01:05:08.728
Prentiss, open the storeroom
for the sheriff.

01:05:08.729 --> 01:05:10.813
Leave those there.

01:05:10.814 --> 01:05:12.232
Put those
against the back wall.

01:05:15.318 --> 01:05:16.819
All right,
if he won't buy off,

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.320
let's kill
the son of a bitch.

01:05:18.321 --> 01:05:20.991
You know what Witter said.
"Go easy."

01:05:21.491 --> 01:05:23.731
The Nashville papers are
playing up that big stick of his

01:05:23.994 --> 01:05:26.128
like he was Sir
Lancelot or somebody.

01:05:26.129 --> 01:05:30.000
We ought to take Sir Lancelot's
big stick and shove it up his ass!

01:05:32.002 --> 01:05:34.003
We ought to do
what we're told to do.

01:05:34.004 --> 01:05:37.506
Find some way to
teach him a lesson.

01:05:37.507 --> 01:05:40.643
Then maybe Witter can talk
some sense into him.

01:05:40.644 --> 01:05:43.146
You teach him
your kind of lesson.

01:05:43.647 --> 01:05:45.648
I got a couple boys in Alabama
who'll teach him something

01:05:45.649 --> 01:05:47.267
he won't live to remember.

parked outside,

hello to our new deputy.

the hell out of the way

01:07:38.128 --> 01:07:40.630

some drinking, huh?

I was talking to you, boy.

at Willie Rae's,

troublemakers down here.

and pick them up?

that's important.

of the thing.

this whole thing over.

a fool out of myself.

01:13:32.031 --> 01:13:33.949
that the sheriff has
the right to assign

01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:35.868
courtrooms and
judges' chambers.

01:13:36.369 --> 01:13:37.569
In view of your
past judgments,

01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:39.705
I thought you'd feel
more at home here.

01:13:39.706 --> 01:13:41.874
You have your own
choice of seats.

01:13:44.544 --> 01:13:46.045
Of course,
there's no telephone yet,

01:13:46.546 --> 01:13:48.548
but you won't
need one today.

01:13:49.048 --> 01:13:51.049
Here's a list
of search and seizure warrants

01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:53.552
that I want by 3:00 today.

01:13:53.553 --> 01:13:55.837
I'll have your lunch sent in.

01:13:55.838 --> 01:13:58.340
Oh, and by the way,
if any word of these warrants,

01:13:58.341 --> 01:14:00.342
excuse the expression,
leaks out,

01:14:00.343 --> 01:14:02.729
well, your distinguished
career is over.

I'll be damned!

01:14:22.081 --> 01:14:24.082
Okay,
the preliminaries are over.

01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:25.963
We now all know each other,
we know the problem.

01:14:27.253 --> 01:14:28.613
I was elected
sheriff on one issue,

01:14:28.755 --> 01:14:30.255
that I bust every joint
in the whole county.

01:14:30.256 --> 01:14:32.958
And we're gonna
start tomorrow.

01:14:32.959 --> 01:14:35.961
First off,
I don't want any car, truck,

01:14:35.962 --> 01:14:37.462
or driver that
even looks like

01:14:37.463 --> 01:14:38.848
a moonshiner to
move on our roads.

01:14:39.349 --> 01:14:42.100
Lonnie, you and Chris,
you handle Highways 45 and 64.

01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:45.103
Okay, and I hear
there's four new stills operating.

01:14:45.104 --> 01:14:48.607
Two of them up
near Big Mill Road, one in Donald Springs,

01:14:48.608 --> 01:14:51.109
and one back up
in Pepper Hill.

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:52.444
Grady, that's your job.

01:14:52.445 --> 01:14:53.946
Knock them all flat.

01:14:54.447 --> 01:14:55.947
Alone?

01:14:55.948 --> 01:14:57.949
Well, now if you was to look
over your shoulders,

01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:59.952
it's just likely
you might see me

01:15:00.453 --> 01:15:02.789
and four or
five other loggers a-standing there.

01:15:04.707 --> 01:15:07.210
Okay, the rest of us wait until
the illegal liquor's flowing.

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:08.710
The girls are making
their trailer runs,

01:15:08.711 --> 01:15:11.213
and the suckers are
crowding the tables.

01:15:11.214 --> 01:15:13.498
And then we hit
fast and hard.

01:15:13.499 --> 01:15:17.169
Obra, you're in charge
of the east half.

01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:19.672
Virgil, I want you to make
the west half run.

01:15:20.173 --> 01:15:21.673
Big job.

01:15:21.674 --> 01:15:23.343
Well, you're a big man.

01:15:23.843 --> 01:15:25.345
This whole thing rests
on one element.

how much he hates them,

like he's earned the right.

one on unless you say,

out of my sight.

you'll never make it.

01:24:53.545 --> 01:24:55.246
Don't do it!

BUFORD: All right, tell them, Virgil.

01:24:56.749 --> 01:24:58.249
No.

01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:59.752
Tell everybody
who tipped them off!

01:25:00.753 --> 01:25:02.086
Tell them, Virgil!

01:25:02.087 --> 01:25:04.088
Tell them how they knew
I took the back way home at night.

01:25:11.013 --> 01:25:12.598

your knees, Virgil.

Okay, Virgil, crawl to me!

01:25:28.697 --> 01:25:30.698
Crawl over here! Faster!

Ellie Mae,
this is the sheriff.

01:44:30.555 --> 01:44:34.058
You have any idea where that call
came from just now?

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.845
How many parties
on that line?

01:44:39.847 --> 01:44:41.349
Thank you.

01:44:46.571 --> 01:44:47.989
Who was that?

01:44:51.993 --> 01:44:55.996
Oh. A party line
down at Donald Springs.

01:44:55.997 --> 01:45:00.000
Some neighbor overheard of a plan
to set up a new still.

01:45:00.001 --> 01:45:03.620
I gotta go down and read
the riot act to them.

01:45:03.621 --> 01:45:05.623
It's gonna be a lot of work
tearing it down.

01:45:06.124 --> 01:45:07.125
You go back to sleep.

01:45:14.132 --> 01:45:15.632

my husband earns his living.

I'm hurrying!

01:45:39.323 --> 01:45:41.826
You're like a breath of spring.

01:45:56.757 --> 01:45:58.258
It's probably
just a false alarm.

We'll probably
end up just taking

01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:01.761

on the way back.
