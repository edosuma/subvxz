03:14.514 --> 03:16.584
Let's go down.

03:27.154 --> 03:31.067
- You got some out. How many left?
- Three out, eight left.

03:31.154 --> 03:34.430
- Edgar's still the man?
- Edgar's the man.

03:34.514 --> 03:37.392
Edgar, l want to thank you
for letting these people go.

03:37.434 --> 03:41.222
Send out the others, and we can come
to a peaceful resolution.

03:41.274 --> 03:45.062
Get this straight. l don't trust you or
any agent of your occupation government.

03:45.114 --> 03:46.991
Listen to me
one more time.

03:47.034 --> 03:50.231
l have an order from the Citizens' Court
of South Dakota...

03:50.314 --> 03:52.782
to seize the ill-gotten assets
of this bank.

03:52.874 --> 03:56.583
Move your people away from here or
these bloodsuckers will burn in hell!

04:04.154 --> 04:06.031
They're gettin' ready
to come in.

04:06.114 --> 04:08.503
Let them come.

04:08.594 --> 04:10.983
- l have to go home.
- Get down!

04:11.074 --> 04:13.269
Please, let me go home.
Please, let me go home.

04:13.354 --> 04:16.426
- Get the fuck down!
- l just need to go home.

04:16.514 --> 04:19.074
When he says ''get down,''
just do it!

04:28.714 --> 04:30.784
Damn!

04:37.474 --> 04:40.705
l sure don't feel good.

04:40.754 --> 04:44.144
You said we were gonna be in and out of
here before anybody knew what hit 'em.

04:44.234 --> 04:47.306
You said they were
gonna back down.

04:47.354 --> 04:50.346
They ain't backin' down, Edgar.

04:50.394 --> 04:52.783
They got an army
out there.

04:52.874 --> 04:54.910
They're gonna come in here
and shoot all of us.

04:54.994 --> 04:57.064
God just wants His miracle
to be greater.

04:57.114 --> 05:00.504
God doesn't want your boys
to get killed, Edgar!

05:09.234 --> 05:11.907
We need more time,
you sons of bitches!

05:11.954 --> 05:14.024
You ain't in charge here.
So shut up!

05:14.074 --> 05:15.985
- They cut us off.
- We gotta go in.

05:16.074 --> 05:19.623
- We have a man in there.
He wants more time.
- Right.

05:19.714 --> 05:23.468
Undercover agent who isn't supposed
to be there in the first place.

05:23.554 --> 05:26.114
- We're goin' in.
- Let me try 'em on the bullhorn.

05:26.194 --> 05:28.105
- lf they come back to me--
- You've got three minutes.

05:31.554 --> 05:33.385
This is Agent Blackwell,
Edgar.

05:33.474 --> 05:38.673
l need you to pick up
the telephone.

05:38.754 --> 05:42.827
- l need to talk with you.
- We can still walk out of here.

05:42.874 --> 05:45.342
You just gotta
stand up to him.

05:47.594 --> 05:51.712
Just tell him you wanna go home.
Can you do it?

05:51.794 --> 05:56.151
Edgar, please pick up
the phone. We can still work this out.

06:02.754 --> 06:06.269
Edgar, please pick up
the phone. We were doing well before.

06:06.354 --> 06:08.185
Sir?

06:08.274 --> 06:10.390
Peter's right.

06:10.474 --> 06:14.228
lt's not like you said
it was going to be.

06:16.594 --> 06:18.425
l wanna go home.

06:31.634 --> 06:35.388
Edgar,
the boy's right.

06:35.474 --> 06:37.385
- Traitor.
- Daddy.
- Shut up, lsaac.

06:37.434 --> 06:39.948
- Let me call 'em on the telephone.
- We don't need him.

06:40.034 --> 06:42.502
- We can still walk out of here.
- Do it, Edgar!

06:42.554 --> 06:45.148
For your boys, do it!

06:56.154 --> 06:58.190
Get down! Get down!

07:01.394 --> 07:03.544
F.B.l.!
Get on the ground.

07:12.674 --> 07:14.904
Go, go, go!

07:14.994 --> 07:16.825
Daddy!

07:18.354 --> 07:20.106
Stay down!
Don't move.

07:20.194 --> 07:24.506
- Don't move, goddamn it!
- l'm F.B.l. F.B.l.!
Get off me, asshole!

07:24.594 --> 07:27.427
- Tell your men to hold their fire.
- Peter.

07:27.474 --> 07:29.783
- Peter.
- James?

07:29.874 --> 07:32.752
James, keep your head down!
Where are you?

07:32.794 --> 07:35.627
- Peter!
- No! No! No!

07:35.674 --> 07:39.030
Hold your fire!
No! No!

07:40.314 --> 07:41.952
Damn it!

07:44.634 --> 07:47.467
Goddamn it!

07:47.514 --> 07:49.391
Shoot! Shoot!

07:49.434 --> 07:54.747
Get a med tech in here!
Get a med tech in here, goddamn it!

07:54.834 --> 07:57.029
Don't talk.
Don't talk.

07:57.074 --> 07:59.463
Come on now, goddamn it!

07:59.554 --> 08:01.909
Get a med tech in here!

08:06.074 --> 08:07.632
He's dead.

08:15.514 --> 08:17.391
Who said ''go''?

08:19.354 --> 08:21.072
Who's the S.A.C.?

08:21.154 --> 08:23.952
Hartley.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.351
Hartley!

08:30.674 --> 08:33.631
Special Agent Hartley!

08:33.714 --> 08:36.592
Hartley! Did you hear me ask
for more time?

08:36.634 --> 08:39.831
- Get your hands off me.
- Did you hear me ask for more time?

08:39.914 --> 08:42.746
- You're out of line, Jeffries.
- l'm out of line? l'm out of line?

08:42.833 --> 08:47.703
Did l just massacre
five fuckin' people? Huh? Did l?

08:47.794 --> 08:52.470
Three seconds, Hartley,
l was gonna walk 'em all out alive.

08:52.554 --> 08:54.272
Massacre.

08:54.354 --> 08:56.822
They were just kids.

08:58.994 --> 09:00.871
Just kids.

09:02.114 --> 09:05.789
l report to Washington
just like you do, Jeffries.

09:57.434 --> 10:01.393
Right on Western.
Left on Belmont.

10:01.474 --> 10:04.272
- Hey, Simon, l have a surprise for you.
- Right on Halsted.

10:04.354 --> 10:08.427
- Left on Fullerton.
- You're giving some good directions.

10:08.514 --> 10:12.109
Look. l have something
very, very special.

10:12.194 --> 10:15.106
You like these puzzles,
don't ya?

10:15.154 --> 10:18.305
Uh-huh. Okay,
but not yet, Simon.

10:18.354 --> 10:22.666
lf l give you the puzzle book,
l want you to join in with
the rest of the class, okay?

10:31.314 --> 10:33.191
That's great.

10:33.234 --> 10:35.987
lt's time to join
the group now, okay?

10:41.194 --> 10:43.025
Good morning, Simon.

10:43.114 --> 10:44.991
Good morning, teacher.

10:45.074 --> 10:47.634
Look at me.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.788
Good morning, teacher.

11:09.194 --> 11:12.345
l better not beat you.
l only accept cash.

11:21.114 --> 11:24.743
- How are you?
- Well, another day at the office.

11:24.794 --> 11:27.433
- You ready?
- Yeah.

11:27.474 --> 11:30.227
All right,
let's talk about it.

11:31.474 --> 11:33.988
Agent Jeffries here
to see you, Chief.

11:42.874 --> 11:46.662
The psychologist wrote
''delusional paranoia''...

11:46.754 --> 11:49.712
in capital letters
across the bottom of your file.

11:49.754 --> 11:53.872
- So, am l fired?
- No, you're not fired.

11:56.354 --> 12:00.063
- But l can't put you undercover
anymore. That's over.
- What do they expect me to do?

12:00.114 --> 12:03.504
- To do your job.
- l work undercover. That's my job.

12:03.594 --> 12:06.506
- You have a new job now.
- And what is that?

12:06.554 --> 12:09.864
Sitting on a wire,
stakeouts, log tapes.

12:09.914 --> 12:12.382
- A little public relations.
- Fourteen years on the job,
and that's all it means?

12:12.434 --> 12:15.426
l've gotta sit
on a wire with some rookie listening
to a housewife order groceries?

12:15.474 --> 12:18.193
- All you had to do
was keep your mouth shut.
- All l did was tell the truth.

12:18.274 --> 12:21.232
- Act like you belong on the
same team as the rest of us.
- What team?

12:21.314 --> 12:24.112
That bunch of suits sitting behind a
desk trying to justify their existence?

12:24.154 --> 12:27.305
- Like me. ls that what you're saying?
- l don't know, Joe.

12:27.354 --> 12:30.232
- Why didn't you say one thing
to back me up?
- Because you were wrong!

12:30.314 --> 12:32.623
- l wasn't wrong!
- You were dead wrong.

12:32.714 --> 12:35.706
Two teenage kids in cold blood,
and you know it.

12:35.794 --> 12:39.070
- They were goddamn bank robbers,
for Christ's sake!
- They were kids.

12:39.154 --> 12:41.907
Will you forget
about South Dakota?

12:41.994 --> 12:45.066
Forget who's right and who's wrong.
This is one of the best undercover guys.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.589
How could l forget that?

12:52.914 --> 12:54.825
Sit down, Art.

13:03.274 --> 13:06.346
Sometimes...
you got somethin'.

13:07.474 --> 13:10.432
lt's... magic.

13:12.274 --> 13:14.185
Then it goes away.

13:14.234 --> 13:16.111
You had it.

13:17.314 --> 13:19.464
But the magic's gone.

13:21.234 --> 13:25.386
They told you to break my balls,
and see if you could get me to quit.

13:25.434 --> 13:27.504
l'm not gonna make it easy
for you.

13:27.594 --> 13:31.109
You want me to sit on a wire,
l'll do it.

13:31.154 --> 13:34.669
You want me to chase
file applicants, l'll do that.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.591
Take your best shot.

13:36.634 --> 13:39.307
Check your mailbox
for your new assignments.

14:00.234 --> 14:02.668
Hey, Simon, we're here.

14:28.474 --> 14:30.704
Mommy, Simon is home.

14:30.794 --> 14:33.388
Look at me.

14:33.474 --> 14:35.305
Hi, Mom.

14:35.354 --> 14:38.426
Hi, honey. l missed you.
Come on inside.

15:19.834 --> 15:22.394
Be careful.

15:22.474 --> 15:24.271
lt's very hot.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.464
Sip it slowly.

15:28.394 --> 15:30.385
Daddy'll be home soon.

15:30.474 --> 15:34.069
And when you finish that,
you can wait for him up in your room.

17:18.034 --> 17:20.673
Congratulations.
You've reached the Puzzle Center.

17:20.753 --> 17:22.585
For solving one
of our master puzzles...

17:22.674 --> 17:25.472
you've won a subscription
to the magazine of your choice.

17:25.554 --> 17:27.464
Can l please have your name,
address and telephone number?

17:27.554 --> 17:29.624
You are...

17:29.714 --> 17:31.670
a stranger.

17:31.754 --> 17:36.908
Excuse me. This the Puzzle Center.
Where did you get this number?

17:36.994 --> 17:40.873
Puzzle nine-nine.

17:40.914 --> 17:43.144
What did you just say?
Who is this?

17:43.234 --> 17:45.065
Simon,
put down the phone.

17:45.114 --> 17:47.469
Simon, Simon, wait a second.
Please don't hang--

17:55.794 --> 17:58.149
Come on, come on.

17:59.754 --> 18:01.153
Figures.

18:01.234 --> 18:03.065
See if they correlate.

18:03.154 --> 18:06.544
lf they don't, you may have lost some
bytes in the transfer, lost a keyword.

18:06.634 --> 18:09.751
You won't be able
to defractionate. Yeah?

18:09.834 --> 18:11.950
- Are you scrambled?
- Give me a break, Leo. l'm busy.

18:11.994 --> 18:15.066
lt's Mercury, Dean. Somebody just walked
on water. You have to get up here now.

18:20.914 --> 18:26.386
- What did you just say?
- You are a stranger.

18:26.474 --> 18:29.671
- Who is this?
- Simon, put down the phone.

18:29.714 --> 18:32.990
Simon, Simon, wait a second.
Please don't hang--

18:34.034 --> 18:35.911
Who is that?

18:37.434 --> 18:39.629
Listen to the timbre
of his voice.

18:39.714 --> 18:43.263
lt's a child.
That had to be his mother.

18:43.314 --> 18:45.225
Right. lt's just
some rug rat...

18:45.274 --> 18:48.346
drooling over the phone,
punching numbers, like a random thing.

18:48.434 --> 18:50.265
Huh?

18:51.314 --> 18:53.350
We're not that lucky.

18:56.354 --> 18:58.868
- We have to call Kudrow.
- What? Dean, what?

18:58.954 --> 19:01.184
No, no, no.
We don't have to call anybody.

19:01.234 --> 19:04.829
All we gotta do is an analysis,
and give him a report when he gets back.

19:04.914 --> 19:08.111
- That's it!
- Do you understand what just happened?

19:08.194 --> 19:11.789
We have to call him now
or he's gonna say we tried to hide it.

19:20.874 --> 19:23.627
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning, Marine.

19:23.714 --> 19:27.150
l've got an urgent message
for Lieutenant Colonel Kudrow.

19:27.194 --> 19:30.630
Mercury is already
operational in most of our com centers.

19:30.674 --> 19:33.632
And l'm here to confirm
everything you've already heard.

19:33.714 --> 19:37.548
Mercury is a quantum leap
in our communications security.

19:37.634 --> 19:40.626
And once we complete its installation
in all of our com centers...

19:40.714 --> 19:43.786
- it's going to be very hard
for our adversaries--
- And our allies.

19:43.834 --> 19:48.510
And our allies to compromise
our communications.

19:48.594 --> 19:51.062
An urgent message
for you, sir.

19:56.714 --> 19:58.545
lf you'll excuse me.

19:58.634 --> 20:02.752
-Mr. Johnson will continue the briefing.
-All right, gentlemen.

20:18.034 --> 20:19.865
lmpossible.

21:04.794 --> 21:08.503
- You're late.
- l wasn't when l started.

21:09.754 --> 21:11.949
Traffic was like mud.

21:11.994 --> 21:13.871
l oozed home.

21:17.394 --> 21:20.591
l told Simon
he could wait up for you.

21:20.634 --> 21:22.590
Simon, my man.

21:28.154 --> 21:31.669
l wonder where Simon is.

21:36.674 --> 21:39.188
Time for bed, Simon.

23:09.714 --> 23:13.946
-Send in Pedranski and Crandell, please.
- Yes, sir.

23:28.474 --> 23:31.989
Who needs a fix?
Double tall, double dark, double sweet.

23:32.074 --> 23:34.827
Double everything. l'm so glad l missed
the whole drug thing...

23:34.874 --> 23:37.627
so my body was virgin territory
for caffeine.

23:37.714 --> 23:42.026
lt makes me feel so Ricki Lake,
like l can talk to anybody.

23:42.074 --> 23:46.352
What can l say? l'm the Java Queen.
What's wrong?

23:47.394 --> 23:49.225
Kudrow wants to see me.

23:49.314 --> 23:53.102
Cool! Maybe you'll get
your own section.

23:53.194 --> 23:55.071
No. l, uh,
l screwed up.

23:55.154 --> 23:58.351
Well, just go in there
and throw him a Bart Simpson.

23:58.394 --> 24:00.271
Kudrow, dude, chill out.

24:00.354 --> 24:02.993
- lt was that way when l got there.
- Doh!

24:09.394 --> 24:11.544
Puzzle line?

24:11.634 --> 24:14.102
Puzzle line?

24:14.194 --> 24:17.027
Now, l've traveled 10,000 miles
in the past 24 hours.

24:17.074 --> 24:19.952
So l've had a lot of time to reflect
on this. Correct me if l'm wrong.

24:20.034 --> 24:25.062
But l believe neither one of you has
ever said the words ''puzzle line'' to me.

24:26.674 --> 24:30.826
Before Mercury went operational,
we ran a standard validation protocol.

24:30.914 --> 24:33.064
The works. Double sets of paired
Cray supercomputers...

24:33.154 --> 24:36.430
fricking velociraptor machines
chewing at Mercury 24 hours a day.

24:36.474 --> 24:38.032
Mercury came out unbent.

24:38.074 --> 24:41.066
Awesome, sir. lt was finally a code
that couldn't be broken.

24:41.154 --> 24:46.069
But there was one last thing
to check out. The, um... geek factor.

24:46.154 --> 24:49.590
Human beings will fool you sometimes.
We thought it important--

24:49.674 --> 24:54.304
We slipped a message
in one of those egghead word games.
We dared amateurs to crack it.

24:54.354 --> 24:57.073
- We were sure nobody would ever call.
- But somebody did.

24:59.954 --> 25:04.106
His name is Simon Lynch. He lives
in Chicago. He is nine years old.

25:04.194 --> 25:07.584
And he has deciphered a message written
in the most sophisticated code...

25:07.634 --> 25:09.750
the world has ever known...

25:09.834 --> 25:12.906
in a geek's
puzzle magazine.

25:12.994 --> 25:15.064
l don't recall
ever authorizing...

25:15.154 --> 25:17.873
anyone to put any message...

25:17.954 --> 25:19.945
into any magazine!

25:19.994 --> 25:24.033
That couldn't just happen.
A kid couldn't just pop it open.

25:24.114 --> 25:29.063
Not only is he nine years old,
he is handicapped. He is autistic.

25:29.114 --> 25:31.150
Yes, that explains it.

25:31.234 --> 25:34.192
So our $2 billion code
is an open book...

25:34.234 --> 25:36.429
- to people of diminished capacity?
- No, sir.

25:36.514 --> 25:39.551
Autism isn't synonymous
with diminished capacity.

25:39.634 --> 25:42.671
Autistic people are--
They're shut off.

25:42.714 --> 25:45.672
But it's not unusual
for an autistic person to be a savant.

25:45.714 --> 25:48.751
- Oh, a savant!
- He may not be able
to actually decipher the code.

25:48.794 --> 25:50.910
- lt might just appear to him.
- Right. He didn't calculate anything.

25:50.994 --> 25:54.748
He just saw it. Like those stupid
pictures at the mall. You stare at them.

25:54.834 --> 25:57.553
- All of a sudden you're looking
at the Statue of Liberty.
- Exactly.

25:57.634 --> 26:00.910
This is not a stupid picture
at the mall.

26:00.994 --> 26:03.064
This is national security.

26:05.674 --> 26:09.906
Looking at the best case scenario,
let's suppose the boy is unique...

26:09.994 --> 26:12.952
and he doesn't understand
what he's just done.

26:13.034 --> 26:16.265
Does that solve my problem?
Answer: No!

26:16.314 --> 26:19.351
Analysis: All we need now
is for someone else...

26:19.434 --> 26:22.028
who understands his capability
to come along...

26:22.074 --> 26:25.225
and my problems are increased
exponentially.

26:25.274 --> 26:28.186
Then maybe we should talk
to the kid.

26:28.274 --> 26:30.583
- And, uh--
- No.

26:31.954 --> 26:34.070
No. No.

26:36.154 --> 26:39.385
There must be nothing
that connects the boy to this office.

26:39.474 --> 26:42.671
Nothing.
Am l clear?

26:42.714 --> 26:44.067
Yes, sir.

26:44.114 --> 26:46.674
l want you to erase
the tape.

26:46.714 --> 26:48.591
Am l clear?

26:49.594 --> 26:51.346
Yes, sir.

26:54.874 --> 26:57.866
- Honey, will you get that?
- Yeah, l got it.

26:58.674 --> 27:00.710
- Martin Lynch?
- Yeah.

27:00.754 --> 27:02.631
Detective Burrell,
Chicago police.

27:02.674 --> 27:05.313
Sorry to bother you. Can l ask you
a few questions? lt's very important.

27:05.394 --> 27:08.466
-l got your address from Simon's school.
-Something wrong?

27:08.554 --> 27:11.307
lf l drag this out,
it's only gonna make things worse.

27:11.394 --> 27:13.589
One of the other parents
has made accusations...

27:13.674 --> 27:16.188
against Simon's driver
of a sexual nature.

27:16.274 --> 27:20.347
- Oh, my God.
- Well, they're only allegations
at this point.

27:20.434 --> 27:22.265
lf l could step inside
and speak with you.

27:22.354 --> 27:24.265
Uh, sure.

27:25.394 --> 27:28.033
lt won't take more
than a moment.

27:30.194 --> 27:33.869
- l don't want to upset you.
- Well, you've already upset us.

27:33.954 --> 27:37.390
- l'm sorry about that.
- Would you like a cup of coffee?

27:37.474 --> 27:39.669
- Or something?
- Yeah. Yeah, that'd be real nice.

28:05.554 --> 28:09.183
911. Emergency operator 562.

28:11.954 --> 28:13.785
911. Emergency operator 562.

28:13.874 --> 28:17.230
What are you reporting?

28:17.274 --> 28:21.153
l have your location on my screen.
Can you tell me what you're reporting?

29:37.274 --> 29:39.469
Anything while l was gone,
Art?

29:39.514 --> 29:42.824
- Yeah, l think we got
a big break in this case.
- What?

29:42.914 --> 29:46.145
The Attorney General herself
just called in 25 dimes on the Cubs.

29:46.194 --> 29:49.231
What do you think?

29:49.274 --> 29:51.151
Uh--

29:54.194 --> 29:56.788
- Yeah?
- This is 13.

29:56.874 --> 29:59.434
- Cubs ten times.
- Got it.

30:02.074 --> 30:05.783
Dumb bet, 13.
Cubs are in a slump.

30:05.874 --> 30:08.468
Would you mind if l told you
something personal?

30:10.754 --> 30:13.393
Yeah, l would, Roger.

30:13.434 --> 30:15.311
l really would.

30:18.234 --> 30:20.111
Excuse me.

30:20.154 --> 30:22.031
Yeah?

30:22.074 --> 30:24.030
Art, for you.

30:25.434 --> 30:27.311
Yeah?

30:27.354 --> 30:30.551
We're sending someone to spell you.
We've got another assignment for you.

30:30.634 --> 30:33.148
Lomax has another matter
of national security for me?

30:33.234 --> 30:35.702
Check into a possible missing child,
2-1 precinct.

30:35.794 --> 30:37.625
Chicago P.D.
retains jurisdiction.

31:11.154 --> 31:14.146
Yeah. Lacerations.

31:14.194 --> 31:16.071
Nichols.

31:16.114 --> 31:18.548
- You still alive?
- Still here, Art.

31:18.634 --> 31:22.513
- How are ya?
- All right.

31:22.554 --> 31:26.547
What is this?
lt's supposed to be a missing kid.

31:26.634 --> 31:29.706
lt is.
These are the parents.

31:29.794 --> 31:31.625
Looks like
a murder-suicide.

31:32.674 --> 31:34.505
So where's the kid?

31:34.594 --> 31:37.313
Missing, remember?

31:37.394 --> 31:39.225
What are you
doin' here?

31:39.314 --> 31:42.989
Somebody called the F.B.l.
and they sent me. Go figure.

31:43.074 --> 31:45.713
No, l meant,
what are you doin' here?

31:45.754 --> 31:50.509
Workin' my way to the bottom, Jack,
just like you.

31:50.594 --> 31:53.791
The kid's name is Simon.
Neighbors say he's retarded.

31:53.874 --> 31:56.513
Guys who kill their families
kill all of 'em.

31:56.594 --> 32:00.109
Maybe he did the kid somewhere else.
Didn't want Mom to see.

32:00.154 --> 32:03.510
Kid like that
costs a bundle.

32:03.594 --> 32:07.030
Maybe Dad got tired of knocking himself
out for a kid who didn't know better.

32:07.114 --> 32:10.186
Put 'em all out
of their misery.

32:10.234 --> 32:13.544
How's a guy that's so broke
afford a $1500 handgun?

32:16.434 --> 32:19.824
- Mind if l take a look around, Jack?
- We already did.

32:19.914 --> 32:22.223
- The kid's not here.
- Does that mean you mind?

32:22.314 --> 32:25.147
- Hey, be my guest.
- Thanks.

32:25.234 --> 32:28.112
By the way, Lomax called.
He said it's important.

32:28.154 --> 32:30.509
Yeah, l bet.
Got a phone on you?

32:32.194 --> 32:34.025
What do you know?

32:34.114 --> 32:37.072
- Thanks.
- Be sure l get it back.

32:39.074 --> 32:41.429
- How are ya?
- Good.

34:00.714 --> 34:02.545
How ya doin', champ?

34:02.634 --> 34:04.670
You okay in there?

34:06.034 --> 34:07.865
Come on.

34:07.954 --> 34:10.831
You can come on out now.

34:10.873 --> 34:12.909
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

34:15.194 --> 34:18.344
l'm not gonna hurt ya.
Okay?

34:19.674 --> 34:21.551
Come on.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.425
Come on.

34:26.474 --> 34:28.942
No, no, no, no!
Simon! All right.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.025
Quiet! Quiet!

34:41.554 --> 34:43.385
Call Concordia.

34:43.474 --> 34:45.385
Get an ambulance
over here.

34:45.474 --> 34:47.829
- Have some badges waiting
for us when we get there.
- For what?

34:47.914 --> 34:51.145
- l want this kid protected.
- How am l gonna justify
the overtime?

34:52.353 --> 34:54.914
Since when you worry
about overtime, Jack?

34:54.994 --> 34:57.269
The coroner says
murder-suicide, they can go.

34:57.354 --> 35:00.744
Anybody asks about the overtime,
put it on Lomax's Gold Card.

35:11.194 --> 35:13.708
- Straps are just makin' him worse.
- They're for his own safety.

35:13.794 --> 35:16.592
- Unstrap him.
- They're for his own safety.

35:16.634 --> 35:19.023
All right. Simon,
we're gonna unstrap you.

35:19.114 --> 35:22.823
Take it easy. Simon, just calm down.
All right?

35:22.914 --> 35:26.429
Mommy! Daddy!
Mommy! Daddy!

35:26.514 --> 35:29.472
Tell him to turn that off!

35:29.554 --> 35:31.784
Turn the siren off!

35:31.834 --> 35:33.711
Simon, ho. Hey!

35:33.754 --> 35:37.713
Now look. Who's this? ls that your
mommy right there? ls that your mommy?

35:37.794 --> 35:40.262
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Right there?

35:40.354 --> 35:42.663
Yes, that's right.
Your mommy. That's her.

35:42.714 --> 35:46.070
- ls that your daddy?
- Daddy.

35:46.154 --> 35:48.110
Right.

35:48.194 --> 35:51.072
''Do not touch. lt may be hot.''
That's very good advice.

35:51.154 --> 35:54.863
ls that your teacher?
Dr. London?

35:54.954 --> 35:58.663
She's your friend, right?
My name is Art. l'm your friend too.

35:58.754 --> 36:01.666
Art is a stranger!

36:01.714 --> 36:04.751
Art is a stranger!

36:06.914 --> 36:09.553
Art is a stranger!

36:09.594 --> 36:11.471
Okay, strap him in.

36:11.514 --> 36:14.665
l won't hurt you.

36:26.874 --> 36:30.184
- Hi. Are you the doctor?
- Um, no, l'm the nurse.

36:30.274 --> 36:33.152
- ls a doctor gonna see this boy?
- Uh, l took care of him.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.623
ls that the best you could do for him,
just give him a shot?

36:35.674 --> 36:37.983
He's autistic.

36:38.034 --> 36:40.594
- Autistic?
- Uh-huh.

36:40.674 --> 36:43.472
What does that mean?

36:43.554 --> 36:45.465
Nothing gets through?

36:45.554 --> 36:48.990
No, it's just the opposite.
Everything gets through.

36:49.074 --> 36:51.793
He has trouble with feelings
and emotions.

36:51.834 --> 36:54.826
So he gets very frightened
and confused.

36:54.874 --> 36:59.629
Wait. l'm not gonna be able
to question this boy?

36:59.674 --> 37:01.392
Probably not.

37:01.474 --> 37:03.430
Sorry.

37:17.554 --> 37:19.385
Take care of him.

37:25.554 --> 37:27.829
Why are we doing this, Dean?

37:27.914 --> 37:30.747
Why does he want to see us?
We didn't do anything wrong, right?

37:30.834 --> 37:32.586
Should l turn around?

37:32.674 --> 37:35.552
- No, he'd kill us.
- He might kill us anyway.

37:35.634 --> 37:39.388
- Are you being serious?
- Relax, Leo, please.

37:52.834 --> 37:55.302
Okay, l'm scared.
l'm gettin' really, really scared.

37:55.394 --> 37:59.387
Leo, stop it. We're doing this together.
We didn't break any laws.

37:59.474 --> 38:03.706
No matter what he says or does, we're
gonna do the right thing. So just relax.

38:05.394 --> 38:07.066
Jesus!

38:07.154 --> 38:11.306
- Okay. Can we go home now, please?
- Yeah, all right.

38:14.714 --> 38:16.909
lt's him.

38:19.474 --> 38:22.193
- Let's just get this over with.
- Okay.

38:38.594 --> 38:41.062
This changes everything.

38:42.474 --> 38:45.227
- Now somebody else knows.
- Oh, God.

38:45.274 --> 38:47.629
- What happened to the boy?
- He's alive.

38:47.674 --> 38:52.429
He's being held in a lockdown unit
in a Chicago hospital.

38:52.474 --> 38:54.351
Why don't we tell
somebody?

38:54.434 --> 38:56.265
Because we are somebody,
Leo.

38:56.354 --> 38:58.788
We're the ones that are
ultimately responsible for this.

38:58.834 --> 39:00.870
There isn't anybody
to tell.

39:00.914 --> 39:03.951
So l want you to keep
the puzzle line open 24 hours a day.

39:04.034 --> 39:06.343
And l want you two to do
your goddamn fuckin' jobs!

39:06.434 --> 39:08.504
Quiet!

39:11.994 --> 39:15.430
Maybe l'm goin' about this
the wrong way.

39:15.474 --> 39:18.511
My wife says my people skills
are like my cooking skills.

39:18.554 --> 39:20.749
Quick and tasteless.

39:20.834 --> 39:23.632
But in the end,
it's about saving lives.

39:23.714 --> 39:25.545
lsn't that the point?

39:25.634 --> 39:28.273
- Yes?
- Yes.

39:28.314 --> 39:31.465
l know a man named Rasheed Halabi,
born in Paramus, New Jersey.

39:31.554 --> 39:34.273
Valedictorian of his high school class,
worked his way through M.l.T.

39:34.354 --> 39:37.312
Right now he's a colonel
in Saddam's Republican Guard.

39:37.394 --> 39:41.467
We put him there. lt's him
this code is protecting.

39:41.554 --> 39:44.705
There are thousands of other
men and women just like him...

39:44.754 --> 39:47.951
whose identities are protected
by this code.

39:48.034 --> 39:50.025
We can save their lives.

39:50.114 --> 39:54.232
l give you my pledge.
l want you to give me yours.

39:54.314 --> 39:57.704
Diligence, loyalty
and above all...

39:59.514 --> 40:01.391
absolute silence.

40:03.714 --> 40:06.512
This is kind of an interesting story.

40:06.554 --> 40:09.068
The television program 60 Minutes
right here on CBS?

40:27.794 --> 40:32.072
l've changed tires doin' 86.
You know what l'm sayin'?

40:45.554 --> 40:48.307
Long ways from home

40:48.394 --> 40:51.147
Can't sleep at night

40:51.194 --> 40:55.267
Grab your telephone 'cause
something just ain't right

40:55.314 --> 40:57.225
lt's evil

40:59.074 --> 41:01.872
Evil is goin' on

41:05.874 --> 41:10.072
Well, l'm warnin' you,
girl

41:10.154 --> 41:12.304
You better watch
your happy home

41:17.754 --> 41:20.314
Long ways from home

41:20.394 --> 41:24.672
Can't sleep at all
'Cause another--

41:45.994 --> 41:47.825
Where is everyone?

41:47.914 --> 41:49.950
Where's the police? Where's the guard
that was sitting right here?

41:50.034 --> 41:52.070
They were called off half an hour ago.
Told they weren't needed.

41:52.114 --> 41:54.389
Take me to see Simon Lynch right now.
Unlock that door.

41:54.474 --> 41:57.307
We just transferred him
to pediatrics.

41:57.394 --> 42:00.591
- Where's that?
- Room 1106. Up those stairs one flight.

42:00.634 --> 42:02.989
- Who authorized the transfer?
- His parents.

42:03.034 --> 42:05.912
l could understand.
They didn't want their little kid on--

42:43.314 --> 42:45.270
Can l help you?

42:47.154 --> 42:49.714
Hi. l'm with the F.B.l.

42:49.794 --> 42:52.706
l'm lookin' for Simon Lynch.
Do you know where he is?

42:52.754 --> 42:55.222
He suffered a minor head injury.
Nothing serious.

42:55.314 --> 42:58.624
We had to take him
down to X-ray.

42:58.674 --> 43:00.665
Where is the X-ray room?

43:00.754 --> 43:02.984
Radiology.
Seventh floor.

43:03.074 --> 43:05.110
Great. Thanks.

43:06.194 --> 43:08.424
No problem.

44:15.194 --> 44:17.389
Shh. Shh. Shh.

44:17.434 --> 44:19.629
Shh. Ow!

44:31.634 --> 44:34.228
Here we go. Here we go.
Simon, get in the elevator.

44:34.314 --> 44:37.033
- Hi. Yeah.
- A little crowded, huh?

44:41.114 --> 44:43.070
Just made it, Doctor.

44:43.154 --> 44:45.384
You must be new.
Welcome to Concordia.

44:45.434 --> 44:47.664
Thank you.
You're very kind.

44:52.194 --> 44:54.105
Eight.

44:54.194 --> 44:56.424
Seven.

44:56.514 --> 44:58.232
Six.

44:58.314 --> 45:01.226
Five.

45:03.034 --> 45:05.753
Four.

45:05.834 --> 45:09.270
Three.
Two.

45:09.354 --> 45:11.629
One.

45:11.674 --> 45:13.904
Thanks for the ride.
Good night.

45:13.994 --> 45:16.030
Wait!

45:17.994 --> 45:19.712
What's going on?

45:31.514 --> 45:33.470
Get up in that seat.

45:35.314 --> 45:38.465
Move it!

45:52.354 --> 45:54.743
All right, leave it off.
Leave it off.

45:54.834 --> 45:57.109
Come on, Simon. We don't need
any more attention right now.

45:59.354 --> 46:01.868
Leave it alone,
all right?

46:01.954 --> 46:06.232
Keep off the buttons.
Okay, okay, okay!

46:07.954 --> 46:10.024
Leave the buttons alone,
goddamn it!

46:10.074 --> 46:14.192
Please. Please.

46:18.154 --> 46:21.703
''One small step
for mankind.''

46:26.714 --> 46:28.466
Get down!

46:53.194 --> 46:55.310
Mommy! Daddy!
Mommy! Daddy!

46:55.354 --> 46:57.231
Mommy! Daddy!

46:57.314 --> 46:59.748
Mommy! Daddy!
Mommy! Daddy!

46:59.794 --> 47:02.706
Mommy! Daddy!
Mommy! Daddy!

47:03.634 --> 47:07.149
Let's go.
Hang on to the fence.

47:07.234 --> 47:10.670
Hang on to the fence.
Hang on to the fence.

47:10.754 --> 47:12.949
Let's go.

47:29.834 --> 47:33.588
No! No!

47:34.754 --> 47:38.190
Simon! No!

48:12.794 --> 48:16.992
Come on. Let's go, Simon.
Come on.

49:05.794 --> 49:07.989
''Friends.''

49:08.074 --> 49:11.305
''Mr. Pasquale.''
Bus driver.

49:11.394 --> 49:13.544
Pasqual-ee.

49:13.634 --> 49:16.706
Pasqual-ee? That's his name,
Mr. Pasquale?

49:17.994 --> 49:20.110
''Do not talk to strangers.''

49:20.194 --> 49:22.754
ls that why you won't talk to me?
You think l'm a stranger?

49:35.634 --> 49:37.829
Art.

49:37.874 --> 49:40.468
That's me.
l'm your friend.

49:40.554 --> 49:45.389
- See? Art is your friend.
- No! Art is a stranger!

49:45.434 --> 49:48.267
- Okay, Simon. Okay.
- Art is a stranger!

49:48.314 --> 49:50.828
- All right!
- Art is a stranger!

49:52.754 --> 49:55.666
Art is a stranger.

51:06.674 --> 51:09.427
Motherfucker!

51:22.674 --> 51:24.710
Who are you?

51:37.234 --> 51:39.384
All right.

51:42.234 --> 51:46.671
l'm sorry, Tommy.
Come on, Simon.

51:46.714 --> 51:48.670
What the hell
happened to you?

51:59.394 --> 52:01.703
You kidnapped this kid
from the hospital? Are you crazy?

52:01.794 --> 52:04.308
- What are you talking about?
- Lomax has been calling me
every 15 minutes.

52:04.394 --> 52:07.830
- There's a warrant out
for your arrest.
- l killed a guy on the C.T.A.

52:07.914 --> 52:11.463
- Oh, Christ!
- l had to. He was trying to kill us.

52:11.554 --> 52:15.229
- How did this happen?
- Somebody pulled the cops off
the kid at the hospital.

52:15.314 --> 52:17.544
lt's not a murder-suicide.
The mom and dad got in the way.

52:17.594 --> 52:21.382
They're trying to get the kid. lf he
hadn't hidden, they'd have got him too.

52:21.474 --> 52:25.149
- l cannot handle
this paranoid conspiracy crap.
- lt is a conspiracy.

52:25.234 --> 52:27.065
Who pulled the cops
off the kid?

52:27.154 --> 52:31.033
Did dead Martin and Jenny say
''Take my kid out of protective
custody''? This is real!

52:31.114 --> 52:32.945
l don't give a fuck
if it's real.

52:33.034 --> 52:36.913
lf l don't call Lomax right now,
l'm an accessory to this.

52:36.994 --> 52:40.828
lf you don't get on the phone now, call
Concordia or C.T.A., you're a dumb cop.

52:44.314 --> 52:48.023
Tell them to bring
a body bag to put the pieces in.

52:49.314 --> 52:51.350
Arthur.

52:51.434 --> 52:54.710
Hi, Dana.
Sorry we woke you up.

52:54.794 --> 52:56.989
- lt's good to see you.
- You too.

52:57.074 --> 52:59.713
lt's been too long.

52:59.794 --> 53:02.706
Try not to bleed
on my carpet.

53:07.234 --> 53:09.111
His name's Simon.

53:12.394 --> 53:14.225
Hello, Simon.

53:15.314 --> 53:17.987
l bet you're hungry.

53:18.034 --> 53:21.310
l have peanut butter and jelly
in the kitchen. How's that sound?

53:22.994 --> 53:25.110
This is my son T.J.

53:25.194 --> 53:27.469
- T.J., this is Simon.
- Hi.

53:27.514 --> 53:30.631
Why don't we go
in the kitchen--

53:35.354 --> 53:38.187
T.J., why don't we go in the kitchen
and make something to eat...

53:38.274 --> 53:41.107
and maybe Simon
will come with us?

54:00.914 --> 54:02.745
Here you go, Art.

54:02.834 --> 54:06.110
lt's still damp,
but at least it's clean.

54:06.194 --> 54:08.185
- Thanks, Dana.
- You're welcome.

54:09.874 --> 54:13.833
Simon, l think these
will fit you.

54:13.874 --> 54:16.434
Not my Frank Thomas shirt!

54:16.474 --> 54:18.783
Remember what
l told you about sharing?

54:18.834 --> 54:21.632
l thought you were done
taking those downers.

54:22.834 --> 54:25.712
Yeah. So?

54:25.754 --> 54:28.791
- There's no body on the El tracks.
- What?

54:28.874 --> 54:32.184
No body. No blood.
No casing. Nothing.

54:32.274 --> 54:35.311
Who could've got it cleaned up
that fast?

54:35.354 --> 54:37.345
- Give him up.
- What?

54:37.394 --> 54:40.386
The kid. Give him up.
Take him back.

54:40.434 --> 54:43.949
- Would you give your own kid up?
- lt's not your kid!

54:44.034 --> 54:47.663
Yeah? Well, right now,
he's nobody's kid.

54:47.754 --> 54:51.349
His mom and dad got shot dead
by a real bad guy. Remember?

54:52.794 --> 54:56.503
- Let's go, Simon.
- Let me get these clothes on him.

54:56.594 --> 54:58.983
l need your car keys.

55:00.474 --> 55:04.990
Let me just walk around
the streets with this kid now? Come on.

55:09.074 --> 55:12.749
-l'm reporting it stolen in the mornin'.
-Thanks.

55:24.874 --> 55:28.503
Daddy is going to sing

55:28.594 --> 55:32.428
Daddy is going to sing

55:32.474 --> 55:36.592
Daddy is going to sing

55:36.634 --> 55:40.866
- Daddy is going to sing
- How can you not be tired?

55:40.914 --> 55:43.986
Daddy is going to sing

55:44.074 --> 55:48.829
Daddy's not here right now,
Simon.

55:48.914 --> 55:51.906
Daddy is going to sing

55:51.954 --> 55:55.913
l told you, your daddy
is not here now!

55:55.954 --> 55:59.788
Oh, God. How am l supposed
to explain this?

56:02.034 --> 56:05.822
Daddy is going to sing

56:05.874 --> 56:09.230
Daddy is going to sing

56:09.274 --> 56:11.947
Daddy is going to sing

56:12.034 --> 56:15.629
Just going to close
my eyes for a minute.

56:45.274 --> 56:47.788
Damn! Shit!

56:47.874 --> 56:51.230
Stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid!

57:00.594 --> 57:03.745
Come on, Simon.

57:04.754 --> 57:07.871
Where the hell are you?

57:38.594 --> 57:41.984
Simon? Simon.

58:04.634 --> 58:06.704
Let's go for a ride.

58:21.114 --> 58:24.743
Left.
Left on Kenwood.

58:24.794 --> 58:26.671
Left.

58:26.714 --> 58:30.389
Okay.
We are going left.

58:32.274 --> 58:36.506
Howard Avenue to ''J'' Street.

58:36.594 --> 58:39.392
That's right.

58:39.474 --> 58:41.988
''J'' Street...

58:42.034 --> 58:47.392
to West Twenty-Third Street.

58:47.474 --> 58:49.430
You know where
we're goin'?

58:49.514 --> 58:52.665
Simon is going home.

58:53.794 --> 58:57.309
Yeah.
Simon is going home.

59:14.434 --> 59:16.311
Come on, come on.

59:20.074 --> 59:23.146
Mommy, Simon is home.

59:37.594 --> 59:39.664
Mommy!

59:39.754 --> 59:42.712
Simon is home.

59:44.794 --> 59:47.183
Simon is home.

59:57.554 --> 59:59.431
Want this?

01:00:09.394 --> 01:00:12.147
Very hot.

01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:15.067
Sip it slowly.

01:01:15.954 --> 01:01:19.424
Get it, please.

01:01:22.194 --> 01:01:24.947
Congratulations.

01:01:29.554 --> 01:01:32.068
Can l please have your name,

01:01:32.114 --> 01:01:34.105
You are...

01:01:34.194 --> 01:01:36.424
a stranger.

01:01:36.474 --> 01:01:40.945
That's him! He's calling from
his own house. We have to call Kudrow.

01:01:41.034 --> 01:01:43.264
- What are you doing?
- ls that you, Simon?

01:01:43.314 --> 01:01:48.104
- Simon, is that you?
- Let me have the phone.
Who is this?

01:01:48.154 --> 01:01:50.668
Answer me!
Who is this? Hello?

01:01:50.714 --> 01:01:53.069
This is the F.B.l. We have this number
and we will trace it.

01:01:53.114 --> 01:01:57.983
- Who is this?
- No, you won't.
You can't trace this number.

01:01:58.034 --> 01:01:59.911
Who is this?
What agency do you work for?

01:01:59.954 --> 01:02:02.673
- Answer me.
- Dean, do not tell him who we are.

01:02:02.714 --> 01:02:05.387
Please don't tell him
my name.

01:02:05.474 --> 01:02:07.783
l need some more time,
all right?

01:02:07.834 --> 01:02:10.507
Don't call this number again.

01:02:10.554 --> 01:02:12.749
l'm gonna set up
an E-mail address.

01:02:12.794 --> 01:02:15.069
Einstein.
Check it in the morning.

01:02:15.154 --> 01:02:17.873
No, no, don't hang--

01:02:29.554 --> 01:02:31.784
Mommy, Daddy.

01:02:31.874 --> 01:02:34.183
Come on, Simon,
let's go. Come on.

01:02:34.234 --> 01:02:37.306
- Mommy, Daddy.
- Let's go. Come on.

01:02:37.394 --> 01:02:39.624
That's it.
Come on.

01:02:43.914 --> 01:02:47.987
- Dean, please don't do this.
- lf he did it once, he can do it again.

01:02:48.074 --> 01:02:50.827
You think this F.B.l. agent is smart
enough to figure out what you're doing?

01:02:50.874 --> 01:02:55.026
- He better be, because
that boy's life is at stake.
- This is bad.

01:02:55.114 --> 01:02:58.186
lt's not fair to me, because
he'll assume l was in on it too!

01:02:58.234 --> 01:03:00.304
l don't think
they can hear you on the moon.

01:03:00.394 --> 01:03:02.589
- Listen.
- l don't want to listen to you.
You're scaring me.

01:03:02.674 --> 01:03:05.142
lf anything happens to me,
you're gonna know who did it.

01:03:05.234 --> 01:03:07.384
l expect you to do what
you're supposed to do.

01:03:09.714 --> 01:03:11.750
No.

01:03:11.794 --> 01:03:15.673
You will.
l know it.

01:03:19.674 --> 01:03:21.790
Try C.l.A.

01:03:21.874 --> 01:03:23.705
Nope.

01:03:23.794 --> 01:03:26.024
Let's try F.B.l.

01:03:36.074 --> 01:03:38.463
- Good, good.
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:40.903
Um... Albert.

01:03:47.634 --> 01:03:50.706
Try ''E'' equals ''M-C'' squared,
all caps.

01:03:54.474 --> 01:03:56.942
Mm-hmm.

01:04:04.154 --> 01:04:07.066
- l'll give you some privacy.
- Thanks.

01:04:18.194 --> 01:04:21.311
Hey, partner...

01:04:21.394 --> 01:04:24.227
l need your help
with something.

01:04:24.274 --> 01:04:26.993
lt's a puzzle.

01:04:27.074 --> 01:04:30.032
Can you help me
with a puzzle?

01:04:30.114 --> 01:04:32.423
- Puzzle.
- That's right. A puzzle.

01:04:32.474 --> 01:04:35.068
lt's right over here.
Come on.

01:04:40.594 --> 01:04:43.870
All right. l'm gonna
lift you up now, okay?

01:04:43.954 --> 01:04:46.309
Let's put you up
on the chair.

01:04:48.914 --> 01:04:52.589
Can you read that?

01:04:52.634 --> 01:04:55.467
Simon, what does it say?

01:04:57.114 --> 01:04:58.991
''Today.

01:04:59.034 --> 01:05:01.070
''12:00.

01:05:01.114 --> 01:05:04.026
The Wrigley Building.''

01:05:04.114 --> 01:05:06.423
Good boy.

01:05:06.714 --> 01:05:09.353
l'm gonna start to take this personally
if you don't--

01:05:09.394 --> 01:05:11.703
Hello? Hello?

01:05:11.794 --> 01:05:13.671
Oh!

01:05:13.714 --> 01:05:15.989
Oh, l'm sorry, sorry.
Are you okay?

01:05:16.074 --> 01:05:18.030
l'm fine, really.
l'm sorry.

01:05:18.074 --> 01:05:21.384
lt was my fault. l should've watched
where l was going.

01:05:21.434 --> 01:05:23.390
No, l shouldn't
have had it there.

01:05:23.474 --> 01:05:26.511
The way my day's going,
l'm lucky you didn't trip and sue me.

01:05:26.554 --> 01:05:29.864
What do you got in there?
Plumbing supplies?

01:05:29.914 --> 01:05:34.112
Look, this is gonna sound crazy,
but l have a little problem...

01:05:34.194 --> 01:05:36.754
and l was wondering
if you could help me out.

01:05:36.794 --> 01:05:39.433
You see that little boy
sitting over there?

01:05:39.474 --> 01:05:42.546
Do you think you could watch him
for a couple of minutes?

01:05:42.634 --> 01:05:46.627
You didn't just accidentally
trip over the case, did you?

01:05:46.674 --> 01:05:51.145
He's autistic.
And l'm his Big Brother.

01:05:51.234 --> 01:05:55.113
Not his real big brother, you know?
Big Brothers of America.

01:05:55.154 --> 01:05:58.464
lt's going really well, but l need
to get a prescription filled for him.

01:05:58.514 --> 01:06:03.144
Normally l'd take him with me,
but l don't like to disturb him
when he's sitting so calmly.

01:06:03.194 --> 01:06:06.425
You don't have to do anything.
Just sit here and be your lovely self.

01:06:06.514 --> 01:06:08.425
Please.

01:06:08.474 --> 01:06:12.228
- Okay, yeah. What's his name?
- Simon.

01:06:12.274 --> 01:06:14.230
- You sure this is okay?
- Yeah.

01:06:14.314 --> 01:06:17.465
lf l can handle a district manager,
l can handle anyone.

01:06:17.554 --> 01:06:21.183
Thank you. l will be right back.
Oh!

01:06:21.234 --> 01:06:23.304
- What's your name?
- Stacey.

01:06:23.394 --> 01:06:26.192
- Stacey--
- Sebring.

01:06:26.234 --> 01:06:29.704
Stacey, thank you so much.
l'll be right back. l promise.

01:06:33.394 --> 01:06:36.306
Would have done it
without the flattery?

01:06:42.194 --> 01:06:44.071
Hey, Simon.

01:06:58.194 --> 01:07:00.344
Just keep walking.
Keep walking.

01:07:00.434 --> 01:07:02.823
- Jeffries?
- Just keep walking.

01:07:02.874 --> 01:07:05.069
l wasn't sure
you'd be here.

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:09.147
Simon's read the code twice. That's
really incredible. Also very dangerous.

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:12.192
- Who do you work for? The C.l.A.?
- No.

01:07:12.274 --> 01:07:15.471
- The Defense Department?
- l'm afraid you're not that lucky.

01:07:15.514 --> 01:07:18.551
l think the F.B.l. likes to call us
''No Such Agency.''

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:22.673
- Why does the N.S.A. want
a 9-year-old autistic boy?
- The brain is still a mystery.

01:07:22.714 --> 01:07:24.193
What?

01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:26.424
The Reagan administration mandated
the National Security Agency...

01:07:26.514 --> 01:07:29.824
to generate a new code
to protect American informants
working for foreign governments.

01:07:29.874 --> 01:07:32.991
We developed a super code
at huge expense.

01:07:33.074 --> 01:07:37.192
Named it Mercury.
We thought it was impenetrable.

01:07:37.234 --> 01:07:39.794
You're telling me a kid cracked
a government super code?

01:07:39.834 --> 01:07:42.428
lt doesn't matter.
He can read it.

01:07:42.514 --> 01:07:45.790
He might even be able to recreate it.
That's why his life is in danger.

01:07:45.874 --> 01:07:50.231
- N.S.A. is willing to have this
boy killed to protect a code?
- We may have already tried.

01:07:50.314 --> 01:07:54.102
l think my division chief
may have given orders--

01:07:54.194 --> 01:07:57.391
l'm a cryptographer, a nerd.
l don't know what these people do.

01:07:57.474 --> 01:08:00.113
Maybe it's routine killing kids,
or maybe my boss is an aberration.

01:08:08.154 --> 01:08:11.146
Call an ambulance!
Get an ambulance!

01:08:11.194 --> 01:08:14.152
Move it! Move it!

01:08:14.194 --> 01:08:16.185
Get out of the way!
Move it!

01:08:17.234 --> 01:08:19.270
Excuse me.
Watch out! Watch out!

01:08:19.314 --> 01:08:22.590
- Get out of the way!
- Watch out! Watch out!

01:08:22.674 --> 01:08:25.188
- Move it! Goddamn it, move!
- Move!

01:08:26.234 --> 01:08:28.828
Move it!
Get out of the way!

01:08:28.913 --> 01:08:32.384
Look out! Look out!
Move! Get out of the way!

01:08:36.073 --> 01:08:38.144
Get down! Get down!

01:09:16.913 --> 01:09:18.745
Goddamn it.

01:09:41.834 --> 01:09:45.827
Excuse me. F.B.l.
Where's your security office?

01:09:45.874 --> 01:09:48.341
- Through the door to the right.
- Thank you.

01:10:02.314 --> 01:10:05.033
Hi. Special Agent Jeffries
with the F.B.l.

01:10:05.074 --> 01:10:07.634
- Can l help you?
- l hope so.

01:10:09.114 --> 01:10:12.743
- Where's the tape for this camera?
- Um, here it is.

01:10:24.274 --> 01:10:27.425
No, um... look,
it's my ass if you take that.

01:10:27.474 --> 01:10:30.591
Then don't tell anyone.
Thank you.

01:10:45.714 --> 01:10:48.308
Damn it.

01:11:01.114 --> 01:11:03.628
Excuse me,
excuse me please.

01:11:03.674 --> 01:11:05.551
Excuse me.
Whoa!

01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:10.426
Hey! Come on.
We gotta go.

01:11:12.274 --> 01:11:14.185
- Sorry.
- What happened?

01:11:14.274 --> 01:11:17.584
He almost got away. You didn't tell me
l have to watch him every second.

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:19.983
Sorry. l shouldn't
have left the coffee shop.

01:11:20.074 --> 01:11:22.668
No! No!

01:11:22.754 --> 01:11:24.585
All right, all right.

01:11:24.674 --> 01:11:28.189
Don't scream, don't scream.
All right.

01:11:29.834 --> 01:11:31.984
Oh, my God.

01:11:32.074 --> 01:11:34.383
He doesn't see things
like other people do.

01:11:43.634 --> 01:11:46.944
Where did you just go?
Rob a bank or something?

01:11:50.514 --> 01:11:52.869
l gotta get him out of here.
Let's go, Simon.

01:11:52.914 --> 01:11:57.226
Thank you, Stacey.
Thanks for all your help. Come on.

01:12:06.354 --> 01:12:09.027
- My dad will kill for this. How much?
- One hundred.

01:12:09.074 --> 01:12:11.952
Get real.
Hey!

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:15.304
Have you ever thought, what are
we gonna collect when we get old?

01:12:15.354 --> 01:12:18.869
Plaid shirts
and Kramer dolls?

01:12:18.954 --> 01:12:20.831
What's the matter?

01:12:23.434 --> 01:12:26.631
- Dean is dead. He's been shot.
- What?

01:12:28.034 --> 01:12:30.389
He wanted to go to Chicago.
l said, ''Don't go.''

01:12:30.474 --> 01:12:33.386
He wanted me to go with him
and help him.

01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:36.386
Someone shot him?
Who would shoot him?

01:12:36.434 --> 01:12:38.311
l can't tell you.

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:41.744
Leo, l want to help you,
but you have to let me in.

01:12:41.834 --> 01:12:44.029
Tell me what's going on.

01:12:44.114 --> 01:12:47.584
- He'll find out.
- Who? You mean Kudrow?

01:12:47.634 --> 01:12:50.228
l don't have the capabilities
to E-mail over his head.

01:12:50.314 --> 01:12:52.544
l can't use the phone
because everything gets recorded.

01:12:52.594 --> 01:12:56.792
Everything is connected to everything.
There is nothing l can do.

01:13:07.634 --> 01:13:10.546
Low-tech rules.

01:13:34.634 --> 01:13:36.590
Congratulations.

01:13:36.634 --> 01:13:39.706
As of this morning, you made it
to the very top of our own perp board.

01:13:39.794 --> 01:13:42.513
l don't have to tell you
how profoundly pissed Lomax is.

01:13:42.554 --> 01:13:46.388
He's keeping a lid on it to cover
his ass, but you don't have much time.

01:13:46.474 --> 01:13:50.103
Yeah. Did you find out
who the shooter is?

01:13:50.194 --> 01:13:53.709
Whatever happened to, ''Good morning.
How are you? Sorry about your car.

01:13:53.754 --> 01:13:57.064
lt got impounded. You won't be able
to get it for two weeks.''

01:13:57.154 --> 01:14:01.067
- Did you get in trouble?
- No. l told them you stole it.

01:14:02.834 --> 01:14:05.109
Found him in the
Defense Department data banks.

01:14:05.194 --> 01:14:08.072
His name is Peter Burrell,
Special Forces.

01:14:09.394 --> 01:14:11.271
So, let's bring him in.

01:14:11.314 --> 01:14:15.023
Can't. Unless you want
to dig him up. He's dead.

01:14:15.114 --> 01:14:18.345
He's listed as killed
in Beirut in 1982.

01:14:22.194 --> 01:14:24.230
You still think
l'm paranoid?

01:14:24.274 --> 01:14:26.742
l don't know, man.
Who knows?

01:14:26.834 --> 01:14:29.871
But if you are, then l guess l'm
paranoid too. We're in over our heads.

01:14:29.914 --> 01:14:32.144
- We can't fuck with the N.S.A.
- So?

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:37.592
- We find somebody
to talk to about this.
- Lomax? He's a Company man.

01:14:37.674 --> 01:14:40.313
- The N.S.A. could've gotten to him too.
- Fine. l'll go above Lomax.

01:14:40.394 --> 01:14:42.988
l don't want you
to do anything else.

01:14:43.034 --> 01:14:47.346
You got a wife and kid to take care of.
Go do that. Really.

01:14:47.434 --> 01:14:49.504
All right then.
What are you gonna do?

01:14:51.354 --> 01:14:53.231
l don't know.

01:14:53.274 --> 01:14:56.072
Why are you doing this, Art?

01:14:56.114 --> 01:14:58.548
That kid isn't
your responsibility.

01:14:58.634 --> 01:15:01.353
Whose responsibility
is he?

01:15:03.354 --> 01:15:06.664
Look at him.

01:15:06.754 --> 01:15:09.632
He looks like
a regular kid, right?

01:15:09.714 --> 01:15:13.548
One little circuit
gets crossed. Zap!

01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:16.068
He should've been smart,
go to college...

01:15:16.114 --> 01:15:20.266
meet a girl, get married,
have some kids, be cool.

01:15:22.074 --> 01:15:25.384
Are we talking about him, Art,
or are we talking about you?

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:33.588
Thanks for getting this
together for me.

01:15:33.674 --> 01:15:35.869
Be careful.

01:15:35.954 --> 01:15:37.467
Yeah.

01:15:55.154 --> 01:15:57.873
Jesus!

01:15:57.914 --> 01:16:00.474
Who the fuck are you?

01:16:00.554 --> 01:16:03.466
Oh. Oh.

01:16:03.514 --> 01:16:05.391
Please. Please--

01:16:48.594 --> 01:16:52.348
Okay! Oh. You.
What do you want?

01:16:52.434 --> 01:16:57.269
lt's 2:00 in the morning,
and you don't know me this well.

01:16:57.354 --> 01:17:00.949
- l need to talk to you.
- You're gonna wake up my neighbors.

01:17:03.034 --> 01:17:05.673
Oh, man.

01:17:09.234 --> 01:17:11.350
We need a place to stay.

01:17:11.434 --> 01:17:14.312
- How'd you get this address?
- l looked it up.

01:17:14.354 --> 01:17:16.470
No, it's not listed.

01:17:16.554 --> 01:17:20.706
The name of your company was on the side
of your sample case. l called them.

01:17:20.754 --> 01:17:25.066
Right. Call my company, ask 'em
for my address, they give it to you?

01:17:25.114 --> 01:17:26.752
Nope.

01:17:26.834 --> 01:17:31.066
Please. Stacey.

01:17:31.154 --> 01:17:33.873
l'm an F.B.l. agent.

01:17:33.914 --> 01:17:37.224
Yeah. l bought one of those
for my little brother, $5.

01:17:37.274 --> 01:17:40.550
l saw you hiding from the police today.
l'll give them a call.

01:17:40.594 --> 01:17:44.553
Listen.
l really am an F.B.l agent.

01:17:44.594 --> 01:17:47.552
Please help us.

01:17:47.634 --> 01:17:51.422
- Hello, Simon.
- Hello.

01:17:52.954 --> 01:17:54.831
Please.

01:17:54.874 --> 01:17:56.944
Move your foot.

01:18:08.954 --> 01:18:10.592
Thank you.

01:18:13.554 --> 01:18:16.193
Thank you very much.

01:18:16.274 --> 01:18:20.631
Would it be stupid to ask
why you don't call the F.B.l. for help?

01:18:20.714 --> 01:18:22.705
The F.B.l.'s
looking for me too.

01:18:22.794 --> 01:18:24.432
Oh, great.

01:18:24.474 --> 01:18:28.706
So, how does this work? You murder me
now or you wait till l'm asleep?

01:18:31.154 --> 01:18:33.509
Simon needs to get
a little sleep.

01:18:33.554 --> 01:18:38.184
He's been up for a long time,
and you seemed like a nice person.

01:18:39.474 --> 01:18:44.594
Come on, Simon.
l'll show you where your bed is.

01:18:44.674 --> 01:18:46.869
Come on.

01:18:46.954 --> 01:18:49.548
Are you thirsty?

01:18:49.594 --> 01:18:52.631
He gets the guest room.
You get the couch.

01:18:52.714 --> 01:18:54.750
There's food in there.

01:18:54.834 --> 01:18:58.304
The bathroom.
You can wash up after yourself.

01:19:04.074 --> 01:19:06.144
Let's take this off.

01:19:08.514 --> 01:19:11.631
That's good.
Now lie down.

01:19:14.994 --> 01:19:17.508
Okay?

01:19:17.554 --> 01:19:20.068
Let's take these off,
all right?

01:19:20.114 --> 01:19:23.663
One. Two.

01:19:23.754 --> 01:19:26.507
Okay.

01:19:26.554 --> 01:19:28.704
That's good.

01:19:31.154 --> 01:19:33.384
You okay?

01:19:33.434 --> 01:19:35.311
Good night, Simon.

01:19:37.354 --> 01:19:38.992
Look...

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:42.066
l have to be up
in a few hours.

01:19:42.154 --> 01:19:44.827
l have to fly to Des Moines
in the morning.

01:19:44.914 --> 01:19:49.351
lf l don't make a sale there tomorrow,
then l don't pay my rent.

01:19:49.394 --> 01:19:53.353
So, unless there's anything else you
need, l'd like to get some sleep now.

01:19:53.394 --> 01:19:56.943
No, there's nothing else.
Thank you.

01:19:57.034 --> 01:20:00.913
l promise you we'll be out of here
first thing in the morning.

01:20:33.434 --> 01:20:37.222
Leo, you won't believe the morning.
Did l leave my--

01:20:37.314 --> 01:20:39.430
Leo?

01:20:45.034 --> 01:20:47.389
Oh, my God!

01:20:59.954 --> 01:21:03.469
Tom, there's a woman downstairs
asking to see Art Jeffries.

01:21:03.514 --> 01:21:07.143
- Bring her up.
- She won't talk to anyone except Art.

01:21:07.194 --> 01:21:09.105
Do me a favor.

01:21:09.194 --> 01:21:11.867
l haven't
logged it in... yet.

01:21:11.954 --> 01:21:13.785
Good.

01:21:44.314 --> 01:21:47.511
- How ya doin', man?
- Anybody else with you?

01:21:47.594 --> 01:21:50.028
No.

01:21:50.074 --> 01:21:52.542
This is Emily Lang.

01:21:52.594 --> 01:21:55.631
Emily, why don't you have a seat?
Go ahead.

01:22:02.554 --> 01:22:04.510
Are you Art Jeffries?

01:22:04.594 --> 01:22:06.983
Yeah,
l'm Art Jeffries.

01:22:14.834 --> 01:22:17.985
My boyfriend's last will
and testament.

01:22:18.034 --> 01:22:20.423
l worked with him
at N.S.A.

01:22:21.714 --> 01:22:24.433
The other voice
on the line.

01:22:24.474 --> 01:22:27.386
His name was Leo.

01:22:27.474 --> 01:22:29.783
He was gonna mail one letter
to you.

01:22:29.874 --> 01:22:33.310
The other was addressed to
the Senate Oversight Committee.

01:22:33.394 --> 01:22:35.385
The letters are gone.
This is all that's left.

01:22:35.474 --> 01:22:37.590
''lt has come
to my attention...

01:22:37.674 --> 01:22:41.667
''that my section director and
immediate superior, Nicholas Kudrow...

01:22:41.714 --> 01:22:45.707
''was directly involved in the deaths
of Martin and Jenny Lynch...

01:22:47.674 --> 01:22:49.869
''the parents
of Simon Lynch...

01:22:49.954 --> 01:22:53.071
and the death of Dean Crandell,
my colleague and friend.''

01:22:53.114 --> 01:22:57.426
They killed Leo too right after
he wrote that letter.

01:22:57.514 --> 01:23:00.631
l'm sorry.

01:23:00.714 --> 01:23:02.625
l'm sorry.

01:23:07.194 --> 01:23:10.186
Thank you for coming down,
Emily.

01:23:10.234 --> 01:23:12.987
l'm sorry about Leo.

01:23:13.074 --> 01:23:15.349
You said you were gonna be out before
l went to Des Moines...

01:23:15.434 --> 01:23:17.709
where hopefully l was gonna sell
enough shoes to make the rent.

01:23:17.794 --> 01:23:21.343
Only l didn't go to Des Moines
and l didn't make the rent
because you had an emergency.

01:23:21.394 --> 01:23:23.305
lt was an emergency.

01:23:23.354 --> 01:23:25.743
Maybe you're one of those guys
that has constant emergencies.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:29.668
Everything has to be about excitement.
There are guys like that.

01:23:29.714 --> 01:23:33.468
Yes, l know, but l don't happen
to be one of them.

01:23:33.554 --> 01:23:37.706
Listen to me. Look at me!
This is not about me.

01:23:37.754 --> 01:23:40.587
lt's about that little boy.
And he needs some help.

01:23:40.634 --> 01:23:43.387
As far as l can tell,
you are a decent, caring person.

01:23:43.474 --> 01:23:48.070
l promise you we will be out
of your life as soon as possible. Okay?

01:23:48.114 --> 01:23:50.992
Look, if for some reason
there is an emergency--

01:23:51.034 --> 01:23:53.867
- Oh! You mean a different emergency!
- Yes, a different emergency.

01:23:53.954 --> 01:23:58.072
Do not call the police, okay?
You call this guy. He's with the F.B.l.

01:23:58.154 --> 01:24:01.066
l call the F.B.l.,
not the police?

01:24:01.154 --> 01:24:04.112
- Right. The police can't protect Simon.
- Right.

01:24:04.154 --> 01:24:06.543
Look.

01:24:06.634 --> 01:24:09.865
Simon is only in danger
if they know where he is.

01:24:09.914 --> 01:24:14.988
They don't know where he is,
so he's not in danger, so you're
not in danger. All right?

01:24:15.034 --> 01:24:18.265
Right. Unless
there's an emergency.

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:25.153
- lt's good to see you're keeping
your sense of humor about this.
- Yeah.

01:24:25.234 --> 01:24:30.183
l promise you l will be back in this
apartment at 2:00 tomorrow afternoon.

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:34.347
And l don't know how yet,
but l will make this up to you.

01:24:34.434 --> 01:24:36.504
Okay?
Thank you.

01:24:36.594 --> 01:24:39.313
Take care.

01:24:50.194 --> 01:24:54.551
l don't know if it qualifies
as a plan. l'm gonna fly there
and show them Leo's letter.

01:24:54.634 --> 01:24:57.592
Here's the bad news.

01:24:57.674 --> 01:25:01.030
You gotta get Simon into the
Witness Protection Program right away.

01:25:01.074 --> 01:25:04.225
Art, l'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

01:25:04.274 --> 01:25:07.266
How do you expect me to authorize
a move like that?

01:25:07.314 --> 01:25:11.990
Lie, cheat. l don't give a shit. You
don't do it, that kid's as good as dead.

01:25:12.074 --> 01:25:15.430
Has it occurred to you that maybe Kudrow
would shoot you on sight?

01:25:15.474 --> 01:25:17.863
Yeah, that has occurred
to me.

01:25:17.954 --> 01:25:21.344
lf that happens,
you know what to do with these.

01:25:21.394 --> 01:25:24.466
Hope l see you later.

01:25:33.234 --> 01:25:35.509
Sandy!
So glad you could make it.

01:25:35.594 --> 01:25:40.190
Heard Ted had back surgery. Did you have
anything to do with that? Excuse me.

01:25:47.754 --> 01:25:49.585
Can l help you?

01:25:50.674 --> 01:25:52.983
Excuse me.
Nick, my good friend!

01:25:53.074 --> 01:25:56.987
l want you to know that
your Mercury thing is a goddamn triumph.

01:25:57.074 --> 01:25:59.269
- l mean that.
- l appreciate that, Senator.

01:25:59.314 --> 01:26:03.148
A feather in your cap. The Oversight
Committee is singing your praises.

01:26:03.234 --> 01:26:05.623
You're getting a reputation
as the ''can do'' guy.

01:26:05.714 --> 01:26:08.512
- Thank you. l do appreciate that.
- There's a guy outside.

01:26:08.594 --> 01:26:10.425
- Who?
- Says he's with the Bureau.

01:26:10.514 --> 01:26:13.267
Would you excuse me
one moment, please?

01:26:14.994 --> 01:26:17.906
lf he wasn't Bureau,
l wouldn't have bothered you.

01:26:17.994 --> 01:26:20.269
l would've lost him,
but l didn't know, sir.

01:26:20.314 --> 01:26:23.192
No, Ted, you used good judgment.
l'd like to see him.

01:26:23.274 --> 01:26:25.105
He's not
very presentable.

01:26:25.194 --> 01:26:28.391
Bring him in the back way. Take him
to the wine cellar. l'll be down.

01:26:31.394 --> 01:26:34.545
Nick, l can't believe you look so good
for someone so old!

01:26:34.634 --> 01:26:38.183
-How do you do that?
-Drugs, my dear. Massive doses of drugs.

01:26:38.234 --> 01:26:42.273
Please don't handle
the wine, Mr. Jeffries.

01:26:42.354 --> 01:26:45.710
Yes, l've read
your file.

01:26:47.514 --> 01:26:50.233
A deeply troubled F.B.l. agent
with a lousy record...

01:26:50.314 --> 01:26:52.225
kidnaps
a nine-year-old boy.

01:26:52.274 --> 01:26:54.230
Nice goin'.

01:26:54.314 --> 01:26:58.785
You come to my home in the middle
of a social function carrying a gun...

01:26:58.834 --> 01:27:02.270
to confront me with this fabricated
unsigned accusation...

01:27:02.354 --> 01:27:04.265
allegedly written
by Leo Pedranski...

01:27:04.314 --> 01:27:07.784
who was killed the day before yesterday
by you, for all l know.

01:27:07.834 --> 01:27:11.509
What do you want from me?
l'd like to get back to my guests.

01:27:11.594 --> 01:27:16.110
Unsigned accusation
was typed on carbon paper.

01:27:16.154 --> 01:27:18.224
Who uses that anymore?

01:27:18.314 --> 01:27:21.386
The late Leo Pedranski's
fingerprints were all over it.

01:27:23.634 --> 01:27:26.102
The Pomerello's
a little corky.

01:27:26.194 --> 01:27:30.312
l'm sure the Senate Oversight
Committee won't have any problem
connecting you to the murder.

01:27:30.354 --> 01:27:35.109
But you haven't given the carbon
to the Senate Oversight Committee.

01:27:35.154 --> 01:27:38.112
lf you had, you wouldn't
be here right now.

01:27:38.194 --> 01:27:40.992
You've got your precious
carbon tucked away...

01:27:41.074 --> 01:27:43.463
guaranteeing your safety,
etcetera, etcetera...

01:27:43.554 --> 01:27:45.385
so you can come here
and demand what?

01:27:45.514 --> 01:27:48.551
Untold millions
in unmarked bills?

01:27:48.594 --> 01:27:51.791
l asked you
not to handle the wine, please.

01:27:51.834 --> 01:27:55.907
You know, it's good to see you got
your priorities in order.

01:27:57.874 --> 01:27:59.751
That's better.

01:27:59.794 --> 01:28:02.627
You're not worried about
murdering a nine-year-old boy...

01:28:02.674 --> 01:28:04.665
but you're worried about
this fucking wine?

01:28:04.754 --> 01:28:08.303
Here's the deal.

01:28:08.394 --> 01:28:11.431
l don't give the Senate
Oversight Committee the carbon.

01:28:11.474 --> 01:28:14.705
They don't waste three years with their
investigation, wailing and moaning...

01:28:14.794 --> 01:28:17.024
''How could this happen
in America?''...

01:28:17.074 --> 01:28:19.907
while you have one of
your spooks whack Simon Lynch.

01:28:19.954 --> 01:28:22.070
Or?

01:28:22.154 --> 01:28:25.430
Or you do the only thing that'll
guarantee Simon Lynch his safety.

01:28:25.514 --> 01:28:29.143
You or one of your superiors or
the president of the United States...

01:28:29.234 --> 01:28:31.225
l don't give a fuck who...

01:28:31.314 --> 01:28:33.953
but someone is gonna go on
national television and tell America...

01:28:34.034 --> 01:28:37.026
that your billion dollar,
uncrackable code...

01:28:37.074 --> 01:28:39.793
has been cracked by
a nine-year-old autistic boy.

01:28:39.834 --> 01:28:41.825
Then you get
your carbon back.

01:28:46.994 --> 01:28:50.111
You know what l think,
Mr. Jeffries?

01:28:50.194 --> 01:28:54.585
l think you've seen too many of those
four-wheel drive commercials on TV.

01:28:56.754 --> 01:28:59.473
The ones where you get to drive fast
and be a renegade.

01:28:59.514 --> 01:29:02.233
Let's talk about
the real world...

01:29:02.314 --> 01:29:06.705
where you're not some wonderful lone
wolf hero, but you're part of a team.

01:29:06.794 --> 01:29:10.673
And you play your position
because that's what America is.

01:29:10.754 --> 01:29:13.393
lt's one big team.

01:29:13.434 --> 01:29:18.554
This might be difficult
for you to grasp, but l am a patriot.

01:29:18.634 --> 01:29:22.673
And a patriot is one who makes
the right moral choice.

01:29:22.714 --> 01:29:26.229
Sometimes it takes a strong man
to make that choice.

01:29:26.314 --> 01:29:31.183
One boy who cannot survive on his own,
one of nature's mistakes...

01:29:31.274 --> 01:29:34.505
weighed against the lives
of thousands of our people.

01:29:34.594 --> 01:29:37.062
Think about it.
You worked undercover.

01:29:37.154 --> 01:29:40.703
How many of our agents will
be put in harm's way
if this code is compromised?

01:29:40.754 --> 01:29:42.790
Members of your team.

01:29:42.834 --> 01:29:45.428
Men like Rasheed Halabi...

01:29:45.514 --> 01:29:48.711
an lraqi-American
and a great patriot.

01:29:48.754 --> 01:29:52.542
A man, who as we speak, is undercover
in Saddam's Republican Guard.

01:29:52.594 --> 01:29:55.506
A man who has not seen
his family--

01:29:57.554 --> 01:30:00.546
That's for Simon's parents,
you piece of shit.

01:30:02.234 --> 01:30:04.145
You got 36 hours.

01:30:04.234 --> 01:30:07.988
Should be enough time to get your
undercover people out of harm's way.

01:30:10.674 --> 01:30:14.587
Oh, by the way.
Happy birthday, Nick.

01:30:26.194 --> 01:30:29.550
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

01:30:30.554 --> 01:30:32.431
Yeah.
You all right?

01:30:32.474 --> 01:30:35.546
Yeah, l'm all right. How'd it go
with the witness protection thing?

01:30:35.634 --> 01:30:38.512
Everything's set.
Tomorrow night, 8:15...

01:30:38.594 --> 01:30:40.505
U.S. marshalls are gonna meet us
with a chopper...

01:30:40.594 --> 01:30:43.427
at the heliport on top
of the G.E.X. building.

01:30:43.474 --> 01:30:45.465
l took your advice.
l lied.

01:30:45.554 --> 01:30:48.671
All right. Good.
See you then. Bye.

01:30:50.674 --> 01:30:53.108
That was recorded
on passive V.O.X...

01:30:53.194 --> 01:30:56.186
at Agent Jordan's
residence at 11:58 p.m.

01:30:56.274 --> 01:30:59.152
As to the pickup, since we can assume
the boy will not be alone...

01:30:59.194 --> 01:31:03.107
l suggest we wait until
we get him on the chopper.

01:31:03.554 --> 01:31:05.704
Saw them do this in the movies.

01:31:07.914 --> 01:31:10.667
How are you, laddie boy?

01:31:17.314 --> 01:31:19.305
Oh, damn!

01:31:19.354 --> 01:31:22.744
Simon, turn it down, please!

01:31:22.834 --> 01:31:24.870
Hello?

01:31:24.914 --> 01:31:27.064
Hello?

01:31:28.114 --> 01:31:30.469
Hello?

01:31:40.154 --> 01:31:42.065
How much l owe you?

01:31:42.154 --> 01:31:44.588
- Twenty dollars, sir.
- Here. Thanks a lot.

01:31:52.594 --> 01:31:54.471
Stacey?

01:31:57.394 --> 01:31:59.385
Stacey?

01:32:03.754 --> 01:32:05.665
Shit!

01:32:15.474 --> 01:32:19.706
- Hello?
- Tommy, where are they now?

01:32:19.794 --> 01:32:22.149
Relax. Simon and the girl
are fine. l talked to 'em.

01:32:22.194 --> 01:32:24.105
She said she got spooked.
Someone called.

01:32:24.194 --> 01:32:28.426
- When she picked up the phone
the line was dead.
- lt was me from the airplane.

01:32:28.474 --> 01:32:32.831
- Told 'em when Witness Protection
is gonna pick 'em up?
- Absolutely.

01:32:32.914 --> 01:32:35.189
She's gonna meet us there.
Everything's set.

01:32:35.274 --> 01:32:37.788
Listen, l gotta go.

01:32:41.114 --> 01:32:42.991
Agent Jordan.

01:32:43.074 --> 01:32:46.987
Lieutenant Colonel Kudrow
of the N.S.A.

01:32:47.034 --> 01:32:49.502
What am l looking at here,
Tommy?

01:32:49.554 --> 01:32:52.751
You forged documents to obtain witness
protection under false pretenses.

01:32:52.834 --> 01:32:57.988
Don't listen to anything this guy
tells you. This guy is dangerous.

01:32:58.034 --> 01:33:00.070
Tommy, sit down,
and don't speak.

01:33:07.794 --> 01:33:10.103
Agent Jordan...

01:33:10.194 --> 01:33:12.549
regardless of what
you think of me...

01:33:12.594 --> 01:33:15.472
l only want to resolve
this situation to rescue a young boy...

01:33:15.514 --> 01:33:17.982
from a delusional kidnapper.

01:33:18.034 --> 01:33:20.673
We will proceed
with the pickup as planned.

01:33:20.754 --> 01:33:23.473
As of this moment,
the F.B.l. will stand down...

01:33:23.554 --> 01:33:26.944
and the N.S.A.
will take over from here.

01:33:26.994 --> 01:33:29.064
Gentlemen.

01:33:36.434 --> 01:33:38.868
- Chief, take a look at this.
- l'm not taking a look.

01:33:38.954 --> 01:33:43.744
You have to look at this! Leo Pedranski
worked for Kudrow. He wrote that letter.

01:33:43.794 --> 01:33:46.069
He was also killed
after he wrote it.

01:33:46.154 --> 01:33:49.430
l ran it through the lab.
And the fingerprints on it
are an exact match for his.

01:33:59.954 --> 01:34:01.865
Up.

01:34:01.954 --> 01:34:04.787
That's where we're goin',
Simon.

01:34:06.954 --> 01:34:08.785
Come on.

01:34:34.994 --> 01:34:37.713
ls that you, Art?

01:34:40.114 --> 01:34:43.550
l'm a United States marshall
with the Witness Protection Program.

01:34:44.714 --> 01:34:47.512
How do you do?

01:34:47.594 --> 01:34:49.824
Good.

01:34:52.514 --> 01:34:54.425
You must be Simon.

01:34:54.514 --> 01:34:57.233
Chopper on approach, sir.

01:34:57.314 --> 01:34:59.782
Why don't you come
with me, son?

01:34:59.834 --> 01:35:02.348
- No!
- He doesn't like
to be touched by strangers.

01:35:02.394 --> 01:35:05.386
l'll take him.

01:35:05.434 --> 01:35:08.744
Come on, Simon.
Let's go see the helicopter.

01:35:10.794 --> 01:35:14.343
- l thought Art was supposed
to meet us here.
- There's been a change in plans.

01:35:14.394 --> 01:35:17.670
But l want to assure you
that your country owes you
the greatest debt of gratitude.

01:35:17.714 --> 01:35:20.990
Chopper coming in!
Don't have much time!

01:35:22.834 --> 01:35:26.543
For the safety of the boy, you should
go home now and forget you were here.

01:35:29.554 --> 01:35:32.864
Okay, Simon, you're gonna go for a ride
in the helicopter.

01:35:32.914 --> 01:35:34.791
Good-bye, Simon.

01:35:36.754 --> 01:35:38.790
You can go with him.

01:35:58.674 --> 01:36:00.505
Tommy.

01:36:00.594 --> 01:36:03.108
They're on the helipad,
and the chopper's coming in.

01:36:03.154 --> 01:36:05.031
You have a green light.
Go, go, go, go!

01:36:05.074 --> 01:36:06.871
- lt's a go. Let's move.
- Go, go!

01:36:10.834 --> 01:36:12.392
Hold them back!

01:36:18.674 --> 01:36:21.063
Stay down!
Stay down!

01:36:30.874 --> 01:36:34.310
No! No!

01:36:37.634 --> 01:36:39.909
No!

01:37:09.594 --> 01:37:11.505
No! No! Simon!

01:37:34.234 --> 01:37:37.624
Let me go. Come on!

01:37:37.714 --> 01:37:42.185
No! No!
No, Simon, no!

01:38:05.834 --> 01:38:08.906
Get up. Get up, get up.

01:38:08.954 --> 01:38:11.024
That's right.

01:38:37.754 --> 01:38:40.063
- Tommy, no! Hold 'em back!
- Hold your fire!

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:43.390
Keep 'em back now!

01:38:44.474 --> 01:38:47.591
No!

01:39:18.634 --> 01:39:20.465
Where's the team leader?

01:39:20.554 --> 01:39:25.150
- Right here, Agent Jeffries.
- lt's Kudrow's piece. l got a
nine-millimeter on the sidewalk.

01:39:25.234 --> 01:39:27.065
l'll take care of it.

01:40:02.354 --> 01:40:07.030
Let's see what you got.

01:40:07.114 --> 01:40:09.070
- l want you to say ''bug.''
- Bug.

01:40:09.114 --> 01:40:12.948
Can you look at me?
Bug.

01:40:13.034 --> 01:40:14.945
- Bug.
- That's very good.

01:40:14.994 --> 01:40:17.110
l like that very much.

01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:25.345
Can l help you?

01:40:25.394 --> 01:40:28.545
l'm Art Jeffries,
a friend of Simon Lynch.

01:40:28.594 --> 01:40:32.507
Yes, l know. His foster parents
told me all about you.

01:40:32.594 --> 01:40:34.425
How's he doing?

01:40:34.514 --> 01:40:38.712
He's fine.
He's adjusted very well.

01:40:39.754 --> 01:40:41.710
Do you want
to say hello?

01:40:41.794 --> 01:40:44.752
He probably wouldn't
remember me.

01:40:44.794 --> 01:40:48.992
l was told...
not to expect too much.

01:40:49.074 --> 01:40:53.113
l brought him some puzzles.
He likes puzzles.

01:40:53.194 --> 01:40:55.344
Do you think you could give
these to him, please?

01:40:55.434 --> 01:40:59.791
Sure, but l think it would
be better for Simon if you did.

01:40:59.834 --> 01:41:01.904
lt's okay.
Come on.

01:41:01.994 --> 01:41:03.825
Thank you.

01:41:14.034 --> 01:41:15.911
Hey, Simon.

01:41:15.954 --> 01:41:18.514
How you doin', partner?

01:41:21.674 --> 01:41:26.304
l brought you some new puzzles.
You might like those.

01:41:30.194 --> 01:41:32.389
Hey, Simon, look at me.

01:41:34.994 --> 01:41:38.111
Look at me, Simon.
Look in my eyes.

01:41:39.154 --> 01:41:41.588
Look in my eyes.

01:41:45.154 --> 01:41:47.384
lt's me, Art.
