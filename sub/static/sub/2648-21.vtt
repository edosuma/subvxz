00:03.424 --> 00:05.549
Okay. Okay, here she comes.

00:06.762 --> 00:09.799
Happy Mother's Day! Aah!

00:09.891 --> 00:11.849
- What are you wearing?
- You don't remember this shirt?

00:11.936 --> 00:15.187
You made it for me for Mother's Day
in kindergarten. It's adorable.

00:15.273 --> 00:18.856
It's perverted. It looks like you were felt
up by the creepy guy around the corner.

00:18.944 --> 00:21.863
- Ew! Why him?
- Because he's got freakishly tiny hands.

00:21.949 --> 00:24.654
- Thank you.
- I cannot believe you kept that shirt.

00:24.744 --> 00:26.702
Of course I kept it. I'm your mother.

00:26.789 --> 00:28.995
I keep everything you make me.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.538
- Please take that off.
Oh, when I'm dead.

00:31.627 --> 00:35.294
Today is my special day,
and I am gonna enjoy me some coffee.

00:35.382 --> 00:37.292
You know that's a pencil holder, right?

00:37.386 --> 00:38.796
I do now.

00:40.223 --> 00:42.299
Go first.
- No, you can go first.

00:42.391 --> 00:44.301
- Manny, go first.
- No, Jay, you go first.

00:44.395 --> 00:46.601
Somebody give me a present.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.353
Oh, Jay! A diamond necklace.

00:50.444 --> 00:51.939
Thank you.

00:52.028 --> 00:53.689
You deserve it.

00:53.781 --> 00:55.407
Go ahead, kid.

00:55.492 --> 00:58.066
- Happy Mother's Day, Mom.
- Ah!

00:58.163 --> 01:03.704
A necklace made
of the Froot Loops. I love it.

01:03.793 --> 01:06.748
I know they're not
exactly diamonds, Mom.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.749
No, they're beautiful.

01:08.843 --> 01:11.594
You know what? I got a confession
to make. Those aren't real diamonds.

01:11.679 --> 01:14.930
No. Give them back.
I'll get you some real ones later.

01:15.017 --> 01:17.590
Dang it. Now I got to come clean.

01:17.687 --> 01:20.356
Those aren't real Froot Loops.
They're generic.

01:20.441 --> 01:21.816
I...

01:23.235 --> 01:25.561
Now I have no presents again.

01:30.079 --> 01:32.036
Good morning!

01:32.121 --> 01:34.827
Hey! Hey, what's this?

01:34.918 --> 01:36.910
Well, I know you've had
some late nights with Lily...

01:37.004 --> 01:39.494
and this is just my way
of saying thank you and I love you.

01:39.589 --> 01:41.132
Oh! Thank <i>you.</i>

01:41.218 --> 01:44.220
And this is just the beginning.
Today is your day.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.805
- Today?
- Yeah. All day.

01:46.891 --> 01:50.226
Today? Today's my day?

01:50.313 --> 01:52.436
- Something's happening.
- It's Mother's Day, Mitchell.

01:52.523 --> 01:53.722
So?

01:53.818 --> 01:56.356
You're bringing me breakfast in bed
on Mother's Day.

01:56.445 --> 01:59.446
This is not a Mother's Day breakfast.
This is a breakfast that happens to be...

01:59.533 --> 02:01.739
You think of me as Lily's mother.

02:01.828 --> 02:04.829
- I'm your wife. I'm a woman.
- What?

02:04.915 --> 02:08.283
Honestly, I'm a little offended
that he accused me of that.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.997
I'm actually very sensitive to that issue.

02:11.089 --> 02:15.088
Like I would ever treat
my partner as a woman. I...

02:15.177 --> 02:16.671
Somebody got new curtains.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.756
Well, Mrs. Pritchett loves to shop.

02:18.850 --> 02:21.221
Oh! We're never gonna be done by 6:00.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.935
I better call home.

02:23.020 --> 02:25.976
The wife's not gonna like this.

02:26.067 --> 02:29.686
Sometimes I think
he just wants to be mad at me.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.688
- I can't eat.
- Okay, you know what?

02:31.782 --> 02:34.867
If you can't accept the nice gesture,
then just forget it.

02:34.953 --> 02:37.908
Okay, scratch the balloons.
She is in a mood.

02:40.543 --> 02:42.370
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

02:42.463 --> 02:44.502
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

02:44.590 --> 02:46.549
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

02:46.634 --> 02:48.544
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

02:48.637 --> 02:49.799
<i># Hey ##</i>

02:52.309 --> 02:54.432
I asked Claire what she wanted
for Mother's Day...

02:54.520 --> 02:56.513
and she said, "Take a hike."

02:56.605 --> 02:58.848
It's not like that.

02:58.942 --> 03:01.517
She's just bananas
for walking around in nature.

03:01.612 --> 03:05.563
So she and Gloria are taking
the kids up the canyon...

03:05.659 --> 03:10.239
and Jay and I are throwing on the aprons
and preparing a Mother's Day feast.

03:10.332 --> 03:12.040
It's...

03:12.126 --> 03:14.334
It's gonna be fun.

03:17.299 --> 03:19.375
- <i>##  </i>

03:19.469 --> 03:21.795
# I know you wanna leave me #

03:21.888 --> 03:23.382
- # But I refuse to... #

03:23.474 --> 03:25.846
- <i>##  </i>
- We're not doing that.

03:25.938 --> 03:29.013
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

03:33.569 --> 03:35.563
There are coyotes in these woods.

03:35.657 --> 03:38.325
- Did you pack a weapon?
- I have a walking stick.

03:38.409 --> 03:42.158
- Does it become a sword?
- I guess it can become a running stick.

03:42.247 --> 03:44.122
You're gonna outrun a coyote?

03:44.208 --> 03:46.333
The fastest mammal in the world.

03:46.419 --> 03:48.496
I'm not sure that's true.

03:48.589 --> 03:51.460
And how are you gonna fend 'em off
with a Popsicle stick?

03:51.551 --> 03:54.589
It's a spear,
and it smells like lemon lime...

03:54.681 --> 03:56.473
a flavor coyotes hate.

03:56.558 --> 03:59.428
- Where are you getting your information?
- How much farther?

03:59.520 --> 04:02.771
I'd like to go far enough that we can't
still see our car in the parking lot.

04:02.857 --> 04:05.184
- I'm getting dust in my mouth.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.603
- You have to appreciate nature.
- Yes.

04:07.697 --> 04:09.655
Soon this will be the mall.

04:09.740 --> 04:11.781
- I'll come then.
- I'm hungry.

04:11.870 --> 04:13.779
I say we eat what we kill.

04:13.871 --> 04:16.541
Oh, then I guess
we'll be eating the mood.

04:16.625 --> 04:18.168
I don't get you at all.

04:18.253 --> 04:19.712
I know.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.874
Oh, is that the party over there?

04:22.966 --> 04:25.339
I don't know. I'm a woman, remember?
I have a terrible sense of direction.

04:25.428 --> 04:28.465
May I remind you that my big crime
was making you fluffy pancakes.

04:28.557 --> 04:31.095
I'm getting a little sick
of you dwelling on this.

04:31.186 --> 04:33.973
It happens to be Mother's Day,
not Martyr's Day.

04:34.063 --> 04:36.438
Mitchell, I'm sorry.

04:36.525 --> 04:39.528
- It's just a sensitive issue for me.
- Okay.

04:39.613 --> 04:43.065
- There's nothing gays hate more than when people...
Treat us like women.

04:43.159 --> 04:46.114
We're not.
We don't want to go to your baby shower.

04:46.206 --> 04:48.198
We don't have a time of the month.

04:48.290 --> 04:50.581
- We don't love pink.
- You love pink.

04:50.668 --> 04:53.422
- No, pink loves me.
- Okay, well...

04:53.506 --> 04:55.463
- Hey, guys!
- Hey!

04:55.549 --> 04:58.588
- So? - That's Jen, husband Rick, baby Diego.
I don't get it either.

04:58.679 --> 05:01.431
- Hey, Jen, let me help you with that.
- Ah.

05:01.517 --> 05:04.471
Rick, how you doing?

05:04.562 --> 05:07.019
We should do play group
on weekends more often.

05:07.106 --> 05:09.644
It's nice to have
the husbands around to help, right?

05:09.735 --> 05:12.523
Oh, yeah, because that makes all the
sense in the world... you as the husband.

05:12.614 --> 05:15.449
- That's not what she meant.
- Look at us. I could snap you like a twig.

05:15.534 --> 05:17.527
Every once in a while,
you say that thing about the twig...

05:17.621 --> 05:19.614
- and I need you to know that it bothers me.
- Sorry.

05:19.705 --> 05:22.377
Okay, everybody. Happy Mother's Day.

05:22.459 --> 05:24.085
I know I speak for all the guys...

05:24.171 --> 05:27.506
when I say thank you for everything
you do while we're off having affairs.

05:27.592 --> 05:30.129
- I'm kidding. I'll pay for that later.

05:30.220 --> 05:32.628
Let's get the moms and kids
together for a picture.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.717
- Let's get out of here. Leave the stroller and run.
- Cam, stop.

05:34.809 --> 05:37.679
- No one's going to ask you to...
Cameron, get on up here!

05:37.770 --> 05:39.728
I don't know.
You guys just go ahead there.

05:39.816 --> 05:42.852
- You're an honorary mom. Come on.
I don't know.

05:42.945 --> 05:46.396
- Okay, all right. Unhand me.
- Get over there.

05:48.076 --> 05:51.279
Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, tighten up. Tighten up.

05:51.372 --> 05:53.828
- Up here, ladies.

05:53.917 --> 05:55.625
Beautiful. One more, gals.

05:55.711 --> 05:58.416
- Oh, thanks, ladies. Thanks so much. Perfect.

05:58.505 --> 06:00.499
Great. Okay.

06:02.260 --> 06:06.308
Yeah, that was definitely poison oak.
I think this rash is spreading.

06:06.392 --> 06:09.178
<i>Ay,</i> Manny, that's not a rash.
It's red because you scratch it.

06:09.270 --> 06:11.263
I just don't want my throat to close.

06:11.355 --> 06:13.017
Wouldn't be the worst thing.

06:13.108 --> 06:14.899
I'm so bored, I'd rather be reading.

06:14.986 --> 06:17.905
I'm so bored, I chewed the last bug that
flew in my mouth just to feel something.

06:17.989 --> 06:19.898
I'm so bored, I'm talking to you.

06:19.991 --> 06:21.367
Okay.

06:21.452 --> 06:24.703
For the last 20 minutes,
all you people have done is whine.

06:24.789 --> 06:27.708
You would think on Mother's Day, at least,
you would have something nice...

06:27.793 --> 06:29.252
Shh!
- What?

06:30.632 --> 06:33.169
Thought I heard a coyote. Go ahead.

06:34.302 --> 06:35.927
God, Luke, you're such an idiot.

06:36.013 --> 06:38.137
At least I don't look like an idiot.

06:38.224 --> 06:40.216
- What does that mean?
- Your hat.

06:40.310 --> 06:42.719
It looks like you walked under a bird
that poops ugly hats.

06:42.813 --> 06:45.305
- Can we watch the language?
- There's nothing else to watch.

06:45.399 --> 06:46.942
Enough complaining!

06:47.026 --> 06:50.645
You can't bitch all day
because you're not at the beach all day!

06:50.740 --> 06:52.199
Come on.

06:52.283 --> 06:56.152
No. No, no. L... I'm giving myself
a Mother's Day present.

06:56.248 --> 06:57.990
Kids, your hike is over.

06:58.082 --> 06:59.246
- Yes!
- Yeah!
- All right!

06:59.335 --> 07:01.660
No. No, not happy. Bad.

07:01.753 --> 07:03.129
- Hmm.
- Sad.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.372
Gloria and I are gonna go finish
this beautiful hike together...

07:05.466 --> 07:10.427
while you sit here and think about
how selfish and thoughtless you've been.

07:10.516 --> 07:11.713
Come on.

07:11.809 --> 07:14.099
If we're thoughtless, how can we think?

07:17.232 --> 07:19.475
You just lost your water.

07:19.568 --> 07:21.646
Let's go.

07:34.463 --> 07:36.788
- What the hell are those?
- Onion goggles.

07:36.883 --> 07:41.047
No more tears when I cook.
Welcome to the 21 st century. You should get a pair.

07:41.138 --> 07:43.131
I was gonna suggest the same thing.

07:43.224 --> 07:45.300
Hey, Jay, you know
what we should put in this?

07:45.394 --> 07:48.229
- We should add a...
- No. It's my mom's recipe.

07:48.315 --> 07:51.980
Whatever it says on the page goes
in the pot. Nothing more, nothing less.

07:52.069 --> 07:55.938
Now, how long do I stir
the beef and sausages? Read it to me.

07:56.033 --> 07:58.525
"We should stir the beef
and sausages for five minutes."

07:58.619 --> 08:01.656
And how much longer do I have to listen
to the Julia Child impression?

08:01.749 --> 08:03.622
For as long as it's still funny.

08:03.709 --> 08:06.166
I think the timer just went off on that.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.330
That was unnecessary.

08:09.966 --> 08:12.209
What's this? What?

08:12.303 --> 08:16.682
Hey, Jay, maybe after this,
we should make the perfect mom.

08:16.768 --> 08:20.267
All we need is a tablespoon of love,
one cup of warmth.

08:20.356 --> 08:23.441
- Add one heart, softened.
- What the hell are you talking about?

08:23.527 --> 08:28.355
This recipe for the perfect mom,
by Jay Francis Pritchett, age nine.

08:29.825 --> 08:31.818
Geez, I forgot all about that.

08:33.078 --> 08:35.037
I didn't know she had that in there.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.746
- What's that, Francis?
- Nothing.

08:37.835 --> 08:40.374
- How much longer on the meat?
- Ohh.

08:40.465 --> 08:44.379
I love this part about
"serves one small boy." It's adorable.

08:45.929 --> 08:49.549
Wow. A hundred and seventy five pounds
of tenderness.

08:49.643 --> 08:52.313
She must have loved that. Big woman?

08:55.150 --> 08:56.312
Jay?

08:56.402 --> 08:58.311
And that's when I saw it.

08:58.404 --> 08:59.946
Jay?

09:00.657 --> 09:02.485
Are...

09:02.577 --> 09:06.077
- Are you crying?
- No. It's the onions, damn it. Give me these.

09:08.959 --> 09:11.997
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

09:12.089 --> 09:14.497
Those really frame your face.

09:20.515 --> 09:23.803
Oh! Wow! Beautiful.

09:23.895 --> 09:25.723
<i>Ay,</i> thank you.

09:27.483 --> 09:31.862
Okay, I don't want you to judge me,
but I have to say something.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.438
Sometimes I wanna punch my kids.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.491
- You don't mean that.
- No, I do. I do.

09:36.578 --> 09:38.571
The last time they were horrible
the way they were today...

09:38.664 --> 09:40.573
they happened to be all lined up...

09:40.666 --> 09:43.539
and I couldn't help
but think if I hit just one of 'em...

09:43.630 --> 09:45.586
the rest would go down like dominoes.

09:45.672 --> 09:46.753
- Geez.
- I know.

09:46.841 --> 09:48.253
That would rob me of the pleasure...

09:48.344 --> 09:50.170
of hitting each one individually, but...

09:50.263 --> 09:53.181
Oh, my God. You don't talk
about your children this way.

09:53.265 --> 09:55.473
Oh, come on.
You know Manny irritates you.

09:55.560 --> 09:59.607
No. Manny is the best thing that ever happened to me.
We have a special bond.

09:59.690 --> 10:02.776
Yes. Bonds. I know.
But that's not what I'm talking about now.

10:02.862 --> 10:06.231
Claire, for a long time,
it was only the two of us.

10:06.325 --> 10:08.448
I cannot say anything bad about that boy.

10:08.535 --> 10:09.947
Give me a break.

10:10.038 --> 10:12.956
Gloria, anybody who's ever
had a kid knows...

10:13.042 --> 10:15.877
that they can irritate
the freaking life out of you at some point.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.039
Am I right?

10:18.131 --> 10:20.373
Oh. Okay.

10:22.470 --> 10:24.048
He's persnickety.

10:24.138 --> 10:26.097
- What?
- Manny.

10:26.183 --> 10:28.805
He's persnickety. It drives me up the wall.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.640
Okay. Persnickety. Good start.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.689
- And he follows me around all the time.
- Mm-hmm.

10:32.776 --> 10:35.481
Sometimes I love it,
but sometimes I need my own space.

10:35.570 --> 10:38.656
This does not make you a bad mother
to admit these things...

10:38.740 --> 10:40.900
And the poetry... it's not very good.

10:40.994 --> 10:43.072
- Ha.
- First time that I say that out loud.

10:43.163 --> 10:44.622
- Okay.

10:44.707 --> 10:46.866
- It's not very good!
- Wow.

10:48.420 --> 10:49.832
- I love Manny.
- Right.

10:49.922 --> 10:52.247
But sometimes I... Just be a boy.

10:52.342 --> 10:56.008
- Go outside. Kick a ball. Steal something.
- Oh...

10:56.096 --> 10:58.767
It feels so good.

10:58.850 --> 11:00.346
- Yeah.

11:00.437 --> 11:02.061
Maybe to you.

11:03.982 --> 11:05.642
No, Manny. <i>Ä„Ay!</i>

11:05.735 --> 11:10.694
I was talking about another Manny
that I know long time ago.

11:10.781 --> 11:12.112
<i>Diablo.</i>

11:12.200 --> 11:13.945
Manny!

11:15.623 --> 11:18.992
You know, more people have died hiking
than in the entire Civil War.

11:19.084 --> 11:21.077
Okay, what book did you read that in?

11:21.170 --> 11:24.126
Book? Wake up and smell
the Internet, grandma.

11:24.216 --> 11:26.589
You know Mom's just gonna
want us to apologize.

11:26.677 --> 11:29.301
Well, we did kind of ruin
her Mother's Day.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.548
No. She ruined her Mother's Day.

11:31.643 --> 11:33.767
She took us to a place
she knew we wouldn't like...

11:33.854 --> 11:36.559
and then we complained for, like,
a second and we're the bad guys?

11:36.650 --> 11:40.399
That's a good point. You ever get the
feeling she does this intentionally?

11:40.487 --> 11:43.109
- Why would she do that?
- So she can make us feel guilty.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.533
Exactly. And the next time we're choosing
what to do, she gets her way again.

11:46.620 --> 11:48.197
And the next time and the next time...

11:48.288 --> 11:50.330
and eventually
it's Mother's Day every day.

11:50.417 --> 11:52.208
Wow. Mom's really smart.

11:52.293 --> 11:54.288
- Well, not smarter than me.
- Well...

11:54.381 --> 11:56.670
I say we don't apologize this time.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.668
Let her know we're onto her little game.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.133
We could change the way
this whole family operates.

12:01.223 --> 12:03.630
Okay, so nobody says they're sorry.
Got it?

12:03.725 --> 12:05.765
Keep your mouth shut
when she comes back.

12:06.354 --> 12:08.182
If she comes back.

12:09.107 --> 12:11.599
Jay teared up in front of me.

12:11.694 --> 12:15.479
He'd never shown me that kind of
vulnerability, and it embarrassed him.

12:16.617 --> 12:18.657
I'd shamed the proud lion.

12:19.245 --> 12:20.739
Only thing to do...

12:22.417 --> 12:24.409
<i>hug the proud lion.</i>

12:28.842 --> 12:30.964
<i>Oh, I could get bit.</i>

12:31.051 --> 12:33.378
<i>I could get scratched.</i>

12:33.472 --> 12:36.841
<i>But you know what's inside every lion?
</i> <i>A pussycat.</i>

12:36.935 --> 12:39.509
- I need you to get away from me.
- Yeah.

12:42.775 --> 12:46.146
Okay, I'm just gonna say this one time
so we can move on.

12:46.238 --> 12:48.527
- It's okay.
- Gotcha.

12:49.243 --> 12:51.781
You know what "it" is?

12:51.871 --> 12:53.829
- It's you crying.
- Which I didn't.

12:53.915 --> 12:56.751
- You teared up.
- It was the onions.

12:56.836 --> 12:58.461
Okay. Okay.

12:58.546 --> 13:01.501
Maybe, um... Maybe I'm just
putting myself in your place.

13:01.592 --> 13:06.054
But if I came across something from my
childhood and it reminded me of my mom...

13:06.138 --> 13:10.305
I might get a little misty,
maybe even wanna talk about it.

13:10.394 --> 13:11.888
Here.

13:25.122 --> 13:26.700
So proud.

13:26.791 --> 13:26.873
They offered me a bouquet, Mitchell.

13:26.873 --> 13:29.200
They offered me a bouquet, Mitchell.

13:29.293 --> 13:30.871
Which you accepted.

13:30.963 --> 13:33.370
Why can't you ever take my side?

13:33.466 --> 13:35.459
They think of me as a woman.

13:35.552 --> 13:37.877
Cam, no. We're just a new type of family.

13:37.973 --> 13:40.973
They don't have
the right vocabulary for us yet.

13:41.059 --> 13:43.052
They need one of us to be the mom.

13:43.144 --> 13:45.471
So why does it have to be me?
Do I wear a dress?

13:45.565 --> 13:47.356
- Well...
- That's a nightshirt.

13:47.441 --> 13:48.938
It's kind of satiny.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.399
- What are you saying?
- Come on, you know.

13:51.489 --> 13:53.945
No. No, no. No, no. I don't know.

13:54.034 --> 13:57.036
All right, if I'm thinking about it...

13:57.122 --> 13:59.792
Of the two of us, if I had to pick...

13:59.874 --> 14:03.245
I-I might say that you're slightly mom-er.

14:05.090 --> 14:07.380
Excuse me. Can you throw that ball?

14:07.467 --> 14:09.425
- Can I throw a ball?

14:09.512 --> 14:12.050
- You don't... You don't think I can throw a ball?
- Cam...

14:12.141 --> 14:13.599
- No, no.
- That's not what he said.

14:13.685 --> 14:17.268
Apparently, this gentleman
doesn't think I can throw a ball.

14:17.355 --> 14:20.524
- Well, that's not what he said.
- You don't think I can throw a ball? Well, let's find out.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.568
Oh, God, he looks old.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.280
- Oh! Oh, sorry!
- Cam... Hands.

14:27.368 --> 14:28.745
Sorry!

14:28.828 --> 14:30.323
There you go.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.956
<i>Ay,</i> Manny, I didn't mean any of it.

14:36.047 --> 14:37.791
Please, forgive me.

14:37.883 --> 14:40.456
I don't think I can.
Let's just get in the van.

14:40.552 --> 14:43.471
Oh. Sorry for the rhyme.
I know how you hate my poetry.

14:43.555 --> 14:45.348
Please, stop my suffering.

14:45.434 --> 14:47.426
Say something terrible about me...

14:47.518 --> 14:49.727
so that we can be even like a Steven.

14:49.814 --> 14:51.974
Why would I say something terrible
to someone I love?

14:52.067 --> 14:54.273
I curse my tongue!

14:54.361 --> 14:56.154
I'm gonna intervene here.

14:56.239 --> 14:58.481
Manny, let's talk
about what really happened.

14:58.576 --> 15:00.818
Your mom said you should go out
and throw a ball around.

15:00.911 --> 15:03.404
- That can't be the first time you've heard that.
- No.

15:03.498 --> 15:05.825
But there was some hurtful stuff
said about my poetry.

15:05.918 --> 15:07.745
Which your mom regrets.

15:07.836 --> 15:09.167
I do.

15:09.255 --> 15:11.331
So, that's what parents are for.

15:11.424 --> 15:14.841
Sometimes they criticize
because it helps make you stronger.

15:14.929 --> 15:18.050
Kids these days get-get trophies
just for showing up.

15:18.141 --> 15:21.642
What's that gonna lead to?
A bunch of 30-year-olds living at home.

15:21.729 --> 15:24.019
Manny, your mother loves you very much.

15:24.109 --> 15:27.442
She's a human being.
So she let off a little steam.

15:27.529 --> 15:31.196
Honestly, it's probably a great thing
for your relationship.

15:31.284 --> 15:32.827
- I guess I can...
- Stop.

15:32.910 --> 15:35.913
He needs to know the real truth.

15:35.998 --> 15:38.324
Manny, Claire was feeling bad...

15:38.419 --> 15:41.123
because she wants to hit
her own children.

15:41.214 --> 15:46.125
So I tried to make her feel better
by inventing terrible things about you.

15:46.220 --> 15:48.545
You mean, you don't have
a problem with my poetry?

15:48.640 --> 15:53.267
No. The only problem that I have
is that I never have enough of it.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.392
- Mm. Mm.
- You're the perfect kid in every way.

15:57.567 --> 16:01.067
- <i>Ay, mi amor.</i>
- Wow. That's healthy.

16:01.156 --> 16:02.899
Good. You're back.
- Uh-huh.

16:02.991 --> 16:05.862
- Are we done?
- Unless you have something to say...

16:05.953 --> 16:08.196
to the person who gave you life
on her special day.

16:08.289 --> 16:09.570
No.

16:09.666 --> 16:11.160
I'm good.

16:11.835 --> 16:14.506
How about my baby Luke?

16:14.589 --> 16:16.499
Uh...

16:16.592 --> 16:17.921
No.

16:20.764 --> 16:22.259
Hey.
- Hey.

16:22.350 --> 16:23.346
Here.

16:23.434 --> 16:26.055
- What's this?
- It's a Mother's Day card.

16:26.146 --> 16:28.055
And I know... Stop it. Okay...

16:28.149 --> 16:30.355
Cam, that was...
Gloria's card from Manny.

16:30.444 --> 16:33.480
But I just wanted you to see
what its definition for "mother" was on it.

16:33.572 --> 16:36.942
It's "warm," "nurturing
," "supportive." I...

16:37.035 --> 16:39.527
- Maybe when the world sees you...
- Not just the world.

16:39.621 --> 16:41.615
Fine. Fine. Me too.

16:41.708 --> 16:43.666
But maybe this is what we're seeing...

16:43.752 --> 16:46.504
and I don't know
why that's such a bad thing.

16:46.589 --> 16:50.339
It certainly doesn't make you
less of a man. Right?

16:50.426 --> 16:52.467
- Maybe you're right.
- Yeah.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.097
Come on. Let's join the party.

16:54.183 --> 16:56.222
And, Cam, put down the scotch.
You're not fooling anyone.

16:56.309 --> 16:58.137
It is so burn-y. My God.

16:58.229 --> 17:02.063
Come on, people! Everybody to the table!

17:06.614 --> 17:10.992
It's just hard, you know,
having your Mother's Day ruined.

17:13.749 --> 17:16.419
I never thought it would be you, Lucas.

17:22.511 --> 17:24.965
- Don't even think about it.
- But she's sad.

17:25.054 --> 17:26.465
Sad she's losing.

17:26.558 --> 17:29.345
She just hit you with her best shot.
We need to stay strong.

17:29.437 --> 17:30.930
- But I feel...
- Don't feel.

17:31.022 --> 17:33.180
Just go splash water on your face
and man up.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.488
We're your mother now.

17:43.246 --> 17:45.368
How was your day with my dad?

17:45.456 --> 17:47.035
Awkward, actually.

17:47.126 --> 17:49.202
He, um... He cried a little.

17:49.295 --> 17:50.955
- My dad?
- Shh.

17:51.048 --> 17:52.162
- Dad what?
- He cried.

17:52.257 --> 17:53.288
I didn't say he cried.

17:53.383 --> 17:54.842
- Who cried?
- My dad.
- Stop.

17:54.926 --> 17:58.379
- Why would you make Jay sob like that?
- I didn't make him sob.

17:58.474 --> 18:02.554
He teared up when I found this poem
he wrote for his mom as a boy.

18:02.645 --> 18:03.807
Aw!

18:03.897 --> 18:06.685
- What is "aw"?
- Phil saw Dad cry.

18:06.775 --> 18:08.734
Jay misses his mama.

18:08.820 --> 18:11.526
- Everybody stop.
- Is anybody hungry?

18:13.785 --> 18:16.573
- What?
- You cried for your mommy.

18:16.663 --> 18:19.071
- Oh, crap. I did not.
- Yes. Phil just told...

18:19.166 --> 18:21.076
No, that's not true. She's a liar.

18:21.169 --> 18:22.877
What's wrong with you?

18:22.963 --> 18:24.873
I know you would all be so happy...

18:24.964 --> 18:29.261
if you thought I had some big emotional
moment about my mom, but I didn't.

18:29.347 --> 18:32.598
- So you don't miss your mom?
- Of course I do. She was a great lady.

18:32.684 --> 18:37.513
And she also left me a fantastic recipe
for sauce, which now is getting cold.

18:37.607 --> 18:39.897
- So can we please eat?
- Let's eat.

18:39.985 --> 18:41.527
- Hear! Hear!
- Just grab some wine.

18:41.612 --> 18:44.613
Oh, my gosh. Smell that.

18:44.699 --> 18:47.451
- It smells like Grandma's house.
- Hey, you guys remember that?

18:47.537 --> 18:50.788
- I remember the first time I cut spaghetti.
- "Eh-eh."

18:50.874 --> 18:52.285
And that's what she did. "Eh-eh."

18:52.375 --> 18:54.618
"You can't cut spaghetti."
She taught me to twirl.

18:54.712 --> 18:57.464
- Oh, she's the one.
Yeah, she was tough.

18:57.550 --> 19:00.171
I remember I had this little league coach,
and one time after a game...

19:00.261 --> 19:03.097
he was laying into me about something...
I don't remember.

19:03.181 --> 19:05.638
But Mom comes charging out of the
stands. She goes right up to the guy.

19:05.726 --> 19:07.803
Face-to-face. Nose to nose.

19:07.896 --> 19:10.601
And she says to him,
"Let me tell you something. Nobody...

19:10.690 --> 19:13.894
and I mean nobody yells at my little...

19:15.405 --> 19:16.485
boy."

19:16.574 --> 19:18.900
Oh, my God. It's happening again.

19:18.994 --> 19:21.033
It's okay, Jay. Let it out. Let it out.

19:21.121 --> 19:22.746
You only get one mom.

19:23.749 --> 19:24.949
I'm sorry, Mom.

19:25.961 --> 19:27.669
Me too.

19:27.754 --> 19:30.755
Bottle of red. Bottle of... What?

19:33.262 --> 19:35.801
Oh, yeah. And I'm the weak one?

19:37.975 --> 19:39.175
Mitchell?

19:39.270 --> 19:40.728
I'm good.

20:01.589 --> 20:03.879
- Phil, come on. Oh, honey.

20:03.967 --> 20:05.675
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Get off of me.

20:05.761 --> 20:07.174
I'm sorry.

20:07.263 --> 20:11.049
<i> </i>

20:11.144 --> 20:14.099
- <i>Da-da.</i>
- I think she's calling you.

20:14.189 --> 20:16.763
Don't even try.
I have that pottery class in the morning.

20:16.859 --> 20:18.983
<i> </i>

20:20.155 --> 20:21.900
- Jay, let's go to bed.
- Be right up.

20:21.990 --> 20:23.486
Okay.

20:31.421 --> 20:33.163
Son of a bitch.

20:38.010 --> 20:39.043
English - US - SDH
