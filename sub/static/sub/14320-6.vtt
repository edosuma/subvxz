NARRATOR:
Previously onX-Men...

00:03.500 --> 00:05.750
I've come for
the Princess Lilandra.

00:05.750 --> 00:07.708
BLACK TOM:
She's still a bit
under the weather,

00:07.708 --> 00:10.958
but you didn't specify
what condition
she had to be in.

00:10.958 --> 00:14.166
Tell me where
the M'Kraan Crystal is.

00:14.166 --> 00:16.458
You must
save Lilandra.

00:16.458 --> 00:19.250
Our job
is to find Lilandra
and get out fast.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.000
Anybody know
what she looks like?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.875
She's from
another galaxy.

00:22.875 --> 00:25.208
You see a woman
you don't know,
rescue her.

00:31.583 --> 00:33.000
ERIC THE RED:
Forget these freaks!

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
We must get Lilandra
to my ship.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.583
No!

00:37.750 --> 00:39.500
Let Lilandra go.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.375
ERIC THE RED:
Gladiator!

00:43.375 --> 00:44.875
I have Lilandra.

00:44.875 --> 00:47.500
But where is
the M'Kraan Crystal?

00:47.500 --> 00:49.958
Why do you serve
a madman
like my brother?

00:49.958 --> 00:52.958
Take her
with my respects
to the Emperor.

00:54.208 --> 00:57.833
I am sorry, Princess,
but you must give
your brother the crystal.

00:57.833 --> 01:02.625
No! For the sake
of the universe, no!

01:02.625 --> 01:04.291
PHOENIX: Phoenix must go!

01:11.250 --> 01:13.708

Lilandra is under
my protection.

01:13.708 --> 01:16.458
Learn the power
of Phoenix.

01:18.125 --> 01:19.875
Are you the child
of the crystal?

01:19.875 --> 01:21.458
Yes.

01:21.458 --> 01:23.750
LILANDRA:
You must help me
to keep the crystal

01:23.750 --> 01:26.833
from falling into
the hands of my brother,
the Emperor!

01:29.583 --> 01:32.458
The crystal is here.
I can feel its power.

XAVIER: Do not fear, Lilandra.
The X-Men
will do all in our power

02:45.875 --> 02:47.958
to help you safeguard
the crystal.

02:47.958 --> 02:50.708
But I must return
to my ship at once,

02:50.708 --> 02:54.625
and my transporter
is not strong enough
to bring you with me.

02:54.625 --> 02:56.416
(PHOENIX SIGHS)
I am.

02:58.250 --> 03:00.166
Funny,
you don't look it.

03:00.166 --> 03:04.250
This body is young
and strong.
It recovers quickly.

(GASPING) A ship!

03:10.458 --> 03:14.875

CYCLOPS:
Where's Jean?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.208
Searching the skies.

03:32.625 --> 03:35.208
She's all right, Cyke.
Best I can tell.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.500
Jean? Jean?

03:49.416 --> 03:53.708
It is good that you
are here. Help me
to prepare the others.

03:53.708 --> 03:56.583
-For what?
-For the battle
to save the galaxy.

03:56.583 --> 03:59.416
I can help!
Just tell me how!

03:59.416 --> 04:00.958
I will tell you
what I can.

04:00.958 --> 04:04.166
But there is much
I do not know,

04:04.166 --> 04:07.375
and there is much
I must do alone.

04:08.583 --> 04:10.375
I was heartened
to discover
that you were not

04:10.375 --> 04:13.583
a figment of the Professor's
unbridled imagination.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.875
I am anxious
to learn more
about your people.

04:15.875 --> 04:17.833
Looks like you'll
get your chance.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.125
Listen up, people.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.625
Jean has
something to say.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.250
In our hands
lies the fate

04:24.250 --> 04:28.416
of a billion star systems,
of lives beyond measure.

04:28.416 --> 04:30.208
Just what
I wanted to hear.

04:30.208 --> 04:31.708
It is time to go.

04:37.583 --> 04:38.583
Farewell.

It's no use,
Professor.

05:07.458 --> 05:12.583

it's like they're
not coming back, ever.

Thanks to you,
we have arrived
before my brother.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.125
That's what
all the fuss
is about?

05:50.125 --> 05:52.333
How you fit
a whole galaxy
in there?

05:52.333 --> 05:54.833
Its faceted configuration
gives the crystal

05:54.833 --> 05:58.375
infinite storage capacity
for refracted light energy.

05:58.375 --> 06:02.125
(CHUCKLES) I knew
there had to be
a simple explanation.

06:02.125 --> 06:05.125
You like it, chere?
I'll get you one
for Christmas.

06:11.166 --> 06:13.750
We must move quickly
to safeguard the crystal.

It was some sort
of stun ray.

06:45.708 --> 06:48.416
Lilandra's out colder
than a leftover
hush puppy.

06:48.416 --> 06:53.416
The ray may have been
specifically attuned
to Shi'ar life forms.

06:55.375 --> 06:58.583
Aliens, Corsair!
Ugly ones, too!

06:58.583 --> 07:01.875
Who are you calling ugly,
lizard lips?

07:06.625 --> 07:08.000
Get the crystal!

07:37.333 --> 07:40.291
These are not
the Emperor's troops.

07:40.291 --> 07:45.625
They are intergalactic
pirates who call
themselves the Starjammers.

07:45.625 --> 07:49.083
Pirates? Where do
they keep their swords
and eye patches?

07:51.416 --> 07:53.583
-Raza!
-Aye, captain.

07:53.583 --> 07:56.083
Re-calibrate

the crystal, Logan.

08:43.375 --> 08:45.833
They took Scott, too.

08:45.833 --> 08:49.958
Jean, why did you
stop Cyke when he was
about to blast that joker?

I can't tell you.

That he's Scott's father.

08:59.208 --> 09:02.833
Why have you taken him,

As a hostage?

09:02.833 --> 09:04.958
No, Raza.
Not a hostage.

09:06.875 --> 09:11.458
He's a weapon.

we'll ever need.

to report to you.

Shakari, I ordered you
to intercept Lilandra

09:34.708 --> 09:36.625
and recover
the M'Kraan Crystal.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.583
Why have you not done
as I commanded?

09:48.583 --> 09:52.708
You say a group
of pathetic Earth creatures
defeated you?

09:52.708 --> 09:56.750
You, an Imperial
Shi'ar agent? Fool!

09:58.291 --> 10:01.500
Gladiator, tell me
what has happened.

10:01.500 --> 10:05.250
My lord, is it not
said that the crystal
is protected

10:05.250 --> 10:07.333
by a guardian of
immense power?

10:07.333 --> 10:09.583
The Phoenix
is only a legend.

10:09.583 --> 10:12.250

I have seen her.

Impudent rebel dog!

10:16.875 --> 10:18.458

forgotten me, D'Ken.

Do you remember this?

The M'Kraan Crystal.
Name your price, thief!

10:31.083 --> 10:34.875
I know you'd give
everything you've got
to get your hands on it,

10:34.875 --> 10:37.833
but I'm only asking half.

10:37.833 --> 10:40.208
Half the
Imperial treasury.

My lord,

By the sacred ancestors
of the Shi'ar,

10:46.583 --> 10:48.958
I agree to your price.

10:48.958 --> 10:53.333
I'll bring you the crystal
and a present
for your amusement.

One of the Earth creatures
who've been helping Lilandra.

10:56.166 --> 11:01.333

I was able to deal with them.

11:03.416 --> 11:04.875
Yes, my Emperor?

11:04.875 --> 11:07.958
As soon as
the crystal
is mine,

11:07.958 --> 11:13.875
you will destroy Corsair
and his Starjammers.

11:13.875 --> 11:16.375
But, my lord,
you swore
the Sacred Oath!

11:16.375 --> 11:18.250
You will do it!

11:18.250 --> 11:20.458
Yes, my Emperor.

11:20.458 --> 11:24.750
Imperial Guards,
your Emperor honors us
by sending us against

11:24.750 --> 11:26.750
the rebel Starjammers
in battle.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.833
The leader Corsair will
be taken and destroyed.

11:38.291 --> 11:41.125
The Emperor and I
had a friendly chat.

11:41.125 --> 11:42.458
What are you to him?

11:42.458 --> 11:44.875
A festering wound
in his side.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.750
He calls me
a pirate and worse.

11:47.750 --> 11:48.958
I think he's right.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.291
Perhaps.

11:50.291 --> 11:53.458
But today,
I'm D'Ken's best friend.

11:53.458 --> 11:57.083
Today I'm selling him
the M'Kraan Crystal.

11:57.083 --> 12:00.416
You can't do that!
Don't you know
that if that madman

12:00.416 --> 12:02.000
unleashes the power
of the crystal,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.333
it could destroy
the entire galaxy?

12:04.333 --> 12:06.958
D'Ken will never
touch the crystal,

12:06.958 --> 12:11.750
because you are going
to end his miserable existence.

12:16.708 --> 12:21.166
The only way I can
get close to D'Ken
is to offer him the crystal.

12:21.166 --> 12:23.583
Why are you so determined
to destroy him?

12:23.583 --> 12:26.875
D'Ken has destroyed
millions in his quest
for power.

12:26.875 --> 12:30.500
One of those millions
was my wife.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.416
Does he know
what he's done
to you?

12:32.416 --> 12:34.458
He knows.

12:34.458 --> 12:36.375
Then he'll expect
an attack.

12:36.375 --> 12:41.375
From me, yes.
But not from you,
a helpless prisoner.

12:41.375 --> 12:45.875
You should have one
clear shot from your eyes
at full strength.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.625
I won't take a life
in cold blood.

12:48.625 --> 12:51.000
If D'Ken lives
and gets his hands
on the crystal,

12:51.000 --> 12:55.583
and eventually he will,
billions of lives
will be lost.

12:55.583 --> 12:58.708
Is your sense of honor
worth so much?

13:00.208 --> 13:04.291
Is one woman's life important
enough to risk the fate
of an entire galaxy?

13:07.333 --> 13:09.416
It was to me.

13:24.958 --> 13:29.000
The Starjammeris too fast.
We cannot overtake it.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.125
Fascinating.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.000
Hey!

13:48.000 --> 13:50.708
How can we fight something
we can't catch?

13:50.708 --> 13:54.000
Don't worry, we'll fight
little green men
soon enough.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
You must transport us
to the Starjammer,

13:57.000 --> 13:58.875
just as
you brought us here.

13:58.875 --> 14:03.958
I'm still weak,
but be patient.
I will recover.

14:03.958 --> 14:08.208
Each time I use my powers,
I grow stronger.

14:16.708 --> 14:20.458
The time has come.
Will you help me
destroy the Emperor?

14:20.458 --> 14:24.583
You know that, for the sake
of the galaxy,
I have no choice.

14:30.833 --> 14:34.125
If we fail,
get the Starjammer
to safety.

14:34.125 --> 14:36.375
We shall not
abandon you,
Corsair.

14:36.375 --> 14:41.250
As long as I'm captain
of this ship,
you'll carry out my orders.

14:41.250 --> 14:44.708
If we fail,
someone has to
carry on the fight.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.583
I come
from your planet.

15:07.583 --> 15:08.958
How is that
possible?

15:08.958 --> 15:10.416

15:10.416 --> 15:13.000
That's a long story.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.458
We're so close to Earth now.
I would've liked
to have seen it again.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.166
Do you have
any children?

15:20.166 --> 15:21.583
No.

15:21.583 --> 15:24.083
I wouldn't know mine
now if I saw them.

15:24.083 --> 15:28.875
Except I remember
my oldest boy.
He had his mother's eyes.

15:31.708 --> 15:34.500
If I can contact Cyclops
telepathically,

15:34.500 --> 15:38.583
I can use the mind-link
like a homing beacon.

15:42.625 --> 15:46.083

is the leader
of the X-Men.

15:46.083 --> 15:50.625

creature is of
no interest to me.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.166
Out of my way,
woman.

17:58.166 --> 18:00.625
Get out of
your own way!

18:00.625 --> 18:02.125
Thank you, Rogue.

18:02.125 --> 18:03.500
I enjoyed it.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.208
Gladiator!
Cut off their retreat!

18:11.625 --> 18:14.000
Everyone! Head for
the Starjammer!

18:18.500 --> 18:19.708
(GROANS)

18:29.083 --> 18:30.458
Let's move it!

18:39.000 --> 18:40.583
The bigger
they are...

18:43.291 --> 18:45.166
Help!

18:45.166 --> 18:47.333
(WOLVERINE GRUNTING)

18:51.125 --> 18:52.458
What's cooking?

18:52.458 --> 18:53.708
Come, my friend!

18:54.708 --> 18:57.375
Stop fooling around,
Gambit! We gotta go!

19:00.416 --> 19:04.583
"Our safety is our speed."
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.708
I'll help you, Beast!

19:15.708 --> 19:17.458
It was the thought
that counted.

19:17.458 --> 19:18.625
I got it, Beast.

19:21.833 --> 19:23.000
Is that everyone?

19:25.708 --> 19:27.708
It is now.

19:27.708 --> 19:28.708
Scott!

19:30.333 --> 19:31.708
Let's go!

19:31.708 --> 19:33.458
You don't have to
tell me twice!

19:33.458 --> 19:36.708
Corsair to Starjammer.
Get ready to... D'Ken!

19:38.750 --> 19:43.333
One false move, X-Men,
and Gladiator
will crush Lilandra!

19:43.333 --> 19:44.583
(SNARLING)

19:44.583 --> 19:46.458
No, Logan.
It's up to me now.

19:46.458 --> 19:49.500
In the name
of Sharra and K'ythri,

19:49.500 --> 19:52.083
and the sacred ancestors
of the Shi'ar...

19:52.083 --> 19:54.000
D'Ken! No!

19:54.000 --> 19:56.166
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

19:56.166 --> 20:01.208
I call upon
the nine dying stars, and
the world that has no name!

20:01.208 --> 20:02.291
Stop!

20:04.208 --> 20:07.083
I am the guardian
of the crystal.

20:07.083 --> 20:12.583
Unlock the power
of the M'Kraan
and make the galaxy mine!

20:16.750 --> 20:18.500
You are too late!

20:22.333 --> 20:25.958
I was not yet
strong enough
to stop him.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.625
It has begun.
By opening a breach
in the crystal,

20:29.625 --> 20:33.708
D'Ken has unleashed
the power of
the negative galaxy inside.

20:33.708 --> 20:35.333
You mean
it might get out?

20:38.000 --> 20:41.166
I mean we
and everything
we know

20:41.166 --> 20:43.416
may soon be pulled in.

20:52.958 --> 20:55.458
