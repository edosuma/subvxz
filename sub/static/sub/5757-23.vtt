WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:05.206
I JUST CAN'T EVER PICTURE
ALISON WEARING THIS.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.607
A PICTURE OF
VIVIAN DARKBLOOM.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.542
THEY OFFERED ME THE JOB.
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

00:08.576 --> 00:10.778
MY DAD,
IS HE YOUR FATHER TOO?
WHO TOLD YOU?

00:10.811 --> 00:13.447
IT'S REALLY NONE OF YOUR
BUSINESS WHERE HE IS.
OH, IT'S MY BUSINESS.

00:13.481 --> 00:14.815
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
THAT UNTIL RECENTLY.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.584
EZRA'S TAKING THAT JOB
IN NEW ORLEANS.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.420
WHAT JOB?
THE JOB THAT DAD
SET HIM UP WITH.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.556
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS IS.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.425
WHAT'S WRONG?
IT'S SPENCER.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.295
BEFORE YOU AND SHE GOT TOGETHER,
SHE WAS SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.696
HE'S BACK NOW.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.264
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GIVE ME ANY ANSWERS,

00:30.298 --> 00:31.832
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
LOOKING FOR THEM MYSELF.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.034
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.
HANNA!

00:35.503 --> 00:37.271
VIVIAN?

00:39.773 --> 00:43.444
* WAKE UP WAKE UP
THE STARS ARE OUT *

00:43.477 --> 00:45.079
WELL,
HE RECOGNIZED THE COAT,

00:45.113 --> 00:46.314
BUT WHEN HE SAW IT FIRST,

00:46.347 --> 00:49.083
HE THOUGHT IT WAS
ALISON-- VIVIAN.

00:49.117 --> 00:50.718
WHEN WE NOTICED YOU DIDN'T
COME BACK, HE WAS GONE.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.153
HE WAS CUTE FROM THE BACK.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.788
SO WAS HIS FRONT,

00:54.822 --> 00:56.790
UNDER DIFFERENT
CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.527
HE'S BEEN IN FLORIDA
FOR, LIKE, A YEAR.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.829
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM
EXACTLY?

01:01.862 --> 01:05.233
UH, I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS
A FRIEND OF VIVIAN'S

01:05.266 --> 01:07.368
AND THAT I HADN'T SEEN HER
SINCE SHE GAVE ME THE COAT.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.139
CAN I SEE THAT
NUMBER AGAIN?
YEAH.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.474
THANKS.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.176
DUNCAN ALBERT?

01:15.209 --> 01:16.610
HE SAID HE MET HER
IN BROOKHAVEN?

01:16.644 --> 01:18.312
YEAH, IN A BOOKSTORE.

01:18.346 --> 01:19.847
COUPLE PLACES DOWN FROM THAT
CREEPY DOLL HOSPITAL.

01:19.880 --> 01:23.151
WELL, WHOEVER DUNCAN IS,
HE'S CONNECTED TO ALISON

01:23.184 --> 01:24.618
AND WHAT SHE WANTED
IN BROOKHAVEN.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.387
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT HE
WASN'T JUST SOME GUY

01:26.420 --> 01:27.788
SHE FLIRTED WITH
IN A BOOKSTORE?

01:27.821 --> 01:30.191
I DON'T THINK ALISON WASTED
VIVIAN ON FLIRTING.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.859
WHEN SHE PUT THAT WIG ON,
SHE WANTED SOMETHING.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.794
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR "A".

01:33.827 --> 01:35.629
DUNCAN WAS PART
OF THAT TRAIL.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.465
I'LL CALL HIM.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.333
ARIA, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.768
ANY ONE OF US COULD'VE
BEEN WEARING THAT COAT.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.270
BUT IT WAS ME.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.326
Hanna: SHE HAD
THE OPERATION.

02:14.368 --> 02:17.738
Aria: SPENCE?

02:24.978 --> 02:27.748
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

02:27.781 --> 02:30.351
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

02:30.384 --> 02:32.320
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

02:32.353 --> 02:34.655
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

02:34.688 --> 02:36.957
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

02:36.990 --> 02:40.528
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

02:40.561 --> 02:44.898
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

02:46.867 --> 02:49.903
I'M NOT BEING UNREASONABLE,
I'M BEING YOUR MOTHER.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.805
NO, YOU ARE CUTTING ME
OFF FROM THE WORLD.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.775
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO
RUINED YOUR PHONE, YOU ARE.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.577
AND SINCE YOU WERE
OKAY ABOUT DOING THAT,

02:56.610 --> 02:58.246
I GUESS THAT MEANS YOU
DON'T NEED A REPLACEMENT.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.813
I CAN'T GO AROUND
WITHOUT A PHONE.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.716
IT'S LIKE GOING AROUND
WITHOUT A BRAIN, OR SHOES.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.618
PHONE IS A PRIVILEGE,
NOT A RIGHT.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.754
SUPPOSE THERE WAS
AN EMERGENCY.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.890
I'M SURE EMILY WOULD LET YOU USE
YOUR PHONE IN AN EMERGENCY.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.859
SURE.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.727
I MEAN, WELL, YEAH.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.296
OKAY, NO.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.930
EMILY AND I ONLY HAVE
ONE CLASS TOGETHER.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.232
I NEED MY OWN PHONE.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.268
TODAY IS ABOUT
WHAT I NEED.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.603
I NEED TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
IN MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.938
WHEN YOU DECIDE TO TALK
ABOUT THAT, WE CAN
DISCUSS A NEW PHONE.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.308
I'LL SEE YOU
BOTH AT DINNER.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.914
IT'S REALLY OLD,
LIKE SIX MONTHS.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.284
BUT IT WORKS PRETTY
GOOD FOR AN ANTIQUE.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.718
THE NUMBER BILLS
TO MY ACCOUNT.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.753
YOUR MOM NEVER
HAS TO KNOW.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.022
OH. MONA,
YOU ARE A LIFE SAVER.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.957
WELL, WHAT'S THE POINT
OF DOING SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE

03:43.991 --> 03:45.826
IF IT DOESN'T MAKE
YOU LOOK GOOD?

03:45.859 --> 03:47.795
I'M ALREADY NUMBER ONE
ON THE SPEED DIAL. CIAO!

03:49.630 --> 03:51.999
IF ONLY WE COULD HARNESS
MONA'S SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT,

03:52.032 --> 03:53.667
WE COULD LIGHT
THE EASTERN SEABOARD.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.403
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T CARE.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.405
I GOT A NEW PHONE AND DIDN'T
HAVE TO GO THROUGH CALEB.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.340
HE'S SAFE IN MONTECITO.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.474
DID YOU GET THROUGH
TO DUNCAN YET?

04:00.508 --> 04:02.276
YEAH, HE'S COMING AFTER SCHOOL.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.477
I'M GONNA MEET HIM
IN THE COURTYARD.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.845
THAT SOUNDS SAFE.

04:04.878 --> 04:05.846
( bell rings )
YEAH.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.615
LATER.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.384
BYE.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.988
( phone chimes )

04:41.549 --> 04:44.385
( exhales )
HELLO.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.820
HELLO.

04:46.854 --> 04:50.791
YOU'RE BACK.

04:50.824 --> 04:54.094
AND-- UH, OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'RE BACK.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.429
YOU ARE.

04:55.463 --> 04:58.899
YEAH, WE'RE BACK.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.501
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:00.534 --> 05:01.935
FINE.

05:01.969 --> 05:05.806
UH, JENNA'S EYE.
SHE GOT THE SURGERY.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.108
YEAH, SHE DID.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.344
JUST THE ONE EYE?

05:10.378 --> 05:13.681
THEY DO IT IN
ONE EYE AT A TIME.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.916
HOW DID IT GO?

05:15.949 --> 05:17.918
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW YET.

05:21.455 --> 05:25.393
I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU GUYS TOGETHER.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.095
WHY?

05:31.031 --> 05:33.133
I DON'T KNOW.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.802
YES, I DO, ACTUALLY.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.604
YOU WENT THROUGH SO MUCH
TO GET AWAY FROM HER,

05:36.637 --> 05:38.506
AND NOW YOU'RE BACK TO JUST
GUIDING HER AROUND.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.107
NOT FOR MUCH LONGER.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.675
BESIDES, SHE'S MY SISTER.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.544
STEP-SISTER.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.779
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.882
WORSE THAN ANY OF US.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.519
THAT'S COMING TO AN END.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.454
BETTER GET USED TO THAT IDEA.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.661
TOBY...

06:00.694 --> 06:03.964
I'VE BEEN THINKING
A LOT ABOUT US.

06:03.997 --> 06:08.135
IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT, ISN'T IT?

06:13.607 --> 06:15.476
( door opens )

06:15.509 --> 06:17.978
TOBY? I'M READY TO GO.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.584
SPENCER, IS THAT YOU?

06:23.617 --> 06:25.453
YEAH.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.422
I THOUGHT SO.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.538
( sighs )

06:49.477 --> 06:52.946
SO, WERE YOU LOOKING
FOR VIVIAN IN BROOKHAVEN?

06:52.980 --> 06:55.583
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION FIRST?

06:55.616 --> 06:58.085
SURE.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.454
IS ARIA YOUR REAL NAME?

07:00.488 --> 07:03.056
WHAT? YES.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.758
OF COURSE IT IS.
WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT?

07:04.792 --> 07:08.629
BECAUSE VIVIAN'S REAL
NAME WASN'T VIVIAN.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.565
AND IF YOU'RE HER FRIEND,
YOU'LL KNOW HER REAL NAME.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.209
ALISON.

07:22.242 --> 07:25.245
WE HAVE A WINNER.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.115
SO WHERE IS SHE?

07:32.252 --> 07:36.524
DUNCAN...

07:36.557 --> 07:38.158
ALISON'S DEAD.

07:43.230 --> 07:46.634
I'M-- I'M SORRY.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.639
SHE DISAPPEARED
LABOR DAY WEEKEND

07:51.672 --> 07:53.106
YEAR BEFORE LAST.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.608
DISAPPEARED?

07:54.642 --> 07:55.776
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.911
LOOK, I-- MAYBE--

07:57.945 --> 07:59.847
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

08:02.883 --> 08:04.718
SHE WAS KILLED AND...

08:04.752 --> 08:08.021
THEY DIDN'T FIND HER
BODY FOR A YEAR.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.265
DO THEY KNOW WHO DID IT?

08:19.667 --> 08:21.569
NO.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.738
THE COPS MUST HAVE
SOME IDEAS.

08:24.772 --> 08:27.675
YEAH, WE-- WE DON'T
REALLY TRUST THE COPS.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.042
WHO'S WE?

08:29.076 --> 08:33.947
ME AND SOME
OF ALISON'S FRIENDS.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.951
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
KEPT THE JOURNALS.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.988
THE WRITER.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.222
SHE TALKED ABOUT YOU.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.658
THERE ARE FOUR
OF YOU, RIGHT?

08:44.692 --> 08:45.793
SHE TALKED ABOUT US?

08:45.826 --> 08:46.860
YES.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.129
SHE TALKED ABOUT
YOU GUYS A LOT.

08:49.162 --> 08:52.633
DID SHE EVER...

08:52.666 --> 08:54.668
TALK ABOUT ANYONE ELSE?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.704
SOMEONE THAT SHE
MIGHT'VE BEEN AFRAID OF?

08:58.371 --> 09:01.108
LOOK, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE
TALKING ABOUT THIS HERE.

09:01.141 --> 09:04.745
DID YOU ONLY MEET HER
IN THAT BOOKSTORE?

09:04.778 --> 09:06.213
NO.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.216
NO, WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
TOGETHER THAT SUMMER.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.051
IN BROOKHAVEN?

09:11.084 --> 09:13.220
NEAR BROOKHAVEN.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.656
WELL, I--
I COULD MEET YOU THERE.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.227
I'LL CALL YOU.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.568
THE WEEKEND YOU SAID
SHE DISAPPEARED...

09:32.305 --> 09:33.807
I SAW HER THAT WEEKEND.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.619
Spencer: DUNCAN SAW
ALI THAT WEEKEND?

09:45.653 --> 09:48.155
ARE WE SURE WE BELIEVE HIM?

09:48.188 --> 09:50.991
HE WAS ALL TORN UP
WHEN I TOLD HIM SHE WAS DEAD.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.260
HE COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN FAKING THAT.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.295
EM, YOU OKAY?

09:55.328 --> 09:59.967
SURE.
( engine starts, revs )

10:00.000 --> 10:02.770
( tires screech )

10:02.803 --> 10:06.006
WHY IS GARRETT
IN SUCH A HURRY?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.842
( phones ring, beep )

10:10.811 --> 10:14.314
"WHERE THERE'S SMOKE,
THERE'S PAYBACK, 'A'"

10:19.820 --> 10:21.254
WAIT, WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:21.288 --> 10:22.856
I DON'T KNOW.

10:22.890 --> 10:26.960
WHAT ARE THEY TALKING
TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ABOUT?

10:26.994 --> 10:28.896
THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT THAT NIGHT.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.298
THE JENNA THING.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.266
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.135
WHAT COULD TOBY
BE TELLING THEM?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.971
I DID SUCH A GOOD JOB
OF SCREWING HIM UP,

10:38.005 --> 10:39.740
HE MIGHT SAY ANYTHING JENNA
WANTS HIM TO SAY.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.744
THAT WE WERE THE ONES
WHO BLINDED JENNA?

10:43.777 --> 10:46.113
ALISON AND US.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.860
( inaudible )

11:09.837 --> 11:11.939
REMEMBER THAT OLD MOVIE
ABOUT THE BLIND LADY

11:11.972 --> 11:13.874
THAT GO HER SIGHT BACK?

11:13.907 --> 11:15.709
I DON'T REMEMBER.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.444
SHE FILLED HER ROOM WITH ALL
THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS SHE OWNED

11:17.477 --> 11:19.446
SO SHE COULD SEE THEM
WHEN SHE OPENED HER EYES.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.449
I'M GONNA DO THAT.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.084
BEFORE THEY TAKE
THE BANDAGES OFF,

11:24.117 --> 11:27.988
I'M GONNA FILL MY ROOM
WITH THE THINGS THAT I LOVE.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.057
YOU'LL BE THERE TOO.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.693
THAT WOMAN IN THE MOVIE
WAS A MEAN OLD BITCH.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.064
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.933
( background chatter )

11:45.538 --> 11:48.141
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T TAKE
THAT CAST OFF BY YOURSELF.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.378
I WAS OUT OF TOWN.
I SAW ANOTHER DOCTOR.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.380
WELL, DON'T FAVOR IT.
DID THEY GIVE YOU EXERCISES?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.348
YES.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.785
GOOD.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.988
I'M JENNA,
TOBY'S SISTER.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.455
HI, JENNA.
I'M DR. KINGSTON.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.057
I HELPED YOUR BROTHER
WHEN HE HAD HIS ACCIDENT.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.893
I REMEMBER.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.527
DOES SPENCER
KNOW YOU'RE BACK?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.797
YES.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.767
NICE MEETING YOU, JENNA.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.268
THANK YOU FOR LOOKING
AFTER MY BROTHER.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.469
GLAD TO BE OF SERVICE.

12:19.539 --> 12:22.275
SO THAT'S SPENCER'S
PERSONAL PHYSICIAN?

12:22.309 --> 12:24.111
THAT'S HIM.

12:25.913 --> 12:29.249
I BET EVEN A LIE WOULD
SOUND GOOD IN THAT ACCENT.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.060
HEY.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.461
HEY.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.997
YOU OKAY?

12:44.031 --> 12:46.333
I DON'T KNOW.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.201
YOU THINKING ABOUT TOBY?

12:48.235 --> 12:51.438
IS IT MY FAULT?
DID I MAKE THAT HAPPEN?

12:51.471 --> 12:53.807
YOU BROKE OFF WITH HIM
TO KEEP HIM SAFE.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.075
YEAH, I WANTED HIM SAFE,

12:55.108 --> 12:56.944
AND HE ENDED UP
BACK WITH JENNA.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.446
IT'S LIKE OUT OF THE FRYING
PAN AND INTO THE VOLCANO.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.882
I MADE YOU HELP.

13:01.915 --> 13:05.252
WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.520
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM YOUR DAD?

13:07.554 --> 13:11.258
HE EMAILED ME ON
A LAYOVER IN GERMANY.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.961
ARE YOU OKAY?

13:13.994 --> 13:16.363
YOU NEVER GET USED TO IT
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

13:16.396 --> 13:20.433
MY MOM'S GONNA BE
BACK HERE NEXT WEEK.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.503
HAVE MAYA'S PARENT'S
HEARD FROM HER?

13:23.536 --> 13:27.040
NO, THEY HAVEN'T.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.076
I HAVE.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.477
WHAT?

13:30.510 --> 13:32.345
YEAH, SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
WHERE IS SHE?

13:32.379 --> 13:33.947
SHE HASN'T TOLD ME YET.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.548
ARE YOU GONNA
TELL HER PARENTS?

13:35.582 --> 13:37.184
SHE ASKED ME NOT TO.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.186
BUT I KEEP THINKING HOW
MY PARENTS WOULD FEEL

13:39.219 --> 13:40.420
IF I WAS MISSING.

13:40.453 --> 13:44.157
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.492
( bell rings )

13:45.525 --> 13:46.459
BETTER GO.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.532
SPENCER. EMILY.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.202
HEY, I'M SO SORRY THAT
I HAVEN'T CALLED YOU BACK.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.270
MY RESERVES HAVE
BEEN REALLY DEPLETED, AND--

13:57.304 --> 13:59.306
THIS ISN'T ABOUT--

13:59.339 --> 14:02.375
UM, I'VE GOT SOME
OF ALISON'S THINGS.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.411
I'VE BEEN THROUGH THEM,
BUT, I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT TO DO WITH THEM.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.279
WHAT KIND OF THINGS?

14:06.313 --> 14:08.581
THEY'RE IN A BAG THAT WAS LEFT
IN THE HOUSE WHEN WE MOVED OUT.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.483
YOUR FRIEND MAYA SAID
HER FAMILY FOUND THEM.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.553
SHE SAID THAT THEY
PACKED UP SOME OF ALI'S
THINGS BY ACCIDENT.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.122
MAYA DROPPED THEM OFF
AT THE HOUSE.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.491
MAYA DID?
DID YOU TALK TO HER?

14:18.525 --> 14:20.293
THE BAG WAS ON THE PORCH.

14:20.327 --> 14:23.330
AND THEN I SAW IN THE
PAPER MAYA WAS MISSING.
IS THAT TRUE?

14:23.363 --> 14:26.233
YEAH.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.902
SO THE BAG HAS
ALI'S STUFF IN IT?

14:28.936 --> 14:31.404
YEAH, SOME OF THE
THINGS FROM HER ROOM.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.540
I JUST THOUGHT YOU GUYS
MIGHT WANNA HAVE A LOOK.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.914
( knocking )

14:40.948 --> 14:41.881
YEAH?

14:43.951 --> 14:45.652
CAN I INTERRUPT?

14:45.685 --> 14:50.090
YES. COME IN.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.692
( grunts )

14:52.725 --> 14:55.695
I COULD OFFER YOU
CHOCOLATE MILK OR AN APPLE.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.598
THANK YOU, BUT NO.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.534
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
THE CONVERSATION WE HAD

15:01.568 --> 15:03.003
IN YOUR APARTMENT.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.671
YES.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.673
I'VE NEVER HAD
A CONVERSATION
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.408
NEITHER HAVE I.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.310
SO, I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

15:10.343 --> 15:13.680
I DIDN'T LEAVE YOU WITH
THE WRONG IMPRESSION.

15:13.713 --> 15:17.250
JUST BECAUSE I WANNA TALK ABOUT
THIS DOES NOT MAKE ME AN ALLY.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.686
I KNOW, COMPARED TO
MY HUSBAND'S ATTITUDE,

15:19.719 --> 15:21.454
IT MAY LOOK THAT WAY.

15:21.488 --> 15:24.091
BUT I'M NOT.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.326
THE ONLY PERSON I CARE
ABOUT HERE IS MY DAUGHTER.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.430
SO YOU--
YOU WANT ME GONE TOO.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.200
OUT OF SIGHT,
OUT OF MIND.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.535
THAT'S WHAT BYRON
IS THINKING.

15:35.568 --> 15:40.007
THAT'S WHY HE ENGINEERED
THAT JOB OFFER FOR YOU,

15:40.040 --> 15:42.475
BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE
AN OPINION ON THAT.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.445
YES, YOU DO.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.948
YES, I DO.

15:50.717 --> 15:51.651
ELLA...

15:53.686 --> 15:56.289
IT DOES ACTUALLY MATTER
WHAT YOU THINK OF ME.

16:04.264 --> 16:08.635
HAS ARIA EVER MENTIONED
SOMEONE BULLYING HER?

16:08.668 --> 16:10.237
UM, BULLYING IS
NOT THE RIGHT WORD.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.205
DO YOU KNOW OF
ANYONE WHO WOULD

16:12.239 --> 16:15.375
USE THIS SITUATION
TO HURT HER?

16:15.408 --> 16:19.179
NOT-- HER, NOT INTENTIONALLY.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.014
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

16:21.048 --> 16:24.684
IS THERE SOMEONE WHO WOULD WANT
TO HURT YOU INTENTIONALLY?

16:24.717 --> 16:27.120
THERE MIGHT'VE BEEN,

16:27.154 --> 16:30.257
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.133
FRANKLY, I'D LOVE
TO TAKE THAT CANE

16:40.167 --> 16:41.601
AND WHACK HER
LIKE A PIÑATA.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.770
MONA!
JUST KIDDING, SORT OF.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.173
BUT SHE POACHED NOEL KAHN
RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER ME.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.141
AND SHE DID THAT BLIND.

16:48.175 --> 16:51.144
WHAT'S JENNA GONNA BE LIKE
IF SHE GETS TO SEE AGAIN?

16:51.178 --> 16:52.712
I CAN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.382
SPENCER IS LUCKY TO
BE FINISHED WITH TOBY

16:55.415 --> 16:56.516
AND THE HOUSE OF CREEPS.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.518
OKAY, SHE IS
STILL HURTING HERE.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.054
LOOK, SPENCER'S
REALLY SMART.

17:01.088 --> 17:04.424
SHE SAID SOME THINGS TO ME
WHEN NOEL WAS SLICING UP MY
HEART THAT REALLY HELPED.

17:04.457 --> 17:07.627
I GET THAT THEY'RE BROKEN UP,
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T HATE HER.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.662
I JUST WISH THERE WAS A WAY

17:09.695 --> 17:12.365
TO GET TOBY AWAY FROM JENNA
FOR AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES.

17:12.398 --> 17:14.300
ARE WE SCHEMING?

17:14.334 --> 17:15.801
I THINK SO.

17:15.835 --> 17:16.769
GOODY.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.609
THANKS SO MUCH FOR
MEETING ME HERE.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.746
MY SCHEDULE'S JUST
BEEN REALLY STACKED.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.548
ARE YOU SURE YOU
WOULDN'T WANT SOMETHING

17:28.581 --> 17:30.550
A LITTLE EASIER TO HANDLE?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.685
OH, NO, IT'S NOT FOR ME.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.587
I TOLD YOU,
IT'S FOR MY COUSIN.

17:34.621 --> 17:37.457
YEAH. HE'S GOING THROUGH THIS
REALLY BIG ROCKABILLY PHASE.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.226
SO, I TOLD HIM
I'D KEEP AN EYE OUT

17:39.259 --> 17:40.593
FOR APPROPRIATE
TRANSPORTATION.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.563
OH! LOOK,
A CASSETTE PLAYER.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.299
HOW DE-CLASSE.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.404
YOUR COUSIN'S GONNA HAVE
TO FIND ANOTHER TRUCK.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.375
JUST GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.578
HE'S ALL YOURS.

17:58.611 --> 17:59.712
WE HAVE TO TALK.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.314
WE'VE GOT NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.516
I GET HOW YOU'RE
MAD AT SPENCER.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.818
BUT YOU'RE SO MAD,
YOU DON'T SEE WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

18:05.852 --> 18:09.256
TOBY, YOU CAN NOT LET JENNA
BACK INTO YOUR LIFE AGAIN.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.358
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS
SHUT UP ABOUT MY SISTER.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.393
IF YOU'RE DOING THIS
TO HURT SPENCER--

18:13.426 --> 18:15.395
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M DOING.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.796
OR WHY I'M DOING IT.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.299
OKAY, FINE.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.868
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?

18:21.901 --> 18:24.537
DID YOU FORGET EVERYTHING
JENNA DID TO YOU?

18:24.571 --> 18:27.440
NO. DID YOU FORGET
WHAT YOU DID TO HER?

18:42.855 --> 18:44.557
HAVE YOU LOOKED INSIDE?

18:44.591 --> 18:46.826
JUST ENOUGH TO
KNOW IT'S ALISON'S.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.228
( knocking )

18:48.261 --> 18:50.830
HEY.
HEY.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.835
OKAY, SO DUNCAN JUST CALLED
BACK AND HE WANTS TO TALK.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.704
IS THAT ALISON'S BAG?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.206
YEAH, THAT'S IT.
COME TAKE A LOOK.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.674
I CAN'T. I TOLD DUNCAN
I'D GO MEET HIM.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.376
WHERE?

19:03.410 --> 19:04.577
A PLACE CALLED HALLOW ACRES.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.246
HE SAID HE USED TO GO
THERE WITH ALISON.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.648
OKAY, JUST GIVE US A CALL
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.483
I WILL. PROMISE.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.252
HEY, EM. BYE.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.554
BYE.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.498
( Fur Elise plays )

19:26.966 --> 19:29.836
SHE HAD THAT
WHEN SHE WAS A KID.

19:37.009 --> 19:41.581
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU GUYS FIND IN HERE
YOU WANNA KEEP, TAKE IT.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.716
SHOULD BRING THE BAG BACK
TO THE HOUSE WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.618
OKAY.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.854
IF I'M NOT THERE,
JUST DROP IT ON
THE BACK PORCH.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.256
THANK YOU, JASON.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.933
DID HE ASK TO COME HERE?

20:00.967 --> 20:03.570
NO. I INVITED HIM.

20:03.603 --> 20:04.937
DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.439
WE DON'T NEED TO
COMPLICATE THINGS.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.609
I'M TRYING TO
UN-COMPLICATE THEM.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.412
WELL, DON'T.
LEAVE IT ALONE.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.746
THERE'S NOTHING
FOR YOU TO FIX.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.981
SO, WHAT?

20:15.014 --> 20:16.483
WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED
TO GO BACK

20:16.516 --> 20:17.750
TO THE WAY IT WAS
BEFORE WE ALL KNEW?

20:17.784 --> 20:21.254
FURTHER, IF POSSIBLE.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.762
( plane engine revs )

20:29.796 --> 20:30.863
HI.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.432
YOU'RE LATE.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.502
YEAH, IT KINDA TOOK ME
A WHILE TO FIND YOU.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.405
YOU AND ALI CAME HERE?

20:38.438 --> 20:40.573
ON THE DAYS,
I TOOK HER FLYING, YEAH.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.710
FLYING! IN A PLANE?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.678
USUALLY.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.315
YOU HAVE, LIKE,
A LICENSE OR SOMETHING?

20:48.348 --> 20:51.584
NOT LIKE A LICENSE,
AN ACTUAL LICENSE.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.819
PILOT SINCE I WAS 16.

20:54.787 --> 20:55.788
SO, YOU'RE READY?

20:55.822 --> 20:58.558
I'M SORRY.
READY FOR WHAT?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.460
TO TALK ABOUT ALISON.

21:21.481 --> 21:25.352
( sighs )

21:25.385 --> 21:27.620
I THOUGHT WE'D
FIND SOMETHING.

21:27.654 --> 21:32.359
ME TOO. I DON'T KNOW
WHY, BUT I DID.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.293
IT'S JUST STUFF.

21:35.962 --> 21:41.300
DISCONNECTED STUFF.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.872
HOW OFTEN DID YOU
TAKE HER FLYING?

21:45.905 --> 21:48.708
ON AND OFF THAT SUMMER.

21:48.741 --> 21:52.512
AS OFTEN AS I COULD.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.550
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING ELSE?

21:57.584 --> 21:59.986
WAS I IN LOVE WITH HER?

22:00.019 --> 22:03.089
I COULD'VE BEEN,

22:03.122 --> 22:06.459
IF SOMEBODY HADN'T
GOTTEN IN THE WAY.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.695
ANOTHER BOY?

22:08.728 --> 22:10.563
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.

22:10.597 --> 22:14.734
AT LEAST I HAD HER
ALL TO MYSELF UP HERE.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.637
IT MADE HER FEEL... SAFE.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.673
SAFE?

22:20.707 --> 22:23.410
YEAH, NOTHING
COULD GET TO HER.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.845
SHE HAD CONTROL.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.048
DO YOU WANNA TRY IT?

22:29.081 --> 22:30.983
DO I WANNA WHAT?

22:31.017 --> 22:32.685
TAKE THE YOKE.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.053
NO, THANKS.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.822
YOU WANNA
UNDERSTAND YOUR FRIEND?

22:35.855 --> 22:37.790
WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR?

22:37.824 --> 22:39.392
TAKE CONTROL.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.034
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT IT?

22:48.067 --> 22:49.469
I GOT IT.

22:56.976 --> 22:59.746
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

22:59.779 --> 23:01.681
I DON'T KNOW.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.854
SHE'D SIT IN THAT SEAT,

23:07.887 --> 23:10.823
I COULD JUST SEE
HER FACE CHANGE.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.525
NO MASKS,

23:12.559 --> 23:15.828
NOTHING TO HIDE FROM,
OR BE AFRAID OF.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.731
THEY COULDN'T GET TO HER.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.500
WHO'S THEY?

23:20.533 --> 23:23.936
MAYBE A STRANGER.

23:23.970 --> 23:26.673
MAYBE SOME BOY SHE KNEW.

23:26.706 --> 23:30.943
MAYBE A FRIEND.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.211
( turbulence, gasps )
KEEP IT LEVEL.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.146
OKAY, I-- I DON'T WANNA
DO THIS ANYMORE.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.582
JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.491
I'VE DONE SOME READING
SINCE WE TALKED.

23:44.524 --> 23:47.527
THE PAPERS SAID A MAN
NAMED IAN THOMAS

23:47.560 --> 23:51.030
CONFESSED TO KILLING ALISON
BEFORE HE COMMITTED SUICIDE.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.199
LEFT A NOTE AND EVERYTHING.

23:56.736 --> 23:59.205
THE NOTE--
THE NOTE WAS FAKE.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.240
WE-- WE DON'T
THINK THAT HE DID IT.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.010
WE THINK THAT HE--
( gasps )

24:04.043 --> 24:08.581
WE THINK THAT HE WAS
TRYING TO PROTECT SOMEBODY.

24:25.998 --> 24:29.268
LOOK, ALISON CALLED
ME FROM HILTON HEAD

24:29.301 --> 24:32.204
SUNDAY THAT
LABOR DAY WEEKEND.

24:32.238 --> 24:34.807
SHE WANTED ME TO FLY HER
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA

24:34.841 --> 24:36.676
TO A FIELD OUTSIDE
PHILADELPHIA.

24:36.709 --> 24:39.278
YOU FLEW HER
FROM HILTON HEAD?

24:39.311 --> 24:40.780
PICKED HER UP THAT MORNING.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.687
SHE WAS DIFFERENT THAT DAY.

24:47.720 --> 24:51.891
SHE FIGURED SOMETHING OUT.

24:51.924 --> 24:55.127
WAIT, IF ALI WAS WITH YOU,

24:55.161 --> 24:56.663
SHE WAS IN TOWN SIX,
SEVEN HOURS

24:56.696 --> 25:00.099
BEFORE WE THOUGHT
SHE GOT THERE.

25:11.711 --> 25:14.547
( background chatter )

25:18.718 --> 25:21.220
I GOT A MESSAGE YOU
WANTED TO TALK TO ME?

25:21.253 --> 25:24.591
YES, I DO.

25:24.624 --> 25:27.660
I GOT ANOTHER CALL
FROM PROFESSOR SCHAFFER

25:27.694 --> 25:31.330
ABOUT THE ASSOCIATE DEAN
POSITION IN NEW ORLEANS.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.033
HE WANTS MY DECISION.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.702
OH, IT'S A CHOICE
ASSIGNMENT.

25:35.735 --> 25:39.171
IT IS, AND I'M GONNA CALL
HIM IN A FEW MINUTES.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.107
BUT, I WANTED
TO TELL YOU FIRST.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.810
WHY ME?

25:43.843 --> 25:47.113
WELL, BECAUSE YOU WERE
SO INSTRUMENTAL IN MY
BEING CONSIDERED.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.081
( sighs )

25:49.115 --> 25:52.084
WELL, I WOULDN'T
SAY INSTRUMENTAL.

25:52.118 --> 25:53.953
I MEAN, I MIGHT'VE
MENTIONED YOUR NAME.

25:53.986 --> 25:57.757
IT WAS VERY
GENEROUS OF YOU.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.693
THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANT THERE
TO BE ANY MISUNDERSTANDING

26:00.727 --> 26:04.063
WHEN I TELL YOU THAT
I'M NOT TAKING THE JOB.

26:04.096 --> 26:07.033
( chuckles )
WELL, I--

26:07.066 --> 26:09.001
I THINK YOU'RE
MAKING A MISTAKE.

26:09.035 --> 26:13.740
POSSIBLY, BUT IT'S NOT THE
MISTAKE YOU THINK I'M MAKING.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.745
YOU NEED TO RECONSIDER THIS.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.913
SERIOUSLY RECONSIDER IT.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.149
I KNOW IT IS
A SPECTACULAR JOB

26:23.182 --> 26:25.217
THAT WILL PUT MY CAREER

26:25.251 --> 26:27.119
YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE,

26:28.755 --> 26:30.623
BUT IF I TOOK IT,
I'D NEVER BE COMPLETELY SURE

26:30.657 --> 26:32.725
WHY I TOOK IT.

26:32.759 --> 26:36.062
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO HAVE THAT KIND
OF POWER OVER ME.

26:38.698 --> 26:41.868
WHERE DO YOU GET THE NERVE
TO TALK TO ME THIS WAY?

26:41.901 --> 26:44.671
AFTER WHAT YOU'VE
DONE TO MY FAMILY?

26:44.704 --> 26:46.305
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

26:46.338 --> 26:49.275
WELL, I DON'T ACCEPT
YOUR APOLOGY.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.277
YOU NEED TO GO.

26:51.310 --> 26:52.979
FOR THE SAKE OF
EVERYONE INVOLVED,

26:53.012 --> 26:54.814
YOU SHOULD SIMPLY LEAVE.

26:54.847 --> 26:58.417
IT'S LIKE THIS, BYRON.

26:58.450 --> 27:02.789
YOU THINK I'M THE KIND OF MAN
WHO WOULD TAKE THIS WAY OUT.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.624
AND I KNOW I'M NOT.

27:07.359 --> 27:11.664
WELL, WE COULD'VE RESOLVED
THIS AND MOVED ON,

27:11.698 --> 27:13.666
BUT APPARENTLY, EGO IS
GOING TO GET IN THE WAY.

27:16.703 --> 27:19.972
WHOSE EGO ARE
WE TALKING ABOUT?

27:43.262 --> 27:46.198
( phone beeps, rings out )

27:48.500 --> 27:51.170
ARIA, IT'S ME.

27:51.203 --> 27:55.307
CALL ME WHEN YOU CAN.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.308
I LOVE YOU.

27:56.342 --> 27:59.178
* SO THEN MY FRIEND

27:59.211 --> 28:02.114
* YOU'RE IN THE DEEP END

28:08.955 --> 28:12.825
* WELL, IT'S NEVER GOOD

28:12.859 --> 28:14.093
Maya: "I'M FINE, DON'T WORRY.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.895
I WON'T TAKE CHANCES,

28:15.928 --> 28:17.329
BECAUSE I'M NOT AS BRAVE
 AS YOU THINK I AM.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.397
YOU ARE THE BRAVE ONE."

28:18.430 --> 28:20.132
NO, I'M NOT.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.868
Maya: "YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
 I LOVE ABOUT YOU?

28:21.901 --> 28:24.036
YOU KNOW HOW TO BE STILL.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.838
IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING,

28:25.872 --> 28:28.507
AT A SWIM MEET WITH ALL THE
 CRAZINESS AND PRESSURE,

28:28.540 --> 28:30.777
I LOOK AT YOU
 AND YOU'RE STILL.

28:30.810 --> 28:33.880
I WISH I COULD DO THAT,

28:33.913 --> 28:36.182
BUT I'M IMPATIENT.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.484
I SHOULDN'T
 HAVE COME BACK.

28:38.517 --> 28:40.452
I SHOULD'VE JUST LEFT
 AND WE'D ALWAYS HAVE HAD

28:40.486 --> 28:45.091
THAT LAST NIGHT
 INSTEAD OF THIS MESS.

28:45.124 --> 28:48.861
I GUESS GOODBYES ARE THE ONLY
 PERFECT THINGS WE GET.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.030
DON'T TELL MY FOLKS.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.265
I'LL TALK TO THEM
 WHEN I'M READY.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.835
-- MAYA."

28:59.238 --> 29:01.473
* LET IT

29:01.507 --> 29:05.211
* PLAY OUT

29:05.244 --> 29:08.480
* I HOPE THAT THE SUN

29:08.514 --> 29:12.952
* I HOPE THAT THE SUN
FINDS YOU NOW *

29:16.222 --> 29:18.390
IS HE COMING BACK FOR THAT?

29:18.424 --> 29:22.194
NO, I'M TAKING IT OVER.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.562
DON'T GO IN THE HOUSE.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.431
JUST GIVE IT TO HIM
AND COME RIGHT BACK.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.367
MOM, WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.803
YOU HAVE TO DEAL
WITH WHAT'S HAPPENED.

29:30.837 --> 29:32.238
THIS IS HOW I CHOOSE
TO DEAL WITH IT.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.373
BY IGNORING IT?

29:34.406 --> 29:36.342
MAYBE IT'LL JUST GO AWAY?
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.544
LOOK, WE EACH KNOW LITTLE
CHUNKS OF THE TRUTH

29:38.577 --> 29:40.079
AND WE HAVE TO SHARE
WHAT WE KNOW,

29:40.112 --> 29:41.881
OTHERWISE THIS IS ALL
GONNA COME APART.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.415
COME APART.
IT'S GONNA BLOW APART.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.351
DO YOU THINK THAT
THAT BOY

29:45.384 --> 29:48.020
HAS THIS FAMILY'S
INTERESTS IN MIND?

29:48.054 --> 29:49.055
DO YOU?

29:51.057 --> 29:52.825
THAT BOY IS MY BROTHER.

29:52.859 --> 29:56.262
HE'S THE ONE WHO WANTS
TO BLOW THINGS UP.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.497
THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE
ALWAYS WANTED.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.166
YOUR FATHER AND I,

30:00.199 --> 30:02.501
WE'VE BEEN THE ONES WHO
HAVE KEPT THINGS TOGETHER.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.270
( sighs )

30:04.303 --> 30:06.572
DO NOT LISTEN TO JASON.

30:06.605 --> 30:09.008
DID DAD TELL YOU THAT I THOUGHT
HE WAS BEING BLACKMAILED?

30:10.910 --> 30:12.244
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

30:12.278 --> 30:15.014
YEAH, JASON FOUND MONEY.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.049
ALI HAD IT

30:17.083 --> 30:19.952
AND HE THOUGHT IT
WAS BECAUSE SHE KNEW
THAT DAD WAS HIS FATHER

30:19.986 --> 30:22.321
AND SHE WAS BLACKMAILING
HIM THAT SUMMER.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.056
YOU TALKED TO YOUR
FATHER ABOUT THIS?

30:24.090 --> 30:25.925
YES.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.593
AND WHAT DID HE SAY?

30:27.626 --> 30:30.329
HE DENIED IT.
AND I BELIEVED HIM.

30:30.362 --> 30:31.563
AND THEN I DIDN'T
BELIEVE HIM.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.232
AND THEN I LOOKED
IN THE CHECKBOOK

30:33.265 --> 30:34.867
AND I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS
TRUE AND HE TOLD ME

30:34.901 --> 30:37.103
THAT HE USED THE MONEY
TO PAY FOR A DETECTIVE.

30:37.136 --> 30:39.171
A DETECTIVE?

30:39.205 --> 30:41.607
YES, BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
THAT MELISS--

30:41.640 --> 30:43.642
DO YOU SEE?

30:43.675 --> 30:47.213
DO YOU SEE HOW THIS ALL JUST
SPINS AND FEEDS ON ITSELF?

30:51.918 --> 30:52.851
MOM?

30:55.487 --> 30:58.390
THE DETECTIVE WASN'T
YOUR FATHER'S IDEA.

30:58.424 --> 31:02.128
IT WAS MINE.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.240
NO, THE HOUSE WAS DARK,

31:14.273 --> 31:16.508
SO I JUST LEFT IT
ON THE BACK PORCH.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.946
THEN I CAME BACK HERE
AND I FOUND YOU LURKING
IN THE HYDRANGEAS.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.547
OKAY, I WAS NOT LURKING,

31:21.580 --> 31:24.383
I WAS JUST WORKING UP THE
NERVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT TOBY.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.485
( scoffs )

31:26.518 --> 31:28.187
DID I MESS IT
UP EVEN MORE?

31:28.220 --> 31:32.291
I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S
HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.560
I GUESS THERE WAS NOTHING
IMPORTANT IN THAT BAG?

31:34.593 --> 31:37.096
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE
THOUGH WE'D FIND.

31:37.129 --> 31:39.665
JUST A BUNCH OF KID STUFF.

31:39.698 --> 31:42.168
MAN, TIMES ARE TOUGH.

31:42.201 --> 31:45.437
MICHELE OBAMA WORE THIS
SAME BLOUSE TWO YEARS AGO.

31:45.471 --> 31:49.308
WAIT, WHERE DID
YOU GET THIS?

31:49.341 --> 31:51.377
I WAS SITTING ON IT.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.146
THAT STUFF IN THE BAG
WAS WRAPPED UP IN NEWSPAPER

31:54.180 --> 31:55.647
FROM JULY, 2009.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.516
SO?

31:57.549 --> 32:00.352
SO WE THOUGHT MAYA'S
PARENTS WRAPPED THAT
STUFF BUT ALI DID.

32:00.386 --> 32:03.189
BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.326
SPENCE, LOOK.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.230
YEAH, THIS ONE'S
HIGHLIGHTED TOO.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.265
WAIT, HANNA,

32:13.299 --> 32:15.401
GO THROUGH THE BACK YARD AND
THAT BAG OFF OF JASON'S PORCH.

32:15.434 --> 32:16.635
I'M GONNA CALL
ARIA AND EMILY.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.170
DID SOMETHING JUST HAPPEN?

32:18.204 --> 32:19.738
WE WERE LOOKING
IN THE BAG FOR CLUES

32:19.771 --> 32:21.974
BUT WE SHOULD'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT THE WHOLE BAG AS A CLUE.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.417
YOU WERE TRYING
TO BUY HIM OFF.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.751
HOW DID YOU THINK
HE WOULD REACT?

32:32.784 --> 32:34.186
YOU SOUND VERY CLOSE
TO DEFENDING HIM.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.288
I'M NOT DEFENDING ANYONE,
BELIEVE ME.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.424
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO ACCOMPLISH

32:38.457 --> 32:39.992
BY STRONG-ARMING HIM.

32:40.026 --> 32:41.460
STRONG-ARMING?

32:41.493 --> 32:43.029
A DREAM WITH HOUSING?

32:43.062 --> 32:44.463
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL
STRONG-ARMING?

32:44.496 --> 32:46.598
YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN
WHAT HE WAS GONNA DO.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.267
WHEN I TALKED TO HIM--
WHA--?

32:48.300 --> 32:50.069
WAIT, YOU TALKED TO EZRA?

32:50.102 --> 32:51.737
YES, I DID.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.039
IT IS POSSIBLE
TO COMMUNICATE

32:53.072 --> 32:54.506
WITH SOMETHING OTHER
THAN THREATS.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.508
SO HE WAS GETTING
MIXED SIGNALS FROM US.

32:56.542 --> 33:00.246
THIS FAMILY INVENTED
MIXED SIGNALS.

33:00.279 --> 33:05.017
WELL, HE'S TALKED TO SCHAFFER
BY NOW AND TURNED HIM DOWN.

33:05.051 --> 33:06.585
IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.487
WHAT IS OUT OF YOUR HANDS?

33:08.520 --> 33:11.557
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT THE WAY I'M
HANDLING THIS SITUATION.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.359
YEAH, IT'S COMPLICATED.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.294
WELL, MAYBE WE'RE
MAKING IT COMPLICATED

33:15.327 --> 33:17.029
WHEN THE ANSWER
IS REALLY SIMPLE

33:17.063 --> 33:18.564
AND RIGHT IN FRONT
OF US.

33:18.597 --> 33:22.234
IT WILL NOT BE SO SIMPLE
IF SHE RUNS AWAY OR ELOPES.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.670
I DON'T WANT ARIA WITH HIM
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO,

33:24.703 --> 33:26.405
BUT IF YOU BACK HIM
INTO A CORNER,

33:26.438 --> 33:29.108
NOBODY WILL END UP HAPPY.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.199
( clanking, rattling )

34:09.148 --> 34:10.449
( panting )

34:10.482 --> 34:11.650
JENNA!

34:11.683 --> 34:13.652
( coughing )

34:19.125 --> 34:21.493
HANNA!
HANNA!

34:23.661 --> 34:26.532
( coughing )

34:26.565 --> 34:27.699
YOU OKAY?

34:27.733 --> 34:29.235
FINE, JUST GET HER DOWN.

34:29.268 --> 34:32.070
I GOT IT.

34:51.922 --> 34:55.327
TOBY?
I'M HERE.

35:01.300 --> 35:04.236
A HOSPITAL?
YOU'RE OKAY.

35:04.270 --> 35:08.307
WAS THERE A FIRE?

35:08.340 --> 35:10.209
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHERE YOU WERE?

35:10.242 --> 35:13.379
UM, I-- I GOT A TEXT.

35:13.412 --> 35:16.615
I LISTENED.
IT WAS FROM JASON.

35:16.648 --> 35:19.718
HE SAID HE HAD
TO TALK TO ME.

35:19.751 --> 35:23.155
YOU WERE GONE,
SO I TOOK A CAB.

35:23.189 --> 35:27.726
I RANG THE DOORBELL,
SOMEONE OPENED IT, AND...

35:30.929 --> 35:33.665
THAT'S ALL I CAN REMEMBER.

35:33.699 --> 35:38.370
DID JASON'S HOUSE
CATCH ON FIRE?

35:38.404 --> 35:40.406
YES.

35:40.439 --> 35:43.275
( gasps )
I WOKE UP IN THAT PLACE.

35:43.309 --> 35:46.478
AND-- AND I COULDN'T SEE.

35:46.512 --> 35:49.515
AND THERE WAS SMOKE
IN MY THROAT.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.683
HOW DID I GET OUT, TOBY?

35:51.717 --> 35:53.752
DID JASON GET ME OUT?

35:55.354 --> 35:58.924
NO.

35:58.957 --> 36:02.194
IT WAS HANNA MARIN
WHO GOT YOU OUT.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.501
WAIT, SO HE FLEW
HER ON A PLANE?

36:09.535 --> 36:12.871
FROM HILTON HEAD
TO AN AIRSTRIP
OUTSIDE PHILADELPHIA.

36:12.904 --> 36:15.774
WHAT ABOUT THE BUS RIDE
FROM HER GRANDMOTHER'S?

36:15.807 --> 36:17.609
WE NEVER ACTUALLY SAW HER
GET OFF THE BUS.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.211
WE ONLY SAW HER
GET OUT OF THE CAB.

36:19.245 --> 36:20.646
SHE COULD'VE BEEN IN ROSEWOOD
HOURS BEFORE THAT.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.747
DOING WHAT?

36:21.780 --> 36:24.516
HANNA!

36:24.550 --> 36:27.286
WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

36:27.319 --> 36:29.888
NO, I'M FINE, I JUST
NEED TO WASH MY HAIR.

36:29.921 --> 36:32.491
I'M ALL SMOKY.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.569
( soft groan )

36:43.602 --> 36:44.970
DID YOU GET THIS
IN THE FIRE?

36:45.003 --> 36:49.241
THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT
I NEEDED ON THE PORCH.

36:49.275 --> 36:51.343
AND THERE WAS GLASS.

36:51.377 --> 36:53.745
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA NEED STITCHES.

36:53.779 --> 36:57.015
SO, I JUST CLEAN THIS UP,
PUT A DRESSING ON IT,

36:57.048 --> 36:59.285
AND SEND YOU HOME
WITH SOME ANTIBIOTICS.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.920
THANK YOU.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.296
HOW'S MELISSA?

37:10.329 --> 37:13.799
UM, SHE'S IN PHILADELPHIA.

37:13.832 --> 37:16.935
OH. I SEE THAT
THE CARPENTER IS BACK.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.937
AND HIS SISTER.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.606
SHE'S NOT WHAT
I WAS EXPECTING.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.374
WHAT WAS SHE DOING
IN THAT HOUSE BY HERSELF?

37:22.408 --> 37:23.642
I DON'T KNOW.

37:23.675 --> 37:26.678
SPENCER, I HATE
TO BREAK THIS TO YOU,

37:26.712 --> 37:28.947
BUT YOU HAVE A VERY
COMPLICATED LIFE.

37:28.980 --> 37:32.684
( laughs ) IS THAT
YOUR MEDICAL OPINION?

37:32.718 --> 37:34.853
YES. YES, IT IS, ACTUALLY.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.789
WELL, THE CONDITION
IS HEREDITARY,

37:37.823 --> 37:40.058
SO THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH
I CAN DO ABOUT IT, I'M AFRAID.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.661
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
DON'T BE SO CERTAIN OF THAT,

37:42.694 --> 37:45.864
'CAUSE MODERN MEDICINE'S MADE
GREAT ADVANCES IN THIS FIELD.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.468
YOU HAVE TO AGREE,

37:49.501 --> 37:51.937
FATE KEEPS SHOVING US
INTO THE SAME PATH.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.475
DON'T CONFUSE
FATE WITH JUST...

37:58.377 --> 38:00.579
REALLY BAD LUCK.

38:02.914 --> 38:06.385
AS MUCH AS I HATE TO DO THIS,

38:06.418 --> 38:08.887
I HAVE TO ASK YOU
A DIRECT QUESTION.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.461
DO YOU WANT TO AGREE
THAT CERTAIN THINGS

38:15.494 --> 38:17.629
BETWEEN US NEVER HAPPENED?

38:19.130 --> 38:22.834
NO.

38:22.868 --> 38:25.371
I WOULDN'T TAKE
BACK ANYTHING.

38:41.653 --> 38:44.122
WHAT WAS JENNA
DOING IN MY HOUSE?

38:44.155 --> 38:45.624
DON'T YOU KNOW?

38:45.657 --> 38:48.594
NO. I WAS HALFWAY
TO SCRANTON

38:48.627 --> 38:49.695
THEN I GOT A CALL
FROM THE POLICE

38:49.728 --> 38:50.929
SAYING THERE
HAD BEEN A FIRE.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.131
HOW BAD WAS IT?

38:53.164 --> 38:57.135
FIRST FLOOR IS PRETTY MUCH
DAMAGED IN THE BACK,

38:57.168 --> 39:00.672
BUT I WON'T REALLY KNOW
MUCH ELSE TILL MORNING.

39:02.073 --> 39:05.343
I'M SO SORRY.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.916
I SHOULD PROBABLY GO
TALK TO SPENCER'S MOM.

39:14.586 --> 39:17.723
( inaudible )

39:17.756 --> 39:21.993
* SO IT DIDN'T GO TO PLAN

39:22.027 --> 39:25.130
* IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND

39:25.163 --> 39:30.001
* THAT NOW I KNOW
THIS IS JUST OUR STORY *

39:30.035 --> 39:34.005
* I WILL SET OUT ON MY WAY

39:34.039 --> 39:37.409
* YOU'RE NEVER IN ONE PLACE

39:37.443 --> 39:39.811
* AND NOW I CAN LEARN TO WALK

39:39.845 --> 39:43.515
HI. MRS. ST. GERMAIN.
IT'S EMILY.

39:43.549 --> 39:46.585
I WANTED TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT MAYA.

39:46.618 --> 39:50.689
I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED
AND I THINK SHE'S OKAY.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.425
NO, BUT I HEARD FROM HER.

39:53.459 --> 39:55.894
I GOT AN EMAIL.

39:58.096 --> 40:01.700
* WE CAN THROW
THE PAST AWAY NOW *

40:01.733 --> 40:04.936
* 'CAUSE WE DON'T
NEED IT ANYMORE *

40:04.970 --> 40:07.673
* ONE DAY AT A TIME

40:07.706 --> 40:10.609
* 'CAUSE I STILL BELIEVE

40:10.642 --> 40:12.478
* THAT IT'S OURS
FOR THE TAKING *

40:12.511 --> 40:16.848
SPENCER, JENNA WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.717
ALL OF YOU.

40:20.652 --> 40:22.621
OKAY.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.422
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:26.024 --> 40:29.160
( sighs )
I THINK SO.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.062
* ONE DAY AT A TIME

40:31.096 --> 40:34.466
JASON WAS MILES AWAY
WHEN THE POLICE CALLED HIM.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.635
HE DIDN'T SEND
YOU THAT TEXT.

40:36.668 --> 40:37.936
SOMEBODY DID.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.571
ANY ONE OF US.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.873
YOU CAN'T BLAME
THIS ON US.

40:44.510 --> 40:48.246
( sobs )
I DON'T.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.650
( sobbing continues )

40:53.752 --> 40:55.487
YOU SHOULD GO.

40:59.224 --> 41:00.659
WAIT.

41:02.093 --> 41:04.530
HANNA, ARE YOU THERE?

41:04.563 --> 41:06.832
I'M HERE.

41:06.865 --> 41:10.068
TOBY SAID THAT YOU WERE
THE ONE THAT DRAGGED ME OUT.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.604
IS THAT RIGHT?

41:12.638 --> 41:16.808
YEAH. THAT WAS ME.

41:19.678 --> 41:23.582
WHY?

41:25.984 --> 41:27.986
YOU'RE WELCOME.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.228
Emily:
THERE ALL FROM THAT SUMMER.

41:37.262 --> 41:39.731
Spencer:
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME KIND OF KEY.

41:39.765 --> 41:41.767
WE'RE THE KEY.

41:41.800 --> 41:45.270
ALI SAID WE KNOW MORE
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THAN WE THINK WE DO.

41:45.303 --> 41:47.573
WHO TRICKED JENNA
INTO THAT HOUSE?

41:47.606 --> 41:51.577
IF IT WAS ANYBODY BUT JENNA,
I THINK IT'D BE "A".

41:51.610 --> 41:54.279
GARRETT CAN'T BE HAPPY
THAT TOBY'S BACK IN
THAT HOUSE WITH JENNA.

41:54.312 --> 41:57.215
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO DIE
IN THERE, WASN'T SHE?

42:06.992 --> 42:09.661
( chime plays, stops )

42:09.695 --> 42:11.329
THAT'S EVERYTHING.

42:11.362 --> 42:12.864
NO, IT'S NOT.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.805
DOES ANYBODY RECOGNIZE THIS?

42:19.838 --> 42:21.139
IS THERE ANYTHING
ON THE BACK?

42:21.172 --> 42:23.141
YEAH, NUMBER 1.

42:23.174 --> 42:25.110
IT'S JUST HALF A POSTCARD.

42:25.143 --> 42:26.812
HOW DO WE FIND OUT
WHERE IT'S FROM?

42:26.845 --> 42:27.946
YEAH, WHERE'S
THE OTHER HALF?

42:29.981 --> 42:32.784
WAIT, THIS ISN'T FROM JULY,
IT'S FROM THE END OF AUGUST.

42:32.818 --> 42:34.252
LOOK.

42:34.285 --> 42:37.689
IT'S-- IT'S LABOR DAY EVENTS
FROM PHILADELPHIA,

42:37.723 --> 42:40.992
BROOKHAVEN AND...

42:41.026 --> 42:42.961
ROSEWOOD.

42:42.994 --> 42:46.364
WHEN DID DUNCAN SAY HE LEFT
ALI AT THE AIRFIELD?

42:46.397 --> 42:48.366
BEFORE NOON ON SUNDAY.

42:48.399 --> 42:51.703
WELL, IS THIS WHERE SHE
WAS WHEN WE THOUGHT SHE
WAS ON THAT BUS?

42:51.737 --> 42:54.339
Spencer: WHO DID
SHE PLAN ON MEETING?

42:54.372 --> 42:58.309
( Fur Elise plays slowly )
