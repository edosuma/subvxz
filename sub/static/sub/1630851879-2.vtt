He was in huge debt

He had no transaction record
because he had such bad credit.

They've checked all the security cameras
in the mountain just in case,

of him coming here,

28:58.610 --> 29:01.250

closed the case a year ago?

29:15.150 --> 29:16.330
Because they're dumb?

29:17.040 --> 29:19.900
No. It's because they weren't sure
that he came to Mount Jirisan.

29:20.870 --> 29:23.680
He took a restricted path,
so he wasn't on the security camera.

29:24.020 --> 29:26.540
