00:27.110 --> 00:29.320
<i>Previously on "Johnny Test"…</i>

00:29.404 --> 00:31.865
<i>After seeing a picture</i>
<i>of cute baby Johnny,</i>

00:31.948 --> 00:34.451
<i>Susan and Mary</i>
<i>decided to build a Baby-Bot</i>

00:34.534 --> 00:38.621
<i>since they were too young to remember</i>
<i>the joys of having a baby brother,</i>

00:38.705 --> 00:43.334
<i>and the baby was perfect</i>
<i>and did the usual adorable baby things…</i>

00:43.418 --> 00:45.211
<i>like getting Johnny locked away,</i>

00:45.295 --> 00:46.880
<i>stealing a wad of jewels,</i>

00:46.963 --> 00:50.508
<i>and trying to destroy</i>
<i>the entire Test family.</i>

00:50.592 --> 00:54.053
<i>Anyway, Johnny stopped the Baby-Bot</i>
<i>from living a happy life</i>

00:54.137 --> 00:55.680
<i>in a prosthetic metal body,</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:59.350
<i>then sent it to military school</i>
<i>2,000 miles away,</i>

00:59.434 --> 01:01.311
<i>which wrapped up the story.</i>

01:01.394 --> 01:04.314
-<i>That is…</i>

01:04.397 --> 01:06.399
until it escaped.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.944
<i>Then, blah, blah, blah, it walked</i>
<i>day after day back to Porkbelly</i>

01:10.028 --> 01:13.907
<i>to get revenge on his big brother,</i>
<i>Johnny Test.</i>

01:13.990 --> 01:16.451
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

01:16.534 --> 01:19.079
<i>Yes, this </i>is <i>gonna be fun!</i>

01:20.205 --> 01:21.831
Wait, who are you?

01:21.915 --> 01:25.126
Me? I'm a vegan alien
getting my revenge on Johnny

01:25.210 --> 01:27.087
for trapping me on this wretched planet.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.297
Uh, that's what I'm doing.

01:29.380 --> 01:32.717
Except I'm a Baby-Bot
that he banished to military school.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.638
Oh, well, how about we kick for it
to see who gets revenge first?

01:36.721 --> 01:38.973
Don't you mean… flip for it?

01:39.057 --> 01:40.475
No!

01:44.604 --> 01:46.022
Not bad.

01:48.149 --> 01:51.528
Now… revenge time.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.075
What do you mean
you're getting rid of all this stuff?

01:57.158 --> 01:59.285
I haven't even tried
the Mind Erase Zapper yet.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.038
I haven't even tried the Mind Erase--

02:02.122 --> 02:04.415
We're gonna use them for parts.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.961
So we can finally help the Dad-a-maton
become more mobile,

02:08.044 --> 02:10.922
since we sent him
to that desert island…

02:12.632 --> 02:14.592
- …with only a head.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.266
OK, is it me,
or do they not look happy today?

02:21.349 --> 02:22.851
Imagine that.

02:22.934 --> 02:27.021
Something created in this lab
is unhappy…

02:29.232 --> 02:32.735
after you send it
thousands of miles away.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.612
Baby-Brother-Bot?

02:34.696 --> 02:38.741
Guess who escaped military school
and wants revenge?

02:38.825 --> 02:40.201
It's him, right?

02:42.704 --> 02:45.665
Now… where's Mom and Dad?

02:45.748 --> 02:49.252
I want to have a chat, face-to-face.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.756
You will care for me and play with me

02:53.840 --> 02:56.259
and love me way more than Johnny.

02:56.342 --> 03:01.890
We love you, Baby-Bot,
and so much more than you, Johnny.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.559
OK, I know they're hypnotized,
but that still hurt.

03:04.642 --> 03:09.188
Oh, you have not yet begun to feel
the pain of my revenge, Johnny Test.

03:10.106 --> 03:13.484
Because now you are going
to take your baby brother

03:13.568 --> 03:15.403
out for a stroll.

03:15.486 --> 03:18.239
But that sounds nice, not revengey.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.993
Up the steepest hill in Porkbelly.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.620
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.330
Well, if you don't…

03:28.416 --> 03:32.295
…I'll erase every memory
they have of Johnny Test,

03:32.378 --> 03:34.255
so you won't have a Mom and Dad,

03:34.339 --> 03:38.426
like I didn't for 297 days
in military school.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.180
Now, I want that walk.

03:42.263 --> 03:45.016
You know where you're pulling
that stuff from, right?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.939
Push me!

03:51.689 --> 03:54.234
Can this day get any worse?

03:56.277 --> 03:59.030
Oh, this is going to be fun!

04:02.617 --> 04:03.743
Johnny Test!

04:03.826 --> 04:07.372
After repeatedly stopping
my attempts to rule the world,

04:07.455 --> 04:09.374
which of course gets me sent to jail,

04:09.457 --> 04:11.918
I am here to get revenge!

04:13.044 --> 04:15.255
Yeah, well, get in line, Mittens.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.174
My evil baby brother-bot's
getting revenge right now.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.593
You have an evil baby brother?

04:20.677 --> 04:23.179
Well, let me take a peek
at the little tyke.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.265
Careful, he's got a full diaper.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.016
Oh, like you mean it's full of…

04:30.561 --> 04:31.479
Danger.

04:32.522 --> 04:35.942
I will pass on greeting the child.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.073
The baby got you too, huh?

04:46.411 --> 04:50.123
How can a baby be this hard
to push up a hill?

04:52.542 --> 04:55.962
Because I'm 259 pounds
of tech and titanium,

04:56.045 --> 04:59.549
not weak skin and bones, like you mortals.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.554
Um, I didn't tell you to stop.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.682
Now take me back down the hill
and push me back up…

05:07.765 --> 05:10.059
20 more times!

05:10.143 --> 05:15.148
Yes, it's definitely time
to go down the hill!

05:15.231 --> 05:16.691
Run.

05:16.774 --> 05:20.236
OK, now we race home,
un-stun Susan and Mary,

05:20.320 --> 05:23.406
and figure out a way to stop that bot!

05:28.411 --> 05:31.873
Then, when we stop him,
we send him back to military school,

05:31.956 --> 05:33.666
or maybe Mars!

05:33.750 --> 05:37.045
I like the Mars thing.
And… do you hear something?

05:37.128 --> 05:39.422
How much can he fit
in that diaper?

05:43.217 --> 05:44.844
Oh, this is going to be fun.

05:46.721 --> 05:51.768
Johnny Test, it is I, the Brain Freezer!

05:51.851 --> 05:55.104
Prepare to feel the cool wrath of my--

05:55.188 --> 05:58.483
Not now, Brain Freezer, I'm dealing
with my baby brother's revenge!

05:58.566 --> 05:59.692
Baby brother?

06:01.277 --> 06:03.946
I didn't know you had
a little baby brother.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.907
Oh, he's so cute!

06:05.990 --> 06:07.450
Wait, where did he get the--

06:13.581 --> 06:14.874
What just happened?

06:14.957 --> 06:17.293
<i>None of us</i>
<i>can get revenge on Johnny.</i>

06:17.376 --> 06:20.963
Yeah, because this baby thing
is hogging all our revenge time!

06:22.840 --> 06:25.676
Ooh, sounds like the kid's
got a net-launcher, too!

06:28.137 --> 06:31.349
That's a smart, good, amazing baby!

06:31.432 --> 06:34.268
We love you
so much more than Johnny,

06:34.352 --> 06:36.020
who is not smart.

06:40.983 --> 06:45.321
Now it's special
better-than-Johnny Baby-Bottle time.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.579
Now it's time to burp the baby I love,

06:53.663 --> 06:56.582
and not loathe, like I do Johnny.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.752
That's it, get a burp out,

06:59.836 --> 07:02.839
or a big spit-up.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.174
Scooch! Scooch your butt, Dog.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.593
I'm trying.
But you stink at scooching!

07:07.677 --> 07:10.221
I stink at scooching?
You stink at scooching!

07:15.143 --> 07:17.895
Wow… that baby is good.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.480
Very good.

07:19.564 --> 07:23.401
It's weird, but I think a part of me,
a very small part of me,

07:23.484 --> 07:25.736
is feeling sorry for Johnny.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.071
Well, I'm not.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.825
Well, maybe a little.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.619
I've always liked Master Johnny.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.584
Now sing me the lullaby I wrote.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.795
Why? You're a robot.
You don't need sleep.

07:42.879 --> 07:46.466
Sing me the cutesy baby song,
or you know what.

07:47.508 --> 07:50.303
Johnny, sing to your baby brother.

07:50.386 --> 07:53.681
Cos he's so much better than you.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.411
He fell asleep!

08:15.495 --> 08:16.996
Quick, get him to the window!

08:23.377 --> 08:28.049
Uh-oh. Did Johnny stop
da widdle baby's wevenge?

08:30.384 --> 08:33.346
Grab a lemonade
and join the club, Pee-Wee.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.556
Aw, don't cry, baby.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.725
Johnny beats all of us.

08:40.937 --> 08:44.815
Because you don't have the guts
to take revenge all the way.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.865
But <i>I </i>do.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.327
OK, that kid is on a whole other level.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.163
Hurry up!

08:59.247 --> 09:00.790
Let's try… this one.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.709
Gaah! No. Um…

09:06.045 --> 09:07.713
No.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.675
Now they're cheese.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.134
No.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.763
We gotta stop Baby-Bot,
who we flung out a window

09:15.846 --> 09:17.640
but is surely coming back.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.434
We can short his batteries
with this jammer.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.021
And we'll launch the pulse
as soon as he opens the front--

09:26.023 --> 09:30.027
-Huh.
-I realized the perfect revenge.

09:30.111 --> 09:34.198
It's just me alone with my mom and dad,
and no brother,

09:34.282 --> 09:36.450
or sisters, or pets.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.328
Oh, that sounds nice.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.955
I hate Johnny!

09:42.081 --> 09:45.167
Now… time to say night-night.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.588
-What the…?

09:48.671 --> 09:51.716
You need to chill out, Baby-Bot.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.139
Or somebody could get hurt.

09:59.056 --> 10:02.602
And it will be all of you,
because nothing can stop--

10:06.022 --> 10:10.318
We thought someone
could use a diaper change.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.902
Yep!

10:11.986 --> 10:13.279
You think it ends here?

10:13.362 --> 10:14.697
Look at them.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.658
They never stop trying
to get revenge on Johnny Test.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.410
He's not wrong.

10:19.493 --> 10:22.705
We only saved you
so we can have the satisfaction

10:22.788 --> 10:24.749
of destroying you, Johnny Test.

10:24.832 --> 10:27.335
That, and the kid freaked us out.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.714
But you said your revenge
was to be alone with Mom and Dad,

10:31.797 --> 10:33.466
and no siblings or pets.

10:33.549 --> 10:36.761
Well, yeah, but you're gonna
have to give me my diaper back

10:36.844 --> 10:38.888
so I can destroy all of you.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.099
Actually, there is another way.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.728
<i>Whee!</i>

10:46.646 --> 10:49.023
Well, the Mom-a-maton
sure seems happier.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.608
And so does Baby-Bot.

10:50.691 --> 10:54.153
And hopefully Dad-a-maton
will like his new mobility.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.323
Yeah…

10:57.406 --> 10:59.950
we really gotta get that guy
a body someday.
