00:01.468 --> 00:04.470
   Joshua: <i> In the beginning,</i>
    <i> a star fell from heaven</i>

00:04.471 --> 00:06.205
        <i> And changed us.</i>

00:06.207 --> 00:09.475
         <i> Made us angels</i>
   <i> and gave us a new destiny:</i>

00:09.477 --> 00:12.644
     <i> To stop the apocalypse</i>

00:12.646 --> 00:15.581
     <i> And the devil himself.</i>

00:15.583 --> 00:17.416
    <i> We must pass god's test</i>

00:17.418 --> 00:21.587
       <i> And prove humanity</i>
     <i> is still worth saving.</i>

00:21.589 --> 00:23.722
   <i> For we are the messengers.</i>

00:27.361 --> 00:29.661
<i>Previously on</i> the messengers...

00:29.663 --> 00:31.764
   The messengers are failing
  for one undeniable reason--

00:31.766 --> 00:34.166
 <i> Rose is the horseman of death.</i>

00:34.168 --> 00:36.101
Rose has everything
under control.

00:36.103 --> 00:38.670
Anyone interfering
with our plans

00:38.672 --> 00:40.072
      <i> Is being dealt with.</i>

00:44.512 --> 00:46.378
 We can't save him-- he's dead.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.579
                 I can bring him
             back from the dead.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.685
             Vera:
            Joshua!

00:53.687 --> 00:55.687
    Joshua: <i> These brothers,</i>
   <i> they're not just farmers.</i>

00:55.689 --> 00:57.589
          <i> I'm worried,</i>
<i>if they launch this technology,</i>

00:57.591 --> 00:59.892
They're gonna
break another seal.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.194
 Cindy: The meteorite contains
  every element known to man,

01:02.196 --> 01:04.563
            <i> Plus one</i>
    <i> we've never seen before.</i>

01:04.565 --> 01:06.799
 Simon: <i> No matter what we try,</i>
      <i> it ends in disaster.</i>

01:10.671 --> 01:12.538
               Oh, i think we're
                 well on our way

01:12.540 --> 01:15.607
To creating the most destructive
weapon the world has ever known.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.612
                           Vera:
                           Alan.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.748
        (metal crunches)

01:28.589 --> 01:30.756
This is not good.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.759
This is definitely
not good.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.766
Hey, stop!

01:41.602 --> 01:42.634
                            Hey!

01:44.438 --> 01:45.504
                      Hey, stop!

01:51.479 --> 01:53.612
           (coughing)

01:56.450 --> 01:57.649
              Hey!

01:57.651 --> 01:58.750
           Somebody!

02:00.688 --> 02:01.753
              Hey!

02:06.894 --> 02:08.259
           (screams)

02:31.652 --> 02:34.586
          Tomorrow, these drones
         will take to the skies,

02:34.588 --> 02:38.323
Seeding the clouds over
this drought-stricken valley.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.626
                  Now, the smart
                 rain will fall,

02:40.628 --> 02:42.594
            The crops will grow,

02:42.596 --> 02:44.796
               Bringing life
                 to this...

02:48.202 --> 02:49.935
    ...To this hungry world.
        (clears throat)

02:51.405 --> 02:53.405
I don't know about you, brother,
        but i'm looking

02:53.407 --> 02:55.908
  At some pretty hungry faces
           right now.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.943
So what do you say

02:57.945 --> 03:00.546
We get this celebration started?

03:04.685 --> 03:05.884
   This isn't gonna be easy.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.861
        We're gonna need
    some good cover stories.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.665
All right, look, there are a lot
of reporters and farmers here.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.933
So we just try
to blend in.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.601
Join one of
the interview pools,

03:22.603 --> 03:24.236
Maybe take one
of the tours.
                     He's right.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.238
        Whatever it takes to get
       close to vincent and mark

03:26.240 --> 03:28.490
       To figure out which one's
            gonna be a horseman.

03:28.491 --> 03:30.741
         Are you sure it's gonna
       be one of these two guys?
                       I am.

03:33.747 --> 03:36.748
   I believe the launch of smart
        rain is gonna be the sin

03:36.750 --> 03:38.700
                 That breaks the
        horseman of famine seal.

03:38.701 --> 03:40.651
      We got to figure out which
      brother's gonna launch it,

03:40.654 --> 03:41.787
             Talk him out of it.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.589
                  Waste of time,
                  if you ask me.

03:43.591 --> 03:44.957
 Well, you have a better idea?

03:44.959 --> 03:46.925
 Yeah, i say we kill them both.

03:57.238 --> 03:58.570
             Erin:
     You can't be serious.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.972
              Koa:
       I am dead serious.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.740
 She's right.
                    What?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.775
      Raul.
Think about it--
this is the fourth horseman.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.577
  Millions of people could die
        if he's allowed

04:05.579 --> 04:06.995
                    To break his
                     seal-- best

04:06.996 --> 04:08.412
To kill him now
and make sure he doesn't.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.749
We're messengers, chosen by god.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.950
  We're not supposed to kill.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.819
          Maybe we should start.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.521
If we kill them both,

04:16.523 --> 04:18.724
We'll be killing an innocent man
along with the horseman.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.559
                Erin: They could
               both be innocent.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.262
 The only thing we have to go on
 right now are joshua's visions.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.863
There's no hard
evidence yet.

04:24.865 --> 04:25.764
                  Is that really
                 worth the risk?

04:25.766 --> 04:26.832
          Absolutely.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.836
       Now, hear me out.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.321
       After all, we want
        the same thing--

04:32.322 --> 04:33.805
         (whispering):
   To prevent the apocalypse.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.541
You're the one trying to help
the horsemen break their seals.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.210
          Not anymore.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.878
I admit, i did try to talk them
     into working with me.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.014
       I thought we could
         have some fun,

04:42.016 --> 04:44.549
       Start a few wars,
 maybe a plague here and there,

04:44.551 --> 04:45.884
  Not destroy all of mankind,

04:45.886 --> 04:47.953
        Which is exactly
   what they're trying to do.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.524
  And just like us, they want
    nothing to do with you.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.859
   Don't be so shortsighted.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.160
  If you and i work together,

04:55.161 --> 04:56.460
       I know we can stop
      the fourth horseman.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.897
No way we're working
with you.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.032
                     How can you
                  say that, koa?

05:01.869 --> 05:03.402
                  After all i've
                   done for you.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.572
                How is your bank
              statement looking?

05:10.010 --> 05:12.010
         And you, raul.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.879
You haven't even
thanked me yet.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.547
               I don't know what
           you're talking about.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.882
The letter
you received.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.651
            Joshua:
    We don't need your help.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.919
                 We can stop the
           horseman without you.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.654
Like you stopped
the last three?

05:23.924 --> 05:25.924
      Rose and the others
      are still out there.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.659
And they'll do whatever it takes

05:27.661 --> 05:29.494
          To make sure
   the fourth seal is broken,

05:29.496 --> 05:32.764
    Which is why you must do
whatever it takes to stop them.

05:32.766 --> 05:33.899
    Because once they unite,

05:33.901 --> 05:36.101
     Their power will grow
         even stronger.

05:36.103 --> 05:39.037
       (cell phone rings)

05:39.940 --> 05:41.606
It's vera.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.843
 Hey, where are you?

05:44.845 --> 05:46.378
      I don't know, okay?
         Some junkyard.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.879
   Listen, my phone is about
            to die.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.881
      I'm headed to a town
         called smyrna.

05:49.883 --> 05:50.882
What did you say?

05:50.884 --> 05:51.883
You're breaking up.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.285
            Smyrna.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.686
    Th-there's a power plant
          there, okay?

05:54.688 --> 05:56.822
 (reception breaking): Joshua,
listen, alan has been kidnapped,

05:56.824 --> 05:58.690
         And i think...

05:58.692 --> 06:00.425
    Vera.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.728
             Jo...

06:02.730 --> 06:03.729
 (phone indicates dropped call)

06:03.731 --> 06:05.397
            Damn it!

06:05.399 --> 06:06.398
       What did she say?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.866
                  All i heard is

06:07.868 --> 06:09.735
       That she's headed to some
            place called smyrna,

06:09.737 --> 06:11.403
             And it sounded like
        alan had been kidnapped.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.738
          Vera and alan need us.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.840
             So let's kill these
         brothers and get going.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.142
Wait, smart rain doesn't launch
till tomorrow afternoon.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.144
    We still have time to figure
this out without shedding blood.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.712
          He's right.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.381
       Let's stick to the
      original plan, okay?

06:22.383 --> 06:23.849
      You and i can still
         go after mark.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.684
           And i'll s-see what i
           can get from vincent.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.853
Peter, you and koa
go help vera.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.020
                   Yeah.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.889
            Send me away to keep
           me from killing them.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.725
Your gifts may be of more use
to vera than they are to us.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.128
    He's right.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.629
We should get going.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.070
You know what needs
to be done.

06:49.877 --> 06:52.177
The letter the devil mentioned,
what was he talking about?

06:52.179 --> 06:53.545
Did he do something
for you?

06:53.547 --> 06:55.013
                 No.
Raul.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.548
                     Erin, don't
                 worry about it.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.049
Don't...? You're giving me
a lot to worry about here.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.050
                     What's that
               supposed to mean?

06:59.052 --> 07:00.552
          It means...

07:00.554 --> 07:02.020
           It means that when we
      finally find mark plowman,

07:02.022 --> 07:03.989
       I need to know you're not
         gonna do anything rash.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.957
Nothing about this
is rash.
                     Oh, really?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.959
      So if we all agree to kill
           the plowman brothers,

07:07.961 --> 07:09.828
                Who's gonna pull
               the trigger? You?

07:09.829 --> 07:11.696
        This isn't self-defense,
              it's an execution.

07:11.698 --> 07:12.864
I know exactly
what it is.

07:12.866 --> 07:13.932
                     Oh, really?

07:13.934 --> 07:14.966
                     You've done
                    this before?

07:14.968 --> 07:16.468
You know that scar?

07:16.470 --> 07:17.969
The one that i told amy was
from a polar bear?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.971
                      Yeah.
I got that
five years ago.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.640
One day, el jefe comes
to me, tells me

07:21.642 --> 07:22.908
He wants me to kill
one of his lieutenants.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.810
Said that he's
undermining the cartel.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.812
But i didn't want to do it,
you know why?

07:26.814 --> 07:28.814
Because i thought
the guy was innocent.

07:28.816 --> 07:32.484
Till he comes after me with a
machete and damn near kills me.

07:32.486 --> 07:35.821
I was lucky
to kill him first.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.022
So lesson learned.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.156
You hesitate,
you die.

07:38.158 --> 07:41.159
             Mark:
 Okay, that concludes the tour.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.195
                   I hope it was
                  informative...

07:44.164 --> 07:45.764
               I've got an idea.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.738
Take good care
of it, boy.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.207
                        Will do.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.114
Need a ride?

08:05.185 --> 08:06.251
        Okay.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.187
So i found it.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.189
Smyrna, california.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.025
Population: 66.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.661
Weird-- there's only
a couple of buildings.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.929
Like an industrial
ghost town.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.599
The power plant looks like
the only one intact.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.933
Maybe vera's there.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.235
    What's wrong?

08:23.237 --> 08:26.071
            Nothing, i'm just...

08:30.978 --> 08:32.844
            I've been forgetting
                  things lately.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.847
                 Names, memories
                of my childhood.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.851
            Joshua says it could
           be a cost of my gift.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.120
               Makes me not want
              to use it so much.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.256
Well, it might not
be permanent.

08:44.258 --> 08:46.157
Eliza said
the costs will go away

08:46.159 --> 08:48.026
Once all seven messengers
are united.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.862
    Yeah, well, now that we know
         rose isn't a messenger,

08:50.864 --> 08:52.531
          Leaves only six of us.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.965
For now.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.100
Until we find
the seventh.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.268
And as soon
as that happens,

08:56.270 --> 08:58.169
We'll all be a hell
of a lot stronger.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.876
You want me to drive?

09:04.878 --> 09:07.012
You know, just in case
you forget how.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.047
                 Nice try.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.849
          How far is this place?

09:10.851 --> 09:13.585
     According to the app,
        four-hour drive.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.253
               We'll be there in
                 two. Buckle up.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.560
    It's a two-step process.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.228
        First, the nutrient-rich
           formulas are released

09:23.230 --> 09:26.598
                 Into the clouds
                  by our drones.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.601
          Then the silver iodine
           crystal is disbursed,

09:29.603 --> 09:32.704
        Binding with the formula
      to transform it into rain,

09:32.706 --> 09:34.806
   Which we call smart rain.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.174
          (clamoring)

09:36.176 --> 09:39.110
       Th-this ten-fold increase
          in yield you promised,

09:39.112 --> 09:40.245
                How quickly will
                    this happen?

09:40.247 --> 09:42.981
                  Well, it won't
               happen overnight.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.650
             As with any weather
            modification system,

09:45.652 --> 09:48.086
             We encourage people
              to view smart rain

09:48.088 --> 09:50.221
          As more of a long-term
        crop enhancement system.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.256
              N-not a quick fix.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.091
          (clamoring)

09:53.093 --> 09:55.994
How will smart rain
affect weather patterns?

09:55.996 --> 09:58.263
If you start playing god, aren't
there bound to be repercussions?

09:58.265 --> 09:59.264
                      That'll be
                    all for now.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.799
                  Thank you guys
                      very much.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.100
               No more questions
                      for today.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.468
   Thank you guys very much.
            Thanks.

10:03.469 --> 10:04.835
    I'm sorry, are you okay?
Yeah, i'm okay.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.671
I-i just need to work
on my blindside block.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.073
          Yeah, well, journalism
           can be kind of rough.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.107
I can handle it.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.609
                           Yeah.
Kendell dossing.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.110
                    Nice to meet
                   you, kendell.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.111
                What publication
                   are you with?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.879
    It's just a little blog.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.531
We write about
new agriculture.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.182
       You know, it's not
  <i> time</i> or <i> newsweek,</i> but, um...

10:18.185 --> 10:20.085
     An interview with you
    could put me on the map.

10:20.087 --> 10:23.088
        Well, i'll, uh,
     i'll make you a deal.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.756
        How about, um...

10:24.758 --> 10:26.224
   I'll give you an interview

10:26.226 --> 10:27.359
    If we do it over dinner.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.194
          Okay. Deal.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.096
                      Deal.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.092
Vera:
Well, if it isn't
the horsemen

11:01.094 --> 11:02.227
Of war and pestilence.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.362
What are you up to?

11:04.364 --> 11:06.398
Guess there's only
one way to find out.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.341
        ¶ down the road,
       down the road... ¶

11:16.343 --> 11:17.676
     It's not a good idea.

11:17.678 --> 11:18.877
Why not?

11:18.879 --> 11:20.378
The plan worked;
he agreed to do the interview.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.913
                Over dinner?

11:21.915 --> 11:23.014
You realize you're
about to break bread

11:23.016 --> 11:24.649
With the horseman of famine?

11:24.650 --> 11:26.283
                      He's not a
                   horseman yet.
He's still dangerous.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.119
 I know that you're protective,
 maybe even a little jealous...

11:28.121 --> 11:30.055
  I'm not jealous.
                           Fine.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.890
     But i was lucky enough
     to get the interview;

11:31.892 --> 11:33.425
 I'm not going to question him
     about where to do it.

11:33.427 --> 11:35.460
All right, well,
i should still go with you.
                         Raul...

11:35.462 --> 11:36.961
    I can hear his thoughts.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.697
           It's fine.

11:38.699 --> 11:39.964
         I've got this.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.229
              ¶ ¶

12:26.747 --> 12:28.813
      (computers beeping)

12:30.016 --> 12:31.516
       What's happening?

12:31.518 --> 12:34.519
                Madam secretary,
   we're cutting another sample.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.757
This one's glowing brighter than
          the others.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.258
                          Simon:
                As you're aware,

12:40.260 --> 12:41.426
The highest concentration

12:41.428 --> 12:42.761
                  Of the genesis
                         element

12:42.763 --> 12:44.763
                 Is at the core.

12:44.765 --> 12:47.766
        Let's just hope the next
              extraction attempt

12:47.768 --> 12:49.534
                Goes better than
                   the last one.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.774
Why is it turning blue?

12:55.776 --> 12:57.075
        I have no idea.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.389
           (gasping)

13:13.293 --> 13:15.059
Where's my body?

13:15.061 --> 13:17.462
           (gasping)

13:25.105 --> 13:27.172
            (gasps)

13:32.445 --> 13:34.279
          (door opens)

13:36.817 --> 13:38.383
             Vera.

13:38.385 --> 13:41.386
   So glad you could join us.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.488
 Rose told me about your gifts.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.356
     Yours is particularly
          interesting.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.891
        Spirit-walking?

13:46.893 --> 13:49.160
The way you died

13:49.162 --> 13:50.528
    In the trunk of the car?

13:50.530 --> 13:53.331
  And then again, right here?

13:53.333 --> 13:56.334
  Our guard spotted your body

13:56.336 --> 13:57.969
       On patrol outside.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.404
    He didn't recognize you.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.272
But i did.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.274
          Very clever.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.976
Oh, hurt yourself?

14:04.978 --> 14:06.244
         Where's alan?

14:06.246 --> 14:07.913
He's still alive.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.581
        You can see him
     as soon as you tell me

14:09.583 --> 14:11.983
         What you know
    about operation genesis.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.555
        I imagine these
  little spirit-walks of yours

14:17.557 --> 14:20.525
   Have been very revealing.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.028
         Come on, vera.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.363
      You're a messenger.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.631
          You know how
     this is gonna all end;

14:26.633 --> 14:28.032
     You know the prophecy.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.267
   Yeah, well, the prophecy's
        about to change.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.335
                     The rapture

14:30.337 --> 14:32.337
Isn't gonna happen on our watch.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.372
       You've got balls.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.974
Unfortunately,

14:35.976 --> 14:38.076
     Your fellow messengers

14:38.078 --> 14:40.311
  Are gonna have a hard time

14:40.313 --> 14:42.313
      Stopping the rapture
with one less among their ranks.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.052
    It's glowing blue again.

14:48.054 --> 14:51.055
Like earlier.

14:51.057 --> 14:54.325
While you were
spirit-walking, perhaps?

14:54.327 --> 14:55.677
                          Simon:
             The genesis element
                  hasn't changed

14:55.678 --> 14:57.028
         Its appearance
      at all before today.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.497
   But now, for some reason,

14:59.499 --> 15:01.900
It's behaving quite differently.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.102
Based on what i know about
this woman and her friends,

15:04.104 --> 15:05.470
I bet i know why.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.339
Move it closer to me.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.410
Now back to her.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.487
     Well, i'll be damned.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.958
      It's your lucky day.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.201
              ¶ ¶

15:47.180 --> 15:48.446
                       Waitress:
                 Right this way.

15:59.960 --> 16:00.992
                      Thank you.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.126
                Enjoy.

16:03.563 --> 16:04.562
To smart rain.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.464
                  To smart rain.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.269
Do you mind
if i record this?

16:11.271 --> 16:13.304
                   Um... No, no.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.207
 So it was a really nice party
    your company held today.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.242
     Uh, thank you. Thanks.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.311
         Yeah, smart rain's been
           in development for...

16:20.313 --> 16:22.413
          For seven years, so...

16:22.415 --> 16:24.282
         It's by far the biggest
        project we've ever done.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.651
       And the company...

16:26.653 --> 16:28.987
    It started as a-a family
    business, is that right?

16:28.989 --> 16:30.254
                     Yeah, yeah,
                         it did.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.490
                      Um, my dad

16:32.492 --> 16:34.325
          Moved us out here from
     oklahoma to start the farm,

16:34.327 --> 16:36.227
      And my brother and i
    have been working on it

16:36.229 --> 16:38.229
    Ever since we were kids.

16:38.231 --> 16:41.165
      So your brother says
    you're the science guy.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.633
   Does that mean smart rain
         is your idea?

16:42.635 --> 16:44.569
          Yeah. Um...

16:44.571 --> 16:46.537
         But vincent's
 the-the businessman, you know?

16:46.539 --> 16:49.507
         He's got, uh,
he's got these big plans, um...

16:49.509 --> 16:51.126
Hmm.

16:51.127 --> 16:52.744
 He's taking the company public
           tomorrow.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.645
       Uh, timed out with
   the launch of smart rain.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.481
        Congratulations.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.649
        From family farm
        to fortune 500.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.052
             Yeah.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.154
         Sometimes i...

17:03.156 --> 17:05.256
  Miss the family part of it.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.492
                     You know...
                Enough about me.

17:08.494 --> 17:09.493
                 What about you?

17:09.496 --> 17:10.627
                Do you... Do you
                   have any, uh,

17:10.630 --> 17:11.628
                     Any family?

17:11.631 --> 17:12.497
I do.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.498
       I have a daughter.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.165
        Her name's amy.
                            Amy?

17:15.167 --> 17:16.634
     You have any pictures?

17:16.636 --> 17:18.536
         I have plenty.
                           Okay.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.172
      Hundreds, actually.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.174
                 Oh, she's cute.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.342
            (laughs)

17:26.746 --> 17:28.813
   (people laughing, talking)

17:42.495 --> 17:44.495
      (doorknob rattling)

17:44.497 --> 17:46.397
The man:
Did you want to check out
vincent's office?

17:50.270 --> 17:51.569
          (door opens)

17:51.571 --> 17:53.771
          Come on in.
        Perfect timing.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.674
         His assistant went back
          for more potato salad.

17:56.676 --> 17:57.775
           (chuckles)

17:57.777 --> 18:00.778
        Leave me alone.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.447
   You know i can't do that.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.615
     Especially when i know
     you're onto something.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.518
   And it's in your interest

18:07.520 --> 18:09.187
        To work with me
     to stop this horseman.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.589
     Otherwise, i can make
  your future very unpleasant.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.559
      You can threaten me
         all you want.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.594
I know

18:16.596 --> 18:17.562
       You can't kill me.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.330
      God won't allow it.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.366
                      (laughing)

18:22.368 --> 18:24.268
     But what he will allow

18:24.270 --> 18:26.537
         Is payment for
       services rendered.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.606
                        You see,

18:28.608 --> 18:30.274
      When a deal is made

18:30.276 --> 18:32.543
         That allows me
     to resurrect someone--

18:32.545 --> 18:35.646
Like when your friends begged me
  to bring you back to life--

18:35.648 --> 18:37.648
      I get the final say

18:37.650 --> 18:39.617
      Over where your soul
        spends eternity.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.686
      (laughs)

18:43.523 --> 18:44.789
         You're lying.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.392
                   Kill yourself

18:48.394 --> 18:49.660
                     And try me.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.699
             Password protected.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.902
H-4-n-d-6.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.638
H. 4.
"n" as in nancy.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.440
                           D. 6.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.142
             And the pound sign.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.776
Or hashtag,
as the kids call it now.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.545
                      (chuckles)

19:07.547 --> 19:10.748
  You think anyone's password
       is safe around me?

19:12.619 --> 19:14.585
            Joshua:
       Okay. Smart rain.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.621
   Research and development.
          Here we go.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.923
             Projected yields...
                     Impressive.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.726
        But if it seems
     too good to be true...

19:21.728 --> 19:23.445
         It usually is.

19:23.446 --> 19:25.163
      I'm seeing all kinds
         of red flags.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.665
       Most of it raised
     by his brother, mark.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.734
If i'm reading
this right,

19:29.736 --> 19:32.470
    It says that smart rain
        kills any seeds

19:32.472 --> 19:34.939
    That aren't proprietary
    to plowman family farms.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.913
         Plowman farms
      has secretly tested

19:41.915 --> 19:43.581
        Smart rain here,

19:43.583 --> 19:44.916
  In my home country of mali.

19:44.918 --> 19:48.252
          And look...
  This entire village, ruined.

19:48.254 --> 19:51.656
        Only two farms,
      15 kilometers away,

19:51.658 --> 19:53.658
   Were given plowman seeds,
       and they are fine.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.227
   But here, crops have died.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.796
Once fertile land is now barren.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.333
    A promise to end famine

20:02.335 --> 20:05.436
   By developing a technology
   that actually creates it.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.704
            (laughs)

20:06.706 --> 20:08.773
   I must say, i'm impressed.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.508
  The e-mail says the footage
      was seized by force.

20:10.510 --> 20:14.212
     It was taken from him
     just after he shot it.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.646
Plowman farms is covering it up.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.382
  Paying people to stay quiet.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.484
      Those who won't have
     suddenly gone missing.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.587
     I fear for my safety.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.222
      But i will continue
         to investigate

20:24.224 --> 20:27.525
  Until the truth is revealed.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.928
    If smart rain is the sin
     that breaks the seal,

20:30.930 --> 20:33.698
 Then why wasn't it broken when
they tested it on this village?

20:33.700 --> 20:35.566
    Only a few dozen people
         were affected.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.669
       Tomorrow's launch
     will affect thousands.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.840
     Launch wasn't supposed
     to happen for another

20:42.842 --> 20:44.609
    Two months, but vincent
       pushed up the date

20:44.611 --> 20:47.545
  To coincide with the company
     going public tomorrow.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.647
     Despite mark's request
          for a delay.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.649
     Two brothers at odds.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.018
 It's as old as cain and abel.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.356
          Rose!

20:58.358 --> 20:59.523
            Oh, no.

20:59.525 --> 21:02.260
        She got to him.

21:03.696 --> 21:07.431
       Vincent plowman is
       the next horseman.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.806
  That's anthony on the left,
        and that's, uh,

21:15.808 --> 21:17.608
           Patrick on the right.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.310
I'm still amazed that i got them

21:19.312 --> 21:20.611
        To sit still long enough
              to take the photo.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.614
They are absolutely adorable.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.649
         Oh, thank you.
       They're good boys.

21:24.651 --> 21:25.950
For you, sir.
           Thank you.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.620
     It hasn't been easy on them

21:29.622 --> 21:31.022
   Since the divorce, but, um...

21:31.024 --> 21:33.858
                    Ah, kids are
            resilient, you know?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.493
Yeah, they are.
                   Yeah.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.827
And maybe one day
you can pass

21:36.829 --> 21:38.429
The family business
down to them.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.598
                  Yeah. Yeah, if
              vincent allows it.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.433
What do you mean?

21:42.435 --> 21:44.635
            Can i go off record?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.771
Yeah, sure.

21:46.773 --> 21:50.374
                 My dad, he, um,

21:50.376 --> 21:51.876
                 He made vincent

21:51.878 --> 21:54.812
       Majority owner of plowman
           farms before he died.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.347
Well, why not both of you?

21:56.349 --> 21:58.582
                Ah, he built the
                farm on his own.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.651
             He's used to having
             one decision maker.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.053
              I guess he thought
                that vincent was

22:02.055 --> 22:04.088
   More right for the job, so...

22:04.090 --> 22:06.791
     But, you know, i mean, it's
   like vincent, he's always had

22:06.793 --> 22:08.459
    This way of charming my dad.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.528
       I-i can never match that.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.763
That must've been
tough for you.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.533
                    Yeah.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.868
                I mean, i was...

22:17.870 --> 22:19.937
         I was the good student.
          I was the straight as,

22:19.939 --> 22:21.806
              The valedictorian,
                   and vincent,

22:21.808 --> 22:23.774
      He just has this charisma,
             so then my dad pays

22:23.776 --> 22:25.443
      All this attention to him.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.677
                 It's always the
                 same, you know?

22:26.679 --> 22:27.812
      I'd come up with the ideas

22:27.814 --> 22:29.613
   For the farm and then vincent

22:29.615 --> 22:31.615
            Takes credit for it.

22:31.617 --> 22:32.883
                     Still does.

22:32.885 --> 22:35.753
Your dad never saw through that?

22:35.755 --> 22:37.455
                         No. No.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.924
              At least, he never
             let on that he did.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.460
                  He just, uh...

22:42.462 --> 22:43.961
          He loved vincent more.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.666
     And i know that i'm-i'm not
         the most personable guy

22:48.668 --> 22:50.067
               In the world, but

22:50.069 --> 22:52.970
          That doesn't mean that
         i can't run a business.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.573
       Now, with my dad, he said
       that i-i lacked ambition.

22:55.575 --> 22:59.043
           That i, um, i was too
        meticulous and hesitant.

22:59.045 --> 23:02.813
       But... I believe in doing
           things the right way.

23:02.815 --> 23:03.881
Let me guess.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.116
Vincent loves a quick score.

23:05.118 --> 23:07.017
                        Exactly.

23:07.019 --> 23:09.854
 So... It made things difficult.

23:09.856 --> 23:13.157
     Now, we don't often see eye
     to eye on certain projects.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.992
Like smart rain?

23:14.994 --> 23:17.895
             Mark:
 <i> Yeah, exactly like smart rain.</i>

23:17.897 --> 23:20.498
   <i> And when it destroys farms</i>
   <i> after vincent launches it,</i>

23:20.500 --> 23:23.434
        <i> He'll make sure</i>
      <i> i get all the blame.</i>

23:24.837 --> 23:26.771
I get it. Really, i do.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.839
I think that you and i
are a lot alike.

23:28.841 --> 23:29.974
If something doesn't feel right,

23:29.976 --> 23:31.776
I hit the brakes.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.944
There are good risks
and there are bad ones.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.179
You know what i mean?

23:35.181 --> 23:38.048
       (cell phone dings)

23:38.050 --> 23:40.151
             Uh...

23:40.153 --> 23:42.019
         And speak of the devil,
                   it's vincent.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.655
 I guess he has some last-minute
        paperwork i got to sign.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.724
                  I-i got to go.
                  I'm-i'm sorry.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.492
That's okay.
I understand.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.931
     Why don't you come with me?

23:53.932 --> 23:55.899
    I'll sign the paperwork, and
    then, uh, and then we can go

23:55.902 --> 23:56.934
               Somewhere, finish
                what we started?

23:56.936 --> 23:58.068
Yeah, that'd be great.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.070
             Okay.
             Okay.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.080
       Welcome to smyrna.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.782
    A lovely place to live,

24:11.784 --> 24:13.884
     Work and be kidnapped.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.855
      Do you think this is

24:17.857 --> 24:19.957
   The abandoned power plant
      where vera might be?

24:19.959 --> 24:22.526
                 I don't see any
                other buildings.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.495
          All right, let's split
            up and look for her.

24:24.497 --> 24:25.863
     Meet you on the other side.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.031
Yeah.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.839
     I can walk by myself!
         Get off of me!

24:34.841 --> 24:36.106
She should be wearing
a protective suit.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.942
   Relax. You worry too much.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.511
            Every time we try to
        transfer it from a solid

24:40.513 --> 24:42.713
To a liquid state, the results
have been catastrophic!

24:42.715 --> 24:44.148
      Yeah, but this time
       will be different.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.816
And if you're wrong?

24:45.818 --> 24:48.052
   Then she'll be incinerated
like the rest of your lab rats.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.521
       All right, it's showtime.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.156
            (dings)
     prepare to initialize.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.092
      I'm not doing this!

24:55.094 --> 24:56.527
         I don't care.

24:56.529 --> 24:57.928
       You're gonna have
      to kill me instead!

24:57.930 --> 24:59.196
                    No.

24:59.198 --> 25:02.233
      I'd rather kill him.

25:02.235 --> 25:03.934
             Alan?

25:03.936 --> 25:06.103
           It's fine, it's okay.
My...

25:06.105 --> 25:07.137
           It's fine, it's fine!

25:07.139 --> 25:08.739
       It's your choice.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.841
           I'm good.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.918
                 Don't do it, v.
It's okay.

25:20.919 --> 25:22.852
                V, no. I'm good!
         I'm fine! V, no! V, no!

25:22.855 --> 25:24.855
                 Don't do it, v!

25:24.857 --> 25:26.991
                 V, don't do it!

25:34.867 --> 25:37.201
   We're ready when you are.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.264
           (whirring)

26:32.725 --> 26:34.224
                          Simon:
                   It's working.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.760
                          Cindy:
                        Success!

26:36.762 --> 26:38.762
                  You want me to
              kill them for you?

26:38.764 --> 26:41.098
 No, i prefer to do it myself.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.216
                        Hold it!

26:59.218 --> 27:01.085
          You shouldn't be here.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.319
        Car broke down.

27:02.321 --> 27:03.988
  You got a phone i could use?

27:03.990 --> 27:05.222
                      No.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.091
      What is this place?
                    Turn around.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.258
             Hands on your head.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.235
            (grunts)

27:22.308 --> 27:25.242
       Unless you want him to do
    the same thing to your neck,

27:25.244 --> 27:27.845
  I'd suggest you start talking.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.047
      I know. So, this is
       the board room...

27:30.049 --> 27:31.882
Okay.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.184
  Who's she?

27:34.186 --> 27:35.819
         She-she's a journalist.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.221
      She-she's interviewing me.

27:37.223 --> 27:39.857
          Not anymore.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.425
      Why? What-what's going on?

27:44.063 --> 27:45.396
You know what?
Um, it's okay.

27:45.398 --> 27:47.898
I'm gonna wait outside.
                  Okay.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.034
             Hey, i'm-i'm sorry.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.102
Don't worry about it.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.174
Vincent:
You and me, we've had
our differences

27:57.176 --> 27:58.976
Over the years, but, um...

27:58.978 --> 28:02.680
      Lately we both know
       it's gotten worse.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.185
You mean because of smart rain.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.455
I already told you
it's not ready yet.

28:11.457 --> 28:14.024
We got to delay the launch,
changes have to be made

28:14.026 --> 28:15.259
To make the formula safer.

28:15.261 --> 28:18.028
 Those changes will be made...
           Over time.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.763
You know full well
that any farm that doesn't

28:19.765 --> 28:21.965
Use our seed is gonna
lose their harvest!

28:21.967 --> 28:23.200
Vincent:
That's why the rollout
is happening

28:23.202 --> 28:25.903
In drought-stricken areas--
am i right?

28:25.905 --> 28:28.272
      Certain crops fail,
      we blame it on that!

28:28.274 --> 28:30.441
       We are protected!

28:30.443 --> 28:33.010
By lies.
                     This is why

28:33.012 --> 28:35.746
  I called the board together
  for this emergency meeting.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.215
    Our financial consultant

28:38.217 --> 28:40.818
              Told us repeatedly
                  tomorrow's ipo

28:40.820 --> 28:44.722
        Depends heavily on smart
         rain launching on time!

28:44.724 --> 28:47.057
                  We are running
             out of money, mark.

28:47.059 --> 28:50.461
   Any delay will raise huge red
       flags with our investors.

28:50.463 --> 28:53.931
And what happens to the people
whose farms are destroyed?

28:53.933 --> 28:56.133
 They-they wouldn't be destroyed
       if they bought our seeds.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.071
You're not planning on changing
the formula, are you, huh?

29:01.073 --> 29:03.474
    You're not. This is just
   another money ploy, right?

29:03.476 --> 29:06.009
 Force people to buy our seeds?

29:06.011 --> 29:08.245
I'm just trying to do
the best for this company.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.013
Unlike you.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.381
      I made this company!
No!

29:11.383 --> 29:14.118
     Dad made this company!

29:14.120 --> 29:16.353
     And he left it to me.

29:16.355 --> 29:19.256
Smart rain is
happening tomorrow.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.325
As is the ipo.

29:23.829 --> 29:27.798
But you're not gonna be
part of it.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.234
                  What?
You're a distraction, mark.

29:30.236 --> 29:33.537
At a time when we
can't afford any.

29:33.539 --> 29:36.106
Which is why the board has voted

29:36.108 --> 29:38.342
To accept your resignation

29:38.344 --> 29:40.811
Effective immediately.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.015
      You think i'm gonna
     keep quiet about this?

29:45.017 --> 29:46.049
Smart rain is your idea.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.284
So, you go public

29:47.286 --> 29:49.987
With any of your issues,

29:49.989 --> 29:52.856
I'll make sure everybody knows
where to point the finger.

29:52.858 --> 29:54.825
   Vincent, i have evidence.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.293
         No, you don't.
          Not anymore.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.263
   Your file's being deleted
          as we speak.

29:59.265 --> 30:03.167
You may have the brains.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.335
But you don't have
leadership skills.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.371
You're weak.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.807
Dad knew it
and so do i.

30:09.809 --> 30:10.974
A true leader

30:10.976 --> 30:12.376
         Doesn't delay.

30:12.378 --> 30:13.977
         A true leader

30:13.979 --> 30:15.546
         Takes action.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.918
Well, i'm not signing anything.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.220
        Doesn't matter.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.421
          You're out.

30:36.468 --> 30:37.868
                  Mark, what...?

30:37.870 --> 30:39.169
                   What's wrong?

30:39.171 --> 30:40.871
Why don't you ask vincent?

30:40.873 --> 30:42.940
I don't work here anymore.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.157
         (phone chimes)

31:05.197 --> 31:07.931
                    Those drones
                  fly on my cue,

31:07.933 --> 31:10.300
                 At exactly 3:00
                  p.M. Tomorrow,

31:10.302 --> 31:12.002
             Not a second later,
                     understand?

31:12.004 --> 31:13.070
Mm-hmm.

31:17.276 --> 31:18.442
                           Whoa!

31:18.444 --> 31:19.443
Easy, plowman.

31:19.445 --> 31:20.911
       What do you want?

31:20.913 --> 31:21.912
        You want money?

31:21.914 --> 31:23.146
This isn't
about money.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.481
It's about the lives
you're about to destroy.

31:24.483 --> 31:25.983
  What are you talking about?

31:25.985 --> 31:27.417
   Smart rain.

31:27.419 --> 31:28.886
     Famine.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.153
                    Okay, for...

31:30.155 --> 31:32.155
           Fine. I won't launch.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.657
                  I'll scrap the
                  whole project.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.425
          <i> Say whatever he wants</i>
          <i> and he'll let you go.</i>

31:35.427 --> 31:37.027
Let you go?

31:37.029 --> 31:39.529
                         I'm not
                 letting you go.

31:39.531 --> 31:42.499
      I'm eliminating you
before you can do any more harm.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.470
             Alan:
  <i> Ow. Definitely a broken rib.</i>

31:46.472 --> 31:49.406
       I know this looks
       really bad, but...

31:49.408 --> 31:51.008
     It also really hurts.

31:53.212 --> 31:55.379
Oh...
      Sorry i dragged you
         into all this.

31:55.381 --> 31:58.615
      I pretty much barged
        my way in, so...

31:58.617 --> 32:01.985
     No need to apologize.

32:01.987 --> 32:05.155
           Besides...

32:05.157 --> 32:07.991
  I couldn't stand the thought
of you going through this alone.

32:09.461 --> 32:12.462
You're the only person
i ever really cared for.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.531
    Or who ever really cared
           about me.

32:16.035 --> 32:20.037
 So, as far as i'm concerned...

32:20.039 --> 32:22.172
        There's no place
    i'd rather be right now.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.976
            Really?
            (laughs)

32:25.978 --> 32:29.046
      Maybe a few places.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.614
       Several, actually.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.522
                          Cindy:
                  Open the gate.

32:42.561 --> 32:43.627
       Give me your gun.

32:46.231 --> 32:47.297
Dismissed.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.574
       You're free to go.

33:02.047 --> 33:03.680
                    Oh...

33:03.682 --> 33:04.748
                     Koa.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.417
Thank god.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.486
We gotta get going.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.673
Can you walk?

33:12.674 --> 33:14.758
    I'll sprint if it means
 getting the hell out of here.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.526
Please, don't...

33:16.528 --> 33:17.694
         Don't do this.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.763
I have a family.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.365
       I have a daughter.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.333
      Sh... She needs me.

33:25.304 --> 33:26.603
    You have a family, too.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.138
  I-i can see it in your eyes.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.306
 Why would you want to do this?

33:29.308 --> 33:30.774
                     Shut up!

33:30.776 --> 33:33.043
             Raul.

33:33.045 --> 33:34.344
    Raul, put the gun down.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.946
         Listen to me.

33:35.947 --> 33:37.547
We can talk him out of
launching smart rain.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.149
       Yeah, she's right.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.550
  I'll-i'll cancel the launch.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.552
       I'll... I'll scrap
       the whole project,

33:42.554 --> 33:44.554
I promise.
              No, it's all lies.

33:44.556 --> 33:45.589
             We did this before.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.007
       What?

33:47.008 --> 33:48.424
    We got through to leland
schiller and then what happened?

33:48.427 --> 33:50.794
           These sins just don't
            happen on their own.

33:50.796 --> 33:53.597
           It's about the person
              that commits them.

33:53.599 --> 33:56.500
    And the only way to stop
  this man is by killing him.

33:56.502 --> 33:57.801
   No. No, no, please, don't.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.636
What if it's just another test?

33:59.638 --> 34:01.705
  What about the greater good?

34:01.707 --> 34:03.473
       If killing this man saves
         the rest of humanity...

34:03.475 --> 34:05.776
      No, killing is never
       the right choice.

34:05.778 --> 34:07.611
Do not let your past

34:07.613 --> 34:10.514
      Become your future.

34:10.516 --> 34:14.051
           If you do,
    i won't be a part of it.

34:14.053 --> 34:15.719
   Don't do the devil's work.

34:26.098 --> 34:28.065
           (exhales)
           thank you.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.766
       You have my word,

34:29.768 --> 34:31.101
        I'm not gonna...
           (gunshot)

34:31.103 --> 34:32.569
            (gasps)

34:57.362 --> 34:58.595
         What's wrong?

34:58.597 --> 35:00.430
      The fourth horseman
        broke his seal.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.338
                        The man:
                     Give it up!

35:08.340 --> 35:09.606
     The horseman of famine
        is in the house!

35:11.176 --> 35:13.510
    Although i must confess,

35:13.512 --> 35:14.811
   I was sure that smart rain

35:14.813 --> 35:17.280
Would be the sin
that broke the seal.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.882
But i guess it's sibling rivalry
          for the win.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.652
 God works in mysterious ways,
          doesn't he?

35:22.654 --> 35:24.721
Listen...

35:24.723 --> 35:26.723
  I think you and i could work
     really well together.

35:26.725 --> 35:29.326
 After all, i had a few issues
       with my father...

35:29.328 --> 35:30.527
       Save your breath.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.730
I'm not working with you, ever.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.634
                Rose got to you,
                too, didn't she?

35:39.705 --> 35:42.706
   She played the two of you
      against each other.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.274
 Knew that, one way or another,

35:44.276 --> 35:46.543
 She would get another horseman
           out of it.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.650
Haven't you
had enough, mark?

35:56.855 --> 35:59.656
            The man:
        <i> Probably didn't</i>
       <i> take much coaxing</i>

35:59.658 --> 36:01.391
      From her to get you
      to pull the trigger.

36:01.393 --> 36:02.459
            Did it?

36:04.196 --> 36:05.829
  A true leader takes action.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.934
Now stay the hell out of my way.

36:17.743 --> 36:21.945
          ¶ here bring
      your wounded heart ¶

36:21.947 --> 36:25.582
   ¶ here tell your anguish ¶

36:25.584 --> 36:28.652
    ¶ earth has no sorrow ¶

36:28.654 --> 36:32.455
  ¶ but your love can remove ¶

36:33.759 --> 36:38.562
  ¶ a watcher is at the gate ¶

36:38.564 --> 36:39.763
                     Hey.
                You all right?

36:39.765 --> 36:42.265
 Just thinking about my father.

36:42.267 --> 36:43.767
  ¶ woods long forgotten... ¶

36:43.769 --> 36:46.303
       Can't even conjure
       his face anymore.

36:46.305 --> 36:49.773
Another piece of my memory gone.

36:49.775 --> 36:52.876
        How much longer
    before i've got nothing?

36:54.613 --> 36:55.845
 Do you have any other family?

36:55.847 --> 36:58.949
   If i do, i don't remember.

36:58.951 --> 37:00.684
      ¶ your look does not
        bear a reproof ¶

37:00.686 --> 37:03.286
  Well, you got a brother now.

37:03.288 --> 37:05.255
   ¶ your look does not bear
          a reproof ¶

37:05.257 --> 37:07.657
        And seriously...

37:07.659 --> 37:10.527
  Who could forget this face?

37:10.529 --> 37:13.463
          ¶ here bring
    your wounded heart... ¶

37:13.465 --> 37:15.232
              Hey.
       I'm proud of you.

37:15.234 --> 37:16.566
You did the right thing today.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.934
        Well, it doesn't matter;
             i'm already damned.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.803
     I know you don't want
       to talk about it,

37:19.805 --> 37:21.438
       But does this have
         anything to do

37:21.440 --> 37:23.773
        With the letter
      the devil mentioned?

37:23.775 --> 37:26.810
 Somehow, he managed to get all
the charges against me dropped.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.778
      Look, even if he did
       something for you,

37:28.780 --> 37:29.746
  You don't owe him anything.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.815
         None of us do.

37:33.919 --> 37:37.687
 Please tell me how in the hell

37:37.689 --> 37:39.489
   Were they able to escape?

37:39.491 --> 37:40.924
Obviously, they got help

37:40.926 --> 37:42.592
From some of
the other messengers,

37:42.594 --> 37:43.727
But it doesn't matter.

37:43.729 --> 37:45.028
    Now that we've been able

37:45.030 --> 37:47.664
To distill the genesis element,

37:47.666 --> 37:49.766
        We can proceed.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.301
        Finally, famine.

37:51.303 --> 37:53.803
Cindy:
And death herself.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.406
     Is the element secure?

37:56.408 --> 37:57.874
      Ready for transport.

37:58.744 --> 37:59.843
     So how does this work?

37:59.845 --> 38:02.779
         I'll show you.

38:02.781 --> 38:06.583
      All you need is one

38:06.585 --> 38:08.852
           Tiny drop

38:08.854 --> 38:10.387
     To unleash its power.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.855
What are you doing?

38:24.703 --> 38:26.770
          (crackling)

38:33.812 --> 38:35.645
                It's the perfect
                         weapon.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.781
            Indeed.

38:37.783 --> 38:38.982
    Thanks to war's efforts
       in weaponizing it.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.450
Now,

38:40.452 --> 38:41.785
  All we need are those drones

38:41.787 --> 38:43.520
From famine

38:43.522 --> 38:44.988
And a computer virus
from pestilence.

38:44.990 --> 38:48.058
       Then rest assured,
the fifth seal will bring death

38:48.060 --> 38:51.828
         Like the world
     has never seen before.

38:59.771 --> 39:00.770
Hey, how's alan?

39:00.772 --> 39:02.222
Vera:
He's okay.

39:02.223 --> 39:03.673
            They transferred him
            to houston memorial.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.775
Broken ribs, bruised kidney...
He's gonna be okay, though.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.877
     They're just gonna keep him
        another one or two days.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.114
    Guys, i know things seem
    pretty bleak right now,

39:11.116 --> 39:12.482
    But the game isn't over.

39:12.484 --> 39:14.517
      Well, we're 0 for 4.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.386
  So we're not doing so good.

39:16.388 --> 39:17.921
The horsemen
are united.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.789
 They're probably going to use
      the genesis element

39:19.791 --> 39:23.126
     As some sort of weapon
   to break the fifth seal...

39:23.128 --> 39:25.862
   And that means destruction
    on a much larger scale.

39:25.864 --> 39:28.765
    I know, in their hands,

39:28.767 --> 39:30.934
          This element
    is extremely dangerous.

39:30.936 --> 39:33.136
  But listen, when i was there

39:33.138 --> 39:34.738
    And i was distilling it,

39:34.740 --> 39:36.906
        I felt this rush
      of positive energy.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.408
    Just-just being near it

39:38.410 --> 39:40.043
    Healed a wound that was
          on my wrist.

39:40.045 --> 39:43.880
         This element,
in the right hands-- our hands--

39:43.882 --> 39:46.049
 It could be a force for good,
           i know it.

39:52.858 --> 39:54.924
          (screaming)

40:02.868 --> 40:04.834
                 Another vision?

40:04.836 --> 40:06.603
Yeah.

40:06.605 --> 40:09.606
Only this one
was different.

40:09.608 --> 40:11.941
   Like god was trying to...

40:11.943 --> 40:13.977
         Show me a way
     to stop the horsemen.

40:13.979 --> 40:15.979
                            Koa:
                            How?

40:17.449 --> 40:19.849
   I saw the face of someone
        who can help us.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.118
                  Who?

40:24.790 --> 40:26.556
     The seventh messenger.
