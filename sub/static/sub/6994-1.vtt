00:16.149 --> 00:21.052
<i> We've talked</i>
<i> a lot this semester about</i>
<i> the infinite potential</i>

00:21.054 --> 00:23.554
<i> that each of us</i>
<i> carry within ourselves,</i>

00:23.556 --> 00:28.057
with theories from sartre,
to Rogers, to maslow.

00:29.592 --> 00:31.793
But now, with Christmas
rapidly approaching,

00:31.795 --> 00:33.194
I regret to say that

00:33.196 --> 00:35.462
we've reached the end
of our class.

00:37.898 --> 00:39.298
I know.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.966
But as we leave
the class behind,

00:40.968 --> 00:43.134
I hope that each of you
can take a moment
and ask yourselves...

00:44.670 --> 00:46.302
What can you take away
from it all?

00:46.304 --> 00:48.137
It's tough to get
enlightened.

00:50.141 --> 00:51.807
So true, Ryan.

00:51.809 --> 00:53.308
And how do we get there?

00:54.677 --> 00:56.611
How do we become people

00:56.613 --> 00:58.613
who always strive
to be better?

00:59.348 --> 01:00.881
How can any of us live

01:00.883 --> 01:04.650
a truly inspired life?

01:04.653 --> 01:07.086
For each of us, the answer is
maybe different.

01:07.088 --> 01:10.488
But what's important
is asking the questions.

01:11.323 --> 01:13.857
"What matters to me?

01:13.859 --> 01:16.292
"What fulfills me?

01:16.294 --> 01:18.694
"What gives my life meaning?

01:18.696 --> 01:21.863
"What is it
that I really want?"

01:21.865 --> 01:24.131
Pretty simple, straightforward
questions, right?

01:26.034 --> 01:27.400
Don't be fooled.

01:27.402 --> 01:30.403
The answers don't
always come easily.

01:30.405 --> 01:34.740
And if we're really
honest with ourselves,

01:34.742 --> 01:37.375
they might not always be
what we expect.

02:01.098 --> 02:03.198
Okay, here we go, miss.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.234
My personal favorite.
Enjoy.
Thank you. Looks delicious.

02:06.236 --> 02:08.869
Oh, oops!
Almost forgot.
Mmm.

02:12.573 --> 02:13.973
Aww!

02:13.975 --> 02:16.909
He never kisses me
like that.
Me, neither.

02:16.911 --> 02:18.343
No comment.

02:18.345 --> 02:20.511
Andi, Kathy,
don't be jealous.

02:20.513 --> 02:23.614
Dorothy and I, we just have
a special connection.

02:23.616 --> 02:25.716
Hey, Lindsay.
Hey, Becca.

02:25.718 --> 02:27.484
I hear he's been
kissing the customers
behind my back.

02:27.486 --> 02:28.785
You're supposed to be
looking out for me.

02:28.787 --> 02:30.620
Sorry. He's the boss.

02:30.622 --> 02:32.521
Hey, what? I thought
us girls were supposed to
look out for each together.

02:32.523 --> 02:35.090
I inspire loyalty
in my staff.

02:35.092 --> 02:37.525
Oh, hey, uh...
New desserts are ready.

02:37.527 --> 02:38.626
I'm still tweaking
the recipes, so,

02:38.628 --> 02:41.095
curious to know
what you think.

02:41.097 --> 02:42.830
They look amazing.
Have you tried them?

02:42.832 --> 02:44.865
Well, they're pastries,
so I just love them all.

02:44.867 --> 02:47.334
That's why I need my
official taste tester.

02:47.336 --> 02:50.136
Well, it's a hardship,
but I'll do it for you.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.839
Whoa! These are really good.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.207
Yeah?
Yeah.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.409
I mean, maybe, like,
a touch more cinnamon.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.877
Yeah. Yeah, I know,
i was... yeah.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.712
That's what it is. Yeah.
Right? Yeah.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.879
Okay.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.482
All right,
I'm out of here.

03:05.484 --> 03:08.051
Hey, before you go,
um...

03:08.053 --> 03:10.253
I was kind of hoping

03:10.255 --> 03:12.355
I could take you
out to dinner tonight.

03:12.357 --> 03:15.324
I was thinking maybe ginos?

03:15.326 --> 03:16.825
Ginos? What's the occasion?

03:18.661 --> 03:21.963
No occasion. Just, you know,
we're young, we're in love.

03:21.965 --> 03:23.831
What more reason
do we need?

03:23.833 --> 03:25.165
Oh, you know, I'm supposed
to help my mom

03:25.167 --> 03:26.199
with the senior holiday
food drive,

03:26.201 --> 03:28.067
so can we rain check?

03:28.069 --> 03:30.102
Uh...
No!

03:30.104 --> 03:31.903
Well...
So, wait,

03:31.905 --> 03:35.072
you're saying that you
are choosing canned goods
over ginos?

03:35.074 --> 03:41.344
How about if
i bribed your mother with
an extra box of pastries?

03:41.346 --> 03:42.878
Okay? Extra coffee?

03:42.880 --> 03:44.546
Do you think that maybe
she'd let you off the hook?

03:44.548 --> 03:46.247
Okay, if you're gonna go
to those lengths...

03:46.249 --> 03:47.815
You want to come pick me up?

03:47.817 --> 03:49.583
Why don't we meet there?
Say, like, 8:00?

03:49.585 --> 03:51.651
I've just got a bunch
of stuff to do here.

03:51.653 --> 03:54.387
Yeah. Of course.
Sounds good,
I'll see you there. Bye.

03:54.389 --> 03:55.721
Love you.
Bye.

03:55.723 --> 03:56.855
Love you, too.

04:02.860 --> 04:03.926
Yeah, nailed it.

04:04.827 --> 04:05.960
Smooth. Yeah.

04:06.895 --> 04:07.961
What?

04:40.325 --> 04:42.259
Mrs. Jamison.

04:42.261 --> 04:43.560
Let me help you.

04:43.562 --> 04:45.261
Oh, I'm fine.
I don't need your help.

04:45.263 --> 04:47.563
No, I know, I know,
but, really, it's no problem.

04:47.565 --> 04:50.331
I said, I'm fine.
Okay.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.400
I'm not an invalid,
you know.

04:54.235 --> 04:56.269
No, I know that.

05:01.941 --> 05:03.374
Leave those there.

05:03.376 --> 05:04.975
I'll get them in a minute.

05:10.847 --> 05:12.247
You're welcome.

05:20.955 --> 05:22.956
I'm home.

05:22.958 --> 05:24.757
Mom. Grandpa.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.959
- Hey.
- Hi, honey.

05:26.961 --> 05:28.727
Hey. How's it going?

05:28.729 --> 05:30.295
Don't look! Don't look!

05:30.297 --> 05:33.164
Do not come into this room!
I'm wrapping presents.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.598
Don't look!

05:34.600 --> 05:36.132
I'm not looking!
I'm wrapping presents!

05:36.134 --> 05:38.000
I'm not looking.
Don't worry, but...

05:38.002 --> 05:39.568
Do not come into this room!

05:39.570 --> 05:41.603
I'm not looking,
but if I was, and...

05:43.872 --> 05:46.306
And, clearly, I'm not.

05:46.308 --> 05:49.609
I would say that
that dress that you're
trying so hard to hide,

05:49.611 --> 05:53.779
the one that looks incredibly
similar to the one
from my wish list,

05:53.781 --> 05:55.413
it's perfect.

05:55.415 --> 05:57.515
It's so perfect, in fact, I,
kind of, sort of, really,

05:57.517 --> 05:59.416
truly, wanna have
it right now.

06:00.184 --> 06:01.817
Hi, mom.
There you are.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.652
We were about to
send out a search party.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.120
Sorry, I stopped in
to see Jason,

06:05.122 --> 06:07.388
and then I just bumped
into Mrs. Jamison.

06:07.390 --> 06:09.690
Try to cut her some slack.
She's lonely.

06:09.692 --> 06:11.224
Don't worry, she's not
going to get me down.

06:11.226 --> 06:12.758
This is my favorite
time of year.

06:13.893 --> 06:15.526
Oh, mom, here.

06:15.528 --> 06:20.230
Jason sent these, and these,
for the delivery tonight.

06:20.232 --> 06:22.532
How sweet of him.

06:22.534 --> 06:24.400
Speaking of Jason,
is it okay if I pass on
coming with you tonight?

06:24.402 --> 06:25.801
He asked me on a date.

06:25.803 --> 06:28.436
At ginos.
Yeah, that's fine.

06:29.070 --> 06:30.870
Merry Christmas.

06:36.775 --> 06:39.810
Oh, grandpa. Thank you.
Oh!

06:41.013 --> 06:42.312
I love it.

06:43.580 --> 06:45.814
So I'm a sucker.

06:45.816 --> 06:48.883
This girl sure has you
wrapped around her
little finger, daddy.

06:48.885 --> 06:51.218
Well, I wonder
who she takes after.

06:55.322 --> 06:56.721
Thank you.

07:02.393 --> 07:04.594
Well, that is some dress.

07:05.462 --> 07:06.762
I know.

07:06.764 --> 07:08.463
I feel kind of guilty.
It's expensive.

07:08.465 --> 07:10.364
Well, you can
always return it.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.332
Yeah, I don't feel
that guilty.

07:15.735 --> 07:18.803
So, another semester down.

07:18.805 --> 07:22.073
Your father would be so proud
to see you living your dream.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.241
Yeah, if only my dream
were to live at home forever

07:24.243 --> 07:25.742
and make just enough
to get by.

07:25.744 --> 07:27.543
I love having you here.

07:27.545 --> 07:28.977
It'd be quiet without you.

07:28.979 --> 07:30.678
Well, that's why
you need to sign on

07:30.680 --> 07:32.546
to that singles website
that we signed you up for.

07:32.548 --> 07:35.749
Oh! No.
That is not romantic.

07:35.751 --> 07:38.017
Come on, how else are you
going to meet a guy?

07:38.585 --> 07:40.152
It's time.

07:41.522 --> 07:43.421
So, ginos, huh?

07:44.590 --> 07:46.122
What's the special occasion?

07:46.124 --> 07:47.857
Apparently,
we don't need one,

07:47.859 --> 07:50.125
because "we're young,
and we're in love,"

07:50.127 --> 07:51.926
and that's all the reason
we need.

07:52.294 --> 07:53.761
Huh.

07:55.663 --> 07:57.030
What's that
supposed to mean?

07:58.232 --> 07:59.699
Nothing.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.768
It's just ginos.

08:03.770 --> 08:06.837
The most expensive
place in this town?

08:13.777 --> 08:14.843
No...

08:16.145 --> 08:18.312
You don't think?

08:21.149 --> 08:23.216
No, no, no, no.
No, no.

08:23.218 --> 08:25.751
No, no, he said
there's no occasion.

08:25.753 --> 08:28.353
I'm just going to take him
at his word.

08:28.355 --> 08:29.987
Well, all right, then.

08:33.490 --> 08:34.990
You okay?

08:34.991 --> 08:38.192
Yeah. I think
i just stood up too fast.

08:39.561 --> 08:43.563
I am gonna
finish up here.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.532
Why don't you go
get yourself dolled up?

08:54.403 --> 08:56.137
Going home, girls.

08:56.139 --> 08:58.072
Wait, grandpa.
What do you think?

09:07.246 --> 09:09.280
You look stunning, my dear.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.515
Simply stunning.

09:11.517 --> 09:14.284
Thank you.
You have great taste.

09:14.286 --> 09:16.486
Uh...

09:16.488 --> 09:18.621
Hey, what are you
doing going out
without your coat on?

09:18.623 --> 09:20.255
You're going to catch
pneumonia.

09:20.257 --> 09:22.423
I think I can survive
crossing the street.

09:24.527 --> 09:27.661
You have a great night.
Thank you.

09:27.663 --> 09:29.696
- Huh.
- Wait, Lindsay.

09:29.698 --> 09:31.364
Hang on a sec.

09:31.366 --> 09:33.032
Bye, dad.
Bye, Shannon.

09:33.034 --> 09:35.667
Here's your purse,
your coat...
Thank you.

09:35.669 --> 09:38.136
And a message came for you.

09:38.138 --> 09:40.138
"Stephanie Jackman"?
Who's that?

09:40.140 --> 09:42.740
I don't know. She just
said it was important.
She asked you to call back.

09:43.641 --> 09:45.141
Hmm...

09:48.612 --> 09:52.080
<i> Hello.</i>
<i> You've reached Dean Jackman's</i>
<i> office at Yale university.</i>

09:52.082 --> 09:53.881
<i> Please leave</i>
<i> a detailed message.</i>

09:56.316 --> 09:58.116
Yeah, hello.

09:58.118 --> 10:00.218
Hi, Dean Jackman at
Yale university.
This is Lindsay Rogers.

10:00.220 --> 10:02.987
<i> I'm returning your call.</i>
<i> I'm sorry to be calling</i>
<i> so late.</i>

10:02.989 --> 10:05.022
<i> I just wanted to</i>
<i> let you know that</i>

10:05.024 --> 10:06.990
<i> I will be available</i>
<i> throughout the holidays</i>

10:06.992 --> 10:10.759
<i> if you want to</i>
<i> reach me at all.</i>

10:10.761 --> 10:12.427
Hello.

10:12.429 --> 10:14.896
Hi, Dean Jackman.
Yeah, hi. Um...

10:14.898 --> 10:16.264
I didn't realize
you were still there.

10:16.266 --> 10:19.200
I was just leaving
but I'm glad you called.

10:19.202 --> 10:23.037
I was forwarded your thesis
by our university press.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.340
Right. My gosh,
I'm very eager
to get it published.

10:26.342 --> 10:28.775
<i> We all think it is</i>
<i> an impressive work.</i>

10:28.777 --> 10:31.677
And if it's still
available, on behalf
of the university press,

10:31.679 --> 10:34.712
I would like to
extend an offer
to have it published.

10:38.148 --> 10:39.815
Wow! That is, um...

10:39.817 --> 10:42.083
I'm very happy
to hear you say that.

10:42.085 --> 10:46.020
We believe that
your work could resonate
with the general public.

10:46.022 --> 10:48.989
<i> Now, I don't like to</i>
<i> toss around phrases</i>
<i> like "bestseller,"</i>

10:48.991 --> 10:53.092
<i> but the press thinks</i>
<i> that there is a mass-market</i>
<i> potential for your work.</i>

10:53.094 --> 10:55.794
It could use some
tailoring, of course.

10:55.796 --> 10:59.798
Wait, you think that
<i> "inspired: A study in</i>
<i> self-conceptualization</i>

10:59.800 --> 11:02.801
<i> "and its quantifiable</i>
<i> impact on interpersonal</i>
<i> paradigm outcomes"</i>

11:02.803 --> 11:04.435
could be a bestseller?

11:04.437 --> 11:07.905
So maybe the title
could use some work.

11:07.907 --> 11:11.508
How does the title
"inspired" sound to you?

11:13.345 --> 11:15.745
Wow.
<i> And while you're</i>
<i> considering that,</i>

11:15.747 --> 11:20.416
<i> we also have an associate</i>
<i> professorship opening</i>
<i> in our psychology department.</i>

11:20.418 --> 11:23.886
<i> Now, I can't make</i>
<i> any guarantees</i>
<i> at this time, of course,</i>

11:23.888 --> 11:27.155
<i> but it is a full</i>
<i> tenure-track position.</i>

11:27.157 --> 11:29.423
<i> I think that you could</i>
<i> be a good fit.</i>

11:29.425 --> 11:33.560
Now, if you're interested,
I'd like to fly you
here to Connecticut,

11:33.562 --> 11:37.763
show you around our
department and introduce
you to our faculty.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.632
I, um...

11:40.634 --> 11:43.635
I'm genuinely at a loss...
I don't...

11:43.637 --> 11:44.769
I don't know what to say.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.303
I'm hoping
you'll say "yes."

12:08.390 --> 12:10.891
<i> Hey, you reached me. </i>
<i> You know what to do.</i>

12:10.893 --> 12:14.694
Hi, babe. Sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,
but ginos is closed.

12:16.096 --> 12:17.663
Oh, <i> scusi, signorina,</i>
please.

12:17.665 --> 12:19.231
I'm so sorry,
i didn't see you.

12:19.233 --> 12:21.266
Please, come in.
Come in.
You are open.

12:21.268 --> 12:23.534
Oh, <i> si.</i> Please,
your table is waiting.
Come in, please.

12:23.536 --> 12:26.270
Okay.

12:26.272 --> 12:27.838
It's...

12:27.840 --> 12:29.539
You look very beautiful
this evening.
This is really nice.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.807
Yes. You look
<i> come una Stella.</i>

12:31.809 --> 12:33.241
Like a star.

12:33.243 --> 12:36.143
Please. Mr. Stewart
will be here very shortly.

12:36.145 --> 12:37.244
Thanks.

12:38.312 --> 12:40.613
Oh, um...

12:40.615 --> 12:42.815
Do you think someone
could maybe tell me
what's going on?

12:42.817 --> 12:45.250
Certainly.
While you are waiting,

12:45.252 --> 12:50.454
Mr. Stewart has arranged
a private screening of
a very special little movie.

12:52.491 --> 12:54.290
It's beautiful.

12:55.392 --> 12:57.192
Uh...
<i> Grazie, grazie.</i>

12:59.295 --> 13:00.962
Enjoy.
Thank you.

13:08.836 --> 13:12.638
<i> Oh, hello.</i>
<i> I didn't see you there.</i>
<i> Welcome to our show.</i>

13:12.640 --> 13:14.373
<i> I'm so glad that</i>
<i> you could join me.</i>

13:14.375 --> 13:16.775
<i> Tonight, we bring you</i>
<i> a love story.</i>

13:16.777 --> 13:21.980
<i> And not just any love story,</i>
<i> this is</i> the story of Jason
and Lindsay.

13:21.982 --> 13:24.282
<i> Or, as your family</i>
<i> would call it...</i>

13:24.284 --> 13:26.584
<i> The story of Lindsay</i>
<i> and Jason.</i>

13:26.586 --> 13:30.387
<i> Though we both grew up</i>
<i> in the quiet little town</i>
<i> of harborview,</i>

13:30.389 --> 13:32.922
<i> only a few blocks away</i>
<i> from one another,</i>

13:32.924 --> 13:36.792
<i> our epic love</i>
<i> didn't really begin</i>
<i> until the sixth grade,</i>

13:36.794 --> 13:40.962
<i> when I played Joseph</i>
<i> to your Mary in the</i>
<i> annual Christmas pageant.</i>

13:40.964 --> 13:43.364
<i> And like many great</i>
<i> thespians before me,</i>

13:43.366 --> 13:48.068
<i> I followed the time-honored</i>
<i> tradition of falling in love</i>
<i> with my leading lady.</i>

13:48.070 --> 13:55.608
<i> But, sadly, it was a love</i>
<i> that went unrequited for</i>
<i> many long, lonely years.</i>

13:55.610 --> 13:58.677
<i> Alas, the "years of exile."</i>

13:58.679 --> 14:00.945
<i> The years when you,</i>
<i> Lindsay Anne Rogers,</i>

14:00.947 --> 14:05.249
<i> blossomed into</i>
<i> the ravishing beauty</i>
<i> you are today, while I...</i>

14:05.251 --> 14:09.652
<i> Well, let's just say</i>
<i> the awkward years</i>
<i> weren't kind to me.</i>

14:10.955 --> 14:13.021
<i> But, fortunately,</i>
<i> as you grew up,</i>

14:13.023 --> 14:16.090
<i> and moved off to college,</i>
<i> then came back home,</i>

14:16.092 --> 14:19.960
<i> I grew out of my braces</i>
<i> and transformed into</i>
<i> the ruggedly handsome,</i>

14:19.962 --> 14:21.828
<i> chiseled man</i>
<i> you know me as today.</i>

14:23.197 --> 14:26.098
<i> Well, I got my </i>
<i>braces off, anyway.</i>

14:26.100 --> 14:29.401
<i> The point is,</i>
<i> the day finally came</i>

14:29.403 --> 14:33.271
<i> when you walked into</i>
<i> my coffee shop</i>
<i> and back into my life.</i>

14:33.273 --> 14:36.741
<i> And that moment,</i>
<i> when we first saw each other</i>

14:36.743 --> 14:39.043
<i> after all those years,</i>
<i> was magical.</i>

14:39.045 --> 14:43.381
<i> I instantly knew it was</i>
<i> love at first sight,</i>
<i> all over again.</i>

14:43.383 --> 14:44.882
<i> For you?</i>

14:44.884 --> 14:46.483
<i> I don't know.</i>

14:46.485 --> 14:48.685
<i> I mean, maybe my world-famous</i>
<i> dark-chocolate double Espresso</i>

14:48.687 --> 14:49.852
<i> had something to do with it.</i>

14:49.854 --> 14:51.420
<i> But whatever it was,</i>

14:51.422 --> 14:53.989
<i> the day finally came</i>
<i> when you fell in love with me</i>

14:53.991 --> 14:56.491
<i> like I had fallen</i>
<i> in love with you,</i>
<i> all those years before.</i>

14:57.292 --> 14:59.426
<i> And that's why,</i>
<i> sweetheart,</i>

14:59.428 --> 15:03.430
<i> the man behind you</i>
<i> has something he would</i>
<i> like to ask you.</i>

15:07.435 --> 15:12.305
Okay, so in my mind,
i thought that that was
gonna be really cool,

15:12.307 --> 15:16.042
but watching it now,
i feel like a total idiot,

15:16.044 --> 15:18.644
so I'm hoping
that we can just forget
that that ever happened.

15:18.646 --> 15:21.913
And, I'm hoping that...

15:23.181 --> 15:26.716
You would do me the honor
of marrying me

15:26.718 --> 15:29.452
and spending the rest
of your life with me.

15:52.375 --> 15:53.708
Lindsay?

15:58.145 --> 16:00.212
Lindsay.

16:00.214 --> 16:03.081
I'm sorry, I just need
a little bit of air.

16:04.616 --> 16:08.718
I was so sure
that you'd say yes.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.186
I thought you'd be happy.

16:10.188 --> 16:13.489
- I know, I know.
- I'm sorry. I...

16:13.491 --> 16:15.324
Lindsay, what is this?
What's going on?

16:17.093 --> 16:19.828
Just before I got here,
i was offered a job at Yale.

16:19.830 --> 16:21.095
Yale?

16:23.164 --> 16:25.031
Wow!

16:25.033 --> 16:26.565
It's an associate
professorship
that just opened up.

16:28.267 --> 16:30.101
They also wanna
publish my work.

16:30.802 --> 16:32.135
That's amazing.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.637
But so...
I don't understand. Like...

16:37.039 --> 16:39.373
So you applied
for a job?
No.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.174
No, I didn't
apply for a job.

16:41.176 --> 16:43.476
I mean, obviously,
i submitted my thesis for
publication, you knew that,

16:43.478 --> 16:46.011
but I didn't know that
a position was opening up.

16:46.013 --> 16:49.180
But, Jason, I mean,
they're talking about
full tenure.

16:49.182 --> 16:52.249
I mean, I could be
a full professor at Yale.

16:52.251 --> 16:54.217
That's incredible.
Um...

16:54.219 --> 16:57.353
But I just re-upped
my lease on the shop.

16:57.721 --> 16:59.121
I know.

17:03.325 --> 17:07.227
Lindsay, this is amazing
news, for you,

17:07.229 --> 17:10.463
but I just asked you
to marry me,

17:10.464 --> 17:15.165
and it sounds like
you suddenly wanna walk away
from everything we have here.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.134
Okay.

17:17.136 --> 17:18.602
That's not really fair.
It's not?

17:18.604 --> 17:20.203
This is huge
for me, Jason.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.471
What about us?
There can still be an us.

17:22.473 --> 17:23.538
In Connecticut.

17:29.244 --> 17:32.713
I don't...
Wow...

17:32.715 --> 17:34.981
This really did not
go the way I thought
it would,

17:34.983 --> 17:36.649
I have to say.

17:36.651 --> 17:38.017
Okay.

17:38.785 --> 17:40.418
Yeah.

17:40.420 --> 17:43.254
Well, here. Just...
You can take this.

17:43.256 --> 17:45.055
Keep it. Or sell it.
Or throw it away.

17:45.057 --> 17:47.157
I just... I don't want it.
I don't want to see it
ever again.

17:54.632 --> 17:55.797
Jason, will you...

17:58.767 --> 18:00.033
Jason.

18:20.486 --> 18:23.087
<i> Hey, you've reached me. </i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

18:24.522 --> 18:27.824
Jason. Please
just call me back.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.051
<i> Look, daddy.</i>

18:58.053 --> 19:03.155
<i> Teacher says,</i>
<i> "every time a bell rings,</i>
<i> an angel gets his wings."</i>

19:03.157 --> 19:06.257
<i> That's right. </i>
<i>That's right.</i>

19:11.194 --> 19:14.495
Hey, baby. I was wondering
when I was gonna
hear from you.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.398
Hey, mom.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.166
What happened?
Are you okay?

19:22.969 --> 19:25.103
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm okay.

19:25.904 --> 19:27.571
You don't sound fine.

19:29.140 --> 19:31.141
<i> What's going on?</i>

19:34.411 --> 19:36.545
Well, you were right.
Um...

19:37.346 --> 19:40.414
Jason proposed tonight.

19:41.883 --> 19:43.817
And what did you say?

19:45.386 --> 19:49.254
Well, I didn't say
the one word he was
hoping I would say.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.490
Okay.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.358
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

19:57.462 --> 19:59.261
Why did it
have to be tonight?

20:00.496 --> 20:02.396
<i> Honey, where are you?</i>

20:05.266 --> 20:08.001
I don't know what to do.

20:08.003 --> 20:10.636
<i> Lindsay, you need</i>
<i> to come home.</i>

20:10.638 --> 20:13.839
I'm...
Mom, I'm sorry I called.
I'm gonna go now, okay?

20:13.841 --> 20:15.240
Honey, don't go.

21:25.171 --> 21:26.838
Whoa!

21:31.009 --> 21:32.275
Hey.

21:32.277 --> 21:34.744
I didn't mean
to disturb you.

21:34.746 --> 21:39.815
I was taking mistletoe
back to the stable.
We had some latecomers.

21:39.817 --> 21:41.349
They wanted a ride,

21:41.351 --> 21:45.185
and so now it's way past
our bedtime, I'm afraid.

21:46.655 --> 21:48.888
I didn't know they did
carriage rides out here.

21:48.890 --> 21:52.258
Oh, yeah, every Christmas.
Kids love it.

21:52.260 --> 21:55.527
I mean, it would be better
if I had the use of a sleigh,

21:55.529 --> 21:58.229
but what can I tell you,
welcome to the pacific
northwest.

21:59.030 --> 22:00.864
Yeah.

22:00.866 --> 22:06.902
Pulling a sleigh
without any snow is no fun,
especially for mistletoe.

22:08.238 --> 22:09.370
Oh, look at that.
She likes you.

22:10.706 --> 22:12.972
She only likes nice people,
so you must be nice.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.375
Something tells me
she likes everyone.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.243
Busted.

22:19.345 --> 22:23.013
You look like you could
use a carriage ride.

22:24.615 --> 22:26.682
That's all right.
I'm fine.

22:26.684 --> 22:28.750
No, come on.
Don't be afraid.

22:28.752 --> 22:32.619
Besides, mistletoe and i
would enjoy your company.

22:32.621 --> 22:35.487
It's okay.
It'll be an adventure.

22:38.391 --> 22:39.923
Okay.

22:39.925 --> 22:41.692
Could you adventure me
up to the parking lot?

22:41.694 --> 22:43.827
Of course. I'd love
to be of service.

22:43.829 --> 22:46.095
Hop in.
Thanks.

22:50.533 --> 22:54.602
All right, mistletoe,
off to the races.

23:07.381 --> 23:09.048
Rough night?

23:10.116 --> 23:12.150
It started out great.

23:13.385 --> 23:16.153
One of the best nights
of my life.

23:16.155 --> 23:17.254
What happened?

23:17.256 --> 23:19.222
My boyfriend
proposed to me.

23:19.224 --> 23:22.858
Boy. That's... monumental.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.059
Yeah.

23:25.027 --> 23:27.695
I also got an incredible
job offer.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.897
One I never imagined
in a million years.

23:29.899 --> 23:34.467
Whoa! Two proposals
on the same night.

23:34.469 --> 23:36.134
Yeah, I guess you could
put it that way.

23:38.470 --> 23:40.671
You're at a real crossroads.

23:43.875 --> 23:45.609
Funny, isn't it?

23:45.611 --> 23:48.979
Some decisions aren't
as simple as we think.

23:48.981 --> 23:51.748
I just had
this exact conversation
with my students.

23:51.750 --> 23:54.817
You're a teacher?
Down at harborview.

23:54.819 --> 23:58.086
So, what did you
tell your kids?

23:58.088 --> 24:01.289
I asked them to consider
the big questions in life.

24:01.291 --> 24:05.158
You know, to ask themselves
what's really important.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.760
Oh, that sounds like
good advice.

24:09.229 --> 24:10.662
Ah!

24:10.664 --> 24:13.197
You'll figure it out.

24:13.199 --> 24:15.599
Sometimes, all you need...

24:16.601 --> 24:18.101
Is a little time.

24:23.540 --> 24:26.441
Will you look at that?

24:34.449 --> 24:35.849
Whoa!

24:45.859 --> 24:48.126
It looks like
the northern lights.

24:50.762 --> 24:51.828
Whoa!

24:55.632 --> 24:57.065
Did you see...

25:28.194 --> 25:29.494
What?

25:52.517 --> 25:53.884
Seriously?

26:34.425 --> 26:36.292
Professor Rogers.

26:36.294 --> 26:38.294
Hey. I don't believe it.

26:39.429 --> 26:41.563
Hi. Come here. Hi.

26:41.565 --> 26:42.964
Hi. Hi, Ryan.
You remember my name?

26:42.966 --> 26:46.033
You remember my name.
That is so cool.

26:46.035 --> 26:47.300
Welcome back to town.

26:48.702 --> 26:50.335
What's going on?
What do you mean?

26:51.437 --> 26:52.837
I mean...

26:53.939 --> 26:54.838
What is this?

26:54.840 --> 26:56.206
Wait, do you not like it?

26:56.208 --> 26:57.307
I can change it.

26:57.309 --> 26:59.242
I don't understand...

27:00.410 --> 27:01.710
I have...

27:02.712 --> 27:04.979
I should go home.
Okay.

27:05.413 --> 27:06.713
Okay. Uh...

27:21.394 --> 27:23.795
Are you kidding me?

27:23.797 --> 27:26.230
Jason opened
a second shop?

27:51.321 --> 27:52.854
Be right with you.

28:01.763 --> 28:04.364
Becca, what is going on?

28:04.366 --> 28:06.265
What is this?

28:06.267 --> 28:08.567
Lindsay?

28:08.569 --> 28:11.269
What are you doing here?
What do you mean
what am I doing here?

28:11.271 --> 28:13.771
I was just
walking down the street,

28:13.773 --> 28:16.106
and then I saw a new shop
that Jason opened that
i didn't know anything about.

28:16.108 --> 28:17.574
Huh?

28:17.576 --> 28:20.209
Did Jason open a new shop
without telling me?

28:21.444 --> 28:22.977
Have you gone mental?

28:24.779 --> 28:27.113
Is Jason here?
No.

28:27.115 --> 28:28.714
Okay, well,
if you hear from him,

28:28.716 --> 28:30.148
can you tell him
that I need to talk
to him now?

28:30.983 --> 28:33.985
Look, he's up in bellingham.

28:33.987 --> 28:36.420
We're just about to
open another shop.

28:36.422 --> 28:38.388
He's not in bellingham,
Becca. I just saw him
a little while ago at ginos.

28:38.390 --> 28:39.889
No.

28:39.891 --> 28:41.390
Look, I don't know
who you saw at ginos,

28:41.392 --> 28:44.192
but I just talked to him
a little while ago myself.

28:44.194 --> 28:47.528
Jason is in bellingham,
opening up our third store.

28:47.530 --> 28:49.563
Third store?

28:49.565 --> 28:52.899
Look, I don't know what it is
that you're doing here,

28:52.901 --> 28:54.867
but it's not amusing,
all right?

28:54.869 --> 28:58.370
You take off for years
and then just conveniently
pop up now?

29:48.987 --> 29:51.487
Mom!

29:54.959 --> 29:57.125
Mom, my key isn't working!

30:01.396 --> 30:02.729
Mom!

30:04.431 --> 30:05.864
Mom!

30:05.866 --> 30:08.166
Mom, wake up!

30:08.168 --> 30:09.867
Mom!
What do you think
you're doing?

30:09.869 --> 30:11.134
Have you lost your mind?

30:11.136 --> 30:13.836
Mrs. Jamison.
My key isn't working.

30:14.737 --> 30:16.504
Are you drunk or something?

30:16.506 --> 30:20.441
Is this some kind of a joke?
Is this supposed to be funny?

30:20.443 --> 30:22.743
I'm sorry...
Stop shouting
like a banshee.

30:22.745 --> 30:24.177
I'll call the sheriff.

30:24.179 --> 30:26.078
I just... I can't wake
my mom up.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.380
Can't imagine why not.

30:28.382 --> 30:31.249
What's the matter with you?
She's been gone for two years.

30:31.251 --> 30:33.984
You become some kind
of nutjob back east?

30:34.785 --> 30:36.418
What?

30:36.420 --> 30:39.154
And where were you when
she had her heart attack?

30:40.356 --> 30:41.723
Huh?

30:41.725 --> 30:44.025
What are you
talking about?

30:44.027 --> 30:46.494
Go on, then.
Keep on banging.

30:46.496 --> 30:50.297
You'll just have to explain
it all to the deputies
when they come.

31:00.807 --> 31:02.207
Mom!

31:03.776 --> 31:05.109
Mom, wake up!

31:07.645 --> 31:09.045
Lindsay?

31:10.414 --> 31:11.947
Grandpa.

31:14.583 --> 31:15.883
Is that you?

31:21.088 --> 31:22.655
Are you my Christmas
present?

31:22.657 --> 31:24.156
Ah!

31:28.094 --> 31:29.761
You should have warned me
you were coming.

31:29.763 --> 31:31.195
Warned you?

31:31.197 --> 31:32.729
I just saw you
a few hours ago.

31:32.731 --> 31:33.830
I beg your pardon?

31:33.832 --> 31:36.798
Well, when you
gave me this dress.

31:37.900 --> 31:40.467
Honey, are you okay?

31:42.937 --> 31:46.539
That was three years ago.

32:06.625 --> 32:07.791
Here you go.

32:07.793 --> 32:10.326
Oh!

32:10.328 --> 32:13.062
Ooh, thanks.
This'll warm you up
in no time.

32:18.767 --> 32:21.967
You really don't remember
about your mother?

32:23.736 --> 32:27.804
I swear I saw her, literally,
like, a few hours ago.

32:27.806 --> 32:28.905
I can't believe she's dead.

32:28.907 --> 32:30.706
What?

32:30.708 --> 32:32.441
She's not dead.

32:33.776 --> 32:35.943
She's not?
No.

32:35.945 --> 32:37.044
Good grief.

32:37.046 --> 32:39.246
She's in Sweden.

32:39.248 --> 32:42.749
Wait. Sweden?
Sure.

32:42.751 --> 32:48.087
After her heart attack,
Dr. gustaf swept her
off her feet.

32:48.089 --> 32:49.555
Love at first sight.

32:51.057 --> 32:52.490
How could you forget this?

32:53.592 --> 32:55.459
I honestly don't know.

32:55.461 --> 32:57.627
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

32:57.629 --> 33:02.530
Turns out,
three of her arteries
were completely blocked.

33:02.532 --> 33:04.532
Thank goodness
she met Stefan.

33:04.534 --> 33:08.102
The only drawback was that
after they were married,

33:08.104 --> 33:11.438
he decided to take her
to Stockholm.

33:12.874 --> 33:14.340
I think I'm losing my mind.

33:14.342 --> 33:16.542
I certainly don't think
you're losing your mind.

33:16.544 --> 33:19.044
I mean, I don't know
what other explanation
there is.

33:19.046 --> 33:20.578
I don't know...

33:20.580 --> 33:21.612
Time travel?

33:23.948 --> 33:25.715
Could I have amnesia?

33:25.717 --> 33:28.984
That probably makes
a little more sense
than time travel.

33:28.986 --> 33:32.287
I think I must be having
a psychotic break.

33:32.289 --> 33:37.091
I think what you need
is a good night's sleep.

33:37.093 --> 33:38.926
You get some rest,

33:38.928 --> 33:42.295
and I'm sure everything
will look a lot better
in the morning.

33:42.963 --> 33:44.463
Hmm...

33:45.531 --> 33:46.631
Thank you.

33:48.066 --> 33:49.466
Love you.

34:10.951 --> 34:12.484
Good morning, grandpa.

34:13.552 --> 34:14.618
Morning.

34:17.286 --> 34:18.754
Hmm...

34:21.690 --> 34:25.159
I see you found the clothes
i left out for you.

34:25.161 --> 34:26.760
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

34:28.094 --> 34:29.395
How you feeling?

34:29.963 --> 34:31.830
Any better?

34:31.831 --> 34:33.764
Did last night
really happen?

34:33.766 --> 34:35.299
I'm afraid so.

34:36.301 --> 34:37.501
Sorry.

34:39.469 --> 34:41.337
I tried calling your mom,

34:41.339 --> 34:44.039
but Astrid,
she's your step-sister,

34:44.041 --> 34:46.474
said that she was out
running errands.

34:47.309 --> 34:48.708
We'll try calling later.

34:55.216 --> 34:56.748
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

35:09.128 --> 35:11.863
I don't remember anything.

35:11.865 --> 35:16.400
I don't remember
anything about Yale.

35:16.402 --> 35:20.803
Would you mind telling
when exactly I supposedly
moved to Connecticut?

35:22.305 --> 35:23.838
After Christmas time.

35:25.073 --> 35:27.274
That was three years ago.

35:27.276 --> 35:29.242
So I just
up and left?

35:29.244 --> 35:30.843
Mmm-hmm.

35:30.845 --> 35:33.312
I mean, your mom
came and saw you.

35:33.314 --> 35:36.114
That was a few weeks
before she had her attack.

35:37.516 --> 35:40.784
And then she met some doctor
and she left?

35:40.786 --> 35:42.752
He's an awful nice guy.

35:46.356 --> 35:51.326
It's my considered
and professional opinion that
I've officially lost my mind.

35:51.328 --> 35:53.194
I think you'd better
take me to a hospital.

35:53.196 --> 35:55.563
I don't know.

35:55.565 --> 35:58.599
I may not be the sharpest
crayon in the box,

35:59.334 --> 36:00.834
but it seems to me,

36:00.836 --> 36:02.902
committing yourself
might not be so great

36:02.904 --> 36:05.770
for a famous
psychology professor.

36:07.439 --> 36:10.507
Yeah, but, sometimes,
a person needs to know
when to ask for help.

36:43.506 --> 36:44.839
Okay. Just tell me.

36:46.174 --> 36:48.875
Well, what would you
like to know?

36:50.545 --> 36:52.745
Well, I can see his business
is doing well.

36:52.747 --> 36:55.247
I mean, he opened
a second location.

36:55.249 --> 36:57.048
But how's he?

36:57.050 --> 37:00.551
- Do you see him at all?
- From time to time.

37:00.553 --> 37:02.819
Ran into him
a few months ago.

37:03.887 --> 37:05.187
And?

37:06.022 --> 37:07.422
What?

37:11.193 --> 37:13.693
Well... uh...

37:15.729 --> 37:16.895
He had some news.

37:18.898 --> 37:20.297
What?

37:22.900 --> 37:24.166
He's getting married.

37:27.937 --> 37:30.104
I've met her, in fact.

37:30.106 --> 37:32.172
She works with him
at the coffee shop.

37:34.941 --> 37:37.909
Seems like a nice girl.

37:37.911 --> 37:41.579
Not as nice as you,
obviously,

37:41.581 --> 37:44.114
but they seem happy.

37:44.116 --> 37:47.584
I think he said they
were getting married
over the holidays.

37:52.055 --> 37:53.722
Well, let's go.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.530
There's no sign of trauma.

38:03.532 --> 38:06.199
And you say you're not
on any prescription drugs
or sedatives?

38:06.201 --> 38:08.668
No. Never.

38:08.670 --> 38:10.603
This is not
really my field,

38:10.605 --> 38:14.273
but retrograde amnesia,
the damage is usually
caused by head trauma,

38:14.275 --> 38:18.677
or a stroke, or tumor,
and I don't see anything
like that here.

38:18.679 --> 38:21.813
That's good news,
right?
Well...

38:21.815 --> 38:26.183
Dissociative amnesia
is psychological in nature,

38:26.185 --> 38:29.019
and I'm thinking that
might be more the case.

38:29.021 --> 38:31.287
Yeah. That's what
I'm wondering about.

38:31.289 --> 38:33.922
Still, I think we should
wait for the blood panels
to come back.

38:33.924 --> 38:36.224
Is it something
that disappears?

38:36.226 --> 38:37.825
Goes away in time?

38:37.827 --> 38:39.493
Retrograde amnesia is
usually temporary, right?

38:39.495 --> 38:41.328
I mean,
that's my recollection.

38:42.631 --> 38:44.931
The recollection
of an amnesiac.

38:44.933 --> 38:46.898
Now, that's called irony.

38:49.501 --> 38:52.669
Uh... sorry.

38:52.671 --> 38:55.638
If that's even what it is,
yes, it can be temporary.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.239
But what if that's
not what it is?

38:57.241 --> 38:59.741
Well, let's take it
step by step.

38:59.743 --> 39:02.110
Why don't you try and rest
for the next few days?

39:02.112 --> 39:04.712
We'll re-evaluate
and see how you are then.

39:04.714 --> 39:06.714
See if anything
comes back to you.

39:19.293 --> 39:21.327
Let's go get some lunch.

39:21.329 --> 39:23.395
I think I need
to go for a walk.

39:24.130 --> 39:25.697
I'll see you later on.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.819
Excuse me?

39:48.821 --> 39:51.555
Hi. Could you tell me
where they run
the carriage rides out of?

39:51.557 --> 39:53.423
You must be
at the wrong park, miss.

39:53.425 --> 39:56.192
Horses are not allowed here.

39:56.194 --> 39:59.328
No, I mean the guy who
runs the carriage rides
for Christmas?

39:59.330 --> 40:01.831
I've worked here
close to 30 years.

40:01.833 --> 40:04.667
I never heard of anyone
giving carriage rides.

40:04.669 --> 40:08.237
No. It was literally right...
Right there.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.872
I met him.
He was very astute.

40:10.874 --> 40:13.407
Could have been
three years ago?

40:13.409 --> 40:15.008
Nope. Not ever.

40:17.711 --> 40:19.611
Okay, thank you.

40:19.613 --> 40:21.812
Sorry to...
I'm sorry to bother you.

40:24.415 --> 40:26.649
What is going on?

40:27.985 --> 40:29.050
Is she okay?

40:30.085 --> 40:31.819
I don't know.

40:31.821 --> 40:33.554
Come on, kids.
We need to go.
Sorry.

40:33.556 --> 40:34.821
Come on.

40:36.156 --> 40:37.556
It's all fine.

40:37.558 --> 40:40.825
Don't mind me. I'm having
a total meltdown.

40:40.827 --> 40:43.093
Other than that,
it's all good.

41:35.875 --> 41:37.508
Yeah.

41:39.277 --> 41:41.578
Is this your car?

41:42.446 --> 41:43.913
Sorry.

41:43.915 --> 41:46.782
I, uh... I think your tire
might be a little low.

41:46.784 --> 41:49.484
Maybe you should
get it checked.

41:54.890 --> 41:56.190
They look happy,
don't they?

41:57.625 --> 41:58.891
Yeah.

42:23.516 --> 42:25.049
Merry Christmas.

42:30.955 --> 42:32.055
Lindsay?

42:32.656 --> 42:34.056
Lindsay?

42:36.292 --> 42:38.025
Lindsay, wait!
Where are you going?

42:40.128 --> 42:42.529
Lindsay.

42:42.531 --> 42:43.997
Where are you going?

42:43.999 --> 42:45.631
Hey. Jason, hi.

42:45.633 --> 42:47.265
Hi.
How are you?

42:47.267 --> 42:49.467
What was that?
Nothing.

42:49.469 --> 42:51.635
I, um...

42:51.637 --> 42:53.803
I saw you were busy,
so I didn't wanna,
you know, interrupt.

42:53.805 --> 42:55.671
When did you get to town?

42:56.739 --> 42:58.573
Sorry, I shouldn't
have come.

42:58.575 --> 43:01.042
I'm just...
I can't believe you're...

43:01.044 --> 43:02.109
You're here.

43:03.544 --> 43:06.178
Congrats on the business.

43:06.180 --> 43:07.379
I see you're expanding.

43:07.381 --> 43:09.948
Yeah, we're doing okay,
but what about you?

43:09.950 --> 43:13.217
Best-selling book
and everything.
That's huge.

43:14.385 --> 43:15.985
I hear you're
getting married.

43:17.187 --> 43:20.889
Yeah. Yeah. We're finally
going to tie the knot.

43:20.891 --> 43:23.057
In just a couple days,
actually.

43:24.392 --> 43:26.025
Um...

43:26.027 --> 43:28.360
Listen, I would
invite you in for
a second, but...

43:28.362 --> 43:31.029
No. Of course.
No, I get it.

43:31.031 --> 43:33.231
You kind of freaked
Becca out last night.

43:33.233 --> 43:36.334
Yeah. I was just surprised
to see the new shop.

43:36.336 --> 43:37.601
Just tell her I'm sorry.

43:38.569 --> 43:40.169
I will.

43:42.738 --> 43:44.972
I'm gonna go.
Okay.

43:44.974 --> 43:47.975
I've got so much to do,
so... yeah.
I bet.

43:47.977 --> 43:49.109
Well, it's good
to see you.
Yeah. You, too.

43:49.111 --> 43:51.845
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.

43:51.847 --> 43:53.346
Okay. Okay. I don't...
Yeah.

43:53.348 --> 43:54.714
Okay.
Yeah.

43:55.582 --> 43:57.015
Okay. Bye.

44:00.852 --> 44:03.053
Hey, Lindsay?
Uh...

44:03.821 --> 44:05.655
How long are you in town?

44:07.290 --> 44:09.457
I honestly don't know.

44:09.459 --> 44:11.792
If there's one thing
i can absolutely,
positively tell you,

44:11.794 --> 44:13.260
it's that I don't know.

44:13.262 --> 44:16.830
Well, congratulations
on the book, you know.

44:16.832 --> 44:20.233
You knew what you wanted,
and you made it happen.

44:20.235 --> 44:21.334
You did good.

44:44.221 --> 44:45.888
It's for you.

44:47.023 --> 44:48.990
Who is it?
I don't know.

44:53.828 --> 44:56.663
Hello?
There you are. Finally.

44:56.665 --> 44:59.032
I have been trying
everywhere to reach you.

45:00.501 --> 45:02.802
I'm sorry, who is this?

45:02.804 --> 45:04.370
<i> What do you mean,</i>
<i> "who is this?"</i>

45:04.372 --> 45:06.205
I talked to the folks at
the university press.

45:06.207 --> 45:07.839
They couldn't get
ahold of you.

45:07.841 --> 45:09.540
<i> No one on the faculty</i>
<i> has heard from you,</i>

45:09.542 --> 45:12.075
<i> and your agent is</i>
<i> completely clueless.</i>

45:12.077 --> 45:13.476
Dean Jackman?

45:13.478 --> 45:15.344
<i> I'm sorry, are you</i>
<i> trying to be cute?</i>

45:15.346 --> 45:17.179
<i> Is this you being cute?</i>

45:17.181 --> 45:19.947
'Cause you, my friend,
should know by now
that I do not do cute.

45:21.349 --> 45:22.816
Sorry.

45:22.818 --> 45:24.884
<i> Okay, so, do you think</i>
<i> you can explain to me</i>

45:24.886 --> 45:28.787
why I had to track you down
using your emergency contacts
in Washington,

45:28.789 --> 45:30.488
when they have you booked on

45:30.490 --> 45:33.657
<i> all the morning shows</i>
<i> on the east coast next week?</i>

45:33.659 --> 45:36.259
Wait, what?

45:36.261 --> 45:38.694
Really?
<i> Yes, really.</i>

45:38.696 --> 45:40.829
<i> Did we not discuss this?</i>

45:40.831 --> 45:44.865
I'm sorry. I just have had
some personal stuff
I've been dealing with.

45:44.867 --> 45:47.767
Grandpa, I'm supposed
to be on TV next week.

45:49.871 --> 45:52.137
So, does this mean
that my book is really
a bestseller?

45:52.139 --> 45:54.706
<i> Look, I told you,</i>
<i> I don't do cute.</i>

45:54.708 --> 45:56.274
Now, the university press
said that

45:56.276 --> 45:59.810
this quarter's royalties
were wired to your account.

45:59.812 --> 46:02.946
Like, how much money
are we talking?

46:02.948 --> 46:05.548
<i> I believe just over</i>
<i> two million.</i>

46:06.884 --> 46:08.950
Two million dollars?

46:08.952 --> 46:10.684
<i> Is everything okay,</i>
<i> Lindsay?</i>

46:12.286 --> 46:13.486
Yeah.

46:13.488 --> 46:15.120
Yeah, I'm great, I just...

46:15.122 --> 46:19.157
Why haven't you been returning
my emails or my calls?

46:19.159 --> 46:20.424
My...

46:20.426 --> 46:24.360
I don't have my computer
and my phone is broken.

46:24.362 --> 46:27.830
What on earth?
How did you manage that?

46:27.832 --> 46:32.834
Everything got lost
or damaged in my trip.

46:32.836 --> 46:35.069
Go buy yourself
some new stuff.

46:35.071 --> 46:37.404
I don't have my purse,
either.
Seriously?

46:37.406 --> 46:39.639
Um, do you have any ID?

46:39.641 --> 46:41.874
Nope, nothing.

46:41.876 --> 46:45.477
Okay, we might be able
to get someone to send you
a faculty ID.

46:45.479 --> 46:47.278
<i> And your passport.</i>

46:47.280 --> 46:51.315
<i> Because I need you back here</i>
<i> in new haven, in three days.</i>

46:51.317 --> 46:53.383
Three days?
<i> Yes, and listen,</i>

46:53.385 --> 46:55.952
<i> when I told the folks</i>
<i> down in publishing that</i>
<i> you might be back home,</i>

46:55.954 --> 46:59.388
<i> they wanted me to ask</i>
<i> if you know munro's books</i>
<i> in Seattle.</i>

46:59.390 --> 47:01.022
Yeah. I've heard of it.

47:01.024 --> 47:02.757
Okay, well,
since you're there,

47:02.759 --> 47:04.692
they would be thrilled
if you could do a signing.

47:04.694 --> 47:06.994
<i> They'll just add it</i>
<i> to their big Christmas push.</i>

47:06.996 --> 47:09.629
<i> I'm gonna have someone</i>
<i> set that up for you, okay?</i>

47:09.631 --> 47:11.030
Okay, great, yeah.

47:11.032 --> 47:13.565
Um, when?
They suggested tomorrow.

47:13.567 --> 47:15.066
We'll tell them 1:00.

47:15.068 --> 47:16.667
I'll have a car sent
to your grandfather's.

47:16.669 --> 47:17.968
<i> Cool. Great.</i>

47:18.469 --> 47:19.735
Dean...

47:23.373 --> 47:26.908
So, it turns out I have
two million dollars.

47:26.910 --> 47:30.911
Well, if that's a problem...

47:32.480 --> 47:34.047
You can give it to me.

47:42.220 --> 47:44.721
So, the service should be
over around 4:00,

47:44.723 --> 47:46.022
we'll do the photos
until 5:00,

47:46.024 --> 47:47.890
and then it's on to ginos.

47:47.892 --> 47:49.958
There was this huge problem
with the floral arrangements,

47:49.960 --> 47:53.428
but gino got it all
sorted out for us,
and now we're good to go.

47:56.865 --> 47:58.198
Hello?

47:59.333 --> 48:01.167
Jason, did you hear me?
Sorry.

48:01.169 --> 48:02.768
Yeah, got it.

48:02.770 --> 48:04.369
You okay?

48:04.371 --> 48:05.503
Of course.

48:06.004 --> 48:07.371
So, we're good?

48:08.606 --> 48:09.973
Absolutely.

48:13.476 --> 48:14.542
You sure?

48:15.644 --> 48:16.777
Yeah.

48:16.779 --> 48:18.578
Yeah, why wouldn't
i be? Why?

48:19.913 --> 48:22.281
Nothing, I just, uh...

48:22.283 --> 48:24.449
I'm sorry,
am I imagining things?

48:24.451 --> 48:27.251
I just feel your energy's been
a little bit off lately.

48:27.253 --> 48:28.418
Energy?

48:31.422 --> 48:34.891
Okay, look, to be honest,
i have been thinking,
you know,

48:34.893 --> 48:37.026
was ginos the best choice?

48:39.763 --> 48:41.796
Jason, what are you
talking about?
You chose ginos.

48:41.798 --> 48:45.899
Yeah, I know, I realize that,
but, I don't know, I just...

48:45.901 --> 48:49.002
I worry that maybe it's
not big enough.

48:49.004 --> 48:50.703
You want to do that now?

48:50.705 --> 48:52.137
You know, it's pretty
last-minute.

48:52.139 --> 48:53.738
I don't know
if we're going to find

48:53.740 --> 48:55.005
another place and...
You know, you're right.

48:55.007 --> 48:56.039
You're right, you're right.

48:56.041 --> 48:57.306
Dumb idea, never mind.

49:02.578 --> 49:03.644
Hey.

49:06.781 --> 49:08.181
This is about her.

49:08.183 --> 49:10.616
What? No, it's not.

49:10.618 --> 49:13.051
Come on, Jason, you haven't
been yourself from the moment
i told you she was in town.

49:13.053 --> 49:14.318
Come on,
that's not true. I...

49:14.320 --> 49:17.788
Yes, it is,
and it's okay.

49:17.790 --> 49:20.657
All right, I get it,
you have a history
with Lindsay.

49:20.659 --> 49:22.392
All right?
She broke your heart.

49:22.394 --> 49:25.661
And now, all of a sudden,
she's back.

49:28.765 --> 49:33.168
Listen, I'm sorry if
I've been distracted, okay?

49:33.170 --> 49:35.503
But I promise you,
that's all it is.

49:36.872 --> 49:38.138
I love you.

49:38.140 --> 49:39.873
I'm gonna marry you.

49:39.875 --> 49:44.677
And whatever
Lindsay and I had,
it's ancient history.

49:45.545 --> 49:46.611
Ancient history?

49:48.814 --> 49:51.081
Okay, well,

49:51.083 --> 49:52.949
I would just like you
to go and talk to her.

49:53.550 --> 49:54.583
What?
Please?

49:54.585 --> 49:56.952
I don't need to...
Please?

49:56.954 --> 49:58.954
Come on,
just do it for me.

50:00.089 --> 50:01.889
Because when we are
standing by that altar,

50:01.891 --> 50:05.258
I have to know that it is me
that you're thinking of.

50:05.859 --> 50:07.092
Okay?

50:07.094 --> 50:09.027
Not the one that got away.

50:12.931 --> 50:15.198
Okay, yeah.

50:32.848 --> 50:34.080
Dr. Rogers?
Hi.

50:34.082 --> 50:35.781
Good morning.
My name is Richard,

50:35.783 --> 50:37.682
and I'm here to take you
down to munro's books.

50:37.684 --> 50:39.183
Okay, great. Do you
want to come in?

50:39.185 --> 50:40.717
I'm going to be
a few minutes.

50:40.719 --> 50:42.618
Uh, that's all right,
I'll wait by the car.

50:42.620 --> 50:46.587
But I was, however,
instructed to hand you these.

50:46.589 --> 50:48.121
Wow!

50:48.123 --> 50:51.224
Uh, okay. Great.
Thank you.

51:09.844 --> 51:11.043
Look at you!

51:11.045 --> 51:12.711
Do you see this blouse?

51:12.713 --> 51:15.180
Three-hundred dollars.
Still had the price tag on it.

51:15.182 --> 51:17.015
Whoa!

51:18.017 --> 51:20.385
I mean, am I dreaming?

51:20.387 --> 51:22.754
This is real life, right?

51:22.756 --> 51:24.188
Looks real to me.

51:37.302 --> 51:38.668
Okay, seriously?

51:40.003 --> 51:42.671
I must say, it's a real
honor to meet you.

51:42.673 --> 51:44.072
I read your book,

51:44.074 --> 51:46.240
and it really changed
my perspective on things.

51:46.242 --> 51:47.674
Oh, thank you.

51:47.676 --> 51:49.042
Lindsay.

51:50.511 --> 51:51.644
Hey.

51:51.646 --> 51:53.679
This is a surprise.

51:53.681 --> 51:56.347
Yeah, sorry, I would've
called you, but I don't
have your number anymore.

51:57.082 --> 51:58.348
That's okay.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.382
Um...

52:00.384 --> 52:01.783
Can I talk to you
for a second?

52:02.851 --> 52:04.184
Okay.

52:05.786 --> 52:07.086
Over here.

52:11.424 --> 52:14.559
I just... I never felt good
about how we left things.

52:16.995 --> 52:22.199
Does it matter? I mean,
you and Becca
are getting married.

52:22.201 --> 52:24.668
I think some closure
would be good.

52:24.670 --> 52:25.835
Don't you?

52:26.937 --> 52:28.304
Closure, right.

52:28.306 --> 52:30.139
Excuse me, miss?

52:30.141 --> 52:32.241
I'm sorry, but if we're going
to get there on time,

52:32.243 --> 52:34.743
we must really be
on our way.

52:34.745 --> 52:36.578
Right, of course.
I'll be right there.

52:36.580 --> 52:38.746
I'm sorry, I have to go
do this thing in Seattle,

52:38.748 --> 52:41.115
but maybe we can,
i don't know,
talk when I get back?

52:41.117 --> 52:42.549
Yeah, that'd be great.

52:42.551 --> 52:43.683
Okay.

52:46.119 --> 52:48.753
Actually, you know,
would it be okay if i
brought along a guest?

52:48.755 --> 52:51.388
Oh, of course, miss,
whatever you wish.

52:51.390 --> 52:54.090
Okay. Hey, maybe we could
talk on the way,

52:54.092 --> 52:56.325
if you want to
come with me?

52:56.327 --> 52:57.859
It's okay if you don't,
i understand.

52:57.861 --> 52:59.293
No, that'd be great.

52:59.295 --> 53:00.694
I mean, it's not like
they can fire me

53:00.696 --> 53:01.861
if I don't show up
for work, right? So...

53:03.464 --> 53:05.130
Okay.
Yeah.

53:09.067 --> 53:12.135
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

53:12.137 --> 53:15.104
This is how
you're rolling, huh?

53:18.141 --> 53:19.641
All this is for us?

53:19.643 --> 53:22.777
Yes, miss, help yourself
to anything you'd like.

53:25.414 --> 53:27.280
Can you believe this?

53:30.017 --> 53:32.752
Okay, so, um,
closure...

53:32.754 --> 53:35.521
Well, look, I just feel like
if we hurt each other,

53:35.523 --> 53:39.157
maybe we can take some
responsibility now
and move on.

53:39.159 --> 53:42.527
I mean,
it's about time, right?

53:42.529 --> 53:45.595
Yeah, uh, it doesn't seem
that long ago to me.

53:46.997 --> 53:48.530
Really?

53:48.532 --> 53:50.832
But, um, it was
a monumental choice,

53:50.834 --> 53:53.067
and you didn't really give me
a chance to work it out.

53:53.069 --> 53:55.803
When I visited you at Yale,
it definitely felt like you
had worked it out.

53:56.905 --> 53:58.405
I don't remember that.

53:58.407 --> 54:00.240
Selective memory.

54:01.308 --> 54:03.742
No, I mean,
i literally don't recall...

54:05.544 --> 54:06.677
Never mind.

54:06.679 --> 54:09.680
Well, you had, like,
bought furniture.

54:09.682 --> 54:11.548
You had plants
and everything.

54:11.550 --> 54:14.317
It was like you were
all settled in, you know?

54:14.319 --> 54:16.786
And let's be real,
you didn't come back.

54:16.788 --> 54:19.955
You asked me to marry you
right after I was given
the chance of a lifetime.

54:19.957 --> 54:24.526
I had just hoped that
i was going to be the chance
of a lifetime for you.

54:49.249 --> 54:50.549
Have you read it?

54:50.551 --> 54:52.217
It's amazing, isn't it?

54:52.219 --> 54:54.152
I couldn't put it down,
honestly.

54:55.788 --> 54:58.388
Hey.
Shall we start in five?

54:58.390 --> 55:00.156
Oh, hey, thank you so
much for coming.

55:00.158 --> 55:01.891
It's so exciting
having you here.

55:01.893 --> 55:04.293
You should see the line-up,
down the block.

55:04.295 --> 55:05.327
I'm gonna have to
lock the door.

55:14.467 --> 55:16.568
You all right?

55:16.570 --> 55:18.870
I am so not ready for this.

55:18.872 --> 55:20.504
Are you kidding?

55:20.506 --> 55:23.540
This crowd will be nothing
compared to your
Ivy league classes.

55:29.913 --> 55:30.979
Look, don't be nervous.

55:30.981 --> 55:32.780
Oh, I'm not nervous.

55:32.782 --> 55:35.815
I think I'd describe it
as abject terror.
Seriously?

55:37.551 --> 55:40.352
Hey, look,
remember sixth grade?

55:40.354 --> 55:42.887
Yeah.
End-of-year play?

55:42.889 --> 55:44.588
Oh, no, don't do that.
<i> The wizard of oz?</i>

55:44.590 --> 55:46.590
No, don't do it.
Oh, I'm gonna do it.

55:46.592 --> 55:47.958
No, really, don't do it.

55:47.960 --> 55:50.527
"What makes the hottentot
so hot?"

55:50.529 --> 55:51.628
You're so bad at...

55:51.630 --> 55:53.730
"Who puts the 'ape'
in ape-ricot?"

55:53.732 --> 55:55.598
You haven't gotten
any better.

55:56.666 --> 55:58.800
You haven't gotten any better.

55:58.802 --> 56:02.402
"What do they got
that I ain't got?"

56:06.839 --> 56:09.340
Courage.
Courage!

56:09.342 --> 56:10.774
See? You know.

56:10.776 --> 56:15.078
So just go on out there and
summon that inner courage.

56:15.080 --> 56:20.549
"What makes the elephant
charge his tusk in the misty
mist or the dusky dusk?"

56:20.551 --> 56:21.917
Okay! I don't know
what I'm going to say,

56:21.919 --> 56:23.585
but I'm leaving,
just to get away from you.

56:23.587 --> 56:25.920
Hey, just suck up to
the audience, you know.

56:25.922 --> 56:28.923
Thank them for coming,
and then just throw it
open to questions

56:28.925 --> 56:30.357
and see what happens.

56:30.359 --> 56:32.092
Okay, but what if nobody
asks me anything?

56:35.129 --> 56:36.895
Okay.

56:44.969 --> 56:47.070
So, without further delay,

56:47.072 --> 56:51.740
it is my great pleasure
to introduce to you our
special guest this afternoon,

56:51.742 --> 56:54.042
Dr. Lindsay Rogers!

57:01.615 --> 57:03.649
Thank you. Thanks.
It's very kind.

57:03.651 --> 57:06.985
Thank you. Thank you
very much. Thank you.

57:06.987 --> 57:09.988
Uh...

57:09.990 --> 57:15.059
So, uh, first off, I want to,
um, thank you all for coming.

57:15.061 --> 57:19.930
I'm very honored that there's
so many of you, so thank you.

57:19.932 --> 57:22.332
So, today, I figure,
since we put this
together fast,

57:22.334 --> 57:24.767
maybe we could open the floor
to some questions?

57:24.769 --> 57:30.072
Maybe there's some
things that you want
me to talk about.

57:30.074 --> 57:34.408
Um, sure, yeah, how about
we start with that man
there in the back?

57:34.410 --> 57:36.643
Oh, uh, me?

57:36.645 --> 57:39.846
You mean the handsome and
charming man you've known
since the sixth grade,

57:39.848 --> 57:42.915
but who, in no way,
could be considered a plant?

57:44.385 --> 57:46.351
Yeah, sure.

57:46.353 --> 57:48.486
If the handsome and charming
man that I've known
since the sixth grade,

57:48.488 --> 57:50.821
but who, in no way,
could be considered a plant,
has a question,

57:50.823 --> 57:52.989
go for it.
Great.

57:52.991 --> 57:54.724
Uh, well,
it's not in the book,
but I happen to know that

57:54.726 --> 57:56.158
you and your parents
are very close,

57:56.160 --> 57:58.260
and even though your father
is no longer with us,

57:58.262 --> 58:00.929
I know they had
a deep impact on you.

58:00.931 --> 58:03.865
Would you say that they
inspired you to write a book
about becoming inspired?

58:03.867 --> 58:06.934
See what I did there?
Inspired about being inspired?

58:06.936 --> 58:08.869
Yeah, thank you.
I caught it the first time.

58:10.839 --> 58:14.540
Actually,
i love that question.

58:14.542 --> 58:16.308
You know, this is the time
of year when we're all asked

58:16.310 --> 58:19.711
to consider the importance
of goodwill,

58:19.713 --> 58:23.714
but for my parents,
every day was like Christmas.

58:23.716 --> 58:26.717
They found joy in service
and in giving.

58:26.719 --> 58:28.585
They never won
any fancy awards,

58:28.587 --> 58:30.820
and they didn't get
much recognition,

58:30.822 --> 58:32.454
but, man,
did they affect people.

58:32.456 --> 58:36.124
My dad, John,
was a social worker.

58:36.126 --> 58:40.327
He was what I would term
a "compassionate empath."

58:40.329 --> 58:42.329
"Everyone deserves kindness."

58:42.331 --> 58:43.763
Those were his words.

58:43.765 --> 58:45.331
And my mom, Shannon,

58:45.333 --> 58:47.433
well, I think I was
about five

58:47.435 --> 58:50.736
when she told me
that her job was to help
children climb mountains.

58:50.738 --> 58:55.373
I was probably 10
when I realized that she was
actually a history teacher.

58:55.375 --> 58:58.743
But now, here I am,

58:58.745 --> 59:02.146
helping people climb their
own metaphorical mountains.

59:02.148 --> 59:04.615
And then there's my
grandfather, Robert.

59:05.416 --> 59:07.016
Always with a smile,

59:07.018 --> 59:10.152
and always with a gentle
word of encouragement.

59:10.154 --> 59:12.787
He taught me what it means
to love unconditionally.

59:14.956 --> 59:20.025
And that, in itself,
is truly inspiring.

59:21.627 --> 59:25.162
All right, anyone else
with questions?

59:31.869 --> 59:33.836
Can you make it
out to Joan?

59:38.741 --> 59:41.109
There you go.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

59:41.111 --> 59:42.710
Dr. Rogers!

59:42.712 --> 59:43.977
It's me, ally.

59:43.979 --> 59:45.878
I am so excited
to see you here.

59:45.880 --> 59:48.447
Yeah, hi! How...
How are you?

59:48.449 --> 59:50.182
I am doing amazingly.

59:50.184 --> 59:52.450
Good. I'm really happy
to hear that.
Oh, yeah.

59:52.452 --> 59:55.553
Taking your course last year
changed my life.

59:55.555 --> 59:57.922
I mean, sure,
dad's super-upset
i dropped out

59:57.924 --> 01:00:00.557
of the mba program
at Yale.
Oh, boy.

01:00:00.559 --> 01:00:03.326
But my mom, she is just
so happy to hear that

01:00:03.328 --> 01:00:05.494
I've decided to be
true to myself.

01:00:05.496 --> 01:00:07.429
Good, well, you know,
that's what's important, so...

01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:08.530
Yeah, I know, right?

01:00:08.532 --> 01:00:10.532
I'm pursuing cosmetology.

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:12.733
Ah.

01:00:12.735 --> 01:00:14.201
Did I know that's what
you were interested in?

01:00:14.203 --> 01:00:16.336
Yeah. I mean,
i like to think of it

01:00:16.338 --> 01:00:19.272
as giving people more
confidence in themselves.

01:00:19.274 --> 01:00:20.306
Just like you taught.

01:00:21.876 --> 01:00:24.209
Do you remember
that essay that I wrote
for you last year?

01:00:24.211 --> 01:00:26.678
You know, the one that you
read the whole class?

01:00:27.813 --> 01:00:29.914
The essay.
Yeah, the essay.

01:00:31.082 --> 01:00:32.816
It was so good.

01:00:32.818 --> 01:00:35.485
Do you remember
what you said to me?

01:00:35.487 --> 01:00:38.387
Well, I mean, I don't
remember the exact wording.

01:00:38.389 --> 01:00:41.089
Oh, man, it changed
my perspective.

01:00:41.091 --> 01:00:43.091
I mean, it gave me
the confidence that I needed

01:00:43.093 --> 01:00:44.992
to just, you know,
make that decision.

01:00:44.994 --> 01:00:47.160
Right.
Right, right. Right.
Yeah.

01:00:47.162 --> 01:00:49.028
Could you inscribe it
for me in the book?

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:51.263
Uh...

01:00:51.265 --> 01:00:53.331
You don't need me to
validate you anymore.

01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:55.266
Oh, but it meant so much.

01:00:55.268 --> 01:00:56.333
Please?

01:01:01.004 --> 01:01:03.271
I mean, I don't remember
the exact wording.

01:01:03.273 --> 01:01:05.306
I'm sorry, I couldn't
help but overhear.

01:01:05.308 --> 01:01:06.707
Lindsay's an old
friend of mine,

01:01:06.709 --> 01:01:08.442
and I just love to hear
these stories.

01:01:08.444 --> 01:01:09.910
What was it that she said?

01:01:09.912 --> 01:01:11.645
She just said...
She said,

01:01:11.647 --> 01:01:16.182
"be brave, be bold,
live the life you were
born to live.

01:01:16.184 --> 01:01:19.317
"There is no higher peak
than self-enlightenment."

01:01:20.319 --> 01:01:21.652
Just genius.

01:01:22.954 --> 01:01:24.721
She's so good.
Yeah.

01:01:26.624 --> 01:01:28.857
There you go.
Thank you so much.

01:01:28.859 --> 01:01:31.292
You're so welcome.
Could you take our photo?

01:01:31.294 --> 01:01:33.093
Yeah.
Okay.

01:01:33.095 --> 01:01:36.396
Thanks. Okay.
One, two, three.
"Inspired!"

01:01:36.398 --> 01:01:37.563
Yeah.
Thank you.

01:01:37.565 --> 01:01:39.665
Okay.
See you later.

01:01:40.199 --> 01:01:41.632
Wow!

01:01:42.734 --> 01:01:44.634
Well...

01:01:45.836 --> 01:01:48.037
Oh, my gosh.

01:01:48.039 --> 01:01:52.140
Okay, I think I can safely say
that I would have crashed
and burned without you here.

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:55.977
My whole writing career,
professional success, over.

01:01:55.979 --> 01:01:57.011
No.

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:58.979
Well, yeah, probably.

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:00.513
Yeah, definitely.

01:02:00.515 --> 01:02:01.981
Just kidding.

01:02:01.983 --> 01:02:03.983
Well, thank you.

01:02:03.985 --> 01:02:07.119
I'm... I'm just...
I'm glad you came.

01:02:12.391 --> 01:02:14.491
All the way up,
all the way up,
all the way up,

01:02:14.493 --> 01:02:16.159
and the rest for you.
And the rest
is for me.

01:02:16.161 --> 01:02:17.760
That's enough, that's enough,
that's enough.

01:02:17.762 --> 01:02:18.894
Just topper-upper.
A little more for you.

01:02:18.896 --> 01:02:20.295
Yeah, well.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.464
All right.
Cheers.

01:02:23.466 --> 01:02:24.765
Cheers.

01:02:26.335 --> 01:02:28.668
To our successes.

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:31.737
This is clearly the life
that you were supposed
to live.

01:02:32.405 --> 01:02:33.805
You're happy, right?

01:02:35.908 --> 01:02:37.908
What? What?
I...

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:39.509
I... you're
getting married!

01:02:39.511 --> 01:02:40.943
I know.
It's like...

01:02:40.945 --> 01:02:42.377
Cheers.
Yeah, cheers.

01:02:42.379 --> 01:02:44.278
I never imagined
that you and Becca...

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.581
But you're happy, right?

01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:49.015
I mean,
you're really, you're...
You're happy with her?

01:02:49.017 --> 01:02:51.417
Yeah, of course.

01:02:52.953 --> 01:02:55.219
Well, that's all I ever really
wanted for you, so...

01:02:57.055 --> 01:02:59.256
That's all I wanted
for you, too.

01:03:00.358 --> 01:03:01.758
What about you?

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.493
Is there a guy?

01:03:08.397 --> 01:03:10.765
No?
Really?

01:03:10.767 --> 01:03:14.502
Well, I mean, I'm sure
I've dated, but, um...

01:03:14.504 --> 01:03:16.904
Well, I mean, there's no ring
here on this finger,

01:03:16.906 --> 01:03:20.307
so I guess
I'm still single.

01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:22.309
Guys on the east coast
are clearly crazy then.

01:03:22.311 --> 01:03:24.811
They don't know a good thing
when they see it.

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:39.791
Can you stop
the car, please?

01:03:39.793 --> 01:03:41.058
- Can you just pull over?
- What?

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.693
I just... I'm sorry,
but I should go.

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:45.428
Wait. Wait.
Sorry.

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:47.596
Congratulations on everything.
You really deserve it.

01:03:47.598 --> 01:03:49.464
- Wait.
- Ma'am?

01:03:49.466 --> 01:03:52.833
Are we going?
I just... sorry.
Just hold on. Wait.

01:03:53.534 --> 01:03:54.934
Jason!

01:03:57.403 --> 01:03:58.803
Jason?

01:04:00.806 --> 01:04:02.740
Jason, would you hold on?

01:04:02.742 --> 01:04:04.007
No, I...

01:04:04.009 --> 01:04:05.541
I'm just...

01:04:05.543 --> 01:04:07.109
Listen, I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna call Becca to...

01:04:07.111 --> 01:04:08.543
Please don't do that.

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:10.111
I... it's been years,
and you show up now?

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:12.079
It wasn't intentional.
I'm sure.

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:14.414
Jason, I just found out
about all this.

01:04:14.416 --> 01:04:16.315
I'm sorry that
i hurt you, all right?

01:04:16.317 --> 01:04:18.884
I'm sorry that
i showed up at the
worst possible moment,

01:04:18.886 --> 01:04:21.086
but I'm kind of having
a hard time wrapping
my head around all this.

01:04:21.088 --> 01:04:22.854
It's a lot to take in.

01:04:22.856 --> 01:04:24.655
One day, you ask me
to marry you,

01:04:24.657 --> 01:04:26.490
and the next day,
you're marrying
someone else.

01:04:26.492 --> 01:04:28.091
Life moves on
for all of us.

01:04:28.093 --> 01:04:30.560
What if I can't
move on that fast?

01:04:30.562 --> 01:04:34.096
What does that mean?
How do you expect me
to respond to that?

01:04:36.999 --> 01:04:38.766
Jason, wait.
How did this happen?

01:04:38.768 --> 01:04:39.967
Can we not do this?

01:04:39.969 --> 01:04:41.468
I'd rather not rehash Yale.

01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:44.070
Well, obviously,
we didn't resolve it.

01:04:45.539 --> 01:04:47.706
I don't know
what you want me to say.

01:04:47.708 --> 01:04:49.708
Do you want me
to apologize?

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:52.444
I admit I was not very
understanding when we
saw each other,

01:04:52.446 --> 01:04:53.578
but I was angry.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.980
No, I was furious.

01:04:55.982 --> 01:04:58.348
Look, it's yesterday's
news, right?

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:01.617
So, you fell for Becca.

01:05:03.019 --> 01:05:04.452
Becca is an amazing woman.

01:05:04.454 --> 01:05:06.854
She's been the best thing
in my life.

01:05:06.856 --> 01:05:08.856
We share the same passions.

01:05:08.858 --> 01:05:10.457
She's been my rock.

01:05:10.459 --> 01:05:12.926
And unlike some people,
who shall remain nameless,

01:05:12.928 --> 01:05:14.928
she didn't run away
and move clear
across the country

01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:17.030
when I asked her to spend
the rest of her life with me,

01:05:17.032 --> 01:05:19.132
so that was a definite
improvement.

01:05:19.134 --> 01:05:21.834
I never wanted to say
no to you.

01:05:21.836 --> 01:05:24.203
Yes, you did. You just
didn't want to admit it.

01:05:26.807 --> 01:05:28.039
- Hello?
<i>- Oh, hi, Jason.</i>

01:05:28.041 --> 01:05:29.473
<i> It's bill here.</i>

01:05:29.475 --> 01:05:31.341
Hi, I am so sorry,
i totally spaced.

01:05:31.343 --> 01:05:32.742
<i> Oh, but you're coming?</i>
Yeah, wait there.

01:05:32.744 --> 01:05:34.009
I'm on my way.

01:05:34.011 --> 01:05:36.478
I, um... I got to go.
What's wrong?

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.146
I'm supposed to meet
the plumber at the cafe.

01:05:38.148 --> 01:05:40.114
Well, let me drop you off.

01:05:40.116 --> 01:05:42.282
I show up in a limo,
the guy's sure to gouge me
more than he is already.

01:05:42.284 --> 01:05:44.717
Jason, he is waiting,
I've got a car. Come on.

01:05:44.719 --> 01:05:46.351
We can ditch it
when we get closer.

01:05:48.654 --> 01:05:50.154
Okay, thanks.

01:05:58.729 --> 01:06:00.096
Perfect. Thanks.

01:06:00.098 --> 01:06:02.298
All right, bill.

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.999
Jason, it looks
so great in here.

01:06:04.767 --> 01:06:05.833
Thanks.

01:06:05.835 --> 01:06:07.134
I think so.

01:06:07.136 --> 01:06:08.468
But you know what
my favorite part is?

01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:10.102
It's the people.

01:06:10.104 --> 01:06:12.404
Yeah, I know,
it sounds hokey,
but it's true.

01:06:12.406 --> 01:06:15.073
I love the people
that we serve.

01:06:15.075 --> 01:06:17.708
Our regulars, you know,
they start to feel
like family.

01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:20.811
I love hearing about
Millie o'Doyle's
latest escapade

01:06:20.813 --> 01:06:23.079
with her French bulldog,
Pierre.

01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:27.316
And I am completely invested
in Tim Ludwig's son,

01:06:27.318 --> 01:06:29.785
ritchie, getting into
law school.

01:06:29.787 --> 01:06:31.486
This is where he studies.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.588
And then,
remember Cassie Wilder?

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:36.924
I mean, she's always got
some ridiculous story
about online dating.

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:38.859
She's hilarious.

01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:42.462
Every once in a while,
you know, we get
some jerk in here,

01:06:42.464 --> 01:06:48.033
but when we do, I just remind
myself that Millie and Pierre
will be back soon.

01:06:49.502 --> 01:06:51.436
You're an amazing
guy, Jason.

01:06:53.105 --> 01:06:56.240
Life would have been
an incredible adventure
with you.

01:06:59.744 --> 01:07:01.478
Becca is a very
lucky woman.
No.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.213
I'm getting the better
part of that deal...

01:07:03.215 --> 01:07:04.681
No, I mean it.
I really...
Trust me.

01:07:05.983 --> 01:07:08.150
You have no idea how much...

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:18.625
It's okay.

01:07:38.712 --> 01:07:40.112
Right.

01:07:48.387 --> 01:07:51.622
Why didn't you ask me
to go with you?

01:07:51.624 --> 01:07:56.393
It felt like you were
asking me to choose
between my life and yours.

01:07:58.429 --> 01:08:00.930
I don't know,
i wish I could do it
all over again, you know?

01:08:00.932 --> 01:08:01.997
I mean, I...

01:08:01.999 --> 01:08:03.965
I don't...

01:08:03.967 --> 01:08:06.400
Lindsay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:08:17.178 --> 01:08:20.513
Okay, so maybe we better
cancel ginos after all.

01:08:21.314 --> 01:08:24.049
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:08:48.906 --> 01:08:50.506
Okay, like,
two minutes.

01:08:50.508 --> 01:08:51.673
Less.

01:08:52.608 --> 01:08:53.741
Wait!

01:08:54.676 --> 01:08:56.143
Wait, listen, I...

01:08:56.145 --> 01:08:57.978
I really have to be
with Becca,

01:08:57.979 --> 01:08:59.379
right now.
Of course.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.446
Of course.

01:09:04.716 --> 01:09:09.652
So, uh...
I'm gonna go now.

01:09:09.654 --> 01:09:10.819
Yeah, okay.

01:09:10.821 --> 01:09:12.319
I'm gonna go, too.

01:09:12.621 --> 01:09:13.754
Okay.

01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:24.997
Just tell me one thing.

01:09:24.999 --> 01:09:28.131
If I had asked you
to come with me,
what would have happened?

01:09:29.267 --> 01:09:30.800
Where would our lives
be now?

01:09:33.571 --> 01:09:36.671
I guess we'll never know,
will we?

01:09:51.153 --> 01:09:53.520
Got everything?

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:54.855
ID?

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.656
Keys to your house?

01:09:56.658 --> 01:09:59.058
Yup. It's all here
in the package that
Dean Jackman sent me.

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.726
And you have your address?

01:10:00.728 --> 01:10:04.062
They have a car
picking me up
from the airport.

01:10:04.064 --> 01:10:08.265
I'm sorry I have to go.
Hey, my Christmas
is complete this year.

01:10:08.267 --> 01:10:10.734
I got to see you in person.

01:10:10.736 --> 01:10:13.870
And in a few days,
i get to see you on TV.

01:10:21.445 --> 01:10:23.879
Why can't a person
have it all?

01:10:23.881 --> 01:10:25.313
Who says you can't?

01:10:25.881 --> 01:10:26.947
I have to say,

01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:31.451
I'm a pretty lucky man.

01:10:31.453 --> 01:10:34.053
I had a beautiful wife,

01:10:34.055 --> 01:10:35.754
a wonderful daughter,

01:10:35.756 --> 01:10:38.089
a granddaughter I couldn't
be more proud of.

01:10:39.592 --> 01:10:41.258
So, no regrets?

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:42.692
Maybe.

01:10:42.694 --> 01:10:44.427
Some, I suppose.

01:10:44.429 --> 01:10:48.664
But no point on dwelling
on them, though.

01:10:48.666 --> 01:10:51.066
I mean, just look
at Mrs. Jamison.

01:10:51.068 --> 01:10:56.036
What about her?
There's a woman
filled with regrets.

01:10:56.038 --> 01:10:59.172
She was a dancer, you know,
when she was young.

01:10:59.174 --> 01:11:00.640
I didn't know that.

01:11:00.642 --> 01:11:03.009
Then she met bill Jamison.

01:11:03.011 --> 01:11:06.312
Fell in love, got married.

01:11:06.314 --> 01:11:08.947
He didn't want her working.

01:11:08.949 --> 01:11:11.849
Then he died when
she was about 30.

01:11:13.518 --> 01:11:16.052
That creates unhappiness.

01:11:16.054 --> 01:11:20.422
A lifetime of what-ifs
and what-could-have-beens.

01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:22.557
No good.

01:11:37.639 --> 01:11:38.872
Thanks.

01:11:42.542 --> 01:11:44.976
I don't want to go.

01:11:44.978 --> 01:11:47.044
You've got to give it a try.

01:11:47.046 --> 01:11:51.615
Maybe when you get home,
it'll all come back to you.

01:11:52.783 --> 01:11:54.617
Uh...

01:11:55.685 --> 01:11:57.252
Go.

01:11:57.254 --> 01:11:59.053
You're gonna miss your plane.

01:12:31.485 --> 01:12:32.852
Thank you.

01:13:24.798 --> 01:13:26.532
The dalai lama?

01:13:26.534 --> 01:13:29.034
How can I forget meeting
the dalai lama?

01:13:48.114 --> 01:13:49.645
I'm coming!

01:13:52.015 --> 01:13:53.882
I'm coming.

01:13:53.884 --> 01:13:55.049
I'm coming.

01:13:55.051 --> 01:13:56.450
I'm coming.

01:13:56.452 --> 01:13:58.785
Hey. What are you
wearing?
Hello.

01:13:58.787 --> 01:14:01.821
Ashley noon and <i> the noon show</i>
will be here any minute!

01:14:01.823 --> 01:14:03.656
Um, okay.

01:14:03.658 --> 01:14:05.524
Did you pick out one
of the Christmas dresses
like you promised?

01:14:05.526 --> 01:14:07.058
Sorry, I guess it must have
slipped my mind.

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:08.392
I've been out of town.

01:14:08.394 --> 01:14:09.793
I knew it. Come on.

01:14:09.795 --> 01:14:11.828
Makeup and hair
are right behind me,

01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:13.396
and we have to pick out
a Christmas dress for
this afternoon as well.

01:14:13.398 --> 01:14:15.531
What would you do
without me?

01:14:15.533 --> 01:14:16.899
Who are you, again?

01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:18.901
Yeah, funny. Yeah.

01:14:22.071 --> 01:14:24.372
- It's in the shot?
- Okay, we're good.

01:14:24.374 --> 01:14:26.073
Just lower it
right into the shot.
Right between them.

01:14:26.075 --> 01:14:27.808
Okay, do we have
a line there?

01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:29.209
All right, everybody,
let's get out of the way.

01:14:29.211 --> 01:14:32.679
In five, four,
three, two...

01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:34.681
It's the more profound
goals in our lives

01:14:34.683 --> 01:14:37.583
that often get lost
in favor of the immediacy
of our day-to-day desires.

01:14:37.585 --> 01:14:40.919
You see, Ashley, most of us
have stopped asking ourselves

01:14:40.921 --> 01:14:43.154
what it is that
we truly want.

01:14:43.156 --> 01:14:45.122
Well, I know what I want.

01:14:45.124 --> 01:14:46.623
I want to know,

01:14:46.625 --> 01:14:49.025
how does a person who has
truly found inspiration

01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:51.827
plan on celebrating
the holiday season?

01:14:56.631 --> 01:14:58.164
Um...

01:14:59.699 --> 01:15:02.200
That's a really
good question.

01:15:09.175 --> 01:15:10.474
Hi, Sheila.

01:15:10.476 --> 01:15:11.908
One more, please.

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:13.876
There she is.

01:15:13.878 --> 01:15:16.111
- Merry Christmas!
- Yay!

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:19.046
Yes, that's right!

01:15:21.616 --> 01:15:23.583
Merry Christmas
goes to you.

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:25.184
Well, it's always great.

01:15:26.753 --> 01:15:28.919
Hey, hey, hey,
how are you all?

01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:31.888
Hey.

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:35.258
What happened to the chipper,
happy Lindsay Rogers?

01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:38.560
Sorry?
Come on,
it's Christmas Eve.

01:15:39.361 --> 01:15:41.428
Are you okay?

01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:46.198
Well, come tell Dr. cesares
about that cute astrophysicist
you met in Paris.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.499
I wish I could.

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:48.733
Lindsay.

01:15:48.735 --> 01:15:49.834
Can I steal her
for a sec?

01:15:49.836 --> 01:15:51.101
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

01:15:51.103 --> 01:15:52.602
You look lovely.

01:15:52.604 --> 01:15:54.203
Oh, thank you so much.

01:15:54.205 --> 01:15:56.138
I am about to give you

01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:59.474
the best Christmas present
you could ever ask for.

01:15:59.476 --> 01:16:01.042
You are?
Mmm-hmm.

01:16:02.944 --> 01:16:06.146
How does tenure
sound to you?

01:16:06.148 --> 01:16:07.213
Tenure?

01:16:09.249 --> 01:16:10.349
Really?

01:16:10.351 --> 01:16:11.583
Mmm-hmm.

01:16:11.585 --> 01:16:13.184
Oh.

01:16:13.186 --> 01:16:14.251
Go ahead.

01:16:16.153 --> 01:16:18.120
It's from Stockholm.
Go ahead, take it.

01:16:18.888 --> 01:16:20.088
Sorry.

01:16:21.324 --> 01:16:23.190
<i> Merry Christmas, </i>
<i>my darling.</i>

01:16:23.192 --> 01:16:24.424
Merry Christmas, mom.

01:16:24.426 --> 01:16:26.659
God jul, <i> Lindsay!</i>

01:16:26.661 --> 01:16:29.161
Oh, yeah.
God bless you, too.

01:16:30.664 --> 01:16:32.797
God jul <i> means </i>
<i> "merry Christmas," honey.</i>

01:16:32.799 --> 01:16:34.899
Right, right.

01:16:34.901 --> 01:16:37.801
<i> So you're spending</i>
<i> the holidays</i>
<i> with your friends?</i>

01:16:38.702 --> 01:16:40.402
I'm at a party.

01:16:40.404 --> 01:16:42.337
<i> Well, it's already</i>
<i> Christmas morning here,</i>

01:16:42.339 --> 01:16:45.373
<i> and we've been opening</i>
<i> our presents,</i>
<i> having a lovely time.</i>

01:16:45.375 --> 01:16:47.241
<i> Wishing you were here.</i>

01:16:47.243 --> 01:16:49.109
I wish you were here, mom.

01:16:49.111 --> 01:16:51.511
<i> What is it, honey?</i>
<i> What's wrong?</i>

01:16:51.513 --> 01:16:53.179
Nothing.

01:16:53.181 --> 01:16:54.613
What could be wrong?
I'm...

01:16:54.615 --> 01:16:56.514
Everything's great.

01:16:56.516 --> 01:16:58.282
I think I just got tenure.

01:16:59.652 --> 01:17:01.351
<i> Oh, my goodness.</i>

01:17:01.353 --> 01:17:03.453
<i> Stefan, Lindsay got tenure!</i>

01:17:03.455 --> 01:17:05.354
<i> Of course she did.</i>

01:17:05.356 --> 01:17:07.189
<i> Honey, I am beyond thrilled.</i>

01:17:07.191 --> 01:17:10.458
Yeah, yeah. Yeah,
it's a dream come true.

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:13.227
<i> So why doesn't it</i>
<i> sound like it?</i>

01:17:19.333 --> 01:17:20.500
I'm...

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:23.135
I'm so proud of all this,

01:17:23.137 --> 01:17:25.237
but it feels like
I'm making a mistake.

01:17:26.272 --> 01:17:27.872
I just want to go back.

01:17:27.874 --> 01:17:29.573
<i> To Washington?</i>

01:17:29.575 --> 01:17:32.509
<i> Oh, you know your grandfather</i>
<i> would sure love to have you.</i>

01:17:32.511 --> 01:17:33.810
No.

01:17:34.711 --> 01:17:36.244
No, I don't mean that.

01:17:36.246 --> 01:17:38.646
<i> What have you</i>
<i> told me 100 times?</i>

01:17:38.648 --> 01:17:43.082
<i> "An inspired life starts</i>
<i> with being truthful with</i>
<i> yourself," isn't that it?</i>

01:17:43.716 --> 01:17:45.116
Yeah, but...

01:17:46.118 --> 01:17:48.652
What if when you're
truthful with yourself,

01:17:48.654 --> 01:17:50.286
you can't get what you want?

01:17:50.288 --> 01:17:52.721
What if it's impossible?

01:17:52.723 --> 01:17:54.656
<i> Impossible?</i>

01:17:54.658 --> 01:17:56.991
<i> Honey, look around you.</i>

01:17:56.993 --> 01:18:00.594
<i> Now is the time of year</i>
<i> for the impossible</i>
<i> to become possible.</i>

01:18:00.596 --> 01:18:02.028
<i> It's Christmas.</i>

01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:04.196
<i> Magic is in the air.</i>
Magic's in the air.

01:18:19.545 --> 01:18:20.811
Thank you.

01:18:20.813 --> 01:18:22.245
Thanks!

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:31.686
Grandpa!

01:18:33.388 --> 01:18:36.323
Grandpa!
You came back!

01:18:37.726 --> 01:18:40.526
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

01:18:40.528 --> 01:18:42.461
Ah!

01:18:43.730 --> 01:18:45.830
Wait, what do you
remember?

01:18:45.832 --> 01:18:47.431
I remember what's important.

01:18:47.433 --> 01:18:49.032
That's my girl!

01:18:49.034 --> 01:18:50.733
Can I borrow
your car keys?

01:18:50.735 --> 01:18:52.034
Oh, you...

01:19:06.181 --> 01:19:07.381
Hi, sorry.

01:21:17.724 --> 01:21:21.359
Ho-ho-whoa,
baby. Whoa!

01:21:21.361 --> 01:21:22.493
Whoa!

01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:27.597
Easy, girl.

01:21:29.366 --> 01:21:33.969
I had a feeling
I'd find you here tonight.

01:21:38.806 --> 01:21:40.907
I talked to one
of the groundskeepers.

01:21:40.909 --> 01:21:43.709
He said he's never heard
of anybody giving out
carriage rides here,

01:21:43.711 --> 01:21:46.411
and he's worked here
for years.

01:21:46.413 --> 01:21:48.446
So I'm asking you,
who are you?

01:21:49.581 --> 01:21:51.114
I'm...

01:21:53.284 --> 01:21:54.850
Why don't you think of me
as someone who cares?

01:21:54.852 --> 01:21:56.451
That's all.

01:21:56.453 --> 01:21:58.352
Really? Are you serious?

01:21:58.354 --> 01:22:00.087
Yeah.
That's all you're
going to give me?

01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:02.455
What did you do to me?

01:22:05.325 --> 01:22:08.993
You look like someone who
could use a carriage ride.

01:22:08.995 --> 01:22:10.794
Yeah, I don't think so.

01:22:10.796 --> 01:22:13.296
Oh, come on, don't be afraid.
Come on up here.

01:22:13.298 --> 01:22:16.966
Besides, mistletoe and i
would enjoy your company.

01:22:29.912 --> 01:22:31.479
Step up there, mistletoe.

01:22:35.716 --> 01:22:36.982
Okay, so talk.

01:22:37.516 --> 01:22:39.216
Please.

01:22:39.218 --> 01:22:42.319
And please don't
give me any of this
"someone who cares" business.

01:22:42.321 --> 01:22:44.487
I don't know what
you want from me.

01:22:44.489 --> 01:22:47.022
Oh, come on, I don't
want to play games.

01:22:47.024 --> 01:22:48.556
I just...

01:22:48.558 --> 01:22:50.257
I need your help, okay?

01:22:50.259 --> 01:22:52.292
Of course.
What can I do for you?

01:22:52.294 --> 01:22:55.161
I don't know, maybe
filling me in on three years
of memories or something?

01:22:58.231 --> 01:23:00.498
Funny how life can be.

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:03.200
Sometimes

01:23:03.202 --> 01:23:06.101
all you need
is little perspective.

01:23:09.038 --> 01:23:11.139
Whoa!

01:23:11.141 --> 01:23:13.674
Am I going crazy
or something,

01:23:13.676 --> 01:23:17.577
or did this happen
the last time I saw you?

01:23:19.379 --> 01:23:20.912
Whoa!

01:23:34.791 --> 01:23:37.058
Whoa!

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:39.160
That's exactly what
happened last time.

01:23:57.745 --> 01:24:00.578
Please be there,
please be there,
please be there.

01:24:01.813 --> 01:24:03.079
Yes!

01:24:03.081 --> 01:24:04.547
Yes!

01:24:56.464 --> 01:24:58.764
Ryan! I just...
Professor Rogers, hey.

01:24:58.766 --> 01:25:01.599
Gosh, I love what you've done
with your window display.

01:25:02.467 --> 01:25:04.367
Okay.

01:25:04.369 --> 01:25:06.068
You know what I love
most about it?
It's full of books.

01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:07.469
Lots and lots
of different books.

01:25:07.471 --> 01:25:09.370
Do you know this is
a book store?

01:25:09.372 --> 01:25:10.871
And the best thing is
not one of them is mine.

01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:12.405
You wrote a book?

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:15.809
I did, but it's not here,
and it's not a bestseller.

01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:17.243
That's a good thing?

01:25:17.877 --> 01:25:19.444
Yes.

01:25:19.446 --> 01:25:21.245
See you.

01:25:21.247 --> 01:25:23.247
Oh, have a merry
Christmas, Ryan.

01:25:23.249 --> 01:25:25.115
Just have the merriest
Christmas ever.

01:25:25.117 --> 01:25:26.983
See you next semester!
Bye!

01:25:26.985 --> 01:25:28.718
Merry Christmas.
Bye, bye!

01:25:59.947 --> 01:26:01.213
I'm home.

01:26:07.118 --> 01:26:09.586
Honey?

01:26:09.588 --> 01:26:12.589
Honey, you had us
so worried.

01:26:14.059 --> 01:26:16.692
Sweetie, it's okay.

01:26:16.694 --> 01:26:18.927
It's all gonna work out,
you'll see.

01:26:18.929 --> 01:26:21.229
If you
don't want to marry Jason,
you don't marry Jason.

01:26:21.231 --> 01:26:22.563
Mom, it's okay.

01:26:24.032 --> 01:26:25.832
I love you so much.

01:26:25.834 --> 01:26:28.167
I never tell you
that enough.

01:26:29.936 --> 01:26:32.304
Grandpa!

01:26:32.306 --> 01:26:34.139
Merry Christmas!

01:26:34.141 --> 01:26:36.306
Merry Christmas.

01:26:38.008 --> 01:26:39.408
You okay there?

01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:41.009
Yeah.

01:26:41.011 --> 01:26:42.910
Did I ever tell you that
you're one of the finest men

01:26:42.912 --> 01:26:44.745
I've ever known?

01:26:44.747 --> 01:26:45.812
Ah!

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:49.048
I think you've just
given us both

01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:52.918
about the best
Christmas present anyone
could ever ask for.

01:26:54.454 --> 01:26:56.587
Now, grandpa.
Yeah?

01:26:56.589 --> 01:26:59.456
Do you want to know
what we're going to
do on Monday?

01:26:59.458 --> 01:27:02.258
We're taking this wonderful
woman to see the doctor.

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:03.559
What?
Yeah.

01:27:03.561 --> 01:27:05.160
You've been having
dizzy spells.

01:27:05.162 --> 01:27:06.528
You keep saying
that it's nothing,
but it's not.

01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:08.062
I'm fine.
No, mom.

01:27:08.064 --> 01:27:10.330
It's nothing to
worry about.
No.

01:27:10.332 --> 01:27:11.564
You have a problem,
so we're going to take you
to see a specialist, okay?

01:27:11.566 --> 01:27:12.898
Specialist?
Yeah.

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:14.332
And I know just
the perfect one.

01:27:14.334 --> 01:27:15.866
His name is
Dr. Stefan gustaf,

01:27:15.868 --> 01:27:17.934
and trust me,
you're going to love him.

01:27:17.936 --> 01:27:19.769
Now I have to go.

01:27:19.771 --> 01:27:21.303
There's someone else
i have to see.

01:27:21.305 --> 01:27:23.371
I love you. <i> God jul.</i>

01:27:23.373 --> 01:27:24.972
<i> God jul?</i>

01:27:26.307 --> 01:27:28.975
Dr. Stefan gustaf?

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:30.910
I don't know.

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:33.078
Sounds foreign to me.

01:27:40.451 --> 01:27:42.418
Good evening, Mrs. Jamison!

01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.921
Don't see what's
so good about it.

01:27:46.923 --> 01:27:50.257
Do you need help?
No!

01:27:50.259 --> 01:27:54.160
I didn't think so,
but I wanted to wish you
a merry Christmas anyways.

01:27:54.162 --> 01:27:55.494
Eh!

01:27:59.098 --> 01:28:00.231
Oh... Mrs. Jamison?

01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:02.733
What is it?
Can't you see I'm busy?

01:28:02.735 --> 01:28:04.401
I was wondering if you
might be available

01:28:04.403 --> 01:28:06.069
to come over and have
Christmas dinner with us?

01:28:06.071 --> 01:28:09.872
If you're free, that is,
'cause we'd love to have you.

01:28:13.443 --> 01:28:16.811
Oh, and did you know that
they're doing <i> the nutcracker</i>
down at mccaw hall?

01:28:16.813 --> 01:28:18.479
I understand that you
used to be a dancer,

01:28:18.481 --> 01:28:19.947
and I was going
to get tickets,

01:28:19.949 --> 01:28:22.549
and I would just love
if you could come with me.

01:28:22.551 --> 01:28:25.084
No, no, don't say no.

01:28:25.086 --> 01:28:26.518
Merry Christmas.

01:29:46.124 --> 01:29:47.524
Can I help you?

01:29:47.526 --> 01:29:50.593
<i> Scusate, scusi,</i>
<i> scusi, scusi...</i>

01:29:52.695 --> 01:29:53.961
What?

01:29:53.963 --> 01:29:55.729
You got a kitchen
in this place?

01:29:55.731 --> 01:29:57.263
Yeah, yeah,
it's just right here.

01:29:57.265 --> 01:29:59.331
But would somebody mind
telling me what's going on?

01:29:59.333 --> 01:30:02.600
Don't ask me,
ask <i> la signorina.</i>

01:30:08.806 --> 01:30:11.874
Jason, this has been...
Is...

01:30:11.876 --> 01:30:14.743
I mean, it will be the most
amazing Christmas of my life.

01:30:14.745 --> 01:30:16.644
Is that right?
Yeah.

01:30:16.646 --> 01:30:18.145
I was super-confused,
but then I met this guy,

01:30:18.147 --> 01:30:19.679
and there was mistletoe,

01:30:19.681 --> 01:30:20.946
and he took me
for this ride...

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:22.814
Wait, what?

01:30:22.816 --> 01:30:26.651
Never mind. Listen,
I'm not going to lie.

01:30:26.653 --> 01:30:28.185
There are things that I want
to do with my life,

01:30:28.187 --> 01:30:32.155
and Yale and publishing
a book are part of it.

01:30:32.157 --> 01:30:34.423
And I don't want to
have to throw that all away.

01:30:35.425 --> 01:30:38.493
But, Jason, any success
that I have,

01:30:38.495 --> 01:30:42.796
and I will be successful,
it won't matter if I can't
share it with you.

01:30:42.798 --> 01:30:45.131
So if you'll still have me,

01:30:45.133 --> 01:30:48.700
if you still want to marry me,
and you still want to give
me this ring, then...

01:30:50.502 --> 01:30:52.503
Then my answer is yes.

01:31:03.847 --> 01:31:05.881
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.

01:31:05.883 --> 01:31:10.451
This strange and mysterious
"Yale" of which you speak,

01:31:11.686 --> 01:31:14.354
you think they have
coffee shops there?

01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:17.790
We can Google it,
but I'm pretty sure they do.

01:31:17.792 --> 01:31:23.995
Okay then, can I propose that
you just accept this ring?

01:31:23.997 --> 01:31:27.298
Why don't we get married,
and why don't I look into
selling this place,

01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:29.700
and maybe opening
something in Connecticut?

01:31:29.702 --> 01:31:32.803
Okay, let's do that.
On one condition.

01:31:32.805 --> 01:31:34.171
If we ever have a child,

01:31:34.173 --> 01:31:36.873
and that child asks us
how we got engaged,

01:31:36.875 --> 01:31:40.142
can we please just tell them
that I popped the question
and you said, "yes"?

01:31:40.144 --> 01:31:42.144
Yeah. I can live with that.

01:31:48.282 --> 01:31:49.548
Let's eat!
Ah!

01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:51.283
All right!
This looks amazing.
Thank you!

01:31:51.285 --> 01:31:53.985
<i> Benvenuti.</i>
Hey, second time's
the charm, right?

01:31:53.987 --> 01:31:55.286
<i> Si, si, si, si.</i>

01:31:55.288 --> 01:31:56.353
Oh, thanks.

01:31:56.355 --> 01:31:58.188
Thank you.

01:31:58.190 --> 01:31:59.255
Thank you, gino.

01:32:10.299 --> 01:32:12.867
<i> Lindsay Anne Rogers,</i>

01:32:12.869 --> 01:32:15.336
you are the perk
in my percolator,

01:32:15.338 --> 01:32:17.371
the caffeine in my coffee,

01:32:17.373 --> 01:32:21.374
and I promise
i will follow you
wherever you go,

01:32:21.376 --> 01:32:22.808
till the ends of the earth.

01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:24.543
No, Connecticut should be
far enough.

01:32:25.846 --> 01:32:28.379
I vow to honor
and Cherish your wisdom,

01:32:28.381 --> 01:32:31.782
to make you dark chocolate
double espressos
whenever you want,

01:32:31.784 --> 01:32:33.917
in sickness and in health,

01:32:33.919 --> 01:32:35.618
till death do us part.

01:32:40.355 --> 01:32:42.055
Jason Michael Stewart,

01:32:42.057 --> 01:32:46.993
you give me the courage
to live an inspired life.

01:32:46.995 --> 01:32:50.763
I promise that I will Cherish
every moment with you,

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:55.466
today, tomorrow,
and the Christmas season
three years from now.

01:32:55.468 --> 01:32:57.601
That's very specific.

01:32:57.603 --> 01:32:59.402
And for all time.

01:32:59.404 --> 01:33:01.603
And I will never
take you for granted.

01:33:04.073 --> 01:33:06.707
I vow to be your
official taste tester.

01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:11.177
In sickness and in health,

01:33:11.179 --> 01:33:12.978
till death do us part.

01:33:13.612 --> 01:33:15.446
And so,

01:33:15.448 --> 01:33:17.247
Jason Michael Stewart,

01:33:17.249 --> 01:33:20.316
do you take
Lindsay Anne Rogers
to be your wife?

01:33:21.418 --> 01:33:22.918
Yeah, I do.

01:33:42.603 --> 01:33:45.037
Thank you.

01:33:45.039 --> 01:33:46.638
Throw the bouquet!

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:49.640
Over here!

01:33:53.343 --> 01:33:55.010
Aww!

01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:10.124
Mrs. Jamison.

01:34:11.092 --> 01:34:12.292
Thank you.

01:34:12.294 --> 01:34:13.693
Thank you for coming.

01:34:15.228 --> 01:34:16.294
Grandpa.

01:34:17.095 --> 01:34:18.161
Sweetie.

01:34:19.863 --> 01:34:21.230
Look at you.

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:25.833
Sweetie.

01:34:31.806 --> 01:34:33.907
Congratulations!

01:34:43.282 --> 01:34:45.549
He definitely doesn't
kiss me like that.

01:34:45.551 --> 01:34:47.050
Me, neither.

01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:59.294
All right,
see you guys at ginos.
