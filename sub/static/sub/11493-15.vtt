00:14.283 --> 00:15.733

find you in here.

Okay...

00:20.122 --> 00:21.539
I'm awake.

00:21.541 --> 00:23.541
Now get dressed.

00:23.543 --> 00:24.959
All right.

00:24.961 --> 00:27.110
Um... before I go,

00:27.112 --> 00:29.914
I do have that
morning phenomenon

00:29.916 --> 00:31.582
that sometimes
happens to fellas.

00:31.584 --> 00:33.417
You know,
in the morning.

00:33.419 --> 00:36.119
I don't care about
your erection, okay?

00:36.121 --> 00:38.138
Okay, fine, fine.

00:38.140 --> 00:40.791
I just thought
that I would point it out

00:40.793 --> 00:42.459
since it is...

00:42.461 --> 00:44.795
you know, pointing out.

00:44.797 --> 00:46.630
Very impressive.

00:46.632 --> 00:49.967
Now, skedaddle before
Ava wakes up, okay?

00:49.969 --> 00:52.319
You know, at some point,
I'm going to have to meet her.

00:52.321 --> 00:54.939
At some point, yes,
but not today.

00:54.941 --> 00:57.474
Yeah, well, I kind of feel
like I already know her.

00:57.476 --> 00:59.109
I mean, I'm certainly familiar

00:59.111 --> 01:02.079

01:03.481 --> 01:05.165

01:11.340 --> 01:13.507

Isn't that kind of cliché?

01:13.509 --> 01:14.992
Oh, God. In!

01:16.878 --> 01:18.612
I want to snuggle.

01:18.614 --> 01:19.847
Good idea!

01:19.849 --> 01:21.882

01:21.884 --> 01:23.801
No, here.

01:24.669 --> 01:25.970
Here. Of course.

01:25.972 --> 01:28.171
Um, good.

01:28.173 --> 01:29.723

a super-duper snuggle.

would be if we wanted

it would be cool if
we were brothers,

Uh... uh, dare I ask?

Uh, yeah, I was hiding
from Zoey's daughter.

04:03.917 --> 04:05.559

to meet her?

04:05.584 --> 04:06.784

for single moms

04:08.505 --> 04:09.787
to be protective of their kids.

04:09.789 --> 04:11.739
And then, when you are
introduced to them,

04:11.741 --> 04:14.292
you're "Uncle Alan, who's on
his way back to Cleveland,

04:14.294 --> 04:16.094
"and you don't have
to remember his name

04:16.096 --> 04:18.829
because you'll never,
ever see him again."

04:18.832 --> 04:22.300
What do you do to women
to piss them off so much?

04:26.505 --> 04:27.772

04:35.698 --> 04:37.482

in a relationship

04:37.484 --> 04:39.433
where you're really
into each other,

04:39.435 --> 04:41.402

isn't everything it could be?

04:41.404 --> 04:42.704
Oh, sure.

04:42.706 --> 04:46.107
Uh, except for the
"really into each other" part.

04:46.109 --> 04:47.909
It's not that the sex is bad,
Mm-hmm.

04:47.911 --> 04:49.277
it's just that...

04:49.279 --> 04:51.913
lately, it seems like she
could just take it or leave it.

04:51.915 --> 04:53.715
Oh... "Take it or leave it."

04:53.717 --> 04:55.800
Boy, I know that song.

04:55.802 --> 04:57.335
But my philosophy is,

04:57.337 --> 05:00.171
as long as she's taking it,
I'm not leaving.

05:00.173 --> 05:02.840
You know what she said to me
last night, after we had sex?

05:02.842 --> 05:04.008
(British accent):
"That was nice.

05:04.010 --> 05:05.727
Now let's do something fun."

05:07.296 --> 05:09.063
Well, I suppose
that's better than,

05:09.065 --> 05:12.967
"Put your pants on so we can get
back to the family reunion."

05:12.969 --> 05:14.736
You're kidding, right?

05:14.738 --> 05:18.189
Oh, she was just
a cousin by marriage.

05:18.191 --> 05:21.276
So have you actually talked
to Zoey about your problem?

05:21.278 --> 05:23.528
No. I was just hoping
it would just get better.

05:23.530 --> 05:25.446
Oh, no, no, no. Take it from me.

05:25.448 --> 05:27.248
There are two things
in long-term relationships

05:27.250 --> 05:28.833
that never get better
by themselves.

05:28.835 --> 05:30.168
One is sex.

05:30.170 --> 05:31.953
What's the other one?

05:31.955 --> 05:33.137
Does it matter?

05:37.126 --> 05:38.760
ZOEY:
It's all arranged.

05:38.762 --> 05:40.628
Ava's going to be
spending tonight with her dad.

05:40.630 --> 05:41.846

05:41.848 --> 05:43.331

05:43.333 --> 05:44.716

05:51.891 --> 05:54.058

05:54.060 --> 05:57.445

anything I can do

05:57.447 --> 06:00.865
to, you know,
make you happier...

06:00.867 --> 06:02.817

are you talking about?

06:02.819 --> 06:05.737

but notice...

06:05.739 --> 06:06.988
(chuckles)

06:06.990 --> 06:08.489
I can't even say it.

06:08.491 --> 06:09.841

06:09.843 --> 06:11.292
You can tell me anything.

06:11.294 --> 06:13.328
All right.

06:14.630 --> 06:15.964
The sex.

06:15.966 --> 06:18.049
You don't... you don't seem
to be enjoying the sex.

06:18.051 --> 06:19.300
Okay, I can't talk about that.

06:19.302 --> 06:21.669
Okay, y-you said we could talk
about anything.

06:21.671 --> 06:23.037
Yeah, but not about that.

06:23.039 --> 06:25.373
And certainly not on a computer.
(groans)

06:25.375 --> 06:26.874
Why? Nobody's listening.

06:29.878 --> 06:31.062
I'm sorry.

06:31.064 --> 06:34.048
I'm-I'm very uncomfortable
talking about...

06:34.050 --> 06:36.067
you know...
(shudders)

06:36.069 --> 06:37.385
No offense, but you don't seem

06:37.387 --> 06:39.053
that comfortable
doing it, either.

06:39.055 --> 06:40.989
You're still talking about it.

06:40.991 --> 06:42.440
I-I-I mean,
because if you're not,

06:42.442 --> 06:44.742
I mean, there are...
there are things that we can do.

06:44.744 --> 06:46.077
There are things we can try.

06:46.079 --> 06:47.829
Like?

06:47.831 --> 06:51.332
I don't know,
like role-playing.

06:51.334 --> 06:53.701
Role-playing?

06:53.703 --> 06:55.086
Yeah. You know...

06:55.088 --> 06:58.172
"Hey, lady,
I'm here to clean the pool."

06:59.041 --> 07:00.842
But I don't have a pool.

07:00.844 --> 07:02.510
No, it's an imaginary pool.

07:02.512 --> 07:05.630
How is you
cleaning an imaginary pool

07:05.632 --> 07:06.764
supposed to be erotic?

07:06.766 --> 07:08.716
Okay, okay,
just forget the pool.

07:08.718 --> 07:10.251
I... all I'm saying is-is that,

07:10.253 --> 07:13.938
if there's anything I can do,
just let me know.

07:13.940 --> 07:15.756
Thank you for your concern,

07:15.758 --> 07:18.426
but I'm perfectly
satisfied with our...

07:18.428 --> 07:21.195

07:22.064 --> 07:23.398
Really?

07:23.400 --> 07:24.782
Carnal interludes?

07:24.784 --> 07:26.534
Well, what do you
want me to call it?

07:26.536 --> 07:27.985
It doesn't matter.
I mean, the distance

07:27.987 --> 07:30.071
between "carnal interludes"
and what I would call it

07:30.073 --> 07:32.490
isn't really susceptible
to compromise.

07:32.492 --> 07:34.442
All right, listen,
I have to run and take Ava

07:34.444 --> 07:36.210
to her father's,
so I'll see you tonight, yes?

07:36.212 --> 07:37.545
Great.

07:37.547 --> 07:39.881

07:39.883 --> 07:42.800

Mary Poppins?

07:52.345 --> 07:53.627
Were you eavesdropping?

07:53.629 --> 07:54.846
If I don't eavesdrop,

07:54.848 --> 07:56.731
I've got nothing
to tweet about.

07:57.799 --> 07:59.400
The problem is she's English.

07:59.402 --> 08:01.652
Stiff upper lips and all that.

08:02.637 --> 08:05.306
You should date
a nice Polish girl.

08:05.308 --> 08:06.807
You don't say.

08:06.809 --> 08:07.975
Oh, yeah.

08:07.977 --> 08:10.728

they're all freaks.

08:12.331 --> 08:13.664

08:13.666 --> 08:16.084

in line and wait for.

08:18.787 --> 08:20.121
Good to know.

08:20.123 --> 08:21.339
I think I'll stick with Zoey.

08:21.341 --> 08:23.291
I just wish I could
get her to relax.

08:23.293 --> 08:24.292
You know, let go.

08:24.294 --> 08:26.544
Me, I'm just the opposite.

08:26.546 --> 08:28.963

leaning against the dryer

Listen, if you want to loosen up
the Duchess of Dull-In-Sack,

08:40.676 --> 08:44.345
you might try slipping her
one of my special brownies.

08:45.364 --> 08:47.732
I got a fresh batch
in the fridge.

08:47.734 --> 08:50.685
You know, for my glaucoma.

08:54.189 --> 08:55.706
Thank you, but I'm...

08:55.708 --> 08:58.659
I don't want to have to get Zoey
loaded to enjoy sex with me.

08:58.661 --> 09:01.028
Suit yourself.

09:01.030 --> 09:02.497
Doesn't want to get her loaded.

09:31.194 --> 09:32.910
you start
getting frisky.

09:33.745 --> 09:35.229
Frisky?

09:36.064 --> 09:37.415
Randy.

09:37.417 --> 09:38.899
Randy?

09:38.901 --> 09:40.418
All right. "Horny."

09:40.420 --> 09:42.687
(laughs)
Made you say it.

09:44.590 --> 09:47.425
Is that an invitation
to get frisky?

09:47.427 --> 09:49.076
If you want.

09:49.078 --> 09:50.428
If <i>you</i> want.

09:50.430 --> 09:52.763
Well, I want
if you want.

09:52.765 --> 09:54.215
No, no, I want
you to want

09:54.217 --> 09:55.766
because you want,
not because I want.

09:55.768 --> 09:57.251
Okay, I've lost
the thread.

09:57.253 --> 09:59.220
Now, are we gonna
do this or not?

09:59.222 --> 10:01.222
Only if you want.

10:01.224 --> 10:03.090
Oh, Walden, why are you
making this so difficult?

10:03.092 --> 10:06.260
Because I... it's not fun for
me unless you're having fun.

10:06.262 --> 10:07.445
All right.

10:07.447 --> 10:09.614
Let's have some fun.

10:10.732 --> 10:12.200
Oh, look.

10:12.202 --> 10:14.101
It's the pool cleaning man.

10:16.771 --> 10:19.624
Come to clean my pool,
have you?

10:20.492 --> 10:22.776
Okay, that's...
that's enough.

10:22.778 --> 10:26.631
My, what a big chlorine bottle
you've got.

10:26.633 --> 10:27.882
O-Okay, please stop.

10:27.884 --> 10:29.050
Let's just stop.

10:29.052 --> 10:30.418
You sure?

10:30.420 --> 10:31.619
Yes.

10:31.621 --> 10:33.120
Oh, okay.

10:33.122 --> 10:35.506
We'll go
to sleep, then.

10:42.247 --> 10:44.432
Do you like brownies?

10:44.434 --> 10:45.816
What?

10:45.818 --> 10:47.485
Is this another game?

10:47.487 --> 10:49.303
The sexy pastry chef.

10:49.305 --> 10:50.905
No. No.

10:50.907 --> 10:53.074
Come to butter
my baking pan, have you?

10:53.076 --> 10:54.325
(chuckling):
No. No.

10:54.327 --> 10:56.777
No. Uh... no.

10:56.779 --> 10:57.995
No.
Okay.

10:57.997 --> 10:59.313
It's just that...

10:59.315 --> 11:02.950
Berta made these...
pot brownies,

11:02.952 --> 11:06.120
and I just thought maybe,

11:06.122 --> 11:09.823
if we had one, that we
could relax a little bit.

11:09.825 --> 11:13.544
Oh... Tried that once
at university.

11:13.546 --> 11:15.463
Had a bit of a giggle.

11:15.465 --> 11:17.632
Is that a yes?

11:17.634 --> 11:19.951
I don't see any harm in it.

11:19.953 --> 11:22.603
What was that?

11:22.605 --> 11:24.438
Do you hear police sirens?

11:24.440 --> 11:26.307
I hear police sirens.

11:26.309 --> 11:28.776

European siren)

getting closer!

European siren)

11:45.878 --> 11:49.213

found the brownies.

Okay, she's definitely
not on the beach.

12:11.652 --> 12:13.885
Don't worry, man,
I'm sure she's somewhere.

12:13.887 --> 12:15.671
That's true.

12:15.673 --> 12:18.324
Everybody's somewhere.

Ah, thank you.

12:25.950 --> 12:28.250
Okay.

12:28.252 --> 12:31.086
We got to find Zoey before
something horrible happens.

12:31.088 --> 12:33.288
This is very good.

12:34.708 --> 12:37.209
Anyway, we should split up.

12:37.211 --> 12:39.578
A hundred bucks
to the man who finds her.

12:39.580 --> 12:41.079
Hundred bucks?

12:41.081 --> 12:42.631
We're in.

12:42.633 --> 12:45.134
Cool.

12:45.136 --> 12:48.220

Beats me.

but it's just hard for me

14:12.773 --> 14:15.841
to give myself to a man
unless I trust him completely.

14:15.843 --> 14:17.059
I certainly understand that.

14:17.061 --> 14:20.062

19:54.198 --> 19:55.614
What's happening?

19:55.616 --> 19:56.731
It's very,
very simple.

19:56.733 --> 19:58.567
I'm going to take
you into my bedroom

19:58.569 --> 20:00.852
and bang you like
a snare drum.

20:02.688 --> 20:04.072
WALDEN:
Yippee!

20:04.074 --> 20:05.907
♪ Men.

20:12.039 --> 20:13.372
♪ Men.

20:13.374 --> 20:14.390
Hey!

20:14.392 --> 20:15.725
Oh, hey.
Where you been?

20:15.727 --> 20:18.044
I went to the zoo with Zoey
and her little girl.

20:18.046 --> 20:19.896
Wow! So you finally
met the daughter.

20:19.898 --> 20:21.848
Yep.
Might make it tough

20:21.850 --> 20:23.149
if the relationship
doesn't work out.

20:23.151 --> 20:24.234
Why wouldn't it work out?

20:24.236 --> 20:25.818
Well, you know, the lack of

20:25.820 --> 20:27.320
sexual chemistry
you were talking about.

20:27.322 --> 20:29.689
Oh, no, we're way past that.

20:29.691 --> 20:32.442
Oh. So she opened up
about her trust issues?

20:32.444 --> 20:33.576
Trust issues?

20:33.578 --> 20:35.895
No, zoos make her horny.

20:37.731 --> 20:39.115
Really? You think that's it?

20:39.117 --> 20:40.583
Yep.

20:40.585 --> 20:43.503
Next weekend, we're going to
the San Diego Wild Animal Park.

20:47.258 --> 20:48.908
Uh...

20:48.910 --> 20:50.243
hello.

20:50.245 --> 20:51.744
(with accent):
You Walden?

20:51.746 --> 20:53.530
Yeah.

20:53.532 --> 20:55.748
I Zoey.

21:00.437 --> 21:02.388
Ah.

21:02.390 --> 21:04.607
It's nice
to meet you.

21:06.093 --> 21:07.610
Well?

21:07.612 --> 21:08.978
Keep looking.
