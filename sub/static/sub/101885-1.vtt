00:58.718 --> 01:04.423
<i>The first thing you need
to know about Rose is, uh...</i>

01:05.858 --> 01:07.827
<i>she ain't exactly human.</i>

01:12.999 --> 01:18.638
<i>Her parents were,
at least until the lights fell.</i>

01:24.677 --> 01:28.413
<i>From there,
it gets complicated.</i>

01:28.447 --> 01:29.614
Jarrod?

01:30.950 --> 01:33.552
<i>They harvested
her father's mind.</i>

01:35.420 --> 01:37.222
<i>They couldn't erase his will.</i>

01:39.926 --> 01:43.663
<i>He sacrificed his life
to save Rose.</i>

01:43.696 --> 01:45.497
<i>But there was another.</i>

01:45.530 --> 01:47.967
<i>A father
in search of his son...</i>

01:48.000 --> 01:51.536
<i>...took her in as his own.</i>

01:51.570 --> 01:56.909
<i>Something in that blue light
made little Rose grow fast.</i>

01:57.609 --> 01:58.811
<i>Too fast.</i>

01:58.845 --> 02:03.281
<i>Blood transfusions
helped slow it down.</i>

02:03.315 --> 02:05.617
<i>But that's not all
she inherited.</i>

02:09.689 --> 02:14.493
<i>Her powers freed every pilot
on Earth,</i>

02:14.526 --> 02:16.996
<i>reuniting families...</i>

02:17.830 --> 02:20.833
<i>and creating new ones.</i>

02:20.867 --> 02:26.038
<i>Over the next 10 years,
Rose and her brother turned the tide...</i>

02:26.072 --> 02:28.440
Ready?

02:28.473 --> 02:34.781
<i>...until the Harvesters unveiled
their ultimate weapon, the Armada Vessel.</i>

02:34.814 --> 02:41.486
<i>Said to harvest all life on
our planet with a single blast.</i>

02:48.027 --> 02:51.731
<i>We had one chance
left to stop it.</i>

02:51.764 --> 02:56.769
<i>The Red Fleet cleared a path
and Rose had her shot.</i>

03:00.006 --> 03:01.573
<i>But she froze.</i>

03:03.810 --> 03:05.343
<i>No one knows why.</i>

03:07.680 --> 03:12.450
<i>But it was just long enough
for everything to fall apart.</i>

03:14.754 --> 03:18.925
<i>One of our ships got caught
in the crossfire.</i>

03:20.993 --> 03:23.830
<i>To save all mankind,</i>

03:23.863 --> 03:29.601
<i>she had to kill
thousands of her own men.</i>

03:40.847 --> 03:45.117
The price of victory
was too much for her to bear.

03:46.719 --> 03:49.722
Rose turned her back
on it all.

03:51.023 --> 03:53.025
It's been five years.

03:54.694 --> 03:57.063
We haven't seen
the Harvesters since.

03:58.197 --> 04:01.499
What about Rose?
Where is she?

04:01.533 --> 04:03.703
Excuse me, love.

04:03.736 --> 04:05.671
I'm looking for Rose Corley.
Have you seen her?

04:06.706 --> 04:09.075
Popular question these days.

04:09.108 --> 04:13.578
Evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Sorry to break up story time.

04:13.612 --> 04:15.748
I'm looking for this lady,
Rose Corley.

04:17.950 --> 04:19.051
Have you seen her?

04:22.688 --> 04:24.991
Hiya, what's your name?

04:25.024 --> 04:26.591
- Kate.
- Hi, Kate.

04:27.693 --> 04:29.594
You haven't seen her around,
have you?

04:29.629 --> 04:32.430
She might look a little bit older.
Maybe a lot.

04:33.933 --> 04:36.702
- No, not lately...
- Not ever.

04:38.603 --> 04:40.505
I wasn't
talking to you, Popeye.

04:42.775 --> 04:44.810
So which is it,
not lately or not ever?

04:51.616 --> 04:53.719
You know, reward's up
to a million.

04:56.554 --> 04:58.724
More than enough to
get out of this shithole.

04:58.758 --> 05:01.027
Find yourself
a nice little gated complex.

05:03.829 --> 05:06.799
Just keep your eye open,
eh, old man?

05:14.240 --> 05:15.775
Asshole.

05:15.808 --> 05:18.978
Anyone seen Rose Corley,
this girl here?

05:20.846 --> 05:23.149
- Kev, have you checked these guys?
- On it.

05:27.219 --> 05:29.121
All right, mate.
I'm looking for this girl.

05:29.689 --> 05:30.690
No?

05:31.724 --> 05:32.825
Rose Corley?

05:33.993 --> 05:36.128
- Caught anything?
- No, nothing.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.812
I just need a refill, Doc.
Then I'm gone.

06:26.846 --> 06:30.582
Jesus, what the hell.
You couldn't have chosen a worse time.

06:33.085 --> 06:34.286
You owe me one.

06:36.989 --> 06:38.190
Get in here.

06:44.764 --> 06:47.033
You weren't kidding.

06:47.066 --> 06:48.600
Nasty bug
going around.

06:48.634 --> 06:50.803
Dublin's already
been quarantined.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.044
I know it's only a band-aid,
but the hyper-oxygenated blood seems

06:58.077 --> 07:00.880
to have slowed down
your cell replication.

07:00.913 --> 07:03.049
Except, this shit
keeps getting worse.

07:03.482 --> 07:06.752
Your firing hand.

07:06.786 --> 07:10.990
Concentrated exposure increases
the effects of ageing, I'm afraid.

07:11.023 --> 07:13.125
I can always replace it,
like Huana's.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.196
How is the old Chief
holding up?

07:17.229 --> 07:19.131
He's not doing
too well, either.

07:19.165 --> 07:21.867
His transplants got
infected by this new virus.

07:21.901 --> 07:25.671
Had to replace his leg again,
poor old bugger.

07:25.704 --> 07:27.973
Well, I'd like to keep
my cuticles if I can.

07:28.007 --> 07:30.042
Don't knock it till you try it,
young lady.

07:31.077 --> 07:32.211
Sure, Doc.

07:35.414 --> 07:36.916
Let me show you something.

07:37.950 --> 07:39.885
Ray, here,
was our first case.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.888
What are the symptoms?

07:42.922 --> 07:47.693
Thyroxine levels are way up. And the bodies
are eating themselves from the inside.

07:47.726 --> 07:51.964
I'm working on an anti-viral,
but it's unlike anything I've seen before.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.735
What you doing that for?
Where's the girl? Where is she?

07:56.769 --> 07:57.803
Backdoor.

07:59.939 --> 08:01.140
Relax!

08:06.278 --> 08:08.080
Come for your monthly
check-up?

08:10.916 --> 08:11.984
Stand down.

08:22.795 --> 08:23.796
Freeze!

08:34.039 --> 08:35.674
We gotta stop meeting
like this.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.447
Rose Corley...

08:41.480 --> 08:42.681
Ray, stop!

08:50.289 --> 08:51.357
Don't shoot!

08:55.127 --> 08:56.729
Rose Corley...

08:58.063 --> 09:00.399
you're under arrest.

09:00.432 --> 09:02.835
- Rose?
- Out the way, or I'll arrest you too.

09:02.868 --> 09:05.738
What charges? What the hell
is going on here?

09:05.771 --> 09:07.673
Whole city's under quarantine.

09:12.311 --> 09:15.347
<i>We have another
blue shell contained in the infirmary.</i>

09:15.381 --> 09:17.149
<i>We've locked down
the whole sector.</i>

09:33.766 --> 09:34.767
Did he find you?

09:36.101 --> 09:38.137
Your dad.

09:38.170 --> 09:41.373
- You don't think I know who Mark Corley is?
- You don't.

09:41.407 --> 09:45.077
Well, I know he's the famous
founder of the Resistance.

09:45.110 --> 09:50.115
And I know he'd probably still be
alive today... if you hadn't run away.

10:15.274 --> 10:16.275
Let's go.

10:26.051 --> 10:27.186
Welcome back.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.922
Home sweet home.

10:43.502 --> 10:46.238
Right here.

10:46.272 --> 10:50.943
Gotta hand it to you, Corporal.
Job well done. Drinks are on me.

10:50.976 --> 10:52.211
Don't forget your wallet
this time, huh?

10:52.244 --> 10:53.412
I never
forget anything.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.481
Except when
it's your turn to pay.

10:57.483 --> 10:59.852
- Careful.
- I don't take orders from you.

11:00.352 --> 11:01.487
And you are?

11:03.055 --> 11:05.291
Colonel Owens.

11:05.324 --> 11:08.494
But save your salute.
You don't have any rank here anymore.

11:12.398 --> 11:14.199
<i>You're our best
weapon, Rose.</i>

11:14.233 --> 11:18.937
Do you really think I would
let you just walk away?

11:19.605 --> 11:21.607
I thought the war was over.

11:21.641 --> 11:24.276
I won it for you at too high
of a price.

11:24.310 --> 11:28.447
There is only one thing
harder than winning a war.

11:36.588 --> 11:39.358
Keeping the peace.

11:39.391 --> 11:41.160
Wise beyond your years.

11:45.597 --> 11:47.066
You remember Violet.

11:48.167 --> 11:50.269
Yeah. 'Sup, Vi?

11:51.136 --> 11:52.304
Nice ink.

11:56.241 --> 12:01.246
This is approximately every
human being alive on Earth.

12:02.614 --> 12:05.150
And this is every freed Pilot.

12:05.184 --> 12:08.220
For the past five years we've
coexisted, more or less, peacefully.

12:08.987 --> 12:10.089
Until now.

12:11.090 --> 12:13.525
The Pilots are dying, Rose.

12:13.559 --> 12:17.329
What you saw today
is only the beginning.

12:17.363 --> 12:19.666
Soon they'll all revert
to their base biology,

12:19.699 --> 12:22.601
triggering a brutal hunt
for resources,

12:22.635 --> 12:27.539
which means they'll go back to
ripping our bloody brains out.

12:27.573 --> 12:29.375
How do you know that for sure?

12:29.408 --> 12:32.211
A few isolated cases
doesn't make a pandemic.

12:32.244 --> 12:35.547
We've already lost thousands
in Dublin.

12:35.581 --> 12:39.151
If we don't find a solution in the
next 72 hours, London will be next.

12:40.586 --> 12:44.156
However, we may have one.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.562
The Armada?

12:50.596 --> 12:54.466
Harvester ships have resilient core
drives which repair their tech.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.670
But every one of them we've converted
put together won't be able to stem

12:57.704 --> 13:01.507
the tide of three billion
Pilots. The Armadas can.

13:01.540 --> 13:07.446
Its core drive is powerful enough to
restore every Pilot on Earth for 100 years.

13:08.681 --> 13:11.250
But I destroyed it
five years ago.

13:12.251 --> 13:13.585
Take a closer look.

13:18.357 --> 13:23.996
Its core warped out.
Right before impact.

13:26.131 --> 13:28.000
And you know where it went?

13:28.033 --> 13:31.136
We cracked their entire
navigational database.

13:31.170 --> 13:33.272
All the way back to this world.

13:34.273 --> 13:37.242
We're calling it Cobalt One.

13:37.276 --> 13:40.612
Every question we've ever
asked... Where are they from?

13:40.647 --> 13:44.049
Who are they? What do
they really want?

13:44.082 --> 13:48.053
All the answers lie on
that shiny, blue rock.

13:49.188 --> 13:54.293
The only way that we can
defend our hard-fought peace,

13:54.326 --> 13:57.029
ensure a secure future
for all humanity,

13:57.062 --> 14:01.033
hybrid or otherwise,
is to get there.

14:02.669 --> 14:06.538
We're embarking on the first
manned mission to Cobalt One,

14:06.572 --> 14:10.609
and I want you to join us.

14:10.643 --> 14:13.780
I've assembled a team.
The very best our planet has to offer.

14:13.813 --> 14:16.683
You already know Leon.
Our hunter.

14:16.716 --> 14:19.786
As of now, he is your personal escort.

14:19.819 --> 14:22.187
Zhi, here, cracked
their navigation network.

14:22.221 --> 14:26.693
<i>Thanks to him, we can travel
five light years in a single day.</i>

14:26.726 --> 14:30.195
Colonel Owens. Former Navy Seals.
Sniper by trade.

14:30.229 --> 14:32.164
He can be a bit of a prick sometimes.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.335
But there isn't anyone I'd
rather have covering my six.

14:36.368 --> 14:37.603
Who's she?

14:37.637 --> 14:39.806
Alexi ran a counterstrike
unit in Eastern Europe,

14:39.839 --> 14:43.175
specializing in target tracking,
search and destroy.

14:43.208 --> 14:46.245
<i>She could find a needle
in the proverbial haystack.</i>

14:48.213 --> 14:51.651
And execute it with
extreme prejudice.

14:58.223 --> 15:00.492
So, what exactly
is my role in all this?

15:00.526 --> 15:02.795
We need your powers
to detach the core drive.

15:02.829 --> 15:05.832
Radford,
I've never done that before.

15:05.865 --> 15:08.200
Well, it's the first manned
mission to an alien planet.

15:08.233 --> 15:09.669
There's a lot of new
for everybody.

15:09.702 --> 15:11.771
But you'll have all the blood
transfusions you need

15:11.804 --> 15:13.673
to keep your powers
at full strength.

15:16.241 --> 15:17.644
What, are you keeping them
separate now?

15:17.677 --> 15:19.679
They seem
to prefer it this way.

15:21.213 --> 15:24.817
But we have found you
a roommate.

15:26.686 --> 15:27.687
Trent?

15:30.155 --> 15:31.523
I'll leave you to it.

15:35.494 --> 15:38.096
Nice to see you, too.

15:40.265 --> 15:42.401
Jesus. It smells like
a Pilot brothel in here.

15:44.136 --> 15:46.104
Yeah? Well, I haven't showered
in, like, a year.

15:46.138 --> 15:47.139
What's your excuse?

15:50.509 --> 15:51.510
What are you working on?

15:55.414 --> 15:56.415
Need a hand?

15:57.382 --> 15:58.383
I brought thumbs.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.722
You name it,
I've been there.

16:04.691 --> 16:06.759
Yeah, L.A. was all right,
I guess.

16:09.161 --> 16:10.329
Well, you could have come.

16:11.129 --> 16:13.231
Don't act like
you weren't invited.

16:16.234 --> 16:17.837
Reminded me of you and dad,
actually.

16:22.507 --> 16:24.376
Trent, I looked everywhere
for him, but I...

16:32.618 --> 16:35.220
I can't. It's my fault
he's missing.

16:37.724 --> 16:38.791
I can't just give up on him.

16:40.827 --> 16:42.327
You work for the people
who are hunting me.

16:42.361 --> 16:44.864
I can't just stop in
and say hi.

16:48.433 --> 16:51.269
Shit. I'm sorry.

16:51.303 --> 16:53.372
I can't even imagine
what this is all like for you.

16:58.243 --> 17:00.780
And you actually think Redford's
mission is going to work?

17:09.955 --> 17:12.223
It's not that
I don't wanna help...

17:16.560 --> 17:18.363
I don't know if I can anymore.

17:20.232 --> 17:23.970
Every time I use this...
I pay the price.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.238
Or worse,
someone else does.

17:27.539 --> 17:29.408
Maybe you're just
better off without me.

17:41.754 --> 17:43.488
Why are they always wet?

17:55.001 --> 17:59.404
<i>Rose, always knew.
It's Rose.</i>

17:59.438 --> 18:01.941
<i>'Cause I made a promise.
You know what that means?</i>

18:01.974 --> 18:07.345
That means, that no matter what happens,
I'm not going to let anything hurt you.

18:07.847 --> 18:09.214
Promise?

18:13.418 --> 18:16.421
Yeah, kid. I promise.

18:25.631 --> 18:27.365
Morning, sleeping beauty.

18:27.399 --> 18:30.368
- General wants to see you.
- Why? Wh... Where's Trent?

18:30.402 --> 18:31.938
He's with the others.
Waiting for you.

18:31.971 --> 18:33.773
Hmm.

18:33.806 --> 18:36.008
Let them. I gotta shower.

18:37.944 --> 18:40.046
- Leave.
- I'll be outside, then.

18:40.079 --> 18:41.379
Okay.

18:56.729 --> 18:59.598
So are you supposed
to just follow me around?

18:59.632 --> 19:01.934
That's what I volunteered for.

19:01.968 --> 19:04.469
Wow. Mom and dad
must be proud.

19:04.503 --> 19:06.538
Ah, can't all be as special
as you, can we?

19:10.810 --> 19:12.011
What happened
to all the Tankers?

19:12.044 --> 19:13.478
Need to conserve power.

19:13.512 --> 19:15.114
Can't afford to carry
all that extra weight.

19:15.148 --> 19:18.851
Still, you never know when a 40
foot tall bulldozer could come in handy.

19:18.885 --> 19:20.853
The General wants to
brief you on the bridge.

19:20.887 --> 19:23.622
Just keeps getting
better and better.

19:23.656 --> 19:27.425
For those of you haven't served with
her, or have been living under a rock,

19:27.459 --> 19:31.596
Rose, here, had been blessed with the
ability to interact with alien tech,

19:31.631 --> 19:33.666
counteract their programming.

19:33.699 --> 19:35.333
And having faced
the Armada already,

19:35.367 --> 19:37.770
she has an intimate
knowledge of our target.

19:37.804 --> 19:41.540
So, let's get her up to speed with the
mission as quickly as possible. Zhi?

19:41.573 --> 19:45.678
First things first. How many times have
you actually travelled by wormhole?

19:45.711 --> 19:48.714
Well, we've travelled
to the Moon. Mars...

19:48.748 --> 19:50.482
That's a walk in the park
compared to this.

19:50.515 --> 19:51.717
No one said
it would be easy, honey.

19:51.751 --> 19:52.885
Well, no one's talking
to you, honey.

19:53.653 --> 19:54.619
What about probes?

19:54.654 --> 19:56.255
Any successful unmanned
missions to Cobalt?

19:56.289 --> 19:59.091
No. We've sent them, but it'll be five
years before we receive a signal back...

19:59.125 --> 20:01.627
So, aside from our nav
holograms, we have no real intel

20:01.661 --> 20:03.328
what this planet's
actually like?

20:03.361 --> 20:06.666
As we exit the wormhole, we'll launch a
satellite probe and do a full planetary scan.

20:06.699 --> 20:09.068
Mmm. And what happens
when we run into Harvesters?

20:09.101 --> 20:10.535
We blend in.

20:10.569 --> 20:14.006
We change the ship back to its old
blue color. Along with our Pilots.

20:14.040 --> 20:17.944
Trent and Violet will pose as
a derelict ship returning home.

20:17.977 --> 20:21.379
Okay, relax.

20:21.413 --> 20:24.382
Once we touch down, your team
will infiltrate the Armada Vessel,

20:24.416 --> 20:28.486
under the radar, locate and
commandeer the core drive and then...

20:28.520 --> 20:30.089
get the hell out of dodge.

20:35.628 --> 20:36.629
That's it?

20:37.596 --> 20:38.597
That's all you got?

20:40.700 --> 20:42.969
- Oh, so you have half a plan.
- Yeah, at best.

20:44.837 --> 20:48.074
But it's a really
good half, though.

20:48.107 --> 20:51.143
We've simulated this mission,
roughly, 500 times with 90%...

20:51.177 --> 20:53.045
Simulations are nothing
compared to the real thing.

20:53.079 --> 20:54.113
That's why we need you.

20:54.146 --> 20:55.982
I can't take on
an entire planet.

20:56.015 --> 20:57.884
This is no war.
This is a heist.

20:57.917 --> 20:59.517
We're not going there
for any hero bullshit.

20:59.551 --> 21:01.754
Let them harvest another
10 planets, for all we care.

21:01.787 --> 21:04.190
We go there for one thing
and one thing only.

21:04.223 --> 21:06.826
- That drive.
- You're the only one who has the power to retrieve it.

21:06.859 --> 21:08.526
Enough.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.762
Colonel, give us the bridge.

21:09.795 --> 21:11.496
Sir. Let's go.

21:13.633 --> 21:16.168
There has to be
an easier way.

21:17.870 --> 21:18.871
Rose.

21:20.505 --> 21:22.875
You are the only way.

21:22.909 --> 21:29.115
I know this is far from ideal,
but we face extermination.

21:29.148 --> 21:31.150
We all have to push
beyond our limits.

21:35.021 --> 21:36.722
And what if I can't?

21:36.756 --> 21:40.525
You saved us all before.
And when the time comes,

21:40.558 --> 21:43.528
I know that you will
make us proud.

21:51.003 --> 21:52.204
When do you embark?

21:52.238 --> 21:54.073
As soon as you say yes.

21:56.909 --> 21:59.078
So what the hell
are we waiting for?

22:23.601 --> 22:25.938
Wormhole travel
is extremely dangerous.

22:25.972 --> 22:29.675
From the pressure, to the revolving
walls, its safest if you stay

22:29.709 --> 22:31.543
in here at the center
of the ship.

22:31.576 --> 22:32.812
Or what?

22:32.845 --> 22:36.849
Get too close to the outer
walls, you become part of them.

22:36.882 --> 22:38.751
Permanently.

22:42.788 --> 22:47.860
Doors open in 24 hours.
So, try to get some rest.

22:47.893 --> 22:53.799
And Rose, as long as we get the job
done, you and I will get along just fine.

23:38.344 --> 23:39.879
Oh, hell, no.

23:43.649 --> 23:45.184
Owens!

23:45.217 --> 23:47.053
Yeah, we're on lockdown for 24 hours,
so I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

23:47.086 --> 23:48.687
This is a huge mistake.

23:56.929 --> 24:00.066
- You all right?
- Mmm, no. No, not really.

24:00.099 --> 24:03.702
Yeah, well, this ain't exactly
my idea of a good time either.

24:03.736 --> 24:06.672
Wait... Were you
watching me change?

24:06.705 --> 24:09.175
What? No, I was having a piss.

24:10.409 --> 24:12.577
Yeah. Yep.

24:19.085 --> 24:21.854
Soldiers said to leave
before dark.

24:22.421 --> 24:25.057
Well, better get going.

24:25.091 --> 24:26.725
I'm not leaving without you.

24:28.928 --> 24:33.666
I've spent 10 years hiding
underground, living in shit.

24:33.699 --> 24:38.804
I'd just as soon see the end
up here, sun shining on my face.

24:40.306 --> 24:42.241
Thought I'd told you
to quit.

24:44.143 --> 24:46.412
Hey, Doc. They kick you
out as well?

24:46.445 --> 24:52.118
Managed to sneak Huana,
here, in past quarantine. Just.

24:52.151 --> 24:54.153
Why? Is he sick or something?

24:59.191 --> 25:00.926
Get him inside. Come on.

25:05.865 --> 25:07.733
So what's with
all the blood?

25:07.766 --> 25:10.202
Some kinda Dracula or...

25:10.236 --> 25:12.671
Oh, no, wait.
Vampires don't age.

25:12.705 --> 25:15.374
Whereas you're more of a...
Like a kid alien

25:15.407 --> 25:18.911
in Tom Hanks' body,
kinda deal, right?

25:18.944 --> 25:22.181
What, you've never seen <i>Big?</i>
It's a classic.

25:22.214 --> 25:25.718
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

25:25.751 --> 25:28.287
You don't remember what
it was like before they came?

25:28.320 --> 25:31.157
I was born
on a spaceship, genius.

25:31.190 --> 25:35.227
Oh, yeah. Right. Of course.

25:42.101 --> 25:45.337
How old were you
when they came?

25:45.604 --> 25:47.206
Um...

25:47.239 --> 25:49.108
I was in high school.

25:50.409 --> 25:55.114
The night before, my mum caught
me and my sister smoking a joint.

25:55.147 --> 25:57.082
Grounded us for life.

25:57.116 --> 26:00.319
I don't know how you all survived
that many years as teenagers.

26:00.352 --> 26:04.757
That was the one time in my life I
was glad I grew up freakishly fast.

26:09.828 --> 26:11.797
I'd give anything to go back.

26:14.233 --> 26:16.969
Never even saw my mum again.

26:17.002 --> 26:21.006
My sister, Izzy, and me,
we ended up in a train station.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.876
Worked our way to the
underground like most folks.

26:24.810 --> 26:25.945
Not much food.

26:25.978 --> 26:27.780
Even less info.

26:30.516 --> 26:32.751
I just remember the fear.

26:35.054 --> 26:36.388
Being scared.

26:38.791 --> 26:41.427
Thinking they'd
find us any day.

26:41.460 --> 26:44.897
Until my sister told me
about this strange

26:44.930 --> 26:46.899
little girl with
glowing red eyes.

26:46.932 --> 26:48.334
The one who could fight back.

26:54.139 --> 26:57.343
And your sister? Where's she?

26:59.044 --> 27:00.512
She's, uh...

27:03.449 --> 27:05.851
She was a bit
older than me,

27:05.884 --> 27:08.354
so, when the Resistance
started, she signed up.

27:10.122 --> 27:13.926
She wasn't anyone special.
Not like you.

27:16.862 --> 27:18.364
But she did her part.

27:21.066 --> 27:22.334
Paid the price.

27:27.840 --> 27:32.411
As far as I'm concerned, they don't
come any more special than that.

27:45.924 --> 27:48.861
How was the honeymoon suite?

27:48.894 --> 27:50.362
Hey, did you get any sleep?

27:50.396 --> 27:51.797
None at all.

28:01.206 --> 28:03.142
I thought you might
like to see this.

28:08.547 --> 28:10.416
We're just coming into orbit.

28:32.104 --> 28:37.042
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Cobalt One.

28:57.664 --> 29:00.933
Zhi, Alexi,
initiate the drone launch.

29:00.966 --> 29:02.334
Let's get some hard data
on this place.

29:02.368 --> 29:05.204
The rest of us
head for the subdeck.

29:05.237 --> 29:07.406
Pilots only on the bridge
from now on.

29:08.173 --> 29:09.241
Hey.

29:11.678 --> 29:13.979
Don't die, okay?

29:30.229 --> 29:33.031
You might wanna strap in.

29:34.032 --> 29:35.567
<i>Launching drone.</i>

29:53.986 --> 29:57.055
We've got incoming.

29:57.089 --> 30:00.392
- We're not picking anything up.
- Whatever it is, it's big and closing fast.

30:27.186 --> 30:29.421
- Status?
- Heavy damage to our central system.

30:29.455 --> 30:31.323
Trent, have you got
eyes on the ship?

30:31.356 --> 30:33.158
Is it pursuing us?

30:35.260 --> 30:37.095
What the hell is going on?

30:40.599 --> 30:43.435
Wait...
No one's driving the ship.

30:43.469 --> 30:44.737
It's just stuck in orbit.

31:10.462 --> 31:11.798
The core drive
is stalling out.

31:13.232 --> 31:14.233
We have to land.

31:17.469 --> 31:19.137
Focus, people.

31:32.150 --> 31:33.285
Brace for impact.

31:33.318 --> 31:34.586
Shit.

32:16.595 --> 32:17.830
Everyone all right?

32:17.864 --> 32:19.398
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:19.431 --> 32:20.633
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:35.882 --> 32:38.383
Core drive is dead on arrival.

32:38.417 --> 32:42.220
Backup generators will power
our comms for the next 24 hours.

32:42.889 --> 32:44.156
After that...

32:49.194 --> 32:50.596
Half a plan.

32:50.630 --> 32:51.731
At best.

32:51.764 --> 32:54.600
Only one way to get home now.
The Armada's core drive.

32:54.634 --> 32:55.868
Alexi, what's our position?

32:55.902 --> 32:59.338
Ten clicks from the Armada.
No signs of life yet.

32:59.371 --> 33:01.708
Surface gravity is slightly
heavier than Earth.

33:01.741 --> 33:05.344
Should take us six hours
round trip.

33:05.377 --> 33:08.180
- Get your team ready, Colonel.
- Yes, sir.

33:08.213 --> 33:09.481
Let's go. Come on!

33:10.783 --> 33:12.150
We're up.

33:26.933 --> 33:30.870
I've been working on a cure
since this bug showed up.

33:30.903 --> 33:35.440
I just need a little more
time to test my serum.

33:35.474 --> 33:37.476
So you can stop all of this?

33:38.610 --> 33:39.712
Perhaps.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.650
if I can save Huana,

33:43.683 --> 33:45.818
there's a possibility
I can save them all.

33:50.422 --> 33:52.290
They're attacking
the quarantine.

33:52.324 --> 33:53.893
We have less time
than I thought.

33:53.926 --> 33:55.662
How much more time
do you need?

33:55.695 --> 33:57.562
Hey, this is no place
for you, kid.

33:57.596 --> 33:59.498
I know you have weapons, Grant.

33:59.531 --> 34:00.767
Not enough for this.

34:00.800 --> 34:04.202
We're in the middle of the
largest Pilot Sprawl on Earth.

34:04.236 --> 34:05.504
There's no point in running.

34:09.976 --> 34:12.511
If you can hold them off
till morning...

34:14.279 --> 34:16.348
I might just have a shot.

34:19.518 --> 34:21.219
What weapons
are we talking about?

34:25.858 --> 34:27.827
Their bodies are armor-plated.

34:27.860 --> 34:29.527
Aim for the eyes.

34:29.561 --> 34:32.431
If they move, kill them.

34:38.437 --> 34:40.338
Are you guys serious
about these suits?

34:40.371 --> 34:42.909
Trust me.
You're gonna need it.

34:42.942 --> 34:45.577
Stab first.
Questions later.

34:45.610 --> 34:46.946
You got a license for those?

34:51.851 --> 34:53.552
Wait... Is this...

34:53.585 --> 34:55.554
Special mod. Custom made
by this big guy.

35:00.860 --> 35:02.494
Now you can fire on the go.

35:02.527 --> 35:04.596
All right, let's lock and load,
Alpha Team.

35:04.630 --> 35:05.865
It's going to be fine.

35:07.499 --> 35:08.533
It's go time.

35:09.367 --> 35:10.569
Yeehaw.

35:16.075 --> 35:18.310
Violet will remain here
and guard the bridge.

35:18.343 --> 35:21.513
Zhi and I will monitor
you all from the subdeck.

35:21.546 --> 35:24.349
Cobalt's atmosphere is roughly
analogous to their ships,

35:24.382 --> 35:26.919
meaning we can breathe here,
but it's low on O2,

35:26.953 --> 35:30.388
so you better pace yourselves.
But not too slow.

35:30.422 --> 35:31.958
If you're not back
in 12 hours,

35:31.991 --> 35:33.693
London will be wiped
off the map.

35:33.726 --> 35:35.494
So, no pressure.

35:37.830 --> 35:38.965
So...

35:40.700 --> 35:41.968
no pressure.

35:53.012 --> 35:54.847
Guess we're really
doing this, huh?

35:55.815 --> 35:57.817
Death or glory, Corporal.

35:59.518 --> 36:00.853
See you soon, Zhi.

36:08.728 --> 36:11.463
Please, I insist.

36:44.429 --> 36:45.564
All clear.

36:54.073 --> 36:56.142
<i>How's our signal, Zhi?</i>

36:56.175 --> 36:57.944
Loud and clear, Alpha Team.

37:00.046 --> 37:01.613
<i>Still no signs of life.</i>

37:01.647 --> 37:03.683
Music to my ears.

37:12.925 --> 37:14.359
Pretty trippy.

37:16.028 --> 37:17.930
But not entirely unpleasant.

37:17.964 --> 37:19.397
Keep the comms clear.

38:04.977 --> 38:06.045
What is it?

38:18.157 --> 38:20.026
Just a healthy
fear of the dark.

38:40.279 --> 38:42.982
How can this entire
place be empty?

38:43.015 --> 38:44.150
Maybe they left.

38:44.183 --> 38:46.018
Then why is
the Armada still here?

38:46.052 --> 38:47.920
Perhaps you damaged it
more than we thought?

38:47.954 --> 38:50.588
Well, if that's the case, then how
the hell are we supposed to get home?

38:50.622 --> 38:52.557
How many times
do I have to remind everyone?

38:52.590 --> 38:54.492
We're on a goddamn
stealth mission, here.

38:54.526 --> 38:56.095
So shut your...

39:05.237 --> 39:06.571
Free to engage?

39:10.608 --> 39:12.812
Anything moves...
burn it.

39:12.845 --> 39:14.780
So much for
your stealth mission.

39:21.153 --> 39:22.554
And what if...

39:23.990 --> 39:25.257
nothing's moving?

39:33.265 --> 39:34.900
No rush.

39:34.934 --> 39:36.102
Just the end of the world.

39:41.340 --> 39:43.175
Nav points to that cavern.

39:43.209 --> 39:44.910
Another three clicks
to the Armada.

39:45.711 --> 39:46.712
All right.

39:47.079 --> 39:48.147
Let's go.

39:49.348 --> 39:50.548
Watch your backs.

40:21.847 --> 40:22.882
How's our signal?

40:22.915 --> 40:25.251
<i>Owens, there's interference.</i>

40:26.786 --> 40:28.721
Damn.

41:03.089 --> 41:04.723
- Owens?
- Yeah?

41:04.757 --> 41:06.892
I think I know why
this place is empty.

41:11.097 --> 41:12.331
It's a tomb.

41:14.433 --> 41:15.634
Shit.

41:33.119 --> 41:35.387
I've got movement.
North wall. Two signatures.

41:35.421 --> 41:36.856
What?

41:36.889 --> 41:38.924
What are you talking about?

41:39.892 --> 41:41.193
Trent. Trent, no!

41:41.227 --> 41:42.928
Trent, wait!

41:42.962 --> 41:44.730
- Stay in formation!
- Where the hell is he going?

41:44.763 --> 41:47.199
- I don't know.
- Well, what did he just say to you?

41:47.233 --> 41:48.734
These aren't Harvesters.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.139
Two signatures. South wall!

41:58.444 --> 42:00.713
Whatever they are,
they're surrounding us.

42:02.715 --> 42:05.017
Zhi, talk to me?

42:05.050 --> 42:07.686
Zhi! Damn.

42:13.259 --> 42:14.693
Wait! You could hit Trent.

42:14.727 --> 42:16.228
He should've stayed
in formation, God damn it!

42:18.230 --> 42:19.298
Shit.

42:19.832 --> 42:20.833
Move!

42:21.767 --> 42:23.969
Christ's sake.

42:24.003 --> 42:25.771
I'm gonna
kill you, Trent.

42:45.424 --> 42:46.825
You hit something...

43:03.776 --> 43:04.877
What is it?

43:06.979 --> 43:08.080
I don't know.

43:15.854 --> 43:17.423
What's going on, guys?

43:27.499 --> 43:29.068
Some kind of camouflage.

43:36.141 --> 43:38.210
<i>Alexi?</i>

43:38.244 --> 43:39.345
Zhi?

43:40.412 --> 43:41.847
Go again, Zhi.

43:41.880 --> 43:42.948
<i>What's up?</i>

43:42.982 --> 43:44.483
- Zhi?
- It's gone.

43:45.251 --> 43:46.819
Where'd it go?

43:46.852 --> 43:48.354
What d'you mean
it's gone?

43:48.387 --> 43:50.322
It's still alive.

43:50.356 --> 43:51.490
Go back to backs.

43:51.991 --> 43:53.392
Stay in formation.

43:58.163 --> 43:59.231
We're cut off.

43:59.265 --> 44:00.799
No visual, no comm.

44:00.833 --> 44:01.767
What, everything?

44:01.800 --> 44:04.003
Did you hear that?

44:09.074 --> 44:11.010
Alexi!

44:14.146 --> 44:16.048
- Owens!
- Take the shot!

44:26.025 --> 44:27.226
I'm all right. I'm okay.

44:27.259 --> 44:28.394
Look out!

44:34.933 --> 44:36.302
What the...

44:37.870 --> 44:39.471
It can't see.

44:52.017 --> 44:54.420
You see that? D'you see
what they are now?

44:55.454 --> 44:56.455
Bloody shells.

44:59.892 --> 45:01.093
Rose!

45:02.227 --> 45:03.495
Incoming!

45:16.975 --> 45:18.410
Go get Rose! I'll cover you!

45:46.138 --> 45:47.139
Ha!

45:58.651 --> 46:01.120
Shit.

46:01.153 --> 46:03.956
Could use that gift
of yours right about now.

46:06.492 --> 46:08.327
Shit, something's wrong.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.663
Well, that's just terrific.

46:12.665 --> 46:15.067
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

46:31.283 --> 46:32.451
Alexi, wait!

46:49.702 --> 46:51.203
Alexi!

47:34.647 --> 47:36.448
Get up!

47:39.318 --> 47:42.421
Alexi! Hold on! Hold on!

47:42.454 --> 47:43.723
My leg...

47:44.724 --> 47:45.792
Okay, just breathe.

47:45.825 --> 47:48.728
- Son of a bitch.
- Come on. Trent will carry you.

47:48.761 --> 47:50.697
We're gonna pick you up, okay?

47:50.730 --> 47:52.531
Alexi, come on.
Now, you've got this.

47:53.666 --> 47:56.468
Tell Zhi I'll be
waiting for him.

47:57.603 --> 47:59.137
- Wha...
- We will.

47:59.171 --> 48:00.339
We gotta go.

48:00.372 --> 48:02.709
- No! Owens, we're not leaving her here.
- We gotta go.

48:02.742 --> 48:06.245
- We're not leaving her here.
- You don't get to make that decision.

48:07.847 --> 48:09.214
Please.

48:09.816 --> 48:11.083
Go.

48:21.493 --> 48:23.161
Alexi, I'm sorry.

48:23.195 --> 48:24.429
You're worth it.

48:26.733 --> 48:27.734
Go on.

48:28.835 --> 48:30.035
Go for it.

48:31.270 --> 48:32.371
Go!

48:32.404 --> 48:35.107
- Come on, Rose. Go! Let's move! Move it!
- Go!

48:39.311 --> 48:40.379
Move!

48:59.766 --> 49:01.466
Take cover!

49:03.602 --> 49:05.537
Something's happened to her.

49:07.539 --> 49:09.608
Well, we don't know what
it is yet. It could be anything.

49:11.276 --> 49:13.345
What about the drone?

49:13.378 --> 49:16.181
Uh, we lost our comm link
to it in the crash.

49:18.651 --> 49:22.321
But, I should be able
to reboot it from the launch bay.

49:22.354 --> 49:23.555
Well, get on it.

49:44.610 --> 49:46.713
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm okay.

49:46.746 --> 49:48.347
Thanks to you.
You good?

49:49.481 --> 49:52.517
Let's go.
Okay, come on.

49:56.188 --> 49:57.389
Care to explain yourselves?

49:57.422 --> 49:58.557
You wanna do this right now?

49:58.590 --> 50:00.325
I have one dead solider,

50:00.359 --> 50:02.929
a second who disobeyed
a direct order,

50:02.962 --> 50:07.934
and a third who's either unable or
unwilling to do her goddamn job.

50:10.335 --> 50:11.503
Hey, shut it shell!

50:11.536 --> 50:12.839
You're the one who ran off!

50:12.872 --> 50:14.339
Hey, he was trying
to protect us.

50:14.373 --> 50:15.908
Yeah, no thanks to you!

50:15.942 --> 50:19.244
You had one job
and once again you froze up.

50:19.277 --> 50:20.379
And a good soldier died.

50:22.347 --> 50:23.750
She doesn't know, does she?

50:27.519 --> 50:28.520
Know what?

50:34.226 --> 50:37.930
His sister was on that ship
you destroyed.

50:40.867 --> 50:42.835
Now I'm gonna
ask you this only once.

50:45.838 --> 50:49.174
Can you do your job or not?

50:57.884 --> 50:58.885
Shit.

51:02.889 --> 51:06.224
When was the last time you really used your powers?

51:06.258 --> 51:07.259
A month?

51:08.527 --> 51:09.528
A year?

51:12.364 --> 51:13.465
The Armada?

51:14.867 --> 51:17.770
Ever since we've been here,
things have just been off.

51:17.804 --> 51:19.304
Off? What do you mean off?

51:22.809 --> 51:26.913
- Christ. If you can't do this...
- I know what's at stake, Owens. Okay?

51:28.681 --> 51:30.482
And I'm not afraid
to die for it.

51:35.353 --> 51:36.354
This...

51:38.523 --> 51:39.624
gift...

51:41.426 --> 51:43.395
has been killing me
my whole life.

51:44.529 --> 51:46.398
Figured I got one last shot.

51:50.036 --> 51:51.536
So let's make it count.

53:02.108 --> 53:03.876
Elbows down and in.

53:11.651 --> 53:13.853
I was never much of
a fan of these, either.

53:15.121 --> 53:16.856
No choice without your cure.

53:17.757 --> 53:18.991
We'll see.

53:19.025 --> 53:20.760
I've injected half into Huana.

53:21.727 --> 53:23.395
Now all we can do is wait.

53:25.631 --> 53:26.632
You try.

53:47.687 --> 53:48.855
Grant!

53:50.522 --> 53:51.523
Grant!

53:57.562 --> 53:58.698
Get back!

53:59.799 --> 54:02.134
Hey! Over here!

54:02.869 --> 54:03.903
Eat this!

54:05.838 --> 54:07.572
Grant, no!

54:13.779 --> 54:15.614
Doc! Come and get it!

54:24.190 --> 54:26.591
Shit. I need a stronger dose.

54:33.866 --> 54:37.535
Grant! No, no, no.
Grant, Grant, Grant. Please, please.

54:43.643 --> 54:46.746
Sun's on my face, ain't it?

54:59.524 --> 55:00.993
Let him go.

55:04.997 --> 55:06.933
We have to move. Now.

55:08.566 --> 55:09.601
Get under.

55:19.679 --> 55:20.813
There she is.

55:21.781 --> 55:23.182
The Armada Vessel.

55:49.574 --> 55:50.810
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

55:51.911 --> 55:53.145
Just give me a minute.

55:55.781 --> 55:56.849
Cover her.

56:03.856 --> 56:04.890
What is it?

56:09.829 --> 56:10.863
Looks human.

56:13.165 --> 56:14.767
Maybe from one of our probes.

56:16.568 --> 56:17.837
Scan it back at the ship.

56:20.072 --> 56:22.808
- Leon, I... I... I can't.
- Just forget it. All right?

56:25.778 --> 56:26.779
I can't.

56:38.257 --> 56:42.094
Look, I wish I could explain
why it happened.

56:44.663 --> 56:45.664
But...

56:49.101 --> 56:50.602
I meant what I said
about your sister.

57:03.883 --> 57:04.917
Incoming!

57:15.694 --> 57:16.896
Shit.

57:22.334 --> 57:24.103
Run to that light shaft!

57:24.136 --> 57:25.171
- Run, run.
- Now, run!

57:31.110 --> 57:32.778
Get into the light.
Don't move.

57:32.812 --> 57:33.846
Trust me.

57:33.879 --> 57:34.914
Hurry, Trent!

57:43.189 --> 57:47.259
They can't see through the light...
I think.

57:48.227 --> 57:50.029
You think or you know?

57:50.062 --> 57:51.197
I think.

58:02.875 --> 58:06.145
It's working.
It's working.

58:19.325 --> 58:21.694
Son of a bitch.
It must be sundown.

58:22.394 --> 58:24.196
Well, that was short-lived.

58:29.802 --> 58:31.003
Lock and load, Corporal.

58:37.443 --> 58:39.879
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

58:47.987 --> 58:48.988
Our eye in the sky.

58:49.722 --> 58:52.992
Let's go!
Run for it! Let's go.

58:53.025 --> 58:54.293
What are those things?

58:54.927 --> 58:56.162
Pilots?

58:57.496 --> 58:59.198
Maybe a new species.

59:00.232 --> 59:02.001
A mutation.

59:05.804 --> 59:07.006
Wipe them out.

59:09.775 --> 59:11.076
That's for Alexi.

59:14.480 --> 59:15.714
Open the door.

59:17.383 --> 59:20.686
Go. Go. Go. Go!

59:21.086 --> 59:22.087
Go.

59:36.335 --> 59:37.336
Careful, Trent.

59:39.305 --> 59:42.341
Looks like nobody's home.

59:42.374 --> 59:47.379
If all the Pilots turned rabid, then
what the hell happened to the Harvesters?

59:47.413 --> 59:49.114
You think they got sick, too?

59:49.148 --> 59:50.216
This way. Let's go.

01:00:06.131 --> 01:00:07.166
There it is.

01:00:16.508 --> 01:00:18.010
Outstanding.

01:00:36.595 --> 01:00:37.796
You're up.

01:00:47.439 --> 01:00:48.874
Hey, big ugly.

01:00:50.009 --> 01:00:51.010
If I'm...

01:00:53.312 --> 01:00:56.882
If I'm gone,
promise me you'll finish this.

01:01:01.854 --> 01:01:02.855
No matter what.

01:02:20.099 --> 01:02:21.233
What the hell is going on?

01:02:29.709 --> 01:02:31.009
Rose?

01:02:32.077 --> 01:02:33.245
You all right?

01:03:06.345 --> 01:03:08.147
What the hell happened to her?

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:10.349
She went native.

01:03:41.046 --> 01:03:42.448
Doesn't matter.

01:03:42.481 --> 01:03:43.982
The core drive is down there.

01:03:47.553 --> 01:03:51.323
Relax, Trent. Finding the drive gives
us the best chance of finding Rose.

01:03:55.093 --> 01:03:57.996
And what if she tries to
stop us again, huh?

01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:00.132
You made a promise. Remember?

01:04:16.716 --> 01:04:17.717
Go get her.

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.167
They're off the grid.

01:05:10.737 --> 01:05:12.538
I knew we couldn't trust them.

01:05:12.571 --> 01:05:15.307
Well, we haven't exactly
been forthcoming, have we?

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:16.709
Stop. You're breaking my heart.

01:05:16.743 --> 01:05:20.412
I'm just saying this is their world.
Let them do the dirty work.

01:05:22.281 --> 01:05:24.784
No one's gonna get out
of this one clean, kid.

01:08:25.464 --> 01:08:26.598
<i>Rose.</i>

01:08:34.305 --> 01:08:35.307
<i>I promise.</i>

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.721
All this time.

01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:52.357
<i>All the doubt.</i>

01:08:54.426 --> 01:08:55.594
<i>All the fear.</i>

01:08:57.328 --> 01:08:58.563
It was you.

01:09:05.971 --> 01:09:07.874
You know what? You're right.

01:09:10.575 --> 01:09:12.011
I didn't come here
to destroy you.

01:09:13.712 --> 01:09:14.714
But I will.

01:09:21.453 --> 01:09:22.453
You okay?

01:09:24.055 --> 01:09:25.323
Let's go.

01:09:39.571 --> 01:09:40.572
Rose?

01:09:49.581 --> 01:09:51.751
Holy shit.

01:09:58.758 --> 01:10:00.059
How did you do that?

01:10:01.761 --> 01:10:03.428
I finally stopped
fighting my nature.

01:10:03.461 --> 01:10:06.398
But you're feeling
okay now, right?

01:10:06.431 --> 01:10:10.703
'Cause, you know, because, like,
I mean, y-y-you look, uh... great.

01:10:10.736 --> 01:10:11.771
Where's the core drive?

01:10:12.939 --> 01:10:14.073
It's right there.

01:10:17.143 --> 01:10:18.711
You hit like a girl.

01:10:21.881 --> 01:10:23.082
You did it.

01:10:23.115 --> 01:10:23.983
We did it.

01:10:24.016 --> 01:10:26.384
Save the group hug
for later. Let's go!

01:10:26.418 --> 01:10:27.653
Come on, move it.

01:10:39.031 --> 01:10:40.032
Cover us.

01:10:47.006 --> 01:10:48.473
Time to get your hands dirty.

01:10:50.142 --> 01:10:51.509
Payback's a bitch.

01:10:53.779 --> 01:10:54.780
Come on.

01:11:23.843 --> 01:11:25.477
Wrong choice, Corporal.

01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:32.051
Shit.

01:11:32.084 --> 01:11:33.585
Trent! Get down!

01:11:36.255 --> 01:11:37.123
<i>He blew the hatch!</i>

01:11:37.156 --> 01:11:39.457
Probably hostiles
at his back.

01:11:39.491 --> 01:11:40.558
And the others?

01:11:40.592 --> 01:11:42.962
Well, we can only
pray for them now.

01:11:42.995 --> 01:11:45.197
But thank God
he's got the core drive.

01:11:45.998 --> 01:11:47.565
Clear his path home.

01:12:03.249 --> 01:12:04.482
You knew...

01:12:52.865 --> 01:12:54.166
Rose, I'm sor...

01:13:00.006 --> 01:13:01.240
Don't even...

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:23.829
Grant's dead. Your serum is a bust.
And we're completely surrounded.

01:13:23.863 --> 01:13:25.965
What the hell
are we gonna do?

01:13:25.998 --> 01:13:27.967
We're gonna fight to the end.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.802
Just like Grant did.

01:13:29.835 --> 01:13:32.071
Now let's get to Huana
before they do.

01:13:38.844 --> 01:13:39.845
Wait.

01:13:40.713 --> 01:13:41.814
All right, go.

01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:47.219
- Hey, ladies. What are you up to?
- Shh.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:49.688
Quick!

01:14:10.643 --> 01:14:11.644
Go!

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:26.792
So the serum actually works?

01:14:26.826 --> 01:14:29.228
Trust me, I'm just as
surprised as you are.

01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:30.628
Cover the entrance.

01:14:31.964 --> 01:14:34.100
Get what we need.

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.068
This'll do.

01:14:37.369 --> 01:14:38.971
Get the hell out of here.

01:14:47.113 --> 01:14:50.316
No respect for science.

01:14:57.723 --> 01:14:58.924
How's he doing?

01:15:02.795 --> 01:15:04.797
You don't look so good
either, Rose.

01:15:06.899 --> 01:15:08.734
Please, just let me help you.

01:15:09.768 --> 01:15:11.003
I know you need it.

01:15:21.247 --> 01:15:22.281
And Trent?

01:15:23.415 --> 01:15:26.152
What did he inject him with?

01:15:26.185 --> 01:15:30.389
All I know is that
they want that core drive.

01:15:31.524 --> 01:15:33.993
And they're gonna do everything
they can to get it.

01:15:34.026 --> 01:15:35.694
Why?

01:15:35.728 --> 01:15:37.129
And don't you bullshit me.

01:15:38.197 --> 01:15:42.234
It's some kind of weapon.

01:15:44.203 --> 01:15:47.139
Powerful enough to wipe every
Pilot off the face of the Earth.

01:15:53.045 --> 01:15:54.914
Then why are you helping us?

01:15:58.350 --> 01:16:00.085
'Cause, I knew...

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:06.058
I knew deep down...
why you froze up.

01:16:07.126 --> 01:16:09.762
Why my sister died that day.

01:16:09.795 --> 01:16:14.033
I knew that you couldn't destroy
them because they're a part of you.

01:16:15.968 --> 01:16:17.803
And I hated you for that.

01:16:19.838 --> 01:16:23.475
But that feeling, that feeling's
simple, it's... It's easy.

01:16:23.509 --> 01:16:25.211
And now that I know
who you really are...

01:16:27.279 --> 01:16:29.481
Now it's complicated.

01:16:32.017 --> 01:16:33.118
Yes.

01:16:36.355 --> 01:16:37.890
Yes, it is.

01:16:46.799 --> 01:16:49.368
If we don't get to the ship before
Owens, we're gonna be stranded here.

01:16:50.536 --> 01:16:52.104
Yeah, what d'you want me
to do? Fly?

01:16:52.137 --> 01:16:53.172
Oh, can you?

01:16:53.205 --> 01:16:54.406
I'm serious, Rose.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.108
We've gotta pick up the pace,
otherwise we're gonna be...

01:16:56.141 --> 01:16:58.043
Wait. You see that?

01:16:59.878 --> 01:17:01.513
That's the same
as our ships.

01:17:02.915 --> 01:17:04.383
Don't move.

01:17:04.416 --> 01:17:06.919
We'll just...
Just wait here for you.

01:17:06.952 --> 01:17:11.090
You know, that sister of yours really
needs to work on her communication skills.

01:17:11.123 --> 01:17:12.258
You're killing me.

01:17:14.059 --> 01:17:15.527
Shit.

01:17:16.428 --> 01:17:18.030
Rose, we've got company!

01:17:21.867 --> 01:17:23.269
Shit...

01:17:34.113 --> 01:17:35.447
I guess this is it, then.

01:17:40.986 --> 01:17:44.523
Hey, come on!
Come back over here! Over here!

01:18:12.418 --> 01:18:13.419
Attagirl.

01:18:32.004 --> 01:18:33.405
Not bad for a human.

01:18:33.439 --> 01:18:36.075
Oh, finally she's impressed.

01:18:37.042 --> 01:18:38.410
Got one in my size?

01:18:41.046 --> 01:18:43.148
No...

01:18:53.425 --> 01:18:55.160
Hold tight in there, Trent.

01:18:57.196 --> 01:18:59.064
- What about me?
- I'm coming.

01:19:00.265 --> 01:19:01.900
This shit's exhausting.

01:19:01.934 --> 01:19:03.969
That's exhausting?
What, d'you wanna swap places?

01:19:04.002 --> 01:19:05.371
Hmm. Cheeky.

01:19:08.941 --> 01:19:13.145
Whoa! Wow. Okay.

01:19:13.178 --> 01:19:15.547
Whoo! Um, d'you want me to...

01:19:15.581 --> 01:19:17.416
Just hold on to something.

01:19:17.449 --> 01:19:18.984
Okay... Sorry...

01:19:19.017 --> 01:19:20.386
Not anything.

01:19:26.592 --> 01:19:28.994
You did good, soldier.

01:19:29.027 --> 01:19:32.531
Hell, you did the impossible.

01:19:39.004 --> 01:19:40.406
What about the others?

01:19:40.439 --> 01:19:41.273
Alexi?

01:19:41.306 --> 01:19:45.611
Zhi, make sure
this man gets some rest.

01:19:45.645 --> 01:19:47.546
I've got it from here.

01:19:52.251 --> 01:19:53.887
Does this thing go
any faster?

01:20:00.225 --> 01:20:01.326
Jesus.

01:20:05.364 --> 01:20:06.699
This wasn't a probe.

01:20:07.599 --> 01:20:08.967
This was a bomb.

01:20:14.373 --> 01:20:16.041
The shadow creatures...

01:20:17.644 --> 01:20:18.977
<i>Pilots back home.</i>

01:20:20.612 --> 01:20:21.681
<i>Trent.</i>

01:20:22.715 --> 01:20:24.249
It's all connected.

01:20:26.385 --> 01:20:28.153
They aren't just dying...

01:20:28.187 --> 01:20:30.122
Payback's a bitch!

01:20:30.155 --> 01:20:31.423
They've been poisoned.

01:20:34.092 --> 01:20:35.194
Radford.

01:20:37.062 --> 01:20:38.564
That son of a bitch.

01:20:40.332 --> 01:20:41.500
Let's go get him.

01:20:45.738 --> 01:20:47.372
Violet.

01:20:47.406 --> 01:20:48.775
We need to install this now.

01:20:53.345 --> 01:20:56.248
Just need to scan
for any contamination.

01:20:56.281 --> 01:20:58.116
I'm all right. I feel fine.

01:20:58.651 --> 01:21:00.185
It's protocol, Owens.

01:21:08.661 --> 01:21:11.063
Take us to firing altitude.

01:21:29.515 --> 01:21:30.516
We're too late.

01:21:33.519 --> 01:21:35.755
Let's give them a taste
of their own medicine.

01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:38.758
No.

01:21:39.792 --> 01:21:41.293
Not a harvest.

01:21:43.262 --> 01:21:44.797
An extermination.

01:21:59.779 --> 01:22:01.480
Well, it's been nice
knowing you, Rose.

01:22:08.855 --> 01:22:10.222
Brace yourself.

01:22:16.161 --> 01:22:17.563
Hold on!

01:22:33.445 --> 01:22:36.783
Now I am become death.

01:22:50.562 --> 01:22:52.197
Destroyer of worlds.

01:22:58.838 --> 01:23:00.372
Plot a course for home.

01:23:02.374 --> 01:23:05.243
Engage the drive as soon
as we're clear of the rings.

01:23:10.382 --> 01:23:11.416
Hold on!

01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:12.618
I'm holding on!

01:23:26.531 --> 01:23:29.936
Rose... we're in space.

01:23:29.969 --> 01:23:31.203
I know.

01:23:34.339 --> 01:23:35.374
There it is.

01:23:42.649 --> 01:23:43.816
What are you gonna do?

01:23:54.459 --> 01:23:56.161
It's working.
We're getting closer!

01:24:07.339 --> 01:24:08.473
What about Trent?

01:24:09.408 --> 01:24:10.609
How did he die?

01:24:13.813 --> 01:24:15.180
What's this about?

01:24:18.583 --> 01:24:21.654
Just trying to figure out why
there's traces of a high thyroxine

01:24:21.688 --> 01:24:23.422
pilot blood on your body.

01:24:23.455 --> 01:24:25.590
Same as on the diseased pilots
on Earth.

01:24:25.925 --> 01:24:28.560
Huh.

01:24:28.593 --> 01:24:32.665
If I didn't know any better, I'd think
they derived from the same source.

01:25:06.966 --> 01:25:08.533
Everything you've got.
This is it!

01:25:31.724 --> 01:25:33.760
Get us back
on this ship, Rose!

01:25:33.793 --> 01:25:34.794
Get us back!

01:26:08.527 --> 01:26:09.594
Motherfucker.

01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:12.732
Rose?

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:16.434
Get you to the med lab.
We've got some blood there.

01:26:31.516 --> 01:26:33.719
I really like what you've done
with your hair.

01:26:35.888 --> 01:26:39.025
Obviously, it wasn't supposed
to be like this.

01:26:39.058 --> 01:26:40.325
General!

01:26:40.893 --> 01:26:42.094
Zhi.

01:26:42.128 --> 01:26:44.831
Can't you see
they've been compromised?

01:26:44.864 --> 01:26:47.465
He's not the sharpest.
Just look at her.

01:26:47.499 --> 01:26:48.801
Don't listen to him, Zhi.

01:26:48.835 --> 01:26:50.837
He's been lying
from the beginning.

01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:53.371
He bombed Cobalt
before we got here.

01:26:53.405 --> 01:26:55.675
And then he unleashed the same
virus on the Pilots back home.

01:26:55.708 --> 01:26:56.843
<i>I know.</i>

01:26:56.876 --> 01:26:58.177
And I have the proof.

01:26:58.211 --> 01:27:00.646
<i>Shoot them and I send it to
every military base on Earth.</i>

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.414
Be my guest.

01:27:02.447 --> 01:27:05.151
Half of them will probably thank me.
Call me a hero.

01:27:05.184 --> 01:27:06.518
Or a piece of shit.

01:27:07.653 --> 01:27:09.789
Well, now, that's just rude.

01:27:10.622 --> 01:27:12.725
No!

01:27:16.195 --> 01:27:17.429
Damn it!

01:27:17.462 --> 01:27:19.165
You chose the wrong side, Rose.

01:27:19.198 --> 01:27:21.566
Of what? Genocide?

01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:26.772
The virus was meant to euthanize
the Pilots peacefully.

01:27:27.106 --> 01:27:28.908
Humanely.

01:27:28.941 --> 01:27:30.977
And you thought it worked, too.

01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:34.046
So you let it loose
in your own backyard.

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:37.482
But you had no goddamn clue what
you did until it was too late.

01:27:37.515 --> 01:27:39.952
Well, thanks to you,
I can mop up that error,

01:27:39.986 --> 01:27:43.421
eradicate every last one
of them, and save London.

01:27:43.455 --> 01:27:46.659
All in time for tea.

01:27:48.861 --> 01:27:51.163
Now I can give the Earth
back to mankind.

01:27:51.998 --> 01:27:53.900
The real mankind.

01:27:54.901 --> 01:27:56.168
You know what?

01:27:57.937 --> 01:27:59.171
You're gonna have to
fight for it.

01:28:37.777 --> 01:28:39.946
What's the matter, General?

01:28:39.979 --> 01:28:41.647
Afraid to fight for yourself?

01:28:44.516 --> 01:28:46.618
Not if I don't have to.

01:28:56.528 --> 01:28:58.563
- Head for the main road?
- Brace yourself.

01:28:59.732 --> 01:29:01.067
We're not in Kansas anymore.

01:29:47.579 --> 01:29:48.647
Trent, no!

01:29:49.181 --> 01:29:50.750
Trent! Stop.

01:29:55.187 --> 01:29:56.188
Fight it.

01:29:57.156 --> 01:29:58.290
Stop.

01:29:59.725 --> 01:30:01.093
Come back to me.

01:30:21.147 --> 01:30:24.216
You can't fight
their nature, Rose.

01:30:26.085 --> 01:30:28.754
That was never Trent.

01:30:30.022 --> 01:30:33.659
Or Violet.

01:30:33.692 --> 01:30:35.593
They're abominations!

01:30:35.627 --> 01:30:38.831
Something your father and I
could never agree on.

01:30:38.864 --> 01:30:40.166
So he had to go.

01:30:44.136 --> 01:30:45.204
As do you.

01:30:47.273 --> 01:30:49.607
You cheap bastard.

01:30:49.642 --> 01:30:51.609
Time to pay, Corporal.

01:31:00.052 --> 01:31:03.222
Get the fuck out of my way.

01:31:26.011 --> 01:31:27.379
I can't let her
leave this room.

01:31:29.248 --> 01:31:30.282
Go! Now!

01:31:35.454 --> 01:31:36.655
Open!

01:31:40.159 --> 01:31:41.393
Rose!

01:31:41.427 --> 01:31:42.962
Go!

01:31:42.995 --> 01:31:44.196
Violet!

01:31:44.230 --> 01:31:46.765
Open the goddamn door!
That's an order!

01:31:46.799 --> 01:31:47.900
Open!

01:31:49.201 --> 01:31:50.236
Violet!

01:31:57.042 --> 01:31:59.078
- We've got to go, Rose. Come on.
- No!

01:31:59.111 --> 01:32:02.014
If she gets to the core drive,
she'll kill everyone on Earth.

01:32:02.047 --> 01:32:03.048
Rose!

01:32:05.017 --> 01:32:06.852
Fine. If you're staying,
I'm staying.

01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:20.366
Violet's taking us
into the wormhole.

01:32:20.399 --> 01:32:23.068
Go get Trent
and get out of here. Now!

01:32:28.908 --> 01:32:30.176
What about you?

01:32:31.377 --> 01:32:33.812
I have to finish this myself.

01:32:57.770 --> 01:33:01.207
Easy, now, big guy. Easy.

01:33:02.208 --> 01:33:03.909
Trent, wait! It's not you.

01:33:04.543 --> 01:33:05.844
No! No!

01:33:35.107 --> 01:33:37.276
Trent! You need to snap
out of this!

01:33:49.955 --> 01:33:51.490
Trent! I know you're in there!

01:34:11.610 --> 01:34:14.213
Come on, get your
shit together, mate!

01:34:23.355 --> 01:34:25.090
Trent! Trent!

01:34:29.094 --> 01:34:30.129
Hold on!

01:35:15.074 --> 01:35:16.241
Rose!

01:35:21.046 --> 01:35:22.047
Don't let go!

01:35:43.469 --> 01:35:44.470
No!

01:36:52.404 --> 01:36:53.439
Trent.

01:36:53.472 --> 01:36:55.708
Stay with me.

01:36:55.742 --> 01:37:00.479
You'll be okay.
You'll be okay.

01:37:15.027 --> 01:37:17.062
All right. Good as new.

01:37:45.658 --> 01:37:47.326
It sounds bad, but...

01:37:49.829 --> 01:37:52.097
I never really saw them
as human.

01:37:53.332 --> 01:37:54.399
Just the enemy.

01:37:55.702 --> 01:37:57.670
A reminder of everything
I've lost.

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.742
But now?

01:38:02.775 --> 01:38:07.446
Now all I see is a brother willing
to give his life for his sister...

01:38:10.817 --> 01:38:12.584
and a dickhead like me.

01:38:16.355 --> 01:38:18.390
Yeah, well,
I think he likes you.

01:38:19.558 --> 01:38:20.559
You reckon?

01:38:23.161 --> 01:38:24.697
You're still alive, aren't you?

01:38:27.566 --> 01:38:28.567
Good point.

01:39:19.484 --> 01:39:21.587
- How far are we from London?
- Violet?

01:39:23.155 --> 01:39:24.590
Let's get there
as fast as we can.

01:39:42.574 --> 01:39:44.543
- It's too late.
- What are we gonna do now?

01:39:44.576 --> 01:39:46.378
How are we supposed
to stop them all?

01:39:49.581 --> 01:39:50.817
Leave that to me.

01:40:44.603 --> 01:40:46.873
- How the hell did you to that?
- Which part?

01:40:46.906 --> 01:40:47.974
All of it.

01:40:48.007 --> 01:40:50.677
Let's just say,
between your serum and my ship,

01:40:50.710 --> 01:40:53.278
we have more than enough power
now to cure everyone.

01:40:53.311 --> 01:40:54.847
Well, I guess
we're finally even.

01:40:54.881 --> 01:40:56.214
I guess we are.

01:41:12.732 --> 01:41:15.333
Look at you, all grown up.

01:41:15.802 --> 01:41:17.804
Wait.

01:41:19.504 --> 01:41:20.673
Where's Grant?

01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:26.244
Wish he could have been here
to see this.

01:41:26.278 --> 01:41:28.447
The stories he'd have told.

01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:32.284
I guess now it's your turn.

01:41:33.019 --> 01:41:35.253
Come on. I'm double-parked.

01:41:54.674 --> 01:41:55.540
Guys.

01:41:55.574 --> 01:41:57.176
Doc says it's gonna take
a couple of weeks

01:41:57.210 --> 01:42:02.782
to get used to the new body, but introducing
the new and improved Trent Corley.

01:42:05.685 --> 01:42:08.320
Nah, you look good, man.
You look great.

01:42:09.521 --> 01:42:10.723
How'd you get uglier?

01:42:14.392 --> 01:42:15.393
Hey, guys.

01:42:15.928 --> 01:42:17.395
Have a look at this.

01:42:18.597 --> 01:42:20.867
I hacked Radford's
personal files.

01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:22.034
What is it?

01:42:22.068 --> 01:42:23.035
A prison.

01:42:23.069 --> 01:42:25.537
Where he kept
all his enemies of the state.

01:42:30.042 --> 01:42:31.510
Including your father.

01:42:37.683 --> 01:42:40.019
Violet. Set a new course.

01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:42.554
I told you so.

01:42:59.906 --> 01:43:01.874
I'll go out again.

01:43:02.775 --> 01:43:03.843
Cut!

01:43:08.981 --> 01:43:12.785
Whoa. Oh, yes.
It's quite fun, actually.

01:43:15.755 --> 01:43:16.756
Watch your step.

01:43:26.699 --> 01:43:27.934
Cut!

01:43:30.102 --> 01:43:31.603
- Cut!
- Cha! Cha! Cha!

01:43:31.637 --> 01:43:34.006
I run fast, despite what they...

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:35.507
All right, I do!

01:43:37.777 --> 01:43:40.478
Got him!

01:43:42.715 --> 01:43:44.984
- Catch!
- Whoa!

01:43:57.096 --> 01:43:58.430
Fuck!

01:43:59.131 --> 01:44:01.433
Shit!

01:44:02.935 --> 01:44:05.137
Sorry!

01:44:10.609 --> 01:44:13.679
That's sweet.
It's just great that it's you.

01:44:20.119 --> 01:44:22.621
Check! Sorry!

01:44:22.655 --> 01:44:24.824
The leg fell off the table!

01:45:03.029 --> 01:45:05.965
No, come on!
Don't give up on me, Rose!

01:45:05.998 --> 01:45:08.234
Do not give up on me.
You got this. Come on.

01:45:08.267 --> 01:45:10.568
Come on, yes. Yes!
It's working...

01:45:10.602 --> 01:45:14.206
Fuck you, Liam.
What the fuck!

01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:15.841
Okay, cut.
Thank you.
