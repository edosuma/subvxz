WEBVTT

00:05.333 --> 00:07.582
Have you any idea
just how much shit

00:07.583 --> 00:09.332
your boy and his mates are in?

00:09.333 --> 00:11.166
Witness says
they were negotiating

00:11.167 --> 00:12.624
with a bunch of sheiks over
what looked like a gold bath.

00:12.625 --> 00:13.625
Gold bath.

00:13.626 --> 00:15.207
Spread the word, Hate 'Em.

00:15.208 --> 00:18.042
The Mad Hatter's Tea Party
will commence tomorrow.

00:19.458 --> 00:20.957
Vic Hill escaped.

00:20.958 --> 00:22.624
Took a guard hostage
and staged a riot.

00:22.625 --> 00:25.291
- When you'd two get out?
- About 37 minutes ago.

00:25.292 --> 00:26.666
What's gotten into you?

00:26.667 --> 00:28.082
He thinks you put
the moves on her.

00:28.083 --> 00:29.332
I am not putting
the moves on Chloe.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.666
Tread carefully.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.457
The posh one's got
a hard on for you.

00:32.458 --> 00:34.249
Of course I take you
seriously, Charlie.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.792
No, look, I... I mean...
that way.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:04.583 --> 02:05.999
You should be in prison

02:06.000 --> 02:07.416
finishing out
the rest of your sentence.

02:07.417 --> 02:09.249
What the hell have you
gone and done?

02:09.250 --> 02:11.249
I think I should be asking you
the very same question.

02:11.250 --> 02:13.374
My old lady
suppin' a glass of wine

02:13.375 --> 02:14.499
with my old mate.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.999
Very fucking cozy.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.499
Only Vic Hill could think
two friends

02:17.500 --> 02:19.041
having a meal together
needs more explaining

02:19.042 --> 02:20.707
than a bloody jailbreak.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.332
Well, the imagination
doesn't too many fences to leap

02:22.333 --> 02:24.457
before it runs wild,
if you know what I mean.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.499
Just take a breath, Vic.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.957
Lily was arrested last night,
and we thought it best

02:28.958 --> 02:31.332
that she didn't
go back home alone.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.999
Arrested? For what?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.582
It was nothing, you don't
need to worry about it.

02:34.583 --> 02:36.499
No, he needs to know, Lil.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.707
Bob Fink planted a shooter
at the house.

02:38.708 --> 02:41.457
Pinched her
on a false gun charge.

02:41.458 --> 02:43.541
Bob Fink?

02:43.542 --> 02:45.541
Why'd he come through the doors?

02:45.542 --> 02:47.041
I don't know, Vic.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.332
Maybe he thought I had
an ear on the gossip.

02:48.333 --> 02:49.582
This bullion robbery's
got everyone

02:49.583 --> 02:51.416
riled up all over again.

02:51.417 --> 02:55.083
And do you... have an ear
on the gossip, Lil?

02:57.875 --> 03:02.207
15 years later, and you're
still obsessed with the gold.

03:02.208 --> 03:04.000
You haven't even given me a hug.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.999
She's been through the wringer.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.458
She needs your support, mate.

03:22.333 --> 03:25.000
Am I to understand
that you're advising me...

03:26.208 --> 03:27.957
- how to talk to my wife?
- No.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.457
No, not at all, Vic.

03:30.458 --> 03:33.249
I'm just trying to keep
everybody happy.

03:33.250 --> 03:35.332
Then do just that, Norm.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.332
Keep me happy.

03:37.333 --> 03:38.666
Give me a clue.

03:38.667 --> 03:42.124
A whiff to sniff out my pile.

03:42.125 --> 03:46.166
You're chasing shadows, Vic.

03:46.167 --> 03:48.832
- Hate 'Em?
- Vic?

03:48.833 --> 03:50.582
Fancy a stroll?

03:50.583 --> 03:54.291
Nothing like an afternoon
walk to give one clarity.

03:54.292 --> 03:56.292
What do you say, Norman?

04:16.875 --> 04:19.166
That's a quality job
we did on that.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.749
See, this is not a question

04:20.750 --> 04:22.291
about quality, Uncle Dean.

04:22.292 --> 04:24.542
Yeah, more a question
of portability.

04:26.625 --> 04:29.124
You what?

04:29.125 --> 04:31.125
Move around-able-ness?

04:34.167 --> 04:37.666
See, a bath's a bit
difficult to move, innit?

04:37.667 --> 04:41.875
More, we...
gonna need it re-smelted.

04:44.042 --> 04:45.833
Re-smelted?

04:47.375 --> 04:49.375
The fu...

04:54.125 --> 04:57.499
We will do it.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.041
On one condition.

05:00.042 --> 05:02.832
All right.

05:02.833 --> 05:06.500
Who have I gotta
iron out this time?

05:07.792 --> 05:09.166
No, no! Hey, no!

05:09.167 --> 05:11.499
No, no!

05:11.500 --> 05:14.457
No fighting this time,
Billy son.

05:14.458 --> 05:15.582
Just a wee chat.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.917
A wee chat?

05:24.875 --> 05:27.916
Oi, come here. You all right?

05:27.917 --> 05:29.707
I got Norman's message.

05:29.708 --> 05:31.041
Told me Bob Fink
had arrested ya.

05:31.042 --> 05:32.541
Yeah, we've got

05:32.542 --> 05:34.499
bigger problems than Fink
right now, Albert.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.832
Go on.

05:36.833 --> 05:39.749
Your dad's out.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.499
He's out?
What do you mean he's out?

05:41.500 --> 05:43.582
As in out of prison.

05:43.583 --> 05:46.332
Bowling around
as free as a bird.

05:46.333 --> 05:50.999
Busted out with Hate 'Em All
this afternoon.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.291
He's broken out to get the gold.

05:53.292 --> 05:56.291
All roads leave to Rome.

05:56.292 --> 05:58.082
Selfish prick.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.332
We've gotta tell him
we've got it.

05:59.333 --> 06:00.832
No, no, you can't
do that, Albert.

06:00.833 --> 06:02.624
- Why?
- He's not thinking straight.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.332
He'll mess it all up, and
he'll take you down with him.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.457
What you gotta do

06:06.458 --> 06:08.499
is get him off the street,
just get him off the street.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.207
Yeah?

06:11.208 --> 06:14.457
Who's this?

06:14.458 --> 06:17.124
This is Chloe Koen, Mum,
my business associate.

06:17.125 --> 06:19.499
Hey, Mrs. Hill.
It's really nice to meet you.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.499
Since when did you have
a business associate?

06:21.500 --> 06:24.166
Chloe, fill her in. You be nice.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.832
I'm gonna go have
a look for him.

06:25.833 --> 06:28.208
There are only a couple
places that he could be.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.666
So tell me, Chloe...

06:32.667 --> 06:35.041
What exactly is your racket?

06:35.042 --> 06:38.666
Well, I... I'm not sure
what my racket is, Mrs. Hill.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.124
I've just been helping
Albert with some connections

06:41.125 --> 06:43.832
to help move...

06:43.833 --> 06:47.291
The... consignment.

06:47.292 --> 06:49.374
You're too pretty for a fence.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.582
I don't see myself as a fence.

06:51.583 --> 06:54.541
More of a facilitator.

06:54.542 --> 06:57.124
And are you
an effective facilitator?

06:57.125 --> 06:59.416
Heh!

06:59.417 --> 07:01.916
I'd say I was
a work in progress.

07:01.917 --> 07:05.166
And can you actually help
Albert move this consignment,

07:05.167 --> 07:06.666
or are you just
pissing in the wind

07:06.667 --> 07:08.832
like everybody else
in this neighborhood?

07:08.833 --> 07:11.124
I'm doing my best, Mrs. Hill.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.999
Well, I need you
to do better, Chloe.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.208
My family's in trouble.

07:23.833 --> 07:25.332
What are you doing here,
Master Charles?

07:25.333 --> 07:29.499
What are you doing here, Staff?

07:29.500 --> 07:31.541
I attend the manor house
once monthly

07:31.542 --> 07:33.582
to besom out the cobwebs.

07:33.583 --> 07:37.166
"Time will surrender dormant

07:37.167 --> 07:41.082
"so the rainbows of new eras
can emerge.

07:41.083 --> 07:44.167
Despite the hollowness of you."

07:45.833 --> 07:48.207
I think a hot bath
and a change of clothes for you.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.666
I can't have a bath,
my dear friend.

07:50.667 --> 07:54.666
The gold tub is gone.

07:54.667 --> 07:55.874
Long gone.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.707
Gold tub, Master Charles?

07:57.708 --> 08:01.332
It's presently being re-smelted

08:01.333 --> 08:06.832
into a giant, gold,
gleaming bust of Albert Hill

08:06.833 --> 08:11.541
by Uncle Dean and his clan
of gypsy artisans.

08:11.542 --> 08:13.207
What on earth
are you talking about?

08:13.208 --> 08:18.332
Shh. I speak secrets.

08:18.333 --> 08:21.749
To London, Staff.

08:21.750 --> 08:24.499
All this country air

08:24.500 --> 08:27.167
is starting to repair my lungs.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.500
Whoa!

08:37.875 --> 08:40.541
Christ's sake, Dwyer,
is nowhere sacred?

08:40.542 --> 08:42.124
Sorry, sir, it's Bob Fink.

08:42.125 --> 08:43.999
He's become
a full-blown liability.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.957
Shot up a carpark, killing
Father John in the process.

08:46.958 --> 08:48.666
Then takes it upon himself
to pinch Lily Hill

08:48.667 --> 08:50.166
on a trumped up gun charge.

08:50.167 --> 08:54.707
Look... If Fink wants
to piss the day away

08:54.708 --> 08:57.749
chasing B-listers, he can
arrest the family goldfish

08:57.750 --> 08:59.707
for all I care.

08:59.708 --> 09:02.708
He's up to something, sir.
I think that he's got a lead.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.832
You have an entire unit

09:07.833 --> 09:10.417
of the Flying Squad
at your disposal.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.124
Do you need a bigger strap-on

09:17.125 --> 09:20.541
to sort out one problematic
little officer?

09:20.542 --> 09:24.292
No, the strap-on I have
should suffice, sir.

09:28.333 --> 09:32.207
You need to focus your
attention on finding Vic Hill.

09:32.208 --> 09:33.999
If anyone can lead us
to the bullion

09:34.000 --> 09:38.625
and help crack this
investigation, it's him.

09:41.833 --> 09:43.833
Yes, sir.

09:45.375 --> 09:48.166
Hey, Nas, it's Chloe Koen here.

09:48.167 --> 09:50.416
I have a business proposition

09:50.417 --> 09:52.374
that I think
you'll be interested in.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.999
Give me a call back
when you get this message.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.625
Okay, speak soon. Kiss kiss.

10:09.083 --> 10:13.124
To the nearest
public house, Staff.

10:13.125 --> 10:14.416
Absolutely not.

10:14.417 --> 10:16.041
I'm taking you home to sober up.

10:16.042 --> 10:19.582
Well, that is not gonna happen.

10:19.583 --> 10:22.332
I'm gonna...

10:22.333 --> 10:27.124
What do you think you're doing?!

10:27.125 --> 10:28.957
Anon, Staff.

10:28.958 --> 10:32.166
Master Charles!
Get back here immediately!

10:32.167 --> 10:33.832
Master Charles!

10:33.833 --> 10:37.499
Here he is.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.292
Lady Carnation, Billy Ayers.

10:57.833 --> 11:01.875
Even more like him up close.

11:04.708 --> 11:06.499
What's this all about?

11:06.500 --> 11:07.832
This is the chat.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.667
I'll, I'll leave youse to it.

11:13.542 --> 11:16.874
I'm, sorry,

11:16.875 --> 11:20.791
but do I know you?

11:20.792 --> 11:22.792
You know of me.

11:28.292 --> 11:30.249
King Royston.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.416
As in my old man?

11:32.417 --> 11:34.124
Heh.

11:34.125 --> 11:35.832
What about him?

11:35.833 --> 11:38.041
I'm afraid I'm the one

11:38.042 --> 11:41.916
that had him done over, lad.

11:41.917 --> 11:46.042
As in... cut to ribbons.

11:48.167 --> 11:51.374
Well, good on you.

11:51.375 --> 11:53.750
I'm sure he had it coming.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.125
Billy! Wait!

12:13.000 --> 12:18.166
So... the truck barrels down
the frog 'n toad...

12:18.167 --> 12:20.582
Hits the spike strip...
Pop pop pop pop pop!

12:20.583 --> 12:24.125
Tires shredded like
cheddar stand at ease...

12:26.208 --> 12:29.624
I run up to the driver
all cock and bulls

12:29.625 --> 12:33.624
when he pulls out a heater.

12:33.625 --> 12:38.166
Sticks dos barrels
right in my boat race...

12:38.167 --> 12:40.249
But I was too quick for him.

12:40.250 --> 12:43.207
I smack the heater
out of his German bands,

12:43.208 --> 12:44.999
swing it around at him,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.542
and he pony traps
in his Alan Wickers.

12:51.458 --> 12:52.957
Look it up on YouTube, mate.

12:52.958 --> 12:57.832
It's all there
in full digital glory.

12:57.833 --> 13:00.082
Can I get a picture with you?

13:00.083 --> 13:03.166
I've never met a real life
gangster before.

13:03.167 --> 13:07.499
Well, now you have.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.999
It's all Dom Perignon

13:10.000 --> 13:12.250
and trips to Rio
from now on, darling.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.000
She's dying, you know.

13:27.167 --> 13:29.167
Shame.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.957
All she wants is a wee word.

13:35.958 --> 13:38.666
Talk about the old times.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.499
No, I know everything
I need to know.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.582
I'll tell the boys
to stop smelting then.

13:44.583 --> 13:47.166
Will I?

13:47.167 --> 13:49.167
Right.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.707
What do you think
she wants to talk about?

13:57.708 --> 13:59.832
How should I know?

13:59.833 --> 14:02.499
Gloat, probably.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.707
Listen, my parents,

14:04.708 --> 14:06.624
however you tell it,

14:06.625 --> 14:09.541
they come out
looking like tossers.

14:09.542 --> 14:12.124
A pair of irresponsible wankers.

14:12.125 --> 14:13.999
Random shag, baby on a doorstep,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.624
and a dead pikey, and she is
the one that offed him.

14:17.625 --> 14:22.499
That's a shit story.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.541
Want to know what I think?

14:24.542 --> 14:26.916
- Here we go.
- I think it suits you.

14:26.917 --> 14:29.624
Having a half-assed
idea of it all.

14:29.625 --> 14:31.332
Yeah, and how's that then?

14:31.333 --> 14:33.291
'Cause as long as you're not
tied to something solid,

14:33.292 --> 14:37.375
Billy Ayers, you can
walk away whenever you like.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.666
After you.

14:47.667 --> 14:51.791
I love what you've done
with the place, doll.

14:51.792 --> 14:53.499
You can move in if you like.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.207
Could do
with a hard man's touch.

14:55.208 --> 14:58.916
Be rude not to.

14:58.917 --> 15:01.166
Well, well, well.

15:01.167 --> 15:05.291
Look what the pussycat
dragged in.

15:05.292 --> 15:08.875
God. Not you again.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.374
Buckle up, Charlie.

15:19.375 --> 15:21.125
You're in for a rough ride.

15:39.833 --> 15:42.082
Very subtle.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.499
There he is.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.999
Albert, my son and heir!

15:47.000 --> 15:48.957
Father.

15:48.958 --> 15:50.749
You know, you're
a resourceful one, you know.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.291
How'd you find us, Albert?

15:52.292 --> 15:53.957
Call it an educated guess.

15:53.958 --> 15:56.249
He's half shot up
your boy, isn't he?

15:56.250 --> 15:58.332
Yeah, the apple does not fall

15:58.333 --> 15:59.957
far from the tree, Hate 'Em.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.749
Ain't that the truth.

16:01.750 --> 16:05.167
Come here, boy. Give me a hug.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.750
Come on, give me a hug.

16:13.500 --> 16:17.707
I feel the strain
of 15 years of loss

16:17.708 --> 16:20.249
in your embrace, boy.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.582
You're half cut.

16:21.583 --> 16:22.999
Well, that is incorrect,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.457
because I am intoxicated

16:25.458 --> 16:27.833
on possibility.

16:31.708 --> 16:33.332
Come here.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.541
Get on down here.
Come on, here, like that.

16:35.542 --> 16:38.541
Now you, come here.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.582
So what's the idea of you
busting out of prison?

16:40.583 --> 16:42.624
You know Mum's worried sick.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.124
Your Mum seems all right
to me, Albert.

16:44.125 --> 16:46.707
In fact, she is
positively made up.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.207
Yeah, well, why don't you
come back to Norman's

16:48.208 --> 16:49.666
and lay low for a little bit?

16:49.667 --> 16:51.166
Lay low? I think not, son.

16:51.167 --> 16:52.666
Myself and Hate 'Em,
we've got things to do.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.541
Is that not right,
my trusty steed?

16:54.542 --> 16:58.167
Right, yeah, our calendar's
are fully booked.

17:01.792 --> 17:04.499
- What things?
- You know.

17:04.500 --> 17:07.915
Pot of gold, end of
the rainbow and all that.

17:07.916 --> 17:11.374
You heard anything about those
chancers that boosted it?

17:11.375 --> 17:13.165
Yeah.

17:13.166 --> 17:16.915
You got your shell-like
close to the wire, right, boy?

17:16.916 --> 17:18.624
I don't know anything.

17:18.625 --> 17:21.290
Probably out of the country
and sold by now, innit?

17:21.291 --> 17:22.374
- No!
- No, I beg to differ.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.082
- No?
- Sold? No.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.708
I beg to differ,
you see, because...

17:27.333 --> 17:30.332
I can smell it. It's close by.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.207
Very close.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.667
Yeah, well, who knows?

17:35.792 --> 17:38.332
You do know you two stand out
like a pair of big bollocks

17:38.333 --> 17:40.457
on the back end
of a very small dog, don't ya?

17:40.458 --> 17:41.666
Why don't you do yourself
a favor

17:41.667 --> 17:43.582
and get your ass
over to Norman's

17:43.583 --> 17:45.124
and give Mum one less thing
to worry about?

17:45.125 --> 17:47.082
Don't make your mum's
worries your own, boy.

17:47.083 --> 17:49.666
You'll never grow up.

17:49.667 --> 17:52.457
Oi, Albert...
Albert, where you going?

17:52.458 --> 17:55.083
Stay, stay! We'll have a shandy.

18:05.042 --> 18:08.708
Flying Squad. Shit.

18:25.583 --> 18:27.291
Mum, I found him.

18:27.292 --> 18:29.832
Where is he? Is he okay?

18:29.833 --> 18:31.582
He's fine. He's at the Spieler.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.374
There's two... two unmarked
outside casing the joint.

18:33.375 --> 18:34.791
Looks like Heavy Mob.

18:34.792 --> 18:36.312
We've gotta get him
out of there now.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.957
- I hope you told him off...
- I did!

19:01.958 --> 19:03.874
Get a load of these two.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.499
I'd go with the one on the left.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.499
She'd eat you alive, mate.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.666
If I ever catch him
snorting bugle

19:08.667 --> 19:10.332
off that bird's tits again,

19:10.333 --> 19:12.499
I'd chop it off and put it

19:12.500 --> 19:14.583
in the mince, I shall.

19:18.583 --> 19:20.207
Dad, we gotta get you
out of here now.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.666
There's plainclothes outside.
You sure, son?

19:21.667 --> 19:23.124
Yes, I'm sure. Come on.

19:23.125 --> 19:25.125
I've got a van running
in the back alley.

19:29.250 --> 19:33.042
Wait for me, wait for me!
Hey, wait for... Oof!

19:37.833 --> 19:39.207
You two look
a little suspicious.

19:39.208 --> 19:40.832
Lurking around
like a couple of pedos.

19:40.833 --> 19:42.332
What you up to then?

19:42.333 --> 19:43.666
I'll tell you what
they're up to, Shell.

19:43.667 --> 19:47.707
They're waiting for us,
aren't you, boys?

19:47.708 --> 19:49.832
No, Dad, hold up.
Slow down, slow down.

19:49.833 --> 19:51.625
Slow down, slow down.

19:53.917 --> 19:56.249
Hey, hang on, oi!

19:56.250 --> 19:57.708
- No, no!
- No chance.

20:00.792 --> 20:02.792
Move.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.166
Vic, I think I've been stung.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.832
Me too.

20:14.833 --> 20:18.207
They've dirty, filthy
blow-piped us, Hate 'Em!

20:18.208 --> 20:20.041
They've done me again, Vic!

20:20.042 --> 20:23.666
- Hey!
- Dad, get in the van.

20:23.667 --> 20:26.999
Unh!

20:27.000 --> 20:30.416
Eddie?

20:30.417 --> 20:32.499
Albert?

20:32.500 --> 20:35.332
Sorry.

20:35.333 --> 20:36.957
Unh!

20:36.958 --> 20:39.916
He's touching me,
he's touching me!

20:39.917 --> 20:41.917
Hate 'Em?

20:46.875 --> 20:50.000
Albert? Wait for me!

20:51.833 --> 20:54.917
Vic! Vic! Vic!

20:56.333 --> 20:57.999
You are so naughty!

20:58.000 --> 21:00.250
Jonsey, Jonesy! Isn't that...

21:03.333 --> 21:04.874
Hate 'Em All Henry.

21:04.875 --> 21:07.166
Get off! Move, move!

21:07.167 --> 21:10.541
Vic!

21:10.542 --> 21:12.583
Wait for me.

21:17.958 --> 21:19.958
Too rough, mate!

21:23.375 --> 21:25.333
- Shit!
- Get back in the car.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.542
Fuck!

21:41.000 --> 21:45.457
So... this is what it's come to?

21:45.458 --> 21:47.999
Shot and tied up
by my own family.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.499
What do you expect?

21:49.500 --> 21:50.624
It's the only way we could
get you to listen.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.041
You listen to me, Albert.

21:52.042 --> 21:53.457
You unite right now,
or so help me God,

21:53.458 --> 21:54.749
I will tear you another asshole!

21:54.750 --> 21:57.124
For God's sake, shut up, Victor!

21:57.125 --> 22:00.582
Just shut up!

22:00.583 --> 22:02.707
Leave me alone with
your father, please, Albert.

22:02.708 --> 22:03.916
No, I'm staying here with you.

22:03.917 --> 22:06.541
I need to talk
to your dad alone.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.750
Go on.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.292
Let's hear it, Lily.
I'm all ears.

22:25.417 --> 22:28.457
All I've ever wanted...

22:28.458 --> 22:31.332
is to have you back home.

22:31.333 --> 22:34.666
Don't you understand?

22:34.667 --> 22:36.124
So untie me.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.124
Let me show you
what I can do for my family.

22:38.125 --> 22:40.499
You're bugger-all use to us
in prison, Vic.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.666
So I've been bugger-all
use for 15 years.

22:42.667 --> 22:45.999
- The penny drops.
- I have paid my price.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.332
It is time to collect.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.957
And what about the price
me and Albert have paid?

22:50.958 --> 22:53.249
What about all those years

22:53.250 --> 22:55.041
that boy never had a father?

22:55.042 --> 22:56.999
And I never had a husband?

22:57.000 --> 23:00.082
I'm very sorry about that, Lily.

23:00.083 --> 23:02.082
If you untie me,

23:02.083 --> 23:05.499
I promise you I will
make it up to both of you.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.666
What we are owed

23:07.667 --> 23:12.125
cannot be weighed in gold, Vic.

23:16.333 --> 23:19.332
Do not leave me
tied up in here, Lily Hill!

23:19.333 --> 23:22.499
You will stay in that chair

23:22.500 --> 23:24.582
until you grow a brain

23:24.583 --> 23:27.207
or a conscience, Victor Hill.

23:27.208 --> 23:29.082
I'd be happy with either.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.083
Lily.

23:33.292 --> 23:34.542
Lily!

23:35.833 --> 23:38.667
Lily!

23:43.375 --> 23:45.375
All right, then.

23:52.458 --> 23:55.666
Let's hear it.

23:55.667 --> 23:58.333
Expect you know
your mummy was a singer.

24:12.833 --> 24:15.541
Romeo and Juliet
it ain't, but...

24:15.542 --> 24:17.541
it has a certain class.

24:17.542 --> 24:21.041
Yeah, well, even a deadbeat
has his moments.

24:21.042 --> 24:24.041
Yes, you probably thought
she was a drunken slut

24:24.042 --> 24:27.499
and he was there
to nick the tour bus?

24:27.500 --> 24:30.332
Well, I may have started
rumors to that effect.

24:30.333 --> 24:34.957
Well, that doesn't
change anything, does it?

24:34.958 --> 24:37.292
He had his warnings.
He knew the stakes.

24:39.125 --> 24:42.125
Marriage promise was struck
when we were still kiddies.

24:46.167 --> 24:48.166
Ask you this, love.

24:48.167 --> 24:51.457
Why do you think he risked
it all that morning?

24:51.458 --> 24:53.624
You must have wondered.

24:53.625 --> 24:57.291
All he had to do was leave
your ma alone for five minutes,

24:57.292 --> 24:59.875
meet me at the altar,
he'd still be alive.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.458
It's okay. That's it, baby.

25:10.208 --> 25:12.874
Drunk, stubborn.

25:12.875 --> 25:16.207
How should I know?

25:16.208 --> 25:18.499
He sent me this.

25:18.500 --> 25:22.500
The night before...

25:25.458 --> 25:28.000
Poetic little bugger,
weren't he?

25:29.917 --> 25:33.541
"I'm sorry, but feck it,

25:33.542 --> 25:35.375
I love her."

25:38.708 --> 25:41.124
That doesn't help.

25:41.125 --> 25:44.624
And it doesn't change anything.

25:44.625 --> 25:48.375
Put down roots. Take a stand.

25:50.167 --> 25:54.083
Take it serious.

25:59.458 --> 26:03.332
All that fairytale bullshit.

26:03.333 --> 26:04.791
It's what got him killed.

26:04.792 --> 26:07.667
Aah!

26:16.958 --> 26:20.707
No. No, you daft twat!

26:20.708 --> 26:23.082
What killed him
was sending a sorry note

26:23.083 --> 26:24.583
to someone who couldn't read!

26:44.833 --> 26:46.833
You bastard!

26:59.750 --> 27:02.666
Well, I stayed here anywhere.

27:02.667 --> 27:04.832
And I tell you, Billy,
it's an easy life.

27:04.833 --> 27:08.332
Satellite telly,
BaByliss foot spa,

27:08.333 --> 27:10.707
and access to every
dreamboat in camp.

27:10.708 --> 27:14.374
But sometimes, Billy,
sometimes...

27:14.375 --> 27:17.166
The hardest thing
is the better thing, you know?

27:17.167 --> 27:19.667
I learned that the same time
as me ABCs.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.833
He made the right choice.

27:28.667 --> 27:31.124
I'm sorry
I buggered it up for him,

27:31.125 --> 27:33.500
and I wanted to say so before...

27:36.917 --> 27:38.583
I don't...

28:24.250 --> 28:27.749
Isn't this lovely, Charlie?

28:27.750 --> 28:29.832
Getting to know each other
a little better

28:29.833 --> 28:31.499
over a bit of raw fish.

28:31.500 --> 28:32.707
What the hell
do you want from me,

28:32.708 --> 28:34.666
you fuckin' lunatic?

28:34.667 --> 28:36.041
You know exactly what I want.

28:36.042 --> 28:37.666
But I'm done asking,

28:37.667 --> 28:40.041
so I'll just let you
volunteer the information

28:40.042 --> 28:41.332
in your own good time.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.999
You'll get nothing from me.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.874
Do you think
your friend Albert Hill

28:45.875 --> 28:47.957
would take the same
punishment for you?

28:47.958 --> 28:50.832
I do. Twice as much.

28:50.833 --> 28:53.957
Well, where is he, Charlie?

28:53.958 --> 28:55.791
You're the one tied up
on the floor

28:55.792 --> 28:57.999
like a beaten dog.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.374
You're the one about to get

28:59.375 --> 29:00.791
each and every one of your teeth

29:00.792 --> 29:04.082
kicked down your noble throat.

29:04.083 --> 29:08.624
And your best pal,
maybe your only pal,

29:08.625 --> 29:13.500
is nowhere to be seen.

29:15.208 --> 29:16.832
You might want to consider

29:16.833 --> 29:19.250
re-buttering your bread mate.

29:23.333 --> 29:25.333
Ahem.

29:28.542 --> 29:31.332
Fair warning, mate.

29:31.333 --> 29:33.916
Things are gonna get a lot worse

29:33.917 --> 29:36.416
before they get better.

29:36.417 --> 29:38.417
God.

29:43.208 --> 29:46.291
- We had him.
- Had?

29:46.292 --> 29:47.832
In the past tense,

29:47.833 --> 29:50.416
as in, "We no longer have him?"

29:50.417 --> 29:53.291
He slipped through the net, sir.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.457
Far be it from me

29:55.458 --> 29:57.874
to draw attention
to the self-evident,

29:57.875 --> 30:00.416
but in this age
of equal opportunities,

30:00.417 --> 30:03.832
I was so very much
looking forward

30:03.833 --> 30:06.332
to proving the naysayers
wrong in my...

30:06.333 --> 30:09.666
<i>recommending a woman</i>
to lead the Flying Squad.

30:09.667 --> 30:11.499
I was the best candidate
for the job.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.957
Well, that's
where we differ, Dwyer.

30:13.958 --> 30:15.916
I think the best candidate
for the job

30:15.917 --> 30:17.999
would be up to the task
of tracking

30:18.000 --> 30:20.832
a stick up artist long past
his sell-by date

30:20.833 --> 30:22.874
and his eight-foot
Neanderthal bushwhacker

30:22.875 --> 30:25.332
without allowing them...

30:25.333 --> 30:27.457
to slip through the net.

30:27.458 --> 30:28.957
I can explain, sir...

30:28.958 --> 30:31.167
One moment, please, Dwyer.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.957
If you don't lock down

30:48.958 --> 30:52.832
Vic Hill, Dwyer, I will.

30:52.833 --> 30:56.124
And then what use
would I have for you?

30:56.125 --> 30:58.125
On it, sir.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.500
Right.

31:27.708 --> 31:29.042
Vic.

31:31.458 --> 31:32.791
You okay?

31:32.792 --> 31:34.708
Having a ball,
thanks for asking.

31:39.833 --> 31:42.249
I feel for you, Vic. Truly.

31:42.250 --> 31:44.332
Heh.

31:44.333 --> 31:45.666
I can't imagine being away

31:45.667 --> 31:48.082
from a... beautiful family
like yours

31:48.083 --> 31:49.999
all those years.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.832
It would've tore me apart.

31:52.833 --> 31:56.042
Every second of every day.

32:11.333 --> 32:13.333
Here.

32:29.417 --> 32:32.333
How long have we known
each other, Norm?

32:33.500 --> 32:34.999
Wow. Heh!

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Must gotta be pushing
30 years now.

32:39.875 --> 32:42.708
We kicked in a few doors
back in the day, pal?

32:44.208 --> 32:46.708
More than doors, Vic.

32:49.333 --> 32:51.999
I've let you all down.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.167
I know that now.

32:56.292 --> 32:58.832
I want to make it right.

32:58.833 --> 33:01.166
For Lily.

33:01.167 --> 33:03.291
For Albert.

33:03.292 --> 33:05.332
For you, Norm.

33:05.333 --> 33:07.166
For me?

33:07.167 --> 33:09.457
Well, let's face it.

33:09.458 --> 33:13.332
Things haven't been easy for you

33:13.333 --> 33:15.166
these past 15 years either.

33:15.167 --> 33:18.124
Got left out on your ass
when I got nicked.

33:18.125 --> 33:20.874
I feel responsible for that.

33:20.875 --> 33:23.291
Well...

33:23.292 --> 33:25.875
Hasn't been easy.

33:28.250 --> 33:31.041
Cut me loose, old pal.

33:31.042 --> 33:34.166
Let me make things right.

33:34.167 --> 33:36.167
For all of us.

33:39.333 --> 33:41.666
Well, that gold is...

33:41.667 --> 33:45.124
as much mine as it is anybody's.

33:45.125 --> 33:46.957
Right, Vic?

33:46.958 --> 33:49.333
More than most, Norm.

34:19.375 --> 34:21.331
Be lucky, Vic.

34:21.333 --> 34:23.500
Luck's for losers, Norm.

34:50.500 --> 34:54.498
Listen, I... It's possible
that I've...

34:54.500 --> 34:56.750
been, like...

34:59.375 --> 35:03.874
Keeping you
at arm's length or whatever.

35:03.875 --> 35:06.166
For...

35:06.167 --> 35:09.999
For the wrong reasons.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.374
I'm so used to just...

35:14.375 --> 35:16.375
Move-about-able-ness?

35:19.375 --> 35:22.208
Move-about-able-ness.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.666
Then... maybe we should just

35:28.667 --> 35:31.832
stay put for a bit.

35:31.833 --> 35:34.207
See if it fits.

35:34.208 --> 35:36.874
Yeah.

35:36.875 --> 35:38.708
Yeah.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.875
Your owner's a bugger,
you know that?

36:09.708 --> 36:12.832
Scooter...

36:12.833 --> 36:14.666
I think it's possible
I may have cocked up

36:14.667 --> 36:17.333
in an unprecedented sort of way.

36:20.833 --> 36:25.124
Remind me to apologize
to Chloe and Albert.

36:25.125 --> 36:27.374
If I ever get out of here alive.

36:27.375 --> 36:29.999
Okay, Nas, that's great.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.291
Let me know
your travel arrangements

36:32.292 --> 36:34.957
and we'll work out
all the details.

36:34.958 --> 36:36.249
Okay.

36:36.250 --> 36:39.749
Bye.

36:39.750 --> 36:41.749
Yes!

36:41.750 --> 36:43.499
What are you all excited about?

36:43.500 --> 36:46.666
Nas Stone is coming
to London tomorrow morning.

36:46.667 --> 36:47.832
Is he really?

36:47.833 --> 36:49.374
And we're happy about this why?

36:49.375 --> 36:51.457
He wants the rest
of the gold, Albert.

36:51.458 --> 36:53.374
Like all of the rest of it.

36:53.375 --> 36:55.541
I have to be competitive
with the price.

36:55.542 --> 36:58.499
15% discount
for the bulk purchase.

36:58.500 --> 37:01.999
I hope that's okay, but he says
he'll take all of it.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.999
Yeah, no, that's more than okay.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.667
That is brilliant!

37:11.292 --> 37:12.582
Albert!

37:12.583 --> 37:15.124
Yeah? What's up?

37:15.125 --> 37:16.499
- He's gone.
- What do you mean he's gone?

37:16.500 --> 37:20.042
Your dad, he's gone!

37:31.208 --> 37:33.208
Oof! Unh!

37:38.083 --> 37:39.749
- Shit!
- Unh.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.333
You ever think to use
the zebra crossing?

37:47.333 --> 37:49.708
It might be beneficial
to your health, mate.

37:52.292 --> 37:54.957
Vi?

37:54.958 --> 37:57.957
Bob?

37:57.958 --> 37:59.749
I'll rip your head off!

37:59.750 --> 38:02.166
Put the brakes on, Vic.

38:02.167 --> 38:04.207
You wouldn't want to assault
an officer of the law

38:04.208 --> 38:06.374
on top of everything else
you're up against at the minute.

38:06.375 --> 38:08.249
You ain't the law, Bob.
You never were.

38:08.250 --> 38:11.917
Whether I am or ain't,
it suited you fine once.

38:14.375 --> 38:17.541
15 years I've wondered.

38:17.542 --> 38:21.249
Why? Why'd you do it, Bob?

38:21.250 --> 38:23.707
The gold.

38:23.708 --> 38:26.791
Decent cut earmarked for you.

38:26.792 --> 38:30.541
Why did you rip me off?!

38:30.542 --> 38:34.166
I could pretend it was
the promise of a bigger cut.

38:34.167 --> 38:36.624
I could pretend the badge
was still worth a toss

38:36.625 --> 38:40.124
back then, but you know
the truth, Vic?

38:40.125 --> 38:43.666
They took me out for a pint.

38:43.667 --> 38:46.082
Flying Squad detectives
and brass.

38:46.083 --> 38:49.291
They acted like I was crew.

38:49.292 --> 38:50.624
That simple.

38:50.625 --> 38:52.291
To to you lot,
I was only ever...

38:52.292 --> 38:56.582
Convenient grass.

38:56.583 --> 38:59.666
Why you hassling my family?

38:59.667 --> 39:01.916
Tracking Albert, arresting Lily.

39:01.917 --> 39:03.582
What do you want?

39:03.583 --> 39:05.499
You know what.

39:05.500 --> 39:08.041
Same thing as you.

39:08.042 --> 39:10.332
Nah.

39:10.333 --> 39:12.291
It's more than the gold
isn't it, Bob?

39:12.292 --> 39:15.957
Fact is, it ain't really
the gold you want at all, is it?

39:15.958 --> 39:18.999
Then you tell me, Vic.
What is it?

39:19.000 --> 39:22.666
What is it I want?

39:22.667 --> 39:25.832
Bragging rights.

39:25.833 --> 39:26.833
Pride.

39:28.958 --> 39:31.166
Suck some of that poison
inside of you.

39:31.167 --> 39:34.249
Show 'em all
who the smart one is, right?

39:34.250 --> 39:36.416
I see you.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.916
I put you...

39:38.917 --> 39:41.582
I put you onto the best scores
of your career.

39:41.583 --> 39:46.332
I made Vic Hill. Me!

39:46.333 --> 39:47.832
All you had to do

39:47.833 --> 39:51.707
was just show a little bit
of appreciation.

39:51.708 --> 39:53.791
Aww!

39:53.792 --> 39:56.457
The cold bloody fish
who just wanted a cuddle.

39:56.458 --> 39:58.291
You sold us to the Sweeney

39:58.292 --> 40:00.291
just because
they pretended to like you.

40:00.292 --> 40:01.832
First chance they got,

40:01.833 --> 40:03.166
they heaved you
out of the way and all.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.457
Do you know why,
do you know why?

40:04.458 --> 40:06.457
Enlighten me, Vic.

40:06.458 --> 40:08.124
Because you're a sinister
bollock, a fuck-up merchant

40:08.125 --> 40:09.916
that no one wants at the party.

40:09.917 --> 40:11.832
It's because
you cannot be trusted

40:11.833 --> 40:15.208
with big boys toys.

40:20.042 --> 40:23.582
You're right.

40:23.583 --> 40:26.874
I am a very sad man.

40:26.875 --> 40:32.041
I'm a very lonely man.

40:32.042 --> 40:34.041
Not like you.

40:34.042 --> 40:37.832
Surrounded by
your loving family.

40:37.833 --> 40:39.582
Where are they again?

40:39.583 --> 40:41.791
Some people
just don't appreciate

40:41.792 --> 40:42.999
what they've already got.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.291
They're too blind to see

40:44.292 --> 40:47.125
what's right under their noses.

40:49.375 --> 40:52.082
You know something.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.916
You've got a lead
on the metal, haven't ya?

40:54.917 --> 40:56.416
You've only gotta ask, Vic.

40:56.417 --> 40:57.957
I'll clue you in.
Level playing field.

40:57.958 --> 40:59.832
May the best man win
and all that.

40:59.833 --> 41:03.417
All you've gotta do
is say "please".

41:04.500 --> 41:05.874
Like, you said, pride.

41:05.875 --> 41:07.332
You rob me of mine.
I'll have yours instead.

41:07.333 --> 41:09.832
The gold is mine!

41:09.833 --> 41:12.499
And I will not have some slimy
little two-Bob shit nick it

41:12.500 --> 41:14.167
because nobody ever hugged him!

41:17.042 --> 41:19.957
You don't know, do ya?

41:19.958 --> 41:21.791
You have no clue.

41:21.792 --> 41:24.250
Know what?

41:31.292 --> 41:33.292
Bang.

41:39.292 --> 41:42.624
You hugged your boy lately, Vic?

41:42.625 --> 41:45.875
You think he trusts you
with the big-boy toys?

42:00.833 --> 42:02.333
Albert?
