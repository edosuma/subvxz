WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:02.868
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:02.870 --> 00:06.138
It's time for Snatch Game.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.039
(cheering)

00:07.041 --> 00:07.973
- Why don't you come on up

00:07.975 --> 00:10.476
and fuck me in the ass
sometime?

00:10.478 --> 00:11.410
- Oh.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.945
- They remove
their testicles.

00:12.947 --> 00:14.546
- (laughs)
- Brrr.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.682
- Is that a wig
on your head?

00:16.684 --> 00:18.650
- If you're not
wearing wigs,

00:18.652 --> 00:20.486
then you're not doing drag.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.188
- Let's hear you sing
to them.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.657
(no sound)

00:25.659 --> 00:26.692
Oh.

00:26.694 --> 00:30.562
Alaska,
you're a winner, baby.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.965
(applause)

00:32.967 --> 00:36.802
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

00:36.804 --> 00:41.140
- The queen
that I have chosen...

00:41.142 --> 00:42.341
is Tatianna.

00:42.343 --> 00:47.112
- Tatianna, sashay away.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.424
- (sighs)

00:58.426 --> 01:00.626
- Tatianna's been eliminated
and it's sad,

01:00.628 --> 01:07.066
because she's a fierce,
fierce, fierce queen.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.735
Oh, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
- Thank you.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.203
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.271
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:12.273 --> 01:15.274
- I think Tatianna's amazing,
and I'm really glad

01:15.276 --> 01:19.044
that she's sort of being
reintroduced to the world.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.412
- And I think that the fear
that she had

01:20.414 --> 01:23.949
about not getting the chance
to do that is unfounded.

01:23.951 --> 01:29.121
- Can I ask you what was
the determining factor for you?

01:30.124 --> 01:33.358
- Sure.
Roxxxy and Tatianna

01:33.360 --> 01:36.295
both floundered
in the Snatch Game,

01:36.297 --> 01:39.131
but Tatianna did not bring it
on the runway

01:39.133 --> 01:40.866
in the way that Roxxxy did.

01:40.868 --> 01:41.867
- Thank you.
- Yeah, girl.

01:41.869 --> 01:45.471
I'm proud of Alaska for going
off of the judges' critique,

01:45.473 --> 01:48.407
and I'm even more proud
that she kept her word.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.908
- Tatianna is an AllStar.

01:49.910 --> 01:53.078
- Some of us agreed it should
be based on judges' critiques

01:53.080 --> 01:55.547
who we send home, and if you're
the weakest link that week,

01:55.549 --> 01:58.650
then, sorry, but that's
just what we agreed on,

01:58.652 --> 01:59.751
and I think that's fair.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.688
Katya, can we ask who
you were gonna send home?

02:02.690 --> 02:04.256
- Oh, yeah. Um...

02:04.258 --> 02:06.225
I chose Tatianna as well

02:06.227 --> 02:08.794
for the same reason
that Alaska just said.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.162
Roxxxy slayed the runway.

02:10.164 --> 02:10.963
- Slayed.
- Slayed.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.731
- I feel like
in this instance,

02:12.733 --> 02:15.667
it was a lot easier
to be objective about it.

02:15.669 --> 02:16.201
- Yeah.

02:16.203 --> 02:17.336
- I know you wanted
to get critiqued.

02:17.338 --> 02:21.740
- I feel like I finally
really stepped outside of my box

02:21.742 --> 02:23.809
as far as the aesthetics go.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.712
So I'm safe for
the second week in a row.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.181
I felt like my Snatch Game
was really, really strong,

02:29.183 --> 02:32.184
and I'm giving
glamour toad realness.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.086
What the hell else
do I have to do

02:34.088 --> 02:36.188
to get a little recognition
in this gin joint?

02:36.190 --> 02:38.190
- Girl, we are
really sitting here.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.792
One, two, three, four,
five, six--eight.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.227
- There's seven.
- Seven.

02:42.229 --> 02:44.062
- One, two, three...
- You can't count.

02:44.064 --> 02:46.265
- Four, five, six--
top seven.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.966
- You were looking
at yourself in the mirror,

02:47.968 --> 02:49.434
so you counted
yourself twice.

02:49.436 --> 02:51.370
(all laugh)

02:51.372 --> 02:52.971
- Lookit! She's still
looking in the mirror.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.940
- She's just talking to herself
in the fucking mirror.

02:54.942 --> 02:55.974
- Ah-ha!

02:55.976 --> 02:57.042
- On that note...
- On that note...

02:57.044 --> 03:00.979
- Good day, good night,
you shady lady!

03:00.981 --> 03:02.181
(all laugh)

03:02.183 --> 03:03.315
- I love Alyssa,

03:03.317 --> 03:06.285
but someone needs
to take her go-go juice away

03:06.287 --> 03:07.519
'cause she's a little...

03:07.521 --> 03:09.388
- But you look so right!

03:09.390 --> 03:12.791
- Alyssa, take my hair off!

03:12.793 --> 03:13.959
(laughs)

03:13.961 --> 03:16.695
- I wish you would snatch
my wig, girl.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.496
I wish you would!

03:17.498 --> 03:20.065
Come on! Come on!
Come on, bitch!

03:20.067 --> 03:22.267
- Oh, my Jesus.
Just nonstop.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.770
I mean, at this point,
it's just background noise.

03:24.772 --> 03:28.040
I gotta focus on me.
I can't listen to this.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.942
(all laugh)

03:29.944 --> 03:31.777
She is funny sometimes.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.512
Sometimes.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.983
- Come get me up, baby.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.687
- The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race AllStars"

03:41.689 --> 03:42.921
receives a one-year supply

03:42.923 --> 03:45.390
of Anastasia
Beverly Hills cosmetics,

03:45.392 --> 03:48.360
a coveted spot in
the Drag Race Hall of Fame

03:48.362 --> 03:51.630
and a cash prize
of $100,000

03:51.632 --> 03:55.200
with extra special
guest judge Jeremy Scott.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.602
- ¶ RuPaul's Drag Race ¶

03:56.604 --> 03:57.836
- ¶ May the best woman ¶

03:57.838 --> 04:01.106
- ¶ Best woman win ¶

04:05.012 --> 04:06.712
- So it's a new day
in the workroom.

04:06.714 --> 04:10.983
I hate those new day
in the workroom bites.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.651
I have? Okay.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.186
It's a new day
in the workroom,

04:14.188 --> 04:16.288
and I'm feeling very good
and sexy

04:16.290 --> 04:19.825
and really grateful
to be here.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.262
(laughs)

04:23.264 --> 04:24.596
What kind of
vindictive machinations

04:24.598 --> 04:25.697
do you think
they've concocted?

04:25.699 --> 04:28.967
- I hope Todrick makes a video
and we're all in it.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.335
- That would be so rad.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.170
- Did he lend you
this jacket?

04:32.172 --> 04:34.273
- Log off, B. Log.

04:34.275 --> 04:37.442
- Don't log off.
Delete the account.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.577
(all laugh)

04:38.579 --> 04:39.444
- You're so stupid.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.979
Girl, you looked over
at Detox yesterday

04:40.981 --> 04:43.682
and said, you're a beast.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.183
Beast!
- Beast!

04:45.185 --> 04:45.751
- Beast!

04:45.753 --> 04:47.619
- You're like
the Gila monster, though.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.854
- You're a Gila monster.

04:48.856 --> 04:51.123
- If you are that grotted,

04:51.125 --> 04:56.995
you could be a monster,
a Gila monster or a beast.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.864
- Beast!
(all laugh)

04:58.866 --> 05:00.465
- Beast!

05:00.467 --> 05:02.367
- Hello, hello, hello.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.569
- Hi!
- Hi!

05:04.571 --> 05:07.639
- Ladies, for this week's
maxi challenge,

05:07.641 --> 05:11.743
you'll be performing
a lip sync extravaganza

05:11.745 --> 05:16.381
that salutes the baddest
bitches in herstory.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.150
#HerstoryOfTheWorld.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.184
- (snaps fingers)

05:19.186 --> 05:20.552
- Alaska, you'll play

05:20.554 --> 05:22.888
the original
naughty girl Eve.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.356
- Sss...

05:24.358 --> 05:27.426
- Phi Phi O'Hara, you'll play
the face, face, face

05:27.428 --> 05:32.164
that launched 1,000 ships,
Helen of Troy.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.098
- Oh.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.066
- Ginger Minj, you'll play

05:34.068 --> 05:38.337
Russian ruler supreme
Catherine the Great.

05:38.339 --> 05:42.240
Detox, you'll play
the queen of cakes.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.976
You know, cakes,

05:44.978 --> 05:47.079
Marie Antoinette.

05:47.081 --> 05:48.180
Alyssa Edwards, you'll play

05:48.182 --> 05:52.718
gun-slinging superstar
Annie Oakley.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.086
Roxxxy Andrews, you'll play

05:54.088 --> 05:58.590
Argentina's former
first lady Eva Peron.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.958
And Katya, you'll play

05:59.960 --> 06:04.162
the people's princess,
Diana, Princess of Wales.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.998
Now, ladies, you'll be
performing together,

06:07.000 --> 06:11.069
but you need to do whatever
it takes to steal the show.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.170
Later today,
you'll be meeting

06:12.172 --> 06:17.642
with choreographers Ant and Ash
from the Squared Division.

06:17.644 --> 06:18.477
- Nice.
(applause)

06:18.479 --> 06:19.745
- And you know
they work with

06:19.747 --> 06:25.350
pop goddesses Britney,
Taylor Swift, Kylie Minogue.

06:25.352 --> 06:28.053
So don't fuck it up.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.555
(laughs)
(applause)

06:32.659 --> 06:35.093
- Oh, is that--that's
the Helen of Troy outfit?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.395
- It is.
- (gasps)

06:36.397 --> 06:39.097
It is so cool.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.465
Can I try it on?
- Yeah.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.300
(crunch)
- Um, okay.

06:42.302 --> 06:43.135
You need to calm down.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.337
I thought
that you had resolved

06:45.339 --> 06:47.272
all this anger
from your season.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.074
This is so cool.
This is so pretty.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.308
- Thank you.

06:50.310 --> 06:53.145
- Thank God you're talented
at something.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.283
- My dress is so shitty
compared to everybody else's.

06:58.285 --> 07:01.019
- I think this is the most
iconic Diana, though.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.288
- Yeah. It's just
a little wrinkly.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.624
During my season,
we had a similar challenge,

07:05.626 --> 07:08.827
and I bombed it so hard,
it landed me in the bottom.

07:08.829 --> 07:09.995
Damn, girl.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.430
- It's long.
- It's really long.

07:11.432 --> 07:15.867
We could literally perform
the number on your train.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.103
- What I've come to realize

07:18.105 --> 07:20.605
is that I have to cut off
the fucking train.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.174
And now it's just
a simple wedding dress,

07:22.176 --> 07:25.544
but there's just absolutely
no way I can perform with it on,

07:25.546 --> 07:28.447
even though it is
my dead grandmother's dress.

07:28.449 --> 07:31.349
It's actually my friend's
dead grandma's dress.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.718
Rest in peace, grandma.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.254
Oh, my God.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.191
- Girl, I need to--I need to--
I need to--I need to--

07:39.193 --> 07:42.294
I need to get up in this
Annie Oakley get-up gig.

07:42.296 --> 07:46.498
On season 5, I hated playing
anything other than Alyssa.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.599
But I want to prove to Ru

07:47.601 --> 07:51.470
that I'm more
than just some pageant queen

07:51.472 --> 07:53.104
that can kick and twirl.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.239
I can be a character.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.707
- What are you doing
with your hair?

07:55.709 --> 07:58.543
- I think I like her.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.278
- Oh.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.656
- Girl, you better believe

08:11.658 --> 08:13.558
I'm gonna do my best
to steal the show.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.660
That's the name
of this game.

08:17.331 --> 08:20.131
- Alyssa's like fuckin
batshit fuckin funny, crazy,

08:20.133 --> 08:22.801
but I don't think she knows
how to really channel that

08:22.803 --> 08:26.071
into, like, the acting
or, like, the comedy.

08:28.509 --> 08:31.343
She's definitely a star.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.678
She's feeling it. Like,
she thinks she's sickening.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.780
- Girl, please.
- Alyssa's too concerned

08:35.782 --> 08:37.949
about how many GIFs
she can get made after this,

08:37.951 --> 08:42.254
and, you know, what T-shirt
she's gonna sell next.

08:44.124 --> 08:44.723
- Coming up...

08:44.725 --> 08:49.060
- I'm Annie Oakley
and this is my band.

08:50.597 --> 08:51.963
- Okay.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.932
This can be
obviously really funny.

08:53.934 --> 08:57.569
It kind of looks like
you're taking a shit.

08:58.572 --> 09:01.006
(RuPaul laughs)

09:01.775 --> 09:04.976
(RuPaul laughs)

09:04.978 --> 09:05.877
- Hello.
- Hi.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.413
- Hi.
- Welcome.

09:08.415 --> 09:09.714
- Our maxi challenge
this week

09:09.716 --> 09:12.284
is a bad girl
lip sync extravaganza.

09:12.286 --> 09:13.285
Now it's time to hit
that main stage

09:13.287 --> 09:16.187
and start rehearsing our
choreography with Ash and Ant.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.223
- Hi, I'm Ashley.
- Hey, I'm Anthony.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.691
- And together, we're
the Squared Division.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.092
It's wonderful
to meet you all.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.261
- Oh, my gosh, I'm
fan-girling a little bit.

09:23.263 --> 09:27.032
Two choreographers
that I respect so much.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.066
They're beyond creative.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.301
- Catherine the Great.

09:29.303 --> 09:31.670
So Ginger, are you a dancer?

09:31.672 --> 09:33.038
- Nope.
- No.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.973
- I'm a Tony Danza.
- (laughs)

09:34.975 --> 09:36.074
- So you've got
a lot to deal with

09:36.076 --> 09:38.143
'cause you're gonna use
a horse prop.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.511
You'll use it like a cane.

09:39.513 --> 09:40.979
- I'm a little resentful
at Ginger

09:40.981 --> 09:43.949
because she gets the part
not only that's Russian,

09:43.951 --> 09:45.383
but also fucks a horse.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.418
(horse neighs)

09:46.420 --> 09:47.786
- My dress is huge.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.721
It's got a cape with
a little bit of a train.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.656
- Gosh, you've got a lot
to contend with, don't you?

09:51.658 --> 09:54.159
- I do.
- Okay, so from after this,

09:54.161 --> 09:56.161
you'll bring it
behind your head and...

09:56.163 --> 09:57.662
- Okay. Oh! Sorry.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.130
This is going very well.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.498
Well, I'm a little
freaked out.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.167
Not only is dancing
not my strong suit,

10:02.169 --> 10:04.836
as anybody who watched
Season 7 will attest to,

10:04.838 --> 10:08.273
I also have this giant
Catherine the Great costume.

10:08.275 --> 10:13.311
¶ Every Tom, Dick or Igor
and even Mr. Ed ¶

10:13.814 --> 10:14.613
- It's just timing.

10:14.615 --> 10:15.614
And your dress
is not gonna help.

10:15.616 --> 10:18.984
- Coming into "AllStars"
with a group of gals

10:18.986 --> 10:22.921
who are so larger than life
and so amazing at what they do,

10:22.923 --> 10:24.189
it's a little intimidating.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.590
But I can't let that
get to me.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.792
I've got to get
right back in there.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.996
¶ All of Russia
is my shtomping ground ¶

10:30.998 --> 10:33.231
- Yes, exactly.
Gorgeous.

10:33.233 --> 10:33.898
- I may be 5'2,

10:33.900 --> 10:37.402
but I'm gonna stand above
all these other motherfuckers.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.603
Ha!
- That's better.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.270
We're moving on.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.107
- Stay and stay and then you
guys can just take a rest.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.842
- Okay.

10:51.918 --> 10:54.285
- I like Phi Phi a lot,

10:54.287 --> 10:58.556
but I think Phi Phi had
certain notions in her head

10:58.558 --> 11:00.659
when she walked into
this competition

11:00.661 --> 11:02.494
about what she needed to do

11:02.496 --> 11:05.230
to redeem her reputation
from her season,

11:05.232 --> 11:08.266
what she needed to do
to last a while,

11:08.268 --> 11:09.300
and all of those things

11:09.302 --> 11:12.937
don't necessarily mesh well
with one another.

11:17.110 --> 11:20.645
So sometimes it feels like
she goes out of her way

11:20.647 --> 11:22.647
to ruffle somebody's feathers

11:22.649 --> 11:26.484
or to plant a seed
of self doubt.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.319
It's weird.
- All right.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.288
Annie.
So we shoot.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.289
(imitates gunshots)

11:31.291 --> 11:34.859
I'm Annie Oakley,
and this is my band.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.362
- During rehearsal,
I'm ready to work.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.663
Bitch is clocked in.

11:38.665 --> 11:39.798
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.232
You stumble.
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

11:41.234 --> 11:45.070
And your gun shoots--
shoots all the girls down.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.105
Exactly.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.273
- Bang, bang.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.708
- Yeah, bang.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.342
Ha! The steps are there.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.411
You need to now
work on the balance

11:53.413 --> 11:54.979
between it looking hot
and proper,

11:54.981 --> 11:55.780
'cause you're a dancer,

11:55.782 --> 11:59.417
but then characterizing that
at the same time.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.419
- Okay.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.558
- (off-mike) And that's decent.
Walk into, um...

12:06.560 --> 12:08.793
(continues off-mike,
indistinct)

12:09.162 --> 12:10.495
- All right,
let's move on.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.196
Marie Antoinette.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.965
Detox, you're gonna
give it, like, almost like

12:13.967 --> 12:17.302
a<i> chasse, pas de bourree,</i>
and then<i> soutenu.</i>

12:17.304 --> 12:19.003
- What the fuck?

12:19.005 --> 12:22.474
-<i> Chasse, pas de bourree,</i>
<i> soutenu.</i>

12:22.476 --> 12:25.543
It's step, cut, cut, cut,
phoom, phoom.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.912
It has to be like a little,
um, a little waltz.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.114
Let me see that again.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.148
- And be funnier.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.783
- All right. Ooh.

12:31.785 --> 12:35.253
- It kind of looks like
you're taking a shit.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.387
- Yeah.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.356
- This can be obviously
really funny,

12:38.358 --> 12:40.024
and I don't think
it's quite that funny yet.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.092
It's missing something.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.294
- Right now, I'm just trying
to focus on this little bit,

12:43.296 --> 12:45.196
so I'm, like, in here.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.064
- Okay.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.332
- I'm not believing it.

12:47.334 --> 12:50.468
- It could be so funny,
and I'm not getting that.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.338
- A lot of work to do.

12:57.144 --> 13:00.111
- This is the baddest bitches
in herstory, honey.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.780
- I'm sitting next
to the baddest bitch

13:01.782 --> 13:07.852
in RuPaul's Drag Race herstory
right here, if you ask me.

13:07.854 --> 13:09.487
You were like, this bitch
is annoying me,

13:09.489 --> 13:12.090
so I'm going to fuckin
talk about her.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.024
- I have no apologies.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.926
I wasn't going to be
something I wasn't.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.094
Alyssa, you know this.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.829
Like, that drag
just was not something

13:17.831 --> 13:19.197
I grew up with in Texas.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.966
It was all about how many
pageant titles you had.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.268
So when I see someone
like Sharon

13:23.270 --> 13:24.602
and I saw that
she was winning everything

13:24.604 --> 13:25.603
and I saw her as,
like, a threat

13:25.605 --> 13:27.605
and I think that's where
a lot of the anger came from.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.874
It didn't help me
afterwards.

13:29.876 --> 13:30.742
- What happened afterwards?

13:30.744 --> 13:32.644
- I think that people
couldn't look past.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.647
I watch reality TV and I don't
like people on there, too,

13:35.649 --> 13:37.415
but I would never go
and, like, threaten them

13:37.417 --> 13:39.284
or want to throw acid
in their face.

13:39.286 --> 13:42.453
- People threaten
to throw acid on your face?

13:42.455 --> 13:43.354
- Yeah.
Actually, in L.A.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.558
You know who really
hated me during my season?

13:46.560 --> 13:48.092
Detox.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.761
- Really?
- Did you?

13:49.763 --> 13:53.565
- I was evil to her because
there was this fucking cunt

13:53.567 --> 13:54.966
who was evil and rotten
to everybody

13:54.968 --> 13:57.602
and, of course, I wanted
to protect my sister.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.736
That's my family,
you know what I mean?

13:58.738 --> 14:01.039
So, like, every week, I would,
like, attack three people.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.740
You blocked me
for a while, too.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.642
Here in California, we
all look after each other,

14:04.644 --> 14:08.446
and so when somebody
is coming for our girls,

14:08.448 --> 14:10.582
we are in full attack mode.

14:10.584 --> 14:12.183
- Did that ever hurt
your feelings, though?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.918
- I literally had
one breakdown moment,

14:13.920 --> 14:16.054
and I remember
crying in the car.

14:16.056 --> 14:16.955
- Aw.

14:16.957 --> 14:17.655
- After season 4,

14:17.657 --> 14:21.125
there was a slight period
of time I almost quit drag.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.894
It was just
too much to handle.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.662
I just didn't feel safe
going anywhere.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.532
People really take it seriously
and they wanted to hurt me.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.068
So they just were, like, maybe
it's best you don't show up.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.469
- That is insane.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.170
- That is awful.

14:32.172 --> 14:35.506
- Obviously, time has passed,
we're friends.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.208
But I do feel bad.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.877
I feel guilty
and a little responsible

14:38.879 --> 14:42.080
for making her afraid
of West Hollywood.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.016
- I just hope
that there's a movement

14:45.018 --> 14:48.686
toward people being
a little less awful

14:48.688 --> 14:50.455
and hateful on social media.

14:50.457 --> 14:53.858
Treating people that way
is, like, so unacceptable.

14:53.860 --> 14:54.492
- No, totally.

14:54.494 --> 14:59.697
- I think that people are people
and we do the best we can.

14:59.699 --> 15:03.067
And if you're attacking
someone online

15:03.069 --> 15:05.370
who you think is a monster,

15:05.372 --> 15:09.440
then maybe you're a monster
inside.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.241
Be nice.

15:10.243 --> 15:14.746
Fuck's sake,
it's just drag.

15:17.017 --> 15:17.849
- Coming up...

15:17.851 --> 15:24.555
- ¶ Herstory, yes ¶

15:26.660 --> 15:29.060
(RuPaul laughs)

15:29.863 --> 15:32.697
(RuPaul laughs)

15:35.001 --> 15:38.603
- ¶ Covergirl, put the bass
in your walk ¶

15:38.605 --> 15:40.638
(echoing)
¶ Walk ¶

15:42.375 --> 15:45.710
¶ Covergirl, put the bass
in your walk ¶

15:45.712 --> 15:49.981
¶ Head to toe,
let your whole body talk ¶

15:49.983 --> 15:52.583
¶ Covergirl ¶
- Whoo-whoo.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.720
(RuPaul laughs)

15:55.722 --> 15:56.754
- Welcome to the main stage

15:56.756 --> 15:59.757
of "RuPaul's
Drag Race AllStars."

15:59.759 --> 16:03.161
The baddest girl I know,
Michelle Visage.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.263
- And when I'm bad,
I'm better.

16:05.265 --> 16:08.833
- (laughs) Style superstar
Carson Kressley,

16:08.835 --> 16:11.502
are you ready
for a herstory lesson?

16:11.504 --> 16:14.205
- Oh, yes.
Teach me a lesson, mama.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.407
- The incredible
Todrick Hall.

16:16.409 --> 16:19.310
It's your first lip sync
extravaganza.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.447
- And after tonight,
I will no longer be a virgin.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.047
- Oh, dear.

16:23.049 --> 16:26.150
And the people's designer,
Jeremy Scott.

16:26.152 --> 16:29.320
So glad you're here.
Love the shirt.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.622
- My mother and father
designed it for me.

16:31.624 --> 16:32.490
(all laugh)

16:32.492 --> 16:34.759
- This week,
we challenged our queens

16:34.761 --> 16:37.795
to celebrate the baddest
bitches in herstory,

16:37.797 --> 16:43.368
and then on the runway,
category is The Future of Drag.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.970
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

16:45.972 --> 16:49.173
and may the best woman win.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.879
- Hey, it's me, God.

16:54.881 --> 16:58.616
Good girls may go to heaven,
but bad girls rule the world.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.818
Who's the baddest bitch
in herstory?

17:00.820 --> 17:03.254
Well, who am I to judge?

17:07.093 --> 17:11.329
- ¶ In the beginning,
there were one, two, three ¶

17:11.331 --> 17:15.433
¶ Adam and me
and my best friend Steve ¶

17:15.435 --> 17:18.836
¶ They started making out
in front of me ¶

17:18.838 --> 17:22.840
¶ That's when I told them that
they had to leave, get out ¶

17:22.842 --> 17:24.575
¶ But they took
all the food from me ¶

17:24.577 --> 17:26.878
¶ Except the apple
on the tree ¶

17:26.880 --> 17:28.679
¶ It was forbidden ¶

17:28.681 --> 17:30.681
¶ God, are you kidding? ¶

17:30.683 --> 17:32.717
¶ Then the snake
told me to bake ¶

17:32.719 --> 17:35.486
¶ An apple pie
and not a cake ¶

17:35.488 --> 17:36.854
¶ So I did it ¶

17:36.856 --> 17:39.157
¶ I went and bit it ¶

17:39.159 --> 17:40.691
¶ And then everything
went to shit ¶

17:40.693 --> 17:43.227
¶ and I realized
I was naked ¶

17:43.229 --> 17:45.329
What?

17:45.331 --> 17:46.864
That's right.

17:46.866 --> 17:50.468
- ¶ The most beautiful face
in the world ¶

17:50.470 --> 17:52.804
¶ That launched
1,000 ships ¶

17:52.806 --> 17:56.040
¶ She mesmerized us
with her smile ¶

17:56.042 --> 17:59.110
¶ But, oy,
when she opens her lips ¶

17:59.112 --> 18:00.144
(heavy metal music)

18:00.146 --> 18:04.949
¶ Troy, Troy,
I'm Helen of Troy ¶

18:04.951 --> 18:07.118
¶ Troy, I'm Helen of Troy ¶

18:07.120 --> 18:08.753
¶ I'm Helen of Troy ¶

18:08.755 --> 18:11.055
¶ Yeah, I'm Helen of Troy ¶

18:11.057 --> 18:13.291
¶ Yeah, I'm Helen of Troy ¶

18:13.293 --> 18:15.493
¶ Troy, I'm Helen of Troy ¶

18:15.495 --> 18:17.695
¶ I'm Helen of Troy ¶

18:23.736 --> 18:25.937
¶ I'm Helen of Troy ¶

18:25.939 --> 18:29.407
(hoofbeats)

18:29.876 --> 18:32.410
- ¶ I had a great many lovers
that I took to bed ¶

18:32.412 --> 18:34.846
¶ Every Tom, Dick and Igor
and even Mr. Ed ¶

18:34.848 --> 18:37.915
¶ There's more of me to love
with these few extra pounds ¶

18:37.917 --> 18:41.419
¶ Everybody knows
I like to horse around ¶

18:41.421 --> 18:44.122
- (whinny)
- ¶ Horse around ¶

18:44.124 --> 18:46.057
¶ Giddyap and get down ¶

18:46.059 --> 18:47.258
¶ I said, giddyap ¶

18:47.260 --> 18:49.627
¶ Horse around ¶

18:49.629 --> 18:52.597
¶ Come and take a ride
on my merry-go-round ¶

18:52.599 --> 18:54.365
¶ Horse around ¶

18:54.367 --> 18:55.333
(neighs)

18:55.335 --> 18:58.202
¶ Get down, get down,
get down, get down ¶

18:58.204 --> 19:00.304
¶ Horse around ¶

19:00.306 --> 19:03.941
¶ All of Russia
is my shtomping ground ¶

19:03.943 --> 19:05.710
("Call to Post" plays)

19:05.712 --> 19:08.279
I got a nice big carrot.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.281
Dah!

19:10.283 --> 19:12.750
- If you are looking
to start a revolution,

19:12.752 --> 19:15.319
I created
a social media solution.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.489
Put on your opulent jewels,
air and dress,

19:18.491 --> 19:23.361
and say it
in 140 characters or less

19:23.363 --> 19:25.062
¶ Let them eat cake ¶

19:25.064 --> 19:25.963
¶ Let them eat cake ¶

19:25.965 --> 19:30.034
¶ Let them eat cake,
cake, cake, cake, cake ¶

19:30.036 --> 19:33.571
¶ Let them eat ca-a-a-ke ¶

19:33.573 --> 19:36.574
¶ Let them eat
ca-uh-uh-ke ¶

19:36.576 --> 19:39.644
¶ Let them eat
ca-hoo-ha-hoo-- ¶

19:39.646 --> 19:49.387
(inhales)
¶ Ca-a-ake ¶

19:49.389 --> 20:00.798
¶ Let them eat cake ¶

20:01.868 --> 20:02.433
(gunshots)

20:02.435 --> 20:05.903
- I'm Annie Oakley,
and this is my band.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.506
The Sharpshooters.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.508
Five, six!
(gunshots)

20:10.510 --> 20:12.176
¶ Been on my own
since I was young ¶

20:12.178 --> 20:14.745
¶ Came out my mama
with a gun ¶

20:14.747 --> 20:17.315
¶ A better shot
than anyone ¶

20:17.317 --> 20:18.783
No one can beat me.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.918
¶ But there's a story
y'all don't know ¶

20:20.920 --> 20:23.254
¶ My draw was fast
and his was slow ¶

20:23.256 --> 20:26.023
¶ It really was
his time to go ¶

20:26.025 --> 20:28.726
Ha-ha!
¶ So I went bang, bang ¶

20:28.728 --> 20:29.560
(gunshots)

20:29.562 --> 20:30.828
¶ Bang, bang ¶
(gunshots)

20:30.830 --> 20:34.432
¶ These double barrels
pumped him full of lead ¶

20:34.434 --> 20:35.066
(gunshots)

20:35.068 --> 20:37.668
¶ I went bang, bang ¶
(gunshots)

20:37.670 --> 20:39.537
¶ Bang, bang ¶
(gunshots)

20:39.539 --> 20:42.573
¶ He's six feet under
lying in my bed ¶

20:42.575 --> 20:46.077
(gunshots)
Well, I guess I'm done.

20:46.079 --> 20:49.280
Yippy-yi-ki-gay.

20:52.185 --> 20:56.520
- ¶ I'm Eva Peron, so honey,
don't you cry for me ¶

20:56.522 --> 21:00.224
¶ I'm an actress, not a diva
and the first lady ¶

21:00.226 --> 21:05.329
¶ I give the people hope
for a better<i> mañana</i> ¶

21:05.331 --> 21:07.365
¶ I was Evita, after all ¶

21:07.367 --> 21:09.867
¶ I played it better
than Madonna ¶

21:09.869 --> 21:12.303
¶ I did it for the rights,
I did it for the kids ¶

21:12.305 --> 21:14.138
¶ I did it
for the sick and poor ¶

21:14.140 --> 21:16.607
¶ I did it for the fame,
I did it for the money ¶

21:16.609 --> 21:18.809
¶ I did it
'cause I wanted more ¶

21:18.811 --> 21:21.279
¶ I gave the people joy,
I gave the people life ¶

21:21.281 --> 21:25.016
¶ I gave the people drama ¶

21:25.018 --> 21:27.752
¶ And I did it,
oh, yes, I did it ¶

21:27.754 --> 21:33.658
¶ Better than Madonna ¶

21:38.431 --> 21:41.866
- I'm Princess Di,
I'm very shy ¶

21:41.868 --> 21:45.336
¶ And the world
fell in love with my eyes ¶

21:45.338 --> 21:48.539
¶ To everyone,
I was his wife ¶

21:48.541 --> 21:52.143
¶ And we lived out
a fairytale life ¶

21:52.145 --> 21:55.813
¶ And then,
shit hit the fan ¶

21:55.815 --> 21:58.049
¶ I got divorced from my man ¶

21:58.051 --> 22:00.918
¶ They made me
give up my crown ¶

22:00.920 --> 22:12.263
¶ But they can't keep
a girl down ¶

22:12.265 --> 22:13.331
Be careful what you wish for

22:13.333 --> 22:16.767
'cause this English rose
has thorns.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.874
- ¶ They say
it's a man's world we miss ¶

22:23.876 --> 22:26.344
¶ So, girl, we've been
breaking the rules ¶

22:26.346 --> 22:27.478
- ¶ And it started with me ¶

22:27.480 --> 22:38.556
- ¶ We're the baddest bitches
in herstory ¶

22:38.558 --> 22:40.157
Yes!

22:40.159 --> 22:43.694
(cheers and applause)

22:46.699 --> 22:47.698
- Coming up...

22:47.700 --> 22:48.632
- You're a star.

22:48.634 --> 22:49.800
- It left us gagging.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.903
- Listen, everybody
was so fantastic,

22:52.905 --> 22:56.173
but decisions must be made.

22:56.776 --> 22:59.210
(RuPaul laughs)

22:59.979 --> 23:02.580
(RuPaul laughs)

23:02.582 --> 23:04.248
- ¶ Drag queen ¶

23:04.250 --> 23:05.916
¶ Sexy, sexy drag queen ¶

23:05.918 --> 23:10.855
- Serving the future
of drag, Alaska.

23:10.857 --> 23:15.259
In the future, if you're not
wearing three-foot nails,

23:15.261 --> 23:16.927
you're not doing drag.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.463
- Aah!

23:19.465 --> 23:24.835
I'm serving alien
princess ele-gwanza.

23:24.837 --> 23:28.339
- The higher the hair,
the closer to Uranus.

23:28.341 --> 23:29.373
- Yes.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.375
- Aah!

23:31.978 --> 23:34.245
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- C3P-ho.

23:34.247 --> 23:37.314
- This outfit really embodies
everything that Phi Phi is now.

23:37.316 --> 23:38.682
Like, she's a cosplay queen.

23:38.684 --> 23:41.619
She's not trying to be
this pageant queen anymore.

23:41.621 --> 23:44.955
- Set phasers to stunning.

23:44.957 --> 23:48.559
Ginger Minj,
<i> voulez-vous coucher.</i>

23:48.561 --> 23:50.060
- In my delicate
little mind,

23:50.062 --> 23:52.496
the way I picture
the future of drag

23:52.498 --> 23:57.435
is that whole retro Brady Bunch
space age kind of design.

23:57.437 --> 24:00.337
- In the future, we'll all
have hair like Chaka Khan.

24:00.339 --> 24:02.339
- Yes, we will.

24:02.341 --> 24:03.607
Detox.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.209
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.611
Oh, my God!

24:07.613 --> 24:08.112
- Aah!

24:08.114 --> 24:11.482
- I'm practically naked
walking down the runway,

24:11.484 --> 24:15.486
and I look like a sexy,
silver fembot fuck toy.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.955
- She's serving
the fifth element,

24:17.957 --> 24:21.325
the sixth element,
and magnesium.

24:21.327 --> 24:22.593
- (laughs)

24:22.595 --> 24:24.328
- Alyssa Edwards.

24:24.330 --> 24:26.130
- She's horny, baby.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.332
- Girl, I got
my beaded wig on, girl.

24:28.334 --> 24:30.634
I got the horns.
I got the moon boots.

24:30.636 --> 24:33.070
I am giving y'all
everything.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.072
- Oh, I just noticed
the boots.

24:35.074 --> 24:35.940
- Yeah.
(all laugh)

24:35.942 --> 24:38.642
- Now, is that a fascinator
on her head

24:38.644 --> 24:40.177
or a doggy bag?

24:40.179 --> 24:41.545
- Ha-ha!

24:41.547 --> 24:43.714
- Roxxxy Andrews.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.983
- Ugh!
- She just fixed herself.

24:45.985 --> 24:46.584
- (laughs)

24:46.586 --> 24:48.352
- I feel like a warrior
in my outfit.

24:48.354 --> 24:53.691
It's Wonder Woman/goddess
of planet Roxxxy.

24:53.693 --> 24:56.694
- Space age face
with an Oakland booty.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.496
(all laugh)

24:58.498 --> 25:00.097
Katya. Whoo.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.867
- I'm pretty sure this is my
Aunt Harriet at a Bat mitzvah.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.802
- I'm giving you
intergalactic mom.

25:04.804 --> 25:08.639
The piece de resistance of
this outfit is the giant hair.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.774
It's kind of like a doughnut
on acid.

25:10.776 --> 25:14.011
It is the most glamorous I've
ever looked in my entire life.

25:14.013 --> 25:17.281
- Live long and prostitute.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.283
(all laugh)

25:19.285 --> 25:19.984
Welcome, ladies.

25:19.986 --> 25:23.487
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

25:23.489 --> 25:26.190
First up, Alaska.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.325
- Aah!

25:28.327 --> 25:29.493
- Aah!

25:29.495 --> 25:32.229
- Huh.
(all laugh)

25:32.231 --> 25:34.899
- Your Eve
was truly enjoyable.

25:34.901 --> 25:35.766
You started off the show,

25:35.768 --> 25:38.235
so you needed to nail that
and you did.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.637
- Tonight,
the future of drag.

25:39.639 --> 25:42.039
Yes, it's great,
it's fun, it's Alaska.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.674
But Alaska is an alien

25:43.676 --> 25:45.609
and comes from
the planet Glamtron.

25:45.611 --> 25:48.612
I was expecting you to go
completely all the way.

25:48.614 --> 25:51.248
- Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.850
- As far as
scene-stealing went,

25:52.852 --> 25:55.119
to me, you did fade in
the background a little bit,

25:55.121 --> 25:57.621
but I will say
tonight on the runway,

25:57.623 --> 26:01.091
this is really,
really fantastic work.

26:01.093 --> 26:01.759
- Thank you.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.127
- Yeah, the laser gun
is amazing,

26:03.129 --> 26:04.895
and you didn't give us
just silver,

26:04.897 --> 26:05.729
which I'm seeing a lot of.

26:05.731 --> 26:08.465
- I am so proud of you,
as far as evolution goes,

26:08.467 --> 26:11.702
from where you were in your
season to where you are now.

26:11.704 --> 26:12.469
- Yay.

26:12.471 --> 26:14.872
- Up next, Ginger Minj.

26:14.874 --> 26:18.542
- You should have
a one-woman show on Broadway.

26:18.544 --> 26:19.176
You're a star.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.678
- But there were some moments
where I was like,

26:20.680 --> 26:22.012
oh, look, she's still in,
and then some moments

26:22.014 --> 26:23.113
she kind of faded
into the background.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.349
- This look is not
one of my favorites.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.418
There's a whole lot
of everything going on.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.687
Like, I need Ritalin
to look at you right now.

26:29.689 --> 26:33.023
- Yeah. It's just
a little bit wah-wah.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.225
- Well, these light up,
all these things light up.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.794
- Why aren't they?
- They are lit up.

26:36.796 --> 26:39.063
I just didn't realize
you couldn't see them.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.031
- Oh, right.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.199
- I actually quite liked it

26:42.201 --> 26:43.701
'cause don't take this
in the wrong way,

26:43.703 --> 26:47.204
I felt like you were channeling
Miss Piggy, "Pigs in Space."

26:47.206 --> 26:50.341
- (laughs)
- Up next, Detox.

26:50.343 --> 26:52.142
- I loved Ne-Antoinette.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.511
She could've been
a whole collection.

26:54.513 --> 26:58.148
And, of course, your iconic
jaw movement was at play there.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.150
- And then
you came out tonight.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.586
What you did and the way
you executed it,

27:02.588 --> 27:04.622
it left us gagging.

27:04.624 --> 27:06.824
- Thank you very much.
(sniffles)

27:06.826 --> 27:09.727
- Don't cry, Detox.
You'll rust.

27:09.729 --> 27:10.561
(all laugh)

27:10.563 --> 27:14.932
Up next, the always understated
Alyssa Edwards.

27:14.934 --> 27:18.268
- Annie got her gun and she
murdered the competition.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.937
I could not
take my eyes off you.

27:19.939 --> 27:22.706
- Yeah, and the challenge was,
you know, stealing the scene.

27:22.708 --> 27:24.908
You stole the show.
- Thank you.

27:24.910 --> 27:28.345
- But I have no idea
what is going on tonight.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.448
We are part Cleopatra,
part Saturday night takeaway.

27:31.450 --> 27:34.184
- I will just
come out of the closet here

27:34.186 --> 27:36.987
and say that this is fashion
and I love it.

27:36.989 --> 27:40.290
- It's just epic and only you
could pull this off.

27:40.292 --> 27:41.625
- Thank you very much.

27:41.627 --> 27:44.561
- Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.

27:44.563 --> 27:46.930
- Don't cry for me,
Roxxxy Andrews.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.533
Your Evita was spot on.

27:49.535 --> 27:50.534
- But tonight on the runway,

27:50.536 --> 27:53.103
I do think this is plain
compared to everybody else.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.773
- Maybe this isn't
my favorite of the looks,

27:55.775 --> 27:57.307
but it's very
Queen of the Night,

27:57.309 --> 27:59.309
Whitney Houston kind of,
um...

27:59.311 --> 28:01.945
- Buy "The Bodyguard"
soundtrack, track 9.

28:01.947 --> 28:03.580
(all laugh)

28:03.582 --> 28:05.315
- Up next, Katya.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.184
- I love that you took
Princess Leia's bun

28:07.186 --> 28:10.354
and blew it up and made
one giant hairdo out of it.

28:10.356 --> 28:13.390
- Right, but I'm not just crazy
about the outfit.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.426
I think it's a little too
covered up.

28:15.428 --> 28:16.493
And your Princess Diana,

28:16.495 --> 28:20.164
the overall performance was
a little monotone for me.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.198
- It felt almost
a bit solemn.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.568
- But I felt that out of all
the lip syncs, you were spot on.

28:24.570 --> 28:28.272
- But I wish the sleeves
were obnoxiously poofed

28:28.274 --> 28:28.972
like the gown was.

28:28.974 --> 28:30.841
I wish you had
a 5,000 foot train.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.310
Also, the hair was more
like Ellen DeGeneres

28:33.312 --> 28:34.611
than it was Princess Di
for me.

28:34.613 --> 28:37.414
- It needed to be more of that
feathered back iconic look

28:37.416 --> 28:39.983
so we're not figuring it out
from the lyrics.

28:39.985 --> 28:41.652
- Now, in Katya's defense,

28:41.654 --> 28:44.021
Princess Diana
is really the only figure

28:44.023 --> 28:46.223
that we remember
what she looked like.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.326
The other characters
were open to interpretation.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.361
Listen, everybody
was so fantastic,

28:51.363 --> 28:54.998
so we have to pick at
some of the smaller things

28:55.000 --> 28:58.402
because ain't much
to criticize here.

28:59.338 --> 29:02.606
But decisions must be made.

29:02.608 --> 29:06.009
So based on
the judges' critiques,

29:06.011 --> 29:13.117
I declare that Detox
and Alyssa Edwards,

29:13.119 --> 29:15.552
you are the top two AllStars
of the week.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.921
- Congratulations.
(applause)

29:17.923 --> 29:21.525
- You've each won
a three-night getaway

29:21.527 --> 29:24.261
to Palm Springs, California,

29:24.263 --> 29:28.298
from
VacationPalmSprings.com.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.201
Con-drag-ulations.
- Thank you.

29:31.403 --> 29:35.873
- When I call your name,
please step forward.

29:36.909 --> 29:39.743
Ginger Minj.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.411
Katya.

29:41.413 --> 29:45.449
You are the bottom two
of the week.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.652
- Oh, good Lord.

29:48.654 --> 29:50.621
Being in the bottom two
is bad enough.

29:50.623 --> 29:54.992
Being in the bottom two
against my best friend is worse.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.561
I don't like how this
is going to end either way.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.096
- That means Detox
and Alyssa,

29:59.098 --> 30:03.767
each of you needs to decide
which of the bottom two

30:03.769 --> 30:08.138
you will eliminate
if you win the lip sync.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.673
- (sighs)

30:10.176 --> 30:12.643
- So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

30:12.645 --> 30:17.181
the judges and I will be
giving each other mani-pedis.

30:18.551 --> 30:20.784
You may leave the stage.

30:20.786 --> 30:22.052
Coming up...

30:22.054 --> 30:25.289
- Do you think
that the girls in the top

30:25.291 --> 30:27.191
are going to stick
to our idea

30:27.193 --> 30:29.326
of what did the judges
have to say

30:29.328 --> 30:31.495
and that's who
we're going to choose?

30:31.497 --> 30:33.330
- I'm iffy of one of them.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.731
- Who?

30:36.902 --> 30:39.303
(RuPaul laughs)

30:40.105 --> 30:42.973
(RuPaul laughs)

30:44.376 --> 30:46.243
- (sighs)

30:46.245 --> 30:48.345
I feel like
this is going to be

30:48.347 --> 30:52.182
a really difficult
deliberation.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.250
All of the critiques

30:53.252 --> 30:56.687
were really, like,
equal across the board.

30:56.689 --> 31:01.892
I mean, Katya's critiques were
slightly worse the Ginger's,

31:01.894 --> 31:03.894
but, still, it's very close.

31:03.896 --> 31:07.097
- Congratulations still go out
to everyone, honestly,

31:07.099 --> 31:11.034
because, girl, we killed.
- What a fucking show.

31:11.036 --> 31:11.568
- Right?

31:11.570 --> 31:13.170
- Did they really rate
anybody's performance?

31:13.172 --> 31:17.441
- Uh, yeah, they said mine
was, like, solemn.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.178
- Katya, come here.

31:24.483 --> 31:25.549
I wanted to call you out
over here

31:25.551 --> 31:27.584
'cause I just kind of saw that
you're going through something.

31:27.586 --> 31:28.418
Are you okay?

31:28.420 --> 31:30.254
- Um, on my season,

31:30.256 --> 31:34.791
I was just like crippled
with, you know, with fear.

31:34.793 --> 31:37.327
And then, this time,
coming here,

31:37.329 --> 31:41.632
I feel like
an enormous change.

31:41.634 --> 31:43.967
I actually feel like a star.

31:43.969 --> 31:44.835
I'm not nervous.
- Right.

31:44.837 --> 31:49.506
- But if you don't your A-plus,
plus, plus, plus game, poof.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.642
- I wasn't expecting them
to read so much into, like,

31:51.644 --> 31:53.810
the whole costuming
and outfits and everything.

31:53.812 --> 31:56.546
- All the things they said
of course made perfect sense,

31:56.548 --> 31:58.215
and I'm just like, fuck.

31:58.217 --> 32:01.985
- I honestly was not expecting
this, so it feels weird.

32:01.987 --> 32:06.189
- There is definitely a grim
undertone to our conversation,

32:06.191 --> 32:11.161
so I would not be surprised
if she chose me to go home.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.196
And I really want to stay.

32:13.899 --> 32:17.401
- It's so hard because
that's my best friend.

32:17.403 --> 32:21.104
- I know, but I feel like
if we continue to stay true

32:21.106 --> 32:23.607
to how we've been wanting to,
I think it's Katya.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.576
- Katya
had the most critiques.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.779
- Oh, God.

32:29.848 --> 32:32.816
- Katya, come on.

32:34.186 --> 32:34.985
My mind is racing.

32:34.987 --> 32:37.754
It's very easy for us to take
one critique and run with it.

32:37.756 --> 32:41.224
But there's so many factors
to take into consideration,

32:41.226 --> 32:42.526
so I'm conflicted.

32:42.528 --> 32:45.362
Do you feel if
I were to win the lip sync

32:45.364 --> 32:46.363
that I should save you?

32:46.365 --> 32:49.700
- I can't make that decision
for you.

32:50.369 --> 32:54.237
- In my opinion, I think
there's so much more to you

32:54.239 --> 32:55.339
than just one challenge

32:55.341 --> 32:57.641
or maybe one runway look
that didn't work.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.076
But do you think
falling short tonight

32:59.078 --> 33:01.578
should remove you
from this competition?

33:01.580 --> 33:04.581
- Um...

33:04.583 --> 33:07.551
- Katya's defeated
and you have to be confident.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.052
That's
the disheartened part.

33:09.054 --> 33:11.888
But I see the emotion
in her eyes.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.724
She wants to be here.

33:14.326 --> 33:18.128
- So do you think
that the girls in the top

33:18.130 --> 33:19.963
are going to stick
to our idea

33:19.965 --> 33:22.532
of what did the judges
have to say

33:22.534 --> 33:24.568
and that's who
we're going to choose?

33:24.570 --> 33:26.636
- I'm iffy of one of them.

33:26.638 --> 33:29.373
- Who? Which one?

33:29.942 --> 33:31.842
- I'll say it out loud.
I mean, no, no--

33:31.844 --> 33:33.410
- No, I know we're both
thinking the same person.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.112
- Because she's been vocal
about it.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.481
Like, it's not a secret.
Alyssa.

33:37.483 --> 33:39.016
- Yeah, Alyssa.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.250
- The one that I feel

33:40.252 --> 33:43.620
would play it the way that
we said we would is Detox.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.188
- Yeah.

33:46.091 --> 33:50.127
- If I were to win this
lip sync tonight, why you?

33:50.129 --> 33:53.263
- Well, on the personal side,
that's my best friend.

33:53.265 --> 33:53.830
- Mm-hmm.

33:53.832 --> 33:56.833
- I don't want to be responsible
for her going home.

33:56.835 --> 33:57.901
But if we're going to judge

33:57.903 --> 34:01.138
by the criteria
that we had all talked about,

34:01.140 --> 34:05.409
she got critiqued
on performance and on runway.

34:05.411 --> 34:06.676
I only got critiqued
on runway.

34:06.678 --> 34:10.981
I also want to say that
no matter which way it falls,

34:10.983 --> 34:12.249
I'll be all right with it.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.850
But I wish it was lip sync
for your life,

34:13.852 --> 34:16.286
because, baby, I've got
this fire in me right now.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.021
- That's what I wanted
to hear, bitch.

34:18.023 --> 34:19.656
- Alyssa looks in my eyes

34:19.658 --> 34:21.658
and says, that's
what I wanted to see.

34:21.660 --> 34:22.759
The fire and the passion.

34:22.761 --> 34:26.163
And from the moment Katya
got called into the bottom two,

34:26.165 --> 34:28.932
she resigned herself to the fact
that she's going home.

34:28.934 --> 34:31.334
She's not
putting forth a fight.

34:31.336 --> 34:32.135
- Do you know what?

34:32.137 --> 34:34.805
I think Ginger Minj
has a lot more fight

34:34.807 --> 34:36.273
to be in the competition,

34:36.275 --> 34:38.575
but Katya was just
in the top last week.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.143
She just won
the Snatch Game.

34:40.145 --> 34:42.746
And in the end, they both
have pros and cons.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.315
Oh, this is a tough decision
to make.

34:48.287 --> 34:50.353
- So I'm gonna tell you
what I said.

34:50.355 --> 34:50.887
- Okay.

34:50.889 --> 34:53.490
- Number one,
you're my best friend.

34:53.492 --> 34:54.057
- Mm-hmm.

34:54.059 --> 34:56.026
- But if you asked me my opinion
on what we all agreed on--

34:56.028 --> 34:56.993
- Yeah, yeah.

34:56.995 --> 34:58.128
I got the lowest points
tonight.

34:58.130 --> 35:02.365
I can't really delude myself in
the face of objective criteria.

35:02.367 --> 35:06.002
- Well, if this had worked
in my favor with the lighting,

35:06.004 --> 35:07.404
it'd be a different story,
but...

35:07.406 --> 35:08.572
- No, it's still ugly.

35:08.574 --> 35:12.275
(all laugh)

35:12.711 --> 35:15.912
- All right.
(blowing)

35:15.914 --> 35:17.013
Silence.

35:17.015 --> 35:22.419
Bring back my girls.
(blowing)

35:26.058 --> 35:28.125
- Although
it's a difficult feeling,

35:28.127 --> 35:30.627
it's not a difficult
decision to make.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.129
I feel confident
in my choice,

35:32.131 --> 35:35.599
and I'm gonna stick
by that decision.

35:35.601 --> 35:39.769
It's just a shitty decision
to have to make.

35:42.241 --> 35:45.242
- It's like
a never-ending walk

35:45.244 --> 35:48.578
because there's no win
in this situation.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.381
I'm gonna follow my heart
on this one.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.454
(RuPaul laughs)

35:58.257 --> 36:01.224
(RuPaul laughs)

36:04.596 --> 36:06.830
- Welcome back, ladies.

36:06.832 --> 36:10.800
Two top AllStars
stand before me.

36:10.802 --> 36:14.504
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

36:14.506 --> 36:19.442
win $10,000,
and earn the power

36:19.444 --> 36:23.647
to give one of
the bottom queens the chop.

36:24.750 --> 36:29.319
The time has come
for you to lip sync

36:29.321 --> 36:32.789
(echoing) for your legacy.

36:32.791 --> 36:35.825
- I'm very confident that I can
win the lip sync against Alyssa

36:35.827 --> 36:36.626
because I look amazing.

36:36.628 --> 36:39.729
I didn't have to change
to put on a fuckin show.

36:39.731 --> 36:43.867
- I am looking RuPaul
dead in the eyes.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.068
I'm in it to win it.

36:45.070 --> 36:49.739
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

36:49.741 --> 36:53.410
(music plays)

36:58.717 --> 37:03.153
¶ I feel the night explode ¶

37:03.155 --> 37:06.890
¶ When we're together ¶

37:06.892 --> 37:10.493
¶ Emotion overload ¶

37:10.495 --> 37:14.197
¶ In the heat of pleasure ¶

37:14.199 --> 37:19.236
¶ Take me, I'm yours,
into your arms ¶

37:19.238 --> 37:22.906
¶ Never let me go ¶

37:22.908 --> 37:29.980
¶ Tonight
I really need to know ¶

37:29.982 --> 37:31.815
¶ Tell it to my heart ¶

37:31.817 --> 37:34.117
¶ I can feel my body rock ¶

37:34.119 --> 37:39.289
¶ Every time
you call my name ¶

37:39.291 --> 37:43.827
¶ The passion's
so complete ¶

37:43.829 --> 37:47.631
¶ It's never ending ¶

37:47.633 --> 37:51.801
¶ As long as I receive ¶

37:51.803 --> 37:55.205
¶ The message
you're sending ¶

37:55.207 --> 37:58.475
¶ Love, love on the run ¶

37:58.477 --> 38:00.977
¶ Breaking us down ¶

38:00.979 --> 38:08.251
¶ No, I can't let you go ¶

38:08.253 --> 38:10.620
¶ Tell it to my heart ¶

38:10.622 --> 38:12.722
¶ Tell me I'm the only one ¶

38:12.724 --> 38:16.693
¶ Is this really love
or just a game? ¶

38:16.695 --> 38:18.295
¶ Tell it to my heart ¶

38:18.297 --> 38:21.331
¶ I can feel my body rock ¶

38:21.333 --> 38:24.301
¶ Every time
you call my name ¶

38:24.303 --> 38:26.503
- (laughs)

38:26.505 --> 38:28.071
- Word!

38:28.073 --> 38:32.375
- Ladies, I have made
my decision.

38:36.848 --> 38:41.251
Alyssa Edwards,
you're a winner, baby.

38:41.253 --> 38:46.389
You've earned a cash tip
of $10,000.

38:46.391 --> 38:47.624
- Whoo-hoo-hoo.

38:47.626 --> 38:50.026
Oh, my gosh.
You did it.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.961
Girl, you're leaving
your legacy.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.129
Thank you very much.

38:53.131 --> 38:56.299
- Detox, you're safe.

38:56.301 --> 38:57.434
- Thank you.

38:57.436 --> 38:58.535
Congratulations, girl.

38:58.537 --> 39:02.739
- Will the bottom two
please step forward.

39:07.446 --> 39:10.146
- Alyssa Edwards,
with great power

39:10.148 --> 39:12.682
comes great responsibility.

39:13.151 --> 39:18.621
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

39:18.623 --> 39:19.589
- I often tell my students

39:19.591 --> 39:23.193
that winning isn't everything,
but wanting to is.

39:23.195 --> 39:24.527
I chose the queen to stay

39:24.529 --> 39:26.830
based on when I looked
into her eyes,

39:26.832 --> 39:28.832
the conviction that I felt.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.367
Sometimes
being in the bottom

39:30.369 --> 39:34.204
could just be
a one-night kind of gig.

39:34.206 --> 39:37.874
So the queen
that I'm sending home...

39:40.312 --> 39:42.045
That's Ginger.

39:44.116 --> 39:48.651
- As it is written,
so it shall be done.

39:48.653 --> 39:52.055
Ginger Minj,
you are an AllStar.

39:52.057 --> 39:56.326
Now, sashay away.

39:59.197 --> 40:02.565
- I truly respect you
from the bottom of my heart.

40:03.702 --> 40:06.536
(applause)

40:06.538 --> 40:10.440
- They got me, gal.
(laughs)

40:10.442 --> 40:14.110
(all laugh)

40:14.112 --> 40:16.146
- Katya, I love you.

40:16.148 --> 40:18.348
You have a lot more to show.

40:20.118 --> 40:23.019
- I'm not surprised
that Alyssa sent me home.

40:23.021 --> 40:26.856
From day one, she's been gunning
to get rid of the competition,

40:26.858 --> 40:28.858
and I feel like
I was competition for her.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.727
She and I do
kind of the same thing.

40:30.729 --> 40:33.730
But I have no hard feelings
towards her.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.899
It's a gift that--
(alarm)

40:35.901 --> 40:38.234
- Ooh, girl.

40:38.236 --> 40:39.436
- What the hell?

40:39.438 --> 40:42.739
- RuPaul:
Ginger, not to worry.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.307
All is not lost.

40:44.309 --> 40:48.344
You still have a chance
to return

40:48.346 --> 40:51.915
for your revenge.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.016
- What?

40:53.018 --> 40:54.818
- (laughs)

40:56.521 --> 40:57.086
Revenge?

40:57.088 --> 41:01.057
I'm ready to knock Alyssa
out of this competition now.

41:01.059 --> 41:03.493
Let's do it.
