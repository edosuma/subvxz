00:12.355 --> 00:13.845
Right now...

00:13.923 --> 00:17.689
terrorists are plotting to assassinate
a presidential candidate.

00:18.127 --> 00:20.755
My wife and daughter are in danger

00:20.830 --> 00:24.630
and people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:25.401 --> 00:27.266
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.

00:27.670 --> 00:30.662
And this is the longest day of my life.

01:03.273 --> 01:05.468
I can go over your head, Mr. Almeida.

01:05.675 --> 01:08.339
And I assure you,
there will be consequences.

01:08.413 --> 01:11.247
I apologize, Senator,
but we do have protocol.

01:11.317 --> 01:14.445
Our district director, Ryan Chappelle,
Is working on a clearance.

01:14.520 --> 01:17.753
- But if I could tell him why you're here...
- All he needs to know...

01:18.026 --> 01:21.622
...is that I need to talk to Jack Bauer,
and I need to do it now.

01:23.766 --> 01:25.793
- Can I get you anything while...
- No.

01:47.197 --> 01:48.391
Chappelle.

01:48.465 --> 01:51.129
Yeah, I don't think I can stall
the Senator much longer.

01:51.203 --> 01:53.034
He wants to know why he can't see Jack.

01:53.105 --> 01:54.937
What did you tell him?

01:56.409 --> 01:58.503
I told him you were working on it.

01:58.879 --> 02:03.340
- He still didn't say why he was here?
- No, he just wants to see Jack.

02:03.418 --> 02:06.947
Until I know more
I don't want to put those two together.

02:07.024 --> 02:09.015
I'm checking it out now.

02:09.094 --> 02:10.589
All right.

02:14.662 --> 02:15.822
So?

02:16.564 --> 02:19.056
- Find out what Palmer's doing here?
- Not yet.

02:19.134 --> 02:21.602
Any new Intel on the backup shooters?

02:21.903 --> 02:24.169
Yeah. An Alexis Drazen.

02:24.241 --> 02:27.733
Looks like he's connected to two
other shooters, but he stopped In DC...

02:27.811 --> 02:30.838
...for a couple of days
before landing in LAX on Saturday.

02:30.916 --> 02:33.613
There's other inconsistencies.
I'm still working on it.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.922
- Where's the report?
- I routed it to Nina's computer.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.590
- Send me a copy, would you?
- Yeah.

02:44.401 --> 02:47.336
I still don't understand why
you're taking us to a safe house.

02:47.404 --> 02:50.170
Weren't we supposed to answer
questions at Jack's office?

02:50.242 --> 02:52.301
We're going to do that
at the safe house, now.

02:52.377 --> 02:54.073
Is my dad going to be there?

02:54.347 --> 02:57.512
Not right away.
Maybe when he's done at CTU.

02:59.754 --> 03:01.415
Are we okay, Nina?

03:01.689 --> 03:02.884
Everything's fine.

03:02.958 --> 03:06.486
A small, controlled environment
is the most secure place for both of you.

03:06.563 --> 03:10.125
- Does Jack know you're taking us?
- Of course. Myers.

03:10.668 --> 03:14.367
We're moving Teri and Kim to the
safe house now. We should be there soon.

03:14.474 --> 03:18.411
Mom, you never told me
what the doctor said.

03:21.450 --> 03:23.715
It was a cyst that burst.

03:24.053 --> 03:26.146
She said it wasn't serious.

03:28.492 --> 03:31.361
- Then why did she...
- Honey, there's nothing to worry about.

03:31.964 --> 03:34.125
She said it would go away all by itself.

03:39.273 --> 03:41.742
Gaines first made contact
with me on my cell phone.

03:41.810 --> 03:44.472
He directed me to a car in
a parking lot of St. Mark's.

03:44.546 --> 03:46.209
The transmitter was in the car?

03:46.484 --> 03:49.044
Yeah, that's when he asked me
to put it in my ear.

03:50.454 --> 03:52.582
Can we take a break for a second?

03:53.058 --> 03:56.052
Could you find out for me how
my wife and daughter are doing?

03:56.129 --> 03:58.097
Teri and Kim have already left the clinic.

03:58.165 --> 03:59.189
What?

03:59.266 --> 04:02.168
They're fine.
Nina's moving them to a safe house.

04:02.237 --> 04:05.173
You knew they were moving my family
and you didn't tell me?

04:06.176 --> 04:08.736
That's it. This is over.

04:08.812 --> 04:11.942
I don't say another word.
I want to speak to Chappelle.

04:14.152 --> 04:15.620
Now, Alberta!

04:26.335 --> 04:27.495
You're exhausting.

04:29.273 --> 04:31.674
I was surprised you called last night.

04:32.076 --> 04:35.513
I didn't think I'd see you again after DC.

04:37.384 --> 04:39.979
I'm not really that easy, you know.

04:41.622 --> 04:44.684
Will you have another break
later in the day?

04:51.802 --> 04:54.671
The Senator has to leave town
this afternoon.

04:54.740 --> 04:57.868
He's going to Nevada.

04:58.277 --> 05:00.075
Only a few of us were told about it...

05:00.147 --> 05:04.609
...and I am one of the ones
who has to go with him.

05:05.087 --> 05:08.113
- You have to hold his hand?
- In so many words.

05:11.462 --> 05:15.900
Is it too much to hope that you
might have some free time in Nevada?

05:16.535 --> 05:18.094
You would want to come?

05:18.772 --> 05:20.296
If you want me.

05:40.100 --> 05:43.765
You know, this is a pretty
big shower. There's room enough for two.

05:43.839 --> 05:45.329
I'm on my way.

05:47.209 --> 05:50.111
- Alan.
- What can I do for you?

05:50.179 --> 05:53.048
I'm trying to talk to
a CTU agent named Jack Bauer.

05:53.118 --> 05:55.279
- Where are you?
- CTU Los Angeles.

05:55.854 --> 05:58.983
They say I need clearance,
but it's taking forever.

05:59.058 --> 06:01.459
Not a problem.
Who's In charge over there?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.053
Ryan Chappelle.

06:03.164 --> 06:06.258
Yeah, okay.
I'll take care of this right away.

06:06.334 --> 06:07.563
Thank you, Alan.

06:07.704 --> 06:09.035
I owe you.

06:12.143 --> 06:13.576
Senator Palmer.

06:14.245 --> 06:15.405
Ryan Chappelle.

06:16.214 --> 06:18.240
What seems to be the problem, Ryan?

06:18.317 --> 06:20.285
Why can't I get in to see Agent Bauer?

06:20.353 --> 06:22.015
Please forgive the wait.

06:22.089 --> 06:24.353
When an agent is under
internal investigation...

06:24.426 --> 06:28.090
...procedure is to keep him isolated
until he's been fully interrogated.

06:28.164 --> 06:31.157
It's really out of my hands.

06:31.234 --> 06:33.703
Even if I could help you
with your investigation?

06:33.805 --> 06:35.295
Mr. Chappelle.

06:35.707 --> 06:38.506
Alan Optican from the Pentagon
is on the line for you.

06:39.344 --> 06:40.676
Excuse me.

06:42.116 --> 06:43.140
Chappelle.

06:43.217 --> 06:45.185
Alan Optican, Department of Defense.

06:45.252 --> 06:46.151
Yes, sir.

06:46.221 --> 06:49.281
From now on, the Senator is to
be given carte blanche.

06:49.357 --> 06:51.156
You make sure he gets whatever he needs.

06:51.228 --> 06:52.092
Yes, sir.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.390
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

06:53.464 --> 06:54.761
Thank you.

06:55.233 --> 06:57.964
Bring Jack Bauer down here right away.

07:05.179 --> 07:06.408
Thanks...

07:06.582 --> 07:10.280
...for helping me cut through the red tape.

07:12.222 --> 07:15.489
I want all your cameras
and recording equipment shut down.

07:17.295 --> 07:19.992
This is going to be a private conversation.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.866
I understand.

07:22.268 --> 07:24.397
I'll make sure the room is secure.

07:24.506 --> 07:25.837
Thank you.

07:30.546 --> 07:32.174
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey.

07:32.382 --> 07:35.784
Nina called, wanted me to tell you
Teri and Kim are fine.

07:37.255 --> 07:40.158
- Who's guarding the house?
- Paulson and Breeher.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.523
Okay, good.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.894
Also, Chappelle wants to see you
in the conference room.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.224
Good.

07:49.772 --> 07:51.501
Thanks a lot, Tony.

07:58.717 --> 08:01.811
Milo, sorry I had to switch
the cards on you last night.

08:01.887 --> 08:03.149
I had no choice.

08:03.223 --> 08:05.988
No problem. We understand what
you were going through.

08:06.060 --> 08:07.288
Thanks for your help.

08:17.876 --> 08:19.468
Senator Palmer.

08:20.111 --> 08:21.374
Leave us.

08:24.484 --> 08:26.543
- I'll be outside.
- Thank you.

08:26.620 --> 08:28.145
Close the door.

08:30.025 --> 08:31.083
Sit.

08:31.560 --> 08:32.823
Yes, sir.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.635
I want to know
who's working with you.

08:39.136 --> 08:43.006
- In which context, sir?
- Right here, right now.

08:43.076 --> 08:44.407
We're going to end this.

08:44.477 --> 08:45.876
I don't know what
they told you...

08:45.945 --> 08:47.710
I know why you want me dead.

08:47.782 --> 08:49.773
I don't know what you're talking about.

08:49.851 --> 08:51.045
Kosovo.

08:53.189 --> 08:54.315
Kosovo?

08:54.390 --> 08:57.225
I know you hold me responsible
for the men you lost there.

08:57.695 --> 08:59.492
Two years ago today.

09:00.031 --> 09:02.091
You know about Operation Nightfall?

09:02.334 --> 09:04.235
I authorized the mission.

09:05.138 --> 09:08.374
- I know you took out
- Drazen and his inner circle.

09:08.508 --> 09:10.408
I know you lost six men in the process.

09:10.476 --> 09:13.242
- You think I want revenge?
- Yes, I do.

09:13.314 --> 09:16.978
With all due respect,
I almost died today trying to protect you.

09:17.052 --> 09:20.648
If I blame anyone for the death of my
men In Kosovo, sir, I blame myself.

09:20.724 --> 09:23.592
- What were you doing at the power plant?
- I was trying...

09:27.934 --> 09:30.768
The reason why I went for that
Secret Service agent's gun...

09:30.838 --> 09:34.171
...was to try and get you out of the room
without giving myself away.

09:36.111 --> 09:39.104
The people that want you dead,
they had kidnapped my family.

09:39.182 --> 09:43.210
They threatened to kill them if I didn't
assist them in the assassination attempt.

09:46.859 --> 09:50.227
They didn't tell you any of this
when you came in, did they, sir?

09:51.298 --> 09:52.322
No.

10:03.547 --> 10:05.072
It's the truth.

10:05.283 --> 10:07.717
You can verify it with Chappelle.

10:27.846 --> 10:30.179
They're just arriving
at the safe house.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.877
Copy that.

10:42.164 --> 10:44.066
This way Mrs. Bauer.

10:45.336 --> 10:47.896
These are agents
Ted Paulson and Jeff Breeher.

10:47.972 --> 10:51.136
They've worked with Jack for many years.
They're two of our best.

10:51.210 --> 10:53.612
This is Jack's wife, Teri,
and their daughter Kim.

10:53.681 --> 10:55.273
- Hi.
- Hi, Kim.

10:55.983 --> 10:57.109
Where do you want us?

10:57.184 --> 10:58.914
One in and one out.

11:11.037 --> 11:14.667
It's not exactly home,
but it's relatively comfortable.

11:22.952 --> 11:25.421
There are motion detectors
every ten yards.

11:26.090 --> 11:27.558
How long do we have to stay here?

11:27.626 --> 11:30.595
We'll worry about that after we finish
debriefing you.

11:31.263 --> 11:32.731
Nina, where's the bathroom?

11:32.799 --> 11:35.701
There's one in each bedroom,
right through there.

11:35.969 --> 11:39.428
If you'd both like to clean up
before we get started, please do.

12:26.137 --> 12:30.404
I was the head of the Special Defense
Appropriations Committee in the Senate.

12:31.143 --> 12:34.341
Which is just a euphemism
for "covert operations."

12:34.414 --> 12:37.213
Three years ago,
the CIA brought to my attention...

12:37.284 --> 12:41.052
...atrocities committed
by Victor Drazen In Kosovo.

12:41.223 --> 12:45.058
Massacres, torture, ethnic cleansing.

12:45.128 --> 12:46.959
The man was a monster.

12:47.230 --> 12:49.062
And was gaining support.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.192
I tried to go through the usual channels...

12:51.270 --> 12:53.864
...but I couldn't get anyone
to work quickly enough.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.203
So I contacted the one person I knew...

12:57.278 --> 12:58.939
...who could get the job done.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.015
Have him terminated, off the books.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.846
And that would be Robert Ellis?

13:04.052 --> 13:05.521
That's right.

13:07.257 --> 13:10.557
Ellis was funded through a
discretionary fund of my committee.

13:10.628 --> 13:13.154
His job was to implement
the covert missions...

13:13.232 --> 13:15.599
...and see to It that no names were leaked.

13:17.137 --> 13:19.663
Now we're both on somebody's list.

13:22.211 --> 13:25.113
So this is payback
for what happened that day.

13:25.782 --> 13:27.909
That's the only thing that makes sense.

13:28.318 --> 13:31.653
But if someone could put your name
and my name on a list together...

13:31.790 --> 13:34.783
...that means they should be able
to find Robert Ellis, too.

13:36.028 --> 13:37.086
You're right.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.605
Four sixes.

13:49.113 --> 13:50.637
Let's see 'em.

13:54.888 --> 13:57.881
I knew it. I saw it in your eyes.

13:58.692 --> 14:01.957
If you could read what's in my eyes
you'd crawl under a rock and cry.

14:08.405 --> 14:09.929
Go again.

14:17.250 --> 14:20.220
- Ellis.
- Bobby, this Is David Palmer.

14:20.488 --> 14:21.750
You've got to be kidding.

14:21.823 --> 14:24.621
I'm not. I'm here with Jack Bauer.

14:26.629 --> 14:27.891
Get lost.

14:30.901 --> 14:33.132
What are you doing
in the same room with Bauer?

14:33.204 --> 14:36.298
I went to a lot of trouble to make sure
you two never met.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.743
Someone close to Victor Drazen
seems to have connected us.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.340
Explain.

14:41.649 --> 14:46.315
Someone wants me dead, and it appears
they want Bauer, too. Today.

14:46.389 --> 14:48.983
The two-year anniversary of Nightfall.

14:49.059 --> 14:52.587
I'm the only one who even knows
you both were involved in Nightfall.

14:52.663 --> 14:53.892
Apparently not.

14:53.966 --> 14:56.663
And if we're on the list,
it's likely you are, too.

14:56.970 --> 14:59.837
- Let me talk to Bauer.
- I'm right here, Bob.

14:59.906 --> 15:00.999
Jack.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.507
- You still at CTU?
- Yeah.

15:03.578 --> 15:06.104
To source this,
we'll need each other's help.

15:06.182 --> 15:10.142
Unfortunately, over the last 12 hours
I've had to cut a few corners.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.917
I'm being investigated right now.
My hands are tied.

15:12.991 --> 15:16.257
Get them untied.
David can help you there.

15:16.328 --> 15:19.924
If this is about revenge, it has to be
someone connected to your team...

15:20.000 --> 15:20.990
No, that's not possible.

15:21.068 --> 15:23.434
No one on my team knew
of the Senator's involvement.

15:23.504 --> 15:25.666
Then it has to be Drazen's group.

15:25.741 --> 15:28.336
I'll retrieve the closed file on Nightfall.

15:28.711 --> 15:31.681
It'll contain the names
of Drazen's associates.

15:31.749 --> 15:33.080
That'll take a few minutes.

15:33.150 --> 15:35.882
In the meantime,
you need to pick up a trail on the money.

15:35.955 --> 15:38.185
Odds are it's funded through Belgium.

15:38.257 --> 15:40.021
Can you get to your K-3
accounts from there?

15:40.093 --> 15:41.958
Yes, if I get reinstated.

15:42.029 --> 15:43.759
All right, start there.

15:44.566 --> 15:47.899
We'll compare names when
we talk again. Where can I reach you?

15:47.970 --> 15:49.996
CTU, Los Angeles office.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.672
All right.

16:39.597 --> 16:41.064
Teri?

16:42.067 --> 16:43.035
Yes?

16:43.336 --> 16:45.497
I put some clean clothes on the bed.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.671
Thank you.

16:59.624 --> 17:02.116
They called me in
and said you decided not to fly out.

17:02.194 --> 17:03.991
What happened?
Aren't we going to Nevada?

17:04.063 --> 17:07.262
Apparently not, the Senator
needed to take care of something first.

17:07.335 --> 17:08.700
He thought we'd be safest here.

17:08.769 --> 17:11.796
- Are you going to take a later flight?
- I don't know. I hope so.

17:11.874 --> 17:14.672
Call the Times,
tell them I'll do that phoner, 45 minutes.

17:14.742 --> 17:15.836
Sure.

17:33.569 --> 17:34.627
Hello.

17:34.703 --> 17:36.763
- You miss me yet?
- Of course.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.865
I hope you didn't book
your flight to Nevada.

17:38.942 --> 17:40.969
I was just about to.

17:41.413 --> 17:42.471
Why?

17:42.748 --> 17:44.613
We might not be going.

17:45.350 --> 17:47.080
When will you know?

17:47.187 --> 17:48.678
About an hour.

17:50.057 --> 17:53.050
If you stay in town,
will you remain at the hotel?

17:53.128 --> 17:56.793
I don't know, they might switch us at
the last minute for security reasons.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.597
Either way, I'll let you know where I am.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.769
I can still smell your perfume
on my skin.

18:04.008 --> 18:07.070
I'll call you as soon as I know.

18:08.982 --> 18:10.848
- Is that the girl?
- Yes.

18:11.986 --> 18:14.046
Palmer might not be leaving after all.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.448
Better for us.

18:17.961 --> 18:20.726
Was there any problem getting rid
of Gaines' people?

18:20.864 --> 18:21.889
No.

18:23.535 --> 18:27.438
You should never have used him.
I told you it was a mistake.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.033
Fine. You fixed the mistake.

18:30.111 --> 18:31.578
Let's move on.

18:39.957 --> 18:42.050
She looks like Martina.

18:45.764 --> 18:48.165
Our sister is dead, Andre.

18:48.769 --> 18:50.293
Leave It alone.

18:55.177 --> 18:59.615
- Have you spoken to Jovan and Mishko?
- They have their targets in sight.

19:00.517 --> 19:02.678
And as for Palmer...

19:02.753 --> 19:06.020
...I give you my word,
he will be dead by midnight.

19:14.202 --> 19:18.196
- Do you have any toothpaste?
- Yeah, honey, it's right there.

19:28.154 --> 19:32.216
That's nothing. The doctor just wanted me
to take it as a precaution.

19:39.469 --> 19:40.959
You scared me.

19:41.805 --> 19:42.864
Kim?

19:43.574 --> 19:44.666
What?

19:49.182 --> 19:50.774
You're pregnant.

19:56.792 --> 19:58.089
I don't understand.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.628
What happened to you today?
How is that possible?

20:00.696 --> 20:04.099
No, it was Dad, of course, but,
with tests like this, it takes time...

20:04.168 --> 20:06.865
You were trying to have a kid
and you didn't tell me?

20:06.939 --> 20:08.998
No, honey, it wasn't like that.

20:09.508 --> 20:10.669
Kim.

20:12.179 --> 20:13.669
- What?
- Please.

20:14.115 --> 20:16.949
This is just as much a shock
to me as it is to you.

20:17.652 --> 20:21.886
Dad and I used birth control.
It's protection, but It's never 100 percent.

20:21.959 --> 20:24.325
It's your life.
You don't need my permission.

20:24.395 --> 20:27.298
I'm not asking for your permission.

20:29.001 --> 20:33.268
Once in a while, you have to think about
what another person is going through.

20:34.408 --> 20:37.038
Honey, I just found out I'm pregnant.

20:39.448 --> 20:41.940
You don't think that terrifies me?

20:44.255 --> 20:45.746
It does.

20:51.130 --> 20:54.066
Mom, I'm sorry.

21:05.316 --> 21:08.809
Are there any other names on
the HK list that you recognize, David?

21:08.887 --> 21:11.322
Rich Dolan, Michael Redman. That's it.

21:11.391 --> 21:14.087
- They weren't cleared till after the op.
- Come on in.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.788
I'll use what we have so far.

21:15.863 --> 21:18.594
I shouldn't be here.
Green's got me on priority.

21:18.667 --> 21:19.760
I cleared it.

21:19.836 --> 21:22.634
- Okay, Bob, he's here.
- Milo.

21:22.705 --> 21:24.731
Yeah. Who are you?

21:24.808 --> 21:29.338
Don't worry about me.
I see you opened some sockets up to MI5.

21:29.748 --> 21:32.239
- Yeah, how did you know that?
- Doesn't matter.

21:32.318 --> 21:35.687
Right now, we're trying to hook up
some names. I'm going to help you.

21:35.756 --> 21:38.350
What's your login ID and password?

21:38.827 --> 21:40.317
Give it to him.

21:42.599 --> 21:45.125
The login ID is "L-F-N."

21:45.669 --> 21:49.970
Password's "foothill 94022." Lower case.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.268
Okay, hang on.

21:55.115 --> 21:58.142
Okay. Looks like we've got
some partial results.

21:58.219 --> 21:59.209
Partial?

21:59.288 --> 22:01.984
Yeah. Looks like
there's something missing here.

22:02.191 --> 22:03.420
What do you mean, Bob?

22:07.398 --> 22:09.390
Something's been removed.

22:09.835 --> 22:11.268
I'll look into it.

22:12.137 --> 22:14.538
Meanwhile, Milo, I'm going to...

22:15.476 --> 22:17.707
I'm going to send a file to your server.

22:19.047 --> 22:22.244
Why don't you print out hard copies
for Jack and David?

22:23.052 --> 22:25.749
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Milo.

22:40.074 --> 22:41.839
All right, here we go.

22:44.514 --> 22:46.676
Feels like I haven't eaten in years.

22:52.291 --> 22:53.815
Feels good, doesn't it?

22:53.926 --> 22:55.951
Not being afraid anymore.

22:56.262 --> 22:57.356
Yeah.

23:00.802 --> 23:04.000
I'm sorry, Mom.
I was being really stupid before.

23:06.577 --> 23:08.738
When are you going to tell Dad?

23:13.385 --> 23:14.876
You know what?

23:16.690 --> 23:18.130
Right now.

23:18.669 --> 23:19.829
Come on.

23:34.757 --> 23:35.918
CTU, Almeida.

23:35.993 --> 23:39.259
Hi, Tony, it's Teri Bauer calling.
Could I talk to Jack, please?

23:39.330 --> 23:43.199
Hi, Teri. Actually, it's a bad time.
He's kind of busy right now.

23:43.268 --> 23:46.830
Could you tell him to call me back?
It's important.

23:47.041 --> 23:48.133
Sure.

23:50.746 --> 23:52.976
I really wanted to hear his reaction.

23:54.016 --> 23:57.010
I'm so lucky to have you. Baby.

24:05.032 --> 24:08.195
Hi. Sorry,
but we really need to start the debrief.

24:08.268 --> 24:09.964
CTU's eager to find out what you know.

24:10.038 --> 24:11.801
- We're ready.
- Yeah.

24:11.873 --> 24:14.207
Great. I'd like to start with
just you, Teri.

24:14.377 --> 24:15.469
Fine.

24:19.717 --> 24:21.310
I think I'm going to go to my room.

24:21.386 --> 24:24.288
That's a good idea, honey.
You should try and get some rest.

24:27.393 --> 24:31.058
This is standard procedure.
We're going to put you on videotape.

24:31.132 --> 24:32.360
Okay.

25:02.708 --> 25:04.903
- Yeah.
- Hi, Rick?

25:05.311 --> 25:07.245
Hey, Kim.

25:07.447 --> 25:08.709
Are you okay?

25:08.782 --> 25:11.217
Yeah. I just lost a little blood.

25:11.452 --> 25:13.921
You need to see a doctor.
You don't sound good.

25:14.656 --> 25:16.521
I need a few days' rest, that's all.

25:16.592 --> 25:19.358
You should turn yourself in.
You can get medical attention.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.364
I can also get arrested.

25:21.866 --> 25:24.165
You helped us escape. I'll tell them that.

25:24.236 --> 25:25.498
No!

25:27.441 --> 25:29.466
Don't tell them anything about me.

25:30.377 --> 25:31.936
It's too late.

25:32.013 --> 25:35.141
My mom's already being questioned.
They're going to ask about you.

25:35.216 --> 25:37.083
I'm next. I can't lie.

25:37.687 --> 25:38.813
Okay.

25:39.189 --> 25:40.383
Don't.

25:42.393 --> 25:45.693
Just tell them that I didn't know anything
about what was going on...

25:45.764 --> 25:48.131
...and that Dan threatened me.
He had a gun.

25:50.570 --> 25:53.632
Okay, but promise me
you'll turn yourself in.

25:54.810 --> 25:57.837
I got to think this through.
I'm not like you, Kim.

25:57.914 --> 26:01.443
I don't come from a good family.
System's not going to give me a break.

26:01.719 --> 26:04.210
It's your only way out of this.

26:04.823 --> 26:06.519
I brought you to Gaines.

26:06.926 --> 26:08.393
That's kidnapping.

26:08.762 --> 26:11.630
They could put me in jail
for the rest of my life.

26:23.881 --> 26:28.684
What's incredible is that this has nothing
to do with me running for president.

26:30.157 --> 26:32.489
It has nothing to do with...

26:33.026 --> 26:34.426
...the primary.

26:36.765 --> 26:39.929
It has nothing to do with my being black.

26:43.674 --> 26:47.270
It's just revenge for taking out
Victor Drazen.

26:49.315 --> 26:50.373
Yes.

26:56.157 --> 26:58.455
- Hello?
- David, It's Sherry.

26:58.526 --> 27:00.519
Hi. Are you back at the hotel?

27:00.597 --> 27:04.295
- Yes. Where are you?
- I'm at CTU, a government agency.

27:04.535 --> 27:05.593
Why?

27:07.106 --> 27:09.302
There are some things
I have to take care of.

27:09.376 --> 27:11.674
David, what's going on?

27:12.913 --> 27:16.851
I'm trying to find out
who's attempting to kill me, Sherry.

27:16.919 --> 27:20.083
I've got to go.
Just wait for me at the hotel, okay?

27:20.156 --> 27:21.521
- Okay.
- Bye.

27:28.567 --> 27:30.262
It just doesn't stop.

27:33.241 --> 27:35.971
I'm sorry this is happening to you, sir.

27:39.515 --> 27:41.313
You've been detained.

27:42.052 --> 27:44.180
Your family's been kidnapped...

27:44.522 --> 27:46.854
...and you're concerned about me?

27:50.496 --> 27:53.091
That didn't have anything to do
with the election.

27:54.168 --> 27:55.658
That was about my son.

27:56.303 --> 27:57.966
Is he okay?

27:59.008 --> 28:00.805
I just realized today...

28:02.112 --> 28:05.013
...that I haven't always been there for him.

28:07.052 --> 28:08.952
And what's killing me...

28:11.123 --> 28:13.855
...is that he's always been there for me.

28:18.633 --> 28:21.101
Being the son of a politician isn't easy.

28:23.574 --> 28:26.408
Being a son, or a daughter...

28:27.712 --> 28:29.202
...or a father...

28:30.281 --> 28:32.148
...none of it's easy.

28:37.625 --> 28:39.560
Your wife and daughter okay?

28:41.965 --> 28:43.432
I don't know.

28:46.003 --> 28:47.335
I hope so.

28:58.186 --> 29:02.283
Okay. Try to be relaxed.
I just have a few questions.

29:04.027 --> 29:07.486
This just came in from Ellis.
I organized it into three sections.

29:07.565 --> 29:11.832
Cross-references are In the first part.
Then, a summary of Operation Nightfall.

29:11.904 --> 29:14.897
Details that may or may not be important,
I put in the last part.

29:14.975 --> 29:17.569
- Any word on the missing file?
- No, not yet.

29:17.645 --> 29:19.374
Okay, thanks, Milo.

29:24.487 --> 29:27.184
What is the ambassador
to Libya doing on this list?

29:27.257 --> 29:30.285
Probably helped keep Drazen's
money separate from the government.

29:30.362 --> 29:32.887
We've had our eye on him
for quite some time.

29:34.133 --> 29:36.364
Do you know René Bonniére?

29:36.837 --> 29:39.273
- No. Who's he?
- He's out of North Africa.

29:39.341 --> 29:43.539
Some higher-ups at District thought he was
trying to set up terrorist cells in the U.S.

29:54.495 --> 29:56.759
Jack. Page 4.

29:57.131 --> 29:59.032
Second paragraph down.

30:06.574 --> 30:09.043
Drazen's wife and daughter
were in the bunker?

30:09.244 --> 30:10.735
Did you know about this?

30:11.314 --> 30:13.340
This wasn't In our Initial report.

30:13.417 --> 30:15.510
They died in the explosion.

30:16.020 --> 30:17.510
My God.

30:18.958 --> 30:20.983
This is an eye for an eye.

30:21.494 --> 30:23.656
We took out Drazen and his family...

30:23.730 --> 30:25.561
...and now someone wants mine.

30:26.066 --> 30:28.536
Who's in charge of protecting your family?

30:29.905 --> 30:30.997
Jack!

30:31.373 --> 30:34.275
Who has the authority to add security
to your family?

30:34.344 --> 30:35.276
Chappelle.

30:36.981 --> 30:39.974
- Yes, Senator?
- Send in Mr. Chappelle right away.

30:40.052 --> 30:41.110
Yes, sir.

30:42.622 --> 30:44.454
So there was nothing else
you saw or heard...

30:44.525 --> 30:46.789
...that gave you a glimpse
Into their operation?

30:46.861 --> 30:48.352
No. That's it.

30:48.830 --> 30:50.991
They really didn't talk much in front of us.

30:51.333 --> 30:53.826
Tell me about Rick.
You said he helped you?

30:53.904 --> 30:55.269
- Yeah.
- How?

30:55.873 --> 31:00.368
Different ways. But mainly, he gave us
a gun and he helped us escape.

31:00.980 --> 31:02.278
How'd he get a gun?

31:02.949 --> 31:04.246
I don't know.

31:04.551 --> 31:06.782
- You don't know his last name?
- No.

31:06.854 --> 31:09.449
I don't think Kimberly does, either,
but you can ask her.

31:09.525 --> 31:11.049
How did she meet him?

31:11.293 --> 31:13.694
Through her friend Janet York.

31:16.867 --> 31:19.837
Everyone used to tell me,
"Wait until she's a teenager.

31:19.905 --> 31:23.103
"You'll finally understand the meaning
of the word 'worry."'

31:23.943 --> 31:25.570
I'm sure she'll grow out of it.

31:25.646 --> 31:28.411
Jack says she's basically
a level-headed kid.

31:28.883 --> 31:30.578
Jack talks about Kim?

31:30.986 --> 31:32.977
Just the usual stuff.

31:34.057 --> 31:35.719
That surprises me.

31:36.494 --> 31:39.088
Jack's work always seems
so serious and secretive.

31:39.163 --> 31:42.965
It's hard to picture him sitting around
the office talking about his family.

31:43.803 --> 31:45.293
Sometimes...

31:45.371 --> 31:49.365
...at lunch, he'll bring up something
if something's on his mind.

31:52.615 --> 31:55.949
Do you think Rick had
the confidence of Ira Gaines...

31:56.019 --> 31:57.748
...the leader of the group?

31:58.355 --> 32:00.348
I really couldn't tell you that.

32:01.594 --> 32:03.562
Nina, could I ask you a question?

32:03.862 --> 32:04.955
Sure.

32:05.665 --> 32:08.157
When Jack and I were separated...

32:11.640 --> 32:13.733
...did he ever talk about me?

32:17.147 --> 32:19.776
Jack never discussed his marriage.

32:19.851 --> 32:20.875
Oh.

32:21.453 --> 32:24.583
Sometimes he would talk about Kim.

32:24.658 --> 32:25.920
You know.

32:32.100 --> 32:35.731
We all knew he was going
through a very hard time...

32:36.039 --> 32:38.735
...and that he missed you both very much.

32:44.617 --> 32:47.552
When Jack and I got back together again...

32:48.454 --> 32:51.357
...he told me that he'd been
with someone else.

32:55.531 --> 32:59.299
I told him it didn't matter
what I did, what he did...

32:59.637 --> 33:01.696
...when we were apart,
that was in the past...

33:01.773 --> 33:05.608
...that the only thing that mattered
was what we did from that point on.

33:13.655 --> 33:15.521
It was you, wasn't it?

33:18.529 --> 33:19.723
Teri.

33:23.569 --> 33:27.438
I saw it when we got off the helicopter.

33:28.542 --> 33:30.977
I saw it when you looked at him.

33:44.596 --> 33:46.689
After you were separated...

33:47.735 --> 33:49.635
Yes, we saw each other.

33:50.671 --> 33:52.230
But it didn't last long.

33:52.307 --> 33:54.741
He realized it was a mistake
and he went back to you.

33:56.112 --> 33:57.603
What about you?

33:58.215 --> 33:59.705
What about me?

34:00.484 --> 34:02.817
Did you think it was a mistake?

34:06.826 --> 34:09.386
- Are you still sleeping with him?
- No.

34:10.295 --> 34:11.286
Teri.

34:11.931 --> 34:15.960
It was over before he went back to you.
That is the truth.

34:21.279 --> 34:24.578
I realize this is a terrible time
for you to discover all this.

34:25.550 --> 34:28.281
When do you think
a good time would be, Nina?

34:30.757 --> 34:32.089
I'm sorry.

34:33.661 --> 34:36.563
We have to get through the rest of this.

34:36.632 --> 34:38.862
I need to take a break.

34:55.623 --> 34:57.182
Yeah, Mike, I know.

34:57.760 --> 35:00.059
We'll be leaving in about five minutes.

35:01.865 --> 35:04.665
I can't wait for Ellis to get back to us,
so I've got to go.

35:04.736 --> 35:07.102
They won't let me
continue to work here.

35:07.172 --> 35:09.266
I'm technically still under arrest.

35:10.610 --> 35:11.703
Come on.

35:13.781 --> 35:15.306
Ryan.

35:17.085 --> 35:18.552
Yes, Senator?

35:18.653 --> 35:20.486
I understand you have Jack under arrest.

35:20.557 --> 35:23.151
I told him I was being detained
for questioning.

35:23.227 --> 35:24.957
There's an ongoing crisis...

35:25.029 --> 35:28.261
...that supersedes any charges
that might be filed against him.

35:29.369 --> 35:30.427
But, Senator...

35:30.503 --> 35:33.370
I want him reinstated to his
previous position, effective now.

35:33.440 --> 35:36.468
Sorry, but you don't have
the authority to make that decision.

35:36.545 --> 35:38.137
Alberta, please.

35:39.015 --> 35:40.414
Sir...

35:40.550 --> 35:42.814
...what you are asking isn't possible.

35:42.886 --> 35:45.448
The charges against
Agent Bauer are serious.

35:45.523 --> 35:48.459
We would be held In contempt
of agency regulations...

35:48.527 --> 35:50.461
...if we reinstated him without a hearing.

35:50.529 --> 35:54.262
Ryan, you don't have to reinstate me.
Not permanently.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.930
Nobody here has as much
information about this situation as I do.

35:58.007 --> 36:00.909
Give me provisional status
just till the end of the day.

36:00.977 --> 36:03.879
Then you can take me back into custody,
do whatever you want.

36:12.559 --> 36:14.151
Fine, Jack.

36:14.762 --> 36:18.359
You work the case out of CTU,
but you answer to me.

36:21.504 --> 36:23.735
Good luck with your campaign, Senator.

36:24.441 --> 36:25.772
Thank you.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.947
Walk with me.

36:34.622 --> 36:37.023
Secret Service wants me
to leave the state.

36:37.659 --> 36:40.594
- They say it's not safe.
- I agree with them.

36:42.332 --> 36:45.996
The one thing we know is
that Drazen's people are here...

36:46.070 --> 36:49.905
...and they want us today.
And it's almost 3:00 now.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.945
The day Is more than half over.

36:52.279 --> 36:53.940
I'm going to stay.

36:54.414 --> 36:57.111
Let's flush them out into the open
and deal with them.

36:57.752 --> 37:00.221
Otherwise, you and I and our families...

37:00.289 --> 37:03.350
...will be looking over our shoulders
for the rest of our lives.

37:03.927 --> 37:05.189
I understand.

37:05.662 --> 37:09.598
I'll follow up with Ellis. I'll keep you posted.
You know how to get in touch with me.

37:09.865 --> 37:10.958
Jack.

37:13.069 --> 37:14.900
I'm sorry that I misjudged you.

37:20.413 --> 37:21.971
Thank you, Senator.

37:25.320 --> 37:26.514
Excuse me.

37:31.827 --> 37:34.058
Before my mom came,
nobody talked to me.

37:34.131 --> 37:36.396
They put me in the room,
I was locked in there.

37:36.601 --> 37:37.898
What about Rick?

37:38.603 --> 37:40.071
Rick? What about Rick?

37:40.506 --> 37:42.737
He was one of your kidnappers, right?

37:43.109 --> 37:44.406
Not exactly.

37:44.477 --> 37:47.379
What do you mean? I thought
he and Dan brought you to Gaines.

37:47.448 --> 37:50.146
It was mostly Dan. Not Rick.

37:50.219 --> 37:54.087
I think he was actually just as surprised
as we were about what was happening.

37:54.290 --> 37:55.485
Really?

37:55.826 --> 37:57.088
Yeah.

37:57.161 --> 37:59.654
He was fighting with Dan the entire time.

37:59.732 --> 38:01.597
He actually helped us escape.

38:01.767 --> 38:04.828
Okay, hold on, let's not get ahead
of ourselves. Can we...

38:06.507 --> 38:07.735
Hold on.

38:17.154 --> 38:18.884
- Myers.
- Hey, it's me.

38:18.957 --> 38:22.484
Chappelle reinstated me to provisional
status for the rest of the day...

38:22.561 --> 38:23.928
...at Palmer's request.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.089
That's great, Jack.

38:25.165 --> 38:27.395
Yeah. How's everything going over there?

38:27.935 --> 38:29.198
Not bad.

38:29.471 --> 38:32.134
- We're sending over two more teams.
- Why?

38:32.208 --> 38:34.473
Looks like Teri and Kim
were targets as well.

38:34.544 --> 38:35.738
Nina...

38:36.213 --> 38:38.739
...it is not information
they need to know, okay?

38:38.816 --> 38:39.909
No, of course.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.077
Good. Thanks.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.981
- Let me speak to Teri, okay?
- Sure.

38:50.966 --> 38:52.433
Teri?

38:55.104 --> 38:56.436
It's Jack.

39:00.879 --> 39:02.905
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey, sweetheart.

39:03.215 --> 39:05.081
You okay? How you doing?

39:05.819 --> 39:06.877
I'm okay.

39:07.221 --> 39:08.347
How's Kim?

39:08.556 --> 39:09.580
She's fine.

39:09.957 --> 39:13.326
I got a message that you wanted
to tell me something important.

39:15.231 --> 39:17.757
No, it's nothing important.

39:18.502 --> 39:20.800
Are you sure? You sound funny.

39:22.375 --> 39:24.275
It's nothing. I just...

39:24.410 --> 39:25.672
I just...

39:26.445 --> 39:28.141
I'm so tired.

39:28.882 --> 39:31.751
Why don't you just try
and get some rest, then, sweetheart.

39:31.820 --> 39:33.287
Listen, if...

39:33.822 --> 39:35.790
If you need anything
from the house...

39:35.858 --> 39:37.987
...I'll have someone go get it
for you. Okay?

39:38.062 --> 39:39.393
Yeah, okay.

39:41.300 --> 39:44.861
I got to go. I love you, okay?
I'll call you as soon as I can.

39:45.837 --> 39:47.670
Okay. Bye-bye.

40:03.796 --> 40:06.630
Mom. I'll be right back.

40:13.508 --> 40:14.907
So what did he say?

40:15.511 --> 40:16.944
I didn't tell him.

40:17.413 --> 40:18.437
Why not?

40:18.948 --> 40:20.781
It wasn't the right time.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.520
Just go back and finish with Nina, honey.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.112
What's wrong?

40:26.392 --> 40:27.484
Nothing.

40:27.560 --> 40:30.429
I just think you should finish answering
Nina's questions.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.429
Bauer.

40:39.075 --> 40:41.271
- Jack, it's Bob.
- Hey, Bob.

40:41.979 --> 40:44.609
I shot over a few more things to Milo...

40:44.817 --> 40:47.183
...but I still can't locate
the missing file.

40:47.253 --> 40:48.447
How can I help?

40:48.521 --> 40:51.457
I gave Milo enough for him
to try it on your end.

40:51.725 --> 40:54.025
The more I look at this,
the more I'm convinced...

40:54.096 --> 40:56.564
...the file was taken out deliberately.

40:58.634 --> 41:03.369
Which leads me to believe
it contains what we're looking for.

41:03.441 --> 41:06.934
Can you give me an estimate
of when you think the file was stolen?

41:07.012 --> 41:10.643
Also, a list of people who you think
could have had access to get in there?

41:10.718 --> 41:13.916
Not yet, but you tell Milo
that I got some ideas on how...

41:16.425 --> 41:17.483
Bob?

41:19.530 --> 41:20.588
Bob?

41:25.170 --> 41:26.229
Bob!

41:27.239 --> 41:28.832
Can you hear me?

41:30.310 --> 41:31.368
Bob!
