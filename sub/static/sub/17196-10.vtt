00:18.284 --> 00:20.686
(emmett)
previously on <i>gracepoint...</i>

00:20.688 --> 00:24.156
Cause of death: Blunt trauma,
one blow to the head.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.524
Harsh blow.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.159
Forensics from the hut.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.894
Boot print
in the mud up the hill

00:28.896 --> 00:30.629
Match with the print
they found inside.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.064
You're blacking out.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.632
I can't allow you
to carry a weapon.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.167
(emmett)
danny's life touched
many people.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.969
We'll be looking at
all those connections.

00:36.971 --> 00:40.472
If you or someone you know
has noticed anything unusual,

00:40.474 --> 00:42.408
Please, come forward now.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.209
I urge everyone,
don't hide anything,

00:44.211 --> 00:45.978
Because we will find out.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.247
If a member of your family
or a friend or a neighbor

00:48.249 --> 00:52.017
Has been behaving differently
in the past days or weeks,

00:52.019 --> 00:54.319
Please tell the police
immediately.

00:54.321 --> 00:57.022
There will be no hiding place
for danny's killer.

00:57.024 --> 01:00.225
We will catch whoever did this.

01:19.679 --> 01:21.447
I've got no choice here,
carver.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.083
I need until the end
of the day, eight hours.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.884
<i>(morgan)</i>
<i>what difference</i>
<i>will that make?</i>

01:25.886 --> 01:27.252
<i>The case is going</i>
<i>to detective miller.</i>

01:27.254 --> 01:29.054
You should consider
someone else.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.689
<i>Really?</i>

01:30.691 --> 01:31.623
After all this time,
I thought you'd grown

01:31.625 --> 01:32.624
To respect each other.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.360
I'll be out by 6:00.

01:35.362 --> 01:38.430
I've got another witness,
vince.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.299
She saw you that same night

01:40.301 --> 01:43.469
Carrying what looked like a body
towards mark's plumbing van.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.637
My mom needs her meds.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.306
And I need an explanation.

01:47.308 --> 01:51.076
She probably hasn't eaten
since yesterday morning.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.945
You either need to let me
go check on her,

01:52.947 --> 01:55.114
Or you have to send
someone over.

01:55.116 --> 01:58.550
I'm not saying anything
until I know she's all right.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.419
Get someone over
to vince's mother,

02:00.421 --> 02:02.654
And get back in with him.
What was he doing that night?

02:02.656 --> 02:04.590
What was he doing two nights ago
when we were at the hut?

02:04.592 --> 02:06.158
Minute by minute.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.726
If it wasn't vince
your sister saw, who was it?

02:07.728 --> 02:09.161
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.296
I'm sorry?

02:11.298 --> 02:12.498
Never mind.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.567
I am going to get some coffee,

02:15.569 --> 02:17.569
And then I'm following orders.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.738
I gotta check in with csi,
see what they got on the van.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.141
Did you find
your boy's computer?

02:24.511 --> 02:26.078
He says it was stolen.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.248
Do you believe him?

02:29.250 --> 02:31.917
I called joe,
asked him to come in.

02:31.919 --> 02:35.087
What, this morning?

02:35.089 --> 02:37.589
You're calling him in,
and you didn't tell me?

02:37.591 --> 02:39.324
I'm telling you now.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.365
You lost your computer.

02:46.367 --> 02:49.268
Right, I left it
in my bag at school,

02:49.270 --> 02:51.170
And it got stolen.

02:55.975 --> 02:58.877
Paul coates said
you threatened to accuse him

02:58.879 --> 03:02.347
Of hitting danny
if he gave this to us.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.949
You threatened
the priest?

03:03.951 --> 03:06.618
Did paul coates
ever hit danny?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.387
I don't know.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.690
[camcorder clicks off]

03:11.692 --> 03:13.292
We can, uh, we can wait
if you want to go get help.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.360
No, no, no.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.130
No, it's fine.
Wait.

03:18.132 --> 03:20.465
<i>I'll use my phone.</i>

03:20.467 --> 03:22.701
Here, all right.

03:27.473 --> 03:30.342
So...

03:30.344 --> 03:32.978
Did danny ever tell you
that paul hit him?

03:32.980 --> 03:34.913
No.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.381
Did you ever see anyone
hit danny?

03:38.818 --> 03:40.986
I never saw anyone else
hit danny.

03:40.988 --> 03:44.656
Why did you smash
your computer, tom?

03:44.658 --> 03:46.592
Go ahead, answer him.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.260
I had my emails on it.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.828
Your emails with whom?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.964
With danny.

03:58.705 --> 04:01.039
Are these your emails
with danny?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.541
How did you get those?

04:02.543 --> 04:04.676
Rescued from your hard drive.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.745
Danny was using
a different email address

04:06.747 --> 04:08.580
From his home computer.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.583
You're the only person he
wrote to from that new address.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.585
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>you and one other person.</i>

04:13.587 --> 04:16.555
Why didn't you tell us that
you and danny had been arguing?

04:16.557 --> 04:18.690
<i>Because in these emails,</i>

04:18.692 --> 04:21.059
Danny's being kind
of rough on you.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.362
You were reaching out to him
after his dad hit him,

04:23.364 --> 04:25.297
Asking him to come back
to the soccer team,

04:25.299 --> 04:28.900
And a little later,
he's calling you a dumb jock

04:28.902 --> 04:30.135
And a conformist.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.971
Why is he saying these things?

04:32.973 --> 04:35.641
I don't know.
He never explained it.

04:35.643 --> 04:38.243
And then finally
he wrote to you,

04:38.245 --> 04:41.647
"leave me alone.
You're a follower.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.650
"your dad's probably
disappointed in you too.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.252
He's bored by you.
You just don't know it."

04:47.254 --> 04:48.920
He really said that?

04:48.922 --> 04:51.290
Did it hurt you when you read
what your friend wrote?

04:51.292 --> 04:52.991
Maybe a little.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.962
Did it hurt you so much
that you wanted to hurt danny?

04:58.898 --> 05:01.066
Okay, we're done.
We're through here.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.101
<i>If you want to accuse my son,</i>
<i>we'll get a lawyer.</i>

05:03.103 --> 05:04.569
Yeah, we're through.
Come on.

05:04.571 --> 05:08.173
That's all for now anyway.

05:08.175 --> 05:13.278
Oh, tom, what shoe size are you?

05:13.280 --> 05:14.846
Six.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.116
What about you, joe?

05:18.118 --> 05:19.851
Ten.

05:26.025 --> 05:28.026
<i>(ellie)</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

05:28.028 --> 05:29.795
Why did you call me
all the way down here?

05:29.797 --> 05:32.764
I was here before,
on this beach.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.367
I came here as a kid.

05:35.369 --> 05:38.370
Some campground
close to the cliffs.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.673
I tried looking for it
when I first got here.

05:41.675 --> 05:45.977
You came to gracepoint
on vacation?
Yeah.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.646
My parents
were about to break up.

05:47.648 --> 05:51.783
They spent the entire time
fighting.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.786
How'd it go with vince?

05:54.788 --> 05:56.655
He says he was carrying
a small deer.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.690
A deer?
Mm-hmm.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.660
He claims he was out hunting
the night of danny's death.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.628
He says he cut through
a farmer's fence

06:03.630 --> 06:05.464
Out by hill road.

06:05.466 --> 06:09.034
Interesting.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.070
Um, I spoke to joe.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.673
He said things went all right.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.975
Took tom out for ice cream.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.478
Good.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.648
Well, did it go okay?

06:23.650 --> 06:26.718
[phone buzzing]

06:31.257 --> 06:32.491
Hello.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.192
Danny's smartphone's back on.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.094
We have coordinates and a trace
on the signal.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.163

<i>Okay.</i>

06:44.003 --> 06:45.237
What's going on?

06:45.239 --> 06:46.605
I got to take a call.

06:46.607 --> 06:50.409
My last day.
Lots to...Wrap up.

06:50.411 --> 06:53.011
I can wait if you--

06:53.013 --> 06:54.746
No, no, no,
I got yeaton.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.615
Go, get back in

06:56.617 --> 06:58.784
Go, I'll meet you there.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.287
All right.

07:04.524 --> 07:05.857

09:44.918 --> 09:46.384

oh, it's beautiful.

09:46.386 --> 09:49.521
White sands, huge mountains,

09:49.523 --> 09:52.457
Cranky toddlers.

09:52.459 --> 09:53.758
[zipper sound]

09:53.760 --> 09:56.127

Thanks.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.370
I missed you.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.806
I missed you too.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.875
Things been okay here?

10:10.877 --> 10:12.777
No more dad drama?

10:12.779 --> 10:14.713
No.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.315
I really did miss you,
you know.

10:19.318 --> 10:21.686
Hmm.

10:31.497 --> 10:33.465
Don't.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.967
(joe)
it was the first time
we'd met there.

10:35.969 --> 10:41.339
We'd only spent afternoons
at the house.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.509
Tom was at soccer
and dylan napping.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.745
Afternoons doing what?

10:46.747 --> 10:49.581
Talking.

10:49.583 --> 10:53.251
And that's it, just getting
to know each other.

10:53.253 --> 10:56.187
How long were you
doing this?

10:56.189 --> 10:59.791
Maybe three months,
a little less.

10:59.793 --> 11:03.962
<i>Danny came over one day upset,</i>
<i>looking for tom.</i>

11:03.964 --> 11:08.933
He told me mark was pissed
that he had quit the team,

11:08.935 --> 11:11.236
That he'd hit him.

11:12.538 --> 11:14.139
Go on.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.341
I listened.

11:17.943 --> 11:20.111
I think that meant something
to him.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.713
So you lured him
to the hut.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.783
I didn't lure him.
We planned to meet after mexico.

11:24.785 --> 11:28.119
To continue your chats.
And what else?

11:28.121 --> 11:30.488
I don't know, neither of us
knew what would happen.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.390
Come on, joe.
<i>No, it's true.</i>

11:32.392 --> 11:35.293
And the second he said no,
the second he pulled back,

11:35.295 --> 11:36.861
I respected that.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.800
I--I can't do this.

11:41.802 --> 11:45.470
Oh, come on, danny,
sit down.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.539
No, I shouldn't
have come here.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.141
You don't mean that.
Come.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.910
Don't touch me.
What?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.978
Don't be ridiculous.
It's me.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.814
I have to go.
Well, not like this.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.749
We need to figure out--

11:57.751 --> 11:59.417
Danny!
Aah!

12:04.023 --> 12:05.557
Danny!

12:10.763 --> 12:12.564
We were both scared...

12:12.566 --> 12:15.233
[sighs]
and confused.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.069
The boy was 12 years old.
I know.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.939
It was too much for him.
I get that now.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.777
He ran to the edge of the cliff
and threatened to jump.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.346
I told him everything was okay.
I was sorry.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.549
I said, "go home, just go home.
Everything will be fine."

12:31.551 --> 12:32.951
No, it won't be.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.620
Yes, it will.
I promise.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.889
You're not normal.
You're sick.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.624
It's my problem.

12:39.626 --> 12:40.692
You should just go home.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.861
Just go home, go to bed,

12:42.863 --> 12:44.429
And we'll forget
this ever happened.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.131
We'll forget we were
ever friends.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.899
Is that what you want,

12:47.901 --> 12:50.702
To forget that you
ever knew me?

12:50.704 --> 12:52.804
Of course not.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.472
Danny!

12:54.474 --> 12:57.308
And no one has
to know about this--

12:57.310 --> 13:00.044
Not tom,

13:00.046 --> 13:02.814
Not your parents.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.048
I have to tell them.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.583
You don't.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.118
You can't.

13:19.064 --> 13:20.298
Danny?

13:23.068 --> 13:27.605
It was an accident.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.774
I thought he was running away.
I-I grabbed for him.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.676
I grabbed his sweatshirt.

13:35.681 --> 13:37.916
He just tripped,

13:37.918 --> 13:42.420
<i>Slammed his head into a rock,</i>
<i>hard.</i>

13:42.422 --> 13:43.955
I never,
ever meant to hurt him.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.256
I cared about him.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.159
I care about him.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.123
This is not who I am.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.059
No?

16:01.061 --> 16:03.895
You were attracted to him.
Sexually.

16:03.897 --> 16:06.264
I'm not sure why
that matters now.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.999
<i>It all matters now.</i>

16:08.001 --> 16:10.568
I need to have the facts, joe.
I got to understand.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.770
If I can't understand it,
why should you?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.739
[whispering]
it was a horrible accident.

16:14.741 --> 16:17.241
Did you slam his head against
a rock when he refused you?

16:17.243 --> 16:19.277
No, absolutely not.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.812
But you were angry with him.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.113
No.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.248
The $500 we found
in danny's room,

16:24.250 --> 16:25.750
Was that from you?

16:25.752 --> 16:27.518
It was for his
cell phone bills,

16:27.520 --> 16:29.620
So he could pay in cash.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.622
<i>I told ellie I needed it</i>
<i>for the house,</i>

16:31.624 --> 16:33.658
Home repair stuff.

16:36.128 --> 16:38.763
I've destroyed my own family.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.298
The night before
at the hut,

16:40.300 --> 16:42.567
Why did you call
and then take off?

16:43.535 --> 16:45.603
I wanted it to be you,

16:45.605 --> 16:48.606
Just you, to confess.

16:48.608 --> 16:52.443
<i>It was just too much</i>
<i>with jack's suicide</i>

16:52.445 --> 16:54.412
<i>And lying to ellie.</i>

16:56.448 --> 16:58.583
And once I saw her,
I just ran.

17:02.821 --> 17:06.124
Does she know?

17:06.126 --> 17:07.759
No.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.864
I can't tell her.

17:16.168 --> 17:19.037
You have to tell her.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.676
Csi's scouring the van.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.478
What do you think
we're gonna find when we--

17:27.480 --> 17:28.913
Sir, do you mind?
Interview terminated.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.483
<i>(ellie)</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

17:32.485 --> 17:33.985
That is my suspect.

17:33.987 --> 17:36.087
Sit down, miller.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.322
What's going on?

17:38.324 --> 17:39.357
It's not him.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.858
How do you know?

17:40.860 --> 17:43.661
Please sit.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.730
Please.

17:49.668 --> 17:52.603
[sighs]

17:52.605 --> 17:55.106
I have to ask you
a couple of questions.

17:57.843 --> 18:01.846
Where were you the night
of danny solano's death?

18:01.848 --> 18:03.347
What?
I'll explain.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.949
Let's keep things simple.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.351
I'll ask questions.
You give me answers.

18:07.353 --> 18:08.553
You think it was me?
Where were you?

18:08.555 --> 18:11.022
Are you--you're serious.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.858
Please, ellie.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.026
Do not call me ellie.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.394
Tell me where you were

18:16.396 --> 18:19.297
The night
danny solano died.

18:20.232 --> 18:23.868
I was in bed.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.804
We'd just got back
from vacation that day.

18:26.806 --> 18:30.141
We had been flying all day,
two flights, a long drive.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.976
I was exhausted.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.444
I got dylan in the bath.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.379
I got the kids
to brush their teeth.

18:35.381 --> 18:36.647
I unpacked.

18:36.649 --> 18:39.317
I took a sleeping pill,
and I went to bed.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.918
What time?

18:40.920 --> 18:44.922
I--I don't know.
Early-ish, 9:00, 9:15.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.491
Did you notice joe
come to bed?

18:46.493 --> 18:48.426
No, I just told you
I was exhausted,

18:48.428 --> 18:50.128
And those sleeping pills--

18:50.130 --> 18:52.063
I'm not answering any more
of these questions.

18:52.065 --> 18:53.531
Tell me what's happening.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.337
What are you doing?

18:59.339 --> 19:02.273
Huh?

19:02.275 --> 19:05.309
Why are you coming close
to me?

19:09.281 --> 19:13.451
It was joe.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.320
Joe killed danny solano.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.791
Why are--why would you
even say that?

19:20.793 --> 19:22.460
Why--why are you
saying that?

19:22.462 --> 19:25.163
<i>What--</i>

19:26.098 --> 19:27.465
He didn't do that.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.101
He would never do something
like that.

19:30.103 --> 19:32.336
We have him in custody.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.505
He confessed.

19:55.395 --> 19:58.396
No, but susan wright

20:00.567 --> 20:03.134
Medium build,
medium height,

20:03.136 --> 20:06.204
Same hat pulled down low.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.572
She thought it was vince.

20:07.574 --> 20:11.142
Maybe she wanted it
to be vince,

20:11.144 --> 20:13.244
But it was joe.

20:13.246 --> 20:16.681
No, not joe.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.316
<i>[whispers]</i>
<i>please not joe.</i>

20:18.318 --> 20:21.118
You're wrong.

20:22.187 --> 20:25.089
I'm not wrong.

20:32.164 --> 20:35.533
I have to see him.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.501
You don't touch him.

20:37.503 --> 20:40.438
You don't do anything that would
compromise the investigation.

20:55.854 --> 20:57.989
Ellie.

21:00.225 --> 21:02.260
Sweetheart--
is it true?

21:07.199 --> 21:08.899
I'm not what you think
I am.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.335
What are you?

21:12.971 --> 21:14.605
He was

21:14.607 --> 21:18.109
12...Years...Old.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.510
I know.

21:22.147 --> 21:23.214
I can't explain.

21:23.216 --> 21:27.618
12...Years...Old!

21:30.222 --> 21:33.424
I just need you to know
I'm a good man.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.341
Aah!
No!

21:50.343 --> 21:52.176
Why?

21:52.178 --> 21:54.078
Why did you do that?

21:54.080 --> 21:58.816
Why?
No--why?

Don't answer the phone
if it isn't me.

22:26.445 --> 22:30.114
This doesn't make sense.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.216
It just doesn't make sense.

22:32.218 --> 22:36.620
Well, he claims it doesn't
to him either,

22:36.622 --> 22:41.325
That it was someone else,
some other part of him.

22:41.327 --> 22:45.830
How could he say "I'm
a good man" after what he did?

22:45.832 --> 22:48.332
All these years,

22:48.334 --> 22:50.234
This is who he was?

This is what he...

22:55.307 --> 22:57.308
Wanted?

22:57.310 --> 23:01.545
I wish I had
some answers for you.

It's gonna take time.

Ready.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.722
Thank you, frank.

23:17.429 --> 23:19.663
I'll tell the solano family.

23:19.665 --> 23:22.199
At 6:00 p.M. I'll make
a brief statement to the media,

23:22.201 --> 23:24.602
And then we all need
to be ready.

23:24.604 --> 23:29.273
This is gonna crack open
a fault line in this town.

23:29.275 --> 23:32.176
You all know detective miller.

She has been removed
from the case

23:34.447 --> 23:38.182
And placed on leave
with full pay.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.384
There's no suggestion she knew,

23:40.386 --> 23:44.288
Absolutely no suggestion
she covered anything up.

23:44.290 --> 23:45.890
You're her colleagues
and friends.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.025
She's gonna need you.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.860

meeting secretly for months.

Oh, my god.

What does that mean?

We don't know the details,

Just that we believe

No, it wasn't.

He wouldn't.

He didn't.

26:12.871 --> 26:16.173
He did.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.742
I'm so sorry.

26:22.781 --> 26:27.017
I have no idea what
would make him

26:27.019 --> 26:28.619
Do something like that,

26:28.621 --> 26:30.754
But I do know that
it is not your fault

a question though.

Did your dad ever...
Touch you or dylan?

27:10.663 --> 27:13.330
Did he ever do anything
physical

That made you feel
uncomfortable?

27:16.736 --> 27:19.103
No. Never.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.237
You can tell me, tom.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.740
You can tell me if he did.

He didn't.

<i>No one has to know</i>
<i>about this--</i>

30:26.192 --> 30:28.525
Not tom, not your parents.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.061
(danny)
I have to tell them.
You can't.

30:36.434 --> 30:39.303
What are you doing to him?
What are you doing?

30:39.305 --> 30:40.771
Stop!
Leave him, dad!

30:40.773 --> 30:42.673
He's my friend!
(joe)
stop, stop!

30:51.549 --> 30:53.016
Danny?

30:54.319 --> 30:56.486
Danny.

30:56.488 --> 30:57.888
Danny!

30:57.890 --> 31:00.858
Come on.
Danny.

31:18.977 --> 31:20.143
Go home.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.312
But--
go to bed.

31:22.314 --> 31:25.582
Don't do anything.
Don't say anything.

31:25.584 --> 31:28.485
This is my fault.
This is completely my fault.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.053
I will take care of it.

31:32.557 --> 31:33.790
Go!

31:44.569 --> 31:46.937
What are we gonna do?

31:49.440 --> 31:53.143
Mom, what are we gonna do?

32:04.856 --> 32:06.290
[buzzer]

32:08.192 --> 32:09.593
Here?

32:09.595 --> 32:12.262
I can give you
five minutes, mark.

32:21.105 --> 32:22.139
Mark.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.840
[sniffles]

32:26.044 --> 32:29.079
You were our friend.

32:29.081 --> 32:31.715
You were in our home.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.784
I'm sorry.

32:33.786 --> 32:36.486
I'm so sorry.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.422
I left him on the beach
so you would find him.

32:38.424 --> 32:39.656
Do you hear yourself?

32:39.658 --> 32:42.159
He came to me.
That's how it started,

32:42.161 --> 32:44.394
Because you let him down.
You hit him.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.730
One time.
And I hate myself for it,

32:46.732 --> 32:48.332
And I'm gonna have
to suffer with that

32:48.334 --> 32:50.600
For the rest of my life.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.235
You did things to him,
didn't you?

32:52.237 --> 32:54.004
You did.

32:54.006 --> 32:56.006
I know you say you didn't,
but I know you're lying.

32:56.008 --> 32:57.507
I'm not.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.277
I swear.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.512
There are things
you don't know.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.815
I cared about danny.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.783
I would never intentionally
hurt him.

33:06.785 --> 33:07.951
I really cared for him.

33:07.953 --> 33:10.654
He's not yours to care for!

33:13.524 --> 33:16.026
For your sake,
I hope they keep you locked up

33:16.028 --> 33:18.228
For a long time.

33:19.764 --> 33:21.832
[knocking on door]

33:26.704 --> 33:28.171
All right?

33:36.547 --> 33:38.615
Hey.
Hey.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.250
Here.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.955
Just go for a walk
or whatever you need.

33:44.957 --> 33:46.189
Yeah.
Just...

33:46.191 --> 33:47.891
Okay.
Okay?

33:47.893 --> 33:51.895
I got comic books,
processed sugar.

33:51.897 --> 33:55.065
You hanging in there,
bud?

33:55.067 --> 33:57.367
Tom's gonna be fine.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.238
We all are...

34:01.240 --> 34:03.640
Right?

34:03.642 --> 34:05.909
Okay, thank you.
Yeah.

34:07.845 --> 34:09.713
Bye.

35:00.898 --> 35:02.999
Beth.

35:04.702 --> 35:06.970
How could you not know?

35:29.827 --> 35:31.428
Hey, this is julianne.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.497
Leave a message,
and we'll talk soon, maybe.

35:33.499 --> 35:36.266
Bye.
Hey, it's me, dad.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.835
This'll be a surprise,
but I'm thinking

35:38.837 --> 35:43.106
Of taking your advice
to take care of myself

35:43.108 --> 35:46.009
And maybe get that surgery

35:46.011 --> 35:48.778
I've been avoiding
down in san francisco.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.947
Anyway, I was wondering, um,

35:50.949 --> 35:53.750
When your graduation is
exactly?

35:53.752 --> 35:55.519
I was thinking I could, um,

35:55.521 --> 35:57.254
Schedule it for after.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.990
I could come there, and then
you could visit me, maybe.

35:59.992 --> 36:03.927
Spoon-feed your invalid father.
How's that for an offer, huh?

36:03.929 --> 36:05.929
Anyway, no obligation.

36:05.931 --> 36:08.665
Okay, so that's it.

36:08.667 --> 36:12.102
Give me a call
if you ever feel like it.

36:12.104 --> 36:16.506
You're not too angry,
I hope.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.241
I love you.

36:31.556 --> 36:33.223
It's time, mark.

36:33.225 --> 36:35.392
(paul)
the bible says

36:35.394 --> 36:39.896
Let all bitterness and wrath

36:39.898 --> 36:42.966
And anger and clamor and slander

36:42.968 --> 36:47.237
Be put away from you,
along with all malice.

36:47.239 --> 36:50.840
The lord is faithful
and righteous,

36:50.842 --> 36:53.710
Cleansing us
from unrighteousness.

36:58.015 --> 37:00.650
Be kind to one another,

37:00.652 --> 37:04.154
Tender hearted,
forgiving one another,

37:04.156 --> 37:07.424
As god in christ forgave you.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.629
[buzzer]

37:16.567 --> 37:19.536
That's what you meant by
"I'm a good man"?

37:19.538 --> 37:21.938
He shouldn't have told you.
Why?

37:21.940 --> 37:23.173
I was trying to protect him.

37:23.175 --> 37:24.941
You were with
his best friend.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.677
That's why I'm doing this.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.347
What happened was my fault.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.915
That, and I love tom.
I love you.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.183
Don't say that.

37:33.185 --> 37:34.718
Don't you dare say that
to me.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.620
It's true.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.622
I never touched danny.

37:38.624 --> 37:40.290
But you were going to.

37:46.530 --> 37:49.899
What do I do?

37:49.901 --> 37:52.936
Tell me what you want.

37:54.705 --> 37:56.906
Do I know everything now?

37:56.908 --> 37:58.241
Yes.

37:58.243 --> 38:01.878
All of it,
every single bit of it,

38:01.880 --> 38:03.780
Stays between us.

38:21.732 --> 38:26.403
Whole town's turned out,
looks like.

38:26.405 --> 38:28.672
Except for us.

38:32.076 --> 38:34.377
You always said
I was too close...

38:36.080 --> 38:39.149
That I couldn't see what was
right in front of me.

38:41.252 --> 38:45.322
I wanted to be wrong.
I really did.

38:46.991 --> 38:50.794
What made you know
it was joe?

38:50.796 --> 38:53.963
Who could it be
if it wasn't vince?

38:53.965 --> 38:58.034
And the way he behaved
when tom was being interviewed.

39:00.604 --> 39:04.441
And then the email account
on danny's missing phone--

39:04.443 --> 39:07.544
It only had two contacts,

39:07.546 --> 39:11.348
Tom...And him.

39:19.490 --> 39:20.990
Are you leaving?

39:20.992 --> 39:24.060
I shouldn't be here.

39:24.062 --> 39:27.564
And I--I need to get
back to...

39:29.066 --> 39:32.535
This doesn't feel right
to me, miller.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.705
I hope you know that.

39:35.707 --> 39:39.476
I just keep thinking
about your family, your boys.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.811
My boys will be fine.

39:41.813 --> 39:44.247
I'll make sure of it.

39:44.249 --> 39:47.317
What you gonna do?

39:47.319 --> 39:49.252
Take them someplace else.

39:49.254 --> 39:51.988
Give them a new start.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.823
Away from gracepoint?

39:53.825 --> 39:55.992
How can we stay here?

39:55.994 --> 39:58.895
How can we walk down
main street?

40:03.501 --> 40:08.104
Look at us...
The former detectives club.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.244
Good night, emmett.

40:15.212 --> 40:16.746
Night.

41:05.830 --> 41:07.997
Hey, look.

41:15.739 --> 41:19.576
They're everywhere.

41:19.578 --> 41:21.511
<i>(mark)</i>
<i>how'd everybody know?</i>

41:26.650 --> 41:30.854
Paul, was that you?

41:30.856 --> 41:34.190
I passed the word.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.192
Maybe the word was good.

<i>What?</i>

42:02.787 --> 42:04.320
Your phone.

42:04.322 --> 42:07.123
Uh, yes. Hi, julianne.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.792
June 11th.
Sorry?

42:09.794 --> 42:12.662
You wanted to know
when my graduation was.

42:12.664 --> 42:14.297
Right, I'll be there.

42:14.299 --> 42:17.901
Good, and I will be there
for your procedure.

42:17.903 --> 42:19.669
No, I really shouldn't
have asked that.

42:19.671 --> 42:22.238
That won't be much fun.
They're cutting you open.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.674
You think I'm gonna
leave you alone?

42:24.676 --> 42:26.376
Thank you.

42:26.378 --> 42:27.644
Bye, daddy.

42:27.646 --> 42:30.179
Congrats on figuring out
your phone.
