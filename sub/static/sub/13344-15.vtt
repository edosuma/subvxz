WEBVTT

00:06.207 --> 00:08.476
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY, ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.576 --> 00:10.778
ARE YOU SAYING THAT I PUSHED
KATE INTO THIS SITUATION?

00:10.878 --> 00:13.947
THAT I CREATED
THIS ENVIRONMENT AT HOME

00:14.048 --> 00:16.417
SO THAT KATE COULD GO
FUCK AN INSURANCE AGENT

00:16.517 --> 00:19.253
BECAUSE REALLY
I'M IN LOVE WITH LAURA?

00:19.353 --> 00:22.423
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST
DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY

00:22.523 --> 00:25.426
THAT LAURA'S BETTER OFF
WITH A DIFFERENT THERAPIST.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.962
I AM NOT SENDING LAURA
TO ANOTHER THERAPIST.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.898
END OF STORY.

00:30.998 --> 00:34.702
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
YOU WERE FACED WITH THE SAME
SCENARIO YOURSELF.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.571
DON'T FORGET I WAS THE ONE
WHO REFERRED CHARLIE TO YOU.

00:37.671 --> 00:40.574
YOU KNOW THAT HE NEVER
EVER GOT OVER YOU.

00:40.674 --> 00:43.111
YOU FAILED THE SAME TEST
YOURSELF, GINA.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.313
BUT YOU ABANDONED
A PATIENT.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.620
- HI, PAUL.
- HI, GINA.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.906
HOW ARE YOU, PAUL?

01:13.006 --> 01:14.708
I'M FINE.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.910
YES?

01:17.010 --> 01:19.613
WHY, DO I NOT
SEEM FINE?

01:19.713 --> 01:22.049
YOU SEEM... ANTSY.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.617
( sighs )

01:23.717 --> 01:26.720
I JUST KEEP NEEDING
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.857
OH, YOU REMEMBER WHERE IT IS.
THE DOOR ON YOUR RIGHT--

01:29.957 --> 01:31.859
NO, I MEAN, ALL THE TIME.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.061
IT'S...

01:34.162 --> 01:36.464
- A URINARY THING.
- OH, I SEE.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.899
- HAVE YOU SEEN A DOCTOR?
- YEAH.

01:38.999 --> 01:41.068
IT'S GETTING BETTER.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.703
BUT IT'S STILL
A TERRIBLE SENSATION.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.373
YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM,
YOU STAND THERE, YOU...

01:45.473 --> 01:48.209
WILL IT TO HAPPEN-- NOTHING.
NOT A DROP.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.278
IT'S SO UNCOMFORTABLE,

01:50.378 --> 01:53.181
THIS AND THE STRESS
YOU'RE UNDER.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.384
WHAT?

01:56.484 --> 01:57.518
( scoffs )

01:57.618 --> 01:59.220
JESUS.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.888
YOU THINK
IT'S PSYCHOSOMATIC...

02:00.988 --> 02:03.857
- NO, NOT AT ALL.
- ...A SYMBOLIC URINARY
INFECTION.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.493
SYMBOLIC HOW?

02:05.593 --> 02:08.229
MY HEAD'S
TELLING ME ONE THING,
MY BODY'S TELLING ME ANOTHER.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.164
MY PRECISE ISSUE,
MANIFESTING ITSELF

02:10.264 --> 02:13.834
AS A PHYSICAL
MALFUNCTION OF THE...
( sighs )

02:14.902 --> 02:16.404
YES?

02:16.504 --> 02:19.440
SHIT. DID YOU SAY
IT WAS ON THE RIGHT?

02:19.540 --> 02:21.275
YEAH.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.344
EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.347
( door closes )

02:26.447 --> 02:28.782
( theme music playing )

02:46.967 --> 02:49.002
THERE'S NO SOAP
IN THERE.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.539
REALLY?
I THOUGHT I SAW SOAP.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.642
( sighs )

03:00.080 --> 03:02.616
ARE YOU ANGRY?

03:04.485 --> 03:06.454
IT FEELS LIKE
YOU'RE ANGRY TONIGHT.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.756
I'D SAY THAT'S A FAIRLY
ACCURATE ASSESSMENT.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.391
YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHY?

03:10.491 --> 03:13.827
ACTUALLY, I'M ANGRY
AT MYSELF...

03:15.195 --> 03:16.864
FOR TAKING YOUR ADVICE,

03:16.964 --> 03:18.966
EVEN THOUGH
I KNEW BETTER.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.768
MY ADVICE?

03:20.868 --> 03:23.804
TAKING YOUR ADVICE
LIKE A NOVICE,
LIKE A NAIVE INTERN.

03:23.904 --> 03:27.941
IGNORING EVERY CELL
IN MY BODY AND LISTENING
TO YOU INSTEAD, GINA.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.943
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:30.043 --> 03:31.879
( sighs )

03:31.979 --> 03:33.614
AHEM.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.416
I MET WITH LAURA

03:35.516 --> 03:38.719
AND WE TALKED ABOUT
ENDING OUR SESSIONS.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.454
IT WAS A TOTAL DISASTER.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.223
IT DID THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT YOU PREDICTED.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.260
IT WAS JUST DESTRUCTIVE.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.129
IT SABOTAGED
A YEAR OF THERAPY.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.498
HOW?

03:50.598 --> 03:52.833
BECAUSE IT UNDERMINED
HER FAITH IN ME

03:52.933 --> 03:55.636
AND IN THE WORK THAT
WE'D DONE TOGETHER.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.971
SHE ASKED ME IF I WAS ENDING
OUR SESSIONS BECAUSE

03:58.071 --> 03:59.573
I'M IN LOVE WITH HER.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.343
THAT-- WELL, THAT'S WHAT
SHE HEARD ME SAY.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.512
WHAT SHE HEARD WAS,

04:04.612 --> 04:07.315
"I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU
SO I CAN'T SEE YOU ANYMORE."

04:07.415 --> 04:10.451
HOW-- HOW DID YOU
PUT IT EXACTLY?

04:10.551 --> 04:12.820
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT
I HANDLED IT BADLY?

04:12.920 --> 04:15.689
NO. I JUST WANT
TO HEAR WHAT YOU SAID.

04:15.789 --> 04:19.927
WELL, I SAID WE SHOULD
DISCUSS THE OPTION OF--

04:20.027 --> 04:22.330
OF ENDING THERAPY.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.565
YOU DIDN'T JUST DROP IT
ON HER OUT OF THE BLUE?

04:24.665 --> 04:26.800
OF COURSE I DIDN'T.
I-- I BUILT UP TO IT.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.103
SHE CAME IN LATE.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.373
I THOUGHT
THAT WAS IMPORTANT,

04:32.473 --> 04:35.142
LIKE IT WAS HER WAY
OF TELLING ME SOMETHING.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.777
I'M NOT FOLLOWING.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.747
I SAID I THOUGHT THAT
HER BEING LATE WAS
HER WAY OF SAYING

04:39.847 --> 04:43.283
THAT SHE WAS ANGRY AT ME,
THAT SHE WAS...

04:43.384 --> 04:45.586
AMBIVALENT ABOUT
HER THERAPY.

04:45.686 --> 04:48.188
WELL, OF COURSE SHE THREW IT
BACK AND SHE ASKED IF--

04:48.288 --> 04:52.493
AND SHE DOES HAVE A POINT--
SHE ASKED IF SHE WASN'T
THE FIRST PERSON

04:52.593 --> 04:55.295
EVER TO FALL IN LOVE
WITH HER THERAPIST.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.332
AND THEN SHE TOLD ME
TO DEAL WITH IT.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.434
( chuckles )

05:00.534 --> 05:02.970
MEANING, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS MY JOB.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.972
SHE'S RIGHT.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.942
SHE SAID, "YOU ARE-- YOU ARE
AN EXPERIENCED THERAPIST.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.310
JUST DEAL WITH IT."

05:10.411 --> 05:12.245
ARE YOU SURPRISED
AT HER REACTION?

05:12.346 --> 05:14.114
YOU PUT IT ON HER
AND SHE THREW IT BACK.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.384
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED--

05:16.484 --> 05:19.420
GINA, YOU HAMMERED ME
ABOUT THIS LAST WEEK.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.955
YOU WENT ON AND ON
AND ON ABOUT IT--

05:22.055 --> 05:23.924
I KNEW IT WAS
A BAD IDEA.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.326
AND NOW I'M COMING TO YOU
WITH THIS MESS, AND ALL--

05:26.427 --> 05:28.696
PAUL, YOU'RE NOT
AN INTERN--

05:28.796 --> 05:32.132
FAR FROM IT.
DON'T PLAY THE INTERN.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.334
IF YOU THINK
SOMETHING'S A BAD IDEA,

05:34.435 --> 05:36.437
YOU DON'T DO IT
BECAUSE I SUGGESTED IT.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.205
I SAID WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT IT.

05:38.305 --> 05:41.842
YOU WERE FURIOUS,
LIKE I WAS TRYING TO TAKE
LAURA AWAY FROM YOU.

05:41.942 --> 05:45.078
TWO DAYS LATER YOU ABRUPTLY
TRY TO STOP HER TREATMENT.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.682
YOU SAID THAT
ENDING THE THERAPY WAS
THE BEST GOOD SOLUTION.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.251
I SAID IT MIGHT BE
NECESSARY FOR HER SAKE.

05:51.351 --> 05:55.489
WHEN YOU SAY "GOOD SOLUTION,"
I THINK YOU MEAN A SOLUTION
TO YOUR PROBLEMS.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.324
IS THAT WHAT I MEAN?

05:57.425 --> 05:59.393
I'M ASSUMING
YOU ACTED HASTILY

05:59.493 --> 06:01.495
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS NECESSARY,

06:01.595 --> 06:03.531
THAT IT HAD TO BE
DEALT WITH QUICKLY.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.899
WHAT DO YOU WANT, GINA?
DO YOU WANT--?

06:05.999 --> 06:08.436
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?
DO YOU WANT ME TO TALK
ABOUT LAURA?

06:08.536 --> 06:10.370
DO YOU WANT US TO HAVE
A "LAURA" SESSION?

06:10.471 --> 06:13.306
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?
THAT I SIT OPPOSITE HER
AND SAY,

06:13.407 --> 06:16.677
"OH, WHAT IF?"

06:19.980 --> 06:22.215
WELL, I DO.

06:22.315 --> 06:26.019
YOU THINK I'M
IN DENIAL ABOUT IT?

06:26.119 --> 06:27.755
I'M NOT.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.691
LAURA IS...

06:32.526 --> 06:35.696
SHE'S ATTRACTIVE.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.766
ANYBODY WHO'S
A THERAPIST KNOWS THAT...

06:38.866 --> 06:40.868
LOOK, I KNOW ALL
THE WAYS IN WITH HER,

06:40.968 --> 06:42.836
ALL THE DOORS I COULD
OPEN IF I WANTED.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.005
DO YOU IMAGINE OPENING
THOSE DOORS?

06:45.105 --> 06:47.107
YES, I DO.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.714
YEP, I, UH...

06:53.814 --> 06:55.182
( snorts )

06:55.282 --> 06:58.051
I FANTASIZE...

06:58.151 --> 07:00.621
ABOUT LAURA.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.759
LOOK, IT'S LIKE--
IT'S LIKE A GYNECOLOGIST.

07:05.859 --> 07:09.429
IT'S EASIER FOR WOMEN
TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR
MALE GYNECOLOGIST

07:09.530 --> 07:12.399
DOESN'T HAVE ANY SEXUAL
DESIRE FOR THEM.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.067
AHEM.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.304
OF COURSE, THEY WANT HIM
TO FIND THEIR BODIES
ATTRACTIVE AS WELL.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.639
- PAUL.
- DON'T THEY?

07:18.739 --> 07:20.908
DON'T EVEN TRY TO BREAK
DOWN THE RELATIONSHIP

07:21.008 --> 07:23.010
BETWEEN A WOMAN
AND HER GYNECOLOGIST.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.177
THAT'S THE DEEP END.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.179
( chuckles )

07:30.250 --> 07:33.887
ANYWAY, LAST WEEK, I...

07:35.523 --> 07:39.026
I GOT THIS SHARP

07:39.126 --> 07:40.661
KIND OF PAIN.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.163
SO I WENT
TO THE UROLOGIST

07:43.263 --> 07:45.065
ON MONDAY
AND I THOUGHT,

07:45.165 --> 07:47.635
"WOW, THIS IS--

07:47.735 --> 07:49.803
THIS IS REALLY SCARY."

07:49.903 --> 07:50.938
HMM.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.406
AND THEN THIS RANDOM
THOUGHT COMES INTO MY HEAD

07:53.507 --> 07:55.342
BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD
IN THE ROOM AND I THINK

07:55.442 --> 07:58.011
MY DICK IS SHRINKING
AND I DON'T WANT
THE DOCTOR TO THINK

07:58.111 --> 08:01.214
THAT, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S THE REAL SIZE.
I MEAN, IT WAS JUST--

08:01.314 --> 08:05.152
- ( laughing )
- YEAH.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.557
PAUL.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.824
( chuckles )

08:10.924 --> 08:12.626
YOU KNOW, THERE IS
NO CONNECTION

08:12.726 --> 08:15.663
BETWEEN A GYNECOLOGIST'S
OFFICE AND...

08:15.763 --> 08:18.566
THE INTIMACY BETWEEN
THERAPIST AND PATIENT.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.868
I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU THINK
THE CONNECTION IS.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.402
ALL I'M SAYING, GINA,
IS THAT

08:22.502 --> 08:24.772
AS A MALE THERAPIST
SITTING ACROSS

08:24.872 --> 08:27.908
FROM A BEAUTIFUL
PATIENT, I...

08:28.008 --> 08:31.144
I KNOW EXACTLY

08:31.244 --> 08:33.313
HOW TO ENGAGE HER.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.716
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE

08:35.816 --> 08:38.351
TO-- TO TURN HER ON.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.087
YOU KNOW
WHAT TURNS HER ON?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.388
- YES, I DO.
- WHAT?

08:41.488 --> 08:43.624
ANY NUMBER OF THINGS.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.894
BUT I COULD MANIPULATE HER
TO DO ANYTHING I WANTED.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.428
I KNOW THAT.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.032
AND I DOUBT IF IT'S
ONLY MALE THERAPISTS
WHO HAVE THOSE THOUGHTS.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.234
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

08:54.334 --> 08:58.038
FOR EXAMPLE, IF A MALE
DOCTOR PERFORMS AN EXAMINATION

08:58.138 --> 09:01.174
ON A FEMALE PATIENT,
THERE'D BE A NURSE
PRESENT, RIGHT?

09:01.274 --> 09:03.110
I MEAN,
THAT'S FOR A REASON.

09:03.210 --> 09:07.180
AM I THE NURSE?
I KEEP YOU FROM CROSSING
THE LINE.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.549
IS THAT WHY
YOU CAME TO ME?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.754
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT WORRIES ME.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.389
YOU HAVE BOUNDARIES TOO,

09:16.489 --> 09:19.092
AND JUST LIKE YOU,
THIS WOMAN KNOWS HOW
TO CROSS THEM.

09:19.192 --> 09:22.095
GINA, ALL I'M SAYING IS
THAT THE TEMPTATION IS THERE--

09:22.195 --> 09:24.698
FOR ANY THERAPIST.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.301
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.537
I MEAN, IF I WERE
A GYNECOLOGIST

09:30.638 --> 09:32.572
AND I WERE PERFORMING
AN EXAMINATION,

09:32.673 --> 09:34.474
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T
ACCIDENTALLY START TO--

09:34.574 --> 09:36.710
OH, PAUL,
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.113
YOU KNOW, YOU SAY YOU HAVE
NO PROBLEM DISCUSSING LAURA.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.582
AND THEN I BRING HER UP,

09:42.683 --> 09:47.354
AND SUDDENLY IT'S--
IT'S ALL ABOUT GENITALS--

09:47.454 --> 09:51.224
GYNECOLOGISTS
AND UROLOGISTS AND...

09:54.361 --> 09:56.997
YOU KNOW,
IT SEEMS TO ME

09:57.097 --> 10:02.169
THAT YOU'RE TAKING ALL
OF THIS TO AN EXTREMELY
INTIMATE REALM

10:02.269 --> 10:03.804
AND YOU'RE SAYING
TO ME,

10:03.904 --> 10:06.373
"I'M EXTREMELY
VULNERABLE HERE.

10:06.473 --> 10:09.076
HELP ME HERE...

10:09.176 --> 10:10.844
WHERE IT HURTS."

10:10.944 --> 10:13.080
( sighs )

10:17.317 --> 10:19.386
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:19.486 --> 10:22.189
( exhales )
WHAT GETS ME IS THAT...

10:22.289 --> 10:25.225
I-- I LAY IT OUT FOR YOU.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.395
ALL I WANT IS FOR YOU
TO GIVE ME THE--

10:28.495 --> 10:30.731
THE GINA TREATMENT,
TO GET IN THERE

10:30.831 --> 10:33.266
WITH YOUR COLD
ANALYTICAL SCALPEL,

10:33.366 --> 10:35.335
AND GET SOME PERSPECTIVE,

10:35.435 --> 10:37.537
SAY, "TRY THIS, PAUL.
TRY THAT."

10:37.637 --> 10:40.373
WHAT I DIDN'T EXPECT
WAS THAT,

10:40.473 --> 10:42.075
YOU KNOW, THAT YOU'D
GIVE UP ON ME,

10:42.175 --> 10:45.312
- THAT YOU'D TELL ME
TO FIND HER A NEW THERAPIST.
- GIVE UP ON YOU?

10:45.412 --> 10:47.180
YOU SUGGEST
A COURSE OF ACTION.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.417
WHEN THAT FAILS, YOU SAY
TO ME, "HEY, YOU DID IT.
DON'T COME BLAMING ME."

10:50.517 --> 10:54.121
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
I CONVINCED YOU TO DO
SOMETHING DESTRUCTIVE?

10:54.221 --> 10:55.889
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.825
IT SEEMS
LIKE A DISTRACTION

10:57.925 --> 11:00.894
FROM TALKING ABOUT
YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT HER,
BUT OKAY.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.231
LET'S START BY LOOKING
AT HOW YOU'RE CONDUCTING
HER THERAPY,

11:04.331 --> 11:07.134
WHICH SEEMS TO ME
IMPULSIVE, UNORGANIZED,

11:07.234 --> 11:09.970
AND IF I'M HONEST,
VERY PROBLEMATIC.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.604
OH REALLY?
DOES IT NOW?

11:11.705 --> 11:13.540
WHENEVER I TRY
TO TALK ABOUT THIS,

11:13.640 --> 11:15.608
YOU UNLEASH ALL
THIS AGGRESSION

11:15.709 --> 11:18.611
TO SHOW ME THIS AREA
IS OFF-LIMITS.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.480
"TOUCH THIS,
I'LL BURN IT DOWN."

11:20.580 --> 11:22.750
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL DEAL WITH IT.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.186
( chuckles )

11:26.286 --> 11:28.255
RIGHT. RIGHT.

11:30.557 --> 11:33.526
YOU REMEMBER I WAS
TALKING ABOUT ALEX,
THE FIGHTER-PILOT GUY--

11:33.626 --> 11:35.595
OH GOD, PAUL,
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.031
- WHAT?
- YOU SAY,
"LET'S TALK ABOUT LAURA,"

11:38.131 --> 11:40.834
AND THEN YOU BRING UP ALEX,
OR ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF

11:40.934 --> 11:42.602
SO LONG AS IT'S NOT LAURA.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.172
THIS IS ABOUT LAURA.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.376
ALEX, THE FIGHTER PILOT...

11:50.510 --> 11:52.379
MET LAURA.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.147
- HOW?
- AFTER A SESSION,

11:54.247 --> 11:56.216
WE HAD THIS TALK
ABOUT STOPPING THERAPY.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.618
THE SESSION ENDED
AND SHE WOULDN'T LEAVE.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.921
SHE WANTED EXTRA TIME.
I TOLD HER I COULDN'T,

12:01.021 --> 12:03.723
THAT I HAD AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THE UROLOGIST--

12:03.824 --> 12:06.393
- YOU DIDN'T TELL HER THAT?
- OF COURSE I DIDN'T
TELL HER THAT.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.862
I SAID I HAD AN APPOINTMENT.
ANYWAY SHE STORMED OUT,

12:08.962 --> 12:11.298
AND LO AND BEHOLD,
WHO DOES SHE MEET?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.732
ALEX.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.968
HE WAS THERE AND YOU HAD
A CONFLICTING APPOINTMENT?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.904
HE WAS A DAY EARLY
BY MISTAKE,

12:17.004 --> 12:20.440
WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE--
BECAUSE THIS GUY IS SUCH
A MILITARY...

12:20.540 --> 12:23.043
PERFECTIONIST MACHINE.

12:23.143 --> 12:26.579
HE CAN PROBABLY TELL
THE TIME BY TRIANGULATING
THE STARS OR SOMETHING.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.182
ANYWAY, HE FORGOT
WHAT DAY IT WAS.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.051
SO HE COMES BACK
THE NEXT AFTERNOON,

12:31.151 --> 12:34.421
TELLS ME THAT
THEY MET AND NOW...

12:34.521 --> 12:36.756
AND NOW THEY'RE DATING.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.363
YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY?

12:43.463 --> 12:46.599
- UH--
- BECAUSE I DON'T.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.468
NO, IT'S NOT FUNNY.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.003
IT'S CURIOUS, I GUESS.

12:50.103 --> 12:53.573
WHAT'S SO-- WHAT'S SO
CURIOUSLY FUNNY ABOUT IT?

12:53.673 --> 12:55.408
I-I-- I DON'T KNOW.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.812
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE
AND LET ME FIGURE OUT
WHAT I'M THINKING.

12:58.912 --> 13:02.482
I-- IT MADE ME SMILE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

13:06.686 --> 13:07.754
HMM.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.556
THEY'RE DATING.

13:09.656 --> 13:10.757
DATING?

13:10.858 --> 13:12.860
SHE WENT OUT WITH HIM
TO GET BACK AT ME.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.361
I PUSHED HER INTO IT.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.597
YOU DON'T SEE THAT?

13:17.697 --> 13:19.499
I REJECT HER UNEQUIVOCALLY.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.936
AND THE NEXT MINUTE
SHE'S HITTING ON
THE NEAREST GUY,

13:23.036 --> 13:26.106
I MEAN, A GUY LITERALLY
ON MY OWN DOORSTEP.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.441
THAT'S NOT
A REACTION TO ME?

13:28.541 --> 13:31.078
WHY WOULD IT BE?

13:31.178 --> 13:34.915
BECAUSE SHE KNEW
ALEX WOULD TELL ME.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.917
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

13:37.017 --> 13:40.820
ISN'T IT A REACTION
AGAINST HER BOYFRIEND?
THE MAN SHE'S GOING TO MARRY?

13:43.790 --> 13:46.459
WHY ARE YOU
THE BETRAYED MAN HERE?

13:48.862 --> 13:50.463
( sighs )

13:57.204 --> 14:00.207
WHICH WOULD BE
THE WORSE SITUATION--

14:01.574 --> 14:05.612
IF YOU REALIZED THAT YOU
WERE THE CENTER OF LAURA'S LIFE,

14:05.712 --> 14:08.882
AND THAT SHE WAS DATING
ANOTHER MAN TO GET AT YOU...

14:10.183 --> 14:14.221
OR IF THE TRANSFERENCE
SIMPLY FADED,

14:14.321 --> 14:17.824
AND SHE WAS BACK
TO VIEWING YOU AS
A THERAPIST,

14:17.925 --> 14:21.094
SHE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
DURING SESSIONS--
THAT'S IT?

14:21.194 --> 14:22.195
HMM.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.231
DO YOU THINK I'M
AN EGOMANIAC?

14:24.331 --> 14:27.167
NO, I'M ASKING WHICH WOULD
BE THE WORSE SITUATION.

14:27.267 --> 14:30.037
LOOK, I DON'T
GET OFF ON BEING
WORSHIPPED BY MY PATIENTS,

14:30.137 --> 14:32.872
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
IN SOME KIND OF--

14:32.973 --> 14:34.874
SOME KIND OF A CULT.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.244
IF HER FEELINGS
WERE TO CHANGE,

14:37.344 --> 14:39.112
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
A SENSE OF LOSS?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.181
HMM.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.251
PRETTY CLEAR HOW YOU
WANT ME TO ANSWER THIS, GINA.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.019
NO.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.155
DO YOU NOT GET
THAT I'M CONCERNED

14:48.255 --> 14:50.190
ABOUT THE RIGHT
AND THE WRONG
OF THIS,

14:50.290 --> 14:52.159
AS IT AFFECTS
ALL MY PATIENTS?

14:52.259 --> 14:54.727
YOU'RE VERY CONCERNED.
I CAN TELL THAT.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.230
BUT YOU KNOW,

14:57.330 --> 15:01.301
SOMETIMES HELPING A PATIENT
VIEW THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY,

15:01.401 --> 15:04.571
IT'S A POWERFUL EXPERIENCE.
IT'S A LITTLE ADDICTIVE.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.807
IT'S A POWERFUL EXPERIENCE
BECAUSE IT CONTRIBUTES

15:07.907 --> 15:09.509
TO SOMEBODY'S WELL-BEING.

15:09.609 --> 15:13.246
IT'S NOT ABOUT
AN INFLATED SENSE
OF POWER.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.648
DO YOU THINK I'M
ADDICTED TO POWER?

15:15.748 --> 15:18.185
OKAY.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.853
HOW--

15:20.954 --> 15:22.922
HOW DOES LAURA SEE YOU?

15:23.023 --> 15:25.158
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WHEN SHE LOOKS AT YOU,

15:25.258 --> 15:27.260
- WHAT DOES SHE SEE?
- WHY?

15:27.360 --> 15:28.795
BEAR WITH ME.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.930
( exhales )

15:31.031 --> 15:33.566
WHAT DOES SHE SEE?
HMM.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.834
( clears throat )

15:34.934 --> 15:37.470
SHE SEES...

15:37.570 --> 15:39.206
A MAN,

15:39.306 --> 15:40.974
OBVIOUSLY,

15:41.074 --> 15:43.676
A LOT OLDER THAN SHE IS,

15:43.776 --> 15:47.547
UM, AN AUTHORITATIVE,
STRONG MAN.

15:47.647 --> 15:50.617
SHE THINKS IF SHE
COULD GET CLOSE TO HIM,

15:50.717 --> 15:54.787
THAT SHE COULD
MAYBE TAKE ON SOME
OF HIS STRENGTH.

15:54.887 --> 15:58.058
AT THE SAME TIME,
SHE'S WAITING FOR HIM
TO DISAPPOINT HER,

15:58.158 --> 16:00.393
BECAUSE SOMEWHERE
DOWN THE LINE,

16:00.493 --> 16:04.764
INEVITABLY THAT'S--
THAT'S HER STORY WITH MEN.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.399
WHAT ELSE?

16:06.499 --> 16:08.335
SHE THINKS THAT I WON'T
BE INTERESTED IN HER

16:08.435 --> 16:10.270
UNLESS SHE OFFERS
HERSELF SEXUALLY.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.606
SHE ASSOCIATES CONCERN
FOR HER AS A WOMAN

16:13.706 --> 16:15.275
WITH SEX.

16:15.375 --> 16:20.180
FOR HER, SEX IS
A CURRENCY THAT SHE USES

16:20.280 --> 16:25.118
TO PAY FOR EMOTIONAL
PROTECTION FROM MEN.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.387
DON'T ANALYZE,
JUST DESCRIBE.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.889
- WHERE'S THIS GOING, GINA?
- JUST STAY WITH IT.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.592
OKAY, UM...

16:32.692 --> 16:34.994
SHE THINKS I'M A COWARD,

16:35.095 --> 16:37.430
WHICH IS A BIT
OF A TURN-OFF.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.333
SHE BELIEVES THAT I'M
TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH HER,

16:40.433 --> 16:43.336
THAT I THINK ALL THE REST
OF MY PATIENTS ARE A DRAG,

16:43.436 --> 16:46.606
AND THAT I CAN'T WAIT
FOR HER SESSION.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.476
I ASSUME SHE...

16:49.576 --> 16:52.245
I ASSUME SHE
FINDS ME ATTRACTIVE.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.282
OTHERWISE,
WHY WOULD SHE--

16:55.382 --> 16:58.818
( sighs )
ISN'T THIS ENOUGH?

16:58.918 --> 17:02.589
NOW YOU DESCRIBE HER--

17:02.689 --> 17:04.357
HOW YOU SEE HER.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.459
I WOULD SAY,

17:06.559 --> 17:09.796
AN HYSTERICAL DISORDER
OF SOME SORT--

17:09.896 --> 17:11.331
DON'T ANALYZE, DESCRIBE.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.466
DID YOU MEAN WHAT--
WHAT DOES SHE LOOK LIKE?

17:13.566 --> 17:15.235
- YES.
- OKAY.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.670
WELL, IF ONE HAD
TO PICK HER OUT OF
A CROWD, I'D SAY THAT--

17:17.770 --> 17:20.373
NO NO, IF YOU HAD
TO PICK HER OUT OF CROWD.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.675
GOD, YOU ARE SUCH
A STICKLER. OKAY.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.577
SHE'S 30.

17:26.012 --> 17:29.249
SHE'S--
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.917
MM-HMM.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.486
GREAT SMILE...

17:34.887 --> 17:36.956
INQUISITIVE LOOK
IN HER EYE,

17:37.056 --> 17:41.328
REALLY SHARP,
VERY SMART.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.430
SHE'S GOT THIS GREAT
LAUGH THAT JUST...

17:43.530 --> 17:46.866
PSSHT, JUST BUBBLES UP
OUT OF HER.

17:46.966 --> 17:50.437
IT COMES FROM NOWHERE,
LIKE QUICKSILVER.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.273
SHE'S CHILDISH, I'D SAY.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.776
NO, NOT CHILDISH--
CHILDLIKE.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.878
VULNERABLE.

17:58.978 --> 18:03.816
MAKES YOU WANT
TO HOLD HER.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.653
SHE'S FASCINATED
WITH SEX--

18:06.753 --> 18:08.388
WELL, WITH THE POWER
OF SEX,

18:08.488 --> 18:10.757
AS IF SHE WERE
A TEENAGER

18:10.857 --> 18:13.126
WHO'S JUST
DISCOVERED IT.

18:13.226 --> 18:17.197
ALWAYS-- ALWAYS
MAKES REFERENCE TO IT.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.667
VIVID SEXUAL EXPERIENCES
THAT, I GOTTA SAY,

18:20.767 --> 18:23.503
ARE VERY POETIC
SOMETIMES.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.372
HMM.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.480
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT A SUMMER
AFTER HER MOTHER DIED.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.548
SHE WAS 15

18:35.648 --> 18:38.050
AND SHE WENT TO LIVE
WITH THIS COUPLE
IN SAN DIEGO--

18:38.151 --> 18:39.752
FRIENDS OF HER FATHER.

18:39.852 --> 18:44.524
AND SHE FELL
IN LOVE WITH THIS GUY,
MUCH OLDER THAN HER.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.161
IT WAS AN ESCAPE, I THINK,
FROM HER FATHER

18:48.261 --> 18:52.232
WHO WAS REALLY
DEPRESSED AND SAD

18:52.332 --> 18:55.302
AFTER THE DEATH
OF HIS WIFE.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.372
THAT CAN BE PRETTY
HORRIBLE, YOU KNOW?

18:59.472 --> 19:02.675
A CHILD TAKING CARE
OF A PARENT.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.011
LIKE YOU DID AFTER
YOUR MOTHER'S BREAKDOWN.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.180
HMM.

19:07.280 --> 19:11.017
NOTHING WORSE
THAN A KID PLAYING PARENT

19:11.117 --> 19:14.187
TO A FATHER, OR MOTHER.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.656
IT'S UNNATURAL.
IT REVERSES THE ORDER
OF THINGS.

19:16.756 --> 19:20.026
IT'S LIKE A KIND
OF DEATH, I SUPPOSE.

19:20.126 --> 19:23.363
FOR YOU, IT WAS
AFTER YOUR FATHER
RAN OFF WITH HIS PATIENT.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.432
OH, YOU KEEP COMING BACK
TO THAT ALL THE TIME.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.634
I'M TRYING TO FIND THE ROOTS
OF YOUR CONNECTION TO LAURA.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.102
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH MY FATHER.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.339
LAURA IS THE ONE
RE-ENACTING,

19:32.439 --> 19:36.175
NOT ME. LAURA'S
RE-ENACTING THIS...

19:36.276 --> 19:37.944
ESCAPE.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.112
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
I AM TO HER.

19:40.213 --> 19:43.149
ESCAPE FROM WHAT?
HER BOYFRIEND, HER WEDDING?

19:43.250 --> 19:46.486
I'VE TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT
TO HER, THAT...

19:46.586 --> 19:49.722
SHE'S REALLY
MAKING ME INTO...

19:49.822 --> 19:51.658
ANOTHER DAVID.

19:51.758 --> 19:55.228
NOT-- NOT YOUR DAVID,
BUT THE OLDER GUY
FROM THAT COUPLE

19:55.328 --> 19:57.230
THAT TOOK HER IN.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.900
SHE WANTS ME TO BE
THAT GUY... AGAIN.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.769
YOU SURE?

20:02.869 --> 20:05.738
WELL, GOD FORBID
I SHOULD SAY ANYTHING
THAT YOU AGREE WITH, GINA,

20:05.838 --> 20:07.640
NO MATTER HOW CLEARLY
I LAY IT OUT.

20:07.740 --> 20:11.711
HER ATTRACTION TO ME,
HER WANTING TO RUN
AWAY WITH ME,

20:11.811 --> 20:16.716
THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER
THAT'S-- THAT'S DRIVING
THAT IMPULSE.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.987
MAYBE YOU
WANT TO RUN AWAY?

20:21.087 --> 20:22.789
- WHAT?
- ESCAPE FROM KATE,

20:22.889 --> 20:26.993
- FROM YOUR WORK.
- GOD, YOU'RE SO FIXATED
ON YOUR PET THEORIES.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.929
EVERYTHING HAS TO...

20:34.434 --> 20:37.404
DID I TELL YOU THAT...

20:39.105 --> 20:41.374
THAT KATE IS GOING
TO ROME NEXT WEEK

20:41.474 --> 20:43.443
WITH HER
INSURANCE-AGENT
BOYFRIEND?

20:43.543 --> 20:46.145
SHE'S THE ONE
THAT'S RUNNING, NOT ME.

20:46.245 --> 20:50.350
I TOLD HER, "FINE,
YOU KNOW, GET-- JUST
GET THE HELL OUT.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.985
I DON'T WANT TO-- I...

20:53.085 --> 20:55.588
I DON'T WANT
TO LOOK AT YOU."

20:57.424 --> 20:59.359
I-- WE DON'T LIVE
TOGETHER, ANYWAY.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.761
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:01.861 --> 21:04.831
I SLEEP IN THE OFFICE.
( chuckles )

21:04.931 --> 21:08.000
DURING THE DAY, WE ACT
LIKE EVERYTHING IS FINE,

21:08.100 --> 21:11.971
BUT AT NIGHT, I'M--

21:12.071 --> 21:13.606
I'M ON THE COUCH.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.376
- SINCE WHEN?
- THE LAST FOUR NIGHTS.

21:16.476 --> 21:20.580
I BROUGHT IN MY BLANKETS
AND MY CLOTHES.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.949
HOW ARE THE KIDS
TAKING THIS?

21:23.049 --> 21:26.118
ROSIE DIDN'T COME HOME
ON TUESDAY.

21:26.218 --> 21:29.155
SAID SHE'D BE BACK LATE,
BUT...

21:29.255 --> 21:30.923
IN THE MORNING
SHE WASN'T THERE.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.426
SHE CLAIMED
THAT SHE SLEPT OVER
AT SOME FRIEND'S.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.495
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS?

21:35.595 --> 21:37.964
IAN HAD A WEEK
OFF FROM COLLEGE.
HE DIDN'T EVEN CALL,

21:38.064 --> 21:39.532
DIDN'T COME BACK.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.402
GOT BACK AFTER WORK YESTERDAY
AND KATE ANNOUNCED THAT,

21:42.502 --> 21:46.339
YOU KNOW, "HEY, I--
I'M GOING OUT."

21:46.439 --> 21:49.642
I SAID, "FINE,
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT."

21:49.742 --> 21:53.279
SO I--
I WENT TO MAKE DINNER

21:53.380 --> 21:56.215
AND... ( sighs )

21:56.315 --> 21:58.618
THERE WAS NO FOOD
IN THE KITCHEN.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.820
I WENT TO THE FRIDGE,
I LOOK IN-- NOTHING.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.555
NOT EVEN AN EGG.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.925
ANYWAY, MAX
AND I ORDERED PIZZAS,
THEN I PUT HIM TO BED.

22:06.025 --> 22:09.328
I WAS GONNA SLEEP
IN THE OFFICE, AND THEN
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

22:09.429 --> 22:10.930
"WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS?"

22:11.030 --> 22:12.465
YOU KNOW?

22:12.565 --> 22:15.702
HE'S UP THERE BY HIMSELF,
HE'S ALL ALONE. I--

22:15.802 --> 22:18.971
I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF
TO SLEEP IN THAT BEDROOM,

22:19.071 --> 22:21.508
NOT EVEN FOR HIS SAKE.

22:21.608 --> 22:24.877
I FIND THAT BEDROOM
KIND OF...

22:24.977 --> 22:28.715
( sighs )
REPULSIVE.

22:28.815 --> 22:31.283
I WAS ASLEEP FOR
A WHILE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TIME IT WAS,

22:31.384 --> 22:35.054
AND I WAKE UP

22:35.154 --> 22:37.724
AND I HEAR
THIS VOICE SAYING,

22:37.824 --> 22:39.626
"DADDY."

22:39.726 --> 22:43.129
AND MAX IS THERE, YOU KNOW?
JUST STANDING AT THE DOOR.

22:43.229 --> 22:46.165
HE ASKED ME IF I
COULD SLEEP WITH HIM,

22:46.265 --> 22:49.436
AND I SAID, "SURE."

22:49.536 --> 22:52.605
HE HASN'T DONE THAT
SINCE HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.342
I GUESS THAT'S THE ANSWER
TO YOUR QUESTION

22:56.443 --> 22:58.745
IS THE KIDS
KNOW EVERYTHING.

23:02.515 --> 23:05.485
ANYWAY, SHE'S-- SHE'S
LEAVING IN THREE DAYS.

23:05.585 --> 23:09.922
AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST REALLY.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.991
HOW IS IT FOR THE BEST?

23:12.091 --> 23:14.293
IT'S NOT FOR THE BEST.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.629
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.466
IT'S PAINFUL.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.734
BUT IN A WAY,
YOU'RE FREE...

23:21.834 --> 23:25.872
TO GO THROUGH
WHATEVER IT IS WITH LAURA.

23:25.972 --> 23:30.176
I WANTED
MY WIFE TO LEAVE ME
FOR A SALESMAN?

23:30.276 --> 23:32.178
MAYBE NOT,
BUT IT'S CONVENIENT.

23:32.278 --> 23:35.848
CONVENIENT?
SHE'S FLYING TO ROME TO
FUCK AN INSURANCE SALESMAN,

23:35.948 --> 23:37.216
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

23:37.316 --> 23:39.486
- IS THAT REALLY WHAT HE IS?
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.854
HE'S A-- RUNS AN EMPLOYMENT
AGENCY OR SOMETHING.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.724
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
CHAIN HER TO THE BED?

23:44.824 --> 23:49.128
TRACK EVERY MOVE SHE MAKES
LIKE THAT GUY I HAVE
IN THERAPY, JAKE?

23:49.228 --> 23:53.299
OR ALEX WHO-- YOU KNOW,
WHOSE WIFE GRINDS HER TEETH
IN HER SLEEP

23:53.399 --> 23:55.468
AND WAKES UP
THE NEXT DAY AND SAYS,

23:55.568 --> 23:57.470
"THE MARRIAGE IS OVER.
I'M LEAVING"?

23:57.570 --> 23:59.606
YOU KEEP BRINGING
PATIENTS INTO THIS.

23:59.706 --> 24:02.241
MY WIFE IS RUNNING OFF,
BUT APPARENTLY

24:02.341 --> 24:05.678
IT'S NOT MY WIFE.
REALLY, IT'S ME--
ACCORDING TO YOU.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.047
SINCE I'M MY FATHER,
IT MUST BE ME.

24:13.052 --> 24:16.589
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
SINCE OUR FIRST SESSION

24:16.689 --> 24:21.327
WHY YOU CAME TO ME--
ME, SPECIFICALLY.

24:21.427 --> 24:23.763
OH-- I REMEMBER
ON OUR FIRST VISIT,

24:23.863 --> 24:26.432
YOU SAID THAT YOU FELT
LIKE YOU WERE CUTTING CORNERS,

24:26.533 --> 24:29.702
YOU-- YOU "HAVE NO PATIENCE
FOR YOUR PATIENTS."

24:29.802 --> 24:31.804
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

24:31.904 --> 24:36.976
AND THAT, IF THEY KNEW
WHAT YOU REALLY THOUGHT
ABOUT THEM,

24:37.076 --> 24:38.845
THEY'D STOP COMING.

24:38.945 --> 24:41.714
I'M WONDERING IF MAYBE
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT--
FOR THEM TO STOP COMING?

24:41.814 --> 24:43.883
- WHY WOULD I WANT THAT, GINA?
- NOT LITERALLY,

24:43.983 --> 24:47.687
- ON AN UNCONSCIOUS LEVEL.
- OH, UNCONSCIOUS.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.590
MAYBE YOU WANT TO TRANSFER
YOUR PATIENTS TO ME.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.426
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?

24:54.527 --> 24:57.129
IT'S NOT A REAL OPTION.
IT'S A WISH.

24:57.229 --> 25:01.300
YOU COULD DUMP YOUR PATIENTS
ON ME-- YOUR PROBLEMS.

25:01.400 --> 25:04.837
WHEN I SUGGESTED THAT WE FIND
ANOTHER THERAPIST FOR LAURA,

25:04.937 --> 25:07.106
YOU IMMEDIATELY ASSUMED
THAT I WOULD TREAT HER.

25:07.206 --> 25:10.777
AND THEN YOU WENT DOWN
THE LIST-- YOU DESCRIBED
EACH PATIENT.

25:10.877 --> 25:13.212
BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT
THESE SESSIONS ARE FOR?

25:13.312 --> 25:16.649
IT FELT LIKE YOU
WERE PREPARING ME
METAPHORICALLY

25:16.749 --> 25:19.552
FOR THE DAY WHEN
YOU HAND THEM OVER--
WHEN YOU SAY, "HERE,

25:19.652 --> 25:22.288
THEIR PROBLEMS
ARE NOT MY PROBLEMS.

25:22.388 --> 25:23.856
I HAVE TO LEAVE."

25:23.956 --> 25:26.392
OH YEAH, I'M GONNA
RUN OFF TO THE CARIBBEAN

25:26.492 --> 25:29.061
AND I'M GONNA BE SIPPING
COCKTAILS WITH LAURA

25:29.161 --> 25:32.632
AND SCUBA DIVING.
I MEAN, WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU ON ABOUT?

25:32.732 --> 25:34.867
I'VE JUST TOOK ON THREE
MORE NEW PATIENTS.

25:34.967 --> 25:38.470
YOU SAID YOU DID THAT
TO PROVE TO YOURSELF THAT
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

25:38.571 --> 25:41.540
THAT COUPLE-- YOU SAID
YOU DON'T CARE IF THEY
EVER COME BACK.

25:41.641 --> 25:44.811
YOU DON'T LIKE
THE NAVY PILOT.

25:44.911 --> 25:49.181
AND SOMETIMES IT SEEMS YOU'RE
NOT THAT UPSET ABOUT KATE.

25:49.281 --> 25:51.117
WHAT?

25:51.217 --> 25:52.885
NOT ALWAYS--

25:52.985 --> 25:55.187
SOMETIMES.

26:01.994 --> 26:05.564
MAYBE ALL THESE THINGS
THAT SHOULD BE BAD

26:05.665 --> 26:07.399
ARE REALLY OKAY.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.969
AND THEN THERE'S ME.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.104
YOU'RE USING ME
AS YOUR ACCOMPLICE--

26:12.204 --> 26:14.807
NOT IN A PRACTICAL WAY,

26:14.907 --> 26:17.143
BUT EMOTIONALLY, TO HELP
YOU MOVE ON FROM THEM.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.680
THAT WAY YOU'RE FREE
TO BE WITH LAURA.

26:25.217 --> 26:28.655
YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO THAT.

26:28.755 --> 26:32.358
I MEAN, WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:32.458 --> 26:33.993
IS THIS WHAT
YOU CALL HELP?

26:34.093 --> 26:35.862
'CAUSE THAT'S WHY
I CAME HERE, GINA.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.097
I CAME HERE
FOR YOU TO HELP ME.

26:38.197 --> 26:39.531
I KEEP SAYING THIS.

26:39.632 --> 26:42.368
BUT THROUGH SOME MISGUIDED
LINE OF REASONING,

26:42.468 --> 26:45.504
THROUGH SOME NARCISSISTIC
NEED OF YOURS

26:45.604 --> 26:48.775
TO SAVE THE DAY,
TO PUT YOURSELF AT
THE FRONT AND THE CENTER,

26:48.875 --> 26:50.643
WE'VE ENDED UP HERE--

26:50.743 --> 26:52.544
IN THIS SAME PLACE

26:52.645 --> 26:56.082
JUST TO CONFIRM THAT YOU,
GINA, ARE RIGHT--

26:56.182 --> 26:58.050
AS ALWAYS.

27:06.492 --> 27:09.061
MAYBE I MISJUDGED YOU,
I DON'T KNOW.

27:09.161 --> 27:12.699
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
BETTER THAN THIS.

27:15.101 --> 27:17.303
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO SAY
YOU REALLY SOMETIMES ARE

27:17.403 --> 27:20.539
SO INFURIATING.
THE WAY YOU KEEP COMING BACK
TO YOUR PET THEORIES,

27:20.639 --> 27:22.508
YOU KNOW?
MY FATHER...

27:22.608 --> 27:24.944
KATE.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.858
I GUESS I'D BETTER GO.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.559
HAVE A GOOD WEEK,
PAUL.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.428
YOU TOO.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.449
( theme music playing )
