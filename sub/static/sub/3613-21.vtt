00:23.273 --> 00:25.025
Ow, damn it!

00:25.942 --> 00:27.444
It's all right, Daisy.

00:27.611 --> 00:31.823
Oh, Leo, thank God it's you.
I have been so scared.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.660
Look, you just have to stay strong
a little longer and then you'll be safe.

00:35.827 --> 00:39.789
But he's out there, Leo.
He's going to find me.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.751
I've seen what he can do,
his powers.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.803
How did you do that?

00:54.304 --> 00:57.307
- Who are you people?
- You just have to trust me, Daisy.

00:57.474 --> 01:00.518
But why me, Leo?
I still don't understand.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.604
You have a very special future
ahead of you.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.105
That's why I wanted you
to come to San Francisco.

01:05.272 --> 01:07.442
I have powerful friends here
who can help you.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.737
- Leo, what if Alec finds me first?
- He won't be able to.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.865
- I've made you invisible to him.
- Hello, Leo.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.700
Been looking all over for you.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.828
I figured you can only be here
for one reason.

01:19.787 --> 01:23.374
Where are you, Daisy?
I know you're close by.

01:23.541 --> 01:27.128
It's okay, Daisy, he can't see you.
Don't say a word, just leave quickly.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.380
Don't listen to him, sweetie.
Don't do it.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.303
- She's already gone, Alec.
- I love her, Leo.

01:35.470 --> 01:39.724
Much like you love your little witch.
What's her name? Piper.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.059
Darklighters aren't capable
of love, Alec.

01:42.226 --> 01:43.686
This one is.

01:43.853 --> 01:47.607
I love Daisy,
and you are keeping me from her.

01:47.773 --> 01:49.108
It was only a couple of days ago,

01:49.275 --> 01:51.527
all I had to do was think about her,
then bang,

01:51.694 --> 01:53.446
I'd be there with her, right there.

01:53.946 --> 01:56.574
Then suddenly she vanishes
from my radar.

01:56.741 --> 02:00.328
Cloaked by a whitelighter.
By you.

02:00.494 --> 02:01.996
Well, if you know I cloaked her,

02:02.163 --> 02:05.416
then you also know that you
won't find her as long as I live.

02:05.583 --> 02:09.627
Yes. Well, I have a solution for that.

02:30.566 --> 02:33.527
I can't believe you're wearing
your bikini on the plane.

02:33.694 --> 02:36.697
Timesaver. We have
all of 48 hours in Cabo.

02:36.864 --> 02:39.366
The minute we land, I'm on the beach
getting all golden brown.

02:39.533 --> 02:41.201
I know, but you're making me
look frumpy.

02:41.368 --> 02:43.537
It's like a sign of the apocalypse.

02:43.704 --> 02:46.749
I practically had to beg the guy
in Accounting to lend us his condo.

02:46.915 --> 02:50.294
There are no warlocks in sight.
Andy finally found out our big secret.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.504
- I'm going to get crazy.
- It's about time.

02:52.671 --> 02:55.048
How long have I been after you
to find some new male blood?

02:55.215 --> 02:59.803
- Preferably tan and buff.
- With limited verbal skills.

02:59.970 --> 03:02.598
- And no strings attached.
- No strings attached.

03:02.764 --> 03:06.059
Stella, we are getting
our groove back.

03:08.353 --> 03:11.398
So speaking of which.
Where's Piper?

03:11.565 --> 03:14.943
I think Piper's gonna be in a
groove-free kind of mode for a while.

03:15.110 --> 03:19.072
- Oh, she's not seriously...
- Taking a vacation from men, yep.

03:19.239 --> 03:20.907
Afraid of falling in love again,
I think.

03:21.074 --> 03:23.660
So while we're partying all weekend,
what is she gonna be doing?

03:23.827 --> 03:26.079
I don't know. The last I checked,
she was in the attic

03:26.246 --> 03:29.332
searching for a suitcase
to carry her books in.

03:29.499 --> 03:30.792
Books? What kind of books?

03:30.959 --> 03:33.420
The kind they make
into Kevin Costner movies.

03:33.587 --> 03:36.673
Oh, no!
We've got to stop the insanity.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.175
Maybe we should just let her be.

03:38.341 --> 03:41.094
I mean, we're not the ones who
fell in love with a warlock, a ghost,

03:41.261 --> 03:43.054
a geographically undesirable
handyman

03:43.221 --> 03:46.641
- and a very dorky grad student.
- Maybe she's just in a slump.

03:46.808 --> 03:47.893
It happens.

03:48.393 --> 03:52.606
All right, it happens to Piper a lot,
but celibacy is not the answer.

03:52.772 --> 03:55.150
A couple of dates not picking up
the check, that's a slump.

03:55.317 --> 03:57.444
This is more like a sucking void.

03:59.237 --> 04:01.573
Prue, Phoebe.

04:09.581 --> 04:11.416
Leo?

06:08.574 --> 06:11.493
- Be careful.
- I am being careful.

06:11.660 --> 06:13.537
I can't believe you knew.

06:13.704 --> 06:16.290
The fact that our handyman,
the man I was dating

06:16.456 --> 06:18.500
was supernatural,
just happen to slip your mind?

06:18.667 --> 06:22.504
There was no slipping, okay. I told you,
but you didn't wanna believe me.

06:22.671 --> 06:25.424
- Piper, I wanted...
- But you didn't.

06:25.590 --> 06:27.551
Okay, we gotta...
We gotta get your legs up.

06:27.718 --> 06:29.928
Don't worry about me.
There's someone...

06:30.262 --> 06:32.431
- We have to get the arrow out.
- No, don't touch it.

06:32.597 --> 06:33.890
It's tipped with poison.

06:34.057 --> 06:37.227
How are we supposed to pull it out
if we can't touch it?

06:37.394 --> 06:40.021
You came to the right girl.
Here. You ready?

06:48.697 --> 06:50.740
Okay, I brought everything
that I could find.

06:50.907 --> 06:53.451
I just didn't know what to use on a...
What is he again?

06:53.618 --> 06:55.662
- A whitelighter.
- Yeah, they're sort of like...

06:55.829 --> 06:58.039
You know how Peter Pan
has Tinker Bell?

06:58.206 --> 07:00.917
They're sort of like that.
Only minus the tutu and the wings.

07:01.167 --> 07:03.920
- He guides witches.
- And future whitelighters.

07:04.087 --> 07:07.257
- That's why I came to you.
- You should have told me.

07:07.424 --> 07:09.968
- Well...
- I should have told you.

07:12.929 --> 07:15.140
Oh, did that hurt? Good.

07:15.682 --> 07:17.684
Look, there's a woman. Daisy.

07:17.851 --> 07:19.769
You have to protect her
from the darklighter.

07:19.936 --> 07:22.147
- A darklighter, that's what shot you?
- Yeah.

07:22.313 --> 07:24.899
They... They seduce innocent women.

07:25.066 --> 07:27.527
Their goal is to create evil
through reproduction.

07:27.694 --> 07:32.156
- Great, generation 666.
- Only he broke the rules.

07:32.323 --> 07:35.868
He fell in love with one of his victims.
A human.

07:36.786 --> 07:38.454
And she loved him back.

07:38.621 --> 07:41.040
Until she found out
who he really was, right?

07:41.207 --> 07:43.126
Piper, you have every right
to be mad at me.

07:43.292 --> 07:46.003
Thanks for the permission.
I'll get some more gauze.

07:47.797 --> 07:49.882
Please, you have to find Daisy
before he does.

07:50.049 --> 07:53.052
Otherwise she won't be able to do
the good that she's destined to,

07:53.219 --> 07:55.138
and she won't be able to become
a whitelighter.

07:55.304 --> 07:58.224
- Okay, where is she?
- I don't know.

07:58.391 --> 08:01.769
The last time I saw her,
she was at a mini-mart in the Castro,

08:01.936 --> 08:03.688
headed for her rental car.

08:03.855 --> 08:05.940
If he finds her first,
he'll never let her go. Ever.

08:06.107 --> 08:09.277
Any tips on how to vanquish a
darklighter in case we run into him?

08:09.443 --> 08:13.614
No. Just...
Just don't let him touch you.

08:13.781 --> 08:14.907
His power is in his hands.

08:15.074 --> 08:17.326
And when he chooses to,
he has the touch of death.

08:17.493 --> 08:20.997
And we have the power of three. All
right, call the airline, cancel our tickets.

08:21.163 --> 08:23.290
I'll call Andy, see if
he can help me locate her.

08:23.457 --> 08:25.042
- And Piper should...
- I'll talk to her.

08:25.209 --> 08:28.003
- Someone's gotta stay with Leo.
- Perfect.

08:29.839 --> 08:32.842
- You enjoying this as much as I am?
- What's that?

08:33.008 --> 08:35.635
Oh, you know, the silent treatment,
the cold shoulder.

08:39.347 --> 08:41.933
I know. It's been a week since
Internal Affairs has made a move.

08:42.101 --> 08:44.353
- What are they waiting for?
- I'm not talking about IA.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.980
I'm talking about you and me.

08:46.146 --> 08:48.983
- I got no problems.
- That makes one of us.

08:49.149 --> 08:53.570
IA is on our ass, and I still don't know
why, but I'm pretty damn sure you do.

08:54.238 --> 08:55.739
You feel like sharing?

08:57.533 --> 08:58.992
Homicide, Trudeau.

08:59.159 --> 09:00.452
<i>- Andy, hi. I...
- Hey.</i>

09:01.328 --> 09:04.206
Franklin. How are things
in Forensics?

09:04.373 --> 09:05.416
You can't talk.

09:06.041 --> 09:10.295
No, actually. Why don't you have it
checked out by the FBI lab?

09:10.462 --> 09:14.091
Andy, I really need your help.
It's important. Quake?

09:16.093 --> 09:18.887
Okay, I'll be there.

09:22.224 --> 09:24.518
Franklin's wife had
a baby girl yesterday.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.562
He took a week off.

09:27.729 --> 09:29.648
He call you from the maternity ward?

09:38.156 --> 09:41.034
You don't wanna tell me
what's going on, fine.

09:41.201 --> 09:43.954
Just don't lie to me, okay, partner?

10:00.929 --> 10:02.639
Andy, what's going on?

10:04.266 --> 10:08.186
Internal Affairs is looking into
all my unsolved cases.

10:08.478 --> 10:10.689
All the ones that involve
the supernatural.

10:11.773 --> 10:14.734
All the cases that involve me.

10:15.193 --> 10:17.904
Do you think that they
followed you here?

10:18.279 --> 10:20.490
I wouldn't put it past them.

10:21.741 --> 10:23.743
Andy, if we...

10:23.910 --> 10:28.623
- If I put you in this situation...
- I put me here, Prue.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.500
Yeah, but you had help.

10:33.294 --> 10:36.339
- Can they force you to tell them?
- About you?

10:36.506 --> 10:38.299
I won't.

10:38.883 --> 10:41.386
But we have to be careful
about being seen together.

10:41.552 --> 10:43.680
It has to look like we're still...

10:43.846 --> 10:45.932
...friends.

10:46.933 --> 10:49.185
Andy, we are still friends.

10:49.352 --> 10:50.728
We always will be.

10:53.022 --> 10:55.775
You sure I'm not just someone
who's keeping your secret, Prue?

10:57.360 --> 10:59.278
You know me better than that.

11:03.658 --> 11:05.660
I'm glad I told you.

11:05.827 --> 11:07.245
I am.

11:08.704 --> 11:10.581
So am I.

11:10.748 --> 11:13.459
Now when you need me,
all you have to do is ask.

11:13.626 --> 11:15.836
Well, I am asking.

11:16.003 --> 11:17.630
I need to find someone.

11:17.797 --> 11:21.133
She's in danger, and I have
to get to her before he does.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.885
He?

11:23.469 --> 11:25.429
You know what?
I don't need to know.

11:25.596 --> 11:28.432
Specifics always get me into trouble.

11:28.599 --> 11:30.518
Where was the last place
she was seen?

11:30.684 --> 11:33.270
Headed to her rental car
outside a mini-mart.

11:35.523 --> 11:37.858
Well, we can get the security cameras
from the mini-mart

11:38.025 --> 11:39.318
and surrounding businesses.

11:39.485 --> 11:41.237
See if we can get
the car's license plates

11:41.403 --> 11:43.697
and see if it leads us
to where she's staying.

11:45.449 --> 11:46.700
Thanks.

11:50.037 --> 11:55.584
Leo, I brought you some food
in case you're... You do eat, right?

11:55.751 --> 11:57.753
Yes, Phoebe, I eat.

11:57.920 --> 12:01.090
- How's Piper?
- Oh, you know, she's dealing.

12:01.256 --> 12:05.344
I mean, it's not every day that you find
out the guy you're seeing isn't human.

12:05.511 --> 12:07.805
Although in Piper's case...

12:07.971 --> 12:11.475
I wish she didn't have
to find out about me like this.

12:12.142 --> 12:15.771
Being with her broke the rules,
but not being with her breaks my heart.

12:16.772 --> 12:21.026
You know, Leo, it's not like we rushed
to tell you that we're witches.

12:21.193 --> 12:25.739
I think Piper understands about those
little secrets that we have to keep.

12:27.532 --> 12:30.327
- Any word on Daisy?
- Yes and no.

12:30.494 --> 12:34.498
Prue called. Andy thinks he found out
where Daisy's staying.

12:34.665 --> 12:37.000
They're on their way there now.

12:39.670 --> 12:41.088
I'm sorry, I "m sorry.

12:46.259 --> 12:49.137
It's okay. I know it's bad.

12:50.013 --> 12:53.642
I guess I need to work
on my poker face a little bit, huh?

12:56.102 --> 13:00.315
You know, Leo, didn't you tell me that
whitelighters had the ability to heal?

13:00.482 --> 13:03.401
- Why can't you just...?
- No. My power is for others.

13:03.568 --> 13:06.154
I can't use it on myself.

13:16.289 --> 13:19.834
You know, we just...
We just gotta get you better.

13:20.001 --> 13:22.962
Then you and Piper will have
lots of time to talk about stuff

13:23.129 --> 13:26.633
- when you're well.
- Phoebe, I'm not gonna get better.

13:27.467 --> 13:29.385
That's ridiculous, Leo.
Of course you will.

13:29.552 --> 13:31.763
<i>We just have to find something
in the Book of Shadows...</i>

13:31.930 --> 13:35.517
No, the darklighter's poison
can't be reversed.

13:38.353 --> 13:42.023
It's meant to kill whitelighters.
That's what it's doing.

13:42.190 --> 13:44.984
It's working its way
through my system.

13:46.986 --> 13:49.280
It's just a matter of time.

13:50.114 --> 13:51.824
How much time?

13:52.408 --> 13:54.494
Not much.

13:57.205 --> 13:59.707
I'm gonna die, and there's nothing
you can do about it.

14:02.168 --> 14:08.132
My power is ebbing, and with it,
my ability to cloak Daisy.

14:14.013 --> 14:16.557
We're gonna save you both, Leo.

14:28.944 --> 14:31.572
I have looked everywhere
in this damn book for something,

14:31.739 --> 14:34.784
anything to help Leo, and I can't...

14:36.035 --> 14:38.370
What's that face?
What's the matter?

14:39.914 --> 14:42.291
Leo's in pretty bad shape, Piper.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.878
And he's getting worse.

14:46.045 --> 14:49.465
I know, that's why I need to find
an ointment or a cure or something...

14:49.632 --> 14:52.176
Okay, you need to listen.

14:56.430 --> 14:59.767
This is really hard to say...

15:00.601 --> 15:03.187
...but I think you need to hear it.

15:03.604 --> 15:09.318
I think that you need to learn
to accept the possibility that...

15:10.486 --> 15:14.364
...maybe we're not supposed
to save Leo.

15:15.783 --> 15:18.327
Maybe he's not our innocent.

15:18.911 --> 15:23.290
Maybe we're only meant
to save Daisy.

15:29.463 --> 15:33.300
We have to save him,
whether we're meant to or not.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.738
I got you your favourite.

15:56.072 --> 15:58.116
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

15:59.743 --> 16:02.162
I've missed this. Us.

16:02.829 --> 16:07.459
There is no us, Alec.
Please, stop.

16:07.626 --> 16:08.877
Never.

16:09.044 --> 16:12.130
You're the one, Daisy.
You're mine.

16:12.297 --> 16:15.091
Indian summer.
Do you remember that, Daisy?

16:15.258 --> 16:18.261
When it got so hot in the city
you could barely breathe,

16:18.428 --> 16:19.971
and we sat out on your fire escape

16:20.138 --> 16:23.641
taking turns rubbing ice cubes
down each other's necks

16:23.808 --> 16:25.101
- and backs.
- Stop!

16:25.268 --> 16:27.645
That's when you first said
you loved me.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.315
"Forever, Alec.
I'll love you forever."

16:34.277 --> 16:37.071
Now, is that any way to treat
the man who loves you?

16:37.238 --> 16:40.116
You're not a man.
You're not even human.

16:40.283 --> 16:43.995
Don't make me regret telling you
who I really am.

16:44.329 --> 16:45.997
Don't you get it, Daisy?

16:47.624 --> 16:49.167
I love you.

16:49.334 --> 16:51.836
And now no one can stop us
from being together.

16:52.003 --> 16:53.713
Think about it.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.842
I found you.
What do you think that means?

16:58.468 --> 17:00.011
Yeah, that's right.

17:00.178 --> 17:03.139
I've clipped Leo's wings,
and soon he'll be gone.

17:03.306 --> 17:06.309
So I can find you whenever I want.

17:07.018 --> 17:09.520
Hello? Manager.
Everything okay in there?

17:09.686 --> 17:10.980
I win.

17:11.230 --> 17:16.694
No. You only win if I come willingly,
and I never will.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.613
Then I'll never go away.

17:18.779 --> 17:20.489
Hey, I'm coming in.

17:20.656 --> 17:22.575
No! Don't!

17:22.782 --> 17:24.410
I thought I heard...

17:25.453 --> 17:27.454
Nobody can keep us
apart now, Daisy.

17:27.622 --> 17:29.582
Please, stop!

17:40.551 --> 17:43.179
- You can't run from me!
- Daisy!

17:57.026 --> 17:58.986
What the hell was that?

17:59.153 --> 18:01.322
Welcome to my world.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.245
Hey, Prue's home. She just...

18:08.412 --> 18:10.372
<i>"What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine</i>

18:10.539 --> 18:14.293
<i>- Let our powers cross the line"
- I hear rhyming.</i>

18:14.460 --> 18:17.463
- What are you doing?
- Everything I can.

18:17.629 --> 18:21.341
Look, we know Leo can't heal himself,
but maybe with his powers, I can.

18:21.508 --> 18:24.011
- What are you talking about?
- It's a power-switching spell.

18:24.178 --> 18:25.512
If Leo and I exchange powers,

18:25.679 --> 18:28.015
then I'll have the healing touch
and maybe I can fix him.

18:28.182 --> 18:31.185
- Hey, what's going on?
- You know, the usual.

18:31.351 --> 18:33.145
Made some coffee,
read the newspaper,

18:33.312 --> 18:36.231
walked in on Piper switching powers
with Leo, you know.

18:36.398 --> 18:38.233
I have to save him, Prue.

18:39.276 --> 18:41.069
Okay. Is it safe?

18:41.695 --> 18:44.239
To tell you the truth, I don't really care.
He's slipping away.

18:44.406 --> 18:47.159
And if either one of you has
a better idea, then I'm all ears.

18:47.326 --> 18:49.161
If not, then I'm casting the spell.

18:49.536 --> 18:52.039
And I'd like to do it
with the support of my sisters.

18:53.081 --> 18:54.458
Cast away.

18:59.129 --> 19:00.881
<i>"What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine</i>

19:01.047 --> 19:02.674
<i>Let our powers cross the line</i>

19:02.841 --> 19:06.052
<i>I offer up my gift to share
Switch the powers through the air"</i>

19:08.013 --> 19:10.974
- Did it work?
- I don't know.

19:18.273 --> 19:20.650
- I can't freeze.
- This is a good sign.

19:20.817 --> 19:23.653
The spell must've worked.
Okay, that means Phoebe and I...

19:28.825 --> 19:32.954
Oh, I think I just had one of Phoebe's
premonition thingies.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.166
Really? What did you see?

19:36.958 --> 19:39.127
That shattering.

19:40.336 --> 19:42.088
Kit, no!

19:44.466 --> 19:46.676
Did I just do that?

19:47.844 --> 19:49.637
And I saw it. So...

19:50.096 --> 19:53.224
Okay, you're moving things,
I'm having premonitions

19:53.391 --> 19:55.935
and Piper can't freeze anymore,
which means...

19:56.102 --> 19:57.979
Am I gonna get yelled at?

19:58.146 --> 20:03.026
<i>- It switched all of our powers?
- It's a supernatural Freaky Friday.</i>

20:03.568 --> 20:05.069
You know what,
I'm gonna go get that,

20:05.236 --> 20:10.324
and I'm sure you guys will have all of
this worked out by the time I get back.

20:14.620 --> 20:16.747
Okay, I can do this.

20:16.914 --> 20:18.791
Now heal.

20:20.042 --> 20:22.211
Come on, heal.
Why aren't these working?

20:22.378 --> 20:24.839
Okay, okay, okay. Piper, relax.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.966
Remember when we first got
our own powers,

20:27.133 --> 20:29.343
it took us a while to figure out
how to trigger them.

20:29.510 --> 20:31.304
I'm doing what I always do.

20:31.470 --> 20:35.766
Yes, but maybe you have
to find his trigger, not yours.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.893
Hey, that was Andy.

20:38.060 --> 20:40.646
A new charge came up
on Daisy's credit card report.

20:40.813 --> 20:43.232
She bought a bus ticket
20 minutes ago. She's running again.

20:43.399 --> 20:46.444
If she leaves town, we'll never
be able to find her. Let's go.

20:46.610 --> 20:48.195
Wait. We have to switch
our powers back.

20:48.362 --> 20:51.699
- Not until I heal Leo.
- Piper, we have to go get Daisy.

20:51.866 --> 20:54.493
And I have to heal him.
I'm not losing him again.

20:55.703 --> 20:57.955
Okay, you know what, you stay here.

20:58.122 --> 21:00.708
We have to find Daisy
before the darklighter does.

21:00.875 --> 21:04.253
We'll just have to do it using
each other's powers. Come on.

21:06.839 --> 21:08.757
You wanted to see me?

21:09.341 --> 21:11.010
Sit down.

21:16.682 --> 21:18.600
You make a habit out of showing up
at the scene

21:18.767 --> 21:20.352
before the crime is reported,
inspector?

21:20.853 --> 21:22.479
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:22.646 --> 21:26.817
Motel Capri. No one called
the manager's murder in, Trudeau.

21:26.984 --> 21:28.485
Not until you did.

21:29.611 --> 21:31.864
- I got a tip.
- You're lying.

21:35.909 --> 21:38.954
Witnesses place you
at the scene with a woman.

21:39.121 --> 21:43.041
Five-three or four,
brunette, attractive.

21:43.208 --> 21:45.252
Ring any bells?

21:45.502 --> 21:46.545
Last time I checked,

21:46.712 --> 21:49.840
I didn't have to reveal
my informants to you, Rodriguez.

21:50.007 --> 21:51.717
Maybe not in a court of law,

21:51.883 --> 21:54.011
but last time I checked,
we weren't in one.

21:54.970 --> 21:59.099
This is an IA investigation.
You don't have the same rights.

22:01.435 --> 22:04.521
You have no idea
how much I can hurt you.

22:07.566 --> 22:11.194
Just tell us who you're
covering for, inspector.

22:31.214 --> 22:32.298
Screw you.

22:45.895 --> 22:49.023
Excuse me,
where can I find bus 24?

22:50.108 --> 22:52.110
I told you, I'll always be there
for you, Daisy.

22:58.032 --> 22:59.784
- I'm sorry.
- It's quite all right.

23:01.035 --> 23:05.498
I'm in no hurry. I've got forever.
You care to join me?

23:10.420 --> 23:14.340
- Okay, are you trying to piss me off?
- That's exactly what I'm trying to do.

23:14.507 --> 23:16.217
- Only it's not working.
- How do you know?

23:16.384 --> 23:18.469
Because I don't see anything
flying across the room.

23:18.636 --> 23:20.513
You're gonna need to know
how to use my power

23:20.680 --> 23:22.473
in case the darklighter
shows up, remember?

23:22.640 --> 23:24.976
When I first got my power,
it was anger that triggered it,

23:25.143 --> 23:28.938
- so I need to push your buttons.
- Okay, it's not so easy to break me.

23:29.105 --> 23:31.649
What was it in high school
that the guys started calling you

23:31.816 --> 23:34.068
after they caught you making out
with someone under the bleachers?

23:34.235 --> 23:36.696
- Not gonna work.
- What was that?

23:36.862 --> 23:39.407
Oh, yeah, "Freebie."

23:42.493 --> 23:43.995
Well, class is over.

23:45.413 --> 23:48.124
You know that was just
a rumour, right?

23:52.586 --> 23:54.964
Okay, now it's your turn.
We need a premonition.

23:55.131 --> 23:56.424
- Where's Daisy?
- Do I have to?

23:56.590 --> 24:00.052
The last time I got all woozy and...

24:01.595 --> 24:03.430
Okay, you know,
you guys take for granted

24:03.597 --> 24:07.268
that I'm your Innocent Yellow Pages.
Okay, this takes work.

24:07.434 --> 24:10.020
It is useless, all right.
I am never going to get...

24:13.983 --> 24:18.153
- Do your ears ring when you do that?
- What did you see?

24:19.280 --> 24:21.031
I can't be sure,
because it went by so fast,

24:21.198 --> 24:23.575
but if I were playing odds,
I would say that it was Daisy.

24:23.742 --> 24:26.203
- Where is she?
- Bathroom.

24:28.372 --> 24:30.082
Okay.

24:30.499 --> 24:33.460
I'm gonna be okay.
I can handle this.

24:37.714 --> 24:42.010
- You can't run from me, Daisy.
- Why won't you leave me alone?

24:42.177 --> 24:45.764
Because we can be happy together.
We were once, remember?

24:46.390 --> 24:48.684
All you have to do
is come with me willingly.

24:49.226 --> 24:52.396
And what? Watch while you kill
more innocent people.

24:52.563 --> 24:54.314
You made me do that.

24:54.481 --> 24:57.484
That man would still be alive
if you had just come with me.

24:57.651 --> 25:01.196
That's all I ask,
and the killing will stop.

25:01.571 --> 25:04.241
We can have eternity together.

25:12.582 --> 25:15.961
- I believe this is the ladies' room.
- And this is a private conversation.

25:19.297 --> 25:20.799
Phoebe!

25:22.717 --> 25:24.135
Oops.

25:24.928 --> 25:27.013
Okay, now would be a very good time
to get angry.

25:27.180 --> 25:29.015
I've never used this
on a witch before.

25:29.182 --> 25:32.727
Oh, Grandma's car, fender dented.
You got blamed for it. I did it.

25:36.106 --> 25:38.692
I got grounded for that, Prue.

25:42.946 --> 25:44.864
I've never used this
on a darklighter before.

25:50.078 --> 25:52.080
Oh, God. Is he...?

25:52.872 --> 25:55.250
Daisy. Leo sent us.
We have to take you to him.

25:55.416 --> 25:58.044
Come on, it's okay.

26:10.223 --> 26:14.435
Oh, God, please work.
Come on, work.

26:19.649 --> 26:22.777
- When I die...
- You're not gonna die.

26:23.111 --> 26:25.321
When it happens...

26:27.031 --> 26:31.452
...know this is where
I want to be.

26:38.543 --> 26:40.002
I love you.

26:50.554 --> 26:52.765
Oh, God. He found me again.

26:52.932 --> 26:54.642
- How do you know?
- That's what he does.

26:54.809 --> 26:58.229
He sends me flowers
so I know he's watching.

26:59.814 --> 27:01.524
No, honey, these are for Prue.

27:02.525 --> 27:05.194
They're from Andy.
He needs to see me right away.

27:05.361 --> 27:07.196
Something wrong with his phone?

27:07.363 --> 27:09.865
It's a long story,
but I can't leave you guys.

27:10.199 --> 27:12.868
No, Prue, we'll go up
and check on Leo,

27:13.035 --> 27:16.247
and, you know, remember, I'm the one
with the active power now. Go.

27:16.413 --> 27:18.666
- Are you sure?
- Yes, absolutely. We'll be fine.

27:21.043 --> 27:23.379
Let's go check on Leo.

27:25.756 --> 27:27.591
Piper, we found Daisy and...

27:30.386 --> 27:32.346
I tried.

27:37.726 --> 27:39.603
He's gone.

27:53.033 --> 27:56.787
Daisy, I really don't think this is
the best time for you to be alone.

27:56.954 --> 28:01.083
Without Leo, it's just a matter of time
before Alec finds me again.

28:01.249 --> 28:03.502
- I have to get away.
- No.

28:03.669 --> 28:05.879
My sisters and I
can take care of Alec.

28:06.046 --> 28:10.717
I don't want you to try. Too many
people are dead now because of me.

28:10.884 --> 28:14.054
- And now Leo.
- Honey, that's not your fault.

28:14.221 --> 28:15.514
It doesn't matter.

28:15.680 --> 28:20.268
When Alec finds me again, he's not
gonna let you get in the way either.

28:20.519 --> 28:24.356
It's better off that I leave.
Trust me. I have to go.

28:24.523 --> 28:26.566
Don't you dare.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.612
Leo gave up his life
to bring you here.

28:30.779 --> 28:34.032
If you leave,
Alec will find you for sure,

28:34.199 --> 28:37.077
and Leo's death will mean nothing.

28:37.619 --> 28:40.080
You're not going anywhere.

28:49.172 --> 28:53.635
So I take it we're not here for the
same reason we used in high school.

28:53.968 --> 28:55.970
Unfortunately, no.

28:56.137 --> 28:58.723
Makes me kind of wish
for the good old days.

28:58.890 --> 29:01.267
Yeah, we tried that already.

29:02.227 --> 29:03.478
Prue, I did everything I could

29:03.645 --> 29:06.689
to keep Internal Affairs
from finding out about you,

29:06.856 --> 29:08.733
but there's not much more
I can do after today.

29:08.900 --> 29:10.068
Why? What happened?

29:10.860 --> 29:13.154
I wouldn't tell them
what they wanted to know.

29:13.321 --> 29:16.157
I turned in my shield.
Automatic suspension.

29:17.408 --> 29:20.578
I gotta hand it to Rodriguez,
he's a pit bull.

29:20.745 --> 29:22.914
But when he connects you
to all those unsolved cases,

29:23.081 --> 29:25.041
he's gonna put the heat on you
to get to me.

29:25.208 --> 29:27.043
And unless you're careful,

29:27.210 --> 29:30.213
he's gonna figure out that it's you
and your sisters that he really wants.

29:30.379 --> 29:33.841
Wait, you just got suspended and
you're telling me to watch my back?

29:34.008 --> 29:37.637
Until IA's off my case, it's better
if we're not even seen together.

29:37.970 --> 29:41.224
You don't want them to connect
the dots, believe me.

29:42.850 --> 29:45.144
I can't believe
that you're worried about me

29:45.311 --> 29:48.481
when you're about to lose everything
you ever worked for.

29:50.650 --> 29:55.404
Every one of those unsolved cases
that Rodriguez is tracking down...

29:56.280 --> 29:59.742
...is an innocent life that you
and your sisters helped to save.

29:59.909 --> 30:02.870
What you're doing
is the reason I became a cop.

30:03.913 --> 30:06.207
I guess that's how I do it.

30:08.751 --> 30:11.712
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

30:12.588 --> 30:14.799
Everything happens for a reason.

30:14.965 --> 30:16.759
Remember, you taught me that?

30:22.640 --> 30:24.350
Thanks.

30:30.272 --> 30:32.483
Take care, Prue.

30:43.368 --> 30:45.829
I thought you might like to talk.

30:47.873 --> 30:51.543
He could have stayed with us.
He could have fought harder.

30:52.711 --> 30:55.214
He was in pain. He had to let go.

30:55.380 --> 30:57.633
He didn't have to.
Our magic's never failed before.

30:57.799 --> 30:59.760
I cast the spell.
I took his power.

30:59.927 --> 31:03.472
All he had to do was show me
how to do it, and he never did.

31:04.514 --> 31:08.518
- How can you be mad at him?
- Because it should have worked.

31:09.186 --> 31:13.649
Prue's having premonitions, and
you figured out how to use her power.

31:13.815 --> 31:17.361
Why couldn't I find the trigger?
Why couldn't he just tell me?

31:17.527 --> 31:20.113
Give me his power?

31:26.286 --> 31:27.871
He wanted to live.

31:29.998 --> 31:32.375
He didn't want to leave you.

31:37.589 --> 31:40.717
It's hard to lose someone you love.

32:01.029 --> 32:03.114
I love you, Leo.

32:28.890 --> 32:30.641
I found it.

32:30.808 --> 32:34.437
Leo, I love you.
Can you hear me?

32:34.604 --> 32:36.689
I love you, Leo. Please hear me.

32:48.534 --> 32:51.954
- Piper!
- Oh, thank God.

32:52.997 --> 32:57.168
I tried so hard,
and I couldn't make it work before.

32:57.335 --> 33:01.130
- Why didn't you tell me?
- That love was the trigger?

33:01.297 --> 33:04.091
You had to find that out
on your own.

33:05.301 --> 33:07.094
Why couldn't you tell me?

33:07.261 --> 33:11.682
I don't know. I was afraid. I was afraid
if I admitted how I really felt

33:11.849 --> 33:13.559
that I would hurt more
if I lost you.

33:13.726 --> 33:16.479
I'm so sorry.
I should have said it before.

33:17.855 --> 33:19.565
It's better late than never.

33:30.743 --> 33:35.164
- Leo? Oh, my God. How did you...?
- There's no time to explain.

33:35.331 --> 33:37.791
You've been out of the cloak
too long. Alec can find her.

33:37.958 --> 33:39.627
Where's Prue?
We need to get her back here

33:39.793 --> 33:42.421
and we need to find a spell
to vanquish darklighter.

33:42.588 --> 33:43.797
A power-of-three spell.

33:43.964 --> 33:46.467
Okay, I think she has
her cell phone on her.

33:48.177 --> 33:49.344
No!

33:51.722 --> 33:54.475
- All right, no more tricks, ladies.
- Let her go, Alec.

33:54.641 --> 33:58.312
I don't think so. I have what you love,
you've got what I love.

33:58.479 --> 34:01.565
Care to trade? Don't do that.

34:01.732 --> 34:03.275
I will kill her if I have to.

34:03.817 --> 34:06.320
You still think I'm incapable
of love, Leo?

34:06.486 --> 34:08.155
You want to see how far
I'm willing to go?

34:08.322 --> 34:10.741
- Alec, no!
- Daisy, stay back.

34:10.908 --> 34:12.534
You shut up!

34:16.121 --> 34:18.165
- No!
- Phoebe, stop him.

34:33.054 --> 34:35.056
I can't do it.

34:35.431 --> 34:36.933
Yes, you can.

34:37.100 --> 34:40.312
You have every one of my powers,
including the power to find Daisy.

34:40.478 --> 34:43.481
Leo, wouldn't it be faster for you guys
just to switch your powers back?

34:43.773 --> 34:45.942
No, I'm still too weak.

34:46.109 --> 34:47.444
It's up to Piper.

34:48.777 --> 34:50.530
Now trust me, Piper.

34:51.031 --> 34:53.324
Okay, look deep inside yourself...

34:54.492 --> 34:56.369
...at peace...

34:57.287 --> 34:59.247
...a place where you find love.

35:00.832 --> 35:04.377
- Wait, I can hear her.
- All right, listen to her.

35:04.544 --> 35:05.879
Let her tell you where she is.

35:07.046 --> 35:12.802
She's screaming. She's afraid.
He's pushing her past some trees.

35:13.386 --> 35:16.681
Can you recognize the place?
Can you tell where they're at?

35:17.682 --> 35:20.476
- Heroes Grove. Golden Gate Park.
- Let's go.

35:22.061 --> 35:25.648
- What about Leo?
- I'm fine. Save Daisy.

35:25.815 --> 35:29.193
Piper, we really sort of need
the power of three to do this.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.738
Actually, I don't think we do.

35:32.113 --> 35:36.701
I think there's a better way. Piper, you
stay with Leo. Prue, you drive. I'll talk.

35:39.662 --> 35:40.955
Why are you taking me here?

35:41.122 --> 35:43.750
You could have been
my mate, Daisy. My equal.

35:43.916 --> 35:44.959
I don't understand.

35:45.126 --> 35:46.961
Now you've made this place
your deathbed.

35:47.128 --> 35:49.046
It's your own fault
that you won't live.

35:49.213 --> 35:51.507
No, Alec, please don't kill me.

35:51.674 --> 35:54.594
- If you ever loved me...
- If I ever loved you what?

35:54.760 --> 35:58.514
You think I could just get over you?
Move on? Find somebody else?

36:00.975 --> 36:03.561
You're the only woman
I've ever loved, Daisy.

36:03.728 --> 36:07.023
And now I'm the last man
that you'll ever leave.

36:08.691 --> 36:10.401
Let her go!

36:10.568 --> 36:13.320
- She's mine!
- You son of a...

36:15.531 --> 36:16.824
Do it, Prue. Now!

36:16.991 --> 36:19.243
<i>What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine</i>

36:19.410 --> 36:20.786
<i>Let our powers cross the line</i>

36:20.953 --> 36:23.581
You really should have
stayed out of this.

36:25.124 --> 36:28.627
<i>I offer up this gift to share
Switch our powers through the air.</i>

36:31.297 --> 36:32.464
What?

36:34.341 --> 36:36.427
Where's my power?

36:38.846 --> 36:42.141
- It's hate. Hate is his trigger.
- Then hate him.

36:42.891 --> 36:44.810
No problem.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.896
Bring him to me, Phoebe.

37:02.119 --> 37:04.037
<i>What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine</i>

37:04.204 --> 37:05.998
<i>Let our powers cross the line</i>

37:13.547 --> 37:15.382
He's gone.

37:15.549 --> 37:17.384
You did it.

37:19.052 --> 37:20.887
Are you okay?

37:22.347 --> 37:25.434
I can't believe
how much hate that took.

37:25.892 --> 37:28.145
I never want to feel like that again.

37:28.729 --> 37:31.690
You just gave me my life back.

37:34.401 --> 37:39.364
Now when we get home, you're gonna
give me my power back, right?

37:43.702 --> 37:46.162
I almost wish I didn't give you
your powers back,

37:46.329 --> 37:48.623
then you wouldn't be able to leave.

37:49.165 --> 37:50.834
Me too.

37:53.211 --> 37:55.755
So if Daisy's a whitelighter to be,

37:55.922 --> 37:58.633
doesn't that mean
that you used to be...?

37:58.800 --> 38:00.677
Human?

38:01.219 --> 38:03.179
Yes, it does.

38:03.346 --> 38:06.891
I was actually born right here
in San Francisco.

38:07.058 --> 38:10.228
I lived here all the way up
until I went off to the war.

38:10.687 --> 38:13.022
You mean, like Vietnam?

38:13.189 --> 38:15.191
No, World War II.

38:15.358 --> 38:18.695
I left med school
and enlisted as a medic.

38:18.862 --> 38:22.282
I wanted to help save people,
not shoot them.

38:22.448 --> 38:24.742
The last thing I remember,

38:24.909 --> 38:28.079
I was bandaging
a soldier's head wound,

38:28.580 --> 38:30.790
then I felt a sharp pain,

38:30.957 --> 38:34.544
and then the next thing I know I was
floating, surrounded by whitelighters.

38:35.295 --> 38:38.339
And they offered me
immortality...

38:39.007 --> 38:43.803
...and a chance to help
special people like you.

38:44.679 --> 38:51.352
I never once ever doubted
that I didn't make the right choice...

38:52.061 --> 38:53.396
...until I met you.

38:55.022 --> 38:59.527
Ever since, all I can think is how I'd
give it up to have a mortal life again,

38:59.694 --> 39:03.489
to have a family and grow old...

39:04.240 --> 39:05.866
...with you.

39:08.703 --> 39:10.204
Is that possible?

39:10.371 --> 39:13.332
Yeah, I can become human
again, Piper.

39:13.499 --> 39:16.002
I mean, if you want me to.

39:16.544 --> 39:19.588
Are you kidding?
I want that more than anything.

39:19.755 --> 39:22.925
- I don't want to lose you again.
- But?

39:23.801 --> 39:27.847
But then you wouldn't be able
to help other witches,

39:28.013 --> 39:31.058
or other future whitelighters,
would you?

39:31.475 --> 39:34.270
You couldn't help save
the next Daisy.

39:43.779 --> 39:45.030
I'd better go.

39:56.458 --> 39:58.460
I love you.

40:12.015 --> 40:14.226
I love you too.

40:25.362 --> 40:28.824
- How you doing?
- Been better. How about you?

40:28.991 --> 40:30.867
Those IA sons of bitches
wanted me to wear a mike.

40:31.034 --> 40:33.203
Yeah. So you wearing one?

40:33.578 --> 40:35.747
What do you think?

40:36.832 --> 40:38.208
You in any kind of trouble?

40:38.875 --> 40:40.502
Less than you.

40:42.087 --> 40:45.340
I just want you to know
I'm doing it for a good cause.

40:45.507 --> 40:47.717
Andy, I'm your partner.

40:48.426 --> 40:50.428
More importantly, I'm your friend.

40:52.180 --> 40:54.933
I want to believe
that you're on our side.

40:55.850 --> 40:58.561
But it would really help me
if I knew why you were doing this.

41:00.188 --> 41:04.567
I'm not asking for IA,
I'm asking for me.

41:05.986 --> 41:07.404
I think you owe me that.

41:13.535 --> 41:16.037
I told you they'd meet, didn't I?

41:16.204 --> 41:19.707
Doesn't do us any good
if we can't hear them over the noise.

41:22.293 --> 41:24.087
Sure wish I could read lips.

41:25.964 --> 41:27.382
Who are you covering for?

41:33.680 --> 41:34.973
It's Prue.

41:36.557 --> 41:39.018
And all I can tell you is

41:39.310 --> 41:42.563
she's connected to all
of our unsolved cases.

41:43.898 --> 41:45.817
Prue, huh?

41:46.859 --> 41:50.238
I was so hoping
you weren't gonna say that.

41:55.493 --> 41:59.497
- I can't get a thing.
- He's covering up for Prue Halliwell.

41:59.664 --> 42:01.124
What?

42:01.290 --> 42:03.584
How the hell did you...?

42:03.751 --> 42:05.670
Oh, my God!

42:20.559 --> 42:22.061
Leo.

42:35.533 --> 42:39.119
Is it just me, or can you draw
a chalk outline around this place?

42:39.286 --> 42:41.497
Wow, I don't know what you could
possibly mean, Phoebe.

42:41.664 --> 42:46.001
I mean, the weekend's almost over,
we never made it to Cabo,

42:46.168 --> 42:49.296
I'm never gonna see Andy again,
and Piper just lost the love of her life.

42:49.463 --> 42:52.341
The glass is way more
than half full here, Prue.

42:52.508 --> 42:57.596
Piper saved the love of her life,
Alec is long gone,

42:57.763 --> 43:01.475
and Daisy is on her way back
to her family.

43:01.642 --> 43:05.354
We even managed to straighten out
our powers. Thank God.

43:05.521 --> 43:09.108
Thank God? I thought that you always
wanted an active power.

43:09.817 --> 43:14.655
Maybe, but I never thought
I'd actually miss my premonitions.

43:14.822 --> 43:18.784
Having your power was like wearing
a dress that was too tight.

43:18.951 --> 43:20.494
Not that that would ever happen.

43:20.661 --> 43:23.080
Remember when I said
that you had no vision?

43:23.247 --> 43:26.333
- Which time?
- Well, you will never hear it again.

43:26.917 --> 43:29.836
It takes a lot of strength
to see what you see.

43:30.629 --> 43:32.589
I'll drink to that.

43:32.756 --> 43:36.301
If we can't go to Cabo, we might
as well bring Cabo to us, right?

43:36.510 --> 43:39.846
I don't know, Pheebs,
we still have some serious problems.

43:40.013 --> 43:43.809
Oh, problems
are for Monday mornings.

43:43.975 --> 43:45.894
What do you say?

43:46.144 --> 43:49.564
It's gonna be a hell of a Monday
morning, but until then...
