03:37.083 --> 03:39.451
BULLETS THIS SEASON, BUT WITH NO

03:39.519 --> 03:41.820
TIME TO SPARE, ANY TROUBLE TODAY

03:41.888 --> 03:43.522
MEANS THE POLAR BEAR WILL HAVE

03:43.556 --> 03:45.791
TO SETTLE FOR SECOND PLACE.

03:45.825 --> 03:48.327
>> THIS ROAD IS EMPTY RIGHT NOW.

04:16.155 --> 04:17.823
WE DON'T GET THAT LUCKY TO HAVE

04:17.890 --> 04:18.590

05:00.600 --> 05:02.234
ACCIDENT, RAY HAS PLAYED IT

SAFE, AND HIS HARD WORK HAS PAID

05:04.570 --> 05:05.537
OFF.

05:05.605 --> 05:06.605
>> SO I GOT MORE LOADS THAN

05:06.639 --> 05:07.406
ANYBODY ELSE.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.940
I'M PRETTY PROUD OF MYSELF,

05:08.975 --> 05:12.711
ESPECIALLY FOR BEING A ROOKIE.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.427
SEASON, GREG TALKED A BIG GAME.

>> JACK JESSEE, THE HAUL ROAD

05:30.730 --> 05:32.597
ACE, IS OUT AHEAD.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.700
WE NEED TO HAVE HIM BEHIND US

05:34.734 --> 05:36.535
AND KEEP HIM BEHIND US FOR THE

05:36.569 --> 05:39.338
DURATION OF THE ICE ROAD SEASON.

05:39.405 --> 05:40.605
>> narrator: BUT BAD LUCK AND

05:40.673 --> 05:42.708
BAD DECISIONS QUICKLY KNOCKED

05:42.775 --> 05:45.210
GREG OUT OF THE RACE.

05:45.244 --> 05:46.244
>> NOW I'M BACK AT THE SHOP WITH

05:46.312 --> 05:47.212
TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT

05:47.246 --> 05:48.313
TRUCK TO TAKE IT OUT AGAIN.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.614
IT'S...

05:49.649 --> 05:50.515
DON'T EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT

05:50.550 --> 05:51.583
IT.

05:51.617 --> 05:55.987
BUT I'M STILL PRETTY IRRITATED.

05:56.055 --> 05:56.955
I COULD HAVE STILL BEEN ON TOP

05:57.023 --> 05:58.223
OF THE LOAD COUNT IF I WANTED TO

05:58.257 --> 05:59.257
FLY AND BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF

05:59.292 --> 06:01.159
MYSELF AND MY TRUCK, BUT NOT

06:01.227 --> 06:02.294
INTERESTED IN DOING THAT.

06:02.328 --> 06:03.528
I REALLY DON'T CARE WHAT THE

06:03.596 --> 06:04.596
LOAD COUNT IS.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.331
IT'S GOT ALMOST NO BEARING ON

06:06.399 --> 06:08.433
ME.

06:08.468 --> 06:09.668
>> narrator: WITH NO CHANCE TO

06:09.702 --> 06:11.603
GET BACK INTO THE COMPETITION,

GREG'S ONLY GOT ONE GOAL FOR HIS

06:13.940 --> 06:15.841
FINAL RUN OF THE SEASON.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.313
TWO FORMER FRIENDS RAN TOGETHER,

06:21.347 --> 06:23.248
RAY CHOSE TO PULL OVER INSTEAD

06:23.282 --> 06:25.484
OF GIVING GREG THE SATISFACTION

06:25.518 --> 06:27.319
OF SACKING OR PASSING HIM ON THE

06:27.387 --> 06:28.520
ROAD.

06:28.554 --> 06:29.521
>> I'M GONNA PULL RIGHT THE

06:29.589 --> 06:31.790
[bleep] OVER AND LET HIM GO BY.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.692

JUST GET IT GOING.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.306
WHAT IS HE THINKING?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.948

06:56.983 --> 06:57.949
DRIVEWAY INSTEAD OF INTO A

WHERE, IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE

07:06.058 --> 07:09.428
HEAT, GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.397
TO LOSE, GREG IS OUT FOR

REVENGE.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.102

07:19.806 --> 07:21.773
GONNA TRACK HIM DOWN AND GET

07:21.841 --> 07:25.343
HIM ON A HILL.

07:25.344 --> 07:27.212
>> narrator: 20 MILES BEHIND RAY

07:27.246 --> 07:28.580
AND GREG...

07:28.648 --> 07:30.215
>> WE'RE CLIMBING ICE CUT.

07:30.249 --> 07:31.850
IT'S PRETTY SLICK.

07:31.884 --> 07:32.784
>> narrator: JACK JESSEE HAS

07:32.852 --> 07:34.486
SPENT HIS SEASON HAULING THE

07:34.520 --> 07:36.421
HEAVIEST AND MOST DANGEROUS

07:36.489 --> 07:39.191
LOADS ON THE ROAD, AND HIS FINAL

07:39.225 --> 07:41.493
RUN IS NO EXCEPTION.

07:41.561 --> 07:42.661
>> YOU KNOW, THIS JET FUEL IS

07:42.695 --> 07:45.063
EXTREMELY VOLATILE.

07:45.064 --> 07:47.666
IT HAS A LOW FLASH POINT.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.301
IF THIS STUFF GETS TOO HOT, IT

07:49.335 --> 07:50.368
CAN JUST GO UP FOR THE HECK OF

07:50.403 --> 07:51.503
IT.

07:51.537 --> 07:52.737
IF THIS LOAD WERE TO GO INTO

07:52.772 --> 07:53.538
A DITCH AND GET A HOLE PUNCHED

07:53.573 --> 07:56.141
IN IT, YOU'RE [bleep].

07:59.679 --> 08:00.579
>> narrator: AT THE BEGINNING OF

08:00.646 --> 08:02.414
THE SEASON, JACK JESSEE WAS

08:02.448 --> 08:04.416
THE ODDS-ON FAVORITE TO WIN

08:04.450 --> 08:06.051
THE DASH FOR THE CASH.

08:06.085 --> 08:07.219
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT JACK JESSEE.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.287
HE'S THE ACE OF THE HAUL ROAD.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.589
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.224
>> narrator: LONG, HEAVY HAULS

08:12.291 --> 08:13.658
KNOCKED JACK OUT OF THE

08:13.693 --> 08:14.926
LOAD-COUNT RACE.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.094
>> WHEN YOU'RE PULLING THE

08:16.128 --> 08:17.295
OVERSIZED STUFF, HAZARDOUS

08:17.330 --> 08:19.130
LOADS, YOU CAN'T GET IN A HURRY.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.232
>> narrator: BUT THE DEFENDING

08:20.266 --> 08:21.867
CHAMP ISN'T GOING HOME

08:21.934 --> 08:23.034
EMPTY-HANDED.

08:23.102 --> 08:24.135
>> YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T GET AS

08:24.203 --> 08:25.136
MANY LOADS IN AS SOME OTHERS OUT

08:25.171 --> 08:26.204
THERE.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.873
BUT THE ONES I DID DO PAID ME

08:27.940 --> 08:28.940
BETTER.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.408
UH, YOU KNOW, YOU GET

08:30.476 --> 08:32.577
COMPENSATED FOR HAZARDOUS LOADS.

08:32.645 --> 08:33.745
YOU GET COMPENSATED FOR

08:33.779 --> 08:34.746
OVERSIZED LOADS.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.582
SO, ALL IN ALL, YOU KNOW, IT'S

08:37.617 --> 08:39.484
BEEN A REALLY GOOD SEASON.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.685
LAST YEAR, I DIDN'T DO ANY

08:40.720 --> 08:43.021
PUSHING, AND THIS YEAR I DID.

08:43.055 --> 08:44.022
ONE OF THEM TOOK FIVE WHOLE

08:44.056 --> 08:44.956
DAYS.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.191
IF I HADN'T HAVE DONE THAT,

08:46.225 --> 08:47.759
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GOT A

08:47.793 --> 08:50.228
COUPLE EXTRA LOADS IN THERE.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.863
>> narrator: BUT THE YEAR'S NOT

08:51.931 --> 08:53.999
OVER UNTIL THE LAST LOAD REACHES

08:54.033 --> 08:56.034
THE FAIRBANKS YARD.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.570
AND UP AHEAD, A D.O.T. PLOW IN

08:58.604 --> 09:00.906
THE DITCH IS A GRIM REMINDER OF

09:00.940 --> 09:02.574
JUST HOW DANGEROUS THE MELTING

09:02.608 --> 09:05.410
ICE ROAD HAS BECOME.

09:05.478 --> 09:06.578
>> THE JOB THEY DO AND AS CLOSE

09:06.612 --> 09:08.213
TO THE EDGE AS THEY GET, IT JUST

09:08.247 --> 09:09.481
HAPPENS.

09:09.515 --> 09:10.582
IT HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY.

09:10.650 --> 09:11.583
THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH YOU CAN

09:11.651 --> 09:12.317
DO.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.554
IT'S JUST HOLD ON FOR THE RIDE.

09:18.524 --> 09:19.858
WE'RE COMING TO THE END OF

09:19.892 --> 09:21.226
THE ICE ROAD SEASON HERE.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.629
YOU GOTTA BE EXTRA CAREFUL.

09:24.664 --> 09:25.664
THAT WAS A PRETTY SLICK CURVE

09:25.698 --> 09:26.898
RIGHT THERE.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.466
THAT'LL CATCH YOU BY SURPRISE.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.535
THAT ONE AREA'S NO JOKE, THOUGH.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.306
IT'S A PRETTY SERIOUS AREA.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.373
>> narrator: JACK'S FINAL RUN OF

09:35.408 --> 09:37.375
THE SEASON WILL BE ONE OF HIS

09:37.410 --> 09:39.644
MOST DANGEROUS, AND THE HAUL

09:39.679 --> 09:41.546
ROAD ACE ISN'T TAKING ANY

09:41.581 --> 09:42.747
CHANCES.

09:42.815 --> 09:44.382
>> I GOTTA PUT CHAINS ON TO GO

09:44.450 --> 09:45.917
UP ATIGUN.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.285
THIS ROAD HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.387
YOU GOTTA HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE

09:49.422 --> 09:50.855
AND EXPERIENCE TO HANDLE IT.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.390
IT MAY NOT GET YOU THE FIRST

09:52.458 --> 09:53.858
TIME OR THE SECOND TIME YOU

09:53.926 --> 09:54.993
DON'T PAY ATTENTION.

09:55.027 --> 09:57.028
BUT IF YOU--IF YOU DON'T GIVE IT

09:57.096 --> 10:00.098
RESPECT, THAT ROAD WILL GET YOU.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.466
>> narrator: 20 MILES UP THE

10:01.500 --> 10:02.567
ROAD...

10:02.602 --> 10:03.568
>> WE HAD A HARD TIME JUST

10:03.603 --> 10:04.202
GETTING HERE.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.303
I'VE BEEN SPINNING FOR THE LAST

10:05.371 --> 10:07.105
FREAKIN' TWO MILES HERE,

10:07.139 --> 10:08.206
TRYING TO GET UP THESE LITTLE

10:08.274 --> 10:08.940
HILLS, SO...

10:08.975 --> 10:10.208
>> narrator: ROOKIE RAY IS

10:10.276 --> 10:12.544
APPROACHING ATIGUN PASS.

10:12.578 --> 10:14.446
>> I THINK WHAT I'VE LEARNED,

10:14.480 --> 10:16.281
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, DOING THIS

10:16.349 --> 10:17.649
THIS WINTER, IS YOU DON'T WANT

10:17.717 --> 10:19.751
ANY PROBLEMS, NO MISERY--JUST TO

10:19.819 --> 10:22.120
BE SAFE, SO I'M GONNA CHAIN UP

10:22.154 --> 10:24.189
RIGHT HERE.

10:24.256 --> 10:25.190
YEAH, THEY SAID THERE'S GOOD

10:25.224 --> 10:26.024
DIRT ON THE ROAD, BUT I AIN'T

10:26.058 --> 10:27.926
TAKING ANY CHANCES.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.027
LIKE, BEFORE, I THINK I WOULD

10:29.061 --> 10:30.295
HAVE TRIED TO TAKE THIS LOAD UP

10:30.329 --> 10:32.163
ATIGUN WITHOUT CHAINS ON.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.632
YOU JUST CHAIN UP.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.033
YOU LOSE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME,

10:35.101 --> 10:37.836
BUT IT'S SAFE.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.537
>> narrator: JUST BEHIND, GREG

10:39.572 --> 10:42.273
DECIDES NOT TO CHAIN UP.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.109
>> DEFINITELY WANT TO PASS HIM.

10:44.176 --> 10:45.343
SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM

10:45.378 --> 10:46.277
HOLDING A LITTLE BETTER SPEED

10:46.312 --> 10:47.379
THAN HE IS.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.913
HOPEFULLY WE CAN KEEP THIS PUSH

10:48.948 --> 10:50.548
GOING BY JUST MOTORING RIGHT

10:50.616 --> 10:51.650
OVER IT AND NOT HAVING TO CHAIN

10:51.684 --> 10:52.384
UP.

10:52.418 --> 10:53.251
THERE'S NOT REALLY GONNA BE A

10:53.285 --> 10:54.753
POSSIBILITY TO STOP.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.187
I'M JUST GONNA KEEP GOING.

10:56.255 --> 11:00.458
JUST NOT GETTING ANY CHOICE.

11:00.526 --> 11:01.726
ALL RIGHT, WE FINALLY SEE HIM.

11:01.761 --> 11:04.029
TIME TO GO GET HIM.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.563
>> narrator: COMING UP, A

11:05.598 --> 11:07.465
SHOWDOWN ON THE PASS...

11:07.500 --> 11:09.200
>> I AIN'T GONNA LET YOU HAVE IT

11:09.235 --> 11:10.368
THAT EASY.

11:10.403 --> 11:11.436
>> JUST LET ME AROUND.

11:11.470 --> 11:12.637
>> [bleep] THAT.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.271
>> [bleep].

11:13.339 --> 11:17.942
YOU STARTED A WAR NOW.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.344
>> narrator: ON ATIGUN PASS,

11:19.412 --> 11:21.680
GREG TRACKED DOWN HIS RIVAL,

11:21.714 --> 11:22.914
RAY.

11:22.948 --> 11:24.582
>> CATCHING UP ON RAY PRETTY

11:24.617 --> 11:25.483
QUICK HERE.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.851
I GUESS RAY DECIDED TO GO AHEAD

11:26.886 --> 11:27.485
AND CHAIN.

11:27.553 --> 11:28.486
MIGHT BE A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT

11:28.554 --> 11:30.488
HIS LITTLE MOTOR THERE, SO...

11:44.970 --> 11:46.371
>> I'M JUST GONNA SIT RIGHT HERE

11:46.405 --> 11:48.940
AND WAIT FOR IT.

11:49.008 --> 11:51.943
>> NOW HE'S STOPPED.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.111
>> narrator: GREG WILL WAIT

11:53.145 --> 11:55.480
UNTIL RAY GETS BACK ON THE ROAD,

11:55.514 --> 11:57.115
SETTING UP A CHANCE TO SACK, OR

11:57.183 --> 11:58.883
PASS, HIM WHILE CLIMBING THE

11:58.951 --> 12:01.119
HILL.

12:01.153 --> 12:03.321
>> NOW HE'S STOPPED.

12:17.703 --> 12:20.138
>> TIME TO GO GET HIM.

12:20.206 --> 12:21.139
[suspenseful music]

12:21.207 --> 12:28.847
¶ ¶

12:28.881 --> 12:32.383
>> [bleep] [bleep], RAY.

12:32.451 --> 12:33.651
HE'S LITERALLY DRIVING THROUGH

12:33.686 --> 12:35.553
THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD...

12:35.588 --> 12:37.122
REALLY BAD CALL WITH AN

12:37.156 --> 12:38.757
OVERSIZED LOAD, IN GENERAL, MUCH

12:38.824 --> 12:39.824
LESS IN FRONT OF ME.

12:39.859 --> 12:42.127
COMING AROUND.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.397
>> I AIN'T GONNA LET YOU HAVE IT

12:46.432 --> 12:47.832
THAT EASY.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.667
>> JUST LET ME AROUND.

12:49.735 --> 12:52.303
>> [bleep] THAT.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.738
>> [bleep].

12:53.773 --> 12:56.841
YOU STARTED A WAR NOW.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.042
>> I WOULD HAVE NEVER MADE IT.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.377
EVEN WITH MY CHAINS ON, I'M

12:59.445 --> 13:00.311
SPINNING.

13:00.346 --> 13:01.446
GREG'S HITTING IT WITHOUT

13:01.480 --> 13:02.580
CHAINS.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.082
>> narrator: RAY'S BEST BET IS

13:04.116 --> 13:05.216
TO STAY IN THE CENTER OF THE

13:05.284 --> 13:07.452
ROAD, WHERE FRESH SNOW PROVIDES

13:07.486 --> 13:08.920
THE MOST TRACTION.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.655
>> I AIN'T GONNA SLIDE BACKWARDS

13:10.689 --> 13:12.123
'CAUSE--BECAUSE OF GAMES.

13:12.158 --> 13:13.024
I'M NOT DOING IT.

13:13.092 --> 13:14.559
>> WELL, RIGHT NOW I'M NOT

13:14.627 --> 13:16.194
CHAINED UP.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.662
RAY HAS CHAINS ON.

13:17.730 --> 13:21.032
AND NOW HE'S TAKING HIS

13:21.100 --> 13:21.933
SWEET-ASS TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF

13:21.967 --> 13:22.934
THE ROAD.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.302
HE'S PUTTING ME IN DANGER DOING

13:24.336 --> 13:25.537
IT.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.472
I HAVE TO KEEP SPEED BUILT.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.307
HE'S GOT ROOM TO GET OVER.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.809
HE'S GONNA GET ME SPUN OUT

13:30.843 --> 13:33.578
BECAUSE HE'S NOT MOVING OVER.

13:33.612 --> 13:34.846
RAY, YOU'RE ABOUT TO SPIN ME

13:34.880 --> 13:35.547
OUT.

13:35.581 --> 13:36.915
>> I'VE SPUN OUT ON THAT PASS

13:36.949 --> 13:38.850
BEFORE BEING BEHIND PEOPLE.

13:38.918 --> 13:41.186
YOU KNOW, HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY.

13:41.220 --> 13:41.853
>> I GOT MORE SPEED.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.255
YOU NEED TO JUST LET ME AROUND.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.191
>> [bleep] THAT.

13:46.225 --> 13:47.025
>> I'M GONNA GET PISSED.

13:47.092 --> 13:47.992
>> THINK I'M [bleep] MOVING

13:48.027 --> 13:48.660
OVER?

13:48.694 --> 13:49.761
I'M ALREADY SPINNING WITH MY

13:49.829 --> 13:50.461
CHAINS ON.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.531
>> THIS IS [bleep] NOW.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.732
>> CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT.

13:54.767 --> 13:55.834
GO BITCH WHAT YOU WANT.

13:55.901 --> 13:56.734
IT'S LIKE, "DUDE, YOU SHOULD

13:56.802 --> 13:57.435
HAVE CHAINED UP."

13:57.469 --> 13:58.837
BOTTOM LINE.

13:58.904 --> 14:00.471
>> [bleep], RAY.

14:00.539 --> 14:01.739
>> IT'S ALL GAMES, MAN.

14:01.807 --> 14:03.474
IT'S ALL FREAKIN' GAMES.

14:03.542 --> 14:04.909
>> I'M GOING 10 MILES AN HOUR.

14:04.944 --> 14:05.643
NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO END UP

14:05.678 --> 14:07.278
HAVING TO DROP A GEAR BECAUSE

14:07.313 --> 14:08.546
HE'S [bleep] BLOCKING THE ROAD.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.648
THIS IS [bleep] BULL.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.816
RAY, YOU'RE ABOUT TO SPIN ME

14:11.851 --> 14:12.717
OUT.

14:12.751 --> 14:13.718
COMING OVER THE SLIPPERIEST

14:13.752 --> 14:14.819
PART RIGHT HERE, THIS PIPE

14:14.887 --> 14:17.755
CROSS.

14:17.823 --> 14:21.392
I'M GETTING INTO POSITION NOW.

14:37.476 --> 14:38.109
YOUR CHAINS ON.

14:38.143 --> 14:39.344
DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.747
IT'LL COME UP AND BITE YOU.

14:42.781 --> 14:47.819
>> WELL, MY REAR END IS HOPPIN'.

14:47.853 --> 14:52.457
[bleep] BURNT OUT.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.993
[bleep] BURNT OUT.

14:55.027 --> 14:56.427
>> SORRY.

14:56.462 --> 14:58.730
SHOULD HAVE CHAINED UP.

15:26.125 --> 15:30.828
THAT'S TOO BAD.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.830
>> HE KNEW I DIDN'T CHAIN.

15:32.898 --> 15:34.465
NOW, THANKS TO RAY'S [bleep]

15:34.500 --> 15:37.802
STUPIDITY, I'M STUCK ON THE SIDE

15:37.836 --> 15:39.904
OF THE [bleep] HILL, CHAINING

15:39.939 --> 15:40.605
UP.

15:40.639 --> 15:41.639
>> IT PAYS TO CHAIN UP.

15:41.707 --> 15:42.907
THAT'S FOR SURE.

TITLE, BUT HER SEASON'S BEEN A

16:25.050 --> 16:26.918
SUCCESS.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.957
WAS GONNA BE LIKE, EVEN THOUGH

16:32.992 --> 16:35.326
I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY HARD,

16:35.361 --> 16:37.528
I THINK I'D DO IT AGAIN.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.065
THE YEAR, A MASSIVE CAR HAULER

16:41.100 --> 16:43.434
WAS MORE THAN LISA COULD HANDLE.

>> UM...
WAS MORE THAN LISA COULD HANDLE.

16:50.142 --> 16:54.078

17:18.270 --> 17:22.440
[radio beeps]

17:22.474 --> 17:23.775
I HAD TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

17:23.809 --> 17:26.177
I WAS HAULING THE HEAVIER STUFF,

17:26.211 --> 17:27.678
BECAUSE EVERY TIME I GET A LIGHT

17:27.713 --> 17:30.148
LOAD, I GOT TEASED BY THE GUYS.

17:30.182 --> 17:31.349

17:43.796 --> 17:45.396

17:54.907 --> 17:57.308
REUNITING WITH AN OLD FRIEND.

17:57.342 --> 17:58.509

18:02.281 --> 18:03.448
WE'RE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

18:03.515 --> 18:04.615
I BOUGHT HER WHEN SHE WAS SIX

18:04.683 --> 18:05.616
MONTHS OLD, AND I GOT TO NAME

18:05.651 --> 18:06.884
HER, GIVE HER A REGISTERED NAME

18:06.919 --> 18:07.785
AND EVERYTHING, AND I WAS

18:07.820 --> 18:09.053
ACTUALLY THE FIRST ONE EVER ON

18:09.088 --> 18:09.887
HER BACK EVER.

18:09.955 --> 18:11.355
THROUGH A SERIES OF

18:11.423 --> 18:12.757
CIRCUMSTANCES, SHE WAS SOLD BACK

18:12.791 --> 18:14.158
TO THE LADY I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT

18:14.193 --> 18:15.793

19:03.842 --> 19:05.710
SIDE.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.136
DANGEROUS OF THE SEASON.

WITH A TANKER HEADING BACK

19:35.841 --> 19:38.509
SOUTH, THIS HILL IS JUST BAD,

19:38.544 --> 19:39.210
'CAUSE THESE THINGS ARE

19:39.244 --> 19:40.344
NOTORIOUSLY TAIL-HEAVY.

19:45.317 --> 19:47.218
IS SO SLICK, ANY EXTRA POWER

19:47.252 --> 19:49.387
WILL SEND THE TRUCK SPINNING OUT

19:49.421 --> 19:51.589
OF CONTROL AND COULD PUSH JACK

19:51.623 --> 19:53.858
AND 8,000 GALLONS OF JET FUEL

19:53.926 --> 19:57.061
OVER THE EDGE.

19:58.096 --> 19:59.597

HIT THE GAS AND TAKE HIS

20:26.992 --> 20:29.160
CHANCES.

20:29.161 --> 20:29.860

INTO THE FRESH SNOW...

20:38.503 --> 20:41.472
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD.

JACK JESSEE'S RIG IS SPINNING

20:48.113 --> 20:49.880
OUT OF CONTROL.

21:13.038 --> 21:13.804
>> WE'RE SPINNING.

21:13.839 --> 21:14.739
WE'RE SPINNING.

21:14.773 --> 21:15.640
I GOT THE TRUCK HERE TO TRADE

21:15.707 --> 21:18.276
SIDES WITH ME.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.278
[horn blares]

21:20.312 --> 21:24.081
[chuckles]

21:24.116 --> 21:26.450
I MADE IT!

21:26.485 --> 21:27.451
CHECK ENGINE LIGHT'S ON, BUT

21:27.486 --> 21:30.988
I MADE IT.

21:31.056 --> 21:32.623
WOW, THAT WAS--THAT WAS RATHER

21:32.658 --> 21:33.724
EXCITING.

>> narrator: ON HIS WAY DOWN THE

21:34.960 --> 21:36.727
PASS, RAY FINDS JACK ON THE

21:36.795 --> 21:37.595
RADIO.

21:37.596 --> 21:39.163
>> WELL, GREG TRIED PUTTING A

21:39.197 --> 21:40.898
BIG PASS ON ME IN ATIGUN PASS.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.668
I CHAINED UP. HE DIDN'T.

21:43.669 --> 21:44.802
SO HE CAME UP RIGHT ON MY ASS,

21:44.836 --> 21:46.003
AND HE'S LIKE, "I GOT TO GET

21:46.038 --> 21:46.704
AROUND YOU!

21:46.772 --> 21:47.371
I GOT TO GET AROUND YOU!

21:47.439 --> 21:48.139
I'M COMING! I'M COMING!"

21:48.173 --> 21:49.540
AND HE TRIED GETTING AROUND ME.

21:49.574 --> 21:50.608
THERE WASN'T MUCH ROOM.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.609
HE GOT BACK THERE, AND THEN HE

21:51.643 --> 21:52.810
SPUN OUT.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.713
>> [laughs]

21:55.781 --> 21:56.614
SO WHAT, DID YOU SPIN HIM OUT

21:56.648 --> 21:57.248
RIGHT BEHIND YOU?

21:57.316 --> 21:58.416
>> OH, YEAH.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.686
>> [laughs]

22:01.720 --> 22:02.787
THAT'S FUNNY.

22:02.821 --> 22:03.821
I THINK RAY'S JUST PRETTY

22:03.889 --> 22:05.222
HUNGRY FOR SOME LOADS.

22:05.257 --> 22:05.990
YOU KNOW, HE CAME UP HERE FOR

22:06.024 --> 22:08.359
ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY,

22:08.427 --> 22:10.094
AND THAT WAS TO WORK.

22:10.128 --> 22:11.629
I THINK HE'S GOT THAT JOB TAKEN

22:11.697 --> 22:13.064
CARE OF, AND I KNOW HE'S GOT A

22:13.131 --> 22:14.131
LOT MORE TO LEARN ABOUT THE

22:14.166 --> 22:15.766
ROAD, BUT HE'S LEARNING.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.435
>> YEAH, IT'S A BUNCH OF GAMES

22:17.502 --> 22:18.636
WITH THEM GUYS.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.537
IT'S A LOT OF GAMES, YOU KNOW,

22:19.571 --> 22:21.906
AND IT GETS A LITTLE--A LITTLE

22:21.940 --> 22:23.174
RECKLESS SOMETIMES IT SEEMS

22:23.241 --> 22:23.874
LIKE.

22:23.909 --> 22:24.909
>> WELL, HE SHOULD HAVE CHAINED

22:24.976 --> 22:26.077
UP FOR IT.

22:26.144 --> 22:28.412
>> I'M SURE HE'S [bleep] PISSED.

22:28.447 --> 22:32.083
>> I AM ABSOLUTELY IRATE.

22:32.150 --> 22:35.319
THAT [bleep] RAY JUST PULLED...

22:35.354 --> 22:36.854
IS RIDICULOUS.

22:36.888 --> 22:37.788
HE JUST DID EVERYTHING IN HIS

22:37.823 --> 22:39.323
POWER RIGHT THERE TO SCREW ME

22:39.358 --> 22:40.224
OVER.

22:40.258 --> 22:41.058
YOU KNOW, MOST THINGS DON'T GET

22:41.126 --> 22:42.126
TO ME, BUT WHEN IT'S SOMEONE

22:42.160 --> 22:43.527
ELSE'S STUPIDITY THAT PUTS MY

22:43.595 --> 22:44.962
LIFE IN JEOPARDY, PUTS MY

22:44.996 --> 22:47.431
LIVELIHOOD IN JEOPARDY, I GOT NO

22:47.466 --> 22:50.801
TIME FOR THAT BULL CRAP.

22:50.836 --> 22:51.969
IT WON'T SURPRISE ME IF THAT

22:52.037 --> 22:53.537
STUPID LITTLE STUNT COST RAY

22:53.605 --> 22:54.705
HIS JOB, ESPECIALLY AFTER

22:54.773 --> 22:57.808
STUFFING HIS TRUCK IN A DITCH.

OF THE SEASON.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.222
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS LOAD, AND

23:11.256 --> 23:13.691
I'LL LEAVE IT IN COLDFOOT.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.059
THIS IS GONNA TOP OFF MY

23:15.093 --> 23:16.060
PAYCHECK.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.328
IT'S GOT SOME METAL ON IT.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.896
IT'S GOT PIPE JUST TO MAKE ME

23:18.930 --> 23:20.164
FEEL AT HOME, SINCE I HAULED SO

23:20.232 --> 23:21.766
MUCH PIPE THIS YEAR.

23:21.800 --> 23:22.800
IT'S GOT A PICKUP ON THERE.

23:22.834 --> 23:23.901
IT'S GOT SOME LUMBER ON THERE.

23:23.935 --> 23:25.169
THERE'S SOME PARTS FOR DOORS

23:25.203 --> 23:26.337
AND BUILDING MATERIAL, AND

23:26.371 --> 23:28.672
THAT'S SORT OF A ODDBALL.

23:28.707 --> 23:29.507
IT'S KIND OF LIKE SOMEBODY'S

23:29.541 --> 23:34.412
BREAKFAST, THIS LOAD.

23:34.446 --> 23:36.046
I'M SORT OF OUT OF THE RACE FOR

23:36.081 --> 23:38.616
THE LOAD COUNT.

>> narrator: HE'LL END THE YEAR

23:39.918 --> 23:42.787
WELL BEHIND HIS RIVAL, HUGH.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.054
>> SO, YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS LIKE

23:44.089 --> 23:46.056

30:35.383 --> 30:36.116
BRIEFLY.

30:36.151 --> 30:39.253

30:39.287 --> 30:40.888
WAS THAT AN OVERSIZED LOAD

30:40.955 --> 30:42.022
SHOULDN'T BE TRYING TO PASS

SOMETHING THAT IS MOST

30:57.172 --> 30:59.873
END UP COSTING ME MY JOB.

SIT DOWN AND HAVE A MEETING.

TO LEARN THAT ROAD AND TO BE

34:21.225 --> 34:22.392
CONSIDERED A VETERAN.

AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

AND IN THIS CASE, IT WAS, UH--

35:00.565 --> 35:01.932
IT WASN'T GOOD FOR HIM IN

35:01.966 --> 35:03.200
