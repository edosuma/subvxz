00:58.038 --> 01:02.475
The key is listening to the signals
and hearing what they're saying.

01:02.542 --> 01:05.306
If she touches you soft,

01:05.379 --> 01:07.779
that's how she wants to be touched.

01:07.848 --> 01:11.181
You do that until you can hear her get wet.

01:11.251 --> 01:13.947
You gotta know women. I'm serious.

01:14.020 --> 01:16.113
Last time I went home,
my girl was so grateful,

01:16.189 --> 01:18.384
she went right outside
and started washing my car.

01:18.458 --> 01:20.289
Detailed it.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.726
Everything. Just to thank me.

01:24.698 --> 01:26.256
Now, we gotta stop talking about pussy

01:26.333 --> 01:28.824
'cause if we're not careful,
this is gonna get us killed.

01:28.902 --> 01:29.960
Especially in this neighborhood,

01:30.036 --> 01:32.061
and I'm not gonna let pussy get us killed.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.598
Wanna go left?

01:35.675 --> 01:37.267
All right, get around this right here.

01:37.344 --> 01:38.436
Move left.

01:39.546 --> 01:40.979
Watch it.

01:41.047 --> 01:42.708
Come on, man.
You gotta speed up.

01:43.984 --> 01:46.145
Sarnt, you ever had
two girls at the same...

01:47.821 --> 01:49.550
Go! Go! Go!

01:49.623 --> 01:51.090
Go! Go!

01:51.158 --> 01:52.284
Fire! Fire! West!

01:52.359 --> 01:54.020
I.E.D. I.E.D. I.E.D.

01:54.094 --> 01:56.585
Five points south of Najaf.

01:56.663 --> 01:57.595
Third vehicle.

01:57.664 --> 01:58.596
We got it.

01:58.665 --> 02:00.394
That was fucked up!

02:01.735 --> 02:02.827
Came right through the door!

02:02.903 --> 02:04.029
Shit, that was close.

02:04.104 --> 02:05.662
You all right, sir?

02:05.739 --> 02:06.671
What?

02:06.740 --> 02:08.639
You all right?

02:08.708 --> 02:10.335
Yeah.

02:10.410 --> 02:11.434
Sarnt, look.

02:11.511 --> 02:12.443
What?

02:12.512 --> 02:14.070
Look at your pants, Sir.

02:41.174 --> 02:43.438
Did you tell your girlfriend
what happened yet?

02:44.945 --> 02:46.378
No, sir.

02:47.547 --> 02:48.844
You're gonna have to tell her.

02:48.915 --> 02:51.884
I'll tell her when it's working again, sir.

02:51.952 --> 02:54.512
Okay.

02:54.588 --> 02:58.388
But you don't become
functional overnight.

02:58.458 --> 03:00.892
You're gonna have to be
patient with yourself.

03:00.961 --> 03:03.122
She's gonna have to be
patient with you.

03:04.631 --> 03:06.462
Can you do that?

03:06.533 --> 03:07.898
I guess.

03:09.369 --> 03:11.234
All right, then.

03:11.304 --> 03:14.137
Good luck to you, Sergeant.

03:14.207 --> 03:16.107
Thank you, sir.

03:22.415 --> 03:23.541
I've gotta be on there.

03:23.617 --> 03:24.982
I don't want to miss this plane.

03:25.051 --> 03:25.881
Told you already.

03:25.952 --> 03:27.715
- You gotta see the MCNCO.
- Thank you.

03:27.787 --> 03:29.914
- Airport?
- Yeah.

03:29.990 --> 03:31.924
Sergeant T.K. Poole.

03:33.493 --> 03:37.429
Listen, buddy, all I want to do
is get back to my wife and kid.

03:37.497 --> 03:40.159
- You gotta help me out here.
- I just go by the list.

03:40.233 --> 03:41.860
Can I see the list?

03:50.210 --> 03:51.973
Hey. Here it is.

03:52.045 --> 03:53.034
Hey.

03:54.381 --> 03:55.678
Sergeant Fred Cheaver.

03:55.749 --> 03:57.512
648. Reserves.

03:57.584 --> 03:59.643
Hello. It's right here.

03:59.719 --> 04:01.152
That's how you spell it?

04:01.221 --> 04:02.813
With a C-H?

04:02.889 --> 04:04.857
How else would you spell Cheaver?

04:04.925 --> 04:06.324
Probably lots of ways.

04:06.393 --> 04:08.452
Not in English.

04:08.528 --> 04:12.988
<i>Welcome aboard
Flight 6240 to New York.</i>

04:13.066 --> 04:15.591
<i>Our estimated flying time
this evening to JFK</i>

04:15.669 --> 04:18.069
<i>will be 8 hours and 20 minutes.</i>

04:33.153 --> 04:34.518
Hey.

04:34.588 --> 04:36.249
We're all on the same team.

04:37.624 --> 04:38.556
You got leave?

04:38.625 --> 04:39.683
Yeah. 30 days.

04:39.759 --> 04:41.021
Oh, yeah?

04:41.094 --> 04:42.186
Me, too.

04:42.262 --> 04:44.127
How long you got?

04:44.197 --> 04:46.688
The rest of my life,
thank you very much.

04:46.766 --> 04:48.358
My tour's over.

04:48.435 --> 04:49.902
I'm going home.

05:16.796 --> 05:18.787
If we go down in the water...

05:18.865 --> 05:20.560
you're gonna be sitting pretty.

05:22.435 --> 05:23.424
What?

05:24.471 --> 05:28.134
I said if we crash in the ocean,
your donut's gonna come in handy.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.403
It'll be like an extra life preserver.

05:30.477 --> 05:33.207
If we crash in the ocean,
it's not gonna matter.

05:34.214 --> 05:37.547
Don't talk about planes crashing
when you're on a plane.

05:37.617 --> 05:38.914
Why not?

05:39.919 --> 05:41.784
It's basic common sense.

05:41.855 --> 05:44.949
It's the same reason
that when you're on a cruise ship,

05:45.025 --> 05:46.219
<i>they're not showing Titanic.</i>

05:46.292 --> 05:47.281
It scares people.

05:49.462 --> 05:54.456
Who wants to think about
drunk pilots and midair collisions?

05:54.534 --> 05:57.162
Nothing you can do about it, anyway.

06:09.015 --> 06:10.812
It's good to be home.

06:14.688 --> 06:16.383
We're gonna miss the whole thing.

06:18.692 --> 06:19.750
What the hell?

06:23.196 --> 06:25.664
<i>Please do not leave
your baggage unattended.</i>

06:25.732 --> 06:28.963
<i>All unattended baggage
will be confiscated.</i>

06:29.035 --> 06:30.525
Oh, God. I gotta get to Vegas.

06:30.603 --> 06:32.628
I can't be sitting around here.

06:32.706 --> 06:34.469
You're going to Vegas?

06:34.541 --> 06:36.270
Yeah. I'm going to Vegas.

06:36.342 --> 06:39.311
- Hey, are you going to Vegas?
- St. Louis.

06:39.379 --> 06:40.641
Excuse me.

06:40.714 --> 06:43.205
Do you know what happened here,
why all the flights are cancelled?

06:43.283 --> 06:44.477
There was a blackout here.

06:44.551 --> 06:46.280
The city was dark for five hours.

06:46.352 --> 06:48.582
The lights just came back on
a little while ago.

06:50.557 --> 06:52.684
The lights are back on in the Northeast,

06:52.759 --> 06:54.317
but the planes are still not moving.

06:54.394 --> 06:57.522
Airline officials say it could be
at least two days

06:57.597 --> 06:59.656
until they get their planes
to the right airports

06:59.733 --> 07:00.859
and resume their schedules.

07:00.934 --> 07:02.959
- Two days.
- Yeah.

07:03.036 --> 07:05.004
They don't know shit.

07:05.071 --> 07:07.130
Supposedly, planes are flying
out of Pittsburgh,

07:07.207 --> 07:09.175
but they can't even get us there
till tomorrow night.

07:09.242 --> 07:11.142
And even that's a big maybe.

07:12.912 --> 07:14.539
Well, it's nice meeting you all.

07:14.614 --> 07:15.842
I'm outta here.

07:15.915 --> 07:17.007
Good luck.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.015
Where are you goin'?

07:18.084 --> 07:20.678
I want to rent a car
before there's none left.

07:20.754 --> 07:22.654
It's 14 hours to St. Louis.

07:22.722 --> 07:26.021
Drive all night, be there
having dinner with my wife tomorrow.

07:26.092 --> 07:29.061
Sure as shit not gonna stay here
while they run out of food and water.

07:39.773 --> 07:41.707
Hey, man.

07:41.775 --> 07:44.039
I bet you planes
are flying out of St. Louis.

07:44.110 --> 07:45.873
Probably.

07:45.945 --> 07:48.539
Maybe I can catch a flight
to Vegas from there.

07:48.615 --> 07:50.048
Me, too.

07:52.952 --> 07:55.944
Okay. But we split
everything three ways...

07:56.022 --> 07:58.616
gas, rental, insurance, everything.

07:58.691 --> 08:00.318
No free rides.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.534
That's it. Sorry. No cars left.

08:14.474 --> 08:15.736
You got nothing?

08:15.809 --> 08:18.039
Nothing.

08:18.111 --> 08:19.169
Can you believe this?

08:19.245 --> 08:21.236
Maybe we can call the Army.

08:22.415 --> 08:24.280
The Army?
What's the Army gonna do?

08:24.350 --> 08:26.511
You guys in the Army?

08:26.586 --> 08:27.780
Yeah.

08:28.988 --> 08:29.920
Were you over there?

08:29.989 --> 08:31.820
Just got back.

08:33.393 --> 08:35.155
Come here.

08:35.227 --> 08:36.558
All right, listen.

08:36.629 --> 08:38.062
I do have one car left.

08:38.131 --> 08:40.462
I'm supposed to hold it
for my boss, but screw it.

08:40.533 --> 08:41.557
You guys can have it.

08:41.634 --> 08:45.035
Oh, my God. That's so nice!

08:45.104 --> 08:46.036
Thank you!

08:46.105 --> 08:47.265
Oh, no.

08:47.340 --> 08:48.807
Thank you.

09:05.191 --> 09:06.681
Sure is beautiful.

09:08.895 --> 09:10.453
I guess we don't have time to stop.

09:10.530 --> 09:12.725
No. We don't have time to stop.

09:15.869 --> 09:18.064
I never been to New York before.

09:18.137 --> 09:19.297
You been to New York, Sarnt?

09:19.372 --> 09:21.237
I'm stationed at Fort Drum.

09:21.307 --> 09:22.899
I've been there a million times.

09:22.976 --> 09:24.910
I thought you were from Las Vegas.

09:24.978 --> 09:26.502
No.

09:32.218 --> 09:34.209
I'm not from Las Vegas, either.

09:35.555 --> 09:37.045
Well, my friend's from there.

09:37.123 --> 09:39.421
That's his guitar.

09:39.492 --> 09:40.424
Well, it was his guitar.

09:40.493 --> 09:44.862
I mean, he got killed,
so I'm just taking it back to his family.

09:45.899 --> 09:47.764
That's a real nice thing to be doing.

10:08.421 --> 10:11.254
You must be a good dancer, huh?

10:11.324 --> 10:13.622
Oh, no. My wife's a good dancer.

10:13.693 --> 10:16.355
I just try to keep up.

10:16.429 --> 10:19.091
She loves all those Latin dances.

10:19.165 --> 10:22.532
Samba, merengue, tango.

10:22.602 --> 10:24.536
She's a looker, huh?

10:24.604 --> 10:27.402
Yes, she is. Yeah.

10:27.473 --> 10:29.941
What she's doing with someone like me,

10:30.009 --> 10:32.409
I'll never know, and I'm not gonna ask.

10:33.513 --> 10:35.879
We're lucky ones, aren't we?

10:35.949 --> 10:38.543
We made it through in one piece.

10:38.618 --> 10:42.714
I got shot in the leg, but all I gotta do
is put some goo on it, so...

10:42.789 --> 10:45.451
Did you get shot... Sarnt?

10:45.525 --> 10:48.460
No. I caught a piece of shrapnel.

10:50.129 --> 10:51.061
Where?

10:51.130 --> 10:52.893
Outside of Najaf.

10:52.966 --> 10:55.196
No. I mean where on your body.

10:56.202 --> 10:57.897
Thigh.

10:57.971 --> 11:00.166
Upper thigh.

11:00.239 --> 11:01.263
How about you, Sarnt?

11:02.642 --> 11:05.770
I had back surgery.
Three crushed vertebrae.

11:05.845 --> 11:06.971
What happened?

11:09.048 --> 11:11.243
Porto John fell on me.

11:11.317 --> 11:12.443
What?

11:12.518 --> 11:13.746
Was it full?

11:13.820 --> 11:15.583
No. It was...

11:15.655 --> 11:17.020
It was brand-spanking-new.

11:17.090 --> 11:18.580
It was completely sanitary.

11:18.658 --> 11:21.183
We were setting up a camp
outside of Bandar,

11:21.260 --> 11:23.160
and it fell off a forklift.

11:23.229 --> 11:24.821
Well, don't tell the ladies that.

11:24.897 --> 11:27.263
You gotta find something
better than that.

11:27.333 --> 11:28.823
You kidding?

11:28.901 --> 11:30.994
I love that Porto John.

11:31.070 --> 11:33.038
Best thing that ever happened to me.

11:33.106 --> 11:35.233
A week later, my unit
shipped off to Mosul,

11:35.308 --> 11:36.775
got shot to pieces.

11:36.843 --> 11:38.606
The shitter saved my life.

11:39.612 --> 11:42.672
Wish I could've brought it home,
set up a shrine.

11:45.184 --> 11:48.278
If I have another kid,
I'm gonna name him Porto John.

11:48.354 --> 11:49.946
That's...

11:50.023 --> 11:51.786
Porto John Cheaver.

12:02.702 --> 12:03.726
They all look so good.

12:03.803 --> 12:05.600
I don't know what to order.

12:05.671 --> 12:07.036
What can I get for you?

12:08.541 --> 12:11.271
Give me the Number 8, the Number 9,
and the Number 10.

12:11.344 --> 12:13.312
Coffee, orange juice, and milk.

12:17.550 --> 12:18.778
Good, huh?

12:23.222 --> 12:24.621
I tell you, this woman's smart.

12:24.690 --> 12:26.658
She's got plans for us.

12:26.726 --> 12:29.490
You... Can't...
She's dying to get married

12:29.562 --> 12:30.859
'cause I'm her ticket to the top.

12:30.930 --> 12:32.921
How are you her ticket to the top?

12:32.999 --> 12:35.024
She's a lieutenant.
She outranks you.

12:35.101 --> 12:36.568
No. Right now she does.

12:36.636 --> 12:37.728
I mean, she's got the connections,

12:37.804 --> 12:39.328
but I got the juice.

12:39.405 --> 12:41.896
I mean, it's like a merger between us.

12:41.974 --> 12:44.670
You know? She's gonna get me
into Officer Candidate School.

12:44.744 --> 12:46.439
I'm gonna move up the ranks.

12:46.512 --> 12:48.377
Then I'm gonna run for office.

12:48.448 --> 12:50.643
And you have to have
a good head of hair to run for office,

12:50.716 --> 12:52.149
and I have a good head of hair.

12:53.419 --> 12:56.388
So your fiancée is meeting you in Vegas?

12:56.456 --> 12:58.720
No. She's stationed at Fort Dix.

12:58.791 --> 13:00.019
I'm gonna meet her there afterwards.

13:00.093 --> 13:02.357
Oh, I get it.

13:02.428 --> 13:04.328
First, a little fun at the tittie bars.

13:04.397 --> 13:06.865
No. I got business to take care of.

13:06.933 --> 13:09.458
You paying back a gambling debt?

13:09.535 --> 13:10.524
Wrong again.

13:11.537 --> 13:14.199
Randy had a gambling debt.

13:14.273 --> 13:15.535
Yep.

13:15.608 --> 13:17.940
That's why he had to rob Lucky Jim's.

13:18.010 --> 13:21.605
He stole $50,000 so he could
pay back the loan sharks.

13:21.681 --> 13:24.479
But then of course,
the cops got on his tail, and...

13:24.550 --> 13:26.040
and that's when he enlisted.

13:26.119 --> 13:27.586
You know, he just went...

13:27.653 --> 13:29.211
went right into the Army
and disappeared.

13:29.288 --> 13:30.653
It was the perfect getaway.

13:30.723 --> 13:33.954
See, that's exactly
what the Army doesn't want.

13:34.961 --> 13:36.861
The Army's got standards.

13:36.929 --> 13:38.419
Like, it... it means something.

13:38.498 --> 13:40.432
It's not like lowlifes and gangbangers.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.558
What?

13:41.634 --> 13:43.898
The last thing we need is trash
like your pal Randy.

13:43.970 --> 13:45.699
- They don't want...
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

13:45.771 --> 13:47.170
- Whoa!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

13:47.240 --> 13:49.265
That "trash" saved my fucking life!

13:49.342 --> 13:51.572
He pulled me outta that truck
when I got shot!

13:51.644 --> 13:55.045
And he took a fucking bullet
in the fucking head!

13:55.114 --> 13:58.015
All I got left is his fucking guitar!

14:02.155 --> 14:03.782
Get back in the car.

14:03.856 --> 14:04.823
Get back in the car!

14:04.891 --> 14:07.758
I ought to kick your ass!

14:07.827 --> 14:09.089
Oh, you're gonna kick my ass.

14:09.162 --> 14:11.392
Yeah. I could do it, too.

14:11.464 --> 14:13.591
I'd just push you
down a flight of stairs,

14:13.666 --> 14:15.065
punch you in the kidney.

14:15.134 --> 14:16.931
You'd better have eyes
in the back of your head.

14:17.003 --> 14:19.369
This is not... We don't have time
for ass-kicking stops.

14:19.438 --> 14:21.406
You just say you're sorry,
and let's get going.

14:21.474 --> 14:23.465
- I'm not sorry!
- I'm not talking to you.

14:23.543 --> 14:25.807
- Say you're sorry.
- No. I'm not gonna say I'm sorry.

14:25.878 --> 14:28.972
That's like saying I'm sorry
that the sky's blue.

14:29.048 --> 14:30.515
Come on, man. You just...

14:30.583 --> 14:32.551
You just insulted her dead friend. Huh?

14:32.618 --> 14:34.313
Come on. Suck it up.

14:34.387 --> 14:35.615
Say you're sorry. Let's go.

14:35.688 --> 14:37.849
I'm sorry that you got so upset.

14:38.858 --> 14:39.790
Okay?

14:39.859 --> 14:41.554
No. That's not an apology.

14:41.627 --> 14:42.889
But it's pretty close.

14:42.962 --> 14:44.054
Come on, let's go.

14:44.130 --> 14:46.257
That's not an apology.

14:47.533 --> 14:48.465
Come on. Let me in.

14:51.370 --> 14:52.302
Dude, let me in.

14:52.371 --> 14:54.134
I can't.

14:54.207 --> 14:56.141
Just press the key thing, man.

14:56.209 --> 14:57.540
The keys are in the car.

15:01.214 --> 15:02.704
Shit.

15:08.287 --> 15:09.652
What the fuck were you thinking?

15:09.722 --> 15:14.853
I was thinking I had two fucking nut cases
throwing shit, getting into a fight.

15:14.927 --> 15:16.918
- We didn't fight.
- This is not my fault.

15:16.996 --> 15:19.055
Well, it's sure as shit not our fault.

15:19.131 --> 15:20.564
We didn't lock the keys in the car.

15:20.633 --> 15:22.328
Whatever. We need a coat hanger.

15:22.401 --> 15:24.494
Coat hanger's not gonna work
on a late model car.

15:24.570 --> 15:27.232
You need a Slim Jim.

15:27.306 --> 15:30.434
Well, you know what?
I don't have a Slim Jim.

15:44.257 --> 15:45.246
Thank you.

15:48.761 --> 15:52.197
So, they went on this worldwide tour,

15:52.265 --> 15:55.564
and they... they got...
'cause they got this contract.

15:55.635 --> 15:57.034
And they got to meet the queen,

15:57.103 --> 15:58.661
and they got to meet the president.

15:58.738 --> 16:00.501
And after that,

16:00.573 --> 16:04.236
Randy got the guitar from his daddy,

16:04.310 --> 16:06.073
who got it from his granddaddy,

16:06.145 --> 16:08.306
who got it from Elvis.

16:08.381 --> 16:09.541
Elvis.

16:09.615 --> 16:10.582
Come on.

16:10.650 --> 16:12.208
It's true.

16:12.285 --> 16:14.583
That guitar's worth a lot of money.

16:38.144 --> 16:39.975
She's a beaut, don't you think?

16:40.980 --> 16:42.971
Yeah. I already got one, though.

16:43.049 --> 16:43.981
- You do?
- Yeah.

16:44.050 --> 16:45.642
Me, too.

16:45.718 --> 16:47.652
That's great. What color?

16:49.822 --> 16:52.086
So, how is it over there?

16:52.158 --> 16:53.921
You guys see any action?

16:53.993 --> 16:55.085
- Yep.
- Yeah.

16:55.161 --> 16:56.651
Yeah?

16:56.729 --> 16:58.720
Well, we all think
you're doing a hell of a job.

16:58.798 --> 16:59.856
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

16:59.932 --> 17:01.559
No, no. Thank you.

17:01.634 --> 17:03.829
You know, we get clients all the time

17:03.903 --> 17:07.304
in the dealership who want
their Hummers outfitted just like yours.

17:07.373 --> 17:10.171
The desert camouflage, the whole bit.

17:10.242 --> 17:12.642
One guy even put armor on his H1.

17:13.713 --> 17:15.738
They want bullet holes?

17:15.815 --> 17:18.715
Yeah, they probably do.

17:18.784 --> 17:20.308
Hey, check this out.

17:20.386 --> 17:22.945
Push that third button right back there.

17:24.022 --> 17:24.954
Not bad, huh?

17:25.023 --> 17:26.048
Yeah.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.218
Yeah. Bet you guys
don't have that on your vehicles.

17:29.462 --> 17:30.929
No, sir, we don't.

17:40.039 --> 17:41.802
You got it?

17:41.874 --> 17:44.570
- That didn't take long.
- Thank you.

18:00.893 --> 18:02.861
I have to use the bathroom.

18:05.064 --> 18:06.691
I'll pull over by those bushes.

18:06.766 --> 18:08.825
No, I said "use the bathroom,"

18:08.901 --> 18:11.165
not squat by the side of the road.

18:29.755 --> 18:34.021
And the weird and wacky talent
this week is...

18:44.703 --> 18:46.068
Congratulations, Wayne.

18:58.784 --> 19:00.046
All yours.

19:01.620 --> 19:03.554
Do you want to play pool, or...

19:03.622 --> 19:05.055
pinball or something?

19:05.124 --> 19:06.216
Nah. We should get going.

19:06.292 --> 19:07.725
Okay.

19:20.306 --> 19:21.568
Turn it down!

19:21.640 --> 19:23.574
Turn it off!

19:29.148 --> 19:30.809
Is this a good show?

19:31.817 --> 19:32.806
Yeah.

19:34.153 --> 19:36.417
I've never seen it before.
Is it new?

19:36.489 --> 19:37.888
Not that new.

19:40.292 --> 19:41.850
I've haven't really seen
much of anything lately

19:41.927 --> 19:46.261
'cause I've been overseas
the past 14 months, and...

19:46.332 --> 19:47.822
you know, I'm in the Army.

19:49.168 --> 19:50.635
But I'm home on leave for 30 days,

19:50.703 --> 19:54.104
so I'm just... I'm hoping to catch up.

19:55.674 --> 19:57.107
I like your jacket.

19:58.611 --> 19:59.543
It's okay.

19:59.612 --> 20:01.011
What's the "I" stand for?

20:03.482 --> 20:04.779
Indiana.

20:04.850 --> 20:08.342
You know, the college and the state

20:08.420 --> 20:10.081
where you're standing right now.

20:12.191 --> 20:16.059
Yeah, you know, I was thinking
of going to college when I get out, but...

20:16.128 --> 20:17.117
Do you like it?

20:17.196 --> 20:19.528
Do you think you could be quiet?

20:23.135 --> 20:25.126
Sure, I can be quiet.

20:25.204 --> 20:26.228
Good.

20:32.878 --> 20:34.311
No way.

20:52.398 --> 20:54.923
You know, I'm limping
because when I was over there,

20:55.000 --> 20:56.365
I got shot in the leg.

20:56.435 --> 20:59.029
That wasn't very smart, was it?

20:59.104 --> 21:00.799
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

21:07.980 --> 21:10.505
Back off! Back off!

21:10.583 --> 21:11.550
What's wrong with you guys?

21:11.617 --> 21:12.879
Back off!

21:13.886 --> 21:15.319
Calm down.

21:15.387 --> 21:16.854
No, that's right. Be afraid.

21:16.922 --> 21:18.480
No, be very afraid.

21:18.557 --> 21:19.546
Go, go, go!

21:19.625 --> 21:20.557
All right!

21:28.534 --> 21:31.264
Yeah! We won!

21:31.337 --> 21:34.934
Kicked their college asses!

21:35.007 --> 21:38.272
Oh, this girl's crazy.

21:39.511 --> 21:40.671
Yeah.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.371
Just glad I didn't have my weapon.

22:02.201 --> 22:05.762
TV! TV! TV!

22:11.377 --> 22:13.538
- I wish we had some booze.
- Yeah.

22:13.612 --> 22:15.910
Check my bag.

22:15.981 --> 22:18.779
Doctor in Germany gave me
a bottle of schnapps.

22:23.856 --> 22:27.257
And a tough night here at the arena
for the home team.

22:27.326 --> 22:28.918
- Thank you.
- All right.

22:38.103 --> 22:39.070
Not bad.

22:40.372 --> 22:43.170
I mean, what you really want
after a fight is whiskey

22:43.242 --> 22:45.107
'cause it mellows you out.

22:45.177 --> 22:48.408
If you want to get mean, you drink gin,

22:48.480 --> 22:51.449
vodka if you want to zone out,

22:51.517 --> 22:53.542
and you save tequila
for when you want to get crazy.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.210
She didn't need tequila tonight.

23:00.192 --> 23:02.023
Did anybody see a straw around here?

23:03.529 --> 23:04.621
No. Why?

23:04.697 --> 23:06.187
'Cause if you drink through a straw,

23:06.265 --> 23:08.096
it gets you drunker.

23:08.167 --> 23:09.156
That's not true.

23:09.234 --> 23:10.428
Of course it is.

23:10.502 --> 23:11.434
That's ridiculous.

23:13.038 --> 23:14.403
How could that be true?

23:14.473 --> 23:17.465
Well, I don't really know how it works.

23:17.543 --> 23:19.636
It just... It...

23:19.712 --> 23:21.942
It just gets in...
It just goes in faster.

23:22.014 --> 23:24.141
Oh, it's just one of...

23:24.216 --> 23:25.683
one of the mysteries of life?

23:25.751 --> 23:27.719
- Is that what you're saying?
- Uh-huh.

24:04.223 --> 24:05.952
Shit, man.

24:07.426 --> 24:08.654
You okay?

24:09.928 --> 24:12.055
I was...

24:13.599 --> 24:15.430
You know.

24:18.270 --> 24:19.532
Sorry.

24:27.946 --> 24:29.243
Honey, it's me.

24:29.314 --> 24:30.645
You there?

24:30.716 --> 24:32.650
Pick up.

24:34.620 --> 24:36.247
Okay. Well, we got held up a little bit,

24:36.321 --> 24:39.290
but we'll be rolling in
in about two hours or so.

24:46.365 --> 24:48.333
Is that the Mississippi?

24:48.400 --> 24:49.765
That's it.

24:51.737 --> 24:54.706
I always wanted to go
on one of those riverboats.

24:54.773 --> 24:57.367
You know?
Do you think maybe we could stop?

24:57.442 --> 24:58.773
No.

25:26.138 --> 25:27.435
Pat!

25:30.843 --> 25:32.071
Pat!

25:40.552 --> 25:43.282
Honey! I'm home!

25:47.359 --> 25:48.849
Honey?

25:52.231 --> 25:54.062
Sure you got the right house?

25:54.132 --> 25:56.430
Yeah.

25:56.501 --> 25:58.867
Can't believe your own dog
doesn't know you.

25:58.937 --> 26:01.462
We don't have a dog.

26:13.218 --> 26:14.810
Yes, sir.

26:14.887 --> 26:18.379
You have a good life here, Cheaver.

26:32.170 --> 26:33.296
There you are.

26:37.209 --> 26:38.369
Fred.

26:40.245 --> 26:41.371
You're home.

26:48.587 --> 26:50.054
I missed you.

26:51.590 --> 26:55.151
God, I missed you.

26:57.863 --> 26:59.194
Let me get the dog to stop.

27:01.433 --> 27:02.695
Whose dog is that?

27:03.702 --> 27:05.192
Mine.

27:07.339 --> 27:08.499
No, no, no.

27:08.573 --> 27:10.973
Pogo, you come with me.
Yes. You come with me.

27:11.043 --> 27:12.670
Yes. Yes. Yes.

27:12.744 --> 27:14.803
I'm gonna put you in here for a while.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.075
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

27:17.149 --> 27:18.548
Mommy loves you.

27:22.955 --> 27:23.944
So.

27:26.892 --> 27:28.382
Where you been all my life?

27:29.761 --> 27:31.558
How's your back?

27:31.630 --> 27:34.064
It's fine.

27:34.132 --> 27:35.997
Doesn't matter now.

27:36.068 --> 27:37.592
Scott spent the night at Brad's house.

27:37.669 --> 27:39.899
He should be back soon.

27:39.972 --> 27:41.166
Great.

27:42.341 --> 27:44.070
Where are your friends?

27:45.310 --> 27:46.937
They're out back.

27:48.313 --> 27:49.712
Don't you think we should get them?

27:49.781 --> 27:51.009
Well, sure. Yeah.

27:51.083 --> 27:52.641
- Let 'em in.
- Okay.

27:57.389 --> 27:58.651
Welcome.

28:02.761 --> 28:04.729
Can I get you something to drink?

28:04.796 --> 28:06.127
Yeah.

28:07.532 --> 28:08.999
Do you want one, Fred?

28:09.067 --> 28:10.898
No. Thanks.

28:13.672 --> 28:15.936
Well, I bet you're all glad to be back.

28:16.008 --> 28:17.703
- Yeah.
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

28:19.478 --> 28:21.173
Excuse me for a minute.

28:30.022 --> 28:31.580
Sit down.

28:43.869 --> 28:45.268
So.

28:45.337 --> 28:47.134
How are you?

28:47.205 --> 28:49.400
Fine.

28:49.474 --> 28:52.136
Are you sure?

28:52.210 --> 28:53.142
Is anything wrong?

28:53.211 --> 28:55.202
No. Nothing.

28:56.882 --> 28:58.747
Something's wrong.

28:58.817 --> 29:00.444
I don't see you

29:00.519 --> 29:04.250
for almost two years, and then...

29:06.324 --> 29:07.256
I don't know.

29:07.325 --> 29:09.384
Well...

29:09.461 --> 29:11.053
I don't know, either.

29:13.231 --> 29:17.964
Well, I guess they say that...

29:18.036 --> 29:21.096
you know, that...

29:21.173 --> 29:23.607
it's difficult at first, and...

29:23.675 --> 29:25.973
I'm sorry. I jus... I really am.

29:26.044 --> 29:27.306
I just can't do this.

29:27.379 --> 29:30.473
Everyone told me to wait,
but I don't see the point.

29:31.783 --> 29:33.683
You know me.
I'm no good at pretending.

29:34.686 --> 29:35.812
Pretending about what?

29:37.089 --> 29:38.647
Fred, you're not gonna like this.

29:39.658 --> 29:40.682
Okay.

29:41.993 --> 29:43.290
Okay.

29:46.898 --> 29:48.525
I think I w...

29:50.368 --> 29:52.165
I need a divorce.

29:53.238 --> 29:54.170
What?

29:54.239 --> 29:55.866
I'm sorry.

29:55.941 --> 29:58.910
But to go around pretending
for a week that it's not true,

29:58.977 --> 30:00.569
well, that didn't seem fair to you, either.

30:00.645 --> 30:03.136
Wait a minute...

30:03.215 --> 30:05.877
I come home, and...

30:09.621 --> 30:11.748
Why do...
Why do you want a divorce?

30:11.823 --> 30:14.223
I didn't plan it this way.

30:14.292 --> 30:16.419
It just happened. You were gone.

30:16.495 --> 30:19.464
I'm sorry, but I've moved on.

30:20.799 --> 30:22.027
You gotta be kidding.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.398
I got a new job, and I'm finally happy.

30:25.403 --> 30:26.768
Finally happy? What...

30:26.838 --> 30:28.738
You mean you weren't...
you weren't happy before?

30:28.807 --> 30:30.672
Well, I guess I was. I don't know.

30:30.742 --> 30:32.300
L... I...

30:36.114 --> 30:37.581
You seeing someone else?

30:37.649 --> 30:40.413
- No.
- You can tell me.

30:40.485 --> 30:42.476
I'm not seeing anyone else.

30:42.554 --> 30:44.215
I don't want to see anyone else.

30:44.289 --> 30:46.416
I'm happy being alone.

30:46.491 --> 30:48.857
I want to be alone.

30:48.927 --> 30:52.226
I know that sounds harsh,
but it's the truth.

30:52.297 --> 30:54.265
I am happy.

30:56.501 --> 30:58.401
Without you.

30:59.504 --> 31:01.938
Oh, my God.

31:02.007 --> 31:04.271
This is what makes a guy flip out.

31:05.744 --> 31:06.938
He's gonna strangle her.

31:07.012 --> 31:09.446
If it were you,
you wouldn't strangle her.

31:09.514 --> 31:11.345
Okay.

31:11.416 --> 31:14.044
Shoot her. Whatever.

31:21.593 --> 31:22.617
Hey.

31:22.694 --> 31:24.252
- What's up?
- Hi.

31:24.329 --> 31:26.297
Who are you?

31:26.364 --> 31:28.298
Friends of your dad.

31:28.366 --> 31:30.266
My dad?

31:30.335 --> 31:31.859
- He's...
- Scott.

31:33.838 --> 31:36.068
Dad!

31:36.141 --> 31:39.076
It's good to see you.

31:42.514 --> 31:45.005
Wow! Look at you.

31:48.887 --> 31:50.582
How are you?

31:50.655 --> 31:52.816
I'm good.

31:54.359 --> 31:55.758
How are you?

31:57.462 --> 31:59.259
Just great.

31:59.331 --> 32:00.628
So.

32:00.699 --> 32:02.360
Did Mom tell you?

32:03.435 --> 32:05.266
Yeah.

32:05.337 --> 32:06.463
You surprised?

32:08.573 --> 32:09.767
Yeah.

32:11.543 --> 32:13.704
Can you believe it?

32:13.778 --> 32:15.803
Stanford.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.745
- What?
- I got into Stanford.

32:17.816 --> 32:18.908
What?

32:18.984 --> 32:20.076
Yeah, I got in!

32:20.151 --> 32:21.448
You got into...

32:21.519 --> 32:22.508
I got into Stanford.

32:22.587 --> 32:23.952
Oh, yeah!

32:24.022 --> 32:26.320
Oh, my... Yes! All right!

32:26.391 --> 32:27.790
- I did it.
- I knew you could do it!

32:27.859 --> 32:30.123
Yeah, and I got a scholarship
that'll pay for half the tuition.

32:30.195 --> 32:32.493
- Fantastic.
- And I made six grand working this year.

32:32.564 --> 32:35.727
- Excellent.
- And I need $20,000 to pay for the rest.

32:36.901 --> 32:38.630
That's not so great.

32:38.703 --> 32:41.729
Well, I told him I'm not sure
we can come up with the $20,000.

32:43.808 --> 32:46.003
It's doable.

32:46.077 --> 32:48.910
I'll just get my old job back,
and if we have to,

32:48.980 --> 32:50.845
we'll take a second mortgage
on the house.

32:50.915 --> 32:52.678
We have a second mortgage already.

32:52.751 --> 32:56.881
Well, then we'll sell
the fucking house, all right?

32:56.955 --> 33:00.516
Okay. Well, it took the Schneiders
two years to sell theirs.

33:00.592 --> 33:03.686
I need the money in three weeks
or I lose my place.

33:03.762 --> 33:05.855
I'll get you the money.

33:05.930 --> 33:07.090
I promise.

33:10.568 --> 33:12.331
Can I talk to you?

33:15.106 --> 33:17.802
What are we doing here?
We should be focused on Scott.

33:17.876 --> 33:18.900
I am focused on Scott.

33:18.977 --> 33:22.105
We gotta make sure we can do this for him,
pool our resources, whatever it takes.

33:22.180 --> 33:25.741
Why do you need a divorce right now?
I just don't get it.

33:25.817 --> 33:27.182
I'm sorry, Fred.

33:27.252 --> 33:29.083
But this is what I want to do.

33:29.154 --> 33:30.644
Now, I've had some papers drawn up,

33:30.722 --> 33:34.488
and I just want to stick to the plan.

33:47.305 --> 33:49.535
Listen. We're gonna keep it together.

33:49.607 --> 33:51.404
We're gonna stay calm.

33:51.476 --> 33:55.173
Look, there's no killing yourself
or anyone else, okay?

33:55.246 --> 33:56.508
Hey, you're gonna get through this.

33:56.581 --> 33:57.605
All right? Do you hear me?

34:09.060 --> 34:10.618
This is fine right here.

34:10.695 --> 34:12.253
Here you go.

34:12.330 --> 34:13.422
Cheaver.

34:14.933 --> 34:16.525
Cheaver.

34:16.601 --> 34:18.864
Come on, what's your plan?

34:18.937 --> 34:21.268
I'll take you guys to the airport

34:21.339 --> 34:23.431
and then I'm gonna drive
straight to Salt Lake,

34:23.507 --> 34:24.496
see my brother.

34:26.511 --> 34:28.069
I'm not going back home.

34:28.146 --> 34:29.476
I can tell you that much.

34:29.547 --> 34:31.411
What about your kid?

34:31.483 --> 34:34.782
I'll figure something out.

34:34.853 --> 34:36.547
Your brother should lend you the money.

34:36.621 --> 34:39.987
My brother is in Debtors Anonymous.

34:41.025 --> 34:42.286
Fred?

34:43.795 --> 34:45.786
I thought that was you.
You're back.

34:45.864 --> 34:46.795
Hey, Carl.

34:46.864 --> 34:48.059
- Hi.
- What's up?

34:48.132 --> 34:49.100
How'd it go over there?

34:49.167 --> 34:50.759
Great.

34:50.835 --> 34:52.166
You know, it went great.

34:52.237 --> 34:53.534
Well, we all missed you...

34:53.605 --> 34:54.799
you know, seeing you every day.

34:55.806 --> 34:56.899
Well, I'm coming back.

34:56.975 --> 34:58.499
I'm just gonna take a few days off,

34:58.576 --> 35:00.635
and then it's nose-to-the-grindstone time.

35:00.712 --> 35:02.646
I gotta earn some money.

35:02.714 --> 35:03.772
Yeah.

35:03.848 --> 35:06.749
But, you know,
since Alan's been in charge,

35:06.818 --> 35:08.752
he's just been running
the company into the ground,

35:08.820 --> 35:10.981
and then that lawsuit...
you heard about that.

35:11.055 --> 35:12.522
No.

35:13.525 --> 35:16.392
Already laid off 60 guys, including me.

35:17.929 --> 35:19.920
Shit.

35:19.998 --> 35:22.330
They're shutting down
the whole place next month, so...

35:23.334 --> 35:24.323
Fuck.

35:25.904 --> 35:27.838
Yeah.

35:32.710 --> 35:33.870
Fuck!

35:33.945 --> 35:35.674
- Hey!
- Fuck!

35:35.747 --> 35:36.941
Oh, my goodness.

35:37.015 --> 35:38.277
Fuck!

35:38.349 --> 35:39.907
Okay, there's no need for that.

35:45.757 --> 35:47.281
Take good care of yourself.

35:47.358 --> 35:48.985
Don't drive straight through, okay?

35:49.060 --> 35:50.186
You'll get into a wreck.

35:50.261 --> 35:52.195
Not a bad idea.

35:52.263 --> 35:53.525
What?

35:53.598 --> 35:55.566
Catch a telephone pole going 90.

35:56.668 --> 35:58.135
Collect some life insurance money.

35:58.203 --> 35:59.192
No, no, no.

35:59.270 --> 36:00.498
No, no. Forget that.

36:00.572 --> 36:02.130
'Cause insurance doesn't pay for suicide.

36:02.207 --> 36:04.505
Yeah. Not if it's an accident.

36:04.576 --> 36:07.340
- Enough with the crazy talk, please.
- Yeah.

36:07.412 --> 36:08.640
- You're not being serious...
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

36:08.713 --> 36:10.271
- Okay, good. Good.
- It's just a joke.

36:10.348 --> 36:11.872
Yeah, have a nice flight.

36:11.950 --> 36:14.384
And good luck to you.

36:14.452 --> 36:16.511
- All right.
- Drive safe.

36:52.490 --> 36:54.515
- You're on the wrong side, pal.
- Yeah, I know.

36:54.592 --> 36:56.958
You know what?
It's all right, 'cause I'm driving anyway.

36:57.028 --> 36:59.258
What?

36:59.330 --> 37:00.524
We're coming with you.

37:00.598 --> 37:02.088
- No, you're not.
- Yep.

37:02.166 --> 37:03.258
Of course we are.

37:03.334 --> 37:04.631
- No, you're not. You got a...
- Yes.

37:04.702 --> 37:06.169
You have a flight to catch.

37:06.237 --> 37:08.102
We'll fly out of Salt Lake City.

37:08.172 --> 37:09.696
I feel pathetic enough, all right?

37:09.774 --> 37:12.072
Crying don't mean you're pathetic, okay?

37:12.143 --> 37:14.043
I'm fine.

37:14.112 --> 37:15.079
Yeah, you're great.

37:15.146 --> 37:16.443
That's why we're coming with you.

37:16.514 --> 37:18.846
We want to meet your whole family.

37:28.359 --> 37:29.621
This is what you gotta do.

37:29.694 --> 37:33.926
Okay, Cheaver, you gotta get
your finances in order.

37:33.998 --> 37:35.522
All right, you buy a house,

37:35.600 --> 37:37.591
you gotta have an exit plan.

37:37.669 --> 37:39.330
You gotta know how
you're gonna sell it.

37:40.705 --> 37:42.297
You're right.

37:42.373 --> 37:44.841
Hey, easy there, cowboy.

37:46.711 --> 37:48.201
It's for my back.

37:49.881 --> 37:51.075
So what you gotta do

37:51.149 --> 37:54.016
is buy an apartment house, rent it out,

37:54.085 --> 37:55.484
live in the basement for free.

37:55.553 --> 37:58.488
Six months later, you borrow on it
and buy another one.

38:00.758 --> 38:02.623
Am I still living in the basement?

38:02.694 --> 38:04.025
Absolutely.

38:05.029 --> 38:06.155
Take a left.

38:06.230 --> 38:07.959
You can get around this.

38:12.437 --> 38:13.836
Yeah, a man's gotta be indispensable.

38:13.905 --> 38:16.931
You want to move up in the world,
you gotta have skills.

38:17.008 --> 38:18.407
Basic skills.

38:18.476 --> 38:19.909
Yeah, what are your skills?

38:19.978 --> 38:21.502
Leadership.

38:21.579 --> 38:23.171
I'm a leader.

38:23.247 --> 38:24.714
Me, too.

38:24.782 --> 38:26.374
No, you're a private.

38:26.451 --> 38:28.817
That's the opposite of a leader.

38:28.886 --> 38:30.353
You know computer?

38:30.421 --> 38:31.979
Yeah, kinda.

38:32.056 --> 38:35.457
You're at a disadvantage
if you don't master computer skills.

38:36.761 --> 38:40.356
You gotta build on that.

38:40.431 --> 38:42.399
Learn a new word every day, and...

38:42.467 --> 38:44.162
get comfortable with it.

38:46.938 --> 38:49.270
Do you know where you're going here?

38:50.475 --> 38:52.340
I got a sense of it.

38:52.410 --> 38:54.844
I think you might be making your way
around to the east.

38:55.847 --> 38:57.337
No. I'm good.

38:57.415 --> 38:58.882
Cheaver, we going the right wa...

39:02.120 --> 39:03.883
Do you think he's okay?

39:03.955 --> 39:06.389
He took a ton of those pills.

39:08.593 --> 39:09.617
Cheaver!

39:11.629 --> 39:12.823
Wake up, man!

39:14.298 --> 39:15.595
Cheaver!

39:18.302 --> 39:20.827
Come on, man! Wake up!

39:20.905 --> 39:22.736
T.K., watch it!

39:29.147 --> 39:30.739
Oh, my God.

39:30.815 --> 39:32.214
Holy shit!

39:34.919 --> 39:36.887
Oh, my God.

39:36.954 --> 39:38.251
Are you all right?

39:41.659 --> 39:43.422
Yeah.

39:44.829 --> 39:46.729
Oh, my God, T.K., you're so lucky.

39:49.333 --> 39:51.597
Yeah, well...

39:51.669 --> 39:53.398
I'm a lucky guy.

39:57.575 --> 40:00.271
What the hell were you doing, T. K?

40:00.344 --> 40:02.141
- He stopped short.
- It was a red light.

40:02.213 --> 40:03.680
It was a red light.

40:05.516 --> 40:06.574
There's nothing I could do.
He stopped...

40:06.651 --> 40:08.619
I can't fucking afford it!

40:09.687 --> 40:11.120
Hey, guys.

40:13.424 --> 40:15.016
I think it opened up.

40:18.296 --> 40:19.854
Come on, keep pressure on it.

40:23.634 --> 40:26.364
They said a left at Templeton.

40:26.437 --> 40:28.234
Did you see Templeton?

40:31.843 --> 40:33.435
There it is.

40:38.516 --> 40:40.006
What the hell?

40:41.552 --> 40:43.452
We need a doctor.

40:43.521 --> 40:45.546
Well, the doctor isn't in till 3:00,

40:45.623 --> 40:46.920
so you're gonna have to wait.

40:46.991 --> 40:48.856
Oh, it can't wait.
Is there a nurse?

40:48.926 --> 40:50.154
No.

40:50.228 --> 40:51.160
You know what?

40:51.229 --> 40:52.161
I'm gonna treat her myself.

40:52.230 --> 40:53.162
What do you mean?

40:53.231 --> 40:54.994
I'm a doctor. An Army medic.

40:55.066 --> 40:56.966
You can't just go in there!

40:58.035 --> 40:59.263
You have to wait!

41:06.244 --> 41:08.405
Yikes.

41:08.479 --> 41:10.606
Here, you're gonna
have to take off your pants.

41:10.681 --> 41:12.205
Yeah.

41:19.190 --> 41:21.090
- Does that hurt?
- It's okay.

41:28.733 --> 41:30.894
Have you ever done this before?

41:32.236 --> 41:34.204
No.

41:34.272 --> 41:38.106
But sometimes you gotta put things out

41:38.176 --> 41:39.837
just to get things done, you know?

41:41.445 --> 41:43.003
Mm-hmm.

41:44.015 --> 41:44.982
You're gonna be fine.

41:51.122 --> 41:52.350
Hey, thanks.

41:52.423 --> 41:53.788
No problem.

41:58.462 --> 42:01.056
Hey, you mind if I use your phone?

42:06.737 --> 42:07.669
Hey, babe.

42:07.738 --> 42:08.762
Sorry I missed you,

42:08.840 --> 42:11.172
and I do miss you,

42:11.242 --> 42:16.771
but I'm gonna be
another day or two, so...

42:16.848 --> 42:17.872
I love you. Okay.

42:17.949 --> 42:19.507
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

42:29.026 --> 42:31.426
How you doing, Cheaver?

42:32.830 --> 42:34.422
I'm okay.

42:34.498 --> 42:36.523
Yeah, you gotta give us those pills.

42:36.601 --> 42:37.932
We're not gonna let you off yourself.

42:41.672 --> 42:44.505
If you kill yourself, Cheaver,
do you know where you go?

42:48.379 --> 42:49.368
Hell?

42:50.681 --> 42:51.943
Worse.

42:52.016 --> 42:53.643
The Lake of Fire.

42:53.718 --> 42:54.650
Lake of Fire?

42:54.719 --> 42:55.651
Yeah.

42:55.720 --> 42:57.051
You don't want to go there.

42:59.857 --> 43:01.347
I feel like I'm in it.

43:03.261 --> 43:05.195
Hello.

43:05.263 --> 43:06.321
Theodore?

43:06.397 --> 43:07.887
Yeah.

43:07.965 --> 43:09.899
I think it's your girlfriend.

43:09.967 --> 43:12.527
Hey, baby. How are you?

43:14.205 --> 43:15.229
No. No.

43:15.306 --> 43:16.864
No, the other guy got shot in the leg.

43:16.941 --> 43:19.409
He's the one whose wife left him,
so we're driving him to Salt Lake City,

43:19.477 --> 43:21.468
and then I'm going right home.
Okay, babe?

43:23.881 --> 43:25.280
No, I'm with two guys.

43:27.151 --> 43:28.311
All right. Well, let...

43:28.386 --> 43:31.287
Let me call you back, okay?

43:31.355 --> 43:33.186
I love you, too, baby.

43:33.257 --> 43:35.487
Okay. All right. Bye.

43:37.862 --> 43:41.229
Oh, my Lord. You're one good liar.

43:41.299 --> 43:43.631
You know that?

43:43.701 --> 43:45.532
But just so you know,
that's not a good thing.

43:45.603 --> 43:47.298
That just makes you a big phony.

43:47.371 --> 43:48.998
Well, most of what I said was true.

43:49.073 --> 43:52.042
Except you forgot the part
about the tittie bars.

43:52.109 --> 43:53.736
That's 'cause I'm not going
to a tittie bar.

43:54.779 --> 43:57.714
Seems to me if you can't tell
your soul mate the truth,

43:57.782 --> 43:59.841
then maybe she's not
really your soul mate.

43:59.917 --> 44:02.511
I didn't say she was my soul mate.

44:02.586 --> 44:04.884
If Randy lied to me...

44:08.526 --> 44:09.618
I'd take that guitar,

44:09.694 --> 44:12.891
and I would bust it over his head
and the damn lap dancers, too.

44:12.964 --> 44:14.556
There's no lap dancer!

44:15.566 --> 44:17.534
Okay, so tell her the truth.

44:17.601 --> 44:19.501
Why can't you just tell her the truth?

44:19.570 --> 44:20.969
Forget it. Just...

44:21.038 --> 44:21.970
I don't get it.

44:22.039 --> 44:23.666
What's the big problem?

44:23.741 --> 44:25.800
- The big problem?
- Yeah.

44:25.876 --> 44:28.003
Is that I got wounded in the dick.
That's the big problem.

44:28.079 --> 44:29.239
What?

44:30.348 --> 44:31.474
But I thought you said...

44:31.549 --> 44:33.107
Yeah, and it doesn't work.

44:33.184 --> 44:35.675
I can't get it up.
Okay? You happy?

44:35.753 --> 44:37.550
No.

44:38.689 --> 44:39.917
Why are you going to Vegas?

44:39.991 --> 44:43.188
I got the name of a place in Vegas
where they got real pros,

44:43.260 --> 44:45.194
and I'm gonna see if they can get me hard.

44:45.262 --> 44:46.490
Hookers?

44:46.564 --> 44:48.691
No. High-end girls who know
how to handle special cases.

44:49.867 --> 44:51.198
Why don't you let your fiancée do it?

44:51.268 --> 44:53.236
Because she doesn't know
where I'm wounded.

44:53.304 --> 44:56.034
She's not gonna be interested
if she knows I'm not working right.

44:56.107 --> 44:58.075
- No. You don't know that.
- Yeah, I do know that.

44:58.142 --> 44:59.507
You gotta give her a chance.

44:59.577 --> 45:02.808
If it's not working,
she and I got nothing to talk about.

45:04.982 --> 45:06.244
Well...

45:06.317 --> 45:09.411
even if it doesn't work,
you can still pleasure her.

45:09.487 --> 45:10.419
That's true.

45:10.488 --> 45:13.582
Yep. He can do threesomes.

45:13.657 --> 45:14.783
With another girl.

45:14.859 --> 45:16.019
No, another guy.

45:16.093 --> 45:20.325
The guy does it with T.K.'s fiancée
while T.K. Watches.

45:20.398 --> 45:21.797
- Just...
- Colee...

45:21.866 --> 45:24.164
Or you can use a vibrator.

45:24.235 --> 45:26.795
They make 'em real lifelike these days.

45:26.871 --> 45:28.702
You can even strap it on,

45:28.773 --> 45:31.264
or, you know, they can put
this thing inside your penis.

45:31.342 --> 45:36.075
It's like a balloon, and all you gotta do
is just pump it, pump it up.

45:36.147 --> 45:37.079
- Colee?
- Yeah?

45:37.148 --> 45:38.342
Enough.

45:38.416 --> 45:41.214
Well, it's just about
how much you love her.

45:49.827 --> 45:51.886
Rent-a-car folks gave me
the go-ahead, so I can do it.

45:51.962 --> 45:54.396
But there are about five jobs ahead of you.

45:54.465 --> 45:56.490
- Shit.
- All right.

46:26.330 --> 46:29.959
So, what are you doing after Vegas?

46:30.034 --> 46:31.626
Gonna go see your mom or...

46:31.702 --> 46:33.670
I haven't spoke to my mom
in three years.

46:33.737 --> 46:35.068
No?

46:37.108 --> 46:38.302
Why not?

46:38.375 --> 46:40.707
She kicked me out
of the house when I was 16.

46:40.778 --> 46:43.246
Wanted to spend more alone time
with her boyfriend.

46:48.319 --> 46:50.549
The only people
I really want to talk to now

46:50.621 --> 46:52.680
are Randy's family.

46:52.756 --> 46:55.281
I'm gonna stay with them from now on.

46:55.359 --> 46:59.090
Well, you can use my phone,
tell them we're running late.

46:59.163 --> 47:00.960
No, that's okay.

47:01.031 --> 47:02.896
They don't even know I'm coming.

47:06.237 --> 47:07.261
They don't?

47:07.338 --> 47:09.169
Nope.

47:18.315 --> 47:21.148
You know that family
Colee's bringing the guitar to?

47:25.289 --> 47:27.450
She thinks she's gonna live with them.

47:27.525 --> 47:29.390
They're gonna be her family.

47:29.460 --> 47:33.157
That girl's living in a dream world.

47:35.533 --> 47:37.398
Plus she's got no skills.

48:01.792 --> 48:03.350
Thanks.

48:05.262 --> 48:07.162
Looks good.

48:07.231 --> 48:09.495
Where's Colee?

48:09.567 --> 48:10.625
I don't know.

48:10.701 --> 48:12.635
- That girl you were with?
- Yeah.

48:12.703 --> 48:14.864
I think she went across
the street to the church.

48:33.390 --> 48:34.789
Can I help you?

48:34.858 --> 48:37.691
We're just looking for someone.

48:37.761 --> 48:39.524
Are you friends of Colee?

48:39.597 --> 48:41.827
- Yeah.
- She told me to look out for you.

48:41.899 --> 48:43.526
Just come this way.

48:49.273 --> 48:52.765
He stopped me and then he said,
"What do you do?

48:52.843 --> 48:56.506
"What do I do?"
"What business are you in?"

48:56.580 --> 49:00.516
And it's funny 'cause I always say,
"Well, I'm in the love business. "

49:02.653 --> 49:04.518
And don't you know the Lord himself

49:04.588 --> 49:08.615
is chairman of the board
of this love business.

49:08.692 --> 49:10.751
Think about it.

49:10.828 --> 49:13.353
He is, isn't he?

49:13.430 --> 49:16.331
And so then, you've got to ask yourself,

49:16.400 --> 49:18.129
don't you want to be
in business with the Lord?

49:18.202 --> 49:20.397
Hey! Come on in.

49:20.471 --> 49:22.234
I know I sure do.

49:22.306 --> 49:23.933
'Cause the Lord takes responsibility

49:24.008 --> 49:25.635
even when you make mistakes,
doesn't he?

49:25.709 --> 49:27.006
He's really good, isn't he?

49:27.077 --> 49:29.841
That's what I call a good C.E.O.

49:29.913 --> 49:33.314
Now, in the spirit of our Lord,
who died for our sins,

49:33.384 --> 49:35.511
let's reach out to each other
with a greeting of peace.

49:35.586 --> 49:39.317
Peace be with you.

49:39.390 --> 49:41.585
- We should get out of here.
- Yeah, I know.

49:41.659 --> 49:43.126
Peace be with you.

49:46.363 --> 49:48.695
Now remember the folks behind you, too.

49:48.766 --> 49:51.530
- Don't be shy.
- Peace be with you.

49:51.602 --> 49:52.933
And if any of you are troubled,

49:53.003 --> 49:56.939
I encourage you to speak out.

49:57.007 --> 49:58.838
Testify.

50:00.944 --> 50:03.811
I'm hoping you can pray for us.

50:03.881 --> 50:08.341
We're soldiers home on leave,
and my friends here are troubled.

50:08.419 --> 50:11.115
Cheaver has a very bad back
and a broken marriage

50:11.188 --> 50:13.884
and he wants to take his own life.

50:13.957 --> 50:16.118
And T.K.'s wounded
in the private parts,

50:16.193 --> 50:19.162
which is why he's lying to his fiancée
about going to whores.

50:23.334 --> 50:27.668
Thank you, sister.

50:27.738 --> 50:28.932
Lord, bring your healing touch

50:29.006 --> 50:30.530
to Sister Margaret's arthritis...

50:32.976 --> 50:34.967
and give her daughter strength and faith

50:35.045 --> 50:37.536
in the final days of her pregnancy.

50:37.614 --> 50:38.945
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

50:40.918 --> 50:42.408
And be sure to say a prayer...

50:42.486 --> 50:43.475
Please stand, sir.

50:46.657 --> 50:47.817
Get up.

50:47.891 --> 50:49.358
It's your turn.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.332
Lord, help these soldiers,

50:59.403 --> 51:02.804
who have given so much for this country.

51:02.873 --> 51:07.003
Ease the burden of pain
from Brother Cheaver's back

51:07.077 --> 51:09.272
and heal his broken spirit.

51:09.346 --> 51:10.643
Amen.

51:10.714 --> 51:12.909
And for Brother T.K., make his wounded...

51:12.983 --> 51:15.611
whole again.

51:15.686 --> 51:17.620
Amen.

51:23.093 --> 51:25.152
You soldiers from Kansas City?

51:25.229 --> 51:26.992
No, sir.
We're just passing through.

51:27.064 --> 51:28.691
Well, I hope you're hungry.

51:28.766 --> 51:30.597
We're having quite a shindig tonight.

51:30.667 --> 51:31.998
Happens to be my birthday.

51:32.069 --> 51:33.400
Happy Birthday.

51:33.470 --> 51:34.869
That's very nice of you but...

51:34.938 --> 51:38.430
I'm Stan Tilson, and you don't need
to be polite about it.

51:38.509 --> 51:41.444
I want you folks to come and that's it.

51:45.449 --> 51:48.009
We don't have time for this.

51:48.085 --> 51:51.452
Well, you can't say no
to that kind of invitation.

51:51.522 --> 51:53.319
Half of healing is fellowship.

51:53.390 --> 51:56.223
We'll have a quick bite
and be on our way.

52:04.468 --> 52:07.164
Ah, welcome, welcome.

52:07.237 --> 52:08.761
Now, we don't start for a little while,

52:08.839 --> 52:11.501
but you folks make yourselves
right at home.

52:11.575 --> 52:15.978
What are those?

52:16.046 --> 52:17.570
Lobster.

52:19.349 --> 52:20.976
Big lobster.

52:21.051 --> 52:23.451
- Ask her for umbrellas.
- How many chairs do we need?

52:23.520 --> 52:27.047
I've got five set up here,
so I need to get a few more.

52:27.124 --> 52:29.957
Give me a hand right here.

52:31.028 --> 52:34.361
This guy's got some serious dough.

52:34.431 --> 52:35.625
Happy Birthday.

52:39.937 --> 52:42.337
Would you care for some stuffed endive?

52:42.406 --> 52:46.536
No, thank you.

52:46.610 --> 52:49.443
It really is. The place looks fabulous.

52:49.513 --> 52:52.949
I work for my dad.
I work in commodities.

52:53.016 --> 52:54.040
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:54.117 --> 52:55.914
Cool. Yeah, my dad's a drill instructor.

52:55.986 --> 52:58.181
Yeah, I got a brother stationed in Korea

52:58.255 --> 53:01.588
and another brother
who's in basic training.

53:01.658 --> 53:03.592
So your whole family's in the Army?

53:03.660 --> 53:05.992
Yeah. I mean, just about.
You know, my mom's not.

53:06.063 --> 53:08.088
Our whole family is in finance.

53:08.165 --> 53:09.291
- Cool.
- Yeah.

53:09.366 --> 53:11.664
These are the soldiers that Dad invited.

53:11.735 --> 53:12.895
This is my brother Peter.

53:12.970 --> 53:14.767
Right. Welcome home.

53:14.838 --> 53:16.430
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

53:16.507 --> 53:18.532
No, thank you.

53:18.609 --> 53:21.305
It's a big mess over there, isn't it?

53:21.378 --> 53:23.039
Well, of course it is. It's a war.

53:23.113 --> 53:24.444
War is messy.

53:24.515 --> 53:26.380
It can't be all perfect.

53:26.450 --> 53:27.542
How would you know?

53:27.618 --> 53:28.744
Well, how would you know, Peter?

53:28.819 --> 53:31.117
We don't exactly see you over there.

53:31.188 --> 53:33.884
But I'm not for the war.

53:33.957 --> 53:35.390
I don't think it's a great thing.

53:35.459 --> 53:37.552
Neither do I.

53:37.628 --> 53:38.925
Since when?

53:38.996 --> 53:40.554
I can change my mind, can't I?

53:40.631 --> 53:41.620
Like everybody else.

53:41.698 --> 53:43.928
Yeah, go ahead, change your mind.

53:44.001 --> 53:46.299
But these guys are stuck over there.

53:46.370 --> 53:48.804
That's not the point, Peter.
I mean, you don't get it.

53:48.872 --> 53:50.032
You just don't get it.

53:50.107 --> 53:52.371
You can't change your minds, can you?

53:52.442 --> 53:54.842
You can't just leave?

53:54.912 --> 53:56.436
No, not really.

53:56.513 --> 53:58.777
We do get some R&R.

53:58.849 --> 54:01.477
These guys are screwed and for what?

54:01.552 --> 54:02.644
- Guys...
- For what?

54:02.719 --> 54:04.584
Can we just argue about golf, please?

54:04.655 --> 54:06.384
There's a lot at stake over there, Peter.

54:06.456 --> 54:07.855
Yeah, a lot of money.

54:07.925 --> 54:09.893
Barbara, what's the name of that woman

54:09.960 --> 54:11.860
who's always trying to get
that Saturday morning tea time?

54:11.929 --> 54:13.726
- Angela Morton.
- Right.

54:13.797 --> 54:15.321
That's her big cause.

54:15.399 --> 54:18.163
What do you really think we're fighting for?

54:18.235 --> 54:21.295
What are you doing over there?

54:21.371 --> 54:23.839
Honestly, we're just trying to stay alive.

54:23.907 --> 54:26.068
Stay alive?

54:26.143 --> 54:27.633
I bet that's not too easy.

54:27.711 --> 54:29.406
Stay alive? Jesus Christ.

54:29.479 --> 54:31.470
If that's your attitude,
no wonder we're losing.

54:31.548 --> 54:32.810
Bob!

54:32.883 --> 54:34.282
Hey, that's nice.

54:34.351 --> 54:36.376
Well, I don't have to listen to this crap.

54:36.453 --> 54:37.818
- Come on.
- No, but you just...

54:37.888 --> 54:39.947
Can't you just shut up for once?

54:40.023 --> 54:43.186
- What?
- You always do this.

54:43.260 --> 54:44.192
I'm sorry.

54:44.261 --> 54:45.250
It's okay.

54:45.329 --> 54:46.261
It's fine.

54:46.330 --> 54:48.696
Parties are supposed to be fun.

54:53.036 --> 54:55.766
White wine, please.

54:58.141 --> 55:00.302
So you're a soldier, huh?

55:01.778 --> 55:03.302
Used to be.

55:03.380 --> 55:06.008
You saw a lot?

55:06.083 --> 55:08.017
Enough.

55:08.085 --> 55:11.919
So they have girls in the military now?

55:11.989 --> 55:13.616
Yes, ma'am.

55:13.690 --> 55:15.214
Is that your friend?

55:16.526 --> 55:17.925
The girl I'm with?

55:17.995 --> 55:20.520
We're sharing a car.

55:23.033 --> 55:24.227
You married?

55:27.904 --> 55:31.067
I'm separated.

55:31.141 --> 55:33.507
You?

55:35.078 --> 55:37.569
What's that mean?

55:39.082 --> 55:41.050
It means "mmm. "

55:46.823 --> 55:48.586
Okay.

55:49.626 --> 55:52.094
Do you know how to dance?

55:52.162 --> 55:54.687
As a matter of fact, I do.

56:19.456 --> 56:21.856
Cheaver's got some skills.

56:21.925 --> 56:23.415
I think she likes him.

56:30.967 --> 56:32.662
Do you wanna dance?

56:32.736 --> 56:34.727
Can you dance?

56:36.573 --> 56:38.302
Of course I can dance.

56:38.375 --> 56:40.707
Nah, I meant your leg.

56:41.878 --> 56:44.676
Oh, yeah.

56:44.748 --> 56:47.182
I don't know. We could try.

56:47.250 --> 56:49.218
Does it hurt?

56:49.286 --> 56:51.584
Yeah, a little, I guess.

56:51.655 --> 56:55.318
I think if you put your foot on mine...

56:55.392 --> 56:56.882
Put my foot on yours?

56:56.960 --> 56:58.552
Yeah.

56:58.628 --> 57:00.391
- Like, on your toes?
- Sure.

57:00.464 --> 57:02.432
- How's that?
- Yeah.

57:02.499 --> 57:04.990
- We can try that.
- All right.

57:07.237 --> 57:09.034
- Yeah, that helps it.
- Does it?

57:09.106 --> 57:10.596
Okay.

57:14.111 --> 57:16.841
Wow.

57:16.913 --> 57:18.005
What?

57:21.017 --> 57:25.181
You actually know how to be nice.

57:52.149 --> 57:54.549
Where'd Cheaver go?

57:54.618 --> 57:55.607
I don't know.

57:59.156 --> 58:00.680
Cheaver?

58:07.197 --> 58:08.755
Where the hell is he?

58:10.467 --> 58:12.526
Maybe he went home with that woman.

58:12.602 --> 58:14.297
He better not have.

58:14.371 --> 58:16.965
Oh, come on.
Give the guy a break.

58:17.040 --> 58:18.098
Cheaver!

58:29.653 --> 58:30.881
Nah, I don't want to stay here.

58:30.954 --> 58:34.549
Hey! These people are nice.

58:34.624 --> 58:36.148
And we gotta sleep sometime.

58:36.226 --> 58:38.285
Yeah, you could have slept
while I was driving.

58:38.361 --> 58:39.828
Look, we'll find Cheaver in the morning

58:39.896 --> 58:42.194
and then we'll get going, okay?

58:42.265 --> 58:44.392
I think these are the guest rooms.

58:44.467 --> 58:45.764
I'm gonna take this one.

58:45.836 --> 58:47.428
- Okay.
- Okay.

58:47.504 --> 58:48.801
All right.

58:52.342 --> 58:54.776
- Good night.
- Good night.

59:51.334 --> 59:52.596
Oh, my...

59:52.669 --> 59:55.661
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

01:00:04.447 --> 01:00:06.210
I think I found Cheaver.

01:00:08.985 --> 01:00:11.078
Oh, yeah.

01:00:25.101 --> 01:00:26.693
I think I'm fixing to come!

01:00:35.045 --> 01:00:36.376
Don't stop.

01:00:36.446 --> 01:00:37.743
Who's that?

01:00:37.814 --> 01:00:39.179
It's just my husband.

01:00:39.249 --> 01:00:40.546
- What?
- Don't stop.

01:00:40.617 --> 01:00:42.107
Keep going.

01:00:42.185 --> 01:00:43.652
Give it to her good, soldier.

01:00:46.423 --> 01:00:47.754
There's someone else in there.

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:03.164
Cheaver, that woman wanted
to make a train with you.

01:01:04.574 --> 01:01:06.064
Do you still want to kill yourself?

01:01:06.142 --> 01:01:07.939
Not at the moment.

01:01:08.011 --> 01:01:09.069
There's still hope, you know.

01:01:09.145 --> 01:01:10.635
That woman wanted you.

01:01:10.714 --> 01:01:12.147
Yeah, and that man wanted you, too.

01:01:12.215 --> 01:01:13.477
It's not funny.

01:01:15.885 --> 01:01:17.944
"I think I'm fixin' to come!"

01:01:39.809 --> 01:01:43.404
I told this guy in the band
about Randy's guitar,

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.005
and he thinks it might
be worth thousands of dollars

01:01:46.082 --> 01:01:48.414
or maybe even more.

01:01:48.485 --> 01:01:51.010
- Great.
- Whatever.

01:02:09.205 --> 01:02:11.673
It'd be nice to go hiking
when we get to the Rockies,

01:02:11.741 --> 01:02:13.333
don't you think?

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:14.434
Have a picnic.

01:02:14.511 --> 01:02:16.843
No.

01:02:55.151 --> 01:02:58.780
Denver, Colorado.

01:03:12.735 --> 01:03:14.293
Where are we?

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:16.201
What are you doing?

01:03:16.272 --> 01:03:17.762
You'll see.

01:03:37.994 --> 01:03:40.121
It's a good one.

01:03:40.196 --> 01:03:43.188
I know a guy who'd come over here right now
and give you ten grand for it.

01:03:43.266 --> 01:03:44.426
10 grand?

01:03:44.501 --> 01:03:45.763
10 grand.

01:03:45.835 --> 01:03:47.564
But...

01:03:47.637 --> 01:03:52.472
it looks like someone
just got 22 at auction.

01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:57.140
$22,000?

01:03:57.213 --> 01:03:59.613
It's a very special instrument
you've got there.

01:03:59.682 --> 01:04:01.377
Yes, sir.

01:04:05.088 --> 01:04:06.749
Jeez.

01:04:06.823 --> 01:04:10.259
$22,000!

01:04:10.326 --> 01:04:13.159
You didn't believe me.

01:04:13.229 --> 01:04:16.494
No, I thought it was just a stolen guitar.

01:04:16.566 --> 01:04:17.590
It's not stolen.

01:04:17.667 --> 01:04:19.134
It belonged to his daddy.

01:04:19.202 --> 01:04:20.760
But he stole something, right?

01:04:20.837 --> 01:04:22.532
Yeah, he robbed a casino.

01:04:22.605 --> 01:04:24.163
Lucky Jim's.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.434
That's right.

01:04:25.508 --> 01:04:26.770
Walked in there by himself,

01:04:26.843 --> 01:04:28.868
and he walked out with $50,000.

01:04:28.945 --> 01:04:32.847
So Randy was, like, a bad ass, right?

01:04:32.916 --> 01:04:34.144
Yeah.

01:04:34.217 --> 01:04:36.048
He was a good person, too, you know.

01:04:36.119 --> 01:04:37.552
Came from a great family.

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:41.317
- He just robbed a little bit, is that it?
- Hello?

01:04:41.391 --> 01:04:43.951
- Hey, Scott.
- Why'd he start robbing?

01:04:44.027 --> 01:04:46.086
He just got, you know,
into a little bit of trouble.

01:04:46.162 --> 01:04:49.689
Well, your mom and me have...

01:04:49.766 --> 01:04:53.600
some things we have to sort out.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.840
No, no, it has nothing to do with that.

01:04:58.908 --> 01:05:00.569
You're going to Stanford.

01:05:00.643 --> 01:05:03.544
We're gonna get you to Stanford.

01:05:03.613 --> 01:05:05.945
No.

01:05:06.015 --> 01:05:09.075
No, no, no.
That is not a good idea.

01:05:09.152 --> 01:05:11.620
No. Do not do that.

01:05:11.688 --> 01:05:13.485
I will get you the money.

01:05:13.556 --> 01:05:16.218
I will take care of it.
I said I will and I will.

01:05:16.292 --> 01:05:20.251
Promise me you will not do that.

01:05:22.498 --> 01:05:24.864
All right.

01:05:24.934 --> 01:05:28.768
I'll call you later.

01:05:29.906 --> 01:05:32.466
All right. And...

01:05:32.542 --> 01:05:33.474
I love you.

01:05:33.543 --> 01:05:34.908
Fuck.

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.807
So what's up?

01:05:39.983 --> 01:05:43.680
Kid thinks he's got it all figured out.

01:05:43.753 --> 01:05:46.847
He's gonna get the money by enlisting
in the fucking Army.

01:05:46.923 --> 01:05:48.823
$20,000 signing bonus,

01:05:48.891 --> 01:05:50.950
has to put off college
for God knows how many years,

01:05:51.027 --> 01:05:52.517
but he's okay with that.

01:05:53.696 --> 01:05:55.926
Well, that sounds like a pretty good idea.

01:05:55.999 --> 01:05:57.523
That is not a good idea.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.033
They'll send him right over there.

01:05:59.102 --> 01:06:00.330
I'm not gonna let that happen.

01:06:03.473 --> 01:06:04.906
Maybe he could go to a state school.

01:06:04.974 --> 01:06:07.101
No. You got a shot at Stanford,

01:06:07.176 --> 01:06:08.234
you go to Stanford.

01:06:08.311 --> 01:06:09.676
Exactly.

01:06:11.648 --> 01:06:16.915
The problem is you can't
go there for free, you know.

01:06:16.986 --> 01:06:19.648
I gotta get the money.
Get the money.

01:06:19.722 --> 01:06:23.419
I'm gonna just...
I'll get the money.

01:06:27.096 --> 01:06:29.326
I'm worried about you, Cheaver.

01:06:32.235 --> 01:06:33.566
I'll figure something out.

01:06:33.636 --> 01:06:36.935
If you're so worried about him,
why don't you give him that guitar of yours?

01:06:37.006 --> 01:06:40.203
What? I can't give him Randy's guitar.

01:06:40.276 --> 01:06:42.369
Why not? It's a stolen guitar.

01:06:42.445 --> 01:06:43.912
It's not stolen.

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.279
It belongs to his family.

01:06:47.350 --> 01:06:49.875
Besides, I mean, I don't see
the problem, you know.

01:06:49.952 --> 01:06:52.512
I enlisted and I went over there.

01:06:52.588 --> 01:06:54.078
Yeah, but what choice did you have?

01:06:54.157 --> 01:06:57.957
And if I was gonna sell the guitar,
don't you think I'd use it

01:06:58.027 --> 01:06:59.619
to pay for my own goddamn college?

01:06:59.696 --> 01:07:01.323
Yeah, but it wouldn't be Stanford.

01:07:01.397 --> 01:07:03.922
You don't know that.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.696
Come on, the guy's gonna kill himself
if you don't give him that guitar.

01:07:06.769 --> 01:07:09.602
I'm not gonna kill myself,
and I don't need your guitar.

01:07:09.672 --> 01:07:11.333
All right, what are you gonna do then?

01:07:11.407 --> 01:07:12.999
I'm gonna skip Salt Lake,

01:07:13.076 --> 01:07:15.169
I'm gonna go to Vegas with you guys,

01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:17.872
I'm gonna borrow some money
off my credit card,

01:07:17.947 --> 01:07:20.245
and I'm gonna turn it into $20,000.

01:07:20.316 --> 01:07:21.908
Oh, you gonna play poker?

01:07:21.984 --> 01:07:23.849
No, I was thinking roulette.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.251
You play red and black,

01:07:25.321 --> 01:07:27.881
guess the right color three times,
I got the money.

01:07:27.957 --> 01:07:29.891
If I was you,
I'd stick to the skills games...

01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:31.654
either blackjack or Texas hold 'em.

01:07:31.728 --> 01:07:33.559
But whatever you do,
just stay away from craps.

01:07:33.629 --> 01:07:36.189
That is the stupidest idea.

01:07:36.265 --> 01:07:37.562
Why?

01:07:37.633 --> 01:07:40.033
It's crazy.

01:07:40.103 --> 01:07:42.936
You can't just go to Vegas
and make $20,000.

01:07:43.005 --> 01:07:44.302
That's just... You're dreamin'.

01:07:44.374 --> 01:07:46.239
Wait a minute. He's dreaming?

01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:47.640
Yeah.

01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:49.575
He's the one who's got the stupid idea?

01:07:49.645 --> 01:07:52.705
You're traveling
all the way across country

01:07:52.782 --> 01:07:55.307
to visit a family that you've never even met.

01:07:55.385 --> 01:07:57.649
Like, they don't know you're coming.

01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.984
They don't even know you exist.

01:08:00.056 --> 01:08:01.990
You think they're gonna
love you or take care of you?

01:08:02.058 --> 01:08:04.026
Like, he's not the one who's dreaming.

01:08:06.796 --> 01:08:07.728
Christ.

01:08:07.797 --> 01:08:09.822
Are you...

01:08:09.899 --> 01:08:11.332
You gotta be kiddin...

01:08:11.401 --> 01:08:13.392
I don't want him to lose his money.

01:08:13.469 --> 01:08:17.064
Listen. Don't worry about me, okay?

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.573
Don't worry about me.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.471
I have to give 'em the guitar.

01:08:20.542 --> 01:08:23.444
I have to give it to them.

01:08:23.513 --> 01:08:26.345
- But they don't even know you.
- I don't know you!

01:08:26.416 --> 01:08:30.182
Whoever heard of giving $20,000
to someone that you just met?

01:08:30.252 --> 01:08:33.245
Yeah, but the guy's desperate.
He's all fucked up.

01:08:33.322 --> 01:08:34.482
Enough.

01:08:34.557 --> 01:08:36.024
I can pay for my own kid's college.

01:08:36.091 --> 01:08:37.821
I'm just trying to help you, man.

01:08:37.894 --> 01:08:39.361
You wanna talk about fucked up?

01:08:39.429 --> 01:08:40.862
Look in the mirror.

01:08:43.366 --> 01:08:45.560
I'm not the one trying to kill myself, buddy.

01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:17.194
Colee...

01:09:17.265 --> 01:09:18.563
Colee stop crying.

01:09:18.634 --> 01:09:21.626
I can't give you the guitar.

01:09:21.703 --> 01:09:24.399
I can't give it to you.

01:09:24.474 --> 01:09:26.908
I know. It's okay.

01:09:26.975 --> 01:09:30.173
It's not okay.

01:09:30.246 --> 01:09:33.374
I want to give it to you,
but then I won't have...

01:09:34.617 --> 01:09:37.609
I won't have anywhere to go.

01:09:47.897 --> 01:09:51.094
Colee. Come on, Colee.

01:09:51.167 --> 01:09:52.964
All right, listen.

01:09:53.035 --> 01:09:56.163
How about you stop crying
and we'll stop.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.400
What do you mean?

01:09:58.474 --> 01:10:00.374
You been wanting to sightsee, right?

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:02.707
Yeah.

01:10:02.778 --> 01:10:05.611
Okay, so we'll go somewhere,
do something.

01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:09.750
Could we have a picnic?

01:10:11.287 --> 01:10:12.481
Yeah, a picnic. Whatever.

01:10:12.555 --> 01:10:13.579
Yeah.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.550
You know, you can leave
your guitar in the car.

01:10:46.622 --> 01:10:48.556
I'm not gonna steal it.

01:10:49.825 --> 01:10:52.293
Well, you might not think you are,

01:10:52.361 --> 01:10:53.953
but I'm not chancing it.

01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:56.260
I don't want to get ditched.

01:10:56.332 --> 01:10:58.323
Why? Does that happen to you a lot?

01:11:02.238 --> 01:11:04.468
Look at these rocks.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.201
That's a skipping rock.

01:11:06.275 --> 01:11:07.606
That would go far, huh?

01:11:07.677 --> 01:11:09.144
Yep.

01:11:09.211 --> 01:11:11.145
Hey, that's a fossil.

01:11:11.213 --> 01:11:12.271
That's a nice one.

01:11:12.348 --> 01:11:14.578
- It is?
- A mollusk. See?

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.045
The poor little guy
winds up getting squished

01:11:20.122 --> 01:11:22.181
between two rocks.

01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:31.361
Why do we have to go back?

01:11:33.736 --> 01:11:36.671
I like it here. It's fun.

01:12:11.674 --> 01:12:14.006
Oh, fuck.

01:12:14.076 --> 01:12:16.943
- T.K.
- What?

01:12:17.013 --> 01:12:18.275
Guess what.

01:12:18.347 --> 01:12:19.746
What?

01:12:22.051 --> 01:12:25.043
I got your problem solved.

01:12:25.121 --> 01:12:27.555
What problem?

01:12:27.623 --> 01:12:30.615
I was in the bathroom

01:12:30.693 --> 01:12:33.218
and I met these real nice girls,

01:12:33.295 --> 01:12:35.786
and they travel around
in that RV over there.

01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:39.963
And what they do
is they're sex workers.

01:12:40.036 --> 01:12:41.628
But they're real professional.

01:12:41.704 --> 01:12:43.865
And I told them about
your problem and they said...

01:12:43.939 --> 01:12:47.397
- You gotta stop telling people that!
- But they said they could take care of it.

01:12:47.476 --> 01:12:48.841
And they said they'd give you a discount

01:12:48.911 --> 01:12:50.674
'cause you're a serviceman
wounded in the war.

01:12:50.746 --> 01:12:52.179
Sounds like a good deal to me.

01:12:52.248 --> 01:12:54.443
That's what I thought.

01:12:55.451 --> 01:12:57.248
What do you think?

01:13:05.227 --> 01:13:06.592
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

01:13:06.662 --> 01:13:09.392
- Hi.
- So here he is.

01:13:09.465 --> 01:13:10.693
This is T.K.

01:13:10.766 --> 01:13:14.258
T.K., this is Brandi,
Kendra and Savannah.

01:13:14.336 --> 01:13:15.928
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:16.005 --> 01:13:17.404
So how does this work?

01:13:17.473 --> 01:13:19.498
Does he just pick one of you or...

01:13:19.575 --> 01:13:21.770
Yep, or he can have all three.

01:13:23.245 --> 01:13:24.303
How much?

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:27.110
He's so cute, I'll do it for free.

01:13:27.183 --> 01:13:28.707
For free?

01:13:28.784 --> 01:13:29.773
How does that sound?

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.085
Don't worry. She'll get it going.

01:13:33.155 --> 01:13:34.747
If she can't, nobody can.

01:13:36.492 --> 01:13:38.687
You come with me.

01:13:40.129 --> 01:13:41.221
Okay.

01:13:43.399 --> 01:13:44.525
You're all right?

01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:50.167
We're here for ya.

01:13:57.546 --> 01:13:58.911
- Colee?
- Yeah?

01:13:58.981 --> 01:14:00.346
Come on.

01:14:03.452 --> 01:14:04.919
You all right?

01:14:06.188 --> 01:14:08.122
Yeah.

01:14:09.225 --> 01:14:11.989
- What?
- Colee.

01:14:12.061 --> 01:14:14.529
No good deed goes unpunished.

01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:22.531
- What's wrong?
- I got to...

01:14:22.605 --> 01:14:23.572
You getting cold feet?

01:14:23.639 --> 01:14:25.334
No, I gotta get something in my stomach...

01:14:25.407 --> 01:14:26.772
What's the problem?

01:14:26.842 --> 01:14:29.276
I haven't eaten anything except a hot dog
in the last 24 hours.

01:14:29.345 --> 01:14:31.006
So what? Eat later.

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.741
Well, I need to up my electrolytes.

01:14:32.815 --> 01:14:34.214
You know, I need
a PowerBar or a Gatorade...

01:14:34.283 --> 01:14:35.807
Okay. Do you have anything like that?

01:14:35.885 --> 01:14:39.753
No. We just got Coke and tossed salad

01:14:39.822 --> 01:14:41.517
and Marlboro Lights.

01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:43.581
Hey, T.K., I saw a store on the way in.

01:14:43.659 --> 01:14:45.559
All right, well...

01:14:45.628 --> 01:14:48.961
I guess they're gonna go to the store.

01:14:50.866 --> 01:14:53.733
Get me a fried egg sandwich on a roll!

01:15:02.278 --> 01:15:03.973
Are you mad at me?

01:15:04.046 --> 01:15:06.412
No.

01:15:06.482 --> 01:15:08.643
I'm sorry.

01:15:08.717 --> 01:15:11.880
I was just trying to help.

01:15:11.954 --> 01:15:13.979
I should just keep my big mouth shut.

01:15:14.056 --> 01:15:15.853
Don't worry about it.

01:15:21.997 --> 01:15:24.158
Wow, look at those clouds.

01:15:42.017 --> 01:15:43.951
Wow, it's really coming down.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.019
That's a good one.

01:16:05.407 --> 01:16:07.102
This is unbelievable.

01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:30.230
Wow.

01:16:36.338 --> 01:16:37.999
Holy shit.

01:16:38.073 --> 01:16:40.371
Holy shit is right.

01:16:44.546 --> 01:16:45.979
Get out of the car.

01:16:47.349 --> 01:16:48.577
I'm not getting out of the car.

01:16:48.651 --> 01:16:50.175
You stay in this car you might die.

01:16:50.252 --> 01:16:51.981
If I leave the car I might die.

01:16:52.054 --> 01:16:55.546
T.K., open the door and get out.

01:17:25.087 --> 01:17:27.988
It's okay.

01:17:28.057 --> 01:17:30.685
You're gonna be fine.

01:17:45.541 --> 01:17:49.841
Okay. Is it gone?

01:17:49.912 --> 01:17:52.813
Oh, my God.

01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:54.348
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:17:54.416 --> 01:17:56.077
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

01:17:56.151 --> 01:17:58.676
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:18:00.723 --> 01:18:02.520
- Is it working?
- What?

01:18:02.591 --> 01:18:04.149
Is it working?

01:18:04.226 --> 01:18:06.160
As a matter of fact, yeah, I think...

01:18:06.228 --> 01:18:08.958
Yeah, it's working
pretty good right now, so...

01:18:09.031 --> 01:18:11.261
That's great.

01:18:11.333 --> 01:18:13.267
Oh, no. Okay.

01:18:13.335 --> 01:18:14.302
Yeah, that's working.

01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:17.737
That's great.

01:18:17.806 --> 01:18:20.172
Yep.

01:18:20.242 --> 01:18:23.507
Wow.

01:18:23.579 --> 01:18:25.376
We should get out.

01:18:40.596 --> 01:18:42.063
Hey, chief!

01:18:42.131 --> 01:18:43.223
Guess what.

01:18:43.298 --> 01:18:44.230
What?

01:18:44.299 --> 01:18:46.028
His penis works.

01:18:46.101 --> 01:18:48.296
What do you mean?
You got wood?

01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:51.134
Yeah. Definitely wood.

01:18:51.206 --> 01:18:53.003
So we don't need
these ladies anymore?

01:18:53.075 --> 01:18:55.805
Nope. He's all fixed up.

01:18:55.878 --> 01:18:57.778
He could pound a nail with that thing.

01:18:57.846 --> 01:18:59.677
Pound a nail?

01:18:59.748 --> 01:19:01.272
How do you know that?
Did you touch it?

01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:03.978
No, I didn't have to.
It was just pokin' right into me.

01:19:04.053 --> 01:19:05.782
It's a miracle.

01:19:05.854 --> 01:19:08.345
You are one lucky bastard, T.K.

01:19:19.435 --> 01:19:20.459
You all right?

01:19:20.536 --> 01:19:22.902
Yeah, you don't seem too happy...

01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:24.233
considering.

01:19:24.306 --> 01:19:26.274
I'm all right.

01:19:26.341 --> 01:19:27.569
Yeah, I get to see my girlfriend,

01:19:27.643 --> 01:19:29.907
go back down range
like nothing ever happened.

01:19:29.978 --> 01:19:32.412
T.K., what are you worried about?

01:19:32.481 --> 01:19:33.948
You're on a lucky streak.

01:19:34.016 --> 01:19:35.643
I don't think so.

01:19:35.717 --> 01:19:37.844
I mean, you can only get lucky
for so long, you know?

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.150
Streaks don't last forever,
and I've been burnin' some karma.

01:19:40.222 --> 01:19:42.690
Hey, you can't think that way.

01:19:42.758 --> 01:19:44.749
It's gonna mess your head up,
get you in trouble over there.

01:19:44.827 --> 01:19:48.319
Yeah, you gotta forget about luck.

01:19:48.397 --> 01:19:50.456
I mean, look at Randy.

01:19:50.532 --> 01:19:52.966
Robbing Lucky Jim's, not getting caught.

01:19:53.035 --> 01:19:55.629
That was lucky. Amazing.

01:19:55.704 --> 01:19:59.140
But maybe if he had have got caught,

01:19:59.208 --> 01:20:01.938
he would have gone to jail
and he wouldn't have enlisted,

01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:03.034
and then he might be alive.

01:20:03.112 --> 01:20:05.137
That might be luckier.

01:20:05.214 --> 01:20:07.876
So, you know, just don't think about luck.

01:20:09.852 --> 01:20:12.514
I'm on my third tour.
The odds aren't good.

01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:18.848
Maybe you need to change the odds.

01:20:18.927 --> 01:20:20.417
Maybe you don't go back.

01:20:21.964 --> 01:20:23.124
You can go to Canada.

01:20:23.198 --> 01:20:24.392
Take a break.

01:20:24.466 --> 01:20:27.765
No, I can't go to Canada, man.

01:20:27.836 --> 01:20:29.463
You're a coward if you go to Canada.

01:20:29.538 --> 01:20:32.132
Yeah, but you're a coward that's alive.

01:20:32.207 --> 01:20:34.038
Plus you've done your service.

01:20:34.109 --> 01:20:36.339
Given a lot.
More than most people.

01:20:36.411 --> 01:20:37.537
I can't do it, you know.

01:20:37.613 --> 01:20:39.171
They got shit football in Canada.

01:20:39.248 --> 01:20:40.545
Become a hockey fan.

01:20:40.616 --> 01:20:42.607
No.

01:20:42.684 --> 01:20:44.311
I don't know anyone up there, anyway.

01:20:44.386 --> 01:20:45.478
We'll come visit you.

01:20:45.554 --> 01:20:47.419
I've never been to Canada.

01:20:47.489 --> 01:20:49.150
- Yeah.
- Nah.

01:20:49.224 --> 01:20:51.192
- Yeah.
- I'm good.

01:21:36.205 --> 01:21:38.230
Hey! There's Lucky Jim's.

01:21:41.176 --> 01:21:44.236
Robbing a casino's a ballsy thing to do.

01:21:44.313 --> 01:21:45.940
In a weird way, you gotta admire it.

01:21:46.014 --> 01:21:49.950
You know, he was wearing
a gorilla mask when he did it.

01:21:50.018 --> 01:21:52.077
On Halloween
about three years ago.

01:21:52.154 --> 01:21:55.385
Nobody even looked twice
at a guy running down the street

01:21:55.457 --> 01:21:57.288
wearing a mask and carrying a gun.

01:22:07.636 --> 01:22:09.831
I'm happy for you, T.K.

01:22:09.905 --> 01:22:12.373
You know, you're going home
to your girlfriend,

01:22:12.441 --> 01:22:14.102
and that's gonna be real nice.

01:22:14.176 --> 01:22:16.644
You just treat her right.

01:22:16.712 --> 01:22:17.644
Okay.

01:22:17.713 --> 01:22:19.112
When you get married,

01:22:19.181 --> 01:22:21.672
let me know 'cause I want
to send you something.

01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:23.479
You got lots of celebrating to do.

01:22:23.552 --> 01:22:26.350
You got your bridal shower
and your engagement party...

01:22:26.421 --> 01:22:27.353
All right, Colee.

01:22:27.422 --> 01:22:28.912
- Rehearsal dinner...
- Stop, stop, stop.

01:22:28.991 --> 01:22:31.323
It's gonna be nice.

01:22:31.393 --> 01:22:33.987
Just take care.

01:22:37.933 --> 01:22:39.958
That was a bit forward.

01:22:41.236 --> 01:22:42.635
Good luck at the tables.

01:22:42.704 --> 01:22:43.796
Listen to me.

01:22:43.872 --> 01:22:46.568
You go home,
do what you need to do there.

01:22:46.642 --> 01:22:48.803
If I were you, I'd think twice
about going back.

01:22:50.579 --> 01:22:52.706
Well, if I go home, I'm going back.

01:22:52.781 --> 01:22:56.911
You know, my whole family's in the Army,
so it's almost the same thing.

01:22:59.755 --> 01:23:02.315
Well, see you guys.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:16.162
So, uh, you sure you don't want me
to drive you over to Randy's?

01:23:16.238 --> 01:23:18.900
No, I gotta do this by myself.

01:23:18.974 --> 01:23:20.202
Thanks.

01:23:20.275 --> 01:23:22.209
I'll take a taxi.

01:23:22.277 --> 01:23:24.268
Well, if you need anything,

01:23:24.346 --> 01:23:26.075
you give me a call.

01:23:26.148 --> 01:23:27.706
All right?

01:23:29.918 --> 01:23:33.251
I'm real sorry about that guitar.

01:23:33.322 --> 01:23:34.880
Forget it.

01:23:36.491 --> 01:23:38.322
You bring it to them.

01:23:40.362 --> 01:23:42.125
They're gonna love you.

01:23:52.674 --> 01:23:56.940
...worried about blowing up
some abandoned Iraqi tanks

01:23:57.012 --> 01:23:58.604
and other personnel carriers...

01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:59.612
What'll it be?

01:23:59.681 --> 01:24:02.809
Can I get a shot of tequila?

01:24:02.884 --> 01:24:07.082
Suddenly, out of an alleyway, wham!

01:24:07.155 --> 01:24:10.682
There comes an RPG
and missiles from the air.

01:24:10.759 --> 01:24:12.989
We have been trying
to get a live report...

01:24:13.061 --> 01:24:14.926
Can you make that a double?

01:24:41.223 --> 01:24:42.781
- Yes?
- Hi.

01:24:42.858 --> 01:24:45.986
I'm Colee Dunn.

01:24:46.061 --> 01:24:47.961
I was a friend of Randy's.

01:24:48.029 --> 01:24:50.896
We served together and...

01:24:50.966 --> 01:24:52.991
this is his guitar.

01:24:57.806 --> 01:24:59.273
Well, come in.

01:24:59.341 --> 01:25:01.605
And these flowers are for you, too.

01:25:04.312 --> 01:25:06.177
Thank you.

01:25:06.248 --> 01:25:08.648
We love flowers.

01:25:11.453 --> 01:25:13.944
Here we are.

01:25:14.022 --> 01:25:17.822
You know, you have
such a beautiful home.

01:25:17.893 --> 01:25:19.258
Thanks.

01:25:21.797 --> 01:25:22.764
I guess you didn't...

01:25:22.831 --> 01:25:26.096
you didn't really need the flowers.

01:25:26.168 --> 01:25:29.501
Well, we're always happy for more.

01:25:29.571 --> 01:25:31.937
We have a flower
wholesaling business, so...

01:25:32.007 --> 01:25:34.703
Randy probably told you that.

01:25:34.776 --> 01:25:36.266
Of course, he never liked working there.

01:25:36.344 --> 01:25:38.403
You know boys.

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:42.883
Always trying to prove they're men.

01:25:42.951 --> 01:25:44.418
I guess working in a flower shop

01:25:44.486 --> 01:25:48.252
didn't quite go with that.

01:25:48.323 --> 01:25:49.950
I must say, I didn't even know

01:25:50.025 --> 01:25:52.493
that Randy played the guitar.

01:25:54.129 --> 01:25:56.757
I thought that...

01:25:56.832 --> 01:25:59.198
I thought that
maybe you gave it to him.

01:26:03.305 --> 01:26:05.034
It wasn't in your family?

01:26:05.106 --> 01:26:06.164
No.

01:26:06.241 --> 01:26:09.608
Our family was never too musical.

01:26:09.678 --> 01:26:13.170
So I don't know where he would have
gotten such a nice guitar.

01:26:16.451 --> 01:26:18.612
That's funny.

01:26:42.944 --> 01:26:44.434
How are you doing today, sir?

01:26:46.114 --> 01:26:47.911
I'll know in about 30 minutes.

01:26:50.252 --> 01:26:52.311
Never too old to sign up.

01:26:52.387 --> 01:26:55.356
You ever think about it?

01:26:55.423 --> 01:26:57.516
I just got out.

01:26:57.592 --> 01:26:59.321
That'd be the best time to get back in.

01:27:00.428 --> 01:27:02.089
Yeah.

01:27:10.005 --> 01:27:11.563
There you go, sweetie.

01:27:13.842 --> 01:27:15.332
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:17.776
<i>Air Canada Flight 63 for Vancouver</i>

01:27:17.846 --> 01:27:20.576
<i>will begin boarding
in approximately 45 minutes</i>

01:27:20.649 --> 01:27:22.776
<i>from Gate C29.</i>

01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:36.622
Can I help you?

01:27:36.698 --> 01:27:37.892
- No, no, no.
- No?

01:27:37.966 --> 01:27:39.160
- You sure?
- Yes.

01:27:39.234 --> 01:27:43.295
Just tell us some more
stories about Randy.

01:27:44.472 --> 01:27:46.440
Okay...

01:27:48.043 --> 01:27:51.012
All right, I'm gonna get that.
Tom, that toast is burning.

01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:02.087
Shannon, this is Colee.

01:28:02.157 --> 01:28:03.852
Colee served with Randy.

01:28:03.925 --> 01:28:06.285
Hi.

01:28:06.361 --> 01:28:09.728
And this is little Jessie.

01:28:09.798 --> 01:28:12.460
He looks just like
his daddy, don't you think?

01:28:12.534 --> 01:28:14.058
He's got Randy's eyes.

01:28:14.135 --> 01:28:17.036
But he's got a bald spot just like you.

01:28:18.139 --> 01:28:20.437
Give me that baby.

01:28:20.508 --> 01:28:23.136
Stop it.

01:28:24.245 --> 01:28:26.805
That's my boy. Yeah.

01:28:41.129 --> 01:28:42.756
How you doing?

01:28:44.499 --> 01:28:45.761
I'm good.

01:28:45.834 --> 01:28:48.564
I'm sorry, Colee.

01:28:48.637 --> 01:28:50.901
You didn't know about Shannon, did ya?

01:28:50.972 --> 01:28:54.135
Yeah, I knew.

01:28:54.209 --> 01:28:55.471
I knew about that.

01:28:55.543 --> 01:28:58.307
He's a damn fool, Randy.

01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:00.041
He never slept with the girl but once.

01:29:00.115 --> 01:29:01.639
He barely knew her.

01:29:01.716 --> 01:29:04.116
But she got pregnant.

01:29:04.185 --> 01:29:07.518
Then he disappeared
and, of course, we felt responsible.

01:29:07.589 --> 01:29:09.147
She was gonna have a baby.

01:29:14.162 --> 01:29:16.892
It doesn't change
whatever you had with Randy.

01:29:16.965 --> 01:29:19.092
Hope you know that.

01:29:25.507 --> 01:29:29.807
<i>This is the final call for Air Canada
Flight 63 to Vancouver.</i>

01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:32.103
He's looking at me to see
if it's okay to eat them.

01:30:32.173 --> 01:30:33.800
- Yes, you may eat them.
- You go right ahead.

01:30:33.875 --> 01:30:35.172
That's delicious.

01:30:38.947 --> 01:30:40.437
Hey, Colee.

01:30:40.515 --> 01:30:43.951
I just want to say

01:30:44.018 --> 01:30:47.920
that Jeanie and I
have talked about this,

01:30:47.989 --> 01:30:51.220
and seeing that you're
kind of out of touch

01:30:51.292 --> 01:30:53.760
with your own family,

01:30:53.828 --> 01:30:58.128
well, we want you to know that...

01:30:58.199 --> 01:30:59.461
that you're welcome to stay here

01:30:59.534 --> 01:31:00.865
for the rest of your leave.

01:31:00.935 --> 01:31:02.459
Really?

01:31:09.711 --> 01:31:11.440
Wow, that's...

01:31:14.983 --> 01:31:16.541
That's so nice.

01:31:18.653 --> 01:31:20.553
I have something that I want to say, too.

01:31:27.562 --> 01:31:31.555
Shannon...

01:31:31.633 --> 01:31:33.897
there's a couple things that you should know.

01:31:37.939 --> 01:31:41.932
Randy... he loved you
with all his heart and soul,

01:31:42.010 --> 01:31:45.036
and he talked about you all the time.

01:31:47.816 --> 01:31:51.775
And, you know, he knew
that he had made a big mistake

01:31:51.853 --> 01:31:54.788
and he was gonna make it up to you.

01:31:57.225 --> 01:32:00.922
And, Tom and Jeanie,
he just loved you so much.

01:32:00.995 --> 01:32:02.690
He knew what great parents you were

01:32:02.764 --> 01:32:07.633
and grandparents, too, and...

01:32:07.702 --> 01:32:11.229
and he was just so looking forward
to coming home.

01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:17.671
Ya'll have been so nice to me.

01:32:17.745 --> 01:32:19.007
And I think I should go.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.911
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, no...

01:32:20.982 --> 01:32:21.914
You can stay, can't ya?

01:32:21.983 --> 01:32:23.450
No, I think I should go.

01:32:26.955 --> 01:32:30.857
And, you know, I was thinking...

01:32:30.925 --> 01:32:33.086
would it be all right if I took that guitar?

01:32:33.161 --> 01:32:35.026
Randy's guitar?

01:32:35.096 --> 01:32:37.496
Is that okay?

01:32:39.601 --> 01:32:41.193
You take it.

01:32:43.104 --> 01:32:45.698
You're welcome to it.

01:32:47.942 --> 01:32:49.773
Thank you.

01:33:25.546 --> 01:33:26.740
Excuse me.

01:33:26.814 --> 01:33:30.113
I have a friend who I think got arrested.

01:33:30.184 --> 01:33:31.151
You just brought him in.

01:33:31.219 --> 01:33:32.743
- What's the name?
- Poole.

01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:33.844
T.K. Poole.

01:33:38.026 --> 01:33:39.926
Yeah, we got him.

01:33:39.994 --> 01:33:41.427
Can I see him?

01:33:41.496 --> 01:33:43.361
He's still being processed.
You're gonna have to wait.

01:33:45.833 --> 01:33:46.925
What'd he do?

01:33:47.001 --> 01:33:48.832
Doesn't say.

01:33:48.903 --> 01:33:51.633
Must have done something.

01:33:56.044 --> 01:33:57.011
Hello?

01:33:57.078 --> 01:33:58.477
Cheaver!

01:33:58.546 --> 01:34:00.446
Guess what. I got the guitar.

01:34:00.515 --> 01:34:02.676
I told you not to worry about that.

01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:05.218
Are you still in Vegas?
Can I come meet you?

01:34:12.093 --> 01:34:14.027
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:34:22.804 --> 01:34:24.294
How is he?

01:34:24.372 --> 01:34:25.805
They won't let me see him.

01:34:25.873 --> 01:34:28.774
Well, what did he do?

01:34:28.843 --> 01:34:30.834
I don't know.

01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:38.450
Sir? When can we see our friend?

01:34:38.519 --> 01:34:40.009
You can't.

01:34:40.088 --> 01:34:42.352
Listen, we gotta see him.

01:34:42.423 --> 01:34:44.118
He's in the Army. We all are.

01:34:44.192 --> 01:34:46.251
And he's home on leave for just 30 days.

01:34:46.327 --> 01:34:48.022
Now you might not know what that's like...

01:34:48.096 --> 01:34:50.724
I know just what that's like.

01:34:50.798 --> 01:34:52.959
I was a Marine in Desert Storm.

01:34:54.635 --> 01:34:56.865
Well, then maybe you can help us out.

01:35:05.847 --> 01:35:08.577
I have my problems
with my approach shot.

01:35:08.649 --> 01:35:10.207
Oh, see, yeah.

01:35:10.284 --> 01:35:12.252
All you gotta do is just shorten up
that back swing,

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:15.289
and I guarantee
you'll hit the green every time.

01:35:16.991 --> 01:35:18.424
That's it.

01:35:18.493 --> 01:35:19.960
Like, I don't like to brag,

01:35:20.028 --> 01:35:21.325
'cause bragging doesn't come easy to me,

01:35:21.396 --> 01:35:24.888
but, you know, last time I played
Number 4 at Kuwait City,

01:35:24.966 --> 01:35:26.456
I got a hole in one.

01:35:26.534 --> 01:35:28.559
- Aw, come on, you're bullshitting me.
- No. I'm serious.

01:35:28.636 --> 01:35:31.764
And it was amazing because
the ball never even hit the grass.

01:35:31.839 --> 01:35:34.069
It just dropped straight in the hole.

01:35:34.142 --> 01:35:35.473
There was nothing but cup.

01:35:35.543 --> 01:35:37.738
Swear...

01:35:37.812 --> 01:35:39.677
That's amazing.

01:35:39.747 --> 01:35:40.771
Beautiful, beautiful.

01:35:40.848 --> 01:35:41.872
You know these two?

01:35:43.518 --> 01:35:45.281
Yeah. Hey, guys.

01:35:45.353 --> 01:35:46.980
Hi.

01:35:47.055 --> 01:35:48.920
Hey, your friend here is a real hero.

01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:51.151
Yeah, we know, but why is he here?

01:35:51.225 --> 01:35:53.955
He's here because
he served his country honorably

01:35:54.028 --> 01:35:57.293
and then he came back
and took responsibility for a past mistake.

01:35:57.365 --> 01:35:58.662
That's as brave as it gets.

01:35:58.733 --> 01:36:00.598
What's the charge?

01:36:00.668 --> 01:36:01.760
Armed robbery.

01:36:01.836 --> 01:36:02.996
Armed robbery?

01:36:03.071 --> 01:36:04.834
What did he rob?

01:36:04.906 --> 01:36:07.875
You ever heard of a casino
called Lucky Jim's?

01:36:12.447 --> 01:36:14.312
Yeah.

01:36:14.382 --> 01:36:15.815
Yeah, I heard of that.

01:36:15.883 --> 01:36:19.478
So you robbed Lucky Jim's?

01:36:19.554 --> 01:36:22.148
Yeah.

01:36:22.223 --> 01:36:25.818
And couldn't keep it a secret anymore.

01:36:25.893 --> 01:36:28.521
The guilt was just keeping me up at night.

01:36:28.596 --> 01:36:31.121
A guy who can man up
to his past got my respect.

01:36:35.603 --> 01:36:37.662
Could we have a moment alone with him?

01:36:37.738 --> 01:36:39.603
Is that all right with you?

01:36:39.674 --> 01:36:41.164
Yeah.

01:36:46.647 --> 01:36:48.842
Lucky Jim's?

01:36:48.916 --> 01:36:50.315
Why are you doing this?

01:36:50.384 --> 01:36:53.217
Well, like you said,
I gotta do what I gotta do.

01:36:53.287 --> 01:36:55.187
Find a way to stay alive.

01:36:55.256 --> 01:36:57.554
What, to keep from going back?

01:36:57.625 --> 01:36:59.024
Yeah, it's perfect.

01:36:59.093 --> 01:37:01.561
No. You're gonna go to prison.

01:37:01.629 --> 01:37:03.961
Look at me.
Prison's gonna be easy on a guy like me.

01:37:04.031 --> 01:37:06.056
I got it all figured out.

01:37:06.134 --> 01:37:07.533
I can get a college degree in there.

01:37:07.602 --> 01:37:10.503
These guys said I'll be out in 18 months.

01:37:10.571 --> 01:37:12.664
This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:13.866
You'll be an ex-con.

01:37:13.941 --> 01:37:16.034
- Yeah, but a living ex-con.
- Right.

01:37:16.110 --> 01:37:19.102
T.K., this is crazy.

01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:20.772
Everybody okay in here?

01:37:20.848 --> 01:37:22.543
- Yep.
- Yes.

01:37:22.617 --> 01:37:25.108
You didn't get hit too hard in the head
fighting over there, did ya?

01:37:25.186 --> 01:37:26.312
No, sir. No.

01:37:26.387 --> 01:37:30.448
Well, then you're all very funny.

01:37:30.525 --> 01:37:33.551
So funny you can get your asses
the hell out of here.

01:37:33.628 --> 01:37:37.564
You think I got time to waste,
Mr. Big Shot Hero?

01:37:37.632 --> 01:37:39.532
You rob Lucky Jim's?

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:40.692
Yes, sir.

01:37:40.768 --> 01:37:42.565
That's interesting.

01:37:42.637 --> 01:37:45.265
'Cause Lucky Jim's
has never been robbed.

01:37:48.476 --> 01:37:50.569
Sure it has.

01:37:50.645 --> 01:37:52.909
I checked all the records.

01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:56.711
And I just got off the phone
with Lucky Jim himself.

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:00.947
Now come on, get out of here.

01:38:01.022 --> 01:38:02.649
Take a walk.

01:38:13.534 --> 01:38:14.728
T.K., you okay?

01:38:15.736 --> 01:38:17.761
Hey.

01:38:17.838 --> 01:38:19.533
Oh, man.

01:38:19.607 --> 01:38:22.132
I can't believe I almost did that.

01:38:24.812 --> 01:38:25.938
I can't believe I did that.

01:38:26.013 --> 01:38:28.982
Don't worry. We get it.

01:38:32.553 --> 01:38:34.521
I'm sorry, guys.

01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:36.318
- Don't worry about it.
- Nah, I'm real sorry.

01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:38.324
It's okay.

01:38:38.392 --> 01:38:41.122
Now I'm fucked up.

01:38:45.399 --> 01:38:47.697
Wow, it's official.
I'm fucked up.

01:38:49.704 --> 01:38:51.331
Did you guys know how fucked up I was?

01:38:53.708 --> 01:38:56.609
Didn't really show... that much.

01:38:56.677 --> 01:39:00.340
I gotta reevaluate.

01:39:00.414 --> 01:39:01.813
You know what?

01:39:01.882 --> 01:39:03.816
I'm starting to see things
more clearly right now.

01:39:03.884 --> 01:39:05.613
Good.

01:39:05.686 --> 01:39:07.745
Great.

01:39:07.822 --> 01:39:09.312
I realize that...

01:39:13.561 --> 01:39:16.257
I don't know shit, man.

01:39:16.330 --> 01:39:18.321
Fuck.

01:39:20.167 --> 01:39:21.691
I don't know shit.

01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:25.538
You know some things.

01:39:25.606 --> 01:39:26.538
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:39:27.608 --> 01:39:29.337
You got the basic skills.

01:39:37.752 --> 01:39:40.448
So how were Randy's parents?

01:39:40.521 --> 01:39:42.216
They were real nice.

01:39:42.290 --> 01:39:43.655
Good, I'm glad.

01:39:43.724 --> 01:39:46.192
And so was Randy's girlfriend
and his baby, too.

01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:47.488
- Oh. God.
- Ouch.

01:39:47.561 --> 01:39:48.653
Yep.

01:39:50.264 --> 01:39:52.960
But look, I got the guitar,

01:39:53.034 --> 01:39:54.865
and, Cheaver, I want you to have it.

01:39:54.935 --> 01:39:57.665
That's real sweet of you,

01:39:57.738 --> 01:40:00.502
but I don't need it.

01:40:01.876 --> 01:40:02.865
I got the money.

01:40:02.943 --> 01:40:04.843
- What?
- How much did you win?

01:40:04.912 --> 01:40:09.349
I didn't win anything.
I didn't even place a bet.

01:40:09.417 --> 01:40:10.543
I reenlisted.

01:40:10.618 --> 01:40:15.085
You what?

01:40:16.624 --> 01:40:18.455
I reenlisted.

01:40:18.526 --> 01:40:20.426
Got a $20,000 signing bonus.

01:40:20.494 --> 01:40:22.758
I'm all set.

01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:24.388
That's insane.

01:40:24.465 --> 01:40:25.898
You're calling me insane?

01:40:25.966 --> 01:40:27.661
Cheaver, I got you the guitar.

01:40:27.735 --> 01:40:29.726
Sell it. Get the money that way.

01:40:29.804 --> 01:40:32.739
You need that guitar
more than I do, Colee.

01:40:32.807 --> 01:40:35.332
No. I got Army money saved up.

01:40:35.409 --> 01:40:37.536
I'm gonna be fine.

01:40:37.611 --> 01:40:39.909
And I'm gonna find my mom
and patch things up,

01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:41.345
so you take it.

01:40:41.415 --> 01:40:43.747
No. I'm going back.

01:40:43.818 --> 01:40:45.285
Recruiter called my home unit.

01:40:45.353 --> 01:40:47.116
They're transferring the paperwork now.

01:40:47.188 --> 01:40:49.679
You can get out of that.

01:40:49.757 --> 01:40:52.089
I don't know that I want to.

01:40:52.159 --> 01:40:54.753
Cheaver, take the guitar.

01:40:54.829 --> 01:40:56.353
Please.

01:40:58.966 --> 01:41:01.059
You take that guitar, Colee.

01:41:02.403 --> 01:41:04.200
It's your guitar.

01:41:04.271 --> 01:41:05.704
Yeah?

01:41:05.773 --> 01:41:08.173
Yeah.

01:41:10.311 --> 01:41:11.369
Thank you.

01:41:11.445 --> 01:41:15.176
No. Thank you.

01:42:01.128 --> 01:42:02.720
Sergeant.

01:42:04.031 --> 01:42:06.431
T.K.

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:07.467
How are ya?

01:42:07.535 --> 01:42:09.901
Good. Good.

01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:11.665
So you got here.

01:42:13.841 --> 01:42:15.934
Excuse me.

01:42:19.613 --> 01:42:21.308
- Look who it is.
- Hey.

01:42:21.382 --> 01:42:23.714
- How are ya?
- Good. How are you doing?

01:42:23.784 --> 01:42:25.752
- How are you doing?
- How are you doing?

01:42:28.088 --> 01:42:29.055
Where's your guitar?

01:42:29.123 --> 01:42:30.522
Did you sell it?

01:42:30.591 --> 01:42:32.286
Sell it?

01:42:32.359 --> 01:42:34.293
Hell, no. I'm learning how to play it.

01:42:34.361 --> 01:42:36.090
- You're learning to play it?
- Yep.

01:42:36.163 --> 01:42:37.653
All right.

01:42:40.334 --> 01:42:42.894
How's your fiancée?

01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:45.404
She's fine.

01:42:45.473 --> 01:42:47.964
But she's not my fiancée anymore.

01:42:53.047 --> 01:42:54.344
Where are you going?

01:42:54.415 --> 01:42:55.643
I'm going to Diyala.

01:42:55.716 --> 01:42:58.150
- Where are you going?
- Anbar.

01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:01.553
Where are you going?

01:43:01.622 --> 01:43:03.112
Tikrit.
