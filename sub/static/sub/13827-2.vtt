a certain goofball around the galaxy,

02:45.374 --> 02:49.086
When I pictured you destroying me,
it wasn't all quick and cheap

02:49.169 --> 02:53.715
in some cramped hallway.
It was special. It was gonna be...

02:56.134 --> 02:59.054
(SCREAMING) This is exactly why I...

03:00.430 --> 03:02.641
Let's... just say,
for the sake of argument,

03:02.724 --> 03:05.686
how would you make your
untimely doom more special?

03:05.769 --> 03:08.438
Well, for starters, location...

03:08.522 --> 03:12.734
When you picture finally getting rid of
us, where do you see it happening?

03:13.360 --> 03:16.238
Wait. Are we doing a, you know, thing?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.532
-Wink.
-Wink.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.492

03:22.035 --> 03:23.954

Uhh... are we really going with the axe?

03:29.626 --> 03:32.212
What's... wrong... with... axes?

03:32.296 --> 03:34.423
Eh! A little old-fashioned, if you ask me.

03:34.506 --> 03:38.093
Oh, yeah. None of the cool villains
are using axes these days.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.470

Nothing! But you wear it every day.

Don't you want to look extra spiffy

13:46.493 --> 13:48.912
No prob. I totally hear you.

13:49.204 --> 13:53.542
(IN LOW VOICE) If my friend wants ten
more minutes, then ten minutes she'll get.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.461
(WHISPERING) I'll just go and rustle up
some grub...

I found the kitchen!
