WEBVTT

00:11.887 --> 00:13.889
- We always think that
the ones who get away

00:14.014 --> 00:15.057
are the lucky ones.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.686
They must have someone
watching over them.

00:19.811 --> 00:20.687
They're blessed.

00:21.813 --> 00:24.775
And we're not supposed
to think like that,

00:24.900 --> 00:26.777
sentimental bullshit,
that's not for us,

00:26.902 --> 00:28.612
jaded bastards, but we do.

00:30.113 --> 00:33.200
And if someone still
clings to life,

00:33.325 --> 00:36.828
a flicker of pulse,
we think lucky,

00:38.997 --> 00:41.625
blessed, watched over.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.881
But what if the killed
are the lucky ones?

00:49.258 --> 00:52.553
(light celesta music)

00:56.098 --> 01:00.936
The brightest, most golden and
most alive, they're chosen.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.232
And the rest of us
aren't lucky at all.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.115
Not blessed.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.035
Not watched over
by some kind angel.

01:19.705 --> 01:22.165
The ones who get left,

01:24.251 --> 01:28.880
they're just too slow, too
stupid, too muddy, too dull.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.349
The gods don't want them.

01:45.314 --> 01:46.231
They're lumps.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.526
They're rejects.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.072
We all are.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.621
(audience applause)

02:04.708 --> 02:05.500
Rejects.

02:09.503 --> 02:11.715
- We won't see each other again.

02:30.442 --> 02:33.862
(haunting string music)

03:16.446 --> 03:19.199
(police sirens)

03:26.164 --> 03:29.668
(muffled dispatch radio)

03:57.529 --> 04:02.701
- Roger Control, we've got
the whole area sealed off.

04:02.909 --> 04:06.037
(distant pop music)

04:07.539 --> 04:11.460
# Under and under and
under and under and under #

04:11.585 --> 04:15.464
# The spell of repetition
really is on you #

04:15.589 --> 04:20.719
# And when you look this
way | really am with you #

04:24.139 --> 04:27.976
# Laid back #

04:28.101 --> 04:31.897
# Laid back #

04:32.022 --> 04:36.234
# Laid back I'll
give you playback #

04:36.359 --> 04:39.821
- [Automated Telephone
Voice] Hang up and try again.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.407
Hang up and try again.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.203
Hang up and try again.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.332
- Eye witness is saying
they saw someone like me.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.627
Isn't really me though, is it?

04:53.752 --> 04:54.419
- | know that, Cian.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.297
But we've got to go through
the motions, tick the boxes.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.799
- | was with Alannah all night.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.759
- What were you doing?

05:02.844 --> 05:04.513
(scoffs)

05:04.638 --> 05:06.807
- Do the English even do that?

05:06.932 --> 05:08.058
Heard all the girls
have to fake it

05:08.183 --> 05:10.185
'cause you're so
shit and repressed.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.186
- It's absolutely true.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.771
-I don't even go
into that shop.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.231
It's a shit hole.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.107
Food in there's
always out of date.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.150
Wouldn't be seen
dead in the kip.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.610
- As you've mentioned
the word dead.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.736
- She speaks.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.321
- Cashier who got stabbed.

05:22.697 --> 05:23.990
Well he is.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.158
Bled out right there.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.327
- Poor fella, I'll
light a candle for him

05:29.120 --> 05:31.873
{ominous music)

05:46.304 --> 05:48.348
- | should be at home.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.100
Should be in bed.

05:50.225 --> 05:53.061
And I'm sat here while
you lot dick around.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.981
| told you what
happened over and over.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.357
- He's saying it was you.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.317
- What?

06:00.610 --> 06:01.403
What was me?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.697
- Your boyfriend, Cian,
he says it was you.

06:05.031 --> 06:05.740
- He wouldn't.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.158
- And you've got a conviction.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.743
Possession of an
offensive weapon;

06:08.910 --> 06:10.120
a serrated kitchen knife.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.913
- That was years ago.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.499
| was 14 for fuck's sake,
didn't do anything with it.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.168
- What's a jury gonna think
when they look at you?

06:18.587 --> 06:20.130
You're what, 23 now?

06:20.255 --> 06:22.549
You've already got two kids
that don't live with you

06:22.674 --> 06:24.634
because of the never ending
car crash of your life,

06:24.759 --> 06:26.177
but despite that you're
having another one

06:26.303 --> 06:27.929
because you think
this time's gonna be

06:28.054 --> 06:29.639
the fairytale with
the happy ending,

06:29.764 --> 06:32.726
and it's not, because a
man's dead in a pool of blood

06:32.851 --> 06:34.019
and you're the one with
the prior conviction

06:34.144 --> 06:37.272
so you'll go to prison, and
Cian will find someone new

06:37.397 --> 06:38.690
because he reckons
he can do better,

06:38.815 --> 06:41.067
and deep down, Alannah,
darling, you agree with him

06:41.192 --> 06:43.570
because you don't think
you're worth anything either.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.822
Why should anyone love you
when you're lower than shit?

06:45.947 --> 06:48.241
So there is no fairytale,
no happy ending,

06:48.366 --> 06:49.242
not for you, not ever.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.412
This only this moment
right here right now

06:52.537 --> 06:55.206
and what you do with it.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.500
- Three, two, one.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.462
{(Alannah sobbing)

07:25.654 --> 07:26.905
Did Cian leave the flat?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.999
Did you get rid of
the knife for him?

07:42.003 --> 07:47.008
- | put it down the grate of
the drain outside my flat.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.302
Put it in a carrier bag.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.596
Still had blood on it.

08:04.359 --> 08:07.278
(seagulls cawing)

08:41.229 --> 08:42.563
- That's yours.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.319
How can you have two
sauces on a bacon sandwich?

08:48.445 --> 08:50.572
- Red sauce one side,
brown on the other.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.282
That's the rules.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.324
- You're a monster.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.831
(chuckles)

08:59.956 --> 09:00.749
Well done.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.251
- You're a ruthless bastard.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.901
(indistinct chatter)

09:43.583 --> 09:45.376
- Detective Garda
Cassandra Maddox.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.838
- [Male] Here he comes.
(applause)

09:48.963 --> 09:49.672
Good work.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.007
Good man yourself.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.175
- [Reilly] Thank you.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.515
- | know that little prick.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.390
That Cian.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.434
He's been a twat
he was in nappies.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.685
Good man yourself though.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.229
- Well it wasn't
just me, was it?

10:04.354 --> 10:06.564
- Been thinking, we
should team up again.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.649
- I've got a partner.

10:07.774 --> 10:08.733
- Yeah but we all
know she's only in

10:08.858 --> 10:10.235
murder because of quotas.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.570
- O'Kelly.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.446
- What?

10:13.571 --> 10:15.615
- All you did was
your job, Reilly.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.450
No call to look smug.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.952
- It's just my face, sir.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.495
- Mm-hmm, where's the other one?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.579
- She's in court this morning,

10:21.704 --> 10:22.956
old case before
she was on murder.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.458
- Iit's not my squad
| don't give a bollocks.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.377
Get off your arse and
go out to the country.

10:27.502 --> 10:28.795
Local Garda have called it in,

10:28.920 --> 10:30.380
forensics already attending.

10:30.505 --> 10:31.256
Piss off.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.590
- I'll come with you.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.217
- What the fuck are these?

10:36.219 --> 10:38.138
You're the sheriff now.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.557
Are you gonna ride into
town and make a giant

10:40.682 --> 10:42.642
tit sandwich out of everything?

10:42.767 --> 10:43.560
- No, sir.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.895
- Then go back to your
desk and do some work,

10:46.020 --> 10:48.356
and | see that t-shirt
again | will staple

10:48.481 --> 10:50.233
your sorry penis to the wall.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.026
Jesus Christ!

10:52.152 --> 10:54.070
Are you trying to
give me an aneurism?

10:57.073 --> 10:59.075
Why haven't you pissed off yet?

10:59.200 --> 11:01.995
- | will when you tell me
where the body is, sir.

11:08.293 --> 11:11.045
{ominous music)

11:21.681 --> 11:22.724
- It was your
evidence that helped

11:22.849 --> 11:24.517
secure Mr. Johnson's conviction,

11:24.642 --> 11:26.686
when you were working as
an undercover officer.

11:26.811 --> 11:27.604
- That's correct.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.231
- Mr. Johnson asserts that
while he accepts his sentence,

11:30.356 --> 11:31.983
it is his inalienable
right to maintain

11:32.108 --> 11:33.693
contact with his
children from prison,

11:33.818 --> 11:35.320
as any other loving father
would be allowed to do.

11:35.445 --> 11:39.157
- What Mr. Johnson wants is
to know where his wife is.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.618
Allowing him any contact
whatsoever with his children

11:41.743 --> 11:44.037
means a clear and immediate
threat to the safety

11:44.162 --> 11:47.207
and wellbeing of both of his
children and their mother.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.499
They must remain hidden.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.462
Mr. Johnson may be in
prison but his associates

11:52.587 --> 11:53.838
will do the work for him.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.716
- [Judge] Any further questions?

11:56.841 --> 11:58.676
- [Barrister] No further
questions, Judge.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.389
(indistinct chatter)

12:16.653 --> 12:18.029
- What have you got?

12:18.154 --> 12:18.947
- 12 year old scrote.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.990
Drove a stolen car into
his mother's front room

12:21.115 --> 12:23.243
because he didn't want
noodles for his tea.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.285
- Fair.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.828
(chuckles)

12:25.954 --> 12:27.789
- Quality dickhead.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.040
- That's me nailed.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.541
(laughing)

12:30.667 --> 12:31.793
See you tonight?

12:31.918 --> 12:33.670
- Can't, got a body.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.527
- How was Johnston?

12:57.652 --> 13:00.071
- Oh you know, he'd
like my head on a spike.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.073
Pretty ordinary really.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.241
Where we going?

13:03.366 --> 13:04.409
- Knocknaree.

13:06.619 --> 13:10.248
| didn't know where
until it was too late.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.474
Your boots are in the back.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.644
- Is it the woods?

13:47.452 --> 13:50.538
(melancholic music)

14:11.184 --> 14:12.310
- Rob Reilly and Cassie Maddox.

14:12.435 --> 14:13.394
- Phelan.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.562
This way, detectives.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.440
Archaeologists.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.900
It's a dig.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.402
Statements and personal
details are being taken.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.905
- [Peter] Come on, Adam.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.615
- [Adam] Peter, Jamie, wait up!

15:10.326 --> 15:11.911
- [Male] Detective.

15:24.882 --> 15:28.052
- Her name was Katherine
Devlin, she's 13.

15:28.177 --> 15:31.222
She was registered as missing
at 2:47 p.m. yesterday,

15:31.347 --> 15:32.432
| ran a check.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.851
The photo of the missing
person sent through.

15:36.894 --> 15:37.728
Sir.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.820
She lives up on the estate.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.574
She lived, up on the estate.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.744
- [Reilly] Have her
family been contacted?

15:53.870 --> 15:54.620
- No, sir.

15:55.746 --> 15:56.622
- We'll do that.

15:57.915 --> 16:01.169
- Has some bastard
been, you know, at her?

16:04.297 --> 16:06.048
- Apart from killing
her you mean?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.677
- Gonna need more
presence on the road.

16:09.802 --> 16:10.845
Make sure no cameras get through

16:10.970 --> 16:12.430
before we've got the tent up.

16:12.555 --> 16:13.723
- [Phelan] Yeah, on it.

16:13.848 --> 16:14.640
- Phelan.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.310
Good job.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.741
(ominous music)

17:03.898 --> 17:06.567
(crow squawks)

17:08.569 --> 17:10.029
- This isn't the kill site.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.656
Egg stage insect activity
and no traces of blood

17:12.781 --> 17:13.907
on the stone or around it,

17:14.032 --> 17:17.161
and she's been dead
approximately 24 to 36 hours,

17:17.286 --> 17:18.746
but don't quote me on that.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.579
- Who found her?

17:19.704 --> 17:22.625
- Two of the archaeologists,
well, | say archaeologists,

17:22.750 --> 17:23.542
they're students.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.127
The lad bent over and
thought she was asleep,

17:25.211 --> 17:26.587
tried to wake her up.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.713
- Has she been raped?

17:27.838 --> 17:28.923
- Can't say at this stage.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.132
Cooper's away at
some conference,

17:30.258 --> 17:31.968
enjoying the sound
of his own voice.

17:32.093 --> 17:32.969
He'll work through
the night on it,

17:33.094 --> 17:34.679
says he'll see you first
thing in the morning.

17:34.804 --> 17:35.805
- And what is this?

17:35.930 --> 17:37.515
- Some sort of altar.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.350
That's why they're
doing the dig.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.894
All this is gonna be
flattened for the motorway.

17:43.604 --> 17:44.939
You know what everyone's
gonna ask about don't you?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.358
It was the first thing Cooper
said when | called him.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.234
- What's that?

17:48.359 --> 17:51.153
- Is this something to do with
the others, back in the 80s?

17:51.279 --> 17:53.155
They were the same sort
of age, weren't they?

17:53.281 --> 17:54.073
12 or 13.

17:56.033 --> 17:56.867
- [Female] Boss.

18:03.958 --> 18:07.503
- [Adam] Peter,
Jamie, wait for me!

18:07.628 --> 18:08.629
Slow down!

18:08.754 --> 18:11.048
- [Peter] No, you speed up!

18:14.677 --> 18:16.012
- Wait for me!

18:17.221 --> 18:19.473
(panting)

18:22.143 --> 18:23.686
Wait up!

18:23.811 --> 18:24.645
Slow down!

18:30.693 --> 18:31.485
Peter!

18:31.611 --> 18:32.778
Jamie!

18:32.903 --> 18:33.654
Where'd you go?

18:41.996 --> 18:42.830
Peter?

18:45.750 --> 18:46.542
Jamie?

18:57.136 --> 18:58.387
Peter?

18:58.512 --> 18:59.221
Jamie?

19:02.558 --> 19:03.893
Where'd you go?

19:12.777 --> 19:14.820
(gasps)

19:17.365 --> 19:19.408
- [Female] Is there any chance
you can give us a statement?

19:19.533 --> 19:21.661
- [Mark] When can we
get on with our work?

19:21.786 --> 19:22.495
- Who are you?

19:22.620 --> 19:24.121
- Mark Hanley, site director.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.373
- [Reilly] Okay Mr. Hanley.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.832
- Dr. Hanley.

19:26.957 --> 19:27.708
- Dr. Hanley.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.794
No one's going to be
doing anything today.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.172
- Who found the body?

19:33.297 --> 19:34.048
- We did.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.591
Mel Royce and Damien Donnelly.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.759
- | lent over her.

19:37.718 --> 19:38.511
I'm sorry.

19:38.636 --> 19:39.845
- [Mel] | told him not to.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.597
It was obvious she
wasn't sleeping.

19:41.722 --> 19:42.765
- Not to me, | didn't know that.

19:42.890 --> 19:43.683
| thought...

19:46.435 --> 19:48.479
Look, I'm sorry for
leaning over her.

19:53.109 --> 19:56.404
- Have you noticed anything
unusual in the site recently?

19:56.529 --> 19:57.738
Anyone suspicious?

19:57.863 --> 19:59.323
- Yeah, yeah loads of them,

19:59.448 --> 20:01.909
all with signs over their
head saying fucking weirdo.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.369
Did you pull this out
of your policeman's hat

20:03.494 --> 20:04.620
of shit questions?

20:04.745 --> 20:05.496
- Mark.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.292
- Thank you for your
time, Dr. Hanley.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.262
- [Radio Reporter]
There continues to be

20:21.387 --> 20:22.722
a strong Garda
presence in the woods

20:22.847 --> 20:24.014
of Knocknaree this morning,

20:24.140 --> 20:25.599
as the search for the
missing school girl

20:25.725 --> 20:27.643
Katherine Devlin intensifies.

20:27.768 --> 20:31.105
The community was rocked back
in 1985 when three children - —

20:31.230 --> 20:33.190
- Right, let's do this.

20:35.526 --> 20:38.654
(melancholic music)

20:51.584 --> 20:53.169
- [Child] Did you find her yet?

20:53.294 --> 20:54.545
Did you find Katy?

20:54.628 --> 20:56.464
- Come here, you.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.299
Keep your mouth shut.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.485
(knocking on door)

21:17.610 --> 21:21.739
(indistinct television chatter)

21:28.829 --> 21:31.123
- Out of the way
Jessica, good girl.

21:31.248 --> 21:31.957
- Mr. Devlin?

21:32.082 --> 21:33.250
- [Jonathan] Yeah.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.044
- I'm Detective
Garda Cassie Maddox,

21:35.169 --> 21:37.421
this is Detective
Sergeant Rob Reilly.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.423
- Have you found Katy?

21:39.548 --> 21:40.966
- Can we come in, Mr. Devlin?

21:42.676 --> 21:45.846
- [Male On TV] | actually
don't like it, because...

21:45.971 --> 21:46.806
- [Jonathan] Rosalind!

21:46.931 --> 21:48.265
- [Female On TV] You
don't like, which?

21:48.390 --> 21:49.725
- [Male On TV] | don't
like prepping the prawns

21:49.850 --> 21:51.393
because | find that the shells,

21:51.519 --> 21:53.854
my hands are kind
of allergic to them.

21:55.731 --> 21:56.565
- Rosalind!

22:09.995 --> 22:10.830
Is she dead?

22:11.872 --> 22:13.666
- The body of a
young girl was found

22:13.791 --> 22:15.084
this morning in the woods.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.879
I'm very sorry to say
but we have good reason

22:19.004 --> 22:20.089
to believe it's Katy.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.550
- But, is she dead?

22:24.593 --> 22:26.095
- I'm afraid she is, yes.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.101
- How is she dead?

22:32.226 --> 22:35.229
- We can't say at this moment.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.564
- Did somebody hurt her?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.149
- [Maddox] I'm afraid so.

22:41.443 --> 22:44.363
- She was such a good girl.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.490
She never gave us
a moment's trouble.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.751
- Are there any family
members we can call?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.712
Anyone who can be with you?

22:59.837 --> 23:01.046
- No.

23:01.171 --> 23:01.964
It's just us.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.093
(Jessica vomiting)

23:06.218 --> 23:07.887
- [Rosalind]
Jessica, sweetheart.

23:08.012 --> 23:08.971
- I'll get a cloth.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.022
- You alerted missing
persons yesterday afternoon,

23:18.105 --> 23:19.064
is that right?

23:19.189 --> 23:22.109
- We all went to bed, | looked
in on her, she was asleep.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.576
- And she wasn't
there in the morning?

23:30.659 --> 23:33.037
- | thought she'd gone training.

23:33.120 --> 23:33.913
She did that.

23:35.539 --> 23:38.417
- Can | take a look at
Katy's bedroom, please?

23:38.542 --> 23:41.587
- It's upstairs, first
door on the right.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.469
- That's very kind of you.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.805
- [Maddox] Not a
problem, Mrs. Devlin.

24:11.033 --> 24:13.953
(music box plays)

24:19.083 --> 24:22.002
(distant chatter)

24:36.100 --> 24:37.518
- | got those for her.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.229
For Jess.

24:41.939 --> 24:42.856
She likes them.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.071
- Is this how Katy left her bed?

24:49.196 --> 24:50.239
- | did that.

24:51.281 --> 24:52.282
| always do that.

24:53.659 --> 24:54.785
So it's ready for her.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.747
- And Jessica didn't
notice or hear anything?

24:58.872 --> 24:59.873
- She was in with me.

25:01.458 --> 25:05.796
She gets, well she gets
night terrors sometimes.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.132
| take her in with me.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.719
Katy needs her sleep.

25:15.472 --> 25:17.391
- And you didn't
hear Katy leave?

25:24.732 --> 25:28.027
- You said Katy went
training most mornings.

25:28.152 --> 25:30.696
- She got into ballet
school in England.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.906
She was going there in
September, in two weeks.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.284
She was training and training.

25:35.409 --> 25:36.660
We thought she was there.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.789
- Is this really happening?

25:40.914 --> 25:42.332
Is this happening?

25:44.251 --> 25:45.794
Is this happening?

25:47.212 --> 25:49.631
(screaming)

25:54.386 --> 25:57.473
(Jessica screaming)

26:13.238 --> 26:14.406
- Katy's dead.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.161
- [Reilly] Jesus Christ.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.412
- Yeah.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.164
Family liaison are here.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.207
I'll go brief them.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.214
- | had them ready.

26:30.339 --> 26:33.217
You pray for good news but
it's never likely is it?

26:33.300 --> 26:35.511
- I'm sure they'll
appreciate the kindness.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.348
- It's Katy.

26:39.473 --> 26:40.224
It's Katy!

26:40.349 --> 26:43.769
- [Female] That's the dance
teacher, Simone Cameron.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.854
Teaches all the little girls.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.314
- You know everyone?

26:47.439 --> 26:48.273
- Everyone and everything.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.609
The curse of being old.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.694
Nothing to say with
Katy that it's like

26:52.820 --> 26:54.655
the other poor children?

26:54.780 --> 26:55.531
- No.

26:55.656 --> 26:56.782
- Well that's something.

26:56.907 --> 26:59.576
My mammy used to say, "Course
they'll never be found,

26:59.701 --> 27:01.328
not hide nor hair.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.331
They've gone under the
hill with the old ones."

27:06.125 --> 27:08.252
- We'll find out
who did it to Katy.

27:11.421 --> 27:12.756
- | always like the English.

27:12.881 --> 27:15.259
There's lots that
don't, but not me.

27:15.384 --> 27:16.885
| always like them.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.179
Mind your feet
there now young man.

27:26.019 --> 27:26.854
- Rob?

27:31.859 --> 27:33.277
We need to stop off
somewhere quiet.

27:33.402 --> 27:34.319
- No we haven't got time.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.363
- Somewhere quiet,
it won't take long.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.048
This isn't for us.

27:56.633 --> 27:57.885
We can't do this.

27:58.802 --> 27:59.636
Not this one.

28:00.971 --> 28:04.057
- You know what O'Kelly does
to people who pass on cases?

28:04.183 --> 28:05.809
You've seen how
he treats Quigley.

28:05.893 --> 28:06.894
-I don't care.

28:07.019 --> 28:07.978
We're passing on it.

28:09.479 --> 28:10.314
- How?

28:11.231 --> 28:14.401
- We tell him my head is
wrecked from working dead kids.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.319
You back me up.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.364
I'm drinking too much,
my concentration's shot,

28:19.489 --> 28:21.116
I'm not sleeping.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.619
My head is fucked from
all the raped dead kids.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.704
- That's not true, Cass.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.497
- You think | can't
play psych reports?

28:27.623 --> 28:29.583
- So we go back
and bail on it now?

28:29.708 --> 28:31.126
- Not right now.

28:31.251 --> 28:32.878
We do the prep, set it up.

28:34.463 --> 28:37.507
Gives you time to have concerns
over my erratic behaviour.

28:37.633 --> 28:40.052
Concerns you take
discreetly to O'Kelly.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.471
We set everything up,
take the family through

28:42.596 --> 28:45.182
the formal identification,
but then we're out.

28:47.059 --> 28:50.479
Say yes, Rob, because we
absolutely cannot do this one.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.732
And you know why
you can't do it.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.195
(sighs)

28:58.320 --> 28:59.071
- Yes.

29:04.284 --> 29:05.118
- Are we okay?

29:08.163 --> 29:09.957
- We're always okay, Cass.

29:10.666 --> 29:11.458
Always.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.926
(light classical music)

29:33.689 --> 29:35.774
- [Radio Reporter] Residents
of the Knocknaree estate

29:35.899 --> 29:38.277
are only too familiar
with grief and heartache,

29:38.402 --> 29:40.904
as 21 years ago,
again in August,

29:41.029 --> 29:43.365
three children disappeared
from the woods,

29:43.490 --> 29:45.325
and only one was ever found.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.245
Nobody in Knocknaree who
remembers that terrible summer

29:48.370 --> 29:51.540
will ever forget the names
Peter, Germaine and Adam.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.251
And now there is another
name to add to that list,

29:54.334 --> 29:55.544
that of K-

29:55.669 --> 29:57.087
- [Anne Robinson] What
G is the general name --

29:57.212 --> 29:58.422
- We're missing our
favourite programme.

29:58.505 --> 29:59.423
- [Anne Robinson] To accompany
meat and often served

29:59.548 --> 30:01.591
in a long, shallow
jug known as a boat?

30:01.717 --> 30:02.467
- [Contestant] Gravy.

30:02.592 --> 30:03.343
- [Anne Robinson] Correct.

30:03.468 --> 30:06.513
(construction noise)

30:07.681 --> 30:10.434
(ominous music)

30:19.776 --> 30:22.070
- Cathal, it's happened again.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.409
- [Cathal] Yeah?

30:27.534 --> 30:29.119
What's happened again?

30:29.244 --> 30:30.704
- Knocknaree.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.122
- Fucking Christ.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.541
Keep your voice down,
you fucking animal.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.046
Here.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.591
Buy a toothbrush, buy some
wet wipes and fuck off.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.302
- Cathal.

30:48.930 --> 30:49.765
Our evil.

30:52.142 --> 30:54.561
Ours, you, me and Janet,
and the three of us,

30:54.686 --> 30:57.105
there's no escape,
we can't escape.

30:57.230 --> 30:59.983
- Come back again and
I'll have you kneecapped.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.088
- Is it paedos?

31:21.213 --> 31:23.632
- There's no immediate
sign of sexual assault.

31:23.757 --> 31:24.966
Cooper's doing the PM overnight,

31:25.092 --> 31:27.010
he'll be ready for us at 5 a.m..

31:27.135 --> 31:28.387
- Jesus, that fella.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.472
Sometimes he wouldn't give
you the steam off his piss,

31:30.597 --> 31:32.766
other times he gives
you the full bladder.

31:32.891 --> 31:33.642
Family?

31:33.767 --> 31:35.852
- Door to door says they keep
themselves to themselves.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.938
Not drinkers, not
ones to give a party.

31:38.063 --> 31:40.565
Mrs. Devlin looks like she's
on prescription trangs.

31:40.690 --> 31:41.775
Jessica, the twin daughter,

31:41.900 --> 31:44.194
has some sort of
learning difficulty.

31:44.319 --> 31:47.489
Jonathan Devlin leads the
campaign to move the motorway.

31:47.614 --> 31:50.117
The estate thought a
lot of Katy though.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.410
One of their own doing well.

31:51.535 --> 31:54.287
- Yeah well I'm getting
bollocks off the bloody press,

31:54.413 --> 31:56.790
wanking themselves into
a frenzy about the dig

31:56.915 --> 31:59.876
and this ancient site and
is it a satanic ritual?

32:00.001 --> 32:00.836
Fuck sake.

32:00.961 --> 32:02.838
Oh and is it a serial
killer who takes

32:02.963 --> 32:05.674
21 years off in between crimes?

32:05.799 --> 32:07.050
| hate journalists.

32:07.175 --> 32:09.428
I'd quite happily set
the dogs on all of them.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.138
- We have a body and
there were no bodies

32:11.263 --> 32:12.347
recovered back then.

32:12.472 --> 32:17.227
- Three kids go into those
woods, only one comes out alive.

32:17.352 --> 32:20.730
You two, get across that
Peter, Germaine and Adam case.

32:20.856 --> 32:23.316
Get down to the archives
and pull all the files.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.653
See if there's anything
we missed last time round.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.530
Any detail, any connection.

32:28.655 --> 32:31.658
| don't care how
tiny or random it is.

32:31.783 --> 32:32.742
Hound it down.

32:32.868 --> 32:33.785
- [Reilly] We will,

32:35.078 --> 32:37.038
- What is wrong with you Maddox?

32:37.164 --> 32:39.291
If | had wanted
female detectives

32:39.416 --> 32:40.709
to stand around and look pretty

32:40.834 --> 32:42.627
I'd have got ones
with bigger tits.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.546
- You don't get to
speak to me like that.

32:46.256 --> 32:47.966
And it's Jamie.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.468
- [O'Kelly] What's Jamie?

32:49.593 --> 32:50.302
- Germaine.

32:50.427 --> 32:51.595
That's what she got called.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.597
That's what she
liked to be called.

32:53.722 --> 32:54.556
So if you're gonna
talk about her

32:54.681 --> 32:57.017
have the decency to use
the name she preferred.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.398
(door slams)

33:03.523 --> 33:04.316
- Jesus.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.944
Well usually | get
some smart-ass comment

33:08.069 --> 33:10.322
about sure no one could
have bigger tits than me.

33:10.447 --> 33:12.240
- She hasn't been sleeping well.

33:12.365 --> 33:15.076
Drinking a bit too
much if you ask me.

33:15.202 --> 33:16.369
Dead kids, you know?

33:19.206 --> 33:20.040
Yes, sir.

33:22.042 --> 33:22.876
- Reilly.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.379
She isn't gonna
complain to HR about me,

33:26.505 --> 33:29.090
'cause it was just craic,
everyone knows that.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.383
- I'll talk to her, sir.

33:37.390 --> 33:40.101
(ominous music)

33:53.782 --> 33:54.574
What's that?

33:54.699 --> 33:56.076
- From the ballet teacher.

33:57.494 --> 33:59.120
- Simone Cameron.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.206
- From Katy's
farewell performance.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.461
So, O'Kelly?

34:06.586 --> 34:09.547
- He doesn't give a shit
about your erratic behaviour.

34:09.672 --> 34:12.175
He's just scared
you'll complain to HR.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.469
- | like when he's scared.

34:15.971 --> 34:18.639
(ballet music)

34:27.649 --> 34:28.525
We agreed.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.362
It's the right thing.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.322
- | didn't say a word.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.792
(ominous music)

35:33.506 --> 35:34.924
- [Male] Peter!

35:35.050 --> 35:35.842
Jamie!

35:35.967 --> 35:37.385
Jamie!

35:37.510 --> 35:38.386
Adam!

35:38.511 --> 35:41.014
(dogs barking)

35:41.139 --> 35:41.931
Adam!

35:43.516 --> 35:44.351
Jamie!

35:59.658 --> 36:00.492
Adam!

36:01.826 --> 36:03.036
Peter!

36:03.161 --> 36:03.995
Peter!

36:04.120 --> 36:06.122
(dog barking)

36:06.247 --> 36:08.458
- [Male] Sarge, over here!

38:02.822 --> 38:04.574
- His feet aren't cut.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.242
It's not his blood.

38:13.333 --> 38:15.668
No cuts on his back either.

38:45.657 --> 38:48.576
(inhaling deeply)

40:34.724 --> 40:37.268
(door creeks)

41:35.410 --> 41:37.996
(eerie music)

41:53.428 --> 41:55.555
(growls)

42:38.056 --> 42:40.808
(barking)

42:40.933 --> 42:43.227
(groaning)

43:27.188 --> 43:30.108
(heavy breathing)

43:49.085 --> 43:50.545
- [Reilly] Oh, Jesus Heather.

43:51.462 --> 43:52.755
- You woke me up.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.715
You know I'm a light sleeper.

43:54.841 --> 43:55.675
- [Reilly] Sorry.

43:57.385 --> 43:59.762
Something you want, Heather?

43:59.887 --> 44:01.264
- There is, actually.

44:01.389 --> 44:02.723
Could you not
smoke in your room?

44:02.849 --> 44:04.350
It really aggravates my asthma.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.393
- [Reilly] You have asthma?

44:05.518 --> 44:06.269
Oh no.

44:06.394 --> 44:07.395
- Yeah.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.229
- [Reilly] You
never told me that.

44:08.354 --> 44:09.438
Have you got a puffer?

44:10.606 --> 44:11.566
- No.

44:11.691 --> 44:12.441
- Shit, Heather.

44:12.567 --> 44:14.777
You should have a puffer
if you're asthmatic.

44:14.902 --> 44:16.070
This is dangerous.

44:16.195 --> 44:16.946
You could die.

44:17.071 --> 44:18.197
We should get you to
a hospital right now,

44:18.322 --> 44:20.116
grab your jacket
and I'll drive you.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.911
- Could you just not
smoke in your room?

44:24.036 --> 44:25.288
- Yeah, sure.

44:25.413 --> 44:26.873
- And that is mine.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.374
See?

44:28.499 --> 44:29.417
The H.

44:31.502 --> 44:32.503
- Oh yeah.

44:32.628 --> 44:34.547
Thought it was an R.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.174
It's a bit like how you
thought you had asthma

44:36.299 --> 44:37.466
but it was just a
bit of a tickly cough

44:37.592 --> 44:40.261
and a good suck on a lozenge
will sort you right out.

44:50.897 --> 44:52.440
- The cheese you had
in there went green,

44:52.565 --> 44:54.275
50, chucked it out.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.945
It's your turn to buy
bleach and loo roll.

44:58.070 --> 44:58.779
- Okay.

45:05.661 --> 45:07.830
- And those are my peas, too.

45:31.938 --> 45:34.899
(heavy breathing)

45:36.859 --> 45:39.862
(car horn honking)

45:53.167 --> 45:54.335
(car horn honking)

45:54.418 --> 45:57.380
- [Female] Get out
the fucking way!

46:10.142 --> 46:11.727
- [Reilly] Sorry to
wake you up, Cass.

46:11.852 --> 46:14.605
- | think the moral of
the story for you here

46:14.730 --> 46:17.775
is don't screw your landlady.

46:17.900 --> 46:20.653
- | didn't think she'd
take it out on the cheddar.

46:20.778 --> 46:24.031
- Be thankful that's all
she's taking it out on.

46:27.576 --> 46:30.371
Let's not pretend it's
been a normal day.

46:30.496 --> 46:31.330
- Yeah all right.

46:42.633 --> 46:43.634
- Rosalind Devlin.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.178
- What about her?

46:47.471 --> 46:48.848
- She wasn't wearing a bra.

46:50.933 --> 46:52.727
What, you didn't notice?

46:52.852 --> 46:54.353
- Did | notice that
the teenager sister of

46:54.478 --> 46:56.063
a murdered kid
wasn't wearing a bra?

46:56.188 --> 46:58.441
How fucking dark
do you think | am?

46:58.566 --> 47:02.069
- Well, | did,
I'm am that fucking dark.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.612
She wasn't wearing a bra.

47:05.156 --> 47:06.615
And those clothes.

47:08.534 --> 47:09.702
Those fucking clothes.

47:11.537 --> 47:12.830
- What are you thinking?

47:17.752 --> 47:20.546
Are you changing your
mind about passing on it?

47:39.607 --> 47:42.443
(distant sirens)

47:50.409 --> 47:51.869
- O'Kelly wanted me to come.

47:51.994 --> 47:53.788
Report straight back to
him if it's, you know.

47:53.913 --> 47:55.956
- Fuckin' paedos.

47:56.082 --> 47:58.000
Nice that he let you
out of the building.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.668
- He wants Cooper to
tell him | puked up

47:59.794 --> 48:01.253
so he can laugh at me.

48:01.379 --> 48:02.296
He's a bastard.

48:02.421 --> 48:04.632
- Just breathe through
your mouth quickly.

48:17.770 --> 48:20.147
- So, stomach contents.

48:20.272 --> 48:22.483
A meal consisting
of beans on toast.

48:23.442 --> 48:25.403
Classic dish, | enjoy it myself.

48:26.362 --> 48:27.655
Advanced digestive process,

48:27.780 --> 48:30.116
so eaten a good five
hours before death.

48:30.241 --> 48:34.537
And a chocolate biscuit,
initial digestive process.

48:34.620 --> 48:36.705
- So her killer could've
given it to her then?

48:36.831 --> 48:38.332
- Or she could've taken
it from her house,

48:38.457 --> 48:40.042
a snack for the walk.

48:40.167 --> 48:41.460
Even | have a biscuit tin.

48:43.379 --> 48:47.383
So, two blows with an object
of considerable weight.

48:47.508 --> 48:49.468
The first grazes the
right hand side of

48:49.593 --> 48:52.471
the back of her skull,
second blow is more forceful,

48:52.596 --> 48:56.225
landing just behind
and above the left ear.

48:56.350 --> 48:59.311
A lot of blood, though
neither blow were enough to...

49:00.604 --> 49:02.857
Are you going to vomit,
Detective Quigley?

49:06.819 --> 49:09.363
- All right, so what
did kill her then?

49:10.531 --> 49:11.907
- This is what killed her.

49:14.785 --> 49:16.787
Some material,
probably a plastic bag,

49:16.912 --> 49:19.290
was placed over her head,
twisted the top of the spine

49:19.415 --> 49:21.125
and held it in place.

49:21.250 --> 49:22.543
Particular haemorrhage
to the eyes

49:22.668 --> 49:24.044
and surface of the
lungs means that | can

49:24.170 --> 49:25.921
comfortably assert
that the cause of death

49:26.046 --> 49:29.300
was suffocation, complicated
by blunt force trauma.

49:30.217 --> 49:32.052
Though there is a
time lapse between

49:32.136 --> 49:34.263
the trauma to the head
and the suffocation,

49:34.388 --> 49:35.473
perhaps about an
hour and a half,

49:35.598 --> 49:39.059
during which time she was
undoubtedly still living.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.687
- Did she know it was happening?

49:41.812 --> 49:43.814
- Abrasions to the
knees, hip, elbows

49:43.939 --> 49:45.524
are consistent with struggle.

49:45.649 --> 49:47.276
There's also bruising
and tooth marks

49:47.401 --> 49:48.319
on the inside of her mouth,

49:48.444 --> 49:50.154
consistent with the
perpetrator pressing

49:50.279 --> 49:51.489
a hand over her mouth.

49:53.407 --> 49:55.993
No secondary lividity, so
the position she was found in

49:56.118 --> 49:57.912
was the position
she was kept in.

49:58.037 --> 49:59.997
Time of death | would
say between midnight

50:00.122 --> 50:03.209
and 2 a.m. on the
24th of August 20086,

50:03.334 --> 50:04.835
meaning that she was
kept somewhere sheltered

50:04.960 --> 50:07.129
before being carried into
the woods to be discovered

50:07.254 --> 50:12.092
at 7:45 a.m. on the
25th of August 2006.

50:14.094 --> 50:15.888
- She wasn't raped?

50:16.013 --> 50:17.306
No sign of any violation?

50:17.431 --> 50:18.098
- No.

50:18.224 --> 50:20.643
The child in that respect
at least is untouched.

50:21.936 --> 50:23.687
She'll be ready for
formal identification

50:23.812 --> 50:24.855
later this morning.

50:26.815 --> 50:27.858
- I'll ring O'Kelly.

50:35.574 --> 50:36.951
- Oh sweetheart.

50:38.077 --> 50:39.537
Your little feet.

50:43.457 --> 50:46.210
(ominous music)

51:08.857 --> 51:10.985
(phone ringing)

51:11.110 --> 51:12.528
- [Maddox] Hi, this
is Cassandra Maddox.

51:12.653 --> 51:13.946
Please leave me a message.

51:14.071 --> 51:14.863
(beep)

51:14.989 --> 51:15.990
- [Male] Hey, it's me.

51:16.115 --> 51:17.908
| was hoping to catch you
before you went to Cooper.

51:18.033 --> 51:20.744
I'm guessing you got
your phone turned off.

51:20.869 --> 51:22.413
Just checking you're okay.

51:22.538 --> 51:23.289
See you later.

52:00.284 --> 52:02.953
- I'll get a shower and
a change of clothes.

52:03.078 --> 52:05.331
Have to wash the smell
of that place off me.

52:08.709 --> 52:10.336
Get flowers.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.463
Make sure you get her flowers.

52:12.588 --> 52:14.590
And give her a hug, Rob.

52:36.195 --> 52:39.615
(indistinct TV chatter)

52:58.550 --> 53:01.887
(indistinct pop music)

53:30.833 --> 53:33.585
(ominous music)

54:19.256 --> 54:22.426
(melancholic music)

55:01.173 --> 55:02.174
- Hello Mum.

55:03.175 --> 55:04.092
- Hello Adam.

55:05.344 --> 55:07.554
- You need to be
careful calling me that.

55:27.574 --> 55:28.408
- Adam?

55:30.786 --> 55:31.578
Adam?

55:33.747 --> 55:36.583
Where are Peter and Jamie?

55:36.708 --> 55:39.127
Their mammies and
daddy are desperate.

55:41.213 --> 55:42.506
Where are they?

55:43.799 --> 55:45.008
What happened?

55:46.552 --> 55:49.221
(panicked breathing)

55:49.346 --> 55:50.347
- Adam!

55:50.472 --> 55:51.765
Adam where are they?

55:51.890 --> 55:52.850
- [Father] Leave him alone!

55:52.975 --> 55:53.934
- Where's my Jamie?

55:54.059 --> 55:54.852
- Just go away!

55:54.977 --> 55:56.103
- What happened Adam?

55:56.228 --> 55:57.396
I'll never leave!

55:57.521 --> 55:58.772
- [Father] Leave him alone!

55:58.897 --> 55:59.857
- Just tell us, where are they?

55:59.982 --> 56:01.441
- He doesn't know!

56:03.110 --> 56:04.278
- [Female] Adam!

56:04.403 --> 56:05.195
Please!

56:11.702 --> 56:14.913
(indistinct chatter)

56:27.301 --> 56:29.595
- You're a good boy, Adam.

56:38.770 --> 56:40.522
- | know this is a big change,

56:40.647 --> 56:43.984
but we're gonna make a
success of it, aren't we Adam?

56:44.109 --> 56:45.360
- My middle name's Robert.

56:46.320 --> 56:48.196
| want to be Robert now.

57:24.858 --> 57:28.236
(haunting theme music)
