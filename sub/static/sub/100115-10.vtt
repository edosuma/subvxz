00:00.917 --> 00:04.963
                 Spirit Week
had arrived
at Riverdale High.

00:05.004 --> 00:05.796
      And for the first time
in years,

00:05.796 --> 00:09.384
       the students actually
had something to celebrate.

00:09.426 --> 00:13.679
   The long-suffering Bulldogs,
in large part thanks to
breakout star Munroe Moore,

00:13.721 --> 00:16.390
        were finally going
to the state finals,

00:16.432 --> 00:20.019
     where they would take on
the undisputed titans
of the gridiron,

00:20.060 --> 00:22.105
     the Stonewall Stallions.

00:22.146 --> 00:24.606
        For Principal Honey,
who commissioned
an article about the game

00:24.649 --> 00:26.359
         from ace reporter
Betty Cooper,

00:26.400 --> 00:30.655
 the championship was, at last,
something positive to promote.

00:30.696 --> 00:34.826
   But for Riverdale's star QB,
Archie Andrews,

00:34.868 --> 00:38.329
   this Spirit Week was special
for a different reason.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.081
            It would be
the last of his career.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.584
              Jones,

00:42.625 --> 00:44.252
         how long have you
had that machine?

00:44.918 --> 00:47.881
     Feels like forever. Why?

00:47.921 --> 00:50.258
       Think it's about time
for an upgrade?

00:50.299 --> 00:53.011
         No. Keys are used
to my fingertips.

00:53.052 --> 00:54.887
       Plus, I'm sentimental
and superstitious.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.430
         -[Bret chuckles]
-[computer chimes]

00:57.182 --> 00:59.725
       Oh, crap. I gotta go.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.936
      Mr. DuPont summoned me
for some reason.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.903
           How did I get
an interview with Yale?

01:09.944 --> 01:10.528
       I didn't even apply.

01:10.528 --> 01:14.073
      Yes, but the recruiter
is a friend of mine,

01:14.114 --> 01:16.075
         so I slipped him
a few of your short stories,

01:16.117 --> 01:17.493
    and he was quite impressed.

01:17.534 --> 01:20.412
    I assume you're interested?

01:20.454 --> 01:23.415
      Yale is my girlfriend's
dream school,
and she didn't get in, so...

01:23.457 --> 01:27.253
    Yes, well, the heart can be
a difficult minefield
to navigate,

01:27.295 --> 01:28.962
        but take my advice.

01:29.004 --> 01:32.549
           Figure it out.
Don't be foolish.

01:32.591 --> 01:34.760
               Mmm, gotta go
with number three.

01:34.802 --> 01:36.679
      It's damn good, Ronnie.

01:36.721 --> 01:40.307
      It's my special shimmy
recipe.

01:40.349 --> 01:43.144
         I thought your dad
patented the recipe,
so you couldn't use it.

01:43.186 --> 01:47.022
          Daddy may have
patented our family recipe
for his own profit,

01:47.064 --> 01:52.277
            but this is
a modified spiced rum
with a unique flavor profile.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.033
    Now it's time to introduce
Luna Rum to the outside world.

01:59.409 --> 02:00.787
       [school bell ringing]

02:03.581 --> 02:07.835
  Cheryl, girls, how fortuitous.

02:07.876 --> 02:08.919
  I'd like you to meet someone--

02:08.961 --> 02:09.753
     [Cheryl] No time to chat,
Mr. Honey.

02:09.795 --> 02:12.549
          We're on our way
to practice our Spirit Week
musical routine,

02:12.590 --> 02:14.300
  which will, naturally, be epic.

02:14.925 --> 02:16.844
         On that subject,

02:16.885 --> 02:19.472
          as was discussed
with Mrs. Burble,

02:19.514 --> 02:22.432
         I have brought in
Miss Appleyard to be your...

02:22.850 --> 02:23.393
            new coach.

02:23.433 --> 02:25.937
         But cheer season
is almost done, Mr. Honey.

02:27.271 --> 02:28.730
    I can handle this, Holden.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.317
               Mmm.

02:34.278 --> 02:37.365
        Look, I'm not sure
what Honey has told you,
but we don't need a coach.

02:37.406 --> 02:39.199
    I run the show around here.

02:39.241 --> 02:42.162
      Howevs, we are looking
for a launderwoman.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.413
            From now on,
we're gonna change things up.

02:44.454 --> 02:46.665
   The Vixens are a cheer squad.

02:46.707 --> 02:48.418
  So we'll be focusing on cheers,

02:48.459 --> 02:51.378
      not singing and dancing
to pop songs.

02:51.420 --> 02:54.257
       Now, gather the rest
of the girls and meet me
out on the field,

02:54.299 --> 02:57.050
        so we can practice
some drills, okay?

02:57.093 --> 03:00.889
  I'm sorry, am I hallucinating,
or did you just
give me an order?

03:00.930 --> 03:04.516
  I led my last team to nationals
three years in a row.

03:04.558 --> 03:06.060
          I think I know
what I'm doing here.

03:09.771 --> 03:12.192
     -[speaking indistinctly]
-[chuckling]

03:12.233 --> 03:14.860
        Okay, so last game
of the season.

03:14.902 --> 03:17.112
         -[Archie exhales]
-[Betty] How do you feel, Arch?

03:17.155 --> 03:19.449
  Honestly, like we're gonna win.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.616
             Mmm-hmm.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.201
      Munroe, what about you?

03:22.242 --> 03:24.078
           I'm just happy
to be playing
for the championship.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.872
              -Whoo!
-He's being humble, Betty.

03:25.913 --> 03:28.707
    A recruiter from Notre Dame
is coming just to see him.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.126
     Reggie, care to comment?

03:30.168 --> 03:31.669
     You want a quote, Betts?

03:31.711 --> 03:32.711
           [Betty] Sure.

03:32.753 --> 03:34.546
      I'll give you a quote.

03:34.588 --> 03:36.966
         -Stonewall sucks.
-[Munroe] Hmm.

03:37.008 --> 03:40.929
          The only reason
why they're undefeated
is because they play dirty.

03:40.969 --> 03:42.847
          Dirty. Mmm-hmm.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.848
     Every team that's gone up
against them this year

03:44.890 --> 03:46.643
            has suffered
some horrible injury.

03:46.683 --> 03:47.143
         What do you mean?

03:47.185 --> 03:50.062
              I mean,
they don't play to win.

03:50.604 --> 03:51.772
        They play to hurt.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.901
              But...

03:54.942 --> 03:56.485
       they haven't gone up
against our guy.

03:57.736 --> 03:58.780
              Munroe.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.908
          So, you excited
for the big game?

04:02.950 --> 04:05.745
        -Everyone's pumped.
-I can't wait to see you play.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.122
    If your arm's half as good
as your dad's was,

04:08.163 --> 04:09.373
           I bet you got
a hell of a throw.

04:10.875 --> 04:11.751
         Hey, Uncle Frank.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.753
       -I've been thinking--
-Mmm-hmm.

04:14.795 --> 04:16.129
           Yeah, me too.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.089
              Look...

04:17.089 --> 04:21.343
      I really appreciate you
putting me up here for
the last couple of weeks,

04:21.386 --> 04:23.178
       getting to meet you,
getting to know you.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.848
    You're a great kid, Archie.

04:26.557 --> 04:27.725
     Your dad raised you well.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.144
            But, uh...

04:31.144 --> 04:32.855
   I think it's time I moved on.

04:32.896 --> 04:33.981
      I've paid my respects.

04:34.023 --> 04:35.441
    I was actually wondering...

04:36.149 --> 04:37.026
     what if you didn't leave?

04:37.901 --> 04:39.278
     You could help out here.

04:39.319 --> 04:39.946
     Or Andrews Construction.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.784
       [sighs] I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't interested.

04:45.826 --> 04:46.411
            Problem is,
that means telling--

04:46.411 --> 04:49.454
          -Telling my mom
you're in town.
-Yeah.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.915
    Like I've said, there's not
a lot of love lost there.

04:51.957 --> 04:55.043
      Well, whatever happened
between you guys in the past,
I'm sure you can work it out.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.963
       Hell, she'll probably
be happy to see you.

05:01.341 --> 05:02.884
   [Mary] Let me ask you, Frank.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.928
       Have you even visited
your brother's grave?

05:04.971 --> 05:06.848
         You didn't bother
to show up for the funeral.

05:06.889 --> 05:10.350
    I was on a crab boat, Mary.
I didn't get the news
till a month ago.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.144
       Mom, I was thinking,

05:12.185 --> 05:14.771
    maybe Uncle Frank could get
a job at Andrews Construction?

05:14.814 --> 05:16.231
    You asked my son for a job?

05:16.274 --> 05:18.358
             No, Mom,
the job was my idea.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.403
        [sighs] Okay, fine.

05:20.444 --> 05:21.194
    But mark my words, Archie,

05:21.237 --> 05:25.158
  the second your uncle has to do
even an ounce of hard work,

05:25.199 --> 05:27.744
       he will bolt so fast
your head will spin.

05:33.707 --> 05:35.877
       [soft music playing]

05:37.252 --> 05:38.963
               Jug?

05:39.004 --> 05:41.841
        You've been dipping
that fry in ketchup
for five minutes.

05:41.882 --> 05:43.759
         -What's going on?
-[sighs]

05:45.093 --> 05:47.305
        I have an interview
with a college recruiter.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.221
             For Yale.

05:51.893 --> 05:52.518
        I hope that's okay.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.730
     Yeah, why wouldn't it be?
Because I got rejected?

05:55.771 --> 05:56.939
              Well...

05:56.980 --> 05:59.608
          Yeah, kind of.

05:59.649 --> 06:03.403
    Well, I would never ask you
to turn down
an opportunity like that.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.572
       That's life-changing.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.451
   So you're obviously gonna go
and ace that interview.

06:10.577 --> 06:13.706
    Meanwhile, I'll be working
on my article for Mr. Honey.

06:13.747 --> 06:14.706
      Yeah, how's that going?

06:15.415 --> 06:17.418
        It's a puff piece.

06:17.459 --> 06:19.879
       Have you thought about
interviewing the opposing team?

06:19.920 --> 06:20.754
  You know, Bret's team captain.

06:20.797 --> 06:26.009
      Yeah, I know. He's also
the guy who attacked us
in a bunny mask.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.928
         You really want me
to interview that jerk?

06:27.970 --> 06:29.471
        It could mean drama
for your piece.

06:33.475 --> 06:34.810
  What can I do for you, Cheryl?

06:34.851 --> 06:37.939
      We got off on the wrong
Repetto-covered foot.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.774
     I'd like us to find a way
to work together
in blissful harmony.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.860
      Cheryl, I'm the coach.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.404
        You're the athlete.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.865
        The power structure
couldn't be clearer.

06:47.906 --> 06:49.617
       As for your muffins,

06:49.658 --> 06:52.120
          could I suggest
a little less time baking,

06:52.161 --> 06:55.081
      and a little more time
in the weight room?

06:55.122 --> 06:57.959
      My body is perfection,
you crone!

06:58.000 --> 07:01.379
     And you may be the coach,
but I think you'll find
the Vixens are mine,

07:01.420 --> 07:02.422
           forevermore.

07:09.553 --> 07:13.307
      Full disclosure, Bret,
I wasn't going to
interview you.

07:13.348 --> 07:15.935
      But then I heard rumors
that your team plays dirty.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.021
     "They don't play to win.

07:19.980 --> 07:21.690
        They play to hurt."

07:24.067 --> 07:25.153
             Betty...

07:27.321 --> 07:29.906
       have you ever really
watched or studied football?

07:31.492 --> 07:34.286
        'Cause, sweetheart,
it's not a knitting circle.

07:34.327 --> 07:36.204
       It's social Darwinism
in uniforms.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.168
            Football is

07:40.877 --> 07:43.004
      a sport of gladiators,

07:43.045 --> 07:46.841
    and you win by debilitating
and slaughtering your enemies.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.136
               Mmm.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.598
    Gosh, I have to go, but...

07:55.057 --> 07:56.475
     you can quote me on that.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.232
         You bet your ass
I will, psycho.

08:11.156 --> 08:12.033
             [Veronica]
As restaurant owners,

08:12.033 --> 08:17.663
      you know the importance
of quality in every dish
and glass you serve.

08:17.704 --> 08:20.957
            Luna Rum is
a small-batch operation,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.504
         focused on making
each bottle special.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.755
          The name "Luna"
abuelita

08:26.797 --> 08:30.843
          and generations
of rum-making women
in my family.

08:30.884 --> 08:33.513
  Interesting. Is that cardamom?

08:33.553 --> 08:36.765
        Among other things.
It's my own special blend.

08:36.807 --> 08:39.184
         Luna is all about
valuing tradition,

08:39.226 --> 08:42.270
       while adding a touch
sabor.

08:42.312 --> 08:45.024
         I'll take a case.
This is special.

08:45.774 --> 08:47.109
            Wonderful.

08:47.150 --> 08:49.236
           Your customers
will not be disappointed.

09:07.296 --> 09:07.797
              [gasps]

09:11.384 --> 09:13.927
           A good writer
needs the best tools.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.888
       Did you get me this?

09:15.929 --> 09:18.265
        It's a welcome gift
from the Quill and Skull.

09:18.307 --> 09:18.975
        Speaking of which,

09:19.015 --> 09:21.726
      meet us in the basement
tonight, ten o'clock sharp.

09:21.769 --> 09:22.644
          Dare I ask why?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.105
            You'll see.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.946
    How can I help you, Cheryl?

09:33.280 --> 09:35.115
      We're going on strike.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.408
   During Spirit Week, no less.

09:38.451 --> 09:40.580
  -You must fire Miss Appleyard.
-[scoffs]

09:40.620 --> 09:41.163
      She's a rotten scourge

09:41.163 --> 09:43.874
         who has afflicted
our divine sisterhood.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.629
     I'd hate for there to be
a big, Vixen-shaped hole

09:48.671 --> 09:51.090
     during the most important
football game of the year.

09:51.631 --> 09:53.509
         Nay, the century.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.595
            [chuckles]

09:57.138 --> 10:00.390
          I usually don't
respond well to threats.

10:03.101 --> 10:04.687
         But in this case,

10:04.729 --> 10:06.230
         I'll consider it.

10:07.731 --> 10:08.816
        [starts recording]

10:08.857 --> 10:10.109
  Thank you for meeting with me.

10:10.150 --> 10:10.817
     Like I said on the phone,

10:10.817 --> 10:13.195
        I'm writing a story
about the Stonewall Stallions,

10:13.236 --> 10:17.115
          about the rumors
that they play dirty.

10:17.158 --> 10:17.908
   I've been studying game tape,

10:17.950 --> 10:21.953
  and there's a definite pattern
of violence, wanton violence.

10:21.995 --> 10:23.956
       Those Stonewall guys
are maniacs.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.582
         Maniacs? How so?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.500
        A Stonewall lineman
broke my arm

10:27.543 --> 10:28.668
     while I was in the pile.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.711
      Do you mean on purpose?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.463
      Definitely on purpose.

10:31.504 --> 10:33.298
   The hit came out of nowhere.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.216
        After the whistle.

10:34.258 --> 10:34.841
   And did the refs do anything?

10:34.884 --> 10:37.720
       They pay off the refs
to look the other way.

10:37.761 --> 10:38.971
           This is huge.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.347
     -The worse the injury...
-Yeah?

10:40.389 --> 10:41.514
      The bigger the bounty.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.350
            I'm sorry,
did you just say "bounty"?

10:42.390 --> 10:46.354
        The Stonewall coach
pays his players
to hurt the other team.

10:46.394 --> 10:48.230
  At least, that's what I heard.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.610
        [rock music playing
on earphones]

10:59.866 --> 11:01.701
  I'm heading home. Later, guys.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.912
          See you, dude.

11:07.207 --> 11:09.085
     [music continues playing
on earphones]

11:09.960 --> 11:11.671
           [clattering]

11:12.171 --> 11:13.047
         [metal clanging]

11:16.549 --> 11:17.677
           [music fades]

11:23.515 --> 11:24.933
           Aw, hell no.

11:28.895 --> 11:30.690
    [music playing on speakers]

11:30.730 --> 11:32.316
    [Munroe] Get away from me!

11:33.859 --> 11:35.152
         [Munroe screams]

11:42.784 --> 11:44.202
           Munroe, what
the hell happened?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.371
       Some guys jumped me.

11:46.413 --> 11:48.039
         One of them swung
a golf club at my knee.

11:48.081 --> 11:50.209
   I'm gonna call an ambulance.
Did you see their faces?

11:50.250 --> 11:50.960
             No, man.
They were wearing masks.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.254
         -[Munroe groans]
-We don't need to
have seen their faces.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.880
   We know exactly who they are.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.674
    [Munroe continues groaning]

11:57.716 --> 11:59.342
        [breathing deeply]

12:03.346 --> 12:04.389
         [Jughead] Hello?

12:05.265 --> 12:06.933
               Bret?

12:06.975 --> 12:08.727
              [Donna]
We're in here, Forsythe.

12:13.106 --> 12:15.109
      [Jughead] Where's Bret?

12:15.150 --> 12:18.403
          Sorry I'm late.
I had a prior obligation.

12:21.322 --> 12:22.783
        Well, what exactly
are we doing?

12:23.951 --> 12:26.202
           The final part
of your initiation,

12:26.245 --> 12:28.246
          where we really
get to know you.

12:28.288 --> 12:32.585
          When you tell us
your deepest, darkest secret.

12:32.625 --> 12:35.044
       -[scoffs] Seriously?
-Yeah.

12:35.086 --> 12:37.173
     And we are recording this
for the archives.

12:41.259 --> 12:42.635
    We'll tell you ours first.

12:49.184 --> 12:50.852
         When I was 13...

12:52.980 --> 12:54.774
    my uncle made a pass at me,

12:54.815 --> 12:58.277
      and when I told my mom,
she didn't believe me.

12:59.695 --> 13:00.863
           And that's...

13:02.865 --> 13:05.116
  when I started cutting myself.

13:16.044 --> 13:17.587
         When I was 14...

13:19.548 --> 13:21.801
     my father got me a hooker

13:21.841 --> 13:24.220
        and said, "Now it's
your time to be a man."

13:27.807 --> 13:31.351
      I cried the whole time
I was with her.

13:31.393 --> 13:35.940
    But I never told my father,
because the truth is...

13:37.899 --> 13:39.527
    I was afraid he'd kill me.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.111
             For real.

13:57.919 --> 14:00.505
      I used to be homeless.

14:00.548 --> 14:04.467
        I'd crash underneath
this bridge by the dock
on the Southside.

14:05.385 --> 14:07.178
   It was kind of a rough place.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.179
      There was this one guy
named Doc,

14:08.179 --> 14:11.850
     he would stay up all night
just to make sure the junkies
didn't mess with me.

14:13.977 --> 14:15.144
           Then one day,

14:16.230 --> 14:18.941
    these drunken businessmen,

14:18.982 --> 14:22.068
         who'd heard about
our little shantytown,
they found Doc...

14:25.364 --> 14:26.823
   and beat the life out of him.

14:31.870 --> 14:34.081
          I didn't move,
I didn't say anything.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.418
            I watched.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.048
          I just watched.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.346
         [inhales deeply]

14:49.388 --> 14:51.639
           It's probably
my greatest shame.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.850
       I've never ever told
that story.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.269
    Not even to Betty. [scoffs]

15:02.150 --> 15:03.192
           [Toni] Babe.

15:04.110 --> 15:06.614
    T.T., whyfor the long face?

15:06.654 --> 15:08.490
            Babe, don't
lose your mind, [sighs]

15:08.532 --> 15:09.908
  but we've got a major problem.

15:13.913 --> 15:14.788
              [gasps]

15:17.582 --> 15:18.708
      What villainy is this?

15:20.501 --> 15:22.337
          Speak, fiends!

15:22.379 --> 15:25.506
        Mr. Honey threatened
to ban us all from prom
if we refused to cheer.

15:25.548 --> 15:27.592
  He said we'd ruin Spirit Week.

15:27.634 --> 15:29.510
   So you caved and betrayed me?

15:32.096 --> 15:33.765
              Well...

15:33.807 --> 15:35.017
  you may redeem yourselves yet.

15:36.559 --> 15:40.147
       Now, who shucketh off
the impostor Appleyard?

15:47.863 --> 15:49.072
          Come on, babe.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.033
         This isn't over.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.534
        Not by a long shot.

15:57.163 --> 15:59.207
        [Appleyard] Ladies,
eyes up front.

16:00.875 --> 16:02.378
     [indistinct conversation]

16:04.254 --> 16:05.673
       [Bret laughs] I just
came up with that.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.341
               Hey!

16:07.383 --> 16:09.384
         Oh, somebody call
animal control.

16:09.426 --> 16:10.385
      The Bulldogs are here.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.682
       You couldn't even wait
to play dirty on the field,
could you?

16:16.808 --> 16:17.308
            [chuckles]

16:17.350 --> 16:19.812
         That's how scared
you were of Munroe.

16:19.852 --> 16:22.063
       Hey, what's going on?

16:22.105 --> 16:25.234
       Jones, are you friends
with these welfare cases?

16:25.274 --> 16:26.402
             [scoffs]

16:27.235 --> 16:28.570
    What did you just call me?

16:28.611 --> 16:29.697
          I called you--

16:29.738 --> 16:30.780
             [groans]

16:30.822 --> 16:31.698
                No.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.659
            [grunting]

16:41.332 --> 16:42.793
        [cell door opening]

16:43.085 --> 16:44.086
               Hey.

16:45.712 --> 16:47.463
  [Frank] You all right, Archie?

16:47.505 --> 16:48.215
    I've been in worse fights.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.884
        Thanks for coming,
Uncle Frank.
I couldn't call Mom.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.594
         -She's got enough
to worry about.
-That makes sense.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.014
    Forsythe Jones, I presume?

16:56.056 --> 16:59.393
         I'm Gerald Brooks
from Yale Admissions.
Have a seat.

16:59.434 --> 17:01.269
        I'd like to start by
complimenting your writing.

17:03.980 --> 17:06.357
    I'm sensing H.P. Lovecraft
is an influence?

17:08.609 --> 17:09.944
               Yeah.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.779
           A major one.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.824
   [stammers] I'm sorry, I'm...

17:13.865 --> 17:16.743
   I guess I'm just not used to
people actually treating me
like a real writer.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.621
        Oh, well, at Yale,
everyone earns their spot.

17:19.663 --> 17:23.666
      Should you be accepted,
you will succeed or fail
on your own merits, Mr. Jones.

17:23.709 --> 17:24.835
            Understood.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.424
     [Frank] You wanna tell me
what happened?

17:31.467 --> 17:33.885
     Those Stonewall bastards
attacked my friend Munroe.

17:33.926 --> 17:35.887
        Busted up his knee
so that he can't play.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.556
        So you went looking
for payback?

17:40.933 --> 17:42.853
         Don't be ashamed.

17:42.894 --> 17:45.480
        I'm the last person
that should be
judging anyone, Archie.

17:45.521 --> 17:47.523
    Especially when it comes to
fighting for your friends.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.402
    Your dad was the same way.

17:51.028 --> 17:51.862
         What do you mean?

17:51.903 --> 17:54.990
       I mean that your dad
was pretty level-headed,
all things considered,

17:55.031 --> 17:58.242
  except when someone came after
a friend or a family member.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.869
        Then he'd turn into
a bit of a madman.

18:01.454 --> 18:03.082
     Yeah, he could be brutal
in a bar fight.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.044
       I can't even imagine
my dad throwing punches.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.712
       I mean, he taught me
every sport, but not boxing.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.256
          -Wait, you box?
-Yeah.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.758
      I was serious about it
for a while.

18:13.174 --> 18:14.759
               Damn.

18:14.801 --> 18:16.845
   Me too. I boxed in the Army.

18:16.886 --> 18:18.430
        -What weight class?
-Welterweight.

18:19.807 --> 18:20.682
        You any good at it?

18:22.351 --> 18:24.060
        Well, this one time
I boxed a bear.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.104
          [Frank laughs]

18:25.144 --> 18:26.646
          I need a huge favor, V.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.732
     Munroe was jumped outside
of Archie's gym last night.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.817
              I know.

18:30.858 --> 18:32.111
          Archie told me.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.320
           Poor Munroe.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.615
   He thinks Munroe was attacked
by someone from Stonewall Prep,

18:37.657 --> 18:41.161
      and based on the masks
those creeps were wearing,
I agree.

18:41.202 --> 18:43.329
      Probably, it was Bret.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.499
   And I want to break the story
Blue and Gold,

18:45.540 --> 18:48.669
         but I need proof
or a confession.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.046
       Reggie says he heard
Stonewall's throwing
a party tonight

18:51.087 --> 18:52.798
    to get everyone psyched up
for the game.

18:52.839 --> 18:56.050
        Do I smell another
classic B&V caper?

18:56.093 --> 19:00.096
  Just a V caper, unfortunately.

19:00.138 --> 19:02.807
    I can't get close to Bret.
He knows me.

19:02.849 --> 19:05.477
          But I was hoping
maybe you could go,

19:05.519 --> 19:08.564
            turn on your
femme fatale charm?

19:08.605 --> 19:09.105
            -I'm down.
-Great.

19:09.147 --> 19:11.316
       Would you be willing
to wear a wire?

19:11.357 --> 19:12.401
            Absolutely.

19:14.068 --> 19:16.571
            And I think
I have just the tonic

19:16.613 --> 19:18.406
    to help loosen Bret's lips.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.836
       Anything interesting
happen today?

19:35.173 --> 19:36.424
               Uh...

19:37.550 --> 19:38.218
           I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:38.259 --> 19:41.430
          Yeah, FP called
and told me everything,
so don't.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.516
           [Mary sighs]

19:44.557 --> 19:46.894
            And, Archie,
what's really upsetting

19:46.934 --> 19:48.936
              is that
when you needed someone,

19:48.979 --> 19:50.771
   you called Frank and not me.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.648
           Mom, please.

19:52.691 --> 19:53.942
    What is your deal with him?

19:53.983 --> 19:57.528
         Your Uncle Frank
is your classic ne'er-do-well.

19:57.570 --> 19:59.405
       The straw that broke
the camel's back

19:59.448 --> 20:02.241
        was when your father
took the blame for Frank's DUI.

20:02.617 --> 20:04.286
               What?

20:04.327 --> 20:06.747
        What, you're saying
the DUI on Dad's record
wasn't his fault?

20:06.788 --> 20:10.083
     According to the official
police report, it was.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.877
      But your father wasn't
behind the wheel that night.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.628
   After Frank went on a bender,

20:13.628 --> 20:17.382
      he crashed our car into
a telephone pole in Sycamore.

20:17.423 --> 20:20.551
      It was the third strike
against him,
so he would've done jail time,

20:20.594 --> 20:21.428
  so your father covered for him.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.765
           And you know
how Frank repaid him?
By skipping town the next day.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.599
      That's the kind of man
that Frank is.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.103
         Oh, and, Archie,

20:30.144 --> 20:31.813
            you can play
in the football game,

20:31.855 --> 20:33.606
  but otherwise you're grounded.

20:33.648 --> 20:35.358
  No car privileges for a month.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.153
              [sighs]

20:38.194 --> 20:40.489
      [upbeat music playing]

20:40.529 --> 20:43.282
          [Veronica] Bee,
from what people
are saying, this isn't just

20:43.325 --> 20:44.409
         a football party.

20:45.201 --> 20:45.786
       It's a football party

20:45.826 --> 20:49.538
       hosted by Stonewall's
lame-ass secret society.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.084
                Ah!

20:52.125 --> 20:54.461
         And there's Bret.

20:54.502 --> 20:57.213
  God, I can smell his privilege
from across the room.

20:57.964 --> 20:58.839
               Okay.

20:59.633 --> 21:00.884
           I'm going in.

21:00.925 --> 21:02.719
     [music continues playing]

21:03.845 --> 21:05.096
           Hiya, fellas.

21:05.137 --> 21:06.722
            I'm Monica.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.933
     You wouldn't happen to be
rum drinkers, by any chance?

21:08.976 --> 21:11.979
        'Cause if you are,
I'm taking orders.

21:12.019 --> 21:14.690
        Go back to my room,
undress, and wait for me.

21:15.147 --> 21:15.691
            Excuse me?

21:15.691 --> 21:18.109
           What? You said
you were taking orders.

21:18.151 --> 21:19.611
          [Bret laughing]

21:19.653 --> 21:21.028
        [Veronica laughing]

21:23.573 --> 21:25.409
  Would you like some rum or not?

21:25.450 --> 21:26.785
           It's spiced.

21:26.826 --> 21:28.953
      Yeah, sure. Pour away.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.580
       [Bret] The Stallions
are undefeated,

21:31.623 --> 21:32.332
               15-0.

21:32.374 --> 21:35.585
      And that winning streak
is gonna continue,
right, boys?

21:35.626 --> 21:37.671
            [all] Yeah!

21:38.337 --> 21:39.964
          Oh, thank you.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.925
        Especially now that
Riverdale's top dog
is out of the mix.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.219
    It's all over social media.

21:44.927 --> 21:46.721
    Thatta girl. Set the trap.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.891

on the opposing team

21:49.932 --> 21:53.019
        randomly victimized
right before the big game.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.395
    It's quite a stroke of luck
for you.

21:54.438 --> 21:55.564
            Nah, doll.

21:56.605 --> 21:57.982
       We make our own luck.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.240
            Come here.

22:06.365 --> 22:07.409
        [Jughead] Veronica?

22:08.451 --> 22:09.327
             Jughead?

22:09.368 --> 22:09.869
             Jughead?

22:09.911 --> 22:12.497
        Veronica? I thought
your name was--

22:12.538 --> 22:14.415
        Monica. Yes, it is.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.500
               Uh...

22:16.751 --> 22:18.420
            Excuse us.

22:18.461 --> 22:19.421
      [softly] What the hell
are you doing here?

22:19.462 --> 22:20.963
     What are you doing here?

22:21.006 --> 22:22.423
       I go to school here.

22:22.465 --> 22:24.217
       Why are you in a wig?

22:24.259 --> 22:26.761
         Since when are you
part of a secret society?

22:27.261 --> 22:27.971
               What?

22:27.971 --> 22:31.892
          Does Betty know?
'Cause if not,
she just found out.

22:34.560 --> 22:37.189
         I didn't tell you
because it's a secret society.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.357
          Four months ago,
you hated those guys.

22:39.398 --> 22:41.526
       You wanted to drop out
and come back to Riverdale.

22:41.567 --> 22:42.736
        Yeah, but I stayed.

22:42.778 --> 22:43.944
        And you know what,
I'm glad I stayed.

22:43.987 --> 22:44.820
   I got a book contract, Betty.

22:44.863 --> 22:48.616
         Don't forget about
your Yale interview,
thanks to your new friends.

22:48.657 --> 22:50.451
            Yeah, okay.
I got an interview with Yale

22:50.493 --> 22:51.952
       because I'm a member
of the society.

22:51.994 --> 22:54.998
         If I get accepted,
it's because of my writing.

22:55.039 --> 22:57.291
     Does that really make me
such a horrible person?

22:58.710 --> 22:59.586
                No.

22:59.877 --> 23:02.213
                No.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.883
          But I hate that
we're keeping secrets
from each other.

23:04.924 --> 23:06.384
         I thought we were
done with that.

23:06.425 --> 23:08.053
           Yeah. [sighs]

23:08.095 --> 23:09.887
  Okay, that's where I messed up.

23:10.513 --> 23:11.556
            I'm sorry.

23:12.932 --> 23:14.558
      I should have told you
about Quill and Skull.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.894
            It's fine.

23:16.936 --> 23:18.396
         What was Veronica
even doing there?

23:18.438 --> 23:19.564
        She was helping me.

23:21.607 --> 23:22.317
            With what?

23:22.358 --> 23:27.239
     She was trying to get Bret
to brag about attacking Munroe.

23:27.279 --> 23:29.865
      Some much-needed proof
for my article.

23:30.616 --> 23:32.076
         Did Bret confess?

23:32.118 --> 23:32.786
            Not quite.

23:32.827 --> 23:36.498
     He was dancing around it,
but then you blew her cover.

23:36.539 --> 23:39.084
         Oh, so I messed up
a classic B&V scam?

23:39.125 --> 23:40.210
             Mmm-hmm.

23:40.251 --> 23:41.502
   How can I make it up to you?

23:43.087 --> 23:45.673
       I don't think there's
anything you could do.

23:45.714 --> 23:49.344
      I'll just have to file
my story with quotes
from unnamed sources.

23:49.385 --> 23:50.636
      Which I have plenty of.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.638
      Is it going to enough?

23:52.681 --> 23:54.682
            Truthfully,
I'm not very hopeful.

23:59.813 --> 24:00.855
          [door opening]

24:03.692 --> 24:04.567

24:05.192 --> 24:06.068
               Yeah?

24:06.903 --> 24:07.362
          We should talk.

24:07.403 --> 24:09.448
             [panting]
Yeah, sure thing, Arch.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.366
       Everything all right?

24:12.409 --> 24:14.118
    Mom told me about the DUI.

24:17.663 --> 24:18.123
           [Frank] I...

24:20.250 --> 24:21.625
        I was going through
a rough patch.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.711
      I was back in Riverdale
in between tours.

24:24.712 --> 24:26.088
   I was just having trouble...

24:26.756 --> 24:27.339
             dealing.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.468
     This is before I realized
I needed counseling

24:29.509 --> 24:31.385
      for what I went through
in Desert Storm.

24:33.137 --> 24:36.057
         I don't remember
much of that night.
That's not surprising.

24:36.098 --> 24:37.476
        But when I woke up
the next morning,

24:37.517 --> 24:38.934
           your dad had
already taken the blame.

24:41.061 --> 24:44.732
     I never would have asked
Fred to do that for me,
Archie. Never.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.611
     But he did it. Because...

24:48.862 --> 24:50.279
    Because that's who he was.

24:51.530 --> 24:52.740
          And I took off,

24:52.781 --> 24:54.201
     because that's who I was.

24:55.701 --> 24:58.163
   I was angry, I was messed up.

24:58.204 --> 24:59.748
        I figured I needed
to clear my head

24:59.788 --> 25:01.625
        before I could make
things right with your dad,

25:01.665 --> 25:02.834
          and guess what,

25:02.875 --> 25:04.419
     I never got that chance.

25:12.719 --> 25:15.846
        [Hiram] It's quite
the operation you have here.

25:15.888 --> 25:18.807
    And you've already secured
some sales from restaurants,
I hear.

25:18.849 --> 25:20.602
    With a touching story about

25:20.644 --> 25:22.729
                     no less.

25:22.770 --> 25:23.688
        Don't worry, Daddy.

25:23.730 --> 25:27.192
    I may not be able to serve
rum at La Bonne Nuit,
but I can make it here.

25:27.817 --> 25:28.777
            About that.

25:30.319 --> 25:31.654
          "Veronica Luna,

25:31.695 --> 25:32.447
       you are hereby served

25:32.489 --> 25:36.617
   with a cease-and-desist order
due to a patent infringement."

25:39.246 --> 25:41.539
   One of the restaurant owners
you gave a bottle to

25:41.580 --> 25:42.289
       is a friend of mine.

25:42.289 --> 25:45.501
      I had my chemist compare
your concoction to Lodge Rum,

25:45.544 --> 25:47.127
   and while you've embellished
the recipe I own

25:47.170 --> 25:48.880
     with all those... spices,

25:48.922 --> 25:50.339
    the core remains the same.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.340
           Which means,

25:51.383 --> 25:55.929
    if you make another bottle,
I will sue you and shut
this whole operation down.

25:59.432 --> 26:00.392
               Or...

26:03.185 --> 26:04.229
         we could team up.

26:06.021 --> 26:08.567

           You wanted me
to go straight, I have.

26:18.201 --> 26:20.287
              And yet,
you won't accept my help.

26:21.579 --> 26:22.454
               Why?

26:24.124 --> 26:25.000
           Out of spite?

26:26.917 --> 26:28.420
               Maybe

26:28.461 --> 26:30.337
      it's too late. Maybe...

26:32.298 --> 26:36.176
          too much damage
has been done, Daddy.

26:37.636 --> 26:39.096
    That's what it feels like.

26:42.349 --> 26:43.768
               Okay.

26:43.809 --> 26:45.644
   Well, if that's how you feel,
I should go.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.236

27:08.542 --> 27:10.795
     Mr. Jones, may I come in?

27:10.836 --> 27:13.464
         Uh, yeah. Sorry,
it's so messy in here.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.299
          I've heard from
one of your classmates

27:15.342 --> 27:17.760
       that your girlfriend
is working on

27:17.801 --> 27:19.929
  some kind of salacious article

27:19.971 --> 27:22.390
       that could be a stain
on our school,

27:22.432 --> 27:25.559
         and I'm wondering
if you couldn't possibly

27:26.102 --> 27:27.144
          discourage her.

27:27.186 --> 27:29.189
              [sighs]

27:29.230 --> 27:31.316
            Mr. DuPont,
I'm not gonna tell Betty

27:31.357 --> 27:33.652
           what she can
and can't write. That's...

27:33.692 --> 27:35.444
    Well, it's just not the way
our relationship works.

27:37.238 --> 27:38.114
              [sighs]

27:39.365 --> 27:41.451
      If that's gonna affect
my chances at Yale...

27:43.827 --> 27:46.955
             Nonsense.
I appreciate the candor.

27:46.998 --> 27:47.874
           And in fact,

27:47.915 --> 27:49.834
         the other reason
I stopped by

27:49.875 --> 27:52.961
     was to invite you to sit
with myself and Mr. Brooks

27:53.003 --> 27:55.006
       in the alumni section
of the game.

27:55.714 --> 27:56.924
      Hope to see you there.

28:05.724 --> 28:07.184
              [Archie]
How bad does it hurt, Munroe?

28:07.227 --> 28:07.935
         If I stand on it
for more than ten minutes,

28:07.977 --> 28:10.563
       it feels like someone

play through the pain,

at Stonewall Prep--

a story based on hearsay.

29:23.135 --> 29:27.390

that you agreed to deliver.

your classmates
and your school.

    And I saw how happy he was.

38:23.342 --> 38:25.552
   A year ago, he was in juvie,
fighting to stay alive,

38:25.594 --> 38:26.594
            but now...

38:27.679 --> 38:28.972
            who knows?

38:29.014 --> 38:30.349
         Maybe you helped
change his life.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.231
                   Cheryl,

38:38.273 --> 38:40.400
            the reason
I wanted us to meet...

38:40.443 --> 38:43.653
      That snow cone I licked
at the game gave me
a wicked idea,

38:43.695 --> 38:44.612
   but I need your help with it.

38:45.155 --> 38:46.949
         Wicked? Do tell.

38:48.576 --> 38:49.617
       [Veronica] Try this.

38:54.706 --> 38:55.583
               Yum.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.376
              What is
this delightsome elixir?

38:58.418 --> 38:59.545
           It's my rum,

39:00.463 --> 39:03.007
   mixed with your maple syrup.

39:03.757 --> 39:05.342
         It tastes like...

39:05.384 --> 39:06.719
      breakfast on the beach.

39:07.552 --> 39:08.429
            No, Cheryl.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.141
       It tastes like money.

39:17.103 --> 39:19.273
   [Mr. Honey] I'm very pleased
you came around, Betty.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.067
   Very pleased, indeed. This...

39:21.733 --> 39:23.402
       is a stellar article.

39:23.443 --> 39:25.237
         It's great press
for our school.

39:25.278 --> 39:26.530
   Even though we lost the game.

39:27.822 --> 39:29.240
    We may have lost the game,

39:29.282 --> 39:31.786
   but we haven't lost the war.

39:31.827 --> 39:34.413
       I've been doing more
and more research
on Stonewall Prep,

39:34.454 --> 39:38.376
         and did you know
that they have
a world-class quiz team?

39:38.416 --> 39:43.047
   And the captain of that team
is none other than
athlete, scholar, scumbag

39:43.088 --> 39:44.465
        Bret Weston Wallis?

39:45.132 --> 39:46.884
               Yes.

39:46.925 --> 39:49.887
       But that championship
is only a few weeks away,

39:49.929 --> 39:51.304
   and Riverdale doesn't even...

39:53.849 --> 39:54.849
           have a team.

39:57.686 --> 39:58.813
            Ms. Cooper,

39:59.771 --> 40:01.231
       are you volunteering?

40:02.273 --> 40:04.110
       Because I would love

40:04.150 --> 40:06.862
        to get my hands on
at least one trophy this year.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.030
         Principal Honey,

40:10.365 --> 40:12.076
      at this point in time,

40:12.117 --> 40:14.702
          there is nothing
that I would enjoy more

40:14.744 --> 40:17.706
    than to give Stonewall Prep
a royal ass-kicking.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.625
         [exhales sharply]

40:21.293 --> 40:24.213
           Then you have
my full support, Captain.

40:26.757 --> 40:27.882
              [sighs]

40:32.972 --> 40:33.931
          [Jughead] Dad?

40:35.349 --> 40:36.684
         What's going on?

40:36.724 --> 40:38.436
          Well, I felt it
only appropriate

40:38.476 --> 40:40.813
     that your father be here
to celebrate with us.

40:41.313 --> 40:42.398
          Celebrate what?

40:42.440 --> 40:44.525
        You'll be receiving
official word

40:44.567 --> 40:46.443
     by the end of next week,
but, uh, you--

40:46.485 --> 40:48.195
      You got into Yale, boy.

40:48.237 --> 40:49.780
            -[laughing]
-[gasps]

40:49.822 --> 40:52.157
         Yeah. First Jones
to go to college!

40:52.199 --> 40:54.869
      And an Ivy League one,
at that. Here.

40:54.909 --> 40:57.788
    [gasps] I don't understand.

40:57.829 --> 40:59.456
        -[glasses clinking]
-[Francis] To Jughead.

40:59.498 --> 41:01.500
       And to Bret, as well.

41:03.251 --> 41:05.211
    Yeah, I got into Yale too.

41:05.253 --> 41:06.630
        And, uh, who knows,

41:06.672 --> 41:09.132
       maybe if we're lucky,
we'll be roomies again.

41:22.563 --> 41:23.688
         Save your tears,

41:24.690 --> 41:26.065
        no one's watching.

41:28.860 --> 41:29.945
               Bret.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.614
   You got your wish, Ponytail.

41:32.864 --> 41:34.992
   Forsythe isn't going to Yale.

41:35.034 --> 41:38.454
     So, I guess it'll just be
you and me in New Haven.
