03:00.700 --> 03:02.500
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

03:32.300 --> 03:33.500
Mr. Wilson.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.100
Mr. Wilson?

03:39.500 --> 03:40.800
Mr. Wilson?

03:48.400 --> 03:51.100
Poor old Mr. Wilson must be so sick.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.400
No wonder he ain't up.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.800
Wow!

04:04.600 --> 04:07.600
His heart sounds like our washing machine!

04:14.600 --> 04:15.600
Oh, no.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.100
He's growing extra skin.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.900
His tongue's very ugly...

04:45.700 --> 04:47.600
...and blue and spotty.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.100
Cool!

04:59.000 --> 05:00.600
He feels warm.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.900
He has a temperature.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.300
I know what you need.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.200
You need an aspirin.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.800
Don't you ever come back!
Do you hear me?

06:31.900 --> 06:33.100
Never!

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Starting part time will give you a chance
to ease back into it.

06:37.100 --> 06:40.100
I mean, managing shopping malls
can't be much more difficult...

06:40.200 --> 06:41.800
...than managing Dennis.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.200
Where have you been?

06:44.700 --> 06:45.700
Dennis?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Dennis?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.900
I was at Mr. Wilson's house.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.100
And, boy, is he sick.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.000
He's got a fever, and he's burning up.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.100
I better call Martha.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.700
You didn't bother him, did you?

07:01.100 --> 07:03.200
No, but I gave him an aspirin.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.100
And he don't like them any better than me.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.200
You shouldn't visit people
so early in the morning.

07:10.300 --> 07:13.500
That's the only time I know for sure
they'll be home.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.300
Hello, George. Alice Mitchell.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.600
Are you feeling all right?
Dennis said that you...

07:17.600 --> 07:18.600
<i>Feeling all right!</i>

07:18.700 --> 07:22.800
<i>Your son just shot an aspirin</i>
<i>down my throat with a slingshot!</i>

07:22.900 --> 07:24.300
I'm very sorry.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.700
<i>You better talk to him!</i>

07:25.800 --> 07:27.100
We'll talk to him.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.000
<i>When I was a child,</i>
<i>none of this would have been tolerated!</i>

07:30.300 --> 07:31.900
'Bye. 'Bye.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.500
Hi.

07:41.700 --> 07:44.700
Did you shoot an aspirin
into Mr. Wilson's mouth?

07:44.700 --> 07:48.200
I didn't want him to bite off my fingers
with his big, fake teeth.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.200
Those things are sharp!

07:51.300 --> 07:54.700
George said Dennis shot an aspirin
into his mouth with a slingshot.

07:54.800 --> 07:55.900
What slingshot?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.900
- Do you have a slingshot?
- I'm not sure.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.300
Give it to me.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.800
Mr. Wilson is very angry with you.

08:07.300 --> 08:09.800
I thought he was sick.
I was only trying to help.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.900
You go sit in the corner
and think about what you've done.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.100
- For how long?
- Until you're sorry.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.600
Oh, good. I'm sorry now.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.300
He can't sit in the corner.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.200
I have to take him
to Margaret Wade's house.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.800
Margaret's house!

08:23.800 --> 08:27.100
I didn't do anything bad enough
to deserve to go to her house.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.000
She's a lunatic. I'll go crazy.
She tortures me.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.900
She's mean. She's ugly.
She doesn't share!

08:33.900 --> 08:38.400
I arranged with Mrs. Wade for you
to go to their house while I work.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.799
Are you serious?

08:40.900 --> 08:43.799
You can't spend the summer unsupervised.
You're out of school.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.100
I'll go back.

08:45.200 --> 08:49.200
Your mother made arrangements.
That's it! I don't want any arguments.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.400
My life is falling apart.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.400
Hello, George.

09:07.300 --> 09:10.200
Let me take that off your hands. Sorry.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.200
I'm <i>...</i>

09:16.300 --> 09:18.500
I'm sorry about this morning.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.300
I won't mince words, Mitchell.

09:23.100 --> 09:25.200
Your kid is driving me nuts.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.900
- I'll talk to him again.
- Maybe it isn't talk that he needs.

09:28.900 --> 09:32.800
When my dad had something important
to tell me, he told me with his belt.

09:32.900 --> 09:35.300
That's not how I deal with my son,
Mr. Wilson.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.700
However you deal with him...

09:36.800 --> 09:41.400
...he hasn't learned you don't shoot
an aspirin down a fellow's throat!

09:41.500 --> 09:44.800
- Mr. Wilson, he's five.
- When I was five, I had some respect.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.700
You were probably an exceptional boy.

09:47.800 --> 09:51.600
In 1925, I was not the exception,
I was the rule.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.000
I'll make sure
Dennis doesn't come by anymore.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.900
Careful how you say it.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.400
I don't want everybody to think
I'm a child-hater or an ogre.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.700
I'm a reasonable man
who expects reasonable treatment...

10:02.700 --> 10:04.700
...from his neighbors and their children.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.400
I was with the post office
for more than 43 years, and never once...

10:08.500 --> 10:09.600
I'm running a little late.

10:09.700 --> 10:12.600
I'll come by after work
and we can continue the conversation.

10:12.700 --> 10:16.100
There's nothing to continue.
I've said my piece. We'll leave it at that.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.500
The boy cannot come over here
unless he behaves himself.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.000
He won't be over at all.

10:21.100 --> 10:25.100
Now don't make me out to be a grump.
I didn't say '<i>'</i> never.'<i>'</i> I said...

10:25.200 --> 10:27.100
I really have to go.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Well, now, don't <i>...</i>

10:33.100 --> 10:34.700
Have a good day.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.100
He's out of school now.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.700
He can't spend all his free time here.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.400
I'm not the bad guy in this, Mitchell.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.000
I'm the victim!

10:45.300 --> 10:47.900
George, who were you shouting at?

10:48.500 --> 10:51.900
Mitchell, and I wasn't shouting.
I was making my point.

10:52.100 --> 10:55.500
It's not right that his youngster
can run wild doing as he pleases...

10:55.600 --> 10:58.300
...without regard to people or property.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.400
He's only a boy, George.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.500
He'll knot my rope once too often.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.400
I can't stand that kid! He's a menace!

11:05.700 --> 11:10.100
You'd better come in and have breakfast.
We're due at the Garden Club at 9:00.

11:10.900 --> 11:15.300
Today is an important day for me, and
I'm already in a lather because of that kid.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.700
I don't know if I'll even be able
to enjoy my moment of triumph.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.800
Don't get your hopes up.

11:21.100 --> 11:24.400
There are lots of other gardens in town
just as nice as yours.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.400
Please! I'm a shoe-in.

11:29.300 --> 11:33.200
Who else has a night-blooming mock orchid
flowering this year?

11:34.900 --> 11:37.500
It's an awfully homely looking plant.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.700
Hang the looks of the thing!

11:39.700 --> 11:42.600
It opens before your eyes
in the light of the full moon.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.300
It's a marvel, Martha.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.800
Forty years to mature and blossom.

11:47.100 --> 11:50.200
The flower opens and withers
in a matter of moments.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.900
There isn't a gardener in town
with a plant that requires...

11:53.000 --> 11:56.700
...a 40-year investment
for 10 seconds of splendor.

12:09.700 --> 12:12.100
How do you feel about me working?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.300
A lot of moms work.

12:17.400 --> 12:21.200
The best I could do finding someone
to watch you is Mrs. Wade.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.700
What about Joey?
Did you think about him?

12:26.800 --> 12:30.300
What if he comes over?
He'll think I moved.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.800
Joey's mother made plans
with Mrs. Wade just like I did.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.100
Joey's at Margaret's house.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.600
Do it!

12:47.100 --> 12:49.600
- I can make you.
- How?

12:51.200 --> 12:52.800
I'll slug you back.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.700
- You can't hit a girl.
- I can too.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.200
Try it. I'll scream
so awfully, bloody, deadly horrible...

12:59.300 --> 13:01.300
...my mom'll think you tried to murder me.

13:01.400 --> 13:06.300
I'll say you did and she'll believe it.
Because boys are like that and girls aren't.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.900
That really stinks.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Quit wasting time.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.200
Mush your lips together
and let's get this over with.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.300
Close your eyes!

13:25.000 --> 13:26.200
Kiss me.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.100
All right. Let's go.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.000
Dennis, come on.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.600
Oh, gosh.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.500
Acting like a baby.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.500
Get up!

13:44.800 --> 13:46.500
Right this instant!

13:47.500 --> 13:49.700
Don't you dare embarrass me!

13:51.400 --> 13:53.700
Fine, I'll drag you inside.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.400
You guys are the boring ones.
There's lots to do.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.800
Oh, really? Like what?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
We could practice singing songs.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.400
Or put on a play...

14:07.500 --> 14:09.200
...or a puppet show.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.900
- We could bury you alive.
- I could pound your face.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.500
It doesn't matter, anyways, Margaret.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.900
We'll be leaving soon
and we have work to do.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.900
We're going to make a fort.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.800
You can't leave unless I go with you,
or I'll tell on you.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.100
So, tough kitty paws, I'm going.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.400
Climb down from there. I'll get my purse.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.100
This thing's been here our whole life
and we never knew it.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.900
- Do you think anybody lives in it?
- Just squirrels and birds.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.800
It looks kind of junky.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.500
We'll fix it up.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.900
Good. I'll be the decorator.

15:17.900 --> 15:22.200
We'll put on a special room for the babies
and a powder room for guests.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.000
Forts don't have powder rooms.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.500
Really?

15:26.600 --> 15:29.600
Where do the soldiers' wives go
to freshen up?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.300
Soldiers don't have wives, stupid.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.500
Don't call me stupid, baby rump kisser!

15:39.700 --> 15:42.500
It won't be a fort. It'll be a house.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.200
A love nest.

15:45.100 --> 15:48.400
Let's go up and see
what color carpet we should get.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.600
Do forts got carpet?

15:51.000 --> 15:51.900
Nope.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.300
Forts don't got carpet!

15:54.900 --> 15:56.700
They do now, hot lips!

16:01.000 --> 16:03.700
The Selection Committee has informed...

16:03.900 --> 16:06.300
...Mrs. Butterwell and I...

16:06.500 --> 16:11.300
...that this summer's Floraganza
will be held in the garden of <i>...</i>

16:15.600 --> 16:17.400
Can you read this here?

16:21.200 --> 16:23.700
You take these and I'll take those.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.900
There we go. The garden of...

16:30.400 --> 16:32.000
...George Wilson!

16:42.600 --> 16:46.700
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three Mississippi...

16:46.800 --> 16:49.200
...four Mississippi, five Mississippi.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.500
Six Mississippi...

16:50.600 --> 16:55.000
...seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi,
nine Mississippi.

16:55.300 --> 16:58.300
Gunther, are you watching
where everybody goes?

16:59.500 --> 17:00.600
Yep.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.599
Girls. Now <i>...</i>

17:09.400 --> 17:10.700
Let's go!

17:14.200 --> 17:17.099
You know,
I was unbeatable at hide-and-seek.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.800
Hiding or seeking?

17:18.800 --> 17:21.400
Both. I had a nose for hiding places.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.200
I wouldn't think you'd be much good
at hiding.

17:24.300 --> 17:25.500
Why not?

17:25.700 --> 17:27.500
Weren't you a fat boy?

17:28.900 --> 17:30.300
I was husky.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.700
Ready or not, here I come!

17:36.800 --> 17:38.000
I see Joey and Mike!

17:38.100 --> 17:39.500
Run, Mikey!

17:40.000 --> 17:41.500
He's cheating.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.400
What are you doing?

17:45.300 --> 17:49.100
Dennis is cheating.
He's using the Beckman kid as a spy.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.700
Leave them alone, George.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.900
I'll even things up.

17:54.200 --> 17:58.800
Gunther, I'm just talking to your daddy
on the telephone.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.900
He's going to the ice-cream store.
He wants to take you with him.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.300
Hurry up and go home!

18:08.600 --> 18:10.100
Now it's fair.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.700
You lied to a toddler, George.

18:16.900 --> 18:20.100
Think how disappointed he will be
when he gets home.

18:20.200 --> 18:24.200
He better get used to it.
Disappointment will be a big part of his life.

18:24.300 --> 18:28.200
He's a foot short for his age.
And he's cross-eyed.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.200
Ain't that a pretty sight?

19:31.100 --> 19:34.700
I bet they don't even lock their doors.

19:40.700 --> 19:43.100
You won't notice a toy store
on the first level...

19:43.200 --> 19:44.600
...but my suggestion is this:

19:44.700 --> 19:48.900
Give the toy store six months free rent
to move up to the third level.

19:53.900 --> 19:58.300
When I go to the mall with my little boy,
we always visit the toy store.

19:58.800 --> 20:03.500
He knows he won't get anything unless
it's a special occasion, but like every kid...

20:03.600 --> 20:05.000
...he wants to look around...

20:05.100 --> 20:07.700
Could you spare us the family anecdotes?

20:09.700 --> 20:12.500
There's always a lot of traffic in toy stores.

20:12.600 --> 20:16.200
If people have to go up to the third level
to visit the toy store...

20:16.300 --> 20:19.500
...then they have to go through
two other levels to get there.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.700
That's apparent to anyone with children.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.100
And you have to assume
that potential tenants...

20:24.200 --> 20:26.800
...might have kids and would know that...

20:26.900 --> 20:30.900
...and it might entice them
to take up space in the other levels.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.900
That's all I'm saying.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.500
We could have carried up a lot more stuff...

20:41.600 --> 20:45.600
...if you didn't have to bring that idiotic doll
and all her junk!

20:45.700 --> 20:49.500
She's not idiotic!
She's an important training tool.

20:49.600 --> 20:53.800
You know why men are so lousy
when it comes to taking care of babies?

20:54.100 --> 20:56.300
They have better things to do.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.500
Like what? Play golf and drink beer?

20:59.500 --> 21:04.400
No, like hunting, having wars, driving cars,
shaving, cleaning fish.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.900
Do you know how to do that?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.100
Me?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.500
Margaret.

21:08.700 --> 21:09.400
Oh, okay.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.100
If you didn't have women,
you wouldn't have babies...

21:12.300 --> 21:14.300
...and you wouldn't have people.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.700
If you didn't have men,
who'd drive the ladies to the hospital?

21:20.400 --> 21:25.400
Most important, they marry the women,
then the women can go and get the baby.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.700
The baby is in her stomach!

21:28.200 --> 21:32.800
She has to get it installed.
Her stomach isn't just filled up with babies.

21:32.900 --> 21:36.200
- Who installs them?
- A minister and a doctor.

21:36.400 --> 21:37.800
- How?
- How?

21:38.700 --> 21:40.600
She wants to know how?

21:47.300 --> 21:49.200
Tell me, Dennis, how?

21:49.400 --> 21:51.300
The bellybutton. It opens up.

21:51.800 --> 21:56.300
- How come men have them?
- So they don't look weird in bathing suits.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.600
Okay, on the count of three...

22:00.800 --> 22:02.500
...move your hand.

22:02.600 --> 22:03.600
One.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.200
Two.

22:09.800 --> 22:10.900
Three!

22:16.100 --> 22:19.100
Okay, this time on the count of four.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.100
One.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.600
Two.

22:23.800 --> 22:24.900
Three.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.600
Four!

22:28.400 --> 22:32.200
Joey, you hold the hammer
and, Margaret, you hold the nail.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.200
We did a pretty good job.

22:49.300 --> 22:52.100
- How about a little paint?
- Couldn't hurt.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.500
- You got any?
- My dad does.

23:02.100 --> 23:05.400
- Give me my doll, you jerk!
- I don't have it!

23:06.600 --> 23:09.700
- Give it to me! Dennis!
- I didn't take your doll.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.200
It's not here. Somebody took it.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.300
We've been with you.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.900
Do you guys swear you didn't take it?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.100
Yep.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.400
I've been robbed!

23:32.500 --> 23:37.400
You don't understand.
Baby Louise is a very expensive antique.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.900
Nobody robbed your doll.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.000
- Maybe a bear ate it.
- What?

23:42.400 --> 23:45.200
Yeah, there's no robbers in our town.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.200
What are you eating there, sport?

24:44.700 --> 24:45.700
A apple.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.500
Hi, Mr. Mitchell.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.800
Hello, Polly. Come on in.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.200
- What's the helmet for?
- My girlfriend used to baby-sit for Dennis.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.000
She said to bring a helmet and wear pants.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.800
I'm looking for Polly.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.900
You're Mickey?

27:53.200 --> 27:54.300
Yeah.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.400
She's up in my mom's bathroom
using the armpit perfume.

27:58.500 --> 28:02.700
She says you're such a stud,
she gets nervous and sweats a lot.

28:03.800 --> 28:04.800
Cool.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.800
Come on in.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.400
Tastes funny.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.200
Tastes like paint.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.500
And wood.

29:04.900 --> 29:07.200
I'll make us some sandwiches.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.500
'<i>'</i>'Do not cry, little locomotive,'...

29:28.600 --> 29:33.000
'<i>'...</i> said old Engine Number 99 to Huffy.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.700
'<i>'</i>'One day when you grow up,
you will realize...

29:37.800 --> 29:40.800
'<i>'</i>'... that all trains are impotent, important...

29:41.800 --> 29:44.000
'<i>'</i>'... even little mail trains."<i>'</i>

29:47.300 --> 29:48.900
How can a train grow?

29:49.000 --> 29:52.100
He eats all his coal
and gets plenty of sleep.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.400
No, what's the point of reading lies?

29:57.200 --> 30:00.500
It teaches kids to eat all their food...

30:00.600 --> 30:03.500
...and go to bed when they're supposed to.

30:03.600 --> 30:07.900
And not cry when mean cabooses
and boxcars make fun of them.

30:10.300 --> 30:11.800
This is so stupid.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.800
Are you ready to get out of here
and go to bed, yet?

30:14.900 --> 30:18.300
I'm not even wrinkled up yet.
Keep reading.

30:23.600 --> 30:28.500
'<i>'</i>'I will never be big enough to pull anything
but silly old mail cars,'...

30:29.100 --> 30:30.700
'<i>'...</i> sobbed Huffy.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.000
'<i>'</i> Sob <i>...</i>

30:35.700 --> 30:37.800
'<i>'</i> Sobbobed Huffy.'<i>'</i>

30:46.600 --> 30:48.400
Where are you going?

30:57.200 --> 31:00.000
I'm going to investigate Mitchell's garage.

31:00.100 --> 31:03.900
Dennis has been fooling around with paint.
I know it, and I will prove it.

31:04.200 --> 31:07.300
Aren't you taking this a bit far, George?

31:08.200 --> 31:09.800
He's only a boy.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.200
Kids!

32:24.800 --> 32:26.500
G.D. Wading pool!

32:38.200 --> 32:39.500
That's it!

33:37.600 --> 33:40.600
Gee, I guess those kids took off.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.600
I got him this time.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.000
Mitchell can't deny it.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.100
Sorry. Good night.

34:29.100 --> 34:31.100
He's only a boy, huh?

35:11.100 --> 35:12.700
Hi, Mrs. Wilson.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.800
Is Mr. Wilson up yet?

35:16.000 --> 35:17.500
Not yet, dear.

35:17.700 --> 35:20.100
How long do you think he's going to sleep?

35:20.200 --> 35:23.400
Not too much longer.
He's having his picture taken this morning.

35:23.600 --> 35:27.200
- For what?
- He's being honored for his garden.

35:28.300 --> 35:31.500
Do you think he would get mad
if I went upstairs?

35:32.300 --> 35:34.800
What do you want to go upstairs for?

35:34.800 --> 35:38.300
I made an '<i>'</i> I'm Sorry I Shot Paint
on Your Chicken'<i>'</i> card.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
That's very nice, Dennis.

35:41.300 --> 35:45.600
I'm kind of busy today,
so I won't have a chance to give it to him.

35:46.300 --> 35:48.400
I have to go to Margaret's house...

35:48.500 --> 35:51.500
...because we're getting poor,
and my mom's got a job now.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.200
Could I leave it by his whisker cutter?

35:54.600 --> 35:57.100
That's where I leave
my dad's '<i>'</i> Sorry'<i>'</i> cards.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.800
And it's a good time to say you're sorry.

35:59.900 --> 36:02.800
Grownup guys are happy in the morning
when they wake up.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.000
My dad's so happy...

36:04.100 --> 36:06.400
...he whistles
when he goes to the bathroom.

36:06.500 --> 36:09.200
The only time he isn't happy
is on Sunday morning...

36:09.300 --> 36:10.900
...when he and my mom wrestle.

36:10.900 --> 36:13.000
They like to be alone when they do that.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.200
I think it's because they take off
their shirts.

36:15.300 --> 36:16.900
Then they start to make funny noises...

36:17.000 --> 36:18.100
You can go up...

36:18.200 --> 36:21.200
...as long as you promise
not to disturb Mr. Wilson.

36:21.300 --> 36:22.600
I promise.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.500
You know what, Mrs. Wilson?

36:29.900 --> 36:31.000
What?

36:31.100 --> 36:34.000
You're the nicest old gal on the block.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.100
Hello.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.300
My name is Dennis Mitchell.

37:38.300 --> 37:41.000
I'm the doctor. Open up and say <i>...</i>

38:16.300 --> 38:17.300
Hello.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.100
Mr. Wilson.

38:28.300 --> 38:30.500
George? Are you ready?

38:31.200 --> 38:33.200
The photographer's here.

38:36.300 --> 38:38.100
I got a 9:30, ma'am.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.300
He'll be out any second.

38:41.500 --> 38:42.600
Sorry.

38:46.900 --> 38:47.900
George?

38:54.500 --> 38:57.300
That looks fine, Martha. Leave it alone.

38:59.100 --> 39:02.000
Martha, step back. You're in the picture.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.100
Very good.

39:06.500 --> 39:07.800
Now...

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
...smile.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.600
Hey, you.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Yeah, you. Come here.

40:14.800 --> 40:17.100
I haven't seen you around here before.

40:19.300 --> 40:22.000
Maybe because
I've never been around here.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.600
What are you up to?

40:23.700 --> 40:25.300
What's it to you?

40:25.400 --> 40:26.400
Now, look.

40:27.100 --> 40:30.800
I run a nice, clean town here
and I don't want any trouble.

40:31.200 --> 40:34.400
My advice to you
is just follow the sun out of here.

40:34.400 --> 40:38.200
Only reason I ain't moving on because
you stopped to give me the breeze.

41:03.800 --> 41:07.400
You have to go to two other levels
to get there and <i>...</i>

41:14.000 --> 41:15.900
Can I call you back?

41:19.100 --> 41:20.100
Hi, Mom.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.300
Good morning.

41:22.400 --> 41:25.600
I hear you're trying to beg off
the Oklahoma City trip.

41:26.100 --> 41:28.100
I asked that it be rescheduled.

41:28.400 --> 41:31.000
Have a Cub Scout meeting or something?

41:31.200 --> 41:34.500
My husband has a trip
that was scheduled before mine.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.700
If you two are traveling at the same time,
no one can watch your kid.

41:39.700 --> 41:41.100
Is that the problem?

41:41.100 --> 41:43.800
- It's not a problem, per se.
- Oh, good.

41:43.900 --> 41:48.000
Because if you want to blow off your trip,
I have to cover for you.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.600
And I have plans I can't break.

41:51.100 --> 41:53.100
I don't have kids but...

41:53.900 --> 41:55.600
...I do have a life.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.300
I'm sorry.

41:59.900 --> 42:02.000
I just won't be able to help you.

42:08.500 --> 42:09.600
God.

42:11.100 --> 42:13.200
- Okay.
- Who do we call first?

42:14.400 --> 42:16.500
Let's start with the A's.

42:16.700 --> 42:17.800
Vicki?

42:17.900 --> 42:19.300
- You call.
- No, you call.

42:22.000 --> 42:22.800
Hello.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.500
Hi. This is Mrs. Mitchell.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.700
Hi. Alice Mitchell.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.100
Hi. Alice Mitchell.

42:38.800 --> 42:39.500
No.

42:43.300 --> 42:45.300
This is Henry Mitchell.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.100
This is Henry Mitchell.

43:05.600 --> 43:06.800
You call.

43:21.200 --> 43:24.900
Hey, Mr. Wilson. I'm sleeping at your joint.

43:29.400 --> 43:33.000
- I brought you some grasshoppers.
- You shouldn't have.

43:33.300 --> 43:34.800
I'll take them, dear.

43:36.400 --> 43:39.500
Thank you so much, Martha. George.

43:39.800 --> 43:40.900
It's our pleasure.

43:40.900 --> 43:44.300
- You saved our lives.
- Save two, lose one.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.500
I'll call you just as soon as I arrive.

43:46.600 --> 43:49.100
- Do you have our number?
- Don't worry about a thing.

43:50.900 --> 43:54.300
I brought my own pillow
so I don't get my spit on yours.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.000
Thank you, dear.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.900
Be a good boy, okay?

44:03.100 --> 44:06.400
Mind your manners
and listen to Mr. And Mrs. Wilson.

44:10.500 --> 44:12.000
- Thanks again.
- Thank you.

44:14.700 --> 44:15.800
Honey?

44:18.200 --> 44:19.200
Bye-bye.

44:19.300 --> 44:21.500
Bring me something good.

44:21.600 --> 44:22.800
'Bye, sweetheart.

44:22.900 --> 44:24.400
'Bye, Dennis.

44:25.400 --> 44:29.600
George, take Dennis' suitcase
up to the guest room, please.

44:30.100 --> 44:33.400
- He's got arms.
- Don't start, dear.

44:35.600 --> 44:38.600
You know why I'm not crying?

44:40.200 --> 44:42.700
Because if I can't be with my parents...

44:42.800 --> 44:45.500
...the person I want to be with is you.

44:48.600 --> 44:51.800
I can't tell you how deeply moved I am.

45:18.100 --> 45:19.700
Don't do that, please.

45:19.800 --> 45:20.600
What?

45:20.600 --> 45:21.800
The cord.

45:21.900 --> 45:23.600
Stop that tapping.

45:27.900 --> 45:31.600
There's not a lot to do around the house
when it's raining out.

45:34.200 --> 45:36.600
- Do you wanna play cards?
- No.

45:39.100 --> 45:41.900
Want to put on your old Navy suit
and play war?

45:52.200 --> 45:54.600
- Is that pirates' gold?
- No.

45:55.400 --> 45:56.900
Is it real valuable?

45:57.600 --> 45:58.600
Yes.

45:59.600 --> 46:01.700
Is that why you keep it in your safe?

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Uh-huh.

46:04.500 --> 46:06.600
How come your safe looks like books?

46:08.600 --> 46:11.100
How come you ask so many questions?

46:11.700 --> 46:14.100
I've only been around for five years.

46:14.100 --> 46:16.200
There's a lot of stuff I don't know.

46:20.200 --> 46:22.200
The safe looks like books...

46:22.600 --> 46:26.000
...so if a thief does come in,
he won't recognize it.

46:26.700 --> 46:28.900
- Is a thief a robber?
- Yes.

46:29.100 --> 46:32.000
- Have you ever had a robber here?
- No.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.800
What's the combination to your lock?

46:36.600 --> 46:40.000
You're the last person in the world
I'd tell that to.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.600
You've got it wrote down someplace?

46:42.600 --> 46:44.000
It's in my head.

46:44.100 --> 46:47.800
- What's that mean?
- It means I know it. I remember it.

46:48.100 --> 46:51.800
- What if you forget it?
- I won't forget it. It's a familiar number.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.200
I won't forget it.

46:53.500 --> 46:55.100
What's that mean?

46:55.200 --> 46:59.800
It means it's a number
that I use all the time, so I won't forget it.

47:00.100 --> 47:01.900
I use it all the time.

47:02.600 --> 47:05.200
- I bet I know what it is.
- I doubt that.

47:05.500 --> 47:07.700
I bet it's your address.

47:08.600 --> 47:10.000
Know how I know?

47:10.000 --> 47:11.800
My friend has a bike lock...

47:11.900 --> 47:16.400
...and he uses his address
for the combination so he won't forget.

47:16.700 --> 47:18.800
- You're just as smart as him.
- He.

47:19.500 --> 47:22.700
You got everything figured out, don't you?

47:24.000 --> 47:28.500
I haven't figured out
how to get my work done...

47:28.600 --> 47:30.600
...with you in the house.

47:32.100 --> 47:33.800
That's a tough one.

47:51.200 --> 47:53.300
Are you wrinkled enough yet, Dennis?

47:55.400 --> 47:58.200
- Yep.
- Want me to come help you out of the tub?

47:58.700 --> 48:01.200
Not unless you want to see
what the stork saw.

48:26.600 --> 48:27.700
Cool!

48:28.000 --> 48:29.500
Old Faithful.

49:37.100 --> 49:40.900
- How old is this bed?
- It belonged to my mother.

49:41.300 --> 49:43.200
What's she sleeping on?

49:43.700 --> 49:45.800
She's been gone for many years, Dennis.

49:47.900 --> 49:49.700
- On business?
- No.

49:50.600 --> 49:52.200
She's in heaven.

49:53.100 --> 49:55.900
There's an awful lot of people in heaven.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.500
Especially old people.

50:10.100 --> 50:14.200
How about if I recite my favorite poem
when I was your age?

50:14.800 --> 50:17.000
- Is it about flowers and lambs?
- No.

50:17.900 --> 50:18.900
Okay.

50:21.500 --> 50:25.300
'<i>'</i> Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night

50:25.300 --> 50:27.800
'<i>'</i> Sailed off in a wooden shoe

50:28.500 --> 50:31.700
'<i>'</i> Sailed on a river of crystal light

50:31.800 --> 50:33.400
'<i>'</i> lnto a sea of dew

50:35.100 --> 50:38.200
'<i>'</i>'Where are you going
and what do you wish? '

50:38.600 --> 50:41.800
'<i>'</i> The old moon asked the three

50:41.900 --> 50:46.800
'<i>'</i>'We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in the beautiful sea

50:47.600 --> 50:50.500
<i>"'Nets of silver and gold have we! '</i>

50:50.900 --> 50:53.800
<i>"Said Wynken, Blynken, and Nod</i>

50:55.200 --> 50:58.300
<i>"Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes</i>

50:59.200 --> 51:01.300
<i>"And Nod is a little head</i>

51:02.700 --> 51:05.900
<i>"And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies</i>

51:06.400 --> 51:08.500
<i>"Is a wee one's trundle bed</i>

51:10.200 --> 51:13.200
<i>"Now shut your eyes while Mother sings</i>

51:13.300 --> 51:15.700
<i>"Of wonderful sights that be</i>

51:17.300 --> 51:20.300
<i>"And you shall see the beautiful things</i>

51:20.800 --> 51:24.100
<i>"As you rock in the misty sea</i>

51:24.200 --> 51:27.500

51:30.500 --> 51:31.900

51:32.800 --> 51:34.100

52:29.200 --> 52:31.500
New pajamas. God bless 'em.

52:53.400 --> 52:56.400
Poor thing.
I wish he'd get that hernia fixed.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
George, are you sleeping?

54:01.500 --> 54:03.800
I was until you started yakking.

54:04.200 --> 54:05.600
I'm sorry.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.100
Was Dennis in our bathroom?

54:10.800 --> 54:11.800
Yes.

54:12.300 --> 54:16.800
I think the little rat
put mouthwash in my nasal spray...

54:17.400 --> 54:20.100
...and toilet cleanser in my mouthwash.

54:21.500 --> 54:24.100
Why would he do something like that?

54:26.100 --> 54:27.600
Must you ask?

54:33.400 --> 54:34.600
Quiet!

54:36.600 --> 54:39.100
I recited a poem for Dennis tonight...

54:39.800 --> 54:42.500
...that my mother used to recite to me.

54:43.900 --> 54:45.800
I remembered every word.

54:48.300 --> 54:50.200
In some tiny measure...

54:50.500 --> 54:54.500
...my mother would be proud
I passed something on.

54:55.400 --> 54:57.000
It's 10:00, Martha.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.200
Don't start with the regrets.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.300
I would have been a good mother.

55:10.200 --> 55:12.800
And I would have made a swell fireman.

55:27.200 --> 55:30.600
- Where are you going?
- To make myself a cup of tea.

55:34.700 --> 55:37.800
I didn't decree
that we wouldn't have children.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.600
That was out of both our hands.

55:42.400 --> 55:45.900
This isn't about having children
or not having children.

55:46.500 --> 55:48.000
You miss the point.

55:49.400 --> 55:50.900
It's about...

55:52.300 --> 55:54.900
...my feeling something very good...

55:55.600 --> 55:58.100
...and not being able to tell you about it.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
Martha?

56:46.200 --> 56:48.200
I didn't mean to hurt you.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.100
I'm not terribly good
with feelings and emotions.

56:53.300 --> 56:57.400
There are a lot of subjects
I'd just as soon not bring up or discuss.

56:58.300 --> 57:01.200
I would have liked a son or a daughter.

57:02.700 --> 57:05.800
You couldn't fire the fatherly feelings
in me...

57:06.800 --> 57:08.400
...because they're not there.

57:09.400 --> 57:12.800
But that doesn't mean my feelings for you
have gone cold.

57:12.800 --> 57:14.600
That'll never happen.

57:15.700 --> 57:18.000
You've got all the love I have.

57:20.400 --> 57:21.900
Remember this?

57:22.800 --> 57:26.800
<i>Je t'aime. Je t'adore. Ma petite chérie.</i>

57:35.900 --> 57:36.900
George.

57:50.800 --> 57:52.500
Get out of here!

57:58.200 --> 58:00.400
What are you looking for now?

58:01.100 --> 58:02.700
Garden lanterns.

58:03.600 --> 58:08.100
You must be pretty brave to ride
on a tiger in your underpants.

58:08.500 --> 58:10.800
Put that away. That's not for kids!

59:11.300 --> 59:12.300
Martha.

59:12.800 --> 59:15.300
Where are the G.D. Garden lanterns?

59:42.300 --> 59:44.600
I think I better go outside and play.

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:05.700
Hello.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.500
Hello, Martha.

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.700
It's Alice.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.200
I'm still in Oklahoma.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.900
Oh, dear.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.400
<i>Yes, there's a terrible storm.</i>

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.700
<i>My flight's been cancelled.</i>

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:20.500
Till the weather clears,
I don't know what's going to happen.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.000
<i>I know your garden party's tonight.</i>
<i>I feel terrible.</i>

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.300
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:31.100
Don't worry about it.
You get home when you can.

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.500
We'll be just fine here.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.200
What's George going to say?

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.700
Over my dead body!

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.700
This is my crowning moment of retired life
and I won't throw it away like the trash...

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.400
...for a ninny who can't get her keister
to the airport on time.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.400
George Wilson,
you have no right to insult Alice.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.500
She can't help the weather,
any more than you or I.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.200
It's just plain bad luck.

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.000
It's no one's fault.

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:02.800
A tragedy of this magnitude
has to be somebody's fault.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.600
It isn't a tragedy.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.500
A little boy's going to join us for a party.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:12.600
If you want to forsake your neighbors
when they need help, do it alone.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.500
Why is it, when everyone else
feasts on the pleasures of life...

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.000
...I get the indigestion?

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.200
Because you're an old grump.

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.400
We did a pretty good job.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.300
Uh-huh.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.000
Now we can order furniture
and major appliances.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.600
Well, Dennis...

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:41.100
<i>...</i> your mother did not arrive.
- Nope.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.600
This is an important event for me.

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:46.100
I know.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.900
I don't want any nonsense.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.400
You mind whatever manners you have
and don't be a pest.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.500
Okay.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.300
Don't embarrass me.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.400
Okay.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.100
Cheek pinchers.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.700
Look at the cute little boy.

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.800
Are you our little host?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.800
The party's in the back.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.400
Ladies, girls, the party's in the back.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:21.100
Thank you very much.
It's just this way, thank you.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.400
Don't embarrass me.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.600
Attention, everyone.

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.500
Gather over here, please.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.900
Have a seat.
It's time to begin the ceremony.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.700
All right, members, don't be timid.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.200
Move down front. Plenty of seats.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.300
Either side, either side.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.200
'<i>'</i> On behalf of the Garden Club...

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:47.000
'<i>'</i> Selection Committee.

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:50.400
- '<i>'</i> We'd like to present <i>...</i>
- '<i>'</i> George Wilson.'<i>'</i>

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.800
'<i>'</i> With this beautiful <i>...</i>'<i>'</i>

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.800
What does that say?

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.100
'<i>'</i> Plague.'<i>'</i> What does that mean?

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.700
- Here, let me have your glasses.
- No. I <i>...</i>

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:06.900
'<i>'</i> Plaque.'<i>'</i> Come on up, George.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.200
Thank you, everyone. I am honored.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.000
I will cherish this forever.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.000
Forty years ago...

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.400
...when I started this garden,
I planted a seed.

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.000
From that tiny seed...

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:31.100
...grew this grand plant.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.600
Tonight...

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:39.100
...for the first and only time
in its entire life, it will blossom.

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.300
As we await this glorious moment...

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.900
...Martha and I invite you
to have some desert and coffee.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.600
Congratulations.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.600
George, would you bring the coffee?

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.200
George, don't start, George.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:21.400
Could you get somebody
to come and clear this away?

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.300
I made a mistake.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.600
Mr. Wilson!

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.600
Somebody robbed your house.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.500
Forty years down the drain.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.600
You're a pest.

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.000
A menace.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.800
A selfish, spoiled little boy
and I have no use for you.

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.200
You took something from me
that I can never get back.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:22.000
Something that means more to me
than you ever will.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:23.899
You understand?

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:27.600
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to know you.

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.899
Get out of my way.

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.500
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.200
Party's over, everybody. Go on home.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.600
I'm sorry.

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.000
Oh, my God!

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:33.899
Where's Dennis?

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.800
Joey hasn't seen him all night?

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:23.700
Okay.

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:26.300
Well, if he shows up, please call me.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:27.900
'Bye.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.100
- Did you call the Wades?
- Yes.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.100
But that's the last place he'd go.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.400
<i>Don't you ever come back here again.</i>

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.700
<i>He's a menace.</i>

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.500
<i>Turn that off!</i>

01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:59.700
<i>Don't make a pest of yourself</i>
<i>and don't embarrass me.</i>

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:04.600
<i>I don't want to know you.</i>
<i>I don't want to see you.</i>

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.400
<i>Get out of my way.</i>

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.400
These woods are pretty scary at night.

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.900
I'm sure glad I ran into a grownup.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
It'll work out real nice.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.100
- You can be my hostage.
- Cool!

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:34.300
I can only be your hostage till tomorrow.

01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:36.700
I have church in the morning.

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:40.800
You ain't going to church.

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:44.500
You and me are catching the midnight train
out of here.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.600
Really?

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.800
We better stop at my house first.
I have to tell my mom and dad...

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:51.100
...or else they'll worry.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.200
And I must get clean underwear
and my camera...

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.400
...and tell my parents to feed my fish...

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:58.900
...some sun block...

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.300
...and vitamins and stuff to play with
on the train so I don't get bored.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.700
Put a cork in it.
You're giving me a headache.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:06.800
I don't have a cork.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.500
Shut your mouth!

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.700
I can't because my nose is stuffy
because of my allergies.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.700
If I shut my mouth, I can't breathe good.

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.600
Then keep your mouth open, but don't talk!

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.900
Where do you put the cork
when you put a cork in it?

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.800
Didn't I ask you to shut your yap?

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:27.000
What's a yap?

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.300
It's your mouth.

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:32.200
I can't shut my mouth
because my nose is stuffy.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.500
Shut up!

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.100
I have one more question.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.000
What?

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.800
What does a hostage have to do?

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.400
Nothing.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.700
How come you need one?

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.900
In case the cops show up.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:58.900
Do I get to use a gun?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.500
You get to stand in front of me
if the cops use a gun.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.600
I've got a slingshot.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.700
Swell.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.000
I'm a good shot. Want to see?

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.700
Excuse me, mister. Do you want to see?

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.700
Mister, can you watch me for a minute?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.100
I'll tell you when to look.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.400
Look!

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.900
Your fire's getting puny.

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:49.100
When my dad's fire gets puny,
he wiggles it around and it gets bigger.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.200
Dennis!

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.900
Dennis!

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:55.200
I'm sorry
you're not having a very fun camping trip.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:00.200
Nobody shoots a marble at my head...

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.200
...and sets my pants on fire.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.000
That was an accident.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.900
There ain't going to be no more accidents!

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.000
Turn around!

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.000
You're doing it wrong.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.400
Get lost.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.400
I tied up lots of guys in my life.

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.100
I bet you've never tied up a 5-year-old.
I'll just get out.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:33.100
I'll tie it so tight
you won't be able to move.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.500
The rope's too big and my legs are
too small to make it tight enough.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:39.300
There's only one way to do it
and I know because...

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.400
...many people have tried to tie me up
but it doesn't work.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.800
But you try your way.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.600
I'll get out
and you'll just have to keep doing it.

01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:56.200
What do you do differently?

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.900
First, you must tie up each leg by itself.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.500
Then you tie them together.

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:28.100
No matter how much I wiggle,
I can't ever get out.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.900
If you really don't want me to move at all <i>...</i>

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.200
Bend down.

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.000
You can't get out of that at all, right?

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:53.400
Nope.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:58.000
You tie me up like that, no matter
how much I try, I can't ever get out.

01:16:58.300 --> 01:16:59.300
Thanks.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.000
- Now let me loose.
- Okay.

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.700
Get the handcuff key.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.900
- Where is it?
- On my bag.

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.500
What?

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.000
Dennis!

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:43.000
Dennis!

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:56.500
I'm going to kill you.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.900
How? You can't move. Open up.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.900
I ain't hungry!

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.700
It's the only way to get the key.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.600
You can't waste food.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.100
Plus, you must eat your dinner.

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.300
Come on.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.000
Come on.

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:18.100
It's coming.

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:28.300
Too hot?

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.700
You must have swallowed it.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I swallowed my allowance once.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.400
I had to wait a whole night and a day
to get it back.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:09.300
Dennis!

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.000
Firewood. Bombs away!

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.400
Poor little lamb.

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:25.100
He must be exhausted.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:29.300
I better cover him up
so he doesn't catch his death of cold.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.800
There we go.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.600
What's he got a purse for?

01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:58.500
Holy smokes!

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.200
He's rich!

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:16.400
Don't worry, I got it!

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.800
I got it! I got it!

01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:05.600
Dennis!

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.800
I've lost the only man I ever loved.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.300
I'll get you out of there.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.300
You shouldn't jump in a river
with handcuffs on, for God's sake!

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.800
You could drown.

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.200
Hold on. I'm coming.

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:46.500
Hey, mister!

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:50.800
Good thing I know a lot about ropes, huh?

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:57.400
That's my boy!

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:00.200
Mr. Wilson taught me how to tie knots.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:04.300
When I get you out, I'm going to bed.
I'm beat.

01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:07.400
It must be all the fresh air.

01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:12.400
Hold on, I'm coming.

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:26.000
There you go. Now just pull yourself in.

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.300
This is Mr. Wilson's gold.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.300
- How come you got it?
- I stole it.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.200
You're a robber?

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:23.400
I'm a thief.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.200
Say your prayers, little rat!

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.700
I can't. I didn't take my bath yet.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.600
Have it your own way.

01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:47.500
Martha!

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:48.800
Mitchell!

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.700
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.400
- Guess what?
- What?

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:27.100
I got your gold back.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Dennis!

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.000
Mom! Dad!

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:40.100
Oh, sweetheart! Thank God, you're okay.

01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:54.100
Help.

01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:16.700
This is my buddy. This is my pal.

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:28.800
Wait a minute.

01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:33.000
You can tell everybody at the big house
you met our Dennis Mitchell.

01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:37.400
All right. Let's wrap it up.

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:42.400
Mister.

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:46.200
You forgot something.

01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:52.300
Dennis!

01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:20.400
I like that rhubarb pie that Martha makes.

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:23.200
- Wonderful dinner.
- Thank you, Henry.

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.400
Alice, your coffee.

01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:29.400
Guess what?

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:31.200
I won't have to travel anymore.

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:32.700
That's nice.

01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:35.200
They want me to work on the project here.

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.800
They agreed to start a daycare center
so I can take Dennis with me to work.

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:40.600
That's ridiculous!

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:43.700
What the heck's he going to do all day?

01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:45.300
Don't be foolish.

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:48.500
We're right next door. We can watch him.

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:52.100
Well, of course. We'd love to.

01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:54.400
I don't think <i>...</i>

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:59.000
I mean, you must remember back
to all the times Dennis upset you.

01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:03.000
This is a new ball game.
I've learned a few things.

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:04.300
Kids are kids.

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:07.700
You have to play by their rules.

01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:10.600
If you can't do that, you're in trouble.

01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:12.700
You must roll with the punches.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.100
You must expect the unexpected.

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.000
Aren't you supposed to be
in the daycare area with the other children?

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.400
That's where I was, but I had to leave.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.500
The lady who watches the kids said...

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.700
...if she had to look at me
for five more seconds...

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.600
...she'd jump out the window.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.300
She's a pretty nice lady...

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.500
...so I wouldn't want her to do that.

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.400
Can I push the button?

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:08.100
No, because you don't know
which button to push.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.600
It's this one!

01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:34.900
I'm going to get this little kid!

01:32:35.305 --> 01:32:41.773
