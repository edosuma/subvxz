01:27.220 --> 01:30.060
<i>Dearest, I feel certain</i>

01:30.100 --> 01:31.900
<i>that I am going mad again.</i>

01:31.980 --> 01:33.260
<i>I feel we can't go</i>

01:33.340 --> 01:35.300
<i>through another
of these terrible times,</i>

01:35.340 --> 01:37.460
<i>and I... shan't</i>

01:37.540 --> 01:40.740
<i>recover this time.</i>

01:40.780 --> 01:45.100
<i>I begin to hear voices,
and can't concentrate.</i>

01:48.300 --> 01:50.140
<i>So, I am doing
what seems to be</i>

01:50.220 --> 01:52.100
<i>the best thing to do.</i>

02:07.540 --> 02:09.060
<i>You have given me</i>

02:09.100 --> 02:11.860
<i>the greatest possible
happiness.</i>

02:11.940 --> 02:14.340
<i>You have been in every way</i>

02:14.420 --> 02:16.620
<i>all that anyone could be.</i>

02:20.140 --> 02:23.140
<i>I know
that I am spoiling your life,</i>

02:23.180 --> 02:25.780
<i>and without me,
you could work.</i>

02:25.860 --> 02:27.820
<i>And you will,</i>

02:27.900 --> 02:29.700
<i>I know.</i>

02:32.420 --> 02:35.940
<i>You see, I can't
even write this properly.</i>

02:38.460 --> 02:40.780
<i>What I want to say
is that I owe</i>

02:40.820 --> 02:43.420
<i>all the happiness
of my life to you.</i>

02:43.500 --> 02:46.340
<i>You have been entirely patient
with me...</i>

02:47.980 --> 02:49.700
<i>and</i>

02:49.740 --> 02:52.420
<i>incredibly good.</i>

02:52.460 --> 02:53.700
<i>Everything's gone</i>

02:53.740 --> 02:56.340
<i>from me but the certainty</i>

02:56.420 --> 02:58.860
<i>of your goodness.</i>

02:58.940 --> 03:01.660
<i>I can't go on
spoiling your life any longer.</i>

03:03.940 --> 03:07.380
<i>I don't think two people
could have been happier</i>

03:07.460 --> 03:09.820
<i>than we have been.</i>

03:09.900 --> 03:11.380
<i>Virginia.</i>

05:03.340 --> 05:04.580
Good morning, Doctor.

05:04.660 --> 05:06.020
Mr. Woolf.

05:06.060 --> 05:08.140
No worse, I think.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.060
I see.

05:10.140 --> 05:14.060
The main thing is to keep her
where she is, and calm.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.340
Friday, then.

08:39.340 --> 08:40.500
Good morning, Leonard.

08:40.580 --> 08:41.780
Good morning, Virginia.

08:41.860 --> 08:43.140
How was your sleep ?

08:43.220 --> 08:44.740
Uneventful.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.460
The headaches ?

08:46.540 --> 08:50.220
No. No headaches.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.620
Doctor seemed pleased.

08:51.660 --> 08:54.220
That's all from this morning ?

08:54.300 --> 08:56.620
Yes. This young man
has submitted his manuscript.

08:56.660 --> 08:58.180
I've found three errors of fact

08:58.220 --> 09:00.100
and two spelling mistakes,

09:00.140 --> 09:02.580
and I'm not yet on page four.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.580
Have you had breakfast ?

09:04.660 --> 09:05.660
Yes.

09:05.740 --> 09:06.820
Liar.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.820
Virginia, it's not
my insistence.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.140
It's your own doctor's.

09:11.220 --> 09:13.740
I'm going to send

09:13.820 --> 09:17.100
Nelly up with some fruit
and a bun.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.820
Right. Lunch, then.

09:18.860 --> 09:19.820
Proper lunch,

09:19.900 --> 09:22.460
husband and wife
sitting down together...

09:22.540 --> 09:23.780
soup, pudding

09:23.820 --> 09:25.540
and all.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.820
By force if necessary.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.940
Leonard, I believe
I may have a first sentence.

09:37.020 --> 09:39.180
Work, then.

09:45.740 --> 09:47.660
Then you must eat.

10:43.140 --> 10:46.180
Mrs. Dalloway said...

10:46.260 --> 10:52.420
she would buy the flowers...
herself.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.660
<i>Mrs. Dalloway said</i>

10:53.740 --> 10:56.860
<i>she would buy the flowers
herself.</i>

10:58.540 --> 11:01.540
Sally, I think I'll buy
the flowers myself.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.660
What ?

11:03.820 --> 11:05.740
What flowers ?

11:05.820 --> 11:08.420
Oh, shit. I forgot.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.140
You're never going
to be a big boy

11:11.220 --> 11:13.260
if you don't eat
your breakfast.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.660
You're going to be
the big brother.

11:14.740 --> 11:15.740
It's a very important job.

11:15.820 --> 11:16.900
Happy birthday.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.580
- Morning, honey.
- Oh, Dan.

11:19.660 --> 11:21.140
Roses on your own birthday.

11:21.220 --> 11:22.500
You're too much.
Really.

11:22.580 --> 11:23.980
He'll eat it

11:24.020 --> 11:25.060
now that you're here.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.300
It's your birthday.

11:27.340 --> 11:28.900
You shouldn't be out
buying me flowers.

11:28.940 --> 11:30.500
Well, you were still sleeping.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.180
So ?

11:32.260 --> 11:34.100
Well, we decided
it would be better

11:34.180 --> 11:35.980
if we let you sleep in
a little, didn't we ?

11:36.060 --> 11:37.220
Morning, bug.

11:40.780 --> 11:42.020
You need to rest, Laura.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.620
You're only four months away.

11:43.700 --> 11:44.740
Dan, don't.

11:44.780 --> 11:46.220
I'm fine.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.140
I'm just tired.

11:49.420 --> 11:51.380
I've been telling him
he's got to eat his breakfast.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.580
That's true.

11:52.620 --> 11:54.300
So, it's a beautiful day.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.620
What are you two going
to be doing with it ?

11:56.700 --> 12:00.180
We've got our plans,
don't we ?

12:00.260 --> 12:01.380
What plans ?

12:01.420 --> 12:02.700
Hmm...

12:02.780 --> 12:05.300
Well, it wouldn't
be much of a party,

12:05.380 --> 12:06.300
would it, if I told you

12:06.380 --> 12:07.380
every detail in advance ?

12:07.460 --> 12:08.580
Well, I better just stop

12:08.620 --> 12:10.180
asking questions then, huh ?

12:10.220 --> 12:12.380
That the time ?

12:12.460 --> 12:13.700
I better get going.

12:13.740 --> 12:14.660
Have a good day.

12:14.780 --> 12:15.740
You, too.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.780
Dan, happy birthday.

12:20.860 --> 12:21.940
Oh, thank you.

12:54.660 --> 12:56.300
You need to finish
your breakfast.

13:21.340 --> 13:22.980
Oh, I'm going to make a cake.

13:25.540 --> 13:28.100
That's what I'm going to do.

13:28.180 --> 13:30.100
I'm going to make the cake
for Daddy's birthday.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.660
Mommy, can I help ?

13:32.620 --> 13:34.020
Can I help make the cake ?

13:35.540 --> 13:37.100
Of course you can, sweet pea.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.460
I'm not going to do
anything without you.

13:40.580 --> 13:41.500
No, of course.

13:41.580 --> 13:43.220
You have to come.

13:43.300 --> 13:46.380
Of course.

13:46.460 --> 13:47.460
Well, I always wanted you

13:47.500 --> 13:49.420
and everybody involved
in the actual ceremony.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.140
I don't know.

13:51.180 --> 13:52.540
Around 60.

13:52.620 --> 13:53.940
Well, it will.

13:54.020 --> 13:55.780
It'll mean so much.

13:55.860 --> 13:57.060
The whole occasion.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.060
It's the least I can do

13:59.140 --> 14:01.060
to have a nice dinner
and say thank you

14:01.100 --> 14:02.180
to everybody.

14:02.220 --> 14:03.780
You've done so much for him.

14:03.860 --> 14:05.260
Oh, I take that as a yes.

14:05.340 --> 14:06.820
He'll be thrilled.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.100
Oh, my God.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.180
I'm thrilled.
Oh, good.

14:11.260 --> 14:12.580
What if nobody comes ?

14:12.620 --> 14:14.260
This is Clarissa Vaughan.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.540
Yes, I am just confirming

14:16.620 --> 14:18.820
that you're sending a car
to pick me up first.

14:18.860 --> 14:20.140
Yeah.

14:20.220 --> 14:21.740
- Hi, Clarissa.
- Hi, can't talk.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.340
And then we're
going over to 679 Hudson,

14:24.420 --> 14:26.220
which is at 9th and 14th.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.780
Then you will take me uptown
and you will wait for us.

14:29.860 --> 14:31.380
And it'll be over at seven.

14:39.220 --> 14:43.020
Flowers !
What a beautiful morning.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.940
Hi, Clarissa.
How are you ?

14:45.900 --> 14:47.340
I'm having a party.

14:47.380 --> 14:50.260
My friend Richard's won
the Carruthers.

14:50.340 --> 14:51.660
Well, that's just terrific...

14:52.580 --> 14:54.140
if I knew what it was.

14:54.220 --> 14:57.740
It's a poetry prize
for a life's work.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.540
It's the most prestigious.

15:00.620 --> 15:01.980
For a poet,
it's the best you can do.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.220
Oh, very good.

15:03.300 --> 15:04.980
So, what would you like ?

15:05.060 --> 15:06.820
The lilies are perfect.

15:06.860 --> 15:09.860
No. Too morbid.

15:09.900 --> 15:10.940
Hydrangeas, I think.

15:11.020 --> 15:12.380
And, um...

15:12.460 --> 15:16.340
Oh, oh, let's just have
buckets of roses.

15:18.660 --> 15:22.700
And... I think I'm going
to take these with me.

15:22.780 --> 15:23.500
Rodney ?

15:23.620 --> 15:24.980
Okay.

15:25.060 --> 15:25.980
Thank you.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.340
I actually tried
to read Richard's novel.

15:31.340 --> 15:33.220
You did ?

15:34.380 --> 15:36.940
Oh, I know. It's not easy.

15:37.060 --> 15:38.100
I know.

15:38.180 --> 15:40.540
It did take him
ten years to write.

15:40.620 --> 15:43.460
Maybe it just takes
another ten to read.

15:46.060 --> 15:47.180
It's you, isn't it ?

15:47.260 --> 15:48.580
What is ?

15:48.620 --> 15:50.060
In the novel,
isn't it meant to be you ?

15:50.140 --> 15:52.740
Oh, I see.

15:52.780 --> 15:54.220
Yeah.

15:54.340 --> 15:55.660
Sort of.

15:55.740 --> 15:57.100
I mean, in a way.

15:57.180 --> 15:58.380
You know, Richard's a writer.

15:58.460 --> 15:59.660
That's what he is.

15:59.740 --> 16:01.180
He uses things
which actually happen.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.620
Yeah.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.860
And years ago,
he and I were students.

16:05.940 --> 16:06.980
That's true.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.500
But, you know,
then he changes things.

16:08.580 --> 16:09.340
Oh, sure.

16:09.420 --> 16:11.460
I don't mean in a bad way.

16:15.420 --> 16:19.020
It's more like...
he makes them his own.

16:27.540 --> 16:30.620
A woman's whole life...

16:30.700 --> 16:33.900
in a single day,

16:33.980 --> 16:37.660
just one day...

16:37.740 --> 16:40.500
and in that day,

16:40.580 --> 16:42.460
her whole life.

16:44.060 --> 16:46.180
This is what we need.

16:46.220 --> 16:47.620
Shortening...

17:44.660 --> 17:48.300
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.

17:48.380 --> 17:49.620
Yes, it's me !

17:49.700 --> 17:52.100
Oh... It's me.

17:52.180 --> 17:53.340
Come in.

17:54.820 --> 17:57.940
Richard,
it's a beautiful morning.

17:58.020 --> 18:01.340
How about we let in
a little more light ?

18:01.420 --> 18:03.100
Is it still morning ?

18:03.180 --> 18:04.980
Yes, it is.

18:05.060 --> 18:07.140
Have I died ?

18:08.940 --> 18:11.180
Good morning, my dear.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.060
Any visitors ?

18:15.140 --> 18:16.060
Yes.

18:16.140 --> 18:17.220
Are they still here ?

18:17.260 --> 18:18.700
No. They've gone.

18:18.780 --> 18:20.540
Mm. How'd they look ?

18:20.620 --> 18:22.500
Today ?

18:22.580 --> 18:24.540
Sort of like black fire.

18:25.820 --> 18:26.900
I mean, sort of light

18:26.980 --> 18:30.300
and dark at the same time.

18:30.380 --> 18:32.500
There was one a bit
like an electrified jellyfish.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.820
They were singing.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.340
May have been Greek.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.300
So the ceremony is at 5:00.

18:41.380 --> 18:42.580
Do you remember ?

18:48.420 --> 18:49.820
And then...

18:49.900 --> 18:52.180
the party is right after.

19:01.180 --> 19:02.700
They did bring you breakfast,
didn't they ?

19:02.780 --> 19:05.420
What a question. Of course.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.460
Richard, you did eat it ?

19:06.540 --> 19:07.820
Well, can you see it ?

19:07.900 --> 19:09.980
Is it here ?

19:10.060 --> 19:10.980
Any breakfast lying around ?

19:11.060 --> 19:13.300
No, I don't see it.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.060
Well, then I must have
eaten it, mustn't I ?

19:15.140 --> 19:17.420
I suppose.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.500
Does it matter ?

19:20.140 --> 19:21.380
Of course, it matters.

19:21.420 --> 19:24.700
You know what the doctors say.

19:30.660 --> 19:33.500
Have you been skipping pills ?

19:33.580 --> 19:34.820
Clarissa, I can't take this.

19:34.900 --> 19:35.780
Take what ?

19:35.860 --> 19:37.060
Having to be proud and brave

19:37.140 --> 19:38.500
in front of everybody.

19:38.540 --> 19:40.580
Oh. Honey, it's not
a performance.

19:40.700 --> 19:41.660
Of course it is.

19:41.740 --> 19:43.860
I got the prize
for my performance.

19:43.940 --> 19:44.860
Well, that is
nonsense.

19:44.940 --> 19:46.980
I got the prize for having AIDS
and going nuts

19:47.060 --> 19:48.180
and being brave about it.

19:48.260 --> 19:50.500
I actually got the prize
for having come through.

19:50.540 --> 19:52.260
It's not true.

19:52.340 --> 19:53.820
- For surviving, that's what
- It's not true.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.300
I got the prize for.
Oh, you think they

19:55.380 --> 19:56.420
would have given it to me
if I were healthy ?

19:56.460 --> 19:58.380
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

20:06.060 --> 20:07.980
Is it here somewhere ?

20:08.060 --> 20:08.940
What ?

20:09.020 --> 20:10.380
The prize.
I'd like to look at it.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.660
No, you haven't gotten it yet.

20:18.540 --> 20:20.260
It's tonight.

20:20.340 --> 20:21.820
Are you sure ?

20:21.900 --> 20:23.980
Um...

20:24.060 --> 20:26.180
I remember
the ceremony perfectly.

20:27.180 --> 20:29.660
I seem to have
fallen out of time.

20:34.140 --> 20:35.180
Richard.

20:35.260 --> 20:37.860
Richard...

20:37.900 --> 20:39.580
it's a party,

20:39.660 --> 20:41.860
and it's only a party.

20:43.100 --> 20:45.020
Hmm ? Populated entirely

20:45.100 --> 20:48.700
by people who respect
and admire you.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.220
A small party, is it ?

20:50.300 --> 20:51.860
A select party, is it ?

20:51.940 --> 20:53.340
Your friends.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.180
I thought I lost all my friends.

20:55.260 --> 20:57.260
I thought I drove
my friends crazy.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.260
Jesus.

20:59.340 --> 21:01.460
Oh, Mrs. Dalloway,

21:01.540 --> 21:05.940
always giving parties
to cover the silence.

21:17.540 --> 21:18.740
Richard...

21:22.340 --> 21:24.260
You won't need to do anything.

21:24.340 --> 21:26.220
All you have to do is appear,

21:26.300 --> 21:29.260
sit on the sofa.

21:30.860 --> 21:32.820
And I will be there.

21:34.540 --> 21:36.220
This is a group of people

21:36.300 --> 21:39.940
who want to tell you
your work is going to live.

21:39.980 --> 21:41.140
Oh, is it ?

21:41.220 --> 21:44.060
Is my work going to live ?

21:44.140 --> 21:46.220
I can't go through with it,
Clarissa.

21:46.380 --> 21:49.260
Oh... Why do you say that ?

21:49.340 --> 21:50.860
- I can't.
- Why ?

21:50.940 --> 21:52.500
Because I wanted
to be a writer, that's all.

21:52.580 --> 21:53.460
So ?

21:53.540 --> 21:56.300
I wanted to write about it all.

21:56.340 --> 21:58.380
Everything that happens
in a moment.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.420
The way the flowers looked

22:00.460 --> 22:02.140
when you carried them
in your arms.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.420
This towel, how it... smells,
how it feels.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.540
This thread.

22:05.580 --> 22:08.100
All our feelings,

22:08.140 --> 22:09.860
yours and mine.

22:09.940 --> 22:10.860
The history of it,

22:10.940 --> 22:13.500
who we once were.

22:13.580 --> 22:15.260
Everything in the world.

22:16.540 --> 22:19.660
Everything all mixed up...

22:19.740 --> 22:22.420
like it's all mixed up now.

22:26.020 --> 22:27.940
And I failed.

22:33.740 --> 22:36.820
I failed.

22:36.900 --> 22:40.580
No matter what you start with,
it ends up being so much less.

22:45.020 --> 22:46.860
Sheer fucking pride...

22:46.900 --> 22:48.460
and stupidity.

22:55.980 --> 22:59.100
We want everything, don't we ?

23:02.660 --> 23:03.540
I suppose we do.

23:03.620 --> 23:06.660
You kissed me on a beach.

23:11.500 --> 23:12.380
Yeah.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.180
Do you remember...

23:16.500 --> 23:18.660
how many years ago ?

23:18.740 --> 23:19.860
Of course.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.140
What did you want then ?

23:28.420 --> 23:30.140
Come closer.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.620
I'm right here.

23:33.740 --> 23:35.780
Come closer, would you, please ?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.100
Take my hand.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.580
Would you be angry ?

23:51.740 --> 23:53.860
Would I be angry
if you didn't show up

23:53.940 --> 23:55.140
at the party ?

23:55.180 --> 23:58.380
Would you be angry if I died ?

23:58.460 --> 23:59.620
If you died ?

23:59.700 --> 24:01.940
Who is this party for ?

24:02.940 --> 24:04.060
What do you mean, who's it for ?

24:04.140 --> 24:05.900
What are you asking ?
What are you trying to say ?

24:05.980 --> 24:07.620
I'm not trying to say anything.

24:07.700 --> 24:08.740
Mm.

24:08.820 --> 24:10.020
I'm saying...

24:10.140 --> 24:15.020
I think I'm only staying alive
to satisfy you.

24:22.980 --> 24:24.980
Well...

24:25.060 --> 24:27.620
so that is what we do.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.380
That is what people do.

24:29.460 --> 24:33.060
They stay alive for each other.

24:33.100 --> 24:34.060
And the doctors told you,

24:34.100 --> 24:35.500
you-you don't need to die.

24:35.540 --> 24:36.460
They told you that.

24:37.540 --> 24:39.900
You can... live
like this for years.

24:39.980 --> 24:41.700
Well, exactly.

24:44.660 --> 24:45.580
I don't accept this.

24:46.700 --> 24:48.420
I don't accept what you say.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.420
Oh.

24:49.460 --> 24:51.660
And it's for you
to decide, is it ?

24:52.500 --> 24:54.100
How long have you been
doing that ?

24:55.340 --> 24:56.300
How many years ?

24:56.340 --> 24:57.580
Coming to the apartment.

24:57.660 --> 25:00.500
What about your own life ?

25:00.580 --> 25:03.100
What about Sally ?

25:04.380 --> 25:06.340
Just wait till I die.

25:06.420 --> 25:07.740
Then you'll have to think
of yourself.

25:09.220 --> 25:10.940
How are you going to like that ?

25:18.740 --> 25:20.460
Richard...

25:22.900 --> 25:25.660
it would be great
if you did come to the party,

25:25.740 --> 25:28.100
if you felt
well enough to come.

25:28.180 --> 25:29.300
Just to let you know,

25:29.380 --> 25:32.340
I am making the crab thing.

25:32.420 --> 25:35.260
Not that I imagine
it makes any difference to you.

25:35.340 --> 25:36.900
Of course,
it makes a difference.

25:36.980 --> 25:38.140
I love the crab thing.

25:39.860 --> 25:42.060
Clarissa ?

25:43.140 --> 25:44.180
Yes ?

25:58.220 --> 26:00.260
I'll be back at 3:30,

26:00.300 --> 26:01.740
and I'll help you
get dressed.

26:01.820 --> 26:03.940
Wonderful.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.980
3:30.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.540
Wonderful.

26:42.620 --> 26:45.820
<i>It's on this day,</i>

26:45.900 --> 26:47.980
<i>this day of all days...</i>

26:56.980 --> 26:58.820
<i>her fate becomes clear
to her.</i>

27:05.380 --> 27:06.700
Excuse me, Mrs. Woolf.

27:06.780 --> 27:09.020
Mr. Woolf said I was to come
and speak with you.

27:10.660 --> 27:12.340
I've nearly finished, Nelly.

27:12.420 --> 27:14.300
You can tell me in the kitchen.

27:14.380 --> 27:15.820
I'll be down very soon.

27:20.420 --> 27:22.660
Hmm.

27:23.780 --> 27:25.980
What happens is,
she says she wants something,

27:26.060 --> 27:27.460
and then it turns out
she doesn't.

27:27.540 --> 27:29.140
Well, she never does, does she ?

27:29.220 --> 27:30.140
She never wants anything.

27:30.220 --> 27:31.140
Mm-hmm.

27:31.180 --> 27:33.380
Especially when she's
particularly after it.

27:33.420 --> 27:34.340
That's a sure sign.

27:34.460 --> 27:35.540
I wish I'd been there.

27:35.620 --> 27:36.900
I wish you had, too.

27:36.980 --> 27:39.060
Did you give her that look ?

27:39.140 --> 27:40.140
That sort of look you do ?

27:42.620 --> 27:44.340
<i>I said, Madam...</i>

27:50.540 --> 27:52.700
Yes, Nelly, tell me.

27:52.780 --> 27:53.860
How can I help ?

27:53.900 --> 27:55.180
It's about lunch.

27:55.260 --> 27:58.500
I just had
to go ahead on my own.

27:58.540 --> 28:00.260
I understand.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.860
You chose a pie ?

28:04.940 --> 28:06.580
I chose a lamb pie.

28:06.660 --> 28:08.780
That seems suitable.

28:08.860 --> 28:12.180
You being so busy
with your writing...

28:12.260 --> 28:16.500
I had no instructions.

28:17.620 --> 28:19.980
You do remember
that my sister is coming

28:20.020 --> 28:21.580
at 4:00 with the children ?

28:21.660 --> 28:22.780
Yes, ma'am.

28:22.860 --> 28:24.740
I hadn't forgotten.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.260
China tea, I think.

28:31.020 --> 28:33.020
And ginger.

28:35.700 --> 28:37.060
Ginger, Madam ?

28:39.220 --> 28:42.700
I'd like
to give the children a treat.

28:45.300 --> 28:46.860
We'd have to go to London

28:46.940 --> 28:47.820
for ginger, Madam.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.140
I haven't finished this,

28:49.260 --> 28:51.060
and there's the rest
of lunch

28:51.180 --> 28:52.500
to get ready.

28:53.540 --> 28:55.340
The 12:30 train, Nelly,
will get you

28:55.420 --> 28:56.900
into London just after 1:00.

28:56.980 --> 28:58.380
If you return on the 2:30,

28:58.420 --> 29:00.940
you should be back in Richmond
soon after 3:00.

29:02.580 --> 29:03.780
Do I miscalculate ?

29:04.860 --> 29:05.940
No.

29:06.020 --> 29:08.380
Well, then, is something
detaining you, Nelly ?

29:17.100 --> 29:19.140
I can't think of anything
more exhilarating

29:19.180 --> 29:20.300
than a trip to London.

29:27.300 --> 29:28.940
- Good morning, Mrs. Woolf.
- Good morning.

29:29.020 --> 29:31.860
We shall publish
no more new authors.

29:31.940 --> 29:32.940
I have to tell you,

29:33.020 --> 29:34.700
I've discovered ten errors
in the first proof.

29:34.780 --> 29:36.300
Lucky to have found them then.

29:36.380 --> 29:38.940
<i>Passiondale was a...</i>

29:39.020 --> 29:40.100
<i>charnel house</i>

29:40.180 --> 29:42.700
<i>from which no min returned.</i>

29:44.340 --> 29:46.140
Do you think it's possible that

29:46.220 --> 29:47.820
bad writing actually
attracts a higher

29:47.900 --> 29:48.700
incidence of error ?

29:50.580 --> 29:53.420
If it's all right, I thought
I might take a short walk.

29:54.940 --> 29:56.260
Not far ?

29:56.300 --> 29:57.740
No. Just for air.

30:00.460 --> 30:01.540
Go then.

30:02.540 --> 30:04.620
If I could walk midmorning,

30:04.700 --> 30:06.020
I'd be a happy man.

30:16.020 --> 30:17.740
She'll die.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.100
She's going to die.

30:23.460 --> 30:26.020
That's what's going to happen.

30:26.180 --> 30:27.540
Huh.

30:27.620 --> 30:29.140
That's it.

30:35.260 --> 30:36.740
She'll kill herself.

30:39.740 --> 30:41.700
She'll kill herself
over something

30:41.780 --> 30:43.540
which doesn't seem to matter.

30:43.620 --> 30:46.060
Let's think.

30:46.140 --> 30:47.820
You grease the pan, Mommy.

30:47.900 --> 30:49.900
I know you grease the pan,
sweet one.

30:49.980 --> 30:51.220
Even Mommy knows that.

30:53.580 --> 30:55.820
This is what we're going to do.

30:56.860 --> 30:57.980
Flour...

30:58.060 --> 31:00.340
bowl...

31:00.420 --> 31:01.500
sifter.

31:01.580 --> 31:02.580
Can I do it, Mommy ?

31:03.620 --> 31:05.140
Can you sift the flour ?

31:06.620 --> 31:08.220
Yes, you can sift the flour,
baby,

31:08.340 --> 31:09.940
if that's what makes you happy.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.900
Yeah.

31:20.460 --> 31:22.700
Isn't it beautiful ?

31:22.780 --> 31:25.940
Don't you think
it looks like snow ?

31:26.020 --> 31:26.900
Hmm ?

31:26.980 --> 31:27.860
Okay.

31:27.940 --> 31:30.180
Now, the next thing...

31:30.220 --> 31:31.820
The next thing I'm going

31:31.900 --> 31:34.900
to show you... uh, is...

31:34.980 --> 31:36.060
we measure out the cups.

31:36.140 --> 31:38.500
Mommy, it isn't that difficult.

31:38.540 --> 31:40.260
Now, I know.
I know it isn't difficult.

31:40.340 --> 31:41.260
It's just that I...

31:41.340 --> 31:43.620
I just want to do this
for Daddy.

31:43.660 --> 31:45.540
Because it's his birthday ?

31:45.580 --> 31:46.500
That's right.

31:46.540 --> 31:47.980
We're baking the cake

31:48.020 --> 31:49.900
to show him
that we love him.

31:49.980 --> 31:52.420
Otherwise he won't know
we love him ?

31:55.340 --> 31:57.620
That's right.

32:06.340 --> 32:07.980
I got all the stuff.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.220
I'm going right out again.

32:10.300 --> 32:11.900
My God, what a zoo !

32:11.980 --> 32:14.580
Why do people have to talk
about dry cleaning ?

32:14.660 --> 32:16.700
I mean, what is there
to talk about ?

32:16.780 --> 32:18.340
I bought you some flowers.

32:20.540 --> 32:21.740
Where are you ?

32:21.820 --> 32:23.460
In here.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.820
I got someone at work
to cover me.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.980
I'll be with you all night.

32:35.060 --> 32:36.340
Are you all right ?

32:36.420 --> 32:38.220
Sure.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.700
I guess you saw Richard.

32:43.780 --> 32:45.020
That's right.

32:47.660 --> 32:49.340
Well, of course.

32:50.380 --> 32:51.260
I bet he said,

32:51.340 --> 32:52.900
<i>Oh, by the way,
honey, do you mind ?</i>

32:52.980 --> 32:54.020
<i>Can I skip the party ?</i>

32:56.060 --> 32:57.220
Don't worry.

32:57.260 --> 32:58.860
He always shows up.

32:58.940 --> 32:59.940
Oh, sure.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.060
In the end.

33:01.100 --> 33:02.820
What, Richard miss an award ?

33:02.900 --> 33:04.940
A chance to talk about his work.

33:05.020 --> 33:06.340
I don't think so.

33:06.380 --> 33:07.460
He'll show up.

33:07.540 --> 33:09.180
You did the seating.

33:10.740 --> 33:11.980
I did.

33:14.100 --> 33:15.780
I don't believe it...
Louis Waters.

33:15.900 --> 33:18.020
Is Louis coming ?

33:18.100 --> 33:19.140
Richard's Louis ?

33:19.180 --> 33:20.500
He is.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.500
You put him next to me.

33:24.980 --> 33:26.900
Why do I always have
to sit next to the exes ?

33:26.980 --> 33:28.740
Is this some kind of a hint,
sweetheart ?

33:28.820 --> 33:31.140
And, anyway, shouldn't
the exes have a table

33:31.260 --> 33:34.500
of their own,
where they can all ex together

33:34.540 --> 33:35.980
in ex-quisite agony ?

33:38.540 --> 33:39.900
I'm off.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.820
Try not to pass out
from excitement.

33:48.340 --> 33:49.540
Clarissa...

33:49.620 --> 33:50.820
it's going to be beautiful.

33:57.220 --> 33:58.900
Thank you.

33:59.020 --> 34:01.740
You're welcome.

34:08.340 --> 34:11.260
Why is everything wrong ?

34:15.659 --> 34:16.780
It didn't work.

34:16.860 --> 34:17.820
Damn it !

34:17.900 --> 34:19.780
It didn't work.

34:22.980 --> 34:24.260
Hey, Scott.

34:24.340 --> 34:26.300
Hi, Mrs. Barlowe.

34:38.940 --> 34:40.460
Mommy, Mommy, there's
someone at the door !

34:48.780 --> 34:50.060
Hello ?

34:51.580 --> 34:53.900
Hello ? Laura ?

34:53.980 --> 34:54.940
Hi, Kitty.

34:55.020 --> 34:56.100
Hi. Am I interrupting ?

34:56.179 --> 34:57.700
Oh, of course not. Come in.

34:57.780 --> 34:58.820
Are you all right ?

34:58.900 --> 35:00.380
Why, sure.

35:01.420 --> 35:02.500
Hi, Richie.

35:02.580 --> 35:03.620
Sit down.

35:03.660 --> 35:05.060
I've got coffee on.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.820
Um, would you like some ?

35:06.860 --> 35:07.940
Please.

35:08.020 --> 35:09.220
Oh, look.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.460
You made a cake.

35:11.540 --> 35:12.740
I know.

35:12.780 --> 35:13.860
Didn't work.

35:13.900 --> 35:16.420
I thought it was going to work.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.860
I thought
it would work better than that.

35:19.940 --> 35:20.940
Oh, Laura, I don't understand

35:21.020 --> 35:22.020
why you find it so difficult.

35:22.100 --> 35:23.060
I don't know either.

35:23.140 --> 35:24.260
Anyone can make a cake.

35:24.340 --> 35:25.220
I know.

35:25.300 --> 35:26.300
Everyone can.

35:26.380 --> 35:27.940
It's ridiculously easy.

35:29.140 --> 35:30.940
Like, I bet you didn't
even grease the pan.

35:31.020 --> 35:32.580
I greased the pan.

35:32.660 --> 35:33.620
All right.

35:33.700 --> 35:34.740
You know, you have

35:34.820 --> 35:37.020
other virtues... and
Dan loves you so much,

35:37.100 --> 35:38.300
he won't even notice.

35:38.380 --> 35:39.380
Whatever you do,

35:39.460 --> 35:41.700
he's going to say
it's wonderful.

35:41.780 --> 35:42.980
Well, it's true.

35:44.900 --> 35:46.460
Does Ray have a birthday ?

35:48.300 --> 35:49.300
Sure he does.

35:49.380 --> 35:50.340
When is it ?

35:50.420 --> 35:51.500
September.

35:51.580 --> 35:52.940
We go to the country club.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.740
We always go
to the country club.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.540
We drink martinis and spend
the day with 50 people.

35:57.620 --> 35:59.100
Ray's got a lot of friends.

35:59.180 --> 36:01.460
He does.

36:01.540 --> 36:03.020
You both have a lot of friends.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.020
You're good at it.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.180
How is Ray ?

36:08.260 --> 36:10.140
I haven't seen him in a while.

36:10.220 --> 36:11.260
Ray's fine.

36:11.340 --> 36:12.420
Mmm.

36:12.460 --> 36:14.500
These guys are
something, aren't they ?

36:14.540 --> 36:15.780
You can say that again.

36:15.820 --> 36:17.780
They came home from the war.

36:17.860 --> 36:19.980
They deserved it, didn't they ?

36:20.060 --> 36:22.220
After what they'd
been through.

36:22.300 --> 36:23.940
What... did they deserve ?

36:23.980 --> 36:25.140
I don't know.

36:25.220 --> 36:28.140
Us, I guess.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.020
All this.

36:31.540 --> 36:32.660
Oh.

36:32.740 --> 36:34.580
You're reading a book.

36:34.660 --> 36:35.780
Yeah.

36:37.060 --> 36:38.900
What's this one about ?

36:38.980 --> 36:40.180
Oh, it's about...

36:40.260 --> 36:42.860
this woman who's incredibly...

36:42.940 --> 36:46.020
Well, she's a hostess, and
she's incredibly confident,

36:46.100 --> 36:48.140
and she's going to give a party,

36:48.220 --> 36:50.500
and maybe because
she's confident,

36:50.540 --> 36:53.420
everyone thinks she's fine...

36:53.500 --> 36:54.940
but she isn't.

37:03.340 --> 37:05.260
So.

37:06.500 --> 37:07.620
Well.

37:12.460 --> 37:13.740
Kitty, what is it ?

37:13.820 --> 37:15.540
Is something wrong ?

37:17.380 --> 37:19.460
I, uh... I have
to go into the hospital

37:19.500 --> 37:20.660
for a couple of days.

37:20.740 --> 37:22.340
Kitty.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.660
Yeah. I have, um...

37:26.700 --> 37:28.860
some kind of... growth,
in my uterus,

37:28.940 --> 37:31.460
and they're going to go in
and take a look.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.420
When ?

37:32.460 --> 37:34.700
This afternoon.

37:35.900 --> 37:38.020
Well, I need you
to feed the dog.

37:39.820 --> 37:41.060
Of course.

37:58.060 --> 38:00.620
Is that what you
came here to ask ?

38:03.900 --> 38:05.980
What did the doctor
say exactly ?

38:07.660 --> 38:10.180
Well, it's probably
what the trouble's been.

38:10.220 --> 38:12.580
About getting pregnant.

38:13.740 --> 38:16.460
The thing is...

38:16.540 --> 38:17.860
I mean, you know,

38:17.900 --> 38:20.700
I've been...
really happy with Ray.

38:25.260 --> 38:27.340
And now it turns out
there was a reason.

38:30.060 --> 38:32.100
There was a reason
I couldn't conceive.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.020
You're lucky, Laura.

38:38.060 --> 38:40.220
I don't think you
can call yourself a woman

38:40.300 --> 38:41.420
until you're a mother.

38:46.260 --> 38:49.540
The joke is...

38:49.580 --> 38:51.340
all my life
I could do everything.

38:53.620 --> 38:55.860
I mean, I could
do anything, really.

38:58.180 --> 39:00.420
Except the one thing I wanted.

39:00.460 --> 39:02.220
Yes.

39:03.260 --> 39:04.500
That's all.

39:06.060 --> 39:08.140
Well, at least now they'll
be able to deal with it.

39:08.220 --> 39:10.140
That's right.
That's what they're doing.

39:10.220 --> 39:11.180
That's right.

39:11.260 --> 39:12.580
Mm. I'm not worried.

39:12.620 --> 39:15.020
What would be
the point of worrying ?

39:15.100 --> 39:16.940
No, it's not in your hands.

39:17.020 --> 39:18.260
But that's it.

39:18.340 --> 39:22.620
It's in the hands of some
physician I've never even met.

39:22.700 --> 39:26.180
Some surgeon who probably
drinks more martinis

39:26.260 --> 39:27.220
than Ray and...

39:27.300 --> 39:28.220
Oh, Kitty.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.740
I'm mean, of course I'm worried
about Ray.

39:30.860 --> 39:31.580
Come here.

39:31.660 --> 39:32.820
I'm doing fine.

39:32.900 --> 39:33.780
Really.

39:33.860 --> 39:34.860
I know. I know you are.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.180
I'm more worried about Ray.

39:36.260 --> 39:38.340
If anything,
he's not good with this stuff.

39:39.700 --> 39:40.900
Forget about him, hmm ?

39:40.980 --> 39:42.300
Just forget about Ray.

40:04.420 --> 40:05.980
You're sweet.

40:11.780 --> 40:12.940
You know the routine, right ?

40:13.020 --> 40:15.260
Half a can
in the evening, and...

40:15.340 --> 40:17.380
check the water now and then,

40:17.420 --> 40:20.300
and Ray will feed
him in the morning.

40:25.820 --> 40:27.700
Kitty, you didn't mind ?

40:30.140 --> 40:32.580
What ?

40:32.660 --> 40:33.580
I didn't mind what ?

40:42.780 --> 40:44.980
Do you want me to drive you ?

40:49.060 --> 40:51.340
I think I'll feel better
if I drive myself.

40:55.860 --> 40:57.460
Kitty, it's going to be
all right.

41:00.540 --> 41:01.780
Of course it is.

41:05.020 --> 41:06.100
Bye.

41:26.300 --> 41:27.340
What ?

41:27.420 --> 41:28.580
What do you want ?

41:45.500 --> 41:48.260
Mr. Woolf, Mrs. Bell
has arrived.

41:50.660 --> 41:52.300
Not due till 4:00.

41:52.380 --> 41:55.260
I can't help it.
She's here.

42:00.700 --> 42:03.620
You look a perfect angel.

42:03.700 --> 42:05.820
Don't let the boys
make fun of you.

42:05.900 --> 42:07.420
Fly away, fly.

42:10.140 --> 42:12.060
Virginia.

42:13.460 --> 42:16.020
Leonard thinks it's
the end of civilization...

42:16.100 --> 42:18.980
people who are invited
at 4:00 and arrive at 2:30.

42:19.060 --> 42:21.300
Oh, God.

42:22.460 --> 42:23.700
Barbarians.

42:23.780 --> 42:28.420
Well, we finished lunch
sooner than we imagined.

42:31.420 --> 42:34.660
I've had to send Nelly off
to London for sugar ginger.

42:34.740 --> 42:37.180
Oh, Virginia.

42:37.260 --> 42:41.220
You're not still frightened
of the servants, are you ?

42:41.260 --> 42:42.540
Come on.

42:45.860 --> 42:47.260
And how are you, sister ?

42:47.340 --> 42:49.380
Frantic.

42:49.460 --> 42:51.180
It's been ridiculous in London.

42:51.260 --> 42:53.060
Ridiculous ? How ?

42:53.100 --> 42:56.420
Busy.

42:57.780 --> 42:59.420
Why is busy ridiculous ?

42:59.500 --> 43:02.940
I would have invited you
to our party,

43:03.020 --> 43:04.100
but I knew you wouldn't come.

43:04.180 --> 43:05.540
Did you ?
How did you know that ?

43:07.260 --> 43:09.420
I thought
you never came to town.

43:10.820 --> 43:13.100
That's because
you no longer ask me.

43:15.860 --> 43:18.500
Are you not forbidden to come ?

43:18.540 --> 43:21.060
Do the doctors not forbid it ?

43:21.140 --> 43:23.100
Oh, the doctors.

43:24.780 --> 43:26.340
Do you not pay heed
to your doctors ?

43:26.420 --> 43:29.460
Not when they're a bunch
of contemptible Victorians.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.580
So... what are you saying ?

43:32.940 --> 43:35.060
Are you feeling better ?

43:35.140 --> 43:37.540
Has this vastness
made you stronger ?

43:37.620 --> 43:41.380
I'm saying, Vanessa, that even
crazy people like to be asked.

43:41.420 --> 43:42.940
Nessa ! Nessa !

43:43.020 --> 43:44.900
Nessa ! Nessa !

43:45.020 --> 43:47.140
Hello, changelings.

43:47.180 --> 43:48.820
What have you got ?

43:48.900 --> 43:50.020
What have you found ?

43:50.060 --> 43:51.460
We found a bird.

43:51.500 --> 43:53.020
Did you ?

43:53.100 --> 43:54.020
Yes.

43:54.060 --> 43:55.620
Where did you find that ?

43:55.700 --> 43:57.540
I think it must have
fallen from a tree.

43:57.580 --> 43:58.940
Oh, my goodness.

43:59.020 --> 44:00.580
Just look at him.

44:00.660 --> 44:02.820
We might be able to save him.

44:02.860 --> 44:04.300
Save him ?

44:04.380 --> 44:07.380
I think you have
to be careful, Quentin.

44:07.460 --> 44:08.380
There's a time to die,

44:08.460 --> 44:09.700
and it may be
the bird's time.

44:09.780 --> 44:11.620
Come on, let's pick some grass

44:11.700 --> 44:13.180
to make a grave.

44:13.260 --> 44:15.140
- Oh, Julian.
- I'm just saying.

44:15.180 --> 44:16.820
Then at least there'll be
a bed for him to die on.

44:16.900 --> 44:19.940
Come on, Nessa,
let's make a grave.

44:21.580 --> 44:22.940
Nessa, come on !

44:23.020 --> 44:24.180
Oh...

44:24.300 --> 44:25.980
Very well, I'm coming.

44:26.060 --> 44:27.220
Wait for me then.

44:27.300 --> 44:29.780
Angelica, will
you be all right ?

44:29.860 --> 44:30.820
Stay with your aunt.

44:30.900 --> 44:32.940
You're going too fast.

44:51.420 --> 44:52.860
Do you think she'd like roses ?

44:59.980 --> 45:02.180
Is it a she ?

45:03.500 --> 45:05.940
Yes, the females are larger.

45:06.020 --> 45:09.620
And less colorful.

45:09.700 --> 45:12.340
What happens when we die ?

45:12.420 --> 45:14.100
What happens ?

45:19.340 --> 45:22.300
We return to the place
that we came from.

45:22.380 --> 45:25.140
I don't remember
where I came from.

45:25.220 --> 45:26.620
Nor do I.

45:30.700 --> 45:33.180
She looks very small.

45:34.580 --> 45:36.260
Yes.

45:36.340 --> 45:38.820
Yes, that's one
of the things that happens...

45:38.900 --> 45:42.300
we look smaller.

45:42.380 --> 45:45.500
But very peaceful.

45:57.460 --> 45:58.940
Oh, is it done ?

45:59.020 --> 46:01.140
Have we finished ?

46:01.220 --> 46:03.060
Is the bird funeral complete ?

46:03.140 --> 46:04.020
Yes.

46:04.100 --> 46:05.380
Very well, then.

46:05.460 --> 46:08.180
Are we to be denied tea
altogether for coming so early ?

46:08.260 --> 46:09.580
No, of course not.

46:09.660 --> 46:10.740
Good.

46:10.820 --> 46:13.740
Come on, Angelica.

46:13.820 --> 46:15.060
Come on, come on, boys.

46:15.140 --> 46:16.100
Let's get some tea.

46:16.180 --> 46:18.020
Nessa, tell him to stop it !

46:18.100 --> 46:20.220
Now stop it, Julian.

46:26.740 --> 46:30.780
Virginia, we're going in.

46:30.860 --> 46:32.980
Virginia !

47:46.460 --> 47:48.180
Hey, bug.

47:48.260 --> 47:50.300
I've got this idea.

47:50.380 --> 47:52.660
We're going
to make another cake.

47:54.220 --> 47:56.100
We're going to make
a better one.

47:56.140 --> 47:57.620
What happened
to the first one ?

48:01.940 --> 48:04.500
And after that...

48:04.580 --> 48:07.140
I think we should go out.

48:17.460 --> 48:18.700
Yes ?

48:18.780 --> 48:20.860
Clarissa, it's Louis.

48:20.940 --> 48:22.340
Louis Waters.

48:22.380 --> 48:25.140
Louis ? Oh, my God.

48:25.220 --> 48:26.100
You're early.

48:26.180 --> 48:27.100
Do you mind ?

48:27.180 --> 48:28.700
Is it all right ?

48:46.020 --> 48:48.380
Oh, why should I mind ?

48:48.460 --> 48:49.500
I'm delighted !

48:49.580 --> 48:51.060
Well, now !

48:53.900 --> 48:55.700
I feel like I'm interrupting.

48:55.780 --> 48:56.660
Oh, why ?!

48:56.740 --> 48:58.100
No.

48:58.180 --> 48:59.900
I know the ceremony
isn't until 5:00,

48:59.980 --> 49:01.180
but I flew in this morning.

49:01.220 --> 49:06.340
Oh, well, Richard's
going to be thrilled.

49:06.380 --> 49:08.780
He'll be thrilled
to see you.

49:08.860 --> 49:09.780
You think so ?

49:09.860 --> 49:11.300
Of course.

49:17.460 --> 49:19.700
What are we doing ?
We should go in.

49:27.780 --> 49:29.140
Are you all right ?

49:29.220 --> 49:30.780
Yes. It's nothing.

49:30.860 --> 49:32.580
It's just the party.

49:32.660 --> 49:34.100
Oh, right.

49:37.100 --> 49:38.700
Oh, wow !

49:38.780 --> 49:39.660
It's looking beautiful.

49:39.740 --> 49:41.340
Thanks.

49:41.420 --> 49:42.100
Are you still with... ?

49:42.180 --> 49:43.100
Yes, I am.

49:43.180 --> 49:45.020
Still with her. Ten years.

49:46.140 --> 49:46.900
It's crazy.

49:46.980 --> 49:48.940
Why is it crazy ?

49:49.020 --> 49:50.620
No reason.

49:50.700 --> 49:52.140
Would you like something
to drink ?

49:52.220 --> 49:53.780
Some water.

49:53.860 --> 49:54.660
Okay.

50:09.740 --> 50:11.940
Are you still an editor ?

50:12.020 --> 50:14.140
Oh, sure.

50:14.180 --> 50:15.500
With the same publisher ?

50:16.780 --> 50:18.100
Mm-hmm.

50:18.220 --> 50:19.940
How's San Francisco ?

50:20.020 --> 50:23.900
Oh, it's one of those cities
people tell you to like.

50:37.860 --> 50:39.820
Richard said he thought

50:39.900 --> 50:40.900
you were happy out there.

50:40.980 --> 50:41.860
Oh, great.

50:41.940 --> 50:43.820
So now the illness
makes him psychic.

50:46.820 --> 50:48.100
You have to prepare
yourself, Louis.

50:48.140 --> 50:50.380
He's very changed.

50:53.180 --> 50:54.420
I read the book.

50:54.500 --> 50:55.620
Oh, God...

50:55.700 --> 50:57.540
Exactly.

50:57.620 --> 50:59.300
I thought you were
meant to do more

50:59.340 --> 51:00.900
than just change people's names.

51:00.980 --> 51:01.900
Well...

51:01.980 --> 51:04.100
Isn't it meant to be fiction ?

51:04.140 --> 51:05.780
He even had you living

51:05.860 --> 51:07.300
on 10th Street.

51:07.380 --> 51:08.380
It isn't me.

51:08.460 --> 51:09.460
Isn't it ?

51:09.540 --> 51:10.700
You know how Richard is.

51:10.780 --> 51:11.740
It's a fantasy.

51:11.780 --> 51:13.220
A whole chapter on

51:13.260 --> 51:15.940
<i>Should she buy
some nail polish ?</i>

51:15.980 --> 51:17.260
And then, guess what ?

51:17.340 --> 51:19.300
After 50 pages, she doesn't.

51:20.300 --> 51:23.300
The whole thing seems to go on
for eternity.

51:23.460 --> 51:24.260
Nothing happens.

51:24.300 --> 51:25.220
And then, wham !

51:25.380 --> 51:27.620
For no reason,
she kills herself.

51:27.660 --> 51:28.900
His mother

51:28.940 --> 51:29.980
kills herself.

51:30.020 --> 51:31.620
Yeah, sure, his mother,
but still for no reason.

51:31.660 --> 51:33.860
Well, I...

51:34.020 --> 51:34.900
Out of the blue.

51:36.820 --> 51:38.500
I know the book is tough,
but I liked it.

51:39.740 --> 51:40.580
I know.

51:40.700 --> 51:43.980
Only one thing upset me.

51:44.060 --> 51:45.220
What's that ?

51:45.260 --> 51:46.180
What upset you ?

51:48.140 --> 51:49.580
Well...

51:49.660 --> 51:52.460
that there wasn't more
about you.

51:57.060 --> 51:58.660
That's kind.

52:01.420 --> 52:03.180
I went back to Wellfleet.

52:06.500 --> 52:07.380
You did ?

52:07.460 --> 52:08.340
One day.

52:08.420 --> 52:09.460
I didn't tell you ?

52:11.820 --> 52:13.180
No.

52:13.260 --> 52:15.180
But then, I never see you.

52:16.580 --> 52:18.340
You remember the house.

52:18.380 --> 52:20.860
It's still there.

52:20.940 --> 52:21.900
I think you're courageous.

52:21.980 --> 52:24.700
Courageous ? Why ?

52:24.820 --> 52:26.460
To dare go visit.

52:26.540 --> 52:28.660
What I mean is...

52:28.740 --> 52:30.460
to face the fact

52:30.540 --> 52:34.820
that we have lost
those feelings forever.

52:37.700 --> 52:39.020
Shit !

52:39.100 --> 52:40.900
Clarissa ?

52:40.940 --> 52:43.100
Um...

52:43.140 --> 52:45.100
I don't know what's happening.

52:45.180 --> 52:46.060
I'm sorry.

52:46.140 --> 52:47.500
I seem to be in some strange

52:47.580 --> 52:49.020
sort of mood.

52:49.100 --> 52:50.020
I'm sorry.

52:50.060 --> 52:52.860
It's, uh, it's very rude of me.

52:54.900 --> 52:57.140
I seem to be unraveling.

52:57.220 --> 52:58.140
I shouldn't have come.

52:58.220 --> 52:59.180
No, it's not you.

52:59.300 --> 53:00.020
It's not you.

53:01.020 --> 53:02.940
It's more like having
a presentiment.

53:03.020 --> 53:04.500
Do you know what I'm saying ?

53:06.220 --> 53:08.580
Oh, God,
it's probably just nerves

53:08.660 --> 53:10.540
about the party, you know ?

53:10.620 --> 53:13.020
Bad hostess !

53:13.100 --> 53:15.620
Clarissa, what's happened ?

53:15.660 --> 53:17.380
Jesus !

53:17.420 --> 53:19.700
What is it ?!

53:19.780 --> 53:21.140
Oh ! Oh, God !

53:23.020 --> 53:25.980
Do you want me to go ?

53:26.060 --> 53:29.620
No, don't go ! Don't...

53:29.700 --> 53:31.380
Don't go.

53:31.460 --> 53:33.220
Explain to me
why this is happening.

53:35.260 --> 53:37.580
Don't... don't touch me.

53:37.700 --> 53:38.820
Jesus.

53:38.860 --> 53:40.940
It's better if you don't.

53:43.940 --> 53:46.540
It's just too much.

53:46.620 --> 53:49.380
You fly in from San Francisco,

53:49.460 --> 53:52.220
and I've been nursing Richard
for years.

53:52.260 --> 53:55.220
And all the time,
I've held myself together...

53:55.300 --> 53:56.700
no problem.

53:56.860 --> 53:58.180
I know.

54:00.580 --> 54:04.020
One morning, in Wellfleet...

54:04.100 --> 54:08.340
you were there,
we were all there...

54:08.420 --> 54:10.820
I'd been sleeping with him,

54:10.900 --> 54:13.860
and I was out
on the back porch.

54:13.940 --> 54:17.660
He came out behind me,

54:17.740 --> 54:22.380
and he put his hand
on my shoulder.

54:22.460 --> 54:25.100
<i>Good morning, Mrs. Dalloway.</i>

54:28.660 --> 54:30.220
That's...

54:32.340 --> 54:33.940
That's when...

54:34.020 --> 54:36.700
From then on, I've...
been stuck.

54:36.780 --> 54:37.780
Stuck ?

54:37.860 --> 54:39.940
Yep.

54:41.220 --> 54:42.340
Yeah.

54:43.460 --> 54:45.260
With the name, I mean.

54:48.900 --> 54:51.260
And now you walk in.

54:51.340 --> 54:54.420
To see you

54:54.500 --> 54:57.820
walk in...
because I never see you.

54:57.900 --> 55:00.220
Look at you.

55:02.180 --> 55:06.500
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

55:06.580 --> 55:08.420
It was you he stayed with.

55:08.460 --> 55:09.420
It was you he lived with.

55:09.500 --> 55:12.460
I had one summer.

55:23.540 --> 55:25.820
The day I left him,

55:25.900 --> 55:32.260
I got on a train
and made my way across Europe.

55:32.340 --> 55:36.740
I felt free
for the first time in years.

55:51.900 --> 55:55.580
So... tell me about
San Francisco.

55:55.660 --> 55:56.860
What's to tell ?

55:56.900 --> 56:00.420
I still teach drama
to idiots, mostly.

56:00.540 --> 56:01.980
They can't all be idiots.

56:02.020 --> 56:04.140
No, no. In fact,

56:04.220 --> 56:07.100
I shouldn't tell
you this, but...

56:07.180 --> 56:08.300
I've fallen in love.

56:08.380 --> 56:10.420
Really ?

56:10.500 --> 56:12.500
Yes.

56:12.580 --> 56:14.420
With a student.

56:14.500 --> 56:15.580
With a student.

56:15.660 --> 56:17.260
Exactly.

56:17.340 --> 56:19.180
I know.

56:19.260 --> 56:21.540
You think,
Am I still up for this ?

56:21.660 --> 56:23.460
All this intensity,
all those arguments,

56:23.580 --> 56:26.220
doors being slammed.

56:26.300 --> 56:29.100
Well, you know what it's like.

56:30.300 --> 56:31.540
Are you feeling better ?

56:33.700 --> 56:34.740
A little.

56:34.820 --> 56:36.300
Thank you.

56:40.420 --> 56:42.140
You think I'm ridiculous ?

56:44.100 --> 56:46.380
Ridiculous ?

56:46.460 --> 56:48.980
Fortunate, too.

57:17.860 --> 57:20.220
I'm going to leave you
at Mrs. Latch's.

57:20.300 --> 57:22.140
I have to do something.

57:32.940 --> 57:35.380
Mommy, I don't want to go.

57:35.460 --> 57:37.500
You have to. I'm sorry.

57:37.580 --> 57:39.660
I have something to do
before Daddy gets home.

58:25.460 --> 58:27.260
Hello.

58:27.340 --> 58:28.780
Hi, Mrs. Latch.

58:28.860 --> 58:30.420
My boy's not very happy.

58:31.500 --> 58:33.660
Mommy, I don't want
to do this.

58:33.700 --> 58:36.100
I have to go, honey.

58:37.380 --> 58:39.540
Your mommy has things
she has to do.

58:39.620 --> 58:41.020
Come in, I got cookies.

58:42.380 --> 58:43.300
Okay, baby ?

58:45.180 --> 58:46.740
You have to be brave now.

58:48.260 --> 58:49.140
Don't worry now.

58:49.220 --> 58:50.540
It's going to be fine.

58:50.620 --> 58:51.540
Well...

59:08.580 --> 59:09.500
Honey !

59:28.900 --> 59:31.060
Come on. Come on, darling.

59:35.380 --> 59:37.700
Mommy !

59:37.740 --> 59:38.660
- Stop it.
- No !

59:38.700 --> 59:39.900
Darling, stop it.

59:39.940 --> 59:41.020
Mommy !

59:41.140 --> 59:42.140
- All right.
- Mommy !

59:42.180 --> 59:44.020
Mommy !

59:44.100 --> 59:45.380
Mommy !

59:47.380 --> 59:48.340
Come on.

59:48.420 --> 59:49.780
Mommy !

59:50.820 --> 59:53.300
Mommy !

59:54.500 --> 59:57.020
No !

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:29.380
Breakfast is served

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.300
between 7:00 and 11:00
in the Regency Room,

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.580
and room service is available

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.140
24 hours.

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.340
Thank you, ma'am.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.900
Is there anything else
you need ?

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:43.540
Yes, um...

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.460
No.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:47.100
Not to be disturbed.

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.700
<i>'Did it matter, then ? '
She asked herself,</i>

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.100
<i>walking toward Bon Street.</i>

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:09.260
<i>Did it matter that she must
inevitably cease completely ?</i>

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:12.900
<i>All this must go on
without her.</i>

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.020
<i>Did she resent it ?</i>

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.940
<i>Or did it not become consoling</i>

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:23.780
<i>to believe that death
ended absolutely ?</i>

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:28.140
<i>It is possible to die.</i>

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.420
It is possible...

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.860
<i>...to die.</i>

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:38.820
There was a lovely coat
for Angelica at Harrod's,

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.340
then nothing for the boys.

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:41.500
It seems so unfair.

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.100
Why should Angelica
be favored ?

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.500
Virginia ?

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.780
Virginia ?

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.220
Virginia !

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:57.220
What are you thinking about ?

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.860
Are you still with us ?

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:26.620
Your aunt's a very
lucky woman, Angelica...

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.060
because she has two lives.

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:31.460
She has the life
she's leading,

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.020
and also the book she's writing.

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:38.180
This makes her very
fortunate indeed.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.220
What were you thinking about ?

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:10.220
I was going to kill
my heroine...

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:13.620
but I've changed my mind.

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:17.660
I... I can't.

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.140
I fear I may have to kill
someone else instead.

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.980
Oh, Quentin !

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.300
We're ready !

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.420
A fascinating visit.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.660
We enjoyed it thoroughly.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.940
Do you have to go already ?

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:56.820
I do wish you wouldn't go.

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:57.780
Oh, Virginia,

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.580
the last thing you want
is our noisiness.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:04.100
My hopeless, clumsy boys.

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:05.940
Say good-bye, boys.

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:08.300
Bye !

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.740
You'll return to what ?

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:13.180
Tonight ?

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:18.420
Oh, just some...
insufferable dinner.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.340
Not even you could
envy, Virginia.

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:22.820
But I do.

01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:59.580
Say something, Nessa.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.220
Didn't you think
I seemed better ?

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.540
Yes...

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:06.940
Yes... Virginia,
you seemed better.

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.660
You think...

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.980
You think I may one day escape ?

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:29.140
One day. One...

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:31.700
Nessa.

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:35.260
Nessa !

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:36.860
Come on, Nessa.

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.460
Come, Angelica, we must go.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:41.860
Come on !

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:42.820
Good-bye.

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.860
Good-bye, little girl.

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.540
Angelica !

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:48.940
The train !

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.660
We're going to miss the train.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.140
Come on. Hurry up.

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.140
Big step.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.780
Come on, come on, come on !

01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:04.380
I want to go home.

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:05.340
Yeah, all right.

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.700
We stayed too long,
we've missed the train.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.860
Stay close.

01:09:29.859 --> 01:09:31.340
I'm sorry, I know.

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:32.740
I tried to get here earlier.

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:34.300
I tried, okay ? Don't start.

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:36.140
I know,

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:39.819
it's just incredibly important
because it's your party.

01:09:39.899 --> 01:09:42.380
Julia, how have you been doing ?

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.859
I'm fine.

01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:45.700
Come here.

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:48.460
What have you been doing ?

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.819
Well, studying, Mom.

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:55.620
Um...

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.540
So, what should I do ? Chairs ?

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.780
No. Let's clear off the desk
first.

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:03.660
You can take it
into the bedroom.

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:06.020
I bumped into Louis Waters.

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.300
Oh, you did ?

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.500
Where ?

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.460
In the street.

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:13.860
They're all here, aren't they ?

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:14.940
All the ghosts.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.660
All of the ghosts are
assembling for the party.

01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:21.380
He's so weird.

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:23.820
Oh, what ?

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.140
You can't see that ?

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:27.580
You can't see that
Louis Waters is weird ?

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.180
I can see that he's sad.

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:36.500
Well... all your friends
are sad.

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.460
You've been crying.
What's happening ?

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.540
All it is,
I looked around this room,

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:49.340
<i>and I thought,
I'm giving a party.</i>

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:51.900
<i>All I want to do
is give a party.</i>

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:53.180
And ?

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.940
I know why he does it ;
he does it deliberately.

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.860
Oh, is this Richard ?

01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.380
Of course.

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:02.140
He did it this morning.

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.100
He gives me that look.

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:05.540
What look ?

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.060
To say...

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:12.780
<i>Your life is... trivial.</i>

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:16.700
<i>You are so trivial.</i>

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:19.100
Just...

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:20.620
daily stuff, you know.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.980
Schedules and parties
and... details.

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:26.700
That's what he means... by it,
that is what he's saying.

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:28.860
Mom, it only matters
if you think it's true.

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:32.060
Well ?

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.980
Do you ? Tell me.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:39.020
When I'm with him, I feel...

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.260
Yes, I am living.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.340
And when I'm not with him...

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.900
Yes, everything does seem
sort of s...

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:55.180
...silly.

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.820
I don't mean with you.

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.060
Oh, I...

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:05.780
God. Jesus.

01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.940
Never with you.

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.060
It's all the rest of it.

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:16.340
Sally ?

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.300
The rest of it.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.140
False comfort.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.660
Because ?

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.660
<i>If you say to me,
When were you happiest ?</i>

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:31.820
Mom...

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:34.300
<i>Tell me the moment
you were happiest.</i>

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:37.420
I know, I know,
it was years ago.

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.420
Yeah.

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:44.860
All you're saying is...
you were once young.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.300
I remember one morning...

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.340
getting up at dawn,

01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:59.540
there was such a sense
of possibility.

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.460
You know ?
That feeling ?

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.540
Hmm ?

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:04.860
And I remember
thinking to myself,

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:07.700
<i>So, this is the
beginning of happiness.</i>

01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:09.500
<i>This is where it starts.</i>

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:12.540
<i>And, of course, there
will always be more.</i>

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:18.340
It never occurred to me

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.340
it wasn't the beginning.

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:26.140
It was happiness.

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:31.660
It was the moment...

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.860
right then.

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:57.260
Ah, Nelly, good evening.
I was wondering

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:58.420
if you'd seen Mrs. Woolf.

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.380
I thought you knew, sir.

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:02.380
Mrs. Woolf has gone out.

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:39.020
Excuse me ! Excuse me !

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:07.180
Mr. Woolf, what an
unexpected pleasure.

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:08.700
Perhaps you could tell me

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:10.860
exactly what you think
you're doing ?

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.220
What I was doing ?

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:13.540
I went to look for you,
and you weren't there.

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:16.060
You were working in the garden.
I didn't wish to disturb you.

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:17.780
You disturb me
when you disappear.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:18.780
I didn't disappear.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:21.900
I went for a walk.

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:23.460
A walk ?!
Is that all ?

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.100
Just a walk ?

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.860
Virginia, we must go home now.
Nelly's cooking dinner.

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:31.260
She's already had
a very difficult day.

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:33.020
It's just our obligation
to eat Nelly's dinner.

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.340
There is no such
obligation.

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:37.620
No such obligation exists.

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.660
Virginia,

01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.220
you have an obligation
to your own sanity.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:42.300
I have endured this custody !

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.700
I have endured
this imprisonment.

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:46.020
Oh, Virginia !

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:48.700
I am attended by
doctors, everywhere.

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.540
I am attended by doctors

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:53.100
who inform me of
my own interests !

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:54.300
They know your interests.

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:55.340
They do not !

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:57.180
They do not speak
for my interests.

01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:58.500
Virginia, I can...

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:00.860
I can see that it must be
hard for a woman of your...

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:02.700
- Of what ? Of my what, exactly ?
- Uh, your...

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:03.780
your talents to see

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:05.700
that she may not be
the best judge

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:06.900
of her own condition !

01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.900
Who, then, is a better judge ?

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:10.180
You have a history !

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.500
You have a history
of confinement.

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:14.980
We brought you to Richmond

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:17.940
because you have a history
of fits, moods, blackouts,

01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.460
hearing voices.

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:21.420
We brought you here

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:22.860
to save you
from the irrevocable damage

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:25.980
you intended upon yourself.

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.620
You've tried to kill yourself
twice !

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:33.780
I live daily with that threat.

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:36.220
I set up the press...
we set up the printing press

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:38.260
not just for itself,

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:41.500
not just purely for itself,
but so that you might have

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:44.860
a ready source
of absorption and of remedy.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.100
Like needlework ?

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:49.260
It was done for you !

01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:51.500
It was done for your betterment !

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:53.540
It was done out of love !

01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:58.980
If I didn't know you better,
I'd call this ingratitude.

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.900
I am ungrateful ?

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:04.060
You call me ungrateful ?

01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:09.180
My life has been stolen from me.

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.700
I'm living in a town
I have no wish to live in.

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:19.220
I'm living... a life
I have no wish to live.

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:25.700
How did this happen ?

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:41.500
It is time for us
to move back to London.

01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:48.940
I miss London.

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:51.940
I miss London life.

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:56.500
This is not you speaking,
Virginia.

01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:57.980
This is an aspect
of your illness.

01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:59.940
- It's not you.
- It is me. It is my voice.

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:01.020
It's not your voice.

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.260
It's mine and mine alone.

01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:03.700
This is the voice
that you hear.

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:06.380
It is not ! It is mine !

01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:08.340
I'm dying in this town !

01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:14.220
If you were thinking clearly,
Virginia,

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:15.540
you'd recall it was London

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:17.220
that brought you low.

01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:20.060
If I were thinking clearly...

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:23.780
If I were thinking clearly...

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:26.460
We brought you to Richmond
to give you peace.

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:29.260
If I were thinking clearly,
Leonard,

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:33.140
I would tell you that I wrestle
alone in the dark,

01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:36.300
in the deep dark,
and that only I can know,

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:39.260
only I can understand
my own condition.

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.100
You live with the threat...
you tell me...

01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:43.980
you live with the threat
of my extinction.

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.460
Leonard, I live with it,

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:48.980
too.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:55.020
This is my right.

01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:57.260
It is the right
of every human being.

01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:00.740
I choose not the suffocating
anesthetic of the suburbs,

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:02.980
but the violent jolt
of the capital.

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.740
That is my choice.

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:07.260
The meanest patient,

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:09.860
yes, even the very lowest
is allowed some say

01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:12.460
in the matter of her own
prescription.

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.780
Thereby she defines
her humanity.

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.900
I wish, for your sake, Leonard,

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:31.300
I could be happy in this
quietness.

01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:36.500
But if it is a choice between
Richmond and death,

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:38.220
I choose death.

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.540
Very well, London, then.

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.020
We'll go back to London.

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:30.140
You hungry ?

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.740
I'm a little hungry myself.

01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:58.660
Come along.

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.740
London train on platform one !

01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:04.820
This is the London train
terminating at Vauxhall.

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:13.660
You cannot find peace
by avoiding life, Leonard.

01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:23.340
This is the London train !

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:28.340
London train on platform one !

01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:45.620
Mommy !

01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:48.260
Mommy !

01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:59.260
Hey. Hey, there, bug.

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.260
Hey, what's wrong ?

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:03.020
Hi, Mrs. Latch.

01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.140
Sorry I'm late.

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.220
He's fine.

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:06.220
He's been fine.

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.700
He's, he's just happy
to see you.

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.980
Aw, it couldn't have been
that bad, could it ? Hmm ?

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:11.660
So, you got it cut, then ?

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.540
Oh, yes, yes. No problem.

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:14.460
Looks great.

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:15.900
Well, they didn't have
to do very much.

01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:17.580
Well, we had a fine time

01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:18.900
together.

01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.860
Thank you very much.

01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:29.660
So, that wasn't too bad, was it ?

01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:31.220
I wasn't gone too long.

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:33.300
No, you weren't long.

01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:35.100
That's right.

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:40.460
At one point...

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.420
I don't know.

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:49.780
There was a moment where
I thought I might be longer.

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:51.580
But I changed my mind.

01:23:59.060 --> 01:23:59.980
What is it, honey ?

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:03.420
Mommy, I love you.

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.540
I love you, too, baby.

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:17.420
What's wrong ?

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:22.060
What ?

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:30.860
Don't worry, honey,
everything's fine.

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:33.580
We're going to have
a wonderful party,

01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:37.300
and we've made your daddy
such a nice cake.

01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:44.220
I love you, sweetheart.

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:47.660
You're my guy.

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:25.380
Mommy !

01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:27.700
Mommy !

01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:24.740
Richard, it's me. I'm early.

01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:31.180
What the hell is going on ?

01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:33.060
Richard !

01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:38.140
What are you doing here ?
You're early !

01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:40.380
Wha-What is going on here ?

01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.020
What are you doing ?

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:43.820
I-I had this wonderful idea.

01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:47.020
I needed some light.
I needed to let in some light !

01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:49.660
Richard, what are you doing ?

01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:51.980
I had this fantastic notion.

01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:54.180
I took the Xanax
and the Ritalin together.

01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:55.660
It-it never occurred to me.

01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:56.340
Richard...

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:57.460
Don't come near me !

01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:07.580
It seemed to me I needed
to let in some light.

01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:13.180
What do you think ?
I cleared away all the windows.

01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:15.740
All right, Richard,
do me one simple favor.

01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:16.900
Come. Come sit.

01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:19.780
I don't think I can make it
to the party, Clarissa.

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:20.900
You don't have to go
to the party.

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.180
You don't have to go
to the ceremony.

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:23.820
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:25.340
You can do as you like.

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:28.300
But I still have to face
the hours, don't I ?

01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:30.380
I mean, the hours
after the party,

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:32.620
and the hours after that...

01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:35.620
You do have good days still.

01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:37.380
You know you do.

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.660
Not really.

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.060
I mean, it's kind of you
to say so, but it's...

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.500
I mean, it's kind of you
to say so, but it's...

01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:43.820
not really true.

01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:53.180
Are they here ?

01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:54.940
Who ?

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:55.740
The voices.

01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.540
Oh, the voices are always here.

01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:02.180
And it's the voices that you're
hearing now, isn't it ?

01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:03.900
No, no, no, no.

01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:07.220
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:15.100
I've stayed alive for you,

01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:16.940
but now you have to let me go.

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:19.620
Richard, I...

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:20.660
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.900
Wait.

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:27.500
Tell me a story.

01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:29.100
What about ?

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:32.940
Tell me a story from your day.

01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:33.940
I, um...

01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:35.860
I-I got up...

01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:37.500
Yes ?

01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:43.780
...and I went out, and, uh,
I went to buy flowers,

01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:45.660
Like Mrs. Dalloway,
in the book, you know ?

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:47.060
Yes.

01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:48.140
And it was a beautiful morning.

01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:49.620
Was it ?

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.620
Yes, it was so beautiful.

01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:53.300
It was so fresh.

01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:55.020
Oh, fresh, was it ?

01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:56.060
Yes.

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:00.260
Like a...

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:02.980
like a morning on the beach ?

01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:04.540
Yes.

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:05.660
Like that ?

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.500
Yes.

01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:11.300
Like that morning when you
walked out of that old house,

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:14.420
and you were, you were 18,
and maybe I was 19.

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.220
Yes.

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.340
I was 19 years old,

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:22.780
and I'd never seen
anything so beautiful.

01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:24.820
You...

01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:26.700
coming out of a glass door

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:29.180
in the early morning,
still sleepy.

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:31.940
Isn't it strange ?

01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:37.660
Most ordinary morning
in anybody's life.

01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:42.980
I'm afraid I can't make it
to the party, Clarissa.

01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:46.340
The party...

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.340
doesn't matter.

01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:51.740
You've been so good to me,
Mrs. Dalloway.

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:55.900
I love you.

01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:02.300
<i>I don't think two people</i>

01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.660
<i>could've been happier
than we've been.</i>

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:13.340
Oh, God, no !

01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:24.100
Happy birthday.

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:25.420
Happy birthday, Dan.

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:26.700
This is perfect.

01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:28.460
This is just perfect.

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.620
Oh, do you think so ?

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:31.740
Do you really think so ?

01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:32.700
Why, sure.

01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:34.500
You must've been
working all day.

01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:36.180
Well, that's what
we were doing.

01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:37.820
Weren't we, bug ?

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:39.980
Been working all day.

01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:41.140
This is just fantastic.

01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:42.660
It's what I've always wanted.

01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:44.420
Oh, Dan.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:45.780
One day, Richie, I'll tell you.

01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:47.500
I'll tell you
how it all happened.

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:49.420
Don't.

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:50.540
I want to.

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:53.420
I want to tell him the story.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:54.420
What happened...

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.020
when I was in the war.

01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:58.500
At war, I found myself

01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:00.660
thinking about this girl
that I had seen...

01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:02.060
I had never met her...

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:03.380
at high school,

01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:04.900
this... strange,

01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:08.860
fragile-looking girl
named Laura McGrath.

01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:13.460
Yeah.

01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:14.540
And she was shy...

01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:18.060
and she was interesting.

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:20.420
And... well,
your mother won't mind if

01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:21.380
I tell you this, Richie.

01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:22.900
She was the sort of
girl that you see

01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:23.980
sitting mostly on her own.

01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.700
And I'll tell you...

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:28.180
sometimes, when I was
in the South Pacific,

01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:29.860
the fact is

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:31.180
that I used to think

01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:32.740
about this girl.

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:33.740
Dan.

01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:35.180
I used to think

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:37.100
about bringing her to a house,

01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:39.340
to a life.

01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.380
Pretty much like this.

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.500
And it was the thought
of the happiness...

01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:51.380
the thought of this woman,

01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:52.500
the thought of this life...

01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:54.260
that's what kept me going.

01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:58.060
I had an idea of our happiness.

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.780
Why does someone have to die ?

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.180
Leonard...

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:33.900
In your book,
you said someone had to die.

01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:34.860
Hmm.

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:36.940
Why ?

01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:41.340
Is that a stupid question ?

01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:42.700
No.

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.060
I imagine my question is stupid.

01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.700
Not at all.

01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:50.220
Well ?

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:54.740
Someone has to die

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.380
in order that the rest of us
should value life more.

01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:01.260
It's contrast.

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:03.420
And who will die ?

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:06.700
Tell me.

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:12.260
The poet will die.

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.900
The visionary.

01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.740
What are you doing ?

01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:31.980
I'm brushing my teeth.

01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:38.060
Are you coming to bed ?

01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:40.580
Yeah, in a minute.

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:44.780
Come to bed, Laura Brown.

01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:50.540
I ran into Ray.

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:52.500
He said Kitty had to
go to the hospital.

01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:55.980
I know.

01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:57.260
Nothing serious.

01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:59.420
He said just a checkup.

01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.860
I'm terrified.

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.900
Why ?

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:09.420
Only I knew
that she could disappear.

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:12.460
Maybe you could

01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:14.220
go see her
in the morning, honey.

01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:23.220
I was going to.

01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:25.900
I was going to stop by.

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:28.620
I've had a wonderful day,

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:31.100
and I have you to thank.

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:40.620
Come to bed, honey.

01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:42.660
I'm coming.

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:53.780
Are you coming ?

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:55.700
Yes.

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:15.420
What ?

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.540
I was hoping
you were going to bed.

01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:22.620
I am.

01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:24.580
I am going to bed.

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:28.780
What, then ?

01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:33.940
All else is clear.

01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:36.620
The outline of the story
is planned,

01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:38.420
now one thing only.

01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:41.260
Mrs. Dalloway's destiny
must be resolved.

01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:23.700
You're Laura Brown.

01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:28.420
Yes, I'm Richard's mother.

01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:32.420
Of course.

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:35.860
I'm Clarissa Vaughan.

01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:37.660
Please come in.

01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:48.940
My friend Sally
is in the kitchen,

01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:51.260
and my daughter.

01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:53.100
I'll take this.

01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:55.980
We were having a party.

01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:59.220
We were going to have a party.

01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:00.460
I was lucky.

01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:02.220
I got the last plane
from Toronto.

01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:06.660
So, that's the monster.

01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:08.820
Hope I did the right thing.

01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:10.780
I found your number
in his phone book.

01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:15.060
Yes, he had it.

01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:17.540
We didn't speak often.

01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:32.180
It's a terrible thing,
Miss Vaughan... to outlive

01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:33.820
your whole family.

01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:39.620
Richard's father died.

01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:42.980
Yes, he-he died of cancer
quite young.

01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:44.860
And Richard's sister is dead.

01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:53.340
Obviously, you...
feel unworthy.

01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:58.180
Gives you feelings
of unworthiness.

01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:01.300
You survive and they don't.

01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:07.660
Have you read the poems ?

01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:10.140
Oh, yes. Oh...

01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:13.700
I also read the novel.

01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:25.980
You see, uh, people say
the novel is difficult.

01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:29.580
Uh... I know.

01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:31.460
They say that.

01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:38.660
I know.

01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:43.340
He had me die in the novel.

01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:45.980
I-I-I know why he did that.

01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:51.780
It hurt, of course.

01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:54.060
I can't pretend it didn't hurt,
but I...

01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:57.460
I know why he did it.

01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:04.060
You left Richard
when he was a child.

01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:09.900
I left both my children.

01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:12.540
I abandoned them.

01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:21.780
They say it's the worst thing
a mother can do.

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:35.940
You have a daughter.

01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:41.860
Yes...

01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:44.740
But I never met Julia's father.

01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:46.900
You so wanted a child.

01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:51.180
That's right.

01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:54.100
You're a lucky woman.

01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:05.540
There are times
when you don't belong,

01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:08.540
and you think you're going
to kill yourself.

01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:16.900
Once, I went to a hotel.

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:23.980
Later that night, I made a plan.

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.420
The plan was
I would leave my family

01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:30.540
when my second child was born...

01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:32.980
and that's what I did.

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:36.660
I got up one morning,

01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:39.140
made breakfast,

01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:42.540
went to the bus stop,

01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:45.660
got on a bus.

01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:47.900
I'd left a note.

01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:56.580
I got a job in a library
in Canada.

01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:04.740
It would...

01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:10.420
be wonderful to say
you regretted it.

01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:12.420
It would be easy.

01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:20.020
But what does it mean ?

01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:23.940
What does it mean to regret...

01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.780
when you have no choice ?

01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:39.100
It's what you can bear.

01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:46.540
There it is.

01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:48.900
No one's going to forgive me.

01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:58.900
It was death.

01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:01.580
I chose life.

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:01.420
Time to take your coat off.

01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:45.540
I thought you might like
a cup of tea.

01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.220
Oh my goodness.

01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:49.060
Thank you, dear.

01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:51.140
I feel like I'm stealing
your room.

01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:54.060
Um, we put the food away,

01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:55.900
so, if you're at all hungry
in the night,

01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:57.060
just help yourself.

01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:58.260
Oh, I will.

01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:00.380
Where will you sleep ?

01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:01.700
Oh, the sofa.

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:03.580
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:13.460
Good night, sweetheart.

01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:16.540
Good night.

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.500
<i>Dear Leonard,</i>

01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:42.540
<i>to look life in the face...</i>

01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:48.620
<i>always to look life in the face,</i>

01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:53.900
<i>and to know it for what it is.</i>

01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:59.300
<i>At last, to know it,</i>

01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:02.900
<i>to love it for what it is,</i>

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:06.460
<i>and then...</i>

01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:09.140
<i>to put it away.</i>

01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:15.940
<i>Leonard...</i>

01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:20.420
<i>always the years between us,</i>

01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:24.060
<i>always the years...</i>

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:29.260
<i>always... the love...</i>

01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:32.460
<i>always...</i>

01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:34.860
<i>the hours.</i>
