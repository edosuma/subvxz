00:04.757 --> 00:05.849
Hello.

00:06.592 --> 00:09.652
Hey, Mom.
I got your message.

00:11.196 --> 00:12.686
Guess where I am?

00:13.399 --> 00:14.627
In the tub.

00:14.833 --> 00:16.960
It's my
third bath today.

00:17.736 --> 00:20.261
Mmm. Mmm.

00:20.506 --> 00:23.031
I know. I know
about the drought.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.472
I actually talked
to Dr. Bell about it.

00:25.544 --> 00:29.343
He said not to feel guilty.
He said I should pamper myself.

00:32.517 --> 00:34.314
I know. He's great.

00:36.721 --> 00:38.621
Mom, he's my therapist.

00:40.491 --> 00:42.550
How can you
ask me that?

00:44.028 --> 00:46.690
I guess he's cute,
for a shrink.

00:48.499 --> 00:49.591
Hello?

00:50.101 --> 00:51.227
Mom?

00:57.942 --> 00:58.966
Hello?

01:01.646 --> 01:03.375
Jesus, Pearl.

01:04.482 --> 01:06.609
You scared me to death.

01:13.091 --> 01:14.683
Who let you in?

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:32.109 --> 01:35.567
Oh, no! No! No!

01:37.147 --> 01:38.978
No...
Oh, God!

02:19.922 --> 02:21.822
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:22.424 --> 02:24.949
<i>Disorder and confusion
everywhere</i>

02:26.962 --> 02:29.123
<i>No one seems to care</i>

02:29.298 --> 02:30.322
<i>Well, I do</i>

02:30.399 --> 02:33.129
<i>Hey, who's in charge here?</i>

02:33.235 --> 02:35.100
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:37.039 --> 02:39.337
<i>Poison in the very air
we breathe</i>

02:40.242 --> 02:42.574
<i>You know what's in the water
that you drink?</i>

02:42.711 --> 02:43.700
<i>Well, I do</i>

02:43.779 --> 02:46.475
<i>It's amazing</i>

02:47.082 --> 02:48.606
<i>People think I'm crazy</i>

02:48.684 --> 02:50.242
<i>'cause I worry
all the time</i>

02:50.386 --> 02:52.684
<i>If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too</i>

02:53.556 --> 02:55.046
<i>You better pay attention</i>

02:55.124 --> 02:57.387
<i>Or this world
we love so much</i>

02:57.992 --> 03:00.859
<i>might just kill you</i>

03:01.796 --> 03:03.229
<i>I could be wrong now</i>

03:03.898 --> 03:05.559
<i>But I don't think so</i>

03:05.867 --> 03:07.994
<i>'Cause there's
a jungle out there</i>

03:08.570 --> 03:10.367
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

03:17.187 --> 03:18.677
Morning, Mr. Monk.
I have your mail.

03:18.755 --> 03:20.518
Okay, just throw it away.

03:20.590 --> 03:22.285
I can't throw it away
until I look at it.

03:27.130 --> 03:28.859
What are you doing?

03:28.932 --> 03:29.921
The dishes.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.766
That's not the dishes.
That's a dish, one dish.

03:33.837 --> 03:36.965
You can't waste water like that, Mr.
Monk. Haven't you been reading the papers?

03:37.073 --> 03:38.540
We're in the middle
of a huge drought.

03:38.608 --> 03:39.597
Not the middle.

03:39.809 --> 03:42.209
Nobody can really say if
it's actually in the middle.

03:42.278 --> 03:44.337
It's a big problem.
It's all over the news.

03:44.414 --> 03:45.745
The reservoir's
almost empty.

03:45.815 --> 03:48.715
Nobody's washing their cars
or watering their lawns.

03:49.485 --> 03:52.386
Natalie, what was I supposed
to do? I had an omelet.

03:52.454 --> 03:55.617
That's not funny, Mr. Monk.
What if everybody felt like that?

03:55.691 --> 03:57.022
Do they?
No.

03:57.092 --> 03:58.389
Then we're okay.

03:59.161 --> 04:00.150
Uh-oh.

04:00.396 --> 04:02.227
What is it?
It's from your HMO.

04:02.297 --> 04:03.764
Oh, don't open that.

04:03.832 --> 04:04.856
It says "Important. "

04:04.933 --> 04:07.367
All the more reason.
Just throw it out.

04:08.237 --> 04:09.295
Maybe it's good news.

04:09.371 --> 04:11.236
Yeah, good news
from my HMO.

04:11.507 --> 04:14.067
What do you think,
I won a free colonoscopy?

04:14.743 --> 04:15.937
Uh-uh. Oh, no.

04:16.644 --> 04:19.204
It's a new policy.
It's about your therapy.

04:19.281 --> 04:21.579
They're putting a cap
on the number of sessions.

04:21.649 --> 04:22.878
Well, how many?

04:22.985 --> 04:24.782
Uh, 2,000.

04:25.287 --> 04:26.811
Well, that's no problem.

04:27.322 --> 04:30.120
I go four times a week,
so we're not even close.

04:30.192 --> 04:33.184
No, that's not 2,000 per
year, Mr. Monk. That's total.

04:33.295 --> 04:35.786
2,000 total.
In your life.

04:37.265 --> 04:38.527
Total?

04:39.634 --> 04:42.432
I'm sure you're fine.
That's a pretty big number.

04:42.537 --> 04:45.267
It says here that's seven
times the national average.

04:47.075 --> 04:48.064
What are you doing?

04:48.142 --> 04:49.131
I'm adding.

04:49.410 --> 04:52.436
1964...

04:52.814 --> 04:55.749
1965...

04:55.817 --> 04:57.512
Wait, you started in 1964?

04:57.585 --> 04:59.746
No, those are the
number of sessions.

05:06.994 --> 05:08.222
How many are left?

05:16.838 --> 05:18.169
Oh! That's good.

05:18.239 --> 05:20.673
Takes a water shortage
to make you appreciate

05:20.742 --> 05:24.075
how refreshing a cold glass can
be. But I guess that's human nature.

05:24.145 --> 05:25.271
When something is rationed...

05:25.346 --> 05:26.938
I don't care about that!

05:27.014 --> 05:30.312
And I don't want to hear any small
talk today, okay? No small talk.

05:30.383 --> 05:32.578
Only big talk.
Big, vast talk.

05:33.019 --> 05:34.008
Something happened.

05:35.889 --> 05:37.254
This came this morning.

05:40.627 --> 05:42.424
What are you doing now?
What are you doing?

05:42.496 --> 05:43.690
Looking for my glasses.

05:45.732 --> 05:49.395
My new bifocals, and it took
some getting used to, a few days.

05:49.469 --> 05:52.563
I don't care about that! Nobody cares
about that. Where'd you put them?

05:52.639 --> 05:53.628
I was sitting right here.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.330
Here! Here they are.

05:55.408 --> 05:57.376
Oh! Oh. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

05:57.778 --> 06:00.042
All right, thank you
very much. All right.

06:00.113 --> 06:01.102
Yeah, it's...

06:01.181 --> 06:02.341
All right. What is this?

06:03.283 --> 06:05.080
It's from my
insurance company.

06:05.285 --> 06:06.547
Oh, yes, so I see.

06:06.620 --> 06:10.784
Today's session is number 2,000, so
this is it. This is my last session.

06:11.858 --> 06:14.725
No, this is the last session
they'll reimburse you for,

06:14.795 --> 06:16.956
but you always have
the option of paying yourself.

06:17.030 --> 06:18.223
Well, how much is it?

06:18.397 --> 06:19.386
It's 200.

06:19.465 --> 06:23.458
Two... Dollars? $200?
This is my last session.

06:23.536 --> 06:26.733
Oh, my God, we have 48 minutes.
It's my last shot. We...

06:26.806 --> 06:29.434
We have to really focus,
really focus.

06:29.508 --> 06:32.477
Adrian, I don't know how much
we can do in one session.

06:32.545 --> 06:36.037
Yeah, I made a list of all
of my problems here, so...

06:36.115 --> 06:39.482
Adrian, that's not how
it works. You see,

06:39.552 --> 06:43.784
therapy is an ongoing process,
and the progress is incremental.

06:43.856 --> 06:45.619
Yeah, well, we have
to try, okay?

06:45.691 --> 06:48.159
Let's knock off as many
as we can, all right?

06:48.227 --> 06:50.661
"My fear of disappointing
my father. " Go.

06:50.729 --> 06:54.722
Adrian, I'm not comfortable
working under this kind of pressure.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.268
All right, all right. Hold on.
Okay, let's see now.

06:57.336 --> 06:58.928
We've talked about
this before.

06:59.004 --> 07:02.303
The loss of your father came at an
impressionable time in your life...

07:02.374 --> 07:04.035
Yes. ... and I think it
created an emotional vacuum.

07:04.109 --> 07:05.599
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Forget that one.

07:05.678 --> 07:07.872
We'll never get that one.
"Germophobia. "

07:08.413 --> 07:09.437
Adrian, this is not
a game show.

07:09.514 --> 07:10.503
Germophobia.

07:10.782 --> 07:13.080
All right, germophobia.
All right, germophobia.

07:13.151 --> 07:16.018
Now, your fear of germs
is not unusual.

07:16.087 --> 07:19.318
Now, some people find that it helps to
read scientific journals to demystify...

07:19.390 --> 07:22.359
Yeah, pass.
Okay, "Sibling rivalry. "

07:23.061 --> 07:24.255
Well, I've never met Ambrose.

07:24.329 --> 07:25.318
Pass!

07:25.530 --> 07:26.622
God.

07:26.998 --> 07:30.365
I've been in therapy for 10 years. Well,
I have to have something to show for it.

07:30.435 --> 07:32.903
I mean, I... We have
to cure something here.

07:32.971 --> 07:36.737
Ah! "Death of my mother. "
No. Pass.

07:37.508 --> 07:41.239
"Fear of height," pass.
"Fear of fear itself. "

07:42.580 --> 07:45.549
Oh, yeah! Here's one.
Okay. Yeah.

07:47.285 --> 07:48.809
"Claustrophobia. "

07:49.487 --> 07:50.954
Claustrophobia.

07:51.022 --> 07:54.048
Now, we've discussed that.
We talked about visualization.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.559
You remember that. I said if
you ever feel trapped somewhere,

07:56.661 --> 07:58.093
you can imagine a door.

07:58.161 --> 08:01.062
I tried that once.
The door was locked.

08:01.131 --> 08:02.428
Just imagine you have a key.

08:02.499 --> 08:04.729
Yeah, I tried that.
The key didn't fit.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.361
Maybe it's
a skeleton key.

08:06.436 --> 08:08.768
Okay, this is not working!
Come on!

08:09.039 --> 08:11.906
We have 46 minutes left.
You gotta try harder.

08:11.975 --> 08:13.033
Cure me, for God's sake.

08:13.110 --> 08:14.668
Maybe there's another
way around this, huh?

08:15.612 --> 08:18.638
Let's see now. Wait a minute. This
policy only applies to private sessions.

08:18.715 --> 08:22.242
You can join a group session. That's a
new category. It's like starting over.

08:22.886 --> 08:23.910
Group?

08:23.987 --> 08:25.955
Yes. Now, I have one group
that deals specifically

08:26.023 --> 08:28.184
with phobias and
obsessive behavior.

08:28.492 --> 08:31.120
We meet twice weekly
like clockwork.

08:31.194 --> 08:33.184
There will be
other people there?

08:33.597 --> 08:36.087
Yes, it's a group.
It's a group of people.

08:37.234 --> 08:40.169
Actually, this policy change
might be a blessing in disguise.

08:40.236 --> 08:41.966
I think you could really
benefit from this.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.506
No, they don't like me.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.639
Adrian, they haven't met you.

08:45.709 --> 08:47.108
They don't like me!

08:47.577 --> 08:49.066
I can't do it.

08:49.712 --> 08:53.045
All right. Sorry to hear that.
I hope you reconsider,

08:53.349 --> 08:55.146
'cause I think you'd
get a lot out of it.

08:55.217 --> 08:57.742
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
"Fear of bees. "

08:58.554 --> 09:03.423
Bees. Well, luckily we live in a more
urban environment, so the fear of bees...

09:03.492 --> 09:06.893
Pass. "Fear of blenders. "

09:07.330 --> 09:10.197
Well, if you don't own a blender,
then... Actually, that's...

09:10.266 --> 09:13.167
I don't think that's... Pass.
"Fear of bees in blenders. "

09:25.381 --> 09:27.076
Here he comes!
Here he comes.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.117
Mr. Monk, please,
please go to group therapy.

09:29.185 --> 09:30.675
I don't have to. I can talk
to him right here.

09:30.753 --> 09:32.084
Oh, I think you're
being ridiculous.

09:32.154 --> 09:33.917
Yeah, I'm ridiculous
like a fox.

09:34.390 --> 09:35.379
Ready?

09:36.225 --> 09:40.092
Let's go. Go.
Go, go, go. Go.

09:43.965 --> 09:45.057
Dr. Bell?

09:45.400 --> 09:46.424
Adrian?

09:46.501 --> 09:48.401
Oh, my God.
Do you bike here, too?

09:48.470 --> 09:49.459
Every morning.

09:49.537 --> 09:53.530
Oh! You know, I remember you
mentioning that once or twice.

09:53.608 --> 09:54.666
Hey, there, Natalie.

09:54.743 --> 09:55.971
Hello.
How you doing?

09:56.044 --> 09:57.136
Just fine. Just fine.

09:57.245 --> 09:59.270
You're probably wondering
how I'm doing.

09:59.347 --> 10:01.645
I been thinking a lot
about my mother.

10:01.716 --> 10:03.707
Adrian, I really can't
give you a session right now.

10:03.785 --> 10:07.585
What session? We're just a couple of
guys in the park talking about my mother.

10:07.655 --> 10:11.113
Join my group. We meet Tuesdays
and Thursdays, 10:00 a. m.

10:11.226 --> 10:13.057
Wait, Dr. Bell!
Wait! Dr. Bell!

10:13.128 --> 10:18.088
Come on, you're losing him.
Turn! Come on! Go. Mush, mush.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.428
Mush!

10:26.408 --> 10:28.932
Okay, I'll join the group.

10:29.043 --> 10:30.135
Thank God.

10:36.984 --> 10:39.475
I have come to a decision.

10:40.421 --> 10:42.719
I am not going
to the convention.

10:43.891 --> 10:45.153
I thought you told
your boss...

10:45.225 --> 10:48.388
You know what? Let him fire me. I
don't care. I hate my job anyway.

10:48.462 --> 10:52.125
It's medical supplies. It's wheelchairs
and prosthetic arms. It's gruesome.

10:52.199 --> 10:53.894
I hope he does fire me.

10:53.967 --> 10:56.492
Rhonda, I know you don't like to
travel, but this is your career.

10:56.570 --> 10:58.970
This is important. You
shouldn't just throw it all away.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.866
Dr. Bell, there's a man.

11:04.711 --> 11:09.239
Adrian. Oh, I'm so glad you
changed your mind. Come in, come in.

11:09.316 --> 11:10.476
We're just getting started.

11:10.551 --> 11:11.540
Who is this?

11:11.752 --> 11:13.481
This is Adrian.

11:13.887 --> 11:16.583
Yes, he's gonna join
our little group. Our...

11:16.657 --> 11:19.386
Our little band of brothers,
huh? I think you'll fit right in.

11:19.459 --> 11:21.427
Wait. Wait.
Without asking us?

11:21.494 --> 11:24.588
Rhonda, it's not your decision.
Adrian, this is Rhonda.

11:24.664 --> 11:26.029
Hello.

11:28.067 --> 11:31.400
It's nothing personal.
I just don't like surprises.

11:31.471 --> 11:32.460
I'm sorry.

11:32.538 --> 11:34.005
Adrian, you don't
have to apologize.

11:34.073 --> 11:35.870
You're right.
I'm sorry that I'm sorry.

11:36.375 --> 11:38.002
Adrian, this is Augie.

11:38.077 --> 11:41.171
Arachnophobia, agoraphobia,
claustrophobia.

11:41.447 --> 11:43.278
Augie, we've talked
about this before.

11:43.349 --> 11:45.249
You don't have to tell
everybody about your phobias.

11:45.318 --> 11:46.683
I just hate it
when he does that.

11:46.752 --> 11:47.810
You hate it when anybody
does anything.

11:47.887 --> 11:48.911
Oh, shut up.

11:48.988 --> 11:51.354
And, of course,
you know Harold.

11:52.091 --> 11:57.859
Hello, Adrian. I just want you to know,
for the record, I'm glad you're here.

11:57.930 --> 12:00.728
And I don't feel threatened
in the slightest.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.896
I know we haven't always seen eye to eye,
but I hope we can put our differences aside

12:04.971 --> 12:07.963
and work with Neven
together as a team.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.872
After all,
it takes a village.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.167
You call him Neven?

12:13.411 --> 12:14.400
Mmm-hmm.

12:14.479 --> 12:16.811
Well, things are a little
less formal in group therapy.

12:20.352 --> 12:21.842
Oh...

12:21.920 --> 12:24.047
You still can't shake hands.

12:25.857 --> 12:28.382
I see we have
our work cut out for us.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.291
I can shake hands.

12:37.569 --> 12:38.558
Oh.

12:38.737 --> 12:43.197
I used to use a wipe, too.
Remember? I was so germophobic.

12:43.275 --> 12:49.009
I'd always have a wipe in my pocket, like
this, and I'd wipe my hands, like this,

12:49.514 --> 12:55.783
and then I'd fold it up into a little square
and put it in my other pocket, like this.

12:57.122 --> 12:58.679
I was pathetic.

12:59.356 --> 13:01.221
Adrian, why don't you
take a seat?

13:01.292 --> 13:03.590
Excuse me. He cannot sit
there. You can't sit there!

13:03.661 --> 13:05.060
This is Barbara's seat.

13:05.129 --> 13:06.118
Barbara?

13:06.463 --> 13:09.057
Yes, she was in our group.
She died three weeks ago.

13:09.133 --> 13:10.225
She drowned in her
swimming pool.

13:10.334 --> 13:11.562
It doesn't matter
how she died!

13:11.635 --> 13:15.571
The point is that was her regular seat,
and I just think it is disrespectful.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.708
Thank you.

13:21.679 --> 13:24.204
All right, deep breath.
Good.

13:24.648 --> 13:29.551
Now, Adrian, in our last private session,
we talked a bit about claustrophobia.

13:29.620 --> 13:32.316
I think that's a good place to
start, since that's a condition

13:32.389 --> 13:33.686
that all of you
have in common.

13:33.857 --> 13:34.846
Not me.

13:35.259 --> 13:36.283
Oh, please.

13:36.360 --> 13:40.319
I mean, not anymore. I used to hate
tight spaces, but Neven cured me.

13:40.631 --> 13:41.859
Really?

13:43.033 --> 13:45.797
You're cured? But you
never mentioned that.

13:45.869 --> 13:50.771
I was about to when Adrian walked in.
You know what did it? Visualization.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.570
That was really
great advice, Dr. B.

13:53.643 --> 14:00.139
I visualized a door, and then
I visualized a key to the door.

14:01.251 --> 14:03.412
Well, that's great.
I'm really happy for you.

14:03.486 --> 14:05.454
Yeah, well, I couldn't have
done it without you, Doc.

14:05.788 --> 14:07.949
You're a god.
Thank you.

14:16.165 --> 14:18.292
That's Vietnamese.

14:19.168 --> 14:23.366
I tried it, visualization,
the key and the door.

14:24.374 --> 14:25.568
It didn't work.

14:26.309 --> 14:30.075
Why don't you have your
assistant visualize it for you?

14:30.146 --> 14:31.477
You have an assistant?

14:31.547 --> 14:35.005
Yes, Adrian has a very difficult
job, which requires an assistant.

14:35.084 --> 14:38.451
He's a decorated police
detective. He's a real hero.

14:39.454 --> 14:42.184
What about us? I mean,
we're out there all alone,

14:42.257 --> 14:45.090
assistant-less.
We have no help.

14:45.627 --> 14:48.790
We have no one to lean on.
We're the real heroes.

14:48.864 --> 14:50.456
I think Barbara's
the lucky one.

14:50.532 --> 14:52.659
She doesn't have to deal with
any of this crap anymore.

14:52.768 --> 14:55.828
Yeah, I know.
And I'm gonna miss her, too.

14:55.904 --> 14:59.465
We all miss her. We'll be
grieving for a long time.

15:02.411 --> 15:05.812
I wish I had an assistant.
She could grieve for me.

15:05.881 --> 15:08.243
What is your problem?

15:08.317 --> 15:10.751
Okay, you know, you see, now...
Now, we all have problems...

15:10.819 --> 15:14.983
You're just jealous. You've been
jealous of me since the first day we met,

15:15.057 --> 15:17.685
which, by the way, I like
to refer to as Black Tuesday.

15:17.759 --> 15:19.317
Why would I
be jealous of you?

15:19.394 --> 15:20.383
Okay.

15:20.462 --> 15:24.694
I made $210,000 last year.
How much did you make?

15:27.969 --> 15:28.992
Two million.

15:29.070 --> 15:30.469
Liar! He's lying.

15:31.105 --> 15:35.906
Admit it, Adrian. My success is
killing you. It's eating you up.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.068
What success?

15:37.345 --> 15:40.542
I'm on the city council.
People voted for me.

15:40.614 --> 15:43.879
Because they don't know you! Did
anybody here vote for this clown?

15:43.951 --> 15:44.940
Not me.

15:45.019 --> 15:47.078
Dr. Bell, you're in his
district. Did you vote for him?

15:47.154 --> 15:48.451
You're not supposed
to ask that question.

15:48.522 --> 15:52.014
That's a no. See, Neven didn't
vote for you, Harold. Suck on that.

15:52.226 --> 15:55.491
I'm gonna rezone your whole
neighborhood. I can do that!

15:55.563 --> 15:56.552
Why don't you rezone
your neuroses?

15:56.630 --> 15:59.030
I'm gonna put a Kentucky
Fried Chicken on your roof!

15:59.100 --> 16:00.567
Stop it!
Stop it, please!

16:00.634 --> 16:01.760
I know where
your roof is!

16:01.902 --> 16:02.891
Stop, please!

16:03.304 --> 16:04.931
Harold! Sit down.

16:05.072 --> 16:06.096
Please sit down, Harold.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.162
What about him?

16:07.241 --> 16:08.230
Adrian, please, sit.

16:08.309 --> 16:09.571
Yeah, please, sit.

16:09.643 --> 16:11.167
Harold, stop. Sit.

16:13.481 --> 16:15.608
Adrian, please. Down.

16:33.032 --> 16:35.364
Good. Now...

16:40.173 --> 16:42.266
I know. I know you're not a
big fan of Harold Krenshaw's.

16:42.342 --> 16:43.673
I hate him.
He can go to hell.

16:43.743 --> 16:46.769
Yeah, I understand, but besides him,
besides Harold, who can go to hell,

16:46.846 --> 16:47.938
how was the session?

16:48.014 --> 16:49.003
Awful.

16:49.249 --> 16:51.046
Well, what were
the people like?

16:51.885 --> 16:53.318
I don't know.

16:53.386 --> 16:54.375
How many were there?

16:54.454 --> 16:57.116
I don't know.
Five, eight.

16:58.591 --> 17:00.354
They hardly talked about me
at all.

17:00.427 --> 17:02.452
All they did was
drone on and on and on

17:02.529 --> 17:05.020
about their own lives
and their own problems.

17:05.098 --> 17:06.792
Yeah, Mr. Monk,
isn't that the point?

17:06.866 --> 17:09.060
Nobody cares
about them, Natalie.

17:10.536 --> 17:12.696
Dr. Bell was just as bad.

17:12.771 --> 17:17.265
He kept interrupting everybody,
telling little parables and stories.

17:17.342 --> 17:20.971
I'm wasting my time. Group
therapy never helped anybody.

17:21.046 --> 17:22.512
Then why don't you quit?

17:23.348 --> 17:24.713
Are you following us?

17:25.117 --> 17:26.641
I think you're
following me.

17:26.718 --> 17:29.551
Harold, we were here first. We
came straight from Dr. Bell's.

17:29.621 --> 17:33.387
A lot of his patients come here
because it's right across the street.

17:33.892 --> 17:35.621
For example,
that guy over there.

17:36.562 --> 17:38.689
He's not
even in our group.

17:39.097 --> 17:40.155
Not anymore.

17:40.399 --> 17:42.299
He left the nest
five weeks ago.

17:42.401 --> 17:45.393
That's Xavier Danko.
He's completely cured.

17:46.138 --> 17:48.402
He was more screwed up
than anybody.

17:50.742 --> 17:52.141
What was wrong with him?

17:52.578 --> 17:56.173
He was obsessed with an exotic
dancer named Tiffany something.

17:56.682 --> 17:59.844
He was following her.
But he got better.

18:00.251 --> 18:02.276
I want to be next.
I want to get better, too.

18:02.353 --> 18:06.551
That's why you have to leave the group,
Adrian. You're ruining everything.

18:06.624 --> 18:08.683
Mr. Monk has every right
to be there, Harold.

18:08.759 --> 18:13.526
No, he doesn't. Excuse
me! He has 20 items.

18:13.598 --> 18:16.761
It's only one item.
They're all the same.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.199
But you're buying 20.

18:18.269 --> 18:19.293
But it's the same item.

18:19.370 --> 18:20.598
But you're buying 20.

18:20.671 --> 18:22.571
Of the same item.

18:23.641 --> 18:27.600
There's the sign. It doesn't
say 12 different items.

18:30.448 --> 18:32.609
I think it's 12 items total.

18:33.017 --> 18:34.041
Thank you.

18:34.118 --> 18:37.815
Here... I'm buying the first
10, and he's buying the rest.

18:41.192 --> 18:43.888
Well played, Adrian,
well played.

18:45.796 --> 18:47.457
Sir, are you buying
anything?

18:47.565 --> 18:50.158
No, I'm just trying to
get him to quit my group.

18:50.233 --> 18:51.928
Forget it.
I'm not quitting.

18:52.002 --> 18:55.403
Why not? You were just complaining
about it five minutes ago.

18:55.472 --> 18:56.564
You said you hated it.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.107
That was before I knew
you wanted me to quit.

18:58.174 --> 18:59.163
Oh!

19:01.311 --> 19:03.472
Hey, I'll see you Thursday.
I'll save you a seat.

19:06.383 --> 19:07.475
I have a coupon.

19:09.352 --> 19:10.614
There he is.

19:14.224 --> 19:15.248
Thank you for coming.

19:15.492 --> 19:16.481
What happened?

19:16.893 --> 19:18.758
We were wondering
the same thing.

19:18.828 --> 19:20.295
Either he jumped
or was pushed.

19:20.363 --> 19:22.160
Yeah. We thought you might know the guy.

19:22.232 --> 19:24.757
His employment card,
we found it in his wallet.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.199
Dr. Bell.

19:31.107 --> 19:32.096
You know him?

19:32.509 --> 19:34.943
He was in my group.
Augie something.

19:35.011 --> 19:36.945
Yeah, Augie Wellman.

19:37.013 --> 19:39.879
He was a mechanical engineer.
He lived upstairs.

19:39.949 --> 19:42.008
So, was Mr. Wellman
depressed?

19:42.084 --> 19:43.244
Of course he was.

19:43.319 --> 19:44.547
So it was suicide?

19:45.721 --> 19:49.487
Uh... I don't think so.
Look at his wrists.

19:49.992 --> 19:52.756
Hair has been
pulled out.

19:54.029 --> 19:57.362
'Cause someone taped them.
He was tied up.

20:00.736 --> 20:02.203
Could be a serial killer.

20:03.439 --> 20:05.134
He's killing people
according to their phobias.

20:05.207 --> 20:07.641
This guy was afraid of heights,
so he pushed him off the roof.

20:07.710 --> 20:11.305
No, Augie wasn't afraid of
heights. He was afraid of spiders.

20:11.380 --> 20:12.574
That's different.

20:13.349 --> 20:16.284
He's killing people using
the opposite of their phobias.

20:17.052 --> 20:18.246
The Opposite Killer.

20:18.320 --> 20:22.086
So you're saying that the opposite
of a spider is a tall building?

20:22.157 --> 20:24.250
What do you think
the opposite of a spider is?

20:25.127 --> 20:27.425
I have no idea, but
it's not a tall building.

20:27.529 --> 20:29.258
Mmm, tell that to
the Opposite Killer.

20:33.635 --> 20:34.659
Are you crying?

20:34.836 --> 20:36.133
No, I have allergies.

20:37.572 --> 20:38.664
What are the odds?

20:39.107 --> 20:40.233
The odds of what?

20:40.908 --> 20:45.675
Two dead in two months
from the same group.

20:47.915 --> 20:51.146
It looked straight-up to me. Accidental
drowning. She had water in her lungs.

20:51.219 --> 20:54.154
She had a severe concussion like
she hit her head on the way in.

20:54.222 --> 20:55.211
Did you check the house?

20:55.289 --> 20:58.019
No, sir. I don't know what
you're expecting to find. I mean,

20:58.092 --> 21:01.027
the crime scene is long gone. The
girl was cremated eight weeks ago.

21:01.229 --> 21:02.924
The case is cold.

21:02.997 --> 21:04.362
I wonder how cold.

21:04.599 --> 21:06.123
I don't follow.

21:06.768 --> 21:10.135
Look, she died October 2nd,
in the morning.

21:10.505 --> 21:11.802
It must have been chilly.

21:11.873 --> 21:12.931
It probably was.

21:13.007 --> 21:13.996
Where's the towel?

21:14.642 --> 21:16.769
There's no towel
next to the pool.

21:18.413 --> 21:22.314
I wouldn't go swimming first thing in
the morning in October without a towel.

21:22.382 --> 21:25.749
I mean, I wouldn't go swimming
anyway, but you see what I mean.

21:28.822 --> 21:30.551
I think she was killed.

21:30.624 --> 21:33.650
Let me guess. The victim
was not afraid of water.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.854
It's him. The Opposite
Killer. That's his M.O.

21:37.931 --> 21:39.626
There is no Opposite Killer.

21:40.467 --> 21:44.961
If there were, you would have been killed
by a falling rocket scientist years ago.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.500
Okay, where are we?

21:48.575 --> 21:51.009
We got a jumper with some
hair missing from his wrists.

21:51.078 --> 21:52.375
We've got a missing towel.

21:52.446 --> 21:54.914
We can't go knocking on the
DA's door with that, not yet.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.074
All right,
let's keep digging.

22:01.221 --> 22:02.620
Oh, my God.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.652
What? What is it?

22:06.460 --> 22:09.486
I think somebody is killing
off my therapy group.

22:10.529 --> 22:12.190
Mr. Monk, you're smiling.

22:13.232 --> 22:14.221
Sorry.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.962
Somebody is killing off
my therapy group.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.698
You're still smiling.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.675
And then
there were three.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.051
Well...

22:48.701 --> 22:52.228
I think we better get started.
Who wants to go first?

22:53.539 --> 22:54.938
I know it's difficult.

22:55.474 --> 22:59.308
It's overwhelming. First,
Barbara drowning, now Augie.

23:00.079 --> 23:04.378
If you want to cancel the session,
cancel next week, I certainly understand.

23:04.449 --> 23:06.314
I don't think
we should cancel.

23:06.384 --> 23:09.046
In fact, I think we need
each other now more than ever.

23:09.120 --> 23:10.178
Oh, please.

23:10.255 --> 23:14.191
We need your strength, Neven,
your guidance. You're the beacon.

23:14.259 --> 23:17.990
You're the light that will see
us through our darkest hour.

23:18.062 --> 23:20.895
So, Harold, how is it
up there in Neven's butt?

23:20.965 --> 23:22.956
You lonely? Getting
scared of the dark?

23:23.034 --> 23:25.002
Rhonda, let's not forget
rule number one.

23:25.069 --> 23:26.366
Don't make it personal.

23:26.437 --> 23:27.665
I'm sorry.

23:27.739 --> 23:30.173
I just don't understand.
Why would Augie jump?

23:30.241 --> 23:31.708
He didn't seem
that depressed.

23:31.776 --> 23:34.768
Maybe he saw a ladybug.
Or a firefly.

23:34.846 --> 23:35.835
He didn't jump.

23:36.247 --> 23:37.236
The newspapers said...

23:37.315 --> 23:40.341
I know what they said. The
police withheld some information.

23:40.418 --> 23:43.353
The truth is we still don't
know the exact cause of death.

23:43.655 --> 23:44.644
Oh?

23:44.722 --> 23:47.088
I think Augie was murdered.
I think someone tied him up

23:47.158 --> 23:48.318
and dragged him to that roof.

23:48.393 --> 23:50.020
Oh, my God!

23:50.161 --> 23:52.754
Dr. Bell, I don't know what
to feel. Tell me what to feel.

23:52.830 --> 23:54.491
I think we should
all feel confused.

23:54.565 --> 23:56.294
Confused. I can do that.

23:58.602 --> 24:01.070
I think Barbara
was murdered, too.

24:01.138 --> 24:03.538
What? You said "think. " You're
telling me you're not sure?

24:03.607 --> 24:05.404
I think someone,
for some reason,

24:05.475 --> 24:08.103
is killing this group off,
one by one.

24:09.713 --> 24:11.010
What do the police say?

24:11.081 --> 24:12.343
They're looking into it.

24:12.649 --> 24:14.708
They'll probably want
to talk to each of us.

24:14.952 --> 24:15.976
Why?

24:17.788 --> 24:18.914
They think
it's one of us?

24:18.989 --> 24:20.013
It's possible.

24:20.090 --> 24:21.114
One of us?

24:21.191 --> 24:22.180
It's possible.

24:22.359 --> 24:28.389
There is a possibility that
one of you is not quite sane.

24:34.838 --> 24:38.274
All right, let's not get carried
away here. It's just a theory.

24:38.342 --> 24:40.207
It was him.
It was Monk!

24:40.277 --> 24:41.300
Excuse me?

24:41.377 --> 24:45.143
He hates us. I heard him yesterday
talking at the supermarket.

24:45.214 --> 24:46.476
He hates all of us.

24:46.549 --> 24:49.177
I didn't say that,
exactly.

24:49.252 --> 24:52.050
And he said
you were boring.

24:52.121 --> 24:55.488
He said that he hated all your
stories, which, in my opinion,

24:55.558 --> 24:57.219
are the highlights
of every session.

24:57.293 --> 24:58.521
That's not what
I meant, Doctor.

24:58.594 --> 24:59.891
That's all right, Adrian.

24:59.962 --> 25:02.522
I admit that I have an
occasion to ramble on.

25:02.598 --> 25:04.896
I get carried away
occasionally. It's all right.

25:11.941 --> 25:13.806
What in God's name
are you doing?

25:13.876 --> 25:15.400
Investigating.

25:15.678 --> 25:17.236
Harold, please sit down.

25:20.850 --> 25:22.579
Who had a motive?

25:23.452 --> 25:25.977
A motive for murder?

25:29.825 --> 25:31.155
You did.

25:31.626 --> 25:35.653
You resent the group. Admit it,
you want Neven all to yourself!

25:35.730 --> 25:36.856
That's ridiculous.

25:36.932 --> 25:37.921
Is it?

25:38.300 --> 25:42.896
Which of us would know how to commit a
perfect crime without leaving a single clue?

25:43.238 --> 25:45.502
Who's the famous
homicide expert?

25:46.107 --> 25:47.131
I am.

25:47.208 --> 25:48.436
And who's in the
perfect position

25:48.510 --> 25:51.172
to steer the investigation
away from himself?

25:53.281 --> 25:54.373
Me.

25:54.983 --> 25:57.952
All right, hold on here.
Adrian was trying to warn us.

25:58.119 --> 25:59.746
A classic cry for help.

26:00.422 --> 26:04.859
Or was it an attempt
to divert suspicion?

26:05.560 --> 26:06.549
Hmm...

26:07.262 --> 26:09.924
Do you even have
an alibi for Wednesday?

26:13.134 --> 26:14.123
No.

26:14.903 --> 26:16.894
How about when
Barbara was killed?

26:19.240 --> 26:22.174
Of course you don't.
Here's what happened.

26:23.510 --> 26:27.276
<i>The HMO changed their policy.
No more private sessions.</i>

26:27.348 --> 26:28.508
<i>You were desperate.</i>

26:28.582 --> 26:32.245
<i>You needed to kill one of us so
there'd be an opening in the group.</i>

26:35.656 --> 26:36.645
Do you deny it?

26:36.724 --> 26:37.884
Of course I deny it.

26:37.958 --> 26:40.256
Which is exactly what
a guilty man would say!

26:40.327 --> 26:41.487
That's true.

26:43.831 --> 26:45.025
Augie was next.

26:45.132 --> 26:49.296
<i>You lured him up to the roof.
It was easy. He trusted you.</i>

26:49.470 --> 26:50.698
<i>But I don't.</i>

26:50.771 --> 26:55.071
<i>You're planning to pick us off, one by
one, until you have Neven all to yourself.</i>

26:58.879 --> 27:00.039
He's the guy.

27:00.114 --> 27:05.017
But what you are suggesting is absurd.
Adrian's not capable of killing anyone.

27:14.293 --> 27:16.227
Mr. Monk,
you're not a killer.

27:16.763 --> 27:17.752
Are you sure?

27:17.830 --> 27:19.058
Yes, of course I am.

27:19.665 --> 27:21.132
What if Harold
is right?

27:21.401 --> 27:24.165
It all fits. I know a
thousand ways to kill people.

27:24.237 --> 27:26.228
And I have a motive.
I admit it.

27:27.340 --> 27:29.205
I want Dr. Bell
to myself.

27:29.275 --> 27:31.641
No, Mr. Monk, it couldn't
be you. You have an alibi.

27:31.711 --> 27:32.700
What alibi?

27:33.046 --> 27:34.445
I was here.
I was alone.

27:34.514 --> 27:37.540
No, you weren't alone.
You were with yourself.

27:37.617 --> 27:39.778
I wasn't alone,
I was with myself?

27:39.852 --> 27:43.379
Exactly. You would know if you were
sneaking out and killing people.

27:43.456 --> 27:45.617
That's the kind of thing
that people tend to remember.

27:45.691 --> 27:49.354
Maybe not. I black out
sometimes. You've seen it.

27:49.962 --> 27:53.295
Sometimes five hours go by,
I don't know where I've been.

27:53.366 --> 27:55.334
That's true, but it's always
triggered by something,

27:55.401 --> 27:57.266
like you've seen
yourself naked,

27:57.336 --> 27:59.804
or you saw a documentary
on the nature channel.

28:16.788 --> 28:18.483
Just stop...

28:19.991 --> 28:22.551
Look at me! Look at me! It wasn't
you. It couldn't have been you.

28:22.627 --> 28:25.289
Let's move on. Who
else was in the group?

28:25.363 --> 28:26.557
There's Harold.
Could it be Harold?

28:26.631 --> 28:27.620
I don't think so.

28:27.699 --> 28:30.327
You're right. God would never do
that. It would make me too happy.

28:30.402 --> 28:32.165
Okay, let's eliminate Harold.

28:33.305 --> 28:34.294
Who's left?

28:34.372 --> 28:35.361
Rhonda.

28:36.808 --> 28:38.105
Rhonda.

28:43.415 --> 28:45.178
I think
they're closed.

28:51.655 --> 28:53.054
Door's open.

28:54.725 --> 28:55.953
Rhonda?

28:56.727 --> 28:58.024
Hello?

28:58.963 --> 29:00.954
It's Adrian from group.

29:06.470 --> 29:07.459
Do you smell that?

29:07.538 --> 29:10.006
Do I smell that? I'll be smelling
that for the rest of my life.

29:11.408 --> 29:12.534
Rhonda.

29:21.685 --> 29:22.879
She's dead.

29:25.623 --> 29:27.352
She mixed
bleach and ammonia?

29:27.591 --> 29:28.580
Chlorine gas.

29:29.727 --> 29:31.058
Rhonda's worked here
for nine years.

29:31.128 --> 29:33.062
She would never make
a mistake like that.

29:33.130 --> 29:36.327
Murder. Oh, my God,
Mr. Monk, that's three.

29:36.867 --> 29:41.769
Okay, Natalie, if I was
going to kill somebody,

29:42.939 --> 29:47.069
this is exactly how I would
do it, with cleaning supplies.

29:47.143 --> 29:50.601
Look, Mr. Monk, it couldn't
have been you. Relax.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.477
These aren't your brands.

29:52.549 --> 29:55.416
You buy the good stuff. These
are the cheap store brands.

29:55.485 --> 29:57.476
That's true. That's true.

29:59.222 --> 30:00.416
Danko.
Who?

30:00.523 --> 30:02.957
Xavier Danko.
The other patient.

30:03.059 --> 30:04.822
We saw him at the
supermarket, remember?

30:05.361 --> 30:09.263
<i>He was buying cleaning
supplies, the exact same bottles.</i>

30:09.699 --> 30:13.897
Harold said that he quit group
therapy about a month before

30:14.571 --> 30:16.562
Barbara O'Keefe
was murdered.

30:17.640 --> 30:21.007
Danko must have revealed
something in therapy,

30:21.077 --> 30:23.341
something big,
something worth killing for.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.143
Natalie!
What'd you do?

30:28.484 --> 30:31.453
God! Come on, let's get you
some fresh air. Come on.

30:32.120 --> 30:34.748
Come on. This way.
Come on.

30:50.272 --> 30:51.830
Somebody's here.

30:56.411 --> 30:58.743
It's okay, I'll go.
You get the next one.

31:43.924 --> 31:46.791
Oh, my God, I'm buried
alive! I'm buried...

31:48.329 --> 31:50.456
Help me! Let me out!

31:50.531 --> 31:53.898
It's no use. I've been
banging on it for an hour.

31:56.103 --> 31:57.968
I still think it was you.

32:11.352 --> 32:13.819
Help me!
Please...

32:13.887 --> 32:16.412
Hello. Please.
Let us out!

32:16.489 --> 32:18.047
Help! Help!

32:18.858 --> 32:21.452
Help! Please!

32:21.528 --> 32:22.552
Get us out of here!

32:22.629 --> 32:23.994
Let us out!

32:24.064 --> 32:25.429
God, help...

32:28.802 --> 32:30.565
Please stop touching me.

32:30.637 --> 32:32.127
I'm not...
You're touching me.

32:32.205 --> 32:34.366
I'm not touching you.
You're touching me.

32:34.441 --> 32:35.806
Just stay on your side.

32:35.875 --> 32:38.002
I'm... I don't have a side!

32:38.378 --> 32:40.903
Just back up
4 or 5 millimeters.

32:42.349 --> 32:44.112
Okay, that's your side.

32:44.184 --> 32:48.143
Now, this is my side. From
that end of the spare tire

32:48.555 --> 32:49.647
to the jumper cables.

32:49.889 --> 32:52.289
Stay over there
and we'll be fine.

32:57.597 --> 32:59.724
My side's carpeted.

32:59.799 --> 33:00.823
My side's quieter.

33:00.900 --> 33:01.888
That's impossible.

33:02.034 --> 33:04.195
Your side has the muffler,
so my side is quieter.

33:04.269 --> 33:05.293
Oh, grow up!

33:05.371 --> 33:06.360
You grow up.

33:06.438 --> 33:07.735
I don't feel like it.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.505
Captain Stottlemeyer, please.

33:21.653 --> 33:24.053
Yeah, I gotta get out of
here. I can't stand it!

33:24.189 --> 33:26.157
The ceiling is crushing me!

33:26.291 --> 33:28.316
I feel it closing in!
Help!

33:28.427 --> 33:30.486
It's like I'm being
buried alive! I can't!

33:30.562 --> 33:33.087
Stop it. Harold! Harold!

33:33.165 --> 33:35.395
You're making it very hard
for me to panic!

33:37.102 --> 33:39.434
Just calm down, please!

33:45.210 --> 33:48.179
I thought you were cured.
What about your technique?

33:48.313 --> 33:51.476
Visualization with the door
and the key and all that?

33:51.550 --> 33:56.885
Oh, it doesn't work. It never
worked. I was trying to impress Dr. B.

33:59.390 --> 34:01.688
Why do I do that?
Why do I...

34:01.759 --> 34:04.922
Why do I care
what people think?

34:06.864 --> 34:08.331
What's wrong with me?

34:10.400 --> 34:12.391
There's nothing
wrong with you.

34:14.739 --> 34:16.366
The truth is

34:17.141 --> 34:18.335
I actually

34:19.510 --> 34:20.498
admire you.

34:20.578 --> 34:21.567
Stop it.

34:21.646 --> 34:23.112
No, no, I mean it.
Don't.

34:23.246 --> 34:26.216
I mean it. Look, we're...

34:26.884 --> 34:28.647
We're basically
the same guy.

34:28.719 --> 34:31.847
We have the same kinds of
problems, the same issues.

34:31.922 --> 34:34.721
But you, you're out there.

34:35.159 --> 34:38.094
You're in the world.
You have a family.

34:38.161 --> 34:40.187
You have a real job.

34:40.465 --> 34:43.194
You don't let it stop you.

34:44.134 --> 34:45.829
That's nice of you to say.

34:47.137 --> 34:51.835
Look at me. Harold, look at
me. Look, look. Look at me. Hey.

34:56.480 --> 34:59.643
I think we've been looking
at this the wrong way.

35:02.819 --> 35:06.653
This trunk, you know,
these walls,

35:08.959 --> 35:12.759
they're not
closing in on us.

35:12.829 --> 35:13.818
They're not?

35:13.897 --> 35:18.163
No. They're... They're
protecting us, really.

35:18.235 --> 35:19.429
Protecting us?

35:19.503 --> 35:22.438
Ah. They're keeping
the bad stuff out.

35:22.939 --> 35:23.963
Protecting us?

35:24.241 --> 35:29.804
Yeah. Protecting us from germs
and snakes and harmonicas.

35:29.880 --> 35:33.576
And nature and my mother
and her new boyfriend.

35:33.649 --> 35:36.511
And Xavier Danko.

35:37.152 --> 35:38.744
Yeah, that's right.

35:42.358 --> 35:45.088
This trunk is our friend.

35:48.097 --> 35:49.621
Wow.
I know.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.594
I've been in therapy
for 10 years.

35:55.070 --> 35:59.598
I think this is the first real
breakthrough I've ever had.

36:00.509 --> 36:04.343
This group therapy thing
really works.

36:10.886 --> 36:12.353
It really does.

36:25.066 --> 36:27.330
I wish Dr. B could see us.
He wouldn't believe it.

36:36.010 --> 36:37.443
He's walking away.

36:38.713 --> 36:40.203
Keep cranking.

36:47.088 --> 36:48.180
Oh! It's working.

36:48.256 --> 36:49.689
Oh! This was
a good idea.

37:04.439 --> 37:05.633
Here.

37:06.507 --> 37:07.496
Okay.

37:18.151 --> 37:19.448
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

37:19.519 --> 37:20.884
My pleasure. Hold still.

37:23.056 --> 37:24.489
Oh, no.
What?

37:24.558 --> 37:25.752
That's Neven's house.

37:26.393 --> 37:27.690
How do you know?

37:28.028 --> 37:29.996
He had a cocktail party
last summer.

37:30.764 --> 37:32.891
And he invited you?

37:34.201 --> 37:35.896
I didn't say that.

37:36.570 --> 37:39.562
Okay, we... We have to find
a phone and call the police.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.369
There's not enough time.

37:42.042 --> 37:45.637
It takes the police 4 minutes
and 20 seconds to get here.

37:46.647 --> 37:47.944
Don't ask.

37:49.683 --> 37:51.173
Be careful.
He's got a gun.

37:51.284 --> 37:52.945
Listen, Adrian, if
anything happens to me...

37:53.020 --> 37:54.817
Nothing's gonna happen
to you. I won't let it.

37:56.390 --> 37:57.482
Ready?

37:57.557 --> 37:58.546
Let's do it.

38:07.133 --> 38:08.828
Well, there you are.

38:08.901 --> 38:11.529
I was about to come and get you.
The police will be here soon.

38:11.604 --> 38:14.471
I'm so sorry.

38:14.540 --> 38:17.031
Xavier was just telling me
how he killed Tiffany Bolt.

38:17.109 --> 38:18.406
The woman
he was following?

38:18.711 --> 38:19.700
Yeah, that's right.

38:20.446 --> 38:23.609
He put her car and her body in the
reservoir, then he began to get worried.

38:23.683 --> 38:26.117
Of course,
the water shortage.

38:26.385 --> 38:29.081
Right. The reservoir levels
have been dropping.

38:29.155 --> 38:32.352
He was afraid the car and the
body were about to be discovered.

38:33.526 --> 38:35.323
What did I do?

38:35.394 --> 38:38.955
He told everyone in the
group about his obsession.

38:39.865 --> 38:44.325
So you were the only people on earth
who could connect him to that poor girl.

38:44.403 --> 38:47.395
Right. He was trying to kill
us before the body was found.

38:48.941 --> 38:51.171
Actually, we have
some news, too.

38:51.777 --> 38:52.801
Oh, right.

38:52.878 --> 38:54.037
Yeah. Well...

38:54.612 --> 38:58.708
Harold and I were locked in
the trunk, but we dealt with it.

39:00.018 --> 39:02.885
We had a real
breakthrough, actually.

39:02.987 --> 39:07.947
I... I definitely think we can cross
claustrophobia off both of our lists.

39:08.526 --> 39:09.515
Dr. Bell?

39:12.630 --> 39:13.722
Do you believe in God?

39:13.832 --> 39:19.896
Hey! Excuse me. My friend was just
talking. We didn't interrupt you.

39:22.340 --> 39:23.602
Go ahead.

39:28.913 --> 39:34.715
See, what we realized was the trunk
was really protecting us from germs...

39:34.786 --> 39:35.775
Nature.

39:35.854 --> 39:37.014
Snakes.
Puppets.

39:37.088 --> 39:38.214
Thunder.
Piñatas.

39:38.289 --> 39:39.415
Milk, of course.

39:46.002 --> 39:47.526
Well, it's 10:00.

39:48.205 --> 39:49.832
I think we should
get started.

39:50.607 --> 39:51.938
Where's everyone else?

39:52.475 --> 39:56.036
Well, as you know, we had three
members who were... Well, who died.

39:57.514 --> 39:58.640
What about Harold?

39:59.316 --> 40:01.807
Harold Krenshaw did something
quite extraordinary.

40:02.485 --> 40:03.884
He found another doctor.

40:05.155 --> 40:06.520
I don't understand.

40:06.590 --> 40:09.753
He wanted you to have these
sessions with me all to yourself.

40:10.527 --> 40:14.088
You have quite a friend there, Adrian.
A friend like that is a blessing.

40:14.164 --> 40:15.153
Harold?

40:15.232 --> 40:17.757
Yeah. Now, as far as
your HMO is concerned,

40:17.834 --> 40:19.961
these sessions are still
technically group sessions.

40:20.036 --> 40:21.765
You'll just be
a group of one.

40:24.140 --> 40:25.471
So let's get started.

40:25.542 --> 40:28.136
Congratulations on
your beating claustrophobia.

40:29.279 --> 40:30.371
I'm proud of you.

40:31.214 --> 40:32.942
So what's next?

40:33.315 --> 40:36.443
Okay. "Death. "

40:37.786 --> 40:38.912
Death?

40:39.822 --> 40:41.187
That's gonna be
a tough one.

40:41.357 --> 40:43.222
Yeah. Could you sit here?

40:43.659 --> 40:44.785
Of course.

40:46.662 --> 40:47.788
Yeah.

40:48.664 --> 40:49.722
And so...

40:50.065 --> 40:51.054
I like this.

40:51.834 --> 40:54.860
I think I should have tried
group therapy a long time ago.

40:57.306 --> 40:58.637
This is a good group.
