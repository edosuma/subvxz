(door thudding)

00:45.079 --> 00:46.979
- Are you okay?

00:46.981 --> 00:48.247
- They got the driver.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.948
They got everybody who
was working tonight.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.350
- Oh, my kids, my kids.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.152
- I know, I'm sorry.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.220
- They kept asking
about the doctors.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.956
I didn't tell them anything.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.092
- Our first night.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.833
(police sirens alarming)

03:24.138 --> 03:24.970
- [Woman] Hell no!

03:24.972 --> 03:26.138
- [Protestors] Don't go!

03:26.140 --> 03:26.939
- [Woman] Hello no!

03:26.941 --> 03:27.773
- [Protestors] Don't go!

03:27.775 --> 03:28.607
- Hell no!

03:28.609 --> 03:29.441
- [Protestors] Don't go!

03:29.443 --> 03:30.275
- Hello no!

03:30.277 --> 03:31.510
- [Protestors] Don't go!

03:31.512 --> 03:33.111
- You can't have
a comfortable life

03:33.113 --> 03:34.546
if you wanna change things.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.848
It can't happen.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.884
You have to be willing
to get arrested.

03:38.886 --> 03:43.088
We have to be willing
to sit in the jail cells

03:43.090 --> 03:45.023
no matter the cost.

03:45.025 --> 03:45.857
- [Woman] Hell no!

03:45.859 --> 03:46.692
- [Protestors] Don't go!

03:46.694 --> 03:47.526
- [Woman] Hell no!

03:47.528 --> 03:48.360
- [Protestors] Don't go!

03:48.362 --> 03:49.194
- Hell no!

03:49.196 --> 03:50.028
- [Protestors] Don't go!

03:50.030 --> 03:50.862
- Hell no!

03:50.864 --> 03:51.697
- [Protestors] Don't go!

03:51.699 --> 03:52.564
- Hell no!

03:52.566 --> 03:53.398
- Hey!

03:53.400 --> 03:54.366
You taking my picture?

03:54.368 --> 03:55.367
What're you working for, huh?

03:55.369 --> 03:56.635
The FBI?

03:56.637 --> 03:59.071
- [Man] Oppression
brick-by-brick.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.539
Rose.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.773
- Yes, Gary?

04:01.775 --> 04:03.809
- Would you mind
getting us some coffee?

04:06.313 --> 04:07.212
- Sure.

04:09.116 --> 04:09.948
- Hell no!

04:09.950 --> 04:10.782
- [Protestors] Don't go!

04:10.784 --> 04:11.617
- Hell no!

04:11.619 --> 04:12.751
- [Protestors] Don't go!

04:12.753 --> 04:13.585
- Hell no.
(camera snapping)

04:13.587 --> 04:16.255
(somber music)

04:27.835 --> 04:29.268
- How's the protest?

04:31.105 --> 04:33.138
- Did Gary make you
get coffee again?

04:33.140 --> 04:34.039
- Yeah.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.275
- It's always the woman.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.877
You notice that?

04:38.879 --> 04:41.913
We go and protest so they
don't have to go to Vietnam.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.148
What do they do for us?

04:48.055 --> 04:48.887
- No, thanks.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.255
I'm gonna go study.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.156
See you later.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.971
(crickets chirping)

05:05.973 --> 05:08.707
(woman gasping)

05:15.883 --> 05:17.215
What happened?

05:19.219 --> 05:20.952
- Can everyone just go?

05:20.954 --> 05:22.537
This is embarrassing.

05:22.538 --> 05:24.121
- I was lying in my bed and
I saw her go in my drawer

05:24.124 --> 05:25.157
and take a razor.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.358
- I needed a razor.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.559
- [Roommate] At
five in the morning?

05:27.561 --> 05:28.627
- Are you okay, Pat?

05:30.230 --> 05:32.264
- She's upset because
she has to drop out.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.332
- Cindy.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.000
- Why does she have to drop out?

05:36.570 --> 05:38.270
- My parents are
really religious.

05:38.272 --> 05:39.805
I can't go home like this.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.708
- So don't go home.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.509
- Where am I gonna go, Janice?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.912
They'll kick me
out of the dorms.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.647
- So get an abortion.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.116
- The mob charges like
three thousand dollars.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.918
My cousin had one
and she almost died.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.287
- I heard about this one
girl who got an abortion

05:55.289 --> 05:57.456
and the guy doing it raped her.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.357
- Marie!

05:59.326 --> 06:00.492
- Can everyone just go?

06:02.296 --> 06:03.161
Please.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.731
- It's fine, I got it.

06:05.733 --> 06:06.998
I'll keep an eye on her.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.518
- [Girl] How do you
know this will work?

06:26.520 --> 06:29.154
- There's this girl in
this book who gets pregnant

06:29.156 --> 06:31.656
and she's supposed to take
rat poison to kill the baby

06:31.658 --> 06:33.692
but she takes too much and dies.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.928
- How do you know you won't die?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.597
- Because in the book
she's only supposed

06:38.599 --> 06:41.800
to take a quarter cup but
she takes a whole cup.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.969
I'm just taking a quarter cup.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.505
- This is scary, Helen.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.641
- You can watch me and make
sure nothing bad happens, okay?

06:49.643 --> 06:51.743
Otherwise, I'll
do this on my own.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.982
- [Girl] Okay.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.490
(somber music)

07:10.330 --> 07:11.797
(knocking)

07:11.799 --> 07:12.931
- Hey, Patty?

07:14.268 --> 07:15.801
- [Patty] Hey.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.436
- Are you going somewhere?

07:17.438 --> 07:20.806
- I talked to my mom, so...

07:20.808 --> 07:22.607
I'm going home.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.544
She said they'd take in the baby

07:25.546 --> 07:27.846
but they aren't paying
for college anymore.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.347
- Oh no, Patty.

07:31.051 --> 07:31.950
- It's okay.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.119
I mean,

07:34.121 --> 07:36.521
it's life,

07:36.523 --> 07:37.422
right?

07:40.093 --> 07:41.827
- Are you sure
you wanna go home?

07:42.830 --> 07:43.895
You could stay.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.571
- College was supposed to
be my way out of there.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.707
But there is just no way out.

08:02.115 --> 08:07.018
- You aren't gonna try
anything when you get home,

08:07.020 --> 08:07.919
are you?

08:09.723 --> 08:10.622
- What?

08:11.425 --> 08:12.891
What did you say?

08:23.170 --> 08:26.404
(phone dial cranking)

08:27.508 --> 08:30.141
(somber music)

08:35.415 --> 08:36.515
- Hello, Nancy?

08:38.652 --> 08:41.520
Hi, it's Rose from Biology.

08:44.091 --> 08:44.990
Uuuh...

08:47.127 --> 08:48.560
I know you were in nursing.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.899
Do you know anyone
who does abortions?

08:55.369 --> 08:57.869
Real doctors, no mob guys.

09:03.143 --> 09:07.546
Okay.

09:07.548 --> 09:08.914
Thank you.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.550
(somber music)

09:15.188 --> 09:16.221
Is that okay?

09:18.258 --> 09:21.226
Can you wait a day or
two before you go home

09:21.228 --> 09:23.061
just to see if we
can find someone?

09:27.501 --> 09:30.569
(crickets chirping)

09:39.780 --> 09:42.514
(phone ringing)

09:43.850 --> 09:44.749
Hello?

09:45.819 --> 09:47.252
Yes, yes, this is.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.491
Okay.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.460
Mm-hmm.

09:58.332 --> 10:00.966
(somber music)

10:02.336 --> 10:04.803
Yes, we can pay that.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.105
(knocking)

10:18.885 --> 10:19.985
Do you think we
could get together

10:19.987 --> 10:21.553
a thousand dollars for Patty?

10:24.758 --> 10:25.590
- By when?

10:25.592 --> 10:26.491
- Tomorrow.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.029
- Let's see who's awake.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.702
(knocking)

10:42.976 --> 10:44.025
- Oh.

10:44.026 --> 10:45.075
Which one of you is
the one that called?

10:45.078 --> 10:45.910
- Oh,

10:45.912 --> 10:47.212
me.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.080
- I told you to come
alone into the back.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.248
- No you didn't.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.349
- If there's more
than three people

10:51.351 --> 10:53.218
in a room discussing abortion,

10:53.220 --> 10:55.420
it's conspiracy to commit murder

10:55.422 --> 10:56.621
which is a far more
serious charge.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.722
Do you understand?

10:58.725 --> 11:00.525
- We can wait outside.

11:00.527 --> 11:01.359
- It's too late now.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.594
Come on in.

11:02.596 --> 11:03.928
Come on in, come on in.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.338
(sighing)

11:17.611 --> 11:20.045
- Do you think
he's a real doctor?

11:20.047 --> 11:22.080
- This is a doctor's office.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.716
- Yeah but it could be someone
else's and he might sneak in.

11:25.585 --> 11:26.785
- No, stop it.

11:27.854 --> 11:28.753
No.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.464
(sighing)

11:39.466 --> 11:40.632
- In a couple of days,

11:40.634 --> 11:42.567
you'll notice a heavier
flow than usual.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.969
That's the miscarriage.

11:44.971 --> 11:48.006
Any fever, any
infection, call me.

11:50.177 --> 11:53.078
Now, you ladies need to start
keeping your legs together.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.382
This wild behavior
just leads to trouble.

11:58.752 --> 12:01.419
- Doctor, if we had any other
friends that needed this,

12:01.421 --> 12:02.654
can we give you a call?

12:02.656 --> 12:05.123
- I don't wanna see
any of you ever again.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.024
- Okay.

12:07.594 --> 12:08.727
Thank you, doctor.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.596
- Stop.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.765
The back door is that way.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.500
- [Patty] Thank you.

12:17.537 --> 12:20.939
(somber music)

12:20.941 --> 12:23.808
(school bell ringing)

12:23.810 --> 12:26.010
- [Man] I don't understand
what you're asking.

12:26.012 --> 12:29.347
- I want to take over the sex
education program, update it.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.548
Clearly our kids aren't getting

12:30.550 --> 12:32.317
the basic information
that they need.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.551
- Such as what, exactly?

12:33.553 --> 12:36.020
What basic information
does someone need at 15?

12:36.022 --> 12:37.822
- Birth control?

12:37.824 --> 12:40.158
We just had a student die
from drinking rat poison.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.526
- No.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.461
We don't know that
she was pregnant.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.395
- Her friend said--

12:44.397 --> 12:46.097
- I know what her friends said.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.967
I also know that Sister
Ann Marie has been doing

12:48.969 --> 12:51.136
our health eduction
program for 30 years

12:51.138 --> 12:53.138
and in all that
time we have not had

12:53.140 --> 12:54.572
one complaint from a parent.

12:54.574 --> 12:55.807
Not

12:55.809 --> 12:56.841
one

12:56.843 --> 12:58.376
complaint.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.945
(somber music)

13:02.082 --> 13:03.915
- So the first thing
Sister Ann Marie does

13:03.917 --> 13:06.084
is to separate the
boys from the girls

13:06.086 --> 13:07.385
and then she talks to the girls

13:07.387 --> 13:09.254
about how they have to
protect their virtue

13:09.256 --> 13:11.322
so they can save the boys' souls

13:11.324 --> 13:13.725
and then just moves on to
cleanliness during your period.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.096
Just makes me crazy.

13:18.097 --> 13:19.263
- You should just hide a
pamphlet about birth control

13:19.266 --> 13:20.431
in the school library.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.168
- It's hard enough hiding you.

13:26.840 --> 13:27.739
- Oh, here.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.574
Let me help you with that.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.409
- Oh, thank you.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.279
- I saw you at the
meeting last week.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.115
- Gary's pretty passionate.

13:37.117 --> 13:40.718
- Yeah, he's got some
pretty interesting ideas.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.053
But I don't think we're
gonna get anywhere

13:42.055 --> 13:43.588
with burning things down.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.456
- Doesn't seem practical.
- No.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.624
I'm Bill, by the way.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.726
O'Brien.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.328
(chuckling)

13:50.330 --> 13:51.830
- Rose.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.364
History.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.465
History major.

13:55.702 --> 13:58.603
(laughing)

13:58.605 --> 14:01.039
- So how would you feel about

14:01.041 --> 14:03.474
going to grab some
coffee sometime?

14:05.111 --> 14:06.277
Well,

14:06.279 --> 14:08.546
it doesn't have to be coffee.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.614
- Well, in that case,

14:09.616 --> 14:12.417
(laughing)
yeah, that'd be great.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.519
- Doesn't have to be coffee.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.589
(water tricking)

14:17.591 --> 14:19.891
(knocking)

14:28.668 --> 14:30.368
- Are you okay?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.003
- Yeah.

14:32.005 --> 14:32.904
Not pregnant.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.876
It took two days for it to
happen like the doctor said.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.712
(dramatic music)

14:42.382 --> 14:43.214
(crying)

14:43.216 --> 14:44.949
- [Cindy] It's okay.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.787
- I'm just so happy
to have my life back.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.295
- I need the number.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.631
- What number?

14:59.633 --> 15:00.498
- For the doctor.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.700
I wanna give it to all
the women in the dorm

15:02.702 --> 15:03.968
in case they need it.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.336
- But he said not
to call him again.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.205
- He won't know that we're
the ones that gave it out.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.539
Just in case they need help.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.208
- I don't think we should
give out his phone number

15:10.210 --> 15:12.377
without warning people
he might get mad.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.213
- So you're okay with women
just dying because they don't--

15:15.215 --> 15:16.781
- Of course not.

15:16.783 --> 15:20.018
But he could report
us to the school.

15:20.020 --> 15:20.919
- So what?

15:22.055 --> 15:23.755
- We have to think
of something else.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.224
- Ugh.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.865
- [Man] You did this on purpose.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.800
- You really think I
would do this on purpose?

15:35.802 --> 15:37.435
- That's what women do, okay?

15:37.437 --> 15:40.138
They want a guy to marry
them, they'll do anything.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.540
- Why the hell would
I want to marry you?

15:42.542 --> 15:45.176
- Fuck you, Barb, okay?

15:45.178 --> 15:46.811
Why don't you just put
it up for adoption?

15:46.813 --> 15:48.913
- I can't, that
would kill my mother.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.415
- [Man] Then don't tell her.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.717
- What, you want me to not
see her for six months?

15:56.589 --> 15:58.089
- So get an abortion.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.058
- What, you think I just
have an abortion doctor's

16:00.060 --> 16:01.359
number just lying around?

16:03.029 --> 16:05.897
- I'm not gonna
marry you, okay?!

16:05.899 --> 16:08.566
That's the one thing I'm
for sure as hell not doing!

16:12.105 --> 16:14.772
(somber music)

16:22.949 --> 16:23.781
- You two coming?

16:23.783 --> 16:24.615
- Yeah.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.150
Oh, no,

16:26.152 --> 16:27.518
we're organizing a walkout
tonight at the law school.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.519
- Yeah?

16:28.521 --> 16:29.420
- Yeah.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.622
Yeah.
- Yeah?

16:31.624 --> 16:32.623
- Okay.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.025
See you there, Rose.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.227
- I'm coming.

16:43.236 --> 16:46.204
- Good thing you have that
abortion doctor's phone number.

16:47.040 --> 16:47.905
- For Bill?

16:49.009 --> 16:50.842
He's Catholic.

16:50.844 --> 16:51.876
- How Catholic?

16:52.712 --> 16:54.412
- I don't know.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.414
We've only been on three dates.

16:56.416 --> 16:59.617
- You two are gonna get
married and move to the suburbs

16:59.619 --> 17:00.985
and have a bunch of babies.

17:02.989 --> 17:03.921
Aren't you?

17:03.923 --> 17:04.822
- No.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.492
Maybe.

17:12.766 --> 17:15.633
What if I did it from my room?

17:15.635 --> 17:16.968
- Had sex?

17:16.970 --> 17:18.469
- No.

17:18.471 --> 17:23.007
What if we had women call my
dorm room for an abortion?

17:23.009 --> 17:25.143
We give out my phone number.

17:25.145 --> 17:28.913
And we can tell them
to ask for Jane.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.882
So my name wouldn't
be attached to it.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.352
No one in the dorm
is named Jane, right?

17:34.354 --> 17:35.520
It would be anonymous.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.023
- Jane Doe.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.725
- And then I could
explain about the doctor

17:40.727 --> 17:42.326
and what to do and stuff.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.764
- You would do that
from your dorm room?

17:46.766 --> 17:48.933
- Just for other students.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.102
It would only be a couple
of calls a year, right?

17:53.073 --> 17:56.307
(somber guitar music)

18:02.715 --> 18:05.249
You have to go, you're
not supposed to be here.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.018
- I have to go, I'm not
supposed to be here.

18:07.020 --> 18:10.088
(chuckling)

18:10.090 --> 18:13.157
Hey, can I drive you
home after break?

18:13.159 --> 18:15.726
You know, I'd cut through
on my way to the east coast

18:15.728 --> 18:17.261
and meet your mom.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.030
(laughing)

18:19.032 --> 18:20.465
- That's a long way
out of your way.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.200
- Yeah, I know.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.801
Just...

18:23.803 --> 18:26.504
You know, I was also
thinking that maybe we oughta

18:26.506 --> 18:27.805
get married sometime.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.545
- We've only been
dating for a few months.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.613
- I know.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.249
Just thought I'd ask.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.852
In case you met some cute
farmer over the break.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.923
You can say no.

18:49.829 --> 18:50.728
- Maybe.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.033
Just don't tell my
mom about this, okay?

18:56.035 --> 18:58.169
It would be just between us.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.003
- Why?

18:59.005 --> 19:00.271
I'm respectable.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.306
(chuckling)

19:02.308 --> 19:05.042
(phone ringing)

19:06.913 --> 19:07.812
- Hello?

19:10.150 --> 19:11.516
Yes, this is.

19:12.752 --> 19:13.651
Hold on.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.322
You have to go.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.690
I'm sorry.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.558
- Right now?

19:21.628 --> 19:22.860
- This is private.

19:24.564 --> 19:25.463
I'm really sorry.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.265
- Rose.

19:39.445 --> 19:40.344
- This is Jane.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.650
- [Janice] You have to tell him.

19:45.652 --> 19:46.551
- No I don't.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.187
I'll graduate in a few months

19:49.189 --> 19:51.189
and we'll hand it
off to someone else.

19:52.859 --> 19:53.758
- Who?

19:55.728 --> 19:57.495
- Janice, where are your bags?

19:57.497 --> 20:00.231
We have to beat traffic so
we can get to the airport.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.200
- [Janice] Just a sec, Mom.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.202
- That that what you're
wearing for the trip?

20:04.204 --> 20:05.503
Let me look at your hair.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.373
- Oh, you cut it yourself.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.911
- Have a good Thanksgiving.

20:13.913 --> 20:14.812
- Kill me now.

20:20.186 --> 20:23.421
(upbeat guitar music)

20:30.663 --> 20:31.562
- [Bill] Wow.

20:32.632 --> 20:35.166
Looks like a movie
set from 1920.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.502
- [Rose] That's pretty much
what it's like to live here.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.940
- So, Rose,

20:44.811 --> 20:45.710
over the break,

20:47.247 --> 20:49.914
how would you feel if
I picked up some kinda

20:51.384 --> 20:54.518
birth control, condoms or...

20:54.520 --> 20:56.520
I don't wanna pressure
you or anything.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.189
- Me, you're the Catholic one.

20:58.191 --> 21:00.424
- What? We're engaged.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.692
Close enough, right?

21:01.694 --> 21:03.661
I just thought--

21:03.663 --> 21:05.997
- I mean, I can too.

21:05.999 --> 21:09.600
I mean, I can look into
finding some kind of--

21:09.602 --> 21:10.868
- [Bill] Oh, there's your mom.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.150
- Oh, you're home!

21:26.152 --> 21:29.153
(chuckling)

21:29.155 --> 21:32.556
And this must be the nice
young man who gave you a ride.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.325
- Yes, Mom, this is Bill.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.460
- Well, come on in, we'll
get you a cup of coffee.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.395
Where you headed?

21:37.397 --> 21:38.496
- Pittsburgh area.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.964
- Oh, well, we won't
keep you too long.

21:50.209 --> 21:53.878
(crickets chirping)

21:53.880 --> 21:56.213
- You couldn't invited
him to stay for dinner.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.783
- If I had invited
him to dinner,

21:58.785 --> 22:01.252
I would have had to invited
him to stay the night.

22:01.254 --> 22:02.820
He's not staying
under the same roof

22:02.822 --> 22:05.156
as my unmarried daughter.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.992
- It's almost 1969.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.960
- He seems like a
very nice young man.

22:11.698 --> 22:14.665
I would have no problem if
you married him at some point.

22:16.235 --> 22:18.135
But you know how
these things go.

22:18.137 --> 22:20.237
- No, Mom, how do they go?

22:20.239 --> 22:21.739
- You marry and have children

22:21.741 --> 22:25.142
and the last thing on your
mind will be your own career.

22:25.144 --> 22:27.578
And I want you to be
able to support yourself.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.681
When your father died...

22:34.053 --> 22:36.387
I had a very tough time.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.856
You can postpone all of that

22:38.858 --> 22:39.924
as long as possible.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.532
- I'm engaged, Mom.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.620
(knocking)

23:09.622 --> 23:11.789
So I've gotten engaged.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.557
- Congratulations.

23:13.559 --> 23:16.127
- And I was just wondering

23:16.129 --> 23:20.564
if you would be willing
to write me a prescription

23:20.566 --> 23:22.466
for birth control.

23:22.468 --> 23:23.401
- Oh, I see.

23:24.504 --> 23:28.038
Well, I appreciate the honesty

23:28.040 --> 23:29.640
but until you're
actually married,

23:29.642 --> 23:32.410
I'm afraid I wouldn't be
comfortable doing that.

23:32.412 --> 23:36.647
- But we haven't done anything.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.883
I'm just trying to be careful.

23:38.885 --> 23:41.419
- I think the best
thing to do is to pray

23:41.421 --> 23:43.187
and if you really
can't control yourself,

23:43.189 --> 23:45.623
you can always move up
the date of the wedding.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.058
- I know.

23:48.060 --> 23:52.963
I just wanted to become a
teacher before I have children.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.967
I mean, I want children,
just not right now.

23:56.969 --> 23:59.270
- Well, these things
work in mysterious ways

23:59.272 --> 24:00.905
and you may change
your feels about--

24:00.907 --> 24:03.808
- Dr. Johnson, I'm 22 years old.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.178
That's older than my mom
was when she married my dad.

24:07.180 --> 24:08.345
- So?

24:08.347 --> 24:09.814
- So,

24:09.816 --> 24:12.683
if I was married and
I asked for the pill,

24:12.685 --> 24:14.151
would you give it to me?

24:14.153 --> 24:18.155
- I would if you had your
husband's permission.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.499
(upbeat music)

24:36.509 --> 24:38.042
- Tim.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.777
Tim, come here for a photo.

24:39.779 --> 24:40.878
- Just give me a minute.

24:47.420 --> 24:48.919
- [Man] If I knew
what was going on,

24:48.921 --> 24:52.990
I would've had you move
up the day of the wedding.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.158
- Sorry, Dad.

24:58.130 --> 24:59.296
- Tim.

24:59.298 --> 25:02.132
Let's do a photo
with the ladies, huh?

25:05.371 --> 25:06.937
- If I had known
what was going on,

25:06.939 --> 25:10.174
I would've helped
you get an abortion.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.580
- That's it.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.517
Smile now.

25:27.994 --> 25:33.063
¶ You don't have to be afraid ¶

25:33.900 --> 25:35.933
¶ I want you to dance, baby ¶

25:35.935 --> 25:39.169
(school bell ringing)

25:45.444 --> 25:48.178
(phone ringing)

25:51.217 --> 25:52.149
(Rose groaning)

25:52.151 --> 25:53.050
- Hello?

25:56.255 --> 25:58.522
This is Jane, let me
get you the number.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.126
What?

26:05.965 --> 26:08.599
Well, if you don't know if you
want to go through with it,

26:08.601 --> 26:10.367
just call me back
when you decide.

26:13.806 --> 26:14.872
Hello?

26:21.147 --> 26:23.881
(phone ringing)

26:25.685 --> 26:26.584
Hello?

26:29.121 --> 26:30.588
Sure.

26:30.590 --> 26:33.457
Sure, you can tell me what
happened with your boyfriend.

26:33.459 --> 26:34.391
Go ahead.

26:35.528 --> 26:38.362
(birds chirping)

26:44.971 --> 26:46.370
- You're unemployed.

26:46.372 --> 26:47.871
- So?

26:47.873 --> 26:50.307
You're not gonna have sex with
me again until I get a job?

26:50.309 --> 26:53.243
(giggling)

26:53.245 --> 26:56.614
- I just think we should
use some kind of protection,

26:56.616 --> 26:58.649
if we know we can't
afford another kid.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.120
(groaning)

27:09.061 --> 27:10.260
- [Man] Ha, ha, ha.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.665
(humming tune)

27:14.667 --> 27:16.767
- How old is that thing?

27:16.769 --> 27:19.136
It looks like it's from
before Wally was born.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.006
- You're hurting
my feelings here.

27:22.008 --> 27:22.806
Come on.

27:22.808 --> 27:23.874
- Oh.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.476
No.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.343
- Why not?

27:26.345 --> 27:27.645
(laughing)

27:27.647 --> 27:28.545
Mmmmm.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.549
(pleasant music)

27:36.856 --> 27:39.690
- I'm just glad they
made it out in one piece.

27:40.926 --> 27:44.161
All the riots and the
Democratic convention last year,

27:44.163 --> 27:47.398
I wouldn't want to be anywhere
near a big city right now.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.533
- I set up a savings
account for Janice

27:49.535 --> 27:51.869
just in case she needs bail.

27:51.871 --> 27:52.936
- Hey, where's Rose?

27:55.341 --> 27:56.573
- I'll go get her.

27:56.575 --> 27:58.509
- Tell her she's the
reason I'm graduating.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.044
- Oh, really?

28:01.280 --> 28:02.746
Why is that?

28:02.748 --> 28:03.647
- Uuuh.

28:04.617 --> 28:06.283
- Yes, I know it's a lot.

28:06.285 --> 28:07.785
Sometimes they'll do it for less

28:07.787 --> 28:10.220
but you have to give them a
sad story when you get there.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.822
Just bring as much
money as you have

28:11.824 --> 28:14.792
and I'll call and
followup afterwards, okay?

28:14.794 --> 28:17.561
Okay, I have to go
graduate from college.

28:17.563 --> 28:19.530
But let me know
how it goes, okay?

28:22.501 --> 28:23.934
- How much longer are
you gonna do this?

28:23.936 --> 28:25.469
When do you move out?

28:25.471 --> 28:26.470
- On Friday.

28:27.606 --> 28:29.273
- [Janice] Who's
taking it over for you?

28:30.109 --> 28:31.542
- I don't know.

28:31.544 --> 28:34.111
I mean, I'm sometimes
getting three calls a night.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.413
Who can I hand that off to?

28:37.550 --> 28:39.149
It isn't even just
students anymore.

28:42.121 --> 28:43.620
- You know who we should ask.

28:45.825 --> 28:50.227
- I want us to put
concrete stuff into action.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.428
- Hey, Gary.
- Yeah?

28:51.430 --> 28:53.363
- Rose has some
suggestions for that.

28:55.134 --> 28:58.969
- We were thinking we should
put abortion on the platform.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.572
- Yeah, that's...

29:02.374 --> 29:05.609
Like, our focus is on Vietnam

29:05.611 --> 29:06.810
and the police state

29:06.812 --> 29:09.246
and things where people
are literally dying.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.748
- People die from abortions.

29:12.051 --> 29:15.953
- The things is, I've been
helping women from my dorm room

29:15.955 --> 29:17.888
and I was thinking now
that I'm graduating,

29:17.890 --> 29:20.524
maybe this group could
help take it over.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.092
- Take it over how?

29:22.094 --> 29:23.293
- Do it!

29:23.295 --> 29:25.262
You want ways for direct
action, this is it.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.132
- Yeah.

29:28.134 --> 29:29.066
That's...

29:29.068 --> 29:30.000
Yeah.

29:30.002 --> 29:30.834
Yeah.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.035
You know what,

29:32.037 --> 29:34.304
let's put it on the agenda.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.007
- Fuck him!

29:37.009 --> 29:39.510
You know, if there had been
a female leader in there,

29:39.512 --> 29:41.044
this wouldn't have happened.

29:41.046 --> 29:42.746
They would've
taken us seriously.

29:46.585 --> 29:47.484
Why are you being quiet?

29:47.486 --> 29:48.418
Aren't you upset?

29:49.755 --> 29:52.189
- Where are we gonna find
a tough female leader?

29:53.726 --> 29:54.958
- Me?

29:54.960 --> 29:55.893
Are you crazy?

29:55.895 --> 29:57.494
I get in trouble all the time.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.063
- I know.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.978
- It's entirely possible
no one will show up.

31:20.980 --> 31:21.879
- I know.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.349
- On the other hand, if
more than three people come

31:25.351 --> 31:26.617
and we're discussing abortion,

31:26.619 --> 31:28.485
that's conspiracy
to commit murder.

31:30.856 --> 31:31.722
- I know.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.510
- Baby's asleep, so I'm
gonna go out for a bit.

31:53.512 --> 31:54.711
- No you're not, I'm going out.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.713
- I'll be back soon, I haven't
been out in like two months.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.982
- Hey, I said you're
not going out.

31:58.984 --> 31:59.917
Hey!

31:59.919 --> 32:00.951
- You're gonna wake the baby.

32:02.421 --> 32:03.520
- Hey, Barb!

32:04.356 --> 32:06.924
(baby crying)

32:10.529 --> 32:13.430
- Hi, we called
this meeting because

32:13.432 --> 32:15.933
we want to get organized.

32:15.935 --> 32:17.901
- We believe in
women's liberation

32:17.903 --> 32:20.137
and we think that women will
never be fully liberated

32:20.139 --> 32:23.106
unless they can control whether
and when they get pregnant.

32:23.108 --> 32:26.043
That's what this
meeting's about, abortion,

32:27.179 --> 32:28.712
so if anyone has a
problem with that,

32:28.714 --> 32:30.280
you should probably leave now.

32:31.083 --> 32:33.884
- We're going to do abortions.

32:33.886 --> 32:35.185
- No, no.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.187
- We are going to
create a service

32:37.189 --> 32:40.290
so that any woman who needs
an abortion can get one.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.527
- We want to compile
a list of doctors.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.963
- Right and if any of the
doctors from that list

32:45.965 --> 32:49.499
treat women poorly or
give them a hard time,

32:49.501 --> 32:50.767
they get struck from the list.

32:50.769 --> 32:54.071
- But won't we get
in trouble for this?

32:54.073 --> 32:55.672
- Potentially.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.708
- So, as long as
you're doing anything

32:57.710 --> 33:00.410
for this organization,

33:00.412 --> 33:02.446
you will be referred to as Jane.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.182
There are no Janes
in room, right?

33:06.986 --> 33:09.019
- How do you know you're
gonna find real doctors?

33:09.021 --> 33:10.320
- We'll hold interviews.

33:11.423 --> 33:14.024
But right now I've
only got two names.

33:14.026 --> 33:18.695
So we need you guys to start
collecting every name you can.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.164
Do any of you know anyone
who's had an abortion?

33:27.539 --> 33:29.606
- Would you mind asking?

33:34.046 --> 33:35.746
- How're you doing?

33:35.748 --> 33:36.713
Was that okay?

33:38.050 --> 33:39.950
- It was good.

33:39.952 --> 33:41.084
- What is it?

33:47.026 --> 33:48.759
- How do you feel
about abortion?

33:51.930 --> 33:52.829
- Why?

33:54.366 --> 33:58.201
If you got pregnant, we could
get married sooner and--

33:58.203 --> 33:59.202
- No, I meant that's what...

34:02.941 --> 34:05.375
The phone calls to
my room in college,

34:07.613 --> 34:09.579
it was women looking
for an abortion.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.750
I have the number of
an abortion doctor.

34:16.955 --> 34:19.022
I knew you were Catholic so
I was afraid to tell you.

34:19.024 --> 34:20.290
- Why, did you have one?

34:21.427 --> 34:22.292
- Me, no.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.897
I found someone for a friend.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.901
But I want to keep being
involved with that.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.740
- You could get in
trouble for this.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.142
- Possibly.

34:40.379 --> 34:42.245
- Rose, I love you

34:42.247 --> 34:45.382
and I respect that you're
trying to help people

34:45.384 --> 34:47.818
but this is your whole life
you're putting at risk.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.253
- I know but...

34:51.323 --> 34:53.657
I feel like it's my
responsibility to help.

34:55.794 --> 34:58.195
- Can you promise me you'll
quit when we get married?

35:01.567 --> 35:02.466
- I don't know.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.869
- I mean, I wanna run for office

35:05.871 --> 35:08.638
and this is a team
effort here, you and me.

35:08.640 --> 35:11.475
(dramatic music)

35:15.147 --> 35:16.046
- Okay.

35:19.051 --> 35:21.852
Okay, I'll quit once they're
able to do stuff without me.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.134
- What do you think?

35:37.136 --> 35:39.970
- Well, I think it's illegal.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.638
- You could lose your job.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.773
- Yeah, if I walk
around asking everyone

35:43.775 --> 35:45.809
for the name of a
good abortion doctor.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.345
- Right, so,

35:48.347 --> 35:50.780
does that mean you
don't wanna help them?

35:50.782 --> 35:53.116
Cause I wanna help them.

35:53.118 --> 35:54.618
- It's not that I
don't wanna help.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.452
I just--

35:55.454 --> 35:56.520
- 'Cause I had one.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.724
Once, when I was 17

36:02.294 --> 36:06.163
and the guy took all the
money that I had and...

36:09.067 --> 36:09.966
- [Donna] What?

36:11.103 --> 36:13.837
- And I almost died
from the infection

36:13.839 --> 36:17.274
and now I don't know if
I can even have kids.

36:17.276 --> 36:21.244
And I don't know if
I even want kids but

36:23.282 --> 36:25.315
that guy took that
from me, you know?

36:32.124 --> 36:34.524
(men whispering)

36:44.636 --> 36:45.468
- [Man] Hey, honey.

36:48.907 --> 36:49.956
- Hi.

36:49.957 --> 36:51.006
- So they're discussing
what they can do.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.711
The tumor is in exactly
the wrong place.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.612
- I know.

36:57.149 --> 36:58.048
- So,

36:59.985 --> 37:02.652
they're afraid that anything
they do to remove it might

37:03.789 --> 37:05.822
cause you to lose the baby.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.525
- But if they don't do
anything I could die.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.597
Well did you tell them that
I have two kids at home

37:13.599 --> 37:14.831
and that I want to live?

37:14.833 --> 37:16.399
- Yes but it's hard
to talk to them,

37:16.401 --> 37:17.701
they don't wanna take the risk.

37:17.703 --> 37:19.202
- Excuse me?

37:19.204 --> 37:20.637
Excuse me?!

37:20.639 --> 37:22.105
I want you to do it.

37:22.107 --> 37:23.206
I used to be a nurse.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.674
I understand that there's a risk

37:24.676 --> 37:27.177
that I will lose
the pregnancy but

37:27.179 --> 37:29.246
I have two kids at home

37:29.248 --> 37:30.747
and I need to be there for them.

37:30.749 --> 37:31.948
So please?

37:33.518 --> 37:35.185
Please, just operate.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.955
- We'd like to speak with
your husband outside.

37:41.093 --> 37:42.158
- It's okay.

37:51.737 --> 37:54.137
(muttering)

37:56.041 --> 37:57.507
- Here you go.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.643
Literally everyone I know
thinks I'm pregnant right now.

38:01.213 --> 38:02.812
- Thank you.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.080
- And here's mine.

38:04.082 --> 38:04.981
- Thanks, Barb.

38:06.551 --> 38:07.817
- Six names.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.387
Anyone else?

38:12.090 --> 38:13.657
Think that's enough start?

38:15.227 --> 38:16.293
-Has to be, right?

38:17.562 --> 38:20.130
(upbeat guitar music)

38:26.805 --> 38:28.171
- You're Jane?

38:28.173 --> 38:29.072
- We both are.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.275
- You're both Jane?

38:32.277 --> 38:33.743
- I'm not comfortable
with the idea

38:33.745 --> 38:36.179
that you're gonna use me so you
can go out and get pregnant.

38:36.181 --> 38:38.548
- No, no, no, it's not for us.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.217
- Abortion is a serious
procedure and it's a crime.

38:41.219 --> 38:42.652
I mean, why would
you look for a doctor

38:42.654 --> 38:43.987
before you got pregnant?

38:43.989 --> 38:46.589
- So, do you have
your medical license?

38:46.591 --> 38:47.691
- Excuse me?

38:47.693 --> 38:50.060
- Your medical
license, we just need--

38:50.062 --> 38:52.295
- I'm the one who
interviews the girls,

38:52.297 --> 38:54.831
they don't interview
me, you understand?

38:54.833 --> 38:57.200
- We're not planning
on getting pregnant.

38:57.202 --> 38:58.268
- [Doctor] Who is?

38:58.270 --> 38:59.502
- No one.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.905
No one is planning
to get an abortion.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.674
- I've had it with
this, get out.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.277
- But if someone didn't
plan of getting pregnant

39:07.279 --> 39:09.512
and their birth control failed,

39:09.514 --> 39:11.348
isn't it better that
they come in right away

39:11.350 --> 39:13.883
instead if trying it home
alone with a coat hanger?

39:13.885 --> 39:15.518
- Which is why I
agreed to do these

39:15.520 --> 39:18.154
because I've stitched up
women who've almost died.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.557
Do you understand?

39:20.559 --> 39:22.058
- Yes, but we're just--

39:22.060 --> 39:24.828
- I take you or I don't
and I charge what I want.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.130
That's the way I do things.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.968
- Then you're not the
right person for us.

39:33.372 --> 39:36.606
(upbeat guitar music)

39:39.711 --> 39:41.911
- So can we add your
name to our list?

39:47.686 --> 39:50.086
(chuckling)

39:56.862 --> 40:00.029
- I haven't lost a
patient yet, not one.

40:00.031 --> 40:00.897
- That's good.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.601
- If somebody says that
anybody died under my care,

40:04.603 --> 40:05.702
they're lying.

40:09.674 --> 40:10.573
- Thank you.

40:11.443 --> 40:12.842
We'll be in touch.

40:12.844 --> 40:14.210
We don't have
anyone lined up yet.

40:14.212 --> 40:15.111
- Wait a minute,

40:16.047 --> 40:18.081
you guys wasting my time?

40:18.083 --> 40:19.616
Which one of you is pregnant?

40:20.552 --> 40:22.452
- No, like I said on the phone.

40:22.454 --> 40:24.354
- Are you guys working
for the police?

40:24.356 --> 40:25.672
- No.

40:25.673 --> 40:26.989
- Are you working for the
police because if you are,

40:26.992 --> 40:28.825
I will fucking kill you!

40:28.827 --> 40:33.363
I will find out where you live
and I will fucking kill you!

40:33.365 --> 40:36.332
(exciting guitar music)

40:36.334 --> 40:37.300
- Okay!

40:37.302 --> 40:38.168
Okay!

40:40.071 --> 40:41.938
- Get out of the
fucking car right now!

40:41.940 --> 40:42.772
You better not--

40:42.774 --> 40:44.140
- Go away!

40:44.142 --> 40:45.041
(engine rumbling)

40:45.043 --> 40:45.875
- Oh no you don't!

40:45.877 --> 40:47.043
You ain't fucking!

40:47.045 --> 40:48.178
(horn honking)
Get out!

40:48.180 --> 40:49.579
Get out of the car!

40:49.581 --> 40:50.814
(horn honking)

40:50.816 --> 40:52.982
- Hey, you don't like cops?!

40:52.984 --> 40:54.217
Someone is gonna call the cops

40:54.219 --> 40:55.552
if you don't get the hell away!

40:55.554 --> 40:57.987
(horn honking)

40:57.989 --> 40:58.955
- [Doctor] I'm gonna find you

40:58.957 --> 41:01.224
and I'm gonna fucking kill you!

41:01.226 --> 41:04.461
(upbeat guitar music)

41:15.974 --> 41:17.140
- He didn't follow us.

41:23.248 --> 41:26.649
- He could call and try
to track the phone number.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.184
- Rose, I'm from
New York, all right?

41:28.186 --> 41:29.552
People who make big
threats like that

41:29.554 --> 41:31.754
is because they can't
actually do anything.

41:33.625 --> 41:36.259
(somber music)

41:43.034 --> 41:44.167
- I'm scared.

41:46.304 --> 41:47.937
- Yeah, me too.

41:47.939 --> 41:50.940
So there are three doctors
willing to work with us.

41:50.942 --> 41:53.009
What're their prices again?

41:53.011 --> 41:56.446
- One thousand, 800 and 750.

41:56.448 --> 41:57.847
- That's a year's rent.

41:58.917 --> 41:59.883
- It's extortion.

42:01.453 --> 42:04.120
(somber music)

42:11.963 --> 42:13.162
- You girls okay?

42:13.164 --> 42:15.331
- Yes, thank you.
- Yes, thanks.

42:18.970 --> 42:21.638
(somber music)

42:27.646 --> 42:30.580
- How're you beautiful
ladies doing tonight?

42:30.582 --> 42:31.648
- We're not interested.

42:31.650 --> 42:33.583
- Interested in what?

42:33.585 --> 42:35.118
- Whatever it is you're selling.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.086
(laughing)

42:37.088 --> 42:38.555
- Is either one of you Jane?

42:40.425 --> 42:41.524
- Are you the doctor?

42:42.460 --> 42:43.359
- Yeah.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.362
- You're the doctor?

42:46.364 --> 42:47.964
- Me, yeah.

42:47.966 --> 42:50.166
Got my medical license
and everything.

43:04.249 --> 43:05.381
I've been doing a lot of these

43:05.383 --> 43:07.050
since my medical
practice got shut down.

43:07.052 --> 43:08.718
- Why did your medical
practice get shut down?

43:08.720 --> 43:10.620
- Because I was
doing a lot of these.

43:10.622 --> 43:12.488
- How did you get into this?

43:12.490 --> 43:13.723
- Money was good.

43:13.725 --> 43:15.325
I live in a town where
my regular practice

43:15.327 --> 43:17.293
could barley keep a
roof over my head,

43:18.396 --> 43:21.497
so I did a few of
these, I got busted,

43:21.499 --> 43:23.800
don't worry, I'm much better
at keeping it a secret now.

43:23.802 --> 43:27.370
- How much would
you charge, mister--

43:27.372 --> 43:29.672
- Charlie, Doctor Charlie.

43:29.674 --> 43:30.907
- Well, because Dr. Charlie,

43:30.909 --> 43:33.042
we can't pay very much.

43:33.545 --> 43:34.944
- How many girls you
think it will be?

43:34.946 --> 43:36.179
A couple a month?

43:36.181 --> 43:38.915
- We're not sure but
it could be as high as

43:38.917 --> 43:40.750
two or three a week.

43:40.752 --> 43:43.286
- A week.

43:45.056 --> 43:46.055
I can do 500.

43:47.993 --> 43:49.592
You girls are awful organized.

43:49.594 --> 43:50.593
Are you hookers?

43:52.597 --> 43:53.563
- No.

43:53.564 --> 43:54.530
We just believe it's
the right thing to do.

43:54.532 --> 43:55.431
- Oh,

43:56.501 --> 43:58.468
are you women's
libbers or something?

43:59.337 --> 44:00.169
- Yeah.

44:01.106 --> 44:02.672
You got a problem with that?

44:02.674 --> 44:06.142
- I don't have a problem
with anything you do.

44:06.144 --> 44:08.811
(somber music)

44:11.249 --> 44:12.181
- What is it?

44:12.183 --> 44:13.483
- Since I work at a coffee shop,

44:13.485 --> 44:15.518
I can't always be
here during the day,

44:15.520 --> 44:18.254
so I got a second phone line
installed it in my apartment.

44:18.256 --> 44:20.256
This is an answering machine.

44:20.258 --> 44:22.058
People call in and
then a voice tells them

44:22.060 --> 44:24.160
to leave a message
and then they talk.

44:25.230 --> 44:26.129
- A voice.

44:27.866 --> 44:29.832
(clicking)

44:29.834 --> 44:31.234
- [Rose Recording] Hi,
you've reached Jane

44:31.236 --> 44:32.969
at "Women's Liberation."

44:32.971 --> 44:35.238
Please leave a phone number
where you can be reached

44:35.240 --> 44:38.574
along with good times to call
and any other instructions

44:38.576 --> 44:40.543
or information we
might need to know

44:40.545 --> 44:42.345
immediately following
this message.

44:43.248 --> 44:44.747
(chuckling)

44:44.749 --> 44:46.049
- That's spooky.

44:49.954 --> 44:51.421
- If you want to
break up with me,

44:51.423 --> 44:53.790
this us what happens when
you break up with me.

44:59.597 --> 45:02.765
What, you're not
gonna talk to me now?

45:03.835 --> 45:05.101
- Just take me home.

45:11.242 --> 45:13.309
(somber music)

45:13.311 --> 45:15.678
- I still do consider
you my girlfriend.

45:17.882 --> 45:20.783
(engine rumbling)

45:28.460 --> 45:29.859
- If we're doing
something illegal

45:29.861 --> 45:31.461
we should think like criminals.

45:32.597 --> 45:35.164
Like mob guys, how
would they do it?

45:36.034 --> 45:37.300
- I have no idea.

45:40.004 --> 45:41.037
You know who might?

45:42.407 --> 45:45.308
- I don't really
know any mob guys but

45:48.480 --> 45:49.378
if I did,

45:52.183 --> 45:53.750
here's how they'd do it.

45:53.752 --> 45:55.451
- He knows mob guys.

45:55.453 --> 45:57.086
- We'll have two locations,

45:57.088 --> 45:59.756
a place for the
abortions and a front

45:59.758 --> 46:02.258
because women may show
up with family, friends,

46:02.260 --> 46:05.261
so everyone but the woman
can stay at the front

46:05.263 --> 46:08.731
and then a driver can take her
to a place for the procedure.

46:08.733 --> 46:11.067
- Also, this doctor
said that he wants

46:11.069 --> 46:12.902
all the women to be blindfolded

46:12.904 --> 46:14.704
when they get the
procedure done.

46:14.706 --> 46:16.606
- Well, that's rough on them.

46:16.608 --> 46:18.040
- His rule, not ours,

46:18.042 --> 46:20.710
but all the doctors we
spoke to wanted it that way.

46:20.712 --> 46:23.246
- Janice said that we can
start with her apartment

46:23.248 --> 46:24.247
as the front.

46:27.318 --> 46:28.718
- So,

46:28.720 --> 46:30.853
guess we should just be focused
on getting the word out.

46:30.855 --> 46:34.090
(upbeat guitar music)

46:45.904 --> 46:48.638
(phone ringing)

46:54.546 --> 46:55.444
- Hello?

46:56.948 --> 46:58.614
Yeah.

46:58.616 --> 46:59.549
Yeah.

46:59.551 --> 47:01.450
The number for this has changed.

47:01.452 --> 47:02.685
Can you let everyone know

47:02.687 --> 47:04.720
that the number for
this has changed?

47:04.722 --> 47:06.556
Everyone in Chicago?

47:06.558 --> 47:07.456
Okay, hold on.

47:08.459 --> 47:09.826
I'll give you the new one.

47:15.099 --> 47:16.032
- You have to go?

47:17.001 --> 47:18.301
- Yes.

47:18.303 --> 47:19.502
- Right now?

47:19.504 --> 47:21.370
- It's a meeting
for the service.

47:23.107 --> 47:24.674
- You said you were gonna quit.

47:25.610 --> 47:27.176
- I am.

47:27.178 --> 47:30.413
(upbeat guitar music)

47:33.318 --> 47:36.219
We got 15 calls this week.

47:36.221 --> 47:37.153
- That's a lot.

47:37.155 --> 47:39.856
- So I was thinking,

47:39.858 --> 47:41.524
instead of me calling
them all back,

47:41.526 --> 47:42.992
we could divide them up.

47:44.062 --> 47:47.496
Each of us could council
a couple of them,

47:47.498 --> 47:49.365
make sure they wanna
go through with it

47:49.367 --> 47:50.967
and set up the appointment.

47:54.172 --> 47:55.238
- What do we say?

47:56.875 --> 47:59.342
- 30 year old mother of
four, six weeks pregnant.

47:59.344 --> 48:02.578
- I got a 20 year old
college student, three weeks.

48:02.580 --> 48:03.679
- Yours is easier.

48:04.482 --> 48:05.848
- Maybe.

48:05.850 --> 48:07.750
- Well what do I say
to a mother of four?

48:07.752 --> 48:09.218
I mean, I've never
been a mother.

48:09.220 --> 48:10.119
- I don't know.

48:11.890 --> 48:12.788
- Ugh.

48:14.292 --> 48:15.491
I hate phone calls to strangers.

48:15.493 --> 48:16.292
- Donna,

48:16.294 --> 48:17.193
just do it.

48:21.499 --> 48:22.498
Yes, go.

48:22.500 --> 48:23.699
- I'm not good at this.

48:23.701 --> 48:24.600
- [Maggie] Stop.

48:27.272 --> 48:29.071
- Edna, crackers.

48:29.073 --> 48:30.840
Jack, honey, spoon.
(phone ringing)

48:30.842 --> 48:31.908
Not fingers.

48:32.744 --> 48:34.477
It's lunchtime, sweetheart.

48:34.479 --> 48:36.612
(children shouting)

48:36.614 --> 48:38.014
- Hello?

48:38.016 --> 48:39.282
- Hi.

48:39.284 --> 48:40.783
This is Jane calling.

48:42.854 --> 48:43.753
Hello?

48:45.456 --> 48:46.289
- What?

48:46.291 --> 48:47.256
- She hung up.

48:57.235 --> 48:59.068
- Well maybe it
wasn't a good time.

48:59.871 --> 49:01.070
- Should I call back?

49:03.808 --> 49:06.776
(children playing)

49:09.681 --> 49:12.148
- Please call back.

49:12.150 --> 49:15.351
Please call back, please
call back, please call back.

49:15.353 --> 49:19.188
Please call back,
please call back.

49:19.190 --> 49:21.958
(phone ringing)

49:23.061 --> 49:24.894
- Hi, is this Harriet?

49:24.896 --> 49:27.763
This is Jane from
Women's Liberation.

49:29.901 --> 49:30.817
- Oh, thank God.

49:30.818 --> 49:31.734
- Yeah, I know, I was
nervous to call too.

49:31.736 --> 49:33.369
I'm just starting this.

49:33.371 --> 49:35.471
You know, we're here to listen,

49:35.473 --> 49:39.108
so I can give you details
about the procedure

49:39.110 --> 49:41.877
or I can just talk or whatever.

49:43.548 --> 49:44.947
- I just, I can't, I can't.

49:47.151 --> 49:48.617
- Can't what?

49:48.619 --> 49:51.053
(children yelling)

49:51.055 --> 49:52.588
- I can't have another kid.

49:55.360 --> 49:56.258
- Yeah,

49:57.061 --> 49:57.960
I understand.

49:59.564 --> 50:00.997
- [Girl Voice Recording]
So, call me after eight.

50:00.999 --> 50:02.865
I get home from work then.

50:02.867 --> 50:04.934
That's my number.

50:04.936 --> 50:06.068
Thanks so much.

50:06.070 --> 50:06.969
Bye.

50:10.508 --> 50:14.443
- [Woman Voice Recording]
Hello, this is...

50:14.445 --> 50:15.945
Can I not say my name?

50:16.981 --> 50:18.781
Can I just leave my number?

50:20.718 --> 50:21.784
I'm gonna call back.

50:26.024 --> 50:28.858
Hi, it's me again.

50:28.860 --> 50:29.759
I just...

50:30.862 --> 50:32.661
My family is really
well connected

50:32.663 --> 50:35.965
and I was trying to get the
money to go to Europe for this

50:35.967 --> 50:37.633
but now my father got suspicious

50:37.635 --> 50:40.102
and he wants me to
marry the guy who...

50:41.606 --> 50:44.073
You know what, let me
leave you my number,

50:44.075 --> 50:45.408
I'm in Highland Park.

50:46.811 --> 50:47.777
- I don't want this one.

50:47.779 --> 50:50.546
Super snobby, Highland Park.

50:50.548 --> 50:51.414
- I'll take her.

50:53.251 --> 50:56.652
- Okay, 19 year old not
even sure she's pregnant.

50:56.654 --> 50:58.187
- I can take that one.

50:59.223 --> 51:02.224
So we do a procedure
called a D&C

51:02.226 --> 51:05.394
and it's basically where
we open up the uterus

51:05.396 --> 51:06.695
and just scrape it out.

51:12.470 --> 51:16.205
- I went to this doctor who
told me I had to marry the dad.

51:17.175 --> 51:18.774
He basically said I was a slut

51:18.776 --> 51:20.242
and that I needed
to marry the dad.

51:20.244 --> 51:23.379
- Yeah, that's not
always a good idea.

51:23.381 --> 51:25.247
- You wanna guess
where the dad is?

51:25.249 --> 51:26.182
- Vietnam.

51:26.184 --> 51:27.083
- Prison.

51:29.253 --> 51:30.519
- Well,

51:30.521 --> 51:33.489
look, I have a pamphlet
all about the procedure,

51:33.491 --> 51:37.293
so you know exactly
what to expect.

51:38.229 --> 51:39.228
You should read it.

51:40.298 --> 51:43.699
I kinda wish I had that
kind of information

51:43.701 --> 51:44.667
when I was younger.

51:45.636 --> 51:47.136
(baby crying)

51:47.138 --> 51:49.905
- So this is your actual
house and everything?

51:49.907 --> 51:51.340
- Yeah.

51:51.342 --> 51:53.342
We wanna treat women
like human beings.

51:54.445 --> 51:56.579
- And that's your actual
kid and everything?

51:56.581 --> 51:57.646
- Yeah.
(chuckling)

52:00.985 --> 52:01.884
- Far out.

52:08.659 --> 52:10.559
(knocking)

52:10.561 --> 52:11.393
- Hey.

52:11.395 --> 52:12.294
- Hey.

52:13.631 --> 52:15.030
A couple more for tonight.

52:15.032 --> 52:18.033
- I know that you're
officially off duty tonight

52:18.035 --> 52:20.402
but Bill just told me
his parents are in town.

52:20.404 --> 52:23.906
Can you possibly take the girl
I'm supposed to help tonight?

52:23.908 --> 52:25.674
- Yeah, which one was it?

52:25.676 --> 52:26.675
- Highland Park.

52:26.677 --> 52:28.310
Really snobby.

52:28.312 --> 52:29.578
- Really?

52:29.580 --> 52:32.481
(engine rumbling)

52:36.487 --> 52:38.754
Okay, this is where
we ask for the money.

52:38.756 --> 52:40.823
We ask you to give
as much as you can

52:40.825 --> 52:42.158
on the assumption
that other women

52:42.160 --> 52:43.626
may not have as much as you.

52:44.428 --> 52:45.561
- I don't have a lot.

52:50.768 --> 52:54.970
- Excuse me, and I don't
usually do this to people,

52:54.972 --> 52:56.505
but aren't you
from Highland Park?

52:56.507 --> 52:58.908
And you're telling me you
couldn't get together $500.

52:58.910 --> 53:00.910
- I'm not living at
Highland Park right now.

53:00.912 --> 53:03.078
- Okay, well wherever
you're living,

53:03.080 --> 53:05.147
I'm gonna have to send
you home to get some money

53:05.149 --> 53:06.849
because we have enough
trouble helping women

53:06.851 --> 53:08.384
who are legitimately poor.

53:09.287 --> 53:10.686
- I'm not living in
Highland Park right now

53:10.688 --> 53:12.821
because my parents
kicked me out.

53:12.823 --> 53:15.891
I mean, I don't think my dad
believes in rape or something,

53:15.893 --> 53:18.160
so I got together what I could.

53:18.162 --> 53:20.329
It's not a lot but I'll
pay more later when I can,

53:20.331 --> 53:21.230
I promise.

53:22.266 --> 53:23.332
Just please help me.

53:30.675 --> 53:32.441
- Put this on
before we get there.

53:36.414 --> 53:39.315
(engine rumbling)

53:44.689 --> 53:45.854
- I'm scared.

53:49.260 --> 53:50.125
- This way.

54:09.013 --> 54:09.912
- Hey.

54:10.781 --> 54:12.047
How're you doing tonight?

54:13.551 --> 54:14.450
- I'm okay.

54:15.586 --> 54:17.119
- Do you know how
far along you are?

54:17.121 --> 54:17.953
- I'm four weeks.

54:17.955 --> 54:19.588
- Are you sure?

54:19.590 --> 54:20.489
- Yes.

54:22.126 --> 54:23.425
- Hey,

54:23.427 --> 54:25.227
don't worry, you'll
do great, okay?

54:26.297 --> 54:27.796
If I hurt you, these
girls are gonna bust me.

54:27.798 --> 54:29.064
They're gonna take
me to the police.

54:29.066 --> 54:29.898
Isn't that right?

54:29.900 --> 54:31.166
- That's right.

54:31.168 --> 54:32.968
- You're in good hands.

54:32.970 --> 54:35.704
So I'm gonna start with
a local anesthetic.

54:35.706 --> 54:37.606
It won't hurt that much, okay?

54:43.914 --> 54:46.315
All right, you're just gonna
feel a little pinch here.

54:46.317 --> 54:48.751
(gasping)

54:48.753 --> 54:50.686
- Hey, I'm gonna hold your hand.

54:52.290 --> 54:55.124
(dramatic music)

55:06.771 --> 55:10.005
(crickets chirping)

55:10.007 --> 55:12.141
You have the antibiotics?

55:13.611 --> 55:15.577
He gave you the
ergotrate shot, right?

55:17.882 --> 55:19.882
That should make the
bleeding less bad.

55:22.553 --> 55:25.521
Just do whatever he
says and you'll be fine.

55:25.523 --> 55:28.190
- Okay.

55:28.192 --> 55:31.026
- You can take
the blindfold off.

55:37.635 --> 55:38.534
You okay?

55:39.470 --> 55:41.003
- Yeah.

55:41.005 --> 55:41.904
- Hey.

55:43.007 --> 55:44.673
I'm sorry I yelled at you early.

55:45.776 --> 55:48.243
It's just, when you called,

55:48.245 --> 55:49.611
you reminded me of my mom.

55:51.315 --> 55:52.314
She works at Vogue.

55:54.051 --> 55:55.451
- I love Vogue.

55:55.453 --> 55:56.585
- I hate Vogue.

55:56.587 --> 55:58.887
(laughing)

56:00.024 --> 56:01.757
But I shouldn't have
taken it out on you.

56:04.729 --> 56:06.161
- Can I ask you a question?

56:07.064 --> 56:07.963
- Sure.

56:09.967 --> 56:11.467
- Do you need any volunteers?

56:12.703 --> 56:14.303
For your group.

56:14.305 --> 56:16.505
(chuckling)

56:16.507 --> 56:19.908
(pleasant guitar music)

56:31.021 --> 56:33.455
- Everybody, this is Linda.

56:33.457 --> 56:35.424
She's gonna be helping out.

56:35.426 --> 56:36.325
- Hi.

56:36.327 --> 56:38.627
- Maybe joining up.

56:38.629 --> 56:42.931
So I have the cards because
I'm "Callback Jane."

56:42.933 --> 56:45.234
I take down the messages

56:45.236 --> 56:47.403
and then I hand them
over to "Big Jane."

56:49.874 --> 56:51.340
- That's me right now.

56:51.341 --> 56:52.807
- And she makes sure each woman
gets assigned a councilor.

56:54.111 --> 56:56.845
- We've got a woman
who's seven months along.

56:56.847 --> 56:57.946
Anyone?

56:57.948 --> 56:58.914
- I'll take it.

56:58.916 --> 57:00.215
- You do them that late?

57:00.217 --> 57:01.784
- Nothing after the
second trimester.

57:01.786 --> 57:03.752
But we still have
to talk to her.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.287
Make sure she gets counseling

57:05.289 --> 57:07.856
so she doesn't try to take
things into her own hands.

57:07.858 --> 57:10.692
- We've got a 23
year old, two months.

57:13.798 --> 57:15.431
- Do I have to take someone?

57:15.433 --> 57:16.932
- No.

57:16.934 --> 57:18.901
When people first start, we
usually have them at the front

57:18.903 --> 57:21.403
just talking to the
woman and the families.

57:21.405 --> 57:23.005
Do you think you could do that?

57:24.008 --> 57:25.207
- I think so.

57:25.209 --> 57:26.041
- Four months?

57:26.043 --> 57:26.942
- Yeah.
- Okay.

57:29.146 --> 57:30.379
- We used a condom.

57:33.884 --> 57:34.783
And then...

57:40.958 --> 57:42.958
When I told him that I
needed money for this,

57:42.960 --> 57:47.062
he said he can't because
he's buying a boat.

57:47.064 --> 57:47.963
- A boat?

57:49.200 --> 57:50.132
- He sails.

57:52.002 --> 57:54.736
He was saving up for a
sailboat for the summer.

57:55.940 --> 57:58.841
- I hope you said what
I would have said.

58:00.211 --> 58:02.444
- My dad punched me in the
face when he found out.

58:03.948 --> 58:07.149
So I'm gonna tell him that
it made me lose the baby.

58:07.151 --> 58:09.218
It's the only way to
stop him from killing me.

58:10.955 --> 58:13.755
(dramatic music)

58:15.226 --> 58:16.658
- I didn't have much money.

58:19.296 --> 58:22.164
So I tried to do it myself
with a knitting needle.

58:25.736 --> 58:28.170
I've got a tampon in
or I'd be bleeding.

58:28.172 --> 58:29.071
- Oh.

58:30.174 --> 58:31.874
I don't think you
should have a tampon,

58:31.876 --> 58:34.910
maybe if you wanna try a pad.

58:34.912 --> 58:36.011
That would be better.

58:38.449 --> 58:39.414
Oh, honey.

58:39.416 --> 58:40.415
Uh, Janice?

58:40.417 --> 58:41.783
- Oh.

58:41.785 --> 58:43.485
Oh, okay.

58:43.487 --> 58:45.354
We can't treat you like this.

58:45.356 --> 58:47.022
You have to go to
the emergency room.

58:47.024 --> 58:48.257
- But I can't.

58:48.259 --> 58:50.459
- But you could get an
infection or bleed out.

58:50.461 --> 58:51.693
You have to come to
the emergency room

58:51.695 --> 58:53.629
but I'll have a
driver take you, okay?

58:53.631 --> 58:54.696
- They'll arrest me.

58:54.698 --> 58:55.664
- So play dumb.

58:55.666 --> 58:57.199
Say you got in an accident.

58:57.201 --> 58:58.433
They'll stitch you up

58:58.435 --> 59:00.435
and you can come back
here another time, okay?

59:00.437 --> 59:01.336
- I can't.

59:02.439 --> 59:04.973
I'll kill myself first,
do you understand me?

59:04.975 --> 59:05.874
- Okay.

59:06.777 --> 59:08.243
Okay, okay.

59:10.481 --> 59:12.881
She will drive you to our
doctor and we will see

59:12.883 --> 59:14.449
if he can stitch you up, okay?

59:16.086 --> 59:16.885
Okay?

59:16.887 --> 59:17.719
- Hi.

59:17.721 --> 59:18.687
Hi, come with me.

59:18.689 --> 59:19.555
- Go on.

59:33.003 --> 59:35.837
¶ I'm scared ¶

59:35.839 --> 59:40.776
¶ Of turning into
something unfamiliar ¶

(baby crying)

1:00:26.156 --> 1:00:28.890
(door thudding)

1:00:33.030 --> 1:00:35.764
(phone ringing)

1:00:39.803 --> 1:00:40.986
- Hello?

1:00:42.172 --> 1:00:43.438
I know what you're doing.

1:00:45.275 --> 1:00:46.141
- Who is this?

1:00:47.478 --> 1:00:49.745
- [Woman On Phone] You oughta
be ashamed of yourself.

1:00:49.747 --> 1:00:52.014
- What is it that you
think we're doing?

1:00:52.016 --> 1:00:54.149
- [Woman On Phone] Getting
rid of pregnancies.

1:00:55.519 --> 1:00:57.586
- Women are dying and
we're trying to stop that.

1:00:58.455 --> 1:00:59.655
- [Woman On Phone] They
made their decisions

1:00:59.657 --> 1:01:00.722
and they can live with them.

1:01:01.992 --> 1:01:04.493
- Well, what if
they lose their jobs

1:01:04.495 --> 1:01:05.861
or their places to live?

1:01:05.863 --> 1:01:07.929
- [Woman On Phone]
Well I think it's wrong

1:01:07.931 --> 1:01:09.498
and I wanted to let
you know that I'm going

1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:11.099
to report you to the police.

1:01:12.269 --> 1:01:13.835
- Well...
(phone clicking)

1:01:13.837 --> 1:01:14.703
Hello?

1:01:15.906 --> 1:01:16.805
Hello?

1:01:21.045 --> 1:01:21.943
Shit.

1:01:22.980 --> 1:01:25.714
(ominous music)

1:01:45.803 --> 1:01:47.436
Rose, we have to talk.

1:01:49.106 --> 1:01:50.372
I think we're in trouble.

1:01:56.180 --> 1:01:57.646
(knocking)

1:01:57.648 --> 1:01:59.114
- Didn't expect that
I would be the one

1:01:59.116 --> 1:02:01.216
picking out the
wedding invitations.

1:02:01.218 --> 1:02:02.417
- Ah, I'm sorry.

1:02:03.587 --> 1:02:05.253
I've been busy.

1:02:05.255 --> 1:02:06.154
- What is that?

1:02:07.257 --> 1:02:09.291
- I'm hiding it
in here for Janice

1:02:09.293 --> 1:02:13.261
but I may keep it
in here for awhile.

1:02:13.263 --> 1:02:14.696
- What is it, Rose?

1:02:17.434 --> 1:02:20.068
(somber music)

1:02:30.781 --> 1:02:33.615
So, you weren't arrested yet.

1:02:34.852 --> 1:02:37.619
- Anytime in the next week.

1:02:39.790 --> 1:02:41.556
I don't know how
I'll tell my mom.

1:02:42.459 --> 1:02:43.825
She doesn't know anything.

1:02:43.827 --> 1:02:46.928
- Well, can you say you
don't know these women?

1:02:46.930 --> 1:02:49.264
Can you say you had
nothing to do with it?

1:02:49.266 --> 1:02:50.165
- But it's...

1:02:51.301 --> 1:02:53.368
I really feel that it's
the right thing to do.

1:02:53.370 --> 1:02:56.138
- What about the
rest of your life?

1:02:56.140 --> 1:02:57.572
I mean, I'm running for office.

1:02:57.574 --> 1:02:59.074
If this comes out about you.

1:03:00.110 --> 1:03:02.210
I'm running in a
Catholic neighborhood.

1:03:02.212 --> 1:03:03.578
- I know.

1:03:05.516 --> 1:03:06.465
- I...

1:03:06.466 --> 1:03:07.415
I just don't understand
why you're willing

1:03:07.417 --> 1:03:09.151
to throw away your
entire life for this

1:03:09.153 --> 1:03:10.385
when all you have to do it quit.

1:03:10.387 --> 1:03:12.320
- I can't leave all those
other women to take the blame

1:03:12.322 --> 1:03:13.221
when it was my idea.

1:03:13.223 --> 1:03:14.122
- Your idea?

1:03:18.262 --> 1:03:20.328
What do you mean, "your idea?"

1:03:23.834 --> 1:03:24.699
Oh God.

1:03:27.938 --> 1:03:29.371
Jesus Christ, Rose.

1:03:30.474 --> 1:03:32.007
The newspaper's gonna
have a field day.

1:03:32.009 --> 1:03:34.476
- I don't know
what's gonna happen.

1:03:34.478 --> 1:03:35.644
Maybe nothing.

1:03:35.646 --> 1:03:36.545
- Rose.

1:03:38.415 --> 1:03:39.815
I'm sorry but I...

1:03:42.719 --> 1:03:46.621
We can't be married and
have this hanging over us.

1:03:46.623 --> 1:03:48.557
This is our whole
future on the line.

1:03:49.660 --> 1:03:51.226
You say that I'm not
sticking with you.

1:03:51.228 --> 1:03:54.062
Well, you're the one
not sticking with me.

1:03:54.064 --> 1:03:56.431
You have to say
you're not involved.

1:03:57.668 --> 1:03:59.534
- I have to stick
by everyone else.

1:03:59.536 --> 1:04:01.803
(scoffing)

1:04:03.207 --> 1:04:04.239
- I can't do this.

1:04:05.542 --> 1:04:09.110
You chose this
without asking me.

1:04:09.112 --> 1:04:12.013
You could've asked me first,
you're supposed to be my wife.

1:04:19.423 --> 1:04:20.322
- I love you.

1:04:22.659 --> 1:04:23.558
- I know.

1:04:32.836 --> 1:04:34.202
I can't do this, I'm sorry.

1:04:38.775 --> 1:04:39.674
Rose,

1:04:41.245 --> 1:04:42.444
if you do get arrested,

1:04:44.014 --> 1:04:44.946
just say nothing.

1:04:46.049 --> 1:04:48.617
All right, just
wait for a lawyer.

1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:52.454
(dramatic music)

1:05:00.030 --> 1:05:01.830
- Maybe it's time that we
get out of the shadows.

1:05:01.832 --> 1:05:03.198
Announce that we're here.

1:05:04.368 --> 1:05:05.834
- [Janice] Now?

1:05:05.836 --> 1:05:07.202
- What do we have to lose?

1:05:08.538 --> 1:05:09.471
I'm not scared.

1:05:10.507 --> 1:05:12.140
- Are you sure that that's
in the best interest

1:05:12.142 --> 1:05:13.408
of the women who come here?

1:05:13.410 --> 1:05:15.143
- You've been saying
it for months.

1:05:15.145 --> 1:05:16.912
People need to know this exists.

1:05:16.914 --> 1:05:17.846
So we'll tell them.

1:05:17.848 --> 1:05:19.347
- No, no, what've been saying

1:05:19.349 --> 1:05:21.650
is that I think it's in
the longterm best interest

1:05:21.652 --> 1:05:23.418
to change public opinion.

1:05:23.420 --> 1:05:25.620
- They're holding a big
protest this weekend.

1:05:25.622 --> 1:05:28.323
So we'll join in,
hold up a sign.

1:05:28.325 --> 1:05:29.758
An abortion service.

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.726
- Okay, so you hold up a sign

1:05:31.728 --> 1:05:33.528
and if you get arrested
it's a statement

1:05:33.530 --> 1:05:36.298
but for the women who come
here, it's real life, okay?

1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:38.433
They meet us here.

1:05:38.435 --> 1:05:40.468
- I'm not saying
everyone has to do it.

1:05:41.872 --> 1:05:43.672
Is anyone willing
to do it with me?

1:05:44.875 --> 1:05:47.509
(upbeat music)

1:05:49.146 --> 1:05:51.279
- Well, what the hell,
I'll bring my kid.

1:05:54.518 --> 1:05:56.051
- If you want a
pamphlet, let us know.

1:05:56.053 --> 1:05:57.585
- Yeah, don't end up like me.

1:05:58.755 --> 1:05:59.621
- Hi, Jane.

1:06:00.390 --> 1:06:01.289
Hi, Jane.

1:06:02.793 --> 1:06:05.427
(upbeat music)

1:06:09.666 --> 1:06:10.999
- That's funny.

1:06:11.768 --> 1:06:12.667
- What's funny?

1:06:16.340 --> 1:06:17.305
Wow.

1:06:17.307 --> 1:06:18.640
Right there in the paper.

1:06:21.111 --> 1:06:22.177
- I wanna help them.

1:06:29.052 --> 1:06:29.951
- Okay.

1:06:33.256 --> 1:06:34.155
- Okay.

1:06:38.328 --> 1:06:39.627
- They're really good.

1:06:39.629 --> 1:06:41.162
You're gonna be fine.

1:06:41.164 --> 1:06:43.965
- Were up to 30
women a week now.

1:06:43.967 --> 1:06:45.367
A lot of them are poor.

1:06:46.770 --> 1:06:49.137
Abortion was legalized in
New York State last year.

1:06:49.139 --> 1:06:52.107
People who have 300 bucks
take a bus to New York.

1:06:52.109 --> 1:06:54.876
So we're left with the
people who can't afford that.

1:06:56.513 --> 1:06:59.514
(women chattering)

1:07:11.161 --> 1:07:13.461
(knocking)

1:07:19.436 --> 1:07:20.935
Can I help you?

1:07:20.937 --> 1:07:24.839
- Yeah, I found a jumper on
the bridge on Michigan Avenue.

1:07:25.709 --> 1:07:27.242
I thought I'd bring her here.

1:07:29.012 --> 1:07:30.478
Listen,

1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:31.379
you know,

1:07:32.749 --> 1:07:34.983
a lot of the guys, we know
what it is that you do here.

1:07:34.985 --> 1:07:36.484
We don't have a problem with it.

1:07:38.855 --> 1:07:40.238
Most of us.

1:07:40.239 --> 1:07:41.622
But you can't keep
going like this forever.

1:07:41.625 --> 1:07:43.358
My advice would be to lay low.

1:07:45.695 --> 1:07:46.995
- Lay low?

1:07:46.997 --> 1:07:48.730
- If you stick your head
out and give my lieutenant

1:07:48.732 --> 1:07:51.199
any reason to arrest you,
he's looking for that.

1:07:52.069 --> 1:07:53.234
You understand me?

1:07:53.236 --> 1:07:54.102
- Yes.

1:07:56.206 --> 1:07:57.939
- Okay.

1:07:57.941 --> 1:07:58.807
You can...

1:07:58.809 --> 1:07:59.674
It's okay.

1:08:04.781 --> 1:08:05.747
This is Laura.

1:08:08.952 --> 1:08:09.884
She's 14.

1:08:13.090 --> 1:08:14.722
I'm gonna leave her here, okay?

1:08:17.127 --> 1:08:18.026
All right.

1:08:20.063 --> 1:08:20.962
- Hi, Laura.

1:08:25.702 --> 1:08:27.569
- Come on in, Donna,
close the door.

1:08:29.473 --> 1:08:30.371
Take a seat.

1:08:33.677 --> 1:08:37.078
I have something pretty
serious to discuss with you.

1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:38.646
- Okay.

1:08:38.648 --> 1:08:40.849
- We're a Catholic community.

1:08:40.851 --> 1:08:42.350
- I understand that.

1:08:42.352 --> 1:08:44.552
- And I understand that
you have been doing things

1:08:44.554 --> 1:08:47.789
that are not in the spirit
of the Catholic community.

1:08:47.791 --> 1:08:48.723
- Okay,

1:08:48.725 --> 1:08:50.325
can you clarify what I did?

1:08:52.395 --> 1:08:53.461
- A student said...

1:08:54.631 --> 1:08:56.064
There's been some kind of rumor

1:08:56.066 --> 1:08:59.968
that any students who wanna
can come to you and...

1:09:02.405 --> 1:09:03.304
Get that.

1:09:04.341 --> 1:09:05.940
- Oh, that.

1:09:05.942 --> 1:09:09.577
Yeah, well at least it's
accurate information.

1:09:09.579 --> 1:09:12.247
- You don't understand
what I'm telling you here.

1:09:12.249 --> 1:09:13.281
You're fired.

1:09:13.283 --> 1:09:14.482
- Excuse me?

1:09:14.484 --> 1:09:15.850
- You're not keeping
with the trad--

1:09:15.852 --> 1:09:17.619
- No, listen!

1:09:17.621 --> 1:09:19.787
In the last 10 years
before I started here,

1:09:19.789 --> 1:09:21.956
we were losing five
or six girls a year

1:09:21.958 --> 1:09:25.026
to dropping out or
mysteriously going to Europe

1:09:25.028 --> 1:09:26.194
or to a home somewhere

1:09:26.196 --> 1:09:28.630
for lack of this really
basic information

1:09:28.632 --> 1:09:31.299
that they're not allowed
to have until when?

1:09:31.301 --> 1:09:32.800
When they're married?

1:09:32.802 --> 1:09:34.068
Not when it's a life
and death issue,

1:09:34.070 --> 1:09:36.404
the way it is when you're 15?

1:09:36.406 --> 1:09:38.239
You must've noticed that
in the last two years,

1:09:38.241 --> 1:09:40.742
we have only had two
girls get pregnant.

1:09:40.744 --> 1:09:44.679
That means that maybe five
or six girls where saved

1:09:44.681 --> 1:09:47.615
by just knowing these basic
facts about their own body.

1:09:47.617 --> 1:09:50.485
- We got a parental
complaint, Mrs. Lisnewski.

1:09:50.487 --> 1:09:52.854
So if you have some
kind of radical agenda,

1:09:52.856 --> 1:09:55.757
I'm afraid you're going to
have to take it elsewhere.

1:09:55.759 --> 1:09:58.259
We don't want those kind
of ideas in Lake Forest.

1:09:59.362 --> 1:10:00.795
Now if you'll do me
the enormous favor

1:10:00.797 --> 1:10:04.065
of taking that with
you when you leave.

1:10:04.067 --> 1:10:04.966
Thank you.

1:10:08.438 --> 1:10:11.105
(somber music)

1:10:31.628 --> 1:10:34.762
(entry bell ringing)

1:10:35.565 --> 1:10:36.464
- Linda.

1:10:37.434 --> 1:10:39.734
You aren't returning our calls,

1:10:39.736 --> 1:10:41.236
your mother's worried sick.

1:10:41.238 --> 1:10:43.338
- I don't wanna talk to you.

1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:46.174
- I'd like to know what
happened to the baby.

1:10:46.176 --> 1:10:47.041
- I lost it.

1:10:51.181 --> 1:10:53.648
- This is not how we do
things in this family.

1:10:53.650 --> 1:10:54.849
This is not acceptable.

1:10:55.685 --> 1:10:57.452
Turn around when I speak to you.

1:10:59.256 --> 1:11:00.521
- I was raped, Dad.

1:11:01.891 --> 1:11:03.958
- A lot of misunderstands
happen between good people.

1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:04.993
- He's not a good person.

1:11:04.995 --> 1:11:07.161
- He's been coming by the house.

1:11:07.163 --> 1:11:08.696
He's very sorry.

1:11:08.698 --> 1:11:10.231
If you would just sit
down and talk to him.

1:11:10.233 --> 1:11:12.233
- You wanna know something?

1:11:12.235 --> 1:11:14.235
I am happy and if you loved me,

1:11:14.237 --> 1:11:16.504
you would be happy
that I'm happy.

1:11:16.506 --> 1:11:19.407
- I would be happy when
I see you settle down.

1:11:20.243 --> 1:11:21.509
- This isn't the 18th century.

1:11:21.511 --> 1:11:24.212
You don't have to marry
me off to some bachelor.

1:11:24.214 --> 1:11:27.715
I'm happy right here
right now with my life.

1:11:27.717 --> 1:11:29.450
And I may never get married.

1:11:29.452 --> 1:11:30.618
- And then what?

1:11:31.588 --> 1:11:32.787
What will you do with yourself?

1:11:32.789 --> 1:11:34.689
- I'll have a life.

1:11:34.691 --> 1:11:35.823
I'll have a career.

1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:38.326
You and mom have
spent your whole lives

1:11:38.328 --> 1:11:40.361
doing exactly what
was expected of you.

1:11:41.398 --> 1:11:43.064
Now you're mad that I'm free

1:11:43.066 --> 1:11:44.365
and I don't have
to listen to you.

1:11:44.367 --> 1:11:48.569
But I'm in control of
my life and I like it.

1:11:52.008 --> 1:11:53.308
- That's always what people say

1:11:53.310 --> 1:11:54.776
right before they
ruin their lives.

1:11:57.647 --> 1:11:58.513
- Go.

1:12:01.418 --> 1:12:02.317
Please.

1:12:10.427 --> 1:12:13.594
(entry bell ringing)

1:12:14.597 --> 1:12:16.764
- Jacqueline
McKinna, nine weeks.

1:12:18.001 --> 1:12:18.933
- Thursday.

1:12:18.935 --> 1:12:21.769
- By the way, I don't know
if we need more volunteers

1:12:21.771 --> 1:12:23.504
or what but I'm starting
to get complaints

1:12:23.506 --> 1:12:25.873
from some of the Janes that
they're working too hard.

1:12:28.812 --> 1:12:30.211
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:12:30.213 --> 1:12:32.413
How was your first
night at the place?

1:12:32.415 --> 1:12:33.448
- Um...

1:12:33.450 --> 1:12:35.483
I need to talk to you.

1:12:35.485 --> 1:12:38.019
I told you that I used to
work as a nurse, right?

1:12:40.256 --> 1:12:42.290
- You don't need that much
for it to be affective.

1:12:42.292 --> 1:12:45.159
- Take it easy, princess,
I know what I'm doing.

1:12:45.161 --> 1:12:47.528
- When did you graduate
from med school?

1:12:47.530 --> 1:12:48.429
- 1954.

1:12:49.265 --> 1:12:50.298
- How old are you?

1:12:50.300 --> 1:12:52.300
- 35, how old are you?

1:12:52.302 --> 1:12:55.470
- So you graduated
when you were 19?

1:12:55.472 --> 1:12:57.605
- Oh, did I say 54?

1:12:57.607 --> 1:12:58.973
I meant 58.

1:13:00.377 --> 1:13:01.809
- He's not a doctor?

1:13:04.214 --> 1:13:05.079
- I mean,

1:13:06.649 --> 1:13:09.617
maybe if he's doing
the procedure okay,
it doesn't matter.

1:13:09.619 --> 1:13:12.520
- He's not a fucking doctor!

1:13:15.024 --> 1:13:16.357
- I don't know.

1:13:17.127 --> 1:13:18.693
Where's she going?

1:13:21.064 --> 1:13:23.631
(dog barking)

1:13:26.202 --> 1:13:28.302
- Hello, Doctor Charlie.

1:13:28.304 --> 1:13:30.438
- Oh, here we go.

1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:31.839
- You're not a doctor?

1:13:31.841 --> 1:13:33.541
- You knew you were gonna
say something, I knew it.

1:13:33.543 --> 1:13:35.176
- You lied to me!

1:13:35.178 --> 1:13:36.677
You're not a fucking doctor!

1:13:36.679 --> 1:13:39.580
- I'm better than most doctors
because I do this every day!

1:13:39.582 --> 1:13:41.616
- And you are out
of your goddamn mind

1:13:41.618 --> 1:13:44.685
if you think I'm ever
bringing a single woman to you

1:13:44.687 --> 1:13:45.453
ever again!

1:13:45.455 --> 1:13:46.687
- Let me get a
second, all right?

1:13:46.689 --> 1:13:47.622
You girls came to me.

1:13:47.624 --> 1:13:48.523
Remember that, huh?

1:13:48.525 --> 1:13:50.158
Have I hurt anybody?

1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:52.693
Have I let a single patient die?

1:13:52.695 --> 1:13:54.295
I'm nothing like the guys
you're gonna find out there.

1:13:54.297 --> 1:13:55.997
- What? You're in it for money.

1:13:55.999 --> 1:13:57.064
You said so yourself!

1:13:57.066 --> 1:13:59.467
- Isn't that part of your cause?

1:13:59.469 --> 1:14:00.802
Is that what this is about?

1:14:00.804 --> 1:14:02.703
I make money because
I need to eat.

1:14:02.705 --> 1:14:03.905
Let me tell you a
little something.

1:14:03.907 --> 1:14:05.873
I've been threatened
for what I'm doing here.

1:14:05.875 --> 1:14:08.576
Okay, the mob guys don't love
that I'm underselling them

1:14:08.578 --> 1:14:09.844
and I've been threatened
with a bullet,

1:14:09.846 --> 1:14:11.879
so I'd like a little respect!

1:14:11.881 --> 1:14:13.347
- You can't even admit
you did anything wrong.

1:14:13.349 --> 1:14:16.150
- Because I didn't
do anything wrong!

1:14:16.152 --> 1:14:18.119
We're all criminals in this room

1:14:18.121 --> 1:14:20.154
and that included all of you.

1:14:21.291 --> 1:14:22.657
- Let's go, we're leaving.

1:14:23.626 --> 1:14:24.525
- Janice.

1:14:32.235 --> 1:14:33.734
We can find somebody else.

1:14:34.938 --> 1:14:36.671
- For his prices, not likely.

1:14:38.007 --> 1:14:41.309
Anyone we find will probably
also be a fucking liar.

1:14:41.311 --> 1:14:43.978
- Well, he didn't actually
hurt anybody, right?

1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:46.347
- We lied to all of those women!

1:14:47.517 --> 1:14:50.051
We told them that
they're safe here.

1:14:50.053 --> 1:14:54.155
And instead we took them to
some back alley con artist?

1:14:54.157 --> 1:14:56.657
With a fake medical license!

1:15:04.234 --> 1:15:06.501
I was sexually
molested when I was 13.

1:15:10.707 --> 1:15:14.809
This 35 year old man
from my synagogue,

1:15:14.811 --> 1:15:15.943
and I was 13,

1:15:17.614 --> 1:15:18.679
and he...

1:15:23.152 --> 1:15:27.255
And my mom got him kicked out
of the synagogue immediately

1:15:27.257 --> 1:15:29.757
because she's this
tough Jewish woman

1:15:29.759 --> 1:15:31.592
and I always
respected her for that

1:15:32.695 --> 1:15:34.695
but when I needed to
talk to her about it,

1:15:36.232 --> 1:15:37.598
she wouldn't.

1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:40.568
She made me swear
never to tell anybody

1:15:42.338 --> 1:15:44.739
because she knew I would
be treated differently

1:15:46.175 --> 1:15:47.275
and she's right.

1:15:48.711 --> 1:15:50.278
And that is bullshit!

1:15:53.049 --> 1:15:56.350
Why is it that men
do this stuff to us

1:15:56.352 --> 1:15:59.253
and we're the ones that have
to deal with the consequences?

1:16:00.390 --> 1:16:02.690
(knocking)

1:16:10.066 --> 1:16:11.432
- Can I get a minute here?

1:16:12.302 --> 1:16:13.200
- Why?

1:16:15.605 --> 1:16:17.738
- Because I can tell
you the truth, okay?

1:16:26.983 --> 1:16:29.216
I never really had a job.

1:16:29.218 --> 1:16:31.385
I was always doing
something illegal.

1:16:32.455 --> 1:16:34.622
When I was 14 I was
working for a bookie but

1:16:35.725 --> 1:16:38.359
I learned abortions from
these mob guys in LA.

1:16:39.495 --> 1:16:41.495
They had a system
for their hookers.

1:16:41.497 --> 1:16:44.832
Look, I'm sorry I lied, okay?

1:16:44.834 --> 1:16:47.268
But, honestly, I could
make a lot more money

1:16:47.270 --> 1:16:49.604
doing this for anybody else

1:16:49.606 --> 1:16:52.106
and I like being apart of this.

1:16:57.981 --> 1:17:01.616
- So you're telling us
you're able to do all of that

1:17:01.618 --> 1:17:03.384
without a medical license?

1:17:03.386 --> 1:17:06.520
- It's not that hard if
you know what you're doing.

1:17:07.657 --> 1:17:09.657
- So, can you teach it to us?

1:17:10.793 --> 1:17:12.360
- What?

1:17:12.362 --> 1:17:14.161
- [Rose] To all of
us in the group?

1:17:14.998 --> 1:17:16.664
- Are you out of your mind?

1:17:16.666 --> 1:17:19.133
Do you have any idea
the penalties you're
facing for that?

1:17:19.135 --> 1:17:21.469
Jail time you're
facing if you do that.

1:17:21.471 --> 1:17:24.138
- If you teach us, we
can do the simple ones

1:17:24.140 --> 1:17:25.706
and you can do the hard stuff.

1:17:27.043 --> 1:17:29.310
- Why would you wanna
do that to yourselves?

1:17:30.647 --> 1:17:33.214
- There are women who
can't afford 500 dollars.

1:17:33.216 --> 1:17:35.850
We're getting 30
women a week now.

1:17:35.852 --> 1:17:38.719
If you take the tough
cases, we'll take the rest

1:17:38.721 --> 1:17:41.022
and we can do it for
a lot less money.

1:17:41.024 --> 1:17:42.657
- Yeah but you're gonna
need to buy equipment.

1:17:42.659 --> 1:17:45.092
You need medical supplies,
you need anesthetic.

1:17:55.138 --> 1:17:56.504
- I wanna be taught first.

1:18:01.711 --> 1:18:04.745
- All right, so our job
is just to get access

1:18:04.747 --> 1:18:06.480
so we can tear the
amniotic sac, okay?

1:18:06.482 --> 1:18:09.183
We start with a
shot of ergotrate.

1:18:09.185 --> 1:18:12.119
It helps keep them from
hemorrhaging afterwards.

1:18:12.121 --> 1:18:14.622
And it's four shots of
Zylocaine to help numb the pain.

1:18:14.624 --> 1:18:15.523
Okay?

1:18:18.628 --> 1:18:20.027
This is a curette.

1:18:20.029 --> 1:18:22.196
Kinda looks like a spoon, right?

1:18:22.198 --> 1:18:23.064
- Yes.

1:18:26.536 --> 1:18:27.435
- Okay.

1:18:34.177 --> 1:18:35.076
Yeah.

1:18:52.228 --> 1:18:53.127
- So?

1:18:55.064 --> 1:18:56.397
What's it like?

1:18:57.867 --> 1:18:59.166
- I don't know.

1:19:02.772 --> 1:19:04.939
Women's bodies are
always in men's hands.

1:19:06.709 --> 1:19:09.043
I always went to a male doctor.

1:19:09.045 --> 1:19:11.145
But this was us

1:19:12.215 --> 1:19:14.048
doing it for us.

1:19:17.353 --> 1:19:19.887
I don't know what
it was like for her

1:19:19.889 --> 1:19:20.788
but...

1:19:22.692 --> 1:19:24.692
I know how it all
works in there now.

1:19:25.828 --> 1:19:27.094
- You know what's funny?

1:19:29.332 --> 1:19:31.298
Midwives have probably
been doing this

1:19:31.300 --> 1:19:33.100
for thousands of years

1:19:35.471 --> 1:19:37.204
and they just didn't
talk about it.

1:19:37.206 --> 1:19:38.739
- Yeah, well, I wish they had

1:19:38.741 --> 1:19:41.675
because it's a lot harder to
figure it out for ourselves.

1:19:43.513 --> 1:19:44.712
- I wanna learn next.

1:19:46.082 --> 1:19:48.215
If we're gonna get
serious about this,

1:19:48.217 --> 1:19:50.951
we have to find a different
place and a different front.

1:19:50.953 --> 1:19:52.820
We can't use our
apartments anymore.

1:19:54.457 --> 1:19:56.290
- How do we pay for that?

1:19:57.627 --> 1:20:00.394
- We could charge the
women 20, maybe 30 dollars

1:20:00.396 --> 1:20:02.763
just to cover the
apartments and the supplies.

1:20:02.765 --> 1:20:03.998
- Do we pay ourselves?

1:20:06.235 --> 1:20:07.568
- Like as employees?

1:20:07.570 --> 1:20:08.836
- I mean, this is work.

1:20:08.838 --> 1:20:10.337
I got fired from my other job

1:20:10.339 --> 1:20:12.439
and I was already spending
as much time here as there,

1:20:12.441 --> 1:20:14.942
so, if you guys
gave me a salary--

1:20:14.944 --> 1:20:16.210
- No.

1:20:16.212 --> 1:20:17.111
- Why?

1:20:18.181 --> 1:20:19.613
Women's work is
always undervalued.

1:20:19.615 --> 1:20:21.649
We're expected to just
do things for free?

1:20:21.651 --> 1:20:22.950
- This is crazy, no.

1:20:22.952 --> 1:20:25.653
If we pay ourselves,
we're not councilors,

1:20:25.655 --> 1:20:27.087
we're abortionists.

1:20:27.089 --> 1:20:28.722
- That's already
going to be the case.

1:20:28.724 --> 1:20:30.257
- We wouldn't make a profit,
I'm not talking about--

1:20:30.259 --> 1:20:33.127
- Do you know how much
jail time we'd be facing?

1:20:33.129 --> 1:20:34.762
- We're already
facing jail time.

1:20:34.764 --> 1:20:35.863
- I think you're
just saying that

1:20:35.865 --> 1:20:37.865
because you're
unemployed right night.

1:20:37.867 --> 1:20:40.401
- Well, what about
you, you're pregnant.

1:20:40.403 --> 1:20:41.769
- So?

1:20:41.770 --> 1:20:43.136
- Have you ever considered
how that makes the women feel,

1:20:43.139 --> 1:20:45.372
to show up here and
look at a pregnant lady?

1:20:46.776 --> 1:20:50.211
- I think that it shows that
we're inclusive of all women.

1:20:50.213 --> 1:20:51.478
- I actually agree.

1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:53.247
I don't think pregnant
women should be allowed

1:20:53.249 --> 1:20:54.415
to work in this service.

1:20:54.417 --> 1:20:56.250
- Why am I just
hearing about this now?

1:20:56.252 --> 1:20:59.286
- Yeah, we're hearing
about a lot of things now.

1:20:59.288 --> 1:21:01.088
Why didn't we know
Charlie wasn't a doctor?

1:21:01.090 --> 1:21:02.723
How long have you
known about that?

1:21:02.725 --> 1:21:04.024
- Not that long.

1:21:04.026 --> 1:21:05.326
- Not that long?

1:21:05.328 --> 1:21:06.794
How long?

1:21:06.796 --> 1:21:09.964
You guys know all this stuff
and you don't tell us anything.

1:21:09.966 --> 1:21:11.932
We're risking
everything being here.

1:21:11.934 --> 1:21:14.501
I have a kid, I'm a single mom.

1:21:14.503 --> 1:21:18.138
I'm not gonna risk her having
to grow up without a mother

1:21:18.140 --> 1:21:21.041
because you guys wanna
do this for money.

1:21:27.984 --> 1:21:28.883
- Barb.

1:21:30.152 --> 1:21:30.885
(door thudding)

1:21:33.389 --> 1:21:34.288
- I wanna stay.

1:21:35.591 --> 1:21:38.225
(somber music)

1:21:50.539 --> 1:21:51.405
- Thanks.

1:21:55.912 --> 1:21:59.647
- Do you think I'm
making the right choice?

1:21:59.649 --> 1:22:02.683
- I think that's up to
you to decide, not me.

1:22:11.193 --> 1:22:12.092
- I am.

1:22:14.463 --> 1:22:16.030
I just wanted to say that.

1:22:17.166 --> 1:22:18.499
A couple of months
back I called you

1:22:18.501 --> 1:22:20.067
and threatened to turn you in.

1:22:24.674 --> 1:22:25.572
- Oh.

1:22:26.342 --> 1:22:27.474
- I'm so sorry.

1:22:30.613 --> 1:22:31.512
I just...

1:22:34.517 --> 1:22:36.583
My mom said that I would
burn in eternal hell

1:22:36.585 --> 1:22:38.018
if I ever got an abortion.

1:22:41.891 --> 1:22:43.824
I know it's a sin, I just...

1:22:48.898 --> 1:22:50.164
Ow.

1:22:50.166 --> 1:22:51.031
- Sorry.

1:22:51.033 --> 1:22:52.032
It'll be over soon.

1:22:55.771 --> 1:22:58.906
- I still don't even
believe in abortion.

1:23:00.209 --> 1:23:01.375
This is different.

1:23:03.913 --> 1:23:05.446
- They all are.

1:23:05.448 --> 1:23:08.282
(dramatic music)

1:23:15.524 --> 1:23:19.360
(distant train horn blowing)

1:23:27.403 --> 1:23:30.104
- That really wasn't so bad.

1:23:30.106 --> 1:23:31.305
- Good.

1:23:31.307 --> 1:23:34.408
Okay, here are
your instructions.

1:23:34.410 --> 1:23:36.243
Take the antibiotics
all the way to the end

1:23:36.245 --> 1:23:37.444
and you should be fine.

1:23:37.446 --> 1:23:39.079
But you need to
check for infection.

1:23:39.081 --> 1:23:41.382
If you show any symptoms,
go to the emergency room.

1:23:41.384 --> 1:23:42.282
Okay?

1:23:44.286 --> 1:23:46.153
- I thought you were going
to stick a knife in me

1:23:46.155 --> 1:23:48.188
and just slice
around everywhere.

1:23:49.859 --> 1:23:50.758
- No.

1:23:51.927 --> 1:23:53.093
- That's what I heard.

1:23:54.163 --> 1:23:56.063
I really shouldn't tell
my aunt about this.

1:23:56.065 --> 1:23:58.132
She is really religious.

1:23:59.235 --> 1:24:00.834
But I just feel
like I was tricked.

1:24:02.238 --> 1:24:04.671
I mean, he said he wasn't
going to have sex with me

1:24:04.673 --> 1:24:08.042
and then all of a sudden
he was inside of me

1:24:08.044 --> 1:24:10.544
and he said, "I slipped."

1:24:10.546 --> 1:24:11.745
- So you were raped.

1:24:14.083 --> 1:24:15.616
- I wouldn't call it rape.

1:24:15.618 --> 1:24:17.518
He says he feels
really bad about it.

1:24:18.754 --> 1:24:20.287
He wants to see me again.

1:24:22.725 --> 1:24:24.291
I really shouldn't tell
my aunt about this.

1:24:24.293 --> 1:24:26.126
She is really religious.

1:24:26.128 --> 1:24:28.028
- Okay, okay, after
I get off of work,

1:24:28.030 --> 1:24:30.097
you and I are gonna
have a long talk, okay?

1:24:30.099 --> 1:24:31.131
Can you stay around?

1:24:31.133 --> 1:24:32.132
- Mm-hmm.

1:24:32.134 --> 1:24:33.033
- Okay.

1:24:42.745 --> 1:24:45.045
(clicking)

1:24:47.583 --> 1:24:48.482
- Is that?

1:24:50.586 --> 1:24:52.086
Is someone tapping my phone?

1:24:53.355 --> 1:24:56.090
(ominous music)

1:24:57.893 --> 1:25:00.627
Okay, well if this is the FBI,

1:25:00.629 --> 1:25:02.262
I'd just like to say something.

1:25:03.332 --> 1:25:05.999
I mean, I was,

1:25:06.001 --> 1:25:07.468
I know a lot of you guys

1:25:07.470 --> 1:25:10.838
were probably raised going
to church and so was I

1:25:12.208 --> 1:25:15.476
and in church they made
everything sound so easy.

1:25:16.679 --> 1:25:18.178
But it's not black and white.

1:25:19.815 --> 1:25:21.949
And if anyone's listening,

1:25:21.951 --> 1:25:23.050
I just wanna say,

1:25:24.553 --> 1:25:27.421
if the sermons had been
more like real life,

1:25:27.423 --> 1:25:30.190
I might be able to
take them seriously.

1:25:30.192 --> 1:25:33.327
But as it is, we're
all just doing

1:25:33.329 --> 1:25:34.995
the best we can here, okay?

1:25:40.669 --> 1:25:42.669
- What were you thinking?

1:25:42.671 --> 1:25:44.004
- I know.

1:25:44.006 --> 1:25:44.905
Don't...

1:25:45.975 --> 1:25:48.075
Don't tell the
other women, okay?

1:25:49.044 --> 1:25:52.579
I just, it made me so angry.

1:25:52.581 --> 1:25:56.283
Because they could've
been listening for weeks.

1:25:56.285 --> 1:25:57.751
And they're listening to people

1:25:57.753 --> 1:26:01.121
tell the most intimate details
of their lives, you know?

1:26:01.123 --> 1:26:02.656
It just made me so angry.

1:26:05.394 --> 1:26:06.860
- Oh my God.

1:26:06.862 --> 1:26:07.761
- What?

1:26:09.198 --> 1:26:10.497
- You're turning into me.

1:26:12.601 --> 1:26:13.667
(chuckling)

1:26:17.339 --> 1:26:19.239
You have your medications.

1:26:19.241 --> 1:26:20.541
Is there anything else you need?

1:26:20.543 --> 1:26:22.743
- I need to go home
to my daughter.

1:26:22.745 --> 1:26:24.912
She was at the hospital
today for surgery.

1:26:26.215 --> 1:26:28.282
- So what you could do
since you're first starting

1:26:28.284 --> 1:26:29.750
is just work at the front.

1:26:29.752 --> 1:26:33.320
Talk to people, make sure they
have everything they need.

1:26:33.322 --> 1:26:35.355
Help watch the kids of any moms.

1:26:36.525 --> 1:26:38.292
- You said there's pay, right?

1:26:38.294 --> 1:26:39.226
- Not much.

1:26:39.228 --> 1:26:41.028
You know but something.

1:26:41.030 --> 1:26:42.329
- I can drive you there.

1:26:42.331 --> 1:26:43.964
(door thudding)

1:26:43.966 --> 1:26:46.166
(police radio commotion)

1:26:46.168 --> 1:26:47.100
- This is the police.

1:26:47.102 --> 1:26:48.535
Everyone stay where you are.

1:26:48.537 --> 1:26:49.469
Do not attempt--

1:26:49.471 --> 1:26:50.704
- Everyone listen
to me, say nothing.

1:26:50.706 --> 1:26:51.972
- You're all under arrest.

1:26:51.974 --> 1:26:53.607
- Say absolutely nothing
until you see a lawyer.

1:26:53.609 --> 1:26:55.209
- Oh, Jesus, my daughter
is at the hospital.

1:26:55.211 --> 1:26:56.476
- Say nothing.

1:26:56.478 --> 1:26:57.644
- Just start with her.

1:26:58.981 --> 1:26:59.913
- [Man] She did this!

1:26:59.915 --> 1:27:01.215
I told her it was illegal!

1:27:01.217 --> 1:27:02.482
This isn't my fault!

1:27:03.552 --> 1:27:04.718
- [Officer] Where is he?

1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:06.386
Where the hell is he?

1:27:06.388 --> 1:27:07.988
- I don't know what you mean.

1:27:07.990 --> 1:27:09.223
- [Officer] Yeah, sure.

1:27:13.495 --> 1:27:15.162
- He was looking for the doctor.

1:27:16.265 --> 1:27:18.565
That's why he was
asking about a man.

1:27:21.237 --> 1:27:23.971
(ominous music)

1:27:35.718 --> 1:27:38.051
(exhaling)

1:27:46.095 --> 1:27:48.729
(somber music)

1:27:55.037 --> 1:27:56.737
- Sorry about all
this, you know.

1:27:57.706 --> 1:28:00.407
I mean, to be honest,

1:28:00.409 --> 1:28:04.144
you helped a lot of girlfriends
and wives of the guys here.

1:28:04.146 --> 1:28:06.880
But somebody called
in a complaint.

1:28:06.882 --> 1:28:07.848
- Who called in a complaint?

1:28:07.850 --> 1:28:09.549
- Was it the FBI?

1:28:10.853 --> 1:28:11.818
- Somebody's aunt.

1:28:13.022 --> 1:28:13.920
- Brenda.

1:28:14.790 --> 1:28:16.423
Brenda's aunt.

1:28:17.493 --> 1:28:19.393
- That sounds right?

1:28:19.395 --> 1:28:22.329
- "I better not tell my aunt,
she's really religious?"

1:28:23.399 --> 1:28:25.532
I talked to that
girl for 45 minutes.

1:28:26.568 --> 1:28:28.101
- I guess she changed her mind.

1:28:32.675 --> 1:28:35.676
- I'm gonna smack her!

1:28:35.678 --> 1:28:36.743
I'm gonna go to there house

1:28:36.745 --> 1:28:38.178
and I'm going to beat her down!

1:28:38.180 --> 1:28:39.413
- Janice.

1:28:39.415 --> 1:28:41.081
- I'm not kidding, Rose,
I'm gonna kill her.

1:28:41.083 --> 1:28:43.150
She cried on me, I held her.

1:28:44.086 --> 1:28:45.585
- [Officer] Turn right.

1:28:45.587 --> 1:28:48.055
- Guys, look, they're treating
the patients worse than us.

1:28:48.057 --> 1:28:48.955
- Come on!

1:28:50.426 --> 1:28:52.426
Ladies, you know how to walk!

1:28:53.929 --> 1:28:55.662
- Those are pregnant women.

1:28:55.664 --> 1:28:58.465
- Yeah, and we're college
educated white girls.

1:29:06.809 --> 1:29:08.175
- Used to be a teacher.

1:29:08.177 --> 1:29:09.209
So did I.

1:29:09.211 --> 1:29:10.777
- What subject?

1:29:10.779 --> 1:29:12.379
- Biology.

1:29:12.381 --> 1:29:13.246
- I was history.

1:29:14.183 --> 1:29:15.515
- Where did you go wrong?

1:29:16.885 --> 1:29:17.951
- Where did you?

1:29:20.289 --> 1:29:22.689
- [Man] You're
looking at 110 years.

1:29:25.260 --> 1:29:26.259
- What?

1:29:26.261 --> 1:29:28.128
- 110 years.

1:29:28.130 --> 1:29:29.696
Would you like to make
a signed statement?

1:29:29.698 --> 1:29:31.131
- No, what, no, asshole.

1:29:31.133 --> 1:29:32.366
I'd like to call my mother!

1:29:32.368 --> 1:29:34.468
- Excuse me, what did
you just say to me?!

1:29:35.304 --> 1:29:36.203
- Nothing.

1:29:39.375 --> 1:29:40.907
- That can't be right.

1:29:40.909 --> 1:29:43.543
I thought five years
was the maximum.

1:29:43.545 --> 1:29:46.046
- No, it's five years
times the number of counts.

1:29:49.017 --> 1:29:49.916
- Oh my God.

1:29:52.121 --> 1:29:54.354
(sighing)

1:29:57.393 --> 1:29:58.825
- [Officer] Hey!
(banging)

1:29:58.827 --> 1:30:01.194
Abortion ladies,
your lawyer's here!

1:30:10.939 --> 1:30:12.272
- Did you call your mom?

1:30:12.274 --> 1:30:13.173
- Not yet.

1:30:14.476 --> 1:30:16.476
- Well, this lawyer's
a friend of my mom's,

1:30:16.478 --> 1:30:18.912
so she's probably gonna
be annoying as hell.

1:30:25.120 --> 1:30:26.052
- I love you.

1:30:26.054 --> 1:30:28.688
I love you all.

1:30:28.690 --> 1:30:30.390
Everybody talks too much.

1:30:30.392 --> 1:30:33.226
You guys didn't say a
goddamn word to the police.

1:30:33.228 --> 1:30:35.195
Not one goddamn word.

1:30:35.197 --> 1:30:37.230
You are my favorite
clients ever.

1:30:39.301 --> 1:30:40.734
Now,

1:30:40.736 --> 1:30:42.836
let's talk posting bail, okay?

1:30:42.838 --> 1:30:44.371
Who here has the rich parents?

1:30:49.845 --> 1:30:52.446
(somber music)

1:31:06.261 --> 1:31:07.194
- Mom.

1:31:07.196 --> 1:31:08.161
- I thought you were dead.

1:31:09.131 --> 1:31:11.898
I had to call your ex-boyfriend.

1:31:11.900 --> 1:31:13.667
- I'm sorry.

1:31:13.669 --> 1:31:15.335
- He had to let me in.

1:31:15.337 --> 1:31:17.304
Said he hasn't
seen you in months.

1:31:18.674 --> 1:31:20.774
You're some kind of abortionist?

1:31:28.717 --> 1:31:32.285
Nobody is gonna hire you to be
a teacher now, you know that?

1:31:33.655 --> 1:31:36.423
I don't know how anybody's
gonna hire you for anything.

1:31:38.227 --> 1:31:41.194
I wanted you to be
an independent woman

1:31:41.196 --> 1:31:43.663
and now you will have
to depend on a husband

1:31:43.665 --> 1:31:45.966
because you won't be
able to earn a living.

1:31:47.736 --> 1:31:49.135
And I don't know who
would marry you now,

1:31:49.137 --> 1:31:50.670
to be quite honest.

1:31:50.672 --> 1:31:51.505
- Mom, stop it.

1:31:51.507 --> 1:31:52.806
- No, I won't stop.

1:31:52.808 --> 1:31:55.509
You don't know how
tough the world can be.

1:31:57.513 --> 1:31:59.112
But you're about to find out.

1:32:00.782 --> 1:32:04.217
And I'm sorry for that but
you did it to yourself.

1:32:05.120 --> 1:32:06.052
- I'm sorry--

1:32:06.054 --> 1:32:07.420
- Why, Rose?

1:32:08.790 --> 1:32:11.925
Huh, for some women who
weren't responsible enough

1:32:11.927 --> 1:32:13.760
to take care of themselves?

1:32:16.899 --> 1:32:19.733
These radicals have
brainwashed you.

1:32:19.735 --> 1:32:21.935
Was it that girl,
Janice, from New York?

1:32:21.937 --> 1:32:23.103
- It was my idea.

1:32:27.309 --> 1:32:30.076
You raised me to be
strong and practical.

1:32:31.113 --> 1:32:33.179
And strong Midwestern
women do not ask

1:32:33.181 --> 1:32:35.081
other people to
solve their problems.

1:32:36.585 --> 1:32:38.852
- Well, I hope you
are strong, Rose,

1:32:38.854 --> 1:32:40.353
because you're gonna need it.

1:32:42.257 --> 1:32:43.356
You're gonna need it.

1:32:45.294 --> 1:32:46.593
I can't be there for you.

1:32:48.297 --> 1:32:49.195
Not for this.

1:33:08.850 --> 1:33:09.816
- Hey.

1:33:09.818 --> 1:33:10.717
- Hi.

1:33:12.554 --> 1:33:14.788
(sighing)

1:33:23.632 --> 1:33:25.365
- We didn't say
a word about you.

1:33:26.234 --> 1:33:28.435
- Well, I appreciate that.

1:33:30.872 --> 1:33:33.340
Still gonna skip town for
a little while though.

1:33:35.043 --> 1:33:37.344
Glad I got to say goodbye though

1:33:37.346 --> 1:33:39.479
and you can tell them
about me if you want.

1:33:39.481 --> 1:33:40.847
They're not gonna find me.

1:33:42.517 --> 1:33:43.483
- We're not gonna say anything.

1:33:47.155 --> 1:33:48.855
I don't even know
your last name.

1:33:49.958 --> 1:33:50.857
- It's Jane.

1:33:52.794 --> 1:33:54.060
(chuckling)

1:33:54.062 --> 1:33:56.396
(laughing)

1:33:57.432 --> 1:33:58.598
- Oh, man.

1:34:01.503 --> 1:34:03.069
Back alley con artist.

1:34:04.239 --> 1:34:05.105
- The best.

1:34:05.107 --> 1:34:07.407
(laughing)

1:34:08.877 --> 1:34:11.111
- Apparently we are
"The Abortion Seven."

1:34:12.481 --> 1:34:13.913
- That's pretty cool.

1:34:13.915 --> 1:34:15.415
- It's not cool, we
shouldn't even be in here.

1:34:15.417 --> 1:34:18.018
- Yeah, does your lawyer know
that were meeting like this?

1:34:18.020 --> 1:34:19.486
- No.

1:34:19.488 --> 1:34:22.589
But we were supposed to
handle 20 women that night.

1:34:22.591 --> 1:34:24.591
Half of them are still pregnant.

1:34:24.593 --> 1:34:25.925
I thought maybe we
could make some calls.

1:34:25.927 --> 1:34:27.560
- I don't feel good about this.

1:34:27.562 --> 1:34:30.030
We're facing a 110 years.

1:34:30.032 --> 1:34:31.765
- No one's forcing
anyone to do anything.

1:34:31.767 --> 1:34:33.700
- But it's not just
those 10 women.

1:34:33.702 --> 1:34:35.135
Mary said she could
have the trial

1:34:35.137 --> 1:34:37.537
postponed by a few
months, maybe longer,

1:34:37.539 --> 1:34:38.672
because there's talk of a case

1:34:38.674 --> 1:34:40.240
making it to the Supreme Court

1:34:40.242 --> 1:34:42.609
but in the meantime,
the phone's ringing.

1:34:44.046 --> 1:34:45.478
- Oh no, no way.

1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:47.681
- All we're asking is if
anyone is willing to continue

1:34:47.683 --> 1:34:49.849
to provide the same
services we did before.

1:34:49.851 --> 1:34:52.052
- This is crazy, the
police know about us.

1:34:52.054 --> 1:34:53.953
- The police knew
about us before.

1:34:53.955 --> 1:34:55.755
We helped their wives and
girlfriends, remember?

1:34:55.757 --> 1:34:57.957
- Yeah, this will directly
affect sentencing thought.

1:34:57.959 --> 1:34:59.492
We're supposed to show that

1:34:59.494 --> 1:35:00.660
we've changed our minds

1:35:00.662 --> 1:35:02.295
and that we feel guilty
about our actions.

1:35:02.297 --> 1:35:03.997
- But we haven't.

1:35:03.999 --> 1:35:05.398
Abortion shouldn't be illegal,

1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:06.666
this is a political statement.

1:35:06.668 --> 1:35:08.935
If we stop our work now,
we imply that it should.

1:35:08.937 --> 1:35:11.571
- I'm sorry but I have kids

1:35:11.573 --> 1:35:14.908
and I cannot spend an
extra few years in jail

1:35:14.910 --> 1:35:17.043
because you want to make
a political statement.

1:35:17.045 --> 1:35:18.278
- I understand.

1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:19.879
If no one wants to
continue doing this,

1:35:19.881 --> 1:35:21.347
I won't judge anyone.

1:35:21.349 --> 1:35:22.282
We just need to know.

1:35:22.284 --> 1:35:23.717
- You always judge everyone.

1:35:23.719 --> 1:35:25.051
- Well I won't this time.

1:35:25.821 --> 1:35:26.720
I swear.

1:35:31.293 --> 1:35:32.192
Rose?

1:35:32.961 --> 1:35:34.227
- I'm in.

1:35:34.229 --> 1:35:35.295
- I'll keep helping.

1:35:37.365 --> 1:35:39.032
- I'm sorry, I feel
like this whole time

1:35:39.034 --> 1:35:41.201
we've been pretending that
we can just ignore the system

1:35:41.203 --> 1:35:43.169
and we'll never get
caught or punished

1:35:43.171 --> 1:35:44.938
but when you fight the system,

1:35:44.940 --> 1:35:47.107
they catch you and
fire you and arrest you

1:35:47.109 --> 1:35:48.508
and I can't play this game

1:35:48.510 --> 1:35:50.076
and pretend it's
gonna happen anymore.

1:35:50.078 --> 1:35:50.977
It happened.

1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:52.779
We're caught.

1:35:54.382 --> 1:35:55.415
I can't, I'm sorry.

1:36:00.188 --> 1:36:01.621
Maggie.

1:36:01.623 --> 1:36:02.555
- I wanna stay.

1:36:04.459 --> 1:36:05.925
- Okay, fine, suit yourself.

1:36:09.631 --> 1:36:12.298
(somber music)

1:36:15.604 --> 1:36:17.971
- I have a family that
I have to take care of.

1:36:19.141 --> 1:36:20.039
- I understand.

1:36:30.585 --> 1:36:33.653
- Maybe I'm stupid but

1:36:33.655 --> 1:36:36.022
I never thought that we
were gonna get caught.

1:36:38.493 --> 1:36:43.129
And when we were, I was just
waiting to regret everything.

1:36:45.033 --> 1:36:45.932
But I don't.

1:36:50.806 --> 1:36:54.707
Hi, I'm calling from the
Chicago Women's Liberation.

1:36:54.709 --> 1:36:56.109
Hi,

1:36:56.111 --> 1:37:00.046
I'm calling from the
Chicago Women's Liberation.

1:37:01.583 --> 1:37:02.582
Yes,

1:37:02.584 --> 1:37:04.784
the Abortion Seven, yes.

1:37:06.388 --> 1:37:07.954
We were wondering,

1:37:07.956 --> 1:37:10.390
we still have some
women who need help

1:37:10.392 --> 1:37:13.426
and we wanted to know if
anyone would be willing

1:37:13.428 --> 1:37:17.931
to donate a van and money
to get them to New York.

1:37:17.933 --> 1:37:21.334
(pleasant guitar music)

1:37:22.804 --> 1:37:23.703
You would?

1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:26.639
Just...

1:37:26.641 --> 1:37:28.675
Why don't I give you our number

1:37:28.677 --> 1:37:30.977
and when you call back,
you can ask for Jane.

1:37:32.614 --> 1:37:34.848
- I saw these women on the news.

1:37:36.751 --> 1:37:37.650
They...

1:37:40.889 --> 1:37:43.823
They help women in
situations like this.

1:37:45.327 --> 1:37:46.860
Yeah,

1:37:46.862 --> 1:37:47.994
the ones on the news.

1:37:48.797 --> 1:37:49.996
They're still doing it.

1:37:51.466 --> 1:37:54.100
I mean, they're white girls
but they do a good job.

1:37:55.370 --> 1:37:57.337
They won't take all
your money either.

1:37:59.608 --> 1:38:01.774
(sighing)

1:38:04.813 --> 1:38:07.280
(whispering)

1:38:11.786 --> 1:38:14.621
- [Woman] I'm feeling
a bit nervous myself.

1:38:14.623 --> 1:38:17.857
(faint singing music)

1:38:23.198 --> 1:38:26.466
- Why didn't you ever
tell me you guys broke up?

1:38:26.468 --> 1:38:31.037
- Oh, I don't know, with all
the stress going on here.

1:38:32.807 --> 1:38:35.875
You know, she's the only
person I've ever dated,

1:38:35.877 --> 1:38:39.112
so I have to learn how
to date now, I guess.

1:38:39.114 --> 1:38:40.513
- I'm sorry.

1:38:40.515 --> 1:38:42.215
- Mm-hmm, thanks.

1:38:47.622 --> 1:38:48.521
- Excuse me.

1:38:51.192 --> 1:38:52.225
- Hi.

1:38:52.227 --> 1:38:53.626
- Hi, I don't mean to be rude

1:38:53.628 --> 1:38:57.030
but maybe you guys
should think about hiring

1:38:57.032 --> 1:38:58.564
more black women here.

1:38:58.566 --> 1:39:02.969
Because a lot of the women
that come here are black.

1:39:02.971 --> 1:39:07.106
- Yeah, I know, we've
thought about that.

1:39:07.108 --> 1:39:08.675
- You've thought about it.

1:39:08.677 --> 1:39:11.411
- We mostly recruit
women who come in here.

1:39:11.413 --> 1:39:13.813
- And we think we felt
bad about recruiting

1:39:13.815 --> 1:39:15.248
people who are really broke,

1:39:15.250 --> 1:39:17.050
which is most of the
women coming in right now.

1:39:17.052 --> 1:39:18.318
- Mm-hmm.

1:39:18.320 --> 1:39:20.620
And we thought that
if we got arrested,

1:39:20.622 --> 1:39:25.391
the police might be
harder on black women, so.

1:39:25.393 --> 1:39:28.494
- All right, I'm just saying.

1:39:28.496 --> 1:39:29.295
- Thank you.

1:39:29.297 --> 1:39:30.196
- Thank you.

1:39:35.270 --> 1:39:36.169
- Hey.

1:39:40.809 --> 1:39:42.442
- How'd it go?

1:39:42.444 --> 1:39:44.010
- I'm okay.

1:39:44.012 --> 1:39:47.080
It hurt a little
but not too bad.

1:39:47.082 --> 1:39:47.947
- All right.

1:39:47.949 --> 1:39:49.615
Let's get you home.

1:39:49.617 --> 1:39:50.950
- Okay.

1:39:50.952 --> 1:39:52.652
- Actually, one second.

1:39:55.256 --> 1:39:57.890
I just wanted to say that
if you need volunteers,

1:39:57.892 --> 1:39:58.858
you can call me.

1:39:59.828 --> 1:40:01.027
- Great.
- Thank you.

1:40:01.029 --> 1:40:02.095
- Thank you.

1:40:02.097 --> 1:40:03.329
- [Roberta] Let me
give you my number.

1:40:03.331 --> 1:40:04.230
- Yeah.

1:40:07.135 --> 1:40:10.937
(television news report music)

1:40:10.939 --> 1:40:13.506
- The Roe V. Wade case,
which was decided today,

1:40:13.508 --> 1:40:15.441
uses the argument
that privacy rights

1:40:15.443 --> 1:40:17.543
protect a woman's
right to an abortion.

1:40:17.545 --> 1:40:20.313
(laughing)
(clapping)

1:40:20.315 --> 1:40:21.147
- Yes!

1:40:21.149 --> 1:40:22.615
- I can't believe it.

1:40:22.617 --> 1:40:25.618
So many women can
finally get help.

1:40:25.620 --> 1:40:27.820
- And this is good
for us, right?

1:40:29.090 --> 1:40:31.290
(laughing)

1:40:31.292 --> 1:40:33.793
- It might not
be, we don't know.

1:40:33.795 --> 1:40:34.727
Not for our case.

1:40:34.729 --> 1:40:36.629
We'll see what Mary says.

1:40:36.631 --> 1:40:38.264
(upbeat guitar music)

1:40:38.266 --> 1:40:39.565
- [Crowd] Abortion
is a woman's right!

1:40:39.567 --> 1:40:41.134
Abortion is a woman's right!

1:40:41.136 --> 1:40:42.835
Abortion is a woman's right!

1:40:42.837 --> 1:40:44.470
Abortion is a woman's right!

1:40:44.472 --> 1:40:46.773
(cheering)

1:40:48.476 --> 1:40:49.909
Abortion is a woman's right!

1:40:49.911 --> 1:40:50.877
Abortion is a woman's right!

1:40:50.879 --> 1:40:52.912
- They're protesting for us.

1:40:52.914 --> 1:40:54.514
- I'm proud of
you, you know that?

1:40:54.516 --> 1:40:56.649
- [Protestors] Abortion
is a woman's right!

1:40:56.651 --> 1:40:58.317
Abortion is a woman's right!

1:40:58.319 --> 1:40:59.986
Abortion is a woman's right!

1:40:59.988 --> 1:41:01.621
Abortion is a woman's right!

1:41:01.623 --> 1:41:04.023
Abortion is a woman's right!

1:41:10.965 --> 1:41:12.331
- A hundred and ten years.

1:41:18.406 --> 1:41:20.006
I think that would
be enough time

1:41:20.008 --> 1:41:22.775
to do some very good
organizing in prison.

1:41:24.746 --> 1:41:27.747
But really, we could
do a literacy program.

1:41:29.150 --> 1:41:31.717
- Yeah, we could do
a crafts collective.

1:41:31.719 --> 1:41:32.652
- Job training.

1:41:33.888 --> 1:41:35.721
- Or we get raped and murdered.

1:41:37.959 --> 1:41:40.993
- What do you suppose abortion
services are like in prison?

1:41:42.063 --> 1:41:44.897
(chuckling)

1:41:44.899 --> 1:41:47.500
(laughing)

1:41:47.502 --> 1:41:48.367
- Aaaah!

1:41:50.939 --> 1:41:52.438
- Crafts collective.

1:41:52.440 --> 1:41:54.707
(giggling)

1:41:56.177 --> 1:41:57.410
- [Mary] Come on inside.

1:42:15.230 --> 1:42:17.196
- This behavior does not
reflect what I consider

1:42:17.198 --> 1:42:19.932
to be the decent values
of the city of Chicago.

1:42:19.934 --> 1:42:21.634
All of you young ladies
have been behaving in a way

1:42:21.636 --> 1:42:25.071
that I think any decent
person would disapprove of.

1:42:26.141 --> 1:42:27.507
Now, where are
the pregnant women

1:42:27.509 --> 1:42:29.108
who were brought in that night?

1:42:33.748 --> 1:42:36.015
Have they had their babies?

1:42:36.017 --> 1:42:38.985
- None of them have
had babies, your honor.

1:42:38.987 --> 1:42:40.586
- And how did that come to be?

1:42:40.588 --> 1:42:43.422
- [Male Lawyer] We're not
really sure, your honor.

1:42:43.424 --> 1:42:44.524
- Are any of these women willing

1:42:44.526 --> 1:42:45.925
to testify against this group?

1:42:45.927 --> 1:42:47.727
- Not at this time, your honor.

1:42:47.729 --> 1:42:48.961
- [Judge] Not one?

1:42:48.963 --> 1:42:50.263
- [Male Lawyer]
Not at this time.

1:42:50.265 --> 1:42:51.998
- Well, is there any proof
of which of these women

1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:53.733
actually committed
the abortions?

1:42:53.735 --> 1:42:55.368
- Not definite proof, no.

1:42:55.370 --> 1:42:56.669
We have the equipment.

1:42:57.539 --> 1:43:00.106
(somber music)

1:43:04.646 --> 1:43:05.545
- Well,

1:43:07.916 --> 1:43:10.283
given that the Supreme
Court case of Roe V. Wade

1:43:10.285 --> 1:43:14.287
has determined that this
procedure is no longer a crime,

1:43:14.289 --> 1:43:17.356
and given that the evidence
against you is exceedingly thin,

1:43:18.726 --> 1:43:20.393
I'm sorry to say I have
to dismiss the case

1:43:20.395 --> 1:43:21.928
and all charges against you.

1:43:21.930 --> 1:43:22.895
You are free to go.

1:43:22.897 --> 1:43:24.830
(thudding)

1:43:24.832 --> 1:43:26.065
- Yes!

1:43:26.067 --> 1:43:29.035
(laughing)

1:43:29.037 --> 1:43:32.438
(pleasant guitar music)

1:43:47.889 --> 1:43:50.723
(dramatic music)

1:44:05.039 --> 1:44:08.441
