00:58.425 --> 00:59.758
Are you watching closely?

01:06.816 --> 01:11.153
Every magic trick
consists of three parts or acts.

01:11.988 --> 01:14.698
The first part is called the Pledge.

01:14.866 --> 01:18.118
The magician shows you
something ordinary...

01:18.286 --> 01:21.622
...a deck of cards, a bird, or a man.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.672
He shows you this object...

01:30.840 --> 01:32.841
...perhaps he asks you to inspect it...

01:34.010 --> 01:36.637
...to see that it is, indeed, real.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.932
Yeah, unaltered, normal.

01:43.186 --> 01:46.146
But of course, it probably isn't.

01:46.606 --> 01:50.400
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.833
The second act is called the Turn.

02:20.306 --> 02:23.267
The magician takes
the ordinary something...

02:25.228 --> 02:28.063
...and makes it
do something extraordinary.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.446
Now, you're looking for the secret,
but you won't find it...

02:36.614 --> 02:39.908
...because, of course,
you're not really looking.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.202
You don't really wanna know.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.791
You want to be fooled.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.420
But you wouldn't clap yet...

02:52.213 --> 02:56.216
...because making something disappear
isn't enough.

02:56.801 --> 03:00.137
You have to bring it back.

03:01.431 --> 03:05.142
That's why every magic trick
has a third act.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.894
The hardest part.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.898
The part we call the Prestige.

03:21.659 --> 03:25.787
The Prestige. And did Robert Angier,
the Great Danton, your employer...

03:25.955 --> 03:28.624
...get to that final part
of his trick that night?

03:28.791 --> 03:31.585
- No, sir. Something went wrong.
- What went wrong?

03:31.753 --> 03:35.255
I saw someone
making their way below stage.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.132
I followed him.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.552
It was Borden,
watching Mr. Angier drown.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.972
Would you please describe
your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter?

03:44.140 --> 03:45.224
I'm an ingénieur.

03:45.391 --> 03:49.770
I design illusions and construct the
apparatus necessary for performing them.

03:49.938 --> 03:50.938
So, Mr. Cutter...

03:51.105 --> 03:54.274
...was this water-filled tank
beneath the stage...

03:54.442 --> 03:56.193
...part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

03:56.361 --> 03:57.486
No, no. It was...

03:57.654 --> 04:01.823
The tank was brought on for the first trick
and then taken off-stage.

04:01.991 --> 04:05.160
Borden must have placed it
under the trap door after the interval.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.745
How large was this tank?

04:06.913 --> 04:11.500
Oh, it's a normal tank for escape
underwater, about 4 or 500 gallons.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.043
How do you think Mr. Borden...

04:13.211 --> 04:16.672
...was able to move the tank under
the trap door without anyone noticing?

04:16.839 --> 04:18.632
He's a magician. Ask him.

04:18.800 --> 04:23.345
I ask again that this man explain
the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.013
The Real Transported Man...

04:25.181 --> 04:28.183
...is one of the most sought-after illusions
in this business.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.851
I have the right to sell it on.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.604
If I reveal the method here,
then the trick is worthless.

04:32.772 --> 04:36.817
How can we know that the tank wasn't
some part of the trick that went wrong?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.653
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament...

04:39.821 --> 04:42.072
...but Alfred Borden's life
hangs in the balance.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.367
If you were prepared to disclose
the details to me in private...

04:45.535 --> 04:48.120
...I might be able to judge
their relevance to the case.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.872
Might this be an acceptable compromise?

05:09.350 --> 05:12.477
I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn out your pockets.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.066
Not my idea, sir.

05:18.234 --> 05:22.237
The warden saw his show in Manchester
last year where he vanished into thin air.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.365
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

05:28.369 --> 05:31.038
I told him the only way
that Borden's gonna disappear...

05:31.205 --> 05:34.374
...is if I leave him out there
with the other inmates.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.714
Check the locks.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.551
Twice.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.602
My name is Owens.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.937
I'm a solicitor.

05:56.105 --> 05:59.775
I represent Lord Caldlow, an accomplished
amateur magician and historian...

05:59.942 --> 06:01.651
How much?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.821
- Lord Caldlow is interested...
- How much for my tricks?

06:04.989 --> 06:06.281
Five thousand pounds.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.950
Talk with Fallon, my ingénieur.
Money's for him.

06:09.118 --> 06:12.788
Yes, I did.
He offered to sell me your tricks.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.665
All except the most valuable one:
The Transported Man.

06:15.833 --> 06:19.002
Well, I wouldn't forgive myself
for selling my greatest trick.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.462
Even for your daughter?

06:22.298 --> 06:24.841
If the newspapers are right
and you are for the drop...

06:25.009 --> 06:28.387
...your daughter will need looking after.
- Fallon will take care of her.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.973
Bernard Fallon? A man with a past
almost as obscure as your own.

06:32.141 --> 06:34.768
Courts motioned that the girl
be removed from his care.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.354
No, the girl will be an orphan.

06:37.980 --> 06:42.401
I know you're no stranger to the workhouse.
It's better than here?

06:42.568 --> 06:45.612
I'm offering you a way
to wrap up your affairs with dignity.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.656
And I'm offering your daughter a future.

06:47.824 --> 06:51.451
As Lord Caldlow's ward,
she will want for nothing. Ever.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.539
Well, think it over.

06:56.332 --> 07:00.669
And Lord Caldlow would like you
to have this as a show of good faith.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.214
He said it might be of interest.
This is Robert Angier's diary.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.175
Including the time he spent
in Colorado learning your trick.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.844
- He never learned my trick.
- Really?

07:09.011 --> 07:12.514
On his return from Colorado, he mounted
a version of The Transported Man...

07:12.682 --> 07:16.518
...that the papers said
was better even than your original.

07:16.686 --> 07:23.066
If you want Angier's secrets,
you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.194
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.698
Consider your daughter.

07:37.331 --> 07:41.251
A cipher. An enigma.

07:43.129 --> 07:47.799
A search. A search for answers.

07:53.723 --> 07:57.517
EVen if Colorado
is the end of my journey...

07:57.685 --> 08:03.398
...it'll take much longer to unravel
the rest of Borden's secrets.

08:04.984 --> 08:09.571
See, the cipher in his notebook
is unlocked by a single word...

08:09.739 --> 08:15.535
...but it will still take months to translate
his writing and to know his mind.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.708
Well, my passion is equal to the task.

08:33.763 --> 08:37.557
Mr. Angier?
Welcome to Colorado Springs.

08:52.615 --> 08:56.159
- The whole town has electricity.
- Yes, sir.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.887
Well, quite a reception.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.431
You're our first guest of the season,
Mr. Angier.

09:18.599 --> 09:21.977
Your telegram didn't indicate
how long you'll be staying with us.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.645
For as long as it takes.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.982
I'll need a coach tomorrow
to take me up the mountain.

09:27.149 --> 09:30.694
Well, the peak is closed, sir,
for scientific experimentation.

09:30.861 --> 09:34.114
Yes, I know. That's why I'm here.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.712
You'll have to walk the rest,
I'm afraid, sir.

10:23.831 --> 10:29.586
I'm amazed how many of you
newspaper writers can't read my sign.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.509
Not the welcome I was expecting.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.514
I know you.

10:45.394 --> 10:50.065
You're the Great Danton.
I saw your show in London seven times.

10:50.232 --> 10:54.527
You guessed every object
the audience had in their pockets.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.071
I'm Alley.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.698
Sorry about the fence.
People interfere with our work.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.409
- I've come to see Tesla.
- Why?

11:01.577 --> 11:05.413
He made a machine
for a colleague of mine sometime ago.

11:05.581 --> 11:09.084
- Can you get me a meeting with him?
- Impossible, I'm afraid.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.419
I brought a lot of money.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.129
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

11:14.423 --> 11:17.175
I simply can't help you.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.638
I'll be staying at the hotel. Indefinitely.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.725
Hey, what am I holding?

11:26.602 --> 11:27.894
Your watch.

11:32.942 --> 11:38.405
Borden's journal entry for April 3rd, 1897,
describes a show at the Orpheum Theater.

11:38.572 --> 11:42.409
That was just days after he first met me.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.455
We were two young men
at the start of a great career.

11:47.623 --> 11:50.125
Two young men devoted to an illusion.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.460
Two young men
who never intended to hurt anyone.

11:52.628 --> 11:57.132
Which of you brave souls is willing
to bind this lovely young woman?

12:09.437 --> 12:10.812
If you would tie her wrists.

12:11.605 --> 12:16.443
Bind her feet around the ankle.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.611
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

12:18.779 --> 12:20.488
- No.
- No.

12:21.365 --> 12:24.784
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

13:27.848 --> 13:31.142
He's complacent,
he's predictable, he's boring.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.895
I mean, Milton has gotten success,
whatever that means...

13:34.063 --> 13:36.856
...and now he's scared.
He won't take any risks at all.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.734
I mean, he's squandering
the goodwill of the audience...

13:39.902 --> 13:42.862
...with tired, second-rate tricks.
- They're old favorites.

13:43.030 --> 13:46.407
Favorites? Give me something fresh.
He won't even try a bullet catch.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.159
A bullet catch is suicide.

13:48.327 --> 13:52.247
All it takes is some smart-ass volunteer
to put a button in the barrel.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.749
- Fine. Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.752
- There'd be no seats left for the punters.
- No bullet catch.

13:57.920 --> 14:02.257
Whatever. The point is that a real magician
tries to invent something new...

14:02.424 --> 14:05.218
...that other magicians
are gonna scratch their heads over.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.554
And then you sell it to him
for a small fortune.

14:07.721 --> 14:08.721
- All right.
- Yeah.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.723
I suppose you have such a trick.

14:10.891 --> 14:13.309
- Actually, I do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

14:13.477 --> 14:15.019
No.
No one else could do my trick.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.230
- Any trick can be duplicated, right?
- Wrong.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.275
If Mr. Borden
has invented his masterpiece...

14:20.442 --> 14:22.610
...it might be only he's prepared to do it.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.154
Milton is a great showman,
but Borden is right.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.906
He won't get his hands dirty.

14:27.324 --> 14:31.452
If you wanna see what it takes
to make real magic, go to the Tenley.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.330
There's a Chinaman there,
and he really has what it takes.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.749
- Chung Ling Soo.
- Pricey. I can't afford that.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.459
I know the bloke on the door.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.962
You two go and see that show...

14:41.130 --> 14:43.006
...and whichever one of you
can tell me...

14:43.173 --> 14:45.049
...how he does
the goldfish-bowl trick...

14:45.217 --> 14:46.509
...gets a prize.
- All right.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.344
- Which is?
- Ten minutes on-stage...

14:48.512 --> 14:50.305
...with my old friend Mr. Ackerman.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.806
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

14:51.974 --> 14:54.100
The top theatrical agent in London.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.186
I saw you drop the knot again.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.690
- I think I turned my wrist.
- Some nights, you just don't get it, do you?

15:00.858 --> 15:04.819
I mean, if that knot slips
and Julia's on the hoist, she'll break a leg.

15:04.987 --> 15:09.324
It's the wrong knot. Like I said,
the Langford double will hold tighter.

15:09.491 --> 15:13.119
The Langford double isn't a wet knot.
It's too dangerous.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.371
If the rope swells up, she won't slip it.

15:15.539 --> 15:18.666
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- She can slip it. We'll practice.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.168
Hey, Borden, he said no.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.670
Yeah, well, you know knots
better than me, do you?

15:22.838 --> 15:24.756
Listen, no more mistakes.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.508
All right. Yeah, do you?
You wanna take over?

15:27.676 --> 15:30.511
- Just leave it.
- I didn't think so.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.560
- Hey, Cutter, where's he from?
- Where are you from?

15:37.728 --> 15:42.023
- He shifts props for Virgil at the hall.
- Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks?

15:42.191 --> 15:44.484
- He doesn't deal in methods.
- How do you know?

15:44.652 --> 15:49.739
Because I hired him to find out
how Virgil does the orange trick.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.241
- Well, I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

15:52.409 --> 15:53.868
Of course you can't trust him.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.745
I think he's all right.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.247
- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.

15:58.415 --> 16:02.126
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you
kissing your wife's leg every night...

16:02.294 --> 16:04.837
...so can the blokes
at the ends of row three and four.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.414
- You're wrong. It can't be.
- No, it is.

16:39.581 --> 16:43.042
- Look at the man.
- This is the trick.

16:43.210 --> 16:47.755
This is a performance right here.
This is why no one can detect his method.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.092
Total devotion to his art.

16:52.177 --> 16:56.264
Utter self-sacrifice, you know?

16:56.432 --> 17:02.061
It's the only way to escape all this,
you know.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.231
All right.

17:05.398 --> 17:09.318
I can barely lift this thing
and it's not even filled with water.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.989
Or fish. Look.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.282
I don't know. Hang on a second.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.413
He must be strong as an ox.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.501
He's been pretending
to be a cripple for years.

17:25.669 --> 17:29.130
Any time he's in public. Any time
he goes out. It's unthinkable.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.258
Borden saw it at once,
but I couldn't fathom it.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.011
Living my whole life
pretending to be someone else.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.848
- You're pretending to be someone else.
- I don't think changing a name compares.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.476
Not just your name.
Who you are and where you're from.

17:41.643 --> 17:45.897
I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass
them with my theatrical endeavors.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.317
I thought of a name for you.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.695
The Great Danton.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.323
Do you like it?

17:56.450 --> 17:58.659
- But it's sophisticated.
- It's French.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.836
Borden writes as if no one but he
understood the true nature of magic.

18:14.635 --> 18:17.512
But what does he know of self-sacrifice?

18:22.351 --> 18:24.519
You bloody fool.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.507
- He killed it.
- What?

18:54.675 --> 18:55.675
What's wrong?

18:55.843 --> 18:59.887
- He killed it.
- I'm sure he didn't.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.309
See? Look, now
he'll bring it back.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.398
No, he killed it.

19:11.733 --> 19:12.733
No.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.742
Look. See?
He's all right. He's fine.

19:21.910 --> 19:25.913
- Look at him.
- But where's his brother?

19:28.834 --> 19:31.836
He's a sharp lad, your son.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.589
Oh, he's my nephew.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.888
You're the lucky one today.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.785
Are you watching closely?

20:08.540 --> 20:09.957
Look closer.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.795
Never show anyone.

20:15.255 --> 20:19.592
They'll beg you and they'll flatter you for
the secret, but as soon as you give it up...

20:19.760 --> 20:21.219
...you'll be nothing to them.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.596
You understand? Nothing.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.641
The secret impresses no one.

20:26.808 --> 20:30.311
The trick you use it for is everything.

20:34.816 --> 20:39.111
- Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.
- You're welcome.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.824
- Alfred. It's Alfred.
- Alfred.

20:43.992 --> 20:46.827
So I could use a cup of tea.

20:46.995 --> 20:51.332
I'd scandalize the landlord. I think not.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.961
You think that's...?
Is that enough to keep me out?

20:57.172 --> 20:58.339
I think so.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.133
So I'll see you again?

21:10.352 --> 21:11.769
Milk and sugar?

21:33.917 --> 21:37.837
- What's in there?
- Angier's machine.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.972
You built this, Mr. Cutter?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.933
Oh, no, sir.
This wasn't built by a magician.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.060
This was built by a wizard.

21:53.228 --> 21:57.857
A man who can actually do
what magicians pretend to do.

21:58.025 --> 22:02.403
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens
with these things after the trial?

22:02.571 --> 22:04.280
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

22:04.448 --> 22:07.241
An avid collector,
apparently very interested in the case.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.869
Yeah, well, don't let him take this.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.787
- Why ever not?
- It's too dangerous.

22:12.748 --> 22:17.376
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles
it's got a simple and disappointing trick.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.421
Most disappointing of all, sir...

22:21.923 --> 22:23.966
...it has no trick.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.720
It's real.

22:30.932 --> 22:33.100
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

22:33.518 --> 22:35.269
Yes.

22:35.437 --> 22:41.776
This is the place where the performer's
hand reaches through to the trick padlock.

22:41.943 --> 22:44.278
A standard magical apparatus
for escapes.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.822
Yeah, with one important difference:

22:46.990 --> 22:48.908
This isn't a trick lock.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.993
It's been switched for a real one.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.079
What a way to kill someone.

22:53.622 --> 22:57.083
They're magicians, Your Honor.
Showmen.

22:57.250 --> 23:01.295
Men who live by dressing up plain
and sometimes-brutal truths...

23:01.797 --> 23:04.340
...to amaze, to shock.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.884
Even without an audience?

23:07.969 --> 23:09.804
There was an audience.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.807
You see, this water tank...

23:12.974 --> 23:17.144
...was of particular significance
to these two men.

23:17.604 --> 23:21.524
Particularly awful significance.

23:22.984 --> 23:27.988
Which of you brave souls is willing
to bind this lovely young woman?

23:29.908 --> 23:31.867
If you would tie her wrists.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.203
Bind her feet around the ankle.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.510
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

23:49.678 --> 23:50.678
No.

23:51.721 --> 23:55.057
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

24:49.571 --> 24:50.571
Robert!

25:10.884 --> 25:13.469
No! No! No!

25:16.389 --> 25:18.098
Julia. Julia.

25:18.266 --> 25:20.726
Julia! Julia!

26:05.480 --> 26:08.190
I knew an old sailor once.

26:08.358 --> 26:13.362
He told me he went overboard,
tangled in the sails.

26:13.530 --> 26:19.159
They pulled him out,
but it took him five minutes to cough.

26:19.327 --> 26:23.289
He said it was like going home.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.879
What do you want, Borden?

26:37.762 --> 26:39.722
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.894
Which knot did you tie?

26:48.773 --> 26:50.316
I keep asking myself that.

26:51.818 --> 26:54.528
- And?
- And...

26:55.697 --> 26:58.365
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

27:00.535 --> 27:01.994
You don't know?

27:03.455 --> 27:05.497
I'm sorry.

27:06.750 --> 27:15.049
You don't know?

27:21.431 --> 27:22.681
Alfred?

27:22.849 --> 27:25.059
Good news.
We got our first booking today.

27:25.226 --> 27:28.270
- I don't think we've had the pleasure.
- Mr. Fallon is my ingénieur.

27:28.438 --> 27:31.899
- Where did you get all of...?
- Begged, borrowed, and don't ask.

27:32.067 --> 27:36.153
He's a very enterprising soul,
is Mr. Fallon.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.863
- So...
- We can't afford to pay him.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.782
Money will come
when we get the audience.

27:39.949 --> 27:43.410
But what about until then? I mean,
what I earn, it's barely enough for us.

27:43.578 --> 27:46.747
Don't worry about it. I'll share
half my food with him or something.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.542
You're already going to be doing that
with someone else.

27:50.877 --> 27:54.797
- No. You're...?
- Having a baby.

27:55.465 --> 27:58.759
Oh, my God. We should have told Fallon.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.719
That is great. We're having a baby.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.930
- We're having a baby.
- Oh, come here.

28:06.601 --> 28:07.893
Alfred, what's this?

28:08.061 --> 28:12.106
Oh, this is just the trick to wake
Ackerman up at the end of my act.

28:12.273 --> 28:14.900
Is it the masterpiece? The great trick?

28:15.068 --> 28:17.611
No, no, no. The world is not ready
for that one yet.

28:17.779 --> 28:22.116
This is just your run-of-the-mill,
daring, spectacular bullet catch.

28:22.742 --> 28:27.079
- A bullet catch?
- Yeah, but it's safe, I promise. Look.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.750
- Shoot me.
- Shoot you?

28:31.918 --> 28:32.960
Go on, shoot me.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.589
- Right there.
- No, I can't.

28:37.757 --> 28:40.634
No, no, not there. Shoot me here. Don't...

28:45.140 --> 28:48.976
- How's that?
- That's very good.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.812
- Go on, tell me how you do it.
- No, I can't do that.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.900
- Well, then you can't do it. Alfred...
- I can't do it?

28:57.068 --> 29:00.279
I'm sorry, Alfred,
but I can't raise a child on my own.

29:00.905 --> 29:04.158
- You don't tell anybody that I told you.
- Okay.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.034
Gunpowder...

29:07.704 --> 29:08.704
...wadding...

29:10.498 --> 29:12.207
...and a bullet.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.626
A ramrod.

29:19.549 --> 29:20.549
Hold out your hand.

29:23.678 --> 29:27.514
The bullet is not even in the gun
when the charge is fired.

29:27.849 --> 29:31.351
Once you know,
it's actually very obvious.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.396
Well, I mean, you still get...

29:34.564 --> 29:37.524
It's dangerous. I mean,
people still get killed doing that.

29:37.692 --> 29:38.901
- Well, how?
- Well, you know.

29:39.068 --> 29:42.029
Somebody could get a smart-ass.
He can put a penny or a button...

29:42.197 --> 29:45.157
...or may God forbid, Sarah,
somebody could put a bullet there.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.743
Don't worry. Don't worry...

29:47.911 --> 29:51.205
...because I'm not gonna let
anything happen.

29:51.372 --> 29:52.956
Everything's gonna be all right...

29:53.124 --> 29:59.296
...because I love you very much.

30:01.508 --> 30:04.718
- Say it again.
- I love you.

30:05.845 --> 30:08.222
- Not today.
- What?

30:08.389 --> 30:11.517
Well, on some days it's not true,
and today you don't mean it.

30:11.684 --> 30:14.770
Maybe today you're more
in love with magic than me.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.272
I like being able to tell the difference.

30:17.440 --> 30:22.361
It makes the days it is true
mean something.

30:24.572 --> 30:26.114
All right.

30:45.134 --> 30:48.095
Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.056
If there are any
ladies or gentlemen here.

30:51.224 --> 30:54.393
- Solid metal.
- Seen that already.

30:54.561 --> 30:57.437
- Leave it out!
- Come on.

31:01.442 --> 31:04.319
Get out your gun, mate.

31:05.071 --> 31:07.072
- Who threw that?
- I did!

31:12.620 --> 31:15.664
Get out your gun.
You're gonna need it.

31:18.918 --> 31:21.128
Get a gun.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.007
It's what you came for, is it?

31:28.303 --> 31:32.472
So who wants to volunteer?

31:32.974 --> 31:35.475
Me! Me!

31:45.403 --> 31:46.820
Me.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.364
Watch it, cowboy.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.128
Are you man enough, sir?

32:08.217 --> 32:09.801
Yes.

32:20.855 --> 32:31.239
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

32:32.533 --> 32:34.159
I don't know.

32:49.759 --> 32:53.387
He came in to demand an answer,
and I told him the truth.

32:53.554 --> 32:56.556
That I have fought with myself
over that night.

32:56.724 --> 33:00.185
One half of me swearing blind
that I tied a simple slipknot...

33:00.353 --> 33:03.563
...the other half conVinced
that I tied the Langford double.

33:03.731 --> 33:05.941
I can never know for sure.

33:08.528 --> 33:13.240
How can he not know?

33:14.283 --> 33:18.203
He must know what he did. He must.

33:20.915 --> 33:22.874
Sarah, that bloody hurts.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.211
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.714
It's as bad as the day it happened.

33:30.550 --> 33:35.762
- We have to get a doctor back.
- We can't afford the bloody doctor back.

33:35.930 --> 33:38.682
- You've woken her.
- Great.

33:39.642 --> 33:42.269
I'm sorry. I need this to heal
so I can go back to work.

33:42.437 --> 33:46.148
Alfred, face things. What tricks
can you perform with this kind of injury?

33:46.315 --> 33:49.818
I can do card pulls.
I can do some prop tricks.

33:49.986 --> 33:54.281
I can still do that. And I can do the trick
that I've been telling you about.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.450
The one that they're gonna
remember me for.

33:58.953 --> 34:00.746
Come on.

34:26.563 --> 34:29.274
Never thought I'd find an answer
at the bottom of a glass.

34:29.442 --> 34:30.984
Hasn't stopped you looking.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.449
Heard about a booking.

34:37.617 --> 34:41.244
Nice little theater.
Young up-and-coming magician.

34:41.411 --> 34:42.829
- Who?
- You.

34:42.996 --> 34:44.664
You got me a booking? Why?

34:44.831 --> 34:46.750
I wanna keep on working.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.960
And who's gonna hire the ingénieur
that killed Julia McCullough...

34:50.129 --> 34:52.339
...in front of a sellout crowd
at the Orpheum?

34:53.174 --> 34:55.342
Someone who knows
it wasn't your fault.

34:55.510 --> 34:58.887
Someone who knows Alfred Borden
and his repertoire of exotic knots.

34:59.055 --> 35:02.516
I hear he had a spot of bad luck
catching a bullet south of the river.

35:02.683 --> 35:05.102
That's a dangerous trick, that one.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.567
We'll have to whitewash the windows...

35:12.735 --> 35:17.155
...confound the more curious members
of the public, but it will do.

35:18.783 --> 35:21.701
- We should see about an assistant.
- I've made some arrangements.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.288
Have you settled on a name?

35:25.456 --> 35:28.875
Yes, I have. The Great Danton.

35:29.043 --> 35:31.545
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

35:33.047 --> 35:35.215
No, it's sophisticated.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.801
The birdcage can't be our climax.
Everybody knows it.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.512
- Not like this they don't.
- I don't wanna kill doves.

35:40.680 --> 35:44.224
Then stay off the stage.
You're a magician, not a wizard.

35:44.392 --> 35:48.228
You gotta get your hands dirty
if you're gonna achieve the impossible.

35:49.689 --> 35:52.023
In here, Miss Wenscombe.

35:52.191 --> 35:55.569
No point in you meeting Mr. Angier
if you don't fit.

35:55.736 --> 35:57.696
On the right.

35:59.740 --> 36:00.949
What's so hard about this?

36:01.117 --> 36:04.369
Nothing. But you're going down here.

36:06.622 --> 36:10.083
Hold it. Hold it there.
This has gotta go around there.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.335
- And this will conceal it?
- Yeah, oh, sure.

36:12.503 --> 36:13.587
- All right?
- Yeah.

36:13.754 --> 36:16.381
- Now, take that one there.
- Yep. Okay.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.009
- Pin this under.
- And this ties up here?

36:19.177 --> 36:20.969
- That ties at the front.
- That's good.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.936
Breathe as little as possible.

36:35.651 --> 36:38.445
Now, you see? That'll go. That'll flatten.

36:38.613 --> 36:39.905
- I see. Yeah.
- Okay.

36:43.367 --> 36:47.287
She's not experienced,
but she knows how to present herself.

36:47.455 --> 36:51.708
A pretty assistant is the most
effective form of misdirection.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.251
Thank you.

36:53.419 --> 36:55.420
Ladies and gentlemen,
for my final trick...

36:55.588 --> 36:58.256
...I will require the assistance
of two volunteers.

36:58.424 --> 37:00.759
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?

37:02.553 --> 37:05.722
Yeah. Okay. Bring your hand around.

37:06.098 --> 37:07.474
- Under?
- Under, yeah.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.435
There. I put it around its foot.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.437
- Careful.
- He's all right, ain't he?

37:32.833 --> 37:35.669
- You get a volunteer to put a hand there.
- Yeah.

37:35.836 --> 37:36.878
And another one there.

37:37.046 --> 37:40.715
Mr. Merrit, if you'll place your hands
on either side of the cage, please.

37:40.883 --> 37:41.883
Thank you, Olivia.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.843
You best not be intending...

37:44.011 --> 37:46.513
...to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.
- Of course not.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.890
You ready? All right.

37:49.058 --> 37:50.642
One...

37:50.810 --> 37:52.310
Two...

37:52.520 --> 37:54.688
- Three.
- Three. Go.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.526
Well, that's bloody marvelous,
Cutter.

38:00.736 --> 38:01.736
Very nice.

38:01.904 --> 38:04.030
And the best part is...

38:09.328 --> 38:11.454
I thought you said
I had to get my hands dirty.

38:11.622 --> 38:15.041
Someday perhaps you will.
I just had to know that you can.

38:15.209 --> 38:17.919
- Very nice. Very nice, indeed.
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

38:18.087 --> 38:20.922
I haven't had the chance
to compliment your beautiful theater.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.425
Well, it'll be a lot more beautiful
when it's full.

38:23.592 --> 38:25.427
- Don't worry.
- Oh, you all say that.

38:25.594 --> 38:29.389
Why should I worry? If your tricks
don't get them in, somebody else's will.

38:29.557 --> 38:33.727
Maybe somebody willing to do
a bullet catch or a water escape?

38:33.894 --> 38:35.270
Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.

38:35.438 --> 38:39.065
People hoping for an accident,
likely to see one too.

38:39.233 --> 38:41.776
What would that do for your business?

38:42.737 --> 38:45.196
- You got a week, John.
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.584
Thank you.

38:59.712 --> 39:02.255
Sir? In the third row there.

39:02.423 --> 39:05.258
Please stand up
and show us your handkerchief.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.887
This isn't mine.

39:09.055 --> 39:12.140
Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it
to the lady in the aisle.

39:12.308 --> 39:13.600
I believe she has yours.

39:17.229 --> 39:18.813
Thank you.

39:20.983 --> 39:23.401
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm making so many mistakes.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.403
I'm so nervous.

39:26.072 --> 39:28.114
The audience doesn't seem
to be responding.

39:28.282 --> 39:33.078
They've seen a lot of tricks before,
but not this next one.

39:41.837 --> 39:44.047
Put a cloth over.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.008
- Fingers crossed.
- I'll have the champagne ready.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.318
- You've seen this one before?
- We've seen them all.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.904
I'll make it a little harder then, shall I?

40:08.072 --> 40:13.493
Two volunteers, please. A lady
and a gentleman to hold this cage with me.

40:14.161 --> 40:17.872
I'll perform this feat in a manner
never before seen by yourselves...

40:18.040 --> 40:20.875
...or any other audience
anywhere in the world.

40:23.504 --> 40:27.590
Madam, if you'll place one hand on the back
of the cage, one hand on the front.

40:27.758 --> 40:31.636
Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage,
one hand on the top.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.819
- Should have spotted him.
- You had a lot of plates going.

40:47.987 --> 40:50.238
- Don't suppose they'll let us do this again.
- No.

40:50.406 --> 40:54.200
- So, what's the climax of our show?
- Show? You don't have a show.

40:54.368 --> 40:55.994
We have a week's engagement.

40:56.162 --> 40:59.789
To perform magic, not butcher birds
and break my customers' fingers.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.375
Clear out. Anything here
in the morning gets burned.

41:02.543 --> 41:04.878
- Mr. Merrit...
- It's done, John.

41:05.045 --> 41:08.715
I've hired a comedian.
You know I hate comedians.

41:10.217 --> 41:12.385
Well, there's plenty of good theaters.

41:12.553 --> 41:16.556
If we can come up with a new trick,
change the name of the act...

41:16.724 --> 41:18.600
The name stays.

41:20.561 --> 41:25.565
Right. Well, then the new trick's
gonna have to be irresistible, then.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.525
I have a couple of methods to try out.

41:27.693 --> 41:30.987
And then we need a new angle
on the presentation.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.947
Oh, and if you need some inspiration...

41:33.115 --> 41:36.117
...there's a technical exposition
at the Albert Hall this week.

41:36.285 --> 41:38.953
Engineers, scientists, you know?

41:39.121 --> 41:42.290
That sort of thing
captures a public's imagination.

41:59.433 --> 42:02.769
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me
down here during the storms.

42:02.937 --> 42:06.064
Perfect excuse to come join
the Great Danton for a drink.

42:07.274 --> 42:09.067
Two of them.

42:09.610 --> 42:12.111
Beautiful, isn't it, huh?
God, I miss New York though.

42:12.279 --> 42:14.656
- So why are you here?
- The lightning lives here.

42:14.823 --> 42:17.951
And not much else. Our work is secret.

42:18.702 --> 42:20.453
Is that a cipher?

42:22.665 --> 42:25.625
It's a rotating transposition
that shifts every day of the diary.

42:25.793 --> 42:29.671
Simple, but time-consuming to translate,
even when you have the five-letter keyword.

42:29.838 --> 42:31.589
Which is?

42:31.757 --> 42:33.633
We magicians have a circle of trust.

42:33.801 --> 42:37.762
You have a circle of trust
with someone whose diary you stole?

42:37.930 --> 42:38.972
Maybe I bought it.

42:39.807 --> 42:42.475
And you're hoping to find
a great secret in there.

42:42.643 --> 42:46.312
I've already found it.
That's why I'm here.

42:52.653 --> 42:55.613
Tesla built one for another magician.

42:55.781 --> 42:59.033
- Why would you want the same thing?
- Call it a professional rivalry.

42:59.577 --> 43:03.913
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines
for unusual people.

43:04.081 --> 43:05.623
But he would never talk about it.

43:05.791 --> 43:08.710
I understand discretion.
I just want the machine.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.923
Finish your drink.

43:14.925 --> 43:16.259
I wanna show you something.

43:16.427 --> 43:19.679
I think you'll have a special appreciation
for our work.

43:19.847 --> 43:23.224
- I thought it was a secret.
- You're a magician.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.059
Who's gonna believe you?

43:26.353 --> 43:28.396
Not long now.

43:28.564 --> 43:30.982
Our equipment requires
a great deal of current.

43:31.150 --> 43:34.986
Tesla electrified the town in exchange
for using the generators when we need to.

43:37.197 --> 43:40.241
We do our tests
when the townspeople are asleep.

43:40.409 --> 43:43.036
Mr. Tesla doesn't wanna scare anyone.

44:01.013 --> 44:02.889
Where are the wires?

44:04.391 --> 44:05.558
Exactly.

44:14.860 --> 44:18.946
- Where's the generator?
- You saw it last week.

44:19.114 --> 44:22.075
- That must be 10 miles from here.
- Fifteen.

44:22.242 --> 44:25.536
And I have to ride all of them
before I get to bed.

44:26.413 --> 44:29.082
I'll send word for you
in a few days, Mr. Angier.

44:29.458 --> 44:33.252
Magic. Real magic.

44:33.420 --> 44:37.382
Now appearing only here
at London's Royal Albert Hall.

44:37.549 --> 44:39.759
One of the miracles of our age.

44:39.927 --> 44:42.053
A technological marvel.

44:42.221 --> 44:44.430
You've never seen anything like it
in your lives.

44:44.598 --> 44:46.974
Your eyes will not believe
what they're witnessing.

44:47.142 --> 44:50.228
The miracle of Nikola Tesla,
ladies and gentlemen.

44:50.396 --> 44:52.772
Free clean power.
Would you like to know the future?

44:52.940 --> 44:55.274
The man speaking now
is going to change the world.

44:55.442 --> 45:00.279
Ladies and gentlemen, come one, come all.
Immediate seating, no waiting.

45:15.587 --> 45:18.715
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry...

45:18.882 --> 45:20.633
...but objections have been raised...

45:20.801 --> 45:24.178
...concerning the safety...
- They should be. Does that look safe to you?

45:24.346 --> 45:26.764
Part of Thomas Edison's
smear campaign...

45:26.932 --> 45:30.810
...against Mr. Tesla's
superior alternating current.

45:30.978 --> 45:32.520
Mr. Alley, please.

45:32.688 --> 45:35.189
We have asked Mr. Tesla
to reconsider...

45:35.357 --> 45:37.984
- Which he will not.
...his presentation.

45:38.152 --> 45:42.363
But I've been told he refuses
to appear under any such restrictions.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.825
Clear the hall!
This thing is gonna blow!

45:45.993 --> 45:48.619
- Clear the hall!
- Ladies and gentlemen, please!

45:49.288 --> 45:51.330
Where's the switch?

45:55.043 --> 45:57.503
This is all perfectly safe.

46:28.452 --> 46:29.494
Hey.

46:29.661 --> 46:31.204
Hello, you.

46:31.371 --> 46:34.165
Hello, Jess.

46:36.543 --> 46:39.337
Have you had a nice day with Mummy?

46:41.423 --> 46:44.550
Sarah, I love you.

46:44.718 --> 46:48.095
- See? Today it's true.
- Yeah.

46:48.263 --> 46:49.931
Hello.

46:50.974 --> 46:53.267
I saw happiness.

46:53.602 --> 46:56.562
Happiness that should have been mine.

46:56.730 --> 46:58.064
But I was wrong.

46:58.232 --> 47:02.819
His notebook reveals
that he never had the life that I enVied.

47:02.986 --> 47:05.321
The family life
that he craVes one minute...

47:05.489 --> 47:09.784
...he rails against the next,
demanding freedom.

47:09.952 --> 47:12.829
His mind...
His mind is a diVided one.

47:12.996 --> 47:14.831
His soul is restless.

47:14.998 --> 47:21.212
His wife and child tormented
by his fickle and contradictory nature.

47:24.967 --> 47:27.385
What do you think?
What do you think you'll call her?

47:27.553 --> 47:28.803
I don't know.

47:28.971 --> 47:31.222
Everybody needs a name.
So, what's hers?

47:32.140 --> 47:33.891
Maybe Sarah.

47:36.186 --> 47:38.646
That's a lovely name.
That's a lovely name.

47:38.814 --> 47:41.941
You talk about what you wanna do
for the rest of the day.

47:42.109 --> 47:43.901
All right? Go on. You talk with her.

47:46.446 --> 47:48.447
They're taking her away?

47:50.617 --> 47:51.617
To the workhouse?

47:54.872 --> 47:56.914
Now, you keep talking.

47:59.626 --> 48:02.795
Tell Owens I've reconsidered.
Take it. Go on, take it.

48:07.593 --> 48:09.635
It's for the best.

48:14.808 --> 48:16.642
Let me see.

48:17.895 --> 48:22.690
- I'm gonna learn all the Professor's secrets.
- Only if I teach you how to read.

48:23.317 --> 48:25.526
They're just stupid tricks, right?

48:25.694 --> 48:28.487
Haven't helped you
get out of here, have they?

48:29.239 --> 48:32.491
Or can't you undo real locks, Professor?

48:33.702 --> 48:36.370
Well, maybe I'm just biding my time.

48:36.538 --> 48:42.376
Maybe one day I'll open my hand,
get your attention, ask:

48:42.544 --> 48:44.629
"Are you watching closely?"

48:44.796 --> 48:47.548
Maybe a magic word or two.

48:49.468 --> 48:51.928
And then I'll be gone.

48:55.182 --> 48:58.434
How'd you get so famous, then, eh?

48:58.936 --> 49:00.561
Magic.

49:04.441 --> 49:05.858
Borden, get back here!

49:06.026 --> 49:07.526
Thank you.

49:08.153 --> 49:10.404
Shut up! Get him down!

49:10.906 --> 49:12.823
Thank you.

49:13.116 --> 49:14.992
Who's got a bloody key?

49:21.583 --> 49:24.085
February 8th, 1899.

49:24.252 --> 49:26.212
Today, finally a breakthrough.

49:26.880 --> 49:29.048
Tesla's agreed to see me.

49:36.807 --> 49:37.890
It's perfectly safe.

49:59.997 --> 50:03.082
So this is the Great Danton.

50:03.250 --> 50:07.920
Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me
on any number of occasions.

50:09.798 --> 50:11.257
Hold out other hand.

50:19.975 --> 50:21.809
What's conducting the electricity?

50:21.977 --> 50:25.271
Our bodies, Mr. Angier,
are quite capable of conducting...

50:25.439 --> 50:27.940
...and, indeed, producing energy.

50:29.526 --> 50:31.569
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

50:34.614 --> 50:36.615
I need something impossible.

50:38.452 --> 50:43.164
You are familiar with the phrase,
"Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

50:43.707 --> 50:44.957
It's a lie.

50:45.125 --> 50:47.084
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

50:48.211 --> 50:51.130
Society only tolerates
one change at a time.

50:52.632 --> 50:55.843
The first time
I tried to change the world...

50:56.011 --> 50:57.636
...I was hailed as a visionary.

50:58.263 --> 51:03.768
Second time,
I was asked politely to retire.

51:04.644 --> 51:07.730
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

51:08.273 --> 51:10.149
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.

51:10.317 --> 51:12.026
What you want is simply expensive.

51:12.652 --> 51:14.653
If I were to build for you this machine...

51:14.821 --> 51:17.490
...you would be presenting it
merely as illusion?

51:17.657 --> 51:20.993
Well, if people actually believed
the things I did on-stage...

51:21.161 --> 51:24.789
...they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.
I mean, think of sawing a woman in half.

51:24.956 --> 51:27.833
Mr. Angier, have you considered
the cost of such a machine?

51:28.001 --> 51:29.835
Price is not an object.

51:30.504 --> 51:33.839
Perhaps not,
but have you considered the cost?

51:34.883 --> 51:36.175
I'm not sure I follow.

51:37.260 --> 51:39.053
Go home. Forget this thing.

51:39.513 --> 51:41.347
I can recognize an obsession.

51:41.973 --> 51:43.516
No good will come of it.

51:43.683 --> 51:45.476
Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

51:46.144 --> 51:48.729
At first.
But I have followed them too long.

51:48.897 --> 51:54.360
I am their slave, and one day,
they will choose to destroy me.

51:55.904 --> 51:59.698
If you understand an obsession,
then you know you won't change my mind.

52:01.034 --> 52:02.034
So be it.

52:03.662 --> 52:04.870
Will you build it?

52:05.914 --> 52:09.416
I have already begun to build it,
Mr. Angier.

52:09.584 --> 52:11.961
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.463
This will take some time.

52:38.488 --> 52:40.364
I thought you'd gone.

52:41.324 --> 52:43.492
I don't really have anywhere to go.

52:46.371 --> 52:47.621
You've been sleeping here?

52:47.789 --> 52:52.209
Cutter said it would be all right till we get
another booking. What are you doing?

52:53.253 --> 52:54.587
Research.

52:54.754 --> 52:59.216
Part of a magician's job is to watch
his competition, to see what illusions...

52:59.384 --> 53:02.136
You're going to do something
to that man, aren't you?

53:02.304 --> 53:04.096
Cutter's hoping you'll let things lie.

53:04.264 --> 53:06.932
He says if Borden thinks things
are even between you two...

53:07.100 --> 53:08.475
Even?

53:09.060 --> 53:11.604
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

53:11.771 --> 53:14.648
He has a family now, right?
And he's performing again.

53:14.816 --> 53:18.569
Borden is living his life just as he always
intended, as if nothing had happened.

53:18.737 --> 53:20.779
And look at... Look at me, all right?

53:20.947 --> 53:23.824
- I'm alone and no theater will touch me.
- Us.

53:24.784 --> 53:27.453
You're going to need a better disguise.

53:44.596 --> 53:45.638
Need a volunteer.

53:47.057 --> 53:48.349
What happened?

53:49.476 --> 53:51.518
Did you hurt him?

53:53.188 --> 53:54.438
What happened, Robert?

53:56.858 --> 53:58.275
You, sir.

53:58.985 --> 54:01.820
Just a rubber ball, yes? Thank you.

54:01.988 --> 54:04.490
Just a rubber ball, no.

54:04.658 --> 54:07.826
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

54:07.994 --> 54:09.036
It's magic.

54:09.871 --> 54:11.830
He had a new trick.

54:25.720 --> 54:26.720
Was it good?

54:31.851 --> 54:34.270
It was the greatest magic trick
I've ever seen.

54:40.360 --> 54:41.860
Did they applaud when you saw it?

54:42.028 --> 54:44.071
The trick was too good,
it was too simple.

54:44.239 --> 54:47.324
- The audience hardly had time to see it.
- He's a dreadful magician.

54:47.492 --> 54:50.035
No, he's a wonderful magician.
He's a dreadful showman.

54:50.203 --> 54:52.413
He doesn't know how to dress it up,
how to sell...

54:52.580 --> 54:54.206
- How does he do it?
- Uses a double.

54:54.374 --> 54:57.001
No, no, no, it's too simple.
This is a complex illusion.

54:57.168 --> 54:59.545
You only say that
because you don't know the method.

54:59.713 --> 55:01.880
It's a double at the end.
It's the only way.

55:02.048 --> 55:04.216
I've seen him perform the trick
three times now.

55:04.384 --> 55:06.885
- The Prestige is the same man.
- No, it's not.

55:07.053 --> 55:09.513
The same man comes out
of that second cabinet.

55:09.681 --> 55:10.764
It's the same man.

55:12.017 --> 55:14.393
He wears padded gloves
to hide his damaged fingers...

55:14.561 --> 55:16.437
...but if you look closely you can tell.

55:19.232 --> 55:21.859
He doesn't know how to sell it
to an audience, but I do.

55:22.027 --> 55:24.361
Yeah, well, we can use it
as a climax to the show.

55:24.779 --> 55:26.655
Yes.

55:26.823 --> 55:30.075
The man stole my life,
I'm gonna steal his trick.

55:30.243 --> 55:33.412
- We gotta find someone who looks like you.
- He doesn't use a double.

55:33.580 --> 55:36.915
Robert, I don't know
how Borden does the trick, so either...

55:37.083 --> 55:40.461
You either wait for him to retire
and buy the secret...

55:40.628 --> 55:42.421
...or you listen to how I would do it.

55:42.589 --> 55:47.468
And the only way that I know how to do it
is to find you a bloody good double.

55:48.428 --> 55:50.054
All right.

55:51.306 --> 55:53.807
Take a good look.
Let's get out there and find me.

55:56.019 --> 55:57.936
Look. Look.

56:02.067 --> 56:03.650
What's that?

56:04.819 --> 56:07.946
That is for you.

56:08.114 --> 56:09.865
What's this for?

56:10.033 --> 56:11.658
Come here.

56:16.831 --> 56:20.584
- I asked you last week. You said you...
- You caught me in a wrong mood.

56:20.794 --> 56:22.127
But you went over all the...

56:22.295 --> 56:25.839
Sarah, I'm allowed to change my mind,
aren't I?

56:26.341 --> 56:29.760
The act is taking off,
soon we'll be in a bigger theater.

56:29.928 --> 56:31.136
Things will work out.

56:33.598 --> 56:35.307
I can't believe it. Thank you.

56:35.475 --> 56:37.351
Thank you. It's beautiful.

56:44.067 --> 56:45.818
Gerry?

56:46.236 --> 56:47.236
Darling, look at you.

56:47.404 --> 56:50.155
Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier,
I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

56:55.328 --> 56:58.705
A pleasure.
Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.

56:59.290 --> 57:03.168
Would you like for me
to tell you a little joke? Come here.

57:05.004 --> 57:07.005
There we are. Yes?

57:07.173 --> 57:09.174
Are you laughing now?

57:11.386 --> 57:14.179
Oh, dear, I have to take a piss.

57:15.890 --> 57:18.684
- He's out of his mind.
- Of course. He's an out-of-work actor.

57:18.852 --> 57:20.686
He's perfect. He needs a little help...

57:20.854 --> 57:23.689
...but when I get done with him,
he could be your brother.

57:23.857 --> 57:26.358
I don't need him to be my brother,
I need him to be me.

57:26.526 --> 57:28.152
Give me a month.

57:32.031 --> 57:33.866
Come around.

57:35.034 --> 57:39.371
So you open the door and...

57:46.629 --> 57:48.213
Come on.

57:52.093 --> 57:55.846
- Couldn't you have found a softer one?
- Well, it's not for sleeping on.

57:56.431 --> 57:58.390
So if you come down through there...

58:01.102 --> 58:04.104
...does Root go up through there?
- Yep.

58:04.522 --> 58:06.231
It's going to be amazing, Robert.

58:06.774 --> 58:10.569
Well, it has to be.
Borden's trick is getting noticed.

58:12.614 --> 58:14.990
The place was packed today.

58:16.659 --> 58:18.410
You went and saw his show again.

58:18.578 --> 58:20.913
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

58:29.589 --> 58:31.590
All I have to do is keep myself drunk...

58:31.758 --> 58:34.051
...and no one will be able
to tell the difference.

58:34.219 --> 58:36.094
Have a little faith, sir.

58:36.262 --> 58:41.141
Now, would you favor us
with a performance, Mr. Root?

58:45.063 --> 58:46.480
Jesus.

59:01.871 --> 59:05.082
Yes, you would drink too
if you knew the world half as well as I do.

59:08.920 --> 59:10.462
Did you think you were unique?

59:10.630 --> 59:13.131
I have been Caesar. I played Faust.

59:13.299 --> 59:16.301
How difficult could it possibly be
to play the Great Danton?

59:16.469 --> 59:19.638
You can go back to being yourself now,
Root, for nothing.

59:19.806 --> 59:21.974
I'd rather be him for now.

59:22.141 --> 59:24.935
I find it amusing.

59:28.314 --> 59:32.401
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.

59:33.528 --> 59:35.445
- You look wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

59:35.613 --> 59:38.699
Root has to keep a low profile.
Anyone sees him, the game's up.

59:38.866 --> 59:41.827
I don't know how you do these things.
I'm not sure I wanna know.

59:42.036 --> 59:44.162
Have you thought
what we should call the trick?

59:44.330 --> 59:45.789
There's no point in being coy.

59:46.040 --> 59:48.125
Borden calls his trick
"The Transported Man."

59:52.422 --> 59:55.007
Ladies and gentlemen,
much of what you've seen tonight...

59:55.174 --> 01:00:00.429
...may be termed as illusions
or entertaining trifles.

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:05.183
Alas...

01:00:07.353 --> 01:00:09.813
...I cannot claim
this next feat as illusion.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:11.857
Watch carefully.

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:15.819
You'll see no trickery...

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.863
...for no trickery is employed.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:22.367
Merely a technique familiar
to certain citizens of the Orient...

01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:24.703
...and various holy men
of the Himalayas.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:30.876
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique...

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:34.087
...but for those of you who aren't,
do not be alarmed...

01:00:34.255 --> 01:00:37.341
...what you're about to see
is considered safe.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:11.416
To our achievement.

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:14.753
The manager says
he's never seen a reaction like it.

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:18.131
At least he got to see it.
I spent the ovation hiding under the stage.

01:01:18.299 --> 01:01:20.717
No one cares about the man
who disappears into the box.

01:01:20.885 --> 01:01:22.636
They care about the one who comes out.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:25.597
- I care about the man in the box.
- Thank you.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:29.101
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe we could switch before the trick.

01:01:29.268 --> 01:01:31.436
I could be the Prestige
and Root ends up below.

01:01:31.604 --> 01:01:34.272
No, the anticipation of the trick
is everything.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.484
We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:40.946
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:43.949
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:47.619
Root, you bloody fool.
Get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:50.288
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

01:01:50.456 --> 01:01:52.457
Congratulations, all.

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:56.211
Life is not full of these moments, Robbie.
We worked hard.

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:57.963
We need to celebrate properly.

01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:04.177
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

01:02:04.345 --> 01:02:06.596
No. No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:09.975
Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours.
He has no style.

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:13.979
Well, he doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:15.814
I need to know how he does it.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:19.359
- Why?
- So I can do it better.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.488
I need you to go and work for him.

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.785
Work for him? Are you joking?

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:31.204
You'll be my spy.

01:02:31.372 --> 01:02:33.457
We just got our start.
You want me to leave?

01:02:33.624 --> 01:02:35.667
That's how we advance.
Think of it, Olivia.

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:39.463
We got people excited, but imagine
what we could do with the real illusion.

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:43.467
We'd have the greatest magic act
anyone's ever seen.

01:02:43.634 --> 01:02:45.010
He knows I work for you.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:48.472
Exactly why he'll wanna hire you.
He'll want my secret.

01:02:48.639 --> 01:02:52.684
- Why would he trust me?
- Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:06.072
Good girl.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:12.829
You must be curious to see what
so much money has bought you, Mr. Angier.

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:16.333
It's fitting you should be here
for maiden voyage.

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:18.210
Your hat.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.553
You might wanna stand back.

01:03:49.408 --> 01:03:50.408
I don't understand.

01:03:50.576 --> 01:03:52.869
Perhaps it would be best
if you left us to it.

01:03:53.037 --> 01:03:55.163
- Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?
- No, no, no.

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:56.873
- Come back next week.
- Next week?

01:03:57.041 --> 01:03:59.125
- Come back... Next week, it'll be fine.
- Tesla.

01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:02.087
She's just a little temperamental
sometimes.

01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:09.761
- Interesting workshop.
- Yeah, we make do.

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:12.264
- My name is Olivia Wenscombe...
- I know who you are.

01:04:12.431 --> 01:04:13.765
You here to steal my show?

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:15.725
I'm here to give it what it's missing.

01:04:15.893 --> 01:04:19.062
- Yeah? What might that be?
- Me.

01:04:20.606 --> 01:04:24.568
I was just saying that, wasn't I, Bernard?
Woman's touch.

01:04:24.735 --> 01:04:26.570
- I've left Angier.
- All right.

01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:29.447
- I want a job.
- Yeah?

01:04:29.615 --> 01:04:32.617
- I know you've no reason to trust me...
- Why wouldn't I trust you?

01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:36.621
I mean, you're only the mistress
of my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:40.125
- Mr. Borden...
- Alfred.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.129
I'm going to tell you the truth.

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:47.465
Now that is a slippery notion
in our line of work...

01:04:47.633 --> 01:04:48.925
...isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.638
I am here because he sent me here.

01:04:53.806 --> 01:04:56.266
He wants me to work for you
and steal your secret.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.101
What does he need my secret for?

01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:59.644
His trick is top-notch.

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:03.481
He vanishes and then he reappears
on the other side of the stage...

01:05:03.649 --> 01:05:07.485
...mute, overweight and,
unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

01:05:07.653 --> 01:05:09.321
It's astonishing. How does he do it?

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:14.659
And tell me, Olivia, does he enjoy
taking his bows under the stage?

01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:15.827
No, it's killing him.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:17.996
He's obsessed
with discovering your methods.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:19.372
He thinks of nothing else.

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:22.626
He takes no pleasure in our success,
and I've had enough.

01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:24.210
There is no future with him.

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:30.050
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:34.137
This is the truth, is it?

01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:40.352
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:42.729
Root, you're late
and more drunk than usual.

01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:45.523
- Now, get down below stairs right away.
- No.

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:50.195
No, we need to have
a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:51.404
We have a problem.

01:05:51.572 --> 01:05:54.157
Cutter, Borden is performing
right across the street.

01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:56.952
Yeah? We have a bigger problem.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:01.039
Root. He's realized
he can make demands.

01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:03.208
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:07.545
I was surprised, to tell you the truth.
It usually takes them longer to figure it out.

01:06:07.713 --> 01:06:10.507
- Well, how much does he want?
- Well, it makes no difference.

01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:14.052
- We gotta stop doing the trick.
- Stop the trick? Cutter, look at this.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.388
Well, look at yesterday's,
look at last week...

01:06:16.555 --> 01:06:19.891
...where they said you were
the premier stage performer in London.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:21.643
Not magician, mind you.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:24.396
- Performer of any kind.
- Well, what's your point?

01:06:24.563 --> 01:06:26.856
My point is, Robert,
is you've climbed too high...

01:06:27.024 --> 01:06:29.234
...to get away
with professional embarrassment.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:32.612
We don't do any tricks we can't control.

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.616
Just pay him whatever he wants for now.

01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:40.203
We keep doing the trick until Borden opens
and then we'll phase it out.

01:06:41.288 --> 01:06:42.747
All right.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:49.421
Cutter was always surprised
how fast Root turned bad.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:54.009
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this rather welcome pint of ale?

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:57.554
You're the Great Danton, aren't you?

01:06:57.722 --> 01:07:01.057
Of course I am, but don't advertise it
because I'll be mobbed with fans.

01:07:01.225 --> 01:07:03.101
We paid him enough
to keep him in beers...

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:05.437
...so you wouldn't expect him
to rock the boat.

01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:08.148
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique.

01:07:08.315 --> 01:07:11.943
But for those of you who aren't,
do not be alarmed...

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:15.155
...what you're about to see
is considered safe.

01:07:15.322 --> 01:07:16.614
And who are you?

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:22.620
I am a humble admirer
and a fellow practitioner.

01:07:22.788 --> 01:07:23.955
Very good.

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:36.134
- Another?
- Oh, if you insist.

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.219
- Another.
- I'm not performing tonight.

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:40.138
Well, I'm only doing one show...

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:43.475
...but to be frank, my people
pretty much run things these days.

01:07:43.642 --> 01:07:44.768
Get up there!

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:47.228
Get up!

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:49.564
Your illusion, The Transported Man...

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.692
...l'm not claiming
to know your methods or anything...

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:59.866
...but I had a similar trick in my act,
and I used a double.

01:08:01.285 --> 01:08:02.368
I see. Very good.

01:08:02.536 --> 01:08:05.121
Well, it was, and then it went bad.

01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:10.668
What I didn't count on, was that
when I incorporated this bloke into my act...

01:08:10.836 --> 01:08:12.837
...he had complete power over me.

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:15.632
Complete power, you say.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:38.363
Be very careful giving someone
that power over you.

01:08:40.741 --> 01:08:42.700
Well, thank you.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:45.161
Yes, thank you for the warning.

01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:49.332
Cheers.

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:52.042
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:56.421
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:38.631
The Great Danton.

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.680
I apologize.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:50.602
There simply is too much magic...

01:09:50.769 --> 01:09:55.773
...for my stage at the Pantages
across the street.

01:09:57.109 --> 01:09:59.652
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:03.239
Pardon my intrusion.

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:06.743
- Bravo!
- And go easy on the poor chap.

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:09.996
He does try so very hard.

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.459
I don't know how Borden found him.

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:16.294
Kept him under wraps, I was careful.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:18.504
Yeah, well, he did.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.465
Do you think it was her?

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.516
You weren't expecting me?

01:10:30.684 --> 01:10:33.353
I was expecting you sooner.
Your message said afternoon.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.647
It takes a bit
for me to get around these days.

01:10:35.981 --> 01:10:37.649
He's taken everything from me.

01:10:37.816 --> 01:10:40.485
My wife, my career, now you.

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:42.028
What do you mean?
You sent me...

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.864
I sent you to steal his secret,
not to improve his act.

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:46.491
- That's my job.
- Or fall in love.

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:49.244
- I did everything you asked!
- Yes? Yes?

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.955
- Then how does he do it?
- Cutter was right, a double.

01:10:52.122 --> 01:10:55.375
- Of course Borden said that.
- He didn't say anything. I've seen things.

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:59.337
Makeup, glasses, wigs. We don't use it
for the show, but I've seen it backstage.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:03.216
It's misdirection. He leaves things around
to make you think he's using a double.

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:05.301
All the time?
He doesn't know when I look.

01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:07.345
All the time, Olivia!

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:09.847
That's who he is! That's what it takes!

01:11:10.015 --> 01:11:12.350
He lives his act! Don't you see?

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.689
Just because you're sleeping with him
doesn't mean he trusts you.

01:11:17.856 --> 01:11:20.191
You think you can see everything,
don't you?

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:24.028
But the Great Danton is a blind fool.
His notebook.

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:28.199
You stole it?

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:30.159
I borrowed it for tonight.

01:11:30.327 --> 01:11:32.287
I thought you could translate it,
but now...

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:33.538
- I can't.
- You can't?

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:36.541
Olivia, no one can, it's a cipher.

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:39.627
Even with the keyword
it would take months to decode.

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:43.047
- And without the keyword?
- Perhaps never.

01:11:43.215 --> 01:11:44.632
- We'll see.
- We will not see.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.719
If I don't get that back to him tomorrow,
he'll know I took it.

01:11:47.886 --> 01:11:50.054
- Leave him.
- I can't. He knows where I live.

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:53.391
This is his diary, Olivia.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.227
All of his secrets
are right here in my hands.

01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:58.438
Won't bring your wife back.

01:11:58.605 --> 01:12:01.774
I don't care about my wife,
I care about his secret.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.414
Look...

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:19.584
...l'll go to his workshop
and stage a break-in.

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:23.921
- He'll know you took it.
- Yes, me. Not you.

01:12:24.089 --> 01:12:25.882
Understand?

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.017
Robert.

01:12:37.978 --> 01:12:40.646
I have fallen in love with him.

01:12:41.648 --> 01:12:44.359
Then I know how hard
this has been for you.

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:53.951
Notebook?

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:58.748
Then he's just getting started.

01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:30.780
- Good evening.
- Professor.

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:33.699
Professor.

01:13:34.159 --> 01:13:35.952
- I...
- Could I get your autograph?

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.578
- I'm walking tonight.
- Professor.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.539
Let him come. I don't care.

01:13:39.706 --> 01:13:42.125
- Professor.
- Professor.

01:15:06.877 --> 01:15:09.337
- You all right?
- I'm alive.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.589
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:28.147
- I'm impressed.
- Why's that?

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:30.816
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.153
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

01:15:34.321 --> 01:15:35.655
Risk.

01:15:35.822 --> 01:15:37.073
Sacrifice.

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:41.285
The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is gonna be yours,
unless you give me what I want.

01:15:42.746 --> 01:15:44.789
- Which is?
- Your secret.

01:15:45.332 --> 01:15:47.208
My secret?

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.627
Your method for The Transported Man.

01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:52.421
Fallon wouldn't tell me.
He doesn't seem to talk at all.

01:15:52.589 --> 01:15:53.839
You have my notebook.

01:15:54.007 --> 01:15:55.967
Useless without the keyword.

01:15:57.469 --> 01:15:59.095
Write down your method, Mr. Borden.

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:01.138
Describe it in full.

01:16:14.194 --> 01:16:16.821
I want the whole method,
not the keyword.

01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:19.365
I don't even know
if your secret's in your notebook.

01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:21.826
The keyword is the method.

01:16:25.622 --> 01:16:26.789
Where's my ingénieur?

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:36.507
- Alive?
- How fast can you dig?

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:42.054
Fallon! You hear me? Fallon!

01:16:43.473 --> 01:16:46.017
- How's the arm?
- Still attached.

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.895
- Did you find your answer?
- Our answer.

01:16:50.063 --> 01:16:52.857
Cutter, I haven't looked yet.
I wanted you to share this.

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:55.526
I already know how he does it, Robert.

01:16:55.694 --> 01:16:58.529
The same way he always has.
The same way as we do.

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:01.073
It's just that you want something more.

01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:02.867
Well, let's find out then,
shall we?

01:17:08.373 --> 01:17:09.665
What does it mean?

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:20.009
It means, Cutter,
we have a journey ahead of us.

01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:22.887
- To America.
- Robert?

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:25.222
Listen to me.

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:29.518
Obsession is a young man's game.

01:17:29.686 --> 01:17:33.606
- Oh, come on.
- I can't follow you any further in it.

01:17:34.858 --> 01:17:36.567
I can't. I'm sorry.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:42.406
Then the rest is up to me.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.118
I'm sorry.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:54.752
Good evening. Hello, darling.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.545
Champagne, your finest.

01:17:57.255 --> 01:17:59.674
I didn't know we were
going to be joined for dinner.

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:02.760
- Absolutely. We are celebrating.
- Miss Wenscombe.

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:05.888
Mr. Fallon.
Well, what are we celebrating?

01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:08.474
Well, we've hit upon a new trick,
haven't we, Fallon?

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:11.560
- What trick, Freddy?
- Yes, Freddy, what trick?

01:18:11.728 --> 01:18:15.981
I am going to bury myself alive
every night...

01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:19.944
...and then someone will come along
and dig me up. Wonderful.

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:23.989
- No, I think my husband's had quite enough.
- No, pour the champagne. Come on, pour...

01:18:24.157 --> 01:18:26.909
Right. Sarah, don't talk to me like that.
I'm not a child.

01:18:27.077 --> 01:18:29.036
- Perhaps it would...
- Perhaps, Mr. Fallon...

01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:32.289
...you might escort Miss Wenscombe home.
My husband's being a bore.

01:18:32.457 --> 01:18:36.001
- I see no reason why you have to suffer.
- Oh, please. Don't ruin this evening.

01:18:39.464 --> 01:18:43.008
Good night, Mrs. Borden.
Good night, Freddy.

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:48.973
- "Freddy"?
- Well, that's my name.

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:53.394
- Not at home.
- Well, I'm not always at home, am I?

01:18:54.354 --> 01:18:57.398
Well, couldn't you have at least
taken off the beard?

01:18:57.566 --> 01:19:01.110
Sarah, I just came from
the bloody theater just now.

01:19:01.278 --> 01:19:02.987
All right? And I'm out in public.

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:06.282
- Everybody else loves it.
- Why are you being like this, Alfred?

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:09.201
I had a terrible ordeal today.

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:13.998
I thought that something very precious...

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:16.083
...had been lost to me.

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:19.336
So I just wanted to celebrate.
Just a little.

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:21.797
All right, what?

01:19:21.965 --> 01:19:23.674
What did you lose?

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:29.638
I see, more secrets.

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:33.684
Sarah, secrets are my life.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:37.772
- Our life.
- No, Alfred, stop.

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:41.484
This isn't you. Stop performing.

01:20:05.717 --> 01:20:08.219
I thought I had the place
to myself, Mr. Brent.

01:20:08.386 --> 01:20:09.762
Unexpected guests.

01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:13.390
Not very polite. A lot of questions.

01:20:13.558 --> 01:20:16.185
First I thought they might work
for the government.

01:20:16.353 --> 01:20:18.229
- No?
- Worse.

01:20:18.396 --> 01:20:20.564
They work for Thomas Edison.

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:24.360
Today, a most curious development.

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:28.572
His assistant came to us
with a proposition.

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:32.618
Obviously, Angier has sent her
and told her to admit as much.

01:20:32.786 --> 01:20:35.538
Does he enjoy taking
his bows under the stage?

01:20:35.705 --> 01:20:39.375
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

01:20:39.876 --> 01:20:43.420
This is the truth, is it?

01:20:51.596 --> 01:20:54.890
No, that's what he told me to tell you.
The truth...

01:20:55.058 --> 01:20:58.853
...is that I loved him, and I stood by him,
and he sent me to you...

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:02.398
...like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts.

01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:05.234
I hate him for that.

01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:09.405
I can spot Angier's methods
from the back of the theater.

01:21:10.574 --> 01:21:12.616
So, what could you possibly
have to offer me?

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:15.870
You know how he does his tricks,
but you can't understand...

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:18.497
...why no one can see yours are better.
You hide this.

01:21:18.665 --> 01:21:22.626
I had to look very closely to spot it when
you were performing The Transported Man...

01:21:22.794 --> 01:21:25.421
...but this makes you unique.

01:21:25.589 --> 01:21:27.756
It shows the audience
you aren't using a double.

01:21:27.924 --> 01:21:30.009
You mustn't hide it,
display it proudly.

01:21:30.176 --> 01:21:34.471
I'm sure it takes great skill
to perform illusions with one good hand.

01:21:34.931 --> 01:21:36.974
Yeah, it does.

01:21:38.476 --> 01:21:41.061
So let people know.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:45.482
You could be so much more than he is,
and I can show you how.

01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:48.777
I think she's telling the truth.

01:21:49.654 --> 01:21:51.780
I think we cannot trust her.

01:21:55.368 --> 01:21:57.786
But I loVe her. I need her.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.166
To open myself to such a relationship...

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:06.170
...to the dangers of such an affair...

01:22:06.671 --> 01:22:11.050
...I need assurances of fidelity. Of love.

01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:13.677
But how to be sure?

01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:20.309
I know a way.
It's the only way to know her mind.

01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:22.144
How could he send you away?

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:25.856
She must help me rid ourselves
of Angier.

01:22:33.823 --> 01:22:36.617
Today, my mistress proves
her truthfulness.

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.036
Not to me, you understand.

01:22:39.245 --> 01:22:41.246
I'Ve been conVinced
since she led me to Root.

01:22:41.414 --> 01:22:47.211
Today, Olivia proves her love for me
to you, Angier.

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:49.254
Yes, Angier.

01:22:49.422 --> 01:22:51.715
She gave you this notebook
at my request.

01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:57.054
And, yes, "Tesla" is merely the key
to my diary, not to my trick.

01:22:57.222 --> 01:23:01.767
Did you really think I'd part
with my secret so easily after so much?

01:23:01.935 --> 01:23:03.185
Goodbye, Angier.

01:23:03.353 --> 01:23:07.439
May you find solace for your thwarted
ambition back in your American home.

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:19.243
Tesla!

01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:25.124
Tesla! Alley! Alley!

01:23:25.291 --> 01:23:27.710
Tesla never made a machine
like the one I asked for.

01:23:27.877 --> 01:23:30.587
- We never said he had.
- But you let me believe that he had.

01:23:30.755 --> 01:23:33.424
You stole my money because
your funding had been cut off.

01:23:33.591 --> 01:23:37.344
You've been shooting sparks at my top hat,
laughing at me all along...

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:39.972
...while using my money
to stave off ruin.

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:42.933
- Now, I have seen Edison's men.
- Where?

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:46.103
In the hotel. And I have every mind
to bring them up here myself.

01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:48.272
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.483
It is true that you are
our last remaining financier...

01:23:51.651 --> 01:23:53.444
...but we have not stolen your money.

01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:54.945
Sir, my cat.

01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:58.115
When I told you I could make
your machine, I spoke a simple truth.

01:23:58.283 --> 01:24:01.702
- Then why isn't the machine working?
- Because exact science, Mr. Angier...

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:03.120
...is not an exact science.

01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:06.415
The machine simply does not operate
as expected.

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:08.834
It requires further examination.

01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:11.628
- So where did my top hat go?
- Nowhere.

01:24:11.796 --> 01:24:14.548
We tried the damn thing a dozen times.

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:16.050
The hat went nowhere.

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:18.135
We need to try different material.

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:21.972
It may provoke a different result.

01:24:22.932 --> 01:24:24.600
Copernicus, come on.

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:36.278
You are responsible for whatever happens
to this animal, doctor.

01:24:57.342 --> 01:25:01.011
I hope that whatever you were really doing
with my money was more worthwhile...

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:03.138
...Mr. Tesla.

01:25:58.236 --> 01:25:59.236
Alley!

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:03.907
So the machine was working.

01:26:04.075 --> 01:26:07.578
I never bothered to check the calibration
because the hat never moved.

01:26:07.745 --> 01:26:10.831
These things never quite work
as you expect them to, Mr. Angier.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:13.167
That's one of the principal
beauties of science.

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:16.712
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out
the problems with the machine.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.089
We'll send word when it's ready.

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:23.385
Don't forget your hat.

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:27.973
- Well, which one is mine?
- They're all your hats, Mr. Angier.

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:36.899
You look so pretty
in this new dress of yours.

01:26:37.066 --> 01:26:40.944
- Are we going to the zoo this afternoon?
- No, no, no. Daddy has some errands to run.

01:26:41.112 --> 01:26:43.113
- But you promised.
- I promised, did I?

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:45.449
Then go to the zoo we shall.

01:26:45.617 --> 01:26:48.911
So Daddy will go run his errands
and I'll be back before you know it...

01:26:49.078 --> 01:26:52.789
...so you go get ready.
We'll go see those chimpanzees.

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:58.003
Sarah.

01:26:58.379 --> 01:26:59.421
What are you doing?

01:27:02.967 --> 01:27:06.094
We each of us have our vices.

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:12.559
Sarah, whatever you may think...

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:16.647
...your only competition for my affections
is our little girl.

01:27:16.814 --> 01:27:21.151
I love you. I will always love you
and you alone.

01:27:23.196 --> 01:27:26.406
- You mean it today.
- Absolutely.

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:30.535
Which makes it so much harder
when you don't.

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:42.965
Is that more shopping?
She does love the smell of money.

01:27:43.132 --> 01:27:46.468
The little lady wants to go to the zoo,
so I thought you could take her.

01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:49.721
Yeah? I mean,
I can do it tomorrow if not.

01:27:49.889 --> 01:27:55.352
And Sarah, she knows.

01:27:56.187 --> 01:27:59.398
She... I mean, at least she knows
that something's not right...

01:27:59.565 --> 01:28:03.026
...so if you can just do whatever you can
to help me with her.

01:28:03.194 --> 01:28:07.155
Talk to her. Just convince her
that I do love her.

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:22.170
- What is it, Freddy?
- Just don't call me that, please.

01:28:22.338 --> 01:28:24.881
It's nothing. It's just, you know,
there's sometimes...

01:28:25.049 --> 01:28:27.384
- Sometimes it seems wrong.
- I've told you before...

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:29.094
...when you're with me,
you're with me.

01:28:29.262 --> 01:28:31.305
Leave your family at home
where they belong.

01:28:31.931 --> 01:28:33.390
I'm trying.

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.058
I'm trying, Olivia.

01:28:35.226 --> 01:28:37.728
- I'll get dressed.
- Yeah.

01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:41.898
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:44.568
There's something
about that man I don't trust.

01:28:44.902 --> 01:28:47.738
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:50.449
He protects the things that I care about.

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:31.114
We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

01:29:31.282 --> 01:29:33.825
We were sorry to see
Mr. Tesla leave as well.

01:29:33.993 --> 01:29:35.994
He was very good to Colorado Springs.

01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:42.459
Mr. Angier, I didn't think it was necessary
to tell Edison's men about the box.

01:29:43.127 --> 01:29:44.127
What box?

01:30:09.612 --> 01:30:12.948
I apologize for leaving
without saying goodbye...

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:17.577
...but I seem to have outstayed
my welcome in Colorado.

01:30:18.329 --> 01:30:22.791
The truly extraordinary is not
permitted in science and industry.

01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:28.380
Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field,
where people are happy to be mystified.

01:30:28.548 --> 01:30:32.467
You will find what
you are looking for in this box.

01:30:32.885 --> 01:30:36.930
Alley has written you
a thorough set of instructions.

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:41.726
I add only one suggestion
on using the machine:

01:30:41.894 --> 01:30:43.854
Destroy it.

01:30:44.021 --> 01:30:47.107
Drop it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:50.485
Such a thing will bring you only misery.

01:30:54.532 --> 01:30:58.076
Tesla's warning is as unheeded
as he knew it would be.

01:30:58.244 --> 01:31:00.203
Today, I tested the machine...

01:31:00.371 --> 01:31:04.833
...taking precautions in case Tesla
hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation.

01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:09.838
I mean, if it went wrong,
I would not wanna live like that for long.

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:32.527
But here at the Turn,
I must leave you, Borden.

01:31:32.695 --> 01:31:34.863
Yes, you, Borden.

01:31:35.031 --> 01:31:37.240
Sitting there in your cell...

01:31:37.408 --> 01:31:41.453
...reading my diary, awaiting your death...

01:31:41.621 --> 01:31:43.705
...for my murder.

01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:52.088
Angier's journal, that gesture
of good faith, that's a fake.

01:31:52.256 --> 01:31:56.259
I assure you, it's not. The provenance
of the journal is clear and under no doubt.

01:31:56.427 --> 01:32:00.972
And it's written in Angier's own hand,
of which we had numerous examples.

01:32:02.934 --> 01:32:04.726
It don't matter.

01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:09.689
So my tricks.

01:32:12.068 --> 01:32:15.737
- All of them.
- Including The Transported Man?

01:32:16.572 --> 01:32:18.865
Well, Lord Caldlow
will be very pleased indeed.

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:22.536
No, he won't.
Because they're not complete.

01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:25.288
It's just the Pledge
and the Turn for each.

01:32:25.456 --> 01:32:28.083
Without the Prestige for these tricks...

01:32:28.668 --> 01:32:31.002
...these are worthless.
- Yeah.

01:32:31.671 --> 01:32:35.131
You get the rest of it
when you bring my daughter here.

01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:40.095
I wanna say goodbye.

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:43.306
We have to go through it now.

01:32:43.474 --> 01:32:46.017
Listen, we have to go through it now.
Now, listen to me.

01:32:46.185 --> 01:32:47.477
Deny it all you want.

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:49.938
Olivia means nothing.

01:32:50.106 --> 01:32:51.481
- Olivia?
- I need an assistant.

01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:52.774
No, I'll go to her.

01:32:52.942 --> 01:32:54.693
- I'll tell her I know...
- Tell her what?

01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:58.530
I know what you really are, Alfred. I...

01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:00.949
- I know, and I...
- Sarah, Sarah.

01:33:01.117 --> 01:33:03.368
- I can't keep it in.
- You can't talk like this.

01:33:03.536 --> 01:33:04.536
Sarah, shut up.

01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:05.996
- No, no.
- Sarah, shut up!

01:33:06.330 --> 01:33:07.998
I don't wanna hear it anymore!

01:33:08.165 --> 01:33:11.167
You can't talk like this!

01:33:12.878 --> 01:33:15.964
You can't hide it anymore
because I know, Alfred, I know.

01:33:16.132 --> 01:33:17.841
I know what you really are!

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:19.676
Alfred...

01:33:19.844 --> 01:33:22.554
...I can't live like this.

01:33:22.722 --> 01:33:24.681
Oh, well, you think I can live like this?

01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:28.018
You think I bloody enjoy living like this?

01:33:28.185 --> 01:33:30.770
- Stop it and listen! No!
- We have this beautiful house...

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:34.190
...lovely little girl, we're married.
What is so wrong with your life?

01:33:34.358 --> 01:33:36.860
Alfred, I can't live like this!

01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:39.904
Well, what do you want from me?

01:33:44.535 --> 01:33:46.202
I want...

01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:49.497
I want you to be honest with me.

01:33:52.376 --> 01:33:54.210
No tricks...

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:58.256
...no lies...

01:33:58.507 --> 01:34:01.676
...and no secrets.

01:34:07.266 --> 01:34:10.602
Do you...? Do you love me?

01:34:13.439 --> 01:34:15.190
Not today.

01:34:17.234 --> 01:34:18.234
No.

01:35:56.167 --> 01:35:58.168
Who's there?

01:36:00.296 --> 01:36:02.088
I'm looking for an old friend.

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:03.381
I heard about a booking.

01:36:04.175 --> 01:36:06.885
Nice little theater.
Good up-and-coming magician.

01:36:07.052 --> 01:36:09.345
- You're back.
- It's good to see you, John.

01:36:10.306 --> 01:36:12.891
Good rehearsal space.

01:36:13.058 --> 01:36:15.685
Blind stagehands, I like it.

01:36:15.853 --> 01:36:18.313
You always had
a good eye for publicity.

01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:19.856
I need your help, John.

01:36:20.357 --> 01:36:22.692
It's my last show. A limited engagement.

01:36:23.152 --> 01:36:24.402
Your last show?

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:28.406
A wise man once told me
obsession was a young man's game.

01:36:28.574 --> 01:36:29.574
I'm almost done.

01:36:30.534 --> 01:36:32.327
There's one thing left.

01:36:33.370 --> 01:36:35.747
The Real Transported Man.

01:36:37.666 --> 01:36:39.584
You wanna design a show around it.

01:36:39.752 --> 01:36:42.545
I don't want you backstage.
I need you front of house, managing.

01:36:42.713 --> 01:36:45.256
I need you to call in favors
or connections you have...

01:36:45.424 --> 01:36:49.010
...to get us the right booking for the run.
- What sort of booking you after?

01:36:49.178 --> 01:36:51.387
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

01:36:59.438 --> 01:37:01.523
What an honor it is to see you again, sir.

01:37:01.690 --> 01:37:05.026
You told me you only wanted to show me
one trick. It piqued my interest.

01:37:05.194 --> 01:37:08.238
- It's a very clever trick, Mr. Ackerman.
- Pleased to meet you.

01:37:08.405 --> 01:37:11.241
Likewise, I'm sure.
Well, let's get on, shall we?

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:17.080
Turn it on, gentlemen.

01:37:21.961 --> 01:37:23.044
Very pretty.

01:37:34.223 --> 01:37:37.642
That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears?

01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:40.645
That's not a trick.
Well, he has to come back.

01:37:40.813 --> 01:37:41.896
There has to be a...

01:37:42.064 --> 01:37:43.481
- A Prestige?
- Exactly.

01:37:46.652 --> 01:37:48.444
Pardon me.

01:37:49.238 --> 01:37:51.656
It's very rare to see...

01:37:52.616 --> 01:37:54.534
...real magic.

01:37:55.327 --> 01:37:58.997
- Yes, it's been many years since I've seen...
- Are you interested in helping us?

01:38:01.208 --> 01:38:02.667
Yes.

01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:05.628
But you'll have to dress it up a little.

01:38:07.256 --> 01:38:08.923
Disguise it.

01:38:10.467 --> 01:38:12.969
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

01:38:13.804 --> 01:38:17.015
You haven't spoken about her, Freddy.
Not once.

01:38:17.182 --> 01:38:20.810
Why would I talk about her to you?

01:38:20.978 --> 01:38:23.354
Because she was a part of your life.

01:38:23.522 --> 01:38:24.689
And now she's gone.

01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:31.905
You know, the day before she killed herself,
she said she wanted to meet me.

01:38:32.197 --> 01:38:35.158
That she had something
to tell me about you.

01:38:35.326 --> 01:38:38.661
I was such a coward,
I couldn't bring myself to face her.

01:38:38.829 --> 01:38:40.496
But...

01:38:41.707 --> 01:38:43.875
...what would she have said?

01:38:44.043 --> 01:38:46.961
You wanna know the truth about me?

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:51.591
Truth is that...

01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:55.011
...I never loved Sarah.

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:57.680
I never loved her.

01:38:57.848 --> 01:39:01.184
- You married her. You had a child with her.
- Yes, yes. Part of me.

01:39:01.352 --> 01:39:05.063
Part of me did, but the other part didn't.

01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:08.566
The part that found you.
The part that's sitting here right now.

01:39:09.693 --> 01:39:10.693
I love you.

01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:14.572
No, Olivia, I love you. That's the truth.

01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:17.158
That is the truth that matters.

01:39:17.326 --> 01:39:21.537
You could be in some other restaurant
with some other woman right now...

01:39:21.705 --> 01:39:23.331
...talking about me that way.

01:39:23.499 --> 01:39:25.500
- No.
- Yes.

01:39:28.879 --> 01:39:33.633
It's inhuman to be so cold.

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:42.600
He's back. After two years.

01:39:42.768 --> 01:39:46.437
He's got a new trick. They're saying
it's the best London's ever seen.

01:39:48.774 --> 01:39:52.193
You should see the look
on your face, Professor.

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:55.029
You should go to him.

01:39:55.197 --> 01:39:57.573
You two deserve each other.

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:06.457
I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet,
they'll be playing through next year.

01:40:06.625 --> 01:40:09.252
Then get rid of them.
There'll be a hundred performances.

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:11.087
No more, no less.

01:40:11.255 --> 01:40:13.715
Five performances a week. No matinees.

01:40:15.592 --> 01:40:18.553
And that's what you'll be charging
for each ticket. Good day.

01:40:41.326 --> 01:40:43.828
Ladies and gentlemen,
my first trick of the evening...

01:40:43.996 --> 01:40:46.664
...is one that involves considerable risk.

01:40:47.124 --> 01:40:49.876
Anyone in the audience
who would be irrevocably damaged...

01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:53.087
...by seeing a man drown
should leave now.

01:40:53.255 --> 01:40:56.215
For when I tell you the young lady
who taught me this illusion...

01:40:56.383 --> 01:40:57.967
...actually died performing it...

01:40:58.135 --> 01:41:01.345
...you will understand the seriousness
of the dangers involved.

01:41:03.599 --> 01:41:05.308
Let's begin.

01:41:15.694 --> 01:41:19.072
In my travels, I have seen the future...

01:41:20.199 --> 01:41:23.034
...and it is a strange future indeed.

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:25.828
The world, ladies and gentlemen...

01:41:25.996 --> 01:41:31.292
...is on the brink of new
and terrifying possibilities.

01:41:50.562 --> 01:41:55.024
What you're about to witness
is not magic.

01:41:55.192 --> 01:41:56.651
It is purely science.

01:41:57.027 --> 01:41:59.445
I would like to invite you
to come up on-stage now...

01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:02.532
...so that you can examine the machine
for yourselves.

01:42:58.005 --> 01:43:01.174
Man's reach exceeds his imagination.

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:02.550
Bravo!

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:08.097
Bravo! Bravo!

01:43:12.561 --> 01:43:15.104
Bravo. Bravo.

01:43:23.363 --> 01:43:25.031
One hundred performances.

01:43:25.199 --> 01:43:27.491
Why? Does his method dictate that?

01:43:27.659 --> 01:43:29.577
Is it a publicity move? What is it?

01:43:29.745 --> 01:43:32.121
He's a no-talent magician,
and they're calling him...

01:43:32.289 --> 01:43:34.415
...the bloody best in England. Why?

01:43:34.625 --> 01:43:37.293
Fifty yards in a second. In a second!

01:43:37.461 --> 01:43:40.421
And all that we know
is he uses a trap door.

01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:44.175
Brilliant. What is going on
under that stage?

01:43:44.968 --> 01:43:47.762
Why can't you outthink him?

01:44:02.486 --> 01:44:03.986
They do this every night?

01:44:04.154 --> 01:44:07.323
After each performance, yeah?

01:44:37.729 --> 01:44:39.355
We're done.

01:44:40.524 --> 01:44:41.941
All right?

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.027
Let him have his trick.

01:44:45.195 --> 01:44:47.613
I don't need... I don't need his secret.

01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:49.365
So...

01:44:50.701 --> 01:44:53.577
...don't go back there,
you leave him alone.

01:44:53.787 --> 01:44:56.956
Both of us, just leave him alone.

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:58.582
We're done.

01:45:07.551 --> 01:45:09.510
I told you, John...

01:45:09.678 --> 01:45:11.595
...I don't want you backstage
on this one.

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:15.891
I would like to invite you
to come up on-stage now...

01:45:16.059 --> 01:45:19.103
...so that you can examine the machine
for yourselves.

01:45:47.591 --> 01:45:51.594
- Hey, you, where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

01:46:00.645 --> 01:46:02.438
Who was that?

01:46:58.995 --> 01:46:59.995
Hey!

01:47:00.163 --> 01:47:03.666
Where's the bloody key?
Where's the bloody key?

01:47:03.875 --> 01:47:06.127
The blind man's got it!

01:47:06.294 --> 01:47:09.839
Where's the bloody key?
Bloody drowning!

01:47:19.224 --> 01:47:21.183
Hold on!

01:47:25.605 --> 01:47:26.856
What have you done?

01:47:48.795 --> 01:47:54.133
Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty
of the murder of Robert Angier.

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:57.928
You will be hanged by the neck
until dead.

01:47:58.722 --> 01:48:01.724
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

01:48:03.351 --> 01:48:05.144
Mr. Cutter?

01:48:05.896 --> 01:48:07.188
Owens.

01:48:07.898 --> 01:48:10.065
Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens.

01:48:10.233 --> 01:48:14.528
It has fallen to me to dispose
of Mr. Angier's equipment.

01:48:14.696 --> 01:48:16.280
But I noticed from this manifest...

01:48:16.448 --> 01:48:19.909
...that Lord Caldlow
has purchased the bulk of the items.

01:48:20.076 --> 01:48:24.038
Mr. Cutter, if you needed to know
where to deliver these items, surely you...

01:48:24.206 --> 01:48:27.500
No, no. It's just
there is one particular item...

01:48:27.667 --> 01:48:31.712
...this item, in fact, that I would like to...

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.881
- You would like to...?
- Buy.

01:48:34.049 --> 01:48:35.966
- Buy yourself?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

01:48:37.219 --> 01:48:39.136
- This is the machine?
- Yes.

01:48:39.304 --> 01:48:43.766
Well, I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant
about purchasing this particular item.

01:48:44.226 --> 01:48:46.936
Do you think I could talk
to Lord Caldlow in person?

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:49.772
Out of the question, I'm afraid.

01:48:52.275 --> 01:48:54.068
Of course...

01:48:54.236 --> 01:48:57.112
...I suppose if, in the course
of your delivery arrangements...

01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:59.740
...your paths were to cross...

01:49:00.158 --> 01:49:04.078
...I can't stop you speaking your mind.
- Thank you.

01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:07.790
- Still here, Borden?
- For now.

01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:09.792
Got a visitor.

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.335
Lord Caldlow.

01:49:11.503 --> 01:49:13.587
With a little girl.

01:49:22.097 --> 01:49:23.681
Jess?

01:49:23.848 --> 01:49:25.349
Hello, my love.

01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:28.936
How are you? I've missed you so much.

01:49:29.104 --> 01:49:31.146
And Fallon's missed you too.
We both have.

01:49:31.314 --> 01:49:33.524
Daddy, can I come in there?

01:49:34.317 --> 01:49:36.652
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:40.364
No, but everything is gonna be all right.

01:49:40.824 --> 01:49:43.492
- You must be Lord Caldlow.
- Caldlow.

01:49:43.827 --> 01:49:44.952
Yes, I am.

01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:46.287
I always have been.

01:49:51.334 --> 01:49:53.502
They flatter you
with all those chains, Alfred.

01:49:53.670 --> 01:49:56.630
Don't they know you can't escape
without your little rubber ball?

01:49:56.798 --> 01:49:57.923
I pulled you out.

01:49:58.091 --> 01:49:59.633
Out of that tank.

01:49:59.801 --> 01:50:03.470
All I wanted to do was prove
that I was a better magician...

01:50:03.638 --> 01:50:05.514
...but you couldn't leave me alone.

01:50:07.183 --> 01:50:09.351
I don't know what you've done...

01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:14.732
...but you're not afraid
to get your hands dirty anymore, are you?

01:50:14.899 --> 01:50:16.734
No, not anymore.

01:50:16.901 --> 01:50:18.152
And I win.

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:21.530
Because no one cares about the man
in the box, the man who disappears.

01:50:21.698 --> 01:50:22.698
You win?

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:28.621
This ain't a bloody competition anymore,
Angier, this is my little girl's life.

01:50:28.788 --> 01:50:31.874
And don't you dare put her
in the middle of this.

01:50:32.042 --> 01:50:34.877
Oh, I know how hard it is
to have someone so special...

01:50:35.045 --> 01:50:37.671
...taken away from me, don't I, Borden?

01:50:38.506 --> 01:50:41.133
And you can't take her with you now,
can you?

01:50:41.301 --> 01:50:43.052
Oh, she'll be looked after.

01:50:43.595 --> 01:50:47.723
- Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling.
- No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Look.

01:50:47.891 --> 01:50:49.224
Here.

01:50:50.685 --> 01:50:52.394
That's what you're after.

01:50:52.562 --> 01:50:54.688
That's what this is about.

01:50:54.856 --> 01:50:56.106
Take it.

01:50:56.274 --> 01:50:58.233
- Your secret?
- Yeah.

01:51:01.237 --> 01:51:03.614
You always were the better magician.

01:51:03.782 --> 01:51:05.282
We both know that.

01:51:05.450 --> 01:51:09.161
But whatever your secret was,
I mean, you have to agree...

01:51:09.412 --> 01:51:10.412
...mine is better.

01:51:12.332 --> 01:51:15.542
Don't do this. Don't do this, Angier, no.
Jess, Jess, Jess.

01:51:15.919 --> 01:51:19.088
Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon.
I promise.

01:51:19.464 --> 01:51:21.757
- For God's sake, Borden.
- I promise. Look.

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:27.096
I promise.

01:51:27.263 --> 01:51:30.933
- I love you, Jess. I love you.
- Come on.

01:51:31.101 --> 01:51:34.269
- Come on. Come on.
- I love you. I love you, Jess.

01:51:34.437 --> 01:51:36.772
Angier. Angier!

01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:38.941
What, you think this place can hold me?

01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:41.985
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

01:51:42.153 --> 01:51:45.280
They're gonna bloody hang me!
You can put a stop to this now!

01:51:45.448 --> 01:51:47.533
- Listen! Listen! That man...!
- Just shut up.

01:51:47.701 --> 01:51:50.119
Listen, that man is the one
I'm meant to have killed!

01:51:50.286 --> 01:51:52.246
You blind bastard, listen to me!

01:51:52.414 --> 01:51:54.331
- If he's alive, I'm not guilty!
- Guards!

01:51:54.499 --> 01:51:56.667
- I'm not guilty!
- I don't care! Get hold of him!

01:51:56.835 --> 01:51:58.836
- Goodbye, Professor.
- Angier!

01:52:03.591 --> 01:52:05.300
Run along now.

01:52:06.261 --> 01:52:09.763
Sir. There's a gentleman waiting.

01:52:25.613 --> 01:52:26.655
Dear God.

01:52:27.449 --> 01:52:29.116
Hello, Cutter.

01:52:29.701 --> 01:52:31.618
You're... You're still alive.

01:52:31.786 --> 01:52:33.537
How is it you're still alive, Robert?

01:52:33.788 --> 01:52:36.081
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

01:52:39.335 --> 01:52:41.128
- Child.
- Good night, sir.

01:52:41.296 --> 01:52:42.796
Good night, Jess.

01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:46.091
I've seen her before.

01:52:46.259 --> 01:52:51.555
I saw her in court with Fallon.

01:52:53.433 --> 01:52:55.934
- What have you done?
- Well, she needs looking after.

01:52:56.102 --> 01:52:58.353
She needs her father.

01:52:58.772 --> 01:53:01.523
You're letting him hang,
and I helped you.

01:53:01.691 --> 01:53:07.571
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow
to let me destroy that machine.

01:53:08.114 --> 01:53:11.366
I am not gonna beg you for anything.

01:53:11.534 --> 01:53:14.787
You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure
that machine's never used again.

01:53:15.955 --> 01:53:20.209
Then, Lord Caldlow...

01:53:21.711 --> 01:53:23.629
...where do you want me to deliver it?

01:53:23.797 --> 01:53:25.172
My theater.

01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:27.466
It belongs with the Prestige materials.

01:53:28.092 --> 01:53:30.594
John, I tried not to involve you.

01:53:43.566 --> 01:53:45.442
So...

01:53:47.779 --> 01:53:49.863
...we go alone now.

01:53:50.532 --> 01:53:52.407
Both of us.

01:53:55.829 --> 01:53:59.248
Only I don't have as far to go as you.

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:06.171
No.

01:54:07.298 --> 01:54:10.676
You were right, I should have left him
to his damn trick.

01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:13.971
I'm sorry.

01:54:15.765 --> 01:54:18.141
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

01:54:19.269 --> 01:54:21.436
I'm sorry about Sarah.

01:54:23.106 --> 01:54:24.815
I didn't mean to hurt her.

01:54:24.983 --> 01:54:26.942
I didn't.

01:54:28.486 --> 01:54:31.196
You go live your life in full now, all right?

01:54:31.364 --> 01:54:32.906
You live for both of us.

01:54:41.624 --> 01:54:43.166
Goodbye.

01:55:29.464 --> 01:55:31.256
Are you watching closely?

01:56:02.705 --> 01:56:04.706
Put it down the end.

01:56:38.282 --> 01:56:42.452
Take a minute to consider
your achievement.

01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:48.000
I once told you about a sailor
who described drowning to me.

01:56:48.167 --> 01:56:50.252
Yes, he said it was like going home.

01:56:51.295 --> 01:56:56.216
I was lying. He said it was agony.

01:57:34.964 --> 01:57:36.923
Alfred Borden...

01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:41.053
...this day, in the name of the king
and the High Court of England...

01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:43.472
...you will meet your end.

01:57:45.141 --> 01:57:48.060
No one cares about the man in the box.

01:57:52.148 --> 01:58:00.072
Cutter?

01:58:01.866 --> 01:58:05.285
Do you have anything to say?

01:58:08.831 --> 01:58:10.290
Abracadabra.

01:58:46.911 --> 01:58:48.662
A brother.

01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:50.163
A twin.

01:58:51.332 --> 01:58:56.628
You were Fallon the whole time.

01:58:56.796 --> 01:58:57.921
No.

01:58:58.923 --> 01:59:01.299
We were both Fallon.

01:59:01.467 --> 01:59:02.551
And we were both Borden.

01:59:08.724 --> 01:59:11.643
Were you...? Were you the one
who went into the box...

01:59:11.811 --> 01:59:13.603
...or the one who came back out?

01:59:14.897 --> 01:59:16.982
We took turns.

01:59:21.863 --> 01:59:23.864
The trick is where we would swap.

01:59:30.163 --> 01:59:34.624
Cutter knew. Cutter knew.
But I told him it was too simple, too easy.

01:59:35.793 --> 01:59:37.419
No.

01:59:38.171 --> 01:59:40.046
Simple maybe, but not easy.

01:59:40.423 --> 01:59:43.967
There's nothing easy
about two men sharing one life.

01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:51.808
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

01:59:56.814 --> 01:59:58.982
What about Olivia? And your wife?

01:59:59.942 --> 02:00:01.902
We each loved one of them.

02:00:05.615 --> 02:00:07.616
I loVed Sarah.

02:00:08.659 --> 02:00:10.911
He loVed OliVia.

02:00:11.370 --> 02:00:16.499
We each had half of a full life, really,
which was enough for us.

02:00:16.667 --> 02:00:18.460
Just.

02:00:20.213 --> 02:00:22.047
But not for them.

02:00:24.675 --> 02:00:29.387
See, sacrifice, Robert,
that's the price of a good trick.

02:00:31.891 --> 02:00:34.643
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

02:00:38.147 --> 02:00:39.439
I've made sacrifices.

02:00:39.607 --> 02:00:41.358
- No.
- Yes.

02:00:41.984 --> 02:00:44.945
It takes nothing
to steal another man's work.

02:00:46.155 --> 02:00:47.739
It takes everything.

02:01:07.843 --> 02:01:10.845
No. No.
No, wait! I'm the...!

02:01:17.019 --> 02:01:19.145
It took courage.

02:01:21.357 --> 02:01:24.484
It took courage to climb
into that machine every night...

02:01:25.319 --> 02:01:30.282
...not knowing
if I'd be the man in the box...

02:01:33.202 --> 02:01:34.202
...or in the Prestige.

02:01:36.038 --> 02:01:40.667
Do you wanna...?
Do you wanna see what it cost me?

02:01:41.127 --> 02:01:44.254
You didn't see where you are, did you?

02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:47.048
Look. Look.

02:01:48.092 --> 02:01:50.176
I don't care.

02:01:54.473 --> 02:01:57.100
You went halfway around the world.

02:01:58.102 --> 02:02:01.062
You spent a fortune.

02:02:02.898 --> 02:02:05.233
You did terrible things.

02:02:06.402 --> 02:02:09.237
Really terrible things, Robert.

02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:12.407
And all for nothing.

02:02:13.659 --> 02:02:16.369
- For nothing?
- Yeah.

02:02:19.749 --> 02:02:24.502
You never understood why we did this.

02:02:27.423 --> 02:02:30.675
The audience knows the truth.

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:35.263
The world is simple. It's miserable.

02:02:37.058 --> 02:02:39.559
Solid all the way through.

02:02:41.479 --> 02:02:46.066
But if you could fool them,
even for a second...

02:02:47.610 --> 02:02:50.320
...then you could make them wonder.

02:02:51.155 --> 02:02:52.989
And then you...

02:02:53.449 --> 02:02:57.911
Then you got to see something
very special.

02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:04.042
You really don't know?

02:03:07.713 --> 02:03:13.009
It was... It was the look on their faces.

02:03:28.192 --> 02:03:33.196
Every magic trick consists
of three parts or acts.

02:03:36.492 --> 02:03:39.702
The first part is called the Pledge.

02:03:40.121 --> 02:03:42.789
The magician shows you
something ordinary.

02:03:43.958 --> 02:03:47.669
The second act is called the Turn.

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:51.005
The magician takes
the ordinary something...

02:03:51.173 --> 02:03:54.134
...and makes it into
something extraordinary.

02:03:55.428 --> 02:03:57.178
But you wouldn't clap yet...

02:03:57.346 --> 02:04:00.432
...because making something disappear
isn't enough.

02:04:01.058 --> 02:04:04.561
You have to bring it back.

02:04:08.315 --> 02:04:09.983
Hey.

02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:41.055
Now you're looking for the secret.

02:04:43.309 --> 02:04:48.229
But you won't find it because,
of course, you're not really looking.

02:04:50.232 --> 02:04:53.318
You don't really want to work it out.

02:04:56.405 --> 02:04:58.698
You want to be fooled.

02:10:22.397 --> 02:10:24.398
