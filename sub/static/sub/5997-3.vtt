00:55.320 --> 00:56.833
(NECK BREAKING)

01:21.000 --> 01:22.399
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

02:02.360 --> 02:04.192
My husband wants to
thank you for comin'.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.315
MICKEY: Course.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.789
We know which side
of the bread gets buttered.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.550
We know how
to butter bread.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.199
You don't have to yell.
He's not deaf.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.709
[... I didn't...

02:17.880 --> 02:19.678
What's wrong
with him, then?

02:19.760 --> 02:21.637
He had a stroke.
A mild stroke.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.199
He can't walk or talk.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.873
For now he can't.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.712
One day, though.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.710
He's still

02:29.800 --> 02:32.394
the same lion inside.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.993
But until he's better,
you talk to me.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.479
BEAR: That's right.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.550
Talk to Ma.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.156
She's in charge.

02:40.240 --> 02:44.791
Also, we wanna thank you
for your cards and letters.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.234
Are you kiddin' me?
Cards and letters?

02:46.320 --> 02:48.072
We're in a state of siege
and you're talkin' about cards...

02:48.160 --> 02:49.230
Boys.

02:50.680 --> 02:51.909
You know about
the offer on the table?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.991
Kansas City?

02:54.080 --> 02:56.435
The money's good, you know.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.590
More than fair.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.513
Sure, but what they don't
tell ya is, after ya sign,

03:00.600 --> 03:02.079
they take your balls
with a straight razor,

03:02.200 --> 03:03.554
and fatten ya up
like a house cat.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.119
Language!
Gimme a break.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.591
I'm sayin',
this is our business.

03:08.680 --> 03:12.878
We built it with blood
and muscle. It's earned.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.280
And ya can't just
write a check...

03:14.360 --> 03:15.430
FLOYD: This family has been...

03:15.520 --> 03:16.715
Ya can't just write a check!

03:16.840 --> 03:19.514
FLOYD: This family has been a
peacetime family since Kennedy.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.355
You think we
just out of the blue

03:21.440 --> 03:22.874
pick up our guns
and it's High Noon?

03:25.960 --> 03:28.793
We're talkin' about
the Kansas City mafia.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.760
They're like all
the sharks in the sea.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.832
And we're...
Let's be honest.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.558
We're small-time.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.519
Know thyself.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.717
What are you on about?

03:45.280 --> 03:46.918
It's in the Bible.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.315
I'm sayin' we hit
'em and hit 'em hard.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.153
Otherwise, wither and die.
Right, Pop?

03:58.360 --> 04:01.830
Look, it's not just the
business. It's the country.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.877
This no-brains Jimmy Carter
with his stupid peanut grin.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.110
And now I gotta wait in line
to fill my tank?

04:08.200 --> 04:09.793
DODD: Exactly.
Where does it end?

04:09.880 --> 04:12.110
Enough. All of you.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.634
It may be we have to fight.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.836
And I'm not afraid of a war.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.793
I'm not.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.349
But on my terms,

04:26.440 --> 04:28.272
as a last resort.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.716
So I need to know now,

04:32.800 --> 04:34.120
are you with me?

04:38.640 --> 04:40.597
Well, look.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.591
We talked,

04:42.680 --> 04:44.717
and we're not sayin',
"Yes, we're goin' to war."

04:46.320 --> 04:50.279
But we recognize promises
were made in blood.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.953
Generations ago.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.030
Hmm.

04:54.040 --> 04:58.432
What he's sayin'is, we're
not gonna make the first move.

05:00.040 --> 05:05.114
But if these Kansas City mooks
come at ya shootin',

05:05.240 --> 05:08.756
we'll cut the goddamn
nose off their face.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.794
Mmm-hmm.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.113
Late.
MIKE: Sorry.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.511
Couldn't get the shampoo
out of my hair.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.193
It's soft water.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.389
Say what?

05:38.480 --> 05:41.438
This goddamn northern water.
It's slick to the touch.

05:41.520 --> 05:44.114
Yeah, I thought it
was the shampoo.

05:44.200 --> 05:48.194
Could be that, too.
I always carry my own. Agree.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.395
Agree to what?

05:53.760 --> 05:55.831
That's the brand. Agree.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.709
No additives.
It works, hard water or soft.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.313
Feel my hair.

06:02.840 --> 06:06.356
Yeah, that's nice.

06:06.440 --> 06:10.559
So update's this. Nothin' on
the Gerhardt Frau as to yes or no.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.990
I didn't expect it,
but still.

06:13.080 --> 06:16.038
Research thinks that
they'll stall, then pass.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.229
So we kill 'em.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.839
Maybe.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.638
If the market says
kill 'em, we Kill 'em.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.394
If the market says offer more
money, we offer more money.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.199
Whatever the pluses
and minuses dictate.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.319
And on the Gerhardt kid,
this Rye?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.914
Get this.
He gunned down a judge,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.753
some small hick town a
couple hours south from here,

06:42.880 --> 06:44.279
then disappeared.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.234
On the run now,
we're thinkin'.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.551
On the run is good.
On the run, we can use.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.752
Find him.
You, not them.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.160
Then he's leverage
over the Frau,

06:56.240 --> 07:00.552
and maybe turn things our way
without buyin' a bunch of extra bullets.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.997
DISPATCHER:
Car 18. Over.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.351
This is 18. Over.

07:22.440 --> 07:26.149
I got the Rock County
sheriff on the line. Hold. Over.

07:27.600 --> 07:31.036
HANK: Went by the house.
Betsy says you're up in Fargo.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.714
Yeah. Went to see about
our judge's caseload.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.474
Maybe there's a connection
with our shooter. Over.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.760
Well, I'm calling 'cause
we got a print match

07:39.840 --> 07:41.035
off of that gun you found.

07:41.880 --> 07:45.669
Right index belonged
to one Rye Gerhardt,

07:45.760 --> 07:49.355
which, I looked up,
is the youngest male heir

07:49.440 --> 07:52.114
to that Gerhardt
syndicate out of Fargo.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.960
Ya don't say. Over.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.554
HANK: Yup. So there's that.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.313
Okay, well, I'll mention
that to Fargo PD.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.153
Probably be back
late tonight, though.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.959
You wanna tell Betsy
not to wait up for me? Over.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.235
Okay, then.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.713
Sounds good. Over.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.916
Over and out, I guess.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.272
How ya doin'?

08:35.360 --> 08:36.873
Ya know. Waitin'.

08:37.679 --> 08:40.193
Lou Solverson,
Minnesota State Police.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.395
Drove up from Luverne.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.757
Ben Schmidt.
Forensics' inside.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.230
Takin' their time.
(CHUCKLES)

08:51.320 --> 08:52.640
Yeah.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.835
(CLEARS THROAT)

08:59.080 --> 09:01.435
Heard the crime
Mmm. scene was a deal.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.275
I'm workin' things
up here.

09:05.360 --> 09:10.116
Thought, maybe tomorrow,
drive down, take a look.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.115
You're welcome to.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.993
Or I can send ya the photos.
They're pretty thorough.

09:16.080 --> 09:20.392
Three dead, including the judge.
Fry cook and a waitress also.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.959
Shot multiple times.

09:23.360 --> 09:26.193
Got the prints back
on the gun just before.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.714
Rye Gerhardt?

09:31.480 --> 09:32.550
That bad, huh?

09:35.760 --> 09:37.239
I'm not sayin' your
life would be easier

09:37.320 --> 09:38.754
if it was your own
prints on the gun,

09:38.840 --> 09:40.478
but that's the lines along
which you should be thinkin'.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.232
Distribution, right?
Gerhardts?

09:46.320 --> 09:47.355
Yeah.

09:48.320 --> 09:52.439
Dieter, that's Otto's dad, started
runnin' booze during Prohibition,

09:52.520 --> 09:54.431
ended up buildin'
a truckin' empire.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.191
1951, he gets 19
bullets in the head.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.476
That's when the son,
Otto, he takes over,

10:00.560 --> 10:05.191
which is like, the good
news is, World War I is over.

10:05.280 --> 10:08.796
The bad news is,
say hello to Adolf Hitler.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.196
And the shooter
is Otto's youngest?

10:11.320 --> 10:14.073
Yeah. Yeah, the runt.

10:14.160 --> 10:18.199
Basically wind and swagger. Except,
I guess he's more than that now.

10:18.680 --> 10:19.670
Say...

10:21.640 --> 10:27.352
You ever heard of a Mike
Milligan or the Kitchen Brothers?

10:27.920 --> 10:29.672
Out of Kansas City.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.318
Caught 'em sniffin' around
the crime scene.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.471
But nothin' to
hold 'em on, so...

10:40.640 --> 10:42.836
You, uh...
You in the service?

10:44.120 --> 10:47.556
Navy. Two tours. Swift Boat.
I was a lieutenant.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.351
Infantry for me,
outside Da Nang.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.399
And we had a sayin'. Fubar.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.551
Yeah, we had that, too.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.551
So when you put a dead judge,
the Gerhardt family,

11:06.640 --> 11:10.429
and some hitters from
Kansas City in a bag together,

11:10.520 --> 11:12.113
I go back to thinkin'
it might be best

11:12.200 --> 11:14.032
just to confess to
the crime myself,

11:14.120 --> 11:15.758
go live a long life
in a cell somewhere

11:15.840 --> 11:17.592
with hot and
cold runnin' water.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.390
(SIGHS)

11:34.360 --> 11:35.759
HANZEE: He got a place
in town, then, your uncle?

11:35.880 --> 11:36.870
SIMONE: Rye?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.236
Something he
doesn't tell people.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.515
Where he can
do his business?

11:40.600 --> 11:41.954
You mean
nail girls?

11:42.040 --> 11:43.633
Girls, drugs.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.633
I don't know.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.079
I don't.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.270
I mean, maybe.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.709
Okay, maybe I've been there.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.678
With a boy or to
score some weed.

12:03.760 --> 12:07.435
No drugs, your dad says. Says
anyone sells to you gets the ax.

12:07.520 --> 12:10.831
Jeez. You're all
a bunch of squares.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.680
Sometimes, a girl just wants
to bust a nut, you know?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.874
It's over on 13th somewhere.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.909
Near the train station,
I think.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.514
Not like I memorized
the address.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.035
Show me.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.552
MAN: (SINGING) If you know

12:51.720 --> 12:55.190
If you know someone

12:55.600 --> 12:58.831
who's been looking

12:59.200 --> 13:01.669
for true love

13:02.520 --> 13:04.591
Send her to me

13:04.720 --> 13:08.873
Oh, yeah
Send her to me

13:09.360 --> 13:11.920
I'm looking too

13:12.120 --> 13:16.034
BETSY: It's supposed to fall
out, they say. With the chemo.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.916
Donna Pearlman
lost hers overnight.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.278
Woke up, thought there was
a dog sleepin' on her pillow.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.078
(SCOFFS)
Not everyone loses it.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.919
We could just
wait and see.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.834
Part of me thinks I should
just shave it off. Be bald.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.918
My cousin had a melanoma.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.231
Didn't lose a single hair.
Lost her eyebrows though.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.552
Now that'd be a horror show.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.796
So, I decided.
I wanna do it.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.351
What's that, hon?
The seminar.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.831
I thought about it,
and I think I should.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.311
I'm so happy!
So happy!

13:57.440 --> 13:58.555
What seminar?

13:58.640 --> 14:02.952
It's called Lifespring.
Did it last year in Mankato?

14:03.040 --> 14:04.394
Amazing.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.470
Oh.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.509
Yeah, and I just... You know, I wanna
be the best me I can be, ya know?

14:09.600 --> 14:11.318
CONSTANCE: Good for you.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.431
What did Ed say
when you asked him?

14:16.280 --> 14:18.032
You didn't, did ya?

14:18.120 --> 14:19.679
(LAUGHS)

14:19.760 --> 14:21.433
You naughty girl.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.999
We were busy.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.550
Ladies.

14:26.640 --> 14:27.869
Hi, Dad.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.792
Spoke to your man
on the wireless.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.712
Said to say he's
gonna be late tonight.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.076
Yeah, I thought he might.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.195
Whatcha got there?

14:35.280 --> 14:38.033
HANK: Connie, ya mind if I put
one of those up in your window?

14:38.120 --> 14:39.110
CONSTANCE: No.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.039
Okay, Mrs. Blaycock.
You can head to the dryer.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.112
Is that him? The one
killed those poor people?

14:47.240 --> 14:49.709
We think so. Yeah.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.473
City boy, turns out.

14:51.560 --> 14:56.270
Rye Gerhardt. Raised without
the proper moral fiber, I'm thinkin'.

14:56.360 --> 14:59.000
I mean, to kill
all those people.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.117
And for what?
You know, a little money?

15:01.200 --> 15:03.430
You know,
I was thinkin' last night.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.312

the shooter left his vehicle behind?

walked out onto the road

hit by a car?

a dead judge.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.598

it falls to us.

We're gonna have
to talk to Rye.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.671
That's not gonna happen.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.239
You need to leave.

31:13.520 --> 31:17.195
Mrs. Gerhardt, if either
of these men draw,

31:17.280 --> 31:20.033
I'm gonna be forced to shoot some
people and I don't wanna do that.

31:21.080 --> 31:24.038
Now, your son's wanted in
connection with three murders.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.509
And I'm guessing that's not the first
time you heard somebody say that.

31:26.600 --> 31:29.672
So however it is you wanna handle
this, you need to handle it now.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.478
Or it'll get
handled for ya.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.233

You're gonna find my boot on
your neck, you keep talkin' like that.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.509

I'm the one who found the gun.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.796

with the wrong girl.

32:06.720 --> 32:07.710

32:09.320 --> 32:11.675
I says, I'm the one
who found the gun.

32:11.760 --> 32:12.955
So you should
be talkin' to me.
