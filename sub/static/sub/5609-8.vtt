NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.712 --> 00:05.919
MERLIN: Emma, there is a way
to make Excalibur Whole again.

00:06.006 --> 00:09.669
A spark. From mankind's original ﬁre,
the flame of Prometheus.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.875
lts heat forged Excalibur.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.381
You know I'm a survivor.
This ring is why.

00:13.472 --> 00:14.678
Be careful, Emma.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.847
Quite an ingenious recipe
for a tethering potion.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.391
It can control
the world's greatest Wizard.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.514
Merlin! How kind of you
to come when called.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.061
You lied to him. To David.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.183
ARTH U R: And it brought me
no pleasure.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.731
He's a good man.
But I must think of my kingdom first.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.868
DAVID: That's Arthur's tent.

00:43.794 --> 00:46.957
-|'|| go in first. You two stand guard.
-(COCKS GUN)

00:47.005 --> 00:49.121
And if our dishonest king
should put up a fight?

00:49.216 --> 00:51.332
I'll make him wish he hadn't.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.343
DAVID: Arthur.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.012
David. Good to see you, my friend.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.645
Come, sit, join us.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.469
Why don't you explain
why you lied to me?

01:06.149 --> 01:07.400
Why you tried to burn
the Crimson Crown.

01:10.654 --> 01:13.145
-So you found me out.
-Yeah, I found out.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.355
Fnend.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.482
No, that part was real.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.862
Nah, it doesn't matter.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.076
Not anymore.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.864
(SIGHS) But I want answers.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.662
See, there was a message in there
from Merlin.

01:25.752 --> 01:29.165
He said there is only one person
who could destroy the Dark One,

01:29.214 --> 01:30.374
named Nimue.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.842
You tell me who that is.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.390

(PANTING)

02:14.259 --> 02:15.795
ARTHUR: Look at that.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.544
It seems you've brought a hook
to a sword fight.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.554
Actually, I brought a sword.
But I seem to have misplaced it.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.589
ARTH U R: Shame.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.634
It's always the simple mistakes
that get us killed.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.553
(GRUNTS)

02:35.238 --> 02:37.695
Excalibur. (BREATHING SHALLOWLY)

02:38.075 --> 02:39.360
It's whole.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.742
Yes, it is.
But it's not going to help you.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.659
This sword doesn't control anyone now.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.281
Aah!

02:48.460 --> 02:49.575
(GRUNTS)

02:51.713 --> 02:53.419
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
I suppose I should say thank you.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.506
You don't need to say anything.
Just don't do that again.

02:57.260 --> 03:00.673
I should apologize for what I said
that day aboard my ship.

03:00.764 --> 03:04.006
For when you refused to accept me,
or when you said you did not love me?

03:04.101 --> 03:06.262
It's a bit more complicated than that.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.928
Doesn't matter. I'm the Dark One.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.558
You're more than the Dark One.
You're still you.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.102
You saved me. That was Emma.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.600
What do you want from me?

03:15.737 --> 03:17.728
I wanna help you.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.022
And I need your help to do it.
Who is Nimue?

03:20.117 --> 03:22.073
And how could she
defeat the darkness?

03:22.119 --> 03:24.906
Nimue doesn't matter anymore.
This will all be over tomorrow.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.412
What will be over?
And why do you need that damn sword?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.784
Ah, all this power,

03:31.878 --> 03:34.915
and you don't even have the courage
to answer one simple bloody question.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.626
Why do you need Excalibur?

03:39.136 --> 03:40.876
I know you're still in there, Emma.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.132
And I know that despite everything,
you always have your reasons!

03:43.265 --> 03:44.926
You're right, I do!

03:44.975 --> 03:47.887
You want to know
why I'm doing all of this?

03:53.275 --> 03:54.981
I'm doing it for you.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.957
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

04:34.608 --> 04:36.849
Mom, did you do it?
Did you find the spark of...

04:36.985 --> 04:38.771
Prometheus. Yes.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.523
Now I can use it to fix Excalibur.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.691
-Finally some good news.
-That's great, Mom.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.655
Let's get that darkness out of you.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.612
Yes, let's. Where's the sword?

04:46.703 --> 04:48.864
I don't know.
No one's come back with it.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.207
Really? They should've
been back hours ago.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.701
Have you seen Merlin?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.283
I thought he was with you.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.868
He was, but then he vanished.
Something's wrong.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.211
I don't think we're safe here anymore.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.296
Granny, let's close up shop.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.466
One step ahead of you.
Henry, lock the front. I got the back.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.307
Henry?

05:14.022 --> 05:15.523
MERLIN: He'll be fine.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.226
Once we're done.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.062
I'm sorry for the theatrics.

05:20.195 --> 05:24.404
It's not usually my style,
but I had to follow orders.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.573
-Orders? Whose orders?
-Arthur's.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.908
My wayward pupil has done something
I did not foresee.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.659
He's tethered me to Excalibur.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.913
Arthur has ordered me
to reforge Excalibur into a whole sword,

05:37.003 --> 05:39.585
which means I will need your dagger
and the Promethean flame.

05:39.714 --> 05:40.749
No.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.547
Then he will order me to kill your family.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.584
And, Emma, as much as I hate it,
I will obey.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.927
-Arthur has my family?
-MERL|N: Yes.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.221
Because of me. I'm sorry.

05:50.267 --> 05:54.010
He wants to make a trade, in the heart
of the Caledonian Forest in one hour.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.267
Their lives for the dagger and the flame.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.765
That's not enough time.
This isn't even a flame yet.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.108
I've seen the strength in you, Emma.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.358
When you're ready to light the spark,
it will burn.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.439
And Arthur will have what he wants.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.692
The sword will be whole once again.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.277
So I'm just supposed to give up
without a fight?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.613
Acceptance is a form of strength.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.286
I know the darkness lives in you, Emma.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.210
But I beg you, please.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.295
Do not seek vengeance.

06:23.425 --> 06:27.043
Do not make the same
mistakes as Nimue.

06:30.307 --> 06:33.140
Who's Nimue? What the hell
happened back in Camelot?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.466
I wish I knew.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.811
That blonde demon took my memories,
same as yours.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.934
Then why destroy Merlin's message?

06:39.983 --> 06:41.644
What aren't you bloody telling us?

06:41.776 --> 06:44.153
That's enough!
He doesn't know anything.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.317
He's a king with no kingdom,

06:45.405 --> 06:48.818
and as much as he hates it,
he's not important anymore.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.492
Feel any better?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.990
KILLIAN: I'll feel better
when I have some answers.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.409
Emma said
this whole thing was about me.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.286
REGINA: (CHUCKLES)
Are you really that naive?

06:59.836 --> 07:02.452
She's manipulating you.
That's what the Dark One does.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.497
No. This was Emma talking.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.629
There may not be any Emma.
Not anymore.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.838
She's right.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.838
This Dark One,

07:12.933 --> 07:17.267
she has Excalibur, and she is
going to destroy all light magic.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.015
So that's what you think it's about?

07:19.105 --> 07:20.936
A sword she hasn't actually used.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.686
Well, obviously, she needs
another ingredient to cast the spell.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.853
So we figure out what that is
and stop her from getting it.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.863
Then we get our Emma back.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.199
You can all look at magic spells
till you're blue in the face.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.368
But something happened
between me and her in Camelot.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.322
The only way to help Emma
is to find out what the hell it was.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.251

07:51.346 --> 07:53.712

07:54.557 --> 07:58.015
Didn't you hear?
I'm not that man anymore.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.561
Belle, you can, uh...

08:03.191 --> 08:05.978
Yeah. Sorry, I thought
you might be Emma.

08:06.069 --> 08:09.186
It's a good thing I'm not.
A crossbow wouldn't do you much good.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.525
Well, best we could manage.

08:11.574 --> 08:15.362
I did have some squid ink
set aside for a rainy day.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.573
But, uh, unfortunately,

08:19.249 --> 08:20.910
she found it.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.242
Dark Ones are clever like that.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.169
Clever enough to make everyone
believe that they've really changed.

08:28.425 --> 08:32.088
I need to know what's going on
inside Emma's head now.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.506
She said she's doing all this
because of me.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.430
This isn't about what you did.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.049
It's about what she did.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.558
You're sure of that?

08:40.603 --> 08:43.436
I've seen the look on her face,

along the way.

08:54.075 --> 08:58.284
Convinced myself I would atone
for them all once I'd found him.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.621
But things never work out
the way you think they will.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.200
If you wanna know
what Emma Swan is after,

09:05.295 --> 09:07.536
find out what she's atoning for.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.793
And how do I do that?
I've been looking all over for her.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.294
She doesn't want to be found.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.964
Then you have to give her
a reason to find you.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.244
He can ask me to move in.

(BREATHING SHALLOWLY)

12:27.413 --> 12:29.449
(GRUNTS) Something's wrong.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.916
Something's wrong!

12:31.167 --> 12:32.373
(GRUNTS)

12:32.460 --> 12:34.325
Help! I need help!

12:34.462 --> 12:37.545
Aah! Somebody help me! (CRIES)

12:37.674 --> 12:38.834
(GRUNTS)

12:38.883 --> 12:40.214
Let me out!

12:41.010 --> 12:42.386
What's wrong? What happened?

12:42.470 --> 12:45.928
A bit difficult to explain.
You better see for yourselves.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.926
Careful, could be
another one of her tricks.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.517
(GRUNTS)

12:51.604 --> 12:53.344
(BREATHING SHALLOWLY)

12:54.983 --> 12:56.848
Well, don'tjust stare. Help me!

12:56.943 --> 12:58.729
How... How has this happened?

12:58.820 --> 13:00.356
You're only two months pregnant.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.606
Well, how do you think?

13:01.698 --> 13:03.154
Dark magic.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.234
Aah!

13:04.325 --> 13:06.236
Whose dark magic?

13:07.203 --> 13:09.364
Emma Swan!

13:11.958 --> 13:13.949
Emma Swan!

13:18.756 --> 13:21.042
Emma Swan!

13:26.139 --> 13:28.596
I guess I'll have to do this the hard way.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.435
You were sure I'd save you?

13:35.523 --> 13:39.266
I'm either optimistic
or desperate or both.

13:40.445 --> 13:43.733
I need to know what happened
between us in Camelot. Just tell me.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.193
-It's not that easy.
-It can be.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.615
Whatever you did,

13:47.702 --> 13:49.567
whatever you're trying to atone for,

13:49.662 --> 13:50.947
I already forgive you.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.654
I don't need forgiveness.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.990
Then come clean.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.291
I assure you,
you've done no worse than I.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.619
I was a pirate for hundreds of years.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.250
And you think it's the same?

14:02.300 --> 14:03.836
You see this?

14:04.385 --> 14:06.376
Belonged to a man named Barnaby.

14:06.471 --> 14:07.756
He called me One Hand Jones,

14:07.847 --> 14:10.179
I killed him in front of his wife,
took his ring.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.881
This one? Edgar.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.352
Fine sailor.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.269
I caught him drinking
the captain's wine. I drowned him.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.894
Every ring is a sad story.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.269
What about this one?

14:24.947 --> 14:26.653
You have it.
I thought I lost it in Camelot.

14:27.450 --> 14:30.157
You gave it to me to keep it safe.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.578
It's the saddest story of all.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.872
It belonged to a better man than I.
My brother, Liam.

14:38.086 --> 14:40.168
-You can have it back now.
-Keep it.

14:40.254 --> 14:44.042
You know,
I used to wear these rings as trophies.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.927
But all that changed when I met you.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.011
-What are they now?
-A reminder,

14:51.099 --> 14:54.637
that all sins can be forgiven
when someone loves you.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.426
And I was absolutely wrong before.

14:57.522 --> 15:00.980
I love you, Emma Swan.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.353
No matter what you've done.

15:04.112 --> 15:07.195
So you really wanna know the truth,
no matter how awful?

15:07.281 --> 15:08.566
I do.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.317
Then there's something
I need to show you.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.961
I've already seen your home, Swan.
Why're we here?

15:24.048 --> 15:26.004
You promised me the truth,
not a bloody tour.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.253
The truth is tricky.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.505
You have to look for it.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.718
(SIGHS)

15:31.806 --> 15:35.344
All right. I'll play your game.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.474
Oh.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.193
I guess being the Dark One
has its perks.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.116
That is a stunning view of the sea.

15:54.203 --> 15:58.071
There's no sight
like a full moon on the waves.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.078
Back in Camelot,
you said the ocean calmed you.

16:01.169 --> 16:02.705
I thought you might like to see it.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.292
You've picked yourself a fine home.
I give you that.

16:07.383 --> 16:10.341
I didn't pick it. You did.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.342
That's my handwriting.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.678
You said this was our future together.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.815
Everything I've done
has been to keep that future alive.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.356
Well, then, I guess this is the moment
that you tell me the truth.

16:30.656 --> 16:34.490
Almost there. Almost.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.702
I can't tell you everything that
happened between us until it's all over.

16:45.755 --> 16:46.744
Why not?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.704
Because if you knew
what I was really after,

16:48.799 --> 16:50.505
you'd do everything
in your power to stop me.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.259

(BREATH ES SHALLOWLY)

16:59.977 --> 17:01.228
What did you do?

17:02.730 --> 17:04.721
You have to stay calm and breathe.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.851
Shut up. I was a fake midwife.
I know the drill.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.649
Zelena, why would Emma do this?

17:08.736 --> 17:09.816
I have no idea!

17:09.904 --> 17:11.235
Are you sure it was her?

17:11.322 --> 17:13.233
Let's just say, when the Dark One
offers you onion rings,

17:13.324 --> 17:14.609
(GROANS) don't eat them!

17:14.659 --> 17:15.990
(SCREAMING)

17:18.704 --> 17:20.240
Someone scream for a doctor?

17:20.331 --> 17:22.993
There is an angry baby inside of me.
Get it out!

17:23.084 --> 17:26.247
You know, the last time I delivered
a baby, you tried to steal it.

17:26.879 --> 17:30.167
But why try to steal one when
making one is so much more fun, right?

17:32.134 --> 17:33.214
Dr. Whale.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.635
We really need
another doctor in this town.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.223
And what's with the dye job?

17:38.307 --> 17:40.684
Oh, so Emma changes her hair
and no one makes a fuss?

17:40.768 --> 17:42.599
But I get ridiculed, yeah?

17:42.687 --> 17:44.302
Come on, you know you like it.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.807
ZELENA: Oh, my God, stop talking!

17:45.898 --> 17:47.638
Didn't I kill you
the last time I was here?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.143
No, you just threw me across the room.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.100
I hope that doesn't happen again
this time.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.736
Okay. All business today. Got it.

17:54.824 --> 17:58.487
Uh, let's get those Vitals going,
get that baby out of you.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.784
MARY: Everybody get ready.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.201
We have to protect that baby
from Emma.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.449
-She's here?
-She will be soon.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.532
And we found that spell to destroy
light magic in Merlin's spell book.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.708
The only thing she needs,
other than Excalibur is...

18:07.795 --> 18:09.331
"The cries of a newborn child."

18:09.422 --> 18:11.754
Well, she's not taking this baby,
not while I'm still alive.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.253
Regina, take this cuff off

18:14.343 --> 18:16.629
so I can defend myself
and my child, please!

18:16.721 --> 18:18.427
You are far from trustworthy.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.130
But worry not, I'll protect the baby.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.341
-What happens to you, well...

who should I execute first?

18:34.989 --> 18:38.277
Hmm? Your boyfriend or your father?

18:43.039 --> 18:44.279
You can have the flame.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.033
Zelena, make sure that's real.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.265
Now you wanna give me my family
or keep fighting?

19:04.352 --> 19:05.558
Merlin!

19:06.145 --> 19:09.137
Please, Emma. Give him the flame.

defeat me, Emma.

It's no good. They're too strong.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.025
Keep trying.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.607
Merlin, you have to fight it.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.276
I can't!

20:01.409 --> 20:02.615
(CHOKING)

20:02.868 --> 20:05.359
You are the greatest sorcerer
that has ever lived.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.945
If you cannot fight off the darkness,
no one can.

20:15.965 --> 20:16.954
Aah!

20:17.133 --> 20:18.464
(GASPING)

20:20.052 --> 20:21.167
I said, kill her!

20:21.262 --> 20:23.594
By the sword, I command you!

20:23.681 --> 20:24.670
Kill her!

20:24.765 --> 20:26.380
I can't hold him off much longer.

20:31.939 --> 20:35.557
You will kill her.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.312
KILLIAN: Not today, mate.

Aah!

I'm okay.

21:06.724 --> 21:07.930
EMMA: Thank you.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.303
Easy, Swan.
You got tagged pretty good there.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.509
So did you.

21:12.146 --> 21:16.105
This thing? Well, I've had worse cuts
itching my nose with the wrong hand.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.020
(SHUSHES) Hold still.

21:21.071 --> 21:24.734
Thank you. Didn't even sting.

21:24.867 --> 21:28.405
And look at that. There's a sword.

21:31.582 --> 21:33.413
Killian, we did it.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.701
Now all I have to do is light the spark,

21:36.796 --> 21:38.582
and then we can get the darkness out.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.254
Well, then let's do it, go home.

21:50.184 --> 21:51.390
HENRY: You punched him?

21:51.936 --> 21:52.925
Awesome.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.932
Gave him a "left hook,"
if you know what I mean.

21:58.359 --> 21:59.724
DAVID: Well, the woods are clear.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.231
Zelena and Arthur must have retreated
somewhere far from here.

22:03.113 --> 22:05.650
I'm afraid Merlin won't be much help.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.027
Resisting Excalibur
has taken its toll on him.

22:08.118 --> 22:11.030
And Emma?
How's she doing with the spark?

22:11.121 --> 22:14.079
She said she needed some time alone.
She took it outside.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.417
REGINA: Need a light?

22:18.504 --> 22:19.914
Regina.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.291
I thought you can use a friend.

22:22.424 --> 22:23.459
(SIGHS)

22:23.843 --> 22:25.253
He's playing with me.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.711
He said I can't light it because
I'm not ready to let go of the darkness.

22:28.806 --> 22:30.342
Are you?

22:30.933 --> 22:32.639
-Regina.
-Hey,

22:33.519 --> 22:37.057
no one knows the lure of darkness
better than I do.

22:38.023 --> 22:41.265
You can lie to your parents.
You can lie to yourself.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.725
But you can't lie to me.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.651
I don't know.

22:44.738 --> 22:45.864
Feels good, doesn't it?

22:46.407 --> 22:50.616
Indulging every impulse.
Wielding great power.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.115
Doing whatever you want.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.448
Yes. Yes, it does.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.662
Is that wrong?

22:59.837 --> 23:01.077
(SIGHS)

23:02.256 --> 23:03.871
Of course it is.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.253
But it's also human.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.128
Look, I know you, Emma.

23:10.222 --> 23:14.215
It took a long time,
but I really know you.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.392
And you're not as weak as I once was.

23:16.478 --> 23:20.062
So if you're clinging to the darkness,
you have good reason.

23:20.149 --> 23:22.640
And it's beyond temptation.
So what is it?

23:23.611 --> 23:24.976
I don't know.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.526
There's a difference between

23:26.614 --> 23:31.199
not knowing something
and not wanting to admit it.

23:31.285 --> 23:33.697
Those walls you put up, Emma,

23:34.455 --> 23:35.865
it's time they come down.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.575
What are you doing?

23:37.666 --> 23:39.531
Helping you break the walls.

23:39.627 --> 23:43.620
As your friend,
I command you, Dark One,

23:43.714 --> 23:46.956
tell me, why are you so afraid
to give up the darkness?

23:47.051 --> 23:49.463
Once I let it go,
I won't be able to protect my family.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.343
-Now, the truth.
-It is.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.887
Regina, please.

23:57.978 --> 24:00.060
No, it's not.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.728
You just have to be brave enough

24:01.815 --> 24:04.227
to knock down all those walls
you're hiding behind.

24:04.318 --> 24:06.309
The dagger can make you look,
but you...

24:06.403 --> 24:08.439
You have to choose to see.
Now, come on.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.737
Come on, Emma, see.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.405
Tell me what you're really afraid of.

24:12.493 --> 24:13.528
Regina, what're you doing?

24:13.619 --> 24:14.779
I'm getting answers.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.452
-By controlling her? That's enough!
-(SCOFFS)

24:17.539 --> 24:19.791
Are you all right?

24:23.671 --> 24:25.787
You really think you're helping her
by being cruel?

24:25.881 --> 24:27.291
REGINA: I wasn't cruel.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.544
I've been cruel,
and trust me, you'd know it.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.045
I was getting to the truth.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.633
It's not my fault that it's painful.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.294
Your insane girlfriend
sped up my pregnancy,

26:35.385 --> 26:37.421
kidnapped me right after giving birth

26:37.513 --> 26:40.550
and separated me from my little girl.

26:40.641 --> 26:41.972
And they say I'm wicked.

26:42.059 --> 26:45.142
Why would she do that?
What does she need you for?

26:45.229 --> 26:48.221
From the looks of things,
she's casting a spell to steal my magic.

I'm not taking Zelena's magic.
I'm giving her mine instead.

What?

26:55.489 --> 26:59.778
Killian, you were right.
My plan is not to destroy light magic.

26:59.868 --> 27:04.111
It has been to destroy dark magic.
The dark magic that's inside of me.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.412
If that were true,

27:05.499 --> 27:08.286
then why keep it a secret from me
or the rest of your family?

do what was necessary
to get the job done.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.455
And that's where I come in.

Yes. The darkness needs
to be contained in a vessel. You.

27:18.387 --> 27:19.843
Emma, what're you going to do?

27:19.930 --> 27:21.170
What needs to be done.

27:21.265 --> 27:24.507
I'm going to cut her down
with Excalibur's enchanted blade.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.183
And the darkness
will be vanquished forever.

I don't want anyone to get hurt
who doesn't have to. There are limits.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.770
You call those limits, Emma?

27:34.862 --> 27:36.648
You're still talking about
cold-blooded murder.

27:36.738 --> 27:39.400
Killian, she killed Neal and Marian.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.106
Given time, she will kill you, too.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.862
After today you can be certain.

27:42.953 --> 27:46.116
This isn't about Zelena, Emma.
It's about you.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.914
We went to Camelot for Merlin's help.

27:50.002 --> 27:54.371
Surely he has a solution to
the darkness that doesn't require this.

27:54.464 --> 27:56.125
Merlin can't help us anymore.

I've been looking everywhere for you.

28:18.071 --> 28:21.359
Dagger's right here. Regina was
going to use it on me, why not you?

28:21.450 --> 28:24.237
What she did was wrong.
I'm sorry it had to happen.

28:25.329 --> 28:26.910
That's funny, I'm not.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.203
She's right.

28:28.290 --> 28:31.407
I do know why I'm scared
to let go of the darkness.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.708
Because of her,
I finally admitted it to myself.

28:34.338 --> 28:36.124
What are you so afraid of, love?

28:37.758 --> 28:39.965
This. Our future.

KILLIAN: I see you talked to Henry.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.258
Sometimes I forget
that boys can't keep secrets.

28:45.349 --> 28:46.429
Don't blame him.

28:46.516 --> 28:47.892
He just thought it would help

28:47.976 --> 28:50.934
if I knew what I had to look forward to
when we got home.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.644
What're you trying to tell me here?

28:53.774 --> 28:55.514
That you can't ignite
the Promethean Flame

28:55.609 --> 28:58.146
because you're afraid to take the plunge
and move in with me?

28:58.237 --> 28:59.773
It's not about moving in.

29:02.449 --> 29:03.814
It's everything.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.399
When I told you I loved you
back in Storybrooke,

29:05.494 --> 29:07.485
it was because I thought
I was never going to see you again.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.285
It was the same way with Neal.

29:09.373 --> 29:12.456
I could only admit my true feelings
when I thought I was losing him.

29:12.542 --> 29:13.622
And you.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.035
Well, I guess it's even worse
than I thought.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.507
You can't even see
any future at all with me.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.547
That's not it. Don't you get it?

29:22.636 --> 29:25.469
I'm afraid
because I do want a future with you.

29:26.848 --> 29:27.883
You do?

29:27.975 --> 29:29.215
Yes.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.225
And the minute
you take away the darkness,

29:32.312 --> 29:34.268
that future begins.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.267
I know it sounds crazy.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.895
It doesn't sound crazy at all, Emma.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.856
That sounds like music
to this pirate's ears.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.609
You just have to trust me.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.315

is as good as mine.

All I know is no one hurts my sister
but me.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.018
What're you planning to do
once you find Emma?

30:15.397 --> 30:16.728
Oh, it's simple.

30:16.815 --> 30:21.650
I'm going to show the Dark Swan
what dark magic really looks like.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.238
Do you hear Emma
pacing around up there?

30:27.326 --> 30:29.032
You're her boy toy.
What do you think she's up to?

30:29.119 --> 30:30.984
I'm no one's toy.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.070
And we need to find a way
to get rid of these iron shackles

30:33.165 --> 30:34.655
before Emma gets back.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.082
Those shackles aren't the problem.
This one is.

30:37.169 --> 30:40.707
When Regina put it back on, she
enchanted my wrist and I can't cut it off.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.755
Without magic,
we're never gonna get out of here alive.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.634
Well, it's a good thing
I happen to have some, then.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.928
What? You've got magic?

30:50.015 --> 30:52.472
No, my hook does.

30:52.559 --> 30:56.268
As you recall, I imbued it with magic
to rip your heart out.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.438
Well, go on, then.
What're you waiting for?

31:00.484 --> 31:03.442
The last time I tried helping you,
you betrayed me.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.108
-How do I know I can trust you now?
-You don't.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.447
But you also don't have a choice.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.113

she gave me the dagger.

you helped me

37:06.725 --> 37:08.465
Our future is now.

37:09.477 --> 37:12.344
Reunite the blades
so I can see them before I go.

37:12.772 --> 37:13.852
(GRUNTS)

37:14.733 --> 37:15.722
No.

37:15.817 --> 37:17.057
No?

37:17.152 --> 37:19.359
I'm not gonna let him die
when I know there's a way to save him.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.023
REGINA: Emma,

37:21.156 --> 37:23.488
Merlin said it.
There's nothing you can do.

37:23.533 --> 37:26.320
That's what he said.
But it's not true, is it?

37:26.411 --> 37:29.369
You told me how powerful I am.
Let's use that power.

37:29.497 --> 37:32.864
I can use the Promethean Flame
to release you from Excalibur,

37:33.001 --> 37:36.585
and then I can use it to tether Hook's
life to it, instead. It could save him.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.377
Emma, you know what that could do.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.542
Create another Dark One.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.417
It would multiply the darkness
so that it cannot be destroyed.

37:43.511 --> 37:46.503
Not without you paying
the steepest of prices.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.008
And it will be your final step
into the dark.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.262
I don't care what happens to me.

37:51.352 --> 37:54.059
-Emma, wait.
-Please, listen. You can't.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.895
Emma, your parents are right.

37:56.024 --> 37:59.187
If you could've saved Daniel or Robin...
Look how far you were willing to go,

37:59.277 --> 38:01.359
how far you pushed me to save him.

38:03.364 --> 38:05.650
(VOICE BREAKING)
I'm not gonna lose Killian.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.361
I won't let anyone stop me.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.284
(WEAKLY) Emma...

38:19.047 --> 38:20.412
Killian.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.000
(KILLIAN GRUNTS)

38:24.219 --> 38:25.880
EMMA: You're going to be okay.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.380
No, please.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.555
You have to let me go.

38:31.684 --> 38:34.391
(GROANS)
I don't want to pay this price.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.428
I don't wanna become that.

38:36.564 --> 38:37.940
You won't.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.102
You can fight the darkness.
I can help you.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.816
We can do it together.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.234
I'm not as strong as you are.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.979
Or Merlin. I'm weak.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.941
The things I've done, I've done.

38:49.077 --> 38:52.069
I've succumbed to darkness
before in my life.

38:52.121 --> 38:54.908
And it took centuries to push it away.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.787
I don't know if I can do it again.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.747
But our future.

39:01.297 --> 39:04.915
I'll just be happy
knowing that you'll have one.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.128
Ah!

39:06.678 --> 39:08.134
(KILLIAN GROANS)

39:13.935 --> 39:16.267
That's not enough for me!

39:16.312 --> 39:17.688
(CRYING)

39:27.282 --> 39:29.068
(BUZZING)

39:30.201 --> 39:32.032
(WHOOSHING)

39:36.624 --> 39:37.659
What's happening?

39:41.296 --> 39:43.127
It's too late.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.480
(SIGHS)

40:50.031 --> 40:51.862
I'm so sorry, Killian.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.903
But I did not have a choice.

40:55.036 --> 40:56.276
KILLIAN: No, no, no.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.369
No, there has to be
some other explanation.

40:59.749 --> 41:00.864
Aw.

41:01.250 --> 41:04.538
Are you finding the truth
hard to swallow?

41:04.921 --> 41:05.910
Here.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.050
Have a look at the sword.

41:14.389 --> 41:16.300
A glamor spell. (CHUCKLES)

41:16.724 --> 41:19.966
It was there the whole time,
right under your nose,

41:20.061 --> 41:21.642
and you didn't even see it.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.230
(LAUGHS)

41:23.314 --> 41:27.148
Ooh, I suppose it's not
"the Dark One" anymore, iS it?

41:27.235 --> 41:29.817
More like "the Dark Ones."

41:29.904 --> 41:32.566
So that's why
you saved my life twice tonight.

41:34.075 --> 41:37.238
I was never in any danger. You just
wanted to keep me from the truth.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.740
I wanted to fix it first
to make up for what I had done.

41:39.789 --> 41:41.950
By killing me? How sweet.

41:42.083 --> 41:46.577
It was the only way to destroy
the darkness in both of US.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.287
Everything I've done
Since we got back to Storybrooke

41:49.424 --> 41:51.255
was to try to save you, Killian.

41:51.342 --> 41:55.005
This iS saving?
How could you do this to me?

41:55.930 --> 41:57.010
I'm sorry.

41:57.807 --> 42:00.264
So much for our future, Swan.

42:00.309 --> 42:01.515
(CHUCKLES)

42:02.812 --> 42:04.768
ZELENA: Now, tell me,

42:04.856 --> 42:07.643
are you ready to learn
what else happened in Camelot?

42:11.863 --> 42:13.273
Aye.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.941
But first we have to take care of her.
