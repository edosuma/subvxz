Previously on Powers...

00:17.768 --> 00:21.689
It is my very sad duty
to report that Retro Girl
has been murdered.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.441
Because Walker
is not on this case.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.608
Fuck it!

CROSS:
You know as well as I do

00:26.193 --> 00:27.570

00:27.653 --> 00:29.155
Three Powers killed my mom.

00:29.738 --> 00:30.865

The bill I'm proposing

00:43.127 --> 00:45.713

WALKER: Nobody's seen you
in 40 years.

00:56.307 --> 00:59.226
We could use SuperShock
now more than ever.

00:59.310 --> 01:00.519
I made
myself a promise

01:00.644 --> 01:02.730
that I'd never put back on
that uniform,

01:02.813 --> 01:04.190

gonna do it.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.798

everyone wanted
to be a part of it...

02:10.881 --> 02:13.801

02:13.884 --> 02:16.095
Who made the invite list?
Stay tuned.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.138
But first, we're gonna
show you exclusive footage

02:18.222 --> 02:20.224

murder scene.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.600
Again, we must warn you,

02:21.725 --> 02:23.936
this footage is not

02:46.083 --> 02:49.003

03:18.741 --> 03:20.492

Surprise.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.078
Calista?

03:24.330 --> 03:26.832
You broke into my house
dressed like her?

03:26.957 --> 03:28.709
No, that's...that's not
what this is about.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.294
I... I wanted to show you.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.630
You wanted to show me
so you broke into my house?

03:32.755 --> 03:34.131
I wanted to show you
what I could do.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.966
I... I wanted to show
you that I...

03:36.050 --> 03:37.718
I could take her place...
Take her place?

03:37.801 --> 03:39.219
Are you
fucking with me?

03:39.303 --> 03:40.721
What is
wrong with you?

03:40.804 --> 03:42.848
She's gone!
You can't take her place!

03:42.973 --> 03:44.683
Nothing you can do
can bring her back.

03:44.808 --> 03:45.893
You do not
have powers.

03:53.359 --> 03:54.610
(SCOFFS)

03:57.154 --> 03:58.530
When did
you get them?

(STAMMERS) It doesn't matter.
Look, listen to me.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.161
Calista, you can't
do this now.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.789
She's dead.
You understand?

04:06.872 --> 04:08.332
You want to
end up like her?

04:10.876 --> 04:12.670
Calista, listen to me.
Calista...

04:12.795 --> 04:14.880
Would you please listen to me
for one second?

04:17.508 --> 04:18.634
I...

04:21.178 --> 04:22.179
Awesome.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.172
And with every hour,
more details are revealed

04:57.256 --> 04:59.133
into the sad and twisted world

04:59.216 --> 05:01.343
of the young man
who killed Retro Girl.

05:01.427 --> 05:04.096
Krispin Stockley, son of
a Powers Division detective,

05:04.221 --> 05:07.433
left a long and somewhat
rambling public manifesto

05:07.558 --> 05:09.184
that local police and the FBI

05:09.268 --> 05:11.311
still have not commented on.

05:11.395 --> 05:12.730
But from our understanding,
the police

05:12.813 --> 05:15.023
consider the case closed.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.401
People all over the world
are still reeling

05:17.484 --> 05:20.112
from this seemingly
impossible nightmare.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.572
The Retro Girl funeral
will be held

05:21.655 --> 05:23.240
later today at Unity Hall

05:23.323 --> 05:26.368
and crowds are expected
to be enormous.

05:26.452 --> 05:28.662
And with Retro Girl no longer
protecting the city,

05:28.746 --> 05:30.289
many are wondering
if the funeral might be

05:30.414 --> 05:32.833
a target for a Powers
terrorist attack.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.084
I say we let the city burn

05:34.168 --> 05:35.210
and whoever's alive
in the morning

05:35.294 --> 05:36.628
gets to clean it up.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.339
It's always better
when you don't talk.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.801
Yes, anything could happen

05:42.926 --> 05:45.387
today, tonight, tomorrow,
so be prepared.

05:45.471 --> 05:47.681
Gang fights, riots, looting.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.268
The FBI have been kind enough
to stay and help.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.979
KUTTER: Are we worried
about the Quantums?

05:54.104 --> 05:55.272
'Cause I'm worried
about the Quantums.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.107
Those low-level
Powers shitheads?

05:57.191 --> 05:59.151
Oh, okay, one is a shithead,
the rest...

05:59.276 --> 06:01.278
...altogether, they're
some crazy shit.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.280
Yes, the Quantums
and the Hacks

06:03.363 --> 06:06.700
have been in a blood feud
since I was a beat cop.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.285
And yes, those Powers,
individually,

06:08.368 --> 06:10.162
are Level One
or Two's at best,

06:10.287 --> 06:12.456
but as a group, as a gang,

06:12.539 --> 06:15.000
they could be, and have been,
real trouble for us.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.045
KUTTER: Yeah, we should
do like they do
in Detroit, right?

06:18.128 --> 06:19.421
Go to their territory,

06:19.505 --> 06:21.632
set up shop,
bust some heads,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.383
let 'em know what's what,
and then...
And rile them up...

06:23.467 --> 06:25.427
into a full-blown
Powers gang war?

06:25.511 --> 06:26.887
Okay, it's not how...
What?

06:26.970 --> 06:29.097
The problem is,
without Retro Girl,

06:29.181 --> 06:31.058
without Olympia, (SIGHS)

06:31.141 --> 06:32.893
I'm not sure what they'll do.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.187
Just the existence
of Retro Girl

06:35.312 --> 06:37.105
kept them on the down low.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.150
I don't know what
their mind-set is now.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.986
WALKER: I could talk to 'em.

06:44.822 --> 06:48.075
I know their leader, Nucleus,
from back when it was...

06:49.493 --> 06:52.412
...my more colorful days.

from burning
before the funeral.

PELHAM: Our topic tonight,
with Retro Girl gone,

22:34.061 --> 22:35.605
with Olympia gone,

22:35.688 --> 22:37.940
concerns are running high
that the streets of this city

22:38.065 --> 22:40.067
are no longer safe.

22:40.151 --> 22:41.402
Most of the people
we've talked to

22:41.486 --> 22:43.279
feel that all hell's
gonna break loose

22:43.404 --> 22:46.115
and there's nothing any of us
can do to stop it.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.283
Certainly not the police,

22:47.408 --> 22:49.952
and certainly not
Powers Division.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.497
The world needs
another Retro Girl...

22:52.622 --> 22:56.417

keeps things at an even keel.

22:56.501 --> 22:58.836

to the occasion?

22:58.961 --> 23:01.005

23:01.130 --> 23:04.509

SuperShock?

23:04.634 --> 23:07.720
We haven't seen or heard from
him since before I was born.

23:07.804 --> 23:10.973
And in this reporter's
opinion, it's gonna be
a very long time

23:11.098 --> 23:15.144
before we see anyone who even
comes close to a Retro Girl.

23:15.269 --> 23:17.855
And by that time,
it's probably
gonna be too late.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.525
at the Retro Girl funeral.

35:09.858 --> 35:12.736
Powers Division was successful
in suppressing the chaos

35:12.861 --> 35:14.947
before anyone was badly hurt.

35:15.948 --> 35:17.616
We're still looking
into the appearance

35:17.699 --> 35:21.411
of this new mystery Power
dressed as Retro Girl,

35:21.537 --> 35:24.331
and we'll keep updating you
as more information comes in.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.051
They should open a Starbucks
on this rooftop.

35:37.302 --> 35:38.387
Hey.

35:38.512 --> 35:39.972
Are you okay?

35:41.014 --> 35:42.099
No.

35:44.226 --> 35:46.353
Krispin
didn't kill Janice.

35:47.396 --> 35:49.022
So it was the guy
from the riot?

35:49.106 --> 35:51.024
Yeah.
His name's THX.

35:51.108 --> 35:52.317
He's a Hack.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.653
They're booking him now.

35:55.070 --> 35:57.364
I'm gonna have to go down
and work him over.

35:57.447 --> 35:58.949
I can help
you with that.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.076
No.

36:01.577 --> 36:03.370
Hey, Calista.

36:03.537 --> 36:05.247
We have to do this
the right way.

36:05.372 --> 36:06.665
By the book.

36:06.748 --> 36:09.710
Ripping his head off
is not gonna help us
solve the case.

36:09.793 --> 36:11.295
It'll make us
feel better.

36:14.006 --> 36:16.466
Calista, if I could impart
anything to you,

36:17.175 --> 36:19.386
it's that with,
with these powers,

36:19.469 --> 36:22.264
you know,
with these great powers...

36:22.598 --> 36:23.765
Are you about
to tell me that,

36:23.849 --> 36:26.393
"With great power
comes great responsibility?"

36:26.476 --> 36:27.603
Well, yeah.

36:27.728 --> 36:30.272
Hey, look.
It's...it's true, okay?

36:30.397 --> 36:32.316
When people
look at you now,

36:32.816 --> 36:34.568
they won't
see a person.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.361
They don't see you.

36:37.070 --> 36:40.073
They see the ideal.
The symbol.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.451
And you? I mean...

36:42.534 --> 36:43.952
(CHUCKLES) Look at you.

36:44.036 --> 36:47.205
You've stepped into the shoes
of the ultimate hero.

36:48.081 --> 36:49.791
That's a big
responsibility.

36:55.964 --> 37:00.177
I've made just about every
mistake a Power can make.

37:01.261 --> 37:04.681
I was arrogant, and selfish,

37:04.806 --> 37:06.475
and greedy, and stupid.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.977
What I'm trying to say is,

37:09.102 --> 37:11.188
you can learn
from my mistakes.

37:12.856 --> 37:14.316
Let me help you.

37:16.318 --> 37:19.112
Or just run off and do
what you always do.

37:19.196 --> 37:21.323
The last time that you
and I were on this roof,

37:21.406 --> 37:22.824
you jumped off
to try to save me.

37:22.949 --> 37:24.368
You risked your life...

37:25.243 --> 37:27.954
...even though you knew
that you didn't have
a chance in hell.

37:29.331 --> 37:30.957
Not the smartest thing
I've ever done.

37:31.041 --> 37:33.543
No, but it was heroic.

37:34.878 --> 37:36.505
I admire that.

37:39.049 --> 37:40.467
You okay?

37:42.344 --> 37:44.346
Have you found
a place to stay?

37:44.471 --> 37:45.931
What are you
doing for money?

37:46.348 --> 37:47.683
I got a job.

37:48.392 --> 37:49.726
I'm a waitress.

37:49.851 --> 37:51.520
Okay, that's good.

37:51.603 --> 37:52.938
Good?
Yeah.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.231
Work is work.

37:54.648 --> 37:56.692
They're talking about me
on Powers That Be.

37:56.817 --> 37:59.027
Yeah, I know.
They will.

37:59.528 --> 38:01.279
Get used to it, okay?

38:02.614 --> 38:04.825
Okay, so how do I find out
what level Power I am?

38:05.367 --> 38:07.869
Well, you come down
to the station

38:07.994 --> 38:09.955
and we
register your powers.

38:10.414 --> 38:11.790
What, like paperwork?

38:12.040 --> 38:13.083
Yeah.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.876
What...what other
powers do you have?

38:15.085 --> 38:17.045
Can you do anything
with your eyes?

38:17.295 --> 38:19.506
Um, how do
I find out?

38:20.132 --> 38:22.259
You just, uh,
concentrate on something,

38:23.051 --> 38:25.470
and, uh...no, Jesus,
don't do it to me.

38:25.554 --> 38:26.930
Oh, sorry.
Uh...

38:27.305 --> 38:29.057
Let's...let's do this.

38:29.182 --> 38:31.560
So, look at the vent.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.729
Okay, pick a spot
and focus on it,

38:33.854 --> 38:35.063
and see if
you can melt it.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.649
And a bird hit me
when I was flying.

38:37.733 --> 38:38.942
No, you...you hit it.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.235
No, it hit me.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.903
No, you hit the bird.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.905
Which one of you
is supposed to be up there?

38:43.989 --> 38:44.990
I can't believe
you're taking its side.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.366
I'm not taking its side.

38:46.450 --> 38:47.784
The bird has
right-of-way, okay?

38:47.909 --> 38:49.286

Same as planes, helicopters.

they have right-of-way.

38:54.458 --> 38:55.542
Focus.

This isn't working.
You don't feel anything?
