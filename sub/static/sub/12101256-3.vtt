34:31.344 --> 34:33.978
Alexandra.

34:34.055 --> 34:36.231
You must take my son.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.575
Take my son.

34:38.652 --> 34:39.984
Now, flee.

34:40.061 --> 34:40.693
Flee.

34:40.770 --> 34:42.412
All of you, flee.

34:42.489 --> 34:44.581
What of Bathory and Jack?

34:44.658 --> 34:47.584
Their fate is in
their own hands now.

34:47.661 --> 34:51.088
But my child, I entrust
to yours.

34:51.164 --> 34:53.498
But what of you,
Your Grace?

34:53.575 --> 34:54.499
You are gravely wounded.

34:54.534 --> 34:56.751
There is only one thing left
that I can do.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.586
Be brave, Florian.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.097
Flee.

35:00.173 --> 35:01.172
Go.

35:01.249 --> 35:03.049
Flee. Flee.

35:03.126 --> 35:04.643
Flee!

35:05.628 --> 35:08.480
[thunder rolls]

35:21.194 --> 35:24.237
Michaela, we can destroy
her together.

35:24.314 --> 35:27.124
Take back the part of me
that she stole.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.449
I told you, Jack.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.034
You cannot win!

35:30.111 --> 35:33.130
Now you will learn what it is
like to lose your head

35:33.206 --> 35:37.008
and no one to put it back on
for you!

35:42.382 --> 35:46.643
That part of her, the darkness,
it's inside me.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.387
No. My fight against the dark
is slipping.

35:49.464 --> 35:53.266
Our gambit failed, but you must
fashion another chance

35:53.343 --> 35:58.029
and I must accept
my dark fate.

36:01.234 --> 36:04.202
[chanting]

36:40.440 --> 36:42.741
Be well, my son.

36:44.560 --> 36:48.488
Let the light guide you
to safety

36:48.564 --> 36:52.667
and may it purge the evil
from this land.

37:11.730 --> 37:15.232
Arise, my sweet.

37:15.308 --> 37:18.777
Prepare to embrace
your transformation.

37:30.249 --> 37:35.794
In blindness I now
see everything.

37:42.744 --> 37:46.471
I am the Oracle.

37:52.879 --> 37:55.146
[groans]

37:59.427 --> 38:00.443
You made it.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.820
Where's Bathory?

38:03.806 --> 38:04.781
The Dark One.

38:04.858 --> 38:07.284
Part of her,
it's inside of me.

38:10.313 --> 38:12.289
Do as Bathory told you.

38:12.365 --> 38:13.698
Purge this into the amulet.

38:13.733 --> 38:16.167
It was made to contain
the darkness.

38:21.949 --> 38:25.209
[gasping]

38:25.286 --> 38:27.420
That evil, it could have
taken over.

38:27.497 --> 38:28.471
Not now.

38:28.548 --> 38:29.589
Evil lost.

38:29.665 --> 38:31.632
One small victory.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.217
<i> [distant screams]</i>

38:33.294 --> 38:34.853
We gotta get the hell out
of here.

38:37.298 --> 38:39.190
[explosion]

38:52.814 --> 38:55.582
[bell tolling]

38:56.168 --> 38:59.077
Thank you for getting me here.

38:59.153 --> 39:00.453
In more ways than one.

39:00.530 --> 39:02.914
Are you sure about this?

39:02.990 --> 39:04.507
A voyage to the new world?

39:04.584 --> 39:06.676
I have to get as far away
as I can from the Dark One

39:06.753 --> 39:09.087
and whoever she sends
after me.

39:09.122 --> 39:12.682
Besides, America is my home.

39:12.759 --> 39:16.761
Yes, but... not now.

39:16.796 --> 39:18.096
Not yet.

39:18.172 --> 39:20.774
That's tomorrow's problem.

39:22.718 --> 39:24.602
You look after him.

39:24.679 --> 39:26.863
Nobody can know
who he really is.

39:26.940 --> 39:28.940
You have my word.

39:29.016 --> 39:32.035
I will raise him
as my own.

39:36.899 --> 39:39.167
I saw you sketching me in this.

39:40.736 --> 39:43.046
That's when I knew.

39:46.793 --> 39:49.127
Fate is part of my story.

39:49.203 --> 39:51.805
Maybe it always was.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.675
But shouldn't this and
the amulet remain with you?

39:55.751 --> 39:58.228
I changed a small piece
in this story,

39:58.304 --> 40:00.513
but the Dark One still rose

40:00.590 --> 40:03.808
and the Oracle and Michaela
are with her.

40:03.843 --> 40:06.227
The amulet and the book,
they both made it

40:06.238 --> 40:09.021
from the Romas to the
Van Helsings once before.

40:09.098 --> 40:10.982
Maybe they will again.

40:11.058 --> 40:13.535
I have to have my faith in that.

40:15.321 --> 40:19.791
I wrote a note under that sketch
for the ones that follow.

40:20.735 --> 40:23.586
Maybe one day this
will all make sense.

40:23.663 --> 40:26.297
After everything comes
full circle.

40:32.172 --> 40:33.054
That's it.

40:39.253 --> 40:40.678
Thank you.

40:40.755 --> 40:42.188
No, Jack.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.943
Thank you.

40:57.030 --> 40:59.789
Thank you for everything
you've done for us.

41:00.107 --> 41:02.033
I did what I could.

41:02.068 --> 41:04.702
And the rest?

41:04.737 --> 41:06.212
Who knows.

41:15.122 --> 41:17.590
If we have to hide
baby Christoph

41:17.667 --> 41:19.976
he will need a new name.

41:25.391 --> 41:29.861
Maybe the best way to remember
a Van Helsing is to make one.

41:31.064 --> 41:32.897
What about Jack?

41:32.932 --> 41:35.241
Jack Van Helsing.

42:12.722 --> 42:15.106
Something has changed.

42:15.141 --> 42:18.243
Things are not as
they once were.

42:21.147 --> 42:23.698
I know.  I sense it too.

42:23.708 --> 42:27.669
Part of my strength is missing.

42:30.406 --> 42:34.259
The past has altered.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.801
[gasps]

42:43.878 --> 42:46.437
The Van Helsings.
