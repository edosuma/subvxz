00:36.036 --> 00:38.438
Don't... don't
cut me with that.

00:38.438 --> 00:39.639
Stop your blubbering.

00:39.639 --> 00:41.641
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead already.

00:41.641 --> 00:42.442
Where's my urn?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.645
Make me look for it
and I'll take you to places

00:45.645 --> 00:47.647
you never thought pain can go.

00:47.647 --> 00:49.649
And I'll take my time.

00:50.050 --> 00:55.255
I...
I think I know what you're
looking for in the wall safe.

01:17.277 --> 01:18.478
Easy, easy.

01:18.478 --> 01:20.480
She's been cooped
up a long time.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.088
I tried the front door.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.689
It was locked.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.299
You're a dead man.

01:43.303 --> 01:44.904
Hi.

01:46.506 --> 01:49.309
Hey, you can
look, but don't touch.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.140
You are really
starting to piss me off.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.745
And you?

02:33.353 --> 02:34.954
Huh.

02:34.954 --> 02:36.956
Ugh.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.759
Agh.

02:49.769 --> 02:50.570
You see that?

02:50.570 --> 02:52.572
I sure did.

02:58.978 --> 03:01.381
Adam's going to be pissed.

04:10.617 --> 04:13.019
Months go by with
nothing weird to report.

04:13.019 --> 04:14.621
Then everything goes to hell.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.623
In the last week we've
seen teenaged girls burst

04:17.023 --> 04:17.824
into flames in gym class...

04:17.824 --> 04:19.425
What the hell
were you two thinking?

04:19.425 --> 04:21.427
If I hadn't tracked
you down, then what?

04:21.427 --> 04:23.830
Ashlocke was already gone
by the time you got there.

04:23.830 --> 04:26.633
And tonight, somebody
just strolled through Neal

04:27.033 --> 04:29.435
Varadi's web of security,
brutally murdering the

04:29.435 --> 04:31.838
mega-billionaire and
his staff, and getting away

04:32.238 --> 04:34.240
without a trace.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.441
The cops are flabbergasted.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.643
Right.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.244
So what were you doing
there in the first place?

04:38.244 --> 04:39.846
I tracked Ashlocke
from the Strand.

04:39.846 --> 04:40.647
Uh huh.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.248
And I followed her there.

04:42.248 --> 04:43.449
What?

04:43.449 --> 04:45.051
I'm supposed to let
you get yourself killed?

04:45.051 --> 04:47.453
Well, if I go, I'm
taking Ashlocke with me.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.055
Yeah, that's beautiful.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.059
Good grief.

04:55.061 --> 04:58.264
You know, those
people were massacred.

04:58.264 --> 04:59.866
Somebody has to stop him.

04:59.866 --> 05:02.268
You know, the only
reason we survived is because

05:02.268 --> 05:04.270
Ashlocke almost
passed out back there.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.471
Yeah, like he
was sick or something.

05:05.872 --> 05:06.673
Yeah.

05:06.673 --> 05:07.874
What?

05:07.874 --> 05:10.276
Like physically sick?

05:10.677 --> 05:11.477
Hunh.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.079
Think we can take him down?

05:13.479 --> 05:15.081
Well, this could be
the opportunity that we've

05:15.081 --> 05:16.282
been waiting for.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.884
Use his weakness against him.

05:17.884 --> 05:20.687
No, actually I'm
talking about a cure.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.689
Oh, that's a good idea.

05:22.689 --> 05:26.292
Let's just keep him
around a little while longer.

05:42.308 --> 05:44.310
I'm fine, Aziza.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.312
I just overdid it.

05:46.312 --> 05:51.517
Indulge me.

05:57.523 --> 06:01.928
I'd be through a lot faster
if you would just relax.

06:01.928 --> 06:04.731
You know, it's a
good thing I love you.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.733
Anybody else talked
me like that they'd be dead...

06:06.733 --> 06:10.336
Spare me, Gabriel.

06:10.336 --> 06:14.741
This won't take long.

06:27.553 --> 06:31.557
When are you going
to stop playing hard to get?

06:31.557 --> 06:35.962
We both know we
were meant to be together.

06:36.362 --> 06:37.563
You okay?

06:37.563 --> 06:39.966
I heard something.

06:40.366 --> 06:42.368
Where'd he go?

06:42.368 --> 06:43.970
Did you see him?

06:43.970 --> 06:45.571
Who?

06:45.571 --> 06:47.573
Ashlocke was here.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.777
He's not here.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.179
It's just in your mind.

06:53.179 --> 06:57.583
No.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.585
It's okay.

07:12.398 --> 07:16.002
Gabriel?

07:16.002 --> 07:18.404
Are you in there?

07:26.012 --> 07:28.414
I guess I just got
so comfortable, I got lost in

07:28.414 --> 07:31.617
the magic of your touch.

07:42.028 --> 07:46.032
So I take it I'm dying.

07:46.032 --> 07:50.036
The most powerful man alive.

07:50.036 --> 07:53.639
That power is
what's killing you.

07:54.040 --> 07:58.044
Your accelerated metabolism
in tandem with the

07:58.044 --> 08:01.647
rapid mutation of your genes.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.851
What can you do?

08:04.851 --> 08:07.253
Other than make you
as comfortable as possible for

08:07.253 --> 08:13.259
the time
you have left, nothing.

08:13.259 --> 08:16.062
I didn't rot in that
pod for twenty-five years

08:16.062 --> 08:17.663
just to drop dead.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.466
I'm afraid that's
exactly the way that it is.

08:20.466 --> 08:22.068
You don't understand.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.070
I was born to rule.

08:24.070 --> 08:27.673
It's the ones who
get in my way who die.

08:34.881 --> 08:35.681
All right.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.283
We need to take
advantage of Ashlocke's

08:37.283 --> 08:38.885
vulnerability right now.

08:38.885 --> 08:39.684
Well, yeah,
hit him hard and fast.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.287
No, no.

08:41.287 --> 08:42.889
I'm talking more in
the lines of a rescue mission.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.490
You know, we're
not executioners.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.092
You're talking about rescuing
the guy who wants to kill us?

08:46.092 --> 08:48.494
That's right, and I need you
to put your anger behind you.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.096
I need you two to
go out there and get me a

08:50.096 --> 08:52.899
current sample of his
DNA so I can save this guy.

08:53.299 --> 08:54.901
All right.

08:54.901 --> 08:57.303
Let's go.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.315
They're not fantasies.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.317
They were flesh and
blood, as real as you and me.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.919
Oh, come on.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.921
They called it alchemy,
and what they were doing

09:14.921 --> 09:18.124
was no more magical than
gene splicing or DNA therapy.

09:18.524 --> 09:20.126
Unless you're going
somewhere with this we...

09:20.126 --> 09:22.528
I'm definitely going somewhere.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.933
Why do you think I went
to so much trouble to get

09:27.333 --> 09:29.735
my hands on that burial urn?

09:34.140 --> 09:35.341
Jesse!

09:35.341 --> 09:36.542
Jess!

09:36.542 --> 09:37.743
Oh, sorry.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.345
Sorry. I'm sorry.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.546
I was... still not used to...

09:40.947 --> 09:42.548
I know.

09:42.548 --> 09:45.351
Just be careful, that hurt.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.759
Still sure sending
them in was a good idea?

09:53.759 --> 09:55.761
You mean, instead
of sending you in?

09:56.162 --> 09:57.363
Well, let's face it.

09:57.363 --> 09:59.365
I know a little more
about breaking and entering.

09:59.365 --> 10:00.967
And a lot more about
diving in first and checking

10:01.367 --> 10:04.570
for sharks later.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.572
I don't know, Adam,
you really think this thing's

10:06.572 --> 10:08.174
going to work?

10:08.174 --> 10:09.775
Well, it's not like
I can do a run through --

10:09.775 --> 10:10.977
we're just going
to have to bust in there

10:11.377 --> 10:12.578
and hit him with it.

10:12.578 --> 10:14.981
Yeah? What if it doesn't work?

10:15.381 --> 10:16.983
We go to Plan B.

10:16.983 --> 10:18.584
Huh.

10:18.584 --> 10:21.387
Be great except
we don't have a Plan B.

10:21.387 --> 10:24.190
You're kidding
about this, right?

10:24.190 --> 10:26.592
You can't cure him, you know?

10:26.592 --> 10:28.194
Well, what do you suggest?

10:28.194 --> 10:29.395
You know exactly what I think --

10:29.395 --> 10:30.997
we should take him
out and be done with it.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.598
Look, I have an opportunity
here to try to ...

10:32.598 --> 10:33.799
This isn't about you.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.602
Well, it's not about you.

10:43.409 --> 10:44.610
Look, you want to break
something, that's fine.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.612
Just don't break it in here.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.429
Jesse.

11:11.437 --> 11:13.439
Go.

11:20.646 --> 11:23.449
Hi.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.475
Lost?

11:49.475 --> 11:52.278
No, I'm just,
uh, stretching my legs.

11:52.278 --> 11:55.481
Gabriel doesn't
like newcomers down here.

11:55.481 --> 11:58.684
Actually, I've known
Gabriel for quite a while.

11:58.684 --> 12:01.087
Really?

12:01.087 --> 12:05.891
Then let's you and
I have a talk with him.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.093
You know what?

12:07.093 --> 12:09.495
I have a better idea.

12:29.515 --> 12:31.117
What happened?

12:31.117 --> 12:33.519
I got a little carried away.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.121
Don't worry.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.523
She won't remember anything.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.525
You better hope not.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.127
I was born to power.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.129
Gabriel, you should be resting.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.931
Actually, I feel sensational.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.340
This is my future.

12:57.143 --> 13:01.147
This
bracelet belonged to an ancient
alchemist named Avaris --

13:01.147 --> 13:03.549
the woman I have holographically
reconstructed in all her glory.

13:15.561 --> 13:19.565
So she was beautiful
-- big deal.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.569
No, baby, it's
a lot more than that.

13:23.569 --> 13:26.372
I'm still waiting to
hear how any of this crap has

13:26.372 --> 13:29.575
anything to do
with saving your life.

13:29.575 --> 13:32.378
It has everything to do with it.

13:38.384 --> 13:44.390
Avaris, used her
own magic, to own her time.

13:44.790 --> 13:48.394
And once I've brought
her back to life, she'll use

13:48.394 --> 13:51.597
that same magic
to help me, own mine.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.448
You're talking about
primitives, people who

14:09.849 --> 14:15.855
believe in ghosts and
gods and human sacrifice.

14:17.456 --> 14:19.859
Sounds like mutants to me.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.076
Why
are you following me?

14:37.076 --> 14:38.677
Relax.

14:38.677 --> 14:41.080
He's a murdering psychopath.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.681
Look, I know how you feel.

14:42.681 --> 14:44.683
No, you don't.

14:47.486 --> 14:50.289
Hey, ladies.

14:50.289 --> 14:52.291
I could use a little company.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.492
Ooh.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.096
Come on, let's go.

14:57.496 --> 14:59.498
Let's get out of here.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.104
Ugh.

15:05.504 --> 15:09.909
Explain that to your wife.

15:10.309 --> 15:14.313
Now can we go?

15:14.713 --> 15:18.317
Now we can go.

16:00.359 --> 16:02.361
Could you
believe that cheese ball?

16:03.562 --> 16:05.564
Told you we'd get together again
before you knew it.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.170
How'd you get in here?

16:11.170 --> 16:13.973
Have you ever just wanted
to make someone so happy...

16:14.373 --> 16:17.576
and they just wouldn't let you?

16:17.576 --> 16:20.779
He's not real, Shal.

16:20.779 --> 16:23.182
She's crazy about me.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.584
We were made for each other.

16:25.584 --> 16:30.389
Like hell we were.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.590
That won't work.

16:31.991 --> 16:39.598
Not on you.

16:39.598 --> 16:40.799
Thanks.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.202
Come on.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.009
Aggh!

17:05.624 --> 17:08.027
Hey!

17:08.027 --> 17:10.029
I thought we agreed, no powers.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.230
No, you agreed.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.830
I scored. Heh heh.

17:12.830 --> 17:14.032
Sorry, game's over.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.634
Things are happening
at the Strand.

17:15.634 --> 17:16.835
But wait -- I'm up by one point.

17:16.835 --> 17:18.436
Believe me, I understand
how important that is,

17:18.837 --> 17:20.839
but Ashlocke's on the move.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.441
I've been using
satellite surveillance

17:22.441 --> 17:24.042
to keep an eye on the activity.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.045
One of his strike
teams is in Manhattan.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.047
You guys are going
to go check it out.

17:28.446 --> 17:29.648
Okay.

17:29.648 --> 17:32.051
Hey!

17:32.051 --> 17:33.252
Too slow.

17:33.252 --> 17:34.853
And now we're tied.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.256
Oh, great. You happy?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.666
If anyone gets
to these things first,

17:47.666 --> 17:49.268
Ashlocke will have our heads.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.328
Aren't you guys a little
old to be playing games?

18:49.328 --> 18:51.330
Agghhh!

20:08.607 --> 20:11.410
All that for a chunk of glass.

20:11.410 --> 20:12.611
Come on, wake up.

20:12.611 --> 20:15.013
Wake up.

20:18.450 --> 20:22.054
Look at me.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.056
What's Ashlocke up to?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.657
Do you really think
he tells me anything?

20:25.657 --> 20:28.460
Come on.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.062
Please, Gabriel.

20:30.462 --> 20:32.464
No.

20:32.464 --> 20:33.665
This isn't good.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.667
Come on, let's get out of here.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.070
Come on.

20:53.685 --> 20:57.289
Check it.

21:01.693 --> 21:02.494
Huh.

21:02.894 --> 21:04.896
Ashlocke was
ready to kill for this?

21:04.896 --> 21:08.100
Ashlocke is willing to kill
to get out of a parking ticket.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.102
He's out of his freaking mind.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.305
Yeah, must be
all that power, huh?

21:13.305 --> 21:14.906
The more you got,
the more you want, and the

21:14.906 --> 21:17.309
further you get from human.

21:17.709 --> 21:19.311
What are you trying to say?

21:19.311 --> 21:21.313
I'm just thinking.

21:21.313 --> 21:23.315
Every day we learn
more about these abilities.

21:23.715 --> 21:26.918
What? Are you trying
to tell me you think

21:26.918 --> 21:28.120
we're going to
end up like Ashlocke?

21:29.321 --> 21:31.323
No, that's exactly
what you're saying.

21:31.323 --> 21:34.126
Not what I'm saying.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.331
She seems to be stabilizing.

21:39.731 --> 21:42.534
Good.

21:42.534 --> 21:44.936
So what do you think
caused the seizure anyway?

21:45.337 --> 21:47.339
Ashlocke.

21:47.739 --> 21:49.341
Must have given her a...

21:49.341 --> 21:52.144
post-hypnotic suggestion.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.745
He probably programmed
her to self-destruct

21:53.745 --> 21:56.148
if she was ever captured.

22:00.552 --> 22:04.156
Valerie?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.757
Valerie?

22:05.757 --> 22:09.361
Hey, you all right?

22:12.964 --> 22:14.566
Valerie?

22:14.566 --> 22:16.168
Adam, do something.

22:19.371 --> 22:21.373
Valerie?

22:21.373 --> 22:23.775
Valerie.

22:32.984 --> 22:34.986
Adam...

22:34.986 --> 22:36.988
Adam.

22:41.393 --> 22:43.395
Did you get a read?

22:43.395 --> 22:45.797
Ashlocke's dying.

22:51.803 --> 22:54.206
Valerie died for me.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.208
But for what?

22:56.208 --> 22:59.811
A three- thousand-year-old piece
of glass that's a dead end.

22:59.811 --> 23:01.813
Without the other
half this is nothing more

23:01.813 --> 23:04.216
than a worthless trinket.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.218
This'll take the edge off.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.421
The last thing I
want is to kill the pain.

23:09.421 --> 23:17.028
That's the only thing
I have to keep me focused.

23:17.429 --> 23:20.232
That...

23:20.632 --> 23:23.034
that and the thought
of sharing that same agony

23:23.034 --> 23:25.036
with Adam, of course.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.443
Emma's resting.

23:31.443 --> 23:34.246
So you happy?

23:34.246 --> 23:35.447
You may get your wish.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.048
Ashlocke's dying.

23:37.449 --> 23:41.453
Good -- let him die.

23:41.453 --> 23:43.054
It's not that simple.

23:43.054 --> 23:45.857
Well, it seems pretty
straightforward to me.

23:45.857 --> 23:48.260
Stand back, he
dies -- end of story.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.461
It's that simple.

23:49.461 --> 23:52.664
It's not that simple.

23:52.664 --> 23:55.867
If he's dying, then
he's got nothing to lose.

23:55.867 --> 24:01.873
If
he's got nothing to lose, that
makes him even more dangerous.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.076
I'm listening.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.286
When I die,
one thing's for sure.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.288
Life is never again
going to be the same for those

24:16.688 --> 24:25.897
I leave behind, so you better
help me find that miracle.

24:25.897 --> 24:29.901
Well, I might have an idea.

24:29.901 --> 24:33.104
Really?

24:33.104 --> 24:38.710
Now you be a good boy,
and you go get some rest.

24:38.710 --> 24:44.716
I mean it.

24:47.519 --> 24:49.521
Okay, so this Ouija
board belonged to an ancient

24:49.521 --> 24:53.925
alchemist named
Avaris, whose burial urn
was owned by Neil Varadi.

24:53.925 --> 24:56.728
Well, that was until,
of course, Ashlocke stole it.

24:56.728 --> 24:58.330
So Ashlocke must believe
that he can save his life

24:58.730 --> 25:01.933
through
a translation of the formula
inscribed on the crystal.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.535
Yeah.

25:03.535 --> 25:04.736
Now wait -- check it out.

25:05.136 --> 25:06.338
But Ashlocke
may not know this --

25:06.338 --> 25:07.939
that there's
two crystals, though.

25:07.939 --> 25:09.140
Now, unless he
has them both and they're

25:09.140 --> 25:10.342
interlocked,
the piece that he has?

25:10.742 --> 25:13.545
Phtt. Worthless.

25:13.545 --> 25:15.947
And this is the map that'll
lead us to the other crystal.

25:15.947 --> 25:17.549
Yep.

25:17.549 --> 25:21.152
Hmm.

25:21.152 --> 25:23.955
Nice work.

25:29.961 --> 25:31.162
Adam?

25:31.162 --> 25:33.164
Dropped off Emma and
Shalimar at the pyramid.

25:33.565 --> 25:35.967
I'm running guard duty
until they've got the crystal.

25:35.967 --> 25:38.370
Well, keep your sensors on
full alert and your eyes open.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.772
Ashlocke makes a move,
it'll come out of nowhere.

25:40.772 --> 25:42.374
Still think I
ought to be down there.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.975
Phase in, phase out,
we'd be done with it.

25:43.975 --> 25:47.979
Yeah, well, I don't
give a damn what you think.

25:47.979 --> 25:49.180
Look out.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.182
Oh, gross.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.985
Disgusting.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.989
Are you feeling any better?

25:57.989 --> 26:00.792
Oh, just marvellous.

26:06.798 --> 26:09.200
Wait a minute.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.003
I think this is it.

26:50.041 --> 26:51.242
Let's get out of here.

26:51.643 --> 26:52.844
Jesse, we got it.

26:52.844 --> 26:55.246
No.

26:55.246 --> 26:57.248
That's mine.

26:57.649 --> 27:00.452
I don't think so.

27:06.858 --> 27:08.460
Sucks to be you.

27:21.373 --> 27:27.379
We're talking about
a very powerful magic here...

27:27.379 --> 27:31.383
If Ashlocke had gotten
his hands onto both of

27:31.383 --> 27:36.187
these crystals, we'd never
have been able to stop him.

27:36.588 --> 27:38.990
So what's your plan?

27:39.391 --> 27:41.793
Well, time to try it my way.

27:41.793 --> 27:45.797
Well, I hope it works...

27:45.797 --> 27:48.600
because if you're wrong,
Ashlocke's going to tear

27:48.600 --> 27:50.602
you limb from limb before
I get the chance to kill him.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.805
I know I'm putting
us all at risk here.

27:53.805 --> 27:58.610
But believe me, the decision
to try to save his life...

27:58.610 --> 28:02.213
is the most difficult
choice I've ever had to make.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.219
What's the point?

28:08.620 --> 28:14.225
Without the other half,
this thing is worthless.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.628
And there's
no way we can regenerate

28:16.628 --> 28:18.630
Avaris in the
time that I have left.

28:19.030 --> 28:22.634
I promised you I'd go to
any length, to save your life.

28:23.034 --> 28:29.441
So, I've adjusted Avaris's DNA.

28:29.441 --> 28:33.845
I've reconfigured
it, slightly, just enough to

28:33.845 --> 28:38.249
allow it to accept
genetic matter not her own.

28:38.249 --> 28:41.853
So we can completely
regenerate her

28:42.253 --> 28:43.855
without any more of her own DNA.

28:44.255 --> 28:46.257
And it's not a perfect solution.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.461
She'll only live for
a couple of weeks, but...

28:49.461 --> 28:53.064
Long enough for
her to work her magic.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.666
Save my life.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.668
Absolutely.

29:14.285 --> 29:19.891
All we have to do is introduce
a human host into the tank.

29:19.891 --> 29:22.694
The adjustments I've
made will do the rest.

29:46.718 --> 29:49.521
Thank you.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.523
I'll never forget
your sacrifice.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.325
Sacrifice?

29:54.325 --> 29:55.927
Oh, yeah.

29:55.927 --> 29:57.529
Sacrifice.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.531
Who gave you the right
to tamper with Avaris?

29:59.531 --> 30:01.533
I saved your life, damn it.

30:01.933 --> 30:03.535
That's right.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.537
And I'll never forget you.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.539
Gabriel.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.941
Gabriel, please.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.144
You went behind my back.

30:13.545 --> 30:19.551
And let's
face it, in any relationship
trust is everything.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.152
Gabriel.

30:21.152 --> 30:22.754
Gabriel?

30:22.754 --> 30:24.355
No.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.643
So what if he
does access her magic?

31:51.643 --> 31:52.844
Well, yeah, exactly.

31:52.844 --> 31:54.445
What do we do then?

31:54.445 --> 31:57.248
Look, I grew up in
a house where magic was a lot

31:57.248 --> 31:59.250
more real than physics.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.653
You know, my mom always
talked about spells having

32:01.653 --> 32:04.856
their opposites, incantations
that would turn the

32:04.856 --> 32:07.258
power against the user.

32:07.659 --> 32:12.063
Huh.

32:12.463 --> 32:15.667
Well, look, my skills
in the dark arts leave a

32:15.667 --> 32:18.469
little to be desired,
but I'm guessing that it's a

32:18.870 --> 32:20.872
little bit like science,
where every action has a

32:20.872 --> 32:26.878
reaction, where there are equal
but opposite opposing forces.

32:28.079 --> 32:30.481
are you saying that
if we could somehow find this

32:30.481 --> 32:34.485
other crystal,
that we could use it to turn
their power against them?

32:34.485 --> 32:38.489
It's worth a try.

33:16.527 --> 33:18.930
Says she's all right.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.332
But I don't know.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.334
You want to tell her that?

33:23.334 --> 33:24.936
Yeah, well, let's
just keep an eye on her.

33:24.936 --> 33:27.338
Because her okay and
my okay are a little different.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.741
You talking about me?

33:29.741 --> 33:31.342
Relax.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.344
I still think this
mission is a disaster,

33:33.344 --> 33:35.346
but I did sign
on for the long haul.

33:35.747 --> 33:36.547
All right.

33:36.547 --> 33:37.749
So we're all agreed?

33:37.749 --> 33:40.151
We go in, we finish the job.

33:40.151 --> 33:41.352
Thanks.

33:41.352 --> 33:42.954
Hey.

33:42.954 --> 33:44.555
Sorry I snapped at you.

33:44.555 --> 33:46.958
It's all right.

33:46.958 --> 33:47.759
You set?

33:48.159 --> 33:48.960
Ready.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.362
Let's go.

34:21.391 --> 34:24.195
You've made yourself
into a goddess.

34:24.594 --> 34:30.601
First, you get my crystals,
and then I'll save your life.

34:30.601 --> 34:33.404
I'll save your
life -- right here.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.607
And right now.

34:42.612 --> 34:45.416
You come in to my house...

34:45.416 --> 34:47.418
and try to kill me?

34:47.418 --> 34:51.822
I'm trying to save your life.

34:51.822 --> 34:53.824
This one's mine.

35:01.699 --> 35:04.902
Who the hell do you
think you're dealing with?

35:04.902 --> 35:07.705
That ten-year-old boy
you used to slap into a box?

35:13.711 --> 35:15.713
I'm trying to help you.

35:15.713 --> 35:18.516
Like you helped me before, Adam?

35:18.516 --> 35:22.120
Right into a
twenty-five year coma?

35:22.120 --> 35:26.124
All right, fine.

35:26.124 --> 35:31.329
Don't say I didn't try.

35:31.329 --> 35:34.532
I've waited years for this.

35:34.532 --> 35:37.335
I only wished I had
the time to make you suffer

35:37.735 --> 35:42.540
for as long as I have.

35:57.755 --> 35:58.556
You okay?

35:58.556 --> 36:01.359
Yeah. Go.

36:10.968 --> 36:12.170
Want to run?

36:12.570 --> 36:14.972
Yeah.

36:15.373 --> 36:18.176
Let's go get your crystal.

36:23.781 --> 36:25.783
Things didn't quite
go according to plan, huh?

36:25.783 --> 36:27.785
Now it looks like we're going
to have to live with Plan B.

36:27.785 --> 36:29.387
Why don't you rub it in?

36:29.387 --> 36:32.590
Wouldn't dream of it.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.192
Great.

36:57.415 --> 36:59.016
Just in time.

37:03.421 --> 37:05.022
Get down!

37:05.423 --> 37:08.226
Huh!

37:22.240 --> 37:23.040
I thought this guy
was supposed to be sick.

37:31.849 --> 37:33.851
Anything I can do?

37:33.851 --> 37:36.254
Yeah, watch my back.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.062
Go!

37:49.467 --> 37:51.068
Look.

37:51.068 --> 37:53.070
Hieroglyphics.

38:09.487 --> 38:12.290
We couldn't stop them.

39:01.138 --> 39:03.140
No! You have no right!

39:31.168 --> 39:33.170
We gotta get out of here!

39:33.170 --> 39:35.172
Come on!

39:55.593 --> 39:56.794
Got a minute?

39:57.194 --> 39:59.997
Always.

39:59.997 --> 40:02.400
I, uh, just wanted
to say that I'm sorry for

40:02.400 --> 40:04.802
getting in your
face about Ashlocke.

40:04.802 --> 40:09.607
Look, I know
asking you to help keep

40:09.607 --> 40:12.009
Ashlocke alive seems
crazy, particularly after

40:12.410 --> 40:14.412
what he's done to
you, but there's a lot I can

40:14.812 --> 40:16.814
learn from him.

40:17.214 --> 40:20.418
It's all about learning
with you, isn't it, Adam?

40:20.818 --> 40:23.621
It feels like Genomex all over.

40:24.021 --> 40:28.826
What I can learn from
him is how to keep you alive.

40:28.826 --> 40:32.830
Ashlocke's not the only
one with ongoing mutations.

40:32.830 --> 40:35.232
You've seen your powers change?

40:35.232 --> 40:40.037
Chances are
they'll change again.

40:40.037 --> 40:42.440
You saying we're going
to flame out like he is?

40:42.440 --> 40:43.641
You're not like him.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.444
All of you are more stable.

40:46.444 --> 40:50.848
So, um, do you think
he made it out of that

40:50.848 --> 40:54.051
building before it went up?

40:54.051 --> 40:56.854
Oh, you know
how tricky Ashlocke is.

40:56.854 --> 40:58.856
I won't believe he's
dead, until I see him lowered

40:58.856 --> 41:01.258
into the ground.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.870
Adam?

41:12.870 --> 41:17.675
Do
you think you can do something
to keep him out of my head?

41:18.075 --> 41:21.679
I mean, I can deal
with him wanting to kill me,

41:21.679 --> 41:24.882
but, man, when
he gets in there...

41:30.087 --> 41:32.890
Hey... hey you okay?

41:36.494 --> 41:38.095
Look at me.

41:38.095 --> 41:40.097
I'm acting like a little kid.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.699
I just never thought
that I'd meet anybody that

41:41.699 --> 41:43.300
can make me feel this weak.

41:43.300 --> 41:45.302
It's not weakness.

41:45.302 --> 41:47.705
The way he got to
you is through your soul.

41:48.105 --> 41:50.508
Anybody would feel this way.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.510
Okay?

41:57.715 --> 42:01.318
I think we have to
stop him before he gets his

42:01.318 --> 42:04.522
hooks into anybody else's soul.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.524
We will.
