00:15.933 --> 00:19.300
- Haha!
Gimme that Jonjerale.

00:19.367 --> 00:23.033

- Mmm.
Lime-a-licious!

00:25.667 --> 00:28.333
- And Bunny, here's
your shrimp cocktail.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.233
- Mmmmm, I hope these
shrimp like my stomach!

00:32.300 --> 00:34.467
- So what's this new game
idea you wanna show me?

00:34.533 --> 00:39.300
- Okay. The new game we've been
workin' on is called...

00:39.367 --> 00:42.333
- Psycho Beach Mummies.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.800
- Psycho Beach Mummies?

00:44.867 --> 00:47.167
- And now, we're gonna give
you guys a little

00:47.233 --> 00:49.067
live-action
demonstration.

- Let's get it on.

- Okay mummies!
Come out!

mummies are on the beach,

01:04.533 --> 01:06.167
zoomin' around
on hoverboards.

- Hey, can I get some
cocktail sauce for my shrimp?

01:11.433 --> 01:13.733
- Bunny, we are here to see
a game demonstration,

01:13.800 --> 01:16.533
not worry about you puttin'
sauce on your shrimp!

01:16.600 --> 01:18.833
- But I just want--
- Eat it dry!

01:18.900 --> 01:22.300
- But--
- Eat the shrimp dry.

01:24.833 --> 01:27.800
- Okay, now, in this game,
the mummies' goal is

01:27.867 --> 01:30.667
to grab the lifeguard
and eat his brains.

01:30.733 --> 01:33.133
- Uh-huh.
And where's this lifeguard?

01:33.200 --> 01:34.733
[ blows whistle ]

01:35.900 --> 01:38.433
- Lifeguard!

01:38.500 --> 01:41.133
- Attention.
This is your lifeguard.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.933
All mummies, off the beach!

01:44.067 --> 01:45.300
[ moaning ]

01:47.533 --> 01:50.500
- All right, mummies!
Try to get the lifeguard!

01:52.067 --> 01:54.900
- Stay away, mummies!

01:54.967 --> 01:56.233
Hey, mummies!

01:56.300 --> 01:59.633
Please do not eat
my large, juicy brain!

01:59.700 --> 02:01.700
- A-ha-ha! Get her brain!
- Get that brain!

02:01.767 --> 02:03.533
- Cut her off!
Eat her brain!

02:03.600 --> 02:04.700
- Let's go, mummies!

02:04.767 --> 02:06.933
- Stop rooting for
the mummies!

02:07.067 --> 02:08.567
- Oh.

02:08.633 --> 02:10.700
- Now, when the mummies
get close,

02:10.767 --> 02:14.067
you can use power-ups
to stop 'em, like

02:14.067 --> 02:15.233
anti-mummy gas!

02:15.300 --> 02:17.933
- Hey mummies!
Kiss my gas!

02:21.467 --> 02:23.533

other powerups, too,

Boost Juice.

not supposed to happen.

- Could someone please
help me down?

02:50.300 --> 02:51.667
- Hudson, go help Kenzie down.

02:51.733 --> 02:55.533
- On it.
Hold my bikini top.

02:58.067 --> 03:00.233
- Well that's the basic
idea of the game.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.633
Whaddaya think?

03:01.700 --> 03:02.933
- I love it!

03:03.067 --> 03:04.633
- Bunny, what'd you
think of the game?

03:04.700 --> 03:06.533
- I just don't understand
why you'd serve shrimp

03:06.600 --> 03:08.633
without cocktail sauce.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.667
- Bunny!

03:18.300 --> 03:20.933
- Okay, comin' up
the metal stairs.

03:21.067 --> 03:24.533
- It's called a ladder.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.833
- So, uh, how do you guys
like my beach mummy outfit?

03:27.900 --> 03:30.100
- It's not
historically accurate.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.300
- Mummies don't wear bikinis!

03:32.367 --> 03:34.233
- What? Since when did you
two become experts

03:34.300 --> 03:35.767
on what mummies look like?

03:35.833 --> 03:38.300
- Oh, Ruthless and I went
and saw that mummy exhibit

03:38.367 --> 03:39.700
at the Museum of History.

03:39.767 --> 03:41.900
- What exhibit?
- King Fuhd.

03:41.967 --> 03:45.067
- Yeah. He's over
three thousand years old.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.067
That's old.

03:47.133 --> 03:49.167
- Old as Fuhd.

03:49.233 --> 03:51.400
- Hey, we should
go see the mummy exhibit

03:51.467 --> 03:52.767
to get more ideas
for the game.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.367
- Or we could stay here,
make root beer floats

03:55.433 --> 03:58.100
and look up mummies online.

03:58.167 --> 04:01.133
- Whoa!

04:01.200 --> 04:03.667
- Ah, Hudson!

04:05.233 --> 04:09.467
- Uh, I feel like I've
become part of the problem.

04:14.533 --> 04:16.967
- This is humiliating.

* Only bosses up in here,
homie, that's what's up *

04:44.233 --> 04:48.167
* So, DJ, bounce that bass
so I can drop that what? *

04:48.233 --> 04:49.933
* Drop that

04:50.067 --> 04:51.133
* Let the bass hit low

* And make the whole club go

get enough when you *

- Yeah!
- Holy Fuhd.

05:17.433 --> 05:19.767
- Now, according to history,

05:19.833 --> 05:22.667
the young Prince Fuhd became
the new king of the Fuhdites,

05:22.733 --> 05:24.833
when his father, King Hummus,

05:24.900 --> 05:27.200
was trampled to death
by his own camels,

05:27.267 --> 05:30.267
who then ate
his royal remains.

Man, I would not wanna die
bein' trampled by camels.

sometime around 1500 B.C.

06:00.067 --> 06:02.167
- So, before corn?

06:03.667 --> 06:05.867
- B.C. does not mean
"before corn".

- Ooh! I love corn.
Mmm.

06:08.867 --> 06:11.900

one yellow vegetable.

Look at his crispy
little fingers.

they're mummified.

- See, mummies have no
moisture in their bodies,

06:43.333 --> 06:44.733
they're all dried out.

like human beef jerky?

are chasing the lifeguard,

into a camel.

10:55.733 --> 10:57.767
- L'chaim.

11:07.900 --> 11:11.100
- Trip, touching a mummy's
finger won't give you a curse.

11:11.167 --> 11:13.700
- Have you ever been touched
by a mummy's finger?

11:13.767 --> 11:15.067
- Well, no--

11:15.133 --> 11:17.567
- Then you don't
know, do ya?

11:17.633 --> 11:18.800
- Okay, this is good news.

11:18.867 --> 11:20.067
- What?
- What is it?

11:20.067 --> 11:21.333
- News?

11:21.400 --> 11:23.167
- There's nothing online
about the finger missing

11:23.233 --> 11:24.633
from the museum, that means
nobody's noticed it's gone yet.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.067
- Good.

11:26.133 --> 11:28.733
Hudson, take that nasty
old finger up on the roof

11:28.800 --> 11:30.567
and burn it!
- 'Kay!

11:30.633 --> 11:32.600
- No!
- Are you guys insane?

11:32.667 --> 11:34.067
- Give me the finger!

11:36.667 --> 11:40.267
This finger is an extremely
important part of world history!

11:40.333 --> 11:42.600
- Don't touch it,
you'll be cursed!

11:42.667 --> 11:47.167
- I will not.
See, look.

11:47.233 --> 11:51.333
- Ah, she did it!
Why'd ya do it?

11:51.400 --> 11:53.333
- Wow...

11:53.400 --> 11:55.133
I mean, wow.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.633
- What?

11:56.700 --> 11:58.667
- I just can't believe
we're standing here,

11:58.733 --> 12:00.867
holding a piece of
a human being who walked

12:00.933 --> 12:03.267
the earth over
3000 years ago.

12:03.333 --> 12:06.900
- Yeah. Think of all the places
that finger's been.

12:09.067 --> 12:11.500
- I know. This might have
touched the ancient waters

12:11.567 --> 12:12.900
of the Nile River.

12:12.967 --> 12:16.267
- Or picked
King Fuhd's nose.

12:16.333 --> 12:19.467
- Or tickled a dinosaur.

12:19.533 --> 12:22.100
- Or have been broken off
by a modern-day idiot

12:22.167 --> 12:24.200
from New York
who is now cursed!

12:24.267 --> 12:27.367
- Okay, Trip, you want me
to prove to you

12:27.433 --> 12:28.600
that being touched
by this finger

12:28.667 --> 12:30.067
doesn't make you cursed?

12:30.133 --> 12:33.167
- How are you gonna prove that?

12:33.233 --> 12:35.367
[ screams ]

12:35.433 --> 12:37.333
- You've just killed me!

12:39.233 --> 12:40.333
[ spits ]

12:41.600 --> 12:42.800
- You're not cursed!

12:42.867 --> 12:44.533
- You don't know that!

12:44.600 --> 12:48.400
- I do. I promise you, there's
no such thing as curses.

12:48.467 --> 12:52.200
- It's just a finger.
It can't hurt you.

12:53.367 --> 12:54.900
[ gasping ]

12:57.333 --> 12:58.767
[ groans ]

13:01.633 --> 13:03.567
- Okay, you keep that
finger away from me.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.133
- Ow... ow...

13:10.200 --> 13:13.400
Ow, ow...

13:13.467 --> 13:16.067
I think I cracked
my brain.

13:16.067 --> 13:18.233
- Here, put this
on your head.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.967
- Ah thanks-- Owww!

13:21.067 --> 13:22.967
That was not gentle!

13:23.067 --> 13:24.900
- Oh, you're such a baby.

13:24.967 --> 13:26.500
- No, I'm cursed!

13:26.567 --> 13:29.500
'Cuz you rubbed that old nasty
mummy finger on my face

13:29.567 --> 13:33.333
which is why that
monitor fell on my head.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.567
- I can't believe we have
King Fuhd's finger.

13:36.667 --> 13:37.700
[ sniffs ]

13:37.767 --> 13:39.067
Ugh.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.433
Oh, man, I wish
I hadn't sniffed that.

13:41.367 --> 13:42.600
- Hey, where's Hudson?

13:42.667 --> 13:45.100
- I sent him to buy some glue.
- For what?

13:45.167 --> 13:47.633
- So tomorrow, we can go back
to the museum and re-attach

13:47.700 --> 13:50.700
King Fuhd's finger to his
poor old wrinkled hand.

13:52.267 --> 13:54.100
- Walkin' in.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.200
- Oh, did you
get some glue?

13:55.267 --> 13:59.167
- Yep, one tube
of Taxi Glue.

13:59.233 --> 14:01.467
- Aww, man, nobody uses
Taxi Glue anymore.

14:01.533 --> 14:04.667
It's old
and it smells bad.

14:04.733 --> 14:06.200
Ooh!
Order some Tüber Glue.

14:06.267 --> 14:07.967
- Ooh! Right.

14:08.067 --> 14:09.700
- What's Tüber Glue?

14:09.767 --> 14:11.800
- Oh, it's this awesome
new glue service.

14:11.867 --> 14:13.200
You use an app to get it.

14:13.267 --> 14:14.833
- Yeah, you just tap the app,

14:14.900 --> 14:18.133
and then some unemployed person
just shows up with your glue.

14:19.700 --> 14:22.633
Ooh, there's a glue guy
only two minutes away.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.067
- Wait, we can't just walk
into the museum tomorrow

14:25.100 --> 14:27.667
and start gluing that thing
back onto King Fuhd's hand.

14:27.733 --> 14:30.833
- She's right.
We're gonna need a distraction.

14:30.900 --> 14:32.933
- Ooh, I know!

14:33.067 --> 14:36.367
I'll start telling
King Fuhd a really good joke.

14:36.433 --> 14:39.733
And while he's "distracted"

14:39.800 --> 14:43.467
you guys can glue
the finger back on him.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.467
- We don't need to distract
the dead person!

14:51.133 --> 14:52.333
[ phone beeps ]

14:52.400 --> 14:56.233
- Oh, my Tüber Glue
has arrived.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.933
- Tüber Glue.

14:59.067 --> 15:01.433
- Right here.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.200
- Thanks.
- Gimme five stars.

15:04.267 --> 15:06.067
- All right!

15:06.067 --> 15:07.067
- Okay-okay,
we got the glue,

15:07.100 --> 15:08.567
we got the finger.

15:08.633 --> 15:11.367
- Now, all we need a good
distraction at the museum.

15:11.433 --> 15:13.833
So let's all start
thinking of ideas.

15:13.900 --> 15:16.100
- Uh. I got it.
- What?

15:16.167 --> 15:18.700
- Double G.
- What about Double G?

15:18.767 --> 15:23.200
- Uh, he's famous,
and he's a lunatic.

15:23.267 --> 15:25.700
He distracts people
wherever he goes.

15:25.767 --> 15:26.900
- Oh yeah.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.700
- Nuh-uh!

15:28.767 --> 15:31.367
We're not tellin' my dad about
any of this finger business.

15:31.433 --> 15:32.800
- Why not?
It wasn't your fault.

15:32.867 --> 15:34.667
- Yeah, but somehow
I'll get blamed

15:34.733 --> 15:36.233
and I don't wanna get
in trouble with him!

15:36.300 --> 15:37.867
- What's he gonna do?

15:37.933 --> 15:42.567
- Put rocks in my backpack.
Rub onions on my pillow.

15:42.633 --> 15:46.667
The man is very creative
with his punishments!

15:46.733 --> 15:48.600
- All right, look, all
we need is for Dub

15:48.667 --> 15:50.833
to come to the museum so
he can distract everybody.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.200
We don't have to tell him
why we want him there.

15:53.267 --> 15:55.867
- Ooh, what 'bout this?

15:55.933 --> 15:59.800
We sell saddles for dogs.

16:01.067 --> 16:02.300
Right?

16:02.367 --> 16:04.800
You just put the saddle
on your dog,

16:04.867 --> 16:08.333
and then little kids can ride
them wherever they want to go.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.267
- What do saddles and
dogs have to do

16:13.333 --> 16:15.700
with our current problem?

16:15.767 --> 16:18.367
- I just thought we were
lookin' for good ideas.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.633
- And there he is, class,

16:26.700 --> 16:30.333
King Fuhd, who lived over
three thousand years ago.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.667
He's most well-known as
the inventor of shampoo

16:32.733 --> 16:34.767
and he was the first
leader of the Fuhdites

16:34.833 --> 16:36.967
to dance while
wearing short pants.

16:37.067 --> 16:39.467
- Wow!
- Wow!

16:39.533 --> 16:41.067
- Where's Trip
with Double G?

16:41.100 --> 16:43.367
- I dunno. He was supposed
to be here ten minutes ago.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.567
- Hey guys.
- Hey.

16:46.633 --> 16:49.133
- Uh... Who's the kid?

16:49.200 --> 16:52.067
- This is Chris,
from Weehawken.

16:52.067 --> 16:57.200
Listen, Chris, if they made
saddles for dogs,

16:57.267 --> 17:00.200
wouldn't you wanna buy one,
put it on your dog,

17:00.267 --> 17:02.867
then ride him all around town?

17:02.933 --> 17:04.533
- I don't know.

17:04.600 --> 17:08.500
- See? This idea is gold.

17:08.567 --> 17:11.133
- We're not talking about
dog saddles right now!

17:11.200 --> 17:13.267
- Or ever.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.667
- I'm going back
to my teacher.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.667
- Hey, look look.

17:19.733 --> 17:21.467
- All right.
Here we go.

17:21.533 --> 17:23.533
Here we go, right this way.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.067
- See, Dub's here.
- Good.

17:27.100 --> 17:29.167
Now, as soon as everyone
runs over to meet him,

17:29.233 --> 17:32.367
we can glue this finger
back onto King Fuhd's hand,

17:32.433 --> 17:33.833
and then we can
get outta here.

17:35.767 --> 17:40.833
- Okay, Dad, welcome to
the King Fuhd exhibit.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.833
- Why'd you bring me
here to this museum?

17:42.900 --> 17:46.067
I don't care nothin'
about no King Fudge.

17:46.100 --> 17:51.133
- He's not King Fudge.
- It's Fuhd!

17:51.200 --> 17:53.833
- How come nobody's
paying attention to Dub?

17:53.900 --> 17:55.100
- I don't think people
realize it's him.

17:55.167 --> 17:56.533
- Well, how could they?

17:56.600 --> 17:59.067
He's wearing that stupid
hat and sunglasses.

17:59.133 --> 18:03.567
- Takin' time outta my busy day,
to see some dead fudgeman.

18:03.633 --> 18:05.600
- Just wait, Dub,
I think you're gonna get

18:05.667 --> 18:07.100
a big kick outta this.

18:07.167 --> 18:10.167
- Yeah. King Fuhd
looks a lot like you.

18:10.233 --> 18:13.500
- Look, there's no way some
3000-year-old

18:13.567 --> 18:16.633
little mummy man is
as pretty as Double G.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.067
I don't know why you
all brought me--

18:19.100 --> 18:24.133
Oh! Hello handsome.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.300
- This plan isn't working.

18:26.367 --> 18:28.100
Dub's not distracting anyone.

18:28.167 --> 18:31.200
- All right children,
I'm going to the restroom,

18:31.267 --> 18:32.667
and it could take a while.

18:32.733 --> 18:35.100
So, you all wait right here.

18:35.167 --> 18:38.167
- Okay!
- Go ahead.

18:38.233 --> 18:40.233
- Hudson, get the glue ready.
Where's the finger?

18:40.300 --> 18:42.533
- In my hand, but there's
still too many people around.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.267
- There won't be in a second.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.433
Hey kids, guess what?

18:47.500 --> 18:48.767
- What's up?
- What's up?

18:48.833 --> 18:51.500
- Who's your favorite
music star?

18:51.567 --> 18:53.200
- Taylor Swift!
- Katy Perry!

18:53.267 --> 18:56.800
- Michael Buble!

18:56.867 --> 18:59.200
- It's Double G!
You guys like Double G.

18:59.267 --> 19:01.533
- Oh yeah!
- He's awesome!

19:01.600 --> 19:03.200
- Okay, well...

19:03.267 --> 19:05.400
Double G is right over there,

19:05.467 --> 19:06.767
wearing the hat
and sunglasses.

19:06.833 --> 19:08.133
- For real?
- For real?

19:08.200 --> 19:09.367
- That's him?

19:09.433 --> 19:10.633
- And they say,
if you touch his nose,

19:10.700 --> 19:14.100
then he'll give you
a hundred bucks.

19:14.167 --> 19:15.800
[ shouting ]

19:23.833 --> 19:25.767
- What do we do?
- I dunno! They're just kids!

19:25.833 --> 19:27.633
- I guess we can yell at 'em!

19:27.700 --> 19:30.067
- Hey kids, quit that!
- Stop that!

19:30.133 --> 19:31.400
- Bad kids!

19:31.467 --> 19:34.367
- Oh my God,
that's Double G!

19:34.433 --> 19:35.533

19:35.600 --> 19:38.167
I gotta go get my camera.

19:38.233 --> 19:40.100
Stay right there!

19:41.567 --> 19:44.433
- Come on!
- Oh my G- Kids, move!

19:44.500 --> 19:45.967
- Now's our chance!

- Go, go!

19:47.500 --> 19:51.200
- Okay, gimme the Tüber Glue!
- Tüber Glue.

19:51.267 --> 19:52.833
- You okay?
Move, kids!

19:52.900 --> 19:54.633
- Children! Hey!
- Thank you!

- Oh! Get off of that man!

19:56.400 --> 19:57.667
[ screaming ]

19:57.733 --> 19:59.600
- Leave his nose alone!

- C'mon Kenz, we don't
have much time!

20:00.733 --> 20:02.067
- I'm sorry!

20:02.133 --> 20:04.667
I'm not that experienced
with finger gluing!

20:06.467 --> 20:07.533
- All of you children,
stop that!

20:07.600 --> 20:08.967
- Get your kids!

20:09.033 --> 20:11.600
- Okay! I'm gonna count
to three. One, two...

- There!
It's on, you did it!

to King Fuhd's wrist!

- Drive safe!

anyone's gonna complain

21:05.267 --> 21:07.067
that we broke his finger off.

21:15.067 --> 21:17.067
- ...and although the
King Fuhd mummy was violated

21:17.133 --> 21:20.267
and damaged far beyond repair,
the state of New York

21:20.333 --> 21:23.533
has decided not to press
charges against rap superstar,

21:23.600 --> 21:26.067
Double G, after he
formally apologized

21:26.133 --> 21:29.200
to the Museum of History,
and gave them a donation

21:29.267 --> 21:31.767
of twenty million dollars.

21:33.933 --> 21:37.067
- That's almost half the money
I made last month.

21:37.133 --> 21:38.633
- We're sorry.
- Sorry Dub.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.067
- Sorry Dad.
- We feel bad.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.400
- Yeah, I just hope
the next Game Shakers game

21:41.467 --> 21:43.333
makes a lotta cash.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.600
- And in other
big money news,

21:45.667 --> 21:47.067
an eight-year-old boy
from Weehawken became

21:47.100 --> 21:49.100
an instant millionaire
himself last night,

21:49.167 --> 21:52.067
when he appeared on
the popular TV show, Shark
Bank,

21:52.133 --> 21:54.967
and sold them his concept
for a new invention:

21:55.067 --> 21:59.533
Saddles for dogs,
that kids can ride.

22:00.700 --> 22:03.500
- Aw Man!

22:03.567 --> 22:05.700
I wish I'd thought of that.

22:18.533 --> 22:19.767
- Got one!

22:19.833 --> 22:21.967
- Get off my beach!

22:24.467 --> 22:26.100
Look out!
Got one!

22:26.167 --> 22:28.200
Take that.

22:31.900 --> 22:33.533
Get off my beach!

22:33.600 --> 22:35.167
[ oven dings ]

22:35.233 --> 22:36.467
Mmm!
