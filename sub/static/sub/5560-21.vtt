00:24.233 --> 00:27.685
(indistinct chatter)

00:32.191 --> 00:34.358
Good morning, Assistant Director Mayfair.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.943
It's nice to meet you.

00:35.945 --> 00:38.029
Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Weitz.

00:38.031 --> 00:40.531
My boss tells me great things about you.

00:40.533 --> 00:41.916
I'm sure she does.

00:41.918 --> 00:44.085
But why the hell are
you packing up my office?

00:44.087 --> 00:45.419
I'm running point on the Alexandra Harrison

00:45.421 --> 00:46.954
murder investigation.

00:46.956 --> 00:49.090
And why does the U.S. attorney's office

00:49.092 --> 00:51.375
care about a dead salesperson?

00:51.377 --> 00:53.044
It's an unusual situation.

00:53.046 --> 00:55.212
It's not often the sitting
head of the New York office

00:55.214 --> 00:57.715
of the FBI is material
witness to a brutal murder.

00:57.717 --> 00:59.216
I'm here to protect you.

00:59.218 --> 01:03.270
Make sure the entire
investigation stays above board.

01:03.272 --> 01:04.805
Is she okay?

01:04.807 --> 01:07.024
I'm not sure. She just got here.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.478
They're boxing up her office?

01:10.480 --> 01:13.147
That seems a little drastic.

01:13.149 --> 01:14.782
I'll catch you guys later.

01:15.952 --> 01:18.986
Are there... Is she a suspect?

01:18.988 --> 01:20.821
Good morning, Agent Zapata.

01:23.076 --> 01:25.126
Weitz. Right?

01:25.128 --> 01:27.294
- U.S. Attorney's office?
- Good memory.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.080
Have a good day.

01:33.419 --> 01:35.920
And this page grants you
sheer power of attorney

01:35.922 --> 01:37.505
when your father can
no longer make financial

01:37.507 --> 01:40.091
or healthcare decisions for himself.

01:48.818 --> 01:50.401
(pen scribbling)

01:57.493 --> 02:00.661
Sorry, something about this
just feels really final.

02:02.615 --> 02:03.698
We'll get through this.

02:09.372 --> 02:10.503
(grunting)

02:14.377 --> 02:16.177
Whoa!

02:16.179 --> 02:17.962
Okay, you're a Navy SEAL, we get it.

02:17.964 --> 02:19.346
Do you wanna do a set?

02:19.348 --> 02:21.098
Ugh, I feel like I just did one.

02:24.470 --> 02:25.686
(chuckling)

02:25.688 --> 02:27.221
Does all the staring drive you crazy?

02:27.223 --> 02:28.689
I've never known anything different.

02:28.691 --> 02:31.726
Right... good point.

02:31.728 --> 02:32.893
It's not like I can do anything about it.

02:32.895 --> 02:34.145
Not unless...

02:34.147 --> 02:35.529
turtlenecks come back into fashion.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.150
You know what?

02:40.987 --> 02:42.987
You could get 'em removed. I could?

02:42.989 --> 02:44.655
Sure. Why not?

02:44.657 --> 02:47.908
I mean, they're all
archived in the databases.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.744
Yeah, but you're always
finding new ones, right?

02:49.746 --> 02:52.496
You know, the invisible
ink and layered images.

02:52.498 --> 02:55.082
As an agent, of course, I
should tell you to keep them.

02:55.084 --> 02:56.584
As... my friend?

02:56.586 --> 02:59.503
As your friend...

02:59.505 --> 03:02.590
I would say... it's your body.

03:02.592 --> 03:04.058
You should do what you want.

03:08.014 --> 03:09.396
Take your time.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.232
I realize it's a complicated question.

03:13.603 --> 03:16.187
<i>If</i> I had to say,

03:16.189 --> 03:18.606
if their starting pitching holds up,

03:18.608 --> 03:20.357
I think the Pirates will
make it back to the playoffs.

03:20.359 --> 03:22.359
Oh, but that's a very big "if."

03:22.361 --> 03:23.778
I mean, their rotation's pretty thin.

03:23.780 --> 03:25.529
That's why I'm keeping my arm in shape.

03:25.531 --> 03:28.415
Never know when the front
office is gonna call.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.451
Well, look, as much I
love using your sessions

03:30.453 --> 03:32.536
to catch up on sports,

03:32.538 --> 03:33.954
I am open if you ever want to discuss

03:33.956 --> 03:35.289
something more substantial.

03:35.291 --> 03:38.876
Your relationship with
Jane, your home life.

03:42.048 --> 03:44.215
There is...

03:44.217 --> 03:46.550
something that I really
wanted to ask you, Doc.

03:46.552 --> 03:50.888
Do you think... anyone...

03:50.890 --> 03:52.556
is getting through the Cubs this year?

03:52.558 --> 03:55.109
(laughing)

03:58.648 --> 04:00.114
We need to talk.

04:04.821 --> 04:06.737
How do you know Matthew Weitz?

04:06.739 --> 04:09.406
Met at a cop bar a few months ago.

04:09.408 --> 04:12.243
Just that one time, and he remembered you?

04:12.245 --> 04:16.079
He hit on me, I blew him off.

04:16.082 --> 04:18.916
Guess I made an impression.

04:18.918 --> 04:20.166
Hey, hold the elevator.

04:20.168 --> 04:22.169
Excuse me, excuse me.

04:22.171 --> 04:23.838
Sarah...

04:23.840 --> 04:26.640
What's, uh... How have you been?

04:26.642 --> 04:27.842
Same.

04:27.844 --> 04:28.843
You were here to see Kurt?

04:28.845 --> 04:30.060
Mm-hmm.

04:32.348 --> 04:33.647
(metal clanking)

04:33.649 --> 04:35.983
What was that? Are we stopping?

04:35.985 --> 04:38.819
(man on PA) <i>This is a test of our
emergency preparedness system.</i>

04:38.821 --> 04:40.354
<i>Remain where you are.</i>

04:40.356 --> 04:42.606
<i>The building is on
temporary lockdown.</i>

04:42.608 --> 04:45.359
<i>This is a test of our
emergency preparedness system.</i>

04:45.361 --> 04:47.111
<i>Remain where you are.</i>

04:47.113 --> 04:48.946
<i>The building is on
temporary lockdown.</i>

04:48.948 --> 04:50.614
Did he just say lockdown?

04:50.616 --> 04:51.699
Is this a terrorist attack?

04:51.701 --> 04:53.450
No, it's just a drill.

04:53.452 --> 04:54.785
We just have the good fortune

04:54.787 --> 04:56.203
of being stuck in here for this one.

04:56.205 --> 04:59.006
Sorry, did you just say we're stuck?

04:59.008 --> 05:00.708
Okay, 'cause that's not
gonna be good for me,

05:00.710 --> 05:02.877
'cause I don't do well
in small, enclosed spaces.

05:02.879 --> 05:05.012
Or large, open spaces, for that matter.

05:05.014 --> 05:07.131
- For how long?
- Five, ten minutes, max.

05:07.133 --> 05:08.632
That's great.

05:08.634 --> 05:10.134
That's just great.

05:10.136 --> 05:11.719
If this is an emergency drill,

05:11.721 --> 05:13.721
shouldn't we be trying to evacuate?

05:13.723 --> 05:15.055
Only if there's a fire.

05:15.057 --> 05:17.308
Otherwise, the protocol
is shelter in place.

05:17.310 --> 05:19.476
(sighs) So every door is locked?

05:19.478 --> 05:22.313
And every hallway sealed
with steel barriers.

05:22.315 --> 05:24.865
Trust me, in a chemical
attack, that's a good thing.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.650
We're gonna be here for a while.

05:26.652 --> 05:29.203
Don't department heads usually
get notice of these drills?

05:30.239 --> 05:31.956
Apparently, not today.

05:33.910 --> 05:35.659
Come on...

05:35.661 --> 05:37.411
I got no bars.

05:38.664 --> 05:39.830
Huh.

05:41.050 --> 05:42.082
There's no reception.

05:42.084 --> 05:43.500
Is that part of the drill?

05:43.502 --> 05:44.969
No, it's not supposed to be.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.305
All right, then.

05:49.425 --> 05:51.342
(tablet beeping)

05:51.344 --> 05:52.343
What's wrong?

05:52.345 --> 05:54.345
I am locked out of the network.

05:54.347 --> 05:57.731
And look at this error message.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.183
"You are blocked access to the system.

05:59.185 --> 06:00.317
Try it later again."

06:01.520 --> 06:03.103
That doesn't sound so official.

06:03.105 --> 06:05.606
It's like a non-native speaker
wrote it quickly, right?

06:05.608 --> 06:07.691
This lockdown is a smokescreen.

06:07.693 --> 06:09.076
We're being hacked.

06:09.078 --> 06:10.744
Someone's attacking the FBI.

I can't tell.

06:30.453 --> 06:32.334

to get back to my lab.

Hey, do these drills
shut off the HVAC systems?

06:35.006 --> 06:37.006
Yeah. Why?

06:39.427 --> 06:41.343
I'm worried about Sarah.

06:41.345 --> 06:44.597
Just hope she got out of the building okay.

06:44.599 --> 06:46.849
How has Sarah been?

06:46.851 --> 06:49.935
She's okay, I guess.

06:49.937 --> 06:53.856
Your father's illness
must be stressful for her.

06:53.858 --> 06:55.324

06:58.029 --> 07:01.280
She'll be fine.

07:01.282 --> 07:04.416
It's...

07:04.418 --> 07:07.036
Sawyer I'm more worried about.

07:07.038 --> 07:09.121
He knows his grandfather's sick?

07:09.123 --> 07:10.372
It's hard not to.

07:10.374 --> 07:12.208
Poor kid, he's only ten years old.

07:12.210 --> 07:13.959
So...

07:13.961 --> 07:15.961
I'm not sure he really understands...

07:15.963 --> 07:17.763
what's about to happen.

07:17.765 --> 07:20.716
Well, at that age, kids are
bombarded by images of death,

07:20.718 --> 07:22.551
from the TV, video games,

07:22.553 --> 07:23.886
an insect on the sidewalk.

07:23.888 --> 07:25.771
He certainly understands what's going on.

07:25.773 --> 07:28.057
I'm not sure if that's a
good thing or a bad thing.

07:28.059 --> 07:29.391
Well, it isn't good or bad.

07:29.393 --> 07:31.060
It just is.

07:31.062 --> 07:32.561
The question is how he'll cope.

07:32.563 --> 07:34.230
After losing a loved one, some children

07:34.232 --> 07:35.898
experience intense guilt,

07:35.900 --> 07:39.151
some bottle their
emotions, others lash out.

07:39.153 --> 07:41.821
He's about the same age you
were when Taylor disappeared, no?

07:45.960 --> 07:47.459
Discovering you were
wrong about your father

07:47.461 --> 07:49.328
must have been difficult.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.746
How do you think that made you feel?

07:50.748 --> 07:52.631
I'm glad I found out.

07:52.633 --> 07:53.632
Before it was too late.

07:53.634 --> 07:55.668
Oh, I meant professionally.

07:55.670 --> 07:57.920
FBI agents rely on their intuition.

07:57.922 --> 07:59.805
It would only be natural
for this to cause you

07:59.807 --> 08:02.091
to question your instincts more broadly.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.313
- Uhh!
- Jane?

08:09.761 --> 08:12.985
I'd ask if everything's
okay, but it clearly isn't.

08:12.987 --> 08:14.687
What the hell is going on?

08:16.858 --> 08:18.391
That's not gonna make any difference.

08:19.861 --> 08:21.394
(Edgar) And neither will that.

08:25.867 --> 08:27.817
Hey... Sarah, I'm sorry.

08:27.819 --> 08:29.652
Not your fault we're stuck in an elevator.

08:29.654 --> 08:31.704
No, I...

08:31.706 --> 08:32.989
I mean about everything, I'm sorry...

08:32.991 --> 08:35.491
It's fine. We're good.

08:35.493 --> 08:37.159
I don't know. I figured I should just...

08:37.160 --> 08:41.380
Sorry, can we just, like,
wait this lockdown out, please?

08:41.381 --> 08:44.250
Hey, this is bad, this is... I need Valium.

08:44.251 --> 08:45.585
Do either of you guys have Valium?

08:45.587 --> 08:46.719
Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan?

08:46.721 --> 08:49.555
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I'm fresh out.

08:49.557 --> 08:52.058
God, I must have something in here.

08:52.060 --> 08:53.175
Come on, Kristin, pull yourself together,

08:53.177 --> 08:54.894
pull yourself together...

08:54.896 --> 08:57.096
- Kristin, I think I just heard you say?
- Yeah.

08:57.098 --> 08:58.681
- It's just a drill.
- Yeah.

08:58.683 --> 09:00.683
You know what else started as just a drill?

09:00.685 --> 09:01.851
No.

09:04.188 --> 09:07.189
Well, neither do I.

09:07.191 --> 09:09.609
Hey, I think you're, like,
overreacting a little bit.

09:09.611 --> 09:11.527
(rattling pills)

09:11.529 --> 09:13.746
Paxitrol. These guys'll do the trick.

09:13.748 --> 09:15.281
(Weller) If we're being hacked,

09:15.283 --> 09:18.200
we probably don't have
much time to stop them.

09:18.202 --> 09:19.869
Wait.

09:19.871 --> 09:22.705
There's only two doors
between this room and my lab.

09:22.707 --> 09:25.591
I can manually open these
doors by hotwiring the circuits.

09:25.593 --> 09:27.927
Here. Use this.

09:30.765 --> 09:32.214
(Weller grunting)

09:32.216 --> 09:35.768
Okay. Take this.

09:35.770 --> 09:37.637
This will just take a second.

09:39.607 --> 09:41.273
Heard about what happened last night.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.310
That's...

09:44.312 --> 09:45.611
I'm so sorry.

09:47.982 --> 09:50.566
Do you have any idea who it was?

09:50.568 --> 09:52.618
Or why your friend was killed?

09:52.620 --> 09:54.904
Someone's trying to send me a message.

09:54.906 --> 09:56.072
Who?

09:57.291 --> 09:59.492
I don't know yet.

09:59.494 --> 10:01.243
But the longer you stay in this job,

10:01.245 --> 10:02.795
the more enemies you make.

10:02.797 --> 10:04.747
Is Matthew Weitz one of those enemies?

10:04.749 --> 10:06.882
You'd have to ask him.

10:15.593 --> 10:18.427
(electricity zapping)

10:18.429 --> 10:19.478
Okay.

10:20.932 --> 10:22.098
Finally...

10:22.100 --> 10:24.266
- (door unlocking)
- Hey.

10:24.268 --> 10:25.685
That actually worked.

10:27.271 --> 10:28.771
- (Weller) Patterson.
- Give me this.

10:31.826 --> 10:33.609
(Patterson) All right, this
will only take a few minutes.

10:41.202 --> 10:42.251
It seemed faster.

10:47.291 --> 10:48.507
All right.

10:48.509 --> 10:49.842
Let me get into my system.

10:49.844 --> 10:51.544
Please, don't break any more windows.

10:51.546 --> 10:52.545
(Weller) Yes, ma'am.

10:52.547 --> 10:54.547
(Jane grunting)

10:54.549 --> 10:57.299
I didn't know that you saw Dr. Borden too.

10:57.301 --> 10:59.802
What? This was just a formality.

10:59.804 --> 11:02.855
Every agent has to do one
of those sessions quarterly.

11:02.857 --> 11:04.974
Hey, um...

11:04.976 --> 11:07.810
Are you questioning your
instincts now that I'm back?

11:07.812 --> 11:10.312
It's... I just... I overheard when I was...

11:10.314 --> 11:12.314
It's a typical shrink question.

11:12.316 --> 11:14.200
Okay.

11:14.202 --> 11:16.535
And don't tell anyone else this,

11:16.537 --> 11:19.739
but, contrary to popular beliefs,

11:19.741 --> 11:22.374
not all of my instincts
are right all the time.

11:23.911 --> 11:25.161
But I was right about you.

11:30.418 --> 11:31.834
Patterson, what do you got?

11:31.836 --> 11:34.336
Whoever's doing this is...

11:34.338 --> 11:36.338
Okay, wow, they got past
our outside firewall.

11:36.340 --> 11:38.174
They have root access.

11:38.176 --> 11:40.509
They're controlling the main
servers in the whole building.

11:40.511 --> 11:42.178
Can you stop them from here?

11:42.180 --> 11:45.181
They're adjusting my
read/write/execute permissions.

11:45.183 --> 11:47.349
I can only see what they're
doing, I can't block it.

11:47.351 --> 11:49.235
Any idea who they're targeting?

11:49.237 --> 11:51.687
There's two dozen federal
agencies inside this building.

11:51.689 --> 11:53.272
(beeping)

11:55.026 --> 11:56.358
They're targeting us.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.194
They're downloading the identities

11:58.196 --> 12:00.913
for every single undercover FBI agent.

12:00.915 --> 12:02.698
If that list gets out, that
would jeopardize the lives

12:02.700 --> 12:04.917
of hundreds of agents
and thousands of sources.

12:04.919 --> 12:06.786
(Patterson) Every ongoing
Bureau investigation

12:06.788 --> 12:08.754
would be compromised.

12:08.756 --> 12:11.068
They're trying to bring down the FBI.

12:16.064 --> 12:17.519
They'll have these cover identities

12:17.521 --> 12:19.908
downloaded in an hour, max.

12:19.910 --> 12:22.027
- Can we track the hacker's location?
- No.

12:22.029 --> 12:23.579
As long as I'm locked out,

12:23.581 --> 12:25.914
there's no way of routing their IP address.

12:25.916 --> 12:27.616
And even if I could,
they could be anywhere.

12:27.618 --> 12:30.703
An internet café in Shanghai,
an apartment in SoHo...

12:30.705 --> 12:32.921
(woman speaking Spanish)

12:33.043 --> 12:34.375
_

12:34.375 --> 12:35.457
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:35.879 --> 12:37.785
_

12:38.573 --> 12:40.457
_

12:40.459 --> 12:42.927
_

12:43.236 --> 12:45.585
_

12:46.674 --> 12:48.193
_

12:51.537 --> 12:52.764
_

12:53.495 --> 12:55.146
_

12:55.148 --> 12:56.562
_

12:56.564 --> 12:58.447
If we can't track their location,

12:58.449 --> 13:00.399
we have to find a way to
cut the connection from here.

13:00.401 --> 13:01.784
We could go analog.

13:01.786 --> 13:04.236
Disrupt the building's
telecommunication lines.

13:04.238 --> 13:05.621
But we'd have to get <i>physically</i>

13:05.623 --> 13:08.240
as close to those wires'
main point of entry.

13:08.242 --> 13:10.242
- Where is that?
- The main point of entry room.

13:10.244 --> 13:11.460
No, I mean, <i>where?</i>

13:11.462 --> 13:12.661
That's what it's called.

13:12.663 --> 13:14.296
The MPOE room, the main point of entry.

13:14.298 --> 13:15.581
All right, Abbot and Costello.

13:15.583 --> 13:17.082
I get it. How do we get there?

13:17.084 --> 13:18.801
First, we need a way to communicate.

13:18.803 --> 13:20.919
Our cell and radio signals are jammed,

13:20.921 --> 13:23.639
but I've been playing around
with these collectibles.

13:23.641 --> 13:26.258
Very rare. They're shortwave...

13:26.260 --> 13:28.977
so they should still work.

13:28.979 --> 13:30.596
Here.

13:30.598 --> 13:31.730
All right.

13:32.983 --> 13:34.767
These look like they belong in a museum.

13:34.769 --> 13:35.768
Thank you.

13:35.770 --> 13:37.603
I collect a lot of cool stuff.

13:37.605 --> 13:38.987
How do we get to the MPOE room?

13:38.989 --> 13:40.773
That's the hard part.

13:40.775 --> 13:42.107
It's on the other end of this floor,

13:42.109 --> 13:43.492
but because of the lockdown,

13:43.494 --> 13:45.027
all the halls are blocked
with steel barriers.

13:45.029 --> 13:46.445
Can't those barriers be hotwired?

13:46.447 --> 13:47.496
There's too many of them.

13:47.498 --> 13:49.615
I mean, that would take forever.

13:49.617 --> 13:51.867
- Unless...
- Unless what?

13:51.869 --> 13:53.452
Okay, okay.

13:53.454 --> 13:56.455
So the building systems
think we're in a drill,

13:56.457 --> 13:59.041
but if there was a <i>real</i> emergency,

13:59.043 --> 14:00.542
that would override the lockdown

14:00.544 --> 14:02.678
and initiate an evacuation protocol.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.179
All the doors would open.

14:04.181 --> 14:06.715
So you want to trick
the system into thinking

14:06.717 --> 14:07.883
there's an emergency?

14:07.885 --> 14:09.301
That's the extreme part.

14:09.303 --> 14:11.937
I can't access the system,
so I can't trick it.

14:13.357 --> 14:16.275
We need to start a giant fire.

14:18.863 --> 14:22.898
Calm... calm...

14:22.900 --> 14:24.233
The meds aren't kicking in yet.

14:24.235 --> 14:27.820
(Kristin) Calm, calm...

14:27.822 --> 14:29.488
So how's Sawyer's football team doing?

14:29.490 --> 14:32.157
You said he was nervous
about starting tackle league.

14:32.159 --> 14:33.659
Terrible.

14:33.661 --> 14:36.161
- Like, really awful.
- Oh, man.

14:36.163 --> 14:40.382
He's really cute in his
oversized helmet, though.

14:40.384 --> 14:41.750
Tell him to make sure he stays away

14:41.752 --> 14:44.419
from anybody with facial hair.

14:44.421 --> 14:47.840
There's always at least one
beast child running around

14:47.842 --> 14:49.758
with a goatee, hitting everybody.

14:52.229 --> 14:54.096
Sorry, can we not do this, please?

14:54.098 --> 14:55.230
Do what?

14:57.935 --> 15:01.186
Just, like, act like everything's okay?

15:01.188 --> 15:03.105
And act like you can ask me about my son

15:03.107 --> 15:04.857
and make jokes.

15:04.859 --> 15:06.358
Be my friend.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.944
'Cause you, like, really broke my heart.

15:11.866 --> 15:13.866
Wait a second.

15:13.868 --> 15:16.618
You two used to date and now
you're trapped in an elevator?

15:16.620 --> 15:18.086
This is exactly like that movie.

15:18.088 --> 15:20.372
The one with the elevator,
where they fall in love.

15:20.374 --> 15:22.090
With that girl and that guy from TV.

15:22.092 --> 15:23.959
You know what I'm talking
about, he's got, like, the, um...

15:23.961 --> 15:26.011
Like, the face, and the hands?
It really doesn't matter.

15:27.047 --> 15:28.714
I thought we were stuck in here

15:28.716 --> 15:31.216
because of karmic payback
for this hit-and-run,

15:31.218 --> 15:32.768
but it turns out, it's 'cause we're gonna

15:32.770 --> 15:34.469
get you two back together.

15:34.471 --> 15:35.521
(chuckling) Wow.

15:36.891 --> 15:38.891
Whew.

15:38.893 --> 15:41.276
Those anxiety meds just hit me hard.

15:41.278 --> 15:43.312
Hard.

15:43.314 --> 15:45.280
Hard...

15:45.282 --> 15:48.150
That is a funny word when you
say it over and over again.

15:48.152 --> 15:49.368
Hard.

15:50.571 --> 15:52.454
Hard...

15:55.492 --> 15:57.075
These drills never take this long.

15:57.077 --> 16:00.412
A few years ago, we had one
that lasted for two hours.

16:00.414 --> 16:01.713
These things can drag on.

16:08.422 --> 16:11.306
What is your goal here, Tasha?

16:11.308 --> 16:12.758
My goal?

16:12.760 --> 16:15.427
Where do you see yourself in ten years?

16:15.429 --> 16:17.346
We were all young and ambitious once.

16:17.348 --> 16:18.480
There's no shame in it.

16:20.267 --> 16:21.683
I guess, uh...

16:25.105 --> 16:27.823
I'd like to run a
division one day, like you.

16:29.193 --> 16:30.859
(chuckling)

16:30.861 --> 16:33.695
Be careful what you wish for.

16:35.699 --> 16:38.333
Early on in my career,

16:38.335 --> 16:42.120
someone powerful approached
me, asking for help.

16:43.123 --> 16:46.291
It was a big career opportunity.

16:46.293 --> 16:50.128
What he was asking me to do was...

16:50.130 --> 16:53.181
morally ambiguous at best.

16:53.183 --> 16:55.050
I went along.

16:55.052 --> 16:57.970
Told myself that it was
for the greater good,

16:57.972 --> 17:01.139
but in my gut, I knew that was a lie.

17:01.141 --> 17:02.941
Didn't sleep well back then.

17:04.194 --> 17:05.560
Still don't.

17:08.198 --> 17:10.983
Things went sideways
and that powerful person

17:10.984 --> 17:13.068
was nowhere to be found.

17:13.069 --> 17:16.204
I was left alone to account for my actions,

17:16.205 --> 17:19.124
wishing that I'd trusted my gut.

17:22.329 --> 17:25.079
Whatever you're doing with Weitz,

17:25.082 --> 17:26.498
<i>for</i> Weitz,

17:26.500 --> 17:30.252
just make sure you can sleep at night.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.506
I told you.

17:34.508 --> 17:36.308
We just met that one time.

17:38.345 --> 17:41.013
♪♪

17:56.914 --> 17:58.196
<i>it's only temporary.</i>

17:59.867 --> 18:01.366
Then what happens?

18:01.368 --> 18:03.785
Then the floor fills with carbon dioxide,

18:03.787 --> 18:05.587
the fire goes out, the doors close again

18:05.589 --> 18:07.539
and you'll be trapped wherever you are.

18:07.541 --> 18:09.374
What, so you're saying move quickly?

18:09.376 --> 18:11.710
<i>Yes, I'm saying move very quickly.</i>

18:11.712 --> 18:13.128
All right. Let's get these.

18:18.802 --> 18:20.719
- What?
- Nothing.

18:20.721 --> 18:22.554
When you were a kid,
you were kind of a pyro.

18:22.556 --> 18:23.939
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:23.941 --> 18:26.391
What did I set fire to?

18:26.393 --> 18:27.809
Everything.

18:27.811 --> 18:29.061
We went camping.

18:29.063 --> 18:31.146
This spot had all these little plots.

18:31.148 --> 18:34.483
They had cheesy western
names like Monument Valley

18:34.485 --> 18:36.401
and Little Big Horn.

18:36.403 --> 18:37.736
You remember any of that?

18:37.738 --> 18:38.737
(stammering)

18:38.739 --> 18:40.238
Anyway.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.741
You used to poke your stick in the fire,

18:42.743 --> 18:44.659
run around that site like a pyromaniac

18:44.661 --> 18:46.128
setting fire to everything.

18:46.130 --> 18:47.829
Wow, I was a menace.

18:47.831 --> 18:49.464
You were.

18:49.466 --> 18:51.249
Now...

18:51.251 --> 18:53.502
Let's see if you still got it.

18:53.504 --> 18:55.003
Light it up.

18:55.005 --> 18:56.388
Here goes.

19:00.928 --> 19:02.094
Huh.

19:05.099 --> 19:06.431
Are you sure this is gonna work?

19:06.433 --> 19:08.066
Oh, no, not at all.

19:09.019 --> 19:10.018
(Weller) <i>Uh, Patterson.</i>

19:10.020 --> 19:11.603
<i>It's not working.</i>

19:11.605 --> 19:16.024
Okay, I guess the sensors
aren't as reactive as...

19:16.026 --> 19:17.275
We need a bigger fire.

19:17.277 --> 19:19.111
This one's already pretty big.

19:19.113 --> 19:20.362
Take it up with the sensors.

Run! Run!

19:41.802 --> 19:43.635
(door crashes)

19:43.637 --> 19:46.054
We're in. Now what?

19:46.056 --> 19:48.640
Okay, those wire bundles
control the communication

19:48.642 --> 19:50.642
going in and out of the building.

19:50.644 --> 19:52.477
Phone, cable, Internet.

19:52.479 --> 19:54.196
(Jane) Okay, how do we
know which ones to disable?

19:54.198 --> 19:55.897
You don't. Just cut 'em all.

19:57.651 --> 19:59.317
Let's get started.

20:07.828 --> 20:09.244
Okay, done!

20:09.246 --> 20:10.962
Okay, that should do it!

20:13.000 --> 20:14.499
Are you sure?

20:14.501 --> 20:16.334
There aren't any lines you missed?

20:16.336 --> 20:18.053
(Weller) Positive, why?

20:18.055 --> 20:20.005
The hackers are still
downloading that file.

20:20.007 --> 20:21.339
What?

20:21.341 --> 20:22.841
But without these lines,
no one should be able

20:22.843 --> 20:24.759
to access the building
from the outside, right?

20:26.396 --> 20:28.680
Unless...

20:28.682 --> 20:30.482
They've been inside the
building this whole time.

20:49.453 --> 20:50.702
All right.

20:50.704 --> 20:52.204
Patterson, I've opened this box.

20:52.206 --> 20:54.005
How do I hotwire this door?

20:54.007 --> 20:56.041
It's kinda intricate, but I'll
try to talk you through it.

20:56.043 --> 20:57.292
- Okay.
- (steam hissing)

20:57.294 --> 20:58.844
Well, you better hurry!

<i>The hackers know
that we're onto them!</i>

21:00.347 --> 21:02.931

21:02.933 --> 21:04.233
- Oh, no.
- What?

21:04.235 --> 21:06.442
They only have about a
minute of breathable air left.

21:13.112 --> 21:16.009
Patterson! Talk me
through opening this door!

21:16.011 --> 21:17.377
Stop talking.

21:17.379 --> 21:19.012
Every word you say will eat up oxygen.

21:19.014 --> 21:20.380
Start by finding the red wire.

21:20.382 --> 21:22.216
You wanna be a little more specific?!

21:22.218 --> 21:23.634
Thick red wire with a blue stripe.

21:23.636 --> 21:25.686
- <i>Got it!</i>
- Don't speak.

21:25.688 --> 21:28.689

green wires, grab those.

21:28.691 --> 21:29.940
One will feel hot, cut that one.

21:29.942 --> 21:31.358
There are three orange wires.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.143
Take the second one from the top.

21:33.145 --> 21:34.394
Link it with the bottom one
and then take that bottom one...

21:34.396 --> 21:36.363
No, no! Don't touch the purple ones.

21:36.365 --> 21:37.481
The purple one needs to stay where it is.

21:37.483 --> 21:39.316
Okay. Last step.

21:39.318 --> 21:42.236
Touch the B grouping of wires
to the primary power regulator.

21:44.073 --> 21:45.572
That should have opened the door, right?

21:45.574 --> 21:47.241
Weller?

21:47.243 --> 21:48.458
Jane.

21:50.796 --> 21:51.962
<i>(coughing)</i>

21:51.964 --> 21:53.630
(Weller) <i>We're out!</i>

21:53.632 --> 21:54.748
The hackers know we're onto them.

21:54.750 --> 21:55.832
They're gonna try to bolt.

21:55.834 --> 21:57.334
We can't let them leave.

21:57.336 --> 21:59.636
I'm sure they've already
got a list of buyers set up.

21:59.638 --> 22:02.005
They get out of this
building, it's all over.

22:02.007 --> 22:03.840
Okay, so how do we find them?

22:03.842 --> 22:06.176
This is a 70-floor building,
they could be anywhere.

22:06.178 --> 22:07.895
If it were me, I would set up

22:07.897 --> 22:09.730
where there was physical network access.

22:09.732 --> 22:11.064
I would plug directly into

22:11.066 --> 22:12.266
the building's main server room.

22:12.268 --> 22:14.067
- No, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

22:14.069 --> 22:15.852
We don't know how many
people we're dealing with.

22:15.854 --> 22:17.154
If we're gonna take them down,
we need to get our weapons.

22:17.156 --> 22:18.572
You don't have time.

22:18.574 --> 22:20.107
You're way too far from the locker-room.

22:20.109 --> 22:22.526
Patterson, we're near the
evidence room, aren't we?

22:22.528 --> 22:25.028
(Patterson) <i>Yeah, you should
be right underneath it.</i>

22:26.749 --> 22:28.415
You up for a climb?

22:28.417 --> 22:31.034
(grunting) Almost there.

22:31.036 --> 22:34.254
(grunting)

22:36.926 --> 22:38.675
It was a...

22:38.677 --> 22:41.795
a lot easier going down.

22:41.797 --> 22:43.130
Do you need a break?

22:43.132 --> 22:46.099
No. Why? Do you?

22:46.101 --> 22:47.434
(panting)

22:47.436 --> 22:48.635
Of course not.

22:53.525 --> 22:56.276
You're right.

22:56.278 --> 22:58.061
I lied about how I knew Weitz.

22:58.063 --> 23:00.530
He approached me about helping
him with an investigation.

23:00.532 --> 23:02.316
Investigation of what?

23:02.318 --> 23:06.536
In his words, corruption in the Bureau.

23:06.538 --> 23:09.957
He thinks you're dirty.

23:09.959 --> 23:11.291
And you believed him?

23:15.664 --> 23:17.798
I guess that answers my question.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.500
It's not that I think he's right.

23:20.502 --> 23:23.337
But I haven't heard convincing
evidence that he's wrong.

23:23.339 --> 23:26.923
I'm sorry, but I wasn't
aware that part of my job

23:26.925 --> 23:30.344
was proving to subordinates
that I'm not a criminal.

23:30.346 --> 23:34.014
You have to admit, you have been acting...

23:34.016 --> 23:37.017
I don't know, just... secretive!

23:37.019 --> 23:38.902
Especially since Jane arrived.

23:38.904 --> 23:40.354
- For example?
- For example,

23:40.356 --> 23:42.072
not telling us that one
of your case file numbers

23:42.074 --> 23:43.490
was tattooed on Jane's body.

23:43.492 --> 23:45.075
We caught Guerrero!

23:45.077 --> 23:46.576
But we could have caught him sooner,

23:46.578 --> 23:48.996
gotten headway into who
tattooed that case on Jane.

23:51.784 --> 23:54.034
Then there were all those
secret meetings with Carter,

23:54.036 --> 23:55.952
right up until his disappearance.

23:55.954 --> 23:57.504
Hang on.

23:57.506 --> 24:00.674
What exactly is Weitz accusing me of?

24:00.676 --> 24:04.344
He didn't say, but he
did point out this pattern

24:04.346 --> 24:07.431
of people around you ending up dead.

24:07.433 --> 24:11.301
Your friend last night and
Carter and Guerrero and...

24:11.303 --> 24:12.436
Go on.

24:12.438 --> 24:14.638
Go on, say it!

24:14.640 --> 24:16.523
Sofia Varma.

24:16.525 --> 24:18.308
Something is going on here.

24:18.310 --> 24:19.643
I don't know what it is,

24:19.645 --> 24:22.646
and I don't know if Weitz does, either.

24:22.648 --> 24:26.817
But he is going to find it,
whether I help him or not.

24:28.904 --> 24:33.407
And if you had doubts,
why didn't you come to me?

24:33.409 --> 24:36.376
How do you think that
conversation would have gone?

24:36.378 --> 24:38.161
Okay.

24:39.665 --> 24:43.750
How am I gonna continue
having you on my team

24:43.752 --> 24:45.802
when you don't trust me as a leader?

24:51.760 --> 24:53.560
Quiet your mind.

24:56.148 --> 24:58.014
I know you don't want
to talk about it, Sarah,

24:58.016 --> 25:00.016
- but...
- Look...

25:00.018 --> 25:02.352
I thought you were different,

25:02.354 --> 25:04.104
but you're just like my brother.

25:04.106 --> 25:06.239
You have no idea how to let people in.

25:06.241 --> 25:08.358
So thank you, genuinely.

25:08.360 --> 25:10.744
Thank you for ending it before I...

25:10.746 --> 25:12.529
introduced you to my son.

25:14.917 --> 25:17.417
♪♪

25:24.209 --> 25:25.842
I think we came to the right place.

25:31.800 --> 25:32.849
(gun clicks)

25:37.639 --> 25:39.022
A little overkill.

25:39.024 --> 25:40.474
It's better to have ten
guns and only need one

25:40.476 --> 25:41.641
than the other way around.

25:44.062 --> 25:46.363
How're we gonna get
through the barrier doors?

25:46.365 --> 25:47.781
Ah, that's a good question.

That'll work.

25:56.875 --> 25:59.793
(electricity sizzling)

26:09.555 --> 26:12.139
More backup! I was hoping
we'd run into some more agents.

26:12.141 --> 26:13.306
What's going on?

26:13.308 --> 26:14.841
We got hacked.

Okay.

She's down.

28:04.586 --> 28:05.919
She's gone.

28:11.843 --> 28:13.543
Our suspect's down.

28:13.545 --> 28:14.628
Where's Morales?

28:15.847 --> 28:17.097
Ohh.

28:17.099 --> 28:18.098
The other suspect?

28:18.100 --> 28:19.382
Got away.

28:21.103 --> 28:23.887
This should bypass the lockdown,
get me basic system access.

28:23.889 --> 28:26.439
Here. I found this on
the hacker we took down.

28:26.441 --> 28:28.475
Nicole Serrano, custodial staff.

28:28.477 --> 28:31.811
Pretty sophisticated
skill set for a janitor.

28:31.813 --> 28:33.530
Can you bring up the
rest of that department?

28:33.532 --> 28:34.564
Yeah.

28:37.486 --> 28:38.535
There.

28:38.537 --> 28:39.619
That's him.

28:39.621 --> 28:41.738
Okay. Carlos Wanzer.

28:41.740 --> 28:45.375
Looks like they started
the same day last August.

28:45.377 --> 28:47.294
So he must have been planning
this hack the whole time.

28:47.296 --> 28:50.380
(Carlos) <i>I still have
control of the building.</i>

28:50.382 --> 28:52.382
<i>If you do not release Nicole,</i>

28:52.384 --> 28:54.718
<i>I will drop everyone
off the elevators</i>

28:54.720 --> 28:57.087
<i>from the top floor.</i>

28:57.089 --> 29:01.424
<i>Everyone inside will die.
You have ten minutes.</i>

29:01.426 --> 29:03.677
It's gonna be kind of hard
to release a dead girl.

29:03.679 --> 29:04.978
How many elevators in this building?

29:04.980 --> 29:06.646
And how many of them are occupied?

29:06.648 --> 29:08.682
30 elevators, and as far as occupancy,

29:08.684 --> 29:10.600
I think I can access
security feeds from here.

29:10.602 --> 29:11.651
(computer beeping)

29:12.938 --> 29:15.322
Whoa. Patterson.

29:15.324 --> 29:16.406
Who's in that elevator?

29:19.578 --> 29:21.244
(Patterson) Oh, no.

29:21.246 --> 29:23.363
- Who was that?
- I'm not sure.

29:24.333 --> 29:26.916
(clanking, elevator whirs)

29:26.918 --> 29:29.091
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

29:29.093 --> 29:30.538
Oh, my God.

29:30.540 --> 29:31.839
It's okay.

29:31.841 --> 29:33.206
We're gonna be okay.

29:37.612 --> 29:40.014
Oh, my God. Oh...

29:40.016 --> 29:42.634
(gasping)

29:42.636 --> 29:44.519
You said this was a drill, what's going on?

29:44.521 --> 29:45.687
I don't know, but I'm not gonna let

29:45.689 --> 29:47.856
anything happen to us, all right?

29:47.858 --> 29:50.391
He's lifting every
elevator to the top floor.

29:50.393 --> 29:52.193
Is there anything you
can do to override him?

29:52.195 --> 29:53.895
(Patterson) I can engage the brakes

29:53.897 --> 29:55.947
on almost all of them except SIOC.

29:55.949 --> 29:57.065
Our elevator's on a secure circuit.

29:57.067 --> 29:58.533
There's nothing I can do.

29:58.535 --> 30:00.368
My sister and Reade are in that elevator.

30:00.370 --> 30:02.904
We have to do everything
that we can to stop this guy.

30:02.906 --> 30:04.789
He's gone wireless, so
I can probably track him.

30:04.791 --> 30:06.708
It's gonna take a few
minutes, but I can find him.

30:06.710 --> 30:08.126
What about the doors?

30:08.128 --> 30:10.211
I gotta work on the
elevators one at a time.

30:10.213 --> 30:12.247
- You gotta lance the doors.
- (Mayfair) All right.

30:12.249 --> 30:14.499
Open the door to the stairwell first.

30:14.501 --> 30:16.417
Zapata and I will track the hacker.

30:16.419 --> 30:18.219
You and Jane head up to the top floor

30:18.221 --> 30:20.838
and see if you can pull
them out of that elevator.

30:20.840 --> 30:23.174
We got 70 floors to go. Let's move!

30:26.479 --> 30:27.478
<i>He's in the east wing.</i>

30:27.480 --> 30:28.980
<i>Copy that.</i>

30:38.074 --> 30:39.774
(crashing)

30:40.911 --> 30:42.026
(gasping)

30:42.028 --> 30:43.578
Okay, we're gonna find a way out.

30:43.580 --> 30:44.946
All right? Just be calm.

30:44.948 --> 30:46.030
(Sarah) Oh, my God.

30:51.922 --> 30:54.172
Do you have anything to unscrew these?

30:54.174 --> 30:55.423
Um...

30:56.593 --> 30:57.926
- Um...
- Okay.

30:57.928 --> 30:58.960
This'll work.

31:01.348 --> 31:02.964
All right, okay.

31:06.052 --> 31:07.268
If we're close enough to a floor level,

31:07.270 --> 31:08.469
maybe we can climb our way out.

31:21.201 --> 31:22.450
It's too high.

31:26.790 --> 31:28.740
Come on! Last one up buys drinks.

31:29.709 --> 31:31.125
(Patterson) <i>Got it.</i>

31:31.127 --> 31:32.827
I tracked his tablet's wireless signal.

31:32.829 --> 31:34.746
He's in the service
hallway on the first floor.

31:34.748 --> 31:36.414
<i>How much time do we have?</i>

31:36.416 --> 31:37.715
Less than five minutes.

31:37.717 --> 31:39.083
I have control of the other elevators,

31:39.085 --> 31:41.252
but I can't do anything about SIOC.

31:49.813 --> 31:51.312
Sarah!

31:51.314 --> 31:52.347
Kurt!

31:53.316 --> 31:54.732
- Kurt!
- Reade!

31:54.734 --> 31:56.985
We're gonna get you guys out, all right?

31:56.987 --> 31:58.569
All right, just hang on!

31:58.571 --> 32:00.355
Are we landing?

32:09.699 --> 32:10.982
On your knees!

32:13.420 --> 32:15.036
Don't even think about it.

32:15.038 --> 32:17.088
I told you to release Nicole.

32:17.090 --> 32:18.589
Where is she?

32:18.591 --> 32:20.291
I don't think you understand
the concept of leverage.

32:20.293 --> 32:22.794
The elevators are set to drop on a timer,

32:22.796 --> 32:25.129
unless I input my password.

32:25.131 --> 32:28.766
The elevator drops in...
two minutes, 50 seconds.

32:28.768 --> 32:30.768
If you kill me, everyone dies.

32:30.770 --> 32:34.889
Now, what was that about leverage?

32:36.142 --> 32:37.725
All right, back up.

32:40.063 --> 32:41.062
No, no, no, no...

32:41.064 --> 32:42.063
One at a time.

32:42.065 --> 32:43.364
Come on, Reade.

32:43.366 --> 32:45.116
- I'm very afraid...
- We gotta move fast.

32:45.118 --> 32:46.868
I'm very, very afraid of heights.

32:46.870 --> 32:49.704
Calm, just put your left arm
through here and your head.

32:49.706 --> 32:51.289
"Calm." Just keep saying it.

32:51.291 --> 32:52.707
Weller, ready!

32:52.709 --> 32:53.741
(grunting)

32:56.413 --> 32:57.995
Calm. Not calm!

32:57.997 --> 33:00.381
Not calm, not calm, not calm, not calm!

33:04.387 --> 33:06.587
Here we go. Okay, arms up.

33:06.589 --> 33:07.588
You're safe.

33:07.590 --> 33:08.890
(Weller) Reade!

33:08.892 --> 33:10.091
You both gotta get on!

33:10.093 --> 33:11.259
We're running out of time!

33:11.261 --> 33:13.227
Copy!

33:13.229 --> 33:14.429
All right.

33:14.431 --> 33:16.481
Put your left arm through first.

33:16.483 --> 33:18.232
Listen, what I said before...

33:18.234 --> 33:20.985
No, we'll talk about it when we
both get on solid ground, okay?

33:20.987 --> 33:22.487
All right?

33:22.489 --> 33:23.521
She's all set!

33:23.523 --> 33:24.772
(Weller grunting)

33:27.994 --> 33:29.911
All right, stay calm.

33:30.997 --> 33:33.498
Come on. Just hold on tight.

33:37.087 --> 33:38.503
(grunting) Oh, God.

33:39.506 --> 33:41.005
(Weller shouts)

33:41.007 --> 33:42.340
It's not strong enough!

33:42.342 --> 33:43.708
All right, well, take Sarah

33:43.710 --> 33:45.042
then throw the hose back down for me!

33:45.044 --> 33:46.177
No, I'm not leaving you!

33:46.179 --> 33:47.512
Sarah, you gotta go now.

33:47.514 --> 33:49.430
Stop the countdown, now!

33:49.432 --> 33:52.517
Let Nicole go... and
no one has to get hurt.

33:52.519 --> 33:53.551
Carlos...

33:53.683 --> 33:54.982
_

33:54.984 --> 33:56.684
_

33:56.686 --> 33:58.065
_

33:58.656 --> 33:59.665
_

34:11.905 --> 34:12.987
Can you override it?

34:12.989 --> 34:15.907
It's a 256-bit encryption key.

34:15.909 --> 34:16.908
Not enough time.

34:16.909 --> 34:18.242
Arms up, arms up.

34:18.244 --> 34:19.744
Get over there.

34:21.547 --> 34:22.630
Reade, get ready!

34:27.887 --> 34:28.920
(Weller) Just hold on tight.

34:30.139 --> 34:33.341
(Reade shouting)

34:33.342 --> 34:35.059
(crash, all gasping)

34:36.228 --> 34:37.395
(Weller grunting)

34:37.397 --> 34:39.147
Reade! You okay?

34:39.149 --> 34:41.349
I'll be better when you pull me back up.

34:49.703 --> 34:51.780
- You okay?
- Hey.

34:51.782 --> 34:53.532
A few nicks and bruises,
nothing that won't heal.

34:53.534 --> 34:54.616
(chuckling)

34:56.286 --> 34:59.037
You're safe now, little sis.

35:00.341 --> 35:01.590
Hey, Kurt.

35:01.592 --> 35:03.258
Can Sarah and I get a minute?

35:03.260 --> 35:04.376
Yeah.

35:06.347 --> 35:07.746
Uh...

35:07.748 --> 35:10.115
Hey, are you okay?

35:10.117 --> 35:13.885
My heart rate's finally
in the double digits, so...

35:13.887 --> 35:15.520
Sarah, there's something you need to know.

35:15.522 --> 35:17.439
So I'm moving to Portland.

35:17.441 --> 35:20.942
Um, my ex lives there and...

35:20.944 --> 35:25.530
I think Sawyer needs to have
a relationship with his father.

35:25.532 --> 35:26.948
When did you decide this?

35:26.950 --> 35:29.067
I've been on the fence for a few weeks,

35:29.069 --> 35:32.320
and, uh, with what happened today,

35:32.322 --> 35:34.156
it just became very, very clear.

35:34.158 --> 35:36.491
I mean, if something had happened to me,

35:36.493 --> 35:37.909
what would Sawyer have done?

35:37.911 --> 35:39.327
But nothing happened, you're fine.

35:42.049 --> 35:44.883
I'm sorry for what I said in there.

35:44.885 --> 35:47.753
This is not about you. It's not about us.

35:47.755 --> 35:50.756
I just really need to do
what's right for my family.

35:53.894 --> 35:55.060
Come here.

35:59.933 --> 36:02.651
Hey...

36:02.653 --> 36:04.019
Good work up there.

36:04.021 --> 36:05.654
You too.

36:05.656 --> 36:07.439
Patterson dug down on those hackers.

36:07.441 --> 36:08.740
They did the same thing

36:08.742 --> 36:11.443
to the Mexican Secret Service last year.

36:11.445 --> 36:12.911
You okay?

36:13.997 --> 36:15.363
Something on your mind?

36:17.167 --> 36:19.367
I don't know how to say this.

36:19.369 --> 36:20.919
It's okay. You can tell me.

36:22.256 --> 36:24.122
Kurt, I, um...

36:25.626 --> 36:27.426
I totally beat you up the stairs.

36:27.428 --> 36:29.761
Really? Wow.

36:29.763 --> 36:32.047
All right. Fine.

36:32.049 --> 36:33.715
- Whatever helps you sleep at night.
- Mm-hmm.

36:33.717 --> 36:35.100
You owe me a drink.

36:35.102 --> 36:36.852
And you still owe me one for my birthday.

36:36.854 --> 36:39.855
Wow... racking up the debt.

36:39.857 --> 36:41.523
Never seems to work out.

36:41.525 --> 36:43.108
What about tonight?

36:43.110 --> 36:44.226
Sure.

36:44.228 --> 36:45.644
Okay.

36:45.646 --> 36:47.646
- I could definitely use a drink.
- Yeah.

36:51.735 --> 36:53.118
Bethany Mayfair,

36:53.120 --> 36:54.736
you're under arrest
for first-degree murder.

36:54.738 --> 36:56.455
Hands behind your back.

36:57.991 --> 36:59.207
What the hell is going on?

36:59.209 --> 37:00.208
You'll read that in the paper tomorrow.

37:00.210 --> 37:01.743
We gotta get her to holding.

37:01.745 --> 37:05.380
The hell you are. Not
without an explanation.

37:05.382 --> 37:08.216
Actually, it might be better
for you to hear this, too.

37:08.218 --> 37:09.634
Put her in the interrogation room.

37:11.588 --> 37:13.004
(Weitz) <i>For someone
who's just been arrested,</i>

37:13.006 --> 37:14.723
<i>you seem awfully relaxed.</i>

37:14.725 --> 37:16.842
Because I know what you're gonna say.

37:16.844 --> 37:18.477
(chuckles) Oh...

37:18.479 --> 37:19.728
<i>Please, I would love to, uh...</i>

37:19.730 --> 37:21.513
<i>My prints were all over the room.</i>

37:21.515 --> 37:24.015
<i>I had blood on my hands
from checking her pulse.</i>

37:24.017 --> 37:26.101
- That is all true.
- So, to clarify,

37:26.103 --> 37:28.603
I should have let Alexandra bleed out

37:28.605 --> 37:31.907
so as not to interfere
with an active crime scene.

37:31.909 --> 37:33.575
Well, ahem, let's start with this.

37:33.577 --> 37:35.577
Alexandra Harrison was an alias.

37:35.579 --> 37:37.245
Her real name was Donna Hollaran.

37:37.247 --> 37:39.164
She was a disgraced
private-eye-turned-fixer,

37:39.166 --> 37:41.500
and she's been under federal
investigation for a decade.

37:41.502 --> 37:43.118
(laughing) So, apparently,

37:43.120 --> 37:45.871
I didn't even know her name,
and you think I killed her.

37:45.873 --> 37:47.622
Yes.

37:47.624 --> 37:50.425
Along with Saul Guerrero
and the CIA's own Tom Carter.

37:50.427 --> 37:52.210
What about Kennedy and Hoffa?

37:54.181 --> 37:56.181
Here's what I think happened.

37:56.183 --> 37:58.683
For years, you and Carter
had an off-book project.

37:58.685 --> 38:01.052
I'm guessing something that
involved some legal dealings

38:01.054 --> 38:04.105
with everyone's favorite
Latin mob boss, Saul Guerrero.

38:04.107 --> 38:05.690
When he gets arrested,

38:05.692 --> 38:07.442
you two are afraid he's
gonna roll over on you,

38:07.444 --> 38:09.611
and so you and Carter have Guerrero killed.

38:09.613 --> 38:11.563
But Carter, maybe he doesn't
warn you about the timing,

38:11.565 --> 38:12.981
'cause you're there when the hit goes down.

38:12.983 --> 38:14.566
You think he's trying to implicate you,

38:14.568 --> 38:16.368
so you and Carter have
words, things get heated,

38:16.370 --> 38:18.787
ba ba ba, and then you kill Carter, too.

38:18.789 --> 38:20.572
(scoffs)

38:20.574 --> 38:22.157
- Are you finished?
- No.

38:22.159 --> 38:23.825
No, not quite.

38:23.827 --> 38:25.827
<i>See, Carter's murder,
that wasn't planned.</i>

38:25.829 --> 38:26.912
<i>You needed help making
that body disappear,</i>

38:26.914 --> 38:28.163
<i>so you call Donna.</i>

38:28.165 --> 38:29.714
<i>She wasn't on FBI's radar</i>

38:29.716 --> 38:31.216
<i>and you trade her favors for help,</i>

38:31.218 --> 38:32.667
<i>but then she tries to blackmail you.</i>

38:32.669 --> 38:33.919
<i>And you pay at first,</i>

38:33.921 --> 38:36.004
<i>but then she wants more,</i>

38:36.006 --> 38:39.674
<i>and so you kill Donna
to close a loop.</i>

38:39.676 --> 38:40.842
This is ridiculous.

38:40.844 --> 38:42.093
This is a witch hunt.

38:42.095 --> 38:45.230
Murder charges require evidence.

38:45.232 --> 38:46.898
That's right, yes, they do.

38:46.900 --> 38:48.934
And I was just about to get to that.

38:48.936 --> 38:50.902
Let's start with the paper trail,

38:50.904 --> 38:52.404
or rather lack thereof.

38:52.406 --> 38:54.689
Now, I assume that you and Donna

38:54.691 --> 38:56.608
had crossed paths over the years?

38:56.610 --> 39:00.328
We met last week, long
after Carter went missing.

39:00.330 --> 39:01.997
Right. Right, right, right.

39:01.999 --> 39:03.331
So you said.

39:03.333 --> 39:04.699
Still, though, on a hunch,

39:04.701 --> 39:06.534
I wanted to check the FBI file on her

39:06.536 --> 39:08.119
and I found that it had been

39:08.121 --> 39:10.672
mysteriously erased off the server.

39:10.674 --> 39:12.624
Stick it into any FBI computer.

39:12.626 --> 39:13.842
It'll do the rest.

39:13.844 --> 39:15.293
(Mayfair) <i>We've just been hacked.</i>

39:15.295 --> 39:17.929
Our entire server was compromised.

39:17.931 --> 39:19.464
<i>Could be... could be
just a coincidence.</i>

39:19.466 --> 39:21.349
<i>So we had Donna's movements tracked</i>

39:21.351 --> 39:22.884
<i>using the GPS in her phone</i>

39:22.886 --> 39:24.302
and cross-referenced
that with every vehicle

39:24.304 --> 39:26.855
in your FBI fleet, and sure enough,

39:26.857 --> 39:28.390
two of those locations

39:28.392 --> 39:30.275
matched up exactly on the night
