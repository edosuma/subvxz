Balki, I’ll see you later.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.566
Jennifer and I
are going to a movie.

01:40.634 --> 01:41.668
[sniffing]

01:43.369 --> 01:45.171
[sniffing]

01:47.574 --> 01:50.577
‐What’s that smell?
‐I’m glad ya asked.

01:50.611 --> 01:54.280
That’s my rootin’, tootin’,
high falootin’ Texas chili.

01:54.314 --> 01:57.217
Yee‐haw!

01:57.250 --> 01:58.685
I’m making it
for my Western barbecue

01:58.719 --> 02:00.353
I’m caterin’ for
this Saturday night

02:00.386 --> 02:02.122
at Gorman’s Banquet Hall.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.190
Phoo‐ching!

02:07.393 --> 02:08.862
Good for you, Balki.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.363
They, they’re gonna enjoy chili.

02:10.395 --> 02:11.397
[chuckles]

02:14.501 --> 02:15.736
Mm...

02:15.769 --> 02:18.438
[coughs]

02:18.471 --> 02:20.874
Hot, hot, ho‐ho‐ho...

02:20.907 --> 02:22.242
[panting]

02:29.616 --> 02:30.917
Nice shot.

02:32.352 --> 02:33.453
Thank you, partner.

02:38.925 --> 02:41.194
Well, who are you cooking for?

02:41.227 --> 02:43.530
Well, a, a herd of Texans

02:43.564 --> 02:45.832
have moseyed on up here
to Chicago.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.267
They’re, uh, gettin’ together

02:47.300 --> 02:48.869
for some big wingding
Saturday night

02:48.902 --> 02:50.704
at Gorman’s Banquet Hall

02:50.737 --> 02:53.540
and they’re gonna be wigglin’
their yellow toes of Texas.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.575
[laughs]

02:56.309 --> 02:57.978
You know,
I, I never thought I’d say this

02:58.011 --> 03:00.847
but could you talk the way
you usually do?

03:02.949 --> 03:04.484
Well, of course, I can.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.819
Don’t be rye‐diculous.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.923
‐Balki.
‐Okay, okay.

03:09.956 --> 03:12.425
It’s just kind of fun
talking in a Texan drool.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.395
Drawl. Texas drawl.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.699
Well, Balki,
your‐your catering business

03:18.732 --> 03:20.400
is really taking off.

03:20.433 --> 03:22.302
I mean, what is this,
your fifth job in five weeks?

03:22.335 --> 03:23.837
Well, I could have had a sixth

03:23.870 --> 03:26.406
but with all the overtime
I’m doing at the newspaper

03:26.439 --> 03:28.642
I didn’t want to do two jobs
on the same night.

03:28.675 --> 03:29.710
Well, why not, Balki?

03:29.743 --> 03:31.912
If‐if you want
your business to succeed

03:31.945 --> 03:33.814
y‐you’ve gotta grow.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.783
Well, I don’t know, cousin, I...

03:36.817 --> 03:39.285
Most of me stopped growing
when I was 16, although...

03:41.321 --> 03:42.956
...I don’t think
my nose got the message.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.561
No, Balki, I‐I’m‐I’m talking
about expansion.

03:49.462 --> 03:52.766
Okay, okay, maybe I’ve left
my belt out a couple of notches.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.269
No reason to get personal,
shorty.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.574
No, Balki, wh‐what I’m saying is

04:00.607 --> 04:03.510
is that if you want your
catering business to succeed

04:03.544 --> 04:05.846
you gotta start taking
more jobs.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.714
Oh, well, I...

04:07.748 --> 04:10.483
You know, I’m just starting out.
I want to go slow.

04:10.517 --> 04:11.918
Well, Balki, you’ve got
to seize the opportunity

04:11.952 --> 04:13.453
when it presents itself.

04:13.486 --> 04:16.356
Uh, if I may use an example
from my own life‐‐

04:16.389 --> 04:17.891
I’ll put on some coffee.

04:17.923 --> 04:21.528
Wait, no, no, no.
No, this, this one is short.

04:21.562 --> 04:24.531
Is it shorter
than your Bunky McDermott story?

04:24.565 --> 04:26.567
Yes, it’s shorter
than my Bunky McDermott story.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.935
Probably a little longer than
your Grandmama Appleton story.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.004
Yes, it’s, it’s a little longer
than my Grandmama‐‐

04:31.037 --> 04:33.006
Okay, so it’s approximately

04:33.039 --> 04:35.408
in between
the Bunky McDermott story

04:35.441 --> 04:37.711
and the Grandmama Appleton
narrative.

04:37.744 --> 04:38.912
Alright, B‐Balki, Balki!

04:38.945 --> 04:40.714
If you’d let me tell the story,
I’d be done by now.

04:40.747 --> 04:43.283
Okay, okay, tell the story.
Who’s stopping you?

04:46.386 --> 04:48.689
‐Uh, when I was eight‐‐
‐Should I sit down for this?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.927
When I was eight, uh...

04:53.960 --> 04:57.363
my friend and I had this,
this little, uh, lemonade stand.

04:57.397 --> 04:59.533
And, uh, my friend suggested
that we expand

04:59.566 --> 05:01.367
and sell ice cream cones.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.903
And I said, uh, "No, no.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.471
L‐let’s, let’s take it slow.
We’re not ready."

05:05.506 --> 05:08.509
And, uh, he went off
and sold ice cream cones.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.944
And if I’d
listened to him, uh...

05:10.977 --> 05:13.013
today it would have been

05:13.046 --> 05:15.582
Baskin‐Appleton’s 31 Flavors.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.821
Well, that’s a
very nice story, cousin.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.924
And it explains why regret
eats up so much of your day.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.995
But, uh, cousin,
when I’m ready for more work

05:29.029 --> 05:30.997
I’ll let you know.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.634
Now, if you’ll excuse me,
partner...

05:33.667 --> 05:35.902
I gotta hightail it
down to the general store

05:35.936 --> 05:37.971
and rustle up some fixin’s

05:38.004 --> 05:40.541
for my Myposian‐Western grub.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.444
We use real grubs, you know?

05:48.882 --> 05:51.451
Pfff. Ah!

05:54.187 --> 05:55.822
[telephone ringing]

05:57.190 --> 05:58.992
Hello?

05:59.025 --> 06:00.594
Mr. Gorman?

06:00.627 --> 06:03.797
Oh, oh, Mr. Gorman
of Gorman’s Banquet Halls.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.466
Yeah, well, well, uh, I’m sorry,
uh, Balki just rode out.

06:06.499 --> 06:09.636
Uh, went out. Uh, well...

06:09.670 --> 06:11.805
Oh, you‐you‐you want him
to cater a‐a‐another party

06:11.838 --> 06:13.139
on Saturday?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.442
Well, well, who’s it for?

06:16.476 --> 06:18.645
The Calorie Counters’ Club.

06:18.679 --> 06:19.913
Well...

06:19.946 --> 06:22.949
Yeah, I‐I‐I think
he could handle that.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.652
Yeah, uh, well, alright, let‐let
me take down the information.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.121
Uh, alright. Well, go ahead.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.155
Uh‐huh.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.058
Uh‐huh.

06:33.860 --> 06:34.861
Uh‐huh.

06:36.963 --> 06:39.766
Uh‐huh. Okay.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.936
Now, now that’s, uh, "Low salt,
low fat, low calorie."

06:42.969 --> 06:46.773
I got it. Yeah, I’ll make sure
Balki gets the information.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.809
Yeah. No, thank you.

06:48.842 --> 06:49.843
Bye‐bye.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.480
He is gonna thank me for this.

06:55.982 --> 06:58.852
[instrumental music]

07:02.122 --> 07:04.658
[telephone ringing]

07:04.691 --> 07:05.959
Don’t hang up, don’t hang up.

07:05.992 --> 07:08.695
Oh. Wait.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.496
Don’t hang up, don’t hang up.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.433
Don’t hang up.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.971
[telephone ringing]

07:23.710 --> 07:26.079
Hello.
Bartokomous‐Appleton residence.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.213
How may I direct your call?

07:28.715 --> 07:30.884
Why, yes,
this is the Balki Bartokomous

07:30.917 --> 07:33.053
who caters parties
for Gorman’s Banquet Hall.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.889
Oh, come on, monsieur.

07:35.922 --> 07:37.958
I am not the best caterer
in Chicago.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.560
[laughs]

07:39.593 --> 07:41.227
Oh, no, I’m not.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.197
Oh, no, I’m not.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.801
Oh, no, I’m not.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.571
Alright, o‐okay, okay, maybe
I’m in the top three. Um...

07:52.005 --> 07:54.274
Uh, how can I help you?

07:54.307 --> 07:57.678
A German party? For Saturday?

07:57.711 --> 07:59.946
Well, uh, let me
tell you, Gunther.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.282
You see, I already
have a job for Saturday.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.819
And I try never to take two jobs
on the same night.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.654
Really?

08:07.688 --> 08:10.090
Well, uh,
that’s what Cousin Larry says.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.760
Cousin Larry.

08:13.794 --> 08:17.163
Well, he’s my‐my‐my best friend
and advisor.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.567
He’s, uh,
he’s sort of my tormentor.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.538
Well, maybe I could take
two jobs

08:24.571 --> 08:26.607
on the same night.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.176
Well, uh, well, okay. I would
love to cater your party.

08:30.210 --> 08:33.580
Danke schoen. Thank you
for all the love and pain.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.517
Um, let‐let me just get
something to write on.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.785
Okay. Okay, shoot.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.121
[chuckles]
Yeah.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.957
[instrumental music]

08:49.295 --> 08:52.032
Oh, cousin,
I hope I did the right thing.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.668
Taking two catering jobs
on one night.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.537
I hope I’m not breading myself
too thin.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.306
Balki, relax,
everything is fine.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.742
We’ve got all the food unpacked

09:01.775 --> 09:04.611
easy access
to the two banquet rooms.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.813
Everything is perfect.
I’ll help in the kitchen.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.015
And Jennifer and Mary Anne
will serve.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.917
Yeah, this is gonna be fun.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.153
I was a waitress in high school,
but it’s been a long time

09:13.186 --> 09:15.656
since I’ve served people
food and drinks.

09:15.689 --> 09:16.823
Mary Anne,
you do that every day.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.025
You’re a stewardess.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.361
Oh, right!

09:21.394 --> 09:23.329
Uh, why don’t we put out
the silverware?

09:23.363 --> 09:25.932
Um, where’s the silverware?

09:25.966 --> 09:27.901
Oh, okay,
the silverware is in the car.

09:27.934 --> 09:30.837
Uh, the forks and knives
are in the glove compartment

09:30.871 --> 09:32.639
and the spoons are in the back

09:32.673 --> 09:34.274
next to the Garfield
stuck on the window.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.913
Well, you see, you have
everything under control.

09:39.946 --> 09:41.247
I knew you could do it.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.917
Come on, Mary Anne,
let’s get the silverware.

09:43.950 --> 09:47.688
Balki, the food
for the Texas barbecue

09:47.721 --> 09:48.955
smells delicious.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.056
Oh, thank you.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.992
[chuckles]

09:52.025 --> 09:53.927
So what are you making
for the second party?

09:53.960 --> 09:55.796
‐German food.
‐German food?

09:55.829 --> 09:56.897
Uh‐huh.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.099
Well, isn’t German food
a little rich and heavy

09:59.132 --> 10:00.233
for Calorie Counters?

10:00.266 --> 10:01.768
Oh, boy, you got that right.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.304
The sauces alone
would pack on the pounds.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.973
I would never serve German food
to Calorie Counters.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.809
[laughs]
Cherish the thought.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.377
Good. So we’re in agreement.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.146
Well, you got that right.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.815
So what are you really serving
to the second party?

10:14.848 --> 10:17.684
Um, wiener schnitzel
and sauerbraten

10:17.718 --> 10:20.153
with goatwurst pate.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.122
Wiener schnitzel, sauerbraten
with goatwurst pate?

10:22.155 --> 10:23.690
Isn’t that high in calories?

10:23.724 --> 10:27.160
Not to mention,
loaded with cholesterol.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.129
Well, then why are you
serving it to Calorie Counters?

10:29.162 --> 10:31.097
Cousin, I’m not serving it
to Calorie Counters,

10:31.131 --> 10:32.232
I’m serving it to Germans.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.299
Haven’t you been
paying attention?

10:33.333 --> 10:35.068
W‐w‐wait, wait, wait.

10:35.101 --> 10:39.005
L‐l‐let’s concentrate
for, for just a minute here.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.941
‐Party number one is Texans.
‐Texans.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.042
Party number two is...

10:42.075 --> 10:43.376
‐Germans.
‐Calorie Counters.

10:43.409 --> 10:44.778
‐Germans.
‐Calorie Counters.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.846
‐Calorie Counters?
‐Germans?

10:48.381 --> 10:51.251
[crowd chanting]
’We want food, we want food!’

10:51.284 --> 10:53.053
’We want food!’

10:53.086 --> 10:54.988
(both)
Oh, my Lord!

11:11.471 --> 11:14.140
How could you book a party
for me without telling me?

11:14.174 --> 11:15.341
I‐I left you a note!

11:15.375 --> 11:17.043
You said you were catering
a second party.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.212
How was I to know it wasn’t
the party I booked for you?

11:19.245 --> 11:20.947
Well, I didn’t see your note!

11:20.981 --> 11:23.049

you’ll leave me a note?

You think I have ESPN?

11:26.987 --> 11:28.922
Okay, we have the silverware.
Everything’s ready.

Oh, God!

11:38.398 --> 11:39.900
...a plan!

11:41.134 --> 11:42.869
We’ll just cut down
on the portions

11:42.903 --> 11:45.271
and serve all three parties
using the food for two.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.774
Cousin, we cannot give
the Calorie Counters this food.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.475
It wouldn’t be good
for their diets.

11:49.510 --> 11:51.277
Well, so we serve them some food

11:51.311 --> 11:53.213
with a little salt
and a little fat.

the Calorie Counters on.

so much easier on Mypos.

and everyone runs under it.

back from the Texans

to take food away from Bubba.

through your back pocket.

Mr. Bubba Sir.

away from these people.

from his ribs.

get the plates away

let the Texans finish eating

the Calorie Counters.

22:17.571 --> 22:18.672
Mostly to blame.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.644
Alright,
it was totally my fault.

22:23.677 --> 22:26.747
I‐I‐I shouldn’t have butted
into Balki’s business.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.915
I‐I‐I shouldn’t have pushed him
before he was ready.

22:34.721 --> 22:35.822
But you know...

22:37.724 --> 22:40.360
...uh, when y’all get a chance
to think about what happened...

22:41.962 --> 22:44.364
...I think you’re gonna thank me
for what I did tonight.
