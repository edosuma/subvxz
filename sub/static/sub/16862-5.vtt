00:01.320 --> 00:03.480
Previously on rescue me...

00:05.960 --> 00:08.770
So if I get a little old or a little sick,I should just kill myself.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.920
- Is that--
- Shut up,asshole!

00:11.410 --> 00:13.170
What do you got,8 years on the job?

00:13.190 --> 00:13.690
I was standin' right next to him--

00:13.720 --> 00:14.840
Shut up!

00:14.880 --> 00:16.260
It was jerry's life,

00:16.290 --> 00:18.630
and he made a choice,and obviously is was a pretty severe choice,

00:18.660 --> 00:20.000
but you wanna know somethin'?

00:20.030 --> 00:23.010
I give the guy all the respect I have for goin' out on his own terms.

00:23.060 --> 00:25.310
I think he's all gavin-- half johnny,half you.

00:25.350 --> 00:26.900
Ok,you know what?

00:26.930 --> 00:30.280
This-- if he was half johnny,he-- he'd hate me.

00:30.310 --> 00:33.770
And he's got the blond peach fuzz comin' in.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.340
Yeah,but that doesn't mean anything.

00:35.370 --> 00:38.610
In a couple of months,he could end up with a full head of jet-black hair.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.930
Oh,goddamn it,jimmy!
I want that probie!

00:40.960 --> 00:42.800
You guys have a solid basketball team.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.930
You've won 5 out of the last 8 division championships.

00:45.960 --> 00:46.800
6.

00:46.830 --> 00:48.440
You're datin' the guy who saved your life?

00:48.470 --> 00:49.560
Yeah.

00:49.580 --> 00:52.030
You are so cute.

00:52.900 --> 00:54.430
Yeah,he loves you.He talks--

00:54.460 --> 00:56.710
That's not--we don't need to--ok.

00:56.740 --> 00:58.170
What do you want it to say?

00:58.200 --> 01:03.980
Um,"to troy.Your buddy,tommy."

01:04.010 --> 01:05.990
He's so cute.

01:06.010 --> 01:08.560
So you two seem to be getting along famously.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.820
I know.
I have the baby magic.

01:10.850 --> 01:11.420
Ok.

01:11.450 --> 01:12.280
- Oh,no,no.
- Yeah.

01:12.310 --> 01:13.810
No,let me take the baby.

01:13.830 --> 01:17.320
Ah,he gets a little cranky at lunch.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.220
It's done.That--that thing,that chemistry--

01:20.240 --> 01:22.500
- we don't have that thing anymore.
I'm starting to have that thing--

01:22.500 --> 01:24.280
- You don't have that thing for me anymore.
- I do.

01:24.310 --> 01:27.330
My thing is just having A...

01:27.350 --> 01:30.910
You have never not gotten hard for me.

01:30.930 --> 01:33.010
It's just--I--it's not you.

01:33.030 --> 01:37.290
Michael,your mom,she's passed.

01:37.820 --> 01:40.260
Maybe I'd come and hang out with you,you know,

01:40.280 --> 01:41.650
lift your spirits a little.

01:41.670 --> 01:43.220
That's really cool,sean.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.360
I forgot,like,what a good friend you can be.

01:48.130 --> 01:50.280
Plus I might be gettin' a divorce.

01:53.930 --> 01:55.920
Ok.
Shh.

01:57.410 --> 02:00.240
Yeah,I just finished shopping.

02:00.940 --> 02:03.210
Hey,honey.Come on.
Just a few seconds,ok?

02:03.240 --> 02:06.640
Please?
Help mommy get--sweetie.

02:07.930 --> 02:09.900
Ok.Ok.
Did you hear that?

02:09.919 --> 02:11.770
I need to know if you're coming home tonight.

02:11.800 --> 02:12.480
Yeah,I'm comin' home.

02:12.510 --> 02:14.100
Honey,I'm in the middle of a tour.

02:14.120 --> 02:17.040
The day's just started,and he's already making me insane.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.740
Well,what do you want me to do about it?

02:18.760 --> 02:20.250
He cried the whole time in the market.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.720
People were staring at me,

02:21.760 --> 02:24.600
you know,like I was poking him with a stick or something when they weren't looking.

02:24.630 --> 02:25.670
I gotta go.

02:25.690 --> 02:27.470
Say hello to prince for me.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.850
- Hey.
- What's up?

02:30.890 --> 02:32.680
I haven't heard from you in almost 4 days.

02:33.010 --> 02:34.100
I've been busy.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.430
- Oh,my god.
- What?

02:36.460 --> 02:38.710
Jesus christ!
Shit!

02:38.730 --> 02:40.130
Mom?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.430
Mom!

02:48.250 --> 02:51.660
Oh,my god.
My baby.Oh,my god.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074

03:16.550 --> 03:19.120
We can't put him in the shitter.
It's just not right.

03:19.150 --> 03:20.300
Wait a second.
I just said that.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.400
Why doesn't anybody listen to me?

03:21.440 --> 03:22.770
To preserve our sanity.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.320
Can't have him sittin' here on the table,'cause it's just-- I don't know.

03:25.340 --> 03:28.610
Just eatin' dinner,dead guy starin' at you.
It's disturbing.

03:28.630 --> 03:29.390
You know what?

03:29.420 --> 03:31.220
What if it's not really the chief in there?

03:31.240 --> 03:32.910
Hey,no,the kid's got a point.I mean,

03:32.930 --> 03:35.050
it's ashes.For all we know,could be anna nicole smith.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.970
Well,does silicone burn?

03:36.990 --> 03:38.040
Not in that quantity.

03:38.060 --> 03:40.110
Seriously,I mean,that really could not be him.

03:40.140 --> 03:41.810
Funeral homes make that kind of mistake all the time,right?

03:41.840 --> 03:44.750
- Like when they bury the wrong corpse.
- Shut up,sean.

03:44.770 --> 03:47.750
I mean,most funeral homes are-- are careful and honest.

03:47.770 --> 03:48.380
You're right.I'm--

03:48.410 --> 03:51.860
your mom,I'm sure,is planted exactly where she's supposed to be.I--

03:51.880 --> 03:53.630
- all right.I'm gonna look.
- Hey,hey!What are you doing?

03:53.660 --> 03:54.910
Hey!I've never seen ashes before.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.610
You little grave-robbin' ghoul,you.Come on.

03:56.630 --> 03:57.970
- Leave the chief alone.
- All right.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.870
- Show a little respect for the dead.
- All right.

03:59.910 --> 04:01.630
How would you like somebody poking through your ashes?

04:01.650 --> 04:03.140
- All right.
- Yeah.

04:03.170 --> 04:04.770
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.150
Ah,screw it,right?
Not like he's gonna know.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.710
Oh,cool.

04:12.740 --> 04:13.620
Wow.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.810
Looks like the bottom of my dustbuster.

04:16.649 --> 04:18.899
Hey,is that a tooth?

04:20.920 --> 04:24.320
Well,definitely not anna nicole's ashes.

04:24.350 --> 04:25.650
Why's that?

04:25.680 --> 04:28.570
'Cause if they were,we'd all have a contact high by now.

04:29.100 --> 04:32.380
Can't believe the chief's actually in there.
It's kind of creepy.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.260
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:33.290 --> 04:34.330
Spooky.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.300
Oh,jesus christ!

04:38.270 --> 04:40.030
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

04:40.060 --> 04:41.220
Nothin'.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.660
Anyway,needles wants to see us all upstairs in the locker room pronto.

04:48.290 --> 04:49.830
Let's go.

04:52.790 --> 04:55.220
Looks like the chief's putting on a little weight.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.130
Listen,jerry was a great guy and a great firefighter,

05:19.160 --> 05:22.860
so i got--I got big shoes to fill,but,uh,

05:22.890 --> 05:24.570
I'm not gonna push.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.350
I'll get used to you guys,you'll get used to me,

05:26.380 --> 05:28.800
and before you know it,we'll find a groove.

05:28.820 --> 05:31.200
And I can tell you from experience,chief feinberg,

05:31.230 --> 05:32.410
he's one of the good ones.

05:32.440 --> 05:34.690
He'll treat you fair,won't break your balls.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.300
Man's a prince.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.660
You owe me 20.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.450
Try to collect,you little shit.

05:39.470 --> 05:41.730
Call me chief sid,chief sidney,chief whatever.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.700
Just don't call me chief feinberg.

05:43.730 --> 05:45.150
Chief feinberg was my father.

05:45.180 --> 05:47.450
He's been dead many years.

05:47.470 --> 05:49.450
He was a mitzvah,believe me.

05:50.090 --> 05:51.670
Read the bullshit.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.950
Ok,we're gonna use young garrity's locker for a little show and tell.

05:55.970 --> 05:57.210
What?

05:57.240 --> 06:00.800
Now,as of today,F.D.N.Y.Says...

06:00.820 --> 06:03.720
Because of the equal opportunity...

06:03.740 --> 06:06.130
Ah,equal employment.
Settle down.

06:06.150 --> 06:09.340
Certain items will no longer be allowed in our lockers.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.300
Excuse me.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.630
I-in our personal lockers?

06:11.650 --> 06:14.270
Which are open sometime when there are others in the room.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.570
- Oh,yeah.
- Oh,my god.

06:15.590 --> 06:16.460
Yeah?

06:16.480 --> 06:20.760
"No displays of sexual,ethnic,religious,and/or

06:20.790 --> 06:22.830
racial themes in a derogatory manner..."

06:22.870 --> 06:25.350
Sexual,racial,religious,ethnic.What's left?

06:25.370 --> 06:26.060
Nothin'.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.300
American flags and

06:27.320 --> 06:29.580
- mass cards are acceptable. - Oh,great.Yeah,those are hilarious.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.060
Yeah,great.So much for the separationf church and state.

06:32.070 --> 06:33.500
- What's that?
- Exactly.

06:33.530 --> 06:34.990
You know,look.Now,I don't know about you guys,

06:35.010 --> 06:37.810
but I need naked chick pictures in my locker,all right?

06:37.830 --> 06:39.290
I mean,you know,I come back from a job,

06:39.310 --> 06:40.980
I'm thinking of rubbing one out in the shower,

06:41.010 --> 06:44.000
lookin' at an american flag ain't gonna grease the rails,you know what I mean?

06:44.030 --> 06:45.990
I mean,don't get me wrong.I love the american flag,but,

06:46.020 --> 06:48.020
you know,I'm used to salutin' it,not jerkin' off to it.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.880
Whoa.Wait a second.Are you jerkin' off in this shower here?

06:50.910 --> 06:51.910
Sometimes.

06:51.930 --> 06:54.510
I'm buying some flip-flops,like,6 pairs.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.460
Ok,can we focus,please?

06:56.480 --> 06:58.710
Garrity,for example,you have to get rid of this,uh,

06:58.740 --> 07:01.610
centerfold,the cartoon of the arab hijacker...

07:02.530 --> 07:03.810
this picture of your mother.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.060
Wait a second.What the hell's wrong with the picture of my ma?

07:06.080 --> 07:08.150
She got a cock on her face.

07:08.790 --> 07:09.850
Goddamn it!Which--

07:09.870 --> 07:12.870
which one of you drew a cock on my mother's face?

07:12.890 --> 07:13.950
It was you,wasn't it?

07:13.970 --> 07:15.810
Wh-what's with the finger?
What are you lookin' at me for?

07:15.830 --> 07:18.350
Well,you do like to draw cocks.

07:18.370 --> 07:20.530
Yeah,cocks and world war ii air battles.

07:20.550 --> 07:21.030
True.

07:21.060 --> 07:23.610
Now,if she had a cock and a world war ii air battle on her face,

07:23.640 --> 07:26.030
then I could possibly see him eyeing me as suspect number one--

07:26.050 --> 07:28.180
All right,come on.Which one of you assholes did it?I'm serious.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.200
Maybe it was y-your dad,you know,

07:30.220 --> 07:32.890
trying to get your mom thinkin' in a certain direction.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.050
This is the second time this has happened,boys,all right?

07:35.070 --> 07:36.230
And the last time,by the way,

07:36.260 --> 07:38.030
'cause if it happens again,I'm gonna find out who did it,

07:38.060 --> 07:39.940
and I'm gonna go to your actual mom's house,

07:39.970 --> 07:43.370
and I'm gonna draw a real cock on her real face,ok?

07:43.400 --> 07:44.590
Except for you,mike,of course,

07:44.620 --> 07:46.050
'cause your mom just-- you know,she's dead.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.720
You know?The rest of you,oh,yeah.

07:47.740 --> 07:51.190
Well,my mom's dead.You--you went to her funeral.It was 2 years ago.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.480
Yeah.
My mom died 10 years ago,sean.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.440
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:54.460 --> 07:56.150
My mom is very much alive.

07:56.180 --> 07:57.810
Though she actually has a--

07:57.830 --> 08:01.370
a cock tattoo right here,uh,on her lower lip.

08:01.390 --> 08:03.320
- You can barely notice it,really.
- Well,it's faded.

08:03.340 --> 08:05.650
- Assholes,all of you.
- You know that?Bye.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.920
Tell your mom we said hello.

08:06.940 --> 08:09.100
- Clear 'em out,guys.
- Clear 'em out.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.520
Locker inspections are scheduled.
Could happen as soon as tomorrow.

08:12.540 --> 08:14.870
Listen,uh,as a way of getting to know each other,

08:14.900 --> 08:16.140
I'd like to take you all out to dinner.

08:16.160 --> 08:19.970
I know a great barbecue spot underneath the williamsburg bridge.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.120
You can bring your wives,your girlfriends,whatever.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.500
Friday sound good?

08:24.520 --> 08:25.320
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:25.350 --> 08:26.440
Friday's--friday's great,chief.

08:26.460 --> 08:28.280
- Thanks a lot.Thanks,chief.
- Fantastic.Great.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.800
I'll make the reservations.

08:29.820 --> 08:31.750
Break bread,have a few laughs.

08:31.770 --> 08:34.720
Before you know it,we're the ganza mishpucha.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.539
See you later.

09:36.340 --> 09:38.300
- Hello.
- Hey,nona.Hey.

09:38.330 --> 09:39.340
Hey.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.280
Yeah,how you doin'?

09:41.330 --> 09:44.510
Good.Just bought a new shop-vac for my garage.

09:44.530 --> 09:46.270
Motor on mine burned out last night.

09:46.290 --> 09:47.310
Oh,yeah.Well,that'll--

09:47.330 --> 09:49.740
that happens with the shop-vacs with the,uh,motors.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.430
Hey,you know,um,uh,you know,

09:52.450 --> 09:55.460
this whole time we've been kinda--ahem-- 

09:55.480 --> 09:56.520
foolin' around and...

09:56.540 --> 09:57.920
Oh.Is that what we've been doing?

09:57.940 --> 10:01.390
Well,no,I know.I know I've acted like--like an idiot,but,uh,

10:01.410 --> 10:03.540
here's the thing.My wife--ahem-- 

10:03.570 --> 10:05.610
- Oh,here we go.
- No,no.No.No.

10:05.630 --> 10:09.170
Look,it's-- she's been hinting this whole time about us 

10:09.190 --> 10:10.460
kind of getting back together again,and--

10:10.470 --> 10:12.580
 Oh,this is making me so hot,tommy.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.660
I just--but hear me out.
Hear me out.

10:14.690 --> 10:16.450
So,I mean,this is good news,actually.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.960
It's-- it's great news,actually.

10:18.980 --> 10:23.090
It-- well,it's shitty news for-- for me and her,but--and-- 

10:23.120 --> 10:24.980
and the kids,but--and the baby.

10:25.010 --> 10:29.100
But,uh,it's--it's over.
It's done.

10:29.130 --> 10:33.020
So,uh,you know,I'm a-- I am free and clear.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.900
No more marriage.
How 'bout that?

10:34.930 --> 10:36.070
How 'bout what?

10:36.090 --> 10:39.270
What?What do you want me to say,congratulations?

10:39.290 --> 10:42.260
Uh,well,no,what I'm saying is--is that,

10:42.280 --> 10:44.170
you know,I'm-- I'm ready.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.390
You know,I'm ready to rock and--

10:47.410 --> 10:51.350
and,uh,roll.You know,I'm ready to have some--

10:51.370 --> 10:55.610
some really great,hot,steamy,

10:55.630 --> 10:58.880
you know,s-sex.
And dinner.Too.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.140
I--I don't know.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.360
Well,nona,I--I'm-- the reason I'm calling,I'm back to the old me,

11:03.390 --> 11:06.670
and--and that-- I know you don't even know that--that me,but I'm-- 

11:06.690 --> 11:09.640
this is the--you're talkin' to him.I'm here.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.040
I'm back.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.640
Hello.

11:15.670 --> 11:19.180
Ok,listen to me.
No more bullshit,ok?

11:19.200 --> 11:21.440
We eat,we drink,we screw,

11:21.470 --> 11:24.110
- and that's it.You got it?
- Got it.

11:24.130 --> 11:26.440
- Tomorrow night.
- Ok.

11:26.470 --> 11:28.830
- I'll pick you up.
- Great.

11:28.850 --> 11:30.940
- 7:30.
- Yes,sir.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.200
What?

11:33.520 --> 11:34.990
I--I said,uh-- 

11:35.010 --> 11:37.020
Yeah,I heard what you said.Don't say it again.

11:37.050 --> 11:38.440
Ok,I'm sorry.

11:38.470 --> 11:39.650
Good-bye.

11:39.670 --> 11:41.840
Shit.
She makes me nervous.

12:05.820 --> 12:07.140
Theodore.

12:07.150 --> 12:08.280
Shit!

12:08.290 --> 12:10.040
Son of a bitch sold me out!

12:10.060 --> 12:11.270
For a song.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.450
- He was sick of it.
- Sick of what?

12:13.450 --> 12:17.670
The drinking,the farting,the fighting.

12:17.690 --> 12:19.040
The drinking.

12:19.060 --> 12:22.490
I'm not the same man I was when you married me,ellie.I've changed.

12:22.510 --> 12:25.030
I've had some revelations.

12:25.050 --> 12:28.050
I don't wear pants,and I don't adhere to the rules of society.

12:28.080 --> 12:28.910
I'm a rebel.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.290
All right,well,just put something on,ok?

12:31.310 --> 12:33.460
I'm takin' you to rehab right now.

12:33.480 --> 12:37.900
You need to make a decision,theodore,right now.

12:37.920 --> 12:40.910
It's either me or the booze.

12:40.930 --> 12:45.060
You decide right this very instant.

12:47.180 --> 12:49.040
Theodore!

12:50.420 --> 12:51.790
I'm thinkin'.

12:55.130 --> 12:56.660
Hello.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.760
Maggie.

12:59.410 --> 13:00.680
You home?

13:01.660 --> 13:02.970
Hello.

13:03.540 --> 13:04.600
Hey.

13:04.630 --> 13:05.850
What are you doing here?

13:05.870 --> 13:08.890
Well,I--I live here.I hope.

13:08.910 --> 13:10.270
I mean,that's what I--

13:10.300 --> 13:12.200
about the other day,what I said-- I didn't--I didn't--

13:12.230 --> 13:15.580
I was just frustrated,you know,and I-- 

13:15.600 --> 13:17.500
I love you,and I'm committed to this relationship,

13:17.520 --> 13:19.230
and i don't want a divorce,ok,

13:19.260 --> 13:21.810
so can we just--we just pretend that that didn't happen?

13:21.820 --> 13:23.770
Hey,who's the dude?

13:23.800 --> 13:24.960
That's my ex.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.900
I'm not your e--who the hell is this guy?

13:26.930 --> 13:29.020
Oh,I met him in the bar last night.It's don,right?

13:29.040 --> 13:30.860
- Tom.
- Tom.Right.Whatever.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.490
You happy for embarrassing me in front of tom?

13:33.500 --> 13:35.840
Next time you drop by,you might wanna call first.

13:35.860 --> 13:38.010
I'm not dropping by,maggie.I live here!

13:38.030 --> 13:39.510
All of my stuff is here!

13:39.530 --> 13:41.720
I--are you wearing my flip-flops?

13:41.730 --> 13:42.950
That's another thing.

13:42.970 --> 13:46.570
About your stuff,think you could pack it up and get it out?

13:46.590 --> 13:48.110
I need the extra space.

13:48.140 --> 13:50.950
Oh,you could use the extra space.For what,more bottles,

13:50.980 --> 13:55.020
maggie?Is that what this is-- you're--this is so--I don't-- 

13:55.040 --> 13:57.110
- I want a divorce.
- You're already getting one!

13:57.130 --> 13:59.790
Oh,yeah.Well,I want a real one this time.I'm not kidding.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.220
I want a real divorce.

14:01.260 --> 14:04.360
And someday you're gonna realize what you're losing right now,ok?

14:04.390 --> 14:06.800
Someday.
Not right now.Someday,then.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.180
Now--not-- 

14:08.210 --> 14:09.910
not now.You know what I'm talking about!

14:09.930 --> 14:11.910
Don't you-- forget it.
Just forget it.

14:21.140 --> 14:23.230
How long since you guys split?

14:23.250 --> 14:26.010
I'd say about 36 hours ago.

14:26.450 --> 14:28.410
Some people have trouble,uh,movin' on.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.020
You're not one of those people,are you,don?

14:30.040 --> 14:31.950
Tom.
I don't think so.

14:31.970 --> 14:33.750
Good.Then get out.

14:43.030 --> 14:44.900
- Baby?Are you ok?
- Yeah.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.930
Yeah,honey.
Give me a second.

14:48.970 --> 14:50.840
Jesus.
Are you sick?

14:51.510 --> 14:53.360
I'm fine.
Really,it's,uh-- it's nothing.

14:53.380 --> 14:55.600
Oh,my god,you look awful.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.600
You feel a little warm.
Is it something you ate?

14:57.620 --> 14:58.690
No,no,no.
No,I'm good.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.080
Maybe you shouldn't go to the match.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.330
No,no.Baby,it's hockey,

15:01.350 --> 15:02.460
all right.It's not tennis.

15:02.490 --> 15:04.630
I'm fine,really.It's just,um,

15:05.440 --> 15:07.470
there's,uh--there's something I wanna say to you,

15:07.490 --> 15:09.790
and,uh,it's a little major,I guess.

15:09.810 --> 15:11.330
What is it?

15:14.010 --> 15:15.390
Oh,shit.

15:15.970 --> 15:17.230
You're breakin' up with me.
Is that it?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.120
No,no,no.Baby,let me talk-- 

15:18.140 --> 15:20.370
You asshole.You know,I knew you wouldn't be able to commit.

15:20.390 --> 15:21.920
You are such a goddamn child-- 

15:21.940 --> 15:24.580
Could you please let me talk?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.710
Listen,I love you,nat.

15:30.020 --> 15:32.080
I really do,

15:32.100 --> 15:33.680
and I've given this a lot of thought,

15:33.710 --> 15:35.800
and,you know,life is,uh--

15:35.830 --> 15:37.560
it's too short,you know.

15:37.580 --> 15:39.640
It's too valuable,and I-- 

15:41.170 --> 15:43.080
I was hopin' that—

15:45.890 --> 15:47.520
Will you marry me?

15:49.390 --> 15:51.080
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.050
Yeah,I'm serious.
Will you?

15:54.060 --> 15:55.210
Yes.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.680
Yes,I will marry you,franco.Yes!

15:57.700 --> 15:59.440
Aw,that's great,baby.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.310
I'd seal it with a kiss,but I think I got chunks in my teeth.

16:02.330 --> 16:03.990
Could you get me a clean shirt,please,sweetie?

16:04.010 --> 16:05.660
Yeah.
Yeah.

16:09.550 --> 16:10.790
Hey.
Come on in.

16:11.150 --> 16:13.710
Yo,dude,you comin' to the game?
We should probably get goin'.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.440
Yeah,I'm--I'm not really in the mood.

16:15.460 --> 16:18.050
- You ok?
- Yeah,yeah.I just--

16:18.070 --> 16:20.430
you know how I need to stay here for a couple of days?

16:20.460 --> 16:22.400
I think it might be a little longer than that.

16:22.420 --> 16:24.440
Yeah.It's all good.
Whatever you need,bro.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.310
All right,cool.
Thanks.

16:26.330 --> 16:29.880
Hey,um,do I have to sleep in here?

16:29.900 --> 16:31.270
Yeah.
This is my old room.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.730
Well--are these your dolls?

16:33.740 --> 16:35.010
No,they're my mom'S.

16:35.030 --> 16:37.580
Except gerard here.
He's mine.

16:38.160 --> 16:41.150
The rest my mom moved in after I moved out.

16:42.070 --> 16:43.790
It's a nice room,right?

16:44.980 --> 16:47.050
Listen--can I,uh-- 

16:47.060 --> 16:49.240
can I sleep someplace else?

16:49.270 --> 16:51.630
There really isn't any other place,sean.

16:51.650 --> 16:53.030
Well.Come on.
What about your mom's room?

16:53.050 --> 16:54.440
You want to sleep in my dead mom's bed?

16:54.470 --> 16:55.650
I mean,what-- what are you,sick?

16:55.670 --> 16:57.040
No.All right.Fine.Jesus.

16:57.060 --> 17:01.510
I'll stay in here in the valley of the dolls and just be watched.

17:01.530 --> 17:03.820
Um,you can't stay here.

17:03.830 --> 17:06.230
Wait a second.You just said that I could stay as long as I needed to.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.790
Yeah,I know,but I mean,I have the hockey game.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.829
Ok,well,I-I'm not goin'.
I feel like shit.

17:10.849 --> 17:12.490
My marriage is in shambles,so...

17:12.510 --> 17:17.069
Yeah,but y-you can't stay in the house alone without me.

17:17.089 --> 17:18.950
Ok,well,I'm not going to the game,

17:18.970 --> 17:20.270
mike,so what--what do want me to do,

17:20.319 --> 17:22.829
walk the streets until you come home?

17:24.050 --> 17:25.660
Pretty much.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.829
Ok.

17:39.690 --> 17:42.650
Thanks,kevin,for your story and your honesty.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.660
Sounds like you're in a good place.

17:45.310 --> 17:47.570
- Theodore-- 
- Oh.C-call me teddy.

17:47.590 --> 17:49.970
Teddy,good.

17:49.990 --> 17:55.890
Tell us how you came to be with us and what you hope to achieve during your time here.

17:55.900 --> 17:59.240
Well,to tell you the truth,I just got out of the joint.

17:59.270 --> 18:02.510
I killed a child murderer,piece-of-shit drunk driver.

18:02.530 --> 18:04.300
You may have read about it in the papers.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.070
I'm kind of a folk hero.

18:06.090 --> 18:07.520
Let me tell you,

18:07.550 --> 18:11.240
some of the letters I got offerin' me pussy,you wouldn't believe.

18:11.270 --> 18:12.820
Blow your freakin' mind.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.120
I carry a couple of 'em around with me,

18:15.140 --> 18:17.190
pull 'em out whenever I need a little pick-me-up.

18:17.220 --> 18:18.860
Check out this one from marcia.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.030
Um,thank you for the offer,teddy,

18:21.050 --> 18:25.460
but we want to stay focused on addiction and recovery.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.510
Kind of a downer,but,hey,

18:27.530 --> 18:29.620
it's your circle,pal.
Go ahead and jerk it.

18:30.380 --> 18:33.020
You're here to break your addiction to alcohol?

18:33.040 --> 18:36.240
Oh,you bet your ass.
I'm gonna take a break for 30 days.

18:36.260 --> 18:37.620
I'm lookin' forward to it.

18:37.630 --> 18:41.880
Well,teddy,it's about more than the next 30 days.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.880
It's about staying sober for the rest of your life.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.590
Oh,no,no,no.I'm-- 

18:46.610 --> 18:48.450
I'm just here for the cleansing,

18:48.480 --> 18:50.680
you know,recharge my batteries.

18:50.710 --> 18:52.730
Staying sober for the rest of your life?

18:52.760 --> 18:55.000
Who the hell would want to do that?

19:02.990 --> 19:04.830
Taxi!
Wait!

19:08.580 --> 19:10.120
Hey,pal,you checking in?

19:10.140 --> 19:11.570
I don't know if you read the brochure or not,

19:11.600 --> 19:14.510
but one of the big things they expect of you is to stop drinkin' 

19:14.540 --> 19:15.700
for life!

19:15.710 --> 19:16.950
It's lunacy!

19:16.980 --> 19:18.540
Think about this long and hard.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.670
This could be the biggest mistake you ever make.

19:20.690 --> 19:22.270
To the nearest bar,jeeves.

19:22.290 --> 19:23.590
Pronto!

19:24.290 --> 19:25.480
Think about it.

19:36.100 --> 19:39.440
Tommy!
Tommy!

19:39.450 --> 19:41.350
Yeah!

19:41.910 --> 19:43.540
Did you see that?He looked at me.He totally remembers me 

19:43.570 --> 19:44.490
Yes.Would you please calm down?

19:44.520 --> 19:46.810
Ok!
Whoo!

19:46.830 --> 19:48.330
Whoo!

20:02.960 --> 20:04.260
Jeez.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.280
Come on.
F.D.N.Y.!

20:14.210 --> 20:15.650
Come on.

20:19.980 --> 20:21.720
You should have got an assist on that,gavin.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.310
His legs were wide open,for christ's sake.

20:23.340 --> 20:24.820
Jeez.
You're like a turnstile.

20:24.850 --> 20:26.620
I gotta put a token in you these days?

20:26.640 --> 20:28.470
I don't really know hockey,but 

20:28.490 --> 20:30.130
tommy doesn't look like he's playing all that well.

20:30.150 --> 20:31.760
Well,he's played better.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.600
Hey,what took you so long?

20:33.620 --> 20:35.390
- Oh,I had to hit the head.
- What,again?

20:35.410 --> 20:36.540
You been going a lot.
You ok?

20:36.570 --> 20:38.710
Yeah.I,uh--I asked natalie to marry me today.

20:38.740 --> 20:40.730
- What?
- And I said yes.

20:40.750 --> 20:41.820
Congratulations.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.150
- Thank you.
- Let me see.That is amazing,you guys.

20:44.170 --> 20:45.220
Congratulations.

20:45.240 --> 20:48.260
- Now of course it all becomes clear.
- It's gorgeous.

20:49.470 --> 20:51.700
- Let's go,boys!
- Come on,guys.Come on.Let's go.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.300
Come on,tommy.

20:59.900 --> 21:01.890
Yes!
Yes!

21:02.040 --> 21:03.270
Kick their ass.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.820
Nice play,gavin.

21:11.840 --> 21:12.800
Thanks,buddy.
Get off.

21:12.930 --> 21:14.350
Jesus.

21:15.220 --> 21:17.100
- You're done.
- What?

21:17.130 --> 21:19.510
Oh,my god,you suck.

21:19.530 --> 21:21.900
- What?What are you talkin' about?
- You're playin' so stinkin' terrible.

21:21.920 --> 21:22.520
They got their front-- 

21:22.540 --> 21:24.380
You look like you're suckin' your own dick out there.

21:24.410 --> 21:27.800
You understand what that means?
You look like a goddamn fag.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.000
That's their best player.
I mean--he's--you know.

21:30.030 --> 21:31.760
Do I care if it's his best player?

21:31.780 --> 21:34.130
You're supposed to be our best player.You're terrible!

21:34.150 --> 21:36.030
Mikey,I want you to go out there.You--

21:36.060 --> 21:37.270
- you-- 
- Are you shittin' me?

21:37.290 --> 21:38.520
- No.I'm not shittin' you.
- I've been 

21:38.530 --> 21:40.740
skatin' on this line for 7 years.You've been coachin' for what,

21:40.770 --> 21:42.140
- a week?
- I don't care.You understand?

21:42.140 --> 21:43.280
I don't care.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.730
Mikey,you get out there.

21:44.760 --> 21:45.860
- Come on.
- I'd rather not,izzy.

21:45.890 --> 21:46.880
What do you mean,you'd rather not?

21:46.920 --> 21:47.810
That's tommy's line.

21:47.840 --> 21:51.340
I don't care if it's tommy's line.
Get out there now.

21:51.370 --> 21:54.230
All right,I know.Just replacing tommy,I feel uncomfortable.

21:54.250 --> 21:55.300
Uncomfortable?

21:55.320 --> 21:57.520
How about if I stick this stick up your ass?

21:57.550 --> 22:00.200
That'll really make you feel uncomfortable.Now get out there!

22:00.220 --> 22:01.420
Go on.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.690
Sorry,man.
And you just sit there and shut up.

22:03.930 --> 22:07.380
Oh,bullshit.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.960
- Just sit there.
- Bullshit.

22:08.970 --> 22:10.720
Sit here and watch.

22:10.740 --> 22:12.530
Maybe you'll learn somethin'.

22:12.550 --> 22:14.480
They're takin' tommy out.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.630
What the hell?!

22:16.650 --> 22:18.100
Come on,you guys.
Let's go.

22:18.440 --> 22:22.490
You do not pull tommy gavin,assholes!

22:22.550 --> 22:24.100
Get down.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.490
Hey.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.550
What is going on with you and tommy?

22:27.570 --> 22:29.890
It is seriously freakin' me out.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.500
What are you talking about?

22:32.510 --> 22:35.440
You touched his jeans,and now you're wearing the same pair.

22:35.460 --> 22:37.610
You're wearing the same stupid peacoat that he wears all the time.

22:37.630 --> 22:39.590
It's like you're turning into tommy gavin.

22:39.610 --> 22:42.900
Um,for your information,I had my eye on these jeans 

22:42.920 --> 22:46.060
long before I ever met tommy,and as for the peacoat,

22:46.080 --> 22:47.560
guys all around the world wear them.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.860
It's sort of an established look,

22:49.890 --> 22:51.480
has been for a number of years now.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.080
Sailors wear them.Blah blah blah-- 

22:53.100 --> 22:54.950
Ok.

22:54.970 --> 22:57.410
Don't you dare say,"blah blah blah." 

22:57.440 --> 23:00.410
I swear to god if you ever say,"blah blah blah," again,I will cut you.

23:00.430 --> 23:02.950
Oh,tommy invented "blah blah blah." 

23:02.990 --> 23:05.580
He owns the rights to "blah blah blah"?

23:05.960 --> 23:08.440
You know what I say to that?
Blah blah bl-- ow!

23:20.710 --> 23:21.760
Mikey!

23:21.790 --> 23:24.410
Hey,how 'bout that,huh?
Way to go,mike.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.370
Watch the back door!

23:53.360 --> 23:54.410
Good match.

23:54.430 --> 23:55.600
- Good game.
- Good game.

23:55.620 --> 23:57.120
Good game,man.

23:57.140 --> 23:58.840
What the hell was that?

23:58.850 --> 24:00.300
What are you talking about?
See the scoreboard?

24:00.320 --> 24:02.310
You kiddin' me?
What,your knees shot?

24:02.330 --> 24:04.180
- What?
- Yeah.You got cancer or something?

24:04.200 --> 24:05.390
Yeah,I got cancer,asshole.

24:05.410 --> 24:07.050
You know,why don't you do yourself a favor,all right?

24:07.070 --> 24:08.610
First of all,why don't you put an orange jersey on,

24:08.640 --> 24:10.570
'cause you played like a goddamn pylon today.

24:10.580 --> 24:11.700
- Yeah.
- And secondly,

24:11.720 --> 24:14.980
why don't you put yourself in a nice,over-40 league,all right,old man?

24:15.010 --> 24:15.960
That's where you belong.

24:15.990 --> 24:17.360
- Oh,yeah,tough guy?
- Yeah.Yeah.

24:17.380 --> 24:18.810
Let's drop 'em right now.

24:18.820 --> 24:20.950
Come on.
Let's go.Come on.

24:20.970 --> 24:23.530
I'm not fightin' a third-line guy,tom.

24:29.870 --> 24:32.520
Bonehead.
Shit.

24:34.330 --> 24:36.070
He didn't want to fight.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.160
Hey,buddy.

24:45.180 --> 24:46.460
Hey.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.860
How's tricks?

24:49.020 --> 24:51.230
Fine.You guys like the game the other night?

24:51.250 --> 24:53.500
Oh,yeah.Well,uh,that was his idea.

24:53.530 --> 24:55.670
He's kind of like your biggest fan.

24:55.690 --> 24:57.070
Yeah.

24:57.740 --> 25:00.120
Am I,uh,nuts,or was he,uh,

25:00.140 --> 25:02.270
kind of dressed like me the other night?

25:02.290 --> 25:05.440
- What--no.
- With the peacoat?No?

25:05.460 --> 25:06.920
No.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.320
Ok.
I'll see you later.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.000
Wait.
I--wait,wait,wait,wait,wait.

25:10.020 --> 25:11.330
Wait,wait,wait.
Just wait a minute.

25:11.350 --> 25:13.600
I have something for you.

25:16.310 --> 25:17.360
What's this?

25:17.380 --> 25:19.250
I got my insurance money.

25:19.850 --> 25:20.970
Come here.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.170
Get-- 

25:34.110 --> 25:35.370
400 grand?

25:35.400 --> 25:37.840
Yeah.That's an advance on your cut.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.780
I can't take this.

25:43.620 --> 25:44.780
Oh,what,you don't need it?

25:44.800 --> 25:46.840
Wait.Just wait a minute.
Just hear me out.

25:46.860 --> 25:50.100
Look,you can use this to start up your girls' college education.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.400
You can-- you can beef up your retirement fund.

25:52.430 --> 25:55.670
You can,um,maybe take some pressure off you and janet so you can--

25:55.700 --> 25:58.340
I don't know,work things out for once.

25:58.370 --> 26:00.150
I mean,look.This money,

26:00.170 --> 26:02.990
it solves a lot of problems for all of us.

26:03.670 --> 26:04.900
All of us?

26:04.930 --> 26:06.310
Well,yeah.

26:06.730 --> 26:09.500
I mean,damien's at college,and,

26:09.520 --> 26:12.470
you know,I'm padding around that big apartment all by myself,

26:12.500 --> 26:14.990
except for when troy decides to come over and--

26:15.020 --> 26:17.830
look,I'm-- I'm pretty lonely,

26:17.860 --> 26:22.070
and I got an enormous amount of love to give.

26:26.530 --> 26:28.330
I want you to give me that baby.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.040
- You're crazy.
- No,no,I--

26:30.060 --> 26:32.430
I hate it when you call me crazy.Just listen to me.

26:32.450 --> 26:35.000
You and janet,have you even bonded with this child at all?

26:35.030 --> 26:36.220
Yes,we've bonded with the child.

26:36.250 --> 26:37.990
What?He's,like,7 months old.
He doesn't have a name.

26:38.010 --> 26:40.380
We have been making lists.
Just tryin' to decide.

26:40.410 --> 26:44.270
I love this baby,and that baby loves me.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.490
You saw how we connected.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.760
You saw how he smiled at me,how he was so quiet...

26:48.800 --> 26:49.980
With me.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.230
I can give that baby the best of everything in life.

26:54.250 --> 26:59.320
And--and you really wanna be taking care of a teenager in 15 years?

26:59.350 --> 27:00.960
You give me that baby,

27:00.980 --> 27:03.020
and you get your life back.

27:03.060 --> 27:06.280
And not for nothin'.
With this money,it's a life worth living.

27:06.300 --> 27:08.300
You know I'm right.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.930
I can't do it.

27:12.540 --> 27:14.040
A moratorium?

27:14.060 --> 27:18.150
Yeah.Well,it sounds so kinda formal when you say it out loud.I mean,

27:18.170 --> 27:20.190
let's just call it a break.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.280
Look,I love you,theresa,and you're really important to me,

27:24.320 --> 27:27.160
you know,but i mean,the way things have been going,

27:27.190 --> 27:29.840
I mean,anything we do with our clothes on,it just-- 

27:29.870 --> 27:32.860
it just feels like filler until we get into bed or--

27:32.890 --> 27:36.350
or into the shower or on top of the kitchen table or 

27:36.380 --> 27:39.350
in the alley behind the building,

27:39.360 --> 27:41.130
you know?I just-- 

27:41.160 --> 27:44.360
I think that we owe it to each other to 

27:44.430 --> 27:46.190
put the sex on hold,

27:46.210 --> 27:49.460
and let's see what we really have.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.700
And to safeguard against the very real possibility 

27:51.720 --> 27:55.090
that without a breather,my dick's gonna snap off like a twig.

27:56.470 --> 27:58.890
I love you too,honey.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.580
Well,what do you think?

28:00.590 --> 28:02.780
Ok.

28:05.730 --> 28:07.080
To us.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.440
- Ohh.
- That was fun.

28:16.470 --> 28:18.010
Yeah.
It was nice.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.120
- Yeah.
- Thank you...

28:19.150 --> 28:20.530
- You're welcome.
- For dinner.

28:20.570 --> 28:23.170
- It was good,right?
- Yeah.

28:23.190 --> 28:25.070
My pasta was a little mushy.I--

28:25.080 --> 28:27.710
I don't like it when it's mushy,you know?

28:27.730 --> 28:29.500
Garlic bread was good,though.

28:29.530 --> 28:30.890
Yeah.Yeah.
Where to?

28:30.910 --> 28:33.090
Uh,I gotta get to the firehouse.I'm--

28:33.110 --> 28:35.900
yeah.
I got a tour.

28:35.930 --> 28:37.410
Right this second?

28:37.430 --> 28:39.430
No.
I--I got,like,an hour.

28:39.450 --> 28:40.910
Why?

29:03.860 --> 29:05.620
Ok,it's not you.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.490
It's,uh-- 

29:07.510 --> 29:09.600
I--I just--it's been,like,

29:09.620 --> 29:13.120
since around that time you pulled me out of that fire.I-- 

29:13.150 --> 29:15.260
I was havin' this same problem with this chick I was seein' then.

29:15.280 --> 29:15.960
Oh,good.

29:15.980 --> 29:19.190
And it's just become like this whole mental thing.I just--

29:19.210 --> 29:22.640
I mean,normally,I'm tellin' you,a strong breeze could give me A...

29:22.660 --> 29:24.990
Oh,good.
Let's open the window,then.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.120
So confusing.
I swear.

29:28.150 --> 29:31.220
Why?I mean,it happens to-- 

29:31.230 --> 29:33.580
- most guys go through-- 
- Oh,please.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.830
Night of the fire,I pulled you out,

29:34.870 --> 29:38.790
and you had the biggest,most beautiful hard-on.

29:38.810 --> 29:39.880
Really?

29:39.900 --> 29:41.660
Yeah,really.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.310
Yeah.

29:43.330 --> 29:44.550
God.

29:44.570 --> 29:47.010
I remember when I was pulling you out,it was--

29:47.030 --> 29:49.580
it was pokin' through my bunker jacket.It was--

29:49.610 --> 29:52.340
I thought it was my flashlight at first.

29:53.540 --> 29:56.180
- Really?
- Yeah,really.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.160
I mean,we're all standin' there,thinkin' "this guy's unconscious,

29:59.190 --> 30:02.880
but he's got a hard-on,so I guess he really likes fire." I don't know.

30:02.910 --> 30:05.600
- "We all were..." 
- Yes,yes.

30:05.630 --> 30:09.260
"We all." The whole crew.
It was that impressive.

30:14.340 --> 30:15.870
Come here.

30:16.690 --> 30:17.960
Come here.

30:22.370 --> 30:23.600
Give me your hand.

30:24.180 --> 30:25.670
Yeah.

30:27.530 --> 30:28.890
There's the tommy gavin 

30:28.920 --> 30:30.710
- I was hopin' for.
- Yeah.

30:32.650 --> 30:33.780
What?

30:34.300 --> 30:35.620
- In the back.
- Ok.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.570
Yeah.

30:41.930 --> 30:43.440
Yeah.

31:16.270 --> 31:17.830
Jesus.

31:36.140 --> 31:39.170
She knocked ya around pretty good tonight,huh?

31:39.180 --> 31:41.370
Got some ass,that broad.

31:41.390 --> 31:44.320
I know you like 'em tall and thin,like me,

31:44.350 --> 31:48.140
but every once in a while,it's kinda nice to drive the big bus.

31:48.930 --> 31:52.220
By the way,I wanted to give you a little heads-up.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.730
When's the last time you went to a meetin'?

31:54.750 --> 31:56.270
What do you mean?

31:57.900 --> 31:59.450
A.A. Meeting?

31:59.480 --> 32:01.150
Yeah.

32:01.890 --> 32:03.340
What's it to you?

32:03.360 --> 32:05.430
Don't mean shit to me,pal,

32:05.450 --> 32:09.760
but you,you're a whole different story.

32:09.780 --> 32:11.450
Take a look at the book.

32:11.480 --> 32:14.420
Might shed a little light on a few things.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.060
<i>Prayer for the Day</i>

32:47.840 --> 32:55.920
<i>I pray that I may do all I can to love others, in spite</i>

32:56.520 --> 33:05.070
<i>of their many faults. I pray that as I love, so will I</i>

33:06.050 --> 33:07.660
<i>be loved.</i>

33:31.560 --> 33:33.320
All right,gather round,gents.

33:33.330 --> 33:35.810
I bring news from the front,one front in particular.

33:35.830 --> 33:37.150
- You know feinberg?
- Yeah.

33:37.170 --> 33:38.740
- Who?
- The new chief.

33:38.760 --> 33:39.820
The jew chief?

33:39.850 --> 33:41.410
- We should use that.
- It works.

33:41.430 --> 33:43.980
Ok,word on the street from several reliable sources,

33:44.010 --> 33:45.840
the guy's hung like seabiscuit.

33:45.870 --> 33:48.130
- The horse?
- No,the C.P.A.Jesus.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.570
- Where you gettin' this shit?
- Oh.Well,um,

33:50.600 --> 33:54.220
barry breeman up in the bronx,not to mention tim green over at 75 truck.

33:54.250 --> 33:55.650
Oh,you mean tim "the tripod" green?

33:55.670 --> 33:59.700
Yes.Now,tim is packing a verified 10 inches.

33:59.730 --> 34:02.450
I've seen pictures,and once,he dropped it into the,uh,

34:02.470 --> 34:04.350
punch bowl during their holiday party.

34:04.380 --> 34:05.960
It was like a visit to loch ness.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.920
Now,he claims that the feinberg schlong makes his look like a cocktail frank.

34:10.940 --> 34:13.460
Wait.Is this like a length thing or a girth 

34:13.489 --> 34:14.929
thing?Not that I want the mental picture.

34:14.949 --> 34:18.620
Look,breeman worked at feinberg's old house,like,10 years ago,

34:18.630 --> 34:20.830
and he saw the thing in the shower once,

34:20.850 --> 34:23.929
and it was all he could do to not coil it up and throw it on the back of the rig.

34:23.949 --> 34:25.969
Jesus christ.What,you think it's,

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
you know,grown since then?

34:27.030 --> 34:28.270
- Hi,chief.Morning.
- Morning,fellas.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.550
Hey.

34:29.570 --> 34:32.520
Printed up some invitations for our party friday night.

34:32.530 --> 34:34.320
- Hope we're still on.
- Yeah.Yeah,yeah,yeah.

34:34.350 --> 34:36.699
Great.'Cause all the information's right here.

34:36.719 --> 34:37.190
Ok.

34:37.210 --> 34:40.770
And,uh,if you love barbecue,you're gonna really dig this place.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.300
I mean,nothing but huge chunks of delicious,

34:43.330 --> 34:45.620
mouthwatering,succulent meat,

34:45.639 --> 34:47.739
huh,cooked to sweet perfection.

34:47.770 --> 34:50.230
I'll tell you,take one bite,you're gonna plotz.

34:50.250 --> 34:51.690
Emes,my hand to god.

34:51.710 --> 34:54.150
And I got a room of our own,

34:54.179 --> 34:57.320
so we can,uh,you know,cut loose and have a ball.

34:57.340 --> 34:58.810
See you later.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.980
Anybody else hear a word he said?'Cause all I could hear was,

35:07.010 --> 35:09.090
"cock cock,blah-diddy blah,cockity-cock,

35:09.120 --> 35:10.340
- cock cock." 
- Yeah,same here,

35:10.370 --> 35:11.450
except when he said the words,uh,

35:11.460 --> 35:13.720
"delicious,mouthwatering,savory meat," at which point,

35:13.750 --> 35:15.580
- all I could hear was myself screaming.
- Wait a second.

35:15.610 --> 35:17.300
When he reached down to scratch his knee 

35:17.320 --> 35:19.970
just then,you think he was actually scratchin' the tip of his joint?

35:19.990 --> 35:21.010
Yeah,jeez,I hope so.

35:21.060 --> 35:22.820
If he was taking a kink out of the middle--

35:22.840 --> 35:25.480
What's with all the,uh-- the jewishisms there.He's-- 

35:25.510 --> 35:26.610
he's definitely the jew chief.

35:26.630 --> 35:27.840
What about the super-hung chief?

35:27.870 --> 35:29.690
Oh,it's just too much of a mouthful.

35:29.710 --> 35:32.680
- I hear screaming again.
- Hey,tom,it's nona.

35:32.710 --> 35:35.840
Oh,it's nona,the voll--hey,you close that deal yet,ace?!

35:35.870 --> 35:37.630
Closed it last night.

35:37.640 --> 35:38.940
Hey,nona.
What's goin' on?

35:38.970 --> 35:40.000
Hey.How you doin'?

35:40.040 --> 35:41.460
I'm doin' good.A little 

35:41.490 --> 35:43.410
sore from last night,but other than that...

35:43.440 --> 35:45.330
Um,you alone?

35:45.350 --> 35:47.060
Yeah,I'm alone.

35:47.090 --> 35:48.210
What's up?

35:48.230 --> 35:50.130
Yeah,I don't want to see you any more.

35:50.160 --> 35:51.900
Right.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.970
Let me--let me call you back on my cell.

35:53.990 --> 35:54.890
Why?

35:54.910 --> 35:56.760
I--a bunch of the guys just walked in.

35:56.790 --> 35:58.590
Let me just--I'll call you right back,all right?

35:58.600 --> 36:00.000
- Yeah.
- Ok.Bye.

36:00.750 --> 36:02.580
Gonna call her on the cell.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.340
She wants to whisper sweet nothings.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.140
Hey,what do you want,a little privacy?

36:06.160 --> 36:08.710
All right.Give the guy his privacy.

36:15.750 --> 36:17.710
- Yeah.
- Hey,do--

36:17.730 --> 36:19.550
what's-- what's the problem?

36:19.560 --> 36:21.380
Look,it's just not working,tommy.

36:21.410 --> 36:23.690
I-I'm tired of makin' the first move all the time,

36:23.720 --> 36:25.020
takin' the first step.

36:25.050 --> 36:27.200
It's hard enough being the woman.
I don't want to be the man,too.

36:27.230 --> 36:28.720
Look,I need a real man.
That's the bottom line.

36:28.740 --> 36:30.630
I am a real man,ok?

36:30.690 --> 36:31.840
I mean,if you're talkin' about that-- 

36:31.890 --> 36:34.700
the time when we were in there in the truck and I couldn't get it up,that was just--

36:34.730 --> 36:36.660
that's never happened to me before.Ok?

36:36.680 --> 36:38.940
And that--that was...

36:39.930 --> 36:41.450
Hang on a second.

36:42.340 --> 36:43.500
I'm just gonna call fiona.

36:43.530 --> 36:44.970
Her--she has an awning,ok?

36:45.000 --> 36:46.880
She has an awning that i couldn't get up on the--

36:46.930 --> 36:50.410
outside of her apartment buildinG.
My shoulder was hurting,ok?

36:50.430 --> 36:52.100
Yeah,yeah.Sure.Sure.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.630
Listen,you gotta give me a second chance here,ok?

36:55.650 --> 36:58.800
I need a man to handle me the way I handled you last night,ok?

36:58.830 --> 37:00.670
You know what?I was planning on doing 

37:00.710 --> 37:03.760
plenty of manhandling,but we got inside that truck,you were like a 

37:03.790 --> 37:05.920
crazed animal.You grabbed me,

37:05.960 --> 37:07.870
ripped my shirt open.You know,I mean,I-- 

37:07.900 --> 37:09.300
I just kind of got--

37:09.330 --> 37:11.260
I was just followin' in your wake,you know.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.460
You were throwin' me around like I was a rag doll.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.920
You were treatin' me like some kind of a sex toy.

37:15.940 --> 37:19.650
At that one point where you flung me from the back seat of the truck into the front seat,I--

37:19.670 --> 37:21.910
I mean,my neck almost snapped in half.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.000
I really--

37:24.500 --> 37:26.160
hang on a second,nona.

37:37.630 --> 37:43.120
Look,tommy,I don't want to hear about death and feelings and penis problems. 

37:43.160 --> 37:44.530
Look,I wanna be used.

37:44.560 --> 37:45.720
I wanna be ignored.

37:45.750 --> 37:47.260
I wanna be taken for granted.

37:47.310 --> 37:49.620
There are no more penis problems,ok,and I'm telling you something,ok?

37:49.660 --> 37:51.710
Using and ignoring,those are,like,

37:51.740 --> 37:53.950
2 of my best things.

37:53.990 --> 37:57.310
A-and takin' chicks for granted,I'm the king of takin' chicks for granted.I mean,

37:57.340 --> 37:58.410
ask my wife.

37:58.430 --> 38:00.570
Ask sheila,ok?
She'll tell you.

38:00.590 --> 38:02.660
- Good-bye,tommy.
- Nona,come on.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.190
No--.

38:09.430 --> 38:10.790
How's it goin' there,princess?

38:10.810 --> 38:12.300
Everything all right?

38:14.670 --> 38:16.140
Sex toy?

38:16.530 --> 38:18.160
That's nice.

38:26.990 --> 38:28.730
So,uh,what do you think,kid?

38:28.750 --> 38:29.820
Who you callin' kid?

38:29.840 --> 38:32.330
Sorry.
Uh,bart.

38:32.350 --> 38:35.310
Look,we got a great house-- lots of calls,lots of action.

38:35.340 --> 38:36.770
Yeah,tons of pussy in the neighborhood.

38:36.810 --> 38:38.170
Great group of guys to hang with.

38:38.210 --> 38:40.090
I still don't see why I should come play for you.

38:40.130 --> 38:41.810
I mean,you guys seem pretty cool,but 

38:41.840 --> 38:43.980
I got 4 other offers on the table.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.570
The guys at 68 truck offered to buy me 6 new pairs of nikes.

38:47.600 --> 38:50.810
Engine 335 offered me a hyundai.

38:50.830 --> 38:53.470
- Hyundai?
- A car.

38:53.480 --> 38:54.710
One of the guys was gonna sell it,

38:54.740 --> 38:58.640
but he said I could use it to get back and forth to work and to the games.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.530
Guess my question is 

39:00.560 --> 39:02.750
what are you prepared to do for me?

39:02.780 --> 39:04.500
Well,what would you like us to do for you?

39:04.520 --> 39:06.430
Truth be told,I don't need a car.

39:06.450 --> 39:07.760
I ride the subway.

39:07.790 --> 39:11.030
And I can drop 40 points on you guys wearin' penny loafers.

39:11.430 --> 39:15.220
All I want to do is fight fires and play ball.

39:15.240 --> 39:17.650
- What do you say to that?
- We're definitely interested.

39:17.670 --> 39:20.560
I don't mop nothin',shine nothin',cook nothin',clean nothin'.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.500
I don't run errands,make beds.

39:22.530 --> 39:23.880
I don't hump equipment.

39:23.910 --> 39:26.370
So in other words,you don't do probie work.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.640
Right.
And another thing.

39:28.670 --> 39:31.540
Nobody calls me probie or kid 

39:31.580 --> 39:34.530
or junior or new guy.That shit don't fly with me.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.670
Do not call me probie.

39:36.700 --> 39:38.330
You got it.
Bart it is.

39:38.350 --> 39:40.240
No.
Don't call me bart,either.

39:40.260 --> 39:42.740
I hate that name.
I've always hated it.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.930
I wanna be called shawn.

39:48.240 --> 39:49.700
Shawn?

39:50.020 --> 39:52.660
Yeah.It's got a nice little ring to it.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.820
I was gonna go with d'shawn,but 

39:54.850 --> 39:57.440
it felt a little like a black cliche.

39:57.480 --> 40:00.060
Plus,I don't wanna write extra letters when I sign my name.

40:00.910 --> 40:02.820
We already have a sean in the house,though.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.940
That's not my problem.

40:05.970 --> 40:07.640
All right.

40:07.660 --> 40:10.030
Shawn it is.
Sounds simple enough.

40:10.580 --> 40:11.540
Yeah.I guess we could manage that.

40:11.560 --> 40:13.450
There's no guessing involved.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.390
Either take the deal,

40:15.430 --> 40:17.530
or I go collect my hyundai.

40:21.630 --> 40:23.920
Welcome to 62 truck,shawn.

40:27.570 --> 40:29.640
A salaam alaikum.

40:38.420 --> 40:39.920
Hello.

40:45.450 --> 40:47.050
Hey.

40:54.380 --> 40:55.810
Hey.

40:56.830 --> 40:58.880
He hates us.

40:58.900 --> 41:01.170
He hates all of us.

41:02.190 --> 41:03.730
Where's your mother?

41:03.750 --> 41:05.280
I don't know.

41:05.310 --> 41:07.420
What do you mean you don't know?

41:10.710 --> 41:12.100
What's goin' on?

41:12.130 --> 41:14.960
He hates us for bringing him into this stupid,

41:14.990 --> 41:16.710
- awful family.
- Hey.Hey.

41:16.740 --> 41:18.540
Come over here.
Come here.

41:18.550 --> 41:19.820
What are you talkin' about?

41:19.870 --> 41:21.860
Mommy hates him.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.220
She says he's killing her.

41:23.270 --> 41:26.600
She cries all the time when you're not here.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.560
- And I hate him,too!
- Hey.

41:28.580 --> 41:31.180
I want connor to come back,and I want that baby to be dead!

41:31.200 --> 41:33.820
Hey--you--hey,come back here.

41:38.900 --> 41:40.090
Where the hell have you been?

41:40.110 --> 41:42.680
What?I just went around the corner.
I was gone 10 minutes.

41:42.700 --> 41:45.490
10 minutes?You leave a-- you leave a baby and another kid here by themselves?

41:45.520 --> 41:47.670
Tommy,so what am I supposed to do,huh?

41:47.700 --> 41:50.540
You've been gone for 4 days.
I'm here all by myself.

41:50.570 --> 41:52.480
You know,I have needs,too,tommy.

41:53.410 --> 41:56.200
That's--that's great.

42:07.890 --> 42:10.150
Shit.

42:20.100 --> 42:22.980
When were you plannin' on tellin' me about that?

42:23.380 --> 42:25.680
Didn't want to spoil the surprise.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.560
Jet-black.

42:27.580 --> 42:29.940
Yeah.Well,a week ago,it was peach fuzz.

42:32.410 --> 42:33.950
You want some?

42:37.110 --> 42:40.250
Well,I--just because 

42:40.300 --> 42:44.880
hair is black,doesn't necessarily mean that he's definitely...

42:45.450 --> 42:47.480
johnny's kid,right?

42:47.500 --> 42:49.820
Whose is he,then?

42:49.850 --> 42:51.620
You tell me.

42:51.640 --> 42:54.190
Aw,just go to hell.

42:56.150 --> 42:57.720
You know...

43:00.800 --> 43:02.070
Great.
