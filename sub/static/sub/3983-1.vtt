Sir, I'm just saying, your ad says,
"Bad credit, no problem."

02:39.040 --> 02:40.485
So can you define "no problem"?

02:40.680 --> 02:43.001
Because me not getting this loan
is a problem.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.322
I'm sorry. That's why
I'm asking you to...

02:46.600 --> 02:49.251

an exclusive platinum lifetime wash card...

13:45.520 --> 13:47.807
for $30,000.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.810
Now, before you say anything...

13:49.960 --> 13:54.170
think about the type of money
that you'll save with this investment.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.766
Well, actually the time value
of money is such that...

13:56.920 --> 14:00.288
if I were to put that same amount
in my own fund...

14:00.680 --> 14:05.049
in 23 years' time,
I'd have in excess of $3 million.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.247
Wow. Yeah.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.768
With that rate of return, I could buy
a new car every time it gets dirty.

- Amazing, Mr. King.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.248

by asking for handouts.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.724
But by hard work.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.441
And today, that hard work paid off...

14:22.600 --> 14:26.127
as I was just named partner in my firm.

14:26.520 --> 14:27.521
Mr. King, that is...

14:35.760 --> 14:38.127
I'm one of the hardest workers
you'll ever meet.

14:38.280 --> 14:41.443
I mean, that's why I'm down here

14:41.600 --> 14:44.001

form a union, and we put our feet down
and say, "Enough!"

26:27.880 --> 26:30.247
- There's gotta be more of us than them.
- There's not.

26:30.440 --> 26:34.161
You deserve everything you're getting.
Good luck on survival, sir.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.806
Better luck on handling yourself!

26:37.040 --> 26:40.522
Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't leave.
Don't leave, please. I could use your help.

26:40.680 --> 26:41.727
Help you with what?

26:43.040 --> 26:45.361
Help me to not be someone's bitch.

26:46.600 --> 26:50.047
You expect me to help you?
I'm supposed to teach you what?

26:50.200 --> 26:51.406
How to prevent this:

26:53.200 --> 26:55.965
- All right, stop.
- You could train me.

26:56.120 --> 26:59.044
You could be the Athena to my Odysseus.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.328
I don't even know
what the fuck that is, man!

27:02.080 --> 27:03.320
I could pay you.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.365
Whatever it takes.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.130
I need $30,000.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.409
- Done.
- Oh...

27:09.600 --> 27:10.840
Okay.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.965
Yup. Yeah.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.481
- Fantastic.
- All right.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.080
What are you doing?

27:18.280 --> 27:19.645
I only know these two.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.770
What are you trying to do?

27:21.920 --> 27:24.810
- Shake? You wanna shake my hand?
- Oh, regular.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.962
- It's a deal. We got a deal.
- Excellent.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.811
- Thank you, Darnell.
- I'll see you in the morning, convict.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.490
What are you doing? What is that?

27:31.640 --> 27:33.005
- Trying to do this thing.
- No.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.969
- Shake. It's fine.
- Okay.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.248
Mr. King, no. I got that.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.642
- All right. No problem.
- I appreciate it.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.001
I appreciate it.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.411
Oh.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.287
Yes! Thank you!

27:50.480 --> 27:52.050
Thank you, Jesus!

27:52.200 --> 27:55.647
I knew it! I knew my day would come.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.484
I'm getting the house.

27:57.640 --> 28:01.361
I'm getting the house. Unh!

28:04.560 --> 28:07.769
Babe. This does not make any sense.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.445
Why would he hire you?

28:09.600 --> 28:12.968
- Because he thinks I went to prison, babe.
- That's the part I don't get.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.771
- Why would you tell him that?
- I didn't. He assumed that.

28:15.960 --> 28:16.961
- He assumed it?
- Yes!

28:17.120 --> 28:20.124
So what reason did you give him
to assume that you went to jail?

28:20.280 --> 28:21.441
I was being black.

28:23.280 --> 28:26.284
- This is nuts.
- Okay. I don't get what's nuts to you.

28:26.440 --> 28:30.126
In 30 days, we'll have the money, the house
will be ours. What is the problem?

28:30.280 --> 28:34.080
The problem is he is never going
to believe that you went to jail.

28:34.360 --> 28:37.682
Look, babe. I am your wife,
so I will put it to you straight.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.003
You are not exactly a thug.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.931
I don't have to be a thug
to portray a thug. Okay?

28:43.680 --> 28:47.651
Honestly, all I gotta do is change
my voice, talk a little deeper.

28:47.800 --> 28:51.122
(IN DEEP VOICE) Talk like this and be
every stereotype he already thinks I am.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.851
Right now, I'm thugging.
This is thugging.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.486
You're so good at it, sweetie.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.650
Have a good night.

28:59.640 --> 29:02.883
- Bitch! Don't walk away from me!
- What the hell did you just say to me?

29:03.040 --> 29:05.441
- (IN NORMAL VOICE) Girl, stop. Stop!
- What is wrong with you?

29:05.600 --> 29:09.002
What is that? I love you! I was playing!

29:11.040 --> 29:13.168
- Bitch.
- What?

29:13.400 --> 29:15.129
- I didn't say nothing!
- Oh.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.123
Man, I didn't say nothing.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.444
You wanna watch The Notebook?

29:19.920 --> 29:22.685
- I love you and Makayla.
- Yeah, I love you too. Good night.

29:26.760 --> 29:29.047
WOMAN (ON RECORDING): You've reached
the mailbox of Martin Clark.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.208
Please leave a message after the tone.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.851
Hi, Dad?

29:33.040 --> 29:34.690
It's James.

29:34.840 --> 29:38.208
Just wondering if there's any word
from the investigators.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.045
I still love you.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.530
Thank you. Bye.

29:44.040 --> 29:47.886
Now, I heard a crazy story about you.
This guy James King?

29:48.040 --> 29:52.682
And I heard that you played at the party
where he got arrested.

29:52.840 --> 29:56.049
Yeah. I had no idea
that I was performing for a monster.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.568
I don't know how to explain what it's like
to take money from someone like that.

29:59.720 --> 30:01.563
It makes you
wanna give it back to them...

30:01.720 --> 30:04.405
except that would be worse
because then they'd have it.

30:05.200 --> 30:09.569
And it's that whole helpless feeling that I have
about our creative process being monetized...

30:09.720 --> 30:12.610
and that's what inspired me
to write this song...

30:12.760 --> 30:15.286
which is actually available
on iTunes tonight at midnight.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.608
- If I can play it.
- Great.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.490
(SINGING) I can't see through walls

30:22.400 --> 30:25.131
And I can't read your mind

30:26.560 --> 30:28.961
But if I did I'd find

30:29.120 --> 30:32.886
That man James King is a great big turd

30:33.720 --> 30:36.803
I mean the small, small kinds

30:37.520 --> 30:39.488
But that **** James

30:39.800 --> 30:42.531
Will fall Hands against the prison wall

30:42.680 --> 30:45.604
Choking on a mouthful of balls

30:45.840 --> 30:48.241
He'll be choking on
A mouthful of balls

30:48.400 --> 30:50.323
I hate to admit it,
but it's a good song.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.324
FALLON: Okay, very nice.
John Mayer, everybody.

30:53.480 --> 30:56.165
Now I'm gonna be dreaming about balls.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.805
DARNELL: Hey, Russell.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.809
It's Darnell.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.442
Your cousin. Your cousin, Darnell, man.

31:03.760 --> 31:04.761
Hey, listen, Russell...

31:04.960 --> 31:08.487
how would you like to make $500
just for telling me what prison was like.

31:10.280 --> 31:13.727
Well, I don't wanna say that.
Russell, I shouldn't have to say that.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.970
For what?! What is...?

31:16.120 --> 31:17.451
Fine. Fine.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.211
I'm a Cliff Huxtable pussy-looking
motherfucker.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.651
No! I'm not even wearing khakis.

31:25.080 --> 31:29.722
Russell, can you please just help me, what I'm
asking you for? Just start from the beginning.

31:29.880 --> 31:34.010
No, no. Like, the beginning, the beginning.
Like, the first day of prison.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.251
On the first day?

31:37.440 --> 31:40.046
Oh. There's no warm-up?

31:40.840 --> 31:41.887
That's sad.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.648
Russell, I'm sorry,
did I just hear a gunshot?

31:44.880 --> 31:47.167
You gotta go. Okay. Bye.

31:56.840 --> 31:57.887
Ready, mother...?

31:58.040 --> 31:59.565
Ready, mother...? Ready, mother...?

31:59.720 --> 32:02.326
That's it, that's it. Ahem.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.284
(DOORBELL RINGS)

32:05.000 --> 32:06.411
Coming!

32:07.720 --> 32:11.361
Rita, Makayla, new house, good school.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.681
You ready, motherfucker?

32:12.840 --> 32:14.524
Just a second!

32:18.920 --> 32:21.730
Hello?

32:21.880 --> 32:23.723
- You ready, motherfucker?!
- Aah!

32:24.640 --> 32:27.246
- Oh, it burns!
- Pepper spray, bitch!

32:28.680 --> 32:30.887
Rule number one:
You always be on guard, okay?

32:31.040 --> 32:33.520
On the inside, there's somebody
on every corner to fuck you up!

32:33.720 --> 32:36.929
Prison school is in session, bitch!
You already failing.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.491
(SCREAMS)

32:39.400 --> 32:42.483
I'm so glad I hired you.
This is just what I need.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.927
Okay. What's next?

32:45.080 --> 32:47.560
What the...?!
How many motherfuckers live here?!

32:47.720 --> 32:50.690
All right. Let's get started.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.487
This right here is
my prison readiness program.

32:53.640 --> 32:57.531
If you follow this guide and do exactly
what I say you will survive in prison.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.406
JAMES: "Keistering."

33:00.560 --> 33:04.804
- What's keistering?
- Slow down! You ain't ready for that.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.081
You're the teacher.

33:06.240 --> 33:10.962
And I just want you to know I'll do whatever
it takes to survive and get my life back.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.963
That's good,
because let me tell you something:

33:13.120 --> 33:15.487
You're gonna have to work harder
than you ever worked before.

33:15.680 --> 33:20.641
Back when I was in Harvard Business School,
I was facing some pretty long odds.

33:20.800 --> 33:23.041
But I buckled down and I succeeded.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.851
When you was at Harvard,
did you ever get raped for failing a test?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.809
I think that's more of a Yale thing.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.291
(CHUCKLING)

33:29.800 --> 33:33.930
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

33:34.960 --> 33:36.371
- "Yale."
- I'm sorry.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.764
Shut the fuck up!

33:41.520 --> 33:44.000
Now from this point on,
this ain't your house no more.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.369
- This San Quentin! You understand me?
- Okay.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.529
DARNELL:
From now on this will be your cell.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.485
You do not leave this room
without my permission.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.485
It's good.

33:57.160 --> 34:00.004
- For you to sleep on, señor.
- Go on, we ain't got time for games.

34:00.160 --> 34:01.810
Go upstairs,
turn this place into prison.

34:01.960 --> 34:05.442
It will be our pleasure to repay you
for your many kindnesses.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.011
Put that in there in front
of the statues with the dicks.

34:11.480 --> 34:12.811
James, listen to me.

34:12.960 --> 34:16.168
The key to survival in prison lies
in the following simple questions:

34:16.360 --> 34:18.442
Are you hard?
And can you handle yourself?

34:18.840 --> 34:23.243
This is a rare moment for optimism because
the answer to that is a resounding yes.

34:23.400 --> 34:26.165
That's good. Let me see
what your mad-dog face look like.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.841
- I'm sorry. What's a mad dog?
- You a mad dog!

34:29.040 --> 34:30.963
- Oh, shit.
- What's your what, nigga?

34:31.120 --> 34:33.360
- Take whatever you want!
- Let me see that!

34:33.520 --> 34:35.045
No!

34:36.239 --> 34:39.005
- Stop! I beg of you!
- Like a pit bull with no leash.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.206
(GROWLING)

34:42.679 --> 34:44.045
That's a mad dog.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.362
Wow. I knew you were
the right guy for the job.

34:46.560 --> 34:50.884
In prison, a mad-dog face is essential to
your survival. Do you understand me, James?

34:51.040 --> 34:55.681
So the idea is that I make a face that conveys
the fact that I'd have no problem hurting you.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.731
Exactly what it is.
Now, convey that shit. Let me see it.

34:58.880 --> 35:01.486
Okay. Ahem.

35:02.520 --> 35:04.124
Ha!

35:04.880 --> 35:06.644
- That's terrible.
- Ha, ha.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.690
No, that's horrible, man. Anger.
You gotta show me anger.

35:09.840 --> 35:13.242
- Why you smiling?
- I'm not smiling. I'm tense and I'm agitated.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.765
Come on, man!

35:15.080 --> 35:16.889
- Unh!
- That's your mad... That's it?!

35:17.040 --> 35:19.441
- Your fiancée left you.
- That's right!

35:19.600 --> 35:21.409
- You happy about that?
- No.

35:21.560 --> 35:24.086
Then get mad! She gonna leave you?
What is she doing?

35:24.240 --> 35:27.926
She probably on her knees sucking
somebody dick in the back seat of a truck.

35:28.800 --> 35:29.847
Show...

35:30.920 --> 35:31.967
James.

35:32.600 --> 35:35.524
Oh. Oh. Come on. Come on.

35:35.720 --> 35:38.803
- I miss her so much.
- What the fuck are you doing, James?

35:39.360 --> 35:40.771
I'm sad-dogging you.

35:43.400 --> 35:46.210
- James?
- You think that's a strategy that could work?

35:46.360 --> 35:48.931
No. I don't think it's a strategy
that could work.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.771
Hey, listen up, everyone.
I'm extremely sad.

35:52.560 --> 35:55.325
Please don't sexually assault me.
I'm already too sad.

35:55.480 --> 35:58.245
Hey, fellas.
My heart's already been raped.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.721
I don't wanna do this anymore.
Let's move on. Okay?

36:00.880 --> 36:04.043
We're moving on from the mad dog.
James, can you fight?

36:05.160 --> 36:06.491
Absolutely.

by its beauty and grace.

That's deadly?

37:21.480 --> 37:24.609
I know I'm not crazy. Didn't I tell you
to get off the phone? Get off the phone.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.724
- Hey, who are you talking to?
- It's Darnell. He's helping me.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.086
Your time is up!

37:29.240 --> 37:31.288
- I gotta go. I'll call you back.
- Hang it up!

37:31.440 --> 37:33.204
- If I get more phone time.
- Hang it up!

37:33.360 --> 37:34.725
That was important to me!

37:34.880 --> 37:37.201
When you got a line of inmates
waiting to use the phone...

37:37.400 --> 37:39.767
you do not wanna piss them off, James.

37:40.080 --> 37:41.889
I'm going to fuck you up, Mr. James!

37:42.040 --> 37:43.201
Rosa!

37:43.560 --> 37:45.244
You watch your back on the yard.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.291
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)

37:48.760 --> 37:50.728
I'm not a puto.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.480
Great.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.968
- All right. We got a problem.
- ATTORNEY: What's that?

37:57.120 --> 37:58.929
James is talking to somebody.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.241
No, no, he trusts you.

38:00.400 --> 38:03.165
- He'll never put two and two together.
- No, stop it!

38:03.320 --> 38:04.924
- This is your fault!
- What?

38:05.080 --> 38:07.321
Well, you couldn't get him
to take the plea deal.

38:07.480 --> 38:12.407
Instead of him going to prison, you got him
30 days to be out there, running around...

38:12.600 --> 38:13.601
fucking things up!

38:13.760 --> 38:18.163
I had to make it look good. You throw a fight,
you don't go down in the first round. It's fine.

38:18.480 --> 38:22.121
I don't want him out there,
playing detective with somebody.

38:23.080 --> 38:25.686
You keep an eye on my
ex-future son-in-law, would ya?

38:25.880 --> 38:29.202
- And find out who this Darnell is.
- I'm on it. Right away.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.925
There you go.

38:33.960 --> 38:37.282
All right, James. Look, you're gonna
get in a fight on the inside. Okay?

38:37.440 --> 38:40.091
You don't need to win,
but you need to show these guys...

38:40.240 --> 38:44.802
that you're not afraid to fight back. Get used
to fighting. See those guys over there?

38:46.600 --> 38:49.843
- Yes.
- Go over there and fight one of them.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.970
That's insane!

38:53.960 --> 38:56.566
They're behemoths.
They would break my spine.

38:56.720 --> 38:59.371
Those are the type of guys
you're gonna see in San Quentin.

38:59.560 --> 39:04.122
So you gotta shake that fear. I want you to go
and punch that big-ass dude in the mouth.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.329
Oh, my God. My heart is pounding.

39:08.920 --> 39:10.445
Okay.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.685
Hey, guys.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.005
Who the fuck are you, man?

39:28.040 --> 39:29.644
I wanna fight you.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.367
What?

39:32.760 --> 39:35.491
You picked the wrong day
to come to the park.

39:37.320 --> 39:40.688
- Is this some kind of joke, man?
- You ever been mad-dogged before?

39:42.160 --> 39:44.527
You about to get some right now,
motherfucker.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.768
What the fuck is that, man?

39:47.920 --> 39:49.729
It's the size of your dick.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.601
I'm gonna break it off, make you eat it.

39:56.240 --> 39:58.766
You fuck your mother with that dick?

39:58.960 --> 40:00.883
How do you know my mama?!
You don't know my mama.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.806
Oh, no.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.045
- Aah! Aah! Aah!
- MAN: Come on! Get him! Get him!

40:06.280 --> 40:07.691
Get back here, bitch!

40:07.880 --> 40:11.726
Oh, no! Please don't hurt my body! Aah!

40:11.880 --> 40:13.689
No! My body!

40:14.000 --> 40:15.047
(SCREAMS)

40:15.200 --> 40:16.486
Help me!

40:16.720 --> 40:18.722
You're breaking my spine!

40:30.840 --> 40:32.365
What happened to my tennis court?

40:32.520 --> 40:37.208
You will no longer refer to this area as a tennis
court. From this point on, this is the yard.

40:37.360 --> 40:41.001
Understand something, James. The yard
is the most deadliest part of prison.

40:41.360 --> 40:45.206
It's where you get your few precious minutes
of fresh air and sunlight. Understand?

40:45.360 --> 40:46.964
Fresh air.

40:47.240 --> 40:51.529
How many times did I breathe in clean air,
fragrant with lavender, and take it for granted?

40:51.680 --> 40:54.684
James, I don't give a fuck how many times.
I don't give a shit.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.729
- I'm just saying.
- Shut up, James.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.804
You gotta step carefully because
if you step in the wrong place...

40:59.960 --> 41:03.169
you'll end up in the wrong territory.
For a person like you that can't fight...

41:03.320 --> 41:06.290
it's not a good thing, James.
It's not a good thing at all.

41:06.600 --> 41:10.047
Right now, you in the brothers-only section.
You got two seconds to get out.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.282
- Before you get mollywhopped.
- Okay, Darnell.

41:12.440 --> 41:13.646
- Who's Darnell?!
- You are.

41:13.800 --> 41:14.961
My name is Leroy!

41:15.120 --> 41:18.283
- Yeah, I suggest you walk, white boy. Walk!
- All right. I'm walking.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.249
- Turn around and walk!
- I'm walking.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.651
- (IN SPANISH ACCENT) Hey, ése.
- What?

41:22.800 --> 41:25.565
- You got a problem, gringo?
- Darnell, what are you doing?

41:25.720 --> 41:29.167
Darnell? Who's Darnell, ése?
You're looking at Carlos.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.244
I suggest you walk wherever you came
from, ése, before you have a problem.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.607
- I was trying to leave that area.
- You need to go back...

41:34.800 --> 41:36.928
- ...over there with the negros, ése.
- With Leroy?

41:37.080 --> 41:39.970
You go back over there with the negros!
That's where you belong.

41:40.120 --> 41:42.202
- I don't see anyone.
- You belong with the Negros.

41:42.360 --> 41:43.521
- Go.
- I'm going.

41:43.680 --> 41:46.160
- (IN NORMAL VOICE) Fuck you calling a negro?!
- He was. I wasn't.

41:46.320 --> 41:49.051
I told you, Carlos!
Keep that shit over there on your side!

41:49.200 --> 41:51.328
- Take the Yankee with you!
- I'll go with you!

41:51.480 --> 41:53.403
(IN SPANISH ACCENT)
Hey, I don't want him.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.244
He's a negro lover. You take him.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.801
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Motherfucker! Say something else, bro!

41:57.960 --> 42:01.282
(IN SPANISH ACCENT) Hey! Hey, I swear to God.
I swear to God, I'll cut you, ése.

42:01.440 --> 42:04.171
- Let's just shake hands.
- There is no shaking hands, gringo.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.810
- Friendship.
- Go back where you belong.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.240
I don't know where I belong.

42:07.400 --> 42:10.165
(IN FEMININE VOICE)
Leave him alone. I'll keep him.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.484
You belong with me.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.650
- Who are you?
- I'm Dante.

42:15.040 --> 42:18.089
Why don't you leave him alone, Carlos!
Leave him alone, Leroy!

42:18.240 --> 42:20.527
- Are you a woman?
- I am if you want me to be.

42:20.920 --> 42:21.967
I don't want that.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.561
- Okay, I know what you are.
- Let me hold your pocket.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.688
- Let me hold your pocket.
- All right.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.163
I claimed him! He mine, Leroy!

42:30.320 --> 42:33.722
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Bitch, you got two seconds
to let his fucking pocket go. Two!

42:33.880 --> 42:36.167
- Motherfucker! You got two seconds!
- Don't hit a woman!

42:36.360 --> 42:38.124
- Gonna knock your ass out!
- Don't hit a woman!

42:38.320 --> 42:39.606
(IN FEMININE VOICE)
You don't want my pocket.

42:39.760 --> 42:42.331
You don't want it. So what?
Why can't I be happy?

42:43.120 --> 42:47.330
(IN SPANISH ACCENT) Hey, ése. I don't like you
and this domestic shit in front of my crew.

42:47.480 --> 42:48.527
You think I like it?

42:48.680 --> 42:51.160
You need to fucking take it
somewhere else, ése, huh?

42:51.320 --> 42:53.322
Gringo, you take you
and your dirty bitch elsewhere.

42:53.480 --> 42:56.086
- I'll go over there.
- (IN FEMININE VOICE) Don't call me dirty.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.130
I wasn't dirty when you was up in it.
I wasn't dirty then, was I?

42:59.880 --> 43:02.008
(IN SPANISH ACCENT)
You were dirty then. You're dirty now.

43:02.520 --> 43:05.364
- (IN FEMININE VOICE) He ain't complaining.
- You should get tested.

43:05.720 --> 43:09.361
No, I'm not complaining because
we have yet to have any sort of interaction.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.688
- Tonight will be our night.
- No. Tonight won't happen.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.968
- Be my white knight. Save me.
- Don't get your hopes up.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.168
Let me ride you.
Let me ride you into safety.

43:16.360 --> 43:20.729
No! I don't feel comfortable with that.
Let go of me! Leroy is going to be upset.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.806
- I knew you were coming back.
- (IN NORMAL VOICE) Motherfucker!

43:23.960 --> 43:25.405
I knew you were coming back.

43:25.560 --> 43:27.483
You making me mad, motherfucker!

43:27.800 --> 43:30.246
- I'm not doing anything!
- I'm about to whoop your ass, white boy!

43:30.680 --> 43:33.570
- I'm just standing here.
- No, you not. You got my bitch!

43:33.720 --> 43:35.848
- Trying to figure out a place...
- (IN FEMININE VOICE) I'm your old bitch.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.047
We're like zebras.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.965
- We're not like a zebra.
- We are like a zebra. You're my...

43:40.120 --> 43:44.205
Somehow you're getting me to hug you,
and I don't know how that's happening.

43:44.400 --> 43:49.042
(SPANISH ACCENT) That's it! That's it, gringo.
I'm getting sick of this shit. I'll stab you.

43:49.240 --> 43:52.687
I'm still confused as to what piece
you are in this puzzle, Carlos.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.651
Hold on! Hold on. Question, question.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.325
Are there any French gangs?

43:58.360 --> 44:00.522
I speak French.
I'm not fluent, but I can...

44:01.760 --> 44:04.604
(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)

44:04.760 --> 44:06.888
(IN ENGLISH)
Can I join the gang, s'il vous plaît?

44:07.600 --> 44:10.490
(IN NORMAL VOICE) You know what?
You can't fight. Since you can't fight...

44:10.640 --> 44:13.962
I'm left with one choice,
and that's to get your stupid ass in shape.

44:14.120 --> 44:16.248

40 feet away.

44:20.040 --> 44:21.644
Ain't no gyms in San Quentin.

Curl me, bitch! Curl me!

44:25.720 --> 44:28.451
Maybe I should start with a baby
at higher reps.

44:29.720 --> 44:31.848
Hey! Hey, you!

44:32.640 --> 44:34.802
- I wanna fight you.
- What'd you say, dickhead?

I wanna fight you, asshole.

Tell me how you gonna escape San Quentin.
Stop wasting my time, James.

46:35.440 --> 46:40.480
That's what happens when you try
to jump a fence illegally. Hm?

46:49.480 --> 46:51.209
Your training's not going well, man.

46:51.360 --> 46:54.125
Frankly, I don't feel like
you're giving me 100 percent.

46:54.360 --> 46:57.170
And as your incarceration expert,
that concerns me.

46:57.360 --> 46:59.408
Because it's my job to prepare you.

47:02.240 --> 47:04.447
Oh, thank God. Oh, that's good.

47:05.200 --> 47:08.170
- You're gonna learn how to suck dick.
- What?!

47:09.480 --> 47:10.891
Oh, God.

47:11.360 --> 47:13.886
Listen up. I said I want you
to learn how to suck dick.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.565
I heard you!

47:16.560 --> 47:17.891
- That's your plan?
- Yes.

47:18.040 --> 47:21.726
All I'm saying is that when life puts a dick
in your mouth, you make dickade.

47:21.880 --> 47:25.202
"Dickade" doesn't sound like
a significant improvement over dick.

47:25.400 --> 47:28.006
Bottom line, James!
I know what I'm talking about.

47:28.160 --> 47:30.401
- We're talking about survival.
- I understand.

47:30.720 --> 47:35.362
- Because that's how you survived. Right?
- No, you shut your mouth. No, it is not.

47:35.720 --> 47:36.846
I survived with these.

- No. No! I kill with these.

- There you go! Just dive in!

48:14.080 --> 48:16.003
- That's what they do.
- What if someone says no?

48:16.200 --> 48:18.601
He ain't gonna say no.
It's a scientific fact.

48:18.760 --> 48:19.841
According to who?

48:20.040 --> 48:22.122
Dickapedia! Why do you care?

48:22.280 --> 48:25.966
- Is that a real site?
- No. James, it's a... Get up.

48:26.120 --> 48:29.442
You're gonna go to that bar.
That guy. That guy right there.

48:29.600 --> 48:33.446
Get up, go over there, and politely ask
that man can you suck his dick.

48:33.720 --> 48:36.451
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe I'm about to do this.

48:36.680 --> 48:38.045
Survival.

48:38.680 --> 48:40.125
Go survive.

48:40.800 --> 48:43.121
All right. I'll just go do it.

48:43.280 --> 48:44.805
Yes, go do it.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.007
JAMES: Okay.

48:50.160 --> 48:52.128
MAN:
Come on. Are we doing this or not, okay?

48:52.320 --> 48:53.970
JAMES: Yes, we're definitely doing it.

48:55.160 --> 48:57.640
Hey, I was nervous the first time
I did karaoke, right?

48:58.320 --> 48:59.685
Just get up there and sing.

49:00.480 --> 49:02.403
This is terrible foreplay. Come on.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.210
- I'm gonna put it in my mouth.
- Yeah.

49:04.360 --> 49:07.330
I'm gonna suck your di... Your di...

49:07.480 --> 49:08.970
I'm gonna suck your di...

49:09.120 --> 49:10.406
That's what we're here for.

49:10.560 --> 49:13.848
I'll gonna put your di... in my mouth.
I'm gonna give you he...

49:14.040 --> 49:15.166
Facial.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.927
Down the hatch! Heh.

49:23.760 --> 49:24.841
Eating alone?

49:26.160 --> 49:28.162
I just thought you could use
some company.

49:28.360 --> 49:30.249
Oh... Oh.

49:30.520 --> 49:31.726
Okay, I see what this is.

49:32.760 --> 49:35.001
You think that you can get with me?

49:35.200 --> 49:40.366
- Interesting topic of conversation.
- Wait. No. That wasn't a sit-down invitation.

49:41.600 --> 49:44.729
- You're like a 6.
- Thank you.

49:45.200 --> 49:49.285
No, it's not a compliment.
That's not a good number. I'm like a 9.

49:49.680 --> 49:51.808
If I were to get into this game...

49:52.880 --> 49:54.291
- You know, the gay game...
- Uh-huh.

49:54.480 --> 49:57.086
By the way,
the gay game is a game you can win.

49:57.240 --> 50:00.881
No, it's not, because I don't wanna play.
I'm saying "if."

50:01.040 --> 50:03.566
There's a spot on the bench for you,
if you decide to join.

50:03.720 --> 50:05.609
No, I'm not on the bench, man.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.364
Okay, starter! Heh.

50:07.560 --> 50:08.766
I'm not gay, man.

50:08.920 --> 50:12.925
I'm here, supporting a friend,
doing some gay stuff.

50:13.080 --> 50:16.926
I'm sorry. My name is Chris. It's short
for Christmas Came Early This Year.

50:21.400 --> 50:23.084
Where are you at, man?

50:23.640 --> 50:24.721
MAN: Come on, man.

50:24.880 --> 50:26.882
This is gonna help me in the long run.

50:27.080 --> 50:29.924
- Here. Right there.
- Don't point it at me.

50:30.960 --> 50:32.928
Hey! Have fun with it, right?

50:33.080 --> 50:34.570
- Have fun with it.
- Yeah.

50:34.720 --> 50:37.371
- Come on.
- Three, two, one! In the mouth!

50:50.520 --> 50:51.521
(YELLS)

50:51.680 --> 50:53.808
Look, you're gonna
find you someone, man.

50:53.960 --> 50:57.043
You just gotta set your sights
on something more realistic, you know?

50:57.280 --> 51:00.011
You gotta think long-term.
Think about the relationship.

51:00.440 --> 51:02.681
Who are you gonna raise
that Chinese baby with?

51:02.840 --> 51:04.683
- I don't know.
- Hm?

51:04.840 --> 51:08.128
Who are you gonna restore
that Airstream camper with?

51:08.280 --> 51:12.046
Who are you gonna drive and open
that bed-and-breakfast in New Hampshire with?

51:12.240 --> 51:14.925
- This is what I need to hear.
- Yes! Yes.

51:15.080 --> 51:19.881
I can't do it. I really tried.
I just can't! You have to train me.

51:20.200 --> 51:21.247
It's my last chance.

51:21.400 --> 51:23.402
You ready to train harder
than you've ever trained?

51:23.640 --> 51:26.007
Because once we go, we do not hold back.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.685
We do it! And we do it hard!

51:27.840 --> 51:29.080
Are you ready to get hard?

51:29.240 --> 51:30.890
I am ready. I'm ready to get hard!

51:31.040 --> 51:33.247
- You're gonna show me you can get hard!
- I'm gonna show you!

51:33.440 --> 51:35.727
I'm gonna get so hard!
Because I'm gonna show you how hard!

51:35.880 --> 51:38.850
That's what I wanna hear.
Then let's go home and get hard.

51:48.040 --> 51:50.202
I want what they have.

51:51.680 --> 51:53.045
Yeah!

51:53.200 --> 51:54.690
Yeah, James!

51:54.880 --> 51:55.927
Yeah!

51:59.920 --> 52:01.410
- Unh!
- DARNELL: Yeah!

52:01.560 --> 52:02.971
That's what I'm talking about!

52:03.200 --> 52:05.043
- Ugh.
- Sho' enough!

52:05.520 --> 52:08.251
Fear of dick-sucking
will give a man strength.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.085
Fuck you.

52:14.240 --> 52:15.969
Fuck cock!

52:16.480 --> 52:17.561
Shit!

52:17.720 --> 52:22.681
Hey, back off! You better get those tits
out of my face! Or I'll show you my tits!

52:22.840 --> 52:25.491
- What are you doing?
- Working on my trash talk.

52:25.680 --> 52:27.682
You know, to get respect
from the other inmates.

52:28.080 --> 52:29.445
Let me hear some of it.

52:30.440 --> 52:32.488
All right. Ahem.

52:33.480 --> 52:36.404
Hey, pal. I'm about
to tear you a new ass.

52:37.400 --> 52:39.801
You gonna have to do a little better
than that, James.

52:40.400 --> 52:42.448
Hey, I'm about to tear you a new ass.

52:42.600 --> 52:44.602
And sew up your old ass!

52:45.240 --> 52:46.685
Okay. All right.

52:46.840 --> 52:48.842
I'm gonna punch you in the fuck!

52:49.000 --> 52:51.082
I'm gonna make you my bitch's bitch!

52:51.240 --> 52:53.641
You're gonna be my grand-bitch!

52:53.840 --> 52:57.208
Yeah. You're about to 20 likes
on Instafuck.

52:58.240 --> 53:01.084
If I see you around here again,
I'm gonna put a hashtag on your ass.

53:01.280 --> 53:03.408
And see how many hits it gets.

53:03.720 --> 53:05.484
- Hmm?
- Oh, my God.

53:05.640 --> 53:08.928
Hope you brought your Costco card,
because you're about to get dick in bulk!

53:09.280 --> 53:11.089
What? This is so dark.

53:11.240 --> 53:14.210
How does a prix fixe dinner
of five courses of dick sound?

53:14.360 --> 53:16.328
- You eat organic?
- What?

53:16.480 --> 53:20.451
How about fresh farm-to-table,
a purée of my balls!

53:20.600 --> 53:25.128
Yeah. Merry Dickmas, Santa Cock! Hmm?

53:25.440 --> 53:26.771
Okay. All right, man.

53:26.920 --> 53:28.490
Where is this stuff coming from, James?

53:28.720 --> 53:31.849
Hey, son.
You're a disappointment to your parents.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.411
Who I fucked!

53:33.600 --> 53:34.840
Oh, shit.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.765
James, this is sick.
You gotta be crazy to think of this.

53:38.280 --> 53:39.770
That crazy is good.

53:39.920 --> 53:42.605
Thank you.
I've got about six hours more.

53:42.760 --> 53:45.081
That's good, James. That's really good.

53:46.280 --> 53:48.601
I like that. I like that a lot.

53:49.240 --> 53:53.325
I hope you brought your dick punch-card
because the eighth dick is free.

53:53.480 --> 53:54.720
Stab!

53:55.280 --> 53:57.169
Shit! Okay.

53:57.800 --> 53:59.131
That's not bad, James.

53:59.720 --> 54:01.609
That's not bad at all.

54:02.120 --> 54:03.281
Progress.

54:10.120 --> 54:13.681
Peter piper picked a peck
of pickled cocks!

54:15.840 --> 54:16.966
Yes.

54:23.080 --> 54:26.368
Hey, hey, hey!
You ready to get to work today?

54:28.200 --> 54:29.645
Huh?

54:29.800 --> 54:32.371
- Hello.
- What's all this stuff?

54:32.640 --> 54:34.130
Oh, these are shanks.

54:34.280 --> 54:35.725
Or "shivs."

54:35.920 --> 54:38.969
In Scotland,
they're referred to as "chibs."

54:40.360 --> 54:43.170
In fact, I made this one for you.

54:44.680 --> 54:46.284
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:46.960 --> 54:49.531
Just to say thank you
for all the hard work.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.167
Oh, man.

54:52.920 --> 54:54.445
That's nice. That's cool.

54:54.640 --> 54:59.328
Whoa, whoa. Don't hold it by the blade.
Haven't you ever held one before? Right here.

54:59.840 --> 55:02.730
Yeah, no, my cellie
used to hold them all the time.

55:02.880 --> 55:04.962
I don't like them.
They cause too much trouble.

55:05.120 --> 55:07.771
You pull that out on the yard, somebody
come out attack you, they can do this to you.

55:07.920 --> 55:09.968
Now what do you do?
You know what I mean?

55:10.600 --> 55:12.329
(GRUNTS)

55:12.680 --> 55:14.808
What the hell? Where'd that come from?

55:14.960 --> 55:16.291
I taught myself how to keister.

55:17.360 --> 55:20.284
How to keister? Up the keister?

55:20.440 --> 55:23.444
Look, the electronic toothbrush part,
it still works.

55:23.600 --> 55:26.171
Oh, no. Okay, James. Cut it off.

55:26.640 --> 55:28.324
Cut it off. Get it out of my face, man.

55:28.480 --> 55:29.925
I can turn it on with no hands.

55:30.080 --> 55:32.367
I don't want to see that.
I don't want to see that trick.

55:32.520 --> 55:34.363
It's okay. Put it back. God.

55:34.520 --> 55:36.249
- Put it back?
- No. No, no.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.323
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Please.

55:38.520 --> 55:41.091
- Do you want me to teach you how?
- No, I'm gonna pass on that.

55:41.240 --> 55:43.129
It starts with a simple inverse inhale.

55:43.280 --> 55:44.361
(INHALING DEEPLY)

55:45.320 --> 55:46.367
James, stop it.

55:46.520 --> 55:49.126
That, with a simultaneous
relaxing of the sphincter.

55:49.480 --> 55:51.005
I don't wanna know.

55:51.200 --> 55:52.406
You sure?

55:52.560 --> 55:55.609
I'm positive.
I just wanna ask you one question.

55:55.760 --> 55:59.606
I was over there,
and I was touching all those shanks.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.411
Were they, uh...?

56:03.320 --> 56:05.721
- Keistered?
- Yeah. Were they keistered?

56:07.360 --> 56:09.522
Most of them. Yeah.

56:19.760 --> 56:21.330
We're about to simulate a prison riot.

56:21.520 --> 56:23.966
Understand that this is
the most dangerous situation there is.

56:24.120 --> 56:26.202
Prisoners are scared. Guards are scared.

56:26.400 --> 56:29.165
The key to surviving
is to not freak out.

56:29.360 --> 56:33.251
- Good Lord. What's gonna happen?
- Cecelio's just gonna throw some stuff at you.

56:33.400 --> 56:35.846
Some roosters, some mangly
homeless guys, whatever he's got.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.970
- He's really excited about this.
- Okay. Let's do it.

56:39.160 --> 56:40.605
Wait, don't I get body armor?

56:40.760 --> 56:43.081
No. We don't have that type of time.
Cecelio!

56:43.240 --> 56:44.765
Why don't we have enough time?

56:44.960 --> 56:47.088
Remember, do not freak out.

56:47.240 --> 56:48.366
Lights!

56:48.520 --> 56:49.567

DARNELL: Cecelio! Release the chickens!

56:56.720 --> 56:58.722
No, no, no, James! Don't freak out!

56:58.880 --> 57:00.450
JAMES: Darnell, there's a baboon!

57:01.640 --> 57:03.244
- DARNELL: You're in my world now!
- Aah!

Someone let me out!

Turn it off!

57:25.840 --> 57:26.966
Turn it off!

57:27.120 --> 57:28.645
James, I've lost control!

57:28.840 --> 57:32.526
Cecelia! Pull back! I have lost control!

57:33.600 --> 57:35.170
Oh, my God!

- No!

- No, you cut me, man!

57:41.720 --> 57:42.926
You stabbed me!

57:43.080 --> 57:44.161
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did!

57:44.320 --> 57:48.120
I told you, don't freak out!
You freaked out! God! Wait...

- Hold up.

- What? It's a...

Oh.

- Oh, that's where the other one went.
- Okay, just sit down.

58:03.400 --> 58:05.482
- It's a shiv. It's just a shiv.
- Yes, I know.

58:05.640 --> 58:06.880
Hey, don't freak out.

It's like a fishhook. The more you pull,
the deeper it lodges.

Let's get you to my wife. Okay?

It's sticking right out of my head.

58:28.480 --> 58:31.962
James, listen. I don't want to look at it
no more because I'm starting to...

58:32.120 --> 58:33.565
Oh, shit. I'm so scared.

58:33.720 --> 58:35.961
I know. Can you fucking
just keep your head...

58:36.400 --> 58:37.731
Ow!

I tell you what:

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.170
Humor me.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:20.004
I'm a fair person.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.844

- How does a million dollars sound?
- Ha-ha-ha.

"How does a million dollars sound?"
Ha-ha-ha.

Hold up, everybody.
Stand back. I'll handle it.

How does a million dollars sound?

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.049
Million dollars sound like a one with six zeros
behind it with two commas separating them.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.443
However, from the sound of CNN
and the looks of The Wall Street Journal...

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.042
Which forces me to ask the question,
"Are you fucking with me?"

You think this a motherfucking game?
You think I'm playing?

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.922
Why would you come up
in my hood, in my house...

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:13.641

offering shit you can't deliver?

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.280
- Did this motherfucker tell you to lie to me?
- Russ.

Shut the fuck up, man.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.003

what the fuck you gonna do...

to the Nexel Fund is 5 million...

a brokerage pocket account.

In other words, liquidate two bricks
of cocaine and park it right here.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.964
With the historical performance of the fund,
that's gonna double every three to five years...

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.727
and we're looking at,
mm, $1.2 million easy.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.929

without committing a crime.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:05.971
No. What we're gonna do
is we get other people's money...

on the market.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.961
Okay, we gonna roll on them
and take they money.

are these loser motherfuckers?

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.330
Oh, I wouldn't worry.

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.528
I've taken millions from them...

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.490

Ain't no "kind of." They are.

I'm giving you a free pass right now.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.245
What?! You can't see the irony
in being mad at me about that?

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:44.124
- No!
- WOMAN: Motherfuckers!

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.441
(JAMES & DARNELL SCREAMING)

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.967
- It's Nazi titties!
- And they're huge!

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:53.611
Get out!

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.567
Oh, shit!

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.722
- WOMAN: Whoa!
- DARNELL: Bitch, get your white ass off!

01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.281
Goddamn it! Ugh!

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.371
JAMES: Oh, go, go, go!

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.044
- You blew up my club, Jew Hair!
- Oh, shit!

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.009
JAMES: Post-racial America, assholes!

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.686
- DARNELL: Fuck you, Nazis!
- JAMES: Yeah!

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.526
JAMES: I'm so glad to be back
in Crenshaw where it's safe.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.800
My heart is just now finally settling.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.645
Yeah. We're alive.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.247
How about we make a toast
to escaping fucking Nazis.

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.368
Yes. Heh.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.609
You really are innocent, aren't you?

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:40.801
Yes.

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.642
- Absolutely.
- Okay, so James, if that's the case...

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:46.366
then why aren't you trying to find
the guy that framed you?

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.124
We are.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.800
Who are?

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.087
Now, Martin has a team of investigators
working around the clock.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.847
He's keeping me up to date.
But the million-dollar question is:

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.083
- Who falsified my transaction records?
- All right, lay it on me.

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.811
All right. Now, this is very complicated
to follow.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:07.442
I don't expect you to get it on
the first pass, so listen very carefully.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.080
The one thing you need to understand
at the Wealthrop Fund...

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.931
is that everything flows through Martin.

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.525
- Okay?
- Okay

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.365
Any sort of contact
with the clearing house, the traders...

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.330
access to trading records
and client information...

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.482
international accounts, institutions...

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:27.168
and, of course, the doling out
of commissions all goes through Martin.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.723
- So it's Martin.
- No.

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:33.486
Are you fucking ki...?
It's common sense, James.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:36.809
Look! All arrows point to Martin!

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.725
The only name on the board
is fucking Martin!

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.241
Martin! Martin! Martin!

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.441
Come on! James, you need to focus.

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.046
You're going to prison
unless you can prove that Martin did it.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.089
We'd need to get a hold
of the master records...

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.045
which is a log of all transactions
made by anyone in the firm.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.891
- Okay, how do we get it?
- Martin has the original copy...

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.805
on the same computer that he had
when he started the company.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:00.566
You got to be the dumbest genius I've...
Get up, James!

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.728
- All right.
- Fuck the board! Let's go, James!

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.410
We're going to Martin's office.

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.249
Act natural, James.
You walking like you guilty.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.882
- Hey, big guy, you catch the game?
- Yeah.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.884
Hey, big guy, my name is Ken.
I work here.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.640
(BOTH SHUSHING)

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.845
(WHISPERING) It's in this cabinet.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.970
We just have to figure out a way
to get the door open.

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.610
Watch out.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.441
I got it.

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:41.561
Ugh. There it is. Same computer he had
when he started the company.

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:42.767
It's a good luck charm.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.206
Good luck charm, my ass.

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:48.365
It has no connection to the outside world.
No emails, no internet, no trace.

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.967
JAMES: There it is. The master records.

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.771
That's what we need.
This will clear my name.

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.684
Well, then let's not waste time. Get it.

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.771
Yes! I'm not going to prison.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.482
More importantly,
I'm not gonna be anyone's bitch.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.802
Hey, you are living
the dream, my friend.

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.923
- Darnell?
- Yeah?

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.320
Look, you saved my life.

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.530
- I don't know how I'll ever repay you.
- Oh, come on, man.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.206
Just this once.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.767
(CHUCKLES)

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.691
MAN: All right, break it up.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:28.241
Leave the cart there and back away.
Move away, come on. Move, move.

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:32.050
I actually respect you for trying,
but enough is enough, James.

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.687
All right.

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.371
What are you doing?

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.491
James, what are you doing?

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.841
DARNELL: Don't mad-dog, James.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.001
(GROWLING)

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.731
He's gonna shoot us.

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.480
What the fuck?!

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.687
(BARKING)

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:48.921
No. He's gonna kill us, man.

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.003
- Do you want some?!
- Oh, fuck!

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:52.889
- Do you wanna step with me?!
- God!

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.407
You'd better... Don't...

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.087
(GRUNTING)

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:57.327
DARNELL: Oh.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.005
The gun! Grab the gun!

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:01.168
- Huh?
- Why don't you pick up the gun!

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.367
Uh...

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.090
- Grab it!
- Yeah. I got it, I got it!

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:06.602
I got it. Yeah, I got it.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.171
You look a little nervous.
First time holding a gun?

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.647
Nope.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.281
Motherfucker, freeze!

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.164
Before I pop yo ass!

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.481
"Pop"? Really?

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.251
I would listen to him.
This man's a dangerous felon.

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.001
Yeah, except when I ran his record,
it was the cleanest one I'd ever seen.

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.006
Not even a parking ticket.

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:29.768
- Yeah.
- What?

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.446
You didn't know? Yeah.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.683
Stop dicking around and give me the gun.
Come on. Give me the gun.

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.565
I think you have the safety on.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.525
Shit! Ow.

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:42.166
Ugh.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.527
See? Safety's on.

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.287
Safety off.

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.246
Martin was right.
You are a lucky little shit.

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:58.285
Don't give me reason to find you again.
Either of you.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.688
Don't you mad-dog me, James.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:11.128
Listen, listen,
I got some explaining to do. James!

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.851
We can talk about this
after we go catch this guy.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.047
You traitor!

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.646
- "Traitor"?
- Everything you taught me was a lie!

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.929
And now I'm fucked
beyond all fucktitude!

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:23.163
My life's asshole is fucked!

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.130
You stop with your unorthodox style
of cussing!

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.845
You just remember:

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.169
Whatever happens to me in there,
it's your fault!

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.845
Oh, stop. That's bullshit, man.

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.681
Okay, I may have lied to you about going
to jail, but I did my job. I got you ready!

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.927
Ready for what?!

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.171
Maximum-bullshit prison?

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.682
I almost sucked a dick because of you!

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.051
I don't even give a shit.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.929
It's my sign.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:04.682
Now, the great thing about an IRA, if you need
the money for education or a first home...

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.366
motherfuckers can make withdrawal
penalty-free.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.804
I honestly don't get the difference
between Roth and the traditional IRAs.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.924
Fuck is wrong with you?
The shit is pretax.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.647
No, it's okay.
A lot of people get confused by that.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.729
This bitch is gonna mess around,
get us audited.

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.526
- Say what you mean.
- You got five years' receipts, motherfucker?

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.644
And the strip club ain't no home office!

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.529
That's a red flag, nigga!

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.485
You big beanbag-build bitch!

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.881
Stop it! You all friends! Right?

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.000
Now JoJo, you might be right.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.889
A strip club isn't a home office.

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.724
You're asking to be audited, son.

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:44.287
But is being right more important
than friendship? Huh?

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.365
Take it from me.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.449
I lost my black friend.

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:50.125
Don't lose yours.

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.321
Hug.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.402
Hug, motherfuckers!

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.848
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, man.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.083
- I'll love you forever.
- Hey, bro, you know, it's just talk.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.443
Say, cos, you ready to get
put on the hood?

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:06.284
I'm rolling.

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.410
(ALL CHEERING)

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.609
RUSSELL: Mayo, I need you
to sink your mind into this, cos.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:21.683
Once you step through this threshold,
motherfuckers are ready to kill for you.

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.765
I mean a whole fraternity
of motherfuckers gonna have your back.

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.969
But there's only one way out of this.

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.731
That's when your casket
drops into the ground.

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.720
So from this day forward...

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.802
you have eternal protection...

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.170
until your eternal demise.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.522
We dead-ass serious about what we do.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.004
And if you go through that threshold
and you make it back...

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:48.401
we gonna be dead-ass serious about you.

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.164
Time to smoke some fools.

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.482
Crenshaw Kings for life, motherfucker.

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.762
Hmm. Almost.

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.320
Let's roll.

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.087
SHONDA: Hey.

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.720
You come back safe.

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.365
I will, Shonda.

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.606
- MAN: We gotta go, Mayo.
- Bye, baby.

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.171
RUSSELL: Let's roll, cos.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.521
(SCREAMS)

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.808
Hold up! Oh, shit! Wait, wait, wait!

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.405
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.325
Hey! It's Darnell! It's Darnell!

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:22.205
- It's Darnell!
- What the fuck are you doing here?

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.687
Shit, cousin!
Man, tell them to put their guns down!

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.530
Man, put them up.

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.567
DARNELL: God!

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.331
What is your problem, man?
What are you doing?

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.720
Man, give us a second.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.087
I'm blooding in. Crenshaw Kings
are gonna protect me on the inside.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.165
So you're gonna go and kill somebody, James?
Huh? Have you lost your fucking mind?

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.363
I have to. I don't have a choice.

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.681
That is not true.

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:49.606
I came here to tell you
we can clear your name, James.

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.330
But you gotta trust me, man.

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.845
We gotta roll, Mayo.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.331
"Mayo"?

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:58.404
- Who the fuck is Mayo?
- I'm Mayo. It's my gang name.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:01.524
It's short for "Mayonnaise"
on account of my skin color.

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.921
I came up with that.

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.249
- Okay, you wanna go then?
- What?

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.845
- You wanna go?
- What are you doing?

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.129
Putting fingerprints on your gun.
If you go to jail, I'm going to jail with you.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:14.644
So before you out there and make a stupid-ass
decision, why don't you think about that?

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.247
There you go.

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.207
That's it? My fingerprints
are off that easy?

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.044
Pretty much. Good as new.
Let's roll, Mayo.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:28.041
James, you got a choice right now. You got
the right path, you got the wrong path.

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.804
Make the right decision, James.

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.889
Follow your heart, man.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:35.642
James, you gotta trust me on this one.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.286
Oh, my God! I almost did it!
I almost killed a man!

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.090
And I was gonna use this gun.

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.965
James, put that away, man! Stop!

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.367
(PANTING)

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.965
- What is your problem?
- I don't know.

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.930
They were just encouraging me...

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.525
and they were high-fiving me.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.643
They're passing me this sticky icky.

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.361
And between the pot and the hos...

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.727
it was just an ambrosia
of primal sensations.

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.965
And for one brief moment,
I knew what my purpose was.

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.248
- Okay, okay.
- Not to mention Russell.

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:19.928
He's so charismatic. Real natural leader.
Reminds me of a young Ronald Reagan.

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.480
Hey...

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:25.048
Thank you for coming back for me.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:30.442
Thanks for not doing nothing stupid, man.
Let's get out of here.

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:43.811
All right, so listen to this.

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:46.611
I figured out that the residue
on Martin's car was saltwater.

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:50.207
Then I remembered the mileage. I used to
take a picture of the odometer all the time...

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:53.847
- ...to keep people from accusing me of joyriding.
- People do that? That's awful.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.005
Yeah, you did it like three times. You tried to
get me fired, but thought my name was Andre.

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.204
Anyway, Martin used to drive
the same exact seven miles every day.

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:04.443
But last week, he started driving
56 miles every day.

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.410
Fifty-six! So, what I did was,
I checked the map.

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.723
Turns out that's the exact distance
of a round-trip to San Pedro.

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.491
Saltwater, ocean, San Pedro.

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:17.486
I just gotta figure out why he's going to
San Pedro. That's the only thing I don't know.

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:19.409
His yacht.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.931
It's docked at the port.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.890
- Fucker's got a yacht?
- Mm-hm. And an island in Cape Verde...

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:27.806
- ...where there are no extradition laws.
- Fucker's got a yacht and a island, James?

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:30.361
Fucking working for a villain
in a James Bond movie!

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.809
He's gonna make a run for it.

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.004
Not if Mayo can stop him.

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.888
Mayo and Chocolat.

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.849
- "Chocolat"?
- Chocolat.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.288
- Is that supposed to be my nickname?
- That's your nickname.

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:49.241
I'll do better.
We have the whole car ride.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.522
Mayo and Coffee.

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.364
Mayo and Fudge.

- JAMES: Hit it, Fudge!

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:11.607
There it is. There's his boat.
The Sea Note.

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.406

- Are those guards?
- I think so.

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.371
- DARNELL: There's a lot of them.
- JAMES: Yeah.

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:28.607
There's the computer.

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:31.406

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.881
that's got dogs that can swim. Let me
tell you something about swimming dogs.

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.646
Now, let me tell you,
you're gonna bullshit a bullshitter...

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:47.768
just make the bullshit plausible.

01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:50.810
MAN: This is the U.S. Marshall Service.
Prepare to be boarded.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.570
You are carrying a fugitive.

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.405
Yes!

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:56.607
Heh. Hell yeah.

01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.000
Oh, shit.

01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:00.287
How?

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.404
Remember this bracelet
that crooked lawyer of yours gave me?

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:07.962
By my calculation we should be well
outside the county line.

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.922
Prison school's in session, bitch.

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.803
And somebody just graduated.

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.450
That's perfect. That's perfect.

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.931
That's great, right?

01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:19.560
Attention Sea Note.
This is the U.S. Marshal Service.

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:22.240
- DARNELL: Where you going? Huh, Martin?
- JAMES: Where you going?

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:23.931
What?!

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:25.764
- Look at you, man!
- I know.

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.160
God, look at you!

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:30.802
Where did you put...? That was in your ass.
That was in your ass.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.442
JAMES:
The computer proved I was innocent.

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:37.650
Martin was arrested for fraud, tampering
with evidence and obstruction of justice.

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:40.724
ALISSA: And I will be contacting
my attorney. Daddy?

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.680
JAMES: As for me, I was cleared
of all charges related to the embezzlement.

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.285
So I guess we did it.

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.090
Mayo and Chocolate.

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:51.164
Thank God we won't
be needing this anymore.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.283
This illegal, unlicensed gun.

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:56.444
- Okay, you should really get rid of that thing.
- MAN: Gun!

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.644
- MAN: Drop it!
- Oh, shit.

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.082
JAMES: I did end up getting six months
for carrying an unlicensed weapon.

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:05.924
(GATE BUZZES)

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.844
But, thanks to Darnell, I was ready.

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:11.650
Prison is like life distilled
to its purest form.

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:14.690
Give respect to get respect.

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:23.441
But most of all, if you let someone fuck
with your food, you're a punk fuck bitch.

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.851
Someone should have told you
this Mayo went bad.

01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:28.809
I'm gonna punch you in the fuck!

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.126
I'm gonna shit you!

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.408
Merry Dickmas, Santa Cock!

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:37.562
Martin didn't do as well.
But he learned a valuable lesson too.

01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:42.003
They be fucking in San Quentin.

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.162
- How ya doing?
- JAMES: A whole lot of fucking.

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:45.367
Hey! Open up. Open up.

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:53.286
JAMES: Shonda visited me every day.

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:57.129
I never thought prison would be the place
I learned to love again...

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.924
but that's what happened.

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:02.801
No, no, no! She's not done.
She hasn't finished yet.

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.561
No, it's not what you think.
We're in love.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:10.603
JAMES: I helped the FBI find and return
all the assets Martin stole.

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:15.607
In return, they unfroze my bank accounts,
and I knew just where to invest my money.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.286
DARNELL: It's good?

01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:26.801
It's good, right?

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.883
Makayla, you proud of Daddy?

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.963
Daddy did good? Give me a hug.

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:37.008
Daddy, I like your car wash.

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.128
I'm glad you like it, sweetie.

01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:59.164
I see you survived.

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.209
I guess you got hard, Mayo.

01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:03.926
No. You made me hard.

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.487
Come here, man. Heh.

01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:07.966
Aah!

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.929
You made me hard.

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.170
So hard.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.085
You got me so hard.

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.084
I'm happy to see you too, big fella.
I'm happy to see you.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.766
There was a moment
where I stopped being hard...

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:24.288
but I thought of you,
and it got me hard again.

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.849
And I can't ever thank you.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.161
All right.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:32.450
Welcome home, man.
Come on, let's get in the car.

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:34.244
You look good, James.

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:42.889
Welcome back to the free world, James.
How you wanna celebrate?

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:46.886
JAMES: You know what I'd like to get
my hands on? A Wall Street Journal and a 40.

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.168
Now that'd be a perfect Sunday morning.

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.362
