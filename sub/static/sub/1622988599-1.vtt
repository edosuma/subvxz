02:01.750 --> 02:03.583
The legend of the "unrivaled warriors"

02:03.666 --> 02:06.916
predates the history of Huaxia.

02:08.166 --> 02:11.375
The strongest warriors

02:11.458 --> 02:14.541
absorb energy from heaven and earth,

02:15.833 --> 02:20.291
growing stronger with each battle,

02:20.375 --> 02:23.916
amassing cosmic energy
of unimaginable power.

02:31.875 --> 02:34.625
They're blessed by the heavens,

02:34.708 --> 02:38.583
born to lead armies and conquer,

02:40.958 --> 02:43.416
and change the course of the world.

02:45.708 --> 02:49.791
The "unrivaled" are the chosen ones.

03:01.291 --> 03:02.375
LUOYANG

03:09.166 --> 03:13.833
GUANGZONG

03:30.666 --> 03:32.333
HAN

03:45.125 --> 03:47.458
I, Dong Zhuo, vow to lead an army

03:48.500 --> 03:51.000
to eradicate all rebels!

03:59.500 --> 04:02.250
DONG ZHUO

04:13.375 --> 04:15.125
The Han Dynasty is dead.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.166
The Yellow Turbans will rule.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.625
From this day forth,

04:19.291 --> 04:22.916
peace and prosperity will reign!

04:23.541 --> 04:26.541
ZHANG JIAO

04:28.541 --> 04:32.583
TIANGONG GENERAL

05:37.166 --> 05:40.166
The Yellow Turbans
have cornered the troops.

05:44.375 --> 05:47.333
The rebel Zhang Jiao is here.
Let's capture him and end this quickly.

05:48.041 --> 05:49.333
It's time.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.208
My brothers,

05:52.041 --> 05:53.541
we may not have been born together,

05:53.625 --> 05:55.000
but we shall be bonded in death.

06:19.916 --> 06:22.875
LIU BEI

06:22.958 --> 06:26.333
GUAN YU

06:26.416 --> 06:28.208
ZHANG FEI

06:46.375 --> 06:47.541
-Kill!
-Kill!

06:56.583 --> 07:00.916
Kill every last Han soldier!

07:34.541 --> 07:35.500
Who is that?

08:55.208 --> 08:56.166
Who are you?

08:56.250 --> 08:57.375
Zhang Jiao.

08:57.916 --> 08:59.500
I will kill you today

09:00.000 --> 09:01.958
for the glory of the Han Dynasty.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.375
-Retreat!
-Retreat!

09:59.333 --> 10:00.666
I am Li Ru,

10:00.750 --> 10:02.833
General Dong's chief strategist.

10:02.916 --> 10:04.250
The general sends his regards.

10:04.333 --> 10:08.250
Please accept our gratitude.

10:09.291 --> 10:10.416
There's no need to thank us.

10:11.125 --> 10:13.250
General Dong is the head of the Han army.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.083
It's our duty to assist you.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.625
You're too modest.

10:17.708 --> 10:21.458
The three of you are so capable
at a young age.

10:21.541 --> 10:25.166
May I ask for your names?

10:25.875 --> 10:28.416
What are your official ranks?

10:29.791 --> 10:31.208
I'm Liu Xuande.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.791
I'm Guan Yunchang.

10:36.833 --> 10:38.250
I'm Zhang Yide.

10:39.916 --> 10:42.458
The three of us have no official ranks.

10:43.041 --> 10:45.041
We killed them on our own accord
to serve the empire.

11:33.708 --> 11:36.291
We risked our lives to save Dong Zhuo,

11:36.375 --> 11:37.791
yet he was so rude.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.541
He's an official.

11:40.958 --> 11:43.666
If they don't want us here,
let's just go somewhere else.

11:44.416 --> 11:46.791
I believe we'll be useful somewhere.

11:50.791 --> 11:52.458
We'll do as you say.

11:52.541 --> 11:53.833
Go.

11:55.041 --> 11:56.583
-Go.
-Go.

11:56.666 --> 11:58.083
Go.

13:27.666 --> 13:30.833
THE YOUNG EMPEROR OF HAN, LIU BIAN

13:46.083 --> 13:47.250
Listen carefully.

13:47.916 --> 13:51.333
I've long wanted to say this.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.500
His Majesty is the master of the citizens.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.916
He must inspire awe.

13:59.416 --> 14:01.958
Don't you agree?

14:03.791 --> 14:05.291
Otherwise,

14:05.375 --> 14:08.208
how can he rule the nation?

14:09.125 --> 14:10.666
Don't you agree?

14:17.250 --> 14:18.625
My dear Situ,

14:19.208 --> 14:22.041
as a loyal official,

14:22.625 --> 14:24.000
answer me first.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.250
Do you agree?

14:26.666 --> 14:27.875
Do I even need to ask?

14:27.958 --> 14:29.875
Of course you agree. Am I right?

14:29.958 --> 14:32.541
Dong Zhuo, you traitor. You're so bold!

14:32.625 --> 14:35.208
His Majesty is
the late emperor's legitimate son.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.666
You're committing treason.

14:37.041 --> 14:38.958
-I'd rather die than obey you!
-I'm not convinced.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.208
Me too!

14:40.708 --> 14:42.333
-Take them outside and execute them.
-You--

14:43.458 --> 14:46.541
Dong Zhuo, you traitor!

14:46.625 --> 14:48.000
You'll die a terrible death!

14:48.083 --> 14:50.166
-Dong Zhuo, you'll die a terrible death!
-So?

14:50.250 --> 14:52.083
You won't even dare to answer.

14:53.291 --> 14:55.083
How can you call yourself loyal?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.291
Do you agree?

14:58.958 --> 14:59.916
Do you agree or not?

15:00.541 --> 15:01.500
I agree.

15:04.625 --> 15:05.833
I agree!

15:05.916 --> 15:07.666
The chancellor is wise.

15:08.166 --> 15:11.291
His Majesty is too weak to rule,

15:11.791 --> 15:13.833
but Prince Chen Liu is smart and studious.

15:14.916 --> 15:16.666
I suggest that the chancellor

15:17.166 --> 15:18.541
depose His Majesty

15:20.916 --> 15:23.791
and appoint Prince Chen Liu instead.

15:41.541 --> 15:45.375
CAO CAO

15:55.333 --> 15:56.958
What's going on?

16:02.333 --> 16:04.250
-How can this be good?
-What should we do?

16:09.583 --> 16:10.666
This is ridiculous.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.916
Thank you for coming to congratulate me.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.416
Pardon me for being frank.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.500
WANG YUN

16:16.583 --> 16:19.958
The prosperous and glorious
400-year-old Han Dynasty

16:21.000 --> 16:22.916
is faced with the worst crisis.

16:24.291 --> 16:26.583
We just defeated the Yellow Turbans.

16:27.791 --> 16:30.375
Now, Dong Zhuo is stealing the empire.

16:32.333 --> 16:33.333
Your Majesty.

16:33.416 --> 16:34.875
How despicable!

16:35.375 --> 16:37.916
-He insulted His Majesty
-Move!

16:38.625 --> 16:40.166
and defiled the imperial harem.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.250
He's such an embarrassment.

16:43.958 --> 16:48.208
It's truly heart-wrenching.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.500
What a pity.

16:50.583 --> 16:51.833
-That's right.
-Yes.

16:51.916 --> 16:53.666
He's a rebel.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.083
Cao Cao, you deceiver!

17:00.708 --> 17:02.708
While everyone is mourning for the nation,

17:02.791 --> 17:03.916
why are you laughing?

17:04.916 --> 17:06.875
Don't you think it's funny?

17:07.458 --> 17:08.916
By crying right now,

17:09.500 --> 17:11.000
will you be able to defeat Dong Zhuo?

17:11.583 --> 17:13.458
In my opinion…

17:17.750 --> 17:20.250
all the gentlemen here

17:21.000 --> 17:22.208
are not men at all!

17:22.291 --> 17:24.166
How bold!

17:24.250 --> 17:26.833
Drag this foulmouthed
young minor official out!

17:28.833 --> 17:31.708
Armed Cavalry Captain,
how dare you utter such bold words!

17:31.791 --> 17:34.375
Even if my rank is not high,

17:35.333 --> 17:37.791
I dare to do what you can't!

17:39.291 --> 17:41.666
-I'm going to kill--
-Shut up! This man is insane!

17:41.750 --> 17:43.875
-Guards, drag him away--
-There's no need!

17:47.375 --> 17:48.333
I'll show myself out.

17:53.875 --> 17:57.750
You cowards can stay here and cry.

18:00.125 --> 18:03.833
XI COUNTY

18:16.916 --> 18:17.958
Have you decided?

18:18.541 --> 18:20.750
Are you paying?

18:24.375 --> 18:25.250
All right.

18:25.333 --> 18:28.541
County Commandant Liu,

18:29.375 --> 18:31.458
what is your background?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.125
I came from the line
of Prince Jing of Zhongshan.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.625
Starting from the Zhuojun District,

18:37.708 --> 18:39.916
I fought over 30 battles
with the Yellow Turbans.

18:41.291 --> 18:45.541
I earned some merits,
so I got the position of county governor.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.916
You bold thief!

18:47.000 --> 18:50.291
How dare you lie about your feats
and claim royal lineage?

18:50.375 --> 18:53.333
Now, the imperial court has given orders

18:53.833 --> 18:58.041
to punish rotten
and corrupt officials like you!

19:04.000 --> 19:05.875
-Hit him!
-Hit him!

19:05.958 --> 19:07.583
-Hit him!
-Hit him!

19:07.666 --> 19:10.125
-You dare to hit an official?
-Hit him!

19:10.625 --> 19:11.708
-Hit him!
-Hit him!

19:12.291 --> 19:13.875
-Hit him!
-Zhang Fei.

19:14.666 --> 19:15.625
Hit him!

19:16.291 --> 19:17.291
What are you doing?

19:17.375 --> 19:18.291
Liu Bei.

19:18.375 --> 19:20.208
This official is trying to frame you.

19:20.291 --> 19:23.208
Look, so many citizens
are seeking justice for you.

19:23.291 --> 19:24.833
These corrupt officers must be stopped!

19:25.583 --> 19:27.750
I'm a government official!
A government official!

19:28.333 --> 19:29.375
If you kill me,

19:29.458 --> 19:32.208
I swear all of you will die with me!
You'll die with me!

19:33.041 --> 19:34.541
My brother doesn't need this position!

19:35.250 --> 19:38.708
His good name is not be tainted
by a corrupt official like you.

19:38.791 --> 19:41.125
-Soldiers are coming!
-Run!

19:41.208 --> 19:42.250
-Run!
-My soldiers!

19:42.333 --> 19:44.500
Come and save me!

19:52.708 --> 19:54.541
Zhang Fei, don't kill them!

19:54.625 --> 19:56.583
If any of them die, I won't leave!

20:04.166 --> 20:05.041
Zhang Fei, let's go!

20:16.583 --> 20:17.583
You dare to pursue us?

20:21.083 --> 20:21.916
Go!

20:46.583 --> 20:49.125
Liu Bei, we've been traveling
for over ten days.

20:49.208 --> 20:51.333
How long before we reach Heroes Peak?

20:54.666 --> 20:57.583
We should get there
after we pass the next mountain.

20:58.625 --> 21:02.916
We'll follow you anywhere as long as
we don't associate with corrupt officials.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.250
You've suffered because of me.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.666
I refuse to serve the court

21:08.166 --> 21:10.708
while Dong Zhuo holds His Majesty hostage.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.166
I just regret saving Dong Zhuo back then.

21:18.291 --> 21:19.750
We're going to Heroes Peak

21:19.833 --> 21:23.375
to join the alliance against Dong Zhuo.

21:23.458 --> 21:27.625
Yes, let's correct our mistake and let him
meet his death according to his destiny.

22:04.625 --> 22:05.625
Liu Bei, look.

22:06.416 --> 22:08.625
Didn't we pass this place earlier?

22:10.250 --> 22:11.125
That's strange.

22:12.125 --> 22:15.250
There's something strange
about this forest.

22:15.750 --> 22:16.791
The fog is too thick.

22:18.125 --> 22:19.750
We can't tell which direction
we should go.

22:26.166 --> 22:27.666
What is this place?

22:53.041 --> 22:54.208
Is somebody there?

22:57.666 --> 22:59.125
What kind of place is this?

23:11.083 --> 23:13.291
You are all fated to come here.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.791
You should be Liu Bei,
a descendant of Prince Jing of Zhongshan,

23:17.875 --> 23:19.250
also known as Liu Xuande, right?

23:19.333 --> 23:22.375
Beside you
is your second brother, Guan Yu.

23:22.458 --> 23:24.875
On your other side is Zhang Fei, right?

23:26.958 --> 23:29.208
The heavens brought you all here.

23:29.291 --> 23:31.666
-Welcome.
-What is this place?

23:31.750 --> 23:33.958
People call it the Sword Castle.

23:34.833 --> 23:39.041
I create legendary weapons
customized for each warrior.

23:39.708 --> 23:43.458
They're all made with thousand-year-old
blood-drinking rocks.

23:44.416 --> 23:46.000
The more opponents they kill,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
the stronger the weapons become.

23:49.625 --> 23:51.958
May I ask where you're going?

23:52.750 --> 23:54.541
Why did you pass through this forest?

23:55.041 --> 23:58.833
We heard that 18 warlords will form
an alliance to depose Dong Zhuo.

23:59.333 --> 24:02.625
We wish to assist the Han Dynasty.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.208
Dong Zhuo?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.125
Dong Zhuo recruited the legendary Lu Bu

24:07.208 --> 24:09.500
to increase his military might.

24:10.333 --> 24:13.791
I heard Lu Bu has already fully developed
his unrivaled power.

24:14.666 --> 24:16.208
Anyone who goes near him

24:16.291 --> 24:18.166
will be hurt by his unrivaled power.

24:18.875 --> 24:21.041
He is invincible.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.791
Lu Bu?

24:24.500 --> 24:27.708
He was just a nobody back then.

24:28.666 --> 24:31.666
Like you, he barged in here.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
He was as cold as ice and steel.

24:35.916 --> 24:38.541
He kills people like flies
and has no ties.

24:38.625 --> 24:40.125
The people he killed

24:40.208 --> 24:43.125
didn't even have time to close their eyes
before they died.

24:43.958 --> 24:47.291
He inspires fear wherever he goes.

24:51.333 --> 24:53.958
He's an animal who lives to fight.

24:56.291 --> 24:58.833
Yet he has a handsome exterior
of a human being,

24:59.833 --> 25:01.291
both righteousness

25:01.375 --> 25:02.583
and evilness.

25:03.916 --> 25:07.208
After he took
the Heavenly Halberd from me,

25:07.291 --> 25:10.541
I heard he was recruited
by County Governor Ding Yuan.

25:10.625 --> 25:13.708
Afterward, he betrayed Ding Yuan,
who became his godfather,

25:14.416 --> 25:17.083
and worked for Dong Zhuo.

25:17.166 --> 25:18.958
DING

25:19.041 --> 25:20.958
DING YUAN

25:46.833 --> 25:48.625
Dong Zhuo is just using you!

25:48.708 --> 25:49.833
Aren't you doing the same?

25:57.958 --> 26:00.583
Fengxian, you have unrivaled power.

26:00.666 --> 26:04.000
You kill people so fast
they don't even have time to blink.

26:04.875 --> 26:05.750
Incredible.

26:06.375 --> 26:09.708
Congratulations on your promotion,
General Lu!

26:09.791 --> 26:12.375
Dong Zhuo knows how to utilize Lu Bu
better than Ding Yuan.

26:12.875 --> 26:15.916
He gave him the best horse, Red Hare,
and the strongest troops.

26:16.458 --> 26:19.708
He also gave him the honor
that warriors crave the most.

26:20.416 --> 26:21.416
How funny!

26:22.166 --> 26:24.833
How can neither virtuous
nor righteous traitors deserve

26:24.916 --> 26:26.791
the prestige of being a general?

26:28.458 --> 26:29.916
I want to challenge him

26:30.583 --> 26:33.958
and see if he's truly invincible
as the legend says.

26:34.541 --> 26:35.791
If I get to meet him,

26:35.875 --> 26:38.833
I want to let him experience defeat.

26:40.666 --> 26:43.541
Have you heard of someone named Cao Cao?

26:45.041 --> 26:49.333
Who in the world of martial arts
hasn't heard of him?

26:51.000 --> 26:54.166
After Cao Cao chastised the ministers
at the Situ's banquet,

26:54.666 --> 26:57.916
Situ Wang Yun found out that he intends
to assassinate Dong Zhuo.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.958
So he secretly took Cao Cao
to a room in his residence.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.166
Didn't you want to kick me out?

27:04.750 --> 27:06.416
Why are you asking me to stay?

27:08.791 --> 27:11.125
I feigned anger
because there were too many eyes.

27:11.208 --> 27:14.458
I hope you forgive me.

27:20.625 --> 27:24.583
Mengde, do you have a way
to get rid of Dong Zhuo?

27:24.666 --> 27:27.916
Even if I don't have much power,

27:28.000 --> 27:31.166
I'm willing to assist you
in any way I can.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.333
There's no need.

27:33.250 --> 27:36.083
I'm planning to go
and assassinate Dong Zhuo by myself.

27:37.416 --> 27:39.500
As long as I can kill Dong Zhuo,

27:40.083 --> 27:41.875
I'm willing to die.

27:53.416 --> 27:56.750
I, Cao Mengde, am here
to meet with the chancellor.

27:58.583 --> 27:59.791
Greetings, General Lu.

28:02.833 --> 28:06.250
Son, this man's writing is very good.

28:07.083 --> 28:10.833
I like to read and listen to his reports.

28:11.833 --> 28:13.083
He's a good role model.

28:13.166 --> 28:14.791
Thank you for your compliment, Chancellor.

28:15.166 --> 28:17.583
I simply wrote my true thoughts.

28:17.666 --> 28:20.625
With you here,
the nation would surely be peaceful.

28:24.541 --> 28:28.125
I just received a bunch
of Akhal-Teke horses recently.

28:28.208 --> 28:32.166
Son, pick a good horse
and give it to Mengde.

28:32.750 --> 28:34.375
Thank you for your generosity, Chancellor.

28:35.166 --> 28:38.708
Come, let's have a drink today.

29:13.500 --> 29:14.375
Mengde.

29:14.458 --> 29:17.375
This Seven-Star Dagger cuts through steel
as if it were mud.

29:17.875 --> 29:19.708
I'm giving it to you now.

29:21.625 --> 29:23.625
I, Cao Mengde, swear to the heavens

29:24.666 --> 29:26.333
that even if I die,

29:26.416 --> 29:30.041
I will surely bring back Dong Zhuo's head
and hang it in front of Jinluan Court

29:30.125 --> 29:31.833
to appease the wrath of the people.

29:44.791 --> 29:45.708
What are you doing?

29:45.791 --> 29:48.125
This Seven-Star Dagger cuts through steel
as if it were mud.

29:48.208 --> 29:49.375
It's very rare.

29:49.458 --> 29:52.541
I want to give this dagger to you.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.791
Is there such a thing?

30:01.875 --> 30:03.375
It's very rare.

30:03.875 --> 30:06.750
If you don't believe me,
you can try it yourself.

30:14.458 --> 30:16.250
It's a good one indeed.

30:18.875 --> 30:20.125
Godfather.

30:20.208 --> 30:22.166
I've already prepared the horse.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.083
Thank you, Chancellor.

30:27.166 --> 30:30.291
I'll go ahead then.

30:30.875 --> 30:31.750
All right.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.416
It's a good dagger indeed.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.833
This dagger was supposed
to be used to kill you.

30:42.916 --> 30:45.875
Cao Cao wasn't here to give you that.
He was here to assassinate you.

30:48.458 --> 30:52.875
Cao Mengde was sincere and calm
when he gave me the dagger.

30:52.958 --> 30:55.875
I didn't see any sign of him
wanting to kill me.

30:56.541 --> 30:59.125
I even wanted to get him on my side
and gave him a horse.

30:59.208 --> 31:01.333
Why would he want to kill me?

31:01.416 --> 31:02.375
Trust me.

31:10.458 --> 31:12.875
Master Cao, I've already prepared
the horse for you.

31:13.750 --> 31:15.125
This is a really good horse.

31:15.208 --> 31:18.708
In my opinion, Cao Cao is very suspicious.

31:19.291 --> 31:23.458
Just let General Lu capture Cao Cao
and interrogate him.

31:23.541 --> 31:24.583
Don't worry.

31:25.208 --> 31:26.625
If it's true,

31:27.541 --> 31:29.250
he won't be able
to go out of Luoyang anyway.

31:35.875 --> 31:36.958
Pursue him.

32:03.208 --> 32:05.500
Don't let him out! Pursue him!

32:14.541 --> 32:15.583
Go!

33:00.541 --> 33:01.791
Go!

35:35.250 --> 35:36.375
Is that a person?

35:36.875 --> 35:38.125
I think so.

35:45.250 --> 35:46.500
Come on.

35:48.041 --> 35:50.416
Let's drink together.

35:55.458 --> 35:57.541
-Chancellor.
-And you--

35:58.125 --> 35:59.166
Chancellor?

36:00.083 --> 36:01.833
-Chancellor?
-Help me up!

36:05.500 --> 36:10.083
Chancellor, we've searched everywhere
but can't find Cao Cao's body.

36:11.916 --> 36:14.833
I won't believe he's dead
until his corpse is found.

36:15.750 --> 36:17.541
Either find him if he's alive

36:17.625 --> 36:18.833
or show me his corpse!

36:18.916 --> 36:20.958
After his failed attempt on Dong's life,

36:21.041 --> 36:24.000
wanted posters for Cao Cao
were everywhere.

36:24.083 --> 36:27.583
Because of that, he became infamous.

36:27.666 --> 36:29.666
-Don't get in the way.
-Come and let me see.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.458
-Go away.
-You, come here!

36:31.541 --> 36:32.833
What is this?

36:41.083 --> 36:42.125
REWARD

36:45.000 --> 36:46.375
REWARD

36:48.708 --> 36:51.000
-Move!
-Get out of the way!

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Cao Cao survived,

36:54.083 --> 36:58.166
but the villagers who saved him
betrayed him in the end.

36:58.666 --> 37:00.666
They reported him to the authorities
for the reward.

37:01.250 --> 37:04.416
He was captured
by County Governor Chen Gong in the end.

37:16.416 --> 37:19.583
I'm a businessman. My surname is Huangfu.

37:20.208 --> 37:21.250
You've got the wrong man.

37:21.333 --> 37:23.250
CHEN GONG

37:23.333 --> 37:24.833
Cao Mengde.

37:25.416 --> 37:26.791
How would I fail to recognize you?

37:27.625 --> 37:28.583
Back then,

37:29.333 --> 37:32.125
when I begged for help
in your residence in Luoyang,

37:32.208 --> 37:34.166
ZHONGMU COUNTY OFFICE

37:34.250 --> 37:36.666
I remembered how you insulted me.

37:37.791 --> 37:40.875
Tomorrow, I'll bring your head
to the capital and claim my reward.

37:42.333 --> 37:43.208
Lock him up!

38:01.458 --> 38:02.333
You may go.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.041
You're really not afraid to die?

38:07.125 --> 38:09.208
I heard the chancellor treated you nicely.

38:09.791 --> 38:11.791
Why did you seek your own doom?

38:14.333 --> 38:15.916
If I was afraid to die,

38:17.250 --> 38:19.208
I would have become
a minor official like you.

38:21.625 --> 38:22.916
But I couldn't do it.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.500
Everyone knows your name.

38:26.416 --> 38:29.750
You can now die as a hero
and become famous.

38:30.708 --> 38:32.125
Can you die in peace?

38:32.208 --> 38:33.416
No.

38:35.125 --> 38:37.000
I shouldn't have made
an assassination attempt.

38:37.750 --> 38:39.875
Since I vowed to save
the nation from disaster,

38:39.958 --> 38:41.666
I should have gathered troops and horses

38:41.750 --> 38:44.958
to defeat Dong Zhuo
and truly restore peace to the world.

38:46.208 --> 38:48.291
A heroic assassin?

38:52.791 --> 38:53.833
I don't want that.

38:54.333 --> 38:57.500
Do you know how much bounty
is on your head?

38:59.208 --> 39:01.458
I won't be able to spend
all that money in this lifetime.

39:07.750 --> 39:10.291
Then give my head
to Dong Zhuo for the money.

39:11.083 --> 39:13.166
Let your family
and your descendants spend it.

39:14.500 --> 39:18.208
How can a common fellow
read the mind of a great man?

39:21.708 --> 39:22.916
Kill me if you want.

39:23.625 --> 39:26.458
Cao Cao, who was planning to die a hero,

39:26.541 --> 39:29.541
moved Chen Gong before he was executed.

39:29.625 --> 39:31.416
You're a real hero, Mengde.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.833
A state scholar of no equal. I admire you.

39:34.583 --> 39:35.458
Please accept my bow.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.875
Chen Gong was willing to give up
his position and his family.

39:38.958 --> 39:40.833
And assist Cao Cao in his plans.

39:40.916 --> 39:41.750
THREE MONTHS LATER

39:41.833 --> 39:44.583
Later on, they went
to Lu Boshe's residence,

39:44.666 --> 39:48.625
the sworn brother of Cao Cao's father.

39:50.750 --> 39:54.041
LU BOSHE

39:55.333 --> 39:57.000
It's fine now.

39:57.083 --> 39:59.375
You're safe, so it's fine now.

39:59.458 --> 40:00.875
Thank you, Master Lu.

40:00.958 --> 40:02.250
We're family. Don't be shy.

40:02.875 --> 40:04.416
And this is--

40:05.291 --> 40:06.791
this is my friend

40:06.875 --> 40:09.041
Chen Gong, Chen Gongtai.

40:09.125 --> 40:10.375
He's my savior.

40:10.458 --> 40:13.166
I would have been executed if not for him.

40:14.458 --> 40:16.250
Greetings, Master Lu.

40:16.333 --> 40:19.000
Goodness, Gongtai,

40:19.083 --> 40:20.958
please accept my bow.

40:21.041 --> 40:22.250
You're welcome.

40:22.750 --> 40:24.625
Thank you for taking care of Cao Cao.

40:24.708 --> 40:26.125
Follow me.

40:26.208 --> 40:28.166
Come here, hurry.

40:28.250 --> 40:29.583
Come on.

40:30.208 --> 40:32.000
This is my family.

40:32.083 --> 40:34.500
These are my three sons and their wives.

40:34.583 --> 40:35.750
This is my wife.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.333
He's the son of my sworn brother.

40:39.416 --> 40:40.541
Cao Cao.

40:42.541 --> 40:46.541
He attempted
to assassinate Dong Zhuo all by himself.

40:46.625 --> 40:48.500
Now, he's famous.

40:48.583 --> 40:52.458
It's such an honor for him
to visit our humble home.

40:52.541 --> 40:53.791
Father.

40:56.041 --> 40:56.875
We have guests.

40:56.958 --> 40:59.250
-Bring out our best wine!
-The wine--

40:59.333 --> 41:00.208
It's all gone.

41:02.250 --> 41:03.291
Sirs.

41:03.375 --> 41:06.916
I'll ask my wife
to prepare the best dishes.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.833
I'll go out and buy
the best wine to entertain you.

41:09.916 --> 41:12.083
You must be tired from traveling
all the way here.

41:12.166 --> 41:14.125
Son, take them to the guest room.

41:14.208 --> 41:16.791
Just follow him. Get some rest.

41:20.250 --> 41:21.208
Go.

41:21.958 --> 41:23.541
Kill these two pigs.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.750
Cao Cao, what's the matter?

41:52.083 --> 41:53.625
I hear knife sharpening sounds.

41:56.166 --> 41:57.916
We're so unlucky. We have two jinxes.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.875
Shut up and get the ropes.

42:02.208 --> 42:04.500
We'll go in silently later.
Don't make a sound.

42:04.583 --> 42:06.958
It's best if we can finish them
in a single strike.

42:07.041 --> 42:08.291
Come here.

42:08.375 --> 42:10.166
Let's finish them in a single strike

42:10.250 --> 42:11.666
when they are asleep later.

42:13.916 --> 42:17.125
Lu Boshe isn't your relative.
Why would he risk his life to save us?

42:18.333 --> 42:20.625
Buying wine was a ruse
to alert the authorities,

42:20.708 --> 42:23.375
then he'll let his family kill us
while we're sleeping soundly.

42:23.458 --> 42:24.958
What should we do now?

42:27.250 --> 42:28.416
Let's charge outside.

42:29.291 --> 42:31.083
I won't die without a fight.

42:37.875 --> 42:41.000
Don't be so loud, don't scare them away.
Guard the door.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.125
What are you doing?

43:09.458 --> 43:10.333
Wait.

43:15.041 --> 43:15.916
Look.

43:17.875 --> 43:19.166
We killed good people.

43:21.250 --> 43:23.750
Tie up the pigs. I'll sharpen the knife.

43:24.250 --> 43:25.708
We'll go in silently later.

43:25.791 --> 43:26.750
Don't wake them up.

43:34.916 --> 43:35.750
Let's go.

43:43.750 --> 43:45.166
Stop.

43:47.625 --> 43:50.708
Why are you leaving so soon?
Why didn't you wait for me?

43:51.458 --> 43:52.333
Master Lu.

43:52.833 --> 43:55.041
We're sinners.
We shouldn't stay in your house for long.

43:55.125 --> 43:57.375
-We'd better get going.
-Hey.

43:57.458 --> 43:59.125
No, don't go.

43:59.208 --> 44:01.125
Look, I've already bought the wine.

44:01.208 --> 44:04.625
Let's have a drink. Leave tomorrow.
They've slaughtered the pigs.

44:04.708 --> 44:08.291
If I don't entertain you properly,
how can I face your father?

44:08.375 --> 44:09.458
Master Lu.

44:12.375 --> 44:14.333
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

44:16.875 --> 44:18.541
I've wronged you.

44:20.958 --> 44:22.916
I killed your family by mistake.

44:27.583 --> 44:28.541
What?

44:28.625 --> 44:31.250
What did you say?

44:35.083 --> 44:36.416
I'm sorry.

45:03.708 --> 45:06.875
Why did you kill him
even though it was a misunderstanding?

45:06.958 --> 45:08.166
If I didn't kill him,

45:09.541 --> 45:11.791
he would surely gather men
and seek me out in revenge.

45:13.500 --> 45:14.791
I have only one goal.

45:15.583 --> 45:17.541
Gather troops and defeat Dong Zhuo.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.583
I don't have any other choice.

45:26.291 --> 45:28.541
I'd rather wrong people

45:29.416 --> 45:31.916
than being wronged by them.

45:34.291 --> 45:37.583
For my entire life,
I have owed no one but Lu Boshe.

45:38.458 --> 45:41.041
If I don't save the nation
and the Han Dynasty,

45:41.583 --> 45:44.000
seek your vengeance from me
in the afterlife.

45:49.541 --> 45:50.500
Wait!

45:51.916 --> 45:53.750
You're just going
to leave his body in the wild?

45:54.583 --> 45:55.916
Let's bury him properly.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.708
Otherwise, people will revile you.

45:57.791 --> 45:59.458
The traditions of death exist

46:00.166 --> 46:02.291
just to make the living feel better.

46:02.916 --> 46:06.125
I'd rather be reviled by people
for thousands of years

46:06.208 --> 46:07.750
than bow to hypocrisy.

46:09.583 --> 46:11.875
Since we've already vowed
to save the nation,

46:13.291 --> 46:15.875
we can't postpone our cause
because of personal matters.

46:18.416 --> 46:20.250
Since I can't right my wrong,

46:21.083 --> 46:22.333
let me

46:23.416 --> 46:24.833
be wrong until the end.

47:09.166 --> 47:10.083
How pathetic.

47:11.333 --> 47:13.375
Kill me if you want to.
Why did you hesitate?

47:17.125 --> 47:19.333
In order to save the nation
in this chaotic period,

47:19.416 --> 47:22.333
we shouldn't rely on compassion,
but on actual skills,

47:22.416 --> 47:25.125
determination,
and the will to save the people.

47:25.750 --> 47:28.000
I know that I would never

47:28.083 --> 47:30.416
have another good friend in this lifetime,

47:30.500 --> 47:32.541
but I'm not afraid of being alone.

47:32.625 --> 47:35.625
I firmly believe that the heavens
would send me real comrades.

47:44.916 --> 47:48.541
From the first time I saw him,
I've already noticed how unique he is.

47:49.500 --> 47:53.083
The unrivaled power in him
is very special.

47:53.916 --> 47:58.041
It's a bottomless power
that can swallow up the world.

47:58.125 --> 48:03.250
And he has the courage and the wisdom
that surpasses ordinary people.

48:04.583 --> 48:06.708
The General Sword
is finally out of its sheath.

48:06.791 --> 48:09.041
It has waited for you for over 100 years.

48:09.125 --> 48:13.000
You've been chosen by the heavens
to save the nation.

48:13.083 --> 48:15.500
You're destined to rule.

48:16.166 --> 48:19.666
You're talking about the General Sword
that can save the world?

48:19.750 --> 48:20.708
That's right.

48:21.375 --> 48:23.416
He took the General Sword away

48:23.500 --> 48:26.583
and is now planning
to gather troops and horses.

48:26.666 --> 48:28.583
CHENLIU CITY

48:29.375 --> 48:30.250
Father.

48:30.750 --> 48:33.458
Can we sell all our land and houses?

48:34.500 --> 48:37.041
I want to gather troops and horses
and build my own army

48:37.125 --> 48:38.458
to defeat Dong Zhuo.

48:39.125 --> 48:42.833
Even if we sell all our assets,
I'm afraid it still won't be enough.

48:45.083 --> 48:46.041
It's enough.

48:46.791 --> 48:49.708
I'm going to kill Dong Zhuo
with my loyalty and courage.

48:49.791 --> 48:51.166
That's more than enough.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.291
I believe

48:54.458 --> 48:56.208
that the nation will respond to it.

48:57.291 --> 49:01.291
NOTICE

49:02.583 --> 49:04.500
"By His Majesty's secret decree,

49:04.583 --> 49:09.458
we're gathering men to rid Huaxia
of our enemies.

49:09.541 --> 49:11.875
To form a righteous army
to defeat our common enemy together,

49:11.958 --> 49:14.375
defend the imperial family,
and save the citizens.

49:14.458 --> 49:16.875
Heed this decree today
and take swift action.

49:16.958 --> 49:18.541
Cao Cao is loyal and courageous.

49:18.625 --> 49:21.416
He's planning
to assassinate Dong Zhuo alone."

49:21.500 --> 49:24.791
Are you willing to fight with him?

49:24.875 --> 49:28.125
-Yes!
-Yes!

49:28.208 --> 49:31.958
-Yes!
-Yes!

49:35.958 --> 49:37.208
LOYALTY

49:37.291 --> 49:40.750
Brothers, let's follow General Cao
even in death.

49:40.833 --> 49:44.250
-Yes!
-Yes!

49:44.333 --> 49:45.875
-Based on my rules,
-Yes!

49:46.416 --> 49:47.833
people who come here

49:47.916 --> 49:50.708
are destined to be legendary heroes.

49:51.375 --> 49:55.125
They can get a rare weapon from me.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.958
Like humans,
weapons have destinies and spirits.

50:00.041 --> 50:02.458
It will choose its rightful owner.

50:02.541 --> 50:04.708
Once it chooses its owner,

50:04.791 --> 50:08.125
it will grow and die with him.

50:25.958 --> 50:27.500
If that was a hallucination,

50:28.875 --> 50:30.250
it wouldn't be this realistic.

50:32.125 --> 50:34.375
This must be a sign from the heavens.

50:36.708 --> 50:37.916
I, Liu Bei…

50:39.416 --> 50:41.083
I, Guan Yu…

50:41.583 --> 50:42.916
I, Zhang Fei…

50:43.000 --> 50:44.458
Hereby vow

50:45.125 --> 50:46.625
to kill Dong Zhuo

50:47.583 --> 50:49.583
and restore the Han Dynasty.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.375
The three of us

50:52.750 --> 50:55.250
-vowed to live and die together.
-Vowed to live and die together.

51:09.708 --> 51:10.541
FORTRESS

51:17.000 --> 51:20.375
Please come in, Jizhou Governor Han Fu.

51:25.166 --> 51:27.166
Yuzhou Governor Kong Zhou.

51:31.458 --> 51:33.625
Yongzhou Governor Liu Dan.

Lord of Wucheng,
Changsha Governor Sun Jian.

52:11.875 --> 52:13.458
-Go!
-Go!

52:25.750 --> 52:27.333
Heroes Peak is up ahead.

52:27.416 --> 52:29.375
It overlooks Hulao Pass.

52:52.083 --> 52:54.916
FORTRESS

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Stop! Who are you?

53:01.583 --> 53:03.958
We're here to join the alliance.

53:04.041 --> 53:05.791
You're here to join the alliance?

53:06.458 --> 53:09.666
May I ask which lord's army
do you belong to?

53:11.125 --> 53:12.583
Or are you horse herders?

53:16.291 --> 53:18.541
Sir, please inform them

53:18.625 --> 53:23.375
that Liu Bei, Guan Yu,
and Zhang Fei from Pingyuan

53:23.458 --> 53:24.833
are here to join the alliance.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.416
This is our invitation.

53:30.333 --> 53:31.541
INVITATION

53:31.625 --> 53:33.208
You have an invitation too?

53:33.291 --> 53:35.958
You must have stolen this, right?

53:36.041 --> 53:37.125
-You--
-Zhang Fei.

53:38.083 --> 53:39.375
Calm down.

53:39.458 --> 53:42.541
Only heroes will come here.
Don't give them a hard time.

53:43.333 --> 53:44.625
CAO

53:49.958 --> 53:51.875
CAO

53:51.958 --> 53:53.791
Let them in if they have an invitation.

53:53.875 --> 53:55.375
Greetings, Master Cao.

53:55.458 --> 53:58.125
I'm Yuan Chen, Lord Yuan's advisor.

53:58.208 --> 54:00.166
My lord has long known

54:00.250 --> 54:03.041
how you went to assassinate Dong Zhuo
by yourself back then.

54:03.125 --> 54:05.708
He deeply admires you,
so he especially sent me here

54:05.791 --> 54:08.041
to welcome you into the city.

54:08.750 --> 54:11.000
-Thank you.
-He's Cao Cao?

54:11.083 --> 54:12.375
This way, General.

54:12.458 --> 54:13.583
CAO

54:41.875 --> 54:42.750
Yuan Shao

54:43.250 --> 54:46.375
comes from a long line
of high-ranking officials.

54:46.458 --> 54:48.416
Among all warlords,

54:48.500 --> 54:51.333
he has the largest army
and the most provisions.

54:52.208 --> 54:54.208
He has lots of valiant warriors under him.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.083
He must be the commander
of the alliance right now.

54:58.166 --> 54:59.208
YUAN SHAO

54:59.291 --> 55:01.916
True heroes don't rely on backgrounds

55:03.541 --> 55:05.250
and the number of their supporters.

55:05.333 --> 55:08.250
I, Wang Kuang, pay my respects to you.

55:08.333 --> 55:11.791
I brought 20,000 troops with me.

55:11.875 --> 55:13.666
I, Gongsun Zan, pay my respects to you.

55:13.750 --> 55:16.250
I brought 15,000 troops with me.

55:16.333 --> 55:19.291
Greetings, Lord Yuan, I'm Han Fu.

55:19.375 --> 55:21.625
I brought 25,000 troops with me.

55:25.250 --> 55:26.291
Lord Yuan.

55:27.166 --> 55:28.500
I'm Sun Jian.

55:28.583 --> 55:30.583
I brought 28,000 strong troops.

55:30.666 --> 55:33.208
Valiant warriors from Jiangdong
are strong and invincible.

55:33.291 --> 55:34.250
SUN JIAN

55:34.333 --> 55:37.000
Beside him should be his youngest son,

55:37.083 --> 55:37.916
Sun Quan.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.708
Jiangdong is renowned
for its naval battle commanders.

55:43.583 --> 55:46.000
But Hulao Pass is in the mountains.

55:46.583 --> 55:48.375
Once they leave Jiangdong…

55:50.708 --> 55:52.291
I, West Liang Governor Ma Teng,

55:52.375 --> 55:53.791
brought 18,000 troops.

55:53.875 --> 55:55.541
I, Cao Mengde,

55:56.083 --> 55:57.416
brought 20,000 troops.

56:07.583 --> 56:11.333
Since Lord Yuan has already been elected
as the alliance commander,

56:11.416 --> 56:14.125
let's listen to his command
and serve our nation together.

56:15.333 --> 56:17.291
Don't argue about
who's stronger and who's weaker.

56:17.375 --> 56:21.666
Mengde, your wanted posters
are everywhere.

56:22.375 --> 56:24.750
Everyone knows you.

56:26.041 --> 56:29.500
It's a shame that I failed
in my mission of killing Dong Zhuo.

56:30.125 --> 56:35.083
Dong Zhuo is aware of our plan
to oust him from Luoyang.

56:35.791 --> 56:40.750
He and Lu Bu have already led
150,000 troops to the east of Hulao Pass.

56:41.291 --> 56:46.250
They're already waiting for us
at Hulao Pass.

56:46.333 --> 56:48.125
We've gathered here today

56:48.208 --> 56:50.875
to have heaven, earth,
and our ancestors as our witnesses.

56:53.416 --> 56:56.833
Come, give the deer blood to the warlords!

57:00.416 --> 57:03.916
If we each provide half of our troops,

57:04.000 --> 57:06.875
we will have 180,000 ground troops

57:06.958 --> 57:08.291
and 100,000 cavalries.

57:08.958 --> 57:12.791
If we work together,
we'll surely be able to defeat Dong Zhuo.

57:12.875 --> 57:15.125
Come on, cheers!

57:15.208 --> 57:16.750
-Cheers!
-Wait!

57:18.125 --> 57:19.333
Count us in.

57:20.666 --> 57:22.833
We're also here to join the alliance.

57:24.041 --> 57:26.833
Who is bold enough to speak?

57:26.916 --> 57:29.416
I'm Liu Bei, Liu Xuande.

57:30.250 --> 57:31.958
This is my second brother, Guan Yunchang,

57:32.916 --> 57:34.333
and my third brother, Zhang Yide.

57:34.916 --> 57:36.208
Where are you from?

57:37.041 --> 57:38.375
What is your background?

57:38.458 --> 57:41.375
I'm the descendant of Liu Sheng,
Prince Jing from Zhongshan,

57:41.458 --> 57:44.458
who's the son of Emperor Jing
of the Han Dynasty.

57:44.541 --> 57:47.833
Since you're of royal lineage,
what is your current position?

57:47.916 --> 57:50.666
I don't have a position or title.

57:51.250 --> 57:52.750
I currently live in Pingyuan.

57:52.833 --> 57:54.458
What does your family do?

57:54.541 --> 57:56.750
We make straw shoes for a living.

57:59.958 --> 58:02.750
-Straw shoes?
-What about the two heroes next to you?

58:03.541 --> 58:05.541
Guan Yu is a guard.

58:06.375 --> 58:08.541
Zhang Fei slaughters pigs for a living.

58:11.375 --> 58:12.500
A pig slaughterer?

58:12.583 --> 58:15.458
Alliance Commander Yuan,
where exactly did you get these men

58:15.541 --> 58:18.250
to entertain your guests?

58:20.041 --> 58:21.291
How bold!

58:21.833 --> 58:23.750
My brother is a descendant
of the imperial family.

58:23.833 --> 58:25.750
How dare you mock him?

58:25.833 --> 58:27.458
How many troops did you bring?

58:28.166 --> 58:30.125
Just the three of us.

58:33.583 --> 58:34.916
You boast without shame.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.500
The 18 warlords here brought in

58:37.583 --> 58:39.666
at least 20,000 to 30,000 troops each.

58:40.291 --> 58:42.458
What can three people do?

58:45.416 --> 58:48.625
Killing traitors doesn't rely
on the number of warriors

58:48.708 --> 58:50.250
but on their loyalty and courage.

58:51.416 --> 58:52.958
We have loyalty and courage.

58:53.458 --> 58:55.333
So we dare to stand here.

58:57.750 --> 58:58.791
Well said!

58:59.541 --> 59:01.083
Very well said!

59:02.166 --> 59:05.083
These three men are loyal and courageous.

59:05.166 --> 59:07.750
They're the warriors
this chaotic time needs.

59:07.833 --> 59:10.583
They're dauntless and extraordinary.

59:13.500 --> 59:15.708
As a descendant
of Prince Jing from Zhongshan,

59:15.791 --> 59:18.000
I'll surely join the men
who want to defeat Dong Zhuo

59:18.833 --> 59:21.333
when the Han Dynasty is in danger.

59:22.291 --> 59:24.333
As long as I can serve the Han Dynasty,

59:25.500 --> 59:26.958
I'll do my best.

59:28.500 --> 59:30.583
I don't care what your name is.

59:30.666 --> 59:34.375
In defeating Dong Zhuo, one's background
and the number of his troops don't matter.

59:34.458 --> 59:36.958
We only care about guts and capabilities.

59:39.541 --> 59:40.625
Am I right, guys?

59:40.708 --> 59:41.958
-You have a point.
-You're right.

59:42.041 --> 59:42.958
Yes!

59:46.041 --> 59:48.166
-Tell me.
-What is it?

59:48.250 --> 59:49.791
The strategy to defeat Dong Zhuo.

59:49.875 --> 59:53.791
To defeat him, we must first save
His Majesty and help the Han Dynasty.

59:53.875 --> 59:57.625
Dong Zhuo's regime will collapse
without the young emperor as a hostage.

59:58.166 --> 59:59.333
But to save His Majesty,

59:59.416 --> 1:00:01.083
we need to get into Luoyang.

1:00:01.791 --> 1:00:03.458
So we must pass through Hulao Pass.

1:00:03.958 --> 1:00:06.000
You and I,
as well as Dong Zhuo, know that.

1:00:06.083 --> 1:00:09.458
That's why Dong Zhuo will use all
of his military power to guard Hulao Pass.

1:00:11.833 --> 1:00:13.416
He'll surely send Lu Bu there.

1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:16.083
What if we fail
to break through Hulao Pass?

1:00:16.708 --> 1:00:19.333
Then we have no chance
of defeating Dong Zhuo.

1:00:27.916 --> 1:00:29.458
Go through Hulao Pass

1:00:31.750 --> 1:00:33.166
-and kill Lu Bu.
-And kill Lu Bu.

1:00:33.750 --> 1:00:34.708
Exactly.

1:00:34.791 --> 1:00:37.083
Good! You three may join the alliance!

1:00:37.166 --> 1:00:38.666
Okay. Give them the blood.

1:00:42.666 --> 1:00:43.666
Here.

1:00:44.500 --> 1:00:47.708
I, Cao Mengde, toast to our alliance!

1:00:49.291 --> 1:00:50.416
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1:00:57.500 --> 1:00:58.458
We still lack something.

1:00:59.875 --> 1:01:01.125
What is it?

1:01:02.208 --> 1:01:03.125
An imperial decree.

1:01:04.125 --> 1:01:05.083
An imperial decree?

1:01:05.833 --> 1:01:08.291
This is His Majesty's secret blood decree

1:01:08.375 --> 1:01:10.666
that I got from
the imperial city of Luoyang.

1:01:10.750 --> 1:01:15.208
He wanted me to take it out of the palace
and gather warriors

1:01:15.291 --> 1:01:18.541
to save him, defeat Dong Zhuo,
and save the citizens.

1:01:18.625 --> 1:01:20.125
Eighteen warlords,

1:01:20.750 --> 1:01:21.708
receive your orders.

1:01:28.208 --> 1:01:29.583
"The traitor Dong Zhuo

1:01:30.250 --> 1:01:33.333
destroyed our nation, killed the emperor,
brought chaos to the regime,

1:01:33.416 --> 1:01:36.416
debauched the palace,
and killed innocent people.

1:01:37.083 --> 1:01:40.416
I call upon you using my blood

1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:43.583
to lead troops to save me,
defeat Dong Zhuo,

1:01:43.666 --> 1:01:46.333
help the imperial family,
and save the citizens.

1:01:46.958 --> 1:01:50.333
Heed this decree today
and take swift action."

1:01:51.708 --> 1:01:52.958
Wait.

1:01:54.625 --> 1:01:56.166
Did you really meet His Majesty?

1:01:56.250 --> 1:01:59.666
Was that imperial decree
really written by His Majesty?

1:02:04.583 --> 1:02:05.833
Of course it's fake.

1:02:06.666 --> 1:02:08.583
-Fake?
-I wrote it.

1:02:09.166 --> 1:02:10.958
-How bold of you to fake it!
-You!

1:02:11.458 --> 1:02:12.458
Alliance Commander Yuan!

1:02:14.708 --> 1:02:15.916
You wrote it?

1:02:17.541 --> 1:02:19.208
We need legitimacy for our cause.

1:02:21.166 --> 1:02:23.416
We need it, so it's real.

1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:27.541
Dong Zhuo treats
the young emperor like a toy.

1:02:29.625 --> 1:02:32.625
If we succeed in bringing him down,

1:02:32.708 --> 1:02:35.666
no one will doubt
the authenticity of this decree.

1:02:36.541 --> 1:02:38.375
If we fail,

1:02:38.958 --> 1:02:40.791
what's the use of this decree

1:02:42.583 --> 1:02:44.291
even if it's real?

1:02:46.125 --> 1:02:48.000
We must be careful of this man.

1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:49.750
Since it's a fake decree,

1:02:50.541 --> 1:02:53.958
shouldn't we have an agreement first?

1:02:54.791 --> 1:02:57.708
We've all gathered here today.

1:02:58.333 --> 1:03:02.125
Whoever gets into Luoyang
and saves His Majesty first

1:03:03.583 --> 1:03:05.833
should be the Grand Chief Controller.

1:03:05.916 --> 1:03:06.958
All right.

1:03:07.041 --> 1:03:10.958
Alliance Commander Yuan,
I'll lead the attack first

1:03:11.041 --> 1:03:13.333
-and go to Hulao Pass.
-All right.

1:03:13.416 --> 1:03:16.375
My army will provide support
and provisions.

1:03:16.958 --> 1:03:19.458
-All right, take care.
-Please go ahead.

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.625
-I want one too.
-Hurry up and feed the grapes.

1:03:35.125 --> 1:03:36.125
Delicious.

1:03:37.541 --> 1:03:38.583
Chancellor.

1:03:38.666 --> 1:03:40.416
We've received a report from our scout.

1:03:40.500 --> 1:03:43.791
Jiangdong's Sun Jian has broken through
three of our defensive lines

1:03:43.875 --> 1:03:45.583
at Hulao Pass.

1:03:48.208 --> 1:03:50.000
They plan to attack Luoyang.

1:03:50.083 --> 1:03:52.916
What should we do?

1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:54.291
I'll go.

1:03:54.375 --> 1:03:56.833
Why should we use a butcher's knife
to slaughter a chicken?

1:03:56.916 --> 1:03:58.250
I, Hua Xiong, will go.

1:03:59.208 --> 1:04:00.708
I'll let them see for themselves

1:04:01.458 --> 1:04:05.166
the invincible top warrior of West Liang,

1:04:05.250 --> 1:04:06.583
Hua Xiong!

1:04:15.958 --> 1:04:19.000
YUAN

1:04:23.125 --> 1:04:24.416
After isolating the black pieces,

1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:26.333
you even gave yourself an escape route.

1:04:26.416 --> 1:04:28.916
Actually, you've already defeated
the black pieces

1:04:29.583 --> 1:04:31.000
and cornered them.

1:04:31.583 --> 1:04:32.958
You're incredible indeed.

1:04:33.583 --> 1:04:35.375
Based on your chess skills,

1:04:35.458 --> 1:04:37.875
you must be good at military tactics.

1:04:37.958 --> 1:04:39.375
Since I can't join the battle,

1:04:39.916 --> 1:04:41.541
I can only play chess to kill time.

1:04:42.375 --> 1:04:44.166
You stepped up
to protect your brother earlier.

1:04:45.166 --> 1:04:46.041
I admire you.

1:04:46.125 --> 1:04:47.958
Since we arrived here,

1:04:48.791 --> 1:04:50.541
Liu Bei bore with the insults,

1:04:51.208 --> 1:04:53.833
waiting for a chance
to defeat the traitor and gain merits.

1:04:55.333 --> 1:04:57.958
Liu Bei must be an extraordinary man

1:04:58.041 --> 1:05:00.875
to be able to become your sworn brother.

1:05:03.833 --> 1:05:07.250
I admire your heroism in attempting
to assassinate Dong Zhuo.

1:05:08.250 --> 1:05:09.375
However,

1:05:10.208 --> 1:05:12.458
I only follow Liu Bei.

1:05:18.041 --> 1:05:20.916
I admire your loyalty more.

1:05:23.041 --> 1:05:26.291
Bad news. Sun Jian's troops lost
to Hua Xiong's West Liang army.

1:05:26.375 --> 1:05:28.375
Hua Xiong is currently clamoring
outside the city.

1:05:28.458 --> 1:05:29.708
He even said

1:05:30.458 --> 1:05:32.083
that he wants your head, General.

1:05:32.583 --> 1:05:34.166
He came alone to challenge us

1:05:34.833 --> 1:05:37.166
just because he wants to demoralize us.

1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.750
However, it can also be a chance
to prove ourselves.

1:05:45.750 --> 1:05:47.583
Things are finally getting interesting.

1:05:59.916 --> 1:06:04.000
You rebels have gathered here
for a long time.

1:06:04.083 --> 1:06:08.125
I came under Chancellor Dong's command
to defeat you.

1:06:08.958 --> 1:06:12.125
Dong Zhuo has so many valiant warriors.
They're all good at fighting.

1:06:12.958 --> 1:06:15.166
Hua Xiong is West Liang's top warrior.

1:06:15.958 --> 1:06:18.333
He's Dong Zhuo's third valiant warrior.

1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:22.750
He's just third in the ranks,
far from Lu Bu.

1:06:22.833 --> 1:06:24.583
If we can't defeat Hua Xiong,

1:06:25.541 --> 1:06:26.916
what more Lu Bu?

1:06:27.666 --> 1:06:29.000
We can't lose our first battle.

1:06:29.750 --> 1:06:34.083
Who dares to fight Hua Xiong
to bring glory to the alliance?

1:06:34.791 --> 1:06:36.333
Alliance Commander Yuan, I, Yu She,

1:06:36.416 --> 1:06:38.500
am willing to have
a one-on-one fight with him.

1:06:38.583 --> 1:06:41.583
General Yu She, you've gained
lots of merits and never lost a battle.

1:06:41.666 --> 1:06:42.791
Give me some wine!

1:06:43.708 --> 1:06:45.833
Let's all toast to him
to boost his morale!

1:06:45.916 --> 1:06:47.166
Thank you, sir.

1:07:15.916 --> 1:07:18.458
I don't think the situation's good.
The odds are against him.

1:07:27.208 --> 1:07:29.291
-Great!
-Great!

1:07:31.083 --> 1:07:34.541
Generals, who else is up
for the challenge?

1:07:41.666 --> 1:07:42.875
I'm Pan Feng.

1:07:42.958 --> 1:07:44.166
I am up for the challenge.

1:07:44.750 --> 1:07:46.416
-I swear to kill Hua Xiong!
-All right.

1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:48.791
If you can kill Hua Xiong,

1:07:49.375 --> 1:07:52.166
I'll reward you with 100 taels of gold
and 30 good horses.

1:07:52.250 --> 1:07:53.125
Get the wine!

1:08:19.458 --> 1:08:21.666
-Great!
-Great!

1:08:21.750 --> 1:08:23.958
Which general dares to fight next?

1:08:24.666 --> 1:08:26.333
I'll double the reward!

1:08:56.833 --> 1:08:57.958
This is ridiculous.

1:09:00.458 --> 1:09:02.750
Who else dares to meet his death?

1:09:03.750 --> 1:09:05.333
If you can't send anyone else,

1:09:05.958 --> 1:09:08.833
get out of the city and kneel
to surrender and beg for mercy!

1:09:09.625 --> 1:09:11.000
Then I'll spare you from death!

1:09:14.333 --> 1:09:16.208
I shall send my brother, Guan Yu,

1:09:16.291 --> 1:09:17.875
to fight Hua Xiong.

1:09:17.958 --> 1:09:19.250
What a joke!

1:09:19.958 --> 1:09:22.916
He killed my mighty general, Pan Feng.

1:09:23.791 --> 1:09:25.625
What right does a guard have

1:09:25.708 --> 1:09:28.500
to represent the alliance to fight him?

1:09:29.750 --> 1:09:31.666
We have only a few skilled fighters left.

1:09:31.750 --> 1:09:33.583
Don't mind one's background anymore.

1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.166
Go if you dare, Guan Yu.

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:47.333
I toast to you to bid you farewell.

1:09:54.166 --> 1:09:55.125
There's no need.

1:09:55.208 --> 1:09:57.291
Why would I need a toast
to boost my morale

1:09:57.833 --> 1:10:00.000
just to kill Hua Xiong?

1:10:00.791 --> 1:10:02.625
Let's drink when I come back.

1:10:22.708 --> 1:10:26.291
Guan Yu from the Liu Army
is here to fight you.

1:10:27.166 --> 1:10:29.125
Another nobody.

1:10:30.791 --> 1:10:32.166
Dismount and surrender!

1:10:36.583 --> 1:10:39.291
I'm more than enough to defeat you.

1:10:43.875 --> 1:10:46.291
Who should we send next?

1:10:46.375 --> 1:10:47.833
Who else would dare to fight?

1:10:47.916 --> 1:10:50.500
That guy just now was obviously
just playing the hero.

1:10:51.875 --> 1:10:54.666
What if another head flies in?

1:10:56.333 --> 1:10:59.625
Guan Yu will surely come back!

1:11:21.833 --> 1:11:22.875
You're a nobody.

1:11:23.625 --> 1:11:26.291
I didn't expect you to be good.

1:11:27.625 --> 1:11:29.958
It's a shame
that you're about to be decapitated.

1:11:30.958 --> 1:11:32.750
In the face of a weaker opponent,

1:11:33.333 --> 1:11:35.541
I usually let him win three rounds first.

1:11:36.208 --> 1:11:38.791
Now, the three rounds are over!

1:12:03.083 --> 1:12:04.458
Who will fight me?

1:12:08.291 --> 1:12:09.166
Let's go!

1:12:09.250 --> 1:12:14.625
-Go!
-Go!

1:12:14.708 --> 1:12:19.250
-Go!
-Go!

1:13:02.583 --> 1:13:03.708
That was fast!

1:13:08.041 --> 1:13:09.041
Here.

1:13:09.125 --> 1:13:12.041
Bring the head back to Dong Zhuo.

1:13:13.166 --> 1:13:15.500
It's a shame that I wasn't able
to witness the fight myself.

1:13:18.291 --> 1:13:19.500
The wine is still warm.

1:13:20.583 --> 1:13:21.666
Please enjoy.

1:13:29.666 --> 1:13:32.833
Come, give General Guan a seat.

1:13:32.916 --> 1:13:35.916
-Serve him the best food and wine.
-There's no need.

1:13:36.708 --> 1:13:40.333
I fought under the command of Liu Bei.

1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.875
If you want to give a reward,
give it to him.

1:13:46.750 --> 1:13:47.708
Alliance Commander Yuan.

1:13:48.833 --> 1:13:52.125
Since Guan Yu killed Dong Zhuo's man,
he deserves a reward.

1:13:52.625 --> 1:13:56.291
Please reward Liu Bei and Zhang Fei
together with him.

1:13:56.375 --> 1:13:58.750
Of course his feat deserves a reward.

1:13:59.583 --> 1:14:00.708
Attention, Liu Bei.

1:14:01.916 --> 1:14:04.791
The alliance has officially added
its 19th troop.

1:14:05.291 --> 1:14:07.625
The troop leader is Liu Bei.

1:14:07.708 --> 1:14:10.541
I accept your command.

1:14:51.291 --> 1:14:54.750
Inform the chancellor.
Sun Jian has ambushed Hulao Pass.

1:14:55.416 --> 1:14:56.458
How despicable!

1:14:57.125 --> 1:14:59.083
They killed my warrior, Hua Xiong.

1:14:59.833 --> 1:15:02.958
And 30,000
of my elite troops were defeated.

1:15:03.500 --> 1:15:07.375
Killing Hua Xiong boosted their morale.

1:15:07.458 --> 1:15:10.583
Sun Jian is already surrounding the city.

1:15:11.208 --> 1:15:15.083
The 18 treacherous warlords
gathered 500,000 men

1:15:15.166 --> 1:15:19.041
and even sent Hua Xiong's head back.

1:15:19.125 --> 1:15:20.750
How despicable!

1:15:21.250 --> 1:15:22.416
Who killed him?

1:15:25.958 --> 1:15:27.916
A nobody.

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:29.250
His name is

1:15:30.250 --> 1:15:31.541
Guan Yu.

1:15:39.583 --> 1:15:41.375
Attention, all generals!

1:15:41.458 --> 1:15:44.833
I've decided to send 500,000 troops
and split them into two.

1:15:44.916 --> 1:15:48.875
Li Jue and Guo Si will bring 50,000 troops

1:15:48.958 --> 1:15:51.625
to strengthen the defense
on both sides of Hulao Pass

1:15:51.708 --> 1:15:53.375
in order to prevent an ambush.

1:15:53.458 --> 1:15:55.333
Kill anyone who comes.

1:15:56.875 --> 1:15:59.583
I'll bring 150,000 troops with Li Ru,

1:15:59.666 --> 1:16:03.875
Fan Chou, and Zhang Ji
to guard the front of Hulao Pass.

1:16:03.958 --> 1:16:07.708
We're only 500 miles away
from the imperial city of Luoyang.

1:16:07.791 --> 1:16:09.833
We must guard this place well.

1:16:23.083 --> 1:16:24.000
Lu Bu.

1:16:24.083 --> 1:16:28.166
Lead 30,000 troops
and station in front of Hulao Pass.

1:16:28.250 --> 1:16:31.458
Be ready to engage the enemy!

1:16:53.333 --> 1:16:54.666
It's an invitation to war.

1:16:57.500 --> 1:16:58.541
It's from Lu Bu.

1:17:10.166 --> 1:17:11.291
Lu Bu?

1:17:24.583 --> 1:17:30.333
LU

1:17:30.416 --> 1:17:34.291
LU

1:17:42.125 --> 1:17:46.083
LU

1:17:46.166 --> 1:17:48.125
-A toast to the General!
-A toast to the General!

1:17:56.875 --> 1:17:58.500
Those 18 traitorous dogs…

1:18:00.500 --> 1:18:04.458
Only eight warlords are left
in the alliance.

1:18:04.541 --> 1:18:05.541
They all ran away?

1:18:06.041 --> 1:18:07.125
Yes.

1:18:08.083 --> 1:18:12.291
We only have less than
200,000 troops then?

1:18:12.916 --> 1:18:13.791
That's right.

1:18:16.083 --> 1:18:20.416
Most of the men who joined us
had unclear intentions.

1:18:20.500 --> 1:18:24.708
They just wanted to check the situation
and see if they could benefit from it.

1:18:24.791 --> 1:18:26.500
They pretended to want
to defeat Dong Zhuo,

1:18:26.583 --> 1:18:29.416
but they had other ambitions
and ulterior motives.

1:18:30.541 --> 1:18:33.833
Actually, they were just trying
to take advantage of the situation.

1:18:33.916 --> 1:18:35.833
Who doesn't know
that Lu Bu is the best among men,

1:18:35.916 --> 1:18:38.125
just like Red Hare
is the best among horses?

1:18:38.666 --> 1:18:41.166
I heard that he alone
can kill thousands of men and horses.

1:18:41.250 --> 1:18:46.291
And Dong Zhuo, who brought troops
from the west, is extremely fierce.

1:18:46.375 --> 1:18:48.625
No one wants to lose their troops.

1:18:50.333 --> 1:18:52.416
Who wouldn't lose their troops
if they offended Lu Bu?

1:18:53.041 --> 1:18:54.833
But if we don't defeat Lu Bu,

1:18:54.916 --> 1:18:56.708
how can we defeat Dong Zhuo?

1:18:58.583 --> 1:19:00.791
Don't come if you're afraid.

1:19:02.166 --> 1:19:03.583
Did we gather here

1:19:04.458 --> 1:19:07.083
just to kill a mere Hua Xiong?

1:19:08.708 --> 1:19:11.416
And you call yourselves generals.

1:19:13.958 --> 1:19:15.708
Luoyang has been

1:19:15.791 --> 1:19:18.375
the Han capital for over 200 years.

1:19:18.458 --> 1:19:20.083
It's on the verge of decline.

1:19:20.166 --> 1:19:23.208
For the sake of His Majesty's longevity,

1:19:23.291 --> 1:19:26.916
I have decided
to move the capital to Chang'an.

1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:28.875
What? Move the capital?

1:19:28.958 --> 1:19:30.333
Why?

1:19:30.416 --> 1:19:31.375
Go!

1:20:38.291 --> 1:20:39.208
Miss.

1:20:45.791 --> 1:20:46.791
Who are you?

1:20:47.666 --> 1:20:48.541
Don't come near me!

1:21:09.625 --> 1:21:11.333
Why are you committing suicide?

1:21:16.625 --> 1:21:18.541
Someone asked for my hand in marriage.

1:21:20.375 --> 1:21:21.791
My godfather accepted the proposal,

1:21:23.875 --> 1:21:25.500
but I don't want to marry him.

1:21:27.291 --> 1:21:28.708
I hate him.

1:21:29.791 --> 1:21:31.750
Since I have no other choice,

1:21:33.875 --> 1:21:35.500
I'd rather commit suicide.

1:21:43.416 --> 1:21:46.000
LU

1:21:46.083 --> 1:21:47.458
You are--

1:21:47.958 --> 1:21:49.875
From now on,
no one would dare to harm you.

1:21:51.208 --> 1:21:52.875
Tell the one who proposed to you

1:21:52.958 --> 1:21:54.625
that you're my woman.

1:21:56.583 --> 1:22:00.083
I'll surely come back to marry you
after I win the battle.

1:22:02.458 --> 1:22:03.750
General Lu.

1:22:05.875 --> 1:22:07.291
Why are you playing a joke on me?

1:22:07.375 --> 1:22:08.708
I never joke around.

1:22:13.250 --> 1:22:14.500
We just met.

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:17.416
How can I think that you're sincere?

1:22:23.416 --> 1:22:24.625
I believe you.

1:22:27.208 --> 1:22:28.458
I believe you.

1:22:33.750 --> 1:22:35.083
What is your name?

1:22:40.875 --> 1:22:42.125
Diao Chan.

1:22:45.083 --> 1:22:46.083
From now on,

1:22:47.333 --> 1:22:49.291
I'll stay devoted to you,
no matter what happens.

1:22:54.750 --> 1:22:56.333
My life…

1:22:58.500 --> 1:23:00.083
is now yours.

1:23:47.291 --> 1:23:49.625
I've never had the chance
to have a duel with you.

1:23:49.708 --> 1:23:51.666
Today is a rare opportunity to do so.

1:23:52.583 --> 1:23:54.166
It doesn't come easily.

1:23:55.125 --> 1:23:56.875
Maybe we'll have more time in the future.

1:24:13.708 --> 1:24:15.875
I think Yuan Shao also wants to run away.

1:24:16.291 --> 1:24:18.208
He just couldn't
because it would be embarrassing.

1:24:18.291 --> 1:24:21.250
He's the alliance commander after all,
with a prestigious lineage.

1:24:21.333 --> 1:24:22.625
That's one of the reasons.

1:24:22.708 --> 1:24:25.291
Most importantly,
if he doesn't defeat Dong Zhuo,

1:24:25.375 --> 1:24:27.708
Dong Zhuo will surely seek him out
for revenge.

1:24:27.791 --> 1:24:28.875
He's caught in a dilemma.

1:24:30.541 --> 1:24:32.916
What is your reason for staying then?

1:24:33.875 --> 1:24:35.458
The same as yours.

1:24:36.416 --> 1:24:37.875
How do you know what I'm thinking?

1:24:37.958 --> 1:24:40.458
I know that you really want
to save the Han Dynasty.

1:24:51.375 --> 1:24:53.708
-Don't you fear death?
-No.

1:24:53.791 --> 1:24:55.625
-I have only one fear.
-What?

1:24:55.708 --> 1:24:58.666
To die knowing
that the Han Dynasty is still in danger.

1:25:10.416 --> 1:25:12.875
The Han Dynasty is utterly corrupted.
What else can be saved?

1:25:13.375 --> 1:25:14.958
You've seen those warlords yourself.

1:25:15.041 --> 1:25:16.541
So what?

1:25:16.625 --> 1:25:19.875
They didn't join the alliance
because they believed in justice.

1:25:20.416 --> 1:25:22.166
Their desires are just like Dong Zhuo's.

1:25:22.250 --> 1:25:24.708
What do you three hope to gain?

1:25:24.791 --> 1:25:25.875
We don't want anything!

1:25:25.958 --> 1:25:28.333
As men of the Han Dynasty,
we have the duty to serve.

1:25:28.416 --> 1:25:32.041
Secondly, I don't want to see
the citizens suffer because of Dong Zhuo.

1:25:32.125 --> 1:25:34.166
For the sake
of the Han Dynasty and the citizens,

1:25:34.250 --> 1:25:36.041
I must fight until the end!

1:25:51.416 --> 1:25:52.750
Do you fear death?

1:25:53.375 --> 1:25:55.875
No. Do you believe me?

1:25:56.875 --> 1:25:57.916
I do.

1:26:17.416 --> 1:26:18.750
It's been a pleasure, Liu Bei.

1:26:18.833 --> 1:26:19.958
It's been a pleasure.

1:26:20.625 --> 1:26:23.875
I think you already know the next step.

1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:42.041
We have a plan.

1:26:42.125 --> 1:26:44.875
My brothers and I will fight Lu Bu.

1:26:44.958 --> 1:26:47.375
The eight troops and I
will split into five groups

1:26:47.458 --> 1:26:49.500
to attack Luoyang and kill Dong Zhuo.

1:26:49.583 --> 1:26:52.166
Lu Bu's martial arts skills
are unparalleled. Be careful.

1:26:52.250 --> 1:26:54.833
If you come back alive, then you've won.

1:26:55.625 --> 1:26:57.750
And you'll be famous.

1:27:11.666 --> 1:27:15.416
Without rebellions,
how can there be heroes?

1:27:22.250 --> 1:27:23.583
Brothers.

1:27:24.291 --> 1:27:26.375
We have 20,000 troops.

1:27:27.083 --> 1:27:30.791
Outside the city,
we'll face Lu Bu's 30,000 cavalries.

1:27:31.416 --> 1:27:33.500
This is a fight to the death.

1:27:34.083 --> 1:27:36.250
You once served the eight warlords.

1:27:36.333 --> 1:27:39.750
Now, you're sent here to follow our lead
and guard this place.

1:27:39.833 --> 1:27:42.125
You must think
you're here to be buried with us.

1:27:42.208 --> 1:27:43.041
LIU

1:27:43.125 --> 1:27:44.666
However, I don't agree with it.

1:27:44.750 --> 1:27:48.291
If you're not willing
to fight with us against Lu Bu,

1:27:48.375 --> 1:27:50.583
you can leave now.

1:27:50.666 --> 1:27:51.750
LIU

1:27:51.833 --> 1:27:52.875
Guan Yu.

1:27:57.833 --> 1:27:59.125
We will lose

1:27:59.916 --> 1:28:03.083
if we are not united in spirit.

1:28:03.666 --> 1:28:06.541
I just want warriors
who are not afraid to die.

1:28:06.625 --> 1:28:08.291
To those who are willing to stay,

1:28:08.875 --> 1:28:10.500
if I don't die,

1:28:11.208 --> 1:28:12.458
I'll surely stay with you

1:28:13.875 --> 1:28:15.333
through thick and thin.

1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:18.625
I'm willing to follow the three of you!

1:28:19.291 --> 1:28:20.500
-I'm willing!
-I'm willing!

1:28:20.583 --> 1:28:23.916
-I'm willing to follow the three of you!
-I'm willing!

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.375
-I'm willing!
-I'm willing to follow the three of you!

1:28:26.458 --> 1:28:28.708
-I'm willing!
-At a time like this, I didn't expect…

1:28:28.791 --> 1:28:29.791
-I'm willing!
-I'm willing!

1:28:29.875 --> 1:28:33.541
-We finally have our own troops.
-I'm willing!

1:28:45.666 --> 1:28:48.500
CAO

1:28:48.583 --> 1:28:50.583
To Luoyang!

1:28:50.666 --> 1:28:52.833
-Go!
-Go!

1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:00.083
"By His Majesty's secret decree,
we've gathered troops

1:29:00.166 --> 1:29:05.208
to the five main points,
east, south, west, north, and center.

1:29:05.291 --> 1:29:09.708
We'll assist each other to break
into Hulao Pass and save His Majesty."

1:29:17.791 --> 1:29:19.416
HULAO PASS

1:29:23.833 --> 1:29:28.791
LIU

1:29:43.875 --> 1:29:46.208
HULAO PASS

1:32:09.625 --> 1:32:10.791
What a bunch of losers.

1:32:14.666 --> 1:32:15.791
Retreat!

1:32:24.333 --> 1:32:25.458
-Go!
-Go!

1:32:43.500 --> 1:32:44.833
Change formation!

1:36:27.583 --> 1:36:30.666
You killed Hua Xiong
before your wine cooled.

1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:35.750
I'll do the same to you.

1:40:47.916 --> 1:40:49.958
Weapons have destinies and spirits.

1:40:50.666 --> 1:40:52.875
It will choose its rightful owner.

1:40:53.500 --> 1:40:55.166
The more opponents they kill,

1:40:55.250 --> 1:40:56.833
the stronger the weapons become.

1:40:56.916 --> 1:40:59.625
Do you remember that our weapons
are made from blood-drinking rocks?

1:41:00.250 --> 1:41:03.208
They will become more powerful
as they drink more blood.

1:41:04.458 --> 1:41:06.333
What if it's the owner's blood?

1:41:15.250 --> 1:41:16.291
Liu Bei.

1:41:17.041 --> 1:41:19.000
I was originally a fugitive.

1:41:20.916 --> 1:41:23.541
You gave me a second chance in life.

1:41:26.166 --> 1:41:27.333
Today,

1:41:28.375 --> 1:41:30.541
I have nothing to repay you with.

1:41:35.833 --> 1:41:37.458
Let's vow to live and die together.

1:41:44.416 --> 1:41:45.833
Let's vow to live

1:41:47.083 --> 1:41:48.625
and die together.

1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:56.500
Let's vow to live and die together.

1:42:53.833 --> 1:42:54.750
Chancellor,

1:42:54.833 --> 1:42:57.666
Situ Wang Yun's goddaughter
is waiting for you in the room.

1:42:58.291 --> 1:42:59.750
At a time like this,

1:42:59.833 --> 1:43:01.583
will you still marry her or not?

1:43:01.666 --> 1:43:02.666
I'll marry her!

1:43:05.208 --> 1:43:07.041
I waited for that beautiful woman
for so long.

1:43:07.583 --> 1:43:09.250
Why wouldn't I marry her?

1:43:14.708 --> 1:43:18.958
The rebels Cao Cao and Sun Jian
have already broken through Hulao Pass.

1:43:19.041 --> 1:43:20.958
We need to leave Luoyang quickly.

1:43:21.041 --> 1:43:24.375
We can't leave any provision
or treasure behind.

1:43:24.458 --> 1:43:27.166
In three days, I want Luoyang
to become a ghost city.

1:43:29.166 --> 1:43:33.333
General, our provisions will run out
in three days if we continue at this pace.

1:43:33.416 --> 1:43:35.458
We must get into Luoyang
and save His Majesty.

1:43:36.666 --> 1:43:38.375
We've come this far.

1:43:38.875 --> 1:43:41.541
We can already see Luoyang.
We can't die here.

1:43:41.625 --> 1:43:42.958
Charge!

1:43:45.500 --> 1:43:48.083
Summon General Lu with the smoke signal.

1:43:48.166 --> 1:43:49.083
Yes, sir!

1:44:09.333 --> 1:44:10.500
General Lu.

1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:49.541
Don't die yet, all of you.

1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:16.000
DONG

1:46:21.750 --> 1:46:22.833
General.

1:46:23.666 --> 1:46:25.958
Dong Zhuo has left Luoyang for Chang'an,

1:46:26.041 --> 1:46:27.833
taking the emperor with him.

1:46:27.916 --> 1:46:30.125
Sun Jian didn't wait
for Alliance Commander Yuan's orders

1:46:30.208 --> 1:46:33.083
and went into Luoyang
to get the imperial seal.

1:46:33.166 --> 1:46:34.750
Should we pursue him?

1:46:39.916 --> 1:46:42.541
The imperial seal is just
a symbolic object.

1:46:43.500 --> 1:46:47.166
It's more important
to get His Majesty back.

1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:53.166
DONG

1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:07.833
Diao Chan.

1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:11.000
Don't think too much.

1:47:11.708 --> 1:47:14.041
Dong Zhuo likes you so much.

1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:16.708
Grab the opportunity

1:47:17.625 --> 1:47:19.208
to kill him.

1:47:19.291 --> 1:47:20.416
All right.

1:47:21.375 --> 1:47:22.500
I'll remember that.

1:47:29.791 --> 1:47:33.750
My lord, only Sun Jian and our troops
really fought till the end,

1:47:33.833 --> 1:47:37.791
yet you're letting Sun Jian enter Luoyang.

1:47:37.875 --> 1:47:40.791
The one who enters first
will become the Grand Chief Controller.

1:47:41.541 --> 1:47:44.208
You're giving up the chance
of being the Grand Chief Controller.

1:47:44.291 --> 1:47:46.041
Aren't you getting
the short end of the stick?

1:47:47.583 --> 1:47:49.166
No one seems to understand

1:47:49.833 --> 1:47:52.333
that the emperor is
what gives the palace life.

1:47:52.416 --> 1:47:56.416
Wherever the emperor is, that's where
the Han Dynasty and the nation are.

1:47:56.500 --> 1:47:59.125
Of course, I should pursue Dong Zhuo
and save His Majesty.

1:48:00.875 --> 1:48:04.333
The Han Dynasty is in this situation
because its people are not united.

1:48:04.416 --> 1:48:08.666
Instead of having an alliance,
I should just make my own path.

1:48:08.750 --> 1:48:10.125
Go!

1:48:10.791 --> 1:48:14.083
-Go!
-Go!

1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:21.416
A FEW YEARS LATER

1:49:00.708 --> 1:49:04.916
LIU

1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:08.750
LIU

1:49:30.750 --> 1:49:33.875
I never expected you
to have your own little army too.

1:49:40.416 --> 1:49:42.625
It can't compare to your army of 100,000.

1:49:45.416 --> 1:49:48.750
I only had 5,000 troops back then.

1:49:49.791 --> 1:49:53.083
General Cao, why are you here?

1:49:53.666 --> 1:49:56.458
I want to drink and reminisce with you.

1:50:13.125 --> 1:50:15.166
Dong Zhuo escaped from Luoyang.

1:50:15.250 --> 1:50:17.833
The nation considers
the 18 warlords to be heroes.

1:50:19.166 --> 1:50:22.083
In my opinion, they are all useless.

1:50:25.583 --> 1:50:26.625
What kind of person

1:50:27.375 --> 1:50:30.208
do you think deserves to be called a hero?

1:50:33.541 --> 1:50:34.541
Yuan Shao?

1:50:36.333 --> 1:50:39.875
Yuan Shao foresaw that the Han Dynasty
will fall sooner or later.

1:50:39.958 --> 1:50:41.625
Only fools will help the Han Dynasty.

1:50:42.666 --> 1:50:45.416
So he didn't help
and he also didn't seize it.

1:50:45.500 --> 1:50:48.458
He just saved his energy
and observed the situation.

1:50:48.541 --> 1:50:49.708
He's not considered a hero.

1:50:54.125 --> 1:50:58.416
Then it's Sun Jian,
who fought so hard with his elite men?

1:51:06.250 --> 1:51:08.500
Sun Jian found the imperial seal
and went back to Jiangdong

1:51:08.583 --> 1:51:11.666
-to plan how to conquer the nation.
-Reporting!

1:51:15.583 --> 1:51:17.041
Congratulations, Father.

1:51:17.125 --> 1:51:18.166
Congratulations, Father.

1:51:18.250 --> 1:51:19.875
Congratulations, my lord.

1:51:19.958 --> 1:51:20.875
It's a shame

1:51:21.583 --> 1:51:25.583
that the one who holds the imperial seal
will be a target of those vying for power.

1:51:26.583 --> 1:51:29.708
I think he's just not smart enough.

1:51:29.791 --> 1:51:32.208
The 18 warlords
who wanted to defeat Dong Zhuo

1:51:32.291 --> 1:51:35.166
have now gone back
to build up their own power.

1:51:35.250 --> 1:51:38.333
They're all eyeing this period of chaos
and hoping to profit from it.

1:51:38.416 --> 1:51:40.583
Not only that,

1:51:41.333 --> 1:51:44.125
when the nation falls apart,

1:51:44.208 --> 1:51:46.166
they all want to get the biggest piece.

1:51:46.250 --> 1:51:48.708
I hope the Han Dynasty can surpass this

1:51:49.791 --> 1:51:51.583
and restore its former glory.

1:51:54.125 --> 1:51:57.708
After so many setbacks,
the Han Dynasty only exists by name.

1:51:58.500 --> 1:52:02.583
We've entered a chaotic,
feudalistic era now.

1:52:04.583 --> 1:52:09.416
Who else do you think
can be called a hero?

1:52:12.416 --> 1:52:14.208
I really can't think of anyone else.

1:52:14.708 --> 1:52:19.000
A hero must have great ambitions
and good intentions.

1:52:19.083 --> 1:52:22.541
He must be magnanimous
and possess great wisdom.

1:52:24.416 --> 1:52:25.708
In my opinion,

1:52:26.291 --> 1:52:27.500
only you

1:52:28.166 --> 1:52:29.291
and I

1:52:29.875 --> 1:52:30.750
are heroes.

1:52:30.833 --> 1:52:33.041
As an official of the Han Dynasty,

1:52:35.083 --> 1:52:37.458
how can you have aspirations
for the throne?

1:52:48.583 --> 1:52:49.958
Stop pretending.

1:52:50.791 --> 1:52:52.541
Isn't that what you want too?

1:53:00.583 --> 1:53:01.583
Actually,

1:53:02.583 --> 1:53:04.375
we're the same.

1:53:08.958 --> 1:53:10.291
I'm helping the Han Dynasty.

1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:12.708
I'm not like you all.

1:53:18.833 --> 1:53:21.458
Do you know
what your two strongest points are?

1:53:22.125 --> 1:53:23.333
The first is loyalty.

1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:25.000
The second

1:53:25.708 --> 1:53:27.583
is your calm facade

1:53:28.208 --> 1:53:30.208
when you tell a lie.

1:53:31.666 --> 1:53:33.375
I hope

1:53:33.458 --> 1:53:35.333
that we will remain friends in the future.

1:53:36.666 --> 1:53:38.583
As long as you are loyal
to the Han Dynasty,

1:53:39.666 --> 1:53:41.416
you'll always be my friend.

1:53:48.458 --> 1:53:51.916
Only by conquering the world,
can one achieve lasting peace.

1:53:53.083 --> 1:53:53.958
Go!
