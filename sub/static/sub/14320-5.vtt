I am Phoenix!

(XAVIER SCREAMING)

00:14.500 --> 00:16.875
Who are you?

00:25.458 --> 00:27.125
That ain't Xavier.

00:27.125 --> 00:29.708
I created the X-Men!

00:29.708 --> 00:32.250
And what I created,

00:32.250 --> 00:35.166
I can destroy!

00:38.750 --> 00:41.875
Until I regain control
of my subconscious,

00:41.875 --> 00:44.875
my orders
cannot be trusted.

00:44.875 --> 00:47.166
My name is Lilandra.

00:47.166 --> 00:49.000
Why have
you come here?

00:49.000 --> 00:52.250
I am the sister of D'Ken,
the emperor of the Shi'ar.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.250
I served
my brother loyally,

00:54.250 --> 00:56.208
until I learned that
he sought to control

00:56.208 --> 00:58.416
the greatest power
in the universe,

00:58.416 --> 01:00.583
the ancient
Crystal of M'Kraan.

01:00.583 --> 01:03.333
My brother hopes
to harness
the crystal's power

01:03.333 --> 01:05.458
to use it
as a weapon.

01:05.458 --> 01:07.583
It is written that
if the crystal
is breached,

01:07.583 --> 01:10.000
both of our galaxies
could be at risk.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.833
The name's Juggernaut,
dear brother!

01:13.833 --> 01:17.583
And you must be
Lilandra!

01:17.583 --> 01:19.500

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:21.125 --> 02:23.250
BANSHEE: Does he not
still love you, Moira?

02:23.250 --> 02:26.375
I dunnae think so,
but he needs me.

02:26.375 --> 02:30.333
Charles has given
everything for
his students, his X-Men.

02:30.333 --> 02:33.125
But friends, aye,
that's different.

02:33.125 --> 02:36.333
Sometimes I think
I'm the only one
he has.

02:43.208 --> 02:46.000
XAVIER: No!

02:46.000 --> 02:48.833
That's Charles!
He's having
another attack.

02:48.833 --> 02:51.250
Wait, Moira!
I'll go with you.

02:51.250 --> 02:54.708
No, Sean. His dark side
may have taken over again.

02:54.708 --> 02:58.875
He might attack you
out of jealousy for what
you and I have together.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.625
It's because I love you,
Moira McTaggart,

03:02.625 --> 03:04.875
that I cannot let you
face trouble alone.

03:07.833 --> 03:09.125
LILANDRA: Stop it!

03:09.125 --> 03:10.458
(GROANS)

03:10.458 --> 03:13.833
This is more fun
than bumper cars.

03:13.833 --> 03:15.958
Leave Charles
alone!

03:15.958 --> 03:17.875
Or what, honeybunch?

03:17.875 --> 03:20.250
You're gonna give me
a spanking?

03:20.250 --> 03:22.333
I warned you!

03:22.333 --> 03:25.625
Oh, please!
Don't warn me.

03:25.625 --> 03:30.250
It's no use, Lilandra.
His body is invulnerable.

03:30.250 --> 03:34.083
But not his mind.
Aim for the helmet.
Full power!

03:46.083 --> 03:47.875
(GROANS)

03:47.875 --> 03:50.708
Don't make me mad,
sweetheart.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.583
(GROANING)

03:53.583 --> 03:55.583
It ain't healthy.

03:55.583 --> 03:59.750
You see,
I crush insects
that bother me,

03:59.750 --> 04:02.750
especially when
they know my brother.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.000
Cain!

04:04.000 --> 04:07.083
I am in your mind.

04:07.083 --> 04:10.750
Feel the ruin
and the pain
you have caused.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.000
Get out of my head!

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
(GROANING)

04:20.000 --> 04:25.166
You are strong, Juggernaut,
but my mind is stronger.

04:25.166 --> 04:27.125
(GROANING)

04:28.125 --> 04:29.458
(GROANS)

04:30.875 --> 04:34.333
Sure, and you should've
watched your back,
Charles Xavier.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.958
(GRUNTING)

04:40.458 --> 04:43.625
You've wasted enough time
smashing around
like a great beast.

04:43.625 --> 04:46.750
Now, get the woman,
and we can name our price.

04:46.750 --> 04:51.833
Maybe you came here
for the money, Tom, but
I came here for one reason,

04:51.833 --> 04:54.208
my do-gooder
half-brother.

04:54.208 --> 04:58.458
There's something
I've wanted to say to you
for a long time,

04:58.458 --> 05:00.708
so long, Chuck!

05:07.125 --> 05:09.000
It's Charles!

05:09.000 --> 05:11.708
(SCREAMING)

05:15.416 --> 05:17.000
(GROANING)

05:17.000 --> 05:19.416
It's all right
now, Charles.

05:19.416 --> 05:20.625
(SIGHING)

05:20.625 --> 05:23.291
Moira?
Where's Lilandra?

05:23.291 --> 05:24.708
What have they
done with her?

05:24.708 --> 05:29.125
She came to me
from the depths of space.

05:29.125 --> 05:31.125
Juggernaut was going
to hurt her.

05:31.125 --> 05:35.958
I tried to stop him,
but someone ambushed me
from behind.

05:35.958 --> 05:38.625
I've never seen him
like this.

05:38.625 --> 05:40.958
There's no one
here, Charles.

05:40.958 --> 05:43.000
No one
has been here.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.583
You came to me
because you feared
you were losing control,

05:46.583 --> 05:50.500
struggling against
an illusion created
by your dark side.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.250
You must believe me!
I'm not going mad.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.458
I know Lilandra is real.

05:55.458 --> 05:57.416
How do you know?

05:57.416 --> 06:00.416
Because I love her, Moira.

06:02.416 --> 06:05.375
(MOANING)

06:07.708 --> 06:08.750
Jean!

06:08.750 --> 06:12.291
Phoenix, now we are one.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.000
(MOANING)

06:17.000 --> 06:20.708
What's happening to you, Jean?
What's gonna happen to us?

06:22.125 --> 06:25.000
Has there been any change
in Jean's condition?

06:25.000 --> 06:29.208
No. Her strange new powers
are still surfacing.

06:29.208 --> 06:32.750
She can't speak,
but Phoenix can.

06:32.750 --> 06:35.875
It should have been me
trying to fly that shuttle.

06:35.875 --> 06:37.750
With my powers,
I might have been
able to...

06:37.750 --> 06:40.000
Chere,you can't
blame yourself.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.375
You were out
on a mission.

06:41.375 --> 06:43.250
You can't be
everywhere at once.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.625
I should have
been there.

06:44.625 --> 06:46.083
WOLVERINE:
Everybody, listen up!

06:46.083 --> 06:48.083
The Professor just called
from Muir Island.

06:48.083 --> 06:50.875
He says an alien
transported down to him,

06:50.875 --> 06:53.083
but was kidnapped
by Juggernaut.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.708
He wants us
to go there to help.

06:54.708 --> 06:56.750
Oh! He's worse off
than we thought.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.583
I can't leave Jean.

06:58.583 --> 07:01.625
You ain't the only one
worried about Jean.

07:01.625 --> 07:04.958
Aliens and spaceships
running around,
messing with Xavier.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.750
The whole blasted world's
turning upside down!

07:07.750 --> 07:09.416
We gotta
do something!

07:09.416 --> 07:12.583
Wolverine, this
is not the time.

07:12.583 --> 07:14.833
I spoke to Moira McTaggart.

07:14.833 --> 07:18.458
She believes the Professor
is suffering
from violent delusions

07:18.458 --> 07:21.375
created
by his dark side.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.083
I say we check it out.

07:23.083 --> 07:25.000
But Professor Xavier
told us

07:25.000 --> 07:27.583
it would be dangerous
to follow his orders.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.333
Wolverine is right.

07:29.333 --> 07:31.375
The Professor's story
has to be checked out.

07:31.375 --> 07:33.083
I don't believe
my ears.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.750
We've seen
more strange things

07:34.750 --> 07:36.708
than Dr. McTaggart
can imagine.

07:36.708 --> 07:38.458
We may need to help
Beast at the mansion

07:38.458 --> 07:41.000
if he and Dr. Corbeau
locate the alien spacecraft

07:41.000 --> 07:42.416
that came through
the vortex.

07:42.416 --> 07:44.416
Storm and I
will wait here.

07:44.416 --> 07:48.208
I don't know why,
but I believe
what's happening to Jean

07:48.208 --> 07:51.000
may hold the answer
to all of
our questions.

07:58.333 --> 07:59.875
Where is the man?

08:01.750 --> 08:05.375
He said he'd pay
for quick results, but now
he doesn't show up!

08:09.291 --> 08:12.000
I've come for
the Princess Lilandra.

08:13.333 --> 08:18.208
If it's the lady you mean,
you'll see her
after I'm paid.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.583
(LAUGHING)

08:19.583 --> 08:22.000

(GRUNTS)

08:23.875 --> 08:25.416

08:25.416 --> 08:28.875
Now where
is Lilandra?

08:28.875 --> 08:34.000
Speak, or you shall feel
my weapon's full power.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.416
(EXCLAIMS)

08:35.416 --> 08:38.875
I don't haggle
with runts like you.

08:38.875 --> 08:41.000
Pay the man!

08:41.000 --> 08:45.125
Or do I have to squeeze
the money out
through your ears?

08:45.125 --> 08:47.291
No! Stop!

08:47.291 --> 08:50.375
You shall get that
which you are due.

08:54.750 --> 08:57.625
Oh! You wanna
play ball, huh?

08:57.625 --> 08:59.583
(CHUCKLING)
Well, catch!

08:59.583 --> 09:03.166
I'll mop the floor
with the whole bunch of you!

09:03.166 --> 09:06.875
Juggernaut, stop!
Business before pleasure.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.708
How about it,
Eric, me boy?
A sum was promised.

09:12.708 --> 09:14.250
I shall pay.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.875
You shouldn't
have come.

09:37.875 --> 09:40.875
Your presence
will only reinforce
Charles' delusions.

09:40.875 --> 09:44.458
Back off, lady.
Charles said
he needed us.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.291
There's a lot about
this outer space mumbo jumbo

09:47.291 --> 09:48.875
that nobody knows,

09:48.875 --> 09:50.875
except maybe
the Professor.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.166
Dr. McTaggart should know
what's best for her...

09:53.166 --> 09:56.083
Hey! Someone needs to
teach you some manners.

09:57.333 --> 09:58.458
Uh-oh!

09:58.458 --> 10:00.708
Plenty have tried, pal.

10:02.125 --> 10:05.000
Fighting won't help
cure Charles'
hallucinations.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.166
If he's seeing things.

10:07.166 --> 10:10.833
I can tell you for sure
if the Professor's
crazy or not.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.625
Ten million dollars.

10:23.625 --> 10:28.208
It has such a lovely
round sound
with all those zeros.

10:28.208 --> 10:31.166
Yes, yes, you have
your meaningless money,

10:31.166 --> 10:32.958
now bring
Lilandra here.

10:32.958 --> 10:34.875

10:34.875 --> 10:37.708
That would be me partner
with the lady now.

10:41.416 --> 10:43.708
She's still a bit
under the weather,

10:43.708 --> 10:47.083
but you didn't specify
what condition
she had to be in,

10:47.083 --> 10:49.750
long as
she was breathing.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.625
She shall
answer to me.

10:52.625 --> 10:54.875
(GROANING)

10:56.958 --> 11:01.625
A pleasure
to see you again,
Your Highness.

11:01.625 --> 11:05.500
Shakari! One of
my brother's spies.

11:05.500 --> 11:10.208
On this miserable planet,
I'm known as Eric the Red.

11:10.208 --> 11:14.333
And you, Princess,
are my deliverance
from this wasteland.

11:14.333 --> 11:18.250
Tell me where
the M'Kraan Crystal is,

11:18.250 --> 11:20.750

11:37.875 --> 11:40.166
I'd know that stink
anywhere.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.875
There were three of them.

11:41.875 --> 11:45.375
Juggernaut and two
I never smelled before.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.250
One ain't even human.

11:47.250 --> 11:51.708
Then Charles
wasn't imagining things.
Someone was here!

11:51.708 --> 11:55.333
Lilandra!
Where are you?

11:55.333 --> 11:57.458
I know you're close.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.458
Why do you not
answer me?

12:02.458 --> 12:05.833
You are attempting
to contact someone!

(GROANS)

12:12.458 --> 12:14.458

12:14.458 --> 12:20.333
I saw a stag and a dragon.

(GROANS)

12:25.125 --> 12:27.000
It makes no sense.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.166
Xavier's woman
is no illusion.
I know where she is.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.958
What do you mean,
you know
where she is?

12:35.958 --> 12:39.250
A stag fighting a dragon
is the Cassidy family crest.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.833
My family.

12:41.833 --> 12:45.833
It's carved in stone
above the hearth in the
Great Hall of Cassidy Keep.

12:45.833 --> 12:49.458
She may have had time
to contact
Professor Xavier

12:49.458 --> 12:52.291
and that mutant
rabble of his,
the X-Men.

12:52.291 --> 12:54.583
She didn't contact nobody.

12:54.583 --> 12:59.458

you should hear me sing.

we're no match

13:57.208 --> 14:00.458
Sounds like
the lord of the castle
has come home

14:00.458 --> 14:02.291
to be buried.

14:02.291 --> 14:05.333
It'll be my pleasure.

14:09.250 --> 14:13.083
You've disgraced
the Cassidy family for
the last time, Black Tom!

14:13.083 --> 14:16.875
And you've stood
in my way too long,
big brother!

14:22.708 --> 14:23.875
There's the woman!

14:27.625 --> 14:30.333
Way to deal him
out of the game, Gambit!

14:30.333 --> 14:31.458
Oh, no!

14:35.500 --> 14:37.083
Ow!

14:37.083 --> 14:38.875
Hands off, fat boy!

14:42.166 --> 14:45.291
You must be Lilandra.
Chuck sends
you his best.

14:45.291 --> 14:46.875
Whatever you do,
don't move.

14:46.875 --> 14:49.375
(GROANS)

14:49.375 --> 14:52.250
Nobody gets the lady
without paying for her!

14:56.875 --> 14:59.500
Your powers never
could hurt me,
little brother.

14:59.500 --> 15:03.708
Nor could yours hurt me.
Fists usually settle things.

15:03.708 --> 15:06.000
Aye, my fists!

15:20.208 --> 15:21.625
Leave Rogue alone!

15:21.625 --> 15:23.333
(EXCLAIMING)

15:26.125 --> 15:27.708
(CHUCKLING)
That tickles!

15:32.625 --> 15:35.250
Gambit teach you
some respect
for a lady!

15:35.250 --> 15:36.625
(GROANS)

15:38.000 --> 15:41.458
Forget these freaks!
We must get
Lilandra to my ship.

15:41.458 --> 15:44.208
(GRUNTING)

15:47.083 --> 15:48.458
No!

16:00.708 --> 16:02.333
(GRUNTING)

16:02.333 --> 16:06.708
(GRUNTING) We can't
let them get to the ship.

16:06.708 --> 16:07.875
(YELLS)

16:07.875 --> 16:09.416
They won't!

16:14.500 --> 16:16.166
(GROANS)

16:16.166 --> 16:17.750
Let Lilandra go.

16:23.625 --> 16:27.250
The X-Men
should have learned
they can't stop me.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.583
(SNARLS)

16:32.708 --> 16:36.875
Those who stand against
the will of the Emperor
must be destroyed.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.416
(THUNDER CLAPPING)

16:41.875 --> 16:43.416
They're coming out
of the woodwork!

16:49.208 --> 16:50.583
ERIC THE RED:
Gladiator!

16:50.583 --> 16:53.083
It is an honor to welcome

16:53.083 --> 16:56.583
the leader of the
Emperor's Praetorian Guard.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.125
You have no honor!

16:59.125 --> 17:01.833
Your bungling
has displeased
the Emperor.

17:01.833 --> 17:04.833
You were ordered to have
Lilandra and the crystal
in your possession

17:04.833 --> 17:06.333
to greet the Emperor.

17:06.333 --> 17:09.583
He comes soon.
Why aren't they ready?

17:09.583 --> 17:10.833
I...

17:10.833 --> 17:12.333
I have Lilandra.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.708
But where is
the M'Kraan Crystal?

17:14.708 --> 17:15.833
(GRUNTS)

17:15.833 --> 17:17.958
You are a warrior
of honor!

17:17.958 --> 17:21.250
Why do you serve
a madman
like my brother?

17:21.250 --> 17:25.208
Princess, I serve
the imperial throne
of the Shi'ar

17:25.208 --> 17:28.125
and D'Ken
sits on the throne.

17:28.125 --> 17:31.958
Why are we listening
to Mr. Bad Hair Day?

17:31.958 --> 17:34.625
Why don't you just
flit back where you...

17:34.625 --> 17:36.208
Huh?

17:36.208 --> 17:38.125
(GROANING)

17:40.458 --> 17:43.583
(EXCLAIMING)

17:47.500 --> 17:49.458
Wow!

17:49.458 --> 17:52.000
I didn't think
anybody could do that
to Juggernaut.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.208
Nobody from Earth.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.458
You will come
with me, Princess.

17:57.458 --> 18:01.500
Not without a fight,
she won't!
She's a friend of mine.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.625
(ALL GRUNTING)

18:12.083 --> 18:13.583
(GROANS)

18:13.583 --> 18:17.083
Take her
with my respects
to the Emperor.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.375
(GRUNTING)

18:18.375 --> 18:19.750
I am sorry, Princess,

18:19.750 --> 18:21.875
but you must give
your brother the crystal.

18:22.875 --> 18:28.583
No! For the sake
of the universe, no!

18:28.583 --> 18:34.208
Lilandra!
Save her, my X-Men!
You must save Lilandra!

18:34.208 --> 18:37.625
Lilandra! I must go
to Cassidy Keep.

18:37.625 --> 18:40.708
The fate of the galaxy
hangs in the balance.

18:40.708 --> 18:42.583
Jean, what are
you talking about?

18:42.583 --> 18:44.375
You're in no condition
to go anywhere!

18:44.375 --> 18:46.500
PHOENIX: Phoenix must go!

18:52.291 --> 18:55.416
Jean! Jean!

19:00.083 --> 19:03.291
Lilandra is under
my protection.

19:03.291 --> 19:04.416
Depart!

19:04.416 --> 19:06.208
What? What is it?

19:06.208 --> 19:09.291
There is no way
you can stop me.

19:23.583 --> 19:28.875
Creature, no one defies
the will of the Emperor
of the Shi'ar and lives.

19:28.875 --> 19:32.375
My powers are
his to command,
and they are invincible.

19:34.166 --> 19:37.166
If you will serve
no worthy master,

19:37.166 --> 19:40.000
then learn the power
of Phoenix.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.875
(SCREAMING IN PAIN)

19:43.875 --> 19:47.000
You may survive
to tell your master

19:47.000 --> 19:49.708
to abandon his evil quest
for the crystal.

19:53.583 --> 19:56.833
(SCREAMING)

20:01.208 --> 20:02.875
Are you the child
of the crystal?

20:02.875 --> 20:04.583
Yes.

20:04.583 --> 20:07.333
You are the Phoenix
the legends spoke of,

20:07.333 --> 20:10.291
the guardian of
the M'Kraan Crystal.

20:10.291 --> 20:13.083
You must help me
to keep the crystal

20:13.083 --> 20:16.500
from falling into the hands
of my brother, the Emperor!

20:16.500 --> 20:18.958
-He is here.
-Where?

20:18.958 --> 20:20.416
There.

20:33.583 --> 20:37.500
The crystal is here.
I can feel its power.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.583
(LAUGHING)

20:52.583 --> 20:57.625
