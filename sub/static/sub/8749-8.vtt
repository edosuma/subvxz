00:05.850 --> 00:08.315
I saw, like, two graves.

00:08.316 --> 00:11.492
That spirit told me, I'll be back.

00:11.493 --> 00:14.708
They are cutting off his skin on his face.

00:14.709 --> 00:17.734
It is kind of creepy, some
dead person in your house.

00:17.735 --> 00:20.637
He's just screaming and losing it.

00:20.638 --> 00:23.189
He had a run-in with the Ku Klux Klan.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.774
So the Klan tarred and feathered him.

00:25.775 --> 00:28.327
These men started dying horrible deaths.

00:28.328 --> 00:31.568
He was not a good guy.

00:32.842 --> 00:35.422
So he's dead.

00:36.601 --> 00:39.514
My name is Amy Allan.

00:39.515 --> 00:41.512
There's something down there.

00:41.513 --> 00:42.937
I see dead people.

00:42.938 --> 00:44.882
He doesn't want me back there.

00:44.883 --> 00:47.057
I speak to dead people...

00:47.058 --> 00:48.420
She's pissed.

00:48.421 --> 00:49.732
And they speak to me.

00:49.733 --> 00:52.098
She doesn't like the people who live here.

00:52.099 --> 00:55.246
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:55.247 --> 00:56.979
Someone did hang themselves here.

00:56.980 --> 00:58.648
- Where?
- There.

00:58.649 --> 01:00.255
I rely on my partner.

01:00.256 --> 01:03.881
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:03.882 --> 01:05.385
Did you want to kill him?

01:05.387 --> 01:09.117
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.118 --> 01:10.652
She did die in this house.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.234
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.235 --> 01:14.596
Would you be surprised if there
were bodies in the basement?

01:14.597 --> 01:15.409
No.

01:15.410 --> 01:16.989
Steve and I never speak...

01:16.990 --> 01:18.924
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.925 --> 01:20.291
Until the very end...

01:20.292 --> 01:21.625
Not good.

01:21.626 --> 01:23.793
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.794 --> 01:24.868
Will it get worse?

01:24.869 --> 01:26.160
Or time to get out.

01:26.161 --> 01:29.041
- Oh, yes.
- Whew.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.913 --> 01:53.080
Steve will conduct his investigation,

01:53.081 --> 01:56.037
without knowing anything
that I've encountered.

01:56.038 --> 02:00.320
He'll uncover as much as he can
about the history of the location.

02:00.321 --> 02:04.624
At the end, we come together
to compare our research.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.848
I'm down here in Key West, Florida.

02:06.849 --> 02:10.863
Now this is a real vacation
spot, a real party town.

02:10.864 --> 02:14.825
But not everybody down here
is having a good time.

02:14.826 --> 02:17.251
I got a call from a woman named Colette.

02:17.252 --> 02:20.726
Now Colette owns a small
home down here in Key West.

02:20.727 --> 02:23.619
Ever since she bought it, she's
had some strange things going on.

02:23.620 --> 02:28.596
Strange feelings, her partner's
seeing things, apparitions.

02:28.597 --> 02:34.497
I'm about to meet with her now and see
if I can get to the bottom of it.

02:48.217 --> 02:51.757
Before I enter a location...

02:53.432 --> 02:59.332
Matt will come in and cover or remove
anything that could be leading information.

02:59.458 --> 03:02.458
And then I come in.

03:25.797 --> 03:29.097
I saw, like, two graves.

03:29.784 --> 03:34.164
There was time between these two deaths.

03:34.536 --> 03:38.496
I feel like they knew each other.

03:40.346 --> 03:45.183
It was like a betrayal from
a lot of these people.

03:45.184 --> 03:51.084
And they are cutting on his face and
they're cutting off his skin on his face.

03:57.995 --> 04:02.075
He's, like, now in a violent rage.

04:02.084 --> 04:06.720
He's throwing a chair.
He's smashing things.

04:06.721 --> 04:12.121
And he's just screaming.
He's just, like, losing it.

04:33.908 --> 04:35.196
Colette?

04:35.197 --> 04:37.235
- Yes. Steve?
- Yeah, how are you?

04:37.236 --> 04:42.696
- Come on in. Welcome to my home.
- All right, thanks.

04:44.047 --> 04:47.858
Ever since I moved in, I
felt someone was here.

04:47.859 --> 04:50.412
I knew that I wasn't alone.

04:50.413 --> 04:55.510
There was other spirits or
something here in the house.

04:55.511 --> 04:58.658
And it's been that way ever
since I've lived here.

04:58.659 --> 05:01.740
- When did you move in?
- It's been less than a year ago.

05:01.741 --> 05:03.947
- Okay.
- And there's different things going on.

05:03.948 --> 05:06.838
I feel cold spots everywhere.

05:06.839 --> 05:10.508
But I don't see anything. I
don't hear anything, really.

05:10.509 --> 05:15.155
It just felt like someone else is in
the room but you couldn't see him.

05:15.156 --> 05:18.607
I know it's a dead person.

05:18.608 --> 05:22.655
I just would appreciate if you
could get to the bottom of this.

05:22.656 --> 05:27.726
All right, so you thought to yourself
that that chill was a being of some sort.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.495
- Something, yes.
- Okay.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.699
And you feel them, and it's
almost like they're right on you,

05:32.700 --> 05:36.840
just a drastic change in temperature.

05:36.902 --> 05:39.250
Why don't you explain to me
how the temperature changes?

05:39.251 --> 05:42.473
I mean, how exactly do you feel it?
What happens?

05:42.474 --> 05:46.077
It's like a major cold blast.
I'm frozen to the bone.

05:46.078 --> 05:48.622
And it's only in spots.

05:48.623 --> 05:52.395
Now when do you feel it mostly? Is it
when you're up and walking around or when

05:52.396 --> 05:55.433
you're sitting still, and all of a
sudden it gets cold, describe it to me.

05:55.434 --> 05:57.894
A lot of times, right here in this corner,

05:57.895 --> 06:00.763
I'll be sitting right here on the
couch, and it's like I'm freezing.

06:00.764 --> 06:04.021
I go get another sweatshirt on.
And it's hot outside.

06:04.022 --> 06:05.046
Yeah, it's hot here.

06:05.047 --> 06:07.719
It is kind of creepy
when you think about it,

06:07.720 --> 06:12.220
you know, some dead person in your house.

06:18.748 --> 06:20.979
There's people...

06:20.980 --> 06:23.680
Two main people.

06:24.048 --> 06:27.108
There's a male. Hmm.

06:27.273 --> 06:30.753
He wanted to hurt somebody.

06:38.796 --> 06:40.656
Hmm.

06:42.532 --> 06:45.712
Let's go to the back.

06:49.633 --> 06:52.813
There's more out here.

06:54.345 --> 06:57.945
He's had, like, something
that really bothered him.

06:57.946 --> 07:02.926
Like, a lot of anger.
Got to get rid of that.

07:09.358 --> 07:12.486
Well, basically, I feel things.

07:12.487 --> 07:14.953
And my partner Glen sees things.

07:14.954 --> 07:17.054
- Now...
- Throughout the house.

07:17.055 --> 07:18.875
- He sees things?
- Yes.

07:18.876 --> 07:24.158
Glen sees all this activity,
people walking through the house.

07:24.159 --> 07:26.065
And it's just weird.

07:26.066 --> 07:28.258
Now Glen is... he stays here with you or...

07:28.259 --> 07:32.363
Yeah, he's my partner.
He's a treasure hunter.

07:32.364 --> 07:34.447
He actually sees him.

07:34.448 --> 07:37.464
He'll say, you know, there's bunch
of activity going on today, Colette.

07:37.465 --> 07:39.578
I can't believe you don't see these people.

07:39.579 --> 07:43.315
I mean, it's not just one or two people.
He sees several.

07:43.316 --> 07:44.207
Okay.

07:44.208 --> 07:47.160
I think I really didn't
pay attention until...

07:47.161 --> 07:51.361
Glen came back from his salvage work.

07:51.593 --> 07:56.873
It just seemed to be stronger
or happen more often.

07:57.283 --> 08:00.210
- You think Glen might have...
- Brought? I don't know.

08:00.211 --> 08:02.578
He could have brought something from...
I don't know.

08:02.579 --> 08:06.798
How do I know he's not bringing other
spirits with him into this home?

08:06.799 --> 08:09.325
I don't know how these
things work, to be honest.

08:09.326 --> 08:15.086
But it'd be nice to know
what's going on in this house.

08:15.203 --> 08:19.063
Since I can't base an investigation
on cold chills and creepy feelings,

08:19.064 --> 08:21.265
I'm gonna talk to Colette's partner Glen.

08:21.266 --> 08:26.306
He may be able to provide
a partial description.

08:33.077 --> 08:37.837
Glen, you've seen some things in the
house that Colette hasn't seen.

08:37.837 --> 08:40.082
Can you go into an
explanation of what you saw?

08:40.083 --> 08:43.707
A lot of times... nighttime,
daytime, doesn't matter...

08:43.708 --> 08:46.873
I'll be sitting on the
couch on the computer,

08:46.874 --> 08:50.584
and I'll see movement out the corner of
my eye, and I'll look over in the hall,

08:50.585 --> 08:54.005
and there will be a form.

08:55.600 --> 08:59.302
I've seen one primary figure many times.

08:59.303 --> 09:03.719
And every once in a while, there
were other individuals with him.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.542
- So you know it's a male.
- Yeah.

09:05.543 --> 09:07.306
- Now are all of them males?
- Yeah.

09:07.307 --> 09:10.672
I saw the one person a lot, and
he wasn't particularly friendly.

09:10.673 --> 09:11.485
Okay.

09:11.486 --> 09:16.594
But I just saw the head turn, and he kept
right on going, never missed a step.

09:16.595 --> 09:18.527
Do they look like they
were looking for something

09:18.528 --> 09:20.156
or is it just they were walking through?

09:20.157 --> 09:22.864
I swear, I don't know, but
they walk through a lot,

09:22.865 --> 09:25.148
back and forth, back and
forth, back and forth.

09:25.149 --> 09:27.621
And it's like they were on
a mission, so to speak.

09:27.622 --> 09:32.482
- Okay.
- I don't have an explanation for it.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.740
There was, like, just a little pathway,

09:36.741 --> 09:42.441
like a tiny little worn path
from somebody walking a lot.

09:44.910 --> 09:49.023
He could build things and make
things or tear them down.

09:49.024 --> 09:51.789
And he tore this down, and
that gives him satisfaction.

09:51.790 --> 09:55.150
He feels good about that.

09:56.561 --> 09:59.096
There's some kind of conflict here.

09:59.097 --> 10:01.977
Somebody's arguing.

10:05.436 --> 10:08.303
He kind of got off on...

10:08.304 --> 10:11.233
People fighting. He likes to hurt people.

10:11.234 --> 10:14.474
He was not a good guy.

10:17.401 --> 10:19.654
Is there any clothing you could
describe or is it just...

10:19.655 --> 10:20.554
Yeah.

10:20.555 --> 10:25.955
I saw white-colored slacks
and a light-colored shirt.

10:28.326 --> 10:29.801
Can you describe him?

10:29.802 --> 10:34.196
There was kind of like a white day outfit.

10:34.197 --> 10:35.794
A white linen shirt.

10:35.795 --> 10:38.773
And a pair of white...

10:38.774 --> 10:41.174
Linen pants.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.416
His hair is cut short.

10:44.417 --> 10:47.612
I really don't know how to describe
his face but I can see it.

10:47.613 --> 10:50.548
And for some reason, I think
he's about 5'10 or 11.

10:50.549 --> 10:53.084
Could you pick him out of a lineup?

10:53.085 --> 10:56.205
Yeah, without a doubt.

10:57.856 --> 11:00.227
The person is...

11:00.228 --> 11:01.603
5'10.

11:01.604 --> 11:03.919
Maybe hazel eyes?

11:03.920 --> 11:05.693
And a hat sometimes.

11:05.694 --> 11:08.799
Actually kind of round.

11:08.800 --> 11:13.360
And a ribbon around it, like a straw hat.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.901
Did you ever experience anything like this

11:15.902 --> 11:18.381
prior to coming and staying
here with Colette?

11:18.382 --> 11:20.190
Yeah.

11:20.191 --> 11:21.070
All my life.

11:21.071 --> 11:24.043
What you've experienced in the
past, was it the same persons

11:24.044 --> 11:26.757
or are these totally some
different figures of...

11:26.758 --> 11:28.108
Different, different things.

11:28.109 --> 11:30.245
I could walk in somebody's house and...

11:30.246 --> 11:33.088
And I would see something
pass through the kitchen,

11:33.089 --> 11:36.160
then I'd look over there
at that person and it...

11:36.161 --> 11:39.997
You could see through that person.

11:39.998 --> 11:44.753
So Colette doesn't see spirits, and Glen's
been seeing spirits his whole life.

11:44.754 --> 11:48.573
Now I get why she thinks Glen may be
the reason for all this activity.

11:48.574 --> 11:51.172
When I was 20...

11:51.173 --> 11:53.244
And I was at my grandfather's house,

11:53.245 --> 11:56.681
I was going out to the
barn to find something.

11:56.682 --> 12:01.482
And all of a sudden, I
felt absolute terror.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.020
And...

12:03.021 --> 12:07.322
I was cold, chilled, and I was
sweating at the same time.

12:07.323 --> 12:09.327
And I thought something was gonna get me,

12:09.328 --> 12:12.477
and I picked up and I
ran back to the house.

12:12.478 --> 12:16.739
And I was glad to get inside that door.

12:16.740 --> 12:19.503
Evil spirits aren't my area of expertise.

12:19.504 --> 12:23.811
That's Amy's thing, and I won't
know what she finds out till later.

12:23.812 --> 12:27.412
Hopefully, she'll be able to
give Glen some peace of mind.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.001
- The entity found me.
- Okay.

12:30.002 --> 12:32.717
For five years, I fought this thing.

12:32.718 --> 12:35.587
And after five years, it quit.

12:35.588 --> 12:41.488
And it told me, don't be too proud,
big boy, because I'll be back.

12:56.446 --> 13:00.416
This house feels like
it's a hub for the dead.

13:00.417 --> 13:04.723
There's a lot of dead people coming
in and telling me their stories.

13:04.724 --> 13:08.779
And I think they're linked to
the house but I'm not sure how.

13:08.780 --> 13:11.206
He was tortured.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.027
And he was burnt.

13:17.099 --> 13:19.100
It's a man.

13:19.101 --> 13:21.587
This isn't the same guy that I got before.

13:21.588 --> 13:24.168
No, it's not.

13:29.144 --> 13:33.280
It doesn't feel like his home here.

13:33.281 --> 13:36.617
It doesn't feel like he's from here.

13:36.618 --> 13:40.758
This incident happened someplace else.

13:41.432 --> 13:45.512
And this was a very long time ago.

13:48.534 --> 13:52.266
This man is still in his death state.

13:52.267 --> 13:54.967
He looks burned.

13:55.367 --> 13:59.860
But nothing around him shows
any sign of fire damage.

13:59.861 --> 14:04.553
He is in a lot of pain
and was very panicked,

14:04.554 --> 14:10.134
over what happened to him,
very stressed out, very hurt.

14:15.524 --> 14:20.264
- Did he see it coming?
- No, no. He... no.

14:22.668 --> 14:27.178
I located a woman named Renee who
used to live in Colette's house.

14:27.179 --> 14:29.712
If she saw apparitions
when she lived there,

14:29.713 --> 14:32.688
then Glen can't be the
cause of the problem.

14:32.689 --> 14:35.591
As we spoke, I'm doing an
investigation on the house.

14:35.592 --> 14:39.227
And the things that went on
here and are going on here.

14:39.228 --> 14:41.596
I know you lived here at some point.

14:41.597 --> 14:43.098
How long ago was that?

14:43.099 --> 14:46.167
Moved in around 1988 till about 1990.

14:46.168 --> 14:47.949
Okay, so you were here a couple of years.

14:47.950 --> 14:48.830
Mm-hmm.

14:48.831 --> 14:50.479
Do you know any history about the house?

14:50.480 --> 14:53.059
No, I know that most of
these houses were made,

14:53.060 --> 14:55.672
from the cigar owners for
their factory workers.

14:55.673 --> 14:57.279
They're called shotgun houses,

14:57.280 --> 15:00.251
but I don't know about any history
about this particular house.

15:00.252 --> 15:04.452
Now when you were here, did anything
strange happen while you were living here?

15:04.453 --> 15:05.329
No.

15:05.330 --> 15:08.544
- Now did you own it, or did you rent it?
- I rented it.

15:08.545 --> 15:11.387
Did the person you rented it from
say anything about the house?

15:11.388 --> 15:14.508
Did they see anything?

15:14.981 --> 15:16.901
Okay.

15:19.569 --> 15:24.240
Colette thinks Glen is bringing
evil spirits into the house.

15:24.241 --> 15:25.975
Maybe he is.

15:25.976 --> 15:31.076
Or maybe he's the only
one that could see them.

15:32.267 --> 15:34.409
I don't know how that works.

15:34.410 --> 15:38.876
I just need to find out what
happened in that house.

15:38.877 --> 15:43.424
The one interesting thing that happened
on Whitehead Street back in the 1920s.

15:43.425 --> 15:48.704
Was a murder of a man taken refuge
in a house on Whitehead Street

15:48.705 --> 15:51.561
commonly known here as
El Isleno, The Islander.

15:51.562 --> 15:54.736
Manuel Cabeza's his real name.

15:54.737 --> 16:00.637
He had a run in with the Ku Klux Klan
and El Isleno was tarred and feathered.

16:01.077 --> 16:03.777
He was tortured.

16:03.779 --> 16:06.599
And he was burnt.

16:07.808 --> 16:10.463
They actually poured hot tar on
him and stuck feathers on him,

16:10.464 --> 16:13.521
which was a classic way to make
an example of somebody that...

16:13.522 --> 16:19.422
- Literally tarred and feathered?
- Literally tarred and feathered him.

16:20.797 --> 16:25.168
It's almost like they were gangs
or affiliated in some way.

16:25.169 --> 16:27.904
I'm sensing a group of men in this house,

16:27.905 --> 16:32.709
and one of them seems to be
in control of this gathering.

16:32.710 --> 16:37.781
There was a lot of them, lots and
lots and lots and lots of them.

16:37.782 --> 16:42.853
Like, even the ones that did it, there
was way more people even behind them.

16:42.854 --> 16:47.294
That we're all, like, in the same gang.

16:49.631 --> 16:55.531
And I'm getting this one guy in particular
who is kind of the head of the thing.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.471
And the men are wearing...

17:00.472 --> 17:05.031
I don't know, they're weird-looking hats.

17:05.868 --> 17:10.210
I feel like they were dressed the same.

17:10.211 --> 17:12.781
And they're all the same race.

17:12.782 --> 17:15.942
How are they organized?

17:15.943 --> 17:20.623
There was a hierarchy. Men, a bunch of men.

17:22.439 --> 17:25.986
So this torture was committed by a
bunch of racist thugs from the KKK,

17:25.987 --> 17:29.226
on the same block as Colette's place.

17:29.227 --> 17:33.037
Manuel Cabeza was living
with a mixed-race woman,

17:33.038 --> 17:38.343
which the locals and in particular
the Ku Klux Klan disapproved of.

17:38.344 --> 17:40.617
- And how long ago was this?
- Nineteen twenty one.

17:40.618 --> 17:44.938
He was beaten and tarred and feathered.

17:46.533 --> 17:50.332
He's fascinated, fixated on something.

17:50.333 --> 17:54.473
I got to take care of this problem.

17:54.860 --> 17:58.400
He is plotting and planning.

17:59.852 --> 18:03.033
There are two distinct
entities in this house.

18:03.034 --> 18:08.439
One is the burned man who's trying to
show me what happened when he died.

18:08.440 --> 18:12.476
And one is the man in
white who is so angry,

18:12.477 --> 18:16.977
I can't even really communicate with him.

18:18.350 --> 18:21.559
He's in the shadows. He's waiting.
He's watching.

18:21.560 --> 18:26.780
It doesn't really matter
what the consequences are.

18:33.332 --> 18:36.004
So the Klan tarred and feathered him.

18:36.005 --> 18:39.538
After that, he, of course, wanted
revenge because he's the tough guy,

18:39.539 --> 18:41.364
and he has to live up his reputation.

18:41.365 --> 18:43.921
So the head of the Klan was William Decker.

18:43.922 --> 18:47.539
So Decker was driving down Duval Street,

18:47.540 --> 18:52.084
and Manuel Cabeza jumped on the
running board and killed him.

18:52.085 --> 18:57.245
Shot him in the back of
the head and killed him.

19:07.369 --> 19:09.589
Craziness.

19:10.770 --> 19:15.930
Somebody's yelling. Something
is being thrown down.

19:16.185 --> 19:19.013
He's just losing it, just going berserk.

19:19.014 --> 19:22.314
He's really, really mad.

19:38.088 --> 19:40.308
Craziness.

19:41.218 --> 19:46.378
Somebody's yelling. Something
is being thrown down.

19:46.823 --> 19:49.759
He's just losing it, just going berserk.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.861
He's really, really mad.

19:52.862 --> 19:56.168
There's an endless cycle
of hatred and revenge.

19:56.169 --> 20:00.267
That's being played out over
and over again in this area.

20:00.268 --> 20:05.548
This house has somehow trapped
that emotional energy.

20:05.752 --> 20:09.172
This man... killed someone?

20:13.756 --> 20:16.510
Manuel Cabeza killed Decker.

20:16.511 --> 20:19.188
- He shoots him in the head...
- Then he takes off...

20:19.189 --> 20:23.815
To Soldano's grocery store,
and took refuge in there.

20:23.816 --> 20:26.131
And of course, the city
police then was after him,

20:26.132 --> 20:27.752
and the Sheriff was after him.

20:27.753 --> 20:31.004
They know he's in the store now.
They're gonna flush him out.

20:31.005 --> 20:36.760
And there was some gunfire, so El Isleno
agreed to surrender to the Sheriff.

20:36.761 --> 20:39.392
To take him to the County Jail.

20:39.393 --> 20:42.297
A couple blocks farther
down Whitehead Street.

20:42.298 --> 20:46.678
And he's locked up in the County Jail.

20:56.761 --> 20:59.423
In the middle of the night.

20:59.424 --> 21:02.124
He was sleeping.

21:03.046 --> 21:05.026
And...

21:06.019 --> 21:09.619
They put a bag on his head.

21:10.030 --> 21:13.510
And then they beat him up.

21:16.336 --> 21:20.672
Sometimes I encounter dead people
when they're in their death state.

21:20.673 --> 21:26.573
Which means that I am seeing them as
they looked at the moment they died.

21:26.744 --> 21:31.544
They have ropes, like,
with the throat and...

21:36.418 --> 21:40.978
Like, not being able to breathe very well.

21:41.721 --> 21:44.959
The torture ended in killing him.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.540
So he's dead.

21:49.500 --> 21:53.171
So that night, the Ku Klux Klan...

21:53.172 --> 21:55.745
- Okay.
- They surrounded the building.

21:55.746 --> 21:59.098
The scenario, the Sheriff said,
is that he was overpowered.

21:59.099 --> 22:04.999
The KKK first went in and beat this
man and they hung him up to a pole.

22:06.751 --> 22:08.946
What do we know about the
girl he was living with?

22:08.947 --> 22:10.669
You said that she was of mixed race?

22:10.670 --> 22:13.589
We lose Angela after the incident.
We don't know what happened to her.

22:13.590 --> 22:15.030
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:15.031 --> 22:20.931
Basically, all we know is she was
supposedly good-looking and mixed race.

22:27.453 --> 22:30.271
There's, like, a female.

22:30.272 --> 22:34.251
And there's a look of anguish on her face.

22:34.252 --> 22:37.865
She's very adamant about
what they're doing.

22:37.866 --> 22:41.323
And feels strongly about it.

22:41.324 --> 22:43.586
This is unexpected.

22:43.587 --> 22:47.629
She couldn't stop it from happening.

22:47.630 --> 22:51.044
She was trying to make something...

22:51.045 --> 22:54.165
Real that's not real.

22:54.524 --> 22:57.837
This woman is very upset.

22:57.838 --> 23:01.250
She feels like she doesn't have a voice.

23:01.251 --> 23:06.891
Whatever is happening, she
feels like she can't stop it.

23:22.591 --> 23:24.867
The leader of the Ku Klux Klan in Key West,

23:24.868 --> 23:29.730
had Cabeza tortured because he was in love
with a woman of mixed race named Angela.

23:29.731 --> 23:33.325
I need to find out a
little bit more about her.

23:33.326 --> 23:38.292
There's a writer down here who knows
a lot more about the Cabeza case.

23:38.293 --> 23:41.871
Terry, it seems like the person that
there's the least information about

23:41.872 --> 23:45.915
is the girl Angela that the
whole mess happened over.

23:45.916 --> 23:48.083
Now do you have any
information you can give me?

23:48.084 --> 23:50.846
There's not a great deal known about her.

23:50.847 --> 23:53.299
Aside from the fact that
she had been a prostitute,

23:53.300 --> 23:57.347
and that he had fallen in love with
her and taken her into his house.

23:57.348 --> 24:01.266
But we do know that she dabbled in...

24:01.267 --> 24:06.339
Black magic, voodoo, religions that
people here didn't really understand,

24:06.340 --> 24:11.603
and that she had placed a curse on all
of those who attacked Manuel Cabeza.

24:11.604 --> 24:16.284
Angela made a sacrifice,
a voodoo sacrifice.

24:16.606 --> 24:20.995
With chicken bones and feathers and blood,

24:20.996 --> 24:24.708
and called up voodoo spirits from her past.

24:24.709 --> 24:27.529
From her heritage.

24:31.656 --> 24:36.696
The dark-haired lady,
she's not happy about it.

24:38.890 --> 24:41.830
Very strange things.

24:43.635 --> 24:45.855
She is...

24:46.478 --> 24:49.658
Like, raising the dead.

25:03.744 --> 25:08.304
She's very anguished over the whole thing.

25:11.151 --> 25:16.191
The dark-haired lady,
she's not happy about it.

25:17.325 --> 25:19.545
She is...

25:20.442 --> 25:23.622
Like, raising the dead.

25:30.138 --> 25:32.658
Anything more?

25:38.177 --> 25:41.177
I saw, like, graves.

25:45.469 --> 25:49.585
Do you know anything about the
curse she laid on everybody and,

25:49.586 --> 25:50.892
what eventually happened?

25:50.893 --> 25:54.807
Well, we know that Angela
cursed all of the men.

25:54.808 --> 25:58.052
Who had attacked Manuel Cabeza.

25:58.053 --> 26:00.669
It's sort of a disquieting
coincidence that,

26:00.670 --> 26:03.614
not long after Angela placed the curse.

26:03.615 --> 26:07.935
These men started dying horrible deaths.

26:10.498 --> 26:13.849
One of them drowned on a fishing trip.

26:13.850 --> 26:16.809
One of them went missing in a hurricane.

26:16.810 --> 26:22.122
One of them was blown up while
working on the bridges.

26:22.123 --> 26:25.101
The one death that seemed to epitomize,

26:25.102 --> 26:29.309
the curse for a lot of people
was Sheriff Curry himself.

26:29.310 --> 26:33.749
Who was the man who had allowed
the mob to come into the jail.

26:33.750 --> 26:35.997
And remove Manuel Cabeza.

26:35.998 --> 26:41.210
Sheriff Curry... he died a
particularly painful death.

26:41.211 --> 26:46.658
He was crushed underneath his boat
and had to be cut from the wreckage.

26:46.659 --> 26:50.947
And spent his last few
days in unyielding agony.

26:50.948 --> 26:52.715
He died a very painful death,

26:52.716 --> 26:56.316
much as she had wished upon
him and all the others.

26:56.317 --> 26:57.538
Okay.

26:57.539 --> 27:00.897
Some people are convinced that uh...

27:00.898 --> 27:05.398
These men were victims of Angela's curse.

27:17.326 --> 27:21.120
Of the two most prominent
entities that I encountered,

27:21.121 --> 27:23.853
one of them was so badly burned,

27:23.854 --> 27:29.754
that I decided to have the sketch
artist draw the other one.

27:29.841 --> 27:31.475
Remember his eyebrows?

27:31.476 --> 27:37.376
They're not thick, they're not thin,
and there is a slight arch to them.

27:39.472 --> 27:42.185
Were they big eyes, or were they thin?

27:42.186 --> 27:44.403
Slightly almond.

27:44.404 --> 27:46.744
More round.

27:47.515 --> 27:50.941
He has, like, a sad mouth.

27:50.942 --> 27:55.622
- This goes down and were not full.
- This goes down, okay.

27:55.623 --> 27:58.591
- He did freckle.
- He had freckles?

27:58.592 --> 28:02.252
A little bit of a line here.

28:02.730 --> 28:06.391
Do you remember what he had on?
What he was wearing?

28:06.392 --> 28:11.458
Linen pants and then a linen top that
was button-down and short-sleeved.

28:11.459 --> 28:14.489
Regular collar for the shirt.

28:14.490 --> 28:18.944
Like, both were light-colored,
and then he did wear a hat.

28:18.945 --> 28:20.914
It had a round brim.

28:20.915 --> 28:23.281
Oh, sort of like a straw hat?

28:23.282 --> 28:24.884
Yeah.

28:24.885 --> 28:30.225
And it did have a band, and
it was white and blue.

28:31.291 --> 28:34.111
Yeah, that's him.

28:34.701 --> 28:37.161
I locate the killers, the victim,

28:37.162 --> 28:41.133
and even the woman he left behind, all
within blocks of Colette's house.

28:41.134 --> 28:45.344
But I still can't figure out
what ties them all to her house.

28:45.345 --> 28:49.605
I make one last trip to the archives.

28:50.131 --> 28:56.031
And then I find out what ties this
whole crazy story to Colette's house.

29:09.943 --> 29:13.811
I haven't spoken to Amy since
we began this investigation.

29:13.812 --> 29:19.332
And I'm really looking forward
to hearing her findings.

29:25.001 --> 29:28.933
Amy, Colette owns the home, she bought
it about, less than a year ago.

29:28.934 --> 29:32.838
And probably, from the minute
she got her she felt...

29:32.839 --> 29:35.498
A powerful energy.

29:35.499 --> 29:39.148
Glen, on the other hand, has
actually seen apparitions.

29:39.149 --> 29:42.809
One prominent which is a man.

29:43.184 --> 29:46.566
I don't get the sense that
Colette is a sensitive.

29:46.567 --> 29:50.069
But Glen, I think, does have abilities.

29:50.070 --> 29:52.643
- I could see things.
- Mm hmm.

29:52.644 --> 29:56.563
The guy, I could see him
going up and down the hall.

29:56.564 --> 30:01.300
But he can distinctly
recall the man's features.

30:01.301 --> 30:03.854
So I did some investigating on the house.

30:03.855 --> 30:07.337
It does have a long, dark past.

30:07.338 --> 30:12.822
The whole neighborhood, a matter
of fact, has a dark, violent past.

30:12.823 --> 30:16.203
As far as the apparitions
go, I was more or less kind

30:16.204 --> 30:18.247
of concerned about your
walk and what you saw.

30:18.248 --> 30:19.196
Mm-hmm.

30:19.197 --> 30:22.364
Initially, I saw a man in profile.

30:22.365 --> 30:23.901
Initially, with a hat on.

30:23.902 --> 30:27.969
He was a pretty angry... angry man.

30:27.970 --> 30:31.504
He kind of got off on people fighting.

30:31.505 --> 30:34.327
He was not a good guy.

30:34.328 --> 30:37.563
The interesting thing to me is that...

30:37.564 --> 30:40.684
There was another man.

30:40.975 --> 30:43.930
And he seemed very agitated.

30:43.931 --> 30:48.791
I mean, he was just,
frankly, out of control.

30:48.967 --> 30:51.187
Craziness.

30:52.187 --> 30:53.937
Somebody's yelling.

30:53.938 --> 30:56.272
He's just losing it, just going berserk.

30:56.273 --> 30:59.337
He's really, really mad.

30:59.338 --> 31:02.536
He had a lot of issues with a woman.

31:02.537 --> 31:05.524
I'm not exactly sure if
they were married or not,

31:05.525 --> 31:07.847
but they were together for a long time.

31:07.848 --> 31:13.748
He was very afraid and stressed out, and
he kept saying about this large event.

31:13.801 --> 31:17.457
He was very panicked over
what happened to him.

31:17.458 --> 31:20.090
Very stressed out, very hurt.

31:20.091 --> 31:24.226
These men came and they got him.
He didn't know what was happening.

31:24.227 --> 31:27.801
They put a bag over his head,
and then they tortured him.

31:27.802 --> 31:30.709
And he looked burned.

31:30.710 --> 31:33.633
He was missing some of his face.

31:33.634 --> 31:35.816
So he's all...

31:35.817 --> 31:39.168
Just missing skin and just...

31:39.169 --> 31:43.183
It was really... it's really, really bad.

31:43.184 --> 31:46.794
I may be able to clear this whole
thing up as far as the two men.

31:46.795 --> 31:49.600
There was a man by the
name of Manuel Cabeza.

31:49.601 --> 31:54.589
Now Manuel was living with a
biracial female named Angela.

31:54.590 --> 31:59.384
Who... the KKK in Key West
was not very happy about it.

31:59.385 --> 32:02.683
Okay, now William Decker was
actually the head of...

32:02.684 --> 32:07.064
The Ku Klux Klan here in the Key West.

32:08.122 --> 32:12.807
It's almost like they were gangs
or affiliated in some way.

32:12.808 --> 32:15.218
And they're all the same race.

32:15.219 --> 32:19.401
I feel like they were dressed the same.

32:19.402 --> 32:25.302
The men are wearing, I don't know,
they're weird-looking hats.

32:27.451 --> 32:30.513
What they wind up doing is
getting a mob together.

32:30.514 --> 32:35.615
And they went and grabbed him out of his
apartment, brought him out into a field.

32:35.616 --> 32:39.635
They actually put hot tar on the
guy and they feathered him.

32:39.636 --> 32:42.636
And he was tortured.

32:43.516 --> 32:46.396
And he was burned.

32:46.943 --> 32:51.733
Manuel has a gun and decides to
go out and get some revenge.

32:51.734 --> 32:54.599
He's in the shadows. He's waiting.
He's watching.

32:54.600 --> 32:59.588
It doesn't really matter
what the consequences are.

32:59.589 --> 33:03.129
He is plotting and planning.

33:03.694 --> 33:06.955
He goes out and right here on Duval Street.

33:06.956 --> 33:10.108
He sees Decker, and he believed
Decker was responsible

33:10.109 --> 33:12.743
or he was even at the location
when they originally,

33:12.744 --> 33:16.684
snatched him up and tried to kill him.

33:16.685 --> 33:21.077
Manuel run up on his car. Now back in those
days, the cars had those running boards.

33:21.078 --> 33:22.877
He jumps up on a running board.

33:22.878 --> 33:25.415
He pumps a bullet into his
chest and one to his head.

33:25.416 --> 33:28.416
Manuel killed Decker.

33:29.653 --> 33:34.432
Manuel takes off. Where
does he take off to?

33:34.433 --> 33:40.133
To this place, which was a
building which was right here.

33:43.217 --> 33:44.700
Cops show up.

33:44.701 --> 33:47.991
Finally at some point,
Manuel decides to give up.

33:47.992 --> 33:50.439
And he was taken to the jail.

33:50.440 --> 33:54.114
Short time later, a mob forms.
They want him out.

33:54.115 --> 33:57.946
So the KKK wind up getting
into the jail cell somehow.

33:57.947 --> 34:01.340
In the middle of the night.

34:01.341 --> 34:04.041
He was sleeping.

34:05.781 --> 34:08.723
They put a bag on his head.

34:08.724 --> 34:13.619
Then they drag him to another location,
and they lynch him from a telephone pole.

34:13.620 --> 34:18.054
They have ropes, like,
with the throat and...

34:18.056 --> 34:20.034
Like not being able to breathe.

34:20.036 --> 34:22.737
And then he's shot by
everybody at the scene.

34:22.737 --> 34:24.773
They kill Manuel.

34:24.774 --> 34:27.367
The torture ended in killing him.

34:27.368 --> 34:29.628
So he's dead.

34:29.629 --> 34:32.579
Everybody that participated
in his lynching shot him,

34:32.580 --> 34:35.761
and the reason for that is that they
all participated in the murder,

34:35.762 --> 34:38.652
so everybody's involved.

34:38.652 --> 34:43.706
There was a lot of them, lots and
lots and lots and lots of them.

34:43.708 --> 34:49.516
Like, even the ones that did it, there
was way more people even behind them.

34:49.518 --> 34:52.614
There's more history about Mr. Decker.

34:52.614 --> 34:56.335
William Decker built this home.

34:56.882 --> 34:59.518
How do you feel about the fact that
the guy that build your house,

34:59.519 --> 35:01.862
was the head of the KKK in Key West?

35:01.863 --> 35:03.011
Horrible.

35:03.012 --> 35:08.912
I don't like the idea that the KKK had
a part of the history in this house.

35:11.353 --> 35:14.787
Now what I try to do when I
work with Amy is I try to bring

35:14.788 --> 35:17.089
in a sketch artist for her,
which I did in this case.

35:17.090 --> 35:21.167
And she'll usually sketch out who she sees.

35:21.168 --> 35:25.600
There was kind of, like,
a white day outfit.

35:25.601 --> 35:28.283
A white button-down linen shirt.

35:28.284 --> 35:30.373
And a pair of...

35:30.374 --> 35:33.194
White linen pants.

35:33.565 --> 35:37.105
So I have that sketch here.

35:56.703 --> 36:00.173
Now what I try to do when I
work with Amy is I try to bring

36:00.174 --> 36:03.328
in a sketch artist for her.

36:03.329 --> 36:09.229
Uh, this is the sketch of the person
that Amy saw during her walk.

36:10.276 --> 36:13.576
He look familiar at all?

36:14.271 --> 36:19.131
That's him. That's the
gentleman that I saw.

36:21.541 --> 36:23.461
Okay.

36:23.895 --> 36:28.995
Now I'm gonna show you a
picture of Mr. Decker.

36:31.636 --> 36:37.336
That is the gentleman in the
hallway walking up and down.

36:39.500 --> 36:42.680
Amy, did you see this?

36:43.571 --> 36:45.851
Wow. Okay.

36:47.343 --> 36:53.163
This, to me, definitely looks
like the person I encountered.

36:56.035 --> 36:58.247
So both men are part of this house?

36:58.248 --> 37:01.744
They're all in and around within
an immediate area of this house.

37:01.745 --> 37:04.400
It's very close. Everything's
within proximity.

37:04.401 --> 37:09.412
Conscious entities can sense my
presence just like I can sense theirs.

37:09.413 --> 37:14.023
And they will approach me if they
want me to tell their story.

37:14.024 --> 37:17.563
The burned man did not want
to come into this house.

37:17.564 --> 37:20.084
And I understand why now.

37:20.085 --> 37:23.786
But he does want his story told.

37:23.787 --> 37:26.628
Amy, why do these people
still stay in this house?

37:26.629 --> 37:30.155
What's going on with these two
individuals is that they're both,

37:30.156 --> 37:34.776
kind of in denial about the parts
that they played in what happened.

37:34.777 --> 37:38.498
So one is, you know, the eternal victim.

37:38.499 --> 37:40.995
And the other one, he
thinks he was completely

37:40.996 --> 37:43.269
right in anything and everything he did.

37:43.270 --> 37:46.340
They're in denial, and I think
that that's hindering them

37:46.341 --> 37:50.644
from being able to take the next step.

37:50.645 --> 37:52.969
- What happened to the girl?
- We don't know.

37:52.970 --> 37:57.597
Manuel did have a relationship and
did live with this woman Angela.

37:57.598 --> 38:01.918
Apparently, Angela was practicing voodoo.

38:01.927 --> 38:07.094
At one point, there was a
discussion about raising the dead.

38:07.095 --> 38:12.135
The dark-haired lady,
she's not happy about it.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.773
Very strange things.

38:18.614 --> 38:20.834
She is...

38:21.356 --> 38:24.536
Like, raising the dead.

38:25.546 --> 38:29.983
She decided to put a curse on her
lover's assailants that night.

38:29.984 --> 38:35.384
Four of the men died a very
weird and violent death.

38:39.594 --> 38:42.594
I saw, like, graves.

38:44.653 --> 38:47.167
Does the curse go against them?

38:47.168 --> 38:49.002
Circumstances are a little odd.

38:49.003 --> 38:52.468
I mean, everybody involved
in this whole mess is dead.

38:52.469 --> 38:55.695
And not by natural causes.

38:55.696 --> 38:58.344
So that violence or just the way they died,

38:58.345 --> 39:03.018
does that energy hang in
this house or this area?

39:03.019 --> 39:04.972
I think you're asking
Amy if your safe here?

39:04.973 --> 39:09.672
You know, as long as you do things
that are not going to attract,

39:09.673 --> 39:13.526
these negative beings, you're fine.

39:13.527 --> 39:15.047
Now, Glen, when we spoke,

39:15.048 --> 39:18.482
you were very intimate with me about
certain things from your past.

39:18.483 --> 39:21.000
How something really frightened you.

39:21.001 --> 39:23.569
If you can, can you explain
some of that to Amy

39:23.570 --> 39:27.774
because I think she's the
right person to tell that to.

39:27.775 --> 39:31.255
I was involved in a fight.

39:31.328 --> 39:34.015
With a negative spirit.

39:34.016 --> 39:36.072
It was a 5-year battle.

39:36.073 --> 39:41.714
And at the end of that five years,
that spirit told me, I'll be back.

39:41.715 --> 39:46.723
And if you get too cocky,
I'll be back really fast.

39:46.724 --> 39:49.259
I understand Glen's fear.

39:49.260 --> 39:54.582
When you've encountered evil and
it's attacked you, it's terrifying.

39:54.583 --> 39:57.584
The spirit world can be very dangerous.

39:57.585 --> 40:01.003
You will not be near powerful enough,

40:01.004 --> 40:04.012
to combat the fight that
you're gonna be in.

40:04.013 --> 40:05.335
Mm-hmm.

40:05.336 --> 40:06.776
Colette, let me ask you a question.

40:06.777 --> 40:09.464
Listening to everything they're
saying, how do you feel about it?

40:09.465 --> 40:11.649
Did you know about this
stuff, about his battles?

40:11.650 --> 40:15.600
I mean, how do you feel about that? Maybe
he brought something into the house.

40:15.601 --> 40:18.622
I do kind of wonder now.

40:18.623 --> 40:20.162
That's where you're wrong.

40:20.163 --> 40:22.834
I don't think you would
intentionally bring bad energy.

40:22.835 --> 40:25.655
It's not a matter of
choice but the point is...

40:25.656 --> 40:29.256
There's nothing following me.

40:30.502 --> 40:34.271
I've always tried to tell
you to watch what you do.

40:34.272 --> 40:37.475
And be aware of what's going on around you.

40:37.476 --> 40:41.916
Just because I can see and feel spirits.

40:42.377 --> 40:45.084
I didn't bring anything here because

40:45.085 --> 40:48.276
- you were here months before I showed up.
- Yeah, that's true.

40:48.277 --> 40:52.137
And the coldness that you
associated with the house.

40:52.138 --> 40:54.605
- The entity greeting you at the door...
- Yes.

40:54.606 --> 40:57.793
Had nothing to do with me,
because I wasn't in this part

40:57.794 --> 41:00.803
- of the country or the world.
- That's true. That's true.

41:00.804 --> 41:03.752
You play around with...

41:03.753 --> 41:07.903
Healing and stuff like that, but see,
that may be where you opened the door,

41:07.904 --> 41:09.539
for other people to walk in.

41:09.540 --> 41:12.431
And you may not like those people
that walk through that door.

41:12.432 --> 41:15.179
What's this healing thing?

41:15.180 --> 41:16.964
I do a lot of energy work.

41:16.965 --> 41:20.833
Hands-on healing, also Reiki, and...

41:20.834 --> 41:24.954
In my work, I do work with
children with cancer.

41:24.955 --> 41:29.190
And right before they get ready
to go, I help them transition.

41:29.191 --> 41:34.866
If it's time for them to go, I
help them go to another place.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.292
As far as that practicing healing.

41:37.293 --> 41:40.164
You do have to be very, very careful.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.065
Very careful.

41:42.066 --> 41:46.301
And as long as you keep your home
protected and the doorway kind of clean,

41:46.302 --> 41:51.170
then you won't have the
negative suckers showing up.

41:51.171 --> 41:55.971
Live and let live and
let sleeping dogs lie.

41:56.108 --> 42:00.663
People need to understand that when they
attempt to communicate with the dead,

42:00.664 --> 42:03.987
they can bring very negative
things into their lives.

42:03.988 --> 42:06.549
Things that can physically harm you.

42:06.550 --> 42:09.901
Sometimes, you can know just
enough to hurt yourself.
