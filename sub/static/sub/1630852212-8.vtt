WEBVTT

00:05.040 --> 00:07.120
That's the way life is,

00:07.139 --> 00:10.220
full of delights and emotion.

00:11.109 --> 00:14.220
A forest, a river,

00:15.130 --> 00:18.109
rain, wind and sun.

00:18.129 --> 00:21.230
It's a dove in flight.

00:22.140 --> 00:25.089
The song of a...

00:27.170 --> 00:29.230
A flower that blooms...

00:30.010 --> 00:31.089
All together.

00:31.109 --> 00:37.200
...in the middle of your heart.

00:37.219 --> 00:39.070
Thank you.

01:57.219 --> 02:00.180
I'm off to bed.
Good night.

02:01.060 --> 02:03.109
-Hey.
-What?

02:06.060 --> 02:07.099
Forget it.

02:37.159 --> 02:42.099
PERFECT LIFE

02:42.120 --> 02:45.229
WHEN YOU LET YOURSELF GO

03:23.090 --> 03:24.180
How are you doing?

03:25.120 --> 03:27.030
Are you putting on the outfit?

03:27.050 --> 03:28.150
Yes, madam!

03:28.170 --> 03:31.090
Hurry, then.
We don't have much time.

03:31.110 --> 03:33.199
Come here when you're done,
I want to see you.

03:34.069 --> 03:35.180
Ta-daa!

03:36.110 --> 03:39.099
No, sweetie.
That's the school fancy dress
outfit.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.099
-I'm wearing it to the wedding.
-No, honey.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.099
That's not the dress.
Put it on, please.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.159
-No.
-Please, Paula.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.120
-Daddy!
-Paula.

03:46.139 --> 03:48.150
Daddy, Daddy!

03:48.170 --> 03:50.199
I can wear it to María's
wedding, right?

03:51.069 --> 03:52.189
I don't know.
Whatever Mum says.

03:52.210 --> 03:55.099
I want to go as a carrot!

03:55.120 --> 03:57.099
-Come on, Pauli.
-No!

03:57.120 --> 03:58.129
You're not dressed.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.159
Martina's sick.
I'll stay with her.

04:00.180 --> 04:03.060
She's sick? Let's see,
sweetheart.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.090
How are you, honey?

04:05.189 --> 04:06.219
She's fine.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.110
She has a runny nose.

04:09.030 --> 04:11.180
Will you come to my show
this afternoon?

04:11.199 --> 04:15.139
Of course.
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

04:15.159 --> 04:16.209
Great!

04:17.199 --> 04:19.029
Fetch your jacket.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.019
-I don't want to.
-Please do it.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.040
We'll have to talk
at some point, won't we?

04:29.180 --> 04:31.110
I'm not in the mood now.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.019
¡Mummy!

04:33.040 --> 04:34.139
Can you help me?

04:35.159 --> 04:37.050
Mummy!

04:43.120 --> 04:45.159
-Is it very far?
-No, fifteen minutes away.

04:45.180 --> 04:47.209
You're going to get married
like that?

04:47.230 --> 04:48.199
Yes, Dad.

04:48.220 --> 04:50.110
Let her get married
however she wants.

04:50.129 --> 04:53.209
-I don't think it's appropriate.
-Nothing else fit me.

04:53.230 --> 04:55.050
You look gorgeous.

04:55.069 --> 04:56.110
Is it at the town hall?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.129
Bad luck about the taxi strike,
too.

04:58.149 --> 05:00.220
Coincided just with her wedding
day.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.089
That was the date they gave us.
We couldn't choose.

05:04.110 --> 05:05.209
They weren't to know.

05:05.230 --> 05:07.000
True enough.

05:07.019 --> 05:10.089
Will the buffet be sitting down
or standing up?

05:10.110 --> 05:13.009
-If it's standing up...
-It's standing up.

05:13.029 --> 05:15.089
-Standing up?
-Standing up all the time.

05:15.110 --> 05:17.110
It's penance,
your bunions will burst.

05:17.129 --> 05:19.199
Just calm down a bit.
Stop complaining!

05:19.220 --> 05:22.220
It's my sister's wedding.
It's meant to be a relaxed day.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.019
Oh!

05:24.040 --> 05:28.170
-Oops, sorry.
-Jesus, María! That is
disgusting!

05:28.189 --> 05:29.220
I have cramps.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.110
-Maybe contractions.
-You're rotten inside.

05:36.079 --> 05:38.209
You're nervous so you have wind.

05:38.230 --> 05:41.170
I think I'll go too,
otherwise it's a pain.

05:48.189 --> 05:50.069
I had a lover once.

05:51.110 --> 05:52.120
What?

05:53.209 --> 05:56.180
Your dad went to a conference
or something.

05:56.199 --> 06:00.149
I left your sister with the
neighbour
and went off with Pere.

06:00.170 --> 06:03.089
And I made love. Three times.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.029
And what three times...

06:06.050 --> 06:08.009
But then I went to say
confession.

06:08.029 --> 06:09.089
Imagine that,

06:09.110 --> 06:12.139
I confess to a priest,
he forgives me in the name of
God.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.180
Whatever.

06:15.050 --> 06:17.000
Why are you telling me this now?

06:17.160 --> 06:18.199
I don't know, dear.

06:18.220 --> 06:21.199
-And does Dad know?
-He doesn't need to.

06:21.220 --> 06:23.079
What happened?

06:23.100 --> 06:26.000
-Did you see him again?
-No, only the once.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.029
Don't take it badly, love.

06:30.050 --> 06:33.000
But I wasn't happy with your
dad.

06:33.139 --> 06:35.040
He's a good person, mind you.

06:35.060 --> 06:37.120
But I got married young...

06:37.139 --> 06:39.170
I didn't have many options.

06:40.139 --> 06:41.220
Why didn't you separate?

06:46.019 --> 06:47.230
Because of you two, I guess.

06:50.069 --> 06:52.149
But it doesn't matter.
I gradually adapted

06:52.170 --> 06:54.009
and got over it.

06:54.029 --> 06:56.029
And now look, super happy.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.189
Are you happy with Gustavo?

07:07.129 --> 07:09.079
You don't want to marry, do you?

07:09.100 --> 07:12.069
Yes I do, Mum.
Otherwise I wouldn't do it.

07:12.220 --> 07:16.060
So, by virtue of the authority
vested in me,

07:16.079 --> 07:20.069
and having freely consented
to enter into marriage,

07:20.089 --> 07:24.000
and not knowing of any
impediment
why you may not be wed,

07:24.019 --> 07:26.180
I declare you "joined in
marriage."

07:30.000 --> 07:31.079
Bravo!

07:55.079 --> 07:56.159
Little Esther!

07:56.180 --> 07:59.069
Why are you scratching yourself?

07:59.090 --> 08:01.009
I've got a sort of eczema.

08:01.089 --> 08:04.110
Oh, that's from stress.
I get bald patches this big.

08:04.209 --> 08:06.170
Alopecia areata.

08:06.189 --> 08:08.170
I'd have therapy, but no time.

08:09.019 --> 08:11.019
I don't fancy therapy.

08:11.139 --> 08:13.029
I wouldn't say no.

08:14.110 --> 08:16.129
-Darling.
-Hi, sweetheart.

08:16.149 --> 08:18.069
Do you know Gustavo's parents?

08:18.089 --> 08:20.149
Yes, we were introduced before.

08:20.170 --> 08:25.019
Turns out he has a cousin
who's going to open up a disco.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.149
And so they have a lot
of huge spaces.

08:27.170 --> 08:29.189
We thought you could exhibit
there.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.199
Sure.

08:30.220 --> 08:34.220
That way you sell a painting
and make a bit of money.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.120
-I need the loo.
-Huh? Where?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.169
-That's how artists are.
-They have character.

08:41.190 --> 08:43.149
-Are you enjoying yourself?
-Yeah.

08:43.169 --> 08:46.080
Congratulations, cousins.

08:46.100 --> 08:49.149
So, when is my second cousin
due?

08:49.169 --> 08:52.230
-No...
-He's not the father.

08:53.059 --> 08:54.169
Gari is.

08:54.190 --> 08:57.009
Gari, Víctor. A cousin of...

08:58.059 --> 08:59.210
Your attention, please.

08:59.230 --> 09:03.159
Let the couple come forward,
my nephew and niece by marriage.

09:03.179 --> 09:05.179
I have a gift for you.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.039
There was no need for this.

09:08.059 --> 09:11.009
-But we said no gifts.
-No.

09:11.029 --> 09:12.090
That's so much money!

09:12.110 --> 09:15.000
A thousand euros each
for when you have the baby,

09:15.019 --> 09:16.179
buy whatever you want.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.110
-Didn't you tell them?
-Not yet.

09:34.129 --> 09:36.009
Well you should have.

09:36.029 --> 09:38.080
Time for the cake, right?

09:38.100 --> 09:39.139
Come on.

09:40.139 --> 09:42.210
The plan was for my parents
to tell everyone.

09:42.230 --> 09:44.190
It wasn't my fault if they
didn't.

09:44.210 --> 09:46.070
So call and tell them.

09:46.090 --> 09:48.190
Sure, it's really normal
to phone everyone

09:48.210 --> 09:50.049
and say, "Did you know?

09:50.070 --> 09:53.009
María got pregnant
by a disabled guy.

09:53.029 --> 09:56.009
-Because the day we broke up..."
-The day you left me.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.039
With no warning
and in front of people.

09:58.059 --> 10:01.129
So you screwed a stranger
to get back at me?

10:05.029 --> 10:06.100
Sorry.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.009
Jesus, I'm sorry.

10:17.019 --> 10:19.090
Go and tell him
you won't steal his place.

10:21.179 --> 10:25.070
-I'm going to park. I'll be
right back.
-Fourth floor, flat two.

10:34.019 --> 10:35.110
Who is it?

10:35.129 --> 10:36.230
María, can you buzz me in?

10:37.009 --> 10:39.200
Gari gave me orders
not to let you come up.

10:45.059 --> 10:46.080
Hi.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.090
Hi.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.159
Gari called you, didn't he?

10:50.049 --> 10:52.029
-You know the story?
-Yes.

10:52.049 --> 10:54.019
They won't let me in.

10:58.129 --> 11:00.120
-Listen...
-You're not coming up.

11:00.139 --> 11:03.169
Richi, it's Xosé. Open up.

11:03.190 --> 11:05.059
Are you with María?

11:05.080 --> 11:07.169
Come on, please open the door.
We can talk.

11:07.190 --> 11:11.100
I'll ask.
This situation wasn't planned
for.

11:14.129 --> 11:15.210
Gustavo is parking.

11:18.230 --> 11:20.159
He doesn't know you and I...

11:22.179 --> 11:24.070
I guessed as much.

11:25.139 --> 11:27.179
Well, I could have told him.

11:28.009 --> 11:30.039
-But you didn't.
-No.

11:33.179 --> 11:36.139
Yes, the wedding dress didn't
fit.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.100
You got married like that?

11:38.120 --> 11:40.100
-Yeah.
-Seriously?

11:41.029 --> 11:42.059
Don't you like it?

11:43.139 --> 11:46.039
I'm pregnant
and my belly is getting bigger.

11:50.190 --> 11:52.009
Congratulations.

12:04.220 --> 12:06.090
No, no!

12:13.159 --> 12:16.179
Everyone knows you're the dad,
no one can take that away.

12:16.200 --> 12:20.110
Besides, the room you all
decorated
is lovely. It'll be the baby's
room.

12:20.129 --> 12:21.139
No!

12:21.159 --> 12:24.059
What have we talked about
many times?

12:24.080 --> 12:26.120
It shouldn't matter
what anyone thinks.

12:26.139 --> 12:28.190
-Leave me alone!
-Come on, Gari.

12:28.210 --> 12:31.129
I'm sick of this!
I won't treat you like a kid!

12:31.149 --> 12:33.210
You're 32!
Behave like an adult!

12:33.230 --> 12:36.049
You're going to be a dad!
Deal with it!

12:36.070 --> 12:38.080
I'm scared too and I suck it up!

12:40.019 --> 12:41.129
Damn, I've peed myself!

12:41.149 --> 12:43.019
-Is that wee?
-Yes, it is.

12:43.039 --> 12:45.009
I'm eight months pregnant
and I wet myself.

12:45.029 --> 12:47.070
-Sure it's wee?
-Yes.

12:49.179 --> 12:52.100
Okay. Maybe it isn't wee.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.000
Then what is it?

12:54.019 --> 12:57.019
-Should we call A&E?
-It's transparent, right?

12:57.149 --> 12:58.169
Yes.

12:58.190 --> 13:00.049
Yes, yes.

13:00.149 --> 13:01.169
My water just broke.

13:01.190 --> 13:03.100
-Crap!
-We're in labour.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.049
-I'll get that.
-We're not in labour,

13:05.070 --> 13:07.000
because I'm due in three weeks.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.200
-We need to tell Maruja.
-Maruja.

13:08.220 --> 13:11.139
-Anyone know a Gustavo?
-Yes, of course. Let him in.

13:11.159 --> 13:13.120
-Richi, buzz him in!
-Okay, okay.

13:13.139 --> 13:16.000
-Gari, call Maruja.
-Okay.

13:16.019 --> 13:18.090
Hey, look at me.
Call Maruja, it'll be okay.

13:18.110 --> 13:20.230
-We'll call her.
-Everything is fine.

13:21.070 --> 13:23.210
You won't believe
what happened to me.

13:25.039 --> 13:26.210
I'll be giving birth in a bath.

13:26.230 --> 13:28.139
No, we'll grab a taxi.

13:28.159 --> 13:30.200
There's a strike.
There are no taxis.

13:30.220 --> 13:33.179
-Hang on, what was the hospital?
-The Vall d'Hebron.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.159
How to reach the Vall d'Hebron
by bus.

13:36.179 --> 13:39.120
-I'm not giving birth on a bus.
-Sit and breathe.

13:39.139 --> 13:42.090
I'll slap the next one
who tells me to breathe.

13:42.110 --> 13:45.149
Okay, Maruja says breathe.

13:46.009 --> 13:49.210
You take a shower, then we go
to the hospital without any
hassle.

13:49.230 --> 13:52.110
I'm three weeks early,
but everything is fine.

13:52.129 --> 13:55.009
No sweat,
I'll shower and put on a
facemask.

13:55.029 --> 13:56.210
She didn't mention facemasks.

13:56.230 --> 14:00.100
But she did say
you could have an enema.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.039
-An enema?
-Yeah, an enema.

14:02.059 --> 14:04.190
-I'm not having an enema.
-But guys.

14:05.059 --> 14:06.220
How will you get there?

14:13.230 --> 14:15.210
OFFER:
BUY TICKET

14:15.230 --> 14:18.029
DESTINATION: INDIA
ONE WAY ONLY

14:23.159 --> 14:25.100
God, she's a pain.

14:29.019 --> 14:30.120
What?

14:30.139 --> 14:31.169
Already?

14:32.110 --> 14:33.159
Bloody hell!

14:33.179 --> 14:36.139
I'm on my way. I'll be a while,
okay?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.179
Jesus, Jesus.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.019
I'm not squeezing...

14:42.230 --> 14:44.000
There she is.

14:45.039 --> 14:46.080
I'm having a baby.

14:46.159 --> 14:48.080
I'm having a baby.

14:48.100 --> 14:51.029
Bye, guys!
Good luck. Good luck!

14:52.210 --> 14:53.190
How are you?

14:53.210 --> 14:54.230
I'm having a baby.

14:58.190 --> 15:01.169
-Juanito, please hold on.
-His name is not Juanito!

15:01.190 --> 15:04.139
-Do I take the Ronda de Dalt?
-Ronda de Dalt.

15:04.159 --> 15:05.210
Don't go the wrong way.

15:05.230 --> 15:07.220
Quickest route to Vall d'Hebron.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Hotels in the Ebro Valley.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.000
I have to turn.

15:12.019 --> 15:13.049
Yeah, go right.

15:13.070 --> 15:15.110
Jesus, Ronda de Dalt.
Listen to me, please.

15:15.129 --> 15:18.149
-We're here.
-Jesus, I know Barcelona.

15:19.059 --> 15:20.090
Goddamn it.

15:24.100 --> 15:27.159
Okay, off you go,
I'll look for somewhere to sit.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.090
Are you and Daddy going to split
up?

15:33.179 --> 15:35.120
No, darling, no.

15:35.139 --> 15:36.210
No.

15:37.220 --> 15:40.110
Hey, listen. I love you to bits.

15:40.230 --> 15:43.100
-Do I get a kiss?
-On the nose.

15:45.210 --> 15:48.200
Okay, carrot girl.
Show them who you are.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.070
Hi, sweetheart.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.080
Hello, my love.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.210
This is half your dish.

16:09.100 --> 16:12.179
DJ Tomato and Carrot Style.

16:14.139 --> 16:17.049
When it comes to antioxidants,
we rock.

16:17.070 --> 16:19.169
And in vitamins, we're the top.

16:19.190 --> 16:21.169
I'm going out to get some air.

16:21.190 --> 16:25.090
-What about Paula?
-Her class is last, be right
back.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.230
Half your dish must be
vegetables.

16:29.129 --> 16:32.129
Half your dish must be
vegetables.

16:33.070 --> 16:36.210
You'll have to put on this smock
if you want to be with her.

16:36.230 --> 16:39.159
-Okay.
-Come with me and I'll give you
one.

16:40.049 --> 16:42.029
Do you mind waiting here a sec?

16:42.049 --> 16:44.100
All right... okay.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.210
Don't worry, you can be together
during the birth.

16:46.230 --> 16:47.210
We'll be right back.

16:48.039 --> 16:49.190
-Ok.
-This way.

17:38.079 --> 17:40.089
Can I have a drag?

17:46.109 --> 17:48.039
Sometimes your hair smells
of cigarettes.

17:52.019 --> 17:53.000
Where's Martina?

17:54.099 --> 17:57.180
I asked Laura's mum
to stay with her a minute.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.160
I've been with four women
since we were together.

18:07.029 --> 18:09.039
Two were a one-night stand,

18:09.059 --> 18:12.059
when I was doing that course
in Madrid.

18:12.200 --> 18:16.079
Another was with a workmate.
We only did it three times.

18:17.029 --> 18:20.099
The fourth was messing around,
there was no sex.

18:20.119 --> 18:21.150
So...

18:22.099 --> 18:24.119
I guess that doesn't count.

18:35.029 --> 18:38.150
I get it, it hurts me, but...

18:39.009 --> 18:40.190
I'm sorry...

18:41.140 --> 18:43.009
So what do we do?

18:43.029 --> 18:44.079
I don't know.

18:44.200 --> 18:48.029
Look, both of us have... Right?

18:48.220 --> 18:51.059
We carried on together...

18:51.130 --> 18:53.069
and it was relatively okay.

18:59.029 --> 19:00.190
Do you want a separation?

19:06.099 --> 19:07.130
What about you?

19:09.049 --> 19:10.059
No.

19:30.099 --> 19:32.180
I'd screw you here right now.

19:46.009 --> 19:48.109
You know what?
It makes me so mad.

19:48.130 --> 19:51.230
It makes me mad that from when
we're little they brainwash us

19:52.009 --> 19:54.150
to pull out all the stops
for our dreams.

19:54.170 --> 19:59.000
Know what I mean?
If you want something, you'll
get it.

19:59.019 --> 20:02.220
"Where there's a will, there's a
way."
What a shitty saying!

20:03.000 --> 20:04.039
It's so lame, right?

20:04.059 --> 20:05.150
Really lame.

20:05.170 --> 20:08.140
Wanting something is just that.

20:09.019 --> 20:11.119
What if you want something
and can't get it?

20:11.140 --> 20:13.150
Does it mean you're a loser?

20:13.170 --> 20:18.019
Am I worthless because I didn't
sell one
bloody painting at that trendy
market?

20:18.190 --> 20:21.089
So I'm worthless
because I have no followers.

20:21.109 --> 20:23.049
What the fuck is that about?

20:24.019 --> 20:28.079
I never wanted to have
followers,
all I want is to paint, dammit.

20:29.190 --> 20:31.099
And now I don't sell or paint.

20:31.119 --> 20:33.220
At least
I used to enjoy painting before,

20:34.000 --> 20:37.150
now all this shit
has totally turned me off.

20:39.049 --> 20:41.230
All this listening to others.
I should go back to painting for
myself.

20:46.210 --> 20:48.170
Sorry for bending your ear.

20:48.190 --> 20:50.000
No worries.

20:51.019 --> 20:53.089
It really feels good to talk.

20:53.109 --> 20:57.029
How much do you charge
for a therapy session?

20:59.170 --> 21:01.150
I'm not a psychologist.

21:01.170 --> 21:03.039
-No?
-No.

21:03.059 --> 21:05.109
-And what...?
-I'm a social worker.

21:20.190 --> 21:22.079
-Hi.
-Hey, how are they?

21:23.119 --> 21:25.119
It's a premature birth.

21:25.140 --> 21:29.180
But the baby is okay
and María is dilating well.

21:29.200 --> 21:33.210
Do you want to go in
and be with María for a little
while?

21:33.230 --> 21:36.220
-No, it's better if you're with
her.
-Okay, fine.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.150
How do you feel?

21:40.180 --> 21:42.099
Take it easy, son.

21:42.119 --> 21:43.220
Take it easy.

21:45.180 --> 21:47.069
I'm a bit nervous, Dad.

21:49.009 --> 21:51.160
-All right, see you later.
-Yeah, I'll go in.

21:51.180 --> 21:53.220
-I'll keep you posted.
-Don't worry.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.009
Go for it.

21:55.220 --> 21:59.200
What a palaver to get here
with the strike.

22:00.180 --> 22:02.119
-They're fine.
-Really?

22:02.140 --> 22:05.170
She's still in labour,
but it's all under control.

22:06.210 --> 22:08.160
Of course we know each other.

22:08.180 --> 22:10.200
-How are you holding up?
-Fine.

22:14.059 --> 22:16.210
-Pleased to meet you.
-A friend.

22:17.119 --> 22:19.089
Another member of the family!

22:19.220 --> 22:21.130
Oh, Lord. I'm so nervous.

22:38.109 --> 22:40.109
-Is that it?
-Yeah.

22:40.130 --> 22:42.130
Great. Great.

22:44.009 --> 22:45.089
Hang on.

22:53.180 --> 22:54.200
Are you okay?

22:54.220 --> 22:56.150
Nurse!

22:56.170 --> 22:58.000
Nurse!

22:58.019 --> 22:59.049
Nurse!

23:04.029 --> 23:06.089
Okay, now please lower your
head.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.000
Stay like that.

23:11.039 --> 23:12.210
It's important
that you don't move.

23:13.170 --> 23:14.230
Hold on to me.

23:15.069 --> 23:16.089
Breathe.

23:16.109 --> 23:17.220
I'm with you.

23:42.119 --> 23:44.109
-Hi.
-Hi.

23:44.230 --> 23:46.180
They told me you wanted to see
me.

23:47.029 --> 23:49.049
-How are you?
-Fine.

23:49.069 --> 23:50.140
-I'm fine now.
-Yeah?

23:51.029 --> 23:52.140
Need anything?

23:54.069 --> 23:55.099
A divorce.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.029
What?

23:57.190 --> 24:01.029
Oops, sorry.
That's the epidural talking, no
filter.

24:06.059 --> 24:07.130
Are you okay?

24:08.099 --> 24:10.089
I've been thinking the same all
day.

24:11.019 --> 24:11.230
What?

24:12.009 --> 24:14.089
I was saying to myself,
"What are you doing?

24:14.109 --> 24:16.049
You've screwed up again."

24:16.069 --> 24:18.160
First, I leave you at the
notary's office.

24:18.180 --> 24:21.130
Then Gari gets you pregnant.

24:21.150 --> 24:23.099
And yet we decide to be
together.

24:23.119 --> 24:26.180
Then you suggest we get married
and I say yes.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.170
Because I love you so much.

24:29.019 --> 24:31.049
But actually...

24:31.069 --> 24:32.210
It's no more...

24:34.180 --> 24:35.170
No more.

24:37.180 --> 24:39.009
No.

24:42.039 --> 24:43.130
I love you so much.

24:43.150 --> 24:44.200
Same here.

24:50.059 --> 24:52.059
Oh, I'm so sleepy.

25:03.049 --> 25:04.119
María.

25:05.150 --> 25:06.160
María!

25:07.000 --> 25:08.039
What is it?

25:08.059 --> 25:11.000
Come on, up we get.
It's nearly time.

25:11.019 --> 25:12.039
Already?

25:12.059 --> 25:14.049
-It's time?
-Hi, how's it going?

25:14.069 --> 25:15.150
-Hi there.
-Hi, María.

25:15.170 --> 25:18.109
-Hi.
-I'm Irene, the gynaecologist
here.

25:18.130 --> 25:21.029
These resident gynaecologists
will be watching.

25:21.049 --> 25:22.170
-Is that okay?
-Yes, sure.

25:22.190 --> 25:25.019
All right.
I'll examine you like before.

25:25.039 --> 25:26.019
-Okay?
-Okay.

25:27.079 --> 25:30.029
Hey, you've dilated really well.

25:30.049 --> 25:31.130
-Have I?
-Yes.

25:31.150 --> 25:33.150
-So you won't cut my vagina?
-No.

25:33.170 --> 25:37.119
Now what you have to do
is push, okay?

25:37.180 --> 25:39.049
Push.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.160
Yes, that's great.
Great!

25:44.049 --> 25:46.210
Good, very good.
Can you help me clean her up?

25:46.230 --> 25:48.210
Sorry, sorry.

25:48.230 --> 25:50.220
-Do you feel okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.180
I don't know where to stand
so I'm not in the way.

25:53.200 --> 25:57.000
-How about next to her?
-Okay, thanks. Perfect.

25:57.019 --> 26:00.019
-Did I really do a poo?
-Don't worry, it's normal.

26:00.039 --> 26:02.059
-I was at a wedding.
-Really?

26:02.079 --> 26:05.059
-Actually, my wedding.
-You don't say!

26:05.079 --> 26:08.170
-Congratulations!
-No, I'm not...

26:08.190 --> 26:10.180
-No, he's not the groom.
-Oh, okay.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.150
-Congratulations anyway.
-Thanks.

26:14.009 --> 26:17.130
Okay. Let's start pushing again,
nice and easy.

26:17.150 --> 26:18.170
Breathe.

26:18.190 --> 26:20.170
He's coming and she's suffering,

26:20.190 --> 26:23.009
so we'll do an episiotomy to
cut...

26:23.029 --> 26:25.099
Episiotomy?
Did you just do that?

26:25.119 --> 26:27.109
-She did this.
-It's a small incision

26:27.130 --> 26:29.079
to avoid vaginal tearing.

26:29.099 --> 26:31.160
We agreed
you wouldn't cut my vagina.

26:31.180 --> 26:34.099
-No, you're doing a great job.
-Please don't cut it!

26:34.119 --> 26:35.140
Look, I have an idea.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.119
-We can delay the birth.
-No.

26:37.140 --> 26:39.079
Yes, I was due in three weeks.

26:39.099 --> 26:41.200
-Focus on pushing.
-Give me a C-section.

26:41.220 --> 26:43.170
You take him out, cut the cord.

26:43.190 --> 26:44.210
We can't do that.

26:44.230 --> 26:47.130
I can't give birth now.
I don't want to.

26:47.150 --> 26:50.009
-María.
-I'm really scared of giving
birth.

26:50.029 --> 26:51.099
María, look at me.

26:53.089 --> 26:56.069
You're about to be a mother, ok?

26:57.099 --> 27:02.079
And now you have to act
like an adult.

27:03.230 --> 27:06.019
You're doing really well.

27:06.039 --> 27:08.049
-Am I?
-You're doing awesome.

27:08.150 --> 27:11.119
-You just have to breathe.
-All right.

27:11.140 --> 27:13.049
Good, María.

27:13.069 --> 27:15.130
-Good.
-You're doing really well.

27:15.150 --> 27:16.200
Really well.

27:16.220 --> 27:19.230
A big push.
You've got this, champ.

27:20.009 --> 27:21.180
-Push.
-Great.

27:22.099 --> 27:24.119
Great. That's it.

27:24.140 --> 27:26.059
Okay, I can see the crown.

27:26.079 --> 27:28.049
-Want to see it, Gari?
-Yeah.

27:28.069 --> 27:29.210
-Come here.
-Okay.

27:30.180 --> 27:32.130
Look. See?

27:32.150 --> 27:35.000
Give me your hand.

27:35.019 --> 27:36.160
Okay. See this?

27:36.180 --> 27:38.160
-This hard thing with fuzz?
-Yes.

27:38.180 --> 27:40.099
-This is the head.
-Really?

27:41.049 --> 27:43.039
Now squeeze a bit more, all
right?

27:43.059 --> 27:44.079
That's it.

27:45.029 --> 27:46.099
You're doing great.

27:46.119 --> 27:49.049
-Squeeze, María.
-Great job, champ.

27:49.069 --> 27:50.170
Great!

27:51.150 --> 27:54.009
Now you can hold him.

27:54.079 --> 27:56.049
Hold him.

27:58.059 --> 28:00.109
Well done, María.

28:05.029 --> 28:06.200
This is your son.

28:06.220 --> 28:08.029
Hello!

28:11.019 --> 28:13.059
Why is he so blue?

28:13.079 --> 28:14.210
-It's normal.
-Oh.

28:14.230 --> 28:16.210
He's moving, breathing,
has a good colour.

28:16.230 --> 28:18.200
No need to worry.

28:27.029 --> 28:30.009
Can I give him a kiss?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.009
Of course.

28:36.099 --> 28:38.000
Gari,

28:38.019 --> 28:39.200
do you want to cut the cord?

28:39.220 --> 28:41.069
Okay.

28:41.089 --> 28:42.190
Here.

28:42.210 --> 28:45.109
-Here?
-Here. Press hard.

28:46.230 --> 28:48.170
That's it.

28:48.190 --> 28:50.190
Good job.

28:52.009 --> 28:53.130
Great, huh?

28:55.210 --> 28:57.039
Hi there.

28:58.069 --> 29:00.009
Welcome.

29:02.049 --> 29:03.220
Hiya.

29:42.029 --> 29:43.069
Juanito.

29:43.180 --> 29:45.009
I'm almost done, okay?

29:53.109 --> 29:55.019
Finished.

29:57.059 --> 29:58.049
Hiya!

29:58.069 --> 30:00.029
My nephew,
he's good enough to eat.

30:00.049 --> 30:02.150
Hang on, I'll cover him a bit.

30:02.170 --> 30:04.000
Hi, nephew.

30:04.140 --> 30:06.170
He's cold.

30:06.190 --> 30:08.130
Welcome, Juanito, sweetie.

30:08.150 --> 30:10.059
Juan, his name's Juan.

30:10.079 --> 30:13.089
But you know perfectly well
we'll call him Juanito.

30:13.109 --> 30:15.079
Right, Juanito? What a pity.

30:15.099 --> 30:17.170
-Hey, congrats.
-Thanks.

30:18.079 --> 30:20.019
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

30:20.039 --> 30:21.180
Hey, I'm the one who gave birth.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.210
-I could eat you!
-I'm going for coffee. Any
takers?

30:24.230 --> 30:27.099
-Not me, Dad. Thanks.
-No, thanks.

30:29.140 --> 30:31.019
Don't touch.

30:31.039 --> 30:32.200
I feel like I shat a melon.

30:32.220 --> 30:35.089
How many stitches
did they give you?

30:35.109 --> 30:36.150
In my vagina?

30:36.170 --> 30:38.000
Six.

30:38.019 --> 30:40.200
-Crap!
-Yeah, and my arse feels...

30:40.220 --> 30:44.140
Okay, forget it. To make up for
it,
we have a surprise for you.

30:44.160 --> 30:48.069
-As we can't go to the beach...
-The beach has come to you.

30:48.089 --> 30:49.230
I wanted to bring a parasol,

30:50.009 --> 30:51.049
but this fart wouldn't let me.

30:51.069 --> 30:54.109
-A Tupperware with watermelon.
-Yes, sweetie.

30:56.009 --> 30:57.029
It's so cool.

30:57.049 --> 30:58.049
Thanks.

30:58.069 --> 31:00.150
-I love you guys.
-And we love you.

31:00.170 --> 31:02.049
Oh, great. It's sushi.

31:02.069 --> 31:03.210
Gari, there's some for you.

31:03.230 --> 31:06.079
I don't like raw fish.
Thanks a lot.

31:06.099 --> 31:08.119
-No, but we have chicken.
-Oh, okay.

31:08.140 --> 31:10.200
Here, hold him.
Be really careful.

31:10.220 --> 31:12.140
His head...

31:13.170 --> 31:15.069
Hi, little one.

31:15.089 --> 31:17.069
Oh, Auntie Esther!

31:17.089 --> 31:20.019
- I'm Auntie Esther!
- Can I sit down?

31:20.039 --> 31:22.039
I'm Auntie Esther!

31:23.009 --> 31:26.230
What's the plan now? You can
stay
at my place as long as you want.

31:27.009 --> 31:28.109
You can all come home.

31:28.130 --> 31:30.029
We'll play it by ear.

31:30.160 --> 31:33.039
-Yeah.
-We don't have a plan.

31:33.059 --> 31:35.119
My flat has several rooms.

31:35.140 --> 31:37.160
And I thought...

31:37.180 --> 31:40.109
that maybe the three of you
could move in.

31:40.130 --> 31:43.009
-Wow.
-That's not a bad idea.

31:43.029 --> 31:44.130
Well, I'm not so sure.

31:44.150 --> 31:46.180
-I already have a house.
-I'm a bit tired of the loft.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.230
I'll live there, then.
You go with Gari.

31:49.009 --> 31:51.220
But if you think about it,
it's not such a bad idea.

31:52.039 --> 31:55.190
All living together and rearing
the kids
like in a hippy family.

31:55.210 --> 31:58.109
-Maybe it would do me good...
-With Pablo...

31:58.130 --> 32:02.029
Anyone could drop in.
You can invite whoever you want.

32:02.049 --> 32:03.089
Because you're cute.

32:03.109 --> 32:04.140
Want some wasabi?

32:04.160 --> 32:07.140
No, I have a haemorrhoid
the size of a peach.

32:09.130 --> 32:10.230
This big, a GMO one.

32:11.009 --> 32:13.089
-Don't be so graphic.
-Isn't he a bit ugly?
