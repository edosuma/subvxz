WEBVTT

00:03.753 --> 00:06.672
I don't see why we have to do this
every year.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.590
I thought that last year,
the teachers agreed

00:08.758 --> 00:10.968
that they wouldn't do this anymore.

00:11.136 --> 00:14.972
Captain Picard Day is one of
the children's favorite school activities.

00:15.140 --> 00:18.142
They look forward to it all year.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.978
Why does it have to be me?

00:21.146 --> 00:23.981
Because you're the captain
and they look up to you.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.150
You're a role model for them.

00:26.317 --> 00:30.946
Well, they seem to have a somewhat
exaggerated impression of me.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.615
[IMlTATING PICARD  I think
the resemblance is rather striking.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.159
Wouldn't you agree, Number One?

00:37.787 --> 00:39.413
Isn't there something else
you have to do?

00:39.581 --> 00:41.665
I'll be on the Bridge.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.085
Will.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.513
The finalists will be here
in half an hour.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.849
You have to pick a first, second
and third place,

00:59.017 --> 01:01.226
and four honorable mentions.

It is coded priority one.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.277
Put it through, Mr. Worf.
Excuse me, counselor.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.077
Yes, admiral?

01:18.244 --> 01:20.704
Captain, what is your status?

01:21.372 --> 01:23.248
We are conducting
energy-output studies

01:23.416 --> 01:25.167
of the Mekoria quasar.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.544
All systems normal.
The ship is fully operational.

01:27.712 --> 01:32.049
Good. l'm postponing
the quasar study for the moment.

01:32.217 --> 01:35.677
The Enterprise is to rendezvous
with the starship Crazy Horse

01:35.845 --> 01:40.015
in Sector 1 607, immediately.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.851
You're authorized to exceed
warp-speed limitations

01:43.019 --> 01:45.312
for the duration of this assignment.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.940
I understand.
What is our assignment?

01:48.108 --> 01:51.568
I'd prefer not to discuss it
over subspace channels.

01:51.736 --> 01:55.322
The Crazy Horse will be carrying
someone from Starfleet lntelligence.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.616
He'll brief you when he arrives.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.076
Very well.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.829
"Captain Picard Day"?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.540
Oh, uh...

02:04.707 --> 02:07.543
Yes, it's, uh, for the children.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.711

I'm sure you are. Starfleet out.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.145
[IN NORMAL VOICE
So who won the contest?

02:26.312 --> 02:29.439
Oh, Paul Menegay, a 7-year-old.

02:29.607 --> 02:31.900
He did a most interesting
clay sculpture of my head.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.987
Was that the orange one?
With the lumpy skin?

02:35.155 --> 02:36.446
- Yes.
- Mm-hm.

02:36.614 --> 02:37.865
Oh, you'll be interested to know

02:38.032 --> 02:40.367
that I've arranged for
a Commander Riker Day next month.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.120
I'm even considering
making an entry myself.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.788
Great.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.040
- Energize.
CHIEF: Aye, sir.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.463
Will.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.842
I'll bet you never thought
you'd see me again.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.052
It's good to see you, sir.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.097
Yeah, sure it is.
You look like you're about to faint.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.475
No, it's just that
it's been a long time.

03:05.643 --> 03:09.855
Captain Jean-Luc Picard,
Admiral Eric Pressman.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.190
Pressman, yes, of course.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.317
You were Will's
first commanding officer,

03:13.484 --> 03:15.402
on the Pegasus.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.778
That's right.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.823
As a matter of fact,
the Pegasus is the reason I'm here.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.366
Sir?

03:21.534 --> 03:26.205
She's still out there, Will,
and the Romulans have found her.

03:56.152 --> 04:00.364
PICARD:
Space, the final frontier.

04:00.907 --> 04:04.952
These are the voyages
ofthe starship Enterprise.

04:05.119 --> 04:10.374
Its continuing mission:
to explore strange new worlds,

04:10.541 --> 04:14.586
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

04:15.129 --> 04:19.591
to boldly go where no one
has gone before.

05:23.781 --> 05:26.366
As you know, the starship Pegasus
was lost in this sector

05:26.534 --> 05:29.328
some 12 years ago,
along with most of her crew.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.537
I was her captain,

05:30.705 --> 05:32.289
and Commander Riker here
was my helmsman.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.582
I remember hearing about it.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.960
The ship was destroyed
by a warp-core breach, as I recall.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.628
Captain and I,
along with seven others,

05:38.796 --> 05:42.299
managed to make it to the escape pod
before the breach became critical.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.134
From space,
we observed what appeared to be

05:44.302 --> 05:47.637
a matter-antimatter explosion
which vaporized the ship.

05:47.805 --> 05:53.143
No wreckage was found, so Starfleet
officially declared the ship destroyed.

05:53.311 --> 05:56.438
However, all that
changed three days ago.

05:56.606 --> 06:00.192
Starfleet lntelligence has an operative
in Romulan High Command.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.319
He sent us a message
that a Romulan warbird

06:02.487 --> 06:05.906
had located a piece of debris
in the Devolin system

06:06.074 --> 06:09.368
which was positively identified
as being from the Pegasus.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.079
The warbird was then ordered
to locate the rest of the ship,

06:12.246 --> 06:13.872
if possible, and retrieve it.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.666
What would the Romulans want
with pieces of a 12-year-old starship?

06:16.834 --> 06:18.377
The Pegasus was a prototype.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.712
Experimental engine,
new weapons systems.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.005
In fact, some of our designs

06:22.173 --> 06:24.508
were used
in constructing the Enterprise.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.093
There are things onboard
the Romulans

06:26.260 --> 06:28.345
would love to get their hands on.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.554
What are our orders?

06:29.722 --> 06:31.765
PRESSMAN: To find the ship
before the Romulans do.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.351
Salvage it if possible,
destroy it if necessary.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.353
You command the Enterprise.
I remain in command

06:36.521 --> 06:37.646
of the overall mission.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.315
We need the metallurgical and
chronographic specs on the Pegasus

06:40.483 --> 06:42.526
in order to set up
the proper search parameters.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.861
I'll make the appropriate information
available to you.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.321
Very well.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.407

for the Devolin system.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.991
Aye, sir.

06:58.876 --> 07:02.003
Captain, we are approaching
the Devolin system.

07:02.171 --> 07:04.548
- Any sign of the Romulans?
DATA: No, sir.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.049
Well, they're out there.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.218
They're just waiting to see
what you're going to do.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.428
Mr. La Forge?

07:09.595 --> 07:12.222
There's an awful lot of ionizing
radiation in this system, captain.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.933
That and the amount of sheer rock
is gonna slow down our search.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.309
- How slow?
- I'd say at least--

I've heard so much about you.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.428
A pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.431
I hope our sudden appearance
didn't startle you.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.683
Heh. Not at all,

07:56.851 --> 08:01.938
but your unannounced appearance
might have unfortunate consequences.

08:02.106 --> 08:03.732
It would be an awful shame

08:03.900 --> 08:07.694
if your ship were damaged
due to some misunderstanding.

08:07.862 --> 08:11.114
I am touched
by your concern for my ship,

08:11.282 --> 08:14.784
but l doubt
we were ever in any danger.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.621
May l ask
what you are doing in this system?

08:18.289 --> 08:20.290
I might ask you the same question.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.460
We are conducting a survey
of gaseous anomalies.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.339
How interesting. So are we.

08:27.507 --> 08:31.301
Perhaps we could combine our efforts
and share our findings.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.554
I doubt our objectives
are compatible.

08:35.473 --> 08:36.806
Perhaps you're right.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.643
This has been
a most pleasant conversation,

08:39.810 --> 08:41.978
but we must return to our research.

08:42.813 --> 08:43.980

08:58.329 --> 09:00.830
Commander, how long will it take us
to search this system?

09:00.998 --> 09:02.541
At least seven days, sir.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.252

have a two-day head start.

Initiating sensor sweep of Grid 01 .

09:12.343 --> 09:14.135
So how long
have you had that beard?

09:14.303 --> 09:16.221
About four years.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.057

how young I looked.

09:19.225 --> 09:24.187
What was it that, uh,
Lieutenant Boylen used to call you?

09:24.355 --> 09:25.730

of a sense of humor.

I like to think that l've lightened up
a little in my old age.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.781
Really?

09:34.949 --> 09:36.700
I've been known to tell a joke or two.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.034
Well, it's about time.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.828
You were always so serious
on the Pegasus.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.371
Yeah.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.668
We went through
some serious times.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.131
Do you think we're gonna find
the Pegasus again?

09:51.299 --> 09:53.883
I wouldn't have come
all the way out here if I didn't.

09:55.219 --> 09:58.638
What about the experiment? Do you
think we're going to find that too?

09:58.806 --> 09:59.931
Maybe.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.731
You know, I think a lot
about what happened.

10:08.232 --> 10:09.733
Especially on that last day.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.360
So do I.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.362
It's not the kind of thing
you just forget.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.698
Do you ever wonder
if we did the right thing?

10:17.783 --> 10:19.409
Never.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.453
What happened was a tragedy, yes,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.330
but it wasn't your fault
and it wasn't mine.

10:23.497 --> 10:25.749
What we were doing
was for the good of the Federation,

10:25.916 --> 10:29.127
and we can't blame ourselves
if the others couldn't see that.

10:29.295 --> 10:33.381
I know, but maybe we went about it
the wrong way.

10:35.259 --> 10:39.387
Well, this time, we may have a chance
to do it the right way.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.306
If this mission is successful,

10:41.474 --> 10:43.975
if we find the Pegasus
and the experiment,

10:44.143 --> 10:46.936
we can finish
what we started 1 2 years ago.

10:49.398 --> 10:50.899
You wanna try again?

10:51.067 --> 10:54.778
It's not just me, Will.
The chief of Starfleet security

10:54.945 --> 10:57.947
has personally given me
her assurance of complete support.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.699
Admiral Raner?

10:59.867 --> 11:01.368
How many other people
know about this?

11:01.535 --> 11:04.913
Not many, and it's up to us
to make sure it stays that way.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.831
Raner has given me
written orders for you.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.501
You'll find them coded
in the Enterprise computer.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.379
You've been instructed not to reveal
the true nature of our mission

11:12.546 --> 11:15.632
to anyone else.
Not even Captain Picard.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.053
Will, don't worry.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.056
It won't be like it was 12 years ago.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.309
And this time,
no one's gonna stop us.

11:40.658 --> 11:41.908
As a matter of fact,

11:42.076 --> 11:44.244
I never met Will
until he reported onboard

11:44.412 --> 11:46.705
at Farpoint Station.

11:47.957 --> 11:51.376
You chose your first officer
without ever meeting him?

11:51.919 --> 11:55.046
I was looking through the records
of about 50 candidates,

11:55.214 --> 11:59.008
and Will's was very much
like all the others:

11:59.176 --> 12:02.512
filled with lots of dry statistics

12:02.680 --> 12:07.559
and glowing letters of recommendation
that tell you nothing.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.522
I was about to put it aside,
look at another file,

12:12.690 --> 12:17.444
and then something caught my eye.

12:19.989 --> 12:24.200
There was an incident on Altair IIl
when Will was first officer of the Hood.

12:24.368 --> 12:28.830
He refused to let Captain DeSoto
beam down during a crisis.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.040
He disobeyed a direct order

12:31.208 --> 12:36.087
and he risked a general court-martial
because he thought he was right.

12:37.256 --> 12:42.719
And when I read that, I knew
that I had found my Number One.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.223
You wanted someone
with a history of disobedience?

12:47.391 --> 12:49.934
I wanted someone
who would stand up to me.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.436
Someone who was more concerned

12:51.604 --> 12:54.481
with the safety of the ship
and accomplishing the mission

12:54.648 --> 12:57.484
than with how it might look
on his record.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.861
To me, that's one of the marks
of a good officer.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.365
Frankly, I've always felt
it was more important for an officer

13:04.533 --> 13:06.159
to trust his captain's judgment.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.453
In a crisis,
there's no time for explanations.

13:08.621 --> 13:12.040
Orders have to be obeyed
without question or lives may be lost.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.083
I'm aware of that, admiral.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.629
Of course you are.

13:19.924 --> 13:24.177
I guess this mission has brought up
some old ghosts for me.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.013
You know what it's like
to lose a ship?

13:27.890 --> 13:30.892
You're always wondering if there's
something else you should have done,

13:31.060 --> 13:32.602
something you missed.

13:34.396 --> 13:37.440
Admiral, the record
regarding the loss of the Pegasus

13:37.608 --> 13:43.738
is a bit vague from the moment
just before you abandoned ship.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.950
Is there anything that you can add
to the official account?

13:49.787 --> 13:51.704
I'm afraid not...

13:54.750 --> 13:56.668
...but l can tell you this.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.630
Twelve years ago, I needed an officer
that I could count on in a crisis.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.341
Someone who would support and obey
my decisions without question.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.844
Someone who was willing
to trust my judgment.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.471
And that someone was Will Riker.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.599
Without his loyalty,
none of us would have survived.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.146
[RIKER GROANS]

14:17.314 --> 14:20.149
CRUSHER: What's wrong?
- I think I busted a rib.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.277
Excuse me.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.570
What were you doing?

14:23.737 --> 14:26.114
I was doing bat'leth moves
with Mr. Worf.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.491
I jabbed
when I should have blocked.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.159
- He caught me right in the side.
- Oh.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.912
It's a good thing we were using sticks
instead of the real blades.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.622
It's broken, all right.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.000
Give him 1 0 cc's
of terakine for the pain.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.794
I can't believe how stupid I was.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.297
You both must have gotten
a little carried away, that's all.

14:42.464 --> 14:45.633
No, it was my fault.
I got distracted at a crucial moment.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.844
It can happen to anyone.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.013
I knew what I was supposed to do
and I didn't do it.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.516
If those had been real bat'leths,
I might be dead right now.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.686
There, all better.

14:57.229 --> 15:01.024
Will, it's all right.
You made a mistake, no harm done.

15:01.191 --> 15:04.944
- You'll be better next time.
- Yeah, maybe.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.540
Scan of Grid 1 57 is complete.
I am moving to Grid 1 58.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.376
The Romulan warship
is still searching Grid 270.

15:20.544 --> 15:22.629
They're sure spending a lot of time
over there.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.380
- I wonder if they--
- Commander.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.883
I think we might have
just struck pay dirt.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.973
There's a subspace
resonance signature

15:34.141 --> 15:35.892
coming from that asteroid.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.602
From the frequency variances,

15:37.770 --> 15:40.063
it looks like the pattern
of a Federation warp core.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.065
Captain Picard to the Bridge.

15:42.232 --> 15:46.235
Take us to within ten kilometers
of asteroid Gamma 601 .

15:48.697 --> 15:50.740
Geordi's found something.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.743
There's a subspace
resonance signature

15:53.911 --> 15:55.578
coming from that asteroid.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.956
Could be the warp core
of the Pegasus.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.209
I think he's right. I recognize
some of the variance patterns.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.087
Put the asteroid
on the main viewscreen.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.925
DATA:
I have confirmed Geordi's readings.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.510
The resonance signature's
originating

16:10.678 --> 16:12.470
from somewhere
beneath the asteroid's surface.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.555
Beneath the surface?
How is that possible?

16:14.723 --> 16:17.100
The asteroid
contains several deep chasms

16:17.267 --> 16:19.477
large enough for a starship to enter.

16:19.645 --> 16:24.023
It is possible the Pegasus drifted
into the asteroid's gravitational field

16:24.191 --> 16:25.942
and was pulled down
into one of the fissures.

16:26.110 --> 16:30.780
Sir, the Romulan warbird
has altered course once again.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.615
They are heading
toward our position.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.326
They probably wanna see
what we're so interested in over here.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.787
Mr. Data, how long will it take

16:37.955 --> 16:39.956
to determine the location
of the Pegasus?

16:40.124 --> 16:42.959
- At least another six hours, sir.
- That's too long.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.877
If the Romulans start
searching the asteroid,

16:45.045 --> 16:47.463
they could find the ship
before we do.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.258
I recommend
we destroy the asteroid.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.635
It would take
most of our photon torpedoes,

16:52.803 --> 16:55.138
but it would preclude any possibility
of the Pegasus

16:55.305 --> 16:56.347
falling into Romulan hands.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.766
Our top priority
is to salvage the ship, commander.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.310
I'll consider destroying it
only as a last resort.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.312
Yes, sir.

17:04.314 --> 17:08.151
Captain, could you give me
a third alternative?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.362
Mr. Data, would it be possible
to saturate the asteroid

17:11.530 --> 17:12.655
with verteron particles

17:12.823 --> 17:14.782
that would mask
the resonance signature

17:14.950 --> 17:16.909
and prevent the Romulans
from detecting it?

17:17.077 --> 17:18.745
In order
for the deception to succeed,

17:18.912 --> 17:21.372
it would have to appear
to be a natural phenomenon.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.667
Verteron particles
are artificial in nature.

17:24.835 --> 17:25.877
Wait a minute.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.255
We can blanket the asteroid
with high levels of ionizing radiation.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.132
There's so much of it
in the system already,

17:31.300 --> 17:33.134
Romulans
won't know the difference.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.012
- Mr. Data?
- Theoretically, sir, it should work.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.141
If we do this, we have to do it fast.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.102
The Romulans will be within
sensor range in less than a minute.

17:43.270 --> 17:44.353
Make it so, Mr. Data.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.940
Aye, sir.
Initiating ionization field pulse.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.776
When he's finished,
we'll have to move away

17:49.943 --> 17:51.778
and make it look
as if we scanned the asteroid

17:51.945 --> 17:53.029
but haven't found anything.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.865
Lay in a course for the next
search grid. Stand by to engage.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.867
If it works, the Romulans
won't find anything

17:58.035 --> 18:01.412
and we can return later.
If it doesn't--

18:01.580 --> 18:03.873
If it doesn't work, we'll have
handed them the Pegasus.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.043
Ionization pulse complete.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.712
Helm, one-quarter impulse.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.547
Engage.

18:21.058 --> 18:25.061
The Romulans are initiating
a tachyon scan of the asteroid.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.356
They have switched
to their lateral sensor array.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.566
Beginning another scan.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.527
They're certainly being thorough.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.531
DATA: The warbird
has completed its sensor sweep.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.616
If they found
the resonance signature,

18:38.784 --> 18:41.577
they should be sending
away teams any second.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.832
DATA:
They are moving out.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.921
Mr. Data, we must convince
the Romulans

18:52.089 --> 18:53.881
that we're still looking
for the Pegasus.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.300
I want you to continue
scanning this system.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.677
DATA:
Aye, sir.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.763
I want to be back at this asteroid
at 0800 hours tomorrow.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.432
- Plan your search pattern accordingly.
- Aye, sir.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.269
Admiral, would you care to join me
for some late dinner?

19:06.728 --> 19:09.355
Please excuse me, captain,
but I think I'd better turn in early.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.233
You have the Bridge, Number One.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.404
Oh, and will you bring
the scan analysis to my quarters

19:16.572 --> 19:17.613
when you're off watch?

19:17.781 --> 19:19.115
Aye, sir.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.951
Initiate search of Grid 163.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.245
Beginning sensor sweeps.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.248
Commander, I wanna see you
in the captain's Ready Room.

19:27.791 --> 19:30.543
- Mr. Data, you have the Bridge.
- Aye, sir.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.383
What the hell
is the matter with you?

19:37.551 --> 19:39.802
Destroy the Pegasus
before we've even taken a look at it?

19:39.970 --> 19:41.596
It was more important
that the Romulans--

19:41.763 --> 19:43.598
Well, you were wrong!

19:44.308 --> 19:47.059
We have a chance here to change
the balance of power in this quadrant,

19:47.227 --> 19:49.478
but we can't very well do that
if we destroy the Pegasus,

19:49.646 --> 19:50.813
now, can we?

19:51.148 --> 19:52.899
No, sir.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.863
It hasn't been easy for you, I'm sure,

19:59.031 --> 20:02.200
keeping your captain
and friends in the dark like this.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.328
I haven't enjoyed it,
if that's what you mean.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.164
I hope you understand
that it's necessary.

20:08.332 --> 20:12.001
I understand
that you think it's necessary.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.131
You have changed.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.759
Changed?

20:21.762 --> 20:24.764
Something the captain
and I were talking about.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.895
To be honest, I'm glad to see
this kind of change in you, Will.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.856
State your opinion and stand by it.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.609
It's a far cry from the young man
who used to sit at my helm

20:36.777 --> 20:39.487
and worry
about pressing the wrong button.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.657
A lot of things can change
in 12 years, admiral.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.701
Yes, they can,

20:45.869 --> 20:49.205
but it's important that a man
changes the right things in his life,

20:49.373 --> 20:51.415
not his sense of duty.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.334
Not his sense of loyalty.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.462
I'd like to think that
I haven't changed those things, sir.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.381
I would like to think that too.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.841
Because those things say more
about a man

21:01.009 --> 21:04.053
than the rank on his collar
or the uniform he wears.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.305
They define him.

21:11.853 --> 21:14.480
Twelve years ago, a lot of older
and more seasoned officers

21:14.648 --> 21:16.482
turned away from their duty,

21:16.650 --> 21:19.235
but you stood up for what was right.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.530
I'm sorry, Will.

21:23.282 --> 21:28.077
I know the kind of man you are.
I know that I can count on you again.

21:34.376 --> 21:35.584
[SIGHS

21:37.129 --> 21:38.170
[DOORBELL CHlMES

21:38.338 --> 21:39.839
Come.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.134
The scan analysis you asked for.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.136
Thank you.

21:45.846 --> 21:46.971
[SIGHS

21:47.431 --> 21:50.933
- Is there something else, sir?
- Yes, there is.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.440
"Judge Advocate General's report,
stardate 36764.

21:57.607 --> 22:02.611
Subject, inquiry into mutiny
aboard USS Pegasus.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.405
Based on testimonies
from Captain Pressman

22:04.573 --> 22:06.115
and other surviving officers,

22:06.283 --> 22:09.952
the judge advocate believes
there is sufficient evidence to conclude

22:10.120 --> 22:15.750
that certain members of the crew
did mutiny against the captain

22:15.917 --> 22:18.836
just prior to the destruction
of the Pegasus."

22:19.004 --> 22:25.426
Mutiny? On a Federation starship?
That's shocking. It's unthinkable.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.094
And yet you've never mentioned it.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.180
No, sir.

22:29.806 --> 22:33.893
You know,
it wasn't easy to get this report.

22:34.061 --> 22:38.814
I had to pull in quite a few favors
at Starfleet just to get a look at it.

22:39.649 --> 22:44.779
It seems that it was classified
by Starfleet lntelligence.

22:48.283 --> 22:53.496
So not only was the Pegasus

22:53.663 --> 22:56.082
carrying sensitive equipment

22:56.249 --> 22:58.793
which must not be allowed
to fall into Romulan hands,

22:58.960 --> 23:01.003
not only was there
a mysterious explosion

23:01.171 --> 23:04.465
which seemed to destroy the ship
but didn't,

23:05.675 --> 23:07.927
but it seems
that there was a mutiny onboard.

23:08.095 --> 23:12.890
Now, l've read the official report
of the inquiry on that mutiny,

23:13.058 --> 23:15.684
but I want to know
your version of what happened.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.522
I was on the Bridge.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.733
The ship was at yellow alert.

23:24.861 --> 23:27.655
We were running some tests
on the engines.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.448
Something went wrong.

23:29.616 --> 23:32.326
There was an explosion
in Engineering.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.120
Heavy casualties.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.456
In the midst of this crisis,
the first officer, chief of engineering

23:37.624 --> 23:41.043
and most of the Bridge crew
mutinied against Captain Pressman.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.461
Why?

23:42.629 --> 23:44.255
They thought
he was jeopardizing the ship.

23:44.756 --> 23:45.798
And you?

23:47.092 --> 23:48.551
I was seven months
out of the Academy,

23:48.718 --> 23:54.807
my head still ringing
with words like "duty" and "honor."

23:56.685 --> 23:58.978
When they turned on him,

23:59.146 --> 24:01.772
I thought they were a bunch
of self-serving disloyal officers,

24:01.940 --> 24:07.236
so I grabbed a phaser
and I defended my captain.

24:08.321 --> 24:11.907
Two or three others joined us,
but it was clear by then

24:12.075 --> 24:15.411
that the mutineers
had most of the crew behind them.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.747
We felt a need to get off the ship.

24:20.208 --> 24:23.878
There was a running firefight
all the way to the escape pod.

24:24.045 --> 24:26.630
About five minutes
after we left the ship,

24:27.716 --> 24:29.091
there was an explosion.

24:35.891 --> 24:40.102
"The judge advocate also believes
that the surviving officers

24:40.270 --> 24:44.190
are deliberately withholding
vital information from this inquiry.

24:44.357 --> 24:46.108
Further investigation
is recommended."

24:46.276 --> 24:47.943
Will, there was
no further investigation.

24:48.111 --> 24:53.199
This report was classified
and then it was quietly buried.

24:54.910 --> 24:55.951
Why?

24:56.453 --> 25:00.331
- May l suggest you take this up with--?
- I'm taking this up with you, Will!

25:00.499 --> 25:02.833
The judge advocate thought
that you were participating

25:03.001 --> 25:05.961
in a conspiracy to cover up the truth.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.965
Now, what the hell
is going on here, Will?

25:11.134 --> 25:12.801
Why did that mutiny happen?

25:12.969 --> 25:16.680
Why is Pressman so determined
to find your ship 12 years later?

25:16.848 --> 25:18.974
I've said all l can.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.477
I am under direct orders
from Admiral Pressman

25:21.645 --> 25:24.813
not to discuss this, sir.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.858
Very well.

25:34.324 --> 25:35.908
He's an admiral, I'm a captain.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.910
I cannot force you
to disobey his orders.

25:38.078 --> 25:42.831
Therefore, l will have to remain
in the dark on this mission,

25:43.583 --> 25:44.750
and I will just have to trust

25:44.918 --> 25:48.128
that you will not let Pressman
put this ship at unnecessary risk.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.548
And if I find that that trust
has been misplaced,

25:50.715 --> 25:54.176
then I will have to reevaluate
the command structure of this ship.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.513
Dismissed.

26:09.109 --> 26:12.027
Captain, Starfleet places
the highest priority

26:12.195 --> 26:13.779
on the success of this mission.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.282
Your request for a delay is denied.

26:16.449 --> 26:20.202
Margaret,
something's very wrong here.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.704
Do you know what's going on?

26:21.871 --> 26:24.623
l know that the chief
of Starfleet lntelligence herself

26:24.791 --> 26:26.542
is watching this one, Jean-Luc.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.044
So you'd be well advised
to follow Pressman's orders

26:29.212 --> 26:30.379
and leave it at that.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.256
Starfleet out.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.507
[SIGHS

26:33.675 --> 26:35.217
WORF [OVER COM :
Worf to Captain Picard.

26:35.385 --> 26:38.846
We are approaching
asteroid Gamma 601 , sir.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.723
On my way.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.231
Mr. Worf, where are the Romulans?

26:49.399 --> 26:52.818
They are out of sensor range
on the far side of the system.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.697
Take us to within 1 5 kilometers
of the asteroid and hold that position.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.407
Aye, sir.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.367
Mr. Data, report.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.745
For the past several hours,
I have been scanning the area

27:02.912 --> 27:05.873
where we detected the resonance
signature of the Pegasus.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.125
From the strength and polarity
of the signature,

27:08.293 --> 27:10.753
it would appear that most
of the warp core is still intact.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.881
If we're lucky, the entire Engineering
section could be down there.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.841
But how do we get to it?

27:16.009 --> 27:18.636
I wouldn't wanna try to transport
through that much solid rock.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.054
Agreed.

27:20.513 --> 27:21.555
What about a shuttle?

27:21.723 --> 27:23.724
We could send it down
through one of those fissures.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.434
I would recommend against it, sir.

27:25.602 --> 27:27.895
There may be gravimetric
or magnetic fluctuations

27:28.063 --> 27:30.606
inside the asteroid
which would overpower the engines

27:30.774 --> 27:31.857
of a shuttlecraft.

27:32.025 --> 27:34.902
Sounds like the best solution
is to take the Enterprise in.

27:37.864 --> 27:40.449
- Into the asteroid?
- That's right.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.993
Put this fissure on the main viewer.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.499
This chasm is large enough for us
to maneuver in.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.334
Besides, if we hope
to salvage the Pegasus,

27:50.502 --> 27:52.086
we're gonna need a starship to do it.

27:52.253 --> 27:53.962
Mr. Data?

27:54.130 --> 27:56.423
It is theoretically possible, sir,

27:56.591 --> 27:58.759
but I am unaware
of any prior situations

27:58.927 --> 28:02.304
where a starship was taken so deeply
inside a planetary body.

28:02.472 --> 28:05.307
There may be
unforeseen difficulties.

28:05.475 --> 28:08.143
- Admiral, I don't think we can risk--
- I've made my decision.

28:08.311 --> 28:10.979
Prepare to take
the Enterprise in, captain.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.607
That's an order.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.279
Mr. Data, will you please note
in the ship's log

28:19.447 --> 28:23.784
that this action is being taken
over my explicit objection?

28:23.952 --> 28:26.245
It is so noted, sir.

28:29.332 --> 28:30.708
- Yellow alert.
- Shields up.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.001
Inertial dampers at maximum.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.671
Ensign Gates,
plot a course into the chasm,

28:35.839 --> 28:38.173
maneuvering thrusters only.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.843
Course plotted, sir.

28:41.302 --> 28:43.011
Take us in.

29:08.496 --> 29:11.623
We are now two kilometers
beneath the surface.

29:12.542 --> 29:17.546
Captain, we are encountering shifts
in the magnetic-field density.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.471
Admiral, if this passage narrows
to less than 500 meters,

29:25.638 --> 29:27.222
I will abort the mission.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.391
You can charge me
with insubordination if you wish,

29:29.559 --> 29:32.561
but I'm not going to risk the Enterprise
for a salvage operation.

29:32.729 --> 29:36.648
Captain, l am reading a large
resonance signature directly ahead.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.246
Pegasus.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.081
What the hell happened?

29:54.584 --> 29:56.752
DATA:
Sensors show the ship is still intact.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.088
However, 65 percent of it
is contained within the asteroid.

30:00.924 --> 30:04.760
It looks as if half the ship
materialized inside solid rock.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.512
Yes, sir.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.764
I do not understand
how this could have happened.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.934
Let's keep the speculation
to a minimum.

30:12.101 --> 30:13.769
We have to begin
the salvage operation.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.813
The equipment we need
was in Main Engineering.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.689
Can you scan that section
on the Pegasus?

30:18.942 --> 30:20.567
The starboard bulkhead
of Main Engineering

30:20.735 --> 30:23.028
is contained within the rock face.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.489
Most of its compartment
is still intact.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.742
There is a hull breach
in that section.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.286
If we begin a power transfer,

30:31.454 --> 30:34.623
can we restore life-support systems
to that compartment?

30:34.791 --> 30:36.041
I believe so, sir.

30:36.209 --> 30:39.628
The breach can be temporarily sealed
by extending our shields.

30:39.796 --> 30:40.879
See to it.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.381
Once you've restored life support,

30:42.549 --> 30:44.800
Commander Riker and I
will beam directly into Engineering.

30:44.968 --> 30:47.135
Admiral, l would like to send down
a complete away team.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.221
There's some
very sensitive equipment over there.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.306
I don't want anyone else near it.

30:52.892 --> 30:54.560
Yes, sir.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.960
This room was open to space
for 12 years.

31:21.504 --> 31:24.923
Vacuum preserved everything.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.197
I wonder how many of the crew
are buried back there.

31:49.365 --> 31:51.199
PRESSMAN: We're not here
for a memorial service.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.425
It's still intact.

32:15.892 --> 32:19.436
What's the matter, Will?
Don't you understand? We found it.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.063
I know.

32:22.065 --> 32:26.485
I kept hoping it wouldn't be here.
That it had been destroyed

32:26.653 --> 32:29.780
or that it was buried
in that rock back there.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.324
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

32:33.368 --> 32:36.078
It means that I can't put this off
any longer.

32:36.245 --> 32:39.915
Right up to this moment,
I had the luxury of time,

32:40.083 --> 32:41.792
but now I've gotta make a choice.

32:42.794 --> 32:46.838
And, admiral,
I'm afraid my choice is this:

32:48.049 --> 32:51.343
I can't let you start
these experiments again.

32:51.511 --> 32:54.721
It was wrong 12 years ago
and it is wrong today.

32:54.889 --> 32:56.890
You had better reconsider
that position, commander.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.601
We have a mission to accomplish,
and you're gonna carry it out.

33:01.104 --> 33:02.938
That's all you care about.

33:03.106 --> 33:05.273
Starting these damn
experiments again.

33:05.441 --> 33:08.110
Look around.
This room is filled with dead bodies.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.112
These people died
because of this thing.

33:10.279 --> 33:13.991
Oh. Keep your self-righteous
comments to yourself.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.785
I knew most of these people
a lot longer than you did.

33:16.953 --> 33:19.037
Yes, it was tragic,
but it was their fault.

33:19.205 --> 33:20.747
You don't know that.

33:20.915 --> 33:23.208
Neither of us knows
what happened after we left.

33:23.376 --> 33:25.252
Well, it's not hard to guess.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.796
They tried to shut down
an experiment they didn't understand.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.548
Something went wrong
and it killed them.

33:29.716 --> 33:32.718
No, we killed them.

33:34.053 --> 33:36.888
Now, that doesn't sound like
the same man who grabbed a phaser

33:37.056 --> 33:39.641
and defended his captain
1 2 years ago.

33:40.018 --> 33:45.647
I've had 1 2 years to think about it,
and if I had it to do over again,

33:46.107 --> 33:49.401
I would have grabbed the phaser
and pointed it at you instead of them.

33:50.111 --> 33:54.406
So on reflection,
you'd rather be a traitor than a hero.

33:54.574 --> 33:57.492
I wasn't a hero
and neither were you.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.995
What you did was wrong,
and I was wrong to support you,

34:00.163 --> 34:03.331
but I was too young
and too stupid to realize it.

34:03.499 --> 34:05.667
You were the captain,
I was the ensign.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.502
I was just following orders.

34:07.670 --> 34:09.337
And if you hadn't,
you'd be dead right now

34:09.505 --> 34:10.756
along with all the rest of them.

34:10.923 --> 34:13.592
Dead because you listened
to a bunch of mutinous cowards

34:13.760 --> 34:16.678
who were too blinded by fear
to see what l was trying to do.

34:16.846 --> 34:19.473
They were brave enough
to risk their lives to stop you

34:19.640 --> 34:23.226
from violating a treaty
the Federation signed in good faith.

34:23.394 --> 34:26.354
That treaty has bound our hands
and given the Romulans

34:26.522 --> 34:29.024
a tactical advantage
for the last 60 years.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.526
I was simply trying to level
the playing field.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.862
And now you wanna try it again?

34:34.030 --> 34:38.366
How many people will die this time?
Fifty? A hundred? A thousand?

34:38.951 --> 34:41.078
All right,
you don't want to help me, fine,

34:41.245 --> 34:43.872
but you are still under my orders
not to talk about what you know,

34:44.040 --> 34:46.208
and I expect you
to follow those orders to the letter.

34:46.375 --> 34:49.211
I made you, mister,
and I can break you just as easily.

34:49.378 --> 34:50.712
Do you understand me,
commander?

34:53.883 --> 34:55.383
PICARD [OVER COM]:
Picard to away team.

34:55.551 --> 34:57.427
Prepare to return

34:57.595 --> 34:59.638
Stand by, Enterprise.

35:04.602 --> 35:05.727
Pressman to Enterprise.

35:05.895 --> 35:08.855
Two people and one piece
of equipment to beam up.

35:15.154 --> 35:17.155
[ALARM WAILlNG

35:21.619 --> 35:23.453
Report.

35:23.621 --> 35:26.039
The Romulans have destroyed
the entrance to the chasm

35:26.207 --> 35:28.291
with their disruptors.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.627
They've sealed us in.

35:41.472 --> 35:44.516
Sir, there is an incoming message.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.435
It is from the warbird.

35:48.062 --> 35:50.522
- On-screen.
- Aye, sir.

35:50.690 --> 35:55.318
Captain, you seem to be
in a very unfortunate circumstance.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.611
How can we help?

35:56.779 --> 35:58.071
Are you responsible for this?

35:58.239 --> 35:59.781
I'm not sure.

35:59.949 --> 36:02.742
We were conducting
some geological experiments

36:02.910 --> 36:04.619
on the surface of the asteroid.

36:04.787 --> 36:08.957
It is entirely possible
that we accidentally sealed you in.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.251
If only we had known
you were beneath the surface,

36:11.419 --> 36:15.297
if you had shared your plans with us,
this might have been avoided.

36:15.464 --> 36:17.090
What do you want, Sirol?

36:17.258 --> 36:21.553
I don't want anything, captain,
but l will offer to help you.

36:21.721 --> 36:22.762
How?

36:22.930 --> 36:26.391
By transporting
your crew aboard my ship.

36:26.559 --> 36:28.310
We'll take you back to Romulus,

36:28.477 --> 36:31.354
where after a short stay
as our guests,

36:31.522 --> 36:33.690
you will be returned
to the Federation.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.610
Thank you for your generous offer.

36:36.777 --> 36:38.820
I will take it under advisement.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.739
As you wish.

36:40.907 --> 36:45.660
We will be continuing our research
in this system for a while longer.

36:45.828 --> 36:48.038
I await your decision.

36:49.081 --> 36:50.332
We can't do it.

36:50.499 --> 36:53.585
If we abandon Enterprise, they'll come
and get their hands on both ships.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.503
Agreed. Options?

36:55.671 --> 36:59.174
Captain, l believe we could use
the phasers to cut our way out.

36:59.342 --> 37:02.385
The asteroid's internal structure
is highly unstable.

37:02.553 --> 37:03.929
Any attempt to cut through the rock

37:04.096 --> 37:06.848
could cause the entire chasm
to collapse.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.392
Captain, l have a suggestion.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.311
There's a piece of equipment

37:11.479 --> 37:13.480
in Admiral Pressman's quarters
under guard

37:13.648 --> 37:16.316
that might get us out of here.

37:16.484 --> 37:20.028
It's a prototype
for a Federation cloaking device.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.492
You just ended your career, Will.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.911
That's what it's about.

37:29.121 --> 37:31.706
A cloaking device.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.667
In the Treaty of Algeron,

37:33.834 --> 37:38.088
the Federation specifically agreed
not to develop cloaking technology.

37:38.256 --> 37:41.299
And that treaty
is the biggest mistake we ever made.

37:41.467 --> 37:44.261
It's kept us from exploiting
a vital area of defense.

37:44.428 --> 37:47.639
That treaty has kept us in peace
for 60 years.

37:47.807 --> 37:51.059
And as a Starfleet officer,
you're supposed to uphold it.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.852
Now, that's enough.

37:53.896 --> 37:56.398
I'm taking command of this vessel.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.859
Mr. Worf, escort the captain
to his quarters.

38:10.830 --> 38:14.249
I don't think anyone's going to come
to your defense this time.

38:14.417 --> 38:18.420
How do we use the cloak
to escape from the asteroid?

38:18.587 --> 38:20.547
It's more than just a cloak.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.924
It changes the structure of matter.

38:23.092 --> 38:27.762
In theory, a ship using this device
could pass through normal matter.

38:29.098 --> 38:30.849
I see why you were so eager
to find it.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.184
Then can't you see
the potential here?

38:33.352 --> 38:35.353
The phasing cloak could be
the greatest breakthrough

38:35.521 --> 38:37.939
in weapons research
in the last 50 years.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.399
Except that it's illegal.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.984
It's in violation of an agreement

38:41.152 --> 38:43.445
that the Federation signed
in good faith.

38:43.612 --> 38:48.241
Captain, l think we could
adapt the cloak for the Enterprise.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.036
Mr. Data?

38:51.203 --> 38:53.872
Theoretically, it is possible, sir,

38:54.040 --> 38:56.041
but it would take several hours
to study the device

38:56.208 --> 38:58.084
and determine how to link it
to our systems.

38:58.252 --> 38:59.794
Make it so.

39:01.422 --> 39:05.633
PICARD:
Captain's log, stardate 47457.1 .

39:05.801 --> 39:09.471
We have been trapped inside
the asteroid for over eight hours.

39:09.638 --> 39:11.848
Mr. Data and Commander La Forge
inform me

39:12.016 --> 39:14.851
that they are nearly ready
to engage the cloak.

39:17.772 --> 39:19.939
Commander, we've routed
the impulse engines

39:20.107 --> 39:21.399
through the plasma conduits,

39:21.567 --> 39:23.693
but you're gonna have to watch
the intercooler levels.

39:23.861 --> 39:27.280
If they get too high,
we'll blow the entire relay system.

39:27.448 --> 39:28.948
RlKER [OVER COM :
Understood.

39:29.992 --> 39:32.452
I think that's what happened
1 2 years ago.

39:32.620 --> 39:36.498
The cloak blew out the plasma relays
on the Pegasus after we left the ship.

39:36.665 --> 39:39.209
The plasma ignited in space,

39:39.377 --> 39:42.128
and it looked
as if the ship had been destroyed.

39:42.588 --> 39:46.508
So the ship drifted into this system
still in a phased state.

39:46.675 --> 39:49.469
And when it passed through
this asteroid...

39:49.637 --> 39:51.388
The cloak failed,

39:51.555 --> 39:54.349
and half of the ship
materialized in solid rock.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.101
LA FORGE [OVER COM]:
La Forge to Bridge.

39:56.268 --> 39:59.187
The cloak is online
and ready to begin phase sequencing.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.648
- Proceed, Number One.
- Aye, sir.

40:01.816 --> 40:04.317
Activating power systems.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.330
Report.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.374
The cloak appears
to be functioning normally.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.042
The ship's matter-energy
phasing rate

40:21.210 --> 40:23.378
should be sufficient
to pass through the asteroid.

40:24.046 --> 40:26.589
Take us out.
Maneuvering thrusters only.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.258
WORF:
Aye, sir.

40:29.176 --> 40:31.511
We will reach the rock face
in five seconds.

40:53.033 --> 40:56.244
We have passed through
two kilometers of the asteroid.

40:56.412 --> 40:58.705
Now within one kilometer
of the surface.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.835
We're approaching the surface.

41:09.425 --> 41:12.343
We have cleared
the asteroid, captain.

41:12.511 --> 41:14.471
The warbird is off the port bow.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.931
They're still waiting for us
to make up our minds.

41:18.267 --> 41:20.351
Disengage the cloaking device,
commander.

41:20.519 --> 41:22.979
You cannot do that. If the Romulans
see us decloaking, they--

41:23.147 --> 41:25.231
They'll know the truth, admiral.

41:25.399 --> 41:28.109
Which is what everyone will know
very shortly.

41:28.277 --> 41:30.403
Carry out my orders.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.664
Mr. Worf, send a message
to the warbird.

41:41.832 --> 41:44.167
Inform them that their government
will be contacted shortly

41:44.335 --> 41:45.376
about this incident.

41:45.544 --> 41:46.836
Aye, sir.

41:47.004 --> 41:52.091
Admiral, l am hereby charging you
with violation of the Treaty of Algeron.

41:52.259 --> 41:54.594
As captain of the Enterprise,
I'm placing you under arrest.

41:54.762 --> 41:56.095
Mr. Worf.

41:56.263 --> 41:57.847
Admiral, if you will come with me.

41:58.015 --> 42:02.435
Captain, l'll have to be placed
under arrest as well.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.649
Admiral.

42:07.816 --> 42:11.277
I have a lot of friends
at Starfleet Command, captain.

42:14.823 --> 42:16.991
You're going to need them.

42:40.599 --> 42:42.600
I've spoken
with Fleet Admiral Shanthi.

42:42.768 --> 42:46.229
There will be a full inquiry
once we reach Starbase 247.

42:46.397 --> 42:47.647
And that will probably lead

42:47.815 --> 42:50.233
to a general court-martial
of Admiral Pressman

42:50.401 --> 42:53.111
and several others
at Starfleet Intelligence.

42:54.697 --> 42:56.030
Your involvement in this affair

42:56.198 --> 42:58.199
is going to be
thoroughly investigated, Will.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.451
There'll be some hard questions
for you to answer.

43:01.078 --> 43:02.954
I understand.

43:10.754 --> 43:13.715
You made a mistake 1 2 years ago,

43:13.882 --> 43:16.759
but your service since then
has earned you a great deal of respect,

43:16.927 --> 43:20.888
but this incident
could cost you some of that respect.

43:21.348 --> 43:24.225
I can't help but feel that I should
have come forward a long time ago.

43:24.393 --> 43:26.477
But when the moment came
to make a decision,

43:26.645 --> 43:28.771
you made the right one.

43:28.939 --> 43:31.691
You chose to tell the truth
and face the consequences.

43:31.859 --> 43:36.779
As long as you can still do that,
then you deserve to wear that uniform.

43:37.990 --> 43:41.367
And I will still be proud
to have you as my first officer.
