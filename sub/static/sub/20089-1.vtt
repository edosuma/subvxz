<i>Just before Pap died</i>

01:17.536 --> 01:21.331
<i>He told me that I'd be fine as long as I never
depended on anybody but myself</i>

01:24.543 --> 01:27.754
<i>I made Pap's grave just like
he had done Mama's.</i>

01:28.714 --> 01:31.758
<i>All I had to remember her face
was one picture Pap kept.</i>

01:32.885 --> 01:35.179
<i>but I can remember in the bed at night</i>

01:36.054 --> 01:38.015
<i>keeping me warm from the other side</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:49.443
<i>Pap said people passed on
and came back as some kind of animal</i>

01:50.611 --> 01:52.613
<i>that the old part of them would
float around  like smoke</i>

01:52.905 --> 01:55.741
<i>and a person could burn
letters and talk to them that way</i>

01:57.868 --> 01:59.912
<i>He said my momma was a
yellow finch now.</i>

02:00.204 --> 02:03.040
<i>I mostly thought of her that way</i>

02:13.634 --> 02:17.596
<i>I was 11 years old and Pap said he taught me
everything I needed to know</i>

02:17.763 --> 02:18.931
<i>about living in the forest</i>

02:20.766 --> 02:25.187
<i>When it came to fightin', he said he figured I could
whip someone 3 times my size..</i>

02:31.360 --> 02:33.362
<i>but he mostly talked about the government</i>

02:34.404 --> 02:35.489
<i>said they were after us</i>

02:36.532 --> 02:37.699
<i>said they'd always be after us</i>

02:38.784 --> 02:41.620
<i>and one day a war would come</i>

02:41.787 --> 02:43.956
<i>and I'd have to fightem and be ready
to die for what was right</i>

03:12.025 --> 03:13.861
Pap look!

03:21.410 --> 03:22.536
What's that Pap?

03:47.436 --> 03:50.480
 -What are they doing Pap?
- Making a road.

03:52.608 --> 03:53.734
Why?

04:29.061 --> 04:30.187
Who are they, Pap?

04:31.355 --> 04:33.190
I don't know.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.484
Fill up the canteen. I'm going into town.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.654
Yeah. Bring some vegetables
for us to sell?

04:39.363 --> 04:41.448
We don't have time for that.
Fill up the canteen like I told you.

05:30.706 --> 05:31.832
Pa, I did it!

05:36.003 --> 05:39.131
- How are you, Ali? Moon?
- George

05:40.007 --> 05:42.259
- What you two have for me today?
 - Nothing.

05:43.302 --> 05:44.303
What's going on with the dozers?

05:46.305 --> 05:48.432
I hate to tell ya, Ali...

05:49.433 --> 05:52.477
Heard that a lawyer from Birmingham
bought up a big track from the paper company.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.479
12,000 acres

05:54.646 --> 05:57.900
- They're going to build a big huntin' lodge.
- What else you know?

05:58.859 --> 06:01.987
Oh, not much, just what I heard from a couple
fellows come in here to buy coats and such...

06:09.369 --> 06:11.371
Do I get to buy anything? Pap!

06:12.497 --> 06:14.458
You keep up, you hear me?

06:18.754 --> 06:21.632
<i>Nothing was ever the same after
the bulldozers came.</i>

06:23.050 --> 06:27.888
<i>Even though I watched his face,
I didn't know what Pap was thinking anymore.</ I ></i>

06:29.056 --> 06:32.059
<i>Sometimes it was like,
he didn't know I was there.</i>

06:57.376 --> 07:00.295
<i>A couple weeks passed before the
bulldozers grew silent.</i>

07:01.421 --> 07:03.382
<i>We started hearing the hammering.</i>

07:04.424 --> 07:06.426
<i>which made Pap even more nervous.</i>

07:10.681 --> 07:12.808
<i>He got upset over the
smallest mistakes.</i>

07:14.935 --> 07:15.978
Alright.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.814
<i>We made one more trip to Mr. Aberscotti's store</i>

07:18.981 --> 07:21.733
<i>when the vegetables ripened in the fall</i>

07:22.943 --> 07:25.654
<i>That was the last time Pap left the forest alive.</i>

07:29.408 --> 07:31.243
Ahh, South America's Andes.
lt and it's

07:31.368 --> 07:33.370
...fringing islands...

07:34.288 --> 07:37.499
- are basically a jagged...
- Stop reading outloud.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.838
You're old enough to
read to yourself now.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.205
Pa! Pa!

08:20.292 --> 08:21.376
Help me!

08:23.337 --> 08:24.421
Pa!

08:34.806 --> 08:35.890
Help me!

09:12.261 --> 09:14.346
Tell me again why we live out  here.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.603
Because you never ask for anything.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.731
Nobody ever give us anything either.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.152
Go on.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.779
 Because of that...

09:31.947 --> 09:33.991
We don't owe anything to anybody.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.869
Who it that thinks we owe them something?

09:38.328 --> 09:39.496
The government.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.671
I'm not gonna get any better.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.265
What are we gonna do?

10:01.518 --> 10:03.478
I'm not gonna make it.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.777
You're gonna to die?

10:16.116 --> 10:18.994
- When? Tonight?
- No. But soon.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.375
This leg is gonna get infected

10:26.418 --> 10:28.378
What will I do?

10:35.928 --> 10:38.805
The paper company that owned this land

10:39.014 --> 10:41.934
was too big to notice us out here.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.228
But that new owner is gonna find you.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.272
and he'll send the law.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.319
You need to leave here, Moon...

10:52.569 --> 10:54.530
and go find other people like us.

10:56.782 --> 11:01.870
Most of them are out  west, in
Montana, Colorado, Wyoming.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.501
Alaska's even better.

11:09.127 --> 11:12.256
A man can still homestead  in Alaska

11:12.589 --> 11:15.384
Find a place where nobody can find him.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.597
You gonna have to find your
way up there, son.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.938
- But how...
- You'll figure it out.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.233
You can't rely on me anymore.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.904
You just remember what I taught you.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.448
And don't you trust nobody.

11:40.576 --> 11:44.538
If you get lonely, you
can write me smoke  letters.

11:44.830 --> 11:47.749
But how will I get answers from the smoke?

11:51.003 --> 11:55.048
I want to burn that picture of your mom
and put me and her both out of your head.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.302
You'll feel lonely for awhile...

12:00.262 --> 12:02.973
but it will go away if you ain't
carrying things to set it off.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.937
How will I get anwers from
the smoke Pap?

12:12.816 --> 12:14.776
You just do what I tell you, son

12:15.903 --> 12:20.991
- I don't want you to die!
- Shut up my boy, you don't cry.

12:22.284 --> 12:25.454
You hear me?
You'll be alright.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.630
I  don't want to hear anymore about it.

12:49.311 --> 12:53.315
<i>After I buried Pap,
I felt the lonliness he told me about</i>

12:53.482 --> 12:55.484
<i>crawlin' up my stomach
and up into my throat.</i>

12:59.112 --> 13:02.199
<i>lt didn't seem like anything
that would go away anytime soon.</i>

13:23.178 --> 13:27.391
Dear Pap, I'm gonna start
for Alaska tomorrow.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.435
Maybe you can talk to me soon.

13:43.657 --> 13:44.658
Pap!

13:58.255 --> 14:00.340
Pap! Wait, Pap!

14:10.767 --> 14:12.895
Pap! Pap!

15:03.070 --> 15:05.072
Easy now, easy.

15:05.197 --> 15:07.074
I not gonna hurt you.

15:12.371 --> 15:16.375
You're the boy the store owner
told me about, aren't ya?

15:16.542 --> 15:18.418
Where's your father?

15:19.837 --> 15:21.797
I buried him. He's dead.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.926
When did that happen?

15:28.136 --> 15:30.013
Yesterday.

15:32.099 --> 15:36.228
- I shouldn't be here.
- Hold on, where do you plan to go?

15:37.396 --> 15:39.231
I gotta get away from the law.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.527
How about some food?

15:45.696 --> 15:48.824
I've got a sweet roll that's
sittin' on the counter in there.

15:48.991 --> 15:51.493
You stay right here.
I'll be right back with it.

16:34.620 --> 16:35.871
Take it easy.

16:36.914 --> 16:38.874
We're just trying to help.

16:47.341 --> 16:49.176
You should've grabbed that boy!

16:49.384 --> 16:51.220
Rabbit

16:52.346 --> 16:54.473
Pap was right. The
law was after me.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.517
I'll have to make to Alaska.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.928
Where you think you're going, boy?

18:18.056 --> 18:19.975
Where'd you bury your daddy?

18:20.142 --> 18:23.437
You know you cant just go off buring
people without the law involved.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.357
I know a thing or two
about trackin'.

18:27.816 --> 18:28.984
I'll find your stick hut.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.156
Ahh, reach for it and
see what happens boy

18:37.576 --> 18:39.369
I didn't do nothing to nobody!

18:39.578 --> 18:40.537
Ahh, quit bowing up to  me

18:41.705 --> 18:43.582
Now get in the car before
I knock you sideways.

18:43.749 --> 18:44.833
- Get in the car
- No

18:53.967 --> 18:55.302
Settle down!

18:56.345 --> 18:58.388
Come on boy, get in the car.
Get in there!

20:19.845 --> 20:20.888
Where are we going?

20:23.015 --> 20:24.892
Where are we going?!

20:27.227 --> 20:29.062
When will I get my things back?

20:30.189 --> 20:31.231
When ready to give'em

20:34.318 --> 20:38.280
Can't help but think I'll be seeing you
in and out of jail your whole life, boy.

20:39.573 --> 20:41.533
Pure bread white trash.

20:41.533 --> 20:42.576
Don't  need that in my town.

20:44.536 --> 20:48.373
People like your pap. Poachin'
and trespassin' for a livin'.

20:47.789 --> 20:50.959
Don't you ever talk mean about Pap!
Ever!

20:52.878 --> 20:54.588
Well what ya goin' do about it?

20:56.256 --> 20:58.008
That's what I thought.

21:22.157 --> 21:23.200
Go!

21:29.623 --> 21:31.375
Open the gate

21:41.969 --> 21:43.095
Where is your daddy, kid?

21:49.434 --> 21:52.312
Man, can you believe it's really him?

21:52.521 --> 21:53.522
This way boy.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.984
Alright, back on the line,
let's go.

21:59.862 --> 22:03.699
Thank you Constable Sanders, the boy
will be safe in our care.

22:03.949 --> 22:06.493
You best put restraints on this
boy before I leave.

22:07.035 --> 22:11.039
- I don't think he's going  anywhere.
- I telling you, this kid's an animal

22:11.248 --> 22:14.168
He'll be on you like a wet cat
you do not tie him down.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.337
This is our watchman, Mr. Carter.

22:17.546 --> 22:19.423
He'll handle Moon from here.

22:22.801 --> 22:24.636
A wet cat.

22:26.722 --> 22:30.225
Mr Carter, get this boy a
uniform and show him to his bunk.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.061
Come on son.

22:40.360 --> 22:44.031
The rest of the residents are in
the school trailers right now.

22:44.198 --> 22:46.158
You got 16 boys in your bunk room.

22:46.992 --> 22:48.994
Chances are,
you'll find a friend.

22:49.328 --> 22:51.288
I'm not going to be here
long enough to need friends.

22:52.331 --> 22:54.416
I'm busting out.
Soon as I find a way.

22:55.501 --> 22:58.462
You better get that
out of your head.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.548
You'll be fine and learn to like it.

23:01.757 --> 23:03.800
Just follow the rules.
Come on.

23:05.928 --> 23:07.804
What's this for?

23:13.227 --> 23:15.062
You haven't started yet?

23:16.480 --> 23:20.275
Turn that lever.
Let's go.

23:55.811 --> 23:57.020
Find bunk 14.
That's you.

23:58.939 --> 24:01.191
Those other boys will be comin'
out of class soon.

24:02.067 --> 24:03.277
They come through here
to clean up for supper.

24:04.361 --> 24:08.365
You hitch a ride with them
to the mess hall, alright?

24:39.605 --> 24:40.731
You the one
all over the news?

24:41.648 --> 24:42.733
Well, I don't know
about any of that.

24:45.068 --> 24:48.989
- It said you fought a cop.
- I didn't want to go with him.

24:50.157 --> 24:55.162
- He don't  look so tough to me.
- I could whip you.

24:55.329 --> 24:56.371
Fight! Fight! Fight!

24:56.538 --> 24:58.290
Fight! Fight! Fight!

25:04.713 --> 25:07.758
Everybody! To your bunks.
Now!

25:10.636 --> 25:12.429
Whatta you do to him?

25:12.638 --> 25:14.473
Well I hit in the balls
as hard as I could.

25:14.765 --> 25:16.642
He curled up on the floor all on his own.

25:17.226 --> 25:20.020
I guess you weren't
provoking him, were you Hal?

25:22.064 --> 25:23.106
That's what I thought.

25:23.524 --> 25:26.360
I'm tired of you mouth
and your trouble.

25:26.527 --> 25:30.531
You be sleepin' outside again tonight,
without any supper.

25:30.906 --> 25:32.866
The rest you...
go back to your business.

25:34.034 --> 25:37.829
Miss Broomstead will ring the supper
bell in 10 minutes.

26:02.145 --> 26:03.981
I can sit here?

26:09.319 --> 26:10.362
My name is Kit

26:18.829 --> 26:21.707
So ahh... How's your first day going?

26:30.090 --> 26:31.175
Thanks

26:33.427 --> 26:37.306
- What's that?
-uhh...my pills.

26:38.473 --> 26:41.435
- Are they any good?
- No, it's medicine.

26:41.685 --> 26:43.604
I have to take them
my whole  life.

27:06.543 --> 27:09.546
Yeah...you're supposed to put
those on to sleep in.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.924
- How come?
- that's just the rules.

27:13.008 --> 27:17.930
You  put your uniform in the locker
that says 14, like your bunk.

27:21.266 --> 27:23.393
- Hey, where are you going?
- Outside.

27:24.436 --> 27:26.522
- Why?
- To sleep.

27:27.397 --> 27:29.441
No. Hal's out there.
He wants to kill you!

27:29.608 --> 27:32.611
- Oh yeah, I know. He already told me.
- No Moon!

27:32.819 --> 27:35.781
Mr. Carter is not here to save you.

27:45.165 --> 27:47.376
- What are you doing here?
- I like it better ouside.

27:48.377 --> 27:50.420
Go to sleep in my bed.
Pretend to be me.

27:51.421 --> 27:54.424
- You crazy?
- No. I just like it better outside.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.679
Well...Mr. Carter is gonna
 kick my ass if he catches me.

27:58.929 --> 28:00.722
And maybe yours is too.

28:00.931 --> 28:02.808
Well you just go snuggle up
nice in those covers.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.401
Yeah. Alright.

29:35.901 --> 29:38.904
OK, OK, slow down. I mean
you're going to make yourself sick.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.949
I never had all I
can eat before.

29:49.998 --> 29:51.959
Hey. I don't think Hal's
mad at you anymore.

29:52.584 --> 29:57.589
Since he's almost 14. I mean...they send you to a place
called Hellenwilder when you're 14.

29:59.675 --> 30:01.760
You know...not everybody's
mean like Hal.

30:02.845 --> 30:06.849
- You can make some friends here
- I never had friends.

30:08.976 --> 30:10.143
Well uh...

30:12.104 --> 30:13.313
I could be your friend.

30:22.531 --> 30:25.742
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's uh...that's Rachel.

30:26.743 --> 30:28.871
- She's Mr. Gene's daughter.
- She lives here?

30:29.621 --> 30:33.625
No no no no ummm. She  lives out back
in Mr. Gene's house on the weekends...

30:33.834 --> 30:36.336
...and lives with her mom during the week.

30:36.378 --> 30:38.672
Okay...don't tell anyone...I mean no one...

30:38.672 --> 30:41.800
...she and Hal have been kissing
through the player in the fence.

30:42.593 --> 30:43.927
ewww.

30:44.178 --> 30:47.097
I bet  Mr. Gene hates that.

30:47.181 --> 30:51.185
Yeah...ah, you know
he kinda doesn't know.

30:55.397 --> 30:56.565
Need you to come with me after breakfast

30:56.773 --> 30:58.734
Mr. Gene wants to see you.

31:03.989 --> 31:05.866
There you are, Moon

31:07.159 --> 31:09.077
That's mine.
Give it back.

31:09.286 --> 31:11.455
We'll keep all your things in a safe
place for you.

31:20.923 --> 31:23.008
What's on my hat?

31:23.967 --> 31:26.929
You mean this?

31:29.097 --> 31:31.183
This is not part of the Pinson uniform.

31:32.434 --> 31:34.853
Those are your school books
for Monday morning.

31:34.853 --> 31:36.980
Take them and have a seat.

31:39.650 --> 31:42.486
I hear you have plans
to run away?

31:43.695 --> 31:45.739
Let me tell you about Pinson.

31:45.906 --> 31:48.992
First of all, we've never had
anyone escape,

31:48.992 --> 31:51.036
or bust out as you put it.

31:51.119 --> 31:54.248
And second of all, you are now
 property of the state

31:54.331 --> 31:56.333
and will remail so until you turn
18 years of age.

31:56.416 --> 31:58.293
Look at me when I'm
speaking to you.

31:58.502 --> 32:03.423
If, someone comes to claim you,
you will be released into their custody.

32:03.632 --> 32:05.801
Do you understand?

32:05.801 --> 32:08.637
 If you behave, you
will have no problems here.

32:09.721 --> 32:13.892
But any more talk of escape, then
your stay here will not be pleasant.

32:15.143 --> 32:17.938
- Alight.
- Alright what?

32:18.146 --> 32:21.316
- I won't talk about it anymore.
- Very well.

32:22.317 --> 32:24.486
Go put your books away
and report to the kitchen

32:24.528 --> 32:27.322
to see Mrs. Broomstead
to get that hair cut.

32:40.711 --> 32:42.171
Don't cut it short.

32:42.337 --> 32:44.423
Me and Pap always wear it long
in the winter to keep warm.

32:44.631 --> 32:46.675
You don't have to worry about that here.

32:47.885 --> 32:49.928
I don't plan on
staying  long.

32:50.804 --> 32:52.806
We'll see about that.

32:52.973 --> 32:54.850
Better not be any
bugs in here.

32:55.809 --> 32:57.394
there's no bugs in here.

32:59.062 --> 33:00.981
Better not be.

33:10.741 --> 33:12.743
- Okay?
- Looks good.

33:16.997 --> 33:19.875
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:20.125 --> 33:23.128
I heard about you. You're that
boy that lived in the forest.

33:24.087 --> 33:26.173
- Right?
- Ahhh, yeah.

33:26.298 --> 33:27.132
Rachel.

33:27.132 --> 33:28.926
What did I tell you?

33:29.259 --> 33:31.094
I just said hey to him.

33:31.303 --> 33:33.514
Get outside. Or go
watch TV the house.

33:43.273 --> 33:45.025
Pitch it here. Over here.

33:45.025 --> 33:48.529
- He's over there.
- Yeah, I see him. Let's go get him.

33:50.280 --> 33:53.242
- Hey, did Mr. Gene get mad at you?
- No, he gave me some  books.

33:53.450 --> 33:55.827
Yeah, the're for
school on Monday.

33:55.869 --> 33:57.955
I won't need them. I'm going over
the fence tonight.

33:58.038 --> 33:58.872
You wanna come?

33:58.914 --> 34:02.709
- Hey, you can't make it over the fence.
- Sure I can, I figured out a way.

34:02.751 --> 34:04.169
We'll find some woods to hide
in til spring.

34:04.211 --> 34:05.879
then we'll head for Alaska.

34:06.213 --> 34:07.339
Yeah. Will it just be us?

34:07.464 --> 34:10.384
We need a big guy like
Hal to drive us out of here.

34:11.510 --> 34:13.512
Moon, Hal hates both of us.

34:14.638 --> 34:17.808
- I'll go talk to him.
- But Moon...

34:18.559 --> 34:20.643
It was all stuck together.

34:23.856 --> 34:26.942
- I ain't mad at you anymore.
- I'm not worried about that.

34:28.110 --> 34:29.235
I need to talk to you.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.112
Alone.

34:34.157 --> 34:36.034
Catch you guys later.

34:41.290 --> 34:43.333
- You know how to drive.
- Sure

34:43.500 --> 34:45.335
Dad taught me a lot about cars.

34:45.502 --> 34:47.337
Good.
Because I'm busting out tonight.

34:47.504 --> 34:50.632
- We need someone to drive us.
- I knew you were crazy

34:50.841 --> 34:52.467
You ain't gettin' out of here.

34:52.551 --> 34:54.553
Yes I am.
And I'm not crazy.

34:58.974 --> 35:01.810
- What's your problem?
- Hey. I'm coming too.

35:02.060 --> 35:04.104
You kiddin'? You can't go
a day without medicine.

35:04.188 --> 35:05.314
You don't know about me Hal!

35:05.439 --> 35:08.483
Moon says he can make medicine from
things he finds in the forrest.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.446
You sure you don't
need your pills?

35:12.529 --> 35:14.615
Nah, I don't need them.

35:15.699 --> 35:16.992
No, they don't do anything anyway.

35:17.159 --> 35:20.078
Fine then. If he's coming,
I'm bringing  Rachel.

35:25.083 --> 35:27.169
You got a plan or something?
This big escape.

35:45.896 --> 35:46.939
And we're out!

35:47.105 --> 35:48.065
What about Rachel?

35:53.320 --> 35:55.197
Yeah. We'll get her.

35:57.032 --> 35:57.824
- You sure?
- Yeah.

36:00.619 --> 36:02.663
We're good.

36:19.429 --> 36:21.265
Come on.

36:37.990 --> 36:40.033
Right there, right there.

36:43.245 --> 36:44.413

36:50.127 --> 36:50.669

36:51.587 --> 36:53.714
Come on, hurry.

36:54.715 --> 36:56.758

just saw it up there

36:59.928 --> 37:01.930
- Hurry, Moon.

37:03.098 --> 37:05.017
- You got it?
- Yeah.

37:13.525 --> 37:16.236

- Come on, just help me lift this up.

37:17.779 --> 37:19.615
Get it! Come on!

37:22.910 --> 37:23.952
Alright, we're almost there.

37:24.912 --> 37:26.121
Last screw.

37:28.123 --> 37:30.167

37:40.802 --> 37:42.721
Alright now.
Kit go.

37:43.889 --> 37:45.807
Now Hal, follow him.

37:46.975 --> 37:48.977
As soon as you get to the edge,
just jump off.

37:52.105 --> 37:53.148
YES!

37:55.275 --> 37:57.361
- Hal, come on, it's easy.
- Hal, jump.

37:58.278 --> 37:59.363
Come on Hal, jump.

38:03.534 --> 38:05.577
Alright. Come on Moon.
Let's go.

38:05.702 --> 38:07.621
What about everybody else?

38:09.665 --> 38:10.749
What about 'em?

38:10.916 --> 38:12.835
- Well I figured they'd all wanna come.
- What?

38:13.001 --> 38:15.128
- You can't be serious.
- Yeah. Go get the bus, Hal.

38:16.046 --> 38:17.047
I'll be right back.

38:18.215 --> 38:20.133
My butt is so caught.

38:30.811 --> 38:32.604
Wake up everybody!

38:32.855 --> 38:34.815
We're busting out of here!
Come on!

Come on.

38:44.199 --> 38:45.242
Come on.

39:43.592 --> 39:45.469
This is so wild.
Daddy's going to be so mad.

39:47.054 --> 39:49.765
You guys get them to shut the hell
up and just stop rockin' the bus.

39:50.057 --> 39:52.017
They're going crazy back here, Hal.
- Yeah, I know!

39:52.142 --> 39:54.061
- Where we going, Moon
- To the woods!

39:54.228 --> 39:57.022
- Where will we live?
- We will make a giant shelter with traps.

39:57.147 --> 39:59.983

- Yeah!

40:00.359 --> 40:02.528

- Yeah!

40:04.446 --> 40:07.616
- And we'll whup up on anybody who tries to catch us!
- Yeah!

40:07.783 --> 40:10.744
You guys stop screaming and
tell me where the hell I'm going?

40:10.869 --> 40:11.787
To the woods, Hal.

40:11.954 --> 40:13.914
Great plans,
I don't even know what road I'm on.

40:13.997 --> 40:16.083
There's a sign. Talladega
National Forest.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.085
Yeah yeah, go to
that one, Hal?

40:19.253 --> 40:21.338
This is crazy

40:26.802 --> 40:28.929
Yeah!

40:32.724 --> 40:35.644
- How much further Moon
- Just right up here.

40:51.368 --> 40:54.496
Wake up everybody.
We're as far as we can go.

40:57.624 --> 40:58.709
The forest is all around us.

40:59.877 --> 41:01.837
I don't wanna bust
out anymore.

41:03.046 --> 41:05.507
Yeah, Mr. Gene is going
to be mad about this.

41:07.217 --> 41:09.052
But I thought everybody wanted to come.

41:09.261 --> 41:12.347
Let'em stay, Moon. I don't want
to deal with a bunch of cry babies.

41:13.265 --> 41:16.476
- You're coming, aren't you Kit?
- Of course I'm coming.

41:18.604 --> 41:20.564
Alright. You can go on and
I'll stay with them

41:21.732 --> 41:23.775
But I thought we were gonna
to go in the woods together.

41:24.735 --> 41:25.903
I have cheerleading on Monday.

41:26.820 --> 41:28.030
and I just wanted to come
along for the bus ride.

41:31.116 --> 41:33.076
Everybody who wants
stay, Rachel going to be here.

41:34.119 --> 41:36.246
The law's going to come around before long.
They'll take you back.

41:37.372 --> 41:39.541
What makes you so sure, Moon?

41:40.584 --> 41:42.377
The law's always after me.

41:47.883 --> 41:49.885
- What you doing in there?
- Kissing her?

41:55.974 --> 41:58.268
She wants to give you a good
luck kiss. One the cheek.

41:59.311 --> 42:02.356
- How long is that going to take?
- It better not take  long.

42:21.124 --> 42:22.292
Come on guys.
Let's just go.

42:32.594 --> 42:34.513
Yes, sir.

42:35.681 --> 42:36.723
Yes, sir.

42:37.808 --> 42:40.018
They located the bus and
everyone is safe.

42:40.894 --> 42:44.147
Yes, sir.
Well, all but three.

42:44.398 --> 42:45.357
I know.

42:46.149 --> 42:48.235
I know.
We're doing what we can sir.

42:49.444 --> 42:51.196
Yes, sir.

42:52.531 --> 42:57.536
I hope you can track him down like he
said. I'm about to lose my job.

42:57.744 --> 43:00.664
My schedule is pretty busy
for the next couple days.

43:00.873 --> 43:02.666
This means a lot to me.

43:03.876 --> 43:06.920
- A lot.
- Well in that case...

43:08.088 --> 43:10.174
I might be able to rearrange
my case load.

43:11.091 --> 43:12.176
Just do what you gotta do.

43:14.219 --> 43:15.345
I'll tell you you what
you gotta do.

43:18.515 --> 43:20.642
You gotta treat and
animal like an animal.

43:21.643 --> 43:23.645
That boy needs dogs on him

43:23.812 --> 43:25.731
and a leash to bring him back with

43:26.773 --> 43:30.819
and then, you've gotta put restraints on that boy
like I told you when I first brought him.

43:30.903 --> 43:31.945
Okay.

43:32.070 --> 43:34.907
From this point forward,
we're gonna do things my way

43:35.115 --> 43:37.159
on my terms.

43:38.243 --> 43:41.288
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

44:01.266 --> 44:03.310
Let's go Snapper,
find him.

44:04.436 --> 44:06.271
Find him boy. Come on!
Let's go to work.

44:24.289 --> 44:27.167
- How much further?
- We can not stop now

44:27.292 --> 44:29.211
we gotta get to where
nobody can find us.

44:31.380 --> 44:34.424
- All right, Kit?
- I'm fine, Moon.

44:35.717 --> 44:37.636
Come on.
Let's go.

44:46.103 --> 44:48.188
- When do we eat?
- Soon.

44:52.401 --> 44:55.279
Quick, dogs! Come on guys,
quick. We gotta cover our steps.

45:10.169 --> 45:11.962
There you go boy!

45:15.215 --> 45:16.300
Come back here Snapper!

45:32.858 --> 45:33.901
Snapper!

45:40.240 --> 45:41.450
Didn't work,
it's heading up the creek.

45:42.367 --> 45:43.410
Crap!
Now what?

45:44.411 --> 45:45.454
You two go hide in the bushes!

45:46.413 --> 45:49.708
- What about you, Moon?
- I'm gonna fight it.

45:50.792 --> 45:53.086
Fight it?
Hell, you can not fight a dog!

45:53.212 --> 45:55.422
I ain't going back to Pinson
and neither are you.

45:55.589 --> 45:57.549
Come on, Kit,
do what you whatever you want.

46:12.564 --> 46:13.607
Watch your head.

46:19.821 --> 46:22.074
Stay! Stay back!
Stay! Stay! Stay back!

46:27.287 --> 46:29.456
You're a good dog,
come on.

46:30.374 --> 46:31.416
Come here, boy.

46:34.545 --> 46:36.463
- No, stop it!
- We gotta do something!

46:36.630 --> 46:38.549
- That dog's killing Moon.
- Get off me!

46:38.715 --> 46:41.677
Get away from me.
Help! Somebody help!

46:45.264 --> 46:46.682
Ahhh...heel.

46:47.057 --> 46:49.560
- Get him off of me!
- You're okay, he looks like a Nice dog.

46:50.269 --> 46:52.020
Stop!
Some bloodhound.

46:53.438 --> 46:55.232
He wants to stay with us.

46:56.400 --> 46:58.819
Yes he does.
That's a good boy.

47:02.030 --> 47:04.032
Snapper!

47:04.908 --> 47:06.785
Get back here,
you dumb blood!

47:29.725 --> 47:32.686
Snapper.
 Davy Sanders, Gainesville Alabama

47:32.895 --> 47:34.980
Sanders is out there and his
dog doesn't like him either.

47:35.147 --> 47:37.107
- Who's Sanders?
- The Law.

47:37.983 --> 47:39.234
Great, now the law's
after us.

47:40.152 --> 47:42.946
That is good,
they'll have a hard time finding us way out here.

47:46.408 --> 47:48.452
- Look Hall, I did it!
- Great!

47:48.702 --> 47:51.580
I'm just waiting for the food
part of all this.

47:56.960 --> 47:59.838
- I can feel him, he's somewhere around here.
- Yeah.

48:06.178 --> 48:08.305
Put it over there by the light,
I think he's moving.

48:12.434 --> 48:15.479
- Oh gosh, that's so cool
- Told you I'd catch something.

48:15.687 --> 48:18.649
- Yeah. What kind is it?
- A catfish

48:19.858 --> 48:23.403
- You were hungry, weren't you boy?
- Hey, he sure does like you Hal.

48:23.987 --> 48:26.990
Yeah, well, I ain't one to be
mean to dogs.

48:27.241 --> 48:29.910
You feel better now that
you ate all that fish, don't ya?

48:30.202 --> 48:33.163
- It was pretty good.
- I thought it was great.

48:33.372 --> 48:36.625
Enjoy while you can. See how long
you can last out here without your medicine.

48:37.501 --> 48:40.629
I don't need my medicine Hal.
You'll find that you're so...

48:41.630 --> 48:42.756
How'd you get to Alabama
anyway Kit?

48:45.926 --> 48:49.888
I was sent from Boston to live with
my Aunta Montgomery.

48:50.013 --> 48:51.974
by the time I got
there, she'd...

48:52.099 --> 48:57.229
she died. Then I got sent
to a hospital again in Birmingham

48:58.355 --> 49:01.358
well then they took me to
a place in Selma.

49:02.526 --> 49:05.696
You know, I was in the hospital for so
long, they just never sent me back.

49:06.321 --> 49:09.283
That's what they call real
property of the state,  Moon.

49:09.366 --> 49:10.534
So are you Hal...

49:11.118 --> 49:12.995
From now on, you guys won't have
to worry about any of this

49:13.036 --> 49:13.954
any more.

49:14.121 --> 49:16.081
I'd  been fine if they'd just
let me stay with my daddy.

49:16.206 --> 49:19.126
I mean, he may have been drunk all the
time, but is the best dad there is.

49:24.548 --> 49:27.467
You know, I just don't want to go back
to another hospital ever again.

49:27.759 --> 49:31.638
I don't want more needles in my back.
And I don't want my hair falling out.

49:32.890 --> 49:33.807
Do not worry, Kit.

49:35.934 --> 49:40.063
Just figure another half day before we start
looking for places to make permanent camp.

49:41.231 --> 49:43.192
We just gotta get
ahead of Sanders first.

49:44.401 --> 49:46.195
Do you think he can
make it all this way, Moon?

49:46.486 --> 49:49.406
- Not really, no.
- Good Night

49:49.615 --> 49:52.534
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

50:38.622 --> 50:41.416
- What's that?
- It's a pig trap.

50:41.708 --> 50:43.710
- For trappin' wild pigs.
- Pig trap?

50:44.628 --> 50:45.754
Moon, does that mean they're
people around?

50:46.755 --> 50:49.758
Nah, too over grown.
Hasn't been used in years.

50:50.050 --> 50:52.052
But maybe we can clean
it out and use it again.

50:52.970 --> 50:54.096
Wild pigs are awful
good eatin'.

50:55.389 --> 50:58.517
- There look, puma tracks.
- Pumas? Moon, you gotta be kidding me.

50:58.517 --> 51:00.227
First wild pigs and
and now pumas.

51:00.310 --> 51:01.562
They won't hurt anything our size.

51:01.645 --> 51:04.398
Pap said they need at
least 30 square miles of territory.

51:06.733 --> 51:09.862
So...that means we're
far from any people?

51:10.904 --> 51:13.824
We'll make permanent camp on
the south side of the ravine.

51:14.867 --> 51:17.077
Then we'll start
our training for Alaska.

51:30.757 --> 51:32.676
- Oh, thanks.
- Here you go Moon.

51:33.677 --> 51:34.887
Ohh, thank you.

51:42.227 --> 51:44.146
That better not be rain.

51:52.446 --> 51:54.531
We'll finish making
the shelter tomorrow

51:54.740 --> 51:56.658
then we'll make traps
to catch food.

51:56.825 --> 51:58.827
- and then we'll...
- Shut up, Moon!

52:11.215 --> 52:12.299
Ummm shoot!

52:19.598 --> 52:22.601
- Hey Moon.
- Looks good.

52:23.852 --> 52:26.313
Where's Hal?

52:27.689 --> 52:29.066
He left.

52:31.235 --> 52:33.529
Where'd he go?

52:33.529 --> 52:35.447
He said he was going
home to live with his daddy.

52:35.447 --> 52:37.241
Home?

52:37.533 --> 52:39.409
How long has he been gone?

52:40.118 --> 52:41.203
Hal.

52:42.079 --> 52:43.205
Hal.

52:44.998 --> 52:46.124
Hal.

52:50.921 --> 52:53.048
Think Hal's gonna make it?

52:53.340 --> 52:55.175
Hal's gonna make it.

52:55.926 --> 52:57.094
He's got that trackin' dog.

52:58.303 --> 53:00.222
They'll find their way back.

53:02.391 --> 53:03.559
I just wanted to see his daddy.

53:07.521 --> 53:08.564
I know.

53:09.857 --> 53:12.985
I want that too.

53:13.777 --> 53:15.863
I'd stay here no matter what.

53:17.948 --> 53:19.074
This is where I wanna be, Moon

53:29.626 --> 53:31.461
This is called a 4 trap.

53:31.670 --> 53:34.590
The animal is walking along,
goes for the food and...

53:37.885 --> 53:38.886
Dead.

53:39.970 --> 53:42.598
Dinner.
But you have to cook it.

53:43.098 --> 53:44.975
I'm still working on the fire.

53:45.142 --> 53:47.060
Ahh. Well right now you gotta
help me get this up.

54:11.168 --> 54:12.252
Good.

54:21.678 --> 54:23.764
- Kit! He's out there, I saw him!
- Who?

54:24.640 --> 54:27.893
Sanders. He's tireing out for
someone to come find him.

54:28.060 --> 54:29.937
I think he's been lost out
her all this time.

54:30.062 --> 54:31.104
Whatta we do?

54:31.188 --> 54:33.482
We get his gun and
then we get rid of him.

54:33.607 --> 54:34.191
Moon!

54:34.316 --> 54:36.276
- What?
- We can't kill him. He's a police man.

54:36.568 --> 54:39.738
I ain't gonna kill him.
We're just gonna whip upon him some.

54:40.489 --> 54:44.618
Now, you go get some really long
thin sticks while I go gather some leaves.

55:13.313 --> 55:15.816
Whoa Hey!
Whoa whoa whoa!

55:16.900 --> 55:18.026
Hold on there little buddy.

55:18.569 --> 55:21.613
You best hand me that pistol
before you hurt yourself, ya hear?

55:22.030 --> 55:23.115
Huh?

55:30.414 --> 55:32.332
You're causing me a
lot of trouble, boy!

55:36.461 --> 55:38.463
That's a five hundred
dollar gun boy!

55:40.924 --> 55:42.009
If I catch you boy,
you're done!

55:46.054 --> 55:47.181
Get back here, boy!

55:51.393 --> 55:53.187
Get back here, boy!

56:00.861 --> 56:03.780
So...you finally
give up do ya?

56:03.989 --> 56:07.910
Yep. You're just too darn smart
for me Constable Sanders.

56:09.036 --> 56:11.121
Come on, arrest me.

56:11.205 --> 56:13.332
Ahh. I'll get around to it.

56:14.208 --> 56:17.252
First...you need a little ass whippin'.

56:19.671 --> 56:21.465
Yeah!

56:26.929 --> 56:28.972
Just wait till I
get out of this!

56:28.972 --> 56:31.391
By then we'll be miles away
and you'll be too busy

56:31.517 --> 56:32.851
itching and scratching
to chase anything.

56:33.602 --> 56:34.144
Huh?

56:34.770 --> 56:36.688
That's poison oak.

56:37.272 --> 56:39.358
Nearest way out of
these woods is

56:39.358 --> 56:41.443
that way. A highway
about 6 miles away.

56:41.485 --> 56:44.321
If you hurry, you can just about
make it before dark.

56:44.488 --> 56:46.365
You come back here.
You come back here, boy!

56:46.949 --> 56:48.659
Come on.

57:07.553 --> 57:09.471
<i>Kit was quick to learn
everything I taught him.</i>

57:13.851 --> 57:16.770
<i>It got to where I had to
show him less and less.</i>

57:26.154 --> 57:29.241
<i>With all the game we trapped,
we had plenty of food.</i>

57:30.284 --> 57:31.243
- This is so good
-  I know

57:35.706 --> 57:37.708
<i>I reminded him,
 that when spring came</i>

57:38.000 --> 57:40.294
<i>and the cold winter moved on,
we'd head to Alaska.</i>

57:50.345 --> 57:52.222
<i>The weather was warm
most days.</i>

57:53.265 --> 57:55.225
<i>I'm figured the worst part
of winter was over</i>

57:55.475 --> 57:57.519
<i>but I'm wrong.</i>

58:07.988 --> 58:10.908
Here, this will keep you warm.

58:21.460 --> 58:22.544
Thanks.

58:35.098 --> 58:38.143
I'm gonna go get you some
medicine. Hang in there, buddy.

59:06.338 --> 59:07.381
Here Kit.

59:09.466 --> 59:13.470
Eat this.
It will make you feel better.

59:15.639 --> 59:17.641
Hey, Kit.

59:22.938 --> 59:24.106
Thanks, Moon

59:34.491 --> 59:36.410
I do not want
you to die.

59:39.538 --> 59:42.666
- I'm okay
- You''re not.

59:49.006 --> 59:51.967
I'm gettin' you out
of here...tonight.

01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:19.680
We made it Kit.

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:21.723
We'll wait here for help.

01:01:22.474 --> 01:01:24.685
They'll come and take you
to get more medicine.

01:01:26.019 --> 01:01:27.980
I will be waiting out
here for you here, Kit.

01:01:31.275 --> 01:01:33.402
I'll bust in under
the new way.

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:42.703
What's happened  here, son?

01:01:43.912 --> 01:01:45.706
Get him his medicine.

01:02:02.598 --> 01:02:05.475
- Counts good. Mic check, 1,2,3,4.
- Sounds good.

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.770
Yesterday the boy they
call Alabama Moon

01:02:08.896 --> 01:02:10.856
brought one of its two other escapees
from the Pinson Boy's Home

01:02:11.023 --> 01:02:13.692
to this place
for medical attention.

01:02:14.067 --> 01:02:17.029
The sick boy is now being treated
at a Tuscaloosa hospital.

01:02:17.154 --> 01:02:20.657
It's belived that the  third escapee,
Hal Mitchell, is still at large

01:02:20.699 --> 01:02:22.701
with Alabama Moon in
the forest behind us.

01:02:23.368 --> 01:02:25.829
Moon Blake was wanted for
evasion of the law and,

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:28.540
attempt of murder of a police officer.

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.709
 This is Nancy Cynder,
Action 4 news.

01:02:31.168 --> 01:02:32.294
We're good.
That was perfect, Nancy.

01:02:35.881 --> 01:02:37.674
Yeah.
Sounded good.

01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:12.167
- What are you doing in there?
- Waiting  for Kit.

01:03:12.543 --> 01:03:15.879
- Come to live with me again?
- No, I got  my daddy with me.

01:03:19.758 --> 01:03:21.635
I ain't never seen
such a critter.

01:03:21.844 --> 01:03:24.763
Boy they're huntin' you all over.
Better get in here.

01:03:24.972 --> 01:03:26.974
But I told Kit
I'd wait for him.

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:28.976
Hell, you're gonna
have a long wait

01:03:29.226 --> 01:03:32.312
radio says they got'em in the hospital
stuck full of all kinds of stuff.

01:03:32.312 --> 01:03:35.148
It's okay, Moon, he's just
gotta get back on that medicine.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.359
I mean we came out here
to warn you about Sanders.

01:03:37.526 --> 01:03:39.194
He ain't lettin'
up on you.

01:03:39.486 --> 01:03:41.655
You need to find someplace
else to hang out for a while.

01:03:41.655 --> 01:03:43.490
I ain't afraid of Sanders.

01:03:43.532 --> 01:03:45.701
He's been on the radio saying that
you shot at him and ate his dog, Moon.

01:03:46.118 --> 01:03:47.953
- But I didn't do that.
- I know.

01:03:48.787 --> 01:03:51.915
I've been drawin' down of
my savin's trying to feed that bloodhound.

01:03:52.124 --> 01:03:54.293
Come on.

01:04:14.855 --> 01:04:15.898
Here it is Moon.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.025
Home Sweet Home.

01:04:18.233 --> 01:04:23.322
- Wow! This is great!
- Yeah, just like the Beverly Hillbillies.

01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:26.033
- This is where you live?
- Yeah.

01:04:26.033 --> 01:04:27.409
Whatta ya think of that Moon?

01:04:27.492 --> 01:04:28.785
Amazing!

01:04:28.869 --> 01:04:30.287
This is all yours?

01:04:30.287 --> 01:04:32.289
Me and the bank.

01:04:32.539 --> 01:04:33.665
Snapper!

01:04:42.132 --> 01:04:45.219
Show him around, Hal.

01:04:45.511 --> 01:04:47.179
Here it is.

01:04:47.179 --> 01:04:48.472
Wow!

01:04:49.306 --> 01:04:51.308
It's really nice!

01:04:52.559 --> 01:04:54.394
Let's get you cleaned up.

01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:04.029
- Hey, Moon, come on.
- Whatta ya doing?

01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:06.949
Get in. You ain't the
only one who knows about stuff.

01:05:14.498 --> 01:05:15.541
Faster!

01:05:18.544 --> 01:05:21.630
- Whatta ya think of this?
- Most fun I ever had!

01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:25.425
I gotta chain saw too.
Bet you've never used one of them.

01:05:25.592 --> 01:05:27.594
Let's go get it!

01:05:52.286 --> 01:05:53.954
Here you go, boy.

01:05:54.121 --> 01:05:57.082
Yeah, it's a touch easier than killin'
your own food, ain't it Moon?

01:05:57.291 --> 01:05:58.125
Yes, sir.

01:05:58.166 --> 01:06:00.419
I can ride around in clay
pits and use chain saws,

01:06:00.419 --> 01:06:03.338
and eat hamburgers, for a long
time before I get tired of  'em.

01:06:03.338 --> 01:06:05.132
Don't hurt yourself
on that burger boy.

01:06:05.424 --> 01:06:07.634
He always eats too much
when you give him regular food.

01:06:08.135 --> 01:06:10.262
You got anything I can
write a letter to Pap with?

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:11.513
I thought he was dead.

01:06:12.723 --> 01:06:13.473
He is

01:06:13.473 --> 01:06:15.976
but I write a letter, then burn it
so he can read the smoke.

01:06:16.393 --> 01:06:18.312
Moon, that's the dumbest thing
I ever heard of.

01:06:21.815 --> 01:06:23.317
You don't mind do ya?

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.320
You can do what ever
you want around here?

01:06:26.236 --> 01:06:27.404
There's writtin' stuff
in the kitchen drawer.

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:37.789
<i>Dear Pap</i>

01:06:39.249 --> 01:06:42.294
<i>I know it's been a long time
since I've written anything to you</i>

01:06:42.878 --> 01:06:46.131
<i>and sometimes, I wonder if you really
get these words in the smoke</i>

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.800
<i>seeing has how I
don't ever hear from you. </i>

01:06:49.343 --> 01:06:52.763
<i>and I've made some decisions that I
don't know that you'd really like.</i>

01:06:54.556 --> 01:06:58.143
<i>I've decided not to go to Alaska
at all if I've gotta be alone.</i>

01:06:59.603 --> 01:07:02.689
<i>I just don't think I can live up
there like you wanted me to live.</i>

01:07:02.814 --> 01:07:03.982
<i>I'd be too lonely, Pap.</i>

01:07:05.067 --> 01:07:07.819
<i>Why did we have to live up there
like we did Pap?</i>

01:07:08.153 --> 01:07:10.030
<i>Why couldn't I
have any friends?</i>

01:07:12.282 --> 01:07:13.367
<i>I just don't know what to do.</i>

01:07:15.327 --> 01:07:19.331
<i>I'm not mad at you.
 Love, Moon</i>

01:07:39.434 --> 01:07:40.727
Where's Snapper?

01:07:40.727 --> 01:07:43.564
He likes to sleep with my dad.

01:07:45.732 --> 01:07:47.860
What happened to Rachel?

01:07:48.193 --> 01:07:50.696
She only lives about
10 miles from here.

01:07:50.737 --> 01:07:52.906
When I drive over, she usually
sneaks out to meet me.

01:07:53.615 --> 01:07:56.326
We can go over there and see
her tomorrow if you want.

01:07:56.493 --> 01:07:57.494
That'd be nice.

01:07:57.578 --> 01:08:00.581
But first I want to
stop off and see Kit.

01:08:00.914 --> 01:08:03.000
I told you. We gotta
wait till he's better.

01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:06.170
Probably won't let anybody
in with him right now anyway.

01:08:07.171 --> 01:08:09.131
You know how he hates
those hospitals.

01:08:09.339 --> 01:08:11.425
Sure he hates dead a lot more.

01:08:14.928 --> 01:08:16.013
Hal?

01:08:16.555 --> 01:08:17.598
What Moon?

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:23.395
I think my Pap was wrong
about a lot of stuff.

01:08:23.812 --> 01:08:26.231
Wanting to live out there
in that forest?

01:08:26.231 --> 01:08:27.941
No, I like living in the forest.

01:08:27.983 --> 01:08:29.902
I don't know where
else I'd be.

01:08:31.111 --> 01:08:33.113
I just don't want
to be my myself.

01:08:33.363 --> 01:08:36.158
Me and Pap were always
by ourselves.

01:08:38.493 --> 01:08:40.495
- I'm a little tired.
- I'm not.

01:08:41.162 --> 01:08:42.872
I wanna try and see Kit.

01:08:42.872 --> 01:08:45.000
Can't it just wait
a couple of more days?

01:08:45.667 --> 01:08:47.920
-  I can't.
- I told you we gotta wait

01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:50.046
He doesn't like to be alone.

01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:52.841
- Please.
- Fine then.

01:08:54.968 --> 01:08:57.804
Well...better not get
my ass in to hell though.

01:08:58.138 --> 01:09:00.224
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:09:04.102 --> 01:09:05.979
Thanks for getting me out of Pinson.

01:09:06.772 --> 01:09:08.649
Goodnight.

01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:19.993
Don't stay there too long.

01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:22.621
People start asking questions,
get the hell out of there.

01:09:22.703 --> 01:09:25.499
I ain't stayin' around if
the cops start pouring in here.

01:09:25.374 --> 01:09:28.502
- I don't want you to.
- Good, cause I ain't.

01:09:40.805 --> 01:09:42.015
Be careful.

01:10:00.951 --> 01:10:03.537
- Umm...where's Kit?
- Who?

01:10:03.912 --> 01:10:05.873
The boy that was out in the forest.

01:10:05.998 --> 01:10:09.001
Oh, him. He's in the
 intensive care unit.

01:10:10.002 --> 01:10:12.087
And, how do I get in with him?

01:10:13.338 --> 01:10:15.757
That's not allowed here.
Just wait, right there.

01:10:18.385 --> 01:10:19.428
Wait, wait!

01:10:19.803 --> 01:10:21.221
Kit!

01:10:22.848 --> 01:10:24.975
Kit, it's me!

01:10:25.976 --> 01:10:27.811
It's me.

01:10:28.645 --> 01:10:30.480
I knew you'd
come for your little friend.

01:10:31.356 --> 01:10:32.357
Just let me see him,
I just want to talk to him.

01:10:32.357 --> 01:10:33.775
He doesn't like the hospitals.

01:10:34.067 --> 01:10:37.404
Oh, it don't matter anyway.
He's still out like a light.

01:10:40.407 --> 01:10:43.076
You seem to have
lost your spunk.

01:10:44.578 --> 01:10:46.663
You can't do anything
to me that matters.

01:10:48.457 --> 01:10:50.375
I don't got anywhere
to go anymore.

01:10:50.876 --> 01:10:52.794
Oh, you've got
somewhere to go.

01:10:53.879 --> 01:11:00.052
We're gonna have a whole
day of fun, you and me.

01:11:25.285 --> 01:11:26.703
Get out.

01:11:29.331 --> 01:11:30.332
This isn't Pinson.

01:11:30.499 --> 01:11:34.169
No...you're going to be beggin'
for Pinson by the time I'm done with ya.

01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:37.589
First, you're gonna show me
where you buried your daddy.

01:11:38.674 --> 01:11:42.177
Then, I'm gonna kick that smart
ass attitude out of your hide.

01:11:44.263 --> 01:11:45.556
What's going on here?

01:11:45.556 --> 01:11:47.057
Police matters.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.059
Requiring a dog leash?

01:11:49.476 --> 01:11:51.854
Listen Slick, this is
none of your b...

01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:54.648
This is your fault!

01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:56.692
Get the hell off
of my property.

01:11:56.733 --> 01:11:58.610
Now!

01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:54.875
What's your plan now?

01:12:56.084 --> 01:12:58.045
I've been thinking about it

01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:00.172
and if Sanders can't get to me,
he'll go after Kit.

01:13:02.257 --> 01:13:05.219
Did you do everything the
constable said you did?

01:13:05.469 --> 01:13:07.513
- No!
- I believe you.

01:13:08.388 --> 01:13:10.390
What I've seen of the constable,
he's a bully and a bigot.

01:13:10.682 --> 01:13:12.559
And a liar.

01:13:13.644 --> 01:13:17.314
Well you've damaged his pride, and he
doesn't take very well to that.

01:13:19.066 --> 01:13:24.071
Moon, I feel responsible for a
lot of what happened to you.

01:13:25.113 --> 01:13:29.284
I spent my whole life...
defending our legal system

01:13:30.327 --> 01:13:32.996
sometimes it just doesn't
work out very well.

01:13:34.122 --> 01:13:37.209
You needed...something else.

01:13:37.543 --> 01:13:39.753
You could've let me stay, and
live out there in your woods.

01:13:39.837 --> 01:13:41.672
All by yourself?

01:13:45.259 --> 01:13:48.595
Moon...I'm gonna try
and help you.

01:13:50.138 --> 01:13:51.890
I'm gonna get this map

01:13:52.975 --> 01:13:56.019
and you're going to show
me where everything happened

01:13:56.562 --> 01:13:58.397
right from the beginning.

01:14:00.524 --> 01:14:03.652
Alright now,
we are...

01:14:03.652 --> 01:14:05.362
here.

01:14:06.113 --> 01:14:07.739
Yeah , yeah. I remember
going up this trail.

01:14:07.739 --> 01:14:09.575
- Do you remember this highway?
- Yeah, I passed that...

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.997
We're going to Tuscaloosa.

01:14:15.247 --> 01:14:18.166
The judge there said he'd
be willing to hold you in his jail...

01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:20.335
while I try and make a
a case for you.

01:14:21.044 --> 01:14:22.087
Okay.

01:14:28.677 --> 01:14:31.013
And you'll be safe from Sanders.

01:14:31.305 --> 01:14:32.639
What if...?

01:14:42.274 --> 01:14:44.318
- What about Kit?
- Let's worry about you first

01:14:44.401 --> 01:14:46.403
Kit's safe where he is.

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.066
What'ya think you're doing?

01:15:25.108 --> 01:15:27.069
That boy is supposed to
be in my custody.

01:15:27.236 --> 01:15:29.571
We've already discussed that
over the phone Constable...

01:15:29.905 --> 01:15:31.573
I don't care what we
discussed on the phone...

01:15:31.657 --> 01:15:33.784
- Get your hands down.
- Hey, don't touch me.

01:15:33.867 --> 01:15:35.744
Hey, get your hands
off me.

01:15:36.328 --> 01:15:37.663
Did you talk with
Mr. Wellington yet?

01:15:37.704 --> 01:15:41.667
- I'm not a news service, kid.
- But I've been here two days!

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.762
Hey, kid.
Come on.

01:15:54.638 --> 01:15:56.515
Mr. Wellington sent
these over

01:15:56.348 --> 01:15:58.267
you put them on,
and we'll go.

01:16:14.783 --> 01:16:15.951
Moon, get out,
come talk to us.

01:16:24.459 --> 01:16:26.044
How are you felling?

01:16:27.421 --> 01:16:29.631
Do you have a lawyer?

01:16:32.759 --> 01:16:33.844
Are you scared?

01:16:40.601 --> 01:16:42.477
Go in there and sit
with your lawyer, son.

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.444
- I thought you'd left me.
- Quiet!

01:16:51.528 --> 01:16:53.697
You don't speak unless you're
given permission, you hear?

01:16:53.864 --> 01:16:55.282
Yes sir.

01:16:55.365 --> 01:16:58.160
Now, we've got an unusual situation here.

01:16:58.869 --> 01:17:00.954
and because of that,
I've closed this hearing to the public.

01:17:01.079 --> 01:17:02.956
And I got a headache

01:17:03.081 --> 01:17:05.250
and those people out there
are driving me crazy.

01:17:06.168 --> 01:17:10.380
Moon Blake, you have stirred up
quite a commotion here...

01:17:10.547 --> 01:17:12.424
and I don't like the commotion.

01:17:12.549 --> 01:17:15.302
and I don't like people who shoot
at our law enforement officers

01:17:15.594 --> 01:17:17.554
and I don't like people who eat
other people's dogs.

01:17:17.846 --> 01:17:19.306
Sanders is a liar!

01:17:19.306 --> 01:17:21.433
Hey! Did I ask you a question?

01:17:23.477 --> 01:17:24.561
No.

01:17:24.895 --> 01:17:27.105
Okay then, let's get started.
Come on up here, Constable Sanders.

01:17:36.573 --> 01:17:38.534
- You're not gonna lie are ya?
- No Your Honor.

01:17:39.576 --> 01:17:41.912
Alright. Go on then, let's
hear your side.

01:17:42.621 --> 01:17:45.916
Well, I sent my trackin' dog
after the boy

01:17:47.459 --> 01:17:49.294
He caught the dog and
must of ate it.

01:17:50.045 --> 01:17:52.798
When I caught up to him,
he shot at me.

01:17:53.131 --> 01:17:55.175
Shot at you with what?

01:17:55.801 --> 01:17:57.177
A pistol.

01:17:57.719 --> 01:17:59.263
Where'd he get it?

01:17:59.304 --> 01:18:00.430
He stole it from me.

01:18:03.517 --> 01:18:05.018
He stole it from you?

01:18:05.018 --> 01:18:06.812
I took it. I threw
it in the lake

01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:08.605
I never shot at you!

01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:11.859
Well, the kid admits he
took your gun away from you.

01:18:12.067 --> 01:18:13.861
How in the heck
did that happen?

01:18:16.029 --> 01:18:18.156
- I dropped it.
- You're a liar!

01:18:18.198 --> 01:18:20.284
I snuck up on you
and I took it.

01:18:20.284 --> 01:18:23.412
Hey! You want me to gag you boy?
Hush.

01:18:26.373 --> 01:18:27.833
Okay. That all?

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:29.543
Ain't that enough?

01:18:29.585 --> 01:18:31.253
Get up here, Wellington.

01:18:36.592 --> 01:18:37.885
Good morning Constable.

01:18:37.968 --> 01:18:39.386
Morning Slick.

01:18:42.472 --> 01:18:45.642
Contable Sanders, how many
times did the boy fire at you?

01:18:46.268 --> 01:18:50.022
Oh, at least 4 or 5 times.
I'm lucky to be alive.

01:18:54.651 --> 01:18:56.153
I didn't shoot at him.

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:06.330
Constable Sanders, is this
your service revolver?

01:19:10.209 --> 01:19:12.711
Well, it looks sorta similar.

01:19:13.337 --> 01:19:16.507
The serial number matches
the county record.

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:22.429
This is your gun. I had it retrieved from
the pond where the boy said he through it.

01:19:23.013 --> 01:19:26.850
Notice You Honor, the gun
still contains six rounds.

01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:29.937
This gun has not been fired.

01:19:30.145 --> 01:19:31.980
How do you explain
that Constable?

01:19:32.272 --> 01:19:34.274
Yeah Constable.
How do you explain that?

01:19:36.401 --> 01:19:37.319
Well, I...

01:19:37.444 --> 01:19:39.488
Constable Sanders, how long have
you been a law enforcement officer?

01:19:41.156 --> 01:19:42.449
Fifteen years.

01:19:42.533 --> 01:19:45.244
And never had any employment or
part-time work outside the profession?

01:19:46.912 --> 01:19:47.412
No.

01:19:47.454 --> 01:19:49.915
In fact, if a constable were to
accept money for favors

01:19:49.957 --> 01:19:52.626
that would be considered
accepting a bribe, would't it?

01:19:55.045 --> 01:19:57.130
Hey, wha wha what are you
trying to pull here?

01:19:57.172 --> 01:20:01.009
So you've never done any work,
or favors, for the Pinson Boys Home?

01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:04.096
Not that I recall.

01:20:04.179 --> 01:20:07.140
Then why, would the Pinson
Boys Home have any entry

01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:10.352
to you in the cash log
for $500

01:20:10.811 --> 01:20:12.980
on the very same day
of the escape?

01:20:18.151 --> 01:20:21.154
Me and the director
are gamblin' buddies.

01:20:21.238 --> 01:20:25.492
Constable, you better hope this
ain't going were I think it's going.

01:20:27.536 --> 01:20:29.580
Your Honor, I would like to
introduce some witnesses.

01:20:31.456 --> 01:20:33.375
Yeah. Bring'em on in.

01:20:39.548 --> 01:20:41.592
- Hal!
- Hey Moon.

01:20:41.592 --> 01:20:43.010
Hey Rachel.

01:20:43.844 --> 01:20:46.847
Your Honor, I would like to introduce
Mr. Mitchell, his son Hal,

01:20:47.222 --> 01:20:49.308
Rachel Gene, and Snapper.

01:20:49.516 --> 01:20:51.059
Constable Sander's dog.

01:20:51.226 --> 01:20:53.020
That's a damn lie!

01:20:53.437 --> 01:20:55.856
No, that's your dead dog.

01:20:55.981 --> 01:20:57.274
Slick.

01:20:58.358 --> 01:21:00.402
Sit back down Constable.

01:21:05.949 --> 01:21:07.201
What's wrong with you?

01:21:07.201 --> 01:21:10.037
Why would a grown man
act like this over a kid?

01:21:10.662 --> 01:21:12.456
Not only have you lied to me

01:21:12.497 --> 01:21:15.334
it seems mighty suspicious
that you've accepted a payoff.

01:21:16.502 --> 01:21:19.463
He did! He got Daddy to
pay him to go after Moon.

01:21:19.630 --> 01:21:21.673
I got the cash log for Mr. Wellington

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.929
Bailiff, put this red neck
hick in my jail?

01:21:27.304 --> 01:21:30.015
And call the Livingston PD and
tell them he's been reassigned

01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:33.227
- to the state penitentiary.
- You can't run a trial like this.

01:21:33.727 --> 01:21:36.522
- I just did.
- Get your hands off me!

01:21:39.441 --> 01:21:41.360
I told you he was a liar!

01:21:45.781 --> 01:21:48.659
Hal Mitchell,
am I lookin' for you?

01:21:48.825 --> 01:21:49.826
Yes sir.

01:21:49.993 --> 01:21:54.915
I guess you realize this is your last stop
before Helen Wyler?

01:21:57.251 --> 01:21:59.086
Sir, I know.

01:22:01.505 --> 01:22:03.090
Kid, what am I'm gonna
 to do with you?

01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:04.383
Your Honor,

01:22:04.383 --> 01:22:07.469
ironically, all the publicity
surrounding the case

01:22:07.719 --> 01:22:10.764
has brought about an unexpected
bit of good fortune.

01:22:11.682 --> 01:22:15.102
Relatives have heard of the boy's
flight and have come forward

01:22:15.978 --> 01:22:19.398
I spoke to the boy's
uncle this morning.\

01:22:20.023 --> 01:22:22.192
and he is eager
 to adopt Moon.

01:22:23.193 --> 01:22:24.278
Uncle?

01:22:24.319 --> 01:22:28.240
Well, where's the uncle been, while
this kid has been raising cane all over Alabama?

01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:30.367
They live in Mobile Your Honor.

01:22:30.576 --> 01:22:33.996
The family has been searching for
the boy and his father for years.

01:22:34.621 --> 01:22:37.124
They are very thankful that
Moon has been found.

01:22:38.834 --> 01:22:41.962
Seems like a nice man,
and a very nice family.

01:22:45.174 --> 01:22:48.427
Moon!
Behave yourself.

01:22:50.387 --> 01:22:52.306
It's great, Moon.

01:22:52.389 --> 01:22:54.516
I ought to woop you good
for doing what you did today

01:22:54.975 --> 01:22:56.059
They were gonna find me anyway.

01:22:56.685 --> 01:22:58.645
Well Moon,
I am proud of my boy.

01:22:58.854 --> 01:23:01.815
- He done the right thing.
- Let's go, Hal.

01:23:02.816 --> 01:23:04.818
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, son.

01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:07.070
- Bye, Hal.
- See ya, Moon

01:23:08.113 --> 01:23:10.032
He's a damn good boy.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:13.952
Well, Moon, you call if 
you need anything.

01:23:14.203 --> 01:23:16.997
um...I've gotta go too, Moon.
My mom's waiting outside.

01:23:17.414 --> 01:23:19.333
Will call me on the tellephone
when you get to Mobile?

01:23:19.499 --> 01:23:21.627
- Bye Rachel.
- Bye.

01:23:24.463 --> 01:23:26.924
Can we go see Kit now?

01:23:47.736 --> 01:23:48.820
Can you help me with a patient?

01:23:49.696 --> 01:23:52.491
A young boy about his age.
His name is Kit.

01:25:43.435 --> 01:25:46.480
I was afraid you might have
gone back to your old ways again.

01:25:49.608 --> 01:25:51.652
- Hey, I need some stuff to write with.
- Yeah.

01:25:56.949 --> 01:25:58.992
- Will this do?
- Yeah.

01:26:02.246 --> 01:26:04.122
Sure you don't want
to come inside?

01:26:05.457 --> 01:26:08.085
- No, I'm okay.
- Okay. I understand.

01:26:08.418 --> 01:26:10.921
I'll leave the light on
if you change your mind.

01:26:27.729 --> 01:26:31.650
<i>I started in telling Kit all the
things I had planned for us.</i>

01:26:31.942 --> 01:26:34.862
<i>All those things we never 
got the chance to do together.</i>

01:26:36.029 --> 01:26:38.991
<i>Fish we never caught, traps
I never showed him how to make</i>

01:26:39.199 --> 01:26:40.409
<i>the places we never saw.</i>

01:26:41.285 --> 01:26:44.454
<i>And all the things we missed
out on doing together.</i>

01:26:44.454 --> 01:26:47.332
<i>I guessed Kit would
want to know these things.</i>

01:26:47.583 --> 01:26:50.586
<i>So I told him how
much I missed him.</i>

01:26:50.752 --> 01:26:52.754
<i>and how I'd always
think of him.</i>

01:26:52.963 --> 01:26:54.882
<i>as my best friend.</i>

01:27:06.768 --> 01:27:08.645
I'm sorry, Moon.

01:27:09.646 --> 01:27:11.732
I'm so sorry.

01:27:13.192 --> 01:27:15.402
Kit's all alone up there now.

01:27:15.986 --> 01:27:17.654
I know.

01:27:17.654 --> 01:27:20.908
And Moon...
it's not your fault.

01:27:21.325 --> 01:27:23.076
The doctors told me.

01:27:24.161 --> 01:27:25.329
Your friend was very sick.

01:27:26.538 --> 01:27:28.498
He wasn't ever
going to get well.

01:27:31.001 --> 01:27:34.004
The nurses told me, all
Kit could talk about

01:27:34.213 --> 01:27:36.215
was his adventures 
out there in the woods

01:27:37.299 --> 01:27:39.218
the weeks he spent with you.

01:27:40.427 --> 01:27:43.514
He had the best time in his
whole life, out there with you.

01:27:55.150 --> 01:27:56.902
I miss him though.

01:27:57.277 --> 01:28:00.531
- I miss him so much.
- I know.

01:28:02.533 --> 01:28:05.285
And it's okay
that you do.

01:28:38.735 --> 01:28:39.820
Hey Moon.
I'm your uncle Mike.

01:28:40.821 --> 01:28:43.031
Hey.
I don't remember you.

01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:46.910
Well, we've been
lookin' for you.

01:28:47.119 --> 01:28:49.079
And it's taken a long time,
and I'm sorry about that.

01:28:51.206 --> 01:28:54.543
- You ain't mad about this?
- No, I'm not mad.

01:28:56.461 --> 01:28:58.463
You got a whole bunch
of family down in Mobile

01:28:58.714 --> 01:29:00.591
all excited to see you.

01:29:08.432 --> 01:29:10.475
Thank you for all you've
done, Mr. Wellington.

01:29:11.435 --> 01:29:13.353
Pap was wrong about you.

01:29:14.605 --> 01:29:15.772
You are a good person.

01:29:15.772 --> 01:29:18.650
Well there are a lot of
good people out there Moon.

01:29:18.734 --> 01:29:21.236
I'm sure you'll find
that out for yourself.

01:29:23.989 --> 01:29:25.991
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:29:36.502 --> 01:29:39.546
Bye, Mr. Wellington.
Come and visit us.

01:29:40.506 --> 01:29:42.549
Yeah, I get down
that way.

01:30:10.744 --> 01:30:12.871
Well I guess you're
my new Pap, right?

01:30:15.999 --> 01:30:17.125
I could never replace your Pap...

01:30:17.626 --> 01:30:21.296
but... I would like for you to
think of me that way, yeah.

01:30:24.341 --> 01:30:26.593
So you came and looked for us?

01:30:26.593 --> 01:30:28.470
Yeah, we went lookin' for ya.

01:30:30.806 --> 01:30:33.809
Your dad just...
he kinda disappeared.

01:30:34.184 --> 01:30:36.436
He didn't leave a trace 
of where he was going.

01:30:38.021 --> 01:30:39.940
Why did he make me live
out there like that?

01:30:41.024 --> 01:30:42.150
Why couldn't I 
have any friends?

01:30:44.152 --> 01:30:46.071
Well...

01:30:46.363 --> 01:30:50.284
you hit me with all the
hard ones right up front, huh?

01:30:50.617 --> 01:30:55.455
Moon, your dad...
just kinda did his own thing

01:30:55.747 --> 01:30:58.959
and went his own way
and he didn't trust most people.

01:30:59.835 --> 01:31:02.838
I think when your mom died,
he took it pretty hard.

01:31:05.048 --> 01:31:09.011
- I lost a good friend too.
- Yeah, I heard about that.

01:31:09.303 --> 01:31:11.180
I'm Sorry.

01:31:17.477 --> 01:31:20.105
You know, Moon? 
The important thing...

01:31:21.648 --> 01:31:24.693
is that, you don't have to
feel like he did.

01:31:26.904 --> 01:31:28.071
Most people don't.

01:32:07.653 --> 01:32:09.821
Moon, this is your Aunt Sarah.

01:32:22.376 --> 01:32:24.294
- And this is Alice.
- Hi.

01:32:25.295 --> 01:32:26.338
And this is David.

01:32:26.505 --> 01:32:28.340
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:32:29.925 --> 01:32:32.636
Alice, tell him about
your mean hot chocolate.

01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.348
Come on.

01:33:59.306 --> 01:34:03.352
- Hey buddy, you okay?
- Yeah.

01:34:08.524 --> 01:34:11.610
I was just going to write
a smoke letter to Kit and Pap

01:34:12.694 --> 01:34:15.864
telling them where I was, and
how nice things are here.

01:34:17.908 --> 01:34:23.080
But...I don't believe that smoke
letters really work anymore.

01:34:25.832 --> 01:34:29.253
I bet they know.
Don't you think?

01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:32.381
I bet they know.

01:34:32.422 --> 01:34:36.718
You know Moon. We don't expect you
to just slide into everything here.

01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:39.805
It's a lot to get used to.

01:34:40.389 --> 01:34:42.599
especially coming from a background
as different as yours.

01:34:45.185 --> 01:34:49.648
We'll just take it slow. I just know
everything's gonna be fine.

01:34:51.441 --> 01:34:53.443
- Right?
- OK.

01:35:03.954 --> 01:35:07.833
- Can I make hot chocolate?
- You bet you can. It's cold out here.
