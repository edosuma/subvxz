WEBVTT

00:03.204 --> 00:05.170
I lost my faith.

00:06.874 --> 00:09.675
Look! It's a gigantic ship
in Korea!

00:09.677 --> 00:11.477
Like the ark.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.445
We must get to the ark
before the floods begin,

00:13.447 --> 00:15.948
because I am the new Noah.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.019
(chittering)
Okay, here's the animals.

00:20.021 --> 00:21.186
(electricity buzzing,
people screaming)

00:21.188 --> 00:23.489
(explosion, glass shatters)

00:23.491 --> 00:24.757
Start the damn boat!

00:27.695 --> 00:30.229
Thank you, Lord. You saved us!

00:30.231 --> 00:33.332
I'll never question you again!

00:33.334 --> 00:35.234
(thunder crashes)

00:35.236 --> 00:36.835
Why me, Lord?!

00:36.837 --> 00:38.737
Why me?!

00:38.739 --> 00:40.672
(thunder crashes)
What good is faith

00:40.674 --> 00:42.174
when God treats you like this?!

00:42.176 --> 00:44.810
Why me, Lord?!

00:44.812 --> 00:46.979
You speak every language!

00:46.981 --> 00:49.381
Why are you talking to me
in thunder?

00:49.383 --> 00:50.916
(thunder crashes)

00:50.918 --> 00:52.217
Why me?!

00:52.219 --> 00:53.752
Stan?
Can't sleep?

00:53.754 --> 00:56.722
Well, you're screaming at God
and kicking me.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.991
Are you starting to worry
that we're floating

00:58.993 --> 01:02.394
on a giant time bomb
filled with natural gas?

01:02.396 --> 01:03.729
Oh, yeah, I'm really scared

01:03.731 --> 01:05.364
about being on a boat
full of farts.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.699
Well,
since we're both up...

01:07.701 --> 01:10.202
(thud)
The flood really happened,
Francine.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.371
We're the only people
left in the world.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.273
Did everyone else
deserve to drown?

01:14.275 --> 01:16.341
Grumpy cat, the Muppets?

01:16.343 --> 01:19.178
You're telling me Daniel Tosh
has to die, but<i> I</i> get to live?!

01:19.180 --> 01:21.413
So, are we doing it?

01:21.415 --> 01:24.416
Or did I shave my legs with
a tuna can lid for nothing?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.951
I'm sorry, I...
I can't.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.519
Why not?

01:27.521 --> 01:29.555
You used to complain that
you couldn't get in the mood

01:29.557 --> 01:31.423
because of the hustle and bustle
of the modern world.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.192
Now what is it?

01:33.194 --> 01:35.861
Hey, it's not like you've been
popping boners everywhere!

01:35.863 --> 01:38.063
How can you even think of sex
at a time like this?

01:38.065 --> 01:40.466
It's easy.
We're having sex right now.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.067
Uh, are we?

01:42.069 --> 01:44.303
Would everybody shut up?!
You guys got it good.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.438
I don't even had someone
to sex it to.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.774
The only women around here
are my mom and sister.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.977
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.812
(laughter)

01:53.814 --> 01:57.382
(laughs)
You said it, Stan.

01:57.384 --> 01:59.885
(patriotic music plays)

01:59.887 --> 02:03.122
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:03.124 --> 02:06.492
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

02:06.494 --> 02:09.828
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

02:09.830 --> 02:13.866
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

02:15.736 --> 02:19.071
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

02:19.073 --> 02:21.340
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:21.342 --> 02:22.674
Aah!

02:23.911 --> 02:27.346
¶<i> Good morning, U.S.A.</i> ¶

02:27.348 --> 02:30.015
(thunder crashes)

02:30.017 --> 02:31.483
This boat is hell!

02:31.485 --> 02:32.985
I wish I died in the flood!

02:32.987 --> 02:35.621
Steve, obviously,
we all wish we were dead.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.755
What is everyone
complaining about?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.590
This boat is the best!

02:38.592 --> 02:40.826
Don't you think all your friends
would love to be here with you?

02:40.828 --> 02:41.994
(up-tempo music starts)

02:41.996 --> 02:43.829
¶ If they could see you now ¶

02:43.831 --> 02:45.831
¶ And all this fun
that you've found ¶

02:45.833 --> 02:47.432
¶ But they surely can't ¶

02:47.434 --> 02:49.535
¶ Because they've all drowned ¶

02:49.537 --> 02:52.971
¶ Mostly corpses
on the ocean bed ¶

02:52.973 --> 02:54.773
¶ They'd die of jealousy ¶

02:54.775 --> 02:57.109
¶ But they're already dead ¶

02:57.111 --> 03:00.679
¶ But if they could ¶

03:00.681 --> 03:04.049
¶ See you now
out on this party boat cruise ¶

03:04.051 --> 03:07.152
¶ Living the life
and huffing diesel fumes ¶

03:07.154 --> 03:09.821
¶ The only thing
that we have to do ¶

03:09.823 --> 03:13.458
¶ Is watch the temperature gauge
and make it stay in the blue ¶

03:13.460 --> 03:15.861
(laughing)

03:15.863 --> 03:17.796
¶ Check out this petting zoo.
Wow! ¶

03:17.798 --> 03:19.565
¶ And this one's
all you can eat ¶

03:19.567 --> 03:21.700
¶ Ever had giraffe soup. Pow! ¶

03:21.702 --> 03:23.202
¶ You're in for a treat ¶

03:23.204 --> 03:25.871
¶ What a fun ship, holy cow ¶

03:25.873 --> 03:30.609
¶ When you have to poop,
be sure you do it over the bow ¶

03:32.379 --> 03:33.645
¶ Climbing walls ¶

03:33.647 --> 03:35.747
¶ There's just so much to do ¶

03:35.749 --> 03:37.149
¶ And free blankets ¶

03:37.151 --> 03:39.318
¶ Wait, that's a dead kangaroo ¶

03:39.320 --> 03:42.854
¶ This boat's the cat's meow.
Meow! ¶

03:42.856 --> 03:49.728
¶ If your friends
could see you now ¶

03:49.730 --> 03:51.096
Jeff, what are you doing here?

03:51.098 --> 03:52.564
Who's watching
the temperature gauge?!

04:01.575 --> 04:03.242
(screaming)
(explosion)

04:03.244 --> 04:07.379
Stan, you remembered to tie down
those loose barrels, right?

04:07.381 --> 04:10.215
I think we have
bigger things to worry about.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.717
Francine!

04:11.719 --> 04:15.420
I forget to secure
one measly barrel, and my --

04:25.232 --> 04:29.034
Roger, find the others
and get in the life boat!

04:30.571 --> 04:32.871
I don't see anyone!

04:37.144 --> 04:39.945
You know, it's too bad the rest
of the family couldn't be saved,

04:39.947 --> 04:42.581
but I am not hating
this leg room right now.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.317
Quick, grab any supplies
you can!

04:45.319 --> 04:47.986
I got some water
and a box of canned food.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.455
Check it out!
I got a Keurig...

04:50.457 --> 04:51.957
And a wolf!

04:51.959 --> 04:53.125
(snarls)

04:55.496 --> 04:57.229
(screaming)

05:00.668 --> 05:02.501
This is my fault!
I'm a screw-up!

05:02.503 --> 05:04.102
Hey, help me up.

05:04.104 --> 05:07.172
Oh, man! Look at this.
I'm screwing up right now.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.740
I'm not helping you
at all!

05:08.742 --> 05:10.275
Well,
I need your help now!

05:10.277 --> 05:12.644
Unbelievable,
I'm doing it again!

05:12.646 --> 05:15.847
I'm the worst husband ever.
I don't deserve you.

05:15.849 --> 05:19.251
Just let me go.
You're better off without me.

05:19.253 --> 05:21.820
(grunting)

05:25.926 --> 05:29.094
(flute music playing)

05:32.766 --> 05:38.704
<i> A woman cast adrift, washes</i>
<i> ashore on an island paradise.</i>

05:38.706 --> 05:44.142
<i> Her mind blown clean</i>
<i> by tropical island breezes.</i>

05:44.144 --> 05:47.012
<i> Or maybe it was</i>
<i> her massive concussion.</i>

05:47.014 --> 05:49.181
<i> The point is,</i>
<i> her mind has been erased</i>

05:49.183 --> 05:52.984
<i> and now she is as innocent</i>
<i> as a child...</i>

05:52.986 --> 05:55.153
<i> who might have brain damage.</i>

05:55.155 --> 05:57.155
<i> But enough doctor talk.</i>

05:57.157 --> 06:00.859
<i> Just listen</i>
<i> to the wonderful flute music.</i>

06:00.861 --> 06:03.562
(flute music continues)

06:03.564 --> 06:06.131
<i> But she is not alone.</i>

06:06.133 --> 06:09.434
<i> A man...</i>

06:13.374 --> 06:17.909
<i> His mind also dulled</i>
<i> to a childlike state.</i>

06:17.911 --> 06:22.147
<i> Two that used to be so close</i>
<i> now made strangers</i>

06:22.149 --> 06:26.852
<i> by tropical breezes</i>
<i> and/or definitely head wounds.</i>

06:26.854 --> 06:30.722
<i> Will they rediscover</i>
<i> their lost romance?</i>

06:30.724 --> 06:33.525
<i> Or will they eat each other?</i>

06:33.527 --> 06:40.132
<i> For those are the two paths</i>
<i> of Flute Island!</i>

06:43.237 --> 06:44.836
(flute music plays)

06:44.838 --> 06:47.706
<i> Before man and woman</i>
<i> can learn to love,</i>

06:47.708 --> 06:51.109
<i> they must learn to survive.</i>

06:51.111 --> 06:55.213
<i> Spear fishing takes patience,</i>
<i> focus, and cunning.</i>

06:55.215 --> 07:00.919
<i> For to draw your food</i>

07:00.921 --> 07:02.754
<i> Oh, he's already got one.</i>

07:02.756 --> 07:06.758
<i> But his amateur thrashing</i>
<i>has alerted his remaining prey.</i>

07:06.760 --> 07:09.227
<i> There will be no second fish.</i>

07:09.229 --> 07:11.463
<i> Oh, man!</i>

07:11.465 --> 07:14.366
<i> He is gonna get so sick</i>
<i> of fish.</i>

07:14.368 --> 07:17.135
<i>But nature strives for balance.</i>

07:17.137 --> 07:20.605
<i> On one side of the island</i>
<i> is unearned abundance.</i>

07:20.607 --> 07:23.608
<i> On the other, a scarcity.</i>

07:23.610 --> 07:25.944
(panting)

07:25.946 --> 07:31.416
<i> If she cannot produce fire by</i>

07:31.418 --> 07:33.385
<i> how in the...?</i>

07:33.387 --> 07:36.054
<i> As predicted.</i>

07:37.991 --> 07:39.891
Why the hell
did you bore holes

07:39.893 --> 07:41.960
into the crate
we were floating on?!

07:41.962 --> 07:44.930
They were speed holes to help us
float to safety faster.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.265
The only thing
we're gonna do faster is die.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.733
I know it was a mistake,

07:48.735 --> 07:51.403
and that's why I'm vowing
to make a change, babe.

07:51.405 --> 07:54.139
For the next 30 to 40 minutes
before we drown,

07:54.141 --> 07:56.408
you're gonna see
a brand-new Jeff.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.109
First, no more red meat.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.312
Second,
I'm gonna exercise more.

08:00.314 --> 08:03.815
Third, I'm gonna taper off
smoking weed until it's just

08:03.817 --> 08:07.118
a little puff before
a silly movie or something --

08:07.120 --> 08:08.954
(louder) unless I have
a friend visiting,

08:08.956 --> 08:10.956
then I can smoke
as much as I want,

08:10.958 --> 08:12.858
'cause that's being
a good host.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.494
Jeff, do you know
why you're shouting?

08:15.496 --> 08:18.096
'Cause of
that damn helicopter!

08:18.098 --> 08:19.764
(wolf snarling)

08:19.766 --> 08:22.100
I feel like
you're in a bad mood, Steve.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.769
Is this still about the wolf
eating all the food rations?

08:24.771 --> 08:26.505
He can't help himself.
He's a wolf.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.839
I know he's a wolf!

08:27.841 --> 08:29.875
Why would you bring him
on to the boat?!

08:29.877 --> 08:31.343
The wolf is great.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.278
(snarls)

08:33.280 --> 08:35.814
No way we're getting
robbed with this guy aboard.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.148
You're the worst!

08:37.150 --> 08:39.217
You're unhelpful,
you're unreliable,

08:39.219 --> 08:40.452
and you're the last person

08:40.454 --> 08:42.854
I would want
to share a lifeboat with!

08:42.856 --> 08:45.023
I can't believe
you feel this way.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.827
(sighs) Well, then...

08:48.829 --> 08:50.962
Goodbye, Steve.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.701
You want someone helpful at sea,
then I'm your man.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.237
The name's Buck Wett-Nap,
survivalist.

08:59.239 --> 09:03.074
Okay.
I once survived four days
in a Del Taco parking lot,

09:03.076 --> 09:06.511
extracting life-saving nutrients
from puddles and bird shit.

09:06.513 --> 09:10.715
Why didn't you just go into
the Del Taco?

09:10.717 --> 09:13.151
I'm a Taco Bell man.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.087
<i> As beautiful</i>
<i> as this paradise is,</i>

09:16.089 --> 09:17.889
<i> it is equally treacherous.</i>

09:17.891 --> 09:19.124
Aaah!

09:20.227 --> 09:22.260
(hisses)

09:23.530 --> 09:25.363
Aaah!

09:25.365 --> 09:29.000
<i> She admires his muscles,</i>
<i> his strong features,</i>

09:29.002 --> 09:32.671
<i> and the way sweat collects</i>
<i> under this nipples.</i>

09:32.673 --> 09:35.273
<i> Mmm!</i>
<i> That's nice, too.</i>

09:39.112 --> 09:41.246
<i> As with Adam and Eve,</i>

09:41.248 --> 09:45.250
<i> so the serpent</i>
<i> sparks the sexuality.</i>

09:47.688 --> 09:50.322
<i> Well, now there's</i>
<i> barf on the beach.</i>

09:59.299 --> 10:01.132
So, the world didn't end.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.634
Well, then I'm gonna
need your help

10:02.636 --> 10:04.235
finding my family
so that I can kill my father.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.737
(chuckles)

10:05.739 --> 10:08.306
That's a story I'd like to hear,
but we're very busy.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.908
This is the U.S. Navy.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.777
Everybody on this ship
has a clear job to do --

10:12.779 --> 10:14.079
and a purpose.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.080
Whoa.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.748
Whoa, indeed.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.250
Mr. Captain, I'm tired
of being a screw-up.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.585
I'd like to join your Navy.

10:20.587 --> 10:21.419
What?!

10:21.421 --> 10:22.954
(chuckles)

10:22.956 --> 10:25.957
The Navy isn't something
you can just ask to join.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.326
You also have to
sign this form.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.230
Welcome to the Navy.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.933
Our deal is
we're in charge of the ocean.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.669
Oh, and we have our own
special color blue.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.505
It's so dark it's nuts,
you won't believe it --

10:40.507 --> 10:42.140
almost a black.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.842
This concludes
your training.

10:43.844 --> 10:47.545
(ominous music plays)

10:54.521 --> 10:57.689
Check it out, Steve, it's like
peeling an orange in one piece.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.091
(snarls)
(screaming)

11:03.263 --> 11:05.997
I thought you were supposed to
be some sort of survivalist.

11:05.999 --> 11:09.267
I am. And not one of those
fake survivalists on TV.

11:09.269 --> 11:12.003
I have a web series...
idea.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.706
Why don't I use our supplies
here and catch us some fish.

11:14.708 --> 11:18.176
That would be amazing!

11:18.178 --> 11:20.145
And now all we have to do
is wait.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.647
I like to pass the time
in survival situations

11:22.649 --> 11:24.215
by playing Candy Crush.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.517
You have a phone?!

11:25.519 --> 11:26.518
Of course!

11:26.520 --> 11:28.119
A lot of people don't realize

11:28.121 --> 11:30.955
that boredom is the greatest
danger when lost at sea.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.457
Have you tried
calling anyone?

11:32.459 --> 11:33.825
I keep it on
airplane mode.

11:33.827 --> 11:37.162
That's a survival tip
for your battery.

11:37.164 --> 11:40.031
Hmm. Would you mind if we waited
till the next billing cycle?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.666
I only get
four minutes a month.

11:41.668 --> 11:42.801
It's a plan for seniors.

11:42.803 --> 11:43.802
Just call someone!

11:43.804 --> 11:45.170
You're right, you're right.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.671
Should I call Klaus
or my friend Tiffany?

11:46.673 --> 11:49.207
Tiffany isn't speaking to me,
might not pick up.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.076
Klaus!

11:51.078 --> 11:53.244
(beep)

11:53.246 --> 11:56.314
Oh, yeah,
I'm alive -- barely, man.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.517
My 20-hour flight from Korea
didn't serve a single meal.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.820
So, I guess there wasn't
a biblical catastrophe.

12:01.822 --> 12:06.224
Well, not until Delta gets my
harshly worded complaint letter.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.060
Heads are gonna roll, bro.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.528
Get to the part
where you tell him

12:10.530 --> 12:12.263
we're stranded in the middle
of the ocean.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.998
So, Klaus, we're stuck
in the Atlantic --

12:14.000 --> 12:15.033
Pacific!

12:15.035 --> 12:16.401
Nerd.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.036
Anyway, we're in
the middle of an ocean.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.538
We are not by the edges, so you
don't have to check there.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.073
Just look
in the middle-ish area.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.842
And we've got a wolf,
so no rush.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.177
Oh, battery's dead.

12:26.179 --> 12:29.280
(splash)
I can't believe you wasted
our one chance to get rescued!

12:29.282 --> 12:30.849
Well, don't be angry.

12:30.851 --> 12:34.519
Let's pull up our fishing net
and have some breakfast.

12:34.521 --> 12:38.623
Hmm. I guess I was supposed to
tie one end to the boat.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.426
This is the stuff we would
edit out of the web series.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.930
(flute music plays)

12:45.932 --> 12:47.432
Oon-gak.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.433
Oon-gak?

12:48.435 --> 12:50.702
Oon-gak.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.739
Oon-gak!

12:54.741 --> 12:59.444
<i>I think "oon-gak" is their word</i>
<i> for coconut.</i>

12:59.446 --> 13:05.416
<i> Emboldened by primal feelings,</i>
<i> she makes a daring move.</i>

13:05.418 --> 13:09.387
<i> And the man,</i>
<i> feeling nature's throb...</i>

13:09.389 --> 13:10.588
<i> Runs away?</i>

13:10.590 --> 13:12.123
<i> Are -- are you kidding me?</i>

13:12.125 --> 13:14.659
<i> Flute Island?</i>

13:14.661 --> 13:16.261
<i> More like Blue Ball island.</i>

13:16.263 --> 13:20.331
(bells clanging)

13:23.804 --> 13:25.670
(flute music plays)

13:25.672 --> 13:29.274
<i> The simple wonders of nature</i>
<i> are quite breathtaking.</i>

13:29.276 --> 13:34.078
<i> But I am not the only one</i>
<i> enjoying the view.</i>

13:34.080 --> 13:36.681
<i> Something inside her stirs.</i>

13:36.683 --> 13:38.483
(breathing heavily)

13:40.153 --> 13:44.055
<i> She knows that she should</i>
<i> look away, but she cannot.</i>

13:57.938 --> 14:00.939
Oon-gak.

14:00.941 --> 14:04.342
<i> I am rock hard.</i>

14:04.344 --> 14:06.845
(rock music plays)

14:18.325 --> 14:19.657
Petty Officer Fischer?

14:19.659 --> 14:21.226
Morning, sir!
How are you feeling?

14:21.228 --> 14:22.527
Amazing, sir.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.895
I finally have a purpose.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.897
(chuckles) That's great.

14:25.899 --> 14:29.100
But you should know
you're doing a terrible job.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.040
You're just supposed to be
mopping the deck.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.909
Why don't you come up
to the bridge?

14:37.911 --> 14:39.477
You can be my spotter.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.478
Thank you, sir!

14:40.480 --> 14:41.579
(jet approaches)

14:41.581 --> 14:42.580
(tires screech)

14:42.582 --> 14:43.815
(splash)

14:43.817 --> 14:45.516
Oh, was that my fault?

14:45.518 --> 14:49.287
I don't know. Are you the guy
waving the [bleep] things?!

14:51.157 --> 14:53.258
I spy with my little eye

14:53.260 --> 14:56.995
something that is white
and red and black.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.196
My sun blisters.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.265
Bingo!
You're great at this, Steve.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.033
I'm dying.
You're just thirsty.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.869
The human body can only survive
three days without water.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.105
That's why in a pinch,
just drink salt water.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.907
That's the worst thing
you can do!

15:08.909 --> 15:11.075
Salt water just makes you
more dehydrated.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.877
Because people
don't drink enough.

15:12.879 --> 15:15.280
There's a tipping point
when the delicious water

15:15.282 --> 15:16.681
overwhelms the harmful salt.

15:16.683 --> 15:17.715
Here, I'll show you.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.918
Tipping point, here I come!

15:19.920 --> 15:22.420
(gulping)

15:25.792 --> 15:28.526
(gulps)
I feel incredible!

15:28.528 --> 15:30.094
It burns so good!

15:30.096 --> 15:31.262
Catch up, Steve!

15:31.264 --> 15:33.731
Roger, you're scaring me.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.867
(gulping)

15:40.740 --> 15:42.774
I'm so close
to the tipping point.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.242
No one's
ever done it right.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.110
They've always given up
because the sea madness

15:46.112 --> 15:48.146
makes them
kill their shipmates.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.447
(whimpers)

15:50.417 --> 15:52.917
(sighs) Lifeboat's
getting pretty cluttered.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.253
Tomorrow, we're gonna have to
throw some stuff in the sea.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.922
Lot of things are gonna have to
go into the sea.

15:57.924 --> 16:01.259
Oh, time for bed.
nighty-night.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.261
Um, it -- it -- it --
it's noon.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.163
You're lucky
the moon's blinded me, Steve,

16:05.165 --> 16:07.065
or I'd sock you
right in the nose.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.833
(whimpers)

16:10.003 --> 16:12.136
(flute music plays)
<i> Surely, this is the moment</i>

16:12.138 --> 16:15.173
<i> where their love</i>
<i> will finally bloom.</i>

16:22.015 --> 16:23.414
(snoring)

16:23.416 --> 16:25.683
<i> Are they serious?</i>
<i> Right to sleep?</i>

16:25.685 --> 16:27.285
<i> I can't take this anymore!</i>

16:27.287 --> 16:28.653
(footsteps approaching)

16:28.655 --> 16:30.288
<i> There we go.</i>

16:30.290 --> 16:31.622
(footsteps receding)

16:31.624 --> 16:33.091
<i> Ah.</i>

16:33.093 --> 16:34.993
<i> That should</i>
<i> get the ball rolling.</i>

16:38.198 --> 16:39.831
(both moaning)

16:39.833 --> 16:41.432
<i> And as the two lovers</i>

16:41.434 --> 16:44.102
<i> remembered what nature</i>
<i> has always known,</i>

16:44.104 --> 16:48.139
<i>the narrator took a break to do</i>
<i>something that is also natural,</i>

16:48.141 --> 16:51.009
<i> something he needed</i>
<i> both hands for.</i>

16:51.011 --> 16:52.443
(horse whinnies)

16:52.445 --> 16:54.879
<i> Ah, the horse gets it.</i>

16:57.384 --> 17:02.020
Okay, I see a bird,
lots of water...

17:02.022 --> 17:03.788
And a wave.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.990
Ooh, I see a cool cloud.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.692
Great work, Fischer.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.061
Captain, what is it
with you and this man?

17:10.063 --> 17:12.563
I have to ask,
is he your illegitimate child?

17:12.565 --> 17:14.565
(chuckles)
I fear he is.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.501
You know
how hard I go in port,

17:16.503 --> 17:18.836
and he looks a lot
like a woman that...

17:18.838 --> 17:20.338
(shudders)

17:20.340 --> 17:23.307
I used to pay
to step on my balls.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.913
The wolf and I
have been talking.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.815
Well, he's been talking,
I've been listening.

17:30.817 --> 17:34.152
We think you're
plotting against us.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.720
w-what happened to the wolf?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.388
He found out my secret!

17:37.390 --> 17:38.856
Do you want to hear
my secret?

17:38.858 --> 17:39.857
No.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.826
Okay.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.394
(growling)

17:43.396 --> 17:45.163
(both screaming)

17:47.200 --> 17:48.599
Stop, Roger! Just stop!

17:48.601 --> 17:50.568
Aaaaah!

17:54.674 --> 17:58.276
Steve, something happened.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.180
I think
I have something, sir!

18:04.551 --> 18:05.616
Hayley: Steve!

18:05.618 --> 18:08.453
Hayley!

18:08.455 --> 18:11.689
Well, we came together
and made it as a team, Steve.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.558
Looks like the person
you'd least like

18:13.560 --> 18:15.960
to be stuck on a lifeboat with
just saved your life.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.361
Listen to me jabbering on.

18:17.363 --> 18:19.030
I'm in the middle
of a big bike race.

18:19.032 --> 18:21.299
On your left!

18:21.301 --> 18:23.534
All right,
back to our mission.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.937
Operation destroy
all the islands.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.705
(chuckles)
Too many islands.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.107
Prepare to fire!

18:30.910 --> 18:32.477
Sir, wait!

18:32.479 --> 18:34.412
I believe there are some
young lovers on the island.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.613
-Really?
-I want to see!

18:35.615 --> 18:37.381
Me first!
Men, have you forgotten

18:37.383 --> 18:39.650
you are officers
in the United States Navy?

18:39.652 --> 18:41.152
Act like it!

18:41.154 --> 18:44.655
It's ladies first
to watch the dirty beach sex.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.325
Oh, my God!

18:47.327 --> 18:49.560
They are really going at it.

18:49.562 --> 18:53.097
Oh, my God!
My parents are alive!

18:53.099 --> 18:55.466
Let's just confirm...

18:55.468 --> 18:58.669
That it's really them.

18:58.671 --> 18:59.804
Babe?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.172
What?

19:01.174 --> 19:04.942
(flute music plays)

19:04.944 --> 19:07.945
<i> They were cut off from</i>
<i> everything in the world,</i>

19:07.947 --> 19:11.849
<i> but they fell in love</i>
<i> with the world they had.</i>

19:11.851 --> 19:13.184
(gasps)

19:13.186 --> 19:14.986
Oon-gak.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.021
Oon-gak.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.456
(moaning)

19:18.458 --> 19:20.424
<i> Oh, they're</i>
<i> ready to go again.</i>

19:20.426 --> 19:27.098
<i> And we wait on tenterhooks to</i>
<i>see if he does it in the brown.</i>

19:27.100 --> 19:29.000
(rumbling)

19:30.637 --> 19:32.036
Ooh...

19:32.038 --> 19:33.604
You have kids.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.972
-Mom, Dad!
-Mom, Dad!

19:34.974 --> 19:36.140
Oh, yeah.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.376
<i> We</i> have kids.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.278
Your boobs are out.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.215
So, the world didn't end,
and I'm not Noah.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.383
Sorry, guys.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.851
It's okay, dad.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.887
We're all together again,
and that's what matters.

19:49.889 --> 19:53.024
We're off the island.
Fire away, sir.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.660
(rocket launches)

19:55.662 --> 19:57.228
<i> Oh, no! Don't they know</i>

19:57.230 --> 19:59.664
<i> our dear narrator</i>
<i> is still on Fl--</i>

19:59.666 --> 20:02.233
(flutes play, stop)

20:04.804 --> 20:06.404
I think we both know

20:06.406 --> 20:10.074
there's always been
something there between us.

20:10.076 --> 20:14.245
Well, now we have the whole
house all to ourselves.

20:14.247 --> 20:17.381
(door opens)
She told me she was 18!

20:17.383 --> 20:19.750
Hmm.
Oh, gross -- Riesling.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.352
(gulping)

20:21.354 --> 20:25.323
So, we're supposed to go back
to our normal life and...

20:25.325 --> 20:27.258
And everything's just
how it was before?

20:27.260 --> 20:29.260
Yeah, honey.
What's wrong with that?

20:29.262 --> 20:30.995
Well, what was
all this for?

20:30.997 --> 20:32.363
All this stuff happened,

20:32.365 --> 20:34.332
and I don't even know
what it means!

20:34.334 --> 20:36.267
It means...

20:36.269 --> 20:38.336
Oon-gak.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.837
Oon-gak.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.539
Uh, what does
"oon-gak" mean?

20:41.541 --> 20:43.107
It kind of means...

20:43.109 --> 20:44.342
Coconut.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.743
(both moaning)

20:45.745 --> 20:48.279
Ugh, there was barely
any salt in that Riesling.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.248
I was dangerously hydrated.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.283
(gulping)

20:55.855 --> 20:56.787
Aaaah!

20:56.789 --> 20:58.289
Stop, Roger, just stop!

20:58.291 --> 20:58.723
Aaaaah!

21:02.195 --> 21:04.195
Bye-bye, see you soon!
