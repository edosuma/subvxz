WEBVTT

00:08.925 --> 00:10.927
-[Cindy] Wow.
-[Taylor laughs]

00:11.011 --> 00:13.013
Oh, my God. I'm running so fast.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.014
[Sara mock panting]

00:14.472 --> 00:16.516
-[Vanessa] First things first.
-[Shanice] Action plan.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.977
-[Menuka] Whoa! I like this.
-[Brandi] Oh.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.687
-Chain Reaction Machine.
-Those never work.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.690
-[Taylor] Five foot by five foot by three.
-[Sara] Three machines.

00:23.773 --> 00:27.235
-[Jacob] One large themed dessert.
-[Shanice] Uninterrupted chain reaction.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.154
[Renee] And finale dessert presentation.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.156
[Menuka] This is cool.

00:32.490 --> 00:37.579
Oh. Hey there, everybody. Welcome back
to our madcap pastry playground.

00:37.662 --> 00:41.166
Something tells me
there's gonna be a lot of reactions today.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.543
Specifically, chain reactions.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.755
You ever hear of my old buddy
Rube Goldberg? He was a nice enough guy,

00:46.838 --> 00:49.507
but always took forever
to get to the point.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.468
Kinda like I'm doing right now.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.762
Today, these bakineers will be building

00:53.845 --> 00:57.849
their own giant,
edible chain reaction machines.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.476
This is like an engineer's dream.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.022
[upbeat music playing]

01:05.106 --> 01:07.192
So, let's talk about Rube Goldberg

01:07.275 --> 01:09.903
and his wacky machines. Who was this guy?

01:10.403 --> 01:13.907
Rube Goldberg was an American engineer,
but he was also a cartoonist.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.992
And really he became most well-known

01:16.076 --> 01:18.703
for creating
these crazy chain reaction machines.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.831
And they were
these overly-engineered complex machines

01:21.915 --> 01:24.084
that achieved something simple in the end,

01:24.167 --> 01:26.711
but these things became
a pop-culture phenomenon.

01:26.795 --> 01:30.173
From a bakineering point of view,
we've told our teams to push the edible,

01:30.256 --> 01:33.593
but actually we can go
beyond the food itself.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.386
We wanna see a marriage of the edible

01:35.470 --> 01:37.347
and things that helped make the edible.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.515
Nice.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.058
[upbeat music playing]

01:40.141 --> 01:42.977
-[Brandi] Have you ever been tailgating?
-Yeah. One time. Pretty cool.

01:43.561 --> 01:44.854
Let's do a tailgate theme.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.440
-There's many things we can do with that.
-Oh!

01:47.524 --> 01:50.026
I did this road trip
when I was doing, like, cakes,

01:50.110 --> 01:52.153
and I stopped in every state,
I was antiquing.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.698
-That's so cool.
-It'd be cool if we did a 1950s kitchen.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.616
[Shanice] Okay.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.618
What's cool about chain reaction machines

01:58.701 --> 02:01.538
is that they incorporate
the basics of engineering,

02:01.621 --> 02:03.706
which are the six simple machines.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.126
What's the basic definition
for a simple machine?

02:06.209 --> 02:10.380
A simple machine is
the basic fundamental machine

02:10.463 --> 02:12.799
from which all other machines
are constructed.

02:12.882 --> 02:15.927
You can remember them
by thinking "LIPS-dub-dub."

02:16.010 --> 02:18.012
Lever, inclined plane,

02:18.513 --> 02:20.306
pulley, screw,

02:21.182 --> 02:23.059
wedge, and wheel and axle.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.646
LIPS-dub-dub. By the way,
I saw "LIPS-dub-dub" at Coachella.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.232
-They were fantastic.
-[judges laughing]

02:29.315 --> 02:31.943
Let's talk about what the bakineers
have to bake and build.

02:32.026 --> 02:35.864
Our teams will have 11 hours to create
an edible chain reaction machine,

02:35.947 --> 02:37.866
which is made up of three simple machines,

02:37.949 --> 02:40.952
and that final phase has to deliver us
a delicious themed dessert.

02:41.035 --> 02:43.163
We can put it into a pulley system.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.747
-Three pulleys.
-[Steve] Okay.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.292
We'll have some sort of
support system in the back.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.961
These could be made out of
rolling pins or something cute.

02:50.044 --> 02:52.005
That makes a good pulley,
because it twists.

02:52.088 --> 02:52.922
[Jacob] Exactly.

02:53.006 --> 02:57.135
The dominoes can knock
a lemon off of a shelf,

02:57.719 --> 02:59.554
that will cause this to rotate.

02:59.637 --> 03:00.638
[Cindy] Okay.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.266
[Joanne] From the baking side of things,

03:03.349 --> 03:08.229
these bakineers are creating
incredible, edible, themed worlds.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.733
I wanna see a variety
of edible mediums across all the machines,

03:11.816 --> 03:13.818
and the options are limitless here.

03:13.902 --> 03:18.406
But, ultimately,
the main purpose is that it delivers to us

03:18.489 --> 03:21.576
a show-stopping magnificent dessert.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.244
The ball will drop here,

03:23.995 --> 03:27.373
and flip the lever
around that way, like that.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.167
And then they'll open?

03:29.250 --> 03:30.835
[Sara] And the oven will open like this.

03:30.919 --> 03:35.882
Why don't we do
a spin on a pie as the final ta-da?

03:35.965 --> 03:37.800
-Okay, okay.
-[Randi] You know?

03:37.884 --> 03:39.844
What's your favorite type of pie?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.930
-I think of apple pie right away.
-[Jacob] Same!

03:42.013 --> 03:44.307
I'm Italian. You're from Peru. [chuckling]

03:44.390 --> 03:45.266
Yeah.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.768
Give me something to work with.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.686
There's a food I like called lucuma.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.688
-Lucuma.
-It's a tropical fruit.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.856
It's like an avocado.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.608
-I'll go get all our materials.
-Yes.

03:53.691 --> 03:54.859
-Sounds good.
-All right.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.028
-[upbeat music playing]
-[timer ticking]

03:58.947 --> 04:00.281
Start loading onto this cart.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.242
-I'm gonna take the mixer over.
-[Renee] Okay.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.452
[whirring]

04:06.496 --> 04:07.956
[Taylor] That's heavy! [chuckles]

04:08.539 --> 04:11.876
-Hello, Joey, Mario. How are you doing?
-[Joey] Hello. How are you?

04:11.960 --> 04:14.921
We're doing pretty well.
I think you'll be happy with our pieces.

04:15.004 --> 04:18.424
-Tell me about it. [chuckles]
-Well, what we have is a chem lab.

04:18.508 --> 04:22.095
Lab rats took over the lab,
imprisoned the professor,

04:22.178 --> 04:24.138
and they're just having a bit of a mutiny.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.141
We're gonna do the chain reaction
at a chem lab.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.143
We have an edible isomalt ball

04:29.227 --> 04:32.146
that is gonna roll down
from an inclined chalkboard,

04:32.230 --> 04:35.233
going down a second ramp
and then hitting the lever.

04:35.316 --> 04:38.695
The lever is gonna hit a second lever
that has a jawbreaker gumball.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.364
It's gonna go down and hit a flask

04:41.447 --> 04:43.574
that is gonna rotate
down an inclined plane,

04:43.658 --> 04:45.702
that is gonna cause
a domino chain reaction

04:45.785 --> 04:48.997
that will trigger a pendulum
to reveal our dessert.

04:49.914 --> 04:52.250
You've been in the danger zone
for two missions now,

04:52.333 --> 04:54.919
so what are you switching up today
to really wow us?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.088
Rather than go on our own,
we did it together,

04:57.171 --> 04:59.173
and on the dessert,
you'll see what we mean.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.508
What are we eating today?

05:00.591 --> 05:04.345
We're doing an Italian cheesecake
with a Peruvian glaze, which is a lucuma--

05:04.429 --> 05:05.805
-Did I say it correctly?
-Yeah.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.599
Lucuma, okay. We'll make a glaze
of that to really show you

05:08.683 --> 05:11.060
we really think of--
Not just combined our cultures,

05:11.144 --> 05:12.812
we combined our talents as well.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.189
-Best of luck, gents.
-Thank you. Have a good day.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.107
[timer ticking]

05:18.276 --> 05:19.736
I wanna talk about the height.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.030
'Cause this one's gonna come here, right?

05:22.113 --> 05:24.324
And it's gonna hit this, and go just here.

05:24.407 --> 05:28.369
We are creating a chain reaction machine
with the theme of "Life Is Messy"

05:28.453 --> 05:29.412
in an edible kitchen.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.622
It starts with a toy box on the floor

05:31.706 --> 05:34.667
made of Rice Krispies
and fondant and chocolate,

05:34.751 --> 05:39.172
down a series of stairs and ramps
over to a wall that has a series of levers

05:39.255 --> 05:43.092
made of kitchen utensils
and tempered chocolate rods.

05:43.176 --> 05:47.263
And then, it's gonna travel
around a corner, drop into another ladle,

05:47.347 --> 05:50.808
and open up an oven,
presenting an amazing dessert.

05:51.601 --> 05:55.980
[Rodolfo] I'm doing a cinnamon sponge cake
with apple filling and--

05:57.273 --> 05:58.691
-I forgot.
-Caramel buttercream?

05:58.775 --> 06:00.777
-Caramel buttercream. I'm so sorry.
-[laughs]

06:00.860 --> 06:03.946
-With a little bit of salt. [laughing]
-Yeah.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.990
-I'll take over from here.
-I know. [chuckles]

06:06.074 --> 06:07.367
Here, here, here.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.453
Do you know what you're gonna do?
Make a ramp.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.580
[Sara] We can still
make it look like a toy.

06:12.663 --> 06:15.333
-We'll just have it come down like this.
-[Rodolfo] Uh-huh.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.501
-Yeah.
-Right? Okay.

06:16.584 --> 06:21.214
The most important part is a toy box,
"Victor's Box." It's my son.

06:21.297 --> 06:25.635
It's gonna be kinda like a candy box,
like a toy box filled with candy.

06:25.718 --> 06:29.097
[Rodolfo] He's nine years old,
so I wanna put his name up there.

06:29.180 --> 06:33.935
Me and Victor, we make a mess at home,
and I love to have fun with my son.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.479
Cooking. He likes to stay around us.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.023
Sometimes,
if you have a very creative mind,

06:39.107 --> 06:40.483
you're very messy.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.984
[both laugh]

06:42.693 --> 06:44.695
-[Rodolfo] Okay. Then--
-They're gonna be--

06:44.779 --> 06:45.822
[Sara chuckles]

06:45.905 --> 06:47.573
You get back in the kitchen!

06:47.657 --> 06:49.951
-[energetic music playing]
-[timer ticking]

06:53.121 --> 06:54.414
[machine whirring]

07:06.759 --> 07:08.845
These lemons are, like, so perfect.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.097
Our theme is "bees."

07:11.639 --> 07:16.394
Bees are the beginning
of the massive chain reaction

07:16.477 --> 07:19.522
that lets all these edible mediums exist
in the first place.

07:19.605 --> 07:23.734
You can't really bake anything
without having bees as pollinators.

07:23.818 --> 07:27.780
So, all of our chain reaction
is inspired by their chain reaction.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.491
And they're so cute. They're just so cute.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.202
Yeah, they are cute.
Well, they're cute in--

07:33.286 --> 07:35.538
-Yeah, they're cute. They're cute.
-They're cute.

07:35.621 --> 07:39.000
-[laughing]
-Bees are cute. Let the record show.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.668
At the end of our chain reaction,

07:40.751 --> 07:43.754
it will present a lemon meringue tart

07:43.838 --> 07:47.049
with edible rose petals, blueberries,

07:47.133 --> 07:49.844
gold leaf and a shortbread thyme crust.

07:49.927 --> 07:53.222
So-- Oh wow! It's a bee!

07:53.306 --> 07:55.016
-[upbeat music playing]
-[timer ticking]

07:58.102 --> 07:59.687
[Steve] I turn wood for a hobby.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.815
So, I'm turning a wooden ball one day,
and I'm thinking,

08:02.899 --> 08:05.401
"Wow. Why can't I do this with chocolate?"

08:06.152 --> 08:08.863
We'd normally have to make a mold
to create a shape.

08:08.946 --> 08:12.116
I can just go straight
onto the lathe and turn any shape I want

08:12.200 --> 08:16.120
without even making a silicone mold.
I could just create it right there.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.831
-I'm doing one more piece, Renee, okay?
-[Renee] Okay.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.335
And then the lathe is finished.
Then it's a big cleanup of chocolate.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.963
-[Renee] Hello! How are you?
-Hello, Renee. How are you?

08:26.047 --> 08:28.966
I'm getting
a lot of cocoa vibes over here.

08:29.050 --> 08:32.386
Oh yeah. We are all about the chocolate
here on Team Reeve.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.680
Tell us a bit more
about your overall machine.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.934
Our design all around is gonna be
very unique across the board.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.728
We're doing "seasons."
Steve's doing a bird bath right now,

08:40.811 --> 08:43.064
where there's gonna be
a water pump inside.

08:43.564 --> 08:45.483
So, we start off with spring,

08:45.566 --> 08:47.693
which is a birdbath made of chocolate,

08:47.777 --> 08:50.613
and then the watering can
that's sitting on the birdbath

08:50.696 --> 08:54.951
will pour into a pulley system,
which will release a ball.

08:55.034 --> 08:58.412
The ball, in summer,
will roll down a slide through fall,

08:58.496 --> 09:00.706
which is gonna be in a pumpkin patch.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.500
When the ball reaches winter,

09:02.583 --> 09:05.378
there will be a lever system
made of gingerbread

09:05.461 --> 09:10.508
that will knock a New Year's bottle over
to release the New Year's treat.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.718
So, there's gonna be
a ball there, balanced.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.721
Right here. Yeah. And I calculated
through the entire thing--

09:15.805 --> 09:17.932
-[Hakeem] Yes.
-Calculated all of the angles.

09:18.015 --> 09:21.143
This is gonna be the most precise thing,
once we put it together.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.855
High risk, high reward kind of thing,
'cause there's a lot of stuff going on.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.233
We have to work
close together to get this done.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.734
-I'm pulling for you.
-Thanks.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.861
I'm pulling for you.
I see the skill there.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.905
-Just the matter of--
-Execution.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.490
-Executed well, yeah.
-Correct.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.492
Time is key, we won't keep you any longer.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.286
-Thank you both.
-Thank you so much.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.328
-Thank you.
-See you.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.747
-[energetic music playing]
-[timer ticking]

09:44.041 --> 09:47.128
-Right there?
-I'm doing this because with the lever--

09:47.211 --> 09:49.839
If it's not there,
the ball could just roll off.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.924
So it needs to be guided down this ramp.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.261
Growing up, I was really, really close
with my twin sister.

09:55.344 --> 09:58.097
Me and my sister had always
formed like this little bond,

09:58.180 --> 10:00.766
so it was just the two of us.
In elementary school,

10:00.850 --> 10:04.770
there was a thing called Math Superstars,
and me and my sister would always do it.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.107
That was one of the highlights
of our week. It is as nerdy as it sounds.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.527
I'm currently a manufacturing engineer
for an aerospace company.

10:11.611 --> 10:15.615
When I initially started in the industry,
I felt very unwelcome.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.784
I think that's kind of sad,
because no one should be used to

10:18.868 --> 10:21.120
constantly getting undermined
and belittled.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.789
So, now I'm very proud of who I am
and how far I've come.

10:23.873 --> 10:27.460
And I really want to help inspire
Black female engineers in the field

10:27.543 --> 10:29.629
and be happy and proud in their skin.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.255
Hello, Vanessa.

10:31.339 --> 10:35.092
-[Vanessa] Hi.
-Hello, Vanessa. What is this?

10:35.176 --> 10:36.135
-This--
-My goodness.

10:36.218 --> 10:39.472
These are gingerbread cookies,
but I'm making bookshelves out of them.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.058
-[Joanne] What are these?
-So, these are our turquoise tiles

10:42.141 --> 10:43.976
that we're gonna be putting on our floor.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.937
-Is this made out of fondant? Fondant.
-[Vanessa] This is fondant.

10:47.021 --> 10:50.941
For our chain reaction device,
we have about five simple machines.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.194
Our first simple machine
is wheel and axle,

10:53.277 --> 10:57.156
made using a cinnamon stick
with two isomalt wheels on the end.

10:57.239 --> 11:00.660
Our inclined planes and declined planes
are made using gingerbread.

11:00.743 --> 11:05.081
Our pulley is made using
a Rice Krispie bowl for counterweight.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.083
And we use a gingerbread cloche.

11:07.166 --> 11:11.003
Our final chain reaction is our cloche,
that gets pulled up

11:11.087 --> 11:12.797
and reveals our strawberry shortcake

11:12.880 --> 11:16.217
that is vanilla cake
with whipped cream filling

11:16.300 --> 11:17.843
and topped with strawberries.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.180
-We made a glass window.
-[Shanice] Mm-hmm.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.766
What did you make the glass out of?
Is it isomalt?

11:24.558 --> 11:27.311
I'm the proud owner
of One Love Cakes in Miami, Florida.

11:28.729 --> 11:31.816
One of my biggest motivations
in opening my own business

11:31.899 --> 11:34.610
was to be able to
fully employ my younger sister.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.613
She was born with osteogenesis imperfecta,

11:37.697 --> 11:40.616
otherwise known as OI, or brittle bones.

11:41.450 --> 11:45.579
Which, basically, if I was to accidentally
tap her or push her,

11:45.663 --> 11:46.997
one of her bones would break.

11:47.665 --> 11:53.212
As we've grown up, it's so difficult
for her to find a stable and secure job.

11:53.295 --> 11:58.259
So I opened up my own business
so that she could have a stable life

11:58.342 --> 12:00.720
and then be able to
follow her dreams in the future.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.264
-Keep learning.
-It looks great. Best of luck.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.349
-Thank you!
-Thank you so much.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.518
-[dramatic music playing]
-[timer ticking]

12:08.769 --> 12:10.354
-[Shanice] Are you baking today?
-I am!

12:10.438 --> 12:11.689
[Shanice chuckles] Me, too.

12:11.772 --> 12:14.150
I'm stretching out some modeling chocolate

12:14.233 --> 12:17.778
and getting it ready to outline
some honeycomb on our big board.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.156
With the size of it,
I'm doing a lot more--

12:20.740 --> 12:22.241
A lot more baking. [chuckles]

12:22.324 --> 12:25.619
-The magic is happening, Joanne.
-Aww. I like that.

12:25.703 --> 12:26.704
[laughs] You're so happy.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.206
The bakers and the engineers
are coming together.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.541
[Joanne] Agreed. It's amazing.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.793
[Andrew] Literal bakineering happening
between our eyes.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.712
-[Joanne] They learn from each other.
-Exactly!

12:34.795 --> 12:37.465
This is what I dreamed
these teams would be doing.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.674
[upbeat music playing]

12:39.550 --> 12:41.719
It's really like this.
That's what we want.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.392
-[Cindy] What are you doing?
-[Taylor] Programming the switch

12:48.476 --> 12:51.061
-that'll trip the heat gun.
-Uh-huh.

12:51.145 --> 12:54.648
[Taylor] Which is kind of trippy,
'cause I'm using honey as a conductor.

12:54.732 --> 12:55.858
[Cindy chuckles]

12:55.941 --> 12:58.027
-That's really cool, though.
-[Taylor] If it works.

12:58.110 --> 12:58.944
[both chuckle]

12:59.028 --> 13:01.030
-Hi, Brandi.
-[Brandi] Hey, how are you?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.199
-How you doing? Hi, Menuka.
-[Menuka] Hey, man.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.494
What can you tell me about, uh,
what we have to see today?

13:06.577 --> 13:10.289
Well, tailgating is one of my very
favorite things to do in the whole world.

13:10.372 --> 13:11.957
Uh-huh. It's better than the actual game.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.543
It is. Especially if you're
a Kentucky football fan.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.046
-But don't put that on camera.
-[Justin] I'll trust you. Yeah.

13:17.129 --> 13:21.300
Our edible chain reaction machine
will be tailgate themed.

13:21.884 --> 13:25.262
It'll feature a Kentucky backdrop

13:25.346 --> 13:27.932
and in the end, a beautiful trophy case

13:28.015 --> 13:32.436
made of isomalt panels
that will crack and reveal a trophy cake.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.731
I decided to go with a
Funfetti cake, which I know is a risk.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.109
It's kind of a basic cake.
Anybody can make a Funfetti cake,

13:39.193 --> 13:42.613
but you have to make
a really good-tasting Funfetti cake.

13:42.696 --> 13:47.368
But I really wanted
to encapsulate the atmosphere,

13:47.451 --> 13:49.829
and that is something
we would have at a tailgate,

13:49.912 --> 13:52.248
Funfetti cake with only blue sprinkles.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.124
Go Blue or go home.

13:54.792 --> 13:58.003
It's only a minimum of three machines,
but I think we should add more.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.548
-Don't forget our time management.
-[Menuka] I know.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.466
-[dramatic music playing]
-[timer ticking]

14:13.143 --> 14:15.271
[Steve] This pulley system is not working.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.314
[Renee] There's too much tension on it.
Uh…

14:21.610 --> 14:24.488
-Is it because this is backwards?
-If this is all the way down--

14:24.572 --> 14:26.448
Yeah, but look, it's twisted inside here.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.076
It needs to go up over the top
and down the other side,

14:29.159 --> 14:30.494
and not go through the loops.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.163
-Okay.
-Yeah. Take it apart, and rewire it.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.456
It won't work like that.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.376
We realized that we bit off
more than we could chew.

14:37.459 --> 14:41.213
I'm realizing
that my priorities need to change,

14:41.297 --> 14:44.842
because no matter how good it looks,
it still is not gonna work.

14:44.925 --> 14:48.846
So, we need to find the middle ground
between the engineering and the edible

14:48.929 --> 14:50.931
so that we can have a working product.

14:51.015 --> 14:51.849
[Steve] Cut this.

14:51.932 --> 14:52.975
Rewire it.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.145
And then we'll put those in place. Cut it.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.354
[timer ticking]

14:57.438 --> 15:00.107
Bakineers! We're down to three hours!

15:00.190 --> 15:02.192
Ah! Stop the clock, man!

15:02.276 --> 15:04.486
-[Menuka] Need more time.
-[Brandi] We need more time!

15:09.867 --> 15:12.453
[Vanessa] Once we finish assembling,
we need to test.

15:17.207 --> 15:20.210
[Joey] Ooh! Our rat fell!
He's cool, though.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.837
A little busted ear, but we're good.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.173
Can I get your attention, please!

15:24.256 --> 15:28.177
Cindy and Taylor, you earned the boost
from the last mission.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.929
Are you ready to hear what it is?

15:30.012 --> 15:31.138
-Yes.
-Let's hear it.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.265
[Justin] Are the rest of you
ready to be jealous?

15:33.349 --> 15:35.267
-[both laugh]
-Okay, just making sure.

15:35.351 --> 15:39.813
So, as you all know,
you have one shot to launch your machine.

15:40.314 --> 15:44.068
And if it doesn't serve up your dessert,
it means you failed the mission.

15:44.151 --> 15:47.071
Well, Cindy and Taylor,
since you won the boost,

15:47.154 --> 15:49.323
when you launch
your chain reaction machine,

15:49.406 --> 15:53.369
and if it doesn't work,
you get to try it a second time.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.620
Yay!

15:54.703 --> 15:56.872
-[Justin] A do-over.
-They get to try again.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.709
I just want to clarify
that do-over could mean intervening

16:00.793 --> 16:04.296
at any point if your machine fails,
or it could mean a complete restart.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.423
-That's completely up to you.
-Got it. Thanks.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.300
-[dramatic music playing]
-[timer ticking]

16:09.051 --> 16:10.010
Oh, my God.

16:11.553 --> 16:12.805
[machine whirring]

16:12.888 --> 16:16.433
We've definitely seen
that the teams that take the time to test

16:16.517 --> 16:17.393
are successful.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.561
If it was me, I'd have a full trial run.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.271
-If I could, but--
-Right.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.024
[Mario] Let's test them. Okay. Think.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.068
We can't touch the dominoes,
'cause I just--

16:26.151 --> 16:29.405
-[Vanessa] How are we supposed to test it?
-It will work. I know because I kept--

16:29.488 --> 16:32.074
-No, we have to test it.
-Vanessa. It will be fine.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.076
I won't go out and not test something.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.078
-We have to test.
-You wanna set that up?

16:36.161 --> 16:37.162
Know how long it took?

16:37.246 --> 16:40.040
-We have extra dominoes.
-I'm not worried about them breaking.

16:40.124 --> 16:43.794
Shanice, we have to test it out. We can't
just go out there and not test it out.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.171
Do you know how long it takes
to set up dominoes?

16:46.255 --> 16:49.258
I'll set them up myself,
but we have to test everything once.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.219
It's very frustrating.
And I'm saying, "Test, test, test,"

16:52.302 --> 16:54.638
and she's saying no,
to trust her that it'll work,

16:54.722 --> 16:58.559
but things don't work like that.
Just because you calculated left, right--

16:58.642 --> 17:01.979
It doesn't work like that.
You need to test it out. I even know that.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.314
-I know it'll be fine.
-That's not good enough.

17:04.398 --> 17:07.651
We have to test it
and physically see that it actually works.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.862
-[dramatic music playing]
-[timer ticking]

17:13.657 --> 17:14.908
[Sara] That looks lovely!

17:16.076 --> 17:17.119
[Joey] Come on, baby.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.872
Come on, baby. Keep rolling.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.667
-There?
-[Joey] The bottle has to be

17:23.751 --> 17:25.627
-closer to the bowl, right?
-[Mario] Mm-hmm.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.047
All right. I'm gonna have a heart attack.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.716
-[Vanessa] Did you test this?
-I'm not worried about that.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.469
-This needs to be attached to this.
-This needs to roll.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.428
[Shanice] Has to work.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.223
-Bakineers! Thirty minutes!
-[timer ticking]

17:40.059 --> 17:43.604
Things just take more time,
and you just can't make it up.

17:43.687 --> 17:46.648
-Are we gonna make it?
-[Menuka] We can do it, we can do it.

17:46.732 --> 17:47.733
[Taylor groans]

17:47.816 --> 17:51.445
I don't wanna let you down!
Or me down!

17:52.029 --> 17:53.530
-That's gonna go there?
-Yeah.

17:53.614 --> 17:57.951
It has to be weight-shifted to the front,
unless we're not going to make it bounce.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.119
It has to bounce.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.373
[Renee] We're gonna make it one big lever.

18:03.457 --> 18:06.001
[Steve] Even if you have one big lever,
the ball goes down there.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.504
Nothing's gonna--
You need the opposite reaction.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.298
-You don't have an opposite.
-I was trying to do two levers.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.634
-[Steve] It's not gonna happen.
-Our original design

18:13.717 --> 18:15.302
had three chocolate slides

18:15.385 --> 18:18.430
that I had to condense into two,
based on time.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.766
And, being that I changed the design,

18:20.849 --> 18:24.853
my final gingerbread lever
was slightly off, dimension-wise.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.480
What if we have the ball--?

18:26.563 --> 18:28.565
This is here standing up,

18:29.149 --> 18:34.571
and the ball hits it and this goes, like,
inwards into the ball.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.199
Like that.

18:37.282 --> 18:40.119
I'm trying to be calm
and also realizing at the same time

18:40.202 --> 18:42.663
that I look at the clock
and we're running out of time.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.374
So, I have to be concise
with my gingerbread lever.

18:45.457 --> 18:49.294
-I need the bottle attached here.
-[Steve] I gotta get some chocolate.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.547
Teams, 15 minutes!

18:51.630 --> 18:53.257
-[Menuka] Fifteen minutes.
-[Renee] Go.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.424
[Steve] What do you need?

18:54.508 --> 18:56.301
-[dramatic music playing]
-[timer ticking]

18:56.385 --> 18:59.555
-[Renee] I need that glue gun.
-[Steve] But there's no glue in it!

18:59.638 --> 19:01.515
Could I borrow your glue gun glue?

19:02.516 --> 19:03.600
[shatters]

19:04.434 --> 19:05.352
[Steve] What was that?

19:05.435 --> 19:08.856
Steve and Renee just had a little bit
of a casualty fall off the front.

19:08.939 --> 19:09.773
[Renee] No!

19:10.357 --> 19:13.569
-Okay, okay. Um… All right.
-[Steve] All right.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.154
-All right.
-[Steve] Game over.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.531
-[Steve] It broke.
-Can we make it out of wood?

19:18.031 --> 19:18.907
We can try.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.453
-You've got only five minutes left.
-Oh, my God.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.705
Just need a little time.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.208
[Rodolfo] Put the ball up there.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.587
[Sara laughs]

19:31.670 --> 19:32.880
Good thing we're testing.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.090
[Taylor] I'll place
the edible flowers on the chute.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.008
[Cindy] Okay.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.217
Looks dumb.

19:37.718 --> 19:41.013
-Can you tell me if the oven lights up?
-[Joey] Is that supposed to be here?

19:41.597 --> 19:42.556
-[oven dings]
-Yep.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.642
-[Shanice] Bowl's gonna break.
-If our bowl's gonna break,

19:45.726 --> 19:48.187
-get the watermelon.
-[Shanice] The watermelon is too heavy.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.481
One minute.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.649
[groans]

19:52.733 --> 19:54.401
[wood creaking]

19:54.484 --> 19:55.319
[Renee] That's fine.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.239
-[Joey] Gotta go straight.
-[Cindy] Wanna put a bee on it?

19:59.323 --> 20:00.282
Yeah. Perfect.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.950
[Renee] Steve, I need your help here.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.164
-[Justin] Ten. Nine.
-[timer ticking]

20:07.247 --> 20:08.874
-Eight. Seven.
-[Renee] It'll hit them!

20:08.957 --> 20:11.585
-[Sara] Corner. Here.
-[Justin] Six. Five.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.295
Four. Three.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.673
Two. One. Your time is up!

20:16.757 --> 20:19.968
-[Steve] It's gonna hit the floor.
-[Justin] Frosting and fulcrums down!

20:22.971 --> 20:24.890
-What a mess. It's all good.
-[sighs]

20:24.973 --> 20:26.016
[Menuka sighs]

20:26.725 --> 20:27.935
Can I go take a nap now?

20:28.518 --> 20:29.728
[dramatic music playing]

20:40.989 --> 20:42.241
[Justin] Bakineers.

20:44.284 --> 20:48.789
Welcome to your Baking Impossible
chain reaction machine stress test.

20:49.456 --> 20:50.958
You'll come over to your station,

20:51.041 --> 20:54.962
tell us about what you've created,
and then it's time for the activation.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.215
We're gonna be hoping to see four phases,
and in that final phase,

20:58.298 --> 21:01.009
you'll be delivering a delicious dessert
for us to try.

21:02.886 --> 21:05.764
Up first, Team Rodolfo and Sara.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.683
-[contestants applaud]
-Meet us at your kitchen.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.187
[Sara] We went with the theme
of "Life Is Messy."

21:12.771 --> 21:14.356
Especially around mealtime.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.943
Now, we're just this close to be living
in the future and the smart home.

21:18.026 --> 21:21.488
So, our machine is
representing that transition.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.825
-What are your three simple machines?
-Inclined planes.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.286
These all act as levers,
as well as the oven door,

21:27.369 --> 21:30.038
which will be a lever,
and we have a pulley at the end.

21:30.122 --> 21:30.956
[Justin] There we go.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.793
-Who is Victor?
-[Rodolfo] That's my inspiration.

21:34.876 --> 21:37.212
-[Justin] Your inspiration. Aww!
-That's my son, yeah.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.381
So, I needed to put him somewhere here.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.258
-How old is Victor?
-Nine years old.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.677
So, he's the messy inspiration
to "Life Is Messy."

21:43.760 --> 21:45.262
[laughs]

21:45.345 --> 21:48.557
Is he the motivation for you
in the competition across the board?

21:48.640 --> 21:51.768
-That's why I'm here. It's for him.
-[Justin] Good. Let's make Victor proud.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.103
Let's do it.

21:53.186 --> 21:54.062
[Rodolfo chuckles]

21:54.146 --> 21:55.355
[dramatic music playing]

22:11.872 --> 22:13.874
-[Sara gasps, exclaims]
-[all cheering, laughing]

22:14.541 --> 22:18.253
[Sara] I'm so happy! That is so great!

22:18.337 --> 22:21.089
-That was so satisfying.
-That was very satisfying.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.342
-Whew!
-[Sara and Rodolfo laughing]

22:23.425 --> 22:26.803
You have a machine that converts
potential energy into kinetic energy

22:26.887 --> 22:28.805
and does that in four stages.

22:28.889 --> 22:32.017
It really kept me on the edge of my seat.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.561
It was delightful for us to watch it.

22:34.644 --> 22:39.149
I think this is a very smart design.
Your use of edible, again, very clever.

22:39.232 --> 22:42.694
I'm delighted to see everything that moved
was on an edible surface.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.155
Your use of utensils
ties in with the theme.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.699
-I think you've done a very good job.
-Thank you.

22:47.783 --> 22:51.703
Rodolfo, Sara. Now that we have been
served up our tasty treat,

22:51.787 --> 22:53.372
let's eat. Pull it out of the oven.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.332
-Oh, it's hot.
-[Sara chuckles]

22:55.415 --> 22:56.958
-[Joanne] It's hot.
-[Andrew] It's hot.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.669
-I just wanna put my face in it. [chomps]
-[laughs]

23:00.253 --> 23:02.631
[Rodolfo] It's a cake
that tastes like a pie.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.552
-Oh, my gosh.
-[Andrew] That's not foil.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.554
[Joanne] I thought
that was a cake in a tin.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.890
-[Andrew chuckles] Thought it was a tin.
-[Joanne] Wow.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.017
Hey, leave the illusions to me.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.685
-Okay, guys?
-[all laugh]

23:17.187 --> 23:20.107
[Rodolfo] It's a cinnamon cake
with apple filling

23:20.190 --> 23:22.692
and salted caramel buttercream.

23:24.694 --> 23:29.241
Rodolfo, what a clever idea to make a pie
that is actually a cake.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.576
And what a well-done cake.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.204
The sponge is light and fluffy.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.832
The buttercream is really well-flavored.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.584
The modeling chocolate
that coats the cake,

23:39.668 --> 23:42.671
it's not really meant to be edible,
even though you can eat it.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.714
I don't think any of us
are going to eat it.

23:44.798 --> 23:48.510
The next time around, you can do really
strong Italian buttercream,

23:48.593 --> 23:51.221
that would be delicious,
that could look just as realistic.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.765
Wow. I love the balance.

23:53.849 --> 23:57.394
If I close my eyes,
it is like I'm eating an apple pie,

23:57.477 --> 23:59.688
so you completely achieved
what you were after.

23:59.771 --> 24:00.939
Thank you.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.276
All right, Rodolfo, Sara.
Thank you very much.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.653
-[both] Thank you.
-[Justin] Head back to the teams.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.864
-Steve and Renee.
-[contestants applaud, cheer]

24:08.947 --> 24:10.740
-[Taylor] Yeah!
-[Menuka] Go get it.

24:11.908 --> 24:16.121
[Renee] Our chain reaction machine
is all four seasons, and New Year's.

24:16.204 --> 24:19.708
And the reason why we did this
was because I'm from the Northeast

24:19.791 --> 24:21.585
and Steve is from Wales.

24:21.668 --> 24:24.880
Now I live in California
and Steve lives in Florida.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.007
-Florida.
-So we don't have seasons anymore.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.133
[Steve] We're missing it.

24:28.216 --> 24:30.719
We have a watering pump
that starts the chain reaction.

24:30.802 --> 24:34.264
And then we have a pulley system
and an inclined plane.

24:35.724 --> 24:39.352
Steve, Renee, let's see this
chain reaction machine do its thing.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.271
-All right. Let's see.
-Go, Steve. [giggles]

24:42.147 --> 24:42.981
Team Reeve!

24:43.982 --> 24:45.108
I am ready.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.401
[dramatic music playing]

24:49.237 --> 24:50.447
[judges chuckling]

24:50.530 --> 24:52.449
[Renee] We're watering summer. [chuckles]

24:54.367 --> 24:56.995
-You sure you put it in the right place?
-Yeah, it's good.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.208
[Steve] Pulley's moving. Come on.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.084
-Just a few more drops.
-[Renee] You can do it!

25:03.168 --> 25:05.587
-[Steve] Let's go. Oh, oh…
-[Renee gasps]

25:05.670 --> 25:08.048
-[Andrew] Yeah!
-[Renee] The fondant.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.175
[Andrew] Aw.

25:10.258 --> 25:12.802
-Fondant was holding it.
-What happened, Steve?

25:12.886 --> 25:15.472
Well, the fondant I put in place
to hold the cup

25:15.555 --> 25:18.141
stopped the ball from rolling,
I should've realized that.

25:18.225 --> 25:19.935
Should've been thought out better.

25:20.018 --> 25:23.855
Can you show us
what would've happened in an ideal run?

25:23.939 --> 25:26.483
Let's have a laugh. We're gonna have fun.

25:26.566 --> 25:27.817
And there it goes.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.528
[Renee chuckles]

25:32.489 --> 25:33.573
[Steve] Bye.

25:38.578 --> 25:41.331
Clearly, something is missing
from your device.

25:41.414 --> 25:43.208
What is that missing element?

25:43.291 --> 25:46.169
There was a double-lever system
made out of gingerbread,

25:46.253 --> 25:49.756
and then the gingerbread had
a chocolate champagne bottle,

25:49.839 --> 25:52.926
but it was going to knock the chocolate
and break it,

25:53.009 --> 25:55.387
revealing the New Year's drop the ball.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.641
When I look at your simple machines,
not a single one worked.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.561
Your water pump wasn't calibrated,

26:02.644 --> 26:04.854
nor was your release mechanism.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.856
Then, your inclined plane,

26:06.940 --> 26:11.528
the inner diameter of the tube
matches the diameter of the ball.

26:11.611 --> 26:14.781
That's a dangerous situation.
Your ball can get stuck.

26:14.864 --> 26:17.367
I think you guys come up
with amazing designs,

26:17.450 --> 26:19.869
but then, in the end,
there's some sort of disaster.

26:20.954 --> 26:23.707
Let's just bring about New Year by force.

26:23.790 --> 26:26.001
-All right.
-[Justin] Show us what our dessert is.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.628
-[Steve] Destroy.
-[judges] Happy New Year!

26:28.712 --> 26:30.547
-[all laugh]
-[festive music playing]

26:31.339 --> 26:32.882
Steve, cut it up for us.

26:32.966 --> 26:36.177
[Steve] It's a champagne zabaglione
with some strawberries inside,

26:36.261 --> 26:38.597
and I made a simple syrup
with the champagne.

26:38.680 --> 26:42.309
Then, I used a German-style buttercream
to create the dome.

26:42.392 --> 26:45.854
And then I covered that in a fondant,
brushed with gold Luster Dust.

26:46.354 --> 26:48.148
Steve, I love the idea of this dessert.

26:48.231 --> 26:52.444
It is really moist
and creamy and well-balanced.

26:52.527 --> 26:53.361
Thank you.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.031
Were you happy
with the champagne zabaglione itself?

26:56.114 --> 26:57.782
It looked like it split in places,

26:57.866 --> 27:00.827
but that may be just
where the buttercream had been mixed in.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.663
It did split. You picked up on that.
[frustrated grunts]

27:03.747 --> 27:05.165
-[laughs]
-[judges chuckling]

27:05.749 --> 27:08.168
I was hoping
nobody was gonna notice that.

27:08.918 --> 27:11.171
Flavor-wise and the sponge
were really spot on.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.422
Thank you.

27:12.505 --> 27:14.841
-Randi and Jacob.
-[contestants cheer]

27:16.885 --> 27:18.136
-Hello.
-[Jacob] How you doing?

27:19.095 --> 27:22.098
I would like to introduce you
to the J &amp; R Diner.

27:22.682 --> 27:26.770
We really wanted to embody
the experience that you might have

27:26.853 --> 27:28.980
at a classic diner in our piece.

27:29.064 --> 27:32.317
There is a 25-cent quarter
sitting on the ground there.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.694
If you insert that
into our gumball machine,

27:34.778 --> 27:36.237
there's a little wedge in there.

27:36.321 --> 27:39.074
The wedge is gonna nudge
a, uh, little gumball.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.034
It's gonna go down our inclined plane,

27:41.117 --> 27:43.870
made hastily out of a paper towel tube.

27:43.953 --> 27:46.122
That's gonna knock over some levers,

27:46.206 --> 27:49.209
also known as our
white chocolate dominoes, sitting there.

27:49.292 --> 27:52.796
When the last domino
falls off of the diner stool,

27:52.879 --> 27:54.547
it'll trigger our soda machine.

27:54.631 --> 27:59.928
And as water fills up the cup,
it's gonna activate our pulley system,

28:00.011 --> 28:02.847
which is gonna pull
our mustard bottle off of a switch,

28:02.931 --> 28:07.686
which is gonna turn on the oven light,
and thus present your beautiful apple pie.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.397
Should we take a trip
down Memory Lane to the diner?

28:11.231 --> 28:14.526
Justin, if you wouldn't mind,
the quarter's sitting on the ground there.

28:14.609 --> 28:16.695
-I'm gonna start it?
-[Jacob] If you wouldn't mind.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.781
All right. Justin, you can activate

28:19.864 --> 28:21.908
-the chain reaction machine in--
-[drum roll]

28:21.991 --> 28:24.619
-I have to talk to myself. It's just--
-[all laugh]

28:24.703 --> 28:28.164
It's how I function. In three, two, one.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.499
[dramatic music playing]

28:33.628 --> 28:34.713
It takes a second.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.717
Whoa. [chuckles]

28:41.970 --> 28:44.180
-[oven dings]
-[Joanne gasps] Oh!

28:44.264 --> 28:45.932
-[chuckles]
-[all applaud]

28:46.015 --> 28:49.185
You've successfully passed
the stress test. How do you feel?

28:49.269 --> 28:50.687
-I'm excited. [chuckles]
-Yeah.

28:50.770 --> 28:54.566
I'm glad it all worked.
We tested it exactly once?

28:55.233 --> 28:57.193
-[Randi] I think.
-Exactly once, yeah. [chuckles]

28:57.277 --> 29:02.949
Having someone who had nothing to do
with the building start it was a big risk,

29:03.032 --> 29:04.242
yet it worked perfectly.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.369
It pushed the gumball,
as it was supposed to.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.580
The domino levers fell over perfectly.

29:08.663 --> 29:11.332
Your soda machine worked so well.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.793
-Great job.
-That was him. [chuckles]

29:13.877 --> 29:16.463
I thought you went for
a very ambitious design,

29:16.546 --> 29:18.673
executing a lot of your moving parts
at height.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.384
There was a certain amount of risk to that
and it paid off.

29:21.468 --> 29:25.013
I particularly loved your use
of the rolling pins in the pulley.

29:25.096 --> 29:28.767
It is almost a shame that we got
a little cardboard tube going onto there.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.936
It's the only element for me
that just sticks out a little bit.

29:32.020 --> 29:32.854
Okay. Yeah.

29:32.937 --> 29:35.857
In general, I think you've done
a good job, and it operated well.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.233
Thank you, thank you.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.862
Well, Randi, Jacob,
now that our dessert is illuminated,

29:40.945 --> 29:43.573
it looks irresistible.
So, let's serve it up.

29:44.073 --> 29:48.787
[Randi] We decided to come up with
our own version of a classic apple pie.

29:48.870 --> 29:53.291
It is a vanilla cake recipe
with sautéed apples on the top

29:53.374 --> 29:56.920
with Jacob's grandmother's
apple pie crust recipe

29:57.003 --> 29:58.880
that I created as a lattice.

30:01.299 --> 30:05.053
Your cake is mellow,
well-spiced, not too sweet.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.096
-Beautifully done. Really fun.
-[Randi] Thanks.

30:07.180 --> 30:11.017
One improvement,
bake the pie crust a little bit further.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.685
It'll get flakier,

30:12.769 --> 30:14.771
-the floury taste will disappear.
-[Randi] Mm-hmm.

30:14.854 --> 30:17.732
It'll add even more caramelization
to the entire cake.

30:17.816 --> 30:18.900
Thank you.

30:20.109 --> 30:22.195
-Brandi and Menuka.
-[all applaud]

30:22.278 --> 30:25.365
[Menuka] Brandi and I decided
to go with a tailgate theme.

30:25.448 --> 30:28.034
We have five simple machines, actually.

30:28.993 --> 30:31.788
It starts with
Brandi's gonna throw the bean sack

30:31.871 --> 30:34.624
and hit the mark and flip

30:34.707 --> 30:36.543
and dissolve the rice paper.

30:36.626 --> 30:39.754
We have rice paper
actually attached like two counterweight.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.257
One counterweight right here,
another right here.

30:42.340 --> 30:46.553
That's gonna break apart,
activate this simple lever right here,

30:46.636 --> 30:47.804
push the ball.

30:47.887 --> 30:50.974
It's going to come down on the ramp,
and it's gonna hit this beam

30:51.057 --> 30:52.058
and jump to here,

30:52.642 --> 30:57.856
and push the wheel and axle, which
contain a little candle, burn the wire,

30:58.356 --> 31:02.402
and release the jawbreakers,
and hitting the glass.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.279
[Justin clears throat]

31:04.362 --> 31:05.488
Wow.

31:06.739 --> 31:10.535
Brandi and Menuka,
set off this machine in three, two, one.

31:12.078 --> 31:12.954
[Brandi] Oh, no!

31:13.454 --> 31:14.998
I only get three tries!

31:16.666 --> 31:18.001
Oh, no!

31:21.129 --> 31:24.173
-[Menuka] The break-- Piece is soaking.
-[Justin] Paper's dissolving.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.508
[dramatic music playing]

31:30.221 --> 31:31.639
[Andrew and Joanne gasp]

31:31.723 --> 31:33.933
-[Joanne] Oh.
-Oh, my gosh!

31:34.767 --> 31:37.478
Menuka,
why don't you show us just manually,

31:37.562 --> 31:39.439
with the meatball, what it would've done?

31:44.235 --> 31:45.862
-[Hakeem] Oh.
-[Joanne] Ah!

31:45.945 --> 31:47.071
[Hakeem] It does do it.

31:47.155 --> 31:50.033
So, hopefully, that's gonna burn the wire,

31:50.116 --> 31:53.036
and release the jawbreakers
and hitting the--

31:53.620 --> 31:54.454
The glass.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.957
I think the candle went
too much right there.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.127
-[Hakeem] It's pretty far away.
-[Menuka] The candle went too far.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.212
We need to get into that dessert somehow.

32:03.796 --> 32:06.841
If these judges don't get their desserts,
they get hangry.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.679
-[Justin] Yeah!
-There we go!

32:11.763 --> 32:13.973
-[Andrew] There it is!
-[Hakeem laughs]

32:14.057 --> 32:16.225
[Brandi] That's just so frustrating!

32:16.309 --> 32:17.518
What happened?

32:17.602 --> 32:19.103
I know we're both capable.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.688
We both deserve to be here,

32:20.772 --> 32:24.108
but, at the same time, this is--
It's complicated.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.569
I tend to overengineer too much.

32:26.653 --> 32:30.156
It's very complex,
but, at the same time, I wanna have fun.

32:30.239 --> 32:33.451
I want to challenge myself,
and I think that's the case here.

32:34.327 --> 32:36.412
Your design was very high-risk,

32:36.496 --> 32:40.124
from the velocity of the ball
coming off the first set of bread-buns,

32:40.208 --> 32:42.377
to the candle actually burning
through the rope,

32:42.460 --> 32:45.088
to the jawbreakers breaking the panes.

32:45.588 --> 32:48.257
This was a very,
extremely high-risk design

32:48.841 --> 32:52.929
and, unfortunately, because of that,
you did not pass the stress test.

32:54.305 --> 32:57.767
Brandi and Menuka,
this cake could be your Hail Mary pass.

32:57.850 --> 32:59.143
[Brandi] I went a little simple.

32:59.227 --> 33:02.271
I did Funfetti cake,
added some Pop Rocks to the middle.

33:02.355 --> 33:03.940
I hope that they're still popping.

33:04.023 --> 33:05.608
[tense music playing]

33:08.069 --> 33:09.737
Brandi, the cake is delicious.

33:10.530 --> 33:13.700
It's really buttery and soft and tender.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.660
I got a pop in the back of my tongue.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.787
-Oh, good.
-There's a little residue.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.914
So, I'm feeling
a little bit of a celebration.

33:21.082 --> 33:26.004
It is sweet. Maybe finding a buttercream
that's a little bit less sweet might help.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.380
It's hard in the South.

33:27.463 --> 33:29.590
Everybody wants sweet.
Sweet tea, sweet cake--

33:29.674 --> 33:32.010
I'm from the South,
and I found it perfectly sweet.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.971
-Thank you! [chuckles]
-[Joanne laughing]

33:35.054 --> 33:39.308
Clearly, your machine didn't pass
the stress test. There was a lot going on.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.436
You perhaps overstretched it slightly.

33:41.519 --> 33:45.356
I think you gave yourselves
a lot to do today, to tie together.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.233
-Thank you very much.
-[both] Thank you.

33:47.316 --> 33:49.110
Cindy and Taylor.

33:49.193 --> 33:50.945
-[all applaud]
-[Taylor] Ooh!

33:52.321 --> 33:57.326
Our chain reaction machine is inspired by
the chain reaction of bees as pollinators.

33:57.410 --> 34:00.538
We've got lever, inclined plane,

34:00.621 --> 34:05.293
all of these nubs sticking out
act as pulleys, and this pendulum.

34:06.502 --> 34:09.422
Now, Cindy and Taylor,
as you remember, you won the last mission,

34:09.505 --> 34:12.717
and your advantage from that is
that if your chain reaction machine

34:12.800 --> 34:15.887
happens to fail the first attempt,
you get a do-over.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.306
[Andrew] That do-over
could mean intervening

34:18.389 --> 34:20.099
if any part of your machine fails,

34:20.183 --> 34:23.311
or it could be a complete restart.
That's completely up to you.

34:23.394 --> 34:24.729
Cindy and Taylor. You ready?

34:24.812 --> 34:25.646
-[both] Yeah.
-Okay.

34:25.730 --> 34:26.939
[dramatic music playing]

34:37.950 --> 34:39.952
As the honey's flowing,
it's increasing mass

34:40.036 --> 34:43.122
on the top of this little foil cup.
Once it's sufficiently heavy,

34:43.206 --> 34:45.583
the top of the cup will connect
the circuit,

34:45.666 --> 34:47.293
which will trip this heat gun.

34:49.003 --> 34:52.840
As pendulums do, they want to be
in the middle of their swing.

34:56.135 --> 35:01.599
[groans] It is actually flowing,
like, two millimeters away.

35:02.391 --> 35:04.060
No, I don't think so.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.939
I would love to use
my one touch to touch this.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.442
[heat gun whirring]

35:12.777 --> 35:14.445
So, now we got a heat gun.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.034
[Andrew] Oh!

35:21.077 --> 35:23.162
-[Taylor and Cindy laugh]
-[all applaud]

35:23.246 --> 35:24.080
[Justin sighs]

35:24.789 --> 35:25.623
Yay.

35:25.706 --> 35:29.377
As far as your engineering goes,
you had a really nice design,

35:29.460 --> 35:32.255
but I feel like,
even though it's really simple,

35:32.338 --> 35:34.590
you overengineered it.

35:34.674 --> 35:38.261
You had two elements
that just were too complicated.

35:38.344 --> 35:42.682
Luckily, you had the advantage
from winning the previous mission.

35:42.765 --> 35:45.268
This is a very Cindy and Taylor design,

35:45.351 --> 35:47.353
lots of delights for the eye,

35:47.436 --> 35:51.107
but it perhaps isn't as cohesive
with the theme as I might have hoped.

35:51.691 --> 35:55.069
Why are we finding kitchen equipment
in the middle of this bee sanctuary?

35:55.153 --> 35:58.364
Could this stool that we've got,
could we've made that into a hexagon,

35:58.447 --> 36:01.409
-so it's a nice framing for your dessert?
-Definitely.

36:01.492 --> 36:04.537
Bringing them more together
would've worked a little better here.

36:05.037 --> 36:07.790
Now that our dessert has been adorned
with edible flowers,

36:07.874 --> 36:09.500
let's serve it up.

36:09.584 --> 36:13.045
[Cindy] It is a lemon meringue tart
with a thyme shortbread crust,

36:13.129 --> 36:16.340
fresh blueberries
and edible rose petals on top.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.928
The meringue is beautifully done.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.890
The curd is nice and tart,
nice and balanced.

36:23.973 --> 36:26.475
The crust is thick

36:26.559 --> 36:28.269
and underbaked.

36:28.853 --> 36:32.356
I would roll it out thinner next time.
Bake it a little bit longer.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.274
Okay.

36:33.774 --> 36:36.360
Cindy and Taylor,
you can head back to the teams.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.571
-Joey, Mario.
-[all applaud]

36:40.198 --> 36:42.992
[Joey] First, we'd like to introduce you
to our chemistry lab.

36:43.075 --> 36:46.329
As you can plainly see,
the lab rats have taken over.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.539
-[chuckles]
-We are are using inclined planes,

36:48.623 --> 36:50.499
or declined planes, in this case,

36:50.583 --> 36:53.878
that are gonna bounce back
and they're gonna trigger a lever.

36:53.961 --> 36:56.297
And then,
we're gonna trigger this second ball.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.382
The first one
that I'm gonna use is gonna be…

36:59.842 --> 37:01.219
an iso-ball.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.972
Which is gonna trigger this flask
that's gonna roll down,

37:05.056 --> 37:06.599
gonna push a second jawbreaker,

37:06.682 --> 37:10.019
and then it's gonna start
a chain reaction domino effect

37:10.102 --> 37:12.438
on our flasks and test tubes,

37:12.939 --> 37:17.443
which are gonna trigger our pendulum
to finally reveal the secret dessert.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.445
Joey, Mario,

37:19.528 --> 37:23.324
let's see if this lab rat mutiny
will deliver the judges their treats.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.159
Okay. Here we go.

37:28.537 --> 37:29.830
[dramatic music playing]

37:41.592 --> 37:43.469
[all cheering and laughing]

37:47.723 --> 37:48.599
Good job, buddy.

37:48.683 --> 37:49.684
How do you feel?

37:49.767 --> 37:51.018
-Awesome.
-Relieved.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.562
-[judges chuckle]
-It's a successful mission.

37:53.646 --> 37:54.730
Finally feels good.

37:54.814 --> 37:57.984
I'm really impressed.
That seemed to go exactly to plan.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.527
There's no hitches there at all.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.070
-Thankfully not.
-Thankfully not.

38:01.153 --> 38:05.408
From your cheese declined planes
to your many levers,

38:05.491 --> 38:08.119
tumbling dominoes and lab flasks,

38:08.202 --> 38:10.037
all of your machines worked beautifully.

38:10.121 --> 38:13.416
Well, now, the fun part. We get to eat.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.752
[Joey] It's an Italian cheesecake.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.005
On top, we have a lucuma.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.756
A Peruvian national fruit.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.426
And I did a praline crust on the outside.

38:26.345 --> 38:29.849
Well, I am very impressed
by this Italian cheesecake.

38:29.932 --> 38:32.143
-Wow, thank you.
-[Joanne] It is really well done.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.686
-Thank you.
-[Joanne] It's light.

38:33.769 --> 38:36.022
It's a bit grainy,
which Italian cheesecakes are,

38:36.105 --> 38:38.149
but it's actually a pleasant graininess.

38:38.232 --> 38:40.943
It balances out really well
with the citrus that's in here.

38:41.027 --> 38:43.321
It looks like the praline crust
is a bit overbaked.

38:43.404 --> 38:46.532
-Yeah. I did notice that.
-But it's really delicious.

38:46.615 --> 38:48.701
Thank you so much. Thank you.

38:48.784 --> 38:51.370
The inside of this cheesecake,
that is a perfect texture.

38:51.454 --> 38:52.830
The flavors are excellent,

38:52.913 --> 38:55.833
and I think
it's a real marriage made in heaven.

38:55.916 --> 38:57.668
Thank you so much. Thank you.

38:57.752 --> 38:59.503
Knowing the judges and their palates,

38:59.587 --> 39:02.965
where they've been around the world,
I just was humbled and, uh--

39:03.049 --> 39:05.259
And blown away by how much they loved it.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.386
-You're right. I might cry.
-[fake sniffs]

39:07.970 --> 39:09.347
I can't be more proud.

39:09.430 --> 39:12.725
I poured my heart into this one,
and I'm glad they loved it.

39:13.726 --> 39:17.521
-[exhales sharply]
-Joey, Mario, thank you guys so much.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.773
[contestants applaud]

39:18.856 --> 39:21.359
-Vanessa and Shanice.
-[contestants applaud]

39:23.903 --> 39:28.574
[Vanessa] Our chain reaction machine
is a 1950s grandma's kitchen.

39:29.283 --> 39:34.080
We will start off the whole chain reaction
with an isomalt ball at the top here,

39:34.163 --> 39:37.249
go down a few incline planes,
go up a declined plane,

39:37.750 --> 39:41.462
activate a lever,
which will then go down another plane

39:41.545 --> 39:46.509
and fall onto the spatula,
causing the pulley to be activated.

39:47.134 --> 39:49.261
Everything pretty much is edible.

39:49.929 --> 39:50.763
You ready?

39:50.846 --> 39:51.889
-I guess so.
-[Justin] Okay.

39:51.972 --> 39:54.058
[dramatic music playing]

40:00.356 --> 40:03.192
-[Andrew gasps]
-Ooh! So close, so close.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.613
-[Shanice whispers] Okay.
-[Joanne] Close.

40:07.696 --> 40:08.906
So close. What happened?

40:08.989 --> 40:12.493
Our isomalt balls are starting to get
really, like, tacky.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.995
We didn't test it
as much as we should've either. So…

40:15.496 --> 40:17.540
I think we didn't test it at all.

40:19.959 --> 40:21.168
Why didn't you test it?

40:21.252 --> 40:23.587
We just didn't have
a ton of time to test it.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.300
Well, Vanessa, Shanice,

40:28.384 --> 40:31.345
do you wanna kind of
pick up where your machine left off?

40:31.429 --> 40:34.765
So, our ball would have fallen here

40:34.849 --> 40:38.727
and nudged this
and would've done something like this,

40:38.811 --> 40:40.438
-and opened.
-[Joanne] Oh!

40:40.521 --> 40:42.356
-[Vanessa] Our cake's in there.
-[Justin] It is.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.525
-And our window opened.
-[all exclaim]

40:44.608 --> 40:45.609
[Joanne] Yeah!

40:45.693 --> 40:49.155
All right. Will you slice that up
and serve the judges?

40:50.239 --> 40:53.451
[Vanessa] I wanted to do something
that brought us back to the 1950s.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.786
I went for a strawberry shortcake

40:55.870 --> 40:58.289
with a whipped cream frosting.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.500
I think one of the risks

41:01.584 --> 41:04.545
in making a dessert that is iconic

41:04.628 --> 41:08.841
is that everybody has an idea
of what an ideal strawberry shortcake is.

41:08.924 --> 41:11.969
-[Vanessa] Right.
-So you have to knock it out of the park.

41:12.052 --> 41:14.472
-I don't think I've ever tried one before.
-[Joanne] Really?

41:14.555 --> 41:17.099
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-If you haven't tried one before,

41:17.183 --> 41:19.560
I'm curious as to why you decided
to bake one for us

41:19.643 --> 41:22.396
for your big dramatic revealing dessert.

41:24.064 --> 41:27.067
The cream is light and very flavorful.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.236
I like that there's
a little bit of citrus.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.490
This is a little bit denser
than I'd expect a strawberry shortcake.

41:32.573 --> 41:33.407
Yes.

41:33.491 --> 41:37.745
I think you took a really big risk
trying something you haven't done before,

41:37.828 --> 41:40.206
and while components of it are tasty,

41:40.915 --> 41:43.751
it doesn't work for me as a whole
as a strawberry shortcake.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.753
I understand. [chuckles nervously]

41:45.836 --> 41:48.964
Vanessa and Shanice, I really like this.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.342
You've gone for quite a clean design,

41:51.425 --> 41:54.220
and everything I look at,
I can see edible.

41:54.720 --> 41:58.265
It was maybe just a few elements
where you could've had a little barrier,

41:58.349 --> 42:00.392
perhaps at the end
of the gingerbread shelves,

42:00.476 --> 42:03.270
to make sure things go
into the right place.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.981
You stretched yourselves today,
so I applaud you for that.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.191
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

42:07.274 --> 42:10.486
Please, let this mission
be a learning lesson for you.

42:10.569 --> 42:12.071
If you move forward,

42:12.154 --> 42:15.991
-you have to test as you build.
-[Shanice] Mm-hmm.

42:16.075 --> 42:17.785
-All along.
-I agree.

42:18.577 --> 42:20.704
Vanessa, Shanice, you can head back.

42:24.875 --> 42:27.253
Judges, you've got
some deliberating to do.

42:27.336 --> 42:30.214
We'll give you a little privacy.
I'll hang with the bakineers.

42:30.297 --> 42:31.507
[dramatic music playing]

42:33.801 --> 42:35.719
[Joey] We've almost been
eliminated twice.

42:35.803 --> 42:38.889
I'm feeling incredibly confident
that we will not be,

42:38.973 --> 42:42.393
but judges did mention
the outside crust was a little overcooked.

42:42.476 --> 42:44.270
I'm worried that that could hurt us.

42:45.729 --> 42:48.357
[dramatic music playing]

42:57.408 --> 42:58.409
Bakineers.

42:59.451 --> 43:02.871
The action here today was kinetic.

43:02.955 --> 43:05.833
Some of your machines worked flawlessly.

43:06.458 --> 43:09.545
While others might have busted a chain.

43:11.547 --> 43:14.550
But first, let's get into the good news.

43:14.633 --> 43:15.718
Rodolfo and Sara.

43:17.136 --> 43:18.929
Joey and Mario.

43:19.513 --> 43:23.517
Congratulations.
You are the top two teams in this mission.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.394
Rodolfo and Sara,

43:25.477 --> 43:29.815
I loved your use of both edible
and inedible items from the pantry.

43:29.898 --> 43:32.818
We were really impressed
with your final dessert,

43:32.901 --> 43:35.070
especially that illusion at the end.

43:35.654 --> 43:39.158
Joey and Mario, there was a lot of detail
to delight the eye,

43:39.241 --> 43:41.785
and you showed
some really good engineering today.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.163
I also really enjoyed your cheesecake

43:44.246 --> 43:46.123
and the fusion of cultures you showed us.

43:48.042 --> 43:49.418
Without further ado,

43:50.294 --> 43:53.714
the winning team today is…

43:57.593 --> 43:59.094
[whimsical music playing]

44:00.262 --> 44:03.307
See, this is a little machine
I've been busy making,

44:03.390 --> 44:07.394
and I would love to show you what it does,
but I need a magic rope.

44:07.936 --> 44:08.771
[snaps]

44:09.688 --> 44:11.106
[contestants chuckling]

44:12.691 --> 44:13.525
Oh.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.569
[all laugh]

44:15.653 --> 44:17.655
Magic rope. Should I pull it?

44:17.738 --> 44:19.990
-[all] Yeah!
-[Andrew] Go for it.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.618
[dramatic music playing]

44:33.712 --> 44:35.214
[upbeat music playing]

44:35.297 --> 44:36.924
[all cheering and applauding]

44:39.468 --> 44:40.886
Ta-da!

44:40.969 --> 44:43.138
-[Sara and Rodolfo laugh]
-How do you guys feel?

44:43.222 --> 44:45.432
-Relieved.
-Relieved. [laughs]

44:45.516 --> 44:48.894
You guys engineered your creation
to a tee.

44:48.977 --> 44:51.814
You took the energy
from the bottom to the top,

44:51.897 --> 44:55.109
and that took you to the top.
Congratulations.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.071
So, that leaves us with you five teams.

44:59.738 --> 45:02.533
Cindy and Taylor, Randi and Jacob.

45:04.493 --> 45:06.370
Congrats, you guys are safe.

45:07.996 --> 45:09.581
Steve and Renee.

45:10.666 --> 45:11.875
Brandi and Menuka.

45:12.751 --> 45:14.253
Vanessa and Shanice.

45:14.336 --> 45:18.006
One of you will have faced
their last mission in this workshop.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.884
Steve and Renee, you impressed me

45:20.968 --> 45:24.054
with one of the most beautiful pieces
I've seen made in this kitchen.

45:24.722 --> 45:28.475
After the last mission, I told you, Renee,
that I was beginning to see a trend.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.644
Well now, we hit time number three,

45:30.728 --> 45:33.230
and our engineering failed again today.

45:34.356 --> 45:37.443
So, Renee, you have to pick it up
if you're gonna continue.

45:38.777 --> 45:40.279
Vanessa and Shanice,

45:40.362 --> 45:44.199
there are so many parts
of both your design and your baking

45:44.283 --> 45:45.743
that I really love.

45:45.826 --> 45:48.996
But the fondant work
was a little bit messy

45:49.079 --> 45:52.291
and the strawberry shortcake
was a lot denser and heavier

45:52.374 --> 45:54.418
than I expect
in a great strawberry shortcake.

45:55.544 --> 45:59.006
Brandi and Menuka,
I think you were overambitious today

45:59.089 --> 46:00.507
in how much you took on.

46:00.591 --> 46:04.845
And whilst I enjoyed some elements,
I think there was too much going on.

46:12.186 --> 46:13.520
I'm sorry to say…

46:15.689 --> 46:19.693
Vanessa and Shanice,
today was your final mission.

46:20.486 --> 46:22.863
Thank you guys so much. Good luck, guys.

46:22.946 --> 46:24.531
-[all applauding]
-Good luck!

46:25.032 --> 46:26.742
[Vanessa] This opportunity
was huge for me.

46:26.825 --> 46:29.620
I'm still taking so much from it,
but I just--

46:29.703 --> 46:31.663
I wish I was able to make it further.

46:31.747 --> 46:33.665
I really wanted to…

46:33.749 --> 46:35.083
[sniffles]

46:35.167 --> 46:36.001
…show more.

46:37.211 --> 46:40.088
[Shanice] Though we didn't get as far
in the competition as we wanted to,

46:40.172 --> 46:44.551
I think we really did learn a lot
getting to this point, you know?

46:44.635 --> 46:47.137
And this experience has changed my life.

46:52.643 --> 46:56.772
Well, what do you guys say?
Wanna take a swing at the next mission?

46:58.023 --> 47:01.068
I don't wanna
club you over the head with it,

47:01.151 --> 47:03.987
but, uh, we're talking about
a golf mission.

47:05.322 --> 47:07.741
Andrew, everyone knows
mini golf is a team sport.

47:08.325 --> 47:09.451
Yeah, of course.

47:09.535 --> 47:13.038
-It's not a team sport. But it is today.
-[mouthing words]

47:13.121 --> 47:14.581
So, for this mission,

47:15.165 --> 47:17.209
you'll be working in two teams.

47:18.085 --> 47:21.797
We'll have the Green Team,
which is this side of the workshop.

47:21.880 --> 47:24.091
Rodolfo and Sara, Brandi and Menuka,

47:24.174 --> 47:25.759
and Joey and Mario.

47:26.343 --> 47:29.847
And then we'll have the Yellow Team,
the other side of the workshop.

47:29.930 --> 47:32.057
Cindy and Taylor, Randi and Jacob,

47:32.140 --> 47:33.475
and Steve and Renee.

47:34.059 --> 47:38.438
You guys ready for an action-packed round
of mini golf-themed bakineering?

47:38.522 --> 47:39.898
[all] Yeah!

47:39.982 --> 47:41.275
[Justin] Well, let's do it!

47:41.358 --> 47:42.901
[upbeat music playing]

47:42.985 --> 47:47.406
[female announcer]
Mission launch in three, two, one.

47:47.489 --> 47:48.532
-Go.
-Go.

47:49.491 --> 47:51.243
Golf clap for encouragement.

47:51.326 --> 47:53.579
