WEBVTT

00:02.159 --> 00:04.260
Hey, great promotion, Mike.

00:04.328 --> 00:06.162
Let Outdoor Man
crush your old boat

00:06.230 --> 00:08.197
and get a $1,000 credit
toward your new one.

00:08.265 --> 00:10.232
Yeah. The only thing
better than selling boats

00:10.299 --> 00:13.735
is watching one being crushed by a
16-ton killing machine. (Laughs)

00:13.802 --> 00:17.705
(Roaring and rattling)

00:19.509 --> 00:22.310
(Crowd cheering)

00:22.378 --> 00:24.879
(Crowd applauding and whooping)

00:29.384 --> 00:31.918
Man, that tank is crazy cool.

00:31.986 --> 00:33.754
I love tanks. Ever since
I was a little kid,

00:33.821 --> 00:35.556
I wanted to be
a tank commander.

00:35.624 --> 00:37.691
Is that why you're always
in a bad mood?

00:37.759 --> 00:39.560
Partially.

00:41.296 --> 00:43.496
Do you know what would be funny?
If one of you guys bought it.

00:43.564 --> 00:47.033
Don't be ridiculous, Kyle.
Who'd buy a tank?

00:47.100 --> 00:49.935
I did.

00:50.003 --> 00:52.272
Seriously?
That? It's yours?

00:52.339 --> 00:54.174
Are you sure this is
a good idea?

00:54.241 --> 00:55.608
You can't drive it
on city streets,

00:55.676 --> 00:56.976
and you'd need to--

00:57.044 --> 00:58.977
To rent a space in a hangar
to-- to store it, and--

00:59.045 --> 01:01.079
Very good points.
On the other hand,

01:01.147 --> 01:03.882
it <i>is</i> a freakin' tank.
(Laughs)

01:05.685 --> 01:09.388

01:12.058 --> 01:14.625
Okay, great.
We'll see you then.

01:14.693 --> 01:16.827
(Cell phone beeps) (Chuckles) Evie,
set another place at the table.

01:16.895 --> 01:18.496
Your aunt April's
coming in from Boulder.

01:18.564 --> 01:21.632
- Yay!
- Does dad know?

01:21.700 --> 01:24.669
What kind of question is that?
He loves your aunt April.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.870
He calls her
"The Devil's Party Guest."

01:28.907 --> 01:30.273
I love Aunt April.

01:30.341 --> 01:32.509
She's proof that you can
grow up and still be fun.

01:32.577 --> 01:34.244
I'm still fun!

01:34.312 --> 01:35.712
Okay.

01:37.548 --> 01:40.650
Hi.

01:40.718 --> 01:41.851
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:41.919 --> 01:43.086
(Chuckles)

01:43.153 --> 01:44.787
How was your day?

01:44.855 --> 01:46.255
(Chuckles) Great.
Actually a great day. Hey.

01:46.323 --> 01:47.323
Mm.

01:47.390 --> 01:48.624
Aunt April's coming over.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.392
And that's the end of that.

01:50.460 --> 01:52.428
(Chuckles)

01:52.495 --> 01:54.263
There's only one reason
why Aunt April comes here

01:54.331 --> 01:55.997
from the People's Republic
of Boulder.

01:56.065 --> 01:57.433
Mike.

01:57.500 --> 01:58.867
I'm sorry, but she just
comes here to borrow money.

01:58.935 --> 02:00.035
It's embarrassing.

02:00.103 --> 02:01.937
(Doorbell rings repeatedly) Oh!

02:02.004 --> 02:05.306
(Ringing continues) Even her doorbell
ring sounds like it needs money.

02:05.374 --> 02:08.042
(Singsongy) I let myself in!
(Screams)

02:08.110 --> 02:09.210
- Girls!
- Hi!

02:09.277 --> 02:10.945
- Oh, and more girls!
(Both, flatly) - Hi.

02:11.012 --> 02:13.013
(Makes kissing sounds)
And my favorite girl!

02:13.081 --> 02:14.215
Oh, ho, ho!
(Laughs)

02:14.283 --> 02:15.816
And where's the boy?

02:15.884 --> 02:17.652
- Here we go. Hi.
- There he is!

02:17.720 --> 02:19.253
Aah!

02:19.320 --> 02:21.688
Let me go! (Chuckles)

02:21.756 --> 02:24.524
Oh, my sides are splitting.

02:24.592 --> 02:26.727
It's funny every time.

02:26.794 --> 02:28.795
Ohh... ohh.

02:28.863 --> 02:31.732
Mike, are you okay?

02:31.799 --> 02:32.832
Yeah, yeah, I'm great.

02:32.900 --> 02:35.368
Whenever I see you,
you look stressed.

02:35.435 --> 02:37.970
- You know...
- You know what you need?

02:38.037 --> 02:39.805
Magnetic rocks!

02:39.873 --> 02:42.841
They will just suck the toxins
right out of you.

02:42.909 --> 02:44.943
You know, I actually
like my toxins.

02:45.011 --> 02:48.013
Like a good cheese--
It's what binds me together.

02:48.081 --> 02:51.015
Oh, my God, Aunt April,
I love your shoes!

02:51.083 --> 02:53.084
- Aren't they-- - I've seen them
on two of the real housewives!

02:53.152 --> 02:55.153
Aren't they great?
I just bought 'em.

02:55.220 --> 02:56.921
<i>We</i> just bought them.

02:56.989 --> 02:58.323
Okay.

02:58.391 --> 03:00.292
How are you guys doing?

03:00.359 --> 03:01.693
We're good.
And Boyd is great.

03:01.761 --> 03:03.194
(Chuckling) Actually,
it's a really funny story.

03:03.262 --> 03:04.896
- So--
- My life's a mess! Aunt April,

03:04.963 --> 03:06.764
you're kind of
an expert on dating, right?

03:06.831 --> 03:08.599
I know my way around
a cruise ship,

03:08.667 --> 03:10.768
if that's what you're asking.

03:10.835 --> 03:12.536
See, there's this--
There's this new guy

03:12.604 --> 03:15.572
at my coffee shop, but he
doesn't seem to know I'm alive.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.008
- Ohh. Get his number.
- Okay.

03:18.075 --> 03:22.179
And then call and call
and call and call.

03:22.246 --> 03:26.683
Yeah, men need to know that
you're not going <i>anywhere.</i>

03:26.750 --> 03:29.152
It's the key
to a healthy relationship.

03:30.387 --> 03:33.589
Hmm. I feel like it's not.

03:33.657 --> 03:36.993
Well, April, we're all
richer for your advice.

03:37.061 --> 03:39.394
And only for your advice.

03:39.462 --> 03:42.832
Ooh! Hey! That reminds me!

03:42.899 --> 03:44.333
(Singsongy) Ta-da!

03:44.400 --> 03:45.801
What's this?

03:45.869 --> 03:47.736
Just a little something
I owe you.

03:47.804 --> 03:49.671
I'm repaying your loan.

03:49.739 --> 03:51.606
(Clicks tongue) Thank you.
(Chuckles)

03:51.674 --> 03:55.944
Well, this certainly isn't
"money down a <i>rat hole."</i>

04:02.885 --> 04:04.853
(Kyle) - Hey.
(Kristin) - Hi.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.620
- You ready?
- Uh, for what?

04:06.688 --> 04:08.223
Our date.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.325
I got us tickets to that band
I was telling you about--

04:10.392 --> 04:12.525
Crouch Potato.

04:12.593 --> 04:14.594
Apparently it started
as a typo, and...

04:14.662 --> 04:17.231
(Makes whooshing sound)

04:17.298 --> 04:19.399
I'm so sorry.
I totally forgot,

04:19.466 --> 04:22.002
and I have three more
chapters to outline.

04:22.070 --> 04:23.337
You know what?
That's cool.

04:23.404 --> 04:24.905
They're not that great,
anyways.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.039
And people throw potatoes
at them. It's kinda dangerous.

04:28.842 --> 04:29.876
What are you studying?

04:29.943 --> 04:31.543
Oh. Um, cell division.

04:31.611 --> 04:33.779
Actually, there's all of these
really amazing new theories

04:33.847 --> 04:35.248
about how stem cells work.

04:35.315 --> 04:37.583
Oh. Right on.

04:37.650 --> 04:39.051
Yeah. (Chuckles)
Okay, so...

04:39.119 --> 04:40.819
There are these proteins
that actually boost

04:40.888 --> 04:42.388
the immunity of host cells
against...

04:42.455 --> 04:44.256
<i>(Thinking) Why would she think</i>
<i>this would interest me?</i>

04:44.323 --> 04:47.392
(Speaking indistinctly)
<i>I mean, she is awesome,</i>

04:47.459 --> 04:49.694
<i>but I feel like</i>
<i>we're drifting apart.</i>

04:49.762 --> 04:52.130
So...

04:52.198 --> 04:53.798
How was your day?

04:53.866 --> 04:55.700
It was good.
(Chuckles)

04:55.768 --> 04:58.603
Today we got in a shipment
of 3D boat radar,

04:58.670 --> 05:00.004
- and me and the guys...
<i>(Thinking, scoffs) - He's a great guy,</i>

05:00.071 --> 05:01.605
<i>and he means well,</i>

05:01.672 --> 05:03.941
<i>but I don't think</i>
<i>he listens to me anymore.</i>

05:04.009 --> 05:06.877
(Speaking inaudibly)

05:06.945 --> 05:09.914
<i>In fairness, I'm not</i>
<i>listening to him either.</i>

05:09.981 --> 05:11.382
...but it didn't matter,
because this thing runs

05:11.449 --> 05:14.418
on a 900-megahertz signal that
can pinpoint a channel marker

05:14.485 --> 05:16.419
at 24 nautical miles.

05:16.486 --> 05:18.754
<i>(Thinking) I sort of think</i>
<i>we should break up, but...</i>

05:18.822 --> 05:20.723
<i>Oh, I don't want</i>
<i>to hurt his feelings.</i>

05:20.791 --> 05:23.192
After that, we spent
the rest of our lunch break

05:23.260 --> 05:25.428
playing hide-and-seek
in the warehouse.

05:27.097 --> 05:29.399
That's pretty cool, huh?

05:29.466 --> 05:30.400
Hmm?

05:30.467 --> 05:31.967
Wha-- Oh, yeah.

05:32.035 --> 05:33.735
(Chuckling) Yeah. Yeah.

05:33.803 --> 05:35.703
Um, actually, my professor said

05:35.771 --> 05:37.439
something really
interesting today. Um--

05:37.506 --> 05:38.840
I think we should break up,

05:38.908 --> 05:40.842
but I don't want
to hurt her feelings.

05:40.910 --> 05:42.945
What?

05:45.781 --> 05:48.482
That was supposed to be
a thought.

05:52.687 --> 05:54.989
You know, it occurs to me

05:55.057 --> 05:58.826
that someone still owes me
an apology.

05:58.893 --> 06:00.661
Well, I'm sorry...

06:00.728 --> 06:03.296
You feel you need an apology.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.002
Because you ain't gettin' one.

06:09.070 --> 06:10.937
Yeah, you just can't deal
with the fact

06:11.005 --> 06:12.872
that my sister paid us back.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.975
From what bank, the bank
of wishful thinking?

06:16.710 --> 06:18.678
It's a cashier's check
from Boulder National.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.545
- You can look for yourself.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.147
- $3,000?
- Mm-hmm.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.583
Apology accepted.

06:24.650 --> 06:25.917
You loaned her 3 grand?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.119
Yeah. That's a chunk of it.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.687
A chunk of it?!

06:28.754 --> 06:30.990
How much money
did you loan her?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.657
You know what?
Let's just focus

06:32.725 --> 06:35.360
on the apology and the check.

06:35.427 --> 06:36.961
I'm way past that.

06:37.029 --> 06:38.696
I can't believe you loaned her
this much money.

06:38.763 --> 06:40.698
- You didn't ask me.
- Well, it was in dribs and drabs--

06:40.765 --> 06:42.600
A hundred here,
a few hundred there.

06:42.667 --> 06:45.136
It's-- it's not like
I handed her a lump sum.

06:45.204 --> 06:46.804
This is a pretty big lump.

06:48.740 --> 06:51.074
I was okay paying
for her dental hygienist school.

06:51.142 --> 06:52.442
That turned out to be a bust.

06:52.510 --> 06:55.578
How could we know that
tongues would gross her out?

06:55.646 --> 06:58.048
I also paid
for court reporter school,

06:58.116 --> 07:00.317
which she just used
to meet attorneys, right?

07:00.385 --> 07:02.719
Well, some of whom were
very nice. Remember Neil?

07:02.786 --> 07:04.954
I remember he was married.

07:05.023 --> 07:07.589
We have to be smarter
with the money,

07:07.657 --> 07:09.025
especially when it comes
to April.

07:09.092 --> 07:11.027
(Knock on door) Yeah?

07:11.094 --> 07:12.561
Hey, dad,
there's a guy on the phone.

07:12.629 --> 07:14.897
He wants to know where you
want him to deliver your tank.

07:14.964 --> 07:17.599
Just a sec.

07:20.003 --> 07:21.470
I bought a tank.

07:23.006 --> 07:25.373
I told you, remember?

07:33.159 --> 07:34.760
(Telephone beeps)
You bought a <i>what?</i>

07:34.827 --> 07:36.961
I bought a tank!

07:39.364 --> 07:42.866
A fish tank?
A-a-a gas tank?

07:42.934 --> 07:45.503
A tank top? Wh-what...

07:45.570 --> 07:47.305
No, a British Army tank.

07:47.372 --> 07:49.273
Actually,
it's a self-propelled howitzer.

07:49.341 --> 07:51.709
It's great! I got the specs,
you wanna see?

07:51.777 --> 07:55.012
I don't want to see the specs!
Who cares about the specs?

07:55.079 --> 07:56.680
You know I've been wanting
to buy a tank forever.

07:56.747 --> 07:58.581
Yeah, but I-I didn't--
I didn't think you were serious.

07:58.649 --> 08:01.884
That's why I laughed.
Laughed.

08:01.952 --> 08:04.487
How come you're not
laughing now?

08:04.555 --> 08:06.155
Yeah, but what-- what-- what--

08:06.223 --> 08:07.791
What, are you gonna
drive a tank around town?

08:07.858 --> 08:09.626
Don't be silly. You can't
drive tanks around town.

08:09.694 --> 08:12.494
They don't have
turn indicators.

08:12.562 --> 08:14.863
Well, great, great.
So you're-- you're just gonna

08:14.931 --> 08:16.898
park it in our driveway
like an eyesore?

08:16.966 --> 08:19.000
You know, I wanted
to plant azaleas,

08:19.068 --> 08:21.203
and you were so against it,
because you thought

08:21.270 --> 08:23.572
they would make our yard
look "too busy."

08:23.640 --> 08:25.106
I'm not gonna park it here.

08:25.174 --> 08:27.108
You can't park military
equipment in suburban places.

08:27.176 --> 08:28.443
I got a warehouse for it.

08:28.510 --> 08:30.110
Basically, you have bought

08:30.178 --> 08:33.214
the world's
largest paperweight.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.283
That can crush boats.

08:36.352 --> 08:38.284
(Switch clicks) And y-you had--
You had the nerve

08:38.354 --> 08:40.888
to give me grief about
loaning my sister money?

08:40.956 --> 08:42.923
Listen, if we had the money
that you loaned your sister,

08:42.991 --> 08:44.190
I could have bought the tank

08:44.258 --> 08:46.259
<i>and</i> an armored
personnel carrier.

08:46.327 --> 08:48.762
No, no. That's not true.

08:48.830 --> 08:50.564
Listen, this is
a tangible item.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.532
You can touch it.
You can feel it. (Sighs)

08:52.600 --> 08:54.133
You can drive it
with your shirt off,

08:54.201 --> 08:56.870
pretend you're chasing Rommel
across North Africa.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.743
How much did it cost?

09:07.947 --> 09:10.383
If you go by the pound,
it's less than cereal.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.584
(Switch clicks)

09:11.651 --> 09:14.720
(Groans and sighs)
Mike, just...

09:14.788 --> 09:17.189
That was my money, too.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.457
<i>Well...</i>

09:22.595 --> 09:26.331
<i>"Well..."?</i>

09:26.399 --> 09:27.966
- You make money...
- Yeah.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.667
And I make money.
(Gasps)

09:29.735 --> 09:33.037
- What?! Wha-- What are you saying?
- Now let's not--

09:33.105 --> 09:35.206
- I don't want to argue about money.
- I don't want to argue about money, either.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.607
- Let's not argue-- let's not argue about--
- What are you talking about?

09:36.674 --> 09:38.142
All right, stop for a minute,
stop for a minute.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.044
- Let's say I was paid in kidney beans.
- Yeah.

09:40.112 --> 09:44.615
I would need a significantly
larger jar to hold my beans.

09:44.682 --> 09:47.218
And around here at Baxter
International Bean Sales,

09:47.286 --> 09:50.153
I hold 70% of the assets.

09:50.221 --> 09:51.788
(Switch clicks)

09:51.855 --> 09:54.590
You know what else
you're gonna be holdin'?

09:59.263 --> 10:00.997
(Blows raspberry)

10:02.366 --> 10:05.534
It always comes back to that!

10:09.072 --> 10:10.906
Hey, Mike Baxter
for Outdoor Man.

10:10.974 --> 10:12.741
I've got a great promotion
for you.

10:12.809 --> 10:15.811
For the next 500 customers
that come into Outdoor Man,

10:15.878 --> 10:18.547
you get a free rod and reel
and all the ammo you can carry.

10:18.614 --> 10:21.416
Huh? The big news is--

10:21.483 --> 10:24.419
We're not doing that.
That would be stupid!

10:24.486 --> 10:26.754
You can't give away free stuff.

10:26.822 --> 10:28.256
Free stuff?

10:28.324 --> 10:30.358
Whoever said, "The best things
in life are free"

10:30.426 --> 10:32.994
needs a head examination.

10:33.062 --> 10:34.429
I'll give you an example.

10:34.496 --> 10:36.096
You put a deer feeder
near your cabin,

10:36.164 --> 10:37.397
and pretty soon, the deer--

10:37.465 --> 10:38.999
They don't know how to get
their own food!

10:39.067 --> 10:40.733
Why would they get
their own food

10:40.801 --> 10:42.269
if they're just gonna stick
their hooves up at my house--

10:42.337 --> 10:44.838
"Where's the food?!"

10:44.905 --> 10:46.806
In an effort to get them
back on track,

10:46.874 --> 10:48.375
I removed the deer feeder.

10:48.443 --> 10:51.044
Did they appreciate that?
Oh, I don't think so.

10:51.112 --> 10:53.512
Have you ever seen a deer
spit at you?

10:53.580 --> 10:55.181
Well, that's what happened
to me.

10:55.248 --> 10:57.316
I go out there,
they're all unwashed,

10:57.384 --> 10:59.452
pooping all over the--
The lawn there,

10:59.519 --> 11:01.920
carrying big signs--
"Occupy Denver."

11:03.523 --> 11:05.624
And that's hard to do,
'cause they're--

11:05.692 --> 11:08.693
They don't have
opposable thumbs.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.196
And for the rest of you,
bring your <i>dough--</i>

11:11.263 --> 11:12.897
And your <i>bucks--</i>

11:12.965 --> 11:14.799
And come down to Outdoor Man.

11:14.867 --> 11:16.701
It's our bass fishin'
boat sale.

11:16.768 --> 11:19.570
See you later. Buh-bye.

11:23.742 --> 11:26.843
(Door opens)

11:28.480 --> 11:29.946
What are you doing here?

11:30.015 --> 11:32.716
Sorry. I just needed
a place to think.

11:32.783 --> 11:34.918
Hmm. All right.
Sit. Sit down.

11:37.222 --> 11:40.689
So... (Clearing throat)
What's up?

11:40.757 --> 11:43.692
Well, Kristin and I
sort of ended things.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.395
Oh.

11:45.462 --> 11:47.463
You poor kid.

11:47.531 --> 11:51.100
Well, we both knew she was
out of your league, so...

11:55.906 --> 11:58.540
- No, it was pretty mutual.
- Ah.

11:58.607 --> 12:00.842
But way to pile on.
(Chuckles)

12:00.910 --> 12:02.977
Okay. Come on.

12:03.046 --> 12:06.448
If it was mutual,
what's the problem?

12:06.516 --> 12:08.616
I don't know how to tell
Mr. B.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.652
Do you think he'll be mad?

12:10.719 --> 12:12.753
Look, one thing I've learned
from working with Mike Baxter--

12:12.820 --> 12:14.555
Expect the unexpected.

12:16.224 --> 12:18.792
I'm just nervous. I don't
want to disappoint him.

12:18.860 --> 12:21.929
Yeah, well, prepare
for the un-preparable.

12:24.832 --> 12:26.167
Do you know
I'm the first boyfriend

12:26.234 --> 12:28.201
they've ever invited over
for Christmas dinner?

12:28.269 --> 12:31.771
Mm-hmm. Kyle, you have to
tell the truth to Mike.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.639
Yeah, even if you suffer
for it.

12:33.707 --> 12:35.041
- I guess.
- Yeah.

12:35.109 --> 12:36.809
And follow this
simple advice--

12:36.877 --> 12:40.447
Anticipate
the un-anticipatable.

12:44.484 --> 12:46.485
Well, that is simple.

12:46.553 --> 12:48.019
And I'm not sure that's advice.

12:52.492 --> 12:54.426
Hey, where's your mom?

12:54.494 --> 12:55.994
- She's not back from work yet.
- Yeah.

12:56.062 --> 12:58.663
Ohh. She works too hard.
She always did.

12:58.731 --> 13:01.165
Let that be a lesson to you.

13:02.601 --> 13:05.536
Uh... a good lesson?

13:05.604 --> 13:07.505
So...
Yeah.

13:07.573 --> 13:08.872
What's happening
with coffee boy?

13:08.940 --> 13:10.608
Have you trapped him yet?

13:10.675 --> 13:13.177
Almost. We are going
on our first date tonight.

13:13.245 --> 13:15.946
(Both squeal and laugh)

13:16.014 --> 13:17.714
Okay, quick tip--

13:17.781 --> 13:19.749
If he is quiet
for even a second...

13:19.817 --> 13:22.452
Ask him what's wrong.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.287
And try to hug him
while he's driving.

13:24.355 --> 13:26.523
Men <i>love</i> that!

13:28.226 --> 13:29.593
Hey, ladies! I--

13:29.660 --> 13:32.294
- Hey, sis! Hey!
- Hi!

13:32.362 --> 13:35.431
Girls, you will never have
a better friend

13:35.499 --> 13:37.199
than your own sister.

13:37.267 --> 13:39.835
(Clicks tongue)

13:39.902 --> 13:43.005
Why do I feel like you just
put a curse on me?

13:45.808 --> 13:48.143
So...

13:48.210 --> 13:50.811
What are you doing here
the second time in a week?

13:50.879 --> 13:53.181
(Speaks indistinctly)
Can't I just miss my big sis?

13:53.249 --> 13:55.183
Not when I just saw you
two days ago.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.552
Oh, please tell me you're
here to give me more money.

13:57.620 --> 14:00.921
Kind of.

14:00.989 --> 14:03.391
But like the opposite of that.

14:04.659 --> 14:06.326
What-- what--
What happened?

14:06.394 --> 14:07.927
Oh, nothing happened.

14:07.995 --> 14:09.630
I just had this
great opportunity

14:09.697 --> 14:12.266
to invest
in a new startup business.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.967
Oh, honey, I don't know.
I don't--

14:14.035 --> 14:15.402
I just-- I don't think
it's a good time

14:15.470 --> 14:16.603
for us to be loaning you money.

14:16.671 --> 14:17.937
But it's not that much!

14:18.005 --> 14:20.540
It's barely more
than I just paid you back,

14:20.607 --> 14:23.442
so it's kind of like
you're breaking even.

14:23.510 --> 14:27.647
I-I'm not seeing it
that way.

14:27.714 --> 14:30.283
- Okay, well, hear the idea.
- All right.

14:30.350 --> 14:31.584
- All right?
- Go ahead. Yeah.

14:31.652 --> 14:35.254
It's a laundromat
and a breakfast joint,

14:35.322 --> 14:38.022
and they're gonna call it
Wash and Nosh.

14:40.125 --> 14:41.526
Okay.

14:41.594 --> 14:43.628
Right? So you do
your own laundry...

14:43.696 --> 14:46.030
And then you eat
between cycles.

14:47.466 --> 14:49.701
Okay, listen.
When I first heard it,

14:49.768 --> 14:52.203
- I was like, "that's crazy."
- Yeah.

14:52.270 --> 14:54.805
But then...

14:54.872 --> 14:58.576
I remembered all the times
I'm doing laundry,

14:58.643 --> 15:01.679
and I'm like, "I'm hungry."

15:01.746 --> 15:05.216
You know, April,
I just-- I'm not--

15:05.283 --> 15:08.685
(gasps) You know what?
I get hungry then, too.

15:08.752 --> 15:12.054
<i>Right?</i> And then
if you spill something...

15:12.122 --> 15:14.090
- Right, well, you just put it
in the machine. - Yeah!

15:14.157 --> 15:15.491
Wow.
(Shrieks)

15:15.559 --> 15:17.392
Yeah, you know, it does--
it kinda makes sense.

15:17.460 --> 15:18.728
(Gasps)
But--

15:18.795 --> 15:21.463
- Yay!
- Oh!

15:26.036 --> 15:27.403
Pretty good, huh?

15:27.471 --> 15:29.839
- Wash and Nosh?
- Yeah,

15:29.906 --> 15:32.675
or Nosh and Wash.
You know, customer's choice.

15:32.743 --> 15:35.578
(Chuckles) That-- that-- that's,
uh, how great the idea is.

15:35.646 --> 15:37.112
But even after our discussion
last night,

15:37.180 --> 15:38.714
you still want
to loan her money?

15:38.781 --> 15:40.682
April's my sister.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.385
That would be the answer
to the question,

15:43.453 --> 15:45.554
"how do you know April?"

15:45.621 --> 15:48.257
I know. I know. I just--
Every time I took at her,

15:48.325 --> 15:50.492
I just see this
6-year-old kid

15:50.560 --> 15:52.627
that I helped raise,
and I--

15:52.695 --> 15:56.264
I guess I just...
I can't shake the feeling.

15:56.332 --> 15:58.299
I know, but it's not
doing her any good.

15:58.367 --> 16:00.935
- She needs me.
- Would you do this for our kids?

16:01.003 --> 16:02.337
I mean, would you do
their homework for 'em?

16:02.404 --> 16:03.872
No. No.

16:03.939 --> 16:05.606
I mean, do we pick up the room
and wash their clothes?

16:05.674 --> 16:09.209
Well, you don't.

16:09.277 --> 16:11.778
You know how upset you get
when we go to the science fair,

16:11.846 --> 16:13.646
and the other parents
do the work for the kids?

16:13.714 --> 16:15.249
(Chuckles) Oh, yeah.

16:15.316 --> 16:17.284
An 11-year-old kid can't even
tie his own shoelaces,

16:17.352 --> 16:19.819
<i>but</i> he can make an exact
replica of the Tesla coil.

16:19.888 --> 16:21.654
(Inhales and groans)

16:27.261 --> 16:30.829
Okay. Okay. All right, well...
(Slaps thighs)

16:30.898 --> 16:33.532
I will get the money
back from her.

16:39.006 --> 16:42.540
This is the least satisfying
argument I've ever won.

16:45.744 --> 16:46.945
(Knock on wall)

16:47.013 --> 16:50.581
Mike, I'm gonna apologize
in advance

16:50.649 --> 16:53.018
if the tank smells like
limburger cheese.

16:55.187 --> 16:58.188
I got it as a gift.

16:58.256 --> 17:00.457
Why don't you just
eat it in your office?

17:00.525 --> 17:03.160
What, and stink up my office?
What--

17:05.396 --> 17:07.497
What's wrong, Mike?

17:08.633 --> 17:10.434
You look a little down.

17:10.501 --> 17:12.935
(Mouth full) Vanessa's really
upset about her sister.

17:13.002 --> 17:14.670
But I know I'm doing
the right thing.

17:14.738 --> 17:16.472
Well, then what's the problem?

17:16.540 --> 17:18.741
I don't like it
when my wife is upset.

17:18.809 --> 17:21.277
(Crunching)

17:21.345 --> 17:23.746
One thing that four divorces
has taught me--

17:23.814 --> 17:26.082
Other than the value
of a pre-nup--

17:26.150 --> 17:27.782
In a relationship,
doing the right thing

17:27.851 --> 17:30.419
doesn't always
make it right. Hmm?

17:31.754 --> 17:33.755
<i>Okay.</i>

17:40.063 --> 17:42.931
(Knock on wall) Jeez, this
place is like a train station.

17:42.999 --> 17:44.866
I know you're busy,
but could I have a moment?

17:44.934 --> 17:46.167
All right.

17:46.234 --> 17:48.302
It's about my relationship
with Kristin.

17:48.370 --> 17:49.570
Not now.

17:51.039 --> 17:52.806
What if I promise to use
a sports analogy?

17:52.874 --> 17:54.308
Got a minute.

17:55.844 --> 17:59.080
Mr. Baxter,
knowing Kristin

17:59.147 --> 18:01.681
has been one of <i>the</i> greatest
things in my life.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.950
Sports!

18:04.018 --> 18:06.586
Okay, it's the ultimate
frisbee championship--

18:06.653 --> 18:08.621
I said sports!

18:08.689 --> 18:12.225
Uh, yeah, it's the ultimate
football championships.

18:12.293 --> 18:15.395
And it's halftime,
and we're down by 14,

18:15.463 --> 18:17.729
and I think it's time
we change up the game.

18:17.797 --> 18:21.166
Are you asking permission
to marry my daughter?

18:22.369 --> 18:23.635
Mm, no, sir.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.605
I'm asking permission
to break up with her.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.574
Really?

18:29.642 --> 18:32.244
It's not you, it's us.
I swear.

18:33.778 --> 18:35.813
What the hell
are you talking about?

18:35.881 --> 18:38.682
I know you might be
mad or hurt,

18:38.750 --> 18:40.518
uh, but we're just drifting apart...
(Mutters)

18:40.585 --> 18:42.387
She and I. Not you and I.
We're good.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.288
I mean, I feel like in some ways
we're better than ever.

18:44.356 --> 18:47.125
Okay.

18:47.192 --> 18:49.292
Is-- is Kristin
all right with this?

18:49.360 --> 18:52.462
Yeah. It was mutual.

18:52.530 --> 18:54.964
Well, listen.
(Sets down picture)

18:55.033 --> 18:57.300
As long as you treat
my daughter with respect,

18:57.368 --> 19:01.604
your love life is really
none of my business.

19:01.672 --> 19:04.307
Thank you. That's a relief.
(Picture rustling)

19:04.375 --> 19:05.974
It's hard, because...

19:06.043 --> 19:09.678
I really loved being
a part of your family.

19:12.715 --> 19:15.217
Hey, Kyle, Kyle.

19:15.285 --> 19:18.421
I can't believe
I'm saying this.

19:18.488 --> 19:20.389
Just 'cause you're
breaking up with my kid

19:20.457 --> 19:22.323
doesn't mean you can't be
friends with my family.

19:22.391 --> 19:24.092
You could come by,
have dinner if you want.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.594
Thank you.

19:28.730 --> 19:31.699
Clean the gutters.

19:31.767 --> 19:33.801
I mean, the right way.
You want to push all that debris

19:33.869 --> 19:35.470
away from that opening
at the end of it.

19:35.538 --> 19:37.871
Okay.

19:43.644 --> 19:46.080
- Hey, V.
- Hey, honey. Look.

19:46.147 --> 19:48.682
(Door closes)
What do we got here?

19:48.749 --> 19:51.351
It's a check for the rest
of what April owes us.

19:51.419 --> 19:53.186
Wow. (Laughs) Wow!

19:55.089 --> 19:56.456
Hey, babe, I know
this is hard on you,

19:56.523 --> 19:58.057
but this is the right
thing to do.

19:58.125 --> 20:00.025
I know, I know. (Sighs)

20:00.094 --> 20:02.361
That doesn't mean she's
out of our lives, right?

20:02.429 --> 20:05.231
She'll always have a warm meal
and a roof over her head.

20:05.299 --> 20:07.166
I'm glad, honey.

20:07.234 --> 20:09.434
- Ye--
- Hey!

20:11.604 --> 20:13.905
You were so right!

20:13.973 --> 20:17.209
That guest bed
is <i>incredibly</i> comfortable!

20:19.000 --> 20:25.074

20:26.017 --> 20:28.252
You bought a tank!

20:37.116 --> 20:40.051
It may not be practical,
but it sure is lovely.

20:40.119 --> 20:43.086
Oh, the perfect
fighting machine.

20:43.154 --> 20:44.855
You gotta respect
the science and engineering

20:44.922 --> 20:47.557
- that goes into this baby.
- Yeah. "Respect." That's the word.

20:47.625 --> 20:48.992
Yep.

20:49.060 --> 20:50.493
- Let me ask you a question.
- Hmm?

20:50.561 --> 20:54.464
If I could pack this barrel
with dog poop,

20:54.531 --> 20:58.533
and get it in the general
direction of Ted's tackle box,

20:58.601 --> 21:00.636
how hard would <i>you</i> laugh?

21:00.703 --> 21:03.372
Y-you can't do that.
I mean... (Chuckles)

21:03.439 --> 21:05.274
He would file a complaint.
He might even sue.

21:05.341 --> 21:06.942
- You're right.
- Yeah.

21:07.010 --> 21:08.844
You're right.

21:08.912 --> 21:14.415
But it would wipe the smile
off his fat, smug face.

21:14.483 --> 21:16.951
Where's the nearest dog park?

21:17.019 --> 21:18.653
I'll get a trash bag.
