WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:06.340
OW, OW, OW. AAH! AAH!

00:06.374 --> 00:08.409
JIMMY, WALT, W--

00:08.442 --> 00:10.644
AHH...AHH...OW...OW...

00:10.678 --> 00:12.213
GET 'EM OFF ME,
GET 'EM OFF ME.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.714
OH, WHY DIDN'T YOU
MAKE 2 TRIPS?

00:13.747 --> 00:14.948
NO TIME. LUNCH SHIFT
WAS CRAZY,

00:14.982 --> 00:17.551
AND THAT STUPID NIGHT HOSTESS
WAS AN HOUR LATE TO RELIEVE ME--

00:17.585 --> 00:21.222
MOM, CHILL.
HENRY'S SOCCER TEAM
ISN'T EVEN HERE YET.

00:21.255 --> 00:24.825
THE GAMES SUPPOSED TO BE OVER
AT 4:00. WALT, CHIPS IN BOWL.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.726
ICE IN THE COOLER.

00:25.759 --> 00:29.530
WHOA, IT'S LIKE MELTED
INTO ONE BIG PIECE.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.067
GO GET THE COOLER.

00:33.101 --> 00:33.867
MOM...

00:33.901 --> 00:36.137
HEY, HOW ARE
MY LITTLE WINNERS, HUH?

00:36.170 --> 00:37.071
WE LOST.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.639
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
YOU'LL GET 'EM NEXT TIME.

00:38.672 --> 00:39.807
WE WOULD'VE GOT 'EM
THIS TIME,

00:39.840 --> 00:42.243
BUT THE REF
TOTALLY ROBBED US.

00:42.276 --> 00:45.213
THAT STINKING REF
BLEW THE WHOLE THING.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.247
WHAT A JERK.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.416
HEY, KIDS.

00:48.449 --> 00:52.120
WHO WANTS TO HELP ME
UNLOAD THE CAR?

00:52.153 --> 00:55.823
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DO IT YOURSELF?

00:55.856 --> 00:57.291
WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:57.325 --> 01:00.094
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

01:00.128 --> 01:03.264
THEN WHY DOES EVERYBODY
IN THE WORLD HATE YOU?

01:11.572 --> 01:14.575
YOU'RE OUT OF HERE!

01:14.608 --> 01:17.611
YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.813
OH, GOD.

01:19.847 --> 01:23.151
DON'T WORRY, BABY.
ME AND HENRY ARE STILL PALS.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.253
I DON'T LIKE YOU!

01:25.286 --> 01:27.288
OK, PAL.

01:41.735 --> 01:42.670
AW, COME ON, KIDS.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.739
YOU GOTTA LET THIS GAME GO.
YOU'RE AMERICANS.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.509
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
LOUSY AT SOCCER.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.843
BUT I'M FROM BRAZIL.

01:49.877 --> 01:54.215
WELL, YOU'RE FITTING IN
VERY NICELY.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.116
HEY, I'M THE REF.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.552
EVERYBODY HATES THE REF.
IT COMES WITH THE JOB.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.887
HENRY SURE IS
TAKING THIS HARD.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.491
LOOK, HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE FINE.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.925
IT'S JUST A SOCCER GAME.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.761
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY GOT
A 74 ON A MATH TEST.

02:07.795 --> 02:08.629
HEY, LET GO OF IT, JIMMY.

02:08.662 --> 02:12.733
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU TRY
LETTING GO OF "C."

02:12.766 --> 02:16.304
HEY, BUDDY,
I PRAYED FOR "Cs."

02:16.337 --> 02:19.873
POOR HENRY. HE SHOULDN'T
EVEN BE PLAYING SOCCER.

02:19.907 --> 02:20.774
WHY NOT?

02:20.808 --> 02:23.744
WELL, DAD, HENRY...

02:23.777 --> 02:26.547
IS, UH, YOU KNOW--

02:26.580 --> 02:28.316
BAD.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.918
HE'S HORRIBLE.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.297
DAD, HE'S THE WORST PLAYER
ON THE TEAM,

02:43.331 --> 02:45.299
AND THEY'RE THE WORST TEAM
IN THE LEAGUE.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.768
SO WHY DID HE EVEN WANNA
PLAY IN THE FIRST PLACE?

02:47.801 --> 02:48.602
HE DIDN'T WANNA PLAY.

02:48.636 --> 02:52.773
YEAH, HE DID. HE JUST
DIDN'T KNOW IT.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.444
OOH, I WANNA TAKE TAP.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.912
AHH, WHOA.
HEY, TAP IS GOOD,

02:58.946 --> 03:00.848
BUT LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE
THEY HAVE, OK?

03:00.881 --> 03:02.816
I DON'T CARE WHAT ELSE
THEY'VE GOT.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.817
I WANNA TAKE TAP.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.987
UH, WHOA, HEY, HENRY, LOOK.
THEY'VE GOT SOCCER.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.789
SOCCER'S WITH YOUR FEET.

03:08.822 --> 03:09.590
TAP IS WITH YOUR FEET, TOO.

03:09.623 --> 03:14.395
OH, UH, LOOK.
THE PEN DOESN'T REACH.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.763
TAP HAS ITS OWN PEN.

03:15.796 --> 03:19.467
OK, SOCCER IT IS.
GOOD CHOICE, BUDDY.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.736
OK, LET'S GO. WE'RE GONNA
BE LATE FOR DINNER. COME ON.

03:22.770 --> 03:23.537
GOOD SAVE, SON.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.873
CONGRATULATIONS.
WALT'S ON YOUR SIDE.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.675
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M WRONG.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.809
YEAH, IT DOES.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.745
HOW YOU DOING?

03:31.779 --> 03:32.780
GOOD.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.782
DID YOU SEE THAT?

03:34.815 --> 03:36.717
THAT WAS WEIRD.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.251
WHAT?

03:37.285 --> 03:39.253
GOOD.

03:39.287 --> 03:41.722
UH-UH, THINGS
ARE NEVER "GOOD."

03:42.022 --> 03:44.325
OH, HEY, LIL.
HOW YOU DOING?

03:44.358 --> 03:45.793
FINE.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.496
OK.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.332
UCH.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.668
WHATEVER.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.371
JEEZ, I'M GLAD I HAD BOYS.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.407
I'LL GO TALK TO HER.

04:02.876 --> 04:06.580
YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:06.614 --> 04:09.383
I FINALLY DID IT.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.818
WHAT?

04:10.851 --> 04:12.019
I TALKED TO HIM.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.020
WHO?

04:13.053 --> 04:14.922
THE CONCESSION STAND
GUY.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.890
WHAT CONCESSION STAND GUY?

04:16.924 --> 04:19.259
MY SOULMATE.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.929
HI, WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?

04:21.962 --> 04:23.964
UM, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

04:23.997 --> 04:28.035
WELL, THERE'S
THE HOT DOG SPECIAL.

04:28.068 --> 04:31.305
OK, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

04:31.839 --> 04:32.740
FRANK.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.607
COMING UP.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.909
HEH. IT'S FUNNY--
YOUR NAME BEING FRANK

04:35.943 --> 04:38.346
AND YOU SELLING FRANKS.

04:38.379 --> 04:41.849
HEH HEH. YEAH.

04:42.483 --> 04:46.720
OK, UM, ALL RIGHT.
ONE, UH, FRANK...

04:46.754 --> 04:49.857
ONE CHIPS...

04:49.890 --> 04:51.959
AND A DIET COKE.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.562
THANKS.

04:54.595 --> 04:58.399
IT WAS THE MOST INCREDIBLE,
ROMANTIC CONVERSATION EVER.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.533
WE TOTALLY CONNECTED.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.835
HE EVEN KNEW WHAT KIND
OF SODA I DRINK.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.004
OHH, THAT IS UNCANNY.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.739
THANK YOU.

05:05.773 --> 05:09.977
OH, MAN, YOU SHOULD
HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
ABOUT DAD OUT THERE.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.579
OH, WHAT DID THEY SAY?

05:11.612 --> 05:15.749
YOU REMEMBER THAT EMINEM CD
THAT YOU CONFISCATED FROM ME?

05:15.783 --> 05:16.316
YEAH?

05:16.350 --> 05:18.386
IT'S KINDA LIKE THAT...

05:18.419 --> 05:19.953
EXCEPT THEY'RE NOT RHYMING.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.489
NICE. OK, COME WITH ME.

05:21.522 --> 05:26.527
SEAN, THE KIDS
ARE USING SWEAR WORDS
IN OUR BACKYARD.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.963
OH, HEY, WHOA, NO.
I AM NOT THE BAD DAD HERE, OK?

05:29.997 --> 05:33.601
I JUST GOT HIM INVOLVED IN
THIS THING SO WE COULD DO
SOMETHING TOGETHER.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.735
THAT'S WHY I VOLUNTEERED TO REF.

05:34.768 --> 05:39.006
I MEAN, I DID EVERYTHING I COULD
JUST TO MAKE HIM HAPPY.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.076
OH, I CAN'T EAT THAT.
IT'S FOR CHAMPIONS.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.145
WHOA, COME ON,
HENRY.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.814
WINNING ISN'T
THE IMPORTANT THING.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.650
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT
YOU PLAYED A GOOD GAME.

05:49.683 --> 05:55.122
I LET 8 GOALS GET PAST ME.
WE HAVEN'T WON A SINGLE GAME.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.123
OH, COME ON.

05:56.156 --> 05:59.059
EVEN THE BEST SOCCER PLAYERS
HAVE BAD STRETCHES.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.528
THEY DO?
OH, SURE.

06:00.561 --> 06:03.597
LIKE PELE AND...

06:03.631 --> 06:06.166
WHOEVER THE EQUIVALENT
OF PELE IS TODAY.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.100
WHO WOULD THAT BE, SEAN?

06:07.134 --> 06:09.803
THERE WAS THAT WOMAN

06:09.837 --> 06:11.939
WHO TOOK HER SHIRT OFF
DURING THE WORLD CUP.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.807
DID YOU SEE HER BOOBIES?

06:13.841 --> 06:16.610
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU NEED, HENRY?

06:16.644 --> 06:19.112
YOU NEED TO PRACTICE.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.115
ALL RIGHT, YOU READY, HENRY?
HERE IT COMES. OK, BUDDY?

06:22.149 --> 06:24.652
UH-HUH.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.054
OW!

06:27.087 --> 06:31.592
HENRY! YOU OK?
YOU OK?

06:31.625 --> 06:33.994
NO. I STINK.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.629
COME ON, YOU GOT
A PIECE OF IT.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.064
OH, YEAH, WITH MY FACE.

06:37.097 --> 06:40.000
SOCCER'S REALLY GETTING
YOU DOWN, ISN'T IT?

06:40.033 --> 06:41.001
OH, YEAH.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.070
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO WHEN
SOMETHING GETS ME DOWN?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.071
WHAT?

06:44.104 --> 06:45.305
QUIT.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.908
BUT MY COACH
SAYS QUITTERS NEVER WIN
AND WINNERS NEVER QUIT.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.577
DON'T THINK OF IT
AS QUITTING.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.844
THINK OF IT
AS NON-CONFORMITY.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.013
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.915
IF BOB MARLEY HAD
STUCK TO SOCCER,

06:54.948 --> 06:56.884
NO ONE EVER WOULD HAVE
HEARD OF HIM.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.952
UNCLE EDDIE,
WHO'S BOB MARLEY?

06:58.986 --> 07:02.823
I HAVE TO START
SPENDING A LOT MORE TIME
AT YOUR HOUSE.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.526
WHY DIDN'T I LET HENRY
SIGN UP FOR TAP?

07:05.559 --> 07:08.562
BECAUSE OF YOUR
MACHO INSECURITY?

07:08.596 --> 07:10.931
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.937
OH, HONEY, ANOTHER
SOCCER DREAM?

07:16.970 --> 07:17.871
UH-HUH.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.206
REGULAR OR NAKED?

07:19.239 --> 07:20.173
NAKED.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.843
COME HERE.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.077
AAH!

07:24.111 --> 07:25.078
OHH.

07:25.112 --> 07:25.846
OOH.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.080
IF HENRY'S SO BAD,

07:27.114 --> 07:28.916
WHY DO THEY
MAKE HIM PLAY?

07:28.949 --> 07:31.118
EVERYBODY PLAYS.
THAT'S THE RULE.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.120
THAT'S
A STUPID RULE.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.154
NO, IT'S NOT.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.089
IT'S DESIGNED TO HELP THEM
BUILD THEIR SELF-ESTEEM.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.159
IT HASN'T. IT'S DESTROYED
HIS SELF-ESTEEM.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.128
SO WHY DO THEY DO IT?

07:41.161 --> 07:44.565
WELL, IT'S SO NOBODY
FEELS LEFT OUT.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.133
OF THE MISERY?

07:47.167 --> 07:49.770
OH, MY GOD, HE'S RIGHT.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.641
SELF-ESTEEM
IS OVERRATED, ANYWAY.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.142
MOST OF THE WORK
IN THIS COUNTRY

07:55.175 --> 07:59.513
IS DONE BY PEOPLE
WHO HATE THEMSELVES.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.683
DID I SOUND STUPID?

08:02.716 --> 08:03.617
WHAT?

08:03.651 --> 08:05.819
WHEN I WAS TALKING TO
FRANK THE HOT DOG GUY,

08:05.853 --> 08:07.855
DID I SOUND STUPID?

08:08.556 --> 08:09.923
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.258
I TOLD YOU WHAT I SAID.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.527
I THOUGHT
IT SOUNDED FINE.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.563
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

08:15.596 --> 08:16.664
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?

08:16.697 --> 08:17.598
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

08:17.631 --> 08:22.770
WELL, THERE'S
THE HOT DOG SPECIAL.

08:22.803 --> 08:27.608
OK, THAT SOUNDS GOOD, FRANK.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.942
COMING UP.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.545
IT'S FUNNY, YOUR NAME
BEING FRANK

08:31.579 --> 08:34.214
AND YOU SELLING FRANKS.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.148
YEAH.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.084
HA HA HA.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.121
THAT DIDN'T
SOUND THAT BAD.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.255
NOT THAT BAD?

08:42.289 --> 08:46.927
ITS FUNNY, YOUR NAME BEING FRANK
AND YOU SELLING FRANKS.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.137
GAAH, I HATE MYSELF.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.707
NO, NO, SWEETIE, DON'T
DO THIS TO YOURSELF.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.841
I'M TELLING YOU,
IN A COUPLE YEARS,

09:00.874 --> 09:02.743
YOU'RE GONNA
LOOK BACK AT THIS,
AND YOU'RE GONNA LAUGH.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.144
YEAH, AND I'LL LAUGH
LIKE THIS--

09:04.177 --> 09:07.615
[LAUGHS LIKE A SEAL
AND SNORTS]

09:10.317 --> 09:13.654
I HATE TO SEE HENRY
SO DEPRESSED.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.623
HE ALWAYS BEEN
SUCH A HAPPY KID.

09:15.656 --> 09:19.760
GIVE HIM A PACK OF SEA MONKEYS,
HE'S ENTERTAINED FOR A MONTH.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.194
DAD, THOSE WEREN'T
SEA MONKEYS.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.096
LOOK, HENRY.

09:23.130 --> 09:26.266
IT'S A TINY FAMILY
OF SEA MONKEYS.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.901
WOW. COOL.

09:27.935 --> 09:31.872
ISN'T IT?
LOOK AT THEM SWIM.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.175
AH-CHOO.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.710
BLESS YOU.

09:36.744 --> 09:37.845
OH, THANKS.

09:37.878 --> 09:41.281
LITTLE NIPPER WAS IN HOG HEAVEN
WITH THOSE SEA MONKEYS.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.316
THEY WEREN'T
SEA MONKEYS.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.318
THEY WERE TO HENRY.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.155
AND NOW LOOK AT HIM.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.489
SEE, THAT'S
THE PROBLEM, OK?

09:49.522 --> 09:52.626
AS IT TURNS OUT, HENRY
IS A WORSE LOSER THAN
HE IS A SOCCER PLAYER.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.796
SO THAT'S WHY SEAN TOOK MATTERS
INTO HIS OWN HANDS.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.631
OK, LET'S NOT GET
INTO THAT, PLEASE.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.966
WHAT DID YOU DO?

09:58.999 --> 10:01.334
LOOK, HENRY HAD BEEN
BUMMED OUT FOR WEEKS.

10:01.368 --> 10:06.306
SO AT LAST SATURDAY'S GAME,
THEY WERE ACTUALLY AHEAD.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.047
YEAH.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.283
HOW ABOUT
OUR PIONEERS, HUH?

10:16.316 --> 10:17.384
WE RULE.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.719
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

10:18.752 --> 10:22.022
I COULD GO
TO THE CONCESSION STAND AND
GET A HOT DOG, IF YOU WANT.

10:22.055 --> 10:22.723
NAH.

10:22.756 --> 10:25.192
I'LL TAKE ONE
IF YOU'RE GOING.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.200
ARE YOU GOING?

10:33.233 --> 10:36.403
I'M WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.470
HOW ABOUT NOW?

10:37.504 --> 10:40.207
YOU DON'T JUST
WALK UP THERE
AND ASK FOR A HOT DOG.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.209
IT'S WORKED
IN THE PAST.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.244
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.847
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LEAVE ME ALONE!

10:47.314 --> 10:51.351
OK, FINNERTY.
YOU'RE IN GOAL.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.854
Team: AW...

10:59.459 --> 11:02.229
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO, HENRY!

11:04.231 --> 11:05.933
All: AW...

11:05.966 --> 11:06.900
Sean: GOAL!

11:06.934 --> 11:08.235
DON'T TELL ME.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.771
I'M AFRAID SO.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.239
OOF!

11:18.746 --> 11:20.313
Sean: GOAL!

11:20.347 --> 11:24.217
LORD, PLEASE DON'T
LET HENRY BE THE GOAT.
PLEASE. PLEASE.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.019
THERE'S NO SHAME
IN QUITTING, HENRY.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.789
YOU CAN WALK OFF
THAT FIELD RIGHT NOW.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.445
OHH...OHH...

11:53.280 --> 11:56.316
OHH...OHH...

11:58.318 --> 12:00.287
OHH! OHH!

12:01.789 --> 12:02.389
AND TIME!

12:02.422 --> 12:05.258
TIME, GAME OVER!
GOOD GAME.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.194
YAY!

12:08.061 --> 12:09.296
YES!

12:12.299 --> 12:15.402
GOOD GAME, GUYS.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.437
ALL RIGHT, GAME'S OVER.
GOOD EFFORT.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.773
GOOD EFFORT, SON.
GOOD EFFORT.

12:23.310 --> 12:26.847
OH!
YEAH.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.217
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.821
AW, GOOD GAME.
GOOD GAME.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.491
YOU'RE A REF AND YOU
FIXED THE GAME.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.327
YOU VIOLATED
A SACRED TRUST.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.428
LOOK, IT WASN'T
PREMEDITATED, OK?

12:41.461 --> 12:44.364
I JUST COULDN'T
STAND BY AND WATCH
HENRY LOSE AGAIN.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.565
SO YOU CHEATED
FOR HIM.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.401
WELL, IT'S NOT
CHEATING IF IT'S
SPONTANEOUS.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.402
YES, IT IS.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.839
OH, WELL,
IT'S NOT AS BAD
AS PLANNED CHEATING.

12:51.872 --> 12:55.475
YOUR MORAL COMPASS
HAS GOT NO NEEDLE.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.412
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
FORGET THOSE HOT DOGS,

12:59.446 --> 13:02.049
BECAUSE WE'VE
GOT...PIZZA!

13:02.082 --> 13:02.782
THAT'S NOT PIZZA.

13:02.816 --> 13:06.119
OH, NO.
PITA BREAD
AND KETCHUP.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.354
HEY, WHAT?
IT'S GOOD.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.923
WHO CARES
WHAT YOU THINK,
YOU BIG JERK!

13:09.957 --> 13:11.424
GREAT, STARVE,
THEN, YOU LITTLE--

13:11.458 --> 13:12.960
SEAN!

13:15.528 --> 13:16.396
ENJOY.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.865
Walt: PITA.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.267
YOU KNOW, THEY
WOULDN'T BE SO
DEVASTATED THIS WEEK

13:20.300 --> 13:22.602
IF YOU DIDN'T
GET THEIR HOPES UP
LAST WEEK.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.104
DAD, THEY'RE
PITIFUL. OK?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.372
I COULDN'T
HELP MYSELF.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.307
ALL RIGHT, SURE,
I HAD QUALMS.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.241
QUALMS.

13:28.275 --> 13:28.976
YEAH, I DID.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.078
CLAUDIA HELPED ME
THROUGH THEM.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.613
IT WAS A STUPID
THING TO DO.

13:33.646 --> 13:37.517
I COMPLETELY SCREWED
AN INNOCENT TEAM
OF 8 TO 10-YEAR-OLDS.

13:37.550 --> 13:41.221
MR. INTEGRITY CHEATED.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.224
IT WAS AN AWFUL
THING TO DO.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.025
YEAH, IT WAS.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.361
IT WAS RUTHLESS,
BUT YOU DIDN'T CARE.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.031
YOU JUST ACTED.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.365
HMM...

13:53.166 --> 13:54.567
YOU GOT DOWN
OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE,

13:54.601 --> 13:56.569
AND YOU ROLLED
AROUND IN THE DIRT.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.438
OK, STOP IT.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.439
YOU'RE AN OUTLAW.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.573
STOP! STOP!

14:00.607 --> 14:03.110
OH, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO? WHISTLE ME
FOR A FOUL?

14:03.143 --> 14:04.011
I JUST MIGHT
HAVE TO.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.413
UH-HUH. WELL,
YOU BETTER.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.381
'CAUSE
I'M GONNA SCORE.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.953
AH. AH.

14:17.157 --> 14:21.128
WHOO! WHOO!
WHOO! WHOO, BABY!
OH! WHOO!

14:21.161 --> 14:22.462
OH! OH! HA!

14:23.596 --> 14:26.399
STOP! WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK I NEED TO HEAR
ABOUT THIS?

14:26.433 --> 14:28.668
LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING
THAT I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE THE ONE--

14:28.701 --> 14:32.405
NOW, I'VE HEARD ENOUGH
ABOUT THIS SUBJECT.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.577
HOW DO I LOOK
IN THIS?

14:37.610 --> 14:38.611
YOU LOOK GREAT.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.479
NO, SERIOUSLY.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.314
SERIOUSLY,
YOU LOOK GREAT.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.083
WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT HE THINKS.

14:43.116 --> 14:47.454
UM, I ASSUME WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT FRANK,
THE HOT DOG BOY.

14:47.487 --> 14:50.157
HE THINKS
I'M A BIG FAT FATTY.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.491
YOU'RE NOT FAT AT ALL.

14:51.524 --> 14:56.029
THEN WHY DID HE ASSUME
I WANTED A DIET COKE?

14:56.063 --> 14:59.699
ONE FRANK, CHIPS...

14:59.732 --> 15:00.934
AND A DIET COKE.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.536
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
A MINUTE AGO YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE SOULMATES

15:03.570 --> 15:04.771
'CAUSE HE KNEW YOU
WANTED A DIET COKE.

15:04.804 --> 15:08.175
THAT WAS BEFORE
I REALIZED HE THOUGHT
I WAS A BEACHED WHALE.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.410
YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD
THE WAY HE SAID IT.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.313
AND A DIET COKE.

15:13.346 --> 15:17.084
AND A DIET COKE.

15:17.117 --> 15:22.255
DEAR LORD, YOU ARE
SO FREAKING FAT!

15:22.289 --> 15:23.390
OH, NOW, COME ON.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.326
HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE.
WHAT A HUGE JERK!

15:26.359 --> 15:27.995
YOU'RE NOT FAT!

15:28.728 --> 15:29.629
SHE'S NOT FAT!

15:29.662 --> 15:31.264
WELL, I DIDN'T
SAY SHE IS!

15:31.298 --> 15:33.366
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LET THOSE KIDS

15:33.400 --> 15:34.534
CALL YOU A NAME
LIKE THAT.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.103
DAD, IF YOU REALLY
THINK ABOUT IT,

15:36.136 --> 15:38.305
IT'S JUST A BODY PART.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.673
AND THEN THEY ADDED
THE WORD "HEAD."

15:41.408 --> 15:43.176
I'VE NEVER HEARD HENRY
BE SO DISRESPECTFUL.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.679
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
HEARD HIM LAST WEEK
AFTER THE GAME.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.481
AFTER THEY WON.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.151
YOU STINK, WE WON.
YOU STINK, WE WON.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.686
YOU STINK, WE WON.
YOU STINK, WE WON.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.457
YOU STINK, WE WON.
YOU STINK, WE WON...

15:57.490 --> 16:02.229
HEY, DAD.
DAD, CHECK OUT
MY VICTORY DANCE.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.168
PSYCH!

16:08.201 --> 16:09.102
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.305
HEY, REYNOLDS,
GUESS WHO'S BETTER
THAN YOU?

16:12.339 --> 16:13.773
ME! HA!

16:13.806 --> 16:14.407
HEY. HENRY--

16:14.441 --> 16:16.076
LOOOSER!
HENRY! HENRY, HEY!

16:16.109 --> 16:18.411
JUST A SECOND, DAD.
I'M TAUNTING THIS GUY.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.414
I KNOW. HEY, STOP!
ALL RIGHT? LOOK...

16:21.448 --> 16:22.382
LOOK, IT'S NICE
THAT YOU WON,

16:22.415 --> 16:24.451
BUT I GOT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT
YOUR ATTITUDE.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.486
OH, I'VE GOT ATTITUDE.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.456
I KNOW, BUT YOU
SHOULDN'T ACT LIKE THAT
WHEN YOU WIN.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.423
WHY NOT?

16:30.457 --> 16:32.625
WELL, YOU REMEMBER
HOW YOU FELT
WHEN YOU LOST?

16:32.659 --> 16:33.426
YEAH.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.594
WELL, THAT'S HOW YOU
MAKE PEOPLE FEEL

16:34.627 --> 16:36.596
WHEN YOU
TAUNT THEM. OK?

16:36.629 --> 16:37.830
GOOD.

16:37.864 --> 16:41.301
HEY, REYNOLDS,
YOU KNOW WHAT THE "T"
IN "T

16:41.334 --> 16:43.570
"THE LOSER"! HA!

16:43.603 --> 16:46.073
UH, UH, UH.
COME ON. LET'S GO.
INSIDE.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.474
HEY, I'M NOT DONE!

16:47.507 --> 16:48.075
COME ON.

16:48.108 --> 16:51.044
HEY, REYNOLDS!
YOU SUCK!

16:51.078 --> 16:52.445
THAT KID
WAS A BAD SPORT.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.581
BUT I GUESS
WE SHOULDN'T
BE SURPRISED,

16:54.614 --> 16:57.317
CONSIDERING
HE'S BEING RAISED
BY A CHEATER!

16:57.350 --> 17:00.220
LOOK, DAD.
I DEALT WITH IT, OK?

17:00.253 --> 17:01.654
TODAY, I DEALT WITH IT.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.523
YOU DID?
WAIT, NO. HOW?

17:03.556 --> 17:06.393
WELL, YOU SEE,
I FIGURED HENRY WOULD
GO OUT THERE TODAY, OK,

17:06.426 --> 17:09.562
AND HE'D DO HIS
LITTLE VICTORY DANCE
AND "WHOO-HOO!"

17:09.596 --> 17:10.730
YOU KNOW?
AND THEN THE PIONEERS

17:10.763 --> 17:13.166
WOULD GET THE CRAP
STOMPED OUT OF THEM
BY THE OTHER TEAM,

17:13.200 --> 17:15.802
AND IT WOULD
KNOCK HENRY DOWN
A COUPLE OF PEGS.

17:15.835 --> 17:16.536
RIGHT...

17:16.569 --> 17:19.539
DIDN'T EXACTLY
WORK OUT THAT WAY.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.208
HUH!

17:21.241 --> 17:22.709
YEAH!

17:24.277 --> 17:26.479
HYUH...OOF!

17:30.750 --> 17:34.754
IN YOUR FACE,
T-BIRDS! WHOO!

17:34.787 --> 17:36.456
WHOO!

17:38.358 --> 17:39.559
HE WAS GOOD?

17:39.592 --> 17:41.661
HE WAS...OK.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.564
SEEMS THAT LAST WEEK'S
VICTORY GAVE OUR PIONEERS

17:44.597 --> 17:46.733
A LITTLE
CONFIDENCE BOOST.
GOD, IT WAS ANNOYING.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.302
AND THE BETTER
THEY PLAYED,
THE WORSE I FELT,

17:49.336 --> 17:50.637
AND I LOOKED
AT ALL THESE T-BIRDS

17:50.670 --> 17:51.638
WHO THOUGHT
THAT THEY WERE--

17:51.671 --> 17:52.739
THEY WERE LOSERS
BECAUSE OF ME,

17:52.772 --> 17:56.609
AND I JUST--I KNEW
I HAD TO--I HAD
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.520
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

18:42.255 --> 18:43.623
I TRIPPED?

18:58.605 --> 19:00.307
IT'S GAME!

19:02.642 --> 19:03.710
IT'S GAME!

19:03.743 --> 19:05.011
YOU CHEATED
SO HENRY WOULD LOSE?

19:05.044 --> 19:07.647
YEAH, TO MAKE UP
FOR THE CHEATING I DID
LAST WEEK SO HE WOULD WIN.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.350
YOU KNOW, I HAVE
TO BE FAIR. I'M A REF.

19:10.383 --> 19:14.321
YEAH. SO NOW,
YOUR SON'S NOT
GLOATING.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.323
NOW HE'S JUST
A MISERABLE OUTCAST.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.325
NOW, LOOK. YOU KNOW,
SOME MISTAKES WERE MADE.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.659
BY YOU.
YEAH, BY ME, OK?

19:19.692 --> 19:21.694
AND SOME PEOPLE
WERE HURT.

19:21.728 --> 19:22.395
BY YOU.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.763
YES, BY ME, OK?!
I SCREWED UP!

19:23.796 --> 19:25.198
I SCREWED UP
ON TOP OF MY SCREW UP,

19:25.232 --> 19:28.535
AND I FEEL LIKE
A COMPLETE ASS, OK?

19:28.568 --> 19:30.837
OK.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.215
OH, I'LL GET IT!

19:48.721 --> 19:49.522
HI.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.359
HMM.
WELL, WELL, WELL.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.260
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.695
UM, I'M JUST PICKING UP
MY LITTLE SISTER.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.331
MMM. THEY'RE
IN THE BACK YARD.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.700
I HOPE YOU CAN
SQUEEZE BY ME.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.003
UH, SO, DID YOU
ENJOY YOUR HOT DOG?

20:04.036 --> 20:05.972
DO YOU MEAN, DID I HAVE
TIME TO TASTE IT

20:06.005 --> 20:08.741
WHILE I WAS CRAMMING IT
DOWN MY FACE?

20:08.775 --> 20:10.477
YEAH, THEY'RE
REALLY GOOD,
AREN'T THEY?

20:10.510 --> 20:11.378
MMM.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.812
HI, FRANK.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.447
HOW DID YOU
GET SO MUDDY?

20:14.481 --> 20:17.284
HER DAD KNOCKED ME DOWN.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.352
YEP.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.788
HE'S A BIG
FAT BASTARD, TOO.

20:23.022 --> 20:23.790
UH...

20:23.823 --> 20:26.426
SO YOU COMING
TO THE GAME NEXT WEEK?

20:26.459 --> 20:27.360
WHAT?

20:27.394 --> 20:29.796
THEY'RE PLAYING A GAME
ON SUNDAY. YOU COMING?

20:31.564 --> 20:32.432
YEAH, YEAH.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.602
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I'M COMING
TO THE GAME.

20:35.635 --> 20:38.271
I GUESS I'LL
SEE YOU THERE, THEN.

20:38.305 --> 20:40.373
OK.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.578
I GUESS I'LL
SEE YOU THERE.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.781
I GUE I'LL
SEE YOU THERE.

20:48.815 --> 20:53.753
I GUESS I'LL SEE
YOU THERE! OHH!

20:53.786 --> 20:55.888
I'M GOING
TO MY ROOM.

20:55.922 --> 20:59.292
HENRY, YOU'RE
THE HOST. YOU CAN'T
LEAVE YOUR FRIENDS.

20:59.326 --> 21:00.293
THEY ASKED ME TO.

21:00.327 --> 21:03.930
UH, BUDDY, COME ON.
COME ON DOWN HERE.
PARK IT.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.766
LISTEN, HENRY.
TOMORROW,

21:06.799 --> 21:09.302
THIS WHOLE THING
IS GONNA BE FORGOTTEN.

21:09.336 --> 21:10.870
WHY DO I HAVE
TO DO SPORTS?

21:10.903 --> 21:12.872
WHY CAN'T I BE
A NERD LIKE JIMMY?

21:12.905 --> 21:14.741

SOMETHING THAT WE
COULD DO TOGETHER,

THAT SOCCER'S NOT
YOUR FAVORITE THING.

21:28.355 --> 21:29.356
I HATE IT.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.957
OK, BUT--BUT THERE'S PLENTY
OF OTHER THINGS TO DO.
