ADULT SHELDON:
Classical physics can

00:05.440 --> 00:07.529
predict a lot about the world.

00:07.572 --> 00:09.531
For example,
it can tell us what happens

00:09.574 --> 00:13.709
when one pool ball knocks
into another.

00:13.752 --> 00:17.321
But when multiple balls careen
in different directions,

00:17.365 --> 00:20.063
we've entered the wild
and woolly world

00:20.107 --> 00:21.934
of nonlinear dynamics.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.632
And you don't need me
to tell you

00:23.675 --> 00:26.548
that it's impossible to predict
what will happen next.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.898
Actually, based on the state
of our educational system,

00:28.941 --> 00:30.856
you probably do.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.034
Now imagine those are people.

00:34.077 --> 00:37.559
Even a brilliant young ball
who graduated high school at 11

00:37.602 --> 00:38.995
can be caught in the maelstrom.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.605
Aah!

00:40.649 --> 00:42.607
Our first collision was set
in motion

00:42.651 --> 00:44.870
when Pastor Jeff
and Robin had their baby.

00:44.914 --> 00:47.786
Isn't he the cutest?

00:47.830 --> 00:50.354
He sure is. Oh.Yeah, he's an angel.

00:50.398 --> 00:52.791
He's just happy all the time--

00:52.835 --> 00:54.576
morning, afternoon,

00:54.619 --> 00:58.449
middle of the night,
2:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m.,

00:58.493 --> 01:01.148
all the a.m.'s, really.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.498
Dip the pacifier
in some whiskey,

01:03.541 --> 01:04.673

01:04.716 --> 01:05.891
But don't use
the good stuff.

01:05.935 --> 01:08.546
They can't tell the difference.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.113

I could love anything

01:10.157 --> 01:11.723
this much.

think I loved my dog Waffles,

01:13.769 --> 01:16.641

been sleeping lately.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.475
Why don't you go home?

01:24.519 --> 01:26.347

01:26.390 --> 01:29.959
No. No, I'm good.

01:30.002 --> 01:32.266

Away from my son,

01:36.618 --> 01:38.010

on Sunday.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.373
I'm sure I'll be fine by Sunday.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.418
You don't have
to decide right now.

01:54.462 --> 01:55.419
I'll do the sermon.

09:56.465 --> 09:57.640
right this second.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.076
[crying]:
No.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.904
I am not gonna
tell you again.

10:00.948 --> 10:03.080
Why do you always
take his side?

10:03.124 --> 10:04.865
I do not.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.041
Yes, you do.
Everybody does.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.651
I hate this family.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.871
You are grounded,
young lady.

10:10.914 --> 10:13.003
Fine!

10:13.047 --> 10:14.657
It is fine!

10:16.877 --> 10:18.792
Hmm, thanks for handling that.

10:22.012 --> 10:24.319
Hey, Moon Pie.
Is everything okay?

10:24.362 --> 10:26.147
No, everything is terrible.

10:26.190 --> 10:29.716
Oh. That sounds like
a job for cookies.

10:31.413 --> 10:35.896
Okay, here you go.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.724
You're not baking them fresh?

10:37.767 --> 10:40.204
Do you want me to bake
or you want me to listen?

10:42.642 --> 10:46.602
I'm sorry she ruined
your picture, but, you know,

10:46.646 --> 10:48.169
she's having a bad day.

10:48.212 --> 10:50.606
Oh, please, she can find
another boyfriend.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.348
I know you're mad at her.I hate her.

10:53.391 --> 10:56.394
Hey, don't say that
about family.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.570
You say mean stuff
about my dad.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.834
That's different.
He deserves it.
But Missy...

11:00.877 --> 11:02.400
Listen here.
She's your sister.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.707
She's always gonna be
your sister,

11:04.751 --> 11:06.491
so you have to find a way
to forgive her.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.537
But she did this
just to hurt me.

11:08.580 --> 11:09.843
I know.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.149
But she's hurting, too.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.585
What does that have to do
with me?

11:13.629 --> 11:14.717
You're the big brother.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.110
I'm only two minutes older.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.155
Which makes you
the big brother,

11:18.199 --> 11:21.071
which means that it is
your job to look out for her.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.682
That doesn't make sense.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.467
Why should random birth order
determine moral responsibility?

11:25.510 --> 11:27.469
I don't make the rules,
Moon Pie.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.645
Doesn't seem like
you make cookies either.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.560
What's taking so long?

11:32.779 --> 11:34.389
It would be nice
if I didn't have

11:34.432 --> 11:36.260
to come home after
a long day at work

11:36.304 --> 11:38.306
and take care
of everything here.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.351
You didn't.
I was handling it

11:40.395 --> 11:42.179
till you came and bulldozed
right over me.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.572
Sheldon was upset.

11:43.615 --> 11:44.921
This isn't about Sheldon.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.531
It's about you thinking
you're always right.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.621
MARY:
That is not true.

11:49.665 --> 11:52.668
This is me wishing that
after work I could come home

11:52.712 --> 11:54.931
and have my kids
not at each other's throats.

11:54.975 --> 11:58.456
And maybe once have
someone else make dinner.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.502
GEORGE SR.:
Why? So you could tell me
how I made it wrong?

12:00.545 --> 12:02.983
MARY:
I had a long day.
Are you trying to make it worse?

12:03.026 --> 12:04.898
GEORGE SR.:
Oh, I think you already
took care of that.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.291
MARY: I do not.GEORGE SR.: You act like
you're the only thing

12:07.335 --> 12:08.728
holding this house together.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.133
Missy?

12:24.178 --> 12:26.006
What are you doing?

12:26.049 --> 12:27.747
Hiding from you, idiot.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.837
I found you.
You're not very good at this.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.882
Just go home.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.972
Where are you going?I'm running away.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.887
You can't run away.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.715
Too late.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.064
Then I'm telling Mom.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.979
Of course you are.
Then she'll side with you,

12:43.023 --> 12:45.199
and I'll get in trouble,
just like always.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.768
Fine. I won't tell.Great.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.160
But I'm coming with you.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.380
You're one of the people
I'm running away from.

12:52.423 --> 12:55.165
I'm sorry, but I can't let you
wander at night by yourself.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.864
I'm your big brother.We're twins.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.126
I was born two minutes
earlier, which apparently

12:59.169 --> 13:00.954
makes me responsible for you.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.303
That's dumb.

13:02.346 --> 13:05.175
I'm not happy about it
either, but here we are.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.789
[sighs]

13:13.749 --> 13:15.229
Hey.

13:15.272 --> 13:16.883
Hello.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.580
What's up?

13:18.623 --> 13:20.408
Nothing.

13:20.451 --> 13:21.757
Who died?

13:24.325 --> 13:25.892
Whoa, did somebody really die?

13:25.935 --> 13:27.371
No one died.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.330
Cool. Where's dinner?

13:29.373 --> 13:31.723
Anyone who wants dinner
can make it for themselves.

13:31.767 --> 13:32.855
I am not cooking.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.204
Don't take it out on him.

13:34.248 --> 13:37.164
Ooh, take what out on me?Stay out of it.

13:37.207 --> 13:38.905
You really want to
start this up again?

13:38.948 --> 13:41.864
Wait, are you asking me what
I want? Well, that's a first.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.780
Oh, please, your whole life
is doing whatever you want.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.912
Oh, really?

13:45.955 --> 13:47.609
I can just leave.

13:47.652 --> 13:50.003
Did I want to get stuck
coaching high school football?

13:50.046 --> 13:52.396
Did I want to live across
the street from your mother?

13:52.440 --> 13:54.050
Did I want to spend my evening
getting yelled at

13:54.094 --> 13:56.096
by my daughter and my son
and my wife?

13:56.139 --> 13:58.925
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you were so unhappy.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.449
Because you never bother
to ask.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.803
[door opens, shuts]

14:17.944 --> 14:19.815
Where are we going?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.121
Right there.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.211
An old shack in the
middle of the woods?

14:24.254 --> 14:25.821
Have you even seen
Scooby Doo?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.867
Great, go home.

14:27.910 --> 14:31.000
At night, by myself?
Nice try.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.834
Do you come here a lot?

14:38.878 --> 14:41.924
Sometimes, when I want
to be alone.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.708
Alone from me.

14:43.752 --> 14:46.407
Not just you.
Everyone.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.629
Is this about that boy?

14:51.673 --> 14:53.936
I don't want to talk about it.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.416
Is he why you were
getting rid of your toys

14:55.459 --> 14:56.896
and your posters?

14:56.939 --> 14:58.941
Because I don't think you should
change for some boy.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.812
You're just saying that
'cause you hate change.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.553
You don't care
about my feelings.

15:02.597 --> 15:03.903
How can you say that?

15:03.946 --> 15:05.339
I'm literally risking my life
to be here.

15:05.382 --> 15:09.038
Look around. It is tetanus
as far as the eye can see.

15:10.387 --> 15:13.042
[knock on door]Come in.

15:15.915 --> 15:16.872
I figured you didn't eat.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.961
I made you some soup.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.745
Oh, thank you.

15:20.789 --> 15:21.833
But you didn't
have to do that.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.923
Everything's fine.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.577
I ain't a kid.
You don't gotta lie to me.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.405
[sighs]

15:28.449 --> 15:30.886
Okay.

15:30.930 --> 15:35.412
Honestly, I'm upset
with your father.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.849
And I'm upset with myself.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.416
Why?

15:39.460 --> 15:43.986
'Cause... he's right.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.858
Maybe I do think I know best,

15:46.902 --> 15:48.425
and I can be critical.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.864
But thank you
for making me soup.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.910
You're welcome.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.001
Did you put water in this?

15:59.045 --> 16:01.351
Was I supposed to?

16:04.050 --> 16:05.355
It's fine.

16:16.627 --> 16:18.760
And then today I found
out he was actually

16:18.803 --> 16:19.848
holding hands
with Nicole

16:19.891 --> 16:21.154
at the roller rink.Who's Nicole?

16:21.197 --> 16:24.592
A seventh-grader.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.550
So you want to appear
more mature

16:26.594 --> 16:28.161
to make him like you again.

16:28.204 --> 16:29.423
I guess.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.468
Hmm. Well, I'd suggest
a bow tie,

16:31.512 --> 16:32.817
but that's kind of my thing.

16:35.124 --> 16:37.561
I'm sorry I ripped
your picture.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.737
Thank you.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.522
And I wasn't just upset
about the room changing.

16:41.565 --> 16:42.958
It was also you.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.481
Me what?

16:44.525 --> 16:45.830
You're changing, too.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.049
How?

16:47.093 --> 16:48.050
You like boys, and you're

16:48.094 --> 16:49.443
half an inch taller than me now.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.532
It's called growing up.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.969
Well, I don't like it.Trust me,

16:54.013 --> 16:56.493
20 years from now you're not
gonna be sitting around,

16:56.537 --> 16:59.453
talking about Star Trek
and reading comic books.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.629
Would you like to bet on that?

17:01.672 --> 17:04.066
A dollar.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.415
Hmm.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.419
ADULT SHELDON:
She still hasn't paid me.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.117
And guess who's wearing
Star Trek underpants

17:11.160 --> 17:12.727
right now.

17:18.602 --> 17:22.171
That's the thing
with pool balls and people.

17:22.215 --> 17:26.480
They are both... unpredictable.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.917
Hi, George.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.614
Oh, hey, Brenda.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.138
What brings you out tonight?

17:32.181 --> 17:35.402
Just needed to get out
of the house.

17:35.445 --> 17:36.751
[sighs heavily]

17:36.794 --> 17:38.796
I hear that.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.060
You want some company?

17:41.103 --> 17:43.105
Sure.
