00:03.290 --> 00:06.500
Dre: Parenting. It's probably
the most important part

00:06.500 --> 00:08.330
of being a parent.

00:08.330 --> 00:11.380
And growing up, my mom
parented the hell out of me.

00:11.380 --> 00:14.170
Little boy!
You got homework!

00:14.170 --> 00:17.580
And you made me ruin
my oatmeal mask.

00:17.580 --> 00:20.210
So, now, I'm gonna
ruin your ass.

00:20.210 --> 00:22.040
So, now that I'm a parent,

00:22.040 --> 00:25.620
I demand the same good behavior
from my kids --

00:25.620 --> 00:29.000
especially at our school's
pancake breakfast fundraisers.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.380
Okay, guys.
How do we cut our food?

00:32.380 --> 00:34.580
Both: Continental style.
Tines down.

00:34.580 --> 00:39.210
Mm-hmm. And remember, chew
each bite at least 40 times.

00:39.210 --> 00:41.460
-Yeah.
-I-I-I have oatmeal.

00:41.460 --> 00:42.620
-Chew it.
-Mm-hmm.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.080
That's how you become
a winner in life.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.540
Yep.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.080
Unlike your weirdo classmates
over there.

00:49.670 --> 00:52.880
Jar put his boots
right on the table. Baller.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.620
Hey, don't you worry about
what Jar is doing.

00:56.620 --> 00:58.880
That's "White Breakfast."

00:58.880 --> 01:02.000
You just sit back and enjoy
your "Black Breakfast".

01:02.000 --> 01:04.620
And remember,
if you ever misbehave,

01:04.620 --> 01:08.000
it's a reflection on
our entire community.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.540
Wha-- how --

01:09.540 --> 01:11.120
Ooh!

01:11.120 --> 01:13.790
Handle it.

01:13.790 --> 01:16.040
Excuse me.

01:16.040 --> 01:22.420
Hi. Your daughter just took
my bacon and broke my yolk.

01:22.420 --> 01:24.670
It's okay. She believes
in communal food.

01:24.670 --> 01:27.080
Really?
Well, here's the thing --

01:27.080 --> 01:30.750
I think that's stupid.

01:30.750 --> 01:34.080
Father, may we please be excused
to use the lavatory?

01:34.080 --> 01:35.750
Of course you may,
my children.

01:38.460 --> 01:42.670
I am so proud that
we are raising perfect kids.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.960
When you know right,
you do right.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.790
Cheers!
-Cheerio!

01:47.790 --> 01:51.460
And since my system works
and my kids never misbehave,

01:51.460 --> 01:54.250
I never expected this news
from their teacher...

01:54.250 --> 01:57.120
I caught these kids
showing these kids

01:57.120 --> 01:58.710
how to spray paint
the bathroom.

01:58.710 --> 02:01.000
Now, I won't tell you
what they were painting,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.500
but, Mr. Johnson, you have one,
and, Mrs. Johnson, you don't.

02:07.080 --> 02:11.080
You spray paint
a bathroom?!

02:11.080 --> 02:15.000
I burn your clothes.

02:23.920 --> 02:30.170
Now, for the fun part.
Give me your favorites.

02:30.170 --> 02:33.080
Oh, this is really
gonna hurt, guys!

02:33.080 --> 02:35.460
No.
Your real favorites,

02:35.460 --> 02:38.250
not the crap that
your mother buys you.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.330
Goodbye, yellow dress
and baseball bat

02:40.330 --> 02:42.420
that made me
feel like Beyoncé.

02:42.420 --> 02:44.290
Jack:
So long, camo pajamas.

02:44.290 --> 02:47.620
I guess I'll see you
in my dreams --

02:47.620 --> 02:49.540
unless I dream
about a forest.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.750
Let them burn!

02:51.750 --> 02:56.920
We raised you to follow rules
and obey authority.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.670
What got into you?

02:58.670 --> 03:00.210
We were just --

03:00.210 --> 03:03.040
Sit yo' five-dollar ass down
before I make change!

03:03.040 --> 03:05.120
We only did it because George
and Jar were doing it.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.580
Both: Ugh.
George and Jar?!

03:07.580 --> 03:10.250
They are a bad influence
on you guys.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.120
You can't
see them anymore.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.750
Oh, that won't be hard,
because you're grounded.

03:15.750 --> 03:18.420
For six months.

03:18.420 --> 03:21.960
Yeah!
Half a year, bitches!

03:21.960 --> 03:23.620
B-B-Babies!

03:23.620 --> 03:25.380
No, no, no,
stick with it.

03:25.380 --> 03:28.210
And that is the gist
of the American Revolution.

03:31.580 --> 03:34.330
Thank you for
your enthusiasm, Andre.

03:34.330 --> 03:36.250
All right, guys,
read chapter 13 for tomorrow.

03:41.210 --> 03:44.620
That was amazing.
I mean, there was just something

03:44.620 --> 03:46.330
about the way you taught it
that was, like,

03:46.330 --> 03:48.540
"Were we gonna be free
of British rule?

03:48.540 --> 03:50.040
I don't know!"

03:50.040 --> 03:53.420
Okay, I am gonna get
this monstrosity to the car.

03:53.420 --> 03:55.080
Can you believe it fits
in a hatchback?

03:55.080 --> 03:56.380
Well, um,
let me help you.

03:56.380 --> 03:59.420
I'm actually in the market
for a new whip.

03:59.420 --> 04:02.040
Really looking at
the hatchback brand.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.540
-Yeah.
-So, what kind of music
do you listen to?

04:04.540 --> 04:06.880
Um, I'm really into
'90s gangsta rap.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.460
Oh, yeah.

04:08.460 --> 04:10.750
What up? Whoo-hoo!
West side!

04:11.750 --> 04:13.330
Argh!
-Oh, my God.

04:13.330 --> 04:14.830
-Yeah.
-Okay.

04:14.830 --> 04:16.460
All right. Let's get this
to your car, yeah.

04:16.460 --> 04:17.750
Thank you.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.830
Whoo! Hey, guys.

04:19.830 --> 04:21.880
Whoa, you're in
a good mood.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.540
Why wouldn't I be?

04:23.540 --> 04:26.750
I finally broke my kids.
Mm!

04:26.750 --> 04:28.750
Why would you want
to break your children?

04:28.750 --> 04:31.040
So they could be better
at life.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.000
That never actually worked
for me, Dre.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.540
I mean, I tried to be
the authority figure, you know.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.960
Always saying stuff like,
"Hey, brush your teeth"

04:37.960 --> 04:40.040
or "They're going to ban you
from the mall".

04:40.040 --> 04:42.250
But if you're too strict
with your kids,

04:42.250 --> 04:44.710
they won't think
you're cool, you know.

04:44.710 --> 04:46.880
Boom!
-Whoa!

04:46.880 --> 04:48.330
Cool dab, Dad.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.620
Either your fly
or you're not fly.

04:50.620 --> 04:53.830
I don't care what my kids think.
They don't get to think.

04:53.830 --> 04:55.330
I think for them.

04:55.330 --> 04:58.460
I wish somebody would think
for me -- or even about me.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.920
I didn't get to have a thought
until I was 15

05:00.920 --> 05:03.620
and my mother was away
on a church weekend.

05:03.620 --> 05:05.920
Then, when she came home
and found out I was thinking,

05:05.920 --> 05:07.540
she slapped the thoughts
right out of me.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.790
Ooh.
Didn't think again
till college.

05:09.790 --> 05:11.920
Mm.
I didn't have my first thought

05:11.920 --> 05:14.250
until after
my mother died.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.830
Then I was slapped
by her ghost.

05:15.830 --> 05:17.420
You would think it'd go
right through you.

05:17.420 --> 05:19.170
It does not.

05:19.170 --> 05:21.580
Her ghost wore a ring.

05:21.580 --> 05:26.210
Okay, Charlie, how -- because
the ring is real and the ghost,

05:26.210 --> 05:28.290
it would just fall --
not work.

05:28.290 --> 05:31.790
No. It was a ring
from Tiffany's.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.000
Tiffany is dead, too.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.120
Thanks for the ride.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.380
So, did you like it?

05:42.380 --> 05:44.040
Like what?

05:44.040 --> 05:45.290
The Hyundai.

05:45.290 --> 05:48.380
I loved it.
Really hugs the road.

05:48.380 --> 05:50.670
-Yeah.
-Well, thanks for the ride.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.080
It -- The door sticks.
Here. Let me help you.

05:59.420 --> 06:00.420
Just trying to...

06:04.170 --> 06:07.250
What in
Luther Vandross' name?!

06:11.460 --> 06:13.670
Who was that
grown

06:13.670 --> 06:16.830
Oh, that's just Barbara,
my history teacher.

06:16.830 --> 06:19.000
Barbara?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.210
Oh, so, now we're calling
grown-ass teachers

06:21.210 --> 06:23.420
by their first names?

06:23.420 --> 06:24.960
Well, she likes
to be relatable.

06:24.960 --> 06:28.080
Oh, I'm sure she does.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.460
I saw the way she looked at you.
And when she leaned over

06:31.460 --> 06:35.670
to open the car door,
she lingered.

06:35.670 --> 06:38.920
She did not linger, Grandma.
Her -- Her door sticks.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.620
She's into you.

06:40.620 --> 06:43.460
Yeah, right. Grandma, you're
reading too much into things.

06:43.460 --> 06:47.500
Oh, no.
I know my lingerers.

06:47.500 --> 06:51.170
Hell, I linger.

06:52.540 --> 06:54.460
Even though I stopped
Jack and Diane

06:54.460 --> 06:56.830
from hanging out
with George and Jar,

06:56.830 --> 06:59.080
I still had to see
their dumb faces

06:59.080 --> 07:01.210
at the dumb science fair.

07:01.210 --> 07:04.460
And our next science project
is from George and Jar.

07:04.460 --> 07:08.420
♪♪

07:14.710 --> 07:17.420
Ugh. These two.

07:17.420 --> 07:18.790
You see what happens

07:18.790 --> 07:22.040
when your parents don't love you
enough to beat you?

07:22.040 --> 07:23.540
You're welcome.

07:23.540 --> 07:27.420
...just upload your drawing,
and the app we created

07:27.420 --> 07:29.580
will transform it into the style
of any artist.

07:29.580 --> 07:31.710
Want to paint
like Picasso?

07:31.710 --> 07:33.750
You just did it.

07:33.750 --> 07:34.790
Rembrandt!

07:38.580 --> 07:41.830
Basquiat!

07:41.830 --> 07:43.210
-Oh, my God.
-No way.

07:43.210 --> 07:44.500
I need this.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.540
Me, too.

07:45.540 --> 07:46.920
Boom!

07:46.920 --> 07:49.540
Okay, guys, guys.

07:49.540 --> 07:53.750
So, George and Jar's
idea is -- It's okay.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.250
Yeah?

07:55.250 --> 07:56.500
What -- What are you guys
presenting for next week?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.210
Ours is on a whole
nother level.

07:58.210 --> 07:59.210
Yeah.

07:59.210 --> 08:00.540
-Mm-hmm.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.250
-Okay.

08:02.250 --> 08:04.040
Baking soda volcano.

08:06.830 --> 08:08.120
Boom.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.790
Dre: I look good,
even with an apple face.

08:15.790 --> 08:16.750
Yeah.
This should be
our Christmas card.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.710
Yeah. Okay.

08:19.710 --> 08:24.080
George and Jar used coding,
art history, algorithms.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.460
Jack and Diane
are, like,

08:25.460 --> 08:27.920
two steps away from
being flat-earthers.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.880
Baking soda volcano.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.330
So dumb!

08:31.330 --> 08:33.710
I can't believe our kids
are thinking so small.

08:33.710 --> 08:34.830
Well, I can, Dre.

08:34.830 --> 08:36.080
Huh?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.500
You tell them
over and over again

08:38.500 --> 08:40.750
they shouldn't think
until college.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.670
You act like this house
is a communist country.

08:44.380 --> 08:46.210
By trying to make them perfect,
we've been holding them back.

08:46.210 --> 08:48.290
Yeah. God.

08:48.290 --> 08:51.250
You know, this is
straight out of that article

08:51.250 --> 08:52.540
that I e-mailed you.

08:52.540 --> 08:53.670
Yes.

08:53.670 --> 08:54.830
Straight out
of that article.

08:57.710 --> 08:58.830
You didn't read it,
did you?

08:58.830 --> 09:00.790
Ah, damn it, Bow,
you e-mail me so much.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.210
"

09:03.210 --> 09:05.210
Uh, "Junior's
still waiting."

09:05.210 --> 09:07.880
"There's a strange man who
dropped Junior off in a van."

09:07.880 --> 09:13.120
Well, anyway, the article
was saying that Black children

09:13.120 --> 09:15.330
are more afraid of authority,
afraid to take risks.

09:15.330 --> 09:17.170
-Mm-hmm.
-I just -- I think we should

09:17.170 --> 09:19.790
loosen our grip
on our children,

09:19.790 --> 09:22.380
and then, maybe, they can
become innovators.

09:22.380 --> 09:23.460
-Hmm.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.420
Maybe one of them is
the next Steve Jobs.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.420
-I love Steve Jobs.
-I know.

09:29.420 --> 09:32.580
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the future.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.330
I-I've asked you
a million times

09:35.330 --> 09:37.330
not to dress like this
when Microsoft is here.

09:38.710 --> 09:39.960
Dress like what?

09:39.960 --> 09:41.380
Great news, guys.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.000
You're no longer grounded.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.210
We are giving you
the freedom to go out

09:45.210 --> 09:46.290
and win this
science fair.

09:46.290 --> 09:47.830
Doesn't that sound great?

09:47.830 --> 09:50.170
-Mm-hmm.

09:50.170 --> 09:51.620
Are we allowed
to talk?

09:51.620 --> 09:52.750
Diane:
I don't know.

09:52.750 --> 09:53.750
This feels like a trap.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.000
No. No, no, no.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.920
We want you to talk and think
and have a voice.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.790
-Yes!
-Your voice matters.

09:59.790 --> 10:01.500
It matters, guys.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.830
-Aww!
-Uh-huh.

10:02.830 --> 10:03.710
That's so nice.

10:03.710 --> 10:04.710
Yes!

10:04.710 --> 10:05.830
Definitely a trap.

10:05.830 --> 10:07.620
No, no.

10:07.620 --> 10:09.880
Guys, go!

10:09.880 --> 10:14.670
-Yes.
-Go! Just dream. Discover!

10:14.670 --> 10:17.170
And if you are gonna
do a volcano,

10:17.170 --> 10:19.670
don't just build
the volcano...

10:19.670 --> 10:23.380
-Mnh-mnh.
-...be the volcano! Psssh!

10:23.380 --> 10:27.170
Do whatever you want to do,
just as long as it's cooler...

10:27.170 --> 10:28.790
-Mm-hmm.
-...than George and Jar.

10:28.790 --> 10:31.040
Please.
Like, seriously, please.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.040
Mm-hmm.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.420
So, did you dump
your little girlfriend?

10:35.420 --> 10:37.710
She's not
my girlfriend.

10:37.710 --> 10:41.290
But if I'm being honest,
I think I might have a shot.

10:41.290 --> 10:44.330
Junior: She asked me to stay
after class to erase the board,

10:44.330 --> 10:47.750
but I think she was
coming on to me.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.000
It's nice to have
a tall guy around.

10:51.460 --> 10:53.380
Yeah, somebody
has a shot --

10:53.380 --> 10:55.620
your teacher...
at jail.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.170
Let me tell you
a little story.

11:03.170 --> 11:07.380
Once upon a time, Grandma was
a sophomore in high school

11:07.380 --> 11:09.500
and fully developed.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.500
Ew.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.580
Male teachers noticed,

11:13.580 --> 11:15.750
especially Mr. Whittset.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.880
Now, I noticed him
noticing me,

11:18.880 --> 11:23.040
and one night,
we noticed a movie.

11:23.040 --> 11:27.040
To make a long story short,
he lost his kids,

11:27.040 --> 11:31.580
and thanks to me, my school
didn't have a math department.

11:31.580 --> 11:34.000
Now, do you get
what I'm saying?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.420
You know I don't.

11:36.420 --> 11:40.330
Stay away
from Ms. Barbara.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.580
I'm not gonna
let you murder someone's husband

11:42.580 --> 11:45.080
so your teacher can get out
of a bad marriage.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.080
Now get up
and get on out of here!

11:47.080 --> 11:49.460
Pull your pants up!

11:51.210 --> 11:52.710
Hello, wunderkinds.

11:52.710 --> 11:54.250
Hey, hey, hey!

11:54.250 --> 11:57.750
What is cooking up in
the imagination station, huh?

11:57.750 --> 11:59.670
Come on, man, you don't
have to work at the desk.

11:59.670 --> 12:01.420

12:11.830 --> 12:13.750

12:17.120 --> 12:19.210
Uh, are you guys

12:19.210 --> 12:20.330
-No!
-Mnh-mnh.

12:20.330 --> 12:22.040
All right, we're just saying
"Be free."

12:22.040 --> 12:23.290
-Yeah.
-You can do anything.

12:23.290 --> 12:25.250
-Anything.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.500
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.380
So, I can wear my Nike shorts
with my Adidas slides?

12:29.380 --> 12:30.540
Yeah.
Yes, yes, yes -- no --

12:30.540 --> 12:32.040
-Ah, hell no...
-No, baby --

12:32.040 --> 12:33.920
Babe, innovators don't need to
match their athletic gear.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.290
He's not innovating!

12:37.290 --> 12:39.500
Okay, this is gonna be
tougher than I thought.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.710
-Dre...

12:40.710 --> 12:44.040

-Okay.

12:44.040 --> 12:47.330
Dre: Our kids had been coloring
inside the lines for so long...

12:47.330 --> 12:50.120
-Unh-unh.
-...we needed to jump-start
their creativity.

12:52.960 --> 12:56.880
Outside the box.

12:56.880 --> 13:00.880
Ah, much better.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.620

13:02.620 --> 13:05.830
...we've been pacing for two
hours. Are you sure this works?

13:05.830 --> 13:09.380
This is how everyone brainstorms
in Silicon Valley, all right?

13:09.380 --> 13:12.210
If you have a static body,
you have a static mind.

13:12.210 --> 13:13.620
I think I'm gonna
pass out.

13:13.620 --> 13:15.040
Great. Use it.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.290
The best ideas come
in a dream state.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.210
I'm dream-walking
right now.

13:19.210 --> 13:21.380
Our plan was working.

13:21.380 --> 13:24.380
Our kids were turning
into free thinkers.

13:24.380 --> 13:26.330
Here, sign this.

13:26.330 --> 13:29.330
We got detention
for thinking too freely.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.170
Okay, today we're gonna read
"Sounder."

13:33.380 --> 13:34.960
We just read
"Old Yeller."

13:34.960 --> 13:38.540
Seems like we've been reading
a lot of novels about dead dogs.

13:38.540 --> 13:41.210
How come we're not reading
novels written by dead dogs?

13:41.210 --> 13:42.540
Are you on drugs?

13:42.540 --> 13:44.670
Are you?

13:44.670 --> 13:46.120
Now I feel like
I want to do drugs again,

13:46.120 --> 13:47.790
if I'm being real
with y'all.

13:47.790 --> 13:50.920
Normally,
I would be pissed...

13:50.920 --> 13:52.120
but I'm proud of you!

13:53.460 --> 13:57.120
But next time,
question White authority.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.120
But this is
a good start.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.830
-All right.
-Come on.

14:01.830 --> 14:05.540
Bring it in.
Bring it in. Aah!

So, when it was
Jack and Diane's turn

14:07.500 --> 14:09.290
to present
at STEM Sunday,

14:09.290 --> 14:11.750
we knew they were going to
blow everyone away,

14:11.750 --> 14:14.250
and we'd record
every minute of it.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.170
Volcano.

14:18.170 --> 14:21.120
Triggered by the convergence
or the divergence

14:21.120 --> 14:23.380

tectonic plates.

14:23.380 --> 14:28.420
Gases and magma
erupt through a vent.

14:28.420 --> 14:29.750
Please stand by.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.420

an eruption.

of the body's tectonic plates.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.960
Emotions erupt
through a vent.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.920
Hormones.
Boy crushes. Enemies.

spread to -- Yep, mm-hmm.

20:41.580 --> 20:43.670
Diane got it, too.

20:43.670 --> 20:48.080
I have 900 unread e-mails
from your mommy.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.460
Oh.
You know what?

20:51.460 --> 20:55.330
Uh, Devante --
No! No, Devante!

20:55.330 --> 20:58.500
No. Don't you put your hands
on my keyboard.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.750
What?
Drag that to the trash?

21:00.750 --> 21:02.460
Mnh-mnh! N--

21:02.460 --> 21:06.540
Uh-oh! You deleted them.

21:06.540 --> 21:09.080
You're such a good boy.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.170
So advanced.
You know what?

21:11.170 --> 21:14.750
You're gonna be
the next Steve Jobs.

21:14.750 --> 21:17.830
Let's go find you
a turtleneck.

21:17.830 --> 21:19.620
How do you
get out of here?

21:19.620 --> 21:20.960
It's cool.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.250
I know how to do it.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.500
Let's go.
