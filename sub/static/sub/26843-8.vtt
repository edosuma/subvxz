- And since we all have
a different talent

08:26.133 --> 08:29.000

I thought we could have

33:51.633 --> 33:55.533
[all]
- Cheers.

33:57.600 --> 34:03.200
♪♪♪

34:03.233 --> 34:04.133
- Damn it.

34:04.166 --> 34:05.667
I thought Porsha
was with child.

34:05.700 --> 34:08.667
I hope that she's not drinking
Hennessey with child.

34:08.700 --> 34:10.400
- I would never.

34:10.433 --> 34:11.667
- We were wrong.

34:11.700 --> 34:13.667
The only thing that Porsha
is having is Hennessey.

34:13.700 --> 34:15.667
[laughing]
She's not having a baby.

34:15.700 --> 34:16.767
The bottle don't lie.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.467
- So, y'all been--
y'all been plottin'.

34:18.500 --> 34:19.700
- No.

34:19.734 --> 34:20.600
- Well, no, we had--
we had a massage earlier.

34:20.633 --> 34:21.767
I was like,
"Wait a minute.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.166
"At the gas station,
Porsha wanted a pickle."

34:24.200 --> 34:25.567
- Wait.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.400
Carmen San Diego over here
thinks that Porsha is pregnant

34:28.433 --> 34:29.533
'cause she
wanted a pickle?

34:29.567 --> 34:31.000
- No, it was one of
those big pickles.

34:31.033 --> 34:32.333
- I get it.

34:32.367 --> 34:33.633
Pregnant girls
eat pickles.

34:33.667 --> 34:36.400
But you also gotta remember
that Porsha a hood girl.

34:36.433 --> 34:37.633
You can pick 'em up.
They cost a dollar.

34:37.667 --> 34:38.734
They come in a little bag.

34:38.767 --> 34:40.633
You can get spicy,
garlic, or regular.

34:40.667 --> 34:41.600
It's real good.

34:41.633 --> 34:42.767
Believe me.
I know.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.700
- You know, the whole
alcohol cleanse

34:44.734 --> 34:46.467
came from the
keto diet.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.433
Just one lie
begets another.

34:48.467 --> 34:50.233
And so, that's why
I really kept to it.

34:50.266 --> 34:51.200
- Oh.

34:51.233 --> 34:52.467
- But they're
eatin' it up.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.600
So, ladies and gentlemen,
that's how it's done.

34:55.633 --> 34:57.367
- What kinda purse is that?
Um--

34:57.400 --> 34:58.567
- Charlotte Olympia.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.734
- Oh, it's so cute.

34:59.767 --> 35:01.600
- I went to your room
and got a purse.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.567
- I was wonderin'.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.667
- I said, I'm not longer
taking tips from you.

35:05.700 --> 35:07.567
I'm going to the
fashion goddess here.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.700
- Oh, that's one
of her purses?

35:08.734 --> 35:09.767
- We had a moment.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.533
You know, we got dressed.

35:11.567 --> 35:14.633
What if you did, like,
a pop of color or something?

35:14.667 --> 35:16.633
I feel like
that's so great.

35:16.667 --> 35:18.300
- Oh, my God.

35:18.333 --> 35:21.567
I wanted some advice
on some accessories.

35:24.467 --> 35:26.400
- But I never said
I was an accessory queen.

35:26.433 --> 35:29.433
I think she just
respects the style.

35:29.467 --> 35:32.400
- We also talked about

35:32.433 --> 35:35.700
how Miss Marlo
came into my room

35:35.734 --> 35:37.567
and wanted to
dress me today.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.333
- Yes.

35:39.367 --> 35:41.600
- And how that made me feel.
- Okay, love and light.

35:41.633 --> 35:44.500
- I mean, we know that
you're the fashionista,

35:44.533 --> 35:47.467
but your crown has been
taken away today.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.333
- I don't think
it's been taken away.

35:49.367 --> 35:50.667
- I don't think it's
been taken away, either.

35:50.700 --> 35:52.433
- It's another fashionista that
can definitely save you.

35:52.467 --> 35:53.767
You're in good hands.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.266
With anyone at this table,
you're in good hands with.

35:55.300 --> 35:57.033
- Anyone in good hands?
I don't know about anybody.

35:57.066 --> 35:58.367
- Well, anyone at this table
can dress you

35:58.400 --> 36:01.433
better than
how you come.

36:01.467 --> 36:03.400
- They do-- bitch, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

36:03.433 --> 36:04.567
- Uh-oh.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.500
- Okay, now we're not
gonna go bitch, now.

36:06.533 --> 36:07.767
- I'm sorry, bitch.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.567
That came out at the wrong
time, and it wasn't--

36:10.600 --> 36:12.367
didn't need to
get to that level.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.767
I do apologize.

36:14.000 --> 36:14.767

my food first.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.667
- Okay, 'cause
that wasn't right.

36:19.767 --> 36:21.500
Those smirk
little comments--

36:21.533 --> 36:23.000
- I'm gonna say
what the hell I want.

36:23.033 --> 36:23.767
I'm in America.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
I'm not calling
out your name.

36:25.033 --> 36:26.166
- Okay, okay,
and that-and that--

36:26.200 --> 36:27.500
- That's what you're
gonna do, is be a lady.

36:27.533 --> 36:28.400
- Okay, but you're gonna
have respect for me, as well.

okay, well,

36:29.734 --> 36:31.000
don't call me a b-i-t-c-h
anymore either, okay?

All right.

- Right, whatever, bitch.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.066
Said it, again.

- Bitch.

36:39.667 --> 36:41.266
- Oh, my goodness.

36:45.767 --> 36:46.100
♪♪♪

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
- Whatever, bitch.

36:50.033 --> 36:51.734
- Say it one more time.

36:51.767 --> 36:53.567
- Bitch.

36:55.734 --> 36:57.066

36:57.100 --> 36:58.567

36:59.734 --> 37:01.033
don't talk about
their mamas, now.

37:01.066 --> 37:02.734
- Okay, no, I will.
Your mama the bitch.

37:02.767 --> 37:04.433
- So, we're just gonna
keep going back and forth

37:04.467 --> 37:06.133
like we're in high school
and call each other bitches.

37:06.166 --> 37:07.367
Okay, cool.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.700
- Shamari, hold on, now,

37:08.734 --> 37:11.467
'cause I know Marlo about
to get your ass together.

37:11.500 --> 37:14.100
Where Marlo from, when I say,
"Your mama a bitch,"

37:14.133 --> 37:15.400
it's on.

37:15.433 --> 37:16.734
Let's go.

37:16.767 --> 37:18.600
- Anyone that knows me,
in my 42 years on this earth,

37:18.633 --> 37:20.033
knows me from fashion.

37:20.066 --> 37:22.333
So, it's just you
coming here being catty.

37:22.367 --> 37:23.433
- Catty?

37:23.467 --> 37:24.734
- I don't even know
what that's from.

37:24.767 --> 37:26.533
- I mean, it just
seemed like,

37:26.567 --> 37:28.433
I mean, earlier today,
I mean, I just took it

37:28.467 --> 37:30.600
that Shamari just didn't
like the approach.

37:30.633 --> 37:31.767
You know what I'm saying?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.133
- That's what I was saying,
the delivery.

37:33.166 --> 37:34.433
- Everybody's coming
on me with my fashion.

37:34.467 --> 37:36.200
- I never said anything
about your fashion.

37:36.233 --> 37:37.433
- No, NeNe, you haven't,

37:37.467 --> 37:39.033
but, like, I was
just saying that

37:39.066 --> 37:42.667
when we had the
competition, she won.

37:42.700 --> 37:45.367
- You only won because you
sung a religious song.

37:45.400 --> 37:48.467
Okay, sweetheart?
Your voice is awful.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.633
- My voice is awful?

37:50.667 --> 37:54.567
- Marlo, she goes hard when
she's arguing with someone,

37:54.600 --> 37:56.600
but my girl can sing.

37:56.633 --> 37:58.367
Now, you can't take
that away from her.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.200
Shamari can sing
her butt off.

38:00.233 --> 38:01.567
- Let me see you
do what I did.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.633
- I don't sing.
Let me see--

38:03.667 --> 38:05.166
let me see you
do this, darling.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.300
- Okay, so, how is
my voice awful, honey?

38:06.333 --> 38:09.467
I done sold over 5 million
records, honey.

38:09.500 --> 38:10.734
- Sweetie,
that's not in my lane.

38:10.767 --> 38:12.700
- You can Google me
back to the 19's, honey.

38:12.734 --> 38:15.133
I was a A-list
when you was alias.

38:15.166 --> 38:17.233
- Girl, that was back then.
What are you now?

38:17.266 --> 38:18.533
- Look, it doesn't
matter, honey.

38:18.567 --> 38:19.633
Who discovered you?

38:19.667 --> 38:21.200
You got new money.
Who discovered you?

38:21.233 --> 38:22.633
- Girl, new money?
- Yes, new money, honey.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.500
- Girl, I've been that
girl in the hood.

38:24.533 --> 38:25.767
- I been had that sh--.

38:26.000 --> 38:26.767
- Okay, well, get new money
and get new braces.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.133
- You got the fake teeth.

38:28.166 --> 38:29.667
- I've never had
fake teeth, sweetie.

38:29.700 --> 38:31.533
Never braces
or fake teeth.

38:31.567 --> 38:33.500
- You are dismissed.
Go play in traffic.

38:33.533 --> 38:35.400
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

38:35.433 --> 38:37.200
Bye.

38:37.233 --> 38:40.100
- Marlo seems to have
something to say about
everybody's fashion.

38:40.133 --> 38:41.133
Like, everyone.

38:41.166 --> 38:43.000
But one thing
about Miss Shamari.

38:43.033 --> 38:44.567
Don't let this little
chihuahua fool you, honey.

38:44.600 --> 38:45.767
She will get you.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.633
- Okay, you guys,
you know what?

38:47.667 --> 38:50.000
If someone is okay with
the way that they look,

38:50.033 --> 38:51.467
they're okay with the way
that they look.

38:51.500 --> 38:52.767
So stop it, okay?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.433
'Cause that's
really unnecessary.

38:54.467 --> 38:55.600
- But I have
something to say.

38:55.633 --> 38:57.133
Because I feel like
I came into this group,

38:57.166 --> 38:59.500
and I was given
the label "fashion",

38:59.533 --> 39:00.667
"label girl".

39:00.700 --> 39:03.734
- I will give a fashion
shout out to Tanya.

39:03.767 --> 39:05.667
If I put that type of,
you know,

39:05.700 --> 39:07.734
label situation
on wardrobe,

39:07.767 --> 39:09.667
I love the way
she puts it together.

39:09.700 --> 39:12.066
- I never said that
a label makes an outfit.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.100
I like them.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.633
As you saw in my
presentation today,

39:15.667 --> 39:17.233
you can do a little
bit of everything.

39:17.266 --> 39:18.667
You can do a lot
with a little.

39:18.700 --> 39:20.533
- You know, I want you
to understand, Tanya,

39:20.567 --> 39:23.500
that I have very little
tolerance for ignorance.

39:24.667 --> 39:26.233
- Ignorance?
That's a strong word.

39:26.266 --> 39:27.633
- I'm just telling you,

39:27.667 --> 39:31.000
my tolerance are very small
for ignorant conversations.

39:31.033 --> 39:32.166
Because you wear labels,

39:32.200 --> 39:34.200
and you say that
you are fashion,

39:34.233 --> 39:37.033
just know that you may
be fashion in your eyes.

39:37.066 --> 39:39.533
It doesn't mean that you
are fashion in my eyes.

39:39.567 --> 39:41.500
Tanya, to me,
is comin' off like,

39:41.533 --> 39:44.300
girl, what you're wearing this
evening ain't even slaying.

39:44.333 --> 39:46.000
Okay, you might've
won the competition,

39:46.033 --> 39:48.033
but this ain't
slayin', honey.

39:48.066 --> 39:50.166
I have man'tay of
fashions, honey.

39:50.200 --> 39:52.166
So, she doesn't have
anything that I don't.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.500
- But it's not
a competition.

39:53.533 --> 39:55.467
- But you talk about it
like it's a competition.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.734
- We had a competition,
so I had to compete.

39:57.767 --> 40:00.533
- I don't understand
what's going on here, NeNe.

40:00.567 --> 40:02.567
Why are you being
jealous of Tanya?

40:02.600 --> 40:04.233
- You need to come
into my closet, babe.

40:04.266 --> 40:06.567
I will shut yours all
the way the (BLEEP) down.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.066
- I haven't seen it.
I haven't seen it.

40:08.100 --> 40:10.166
- Well, I've seen yours,
and I will shut yours down.

40:10.200 --> 40:13.700
- Okay, girl, somebody else
can get a little bit of shine

40:13.734 --> 40:15.533
other than you, boo.

40:15.567 --> 40:17.667
- I own stores.
I have fashions.

40:17.700 --> 40:19.667
I'm a serial entrepreneur.

40:19.700 --> 40:21.533
And I'm a successful
black woman.

40:21.567 --> 40:22.767
- So, here's the thing.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.500
NeNe is throwing
a lotta shade at Tanya

40:25.533 --> 40:27.133
because of the
glasses comment.

40:27.166 --> 40:29.767
But, girl, come on.
It's not that serious.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.533
- Here's to successful
black women.

40:31.567 --> 40:33.567
Yes, for the successful
black women in the room.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.100
- Cheers.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.166
- And I will not address
anyone else who doesn't want--

40:37.200 --> 40:40.300
I will not address you
ever again about fashion.

40:40.333 --> 40:42.233
- It's really funny to me
how Shamari, like,

40:42.266 --> 40:44.700
takes it to heart
about fashion,

40:44.734 --> 40:47.567
and you said that Dennis
looked like a leprechaun

40:47.600 --> 40:49.767
[laughter]
in his green jacket.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.600
- Hi, Dennis.

40:51.633 --> 40:52.734
- Hello.

40:52.767 --> 40:54.266
[laughing]

40:54.300 --> 40:57.700
- Girl, Shamari had called
him doggone a leprechaun.

40:57.734 --> 40:59.734
- No, she did not!

40:59.767 --> 41:00.734
- Wait a minute.

41:00.767 --> 41:02.100
All he was missing,

41:02.133 --> 41:04.233
was the top hat and
the floor leaf clover.

41:04.266 --> 41:05.734
- That's what you said?

41:05.767 --> 41:07.266
- Oh, my God.

41:07.300 --> 41:08.667
- You are awful.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.266
- No, Halloween is my
favorite time of year.

41:14.333 --> 41:15.266
- Wait.

41:15.300 --> 41:16.633
[laughing]

41:16.667 --> 41:18.100
- He ain't worried
about his brows, honey.

41:18.133 --> 41:20.266
He don't need 'em.
He's a legend.

41:20.300 --> 41:21.700
- I know I have
Go Naked hair,

41:21.734 --> 41:23.767
but maybe I should
start Go Naked eyebrows,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.300
'cause Ronnie could be
my first customer for sure.

41:26.333 --> 41:28.133
[laughter]
We're just playin'.

41:28.166 --> 41:29.633
It's just playin'.

41:29.667 --> 41:31.000
- Fun shade!
Fun shade!

41:31.033 --> 41:32.000
- Fun shade.

41:32.033 --> 41:34.000
Fun shade.
- Fun shade.

41:34.033 --> 41:37.100
- Ladies, let me just
stand up and say...

41:37.133 --> 41:38.467
[chuckles]

41:38.500 --> 41:42.066
thank you for joining NeNe
"Fair" Leakes this weekend,

41:42.100 --> 41:44.100
honey, out here
in Florida.

41:44.133 --> 41:45.600
Yes, we bond.

41:45.633 --> 41:47.300
Yes, thank you guys
for coming.

41:47.333 --> 41:49.233
Raise your glass.

41:49.266 --> 41:52.133
I think this was a
really great vacation.

41:52.166 --> 41:55.133
We had to iron out a few
issues, but we did that.

41:55.166 --> 41:56.133
Fun times.

41:56.166 --> 41:58.266
Cheers, cheers,
cheers, cheers.

41:58.300 --> 42:01.033
And I am proud of each
and every last one of them.

42:01.066 --> 42:03.700
Even the ones
with small minds.

42:03.734 --> 42:07.000
- Here's to getting
to know everyone.

42:07.033 --> 42:10.133
- And we almost made it
without any major drama.

42:10.166 --> 42:13.133
- Oh, God,
we almost made it.

42:15.300 --> 42:18.100
- Next time, on "The Real
Housewives of Atlanta"...

42:18.133 --> 42:20.166
- Who is this heifer
that called me a bitch?

42:20.200 --> 42:22.166
- Well, you don't
gotta worry about her.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.667
- Those are fightin'
words where I come from.

42:23.700 --> 42:24.767
- Cheers to that.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.166
[laughing]

42:26.200 --> 42:27.567
- She's gorgeous.

42:27.600 --> 42:31.100
- One little, small request.
I just want ten pounds off.

42:34.066 --> 42:35.433
- He haven't been talkin'
like that, lately.

42:35.467 --> 42:37.200
When I said "lemon",

42:37.233 --> 42:40.166
I'm thinkin'
that's her as a lemon.

42:40.200 --> 42:43.166
- So, this is going
in the vagina, okay?

42:43.200 --> 42:44.433
- Is that a condom?

42:44.467 --> 42:46.200
- Yes, Dennis, this is
what a condom looks like.

42:46.233 --> 42:49.166
[laughter]

42:49.200 --> 42:50.367
[sobbing]

42:50.400 --> 42:51.700
- Stop.
You're gonna be fine.

42:51.734 --> 42:56.300
- I can't.
I can't go.

42:56.333 --> 42:59.000
