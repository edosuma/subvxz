00:01.501 --> 00:02.917
<i>Previously on</i> SEAL Team...

00:02.941 --> 00:04.379
Will you go to work one day

00:04.462 --> 00:06.256
and never come home?

00:06.339 --> 00:08.235
- Sonny Quinn.
- In the flesh.

00:08.341 --> 00:09.818
You are still my son.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.761
I stopped being your son
the day that Mama died.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.430
<i>Clay was about to tell us</i>

00:13.513 --> 00:14.639
about STA-21.

00:14.723 --> 00:15.890
I accepted Lindell's offer.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.161
You want to change paths, that's
what you're gonna do, fine.

00:19.185 --> 00:20.228
Pack your bags.

00:20.311 --> 00:21.604
You're heading to COP Redding.

00:21.688 --> 00:22.998
Jack Daniels!
He's got the same watch on

00:23.022 --> 00:24.149
I gave him last time, huh?

00:24.232 --> 00:25.483
<i>War needs men like us.</i>

00:25.567 --> 00:27.444
Men like us need war.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.321
<i>- We lost a brother today.
- Jack Daniels.</i>

01:09.736 --> 01:11.154
<i>The key leader</i>

01:11.237 --> 01:13.656
engagement massacre
was only the beginning.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.991
In the ensuing two weeks,

01:15.074 --> 01:16.868
there have been three
similar attacks

01:16.951 --> 01:19.704
on Taliban leaders involved
in the treaty negotiations.

01:19.788 --> 01:23.666
Most recently, a VBIED detonated
in a Kabul public square,

01:23.750 --> 01:28.213
killing three senior Taliban
figures and 12 bystanders,

01:28.296 --> 01:29.672
including two
American journalists.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.342
These acts threaten to undermine
the treaty process

01:32.425 --> 01:34.010
meant to bring stability
to this region.

01:34.093 --> 01:36.721
They will not go unanswered.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.859
<i>The apparent mastermind</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:51.694
<i>behind these attacks
is Taliban tribal elder</i>

01:51.778 --> 01:54.197
Akhtar Zahed,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.366
a vocal opponent
in the Taliban's efforts

01:56.449 --> 01:58.034
to broker peace
with the U.S.

01:58.117 --> 02:01.162
Zahed's gone underground
since the KLE massacre,

02:01.246 --> 02:04.207
but the nature of his crimes
should limit his options

02:04.290 --> 02:06.417
for travel and safe haven
within the Taliban network.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.211
Latest intel indicates
he remains

02:08.294 --> 02:09.356
<i>in Jalalabad.</i>

02:10.547 --> 02:12.027
- Not our guy.
- Cuff him.

02:12.131 --> 02:14.259
Jump back in the stack.
Let's move. Move!

02:16.803 --> 02:19.556
Get him! Get him!

02:21.683 --> 02:23.620
Go get him!

02:25.436 --> 02:27.897
There's no one. Empty.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.650
Ah, they must've
just been in there.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.418
Out! Move!
Get him out, Ray.

02:48.501 --> 02:49.750
I got him. Come on.

02:49.774 --> 02:51.045
Get him out.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.815
Havoc, this is 1,
passing Cherokee and Jackpot.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.067
Got him. Yep.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.341
Got him?

02:57.218 --> 02:58.970
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

02:59.053 --> 03:02.765
ISR shows two trucks carrying
what appears to be six armed

03:02.849 --> 03:04.434
fighting-age males
approaching your pos.

03:04.517 --> 03:05.560
How copy?

03:05.643 --> 03:07.228
Copy that, Havoc.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.124
Move!

03:15.194 --> 03:16.613
Got enemy inbound.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.550
- Ray, set security.
- Yep!

03:18.656 --> 03:20.175
You're gonna tell 'em,
you're gonna get out there

03:20.199 --> 03:22.452
and you're gonna tell your men
to back off

03:22.535 --> 03:23.935
or my air support's
gonna melt them.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.599
- Those are not my men.
- Call them off!

03:25.705 --> 03:26.623
They are not here to save me.

03:26.706 --> 03:27.934
Down.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.692
'Bout a dozen enemy
clocking us from the back.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.145
What's the play?

03:49.228 --> 03:51.314
We got fewer enemy down here,
plus it looks like

03:51.397 --> 03:53.149
enough room to get past.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.985
That's the play. Thirty,
you get the rear with the boys.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.709
Me and Ray will work
this problem. Got it?

03:57.737 --> 03:59.530
Got it.

04:05.244 --> 04:07.497
Ready!

04:07.580 --> 04:09.207
Move vehicles!
Move, move, move, move!

04:29.060 --> 04:30.645
Havoc, this is 1.

04:30.728 --> 04:33.022
We pass Navajo. RTB.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.984
Well, Bravo 1, you got your war.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.041
Hey, Brock, give it
a rest, will you?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.477
- Come have a drink, huh?
- Yeah, let me

04:53.501 --> 04:55.221
Just finish working
these odor drills quick.

04:55.294 --> 04:56.815
- Wow.
- Pooch misses once,

04:56.921 --> 04:58.481
And he's going full
Bobby Knight on him.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.509
Dog's good.
So is Bravo.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.153
Bravo's back.
How 'bout that op, boys, huh?

05:03.177 --> 05:04.613
- Yeah!
- Come on. That's the way to crush, right?

05:04.637 --> 05:05.865
- Yes, sir.
- Full Metal.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.117
For a second there, it looked
like we'd bag the bogeyman

05:08.141 --> 05:10.452
- without firing a shot.
- Yeah, I'm glad it was just for a second.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.894
It's good to get our war on.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.230
It's finally something worth
shaving our legs for.

05:14.313 --> 05:16.001
- Hey!
- Oh! Did...

05:16.107 --> 05:18.067
Stop playing. Hey. Hey.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.236
We can only hope.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.739
Man, this PG version of
Ray Perry is a lot less fun

05:22.822 --> 05:25.867
than the wild man I knew
who ate lead for breakfast.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.369
I hate to disappoint you,
Thirty, but I've evolved, so...

05:28.453 --> 05:30.348
- He's evolved.
- Yeah? You evolved

05:30.455 --> 05:31.891
Into Mr. Belvedere.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.393
Hey, hey.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.836
So with this guy captured,
do peace talks continue?

05:36.919 --> 05:39.213
I-I just can't help
but thinking that, uh,

05:39.297 --> 05:40.691
we're putting ourselves
out of business here.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.300
I hope not.

05:42.383 --> 05:43.863
I ain't going back
to art school, man.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.320
The war is not over.
We're not going anywhere.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.220
You understand?

05:46.304 --> 05:48.264
There's plenty for us to do
around here.

05:48.347 --> 05:49.932
Well, sucks Clay and Sonny

05:50.016 --> 05:51.059
had to miss this one.

05:51.142 --> 05:51.893
Any word from Spenser?

05:51.976 --> 05:53.246
Nope.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.562
That Army outpost is at

05:54.645 --> 05:56.165
the edge of the world.
The communication's spotty.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.398
We'll hear from him soon.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.401
Okay, look, it doesn't matter
who's here or who's not here.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.279
Bottom line is, once the Agency
slices into that guy,

06:03.362 --> 06:05.281
we will be grinding.

06:05.364 --> 06:07.700
I can promise you that, so,
cheers, get it up.

06:07.784 --> 06:07.760
- Yeah.
- Be strong.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.619
All right.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.346
Let's grind it out there,
Full Metal.

06:20.379 --> 06:23.007
Come on, Spenser,
you're up next.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.468
Yeah.
No, hard pass, Kopel.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.805
Teenaged grunts putting holes in
me is something I try and avoid.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.199
Ah, you're gonna want something
to remember us by

06:30.223 --> 06:31.450
when you leave in a couple days.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.702
Not a bloodborne disease and his
girlfriend's name misspelled.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.812
That was one time, Lieutenant.

06:35.895 --> 06:38.356
I think "Mee-gan" and
"Step-anie" would beg to differ.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.318
Mounds, quiet but deadly.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.987
What do you have left to
complete on your task list

06:45.071 --> 06:47.156
before heading back to J-Bad?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.717
Checked off
the outpost's combat readiness.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.535
Site-surveyed
most of the battle space.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.329
Just... just one thing left.

06:53.412 --> 06:55.498
Recon on that Taliban village.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.667
Not letting that one go.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.436
My order's to do a full
assessment of the area.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.878
Thought we could
night patrol down,

07:00.962 --> 07:02.755
get some photos at daybreak.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.216
Trying that hike again? I'm in.

07:05.299 --> 07:08.678
Why, you hoping Batman's gonna
let you carry his cape?

07:08.761 --> 07:10.739
Same squad of locals who've been
mortaring the outpost

07:10.763 --> 07:12.908
every other day will hit us
as soon as we step off base.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.183
It's not happening.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.519
I've been mapping the points

07:16.602 --> 07:17.478
they've been shelling us from.

07:17.562 --> 07:21.065
There's a-a pattern
to their positions.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.902
Now, I'd be willing to bet
that they hit us

07:24.986 --> 07:26.988
tonight from this ridge
right here.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.535
You really believe that?

07:32.618 --> 07:35.538
Enough to take my rifle up to
higher ground and wait for them.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.708
All right. Guys already think
you're the Dark Knight.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.668
Now you gotta be
Nostradamus, too?

07:42.086 --> 07:43.379
Well...

07:44.589 --> 07:45.882
You caught a bad guy?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.550
We sure did, baby girl.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.486
A bad guy who was making it
difficult for everyone

07:49.510 --> 07:51.053
to play nice together.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.513
That's good, right?

07:52.597 --> 07:53.931
So now everyone's friends there?

07:54.015 --> 07:56.267
You can come home?

07:56.350 --> 07:58.019
Not just yet,<i> azizam.</i>

07:58.102 --> 08:00.062
I gotta be here
a little while longer.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.231
But Daddy's being safe,

08:02.315 --> 08:03.397
and we're gonna talk soon.

08:03.421 --> 08:04.525
Okay.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.987
I don't want you to die, Daddy.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.543
Man was a hundred proof,
no chaser.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.589
Yeah, he was.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.424
That's for sure.
Smooth, right?

08:28.507 --> 08:29.759
First time

08:29.842 --> 08:32.428
I met Jack, back in '06,
he says,

08:32.510 --> 08:37.265
"Chaplain Walker, if you are
trained in exorcisms,

08:37.350 --> 08:39.559
I'd like to introduce you
to my wife."

08:39.644 --> 08:42.438
You've been on the train
for a long time.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.774
Any friend of Jack's
a friend of mine.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.777
Jason Hayes. You
remember me, right?

08:47.860 --> 08:48.963
- Of course. Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:49.070 --> 08:53.282
Steel-trap memory's more of a
curse than a gift around here.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.365
That's for sure.

08:54.389 --> 08:55.409
Yeah.

08:55.493 --> 08:58.788
Every name, every funeral.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.623
Dash of forgetting
would be nice.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.334
Nobody's gonna forget Jack.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.961
No way.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.673
The impact he's had here,
not gonna forget him.

09:08.756 --> 09:12.093
Impact he had on us, sure.

09:13.094 --> 09:16.264
You're saying that it...

09:16.347 --> 09:20.351
He hasn't, uh, created
any kind of change around here?

09:20.434 --> 09:23.020
For 18 years, he's been on
the right side of the, the war.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.981
I mean, you can't just
erase that.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.440
I think if, uh,

09:26.524 --> 09:28.359
war and scripture
have taught me one thing,

09:28.442 --> 09:29.819
it's that nothing is permanent,

09:29.902 --> 09:33.531
that the only constant
is change.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.118
Uh...

09:39.078 --> 09:41.014
Yeah, I don't buy that.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.873
Some things,
they live on forever.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.418
Yeah, well, let's hope so.

09:45.501 --> 09:46.625
See you around, Jason.

09:46.649 --> 09:47.795
Yeah.

10:00.599 --> 10:02.518
What the hell you doing?

10:02.601 --> 10:06.188
Well, most of your, uh,

10:06.272 --> 10:08.190
your fences are rotten and...

10:08.274 --> 10:11.152
the livestock's only sticking
around out of kindness.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.468
After that supper
the other night,

10:18.492 --> 10:20.995
I didn't expect
to see you again.

10:22.621 --> 10:25.666
I owe you for parts
and maintenance on the car.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.044
That's okay. I...

10:28.127 --> 10:29.545
It was just something to do.

10:29.628 --> 10:33.215
Yeah. I know the drill on that.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.384
If you want some help,
you just have to ask.

10:35.468 --> 10:39.513
Well, I remember you more
of a hands-off type of guy.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.275
No truce would satisfy you.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.736
"Striking a deal
with the Great Satan America

10:53.819 --> 10:56.364
would make us less
than groveling pigs."

10:56.447 --> 10:58.574
Those are your words, Akhtar.

10:58.657 --> 11:00.534
And yet, you were granted

11:00.618 --> 11:02.745
a seat at the table
for the peace talks.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.623
That was generous
of your Taliban brothers.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.250
I have always made
my beliefs clear.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.086
Mm-hmm.

11:10.169 --> 11:13.255
You made them very clear by
cutting off the hands of those

11:13.339 --> 11:16.175
who dared sign in peace
with the Americans.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.719
I was not at that meeting.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.305
Right.

11:21.389 --> 11:25.768
Just your luck that you were
the only one who didn't show up.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.270
Everyone else
ends up slaughtered,

11:28.354 --> 11:30.272
and you go underground.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.941
You didn't do it alone.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.442
You're gonna start
listing names.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.778
Otherwise, you are no use to us,

11:35.861 --> 11:38.280
and we hand you back to the very
same Taliban brothers

11:38.364 --> 11:40.950
that tried to put bullets in you
a few hours ago.

11:41.033 --> 11:44.870
I can't imagine they'll
be so gentle this time.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.625
Last chance.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.669
You talk or they take you.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.173
I was not

11:56.257 --> 11:58.968
at that meeting
because I was warned.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.595
You were warned.

12:01.679 --> 12:06.350
I cautioned the others,
then I took shelter.

12:06.434 --> 12:10.354
Okay. Who warned you?

12:10.438 --> 12:12.565
My nephew Murad.

12:12.648 --> 12:16.402
He is a young man here
in Jalalabad.

12:16.485 --> 12:20.865
The group he's a part of,
they call themselves Tahara.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.533
Who are they?

12:22.616 --> 12:27.037
The network you will spend
the next 20 years hunting.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.874
And Tahara, this group
is responsible for...

12:29.957 --> 12:33.335
The KLE killings,
the other attacks.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.045
All of it.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.007
And they're only beginning.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.390
It could all be a bluff.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.059
Zahed's caught, he's flailing,
blaming his crimes on some group

12:49.143 --> 12:53.230
he claims he knows just enough
about to make them seem scary.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.916
- It's not a bluff.
- This network connects

12:54.940 --> 12:56.901
a lot of the dots
I've been plotting.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.944
I've only had one round
with Zahed.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.906
Want to go down
rabbit holes already?

13:05.451 --> 13:07.036
Samim.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.329
Miss Mandy, what are you

13:08.412 --> 13:09.872
and your friend in the mood for?

13:09.955 --> 13:11.081
Lamb, chicken?

13:11.165 --> 13:13.209
How about rabbit?

13:14.919 --> 13:16.981
- Murad?
- We need to find him.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.840
File says he works
for you, Samim.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.013
I worried about Murad.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.390
He has a spark of
his uncle's fury,

13:28.474 --> 13:31.227
but I hoped he'd direct
it in a different way.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.395
He and two
of the other young men

13:33.479 --> 13:36.065
stopped showing up for work
a few weeks ago.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.335
Where'd they go?

13:37.359 --> 13:38.567
I don't know.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.070
But they've been spending time
at a hookah lounge.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.072
Word was,

13:43.155 --> 13:44.907
there were meetings
going on there.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.886
- A radicalization center?
- Rumors.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.869
I don't know for certain.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.288
You hear any mention of Tahara?

13:51.372 --> 13:52.915
The wind carries new threats

13:52.998 --> 13:53.998
every day.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.251
It's hard to tell what's real.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.921
It's real. And you
need to help us.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.423
Talk to your employees,
their friends.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.984
About Murad,
about what might be happening

14:03.008 --> 14:04.278
- at the hookah lounge.
- No.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.596
I can't do that. I'm sorry.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.267
I know cooperating with us
can feel dangerous.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.702
I've told you all I know.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.478
If I'm going around,
asking questions...

14:14.562 --> 14:17.940
Then you are just a concerned
boss looking out for his guys.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.358
Trust us.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.902
There's nothing to be afraid of.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.240
You think that's true?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.451
Nothing to be afraid of.

14:32.871 --> 14:35.332
Yo.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.460
Now, I know Jameelah's doll
was in my hooch.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.671
Which one of y'all
has seen it? What's up?

14:40.754 --> 14:42.506
You know, I think, uh,

14:42.590 --> 14:45.634
the deployment's starting
to get to little Teena.

14:57.605 --> 14:58.897
That's all him, man.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.324
You don't ever touch anything of
mine again. You understand me?

15:08.407 --> 15:10.010
- That's a...
- I said, "Do you understand me?

15:10.034 --> 15:11.261
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Don't touch it.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.870
That's the Ray Perry I know.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.347
Hey. What the
hell's going on?

15:14.371 --> 15:16.624
Come on. Cool off.
You all right?

15:16.707 --> 15:19.001
Yeah. After all these years,

15:19.084 --> 15:20.669
Thirty still does not know
when to quit.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.379
All right. Slow it down,
all right?

15:22.463 --> 15:24.381
Hey. Breathe, man.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.842
Come on. You two were
boys back in the day.

15:26.925 --> 15:29.822
- Yeah, those days I don't care to go back to.
- Look, I understand.

15:29.928 --> 15:31.740
It's not good for any of us
just to be sitting around.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.907
We're a lot better
when we're operating.

15:32.931 --> 15:34.850
Yeah, that's for damn sure.

15:34.933 --> 15:37.053
Rolling up Zahed yesterday
was the first time all trip

15:37.102 --> 15:39.855
we did anything felt like it
justified us being here.

15:39.938 --> 15:42.191
Turns out he's not the guy.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.193
Intel's suggesting

15:44.276 --> 15:46.076
that there's another group
behind the attacks.

15:46.111 --> 15:49.531
So, the one victory we have,
it turns out it's-it's nothing.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.677
- A mistake?
- It was a mission that we crushed.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.802
Yeah, but now we're back
to square zero.

15:52.826 --> 15:53.845
- We don't have no idea what we're doing here.
- Hey.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.515
We have lost our grip, J.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.206
Speak for yourself, Ray.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.708
Oh, right.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.512
Whole new batch of enemies
has you thrilled.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.104
Squeeze another 20 years
out of fighting them,

16:03.128 --> 16:04.505
no matter what the cost.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.174
Hey, go cool off. Take a walk.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.180
Sorry, brother.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.229
Hate to say it, Linus,

16:20.312 --> 16:24.024
but I don't think
the Great Pumpkin's gonna show.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.195
You ever go bass fishing, Kopel?

16:28.278 --> 16:31.907
Same rule. Taliban don't come
when you're talking.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.786
All right,
how we looking, spotter?

16:35.869 --> 16:37.871
Uh, tree at about
a hundred yards.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.916
Looks like wind's picking up,
blowing east to west.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.544
Okay. At a thousand?

16:43.627 --> 16:45.546
Dying down a bit.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.923
Blowing opposite out there,
west to east.

16:48.006 --> 16:49.925
Crosswind.

16:50.008 --> 16:52.094
You let me know if it
changes direction, okay?

16:52.177 --> 16:53.595
Copy that.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.891
You fish back home?

16:57.975 --> 16:59.727
Yeah, a little bit. You?

16:59.810 --> 17:00.936
Yeah.

17:01.019 --> 17:03.272
Yeah, I live for it.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.107
Pike, walleye.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.276
You name it, I'm catching it.

17:07.358 --> 17:10.112
Good old Lake Delton, Wisconsin.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.281
Uh, these days, though,
I feel more like the bait

17:12.364 --> 17:14.116
than the fisherman,
if you know what I mean.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.869
Just thrown to this outpost
to chum up these waters.

17:20.329 --> 17:25.252
You stick your platoon in
a ditch on a mountain, man,

17:25.335 --> 17:27.337
can't see how that wins a war.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.133
What, so they don't
give you all the answers

17:31.216 --> 17:34.928
when they put that cool patch
on your arm?

17:35.012 --> 17:36.138
Not quite.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.140
It's close to sundown.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.534
We'll probably hear
one of these clowns

17:39.558 --> 17:40.476
fire off from
somewhere pretty soon.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.311
Kopel, shut up.
Look, look, look.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.114
Mortar tube.
They're gonna light up the COP.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.816
All right. Mounds,

17:47.900 --> 17:50.652
if I miss, I may need you
to spot the impact

17:50.736 --> 17:52.321
and help me correct, all right?

17:52.404 --> 17:53.947
Got it.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.657
All right.

17:55.741 --> 17:59.411
I'm gonna start cutting them
from right to left, in order.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.040
Spotter ready?

18:03.123 --> 18:04.583
Spotter ready.

18:19.848 --> 18:23.727
Think your LT's gonna let us
do that recon hike now?

18:23.811 --> 18:26.332
<i>People can say whatever they want.</i>

18:26.438 --> 18:28.982
They can drag their feet,
they can doubt you.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.360
But you can ignore
the crap out of them,

18:31.443 --> 18:33.862
'cause you were right
since you got here.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.256
You know, you're
a far better cheerleader

18:35.280 --> 18:36.406
than you are a runner.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.759
You know that, right?

18:37.783 --> 18:40.410
Painfully aware.
Especially my calves.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.680
Hey, you want to get something to eat later?

18:42.704 --> 18:44.016
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

18:44.122 --> 18:46.166
All right.

18:48.126 --> 18:49.044
Hey.

18:49.127 --> 18:50.689
- Hey. Seen...
- What up?

18:50.796 --> 18:53.215
Seen you two together
on base a few times now.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.217
Yeah.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.906
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Reiss is a, he's a sharp interrogator, you know?

18:59.012 --> 19:01.014
So, it's good to pick his brain.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.599
Yeah, ups and downs we've had,

19:02.683 --> 19:04.483
it's good to have someone
to ride with, right?

19:05.644 --> 19:07.604
What do you mean, ups and downs?

19:07.688 --> 19:09.565
Well, I just heard
our big bad HVT

19:09.648 --> 19:11.191
isn't looking so big or bad now.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.027
That type of disappointment
warrants a distraction.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.364
No, I'm not disappointed.
And Zahed was our distraction.

19:17.447 --> 19:18.782
No, now I'm-I'm driving towards

19:18.866 --> 19:20.617
what's really going on
around here.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.370
All right, then.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.747
It's just nice to see you have
some balance is all.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.751
If I'm being honest,
he doesn't seem like your type.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.921
If I'm being honest, it's
really none of your business.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.591
And-and you know what?
What is my type?

19:35.674 --> 19:38.302
Somebody that need somebody
to take care of them?

19:38.385 --> 19:40.762
You know, prop them up, instead
of standing on their own?

19:40.846 --> 19:42.264
I-I didn't say that.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.325
- Davis, is everything all right?
- You know, I'm locked in,

19:44.349 --> 19:46.101
I'm doing the work,
I'm getting results.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.312
I really don't need anybody
worried about my balance.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.647
Copy that.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.818
You know, nobody ever questions
when you guys are all in.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.280
Now it's my turn.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.409
Back in senior year,

20:02.492 --> 20:04.411
we were... What was
that guy, Pudge?

20:04.494 --> 20:05.614
- Pudge, uh...
- Oh, McHenry.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.391
- McHenry. You remember that?
- Mm-hmm.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.583
You... He did that Jaeger shot.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.919
It came back up, it was...
I mean, guy was a disaster.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.314
There was more carnage than
I've ever seen on a battlefield.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.883
And I believe you mean
State Senator Pudge McHenry.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.301
No way.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.821
- Swear it. Mm-hmm.
- You serious?

20:20.928 --> 20:23.115
- Wow.
- Is that so hard to believe in a world

20:23.221 --> 20:25.221
Where you just spent all day
working with your dad?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.310
Okay, you got me.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.480
What'd you two talk about?

20:31.563 --> 20:32.981
Uh...

20:34.232 --> 20:36.693
Wood and barbed wire.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.695
It was very, very,
very Hallmark.

20:38.779 --> 20:39.988
Yeah.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.657
Well, I think that's a start.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.824
Yeah, we'll see.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.493
You know, when he comes in here

20:44.576 --> 20:46.828
from time to time,
I get the sense

20:46.912 --> 20:49.164
he's fishing for information
about you.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.375
I haven't had the heart

20:51.458 --> 20:52.602
to tell him I've been
in the dark

20:52.626 --> 20:54.336
all these years same as him.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.671
Hmm.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.339
That vanishing act

20:57.422 --> 21:00.425
you pulled,
you ever gonna tell me why?

21:01.927 --> 21:06.682
Well, you know,
you went off to UT and...

21:06.765 --> 21:08.327
- Hmm.
- I guess I was just reminded

21:08.433 --> 21:10.852
Every single day of what I...

21:10.936 --> 21:13.522
ooh, what I didn't have anymore.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.691
I decided then that

21:15.774 --> 21:20.195
no one could leave me...

21:20.278 --> 21:23.198
if I left first.

21:23.281 --> 21:25.742
So I-I just went
to the recruiting office

21:25.826 --> 21:28.704
and I signed up.
"Hey, man, put me on a boat."

21:28.787 --> 21:30.706
Why didn't you tell me?

21:30.789 --> 21:32.708
I didn't want you talking
me out of it. Come on.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.876
Hey, look, it's the Navy.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.379
You know how terrified I am
of water.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.717
Well, you still should
have said goodbye to me.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.387
Yeah.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.811
There's a lot of things I should
have said to you back then.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.232
You want to go for a drive?

22:05.157 --> 22:06.468
- Whoa. Hey.
- Hey.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.095
- What's up?
- Well, we need to talk.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.703
What about?

22:09.786 --> 22:12.164
About the Ambassador Marsden
letter situation.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.542
Look, the, uh, truth came out.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.461
There's nothing to
talk about. It's over.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.440
- It's done.
- Yeah, it's far from over.

22:19.546 --> 22:20.589
What do you mean?

22:20.672 --> 22:21.816
State investigated their people

22:21.840 --> 22:23.008
at the Yemen compound.

22:23.091 --> 22:25.761
They've concluded that someone
from Bravo wrote the letter.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.305
You're kidding me.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.768
The brass has been, you know,

22:32.851 --> 22:35.062
coming to a lot
of conclusions lately

22:35.145 --> 22:38.482
that, if you ask me...
they've been off.

22:38.565 --> 22:40.942
Yeah, well,
this is serious, Jason.

22:41.026 --> 22:44.488
A Tier One operator
breaking classification

22:44.571 --> 22:47.926
- to accuse the State Department of a cover-up?
- Yeah.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.343
State Department could
kneecap this team

22:49.367 --> 22:50.410
in a dozen different ways.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.120
Right.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.414
Remember when this war
was just about fighting?

22:56.166 --> 22:58.627
Yeah. Well, I just wanted
to keep you in the loop...

22:58.710 --> 23:00.128
Thanks.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.856
So you won't be surprised
when this thing comes

23:01.880 --> 23:03.924
crashing down on us.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.229
I'll be back.

23:27.739 --> 23:30.033
There will be a meeting
tomorrow morning.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.827
That hookah lounge
we talked about.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.161
All I know.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.722
Okay, we'll need somebody
at that meeting.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.498
Eyes and ears inside
to help us ID

23:36.581 --> 23:38.166
the members of this network.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.836
Your pushy boss might
have some ideas.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.504
I need to get back to work.

23:42.587 --> 23:45.507
You're a known and trusted
member of this community.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.551
It's perfectly plausible
Tahara's rhetoric

23:47.634 --> 23:49.905
- might have struck a chord with you.
- Stop!

23:50.011 --> 23:51.740
You're gonna help
make this place safer.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.515
Yes.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.184
Tell my wife and son
I put myself into a room

23:56.268 --> 23:58.353
of murderers in the interest
of safety.

23:58.436 --> 23:59.855
I did what you asked for.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.440
Please, leave me alone.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.362
Your on-base vendor contracts
are up next month.

24:07.445 --> 24:08.864
I'd hate to tell
your wife and son

24:08.947 --> 24:10.740
that you lost your business.

24:10.824 --> 24:13.869
You are not serious.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.913
We all have choices to make.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.485
So everything's good, right?

24:28.509 --> 24:29.759
Mm.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.554
I mean, look,
you got your asset.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.347
You got eyes inside
of that meeting.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.391
We're good.

24:36.474 --> 24:39.394
Yeah, extortion's
good like that.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.397
How you're feeling right now,

24:42.480 --> 24:43.833
does that have anything
to do with Davis?

24:43.857 --> 24:45.525
She, uh, force your hand at all?

24:45.609 --> 24:46.879
- No, no. No.
- No?

24:46.985 --> 24:48.069
My call.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.447
Nothing I haven't done before.

24:50.530 --> 24:53.241
Just seems like she's
been, uh, pushing it hard,

24:53.325 --> 24:54.635
almost like she's on
some kind of warpath.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.995
Well, we are at war.

24:58.705 --> 25:02.876
If she's got a path to follow...

25:02.959 --> 25:04.336
it's better than what I got.

25:07.088 --> 25:10.592
She's staking her ground,
embracing her job

25:10.675 --> 25:13.303
while I'm just trying
to remember how to do mine.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.100
Coercing sources,
developing assets.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.103
I used to enjoy that.
Whatever it took.

25:22.187 --> 25:25.106
Right. Until Caracas.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.317
Dr. Craig.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.947
You see him in this guy?

25:32.030 --> 25:35.784
I hear him.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.619
The tremor in his voice
when he asks

25:37.702 --> 25:39.287
if I can protect him.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.122
The lie in mine when I answer.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.666
Well, you can't...

25:42.749 --> 25:44.435
We can't lose sight
of what we're doing here.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.688
I know, but...

25:45.712 --> 25:46.962
Opportunity to take out

25:47.045 --> 25:49.839
a major network
before it spreads.

25:49.923 --> 25:52.467
Nothing's gonna come for free,
that's for sure.

25:55.553 --> 25:58.473
Tali village should be
two more klicks.

25:58.556 --> 26:00.308
You guys holding up all right?

26:00.392 --> 26:01.702
Imprisoned in an outpost
for ten months?

26:01.726 --> 26:04.145
They're happy
to stretch their legs.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.147
Amazes me you guys can
keep morale up

26:06.231 --> 26:07.649
living in that bullet sponge.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.150
Take it a day at a time.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.361
Getting mortared
keeps things lively.

26:11.444 --> 26:14.823
You guys are better
than your command deserves.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.491
Doesn't make any sense, man.

26:16.574 --> 26:19.160
Strand the platoon
on a desert island like this.

26:19.244 --> 26:22.831
Obsolete tactics against
an evolving enemy.

26:22.914 --> 26:25.000
Someone has
to maintain presence,

26:25.083 --> 26:27.877
but I don't disagree.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.171
Glad you're being
fast-tracked for brass,

26:30.255 --> 26:31.506
this program you mentioned.

26:31.589 --> 26:33.341
I imagine a West Point
ring-knocker like you

26:33.425 --> 26:34.986
is eager to start calling
bigger shots as well.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.678
Not in any rush.

26:36.761 --> 26:40.557
Way I look at it, every day
out here is an education.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.518
Something new about leadership,

26:43.601 --> 26:47.397
combat, what makes
a war fighter.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.774
There's still a lot
for me to learn.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.865
They got an armored technical.

26:56.948 --> 26:59.034
Some serious weaponry.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.839
They look like
foreign fighters, too.

27:12.922 --> 27:14.382
Out here?

27:14.466 --> 27:15.675
Why would they be out here?

27:17.135 --> 27:19.055
- Where's it coming from?
- Mounds, down!

27:20.764 --> 27:22.491
Whoever it is down there,
they got a lookout up here.

27:22.515 --> 27:24.684
Village is waking up,
vehicles are moving.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.895
We need to fall back
to the outpost.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.480
Fall back to the COP.

27:28.563 --> 27:29.856
Fall back to the COP.

27:29.939 --> 27:31.066
Alpha 2, this is Alpha 1.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.568
We have troops in contact.
Do you copy?

27:33.651 --> 27:34.795
Copy, Alpha 1.

27:34.819 --> 27:35.819
- Spenser.
- Yeah?

27:35.862 --> 27:37.822
Let's move.

27:43.119 --> 27:45.038
Samim, we need a comms check.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.307
Touch your wrist
if you can hear me.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.624
Copy.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.085
All right, we need you
to work the room,

27:50.168 --> 27:54.005
get us clear visual on as many
of the men as possible.

28:01.137 --> 28:04.766
The facial recognition won't
work unless he's closer.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.644
Uh, Samim, can you get in
closer with the group?

28:07.727 --> 28:09.646
We need clear looks.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.612
Anyone familiar?

28:17.695 --> 28:19.489
No hits on the database.

28:26.871 --> 28:29.457
Ray, what's he saying?

28:29.541 --> 28:31.751
"The old guard has betrayed us,

28:31.835 --> 28:35.630
"degraded us by seeking peace
with our tormentors."

28:35.713 --> 28:38.235
- Yeah?
- "Tahara will drain the blood from the throats

28:38.341 --> 28:40.969
Of these fakes... "Uh, "frauds."

28:42.887 --> 28:44.514
All right.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.442
You're okay, Samim.
I got you.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.653
He's beating the same drum.

28:58.736 --> 29:01.698
"Tahara will wipe
the land clear,

29:01.781 --> 29:04.826
"wash it with fury
so a new age can begin.

29:04.909 --> 29:08.204
"Joining us in words
is not enough.

29:08.288 --> 29:11.958
True devotion comes
with action."

29:15.086 --> 29:16.504
What have they got there?

29:16.588 --> 29:19.174
Samim, can you show us
what's in the crates?

29:34.230 --> 29:35.670
Looks like they're gearing up.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.067
Getting ready to hit
their next target.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.195
Let's go.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.137
Three! Three!

29:47.161 --> 29:46.093
Go, go, go!

29:46.117 --> 29:48.203
Go, go!

29:48.286 --> 29:50.205
Set security posts
on the perimeter.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.832
We're already there.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.210
We're taking small-arms fire
from ten to 12 enemy

29:55.293 --> 29:56.878
on the south and east walls.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.505
These are Tali from the village?

29:58.588 --> 30:00.548
We've got no idea who they are.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.235
Get down!

30:05.053 --> 30:06.721
Hey! Vehicle-mounted heavy gun.

30:06.804 --> 30:09.390
Where we at with air support?

30:09.474 --> 30:10.993
Fastest they can
get out here is an hour.

30:11.017 --> 30:13.228
We're on our own till then.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.706
Mandy sent me. You understand?

30:33.790 --> 30:36.292
It'll be okay if you play
the part. Come on. Play.

30:38.461 --> 30:40.380
Quick on the exits!

30:40.463 --> 30:41.339
Quick on the SSE and move out.
Move!

30:41.422 --> 30:44.259
Thirty, grab
those cell phones, laptops.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.927
Let's go.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.973
Right here! Right here!

30:51.182 --> 30:52.869
- Let's check out the west wall.
- Hey!

30:52.976 --> 30:55.371
That technical's not gonna stop
till it chews through that wall.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.105
We're doing everything we can.

30:57.188 --> 31:00.441
I can get an angle on the same
high-ground spot I used earlier.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.236
You'll get devoured
before you're halfway up.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.070
All right, then draw some fire

31:04.153 --> 31:05.738
and buy me a minute
to make the run.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.783
We need everyone inside
the wires. It's not Rambo time.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.846
Look, we've got 45 minutes
till that air support gets here.

31:12.870 --> 31:15.456
Okay? We're not gonna be
able to hold that long.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.792
Give me a gun team and a 240
and I'll make it work.

31:17.875 --> 31:20.628
Kopel! Mounds!

31:20.712 --> 31:23.464
Hey, I'm telling you, trust me.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.133
All right. Go with Spenser.

31:25.216 --> 31:27.302
Get a 240, okay?
You stay low.

31:27.385 --> 31:28.261
Yes, sir.

31:28.344 --> 31:30.972
Spenser, they're not
doorkickers, they're kids.

31:31.055 --> 31:32.659
- All right?
- Understood.

31:39.230 --> 31:42.442
I told them to hold Samim for
two hours, then cut him loose.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.488
Look, you know what?
He did good, all right?

31:47.572 --> 31:51.659
Probably gonna need
a new lunch spot, though.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.494
Sacrifices we make.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.331
Thanks for looking out for him.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.625
You bet.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.423
Yo.

32:07.447 --> 32:08.885
Hey.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.638
Laptops and cell phones.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.308
Consider it an olive branch
for yesterday.

32:15.391 --> 32:17.143
Well, you know what
peace offerings

32:17.226 --> 32:18.645
lead to around here, right?

32:20.563 --> 32:22.815
Look, I'm really glad
you're all in.

32:22.899 --> 32:26.194
I am. The big picture
around here

32:26.277 --> 32:27.570
is a little fuzzy for me.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.405
Who we're fighting and why.

32:29.489 --> 32:32.492
I'd love for you to clarify it,
Ms. Davis.

32:33.451 --> 32:35.078
I'm on it.

33:03.523 --> 33:04.774
Spenser, Mounds is down!

33:04.857 --> 33:06.734
I need help here!

33:06.818 --> 33:08.695
Come on, buddy.

33:11.364 --> 33:12.364
Oh, it hurts.

33:14.867 --> 33:17.870
I can't make it stop.

33:26.212 --> 33:27.857
- I need a medic!
- Medic's on the way.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.048
We got you, Mounds.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.633
Let's get him on this table.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.260
All right. Here we go.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.386
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

33:33.469 --> 33:34.762
Come on.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.556
Easy, easy, easy.
You're all right.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.933
Get him up. Come on. Get
him up. Come on. Get him up.

33:39.016 --> 33:40.184
Nice and easy.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.187
Hey, Private, you with me? Hey.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.897
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.608
Uh, he took those guys out.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.819
Two shots, bang, bang.
That was crazy.

33:49.902 --> 33:50.945
Did you see that?

33:51.028 --> 33:52.405
How bad is it?

33:52.488 --> 33:54.615
Well, round missed the artery.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.618
He gonna be all right?

33:57.702 --> 33:59.162
Looks like a scar and a story.

34:00.580 --> 34:02.266
All right. Okay, let's get back
to the perimeter,

34:02.290 --> 34:03.475
make sure there's
not a second wave.

34:03.499 --> 34:04.667
All right.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.384
Hey.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.094
Should've given you
more than this.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.311
Tell me about Tahara.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.984
We know that you're
the group behind

34:30.067 --> 34:32.195
the peace talk assassinations.

34:32.277 --> 34:35.572
Who was your next target
going to be?

34:35.656 --> 34:37.364
Tell me about Tahara.

34:39.202 --> 34:42.496
The key leader engagement
attack, the hands.

34:42.580 --> 34:43.998
Who was behind that?

34:44.081 --> 34:45.081
Who took part in that?

34:45.123 --> 34:46.667
Tell us about Tahara.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.378
Who gives Tahara its orders?

34:51.130 --> 34:52.340
Who is giving Tahara

34:52.422 --> 34:53.882
its orders?

34:53.966 --> 34:55.384
<i>You're not going anywhere</i>

34:55.467 --> 34:57.470
until you tell me something.

34:57.553 --> 34:59.555
Who was your next
target going to be?

34:59.639 --> 35:01.849
The KLE killings.
Were you there?

35:01.933 --> 35:04.519
The KLE killings.
Were you there?

35:04.602 --> 35:06.437
<i>I've been at this for six hours.</i>

35:06.521 --> 35:07.855
For 12 hours.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.398
I've been here for 18 hours.

35:09.482 --> 35:10.858
And I've got no problem

35:10.942 --> 35:12.777
doing 18 more.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.655
You get anything
from the detainees?

35:15.738 --> 35:17.990
Every one of them was
clueless or stonewalling.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.368
Hey, hey. Step away
from the tomato plants.

35:20.451 --> 35:21.888
- Just keep it moving.
- All right.

35:21.994 --> 35:23.871
You checked with
all the databases?

35:23.955 --> 35:26.332
DIA's doing it, too,
but it takes time.

35:26.415 --> 35:28.876
Longer than we can hold them
with our reduced resources.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.646
You got to be kidding me.
Look at this place.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.981
Everybody's packing up and
this country's about to explode.

35:33.005 --> 35:35.526
Mm. We held onto the more senior
detainees, anyone with a record,

35:35.550 --> 35:37.510
but we kicked the recruits free.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.762
Kicked them free. All right.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.229
You got to be kidding me.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.689
You cracked all this open

35:49.772 --> 35:50.690
from those laptops
and those cell phones?

35:50.773 --> 35:52.191
Apparently, encryption

35:52.275 --> 35:53.836
is the one weakness
in their organization,

35:53.860 --> 35:55.420
because everything else
is beyond what we imagined.

35:55.444 --> 35:57.196
This is a movement of operatives

35:57.280 --> 35:59.198
from at least a dozen nations,

35:59.282 --> 36:01.117
drawing from a seemingly
bottomless war chest

36:01.200 --> 36:04.412
of money and arms.

36:04.495 --> 36:07.248
We don't know anything
about these people.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.475
Anything, till three days ago.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.001
How does... How is that possible?

36:10.084 --> 36:11.836
- Working theory?
- Tahara was formed

36:11.919 --> 36:13.754
around a singular
"black swan" leader.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.132
Someone with enough money
and influence to pull

36:16.215 --> 36:19.594
all these elements together with
unprecedented speed and force.

36:19.677 --> 36:20.780
The question is who.

36:20.804 --> 36:21.929
Doesn't matter who.

36:22.013 --> 36:26.267
They'll take their shot...
we'll take them out.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.768
Won't be easy.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.145
Why is that?

36:29.228 --> 36:30.938
The last time the region
saw a group rise

36:31.022 --> 36:32.648
with this sudden ferocity?

36:32.732 --> 36:34.108
Go back to al-Qaeda.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.777
Before any of us were here.

36:38.070 --> 36:40.281
You got to let some of it go.

36:44.785 --> 36:46.120
You can't afford to keep

36:46.203 --> 36:47.955
this property up.

36:48.039 --> 36:51.959
The tax bill,
the hired help you need.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.629
All right, you want
to make some suggestions

36:54.712 --> 36:59.175
to, uh, which acreage
I should sell first?

36:59.258 --> 37:03.596
The hill where my folks
and your mom are buried?

37:03.679 --> 37:06.015
Or these pastures, which have
supported this family

37:06.098 --> 37:08.017
for the last 90 years?

37:08.100 --> 37:12.855
Now, even though you left,
I had really hoped

37:12.939 --> 37:15.691
that you'd remember
that you are connected here.

37:15.775 --> 37:19.487
I do remember how good
things were once.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.113
You, me, Mama.

37:21.197 --> 37:24.617
But you need to accept
the fact that you cannot

37:24.700 --> 37:26.994
manage this property all alone.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.538
Alone was never the plan.

37:29.622 --> 37:33.125
I was just dealt that hand.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.753
This ranch is the Quinn legacy.

37:35.836 --> 37:37.380
And I'm gonna sort it out.

37:37.463 --> 37:39.298
Sort what out? Emmet,

37:39.382 --> 37:43.886
if you don't let some of this
go, you will lose it all.

37:46.055 --> 37:48.015
I'm gonna go wash up,
put some steaks on.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.225
And you're more than welcome

37:49.308 --> 37:52.103
to join me for dinner.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.540
Well, hey, there.

38:12.623 --> 38:14.709
Hey.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.377
I just wanted to swing by

38:16.460 --> 38:18.546
before you head back
to base for the week.

38:18.629 --> 38:23.884
You know, uh, I'm gonna go
back and forth from here.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.886
Crash in my old room.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.073
Really?

38:27.097 --> 38:28.222
Yeah.

38:28.306 --> 38:32.601
Just got this, uh, this feeling
I should stay here for a while.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.110
Spenser.

38:41.193 --> 38:42.528
Good work, man.

38:42.611 --> 38:45.531
We'll be back
in J-Bad by dinner.

38:45.614 --> 38:49.410
Yeah. Doesn't feel right leaving
you guys out here like this.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.579
As far as the enemy knows,
the death dealer

38:51.662 --> 38:53.706
who sniped their guys
is still here.

38:53.789 --> 38:55.750
Make them think twice
about causing trouble.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.585
Whoever they are.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.420
I'll have JSOC dig
into that question.

38:59.503 --> 39:02.381
It's the least I can do after
I poked the hornets' nest.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.592
Not on you.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.594
You had orders to check it out.

39:06.677 --> 39:09.180
What happened to Mounds,
that's on me.

39:09.263 --> 39:12.767
Like I said, school's in session
every day out here.

39:12.850 --> 39:13.976
All got things to learn.

39:14.060 --> 39:16.103
Take care, Spenser.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.397
All right.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.807
Looking for something?

39:52.890 --> 39:54.975
Yeah, a, uh,
the interpreters' quarters.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.435
My-my friend, he...

39:56.519 --> 39:58.187
uh, lived here.

39:58.270 --> 40:00.523
I-I left something for him here.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.191
Base drawdown.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.819
Cleared out these
structures this afternoon.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.946
Everything must go.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.791
You know what I'm saying...

40:18.874 --> 40:20.376
Uh-oh!

40:22.545 --> 40:24.547
Spenser, what's up, man?

40:24.630 --> 40:26.632
Man, it's good to see you. Hey.

40:26.715 --> 40:28.693
Grab a drink, tell us tales
of the hinterland, brother.

40:28.717 --> 40:30.136
What up, little buddy?

40:30.219 --> 40:31.948
- Exactly.
- Okay.

40:32.054 --> 40:33.157
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.700
- How you doing?
- What's going on?

40:35.934 --> 40:37.059
Hey, what's up, man? Reiss.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.310
Uh, Davis's friend.

40:38.394 --> 40:40.896
Gotcha. Cheers.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.000
Yo, buddy.

40:42.024 --> 40:43.065
Hey.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.192
Oh, man.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.161
How'd it go out there?

40:57.121 --> 41:01.333
You know, we, uh,
took a little fire.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.043
Got a little rough for a minute.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.045
I didn't know that.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.423
No. All good.

41:08.465 --> 41:10.759
Look, you know...

41:10.843 --> 41:12.553
the way I sent you off, uh,

41:12.636 --> 41:14.054
maybe that wasn't
the best way to...

41:14.138 --> 41:15.598
No, it was exactly
what I needed.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.935
You know, the whole squad
on your back,

41:20.019 --> 41:22.354
living and dying
by your calls, I mean...

41:24.315 --> 41:26.108
I got a taste
of what that means.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.152
What it's like to lead.

41:28.235 --> 41:30.404
You know, what you
do every single day.

41:32.323 --> 41:35.951
But, you know, there's some...

41:36.035 --> 41:38.204
some things I need
to think about.

41:38.287 --> 41:39.997
Yeah?

41:41.999 --> 41:44.251
Yeah.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.713
Things I'll take
with me to STA-21.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.549
Jason.

41:50.633 --> 41:51.926
I got to show you something.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.594
Davis.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.934
Say that again?

42:00.017 --> 42:02.895
DIA got a hit on one
of our detainees.

42:02.978 --> 42:05.272
Grozny, January.

42:05.356 --> 42:09.610
Three Chechen extremists,
and this man.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.612
Here he is a month
ago in Beirut,

42:11.695 --> 42:13.948
talking to Hezbollah leaders.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.199
The guy's a player.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.078
Told us his name was Elham Wali.

42:19.161 --> 42:21.455
Tea shop clerk,
never been out of J-Bad.

42:21.538 --> 42:23.123
Meanwhile, he's been cavorting

42:23.207 --> 42:25.518
with some of the most powerful
terrorist groups on the planet?

42:25.542 --> 42:26.853
- Great, fine.
- Pull him from the cell,

42:26.877 --> 42:28.796
tighten the screws,
do what we do.

42:28.879 --> 42:30.233
- We can't.
- I'm sorry,

42:30.339 --> 42:31.465
What do you mean, we can't?

42:31.548 --> 42:33.133
He sold himself
as a clueless recruit.

42:33.217 --> 42:34.718
He got released.

42:37.221 --> 42:38.597
He got released.

42:38.681 --> 42:40.891
Drawdown means
we couldn't hold everybody.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.820
We may have just found
the head of the snake,

42:44.895 --> 42:46.438
and we just let him go?
