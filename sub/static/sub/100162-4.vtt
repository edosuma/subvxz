00:06.120 --> 00:08.960
[church bells ring]

00:36.040 --> 00:38.960
[speaks Greek]

00:52.440 --> 00:54.600
[man in Greek] It's over, Mother Superior.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.000
I brought the accounts so you can see.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.040
The money has run out.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.520
[in Greek] But we need medicine.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.160
We need beds.

01:04.240 --> 01:05.840
We need food.

01:07.320 --> 01:10.360
I can't turn people away.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.440
In the past, when funds have run low,

01:14.520 --> 01:17.160
you have managed
to make personal contributions.

01:18.520 --> 01:21.080
I have already sold everything.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.640
[man] Then we have no choice.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.360
The Order must close.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.280
[man in English] And three,

01:56.360 --> 01:57.360
two...

02:01.680 --> 02:04.920
[presenter] Tonight on Meet the Press,
we have a very special guest indeed.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.680
His Royal Highness Prince Philip,
the Duke of Edinburgh.

02:08.280 --> 02:13.960
Here in Washington as part of an 18-day
tour of Canada and the United States.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.360
-Welcome, sir.
-Thank you. Delighted to be here.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.320
Now, so many questions to ask,
so little time.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.880
But one thing we'd like
to clear up right away

02:23.240 --> 02:27.240
for all of us ignorant Americans
who just don't understand.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.680
How come you're not king?

02:28.760 --> 02:29.960
[chuckles]

02:30.040 --> 02:34.200
Because when a king of England marries,
his wife, whoever she is,

02:34.280 --> 02:36.400
automatically becomes queen, correct?

02:36.480 --> 02:37.720
Uh, yes, correct.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.080
So, when the Queen married you,
what happened?

02:41.760 --> 02:44.440
As a fellow male, I am aggrieved.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.600
Yes, and you're right to be.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.520
-Hmm.
-[Philip] No, it's monstrously unjust.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.960
And to continue this theme of injustice,

02:54.040 --> 02:58.040
a recent news dispatch from London
begins this way:

02:58.440 --> 03:01.920
"Queen Elizabeth has not had
a pay raise in over 15 years."

03:02.000 --> 03:02.880
True.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.720
[presenter] The article then goes on
about the significant challenge

03:06.800 --> 03:10.840
the royal family faces in surviving
on the existing allowance.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.880
Is this creating
an awkward situation, sir?

03:14.960 --> 03:18.160
[Philip] Very. We go into the red,
I think, next year.

03:18.560 --> 03:23.120
Which, uh, which is not bad housekeeping,
if you come to think of it.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.280
We've kept the whole thing going
on a budget,

03:26.360 --> 03:30.360
which was based on the costs of...
of over 15 years ago,

03:30.440 --> 03:32.560
when the Queen acceded to the throne.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.800
[presenter]
So, in order to afford everything...

03:36.880 --> 03:40.240
Well, very considerable corners
have had to be cut,

03:40.320 --> 03:42.640
and it is beginning to have its effect.

03:43.480 --> 03:47.240
Now, if nothing happens,
we shall either have to, um...

03:48.000 --> 03:49.080
I mean, I don't know.

03:49.160 --> 03:52.560
We, uh, we may have to move
into smaller premises, who knows?

03:54.400 --> 03:57.480
-Smaller palaces?
-[Philip] Something like that.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.760
We've already embarked
on a general belt-tightening

04:00.840 --> 04:02.600
which has not made life easy.

04:02.680 --> 04:06.000
I mean, for instance,
we had a... we had a small yacht,

04:06.080 --> 04:07.680
which we have had to sell.

04:07.760 --> 04:08.680
Really?

04:08.760 --> 04:11.320
[Philip] I shall probably have
to give up polo fairly soon

04:11.400 --> 04:12.720
and things like that.

04:13.840 --> 04:17.560
[presenter] Thank you.
We'll be back with Meet the Press...

04:17.640 --> 04:19.840
International call, please.
London, England.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.720
01946 0200.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.840
[phone line rings]

04:27.920 --> 04:30.400
-Hello, Ken here.
-Ken, it's John Armstrong.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.480
I'm in New York on the Muhammad Ali story,

04:32.560 --> 04:36.160
and I've just seen the Duke of Edinburgh
give an interview on television here.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.560
Give me 600 words and hold the front page.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.800
-It's yours.
-You won't regret it.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.240
[pen clicks]

06:01.600 --> 06:03.040
[soldier] Present arms!

06:14.840 --> 06:19.680
I had intended to start our agenda
with the situation in Eastern Nigeria,

06:19.760 --> 06:21.880
but given the article in today's Guardian

06:21.960 --> 06:24.120
about His Royal Highness
the Duke of Edinburgh--

06:24.200 --> 06:26.560
Yes, perhaps we ought to start with that.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.360
What was the reaction in Cabinet?

06:29.440 --> 06:31.000
[Wilson] Positive, on the whole.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.440
In view of the gloomy economic forecast,

06:33.520 --> 06:36.720
might I suggest that the government
follows the advice of John Armstrong,

06:36.800 --> 06:38.400
writing in today's Guardian,

06:38.480 --> 06:42.280
and sells off an outdated and
redundant piece of state infrastructure,

06:42.360 --> 06:43.440
the royal family.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.040
[chuckling]

06:45.880 --> 06:46.760
On the whole?

06:46.840 --> 06:49.440
Well, of course the usual suspects
were jumping up and down.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.280
Benn, Crossman, Castle.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.320
You'd expect that.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.200
Perhaps a whip-round,
"Buy the Prince a New Pony"?

06:56.680 --> 06:58.560
In the current economic climate,

06:58.640 --> 07:02.840
with honest working families up
and down the country fighting to survive,

07:02.920 --> 07:07.680
I find a plea of poverty
from a jumped-up freeloader like him

07:07.760 --> 07:10.600
not just inappropriate,
but downright offensive.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.640
[all] Hear, hear!

07:11.720 --> 07:15.960
I'm assuming you know what that family
costs the British taxpayer each year.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.040
Two and a half million.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.480
Now, when you compare that
to the average family--

07:21.560 --> 07:24.840
I do know that. £1,607.

07:24.920 --> 07:30.040
Per year. The royal family costs
more than four times that per day.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.720
-And now they're asking for more! More!
-Outrageous!

07:33.800 --> 07:35.880
Come on, Barbara,
it's not cheap playing polo.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.320
-[laughter]
-How dare they? When half...

07:38.400 --> 07:42.680
[Wilson] It was the reaction
from the rest of them that concerned me.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.200
The fence-sitters.

07:45.720 --> 07:46.720
Before the article,

07:46.800 --> 07:50.200
I would have said there were
six hardliners in Cabinet

07:50.280 --> 07:52.080
in favor of cutting the Civil List

07:52.160 --> 07:55.360
against 14 whom we might call moderates.

07:57.520 --> 08:01.120
Now, the figures are more like ten to ten.

08:02.200 --> 08:06.680
-That's a significant and worrying swing.
-And your own position?

08:08.000 --> 08:08.880
Mine, ma'am?

08:08.960 --> 08:10.680
Yes, Prime Minister, yours.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.600
You hold the casting vote.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.800
Well, I've always been
an ardent supporter of the monarchy,

08:18.320 --> 08:19.680
as the record shows.

08:20.920 --> 08:24.000
But when it comes to a plea of poverty

08:24.080 --> 08:26.920
from the husband
of the richest woman in the world

08:27.280 --> 08:31.640
and an appeal to the British taxpayer
for a pay rise at a time like this,

08:32.280 --> 08:34.240
even I find myself...

08:35.880 --> 08:37.120
conflicted.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.800
[Philip]
I mean, what does he want us to do?

08:39.880 --> 08:43.760
Live in a semi-detached?
Travel everywhere on the omnibus?

08:43.840 --> 08:45.680
Actually, he did mention travel.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.880
That the royal yacht is funded
by the Navy,

08:49.360 --> 08:51.480
our aeroplanes by the Air Force,

08:51.920 --> 08:54.320
and that Margaret's recent holiday
in America

08:54.400 --> 08:56.240
cost the Exchequer £30,000.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.320
For which, I am told,
she did two days' actual work.

08:59.400 --> 09:03.520
Margaret's holiday not only secured
a multi-million pound bailout,

09:03.600 --> 09:06.600
but she also got rave reviews
in every newspaper in the world,

09:07.040 --> 09:09.800
which is a darn sight more
than Mr. Wilson and his...

09:10.200 --> 09:13.840
economically incompetent socialist chums
have achieved.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.600
Leave it with me.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.920
What does that mean?

09:23.400 --> 09:26.000
It means this needs a response.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.040
A robust response.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.160
-Philip...
-You deserve to be paid properly.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.880
We deserve to be paid properly.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.000
Well, I'm not going to rest until we are.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.280
[Philip clears throat]

09:58.440 --> 10:00.920
[indistinct chatter]

10:10.640 --> 10:15.680
[Mother Superior in Greek]
It's a genuine Ceylon sapphire

10:16.200 --> 10:18.640
set in diamonds.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.080
[pawnbroker]
No genuine sapphire is that size.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.400
If even a fraction of that were real,
it would be--

10:23.480 --> 10:25.320
Test it.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.400
[exhales]

10:59.360 --> 11:03.240
When you come up with an honest price,

11:03.320 --> 11:05.960
I will consider selling it.

11:06.840 --> 11:12.440
You can find me at the
Christian Sisterhood of Martha and Mary.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.920
10 Pefkon Street, Neo Iraklio.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.360
[sirens wail]

11:21.080 --> 11:23.080
[dogs bark in the distance]

11:30.960 --> 11:32.360
[bell rings]

11:35.200 --> 11:36.520
Unbelievable!

11:36.600 --> 11:39.600
The jewelry gangs these days!

11:39.680 --> 11:40.920
The lengths they go to!

12:03.200 --> 12:05.200
-[pawnbroker] Did you arrest her?
-[policeman] Who?

12:05.280 --> 12:06.960
[pawnbroker] The fake nun.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.800
[policeman]
There's nothing fake about her, you idiot.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.880
She's a real nun. And a real princess.

12:13.080 --> 12:13.960
What?

12:14.040 --> 12:18.440
Princess Alice of Greece and Denmark
was born in Windsor Castle.

12:18.920 --> 12:23.880
Her great-uncle was the Tsar of Russia,
her great-grandmother was Queen Victoria,

12:23.960 --> 12:27.520
and her son is married
to the Queen of England.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.560
[indistinct chatter]

12:36.120 --> 12:41.680
Did you come up with a price yet, sweetie?

12:46.520 --> 12:48.800
[Philip] Uh, sweetie, are you there?

12:51.440 --> 12:52.400
Can you hear me?

12:53.480 --> 12:54.880
[switch clicks]

12:56.200 --> 12:57.200
Sweetie?

12:59.200 --> 13:00.200
Sweetie?

13:04.360 --> 13:06.280
-Hello, sweetie?
-[microphone feedback]

13:09.040 --> 13:10.440
[footman] Your Royal Highness.

13:12.600 --> 13:16.400
Hello, sweetie? Can you hear me?
Do pick up.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.440
Hello?

13:24.080 --> 13:27.080
-Your Royal Highness.
-[Philip] Hello? Sweetie?

13:27.160 --> 13:28.720
-Your Majesty.
-[Elizabeth] Yes.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.920
-His Royal Highness the Duke of--
-Not me, I'm afraid.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.880
I'm "darling" or "cabbage."
"Sweetie" is someone else.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.840
[door opens]

13:35.920 --> 13:37.720
Ah, you see? It works.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.560
-You asked to see me.
-Yes.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.080
So...

13:49.120 --> 13:51.680
-I've spoken to Colonel Adeane.
-Yes.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.480
-And Martin Charteris.
-Yes.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.520
-And William Heseltine.
-Oh.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.720
A collection of the people
you most hate in life.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.600
-Hmm.
-Well, we all got together.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.320
In a reptile cage? At a zoo?

14:03.400 --> 14:07.600
No. It was decided that as part
of a new public relations initiative,

14:07.680 --> 14:09.720
-you're going to be launched.
-What?

14:10.320 --> 14:11.880
Well, not like a rocket.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.000
-Well, perhaps a bit like a rocket.
-Ah...

14:15.080 --> 14:16.360
[Philip] And to that end,

14:16.440 --> 14:19.200
I'd like you to participate,
alongside the whole family,

14:19.280 --> 14:21.840
in a landmark film
to be shown on television.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.920
Mm-hmm?

14:24.080 --> 14:26.000
I've told you the story, haven't I?

14:26.080 --> 14:28.320
That when I was a baby...

14:28.400 --> 14:30.280
-Yes.
-...we had to flee Greece.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.640
-Yes, in a lemon crate.
-An orange crate.

14:32.720 --> 14:36.880
And that was because the people had
taken against us as the royal family.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.640
From that moment on,
we were displaced.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.640
In exile.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.080
I was... I was without a proper home,
without a family.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.440
And I... I don't want that for us.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.880
I want people to like us,
to feel that they know us.

14:51.960 --> 14:52.840
[scoffs]

14:53.320 --> 14:55.440
I know you value your privacy,

14:55.520 --> 14:57.880
but I think there's a lot about you
that they would like

14:57.960 --> 14:59.280
if they... if they got a chance.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.840
The fact that, generally,
you're good value for money.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.960
Like a pair of long-lasting boots?

15:06.520 --> 15:10.560
Is there anything one loves more in life
than a pair of long-lasting boots?

15:13.400 --> 15:15.920
-It all sounds hideous.
-Yes.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.240
I thought that's what you'd say.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.800
But if you
and the other reptiles insist...

15:22.120 --> 15:23.400
I'm afraid we do.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.800
[door opens]

15:28.880 --> 15:30.320
-[door closes]
-[scoffs]

15:40.480 --> 15:41.640
[Queen Mother] A film?

15:41.720 --> 15:44.600
[Philip] Yes. It's a...
it's a documentary film.

15:46.640 --> 15:50.680
-Tony, do you want to...
-It means, um... no acting.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.200
No artifice. Just the real thing.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.960
Like one of those wildlife films.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.080
-Oh, I like those.
-Hmm.

15:58.760 --> 16:02.880
Yes, except this time,
we are the endangered species.

16:03.360 --> 16:06.120
[Philip] Yes, exactly. It will follow
all of us in our daily lives

16:06.200 --> 16:09.840
to prove to everyone out there
what we in here already know.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.000
-What's that?
-Well, how hard we all work.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.280
And what good value we represent.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.320
How much we deserve the taxpayers' money.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.960
So we'll all have to get used
to cameras being here all the time?

16:25.040 --> 16:28.120
Not all the time. They will follow us
on and off over the next few months.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.160
So, all of you on best behavior.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.120
It's jolly powerful that light, isn't it?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.680
Back it up, would you, Gary?

16:42.920 --> 16:44.720
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-Yes, thank you.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.800
[indistinct chatter]

16:53.000 --> 16:54.360
[man] Ronald Lee.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.200
David Salt.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.000
-Terry Edwards.
-Your Majesty.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.480
Sally Phipps.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.480
[Philip] It must all seem very glamorous.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.680
The British Olympic team for lunch,
the American President for dinner,

17:11.440 --> 17:12.600
but it's a lot of work,

17:12.680 --> 17:15.160
a lot of preparation,
and a lot of expense.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.920
In terms of what it actually achieves,

17:18.560 --> 17:20.880
I like think that it, we, are...

17:21.800 --> 17:23.200
worth every penny.

17:24.120 --> 17:25.560
[director] Gents, over here.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.200
Go on.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.120
-Good afternoon, Prime Minister.
-Afternoon.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.080
[Wilson] I was half-expecting cameras here
to greet me.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.960
Lights, microphones...

17:46.040 --> 17:47.080
Oh, you've heard?

17:47.160 --> 17:48.040
Yes.

17:48.120 --> 17:51.360
I'm afraid my husband is quite taken
by the idea of this documentary.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.600
And while
I might not understand television,

17:53.680 --> 17:55.040
I do understand marriage,

17:55.120 --> 17:57.400
and when it is important
to let someone shine.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.440
Now, we have a lot to catch up on,
not least a military coup in Athens.

18:01.520 --> 18:05.320
Yes, um... where, I believe,
your mother-in-law's still living.

18:06.280 --> 18:10.400
According to the Foreign Office,
it's possible she's in some danger.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.640
-[gunfire]
-[screaming]

18:12.720 --> 18:15.000
[announcer in Greek]
This is a public announcement.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.000
The government has fallen,

18:17.080 --> 18:21.520
and the military has assumed control
of the city and the country.

18:21.600 --> 18:27.000
All foreign nationals
must leave immediately.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.040
...a shot of the table and...

18:29.120 --> 18:31.600
And I'll sort of just chat
about preparations.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.160
We'll capture some of your conversations
with the staff.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.640
How long will that take?

18:36.720 --> 18:38.480
We should be ready any second.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.720
Is that the most recent shot list?

18:44.120 --> 18:46.120
-Carry on.
-Yes, sir.

18:50.640 --> 18:51.720
Hello, you.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.600
I spoke to the Prime Minister today.

18:54.680 --> 18:58.040
As you know, Athens is in the throes
of a military coup.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.720
Yes.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.640
The Foreign Office view is
that we should send a plane

19:02.720 --> 19:04.400
to bring your mother to England

19:04.480 --> 19:06.200
-to live here with us.
-Here?

19:06.280 --> 19:09.360
Yes, here. I'm sure you'll agree
there's room at the inn.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.160
-When?
-As soon as possible.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.560
-Tomorrow?
-We can't do that.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.400
-Why not?
-In case you hadn't noticed,

19:14.480 --> 19:17.120
we have cameras
crawling all over the place.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.800
As it happens, I had noticed.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.320
Well, we can't afford to have
my mother jeopardize this film.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.440
-You know what she's like.
-A little eccentric, yes.

19:24.520 --> 19:25.600
No, more than that.

19:25.680 --> 19:29.280
She's not of our world,
nor, frankly, suited to it. She's...

19:30.560 --> 19:34.520
She's been in institutions
most of her adult life. She's not...

19:35.360 --> 19:38.680
She's not well.
And with this film, appearances are vital.

19:38.760 --> 19:42.280
We need to be careful, very careful.
The answer is no.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.960
[Philip] Are you ready?

19:50.920 --> 19:52.400
[clears throat] Come on.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.440
-[director] Camera ready.
-[Philip] Hurry up.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.200
Of course she should come. She's 82.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.240
And if being mother
to the Duke of Edinburgh,

19:59.320 --> 20:01.920
mother-in-law to the Queen
isn't qualification enough,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.800
the fact that she's grandmother
to our future king is.

20:04.880 --> 20:06.200
Bring her over.

20:06.280 --> 20:09.360
Put her in a room next to Princess Anne.
She can keep an eye on her.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.840
Yes, ma'am.

20:16.440 --> 20:17.520
[clapperboard clicks]

20:20.040 --> 20:22.040
[chanting in Greek]

20:32.920 --> 20:38.480
[Alice in Greek] Goodbye, my dear family.

20:41.720 --> 20:42.880
Goodbye...

20:44.920 --> 20:47.600
my dear sisters.

20:51.680 --> 20:57.800
May the Lord bless you.

20:59.320 --> 21:03.640
May the Lord protect you.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.640
[in English] Thank you, dear.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.280
[groans]

22:22.320 --> 22:23.560
[exhales]

22:26.680 --> 22:27.960
Your Royal Highness.

22:29.840 --> 22:30.920
Thank you.

22:32.240 --> 22:33.480
Please, this way.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.520
Your Majesty.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.760
We're so happy to have you here with us,
safe and sound.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.040
You're very kind.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.520
Too kind.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.800
[exhales deeply]

23:11.360 --> 23:12.480
Bubbikins?

23:13.120 --> 23:16.200
I'm afraid your dear son is indisposed
at the moment.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.560
We're in the middle of having a film made.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.120
What?

23:21.880 --> 23:24.320
It doesn't matter.
He'll come and visit you soon.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.320
You must be tired. We'll find someone
to take you to your room.

23:27.560 --> 23:28.880
Thank you.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.840
-Bubbikins?
-Yes.

23:43.440 --> 23:44.640
[chuckles]

24:13.880 --> 24:16.040
Your room, Your Royal Highness.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.120
Oh!

24:18.600 --> 24:19.800
It's lovely.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.200
[Philip clears throat]

24:25.560 --> 24:28.760
Your Royal Highness, just to say
that Princess Alice has arrived.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.200
Thank you, Martin.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.440
[sighs]

25:09.560 --> 25:10.720
[Philip clears throat]

25:38.040 --> 25:41.360
[Alice speaks Greek]

25:43.400 --> 25:45.720
[in English] Mama, please! Please!

25:47.400 --> 25:48.320
Mama!

26:27.880 --> 26:29.960
Sir, they're ready for you.

26:39.240 --> 26:42.040
[man on TV] Early morning, semi-detached,
Highgate, London.

26:42.120 --> 26:45.240
-Industrial consultant Rex...
-[Queen Mother] They're rolling, dear.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.320
We are being filmed watching television.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.160
That people might watch us

26:51.640 --> 26:55.240
watching television
on their own television sets at home.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.360
This really is plumbing new depths
of banality.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.960
[man on TV] They're simple to operate,
and experts predict

27:04.040 --> 27:05.440
that in 20 years' time,

27:05.520 --> 27:08.640
all new houses will be built
with special computer points

27:08.720 --> 27:10.680
and that terminals
will be cheaper to rent

27:10.760 --> 27:12.040
than today's telephones.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.440
-What do we do now?
-Do you expect us to say something?

27:16.480 --> 27:18.520
-Yes.
-Well, what?

27:18.600 --> 27:20.280
Did someone prepare something?

27:20.680 --> 27:22.080
[director] I think the general idea

27:22.160 --> 27:24.920
is it be unscripted
to reflect a normal evening.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.760
[Margaret]
This is nothing like a normal evening.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.480
If it was a normal evening,

27:29.560 --> 27:35.200
we'd all be on our own
in sad isolation in individual palaces.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.000
It wouldn't be crowded like this.

27:37.080 --> 27:40.600
This is like
some kind of nightmare Christmas.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.000
Rex Malik sees a future world

27:42.080 --> 27:44.600
where children could be
virtually educated by computer,

27:44.680 --> 27:46.640
where every home
will have its own terminal

27:46.720 --> 27:47.880
plugged into a central brain...

27:47.960 --> 27:50.840
Uh, perhaps, Your Majesties,
Your Royal Highnesses,

27:50.920 --> 27:54.120
perhaps you might comment
on what's on the television.

27:55.280 --> 27:59.680
That'd be easier if there was something
remotely amusing to watch.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.160
I agree. This is deathly.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.200
Things might improve with a drink.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.800
Everything improves with a drink.

28:04.880 --> 28:05.920
Not everything.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.840
Oh, don't be such a prig.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.480
[snaps fingers] Colin.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.480
-[director] And cut.
-[Margaret] Oh, thank God for that.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.480
[Alice sighs]

28:31.400 --> 28:32.560
Hello?

28:37.800 --> 28:38.840
Hello?

28:58.720 --> 29:00.360
Hello, dear.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.600
Do you mind?

29:03.400 --> 29:05.280
No, no, not at all.

29:05.400 --> 29:08.600
There wasn't a light to be had
anywhere in the palace.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.320
[director] Who's that?

29:12.640 --> 29:16.600
The Duke of Edinburgh's mother,
Princess Alice of Greece and Denmark.

29:18.840 --> 29:19.840
[snaps fingers]

29:36.760 --> 29:38.880
[indistinct chatter]

29:38.960 --> 29:40.000
[Philip] For God's sake.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.480
Somebody stop that.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.400
[shouts] Now! Damn it!

29:50.320 --> 29:51.960
[director] Tell us about your convent.

29:52.680 --> 29:58.720
[Alice] Yes, it's called
the Sisterhood of Martha and Mary,

29:58.800 --> 30:02.120
and it's at 10 Pefkon Street in Athens.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.120
[director] Tell us more about Greece.
Is Greece in trouble today?

30:07.200 --> 30:08.960
Is that what brought you to this...

30:09.520 --> 30:10.440
Stop.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.520
[indistinct chatter]

30:31.240 --> 30:34.040
It's a nightmare.
We have to get her out of here.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.840
-Somewhere no one will see her.
-What?

30:35.920 --> 30:37.880
We are in the middle
of filming a documentary,

30:37.960 --> 30:40.400
which is critical
as a public relations exercise.

30:40.480 --> 30:43.000
On this occasion, the filmmakers
agreed to give up the footage.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.240
Next time, they might not be so kind.

30:45.800 --> 30:49.840
Her presence at the palace threatens
to derail the entire thing.

30:49.920 --> 30:52.120
-Why are you so angry with her?
-I'm not angry.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.440
Yes, you are. You're furious.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.960
Have you even been to see her yet
since she arrived?

30:59.400 --> 31:02.000
-You haven't.
-Let me give you some advice.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.560
Stop patronizing me!

31:04.800 --> 31:08.720
Stop interfering and stop meddling.
Just stop. You know nothing.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.800
I know that she's your mother.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.280
-Technically, yes.
-What is that supposed to mean?

31:20.360 --> 31:22.240
It means she gave birth to me.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.440
She was never a mother.

31:26.800 --> 31:27.720
Philip.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.640
Philip!

31:35.880 --> 31:36.960
[door slams]

31:49.640 --> 31:52.840
Rosa came running to me
in the middle of the night and said,

31:52.920 --> 31:55.880
"We have to get more buckets!"

31:55.960 --> 31:58.520
It was like listening
to an orchestra overnight.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.400
Ping, pong, ping...

32:00.480 --> 32:01.520
[laughter]

32:01.600 --> 32:03.320
It was really quite funny,

32:03.400 --> 32:06.720
except, of course,
we were all soaking wet and jolly cold.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.160
[Elizabeth] Ah, two of you.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.160
-Your Majesty.
-Oh.

32:14.240 --> 32:18.320
Yaya's been telling me the most
incredible stories about her life.

32:18.400 --> 32:19.400
[Elizabeth] Has she?

32:19.640 --> 32:22.320
I just came to make sure
you had everything you need. Please.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.440
Oh, yes. I have more than everything.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.080
But her convent doesn't.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.760
-Darling, shush.
-It needs £200 for the roof.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.280
-Really?
-It's true.

32:32.480 --> 32:36.240
And £300 for new medicine and beds.

32:36.320 --> 32:39.680
So, we're busy writing to patrons
and benefactors, asking for money.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.160
The palace writing paper...

32:42.920 --> 32:44.480
we think it could help.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.960
And if there's anything here
we might consider selling.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.000
Such as?

32:51.120 --> 32:52.000
A painting.

32:52.760 --> 32:53.880
A painting?

32:56.040 --> 32:56.920
Or a clock.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.360
There are so many clocks everywhere.

33:00.840 --> 33:03.560
You wouldn't miss one or two, surely?

33:03.680 --> 33:07.640
It's not quite so simple.
Some of them aren't ours to sell.

33:08.760 --> 33:12.080
But maybe your darling son
will be good enough to make a donation.

33:12.960 --> 33:13.880
Oh.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.160
Bubbikins.

33:18.920 --> 33:19.840
Yes, Bubbikins.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
In the meantime,
we'll get you some more cigarettes,

33:24.080 --> 33:28.960
and I promise we'll have a big jumble sale
of all the palace valuables on our return.

33:30.440 --> 33:31.480
Please.

33:36.240 --> 33:37.200
What?

33:42.160 --> 33:44.040
-Morning, Bridget.
-Morning, John.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.920
-[Bridget] Excited to watch tonight?
-[John] I couldn't be more excited.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.960
-Morning, Bridget.
-Good morning.

34:02.560 --> 34:03.400
Right.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.200
Turn it on.

34:07.480 --> 34:08.520
[switch clicks]

34:10.880 --> 34:15.160
Buckingham Palace, known around the world
as the home of Queen Elizabeth II.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.840
-Until now, an impenetrable fortress...
-[Elizabeth gasps] Here we go.

34:18.920 --> 34:20.680
...its inner workings hidden from view.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.920
That is all about to change.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.120
We have been granted
a rare peek behind the curtains

34:26.200 --> 34:29.000
to the home
of the most important family in Britain.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.520
As the day begins...

34:31.880 --> 34:33.840
Oh, no, my hair looks frightful.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.720
How many pounds do they say
the camera adds, dear?

34:36.800 --> 34:38.800
-[laughter]
-Shush.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.760
-But like many of her subjects...
-Turn it up.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.440
...the Queen has an office job,
and with five departments to manage,

34:43.520 --> 34:45.760
she relies heavily
on her private secretaries.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.880
Thank you.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.160
[Adeane] And these are the...

34:49.960 --> 34:51.360
recommendations for the...

34:51.440 --> 34:55.120
[narrator] These men manage all the
Queen's engagements and responsibilities,

34:55.200 --> 34:58.120
and nothing goes on in the palace
without their knowledge.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.800
As the day goes on,
it brings with it more royal duties.

35:01.880 --> 35:03.560
[man]
I hereby list the following titles...

35:03.640 --> 35:06.360
[narrator] First of all,
a meeting of the Privy Council.

35:07.160 --> 35:10.320
Now, you might be wondering
why no one is sitting down.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.640
Well, no one quite knows the answer.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.960
But it certainly helps
to keep things brief.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.440
[Anne] I wonder what's more dull,

35:18.040 --> 35:19.680
having to sit through
one of those meetings

35:19.760 --> 35:21.080
or having to watch it on television.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.800
[narrator] But it's not only the Queen
who has royal duties.

35:23.880 --> 35:26.760
The Queen Mother, too,
carries out many public engagements.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.960
Well, they captured your best side,
at least.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.240
-[laughs]
-[Philip] Shush.

35:32.240 --> 35:35.400
Oh, look, Mummy. It's your big close-up.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.320
I'm ready, Mr. DeMille!

35:37.800 --> 35:39.800
[laughter]

35:40.720 --> 35:43.120
[narrator]
One of Her Majesty's favorite pastimes

35:43.200 --> 35:47.480
is overseeing operations
at the 150-acre stud at Sandringham.

35:47.680 --> 35:50.720
But even then, royal duties never let up.

35:53.560 --> 35:56.360
Nor does the endless round
of functions and receptions.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.720
There's always some kind of occasion
to prepare for,

36:00.800 --> 36:02.080
and, whatever the function,

36:02.160 --> 36:05.360
the quality of food and service
must be second to none.

36:06.760 --> 36:10.960
These events may seem indulgent,
but they are of national importance,

36:11.560 --> 36:12.840
as is the formality.

36:13.240 --> 36:16.040
Ambassadors must be treated
exactly the same

36:16.120 --> 36:19.040
to avoid the impression
that one is favored over another.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.080
[ambassador]
It's been a great honor, Your Majesty.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.160
I found it very interesting, Ambassador.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.560
World problems are so complex,
aren't they?

36:25.640 --> 36:27.880
[narrator]
Of course, it's not all dinners and duty.

36:28.280 --> 36:32.000
Although the Queen and Prince Philip
are often separated from their children,

36:32.080 --> 36:34.600
the holidays are a time for family,

36:34.680 --> 36:37.480
and they make sure to take them
regularly and often.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.280
-Night, John.
-Night, Sally.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.920
[bagpipes play]

36:41.000 --> 36:43.760
[narrator] A favorite destination
is Balmoral Castle...

36:43.840 --> 36:44.720
[laughs]

36:44.800 --> 36:47.240
...the Queen's private residence
in the Highlands of Scotland.

36:48.320 --> 36:52.120
[John] "Last night, the nation
tuned in as one to watch a documentary

36:52.640 --> 36:56.240
that would restore the royal family
to their rightful place

36:56.320 --> 36:58.640
at the heart of the nation's affections.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.560
Sadly, that was not what they got.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.800
It's hard to imagine
what they were thinking,

37:06.200 --> 37:09.480
agreeing to open the doors
to television cameras.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.880
That stripped of all ceremony
and mystery,

37:12.960 --> 37:18.120
we would marvel at how normal they were,
how remarkably like us.

37:19.760 --> 37:22.560
That watching them travel
from castle to castle,

37:22.640 --> 37:27.320
palace to palace
in yachts and aeroplanes we pay for,

37:27.520 --> 37:32.240
stalking on land they own,
fishing on rivers they own,

37:32.320 --> 37:35.240
and cooking barbecues
in forests they own,

37:35.440 --> 37:38.840
we would reflect on
how tirelessly they toil,

37:38.920 --> 37:41.080
what good value for money they represent,

37:41.160 --> 37:44.200
and be moved to increase
the amount of money we pay them."

37:44.280 --> 37:47.280
-[laughter]
-Louder, John. Don't be shy! Come on!

37:47.360 --> 37:49.160
Let's all hear it. Come on, John.

37:49.240 --> 37:52.760
-Come on.
-"Even the most ardent monarchist

37:52.840 --> 37:57.880
must concede that the strongest piece
of armor in the monarchy's arsenal

37:57.960 --> 37:59.480
is its sense of mystery,

37:59.560 --> 38:03.760
-from which derives its air of majesty."
-[woman] Hear, hear!

38:04.800 --> 38:07.800
"The only thing awe-inspiring
about this lot

38:07.880 --> 38:11.480
is the size of their over-inflated
sense of self-entitlement...

38:11.560 --> 38:13.840
[laughter]

38:14.200 --> 38:17.200
...and their ability
to practice a line in small talk

38:17.280 --> 38:20.240
that would have life support patients
reaching for the off switch."

38:20.320 --> 38:21.480
[cheering]

38:21.560 --> 38:23.360
Well done, John. Well done.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.960
[Wilson] Wonderful viewing figures.

38:47.040 --> 38:50.560
The highest
for a factual documentary ever.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.160
And some lovely reviews
in the newspapers this morning.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.120
-They were brutal.
-None that I read.

39:10.360 --> 39:14.600
I like to think I understand television
as well as anyone in the country.

39:15.640 --> 39:18.040
I owe my political life to it.

39:19.120 --> 39:22.800
And that's because I've learned,
over time, how to do it.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.200
How to make it work for me.

39:26.040 --> 39:29.960
Perhaps the royal family
is not best suited to it.

39:31.240 --> 39:34.880
-Television is good for normal people.
-But that was the whole point.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.560
To show everyone that behind palace gates,
we are perfectly normal people.

39:38.840 --> 39:42.040
-No, ma'am, you're not normal.
-Aren't we?

39:42.680 --> 39:45.720
We wake up in the morning,
go to bed at night.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.680
We work, get tired, get colds.

39:49.160 --> 39:52.240
We have uncles that embarrass us,
Christmases to endure.

39:52.320 --> 39:53.600
We are perfectly normal.

39:53.680 --> 39:57.320
But people don't consider you to be and...

39:59.200 --> 40:02.440
if I may say, and this is where
it gets a little complicated...

40:04.840 --> 40:06.480
they don't want you to be normal.

40:07.560 --> 40:11.400
Well, what do they want? Tell me.
It's all any of us want to know.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.200
What do you want from us?

40:13.280 --> 40:15.480
Well, the truth is,
we don't know what we want.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.640
[scoffs]

40:18.040 --> 40:20.960
Other than we want you to be ideal.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.440
An ideal.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.880
No human being is ideal.

40:27.560 --> 40:29.640
Only God is ideal.

40:30.960 --> 40:34.120
Which is why I'd favor the royal family
being kept out of sight,

40:34.680 --> 40:35.920
out of mind,

40:36.680 --> 40:38.600
for our own survival and sanity.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.880
But the thing is we can't be hidden away.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.920
We have to be in full view all the time.

40:45.120 --> 40:46.440
So, what's the answer?

40:47.960 --> 40:51.800
The best we've come up with so far
is ritual and mystery.

40:52.640 --> 40:55.720
Because it keeps us hidden
while still in plain sight.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.160
The smoke and the mirrors,

40:58.720 --> 41:00.520
the mystery and the protocol,

41:00.800 --> 41:03.040
it's not there to keep us apart.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.280
It is there to keep us alive.

41:17.480 --> 41:19.480
[footsteps approach]

41:29.160 --> 41:31.000
-You rang?
-[Philip] Yes.

41:32.520 --> 41:33.640
Sit down.

41:43.640 --> 41:44.720
[Philip clears throat]

41:47.080 --> 41:51.000
Well, it seems the documentary not only
failed to achieve what I had hoped for,

41:51.080 --> 41:53.760
it has somehow achieved the opposite.

41:54.200 --> 41:57.160
Instead of writing about
what good value for money we represent,

41:58.400 --> 42:01.960
these commentators are united
in their mockery of our...

42:02.680 --> 42:05.400
our woodenness, our stupidity,

42:05.640 --> 42:08.240
our vanity, extravagance--

42:08.320 --> 42:10.600
-Well, I did warn you.
-Do not say you warned me.

42:10.680 --> 42:11.560
I did.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.480
It was always a daft idea.
It was always going to backfire.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.640
Is it really necessary for you
to speak your mind

42:16.720 --> 42:18.600
quite so mercilessly at every opportunity?

42:18.680 --> 42:20.640
Well, where do you think I get that from?

42:23.000 --> 42:23.960
[sighs]

42:31.920 --> 42:33.440
So, what are you going to do?

42:36.360 --> 42:37.560
[sighs]

42:37.640 --> 42:41.240
Actually, I was hoping we might talk
about what you're going to do.

42:42.400 --> 42:46.040
I would like to offer you
to The Manchester Guardian

42:46.720 --> 42:49.960
as the subject of a major,
in-depth profile.

42:50.040 --> 42:52.920
Why them? Why not The Daily Telegraph,
or the Daily Mail,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.720
or someone we could expect
to be a little bit friendly?

42:55.800 --> 42:58.800
Because,
in the light of all this criticism,

42:59.480 --> 43:03.920
an endorsement from our most vocal critics
would represent more of a turnaround.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.560
If we can get an endorsement.

43:05.640 --> 43:07.800
You're the most thrifty,
feet on the ground,

43:07.880 --> 43:10.600
low-profile,
unpretentious royal we've got.

43:11.880 --> 43:14.840
If anyone can salvage this, you can.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.760
[Philip] Give me the press secretary.

43:39.480 --> 43:43.040
John, I've just had a phone call
from the palace press secretary.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.160
Oh, let me guess, demanding an apology,

43:45.240 --> 43:47.840
calling my criticism unpatriotic,
treasonous...

43:47.920 --> 43:50.680
No, to offer us an interview
with Princess Anne.

43:50.760 --> 43:52.880
What? Little Miss Dumpy and Grumpy?

43:52.960 --> 43:55.240
Yes, and, uh, most bizarrely of all,

43:55.320 --> 43:58.200
they've specifically requested you
as the writer.

43:59.160 --> 44:00.960
Oh, they really have gone mad.

44:06.280 --> 44:08.880
-North central gate, please, sir.
-[driver] Right you are.

44:14.800 --> 44:18.640
John Armstrong
from The Guardian to see Anne.

44:18.920 --> 44:19.960
Who?

44:21.040 --> 44:24.720
-Princess Anne, for the interview?
-Yes, sir. Right this way.

44:33.880 --> 44:36.440
-Wait here, please, sir.
-Thank you.

44:59.240 --> 45:00.760
-Now, Yaya.
-What?

45:04.920 --> 45:05.960
Run.

45:07.040 --> 45:07.960
Go!

45:10.840 --> 45:11.880
[coughs]

45:37.200 --> 45:38.760
[footsteps approaching]

45:40.960 --> 45:43.560
Mr. Armstrong,
did you not receive the message?

45:43.640 --> 45:46.080
Her Royal Highness Princess Anne
is-is, um...

45:47.960 --> 45:49.040
is unwell,

45:49.480 --> 45:52.040
with a heavy cold, and is indisposed.

45:53.040 --> 45:56.040
-No, they didn't tell me.
-I'm so sorry. I'll see you out.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.280
-Who's that?
-Um, who?

45:58.360 --> 45:59.360
The nun.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.080
That's, uh...

46:02.000 --> 46:04.600
-That's Princess Alice.
-Who?

46:05.120 --> 46:07.680
Mother of His Royal Highness
Duke of Edinburgh.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.920
-[clears throat]
-Oh, do you think she'd talk to me?

46:11.000 --> 46:13.720
Uh, no, certainly not.
Uh, so, if you don't mind...

46:14.160 --> 46:17.000
-I could ask her myself.
-No, that wouldn't be appropriate.

46:17.080 --> 46:18.520
-Please, Mr. Armstrong--
-Hello.

46:19.280 --> 46:20.880
Hello, I'm John Armstrong.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.480
I'm writing an article about
the royal family for The Guardian.

46:23.560 --> 46:26.120
-Can I ask you some questions?
-What?

46:26.200 --> 46:29.040
I'm John Armstrong from The Guardian.
Could we have an interview?

46:29.360 --> 46:32.080
-Yes, of course.
-She said yes.

46:35.240 --> 46:36.280
[Alice coughs]

46:44.120 --> 46:46.320
So, my dear, how can I help you?

46:46.720 --> 46:50.320
Well, I think the people in this country

46:50.600 --> 46:54.320
would be very interested to get to know
the Queen's mother-in-law.

46:54.880 --> 46:57.440
-Really?
-Oh, yes. So...

46:58.120 --> 47:00.440
We should start from the very beginning.

47:01.040 --> 47:02.720
But I'm ancient.

47:03.240 --> 47:06.800
-We could be here a long time.
-And I have all the time in the world.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Well...

47:13.720 --> 47:16.000
I was born in Windsor Castle.

47:17.160 --> 47:20.160
Queen Victoria herself was present
at my birth.

47:20.240 --> 47:21.160
Was she?

47:22.560 --> 47:25.160
Everyone thought I was a slow child.

47:25.240 --> 47:27.880
Slow? In which sense?

47:27.960 --> 47:29.680
-Walking?
-No, dear.

47:30.680 --> 47:31.760
[coughs]

47:33.840 --> 47:35.440
Slow in here.

47:37.440 --> 47:38.360
Right.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.560
I was born deaf.

47:42.640 --> 47:43.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.480
But otherwise perfectly normal?

47:46.560 --> 47:48.280
Well, I thought so.

47:49.480 --> 47:50.880
But obviously others didn't,

47:50.960 --> 47:53.680
because then
I was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

47:55.920 --> 47:57.360
[takes notes]

47:57.440 --> 47:59.440
And sent to an asylum.

48:01.360 --> 48:02.600
A mental asylum?

48:02.920 --> 48:03.920
Yes.

48:06.800 --> 48:09.560
I was treated by Sigmund Freud.

48:15.920 --> 48:17.960
He was not a kind man.

48:25.880 --> 48:26.840
Go on.

48:29.280 --> 48:32.080
I was there for just over two years.

48:32.160 --> 48:33.360
Mm-hmm.

48:33.440 --> 48:35.640
And I managed to escape.

48:39.200 --> 48:43.080
-[indistinct conversation]
-[typewriter clicks]

48:56.040 --> 48:57.920
[phone rings]

50:01.760 --> 50:04.160
[prays]

50:37.960 --> 50:39.280
Bubbikins.

50:50.200 --> 50:51.240
[clears throat]

50:58.480 --> 51:01.880
"It is a common staple
of mother-in-law jokes...

51:02.920 --> 51:05.360
that having one come to stay
is a nightmare.

51:06.200 --> 51:09.160
But having this mother-in-law to stay
can only be a blessing."

51:09.680 --> 51:10.600
Oh.

51:11.120 --> 51:13.320
"For Princess Alice is
that rarest of creatures...

51:14.240 --> 51:19.040
a member of a royal family that has
suffered more than the rest of us,

51:19.480 --> 51:21.200
worked harder than the rest of us,

51:21.680 --> 51:23.920
and created more good than the rest of us.

51:28.880 --> 51:32.920
Congenitally deaf,
she was consistently misunderstood,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.200
marginalized and underestimated.

51:36.160 --> 51:38.800
Doctors inflicted untold horrors on her,

51:39.640 --> 51:43.520
X-raying her womb to bring on menopause
and reduce her libido...

51:50.320 --> 51:54.400
and electroshock treatment
to treat her hysteria.

51:55.080 --> 51:56.760
But instead of bitterness,

51:57.360 --> 52:01.520
Princess Alice dedicated her life
to charity work, public service,

52:01.600 --> 52:06.160
and campaigning for social justice,
often at great personal risk."

52:09.160 --> 52:10.680
Well, it goes on and on.

52:14.560 --> 52:15.800
It's a love letter.

52:26.480 --> 52:27.960
I owe you an apology.

52:30.760 --> 52:32.320
Whatever for?

52:32.400 --> 52:33.800
My faithlessness.

52:34.400 --> 52:37.960
All this time, I've been trying
to keep you out of sight of the cameras,

52:38.040 --> 52:41.480
when, quite clearly,
you should have been center stage.

52:43.760 --> 52:47.400
If anyone owes anyone an apology,

52:48.280 --> 52:50.520
we both know it's the other way round.

52:51.760 --> 52:55.320
At least your sisters had something
of their mother.

52:58.400 --> 53:03.480
When we were forced to leave Greece,
I couldn't cope.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.480
I needed care.

53:12.360 --> 53:13.760
I needed help.

53:14.160 --> 53:17.200
But that... that wasn't help
that they gave you.

53:18.160 --> 53:19.040
It was torture.

53:19.880 --> 53:22.240
-They tried their best.
-No.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.800
The treatment they gave you was barbaric.

53:25.320 --> 53:29.280
And your courage in rising above it
was remarkable.

53:30.400 --> 53:32.400
I didn't do it alone.

53:34.760 --> 53:36.080
I couldn't have.

53:38.400 --> 53:41.640
I had help every step of the way.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.240
Now, Bubbikins,
you mentioned faithlessness.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.480
How is your faith?

53:53.880 --> 53:55.960
-Dormant.
-What?

53:58.360 --> 53:59.360
Dormant.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.640
That's not good.

54:13.280 --> 54:16.520
Let this be a mother's gift...

54:17.800 --> 54:19.160
to her child.

54:21.400 --> 54:23.560
The one piece of advice...

54:29.520 --> 54:31.720
Find yourself a faith.

54:35.160 --> 54:37.040
It helps. No...

54:40.360 --> 54:42.000
Not just helps.

54:46.520 --> 54:48.000
It's everything.

55:00.120 --> 55:02.520
Oh, it looks like it's clearing up.

55:04.520 --> 55:07.040
What do you say? A walk?

55:17.480 --> 55:21.400
So, we'll move lunch
with Lord and Lady Casey to the 12th,

55:21.480 --> 55:24.440
meaning there's enough time
for the presentation of the Queen's Colour

55:24.520 --> 55:28.160
to the Central Flying School
at RAF Little Rissington on the 9th.

55:28.560 --> 55:31.440
Well done. Thank you, Michael.
Is that everything?

55:33.440 --> 55:35.040
There is one more thing, ma'am.

55:35.600 --> 55:38.480
The royal family documentary

55:38.560 --> 55:41.360
has had a great deal of interest
from overseas broadcasters.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.560
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,

55:43.640 --> 55:45.480
the Australian Broadcasting Corporation,

55:45.560 --> 55:47.040
-CBS in the United States--
-No.

55:48.200 --> 55:50.040
-Ma'am?
-I don't think so.

55:50.960 --> 55:51.960
Right.

55:53.240 --> 55:57.040
I gather the BBC plans to repeat it
in three weeks' time.

55:57.120 --> 55:58.680
I don't think that either.

55:59.680 --> 56:03.400
As a matter of fact, I think it best if
that documentary were never seen again,

56:03.480 --> 56:05.280
anywhere, by anyone.

56:09.280 --> 56:10.840
Can I leave that with you?

56:12.200 --> 56:13.320
Yes, ma'am.

56:24.360 --> 56:25.560
[sighs]

56:40.720 --> 56:42.720
[indistinct chatter]
