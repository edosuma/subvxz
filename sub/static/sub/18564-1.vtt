[ Woman, Indistinct ]

02:37.908 --> 02:39.577
It's probably any time after that.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.996
[ Woman #2 ]
But he seems so healthy.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.707
[ Woman #1, Indistinct ]

02:44.790 --> 02:46.584
[ Woman #2 ]
Does he know?

02:46.667 --> 02:49.670
[ Woman #1, Indistinct ]

02:54.049 --> 02:55.551
[ Machine Beeping ]

03:12.902 --> 03:14.361
- Mr. Brovik?
- What? What?

03:14.445 --> 03:17.865
Can you all come into the office now,
please? Mr. Solness just woke up.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.242
Oh, thank - thank you.

03:20.326 --> 03:23.829
I don't know how much longer
I'll be able to stand this.

03:23.913 --> 03:26.832
Oh, God, you haven't been
looking well all afternoon.

03:26.916 --> 03:28.876
It's, uh -

03:28.959 --> 03:31.795
I think it's getting worse every day.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.548
M-Maybe this isn't a good time, Father.

03:34.632 --> 03:38.260
Maybe... you should
just go home and try to sleep a little.

03:38.344 --> 03:41.889
You mean just lie down
and get a little rest?

03:41.972 --> 03:45.976
When I lie down, that -
that other thing starts -

03:48.646 --> 03:50.314
the choking.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.912
[ Groans ]

04:10.084 --> 04:13.003
So, has anyone been here looking for me?

04:13.087 --> 04:16.464
Uh... yes.

04:16.548 --> 04:21.428
Uh, that young couple came by.

04:21.512 --> 04:25.432
You know, the people who want
to build the villa out by the lake.

04:25.516 --> 04:29.603
They've already been here
two or three times this week.

04:29.687 --> 04:32.314
Well, they're gonna have to wait.

04:32.398 --> 04:34.567
I'm not sure about the design.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.444
Well, they kept saying
that it's terribly important...

04:37.528 --> 04:39.113
that they get the drawings soon.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.949
Oh, is that right?

04:42.032 --> 04:45.411
Well, they said they were just so eager...

04:45.494 --> 04:48.122
to move into their own place.

04:48.205 --> 04:52.459
A place. A place to move into.

04:52.543 --> 04:56.380
That's not the same as a home.
Don't they see that?

04:57.715 --> 04:59.675
Well, it's absolutely fine...

04:59.758 --> 05:02.636
but then they should go
to somebody else, leave me out of it.

05:03.220 --> 05:06.640
Why don't you just tell them that
when they come back next time?

05:06.724 --> 05:08.726
Go to somebody else?

05:09.768 --> 05:13.063
Do you... honestly mean that?

05:13.147 --> 05:16.150
Yes, I do, for God's sake.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.360
They want me to just put up a building...

05:18.444 --> 05:22.656
without taking the time
to work out a meaningful design.

05:22.740 --> 05:25.159
I mean, I don't even
really know these people.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.911
Oh, they're very good people.

05:27.995 --> 05:32.666
Ragnar knows them.
He's visited them often.

05:32.750 --> 05:35.002
Everyone here at Lovestrand...

05:35.085 --> 05:39.256
wants a building designed by me...

05:39.340 --> 05:43.344
as a sort of symbol of prestige.

05:43.427 --> 05:48.015
Well, I'm sick of it. I don't want to deal
with strangers anymore.

05:49.183 --> 05:52.186
Let them go to anyone they like.
I really don't care.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.813
Uh...

05:57.691 --> 06:01.278
do you think we might
have a few moments...

06:01.362 --> 06:04.073
to discuss something in private?

06:05.282 --> 06:06.700
Of course.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.952
- Will you give us a minute, dear?
- I don't -

06:09.036 --> 06:12.539
Please, Ragnar,
just give us a moment alone.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.667
Come on, Kaya.

06:16.752 --> 06:21.715
I, uh - I don't want the children
to know how sick I am.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.885
Yes, you've been looking...

06:24.968 --> 06:26.679
awfully weak recently.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.682
I'm not going to be around much longer.

06:29.765 --> 06:32.309
That's the reality.

06:32.393 --> 06:35.312
Each day I seem
to lose something or other -

06:35.396 --> 06:37.398
one more faculty.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.483
It's all going - all my strength.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.110
Yes.

06:41.193 --> 06:46.407
You see, what weighs on me
so terribly is...

06:46.490 --> 06:49.576
what's going to become of Ragnar?

06:49.660 --> 06:54.123
Well, I mean, he can stay here with me
for as long as he likes.

06:54.665 --> 06:58.836
You see, apparently, he feels
that he just can't stay any longer.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.255
What are you saying?

07:01.338 --> 07:03.257
Does he want a raise?

07:03.340 --> 07:05.551
No.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.762
It's more that the day has to come...

07:08.846 --> 07:12.266
when he'll have the opportunity
to do his own work.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.727
Oh, I see.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.938
And are you positive that he has...

07:18.021 --> 07:22.192
all the particular qualities
he would need for that?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.031
No.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.451
That's what's so awful.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.703
I'm not positive.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.874
Even I, myself, have begun
to doubt his abilities.

07:36.957 --> 07:42.880
But you have never said
one single encouraging word about him.

07:43.505 --> 07:47.801
But I know in my heart
that he is talented.

07:47.885 --> 07:52.014
But he just hasn't fully
mastered that much of the discipline.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.308
I mean, he knows how to draw.

07:54.391 --> 07:58.270
You hadn't mastered that much
of the discipline either...

07:58.353 --> 08:00.314
when you were working for me.

08:00.397 --> 08:04.818
[ Sniffles ]
But that didn't stop you from...

08:04.902 --> 08:06.653
plunging in -

08:07.362 --> 08:10.407
[ Sighing ]

08:11.575 --> 08:14.161
And seizing the moment...

08:14.244 --> 08:16.789
<i>and making a tremendous impression
on everyone.</i>

08:16.872 --> 08:21.001
No. It didn't stop you
from luring away the wind...

08:21.084 --> 08:23.629
that was in my sails at the time.

08:23.712 --> 08:28.675
It didn't stop you from just rushing past
everyone around you.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.513
Yes, it worked out that way, didn't it?

08:32.596 --> 08:35.349
Oh, yes. It did.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.683
That's the way it worked out.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.645
[ Machinery Continues Beeping ]

08:41.772 --> 08:44.024
<i>[Beeping Faster]</i>

08:47.152 --> 08:48.946
Seriously, you can't -

08:50.364 --> 08:53.534
You can't let me go to my grave...

08:53.617 --> 08:55.869
without having a chance...

08:55.953 --> 08:58.497
to see what Ragnar can make of himself.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.749
He needs to be married.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.043
Is that what Kaya wants?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.963
Well...

09:06.046 --> 09:10.217
maybe she's a little less passionate
about it than he is...

09:10.300 --> 09:13.804
but Ragnar talks about it all day long.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.056
He needs to be married...

09:16.139 --> 09:19.059
and I need to see some work
that my boy has done.

09:19.142 --> 09:22.062
Yes, but -
[ Chuckles ]

09:22.145 --> 09:26.066
I can't bring commissions
down out of the sky for him.

09:26.149 --> 09:29.987
He could obtain
an excellent commission right now...

09:30.070 --> 09:32.197
as a matter of fact -

09:32.281 --> 09:35.284
an important project,
something really worthwhile.

09:35.367 --> 09:38.036
- He could?
- Yes, he could.

09:39.371 --> 09:42.374
If you would give your permission.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.336
And what project is that?

09:48.922 --> 09:51.758
He could build the villa out at the lake.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.303
What?

09:55.846 --> 10:00.350
But I'm going to be doing
that project myself.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.896
But you no longer
have any desire to do it.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.023
I no longer have any desire to do it?

10:06.106 --> 10:09.943
Who in the world had the audacity
to tell you that?

10:10.027 --> 10:14.156
You - [ Chuckles ]
You said it yourself two minutes ago.

10:15.991 --> 10:19.578
Oh, for God's sake, I was joking.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.461
But seriously...

10:27.544 --> 10:31.798
could Ragnar really get that commission?

10:31.882 --> 10:35.636
Oh, yes. He knows the family well.

10:35.719 --> 10:40.474
Actually, for his own amusement,
he did do a few sketches...

10:40.557 --> 10:43.226
of some things he might do -

10:43.310 --> 10:46.605
a few drawings, a few estimates.

10:46.688 --> 10:50.776
And you think that the family
was pleased by these drawings?

10:50.859 --> 10:53.320
Oh, yes, yes.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.448
I mean, if you would simply
give your approval.

10:56.531 --> 11:00.619
Then they'd actually let Ragnar
complete the building?

11:01.745 --> 11:03.538
Well, they - they liked -

11:03.622 --> 11:07.709
they liked what he proposed
to them very much.

11:07.793 --> 11:10.671
They said they thought it was original...

11:10.754 --> 11:13.423
something really new.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.009
Oh, I see.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.594
Really new.

11:19.846 --> 11:23.517
Not like the sort
of very conventional buildings...

11:23.600 --> 11:25.602
that I always build...

11:25.686 --> 11:28.271
with their flavor of the past?

11:28.355 --> 11:30.023
Look, look, look, y-you're -

11:30.107 --> 11:34.277
So, it was actually Ragnar
they came here to see.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.030
No, no. They - They came
to see you, really.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.366
Really, they did. They simply -

11:39.449 --> 11:41.952
Oh.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.287
Oh, they simply wanted to know...

11:44.371 --> 11:47.040
- if you might be willing to step aside -
- Step aside?

11:47.124 --> 11:49.001
In case you found
that Ragnar's drawings -

11:49.084 --> 11:51.378
To step aside for Ragnar?

11:51.461 --> 11:54.047
They simply meant, you know,
to take your name.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.842
Oh, no. I understand what they meant.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.557
Well, well.
So the moment has come...

12:03.640 --> 12:08.812
when Halvard Solness
starts to "step aside"...

12:08.895 --> 12:12.232
to make way for those who are younger.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.817
That's wonderful.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.278
But surely...

12:16.361 --> 12:20.407
there's room for more
than one single solitary -

12:20.490 --> 12:23.035
No, no, no. Not really.

12:23.118 --> 12:27.122
No, there isn't
as much room as you think.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.586
In any case, it's irrelevant...

12:32.669 --> 12:36.339
because I'm not going to step aside.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.055
Oh.

12:43.138 --> 12:49.394
So... am I really going
to leave this earth...

12:52.230 --> 12:57.319
without the happiness,
w-without the conf -

12:58.737 --> 13:03.158
I mean, am I going to go to my grave...

13:03.241 --> 13:06.870
without being able to see
a single piece of work...

13:06.953 --> 13:09.539

13:11.333 --> 13:14.419
You're gonna leave this world...

Well, Miss Fosli can't leave yet.

13:57.254 --> 14:01.675

I'm afraid.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.352
[ Groaning ]

14:20.861 --> 14:24.030
So... is there a letter?

14:24.114 --> 14:26.074
No.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.660
Of course there isn't.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.788
- Kaya.
- Yes?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.333
Come over here.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.836
Tell me what you want.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.798
Are you the one I should thank
for this situation?

14:42.591 --> 14:44.301
Please, you mustn't -

14:44.384 --> 14:49.514
I mean, you're terribly eager
to be married, it seems.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.476
Well...

14:54.019 --> 14:59.065
Ragnar and I have been engaged
for four or five years.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.650
Yes?

15:00.734 --> 15:03.612
He and his father keep talking about it...

15:03.695 --> 15:06.698
and I suppose eventually
I'll have to give in.

15:06.781 --> 15:10.952
And of course,
you have a certain affection for Ragnar?

15:12.412 --> 15:16.416
I used to have a great deal
of affection for him...

15:16.499 --> 15:19.544
before I came to work for you.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.923
But you don't anymore?

15:23.006 --> 15:27.010
I only care about one person - one.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.763
I don't care about anybody else.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.681
And I never will.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.558
Well, you say that...

15:33.642 --> 15:38.355
but then at the same time, you seem to be
making plans to leave me, aren't you?

15:39.105 --> 15:41.900
But couldn't I still work here even if I -

15:41.983 --> 15:44.236
No. No!

15:44.319 --> 15:46.154
It can't happen that way.

15:46.238 --> 15:49.574
If Ragnar goes off
and he sets up on his own...

15:49.658 --> 15:52.202
he's going to need you himself,
don't you see that?

15:52.285 --> 15:55.622
Well, I don't think I can
be separated from you.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.207
It's impossible. I just -

15:57.290 --> 16:00.835
Can't you just convince him to stay here?

16:02.879 --> 16:05.215
He has a good position here.

16:08.677 --> 16:13.098
And that's the only way
I'm gonna be able to -

16:13.181 --> 16:15.433
to keep you with me, Kaya.

16:15.517 --> 16:18.645
- [ Groans ]

16:18.728 --> 16:21.439
It would be so wonderful
if it could work out like that.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.361
I can't not have you.

No, no, no.

Miss Fosli just has
a short letter to write, and then she's -

Did you need me for something, Aline?

Must be a really good thing for you to
have found that young woman, Halvard.

Oh, yes,
she's just so useful in so many ways.

Oh, yes, she seems as if she would be.

19:13.736 --> 19:16.489
And she's, uh, good at bookkeeping?

19:16.573 --> 19:21.327
Well, she's had an awful lot of practice
at bookkeeping in the last two years.

The other thing is,
she's such a kind person.

19:24.581 --> 19:28.126
She's ready to do whatever comes up
that needs to be done.

Well, it does, it does.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.427
It does.

since I've had anyone here...

I'll come right back.

Thank you.

Now, look.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.725
I know you know Aline better
than anyone.

20:27.101 --> 20:30.647
She's said to me many times
you're her only friend.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.651
So, can I ask you...

20:34.734 --> 20:39.739
did you notice anything
in particular about her just now...

20:39.822 --> 20:41.658
in relation to me?

20:42.617 --> 20:45.662
Well, yes, for God's sake.

20:45.745 --> 20:49.582
I mean - I mean, one could hardly help
noticing that she, uh -

20:49.666 --> 20:51.709
- Yes?
- Well -

20:51.793 --> 20:54.254
She doesn't seem to be terribly fond
of that Miss Fosli of yours.

20:54.337 --> 20:57.215
- Well -
- I mean, it's not that surprising...

20:57.298 --> 20:59.425
that she doesn't particularly
like the fact...

20:59.509 --> 21:02.720
that you spend every single day
in the company of another woman.

21:02.804 --> 21:06.849
Well, but that happens
to be something that can't be changed.

21:07.892 --> 21:10.061
Well, why not?
Couldn't you find a male secretary?

21:10.144 --> 21:12.355
- Oh!
- No, I mean...

21:12.438 --> 21:14.274

21:14.357 --> 21:16.693
In other words,
she's a very fragile woman...

21:16.776 --> 21:21.364
and it's something, you know,
that she really can't bear -

21:21.447 --> 21:23.074
I mean, to look at this young girl -

21:23.157 --> 21:26.786
Oh, for God's sakes. So what? Who cares?

21:28.705 --> 21:31.791
Well, I mean I do, in a way.
I do, obviously.

21:31.874 --> 21:35.587
But... the situation is what it is.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.630
You mean there's no alternative?

21:37.714 --> 21:40.466
That's right. There's no alternative.

21:40.550 --> 21:46.306
Of course, women's perceptions are often
infuriatingly accurate on certain topics.

21:46.389 --> 21:47.890
Yes?

21:47.974 --> 21:50.810
And so when your wife happens to find...

that she just can't stand
that Kaya Fosli...

21:54.063 --> 21:58.318
don't you think that maybe
there's some sort of a basis...

21:58.401 --> 22:01.195
for that sort of...

22:01.279 --> 22:04.449
involuntary reflex of antipathy?

22:05.325 --> 22:07.827
No, no, not at all.

22:07.910 --> 22:11.956
I see. There's just no basis for
your wife's feeling at all, in other words.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.959
Only her own suspiciousness, I suppose.

Very well then.

I'm sure you remember...

23:01.547 --> 23:05.009
that many years ago,
I brought both Knut Brovik and his son...

23:05.093 --> 23:07.595
over to work for me at a time...

23:07.679 --> 23:10.973

for the old man.

At a certain point...

23:14.977 --> 23:17.355
a few years after that...

23:17.438 --> 23:21.859
Ragnar suddenly came up with the idea
of getting married...

23:21.943 --> 23:26.239
and leaving my office
to go set up an office of his own.

23:27.699 --> 23:31.411
But I needed Ragnar
to stay here with me...

23:31.494 --> 23:35.123
because Ragnar happens
to be extremely clever...

23:35.206 --> 23:39.168
about calculating, you know,
the volume of things...

23:39.252 --> 23:41.254
the carrying capacity...

23:41.337 --> 23:43.548
and all that sort of tedious detail.

Well, it's an important part
of your business, yes.

23:46.801 --> 23:49.846
Now listen to what I'm trying to tell you.

23:50.555 --> 23:55.935
One day, a young woman
whom I'd never seen before...

23:56.018 --> 23:59.605
came over to the office to see Ragnar...

23:59.689 --> 24:03.776
and this turned out
to be Ragnar's fiancée...

24:03.860 --> 24:05.611

24:05.695 --> 24:10.324
When I saw how incredibly infatuated
with each other...

24:10.408 --> 24:12.118
she and Ragnar were...

24:12.201 --> 24:13.786

24:13.870 --> 24:17.623
if I could get this young girl
to come work here in the office...

24:17.707 --> 24:19.375
then maybe Ragnar would stay here too.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.960

24:21.043 --> 24:24.338
So I just stood there staring at her...

wishing I could think
of how to convince her to work here.

24:28.050 --> 24:31.429
Then we were introduced,
but we had no conversation of any kind.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.723
And then she went away.

24:33.806 --> 24:39.437
Well, the next night,
after Ragnar and Brovik had gone home...

24:39.520 --> 24:42.398
she came back here...

24:42.482 --> 24:46.652
and just as if I'd already made
an arrangement with her...

24:46.736 --> 24:51.991
she asked me what
her new responsibilities would be...

24:52.074 --> 24:55.578
and whether she could
start work immediately the next morning.

24:55.661 --> 24:58.372
But I never asked her to work here.

24:58.456 --> 25:00.124
My goodness!

25:00.208 --> 25:02.168
And then as soon as she
started working for me...

25:02.251 --> 25:04.420
she seemed to drift away from Ragnar -

25:04.504 --> 25:08.174
And drifted over towards you perhaps?

25:08.257 --> 25:11.761
I mean, I know she can actually feel it...

25:11.844 --> 25:15.723
if I look at her from behind.

25:15.807 --> 25:17.850
And if I come anywhere near her...

25:17.934 --> 25:21.938
she starts to shake,
she literally trembles.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.690
How can you account for that?

25:24.774 --> 25:29.153
Well, I'm sure there's a scientific
explanation for it out there somewhere.

- No.

I had said these things to her...

25:39.455 --> 25:41.541
which, in fact, I'd only thought?

inside my head to myself.

29:47.703 --> 29:50.748
Well, yes, for Aline,
it must have been a very sorrowful event.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.374
Very painful, I'm sure.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.919
Oh, she's never gotten over it.

29:55.002 --> 29:57.963
It's been years and years...

29:58.047 --> 30:00.216
and she still hasn't recovered from it.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.718
And what happened afterwards was terrible.

30:04.428 --> 30:06.222
Yes.

30:06.305 --> 30:09.975
But... that fire, really...

30:10.059 --> 30:11.685
was good luck for you.

30:11.769 --> 30:16.273
I mean, that fire actually made everything
possible, didn't it, really?

30:16.357 --> 30:19.360
You were just a poor boy from the country.

30:19.443 --> 30:23.656
And now you are absolutely
the leading man in your field.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.241
You are.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.826
I know.

30:26.909 --> 30:29.036
And that's exactly what's kept me...

30:29.120 --> 30:33.124
in such an awful state
of uninterrupted anxiety.

30:33.207 --> 30:36.043
Anxiety? Because you've had good luck?

30:36.127 --> 30:37.628
Yes!

It starts every morning when I get up...

'Cause I know that my luck
is going to turn around.

Everything is gonna spin out
in the opposite direction.

30:52.226 --> 30:55.688

What would make that happen?

30:57.982 --> 31:00.317
Well...

31:00.401 --> 31:04.780
those who are younger
will begin the process.

I know that.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.993
No. I have to say, I think that's absurd.

31:09.076 --> 31:12.329
No. One or another
of those younger people...

31:12.413 --> 31:16.333
is gonna ask me to step aside...

31:16.417 --> 31:19.170
and that will be that.

Hello.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.058
[ Laughing ]

33:00.521 --> 33:04.066
- I almost thought you didn't recognize me.
- Oh, no, no.

33:04.984 --> 33:07.486
Although I have to say
that just at the moment -

33:07.569 --> 33:09.071
Well, I certainly recognize you.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.991
- Oh, it's you!
- Yes, it's me.

33:12.074 --> 33:15.744
Yes, we met this summer up
at one of those hostels in the mountains.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.997
I've always wondered
where that whole group of ladies went.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.331
What happened to them?

33:20.791 --> 33:24.586
Oh, they all left the hotel
for some unknown reason.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.798
They probably weren't crazy about listening
to us having so much fun in the evenings.

33:27.881 --> 33:30.843
No, they certainly weren't.

33:30.926 --> 33:35.848
Now, you - you have to admit that you were
just toying with all of us, weren't you?

33:35.931 --> 33:38.934
That's right. You were just playing games
with all of us.

33:39.018 --> 33:41.812
Well, it was certainly more fun...

33:41.895 --> 33:45.566
than sitting with those ladies
and knitting winter stockings.

33:45.649 --> 33:48.152
I understand. I understand.

33:48.235 --> 33:51.780
So now, uh - now, let me guess.
[ Chuckling ]

33:51.864 --> 33:56.618
Have you possibly
just arrived in town this evening?

33:56.702 --> 34:00.205
I've just arrived this moment,
as a matter of fact.

34:00.289 --> 34:02.708
And did you come entirely alone,
Miss Wangel?

34:02.791 --> 34:05.002
Yes, I certainly did.

34:05.085 --> 34:07.463
Wangel? Your name is Wangel?

34:07.546 --> 34:09.922
I believe it is, if I'm not wrong.

But... could you possibly
be the daughter...

34:13.719 --> 34:17.222
of the district doctor up at Sangerly?

34:17.306 --> 34:19.641
Who else's daughter could I be?

34:19.725 --> 34:21.518
Then we met each other up there...

34:21.601 --> 34:23.478
the summer when I was staying there...

34:23.562 --> 34:27.440
and I built the tower for the old church.

34:27.524 --> 34:29.025
Yes.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.237
That was when we met.

34:32.321 --> 34:34.656
Well, that was a long time ago.

34:36.367 --> 34:38.118
It was 10 years ago.

34:38.202 --> 34:43.123
Ten years ago! You would have been
just a child, I imagine.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.585
Well, I was 12 years old.

[ Herdal ] Is this the first time you've
ever been to our town, Miss Wangel?

34:50.589 --> 34:54.259

at that spa together for a few days.

35:04.686 --> 35:07.106
- Up there!
- Yes.

if I came to town.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.278
[ Laughing ]

35:13.362 --> 35:17.741
Sort of a superfluous invitation,
wasn't it?

35:17.825 --> 35:21.370
Well, she certainly never mentioned
anything of the sort to me.

35:22.663 --> 35:26.041
Well, I'm going to ask if I might be
allowed to stay here tonight.

35:26.125 --> 35:30.504
Well, I think that could be arranged.

but it's absolutely filthy.

about that as well.

and then -

to come in here, please?

whom you know, apparently.

36:13.964 --> 36:17.217
So... you did come to visit
our town after all.

Yes. Miss Wangel has just
this very moment arrived in town...

to stay here overnight.

herself organized a bit and -

satisfied with my husband's company...

while I see about getting a room...

of space up there.

and get some proper clothes for yourself.

that you might like to come
and study here in our town?

41:27.944 --> 41:31.364

No, I'm not aware
that I am forgetful. No.

41:53.929 --> 41:58.433
Are you really not going to speak to me
at all about what happened up there?

41:58.517 --> 42:00.769
Up there at Sangerly?

42:00.852 --> 42:04.439
Well, there isn't really very much
to say about it, is there?

42:05.190 --> 42:07.526
Why are you talking like this?

42:07.609 --> 42:10.946
Well, tell me what you're referring to.

42:27.087 --> 42:30.757
When the tower on the old church
was completed...

42:30.841 --> 42:32.717
we had a big celebration in town.

42:32.801 --> 42:35.512
Oh, I haven't forgotten that.

No? Well, that's so nice
of you to say that.

42:42.894 --> 42:45.063
So, there was music in the churchyard...

42:45.146 --> 42:46.898
and many, many hundreds of people.

42:46.982 --> 42:50.235
And all of us girls from the school
were dressed in white...

42:50.318 --> 42:52.070
and we all had little flags.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.406
Yes, I remember those flags!

42:54.489 --> 42:58.493
And you started to climb the tower
right up the scaffolding...

42:58.577 --> 43:01.246
all the way up to the very highest point.

43:01.329 --> 43:03.748
And as you climbed,
you carried this enormous wreath.

43:03.832 --> 43:06.585
And you hung that wreath
all the way up on the weather vane.

43:06.668 --> 43:08.753
Oh, yes, yes,
I used to do that at that time...

43:08.837 --> 43:11.423
because that's a very
old custom, you know -

43:11.506 --> 43:13.425
the "Ceremony of the Wreath."

43:13.508 --> 43:17.095
It was so incredibly
suspenseful and exciting...

what if he were to fall?

Yes, well, yes, that could
have happened, actually.

of those little angels in white...

little evil devils...

"Bravo, Master Builder!" Yes!

around so wildly...

could just stand there on top of it...

the slightest bit dizzy.

how well you've managed...

all these meaningless details.

"meaningless detail"...

I was there, completely alone?

Were you?

I don't think you called me
an evil devil then.

I'm sure you did look like
a princess, Miss Wangel.

I would be your princess.

- I did?
- [ Laughing ] Yeah.

I'd have to wait before you came back...

you said you would return in 10 years...

46:01.468 --> 46:05.096

half-human mountain creature...

you would kidnap me...

of buying anything cheap.

Yes, you did.

You also said what my kingdom
would be called.

you were trying to make fun of me.

56:02.276 --> 56:04.862
No, I didn't. But in any case...

56:04.945 --> 56:08.532
now... I quite like the sound
of "Princess Hilde."

56:08.616 --> 56:11.327
- [ Laughing ]
- Exactly.

56:13.621 --> 56:15.164
Oh, Hilde.

56:15.247 --> 56:21.128
It is so good for me that you came here
at this particular moment.

56:21.212 --> 56:23.964
It is? Really?

56:24.048 --> 56:26.300
Because I have been
sitting here in this house...

56:26.384 --> 56:29.720
with a feeling
of being completely alone...

56:29.804 --> 56:35.393
and just sort of staring helplessly
at absolutely everything.

56:35.476 --> 56:37.103
And you know, the funny thing is...

56:37.186 --> 56:41.232
that I've become so disturbed
by younger people.

56:41.315 --> 56:43.734
What?

56:43.818 --> 56:45.736
Younger people?

56:45.820 --> 56:47.822
They upset me so much...

56:48.656 --> 56:51.951
that I've sort of closed my door here
and locked myself in.

56:52.034 --> 56:55.121
I mean, I'm afraid that
they're gonna come here...

56:55.204 --> 56:57.373
and they're gonna knock on the door...

56:57.456 --> 56:59.166
and then they're going to break in.

57:01.001 --> 57:06.173
Well, I think you
should just open the door and let them in.

57:09.510 --> 57:11.512
- Open the door?
- Yes.

57:12.096 --> 57:13.597
Yes.

57:13.681 --> 57:20.146
So that they can gently
and quietly come inside...

57:20.229 --> 57:23.441
and it can be something good for you.

57:23.524 --> 57:27.111
- Open the door?
- Can you?

57:27.194 --> 57:31.782
Master Builder,
can you in some way make use of me?

[ Knocking ]

57:33.492 --> 57:36.662
Well, are you two still talking?

57:36.746 --> 57:40.458
Well, you know,
we found quite a bit to talk about.

57:40.541 --> 57:43.961
Yes, it's been wonderfully interesting
because Master Builder Solness...

57:44.044 --> 57:46.088
has such an absolutely incredible memory.

57:46.172 --> 57:50.092
He instantly recalls even
the most meaningless details.

[ Both Laughing ]

57:53.220 --> 57:56.682
Your room is all ready for you,
Miss Wangel.

57:57.933 --> 58:01.061
Oh, one of the children's rooms?

58:01.729 --> 58:03.647
Yes, the middle one, but, um -

58:03.731 --> 58:07.777
So... Hilde will sleep
in one of the children's rooms.

58:07.860 --> 58:09.653
Hilde?

58:09.737 --> 58:14.700
Yes, Miss Wangel is called Hilde.

58:14.784 --> 58:16.410
And do you know...

58:16.494 --> 58:20.164
I knew Hilde when she was a child.

58:20.247 --> 58:23.626
You did? Well, Halvard, really?

[ Knocking ]

59:00.037 --> 59:01.539
Hello.

I just wanted to tell you that I'm here.

59:07.920 --> 59:10.047
Good. Good.

How's old Brovik doing today?

59:15.302 --> 59:17.137
Not very well.

59:17.221 --> 59:19.807
He wanted me to tell you
that he's terribly sorry...

59:19.890 --> 59:21.892
but he has to spend the day in bed.

59:21.976 --> 59:24.812
Oh, of course. He must stay in bed.

59:26.438 --> 59:29.400
Well, you can get to work, if you like.

Old Brovik.

He's certainly going to die.

We'll be hearing about his death
any day now, I'd say.

Do you think maybe you should
go out for a while...

- and take a little walk or something?
- [ Sighs ]

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:13.110
Yes, absolutely.

That's exactly the thing I need to do.

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:29.376
Is she still asleep?

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.378
You're wondering about Miss Wangel?

01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:33.380
Yes, I just suddenly wondered -

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:35.424
Actually, she's been up for hours.

- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

When I went in to look in on her...

she was busy arranging
all of her little things.

for one of the children's rooms...

Yes, at last.

to not just leave all of them empty.

You're quite right, Halvard.

Hmm?

01:01:27.226 --> 01:01:29.603
No, I was talking about the fact...

01:01:29.687 --> 01:01:33.941
that we're gonna move into our new house.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:35.859
Do you believe that, Halvard?

Do you really believe
that's gonna make things better?

01:01:38.946 --> 01:01:40.990
I don't doubt it for a second.

01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:45.369
No.

Because when I think
about the new house, I go blank.

You know it's very hard for me
when you say things like that, Aline...

you're the main reason -

- I built it for you.
- Yes, for me.

- "Nice for me."

because there's going
to be so much there...

Attention? Really?

01:07:38.138 --> 01:07:40.390
Well, that would be fun, wouldn't it?

01:07:40.474 --> 01:07:42.893
Mmm, but then...

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:46.563
people there might start to think
that you, too, were crazy.

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:48.357
Crazy? Why?

Is there an enormous number
of crazy people here in your town?

Do you mean
that you haven't noticed it yet?

No. No. Absolutely not.

Maybe in - in one particular way.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.389
Whoa.
Did you hear that, Aline?

01:08:20.471 --> 01:08:22.557
Yeah? Well, what is
that one particular way?

- Come on. Tell us.
- No. Do you think I'm crazy?

I'm sure when you two are alone,
she'll tell you, Halvard.

- Really? Do you think so?
- Yes, I do.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:36.321
[ Aline ] Because you knew her
so well at one time...

01:08:36.404 --> 01:08:38.657
when she was a child.

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:42.077
I believe you told me.

is your wife just incapable
of liking me at all?

01:09:07.394 --> 01:09:08.895
I'm sorry. I -

01:09:08.979 --> 01:09:10.564

In these last few years...

01:09:16.278 --> 01:09:20.532
Aline has become very reclusive...

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.036
Yes.

If only you could
get to know her a little.

She's actually...

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:34.337
a kind, good, wonderful person.

If she's so kind...

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.343
why did she talk that way
about obligation?

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:42.761
Obligation?

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.264
Yes.

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:47.350
She said she would
go buy me some things out of obligation.

01:09:47.434 --> 01:09:52.104
Christ, I hate that word.
It's so revolting, so ugly.

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:53.899
"Obligation"?

01:09:53.982 --> 01:09:56.693
I mean, if she really is
so kind as you say she is...

01:09:56.776 --> 01:09:58.862
why would she use a word like that?

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:03.533
But what sort of words
do you think that she should have used?

01:10:03.617 --> 01:10:06.912
Well, she might have said that she wanted
to go buy me some things...

01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:10.457
because she liked me very much
and she wanted to do it.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.459
That's what she could have said.

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.045
Something warm, from her heart.

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:22.135
That's what you hoped
that Aline would say?

01:10:24.346 --> 01:10:26.389
Are you the one
who's done all these drawings?

01:10:26.473 --> 01:10:27.807
No!

01:10:29.184 --> 01:10:30.977
They were done by...

01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:33.563
a young man whom I have here
assisting me.

Oh.

- Yes.

tell that from looking at those drawings?

No.

- Well -
- I think it's absurd.

the things that you know.

Um, two little boys. Twins.

01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:16.291

where you can see the new house...

01:13:27.237 --> 01:13:31.157
well, that was where Aline and I had lived
when we were first married.

01:13:32.409 --> 01:13:34.994
Because at that time,
there was an old house there...

01:13:35.078 --> 01:13:38.206
that had belonged to her mother and -

01:13:38.289 --> 01:13:40.417
That house had been given to us...

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.545
along with this whole,
enormous garden around it.

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.922
Did that house also have a tower?

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:48.174
- [ Laughing ] Oh, no.
- [ Laughs ]

01:13:48.258 --> 01:13:49.759
Nothing like that.

01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:52.637
On the contrary, from the outside...

01:13:52.721 --> 01:13:56.599
that house was actually, uh...

01:13:56.683 --> 01:14:01.479
just a huge, dark, depressing, ugly box.

01:14:01.563 --> 01:14:05.191
But inside, though, it was actually
very comfortable and cozy and -

01:14:05.275 --> 01:14:07.610
and... that was where we lived...

01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:10.613
when the two little boys were born.

01:14:10.697 --> 01:14:13.324
When they first came into the world...

01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:16.202
they were so healthy and strong.

01:14:16.286 --> 01:14:19.581
They were growing every day.
You could actually see it.

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:22.917
Yes, they grow so fast
in the first few days.

01:14:23.001 --> 01:14:27.297
And the sight of Aline,
lying in bed with the two little babies...

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:31.050
that was the most beautiful sight
you could ever see in your life.

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:35.180
But then one night, we had a fire.

01:14:35.263 --> 01:14:37.474
A fire?

01:14:37.557 --> 01:14:39.809
What happened?

01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:42.228
Well, that was a terrible night.

01:14:43.438 --> 01:14:46.483
Alarms. Chaos.

01:14:46.566 --> 01:14:49.319
Everybody scrambling and pushing...

01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:52.781
outside at night in the freezing cold.

01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:56.326
Aline and the boys
carried out in their beds.

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:58.286
Well, Aline...

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:02.081
went into a state of sheer terror...

01:15:02.916 --> 01:15:06.169
and as a result she developed a fever.

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:09.047
And that, in turn, affected her milk.

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:13.510
And she insisted that she had
to nurse the little babies herself...

01:15:13.593 --> 01:15:15.094
no matter how ill she was.

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:18.765
She said that was her obligation.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:22.602
So both of the little boys got sick...

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:24.979
and they both died.

01:15:25.772 --> 01:15:27.649
They couldn't survive drinking the milk?

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:29.609
No, that's right.

01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:33.696
That must have been so hard for you...

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.323
so painful.

01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:36.825
Yes.

01:15:36.908 --> 01:15:40.161
It was 10 times worse for Aline.

01:15:40.245 --> 01:15:42.747
I mean, can you believe this...

01:15:42.831 --> 01:15:46.543
that things like that
are allowed to happen in the world?

01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:52.006
From the day I lost my boys,
I hated building churches.

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:55.009
And now I don't build
anything like that anymore.

01:15:55.093 --> 01:15:57.303
Only homes, where people can live.

01:15:57.387 --> 01:15:59.389
Homes for people.

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:01.975
Homes with high towers
and spires though.

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:06.312
Yes. I must admit
I do prefer them that way.

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:09.232
Anyway -

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:12.694
See, that fire lifted me up
to a great height...

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:15.321
as a master builder...

01:16:15.405 --> 01:16:19.075
because, see, I parceled out almost
that whole piece of land...

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:21.411
into lots for houses...

01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:24.747
and of course I was the one
who was able to build the houses.

01:16:24.831 --> 01:16:28.501
And after that,
everything started going in my direction.

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:33.256
You must be a very happy man,
the way it's all gone for you.

01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:37.594
[ Scoffs ] Now you're saying that too,
like everybody else.

01:16:37.677 --> 01:16:39.596
Well, you must be.

01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:41.264
I think that you must be...

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:45.268
if only you could manage
to stop thinking all the time...

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:46.811
about those two little children -

01:16:46.895 --> 01:16:49.188
- Well, Hilde -
- I mean, do they still...

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:51.816
stand in the way
of everything all the time...

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.443
after all these years?

01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:57.322
But don't you see that in order
to get that opportunity...

01:16:57.405 --> 01:16:59.157
to build homes for other people...

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.076
I had to give up forever
any hope at all...

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.913
of having a home myself?

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:10.293
I mean, a home with a mother
and a father and children.

01:17:13.171 --> 01:17:15.131
You mean, because -

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:16.883
That was the price I had to pay...

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:21.304
for all this wonderful good fortune
that people love to talk about.

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:24.140
And yet...

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:26.267
you're building a home...

01:17:26.351 --> 01:17:28.686
with rooms for children.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.025
Hilde.

01:17:35.485 --> 01:17:37.153
Have you ever noticed...

01:17:38.655 --> 01:17:42.450
that sometimes the thing
which is impossible...

01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:46.496
can somehow still tempt you...

01:17:46.579 --> 01:17:48.915
can somehow still cry out to you?

01:17:49.916 --> 01:17:51.834
So you know about that too, do you?

01:17:51.918 --> 01:17:54.170
- [ Laughing ]
- Yes, Hilde, I do.

01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:56.422
Well, it sounds like there might be...

01:17:56.506 --> 01:17:59.425
some weird, half-human
mountain creature...

01:17:59.509 --> 01:18:02.428
just running around somewhere inside you.

01:18:02.512 --> 01:18:04.847
[ Chuckles ]
Yes, maybe.

01:18:04.931 --> 01:18:09.936
But you see, there's always
a balancing that has to occur.

01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:14.732
In other words, everything I've done,
everything I've achieved...

01:18:14.816 --> 01:18:17.068
it all has to be balanced out.

And the currency...

in which the payment is demanded

And my good fortune, it can't be paid for
just with my happiness alone.

No, it also has to be paid for
with the happiness of other people.

Aline also had a great talent.

01:19:12.582 --> 01:19:16.252
She had a talent
for building and shaping...

01:23:43.477 --> 01:23:45.229

in the chimney pipe there.

And every time
that I would go up to the attic...

if the crack was still there.

as if a hand had suddenly come out
of nowhere and was holding on to me...

01:24:26.854 --> 01:24:29.732
and I would just say to myself,
"Well, I'll do it tomorrow."

about that little crack.

Could I possibly fly through that crack...

It seemed so simple and easy.

01:25:09.522 --> 01:25:13.442

in the wintertime, a little before lunch...

Would you agree with me, possibly...

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.622

accomplish things like that...

entirely on their own.

01:27:23.447 --> 01:27:27.284

And in order for one's desires
to be realized...

01:27:34.917 --> 01:27:37.545
those forces have to be there.

01:27:37.628 --> 01:27:39.338
They don't just suddenly appear, Hilde.

01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:41.340

01:28:03.404 --> 01:28:07.366
if perhaps you were simply born...

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:11.870
with an oversensitive conscience.

01:28:12.997 --> 01:28:14.623
Wh-What does that mean?

01:28:14.707 --> 01:28:19.420
It means that your conscience
is very delicate...

01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:21.213
and it's much too weak...

01:28:21.297 --> 01:28:24.133
and it is too easily crushed
by heavy things.

01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:27.553
I see. And what sort of a conscience
should I have then?

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:31.015
I would like you to have
a more robust conscience...

01:28:31.098 --> 01:28:35.185

and bear their weight.

Oh, yes, certainly.

Well, they always talk about the Vikings.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:29:00.586
They always describe how the Vikings went
to foreign countries and...

01:29:01.712 --> 01:29:04.131
they set fire to the countryside...

01:29:04.214 --> 01:29:08.302
and they robbed, and they stole,
and they beat men to death.

01:29:08.385 --> 01:29:10.804
- They seized the women.
- They just took them away.

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:19.438

those consciences that were s -

01:29:19.521 --> 01:29:22.483
that were strong and robust.

01:29:24.943 --> 01:29:28.197

of those stories...

some of those women
whom they carried off...

01:29:30.658 --> 01:29:35.454

that they refused to be parted from them.

Does that make any sort
of sense to you, Hilde?

It makes complete sense to me.

So you could make
that same sort of a choice yourself then?

Why wouldn't I?

to move in and live...

and hide in the shrubbery.

You are like a day
which is dawning, Hilde.

just a moment of happiness...

Even if you don't
really like the drawings...

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:31.904

to lie a little.

Now you're asking me to lie?

And if you do, write some really nice things
on the young man's drawings...

to get the job of building the house.

Maybe for his old father's sake
I could do something like that...

because at one point in the past,
Hilde, when I was rising up...

I pulled that old man down,
I destroyed him.

houses for people
that I don't even know...

01:41:54.984 --> 01:41:57.112
and these strangers, you see...

01:41:57.195 --> 01:42:00.281
can sit in their windows and stare at me.

01:42:00.365 --> 01:42:03.159
I mean, isn't that something?

[ Dog Barking ]

01:42:10.834 --> 01:42:12.710
Mrs. Solness?

01:42:13.711 --> 01:42:17.132
Would it be all right
if I sat with you here for a short while?

01:42:19.467 --> 01:42:23.221
It would be very nice
if you feel you'd like to.

01:42:37.402 --> 01:42:39.154
Ah.

01:42:40.947 --> 01:42:44.200
A perfect spot to just sit
and sun yourself like a cat.

01:42:47.162 --> 01:42:49.372
It's so kind of you
to want to sit with me.

01:42:49.456 --> 01:42:52.500
I thought you'd be going in
to be with my husband now.

What would you think
I'd be doing with him?

01:42:55.003 --> 01:42:57.964
- Helping him, I suppose.
- No. Please.

Anyway, he isn't in there.

01:43:00.508 --> 01:43:02.844
He's gone over to see the men
who are working on the new house.

01:43:02.927 --> 01:43:04.262
Oh.

01:43:04.345 --> 01:43:07.849
The expression he had on his face,
he looked so fierce and dangerous...

01:43:07.932 --> 01:43:10.685
I really didn't have
the courage to speak to him.

01:43:10.768 --> 01:43:12.687
- [ Laughs ]
- Is that so?

01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:15.273
But did you know that
my husband really has...

01:43:15.356 --> 01:43:18.610
the most gentle disposition in the world?

01:43:19.694 --> 01:43:21.529
- He does?
- Mm-hmm.

01:43:21.613 --> 01:43:24.782
You see, you don't know him
properly yet, Miss Wangel.

01:43:37.837 --> 01:43:41.799
So are you happy to be moving over
into the new house?

01:43:41.883 --> 01:43:46.346
I ought to be because he so much
wants me to be happy about it.

01:43:46.429 --> 01:43:48.848
I'm sure that's not
the only reason to be happy, is it?

01:43:48.932 --> 01:43:50.558
Oh, yes, it is, yes.

01:43:50.642 --> 01:43:55.563
That's my simple obligation
in life, Miss Wangel - to do what he wants.

01:43:55.647 --> 01:43:57.565
Simply to yield.

01:43:57.649 --> 01:44:00.360
But there are many occasions
when it's terribly hard...

01:44:00.443 --> 01:44:04.155
to beat one's spirit
into the necessary submission.

01:44:04.239 --> 01:44:07.242
Um, yes, uh, that must be hard.

01:44:07.325 --> 01:44:11.746
Yes, it is hard, if one isn't
a better person than I am, at any rate.

Mrs. Solness...

01:44:13.665 --> 01:44:18.461
I mean, when someone has been through
really hard times the way that you have -

01:44:18.545 --> 01:44:21.339
How do you know
I've been through hard times?

01:44:22.090 --> 01:44:24.842
- Your husband said that you had.
- Oh.

He says so little about those things
to me. But yes, it's true.

I've been through quite a bit
in the course of my life, yes, I have.

01:44:34.227 --> 01:44:37.522
Dear Mrs. Solness,
first everything burned up in the fire.

Yes, everything I had.

01:44:39.691 --> 01:44:41.401
And then...

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:43.903
so much worse.

01:44:43.987 --> 01:44:45.613

Worse?

losing the boys.

01:44:56.374 --> 01:44:59.043
Oh. That.

01:44:59.669 --> 01:45:01.212
Well...

01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:06.634
that was sort of a -
a decision by a higher power...

01:45:06.718 --> 01:45:09.804
and one has to submit oneself
to something like that...

01:45:09.887 --> 01:45:12.515
and - and even give thanks for it.

01:45:13.558 --> 01:45:15.810
- Do you do that?
- Not always, I'm afraid.

01:45:15.893 --> 01:45:19.272
But I know that that's my obligation.

01:45:19.355 --> 01:45:21.566
That's what I ought to do.

01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:24.819
But, um, sometimes I just can't.

01:45:24.902 --> 01:45:26.863
I think that's so understandable.

01:45:26.946 --> 01:45:31.701
Again, I have to say to myself,
it was a just punishment.

01:45:32.493 --> 01:45:34.495
I don't understand.

01:45:34.579 --> 01:45:37.081
Quite honestly, Miss Wangel,
please, please stop talking...

01:45:37.165 --> 01:45:39.042
about the two little boys.

01:45:39.125 --> 01:45:41.961
We should only be happy for them now...

01:45:42.045 --> 01:45:45.006
because things are so good for them.

01:45:45.089 --> 01:45:46.674
Very, very good.

might consider almost worthless.

- Yes, every one of them.

you had as a young girl?

this whole thing -

01:53:22.713 --> 01:53:24.799
this whole thing could -

01:53:34.225 --> 01:53:36.894
I know what you're going
to build next, Master Builder.

01:53:36.977 --> 01:53:39.647
Really? What?

01:53:41.732 --> 01:53:44.568
It's going to be a palace.

01:53:45.444 --> 01:53:48.114
Tell me how you've imagined it, Hilde.

01:53:48.197 --> 01:53:52.284
My palace will stand
very, very high up on a hill...

01:53:52.368 --> 01:53:54.328
with nothing around it on any side...

01:53:54.411 --> 01:53:59.125
so that I can see far, far off,
way out over the land.

01:54:00.876 --> 01:54:03.587
And I'm sure there will be
a high tower on it.

01:54:03.671 --> 01:54:05.798
Yes. Oh, yes.

01:54:05.881 --> 01:54:09.051
The tower, you see,
will be frightfully high up.

01:54:09.135 --> 01:54:11.679
And way, way up at the top of the tower...

01:54:11.762 --> 01:54:16.100
yes, a balcony will be there
encircling the whole thing.

01:54:16.183 --> 01:54:20.437
And outside on the balcony,
that's where I'll stand.

01:54:20.521 --> 01:54:23.774
Oh, my God.
That you would stand up there...

01:54:23.858 --> 01:54:25.693
so horribly high up...

01:54:25.776 --> 01:54:28.154
so dizzyingly high up.

01:54:28.237 --> 01:54:33.200
That's where I'll stand, and of course,
you'll be able to come up also.

01:54:33.284 --> 01:54:37.371
The master builder will be permitted
to come up to the princess?

01:54:37.454 --> 01:54:39.623
Yes, of course.

01:54:41.125 --> 01:54:44.712
But maybe he won't be able
to build anymore, poor Master Builder.

01:54:44.795 --> 01:54:47.506
No. He will build.

01:54:47.590 --> 01:54:49.717
Because, you see...

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:52.511
you and I are going to be partners now.

01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:56.223
But what are we gonna build, Hilde?

01:55:05.733 --> 01:55:07.234
Excuse me.

01:55:09.278 --> 01:55:11.155
Look!

01:55:11.238 --> 01:55:14.074
It's going to be so incredibly beautiful.

01:55:14.158 --> 01:55:17.244
Uh, what are you doing here?

01:55:17.328 --> 01:55:21.373
Well, I promised the foreman
I'd bring the wreath.

01:55:21.457 --> 01:55:23.500
Now?

01:55:24.335 --> 01:55:26.629
So, uh...

01:55:26.712 --> 01:55:29.298
is your father doing a bit better then?

01:55:30.507 --> 01:55:32.635
Mmm.

01:55:32.718 --> 01:55:34.720
Not really.

01:55:35.846 --> 01:55:39.516
But, um, did the things I wrote
cheer him up at all?

01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:42.853
No, they came too late, I'm sorry to say.

01:55:42.937 --> 01:55:44.772
Oh. You mean -

01:55:44.855 --> 01:55:49.401
When Kaya arrived, he was already in a coma.
He'd had a stroke actually.

01:55:49.485 --> 01:55:51.779
For God's sake,
go home and take care of him.

01:55:51.862 --> 01:55:55.074
- There's nothing more I can do for him now.
- Well, you ought to be with him.

01:55:55.157 --> 01:55:58.619
Well, she's with him.
She's sitting by the bed.

01:55:58.702 --> 01:56:02.122
- You mean Kaya?
- Yeah. Kaya.

01:56:03.832 --> 01:56:07.419
But, you see, I don't have
anything for you to do here.

01:56:07.503 --> 01:56:09.046
Yes, I know.

01:56:10.005 --> 01:56:12.091
But I'm staying for the ceremony.

01:56:13.384 --> 01:56:16.637
Oh. I see. Well, all right then.

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:21.016
I'll take this down to the men,
and I'll be back in a moment.

01:56:24.561 --> 01:56:27.606
I would have thought you might
have thanked him at least.

01:56:28.816 --> 01:56:30.651
Thanked him?
You think I should have thanked him?

01:56:30.734 --> 01:56:32.444
Yes, of course.

01:56:32.528 --> 01:56:34.905
You're probably the one
I should actually thank. Am I right?

01:56:34.989 --> 01:56:37.157
- What do you mean?
- [ Aline ] Where is he?

01:56:37.241 --> 01:56:39.326
He took the wreath to the men
who are working down there.

01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:40.953
He took the wreath?

01:56:41.036 --> 01:56:44.164
What if he gets it in his head
to go up that scaffolding?

01:56:44.248 --> 01:56:45.958
- I've got to stop him.
- [ Dr. Herdal ] I'm sorry.

01:56:46.041 --> 01:56:48.168
Some visitors need attending to
at the front door.

01:56:48.252 --> 01:56:50.004
- I can't.
- But the women have just arrived.

01:56:50.087 --> 01:56:51.755
- They've come to see you.
- They've come now?

01:56:51.839 --> 01:56:53.841
They've come to watch the ceremony.

01:56:53.924 --> 01:56:56.302
- Can't you just ask them to leave?
- No, it's impossible.

01:56:56.385 --> 01:57:00.848
They've come to my house.
It's certainly my obligation to look after them.

01:57:00.931 --> 01:57:05.811
But you can stay here,
and when he comes back just hold on to him.

01:57:05.894 --> 01:57:07.354
Don't let him go.

01:57:07.438 --> 01:57:10.691
There are so many things
I need to be doing right now.

01:57:10.774 --> 01:57:12.318
Excuse me.

01:57:12.401 --> 01:57:14.570
- Can we step in here for a minute?
- [ Women Chattering ]

01:57:15.446 --> 01:57:17.698
Look, I don't want to upset you.

01:57:17.781 --> 01:57:20.534
I just want to say I think
you ought to proceed with caution.

01:57:20.617 --> 01:57:23.162
Because I'd be very surprised
if you really know him yet.

01:57:23.245 --> 01:57:25.622
I know him better
than anyone in the world knows him.

01:57:25.706 --> 01:57:28.834
You think I should have thanked him.
Can I tell you something?

01:57:28.917 --> 01:57:33.047
This is the man who kept me
down at the lowest level, year after year.

01:57:33.130 --> 01:57:36.383
He ruined my father's life.
He made my father lose his respect for me.

01:57:36.467 --> 01:57:39.678
He made me lose whatever respect
I might once have had for myself.

01:57:39.762 --> 01:57:41.221
And this man is such a coward...

01:57:41.305 --> 01:57:43.390
he can't even climb the towers
he himself has designed...

01:57:43.474 --> 01:57:45.184
not even this one for his own house.

01:57:45.267 --> 01:57:48.854
I saw him climb up an enormous tower
and tie a wreath to a church's weather vane.

01:57:48.937 --> 01:57:51.106
- You saw him do that?
- He's going to do it again today.

01:57:51.190 --> 01:57:53.984
- We're all going to see it.
- Yes, but he won't. He can't.

01:57:54.068 --> 01:57:56.403
Maybe at one time he could,
but now he can't.

01:57:56.487 --> 01:57:58.197
There's something else
I have to tell you...

01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:00.657
- something I've just learned this afternoon.
- Is that right?

01:58:00.741 --> 01:58:02.951
Do you have any idea
why he did everything he could...

01:58:03.035 --> 01:58:05.245
to stop me from leaving this office?

01:58:05.329 --> 01:58:07.581
He didn't want me to leave
because if I left...

01:58:07.664 --> 01:58:10.250
he couldn't get his dirty hands
on my fiancée.

01:58:10.834 --> 01:58:12.628
That's not true. That's a lie.

01:58:12.711 --> 01:58:14.671
She told me herself this afternoon.

01:58:14.755 --> 01:58:16.715
She said he literally controls her soul.

01:58:16.799 --> 01:58:20.427
No, it's all about you. He had to keep you
from setting off on your own.

01:58:20.511 --> 01:58:22.888
Why?

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:29.103
Oh, my God.
It's what I've always thought.

01:58:29.186 --> 01:58:33.065
He knew I would be a good architect.
He was afraid of me.

01:58:33.148 --> 01:58:36.318
Well, everything is going
terribly well down there.

01:58:36.402 --> 01:58:39.780
The foreman, Mr. Tesman,
is going to take the wreath up the tower.

01:58:39.863 --> 01:58:41.615
It's all going to be fantastic.

01:58:41.698 --> 01:58:45.202
Yes, that Tesman really is
a courageous fellow.

01:58:46.245 --> 01:58:48.622
He's a man I admire.

01:58:49.206 --> 01:58:52.709
He's an honorable,
upstanding, decent man.

01:58:54.503 --> 01:58:56.964
What are you trying to say to us exactly?

01:58:57.047 --> 01:58:58.841
Just...

01:58:59.383 --> 01:59:01.552
Tesman is a man I respect.

01:59:13.063 --> 01:59:14.481
So -

01:59:14.565 --> 01:59:16.859
- What?
- It's true, isn't it?

01:59:19.194 --> 01:59:21.196
The bookkeeper?

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.865
Kaya?

01:59:28.245 --> 01:59:29.913
- What are you?
- <i>[Monitor Beeping]</i>

01:59:29.997 --> 01:59:32.082
<i>[Herdal]
Aline, I need that blue bottle!</i>

01:59:32.166 --> 01:59:34.376
<i>Solness. Solness!</i>

01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:36.879
Are you really afraid to climb the tower?

01:59:36.962 --> 01:59:39.047
Is that what you are,
you pathetic creature?

01:59:39.131 --> 01:59:41.633
If that's how you see me,
I can't bear that.

01:59:41.717 --> 01:59:44.428
Then let me see you differently.

01:59:44.511 --> 01:59:48.056
Let me see you up there on that tower,
high up and standing free.

01:59:48.140 --> 01:59:50.642
- No, I can't!
- That's what I want!

01:59:50.726 --> 01:59:54.354
- That is what I want.
- But I can't do that. I told you.

01:59:54.438 --> 01:59:56.815
This is the moment
everything is going to stop.

01:59:56.899 --> 01:59:58.484
I am going to stop building!

01:59:58.567 --> 02:00:01.820
No, this is the moment
when you're going to start.

02:00:01.904 --> 02:00:06.742
Because you won't be alone.
I'll be with you, and we'll do it together.

02:00:06.825 --> 02:00:09.036
But what are we going to build, Hilde?

02:00:09.119 --> 02:00:12.414
We're going to build these
very special structures...

02:00:12.498 --> 02:00:15.417
that will be more beautiful
than anything on earth.

02:00:15.501 --> 02:00:17.044
- You mean -
- Yes.

02:00:17.127 --> 02:00:19.546
We're going to build dream palaces...

02:00:19.630 --> 02:00:21.965
that will be able to stand firmly...

02:00:22.049 --> 02:00:24.301
right in the middle of the sky.

02:00:24.384 --> 02:00:27.888
They will stand firmly
in the middle of the sky.

02:00:27.971 --> 02:00:28.722
Solness!

02:00:28.805 --> 02:00:30.265
If I were to try it, Hilde -

02:00:30.349 --> 02:00:32.392
If I were to try to climb
the tower tonight -

02:00:32.476 --> 02:00:35.395
If I were to make it
to the top of the tower...

02:00:35.479 --> 02:00:39.566
I would stand there
and I would make a very simple vow -

02:00:39.650 --> 02:00:43.237
to devote the rest of my life
to building the only structures...

02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:45.781
which actually
can contain human happiness.

02:00:45.864 --> 02:00:47.157
That's right.

02:00:47.241 --> 02:00:49.409
Those extraordinary towers...

02:00:49.493 --> 02:00:53.705
that stand firmly
right in the middle of the sky.

02:00:53.789 --> 02:00:57.125
And I would vow to build them together...

02:00:57.209 --> 02:00:59.586
with a princess whom I love.

02:00:59.670 --> 02:01:01.088
I need that blue bottle!

02:01:01.171 --> 02:01:04.550
Then I would wave wildly
to everyone below...

02:01:04.633 --> 02:01:06.218
and I would climb down...

02:01:06.301 --> 02:01:10.681
and I would throw my arms
around my princess's neck...

02:01:10.764 --> 02:01:13.433
and I would kiss her and kiss her.

he's ready to climb
the tower with the wreath.

Well, I'm going
to go down there myself now.

What are you going
to do down there, Halvard?

02:01:32.995 --> 02:01:37.124
Well, I need to be with the men
who are working down there.

I mean, that's where I usually am
on these occasions.

02:01:41.670 --> 02:01:45.173
You have to tell Mr. Tesman
he has to be so careful - [ Sniffles ]

02:01:45.257 --> 02:01:46.758
When he climbs that tower.

02:01:46.842 --> 02:01:49.845
Promise me you won't forget to tell him.

He can't keep going.

02:02:25.339 --> 02:02:27.090
