02:12.632 --> 02:16.068
This film is dedicated to prisoners of war.

02:16.136 --> 02:20.072
Their unbroken spirit is the
symbol of a moral victory

02:20.140 --> 02:22.574
for which no bells have pealed.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.007
And which will
not be remembered

02:24.077 --> 02:27.569
with the battle names on
regimental colors.

02:27.647 --> 02:31.242
It was a war in which
no decorations could be given,

02:31.317 --> 02:32.909
but to have come out of it

02:32.986 --> 02:37.082
with a whole spirit
is its highest honor.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.421
These are a few of those men

02:39.492 --> 02:42.086
captured in the summer of 1 940.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.255
They were the men who
stood on the Dial,

02:44.330 --> 02:46.423
the Somme,
and the La Basi Canal,

02:46.499 --> 02:49.093
who fought at Calais,
April, St. Valery,

02:49.169 --> 02:53.606
and the vital perimeter around
the Beaches of Dunkirk,

02:53.673 --> 02:58.610
the men who held on until the German armor
thundered past their lines.

02:58.678 --> 03:02.614
220 miles they marched
into captivity,

03:02.682 --> 03:07.119
through that blazing, gusty June,
through France, through Belgium,

03:07.187 --> 03:10.179
through Holland,
to the Rhine.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.174
Ahh...

04:03.243 --> 04:05.177
Beer isn't what
it used to be.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.679
I hope the French beer isn't what
it used to be, either.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.180
Remember the last time, Ted?.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.683
Yeah, I remember something
better than beer, too.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.845
Ooh, she was
a smasher.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.183
I can see her
hair now,

04:16.255 --> 04:17.689
blacker than coal.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.692
Ooh, boy!. She taught
me a thing or two.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.695
Pity you kept it to yourself.

04:23.763 --> 04:27.199
It's proud we should be married
to a couple of Don Juans.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.201
Don't believe a girl
ever looked at him twice.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.702
Poor old dear.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.203
Yes, you looked twice, didn't you?.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.705
You caught me off me guard.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.241
I was low following the flu.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.209
Wonder what made you marry me.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.213
You don't know?.
That wicked tenor voice you have.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.714
Leave them.
That's men tend to that.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.010
Any more for any more?.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.710
No, thank you.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.377
It's nearly 1 2:00.
We've got to be at the depot at 700.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.818
Come on home,...

04:48.888 --> 04:50.719
we'll have 'em both back
before you can turn round.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.223
War will be over
by Christmas.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.725
War will be over
by Christmas?.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.090
Where have I heard
that before?.

04:55.161 --> 04:56.719
It's a shame we got to
close the business.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.730
Why, it's just habit
we've got into,

04:58.798 --> 05:00.732
fighting the same war
every 20 years.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.233
Nasty habit, too.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.234
Good night, Flo.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.736
Good night.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.237
See you in the morning.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.466
All right.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.235
She's a troubled worrier,...

05:09.309 --> 05:10.901
Shame she never had kids.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.241
And her always wanting them so much.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.746
They'd have took her mind off things.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.078
Well, it's too late now, I suppose.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.085
Are you sorry Glad and Mary are grown up?.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.247
Well, I am and I'm not,
in a manner of speaking.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.917
What about starting
all over again, old girl?.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.755
No, thank you, Ted.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.761
I'm too old for that kind of war work.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.319
Ha ha ha!

06:59.919 --> 07:01.284
Thanks, Stephen.
I liked that a lot.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.844
The boy definitely shows promise.

07:02.922 --> 07:03.854
Nearly 1 :00.

07:03.923 --> 07:04.855
May I catch a lift?.

07:04.924 --> 07:05.856
Yes, of course.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.358
Come on, Carol.
Put your bonnet on.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.860
Cheerio, Stephen.
See you before you embark.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.020
Right-o, Robert.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.859
Good-bye, Stephen, darling.
Take care of yourself.

07:11.931 --> 07:12.863
Good night.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.422
Well, wait for me.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.870
Stephen.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.872
Come on, Carol!

07:20.940 --> 07:23.374
All right, Robert!

07:23.443 --> 07:25.434
Caroline.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.440
Caroline!
Caroline!

07:40.460 --> 07:42.860
Stephen.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.453
Caroline.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.957
You left your scarf.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.904
I know.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.906
I had to come back.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.407
Robert.
What about him?.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.410
I wanted to tell you.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.345
It's all over with Robert.

08:01.414 --> 08:04.406
I think he understands.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.418
I told him 3 weeks ago.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.477
We met 3 weeks ago.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.480
I wasn't sure until tonight.

08:13.993 --> 08:14.982
Caroline.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.441
You've only 48 hours
before you go to France.

08:29.509 --> 08:33.946
It's nothing and it's everything.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.446
Everything.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.506
I hope you know how
to get a special license.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.498
And don't forget to write, David.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.001
Yes, Mum.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.502
And let us know if there's
anything you want.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.833
Thank you, Mrs. McDougall.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.065
Will you write to me, Elspeth?.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.129
David, I will.

09:35.207 --> 09:36.504
You see, l--

09:40.580 --> 09:42.013
Yes, David.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.013
Good-bye, David.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.515
Good-bye, David, my boy.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.017
Good-bye, Mother.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.518
Take care of yourself, David.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.020
Yes, Mrs. McDougall.
Elspeth, you see, l--

09:49.088 --> 09:50.180
Me too, David.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.518
What did you say?.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.024
I love you.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.617
Elspeth. Elspeth,
will you marry me?.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.094
Yes, David!

10:56.656 --> 10:58.089
What's he talking about?.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.681
Sorry.
I've no idea.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.784
Can I be of any help?.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.522
Do you speak German?.
Good.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.938
He says the officers must be
separated from the men.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.102
But we must keep the wounded with us.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.612
We've only got one M.O.
among the lot of us.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.556
He says they may stay with us
till we reach the camp.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.184
Thank you.

11:35.261 --> 11:38.128
Anyway, a lot of them will remain
automatically on the orderlies'...

11:38.197 --> 11:39.129
That's right.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.688
Well, come on, lads.
In we go.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.151
How's tricks,...?.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.151
Mustn't grumble, sir.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.653
You'll feel better
with a...

12:02.722 --> 12:04.155
Thank you, sir.

12:06.225 --> 12:09.160
I don't know that you ought
to smoke with that chest.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.661
Oh, it's nothing.
Wound's practically healed.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.664
It's a pretty bad show all around.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.166
I take it you fellows feel the same as I do.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.828
We mustn't let the Jerries see we're down.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.165
Take the Jerries to get me down?.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.500
It's them ruddy cobbles.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.666
What can I do for my feet, sir?.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.676
Do what I do.
Try to forget 'em.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.177
I can't take 'em off, can l?.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.611
How are you, Lennox?.
Eyes hurting you a bit?.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.171
A wee bit, sir.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.183
We'll get the Jerries to give you
some proper treatment

12:32.251 --> 12:34.185
As soon as we reach camp.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.185
Thank you, sir.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.188
How about you?.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.190
Mustn't grumble.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.190
You okay?.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.191
Not too bad.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.192
How's the arm?.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.193
Feels better now,
sir.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.854
Good boy.
All right, lads.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.693
It won't be long now.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.701
Then you'll be able to have a real rest.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.703
Thanks for the help just now.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.705
Useful man to know.
Perfect German.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.708
Dalrymple's my name.
31 st Lancers.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.710
Geoffrey Mitchell,
5th Oxfordshire light infantry.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.645
Oh, where did the
Jerries pick you up?.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.217
Oh, really?. I didn't know the 5th
were anywhere near there.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.274
Yes.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.920
March to attention!

16:41.000 --> 16:42.433
Good afternoon.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.935
Good afternoon.
Do sit down, would you?.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.437
Thank you.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.439
My name's Celia mitchell.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.941
I've heard my husband may
be a prisoner of war--

16:51.010 --> 16:52.443
Captain Geoffrey Mitchell.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.446
Maybe. Didn't the war office
notify you, Mrs. Mitchell?.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.950
Well, no, you see, I don't suppose
he put me down as next of kin.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.952
Oh, I beg your pardon.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.453
Your husband's regiment?.

17:02.521 --> 17:03.954
5th Oxford
light infantry.

17:04.022 --> 17:07.959
General index. Give me particulars
of Captain Geoffrey Mitchell,

17:08.027 --> 17:09.961
5th Oxfordshire
light infantry, will you?.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.462
I'd like to send him parcels.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.963
I suppose I can do that.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.464
Oh, yes, certainly.

17:14.532 --> 17:18.469
... flag 27.
Prisoner of war number 1376.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.027
Thank you.

17:28.547 --> 17:29.980
Hello, Mummy!

17:30.049 --> 17:31.482
Hello, darling.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.983
Have you had a lovely day
with Grandpa?.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.986
Will Father ever come back to us,
Grandpa,

17:35.054 --> 17:36.988
Even when the war's over?.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.990
Well, would you be glad if he did?.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.992
No. He used to make Mummy cry.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.322
He is a prisoner.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.418
Hello, Desmond.

17:43.495 --> 17:44.484
Hello, Mummy.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.054
Janet, I'll leave you in charge.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.004
Well?.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.065
He didn't put me down as next of kin.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.518
Well, that seems to be the final gesture,
doesn't it, my dear?.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.019
It was only logical, I suppose.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.419
Poor Geoffrey.

18:10.489 --> 18:12.013
Poor Geoffrey?.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.527
Well, I for one don't intend to shed
any tears over him.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.027
Father?.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.030
I'm going to write to him.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.030
You are?.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.532
Yes.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.534
Can't do any harm or good.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.537
They must be glad
of any news of home.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.038
I don't suppose poor Geoffrey
ever portrayed

18:28.107 --> 18:29.540
the faintest interest in his home.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.042
I can tell him how the children
are getting on.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.046
I can see Geoffrey regaling
his fellow prisoners

18:35.114 --> 18:38.049
with news of the children he's
scarcely ever seen.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.051
You're afraid, aren't you, Father?.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.714
Certainly. I'm afraid that you may let
yourself be carried away

18:43.789 --> 18:47.054
by sentimentality and suggest
patching things up with him.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.924
Don't worry.

18:49.995 --> 18:52.054
We said so many hard,
cruel things to each other.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.065
I'd like to wipe out
the memory of them.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.567
And then if we should happen to meet
when the war's over,

18:56.635 --> 18:58.626
it won't be as enemies.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.592
Here. Go easy
with the soap.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.093
Sorry, old boy.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.097
We may make it last 2 days more
if we're very careful.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.100
After that, we've got to make
do with godliness.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.103
I say, Padre, what are you smoking?.
Sauerkraut?.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.105
Fag ends, fag ends, fag ends.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.108
Lucky fellow. I'm down to
Mr. Middleton's specials.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.112
I hear there's a bush up by the...

19:41.180 --> 19:42.613
That's not too bad in a pipe.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.114
Had a marvelous
dream last night.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.616
Anybody I know?.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.117
Eggs and bacon.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.620
Tomato ketchup this time.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.622
We must have lost
a shocking lot of stuff.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.282
There's nothing to stop 'em.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.620
He's bound to invade
before the end of summer,

19:54.693 --> 19:56.126
And that's the end of us.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.628
Here, steady.
What about the home fleet?.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.129
What about the Luftwaffe
waiting for the home fleet?.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.631
Well, of all the damn defeated!

20:00.699 --> 20:02.132
Well, if you prefer to be a ruddy halfwit.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.634
What about the RAF?.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.294
Hitler can't stage an invasion

20:05.370 --> 20:07.133
until he's got control of the air,

20:07.206 --> 20:09.140
and I don't see the boys handing
him that on a plate.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.641
Hear, hear!

20:10.709 --> 20:12.973
You can't judge Hitler
by ordinary standards.

20:13.045 --> 20:17.709
If he thinks he'll invade,
he'll invade.

20:24.122 --> 20:26.647
My old woman makes the kids pay a penny
a week for the Red Cross.

20:26.725 --> 20:29.159
I'm writing to her to stop that caper.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.661
Red ruddy Cross!

20:30.729 --> 20:32.663
Bloody sausage we
ever get out of it!

20:32.731 --> 20:34.198
It's only 2 months.

20:34.266 --> 20:38.168
Don't forget, there were only a few
hundred prisoners here before.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.670
Now there are tens of thousands.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.000
It's a big job.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.665
Yeah. Don't let's kid ourselves.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.333
Nobody worries about us anymore.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.172
We've been written off.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.179
You're a pessimist.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.839
How do you spell "sufficient"?.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.678
Same as the Sergeant
Major's blessing,

20:51.750 --> 20:53.684
Two "F"s and 1 "C".

20:53.752 --> 20:55.185
Writing about the grub.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.687
Muck, I call it.

20:56.755 --> 20:59.519
Bit of the old woman's cooking,
is what I'd like now.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.116
What a sucker I was
joining the ruddy army.

21:02.194 --> 21:05.186
Pitching meself coming it loose with some
of those rowdy old French dames.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.199
Here I am shut up in this place,
then I'll be past it.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.202
You ought to have joined the Navy
and let the world see you.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.204
Now, son, there's no use you blowing off.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.705
Take things as you find them,

21:14.773 --> 21:16.365
That's always been my motto.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.703
The way I look at it is--

21:17.776 --> 21:19.209
Look at you!
Drip, drip, drip.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.711
You turn me up.
You're worse than a woman.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.713
Knock it, sonny.
I was swinging a rifle

21:22.781 --> 21:24.214
when your nappies was
swinging on the line.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.217
Swinging a lead, more like it.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.219
Here, if you're looking for a kip
on the ear, my lad,

21:28.287 --> 21:29.720
you've come to
the right person.

21:29.788 --> 21:30.982
Ohh!

21:31.056 --> 21:32.216
That cigarette.
Let me see it.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.656
What do you mean see it?.

21:33.725 --> 21:35.215
Well, it's a Player's.
Where did you get it?.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.727
Saved it up, of course.
What's it got to do with you?.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.228
I had 3 Player's left.
You stole it!

21:38.297 --> 21:39.491
Ah, go chase yourself.

21:39.564 --> 21:40.724
Hand it over!

21:40.799 --> 21:41.731
Pipe down, you little Welshman.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.789
Give it back.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.243
You did pinch that fag of young...

21:53.312 --> 21:54.745
Yes, I did. So what?.

21:54.813 --> 21:55.745
Just this.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.748
Ooh!

21:58.817 --> 22:00.478
Been asking for it, sonny.

22:00.552 --> 22:05.251
I'm a man of peace, and peace is what
I'm gonna have plenty of in here.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.521
Blimey. They'll have to have you
at the peace conference.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.185
How are you today, Jessup?.

22:10.262 --> 22:11.251
Mustn't grumble, sir.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.695
Managed to get on his feet.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.265
We'll soon get you out of here.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.325
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.273
Morning, Lennox.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.603
Oh, good morning, sir.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.142
Got some good news for you, David.

22:25.210 --> 22:26.575
Yes, Padre?.

22:26.645 --> 22:29.273
Yes, my lad. You'll be rejoining
the rest of us tomorrow.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.781
Oh, that's fine, sir.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.283
And I'll be able to take this bandage off.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.876
Not yet, I'm afraid.

22:34.953 --> 22:38.286
You'll have to wait till the optic nerve
is completely healthy again.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.291
Then they'll send you to the
eye hospital for an operation.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.294
So you'll have to be
a very patient patient, my boy.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.353
I'll do my best, sir.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.355
That's right.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.304
I'm sorry, mate.
I'll give you a packet of 20

22:54.373 --> 22:56.307
when the Red Cross parcels come.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.309
Losing my temper over a fag.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.311
I shouldn't have left them roving about.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.973
You know, you wouldn't be a bad lad,

23:03.048 --> 23:04.811
if you got rid of
some of your nasty habits.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.818
Don't knock it.
Leave all that reforming stuff to the padre.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.320
What's your job in
Civvy Street?.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.822
Only suckers work.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.118
Oh, a "Y" boy, eh?.

23:13.191 --> 23:14.317
You bet.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.827
Me and Ted's
in the building business.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.329
What about learning
the trade when we get home?.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.332
I'll be home long
before you two mugs.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.835
You got out of tougher
spots than this, eh?.

23:24.903 --> 23:25.835
Sure.

23:25.904 --> 23:26.836
Got a plan?.

23:26.905 --> 23:27.837
Dozens of 'em.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.339
For instance--

23:29.408 --> 23:31.342
You know, I can't make up me mind

23:31.410 --> 23:34.402
whether to turn this into a brigantine
or a schooner.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.855
I wonder how Jane's
getting on these days?.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.356
Who is Jane?.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.858
Your girl?.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.861
No, no, the Jane,
the strip in the "Mirror".

23:50.929 --> 23:53.363
Oh, yes, the strip in the "Mirror".

23:53.432 --> 23:54.865
Well, I suppose a highbrow like you

23:54.933 --> 23:57.766
wouldn't read the "Daily Mirror."

23:57.836 --> 23:58.996
Why highbrow?.

23:59.070 --> 24:01.368
I mean, perfect German
and all that sort of thing.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.374
Spent much time in Germany?.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.876
Yes, as a matter of fact, I have.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.378
Come to think of it, it's funny
that none of the rest

24:08.447 --> 24:09.880
of your chaps
got caught with you.

24:09.948 --> 24:10.880
Yes.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.541
Did you have a company?.

24:12.617 --> 24:13.879
Yes, machine gun company.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.442
Machine gun company?.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.889
You see--

24:18.957 --> 24:21.448
I think I'll turn it up.
Wound's hurting a bit.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.899
And all I have to do is stow away
in one of them garbage bins

24:28.967 --> 24:31.401
Or something--why,
it's as easy as--

24:31.470 --> 24:34.439
If you're planning
an escape, Mathews,

24:34.506 --> 24:35.905
may I give you
a piece of advice?.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.908
Individual escapes
hardly ever succeed.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.409
These things have to
be very carefully planned

24:39.478 --> 24:41.639
and coordinated by
a whole group.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.271
All the same, sir, I'm
gonna have a go at it

24:43.348 --> 24:45.373
If you have no objections.

24:45.450 --> 24:47.475
Well, good luck to you.

24:49.855 --> 24:52.585
Good luck.
Two-faced bleeder.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.453
I don't know what it is,

24:53.525 --> 24:55.425
but there's something
phony about that bloke.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.927
Always sucking up
with the german m.O.

24:56.995 --> 24:57.927
Like...
Or somebody.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.987
Look, men.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.936
That settles it.

25:06.004 --> 25:08.302
But they do have machine gun
companies in the German army.

25:08.373 --> 25:10.034
Do you seriously think
he's a traitor?.

25:10.108 --> 25:10.938
He speaks German
as well as any German.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.443
Of course he does.
Why shouldn't he be a German

25:13.512 --> 25:14.638
planted here
as a stool pigeon?.

25:14.713 --> 25:15.873
That would account
for a lot of things.

25:15.947 --> 25:17.278
Yes, we're always
talking about home.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.442
- He never does.
- I hate to believe it.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.951
Come in.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.146
May I report
something, sir?.

25:23.221 --> 25:24.313
Go ahead.

25:24.389 --> 25:26.152
Well, it's rather
confidential, sir.

25:26.224 --> 25:28.590
It's about somebody
we think's a 5th colonist.

25:28.660 --> 25:29.456
An officer?.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.961
A matter of fact, sir, it is.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.189
Captain Mitchell, sir.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.424
There you are.

25:33.498 --> 25:34.965
A minute ago, he overheard me
planning a breakout

25:35.033 --> 25:36.898
and went straight over and talked
to one of the German guards.

25:36.968 --> 25:37.957
Thank you, Mathews.

25:38.036 --> 25:38.968
Keep your mouth shut
for the time being.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.437
Very good, sir.

25:41.506 --> 25:42.973
There's only one thing
to do with a rat.

25:43.041 --> 25:43.837
String him up!

25:43.909 --> 25:44.967
Here, wait a bit.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.476
Man's innocent
till he's proved guilty.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.479
Don't let us behave
like a bunch of nazis.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.912
Come on.

25:54.452 --> 25:58.149
Oh, Mitchell, you didn't destroy
your identity card, did you?.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.281
No, why?.

25:59.357 --> 26:01.552
Oh, just check up.
Have a look at it?.

26:12.971 --> 26:14.404
Do you mind duplicating
your signature?.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.837
You can't do it, you swine,
'cause your name isn't Mitchell!

26:22.914 --> 26:24.006
Come on, what are we waiting for?.
Let's get it over with!

26:24.249 --> 26:25.580
Stop it!

26:25.650 --> 26:27.845
If you have anything to say,
you better say it quick.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.079
It's a long story, and--

26:31.957 --> 26:32.946
You wouldn't believe a word of it.

26:33.024 --> 26:34.013
You're dead right,
we wouldn't!

26:34.092 --> 26:35.525
Shut up!
Go on, spill it.

26:36.695 --> 26:38.822
I'm not a German.
I'm a Czech.

26:38.897 --> 26:39.955
A Czech in British
officer's uniform?.

26:40.031 --> 26:41.020
That's bloody likely!

26:41.099 --> 26:43.033
I'm in charge here.
Shut up, and that's an order!

26:43.935 --> 26:45.425
Go on.

26:45.503 --> 26:47.630
I escaped from
a German concentration camp.

26:47.706 --> 26:48.900
I got through to France,

26:48.974 --> 26:50.532
and I took this uniform
and the identity card

26:50.609 --> 26:52.543
from Mitchell's dead body.

26:53.712 --> 26:55.543
It was my only chance if
the Germans caught up with me.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.548
If that's the truth,
why didn't you tell us at once?.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.551
Would you have believed me
any more than you do now?.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.554
Besides, I have more to fear
from the stool pigeons than you have.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.180
You've no proof of your story.

27:05.256 --> 27:07.053
None. How could I have?.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.787
How do you come to speak such
perfect English and German?.

27:09.861 --> 27:13.297
My father was at the Czech embassy
in London after the last war.

27:13.365 --> 27:14.559
I spent my childhood there.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.568
German is a sort of second
language in Czechoslovakia.

27:17.636 --> 27:21.072
I became professor of English
at Prague University.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.073
I'm not much of a soldier, I'm afraid.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.575
What were you talking about
to that guard just now?.

27:25.644 --> 27:29.580
Oh, I was trying to get
a chess set for David Lennox.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.081
Achtung! Achtung!

27:31.149 --> 27:33.481
All British prisoners
will parade at once.

27:37.255 --> 27:38.586
You may get proof
of my story after all.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.090
How?.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.989
The civilian. His name's Forster.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.584
- Gestapo.
- How do you know?.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.596
For a time, he ran
the concentration camp I was in.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.258
You think he'll recognize you?.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.597
Well, if he does,
he'll do your job for you.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.933
- Achtung! Achtung!
- Come on.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.165
All British prisoners
will parade at once.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.176
Stand your men at ease, please.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.620
Stand at ease!

28:09.688 --> 28:13.818
Gentlemen, I present to you
Herr Forster-- the foreign office.

28:13.892 --> 28:14.620
Gentlemen...

28:14.693 --> 28:17.594
For the time being,
all communications

28:17.662 --> 28:21.291
between Germany and England
are at a standstill.

28:21.366 --> 28:24.335
Your letters, therefore,
cannot leave this country.

28:24.402 --> 28:26.836
To keep you informed, however,

28:26.905 --> 28:31.137
our news bulletins will be
broadcast to you in English.

28:31.209 --> 28:35.270
And as you cannot hope
to receive news from home,

28:35.346 --> 28:37.177
arrangements have been
made for you

28:37.248 --> 28:40.217
to broadcast messages
to your next of kin.

28:42.220 --> 28:45.314
Will all those
who wish to avail themselves

28:45.390 --> 28:49.224
of Herr Forster's offer,
take 3 paces forward!

29:08.246 --> 29:10.680
You are the senior British officer?.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.011
Yes.

29:12.083 --> 29:15.678
Are your men afraid that this is
some sort of propaganda trick?.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.279
Well, it's just possible.

29:18.356 --> 29:19.755
As you wish.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.353
Your name?.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.192
- Mitchell.
- Mitchell?.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.596
You are the officer acting
as hospital interpreter.

29:28.666 --> 29:29.655
Yes.

29:29.734 --> 29:32.430
I understand you speak
almost perfect German.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.563
That's rather unusual
for an Englishman.

29:34.639 --> 29:35.628
Is it?.

29:35.707 --> 29:38.437
I wonder why your face
seems familiar.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.307
I have many friends in England.

29:40.378 --> 29:41.709
Possibly we met there.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.714
Possibly.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.909
Excuse me.

29:45.984 --> 29:47.542
Yes?.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.851
Do you wish to continue
this conversation?.

29:51.923 --> 29:53.390
No.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.551
Prisoners cannot be required
to answer any questions

29:55.627 --> 29:57.720
other than those relating to
name, rank, and number.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.730
Quite, quite.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.789
The matter is of no importance.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.681
This is today's
official war communique

30:19.751 --> 30:21.742
Issued by the
German high command.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.756
The battle of Britain has entered
upon a new and final stage.

30:25.824 --> 30:31.262
Annihilation of England's towns and cities
by the all-conquering Luftwaffe.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.763
Last night, just before sunset,

30:33.832 --> 30:35.766
air-raid sirens sounded their
ominous wailing notes

30:35.834 --> 30:39.770
To the 9 million inhabitants
of greater london.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.433
All night, an endless stream
of bombers roared about the city

30:43.508 --> 30:46.136
Discharging their loads
of high-explosive

30:46.211 --> 30:47.769
and incendiary bombs.

30:47.846 --> 30:51.282
Anti-aircraft opposition
was negligible,

30:51.349 --> 30:54.284
For the British do not possess the guns to
defend their homeland.

30:54.352 --> 30:58.789
And this attack will continue
tonight from dusk till dawn

30:58.857 --> 31:03.294
until the nerve center and capital
city of the British empire

31:03.361 --> 31:07.297
Is reduced to a vast pile
of rubble, dust, and ashes.

31:07.365 --> 31:11.233
The words of our great battle
hymn have come true at last.

31:14.405 --> 31:16.965
We march against England.

32:07.425 --> 32:11.156
Come on, boys.
Let's give 'em our great battle hymn!

32:11.229 --> 32:14.858
Roll out the barrel

32:14.933 --> 32:18.869
We'll have a barrel of fun

32:18.937 --> 32:22.805
Roll out the barrel

32:22.874 --> 32:24.933
We've got the blues on the run

32:26.611 --> 32:29.876
ing, boom, terrara

32:29.948 --> 32:34.385
Sing out a song
of good cheer

32:34.452 --> 32:37.387
Now's the time
to roll the barrel

32:37.455 --> 32:40.891
'Cause the gang's all here

32:40.959 --> 32:41.891
Come on!

32:41.960 --> 32:45.396
Roll out the barrel

32:45.463 --> 32:49.399
We'll have a barrel of fun

32:49.467 --> 32:52.459
Roll out the barrel

32:52.537 --> 32:56.906
We've got the blues
on the run

32:56.975 --> 32:59.910
Zing, boom, terrara

32:59.978 --> 33:03.914
Sing out a song
of good cheer

33:03.982 --> 33:07.418
Mow's the time
to roll the barrel

33:07.485 --> 33:10.977
'Cause the gang's all here

33:16.494 --> 33:18.928
You should have come to see me
before this, Mrs. Evans.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.430
Nothing wrong, is there?.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.932
No, but you're not
exactly robust.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.936
I had the flu last year,
but nothing since.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.938
And you're over 40,
aren't you?.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.439
Only just.

33:29.507 --> 33:32.943
Well, we needn't make
any decision yet.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.444
Decision?.

33:34.512 --> 33:37.504
I may have to suggest
an operation.

33:39.517 --> 33:41.951
I see.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.749
Thank you, doctor.

33:43.821 --> 33:45.448
I was at Finn's
the night before last.

33:45.723 --> 33:46.951
Miracle none of us copped it.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.959
The guvnor was just
standing around.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.460
This one's on
the house, he said.

33:50.528 --> 33:51.961
And it was.

33:52.030 --> 33:52.962
Well, dear?.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.521
Everything's all right.

33:54.599 --> 33:57.966
Waste of time and money it was,
making me come and see the old doctor.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.970
Your dad wants you
to make quite sure, you know.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.471
Yes, of course.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.973
I always felt
I'd failed him,

34:04.042 --> 34:05.976
but never a word
of reproach.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.478
There's kind he is,
all through.

34:08.545 --> 34:10.980
But now,
now I won't fail him.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.539
I know I won't.

34:31.069 --> 34:34.004
Stephen wrote that for me.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.005
My application's
been approved, Carol.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.007
Staff job, west end...

34:38.076 --> 34:40.510
I was going to ask you
for a photograph,

34:40.578 --> 34:43.012
But perhaps I'm better without it.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.514
Look, Robert,

34:44.581 --> 34:46.516
Ever since Beryl's been
living here with me,

34:46.583 --> 34:48.518
I've seen how crazy
she is about you.

34:48.585 --> 34:50.018
Why don't you and she--

34:51.089 --> 34:52.818
Beryl and I might have
made a go of it

34:52.889 --> 34:54.187
if I hadn't met you first.

34:54.257 --> 34:55.520
I'm sorry, Robert.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.857
I did treat you shabbily.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.863
No, you didn't.
I realize now

34:59.931 --> 35:01.421
you were never more
than just fond of me.

35:01.499 --> 35:04.525
You'd have realized it, too,
even if Stephen hadn't turned up.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.035
I always will be
fond of you.

35:06.104 --> 35:09.039
As long as you're happy.
That's what matters.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.041
That's sweet of you.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.599
My dear.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.054
I'm sorry.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.113
I'm not.

35:28.626 --> 35:32.062
But it's got to be
good-bye, Robert.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.620
Good-bye, Beryl.

35:56.654 --> 35:59.589
Last Christmas,
I had my first concert.

35:59.657 --> 36:02.148
It's there
I met Caroline.

36:07.665 --> 36:11.601
Last christmas, I was in Dachau
concentration camp.

36:11.669 --> 36:15.605
Christmas eve, a new batch
of prisoners came in.

36:15.673 --> 36:19.109
One of them brought
me news of my family.

36:19.177 --> 36:23.113
They'd been caught
giving food to a polish Jew.

36:23.181 --> 36:27.117
They were taken out and shot.

36:27.185 --> 36:32.054
My father, my mother.

36:32.123 --> 36:33.112
All of them.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.125
Only 36 shopping days
to Christmas.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.457
Christmas. Parked around
a blazing fire

36:37.528 --> 36:39.120
with a great bowl of hot rum punch.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.630
Looks like it's snowing again.

36:40.698 --> 36:42.131
That should raise
the temperature a bit.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.134
What binds me is living
by courtesy of Jerry.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.466
Can't see any future
in it, really.

36:46.537 --> 36:48.630
They say the first
7 years are the hardest.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.139
If the next 6 are
anything like this...

36:50.208 --> 36:52.642
Well, the Red Cross parcels
are bound to arrive soon.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.143
You've been saying that for
exactly 4 months.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.648
I've been meaning it
for exactly 4 months.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.649
All I can think
about is food.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.311
Roast turkey,
mince pies, Christmas--

37:02.386 --> 37:03.444
Oh, shut up!

37:15.233 --> 37:17.167
Well, lad, it's me again.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.725
Yes, padre.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.230
David, they can't operate.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.677
Not ever?.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.235
No, David.

37:31.916 --> 37:35.249
I won't ever see again?.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.688
I don't believe it.
It's that German doctor.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.018
When I get back
to Scotland--

37:40.091 --> 37:41.251
No.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.254
David, it's no use.
You've got to face it.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.702
I'll not need this anymore.

37:52.770 --> 37:55.705
You feel now there's
nothing left to live for,

37:55.773 --> 37:59.709
And that feeling will
go on for a long time,

37:59.777 --> 38:05.215
But then you'll begin
to remember the things that are left.

38:05.283 --> 38:10.721
You'll begin to realize that this
darkness of yours is not absolute.

38:10.788 --> 38:15.725
David, the things that make life
worthwhile for all of us--

38:15.793 --> 38:20.230
Kindness, affection,
companionship--

38:20.298 --> 38:24.234
The loss of your sight
can never argue those things, David.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.236
We're your friends here.

38:26.304 --> 38:31.241
We offer you our help
and understanding.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.244
And waiting to
welcome you home

38:34.312 --> 38:39.807
when all this is over,
are your own folk who love you.

38:44.822 --> 38:46.312
I'll be all right.

39:06.344 --> 39:10.474
18, 20, 21.

39:10.548 --> 39:11.845
What's for tea?.

39:11.916 --> 39:13.281
Fancy cakes.
Just fancy you've had 'em.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.785
Good job we haven't got any
brass monkeys in here,

39:15.853 --> 39:18.788
We'd have the RSPCA
down on us, and no error.

39:18.856 --> 39:21.450
Can't you do anything
with this ruddy stove?.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.516
Isn't there anything
else to burn?.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.300
All right.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.769
I never said a word, did l?.

39:33.838 --> 39:35.305
Go on, burn the ruddy thing.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.863
It's enough for a brew up.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.311
They've come!
Hundreds and hundreds of 'em!

39:50.388 --> 39:52.322
All right, I'll bite.
Hundreds of what?.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.290
Red Cross parcels
with ruddy...

39:54.358 --> 39:56.383
[all shouting]

40:01.899 --> 40:03.332
The Red Cross parcels
are here!

40:03.401 --> 40:05.665
Hooray!

40:05.736 --> 40:07.328
Red Cross parcels
are here!

40:07.405 --> 40:09.396
Hooray!

40:44.442 --> 40:49.880
O come all ye faithful

40:49.947 --> 40:54.384
Yoyful and triumphant

40:54.452 --> 41:00.322
o come ye, o come ye
to Bethlehem

41:04.462 --> 41:09.399
Come and behold him

41:09.467 --> 41:13.904
Born the king of angels

41:13.971 --> 41:18.908
O come let us adore him

41:18.976 --> 41:23.913
O come let us adore him

41:23.981 --> 41:29.419
O come let us adore him

41:29.487 --> 41:35.426
Christ the lord

41:35.493 --> 41:39.930
Sing choirs of angels...

41:39.997 --> 41:43.433
O.C. Sports--you.
O.C. music--Stephen Harley.

41:43.501 --> 41:44.934
Anything else
I haven't covered?.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.264
No. Extraordinary, isn't it?.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.430
We seem to have
specialists on every subject.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.940
Aren't you an expert
on anything?.

41:51.008 --> 41:52.441
Only racing, I'm afraid.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.944
I had thought of starting a little
bookmaking business.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.274
Why not?. Anyway,
your money will be safe.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.939
You can't welsh on us.

41:58.015 --> 41:58.947
Ha ha!

42:11.529 --> 42:12.962
Ok, number 4 shift.

42:13.030 --> 42:13.962
How far?.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.055
About 3 feet.

42:15.132 --> 42:16.463
Good. By the way,
doc, I put you down

42:16.534 --> 42:17.466
O.C. Entertainment.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.025
Fine.

42:19.103 --> 42:20.968
What about me?.
I've had masses of experience backstage.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.300
What sort of experience?.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.467
No need to make low
insinuendos, old man.

42:25.543 --> 42:26.976
Come on, fellows!
Here it is!

42:27.044 --> 42:28.534
Mail from home!

42:30.047 --> 42:30.979
Baker!

42:31.048 --> 42:31.980
Here!

42:32.049 --> 42:32.981
Macdonald!

42:33.050 --> 42:34.540
Here!

42:34.618 --> 42:37.485
My father's been thrown through
the dispensary window.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.489
What, by an angry patient?.

42:39.557 --> 42:40.990
No, a bomb.

42:41.058 --> 42:42.491
Well, well, they've requisitioned
the church hall.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.494
I say, that's serious.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.494
What is?.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.497
Veronica.
She sweats all night.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.499
Well, surely she can
do something about it,

42:49.567 --> 42:51.000
With all these
advertisements and things.

42:51.068 --> 42:52.501
Don't be a halfwit.
Veronica's a filly

42:52.570 --> 42:54.003
and is getting ready
for the flat.

42:54.071 --> 42:58.201
Oh, sorry, old boy.
I thought she was a...

42:58.275 --> 43:00.004
My kids have been
evacuated to the country.

43:00.077 --> 43:01.510
And my girl
joined the land army.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.012
Said she'll wait for me
till the cows come home.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.513
That's one way of putting it.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.016
Listen to this.
"Dear Daddy, today is your birthday.

43:07.084 --> 43:09.575
"l hope it will be your last."

43:14.558 --> 43:16.025
Hello, David.

43:16.093 --> 43:18.027
I didn't notice.
Shall I read your letter for you?.

43:18.095 --> 43:19.585
Thank you.

43:21.599 --> 43:25.592
It's signed...Elspeth.

43:27.237 --> 43:28.534
"Dearest David,

43:28.606 --> 43:31.541
"Your mother says I am
silly to worry about it,

43:31.609 --> 43:35.545
"but it seems queer
not a word from you yet.

43:35.613 --> 43:39.049
"Do please send me a line
when you get this.

43:39.116 --> 43:42.711
"The three of us had
a little party on your birthday.

43:42.786 --> 43:44.549
"Wouldn't it be wonderful,
darling

43:44.622 --> 43:47.216
"if you were home again
for your next?.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.555
"l miss you all the time.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.561
"Your loving Elspeth.

43:51.629 --> 43:56.566
"P.S. I'm going to join
the Wrens."

43:56.634 --> 43:58.067
Will you do me a favor?.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.568
I'd like to answer it at once.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.070
Yes, of course.

44:01.138 --> 44:02.571
Here's a form.

44:02.640 --> 44:06.576
I've got a pencil.
Ready when you are.

44:06.644 --> 44:09.579
My dearest Elspeth,

44:09.647 --> 44:13.879
I am dictating this
letter because my wound

44:13.951 --> 44:16.579
Is not quite better yet.

44:16.654 --> 44:19.555
I've been thinking things over.

44:19.623 --> 44:24.060
And this is to ask
if you will release me

44:24.128 --> 44:27.097
from our engagement.

44:27.164 --> 44:31.396
I realize now I don't feel the way

44:31.468 --> 44:36.098
I fancied I did about you,

44:36.173 --> 44:40.109
So it's best to make
a definite break.

44:40.177 --> 44:41.667
Yours, David.

44:44.481 --> 44:46.108
David, why not
tell her the truth?.

44:46.183 --> 44:47.616
It is the truth.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.277
About your eyes, I mean.

44:49.353 --> 44:51.116
Why not let her decide
when she knows?.

44:51.188 --> 44:52.621
Will you please
send that letter?.

44:52.690 --> 44:53.622
But David--

44:53.691 --> 44:55.124
Please!

44:55.192 --> 44:57.183
All right, David.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.630
Ted, it's it!
It's it!

45:00.698 --> 45:03.132
It's it!

45:03.200 --> 45:05.134
Wonderful news, man,
wonderful.

45:05.202 --> 45:08.000
It's Delish.
There's a baby coming.

45:08.072 --> 45:09.130
Good old Di!
I reckon that's

45:09.206 --> 45:11.640
the best Christmas
present you ever had.

45:11.709 --> 45:16.646
I can see her now,
the way she smiles with her eyes.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.648
Aye, indeed.
It's lovely to--

45:18.716 --> 45:20.149
How do I look
for a godfather?.

45:20.217 --> 45:22.151
Why, yes!
That's it, man.

45:22.219 --> 45:24.551
You and Flo.
It goes without saying.

45:24.621 --> 45:26.145
And what's the matter?.

45:26.223 --> 45:28.657
Got the same chit
from the income tax as me, old boy?.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.956
Well, don't worry.
They can't put us in jag.

45:31.028 --> 45:32.723
We've had it.

46:02.760 --> 46:05.695
What wouldn't I give to see
Queen's Park play Rangers this year.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.697
Never mind, padre.
They'll be playing over here one day.

46:07.765 --> 46:09.198
Achtung! Achtung!

46:09.266 --> 46:10.597
All British prisoners
will parade at once.

46:10.667 --> 46:11.725
Hello! What's cooking?.

46:11.802 --> 46:14.703
Forster's on the warpath. They're gonna
search the camp with a fine comb.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.205
Forster again.

46:16.273 --> 46:18.207
Achtung! Achtung!

46:18.275 --> 46:20.709
All British prisoners
will parade at once.

46:30.788 --> 46:32.221
Achtung! Achtung!

46:32.289 --> 46:34.723
All British prisoners
will parade at once.

46:53.310 --> 46:55.744
Gentlemen, we have
discovered your tunnel.

46:57.080 --> 46:59.241
Since you have thus abused
the amenities accorded you,

46:59.316 --> 47:03.685
and pending reconsideration
of the camp's security measures,

47:03.754 --> 47:07.747
all these amenities will be removed
until further notice.

47:07.825 --> 47:13.764
I've given instructions, therefore,
to confiscate all books, writing material,

47:13.831 --> 47:17.767
music, all tables and chairs,

47:17.835 --> 47:20.827
mirrors, knives,
and shaving equipment.

47:24.341 --> 47:26.832
You may dismiss the...

47:28.345 --> 47:30.836
Right. Dismissed.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.285
I suppose I shall have to
grow a beard after all.

47:40.357 --> 47:42.791
I don't know whether to have
one of those 2-pronged affairs

47:42.860 --> 47:44.794
or a natty little imperial.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.295
Wonder how long
they'll keep it up.

47:46.363 --> 47:47.796
Not more than a month,
I should think.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.298
Well, I'll keep on nagging
at the commandant.

47:49.366 --> 47:50.856
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

47:52.369 --> 47:53.802
Good afternoon.

47:53.871 --> 47:56.806
I hope this slight setback won't
prevent you from trying again,

47:56.874 --> 47:59.342
But I must add

47:59.409 --> 48:01.809
a moat will be dug around
the whole perimeter,

48:01.879 --> 48:04.871
which, as you know,
makes tunneling impossible.

48:07.885 --> 48:12.322
Captain mitchell, who speaks
such excellent German...

48:30.774 --> 48:33.743
What's he want this time?.

48:33.810 --> 48:35.835
Wants to know why I haven't written
a single letter home.

48:35.913 --> 48:37.346
Well, why should you?.

48:37.414 --> 48:38.847
Mitchell may have had nobody
particular to write to.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.349
But he had.

48:40.417 --> 48:41.850
This came today.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.910
It's from his wife.

48:45.422 --> 48:47.856
You must answer it,
or she'll make enquiries.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.358
You'll have to fake it.

48:49.426 --> 48:50.859
Seems a pretty
cruel fraud.

48:50.928 --> 48:52.361
You're wearing
a dead man's shoes.

48:52.429 --> 48:53.862
You've got to get
used to the feel of them.

48:53.931 --> 48:56.365
My handwriting. She'd know at once
it wasn't her husband.

48:56.433 --> 48:57.866
Yes, take a bit of figuring out.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.869
Alibi for using your left hand.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.928
That's what you need.

49:06.944 --> 49:08.377
I can't see much point in this,

49:08.445 --> 49:10.640
Now the blighters
have taken away the football.

49:10.714 --> 49:12.375
Well, anyway,
it's good exercise.

49:12.449 --> 49:15.885
Think so?. I suppose next week
they'll give us back the football

49:15.953 --> 49:17.887
and take away
the goalposts.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.752
Come on, it's
your turn now.

49:26.463 --> 49:27.452
Ready?.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.475
Look out!

49:54.992 --> 49:56.254
Good morning,
Mrs. Mitchell.

49:56.326 --> 49:57.816
Thank you.

50:11.675 --> 50:13.666
Oh, look.

50:15.012 --> 50:18.038
I've mastered the boiler
and the tire pump.

50:18.115 --> 50:21.448
I won't be defeated by
a miserable wireless set.

50:21.518 --> 50:22.951
I've heard from Geoffrey.

50:23.020 --> 50:24.419
Really?.

50:24.488 --> 50:25.955
Is he well?.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.547
I don't know what to make of it.

50:27.624 --> 50:29.114
He seems so changed.

50:29.192 --> 50:34.289
Good. Any change in Geoffrey
could only be for the better.

50:34.364 --> 50:37.800
Well, the change
seems to include his handwriting.

50:37.868 --> 50:40.234
Hurt his hand.
Using his left.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.974
Listen to this.

50:45.042 --> 50:49.172
"it is a world cut off
completely from the real world.

50:49.246 --> 50:51.976
"Time stands still here.

50:52.049 --> 50:55.849
"The future is remote.
The present empty.

50:55.919 --> 51:00.822
"Even the past begins
to seem unreal.

51:00.891 --> 51:04.327
"But a man must have
something to hold onto.

51:04.394 --> 51:08.660
He must forge lengths
to keep him sane.

51:10.233 --> 51:12.326
"Will you write
to me again, celia,

51:12.402 --> 51:15.269
"as though I were
a stranger?.

51:15.338 --> 51:19.638
"Somebody who knows nothing
of your life and your home.

51:21.912 --> 51:24.312
"Even of yourself."

51:24.381 --> 51:25.848
Changed?.

51:25.916 --> 51:30.615
Why, he's even learned
to write grammatically.

51:30.687 --> 51:33.247
Write to him as though
he were a stranger.

51:50.407 --> 51:51.874
Robert!

51:51.942 --> 51:53.375
Come back to be briefed.

51:53.443 --> 51:55.035
Sort of a hush-hush job.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.239
Thought you wouldn't mind
if I just called in this evening,

51:57.314 --> 51:59.339
Say hail and farewell.

51:59.416 --> 52:00.542
Of course not.

52:00.617 --> 52:01.879
Come in.

52:01.952 --> 52:04.216
You look ill, Carol.

52:04.287 --> 52:06.687
I'm all right.

52:06.756 --> 52:09.782
I ran into Beryl
in an odd sort of mood.

52:09.860 --> 52:12.192
I gather she isn't
living with you any longer.

52:12.262 --> 52:15.254
No. No, she left
soon after you went away.

52:15.332 --> 52:17.027
Heard from Stephen yet?.

52:17.100 --> 52:19.034
Oh, yes, I've heard
from Stephen.

52:19.102 --> 52:20.228
What's he say?.

52:20.303 --> 52:22.498
That our marriage
is all washed up.

52:22.572 --> 52:24.062
What?.

52:24.141 --> 52:27.440
He got a letter accusing me
of having an affair with you.

52:27.511 --> 52:32.005
Carol, l-- but who?.

52:32.082 --> 52:34.243
Beryl.

52:34.317 --> 52:35.579
Ahh...

52:35.652 --> 52:37.085
I see.

52:37.154 --> 52:38.985
And he actually believed it?.

52:39.055 --> 52:40.579
Yes.

52:40.657 --> 52:43.387
I'll write back myself
and tell him the whole thing's

52:43.460 --> 52:44.927
a deliberate, malicious lie.

52:44.995 --> 52:46.428
What for?.

52:46.496 --> 52:48.088
What for?. You don't want Stephen

52:48.165 --> 52:50.099
to go on thinking this, do you?.

52:50.167 --> 52:52.226
I don't care
what he thinks now.

52:52.302 --> 52:54.429
Carol, you mustn't
take it like that.

52:54.504 --> 52:55.937
Stephen's a prisoner of war.

52:56.006 --> 52:57.974
If you were in his place,
would you pay two seconds' attention

52:58.041 --> 52:59.531
to a poison pen letter?.

52:59.609 --> 53:01.668
I don't know.

53:04.281 --> 53:06.146
I'd never been
in love before.

53:08.952 --> 53:14.788
I thought being in love meant that
you trusted each other completely.

53:14.858 --> 53:18.817
All the things he said,

53:18.895 --> 53:21.728
I believed every word.

53:21.798 --> 53:24.266
Killed my love for him.

53:28.205 --> 53:31.936
Caroline, my darling,
I can't bear to see you cry.

53:40.884 --> 53:42.818
Don't forget to
drop us a line, dear,

53:42.886 --> 53:44.353
if there's anything you want.

53:44.421 --> 53:45.979
I've tried to get used to it,

53:46.056 --> 53:47.546
Bu I still can't believe it.

53:47.624 --> 53:49.023
We were so much in love.

53:49.092 --> 53:50.491
Ah, it's a mystery to me.

53:50.560 --> 53:52.323
He has a right to
change his mind, I suppose.

53:52.395 --> 53:54.260
Could it be that he
doesn't think it's fair

53:54.331 --> 53:56.424
to make Elspeth
wait on and on?.

53:56.499 --> 53:57.864
Do you think it might
be that?.

53:57.934 --> 53:59.595
No. I don't think
David's the kind

53:59.669 --> 54:02.502
to make that sort of sacrifice
for that sort of reason.

54:03.840 --> 54:04.829
Good-bye, my darling.

54:04.908 --> 54:05.840
Good-bye.

54:05.909 --> 54:06.898
Good-bye.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.839
The photograph I'm sending

54:11.915 --> 54:13.678
makes me look
absurdly young,

54:13.750 --> 54:16.446
but I'm no longer young.

54:16.519 --> 54:17.781
The one of Janet,

54:17.854 --> 54:19.685
that funny expression's
only shyness,

54:19.756 --> 54:21.018
not a stomach ache.

54:21.091 --> 54:23.685
I can see her now
through the window

54:23.760 --> 54:26.923
telling her grandpapa
how to plant tomatoes.

54:26.997 --> 54:28.589
I'm worried about her teeth.

54:28.665 --> 54:32.465
Father thinks she should wear
one of those wire things.

54:32.535 --> 54:37.029
And that hulking boy is Desmond.
9 years old yesterday.

54:37.107 --> 54:40.042
The village is livelier
than it's ever been.

54:40.110 --> 54:42.203
We have a large contingent
of evacuees

54:42.279 --> 54:45.248
and a lot of other visitors
that come and go.

54:45.315 --> 54:48.045
Everything's changed and yet
nothing's changed.

54:48.118 --> 54:50.518
There's the whistle
of the 4:35.

54:50.587 --> 54:52.680
Half an hour late as usual.

54:52.756 --> 54:55.850
Mrs. Trusket still serves
her homemade toffee.

54:55.925 --> 54:59.588
Where she manages to get
the sugar from, I can't imagine.

54:59.663 --> 55:02.131
And there's still cricket
on Saturday afternoon.

55:48.345 --> 55:50.279
Oh, what a kick in the pants

55:50.347 --> 55:51.780
that turned out to be.

55:51.848 --> 55:53.440
5 times more officers
than other ranks

55:53.516 --> 55:55.541
and they have to knock
the stuffing out of us.

55:55.618 --> 55:57.449
It was a mistake having Longarm too
close to the wire.

55:57.520 --> 55:58.953
If he has to run back to take a catch,

55:59.022 --> 56:00.114
- he's had it.
- Yeah.

56:00.190 --> 56:01.487
Do you know what the
Jerries want for a new ball?.

56:01.558 --> 56:02.957
- What?.
- 500 cigarettes.

56:03.026 --> 56:03.958
Sheer blackmail.

56:04.027 --> 56:05.289
Oh, I think it's worth it

56:05.362 --> 56:06.954
if this marvelous weather
continues.

56:07.030 --> 56:10.124
I wonder if they've been having
an early spring at home.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.930
"The apple trees are in
full blossom already,

56:13.002 --> 56:18.099
"making the orchard
look like a sheet of freezing snow.

56:18.174 --> 56:20.904
"And 1 0-Acre Meadow
is all white, too.

56:20.977 --> 56:22.308
"Because this year,

56:22.379 --> 56:26.372
"that's where the ewes are
pastured with their lambs.

56:26.449 --> 56:29.646
"Soon the garden will
be filled with the scent

56:29.719 --> 56:31.653
"and color of the May.

56:31.721 --> 56:34.246
"And beyond the river,

56:34.324 --> 56:38.522
"you can see the first
vivid green of the larches

56:38.595 --> 56:42.395
"and the bluebell wood."

56:53.843 --> 56:55.708
- Ted?.
- Yeah?.

56:55.779 --> 56:57.679
Remember that redhead
I told you about?.

56:57.747 --> 57:00.011
Let's see, is that your
own true dream girl lovey pie

57:00.083 --> 57:01.983
Or cheerio, toots?.

57:02.051 --> 57:03.382
It's my steady.

57:03.453 --> 57:05.853
She says the works manager's
fallen for her.

57:05.922 --> 57:07.287
Says he s a key man.

57:07.357 --> 57:09.848
Sounds like one of them
backdoor key men to me.

57:09.926 --> 57:11.359
You and your pinup girls.

57:11.428 --> 57:14.363
My pinup's Tessie O'Shea,
with a...

57:14.431 --> 57:15.591
Yeah, but in my experience--

57:15.665 --> 57:16.859
Your experience?.

57:16.933 --> 57:19.333
God blarmy, one sniff
of a barmaid's apron,

57:19.402 --> 57:21.199
and you'd be on your knees,
sonny boy.

57:21.271 --> 57:22.533
That's all you know.

57:22.605 --> 57:24.596
Teach you
a thing or two.

57:26.109 --> 57:29.203
What's the matter, Ted?.
Bad news?.

57:29.279 --> 57:31.474
Ted?.

57:32.849 --> 57:34.612
Blimey, I never saw that one.

57:34.684 --> 57:37.050
Hey, my old woman's
got on the buses.

57:37.120 --> 57:38.553
Oh, you'll be walking the kids
when you get home.

57:38.621 --> 57:40.714
If we get home.

57:40.790 --> 57:43.953
It's a firm stand
I'm gonna take.

57:44.027 --> 57:46.291
The rest of them
you can eat,

57:46.362 --> 57:48.159
but not Lili Marleen.

57:48.231 --> 57:52.224
She's got such
a trusting look in her eye.

57:52.302 --> 57:57.569
Besides, next winter
I shall use her as a hot water bottle.

57:57.640 --> 58:00.006
I've had a letter.

58:00.076 --> 58:03.910
Amazing.
Perhaps there's one for me

58:03.980 --> 58:05.413
With news
of the baby.

58:05.482 --> 58:07.575
No letter for you.

58:07.650 --> 58:09.413
There is news.

58:09.486 --> 58:11.351
Flora's all right?.

58:11.421 --> 58:13.252
Not Ann-Marie?.

58:13.323 --> 58:14.950
She's okay.

58:15.024 --> 58:17.788
Letter's from her.

58:17.861 --> 58:21.991
"It's a baby girl.
She's doing nice.

58:22.065 --> 58:24.932
Until its..."

58:25.001 --> 58:29.461
You'll have it
sooner or later.

58:29.539 --> 58:33.771
Seems that doctor warned
her about it being dangerous,

58:33.843 --> 58:37.108
Because of her age.

58:37.180 --> 58:39.512
She wouldn't be put off.

58:39.582 --> 58:42.642
Flo was with her
at the end.

58:42.719 --> 58:45.279
It was all over
quite quick.

58:45.355 --> 58:51.089
Flo's gonna look
after the baby until you get back.

59:08.378 --> 59:09.640
The play's the thing.

59:09.712 --> 59:13.148
We're in our catch
the conscience of the king.

59:13.216 --> 59:15.013
Well, what happens
in the end?.

59:15.084 --> 59:17.575
Do they thump the
dirty old basket off?.

59:17.654 --> 59:19.849
Well, there's a sort of
all-round massacre,

59:19.923 --> 59:21.481
And Hamlet gets killed
himself.

59:21.558 --> 59:22.991
That's gangster stuff.

59:23.059 --> 59:24.651
The old boy certainly
knew his onion.

59:24.727 --> 59:26.524
You wait till we get to
"Richard lll."

59:26.596 --> 59:28.860
There's a murder
on practically every page.

59:28.932 --> 59:31.162
You're getting pretty hot
at this business, David.

59:31.234 --> 59:34.829
Oh, it's easy. But I'm still terrible
clumsy with my hands.

59:34.904 --> 59:36.838
Oh, I don't know about that.

59:36.906 --> 59:38.737
That tobacco pouch you made
was a smashing job.

59:38.808 --> 59:41.003
I've got sort of used to it now.

59:41.077 --> 59:43.011
And, well, you've all been so...

59:43.079 --> 59:44.512
You get on with your reading.

59:44.581 --> 59:46.173
I want to know
what happens next.

59:46.249 --> 59:47.739
Right.

59:49.252 --> 59:53.712
Celia, your letter has arrived
with the photographs.

59:53.790 --> 59:55.553
They're in front of me
as I write.

59:55.625 --> 59:58.025
You ask me to describe
our life here

59:58.094 --> 01:00:01.530
so that you may picture it
in your imagination.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:05.534
From where I sit,
I can hear the sound of a piano.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.366
It is my friend Stephen Harley.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:11.373
I wish you could hear
this music,

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.534
for it describes our life here

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:16.374
better than I could ever do
with words.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:19.540
It tells of men emerging
from the twilight.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:22.380
Turning their faces inward.
through wire.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:26.513
Creating in miniature
a world of their own.

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:31.558
It tells of men who have
come to terms with the present

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:35.564
and find it far from empty.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.725
Men who no longer lie down
to fate

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.233
but face it.

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:43.134
And find their own ways of beating it.

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:59.506
All this goes to make up
the picture of our life here,

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:01.914
made bearable only by
the letters and parcels

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.042
we receive from home.

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:07.647
They keep our bodies
and our faith alive.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.783
And that is true not only of us

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:12.885
here in our little wired
enclosed cinder patch,

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:16.227
but also of the scores of
other camps throughout Germany.

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:19.666
Great sprawling towns
of 20,000 men

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:24.935
or hamlets of a few hundred,
each a little piece of England.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:33.014
Months pass and my thoughts
are constantly of you, Celia.

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:37.610
Summer gives place to autumn,
autumn to winter.

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:39.951
Another Christmas
come and gone.

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:42.354
Another batch of prisoners
to swell our numbers.

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:44.689
They don't make the housing
problem any easier.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:48.697
They bring us eagerly awaited
news of the outside world.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.756
A little while ago there was
a rumor

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:52.698
that some of us
were to be repatriated.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:55.329
I allowed myself to dream

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:57.372
that these letters of ours
could come to life.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.932
I could see with my own eyes
your home, the children,

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:02.875
Yourself.

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:05.379
But the commission
never came.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:06.881
Were we forgotten?.

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:10.282
Or was it just
one more reprisal?.

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.947
Being they are prisoners,

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:15.456
this practice must come to rest.

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:18.494
Orders.

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:23.225
Finally,
the recent operation...

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:28.532
As a reprisal for such
an unwarranted action,

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:34.304
All British prisoners of war
of cellblock 27

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:38.040
until further notice
remain manacled

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:41.049
from dawn until dusk.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.848
Brigade dismissed.
Carry on.

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:20.116
Cigarette?.

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:22.657
Thanks.

01:04:22.725 --> 01:04:25.216
It's easy.
Sardine key.

01:04:25.294 --> 01:04:27.091
Turn to the right.

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:28.960
Turn to the left.

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.293
Bob's your uncle.

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:32.391
All part of the
Red Cross service.

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:34.197
Ha ha!

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:38.339
Our third winter
is approaching

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:40.807
bringing with it a new enemy.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:44.836
It's not the duration
but the indefiniteness.

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:47.644
But if a man knew the length
of his sentence,

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:50.151
he could plan accordingly.

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:52.483
Afterwards in our memories,

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:54.819
we shall relive
only the sunny days

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.324
or pleasant scenes,

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:59.259
a freedom of mind
and the comradeship.

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:02.559
We shall forget the wet days,
the wet weeks.

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:05.328
Those days when it seemed
an effort to do nothing

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:08.632
and our bunks were
the only release.

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:11.002
Deep down in the hearts
of all of us,

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:13.166
there dwells a lonely ache,

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:16.643
a desperate yearning
for those we love

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:21.046
and a fear, fear of becoming
forgotten men.

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:25.186
Write to me
again soon, Celia.

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:27.518
You could never know
how great the comfort is

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.490
that your letters
bring to me.

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:31.025
They're more than comforting.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:35.530
They give me strength
and hope and happiness.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:38.260
You will never know how much
they mean to me.

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:44.038
Oh, my dear, I am so terribly
moved by the way you write.

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:50.067
Is it too late to recapture
the happiness or our best years together?.

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:57.211
I have no place
in your past or your future, Celia.

01:05:57.286 --> 01:05:59.379
You must think of your husband
as dead.

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:01.548
This is good-bye.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:05.958
I understand.
Don't be afraid.

01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:08.690
I'll help you back.

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:11.392
I'll give you back
your strength,

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:15.870
the strength you've given to me
writing to me through these dark years.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.934
I'll wait for you.

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:09.017
Fortresses.

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:11.582
They'll soon
be able to see the channel.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:15.027
They'll be home
in time for tea.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:33.311
That's exactly 157
pounds you owe me.

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:35.316
Cut you through the pack.
Double or quit.

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:36.817
Not on your life.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.319
I've got me old age
to think of.

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:39.786
Blood sucker.

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:42.983
Oh, well, there goes
my gratuity.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.323
Cheap enough
to pass the time.

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:48.158
Funny how much you learn about time
when you're killing it.

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:49.925
Such as what?.

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:53.264
I've got a theory that
everything that counts

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:55.326
Is done by busy people.

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:56.462
When you've got
too little time,

01:07:56.539 --> 01:07:57.767
it's extraordinary
what you can do with it.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.501
And when you've got
all the time in the world,

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:01.873
Iike us, you don't do
a damn thing.

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:05.607
That's it, doc, you're becoming
quite a philosopher in your old age.

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:08.343
Why not?. The war hasn't exactly
chosen us to be heroes.

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:11.250
I know exactly what
I'm going to do with my time right now.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.185
I'm going to climb
into my bunk

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:16.019
and do absolutely
nothing till supper.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:20.028
They're talking about
tiram for the derby this year.

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:23.031
It'll be the fourth
derby I've missed.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:27.559
4 derbies. That's a hell
of a lot of time.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:31.697
With nothing up
or down on the books to show for it.

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:42.350
Bloody leeks again
this year, Donny?.

01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:44.886
I was thinking
of trying some asparagus.

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:47.889
Asparagus?.
That takes 7 years a crop.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.219
Aye.

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:51.384
I don't give it more
than another year myself.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.894
Another year?.

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:56.830
With it will be 4.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:59.390
Flo's hair has gone
all white, she says.

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:01.402
Everything's changing.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.495
Do you think we'll
be able to pick it up?.

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:05.335
The business
and everything?.

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:08.671
Search me. We're not
as young as we were, Donny.

01:09:08.743 --> 01:09:12.372
No, Ted, we're not
as young as we were.

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:16.946
Surely they'll invade soon.

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:19.249
Yeah, that's what
you said last year.

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:20.754
And the year before.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.415
What, it's the holiday list?.

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:25.756
Yeah, it's there
for all of us. 1 949.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:28.694
I wrote that
for Caroline.

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:32.756
Somehow it expressed
what I felt when I first met her.

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.598
It was after a concert.

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:36.103
There weren't any taxis.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.470
We walked back
across the park.

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.236
After a bit,
it began to rain.

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:44.268
So I carried her
on my shoulders.

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:46.176
You're still in love
with her, aren't you?.

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:49.274
I've tried to shut her
out of my thoughts completely.

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:53.879
But I can't.
I long for her all the time.

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:57.119
I'm a bigger fool
than you are.

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:59.286
Falling in love
with a photograph.

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.454
A dream.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:06.092
And a home
in a strange land.

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:07.965
Achtung!

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.971
Oh, carry on.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.269
Good afternoon,
gentlemen.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:13.603
Oh, please,
do carry on.

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:16.304
Each time I visit
this camp,

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:18.471
I'm intrigued as
to where we met before.

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:20.412
But now I think
I know the answer.

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:24.145
Your name wasn't always
Geoffrey Mitchell.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.154
Your identification
photograph is being sent

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:29.419
To Gestapo headquarters
in Berlin.

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:32.483
They have a large collection
of photographs there.

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:36.224
It will be interesting
to make comparisons.

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:41.293
I suppose it had to come.

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.861
They always catch up
with you in the end.

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:46.567
Repatriation, fellas!
Repatriation!

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:50.345
Great news, gentlemen,
great news! Repatriation!

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:52.539
And this time
it's the real McCoy.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.381
The thing that makes me mouth water,
real live girls.

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:58.010
Hundreds of 'em,
all lining up waiting for me.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:02.183
Bipeds, old boy, furnished with
two of practically everything!

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:05.125
A mixed German and Swiss
medical commission

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:08.527
will examine all those whose
names are down for repatriation.

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:12.192
Apparently it's a rush job,
so anybody who gets his ticket

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.735
will leave in a week's time.

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:16.703
So you've got a chance.

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.364
Yes.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.534
But we must have positive evidence
to justify repatriation.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:22.872
Of course.

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:25.038
Ah. Anything else,
Corporal?.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.048
Well, sir,
every time I breathe,

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:29.607
I can feel me liver
knocking up against me kidneys.

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:32.210
Come here.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.550
Cough, please.

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:36.489
Cough?. Blimey, do you want me
to bring up my appendix?.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:39.784
Yah.

01:11:44.533 --> 01:11:45.898
You have passed.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:47.230
Thank you, sir.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:48.292
Matthews.

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:50.304
I wonder if you'll
get through.

01:11:50.372 --> 01:11:52.704
Hello, Evans.
You'll soon be seeing your youngster.

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:53.571
Yes, indeed.

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:55.405
I'm sorry to
hear about you

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:57.069
And Captain Grayson, sir.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.171
Oh, well, the flat racing
season's over.

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:00.738
Do you know that Swiss fellow
actually had the nerve

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:02.249
to congratulate me
on my fitness.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:03.751
Ha ha! Well?.

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:05.548
- I got my ticket, all right.
- Fine.

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:07.213
You have passed.

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:09.382
Suits me, sir.

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:14.258
Captain Mitchell.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:21.060
Ah.

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:23.934
You need not strip,
Captain Mitchell.

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:25.598
I regret your case
is deferred

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:29.337
until the next board
in 6 months' time.

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:34.948
Morris.

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:36.279
And once it's discovered
he's not Mitchell,

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:37.785
he's sunk.
They'll have no mercy.

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:39.286
We've got to
do something for him.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.583
Yes, but what?.

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:42.419
Excuse me, sir.
Can we put up a scheme to you?.

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:43.788
Sure. Sit down.

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:45.121
What's it all about?.

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.627
We know the spot
Captain Mitchell's in.

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:48.754
We thought we'd fix up a stunt
to get him out of here.

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:50.298
What's the scheme?.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:51.890
Well, sir, there's
a list of bloke for repatriation

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:53.127
In the commandant's office.

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.464
We thought if
we could get hold of it,

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:55.468
alter the names...

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:56.469
Stage a break-in, sir.

01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:57.630
Hear, hear, hold on.

01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:58.798
We aren't professional burglars.

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:00.136
Well, yes, sir,
as a matter of fact,

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:01.301
well, I was.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:04.403
Were you really?.
Well, how awfully interesting.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.812
Commandant's office--
only one wire to cut.

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:09.043
Yes, but what about
the perimeter lights?.

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.483
They always put them out
when there's an air raid.

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:12.884
And they've been as
regular as clockwork lately.

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:14.479
Gosh, I believe
we've got something.

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:15.648
Suppose we do
get the list. What then?.

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:16.986
I can type.

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.321
Scratch out one of
the names beginning with M

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:19.486
and type Mitchell's
on instead.

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:20.653
Just a minute.
Don't you see,

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:23.425
the chap whose name goes off
has to stay behind.

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:25.831
Well, uh, my name
begins with M, sir.

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:28.802
You'd really give up
your ticket home?.

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:30.395
Why not?.

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:31.996
But I thought
all the girls were lining up

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.166
for you to come home?.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.903
Well, so they are.

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:36.069
But they'll wait.

01:13:36.145 --> 01:13:37.669
You are a sportsman.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.338
Gentleman,
we'll have a snack.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:42.509
Now, as I see it,
the drill is this...

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:17.718
My eyes are clear,
I cannot see

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:22.280
I have not brought my--

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:30.392
Here come the boys.
Bang on the dot.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:31.558
What do you mean?.

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:33.123
Well, just another raid,
old boy.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:37.731
All right, chaps,
lights out and sing out.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.420
Well, they had
better start.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:55.651
I know. God bless
the R.A. F.

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:05.055
Here he is.

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:07.192
Good boy.
Look out!

01:15:58.687 --> 01:16:00.848
All clear.

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:51.468
That's the lock
you've got to pick.

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.038
Good, there's a typewriter.

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:00.706
Get down!

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.715
Type on the floor.

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:07.885
It's tougher than I thought.

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.583
Let me try.

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.055
Must be a bit out of practice.

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.155
I'll say.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.904
Good, this is it.

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:51.991
Sing, you so-and-sos, sing!

01:17:59.107 --> 01:18:01.166
- That'll do.
- Come on.

01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:28.795
That'll fool 'em.

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:31.304
Let's split up and get back
to our own huts.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:32.362
Ok, sir.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:53.660
What's going on?.

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:54.991
You're not supposed
to know.

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:56.325
The boys were out there
putting your name

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:57.387
on the repatriation list.

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:22.521
Darn.

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:48.306
You will all remain here
until the other huts have been checked!

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:11.395
Permission to go home, sir?.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:15.603
Yes, provided you put
a... for me.

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:17.076
It's you that ought
to be going home.

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:19.010
Oh, don't you believe it.

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.809
I'm a social parasite.

01:20:20.882 --> 01:20:22.873
The sort we're fighting
to get rid of.

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:24.441
That's right.
I've got to stay here

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:25.451
and exterminate him.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.750
Ha ha.
Go slow with the...

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:29.051
Don't forget
to save a couple of

01:20:29.124 --> 01:20:30.853
peach-fed blondes
for your Uncle Jim.

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:31.858
That's a promise.

01:20:31.927 --> 01:20:33.417
Oh, I was kidding.

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:35.929
You're one of those
one-woman blokes, aren't you?.

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.521
Yes, that's my trouble.

01:20:37.599 --> 01:20:39.760
Sorry, then.
Always putting my foot in it.

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:41.393
Don't forget to tell the girls round
Hammersmith Way

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:43.061
that I'll be home
soon and I've got

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:44.469
plenty saved up
to give them a treat with.

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:45.506
Yeah, you bet.

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:47.201
I'm gonna keep
my job warm for you.

01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:49.175
Horsfall, Evans,
and Mathews.

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:50.302
Unlimited.

01:20:53.248 --> 01:20:55.546
Hello, Mathews.
Feeling all right?.

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:56.743
Yes, it's all right, sir.

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:58.683
I was a sissy
passing out like that.

01:20:58.753 --> 01:21:00.550
I can never thank you
for what you've done.

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.613
Well, forget it. Just keep your head
down on the parade

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:03.817
And pop your uncle.

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:05.723
- Thanks.
- Don't worry, sir.

01:21:05.794 --> 01:21:07.022
You'll get through all right.

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:08.585
We'll be right
behind you, sir.

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:14.965
One other thing.
What about the German M.O.?.

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:16.060
He's certain
to be on parade,

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:17.661
and he's more likely
than anyone

01:21:17.739 --> 01:21:19.400
To remember that
Mitchell's name wasn't on the list.

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:20.941
I know.
I've thought of that.

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:22.601
I'm going to start up
a conversation with him

01:21:22.677 --> 01:21:23.974
while they're
calling the names.

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:25.910
He only speaks
about a dozen words in English.

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:27.573
You leave it to me.

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:29.742
Hello, David, my boy.

01:21:29.818 --> 01:21:33.185
Good-bye
and good luck.

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:37.055
Good-bye, sir,
and thank you all.

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:39.320
See you again before
you know where you are.

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:42.056
- Yes.
- Come on, David.

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:43.927
Don't forget.
We've got a bridge date tonight.

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:45.830
Don't forget the cigarettes
you owe me, padre.

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:47.459
Play you a double
at quits tonight, jim.

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:48.695
Ambrose.

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:51.297
Anderson.

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:54.866
Burns.

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:58.174
There are a lot of
things I'd like to say, but--

01:21:58.246 --> 01:21:59.406
But I can't.

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:02.416
Go on.
Off you go.

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:05.180
Good-bye.
Good luck.

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:07.380
- So long, old boy.
- Good luck.

01:22:07.455 --> 01:22:09.389
Keep out of
the German M.O.'s eyeline.

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:12.159
Grant.

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:14.554
Hanley.

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:17.123
Hunt.

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:21.033
Horsfall.

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:22.433
Jackson.

01:22:23.738 --> 01:22:25.069
Jessop.

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:28.772
How soon do you think
the war will end now, doctor?.

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:31.437
6 months or one year
if you're light.

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:33.378
By then, you'll be
speaking fluent English.

01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:35.382
You think I've made
good progression?.

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:37.350
Oh, terrific.
Ha ha.

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:38.351
Yes, you Germans
certainly have

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.387
the gift for languages.

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:40.421
You think so.

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:42.479
Of course.
Yes. Ha ha.

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:44.388
After the war,
they make me

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:46.188
headmaster of
Oxford University.

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:49.189
Mitchell.

01:22:53.368 --> 01:22:54.392
Miter.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.702
Acton. Ashe.

01:24:03.471 --> 01:24:08.033
For the gang's all here

01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:37.130
I'm sorry, madam,
but you can't go in.

01:24:37.205 --> 01:24:38.832
I must.
It's my husband.

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:39.896
Please.

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:50.643
Excuse me.

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:54.044
Excuse me.

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:13.731
What's happened to
the iron gate, Mother?.

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:16.827
It went for salvage
2 years ago.

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:18.736
I'll miss the squeaking
of that old gate.

01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:21.708
Have there been
any other changes?.

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:24.836
No. I kept your room
exactly as it was

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:26.437
the day you went off
to France.

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:32.148
Same old smell.

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:34.381
Sunlight, soap,
and furniture polish.

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:37.816
You come in here
for a minute

01:26:37.892 --> 01:26:39.792
and I'll get you
something to eat.

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:49.967
David.

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:52.934
Elspeth.

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:57.305
That last letter.

01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:00.576
Your mother showed me.

01:27:00.648 --> 01:27:04.106
Telling the truth
about your eyes.

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:05.880
So that was the reason.

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:08.149
The reason for what?.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:10.191
For breaking
our engagement.

01:27:10.258 --> 01:27:12.658
But you can't go on
being engaged

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:14.627
when you're not
in love any longer.

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:16.721
You can't go on breaking
a person's heart

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:19.358
to satisfy your own
stupid pride.

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:21.197
I'm not prepared
to discuss the matter.

01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:24.705
Neither am l.
David...

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:29.701
Why did you have to make me
so dreadfully unhappy?.

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:00.699
Caroline.

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:04.536
But--but what are you--

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.341
There were some things
I left behind.

01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:09.778
Caretaker let me in.

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:11.546
I had no idea.

01:28:14.989 --> 01:28:16.081
I'll go now.

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:19.820
Caroline.

01:28:19.894 --> 01:28:21.691
Yes, Stephen?.

01:28:21.763 --> 01:28:23.993
Are you all right?.

01:28:27.168 --> 01:28:28.567
Why are you crying?.

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:32.736
Because I'm a fool.

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:35.776
Are you unhappy
with Robert?.

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:38.711
I'm not with Robert.

01:28:40.415 --> 01:28:41.677
Oh, Stephen.

01:28:42.884 --> 01:28:44.818
Why did you have to
believe that idiot?.

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:49.017
It wasn't true?.
It wasn't true?.

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:51.650
No. Not then.

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.684
Go on.

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:56.129
When I got your letter,
it was as if

01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:59.064
all I'd ever believed in
didn't exist anymore.

01:28:59.133 --> 01:29:01.226
I didn't care
what happened.

01:29:01.302 --> 01:29:02.894
He was in love
with you?.

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:04.369
Yes.

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:05.497
And you?.

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:07.630
No.

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:10.834
Let me go now.
Please.

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:14.639
Listen, Caroline.

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:16.877
There, everything
seemed so--

01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:18.919
so out of proportion.

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.920
I think I was mad
for a bit.

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:23.855
You see, I loved you
so desperately.

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:25.790
Still do.

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.384
Always shall.

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:28.451
Stephen.

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:43.599
Thanks, mate.

01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:47.536
Thanks.

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:49.378
Well, this is it, Don.

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:50.474
Yes.

01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:51.483
How do you feel?.

01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:53.645
Empty.
Empty inside.

01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:56.519
Me, too, like it wasn't me
standing here at all.

01:29:56.591 --> 01:29:58.354
Come on, Don.
Let's get weaving.

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:17.133
Hello, old girl.

01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:19.502
Hello, Ted.

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:23.049
Doing you all right?.

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:25.680
I'm seasick.

01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:29.185
Stomach always was
your weakness.

01:30:33.828 --> 01:30:35.523
Suits you.

01:30:35.596 --> 01:30:36.858
Oh, Ted.

01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:38.159
There, there.

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:41.959
I can't leave don out
in the cold like that.

01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:44.096
Oh, don.

01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:45.104
Hello, flo.

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:46.765
Oh, it's lovely
to see you.

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:48.035
Come on in.

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:55.672
- Where is she?.
- In here.

01:31:13.734 --> 01:31:14.826
Hello, Gwyneth.

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:16.267
Hello.

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:17.634
Do you know who I am?.

01:31:17.705 --> 01:31:19.332
Yes. You're my
Daddy, aren't you?.

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:22.274
That's it.
Look.

01:31:22.343 --> 01:31:24.402
I made this in
the prison camp for you.

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:27.972
Can she shut her eyes?.

01:31:28.049 --> 01:31:29.414
No, she can't.

01:31:30.885 --> 01:31:32.375
My doll can.

01:31:32.453 --> 01:31:33.681
She's lovely.

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:39.817
So that's settled.

01:31:39.894 --> 01:31:41.384
Captain Hasek
reports to duty

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:43.327
to Czech headquarters.

01:31:43.397 --> 01:31:45.991
There was something
I wanted to ask, sir.

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:47.056
About Mrs. Mitchell.

01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:48.931
Oh, yes.
Very awkward, of course.

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:50.334
Don't worry, Captain Hasek.

01:31:50.404 --> 01:31:52.304
We've got that
matter in hand.

01:31:52.373 --> 01:31:53.533
I wanted
to suggest, sir,

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:54.734
as it's my responsibility,

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:57.676
that if the notification
of her husband's death

01:31:57.745 --> 01:31:59.906
could be delayed until I've seen
Mrs. Mitchell myself.

01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:02.211
She'll have to be told through
the usual channels, you know.

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:04.046
Yes, sir, but in
a case like this, it's--

01:32:04.118 --> 01:32:06.086
War office will
look after it.

01:32:06.153 --> 01:32:08.121
Or if you like,
go down and see her yourself.

01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:09.486
There's nothing
to stop you.

01:32:09.557 --> 01:32:10.581
I see.

01:32:11.926 --> 01:32:12.915
Thank you, sir.

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:19.291
Looks like rain.

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:25.969
My dear.
It's no good going on hoping.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.371
You must face up to it.

01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:31.073
That he won't come back?.

01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:32.578
That he won't come back.

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:40.545
Grandpa. It's
starting to rain.

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:42.987
Come help me put the chairs
in the summer house.

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:44.524
Oh, come on.

01:33:01.909 --> 01:33:02.898
Oh.

01:33:04.078 --> 01:33:07.741
I'm sorry.
I was expecting someone else.

01:33:07.815 --> 01:33:09.305
Mrs. Mitchell,
I came to see you.

01:33:09.383 --> 01:33:12.045
I have some news for you,

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:13.143
of your husband.

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:16.712
Oh.

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:18.948
Come in, please.

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:30.693
What?.

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:34.334
Your husband is dead.

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:38.267
Dead?.

01:33:39.747 --> 01:33:41.146
He was killed 4 years ago

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:43.445
in the fighting at Saint-Ardennie.

01:33:43.517 --> 01:33:46.953
I heard from him.
From the prison camp.

01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:50.520
Your husband was never
in that prison camp.

01:33:50.591 --> 01:33:52.616
He was never
a prisoner of war.

01:33:52.693 --> 01:33:54.888
But--the letters.

01:33:54.962 --> 01:33:56.759
I wrote those letters.

01:33:58.699 --> 01:33:59.791
You?.

01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:00.856
Yes.

01:34:03.104 --> 01:34:04.765
But l--

01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:06.807
I took these from
your husband's body.

01:34:06.874 --> 01:34:10.674
I took his name,
his uniform, his identity.

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:15.979
For 4 years, I've been
Geoffrey Mitchell.

01:34:21.055 --> 01:34:22.044
But why?.

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:24.852
To save my life.

01:34:24.925 --> 01:34:26.256
The Germans
were after me.

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:28.689
The letters?.

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:30.196
Later in the camp,
I had to write.

01:34:30.264 --> 01:34:31.731
They suspected me.

01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:32.823
If I hadn't answered
your letters,

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.800
they'd have been
on to me.

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:37.064
You had to answer
my letters.

01:34:37.138 --> 01:34:38.799
I understand that.
You--

01:34:39.907 --> 01:34:42.000
You even had
to go on writing.

01:34:42.076 --> 01:34:43.509
I understand that, too.

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:48.511
Why did you have
to write the way you did?.

01:34:51.652 --> 01:34:54.143
I believed
every word you said.

01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:56.781
At first, I had
to make you tell me

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:58.256
as much as possible
about yourself.

01:34:59.493 --> 01:35:00.721
I was fighting
for my life.

01:35:02.663 --> 01:35:03.721
And then...

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.868
I got your other letters.

01:35:07.935 --> 01:35:09.527
Photos of the children.

01:35:12.907 --> 01:35:15.171
Glimpses of things lost
to me forever and...

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:19.938
It was as if you were
offering me a new world.

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:25.682
It was easy out there
to delude oneself.

01:35:27.188 --> 01:35:29.383
And I believed
a wonderful thing had happened.

01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:32.124
My husband had left me.

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:36.596
And those letters made me believe
he was mine again,

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:39.098
That everything would be
as I'd hoped it would be.

01:35:40.935 --> 01:35:43.130
I planned for the day
he'd come home again...

01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:46.105
For a new life together.

01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:50.838
What a fool I was.

01:35:51.946 --> 01:35:53.038
You were still
in love with him?.

01:35:55.015 --> 01:35:56.915
How I can tell now?.

01:35:58.619 --> 01:36:00.917
I know there's no excuse
for what I did, but--

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:03.752
Will you go now, please?.

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:07.123
You must believe that
I meant what I wrote.

01:36:07.194 --> 01:36:10.288
Your letters came
to be my life.

01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:13.356
You see, I fell
in love with you.

01:36:14.401 --> 01:36:19.168
It was a dream then.
Now it's reality.

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:06.151
I allowed myself to dream

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.314
these letters of ours
could come to life.

01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:12.154
That I could see with my own
eyes your home,

01:37:12.226 --> 01:37:15.354
the children, yourself.

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:01.773
Celia, you're wanted
on the telephone.

01:38:01.842 --> 01:38:03.002
Who is it?.

01:38:03.077 --> 01:38:04.510
Captain Hasek.
