Eat!

02:14.470 --> 02:15.470
Baby?

02:16.876 --> 02:17.876
Babe, are you okay?

02:19.580 --> 02:20.739
- Yeah.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.559
Yeah, it was just a dream.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.300
You're sweating, are
you sure you're okay?

02:26.433 --> 02:27.433
- Yeah.

02:28.260 --> 02:29.260
Yeah.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.619
- Well, dinner's ready.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.969
Alright, cool.

02:33.970 --> 02:35.870
- Alright, hurry
up, get changed.

02:50.620 --> 02:51.920
- This looks great, honey.

02:52.970 --> 02:54.129
- Happy birthday.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.929
- Hooray, I'm officially old.

02:56.930 --> 02:59.179
- 30 is not old.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.580
- Let's see how you
feel about that

03:00.604 --> 03:03.039
a couple years from
now when you turn 30.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.190
- Are you gonna be this
grumpy all weekend?

03:06.333 --> 03:07.666
- No, I'm sorry.

03:13.404 --> 03:16.800
Ah, I know that face,
what's wrong Super Hulk?

03:17.790 --> 03:18.790
- It's stupid.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.120
- Tell me, I like stupid stuff.

03:26.490 --> 03:28.380
- I told you about
my birth mother

03:30.020 --> 03:33.639
and how every year at this time

03:33.640 --> 03:35.240
I feel like she's gonna find me.

03:38.531 --> 03:42.980
You know, she's just
waiting to surprise me.

03:45.631 --> 03:46.714
I don't know,

03:48.258 --> 03:51.600
I just feel like turning 30

03:54.200 --> 03:57.590
that makes the dream seem
more and more impossible.

03:59.860 --> 04:02.020
- Maybe that's a good thing.

04:03.930 --> 04:06.139
- Your adoptive parents
love you, I love you.

04:06.140 --> 04:10.659
When you finally knock me up,
our children will love you.

04:10.660 --> 04:12.239
You have so much
love from the people

04:12.240 --> 04:15.719
that exist in your life
that maybe it's okay

04:15.720 --> 04:17.990
to leave this illusion
of your mother behind.

04:23.620 --> 04:26.620
30 could be a great new
chapter in your life.

04:28.750 --> 04:32.310
- Well you know, you
could go back to school.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.350
Maybe get a career.

04:38.170 --> 04:40.560
Imagine me going back to school.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.520
I know math.

04:46.730 --> 04:48.344
Yeah.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.328
- Hold it right
there, turn around.

05:18.232 --> 05:20.065
What do you got there?

05:20.990 --> 05:21.990
- Garbage.

05:25.523 --> 05:26.610
- For six months now.

05:30.726 --> 05:32.830
- Let's see what's in the bag.

05:37.645 --> 05:38.645
- Trash.

05:41.577 --> 05:43.239
- Alright.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.170
What's your name?

05:44.171 --> 05:45.230
- Lance O'Brien.

05:46.460 --> 05:47.460
- 99.

05:49.553 --> 05:50.553
- You have a nice night.

05:50.553 --> 05:51.553
- Mmhmm.

05:58.450 --> 06:00.250
- You know you have other
shirts you can pack.

06:00.274 --> 06:01.304
- I sure do.

06:04.076 --> 06:07.050
You cannot pack the
gun this time.

06:08.140 --> 06:09.180
- Don't be crazy.

06:10.900 --> 06:11.900
What if we need it?

06:13.140 --> 06:14.739
- Haven't ever needed it.

06:15.553 --> 06:16.553
Please?

06:16.553 --> 06:17.553
It's my birthday.

06:18.340 --> 06:19.639
- It's your birthday today,

06:19.640 --> 06:22.239
tomorrow, just
another camping day.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.769
- You know the damn
thing makes me nervous.

06:25.770 --> 06:27.669
- Oh, you're so white!

06:27.670 --> 06:32.639
- No, no if I was
white I'd love guns.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.909
But, however, I'm not.

06:34.910 --> 06:37.349
Those things have killed
thousands of my people.

06:37.350 --> 06:39.939
- A result of poverty
and lack of education,

06:39.940 --> 06:41.229
not the color of your skin.

06:41.230 --> 06:44.269
And it doesn't only
concern black people.

06:44.270 --> 06:45.959
Just admit that
your WASPy parents

06:45.960 --> 06:49.589
just drilled this
fear of gun into you.

06:49.590 --> 06:50.710
God.

06:51.543 --> 06:52.650
They wanted me to be safe.

06:54.490 --> 06:58.510
It's certainly better than
rollin' with the homies at 14.

06:59.670 --> 07:00.980
That's not safe.

07:00.981 --> 07:03.653
- At least they
taught me about life.

07:03.654 --> 07:05.670
I can hold my own
in any situation.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.849
What are you gonna do when we
get attacked by a wolf, huh?

07:09.850 --> 07:11.649
Huh, what your gonna
do, what you got?

07:11.650 --> 07:12.789
- I'll show you.

07:12.790 --> 07:14.830
What you got big boy?
- Step back and I'll show you.

07:14.854 --> 07:15.854
Step back.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.848
Kick it in the face.

07:20.860 --> 07:22.800
- You're such a dork.

07:24.050 --> 07:25.969
Alright, alright.

07:25.970 --> 07:26.970
All safe.

07:31.633 --> 07:32.633
Alright.

07:34.010 --> 07:36.999
This was my last
thing, I'm all set.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.750
Now, to your last present.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.500
Da, da, da, da, da.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.573
Would you like some
more, darling?

08:26.574 --> 08:27.574
- Please.

08:35.962 --> 08:37.294
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.

09:03.633 --> 09:04.633
- Kendra.

09:08.326 --> 09:09.326
My leg!

09:15.239 --> 09:16.322
Jesus Christ.

09:34.489 --> 09:36.072
What are you doing?

09:37.980 --> 09:39.490
- Just a bit of work.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.515
Bad dreams?

09:47.516 --> 09:48.516
- Yeah.

09:49.940 --> 09:52.229
- I really think you should
talk to somebody about this.

09:52.230 --> 09:54.689
You've been having a lot
of bad dreams lately.

09:54.690 --> 09:56.520
- I can handle it.

09:57.771 --> 10:01.749
- I'm sorry, I just, I gotta
put this brief together

10:01.750 --> 10:04.500
and then I'm gonna be free
for the rest of the weekend.

10:06.340 --> 10:07.340
No!

10:08.300 --> 10:10.790
Just an hour, I promise.

10:13.030 --> 10:16.299
It's actually a really
interesting case.

10:16.300 --> 10:21.110
So this guy, he embezzled
$250K from the company.

10:22.010 --> 10:24.959
Cut and dry, right?

10:24.960 --> 10:27.139
Huh, no.

10:27.140 --> 10:30.480
His boss left a paper
trail that we were...

10:34.017 --> 10:36.769
Alright, I know we
said we were gonna do

10:36.770 --> 10:38.199
this together tomorrow morning,

10:38.200 --> 10:41.759
but why don't you
choose a really nice

10:41.760 --> 10:45.910
camping site for us,
somewhere near water.

10:47.210 --> 10:51.790
Isolated, I wanna
swim naked this time.

How long since we got
off the highway?

12:57.170 --> 12:59.169
About seven and a half miles.

12:59.170 --> 13:02.089
Okay, so a little bit farther

13:02.090 --> 13:04.219
and then the turnoff
should be on your left.

13:04.220 --> 13:05.220
Oh, nice.

13:23.830 --> 13:25.049
- You really got us out into

13:25.050 --> 13:27.266
the middle of nowhere this time.

13:27.267 --> 13:29.840
- Well, I had to see you
swim naked in the river.

13:32.518 --> 13:35.185
Babe, could you grab me a water?

13:43.270 --> 13:44.270
Shit!

14:22.168 --> 14:23.418
- Come on, baby, wake up.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.130
We need to get him
to a hospital.

14:29.020 --> 14:32.989
- Oh, that's near
impossible up here.

14:32.990 --> 14:35.969
We don't have a
vehicle or nothing.

14:35.970 --> 14:37.859
Anyway, he's just
got a little bump

14:37.860 --> 14:39.650
on the noggin', same as you.

14:41.810 --> 14:42.810
- I hope so.

14:47.940 --> 14:49.240
Let me show you something.

14:57.010 --> 15:02.010
As I was saying, my name is
Mary and our home is your home.

15:04.440 --> 15:08.179
Now, me and my husband
Ivan sleep in that room

15:08.180 --> 15:12.619
and most everybody else sleeps
out here, except for Vlad.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.149
He's got his own shack out back.

15:15.150 --> 15:17.189
- Oh, he gets his own place.

15:17.190 --> 15:19.409
I guess he's pretty special.

15:19.410 --> 15:23.959
- Oh, yes, Vlad is going
to be the next leader.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.210
He needs his own
place to prepare.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.570
Come on, follow me, come on.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.180
This is the kitchen.

15:39.790 --> 15:41.150
This is my stove.

15:44.890 --> 15:46.340
This is my favorite pot.

15:47.690 --> 15:49.910
- Sounds like you spend
a lot of time in here.

15:56.170 --> 15:57.170
- I like your dress.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.100
- Why, thank you!

16:01.140 --> 16:04.419
Had it 40 years!

16:04.420 --> 16:05.849
Still looks like new.

16:05.850 --> 16:06.850
Don't you think?

16:18.620 --> 16:21.199
You want to wash up, the
river's down that way.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.480
- Oh no, no, I need
to um, you know.

16:28.133 --> 16:29.133
Okay.

16:37.432 --> 16:38.432
Here.

16:38.432 --> 16:39.432
- Thanks.

17:14.210 --> 17:15.210
Hello.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.289
- Good afternoon, darlin'.

17:18.290 --> 17:19.679
How you feeling?

17:19.680 --> 17:20.680
- Still woozy.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.368
- Good to see you up and around.

17:23.369 --> 17:25.069
You two hit that
tree pretty hard.

17:29.860 --> 17:32.060
- Big fella's out there
moving it right now.

17:32.970 --> 17:33.970
- Thanks.

17:35.290 --> 17:36.730
There was this thing
that popped out

17:36.754 --> 17:38.304
of the woods and made us crash.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.239
- Things happen, I guess.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.140
Now you go on inside
and take it easy.

18:34.901 --> 18:36.629
How's he doing?

18:36.630 --> 18:37.630
- The same.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.619
Thank you again for helping us.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.510
Oh, you're welcome!

18:45.000 --> 18:48.009
- Oh, better to be
safe than sorry.

18:48.010 --> 18:50.310
Dinner should be at 7 p.m.
sharp.

18:52.900 --> 18:54.469
- Hello.

18:54.470 --> 18:55.470
I'm Kendra.

18:57.030 --> 18:58.390
- I'm Caitlin.

18:59.260 --> 19:01.959
- Caitlin, that's a pretty name,

19:01.960 --> 19:03.110
for a very pretty girl.

19:07.870 --> 19:10.070
So what do you do for
fun out here, Caitlin?

19:11.240 --> 19:12.520
Do you go to school?

19:13.660 --> 19:17.419
- Oh, we teach our children
everything they need

19:17.420 --> 19:19.769
to know right here at
the old homestead.

19:19.770 --> 19:21.449
- Oh, you have other
children out here.

19:21.450 --> 19:24.219
- Oh yes, well, not now.

19:24.220 --> 19:26.819
Kids, they grow up,
they move out.

19:26.820 --> 19:27.653
- Sure.

19:27.654 --> 19:29.369
- But some of them stick around.

19:29.370 --> 19:31.459
Vlad will be back for supper.

19:31.460 --> 19:32.680
He's my oldest.

19:34.840 --> 19:39.840
Caitlin, honey, why don't
you go get a piece of meat?

19:49.150 --> 19:51.149
She's a little shy.

19:51.150 --> 19:52.510
But she's a good girl.

19:57.090 --> 19:58.749
Kendra?

19:58.750 --> 20:01.009
- Lance, oh my God.

20:01.010 --> 20:01.910
I was worried about you.

20:01.910 --> 20:02.750
Are you okay?

20:02.751 --> 20:03.800
I think so.

20:04.969 --> 20:05.969
How about you?

20:05.970 --> 20:08.710
- I'm fine, just a
little scraped up.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.769
- Uh, well Mary...

20:13.770 --> 20:16.209
I'm sorry, Mary, this is Lance.

20:16.210 --> 20:18.290
- Nice to meet you!

20:18.291 --> 20:20.349
You too.

20:20.350 --> 20:23.700
- Her family found our car and
they brought us here to rest.

20:27.260 --> 20:31.229
- Oh, this here is the
Polifer homestead.

20:31.230 --> 20:35.780
For nearly 150 years it's
been right on this spot.

20:39.780 --> 20:44.846
- Oh, well I don't know
about no geo-maferly.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.909
We're in the oak belt.

20:46.910 --> 20:50.689
We're in the shadow of
the great mountain.

20:50.690 --> 20:52.449
You're lucky we found you.

20:52.450 --> 20:55.170
We don't get but two strangers
a year around here.

20:58.960 --> 21:02.169
- Well, Polifers
keep to ourselves.

21:02.170 --> 21:04.070
It's been that way
from the beginning.

21:08.493 --> 21:09.722
So I can wash my face.

21:10.805 --> 21:11.869
Bathroom?

21:11.870 --> 21:13.970
We ain't got no bathroom.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.639
We got a river.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.540
It's right down the path to
your right, you can't miss it.

21:21.810 --> 21:25.169
Oh, would you mind picking up a
bucket of water on your way?

21:25.170 --> 21:26.170
- Sure.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.060
Be careful out there.

21:33.755 --> 21:35.160
- Dang, it's pretty.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.161
- I know.

21:39.108 --> 21:41.525
We need to get you washed up.

21:52.583 --> 21:54.232
So what do you think?

21:54.233 --> 21:56.605
What, about her?

21:56.606 --> 21:58.792
I think she's a little weird.

21:58.793 --> 22:00.089
No shit.

22:00.090 --> 22:02.660
This family's been living
alone for 150 years.

22:03.629 --> 22:05.489
That's a lot of inbreeding.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.323
I'm serious.

22:06.324 --> 22:08.310
Doesn't this place
make you feel uneasy?

22:09.950 --> 22:11.180
- Not really, no.

22:19.748 --> 22:21.150
Oh, shit that's cold!

22:22.390 --> 22:23.390
- Oh, Jesus!

22:25.600 --> 22:27.479
- Strip and jump in.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.790
- Get out, you idiot.

22:29.630 --> 22:31.889
Are you sure you're
feeling okay?

22:31.890 --> 22:34.609
- A little dizzy,
it comes and goes.

22:34.610 --> 22:36.760
- I know, but we need to
get you to a hospital.

22:39.610 --> 22:40.989
- I'm serious, you
know, one of us

22:40.990 --> 22:42.310
might actually
have a concussion.

22:42.334 --> 22:44.009
You don't want to
mess with those.

22:44.010 --> 22:46.855
- First of all, we don't
know what's up with the car.

22:46.856 --> 22:50.829
Secondly, the sun goes
down in about two hours.

22:50.830 --> 22:54.109
And it's not smart to
roam the woods busted

22:54.110 --> 22:57.910
and broken, alone,
lost, in the dark.

22:58.800 --> 22:59.800
- Come on.

23:09.839 --> 23:12.390
What the fuck was that?

23:12.391 --> 23:13.641
- I don't know.

23:15.602 --> 23:18.669
A noise, maybe a wild boar.

23:18.670 --> 23:21.166
Do they have those out here?

23:21.167 --> 23:22.167
- Probably.

23:26.050 --> 23:27.890
Let's go check on the car
and see about the gun

23:27.914 --> 23:29.154
just in case we need to use it.

23:39.390 --> 23:40.729
You brought it back here.

23:40.730 --> 23:41.563
Thank you!

23:41.563 --> 23:42.540
It wasn't easy.

23:42.541 --> 23:43.920
Vlad did most of the work.

23:49.270 --> 23:50.650
You couldn't drive it?

23:54.564 --> 23:56.964
- The radiator's got a
hole in it from the tree.

23:59.183 --> 24:00.183
- Oh, damn.

24:00.184 --> 24:02.550
- You're not gonna
drive it anytime soon.

24:05.020 --> 24:07.549
- Well, I could probably fix it.

24:07.550 --> 24:09.569
I'm good with mechanical stuff.

24:09.570 --> 24:10.570
That's why I'm here.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.440
- No, not that I can tell.

24:18.210 --> 24:20.459
- Three, four days.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.279
- Oh no, no, no, no, no.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.449
I gotta be at the
office Monday morning.

24:24.450 --> 24:26.229
- There's nothing I
can do about that.

24:26.230 --> 24:28.340
I gotta rebuild all the
wavy parts one at a time.

24:30.474 --> 24:33.120
- Like I said, I'm good
with mechanical stuff.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.210
- Hello.

24:42.211 --> 24:43.211
How you doing?

24:44.500 --> 24:46.330
Just gonna grab our...

24:52.915 --> 24:53.915
- Later.

25:52.944 --> 25:54.277
- Hello, family.

25:57.678 --> 26:01.589
So, these are our guests.

26:01.590 --> 26:02.590
- Yes.

26:03.430 --> 26:06.330
This is Lance and Kendra.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.949
And what brings you two
all the way up here?

26:11.950 --> 26:14.449
- We're just looking for a nice,

26:14.450 --> 26:17.389
quiet, nature-filled weekend.

26:17.390 --> 26:19.069
- Nature we've got.

26:19.070 --> 26:21.020
Quiet, not so much.

26:26.370 --> 26:30.300
- This place you have
here, it's very nice.

26:32.490 --> 26:36.270
- Um, living free
of society, that's,

26:37.400 --> 26:38.900
that's a great accomplishment.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.450
- We don't need your
approval, Lance.

26:45.220 --> 26:46.770
- I'm sorry, I was just...

26:48.170 --> 26:49.170
Hmm?

26:54.290 --> 26:55.590
- I didn't mean to offend.

26:57.271 --> 26:59.769
I'm just pulling your leg, son!

26:59.770 --> 27:03.010
I think it's great to have
some fresh meat in this house.

27:05.740 --> 27:07.999
So, from what Ramon tells me,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.289
you'll be with us
for a few days.

27:10.290 --> 27:11.440
- It would seem so.

27:14.710 --> 27:17.029
Hi, I don't believe we've met.

27:17.030 --> 27:18.030
I'm Kendra.

27:23.730 --> 27:27.450
Welcome to our home.

27:34.930 --> 27:35.930
- Leave her alone.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.819
- You're curious, I understand.

27:43.820 --> 27:46.269
I mean, what's a Negro doing

27:46.270 --> 27:47.940
with a bunch of
white folks, huh?

27:49.654 --> 27:51.269
Well, you see, we
do get visitors

27:51.270 --> 27:52.700
like yourself now and then.

27:54.360 --> 27:56.730
Must have been a hair
over 30 years ago.

27:57.720 --> 28:00.760
Ella found us, she was lost.

28:02.397 --> 28:05.610
Well, not just in the
forest, but in life.

28:06.910 --> 28:09.110
She felt outcast from
the world you live in.

28:10.050 --> 28:12.779
She would talk about
your keepers of the law,

28:12.780 --> 28:15.599
about the bigotry
in your society.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.910
After spending a few days
with us she decided to stay.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.115
- She clearly can't decide.

28:23.948 --> 28:24.948
- Hold on, Vlad.

28:25.990 --> 28:28.819
She didn't mean to
disrespect Ella.

28:28.820 --> 28:33.080
You see, just a few years after
Ella became a Polifer she,

28:34.310 --> 28:36.810
she suffered a terrible
tumble down a cliff.

28:38.670 --> 28:40.570
We did everything we
could to fix her.

28:47.382 --> 28:48.932
- That's not possible out here.

28:50.060 --> 28:51.420
I did what I could.

28:53.997 --> 28:56.160
- Ivan is a very good doctor.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.900
He has healing hands.

29:01.210 --> 29:03.060
- I just wish I could
have done more.

29:07.450 --> 29:09.930
Go on, eat up, that's good meat.

29:39.470 --> 29:42.540
Caitlin, give me
all your eights.

29:43.710 --> 29:44.710
- Go fish.

29:53.469 --> 29:54.469
- No!

29:56.875 --> 29:58.042
Okay, alright.

30:00.810 --> 30:01.810
Let me see, now.

30:03.740 --> 30:06.640
Ella, give me all your kings.

30:34.050 --> 30:35.480
- It was, indeed.

30:41.100 --> 30:45.450
- I gotta tell you, what
you have going on up here,

30:47.240 --> 30:49.390
it's not at all what
somebody might expect.

30:51.460 --> 30:53.259
- My great great grand
daddy moved across

30:53.260 --> 30:56.730
the country at a time of
great political turmoil.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.740
Things were changing
in the republic.

31:01.800 --> 31:04.629
People with different
views, like himself,

31:04.630 --> 31:06.180
just were not accepted.

31:08.760 --> 31:11.599
- So he came up here
to build a utopia.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.470
- That's right, and
it wasn't easy.

31:16.310 --> 31:20.239
He'd settle somewhere, other
people would find him

31:20.240 --> 31:23.180
and curse him and
he'd have to move on.

31:25.600 --> 31:29.989
Even now, here in this place,
we are in constant danger

31:29.990 --> 31:33.900
of being found and forced
to move back into society.

31:35.370 --> 31:37.420
- The world has changed
a lot since then.

31:39.403 --> 31:43.859
It might not be such a bad
idea to have some contact.

31:43.860 --> 31:47.040
- Well, I doubt it's changed
as much as you might think.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.290
Like I said, we do get
people through here.

31:52.490 --> 31:54.940
They all paint pretty much
the same damn picture.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.610
Intrusive government,
biased people.

32:05.230 --> 32:07.640
- What are your ways
that we wouldn't accept?

32:09.347 --> 32:14.347
I mean, you all seem
like normal people.

32:16.440 --> 32:21.440
I mean, you might need some
time to adjust, but...

32:23.600 --> 32:26.777
- Tell you what, how
about you and me

32:26.778 --> 32:28.378
doing a little hunting
tomorrow morning?

32:28.402 --> 32:31.572
Maybe it'd give you a
taste of our life.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.389
- Okay, sure.

32:35.390 --> 32:36.223
- Good.

32:36.223 --> 32:37.223
- Sounds like fun.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.216
Should I bring my wife?

32:41.595 --> 32:43.026
- Men only.

32:55.914 --> 32:57.234
- I can't wait
three to four days

32:57.258 --> 33:00.599
for the car to be fixed,
if he can even fix it.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.497
I say we take our packs and
we head towards the road.

33:03.498 --> 33:05.998
- I was supposed to go
hunting with Ivan tomorrow.

33:09.560 --> 33:10.560
- Sort of.

33:11.530 --> 33:14.639
He's weird, but
some of the things

33:14.640 --> 33:16.250
he says kind of make sense.

33:18.430 --> 33:22.310
This place has a cozy,
homely feel to it.

33:23.720 --> 33:27.669
- Okay, um, killing animals with

33:27.670 --> 33:29.870
creepy mountain guy
not such a good idea.

33:33.010 --> 33:35.730
- Think of it like an
extraordinary adventure.

33:36.660 --> 33:39.769
If we traveled anywhere
else in the world

33:39.770 --> 33:43.140
we'd be coming into a
new culture, new place.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.500
You always say it's
about the journey.

33:48.630 --> 33:49.630
This is our journey.

33:51.570 --> 33:54.280
- Okay, fine, one day.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.040
But we leave Monday
morning bright and early

33:57.064 --> 33:59.114
and we go try and
find reception, okay?

33:59.115 --> 34:00.115
- Okay.

34:09.909 --> 34:12.089
You come from a large family?

34:12.090 --> 34:14.739
No, no I'm an only child.

34:14.739 --> 34:16.610
I was adopted when I was three.

34:17.850 --> 34:19.339
Adopted?

34:19.340 --> 34:22.810
Yeah, my birth parents
abandoned me.

34:24.420 --> 34:25.879
They took me in.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.418
I see.

34:27.420 --> 34:28.510
I know about that.

34:29.620 --> 34:30.829
Seen it happen here.

34:30.830 --> 34:32.009
Oh, yeah?

34:32.010 --> 34:34.540
- Oh yeah, we take
family very seriously.

34:35.630 --> 34:37.489
It is the only thing
we have up here.

34:41.469 --> 34:43.889
Did your adoptive
parents treat you good?

34:43.889 --> 34:47.458
- Of course, they tried to
give me everything life has.

34:47.458 --> 34:50.190
There are just some things
you just can't give.

34:54.310 --> 34:55.980
- No, not really, no.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.859
They just weren't
prepared to handle

34:59.860 --> 35:01.899
the things I had to deal with.

35:01.900 --> 35:02.890
No way they could be.

35:02.891 --> 35:04.927
- Yeah, no one ever is.

35:13.960 --> 35:16.010
- Oh, it's nothing you
gotta worry about.

35:18.719 --> 35:21.470
Probably just a, a
badger or something.

35:26.929 --> 35:27.929
- Okay.

35:36.910 --> 35:39.810
- Kendra, why don't you come
on over here and help me out?

35:40.900 --> 35:43.229
- Yeah, not that
much of a gardener.

35:43.230 --> 35:45.110
- Oh, there's nothing to it.

35:47.870 --> 35:50.460
- Well, every plant I've
ever touched has died.

35:52.970 --> 35:56.210
- Everything dies,
that's part of life.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.040
- There are some
other things we do.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.270
Mostly this, though.

36:08.140 --> 36:10.510
- I think I'd go nuts
without having a computer.

36:17.060 --> 36:19.329
Access to the internet,
unlimited sources

36:19.330 --> 36:22.129
of information at
your fingertips.

36:22.130 --> 36:24.830
Technology has given us
everything we could ever need.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.369
- We live just fine without it.

36:29.370 --> 36:33.090
- Yeah, well that's great,
but I couldn't do it.

36:45.329 --> 36:46.689
- That should be
enough for today.

36:46.690 --> 36:48.839
Caitlin, bring those
vegetables on over

36:48.840 --> 36:50.820
and we're gonna get
headed back home.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.210
Help me up, honey.

36:55.050 --> 36:56.050
Of course.

37:06.160 --> 37:08.630
- Well, yes.

37:10.550 --> 37:14.110
I love my wife, I
love my parents.

37:15.030 --> 37:18.379
My job is bleh, but what
can you do about that?

37:18.380 --> 37:19.380
Yeah.

37:25.390 --> 37:28.140
- Every aspect of my
life fills me with joy.

37:29.360 --> 37:32.980
Each morning is filled with
wondrous possibilities.

37:34.010 --> 37:37.300
In the evening, I have dinner
with my lovely family.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.040
- I've never heard
someone so upbeat.

37:43.038 --> 37:45.529
- You walk a mile
in my shoes, son,

37:45.530 --> 37:47.290
you might be that happy, too.

37:48.668 --> 37:49.668
Oh, oh, oh.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.529
Look there, see?

37:53.530 --> 37:55.189
A rabbit.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.619
- Yeah, yeah.

37:56.620 --> 37:57.620
- Yeah.

37:58.740 --> 37:59.840
I want you to kill it.

38:01.310 --> 38:03.606
- Oh, I don't know how
to shoot this thing.

38:03.607 --> 38:05.169
- No, just line the
rabbit up with

38:05.170 --> 38:07.259
the end of the barrel
and right here.

38:07.260 --> 38:08.441
You got him.

38:08.442 --> 38:09.525
Go on, go on.

38:13.730 --> 38:14.730
Line him up.

38:15.396 --> 38:16.396
- Yeah, that's it.

38:17.960 --> 38:18.960
Line him up.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.590
Little lower, breathe easy.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.150
Don't think about anything else.

38:25.990 --> 38:26.990
Just the kill.

38:34.630 --> 38:36.350
- You mentioned you
had other children.

38:37.810 --> 38:39.300
- Yes.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.810
- Most of them died.

38:49.950 --> 38:52.209
The forest can be unforgiving.

38:52.210 --> 38:54.800
Oh, I'm so sorry.

38:57.530 --> 38:58.530
- No.

39:00.230 --> 39:02.209
Lance and I are gonna
try next year.

39:02.210 --> 39:04.460
Once I get to where I
need to be at the firm.

39:06.770 --> 39:07.770
My job.

39:12.570 --> 39:13.570
- Definitely.

39:17.659 --> 39:19.483
- I'm a lawyer.

39:19.484 --> 39:21.029
- That pays a lot.

39:21.030 --> 39:22.030
- Yeah.

39:24.150 --> 39:25.669
How do you know that?

39:25.670 --> 39:29.909
- Oh, we had this
couple early this year.

39:29.910 --> 39:31.999
Fella was a lawyer,
like you say,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.780
couldn't stop talking
about his job.

39:36.870 --> 39:39.849
- Yeah, that's right,
that's what I heard.

39:39.850 --> 39:42.469
- Kids, they pick
up on one thing

39:42.470 --> 39:45.480
from the outside world
and they go runnin' off.

39:47.860 --> 39:49.850
But not Caitlin.

39:50.750 --> 39:52.400
You're staying
here, right honey?

39:58.964 --> 40:00.459
- Kendra.

40:00.460 --> 40:01.460
- Lance.

40:02.967 --> 40:03.967
Oh, my God!

40:03.967 --> 40:04.967
What happened?

40:06.670 --> 40:07.969
Who did this to you?

40:07.970 --> 40:09.169
Was it Ivan?

40:09.170 --> 40:11.258
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

40:12.805 --> 40:13.805
What the hell?

40:13.805 --> 40:14.805
- It's not my blood.

40:15.870 --> 40:17.039
We were skinning the rabbits

40:17.040 --> 40:19.852
and the damn thing
squirted all over me.

40:19.853 --> 40:21.449
You're such an asshole!

40:21.450 --> 40:24.209
Come on, Ivan thought
it would be funny, too.

40:24.210 --> 40:26.399
- Oh, I'm sure he did.

40:26.400 --> 40:29.349
- I'm sorry, it was a joke.

40:29.350 --> 40:32.209
- Well, screw you with
your mountain man jokes!

40:32.210 --> 40:35.177
- Come on, I was
just playing, relax.

40:35.178 --> 40:36.290
Relax.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.470
Have some fun on your time off.

40:42.860 --> 40:43.860
I love you.

40:45.060 --> 40:46.060
Relax.

40:50.488 --> 40:51.849
- Oh!

40:51.850 --> 40:52.850
- Relax.

40:53.523 --> 40:54.523
- Oh, you're stupid.

41:10.864 --> 41:13.044
Oh, yeah.

41:19.040 --> 41:20.055
Oh.

41:20.056 --> 41:21.056
- Get up.

41:22.265 --> 41:24.499
Oh, yeah.

41:31.968 --> 41:33.318
- We gotta get out of here.

41:37.780 --> 41:40.350
- That freak Vlad was just
jerking off over there.

41:45.130 --> 41:46.130
Are you sure?

41:47.618 --> 41:48.785
- I'm leaving.

41:56.070 --> 41:57.230
- Some trip.

42:20.378 --> 42:21.378
- Fuck!

42:21.379 --> 42:23.429
See, this is what I
was talking about!

42:23.430 --> 42:24.778
Hillbillies stole
my fucking gun!

42:26.444 --> 42:27.549
- Yeah!

42:27.550 --> 42:30.119
- I'm sure they put
it in a safe place.

42:30.120 --> 42:32.249
You don't want Caitlin
hurting herself with it

42:32.250 --> 42:36.049
knowing there's no
hospital close by, right?

42:36.050 --> 42:38.039
- They stole my gun.

42:38.040 --> 42:39.820
- I don't understand
you sometimes.

42:41.090 --> 42:43.589
Why can't you just be
trusting for once?

42:43.590 --> 42:46.109
- I'm sorry, you want me
to yell at you all night?

42:46.110 --> 42:47.210
- They're good people.

42:48.350 --> 42:50.669
They don't have the social
graces that we're used to,

42:50.670 --> 42:55.179
but that's no reason to be so
offensive every fucking time!

42:55.180 --> 42:58.709
- So, my husband is trusting
some redneck over his own wife?

42:58.710 --> 43:00.459
I'm serious!

43:00.460 --> 43:03.149
- You know, you have
no idea what it's like

43:03.150 --> 43:05.139
to be in a real situation
because you've

43:05.140 --> 43:06.380
never been in a real situation.

43:06.381 --> 43:07.661
Well, let me tell you something,

43:07.685 --> 43:09.049
this is a real situation!

43:09.050 --> 43:10.759
- That's your go-to.

43:10.760 --> 43:13.209
You had a tough life,
so I know nothing.

43:13.210 --> 43:14.899
- Yeah, it's true.

43:14.900 --> 43:16.540
- No, it's not!

43:20.600 --> 43:21.600
- Holy shit.

43:24.560 --> 43:25.620
Are you hurt?

43:38.280 --> 43:40.380
Alright motherfucker,
you wanna go?

43:43.910 --> 43:45.009
- Babe.

43:47.210 --> 43:49.380
- You were right about
that real situation.

44:15.200 --> 44:16.950
Come on back to the house.

44:21.330 --> 44:22.580
Who are all those people?

44:26.010 --> 44:29.330
- You shouldn't wander
into the woods at night.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.340
Tell me what's going
on right now.

45:36.250 --> 45:38.150
You're not looking
very hard, are you?

45:41.000 --> 45:43.250
I'm sorry, I know it's
not your fault, but...

45:44.311 --> 45:45.509
I just wanna get out of here.

45:45.510 --> 45:46.410
So do I.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.339
He knew we wanted to leave.

45:48.340 --> 45:50.090
What do you want from me?

45:51.030 --> 45:53.019
Maybe he had other
things to take care of.

45:53.020 --> 45:55.199
- He lives in the
middle of the forest.

45:55.200 --> 45:56.530
His other things can wait!

45:57.660 --> 45:59.209
Okay, no more bullshit.

45:59.210 --> 46:00.730
Where exactly did Ivan go?

46:02.148 --> 46:03.409
- I don't know.

46:03.410 --> 46:05.019
It's not my place to ask.

46:05.020 --> 46:08.869
- Jesus Christ, it's like talking
to a wall with you people!

46:08.870 --> 46:11.219
Okay, let me put this simply.

46:11.220 --> 46:13.659
Who are the people
in the forest?

46:13.660 --> 46:15.930
- Oh, we don't talk about them.

46:18.190 --> 46:19.190
- Yes.

46:20.920 --> 46:23.910
- If you wanted to leave
this house, could you?

46:25.410 --> 46:27.849
- This is my home, I
wouldn't ever leave.

46:27.850 --> 46:29.459
- That's not the
question I asked.

46:29.460 --> 46:30.460
Could you?

46:36.710 --> 46:39.169
I don't know what that means.

46:39.170 --> 46:40.003
- Give it a rest.

46:40.004 --> 46:41.039
Come outside with me.

46:41.040 --> 46:43.239
- I'll give it a rest, when
I'm back on the highway.

46:43.240 --> 46:44.220
- Come, please, please.

46:44.220 --> 46:45.053
What?

46:45.053 --> 46:45.886
Please, please.

46:45.886 --> 46:46.886
What's wrong with you?

47:01.890 --> 47:03.730
- It's not safe for you here.

47:04.630 --> 47:05.630
What's going on?

47:06.520 --> 47:07.889
- You have to see what they are.

47:07.890 --> 47:09.440
Then you'll understand.

47:10.920 --> 47:12.600
They have caves.

47:14.310 --> 47:16.029
- Follow the river upstream.

47:16.030 --> 47:18.280
At the big log you'll
see it off to the side.

47:24.591 --> 47:25.891
Don't touch me!

47:34.690 --> 47:36.473
- Keep her busy.

47:40.180 --> 47:42.500
- I'm tired of you always
telling me what to do!

47:43.917 --> 47:45.617
You don't know
everything, Kendra!

47:46.630 --> 47:47.989
- If you weren't being an idiot,

47:47.990 --> 47:50.979
I wouldn't have to tell you
what to do all the time!

47:50.980 --> 47:53.490
- I'm so fucking tired of you!

47:55.922 --> 47:57.191
- Bitch!

49:20.290 --> 49:21.390
Thank you, Boy Scouts.

50:00.660 --> 50:01.660
Shit!

50:19.606 --> 50:22.939
Get the hell out of
here with this shit.

50:35.157 --> 50:36.157
Look at this.

50:40.420 --> 50:41.539
- Gold teeth.

50:41.540 --> 50:43.149
- From the cave.

50:43.150 --> 50:45.449
There's a ton of stuff like that

50:45.450 --> 50:47.529
and the caves are huge.

50:47.530 --> 50:48.980
Who knows what else is there?

50:52.009 --> 50:53.259
- They're killing people.

50:54.888 --> 50:56.440
We need to get out of here now.

50:58.120 --> 51:00.385
- I told her to hide on the
other side of the hills.

51:00.386 --> 51:02.047
- Let's go.

51:12.030 --> 51:14.019
- Ivan should be back soon.

51:14.020 --> 51:15.400
- We're not waiting for Ivan.

51:16.280 --> 51:18.249
- It's dangerous...

51:18.250 --> 51:19.650
- Get the fuck away from me!

51:20.970 --> 51:23.500
- That's uncalled for.

51:24.920 --> 51:26.948
- You walk right out
the door there!

51:26.949 --> 51:27.850
- You crazy bitch!

51:27.851 --> 51:30.440
You tell me how we get out
of this fucking forest!

51:31.420 --> 51:32.550
- You can't.

51:34.480 --> 51:35.480
- You watch me.

51:37.820 --> 51:39.799
- Such a nice girl.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.949
You got a bit of a mouth on ya,

51:41.950 --> 51:43.699
but you're pretty.

51:43.700 --> 51:46.330
We could have made you
happy here with us.

51:47.163 --> 51:48.563
Happy to cut off
your fucking head!

51:50.442 --> 51:51.930
- Come on, let's go!

51:55.029 --> 51:56.951
Such a shame!

51:56.952 --> 52:00.216
It would have been nice having
another woman in the house.

52:22.174 --> 52:23.174
- Lance!

52:26.684 --> 52:27.684
Lance!

52:36.184 --> 52:37.684
Caitlin?

52:49.080 --> 52:52.390
- So you'd get scared
and wanna escape.

52:52.391 --> 52:54.319
Escape?

52:54.320 --> 52:56.610
- Yeah, you're all
tough or whatever.

52:57.820 --> 52:58.820
Especially you.

53:00.186 --> 53:02.620
I think you might actually
make it out of here.

53:05.965 --> 53:06.965
- A few times.

53:10.490 --> 53:11.490
- Two years.

53:12.970 --> 53:14.350
I had a real mom and dad.

53:15.700 --> 53:18.215
Then they killed them
and brought me here.

53:22.470 --> 53:25.940
And all this time, you've
never been able to escape?

53:28.570 --> 53:29.570
- No.

53:32.163 --> 53:33.770
- Because of the
people in the woods.

53:34.970 --> 53:36.270
They always bring me back.

53:37.390 --> 53:40.550
I tried going in a bunch of
different directions but...

53:44.430 --> 53:47.109
Is Ella being held
against her will?

53:47.110 --> 53:48.319
- I don't know.

53:48.320 --> 53:50.870
I've never actually seen
her or Ramon kill anybody.

54:00.200 --> 54:01.200
- A couple like you.

54:03.140 --> 54:04.140
A family.

54:04.850 --> 54:05.890
- Jesus Christ.

54:06.920 --> 54:09.079
How many of these wood people
do you think are there?

54:09.080 --> 54:11.190
- I don't know, a
hundred, a thousand.

54:12.453 --> 54:14.628
- Do you know why they
keep bringing you back?

54:14.629 --> 54:16.839
- I don't know, I just,
I just wanna go home!

54:16.840 --> 54:20.950
- Caitlin, we'll take you home.

54:24.938 --> 54:25.938
- Promise.

55:42.340 --> 55:44.829
Jesus Christ, we're screwed.

55:44.830 --> 55:46.430
Shut up.

55:46.431 --> 55:48.031
- Look at them.

55:48.032 --> 55:49.115
- I see them.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
We need to find the gun.

56:01.001 --> 56:02.850
It's somewhere in the house.

56:04.360 --> 56:06.802
- First we gotta figure
out how many there are.

56:06.803 --> 56:08.319
I'm telling you,
they're everywhere.

56:08.320 --> 56:10.720
- We need to know exactly
what we're dealing with.

56:49.405 --> 56:50.405
Oh, shit!

56:51.670 --> 56:52.670
- Told ya.

56:53.350 --> 56:54.350
Everywhere.

56:55.490 --> 56:56.740
- Now, we get the gun.

57:02.840 --> 57:04.579
The more I see these fuckers,

57:04.580 --> 57:05.980
the more I think
it was one of them

57:06.004 --> 57:07.439
that jumped in front
of our truck.

57:07.440 --> 57:09.019
Really, ya think?

57:09.020 --> 57:11.670
They sprung the trap,
delivered us to Ivan.

57:13.560 --> 57:16.029
Caitlin, when you got captured,

57:16.030 --> 57:17.030
how did they do it?

57:18.230 --> 57:19.449
- We were camping.

57:19.450 --> 57:21.329
They attacked us in the night.

57:21.330 --> 57:22.839
- Opportunists.

57:22.840 --> 57:25.069
- You said you would
take me home.

57:25.070 --> 57:26.429
- We will.

57:26.430 --> 57:29.130
- Do you know where
they might keep my gun?

57:32.420 --> 57:33.420
- I don't know.

57:33.421 --> 57:35.449
- What the hell you been
doing the past two years?

57:35.450 --> 57:37.240
Walking around with your
fucking eyes closed?

57:38.440 --> 57:39.440
She's just a little girl.

57:39.441 --> 57:40.829
- What, I don't give a shit.

57:40.830 --> 57:42.350
You don't seem to get
what's going on.

57:42.374 --> 57:43.349
- I get it!

57:43.350 --> 57:44.659
I get it big time.

57:44.660 --> 57:46.059
- No, these fucking
people are gonna kill us

57:46.060 --> 57:47.759
and that's the best
case scenario!

57:47.760 --> 57:50.560
- Well yelling at her isn't
going to do anyone any good.

57:51.709 --> 57:52.829
- Let's just go get the gun.

57:52.830 --> 57:53.780
- From the cave.

57:53.780 --> 57:54.780
- From the house.

57:56.270 --> 57:57.919
- They keep their
loot in the caves.

57:57.920 --> 58:00.289
- If I stole a gun, I would
keep it in the house.

58:00.290 --> 58:02.009
I'd keep it close,
we go to the house.

58:02.010 --> 58:04.019
- Mary and Vlad were at
the house before we left.

58:04.020 --> 58:05.579
They're probably still there.

58:05.580 --> 58:06.940
- I know I should
have killed that

58:06.964 --> 58:08.794
fucking bitch when
I had the chance!

58:12.120 --> 58:14.530
Fine, we go to the stupid caves.

58:18.090 --> 58:19.090
Fuck!

59:08.170 --> 59:10.529
- Radiator's busted,
it's gonna overheat.

59:10.530 --> 59:11.530
- Not immediately.

59:12.890 --> 59:14.140
- We don't have any keys.

59:15.280 --> 59:17.080
- Well, you're
street, hotwire it.

01:00:20.372 --> 01:00:21.372
- Not very.

01:00:24.012 --> 01:00:25.012
This way.

01:00:39.367 --> 01:00:41.559
Anything?

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.810
Nope.

01:00:55.146 --> 01:00:57.639
What the hell was that?

01:02:19.975 --> 01:02:24.797
- There's something familiar
about all this to me.

01:02:24.798 --> 01:02:27.030
I have to figure out why.

01:02:27.031 --> 01:02:30.621
- Oh no, we need to
get out of here.

01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:34.498
- We need the gun in
order to do that.

01:02:34.499 --> 01:02:35.940
Let's sneak around.

01:02:35.941 --> 01:02:38.739
- No, let's go check
out the house now.

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:40.030
I have an idea.

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:47.730
It's me.

01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:58.446
- Oh, it's you, Caitlin.

01:02:58.447 --> 01:02:59.697
Hi.

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:02.950
Is it time for supper?

01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:05.679
- No, not that time yet.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.190
Just bored.

01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:12.630
Maybe I could braid your hair?

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.810
- Oh, that'd be nice.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.780
- Here, just relax.

01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:33.080
- That feels so nice.

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:10.320
- You're brave,
well that's good.

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:13.620
You know who this is?

01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:15.870
This was one of my children.

01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.820
- All this talk about
family and security

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.400
and this is what you do?

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.540
- I feed them, I clothe
them, I train 'em.

01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:31.269
But inevitably some
of them will begin

01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:33.549
to think for
themselves and since

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:37.069
we can abide no insubordination,

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:38.359
that is when it is time for them

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.590
to be recycled back
into the family.

01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:45.019
- Oh, indeed.

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.320
It's very tasty, you had
some the other night.

01:04:49.174 --> 01:04:50.174
You seemed to enjoy it.

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:57.484
Of course, I do save some of
the best parts for myself.

01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:07.159
Our home has been here
since long before

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.109
I was born and it
will be here long

01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:12.689
after I, too, have
been consumed.

01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:16.439
It is a part of the
cycle of our family.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.120
A cycle that you
are now a part of.

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.750
- It was no accident us
ending up here, was it?

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:29.389
- We were hoping we
could convince you

01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:30.629
to stay of your own free will,

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:32.850
but since that is now
no longer possible,

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.610
we just mandate that you stay.

01:05:40.808 --> 01:05:42.108
- You can't shoot us both.

01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:45.010
- Just you.

01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:46.632
- The fuck you will.

01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:48.950
- Lance!

01:05:59.601 --> 01:06:01.969
- A shame to have to eat you,

01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:04.560
but insubordination can
never be tolerated.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:18.800
- Eat!

01:06:22.971 --> 01:06:23.971
More!

01:06:34.394 --> 01:06:35.394
More!

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.250
- You're wasting your energy.

01:07:00.339 --> 01:07:02.589
It's good for you.

01:07:15.112 --> 01:07:16.112
- Let me go.

01:07:17.596 --> 01:07:18.679
- Afraid not.

01:07:55.781 --> 01:07:57.181
- Did you know that
in order to get

01:07:57.205 --> 01:08:00.569
that wonderful
marbling in steak,

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:02.039
they force feed the animal for

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.489
two weeks before the slaughter?

01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:06.649
And during that time
they they gotta

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:08.960
make sure the animal
barely moves at all.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:14.569
See this forces the fat to
form at an accelerated rate.

01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:16.698
So, what would
ordinarily be dry,

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:20.609
tough beef becomes
rich, tender meat.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.019
- You should be grateful.

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:27.969
No more waiting to start

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:30.910
the wonderful journey
of motherhood.

01:08:34.612 --> 01:08:36.309
- Of course, farmers
do have an advantage.

01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:39.100
They know what their
animals have been eating.

01:08:41.109 --> 01:08:42.810
We don't have that advantage.

01:08:52.285 --> 01:08:54.024
Fuck!

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.170
- I forgot how good
dark skin tastes.

01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:16.430
- Ivan is the father to all.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:20.469
All the Polifers in the forest.

01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:23.010
All the children in the caves.

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:25.790
- Inbred fucks!

01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:30.499
- Well, they were for a
time, but Ivan's father

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.669
realized that he had
breed with other women.

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:37.640
Otherwise, the children
suffered defects.

01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:44.290
- No.

01:09:46.173 --> 01:09:47.519
- Let me out.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.120
We can get out of here together.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.609
- I've been a Polifer
for 40 years.

01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:55.969
I don't much wanna leave.

01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:58.980
- He stole you away
from your family.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.630
- He showed me the light.

01:10:12.570 --> 01:10:13.660
- She's ready.

01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:18.810
- You will be a welcomed
addition to our family.

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:21.060
Mary.

01:10:22.328 --> 01:10:25.099
- Let me go, you sick fuck!

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.100
- Head home.

01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:37.910
Kendra I am very
excited for this.

01:10:39.415 --> 01:10:41.115
See, you will
probably be my last.

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:44.749
Two years Caitlin will
reach the age of ascension

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:48.120
and Vlad will take her
as his first wife,

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:50.990
become leader of the Polifers.

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:56.260
Then I will be obsolete and
no longer allowed to mate.

01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.263
But, until then...

01:10:59.264 --> 01:11:00.552
- Don't touch me.

01:11:00.553 --> 01:11:02.339
- Oh Kendra, Kendra.

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:05.339
I have built a society
of inclusion.

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:08.319
We're all treated as equals.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.469
Simple rules, simple
consequences.

01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:13.560
A life free from
worry and doubt.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.134
- It's all lies.

01:11:16.135 --> 01:11:17.349
You manipulate all of them!

01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:19.449
- Soon you will see.

01:11:19.450 --> 01:11:22.350
Soon, you will love me.

01:11:23.364 --> 01:11:24.869
- Never!

01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:25.870
- Kendra.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.759
If you become
properly assimilated

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.059
and accept the Polifer
ways, then eventually you,

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:35.839
too, will be in the
house like Mary.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.100
Huh?

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:44.670
- Well then you will be
assimilated, piece by piece.

01:11:49.674 --> 01:11:51.030
Oh, don't do that, no.

01:11:51.031 --> 01:11:52.031
- Don't no, please stop!

01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:54.279
- No more waiting.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.100
Time to receive your seed.

01:11:57.919 --> 01:12:00.474
- No, get away from me!

01:12:00.475 --> 01:12:01.475
No, please!

01:12:02.465 --> 01:12:06.298
Please, stop, no!

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.630
- Stay away from her, you fucks!

01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:27.410
Shit!

01:12:30.955 --> 01:12:32.372
Wait!

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:35.860
- Get this off me.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.119
Where's Kendra?

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.220
Follow me.

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:07.010
- I'll be back tomorrow.

01:13:08.118 --> 01:13:09.118
- Fuck you.

01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:19.640
- No, she's not for you.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.080
Not yet.

01:14:18.889 --> 01:14:19.889
- Help me.

01:14:20.592 --> 01:14:21.925
Help me, please.

01:14:31.222 --> 01:14:32.765
Help me, please.

01:14:36.368 --> 01:14:37.902
Oh, you stupid piece of shit.

01:14:37.903 --> 01:14:40.638
Here, here.

01:14:54.475 --> 01:14:56.265
Get me out of here.

01:14:56.266 --> 01:14:57.266
Get me out.

01:14:58.743 --> 01:15:00.326
Get me out of here.

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:13.410
- Let's go get the
gun from the house.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.670
- If it's even there.

01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:18.830
- It'll be there.

01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:23.680
I'm sorry, I should
have listened to you.

01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:40.029
Which way?

01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:41.030
- This way.

01:15:44.214 --> 01:15:45.214
- Run, run, run!

01:15:50.439 --> 01:15:52.356
Get back here!

01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:55.720
Hurry!

01:15:59.421 --> 01:16:02.169
Faster, go, go, go, go, go!

01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:03.320
I'll kill you!

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.950
- Hurry up, go, go, go!

01:16:18.959 --> 01:16:20.324
Watch out.

01:16:27.603 --> 01:16:28.603
- Come on!

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:03.349
- You and Caitlin
check the kitchen.

01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:04.400
I'll check over here.

01:17:45.648 --> 01:17:46.870
- Shh.

01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:48.359
No.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.360
That way.

01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:06.780
- Hi there.

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.080
It's gonna be okay.

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:16.460
Stay quiet.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.350
She's coming with us.

01:18:44.914 --> 01:18:47.039
- No, we gotta get out of here.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.979
We can't worry about
somebody else.

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:50.190
- She's a prisoner.

01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:54.930
Do you want to come with us?

01:18:56.734 --> 01:18:57.734
- I go you.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:09.994
Here.

01:19:11.745 --> 01:19:13.662
Come with me.

01:19:44.578 --> 01:19:46.411
Where are the bullets?

01:20:12.214 --> 01:20:13.214
- Go!

01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:27.180
- Oh, we're so screwed!

01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:32.819
- Cut it out!

01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:33.820
Stop it!

01:20:35.328 --> 01:20:37.090
- I can't do it anymore.

01:20:37.091 --> 01:20:38.174
- I need you.

01:20:39.947 --> 01:20:41.260
I need my Kendra back.

01:20:42.527 --> 01:20:43.527
- I can't.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.240
- We're gonna drive out of here.

01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:53.785
We're gonna make it.

01:20:53.786 --> 01:20:54.786
Okay?

01:20:56.176 --> 01:20:57.176
- Okay.

01:20:57.855 --> 01:20:59.279
- Yes, okay.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.280
- Together.

01:21:03.312 --> 01:21:04.312
- Okay.

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.756
- Give me the hatchet.

01:21:29.639 --> 01:21:30.889
- I don't know.

01:21:46.230 --> 01:21:47.230
Stay back!

01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:48.063
Let her go!

01:21:48.064 --> 01:21:49.409
- Stay back!

01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:52.806
I swear, I thought you'd show
more respect for your family.

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:55.850
- I can't believe
you don't remember.

01:21:57.810 --> 01:21:59.160
You were born here!

01:22:00.114 --> 01:22:01.114
- You're lying.

01:22:01.115 --> 01:22:02.293
- It's true.

01:22:02.294 --> 01:22:04.191
When you were about
three your mother

01:22:04.192 --> 01:22:05.976
took you and ran into the woods.

01:22:05.977 --> 01:22:08.377
When we caught up to her
she paid for her crime.

01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:10.820
But you were gone.

01:22:12.050 --> 01:22:14.159
- He's fucking with your head!

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.160
Caitlin no, wait!

01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:19.739
- You're just saying
this to get me to stop.

01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:21.719
- I knew it the
second I saw you.

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.080
That scar on your arm.

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.070
I gave it to you.

01:22:26.815 --> 01:22:27.815
Look!

01:22:27.816 --> 01:22:29.561
- Don't listen to him, don't!

01:22:29.562 --> 01:22:30.562
- Look!

01:22:31.556 --> 01:22:34.337
Every Polifer son gets one.

01:22:34.338 --> 01:22:38.255
- We gotta get out of
here just, just kill him!

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:45.300
- This whole place it felt like,

01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:48.170
home.

01:22:54.441 --> 01:22:56.925
- You're the family I've been
looking for my whole life.

01:22:56.926 --> 01:22:58.093
- No baby, no!

01:23:02.615 --> 01:23:04.305
No baby, no.

01:23:04.306 --> 01:23:05.306
No baby, no.

01:23:07.124 --> 01:23:08.324
No!

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.950
- You are so stupid!

01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:16.580
How can you not see the
greatness of our family?

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.440
Huh?

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.281
- You've taken
everything from me!

01:23:25.904 --> 01:23:27.580
- I've given you life!

01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:32.263
The life you clearly
don't deserve.

01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:40.170
- You need to die, fuck!

01:23:52.063 --> 01:23:53.063
- Kendra!

01:23:56.275 --> 01:23:58.192
Baby, baby, okay, okay.

01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:07.910
Come on, come on, come on.

01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:16.820
- Okay.

01:24:18.212 --> 01:24:19.212
Okay.

01:24:26.614 --> 01:24:30.710
- Son I am, truly sorry
it had to end like this.

01:24:32.292 --> 01:24:35.069
Everything could have
been so different.

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:37.640
If you had only
accepted who you are.

01:24:48.992 --> 01:24:50.196
- Ivan!

01:25:13.079 --> 01:25:14.619
- Fuck you!

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:15.690
Fuck you!

01:25:22.103 --> 01:25:23.450
Lance, we gotta go now!

01:25:26.850 --> 01:25:27.850
- Shit!

01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:29.720
Get Ella to the car.

01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:32.046
I'll grab Kendra.

01:25:54.024 --> 01:25:55.024
Chill, car.

01:26:11.256 --> 01:26:13.173
I am gonna fuck him up.

01:26:14.032 --> 01:26:15.151
Hang on.

01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:21.950
Shit!
