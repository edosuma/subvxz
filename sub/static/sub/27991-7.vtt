WEBVTT

00:01.880 --> 00:03.150
All we have to do
to save the world

00:03.150 --> 00:04.550
is get these two to kiss.

00:04.550 --> 00:06.150
Have you guys ever thought
about a Kiss Cam?

00:06.150 --> 00:07.620
Let's make it happen.

00:07.620 --> 00:09.280
Ooh, there's
a cozy-looking couple.

00:09.290 --> 00:11.420
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

00:11.420 --> 00:12.420
Kiss! Kiss!
They're choking.

00:12.420 --> 00:13.490
I'm going home.

00:13.490 --> 00:14.620
Okay, fine. Go home.

00:14.630 --> 00:16.360
How are we gonna fix this?

00:16.360 --> 00:19.630
Did someone order a miracle?

00:19.630 --> 00:22.630
The bet's off.
I'm here to save the world.

00:23.970 --> 00:25.030
O-Okay.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.900
Shit.

00:26.900 --> 00:29.100
Oh, how's this thing going?

00:32.780 --> 00:33.910
My name is Raymond.

00:33.910 --> 00:35.240
I work
in the Department of Clouds.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.780
We have no leadership.
No direction.

00:38.780 --> 00:40.250
Every day, you just come in

00:40.250 --> 00:41.980
and make any kind
of cloud you want.

00:41.990 --> 00:44.720
Big puffy cloud,
little dotty cloud,

00:44.720 --> 00:46.450
long, streaky cloud...

00:46.460 --> 00:47.720
fine, go for it.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.860
No one cares.

00:48.860 --> 00:50.790
Sometimes, I get so bored,

00:50.800 --> 00:53.730
I like to make my cloud
look like things.

00:53.730 --> 00:57.330
Like a turtle
or a car or something.

00:57.330 --> 00:59.870
Occasionally,
some kid will notice.

00:59.870 --> 01:03.070
But, mostly, nobody looks up.

01:03.070 --> 01:05.810
Nadia.
Department of Male Nipples.

01:05.810 --> 01:08.080
They were supposed
to squirt orange juice.

01:08.080 --> 01:11.350
The male nipple doesn't work,
and it never will.

01:11.350 --> 01:13.820
But we still gotta
clock in every morning

01:13.820 --> 01:15.750
and pretend that today's the day

01:15.750 --> 01:17.820
that we're gonna crack
that nipple.

01:17.820 --> 01:19.420
I'll be honest:

01:19.420 --> 01:22.020
I'm always high, you know?

01:22.890 --> 01:25.430
My name's Carla.
I work in Bug Control.

01:25.430 --> 01:28.160
Or should I say Bug "Control"?

01:28.160 --> 01:30.170
We can't control them.

01:30.170 --> 01:31.500
They do whatever they want.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.640
They run all over the place,
fly around in crazy circles.

01:34.640 --> 01:35.770
They're nuts.

01:35.770 --> 01:36.970
My name's Frank.

01:36.970 --> 01:39.040
I make the Northern Lights.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.180
Why are there no Eastern Lights?

01:41.180 --> 01:43.650
Why can't I try
some Western Lights?

01:43.650 --> 01:45.380
I'll tell ya why.

01:45.380 --> 01:47.450
The [bleep] union.

01:47.450 --> 01:48.780
We spent a thousand years

01:48.790 --> 01:50.790
trying to make
a "bug-controlling helmet."

01:50.790 --> 01:55.390
You put it on, you're supposed
to be able to steer a bug.

01:55.390 --> 01:57.790
So stupid.

01:57.790 --> 01:59.060
So stupid.

01:59.060 --> 02:01.400
Collective bargaining my ass.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.800
It's horse shit.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.400
Okay.
Great exit interview.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.270
Do you have anything else
you'd like to add?

02:08.270 --> 02:11.270
Just that I'll be happy
when this place goes under.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.880
Well, right there with ya.

02:12.880 --> 02:16.010
Good news is, we don't have
too long to wait. Okay.

02:16.010 --> 02:18.080
<i>Department of Answered Prayers.</i>

02:18.080 --> 02:20.350
<i>Reminder to please schedule
your exit interview.</i>

02:20.350 --> 02:23.090
<i>Department of Answered Prayers,
remind...</i>

02:23.090 --> 02:24.550
Not yet.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.560
Let's save
this weird-ass planet.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:14.470 --> 03:15.600
Status?

03:15.610 --> 03:16.940
Four blocks apart

03:16.940 --> 03:18.210
and still drifting.
We need to find a way

03:18.210 --> 03:19.410
to get them back together.

03:19.410 --> 03:20.880
Then we've only got one option:

03:20.880 --> 03:22.140
We fence them in.

03:22.150 --> 03:24.280
We block the roads they're on.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.080
Then we seal off
the side streets

03:26.080 --> 03:28.420
so the only direction they can
move is toward each other.

03:28.420 --> 03:30.690
We corral them like cattle,
closer and closer,

03:30.690 --> 03:31.890
until their lips are touching.

03:31.890 --> 03:33.290
Okay, I'm... I'm not sure

03:33.290 --> 03:35.020
we're gonna be able
to do that, Eliza.

03:35.030 --> 03:36.220
Craig, we can't afford
to play it safe right now.

03:36.230 --> 03:37.690
N-No, I'm not "playing it safe."
I promise.

03:37.690 --> 03:38.890
We... We just don't have
the manpower

03:38.900 --> 03:39.960
to block off all those routes.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.430
You're right.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.500
Yeah, we need help. Let's get
the other departments.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.100
Rosie, Sanjay, you go east,

03:45.100 --> 03:47.170
round up everyone
from Bug Control to Erosion.

03:47.170 --> 03:48.970
We'll go west
and hit up the people

03:48.970 --> 03:50.510
in Currents, Clouds, and Tides.

03:50.510 --> 03:51.710
And I'll help, too.

03:52.580 --> 03:53.980
- Yay.
- Thank you.

03:53.980 --> 03:55.310
You're helping by just being here.
Yeah.

03:55.310 --> 03:56.880
- That's so nice of you.
- Great.

04:06.390 --> 04:07.520
Hello?

04:09.190 --> 04:11.260
Hello?!

04:14.470 --> 04:17.399
Hello?

04:21.470 --> 04:22.670
Where is everyone?

04:22.670 --> 04:24.470
I don't know.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.940
What is that?

04:30.410 --> 04:33.420
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

04:43.290 --> 04:44.830
I got this.

04:46.760 --> 04:48.030
- Oh!
- Oh!

04:48.030 --> 04:49.560
All right, everybody, look.

04:49.570 --> 04:52.030
All of you are technically
still employees here,

04:52.040 --> 04:53.640
at least for the next...

04:53.640 --> 04:55.570
thirty-eight minutes.

04:55.570 --> 04:56.840
So if you don't help us,

04:56.840 --> 04:58.440
you'll be in dereliction
of your duty,

04:58.440 --> 05:02.440
which means a forfeiture
of all severance packages.

05:02.450 --> 05:04.180
Oh, shit.

05:04.180 --> 05:05.450
So go on. Get your gear.

05:05.450 --> 05:06.980
We've got work to do.

05:16.660 --> 05:18.790
Yeah, let's fire it up!

05:18.800 --> 05:20.060
Hey, guys, it's running!

05:20.060 --> 05:21.200
Over here.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.000
<i>12 blocks apart.</i>

05:23.000 --> 05:24.600
- Okay, let's go! Let's go!
- Go, go, go, go!

05:24.600 --> 05:25.470
Go, go, go, go!

05:25.470 --> 05:28.140
I think we got a real shot here.

05:28.140 --> 05:29.740
We just can't afford
any mistakes.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.680
- Aah!
<i>- Lightning initiated.</i>

05:32.680 --> 05:35.140
<i>Lightning.
Lightning.</i>

05:35.150 --> 05:36.410
We've got to get him
out of here.

05:36.410 --> 05:38.410
<i>- Aah!
- Lightning initiated.</i>

05:38.420 --> 05:39.820
<i>More lightning.</i>

05:41.480 --> 05:43.220
<i>18 blocks apart.</i>

05:43.220 --> 05:44.890
<i>19 blocks apart.</i>

05:44.890 --> 05:46.690
Hey, God.
Hey! How are you?

05:46.690 --> 05:48.090
So glad you found us.

05:48.090 --> 05:50.490
Everybody was like,
"Where's God? We need him."

05:50.490 --> 05:52.290
Now, look, I'm...
I'm just glad I could help.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.700
Speaking of which, uh...

05:53.700 --> 05:56.700
we... we actually need
your expertise right now...

05:56.700 --> 05:58.230
In another room.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.300
Really? 'Cause it seems like
all the action's right here.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.370
Oh, no. There's a lot more
action in another room.

06:02.370 --> 06:03.910
Oh, boy.
I want to see that room.

06:03.910 --> 06:05.040
All right.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.310
Lead the way.
All right.

06:06.310 --> 06:08.710
All right, people!
Back to work! Come on!

06:08.710 --> 06:10.110
Let's do this thing!

06:10.110 --> 06:12.510
- Okay, Circuits. You're up.
- All right.

06:14.650 --> 06:16.790
All right!

06:16.790 --> 06:18.720
Nice work.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.790
<i>Sewage initiated.</i>

06:25.460 --> 06:27.930
We're getting there.
Okay, hydrant's on deck.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.800
<i>Hydrant failed.</i>

06:32.800 --> 06:33.940
Damn it!

06:33.940 --> 06:34.940
Come... You guys!

06:34.940 --> 06:36.270
Where were you on that one?!

06:36.270 --> 06:38.140
They were on their break.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.340
We get 5 minutes
every 45 minutes

06:40.340 --> 06:41.880
and 10 minutes every hour.

06:41.880 --> 06:45.210
You got a problem with that,
bring it up at arbitration.

06:45.220 --> 06:47.680
That stupid union.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.080
Now Sam's way off course.

06:49.090 --> 06:51.090
And there's nothing
we can use to block the road.

06:51.090 --> 06:52.690
What about that beehive?

06:54.160 --> 06:56.020
Bug Control!

06:56.030 --> 06:57.360
Can you control bugs?

06:57.360 --> 06:59.290
Not really.
What does that mean?

06:59.300 --> 07:00.760
Well, we got this helmet.

07:00.770 --> 07:04.170
But the last time we tested it,
it didn't work out too hot.

07:04.170 --> 07:05.770
Okay, well, we gotta try it
again right now.

07:05.770 --> 07:07.240
Be my guest.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.370
But before you strap it on,

07:09.370 --> 07:12.370
you might want to have
a little chat with Henry.

07:12.380 --> 07:14.240
He used the helmet six years ago

07:14.240 --> 07:16.710
to try to move a potato bug
away from a potato.

07:16.710 --> 07:18.310
Been that way ever since.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.250
Is he all right?
No.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.650
Best we can figure is,

07:21.650 --> 07:23.920
his mind merged
with the potato bug's mind.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.520
Never really switched back.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.660
Look, we need you to steer
this bee towards Sam.

07:27.660 --> 07:28.720
No way, lady.

07:28.730 --> 07:31.060
I'm not risking my brain
for some severance.

07:38.340 --> 07:39.600
Sorry. Here.
We need this.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.200
No, no. You... Okay.
No, we just need it.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.140
Okay. All right.

07:43.140 --> 07:45.070
Bee me.
What?

07:45.080 --> 07:46.610
Strap it on.
Throw the switch.

07:46.610 --> 07:48.280
Bee me.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.810
Wait. Hang on.

07:49.810 --> 07:51.550
Craig...

07:51.550 --> 07:52.820
are you sure
you want to do this?

07:52.820 --> 07:55.080
We have nineteen minutes
until the Earth is destroyed,

07:55.090 --> 07:57.150
so we can't afford
to play it safe.

07:57.150 --> 07:58.550
Right?

07:58.560 --> 08:00.760
Bee me.

08:00.760 --> 08:01.760
Bee me!

08:01.760 --> 08:02.960
Oh, wait, wait!

08:02.960 --> 08:05.360
Eliza.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.700
If I don't come back,
or if I come back as a bee,

08:07.700 --> 08:09.100
I just want you to know that...

08:09.100 --> 08:10.300
Yeeeaaaghh! Aah!

08:10.300 --> 08:11.570
Craig!

08:13.770 --> 08:14.900
Did it work?

08:14.910 --> 08:16.370
Is he a bee?

08:19.240 --> 08:21.110
Hey, look!

08:21.110 --> 08:22.710
He's doing it,

08:22.710 --> 08:23.710
sort of.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.450
<i>Whoa.</i>

08:32.190 --> 08:33.590
<i>Get...</i>

08:37.590 --> 08:39.059
Yes!

08:39.059 --> 08:41.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:41.400 --> 08:43.130
Get him out.
We're losing him!

08:45.070 --> 08:46.270
Craig.

08:46.270 --> 08:47.800
Craig, are you okay?

08:47.800 --> 08:48.940
Craig!

08:48.940 --> 08:50.000
Craig!

08:50.010 --> 08:51.270
Bzzzzzzzzzz.

08:56.010 --> 08:57.080
I'm joking.

09:00.350 --> 09:02.280
Bzzzzzzzzzz.

09:04.420 --> 09:06.420
So, he's legitimately messed up.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.360
Yep.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.360
Right, everybody,
we're back on track.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.030
Now let's finish the job.

09:12.030 --> 09:14.430
- Yeah.
- Come on.

09:14.430 --> 09:15.630
You heard him.

09:15.630 --> 09:17.170
Break's over!

09:19.700 --> 09:21.040
Man.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.970
I've never walked this far
in my whole entire life.

09:23.970 --> 09:25.570
What am I doing anyway?

09:25.580 --> 09:27.840
Uh, we need you
to pump love in the air

09:27.840 --> 09:29.440
to make the people kiss.

09:29.450 --> 09:31.110
We can do that?

09:31.120 --> 09:33.050
Y-Yes.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.180
We do it right here...

09:35.190 --> 09:39.120
in the Department of Love.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.320
Oh. Makes sense.
Okay.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.330
Sure is a lot
of mammoth stuff in here.

09:46.330 --> 09:48.130
So, this is the Love Machine.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.460
It's a little complex,

09:49.470 --> 09:51.070
but I know you can handle it.

09:51.070 --> 09:52.530
Well, I'll try my best.

09:52.540 --> 09:57.410
So, the trick is to press
this button over and over again

09:57.410 --> 10:00.010
and keep doing that
and just stay here.

10:00.010 --> 10:01.880
I won't let you down.

10:01.880 --> 10:02.610
I love you, buddy.

10:02.610 --> 10:04.350
Okay.
I love you.

10:19.900 --> 10:20.900
Aah!

What's the plan?

14:17.630 --> 14:19.840
Okay, I've located
a pair of rabid pigeons.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.640
I say that we blow
some bread crumbs

14:21.640 --> 14:22.970

14:22.970 --> 14:25.570
The pigeons dive-bomb them,
smash their faces together.

Maybe their lips touch.
I don't know.

14:26.710 --> 14:28.310

Pigeons! Go!

They're cowards.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.080
No, I only wanted to go home

because I thought
you wanted to go home.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.350
Well, I didn't.

15:04.350 --> 15:06.420
Well, why did you say you did?

objectively, it's... not good.

17:07.869 --> 17:10.069

17:10.069 --> 17:11.740

how to be strong.
