WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:02.608
_

00:04.835 --> 00:07.236
Hey, handsome. What's
taking you so long?

00:07.238 --> 00:10.773
I'm making you want it more.

00:13.010 --> 00:14.443
It's working.

00:14.445 --> 00:15.978
We can do it right here

00:15.980 --> 00:18.147
and not walk up stairs...

00:18.149 --> 00:22.818
apply the energy that
we saved to the sex.

00:22.820 --> 00:25.888
The kitchen? So dirty.

00:25.890 --> 00:29.324
Really dirty.

00:31.028 --> 00:33.462
_

00:33.464 --> 00:36.565
The kitchen is so dirty.

00:38.869 --> 00:40.836
Really dirty.

00:40.838 --> 00:42.905
I guess the experiment of waiting to see

00:42.907 --> 00:44.840
if the girls would clean
up after themselves

00:44.842 --> 00:46.675
didn't turn out so hot.

00:46.677 --> 00:50.746
That was a swing and a miss.

00:50.748 --> 00:54.883
I was up all night helping Shea
fill out job applications.

00:54.885 --> 00:57.853
Good. Maybe she'll get a job
and fill up that gas tank.

00:57.855 --> 00:59.722
Apparently they think the flashing red E

00:59.724 --> 01:03.292
stands for "excellent, keep driving."

01:03.294 --> 01:05.427
Well, at least Stella
broke up with Justin.

01:05.429 --> 01:07.362
So that's good.

01:07.364 --> 01:09.765
Although there has been
a lot of rebounding.

01:09.767 --> 01:11.333
High-school guys had the decency

01:11.335 --> 01:12.468
to sneak out the window.

01:12.470 --> 01:14.303
Now they come downstairs,
and I have to pretend

01:14.305 --> 01:16.238
like I don't want to
punch them in the face.

01:18.943 --> 01:22.411
You know what would take
our minds off of this?

01:22.413 --> 01:26.548
Remember that naked thing we used to do?

01:26.550 --> 01:28.050
It has been a while.

01:32.056 --> 01:34.223
Martina Moore.

01:34.225 --> 01:36.024
Hello, Jeremy.

01:36.026 --> 01:37.025
Sorry.

01:37.027 --> 01:38.961
I should take this in my office.

01:38.963 --> 01:42.664
So no naked thing.

01:42.666 --> 01:45.234
- Morning, Dad.
- Hey, sweetie.

01:45.236 --> 01:46.835
I finally got my applications off

01:46.837 --> 01:48.737
to every astrophysics lab I could find.

01:48.739 --> 01:49.905
Oh, well, that's good.

01:49.907 --> 01:52.741
Is it? What if I don't get in anywhere?

01:52.743 --> 01:54.543
Focus on my social life, you say?

01:54.545 --> 01:57.112
I don't think so, 'cause
that's a complete disaster.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.151
Maybe there's some larger perspective

02:02.153 --> 02:04.520
that you could take solace from.

02:04.522 --> 02:05.788
You're right.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.924
Life is short, random, and
ultimately pointless.

02:08.925 --> 02:11.093
There you go.

02:12.663 --> 02:14.530
Oh, hey, guys, what are
you still doing up?

02:14.532 --> 02:15.864
It's morning, Stella.

02:15.866 --> 02:19.568
Oh, that explains a lot.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.470
That's one crazy-looking wig.

02:21.472 --> 02:24.273
- It's not a wig.
- I like it.

02:26.076 --> 02:27.409
Thanks, Dad.

02:27.411 --> 02:28.710
This girl Jessica did it.

02:28.712 --> 02:31.280
We got wasted, and she cut
it, and I honestly think

02:31.282 --> 02:33.048
she's gonna be the next big thing...

02:33.050 --> 02:37.152
not in hairdressing, but in
telling people what to do.

02:38.155 --> 02:39.655
Oh, it's your grandparents.

02:39.657 --> 02:40.823
The new rule is they have to text

02:40.825 --> 02:43.292
before they come over, and
then I can text back...

02:43.294 --> 02:46.762
"Not home."

02:46.764 --> 02:47.863
And send.

02:47.865 --> 02:50.933
I'm a genius.

02:50.935 --> 02:52.434
What do you mean you're not home?

02:52.436 --> 02:54.636
We can see you, genius!

02:57.575 --> 02:58.874
What's the purpose of a text

02:58.876 --> 03:00.309
if you're just gonna barge in anyway?

03:00.311 --> 03:03.378
How should we know? It's your system.

03:03.380 --> 03:06.782
Oh, good Lord, girl, your hair is pink.

03:06.784 --> 03:08.317
I know, right?

03:08.319 --> 03:10.085
Hi, everyone.

03:10.087 --> 03:11.854
Oh, this is my new friend Jessica.

03:11.856 --> 03:14.556
She's completely freegan,
has a sick Instagram,

03:14.558 --> 03:16.458
and she knows Drake.

03:16.460 --> 03:17.659
I don't know

03:17.661 --> 03:20.829
if those are positive
or negative qualities.

03:20.831 --> 03:21.964
Nice to meet all of you.

03:21.966 --> 03:25.434
- Stell, I got to bounce.
- Okay, bye, Jess.

03:31.575 --> 03:34.443
Oh, my God!

03:34.445 --> 03:37.179
You cut your hair!

03:51.996 --> 03:55.530
So, what, you're gay now?

03:55.532 --> 03:57.132
Dad, just because I slept with a girl

03:57.134 --> 03:59.001
doesn't mean I'm a lesbian.

03:59.003 --> 04:02.437
Doesn't it, though?

04:02.439 --> 04:04.039
You know whose fault this is?

04:04.041 --> 04:06.909
The Democrats?

04:06.911 --> 04:08.543
Not this time.

04:08.545 --> 04:09.645
This comes from all that

04:09.647 --> 04:12.381
"everything you do is great" parenting.

04:12.383 --> 04:14.917
Why are you here?

04:14.919 --> 04:17.152
Well, certainly not to
see my granddaughter

04:17.154 --> 04:19.855
kiss somebody else's granddaughter.

04:19.857 --> 04:21.990
Come on, Alice, let's go.

04:21.992 --> 04:24.026
It really is no big deal.

04:24.028 --> 04:26.929
She's right. Sexuality
is very fluid now.

04:26.931 --> 04:29.765
People don't adhere to
specific traditional labels.

04:29.767 --> 04:30.899
What's wrong with labels?

04:30.901 --> 04:33.435
That's how you know what stuff is.

04:33.437 --> 04:37.072
See? This is water.

04:37.074 --> 04:39.675
That's vodka.

04:43.447 --> 04:45.113
I fill it before I go out.

04:45.115 --> 04:47.649
I don't do bar prices.

04:47.651 --> 04:50.852
Great. Thrifty but criminal.

04:50.854 --> 04:52.921
More labels... criminal, gay.

04:52.923 --> 04:54.589
You're so uptight about everything.

04:54.591 --> 04:56.224
I mean, Mom slept with a woman.

04:56.226 --> 04:57.759
- What?
- What?

05:01.665 --> 05:04.366
It was in college before I met you.

05:04.368 --> 05:05.434
It's nothing.

05:05.436 --> 05:07.135
No, it's not nothing if your husband

05:07.137 --> 05:10.272
doesn't know about it,
but your daughters do.

05:10.274 --> 05:12.841
The girls are my friends.

05:12.843 --> 05:14.710
What am I?

05:14.712 --> 05:16.511
Dad, I don't want to boring-shame you,

05:16.513 --> 05:18.780
but your Disney prince would
be Snow White's prince,

05:18.782 --> 05:23.218
and his name was literally
just "The Prince."

05:23.220 --> 05:26.021
You're a little vanilla when
it comes to this stuff.

05:26.023 --> 05:29.958
You are what you eat.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.160
Yeah, yeah, Dad's vanilla,

05:32.162 --> 05:34.429
but we're all cool and gay.

05:36.567 --> 05:38.900
Well, I'm not gay, but maybe
if I were less straight,

05:38.902 --> 05:40.969
it would broaden my opportunities.

05:40.971 --> 05:42.904
I keep telling you to try a dating app.

05:42.906 --> 05:44.639
That's how I met Jessica.

05:44.641 --> 05:46.241
I don't know.

05:46.243 --> 05:47.442
Why can't I just meet somebody

05:47.444 --> 05:49.711
getting stuck in a revolving door

05:49.713 --> 05:51.980
or sharing the same taxi

05:51.982 --> 05:54.449
or having a big conglomerate
open up across the street

05:54.451 --> 05:56.852
from my mom-and-pop bookstore?

05:56.854 --> 05:58.920
And then I meet the head
of the conglomerate,

05:58.922 --> 06:00.489
and darn it if he doesn't drive me crazy

06:00.491 --> 06:03.225
in the beginning...

06:03.227 --> 06:06.695
but then he wins me over.

06:06.697 --> 06:09.331
Mom and I will help you
make a dating profile,

06:09.333 --> 06:11.099
and you've got nothing to worry about.

06:11.101 --> 06:12.567
I've seen you naked, and your boobs

06:12.569 --> 06:15.003
are like two perfect handfuls of perky.

06:15.005 --> 06:16.738
I'm out.

06:19.943 --> 06:21.376
And there's nothing wrong with vanilla.

06:21.378 --> 06:25.247
They're exotic beans, and
their flavor is exquisite.

06:26.583 --> 06:29.851
Oh, so good.

06:32.823 --> 06:35.390
What's bothering you, huh?

06:35.392 --> 06:37.692
Is it that free-love,
hippie-commune thing

06:37.694 --> 06:39.761
you got going on at your place?

06:39.763 --> 06:43.565
You miss Nixon, don't you?

06:43.567 --> 06:46.902
Every day.

06:46.904 --> 06:50.405
Look, you made a big stink that
we should talk more, so talk.

06:50.407 --> 06:52.040
All right, fine.

06:52.042 --> 06:54.309
Martina and I used to have a
good, frequent thing going,

06:54.311 --> 06:56.778
and now that the girls are home,
it's not happening at all.

06:56.780 --> 07:01.650
Wah, wah. Stop crying.
You'll ruin your dress.

07:01.652 --> 07:04.619
I'm sorry, habit. Go on.

07:04.621 --> 07:06.321
So I think I got it figured out.

07:06.323 --> 07:09.357
The girls are poisoning
Martina against me.

07:09.359 --> 07:11.993
They say I'm vanilla.
She sees me as vanilla.

07:11.995 --> 07:14.262
And she doesn't want to
have sex with vanilla.

07:14.264 --> 07:16.264
It's like the old days.
It's three against one.

07:16.266 --> 07:17.432
I wish I had a son.

07:17.434 --> 07:19.835
It isn't that great.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.541
Look, I went through something
similar with your mother,

07:26.543 --> 07:28.877
and it's one of the
reasons why we split up.

07:28.879 --> 07:31.746
She was a free spirit, into
all that New Age crap,

07:31.748 --> 07:34.015
and, well, she saw me as a square cop

07:34.017 --> 07:35.784
who wouldn't try new things.

07:35.786 --> 07:37.352
You can't let this slide, Mike.

07:37.354 --> 07:38.920
You got to spice things up.

07:38.922 --> 07:40.455
How do you propose I do that?

07:40.457 --> 07:43.492
Well, I got some tips from movies.

07:47.397 --> 07:48.463
Movies?

07:48.465 --> 07:49.898
You know...

07:49.900 --> 07:51.566
movies.

07:54.905 --> 07:57.606
Are you talking about porn?

07:57.608 --> 08:00.642
Yeah, but I'm trying
to be a little classy.

08:00.644 --> 08:02.444
All right, you got a
computer, don't you?

08:02.446 --> 08:04.246
You won't believe what they got going on

08:04.248 --> 08:06.548
in that thing.

08:06.550 --> 08:08.083
I know what they got
going on in that thing.

08:08.085 --> 08:09.351
I'm just more of a magazine guy.

08:09.353 --> 08:10.352
I don't need plot.

08:10.354 --> 08:13.989
I don't care how the pizza got there.

08:13.991 --> 08:17.058
Y'all talking about porn?

08:17.060 --> 08:18.360
I have to say, your father became

08:18.362 --> 08:21.129
a much better lover after
we watched a few films.

08:21.131 --> 08:24.099
You have to say that?

08:24.101 --> 08:25.672
It seems like you want to say that.

08:30.305 --> 08:32.773
Okay, ToastUp is the
greatest dating app ever.

08:32.820 --> 08:34.419
So your picture and your profile

08:34.422 --> 08:35.488
are your slice of bread,

08:35.490 --> 08:37.222
and when you match with other slices,

08:37.225 --> 08:39.525
they pop up out of a toaster.

08:39.527 --> 08:43.328
Okay, Shea, how would
you describe your look?

08:43.331 --> 08:46.165
My face is fairly symmetrical,

08:46.167 --> 08:47.867
average height,

08:47.869 --> 08:50.936
hips regrettably boyish.

08:50.938 --> 08:53.472
I'll put "banging."

08:53.474 --> 08:54.573
Personality?

08:54.575 --> 08:57.743
Typical scientist...
methodical, logical.

08:57.745 --> 09:00.446
Brain also "banging."

09:00.448 --> 09:02.481
Okay, for fun, I filled out profiles

09:02.483 --> 09:03.683
for you and Grandma.

09:03.685 --> 09:06.018
- Just open the app.
- But we're married.

09:06.020 --> 09:07.620
Just 'cause you're tied to the fence

09:07.622 --> 09:09.922
doesn't mean you can't bark at the cars.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.696
Ooh, those are your matches.

09:16.698 --> 09:19.999
Well, I guess it wouldn't
hurt to take a look.

09:20.001 --> 09:23.803
Oh, my God, they're all so old.

09:23.805 --> 09:28.374
Oh, look at this fine
Denzel-looking dreamboat.

09:28.376 --> 09:32.411
Ha ha. That's what's out there
looking for me, ladies.

09:32.413 --> 09:33.746
Yeah, he's only a barista,

09:33.748 --> 09:35.381
but that just means he's a go-getter.

09:36.551 --> 09:38.484
Mm, this app is great.

09:40.154 --> 09:43.656
Oh, wait. What's that?
Why is my toast burning?

09:43.658 --> 09:47.059
He's tossing your toast.
He's rejecting you.

09:47.061 --> 09:49.028
Rejecting me?

09:49.030 --> 09:53.265
That broke-ass, ratchet,
pretty-boy mother.

09:53.267 --> 09:54.767
I don't have time for this nonsense.

09:54.769 --> 09:56.769
That app sucks!

09:59.841 --> 10:01.273
More matches, Mom?

10:01.275 --> 10:03.242
No, I created a profile for your dad.

10:04.612 --> 10:06.746
Later we'll laugh about how
we can never leave each other

10:06.748 --> 10:08.481
because it's really bad out there and...

10:08.483 --> 10:13.018
Oh, my God, Mike could get models.

10:13.020 --> 10:17.690
They're, like, 20 years younger
with tattoos and piercings.

10:17.692 --> 10:20.659
Mom, Dad's not going anywhere.
You make him happy.

10:20.661 --> 10:24.063
Yeah. I do make him happy...

10:24.065 --> 10:27.166
though not lately.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.902
Your dad and I are a little out of sync

10:29.904 --> 10:32.037
in the romance department.

10:32.039 --> 10:33.606
Oh, my God.

10:33.608 --> 10:36.642
If you guys split up, where do we live?

10:39.313 --> 10:42.982
But it's Dad, vanilla Dad.

10:42.984 --> 10:46.452
You're right. I'm his vanilla.

10:46.454 --> 10:48.621
He's not interested in young girls.

10:48.623 --> 10:50.756
I'm hot, and I'm 21,

10:50.758 --> 10:52.792
and I live in your neighborhood.

10:52.794 --> 10:56.429
You don't live in my neighborhood.

10:56.431 --> 10:59.498
I would've remembered you.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.001
Ooh, oh, oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

11:04.639 --> 11:08.641
No, no, don't freeze.

11:08.643 --> 11:11.076
Don't freeze on that image!

11:22.490 --> 11:23.756
What are you doing?

11:23.758 --> 11:28.294
Just putting the computer to sleep...

11:28.296 --> 11:32.364
like a parakeet.

11:32.366 --> 11:33.586
Shh.

11:39.602 --> 11:41.403
All right, fine.

11:41.405 --> 11:44.807
I was watching porn in the kitchen

11:44.809 --> 11:48.110
in the middle of the day.

11:48.112 --> 11:52.147
Just one of the many cool,
badass, non-vanilla things

11:52.149 --> 11:54.016
that I do.

11:56.587 --> 12:00.923
Oh, my God, that math on the
chalkboard's all wrong.

12:04.562 --> 12:07.963
That's probably why the
teacher's doing that to her.

12:07.965 --> 12:09.631
All right, girls, upstairs.

12:12.136 --> 12:15.337
Look, I can explain. I'm
not mad about the porn.

12:15.339 --> 12:17.573
I'm just surprised.

12:17.575 --> 12:19.942
Those girls are so young.

12:19.944 --> 12:21.977
And all those piercings?

12:21.979 --> 12:25.614
I didn't even know you
 could pierce that.

12:25.616 --> 12:28.383
Well, I guess it would help you find it.

12:31.789 --> 12:34.056
I didn't think you liked this stuff.

12:34.058 --> 12:38.060
Maybe there are things
about me you don't know.

12:38.062 --> 12:39.795
What are you saying?

12:39.797 --> 12:42.364
I'm just saying, why stick
with boring old vanilla

12:42.366 --> 12:45.167
when there is kiwi out there?

12:47.872 --> 12:49.338
Why are you suddenly interested

12:49.340 --> 12:52.007
in hipper, younger flavors?

12:52.009 --> 12:53.208
I don't know.

12:53.210 --> 12:55.878
Maybe vanilla's getting
a little old for me.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.847
But it goes to the gym all the time!

13:04.421 --> 13:05.921
So my mom wants to get pierced

13:05.923 --> 13:07.456
so she doesn't look so old next to us

13:07.458 --> 13:10.325
and my dad won't leave
her for someone younger.

13:10.327 --> 13:12.127
Oh, my God, coincidence.

13:12.129 --> 13:14.663
Spike dumped his old wife too.

13:14.665 --> 13:16.198
Why did you do that?

13:16.200 --> 13:18.634
Well, she was always
focused on the kids,

13:18.636 --> 13:20.402
even after they grew up.

13:20.404 --> 13:21.837
Well, that sounds like a good mother.

13:21.839 --> 13:24.806
That can be very attractive.

13:24.808 --> 13:26.842
Yeah, but not real hot.

13:26.844 --> 13:28.377
Pierce me.

13:35.085 --> 13:37.386
"At the"...

13:44.962 --> 13:47.296
"Gym."

13:51.435 --> 13:54.002
Bob and I have been discussing
your marital problems,

13:54.004 --> 13:57.239
and we decided maybe we
sent you in a bad direction

13:57.241 --> 13:59.508
regarding the porn thing.

14:01.345 --> 14:03.679
Great timing.

14:05.215 --> 14:07.215
Anyway, Bob wants to tell you something,

14:07.217 --> 14:09.184
but he feels uncomfortable saying it.

14:09.186 --> 14:11.720
This is true.

14:11.722 --> 14:14.156
You got to stop worrying
about being vanilla.

14:14.158 --> 14:16.625
So go out, find her, do something bold,

14:16.627 --> 14:18.160
and rock her world,

14:18.162 --> 14:21.430
'cause the truth of it is,
you got a good marriage,

14:21.432 --> 14:24.166
the kind of marriage you
should be proud of.

14:24.168 --> 14:25.901
And you shouldn't make
the stupid mistakes

14:25.903 --> 14:27.102
your old man made.

14:27.104 --> 14:29.071
There, I said it.

14:34.044 --> 14:38.614
You and me, right here...

14:38.616 --> 14:40.315
right now.

14:41.986 --> 14:46.154
And I'm talking about
sex, if that was unclear.

14:46.156 --> 14:48.824
But we're in session.

14:55.156 --> 14:57.324
That's the ToastUp guy
I picked for Shea.

14:57.445 --> 14:59.178
Doesn't he look like Hozier?

14:59.280 --> 15:02.281
Sure. Why not?

15:02.383 --> 15:04.116
I've never dated
somebody who looked like

15:04.218 --> 15:05.618
a celebrity before...

15:05.720 --> 15:09.455
except for the one who
looked like Galileo.

15:10.105 --> 15:12.472
But, ironically, for someone
who looked like Galileo,

15:12.582 --> 15:15.350
he thought the Sun revolved around him.

15:21.191 --> 15:25.126
I need to be around people
who know that's funny.

15:25.228 --> 15:27.228
I'll get your drinks.

15:27.330 --> 15:28.997
I was hesitant about this at first,

15:29.099 --> 15:31.699
but now I'm really
excited about my date.

15:31.801 --> 15:33.735
You know, it's good for me
to put myself out there,

15:33.837 --> 15:35.904
take the risk, dare to be hurt.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.108
Oh, my God, that doesn't sound good.

15:40.210 --> 15:41.442
What does that noise mean?

15:41.544 --> 15:44.679
Um, that's the toast being scraped off.

15:44.781 --> 15:46.648
It means he's not coming.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.983
I got stood up?

15:49.085 --> 15:50.718
I knew this was gonna happen.

15:50.820 --> 15:52.520
Why did I let you talk me into this?

15:52.622 --> 15:54.022
I was just trying to help you.

15:54.124 --> 15:55.390
It's not just this.

15:55.492 --> 15:57.292
You're always pushing
me to do dumb stuff.

15:57.394 --> 15:58.693
This wasn't dumb, okay?

15:58.795 --> 16:00.028
You took a shot. It didn't work out.

16:00.130 --> 16:01.029
Big deal.

16:01.131 --> 16:02.797
There's no reason to react this bad.

16:02.899 --> 16:05.300
- Badly.
- Ugh.

16:05.402 --> 16:08.036
Don't talk down to me.
You always do that.

16:08.138 --> 16:09.671
That's why we never hung
out in high school.

16:09.773 --> 16:12.106
We didn't hang out
because you excluded me.

16:12.208 --> 16:13.675
You didn't even invite me to parties

16:13.777 --> 16:15.576
when they were in our own house.

16:15.679 --> 16:17.612
I didn't invite you to those
parties because I was...

16:17.714 --> 16:19.514
What? What, you were too cool for me?

16:19.616 --> 16:21.015
- You were embarrassed by me?
- No.

16:21.117 --> 16:22.383
- I was just...
- Well, go ahead, say it.

16:22.485 --> 16:24.585
- Say how you really feel.
- I was jealous of you.

16:24.688 --> 16:26.554
See, I knew you were...

16:29.192 --> 16:30.959
What?

16:31.061 --> 16:34.228
- You were jealous of me?
- Obviously.

16:34.331 --> 16:37.465
I mean, you're basically
as pretty as I am.

16:37.567 --> 16:39.500
But you're also so smart.

16:39.602 --> 16:40.969
You think I wouldn't like to know

16:41.071 --> 16:44.205
what you're saying when you talk?

16:44.307 --> 16:46.574
Well, I was jealous of you

16:46.676 --> 16:48.409
and how much attention you got,

16:48.511 --> 16:50.945
how much Mom and Dad worried about you.

16:51.047 --> 16:52.613
Plus, you were always having fun,

16:52.716 --> 16:54.749
and you always had a million guys.

16:54.851 --> 16:57.418
Well, I also had my heart
broken a million times.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.154
Wow. That's like a one-to-one ratio.

17:01.992 --> 17:05.526
See, I would love to
know what that means.

17:05.627 --> 17:08.061
You know, maybe we should hang out more

17:08.164 --> 17:11.165
now that we have no option
but to hang out more.

17:11.267 --> 17:13.468
Yeah, we totally should.

17:13.569 --> 17:15.369
Hey, let's go home.

17:15.472 --> 17:18.271
Mom and Dad are probably
missing us by now.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.440
- Bye, girls.
- Bye, guys.

17:19.541 --> 17:20.775
Bye, girl.

17:20.877 --> 17:22.676
Oh, my God, Bob, that's him.

17:22.779 --> 17:25.713
That's the guy who burned my toast.

17:25.815 --> 17:27.348
Oh, yeah?

17:27.450 --> 17:28.850
Scotch and soda, please.

17:28.952 --> 17:31.953
Not in my bar, buddy.

17:32.055 --> 17:34.222
That is one beautiful woman right there.

17:34.324 --> 17:37.792
How dare you burn her toast?

17:37.894 --> 17:39.660
Now get the hell out
and do not come back

17:39.763 --> 17:42.163
until you want to nail my wife.

17:45.869 --> 17:48.803
Wow. This is a surprise...

17:48.905 --> 17:54.442
an awesome surprise that
I am totally down with.

17:54.544 --> 17:56.644
You got something on your nose.

17:56.746 --> 17:58.813
I got it pierced, see?

17:58.915 --> 18:00.181
It's a little infected right now,

18:00.283 --> 18:03.484
so you can't see the stud.

18:03.586 --> 18:06.320
That is...

18:06.423 --> 18:08.289
hot?

18:09.692 --> 18:13.494
Hot and dirty... just how you like it.

18:13.596 --> 18:15.830
Yeah, you married a bad girl.

18:15.932 --> 18:17.098
Ooh.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.233
Does this bad girl want
to do it on the desk?

18:19.335 --> 18:21.369
Yeah, baby, the desk,

18:21.471 --> 18:25.206
'cause that couch is so
lame and comfortable.

18:25.308 --> 18:28.142
The desk is edgy. It's got edges.

18:28.244 --> 18:30.845
Let's revisit the couch idea.

18:30.947 --> 18:33.748
The couch... still warm
from Jeremy's behind.

18:33.850 --> 18:35.683
All right.

18:35.785 --> 18:38.386
Hey, not the couch, how about the table?

18:38.488 --> 18:42.323
Ooh, yeah, the table... the
one we assembled ourselves

18:42.425 --> 18:44.125
with all those leftover pieces.

18:44.227 --> 18:48.262
Okay, not the table, but
we've got to decide soon

18:48.364 --> 18:50.965
because my torn meniscus
is absolutely ki...

18:51.067 --> 18:52.934
Oh, oh, God! Oh, God.

18:53.036 --> 18:56.771
What are we doing?

18:56.873 --> 19:00.141
Well, I'm trying not to be vanilla.

19:00.243 --> 19:01.709
What are you doing?

19:01.811 --> 19:04.979
I'm trying to be young and porny.

19:05.081 --> 19:07.482
We are so not these people.

19:07.584 --> 19:09.484
- What's going on with us?
- I don't know.

19:09.586 --> 19:12.186
Ever since the girls came
back, things have changed.

19:12.288 --> 19:13.488
I know, but why?

19:13.590 --> 19:15.323
It's not like they're babies.

19:15.425 --> 19:17.558
Well, they make a mess.
They keep us awake.

19:17.660 --> 19:18.659
They stress us out.

19:18.761 --> 19:21.429
they're babies...

19:21.531 --> 19:24.232
giant babies.

19:24.334 --> 19:26.167
You know what the problem is?

19:26.269 --> 19:30.004
It's like, first we were
girlfriend and boyfriend,

19:30.106 --> 19:31.739
and that was sexy.

19:31.841 --> 19:35.943
And then we got married,
and that was sexy.

19:36.045 --> 19:39.480
- And then we had kids.
- Not sexy.

19:39.582 --> 19:41.182
And then they left,

19:41.284 --> 19:42.884
and we were girlfriend
and boyfriend again,

19:42.986 --> 19:44.519
and that was really sexy.

19:44.621 --> 19:48.289
And then they came back,
and we're parents again.

19:48.391 --> 19:49.624
I want my girlfriend back.

19:49.726 --> 19:53.828
And I want to be your girlfriend...

19:53.930 --> 19:58.533
even if I'm not in my 20s anymore.

19:58.635 --> 20:01.002
Sweetie, listen, I had
this dream one time,

20:01.104 --> 20:05.573
and in this dream, I was
laying in bed next to you.

20:05.675 --> 20:07.542
And then I woke up,

20:07.644 --> 20:11.746
and there you were, laying next to me.

20:11.848 --> 20:16.350
Martina, I can't even dream
anything better than you.

20:18.688 --> 20:21.222
Oh, Mike.

20:22.425 --> 20:25.326
- Mom, Dad.
- We're home!

20:26.663 --> 20:30.264
God, I hate them.

20:30.366 --> 20:33.201
You two have gotten away
with this long enough.

20:33.303 --> 20:36.871
- What?
- Being our daughters.

20:36.973 --> 20:39.440
That ends now.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.609
From now on, we're not parents and kids.

20:41.711 --> 20:44.345
We are adults roommates living together.

20:44.447 --> 20:46.314
You need to clean up,
shop for your own food,

20:46.416 --> 20:47.682
put gas in the car.

20:47.784 --> 20:49.550
Do we have to pay rent?

20:49.652 --> 20:52.186
We're not delusional.

20:52.288 --> 20:53.354
And now, adult roomies,

20:53.456 --> 20:55.656
I'm gonna bang this
hot chick I'm dating.

20:55.758 --> 20:58.993
- You, upstairs.
- Yes, sir.

20:59.095 --> 21:00.561
You two, get a room.

21:00.663 --> 21:02.897
We've got a room. You get a house.
