WEBVTT

00:02.719 --> 00:08.257
Faded.
Just as David defeated Goliath,
our choir defeated...

00:08.309 --> 00:12.061
our own limited potential
to bring home this trophy...

00:12.096 --> 00:13.211
Most Improved!

00:14.682 --> 00:17.566
This anthem is a reminder
that we are all winners

00:17.601 --> 00:18.717
in God's eyes.

- I don't know
the account password.

01:55.399 --> 01:58.567
My wife did the online shopping.

01:58.602 --> 02:02.104
No, she cannot come to the
phone, she's busy being dead.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.389
I don't need your sorrys... I
need you to reset the password

02:04.408 --> 02:05.891
so I can order a can opener

02:05.910 --> 02:08.577
and get back to staring into
the meaningless abyss

02:08.612 --> 02:10.078
of my own future.

02:10.114 --> 02:12.664
It is a bleak worldview,
Chelsea.

02:18.122 --> 02:20.172
Chelsea, I gotta put you
on hold.

02:22.459 --> 02:24.293
- How's your new place, Wayne?

02:24.345 --> 02:27.930
- Living alone is awesome
times radical times infinity.

02:27.965 --> 02:30.749
I get to make dinner for two
and then eat both.

02:30.768 --> 02:32.017
- Living the dream.

02:32.052 --> 02:35.103
- So you two aren't roommates
anymore?

02:35.139 --> 02:36.421
- No.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.307
I was just crashing
on Dwayne's sofa

02:38.359 --> 02:41.360
while he plotted how to
seduce my wife.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.278
- I thought you guys were done.

02:43.314 --> 02:45.981
- Well, then,
that makes it okay.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.984
Here we go.
Mmm.

02:49.036 --> 02:51.436
Oh.
I thought you were done.

02:51.455 --> 02:54.156
Let's just go back
to the way things were.

02:56.076 --> 02:59.244
There.
It's like it never happened.

03:01.131 --> 03:03.131
- That was the last
gluten-free option.

03:03.167 --> 03:05.000
- Oh no.
Did I miss the service?

03:05.052 --> 03:06.363
I must've gotten the time wrong.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.786
That's too bad.
Let's get started.

03:07.805 --> 03:08.754
- See?

03:08.789 --> 03:10.455
I told y'all just because he
missed church

03:10.474 --> 03:12.457
didn't mean he
was moving back to Princeton.

03:12.476 --> 03:13.675
Or was dead in a ditch.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.426
- We can dream.

03:14.461 --> 03:15.460
- Not very big if you live here.

03:15.479 --> 03:19.130
Lucky for you, I am here
and I am taking this choir

03:19.149 --> 03:20.298
to the regional competition.

03:20.317 --> 03:21.567
Regionals?

03:21.602 --> 03:22.746
- I thought we didn't qualify.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.237
- You didn't, but the Kentucky
Choral Commission thought

03:25.272 --> 03:28.690
that a director of my caliber
would add

03:28.742 --> 03:32.143
interest and... what was it?
Yeah, prestige to the event.

03:32.162 --> 03:34.329
- It's the story of
underdogs triumphing.

03:34.365 --> 03:36.498
Like, uh, Emilio Estevez's
hockey team

03:36.533 --> 03:38.333
in the movie my missionary
parents called

03:38.369 --> 03:40.652
"Ducks are Mighty,
but Not as Mighty as God."

03:40.671 --> 03:41.587
- Amen.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.589
- Don't get on the wrong side
of a duck.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.590
- I can see the headlines now.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.843
"Maestro in Exile Brings
Culture to Bumpkins."

03:47.878 --> 03:50.379
- I'm super excited for you
to exploit us

03:50.431 --> 03:52.047
for your own personal gain,

03:52.099 --> 03:54.383
but try to avoid
harmful stereotypes.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.167
- How 'bout we just win
a real award?

03:56.186 --> 03:58.220
I've already chosen the song.

03:58.272 --> 04:01.440
It is "Ave Maria."

04:01.475 --> 04:04.276
The beauty of this arrangement
is its simplicity...

04:04.311 --> 04:08.013
Basic harmonies beneath
a soprano solo.

04:08.032 --> 04:09.698
We will hold auditions.

04:09.733 --> 04:12.350
Who knows, maybe this'll be fun.

04:17.074 --> 04:19.357
I'm not ready... can somebody
else go before me?

04:21.378 --> 04:25.030
♪ Ah ♪

04:25.049 --> 04:27.916
♪ Ve Maria ♪

04:27.968 --> 04:30.035
- It is a melisma miasma.

04:30.054 --> 04:31.803
- Thank you.

04:31.839 --> 04:32.871
- Not a compliment.

04:34.725 --> 04:40.896
♪ Ave ♪

04:40.931 --> 04:42.064
Line?

04:42.099 --> 04:44.266
- Maria!

04:45.903 --> 04:48.403
Why are you freaking out?
You sing here all the time.

04:48.439 --> 04:49.888
- Well, never alone.

04:49.907 --> 04:52.223
Even in my head,
I don't sing by myself.

04:52.242 --> 04:53.470
- What do you mean
"in your head"?

04:53.494 --> 04:57.079
- Well, in my head there's
really good singers and a band.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.921
It's not a drum solo.

05:05.956 --> 05:07.589
- Until now.

05:08.459 --> 05:10.258
- They all sucked.

05:10.294 --> 05:12.761
They think coloratura
means belting like

05:12.796 --> 05:15.464
Idina Menzel in
that ice princess song.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.682
- "Let It Go."

05:16.717 --> 05:17.632
- I can't.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.151
I may have fallen from grace,

05:19.186 --> 05:21.103
but I'm still
at the top of my game.

05:21.138 --> 05:22.420
- Okay, Rick Pitino.

05:22.439 --> 05:25.140
- My magnum opus
might still be ahead of me.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.809
- You might find some musical
talent at our open mic night.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.945
There was a dog
that plays a piano.

05:29.980 --> 05:32.447
Ironically,
he is not named Beethoven.

05:32.483 --> 05:35.767
- What's ironic is me thinking
that I might find talent

05:35.786 --> 05:38.737
worthy of my skills
in this backwater.

06:45.838 --> 06:47.589

who gets the solo?

06:47.624 --> 06:50.258
We gave you all night to,
in your words, "drink on it."

06:50.294 --> 06:51.294
- Ginny.

06:51.345 --> 06:52.410
- What?

06:52.429 --> 06:53.745
- She didn't even audition.

06:53.764 --> 06:55.413
- Because I don't want a solo.

06:55.432 --> 06:56.659
- Well, this isn't about
what you want.

06:56.683 --> 06:57.749
It's about what I need.

06:57.768 --> 07:00.185
And I need a secret weapon.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.469
- Weapon?
We in a war?

07:01.521 --> 07:02.687
- We are in a war.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.307
We are in a war
against mediocrity,

07:05.359 --> 07:07.091
against crudity,

07:07.110 --> 07:09.761
against wearing tennis shoes
at your wedding.

07:09.780 --> 07:11.813
- You can't wear dress shoes
with shorts.

07:11.865 --> 07:15.116
- Most Improved is not an award.

07:15.152 --> 07:18.153
It's an indictment of how bad
you used to be.

07:18.205 --> 07:21.439
Imagine the possibility of
achieving actual greatness.

07:21.458 --> 07:24.709
And for that, we need a soloist
with range and vibrato,

07:24.745 --> 07:25.877
and that is Ginny.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.162
- I don't like the spotlight.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.113
- We don't like to elevate
the individual

07:29.132 --> 07:30.966
at the expense of the community.

07:31.001 --> 07:32.695
Like, if someone needs
an emotional boost,

07:32.719 --> 07:35.286
they get a solo.

07:35.305 --> 07:37.172
Karla's cat is missing.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.791
- If Ginny doesn't want it,
she won't do a good job.

07:39.810 --> 07:42.344
Besides, I have
a five octave range.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.012
- From middle C down.

07:44.064 --> 07:44.813
You're an alto.

07:44.848 --> 07:46.264
- You're an alto.

07:47.351 --> 07:48.683
- Where's Ginny?

07:49.987 --> 07:53.688
Everyone's missing.

07:58.028 --> 07:59.694
- Why'd you run off and hide?

07:59.746 --> 08:01.329
- I get nervous, okay?

08:01.365 --> 08:03.314
I mean, it's one thing to sing
with the group,

08:03.333 --> 08:05.500
but alone in front of a crowd?

08:05.535 --> 08:07.752
I mean, my heart races,
I get dizzy,

08:07.788 --> 08:09.987
and then I sweat
straight through my clothes.

08:10.007 --> 08:12.340
I had to bring three white
dresses to my confirmation.

08:12.376 --> 08:14.325
- Okay, sit here.
Sit.

08:14.344 --> 08:15.993
Sit, close your eyes.

08:16.013 --> 08:19.931
- I want you to imagine
that you and I are miners,

08:19.966 --> 08:21.383
trapped in a cave-in.

08:21.435 --> 08:22.834
- Where am I?
- School.

08:22.853 --> 08:24.502
- Can I be in the cave?
- Fine.

08:24.521 --> 08:29.006
There is a huge boulder between
us and the sunshine of life.

08:29.026 --> 08:30.725
What do we do?

08:30.777 --> 08:32.894
- We pray.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.289
Oh, and then, if it comes to it,

08:34.313 --> 08:35.864
you eat my body
so you can survive.

08:35.899 --> 08:38.732
- No.
We move the boulder.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.235
Anxiety is treatable.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.620
There's exercises,
there are even drugs.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.407
- My health insurance considers
treating his dyslexia

08:45.459 --> 08:46.908
as an elective procedure.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.411
So I'm guessing
it's not covered.

08:49.463 --> 08:50.745
It is what it is.

08:50.797 --> 08:53.748
- So you just wanna sit
in the cave and die?

08:53.800 --> 08:54.866
- It's not a real cave.

08:54.885 --> 08:57.719
- Well, it is to me.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.308
- We're gonna eat him first,
right?

09:03.343 --> 09:05.310
- Definitely.

09:08.899 --> 09:11.766
- Wayne, what brings you here?

09:11.818 --> 09:13.101
Like this?

09:13.153 --> 09:15.553
- Sorry, Jax, thought
everyone had gone.

09:15.572 --> 09:17.238
I was just getting comfy,
you know.

09:17.274 --> 09:21.659
I like to sleep in
the old Adam and Eve tuxedo.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.661
- Uh, Y-you're sleeping here?

09:23.697 --> 09:25.229
I thought you had
a new apartment.

09:25.248 --> 09:26.248
- That was a lie.

09:26.283 --> 09:29.501
No, I don't have the money
to go anywhere else,

09:29.536 --> 09:32.120
but I couldn't stand living
with that traitor Dwayne.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.289
- I know you're angry,
but he's still your friend.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.206
- He is not a friend.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.925
- Could you please
put your clothes on?

09:36.960 --> 09:38.910
Even Adam had a fig leaf.

09:38.929 --> 09:40.077
- Oh, yeah, sure.
Hey, you want a beer?

09:40.097 --> 09:41.245
- No.
- Some pie?

09:41.264 --> 09:42.264
- I'm okay.

09:42.299 --> 09:44.026
- I got a little chicken fried
steak over here...

09:44.050 --> 09:46.634
- No, could you just put
some clothes on?

09:46.686 --> 09:48.269
- That's the letter "L."

09:48.305 --> 09:49.754
Next step "M."

09:49.773 --> 09:51.973
Do you wanna be the first hump
or the second hump?

09:52.025 --> 09:54.692
- I wanna be dumb in peace.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.778
- You are not dumb.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.980
You have dyslexia,
and the website said

09:59.032 --> 10:00.626
that making letters
in new ways will help.

10:00.650 --> 10:03.100
- What's the point?
I'll never be good at school.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.904
It's like you and stage fright.
It is what it is.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.827
Can I talk to you?

10:12.879 --> 10:14.496
- I can't come to the door.

10:14.548 --> 10:18.299
I'm trapped under the boulder
of my life going nowhere.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.139
- Did you think you could open
a can with a blowtorch?

10:24.174 --> 10:28.560
- I thought the pressure
difference... y'know, science.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.346
- Do we know what
he's a doctor of?

10:32.232 --> 10:34.065
- I'm ready to deal
with my anxiety.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.683
I wanna sing the solo.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.018
- Really?

10:37.070 --> 10:39.020
- Cash needs to see
it's possible to change,

10:39.072 --> 10:40.488
no matter what your issues are.

10:40.524 --> 10:43.307
- And what are your issues?

10:43.326 --> 10:44.359
Withholding mother?

10:44.411 --> 10:46.161
Big sister got
all the attention?

10:46.196 --> 10:48.029
- I see what you're doing here

10:48.081 --> 10:50.615
and your liberal talk therapy's
not gonna work on me.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.650
I guess part of me wondered

10:52.669 --> 10:55.420
if I had any talent,
would my father have stayed?

10:55.455 --> 10:57.839
I mean, obviously he was having
problems with my mother.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.841
But that could've been my
fault, too.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.492
No, Ginny, stop it.

11:01.511 --> 11:04.879
Women of her generation
had limited options.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.831
- You broke my mom.

11:06.850 --> 11:09.217
- Not yet, but we'll get there.

11:11.438 --> 11:12.504
- Did you lose something?

11:12.539 --> 11:14.772
- Yeah, but they'll come back
when they're hungry.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.224
- They?
- It's cool.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.226
They're not venomous,
they're just hangry.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.445
- Reverend, you back there?

11:20.480 --> 11:21.646
- Oh, crap.
It's Dwayne.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.065
- This is a great opportunity
for you guys to clear the air,

11:24.117 --> 11:26.851
heal your wounds,
and move back in together.

11:26.870 --> 11:28.786
- It's not gonna happen.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.049
I don't want him to know
I'm living here.

11:30.073 --> 11:31.166
You gotta keep my secrets,
right?

11:31.190 --> 11:33.458
Because of the whole
attorney-customer pilgrimage.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.326
- That's exactly right.

11:36.046 --> 11:38.580
Dwayne!
Hey.

11:38.632 --> 11:41.466
Looking tall.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.533
Doing anything new?

11:42.552 --> 11:46.421
- I need to talk... oh, are you
expecting company?

11:46.473 --> 11:50.975
- No, no, I'm just sampling
some communion alternatives.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.428
- Well, don't let me stop you.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.104
Nope, stick to the wine.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.355
What can I help you with?

12:04.390 --> 12:07.242
- So I tell him I'm thinking
about asking Ginny to the prom.

12:07.277 --> 12:09.744
The next thing I know,
he asks her.

12:09.779 --> 12:11.446
- No.
- Yeah.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.249
And then he has the nerve to
ask me to be the best man

12:14.284 --> 12:16.117
at the wedding.
- What did you say?

12:16.169 --> 12:17.452
- I said yeah.
- No.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.954
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.625
- Ah!

12:23.677 --> 12:24.759
- Something wrong?

12:24.794 --> 12:25.794
- No.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.178
- You sure?

12:27.213 --> 12:28.463
- Yes.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.131
Continue.

12:30.183 --> 12:33.017
- Something allowed you to
conquer your anxiety

12:33.053 --> 12:34.919
that night in the diner.

12:34.938 --> 12:35.970
- I was alone.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.773
- Wrong, I was watching you.
You just didn't know it.

12:38.808 --> 12:40.591
- Weird.

12:40.610 --> 12:43.144
- What else was going on?
What was in your head?

12:43.196 --> 12:46.781
- I mean, I was imagining
I was Dolly Parton.

12:46.816 --> 12:48.599
- There it is.

12:48.618 --> 12:51.703
You wanna beat your fear?
Create an alter ego.

12:54.824 --> 13:01.913
<i>♪ ♪</i>

13:06.836 --> 13:09.337
- Oh.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.838
Sorry.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.006
- Tough start.

13:15.643 --> 13:17.322
- I shouldn't have apologized
to him.

13:17.346 --> 13:20.014
.Ugh, and my bra's wet
and I haven't washed it

13:20.066 --> 13:21.066
in at least a month.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.516
- That's Ginny talking.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.134
Let's tap into that alter ego.

13:24.153 --> 13:26.870
Who is this inner diva?

13:26.906 --> 13:29.189
- Darlianna Woodbeam.

13:29.241 --> 13:31.658
The strip miner's daughter.

13:31.694 --> 13:35.362
She was discovered in a Florida
mall while on vacation

13:35.414 --> 13:37.865
with her friend's family
'cause her real parents

13:37.917 --> 13:39.583
couldn't afford to
buy her a ticket.

13:39.618 --> 13:41.168
- This is very specific.
It's good.

13:41.203 --> 13:42.169
- Thank you.

13:42.204 --> 13:43.537
I'm thirsty.

13:43.589 --> 13:45.205
Uh, normally I would get
a white wine.

13:45.257 --> 13:46.507
- But?

13:46.542 --> 13:49.659
- Darlianna needs a daiquiri.

13:49.678 --> 13:51.495
Oh, I didn't ask you
if you wanted anything.

13:51.514 --> 13:55.182
Oh, Darlianna only cares
about herself.

13:55.217 --> 13:56.383
I'll get you bourbon.

13:56.435 --> 13:57.334
- Make it a double.

13:57.353 --> 13:58.519
- Mm-hmm.

13:58.554 --> 14:01.355
- Hey, Arthur, we got your text.

14:01.390 --> 14:03.006
"Pop's Paddock, urgent."

14:03.025 --> 14:06.009
- Some of us were concerned.
Some of us were thirsty.

14:06.028 --> 14:08.028
- The entire
UK basketball team is here.

14:08.064 --> 14:10.230
I'm kidding, they're not.

14:10.282 --> 14:11.865
But that is exactly
the energy I need.

14:11.901 --> 14:14.368
I'm buying you drinks 'cause
I need you cheering Ginny.

14:14.403 --> 14:15.702
There's nothing harder

14:15.738 --> 14:17.215
than singing
in front of your friends.

14:17.239 --> 14:18.372
If she can get through this,

14:18.407 --> 14:20.602
she'll have the confidence to
compete in the regionals.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.459
So go.
Get yourselves lubricated.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.106
- Not cool about the Wildcats.
- You're welcome.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.546
- Oh, hey buddy.

14:25.581 --> 14:26.975
Told you not to worry
about that bite.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.715
Milk snakes are non-venomous.

14:28.751 --> 14:31.535
Yeah, maybe you wanna sterilize
that one more time.

14:31.554 --> 14:33.303
Anything over 100 proof
should work.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.722
Oh, also... and
this shouldn't happen...

14:35.758 --> 14:37.558
But if your fingernails
start to fall out

14:37.593 --> 14:39.309
and you sort of die
for a minute,

14:39.345 --> 14:41.265
you were bit by a
different snake than I thought.

14:42.898 --> 14:43.981
- Alcohol.

14:44.016 --> 14:47.568
- Reverend Jax is jum-py.

14:47.603 --> 14:49.915
And he's been drinking in the
middle of the day by himself.

14:49.939 --> 14:53.240
- Lucky for him
AA meets at the church.

14:54.326 --> 14:57.828
- Hey, farm nerd,
whistle something with words!

14:58.998 --> 14:59.998
- You're up next.

15:00.032 --> 15:00.998
- I am?
- Mm-hmm.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.233
- Oh, well if anybody's ready
to go before me...

15:03.252 --> 15:04.401
- Come on, you got this.

15:04.420 --> 15:07.087
You didn't douse yourself
in cheap perfume for nothing.

15:07.123 --> 15:08.238
- That's my good perfume.

15:08.257 --> 15:09.406
- No, really?

15:09.425 --> 15:12.843
- You know what, at least
I took the trouble to shower.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.012
People who live
in filthy glass houseboats

15:15.047 --> 15:16.079
should not throw stones.

15:16.098 --> 15:17.159
- Hey, I tried to hire a maid.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.081
People get suspicious

15:18.100 --> 15:19.820
when you ask them
to bring a bunch of bleach

15:19.852 --> 15:21.496
down to the old houseboat
at the end of the road.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.603
- You live like a pig,

15:22.638 --> 15:24.616
and you look down your nose at
people who have problems

15:24.640 --> 15:25.700
that are not
of their own making.

15:25.724 --> 15:27.307
- Okay, look, you're nervous

15:27.359 --> 15:28.620
and you're trying
to start a fight.

15:28.644 --> 15:29.860
It's called deflection.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.812
- Oh, well, your beard is dumb.

15:31.864 --> 15:34.481
- Well, least the only person
you're failing is yourself.

15:34.533 --> 15:35.983
Oh, and your son.

15:39.738 --> 15:42.772
- My butt whistles
better than you!

15:42.791 --> 15:44.608
- Excuse me, excuse me.

15:44.627 --> 15:46.043
Can I get a shot
of grain alcohol?

15:47.079 --> 15:48.162
Make it a double.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.280
- I'm saving you from yourself.

15:50.299 --> 15:51.965
- Wait, no.

15:52.001 --> 15:54.668
No, I need it, please!

16:01.927 --> 16:03.510
- Uh... hm.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.541
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

16:06.565 --> 16:08.515
It's the most natural thing
in the world.

16:09.768 --> 16:11.852
I know you're in there.

16:11.904 --> 16:14.071
I can see your hair
over the door.

16:14.106 --> 16:15.239
- What is your problem?

16:15.274 --> 16:17.307
- Come on, you can do this.

16:17.326 --> 16:19.910
- You don't know how scary it
is to put yourself out there,

16:19.945 --> 16:21.311
Mr. Fancy Professor.

16:21.330 --> 16:22.829
- Dr. Fancy Professor.

16:22.865 --> 16:25.365
- Exactly, what do you know
about feeling like dirt?

16:29.622 --> 16:32.673
- Every morning I open my eyes,

16:32.708 --> 16:36.043
and for a second I think
I'm gonna see Jean

16:36.095 --> 16:37.844
lying next to me.

16:37.880 --> 16:41.014
Getting my feet out of that
bed, onto the ground,

16:41.050 --> 16:43.884
is the hardest thing
I do every day.

16:43.936 --> 16:48.689
Only time I don't wish I was
dead is when I'm making music.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.343
It's the only thing
keeping me alive.

16:54.813 --> 16:57.814
- Holy, that is dark.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.119
Of course.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.371
You keep coaching choirs
'cause you don't know

17:04.406 --> 17:05.689
how to do anything else.

17:05.708 --> 17:07.051
- It's not coaching,
it's conducting.

17:07.076 --> 17:09.242
- You keep pushing us
to win this competition

17:09.295 --> 17:11.545
because it's a challenge
that you're equipped to face,

17:11.579 --> 17:12.746
unlike the rest of your life.

17:12.798 --> 17:15.715
- You know what, I don't need
your liberal talk therapy.

17:15.751 --> 17:18.367
- Hey, I know
what it's like to be alone.

17:18.387 --> 17:20.053
But you got friends.

17:20.089 --> 17:22.539
You got a whole choir of people
who will show up for you,

17:22.558 --> 17:23.890
anytime you need.

17:23.925 --> 17:27.094
- They already did.
Now I need you to show up.

17:28.396 --> 17:30.063
Or Darlianna.

17:30.099 --> 17:31.932
Dealer's choice.

17:42.353 --> 17:45.404
- That was Ephram and his
20-minute whistling journey

17:45.406 --> 17:46.739
through American history.

17:48.076 --> 17:51.794
Next, give it up for
Miss Darlianna Woodbeam.

17:56.751 --> 17:58.634
- Oh, thank God she's using
the stage name.

17:58.636 --> 18:00.386
Ginny's pretty basic.

18:06.811 --> 18:08.477
<i>- Dwayne, put me down.</i>

18:10.098 --> 18:12.431
This is the wrong direction...
- I know you're an alcoholic.

18:12.433 --> 18:13.983
- What?

18:13.985 --> 18:15.651
- But I wouldn't be much of
a friend if I allowed you

18:15.653 --> 18:16.602
to keep living a lie like that.

18:16.604 --> 18:19.054
- That's a lot of big talk
from a guy who lied

18:19.056 --> 18:20.722
to his best friend
for ten years.

18:20.724 --> 18:21.991
- I told you I...
- Enough!

18:21.993 --> 18:24.610
I can't be in the middle
of this any longer.

18:24.612 --> 18:27.079
Wayne's too proud to tell you
that he's living at the church.

18:27.081 --> 18:28.914
- Wayne.

18:31.919 --> 18:34.503
- You got this!

18:37.758 --> 18:40.843
This one's for the people

we're friends.

19:14.712 --> 19:16.778
We were friends.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.831

You're not a couple.

19:18.833 --> 19:21.283
But you're not just friends,

19:21.285 --> 19:23.886
You're family.

20:41.632 --> 20:43.382
You are a soloist.

20:43.384 --> 20:45.634
And a mediocre piano player,
at best.

20:45.636 --> 20:47.035
Who else can play?

20:47.037 --> 20:49.438
See what you can do

20:49.440 --> 20:51.240

It's just a little thank you
gift from me and Cash.

20:53.527 --> 20:56.195
- A manual can opener.
Is that all I'm worth?

20:56.197 --> 20:57.363
- Well, get us through regionals

20:57.365 --> 20:58.725
and I'll buy you
an electric one.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.700
- All right,
that's the last of it.

21:01.702 --> 21:03.786
I'm officially ready
to move back in.

21:03.788 --> 21:05.153
- Come on, buddy.

21:05.155 --> 21:06.872
- It makes my heart glad to see

21:06.874 --> 21:08.156
you are back to being roommates.

21:08.158 --> 21:10.325
Like Bert and Ernie
in that kid's show

21:10.327 --> 21:12.595
"It's Okay If You're Gay
If You Don't Acknowledge It."

21:13.831 --> 21:16.164
- Haven't seen it.

21:16.166 --> 21:17.967
- Were Bert and Ernie gay?

21:17.969 --> 21:19.368
- Totally.
