<i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:02.302 --> 00:03.504
JILL: Everything out
of your mouth is

00:03.504 --> 00:05.138
mean and hurtful.

00:05.138 --> 00:07.174
ASHLEE: You're just jealous
that Brynn has had

00:07.174 --> 00:08.342
a better season
than Kendall.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.977
Abby, I am not
allowing this woman

00:09.977 --> 00:13.380
to talk to my child like that!
Why are you so mean?!

00:13.380 --> 00:14.548
You dressed your kid up
like JoJo.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.416
Just goes too far.

00:16.416 --> 00:17.284
Let's move on.

00:17.284 --> 00:18.552
<i>No one'll ever be Maddie.</i>

00:18.552 --> 00:20.521
Just saying.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.156
Maddie, Mackenzie and I,
we're moving on.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.427
ABBY LEE: <i>Building a mini team</i>

00:27.427 --> 00:29.162

ASHLEE:
<i>You know that</i>

00:39.039 --> 00:40.474
nobody's gonna be nice to you,
right?

00:41.508 --> 00:42.876
MARY: Those moms
need to be done,

00:42.876 --> 00:44.878
because they all have
their horrible hair extensions

00:44.878 --> 00:46.480
and all their Botox.
Yes. Yes.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.316
Uh, you'd only wish
to be even half of me.

00:49.316 --> 00:51.018
Old news.
Bitch.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.419

00:59.192 --> 01:00.894
Hey, Abby, I heard
you called us all trash.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.763

01:02.763 --> 01:04.031

02:19.740 --> 02:21.908
YOLANDA: <i>Just a little over</i>

02:21.908 --> 02:24.911
<i>a text that Abby had wanted us</i>
<i>to come</i>

02:24.911 --> 02:29.816
<i>and be a part of the team,</i>
<i>and we were beyond elated.</i>

02:29.816 --> 02:31.184
Elliana brings
a lot of strength.

02:31.184 --> 02:33.487
She's strong
in many, many genres.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.022
<i>I think</i>
<i>the ultimate consequence</i>

02:35.022 --> 02:36.690
<i>if she doesn't do well</i>
<i>is that Abby could say,</i>

02:36.690 --> 02:38.258
<i>"You're not worthy</i>
<i>of this team."</i>

02:38.258 --> 02:40.761
So there's a tremendous amount
of pressure on Elliana

02:40.761 --> 02:42.095
because we're not

02:42.095 --> 02:43.497

02:43.497 --> 02:45.265
<i>Nobody is at this point.</i>

No, no, no, no.

You guys have
to understand,

we spent thousands of dollars
to come out here.
No, but who are you?

03:00.480 --> 03:02.716
We've given up a lot.

SARI: <i>I definitely feel like</i>
<i>Abby likes the girls.</i>

06:15.508 --> 06:18.979
Otherwise, she would not be
inviting them back.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.281
<i>But Abby is obviously annoyed</i>

06:21.281 --> 06:23.550

<i>So we need to show Abby</i>
<i>that we want</i>

06:27.254 --> 06:29.356

06:29.356 --> 06:31.458

06:31.458 --> 06:32.659
So,

06:32.659 --> 06:36.363
my junior elite
competition team,

06:36.363 --> 06:39.499
your group routine...
is entitled

06:39.499 --> 06:41.067
"The Atlantic."

06:41.067 --> 06:42.869
(girls oohing)

06:42.869 --> 06:45.538

the ocean.

06:45.538 --> 06:46.907
All right, we have

06:46.907 --> 06:47.774
two solos.

06:49.175 --> 06:53.246
The first solo is
going to Maddie.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.282
Maddie, your solo

06:55.282 --> 06:58.218
is going to be
a musical theater number.

06:58.218 --> 07:02.622
The name of this piece
is "The Entertainer."

07:03.623 --> 07:06.927
It's a musical theater number?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.962
Of course I'm a little nervous.

07:08.962 --> 07:12.365
<i>This could be the last solo</i>
<i>that Maddie's gonna do before</i>

07:12.365 --> 07:14.267
<i>we leave the team,</i>
<i>so it has to be a great one.</i>

07:14.267 --> 07:18.138
<i>And musical theater typically</i>
<i>is pretty simple choreography,</i>

07:18.138 --> 07:21.541
<i>so I don't know</i>
<i>what Abby's thinking.</i>

07:21.541 --> 07:24.945
My next solo is entitled
"Broken Dancer,"

07:24.945 --> 07:28.515
and it's about the homeless
children of Los Angeles.

07:28.515 --> 07:32.118
So, Maddie, I wanted
you to do this piece.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.420
However,

07:33.420 --> 07:34.821
you've already done
a homeless piece.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.323
"All God's Creatures."

07:36.323 --> 07:39.926
♪ Slips into the liquid

07:41.328 --> 07:45.365

and give to Brynn.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.167
(applause)

07:48.234 --> 07:50.036
Brynn, no one

07:50.036 --> 07:51.438
would ever argue
that you can dance.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.206
I doubt that
you can act.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.607
COURTNEY: You're a great dancer.
What's gonna be

07:54.607 --> 07:56.743
the next level for you
is the acting.

07:57.944 --> 08:01.948
ABBY LEE: So I need you
to learn from this.

08:01.948 --> 08:04.451
And this piece,
if it's done well,

08:04.451 --> 08:06.586
will send a message,
loud and clear.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.655
I want the mothers

08:08.655 --> 08:10.857
to be very conscious

08:10.857 --> 08:13.393
when you're talking
about things like,

08:13.393 --> 08:15.929
"Oh, well, Brynn's doing
one of Maddie's numbers

08:15.929 --> 08:17.063
"and Brynn's gonna
look like Maddie

08:17.063 --> 08:18.298
and blah‐blah‐blah‐blah‐blah."
Well, she is.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.569
JoJo can act circles
around Brynn!

08:22.569 --> 08:24.838
You know why she can't
dance circles around Brynn?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.639
Because you don't give her
the time that you give Brynn.

08:26.639 --> 08:29.242
Same with all
these other kids.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.243
Brynn has had 50 solos!

08:30.243 --> 08:31.578
ASHLEE:
<i>Jess needs to shut</i>

37:37.055 --> 37:38.356
<i>Will the judges like her?</i>

37:38.356 --> 37:39.357
<i>Hope so.</i>

37:39.357 --> 37:41.593
Fourth place is number 42,

37:41.593 --> 37:43.394
"Decision."

37:45.396 --> 37:46.297
Third place...

37:49.134 --> 37:52.103
...entry number 96,
"Broken Dancer."

37:52.103 --> 37:54.439
(applause)

37:57.375 --> 37:58.676
MELISSA:
<i>Dressing Brynn like Maddie</i>

37:58.676 --> 38:00.178
<i>isn't gonna have her</i>
<i>dance like Maddie.</i>

38:00.178 --> 38:02.981
<i>Or act like Maddie.</i>
<i>She got third place.</i>

38:02.981 --> 38:05.016
<i>I mean, "All God's Creatures"‐‐</i>
<i>it was so emotional.</i>

38:05.016 --> 38:07.852
And Brynn just
smiled the whole time.

38:07.852 --> 38:09.220
Next, we have teen solos.

38:09.220 --> 38:10.922
We have five placements.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.827
Fifth place goes
out to number 62,

38:15.827 --> 38:17.395
"Collapsed Clavicle."

38:17.395 --> 38:19.097
MELISSA:
<i>Maddie always puts pressure</i>
<i>on herself to do well.</i>

38:19.097 --> 38:20.532
<i>Doesn't matter if she's</i>

38:20.532 --> 38:22.000
gonna be here till she's 18

38:22.000 --> 38:23.935
or if she has
one more competition.

38:23.935 --> 38:24.903
<i>She wants to win.</i>

38:24.903 --> 38:26.471
Fourth place...

38:28.139 --> 38:31.342
...entry number 97,
"The Entertainer."

38:34.879 --> 38:36.447
ASHLEE:
<i>Maddie got fourth?</i>

38:36.447 --> 38:37.816
<i>What?</i>

38:37.816 --> 38:39.818
The fact that Brynn got third
and Maddie got fourth,

38:39.818 --> 38:42.020
<i>just proves that Maddie</i>
<i>and Brynn are about</i>

38:42.020 --> 38:44.189
on the same level,
as far as dance ability.

38:44.189 --> 38:45.857
We have, uh,
small wonders group.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.559
Second place...

38:47.559 --> 38:48.993
KERRI:
<i>The girls have to win today,</i>

38:48.993 --> 38:52.330
because Abby will
acknowledge them as <i>the</i> team.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.833
<i>The mini team.</i>

38:54.833 --> 38:56.868
Entry number 95,
"When I Was."

38:56.868 --> 38:59.237
(applause)

38:59.237 --> 39:02.941
ANNOUNCER:
First place...

39:02.941 --> 39:04.909
Number 98,
"Just Like Mama Said."

39:04.909 --> 39:07.378
(crowd cheering)

39:07.378 --> 39:10.181
ELLIANA:
<i>It feels really cool to win,</i>

39:10.181 --> 39:11.749
<i>because I think I actually</i>

39:11.749 --> 39:13.418
proved myself to Miss Abby

39:13.418 --> 39:15.053
that I'm good enough
to be on the team.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.790
ANNOUNCER:
Next we have teen group.

39:18.790 --> 39:22.126
Fourth place‐‐ entry number 84,

39:22.126 --> 39:23.528
"The Moment."

39:23.528 --> 39:25.129
JILL:
<i>It's getting down to the end,</i>

39:25.129 --> 39:26.664
with Melissa and her kids.

39:26.664 --> 39:30.368
<i>We really need to win.</i>

39:30.368 --> 39:32.237
Third place...

39:35.640 --> 39:37.775
...entry number 99,
"The Atlantic."

39:41.045 --> 39:42.981
Wow.

39:42.981 --> 39:46.351
SARI: <i>So the minis are the only</i>
<i>ones that got first place.</i>

39:46.351 --> 39:48.753
Our minis definitely proved
themselves to Abby

39:48.753 --> 39:51.489
<i>and showed the elite moms that</i>

39:51.489 --> 39:52.423
we're here to stay.

39:52.423 --> 39:54.158
JILL:
Hi, pink ladies.

39:54.158 --> 39:56.527
KERRI:
The annoying minis are back,
don't worry.

39:56.527 --> 39:58.830
We never said "annoying."
They are annoying,
I'll say it now.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.665
SARI:
Why are we so annoying?

40:00.665 --> 40:02.533
You just are,
I'm sorry.

40:02.533 --> 40:03.902
Have you ever
looked in the mirror?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.303
Yeah, all day,
every day.

40:05.303 --> 40:06.404
Scary.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.605
What exactly is annoying?

40:07.605 --> 40:08.806
That we won first place.

40:08.806 --> 40:11.276
That‐that's
even more annoying.

40:11.276 --> 40:13.244
<i>Are you delusional?</i>

40:13.244 --> 40:15.613
We lost because Abby
spent more time

40:15.613 --> 40:17.181
<i>with the minis all week.</i>

40:17.181 --> 40:19.117
<i>I mean, come on, girls,</i>
<i>get over it.</i>

40:19.117 --> 40:21.152
<i>You're not as good</i>
<i>as you think you are.</i>

40:21.152 --> 40:23.621
KERRI: You guys are old news.
We're checked in.

40:23.621 --> 40:24.889
You guys have all checked out.

40:24.889 --> 40:27.292
You know what Abby called
you guys this morning?

40:27.292 --> 40:28.860
KIRA:
Yeah, what did she say?

40:28.860 --> 40:30.061
Uh, trash.
Oh, yeah.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.763
She said you guys are
trash; she did, yeah.

40:31.763 --> 40:32.897
Who did she call trash?
JESSALYNN: All of you.

40:36.501 --> 40:38.369
Hey, Abby, I heard you
called us all trash.

40:38.369 --> 40:41.606
Is that true?

40:41.606 --> 40:42.874
Yeah.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.809
All right...
I'm leaving.

40:44.809 --> 40:46.544
JILL: If that offends you
or threatens you,

40:46.544 --> 40:49.347
then maybe this isn't
the right team for you.

40:49.347 --> 40:50.682
It's not the right place,
because I don't need

40:50.682 --> 40:52.116
to be treated
like that by anybody.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.751
If you want
your daughter in this,

40:53.751 --> 40:56.387
you have to grow up
and deal with it.

40:56.387 --> 40:58.122
It's Abby.

40:58.122 --> 41:00.325
Since my daughter was four,
she's been insulting me.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.794
But guess what?
My kids are stars.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.929
If you want your kid
to be something,

41:04.929 --> 41:06.097
you have to stick it out.

41:06.097 --> 41:07.298
Why are you leaving?

41:07.298 --> 41:09.067
My daughters
are booked for jobs.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.468
That's why I'm leaving.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.037
Okay, when your daughters
get movies and jobs,

41:13.037 --> 41:14.138
you'll leave, too.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.874
Okay? And not be
on a competition team.

41:16.874 --> 41:18.676
Just sayin'.

41:18.676 --> 41:20.044
I thought I heard you say

41:20.044 --> 41:21.312
you were too good
for this, so...

41:21.312 --> 41:22.914
I'm never too good for anything.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.849
I'm too good for you.

41:24.849 --> 41:27.819
ABBY LEE:
<i>I think the mini moms are dumb,</i>

41:27.819 --> 41:30.355
and dumber and dumber
and dumber.

41:30.355 --> 41:33.858
I was gonna invite you back,
but now I don't know anymore.

41:33.858 --> 41:37.762
You don't need to be listening
to all these moms yelling.

41:37.762 --> 41:41.366
A teacher yelling,
so we're leaving.

41:41.366 --> 41:43.234
ABBY LEE:
<i>You were this close.</i>

41:43.234 --> 41:46.404
<i>An official team member,</i>
<i>and you blew it.</i>

41:46.404 --> 41:47.839
<i>That mother should say,</i>
<i>"Yes, ma'am.</i>

41:47.839 --> 41:49.640
<i>Thank you, ma'am."</i>

41:49.640 --> 41:52.176
And if you don't like it here,
your money is good elsewhere.

41:54.112 --> 41:55.413
ABBY LEE:
<i>Next on</i> Dance Moms...

41:55.413 --> 41:57.849
HOLLY: This is Maddie
and Mackenzie's last week.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.818
I don't think anybody
can fully replace us.

42:00.818 --> 42:03.087
ABBY LEE: So you think
that we should just all

42:03.087 --> 42:04.989
throw in the towel, 'cause
you're throwing in the towel?

42:04.989 --> 42:07.592
JILL: <i>It's Maddie and</i>
<i>Mackenzie's very last dance.</i>

42:07.592 --> 42:09.360
<i>And that's not</i>
<i>sitting well with Abby.</i>

42:09.360 --> 42:11.362
KERRI:
<i>Sari, you were talking about</i>

42:11.362 --> 42:12.697
<i>how excited your disabled son</i>

42:12.697 --> 42:14.665
<i>was to watch</i>
<i>your daughter dance.</i>

42:14.665 --> 42:17.201
And Melissa only worries
about her kids.

42:17.201 --> 42:20.071
Guess what.
Your kids will be nothing!

42:20.071 --> 42:24.876
I'm not really ready
for it to end.
