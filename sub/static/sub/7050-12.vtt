00:02.086 --> 00:03.419
Previously on Justified...

00:03.545 --> 00:04.587
Where's Ellen May?

00:04.797 --> 00:06.589
Let her go. Right now! Let her go!

00:08.425 --> 00:09.759
Limehouse!

00:10.177 --> 00:12.762
Whenever she'd get in trouble,
she'd threaten to go to Limehouse!

00:14.973 --> 00:17.475
See, Ava? I been hiding this whole time!

00:17.935 --> 00:19.644
And I ain't said nothing!

00:20.062 --> 00:21.187
Did Shelby drop you off?

00:21.271 --> 00:22.480
Shelby ain't left.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.190
$150,000.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.150
- For both of them?
- Each.

00:26.235 --> 00:28.444
Ellstin, we had a deal.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.072
We did. And now I'm changing it.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.366
Well, if you want Raylan Givens,
you'll need me.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.617
And if you want me...

00:34.910 --> 00:37.870
I'm still gonna need $500,000.

00:37.955 --> 00:41.374
How many
tweaker dick heads did you have to suck off

00:41.458 --> 00:43.835
before you got to
this wonderful place in your life?

00:44.128 --> 00:45.670
We don't give a shit about Boyd.

00:45.796 --> 00:49.674
That's not why we're here.
The man we're after, Drew Thompson.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.050
You can help us with that.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.177
The marshals got to Drew before Nicky could.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.679
How is that possible?

00:54.763 --> 00:57.098
I guess this is where
I'm supposed to surrender.

00:57.182 --> 01:00.727
You can tell us everything now
or let it be a big surprise later.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.312
You get me out of here,
I'll give you whatever you want.

01:07.192 --> 01:10.778
Talking about sending
me to Washington to meet the director.

01:11.488 --> 01:14.991
Most of the talk's all hearsay at this point,
but looking good.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.201
Hey, did you...

01:17.327 --> 01:19.287
- Did you sign that paperwork?
- That what?

01:19.371 --> 01:21.122
The forms I e-mailed you last week.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.082
No. I haven't.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.084
Okay, well,
you know they're to protect the baby

01:25.169 --> 01:27.170
in case something
happens to either one of us, so I'm just...

01:27.296 --> 01:28.463
I'm gonna need your signature.

01:28.547 --> 01:29.839
Okay, I will.

01:29.965 --> 01:32.008
It's kind of important
that you get it done before she's born.

01:32.134 --> 01:35.052
Yes. Listen, it is gonna be the first thing I do.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.306
- What did you just say?
- We're having a girl, Raylan.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.515
I found out this morning.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.018
A girl. Holy shit.

01:42.311 --> 01:43.352
Hold on.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.981
Thank you. I'm on the phone.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.193
Seriously.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.070
Winona...

01:53.864 --> 01:55.406
I don't know shit about girls.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.701
That is so sweet,
saying that like I don't already know.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.706
Look, let me call you back.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.876
It's great news.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.341
What's the matter with you, Raylan?
You not used to positive attention?

02:13.759 --> 02:16.010
Oh, no, I love that. Can we continue?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.386
No, the moment's gone.

02:17.513 --> 02:18.513
So sad.

02:18.597 --> 02:19.931
Congratulations, anyway.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.349
Thank you.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.100
Does this mean you're
finally getting a haircut?

02:23.227 --> 02:24.268
Don't hold your breath.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.562
Maybe you can
get one on all your forced time off.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.982
Congratulations. Nice work.
And you're suspended.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.692
Remind me why again.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.904
You want the whole list
or just, like, the good stuff that I underlined?

02:35.155 --> 02:36.572
What's going on in there?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.326
We're getting ready
to transfer Thompson to Con Air,

02:40.410 --> 02:41.744
take him to Supermax.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.037
And Theo Tonin?

02:43.664 --> 02:45.915
He's gone underground, but we'll get him.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.459
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse us for a moment.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.461
You want to change the terms of your deal,

02:50.546 --> 02:53.631
then why don't you talk to the people who
are gonna be most pissed off about it?

02:53.757 --> 02:55.216
My attorney should be here, shouldn't he?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.759
No, transport is top-secret.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.261
Not even your attorney can know about it.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.264
Okay, welcome to
Marshal Service Protection.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.476
There's a tremendous amount of resources
being expended to keep you alive.

03:05.561 --> 03:08.646
You're about to gum that up,
I'm liable to get my bowels in an uproar.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.649
It's not an unreasonable
request under the circumstances.

03:11.775 --> 03:14.402
We'll decide
what's reasonable and what isn't.

03:14.778 --> 03:15.820
What are we talking about here?

03:15.946 --> 03:19.282
We are talking about safety
and protection for a woman.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.033
Eve Munro's already
under Marshal protection.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.327
- We're not talking about Munro.
- No.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.581
She needs help. We talked about this.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.291
Let me be clear.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.502
You want a contingency rider on your deal,
here is our rebuttal.

03:31.587 --> 03:32.879
Stick it up your ass.

03:32.963 --> 03:37.049
You get nothing. No conditions, no perks,
no mercy whatsoever.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.885
Not till you hold up your end of the bargain.

03:38.969 --> 03:42.054
Give us a reason not to dangle you
behind a boat for the sharks to chew on.

03:42.139 --> 03:45.308
And I said
I'll do what I have to to keep her safe.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.476
No deal until she's in custody.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.853
Fine, go to prison.

03:49.313 --> 03:52.773
Sit in genpop
till Theo Tonin's boys fillet you like a perch.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.610
Sooner or later, you are gonna talk.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.279
And you will do so
absent any guarantees for her

03:58.363 --> 04:00.573
or any other bullshit you can dream up.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.743
And just so we're on the same page,
what woman are we talking about?

04:13.045 --> 04:14.086
Is it time?

04:15.047 --> 04:16.088
Time for what?

04:16.839 --> 04:19.257
For Boyd and Ava to kill me.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.269
Now, didn't I tell you
I wasn't gonna let that happen?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.981
You told me
you were gonna take their money

04:34.399 --> 04:35.983
and you were gonna let me go.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.488
And do you not think I'm a man of my word?

04:42.240 --> 04:44.075
I don't know what to believe.

04:44.660 --> 04:46.327
Now, haven't I kept you safe this far?

04:48.705 --> 04:49.789
What?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.751
I don't got no choice in the matter anyways.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.171
You take their money
and you let them kill me,

04:57.255 --> 04:59.590
or you take their money and you let me go.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.843
Either way, I think I'll probably wind up dead.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.595
So, you just go ahead

05:05.180 --> 05:08.182
and do whatever it is that you got to do.

05:08.892 --> 05:12.103
And I will just sit here
and wait for it to happen

05:13.021 --> 05:14.897
like I been doing all along.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.365
I say we find that
turncoat sack of shit and kill him.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.492
His truck's set outside his bar.
We can get him right now.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.452
I don't want to talk about Johnny.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.830
Ellen May up in Nobles.
I mean, we just go grab her, right?

05:30.914 --> 05:32.289
I mean, she's just sitting up there.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.708
She is the priority, isn't she?

05:33.959 --> 05:36.877
Tonin is gonna send people for you
if he hasn't already.

05:36.962 --> 05:39.255
That's the point.
That's who Johnny's working for, Boyd.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.382
We got to take him out
before he gives them too much on us.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.385
We could hit Nobles come nighttime,
hit them hard, hit them fast.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.137
We're in and out with her
before they ever caught on.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.556
Man, you have no idea what the
hell you're even talking about.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.307
They got, like,
50 guys out there guarding that place.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.475
We seen them.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.395
So, why don't we just lie low and see
what Nicky Augustine's gonna do?

05:54.646 --> 05:55.896
'Cause Ellen May ain't going nowhere.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.732
No, that's exactly what Johnny wants.
We can't wait.

05:57.816 --> 05:58.899
- Quiet.
- But he's right.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.526
- We're running out of time.
- Quiet!

06:02.779 --> 06:04.530
Look, I appreciate your
passionate points of view,

06:04.614 --> 06:08.492
but I would like to have a moment
alone with my fiancÃ©.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.796
"Nothing brings you peace

06:21.548 --> 06:23.883
"but the triumph of principles."

06:24.509 --> 06:26.844
Ralph Waldo Emerson said that.

06:27.512 --> 06:31.682
I keep thinking about
what's most important in this moment.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.852
And with everything

06:36.146 --> 06:38.564
twirling, and I...

06:40.358 --> 06:42.068
I keep coming back to you...

06:43.612 --> 06:45.154
To your safety,

06:45.989 --> 06:47.531
to your freedom.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.117
But if you're saying
that we go after Ellen May,

06:50.202 --> 06:51.786
we ain't even got the money to do it.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.579
I'm saying that we go after Limehouse.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.833
Now, if we want Ellen May back,
we gonna have to take her.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.251
I disagree.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.088
A man who speaks out of
both sides of his mouth

07:02.631 --> 07:04.924
deserves to have it permanently shut.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.425
Who said that?

07:06.510 --> 07:07.968
Boyd Crowder.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.967
Drew Thompson
and the hooker with the heart of gold...

07:48.051 --> 07:50.469
It's a very nice story
he'll be able to tell his cell mate

07:50.554 --> 07:52.513
before Tonin's crew kills him.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.641
What do you think it is
with him and that Audrey's whore?

07:55.725 --> 07:57.143
Does he think she's Julia Roberts

07:57.227 --> 08:00.187
and he's old
what's-his-name with the white limo?

08:00.272 --> 08:02.064
She ain't no Julia Roberts.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.150
You know,
I never cared for her much, anyway.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.651
Looked too much like Eric.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.070
- Great smile.
- Great legs.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.781
Maybe this is
just him trying to take a parting shot at Boyd.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.366
Well, whatever. We got him.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.910
That's the important thing.
Rest of it's just gravy.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.037
I'll go get her.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.124
- Get who?
- The whore, Ellen May.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.210
- No, the hell you will. You're suspended.
- Suspend me tomorrow.

08:23.295 --> 08:24.837
That's not how it works, Raylan.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.422
Suspend me right around
the baby's due date.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.966
Tack on a couple days.
I ain't fighting the suspension.

08:29.092 --> 08:32.010
You know, suspendees don't get to
choose when they get suspended.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.345
That would be called a vacation.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.056
I drive down to Harlan,
find the girl, I bring her back,

08:36.140 --> 08:39.643
I set her in front of this asshole,
and I say, "Here, asshole."

08:39.769 --> 08:42.688
He talks. We let her go.
It's happiness all around.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.358
Fine, I'll send Tim and Rachel to do that,
and you take a few days off, Charlie Hustle.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.987
No, let me do this. Don't take away
the one thing I know how to do.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.156
What the hell's wrong with you, Raylan?

08:52.449 --> 08:55.576
Don't you know how to win?
Can't you enjoy anything?

08:55.660 --> 08:58.454
You got a family on the way.
Have you even talked to Winona recently?

08:58.580 --> 09:01.207
I just talked to her, actually. I'm having a girl.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.042
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.378
Don't you think that's even more of a reason
to spend a little time at home?

09:06.463 --> 09:07.963
Art, it's one detail.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.884
Fine, I'll take Rachel and Tim.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.385
- I'll take them both.
- That's big of you.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.721
Let me do this. Let me finish what I started.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.184
What are we?

09:20.727 --> 09:22.186
Gunning up?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.857
Running never solves problems, Johnny.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.068
It's just my two cents.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.362
Only thing gonna solve my problems is this.

09:31.446 --> 09:35.532
So, thank you,
but excuse me if I'm preoccupied.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.954
You're the one who decided to bite the hand.
Accept responsibility for your choices.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.331
The whole idea was
you were supposed to get Drew.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.457
Now, you made assurances.

09:43.541 --> 09:46.085
- Now, if you had followed through with that...
- If, if, if...

09:46.169 --> 09:48.545
Why are we trafficking in might-have-beens?

09:48.964 --> 09:50.756
The question is,
you want to keep helping or not?

09:51.716 --> 09:54.969
Helping you how?
Digging graves for your crew?

09:55.804 --> 09:57.388
It's true.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.724
I've lost some ballast.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.560
But I still got Picker here, right?

10:04.396 --> 10:07.940
As for you, there might still be a way
for us to work this out.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.609
- How?
- Good.

10:11.027 --> 10:14.571
Sceptical but eager.
It's already better than running.

10:15.991 --> 10:19.285
Your uncle Theo has ears everywhere.
Literally.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.661
Lately, there's been some noise

10:20.745 --> 10:23.455
that Drew Thompson
was gumming up the works of his deal

10:23.790 --> 10:26.542
over some
trailer-park bunk bunny he wants protected.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.211
Has some tragic,
southern name I've forgotten.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.381
Ellen May.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.178
Hello.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.181
- Mr Limehouse.
- Busy.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.058
Johnny Crowder.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.782
Last we spoke,
you was none too pleased with me.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.244
As I recall, you even threatened my person.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.788
Well, things have changed
since then, Mr Limehouse.

11:05.123 --> 11:08.083
And I hope that,

11:08.501 --> 11:11.045
given the notion
that I am taking over Boyd's enterprise,

11:11.129 --> 11:13.047
that we can bury that hatchet now.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.549
I hadn't heard
that Boyd was going out of business

11:15.633 --> 11:17.134
such that you could take it over.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.929
Or did he cede you the works on his own?

11:21.389 --> 11:23.932
That doesn't matter.
I am calling you about our whore.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.186
I was told the asking price is $300,000.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.314
Well, if I knew what you was talking about...
And I don't.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.524
Where would
you get that kind of money, Mr Crowder?

11:32.984 --> 11:35.027
I told you, things have changed.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.321
I've got partners now.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.490
And just who might these partners be,

11:40.408 --> 11:43.744
fools from Detroit
that Boyd's got the wrong side of?

11:43.828 --> 11:45.913
Was you thinking
you could fare better than him?

11:45.997 --> 11:48.999
All you need to concern yourself with is,
do I have the cash?

11:49.334 --> 11:51.293
- Do you?
- Well, do you have Ellen May?

11:51.669 --> 11:53.045
I don't know who that is.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.006
Now, what makes you think
I'm gonna have any dealings with you?

11:56.091 --> 11:58.133
Well, I can think of about 300,000 reasons.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.887
Yeah, well, you remember what happened
last time Detroit came to Noble.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.766
A man lost his arm,
and the Marshals took my money.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.434
Well, that ain't gonna happen this time.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.687
No, it is not. I'm gonna tell you
what's gonna happen this time.

12:10.772 --> 12:11.939
Nothing.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.273
Now, Limehouse, wait.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.401
No. Goodbye, Johnny Crowder.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.152
Don't you ever call here again.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.871
Wow. That sounded fantastic.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.458
Should we pop the champagne now
or wait till after we got her?

12:31.543 --> 12:33.127
- Something's not right.
- I'd have to agree.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.712
What kind of man doesn't want $300,000?

12:39.175 --> 12:41.218
The kind of man that already made that deal.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.387
With my cousin.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.517
Now, there's a bootlegger's road
that runs along the back of Nobles Holler.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.144
They'll have
people positioned all along that ridge,

12:50.228 --> 12:52.855
so we back-country in parallel to the road.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.273
That's how we get past them.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.734
And I say we take two cars
in case we get in trouble.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.448
We go in as soon as the sun goes down.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.534
And once you're up there,
what's the plan then?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.995
I'm gonna stick a gun in Limehouse's mouth,

13:08.079 --> 13:11.165
tell him we have Emulex tucked
underneath three houses in his holler,

13:11.249 --> 13:12.916
I just can't remember which one.

13:13.084 --> 13:16.628
And he doesn't give us Ellen May,
I'm gonna have Jimmy here push a button.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.882
Come Thanksgiving,
he can serve all the dark meat he wants.

13:28.308 --> 13:32.478
Well, cousin Johnny,
you got some balls calling me.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.938
It's not your cousin. It's Nicky Augustine.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.773
Well, Mr Augustine,

13:37.942 --> 13:41.028
after the way you spoke to my woman,
I'll say the same thing to you.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.363
You got some balls calling me.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.449
It's not balls, Mr Crowder. It's bad manners.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.409
I apologise. I got carried away.

13:47.869 --> 13:50.537
I must say I'm a big admirer of your work,

13:50.622 --> 13:52.789
and I want you to know
that I tender this call with respect.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.376
And I hope that
we can find a way to do business together.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.587
Why would I do that?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.631
Call it mutual beneficence.

14:01.132 --> 14:04.176
Well, "mutual" implies we both
get something out of this arrangement.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.429
I have yet to hear
what's in it for me and mine.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.265
How about
I get you the money to get Ellen May?

14:11.643 --> 14:13.477
And give you your cousin Johnny?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.028
That's what I call a sweet deal.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.248
And why would you want
to legislate gun control?

14:35.333 --> 14:36.959
Come on, boys. Put those things away.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.044
Let's start this off on a good foot.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.088
Soon as I see your boys go first.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.549
Mr Picker, need I remind you

14:43.633 --> 14:47.386
that you extended the invitation to us,
not the other way around?

14:47.470 --> 14:48.845
Of course we did.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.932
Nobody's shooting anybody today.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.393
It's "everybody wins" day
here at Johnny's bar.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.562
Everybody except Johnny.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.105
Well, Mr Augustine,

14:59.691 --> 15:01.108
while you apologised to me,

15:01.192 --> 15:04.528
I think the offended party
is standing right there.

15:07.865 --> 15:12.202
I offer you my deepest apologies
for my discourtesy.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.912
It's no excuse, but, you know,

15:13.997 --> 15:16.790
when I find myself sometimes in a bar
like this, I'm not my best self.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.476
Mr Augustine,

15:36.561 --> 15:39.396
seeing as how Drew Thompson's
already in the Marshals' custody,

15:39.939 --> 15:43.442
why you're cutting off
the tail of my cousin and offering him up

15:43.735 --> 15:45.319
is opaque to me.

15:45.403 --> 15:46.987
I'm gonna need
Google Translate on my phone

15:47.071 --> 15:48.238
if I'm gonna keep talking to you.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.240
What do you want?

15:50.533 --> 15:53.368
Whore squirreled away
up there in the black holler.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.620
This is the money to buy her.

15:55.079 --> 15:58.582
I see. Well, since you already know my deal,

15:59.375 --> 16:00.834
you got your money,

16:00.918 --> 16:04.463
you got this duplicitous
piece of shit working for you.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.673
What do you need me for?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.175
Because this duplicitous piece of shit

16:08.259 --> 16:09.968
couldn't get us to
the man who has the whore.

16:10.053 --> 16:13.013
So you help us get the whore,
we give lemon head the money,

16:13.097 --> 16:14.556
you get the duplicitous piece of shit.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.602
And why may I ask do you want Ellen May?

16:19.729 --> 16:22.022
Shelby won't testify unless she's safe.
They want to leverage her...

16:22.106 --> 16:23.940
- Oh, God!
- No talking.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.443
Why, cousin Johnny,
you hadn't even had a chance

16:26.527 --> 16:27.986
to enjoy the fruits of your betrayal.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.740
I have one more question for you.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.869
What do you plan on doing with Ellen May
once she serves her purpose?

16:35.953 --> 16:37.287
We're gonna take her to Six Flags.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.750
All right, so, I say we take two cars.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.503
No. I'll go.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.714
I was thinking
this be more of a group excursion.

16:47.799 --> 16:51.009
We can't just roll up to his
door like a Jehovah's Witness.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.887
Limehouse don't like white people,
and he hates you.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.681
Now, I'm the exception.

16:55.973 --> 17:01.269
So, the only way this works
is if I go up there and I make this deal alone.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.897
I don't have a problem with it, Mr Augustine.
Do you?

17:03.981 --> 17:06.148
As long as you stay here with me,
I don't care who goes.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.651
All I want is the whore.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.993
Well, what are we drinking?

17:34.721 --> 17:38.598
- What the hell y'all want now?
- Come on, Ellstin. We don't rate a hello?

17:38.683 --> 17:42.728
US Marshal darken my door,
I got to consider what it is I'm about to lose.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.980
Well, maybe we just came up
for a little pulled pork.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.690
Yeah, well, this one over here maybe,

17:47.316 --> 17:50.026
but you crackers
wouldn't know pulled pork from pig bung.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.237
How you been, little sister?

17:52.697 --> 17:55.323
You calling me little sister
like you putting me in my place.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.616
Well...

17:57.285 --> 17:58.869
What else am I supposed to call you?

17:58.953 --> 18:00.787
You got your gun on all big and bad.

18:00.872 --> 18:04.374
All I see is a little old Aunt Jemima
taking orders from the Man.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.127
You want to find out,
if you insult me enough,

18:07.211 --> 18:09.546
I'm gonna break rank
and put you into your place?

18:10.006 --> 18:11.923
Keep talking shit, and we'll see.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.013
Well, I don't want you here.
I don't want none of y'all here.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.140
Your presence gives me the fidgets.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.810
People up here all day talking about,
"Where this one is, where that one is."

18:23.895 --> 18:25.228
I'm starting to lose patience over it.

18:25.563 --> 18:26.730
Yeah? Like who?

18:27.356 --> 18:29.274
Like none of your damn business who.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.985
Ellstin, easy enough to get rid of us.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.571
Just give us what we want,
never see us again.

18:34.864 --> 18:39.576
- Am I supposed to intuit what that might be?
- Runaway named Ellen May.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.204
- Is she a fugitive?
- Not exactly.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.998
Then why y'all looking for her?
What makes you think she up here?

18:45.082 --> 18:47.083
It was reported to us that she was.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.502
Who in the hell is this?

18:48.586 --> 18:49.711
He's gonna back me up

18:49.796 --> 18:52.589
I got to put my boot
up your ass out here in front of everybody.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.257
Sexy.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.011
Little sister barking loud now.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.180
You think she got any bite?

19:00.264 --> 19:04.392
Ellstin, we asking you
is she here out of courtesy.

19:04.769 --> 19:08.230
We were told this was her last known
location. Reportedly against her will.

19:08.314 --> 19:13.026
We believe she's here or she was.
And we aim to find out. You understand?

19:13.611 --> 19:17.113
Well, if she was here or ever was,
she ain't now.

19:17.949 --> 19:22.202
But y'all can search
this whole 100-odd acres of this entire holler

19:22.286 --> 19:23.954
and prove it to yourself.

19:28.209 --> 19:31.253
So, we are literally
searching every outhouse,

19:31.337 --> 19:34.381
dog house, hen house,
just on the off chance she's here?

19:34.465 --> 19:37.342
We'll let the staties do it.
They live for this shit.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.594
They'll be up here with dogs and all
within a half an hour.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.930
Yeah, meaning
we're rolling around in a larger footprint

19:42.014 --> 19:44.349
all for some girl we don't need.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.643
I told the guy I was gonna toss the joint.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.895
Can't just be an idle threat
or I'll look like a pussy.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.814
Plus, he was rude to Rachel.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.108
Well, okay.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.694
Well, maybe we can
get a little barbecue for the wait.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.571
Maybe you can. I'm gonna go to Harlan.

19:57.655 --> 20:01.157
Hold on, Captain America.
We're out here covering your suspension.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.367
So, come with me.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.911
Tim can stay here,
watch the road till the staties land.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.080
How is it that I'm the one standing roadside

20:07.164 --> 20:09.374
while you all
traipse off on some Harlan county safari?

20:09.458 --> 20:11.126
'Cause you'll keep a level head.

20:11.586 --> 20:13.628
She's out of control. You saw her back there.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.631
Come on. This is what we do.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.176
Did you not wake up this morning thinking
today was another opportunity

20:20.261 --> 20:22.345
to mess up some bad guy's day?

20:23.180 --> 20:24.514
I did.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.560
So, what's in Harlan?

20:28.644 --> 20:31.187
Limehouse said
folks have been up here looking all day.

20:31.272 --> 20:34.649
I can only assume that means about
Ellen May, which means Boyd.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.276
We'll stay in touch.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.694
I'll be right here.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.875
Good thing
he brought you up the back way, miss Ava.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.836
But I can't say I'm fond of all these visitors.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.796
Think I'm any happier than you are?

20:56.881 --> 20:59.758
Well, no matter what your feelings about it,

21:00.176 --> 21:03.929
we getting ready to have us
a US Marshal search party any minute.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.473
Well, I should be gone
by the time they get here

21:07.183 --> 21:09.142
if we get our business done.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.644
What's that?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.105
Well, well.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.441
Now that I got your attention...

21:18.235 --> 21:20.236
You know, I need you to know that

21:20.321 --> 21:23.323
I don't appreciate the way you
changed the deal on me and Boyd.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.868
I wasn't born yesterday.
I didn't expect you to play it straight.

21:26.953 --> 21:30.747
But the way you conduct business
makes me wonder if you got any friends.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.916
And you want me to what, apologise?

21:33.334 --> 21:36.920
I want you to take this money
and give me Ellen May.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.756
What you saying about our dealings,

21:40.174 --> 21:41.424
I understand what you mean.

21:41.759 --> 21:46.638
I've been wondering lately
what it is makes us forget who we are.

21:47.723 --> 21:51.851
I got in this whole mess here
on account of what I thought Nobles needed.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.646
Wrong people, wrong reasons.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.106
Damn near lost everything.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.485
Having to sell off parcels of land
just to keep Nobles alive...

22:00.569 --> 22:03.321
Land we have owned since Emancipation.

22:03.990 --> 22:09.285
Well, I see this money as a good start
along the road to Nobles' return to glory.

22:09.996 --> 22:13.790
I look at you, Ava, and I see
somebody I hardly even know any more.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.710
I can't do this.

22:17.211 --> 22:18.837
And you shouldn't, either.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.047
Besides, that girl is gone.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.632
What do you mean, gone?

22:22.842 --> 22:24.592
I just mean gone.

22:25.928 --> 22:26.970
You let her go?

22:28.180 --> 22:30.557
- Where?
- I don't know.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.393
God damn it, Limehouse.

22:34.145 --> 22:36.563
Ava, Ava, Ava. Come on, now.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.816
All these things you've done,

22:40.317 --> 22:44.821
with no mind
for the consequences to other people,

22:45.698 --> 22:48.742
are you gonna have peace of mind
when this is all over?

22:57.084 --> 23:00.170
She's not at Nobles. Limehouse let her go.

23:00.504 --> 23:03.590
I presented him the money,
he wouldn't take it. She's gone, baby.

23:03.674 --> 23:07.844
Marshals about to search the place.
I'm guessing he's telling the truth.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.138
Maybe she went back to see Nicky Cush.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.474
Maybe she's gone to see that Cassie woman.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.601
Maybe she just lit out. I don't know.

23:14.685 --> 23:17.771
Ellen May hadn't got the means
or the imagination to take off on her own.

23:18.355 --> 23:19.481
I'll check the church.

23:19.565 --> 23:23.234
I'll have Colt meet you there.
And we'll check out Cush's.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.111
You can't be here.

23:25.196 --> 23:28.114
Look, you always said
I was your favourite, okay?

23:28.199 --> 23:30.992
And when I didn't have no place to go,
you got me up off the streets

23:31.077 --> 23:33.620
and into one of them trailers,
and I'm grateful, okay?

23:33.704 --> 23:36.664
And now all's I need is one more favour.

23:37.041 --> 23:41.169
No, no, no. If Boyd finds out you was here
and I helped you, he gonna kill me.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.254
You didn't see him. The look in his eyes.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.964
There's blackness behind them.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.050
Well, how about if you
just give me your keys,

23:47.134 --> 23:49.677
and he comes by,
you can just tell him I stole it.

23:49.804 --> 23:51.971
No, no. He won't believe me.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.140
Well, then maybe you
ought to drive me after all,

23:54.225 --> 23:56.768
- you know, hide out for a while.
- Hide out?

23:58.562 --> 24:00.188
This is my hideout.

24:01.899 --> 24:03.233
Please.

24:05.736 --> 24:07.237
- All right.
- Thank you.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.740
I'm off my mind. This isn't gonna happen.

24:13.244 --> 24:14.369
- All right.
- Okay.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.204
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What now?

24:16.497 --> 24:19.415
Listen. Hear that? You know what that is?

24:19.834 --> 24:22.669
- I don't hear anything.
- Exactly.

24:22.920 --> 24:26.589
- They fly drones now.
- Nick, come on.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.636
- Shit.
- What? Is it the drones?

24:32.847 --> 24:37.559
No, no. No, no, it's not drones.

24:40.104 --> 24:44.899
All right, just a warning.
This fella's a little touched.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.025
Well, should I be scared?

24:46.110 --> 24:48.194
Well, not if you're secure
in your political views.

24:48.279 --> 24:49.946
You take the back.

25:04.128 --> 25:05.795
- Jesus.
- See what I mean?

25:08.132 --> 25:10.300
Yeah, this is like a desperate cry for help.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.886
Well, we all have our eccentricities.

25:12.970 --> 25:14.804
Yeah, they don't all need to be medicated.

25:16.098 --> 25:18.725
Probably scared him off.
He's probably long gone by now.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.727
That drill bit was probably a little much.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.104
Yo. Shower.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.705
I got you now, assholes!

25:46.212 --> 25:49.297
Hello, Boyd. Who's got the drill now?

25:49.381 --> 25:52.592
Now, you, two fingers,
hold your gun out and put it on the ground.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.260
You know,
I remember reading this article one time...

25:54.345 --> 25:55.386
All right, now kick it over!

25:55.471 --> 25:56.930
...about the bank robbers out in California.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.265
Do you remember the ones?
They had body armour on, too.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.017
- Okay, now you.
- I'm just the driver.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.353
Bullshit! Don't make me shoot.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.607
Yeah, I read that article.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the...

26:07.691 --> 26:09.734
The north Hollywood boys. Now, them boys,

26:09.818 --> 26:12.111
- they knew how to take on the Feds, all right.
- Yeah.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.405
I ain't falling for it, Boyd! Drop the gun!

26:14.490 --> 26:15.782
Put it down now! I swear to God!

26:15.866 --> 26:18.159
Cops had a hard time
bringing them boys down.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.078
Do you remember what
their only weakness was?

26:20.162 --> 26:22.872
Yeah, I remember what their weakness was.
They ran out of bullets.

26:28.212 --> 26:29.712
My foot!

26:32.675 --> 26:35.551
They didn't armour their feet, asshole.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.971
Now take that mask off, you dumbass.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.224
Where is she?

26:42.893 --> 26:43.977
Bar's closed.

26:44.061 --> 26:47.230
Surely you're not brandishing a weapon
at two deputy US Marshals,

26:47.314 --> 26:49.899
putting yourself at risk for arrest,
imprisonment, or worse.

26:49.984 --> 26:51.651
- I'm just protecting the bar.
- From what?

26:51.735 --> 26:53.569
From wild Apaches. What do you care?

26:55.447 --> 26:56.489
Rachel...

26:57.908 --> 26:59.784
US Marshals. Guns on the floor.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.583
Don't do that.

27:07.668 --> 27:10.670
Don't even think about that.
That ain't gonna end well for you.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.636
Say, Johnny, you seen better days.

27:18.721 --> 27:21.514
Yeah. Ever since I helped out
you and your little friend here,

27:21.598 --> 27:22.974
I've been shitting rainbows.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.142
You helped them with what?

27:24.226 --> 27:27.020
What did you expect, Johnny,
a job cutting my lawn?

27:27.646 --> 27:28.771
Say, where's Ellen May?

27:29.273 --> 27:32.358
Everyone's out looking for her.
Even Boyd's out with the Detroit boys now.

27:32.443 --> 27:35.528
I didn't ask who was looking for her.
I asked where she was.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.113
Do you know?

27:38.198 --> 27:39.407
Do you?

27:40.200 --> 27:41.659
Bet their boss does.

27:42.244 --> 27:45.455
Probably got something to do with Shelby,
what with Johnny trussed in a chair here.

27:45.539 --> 27:46.998
Why don't you get Boyd
on the phone for me?

27:47.082 --> 27:48.374
Why don't you kiss my dimpled ass?

27:49.793 --> 27:52.962
I don't see how that invitation has
anything to do with my request.

27:54.131 --> 27:57.258
- Why you got to be such a dick?
- My job, being a dick.

27:57.885 --> 27:59.344
It'd be weird if you liked me.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.763
Now, you were about to make a phone call.

28:11.482 --> 28:14.150
Say, look at that. He saved you the trouble.

28:14.985 --> 28:17.195
I'm gonna put it on speaker.
You're gonna play along.

28:20.324 --> 28:21.407
Hello.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.618
- Hey.
- Listen to me.

28:23.911 --> 28:26.245
I need you to take Nicky's men
to the church where Cassie is.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.580
Ellen May should be there.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.665
Good plan. Small problem.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.001
- Raylan?
- Boyd, I'm sorry. They came...

28:33.587 --> 28:34.754
Boyd,

28:34.838 --> 28:38.674
want to send a message to you
and the boys you're working for from Detroit.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.343
It's a simple one, really.

28:40.886 --> 28:44.013
You lost. Give up. Go home.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.891
- Was that the Marshal in the hat?
- It was.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.102
- What was his name?
- Raylan Givens. We got to go.

28:49.686 --> 28:52.563
- Hey, Raylan, what about me?
- What about you?

28:52.648 --> 28:54.899
- They'll get me even in jail.
- You count on it.

28:56.193 --> 28:57.777
I helped you get Drew.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.196
I don't know. It's up to her.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.906
I'm late for church.

29:03.117 --> 29:06.577
Ever since this all started,
I've been praying and praying,

29:07.037 --> 29:09.664
"Jesus, please help me
find a way out of this."

29:10.582 --> 29:15.837
I swore up and down I'd change my ways
and I'd do anything He wanted.

29:16.713 --> 29:21.759
Even knowing I wasn't worthy, I still prayed,
'cause you told me He listened.

29:21.844 --> 29:23.553
And He does, Ellen May.

29:24.388 --> 29:25.888
Then I was up at Nobles,

29:26.306 --> 29:29.016
stuck in that room, waiting to die again,

29:29.101 --> 29:32.979
praying, "God, get me out of this."

29:34.314 --> 29:35.690
And then,

29:36.692 --> 29:38.276
just like that,

29:39.111 --> 29:40.820
Mr Limehouse let me go.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.032
And I knew... I knew...

29:45.576 --> 29:48.953
I knew God had worked a miracle in his heart

29:50.330 --> 29:52.623
and that, even after everything I had done,

29:53.167 --> 29:55.251
I was still worthy of His love.

30:00.007 --> 30:03.926
I told you I done things... Horrible things.

30:04.428 --> 30:09.515
But I never told you how I sunk a man,
was shot right in front of me,

30:10.267 --> 30:12.810
down a splinter shaft off Black Lick Road.

30:13.353 --> 30:17.732
He'd been shot in half,
clear in half, with a shotgun.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.111
I helped carry his body out,

30:23.363 --> 30:25.281
and I covered up who done it.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.285
All this time,

30:30.579 --> 30:32.914
I been keeping that inside,

30:32.998 --> 30:35.541
and it's been eating away at me, you know?

30:36.293 --> 30:38.711
I think God let me out of that room

30:39.880 --> 30:43.966
for me to come and tell you this thing

30:45.928 --> 30:47.887
so I could be washed in His blood.

30:49.264 --> 30:52.558
In Jesus' blood, I mean,
not the man I was party to killing.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.895
What man we talking about here, Ellen May?

30:59.399 --> 31:02.944
You think telling this girl what you done,
that cleans your slate,

31:03.820 --> 31:05.696
purifies your mortal soul?

31:06.657 --> 31:08.699
Well, it don't. Not by a long shot.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.034
I don't believe that, Ava.

31:11.328 --> 31:13.788
I don't believe a word
comes out of your mouth.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.540
I know what I know.

31:15.624 --> 31:18.251
- And what's that?
- That if God can forgive me,

31:20.003 --> 31:21.254
I can forgive you, too.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.339
I don't need your forgiveness, Ellen May.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.883
And I don't talk to God.

31:25.968 --> 31:27.969
There's peace in repentance, Ava.

31:28.679 --> 31:30.680
It's unlike anything you ever felt.

31:31.265 --> 31:32.974
Always found peace

31:33.517 --> 31:35.810
comes from doing
what your heart tells you is right.

31:36.186 --> 31:38.479
And we ain't got control over the rest.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.857
'Cause it wasn't God that let you
out of that room up in Nobles

31:42.359 --> 31:45.361
or pulled you out of Colt's car
or put this gun in my hand.

31:45.445 --> 31:48.447
That was people making choices
all down the line, Ellen May.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.366
What choice you making?

31:51.660 --> 31:53.244
You kill her, you got to kill me, too.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.288
You willing to have
two murders on your head?

31:55.372 --> 31:58.207
You got no idea
what I'm willing to do, little girl.

32:01.169 --> 32:04.505
Hey, Ava. What's going on here?

32:06.216 --> 32:08.718
Ava's just about to finish what you started.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.095
Is this what Boyd wants?

32:15.350 --> 32:16.767
I don't know.

32:17.394 --> 32:18.728
Well,

32:21.064 --> 32:22.315
what are you gonna do, Ava?

32:37.205 --> 32:39.582
Baby, before you say anything,
I'm on my way.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.709
I can't do it.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.712
I'm standing right here,
and I know what I got to do,

32:44.796 --> 32:45.880
but I can't.

32:47.257 --> 32:48.841
I'm so sorry, Boyd.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.885
It's just not who I am.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.012
Ava, you do what you got to do.

33:12.282 --> 33:13.658
Hey.

33:21.541 --> 33:22.667
Colt, no.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.544
Stop right where you are.

33:25.962 --> 33:28.506
Drop the weapon. Move away. Move away.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.132
Goddamn.

33:32.469 --> 33:35.012
I just cannot catch a break.

33:43.814 --> 33:45.022
Drop it on the ground.

33:45.107 --> 33:46.524
Maybe in a minute.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.484
- Don't.
- Relax.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.160
Gonna quit tomorrow.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.334
What do you think you're doing?

34:07.838 --> 34:09.255
I'm smoking.

34:14.094 --> 34:15.928
Did you kill my friend?

34:16.012 --> 34:18.179
You know what it's like to be in the shit.

34:18.889 --> 34:21.183
Go back there enough times,
and bad things happen.

34:21.351 --> 34:23.185
So, you did kill him?

34:23.687 --> 34:25.312
Collateral damage.

34:32.696 --> 34:35.197
I'm sorry about
what happened to your friend Mark,

34:35.574 --> 34:37.992
but I think most of him
died somewhere in Kandahar.

34:38.284 --> 34:40.953
Only part I'm concerned about
is the one that died here.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.913
Last time I'm telling you.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.206
Put your weapon on the ground.

35:02.309 --> 35:03.517
I guess I'll quit today.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.106
Colton?

35:51.733 --> 35:53.400
Anybody else hurt?

35:54.945 --> 35:56.153
Ellen May.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.116
You got a full dance card here
in the next little bit.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.744
- Is Shelby all right?
- Shelby's in custody.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.914
Do you think maybe I could see him?

36:07.249 --> 36:10.584
I think you had us jump through about
all the hoops we're willing to.

36:11.336 --> 36:12.962
But if you're civil and easy to get along with,

36:13.088 --> 36:17.591
I'll let you roll the window down
on the way back to Lexington.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.639
He's still looking out for you,
else none of us would be here.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.769
- You involved in a shooting?
- Nope.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.829
How you doing?

36:50.667 --> 36:51.876
That good?

36:53.003 --> 36:54.670
What are you gonna do now?

36:56.965 --> 37:00.509
I don't know. I mean,
this was my brother's church, you know?

37:01.636 --> 37:05.347
He was a true believer.
I just went along and helped keep it afloat.

37:07.309 --> 37:09.018
His heart was the pure one.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.146
Mine's not so pure.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.360
God forgive me, but I've been

37:19.029 --> 37:21.030
praying and praying

37:22.782 --> 37:25.326
that it'd be Boyd Crowder
that your bullet found.

37:34.544 --> 37:36.879
I'm sorry about your friend.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.554
I understand, Ava,

37:47.182 --> 37:49.850
why you needed to do it
the way that you did it.

37:52.228 --> 37:53.729
I respect it

37:54.898 --> 37:56.357
on every level.

38:00.153 --> 38:02.154
Turned it all around now, I guess.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.575
It was just our fate.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.827
I don't believe in fate.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.538
I can't believe in fate, not any more.

38:15.001 --> 38:19.546
I believe you dictate
the river of fate through your own actions.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.716
There's still one more move we can make,

38:23.927 --> 38:26.428
something we should have done
a long time ago.

38:28.056 --> 38:31.725
And we get rid of Delroy's body
once and for all.

38:39.401 --> 38:40.734
Do you believe in me?

38:42.237 --> 38:43.445
Yes.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.791
- Hey, when is he...
- He's coming.

38:56.626 --> 38:57.918
Relax.

39:15.603 --> 39:18.022
It's all right, John. I got it.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.875
It's a hell of a nice chair,
if you don't mind me saying so.

39:37.959 --> 39:39.877
And you don't
have anything that says who it's from?

39:39.961 --> 39:41.378
No, ma'am, I surely don't.

39:41.463 --> 39:43.130
I can have the office run it down
and call you tomorrow.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.549
That's all right. I got a pretty good idea.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.384
My wife, when she had her first baby,

39:47.469 --> 39:50.387
I remember this gliding chair
being a lot easier on her back.

39:50.472 --> 39:54.391
Well, I am not altogether sure
that my ex-husband knows

39:54.476 --> 39:56.810
what is and what is not good for my back.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.979
Here. It looks good.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.731
It does. Now, I got to sign anything or...

40:00.815 --> 40:02.066
No, ma'am. You're fine.

40:05.570 --> 40:08.155
- So, boy or girl?
- It's a little girl.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.075
Congratulations, ma'am.
You have yourself a lovely day, okay?
