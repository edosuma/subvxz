01:27.984 --> 01:29.286
- What the hell is this?

01:31.624 --> 01:32.845
No.

01:32.845 --> 01:33.747
No!

01:33.747 --> 01:35.238
No, what are you doin'?

01:35.238 --> 01:36.071
No!

01:39.646 --> 01:40.479
Let go.

01:40.479 --> 01:42.087
No!

01:49.296 --> 01:51.965
- So, my childs, today I make history.

01:51.965 --> 01:54.505
- Let me outta
here, I'm an American!

01:54.505 --> 01:58.177
- You look especially pretty today.

01:58.177 --> 02:01.094
Tonight you will celebrate with me.

02:12.726 --> 02:16.559
Dr. Herman Baumgartner,
31st of October, 1958.

02:17.605 --> 02:21.625
Alpha X-Ray Series, human trial, zero set.

02:21.625 --> 02:25.845
Subject 13 will be injected
with the updated virus,

02:25.845 --> 02:27.345
Alpha X-Ray Zebra.

02:28.194 --> 02:30.534
- We should have nuked
all you Nazi bastards!

02:30.534 --> 02:32.555
- Keep the specimen quiet.
- Specimen?

02:32.555 --> 02:37.555
What the hell's that supposed
to mean, you Nazi?

02:55.603 --> 02:57.873
- Maybe you are the one.

02:57.873 --> 02:58.706
Yah.

03:22.208 --> 03:25.268
- Stop this immediately, shut
this operation down right now.

03:25.268 --> 03:29.158
- Ah, General, just in time
to celebrate my victory.

03:29.158 --> 03:30.128
- Your victory?

03:30.128 --> 03:33.420
I said shut it down, this is
no longer a sanctioned project.

03:33.420 --> 03:37.089
- General, the importance
of my work is indisputable.

03:37.089 --> 03:38.809
You of all should know that.

03:38.809 --> 03:40.660
- You've got your orders, Baumgartner.

03:40.660 --> 03:43.728
- "Orders."

03:43.728 --> 03:45.648
Orders are for mindless sheep.

03:45.648 --> 03:50.577
- Enough of your Third
Reich delusions, arrest him!

03:50.577 --> 03:53.128
You overstepped for the last time.

03:53.128 --> 03:55.118
Go ahead and smile, Herman.

03:55.118 --> 03:58.368
One word from me and you won't
see daylight for 20 years.

03:58.368 --> 04:01.278
- Haven't you heard, my general?

04:01.278 --> 04:03.195
I work for the CIA now.

04:05.220 --> 04:06.053
May I?

04:13.997 --> 04:14.830
It's over.

04:18.208 --> 04:20.237
- The hell it is!

04:20.237 --> 04:22.157
I should never have allowed this.

04:22.157 --> 04:25.298
- Isn't it a bit late to be
developing morals, General?

04:25.298 --> 04:28.465
- I'm gettin' you outta here, soldier.

04:29.997 --> 04:32.378
It's gonna be okay.

04:43.296 --> 04:44.576
- We're damned!

04:44.576 --> 04:45.409
Not again!

05:11.710 --> 05:13.210
- Help me!

06:17.971 --> 06:19.561
- What did I say, gentlemen?

06:19.561 --> 06:20.862
- Wow.

06:20.862 --> 06:22.601
- Oh, yeah.

06:22.601 --> 06:24.113
I could totally get down with this.

06:24.113 --> 06:26.353
- Welcome, welcome, you must be--

06:26.353 --> 06:29.382
- Ethan, and these are my
mates, John and Daniel.

06:29.382 --> 06:31.673
I reckon we might wanna
get us some trouble, lads.

06:31.673 --> 06:35.281
- In that case, you won't want
to miss our cocktail brunch.

06:35.281 --> 06:36.864
- My kind of place.

06:40.190 --> 06:41.451
Hello, ladies.

06:41.451 --> 06:43.329
Three princesses all alone?

06:43.329 --> 06:45.261
This will not do.

06:45.261 --> 06:47.186
- Who's ready
to start with a drink?

06:47.186 --> 06:49.589
- Me!
- Alright, bring it on!

06:49.589 --> 06:51.089
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

07:07.819 --> 07:08.986
- Final round.

07:10.369 --> 07:13.070
I call this Death in the Jungle.

07:13.070 --> 07:14.419
- Sounds final.

07:14.419 --> 07:15.836
- Down the hatch!

07:24.227 --> 07:26.609
- That settles it, you're coming with us.

07:26.609 --> 07:29.217
- Coming where?
- Down the river, on a raft.

07:29.217 --> 07:31.497
We're goin' tomorrow.
- Yay!

07:31.497 --> 07:35.497
- Cheers to that.

07:37.147 --> 07:40.347
- I need more coffee.
- Where is she?

07:40.347 --> 07:42.747
- It usually takes her a
little while to get ready.

07:42.747 --> 07:45.926
- We're going into the jungle.

07:45.926 --> 07:47.009
- Oh, my god.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.939
- Well, hello, gorgeous.

08:22.667 --> 08:27.667
- What are you waiting for?

08:53.664 --> 08:55.394
- Steer to the left, everybody.

08:55.394 --> 08:56.977
- No, to the right.

08:59.235 --> 09:01.301
- The guy told us to follow
the route on the map.

09:01.301 --> 09:03.122
- So what, man?

09:03.122 --> 09:05.442
He told us not to drink, too.

09:05.442 --> 09:07.363
And what do ya know?

09:07.363 --> 09:09.821
- Dude, could you ever
be, like, not a dick?

09:09.821 --> 09:11.291
- It'll be an adventure!

09:11.291 --> 09:12.322
- Think about it.

09:12.322 --> 09:14.613
Everybody follows the
route on the map, right?

09:14.613 --> 09:17.282
This way, we'll have the
river all to ourselves.

09:17.282 --> 09:19.312
- Oh, our very own river!

09:19.312 --> 09:21.312
- I mean, it's not like
these are raging waters.

09:21.312 --> 09:23.322
- And it looks like they'll
join again in a few miles.

09:23.322 --> 09:26.091
- I think it's a bad idea.
- I agree.

09:26.091 --> 09:29.552
- Dude, think of it as a
navigational challenge!

09:29.552 --> 09:33.472
Get us through uncharted
waters, oh wise one.

09:33.472 --> 09:34.642
- You're an idiot.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.733
- It should be fine if we're careful.

09:36.733 --> 09:38.093
- It could be fun.

09:38.093 --> 09:39.931
- See? She's up for it.

09:39.931 --> 09:42.381
- I guess.
- It's decided!

09:42.381 --> 09:43.941
- Nothing dangerous, though.

09:43.941 --> 09:46.453
- Admit it, you're loving it.

10:46.856 --> 10:48.347
- Oh.

10:48.347 --> 10:49.180
Wow!

10:52.488 --> 10:53.998
- What did I say, guys?

10:53.998 --> 10:56.507
Our own private sanctuary.

10:56.507 --> 10:57.368
Sweet!

10:57.368 --> 10:59.368
- Everybody glad we came this way?

10:59.368 --> 11:01.568
- I can't believe they
blocked this place off.

11:01.568 --> 11:02.401
- Ladies?

11:03.407 --> 11:04.408
- What the hell are you doin'?

11:04.408 --> 11:05.598
They told us to keep our life vests on!

11:05.598 --> 11:07.998
- Chill, does this look dangerous to you?

11:07.998 --> 11:10.347
- Yeah, no danger
of goin' overboard.

11:10.347 --> 11:11.180
Psyche!

11:12.019 --> 11:13.400
- You idiot!

11:21.172 --> 11:22.730
- The water's awesome!

11:22.730 --> 11:24.147
- I wanna get in!

11:27.620 --> 11:30.340
Oh, yes!

11:30.340 --> 11:32.423
God bless you, waterfall.

12:24.993 --> 12:26.576
- Where's the boat?

12:30.382 --> 12:31.799
Where's the boat?

12:32.852 --> 12:34.742
- What? How? I, uh--
- No!

12:34.742 --> 12:36.412
- That's great.
- How did it get loose?

12:36.412 --> 12:38.872
- You didn't tie it up right.
- Yes, I did!

12:38.872 --> 12:41.252
- You think this is his fault?

12:41.252 --> 12:43.342
There's no signal.
- We are so screwed.

12:43.342 --> 12:44.312
- What are we gonna do now?

12:44.312 --> 12:45.724
- Somebody will come and find us.

12:45.724 --> 12:46.872
- They'll send a search party.

12:46.872 --> 12:50.804
- Um, that may help, if we
hadn't taken the wrong fork.

12:50.804 --> 12:51.637
- Oh, no!

12:52.542 --> 12:53.942
We're lost?

12:53.942 --> 12:56.102
- Oh, we can make our way
back to the other river arm.

12:56.102 --> 12:57.284
- Yeah, yeah, it looks like it,

12:57.284 --> 12:58.993
but that's at least a mile back.

12:58.993 --> 13:01.362
- We'll have to walk.
- What, through the jungle?

13:01.362 --> 13:02.473
- Oh, are you nuts?

13:02.473 --> 13:04.492
It's, it's impossible!

13:04.492 --> 13:06.604
- Do you have another
idea, Mr. Two Rules Down?

13:06.604 --> 13:09.272
- Let's move, we do wanna make
it back before it gets dark.

13:09.272 --> 13:11.924
- I'll protect you.

13:11.924 --> 13:12.757
Oh, shit!

13:13.662 --> 13:16.632
That frickin' hurts,
what's wrong with you?

13:16.632 --> 13:18.702
- She doesn't like guys touching her.

13:18.702 --> 13:20.892
- You should get your clothes on.

13:32.917 --> 13:34.576
- Stupid jungle!

13:34.576 --> 13:36.155
Ow, ow!

13:36.155 --> 13:38.765
- Tiffany you've got
to lose those ridiculous shoes.

13:38.765 --> 13:40.245
- I can't walk barefoot
through the jungle.

13:40.245 --> 13:41.331
- You're going to break your neck

13:41.331 --> 13:43.317
before we make it outta here.

13:43.317 --> 13:47.016
- She's right, Tiff, you could
probably walk faster, too.

13:47.016 --> 13:47.849
- Fine.

13:58.147 --> 13:59.314
Wait up, guys.

14:01.986 --> 14:02.819
Ew, ew.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.357
I don't wanna walk anymore!

14:23.488 --> 14:24.905
Are we there yet?

14:26.779 --> 14:28.087
- A path!

14:28.087 --> 14:29.659
Dudes, dudes, a path!

14:29.659 --> 14:31.767
A path, woo-hoo!

14:31.767 --> 14:32.600
Oh, yeah!

14:38.327 --> 14:39.160
Holy shit.

14:54.802 --> 14:57.969
- How did it get all the way out here?

15:00.321 --> 15:02.301
- Let's check it out.
- If we can climb to the top,

15:02.301 --> 15:04.471
we might be able to see where we are.

15:04.471 --> 15:05.970
- She makes a good point.

15:05.970 --> 15:07.387
- Let's go, then.

15:49.227 --> 15:51.358
- This isn't like anything I've ever seen.

15:51.358 --> 15:54.046
- It looks kinda creepy.

15:54.046 --> 15:57.169
- Like Jungle Dracula's castle.

15:57.169 --> 15:59.718
- Well, we're not moving in.

15:59.718 --> 16:01.718
Let's go, Mr. Adventure.

16:04.507 --> 16:06.458
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- Back off, Ethan.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.267
We don't need any more
trouble, understand?

16:08.267 --> 16:11.067
- You're the boss.

16:11.067 --> 16:13.317
- What are you waitin' for?

16:15.827 --> 16:17.238
- Hey, babe.

16:17.238 --> 16:19.198
We got our orders.

16:19.198 --> 16:22.948
Let's get drunk.
- Yay, finally something fun!

16:34.352 --> 16:35.769
- Rise and shine!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.667
Scream, if you must.

16:40.472 --> 16:42.139
No one can hear you!

16:50.340 --> 16:51.752
See?

16:51.752 --> 16:53.585
Nobody around to help.

16:58.481 --> 17:01.398
I tweaked the formula just for you.

17:03.551 --> 17:05.468
You have to be the one.

17:22.843 --> 17:25.343
You might feel a little prick.

17:29.252 --> 17:32.343
Hold still!

17:54.700 --> 17:55.617
Oh, bugger!

17:58.509 --> 17:59.342
- Yo.

18:01.340 --> 18:02.281
- Just what I wanna do.

18:02.281 --> 18:04.729
Get wasted while we're lost in the jungle.

18:04.729 --> 18:07.146
- Come on, it's good for you!

18:11.780 --> 18:15.030
- What do you think that says?

18:18.620 --> 18:20.529
- We're not makin'
it out of here by nightfall.

18:20.529 --> 18:22.569
- There's gotta be a way.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.180
- In the dark?

18:24.180 --> 18:28.347
We're lucky if we have two
hours of daylight left.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.449
- That's enough.

18:31.449 --> 18:34.866
- It took us three hours to get this far.

18:37.361 --> 18:40.361
- Hey, guys, check this out.

18:42.550 --> 18:44.149
- Oh, yay!

18:44.149 --> 18:46.670
- Good, you brought
some disinfectant along!

18:46.670 --> 18:48.809
We'll need it when you burn your face off.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.493
- Why doesn't it work!

18:53.593 --> 18:55.223
Yes, I did.

18:55.223 --> 18:56.240
I do!

18:56.240 --> 18:58.490
It's her fault, god damnit!

18:59.953 --> 19:02.120
I'll show you, you'll see.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.839
I can do it!

19:04.839 --> 19:08.339
I do have it in me, I will make you proud!

19:10.132 --> 19:12.549
The world will know our name.

19:13.703 --> 19:15.870
You useless piece of meat!

19:19.033 --> 19:20.366
What did you do?

19:22.591 --> 19:24.924
It's all your fucking fault!

19:28.301 --> 19:29.134
Fuck!

19:40.840 --> 19:43.423
I guess you'll join the others.

19:45.160 --> 19:47.450
- What did you guys see?

19:47.450 --> 19:50.560
- We're havin' a sleepover!
- Ha ha ha, very funny.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.720
- Unfortunately, it's no joke.
- No, there's gotta be a path.

19:53.720 --> 19:57.053
- Only jungle as far as the eye can see.

19:58.682 --> 20:01.932
- We need to take shelter in the ruins.

20:02.890 --> 20:04.351
What?

20:04.351 --> 20:06.450
I saw it on Man Versus Wild once.

20:06.450 --> 20:07.530
Sheltering for the night is the most

20:07.530 --> 20:09.613
important survival skill.

20:11.095 --> 20:13.260
- I guess we better check it out, then.

20:59.909 --> 21:01.326
- Hurry up, guys!

21:03.906 --> 21:05.989
- Whoa.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.568
- This is is lit!
- No way.

21:10.568 --> 21:12.401
- This is lit.

21:14.163 --> 21:16.343
- See? I told you guys
this was a good idea.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.355
- Good call, babe.

21:17.355 --> 21:20.433
- I wonder what this looked like before.

21:20.433 --> 21:22.523
- I hear they used to do human sacrifice

21:22.523 --> 21:24.912
in places like this.
- What?

21:24.912 --> 21:28.412
- Yeah, every 13th day of every 13th year.

21:31.113 --> 21:32.984
Which is tonight!

21:32.984 --> 21:35.303
- Leave her alone, guys.

21:35.303 --> 21:38.064
Nobody died here, probably.

21:38.064 --> 21:40.904
- I'll be totally missing my
flight 'cause of you guys.

22:24.519 --> 22:25.900
- Guys.

22:25.900 --> 22:28.700
- What are you doing?

22:28.700 --> 22:32.450
- There's somethin' in here.
- What something?

22:33.519 --> 22:35.461
- You see it?
- What is it?

22:35.461 --> 22:36.970
Get your hand outta there!

22:36.970 --> 22:38.460
What are you doing, dude?

22:38.460 --> 22:39.439
Stop!

22:39.439 --> 22:40.272
- Almost.

22:42.599 --> 22:43.911
There.

22:43.911 --> 22:45.231
Oh, sweet!

22:45.231 --> 22:47.100
- Whoa, dude!
- What is that doing here?

22:47.100 --> 22:47.933
- Awesome.

22:49.340 --> 22:50.930
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:50.930 --> 22:52.050
- Let's see if it works.

22:52.050 --> 22:53.831
- Don't, if the barrel is damaged,

22:53.831 --> 22:55.930
it could misfire and tear your hand off.

22:55.930 --> 22:57.680
- I'll give it a try.

23:02.140 --> 23:04.231
- Stay back.

23:05.741 --> 23:07.461
- Geez!
- It works!

23:07.461 --> 23:09.349
Yeah!

23:09.349 --> 23:10.199
Let me have a shot.

23:10.199 --> 23:11.621
- Maybe we should save the bullets,

23:11.621 --> 23:13.431
being stuck out here all night?

23:13.431 --> 23:17.598
- I'll take this.

23:27.509 --> 23:28.869
- Oh!

23:28.869 --> 23:30.036
A secret room!

23:46.399 --> 23:47.399
- Holy crap.

23:52.171 --> 23:54.349
- What's this
doing in these ruins?

23:54.349 --> 23:55.879
- Let's go down.

23:55.879 --> 23:57.409
- I'm not going down there.

23:57.409 --> 24:00.739
- There's some type of
old facility down there.

24:00.739 --> 24:02.109
- No, not going!

24:02.109 --> 24:03.379
- I wanna check it out.

24:03.379 --> 24:05.120
- Even Pussiana Jones is up for it.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.508
- Yes, baby bro!

24:06.508 --> 24:09.219
- Oh, come on, I'll look after you.

24:09.219 --> 24:10.440
- Let's do it.

24:10.440 --> 24:14.419
- Okay, fine, but you're
not leaving my side.

24:14.419 --> 24:15.502
- Step aside.

24:35.471 --> 24:38.261
- Oh, another secret room!

24:38.261 --> 24:39.701
- Here we go.

24:39.701 --> 24:42.220
- What was going on down here?

24:42.220 --> 24:44.137
- And who was doing it?

24:46.749 --> 24:48.082
- I've got this.

24:58.189 --> 25:00.189
- Step back, Tinkerbell.

25:09.549 --> 25:11.716
You gonna help me or what?

25:16.770 --> 25:18.603
- So strong.

25:19.930 --> 25:20.847
You did it!

25:29.050 --> 25:31.879
- Oh, wow.

25:31.879 --> 25:34.046
- This is amazing.

25:44.837 --> 25:45.670
- Jackpot.

25:46.538 --> 25:47.705
- It's so big.

25:50.138 --> 25:52.721
- I'm so glad we lost the boat.

25:59.698 --> 26:01.677
This is ancient.

26:01.677 --> 26:04.837
- It's kinda like they
built one structure,

26:04.837 --> 26:07.197
on top of another one.

26:07.197 --> 26:10.280
- Like Rome, a city on top of a city.

26:11.686 --> 26:13.357
- So, why the Fort Knox door?

26:13.357 --> 26:16.024
- Yeah, there's nothing in here.

26:18.487 --> 26:20.237
- Let's check it out.

26:25.468 --> 26:26.885
Look at the eyes.

26:30.178 --> 26:33.011
Maybe some type of warrior temple?

26:49.635 --> 26:51.195
- It's closing!

26:59.551 --> 27:02.461
- Wow, that was great!

27:02.461 --> 27:03.794
- Nice reflexes.

27:04.850 --> 27:07.069
- It's just a door.

27:07.069 --> 27:10.829
- I always say you
should go out for track.

27:10.829 --> 27:14.078
But he was more into his books.

27:15.869 --> 27:17.818
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

27:17.818 --> 27:19.568
- That is disgusting.

27:21.530 --> 27:23.250
- What is that?

27:23.250 --> 27:25.269
- It looks like blood.
- Oh, shut up.

27:25.269 --> 27:29.019
I can't believe this
shit, I need some water.

27:40.569 --> 27:41.486
- Oi, guys!

27:42.448 --> 27:43.698
Come over here.

28:00.162 --> 28:01.162
- Watch out.

28:37.418 --> 28:39.835
- This isn't so scary, is it?

28:54.785 --> 28:57.795
- Alright, check it out.

28:57.795 --> 29:01.196
- What is that?
- It's an old generator.

29:01.196 --> 29:03.835
- A really old one.
- Don't touch it!

29:03.835 --> 29:05.135
- You don't know what that does.

29:05.135 --> 29:06.625
- Get out of my way.

29:06.625 --> 29:08.125
- Chill out, guys.

29:10.985 --> 29:13.325
- This looks military to me.

29:13.325 --> 29:16.325
CIA was doing stuff out here in the 50s.

29:16.325 --> 29:18.695
- CIA?
- Yeah, during the Cold War.

29:18.695 --> 29:21.105
Trying to overthrow the communists.

29:21.105 --> 29:23.647
- A lot of people disappeared.

29:23.647 --> 29:26.727
- Well, there better not
be any skeletons down here.

29:26.727 --> 29:28.305
- Or ghosts.

29:28.305 --> 29:29.722
- Shut up, Ethan.

29:33.527 --> 29:35.044
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck?

29:35.044 --> 29:36.265
- Oh, no!
- What happened?

29:36.265 --> 29:37.796
- Well, I'm glad
we didn't split up.

29:37.796 --> 29:39.225
Wouldn't wanna get lost down here.

29:39.225 --> 29:41.665
- Oh, this
is not good, not good.

29:41.665 --> 29:43.476
- I'm scared.

29:43.476 --> 29:45.995
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait.

29:45.995 --> 29:47.355
I might be able to get her going.

29:47.355 --> 29:49.367
- Why?
- Lights.

29:49.367 --> 29:50.200
Duh!

30:05.493 --> 30:09.160
There we go.

30:37.121 --> 30:39.454
- Oh, finally!
- Yay, lights!

30:40.437 --> 30:42.354
- Nice work, bro!
- Yes!

30:44.909 --> 30:48.157
Pretty cool, huh?

30:48.157 --> 30:50.558
- My hero.
- It's a furnace.

30:50.558 --> 30:52.308
- Hey, guys, come on.

31:07.806 --> 31:10.326
- My feet hurt!
- This is incredible.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.897
- Like, really hurt.
- Careful.

31:12.897 --> 31:14.814
- Check it out.
- Hello?

31:20.256 --> 31:21.589
- Whoa.

31:23.377 --> 31:25.294
- What do we have here?

31:26.405 --> 31:29.155
- It's some kind of control room.

31:31.945 --> 31:34.177
- Check it out.

31:34.177 --> 31:35.010
Sweet.

31:54.694 --> 31:56.585
- Shut it off!
- What did you do?

31:56.585 --> 31:59.752
- How do you turn it off?
- I'm trying!

32:01.843 --> 32:04.163
- I'm practically deaf!

32:04.163 --> 32:06.503
- There's no picture.
- Patience, it's CRT.

32:06.503 --> 32:10.003
It takes a while for the tubes to warm up.

32:11.134 --> 32:13.953
- Someone wanted to keep
an eye on things down here.

32:13.953 --> 32:16.873
Maybe we can see what they
were trying to keep an eye on.

32:16.873 --> 32:21.040
- Whoa.

32:22.553 --> 32:23.913
- Ew.
- Oh, my god.

32:23.913 --> 32:24.996
What is that?

32:26.782 --> 32:29.273
- We're gonna do some exploring.

32:29.273 --> 32:32.182
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Don't catch anything.

32:32.182 --> 32:36.430
You're gonna get it working?
- Just give me a few.

32:36.430 --> 32:38.847
- Come on, let's look around.

32:41.732 --> 32:45.582
- Okay, let's see if our
superior 21st century

32:45.582 --> 32:49.169
digital knowledge can
crack this analog puzzle.

32:55.922 --> 32:57.881
- It's kinda creepy.

32:57.881 --> 33:00.042
- I'll show you creepy.

33:15.437 --> 33:16.270
Tiff?

33:19.755 --> 33:20.588
Tiff?

33:22.938 --> 33:24.188
Where'd you go?

33:25.310 --> 33:26.143
Tiffany?

33:30.387 --> 33:31.220
Tiff?

33:34.307 --> 33:35.140
Tiffany.

33:38.300 --> 33:40.140
Where are you?

33:40.140 --> 33:40.973
Tiffany!

33:48.747 --> 33:50.664
Tiffany, where are you?

33:54.229 --> 33:55.062
Tiffany?

33:57.201 --> 33:58.034
Tiff.

34:01.349 --> 34:02.182
Tiffany?

34:04.178 --> 34:06.578
- We did it!

34:06.578 --> 34:09.730
- We are officially awesome.

34:14.998 --> 34:17.498
- What do you think they
were doin' down here?

34:17.498 --> 34:18.331
- No idea.

34:22.806 --> 34:25.388
- This could have been
a Cold War command center.

34:25.388 --> 34:30.054
- Looks like there was some
fighting going on down here.

34:30.908 --> 34:33.527
- What about secret experiments?

34:33.527 --> 34:36.158
- You have a vivid imagination.

34:36.158 --> 34:37.838
- Aliens.

34:37.838 --> 34:42.838
Did you hear that?

34:42.967 --> 34:45.969
John.

34:45.969 --> 34:47.370
- Daniel?

34:47.370 --> 34:49.806
- Little Brother is watching you.

34:49.806 --> 34:53.038
- We can see you,
but we can't hear you.

34:53.038 --> 34:57.788
- We got the cameras
working, come check it out.

35:02.188 --> 35:04.228
- Oh, shit.

35:04.228 --> 35:05.395
There you are.

35:06.530 --> 35:07.697
You scared me.

35:10.098 --> 35:11.015
All for me?

35:17.970 --> 35:20.310
Oh, I could just eat you up.

35:20.310 --> 35:21.143
- Okay.

35:38.805 --> 35:39.805
Right there.

35:40.855 --> 35:41.772
Don't stop.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.997
- Good job, little bro.
- Where's Tiffany and Ethan?

35:45.997 --> 35:50.356
- They haven't come back yet.
- Let me try to find them.

35:50.356 --> 35:52.626
- Oh, hell no, turn it off, turn it off.

35:52.626 --> 35:54.105
- Go, Ethan!

35:54.105 --> 35:57.246
- Tiffany, whatever it is you're
doing you might wanna stop.

35:57.246 --> 35:59.105
The cameras are rolling.

35:59.105 --> 36:00.022
Guys, guys.

36:01.676 --> 36:04.606
They can't hear me.
- I'll go find them.

36:22.515 --> 36:24.765
- I need those final notes.

36:27.987 --> 36:32.717
I could get around all those
undead freaks down there,

36:32.717 --> 36:34.467
if it wasn't for him.

36:35.356 --> 36:37.273
He has all the secrets.

36:38.485 --> 36:40.402
The key to immortality.

36:43.056 --> 36:44.696
Father!

36:44.696 --> 36:46.605
What should I do?

36:46.605 --> 36:49.355
Please tell me, what should I do?

37:00.397 --> 37:01.564
They found it.

37:02.445 --> 37:03.278
Good.

37:07.656 --> 37:10.325
I will take care of it.

37:10.325 --> 37:12.492
Yes, I know how important.

37:14.405 --> 37:15.905
I'll go right now!

37:18.816 --> 37:19.649
Heil!

37:22.837 --> 37:23.670
- Tiff?

37:25.005 --> 37:28.505
Tiffany?

37:31.345 --> 37:32.825
- Oh.

37:32.825 --> 37:34.776
- You guys find
anything interesting?

37:34.776 --> 37:35.835
- Oh, yeah.

37:35.835 --> 37:37.335
Yeah.
- Not really!

37:42.757 --> 37:44.840
- Did you change?

37:45.976 --> 37:46.809
- Yeah!

37:48.397 --> 37:50.085
- Come on, we
got the monitors working.

37:50.085 --> 37:51.725
- Oh!

37:51.725 --> 37:53.225
See anything cool?

37:55.147 --> 37:56.405
- You could say that.

37:58.645 --> 38:00.286
- Holy shit!

38:00.286 --> 38:02.254
- Oh my god, oh my god!

38:02.254 --> 38:04.126
Oh my god, Ethan!

38:04.126 --> 38:05.046
Where is she?

38:05.046 --> 38:07.734
- I don't give a shit, run!

38:07.734 --> 38:09.286
- We can't just leave her here!

38:09.286 --> 38:11.536
- Then you go back for her!

38:20.157 --> 38:22.197
- Something took Aneesha!
- What?

38:22.197 --> 38:24.477
- Something grabbed her
and dragged her off!

38:24.477 --> 38:28.208
- How much did you guys drink?
- We saw it!

38:28.208 --> 38:30.517
- Saw what, Tiffany?

38:30.517 --> 38:33.587
- I don't know, it was disgusting.

38:33.587 --> 38:35.568
- We're getting the fuck out of here, now.

38:35.568 --> 38:37.288
- Ethan, stop.

38:37.288 --> 38:38.848
What happened?

38:38.848 --> 38:42.098
- There is something down here with us.

38:43.219 --> 38:45.485
It's gonna kill us all.
- What?

38:45.485 --> 38:48.985
Where's Aneesha?
- She's fuckin' dead, man!

39:11.486 --> 39:12.319
- Come on.

40:43.863 --> 40:45.895
- Where are we?

40:45.895 --> 40:47.724
It all looks the same down here!

40:47.724 --> 40:49.884
- You're supposed to know
which way we're going.

40:49.884 --> 40:52.434
- I can't find her anywhere.

40:52.434 --> 40:54.783
- I'm gonna go look for her.

40:54.783 --> 40:56.783
- I'll go with you.
- No.

40:58.095 --> 40:59.303
You two stay here.

40:59.303 --> 41:00.283
- Let's go this way!

41:00.283 --> 41:02.103
- We just came from that way, you idiot.

41:02.103 --> 41:04.283
- I'm just trying to help.
- Well, stop trying!

41:04.283 --> 41:07.783
- Asshole!

41:15.963 --> 41:17.564
Ethan!

41:19.935 --> 41:23.695
- Don't worry.

41:23.695 --> 41:25.362
I'll look after you.

41:53.092 --> 41:55.092
- What is this?

41:59.452 --> 42:02.452
- They were experimenting on people.

42:03.730 --> 42:08.612
- "Integrated power viral
genetic, transform the weakling

42:08.612 --> 42:12.732
"of the battlefield
into a veritable sup..."

42:12.732 --> 42:15.031
They were trying to create super soldiers.

42:51.759 --> 42:52.592
- Aneesha!

43:33.583 --> 43:34.416
Aneesha.

44:35.083 --> 44:36.313
Shit!

44:47.383 --> 44:49.691
- Here we are, darling.

44:49.691 --> 44:51.274
Isn't it beautiful?

44:52.431 --> 44:55.764
I've been waiting to find you, my angel.

44:56.901 --> 45:01.234
And here you are at last,
sharing my heart, my home.

45:02.503 --> 45:07.003
When I'm with you, I really
feel like I can be myself.

45:11.380 --> 45:13.620
The stars are aligned.

45:13.620 --> 45:16.953
We will dance amongst them for eternity.

45:59.773 --> 46:00.911
- We gotta go.

46:00.911 --> 46:02.173
- Did you find her?

46:02.173 --> 46:04.412
- No, there is something
really bad going on.

46:04.412 --> 46:05.482
- What?

46:05.482 --> 46:08.232
- I don't know, but I found this.

46:09.692 --> 46:12.442
- Shit!
- We gotta get outta here.

46:14.434 --> 46:17.473
- There's Ethan, he made it to the exit!

46:19.323 --> 46:20.490
- Who's there?

46:21.874 --> 46:23.263
Hey!

46:25.603 --> 46:26.603
Who's there?

46:29.783 --> 46:31.474
Open up the bloody door!

46:31.474 --> 46:36.224
- You can't go, you have to
help me with my pest problem.

46:38.446 --> 46:39.279
- Open up!

46:43.375 --> 46:44.208
Damnit!

46:54.111 --> 46:56.278
- Oh, shit.
- What is that?

46:57.482 --> 46:59.071
- It's freakin' huge.

46:59.071 --> 47:02.402
- I think it's headed toward Ethan.

47:02.402 --> 47:03.663
- Ethan, Ethan, can you hear me?

47:03.663 --> 47:04.692
There's something coming your way.

47:04.692 --> 47:06.941
You've gotta find another way out.

47:06.941 --> 47:08.700
- Run, bro!

47:08.700 --> 47:09.533
- No shit!

47:15.383 --> 47:19.466
Fuck.

47:41.736 --> 47:42.917
Hey.

47:42.917 --> 47:44.305
Hey!

47:44.305 --> 47:48.222
Hey.

48:18.875 --> 48:19.875
Oh, fuck me.

48:21.004 --> 48:21.837
Stay back!

48:23.935 --> 48:26.195
You stay the fuck away from me!

48:26.195 --> 48:27.028
Stay back!

48:54.720 --> 48:56.788
- Get out of there!

48:56.788 --> 48:57.621
- People.

48:59.059 --> 49:00.392
You want people.

49:01.979 --> 49:04.562
I've got lots of people for ya.

49:06.808 --> 49:08.641
They're back that way.

49:09.517 --> 49:10.350
Come on.

49:13.469 --> 49:15.309
- What's he doing?

49:15.309 --> 49:17.217
- Come on.

49:17.217 --> 49:18.050
That's it.

49:19.997 --> 49:21.738
I can help you.

49:21.738 --> 49:24.071
- He's leading it somewhere.

49:25.949 --> 49:27.949
- I'm gonna hook you up.

49:34.368 --> 49:35.451
I'm your man.

49:37.428 --> 49:38.989
See?

49:38.989 --> 49:40.739
You need me, come on.

49:42.128 --> 49:43.341
This way.

49:43.341 --> 49:44.174
Almost.

49:47.280 --> 49:48.113
No.

50:03.641 --> 50:04.720
No!

50:04.720 --> 50:08.137
I can help you!

50:12.965 --> 50:13.798
Don't!

51:40.345 --> 51:42.774
- We gotta get out of this place.

51:42.774 --> 51:43.607
- Yeah.

52:11.494 --> 52:13.911
- I, I can track it.

52:14.793 --> 52:15.793
There it is.

52:19.684 --> 52:23.267
- Where'd it go?
- It went into a dead zone.

52:29.164 --> 52:31.983
- This is really messed up.

52:31.983 --> 52:34.713
We are so screwed, how are
we gettin' out of here?

52:34.713 --> 52:35.546
Fuck!

54:33.545 --> 54:37.795
- There's gotta be another
god damn way outta here.

54:39.676 --> 54:41.825
- The generator.
- What?

54:41.825 --> 54:43.613
- Remember the generator?

54:43.613 --> 54:46.873
There has to be an exhaust vent, right?

54:46.873 --> 54:48.484
Wouldn't that lead to the top?

54:48.484 --> 54:50.294
- Maybe we
could climb through it.

54:50.294 --> 54:51.865
- Good idea.

54:51.865 --> 54:52.698
Let's go.

55:06.406 --> 55:08.414
- Is this the way?
- I don't know.

55:08.414 --> 55:11.081
None of this was on the cameras.

55:15.995 --> 55:17.662
- Let's go this way.

55:26.132 --> 55:29.673
- Look out, look out, go, go!

55:34.301 --> 55:36.542
- Help me, help me!

55:36.542 --> 55:38.199
It's a door, get it open.

55:38.199 --> 55:40.151
- I don't know how, I can't!

55:40.151 --> 55:41.700
- Guys, in here, in here, come on!

55:41.700 --> 55:44.617
- I can't get it!
- Forget about it.

55:54.966 --> 55:57.049
- In here, guys, in here.

56:01.174 --> 56:02.424
- Yes!

56:03.806 --> 56:05.633
- We can climb out.

56:05.633 --> 56:06.466
Come on.

56:13.302 --> 56:15.969
Shit.

56:19.377 --> 56:22.460
- It's really slippery.
- I can do it.

56:29.316 --> 56:30.149
Oh, god!

56:32.257 --> 56:33.257
Fuck.
- Damn.

56:35.325 --> 56:36.158
- Fuck!

59:35.587 --> 59:37.777
- What are we gonna do?

59:37.777 --> 59:39.587
Oh my god, they're coming.

59:39.587 --> 59:41.754
- What? Oh, shit!

59:43.206 --> 59:45.518
- I'm gonna distract them.
- How, with that?

59:45.518 --> 59:47.107
- Don't worry about it, just go!

59:47.107 --> 59:48.558
- I'm not leaving you.

59:48.558 --> 59:50.897
There's no way, I'm not going to!

59:50.897 --> 59:54.896
- I'll be right behind you, I promise.

01:00:01.947 --> 01:00:05.147
- Oh my god, oh my god.
- Leave him alone!

01:00:05.147 --> 01:00:05.980
- Go!

01:00:13.947 --> 01:00:15.280
Get off me, man!

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.713
Oh, shit.

01:01:41.483 --> 01:01:42.983
- Daniel, come on!

01:01:52.922 --> 01:01:54.363
Try in here!

01:01:54.363 --> 01:01:56.030
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:51.133
- Look at this.

01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:57.053
- What is it?

01:02:58.490 --> 01:02:59.740
- I don't know.

01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:14.248
- I believe I have finally done it.

01:03:14.248 --> 01:03:17.451
The animal subjects are
showing promising results.

01:03:17.451 --> 01:03:19.989
Some of them have lived
for up to five minutes

01:03:19.989 --> 01:03:22.408
after the injection.

01:03:22.408 --> 01:03:26.075
The possibilities I can
see now are endless.

01:03:27.539 --> 01:03:32.319
And with the funding of the
Americans I can finish the work.

01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:34.486
Das Reich will rise again.

01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:44.939
- It really was the Nazis.

01:03:44.939 --> 01:03:46.749
Working with Americans?

01:03:46.749 --> 01:03:49.109
- Yeah, it happened a lot.

01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:53.019
We took their top
scientists after the war.

01:03:53.019 --> 01:03:57.559
- So, they created a virus
that reanimates the dead?

01:03:57.559 --> 01:04:02.080
- I don't think
that's what they meant to do.

01:04:32.114 --> 01:04:33.416
- How?

01:04:33.416 --> 01:04:36.083
How are we gonna get outta here?

01:05:46.323 --> 01:05:47.573
- Formaldehyde.

01:05:48.784 --> 01:05:50.784
- What are you thinking?

01:05:51.892 --> 01:05:53.323
- It's highly flammable.

01:06:36.271 --> 01:06:37.104
- Go!

01:06:38.722 --> 01:06:39.555
Shit!

01:06:41.642 --> 01:06:42.559
No, no, no!

01:07:17.119 --> 01:07:17.952
- Aneesha?

01:07:19.557 --> 01:07:21.569
- You guys wanna split?
- Yes.

01:07:21.569 --> 01:07:22.402
- Yeah.

01:07:23.908 --> 01:07:26.325
- Are you alright?
- I'm okay.

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:45.849
- Where is everybody else?

01:07:45.849 --> 01:07:47.099
- Ethan's dead.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.429
- And we don't know about the others.

01:07:51.429 --> 01:07:52.262
- Oh.

01:07:53.188 --> 01:07:55.521
I think this belongs to you.

01:08:09.179 --> 01:08:10.470
- Wait!

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:11.470
What's that?

01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:16.120
- I've been here six months now.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.122
I'm the only one left.

01:08:18.122 --> 01:08:19.990
They took George this morning.

01:08:27.301 --> 01:08:29.884
What the hell's happenin' here?

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.640
Let me out!

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.071
George?

01:08:42.071 --> 01:08:44.821
What have they done to ya?

01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:48.268
George, no.

01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:51.318
Don't you recognize me?

01:08:53.433 --> 01:08:54.350
Look at me!

01:08:55.794 --> 01:08:57.444
You know me!

01:08:57.444 --> 01:08:58.872
We were cellmates.

01:08:58.872 --> 01:09:00.363
George!

01:09:00.363 --> 01:09:02.029
We've got to escape!

01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:05.598
That's it.

01:09:21.225 --> 01:09:23.559
- This place is a labyrinth.

01:09:38.487 --> 01:09:39.487
- Not again!

01:09:40.346 --> 01:09:41.180
Damn it!

01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:59.542
Whoa!

01:10:07.896 --> 01:10:08.729
Miss.

01:10:46.692 --> 01:10:47.525
Hi.

01:10:50.073 --> 01:10:52.240
How did you get down here?

01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:00.760
- Are we interrupting something?

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.427
- No, all done here.

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:17.772
Look for the air vent.

01:12:17.772 --> 01:12:18.605
- Here.

01:12:21.490 --> 01:12:23.157
- I can see the sky.

01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:26.788
I can see the sky.

01:12:26.788 --> 01:12:29.611
Do you think I can do it?
- Are you sure?

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.142
- Yes.

01:12:31.142 --> 01:12:34.033
I'll let you know when I'm at the top.

01:12:34.033 --> 01:12:35.533
- Take this, then.

01:12:42.014 --> 01:12:44.324
We'll try to find John and Tiffany.

01:12:44.324 --> 01:12:47.157
- It's all clear, you guys can go!

01:13:17.406 --> 01:13:20.606
- This must be where it started.

01:13:40.136 --> 01:13:41.386
- I did it.

01:13:41.386 --> 01:13:43.596
I finally succeeded!

01:13:43.596 --> 01:13:45.956
Oh, don't be afraid.

01:13:45.956 --> 01:13:47.289
I'm your father.

01:13:49.455 --> 01:13:53.788
And you are the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

01:14:02.276 --> 01:14:06.026
You and me, we are going
to change the world.

01:14:38.654 --> 01:14:40.154
The spark of life.

01:14:46.654 --> 01:14:47.977
Stop.

01:14:47.977 --> 01:14:49.144
I command you.

01:14:52.217 --> 01:14:53.050
Stop!

01:14:55.185 --> 01:14:56.018
No, no!

01:14:57.217 --> 01:14:58.050
You can't!

01:14:59.326 --> 01:15:00.159
No!

01:15:07.127 --> 01:15:07.960
- Father.

01:15:22.717 --> 01:15:23.550
- Careful.

01:16:08.776 --> 01:16:13.776
Daniel.

01:16:16.716 --> 01:16:19.856
Why aren't they like the others?

01:16:19.856 --> 01:16:24.606
- Maybe you have to
get infected before you die.

01:16:54.698 --> 01:16:55.531
- Tiffany.

01:17:02.406 --> 01:17:03.656
Sorry, Tiffany.

01:17:43.106 --> 01:17:44.407
Got ya, bitch.

01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:05.823
- That isn't yours.

01:18:23.018 --> 01:18:25.338
Jennifer, Jennifer, are you there?

01:18:25.338 --> 01:18:28.239
- You're gonna bring more
of those things down on us.

01:18:52.835 --> 01:18:56.955
- How'd you get to be so bad-ass?

01:18:56.955 --> 01:18:59.122
- My little sister, Keena.

01:19:05.645 --> 01:19:07.544
The carnival came to town.

01:19:07.544 --> 01:19:12.544
Mom and Dad let us go on our
own 'cause I was responsible.

01:19:13.114 --> 01:19:18.114
I decided to walk, 'cause I
didn't wanna wait for the bus.

01:19:18.216 --> 01:19:19.549
A car pulled up.

01:19:21.714 --> 01:19:23.631
It was someone we knew.

01:19:24.484 --> 01:19:25.401
I got away.

01:19:27.224 --> 01:19:28.641
But Keena didn't.

01:19:29.976 --> 01:19:31.476
I still visit her.

01:19:32.874 --> 01:19:35.496
Praying for her to wake.

01:19:35.496 --> 01:19:38.565
I told myself I'd never
be that helpless again.

01:20:14.837 --> 01:20:15.670
- Aneesha!

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:25.340
- Daniel.

01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.311
- Jennifer, you made it!

01:20:27.311 --> 01:20:28.644
- Oh, thank god.

01:20:32.191 --> 01:20:33.024
Aneesha.

01:20:34.067 --> 01:20:35.150
- We made it.

01:20:39.666 --> 01:20:41.666
- Oh, my god.

01:20:51.946 --> 01:20:53.206
- Hurry, go!

01:20:53.206 --> 01:20:55.078
- No, we're not leaving you.

01:20:55.078 --> 01:20:56.226
- Go!

01:20:56.226 --> 01:20:59.965
Get out, get her out of
here, go save yourself!

01:20:59.965 --> 01:21:02.313
- Close it, close it, close it!

01:21:18.199 --> 01:21:19.518
- Daniel!

01:21:19.518 --> 01:21:20.601
Are you okay?

01:21:26.266 --> 01:21:28.415
Quick, we gotta go!

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:36.141
Oh, my god.

01:21:58.755 --> 01:22:00.672
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:22:02.786 --> 01:22:04.175
It's okay.

01:22:04.175 --> 01:22:06.306
Shh, it's alright.

01:22:06.306 --> 01:22:09.906
- Seems we have fallen
on hard times, my friend.

01:22:09.906 --> 01:22:12.266
- You can say that, mister.

01:22:12.266 --> 01:22:14.274
- Have you served?

01:22:14.274 --> 01:22:17.194
- Yes, sir, sounds like
you were on the other side.

01:22:17.194 --> 01:22:22.194
- But now we
are on the same side.

01:22:22.335 --> 01:22:24.826
Why don't you come with me
and have a proper dinner?

01:22:24.826 --> 01:22:26.076
Would you like that?

01:22:26.076 --> 01:22:29.276
- Well, that's mighty
kind of you, mister--

01:22:29.276 --> 01:22:31.859
- Baumgartner, Dr. Baumgartner.

01:22:45.946 --> 01:22:46.779
- No!

01:22:49.807 --> 01:22:50.807
- Screw you!

01:22:53.815 --> 01:22:54.982
- Wait.
- What?

01:22:56.887 --> 01:22:58.257
- Stop!

01:22:58.257 --> 01:22:59.090
Stop it!

01:23:01.036 --> 01:23:01.986
No!

01:23:28.272 --> 01:23:30.689
- You're hurt.
- Oh, I'm okay.

01:23:31.743 --> 01:23:32.576
Aneesha.

01:23:35.274 --> 01:23:36.882
- Where is he?

01:23:36.882 --> 01:23:37.715
- Who?

01:23:39.504 --> 01:23:40.337
Felix?

01:23:41.693 --> 01:23:43.553
- What is he doing here?

01:23:43.553 --> 01:23:44.823
- I'll find him.

01:23:53.645 --> 01:23:55.306
- Did you get it?

01:23:55.306 --> 01:23:56.473
Well, did you?

01:24:00.045 --> 01:24:01.462
- Yeah, I got it.

01:24:08.557 --> 01:24:11.890
Did you know those things were in there?

01:24:13.516 --> 01:24:15.056
You son of a bitch.

01:24:15.056 --> 01:24:17.146
- You seem to have managed.

01:24:17.146 --> 01:24:19.128
- My friends are dead!

01:24:19.128 --> 01:24:23.378
- And so will you be, if
you don't hand those over.

01:24:24.778 --> 01:24:26.111
Give them to me!

01:24:28.077 --> 01:24:29.098
Down!

01:24:29.098 --> 01:24:30.765
Put them down there.

01:24:32.826 --> 01:24:34.407
- What's going on?

01:24:34.407 --> 01:24:36.074
- Ah, right on time!

01:24:37.168 --> 01:24:38.751
Go to your friends.

01:24:40.386 --> 01:24:42.528
- What are you doing?

01:24:42.528 --> 01:24:44.938
That serum is for my
sister, we had a deal.

01:24:44.938 --> 01:24:47.677
- A deal, what kind of deal?
- Nothing.

01:24:47.677 --> 01:24:49.277
- You know each other?

01:24:49.277 --> 01:24:50.860
- Go on, tell them.

01:24:51.906 --> 01:24:55.237
She's been a very naughty girl.

01:24:55.237 --> 01:24:58.706
- You brought us in here on purpose!

01:24:58.706 --> 01:25:00.366
- No.

01:25:00.366 --> 01:25:01.536
Yes.

01:25:01.536 --> 01:25:04.026
To save my sister, but he lied.

01:25:04.026 --> 01:25:05.378
You lied.

01:25:05.378 --> 01:25:09.018
- Oh, well, when you say it like that.

01:25:09.018 --> 01:25:12.426
I had to be sure you'd go in, didn't I?

01:25:12.426 --> 01:25:14.946
And then I had to be sure you'd stay in,

01:25:14.946 --> 01:25:17.113
when you saw the monsters!

01:25:18.237 --> 01:25:20.726
- What the fuck is going on, Aneesha?

01:25:20.726 --> 01:25:22.946
- What does this have
to do with your sister?

01:25:22.946 --> 01:25:25.458
- I've been looking for a cure
for her all over the world.

01:25:25.458 --> 01:25:28.057
I found a guy in Bangkok who knew someone,

01:25:28.057 --> 01:25:31.498
who knew someone else, and
eventually, it led me to him!

01:25:31.498 --> 01:25:36.226
- Touching story, and I
thank you all very much.

01:25:36.226 --> 01:25:40.559
And now I have what I need
and your job is finished!

01:25:42.866 --> 01:25:43.957
- Stop!

01:26:05.594 --> 01:26:08.261
I just wanted to save my sister.

01:26:09.273 --> 01:26:10.523
Bring her back.

01:26:14.325 --> 01:26:18.042
Wouldn't you do the same
for John, if you could?

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:18.875
Hm?

01:26:41.641 --> 01:26:42.474
- Please.

01:26:46.933 --> 01:26:48.433
