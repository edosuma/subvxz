01:28.539 --> 01:30.748
Hey, Dad,
did you get stuck in traffic?

01:30.833 --> 01:33.918
How many times have I told you?
No biking on Sunset.

01:34.420 --> 01:36.337
You wanna be some
movie producer's roadkill?

01:36.964 --> 01:39.132
I bought you the Beemer for a reason.

01:39.216 --> 01:40.717
Okay, okay. I'll drive it.

01:41.969 --> 01:44.095
Up the 101 Freeway to UC Santa Barbara.

01:44.179 --> 01:45.179
Dana...

01:45.264 --> 01:47.223
Have you even looked at
the catalog I gave you?

01:47.558 --> 01:49.767
You're gonna study fish and surf all day?

01:49.852 --> 01:51.311
I can't even talk to you.

01:51.395 --> 01:53.896
Hey, you've got a free ride to a top school.

01:54.064 --> 01:55.857
You're going, case closed. Why?

01:55.941 --> 01:57.942
So I can score some high-paying job

01:58.027 --> 02:00.903
rotting behind some desk
all day to pay for all this?

02:02.573 --> 02:04.157
Okay, maybe "rotting" was a poor choice.

02:04.241 --> 02:05.366
I don't have time for this.

02:05.576 --> 02:07.243
You never have time.

02:07.328 --> 02:10.621
Dad, I appreciate you work hard,
I really do.

02:10.705 --> 02:12.957
But I would suffocate in that world.

02:13.042 --> 02:16.002
I'm like Mom,
I'm too much of a free spirit.

02:17.212 --> 02:19.088
Where did you get that, "free spirit"?

02:19.173 --> 02:20.757
It's from her journal, Dad.

02:22.259 --> 02:24.135
You should never have brought her to LA.

02:24.219 --> 02:26.137
This is what really killed her,
not the cancer.

02:27.431 --> 02:30.808
Dana, give me a break. You were five
years old, you barely knew her.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.214
High five.

03:02.966 --> 03:04.801
It's funny.

03:05.135 --> 03:07.553
Get that camera out of my face.

03:07.638 --> 03:09.055
Look at that, it's right over there.

03:16.814 --> 03:19.857
Come on, guys.
Come on, lunch is ready.

03:20.484 --> 03:21.734
Daddy,
can I try the camera?

03:21.819 --> 03:24.153
Dana, go get your bucket,
the waves are gonna get it.

03:25.239 --> 03:28.157
Go get your bucket out of the sea.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.413
This is fun.

03:41.672 --> 03:43.589
Look out,
that's a big wave.

03:50.180 --> 03:52.807
Come, let's build a sand castle.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.895
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.234
Last night I had a dream

04:03.318 --> 04:06.654
where I took my little Dana back
home to South Africa with me

04:06.864 --> 04:10.199
and showed her the Bay
of Plenty and Cave Rock,

04:10.617 --> 04:13.661
Vulamanzi Point and Banana Reef.

04:13.745 --> 04:17.999
All the way down the Wild Coast
to Coffee Bay and Bruce's.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.461
Finally we reached Jeffrey's Bay,

04:21.545 --> 04:25.715
the one place I've always dreamed of surfing.

04:27.176 --> 04:30.178
If only I could take her there.

04:30.262 --> 04:35.391
If only she could see these places,
maybe she could see me, too.

04:37.269 --> 04:39.270
But that can never happen now.

04:39.354 --> 04:41.397
I'm out of time.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.733
And I'm afraid I'll never get back home.

04:51.033 --> 04:53.659
Dad, by the time you get
back from your business trip,

04:53.744 --> 04:55.369
I'll be in South Africa.

04:55.871 --> 04:58.581
I think you and I could use some time apart.

04:58.749 --> 05:01.459
And I think it's time I
learned more about Mom.

05:02.085 --> 05:04.253
It's just something I have to do.

05:04.755 --> 05:09.592
Don't worry about me. I'll be
fine, as always. Love, Dana.

05:20.312 --> 05:22.730
First trip to South Africa?

05:22.814 --> 05:23.940
Yeah, it is.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.150
Visiting family?

05:26.235 --> 05:27.235
Um...

05:27.319 --> 05:28.402
Kind of.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.404
Well, enjoy.

05:30.489 --> 05:31.614
Thank you.

05:36.245 --> 05:37.745
Let me guess,

05:38.914 --> 05:42.208
California girl going south to find winter swell.

05:43.126 --> 05:44.168
Is it that obvious?

05:44.419 --> 05:47.004
Well, flight to Durban, surf city.

05:47.422 --> 05:49.799
Roxy sunglasses, ocean hair.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.093
How very CSI of you.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.845
Well, that and The Bomb.

05:55.138 --> 05:56.138
Ah!

05:56.890 --> 05:58.933
Well, every surfer gets it. Yeah.

05:59.643 --> 06:01.394
I'm Grant. Dana.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.145
Nice to meet you, California girl.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.190
Where you headed?

06:06.984 --> 06:08.693
I don't have a plan.

06:08.777 --> 06:10.236
Nice.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.320
A real beach bum.

06:11.530 --> 06:13.072
Yeah.

06:13.156 --> 06:15.324
Well, if you make it down south,
look me up.

06:15.784 --> 06:17.493
I'll buy you a smoothie at my bar.

06:18.161 --> 06:19.620
It's called Sally Can't Surf.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.456
Cool, thanks.

06:22.541 --> 06:23.666
Pleasure.

06:46.648 --> 06:48.399
Taxi? Taxi?

06:51.320 --> 06:52.570
Miss, where are you going?

06:52.654 --> 06:54.196
Where can I catch a bus to the beach?

06:54.281 --> 06:55.364
There are no buses today, miss.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.824
Hey! What are you doing?

06:57.075 --> 06:59.410
Special holiday. Have a good price.

06:59.494 --> 07:01.537
No problem, I'll give good price.

07:06.418 --> 07:07.710
Attention, passengers.

07:08.045 --> 07:11.464
This bus is leaving for Durban
City Beach in two minutes.

07:11.548 --> 07:12.757
Sorry.

07:18.680 --> 07:19.680
Move the bag.

07:19.765 --> 07:21.557
I'm sorry, this seat's taken.

07:21.725 --> 07:23.059
Yeah? Who takes it?

07:23.602 --> 07:24.894
Her.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.731
Hey, you're late. I saved you a seat.

07:46.416 --> 07:47.750
Pushy.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.752
I'll say. What a creep.

07:50.087 --> 07:52.421
I mean, my name is Pushy.

07:52.923 --> 07:53.923
Oh.

07:54.466 --> 07:57.426
That's unusual.
What does it mean in your language?

07:57.761 --> 07:59.762
Pushy. Like "pushy"?

07:59.971 --> 08:01.972
Actually, my Zulu name is Nokuthula.

08:02.057 --> 08:03.182
Which means...

08:03.433 --> 08:04.767
"Be quiet."

08:24.663 --> 08:25.746
What?

08:26.164 --> 08:29.667
Never seen a white girl riding the bus before.

08:29.751 --> 08:32.253
Well, I've never seen a black girl who surfs.

08:32.337 --> 08:33.546
Well, if you're lucky,

08:33.630 --> 08:36.506
maybe you'll get a chance to
observe it for the first time.

08:37.174 --> 08:38.634
Maybe you'll learn something.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.846
Well, if that particular
scenario presents itself,

08:42.889 --> 08:46.475
don't be surprised if I'm not
the one who gets schooled.

09:24.139 --> 09:25.514
That's New Pier.

09:26.057 --> 09:28.809
She throws killer sets almost every day.

09:31.021 --> 09:33.522
Best spot in the city.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.815
Let's do it.

09:41.907 --> 09:43.616
You cool? Yeah, I'll see you there.

10:02.260 --> 10:03.803
Looks decent.

10:03.887 --> 10:04.929
Decent?

10:05.430 --> 10:07.890
Better than Malibu, I bet.

10:08.725 --> 10:11.393
My advice to you is to sit wide,

10:11.812 --> 10:13.604
smile, wait for a wrap-around set

10:14.064 --> 10:17.483
and maybe you'll catch a little ride.

10:20.821 --> 10:21.946
Shit.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.239
What?

10:23.323 --> 10:25.491
Don't tell me you're afraid of 4-foot waves.

10:25.575 --> 10:29.328
No, it's not the waves, it's her. Tara.

10:37.879 --> 10:39.964
Wow, Tara can surf.

10:41.883 --> 10:44.510
So, what do we do, just jump in?

10:45.971 --> 10:48.514
Sometimes it's the only way.

11:19.921 --> 11:22.256
It's mobbed enough out here,
go surf South Beach.

11:23.967 --> 11:25.801
There's plenty of waves out here, Tara.

11:26.344 --> 11:29.972
Yeah, for me. Not you, or Barbie there.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.975
Hey, you stay out of my way
and I'll stay out of yours.

11:33.059 --> 11:35.978
Yeah? You better explain the
pecking order to her, Push.

11:36.354 --> 11:37.980
Hate to have to educate her the hard way.

11:44.988 --> 11:47.323
Let's go. I hate this aggro vibe.

11:47.490 --> 11:52.745
Hell, no. I just flew 23 hours in coach.
I'm surfing.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.131
Gidget alert. Coming through.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.551
You here for your surf
lesson?

12:07.636 --> 12:09.720
Hey, Baywatch, how you doing?

12:09.804 --> 12:12.431
Did your daddy buy
you an antique surf board?

12:39.459 --> 12:40.542
I got it.

12:42.003 --> 12:43.587
No, you don't.

13:31.428 --> 13:33.887
Wow. Yeah, it was a nice wave.

13:34.097 --> 13:37.850
No, I mean, whoa,
you stole one from the queen bee.

13:37.934 --> 13:39.852
Talk about getting schooled.

13:40.020 --> 13:43.147
Yeah, Tara needs to loosen her sphincter up.

13:43.231 --> 13:45.607
Let's go.

13:53.992 --> 13:56.285
Great.
Now every knob thinks they can surf.

14:01.916 --> 14:03.167
Outside!

14:05.336 --> 14:06.670
Out of the way, Barbie.

14:10.216 --> 14:11.300
Move!

14:11.760 --> 14:13.844
Hey, I said I had it. Hey!

14:14.971 --> 14:16.346
Shit!

14:36.159 --> 14:37.993
What do you think you were doing? Shit!

14:38.078 --> 14:40.370
You could have killed me! Get
out of the water, you idiot!

14:40.663 --> 14:41.997
You dropped in on her, Tara!

14:45.668 --> 14:46.627
Damn it!

14:46.711 --> 14:48.045
Why do you have to be such a...

14:48.129 --> 14:50.005
Such a what? God!

14:50.090 --> 14:52.424
That's right. Run away.

14:54.010 --> 14:55.677
And don't come back!

15:03.561 --> 15:05.062
Is that how it is in South Africa?

15:05.230 --> 15:06.563
Screw her.

15:06.648 --> 15:09.608
You snagged the barrel of the day
out there. Right in their faces.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.235
Yeah, but I busted my board!

15:11.444 --> 15:13.195
Better the board than your head.

15:13.863 --> 15:16.698
It was my mom's. I can't replace it.

15:22.330 --> 15:24.123
I can't believe it!

15:28.795 --> 15:31.713
No. No, no.

15:41.891 --> 15:43.725
This can't be happening.

15:47.647 --> 15:48.814
Shit.

15:48.898 --> 15:50.149
Your money?

15:50.233 --> 15:51.316
I don't care about that.

15:53.069 --> 15:54.570
My mother's carving's gone.

15:55.238 --> 15:57.531
Yeah. These lockers are pretty flimsy.

15:58.366 --> 15:59.992
Really?

16:04.497 --> 16:05.747
You know what? I'm sorry.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.916
Can you just leave me alone? Please?

16:31.232 --> 16:34.318
Dana, give me a break.
You barely knew her.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.451
Hi, I'd like to make a
collect call to the United States.

16:44.871 --> 16:49.082
Area code 31 0-467...

16:49.834 --> 16:52.502
You must be hungry.

16:52.962 --> 16:55.047
We're grilling a fish tonight.

17:00.136 --> 17:01.637
Hang up.

17:02.430 --> 17:05.473
Come on, give it one more chance.

17:11.606 --> 17:13.106
What kind of fish?

17:18.695 --> 17:22.241
My dad would freak if he saw me doing this.

17:22.325 --> 17:25.577
He would drag me home for sure.

17:25.662 --> 17:28.413
Well, if he knew where I was.

17:28.498 --> 17:30.749
Your dad doesn't know you're in Africa?

17:31.376 --> 17:34.253
Oh, man. You are in trouble, girl.

17:36.381 --> 17:41.301
No, I doubt that. I'm actually not
sure he even knows I'm gone.

17:41.552 --> 17:42.678
What?

17:47.350 --> 17:49.142
Thanks, man.

17:49.227 --> 17:50.769
Thank you. Cheers.

18:04.033 --> 18:06.451
This is where you live?

18:06.536 --> 18:07.577
Yes.

18:07.745 --> 18:09.746
And these people are my family.

18:09.831 --> 18:10.872
Hey, guys. WOMAN: Hi.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.209
This might be paradise.

18:14.294 --> 18:17.546
Wait a minute.
What the hell is she doing here?

18:17.630 --> 18:18.839
Uh...

18:18.923 --> 18:20.007
She lives here.

18:20.091 --> 18:21.133
What?

18:21.467 --> 18:26.388
She lives with you? All right, strike
"paradise," insert "hell."

18:26.806 --> 18:28.557
What is her deal anyway?

18:28.641 --> 18:31.393
For starters,
she's a professional athlete.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.645
She's the number one on the Roxy team,

18:33.730 --> 18:35.647
and she doesn't let anyone forget it.

18:35.732 --> 18:38.191
I thought I said something
about "don't come back."

18:38.443 --> 18:40.444
Yet here you are again,
like a bad memory.

18:40.528 --> 18:42.571
It's not just your house, Tara.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.699
No, but there's a pecking order,
just like the line-up.

18:45.783 --> 18:48.577
Yeah, well,
your pecking order doesn't work for me.

18:50.705 --> 18:52.748
Cops are back. You know what to do.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.875
Not again. We'll take this up later.

18:56.419 --> 18:58.086
Let's go!

19:12.101 --> 19:13.393
Come on.

19:15.813 --> 19:19.358
By order of the eThekwini
Metropolitan Municipality,

19:19.442 --> 19:21.610
this property is condemned

19:21.778 --> 19:24.029
and must be vacated immediately.

19:24.447 --> 19:25.572
Care to fill me in?

19:25.656 --> 19:26.907
They want us out of here.

19:27.575 --> 19:29.201
We're a nuisance.

19:30.453 --> 19:32.371
They really want to tear the place down.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.292
This is your final warning.

19:37.585 --> 19:40.212
This structure will be
demolished in one week.

19:42.173 --> 19:45.300
By order of the court,
this is your final warning.

19:51.182 --> 19:52.808
Piss balloons. Oh!

19:53.810 --> 19:54.976
Disgusting!

19:58.481 --> 20:01.983
This is your last warning. You
have one week to get out.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.822
Come on,
I'll introduce you to the family.

20:08.825 --> 20:10.826
We laid claim to this beach years ago.

20:11.327 --> 20:14.246
At first it was just a couple of
tents and some surf boards.

20:14.664 --> 20:17.165
Now it's a self-sustaining community.

20:17.250 --> 20:22.295
Really, it's just a bunch of friends who are
serious about goofing off and riding waves.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.172
I like your family.

20:24.340 --> 20:27.926
Best people in the world.
I met them all through Tim.

20:28.845 --> 20:29.886
Hey!

20:30.763 --> 20:31.763
Whoa!

20:32.765 --> 20:34.599
Speak of the devil.

20:34.684 --> 20:36.184
Timothy, say hi to Dana.

20:36.602 --> 20:37.936
Hey. Hi.

20:39.814 --> 20:40.772
You from LA?

20:40.857 --> 20:43.024
Yeah. I got in today.

20:43.317 --> 20:44.276
You staying?

20:44.360 --> 20:45.485
I don't know.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.612
That means you're staying.

20:47.697 --> 20:50.699
Okay, Pushy,
let's show her the best part.

20:56.497 --> 20:57.873
You all right?

20:58.040 --> 20:59.624
My humble abode.

21:01.043 --> 21:04.087
Cool. Does it run?

21:04.172 --> 21:06.798
If I have my way, it will. Someday.

21:09.051 --> 21:10.635
That's lots of elephants.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.180
Yeah, I volunteer at the nature reserve.

21:13.723 --> 21:17.017
In between being one of the
best board shapers around.

21:17.101 --> 21:20.896
And our go-to fix-it man.
Hence the mess.

21:21.689 --> 21:24.024
But I can move some of this stuff
if you need a place to stay.

21:24.108 --> 21:27.402
Nice try! She's staying with me.

21:29.363 --> 21:30.572
Come on.

21:43.669 --> 21:47.589
Careful, Dana, you've seen how we
deal with blow-ins around here.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.090
She's staying with me, Tara.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.928
Just stay out of my way.

21:53.554 --> 21:55.805
My pleasure.

21:59.310 --> 22:04.606
So, it's not the Hilton,
but it's not so bad.

22:07.818 --> 22:09.653
Yeah, I could hang with this for a while.

22:13.950 --> 22:14.950
Ha!

22:15.034 --> 22:18.954
I see Laura and Sally,
all the top Roxy riders,

22:20.331 --> 22:22.541
but I don't see Tara.

22:22.625 --> 22:24.626
I must have missed her somehow.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.044
Uh-huh.

22:26.128 --> 22:28.505
Girl has it made, hey?

22:28.589 --> 22:31.383
Travel the world,
surf killer waves all day,

22:31.467 --> 22:34.469
pose for the cameras and get paid for it.

22:34.762 --> 22:36.972
Why don't you try out for the team?
I did.

22:38.307 --> 22:39.558
Didn't make the cut.

22:39.642 --> 22:41.851
Why? You can rip, I saw you.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.646
Or... Or?

22:46.816 --> 22:49.317
Or Tara screwed me over.

22:50.319 --> 22:53.154
Wow. Well, I wouldn't put it past her.

22:53.281 --> 22:57.576
Yeah, one big, happy family.

22:57.660 --> 22:59.661
That's what we are.

23:02.039 --> 23:04.082
You jet-lagged?

23:04.166 --> 23:05.333
Maybe a little.

23:18.222 --> 23:19.639
Dana?

23:41.454 --> 23:42.537
Dana!

24:10.024 --> 24:12.359
Hey, sister!

24:13.486 --> 24:15.695
Okay, be cool.

24:15.780 --> 24:16.821
I am cool.

24:16.906 --> 24:18.865
No, be cool.

24:18.949 --> 24:19.991
Okay.

24:20.076 --> 24:22.077
Look, it's a zombie.

24:22.453 --> 24:24.579
Night of the living Dana.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.207
Food. Give me food.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.084
Voilà. Whoo!

24:31.379 --> 24:35.006
Oh, my God. That's, like,
the best fish I've ever had.

24:35.091 --> 24:37.175
Well, that's good, 'cause it's
the main course tomorrow.

24:37.259 --> 24:39.177
And the next night. And breakfast.

24:40.930 --> 24:42.430
Nice.

24:46.477 --> 24:48.645
Hey. Grant. Hey.

24:50.231 --> 24:51.981
Hey, Sugaree.

24:54.443 --> 24:55.735
I don't believe it.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.445
You know Grant?

24:57.530 --> 24:59.364
I met him on the plane, briefly.

25:00.825 --> 25:02.701
Fifty bucks says he was flying first class.

25:02.785 --> 25:03.910
How do you know?

25:04.578 --> 25:06.705
Grant's the only one that
can afford a truck like that.

25:07.957 --> 25:09.290
I wish I had one.

25:09.625 --> 25:12.127
Trust me,
you don't want to get mixed up in that.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.838
Come on,
I'll show you the giant sea turtles.

25:14.922 --> 25:16.631
They lay their eggs just up the beach.

25:16.882 --> 25:18.133
California girl!

25:19.760 --> 25:21.720
I had a feeling you'd show up before long.

25:21.804 --> 25:23.138
Small world, huh?

25:23.347 --> 25:25.640
Yeah. Pushy brought me here.

25:26.642 --> 25:27.892
Oh, Pushy.

25:30.146 --> 25:31.563
Bro.

25:31.939 --> 25:33.189
I owe you one. I do, I do.

25:34.525 --> 25:37.026
So, California girl, are you gonna
show us what you got?

25:38.154 --> 25:39.946
I don't know. Come on.

25:40.364 --> 25:42.198
You feel the groove.

25:44.118 --> 25:45.577
Come on. Come on.

25:47.037 --> 25:48.705
Can you hold this?

25:55.796 --> 25:59.841
"Let me show you the giant sea turtles"?
Seriously?

26:00.217 --> 26:01.301
Shut up.

26:19.945 --> 26:21.946
California girl can dance.

27:33.936 --> 27:35.603
Pushy?

28:10.556 --> 28:12.140
See ya.

28:25.696 --> 28:27.572
Morning, California girl!

28:27.865 --> 28:28.990
Hey.

28:29.617 --> 28:30.658
Jet-lagged?

28:30.743 --> 28:31.784
I'm here, aren't I?

28:36.874 --> 28:40.126
Can't believe those two are friends.
They seem so different.

28:40.961 --> 28:43.588
The love of the ocean brings
different spirits together.

28:45.090 --> 28:48.009
I think they might both
love something else, too.

28:49.053 --> 28:50.470
I'm not going there.

28:50.554 --> 28:51.721
Oh, yeah?

28:51.805 --> 28:54.098
Think I might have seen
your lips go there last night.

28:55.392 --> 28:58.436
Maybe a little tongue, too. Right.

29:00.397 --> 29:04.067
Go ahead, girl. You got this.
Show 'em what you got.

29:04.151 --> 29:06.486
I'm all over it.

29:09.031 --> 29:11.491
Go for it, California girl!

29:15.204 --> 29:17.038
Whoo!

29:17.122 --> 29:18.831
Go, girl!

29:28.884 --> 29:30.969
Keep up, old man. I'm trying!

29:42.022 --> 29:44.941
Go get 'em, Tim.

30:15.973 --> 30:18.141
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

30:27.109 --> 30:28.651
Yeah!

31:15.449 --> 31:16.449
Whoo!

31:31.048 --> 31:32.840
You don't remember her at all?

31:35.594 --> 31:39.263
Just a few blurry images.
You know, like in a dream.

31:39.348 --> 31:41.516
Her name was Catherine.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.893
I was five years old.

31:43.977 --> 31:45.019
Those are all you have left?

31:45.562 --> 31:49.857
And there was another keepsake of hers,
but it got stolen with my stuff.

31:50.859 --> 31:53.111
She always wanted to
show me her homeland.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.948
Your mom was a hottie!

31:59.201 --> 32:00.868
Well, like mother like daughter.

32:04.498 --> 32:05.498
Oh!

32:05.582 --> 32:08.376
Yes. Check it, bro.

32:09.211 --> 32:12.296
Classic Supertubes. And not a soul out.

32:13.215 --> 32:15.424
When was the last time
you saw J-bay like that?

32:15.884 --> 32:17.260
Never. Never.

32:17.344 --> 32:19.345
She wrote about Jeffrey's
Bay a lot in her journal.

32:19.555 --> 32:20.888
Like it was someplace sacred.

32:21.181 --> 32:24.559
Sacred's the word.
Finest point break in the world.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.478
My old stomping grounds.

32:27.563 --> 32:29.814
Oh! When J-bay fires on all cylinders...

32:30.190 --> 32:31.983
And the tubes are grinding
from the Boneyards,

32:32.067 --> 32:34.110
through Impossibles
right down to The Point...

32:34.486 --> 32:36.320
The holy grail of right-handers.

32:36.405 --> 32:37.446
The holy grail.

32:37.614 --> 32:40.241
She said it was the one place that
she had to surf before she died.

32:40.534 --> 32:41.742
But she never did.

32:42.870 --> 32:44.495
Probably couldn't.

32:45.455 --> 32:46.747
But I will.

32:46.832 --> 32:48.249
I'm gonna surf it for her.

32:49.126 --> 32:50.168
You know what else?

32:50.294 --> 32:53.254
I'm going to go to every one of
those places in those photos.

32:54.423 --> 32:57.592
Do you know what, Dana?
You're on Uhambo.

32:58.343 --> 33:00.428
That's what we call it in South Africa.

33:00.596 --> 33:03.014
It's like when someone's looking for...

33:04.600 --> 33:05.600
What?

33:06.226 --> 33:08.853
I don't know. My mom, I guess.

33:09.438 --> 33:11.105
Or maybe yourself.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.274
In Australia they call it a walkabout.

33:13.734 --> 33:15.526
In the Holy Land, a pilgrimage.

33:15.611 --> 33:17.778
What do you call it in America?

33:18.197 --> 33:19.864
Um...

33:19.948 --> 33:22.074
A journey? Boring.

33:22.159 --> 33:23.659
Don't like it. Don't like it.

33:26.622 --> 33:27.747
An odyssey?

33:28.707 --> 33:29.832
I like that.

33:30.292 --> 33:32.043
An odyssey.

33:32.127 --> 33:34.420
I call it a pipe dream.

33:37.049 --> 33:39.592
You think it's still Endless Summer out there?

33:39.676 --> 33:42.470
It's a long, hard trip down the Wild
Coast before you get to J-bay.

33:43.347 --> 33:45.473
Not to mention winter's coming.
Do you even have a wetsuit?

33:46.558 --> 33:48.476
Then it's sharks in the ocean,

33:48.727 --> 33:52.271
locals who demand total respect,
and a heavy, heavy wave.

33:53.357 --> 33:55.650
Beverly Hills girl here wouldn't
last a day on her own.

33:55.984 --> 33:57.985
Who says she's on her own, Tara?

33:59.863 --> 34:03.991
Dana, you and I are going
on this odyssey together.

34:04.117 --> 34:06.535
That's good,
the blind leading the blind.

34:08.330 --> 34:09.496
I say they pull it off.

34:10.290 --> 34:13.125
Hundred bucks says they don't.
And I want evidence.

34:13.585 --> 34:16.003
Pictures of you at all those places.
And surfing them.

34:16.838 --> 34:18.297
Of course. You're on.

34:18.382 --> 34:19.465
She'll never surf J-bay.

34:20.676 --> 34:22.009
I could lend you my truck.

34:23.011 --> 34:24.094
Really?

34:24.179 --> 34:27.181
At a price. You ever waited tables?

34:28.725 --> 34:30.016
One of my waiters just quit.

34:30.686 --> 34:33.353
Maybe Pushy can show you the ropes here.

34:35.732 --> 34:37.858
Sound good? Sounds good.

34:39.194 --> 34:40.194
All right.

34:44.992 --> 34:46.534
Spare set.

34:48.578 --> 34:50.830
Always be prepared.

34:50.914 --> 34:52.540
It's a Land Rover.

34:52.623 --> 34:54.750
You drive it hard, you put it away wet.

34:54.835 --> 34:56.210
We can do that.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.554
Thanks, Grant. You sure you
don't want to come with us?

35:07.848 --> 35:12.059
Nah. We can go for a spin later,
perhaps, when you get back.

35:12.978 --> 35:15.313
Midnight, maybe. Just you and me.

35:15.397 --> 35:16.897
You're not that lucky.

35:19.985 --> 35:22.028
Here you go.
Document your odyssey properly.

35:22.362 --> 35:24.780
Tim, where did you find a Polaroid camera?

35:24.990 --> 35:27.241
Junk shop in Durban.
Dug up some film as well.

35:29.244 --> 35:31.704
That is so sweet of you.

35:31.788 --> 35:33.789
I got one more thing.

35:43.383 --> 35:45.384
Tim, this is amazing.

35:45.927 --> 35:48.929
Do you know how few people
can fix a board like this?

35:51.808 --> 35:53.184
Aw!

35:53.268 --> 35:56.479
You fixed her board, dude,
and you just got cheek.

36:00.025 --> 36:01.108
Be careful.

36:01.443 --> 36:02.902
Tara may be half-joking,

36:02.986 --> 36:05.196
but there's a lot of bad things
that can happen out there.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.781
You have a long highway ahead of you.

36:07.532 --> 36:10.534
Life is a highway

36:10.619 --> 36:12.036
Thank you.

36:13.580 --> 36:16.999
I wanna ride it All night long

36:26.593 --> 36:29.053
Life is a highway

36:29.137 --> 36:32.890
I wanna ride it all night long

36:33.683 --> 36:35.309
Yeah!

36:35.644 --> 36:38.396
If you're goin' my way

36:38.480 --> 36:41.982
I wanna drive it all night long

36:49.366 --> 36:54.245
"And I reached it just as dawn broke,
my favorite time of the day.

36:55.455 --> 36:58.916
"Difficult to find,
almost impossible to leave."

37:01.962 --> 37:03.629
That is some poetic shit.

37:04.089 --> 37:05.923
I mean, that's deep.

37:06.007 --> 37:07.091
Think so?

37:09.469 --> 37:12.596
Sounds like she was a first-rate mom.

37:12.681 --> 37:13.764
She was.

37:15.809 --> 37:18.227
At least I think she was.

37:18.353 --> 37:20.729
I mean, I know she was a free spirit.

37:23.942 --> 37:27.528
Shit, all I know is what's in that book.

37:29.030 --> 37:33.367
In the memorable words of my
dad, "I barely even knew her."

37:33.702 --> 37:35.911
You know, I bet you are a lot like her.

37:36.371 --> 37:38.289
I hope so.

37:39.666 --> 37:42.460
I live every day with the
fear that I'll never know.

37:46.882 --> 37:49.175
Yes. I can see it.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.094
See what?

37:54.556 --> 37:55.681
There it is!

38:01.396 --> 38:02.813
It's a Land Rover.

38:03.356 --> 38:06.525
Like Grant said,
you drive it hard and put it away wet.

38:06.610 --> 38:07.610
Whoo!

38:08.612 --> 38:09.737
Yeah!

38:22.792 --> 38:23.918
Hello.

38:24.586 --> 38:26.754
Well, that was rude.

39:56.761 --> 39:59.471
Looks pretty free-spirited to me.

40:15.614 --> 40:17.573
Yeah.

40:23.163 --> 40:27.374
Dana and Pushy's odyssey,
step one, complete.

40:29.836 --> 40:31.420
Put it away wet.

40:38.345 --> 40:40.512
Hey, man, put it away wet.

40:45.852 --> 40:46.977
Hole in the Wall.

40:47.062 --> 40:48.270
Done.

40:48.396 --> 40:50.314
Cha-ching, baby.

40:50.398 --> 40:51.899
Don't count your pennies just yet.

41:00.325 --> 41:03.911
The rule around here is the
new girl cleans the toilet.

41:04.412 --> 41:05.788
Oh, come on.

41:05.872 --> 41:07.623
Relax, it's not so bad.

41:07.707 --> 41:11.251
Except when some oke barks the dog
after too many klippies and coke.

41:12.045 --> 41:13.921
A what? You know, parks a tiger.

41:14.673 --> 41:15.673
Blows chunks.

41:15.757 --> 41:17.675
Oh! Gross.

41:18.593 --> 41:19.677
And by the way,

41:19.761 --> 41:22.763
just in case you were wondering
what's in this odyssey for me...

41:23.473 --> 41:25.015
I was waiting for this.

41:25.100 --> 41:28.227
In exchange for being your trusty guide,

41:28.311 --> 41:31.980
you will teach me how to
pull off your 360 floater.

41:32.607 --> 41:34.233
You're gonna try out for
the Roxy team again?

41:34.984 --> 41:36.944
You are not the only girl on a mission.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.782
Hell, yeah. Here.

41:43.159 --> 41:45.953
This is Spike from
Wakescape with your swell update.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.872
That frothy low that's been
spinning off Antarctica

41:48.957 --> 41:51.458
has intensified over the last 24 hours.

41:51.751 --> 41:53.419
If it keeps spinning like that,

41:53.503 --> 41:55.254
we're due for a macking
southerly groundswell

41:55.338 --> 41:58.882
to hit the East Coast, so you guys
in J-bay better start waxing up.

41:59.300 --> 42:01.093
And now back to music...
You hear that, Flash?

42:01.219 --> 42:04.430
J-bay
is gonna be all time, bro.

42:04.931 --> 42:06.306
Screwdriver.

42:06.933 --> 42:10.310
Thank you. Fix the radio, man?

42:26.286 --> 42:30.330
Walk this way. Straight. On foot only.

42:30.582 --> 42:31.915
Thank you.

42:51.519 --> 42:53.937
Long way in, hey?

42:57.025 --> 42:58.734
Uh... Pushy?

43:05.575 --> 43:08.202
I guess we should step aside.

43:08.286 --> 43:09.787
Yeah, seems wise.

43:29.432 --> 43:32.643
Your mom went to some
pretty far-out places.

43:32.727 --> 43:34.895
Yeah, like Beverly Hills.

43:40.068 --> 43:44.321
You know,
maybe that old guy was yanking our chain.

43:46.407 --> 43:50.202
Or maybe he wasn't.

43:52.455 --> 43:55.332
This is why surfers invent words.

43:55.416 --> 43:56.500
Invent words?

43:57.001 --> 43:59.461
You know, like "gnarly" or "stoked."

43:59.546 --> 44:00.546
Huh!

44:00.922 --> 44:03.799
So, what do we do, just jump in?

44:04.509 --> 44:06.218
Sure, you go first.

44:19.148 --> 44:22.776
Okay, the aerial 360.
Watch and learn.

44:39.210 --> 44:41.128
Go for it, Push! Come on!

44:47.385 --> 44:49.303
You're good. Try again!

45:03.276 --> 45:06.486
Look, because you ride goofy
you have to nail this on your backhand.

45:07.155 --> 45:09.072
It's a lot harder, Push.

45:09.157 --> 45:10.490
No kidding.

45:11.034 --> 45:13.035
You're gonna go down, round and up.

46:13.262 --> 46:15.472
From the flight deck
this is Captain Glen Ross.

46:15.682 --> 46:18.183
We're beginning our final
descent into Durban.

46:18.267 --> 46:19.643
Please fasten your seat belts,

46:19.727 --> 46:21.728
we'll be landing in 10 minutes.

46:26.317 --> 46:28.944
Mango smoothie, easy on the ice, Push.

46:34.158 --> 46:36.201
Look. Dana, I think we just
got off on the wrong foot.

46:36.285 --> 46:37.369
Mmm-hmm.

46:37.453 --> 46:38.912
'Cause believe it or not,
I'm kind of rooting for you.

46:39.372 --> 46:41.957
What, like you were rooting for
Pushy to join the Roxy team?

46:42.917 --> 46:44.209
She told you I sabotaged her?

46:45.795 --> 46:48.296
Yeah, that's bullshit. The truth is,
she surfed like crap.

46:49.924 --> 46:52.342
I was there.
She was out of shape and unprepared.

46:53.761 --> 46:56.221
Come on, you know it takes hard work
and commitment to be on a team.

46:56.305 --> 46:58.223
Some people have it,
some people don't.

46:59.100 --> 47:02.060
I think you might have it, Dana. Might.

47:03.021 --> 47:05.147
There's an open tryout in
Jeffrey's Bay next Saturday.

47:05.231 --> 47:06.523
And since you're headed that way anyway...

47:06.607 --> 47:08.525
Yeah, it's not my scene, Tara.

47:08.609 --> 47:09.693
But Pushy will be there.

47:12.822 --> 47:15.323
Sweet. So will I. Good.

47:17.493 --> 47:19.745
That's for you, Push.
Don't work too hard.

47:24.917 --> 47:26.877
Even if I do make it to J-bay,

47:26.961 --> 47:28.545
she'll never let me make the team.

47:28.629 --> 47:31.214
Well, maybe that decision's
up to you and not her.

47:50.651 --> 47:52.152
What?

48:06.334 --> 48:07.459
Hey.

48:07.543 --> 48:09.044
Who was that? Who?

48:10.171 --> 48:12.214
The guy in the truck.

48:12.298 --> 48:16.968
Just some oke asking about the surf here.
He didn't even have a stick.

48:17.053 --> 48:18.303
So, you don't know him?

48:18.387 --> 48:20.555
Nah. Never seen him before.

48:22.475 --> 48:23.475
Mmm.

48:26.771 --> 48:28.355
Pushy,

48:29.690 --> 48:31.983
I think I just saw the guy who stole my stuff.

48:32.860 --> 48:35.737
What? You sure?
You only saw him once.

48:36.364 --> 48:40.283
Pushy, I need to get my mom's stuff back.

48:40.493 --> 48:43.453
What's so important about this stuff anyway?

48:43.538 --> 48:45.122
I mean,
I know it was your mom's, but...

48:45.206 --> 48:48.208
It just... It just is.

48:51.003 --> 48:54.047
Tell you what. Shift's almost over.

48:54.132 --> 48:56.466
Go home. I'll cover for you.

48:57.176 --> 48:58.635
Thanks, Push.

49:00.304 --> 49:02.139
Tim.

49:02.223 --> 49:03.265
Hey.

49:03.808 --> 49:05.976
How's the odyssey coming? It's coming.

49:06.060 --> 49:08.019
Yeah? Yeah.
I'm just waiting on the water now.

49:08.104 --> 49:10.313
Yeah, I'm tracking that for you.

49:10.398 --> 49:12.607
You still got a couple of days
before the big swell comes.

49:13.401 --> 49:14.776
Thanks. No problem.

49:16.195 --> 49:19.698
What?

49:20.241 --> 49:22.284
Is it me,
or do you smell like an elephant?

49:22.368 --> 49:24.744
Hey! Elephants don't smell.

49:25.538 --> 49:28.206
That's pure man-sweat you're taking in.

49:30.209 --> 49:32.419
So, you had a long day at the reserve,
I smell.

49:32.879 --> 49:34.379
Long but good.

49:34.463 --> 49:36.173
You wanna see some pictures
while I get cleaned up?

49:36.257 --> 49:37.340
Sure. Yeah?

49:45.266 --> 49:47.309
See the way they
take care of one another?

49:47.393 --> 49:49.936
Looking after the old ones,
sick ones, young ones.

49:50.271 --> 49:52.898
I heard they even mourn
when one of them dies.

49:53.232 --> 49:56.276
Yeah, yeah, I've seen that.
Unfortunately.

49:56.819 --> 49:58.570
You lost one?

49:58.654 --> 50:02.240
Rare, but we do have some
poachers around here.

50:03.367 --> 50:04.409
Shit.

50:04.493 --> 50:05.660
Gotta hand it to 'em, though.

50:05.953 --> 50:09.497
After they mourn they just close ranks,

50:09.957 --> 50:12.250
the family reorders itself
and they just move on.

50:13.878 --> 50:15.003
Is that why you're drawn to them?

50:15.588 --> 50:16.880
What do you mean?

50:16.964 --> 50:19.716
You know, the family thing.

50:19.967 --> 50:23.428
Kind of like what you've created here.

50:25.431 --> 50:26.431
Huh.

50:28.226 --> 50:30.560
Well, aren't you a smart girl.

50:30.645 --> 50:31.978
Mmm.

50:32.063 --> 50:34.147
Not so smart.

50:35.149 --> 50:38.026
I'm probably the last person
you should be listening to.

50:39.695 --> 50:42.030
Hey, where are you going?

50:42.365 --> 50:44.115
You're not the only one that has to shower.

50:44.200 --> 50:46.076
Got a hot date tonight.

50:46.160 --> 50:49.120
I'm going dancing with Pushy.

50:51.207 --> 50:53.375
Hey, let me know about that swell.

51:04.553 --> 51:06.596
First time in Durban, sir?

51:06.681 --> 51:09.474
Well, first time in about 20 years.

51:31.914 --> 51:33.164
Hey, sister.

51:33.249 --> 51:34.374
Hi.

51:34.709 --> 51:37.294
This is it. This is where I grew up.

51:37.378 --> 51:40.463
And it's the best spot for
kwaito music and dancing.

52:08.159 --> 52:09.409
Careful, sister.

52:09.702 --> 52:12.287
Come on.
You never seen a white girl dance before?

52:12.913 --> 52:16.166
I'm teaching you my moves,
show me some of yours.

52:19.086 --> 52:21.796
Okay, then. Watch how it's done.

52:25.426 --> 52:26.968
Go, sister!

52:49.367 --> 52:52.619
Hello, everyone. Let's kick it
in here all night. You're ready?

53:36.831 --> 53:39.833
Why are you here? What the hell
do you want in my business?

53:40.084 --> 53:41.167
Huh?

53:43.712 --> 53:47.507
You keep looking for trouble, I will
show it to you. Do you hear me?

53:50.636 --> 53:52.637
Dana! Shit, that was him!

53:53.889 --> 53:55.223
We have to call the cops.

53:55.433 --> 53:59.394
Cops don't come to the kasie!
Dana. Dana!

54:00.146 --> 54:01.354
This is insane.

54:05.192 --> 54:08.611
Dana. This is not worth it,
whatever it is.

54:09.029 --> 54:10.447
I just wanna see where he goes,

54:10.531 --> 54:12.824
and we can come back later for help.

54:12.908 --> 54:14.409
Come on.

54:24.712 --> 54:25.962
Dana. What?

54:26.046 --> 54:27.755
You don't know what you're dealing with.

54:27.840 --> 54:29.924
We have to get out of here. Shh!

54:38.350 --> 54:40.977
Pushy.
That's Grant's truck.

54:41.061 --> 54:43.480
Grant's never been anywhere
near this part of town.

54:43.731 --> 54:45.648
Now, let's go. Please.

54:45.733 --> 54:47.734
Pushy, look.

54:53.699 --> 54:55.366
Come on.

55:12.885 --> 55:14.552
Always be prepared, right?

55:18.349 --> 55:20.600
Come on.

55:32.613 --> 55:34.697
Oh, my God! Pushy.

55:34.782 --> 55:36.491
Look. He's coming.

55:36.575 --> 55:38.618
Let's go. Run!

55:38.911 --> 55:40.662
Hey! Get them!

55:40.746 --> 55:41.871
Get them!

55:41.956 --> 55:44.207
Come on, come on.

55:44.291 --> 55:46.709
Go, go. Go!

55:50.756 --> 55:52.882
If we make it through this,
I'm gonna kill you.

55:52.967 --> 55:54.551
Leave us alone!

56:01.809 --> 56:03.726
Look out!

56:06.272 --> 56:07.981
Come on, go!

56:13.028 --> 56:14.487
Jump! Jump!

56:21.579 --> 56:24.080
Well, you happy now?

56:24.164 --> 56:25.623
"Happy"? What do you mean?

56:25.874 --> 56:27.917
You know, I have to live around here!

56:28.002 --> 56:30.420
You might wanna think
about that once in a while!

56:30.504 --> 56:33.506
This is getting out of control, Dana.

56:50.232 --> 56:52.525
Hey, come and get it. It's firing.

56:53.485 --> 56:54.944
Where were you last night?

56:55.070 --> 56:56.571
What?

56:57.698 --> 56:59.282
Out with a couple of mates having a few.

57:00.200 --> 57:01.242
What are you, my wife?

57:02.328 --> 57:05.705
Funny, 'cause I saw your
truck in the Umlazi township.

57:06.415 --> 57:09.208
Umlazi? Why would I go there?

57:09.543 --> 57:11.961
We saw your license plate, Grant.

57:12.046 --> 57:14.422
We also saw what was inside of your truck.

57:15.132 --> 57:17.258
I reported it to the police.

57:25.893 --> 57:28.895
Used to have a term for kooks

57:29.647 --> 57:32.899
who got in way over their heads
on a big day at Supers,

57:34.985 --> 57:36.235
shark bait.

57:41.367 --> 57:42.450
I think I'll take this one in.

57:45.079 --> 57:46.204
Yeah, you do that.

57:55.047 --> 57:57.256
You didn't call the cops.

57:57.341 --> 57:59.926
I bluffed. And he didn't fold.

58:00.427 --> 58:02.679
I'm not done with this.

58:15.442 --> 58:18.486
She's 18. She's my daughter.
I need to find her.

58:18.946 --> 58:20.446
Sir, she's an adult.

58:20.531 --> 58:24.075
We can put her photo in our database
and put out a missing persons alert,

58:24.159 --> 58:26.619
but I'm afraid there's not
much else we can do.

58:26.912 --> 58:27.870
Next.

58:27.955 --> 58:29.789
Look, how do I access the database?

58:31.750 --> 58:33.292
Next.

58:36.547 --> 58:41.300
I can't believe I let that creep con
me into actually liking him.

58:41.385 --> 58:43.970
A guy so opposite to everything I believe in!

58:46.974 --> 58:48.182
What's so funny?

58:49.143 --> 58:51.144
You're not that different from Grant.

58:51.478 --> 58:53.980
What? What's that supposed to mean?

58:56.233 --> 58:59.485
He's got a rich daddy.
You've got a rich daddy.

59:00.237 --> 59:04.532
Face it, you're both just spoiled kids
playing at being surf bums for a while.

59:05.075 --> 59:06.993
And making trouble for the rest of us.

59:07.077 --> 59:08.953
Where the hell is this coming from?

59:09.329 --> 59:12.999
You think because my father's rich
that I don't care about things?

59:13.083 --> 59:15.042
That I don't feel pain?

59:15.127 --> 59:16.919
You care about what's important to you.

59:17.254 --> 59:18.880
What? You're dangerous.

59:19.173 --> 59:21.007
And everyone else gets
dragged along for the ride.

59:21.091 --> 59:23.259
Hey, you volunteered for this ride, remember?

59:23.677 --> 59:26.179
Yeah, well,
maybe I'm getting off your bus.

59:26.638 --> 59:29.557
I'm sick and tired of living
someone else's dream.

59:29.850 --> 59:31.350
This is your dream, too!

59:31.685 --> 59:35.271
Right. And we both know Tara
is not gonna let that happen.

59:38.567 --> 59:43.112
You're giving up?

59:43.614 --> 59:45.656
Just leave me alone, Dana.

59:51.455 --> 59:54.499
You know what?
Maybe Tara was right about you!

59:55.375 --> 59:57.543
No commitment and no guts!

59:57.795 --> 01:00:00.046
Yeah? Thanks.

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.214
No problem.

01:00:52.891 --> 01:00:54.350
Grant!

01:01:26.967 --> 01:01:28.301
Hey, Dana. Hey.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.306
Well, I guess I need a place to stay.
Just for one night.

01:01:33.473 --> 01:01:35.099
I'm headed to J-bay tomorrow.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.565
You can stay in our room.

01:01:42.649 --> 01:01:44.025
Yeah, the more the merrier.

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:47.153
Look,
I think it's your lucky day.

01:01:47.321 --> 01:01:50.197
This cowpoke was gonna bunk with
Flash and Pete over in Tim's bus.

01:01:50.824 --> 01:01:54.327
Seems like a good opportunity for you to,
you know, do some thinkin' up in my room.

01:01:55.162 --> 01:01:56.203
Thanks, Cowboy.

01:01:56.288 --> 01:01:58.039
Come on. I'll help you get set up.

01:01:59.124 --> 01:02:00.166
Thanks, guys.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:01.250
Have a good night. Nice dreams.

01:02:01.919 --> 01:02:03.044
Sorry, boys.

01:02:03.128 --> 01:02:05.254
Hey, if you change your mind,
I've got condoms.

01:02:05.339 --> 01:02:06.881
You know, Tim says swell's comin'.

01:02:06.965 --> 01:02:08.799
Yeah, I guess.

01:02:08.884 --> 01:02:11.552
Shit, right in time for the Roxy tryouts.

01:02:11.637 --> 01:02:13.888
I wonder if Tara's really gonna be there.

01:02:13.972 --> 01:02:17.183
Yeah, I heard she left
earlier today with Grant,

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:19.435
so I reckon you ought to
plan on her being there.

01:02:19.519 --> 01:02:22.146
She left with Grant? After all that?

01:02:22.981 --> 01:02:25.024
I don't think she knows.

01:02:26.151 --> 01:02:28.194
I mean,
does any of us really know what happened?

01:02:31.865 --> 01:02:34.283
Thanks for letting me use your place.

01:02:34.368 --> 01:02:35.451
You got it.

01:02:42.668 --> 01:02:45.252
Dana! Dana!

01:02:50.217 --> 01:02:54.387
I'm out of time and I'm afraid
I'll never get back home.

01:02:54.930 --> 01:03:01.602
Dana. Dana?
Dana, where are you? Dana!

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:25.626
Pushy. Everybody, get up!

01:03:31.258 --> 01:03:32.425
Get up!

01:03:34.428 --> 01:03:35.845
Everybody, get up!

01:03:39.725 --> 01:03:40.766
Pushy!

01:03:44.312 --> 01:03:46.772
Everybody away from the house now!

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:53.863
Pushy!

01:03:53.947 --> 01:03:57.324
The eThekwini Municipality,
by the order of the court,

01:03:57.409 --> 01:04:01.245
is hereby demolishing
this condemned building.

01:04:01.329 --> 01:04:05.458
Any occupants are hereby advised
to vacate immediately.

01:04:10.464 --> 01:04:11.464
Pushy!

01:04:18.805 --> 01:04:20.806
Pushy! Shit.

01:04:27.481 --> 01:04:28.647
Pushy!

01:04:32.861 --> 01:04:35.071
Damn it. Pushy!

01:04:35.155 --> 01:04:37.823
Everybody move to open
sand for a head count. Go!

01:04:39.326 --> 01:04:40.993
Go. Come on, let's go.

01:04:42.662 --> 01:04:44.789
Pushy! Dana, I'm here.

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:46.582
I was looking for you.

01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:55.758
Go! Run! Come on!

01:04:55.842 --> 01:04:58.803
Pushy! Dana! Come on! Come on!

01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:10.689
Holy shit! There goes our home.

01:05:15.362 --> 01:05:18.781
Wait a minute. Tim. Where's Tim?

01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:22.660
Tim! ALL: Tim!

01:05:26.456 --> 01:05:29.375
No way, that thing runs!

01:05:36.258 --> 01:05:40.094
Attention. Unofficial vehicles are
not allowed on the beach.

01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:12.084
All aboard. Who's coming aboard?

01:06:14.754 --> 01:06:17.423
Bus leaves in five minutes!
- Where to?

01:06:17.757 --> 01:06:22.094
Jeffrey's Bay. It's confirmed, swell
of the decade is on its way.

01:06:27.434 --> 01:06:28.976
Let's go to J-bay.

01:06:35.817 --> 01:06:37.484
Thanks for coming after me.

01:06:38.486 --> 01:06:40.237
So, you going?

01:06:40.447 --> 01:06:43.032
You? Only if you go.

01:06:45.118 --> 01:06:47.036
You never give up, do you?

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.162
Nope.

01:06:49.331 --> 01:06:50.789
Then hell, yeah, I'm going.

01:06:51.791 --> 01:06:53.709
It's time you finished your damn odyssey.

01:06:53.877 --> 01:06:58.130
You and me, we've got an appointment
with destiny in J-bay.

01:06:58.215 --> 01:06:59.298
Hell, yeah, we do!

01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:15.898
Look after yourselves, okay?

01:07:23.198 --> 01:07:24.531
Get on the bus, man!

01:07:40.674 --> 01:07:41.882
No way.

01:07:43.009 --> 01:07:44.635
You saved it all?

01:07:44.719 --> 01:07:45.761
Hell, yeah.

01:07:47.889 --> 01:07:50.516
Tim! Hey, hey.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.186
I'm driving. Come on.

01:08:00.026 --> 01:08:01.652
Thank you.

01:08:54.372 --> 01:08:56.415
Come on! Dana, Pushy, run!
- Get on the bus!

01:08:56.916 --> 01:08:58.334
Come on! MAN 2: Move it!

01:10:20.333 --> 01:10:23.293
Hello. I'm looking for my daughter.

01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:25.003
Her name's... You're Dana's dad.

01:10:26.339 --> 01:10:28.382
Yeah. Is she... Is she here?

01:10:28.842 --> 01:10:32.511
Nope. The whole family's on the odyssey.
Chasing the swell, you know.

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:33.846
Well, except us folks.

01:10:34.889 --> 01:10:36.473
Family? Odyssey?

01:10:36.558 --> 01:10:39.768
Mmm.
They're headed down to Jeffrey's Bay.

01:10:39.853 --> 01:10:41.270
But they got three days on you.

01:10:41.688 --> 01:10:43.647
And Lord knows where
they'll take off after that.

01:10:45.108 --> 01:10:46.567
What's the fastest way there?

01:10:46.651 --> 01:10:47.693
Airplane.

01:11:25.231 --> 01:11:29.568
Hey.

01:11:29.944 --> 01:11:31.236
You okay?

01:11:35.033 --> 01:11:36.575
Yeah.

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:39.786
I'm good.

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:44.416
You know,
we're technically homeless now.

01:11:44.501 --> 01:11:46.084
Well, we still have the bus.

01:11:46.169 --> 01:11:49.296
Yup, and a big, weird,
stinky family to fill it.

01:11:52.467 --> 01:11:54.510
Yeah.

01:11:54.928 --> 01:11:57.930
I'm just glad Pushy and I are good again.
Yeah.

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:02.893
Man, I hope she makes that team.

01:12:03.436 --> 01:12:06.104
Tryouts are this Saturday,
that's two days away.

01:12:06.773 --> 01:12:07.940
Yeah.

01:12:10.443 --> 01:12:13.278
It's really great how you supported her.

01:12:15.615 --> 01:12:18.283
You're a really special person, Dana.

01:12:20.495 --> 01:12:23.372
Yeah?
Do you wanna write me a song about it?

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:26.250
I already did.

01:12:26.334 --> 01:12:27.543
Oh, my God! You did?

01:12:27.627 --> 01:12:29.378
Yeah. How's it go?

01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:32.631
It's complicated.

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:33.966
No kidding.

01:12:35.301 --> 01:12:37.302
Come on, let's hear it.

01:13:46.581 --> 01:13:48.415
It is.

01:13:49.584 --> 01:13:51.335
Yeah.

01:14:08.061 --> 01:14:09.061
Whoo!

01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:11.855
Go for it, Tim!

01:14:13.691 --> 01:14:15.150
Thank you.

01:14:34.462 --> 01:14:38.674
Okay, fasten your seatbelts,
hold on to your chickens,

01:14:38.758 --> 01:14:40.258
we flyin'.

01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:08.555
J-bay!

01:16:08.639 --> 01:16:10.140
Yeah!

01:16:18.858 --> 01:16:20.358
Wow.

01:17:08.407 --> 01:17:09.825
We made it.

01:17:09.909 --> 01:17:11.409
We did.

01:17:31.097 --> 01:17:35.600
Whoa.
I can see why your mom wanted to surf it.

01:17:35.685 --> 01:17:38.728
Why everyone wants to surf it. Yeah.

01:17:38.813 --> 01:17:41.815
But maybe it's a boy's club for a reason.

01:17:41.899 --> 01:17:44.609
That wave is a bone crusher.

01:17:45.903 --> 01:17:47.863
What's wrong?

01:17:49.407 --> 01:17:50.699
I don't know.

01:17:50.783 --> 01:17:53.660
I'm not afraid.
I'm gonna surf it for my mom,

01:17:53.744 --> 01:17:57.038
but I just can't help feeling that
I'm missing something.

01:17:57.123 --> 01:17:58.456
Yeah?

01:18:01.127 --> 01:18:02.961
What do you think it is that I'm searching for?

01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:05.213
Like, what do you think this is about?

01:18:08.634 --> 01:18:11.011
I think you should turn around.

01:18:11.429 --> 01:18:13.889
What? You mean go back?

01:18:14.432 --> 01:18:17.475
No, I mean turn around.

01:18:22.148 --> 01:18:23.356
Dad?

01:18:24.191 --> 01:18:25.650
Hey, Dana.

01:18:30.948 --> 01:18:34.034
Right. Well, I'm gonna go.

01:18:34.118 --> 01:18:36.328
Give you guys some space.

01:18:45.838 --> 01:18:48.089
Tim. Tim.

01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:49.883
Dana's dad is here.

01:18:50.301 --> 01:18:52.469
Oh, wow.

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:55.555
The hell I am!

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.432
I am not going home.

01:18:57.516 --> 01:18:59.434
Dana, I came halfmay around the world...

01:18:59.518 --> 01:19:01.227
I didn't ask you to!

01:19:01.312 --> 01:19:03.355
I'm your father! Yeah? Since when?

01:19:08.194 --> 01:19:11.446
Look, I know you're going through something,

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:14.032
but you have your future to consider.

01:19:14.158 --> 01:19:15.158
You have school starting in the fall...

01:19:15.242 --> 01:19:16.284
No.

01:19:16.369 --> 01:19:20.205
That is your future,
that is your school. It's not mine.

01:19:20.539 --> 01:19:22.123
So... So what?

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:26.795
You're just going to hang out here,
surfing and...

01:19:26.879 --> 01:19:29.381
I mean, Jesus, Dana,
what are you doing here?

01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:32.133
I mean, help me out here, 'cause
I'm trying to understand.

01:19:32.218 --> 01:19:34.135
I mean, you wanna be like your mother,
is that it?

01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:35.637
Follow in her footsteps?

01:19:35.721 --> 01:19:37.681
I mean, let it go, Dana. She's dead!

01:19:46.732 --> 01:19:49.025
Wow.

01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:51.486
You really have a way with words, Dad.

01:19:51.570 --> 01:19:52.612
Dana, I...

01:19:58.411 --> 01:20:00.829
Go home.

01:20:00.913 --> 01:20:04.499
Just go home and leave me the hell alone!

01:20:08.754 --> 01:20:09.963
Dana...

01:20:16.137 --> 01:20:20.432
He thinks that just by coming
here, it shows that he cares.

01:20:21.475 --> 01:20:24.519
Well, it does.

01:20:24.603 --> 01:20:26.187
Just saying.

01:20:29.775 --> 01:20:32.360
What, you too?

01:20:32.445 --> 01:20:36.531
You know, what you're going
through is a really big deal.

01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:40.910
Whether you realize it or not.

01:20:42.121 --> 01:20:44.456
You lost your mom.

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.332
We're sorry about that.

01:20:47.793 --> 01:20:49.794
But are you ready to lose your dad, too?

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:51.755
What? No. That's not what...

01:20:51.839 --> 01:20:54.132
Maybe it is.

01:20:55.468 --> 01:20:57.677
Maybe that's the missing piece of the puzzle.

01:20:59.263 --> 01:21:01.848
Maybe that's why you're really here,

01:21:02.725 --> 01:21:05.351
to figure out the rest of the puzzle,

01:21:07.271 --> 01:21:09.814
before you lose that, too.

01:21:11.692 --> 01:21:13.777
Wow.

01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:15.653
Aren't you a smart boy.

01:21:17.656 --> 01:21:18.990
Not so smart.

01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:26.915
Hey, listen.

01:21:27.958 --> 01:21:30.502
Unmistakable party sounds.

01:21:30.586 --> 01:21:34.130
Hell, let's crash it.
I could use a distraction.

01:21:35.841 --> 01:21:37.634
It looks like there's
a lot of Roxy people.

01:21:38.177 --> 01:21:39.803
May be a chance to make a good impression.

01:21:39.887 --> 01:21:41.471
I don't know about this.

01:21:47.853 --> 01:21:49.312
Congratulations, you made it.

01:21:49.396 --> 01:21:51.439
Yep. I'll take that 100 now.

01:21:51.524 --> 01:21:54.150
Not just yet.
She still has to surf Supertubes.

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:55.318
I will.

01:21:55.402 --> 01:21:57.153
Change your mind about
trying out for the team?

01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:59.697
Nope. And neither did Push.

01:22:02.493 --> 01:22:04.661
She'll be there. Really?

01:22:06.497 --> 01:22:08.456
That I can't wait to see.

01:22:11.794 --> 01:22:13.795
Really? What...

01:22:14.588 --> 01:22:16.214
How you doing? How you doing?

01:22:21.595 --> 01:22:22.720
Crap. Come on.

01:22:26.934 --> 01:22:28.309
Hey, Grant.

01:22:30.396 --> 01:22:31.646
We need to talk.

01:22:31.730 --> 01:22:32.981
Man, you don't wanna do this.

01:22:33.065 --> 01:22:34.566
People have told me things.

01:22:35.067 --> 01:22:36.985
I don't wanna believe them.

01:22:37.069 --> 01:22:38.945
I wanna hear the truth from my friend.

01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:41.364
What things?
What are you talking about?

01:22:41.448 --> 01:22:43.241
Please, tell me it isn't true, man.

01:22:43.450 --> 01:22:45.910
Tell me it isn't true about the tusks.

01:22:47.454 --> 01:22:48.830
I'm outta here. Answer the question!

01:22:48.956 --> 01:22:50.665
Is it true?

01:22:53.586 --> 01:22:55.253
Hey, hey, stop it!

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:58.131
Back off.
This is between the two of them.

01:23:17.776 --> 01:23:19.903
Come on, guys, that's enough.

01:23:20.571 --> 01:23:21.613
That's enough!

01:23:43.344 --> 01:23:44.427
Why?

01:23:48.807 --> 01:23:50.808
I needed the money, bro.

01:23:52.853 --> 01:23:54.979
I'm broke.

01:23:56.815 --> 01:23:59.067
I was just the middleman.

01:23:59.151 --> 01:24:01.486
I made a stupid mistake!

01:24:13.499 --> 01:24:14.958
What, so you...

01:24:15.209 --> 01:24:16.751
You bailing on me, too?

01:24:20.005 --> 01:24:21.881
Give me one good reason I shouldn't.

01:24:30.641 --> 01:24:33.017
We know what it means
and we know what it takes,

01:24:33.269 --> 01:24:34.978
so to us you're all winners.

01:24:48.534 --> 01:24:50.201
I'm telling you,

01:24:50.286 --> 01:24:52.996
they're gonna recognize me from last night.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.623
"There's that troublemaker."

01:24:55.708 --> 01:24:57.500
Pushy, be serious.

01:24:58.085 --> 01:24:59.919
They probably didn't even notice us.

01:25:12.433 --> 01:25:13.725
Nice seeing you again.

01:25:14.101 --> 01:25:16.144
Thanks for ruining the party last night.

01:25:16.228 --> 01:25:18.146
She's okay. I know her.

01:25:21.942 --> 01:25:23.651
Seriously. She's cool.

01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:29.824
Okay.

01:25:29.908 --> 01:25:32.410
Put this on over your wetsuit
and wait to be called.

01:25:34.246 --> 01:25:35.580
Thank you.

01:25:41.754 --> 01:25:43.087
So sorry.

01:25:47.843 --> 01:25:49.052
Sorry.

01:25:51.472 --> 01:25:53.806
Welcome, ladies,
to the Roxy team tryouts,

01:25:53.891 --> 01:25:56.934
here at Phantom Reef in the
surf town of Jeffrey's Bay.

01:25:57.061 --> 01:25:59.562
It's one heat per girl, two girls per heat.

01:25:59.730 --> 01:26:02.648
You go head-to-head,
and you only have 10 minutes.

01:26:02.733 --> 01:26:03.983
So, give it your best.

01:26:04.068 --> 01:26:06.527
And if that isn't enough pressure,

01:26:06.612 --> 01:26:09.864
here to comment for us today,
straight from the world tour,

01:26:09.948 --> 01:26:13.743
Roxy's own Sally Fitzgibbons,
and Laura Enever.

01:26:15.496 --> 01:26:19.540
Hey, girls, I just wanna say I know what
it took for you to be here today,

01:26:19.625 --> 01:26:21.501
because four years ago, this was us.

01:26:21.794 --> 01:26:24.295
And make no mistake,
the competition's tough.

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:27.799
Especially since we're only looking
for one more Roxy team rider.

01:26:28.092 --> 01:26:31.886
By the end of today, one of you
is going to be one of us.

01:26:35.849 --> 01:26:37.266
Let the games begin!

01:26:37.351 --> 01:26:39.727
Heat number one, Savage and Nahoma.

01:26:42.147 --> 01:26:45.024
Heat number two, Jackson and Dottie.

01:26:46.193 --> 01:26:49.028
Heat number three,
Hoffmeyer and Saville.

01:26:51.323 --> 01:26:53.241
Okay, next heat.

01:26:54.368 --> 01:26:56.828
Heat number four, Cochran and Knotts.

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.792
Weak backside. You'd kick her ass.

01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:12.385
Okay, let's have our final heat.

01:27:12.511 --> 01:27:14.720
Kamalo and Bahn, you're up. Okay.

01:27:16.432 --> 01:27:17.890
All you need is one good ride.

01:27:18.434 --> 01:27:20.852
One, and you get to keep that vest.

01:27:21.854 --> 01:27:23.104
Okay? Let's do it.

01:27:23.188 --> 01:27:24.272
Okay. Okay.

01:27:24.356 --> 01:27:26.649
Kamalo and Bahn, let's go!

01:27:32.197 --> 01:27:33.614
Do me proud.

01:27:36.785 --> 01:27:38.995
- Right, Pushy!
- Go, Pushy!

01:27:40.914 --> 01:27:43.583
Come on, Pushy! Come on!

01:27:44.585 --> 01:27:45.835
Yeah, Pushy!

01:28:10.152 --> 01:28:13.779
You know, these girls worked
so hard and sacrificed so much.

01:28:13.864 --> 01:28:15.907
It takes real guts just to be out there.

01:28:25.042 --> 01:28:26.918
That's gotta hurt!

01:28:35.385 --> 01:28:38.804
Looks like purple needs to shake
it off and get back out there.

01:28:44.770 --> 01:28:47.688
Nice riding for yellow, though.
Should be a good score.

01:28:48.315 --> 01:28:50.024
Okay, watch the outside.

01:28:50.108 --> 01:28:51.150
Come on.

01:28:57.866 --> 01:28:59.283
What's that?

01:29:01.745 --> 01:29:03.704
I remember this girl from last year.

01:29:03.789 --> 01:29:04.997
Yeah, so do I.

01:29:05.207 --> 01:29:08.876
Only a handful of black female
surfers have ever competed,

01:29:09.044 --> 01:29:11.963
so we're witnessing a little
piece of history right now.

01:29:14.675 --> 01:29:15.967
How did you find this?

01:29:17.469 --> 01:29:21.973
Well, it turns out when Grant found out it
was your thing that that guy stole, he...

01:29:22.057 --> 01:29:23.558
He knew?

01:29:23.642 --> 01:29:25.810
Only after you found his
truck and yelled at him.

01:29:26.311 --> 01:29:30.064
But he took his sweet time
getting it back to you.

01:29:30.148 --> 01:29:31.816
Probably because of you and Tim.

01:29:32.859 --> 01:29:35.903
You know, male rivalry and all that.

01:29:39.408 --> 01:29:40.992
You've got one minute.

01:29:41.076 --> 01:29:42.785
One minute to go in this heat.

01:29:43.078 --> 01:29:44.245
This is it.

01:29:44.329 --> 01:29:46.163
One minute to go in this
year's Roxy team tryouts.

01:29:46.248 --> 01:29:47.748
Come on, Pushy!

01:29:49.543 --> 01:29:52.461
This is your time, Pushy. Represent.

01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:55.673
She better get her ass going.

01:29:55.924 --> 01:29:59.635
She's really going to have to get
moving to get around this section.

01:30:00.012 --> 01:30:01.095
Come on.

01:30:12.608 --> 01:30:13.941
Come on, Pushy!

01:30:14.026 --> 01:30:16.861
Okay, surfer's in position.
She's paddling hard.

01:30:30.334 --> 01:30:31.834
Okay she's up and riding.

01:30:31.918 --> 01:30:33.252
What's she gonna do?

01:30:33.587 --> 01:30:34.629
Come on, Pushy.

01:30:52.731 --> 01:30:53.981
Oh, my God!

01:30:54.066 --> 01:30:55.358
Nice one.

01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:17.213
Oh, my God! She did it!

01:31:25.347 --> 01:31:29.058
She pulled it off. She did it! Yeah!

01:31:29.935 --> 01:31:33.229
Wow.
That was the best surfing we've seen all day.

01:31:33.313 --> 01:31:34.855
Well, it took a long time coming.

01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:38.776
Yeah, it was a slow start by purple,
but that aerial really made up for it.

01:31:38.944 --> 01:31:40.528
We'll have to see what
the judges have to say.

01:31:40.779 --> 01:31:42.071
Wouldn't wanna be in their seats.

01:31:42.155 --> 01:31:43.280
Everyone, gather around.

01:31:43.365 --> 01:31:45.866
We're gonna have an announcement
in about two minutes' time.

01:31:48.203 --> 01:31:49.245
You got it, okay?

01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:53.416
That was a lekker ride.

01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:55.543
You need to work on
your consistency, though.

01:31:56.002 --> 01:31:58.421
And you need to read the waves.

01:32:01.049 --> 01:32:04.301
So, we've got a big decision to make here.

01:32:04.678 --> 01:32:06.345
It's okay, you've got this.

01:32:06.471 --> 01:32:08.264
You killed it. You killed it.

01:32:10.142 --> 01:32:13.811
What do you think?
So, we're thinking there's only...

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:17.106
Okay, ladies, I know it's
been a tough competition.

01:32:17.566 --> 01:32:19.442
You should all feel like winners.

01:32:19.526 --> 01:32:22.695
Unfortunately, there's only one
space left on the Roxy team.

01:32:22.988 --> 01:32:25.531
And our overall winner today

01:32:26.324 --> 01:32:27.742
is Pushy Kamalo.

01:32:40.130 --> 01:32:42.381
Pushy!
Pushy! Pushy! Pushy!

01:33:04.529 --> 01:33:07.948
So, welcome to the team.

01:33:12.913 --> 01:33:14.955
What took you so long?

01:33:15.957 --> 01:33:17.750
Thank you.

01:33:26.551 --> 01:33:31.347
And I want to thank all of my
friends for feeding the fire.

01:33:31.431 --> 01:33:32.556
Cheers.

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:36.143
And I want to thank you
for keeping me going.

01:33:37.854 --> 01:33:39.313
Thank you.

01:33:56.081 --> 01:33:57.414
Will you guys give me a few minutes?

01:33:59.459 --> 01:34:01.585
Take all the time you need.

01:34:09.469 --> 01:34:11.846
I'm so proud of you.

01:34:14.641 --> 01:34:17.768
So, do you come here often?

01:34:18.562 --> 01:34:20.479
Once every 20 years or so.

01:34:24.776 --> 01:34:26.735
Can I show you something?

01:34:45.797 --> 01:34:48.632
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.

01:34:49.593 --> 01:34:51.635
No, it's just

01:34:52.971 --> 01:34:54.513
seeing these,

01:34:56.433 --> 01:34:58.475
it brings back memories.

01:34:59.978 --> 01:35:02.354
Your mother and I, we...

01:35:02.731 --> 01:35:06.066
We took the same trip that summer we met.

01:35:06.693 --> 01:35:09.820
I know.
That's why I wanted to show you.

01:35:17.829 --> 01:35:20.998
I also wanted to apologize.

01:35:21.875 --> 01:35:24.460
I didn't mean what I said last night.

01:35:26.212 --> 01:35:28.631
It's weird,

01:35:28.715 --> 01:35:30.633
but these past couple of weeks

01:35:31.509 --> 01:35:35.095
I've learned what it means
to be part of a family.

01:35:35.889 --> 01:35:38.098
I understand.

01:35:39.684 --> 01:35:42.353
After your mom died,

01:35:44.105 --> 01:35:46.565
the truth is, I couldn't handle it.

01:35:47.859 --> 01:35:50.527
I just... I shut down.

01:35:51.821 --> 01:35:53.822
I shut down when you needed me the most.

01:35:56.117 --> 01:35:58.327
You did all right, Dad.

01:35:59.329 --> 01:36:02.456
You always found a way to take care of me.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.043
Too much sometimes.

01:36:06.586 --> 01:36:08.253
I know.

01:36:08.338 --> 01:36:09.964
And I was wrong about that, too.

01:36:11.549 --> 01:36:14.218
I tried to control you.

01:36:14.302 --> 01:36:17.096
I was just so afraid of losing you.

01:36:18.723 --> 01:36:20.599
Just like I lost her.

01:36:23.395 --> 01:36:25.229
And now I've lost you both.

01:36:27.399 --> 01:36:28.983
You haven't lost me, Dad.

01:36:58.221 --> 01:37:00.014
I think it's time.

01:37:26.833 --> 01:37:29.168
You're home now, Mom.

01:37:44.934 --> 01:37:47.519
One more thing left to do.

01:39:27.328 --> 01:39:29.163
Hey, what's it like out there?

01:39:29.247 --> 01:39:30.330
It's firing.

01:39:31.249 --> 01:39:32.291
Do you reckon they'll let me in?

01:39:32.917 --> 01:39:34.084
Um...

01:39:34.169 --> 01:39:36.420
Yeah, I'm sure if you show a
little respect you'll be fine.

01:39:38.256 --> 01:39:39.673
It's actually pretty heavy out there.

01:39:39.757 --> 01:39:41.049
You sure you're in the right place?

01:39:44.095 --> 01:39:45.554
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:39:45.638 --> 01:39:47.806
Okay, good luck.

01:39:48.141 --> 01:39:49.391
Thanks.

01:40:41.444 --> 01:40:42.778
Hey, locals only.

01:40:44.239 --> 01:40:46.531
No lifeguards here, sweetheart.

01:40:47.158 --> 01:40:49.368
It's too hot for girls.
Seriously, get out of here.

01:40:50.161 --> 01:40:51.703
Just leave before you kill yourself.

01:40:53.164 --> 01:40:55.290
All right, guys, guys. Just chill, all right?

01:40:55.375 --> 01:40:57.960
Just let her through. She's cool.

01:41:01.339 --> 01:41:02.422
Good luck.

01:41:03.675 --> 01:41:04.800
I'm outta here.

01:41:06.511 --> 01:41:08.178
Think you're tough?

01:41:13.393 --> 01:41:15.435
Hey,
kiddie beach is down the way.

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:17.688
Go on, you don't belong here.
Get out of here.

01:41:17.772 --> 01:41:19.231
Just go home.

01:41:24.362 --> 01:41:26.154
Looks huge out there.

01:41:26.614 --> 01:41:28.073
Yeah.

01:41:29.826 --> 01:41:31.034
This is it.

01:41:34.539 --> 01:41:35.998
Where is she?

01:41:39.877 --> 01:41:42.045
Oh, shit.

01:41:44.215 --> 01:41:46.591
I mean, she'll be fine.

01:41:49.345 --> 01:41:51.054
I think.

01:41:56.227 --> 01:41:58.687
Let's go up top. Better view.

01:43:24.357 --> 01:43:25.732
Hey, you okay?

01:43:25.817 --> 01:43:27.067
Watch the waves.

01:43:27.151 --> 01:43:28.735
You're tougher than you look.

01:43:31.489 --> 01:43:34.324
When you go, go.
Don't hesitate. Go for it.

01:43:54.011 --> 01:43:55.846
Come on, you can do this.

01:43:57.598 --> 01:44:00.392
Go for it, you can do it.

01:44:16.534 --> 01:44:18.660
Man, she's got it.

01:45:55.675 --> 01:45:56.841
Whoo!

01:46:30.084 --> 01:46:31.126
Yes!

01:46:33.671 --> 01:46:36.339
Looked pretty free-spirited to me.

01:46:38.801 --> 01:46:40.302
Did you get what you wanted?

01:46:51.147 --> 01:46:52.439
Yeah.

01:46:54.984 --> 01:46:56.026
I'm so proud of you.

01:46:56.569 --> 01:46:57.611
Thanks, Dad.

01:46:57.695 --> 01:46:59.321
Your mom would have been, too.

01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:40.625
Hit us with it, Cowboy.

01:50:47.424 --> 01:50:49.384
Wait, tell us what she was doing.
