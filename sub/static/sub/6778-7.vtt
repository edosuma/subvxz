01:47.240 --> 01:49.663
( female on intercom )
O.R. three.

01:49.770 --> 01:51.032
WHAT'S THE MATI'ER ?

01:51.140 --> 01:52.778
I'M SCARED.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.734
DON'T BE.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.171
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.511
C'MON, C'MON.

02:01.850 --> 02:03.442
I'M ALMOST DONE.

02:04.590 --> 02:06.512
OKAY.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.623
( heavy breathing )

02:09.730 --> 02:12.153
AT FIRST, I JUST
THOUGHT THEY'D GO AWAY,

02:12.260 --> 02:13.397
BUT THEY NEVER DID.

02:13.500 --> 02:17.823
THEY JUST KEPT
GROWING AND GROWING.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.329
I SEE YOU'VE
HAD SYMPTOMS...

02:22.440 --> 02:26.069
MAINLY JUST INDIGESTION
WHICH I'VE ALWAYS HAD.

02:26.180 --> 02:29.104
EVEN AS A CHILD,
I HAD A NERVOUS STOMACH.

02:29.210 --> 02:31.007
BUT THERE'S ALSO
BEEN VOMITING,

02:31.110 --> 02:32.441
AND BLOOD
IN YOUR STOOL.

02:32.550 --> 02:35.678
WHY DIDN'T
YOU CALL ME ?

02:35.780 --> 02:36.644
I KNEW WE SHOULD.

02:36.750 --> 02:39.048
SOMEHOW I JUST KEPT...
PUTTING IT OFF.

02:39.150 --> 02:41.812
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO
TO FLORIDA NEXT WEEK

02:41.920 --> 02:43.228
TO VISIT OUR SON.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.649
WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN OVER A YEAR.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.320
WE WERE GONNA CALL YOU
AS SOON AS WE GOT BACK.

02:47.430 --> 02:49.625
BUT THE PAIN
GOT TOO BAD.

02:49.730 --> 02:51.595
I WISH YOU HAD CALLED ME
AS SOON AS YOU...

02:51.700 --> 02:53.861
WELL...

02:53.970 --> 02:55.733
WE'LL JUST START
DOING SOME TESTS

02:55.840 --> 02:58.206
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

02:58.310 --> 03:00.778
WHAT WOULD
BE THE WORST ?

03:00.880 --> 03:04.976
THAT TH ESE ARE TWO TUMORS
WHICH MAY HAVE METASTASIZED

03:05.080 --> 03:07.048
AND SPREAD.

03:07.150 --> 03:09.584
OH JEEZ.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.456
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
THAT'S THE CASE ?

03:13.560 --> 03:16.723
LET'S JUST DO THE TESTS
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.003
CLAIRE ?

03:39.110 --> 03:41.715
OH, MORNING.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.288
IT'S NOT VERY GOOD.

03:46.390 --> 03:49.382
I THINK MOM'S MACHINE'S
A LITTLE MORE LOW TECH.

03:49.490 --> 03:52.084
SOMETIMES I MISS THE DAYS
WHEN COFFEE WAS JUST COFFEE.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.318
OH, I HAVE A HUGE
DARKROOM DAY TODAY,

03:55.430 --> 03:57.125
BUT HOPEFULLY I'LL BE BACK
IN TIME FOR DINNER.

03:57.230 --> 03:58.424
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

03:58.530 --> 03:59.189
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO STAY HERE ANYMORE.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.130
IT'S TOO MUCH.

04:00.240 --> 04:00.990
NO, IT ISN'T.

04:01.100 --> 04:02.636
IT IS.

04:02.740 --> 04:04.139
I WAS BAD BEFORE, BUT NOW
I'M STARTING TO SLEEP A LITTLE.

04:04.240 --> 04:08.006
I HAVEN'T HAD A PANIC A'I'I'ACK
IN TWO DAYS AND...

04:08.110 --> 04:09.600
I'VE EVEN CUT DOWN
ON ALL THE ATIVAN.

04:09.710 --> 04:13.373
SO, YOU ARE OFFICIALLY
EVICT ED AS OF TODAY.

04:16.950 --> 04:18.611
DAVID, ARE YOU SURE ?

04:20.360 --> 04:23.227
GEEZ, THIS COFFEE
REALLY IS GROSS.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.922
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK
MAYBE I SHOULD STAY.

04:25.030 --> 04:28.397
I DON'T NEED MY BABY SISTER
BABY-SITTING ME ANYMORE, OKAY ?!

04:43.850 --> 04:45.408
( clearing throat)

04:47.350 --> 04:49.113
HEY, DID YOU HEAR
THOSE TWO CATS HAVING SEX

04:49.220 --> 04:50.642
IN THE ALLEY
LAST NIGHT ?

04:50.750 --> 04:53.082
THEY WERE WORSE
THAN MOM AND GEORGE.

04:53.190 --> 04:55.954
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DO IT,
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S SO PAINFUL.

04:56.060 --> 04:58.085
I MEAN, THEY LIVE
IN AN ALLEY.

04:58.190 --> 05:00.055
THEY DESERVE SOME
KIND OF DIVERSION.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.923
DON'T YOU THINK ?

05:03.570 --> 05:05.094
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID ?

05:05.200 --> 05:07.395
YES, YOU CAN'T
SEE ME ANYMORE.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.968
IT'S OVER,
GOOD-BYE.

05:11.140 --> 05:12.061
GOOD-BYE, RICO.

05:12.170 --> 05:13.432
THEN GET
OUT OF HERE.

05:14.140 --> 05:15.607
I AM SO STUPID.

05:15.710 --> 05:17.109
I HID THAT PACK
OF CIGARE'I'I'ES

05:17.210 --> 05:18.404
FROM MYSELF SO GOOD
I CAN'T FIND THEM.

05:18.510 --> 05:20.944
DID YOU LOOK ON TOP
OF THE REFRIGERATOR ?

05:29.790 --> 05:32.497
I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT I'M SORRY,

05:32.600 --> 05:35.990
BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE THIS
ISN'T RIGHT IN SOME WAY.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.489
TO MY WIFE
AND TO MY KIDS.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.465
OH, YEAH,
AND WHY IS THAT ?

05:40.570 --> 05:42.401
THIS IS NOT
ABOUT FUCKING.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.432
YOU'VE MADE THAT
PLAIN AND CLEAR.

05:44.540 --> 05:47.373
THIS IS ABOUT
JUST BEING FRIENDS.

05:48.580 --> 05:51.071
I THINK I NEED
MORE GUY FRIENDS.

05:51.180 --> 05:54.411
OF COURSE YOU TELL ME TODAY
WHEN MY LUPUS IS ACTING UP.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.080
YOU KNOW, I GAVE YOU
ALL THAT MONEY

05:57.190 --> 05:59.488
AND I NEVER HEARD A WORD
ABOUT YOU GOING TO A DOCTOR.

05:59.590 --> 06:00.909
DID YOU EVEN
GO TO ONE--

06:01.020 --> 06:03.625
I GOT THE DAMN LUPUS !

06:06.030 --> 06:07.793
YOU NEVER
EVEN LIKED ME.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.960
THIS WAS ABOUT YOU NEEDING
TO FEEL LIKE A BIG MAN.

06:11.070 --> 06:14.289
AND NOW THAT YOU GOT WHAT
YOU NEED, YOU'RE DONE.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.890
OKAY.

06:17.370 --> 06:19.235
JUST LEAVE THE GIFT
THAT YOU PROMISED NICOLE

06:19.340 --> 06:20.637
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

06:20.740 --> 06:21.968
OH SHIT.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.377
YOU DIDN'T EVEN BRING
THE DUMB "JACK THE PIG" BOOK,

06:23.480 --> 06:25.004
YOU BEEN GOING
ON AND ON ABOUT ?

06:25.110 --> 06:26.202
I LEFI' IT AT WORK.

06:26.310 --> 06:27.675
I COULD BRING IT
BY TOMORROW.

06:27.780 --> 06:28.371
FORGET IT.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.085
SHE NEEDS TO LEARN...

06:31.190 --> 06:33.454
PEOPLE PROMISE
YOU THINGS,

06:35.190 --> 06:36.726
BUT THEN LEAVE

06:36.830 --> 06:40.049
WHEN THEY GET
TIRED OF YOU.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.748
SHE'S GEORGE'S
NEW WIFE.

07:09.860 --> 07:11.748
THE ONE WHO
CAME AFTER YOU.

07:11.860 --> 07:12.792
JESUS, LADY.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.197
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING ?

07:14.300 --> 07:15.653
GEORGE IS GONNA
KILL YOU

07:15.760 --> 07:16.522
IF HE FINDS YOU
MESSING WITH HIS THINGS.

07:16.630 --> 07:17.426
YOU'RE SNOOPING.

07:17.530 --> 07:18.895
YOU'RE TOO SNOOPY.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.639
I WAS TOO SNOOPY AND HE
GOT RID OF ME BUT QUICK.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.708
BOY, YOU ARE
SOME DUMB CLUCK.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.630
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY GEORGE DOESN'T

07:25.740 --> 07:28.208
LIKE TO BE ASKED ANYTHING
ABOUT HIS PAST ?

07:28.310 --> 07:29.299
YES, I DO, TELL ME.

07:29.410 --> 07:30.479
PLEASE, TELL ME.

07:30.580 --> 07:35.142
( laughing )

07:36.590 --> 07:38.808
WHAT DOESN'T
HE WANT ME TO KNOW ?!

07:41.190 --> 07:43.454
WHY CAN'T
I KNOW ANYTHING ?!

07:43.560 --> 07:46.222
( laughing continues )

07:51.270 --> 07:53.738
( gasping )

07:59.140 --> 08:01.199
( Rico )
ALL OF TH ESE CASKETS
ARE AVAILABLE

08:01.310 --> 08:02.572
WITH CUSTOMIZED INSERTS.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.375
YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR WIFE'S NAME.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.244
HER FAVORITE
BIBLE VERSE.

08:07.350 --> 08:08.612
A FAMILY PHOTO.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.018
IS THERE ONE
THAT APPEALS TO YOU ?

08:11.120 --> 08:12.678
I DON'T KNOW, SON.

08:12.790 --> 08:16.317
YOU SEEMED TO LIKE
THE BLUE ONE.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.957
THERE'S JUST A LOT
OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS.

08:19.060 --> 08:21.494
I JUST THINK THAT MAYBE YOU NEED
TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO LOOK.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.922
I'LL GIVE YOU TWO
A MOMENT TO DECIDE.

08:25.030 --> 08:26.463
OKAY.

08:26.570 --> 08:28.128
THANK YOU.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.501
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
HERE 40 MINUTES AGO.

08:33.610 --> 08:35.805
WELL, MAYA'S STILL NOT
USED TO DAY CARE YET.

08:35.910 --> 08:37.377
I HAD TO STAY
WITH HER FOR A WHILE.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.072
NO ONE WAS HERE
TO MEET THE MORRISONS.

08:39.180 --> 08:40.477
WELL, WHERE WERE YOU ?

08:40.580 --> 08:41.945
THAT'S NOT
THE POINT.

08:42.050 --> 08:43.244
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA TALK ABOUT

08:43.350 --> 08:44.544
THE ARRANGEMENTS
WITH MOM.

08:44.650 --> 08:45.878
SHE MUST HAVE TOLD YOU
WHAT SHE WANTED.

08:45.990 --> 08:47.810
I TRIED TO BRING IT UP
WITH HER, BUT...

08:47.920 --> 08:50.184
IT ALWAYS SEEMED
LIKE A BAD TIME.

08:51.630 --> 08:53.655
FINE, THEN...

08:55.300 --> 08:56.858
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

08:57.700 --> 08:59.190
YOU PICK THE CASKET,

08:59.300 --> 09:02.531
AND THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT
WHO'S GONNA SPEAK AT THIS THING.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.571
DAD, I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT HERE.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.368
I WANT HER BACK.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.710
I WANT THINGS BACK
THE WAY THEY USED TO BE.

09:15.820 --> 09:17.981
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.251
IF YOU GUYS HADN'T BEEN SO
SCARED ABOUT FACING THE TRUTH,

09:20.360 --> 09:24.023
MAYBE MOM WOULD BE ALIVE AND WE
WOULDN'T HAVE TO FUCKING DECIDE

09:24.130 --> 09:26.792
ABOUT WHAT CASKET
SHE'S GONNA BE BURIED IN.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.089
SO APPARENTLY THE FATHER
NEVER SAID A WORD TO ANYONE

09:30.200 --> 09:32.259
AS THE TUMORS JUST KEPT
GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER.

09:32.370 --> 09:35.464
MAN, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND PEOPLE.

09:35.570 --> 09:37.834
I GET IT.

09:37.940 --> 09:41.899
HAVING TO ADMIT FUCKED UP SHIT
ABOUT YOURSELF FUCKING SUCKS.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.705
OH, COME ON !

09:48.850 --> 09:51.284
DAVID'S BEEN
CLEANING AGAIN.

09:51.390 --> 09:52.288
SO WHAT ?

09:52.390 --> 09:53.254
IT RELAXES HIM.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.179
HONESTLY ?

09:54.290 --> 09:55.552
IT'S A LITTLE
ANNOYING.

09:55.660 --> 09:56.957
I COULD HAVE USED HIM
UPSTAIRS WITH THE MORRISONS.

09:57.060 --> 09:59.995
I'M DOING INTAKES,
DAVID'S STAYING DOWN HERE.

10:02.460 --> 10:06.066
I KNOW THAT DAVID DOESN'T WANT
TO BE AROUND PEOPLE RIGHT NOW,

10:07.170 --> 10:08.364
BUT...

10:08.470 --> 10:09.960
IF YOU'VE DECIDED YOU WANTED
TO COME BACK TO THE BUSINESS,

10:10.070 --> 10:11.298
THEN BE BACK.

10:11.410 --> 10:12.729
THE TWO OF YOU ARE JUST ACTING
LIKE YOU CAN JUST COME AND GO,

10:12.840 --> 10:14.330
AND DO WHATEVER
THE HELL YOU WANT.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.668
WHY ARE WE BUYING
THE FAKE WINDEX

10:15.780 --> 10:17.668
WHEN THE REAL KIND IS
THE ONLY ONE THAT WORKS ?

10:17.780 --> 10:20.271
I'LL GET SOME
REAL WINDEX LATER.

10:23.220 --> 10:25.040
SINCE THERE'S NOTHING
GOING ON HERE NOW,

10:25.150 --> 10:26.913
DO YOU MIND SWINGING
BY THE HOSPITAL

10:27.020 --> 10:28.908
TO PICK UP
MRS. MORRISON ?

10:29.020 --> 10:30.055
UM...

10:30.160 --> 10:31.184
I'M CLEANING.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.850
THAT'S FINE, WE'LL
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.848
DIDN'T I JUST
HAVE A RAG ?

10:35.960 --> 10:37.427
I MUST HAVE
LEI-T IT OUT THERE.

10:37.530 --> 10:38.895
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE MY MIND IS.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.888
DAVID CAN'T TAKE
THE VAN OUT ANYMORE.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.490
THE VAN IS
WHERE IT HAPPENED.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.068
THAT'S FINE,
THEN YOU GO.

10:45.170 --> 10:47.400
ACTUALLY, MAYA AND I
HAVE TO GO TO THE...

10:47.510 --> 10:49.034
MAYA'S IN DAY CARE.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.072
THAT'S RIGHT.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.740
AND THERE'S THIS
GET-TOGETHER ONCE A MONTH

10:52.850 --> 10:56.786
WHERE WE GET TOGETHER
WITH THE OTHER PARENTS.

10:59.620 --> 11:01.053
FINE.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.411
I'LL GO.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.385
GREAT.

11:04.490 --> 11:08.358
SO LONG AS YOU'RE OUT,
CAN YOU GET THE REAL WINDEX ?

11:36.460 --> 11:37.950
( water running )

11:38.060 --> 11:39.618
ANITA ?

11:39.730 --> 11:41.049
HEY.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.764
OH, HEY.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.792
ANITA WENT OVER TO RUSSELL'S
SO I JUST DECIDED TO HANG OUT

11:44.900 --> 11:46.299
AND WAIT FOR YOU.

11:50.770 --> 11:52.362
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING ?

11:53.440 --> 11:54.771
OH...

11:54.880 --> 11:57.644
NOTHING, IT'S ONE
OF MY PHOTOS.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.048
OH.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.744
IT'S ONE OF THE ONES
I TOOK OF YOU.

12:05.550 --> 12:08.053
OKAY, SO IT'S BAD.

12:08.860 --> 12:10.725
IT'S NOT.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.229
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

12:12.330 --> 12:13.820
THEN WHY
CAN'T I SEE IT ?

12:13.930 --> 12:15.591
IT'S TOO GOOD.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.464
IT'S LIKE, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS ACTUALLY CAME OUT OF ME.

12:18.570 --> 12:21.368
IT'S SO GOOD, I DON'T
EVEN WANT ANYONE TO SEE IT.

12:21.470 --> 12:23.199
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA SHOW IT
AT MY CRIT TOMORROW BECAUSE,

12:23.310 --> 12:27.804
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S JUST FOR ME.

12:28.780 --> 12:30.748
IS THAT CRAZY ?

12:30.850 --> 12:33.011
NOT AT ALL.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.149
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.091
I KNOW.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.865
I LOVE THIS SHADOW
THAT GOES ACROSS YOUR FACE.

12:56.970 --> 12:58.130
IT'S SO COOL.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.174
YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW THIS
AT YOUR CRIT.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.777
WHAT ARE YOU
SO SCARED OF ?

13:12.720 --> 13:15.188
LOOK AT
MY EXPRESSION.

13:15.290 --> 13:17.224
IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT FINALLY,
MY HOURS OF WATCHING

13:17.330 --> 13:21.050
"AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL"
HAVE PAID OFF.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.268
I DEFINITELY
OWE YOU ONE FOR THIS.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.965
I'LL THINK ABOUT HOW
I CAN COLLECT ON THAT.

13:35.140 --> 13:36.869
SO, YOU AVAILABLE
NEXT TUESDAY ?

13:36.980 --> 13:39.949
NATE, I TOLD YOU
THIS IS THE LAST TIME.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.045
( laughing )

13:42.150 --> 13:44.209
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID LAST WEEK
AND THE WEEK BEFORE THAT.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.209
NO, THIS IS
THE LAST, LAST TIME.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.856
ALRIGHT, FINE.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.985
WE'LL NEVER
TALK AGAIN.

13:51.090 --> 13:53.558
UNTIL YOU
CALL ME TOMORROW.

13:56.230 --> 13:57.299
OH, GOD.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.618
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M DOING THIS.

13:59.730 --> 14:01.937
IT'S ALL
JOE'S FAULT.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.737
IF ONLY HE ENJOYED NICE,
NORMAL, PERFECT LY AVERAGE SEX.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.102
WAIT A MINUTE.

14:07.210 --> 14:08.905
WASN'T I A LITTLE
ABOVE AVERAGE BACK THERE ?

14:09.010 --> 14:10.204
AT LEAST FOR
A FEW SECONDS ?

14:10.310 --> 14:12.870
AS OPPOSED TO WHAT
I TOLD YOU ABOUT ME AND JOE.

14:12.980 --> 14:15.642
OH, WHAT THE,
"HURT ME, MOMMY" STUFF.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.547
GIVE ME A BREAK,
BREN.

14:17.650 --> 14:19.311
EXCUSE ME ?

14:19.420 --> 14:21.012
THIS ISN'T ABOUT JOE,
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.951
I OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.925
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?

14:25.030 --> 14:27.021
YOU AND JOE
MOVE IN TOGETHER.

14:27.130 --> 14:29.428
YOU GET SCARED
BY THE INTIMACY.

14:29.530 --> 14:32.192
YOU FREAK OUT AND YOU HAVE SEX
OUTSIDE THE RELATIONSHIP.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.461
YOU CAN'T FOOL ME,
I USED TO BE JOE.

14:38.070 --> 14:40.538
WELL, THIS IS ALL
VERY ILLUMINATING.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.904
WHAT ABOUT YOU ?

14:43.010 --> 14:44.546
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS ?

14:44.650 --> 14:45.969
WHY NOT ?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.012
RIGHT NOW, I'M AT A PLACE
IN MY LIFE WHERE I JUST

14:47.120 --> 14:48.678
WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN.

14:48.780 --> 14:50.179
OF COURSE.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.985
THIS COULDN'T BE JUST
ANOTHER WAY FOR YOU TO AVOID

14:52.090 --> 14:55.651
HAVING A PERMANENT
REAL RELATIONSHIP.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.625
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR ?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.322
THE CONDOM.

14:59.430 --> 15:02.456
I DROPPED IT ON THE FLOOR WHEN
I TOOK IT OFF AND NOW I CAN'T--

15:02.560 --> 15:03.891
OH,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.228
HERE IT IS.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.035
SPERM IS...

15:17.510 --> 15:19.478
I DON'T KNOW.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.286
IT SEEMS SO TINY
TO BE ABLE TO DO SO MUCH.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.017
I KNOW.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.508
IT'S ODD.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.635
I'M GOING TO BE GONE
ALL DAY TOMORROW.

15:48.710 --> 15:50.405
OKAY.

15:54.150 --> 15:57.483
I'M GOING TO HUNT
FOR FOSSILS IN COLD CANYON

15:57.590 --> 15:59.342
LIKE I DO EVERY YEAR.

15:59.450 --> 16:00.587
OH, THAT'S NICE.

16:00.690 --> 16:03.488
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR ANNUAL
FOSSIL HUNT MEANS TO YOU.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.750
YOU COULD COME WITH ME, IF YOU
WOULDN'T FIND IT TOO BORING.

16:08.860 --> 16:09.997
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.829
I HAVE TO RETURN
SOME BOOKS TO THE LIBRARY.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.069
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO INVITE ME.

16:14.170 --> 16:16.866
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU TO DO WHATEVER
YOU WANTHENEVER YOU WANT

16:16.970 --> 16:20.076
WITH WHOMEVER YOU WANT.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.677
OKAY.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.143
BUT I WANT TO GO
FOSSIL HUNTING

16:28.250 --> 16:32.641
SO I WILL GO
FOSSIL HUNTING, DARN IT.

16:38.090 --> 16:40.627
OKAY, NOW I'M STARTING
TO FREAK OUT.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.129
I'M SURE
WE'LL FIND IT.

16:42.230 --> 16:43.629
IT'S MY FAVORITE
EARRING.

16:43.730 --> 16:45.220
I KNOW, YOU KEEP
SAYING THAT.

16:45.330 --> 16:47.469
HEY, WHEN JAVIER
GETS HERE,

16:47.570 --> 16:49.299
I'M SURE WE'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT--

16:49.400 --> 16:50.503
NOTHING YET.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.601
BUT I'VE GOT FIVE OF DETROIT'S
FINEST LOOKING FOR IT.

16:52.710 --> 16:54.439
SO, IF IT'S IN THIS AUDITORIUM,
THEY'LL FIND IT.

16:54.540 --> 16:56.508
IT WAS GIVEN TO ME
BY THE ONLY PERSON

16:56.610 --> 16:58.703
WHO EVER REALLY,
REALLY LOVED ME...

16:58.810 --> 17:00.778
NOW IT'S LOST.

17:00.880 --> 17:05.385
OH GOD, WHEN WILL SOMEONE EVER
LOVE ME AGAIN, THE REAL ME ?

17:05.490 --> 17:08.084
EVERYONE ELSE
HAS SOMEONE.

17:08.190 --> 17:11.557
HERE IS THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE
AND HERE IS ME.

17:11.660 --> 17:13.423
YOU'RE JUST EXHAUSTED.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.998
YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO
YOUR ROOM AND GET SOME SLEEP.

17:16.100 --> 17:18.898
PLEASE DON'T MINIMIZE
MY SEVERE DEPRESSION.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.696
I WOULD NEVER
DO THAT TO YOU.

17:26.740 --> 17:29.277
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT
WILL MAKE ME FEEL BE'ITER.

17:31.180 --> 17:34.217
JUST GIVE ME A FEW MOMENTS
THEN WE'LL BLOW OUT OF HERE.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.684
WELL, WE'RE FUCKED.

17:41.790 --> 17:43.223
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

17:43.330 --> 17:45.457
HALFWAY THROUGH THE TOUR, SHE
ALWAYS GETS REALLY DEPRESSED.

17:45.560 --> 17:48.529
SO THEN WE GO TO WHATEVER
STUPID GAY CLUB WE CAN FIND

17:48.630 --> 17:51.019
THAT'S STILL OPEN SO SHE CAN
GET WORSHIPPED BY THE FAGS.

17:51.130 --> 17:52.620
WE'RE GOING
TO A GAY CLUB ?

17:52.730 --> 17:55.767
YEAH, DUDE, TRY TO ACT
A LITTLE COOLER ABOUT IT.

18:09.580 --> 18:13.357
( dance music )

18:23.170 --> 18:25.195
MIDWESTERN QUEERS
REALLY CREEP ME OUT.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.336
I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.829
KEITH CHARLES.

18:35.940 --> 18:36.907
ARE YOU STILL
WORKING ?

18:37.010 --> 18:38.546
Yeah, late night.

18:38.650 --> 18:41.175
I'M SORRY, I JUST
COULDN'T SLEEP AND I...

18:41.280 --> 18:42.269
( dance music )

18:42.380 --> 18:44.610
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE IN A BAR.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.539
I AM, WITH CELESTE.

18:45.650 --> 18:47.151
SHE'S FIGHTING
A SEVERE DEPRESSION.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.388
* OH BABY

18:50.490 --> 18:52.720
UH...

18:52.830 --> 18:53.956
THAT'S A GAY BAR.

18:54.060 --> 18:56.528
DUDE, CELESTE IS
LOOKING OVER HERE.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.769
I THINK SHE'S ANNOYED
YOU AIN'T LOOKING AT HER.

18:58.870 --> 19:00.963
LISTEN, I GO'ITA GO.

19:01.070 --> 19:02.628
I'LL CALL YOU
IN THE MORNING.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.002
Sorry to bother you.

19:04.110 --> 19:05.429
IF ANYBODY GETS MAD,

19:05.540 --> 19:07.064
JUST TELL THEM YOUR WIFE'S
ON HER WOMAN'S TIME.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.431
THEY'LL FEEL
BAD FOR YOU

19:08.540 --> 19:11.202
THAT I'M SUCH A BITCH
WHEN I'M ON THE RAG, 'NIGHT.

19:16.620 --> 19:18.247
YOUR OLD LADY
PISSED OFF ?

19:18.350 --> 19:20.682
YOU COULD'VE JUST TOLD HER
YOU WAS AT SOME FAG BAR,

19:20.790 --> 19:23.588
AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE YOU WERE
TAKING HOME SOME PUSSY TONIGHT.

19:23.690 --> 19:26.784
JAVIER, I'M GAY.

19:28.260 --> 19:29.852
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.394
I SLEEP WITH MEN,
OKAY ?

19:32.500 --> 19:35.196
I HAVE A LOT OF SEX
AND IT'S REALLY, REALLY GAY.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.435
THAT'S COOL, MAN.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.645
( sighing )

20:02.060 --> 20:04.119
WELL, THAT SITE BACK THERE
WAS COMPLETELY PICKED OVER.

20:04.230 --> 20:06.164
AND I BET I KNOW
WHO DID IT, TOO.

20:06.270 --> 20:07.931
LAST YEAR, I CAUGHT
THIS GUY FROM U.S.C.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.439
TRYING TO
FOLLOW ME--

20:09.540 --> 20:10.905
GEORGE, I THINK
I'M DEHYDRATING.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.363
NONSENSE.

20:12.470 --> 20:14.370
I AM, I'M ABOUT
TO DEHYDRATE.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.745
WHY DID YOU DRINK ALL
YOUR WATER SO QUICKLY ?

20:17.850 --> 20:19.579
I WAS THIRSTY.

20:21.150 --> 20:22.515
HERE.

20:22.620 --> 20:24.042
JUST HAVE SOME
OF MY MINE.

20:24.150 --> 20:26.539
I ASKED YOU IF YOU HAD WATER
EARLIER AND YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.186
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IF YOU KNEW,

20:28.290 --> 20:30.724
YOU WOULDN'T MAKE
YOUR WATER LAST AS LONG.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.399
LET'S TALK
ABOUT LUNCH.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.889
I ALWAYS GO TO THE INN
OF THE SEVENTH RAY.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.763
I'M GOING TO VISIT
MY ONLY SISTER.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.269
WHAT ?

20:41.370 --> 20:42.598
I DIDN'T REALIZE WE WERE
GONNA BE IN TOPANGA.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.304
SHE LIVES A FEW
MILES FROM HERE

20:44.410 --> 20:46.401
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN AGES
AND IT'S ONLY RIGHT.

20:46.510 --> 20:50.503
FAMILY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME
EVEN IF IT ISN'T TO YOU.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.314
JESUS.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.342
MOM IS HUNTING
FOR FOSSILS ?

20:56.450 --> 20:58.645
WHY WOULD A PERSON
HUNT FOR FOSSILS ?

20:58.750 --> 21:01.753
APPARENTLY, BECAUSE
THEIR HUSBAND DOES.

21:01.860 --> 21:02.815
THIS IS GREAT.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.956
I WAS GONNA ASK HER
TO BABY-SIT TONIGHT.

21:05.060 --> 21:06.948
I'M BUSY.

21:09.460 --> 21:11.064
SO YOU'RE OUT
A LOT LATELY.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.296
IS THIS
SOMETHING SERIOUS ?

21:12.400 --> 21:15.062
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

21:15.170 --> 21:17.434
MAILE'S JUST THIS GIRL THAT I
WORKED WITH AT DOGGIE DAY CARE.

21:17.540 --> 21:18.802
AT THE DOGGY DAY CARE.

21:18.910 --> 21:21.105
I'VE SEEN HER A FEW TIMES
BUT SHE'S JUST...

21:21.210 --> 21:22.700
JUST FUN.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.606
I THINK
IT'S REALLY WEIRD

21:25.710 --> 21:27.974
THAT YOU WORKED IN A DOG PLACE
FOR LIKE SIX SECONDS.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.377
YEAH, WELL...

21:29.480 --> 21:33.655
IT WASN'T EXACTLY MY DECISION
TO LEAVE, NOW IS IT ?

21:33.760 --> 21:36.251
UGH, PEOPLE WHO WRITE OP-ED
PIECES SHOULD BE SHOT.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.419
HEY, WHAT TIME
IS THE MOVIE TONIGHT ?

21:38.530 --> 21:42.318
ACTUALLY, I'M GOING
TO BE SEEING RUSSELL TONIGHT

21:42.430 --> 21:45.092
AND I PLAN ON STAYING OVER
AT HIS APARTMENT.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.794
IT'S PURELY
A PHYSICAL THING, BUT,

21:47.900 --> 21:52.064
SOMETHING REALLY INTENSE
I NEED TO EXPLORE.

21:52.170 --> 21:54.604
( laughing )

21:54.710 --> 21:57.304
HEY, CLAIRE IF YOU'RE
HAVING ANY EMOTIONS ABOUT IT,

21:57.410 --> 21:59.275
NOW IS A GOOD TIME
AS ANY TO EXPRESS THEM.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.245
NO, IT ISN'T.

22:01.350 --> 22:02.942
OH.

22:03.050 --> 22:05.610
LOOK, DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.086
SO IT'LL JUST BE
ME AND EDIE TONIGHT.

22:15.260 --> 22:17.467
I'M FINE.

22:19.630 --> 22:23.430
I'VE JUST BEEN WORKING ON
MRS. MORRISON FOR 110 YEARS.

22:24.470 --> 22:25.960
IT'S THE TUMOR LADY.

22:26.070 --> 22:29.107
HER BODY'S TOTALLY SHOT FROM
THE CHEMO AND THE RADIATION.

22:29.210 --> 22:30.939
SHE'S ALL CRUMBLY.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.518
HEY, EDIE AND I ARE
GOING TO THE MOVIES TONIGHT.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.871
IF YOU WANT TO JOIN.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.015
GIRLS NIGHT OUT ?

22:36.120 --> 22:37.940
I'M THERE, TOTALLY.

22:38.050 --> 22:42.555
* I'M A LONELY LI'ITLE
PETUNIA IN AN ONION PATCH *

22:42.660 --> 22:46.619
* AN ONN PATCH,
AN ONION PATCH *

22:46.730 --> 22:50.257
* I'M A LONELY LI'ITLE PETUNIA
IN AN ONION PATCH *

22:50.360 --> 22:54.160
* AND ALL I DO
IS CRY ALL DAY *

22:54.270 --> 22:56.932
* BOO H00 H00

22:57.040 --> 22:59.258
* BOO H00 H00

22:59.370 --> 23:01.304
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT ?

23:01.410 --> 23:03.674
MY MOTHER USED
TO SING THAT TO US.

23:03.780 --> 23:07.045
WELL, THAT
EXPLAINS A LOT.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.867
WHY IS IT THAT
WHEN YOU MOVE,

23:28.970 --> 23:30.608
YOU CAN NEVER FIND THE THINGS
THAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT ?

23:30.710 --> 23:32.564
YOU JUST FIND THE THINGS
THAT YOU REGRET BRINGING

23:32.670 --> 23:34.274
AND NOT JUST
THROWING AWAY.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.132
I NEVER HOLD
ONTO ANYTHING.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.502
SMART.

23:37.610 --> 23:39.305
YOU SHOULD
BE PROUD OF THAT.

23:39.410 --> 23:42.447
I'M THINKING ABOUT BUILDING SOME
SHELVES IN THE OTHER BEDROOM.

23:42.550 --> 23:45.849
THAT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE THINGS
YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW

23:45.950 --> 23:47.918
HOW TO DO IN ORDER
TO BE ABLE TO DO IT, RIGHT ?

23:48.020 --> 23:50.580
LET'S FINISH ALL THIS SE'ITLING
IN LATER AND WATCH BAD TV.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.578
OKAY.

23:52.690 --> 23:54.351
BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE
A DECISION AT SOME POINT.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.928
OFFICE ISN'T ALWAYS
GONNA BE AN OFFICE,

23:57.030 --> 23:59.191
IT'S GONNA BE
A NURSERY AS SOON AS...

23:59.300 --> 24:02.133
I MEAN, YOU MIGHT
ALREADY BE PREGNANT.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.367
OH, I'M NOT,
I GOT IT YESTERDAY.

24:04.470 --> 24:06.768
OH.

24:08.010 --> 24:09.500
SO THAT'S WHY
YOU LOOKED SO SAD

24:09.610 --> 24:11.805
WHEN YOU CAME HOME
LATE Al-TER CLASS.

24:15.750 --> 24:18.514
WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL ME ?

24:19.920 --> 24:21.615
I DON'T KNOW.

24:24.560 --> 24:28.792
WELL, LOOK, IT WAS ONLY
OUR FIRST TIME AT BAT.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.323
I MEAN, I'M SURE
THIS MONTH IT WILL HAPPEN.

24:31.430 --> 24:33.159
MAYBE IT'S
FOR THE BEST.

24:33.270 --> 24:34.669
YEAH, EXACTLY.

24:34.770 --> 24:36.362
WE GET ANOTHER MONTH WHERE
IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US.

24:36.470 --> 24:39.337
WE HAVE TO LEARN TO APPRECIATE
THOSE WHILE WE STILL HAVE THEM.

24:39.440 --> 24:40.930
YEAH.

24:44.950 --> 24:48.147
WELL, IT'S DEFINITELY
AN IMPROVEMENT.

24:48.250 --> 24:52.641
YET, THERE'S STILL SOMETHING
UNSATISFYING ABOUT THESE.

24:52.750 --> 24:57.016
DOES ANYONE
KNOW WHAT IT IS ?

24:57.120 --> 24:59.327
HMM ?

24:59.430 --> 25:01.591
TH EY'RE
TECH NICALLY GOOD.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.624
IT'S JUST
THAT THEY'RE...

25:05.570 --> 25:06.889
FINITE.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.093
ELISE, THAT IS
A BEAUTIFUL WAY TO PUT IT.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.065
THEY SHOW US
SOMETHING,

25:11.170 --> 25:14.571
BUT THEY DON'T LEAVE US
WITH ANYTHING TO PONDER.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.830
ALL EXCEPT...

25:16.940 --> 25:18.942
THIS ONE.

25:19.050 --> 25:23.168
CLAIRE, WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS PHOTOGRAPH IS SAYING ?

25:24.250 --> 25:26.480
UMM...

25:26.590 --> 25:29.457
IT'S ABOUT BEING
HALF HIDDEN ?

25:29.560 --> 25:32.358
AND WHAT IT MEANS
TO COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS ?

25:32.460 --> 25:34.690
THE WOMAN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH
LOOKS AT US,

25:34.800 --> 25:37.564
LIKE SHE WANTS US
TO COME CLOSER.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.888
BUT WE DON'T.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.265
SHE TEASES US,
ALMOST LIKE SHE'S DARING US.

25:43.370 --> 25:45.201
BUT WHAT
IS THE DARE ?

25:45.310 --> 25:46.629
IS IT TO TOUCH HER ?

25:46.740 --> 25:49.675
SHE LOOKS LIKE
SHE KNOWS WE'RE SCARED.

25:49.780 --> 25:52.499
BUT WHAT'S SO SCARY
ABOUT THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ?

25:52.610 --> 25:55.511
WHAT'S SO SCARY ABOUT
GE'ITING CLOSE TO SOMEONE ?

25:55.620 --> 26:00.614
BECAUSE WE DON'T QUITE KNOW THE
ANSWER TO ANY OF THE QUESTIONS,

26:00.720 --> 26:03.257
THE PHOTO HAUNTS US.

26:05.290 --> 26:07.690
NICE WORK, CLAIRE.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.496
DOES ANYONE ELSE
HAVE ANY COMMENTS ?

26:10.600 --> 26:11.521
YEAH.

26:11.630 --> 26:12.790
I'M REALLY
PISSED OFF.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.436
WHY IS THAT,
ELISE ?

26:14.540 --> 26:16.758
CLAIRE TAKES AN EROTIC PICTURE
OF HER BEAUTIFUL GIRLFRIEND

26:16.870 --> 26:19.509
AND SHE GETS AN "A" JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE A LESBIAN.

26:19.610 --> 26:21.305
THIS SUCKS.

26:21.410 --> 26:22.536
SHE'S NOT
MY GIRLFRIEND.

26:22.640 --> 26:23.607
GIVE ME A BREAK.

26:23.710 --> 26:24.938
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

26:25.050 --> 26:26.574
ANITA, TELL HER
SHE'S JUST MY FRIEND.

26:26.680 --> 26:29.410
SHE'S NOT
CLAIRE'S GIRLFRIEND.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.681
THAT I KNOW OF.

26:40.960 --> 26:41.858
( knocking )

26:41.960 --> 26:44.622
WHY ISN'T
SHE ANSWERING ?

26:46.530 --> 26:48.168
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYONE HERE.

26:48.270 --> 26:51.000
I SUPPOSE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:56.340 --> 26:58.046
OH, MY GOD.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.208
SARAH !

27:01.080 --> 27:02.877
(crying )

27:07.620 --> 27:09.087
HONEY ?

27:09.190 --> 27:11.351
RUTH ?

27:16.800 --> 27:19.360
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
FISHER.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.335
(crying )

27:21.440 --> 27:24.307
( laughing )

27:27.740 --> 27:29.605
I TELL THE CHILDREN
TO MAKE THE UGLIEST MONSTER

27:29.710 --> 27:31.109
THAT LIVES INSIDE THEM,

27:31.210 --> 27:33.144
AND THEN WE PUT THEIR
PICTURES ON THEM.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.911
THEY ARE
SORT OF UGLY.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.443
THIS ONE IS
REALLY HIDEOUS.

27:37.550 --> 27:38.539
THAT'S MINE.

27:38.650 --> 27:41.778
( laughing )

27:41.890 --> 27:44.029
I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL
THAT YOU'VE BECOME A TEACHER.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.724
PLEASE, I'M JUST THE CRAZY
ART LADY WHO COMES IN

27:46.830 --> 27:47.990
A FEW AFTERNOONS A WEEK.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.897
I DON'T HAVE ANY
ACTUAL CERTIFICATION

27:50.000 --> 27:51.763
SO THE PAY IS
PRE'ITY TERRIBLE.

27:51.870 --> 27:54.759
YES, BUT THE LAST
TIME I SAW YOU...

27:55.940 --> 27:59.307
I'M GLAD YOU PUT
YOUR LIFE TOGETHER.

27:59.410 --> 28:02.038
WOW, I HAD NO IDEA.

28:02.140 --> 28:05.143
GEORGE HAS JUST TOLD ME THE
ENTIRE HISTORY OF PAPER-MACHE.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.946
IT WAS FASCINATING.

28:08.050 --> 28:11.019
MAY I USE
YOUR BATHROOM ?

28:11.120 --> 28:14.055
OH, OF COURSE, LET ME
SHOW YOU WHERE IT IS.

28:15.660 --> 28:17.821
SO I LEI-T FIVE FUCKING
MESSAGES FOR YOU

28:17.930 --> 28:19.989
AFTER I CAME
BACK INTO TOWN.

28:20.090 --> 28:21.591
WHY HAVEN'T
YOU CALLED ME ?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.099
I DON'T KNOW.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.792
YOU LOOK FUNNY.

28:24.900 --> 28:27.118
I WAS DEHYDRATED
EARLIER.

28:27.230 --> 28:29.937
WELL, NOW THAT I HAVE YOU BACK,
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU GO.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.837
YOU HAVE TO STAY
FOR DINNER.

28:31.940 --> 28:33.908
I HAVE A MILLION
QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

28:34.010 --> 28:36.137
YOU MUST HAVE
A MILLION FOR ME.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.947
IT'S JUST I'VE BEEN HAVING
THIS FUNNY FEELING LATELY

28:39.050 --> 28:42.542
SO, THIS MORNING
I DECIDED TO FOLLOW HIM.

28:42.650 --> 28:43.912
THAT FUCKING BASTARD.

28:44.020 --> 28:45.544
I TOLD YOU HE WAS GONNA
DO THIS TO YOU ONE DAY.

28:45.650 --> 28:49.051
C'MON, MAYBE THERE'S A LOGICAL
EXPLANATION, MAYBE HE--

28:50.660 --> 28:52.525
OH MY GOD.

28:52.630 --> 28:54.689
WHAT IS IT,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

28:54.800 --> 28:56.654
RICO'S CHARITY
HAS A DOUBLE D.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.923
I WILL CUT
HIS BALLS OFF.

29:05.770 --> 29:07.704
I NEED YOU TAKE
THE BOYS TONIGHT.

29:07.810 --> 29:09.801
I NEED THE HOUSE TO BE EMPTY
WHEN I TALK TO HIM.

29:09.910 --> 29:11.571
I CAN'T, I'M GONNA
BE HERE FOR HOURS.

29:11.680 --> 29:14.114
THIS SHIT SHOW
HAS BEEN ON FOREVER

29:14.220 --> 29:16.108
AND NONE OF THE REGULARS
GIVE A FUCK ANYMORE.

29:16.220 --> 29:17.710
I could come by
tomorrow and get them.

29:17.820 --> 29:18.809
FINE.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.956
Are you gonna
be okay tonight ?

29:21.820 --> 29:23.879
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.295
What if there really
is a handsome prince ?

29:31.400 --> 29:32.924
SHE'S REALLY PRE'ITY.

29:34.900 --> 29:38.358
SHE'S GORGEOUS, BUT
IN A REALLY SUBTLE WAY.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.134
WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF HER ?

29:41.240 --> 29:43.606
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MAKES
A GIRL PRE'ITY OR NOT.

29:43.710 --> 29:45.348
I DON'T LOOK AT
GIRLS THAT WAY.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.977
WHEN YOU WERE LI'ITLE
YOU USED TO GO ON AND ON

29:49.080 --> 29:51.412
ABOUT HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU
THOUGHT JENNIFER ANISTON WAS.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.715
THAT'S BECAUSE I WAS JUST
PARROTING WHAT THE CULTURE

29:53.820 --> 29:55.515
WAS TELLING ME
TO THINK.

29:55.620 --> 29:57.053
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT,
I WAS 11.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.286
( male )
Do you love me ?

29:58.390 --> 29:59.584
( female )
Yes.

29:59.690 --> 30:01.999
Then I have
everything I need.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.161
If you make a noise,
I'll shoot.

30:12.340 --> 30:14.479
IF YOU EVEN BREATHE,
I WILL SHOOT YOU IN THE SPINE-

30:17.640 --> 30:19.904
I HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.045
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

30:22.150 --> 30:26.280
I FORGOT SOMETHING I HAVE
TO DO AT WORK WITH THE, UH...

30:26.390 --> 30:27.812
TUMOR LADY.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.411
EDIE, YOU GIVE CLAIRE
A RIDE HOME, OKAY ?

30:30.520 --> 30:32.556
( male )
Do you have any idea
what's it's like

30:32.660 --> 30:34.059
to see your life
fall apart ?

30:34.160 --> 30:36.890
( other male )
I understand.

30:40.470 --> 30:42.028
I'M JUST NERVOUS.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.108
IT'S MAYA'S FIRST NIGHT
WITH THE NEW SI'ITER.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.633
SHE SEEMS LIKE
A NICE GIRL.

30:46.740 --> 30:49.607
I USED TO BABY-SIT
WHEN I WAS A KID.

30:49.710 --> 30:52.543
I HOPE YOU HID ALL
YOUR PRIVATE PAPERS.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.948
YOU MEAN YOU USED TO SNOOP
AROUND PEOPLE'S PRIVATE THINGS ?

30:55.050 --> 30:56.244
ALL THE TIME.

30:56.350 --> 30:58.443
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
THE STUFF I FOUND.

30:58.550 --> 31:01.917
WHY DO THE UGLIEST PEOPLE ALWAYS
HAVE THE DIRTIEST PHOTOS ?

31:02.020 --> 31:03.453
I DON'T KNOW.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.653
ONE TIME...

31:05.760 --> 31:09.093
THIS WIDOW BROUGHT
IN THE GROSSEST PHOTO

31:09.200 --> 31:11.691
OF HER HUSBAND TO HELP
WITH THE EMBALMING.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.165
HE WAS--

31:13.270 --> 31:14.635
YOU WANT ME
TO DESCRIBE HIM ?

31:14.740 --> 31:16.367
PLEASE, DON'T.

31:19.940 --> 31:22.170
SO HOW'S IT
BEING BACK AT WORK ?

31:22.280 --> 31:24.942
IT'S THE SAME OLD,
SAME OLD.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.575
I'M JUST TRYING NOT
TO LET IT GET ME DOWN.

31:27.680 --> 31:28.874
RIGHT NOW,
IN MY OFF HOURS

31:28.980 --> 31:30.743
I'M CONCENTRATING
ON RELAXING AND HAVING FUN.

31:30.850 --> 31:32.215
REALLY.

31:32.320 --> 31:35.118
WHAT KIND OF THINGS
DO YOU LIKE TO DO ?

31:36.660 --> 31:39.026
SO I WOKE UP ONE MORNING
AND THE BASTARD WAS GONE.

31:39.130 --> 31:41.121
STOLE $5,000 FROM ME.

31:41.230 --> 31:42.788
AND SOME
TIFFANY LAMPS.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.458
BUT I HAD ALWAYS
HATED THOSE ANYWAY.

31:44.570 --> 31:45.719
OH DEAR.

31:45.830 --> 31:47.127
YOU MUST HAVE
BEEN SO DEPRESSED.

31:47.230 --> 31:49.460
THIS ONE,
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

31:49.570 --> 31:52.698
WE WENT TO TAOS THAT
NIGHT AND STAYED A WEEK.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.277
HAD A BLAST.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.598
JULIA ROBERTS
AND HER HUSBAND LIVE THERE.

31:56.710 --> 31:59.178
WE CHASED THEM AROUND TOWN
LIKE THEY WERE WILD BOARS.

31:59.280 --> 32:02.579
HOW WERE YOU
ABLE TO DO THAT ?

32:02.680 --> 32:04.238
OH, I FIGURE THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN SHOW EVERYBODY

32:04.350 --> 32:06.215
IS TO HAVE THE TIME
OF YOUR LIFE.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.982
GEORGE, LET'S HEAR
ALL ABOUT YOU.

32:09.090 --> 32:10.717
YOU SEEM
INTERESTING.

32:10.820 --> 32:12.151
YEAH.

32:12.260 --> 32:14.228
RUTH TELLS ME YOU HAD A SON
SENDING YOU BOXES OF SHIT.

32:14.330 --> 32:15.797
BE'ITINA.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.094
WHAT ?

32:17.200 --> 32:18.929
LIKE MY DAUGHTER
HASN'T DONE WORSE TO ME.

32:19.030 --> 32:22.431
COME ON, YOU WANT
TO COMPARE WAR STORIES ?

32:23.270 --> 32:25.534
ACTUALLY,
NO, I DON'T.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.131
DO YOU HAVE
A TELEVISION ?

32:28.240 --> 32:30.003
THERE'S A DOCUMENTARY
ON PBS I WOULDN'T MIND

32:30.110 --> 32:32.078
WATCHING A FEW
MINUTES OF.

32:32.580 --> 32:34.719
OH, SURE.

32:34.820 --> 32:39.245
THERE'S ONE IN THE OTHER ROOM,
UNDER THAT MESS IN THE CORNER.

32:47.930 --> 32:49.420
HAVING A HARD NIGHT ?

32:49.530 --> 32:50.599
UH...

32:50.700 --> 32:52.167
NO, I JUST...

32:52.270 --> 32:54.966
SAW SOME BAD
COMING ATTRACTIONS.

32:55.070 --> 32:57.197
THAT'S A NEW ONE.

32:58.710 --> 32:59.904
SO WHAT CAN
I GET FOR YOU ?

33:00.010 --> 33:01.932
VODKA GIMLET.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.234
REALLY ?

33:03.340 --> 33:05.444
YEAH, MY FATHER
USED TO DRINK THEM...

33:05.550 --> 33:07.802
WHEN HE WANTED
SOMETHING STRONG.

33:07.910 --> 33:10.071
VODKA GIMLET
COMING UP.

33:20.390 --> 33:21.994
( various voices )
LOOK AT THAT WIMP
OVER THERE.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.829
LET'S KICK
THE SHIT OUT OF HIM.

33:23.930 --> 33:25.067
NO, LET'S KILL HIM.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.319
WE COULD JUST
HIDE IN HIS CAR.

33:26.430 --> 33:27.966
IT WOULD
BE SO EASY.

33:28.070 --> 33:29.196
YOU WANT THIS ?

33:29.300 --> 33:33.339
THE KITCHEN MADE
AN EXTRA ORDER BY MISTAKE.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.002
I SEE YOU DON'T EAT
THAT MANY FRIED FOODS.

33:39.110 --> 33:40.600
NO, NOT SO MANY.

33:40.710 --> 33:45.738
AND SPEND A LITTLE TOO MUCH
ON CLOTHES I NOTICED TOO.

33:45.850 --> 33:47.943
MAYBE A BIT.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.984
AND YOU SHAVE WELL.

33:51.090 --> 33:55.550
NONE OF THE OTHER GUYS
SHAVE AS WELL AS YOU.

33:58.130 --> 33:59.062
OH, FUCK.

33:59.170 --> 34:00.467
I'M GONNA FUCKING
KILL JAVIER.

34:00.570 --> 34:03.459
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE GAY, BITCH ?

34:03.570 --> 34:05.538
( laughing )

34:05.640 --> 34:07.403
OH, CALM DOWN,
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO TOLD ME.

34:07.510 --> 34:09.239
JAVIER'S GOT ONE
BIG BLABBER-MOUTH.

34:09.340 --> 34:13.071
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE HE'S GOT
A REAL SERIOUS CRUSH ON YOU.

34:13.180 --> 34:15.216
COME ON,
HE'S MARRIED.

34:15.320 --> 34:18.118
JAVIER'S STRAIGHT,
ISN'T HE ?

34:22.790 --> 34:24.678
NEAL, I MET
ON MATCH.COM.

34:24.790 --> 34:26.257
THE TEACHER
I MET ON SALON.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.329
ARE THESE INTERNET
SITES SAFE ?

34:29.430 --> 34:31.660
DO THEY SCREEN
THESE MEN ?

34:31.770 --> 34:33.089
OF COURSE NOT,
THANK GOD.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.462
IF THERE WAS ANY
KIND OF SCREENING,

34:34.570 --> 34:36.128
NONE OF US WOULD
MAKE IT THROUGH, RIGHT ?

34:36.240 --> 34:38.663
( laughing )

34:38.770 --> 34:41.477
I REMEMBER I REALLY LIKED
"LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR'I

34:41.580 --> 34:43.502
WHEN IT CAME OUT.

34:46.050 --> 34:50.168
SO, IS HE NEVER
COMING IN TO DINNER ?

34:50.280 --> 34:52.419
GEORGE GETS VERY
CAUGHT UP SOMETIMES.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.215
HE'S A VERY
FOCUSED PERSON.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.788
IT'S A SHOW ABOUT
THE ELGIN MARBLES.

34:56.890 --> 34:59.188
I MEAN, HOW CAUGHT UP
CAN HE BE ?

34:59.290 --> 35:02.657
SO, TELL ME ABOUT
THE ONE YOU'RE SEEING NOW.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.364
HIS NAME IS BERNIE.

35:04.470 --> 35:08.634
AND HE'S A FREELANCE EDITOR,
AND HE HAS A CAT.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.492
HE'S NICE.

35:10.600 --> 35:11.669
HE'S A LOSER.

35:11.770 --> 35:13.328
STOP THAT, HE'S SOMEONE
TO DO THINGS WITH.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.931
LISTEN, IF ALL
YOU CAN SAY ABOUT A GUY

35:16.040 --> 35:17.473
IS THAT HE'S SOMEONE
TO DO THINGS WITH,

35:17.580 --> 35:20.174
THEN THAT'S WORSE
THAN BEING ALONE.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.510
WELL, I LIKE HIM,
SO SHUT UP.

35:24.520 --> 35:27.341
I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD
BE GETTING HOME.

35:27.450 --> 35:29.350
GEORGE DRIVES REALLY
SLOWLY AT NIGHT

35:29.460 --> 35:32.281
AND HE DOESN'T LIKE ME TO TALK
SO HE CAN CONCENTRATE.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.819
IF YOU WANT,
YOU CAN STAY HERE.

35:35.930 --> 35:37.591
THE BED'S PRETTY BAD

35:37.700 --> 35:39.918
AND THE GUEST ROOM HAS
A STRANGE SMELL--

35:40.030 --> 35:41.395
WE'LL TAKE IT.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.593
WELL, YOU CAN HAVE
SOME MORE WINE THEN.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.304
AND THEN BAM,
THE LADY WAS DEAD

35:45.410 --> 35:47.298
BECAUSE SHE LET
THE TUMOR GET SO BIG.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.174
ARE YOU
LISTENING TO ME ?

35:50.280 --> 35:51.838
OF COURSE
I'M LISTENING.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.474
"... AND THEN BAM,
THE LADY WAS DEAD.

35:53.580 --> 35:54.877
BECAUSE SHE LET
THE TUMOR GET SO BIG."

35:54.980 --> 35:56.572
CAN YOU IMAGINE ?

35:56.680 --> 35:59.581
HAVING SOMETHING HORRIBLE
JUST GROWING INSIDE YOU ?

35:59.690 --> 36:02.716
SOMETHING TERRIBLE JUST
EATING AWAY AT YOUR INSIDES ?

36:03.920 --> 36:07.378
YES, ACTUALLY,
I CAN.

36:11.900 --> 36:15.836
( loud chattering )

36:29.980 --> 36:32.778
OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS SO DIRTY.

36:32.890 --> 36:36.348
( laughing )

36:36.460 --> 36:39.588
BUT WHAT WITH YOUR ROOMMATES
AND MAYA, I JUST FIGURED...

36:41.230 --> 36:42.527
IT'S NOT THAT DIRTY.

36:42.630 --> 36:44.291
I'M SURE THEY CLEAN IT
ONCE IN A WHILE.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.119
NO, I MEANT THIS...

36:47.230 --> 36:49.835
THIS IS SO DIRTY.

36:53.870 --> 36:55.906
( laughing )

36:59.510 --> 37:02.149
AH, I'LL TAKE
ONE MORE FOR THE ROAD.

37:02.250 --> 37:03.979
SORRY, BUDDY,
WE'RE CLOSING.

37:04.650 --> 37:06.948
OH.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.586
SHIT.

37:41.090 --> 37:42.751
I CAN'T DO THIS.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.850
WHAT HAPPENED ?

37:47.090 --> 37:48.990
YOU WERE, LIKE,
IN HEAT BEFORE--

37:49.100 --> 37:50.158
I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T !

37:50.260 --> 37:51.761
I CAN'T.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.666
GOD, WHY DO I ALWAYS
PICK THE CRAZIES ?

38:04.910 --> 38:06.377
( chatter and music )

38:06.480 --> 38:08.311
SHE'S IN
A BETTER MOOD.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.344
YEAH, NO GAY CLUBS
TONIGHT.

38:11.450 --> 38:14.715
OH, HEY, SOMEONE
CALLED FOR YOU

38:14.820 --> 38:17.550
ON THE STAGE PHONE
WHEN YOU WAS IN THE CAN.

38:19.490 --> 38:22.698
"HIGWOOD JAY-BLOAM" ?

38:22.800 --> 38:24.597
I DON'T KNOW
A HIGWOOD JAY-BLOAM ?

38:24.700 --> 38:26.258
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND RIGHT.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.224
LOOK AT IT AGAIN.

38:28.340 --> 38:31.764
HIGWOOD JAY-BLOAM,
DON'T KNOW HIM.

38:31.870 --> 38:34.259
NO, THAT'S NOT A "G",
THAT'S A "Y".

38:34.380 --> 38:36.598
AND THAT'S AN "E",
NOT AN "I".

38:36.710 --> 38:38.746
OH, HEYWOOD.

38:38.850 --> 38:42.411
I DON'T KNOW A HEYWOOD
JAY-BLOAM EITHER.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.169
THAT'S NOT
HOW HE SAID IT.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.247
LET ME SEE.

38:45.350 --> 38:47.716
J-A-B-L-O-M-E.

38:47.820 --> 38:49.117
JA-BLOW-ME.

38:49.220 --> 38:50.653
I DON'T KNOW
THIS PERSON.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.057
WELL, SAY HIS NAME RIGHT,
MAYBE YOU DO.

38:52.160 --> 38:52.979
OKAY, OKAY.

38:53.090 --> 38:54.159
HEYWOOD JABLOME.

38:54.260 --> 38:55.625
HEYWOOD JABLOME.

38:55.730 --> 38:56.992
( laughing )

38:57.100 --> 38:58.624
WHAT'S SO
FUCKING FUNNY ?

38:58.730 --> 38:59.389
SAY IT AGAIN.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.899
HEYWOOD JABLOME.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.797
SURE, I'D BLOW YOU, K.

39:04.870 --> 39:07.509
( laughing )

39:18.890 --> 39:26.626
* OH, I'M A LONELY LITTLE
PETUNIA IN AN ONION PATCH *

39:26.730 --> 39:32.293
* AND ALL I DO
IS CRY ALL DAY *

39:32.400 --> 39:34.265
SHE SEEMS SWEET.

39:34.370 --> 39:36.691
YOU TWO WOULD
MAKE A LOVELY COUPLE.

39:36.800 --> 39:40.406
WELL, SHE'S JUST SOMEBODY
TO HAVE FUN WITH...

39:40.510 --> 39:43.070
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
THAT MUCH OF A CONNECTION.

39:47.910 --> 39:49.775
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU WON'T
LET THERE BE ONE.

39:49.880 --> 39:52.212
NATE, MAKE
A CONNECTION WITH HER.

39:52.320 --> 39:56.017
NAH, SHE'S NOT READY
TO SETTLE DOWN.

39:58.660 --> 40:01.424
NOW YOU, YOU WERE
READY TO SETTLE DOWN.

40:01.530 --> 40:03.521
I'LL SAY.

40:03.630 --> 40:05.222
BUT I THINK YOU TWO
COULD GET TOGETHER

40:05.330 --> 40:06.968
AND HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL LIFE.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.604
YOU CAN HAVE THE LIFE
WITH HER YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME.

40:12.710 --> 40:14.905
I GAVE YOU EVERYTHING
I HAD, LIS.

40:15.010 --> 40:17.035
RIGHT.

40:21.310 --> 40:23.073
HERE'S MY ADVICE
TO YOU,

40:23.180 --> 40:24.738
STOP WITH
THE CHEAP MOTELS,

40:24.850 --> 40:26.579
STOP SLEEPING
WITH THE CRAZY EX,

40:26.690 --> 40:28.612
AND TRY TO HAVE A REAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS ONE.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.654
WHAT'S STOPPING YOU ?

40:31.560 --> 40:32.686
THE PAIN.

40:32.790 --> 40:35.759
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?

40:35.860 --> 40:39.489
I CAN'T EVER AGAIN GO THROUGH
THE PAIN OF STARTING A LIFE

40:39.600 --> 40:43.036
WITH SOMEONE, ON TO HAVE IT
TAKEN AWAY FROM ME.

40:43.140 --> 40:45.506
OH, PLEASE.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.339
OUCH, THAT HURT !

40:47.440 --> 40:50.603
LIFE IS PAIN,
GET USED TO IT.

41:04.220 --> 41:06.324
ALRIGHT, SO,
I GUESS THAT'S IT.

41:06.430 --> 41:08.990
HERE WE ARE.

41:23.540 --> 41:26.475
CLAIRE, WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE ?

41:31.350 --> 41:32.681
I DON'T KNOW.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.816
I FEEL LIKE MAYBE
YOU'RE INTO ME,

41:36.920 --> 41:40.754
BUT YOU'RE JUST
CONFUSED, RIGHT ?

41:42.560 --> 41:44.721
BECAUSE I COULD
BE INTO YOU.

41:44.830 --> 41:48.163
IF I KNEW YOU WERE
INTO ME, YOU KNOW ?

41:50.600 --> 41:53.034
SO, I'LL NEED YOU
TO SAY IT.

42:03.050 --> 42:05.041
I CAN'T SAY IT.

42:07.550 --> 42:09.279
OKAY, LOOK,
THIS IS WHAT I KNOW.

42:09.390 --> 42:11.483
IT'S LIKE,
YOU REALLY INSPIRE ME.

42:11.590 --> 42:14.423
I WANT TO BE
WITH YOU ALL THE TIME.

42:14.530 --> 42:17.829
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
THIS REALLY SPECIAL PERSON

42:17.930 --> 42:21.388
WHO MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
I AM MORE SPECIAL.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.365
OKAY, THAT SOUNDED
REALLY STUPID.

42:23.470 --> 42:25.529
NO, IT DIDN'T.

42:37.920 --> 42:39.444
THIS ISN'T--

42:39.550 --> 42:41.780
I'M SORRY.

42:57.370 --> 43:00.965
( cell phone
vibrating )

43:02.810 --> 43:03.708
HI.

43:03.810 --> 43:05.869
Hey, soldier,
just checking in.

43:05.980 --> 43:08.448
BREN, CAN WE HAVE
AN HONEST CONVERSATION ?

43:08.550 --> 43:10.279
OH, FUCK.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.587
I'm sorry, it's just,
one of us has to wake up here.

43:12.690 --> 43:14.851
THIS ISN'T GOOD FOR YOU,
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.554
THIS IS
KEEPING US FROM...

43:17.660 --> 43:19.651
REALLY HAVING
ANYTHING GOOD.

43:19.760 --> 43:21.523
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?

43:21.630 --> 43:22.949
WE DESERVE
TO BE HAPPY.

43:23.060 --> 43:26.689
From everything you say,
Joe seems like a good guy.

43:26.800 --> 43:31.339
A little weird,
but then again, so are you.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.465
Give him a chance.

43:33.570 --> 43:35.834
Go be with him,
really be with him.

43:35.940 --> 43:38.431
Give yourself
a chance to be happy.

43:38.540 --> 43:41.441
WHAT IF
IT'S TOO LATE ?

43:41.550 --> 43:42.972
IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE.

43:43.080 --> 43:44.513
MAYBE YOU CAN JUST
TRY TELLING HIM THE TRUTH.

43:44.620 --> 43:45.644
WHAT WE'VE
BEEN DOING,

43:45.750 --> 43:47.911
AND THEN SEE
WHERE THAT GOES.

43:48.020 --> 43:51.581
THAT DIDN'T WORK SO WELL
WHEN I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

43:51.690 --> 43:55.353
WELL, MAYBE HE'S MORE
MATURE THAN I WAS THEN.

43:56.360 --> 43:58.669
HOLD ON A SEC.

43:58.770 --> 44:01.364
WHY AREN'T YOU
WATCHING THE FUNERAL ?

44:01.470 --> 44:03.335
THESE THINGS
RUN THEMSELVES.

44:04.340 --> 44:05.409
AND WHERE'S DAVID ?

44:05.510 --> 44:06.659
NOW HE DOESN'T EVEN
SHOW UP TO CLEAN ?

44:06.770 --> 44:07.634
HE WASN'T FEELING
WELL THIS MORNING.

44:07.740 --> 44:09.002
I TOLD HIM
TO STAY AT HOME.

44:15.380 --> 44:18.247
I'M WORKING,
I SHOULD GO.

44:18.350 --> 44:19.908
UM, GOOD LUCK.

44:20.020 --> 44:21.817
OKAY, BYE.

44:29.460 --> 44:31.291
GEORGE SEEMS
NICE, RUTH.

44:31.400 --> 44:34.096
HE REMINDS ME
OF SOMEONE.

44:36.040 --> 44:37.462
NATHANIEL.

44:37.570 --> 44:38.935
YOU MUST BE JOKING,
THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.975
GEORGE IS SO ACADEMIC
AND NATHANIEL WAS SO...

44:42.080 --> 44:43.809
NATHANIEL.

44:43.910 --> 44:46.174
THAT JOVIAL NATURE
MASKING SOMETHING ELSE.

44:46.280 --> 44:48.578
OH, THAT.

44:48.680 --> 44:50.511
THEIR INTENSE
PRIVATENESS.

44:50.620 --> 44:52.542
THAT NEED
TO WITHDRAW.

44:52.650 --> 44:54.754
MAYBE IT'S TRUE
WHAT THEY SAY.

44:54.860 --> 44:58.557
WE ALL PICK THE SAME PERSON
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

44:58.660 --> 45:00.821
THERE'S SOMETHING
NICE ABOUT THAT.

45:02.360 --> 45:03.793
HEY, LET'S MOVE IT.

45:03.900 --> 45:06.528
WE BETTER GET A MOVE ON
OR WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

45:06.630 --> 45:08.359
OKAY, GREAT.

45:10.470 --> 45:12.904
WE FEED BREAKFAST BURRITOS
TO THE HOMELESS TWICE A WEEK.

45:13.010 --> 45:15.331
BREAKFAST BURRITOS ON TOP
OF EVERYTHING ELSE ?

45:15.440 --> 45:16.873
OH MY GOODNESS.

45:16.980 --> 45:19.847
THE TEACHING, THE DATING,
CHASING JULIA ROBERTS

45:19.950 --> 45:21.474
LIKE A WILD BOAR...

45:21.580 --> 45:23.013
HOW DO YOU DO IT ?

45:23.120 --> 45:24.348
RUTH...

45:25.950 --> 45:30.387
MAYBE YOU WANT TO BE
GETTING OUT A LITTLE MORE.

45:30.490 --> 45:32.549
IT'S SO MUCH HARDER TO DO
THINGS WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED.

45:32.660 --> 45:34.355
I HEAR YOU.

45:34.460 --> 45:37.395
IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO HAVE A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP

45:37.500 --> 45:41.061
AND NOT SUBSUME MYSELF.

45:41.170 --> 45:42.990
I WONDER WHY.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.002
MOM.

45:46.110 --> 45:48.101
MAYBE THAT'S
OUR LEGACY.

45:49.180 --> 45:51.273
BUT MAYBE IT
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.

46:00.550 --> 46:01.539
HEY.

46:01.650 --> 46:03.254
HEY.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.149
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

46:11.260 --> 46:12.796
NOTHING.

46:16.040 --> 46:17.632
OH, IT'S JUST
THIS REALLY SAD STORY

46:17.740 --> 46:19.264
ABOUT THIS MAN
WHOSE WIFE LEI-T HIM

46:19.370 --> 46:22.134
BECAUSE... HE COULDN'T
CONTROL HIS EATING.

46:22.240 --> 46:25.209
AND NOTHING THE THERAPIST
OR ANYBODY DID COULD GET HIM

46:25.310 --> 46:27.801
TO STOP EATING,
SO, SHE LEI-T HIM

46:27.910 --> 46:31.846
AND HE HAD A HEART
ATTACK AND... DIED.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.720
IS THIS YOUR WAY OF
TELLING ME THAT I NEED

46:37.820 --> 46:40.357
TO CUT DOWN
ON MY SNACKS ?

46:43.130 --> 46:45.360
I'VE DONE
SOMETHING BAD.

46:49.900 --> 46:52.209
I THINK I'VE BEEN...

46:52.310 --> 46:57.475
REALLY, REALLY SCARED
ABOUT MY FEELINGS FOR YOU,

46:57.580 --> 47:03.177
AND IT'S CAUSED ME
TO ACT OUT IN...

47:04.220 --> 47:06.211
OLD AND FAMILIAR PATTERNS--

47:06.320 --> 47:08.049
JUST SAY IT.

47:11.720 --> 47:14.086
I SLEPT
WITH SOMEONE.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.427
A FEW TIMES.

47:21.130 --> 47:26.466
THIS IS MY PROBLEM THAT
I AM OBVIOUSLY CONTINUING

47:26.570 --> 47:28.265
TO STRUGGLE WITH.

47:29.310 --> 47:31.369
IT'S NOT YOU.

47:39.620 --> 47:41.042
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ?

47:41.150 --> 47:42.879
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

47:44.290 --> 47:46.349
I'M THINKING...

47:49.430 --> 47:51.352
I AM SO FUCKED.

47:51.460 --> 47:53.894
I NEVER LIKED ANYONE
AS MUCH AS YOU,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.730
AND I'M NEVER GOING TO
LIKE ANYONE AS MUCH AGAIN.

47:56.840 --> 47:58.467
SO...

48:02.680 --> 48:03.977
THAT'S IT.

48:04.080 --> 48:07.072
IT'S OVER
AND THIS SUCKS.

48:07.180 --> 48:10.308
IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE OVER.

48:10.420 --> 48:12.684
IT COULD BE LIKE...

48:12.790 --> 48:14.018
A NEW BEGINNING.

48:14.120 --> 48:16.179
DO I KNOW
THIS PERSON ?

48:16.720 --> 48:18.381
NO.

48:26.470 --> 48:31.533
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT
BEING LIKE A BEGINNING ?

48:33.870 --> 48:35.633
NOT MUCH.

48:39.180 --> 48:41.341
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT ALL MEANS ?

48:41.450 --> 48:42.542
Okay.

48:42.650 --> 48:44.538
HEY, WOULD YA
BLOW ME ?

48:44.650 --> 48:46.618
HEY, WOULD YA
BLOW ME ?

48:46.720 --> 48:48.142
THIS IS
A TOUGH ONE.

48:48.250 --> 48:51.549
NOW, THE OBVIOUS ANSWER IS
THAT HE WANTED TO BLOW ME.

48:51.660 --> 48:52.957
Sure.

48:53.060 --> 48:56.393
I MEAN, FREUD WOULD SAY
THAT ON SOME LEVEL HE WANTED

48:56.500 --> 48:58.855
TO BLOW ME WHETHER
HE KNOWS IT OR NOT.

48:58.970 --> 49:01.222
I DON'T RECALL
FREUD'S POSITION

49:01.330 --> 49:03.890
ON THE HEYWOOD JABLOME
PHONY PHONE MESSAGE.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.729
But how would I know
if he's conscious of

49:05.840 --> 49:07.705
wanting to blow me
or not ?

49:07.810 --> 49:09.368
That is
the question.

49:09.480 --> 49:12.404
IT IS AND IT IS
AN IMPORTANT ONE.

49:12.510 --> 49:18.176
I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS I COULD
MAKE SOME SORT OF PASS AT HIM.

49:18.280 --> 49:20.748
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO ?

49:20.850 --> 49:23.159
( sighing )

49:24.860 --> 49:26.418
Are you still there ?

49:26.530 --> 49:28.851
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

49:28.960 --> 49:30.154
WHAT ?

49:30.260 --> 49:33.093
Us, this, having sex
with other people.

49:35.140 --> 49:37.631
YOU KNOW, WE SAID IF ONE OF US
WAS EVER UNCOMFORTABLE,

49:37.740 --> 49:38.764
WE COULD
STOP DOING IT.

49:38.870 --> 49:40.201
I WANT US
TO STOP DOING IT.

49:40.310 --> 49:42.528
UH, I DON'T
REMEMBER THAT RULE.

49:42.640 --> 49:44.505
(crying )

49:44.610 --> 49:46.373
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

49:46.480 --> 49:48.744
OH, KEITH.

49:48.850 --> 49:50.613
WHY DID THIS
HAPPEN TO ME ?

49:52.290 --> 49:54.884
WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE
TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN TO ME ?

49:54.990 --> 49:56.287
NOTHING.

49:56.390 --> 49:58.278
(crying )

49:59.060 --> 50:00.925
LET IT OUT.

50:01.030 --> 50:03.658
I'M HERE.

50:04.860 --> 50:06.999
You're gonna
be okay.

50:08.470 --> 50:10.097
I'm here.

50:13.070 --> 50:14.435
( door closing )

50:20.710 --> 50:22.644
WHERE ARE
THE KIDS ?

50:22.750 --> 50:24.718
RICO, I KNOW

50:26.250 --> 50:28.241

50:30.820 --> 50:33.186

YOU CALL HER.

50:33.290 --> 50:35.656

50:38.930 --> 50:42.161
I'VE DONE
NOTHING WRONG.

50:42.270 --> 50:44.135
I KNOW YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH THIS PERSON.

50:44.240 --> 50:46.128
I'M NOT
SLEEPING WITH HER.

50:46.240 --> 50:48.868
I TOLD YOU, I'M JUST
HELPING SOPHIA.

50:48.970 --> 50:50.335

50:50.440 --> 50:54.149
I DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE HAPPENING.

50:54.250 --> 50:56.377
BUT NOTHING

50:56.480 --> 50:58.016

51:27.250 --> 51:29.411
I DO UNDERSTAND THIS.

51:29.520 --> 51:32.341
I UNDERSTAND IT A WHOLE
LOT BETTER THAN YOU DO.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.312
( door slamming )

51:42.960 --> 51:45.121

52:01.910 --> 52:04.413
I REALLY NEED YOU.

52:05.020 --> 52:07.341
( laughing )

52:07.450 --> 52:09.657
YOU LEI-T YOUR WALLET

52:09.760 --> 52:11.955
OH MY GOD,

52:12.060 --> 52:14.426
I THOUGHT I LOST IT
THIS MORNING.

52:14.530 --> 52:19.923
YOU KNOW MAYBE ON
SOME UNCONSCIOUS LEVEL,

52:20.030 --> 52:21.361
YOU LEI-T IT BECAUSE--

52:21.470 --> 52:24.837
OKAY, FINE,

52:24.940 --> 52:26.908
LET'S JUST
SLEEP TOGETHER.

52:27.740 --> 52:30.129
NOW ?

52:30.240 --> 52:32.674
IN A SEC, I NEED
TO BRUSH MY TEETH.

52:36.680 --> 52:40.138
LAST NIGHT, IT SEEMED LIKE
THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU WANT.

52:40.250 --> 52:42.559
IT ISN'T.

52:45.590 --> 52:47.729
BUT COME ON,
GET UNDRESSED, LET'S GO.

52:48.690 --> 52:51.022
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S CHANGED.

52:51.130 --> 52:52.893
HOLD ON.

53:03.910 --> 53:05.548
NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

53:07.510 --> 53:09.102
PART OF ME THINKS
THIS IS WHAT I WANT

53:09.220 --> 53:11.643
AND PART OF ME
THINKS IT ISN'T.

53:11.750 --> 53:13.217
BUT...

53:13.320 --> 53:15.049
WHAT IF THE PART OF ME
WHO THINKS IT ISN'T

53:15.150 --> 53:17.653
FEELS THAT WAY
BECAUSE I'M SCARED ?

53:21.360 --> 53:23.225
AND AFTER ALL,
I DO OWE YOU ONE.

53:24.800 --> 53:27.860
( laughing )

53:30.200 --> 53:32.907
ALRIGHT, YOU'RE ON.

53:35.880 --> 53:37.529
( laughing )

53:37.640 --> 53:39.039
GO AWAY, RICO.

53:39.140 --> 53:40.448
JUST LET ME TALK
TO YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES.

53:40.550 --> 53:42.415
PLEASE JUST
LET ME IN.

53:42.520 --> 53:43.919
WHY ?

53:44.020 --> 53:45.817
PLEASE.

53:47.020 --> 53:50.649
( moaning )

53:59.030 --> 54:01.260
OH, I FELL DOWN !

54:02.070 --> 54:03.196
( baby laughing )

54:03.300 --> 54:04.335
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

54:04.440 --> 54:07.238
MAYBE YOU
AND ME AND MAILE

54:07.340 --> 54:09.160
WILL DO SOMETHING
FUN THIS SATURDAY.

54:09.280 --> 54:10.372
WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THAT ?

54:10.480 --> 54:11.504
OH, I FELL DOWN !

54:11.610 --> 54:12.804
HUH ?

54:12.910 --> 54:13.899
SHE HAS TWO DOGS.

54:14.010 --> 54:15.671
YOU LOVE DOGGIES,
RIGHT ?

54:15.780 --> 54:16.917
HELLO !

54:17.020 --> 54:20.808
OH, MAN, I CAN'T WAIT
TILL YOU START TALKING.

54:22.090 --> 54:23.785
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING ?

54:25.190 --> 54:27.329
I'M CALLING MAILE.

54:27.430 --> 54:28.886
I'M DOING
WHAT YOU SAID.

54:28.990 --> 54:30.491
TRYING TO START
A RELATIONSHIP.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.124
WITH THAT GIRL,
ARE YOU CRAZY ?

54:32.230 --> 54:33.663
THAT'LL NEVER TURN
INTO ANYTHING SERIOUS.

54:33.770 --> 54:35.761
BUT LAST NIGHT
YOU TOLD ME THAT--

54:35.870 --> 54:36.894
I WAS DESPERATE.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.991
I AM SO FUCKING SCARED
THAT YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK

54:39.100 --> 54:41.136
TO BRENDA THAT I'LL DO
OR SAY ANYTHING TO STOP IT.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.878
IF YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH BRENDA,

54:42.980 --> 54:44.470
THEN I'LL
REALLY BE DEAD.

54:44.580 --> 54:46.878
BRENDA'S JUST SLEEPING WITH ME
BECAUSE SHE REALLY LOVES JOE.

54:48.010 --> 54:49.511
THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES.

54:49.620 --> 54:52.077
NO, IT'S DIFFERENT
THIS TIME.

54:52.180 --> 54:54.341
YOU LOVE HER
AND SHE LOVES YOU.

54:54.450 --> 54:57.453
AND YOU SHOULD BE WITH HER
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

54:59.590 --> 55:01.558
THIS IS GIVING ME
A REALLY BAD FEELING.

55:01.660 --> 55:03.093
UH-OH.

55:03.200 --> 55:04.792
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D CHECK THAT OUT.

55:04.900 --> 55:06.765
IT MIGHT BE A TUMOR.

55:06.870 --> 55:09.020
( laughing )

55:11.200 --> 55:14.465
( tv chatter )

55:20.910 --> 55:26.610
* I'M A LONELY LITTLE
PETUNIA IN AN ONION PATCH *

55:26.720 --> 55:33.182
