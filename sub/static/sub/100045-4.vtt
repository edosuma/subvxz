17:50.750 --> 17:53.210
But that was
a dead end.

17:53.210 --> 17:56.540
And then...I took
to the potter's wheel.

17:56.540 --> 17:59.210
Okay, Bow, when did you
fall in love with medicine?

17:59.210 --> 18:00.830
That was after
my crocheting phase.

18:00.830 --> 18:01.830
Took me a while.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.540
Don't worry.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.250
Jack will find
his thing.
Yeah.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.790
Speaking from
personal experience,

18:07.790 --> 18:09.330
I hope it's not poetry.
Huh.

18:09.330 --> 18:11.250
This fool was rhyming "sandwich"
with "Manwich,"

18:11.250 --> 18:12.420
like they're not
the same thing.

18:12.420 --> 18:13.790
Eh --

18:13.790 --> 18:16.330
They're not the same.
Anyway.

18:16.330 --> 18:18.790
Look, if you bothered
to read the entire poem,

18:18.790 --> 18:21.040
you would see that
it was about apartheid!

18:21.040 --> 18:24.750
The bread is society,
and the sauce is the injustice!

18:24.750 --> 18:27.210
[ Door closes ]
I can never do nothing!

18:30.620 --> 18:32.580
Hey, if you want,
I'm pretty sure

18:32.580 --> 18:35.170
I can poison the coach
and most of the team.

18:35.170 --> 18:37.290
How's that sound, buddy?
A little poison?

18:37.290 --> 18:39.250
Just a little poison
for the team?

18:39.250 --> 18:40.790
[ Sighs ]
No, thanks.

18:40.790 --> 18:42.290
Don't feel bad, man.

18:42.290 --> 18:44.830
You just got caught up
in our quick-fix society.

18:44.830 --> 18:47.250
You struggling in school?
There's a pill for that.

18:47.250 --> 18:49.210
You feeling sad?
There's a pill for that.

18:49.210 --> 18:50.920
Having trouble growing
your mustache?

18:50.920 --> 18:51.830
There's a pill for that.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.540
Okay, it's a cream.

18:53.540 --> 18:55.460
And for the record,
it doesn't even work.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.330
Hey, guys.

18:57.330 --> 18:59.120
We need to talk to Jack
for a second.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.670
Okay.
Don't forget, Jack --

19:01.670 --> 19:04.000
If you want revenge,
there's a pill for that, too.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.330
What?
Oh. Alright.

19:05.330 --> 19:06.790
[ Sighs ] If you guys are up
here to make me feel better,

19:06.790 --> 19:08.500
it's not gonna happen.

19:08.500 --> 19:12.420
We understand that we can't
make you feel better, but...

19:12.420 --> 19:13.710
we know what you're
going through.

19:13.710 --> 19:15.250
Yeah.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.880
We've lost dreams, too.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.830
Mm-hmm.
And it hurts, right?

19:18.830 --> 19:19.960
Yeah, it sucks.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.290
Yeah.
Hold on to that.

19:22.290 --> 19:23.380
What?

19:23.380 --> 19:27.580
Use that pain
to fuel your next dream.

19:27.580 --> 19:30.000
And you're gonna figure out
what the next thing is.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.540
I mean, maybe --
maybe it's art.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.830
Could be.

19:34.830 --> 19:36.880
Or maybe it's science.
Or running.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.460
Oh.
You quick.

19:38.460 --> 19:39.750
[ Chuckles ]

19:39.750 --> 19:41.750
And once you figure it out,
go all in.

19:41.750 --> 19:43.380
You know, it's weird.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.250
I've been into basketball
for so long,

19:45.250 --> 19:46.920
I've -- I've never
had the chance

19:46.920 --> 19:48.620
to think about
what else I'm into.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.460
Yeah.
And we'll help you, too.

19:50.460 --> 19:51.290
Mm-hmm.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.250
Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, Dad.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.500
Alright.
Alright, sweetie.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.040
Hey, let's go downstairs,
get something to eat,

19:56.040 --> 19:57.170
and let's
talk about this.

19:57.170 --> 20:00.210
Okay. Hey, I-I-I really
love cooking.

20:00.210 --> 20:01.620
Maybe I could be
a chef.

20:01.620 --> 20:03.420
Hey.
There you go.

20:03.420 --> 20:06.080
And drawing's pretty cool.
I could be a comic book artist.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.920
Yes, you totally could.
Oh. Mm-hmm.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.540
And I've always
loved swords.

20:09.540 --> 20:10.960
Absolutely no swords.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.080
What?
No -- No swor--

20:13.080 --> 20:14.790
We --

20:14.790 --> 20:16.830
We can
look into s-swords.

20:16.830 --> 20:18.420
Thank you.
Yep.

20:18.420 --> 20:20.540
[ Sighs ]
Um...

20:20.540 --> 20:23.040
Look here, if you want
to be a sword guy,

20:23.040 --> 20:25.830
you can be the best damn
sword guy the world's ever seen.

20:25.830 --> 20:27.920
Is there an NBA
for swords?

20:27.920 --> 20:29.380
I don't know.

20:29.380 --> 20:31.710
If there isn't,
we'll start one.

20:31.710 --> 20:34.330
I hear LaVar Ball is always
looking for new opportunities.

20:34.330 --> 20:35.080
[ Chuckles ]

20:38.330 --> 20:40.420
So, what do you think?

20:40.420 --> 20:42.080
Is poetry something
you might want to do?

20:42.080 --> 20:43.330
Uh, I don't know.

20:43.330 --> 20:45.920
These poems
are kind of...offensive.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.420
What? Why?

20:48.420 --> 20:51.540
Well, I-I think most of them
are about butts.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.000
Mm.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.290
But the worst is the one
that compares the struggle

20:55.290 --> 20:58.250
of apartheid in South Africa
to a sloppy joe.

20:58.250 --> 21:02.250
Son, the bread is society,
and the sauce is injustice.

21:02.250 --> 21:04.290
How can you
not see that?

21:05.790 --> 21:08.750
So, is the hamburger meat
White people or Black people?

21:10.920 --> 21:13.460
You don't get poetry.

21:13.460 --> 21:15.170
Find your own
damn thing.
