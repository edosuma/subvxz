00:01.392 --> 00:02.959
Previously onSupergirl...

00:03.003 --> 00:05.135
With Obsidian Platinum,

00:05.179 --> 00:08.834
you will never
have to choose between
your life and your dream.

00:08.878 --> 00:12.186
Ever since Luthor Corp
partnered with us,
the board has a new member.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.665
He could lock in subscribers.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.580
It's built to trap you.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.756
You don't think
our users deserve a warning

00:17.800 --> 00:19.541
that the lenses
might be problematic?

00:19.584 --> 00:22.718
I need a full
diagnostic write-up
on the fail-safe error code.

00:22.761 --> 00:24.111
Yes, Miss Rojas.

00:24.154 --> 00:26.069
We'll always find you, Eve.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.592
Leviathan is everywhere.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.905
The shooter has been identified as Lex Luthor.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.472
Officers responding.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.691
He's been disarmed, but he's still on the premises.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.695
I knew it was him.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.266
That lady
on the ground
was gonna shoot us.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.311
One by one.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.140
And that's when
Mr. Luthor showed up.

00:54.271 --> 00:55.925
He wrestled the gun from her.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.188
It just went off.

01:01.887 --> 01:03.063
You saved them, Mr. Luthor.

01:06.109 --> 01:06.979
Thank you.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.504
Wait a minute.

01:09.547 --> 01:12.115
These people will all think
Lex saved them.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.335
Wasn't Lex the one
who put 'em in here?

01:14.378 --> 01:15.423
Apparently not.

01:16.728 --> 01:18.165
Listen to this.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.645
Amy Sapphire was right.

01:20.689 --> 01:25.128
Technology is the greatest evil mankind has ever faced.

01:25.172 --> 01:30.090
I will continue her work
by killing people
until the world wakes up

01:30.133 --> 01:31.656
from its apathy.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.445
She was an acolyte
of Amy Sapphire's.

01:37.488 --> 01:40.709
She'd been kidnapping
Obsidian Platinum users
for weeks.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.232
Took full responsibility.

01:42.276 --> 01:43.755
Thank you so much.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.455
I was sure Lex was behind this.

01:47.498 --> 01:49.021
Yeah. We all were.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.414
I don't understand.

01:54.114 --> 01:54.984
Lex...

01:55.637 --> 01:56.942
a real hero?

01:56.986 --> 01:58.205
How could this be true?

02:12.219 --> 02:16.701
It's so much more fun
making Superman
kill Superman.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.181
You've got to get
Luthor out of your head, Kal.

02:25.406 --> 02:26.581
Who are you?

02:27.886 --> 02:28.713
I...

02:31.107 --> 02:32.152
hate...

02:34.241 --> 02:35.720
Kryptonians.

02:41.552 --> 02:42.597
Are you all right, sir?

02:44.294 --> 02:45.426
That depends.

02:46.296 --> 02:47.210
Am I dead?

02:47.254 --> 02:49.734
Heavens no, sir.

02:49.778 --> 02:52.389
But I dare say
you're a bit hungover.

02:52.433 --> 02:53.303
Coffee?

03:03.139 --> 03:05.315
I saved the world.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.578
It's all in a day's work
for you, isn't it, Mr. Luthor?

03:08.666 --> 03:10.364
Why else would they
be awarding you

03:10.407 --> 03:11.974
the Nobel Peace Prize?

03:13.018 --> 03:15.586
Uh...

03:15.630 --> 03:16.935
I didn't just save the world...

03:18.763 --> 03:20.330
I made a new world.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.566
Any chance you've seen
my darling sister around?

03:42.526 --> 03:45.225
So, the Monitor
kept his word.

03:47.444 --> 03:50.621
The pre-Nobel celebration
went so late...

03:50.665 --> 03:53.189
Ms. Luthor decided
to spend the night.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.673
Don't worry, Lena, this will
just extend your beauty sleep
for a few hours

03:58.716 --> 04:00.283
while I handle
some family business.

04:00.805 --> 04:01.937
Sweet dreams.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.243
Make sure she ends up
in her own home.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.293
Sugar, dear?

04:10.337 --> 04:12.121
You're rather calm for a woman

04:12.164 --> 04:15.255
who just learned
the entire multi-verse
has been obliterated.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.779
You do understand
I'm not the son you raised?

04:17.822 --> 04:19.476
Perfectly.

04:19.519 --> 04:23.263
Would your Lillian
have been frightened
by world destruction?

04:23.306 --> 04:26.178
If so, you've upgraded.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.442
-No sugar.
-That's my boy.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.750
The past is the past.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.100
Best to focus on the future.

04:35.144 --> 04:39.409
In this world,
the Luthors are revered.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.977
How do we maintain our status?

04:42.020 --> 04:43.718
Well, of course,
the first order of business

04:43.761 --> 04:45.328
is finding
the Fortress of Solitude

04:45.372 --> 04:47.809
-and destroying
the Kryptonians--
-Why?

04:47.852 --> 04:49.550
Supergirl is
your greatest ally.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.856
Was, I'm afraid.

04:51.900 --> 04:55.425
Supergirl will remember
the previous world
as vividly as I do.

04:55.469 --> 04:56.948
Soon it will be war.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.428
We need to be prepared.

04:58.472 --> 04:59.473
You, me, and Lena.

04:59.516 --> 05:02.824
The Lena who killed you?
That Lena?

05:02.867 --> 05:05.870
Well, you said she'll remember
your previous world, too.

05:05.914 --> 05:06.784
What's your point?

05:07.959 --> 05:10.048
That you have
an inferiority complex

05:10.092 --> 05:12.616
over a pair of hokey heroes
in blue tights.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.183
If Supergirl sneezes too hard,

05:14.226 --> 05:15.750
it would split
this planet in half.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.970
And yet, it was her friendship
with your sister

05:19.014 --> 05:20.842
that spun you out.

05:20.885 --> 05:23.323
Friendship and loyalty
to Supergirl was what prompted
Lena to kill me.

05:23.366 --> 05:26.630
Your obsession with Kryptonians
led to your demise once.

05:28.023 --> 05:30.852
Let's not create
a repeat performance, hmm?

05:30.895 --> 05:33.637
On this planet,
the Luthors are cool-headed.

05:33.681 --> 05:37.162
We plan,
we implement, and we rise...

05:37.685 --> 05:39.339
together.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.950
Show your sister
you believe in her.

05:41.993 --> 05:44.518
Support her efforts.

05:44.561 --> 05:47.564
She'll gravitate toward you
and away from the Kryptonian.

05:48.217 --> 05:49.653
The question is...

05:49.697 --> 05:53.962
can you give up
your pet vendetta
and stay focused?

05:54.005 --> 05:57.226
Are you really querying
my strength of will, Mother?

05:58.836 --> 05:59.837
I'm a Luthor.

06:00.751 --> 06:01.622
Good.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.887
Now go make Lena your ally.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.499
All right,
so you'll be my friend now?

06:09.543 --> 06:11.588
The world is ours now, Lena.

06:12.763 --> 06:14.548
You don't need a robot.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.724
And you don't need friends.

06:16.767 --> 06:21.337
You need a partner.
Imagine what we could
accomplish together?

06:23.687 --> 06:24.906
Why not give it a go?

06:24.949 --> 06:26.777
You think
this is your world now?

06:29.998 --> 06:32.783
You were a puppet on a string
for Leviathan before.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.698
What makes this time
any different?

06:34.742 --> 06:36.091
What the hell is Leviathan?

06:39.181 --> 06:41.836
You see, that's the thing
about narcissists.

06:41.879 --> 06:45.448
You're so focused on yourself,
you can never see
that you're the mark.

06:45.492 --> 06:48.408
Your little fan-girl
was working for Leviathan
the entire time

06:48.451 --> 06:49.931
she was working you.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.368
Ms. Tessmacher.

06:52.412 --> 06:56.807
And what exactly
does Leviathan want?

06:56.851 --> 06:58.287
No one knows.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.637
They're behind
seismic catastrophes,

07:00.681 --> 07:02.465
earthquakes, floods, plagues.

07:02.509 --> 07:05.729
They're alien, ancient,
and all-powerful.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.818
And if it wasn't
for your hubris,

07:07.862 --> 07:09.951
you would've seen that
they were playing you.

07:12.388 --> 07:13.998
All right, Lena.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.436
You've had your fun letting me
know I let my eye off the ball.

07:18.046 --> 07:21.571
I'll admit this Leviathan
is... irritating.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.052
What are you gonna do?

07:24.095 --> 07:25.314
Exterminate them.

07:26.402 --> 07:28.752
Hello, National City!

07:28.796 --> 07:33.496
Well, by now you might've heard that my splashy show at ToyCon
caused, well...

07:33.540 --> 07:34.976
Hi, boys.

07:35.019 --> 07:37.239
Just stopping by
to examine the ship
for the DEO.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.764
That's your cue to leave
and wait outside.

07:42.549 --> 07:43.854
Search for Leviathan.

07:46.901 --> 07:47.858
Oh...

07:48.293 --> 07:49.338
Of course.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.688
Show me all of her associates.

07:54.038 --> 07:54.909
Stop.

07:57.564 --> 08:00.480
I underestimated you, Eve.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.917
Give me everything you have
on this woman on this Earth.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.056
Please...

08:22.850 --> 08:24.504
It is really loud out there.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.159
Lex Luthor?

08:29.073 --> 08:30.553
What are you doing here?

08:30.597 --> 08:32.207
I'm here to help you,
Ms. Tessmacher.

08:32.773 --> 08:33.861
You know my name?

08:34.818 --> 08:36.385
I know a lot more
than your name.

08:37.995 --> 08:40.998
I know that you're brilliant.

08:41.042 --> 08:45.525
I know that Leviathan
recruited you to work for them
as a spy and an assassin.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.527
But you turned them down,

08:47.570 --> 08:50.399
so they murdered your father
to change your mind.

08:50.442 --> 08:53.141
I know that they've forced you
to do their bidding

08:53.184 --> 08:57.580
by vowing to kill
your beloved mother
if you dare defy them.

08:57.624 --> 09:00.191
And I know
that you hate it,

09:01.541 --> 09:02.890
because you're a good person.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.109
Am I?

09:06.807 --> 09:08.765
You are, Eve, believe me.

09:10.724 --> 09:14.075
I wouldn't be rescuing
someone I didn't think was
worthy of my time.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.817
Nobody can fight Leviathan.

09:16.860 --> 09:19.036
You're going to
have to trust me.
Do you think you can do that?

09:23.127 --> 09:25.086
Better decide quick,
Ms. Tessmacher.

09:25.129 --> 09:29.133
Stay with them,
and continue to bloody
those pretty little hands...

09:29.177 --> 09:33.529
or work with me
to destroy the people
who stole your life.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.055
I don't want to kill anymore.

09:40.362 --> 09:41.363
Good choice.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.368
So, what do you want from me?

09:48.718 --> 09:50.111
Be my partner.

09:50.154 --> 09:53.244
Keep working at Leviathan,
and be my eyes and ears.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.986
In return,
I promise I'll protect you.

09:56.030 --> 10:01.949
And that you won't
have to do any of this
awful, dirty work anymore.

10:04.691 --> 10:05.735
I'll do it for you.

10:10.566 --> 10:14.004
Obsidian North is proud
to introduce Platinum,

10:14.048 --> 10:18.530
a virtual reality experience
that will look, feel, and taste

10:18.574 --> 10:20.924
more vivid than real life.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.623
Give yourself
the gift of Platinum.

10:30.586 --> 10:31.631
Ms. Tessmacher...

10:33.371 --> 10:35.417
what is it?

10:35.460 --> 10:38.681
I couldn't get Gamemnae
to take me
onto Leviathan's ship.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.684
-I'm scared.
-Ah. Forgive me, Eve.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.208
I should've eased your mind
days ago. Please.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.036
Now, this is a live feed.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.431
I'm sure you recognize
the sweet little house
you grew up in.

10:49.474 --> 10:52.434
There's your mother
baking in the kitchen.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.828
But I suspect
what you don't recognize

10:54.871 --> 10:57.700
is that sedan,
or those other two.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.790
Those cars belong
to ex-Mossad agents

11:00.834 --> 11:03.271
that I've hired to guard
your mother around the clock.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.841
How can I thank you,
Mr. Luthor?

11:07.884 --> 11:09.669
Lex, please.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.672
And you can thank me
after we've found
the cold-blooded killer

11:12.715 --> 11:13.847
who took your father's life.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.372
We're a team, Eve.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.376
I do have some good news.

11:21.419 --> 11:26.729
I convinced Gamemnae
I would be most useful
at Obsidian...

11:26.773 --> 11:28.644
on the Platinum project.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.690
Well done! You are brilliant.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.954
Well, we do have
one small problem.

11:33.997 --> 11:36.434
The Luthor tech that
your sister convinced
Andrea Rojas

11:36.478 --> 11:38.567
to put into
the Platinum infrastructure,

11:38.610 --> 11:40.177
it helped solve the bio-link

11:40.221 --> 11:42.266
when people were getting
toxic shock
eating virtual food.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.834
I like to refer to that
as the lobster problem.

11:44.878 --> 11:48.011
Or rather, middle America's
desire to be gluttons
without calories.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.752
Well, it caused a glitch.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.058
But...

11:51.841 --> 11:54.452
Your fail-safe failed.

11:54.496 --> 11:57.064
I assure you,
this glitch will be fixed

11:57.107 --> 11:59.153
long before the launch
of Obsidian Platinum.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.505
Don't worry, I found a way
to patch the glitch.

12:03.548 --> 12:04.811
That's not a glitch.

12:05.637 --> 12:06.856
That's my plan.

12:09.424 --> 12:14.211
My colleague is retrieving
a code that digitizes
the human psyche,

12:14.255 --> 12:16.518
enabling us to
make someone immortal

12:16.561 --> 12:19.782
by uploading
their consciousness
into a computer.

12:19.826 --> 12:24.178
I believe we can reverse
the same code
and use it against Leviathan.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.093
Then Leviathan is immortal
no more.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.965
But I need an invitation
to get onto their ship.

12:29.009 --> 12:32.882
Which means I need Gamemnae,
or Gemma, if you prefer,
to trust me.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.189
And trust begins
with that glitch.

12:35.232 --> 12:36.930
But if there's a glitch
and people are getting stuck,

12:36.973 --> 12:38.192
nobody's gonna buy the lenses.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.368
Correct. Leviathan will
need to fix it.

12:40.411 --> 12:43.414
But they won't be able to
because you won't let them.

12:43.458 --> 12:46.026
And when Leviathan
can't fix it,
they'll have to cover it up,

12:46.069 --> 12:47.854
and that's where I come in.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.682
I will help Gemma
with the cover-up.

12:50.726 --> 12:53.381
Once she trusts you,
she'll give you an invitation
to the ship.

12:53.424 --> 12:54.774
An engraved one.

12:54.817 --> 12:57.646
So, you need to go back
to Obsidian

12:57.689 --> 13:00.083
and make sure that glitch
does not get fixed,

13:00.127 --> 13:01.911
or traced back to me or Lena.

13:01.955 --> 13:02.825
Done.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.003
What are you gonna do?

13:08.483 --> 13:09.919
Start exerting pressure.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.448
Give me another one.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.800
Hell, you know what,
just give me the bottle.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.064
My wife is cheating on me.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.370
Tell me about it, man.

13:27.545 --> 13:28.503
Maybe I can help.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.728
Lex.

13:36.772 --> 13:39.296
My new apartment,
it's a dream!

13:39.340 --> 13:41.081
When you said that
you were getting me
a new place,

13:41.124 --> 13:42.909
I thought you meant
a small studio somewhere.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.998
You're very precious
to me, Eve.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.130
No one's ever treated me
this way before.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.654
It's time you realize
how wonderful you are.

13:49.698 --> 13:52.353
But we still have a mission.
How is Obsidian?

13:52.396 --> 13:54.659
I've been monitoring
all of the beta users.

13:54.703 --> 13:58.359
And Richard Bates
still hasn't made a move
on his wife's virtual lover.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.970
Not yet. Because his friend,
the bartender,

14:01.014 --> 14:03.494
who turned out to be
an amazing hacker,
I might add,

14:03.538 --> 14:07.237
won't let him complete
his virtual torture chamber
until the time is right.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.936
And I still need to
create trust with Leviathan.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.982
Amy Sapphire.

14:13.026 --> 14:15.898
She blames Obsidian's VR
for the death of her husband.

14:15.942 --> 14:19.075
She threatened
Andrea Rojas' life.

14:19.119 --> 14:23.514
-You're going to warn Gemma
to gain Leviathan's trust?
-The opposite.

14:23.558 --> 14:27.997
We're gonna help Amy Sapphire
attack Andrea Rojas
and blow up Obsidian.

14:28.041 --> 14:32.001
But if anyone attacks Obsidian,
Leviathan is gonna want me
to terminate them.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.090
Gemma won't ask you
to assassinate anybody

14:34.134 --> 14:36.527
because I will intervene
before she gets the chance.

14:36.571 --> 14:39.922
I will offer up Supergirl
to protect Andrea
and Obsidian.

14:39.966 --> 14:44.274
Just make sure
that Amy Sapphire
gets these gauntlets.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.537
It'll make her
a worthy adversary
for Supergirl.

14:46.581 --> 14:50.019
And after Supergirl succeeds
in saving Andrea,

14:50.063 --> 14:52.935
I will have proven myself
to Gemma.

14:52.979 --> 14:57.635
And then, I will suggest that
I roll out Obsidian Platinum
worldwide.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.638
Lex, you're brilliant.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.728
But beyond that,
you are so kind.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.165
-And I think I'm--
-I know, Eve.

15:06.253 --> 15:07.907
I feel the same.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.692
But we have to stay focused
on our goals,

15:10.735 --> 15:13.564
free you from them
and avenge your father.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.003
There'll be time for us later.

15:18.787 --> 15:19.831
Now, I have to
show you something.

15:23.879 --> 15:27.665
Oh, they're so cute!

15:30.233 --> 15:31.278
Aww!

15:32.975 --> 15:33.889
Q-waves?

15:34.542 --> 15:35.456
Something like that.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.202
Aw, he likes you.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.246
He's happy.

15:45.379 --> 15:46.336
That one isn't.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.905
Oh, gosh!
That didn't work right.

15:51.472 --> 15:54.040
Actually, it worked perfectly.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.005
Amy, no!

16:09.229 --> 16:10.317
This can't be right.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.501
Do you need to get that, dear?

16:21.937 --> 16:23.069
Not important.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.551
Ms. Tessmacher,
why have you brought me

16:27.595 --> 16:30.554
to the world's saddest
urgent care center?

16:30.598 --> 16:34.558
People have begun
getting stuck in the VR,
just like you anticipated.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.953
Uh, Gemma asked me
to look into the glitch.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.563
I told her that
there was nothing we could do

16:39.607 --> 16:41.043
without shutting down
the entire system,

16:41.087 --> 16:45.134
which can't be shut down
thanks to Luthor PowerCore.

16:45.178 --> 16:48.050
She asked Margot
to start cleaning things up.

16:48.094 --> 16:51.749
Who or what is a Margot?

16:51.793 --> 16:53.751
Leviathan middle-management...

16:53.795 --> 16:57.190
and a mean old hag to boot.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.627
It's time
to set Richard loose.

16:59.670 --> 17:04.066
This is a back door
that will allow Richard Bates
to hack into Platinum

17:04.109 --> 17:05.633
to get revenge.

17:05.675 --> 17:07.852
That'll put welcome eyes
on Obsidian's problems

17:07.896 --> 17:10.029
as this place starts
to fill up with bodies.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.377
Make sure he gets it.

17:11.421 --> 17:16.078
Oh, and I have
something else for you.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.040
Perfume?

17:21.083 --> 17:25.521
Uh-uh... Perfume, poison...
Potayto, potahto.

17:25.566 --> 17:28.047
What you're holding
is the deadliest substance
on Earth.

17:29.918 --> 17:33.139
You told me I wouldn't have to
kill for Leviathan ever again.

17:33.182 --> 17:35.097
And I always keep my promises.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.360
Every single one.

17:37.404 --> 17:40.624
That's why I tracked down
the man who murdered
your father...

17:40.668 --> 17:41.756
just like I said I would.

17:42.844 --> 17:43.801
Who is he?

17:44.628 --> 17:46.848
A Leviathan enforcer.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.807
He's in the Peruvian Andes
working undercover with an NGO.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.419
I suspect
because he has a target there.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.290
I should put a bullet
in his head.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.075
It's the least he deserves.

17:56.118 --> 17:59.861
But we can't go to war
with Leviathan.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.515
It has to look like
an accident.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.951
You can handle that, right?

18:02.994 --> 18:03.952
Yes.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.649
Then be quick.

18:05.693 --> 18:08.261
I don't expect that
he will stay in one place
for very long.

18:08.304 --> 18:09.827
And nor will I.

18:09.871 --> 18:11.916
It's time for me to embark
on my world tour,

18:11.960 --> 18:14.136
hawking Obsidian lenses.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.573
The beginning of the end...

18:16.617 --> 18:17.748
of Leviathan.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.580
"Our lives are connected

18:23.624 --> 18:25.756
by 1,000 invisible threads."

18:27.018 --> 18:29.543
Those immortal words
by Herman Melville

18:29.586 --> 18:32.807
are realized today
with Obsidian technology.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.245
This is my house!

18:36.289 --> 18:38.465
-And this is my gun.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.424
But with
Obsidian Platinum,

18:41.468 --> 18:42.904
you hold the thread.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.255
You are the architect
of your world!

18:46.299 --> 18:48.649
-They found Dad.
-Jeremiah?

18:48.692 --> 18:50.303
He's dead.

18:50.346 --> 18:51.695
And not only your world,

18:51.739 --> 18:53.436
but the world.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.264
There is nothing you cannot

18:55.308 --> 18:57.005
manipulate to your own ends.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.442
Nothing you cannot control!

18:59.486 --> 19:01.966
So are you blowing off steam
playing hero,

19:02.010 --> 19:04.447
or working something out?

19:04.491 --> 19:06.145
♪ I never lost control

19:07.276 --> 19:11.193
♪ You're face to face

19:11.237 --> 19:13.195

19:13.239 --> 19:14.892
Obsidian offers
something special,

19:14.936 --> 19:17.243
something unique,
something rare,

19:17.286 --> 19:18.766
and that, my friends,

19:18.809 --> 19:21.116
is control!

19:21.160 --> 19:25.076
-Complete and total control!

19:31.082 --> 19:35.174
One hundred countries,
worldwide saturation.

19:35.217 --> 19:39.221
It took 40 years
for the cell phone to
reach as many users

19:39.265 --> 19:42.485
as our lenses have reached
in one month.

19:42.529 --> 19:46.924
All thanks
to our passionate ambassador,
Lex Luthor.

19:46.968 --> 19:50.885

Kara...

20:15.344 --> 20:16.650
I heard about Jeremiah.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.349
I came to offer up sympathies.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.572
"Offer up
my sympathies."

20:25.615 --> 20:27.356
-God, I sound like an android.
-No.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.053
No, you said it like someone

20:29.097 --> 20:30.794
who's afraid
to confront the woman
who called you a villain.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.408
My mother died
when I was very young.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.149
And I'm...

20:38.193 --> 20:41.849
I know that pales
in comparison to the losses
that you've suffered,

20:41.892 --> 20:43.590
but I know
it doesn't get any easier.

20:45.592 --> 20:46.462
I'm sorry.

20:50.466 --> 20:53.252
Thank you for saying that.
That means a lot
coming from you.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.345
Um...

20:59.388 --> 21:03.566
This helped me a lot
with memories of my mother

21:03.610 --> 21:05.742
and other family difficulties.

21:05.786 --> 21:08.658
Well, if it helped with
Luthor family difficulties,

21:08.702 --> 21:10.225
I'm sure it'll help me a lot.

21:14.708 --> 21:15.535
Thank you.

21:35.598 --> 21:39.428
You missed a perfectly fine en passant
capture opportunity.

21:39.472 --> 21:42.126
You're distracted.
What's wrong?

21:42.170 --> 21:44.825
She apologized to her.

21:44.868 --> 21:46.696
Be clear
with your pronouns, dear.

21:46.740 --> 21:51.092
Lena apologized to Kara.
To Supergirl.

21:51.135 --> 21:52.528
For the death of Jeremiah.

21:52.572 --> 21:54.617
-I thought
you put that behind you.
-I did!

21:54.661 --> 21:57.664
The assassination
of Jeremiah Danvers was
the perfect chess move,

21:57.707 --> 22:00.667
but for the fact that
it maddeningly drove Lena
back to Supergirl!

22:00.710 --> 22:03.583
And the worst part is
that I didn't even see it
as a possibility.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.367
So, yes, Mother,
I missed the en passant.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.195
I'm missing a lot of things,
I'm slipping.

22:07.238 --> 22:10.416
The only thing
you're slipping off of
is the wagon.

22:10.459 --> 22:13.375
So Lena showed the alien
a little humanity?

22:13.419 --> 22:15.246
-What's wrong with that?
-It pushes the limit.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.161
First, it's an apology.

22:17.205 --> 22:19.207
Then, it's coffee before work.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.730
Next thing you know,
they're playing Pictionary.
That cannot happen!

22:22.210 --> 22:24.343
I know what to do.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.823
I'll set up Supergirl.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.782
You already
have a plan in place
with Leviathan.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.523
I did, but this is better.

22:30.566 --> 22:33.917
Why use a nuke
to create a catastrophe
to draw Leviathan out,

22:33.961 --> 22:38.269
when I can use a Sun-Eater
to turn Lena against
Kara Danvers in one stroke?

22:38.313 --> 22:41.664
I asked you if you had
the strength of will,

22:41.708 --> 22:43.971
and you said, "Yes, Mother!"

22:44.885 --> 22:47.017
This is a display of weakness.

22:47.061 --> 22:49.585
Not weakness, Mother.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.372
Inspiration.

22:54.851 --> 22:55.809
Checkmate.

22:58.812 --> 23:01.641
Ms. Tessmacher,
it's time to activate
William Dey.

23:01.684 --> 23:03.425
Make sure your contact
gives him the name

23:03.469 --> 23:05.253
on the medical bracelet
he found.

23:05.296 --> 23:07.908
And then,
I need you to move the bodies.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.737
Don't you think
that it's weird

23:10.780 --> 23:13.653
that we're sitting here
eating dumplings
like everything is normal,

23:13.696 --> 23:16.395
and yet, Jeremiah is gone?

23:16.438 --> 23:20.094
No. The only permanent thing
about life is
that things change.

23:20.137 --> 23:21.835
The cycle of life goes on.

23:21.878 --> 23:24.359
And you... still need to eat.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.405
Yeah, you know what,
this book the Lena gave me

23:26.448 --> 23:28.885
actually has
strikingly similar advice.

23:28.929 --> 23:31.235
"Things are constantly in flux,

23:31.279 --> 23:33.716
arising and passing
with each moment."

23:33.760 --> 23:38.329
-We have no control,
so eat the dumplings.
-Yeah.

23:38.373 --> 23:41.376
Well, I still can't believe
the fact that she gave you that
after everything that happened.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.683
Well, maybe she's
coming around.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.162
-Seeing the light about Lex.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.469
No. No light about him.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.993
-That man is--
-The devil incarnate.

23:50.037 --> 23:51.386
-Yes.
-Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

23:52.996 --> 23:54.737
I hope you weren't
talking about me.

23:54.781 --> 23:59.089
No. No, no, no.
Lex Luthor.

23:59.133 --> 24:01.135
-And are these baked goods?
-Yes.

24:01.178 --> 24:03.790
Scones, sticky toffee pudding,
and banoffee pie,

24:03.833 --> 24:06.053
all my mother's
favorite recipes
for comfort food.

24:06.096 --> 24:08.359
-I... I hope it helps.

24:08.403 --> 24:09.839
Oh, my God!

24:09.883 --> 24:11.885
You made all of this?

24:11.928 --> 24:15.018
Well, I didn't want to
show up empty-handed
coming here, asking for help...

24:15.062 --> 24:17.760
with a story on Lex Luthor
and Obsidian.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.283
You got a lead?

24:19.327 --> 24:21.416
Wait, you, you both
have been working on this?

24:21.460 --> 24:24.637
Before your father's funeral,
Kelly and I were onto this idea

24:24.680 --> 24:26.508
that Lex had done something
to Obsidian

24:26.552 --> 24:29.293
to cause people
to get stuck in VR
and disappear.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.991
The missing people were
wearing Obsidian lenses.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.471
And a friend of mine
from the NSA

24:32.514 --> 24:35.212
found a cluster of users
all at the same address,

24:35.256 --> 24:36.562
a warehouse.

24:36.605 --> 24:39.086
But when I checked,
it was empty.

24:39.129 --> 24:41.828
Only weird thing was
a hospital ID bracelet
on the ground.

24:41.871 --> 24:43.307
So, I checked it
for fingerprints.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.353
I found one and sent it
to my buddy at the NSA.

24:45.396 --> 24:48.008
Now, he just called me back
with results when I was baking.

24:48.051 --> 24:51.446
The bracelet belonged
to a Richard Bates.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.448
The same person
who hacked
Obsidian's fail-safe.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.928
And who I beat up in VR.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.843
One and the same.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.671
And get this...

24:58.714 --> 25:02.544
The hospital has no record
of a Richard Bates
ever being admitted.

25:02.588 --> 25:06.548
Wait a minute. Kelly, you said
there was a list of users that
are still stuck in VR, right?

25:06.592 --> 25:08.768
-Can you show me that?
-Yeah.

25:08.811 --> 25:11.988
Here. This is
the current list of users.

25:13.686 --> 25:17.037
Bonnie.
I met this girl in VR.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.082
Why would anyone want
to keep her there?

25:19.126 --> 25:20.780
Human testing.
Organ harvesting.

25:20.823 --> 25:22.825
And if people
are getting hurt in Obsidian,

25:22.869 --> 25:26.089
we need to find out about it
and expose them.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.439
If we find the proof,
I'll run the story.

25:28.483 --> 25:30.354
It'll be around the globe
in minutes.

25:30.398 --> 25:33.270
The world will know
if Obsidian is
endangering them.

25:33.314 --> 25:34.445
They're on your tail.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.013
It doesn't matter.

25:37.057 --> 25:40.364
Our cloaking technology
will cover all our bases
from the human eye.

25:40.408 --> 25:42.541
They won't stop
until they uncover the truth.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.587
And what is that exactly?

25:45.631 --> 25:48.982
That you and your
Leviathan associates

25:49.635 --> 25:51.506
are ancient beings

25:51.550 --> 25:53.377
who manage humanity's

25:54.640 --> 25:56.337
excesses.

25:56.380 --> 25:59.993
Don't get me wrong,
 Gemma,
or Gamemnae,

26:00.036 --> 26:02.517
or would you prefer, uh,
Goddess of Technology?

26:02.996 --> 26:04.388
I approve.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.782
Pompei was spectacular,

26:06.826 --> 26:09.176
the Black Plague, intriguing,

26:09.219 --> 26:14.268
and your current move,
creating an addiction
to Obsidian Platinum, genius.

26:14.311 --> 26:19.490
-The only problem is
your plan is now at risk.
-No, it's not.

26:19.534 --> 26:23.190
I'll pull up the timeline
for our VR global event.

26:23.233 --> 26:27.020
It'll be a happening beyond
humanity's wildest dreams.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.718
A virtual gathering of
everyone around the world.

26:29.762 --> 26:32.242
No one will want to miss it.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.984
And once the masses are in VR,

26:35.028 --> 26:36.986
I'll kill them all
with a flick of my wrist.

26:37.030 --> 26:40.294
That would be great,
if you weren't
about to be exposed.

26:40.337 --> 26:42.905
Obsidian will be shut down,
all the lenses returned

26:42.949 --> 26:44.646
before you sell
the first ticket.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.430
You don't have
the luxury of time.

26:46.474 --> 26:47.867
What do you propose?

26:48.563 --> 26:50.304
Create fear.

26:50.347 --> 26:53.481
It's instantaneous,
and I have a specific idea
of how to do it.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.962
I just need
your stealthiest operative.

26:59.748 --> 27:02.490
Director Dox,
long time no see.

27:02.533 --> 27:05.798
I come bearing gifts,
a pysanka.

27:05.841 --> 27:09.236
Gifted to me
by a Ukrainian holy man
on my world tour.

27:09.279 --> 27:12.500
It brings love and wealth,
and of course fertility.

27:12.543 --> 27:14.807
Does it also bring
the end of Leviathan?

27:18.201 --> 27:20.813
You were meant to have gotten
the location of their ship...

27:20.856 --> 27:23.598
so we can implant
the mortality code.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.296
I can't push them.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.211
This delay doesn't have
anything to do

27:28.255 --> 27:31.301
with you using
Obsidian Platinum for
your own ends, does it?

27:32.955 --> 27:34.565
Alex Danvers called me.

27:34.609 --> 27:37.177
She wants me to help her
track Obsidian users

27:37.220 --> 27:39.570
she believes are being
lured into some type of coma.

27:40.180 --> 27:41.964
By you.

27:42.008 --> 27:46.360
While it is utterly predictable
that Alex Danvers
would call you,

27:46.403 --> 27:49.406
it's not me behind
your missing users,
it's Leviathan.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.018
Scout's honor.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.584
I found out from Gemma Cooper.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.630
Then help me find them.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.937
You have the Q-wave cube
from Winn's ship.

27:57.980 --> 28:01.375
I can use it
to track the lenses,
find the missing people.

28:01.418 --> 28:04.334
Ah, well, I gave the cube
to Lena.

28:04.378 --> 28:07.642
And if you involved her,
Leviathan would kill her.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.253
And as much as
I'd like to help you,
I can't.

28:10.297 --> 28:13.300
Leviathan would find out,
and then I'd be their enemy.

28:13.343 --> 28:16.477
And as you know,
the long-term success
of our plan

28:16.520 --> 28:18.740
relies on me
being the opposite.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.829
But, by all means,
you should help them.

28:20.873 --> 28:23.049
I know how important
your friends are to you.

28:25.094 --> 28:26.052
Okay.

28:26.095 --> 28:28.924
Lex, how shall I help them?

28:28.968 --> 28:32.145
There's nothing at the DEO
that could track Q-waves.

28:34.843 --> 28:37.193
Why don't you ask Supergirl?

28:37.237 --> 28:40.631
I'm sure there's something
at that fortress of hers
that could help.

28:45.898 --> 28:47.421
Hey, any luck
with the warehouse?

28:47.464 --> 28:48.901
It was empty.

28:48.944 --> 28:51.338
I was able to pick up
Richard Bates' psychic signal,

28:51.381 --> 28:54.036
along with dozens of
other people in that warehouse.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.778
But when I tried to connect,
there was
some kind of interference.

28:58.519 --> 29:01.783
It's because Obsidian is
adding Platinum users
by the minute.

29:01.827 --> 29:05.439
The lenses interface
with the brain
by using Q-waves...

29:05.482 --> 29:07.006
which operate
on a similar frequency

29:07.049 --> 29:08.877
as Malefic's Martian brain.

29:08.921 --> 29:11.750
Just as I can't connect
with Mal, I can't find
those missing people.

29:13.882 --> 29:15.492
You can connect with them...

29:16.755 --> 29:17.843
by using Myriad.

29:20.846 --> 29:23.936
Lena wanted
to use Myriad to disperse
her Q-wave mind control,

29:23.979 --> 29:25.459
but if you turn it on
in reverse,

29:25.502 --> 29:28.767
it will compress the Q-waves
in the atmosphere...

29:28.810 --> 29:31.465
making it possible
for you to track
the psychic signatures.

29:34.381 --> 29:35.904
And it wouldn't be dangerous?

29:35.948 --> 29:37.558
In your hands, no.

29:39.647 --> 29:40.474
Then I'll go.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.345
But I don't like it.

29:44.565 --> 29:48.569
The brain anatomy
of Patient 054 remains normal
post-Non Nocere.

29:48.612 --> 29:52.660
The trial continues to exhibit
positive results
of Q-wave adoption.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.793
Brava!

29:54.836 --> 29:57.578
You've always been
so meticulous about
your data collection.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.842
-What is that?

30:02.801 --> 30:07.457
I use a Q-wave broadcast
to remotely access
patients' brain activity.

30:07.501 --> 30:09.851
It's being interrupted
by an overlapping signal.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.027
How could someone
suppress Q-waves?

30:14.900 --> 30:18.381
I recognize the signature
of this interruption,
it's Myriad.

30:18.425 --> 30:21.602
Yesterday, I thought
I had an honest conversation
with Supergirl,

30:21.645 --> 30:26.563
and today I find out
that she's using Myriad
to interrupt my experiments?

30:26.607 --> 30:29.697
The very device she told me
was too dangerous
for anyone to use.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.568
You saw Supergirl yesterday?

30:33.832 --> 30:37.313
I could always just
go to the Fortress,
if you told me where it was,

30:37.357 --> 30:39.925
and turn off Myriad
before she interferes again.

30:39.968 --> 30:41.665
No, you'll set off
the El Protocol.

30:41.709 --> 30:42.971
This is a new world.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.234
One where Luthors
and Kryptonians work together.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.933
The fortress security won't be
programmed to attack us.

30:47.976 --> 30:50.587
If she's using Myriad,
I wanna see it for myself.

30:50.631 --> 30:53.460
Besides, you at the fortress
sounds apocalyptic.

30:54.678 --> 30:55.505
Well...

30:56.332 --> 30:58.944
then let this ride be on me.

31:18.311 --> 31:19.965
You are using Myriad.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.314
Lena, what are you doing here?

31:21.357 --> 31:24.099
Question is, what are you
doing here, Supergirl?

31:24.143 --> 31:25.666
I thought it was forbidden
to use Myriad,

31:25.709 --> 31:27.494
but forbidden
for anyone but you.

31:27.537 --> 31:30.758
There are people missing,
dozens of them stuck
in Obsidian's VR.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.151
I have to find them.

31:32.194 --> 31:33.848
There are other ways
to find people than Myriad.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.589
I can think of four
off the top of my head,

31:35.632 --> 31:37.199
but you,
you do what you want.

31:37.243 --> 31:40.072
What I'm doing
is finding people
your brother disappeared.

31:40.115 --> 31:41.900
Do you have any proof
that it was Lex?

31:42.683 --> 31:44.772
No, I didn't think so.

31:44.815 --> 31:48.254
You just return
to your default position
of blaming a Luthor.

31:48.297 --> 31:50.299
You did tell me you'd
treat me like a villain...

31:50.343 --> 31:53.737
If you acted like one,
yeah, I did say that.

31:53.781 --> 31:56.044
And right now,
you're trespassing,
and I don't have time for this.

31:56.088 --> 31:57.176
You need to go.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.917
I'll leave
when you stop using Myriad.

32:01.136 --> 32:02.181
That's not gonna happen.

32:03.617 --> 32:05.749
To think that I was
sincere with you yesterday...

32:08.013 --> 32:09.928
Then I guess
you're used to being two-faced.

32:23.942 --> 32:24.768
No!

32:31.036 --> 32:33.386
Why is this taking so long?

32:33.429 --> 32:36.084
It takes several minutes
for Myriad to suppress
the Q-waves long enough

32:36.128 --> 32:37.259
for J'onn to see clearly.

32:41.524 --> 32:42.482
What is that?

32:43.657 --> 32:45.093
A Sun-Eater.

32:45.789 --> 32:47.182
That's impossible.

32:47.226 --> 32:48.444
The only one in the system...

32:49.706 --> 32:51.926
is the baby
from the Fortress of Solitude.

32:52.492 --> 32:53.536
Supergirl?

32:54.363 --> 32:56.496
Supergirl, are you there?

32:56.539 --> 32:58.367
The Sun-Eater must've absorbed
her power.

32:58.411 --> 33:00.674
Okay, well, we need to
save her. Like now.

33:00.717 --> 33:03.198
We can use a Lexosuit
from the DEO.

33:03.242 --> 33:06.897
If we recalibrate
the suit's internal radiation
to 1,000 watts per meter,

33:06.941 --> 33:08.987
it will act like
a mini-sunlight chamber.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.771
We'll get it
and bring it to the fortress.

33:13.252 --> 33:15.645
-M'gann?
-J'onn...

33:15.689 --> 33:18.387
your brother felt the Q-waves
on Mars and sent me.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.172
My ship is armed
with hydrogen weapons

33:20.215 --> 33:21.608
we can use
to stop the Sun-Eater.

33:22.522 --> 33:25.133
Han Solo never looked so good.

33:25.177 --> 33:27.875
-That was
a Star Warsreference.
-I know it. I know. Yeah.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.445
Let's go save the sun.

33:57.296 --> 33:59.124
Oh, heaven to Betsy.

34:17.446 --> 34:20.623
The hydrogen explosive
should reduce it to a size
that we can contain.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.844
If I can detonate one
inside it

34:23.887 --> 34:25.933
and saturate it
like water with a fire.

34:25.976 --> 34:27.935
I have faith in you,
J'onn J'onzz.

34:36.944 --> 34:37.813
J'onn?

34:49.652 --> 34:51.393
Anyone see a Sun-Eater
around here?

34:52.177 --> 34:53.091
Supergirl!

34:57.138 --> 35:01.186
We think we can shrink it
by detonating this explosive
in its core.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.318
Lucky this suit has
its own explosives.

35:07.235 --> 35:08.106
Missiles hot!

35:32.652 --> 35:33.783
Right on schedule.

35:40.660 --> 35:42.401
Ms. Tessmacher!

35:46.100 --> 35:48.450
That thing is
much cuter when it's smaller.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.539
Yeah, and not destroying
the solar system.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.368
Have you figured out
what the Morae wanted
or who she works for?

35:55.718 --> 35:58.068
She says she works
for someone called Leviathan.

36:00.332 --> 36:03.248
-J'onn, what is it?

36:03.291 --> 36:05.772
Myriad... the psychic trail.

36:07.208 --> 36:08.862
I know where
those missing people are.

36:14.302 --> 36:18.567
Lex, a real hero?
How can this be true?

36:18.611 --> 36:21.091
If you weren't so obsessed
with trying to persecute me,

36:21.135 --> 36:22.615
you might see that
on this Earth,

36:22.658 --> 36:24.573
I've always been the hero.

36:24.617 --> 36:26.445
All these people say so.

36:26.488 --> 36:29.012
But I guess
we're all heroes today,

36:29.056 --> 36:33.147
since I'm assuming
you and your friends
dealt with the big blackout.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.844
You're not gonna
try and pin that on me,
are you?

36:34.888 --> 36:38.805
No, that was... Leviathan.

36:38.848 --> 36:42.765
The same Leviathan that
I told you would be a problem
months ago?

36:42.809 --> 36:46.813
Perhaps if you listened to me
and tried to work with me,

36:46.856 --> 36:49.207
we could stop
these dangerous organizations

36:49.250 --> 36:51.818
before they try
to blot out the sun.

36:51.861 --> 36:54.734
So, do you know what they want,

36:54.777 --> 36:56.083
or where their base is?

36:56.126 --> 36:57.563
Not yet.

36:57.606 --> 36:59.869
-But we will.
-We're going to stop them.

37:03.612 --> 37:05.440
You murdered Margot!

37:05.484 --> 37:08.400
One of my own,
one of Leviathan's
most trusted agents.

37:08.443 --> 37:10.445
Margot's death was unfortunate.

37:10.489 --> 37:13.361
But she had to die,
given the breadth of our--

37:14.710 --> 37:16.712
You don't tell me anything.

37:16.756 --> 37:18.105
I am a god.

37:18.148 --> 37:19.411
You are a nothing.

37:19.454 --> 37:20.586
Do you understand?

37:25.634 --> 37:26.940
Explain yourself.

37:33.860 --> 37:36.079
As I said earlier...

37:36.123 --> 37:39.213
the Supers were close
to finding your comatose souls.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.346
So, I had to find them first.

37:41.389 --> 37:44.740
I moved them,
and then pinned their existence
on someone else.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.960
So, I connected Margot
to Amy Sapphire

37:47.003 --> 37:49.310
and divorced her
from you and Leviathan.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.920
Because of what I did,

37:50.964 --> 37:54.707
no one is suspecting
Obsidian anymore.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.535
Maybe you were right
to kill Margot,

37:58.058 --> 38:00.539
but you made a mistake
with the disaster.

38:00.582 --> 38:03.759
And now the Kryptonian
has one of my assassins
in her custody!

38:03.803 --> 38:06.371
I underestimated Supergirl
and her team.

38:06.414 --> 38:09.765
The chaos of the disaster
was working
until she intervened.

38:09.809 --> 38:11.854
But now I know

38:11.898 --> 38:14.770
you were right about
the global VR celebration.

38:14.814 --> 38:17.033
We should
implement it immediately.

38:17.077 --> 38:19.949
Gather everyone into VR
at once...

38:19.993 --> 38:21.864
with this
sparkling distraction.

38:23.039 --> 38:24.127
But first...

38:25.128 --> 38:26.739
we must kill Supergirl.

38:26.782 --> 38:29.176
She will always foil the plan.

38:30.177 --> 38:31.613
And a warning...

38:31.657 --> 38:33.833
no mere mortal can kill her.

38:33.876 --> 38:35.704
Many have tried and failed.

38:42.972 --> 38:44.278
I will not fail.

38:53.809 --> 38:56.682
Do I smell Beef Wellington?

38:56.725 --> 39:00.294
Victory and role-playing
makes me hungry.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.035
"Amy Sapphire was right.

39:02.078 --> 39:05.386
Technology is the greatest evil
mankind has ever faced."

39:05.430 --> 39:06.822
Okay, stop there.

39:06.866 --> 39:09.869
Please don't ever image-induce
into her ever again.

39:09.912 --> 39:13.089
-I might lose my appetite.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.353
I'm so glad
we finally have a night

39:15.396 --> 39:17.006
to spend some time alone
as a couple.

39:17.833 --> 39:18.660
A couple?

39:20.053 --> 39:22.577
I've been trying to tell you
how I feel...

39:22.621 --> 39:26.189
and it's not just
because you helped me
escape Leviathan,

39:26.233 --> 39:27.887
it's because of who you are.

39:29.845 --> 39:31.281
How could I not love you?

39:32.805 --> 39:33.806
Oh...

39:35.111 --> 39:36.765
Ms. Tessmacher...

39:38.114 --> 39:41.422
you sad, silly woman...

39:41.466 --> 39:43.293
of course you love me.

39:43.337 --> 39:46.296
What's funny is, you thought
I could love you back.

39:48.821 --> 39:50.692
I don't understand.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.129
We're a team.

39:53.173 --> 39:56.655
-We're meant to be together.
We're destined--
-Oh, we're destined.

39:56.698 --> 39:59.527
On another world,
in another life, we knew
each other very well.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.790
And in that life,
you said you loved me, too.

40:01.834 --> 40:04.227
You distracted me,
you made me weaker.

40:04.271 --> 40:06.360
But that's not happening
this time, honey.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.275
I feel nothing for you.

40:08.318 --> 40:10.408
I saved you
because you were useful.

40:10.451 --> 40:12.453
I needed a spy
inside Leviathan.

40:12.497 --> 40:14.760
Oh, and as for your mother...

40:14.803 --> 40:17.893
she's still in danger,
but from me.

40:17.937 --> 40:20.374
Those cars I showed you,
the men in them

40:20.418 --> 40:23.290
are just waiting
to pull the trigger
if you ever betray me.

40:23.333 --> 40:25.858
But I'd think twice
about that.

40:25.901 --> 40:27.947
That man you killed
in the Andes

40:27.990 --> 40:30.079
didn't murder your father.

40:30.123 --> 40:32.473
I never bothered to find out
who knocked off
your old man.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.344
No, the man you murdered

40:34.388 --> 40:35.998
is Supergirl's father.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.483
Oh, that's good.

40:42.527 --> 40:45.443
I have video of you
killing him, by the way.

40:45.486 --> 40:47.357
Defy me, and I'll pass it on.

40:47.401 --> 40:50.491
Believe me, you do not
want to be on the wrong side
of those laser eyes.

40:51.884 --> 40:54.016
You are worse than Leviathan.

40:54.843 --> 40:55.975
Not worse.

40:57.455 --> 40:58.412
Better.

40:59.674 --> 41:01.763
- Mother.

41:01.807 --> 41:05.114
Hate to say I told you so,
but it all went
according to plan.

41:05.158 --> 41:08.466
Lena's back on my side,
Leviathan is set to
kill our enemies,

41:08.509 --> 41:10.337
and I'm set
to wipe out Leviathan.

41:10.380 --> 41:11.207
And...

41:12.252 --> 41:13.471
I did it my way.

41:32.751 --> 41:33.665
Ah, screw it.
