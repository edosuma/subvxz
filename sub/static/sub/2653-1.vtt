WEBVTT

00:03.570 --> 00:05.551
What's all this? I said one suitcase.

00:05.606 --> 00:08.780
- I need choices, Jay.
- Colombia's not one of your more formal nations.

00:08.843 --> 00:11.050
The guy on their money's
sitting in a lawn chair.

00:11.112 --> 00:14.787
Ay. I cannot believe
that my little baby's leaving me.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.851
You know, I left the glass doors
open downstairs...

00:16.917 --> 00:19.693
so right now your actual baby
may be leaving.

00:20.755 --> 00:23.668
Ah, ah, ah! One robe.

00:23.724 --> 00:27.729
I guess we know what everyone
will be talking about my second morning there.

00:27.795 --> 00:31.971
Manny's visiting Gloria's family
for about a month- I hope.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.535
I just got to get him on a plane...

00:33.601 --> 00:36.081
before Gloria has a meltdown
and changes her mind.

00:36.137 --> 00:40.381
'Cause if he doesn't go to Colombia,
Colombia comes to me.

00:41.909 --> 00:43.411
It's happened before.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.582
Gloria!

00:54.755 --> 00:56.962
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
- What?

00:57.024 --> 00:58.526
Oh, it's Mitchell. We won.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.333
Oh, that's great! What we won?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.101
It's fantastic. We've waited so long.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.906
- What did we won?
- The Supreme Court ruling. Gay marriage is legal.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.503
- ¡Ay.! Congratulations.
- Thanks, Gloria.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.071
Can I talk to Cam?

01:10.137 --> 01:11.810
Uh, yes. Hold on.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.443
- It's-
- Thank you. Yeah. it's Mitchell. Hi. Hey.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.818
I gotta go, but can you believe
this finally happened?

01:16.877 --> 01:19.118
I know. it's amazing.
We'll celebrate tonight. I love you.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.751
- Celebrate what?
- Oh. Well, Jay, hold on to your hat...

01:21.816 --> 01:23.818
but as of today in California...

01:23.884 --> 01:25.488
it's legal for a man to marry another man!

01:27.121 --> 01:28.623
Ew. He threw up.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.067
He just needs some time
to get used to the idea, honey.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.627
It's so great, Cam.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.195
Yeah, I'm happy for you guys.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.140
Gloria, Manny needs his birth certificate
to reenter the country.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.007
- Any idea where it is?
- I don't know.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.376
Oh, that's right.
He leaves today. You must be a wreck.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.211
She's not a wreck. She's a rock.
I looked and it's not in the safe.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.807
This one had her first sleepover
last week.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.784
I just had to tough my way through it.

01:47.842 --> 01:49.719
He picked me up in the dark.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.916
I can't find that birth certificate
anywhere, Jay.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.481
Maybe it's a sign and-

01:53.547 --> 01:55.083
it's a sign we need a refresher meeting...

01:55.149 --> 01:56.651
on what goes in the safe.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.219
Here's a preview- no shoes.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.788
I looked online, and we can get a copy
if we go to the courthouse.

02:00.855 --> 02:03.461
That's what we're gonna do.
In the car. We'll be back in an hour.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.266
Hey, Cam.
Congratulations. Go, gay marriage!

02:07.995 --> 02:09.497
He did it again.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.543
Ay. Sí.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.101
Okay. Well-

02:13.934 --> 02:15.777
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:15.836 --> 02:17.975
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:18.038 --> 02:19.949
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:20.007 --> 02:21.987
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:22.042 --> 02:23.112
♪ Hey,♪♪

02:25.446 --> 02:29.258
So tell me, Cam. How does it work
when it is between two men?

02:29.316 --> 02:31.819
Well, I don't really feel comfortable
talking about that in front of Lily.

02:31.886 --> 02:33.388
I know how that works.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.525
I rented the wrong movie once.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.934
Did you see Glen, Garry, Glenn and Ross?

02:38.993 --> 02:40.802
Uh, no. Why don't you go play?

02:40.861 --> 02:43.137
What I mean is, who proposes to who?

02:43.197 --> 02:45.973
I don't know. We've talked about it-
if it ever became legal.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.912
Okay, and now it is.
So are you going to do it today?

02:48.969 --> 02:51.210
- It just happened. I haven't really had-
- You have to do it today.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.310
Every couple deserves
a beautiful proposal story.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.083
Well, I have always adored
my mom and dad's story.

02:57.144 --> 03:00.591
He plowed "Will you marry me?" into
a snowy field right outside of her window.

03:00.648 --> 03:03.094
And then he tried to recreate it
for their 25th wedding anniversary...

03:03.150 --> 03:05.494
but there was no snow,
so he burned it into a cornfield.

03:05.553 --> 03:06.861
Bad idea.

03:06.921 --> 03:10.425
But Mama did get a second ring
out of it with the FEMA money.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.335
Ay. I wish I also had a romantic story.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.898
One day, we were watching TV
before dinner, and Jay says...

03:16.964 --> 03:18.944
"Manny, hand me that thing."

03:18.999 --> 03:20.535
And Manny gives him the ring.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.810
I was very happy, of course,
but it's not the best story.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.284
At least Javier was on top of a dolphin.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.514
Soldiers talk about that moment...

03:29.577 --> 03:31.955
When they shut off,
when the war finally wins.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.514
Get down!

03:33.581 --> 03:35.356
- Shut up!
- I can't see the TV!

03:35.416 --> 03:36.918
Turn the fan on!

03:36.984 --> 03:38.861
Stop yelling! My head's going to explode!

03:38.919 --> 03:42.958
For me, that moment
is four days into summer vacation.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.468
Hey, honey. What's up?

03:44.525 --> 03:47.267
Do you remember
when summer meant fireflies...

03:47.328 --> 03:48.864
And cutoff shorts and ice cream trucks?

03:48.929 --> 03:50.431
Well, one out of three.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.170
We'll get our time.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.735
They're all going away
at some point, right?

03:53.801 --> 03:55.803
Yeah. Haley's got her beach trip...

03:55.869 --> 03:59.373
and Alex is doing Habitat for Humanity
and Luke has camp.

03:59.440 --> 04:04.014
If I remember, I think we have six hours
totally kid-free on- Oh, the 14th.

04:04.078 --> 04:07.116
If we moved Alex's flight,
we could have, like, 10 or 12 hours.

04:09.083 --> 04:12.030
Dream bigger, hot pants. Step aside.

04:12.086 --> 04:16.933
Sometimes I don't know if I love how much
I fear Claire or fear how much I love her.

04:16.991 --> 04:18.368
Oh.

04:19.692 --> 04:24.233
I have 22nd to the eighth for Alex.
Luke to the 14th.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.938
Haley gets a day there. Come on.

04:27.001 --> 04:29.811
That's it, beautiful mind.
Harness that crazy into something positive.

04:29.870 --> 04:34.182
Shh. if we can get Alex to move her Habitat
for Humanity from Oklahoma to Sacramento...

04:34.241 --> 04:36.346
and Luke to move his camp session...

04:36.410 --> 04:38.856
they will both overlap
with Haley's vacation...

04:38.912 --> 04:41.085
and I just bought us seven kid-free days.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.094
- Witchcraft!
- Yeah.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.988
I've outdone myself, Gloria.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.431
I booked the restaurant
from our first date...

04:48.489 --> 04:50.799
the same table overlooking the ocean...

04:50.858 --> 04:53.998
and I'll do it at sunset, which
I've recently discovered is my ideal lighting.

04:54.061 --> 04:57.065
- That's so romantic.
- I know. isn't it?

04:57.131 --> 04:59.168
Oh. Oh! Oh, okay. Oh, that's Mitchell.

04:59.233 --> 05:02.009
- Gotta go.
- Oh, don't let him hear the excitement in your voice.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.343
You're right. You're right.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.940
What?

05:05.005 --> 05:07.246
I'm at that coffee shop
on Third, and I forgot my wallet.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.948
- Can you come bail me out?
- Oh, isn't this convenient?

05:10.010 --> 05:14.186
It actually was.
I was only two blocks away.

05:14.248 --> 05:18.390
But when I got there, I realized
it was all a ploy so he could propose.

05:18.452 --> 05:22.730
But it was so sweet, I just decided
to ditch my plans and let him do it.

05:34.335 --> 05:38.442
Mitchell, I'm so sorry,
but there is a massive pileup on the 405...

05:38.505 --> 05:40.485
and, well, I have to go pick up Lily.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.817
Maybe you could just call Claire
or something?

05:42.876 --> 05:45.823
Cam. Cam. I got, like,
50 cents to my name.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.552
Have you decided on a tea?

05:47.614 --> 05:49.753
Um-

05:49.817 --> 05:54.129
Do they all cost the same? Yeah.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.464
Look at that line.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.833
Probably everybody
getting their gay marriage license.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.304
I think it's just called
a marriage license.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.731
Yeah, I don't know.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.175
- Maybe we should go home and forget about it.
- What?

06:06.233 --> 06:08.941
I've been reading up
on some of those tropical diseases-

06:09.002 --> 06:11.278
- malaria, yellow fever, rabies.
- Mm-hmm.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.409
I'm high risk, Jay. I'm a big hand shaker.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.976
You're fine. You've had all your shots.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.648
And that Paco Rabanne
will scare away any mosquitoes.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.047
Jay, I'm scared.

06:20.114 --> 06:21.787
I'm not sure I want to go through with it.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.022
We didn't drive all the way down here
for that piece of paper...

06:24.084 --> 06:26.257
for you to get cold feet
at the last second.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.358
And what happened anyway? You've been
looking forward to this day for months.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.029
I know, but maybe we should wait
until next year.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.436
- I'm still kind of young to be doing this.
- We're not waiting.

06:34.495 --> 06:38.807
I already paid for you, and your mother
signed off. This is happening.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.805
Great day, huh?

06:42.870 --> 06:44.543
That's disgusting.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.607
- Hello!
- Oh, thank God.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.175
- Mm-hmm.
- I've had so many cups of tea...

06:48.242 --> 06:49.744
they gave me my own one of these.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.312
Oh. Here you go.

06:51.378 --> 06:54.484
So congratulations
on the whole marriage thing.

06:54.548 --> 06:58.018
- How amazing is that, right?
- Yeah. We gonna hear some big gay wedding bells soon?

06:58.085 --> 07:00.463
- Well, just wedding bells.
- Mmm.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.364
Yeah, yeah. Of course.
We've always talked about it.

07:02.423 --> 07:05.302
But you know, it's just
a matter of finding the right timing.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.997
And then there's
a couple of other factors-

07:07.060 --> 07:09.404
tax implications and estate planning.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.965
Oh, stop. I'm swooning.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.773
I'm just being practical.
You're the same way.

07:13.834 --> 07:17.043
You told Phil to take back your
engagement ring and buy you a washer/dryer.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.015
Don't put this back on me.
Come on.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.881
What is Cam's biggest complaint about you?

07:20.941 --> 07:23.717
You're not romantic.
This is your opportunity.

07:23.777 --> 07:28.157
Mitchell, you should go home tonight
and surprise him with a big, splashy proposal.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.388
He would really like it
if I proposed to him.

07:30.451 --> 07:34.194
- Mm-hmm.
- I guess I could stop after work and pick up a card and-

07:34.254 --> 07:36.234
- Oh, my God. You're hopeless.
- I know.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.201
Mitchell, okay. This is what you do.

07:38.258 --> 07:41.068
- Okay.
- It really should be your own idea though.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.630
No, come on. Come on. I need help.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.505
- Please.
- Fine. Okay.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.705
Tonight you cook him his favorite meal.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.408
You open the best bottle of wine.

07:50.471 --> 07:53.384
And just as the two of you
are sitting down to enjoy it...

07:53.440 --> 07:55.579
- you break up with him.
- What? Why?

07:55.642 --> 07:58.418
Because then, as he is at his lowest,
you pop the question.

07:58.479 --> 08:01.756
He goes from agony to ecstasy!
It's so romantic.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.193
- You're kidding, right?
- More traditional?

08:04.251 --> 08:05.855
- Y-
- All right.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.455
You look into his eyes...

08:07.521 --> 08:12.129
and you say, "I saw a doctor.
He found a small dark mass."

08:12.192 --> 08:14.798
- What are you?
- And then just as he begins to cry...

08:14.862 --> 08:17.433
you pull out a black box
with the ring in it.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.068
There's your small dark mass!

08:19.132 --> 08:21.169
- It's genius!
- Y-You're a disaster.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.771
You could go the disaster route too.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.544
Did you ever hear how I told Phil
we were gonna have Luke?

08:25.606 --> 08:28.985
I said, "Thousands of children
die every day."

08:34.181 --> 08:35.558
Dad?

08:35.616 --> 08:38.153
I'm sorry.
Was I being proud of you too loud?

08:38.217 --> 08:41.756
- What are you doing?
- Going off to Habitat, helping all those people.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.426
Honey, I'm speechless.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.403
- Thanks. I just thought it was-
- But are we sure about Oklahoma?

08:46.460 --> 08:50.169
There's so many needy people right up
in Sacramento. And it's driving distance.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.005
I already signed up for my work detail...

08:52.065 --> 08:53.942
and I've been e-mailing with my tentmate.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.503
Yeah. No, you're right.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.515
I guess it's just-

08:57.571 --> 08:58.606
No.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.583
Never mind.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.143
- What is it?
- No. it's stupid.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.520
I've just never been so far away
from my baby girl before.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.354
Not now, waterworks. Not now.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.325
Oh, Daddy.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.423
- You okay, Dad?
- Oh, hey, buddy.

09:14.488 --> 09:16.627
Never been better. You're so thoughtful.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.364
I'm gonna miss that when you go off
to camp on the 14th. Little Wiffle golf?

09:19.426 --> 09:23.306
Wait. I can't go to camp on the 14th.
I have to go when Carly's going.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.967
- Who's Carly?
- Shh!

09:25.032 --> 09:27.342
She's this girl I like,
and she's here right now.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.707
Well, all the more reason
to change camp sessions.

09:30.771 --> 09:33.183
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
It's foolproof.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.220
Not this fool. Forget it.

09:35.275 --> 09:38.347
What about all the new girls
you're gonna meet? You're only 14.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.914
Do you really wanna be tied down?

09:39.980 --> 09:40.981
Yes!

09:41.048 --> 09:42.789
Oh, Luke. Watch. I-I got it.

09:42.849 --> 09:45.261
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:45.319 --> 09:46.627
Nice!

09:46.687 --> 09:49.258
Oh, hi, Mr. Dunphy.
Sorry we moved the furniture around.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.633
I was showing Luke the flip I did
at tumbling sectionals.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.694
Oh, no. That's my mom.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.831
But I can leave you guys
this old movie I brought over.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.398
It's called Dirty Dancing

09:57.464 --> 10:00.468
Never let her go.

10:00.534 --> 10:03.310
Hey, Carly's mom.
Phil Dunphy. Big fan of your daughter.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.542
Thank you.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.108
So, heads up- Luke's got to
change his camp session.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.176
- You guys may want to do the same.
- No!

10:09.242 --> 10:11.586
My husband and I have been
working the whiteboard all week...

10:11.645 --> 10:14.182
and we just bought three days away from that.

10:14.247 --> 10:17.785
- Ow! it wasn't even me!
- Bank it!

10:17.851 --> 10:20.331
Carly!

10:20.387 --> 10:24.062
Okay, Manny. Remember,
as soon as you land, watch out for Malaria.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.728
Why? I got a shot for that.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.170
- Can we hurry this up?
- No. I'm talking about your cousin Malaria.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.401
- She's coming to pick you up, but
she might have Rubella. - What?

10:30.464 --> 10:33.411
That's her daughter, but make room
in the car because she could have diphtheria.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.107
- Who's Diphtheria?
- Ay. Manny, diphtheria is a disease.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.342
That's why I want you
to be apart from her in the car.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.112
Let's go, Gloria.
Better say good-bye here.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.675
He's got to hurry to get through security.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.688
- But there's no line.
- For now.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.485
A senior tour bus just pulled up.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.252
You know how much private wanding that is?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.918
Half their skeletons are metal.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.623
Ay. Manny, please.
Call me as soon as you land.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.030
- I'll miss you.
- And we're walking.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.227
I love you!

10:57.290 --> 10:58.564
- Wait.
- No. Up!

10:58.625 --> 11:00.571
- I forgot to give Mom this card I wrote.
- No, no.

11:00.627 --> 11:03.767
I'll handle it.
Safe trip, buddy. Safe trip.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.811
- We're out of here.
- No. Let's wait until he gets to the top.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.873
¡Adiós, mi amor!

11:10.937 --> 11:12.814
Who wants ice cream? Huh?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.819
What if he never comes back?

11:14.875 --> 11:17.651
Oh, honey, no one ever leaves home
and doesn't come back.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.247
I did.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.127
Hey, honey.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.289
I've been mulling over
your Sacramento decision.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.856
- It wasn't exactly my-
- Of course I want my baby girl close...

11:28.922 --> 11:30.868
but I gotta get used to you leaving.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.666
Because college-
and knowing you, a great college-

11:33.727 --> 11:36.833
is right around the corner, am I right?

11:36.897 --> 11:39.036
Now Habitat will look good
on an application...

11:39.099 --> 11:41.511
but does Sacramento
really move the needle?

11:41.568 --> 11:43.673
I have another place in mind.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.808
Little hint- it starts with an "El."

11:45.872 --> 11:47.909
El Salvador? Are you serious?

11:47.974 --> 11:51.285
They have an unstable government,
earthquakes-

11:51.344 --> 11:53.984
Boats. Looks like there's a hill.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.790
I'm just saying, you don't push yourself at this
stage, you wind up at a second-tier college.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.353
Soon you've lost all your ambition.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.921
You're just drifting through life...

12:00.987 --> 12:03.558
hoping someone offers you
an M. R.S. degree.

12:06.460 --> 12:07.962
Is that who you want to be?

12:12.999 --> 12:14.876
Hey, princess. Second breakfast?

12:14.935 --> 12:16.937
Fun.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.505
So big beach trip coming up, huh?

12:18.572 --> 12:20.643
- Yeah.
- Can't get better than late July...

12:20.707 --> 12:22.209
- unless it's early August-
- Save it, Dad.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.948
I know you and Mom
want the house to yourselves.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.684
- Nope.
- I'm the last piece of the puzzle, right?

12:26.747 --> 12:29.353
- What's it worth to you?
- Fine.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.487
How about I pay for gas and two dinners?

12:31.551 --> 12:34.122
Mmm. Gas, all dinners...

12:34.187 --> 12:36.428
groceries, two new bathing suits,
a Boogie board-

12:36.490 --> 12:38.299
- Are you crazy?
- No. I'm also not done.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.962
Yes, you are done. You know why?

12:40.026 --> 12:41.699
You know another way this shakes out?
You don't go.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.764
That's right.
Overplay your hand, I pull the plug...

12:43.830 --> 12:45.969
you blow your last chance
for a good time with your friends.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.410
Word gets out that you're not cool,
then school starts.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.311
You end up with your nose
in a book all year.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.874
No friends, no dates,
not caring how you look.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.055
Is that who you want to be?

13:02.983 --> 13:05.520
Turns out Mitchell
really had forgotten his wallet...

13:05.585 --> 13:07.292
so proposing wasn't even on his radar.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.992
My plan was bulletproof.

13:09.055 --> 13:13.504
He was gonna be as blindsided as
the fattest hog on Founders Day, and I was-

13:13.560 --> 13:16.404
Pretty darn proud of myself.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.875
I had the ideal proposal.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.741
Cam once told me that all he wanted...

13:20.801 --> 13:24.010
was someone to sit in a rocking chair
and grow old with, and-

13:24.070 --> 13:26.914
So while we're at dinner,
Claire is setting up two rocking chairs...

13:26.973 --> 13:29.749
next to the fireplace
with a bottle of champagne.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.847
Oh. He is going to-

13:31.912 --> 13:34.358
Squeal like a Berkshire white
in a four-man pig toss.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.951
Gosh durn it, I miss Founders Day.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.122
This is a little bit fancy
for just a quick bite.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.757
Well, who knows if they can
even get us in? Let me check.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.460
Reservation for Tucker.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.025
Is everything set up with the table?

13:45.091 --> 13:46.627
Yeah.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.468
Oh.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.530
The restaurant
where we had our first date...

13:50.597 --> 13:53.134
the sunset lighting that Cam loves.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.737
He was going to propose.

13:55.802 --> 13:58.408
I was so touched, but at the same time...

13:58.471 --> 14:01.645
he was ruining the one chance
I had for romantic redemption.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.415
Oh, I'm feeling really queasy, Cam.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.978
No, you'll be okay once we sit down.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.615
I think I need to go home. Sorry.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.455
Oh! Excuse me. Sorry. No, no, no.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.392
- We'll get you some ginger ale and some crackers.
- Mm-mmm.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.657
I gotta run to the restroom.
You-You grab the car.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.761
You'll feel better after you throw up!

14:17.824 --> 14:19.428
Okay, new plan. We're coming back early.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.166
- Is everything set up?
- You said two hours. We haven't even left yet.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.072
- Well, hurry!
- Just stall.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.633
Tell him that... Haley had a hemorrhage...

14:26.700 --> 14:28.702
and you're her blood type, so you-

14:28.768 --> 14:30.679
I'm not doing that, you ghoul.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.273
Just get back to the house and-

14:32.339 --> 14:34.649
- Gloria.
- Cam. How did it go? Did you-

14:34.708 --> 14:36.585
it didn't happen.
I have to go with the backup plan.

14:36.643 --> 14:40.455
Fortunately, I had an alternate
proposal scenario in case there was a problem.

14:40.513 --> 14:44.893
Jay and Gloria were babysitting, so I asked them
to recreate the picnic under the stars we had...

14:44.951 --> 14:46.726
the night we moved into
our first apartment.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.959
Mitchell would take one look and-

14:49.022 --> 14:51.866
Sob like a Tony winner.

14:56.963 --> 15:00.467
I got the picnic basket, but you know
what is going to be hard to find?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.342
My interest in this whole damn thing?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.404
No. The blue and white tablecloth.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.644
Here it is. it was in the occasion closet.

15:06.706 --> 15:10.176
They keep their tools in a pillowcase,
but they have an occasions closet.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.148
What are you guys doing here?

15:13.213 --> 15:16.683
Oh, Cam is going to propose to Mitch,
so we're here to help him set it up.

15:16.750 --> 15:21.096
That is coconuts. Mitchell asked us
to do the same thing for him.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.657
That just makes me want to stay
and see how this whole thing works out.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.669
We can. Let's set it up,
and then we'll hide somewhere.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.363
Ay. yes, in the occasion closet.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.271
No. We do what they asked and leave.
We never had these problems.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.674
This is what happens
when they let men marry men.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.645
That cannot be a coincidence.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.511
I'm sorry about the detour. I was just
worried about the pileup on the 405.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.713
Oh, take your time.
The drive's actually soothing me.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.279
Oh! Oh, my gosh!

15:45.345 --> 15:47.518
- Oh! Wh-What was that?
- I think it's a blown tire.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.254
- It's okay.
- I know there's a spare. Do-Do we have the tools?

15:50.317 --> 15:52.126
Yeah, yeah.
They're in the pillowcase in the trunk.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.186
Right.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.358
Why do you have to be so grouchy?

15:55.422 --> 15:57.402
We're giving them a beautiful story.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.869
Everybody deserves one.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.099
- I'm an idiot.
- No, you're not an idiot.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.664
You're not as romantic as some-

16:03.730 --> 16:06.210
These things peel off on the back,
and I've been gluing 'em.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.110
Why do I even bother?
You don't care about this stuff.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.739
What's that supposed to mean?

16:10.804 --> 16:12.374
Yeah, like when you proposed to me-

16:12.439 --> 16:15.079
"Hey, Manny, hand me that thing."
That's my whole story.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.917
Hang on. That wasn't my fault.
I had something big planned.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.548
You asked him for the ring.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.888
I was asking for the remote.
He jumped the gun.

16:21.948 --> 16:25.020
He was supposed to give me the ring
later that night at the restaurant.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.463
The waiter was gonna come by
and offer coffee.

16:27.520 --> 16:31.366
I was gonna say, "No, thank you. It'll keep
me up, and lately I've been loving my dreams.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.927
And there's one in particular
I hope comes true."

16:33.994 --> 16:36.736
Manny gives me the ring. I say, "Gloria"-

16:36.796 --> 16:40.107
Yes, Jay! Yes, I marry you!

16:40.166 --> 16:42.703
I love my new story.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.910
Little heads-up- there's no way
I'm not crying at this wedding.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.750
Phil, you cried on the way here.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.721
I was on the brink already.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.986
I watched Dirty Dancing before we left.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.686
I know.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.488
Text from my dad. Oh, no.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.624
He wants me to come visit him
for a couple of days...

17:02.689 --> 17:04.691
but it's right in the middle
of our kid-free week.

17:04.758 --> 17:08.171
Oh, that's too bad,
but I guess you could take two days, hmm?

17:08.228 --> 17:12.369
I may have mentioned to Frank
that Phil might be available that week.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.173
The only thing better
than a kid-free week...

17:14.233 --> 17:17.113
is a couple of days carved out
just for Mama.

17:18.972 --> 17:20.041
Perfect.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.550
Yeah.

17:22.976 --> 17:26.116
- Hey, you remember the day I proposed to you?
- Of course I do.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.920
I don't remember the exact date, but yes.

17:27.981 --> 17:30.120
March 19, 1994.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.528
Oh, yeah.
I was in such a bad mood that afternoon.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.998
I was on day two
of a St. Patrick's hangover.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.036
- I don't remember that.
- Mmm.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.298
I just remember how crazy in love I was.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.636
- Mmm.
- I couldn't wait to ask you.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.471
I even ran a red light
on the way to pick you up.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.479
I still have the ticket.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.481
No, you don't.
Why would you save something like that?

17:50.537 --> 17:52.813
Are you kidding me?
I was racing to my life.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.250
It's in a box at my dad's
with a bunch of other stuff-

17:55.308 --> 17:57.481
The program from that concert
where I met you.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.483
The matchbook
with the fake number on it you gave me.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.552
The souvenir goblet from our first date.

18:04.617 --> 18:10.590
You really think I'd throw away
all those beautiful memories, milady?

18:14.861 --> 18:16.738
I haven't seen that stuff for a long time.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.469
I gotta dig it out when I see my dad.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.068
- Okay, stop. Sorry.
- What?

18:21.134 --> 18:23.478
I told your dad to call you...

18:23.536 --> 18:26.210
because I wanted some time for myself.

18:26.272 --> 18:31.153
Yeah. Couple of days away from
my perfect, romantic husband...

18:31.211 --> 18:35.819
who is far too good for this coldhearted,
bloodless wife-bot.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.953
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.655
You have blood.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.166
Honey, I just put the chairs in front of
the fireplace. You made it romantic.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.999
Mitchell's right. I'm a ghoul.

18:46.059 --> 18:47.800
Come here.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.866
You're romantic too,
in your own funny way.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.241
- We're just different.
- Mmm.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.541
So what if I'm more sentimental?

18:56.603 --> 18:58.105
My mom.

18:58.171 --> 19:01.709
I mean, sure, marriage needs romance.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.276
You know what it also needs?

19:03.343 --> 19:06.153
"Spoke to Phil, and he suggested"-

19:06.212 --> 19:08.021
Forgiveness.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.026
Okay. Spare, please.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.928
Yes, Doctor.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.763
Can't believe this has happened to us
so many times, we actually have a system.

19:16.823 --> 19:20.327
Oh, I know. You've come a long way
from the first time you ever saw a jack.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.566
- Remember, you couldn't believe-
- I'm sorry. This is amazing.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.302
I am lifting a car right now.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.401
I'm the strongest man in the world.

19:26.466 --> 19:30.141
Oh. Do you remember that time in Yosemite
when it was snowing so bad?

19:30.203 --> 19:31.773
Yeah. What was that, like, six years ago?

19:31.838 --> 19:33.340
Oh, gosh, no. it was before Lily...

19:33.406 --> 19:35.977
so it was at least seven or eight.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.352
God, it is- it's going by so fast.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.254
Yeah. You're telling me.

19:43.183 --> 19:46.494
You know, it's a different world down there
than it was 24 hours ago.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.861
Hmm.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.195
Cam, tire. Tire!

19:49.255 --> 19:51.166
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my- Oh, my God.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.500
Oh, my God!

19:53.560 --> 19:56.040
It's gonna be a different world
for the people in that yellow house.

19:59.098 --> 20:02.739
This is not at all
how I saw the evening going.

20:02.802 --> 20:06.147
Oh. Honey, you have no idea.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.345
Do you remember our first apartment?

20:10.410 --> 20:13.186
Yes. What- What made you think of that?

20:13.246 --> 20:15.590
I don't know.

20:15.648 --> 20:16.991
The stars.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.858
All right. Come on. Let's do this.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.093
Yeah.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.979
- Yes.
- Yes.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.445
Hey, there.
You with the stars on your thighs.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.648
- Huh?
- It's an old song.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.625
I thought I would- Ah, why do I bother?

20:49.716 --> 20:51.252
- What is this?
- Oh, that's from Manny.

20:51.317 --> 20:55.288
I was hoping to wait and give it to you
in a couple of days, but, uh-

20:55.355 --> 20:57.301
Just remember that he's fine.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.530
He's only a plane ride away.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.402
Nice. I'm going to wash my face.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.100
Okay.

21:04.163 --> 21:08.976
I hope that my cousins don't take him
riding the horses or shooting the guns.

21:09.035 --> 21:12.608
I know that he's almost a man, but-

21:14.774 --> 21:17.880
- Jay?
- "Make sure you take care of Jay.

21:17.944 --> 21:21.391
Please call me after his checkup
on Thursday.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.256
I'll miss you guys so much."

21:23.316 --> 21:25.819
- Nice, huh?
- Nice?

21:27.220 --> 21:29.166
I'm gonna mail him his other robe.
