WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:03.104
- It's in the shop.

00:03.137 --> 00:05.539
Some lady side-swanked me.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.007
No.
- Yeah.

00:07.041 --> 00:10.778
- Well, no worries, we get a
little quality time together.

00:10.811 --> 00:11.979
- Exactly.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.182
- I don't want
to hurt your feelings,

00:14.215 --> 00:17.585
But when we get to the auction,

00:17.618 --> 00:19.620
I'm probably going
to have you kind of like,

00:19.653 --> 00:21.222
duck down, or sneak out--
- Okay.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.690
- Because--
- Yeah, because--

00:22.723 --> 00:24.625
- I don't really want everyone
giving me a bunch of crap.

00:28.696 --> 00:29.897
- No, we're not in yet.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.065
- You got to wait.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.304
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:36.337 --> 00:38.672
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:38.706 --> 00:40.174
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:40.208 --> 00:42.176
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.511
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.845
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:44.878 --> 00:46.547
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:46.580 --> 00:48.082
- You shut your face.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.251
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.419
- We're back, baby!

00:54.355 --> 00:56.257
- Today,
we're in Thousand Oaks.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.758
Pretty far
from my house, you know.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.560
So I don't go
out there very often.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.629
Years ago, I used to run
all over Southern California,

01:01.662 --> 01:03.164
in my younger days.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.933
So it'll be a good old drive
to visit old friends, you know?

01:05.966 --> 01:07.901
Believe it or not,
some people like me.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.737
Not a lot, but some.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.472
When you have
a lot of foes in the world,

01:11.505 --> 01:13.040
it's best to take
your friends with you.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.008
Hey, I got one in the backseat.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.677
My road dog.

01:16.710 --> 01:20.114
*

01:20.148 --> 01:21.982
- Yep.

01:22.015 --> 01:23.851
- They can't handle one of me,
they can't handle two of me.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.119
This is a nice area,

01:25.153 --> 01:26.754
so I asked my brother,
Jay, to meet me here,

01:26.787 --> 01:28.189
just in case I hit the jackpot.

01:30.358 --> 01:32.126
- That's my little brother.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.561
- Yeah.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.863
My brother, Carl,
gave me a surprise visit

01:35.896 --> 01:38.666
coming from Hawaii,
so I gave him a surprise.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.769
I took his ass to the auction.
Surprise!

01:41.802 --> 01:43.337
- That's my brother.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.572
- Little brother
or big brother?

01:44.605 --> 01:45.906
- Hey, that's
Sergeant Jamar right there.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.741
All right, military?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.877
- Yes, I am.
- Right on, right on.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.313
No one told me it was
bring your brother to work day.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.215
- Good morning!
all: Hey, Emily.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.250
- Emily, this is my
brother right here, Carl.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.652
Carl, that's Emily
- Carl, hi, nice to meet you.

01:58.686 --> 02:03.457
- Hey, guys, hey, Emily.

02:03.491 --> 02:04.992
- Kenny.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.494
- Kumbaya, southern belle.
- Kumbaya.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.329
- This is my brother, Jamar.
- Nice to meet you, I'm Mary.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.565
- Carl.
- Carl, nice to meet you, Carl.

02:11.599 --> 02:14.268
- Hey, it's my
favorite female buyer.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.804
- Get out of here, Dave.
- Hi, Mary.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.340
- Uh, you know who's
not my favorite buyer?

02:19.373 --> 02:22.976
Well, Rene.
But Dave's a close second.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.412
- That was not a warm welcome.

02:24.445 --> 02:27.448
- It's like a bug coming.
- I was going to be nicer,

02:27.481 --> 02:30.318
but now she's
on my  list.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.552
- Oh, dear.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.521
- At least she knows
the big buyer's here now.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.088
- Thanks for coming out today
to Thousand Oaks.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.291
My name is Emily, I'm going
to be your auctioneer today.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.926
Once I open the door,
you can't go in

02:38.959 --> 02:40.961
and you can't touch anything,
but everybody will get a chance

02:40.994 --> 02:43.130
to look.
This is a cash only auction.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.265
If you have
cash in your pocket,

02:44.298 --> 02:45.733
that means that
you can buy today.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.435
And if you guys are ready
to see the units, so am I.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.002
Let's go!
- Whoo!

02:49.036 --> 02:50.438
Let's get it on and cracking!

02:50.471 --> 02:53.607
- Out of here, Dave.
Competition from the get-go.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.509
- She is fierce.
- Beware of me.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.978
- Uh-oh.
- Right this way!

02:59.380 --> 03:01.382
Here we go, guys.
A ten by ten.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.351
- Ten by ten,
Mary likes ten by tens.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.919
- Normally, I wouldn't
bid against her--

03:05.953 --> 03:07.388
- Okay, got it, Dave.
- Sensing a little

03:07.421 --> 03:09.790
attitude today.
Sorry, Mary.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.260
You got to wait behind me.
Oh, my God, look at that.

03:12.293 --> 03:15.496
Well, there's a table base.
An old '70s nightstand.

03:15.529 --> 03:19.767
Some boxes, it's probably worth
a bid for the right price.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.535
- It's all boxes, so
everything's neatly organized.

03:21.569 --> 03:22.970
These people took pride
in what they got.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.338
Everything's easy.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.340
Take it out, put it in
the truck, we're on the way.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.841
So it's definitely something
we're going to bid on.

03:27.875 --> 03:28.876
- Let's get it.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.311
- Uh, let's see.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.313
There's probably trinkets
galore in those boxes.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.881
Depending on the price, I'm in.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.783
- Oh, it's a bad sell.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.418
Do you see what I see, Carl?

03:37.451 --> 03:39.019
- I see a toaster oven
up in there.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.554
- They got some
furnitures in here, too.

03:40.588 --> 03:43.691
1979-era furniture right there.
- We got a table right here.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.892
- That ain't even
much of a table, bruh.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.193
That'll get some--

03:46.226 --> 03:48.329
- Yes, ma'am.
- Take your time, please.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.597
By all means.
- Don't look her

03:49.630 --> 03:51.965
in the eyes, bruh.
Just keep going.

03:51.999 --> 03:55.135
- Jeez O'Petes.
- Save your energy for lunch.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.470
- All righty, guys, here we go.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.539
And what do you say, there,
and how about 300?

03:58.572 --> 04:00.107
And 300--
- Yup!

04:00.140 --> 04:01.942
I've got 300, how about 400,

04:01.975 --> 04:04.111
- So annoying.
- I've got 300, how about 350.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.379
Give me 3 and a half, I've got
3 and half, how about 4?

04:05.413 --> 04:06.547
Bidding at 400,
I'm looking for 400,

04:06.580 --> 04:08.849
- Annoying!
A mosquito behind me.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.384
- Yup!
- No more of that.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.420
And 550, am I going to get 600?
I'm at 5 and a half and 6.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.521
- Yeah!
- And 5 and a half, and 6,

04:13.554 --> 04:14.722
and 7, 7's the current bid.
- Yup!

04:14.755 --> 04:16.757
- Oh!
- 750, 7 and a half, and 8,

04:16.790 --> 04:18.091
I'm looking at 8 from 750,
can I get 8 and a half?

04:18.125 --> 04:19.727
850, going to bid?
- Yup!

04:19.760 --> 04:21.962
- Oh, my God, I hear you!
- 850, I'm looking at 9,

04:21.995 --> 04:23.797
9, 850, looking at 9,
- I don't have it.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.466
Going now 850,
going to bid 900?

04:25.499 --> 04:28.201
Sold it to you, $850.
Dave got it for 850.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.703
Let's go, guys, moving on.
- Okay, you got one.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.705
So can you shut up now
for the rest of the auction?

04:31.739 --> 04:33.407
- Uh, no.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.908
Yeah, I got the locker.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.878
But more importantly, I'm
really starting to get to Mary.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.680
- Right this way,
ladies and gents.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.416
Around the corner,
not that far.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.454
Here we go, five by ten.

04:46.487 --> 04:50.891
*

04:50.924 --> 04:53.927
- Hmm, little wine deal.
China, crystal.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.629
I like those boxes,
the way they're labeled,

04:55.663 --> 04:58.366
but I'll make my mind up
when the bidding starts.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.401
- Some of the stuff in here
doesn't look high quality.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.135
But then they've got
good names on the boxes.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.571
This is definitely
a gamble unit,

05:03.604 --> 05:04.905
and that's what
I'm in the business for.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.740
- There's some good
pieces of furniture in here.

05:06.774 --> 05:10.143
And maybe some trinkets,
because it says crystal, china.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.179
- No, that's their
daughter's names.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.981
- This is a good little
unit in there.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.549
- They got a helmet,
I mean a military helmet.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.750
It's a soldier boy's unit.

05:16.784 --> 05:17.985
- Ooh, they might got
some good weapons.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.353
- That's a real nice helmet.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.321
- Might be a little
diamond in the rough in here.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.890
What do you say, 150,
going to bid one and a half?

05:22.923 --> 05:24.257
- Yup!
- Going to 2, got to bid

05:24.291 --> 05:25.526
2 and a half, got a bid at 2,
I've got to get 250.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.527
250, going to bid
two and a half,

05:26.560 --> 05:27.795
- Cheating.
- Yeah!

05:27.828 --> 05:29.029
- Right here, yup.
- Looking at 3 and a half,

05:29.062 --> 05:30.798
going to bid, 4,
at 350, looking to make it 4,

05:30.831 --> 05:32.265
4, 4, I'm looking at 400,
4 and a half,

05:32.299 --> 05:33.934
I'm looking at 450, 450,
- Nah.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.736
- Go with that unit.
Get in there, man.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.538
Can't score if you don't
get in the game.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.673
- I'm looking for 550,
got a bid of 500, 550,

05:39.707 --> 05:41.108
Can I get 550?

05:41.141 --> 05:43.411
Sold it to you, Kenny.
Kenny got it for 500.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.412
Kenny got it.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.146
- It's all in the eyes.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.450
In the army now.
- Oh, yeah.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.351
- You are!
heavy, boy.

05:51.385 --> 05:54.388
I ain't going to lie.
I'm going to war, kumbaya.

05:54.422 --> 05:56.957
America, you're safe
with soldier Kenny.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.196
- This way, guys!

06:03.230 --> 06:04.998
Another big unit here!

06:07.401 --> 06:11.004
*

06:11.038 --> 06:13.073
- So, we've got pool sticks,
so I'm guessing that

06:13.106 --> 06:15.175
what's hidden right there
is going to be a pool table.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.311
Low end furniture in the back,
might be worth a few dollars.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.548
- Now, this is probably
a pool table right there.

06:20.581 --> 06:21.982
And it's all put together.

06:22.015 --> 06:25.152
Some young energetic young man
might want to buy this.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.320
- Mary, you could live, you
could like, live in this unit.

06:27.354 --> 06:28.822
- Ooh.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.558
I mean, there's probably
some good stuff in there.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.959
Like that rocking horse,
and stuff.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.527
But it's just too big for me.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.395
I'm going to pass.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.297
- By the time you finish
cleaning this unit out,

06:37.330 --> 06:38.832
your ass is going
to be 30 pounds lighter.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.267
Your wife ain't going
to recognize you, boy.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.869
- Just saying, think about it.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.203
- There's one good thing
in there, Emily.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.639
- One good thing for sure.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.274
Point it out, what is it?

06:47.307 --> 06:48.542
- From right here,
can I see it?

06:48.576 --> 06:50.343
- Yes.
- I don't see it.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.747
- It's a good day's work.

06:55.315 --> 06:56.517
- All right, guys, here we go.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.285
Nice big unit,
lot of potential.

06:58.318 --> 07:00.454
And what are you saying, 100,

07:00.488 --> 07:02.623
50, let's go to 50,
- Yeah!

07:02.656 --> 07:04.124
And 50, going to bid 75,

07:04.157 --> 07:06.326
- Get in there, Mary.
- You get in there, Dave.

07:06.359 --> 07:07.427
- Yeah!
- And 100, now a quarter 100,

07:08.696 --> 07:10.731
- It's your turn to bid, Mary.
- Shut up, Dave.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.265
- Yeah!
- Going to 1 and a half, 175,

07:12.299 --> 07:13.634
- Run it up, Mary.
- 175, 175, and 200,

07:14.835 --> 07:15.869
175, I'm looking at 200,
can I get 200?

07:15.903 --> 07:17.370
- Yeah!
- Mary, you're out.

07:17.404 --> 07:19.973
- Shut up!
- 200, am I going to get 225,

07:20.007 --> 07:21.108
- Yeah,
- 200, you're already in.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.676
You want to raise your bid?
- No.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.177
- 225, can I get
2 and a quarter,

07:25.679 --> 07:27.615
Sold it to you, Justin.
Got it for $200.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.116
- I got this locker
for so cheap,

07:29.149 --> 07:31.051
I might even buy
my brother lunch today.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.520
- All right, guys,
that's going to do it.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.054
Last unit of the day.
See me in the office

07:34.087 --> 07:36.790
and pay before you leave.
See you next time.

07:36.824 --> 07:37.991
Mary, you didn't
get anything today.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.927
- I know, dang it.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.329
- So now how long do I have
to wait for you to finish?

07:42.362 --> 07:43.564
- Like five minutes.
- Oh, cool.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.632
Then we'll be on the way.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.700
- Today did not
work out for me.

07:46.734 --> 07:50.037
At least I get to leave here
and spend time with my gal pal.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.939
- Let's go, like, thrift shop.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.106
- Sweet!

07:55.008 --> 07:57.144
- This is why I'm
one of the big buyers now.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.779
I only paid
200 bucks for this,

07:58.812 --> 08:01.281
so I better end up looking good
in front of my older brother.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.116
*

08:03.150 --> 08:04.585
- All clothes.
- $10 box.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.620
This microwave,
it's a little bit dirty.

08:06.654 --> 08:10.023
Once you put that Justin
shine on it, $20 microwave.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.592
That's cool, so this is, like,
you put around your patio,

08:11.625 --> 08:12.660
on a canopy.
- Like a mist.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.194
- So a mister.
- That's 15 bucks.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.764
- On a hot summer day, 40 bucks
for that thing right there.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.266
Easily.
Oh, wow, this is nice, too.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.568
$20 lamp.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.703
But this...

08:22.736 --> 08:24.004
Pays for the whole unit.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.138
You know how much
these things go for?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.439
200 bucks, right there.

08:26.473 --> 08:27.841
That means
everything right here,

08:27.875 --> 08:30.544
nothing but profit, baby.
I see a money box!

08:30.578 --> 08:33.647
*

08:33.681 --> 08:36.149
- Sounds empty.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.719
Yup, it's empty.
But it's cool, though.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.921
For swap meets,
we'll just keep that one.

08:40.954 --> 08:43.356
Got some pool table sticks.
So I see one, two, three--

08:43.390 --> 08:44.858
- One, two, three, four.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.861
We'll make about 25 bucks.
Oh, brake pad.

08:47.895 --> 08:48.929
- That's brand new.
- Brand new brake pads.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.130
About 50 bucks.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.398
- What do you think
we can get for this?

08:51.431 --> 08:53.901
- About 40 bucks.
- And now you're on the money.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.136
Are these for a saw?
- No, this is like disc brakes,

08:56.169 --> 08:58.505
for a bike.
About 35 bucks.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.941
- 50 bucks right there
on the futon.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.710
We got four sleeping bags.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.244
Ten bucks apiece
on sleeping bags.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.312
- 40 bucks.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.647
All right.
- A little headboard.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.181
- You know, this has the
little sticky things on it,

09:08.215 --> 09:10.217
but once we've wiped it down,
we can get 50 bucks for this.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.920
What's this?
Whoo-hoo!

09:12.953 --> 09:14.154
And is this thing in here?

09:14.187 --> 09:16.156
These things can be worth
a lot of money.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.595
Let's go, baby!
That's what I'm talking about.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.897
Look, brand new, still has
all the pieces in it.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.533
Oh, my gosh, this is beautiful.
This is definitely something

09:26.566 --> 09:27.768
that I wanna
get checked out, man.

09:27.801 --> 09:28.902
- There's another one
back here.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.672
You're joking.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.674
Oh, my God.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.876
This thing is
freaking nice, man.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.911
Has everything in here?
- Has everything, batteries.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.047
- Yeah, we've got to put these
things off to the side, man.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.749
This is a nice table here.
Ten bucks.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.317
Ten bucks on that one,
15 on the bigger one.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.654
This one right here,
probably get 25 bucks on that.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.455
This is pretty neat.
50 bucks, easily.

09:48.488 --> 09:51.992
Found the sticks, now I'm
hoping that this is a table.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.394
Ah, this is a table.
This is beautiful.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.495
This the one's that you see

09:55.528 --> 09:56.997
in the pool halls
and all that stuff.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.799
Good material, very sturdy.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.533
Doesn't have any tears,
as you can see.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.202
Once we put a
nice little wipe down,

10:02.235 --> 10:04.938
we can easily get 800 bucks
for this thing, easy.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.474
That's how we do it, baby.
- You're making me a believer.

10:07.507 --> 10:08.942
- I told you, man.
Plus, I've still got to

10:08.976 --> 10:10.811
get those boats checked out.
- I better not get anything

10:10.844 --> 10:12.245
for my birthday
out of this locker.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.714
- I think I already
saw your gift.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.652
- Let's see what this crystal
and china is about, man.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.453
- Man, you going to get your
head put in a hospital,

10:20.487 --> 10:22.489
you keep talking about
china and crystal.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.357
I hope I make money
off of this unit.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.660
Because I've got to take Carl
back to the airport.

10:26.694 --> 10:29.096
And I know he ain't
going to give me no gas money.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.330
We going to go
through this quick.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.666
Let's look at this here.
Fungus, nothing.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.901
- Let's go through
the goodies, man.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.268
- I'm trying to find
the goodies.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.204
Okay, we've got some
souvenir fishes.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.371
- Uh-huh.
- You could sell this

10:38.405 --> 10:40.540
for how much?
- Ten dollars.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.109
- Pictures.
- Coca-cola, hold up, now.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.811
Hey, that's pretty cool.
- That's kind of old.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.979
Look at this, Carl.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.614
Sexy, huh?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.883
- Bruce Leroy.
- This here's pretty good, boy.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.185
I'd say that's about
150 for the box.

10:52.219 --> 10:55.555
- Come on, Carl, let me out.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.924
- Oh.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.092
- Oh, yeah, you could go back
to Hawaii on this, Carl.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.794
- That might be good, bro.
- I'm going to go with $40

11:00.828 --> 11:06.199
on this ship right here, yeah?

11:06.233 --> 11:07.434
- Cross your fingers.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.902
Oh, , we've got
some stuff in here, boy.

11:08.936 --> 11:12.572
- These little wine glasses.
- That's your girl, crystal.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.942
Oh, sounds like money, boy.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.211
I say this right here
is a $300 dollar box.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.580
- Here.
- Nice little military tent.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.916
Probably sell this
for 100 bucks.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.387
- Empty bottle of
"Martini Rossassy,"

11:27.420 --> 11:28.655
er, "tassi," no money.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.292
- Some pictures, bruh.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.626
- Probably some
good pictures, man.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.329
- For all this here,
I'd say about 100 bucks, bro.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.967
Nice, nice work, Carl.
Sell this for 50 bucks.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.368
Pretty nice table.
- Can we get this

11:41.401 --> 11:43.070
shipped out to Hawaii?

11:43.103 --> 11:45.405
You going to pay for it?

11:45.438 --> 11:46.840
- No.
- Thank you.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.742
Cable chains,
look like brand new.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.677
20 bucks for some chains.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.946
- I have the power!

11:52.980 --> 11:56.649
- You look like Greyskull,
with your crazy looking ass.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.351
- Stop it.
- Come on, Carl.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.988
What is that?
Is this Humpty

12:01.021 --> 12:03.156
We got to put it all
back together again.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.192
- Some pipes.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.160
- One pipe taller
than the other pipe.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.262
Then another pipe
taller than another pipe.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.431
What you think about the pipes?

12:11.464 --> 12:13.233
Keep that going.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.634
Yeah.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.304
* I think these pipes
are worth this *

12:17.337 --> 12:19.606
Yeah.
- I think that's a clock.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.474
- Grandfather clock.
I'm going to take them pieces,

12:21.508 --> 12:25.212
and get it checked out, and
I bet it's worth some money.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.980
Sounds like
a dinner bell to me.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.082
- You're going to have to come
help me with this one, bruh.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.884
box
is light as a--

12:30.918 --> 12:32.019
, weakling.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.387
- I just wanted
to see you carry it.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.789
This is not--

12:35.823 --> 12:37.757
- Put some rice in here, boy.
I know what this is.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.027
- Yes, I would like some, sir.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.529
- Here you go, a cup of tea.
- Come on, get up in there.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.798
Come on, Carl.
You coming.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.467
If this some more china, bruh,
we in the money, boy.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.103
- Voila!
- Oh, yeah, more of it.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.105
This a full set
right here, boy.

12:52.139 --> 12:55.408
I'ma say each box is like
200 each, bruh.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.443
Carl?

12:56.476 --> 12:59.446
- Kenny...

13:02.449 --> 13:05.185
- Time to see what I got
for 850 bucks, Jose.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.786
- Hope you got
good stuff, man.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.756
- I always buy good stuff.
Don't you know that?

13:09.789 --> 13:13.326
Ta-da.
Wow, look at that.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.928
All right, I think I'm going
to start digging.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.729
Just keep
bringing me boxes, okay?

13:16.763 --> 13:18.798
Let's see how my luck is today.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.167
*

13:20.200 --> 13:24.271
This definitely looks like
the kitchen, it sucks.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.139
25 dollars in that box.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.441
Got like 50 dollars
in pots and pans there.

13:28.475 --> 13:32.846
Nice old '60s style lamp.
Worth about 70 bucks.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.048
Oh, another one of those
70 dollar lamps.

13:35.082 --> 13:38.718
Now I got a matching pair.
This one says fragile on it.

13:38.751 --> 13:41.488
So now, we're getting
to the fragile box.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.791
Ooh, ooh.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.128
Asian imari plate.
That's at least 50 bucks.

13:48.161 --> 13:52.132
What we got in here?
Oh, yeah, Italian porcelain.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.035
150 bucks right there.
Another big piece.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.336
I'm going to say
that's probably worth

13:56.369 --> 13:57.837
a couple hundred dollars.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.807
Couple plaster lamps,
50 bucks right there.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.243
Jewelry box, right here, baby.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.012
Ha, nope.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.514
It's a nice box, though.
40 bucks.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.849
*

14:09.883 --> 14:12.986
Huh, let's see
what we got here.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.456
It's stainless.
About 10 dollars a setting.

14:16.489 --> 14:21.028
Seven, eight, nine.
So there's 90 bucks right here.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.097
Some mother of pearl spoons,
which those are sterling.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.499
Ooh, Gump's.
Everybody knows Gump's.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.568
I bet they pay $150.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.371
Souvenir spoons,
$60 right there.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.206
And another 100 bucks here.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.641
Well, I still got
all of the big stuff

14:34.674 --> 14:37.477
in the unit to go through.
Wake up, Jose, come on, man.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.745
You look like
a log on the bench,

14:38.778 --> 14:41.548
a bump on the log,
whatever they call that.

14:41.581 --> 14:45.552
You know, these cabinets and
sofa are probably 200 bucks.

14:45.585 --> 14:49.322
We got a Spanish Mediterranean
bedroom set out of the 1950s.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.624
Probably about 500 bucks today.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.961
This is the very cool
piece right here.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.629
So this is all wood.
All right, lay it on there.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.798
This is a
$1000 table right there.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.733
Very cool, modernism.

15:00.767 --> 15:01.868
Let's get this out of the way.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.336
I want to see
what's in this corner.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.273
All right, that's good.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.508
These little Devon cabinets,
100 bucks here.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.410
And I got a
$100 headboard here.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.744
So not a bad day's work.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.246
Let's go get
our equipment, Jose.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.447
- All right, man.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.086
*

15:19.119 --> 15:20.720
- I'm here at
Apollo Park Lake

15:20.753 --> 15:22.489
to float my boats
by Peter Moore.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.191
Owner of High Desert Hobbies.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.093
Peter, right?
- Ah, yes, good morning.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.760
- Justin.
- Nice meeting you.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.362
- So I heard that you're
the expert on all this stuff,

15:29.396 --> 15:31.464
so, uh, I came to see
what I got.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.967
- Yeah, let's
open them up over here.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.702
- Yeah, they look
brand new to me.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.704
- I don't even know
if it's actually hit water.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.772
- Absolutely.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.441
- Does it look like we have
everything here so far?

15:41.474 --> 15:43.076
- So far,
it looks really, pretty good.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.345
RC boat, radio controlled
boats are fantastic.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.813
It's a great hobby.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.248
Looks like
everything's in shape.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.417
We can put it through her paces
and see what happens.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.319
What we could do
is start by probably just

15:52.352 --> 15:53.953
velcroing these
two batteries down.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.788
And you do need that, because
these do draw a lot of power.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.258
- Yeah.
- Cell number two is 4.18.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.959
Which is balanced.
So both batteries

15:59.993 --> 16:02.062
are in really good shape.
The transmitter's linked

16:02.095 --> 16:04.464
to the radio system,
so the receiver

16:04.497 --> 16:05.898
is sending a signal
and everything.

16:05.932 --> 16:11.771
So we know this receiver works
with this radio system.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.906
- Channel two, that's good.
Everything looks good.
Channel two, that'

16:13.940 --> 16:17.344
So why are we not functioning,
is the question.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.979
The pasture looks fine.
Channel one is the steering,

16:20.013 --> 16:22.249
and it obviously
is functioning well.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.384
More than likely, the thing
burned up, stopped working,

16:24.417 --> 16:26.753
and they kind of
put it on a shelf or whatever.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.489
If you spent 80 or 100 dollars
to replace the speed control,

16:29.522 --> 16:31.291
the value of the boat
actually is there.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.193
Yeah, that's one reason they're
designed the way they are.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.927
Every component on here
can be replaced.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.363
- You know, it sucks
that this one doesn't work,

16:36.396 --> 16:38.365
but I'm hoping
that the second one does.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.167
- Okay, she is a beaut.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.534
- This looks in
pristine condition

16:41.568 --> 16:43.303
- This is actually
a very new boat.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.205
It's a machine
aluminum running gear,

16:45.238 --> 16:46.373
The prop's in great shape.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.374
- See, I love the way
you're talking.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.641
But you told me that
on the last one,

16:48.675 --> 16:49.809
and you know, it came out
to be a big mess.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.112
- Yeah, well,
electronics are tricky.

16:55.948 --> 16:58.418
- Oh, that sounds beautiful.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.686
- Everything looks really good.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.721
- So how much can I get
for everything combined?

17:01.754 --> 17:03.623
- Well, once you get them
up and running,

17:04.991 --> 17:07.427
It would be 650.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.129
- Yup.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.664
- Let's go,
triple my investment.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.134
Enough talk,
let's see this thing in action.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.503
That thing's pretty awesome.
- That's a great boat.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.837
- Ha.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.372
*

17:19.406 --> 17:21.108
- Might want to keep it.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.842
- That thing's cool.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.544
- Well, it's a great hobby.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.681
- Hope I can chime my way

17:28.715 --> 17:31.151
into some more moneys
right here, boy.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.952
- Good morning, Kenny.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.922
I came to see Tom Baker
about these clock pieces.

17:35.955 --> 17:39.326
I heard he knows a thing or two
about a thing or two.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.162
- And a good morning to you.
- Same to you, brother man.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.564
Ivy referred me to you.
He said you go through

17:44.597 --> 17:46.233
a lot of his technical stuff.

17:46.266 --> 17:50.203
- Grandma's Attic is hotter
than my grandma's attic.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.339
- I'm just gonna ignore that.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.641
- I got some chimes, I think,

17:54.674 --> 17:56.843
that might be
worth a little money.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.678
- Some serious stuff here.
- So tell me.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.980
Why do they call this
a grandfather clock?

18:01.013 --> 18:05.084
- It actually came from a song
called "My Grandfather's Clock"

18:05.118 --> 18:07.987
written by
Henry Clay Work in 1875.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.157
- I'ma look that up.
You think it's on Spotify?

18:10.190 --> 18:11.591
- Yeah, probably.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.626
- In anapestic tetrameter,

18:13.660 --> 18:15.695
which is that
syncopation of the song.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.063
- That's where the word
grandfather clock came from?

18:17.096 --> 18:18.097
- Yeah, that's
where the word came from.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.599
Grandfather clock
came from, yeah.

18:19.632 --> 18:23.503
- Man, you learn something new
every day around here, huh?

18:23.536 --> 18:26.539
Tom, I don't know what this is.
When I first got this here,

18:26.573 --> 18:28.141
I thought this was
like a wand or something.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.410
Do it, hi-yah,
you know, like this.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.011
- Your behavior, I'm going to
ignore it for a moment,

18:32.044 --> 18:33.946
but yeah, let's move on.
Can we do that, please?

18:33.980 --> 18:35.815
- Sorry.
- And yeah, the pendulum

18:35.848 --> 18:38.318
allows the clock
to stay regular.

18:38.351 --> 18:41.120
- "Pend-gelend-ulum"
- It's called a pendulum.

18:41.154 --> 18:43.089
- Yeah, penda, penda, yeah.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.192
- And as it goes
back and forth.

18:45.225 --> 18:48.828
That tick-tock, tick-tock.
That comes from this.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.130
- Tick-tock, and it don't stop.
- Please take that out.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.399
- And then this here.
- Here we go.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.966
- Look like a bag of headache.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.568
*

18:55.602 --> 19:00.072
- It's a host of levers.
I see everything in here

19:00.106 --> 19:02.108
like a complex puzzle piece.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.610
Levers.
- Give me love.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.445
- There's what
is called gear trains.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.946
- In a clock.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.781
How does this thing
keep such perfect time?

19:08.815 --> 19:10.183
You have the hour train,
the minute train,

19:10.217 --> 19:11.551
the second hand train.

19:11.584 --> 19:15.222
The gear trains would
work together in the clock,

19:15.255 --> 19:17.123
and the clock face
would be outside of it.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.558
These would be
sitting behind it.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.728
And then to change the clock,
I would need time,

19:21.761 --> 19:25.097
no pun intended, to put
this all together for you.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.799
But your chimes there,
take a look at these guys.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.068
Hand me one of those, please.
You can see now, varying--

19:29.101 --> 19:30.970
- That's a big one
right here, boy.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.171
- And this one.
- Look at that right here.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.306
- Yeah look at that.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.342
This has some
serious weight to it.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.644
Beautiful find, here you go.
- Thank you sir.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.679
Well, you know how
they say time is money?

19:39.712 --> 19:41.848
- Yeah, oh, it is.
- Can you break down my time,

19:41.881 --> 19:43.650
and see how much money
I can get on this here?

19:43.683 --> 19:45.985
- Yes, I can.
- That's all right.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.058
- $1,600.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.327
- You chimed a smile
on my face right now.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.563
I ain't even going to lie.
- Absolutely.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.631
You don't need to play it
like a flute, it's a chime.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.199
- Definitely,
I'm just celebrating.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.034
That's my sound of celebrating.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.873
announcer: Kenny Crossley
hit the big time,

20:06.906 --> 20:09.175
clocking in 2,300 bucks.

20:09.208 --> 20:14.481
Dave Hester's silver spoons
left him $2,100 richer.

20:14.514 --> 20:18.718
Justin Bryant sped away
with nearly 2,000 big ones.

20:18.751 --> 20:22.221
While Mary Padian
got side-swiped.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.391
- Here you go.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.259
- Spiders.
- Man, come on, bro.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.527
- Here, take your hands

20:27.560 --> 20:29.195
out there with it, go on.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.897
- Let's go, bruh.

20:30.930 --> 20:34.100
- Him scared of spiders.
- Here's another good set.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.802
Let Mary
touch it up a little bit.

20:35.835 --> 20:39.672
And there's another table top
maybe laying somewhere in here.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.441
What the , bro.
Come on, man.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.111
One's on the other side.
Oh, no!

20:45.144 --> 20:46.579
, bruh?
Come on, bruh.

20:46.613 --> 20:47.680
I'm serious, Carl.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.682
Putting the
spiders, bruh.

20:49.716 --> 20:50.983
Got his ass.
