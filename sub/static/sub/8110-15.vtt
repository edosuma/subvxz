WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:03.471
[alarm beeping]

00:03.504 --> 00:04.538
[clicks, stops]

00:06.074 --> 00:08.176
HOUSE?

00:12.146 --> 00:14.014
HOUSE?

00:19.320 --> 00:21.122
OH! MY GOD!

00:21.155 --> 00:22.323
WHAT THE HELL?

00:22.356 --> 00:23.324
[maniacal laugh]

00:23.357 --> 00:25.093
GOTCHA.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.294
DID YOU ACTUALLY
WAKE UP EARLY

00:26.327 --> 00:28.796
AND HIDE UNDER THE BED JUST
TO SCARE THE CRAP OUTTA ME?

00:28.829 --> 00:31.065
SET AN ALARM
AND EVERYTHING.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.767
IT'S LIKE DATING
A TEN-YEAR-OLD.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.537
GOD, I HOPE NOT.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.784
NOW THAT WE'RE DOWN HERE...

00:50.818 --> 00:53.121
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.122
SERIOUSLY?

00:54.155 --> 00:55.656
I HAVE TO PEE.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.360
I'LL WAIT.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.263
I BROUGHT A BOOK.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.566
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME
YOUR ALARM WAS SET FOR.

01:05.599 --> 01:06.634
HOUSE?

01:06.667 --> 01:09.237
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN RENT
THIS SPACE OUT DOWN HERE.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.239
IN JAPAN,
THAT WOULD BE LIKE A DELUXE--

01:11.272 --> 01:13.441
[door opens]
HOUSE, SHUT UP.

01:15.209 --> 01:18.146
THERE'S BLOOD IN MY URINE.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.258
YOU REALLY DON'T
HAVE TO BE HERE.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.893
YOU'RE MY GIRLFRIEND.
I'M BEING SUPPORTIVE.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.163
I'M MAINLY
TALKING ABOUT THEM.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.666
WELL, GIVEN THAT
THERE'S ALMOST CERTAINLY

01:38.699 --> 01:40.268
NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU,

01:40.301 --> 01:42.603
AND MY PATIENT DEFINITELY
HAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM--

01:42.636 --> 01:44.138
THAT CAN'T WAIT AN HOUR?

01:44.172 --> 01:45.139
'FRAID NOT.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.708
HE'S...

01:47.741 --> 01:49.277
CHASE.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.279
16-YEAR-OLD MALE
SPIT UP BLOOD

01:51.312 --> 01:52.813
DURING A PICK-UP
BASKETBALL GAME.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.615
E.R. COULDN'T FIND
THE SOURCE IN HIS LUNGS

01:54.648 --> 01:56.284
OR GI TRACT.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.785
SEE? SERIOUS.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.254
(Masters)
BRONCHIECTASIS,ITIS,

02:00.288 --> 02:02.356
INHALED PARTICLES.
WHAT ABOUT
ANGIODYSPLASIA?

02:02.390 --> 02:04.358
READY
WHEN YOU ARE...

02:04.392 --> 02:05.926
GET THEM OUTTA HERE.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.629
MY URETHRA IS NOT
FOR PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.165
BUT IT IS
A GOOD-TIME ADJACENT.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.166
FEED THE KID A CAMERA.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.902
CHECK HIS GOT FOR
ANGIODYSPLASIA.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.371
ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU COULD SCOOT DOWN.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.840
HEY, I'M, UH,
I'M MISSING A WATCH.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.909
SO CAN YOU KEEP
YOUR EYES OPEN WHILE--
OKAY!

02:21.942 --> 02:23.211
YOU TOO.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.948
THIS LITTLE CAMERA

02:27.981 --> 02:31.652
TRANSMITS IMAGES
TO THE DATA RECORDER

02:31.685 --> 02:32.886
SO WE CAN SEE

02:32.920 --> 02:35.856
IF YOU'VE GOT ANY
VASCULAR MALFORMATIONS

02:35.889 --> 02:37.325
IN YOUR GI TRACT.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.261
YOUR RECORDS SHOW
YOU'VE LOST SOME WEIGHT

02:40.294 --> 02:41.495
OVER THE PAST YEAR.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.331
WAS THAT INTENTIONAL?
NOT REALLY.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.598
WELL, HE'S BEEN

02:44.632 --> 02:46.667
EATING LESS
SINCE HE QUIT THE SWIM TEAM.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.869
YOU HAVE TO GET UP EARLY
FOR SWIM.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.571
IT WASN'T FUN ANYMORE.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.541
I NEED TO TALK TO YOUR SON
ABOUT SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.343
GENERALLY, IT'S LESS
EMBARRASSING FOR EVERYONE--

02:55.376 --> 02:57.711
WE'RE LEAVING.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.284
ACTUALLY, I'VE ONLY--

03:03.317 --> 03:06.320
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
CUTTING YOURSELF?

03:08.956 --> 03:11.992
THOSE ARE FROM A LAYBACK GRIND
THAT WENT WRONG.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.228
CAME OFF MY SKATEBOARD
STRAIGHT INTO A FENCE.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.796
SO...NO TO CUTTING

03:15.829 --> 03:18.499
BUT YES TO APPETITE
AND SLEEP CHANGES,

03:18.532 --> 03:22.002
AND YOU QUIT SOMETHING
YOU USED TO ENJOY.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.438
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN DEPRESSED?

03:26.507 --> 03:28.309
IMAGING SHOWED NO SIGN

03:28.342 --> 03:29.243
OF UPPER GI ISSUES.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.978
BUT THE KID DID ADMIT
TO BEING DEPRESSED

03:31.011 --> 03:34.014
AND TO SMOKING POT
TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.450
YOU ARE VERY PLEASED
WITH YOURSELF, AREN'T YOU?

03:36.484 --> 03:38.652
HIS MARIJUANA COULD BE LACED
WITH FORMALDEHYDE OR LEAD,

03:38.686 --> 03:40.254
WHICH COULD CAUSE
A PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE

03:40.288 --> 03:42.690
WHICH COULD MAKE HIM
SPIT UP BLOOD.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.793
YES. YES, I AM.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD CATCH.

03:47.995 --> 03:52.533
RUN A LEAD LEVEL
AND PUSH 5 LITERS IV FLUID.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.738
FEEL FREE TO TIP
YOUR OTHER SERVER.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.942
CYSTOSCOPY WAS CLEAN.

04:01.975 --> 04:05.346
CYTOPATHOLOGY WAS NORMAL.
WHY DO YOU HAVE
MY LAB RESULTS?

04:05.379 --> 04:06.614
I DON'T.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.582
IF I DID,
I'D KNOW YOU WERE FINE.

04:08.616 --> 04:11.319
UNLESS THE BLOOD
CAME FROM MY KIDNEYS.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.287
COME ON.
YOUR HYPOCHONDRIAC MOM

04:13.321 --> 04:15.889
HAD A BRUSH WITH MORTALITY
LAST MONTH,

04:15.923 --> 04:19.293
AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT
YOU'RE WORRYING MORE THAN USUAL,

04:19.327 --> 04:22.796
WORRYING THAT YOU MIGHT
TURN INTO HER.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.835
YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:29.537 --> 04:32.340
ODDS ARE,
THIS IS NOTHING.

04:32.373 --> 04:35.609
MEET ME IN THE CAFETERIA
IN TEN.

04:35.643 --> 04:38.446
THERE'LL BE A CORN DOG
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

04:38.479 --> 04:42.049
I MEAN AN ACTUAL CORN DOG.
THEY FIXED THE DEEP FRYER.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.429
I NEED TO SCHEDULE
AN ULTRASOUND.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.700
MY DAD'S HEAD'S
STILL IN ONE PIECE,

04:59.733 --> 05:02.069
SO I'M GUESSING YOU DIDN'T
MENTION THE POT.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.404
WHAT'D YOU TELL HIM?

05:03.437 --> 05:05.339
THE TRUTH.
YOU HAD A...

05:05.373 --> 05:06.640
MINOR CHEMICAL EXPOSURE,

05:06.674 --> 05:08.909
AND WE CAN'T BE 100% SURE
HOW IT HAPPENED.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.611
THANKS FOR COVERING.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.013
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE 16.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.715
YOU ALSO KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE DEPRESSED.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.518
YOU FIGURED OUT MY DEAL
AFTER ONLY A FEW MINUTES,

05:17.551 --> 05:20.087
BUT I BEEN FOOLING MY FRIENDS
AND PARENTS FOR MONTHS.

05:20.120 --> 05:23.391
IT'S MY JOB TO NOTICE THINGS.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.059
MAYBE TALKING TO YOUR PARENTS
WOULD MAKE THINGS BETTER.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.060
I'VE TRIED.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.763
THEY TAKE IT PERSONALLY
THAT I'M NOT HAPPY,

05:29.797 --> 05:33.434
AND THEN I END UP HAVING
TO MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.603
THEY DON'T GET ME.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.338
NO ONE DOES.

05:41.108 --> 05:44.412
IN MED SCHOOL,
IT SEEMED LIKE

05:44.445 --> 05:47.147
EVERYBODY ELSE
COULD HANDLE THE PRESSURE.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.518
I COULDN'T.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.388
I ENDED UP HURTING MYSELF.

05:54.422 --> 05:58.459
STUPIDEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

06:03.163 --> 06:06.133
YOU'VE GOT RED SPOTS
IN YOUR EYES.

06:06.166 --> 06:09.470
THEY WEREN'T THERE
BEFORE.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.044
YOU HAVE NICE SKIN.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.646
THANK YOU.
SHUT UP!

06:18.679 --> 06:21.482
SORRY. JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE RUDE NOT TO COMMENT.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.617
JUST TREAT ME LIKE
ANY OTHER PATIENT.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.853
RIGHT.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.122
ARE YOU SUCKING IN
YOUR STOMACH?

06:29.156 --> 06:30.424
NO.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.394
[straining]
HURRY UP BEFORE I PASS OUT.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.899
WILSON?

06:43.937 --> 06:45.172
ULTRASOUND ISN'T DEFINITIVE.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.840
WE SHOULD RUN OTHER
TESTS BEFORE--

06:46.874 --> 06:50.478
STOP TALKING LIKE A DOCTOR
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.146
THERE'S A MASS
IN YOUR KIDNEY.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.089
WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHY RYAN COUGHED BLOOD,

07:02.122 --> 07:04.625
AND NOW HE'S GOT SMALL
HEMORRHAGES IN HIS EYES.

07:04.658 --> 07:05.959
SOUNDS LIKE AN ACQUIRED
COAGULAPATHY

07:05.993 --> 07:08.195
WHICH GIVES US
A PRETTY WIDE DIFFERENTIAL.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.229
GETS A LOT NARROWER

07:09.262 --> 07:10.531
IF WE FACTOR IN
HIS DEPRESSION.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.632
OH, DON'T DO THAT!

07:11.665 --> 07:15.168
MOOD SWINGS CAN BE A SYMPTOM
OF PHYSIOLOGICAL ILLNESS.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.103
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.506
MOOD SWINGS ARE ALSO
A SYMPTOM OF ADOLESCENCE

07:18.539 --> 07:20.674
ALONG WITH EMO MUSIC
AND MASTURBATION.

07:20.708 --> 07:21.942
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
HIS WEIGHT LOSS

07:21.975 --> 07:23.477
AND SLEEPING ISSUES
STARTED A YEAR AGO.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.045
(Chase)
INFECTION MAKES THE MOST SENSE.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.180
HE SHOOTS HOOPS AT SCHOOL,
SHOWERS IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.550
I'M THINKING STAPH.
DAMN!

07:29.583 --> 07:30.784
YOU DON'T THINK--

07:30.818 --> 07:31.985
NOT TALKING TO YOU!

07:34.121 --> 07:36.757
EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH CUDDY?
SHE'S FINE.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.626
SHE'S JUST TOO STUPID
TO ACCEPT IT.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.094
START HIM ON NAFCILLIN
FOR STAPH.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.164
(Cuddy)
ALL THAT'S IN THE, UH,

07:44.197 --> 07:46.634
FIRST MUTUAL SAFETY
DEPOSIT BOX.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.835
THE RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS--

07:51.271 --> 07:53.140
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT
BECAUSE OF ONE ULTRASOUND

07:53.173 --> 07:56.076
PERFORMED BY AN INCOMPETENT
BONOBO MONKEY.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.745
AS DEMONSTRATED
BY MY SITTING HERE CALMLY

07:57.778 --> 07:58.812
GOING ABOUT MY BUSINESS.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.214
CALLING A LAWYER,
DRAFTING A WILL!

08:01.248 --> 08:02.683
OKAY. I-I...

08:02.716 --> 08:04.718
HACKED INTO YOUR
ONLINE SCHEDULE.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.820
LOOK, TESTS ALWAYS
SHOW SOMETHING.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.656
A MASS IN YOUR KIDNEY
COULD BE A COMPLEX CYST.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.658
IT COULD BE BENIGN.
I'M A SINGLE MOM.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.660
I NEED TO SET UP A TRUST,
APPOINT A GUARDIAN.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.628
IT'S SILLY THAT I HAVEN'T
DONE IT BEFORE NOW.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.630
BUT YOU'RE DOING IT NOW
BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU'RE SICK.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.765
THE FREAKING OUT
CAN AT LEAST WAIT

08:17.798 --> 08:19.600
UNTIL AFTER THE BIOPSY
THIS AFTERNOON.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.467
THE BIOPSY'S
NOT TILL TOMORROW.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.003
IT'S THE FIRST OPENING
IN THE SCHEDULE.

08:23.036 --> 08:23.871
FOR THE DEAN OF MEDICINE,

08:23.904 --> 08:26.006
THE FIRST OPENING
IN THE SCHEDULE IS...

08:26.039 --> 08:27.174
OH, LOOK! NOW.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.743
MY WORRY ISN'T ANY MORE
IMPORTANT THAN ANYONE ELSE'S.

08:29.777 --> 08:30.878
ACTUALLY, IT IS.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.846
BUT I'M NOT SICK, RIGHT?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.752
GOOD POINT.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.193
I WANT MY STUFF,
ASSHAT.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.595
I TOLD YOU, MAN,
I DON'T HAVE IT HERE.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.596
HEY...

08:48.629 --> 08:50.631
GUYS.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.232
EVERYTHING OKAY?

08:52.265 --> 08:53.667
ON MY WAY OUT.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.003
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.778
YOU WANNA...
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:10.984 --> 09:13.621
MY FRIEND GAVE ME SOME
LEFTOVER KLONOPIN HE HAD

09:13.654 --> 09:15.956
WHEN HE SWITCHED
HIS SEIZURE MEDS.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.658
I SOLD THEM TO ROID RAGE
FOR 80 BUCKS,

09:17.691 --> 09:19.693
BUT I LANDED IN HERE
BEFORE I COULD DELIVER,

09:19.727 --> 09:22.129
AND NOW HE'S GONNA
RIP MY ARMS OFF.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.764
HOW OFTEN
DO YOU SELL DRUGS?

09:23.797 --> 09:26.266
IT WAS A ONE-TIME THING.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.868
I NEEDED THE CASH,
I HAD THE PILLS,

09:27.901 --> 09:30.137
SO I THOUGHT, "WHY NOT?"

09:30.170 --> 09:31.905
IT WAS A BAD IDEA.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.108
THE PILLS ARE AT MY HOUSE.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.745
I COULD HAVE A FRIEND
GO GET THEM.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.789
GIVE THE THUG
HIS MONEY BACK.

09:50.658 --> 09:53.260
ONE TIME ONLY.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.932
I MEAN,
IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.701
YOU HAVE THREE KIDS
OF YOUR OWN.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.035
IT'S NOT EVEN A QUESTION.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.271
OF COURSE I'LL BE
RACHEL'S GUARDIAN.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.673
AND HOUSE
IS COOL WITH THIS?

10:05.706 --> 10:07.007
I MEAN, YOU GUYS...

10:07.040 --> 10:08.642
WE'VE ONLY BEEN TOGETHER
A FEW MONTHS.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.077
HMM. SEEMS LIKE
A LOT LONGER.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.680
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT HIM FOR TEN YEARS.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.314
AND BY TALKING,
I MEAN RANTING ABOUT

10:14.347 --> 10:15.849
WANTING
TO SMASH HIS TEETH IN

10:15.883 --> 10:18.719
WITH A STAPLER
FOR BEING SUCH A JERK.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.389
PEOPLE CHANGE.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.661
[knock at door]
I'LL GET IT.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.030
(House)
THAT BETTER BE HER!

10:30.063 --> 10:32.766
audience: OOH!

10:32.800 --> 10:36.704
RACHEL CUDDY, YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE HOME HALF AN HOUR AGO.

10:36.737 --> 10:37.905
DON'T BLAME ME--
HE'S THE ONE

10:37.938 --> 10:39.406
WHO WOULDN'T
RUN ANY RED LIGHTS.

10:39.439 --> 10:42.776
[laughter]

10:43.711 --> 10:44.912
MOUTH ON THAT KID

10:44.945 --> 10:48.816
MAKES MEL GIBSON SOUND LIKE
NELSON MANDELA.

10:48.849 --> 10:49.817
WHERE'D SHE LEARN THAT?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.152
[women whooping]

10:53.921 --> 10:55.222
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE,

10:55.255 --> 10:56.724
BUT I DIDN'T DO IT.

10:56.757 --> 10:57.891
[whooping, cheering]

10:57.925 --> 10:59.827
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
OFFICER?

10:59.860 --> 11:01.394
SHE WAS SHOPLIFTING
DOWN AT THE MALL.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.896
audience: AW!

11:02.930 --> 11:04.832
ARE EITHER OF YOU
THIS GIRL'S FATHER?

11:04.865 --> 11:06.700
NOPE. BUT SINCE
HER MOM DIED,

11:06.734 --> 11:08.702
SHE'S MY FAVORITE
TAX WRITE-OFF.

11:08.736 --> 11:11.772
OFFICER, YOU HAVE MY WORD
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.006
'CAUSE NEXT TIME...

11:13.040 --> 11:15.475
SHE WON'T GET CAUGHT!

11:15.508 --> 11:18.278
[laughter, applause]

11:22.916 --> 11:25.018
[loud cheering]

11:25.052 --> 11:26.987
[gasping, panting]

11:35.763 --> 11:38.866
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.734
GOOD FOR YOU.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.870
YOU COULD HAVE JUST
ASSUMED HE WAS A DRUG DEALER,

11:42.903 --> 11:44.504
BUT INSTEAD YOU
TOOK HIS WORD FOR IT.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.774
IT'S NICE TO FINALLY
SEE SOMEONE

11:46.807 --> 11:50.410
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH
IN HUMANITY AROUND HERE.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.946
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

11:54.982 --> 11:57.284
RYAN, YOU OKAY IN THERE?
I'M NOT SURE.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.890
I THINK I JUST PEED BLOOD.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.263
LOOKS LIKE PEEING BLOOD
IS THE NEW BLACK.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.799
PEEING BLOOD AFTER A NIGHT
ON ANTIBIOTICS

12:11.832 --> 12:14.034
MEANS WE CAN MOVE ON
FROM INFECTIONS.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.969
SCOPING SHOWED NO SIGN
OF A BLEED IN HIS BLADDER,

12:16.003 --> 12:18.371
WHICH POINTS
TO A KIDNEY PROBLEM.
PROBABLY SOME KINDA MASS.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.807
KIDNEY MASS WOULDN'T
EXPLAIN THE COUGHING BLOOD

12:19.840 --> 12:21.141
OR THE HEMORRHAGES.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.776
ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME,
ON THE OTHER HAND...

12:22.810 --> 12:25.378
MAKES SENSE.
BUT DOESN'T RULE OUT A MASS.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.980
(Masters)
YOU THINK IT'S CANCER?

12:27.014 --> 12:28.381
MASS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
CANCER.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.549
COULD BE
RENAL HEMATOMA.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.918
BUT THE PATIENT
DOESN'T HAVE

12:30.951 --> 12:33.286
ANY OTHER ABDOMINAL TRAUMA.
HE'S...

12:33.320 --> 12:34.922
NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE PATIENT.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.992
CUDDY HAS A MASS
ON HER KIDNEY?

12:39.026 --> 12:40.393
IT'S PROBABLY
JUST A COMPLEX CYST

12:40.427 --> 12:43.063
OR ANGIOMYOLIPOMA.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.131
IT'S A MASS, NOT A MYSTERY.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.434
THEY'LL DO THE BIOPSY,
THEN YOU'LL HAVE YOUR ANSWER.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.170
JUST...HAVE TO WAIT.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.439
PATIENT ADMITTED
TO USING POT.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.407
WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE
HE'S DOING.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.810
THIS COULD BE
A HEROIN-INDUCED NEPHROPATHY.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.378
I THOUGHT
YOU TRUSTED THIS KID.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.380
AND THEN YOU POINTED OUT
HOW SWEET THAT WAS.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.415
IF IT WERE HEROIN, HE'D BE
GOING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.384
ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME'S
A BETTER FIT.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.486
START THE PATIENT
ON PLASMAPHERESIS.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.420
WHILE HE'S DOING THAT,

13:07.454 --> 13:10.223
CAN I AT LEAST SEARCH
HIS HOUSE FOR DRUGS?

13:10.257 --> 13:12.192
HAVE I EVER SAID NO
TO THAT QUESTION?

13:16.096 --> 13:18.031
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:19.266 --> 13:20.367
PIE-EATING CONTEST.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.036
CUDDY'S BIOPSY
IS IN AN HOUR.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.537
YOU SHOULD BE
KEEPING HER COMPANY.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.943
OKAY. YOU'VE BEEN WORRIED
THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP

13:29.977 --> 13:31.311
IS GETTING IN THE WAY
OF YOUR DIAGNOSES,

13:31.344 --> 13:32.545
YOU'RE PROTECTING
YOUR PATIENT.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.415
EITHER THAT OR...
YOU'RE AN ASS.

13:35.448 --> 13:38.018
THREE--I HATE
THE SMELL OF DEATH.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.922
THE CHANCES OF CUDDY
HAVING RENAL CELL CARCINOMA--

13:41.955 --> 13:43.891
I'M TALKING ABOUT
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.392
SHE NEEDS SUPPORT
AND COMFORT,

13:45.425 --> 13:47.294
BOTH THINGS
THAT I FAMOUSLY SUCK AT.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.362
THIS WILL INEVITABLY
LEAD TO--

13:49.396 --> 13:52.232
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD
FOR THAT? PRACTICE.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.302
DOING IT--I DON'T KNOW--
ONCE?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.137
I'M NOT GONNA ACT LIKE
THERE'S A CRISIS

13:57.170 --> 13:58.138
BEFORE WE KNOW
THERE IS ONE.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.207
THERE'S NO PROOF
THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH HER.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.541
THERE'S NO PROOF
SHE'S BEING STALKED

14:01.574 --> 14:03.210
BY NINJA SQUIRRELS
EITHER,

14:03.243 --> 14:05.078
BUT IF SHE'S SCARED
OF THEM...

14:05.112 --> 14:07.380
AS HER BOYFRIEND,
IT'S YOUR JOB TO FIGURE OUT

14:07.414 --> 14:09.950
HOW TO HELP HER
FEEL BETTER.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.356
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.296
[footsteps approach]

14:25.065 --> 14:27.400
HOUSE TOLD ME
TO KEEP YOU COMPANY.

14:27.434 --> 14:30.237
NURSE TOLD ME TO GIVE YOU
ANTIBIOTICS.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.373
TELL HOUSE I'M FINE.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.443
MM!

14:39.479 --> 14:41.414
TOM CRUISE GOT MARRIED.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.183
[chuckles]

14:50.290 --> 14:52.625
DO YOU WANT ME TO QUOTE
FROM FIRST CORINTHIANS?

14:52.659 --> 14:55.395
'CAUSE I CAN DO THAT.
AS A JEW,

14:55.428 --> 14:57.130
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO DECLINE THAT OFFER.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.431
DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE MISSING.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.233
ST. PAUL
WAS REALLY ON HIS GAME.

15:05.338 --> 15:09.242
HE'LL SHOW UP EVENTUALLY.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.012
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
BELIEVE THAT.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.713
BUT I DO.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.248
ALL THESE YEARS,

15:15.282 --> 15:16.716
HE'S NEVER STOPPED
TRYING TO ANNOY ME

15:16.749 --> 15:19.286
FOR MORE THAN 15 MINUTES.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.355
AND NOW HE CAN'T EVEN
WALK INTO THE ROOM.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.460
LOVE HOPES ALL THINGS.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.266
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
AND THIS KID?

15:33.300 --> 15:35.535
HE'S DOGGY PADDLING
IN A SEA OF MISERY.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.603
I REMEMBER WHAT IT'S LIKE.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.671
HOW FAR DID YOU HAVE TO
REACH BACK FOR THAT MEMORY,

15:38.705 --> 15:40.440
LAST NIGHT?

15:40.473 --> 15:42.275
SOMETIMES I HEAR YOU
IN THE LIVING ROOM

15:42.309 --> 15:43.343
WATCHING TV
AT 3:00 A.M.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.279
THAT'S WHEN CLASSIC DR. WHO
COMES ON THE BBC.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.415
YEAH. IF ONLY THEY HAD
SOME DEVICE

15:48.448 --> 15:49.582
THAT ALLOWED YOU
TO RECORD THEM

15:49.616 --> 15:51.384
AND WATCH THEM
ANOTHER TIME.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.353
[cell phone rings]
I'M JUST SAYING...

15:53.386 --> 15:56.189
I DON'T THINK FIXING THIS KID
IS GONNA FIX YOU.

15:56.223 --> 15:58.992
YEP?

15:59.026 --> 16:01.028
WE'RE ON OUR WAY BACK.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.530
OUR PATIENT LOST ALL FEELING
IN HIS RIGHT ARM.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.498
LOOK AT THIS.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.490
[beep beep beep]

16:31.658 --> 16:33.460
[current crackles]

16:33.493 --> 16:36.763
CHASE?

16:36.796 --> 16:39.632
HOW'D IT GO WITH CUDDY?

16:41.601 --> 16:42.569
CHASE?

16:42.602 --> 16:44.737
[current crackling]

16:52.445 --> 16:55.182
[screeching]

16:59.119 --> 17:00.520
AAH!

17:22.375 --> 17:25.044
GOOD THING
I BROUGHT MY AX CANE.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.182
(Cuddy)
HOUSE...HELP ME!

17:29.216 --> 17:31.418
I'M COMING!

17:34.587 --> 17:36.556
HOUSE...PLEASE!

17:39.892 --> 17:41.594
IT LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT COMPANY.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.585
AAH...AAH!

18:05.618 --> 18:08.588
[suspenseful music]

18:08.621 --> 18:11.491
*

18:11.524 --> 18:13.593
(Cuddy)
AAH...AAH!

18:20.600 --> 18:21.734
[hisses]

18:21.768 --> 18:22.902
NO!

18:22.935 --> 18:24.204
AH...

18:25.505 --> 18:28.141
ARE YOU OKAY?

18:29.876 --> 18:31.244
I WAS SLEEPING.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.346
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

18:39.786 --> 18:40.787
(Masters)
PATIENT LOST FEELING IN HIS ARM

18:40.820 --> 18:42.822
WHILE ON STEROIDS--
RULES OUT AUTOIMMUNE.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.691
SO WHAT CAUSES BLEEDING,
KIDNEY PROBLEMS,

18:44.724 --> 18:46.259
AND UNILATERAL NUMBNESS?

18:46.293 --> 18:48.261
AND A COMPLETE ABSENCE
OF ANY RECORD

18:48.295 --> 18:50.330
OF CUDDY'S KIDNEY BIOPSY.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.265
SHE MUST HAVE PUT IT
UNDER A FALSE NAME

18:52.299 --> 18:55.435
SO I COULDN'T
RUSH THE RESULTS.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.670
WHAT IF WE HAD IT BACKWARDS

18:57.704 --> 18:59.639
AND IT'S NOT A BLEEDING PROBLEM,
IT'S A CLOTTING PROBLEM?

18:59.672 --> 19:02.175
THERE'S NO PATIENT FILE
CREATED IN THE LAST TWO DAYS

19:02.209 --> 19:04.377
FOR ANYONE HAVING
THAT PROCEDURE.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.545
SHE BACKDATED THE FILE?

19:05.578 --> 19:06.946
THAT'S VERY CLEVER.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.182
HANDS OFF.
SHE'S MINE.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.283
CLOTS COULD EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING

19:10.317 --> 19:11.518
INCLUDING THE NUMBNESS.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.286
WE SHOULD DO AN ANGIOGRAM
OF HIS BRAIN,

19:13.320 --> 19:15.422
SEE IF WE CAN FIND IT.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.493
HOUSE.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.728
WE'RE WORRIED TOO.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.331
HOW SWEET.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.732
I'M NOT WORRIED.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.934
I JUST WANNA GET THE RESULTS
SO SHE CAN STOP WORRYING.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.902
OKAY,
BUT IN THE MEANTIME--
DO AN ANGIOGRAM.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.839
YOU TWO GO TO PATHOLOGY
AND LOOK AT CUDDY'S SLIDES.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.874
YOU JUST SAID YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHICH SAMPLE WAS HERS.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.643
I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM ALL.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.882
(Chase)
BIGGER QUESTION--
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH TAUB?

19:42.915 --> 19:45.285
JUST BECAUSE HOUSE
IS TOO DISTRACTED

19:45.318 --> 19:47.354
TO NOTICE YOUR DISTRACTION
DOESN'T MEAN WE DIDN'T.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.456
CLOTS, ANGIOGRAMS--
I'M FOCUSED.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.991
THE KID SCRATCHED OUT
THE FACES OF HALF HIS CLASS.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.526
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT'S A PROBLEM?

19:53.560 --> 19:54.761
(Foreman)
IT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM.

19:54.794 --> 19:55.895
WHY IS IT ANYONE'S PROBLEM?

19:55.928 --> 19:58.465
I VIOLENTLY EXECUTED
MY TENTH GRADE GEOMETRY TEACHER

19:58.498 --> 20:00.433
ABOUT FIVE DIFFERENT WAYS
IN MY MIND.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.501
I DIDN'T WANT
TO KILL ANYBODY.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.704
I JUST WANTED TO TORTURE
THEM SLOWLY IN MY BASEMENT,

20:04.737 --> 20:06.273
PREFERABLY WITH ACID.

20:07.940 --> 20:11.478
YOU GUYS EVER THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU MIGHT TO DO HOUSE?

20:11.511 --> 20:13.513
[elevator bell dings]

20:18.318 --> 20:20.487
MAYBE IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.888
UNLESS IT IS.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.591
SOMEONE SHOT HOUSE.

20:26.058 --> 20:32.265
[television chatter]

20:34.334 --> 20:35.802
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:35.835 --> 20:37.704
PIE-EATING CONTEST.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.540
I WAS GOING TO SEND CHASE

20:40.573 --> 20:43.042
TO TELL YOU WHAT THE OBVIOUS
RIGHT THING TO DO HERE IS,

20:43.075 --> 20:44.544
BUT THEN I REALIZED...

20:44.577 --> 20:47.013
IF YOU WERE TOO STUPID
TO KNOW HOW STUPID THAT WAS,

20:47.046 --> 20:48.848
YOU MIGHT MISS THE IRONY.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.817
YOU HAVE TO BE
WITH HER.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.819
YEAH. I GET IT.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.287
SHE NEEDS ARTIFICIAL
SUPPORT

20:54.321 --> 20:55.822
FOR AN ARTIFICIAL PROBLEM.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.958
SHE'S FINE.
CHASE DID AN EXCELLENT JOB.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.993
SHE DOESN'T SLEEP
WITH CHASE.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.495
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

21:02.529 --> 21:03.696
HEY!

21:03.730 --> 21:05.832
EATING PIE IN HERE.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.867
HOUSE...

21:07.900 --> 21:09.902
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU
A THIRD TIME.

21:09.936 --> 21:10.903
DO NOT SCREW THIS UP.

21:10.937 --> 21:14.607
BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T
WANNA CLEAN UP THE MESS.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.910
HE'S REFERRING TO THE PIE.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.812
14 PATIENTS
WITH KIDNEY BIOPSIES.

21:19.846 --> 21:23.750
I TABULATED THEM AGAINST
THEIR URINALYSIS RESULTS.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.585
SIX MEN, THREE DIABETICS,

21:25.618 --> 21:27.587
ONE LCDD, ONE KID,
TWO SENIORS,

21:27.620 --> 21:31.424
AND BY DEFAULT,
ONE...CUDDY.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.695
UH...THE BIOPSY
WAS INCONCLUSIVE.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.730
THE MASS IS NEAR
THE CENTER OF HER KIDNEY.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.099
THEY COULDN'T GET
A READABLE SAMPLE.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.369
MEANS THEY'LL HAVE TO
REMOVE THE MASS

21:42.402 --> 21:44.437
TO KNOW IF IT'S CANCER
OR NOT.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.805
THE FILE SAYS

21:45.838 --> 21:46.973
THEY'RE DOING
SOME IMAGING NOW,

21:47.006 --> 21:50.309
GIVE THE SURGEON A BETTER
IDEA OF WHAT HE'S DEALING WITH.

21:54.381 --> 21:55.448
[door closes]

21:55.482 --> 21:57.083

CAN WE ORDER PIZZA?

21:59.051 --> 22:01.421
THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE FRIDGE.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.122
AT LEAST NOT ANYMORE.

22:03.155 --> 22:06.393
WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH THE PATIENT?

22:06.426 --> 22:07.660
ANGIO SHOWED A CLOT

22:07.694 --> 22:09.662
IN A BRANCH OF HIS
MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY.

22:09.696 --> 22:12.899
STARTED HIM ON STREPTOKINASE
TO BREAK IT UP.

22:12.932 --> 22:16.436
ALTHOUGH...MAYBE WE SHOULD
HAVE JUST PLAYED A FEW ROUNDS

22:16.469 --> 22:19.038
OF SAVAGESCAPE 2: THE REVENGE,
BECAUSE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

22:19.071 --> 22:20.973
THE BEST WAY TO MAKE SOMEONE
FEEL BETTER.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.043
YOU KEEP TALKING LIKE WILSON,
YOUR FACE WILL FREEZE LIKE THAT.

22:24.076 --> 22:27.079
LOOK, HOWEVER BAD YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE IN THAT ROOM,

22:27.113 --> 22:30.049
NOT BEING IN THE ROOM
IS WORSE.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.923
WHEN SHE BREAKS UP
WITH YOU...

22:36.956 --> 22:39.125
YOU'RE PLAYING BY YOURSELF.

22:39.158 --> 22:42.361
[firing sounds]

22:43.530 --> 22:45.031
HONEY, I'M HOME.

22:45.064 --> 22:48.134
JUST IN TIME.
POT ROAST IS READY.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.036
SMELLS WONDERFUL!

22:50.069 --> 22:51.638
I CURED ALL MY PATIENTS,

22:51.671 --> 22:53.840
SO I CAME HOME TO SPEND
TIME WITH RACHEL.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.042
AND HOW WAS YOUR DAY
TODAY?

22:56.075 --> 22:57.076
IT WAS GREAT, MA!

22:57.109 --> 22:59.412
I GOT 100%
ON MY SPELLING TEST

22:59.446 --> 23:01.748
AND 170 ON MY LSATS!

23:01.781 --> 23:04.584
YOUR LSATS?
YOU'RE EIGHT YEARS OLD.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.118
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING
TOGETHER.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.955
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A SURPRISE.

23:08.988 --> 23:12.091
WELL, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

23:12.124 --> 23:13.460
I THINK RACHEL

23:13.493 --> 23:14.827
DESERVES A TREAT.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.095
NO, THANKS, DADDY.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.130
IT MIGHT SPOIL MY APPETITE.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.466
[knock at door]

23:19.499 --> 23:21.701
WELL, WHO COULD THAT BE?

23:24.136 --> 23:26.172
DELIVERY FOR YOU,
MRS. HOUSE.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.575
HAPPY 29TH BIRTHDAY.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.143
I'M NOT 29!

23:32.812 --> 23:35.047
YOU'RE NOT LIMPING.

23:36.783 --> 23:39.185
THIS ISN'T POSSIBLE.

23:39.218 --> 23:42.922
NONE OF THIS IS POSSIBLE.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.525
GIRL CAN DREAM.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.960
[knock at door]
[gasps]

23:47.994 --> 23:50.162
[knocking]

23:52.031 --> 23:53.800
[knocking continues]

23:55.968 --> 23:58.204
YOU RUN OUT OF SUGAR?

23:59.772 --> 24:03.209
GOT YOUR SCANS BACK
FROM TODAY.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.158
[cell phone rings]

24:19.191 --> 24:21.227
YEAH.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.730
[firing sounds]

24:23.763 --> 24:25.532
[firing stops]

24:29.235 --> 24:31.037
OKAY.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.042
WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:39.111 --> 24:41.147
IMAGING SHOWS ENHANCING MASSES

24:41.180 --> 24:44.150
ACROSS MULTIPLE LOBES
OF CUDDY'S LUNGS.

24:44.183 --> 24:47.086
[controller clatters]

24:47.119 --> 24:50.356
THAT'S WHAT KIDNEY CANCER
LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT METASTASIZES.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.596
SHE'S DEAD.

25:02.301 --> 25:03.770
WHAT'S UP, LOSERS?

25:03.803 --> 25:05.905
I HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING
BEING ALIVE.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.074
TODAY'S LESSON:
NATURAL SELECTION.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.777
EXCELLENT SYSTEM.
MADE US WHO WE ARE TODAY.

25:10.810 --> 25:13.045
BUT THEN WE INVENTED SEAT BELTS
AND GROCERY STORES,

25:13.079 --> 25:15.748
THINGS THAT KEEP IDIOTS
AND WEAKLINGS ALIVE.

25:15.782 --> 25:17.750
AND LET'S BE HONEST.

25:17.784 --> 25:19.786
MOST OF YOU
DON'T REALLY DESERVE IT.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.757
HERE'S TO THE NATURAL ORDER.

25:28.895 --> 25:29.896
[boom]

25:31.898 --> 25:32.865
YES!

25:32.899 --> 25:36.068
[laughs]
WHOO!

25:36.102 --> 25:37.904
COPIED
FROM HIS FLASH DRIVE.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.106
DO I GO TO THE COPS?

25:40.139 --> 25:42.642
YES. "OFFICER, I'D LIKE
TO REPORT AN ASSAULT.

25:42.675 --> 25:45.244
THE VICTIM
WAS A PILE OF LEAVES."

25:45.277 --> 25:46.679
IT GOES ON.

25:46.713 --> 25:47.914
HE TALKS ABOUT
BOMBING HIS SCHOOL.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.816
WHICH YOU KNOW BECAUSE
YOU STOLE HIS FLASH DRIVE

25:49.849 --> 25:51.684
AND BROKE INTO HIS HOUSE.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.185
HOW'S THAT GONNA PLAY?

25:53.219 --> 25:55.655
(Masters)
RYAN'S NOT RESPONDING
TO STREPTOKINASE.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.690
WE DON'T HAVE VERY LONG
BEFORE THE DAMAGE

25:57.724 --> 25:59.025
BECOMES IRREVERSIBLE.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.326
SO WE EITHER UP HIS DOSAGE

26:00.359 --> 26:02.361
OR GO INTO HIS HEAD
AND GET THE CLOT OUT.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.030
WHERE'S HOUSE?
HOPEFULLY WITH CUDDY.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.265
SHE DID JUST GET
SOME PRETTY AWFUL NEWS.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.667
I CALLED HER.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.836
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS EITHER.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.776
HAVE YOU SEEN HOUSE?

26:16.809 --> 26:18.244
NO.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.015
HE LEFT MY PLACE
LAST NIGHT AFTER YOU CALLED.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.717
NO ONE'S SEEN HIM TODAY.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.686
ANY IDEA WHERE HE'D BE?

26:26.719 --> 26:28.855
NO.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.258
AND YOU'RE NOT...
WORRIED ABOUT THAT?

26:32.291 --> 26:34.761
HE'S NOT GOOD
WITH BAD NEWS.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.763
YES. I'M WORRIED.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.698
BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT HOUSE.
IT'S ABOUT CUDDY.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.099
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO COULD BE DYING,

26:40.132 --> 26:41.801
AND HE'S TRYING TO
MAKE THIS ABOUT HIMSELF.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.703
I'M NOT PLAYING.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.705
OKAY...

26:48.007 --> 26:50.810
SHE STILL BELIEVES
HE'LL SHOW UP.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.680
HE'LL EITHER GET OVER HIMSELF

26:53.713 --> 26:56.716
AND BE WHO SHE NEEDS HIM TO BE

26:56.749 --> 27:00.152
OR HE WON'T.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.788
[keys clacking]

27:01.821 --> 27:02.989
(Taub)
WE'D LIKE TO DO AN EMBOLECTOMY.

27:03.022 --> 27:06.058
WE'LL RUN A CORKSCREW-SHAPED
INSTRUMENT INTO RYAN'S BRAIN

27:06.092 --> 27:09.829
AND PULL THE CLOT OUT.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.030
OKAY.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.398
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO HIM ABOUT IT?

27:12.431 --> 27:15.902
YES. BUT I WANTED
TO SEE YOU ALONE.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.838
I SAW SOME VIDES THAT RYAN
MADE A FEW WEEKS AGO.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.973
HE'S BLOWING UP PIPE BOMBS

27:21.007 --> 27:23.075
AND THREATENING PEOPLE
IN HIS SCHOOL.

27:23.109 --> 27:23.910
(Kay)
OH, GOD!

27:23.943 --> 27:25.377
HE WAS PROBABLY
JUST MESSING AROUND.

27:25.411 --> 27:26.713
OUR SON WOULDN'T
HURT ANYBODY.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.280
I'M NOT SO SURE.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.882
I KNOW THIS LOOKS BAD,

27:29.916 --> 27:31.818
BUT RYAN'S A GOOD KID.

27:31.851 --> 27:34.821
HE'S HAD A ROUGH COUPLE YEARS
SINCE HE STARTED HIGH SCHOOL,

27:34.854 --> 27:36.155
BUT I REALLY THINK
HE'LL COME OUT OF IT.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.924
HE NEEDS HELP.
MAYBE HE DOES,

27:37.957 --> 27:39.959
BUT IF THIS GETS OUT,
HE'LL BE SUSPENDED,

27:39.992 --> 27:41.828
MAYBE EXPELLED.

27:41.861 --> 27:44.263
HOW ABOUT YOU FOCUS
ON KEEPING HIM ALIVE?

27:44.296 --> 27:46.298
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

27:46.332 --> 27:48.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO?

27:48.034 --> 27:49.135
PSSH. HA.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.402
SO YOU CAN DO
THE OPPOSITE?

27:50.436 --> 27:52.839
THERE ARE KIDS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

27:52.872 --> 27:55.041
DOING DUMB,
POTENTIALLY VIOLENT THINGS,

27:55.074 --> 27:58.110
BUT THE PERCENTAGE OF THEM
WHO WOULD ACTUALLY KILL ANYBODY

27:58.144 --> 27:59.411
IS MINISCULE.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.080
SO I SHOULDN'T DO
ANYTHING.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.082
MM...WHILE THE ODDS
ARE LOW,

28:03.115 --> 28:05.885
THE FALLOUT COULD BE...
HUGE.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.920
TENS OR EVEN HUNDREDS
OF LIVES.

28:07.954 --> 28:10.022
SO I SHOULD CALL
THE COPS.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.024
OF COURSE, OVER-IDENTIFICATION
WITH THE SUBJECT

28:12.058 --> 28:15.795
COULD SKEW THE CALCULATION
TOWARDS BEING EXTRA-PROTECTIVE.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.730
OR ALTERNATIVELY--

28:17.764 --> 28:20.166
YOU SUCK AT THIS.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.337
HATE THE STATISTICS...

28:25.371 --> 28:27.306
NOT THE STATISTICIAN.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.946
GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE DYE.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.150
(Chase)
THERE'S THE CLOT.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.858
IT JUST DISINTEGRATED
WHEN YOU TOUCHED IT.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.861
WHAT WAS THAT THING?

29:01.874 --> 29:03.843
I GOT A GREAT IDEA
WHERE WE SHOULD GO.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.144
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.446
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.115
AUSTRALIA'S FINEST.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.818
THERE'S A GREAT KARAOKE
BAR IN NEWARK--

29:11.851 --> 29:13.252
I HATE KARAOKE.

29:13.285 --> 29:16.956
THEY GOT EVERY--
EVERY SONG

29:16.989 --> 29:19.091
BY EVERY AUSSIE ARTIST.

29:19.125 --> 29:23.029
MIDNIGHT OIL, MEN AT WORK,
OLIVIA NEWTON JOHN.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.231
I DO A MEAN VERSION
OF PHYSICAL.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.000
AND THE BARBECUE SHRIMP
IS AMAZING.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.038
WHAT ABOUT THE FRIES?

29:32.071 --> 29:35.074
HOT AND SALTY
AND DELICIOUS.

29:35.107 --> 29:38.077
[paper rustling]

29:43.983 --> 29:46.085
TALKING ABOUT FOOD
MADE ME HUNGRY.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.456
YOU HAD CANDY
IN MY OTHER DREAMS.

29:50.489 --> 29:53.059
MEANS YOU'RE STRESSED
AT WORK.

29:53.092 --> 29:55.561
ALL DREAM SYMBOLS
MEAN YOU'RE STRESSED AT WORK.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.429
OR CASTRATION ANXIETY.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.065
NO.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.968
I WAS HOPING...

30:02.001 --> 30:05.104
YOU'D FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO HANDLE ALL THIS.

30:07.106 --> 30:11.077
MAYBE YOU CAN'T BECAUSE
YOU'RE STILL A CHILD.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.880
I CAN DO BETTER.

30:20.186 --> 30:22.454
MIGHT BE TOO LATE.

30:29.628 --> 30:30.963
HOUSE!

30:30.997 --> 30:32.431
[loud gunfire]

30:32.464 --> 30:33.499
[gasps]

30:33.532 --> 30:35.067
AH...

30:59.025 --> 31:01.360
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.998
SORRY.

31:10.636 --> 31:13.039
I KNEW YOU'D COME.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.381
WHAT WAS THAT THING,

31:22.414 --> 31:24.516
AND WHY DID IT JUST DISSOLVE

31:24.550 --> 31:25.952
IN THE MIDDLE OF SURGERY?

31:25.985 --> 31:27.286
(Foreman)
WHY IS HIS LIVER SHUTTING DOWN?

31:27.319 --> 31:28.220
THAT THING
IN HIS BRAIN GOES AWAY,

31:28.254 --> 31:29.521
THE KID SLIPS INTO A COMA.

31:29.555 --> 31:30.990
(Masters)
WE STARTED HIM
ON LACTULOSE,

31:31.023 --> 31:33.159
BUT AT THE RATE
HIS LIVER FUNCTION IS DECLINING,

31:33.192 --> 31:34.393
HE'LL BE DEAD IN A DAY.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.695
SHOULD WE PAGE HOUSE?

31:36.728 --> 31:38.330
(Chase)
HE'S BUSY.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.236
(Masters)
HOUSE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
FOR HER NOW.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.305
WE NEED HIM!
BY HIS OWN LOGIC--

31:46.338 --> 31:48.240
(Chase)
PATIENT'S BLOOD TESTS
WERE NEGATIVE

31:48.274 --> 31:50.542
FOR BARBITURATES
OR ACETAMINOPHEN.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.378
HE'S NOT ON
A HIGH PROTEIN DIET.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.580
HOUSE COULDN'T CONCENTRATE ON
THE CASE BEFORE SHE WAS DYING.

31:54.613 --> 31:57.349
YOU THINK HE'S GONNA
GET IN THE GAME NOW?

31:58.484 --> 32:00.252
IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT,

32:00.286 --> 32:02.188
I WON'T SLEEP WITH ANYONE
FOR AT LEAST A MONTH.

32:02.221 --> 32:03.555
MAKE IT TWO.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.491
BITCH.

32:08.327 --> 32:11.230
(Masters)
A.I.P. CAN CAUSE UREMIA,
TANK THE LIVER.

32:11.263 --> 32:14.033
(Chase)
IT CAUSES ABDOMINAL CRAMPING,
NOT ABDOMINAL BLEEDING.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.335
(Masters)
OH, BECAUSE FUCOSIDOSIS
WAS SUCH A BRILLIANT IDEA?

32:16.368 --> 32:18.537
(Taub)
GUYS!

32:20.306 --> 32:22.674
(Chase)
TYPE 2 CITRULLINEMIA FITS.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.111
(Masters)
THERE ARE NO SIGNS
OF HYPERLIPIDEMIA

32:25.144 --> 32:27.646
OR PANCREATITIS.
(Taub)
THOSE CAN TAKE YEARS TO EMERGE.

32:27.679 --> 32:28.714
CLOSEST WE'VE GOTTEN.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.216
START HIM ON IV
SODIUM BENZOATE

32:30.249 --> 32:32.418
TO REDUCE THE AMMONIA
LEVELS IN HIS BLOOD.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.421
RUN A GENETIC TEST
FOR CITRULLINEMIA.

HI.

35:54.453 --> 35:57.489
GUESS WHO DOESN'T
HAVE CANCER?

35:57.523 --> 35:59.425
ME.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.593
ALSO YOU.

36:01.627 --> 36:02.861
ACTUALLY, YOU FOR SURE.
ME...

36:04.763 --> 36:06.865
YOUR TUMOR WAS BENIGN.

36:06.898 --> 36:09.368
AN ONCOCYTOMA.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.437
THEY CUT IT OUT.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.674
THEN WHAT WAS
IN MY LUNGS?

36:15.707 --> 36:17.809
ONCE THEY RULED OUT
CANCER,

36:17.843 --> 36:20.746
I REMEMBERED THAT YOUR MOM
WAS ALLERGIC TO ANTIBIOTICS.

36:20.779 --> 36:22.414
SO I HAD THEM TEST
YOUR BLOOD,

36:22.448 --> 36:24.316
AND YOUR IgE LEVELS
WERE THROUGH THE ROOF.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.952
BECAUSE THE LUNG MASSES
WERE AN ALLERGIC REACTION.

36:26.985 --> 36:29.221
SO NOW YOU'RE OFF
THE ANTIBIOTICS,

36:29.255 --> 36:31.457
YOUR LUNGS
SHOULD CLEAR RIGHT UP.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.663
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.599
SAY HELLO TO YOUR TUMOR.

36:40.632 --> 36:41.600
UGH!

36:41.633 --> 36:43.269
WAIT.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.582
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
THAT I COULD BE AFRAID OF,

36:56.615 --> 36:59.251
AND MOST OF THE TIME,
I MANAGE TO...

36:59.285 --> 37:02.254
LOCK THEM UP BEHIND DOORS.

37:02.288 --> 37:05.824
BUT THIS HAPPENS...

37:05.857 --> 37:08.727
ALL THOSE DOORS
JUST BURST OPEN.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.939
YOU JUST FIGURED SOMETHING OUT
ABOUT YOUR PATIENT, DIDN'T YOU?

37:22.908 --> 37:24.843
GO. DO WHAT YOU DO.

37:29.715 --> 37:32.050
TAKE HIM OFF THE MEDS.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.386
HE'S GOT A STAPH INFECTION.

37:34.420 --> 37:35.787
YOU TREATED HIM FOR
STAPH THREE DAYS AGO.

37:35.821 --> 37:36.955
IT DIDN'T WORK.

37:36.988 --> 37:38.990

MORE JUST KEEP COMING.

OH! HE'S TALKING ABOUT
AN ABSCESS.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.732
I GOT THAT.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.534
FOR THE CHEAP SEATS,

37:48.567 --> 37:50.802
AN ABSCESS
IS A GOOEY LITTLE CREAM PUFF

LITTLE PRIDE AND HOMICIDAL JOY

37:59.010 --> 38:00.612
IF WE CAN FIND THE DOOR.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.884

WHERE IT IS.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.762
IF HE GOT HIT BY SHRAPNEL,

38:16.795 --> 38:18.730
THE BODY WALLS OFF
THE FOREIGN OBJECT,

38:18.764 --> 38:20.499
WHICH, BECAUSE IT'S PLASTIC,

38:20.532 --> 38:22.000
DOESN'T SHOW UP ON IMAGING

38:22.033 --> 38:23.835
AND PROVIDES A PERFECT HOME
FOR BACTERIA.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.737
ANTIBIOTICS
ATTACKED THE INFECTION,

38:25.771 --> 38:27.439
CAUSING PIECES TO BREAK OFF.

38:27.473 --> 38:28.674
SOME HIT THE LIVER.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.442
ONE LODGED IN HIS BRAIN
AND DISSOLVED

38:30.476 --> 38:31.777
WHEN FOREMAN TOUCHED IT.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.912
ONCE WE DRAIN THE ABSCESS
AND REMOVE THE SHRAPNEL,

38:33.945 --> 38:36.448
THE ANTIBIOTICS
CAN DO THEIR JOB.

38:36.482 --> 38:37.949
HE'LL BE FINE.

38:39.685 --> 38:43.489
WHICH JUST LEAVES...
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

38:46.492 --> 38:47.659
ALL RIGHT.

38:47.693 --> 38:50.396
I PUT THE REST OF THE SOUP
IN THE FREEZER

38:50.429 --> 38:52.598
SO YOU'LL HAVE SOME
FOR LATER.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.934
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
YEAH.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.869
HERE YOU GO.
I GOT IT.

38:57.903 --> 38:59.805
OKAY.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.741
ARE YOU GONNA
TELL MOM?

39:02.774 --> 39:04.976
SO SHE CAN SHOW UP HERE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU

39:05.010 --> 39:09.047
BY HARASSING THE HOUSEKEEPER
AND CRITICIZING YOUR BATHROBE?

39:09.080 --> 39:11.983
YEAH. I THINK I'M GONNA
WAIT A FEW YEARS.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.789
OH, AND I MOVED
YOUR SLEEPING PILLS

BACK IN THE MEDICINE CABINET
BECAUSE I JUST WORRY.

39:39.545 --> 39:42.147
WHEN YOU CAME
TO MY HOSPITAL ROOM THAT NIGHT,

39:42.180 --> 39:45.083
YOU WERE STONED.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.563
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

40:00.866 --> 40:03.535
HOW DID I NOT KNOW?

40:03.569 --> 40:05.571
HOW DID I MAKE MYSELF
FORGET FOR MONTHS

40:05.604 --> 40:07.573
THAT YOU'RE AN ADDICT?

40:09.575 --> 40:11.710
MY SUBCONSCIOUS
WAS TRYING TO TELL ME

40:11.743 --> 40:14.513
YOU COULD NEVER GET
THROUGH THIS WITHOUT DRUGS.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.885
IT WAS A ONE-TIME THING.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.887
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE PILLS, HOUSE.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.855
IT'S ABOUT WHAT THEY MEAN.

40:23.889 --> 40:25.924
I WAS SCARED
BECAUSE I THOUGHT

40:25.957 --> 40:27.926
MY GIRLFRIEND MIGHT DIE.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.628
NO.

40:29.661 --> 40:32.498
YOU DON'T TAKE VICODIN
BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.132
YOU TAKE IT
SO YOU WON'T FEEL PAIN.

40:34.165 --> 40:36.835
EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER DONE
IS TO AVOID PAIN--

40:36.868 --> 40:38.036
DRUGS, SARCASM...

40:38.069 --> 40:40.171
KEEPING EVERYBODY
AT ARM'S LENGTH

40:40.205 --> 40:41.907
SO NO ONE CAN HURT YOU.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.675
AS OPPOSED TO EVERYONE ELSE
IN THE WORLD

40:43.709 --> 40:46.778
WHO GOES LOOKING FOR PAIN
LIKE IT'S BURIED TREASURE?

40:48.680 --> 40:52.684
PAIN HAPPENS WHEN YOU CARE.

40:52.718 --> 40:54.219
Y-YOU CAN'T LOVE SOMEONE

40:54.252 --> 40:58.857
WITHOUT MAKING YOURSELF OPEN
TO THEIR PROBLEMS,

40:58.890 --> 41:01.660
THEIR FEARS.

41:01.693 --> 41:03.862
AND YOU'RE NOT WILLING
TO DO THAT.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.864
I CA--I CAME
TO BE WITH YOU.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.867
BUT YOU WEREN'T WITH ME,
NOT REALLY.

41:10.702 --> 41:13.839
I WANTED TO BE.

41:15.907 --> 41:17.943
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

41:22.981 --> 41:26.484
I CAN DO BETTER.

41:29.788 --> 41:32.791
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN.

41:37.095 --> 41:39.164
YOU'LL CHOOSE YOURSELF
OVER EVERYBODY ELSE

41:39.197 --> 41:40.832
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

41:40.866 --> 41:42.801
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
WHO YOU ARE.

DON'T.

41:54.713 --> 41:56.782
DON'T.
I THOUGHT I COULD DO THIS.
