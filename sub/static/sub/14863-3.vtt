I have to pick up my daughter.

00:10.872 --> 00:12.040
He's never calling again.

00:12.065 --> 00:13.678
He also said he was going out of town.

00:13.678 --> 00:15.145
Yeah, he's never calling again.

I'm the one who turned you in, Karen.

sitting here supporting you.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.550
Jacob, I'm so sorry!

00:20.584 --> 00:23.453
I choose you, Savi. You're my love.

00:23.487 --> 00:25.488
You feel so right to me.

00:27.590 --> 00:30.288
I prefer you sell this
house as quickly as possible

- for as much money as you can.

actually feeling the wood?

01:11.902 --> 01:14.036
I mean, seriously. Who feels wood?

01:14.071 --> 01:15.404
People who come to an open house.

01:16.238 --> 01:17.239
I guess. It's just...

It's so weird having everyone
touch my things, you know?

01:20.609 --> 01:24.102
And be so judgmental of my home.

01:24.188 --> 01:27.023
Maybe so, but on the plus
side, it went really well.

01:27.148 --> 01:28.348
I'd be surprised if we didn't

02:13.065 --> 02:15.366
You should let Harry know
this could be happening soon.

02:15.487 --> 02:17.522
Mm, that might be kind of difficult,

02:17.547 --> 02:20.216
considering that he is
still not speaking with me.

02:20.376 --> 02:22.577

could fill him in for me?

Thanks, Felicia. I think it's gonna be fun.

03:35.497 --> 03:37.464
Listing it in the school party book

03:37.499 --> 03:39.633
as just "party" was brilliant.

Now everybody's dying to know the theme.

- The theme?
- You know, theme.

03:44.237 --> 03:46.706
The hook. What makes it crazy and special.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.475
Last year, someone actually
had the USC marching band.

03:50.201 --> 03:53.713
Oh, no marching bands for me.

03:53.747 --> 03:55.871
Shh! Don't tell me. I want to be surprised.

back down in that chair.

Are we talking about the same Jacob

04:27.140 --> 04:28.531
that reported you to the psych ward

04:28.556 --> 04:29.891
to get your license suspended?

04:29.949 --> 04:31.143
That's the one.

04:31.177 --> 04:32.820
Okay. Why are you having coffee with him?

04:33.222 --> 04:36.148
He said it was work related,
but he was kind of vague.

04:36.182 --> 04:38.348
Hey, do you think that maybe
he found out that you have

04:38.373 --> 04:40.875
a private practice and he's trying
to get your suspension extended?

04:40.900 --> 04:42.587
I hadn't thought of that.

04:42.621 --> 04:44.789
But thank you for putting that in my head.

year? I'm sure it's fine.

not to look at the real-estate website.

05:07.845 --> 05:09.436

- My painter.

over we need to upgrade

it goes on the market.

- No!

the go-between anymore, Harry.

05:29.045 --> 05:30.446
Okay. Joss, look. I know...

05:30.471 --> 05:32.864
- I know that this is awkward for you.
- Just call her!

05:32.889 --> 05:34.419
It will take all of five minutes.

05:34.473 --> 05:36.551
- I-I don't want to call her.
- Fine.

05:36.589 --> 05:38.075
If you can't talk to her, then text her.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.721
That's why texting was invented...
T o avoid any chance of intimacy.

05:40.746 --> 05:42.617
Joss, just one last thing,
okay? And then that's...

05:42.642 --> 05:43.609
that's it. And then you can be done.

05:43.674 --> 05:44.904
Harry, do you understand?

05:44.929 --> 05:46.385
This is exactly why we
can't work together...

05:46.419 --> 05:47.806

05:59.632 --> 06:01.069
But I just... I cannot, okay?

09:13.410 --> 09:14.756
[Sighs] You know, go.

09:15.655 --> 09:18.599
Go, all right? Do what you got to do.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.096
I love you. I promise

09:20.121 --> 09:22.218
I won't let this become a thing.

09:32.374 --> 09:33.640
Paintball and Tequila.

09:33.674 --> 09:37.386
Cigar bar and scotch tasting.
Rollerskating and wine.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.898
Mm. Sensing an alcoholic theme.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.015
Oh, look. Here's yours.

09:42.769 --> 09:43.970
"Party."

09:44.217 --> 09:45.683
Very descriptive, April.

09:46.812 --> 09:48.686
You want to talk about
why Daniel isn't calling

09:48.721 --> 09:51.356
or you want to explain to
me what a parent party is?

09:51.391 --> 09:52.857
[Sighs] I'm open to either.

09:52.892 --> 09:55.174
They're like these mini fundraisers.

09:55.199 --> 09:57.529
The school asks parents to
throw parties for other parents

09:57.563 --> 09:58.946
and charge them to come

09:58.971 --> 10:01.389
so that they can give the
money back to the school.

10:01.414 --> 10:03.294
Why doesn't the school
just ask for more money?

10:03.319 --> 10:05.569
Because we're supposed to be having fun.

10:05.603 --> 10:06.737
See how much fun I'm having?

10:06.771 --> 10:09.206
So what is your party?

10:11.873 --> 10:13.110
Pizza and beer.

10:15.277 --> 10:16.647
I'm canceling.

10:16.681 --> 10:18.983
Better to have no party
than a terrible party.

10:19.017 --> 10:20.051
Cancel?!

10:20.085 --> 10:22.467
Two words, sweetie... "social suicide."

10:22.492 --> 10:24.997
<i>So what? It's not like
these are my real friends.</i>

10:25.022 --> 10:27.523
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about Lucy.

10:27.558 --> 10:28.691
You screw this up,

10:28.725 --> 10:30.817
she's Ralph Macchio
before he met Mr. Miyagi.

10:30.872 --> 10:32.059
Wax on.

10:32.106 --> 10:33.430
No, what you need to do is regroup

10:33.464 --> 10:35.598
and come up with something spectacular.

10:35.632 --> 10:37.267
In four hours?

10:37.301 --> 10:38.668
Even if Joss helped me, there is no...

10:38.702 --> 10:41.108
Who said anything about Joss?

10:42.244 --> 10:43.401
What...

10:44.306 --> 10:46.748
Oh. Hey, sweetie. Hey, Peyton.

10:46.773 --> 10:48.357
I didn't know you girls were coming over.

10:48.382 --> 10:51.653
I texted you from Peyton's
phone like an hour ago.

10:51.791 --> 10:54.259
What? I never... never got that.

10:54.284 --> 10:56.749
We just need a couple frappys,
and we'll be on our way.

10:56.774 --> 10:59.941
- Are you girls going to the mall?
- [Chuckles] The mall.

11:00.538 --> 11:02.710
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that
was supposed to be a joke.

11:02.735 --> 11:04.168
Oh, we're going over to my house.

11:04.193 --> 11:05.894
My mom just put in a steam room.

11:05.989 --> 11:08.393
Oh. Well, that sounds nice, too.

11:08.957 --> 11:10.997
You know, Peyton, I would
love to meet your parents.

11:11.031 --> 11:14.033
- Are they coming to my party tonight?
- The one called "party"?

11:15.235 --> 11:16.503
Doubtful.

11:17.739 --> 11:19.121
[Cellphone clicking]

11:19.146 --> 11:22.074
They can do cocktails
Thursday between 5:30 and 6:30,

11:22.403 --> 11:23.643
if that works for you.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.661
That works for me. Thank you, Peyton.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.753
No prob.

11:27.778 --> 11:29.949
- So how about those frappys?
- Oh.

11:31.201 --> 11:32.869
No frappys.

11:35.189 --> 11:36.948
Just juice boxes.

11:42.657 --> 11:44.141
I had a lot of concerns

11:44.166 --> 11:46.446
with his consistency with the medication.

11:46.471 --> 11:48.438
I wasn't sure how many
doses he was skipping.

11:48.831 --> 11:50.833
Yeah. Well, I guess he, uh...

11:51.363 --> 11:53.817
Doesn't come across as
the most reliable patient.

11:53.842 --> 11:55.409
I'll keep that in mind.

11:56.823 --> 11:58.308
- [Sighs]
- So, you look...

11:58.333 --> 12:00.634
I've been meaning to thank
you. Oh. I'm so sorry.

12:00.659 --> 12:02.493
- No, uh, you... go ahead.
- [Sighs]

12:02.518 --> 12:03.854
I know I didn't call you back,

12:03.879 --> 12:06.380
but, um, I appreciated your message.

12:07.180 --> 12:08.579
Not many people know what to say

12:08.604 --> 12:09.905
to a person who's been shot at.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.560
But you, you were good.

12:13.975 --> 12:16.382
I'm just glad you're okay.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.578
You still working at the hospital?

12:20.220 --> 12:24.231
Actually, I just started on
my private practice again.

12:24.256 --> 12:26.623
Oh, that's... that's great to hear.

12:27.533 --> 12:28.848
I'm so relieved.

12:28.873 --> 12:32.008
Honestly, I was nervous about
reaching out to you today.

12:32.725 --> 12:35.138
I was such an ass,

12:35.708 --> 12:37.273
reporting you to the board like that.

12:37.683 --> 12:39.417
You did the right thing, Jacob.

12:39.515 --> 12:40.515
Maybe.

12:41.546 --> 12:43.299
But I did it for the wrong reasons.

12:43.397 --> 12:46.094
I was hurt that you didn't
reciprocate my feelings.

12:46.740 --> 12:47.928
Your feelings?

12:50.148 --> 12:52.008
<i>Romantic feelings?</i>

12:52.404 --> 12:55.646
You're kidding, right? What?
Y-you seriously didn't know?

12:56.228 --> 12:58.390
Um... No.

12:59.208 --> 13:01.009
How would I have known?

13:01.058 --> 13:02.115
[Chuckling] I...

13:02.597 --> 13:05.165
I guess I need to work
on my flirting techniques.

13:05.317 --> 13:08.158
Huh. I always thought I was so smooth.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.190
Well, I-I got to get back to the office.

13:11.215 --> 13:13.773
But, um, we should... we
should do this again some time.

13:13.798 --> 13:14.914
I'll... I'll call you.

13:15.532 --> 13:16.803
That sounds great.

13:17.549 --> 13:20.017
[Both chuckle]

13:25.571 --> 13:26.681
[Sighs]

13:27.267 --> 13:29.234
Oh, my God!

13:29.292 --> 13:31.494
I have had it with the
better business bureau!

13:31.519 --> 13:33.186
Seriously, what? Better than who?

13:33.211 --> 13:34.883
From where I sit, it's all spin.

13:35.645 --> 13:37.613
Yep. Great.

13:38.069 --> 13:39.814
Okay. Yeah. Thank you.

13:40.990 --> 13:43.848
This is a phone. When
someone's holding it to his ear,

13:43.873 --> 13:46.002
it usually means he's
talking to someone else.

13:46.027 --> 13:48.385
Okay. Well, what's got
all up in your bloomers?

13:48.410 --> 13:50.301
My bloomers are fine. That was Vanessa.

13:50.326 --> 13:51.935
We just got a cash offer for the house.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.261
- [Gasps] No.
- Boom.

13:53.286 --> 13:54.419
- Already?
- Yep.

13:54.444 --> 13:56.915
- That's amazing! Mazel tov, man.
- Thank you.

14:00.725 --> 14:03.233
Oh, uh, please tell me that
this isn't the whole offer.

14:03.258 --> 14:05.040
It's a bit under the asking, I know.

14:05.065 --> 14:08.036
But it's solid and it's cash, and
cash makes things go much more quickly.

14:08.036 --> 14:11.132
<i>A bit under? Harry, that's like
saying the Titanic was a bit under.</i>

14:11.157 --> 14:13.959
This is... no. Savi... Savi's
never gonna accept this.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.171
She will when you use
your real-estate expertise

14:16.196 --> 14:18.097
to convince her it's an amazing deal.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.826
Okay.

14:20.851 --> 14:22.785
First of all, nice try on the flattery.

14:22.810 --> 14:24.795
<i>Second of all, that is not an amazing deal.</i>

14:24.820 --> 14:26.378
And third of all, you need to call her.

14:27.323 --> 14:29.683
Harry, I-I know you're angry
and you have every right to be,

14:29.708 --> 14:32.227
but you can't just ignore her
and never speak to her again.

14:32.252 --> 14:33.485
It's not realistic.

14:33.510 --> 14:36.301
I really do not want to have
this conversation right now.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.322
Fine. But I-I'm not having
that conversation with Savi.

14:39.347 --> 14:42.241
If you want to accept that offer,
you're gonna have to call her yourself.

14:47.718 --> 14:49.033
[Elevator bell dings]

14:51.173 --> 14:52.788
- Take care.
- Please.

14:56.091 --> 14:57.237
[Clears throat]

14:59.983 --> 15:01.371
I am so sorry.

15:02.285 --> 15:04.928
The painter wouldn't leave
until he spoke to Harry directly,

15:04.953 --> 15:07.255
who picked up the call
right away, of course.

15:07.557 --> 15:09.853
And then his truck wouldn't
start, so I had to call AAA.

15:09.878 --> 15:12.012
You know, Savi, it's, uh... it's fine.

15:12.090 --> 15:14.557
No, no. It's not fine. You're angry.

15:14.582 --> 15:16.882
No, I'm... I'm not angry. Do I seem angry?

15:16.951 --> 15:19.418
Uh... Yeah. A little.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.568
Well, I'm not. I'm just busy.

15:21.702 --> 15:24.561
And Toni covered for you in the
meeting, so it's no big deal.

15:24.586 --> 15:26.453
Yeah, I-I noticed that she was here.

15:26.515 --> 15:27.908
<i>[Chuckles] Okay, I-I know</i>

15:27.933 --> 15:29.390
you're not gonna go there right now

15:29.415 --> 15:31.616
<i>because if you went there,
then I might get angry.</i>

15:31.641 --> 15:33.171
Toni covered your ass in that meeting,

15:33.196 --> 15:35.197
so whatever issues you
have with her, please...

15:35.222 --> 15:37.524
No, no, no, I don't have
any issues with Toni,

15:37.679 --> 15:39.764
except for the fact
that she keeps telling me

15:39.789 --> 15:42.991
how electric it is every
time you touch her elbow.

15:43.016 --> 15:44.250
Okay, I'm... I'm...

15:44.275 --> 15:46.136
I'm gonna pretend like
I didn't even hear that.

15:46.236 --> 15:49.410
[Sighs] Look. [Clears throat]

15:49.460 --> 15:52.054
The fact is, I never
should have let you go.

15:52.861 --> 15:54.558
Here, I am your boss.

15:54.583 --> 15:56.006
And that's all there is to it.

15:56.078 --> 15:58.065
I gave you the option to
play the boyfriend card,

15:58.090 --> 16:00.825
and you took it and abused it.

16:00.850 --> 16:02.226
No, Dom. That's not what I did.

16:02.251 --> 16:05.053
It is. It is. But a little piece of advice.

16:05.111 --> 16:06.640
If you play that card in the future,

16:06.671 --> 16:09.540
don't use problems with your
ex-husband to convince me.

16:10.652 --> 16:11.656
[Sighs]

16:22.557 --> 16:25.559
â™ª

16:42.282 --> 16:44.241
You throw quite a party.

16:44.266 --> 16:46.033
[Chuckles] Thanks, Felicia.

16:46.058 --> 16:48.020
Unfortunately, we need to get going.

16:48.588 --> 16:50.903
But it certainly has been exciting.

16:50.928 --> 16:52.030
Oh.

16:53.462 --> 16:54.876
Jerry, now.

17:01.384 --> 17:02.668
Do you know why they're leaving?

17:02.702 --> 17:03.912
Well, it's not to have sex.

17:03.937 --> 17:05.702
That guy wouldn't stop
staring at the waiters.

17:05.727 --> 17:06.913
[Both chuckle]

17:06.938 --> 17:09.319
They're leaving because naked
men are serving Tequila shots

17:09.345 --> 17:11.731
in a home decorating store at 6:30.

17:11.756 --> 17:13.556
Or as I call it, Monday.

17:13.878 --> 17:16.201
Speaking of which, I
could use a shot right now.

17:17.147 --> 17:18.648
[Groans]

17:21.686 --> 17:23.153
- Ooh!
- Ohh!

17:23.188 --> 17:24.717
- I'm so sorry.
- No, my fault.

17:24.742 --> 17:25.747
[Chuckles]

17:25.771 --> 17:28.892
Um... You're, uh, April, right?

17:28.961 --> 17:31.044
- This is your party.
- Guilty as charged.

17:31.069 --> 17:32.947
Oh, no. What? Are you
kidding me? This is great.

17:32.972 --> 17:35.506
Someone was saying that
you, uh, own this store.

17:35.564 --> 17:36.574
I do.

17:36.643 --> 17:39.412
Though this is not what
it normally looks like.

17:39.837 --> 17:41.238
Well, I'd love to see it someday

17:41.272 --> 17:43.073
when it's not so...

17:43.108 --> 17:44.778
Both: "Eyes wide shut."

17:45.106 --> 17:47.074
[Both chuckle]

17:48.246 --> 17:50.530
Can I get you, uh, a free drink?

17:50.948 --> 17:52.882
- Yes.
- Look at this.

17:55.285 --> 17:56.798
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

â™ª

18:04.128 --> 18:06.929
[Indistinct conversation]

18:06.963 --> 18:08.141
See ya.

18:09.299 --> 18:10.980
Are these people ever leaving?

18:11.005 --> 18:13.807
No. Because they're afraid
to go home to their kids.

18:13.832 --> 18:16.277
Which is why I will never have children.

18:16.302 --> 18:17.336
I like my home.

18:17.361 --> 18:18.995
[Gasps] So, what's the deal

18:19.020 --> 18:20.989
with you and that hot guy
you were chatting with?

18:21.058 --> 18:24.527
I think his name was Steven.
He came with a friend.

18:24.780 --> 18:26.745
It was like chemistry class with you two.

18:26.949 --> 18:28.750
Well, he did ask me out for coffee, but

18:28.784 --> 18:30.308
I said I couldn't go.

18:30.333 --> 18:33.300
What?! Why? Did you not see his butt?

18:33.455 --> 18:35.022
Does Tequila make you blind?

18:35.056 --> 18:37.712
[Groans] It's... it's
just not the right time.

18:37.737 --> 18:39.205
- I have a...
- You have a what?

18:39.394 --> 18:41.910
If you say boyfriend, I may murder you.

18:41.935 --> 18:43.722
I have Daniel.

18:43.747 --> 18:44.862
Yes, Daniel.

18:44.887 --> 18:47.288
Daniel who you haven't
heard from in three days.

18:47.313 --> 18:49.524
- Because he's out of town.
- Right.

18:49.549 --> 18:52.231
I forgot there was no way to
communicate from state to state.

18:52.387 --> 18:53.397
April!

18:53.542 --> 18:54.989
You're doing that thing you do...

18:55.014 --> 18:56.814
Putting all your eggs in one basket.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.375
The basket being Daniel,
the eggs being your vagi...

18:59.400 --> 19:01.035
I get it. And I am not.

19:01.415 --> 19:03.047
You focus all your energy on one guy,

19:03.072 --> 19:04.940
and you end up freaking him out.

19:05.063 --> 19:06.657
I promise. Daniel's feeling the pressure

19:06.682 --> 19:08.049
all the way in Virginia.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.649
- Vermont.
- Same thing.

19:10.191 --> 19:12.124
The point is, Daniel won't ever call

19:12.159 --> 19:13.910
until you go out with someone else.

19:13.935 --> 19:16.280
Trust me. That's how the universe works.

19:17.215 --> 19:19.131
[Sighs]

19:22.272 --> 19:24.095
Karen: So, you knew Jacob liked me?

19:24.120 --> 19:25.787
Of course. We all did.

19:26.073 --> 19:27.706
So why didn't I notice?

19:27.740 --> 19:29.874
Because you're blind
to your effects on men.

19:29.909 --> 19:31.042
[Chuckles] It's kind of endearing.

19:31.077 --> 19:33.700
My profession is all about reading people,

19:33.725 --> 19:35.789
and I completely misread Jacob.

19:36.416 --> 19:38.250
Well, to be fair, you know, Karen,

19:38.284 --> 19:40.795
you weren't really in the
most "datey" place last year.

19:40.953 --> 19:42.926
When was the last time
you were even on a date?

19:43.026 --> 19:45.275
Like, a real date that wasn't
with a patient or his kid?

19:46.246 --> 19:49.560
Um... I guess probably in 2000...

19:49.595 --> 19:51.262
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.

19:51.296 --> 19:53.839
If you are naming the year,
it's been way too long.

19:53.864 --> 19:55.431
You need to get back out there, sister.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.624
- All right, switch. I'm over this bag.
- [Sighs]

20:00.759 --> 20:02.072
Hi.

20:03.498 --> 20:05.008
You know, I'm not sure.

20:05.043 --> 20:06.344
It feels too soon.

20:06.378 --> 20:08.293
Are you kidding? No. It's perfect timing.

20:08.318 --> 20:10.502
You're back in practice.
You have a new place.

20:10.527 --> 20:12.294
It's a fresh start. Oh.

20:12.319 --> 20:14.026
I'll make you an online
profile like I did for April.

20:14.051 --> 20:15.084
It'll be fun.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.468
- That's okay.
- Come on!

20:17.493 --> 20:20.242
I agree with you, just
not about online dating.

20:20.725 --> 20:23.133
[Sighs] But it's time
to get back out there.

20:23.525 --> 20:25.138
And I think I know where to start.

20:27.565 --> 20:28.865
[Knock on door]

20:28.899 --> 20:30.066
Hey, Savi.

20:31.502 --> 20:33.549
- Vanessa.
- Hi.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.489
Oh, God. Did we have a meeting today?

20:36.514 --> 20:39.375
I'm so sorry. I've just been
totally scattered lately.

20:39.409 --> 20:40.899
[Chuckling] No, no. I'm just here

20:40.899 --> 20:42.795
to get a few signatures to close the deal.

20:44.342 --> 20:45.547
The deal?

20:45.582 --> 20:46.715
[Sighs]

20:46.750 --> 20:48.997
Let me guess. You never talked to Harry.

20:49.036 --> 20:51.337
No. Wait.

20:51.362 --> 20:54.644
Are you saying that he accepted
an offer without telling me?

20:54.690 --> 20:57.158
I had no idea. I assumed he told you.

20:57.183 --> 20:58.950
Mm, no. He didn't.

20:59.662 --> 21:01.229
I mean, I'm sorry.

21:01.264 --> 21:04.565
But I can't accept any offer on the house.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.669
And until I speak to Harry,

21:05.694 --> 21:07.995
<i>I don't think we should
do anything with the house</i>

21:08.509 --> 21:09.943
I understand.

21:11.046 --> 21:12.440
To save time,

21:12.474 --> 21:14.575
why don't you just let
me know when that happens?

21:17.827 --> 21:19.627
This is crazy.

21:19.834 --> 21:20.848
[Dial tone]

21:20.882 --> 21:23.117
[Dialing]

21:23.151 --> 21:25.585
<i>Hi. It's Harry. Leave a
message. I'll call you back.</i>

21:25.620 --> 21:27.254
<i>[Beep] Harry, it's Savi.</i>

21:27.289 --> 21:30.064
We really need to talk,
okay? C-can you call me back?

21:30.089 --> 21:31.095
Please?

21:32.460 --> 21:34.094
[Sighs]

21:46.080 --> 21:51.106
So, then I got to four
cars, and how could I stop?

21:51.304 --> 21:53.136
[Chuckles] I definitely don't know.

21:53.238 --> 21:54.538
I guess I've always had

21:54.611 --> 21:56.841
a collector's mentality, you know?

21:56.895 --> 21:58.699
Same thing as when I was
a kid with baseball cards.

21:58.724 --> 22:01.162
You just... you can't stop with one pack.

22:01.187 --> 22:03.823
And, uh, you just can't stop with one car.

22:03.858 --> 22:05.058
[Chuckles] Yeah,

22:05.083 --> 22:07.217
well, unless it's a jeep, in my case.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.479
Mm. Oh, don't get me wrong.

22:08.504 --> 22:09.803
I-I give to charity, too.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.037
I usually... I keep it anonymous,

22:12.062 --> 22:15.030
but, uh... Yeah.

22:15.915 --> 22:17.344
I'm pretty generous.

22:18.794 --> 22:21.303
Well, that's nice of you.

22:21.338 --> 22:24.630
Well, I-I really should be getting going.

22:24.655 --> 22:25.858
I have to say,

22:25.883 --> 22:31.087
I am proud that we did not
talk about our kids at all.

22:31.381 --> 22:35.913
It's just nice to be... Adults, you know?

22:35.952 --> 22:36.980
Mm-hmm.

22:37.219 --> 22:38.223
Well...

22:41.364 --> 22:42.926
Thank you very much for the coffee.

22:46.126 --> 22:49.895
Oh, hey. Hey! Pal, it's
11:30 in the morning.

22:50.321 --> 22:54.317
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, I
guess I misread the signs.

22:54.342 --> 22:58.261
So, uh... That's a no on the kiss?

22:58.889 --> 23:00.514
Yeah, that's a no.

23:00.709 --> 23:02.743
Well, maybe next time we just make it...

23:03.410 --> 23:04.814
Later in the day.

23:04.926 --> 23:06.013
Okay.

23:06.038 --> 23:08.172
I'll, uh, see you at school, Steven.

23:08.359 --> 23:10.527
All right. Thanks again.

23:12.801 --> 23:14.067
Don't take no for an answer.

23:14.092 --> 23:15.733
You keep calling him till
we get those signatures.

23:15.758 --> 23:17.565
All right? All right.
Let me know when you do.

23:19.509 --> 23:21.852
Hey. Uh, what's up?

23:21.958 --> 23:24.359
I have some questions
about the Fenton deal.

23:24.448 --> 23:25.543
All right. Shoot.

23:26.543 --> 23:27.546
Okay.

23:27.571 --> 23:29.872
<i>I really don't have questions
about the Fenton deal.</i>

23:29.897 --> 23:31.652
I've got that nailed down.

23:31.905 --> 23:34.072
<i>But I do have to talk
to you about something.</i>

23:34.607 --> 23:37.392
And I don't mean to...
Get anybody in trouble.

23:37.914 --> 23:39.047
What is it, Toni?

23:39.227 --> 23:40.393
It's Savi.

23:40.647 --> 23:42.339
Let me start by saying,

23:42.364 --> 23:44.665
I'm sure it would be completely different

23:44.690 --> 23:46.630
if we weren't sharing an office.

23:46.655 --> 23:48.479
Yeah. There's no need
for a preamble. Just...

23:49.198 --> 23:50.389
What's the problem?

23:50.740 --> 23:53.800
I know she's been through a difficult time,

23:53.825 --> 23:57.794
but there's just a lot of
personal stuff going on,

23:57.819 --> 23:59.764
and it's hard to get the work done.

23:59.932 --> 24:02.667
Visits from her sister, her realtor,

24:03.026 --> 24:07.696
the constant personal calls
to someone named... Harry.

24:07.721 --> 24:08.977
All right, look. [Chuckles]

24:09.002 --> 24:10.603
Let me just stop you right there.

24:10.689 --> 24:13.209
Now, w-we're not looking for you
guys to share an office forever.

24:13.234 --> 24:14.973
We're... we're looking to change that.

24:14.998 --> 24:17.119
- Oh, good.
- But more importantly,

24:17.277 --> 24:19.110
Savi's been here a long time...

24:19.317 --> 24:21.218
You know, a lot longer than you.

24:21.610 --> 24:23.344
And you're right. She
has been through a lot.

24:23.369 --> 24:25.070
So I think a little respect

24:25.095 --> 24:28.097
and patience would go a long way.

24:28.953 --> 24:29.998
I'm sorry.

24:30.023 --> 24:31.890
Oh, there's... there's no need to be sorry.

24:31.915 --> 24:33.144
I mean, we're all just...

24:33.169 --> 24:35.366
We're all just adjusting here.

24:37.598 --> 24:39.603
That's exactly it.

24:41.472 --> 24:44.453
I'm having a hard time
adjusting to the change,

24:45.171 --> 24:47.054
especially the change between us.

24:47.614 --> 24:49.811
You've shown me the ropes around here

24:49.836 --> 24:53.138
and put me on some incredible cases. And...

24:53.450 --> 24:55.613
now every time you come into my office,

24:55.638 --> 24:58.744
it's... Always to talk to her.

24:58.823 --> 25:01.307
[Scoffs] It's nothing personal.

25:01.492 --> 25:03.710
You've got cases. Savi's got cases.

25:03.735 --> 25:06.270
It's all about the, uh...
it's all about the work.

25:06.731 --> 25:07.794
I know.

25:09.329 --> 25:12.943
I was just hoping that it
could be about more than that.

25:16.273 --> 25:18.741
I like you, Dom.

25:20.046 --> 25:21.496
[Sighs]

25:21.692 --> 25:25.662
Toni, um, I'm... I'm flattered.

25:26.283 --> 25:29.023
But it's... it's just not a possibility

25:29.206 --> 25:30.866
for a variety of reasons, not the least

25:30.891 --> 25:33.456
of which is that I'm your boss.

25:34.072 --> 25:35.232
Right.

25:35.401 --> 25:37.702
Of course. [Chuckles]

25:38.127 --> 25:40.354
Uh, I feel like a complete idiot.

25:40.379 --> 25:41.460
Oh, no. No.

25:42.465 --> 25:44.600
Can we pretend this
conversation never happened?

25:44.634 --> 25:46.505
- I-it's forgotten.
- [Both chuckle]

25:47.115 --> 25:48.949
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

25:55.645 --> 25:57.813
[Sighs]

26:00.211 --> 26:01.595
[Sighs]

26:03.186 --> 26:04.652
â™ª

26:04.687 --> 26:07.446
[Sighs] It just doesn't feel right.

26:07.652 --> 26:09.065
<i>Well, it certainly looks right.</i>

26:09.090 --> 26:10.891
And I say that as a former lesbian.

26:11.164 --> 26:12.778
Is it a bit too much?

26:12.803 --> 26:14.612
No, take it from someone
who's had more dates

26:14.637 --> 26:17.250
in the last week than you
have in the last two years.

26:17.275 --> 26:19.310
There's no such thing as too much.

26:19.467 --> 26:20.500
You look gorgeous.

26:20.903 --> 26:22.162
Thank you.

26:22.339 --> 26:23.637
I'm still changing.

26:23.851 --> 26:25.786
- No!
- [Cellphone rings]

26:26.914 --> 26:28.516
- [Cellphone beeps]
- Stop it! Stop it!

26:28.541 --> 26:30.342
Hello? Okay. Yeah. Let him up.

26:30.367 --> 26:31.879
- [Exhales deeply]
- Too late.

26:31.947 --> 26:33.047
He's here.

26:33.082 --> 26:34.166
Off you go.

26:35.084 --> 26:38.213
Okay, honey. Listen.
It's just a date, okay?

26:38.338 --> 26:40.221
You're just dipping your toe in the pool.

26:40.255 --> 26:41.889
You don't have to go skinny dipping.

26:41.924 --> 26:43.758
<i>Ooh, unless you want to go skinny dipping.</i>

26:43.792 --> 26:44.828
"Skinny dipping" means sex.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.476
- [Knock on door]
- You're a disturbing person.

26:46.501 --> 26:47.502
Oh!

26:53.605 --> 26:54.613
Hi.

26:54.638 --> 26:56.951
Karen Kim. Damn.

26:57.067 --> 26:58.934
You look even hotter in real life.

27:00.509 --> 27:02.607
I meant... Away from the hospital.

27:02.632 --> 27:04.442
[Chuckles] I knew what you meant.

27:04.679 --> 27:05.896
Thank you.

27:05.932 --> 27:07.899
Um, this is my friend Joss.

27:08.349 --> 27:10.150
We worked together in the E.R.

27:10.175 --> 27:11.642
Um, Casey, this is Joss.

27:11.848 --> 27:13.969
Can I just say how psyched
I am that you called.

27:13.994 --> 27:15.861
I mean, completely surprised, but psyched.

27:15.886 --> 27:17.497
Okay. You guys have so much fun.

27:17.522 --> 27:19.289
I don't want to see you
home before midnight.

27:19.314 --> 27:21.030
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

27:22.986 --> 27:24.493
Ooh. He's cute.

27:25.866 --> 27:27.700
[Knocking on door]

27:31.784 --> 27:32.787
Okay.

27:33.874 --> 27:35.007
[Knocking continues]

27:35.042 --> 27:36.287
Okay!

27:37.311 --> 27:38.466
[Sighs]

27:38.744 --> 27:41.313
We really need to work
on our communication.

27:46.555 --> 27:47.874
What do you want, Savi?

27:48.055 --> 27:49.722
Well, I wanted you to call me back.

27:49.756 --> 27:51.290
But since that wasn't happening,

27:51.324 --> 27:52.925
I had to come here to talk to you.

27:52.959 --> 27:54.059
Okay.

27:54.627 --> 27:56.167
I assume this is about the house.

27:56.192 --> 27:59.034
Yeah, did you really
think you could sell it

27:59.059 --> 28:00.848
without talking to me first?

28:02.336 --> 28:04.399
I figured you'd either
like the offer or not.

28:04.424 --> 28:06.392
Savi, you don't like it,
we'll wait for another one.

28:06.417 --> 28:08.440
But at a certain point, I'm
not gonna pay the mortgage

28:08.474 --> 28:10.275
if you're gonna refuse
every offer that comes along.

28:10.310 --> 28:12.277
No, no, no, no. I'm not refusing anything.

28:12.312 --> 28:13.584
But this is a big decision,

28:13.609 --> 28:15.643
and it's one that we
should discuss together.

28:16.174 --> 28:17.574
It's our home.

28:18.144 --> 28:21.080
<i>It's not my home. It's not my home.</i>

28:21.354 --> 28:23.822
It's just one last piece of
business we need to settle

28:23.856 --> 28:24.928
before we can get divorced.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.642
[Sighs] Wow.

28:30.374 --> 28:34.210
You know, you, uh...
Don't have to be so mean.

28:34.417 --> 28:36.129
- You're trying to hurt me.
- I'm not.

28:37.080 --> 28:40.114
I'm not trying to hurt you.
I'm trying to get rid of you.

28:40.439 --> 28:42.840
We don't need to talk anymore, okay?

28:42.874 --> 28:44.408
You've made your choice.

28:44.443 --> 28:46.244
Yeah, but that doesn't
negate our life together.

28:46.278 --> 28:47.545
Of course it does.

28:47.579 --> 28:50.141
Of course it does! What do you think?!

28:50.915 --> 28:53.409
That you can humiliate
me not once, but twice.

28:53.434 --> 28:54.501
- I never...
- Twice!

28:54.526 --> 28:55.993
You cheated on me and I forgave you,

28:56.018 --> 28:57.318
and you still chose him.

28:57.343 --> 29:01.513
<i>I chose you, and you still chose him.</i>

29:04.011 --> 29:05.978
And now what? I'm
supposed to be your friend?

29:06.003 --> 29:07.022
Why?

29:07.638 --> 29:09.043
Because you... you can't stand the thought

29:09.068 --> 29:10.818
of someone not liking you, Savi?

29:10.843 --> 29:13.595
Because you can't stand being
thought of as the bad guy?

29:14.372 --> 29:15.739
But you are.

29:15.774 --> 29:18.196
You are. You're the bad guy, Savi.

29:19.365 --> 29:22.576
You're the most selfish
woman I've ever known.

29:29.324 --> 29:32.942
You only chose me because
you thought I might die.

29:33.758 --> 29:35.292
Excuse me?

29:35.326 --> 29:38.461
<i>You had months to take me back,</i>

29:38.496 --> 29:40.179
but you couldn't make up your mind.

29:40.340 --> 29:42.970
You were in. You were out.

29:43.135 --> 29:45.270
And then you just totally disappeared.

29:45.295 --> 29:46.329
I didn't...

29:46.354 --> 29:48.843
I didn't hear from you for... for weeks.

29:49.505 --> 29:52.095
Then you just... you just showed up.

29:53.476 --> 29:56.261
So, what? I was supposed
to trust you again?

29:56.286 --> 29:58.392
I'm sorry. I-I couldn't.

30:00.851 --> 30:02.167
So, yeah.

30:03.898 --> 30:05.297
I made some mistakes.

30:07.624 --> 30:09.017
But so did you.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.712
Are we done here?

30:16.080 --> 30:17.222
Yeah.

30:25.274 --> 30:26.742
[Door closes]

30:26.776 --> 30:28.544
[Sighs]

30:36.911 --> 30:40.354
Exactly how rich is he?
Like, seven figures rich?

30:40.354 --> 30:41.989
Eight? Nine?

30:42.023 --> 30:43.657
I think you're missing the point here.

30:43.691 --> 30:45.492
I didn't even want to go out
with him in the first place,

30:45.526 --> 30:47.494
and I let myself get caught up in it.

30:47.528 --> 30:48.528
Oh, here we go.

30:48.563 --> 30:50.096
They always blame the gay best friend.

30:50.130 --> 30:53.266
I am blaming me, okay? Not you.

30:53.301 --> 30:56.269
I just shouldn't have let
myself get all caught up

30:56.304 --> 30:58.305
in all this nonsense, you know?

30:58.339 --> 30:59.372
Making some huge party

30:59.407 --> 31:01.040
to impress people I don't even know,

31:01.075 --> 31:03.375
going out with a guy
just so I can fool myself

31:03.410 --> 31:05.778
into believing I am something I'm not.

31:05.813 --> 31:07.313
<i>What does that mean?</i>

31:08.578 --> 31:10.149
It means you were right.

31:10.184 --> 31:12.651
I am a "one basket" kind of girl,

31:12.686 --> 31:14.353
and Daniel is that basket.

31:14.387 --> 31:16.055
Oh, sweetie.

31:16.872 --> 31:18.791
You really think he's never gonna call?

31:18.826 --> 31:20.960
I don't know. But what I do know...

31:20.994 --> 31:23.295
<i>that if he doesn't call, he's an idiot.</i>

31:24.253 --> 31:25.666
Thank you.

31:32.260 --> 31:34.505
Hi. Sorry. Can I get an iced
tea like five minutes ago?

31:34.540 --> 31:36.174
- [Chuckles] Thanks.
- Hi!

31:36.209 --> 31:39.010
Hi. Mm. You look pretty.

31:39.045 --> 31:40.345
Thank you.

31:40.901 --> 31:42.573
Okay. Tell me everything...

31:42.598 --> 31:44.537
where you went, what you ate,
what you did, how it ended.

31:44.562 --> 31:46.047
Don't leave anything out.

31:46.552 --> 31:50.020
He took me to a pool
hall. We ate buffalo wings.

31:50.730 --> 31:51.920
That's horrifying.

31:51.945 --> 31:53.880
Not my first choice, but it was fine.

31:54.159 --> 31:55.559
The whole thing was fine.

31:55.593 --> 31:57.795
Please tell me that he made
up for his poor dining choices

31:57.829 --> 31:58.996
by being a voracious lover.

31:59.030 --> 32:01.531
What? No. We didn't even kiss.

32:02.334 --> 32:05.223
Okay. So, this is the worst date
ever? Is that what you're telling me?

32:05.223 --> 32:09.049
<i>I don't think it was the worst
 date ever. It was just "eh."</i>

32:09.200 --> 32:10.694
- "Eh"?
- But it's fine.

32:10.719 --> 32:13.353
It's not like I ever
thought Casey was the one.

32:13.717 --> 32:15.943
Well, then, why the
heck did you ask him out?

32:16.353 --> 32:18.320
Because you said I needed to get out there,

32:18.355 --> 32:21.158
and he'd already asked me
out a bunch of times, so...

32:21.183 --> 32:22.817
Oh, no, no, no.

32:22.842 --> 32:25.951
You asked him out because
you knew he was gonna say yes.

32:26.601 --> 32:28.911
Karen, you can't cheat
the dating game like that.

32:28.936 --> 32:31.365
You can't ask people out because
you know they're gonna say yes.

32:31.390 --> 32:33.685
<i>You have to ask them out
because you want them to say yes.</i>

32:33.710 --> 32:35.521
What if the person you want to ask out

32:35.546 --> 32:36.661
doesn't want to go out with you?

32:36.686 --> 32:38.526
[Chuckles] What are you, 12?

32:38.551 --> 32:41.191
Welcome to the 99.999% of people.

32:41.300 --> 32:43.033
You ask them out, you get rejected,

32:43.058 --> 32:44.525
it's weird, you move on.

32:44.550 --> 32:47.346
But you really got to want
it, or else what's the point?

32:50.040 --> 32:51.507
Seriously. What?

32:51.532 --> 32:53.466
Do they make their iced tea in India?

33:03.586 --> 33:06.054
- Oh. Hey, you.
- Hi.

33:06.192 --> 33:08.604
I was just gonna go lay by the
pool. What are you doing here?

33:08.882 --> 33:10.535
<i>This is still my house, right?</i>

33:10.560 --> 33:13.161
You didn't accept an offer, too, did you?

33:13.556 --> 33:14.906
You know what I mean.

33:15.239 --> 33:17.502
[Sighs] I couldn't go in to work today.

33:18.321 --> 33:19.991
I just couldn't.

33:20.458 --> 33:21.779
Is everything okay?

33:22.038 --> 33:24.090
[Sighs] Not really.

33:25.854 --> 33:27.881
I went to see Harry yesterday

33:27.906 --> 33:30.708
to try to force him into talking to me,

33:30.733 --> 33:32.975
and it was just awful.

33:33.752 --> 33:36.177
It was worse than I could
have ever even imagined.

33:36.202 --> 33:37.336
[Groans]

33:37.361 --> 33:39.962
Sweetie, I'm sorry. Come here.

33:40.327 --> 33:43.797
Yeah, I should have listened to you

33:43.822 --> 33:46.456
and just let it lie, given him some time.

33:46.481 --> 33:49.116
No, no, no. Don't second-guess yourself.

33:49.141 --> 33:51.056
You did what you had to
do, and now it's done.

33:51.194 --> 33:53.685
The worst part's over, even if it hurt.

33:53.710 --> 33:56.671
[Chuckles] Yeah. It hurt.

33:56.930 --> 33:58.731
[Sighs]

33:58.790 --> 33:59.790
Well, hey.

33:59.815 --> 34:02.784
At least now you can, you know,

34:02.809 --> 34:04.529
get on with your life
with Dom and everything.

34:04.554 --> 34:07.712
Ugh. Dom's mad at me because
I'm spending all this energy

34:07.737 --> 34:09.538
on Harry and the house.

34:09.563 --> 34:11.630
We got into this whole thing at work.

34:11.656 --> 34:14.857
It's... it's just all really a... mess,

34:15.232 --> 34:19.168
which is why... I accepted an offer.

34:20.684 --> 34:21.806
You did?

34:23.208 --> 34:25.649
Well, I hope it wasn't that
crap offer that Harry wanted.

34:25.674 --> 34:26.975
No, it's a different offer...

34:27.000 --> 34:29.359
Almost asking price, 45-day escrow.

34:30.130 --> 34:32.766
Hey. You sure about this?

34:33.518 --> 34:34.706
No.

34:36.659 --> 34:39.630
I don't think I'll ever
be totally sure about it.

34:42.545 --> 34:45.678
But I can't keep holding on to
something that doesn't exist anymore.

34:45.893 --> 34:47.076
Hmm.

34:48.074 --> 34:50.313
[Sighs]

34:52.396 --> 34:53.806
[Knock on door]

34:57.566 --> 34:58.850
[Sighs]

35:02.386 --> 35:03.869
- Hi!
- April.

35:03.894 --> 35:06.195
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.

35:06.220 --> 35:08.636
Peyton talks about you
and your daughter nonstop.

35:08.661 --> 35:09.861
- Oh!
- I'm Samantha.

35:09.886 --> 35:12.297
It is so great to meet you, Samantha.

35:12.471 --> 35:13.638
Come on in.

35:13.663 --> 35:15.594
My husband's getting the wine from the car.

35:15.619 --> 35:17.754
You wouldn't, by chance,
have a decanter, would you?

35:17.931 --> 35:20.949
It's a 1955 chÃƒÂ¢teau haut-brion.
It really should breathe.

35:20.974 --> 35:23.468
You didn't have to bring
anything. You're my guests.

35:23.493 --> 35:25.458
Oh, it's our pleasure. [Chuckles]

35:27.370 --> 35:30.538
Steven. Nice to meet you.

35:30.563 --> 35:32.973
It's ni... hi. Nice to meet you, too.

35:33.264 --> 35:36.545
Uh, here's a little
something to get us started.

35:38.003 --> 35:40.225
Great. Come on in.

36:04.940 --> 36:06.677
Hey, Jacob.

36:07.257 --> 36:09.258
It's Karen.

36:10.727 --> 36:12.319
Jacob, it's Karen.

36:12.648 --> 36:14.158
Hi, Jacob!

36:14.183 --> 36:16.050
It's Karen! How are you doing?

36:18.107 --> 36:20.242
[Chuckles]

36:20.267 --> 36:22.701
[Chuckling] How are you doing?

36:24.629 --> 36:26.095
[Sighs]

36:26.427 --> 36:27.894
Jacob: Hello?

36:28.647 --> 36:30.350
Jacob. It's Karen.

36:30.510 --> 36:31.758
Hey!

36:32.484 --> 36:33.535
What's going on?

36:34.060 --> 36:35.083
Nothing much.

36:35.108 --> 36:38.410
I just wanted to say how
nice it was to see you again.

36:38.896 --> 36:39.986
Yeah, yeah.

36:40.011 --> 36:41.011
I felt the same way.

36:41.266 --> 36:42.752
Oh, and I also wanted to tell you,

36:42.777 --> 36:45.446
um, I had a date last night.

36:45.567 --> 36:48.941
Okay. Well, um, congratulations.

36:48.966 --> 36:51.000
Oh, no, no. No. I'm only telling you...

36:51.079 --> 36:52.547
um, I asked this guy out

36:52.572 --> 36:56.015
because I didn't have
the nerve to ask you out.

36:56.944 --> 36:59.245
And I realized halfway
through the date that I

36:59.270 --> 37:01.396
would have much rather been with you.

37:01.421 --> 37:04.229
So now I'm calling you like I
should have in the first place.

37:04.318 --> 37:07.954
Wow. I-I did not... See that coming.

37:08.217 --> 37:09.289
Mm.

37:09.384 --> 37:11.018
I know it's a little out of nowhere,

37:11.043 --> 37:13.445
um, considering we hadn't
spoken in eight months

37:13.470 --> 37:17.963
and you've said you didn't have
any feelings for me anymore.

37:21.206 --> 37:23.631
Oh, God. You're not saying anything.

37:24.209 --> 37:26.143
[Chuckling] This was a terrible idea.

37:26.325 --> 37:28.146
No, no. Karen, it's not that.

37:28.171 --> 37:30.306
It's just, you know, there's

37:30.331 --> 37:33.452
a little too much history
between us, you know?

37:33.571 --> 37:37.740
I just... Don't think
it's the greatest idea.

37:38.330 --> 37:39.630
Karen?

37:40.928 --> 37:42.028
You still there?

37:42.813 --> 37:44.140
Yeah, I'm here.

37:44.317 --> 37:45.950
But look. Why... why don't we, um...

37:45.975 --> 37:48.239
why don't we get lunch sometime?

37:48.384 --> 37:49.451
A-as friends.

37:49.907 --> 37:51.774
Sure, great. Great.

37:52.658 --> 37:54.778
All right, great. Well,
I'll... I'll talk to you soon.

37:55.407 --> 37:56.708
And, Karen?

37:57.561 --> 38:00.292
Thank you for... for calling.

38:00.864 --> 38:02.128
[Chuckling] Okay.

38:04.436 --> 38:06.103
[Sighs]

38:13.230 --> 38:15.231
What's going on in here?

38:15.403 --> 38:18.071
Just finishing up my next art project.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.179
- You all ready for bed?
- Yep.

38:20.204 --> 38:21.905
- Teeth brushed?
- Yep.

38:22.339 --> 38:24.907
So, how were Peyton's mom and dad?

38:25.678 --> 38:30.245
Oh, they were... Interesting.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.805
So, were they weird?

38:31.830 --> 38:33.798
Peyton always says they're kind of weird.

38:34.429 --> 38:36.631
They were perfectly nice.

38:36.853 --> 38:39.193
Now, hold on. I got something for you.

38:41.058 --> 38:42.491
â™ª Mm

38:43.760 --> 38:45.315
Open it.

38:49.824 --> 38:50.887
[Chuckles]

38:52.722 --> 38:54.235
Oh, my God.

38:54.269 --> 38:55.436
Really?

38:55.470 --> 38:58.235
Thank you so much!
You're the best mom ever!

38:59.467 --> 39:01.103
Now, I just want you to know

39:01.128 --> 39:02.513
that this is your birthday gift,

39:02.538 --> 39:04.172
Valentine's day gift, Christmas gift,

39:04.197 --> 39:05.665
and whatever else you can think of.

39:05.690 --> 39:07.791
I thought I wasn't allowed to have a phone.

39:07.816 --> 39:08.982
Well, you weren't,

39:09.007 --> 39:11.476
until I remembered how
hard it can be to fit in.

39:11.638 --> 39:12.939
You're not the only one feeling

39:13.122 --> 39:14.929
peer pressure at your new school.

39:14.954 --> 39:16.254
<i>Even at your age?</i>

39:16.811 --> 39:19.262
Yes, even at my ancient age,

39:19.299 --> 39:22.702
the desire to impress people
doesn't just... go away.

39:22.876 --> 39:25.477
But I got you this because you earned it.

39:25.934 --> 39:28.315
These kids may have more stuff than you,

39:28.362 --> 39:30.405
<i>but you have more heart.</i>

39:30.506 --> 39:31.506
And more importantly,

39:31.531 --> 39:33.293
now I get to reach you whenever I want.

39:33.385 --> 39:34.853
I'm sending my first text to you.

39:34.878 --> 39:36.545
Oh. Standing by.

39:37.011 --> 39:39.547
[Cellphone clicking]

39:41.116 --> 39:43.186
What is wrong with my phone?

39:43.631 --> 39:46.599
Um, I may have changed some settings

39:46.624 --> 39:48.233
- while I was on your phone.
- [Sighs]

39:48.641 --> 39:49.992
[Cellphone chimes] There we go.

and why's he texting you?

40:27.747 --> 40:29.714
But I did let Mitchell's office know, okay?

40:29.739 --> 40:30.797
So don't worry about...

40:30.822 --> 40:33.457
Take a breath, all right?
I-I'm not calling about work.

40:33.501 --> 40:34.634
You weren't?

40:34.808 --> 40:36.168
No. I'm, um,

40:36.660 --> 40:39.761
calling as your boyfriend, you know?

40:39.786 --> 40:41.607
Checking in on my girlfriend.

40:41.774 --> 40:43.376
But I thought you were mad at me.

40:43.533 --> 40:45.210
Yeah, I was. I was. But you know what?

40:45.235 --> 40:47.804
That... that was just me being stupid.

40:48.011 --> 40:49.445
I'm... I'm sorry.

40:49.527 --> 40:52.239
Look, I know you're going
through a lot right now,

40:52.264 --> 40:55.047
and, uh, yeah, I should
be more sensitive to that.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.974
Look. You can always talk to me.

40:58.093 --> 41:00.395
Even if it's about Harry.

41:02.361 --> 41:03.432
I'm sorry, too.

41:03.552 --> 41:06.354
I should have never put you
in that position at work.

41:06.599 --> 41:10.069
From now on, you are only
my boyfriend after hours.

41:10.131 --> 41:11.139
Deal.

41:11.164 --> 41:14.266
And I promise I won't bring
up that Toni stuff anymore.

41:14.291 --> 41:17.167
That's just... me being stupid.

41:17.192 --> 41:18.199
[Sighs]

41:19.911 --> 41:21.746
Um, listen.

41:21.771 --> 41:24.341
I'm gonna work from the
office for a few hours today

41:24.366 --> 41:26.834
'cause it's quiet on the weekend.

41:27.145 --> 41:29.981
But, uh, I can come over
when I'm done if you want.

41:30.940 --> 41:32.756
You know what? I'm still pretty tired.

41:32.790 --> 41:35.556
But can I see how I feel
later and give you a call?

41:35.581 --> 41:36.763
Sure. No problem.

41:36.876 --> 41:38.500
Okay. Bye.

41:39.345 --> 41:40.535
[Telephone beeps]

41:41.772 --> 41:43.067
[Knock on door]

41:51.141 --> 41:53.085
Hi. Can I help you?

41:53.110 --> 41:54.375
Yeah. It's Zack.

41:54.999 --> 41:58.330
We met the other day. I
came for... the open house.

41:58.355 --> 42:00.788
Oh, yeah. Uh, hi.

42:01.260 --> 42:02.894
The house isn't on the market anymore.

42:02.919 --> 42:04.590
I actually accepted an offer.

42:05.889 --> 42:07.486
Oh, that's okay.

42:08.351 --> 42:11.629
Wasn't really interested
in the house anyway.

42:12.437 --> 42:14.699
I just wanted to meet you, Savannah.

42:17.833 --> 42:20.004
We need to talk.
