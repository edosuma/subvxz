out there,

And they ignored it.

08:25.154 --> 08:26.563

got them for their birthday?

08:26.732 --> 08:28.064
Yes, she did.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.991
She posted on Instagram without
tagging you or thanking you.

08:30.085 --> 08:31.993

08:32.087 --> 08:33.903

26:56.115 --> 26:57.781
but I'm just looking out
for you and Brittney

26:57.933 --> 27:02.361

-Right.
-Come here.

27:10.779 --> 27:12.379
I love you, Mommy.

What--why are you doing that?
Can you stop that?

27:32.134 --> 27:33.150
You said you have
a show to produce.

27:33.301 --> 27:35.377

-I'm saving your life.

as we selected
the Big Leap Dance Company.

29:56.370 --> 30:00.022
Monica, is it time
to talk to the cast?

30:00.040 --> 30:02.207
Oh, it's time.
I'm ready.

30:02.301 --> 30:05.027
But first, we have
a very special guest.

30:05.045 --> 30:06.545
You know him
from his nine seasons

30:06.697 --> 30:07.954
as a tight end
for the Detroit Lions.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.974
But at our dance studio,
we simply know him as Reggie.

Ladies and gentlemen,
Reggie Sadler.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.313

30:27.067 --> 30:28.641
<i> -All right.</i>
-See that?

30:28.661 --> 30:30.385
You cannot teach that.
It gives me chills.

30:30.554 --> 30:31.903
REGGIE: I think
what impressed me the most

30:31.997 --> 30:33.479
was the talent
in this cast.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.833
I mean, I can barely even begin
to describe the dancing.

30:35.984 --> 30:37.225
You know what?

30:37.319 --> 30:39.169
I think maybe we should
just take a look, huh?

30:39.321 --> 30:40.820
You heard him.
Let's take a look.

30:59.766 --> 31:02.675
Well, Simon, you're one
of our ballroom dancers.

31:02.695 --> 31:06.922
Is there anyone in the cast
who surprised you?

31:07.015 --> 31:08.198
His sister.

31:08.350 --> 31:10.108
Well, I shouldn't say
my sister,

31:10.202 --> 31:12.536
but I'm gonna say
my sister Brittney.

31:12.763 --> 31:16.290
-BRITTNEY: Oh!
-She surprises me every day.

31:17.267 --> 31:21.211
But...Justin surprises me more,

31:21.363 --> 31:25.607
his talent,
his body awareness,

31:25.700 --> 31:28.960
annoying how fast
he picks up choreography.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.721
Justin's undeniable.

I might have looked
a little tough

31:34.801 --> 31:37.728

I'm a sucker for romance.
