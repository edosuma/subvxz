00:22.239 --> 00:23.936
- Nice to set eyes on you,
Nova.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.329
- Good to see you too, boss.

00:30.508 --> 00:31.466
- Penda!

00:34.034 --> 00:35.078
- Why is she here?

00:35.122 --> 00:36.732
- She works for me.

00:38.647 --> 00:41.867
- You are walking
a very tight rope.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.043
- I had to prove my loyalty.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.873
- You're gonna use this
to keep in touch.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.266
You're in our circle.

00:50.354 --> 00:53.618

Just read it.

- Elliot.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.239
What the hell happened?

01:07.110 --> 01:10.461
- Drugs.
Someone--someone dosed me.

01:10.505 --> 01:12.768
- Okay, we need to get you
to a hospital immediately.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.161

- Yeah.

I need you...

To let me in.

01:21.907 --> 01:24.171
Let me in.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.478
- Come on.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.439
There's a protocol

01:31.482 --> 01:34.833
when a UC is forced
to take a controlled substance.

01:34.877 --> 01:41.927

I felt I had to come here.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.277

01:43.320 --> 01:46.584
- We never talked.

01:48.282 --> 01:53.113
We never talked
about what happened.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.549
- I have nothing more to say

01:54.592 --> 01:56.333
about what happened
with Navarro.

01:56.377 --> 01:59.206
- Not Navarro. Us.

02:01.686 --> 02:04.472
- Elliot, now's not the time
for us to talk.

02:04.515 --> 02:08.345
Now is the time for us

02:08.389 --> 02:10.956

and lab-tested,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.394

02:13.437 --> 02:15.526

02:20.052 --> 02:22.925
- I didn't write the letter.

02:30.672 --> 02:31.847

02:53.521 --> 02:58.178
- Yes.
It was her idea.

02:58.221 --> 03:02.443
It would be easier
to talk when...

03:06.229 --> 03:10.364
We see each other

03:12.235 --> 03:16.152
I tried and I tried,
and then...

03:16.196 --> 03:22.419
Kathy helped dictate.

03:25.509 --> 03:30.210
- That what we were
to each other was never real.

And that we got in the way

03:36.564 --> 03:43.179

and where we needed to be.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.399

Um, it was administered orally

06:32.957 --> 06:34.350
With her mouth.
