WEBVTT

00:06.540 --> 00:08.486
Whoa! Look at that.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.049
They saw me.

00:10.477 --> 00:11.615
Get that film.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.291
This vehicle was hit by rocket fire.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.624
We don't know that.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.265
We are about to divide up the United States.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.537
Get him. Get him.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

02:02.789 --> 02:04.029
Piece of cake.

02:04.491 --> 02:08.836
Collective! Collective! You're
over-torquing. You're over-torquing.

02:09.496 --> 02:12.534
Pull in some collective. Not that much.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.271
Okay.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.616
Not bad, huh?

02:21.708 --> 02:23.688
Okay, okay. So, I'm learn’n.

02:23.777 --> 02:27.315
You know, you've got to admit, this isn't
your ordinary powered puddle jumper.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.292
No, you're doing fine.

02:29.349 --> 02:30.953
- Really?
- Really.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.760
- Great. Well, then, when can I fly…
- No.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.130
Come on, Mr. Santini.

02:36.223 --> 02:40.171
Caitlin, you will not crew Airwolf. Not yet.

02:40.727 --> 02:42.468
Then why am I being checked out?

02:42.529 --> 02:45.806
'Cause we need a backup, in case
something happens to me or String.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.642
Oh, I get it.

02:48.702 --> 02:52.240
I'm good enough to fly Airwolf if
something happens to one of you,

02:52.305 --> 02:54.683
but if nothing happens, I'm not good enough.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.220
Caitlin, you write this down.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.586
You will not become a 3rd pilot in this cockpit.

02:58.645 --> 03:01.216
And that's the last word on this subject.

03:02.649 --> 03:07.621
What qualifies for "something
happening to you or String?"

03:26.573 --> 03:30.180
Oh, my!

03:33.146 --> 03:37.652
Made my gas money today, haven't I?

03:48.462 --> 03:50.806
Oh, would you look at that?

05:04.471 --> 05:05.643
Stop it.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.586
Get that jeep. Move!

06:00.894 --> 06:03.238
- Now let me understand this.
- You don't like the plan.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.435
- I didn't say that.
- I did.

06:05.498 --> 06:07.102
I'm just trying to get it all straight.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.704
- Now, let me explain it again…
- Let me explain.

06:09.769 --> 06:13.273
One, you got that desert
film job by underbidding us.

06:13.340 --> 06:16.048
Two, you want us to fill your contract

06:16.109 --> 06:17.520
for less than what you're getting.

06:17.577 --> 06:20.456
Man, I'm losing money the moment
I rev my engine. Hawke,

06:20.513 --> 06:21.992
oh pal, buddy, come on.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.426
So why do you have to
make it on our buns?

06:24.484 --> 06:25.895
- Makes sense.
- What?

06:25.952 --> 06:28.956
It's all gassed up, the camera's
loaded, it's ready to go.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.365
It'll take you 3 hours, tops.

06:30.423 --> 06:31.595
Here's the coordinates, right here.

06:31.658 --> 06:34.969
Sam, you are a disaster
looking for a place to happen.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.632
But you're not gonna happen on us.

06:36.696 --> 06:37.834
Come on, String.

06:37.898 --> 06:38.933
String.

06:39.299 --> 06:40.642
Hi, Sam.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.907
A fellow needs some recreation, huh?

06:49.342 --> 06:51.151
Be ready in a second, hon.

06:52.445 --> 06:55.483
I can't pass up a relationship
like this, now can I, man?

06:55.548 --> 06:56.526
String.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.824
Please, please, please.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.125
- No!
- Sure.

07:00.186 --> 07:01.665
Why?

07:03.156 --> 07:05.193
Well, the fellow does need some recreation.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.130
Listen, when you guys are done,

07:07.193 --> 07:09.901
take the desert footage over to
the Harcourt Lab for processing.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.170
I promised the job for Thursday afternoon.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.768
So have ‘em deliver it back, okay?

07:13.833 --> 07:16.609
You want 8x10’s or wallet size?

07:17.003 --> 07:19.984
Funny. Real funny, guys.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.359
- How soon will the others arrive?
- 72 hours.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.326
I said 36, at the outside.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.522
Well, the arrangements were
more difficult than I expected.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.496
What arrangements? To kill me or see me?

07:36.556 --> 07:39.560
Look, they're all coming. Sloane from Miami,

07:39.826 --> 07:41.806
Barlucci, Marcus from Detroit.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.908
All friends and supporters.

07:44.497 --> 07:46.636
How secure am I here?

07:46.700 --> 07:48.737
We're completely isolated.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.408
The girls had no idea where they were going.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.179
We're in an oasis in the middle of the desert.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.687
In fact, no one enters this compound
unless I say so. No one leaves.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.616
These next few days don't exist.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.952
You don't exist.

08:03.316 --> 08:07.128
One might even say you're dead.

08:22.235 --> 08:26.342
What irks me is our bid on this job
would have let me pay a few bills

08:26.406 --> 08:29.148
and hire somebody to overhaul the Stearman.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.254
What are you saying, Sam stuck it to us?

08:34.179 --> 08:36.352
Well, he does it with pretty good style.

08:38.551 --> 08:42.397
Boy, and the dolls he gets. I'd
just like to have his rejects.

08:45.558 --> 08:48.232
Okay, start filming now.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.398
What did Sam say he wanted?

08:49.462 --> 08:51.271
Just some general stock footage?

08:51.931 --> 08:53.774
There's the train tracks.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.836
There's a train on it.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.506
So, he gets a train.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.571
Got it.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.985
Well, that should be enough.
What's next on the list?

09:03.043 --> 09:07.082
Open ground, some shacks, cars on
a desert road. Stuff like that.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.118
Right.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.595
Whoa! Look at that.

09:14.921 --> 09:18.027
What that? I'll run a few feet up to show you.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.444
Oh, you pretty thing.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.343
Oh, String, eat your heart out.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.978
Hey, you better give us another run by.

09:33.039 --> 09:36.077
Just so we get full coverage for Sam.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.453
A helicopter? What the hell
are they doing up there?

09:43.516 --> 09:45.427
There's a camera mounted to that damn thing.

09:45.485 --> 09:48.193
No, relax. They're around here all
the time for the oil companies.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.325
- They saw me.
- No, no, no.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.435
Get that film.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.863
Kowal Air Service.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.538
Good night, sweetheart.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.806
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

10:01.868 --> 10:04.144
- That sounds great.
- See you tomorrow.

10:06.372 --> 10:07.817
Take care.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.507
There isn't a whole lot, but you're
welcome to whatever you want.

10:34.534 --> 10:35.911
What were you doing out there?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.004
Where?

10:46.379 --> 10:47.949
- Let's see the film.
- What film?

10:59.459 --> 11:01.598
What the hell did you do?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.368
I hit him.

11:03.429 --> 11:07.571
You broke his neck. Now if we don't
find that film, we're dead, too.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.133
Hey, hey, you can't go in there.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.270
Oh, we’re friends of his.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.541
We just did a job for Sam yesterday.

11:43.603 --> 11:46.140
We wanted to find out what happened. Come on.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.879
Yeah, you still can't go in there.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.784
Well, who do we talk to?

11:50.343 --> 11:52.516
Detective Sergeant Brannen.

11:53.179 --> 11:54.658
Thanks.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.192
Excuse me. Which one of you fellows
is Detective Sergeant Brannen?

12:03.590 --> 12:04.933
I am.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.633
Do you have an interest here?

12:11.231 --> 12:16.237
Well, we worked with this guy
or we did work with him.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.114
You were his employees?

12:18.838 --> 12:21.944
Not exactly, we just kind of filled in.

12:22.609 --> 12:23.917
We flew for him.

12:23.977 --> 12:27.322
Like, you know, shuttle
passengers, do film survey work.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.552
Well, I got the same kind of
operation right down the runway here.

12:30.617 --> 12:31.789
And you are?

12:31.851 --> 12:33.831
Dominic Santini.

12:34.153 --> 12:36.190
S-A-N-T-I-N-I.

12:36.689 --> 12:37.827
Thank you.

12:39.158 --> 12:41.195
Stringfellow Hawke.

12:47.700 --> 12:51.477
Do either of you have any idea who might
want to do something like this to him?

12:52.138 --> 12:54.982
Nobody that we know of. Sam had no enemies.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.281
Great.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.753
Listen, do you got a hunch?

12:57.810 --> 12:58.845
No, I don't.

12:58.911 --> 13:00.219
Will you try?

13:01.214 --> 13:03.353
Junkies, looking for bread for another pop.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.020
Somebody came by. They got scared.

13:05.084 --> 13:07.963
Are you just saying that
Sam was a random target?

13:08.454 --> 13:10.627
There's an awful lot of that
going around these days.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.135
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

13:12.191 --> 13:13.465
I mean, look at this place.

13:13.926 --> 13:16.167
Hell, what would they think he had in there?

13:17.397 --> 13:19.707
Have you ever seen a rational junkie?

13:21.134 --> 13:24.172
Sam Kowal, victim of a sick society.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.544
Write it off, huh, Detective?

13:27.874 --> 13:30.787
You were the ones who said he
didn't have any enemies, not me.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.851
Well, he was divorced 3 times.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.921
And he went bankrupt and his partners got hurt.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.156
And he did play the ponies.

13:42.221 --> 13:45.361
So, he wasn't exactly a
candidate for sainthood.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.304
Well, at least it gives
us something to work on.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.068
I am sorry about your friend.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.340
But from the looks of this,

13:53.900 --> 13:55.140
anybody could have done it.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.612
And that usually means we may never know.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.382
If you come up with anything
else, give me a call.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.803
- Did you kill her, too?
- No, she's still breathing.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.072
Shall I finish her off?

14:28.134 --> 14:30.614
Forget it, we got what we came here for.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.244
We know what lab the film is at. Now, let's go.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.067
Now, that's a nice leg.

14:53.126 --> 14:56.005
Yeah, not bad for an ex-cop from Texas.

14:57.263 --> 14:59.038
Can you remember anything?

14:59.098 --> 15:01.135
Like the shape of a head or skin color,

15:01.200 --> 15:02.941
an item of clothing or smell?

15:03.002 --> 15:04.037
Smell?

15:04.103 --> 15:08.210
Well, like cologne or tobacco or
garlic or oil on their clothes.

15:08.274 --> 15:11.448
It all happened so fast, I really don't
recall much of anything about it.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.956
I've had better victims.

15:13.012 --> 15:17.427
Oh, no, I heard someone mention
pictures. No, no, no, no, no, film.

15:17.483 --> 15:20.293
- You sure?
- Yes, I heard one mention film.

15:20.386 --> 15:21.364
Film?

15:21.421 --> 15:24.766
Don't take the film, take the film,

15:24.824 --> 15:27.532
can we peddle this film, look
at all this damn film, what?

15:27.593 --> 15:29.004
I don't know.

15:29.629 --> 15:33.406
All I remember thinking is I'm not
gonna buy it in a helicopter crash

15:33.466 --> 15:35.070
like my Mom always said I would.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.080
I was gonna die right now.

15:37.603 --> 15:38.809
Then I passed out.

15:40.006 --> 15:42.247
Well, I'll get back to you.

15:42.842 --> 15:46.085
Yeah sure, the check's in the mail, too.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.622
Given the facts that I don't have in this case,

15:51.684 --> 15:53.220
I'm afraid I can't exactly tell you

15:53.286 --> 15:55.129
that it's a top priority assignment.

15:55.588 --> 15:56.828
Listen.

15:58.224 --> 16:01.171
One friend is dead, the
other is in the hospital.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.207
What do we have to do
to keep you on this case?

16:03.262 --> 16:06.072
Look, Mr. Hawke, last night
in this precinct alone,

16:06.132 --> 16:07.475
there were 10 break-ins,

16:07.533 --> 16:09.979
3 assaults, a murder and a suicide.

16:10.036 --> 16:14.212
Now, I'm keeping on all of those
cases, so you get off of mine.

16:14.273 --> 16:15.547
Get some help.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.110
Tell the Mayor.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.320
Cool lady.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.792
Yeah, just what we need.

16:25.117 --> 16:26.494
I like her style.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.576
I said the wrong thing?

16:39.632 --> 16:42.044
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16:42.101 --> 16:44.172
It's just that Sam wanted to sell out

16:44.237 --> 16:46.308
a couple of months ago and drift.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.784
And String, like the good friend,

16:48.908 --> 16:50.854
sat him down and told him to shape up.

16:51.143 --> 16:53.680
And that's why he stayed, to work it out.

16:56.048 --> 16:57.459
I said the wrong thing.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.474
So, what are we doin’ here?

17:46.799 --> 17:48.506
Visiting, I suppose.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.078
You know, somebody's gonna come along

17:52.138 --> 17:54.015
and haul this junk away someday.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.444
And that's

17:57.109 --> 17:59.988
the last you're ever gonna hear of Sam Kowal.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.683
I never could figure you and Sam as friends.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.850
He was such a slob about his life.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.657
And, you know, he was like a gypsy.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.724
He was all over the map, may he rest in peace.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.862
But you, you're so much the other way.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.172
Maybe I thought he'd teach me something.

18:18.230 --> 18:21.302
Yeah well, look, what's done is done.

18:22.301 --> 18:23.302
Come on, let's go.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.042
The cops have been over
this place a dozen times.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.880
You know, that lady cop's theory
about the junkie thieves,

18:27.940 --> 18:28.975
that didn't wash.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.214
There's $10,000 worth of camera equipment.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.223
They didn't paint up or graffiti the walls.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.190
They didn't cut up the furniture, they just…

18:37.216 --> 18:38.593
Hello, is anybody there?

18:38.651 --> 18:39.994
Get the light.

18:50.229 --> 18:51.299
What do you want?

18:53.499 --> 18:55.274
To deliver this.

18:56.769 --> 18:59.943
Hey, it's the film we made for Sam.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.789
There's been a lot of
break-ins led by street gangs.

19:08.848 --> 19:12.660
Are you guys kidding? My Mom
wouldn't let me join a book club.

19:15.921 --> 19:18.128
You took long enough to get that film here.

19:18.190 --> 19:22.332
Hey, you're lucky that that
wasn't burned in the fire.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.601
What fire?

19:23.663 --> 19:26.041
The lab, it was torched tonight.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.600
The cops said it was arson.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.119
Here.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.784
This doesn't deserve a funny remark.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.726
You just made one, scram.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.826
And don't slam the door.

19:54.593 --> 19:57.733
Our place gets ripped off
and then that lab burns.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.572
One thing ties all that together.

19:59.899 --> 20:00.900
This film.

20:03.569 --> 20:08.109
Hey, and Caitlin said that the guys
that hit her talked about film.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.172
What happened?

20:30.029 --> 20:32.908
I must have conked out on
about the 33rd run through.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.371
Well, the good guys got the girl.

20:38.637 --> 20:40.446
Oh yeah, sure.

20:41.340 --> 20:44.321
Oh, look at the time. You've
been doing this all night.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.351
Run it through again.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.363
Oh, come on, String.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.921
What do you expect to see?

20:54.987 --> 20:58.264
A neon sign saying,
"The killers went that way"?

20:58.324 --> 21:02.067
I'd a lot rather see an oil company

21:02.128 --> 21:05.166
or industrial espionage, something.

21:05.931 --> 21:09.777
I mean what? That makes Brannen right.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.712
Well, if you're asking me what,

21:13.773 --> 21:16.413
how will you know when you've found it?

21:16.475 --> 21:18.011
I'll know.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.784
Oh sure, you'll know.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.896
I'm off shift and I'm on my own time.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.226
I don't like working at nights

21:28.287 --> 21:30.130
because I usually run into
the same kind of people

21:30.189 --> 21:31.896
that I don't like meeting in the daytime.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.430
So, you guys better have a pretty
good reason for calling me.

21:35.294 --> 21:40.300
How about, we have a film as
the key to Sam Kowal's death.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.774
You don't go in for big surprises, do you?

21:44.670 --> 21:46.616
It's not easy to get your attention.

21:48.207 --> 21:49.709
Is he always this charming?

21:50.442 --> 21:51.921
Only when he tries.

21:54.113 --> 21:57.219
Okay, I'm all eyes. What's this film show?

21:57.283 --> 21:59.388
The desert.

22:00.686 --> 22:01.960
Look,

22:02.488 --> 22:04.126
Sam was killed

22:04.623 --> 22:06.762
because somebody thought
that he was in the chopper

22:06.826 --> 22:09.602
that was taking this film of a certain area.

22:10.763 --> 22:11.901
But it wasn't Sam.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.203
What do you mean, "It wasn't Sam"?

22:15.868 --> 22:17.848
It was us. We shot that film.

22:17.903 --> 22:20.008
This is where I came in.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.951
Enjoy the popcorn. Good night.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.988
I'll turn out the lights.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.370
So far, all I see is a lot of desert.

22:52.605 --> 22:53.675
Pay attention.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.644
We're get’n to the good part.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.221
Girls in bathing suits?

23:07.186 --> 23:10.190
Well, spent worse nights with men.
Don't ask me when, though.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.963
I still think that film's important.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.697
For sentimental reasons.

23:14.894 --> 23:18.307
Look, you and I got along just
fine for the last couple of hours.

23:18.364 --> 23:20.207
I kind of liked it that way.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.171
Well, then maybe you can see what I see.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.407
I do see what you see.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.177
Don't you understand? That's the point.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.741
I see a lot of desert, I see rocks, I see sand.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.548
I see girls in bathing suits.

23:33.345 --> 23:35.689
Sam's killer is out there somewhere.

23:37.683 --> 23:41.096
I wish he was. For your sake, I wish he was.

23:47.626 --> 23:48.798
Hey.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.876
I thought if I watched it 3 dozen times

23:52.932 --> 23:54.605
you might buy me breakfast.

23:59.505 --> 24:02.349
We can provide cover for
vehicles here, in the woods.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.478
Some are coming by car.

24:04.543 --> 24:05.647
How many by air?

24:05.711 --> 24:07.315
All the Chicago people.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.757
Shaughnessey, Lucas, most of the Western crowd.

24:09.815 --> 24:12.022
I want them treated like royalty.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.495
I want them…

24:13.552 --> 24:15.293
Thank you.

24:15.988 --> 24:19.094
I want them to know it's more than money.

24:19.858 --> 24:23.237
But let's not kid each other.
They're not all friends.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.435
Well, I think those helicopters
of yours will keep them honest.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.804
It's going to be a sweet
reunion after all these years.

24:34.673 --> 24:36.482
You know the old joke.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.249
We were so poor we had to go upstairs

24:38.310 --> 24:40.256
to answer the phone in the hall.

24:40.946 --> 24:44.758
Then my Father got hurt on a part-time
job and we didn't even have that.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.228
So, we came west.

24:46.952 --> 24:50.024
We lived in a tin shack right
on the edge of the desert.

24:50.756 --> 24:53.635
You could fry eggs on
our roof most of the year.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.296
That was when we had eggs.

24:56.028 --> 24:58.406
And then at night, we just froze.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.572
You can't believe how cold it gets out there.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.272
Do you know my Father was still
insisting on his deathbed

25:05.337 --> 25:08.181
that he could get back up on his
feet without anybody else's help.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.281
How old were you?

25:11.276 --> 25:12.755
When Daddy died?

25:14.113 --> 25:15.683
14 years old.

25:17.983 --> 25:19.621
You still have your people?

25:21.453 --> 25:25.959
No. They were lost in a boating
accident when I was about 10.

25:27.626 --> 25:30.573
Well, Dominic raised me like a Father.

25:31.597 --> 25:33.201
Are you angry, too?

25:34.633 --> 25:36.010
At who?

25:37.936 --> 25:39.347
At your parents

25:41.407 --> 25:43.148
for leaving you so soon.

25:53.819 --> 25:54.957
Listen to us.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.300
It beats scrapping at each other.

26:05.964 --> 26:08.171
Well, how do you do, Stringfellow Hawke?

26:08.634 --> 26:10.375
It's nice to finally meet you.

26:11.336 --> 26:12.508
At last.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.184
Can you wait a minute for breakfast?

26:20.245 --> 26:22.282
I really think I should stop up here.

26:22.347 --> 26:23.655
Go ahead.

26:41.166 --> 26:43.772
Hey Charlie, need a good cop?

26:43.836 --> 26:45.179
Yeah, better take a look.

26:45.237 --> 26:48.116
The old man's dog was looking
around after a jackrabbit.

26:49.374 --> 26:50.682
Who was it?

26:50.742 --> 26:52.050
Harmless old lady.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.182
Looked for rocks. Lived in her own world.

27:03.589 --> 27:05.296
What is it?

27:05.357 --> 27:08.531
Pot-heads, huh? You think junkies did this?

27:09.528 --> 27:11.769
Hawke, the old lady's car crashed and burned.

27:11.830 --> 27:14.037
Now you can't make anything out of that.

27:14.099 --> 27:16.272
This vehicle was hit by rocket fire.

27:17.002 --> 27:19.380
Don't you think that's a slight overkill?

27:20.873 --> 27:22.875
Well, I've seen enough of it to know.

27:26.578 --> 27:28.353
Charlie, are there any next of kin?

27:28.413 --> 27:29.653
Sorry, none that we know of.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.559
Well, will you keep trying to locate
some, see if she has any family?

27:32.618 --> 27:33.619
Sure will.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.329
Are you okay?

27:46.932 --> 27:50.038
Sam was killed 'cause they
thought he was in that chopper

27:50.102 --> 27:51.513
when we flew over this area.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.106
They thought he took pictures

27:53.172 --> 27:56.483
of something he wasn't supposed
to see in this desert.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.249
We don't know that.

27:58.310 --> 28:01.223
Well, then what did this old lady
bump into that cost her her life?

28:01.280 --> 28:03.317
Oh, come on, Hawke. That's
a pretty big stretch

28:03.382 --> 28:06.158
to try and connect 2
completely isolated incidents.

28:09.888 --> 28:11.424
Come on, let's go.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.281
A little service here. A little service.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.882
Hey, Dom, how's it goin’?

28:35.948 --> 28:38.087
Yeah, it's goin’. You?

28:38.150 --> 28:40.790
Can't complain. You wanna menu?

28:40.852 --> 28:43.128
No, I don't wanna menu. I wanna sandwich.

28:43.188 --> 28:44.394
What kind?

28:45.991 --> 28:47.902
Salami cotto and provolone.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.064
Italian bread?

28:49.127 --> 28:51.573
What else? And throw in a
few French fries, will you?

28:52.998 --> 28:55.501
Willis, what's that smoke over at Santini's?

28:57.669 --> 28:59.046
Call in a fire.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.520
Here you go. Salami and cheese.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.815
No plate.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.888
Hey Dom, your hanger's on fire.

29:08.947 --> 29:10.255
No mustard.

29:17.522 --> 29:20.093
Dominic, no, no, no. You can't go in there.

29:20.158 --> 29:22.069
My helicopters!

29:49.221 --> 29:50.723
Well, they got the film.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.525
You don't give up, do you?

29:54.126 --> 29:56.231
What, you think this fire's a coincidence?

29:56.695 --> 30:00.040
Mr. Santini, what did the investigator say?

30:00.098 --> 30:02.977
They don't know what
started it. Maybe it was me.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.571
Oh come on, Dom.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.877
Oh, I tell you, I don't remember.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.851
See, I was making coffee. And then I…

30:11.243 --> 30:14.656
I was usin’ solvent on machine
parts, maybe that did it.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.750
That's not what happened.

30:16.815 --> 30:17.987
All right.

30:18.050 --> 30:21.293
Look, the department investigated Sam Kowal.

30:21.353 --> 30:22.627
They got nothing but dead ends

30:22.688 --> 30:25.965
with his ex-wives, his
ex-partners and his ex-bookies.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.163
Why are you so convinced…

30:28.226 --> 30:30.001
Somebody wanted it bad enough.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.598
To kill?

30:31.663 --> 30:32.869
Twice.

30:34.900 --> 30:37.380
Okay, who are our suspects here?

30:37.436 --> 30:39.416
How many people knew about the film?

30:40.105 --> 30:41.709
Well, me and String knew.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.150
And me, that's 3.

30:43.208 --> 30:45.154
And Caitlin, oh, and the lab people.

30:45.210 --> 30:46.621
And the delivery boy.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.817
- That's it.
- There are always more.

30:48.880 --> 30:53.727
I told Everett and a couple of
guys over at the coffee wagon.

30:53.785 --> 30:55.196
I told them.

30:55.253 --> 30:57.927
And more and more and more.

30:58.890 --> 31:01.234
Don't worry Hawke, we'll keep trying.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.162
We'll stay on it.

31:09.301 --> 31:10.974
Thanks for breakfast.

31:17.976 --> 31:19.580
Come on, let's go for a drive.

32:17.536 --> 32:18.981
String?

32:21.473 --> 32:24.454
What makes you think that
whatever is down there

32:24.509 --> 32:29.424
will be so accommodating as to
let us photograph it, twice?

32:29.481 --> 32:30.960
Just a hunch.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.798
Well, what do you see?

32:45.864 --> 32:46.865
Noth’n.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.108
Hold it.

32:52.137 --> 32:54.139
Right there at the intersection.

32:58.143 --> 32:59.622
I don't know.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.288
Several men.

33:02.614 --> 33:05.254
Big, expensive cars. Looks like some kind of

33:06.017 --> 33:08.623
a big-time gathering of people for some reason.

33:08.687 --> 33:09.757
Let's make another hard print.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.893
This time plus 8 magnifications of that area.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.611
Well, use the magnifying glass.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.315
Well, I'll be damned.

33:29.374 --> 33:30.375
What? What?

33:30.575 --> 33:31.553
That's it.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.789
What? What?

33:41.753 --> 33:43.096
Detective Brannen.

33:43.154 --> 33:45.828
Yeah, this is Hawke, we got him.

33:45.891 --> 33:48.770
Well, hello to you, too.

33:48.827 --> 33:51.740
Does the name Kenneth Langhorn
mean anything to you?

33:51.830 --> 33:53.605
He disappeared.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.076
Yeah, we found him.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.669
What are you talking about?

33:57.335 --> 33:59.212
Well, we've got film proof.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.612
Kenneth Langhorn in living color.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.514
Where are you right now?

34:05.577 --> 34:08.319
I'm at my cabin, but I'll meet
you back at the airfield.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.885
I think I better talk to my Captain.

34:12.751 --> 34:15.493
Keep a tight lid on this until
I get back to you, okay?

34:15.554 --> 34:16.692
You got it.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.030
You must be a millionaire by now.

34:19.090 --> 34:22.833
No objections. When I get good
service, I'm happy to pay the tab.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.033
And you have been a lot of
help from time to time.

34:26.097 --> 34:28.804
Where does it go, Swiss bank account?

34:28.867 --> 34:33.179
Or do they make safe deposit
boxes big enough to hold it all?

34:33.237 --> 34:36.014
You're a fascinating woman, I must tell you.

34:38.842 --> 34:40.982
That's not for sale.

35:02.667 --> 35:05.079
And you Kenneth, it's like
you're back from the dead.

35:05.136 --> 35:06.911
Kenneth, it's been a long time.

35:06.972 --> 35:08.679
It's good to be back.

35:09.407 --> 35:14.755
Gentlemen, we are about to
divide up the United States.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.671
This far enough out for ya?

35:33.732 --> 35:35.871
I know, I'm sorry.

35:35.934 --> 35:39.973
Captain wanted to meet you away
from the station and this is…

35:40.038 --> 35:42.644
This is away, I can tell.

35:42.707 --> 35:44.812
Well, the syndicate has
a very long reach, you know.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.685
Even into our little department.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.554
Yeah, I read the papers.

35:48.613 --> 35:52.151
Okay, fine. How about better too
careful than not careful enough?

35:52.784 --> 35:54.263
You sure are nervous.

35:56.087 --> 35:57.828
This is a major situation.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.473
Your hands are awful cold, too.

36:14.439 --> 36:15.918
Just like my heart.

36:16.041 --> 36:17.782
I'm a tough cookie, just like you are.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.014
Yeah, I was a little tough on ya

36:21.079 --> 36:23.081
when I first met ya, I apologize.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.918
That's okay, it was my fault.

36:26.985 --> 36:30.091
I didn't realize that Sam Kowal
and you were such good friends.

36:41.599 --> 36:43.203
Guess that'd be your Captain.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.076
What's the matter?

36:49.808 --> 36:54.518
It's just that I had an awful lot of
things I really wanted to say to you.

36:58.717 --> 36:59.889
Why?

37:01.019 --> 37:02.259
I'm sorry.

37:03.288 --> 37:06.735
Why would you sell your soul
to an animal like Langhorn?

37:06.791 --> 37:10.830
Because once you've been cold,
you don't ever get warm.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.840
God help me.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.974
We'll take over from here.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.778
No, that's not the plan.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.477
You take the film.

37:22.540 --> 37:25.316
I'll keep him here until it's too
late for him to stop that meeting.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.913
Langhorn changed his mind.

37:34.519 --> 37:36.795
Come on, let's go. Get in the car.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.302
Let's go. Let's get him.

37:51.369 --> 37:54.111
Dominic, come in. Come in, Dom.

38:00.178 --> 38:03.182
Get out here as fast as you can. We were right.

38:03.248 --> 38:04.852
We're on our way, String.

38:04.916 --> 38:05.986
Turbos.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.393
Turbos.

38:18.363 --> 38:21.071
You knew, knew all along.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.273
And I was praying I was wrong.

38:25.236 --> 38:26.476
How?

38:26.538 --> 38:30.350
That fire, those hoods hitting Santini Air

38:30.408 --> 38:33.582
when I showed you the film,
everything just pointed to you.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.215
I just didn't wanna believe it.

39:08.646 --> 39:10.683
Give me guns and rockets.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.689
Brannen!

39:48.586 --> 39:50.896
Langhorn is leaving.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.127
The hell with Langhorn.

39:52.190 --> 39:56.297
He's leaving the country today.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.668
In the salt flats airstrip.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.939
I don't care. I'm gonna get
you to a doctor. You hang on.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.446
No.

40:09.507 --> 40:11.282
I'm sorry.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.990
Oh God, I'm sorry.

40:18.182 --> 40:20.162
It all could've been so different.

40:47.245 --> 40:49.020
I thought we had an agreement.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.959
We did. Only we're gonna make it better.

40:52.016 --> 40:55.225
Fellas, I came back into the country

40:55.286 --> 40:57.527
so I could repay you for
covering my disappearance

40:57.588 --> 40:59.431
and so we could cement a new deal.

40:59.490 --> 41:02.164
Well, we don't think you
can handle it without us.

41:02.226 --> 41:03.330
What do you want?

41:03.394 --> 41:04.395
All of it.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.170
We own it all,

41:07.231 --> 41:09.177
every state, every racket.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.041
You run it for us.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.945
I work for you?

41:15.006 --> 41:16.110
Like that.

41:16.808 --> 41:17.980
Okay.

41:19.277 --> 41:21.052
You're not upset?

41:21.112 --> 41:24.787
Leon, this meeting is in
the spirit of cooperation.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.554
I can't say it was unexpected.

41:27.618 --> 41:28.926
Where are you going?

41:29.554 --> 41:31.864
We need something to write an agreement on.

41:31.956 --> 41:34.562
Hey, don't you trust us?

42:08.092 --> 42:11.130
Now, I trust everybody.

42:41.926 --> 42:43.735
My God.

42:43.795 --> 42:46.742
It's the St. Valentines Day
massacre all over again.

42:48.566 --> 42:52.036
Hey, I got some bogies on the
screen, maybe 3 miles out.

42:52.470 --> 42:54.313
Maybe? Hit the ID button.

42:54.372 --> 42:55.942
Yes sir, identify.

43:06.217 --> 43:08.754
Well they're helicopters, but
they're more like gunships.

43:08.820 --> 43:10.424
These guys are armed to the teeth.

43:10.488 --> 43:12.593
Covering Langhorn's exit. Turbos.

43:13.057 --> 43:14.536
Turbos.

43:36.781 --> 43:38.988
Radio one of our ships to knock it down

43:39.050 --> 43:41.553
and get me to the airstrip, fast!

44:32.503 --> 44:34.244
Get him. Get him.

46:24.015 --> 46:26.962
Hawke, listen, I didn't want
to bring this up before, but

46:27.018 --> 46:29.259
what did you end up
telling those investigators?

46:30.588 --> 46:34.559
Well, I just said that Detective
Sergeant Brannen was out there with

46:35.960 --> 46:38.839
Langhorn under surveillance.
She did it by the book.

46:39.897 --> 46:41.570
And I let it go at that.

46:45.536 --> 46:47.482
You're a good guy, Stringfellow Hawke.

46:51.642 --> 46:52.882
Well, don't let it let around, huh?
