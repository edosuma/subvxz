06:11.267 --> 06:13.267
JUST MOVE ON.

06:13.267 --> 06:14.067
[clicks tongue]

06:14.067 --> 06:17.067
[stammers and groans]

06:25.633 --> 06:26.633
HEY.

06:26.633 --> 06:28.633
WHAT UP?

06:28.633 --> 06:31.400
WHAT ARE WE HAVING?

06:31.400 --> 06:33.167
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD SPARE

06:33.167 --> 06:34.967
ME A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR TIME

06:34.967 --> 06:36.400
BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.733
OF COURSE.

06:37.733 --> 06:39.267
WHY YOU SAY "SPARE"?

06:39.267 --> 06:41.067
THAT'S NORMAL.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.233
WELL, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

06:42.233 --> 06:43.367
I MEAN, LATELY WE AIN'T BEEN

06:43.367 --> 06:44.333
IN A GOOD PLACE.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.167
JUST KEEPING IT REAL, YOU KNOW?

06:46.167 --> 06:47.167
I'M GLAD RASHEEDA SAID

06:47.167 --> 06:48.300
SOMETHING TO ME 'CAUSE WE REALLY

06:48.300 --> 06:49.367
HAVEN'T HAD A MINUTE TO LAY

06:49.367 --> 06:50.533
EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE.

06:50.533 --> 06:51.567
I'VE BEEN TRYING NOT TO EVEN

06:51.567 --> 06:52.600
BUMP HEADS WITH HER, JUST STAY

06:52.600 --> 06:53.967
AWAY, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SHE'S

06:53.967 --> 06:55.067
DOING SOMETHING THAT I'M NOT

06:55.067 --> 06:56.467
INTO RIGHT NOW.

06:56.467 --> 06:58.067
I DON'T FEEL LIKE GETTING TO

06:58.067 --> 06:59.200
A PLACE WHERE I DON'T WANT TO

06:59.200 --> 07:00.233
BE AROUND.

07:00.233 --> 07:00.900
I DON'T KNOW.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.400
I'D RATHER GO RIDE A BIKE

07:02.400 --> 07:03.667
OR FIND SPACE.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.133
WE GOT TO BE AROUND EACH OTHER,

07:05.133 --> 07:06.500
BUT SOMETIME I BE LIKE, "WHAT,

07:06.500 --> 07:10.200
DO WE NEED TO TAKE A BREAK

07:10.200 --> 07:12.200
AND GO LEFT AND SIT DOWN AND

07:12.200 --> 07:14.067
FIGURE OUT PEACE AMONGST

07:14.067 --> 07:14.700
ONE ANOTHER?"

07:14.700 --> 07:16.167
IS THAT YOU FEELING LIKE?

07:16.167 --> 07:16.933
YOU FEELING LIKE YOU WANT TO

07:16.933 --> 07:18.400
TAKE A BREAK?

07:18.400 --> 07:19.433
'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW YOU REALLY,

07:19.433 --> 07:21.567
LIKE, TAKE BREAKS IN A MARRIAGE.

07:21.567 --> 07:24.067
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE IT'S LIKE--

07:24.067 --> 07:25.300
YOU WORK YOUR [bleep] OUT.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.133
KIRK AND I HAVE REAL ISSUES,

07:27.133 --> 07:27.867
FROM HIS BROTHER'S HEART

07:27.867 --> 07:29.833
TRANSPLANT TO HIS SON'S LEGAL

07:29.833 --> 07:31.567
ISSUES, BUT LET'S DEAL WITH IT

07:31.567 --> 07:32.833
INSTEAD OF RUNNING FROM IT.

07:32.833 --> 07:34.233
I ALREADY OFFERED A SOLUTION:

07:34.233 --> 07:35.267
MY JEWELRY LINE, WHICH IS

07:35.267 --> 07:36.867
A SLAM DUNK MONEYMAKER.

07:36.867 --> 07:38.267
WITH THE STORE SITUATION, I LOOK

07:38.267 --> 07:40.067
AT LIKE, YOU KNOW, AT FIRST,

07:40.067 --> 07:41.567
YOU'RE LIKE, "YES, RASHEEDA,

07:41.567 --> 07:43.167
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS."

07:43.167 --> 07:43.967
AND LIKE I SAID, I KNOW

07:43.967 --> 07:44.633
[bleep] HAPPENED--

07:44.633 --> 07:46.167
WHAT PART ABOUT BAD TIMING

07:46.167 --> 07:47.933
IS NOT SAYING NO?

07:47.933 --> 07:50.100
I'M TELLING YOU IT'S BAD TIMING.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.800
IT'S TOO MUCH ON OUR PLATE.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.500
THAT IS NOT GONNA FLY RIGHT NOW.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.367
TO ME, YOU'RE NOT BEING

07:54.367 --> 07:55.300
A TEAM PLAYER.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.267
YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT...

07:56.267 --> 07:56.933
AND I FEEL LIKE--

07:56.933 --> 07:57.933
THINGS YOU WANT, AND IT'S

07:57.933 --> 07:59.133
REALLY--AND IT IRRITATES

07:59.133 --> 08:02.633
THE [bleep] OUT OF ME.

08:02.633 --> 08:03.433
WHERE DO WE GO?

08:03.433 --> 08:04.900
LIKE, WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO?

08:04.900 --> 08:06.067
I WANT US TO TRY TO GET TO

08:06.067 --> 08:07.233
SOME KIND OF PLACE, BECAUSE WE

08:07.233 --> 08:08.433
GONNA HAVE SOME OTHER TYPE OF

08:08.433 --> 08:12.500
RESPONSIBILITIES GOING ON.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.667
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY WHY

08:13.667 --> 08:15.933
I SAID "NO STORE RIGHT NOW."

08:15.933 --> 08:17.067
THE TIMING AIN'T RIGHT.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.100
YOU DON'T NEED MORE.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.100
WELL, TIMING IS--

08:19.100 --> 08:20.067
[laughs]

08:20.067 --> 08:22.567
TIMING IS NEVER RIGHT,

08:22.567 --> 08:24.367
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

08:24.367 --> 08:27.133
I--

08:27.133 --> 08:30.233
I WENT TO THE DOCTOR YESTERDAY,

08:30.233 --> 08:33.067
AND...

08:33.067 --> 08:35.067
I'M PREGNANT.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.167
YOU JUSTIFY EVERYTHING THAT YOU

08:39.167 --> 08:41.367
SAY AND DO, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO

08:41.367 --> 08:43.067
ME, IT'S ALWAYS FINGER-POINTING.

08:43.067 --> 08:45.100
AM I PREGNANT?

08:45.100 --> 08:46.333
YOU DON'T GOT TO BE ALL IN

08:46.333 --> 08:47.067
MY BUSINESS.

08:47.067 --> 08:48.067
I JUST HAVE TO DO YOU LIKE MY

08:48.067 --> 08:50.567
MAMA DID ME: STEP THE HELL BACK,

08:50.567 --> 08:52.167
AND WHEN YOU FALL, I CAN'T PICK

08:52.167 --> 08:52.833
YOU UP.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.067
EVERY TIME I HAVE A [bleep]

08:54.067 --> 08:55.133
SCENE, IT'S GOT TO BE RUINED BY

08:55.133 --> 08:56.500
SOME BULL[bleep].

08:56.500 --> 08:57.300
I'M NOT THE ONE THAT'S

08:57.300 --> 08:58.467
[bleep] DOING NOTHING WRONG

08:58.467 --> 09:00.533
RIGHT NOW.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.133
THAT'S CRAZY.

09:09.133 --> 09:10.067
I DON'T THINK THE TIMING'S

09:10.067 --> 09:11.133
RIGHT.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.067
I'M JUST GONNA TELL YOU

09:12.067 --> 09:12.700
THAT NOW.

09:12.700 --> 09:13.533
OKAY, SO WITH YOU TELLING ME

09:13.533 --> 09:14.367
YOU DON'T THINK THE TIMING'S

09:14.367 --> 09:15.100
RIGHT, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING

09:15.100 --> 09:15.800
TO ME?

09:15.800 --> 09:16.800
I DON'T KNOW.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.067
THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH ALREADY

09:18.067 --> 09:20.067
GOING ON.

09:22.867 --> 09:23.867
BUT I FEEL LIKE OF ALL

09:23.867 --> 09:25.267
THE TIMES OF YOU TALKING TO ME,

09:25.267 --> 09:26.167
SAYING THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

09:26.167 --> 09:29.633
THAT YOU WANT, AND THEN EVEN

09:29.633 --> 09:30.900
THOUGH, YES, WE GOING THROUGH

09:30.900 --> 09:32.200
A LITTLE BUMP IN THE ROAD--

09:32.200 --> 09:33.767
THAT HAPPENS IN PEOPLE LIFE.

09:33.767 --> 09:34.833
I TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT

09:34.833 --> 09:36.700
THE LORD IS BLESSING US WITH,

09:36.700 --> 09:38.900
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME, "OH,

09:38.900 --> 09:40.067
THE TIMING AIN'T GOOD."

09:40.067 --> 09:41.533
IS THE TIMING EVER GOOD?

09:41.533 --> 09:43.067
BUT THE BEAUTIFUL PART ABOUT IT

09:43.067 --> 09:44.500
IS, WE'LL HAVE A CHILD THAT WE

09:44.500 --> 09:46.067
ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT WE WANTED

09:46.067 --> 09:48.167
ANOTHER KID.

09:48.167 --> 09:50.300
AND KY IS 12 ALREADY.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.733
YES, AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD

09:51.733 --> 09:53.333
TO HIM GETTING 18 AND BE ABLE TO

09:53.333 --> 09:54.567
LEAVE OUT OF TOWN AND DON'T HAVE

09:54.567 --> 09:55.800
TO RUSH BACK HOME.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.900
I'M READY TO HAVE A BREAK.

09:57.900 --> 10:00.033
WELL, I APOLOGIZE THAT ME AND

10:00.033 --> 10:01.400
ME HAVING A BABY'S NOT A PART

10:01.400 --> 10:02.867
OF YOUR LIFE PLAN.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.267
THIS IS THE SAME MAN WHO TOLD ME

10:04.267 --> 10:06.200
A YEAR AGO NOT TO SACRIFICE MY

10:06.200 --> 10:07.600
FAMILY FOR A CAREER.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.467
I GUESS THAT WAS A BUNCH OF

10:08.467 --> 10:10.400
[bleep], AND BESIDES, KIRK AND I

10:10.400 --> 10:11.667
HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.000
WHEN WE HAD OUR SON, KY, I WAS

10:13.000 --> 10:14.400
TOURING AND DOING EVERYTHING

10:14.400 --> 10:15.500
I NEEDED TO DO DURING MY

10:15.500 --> 10:16.900
PREGNANCY, BUT THIS [bleep]

10:16.900 --> 10:18.233
RIGHT HERE IS [bleep].

10:18.233 --> 10:19.267
I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING THAT

10:19.267 --> 10:20.300
NEED TO BE DONE, AND WHEN--

10:20.300 --> 10:21.567
AND AFTER I HAD A BABY, YOU KNOW

10:21.567 --> 10:23.000
EVERYTHING WILL BE LINED UP--

10:23.000 --> 10:24.200
THAT'S YOUR FAULT, THOUGH.

10:24.200 --> 10:24.933
I TOLD YOU.

10:24.933 --> 10:25.800
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD YOU.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.633
WHAT YOU MEAN IT'S MY FAULT?

10:26.633 --> 10:27.333
'CAUSE I TOLD YOU, YOU

10:27.333 --> 10:28.067
SHOULD'VE KEPT TAKING

10:28.067 --> 10:30.033
YOUR PILLS.

10:30.033 --> 10:30.967
DON'T ACT LIKE I DON'T TAKE

10:30.967 --> 10:31.833
BREAKS SOMETIME.

10:31.833 --> 10:32.667
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN TAKING THEM

10:32.667 --> 10:35.000
[bleep] SINCE A TEENAGER.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.867
YOU JUSTIFY EVERYTHING THAT YOU

10:36.867 --> 10:39.033
SAY AND DO, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO

10:39.033 --> 10:40.733
ME, IT'S ALWAYS FINGER-POINTING.

10:40.733 --> 10:43.300
AM I PREGNANT?

10:43.300 --> 10:44.200
DID I TELL YOU TO STOP

10:44.200 --> 10:45.533
TAKING PILLS?

10:45.533 --> 10:46.767
YOU DID NOT TELL ME, BUT

10:46.767 --> 10:47.767
DON'T ACT LIKE YOU--

10:47.767 --> 10:49.733
OH, BUT YOU WEREN'T ACTING LIKE

10:49.733 --> 10:51.433
YOU CARED.

10:51.433 --> 10:52.167
WELL, WHAT MAKES YOU

10:52.167 --> 10:53.033
SAY THAT?

10:53.033 --> 10:54.100
I MEAN--I MEAN, WE WAS HAVING

10:54.100 --> 10:54.767
SEX JUST, LIKE--

10:54.767 --> 10:55.500
CONDOMS.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.367
OKAY, AND SEVERAL TIMES

10:57.367 --> 10:58.567
WITHOUT THEM.

10:58.567 --> 10:59.233
AND NOT--

10:59.233 --> 11:00.300
SO THAT'S--THAT CAN HAPPEN.

11:00.300 --> 11:01.333
AND NOT DOING IT, LIKE--

11:01.333 --> 11:02.367
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

11:02.367 --> 11:04.600
LIKE, OUT AIN'T IN YOU.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.400
THAT SOUNDS CRAZY.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.100
JUST BECAUSE YOU PULL OUT DON'T

11:08.100 --> 11:10.467
MEAN A WOMAN CAN'T GET PREGNANT.

11:10.467 --> 11:12.133
YOU LEARNED THAT [bleep] IN DAMN

11:12.133 --> 11:13.200
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.967
RASHEEDA TOLD ME A YEAR AGO

11:14.967 --> 11:15.900
SHE WASN'T READY TO HAVE

11:15.900 --> 11:16.733
A CHILD, AND SHE TOOK ALL

11:16.733 --> 11:17.867
THE PROPER PRECAUTIONS NOT

11:17.867 --> 11:18.733
TO HAVE ONE.

11:18.733 --> 11:20.400
NOW THIS YEAR, SHE WANTS TO HAVE

11:20.400 --> 11:21.967
ONE, AND I'M TOTALLY NOT READY

11:21.967 --> 11:22.667
FOR ONE.

11:22.667 --> 11:23.867
SO HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO BE DOING

11:23.867 --> 11:25.367
BACKFLIPS RIGHT NOW WHEN I HAVE

11:25.367 --> 11:26.400
A MILLION OTHER THINGS

11:26.400 --> 11:27.167
ON MY MIND?

11:27.167 --> 11:28.267
LIKE, THIS IS NOT JOY.

11:28.267 --> 11:29.233
THIS IS NOT PLEASURE.

11:29.233 --> 11:31.133
THIS IS A SETBACK TO ME.

11:31.133 --> 11:32.900
IF I GOT TO GO THROUGH IT

11:32.900 --> 11:34.767
AND YOU'RE NOT AROUND OR HOWEVER

11:34.767 --> 11:36.833
YOU THINK YOU FEELING, THEN

11:36.833 --> 11:38.833
THAT'S ON YOU.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.067
[sighs]

11:55.733 --> 11:57.367
I WANT SOME OF THAT.

11:57.367 --> 11:58.700
OH, THAT'S A VERY SPECIAL

11:58.700 --> 12:00.067
CAKE, SHAY.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.267
YOU SEE IT SAYS, "E.O.E."

12:02.267 --> 12:03.467
"E.O.E."?

12:03.467 --> 12:06.067
"END OF ENGAGEMENT."

12:06.067 --> 12:08.433
SCRAPPY HAS LEFT THE BAT CAVE.

12:08.433 --> 12:09.433
THAT'S THE REASON MERLOT IS

12:09.433 --> 12:11.167
OVER HERE, BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY

12:11.167 --> 12:12.333
I'M HAVING TO PICK UP AFTER

12:12.333 --> 12:13.467
HIS BEHIND.

12:13.467 --> 12:14.167
YOU THINK IT'S REALLY

12:14.167 --> 12:14.833
OVER, THOUGH?

12:14.833 --> 12:15.533
MM-HMM.

12:15.533 --> 12:16.900
HE BROUGHT HIS CLOTHES OVER.

12:16.900 --> 12:17.800
HE SAID, "MA, I COULDN'T TAKE IT

12:17.800 --> 12:18.567
NO MORE."

12:18.567 --> 12:19.733
WHAT AM I CELEBRATING?

12:19.733 --> 12:21.200
COMING INTO THE CASTLE.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.100
OH, MY GOD.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.100
WHAT YOU GOT UP YOUR SLEEVE?

12:23.100 --> 12:23.767
FOR REAL.

12:23.767 --> 12:24.433
I JUST WANT TO SEE HOW

12:24.433 --> 12:25.100
IT GOES.

12:25.100 --> 12:25.933
YOU ONLY CALLED ME OVER HERE

12:25.933 --> 12:27.267
TO TELL ME THIS?

12:27.267 --> 12:29.067
YEAH, AND--

12:29.067 --> 12:30.233
I KNEW IT WASN'T ANYTHING.

12:30.233 --> 12:31.467
WELL, YOU KNOW, CALLED

12:31.467 --> 12:32.867
SCRAPPY OVER HERE.

12:32.867 --> 12:35.633
I'M--MOMMA DEE.

12:35.633 --> 12:36.467
MY TIME WITH SCRAPPY

12:36.467 --> 12:37.933
IS O.V., HONEY.

12:37.933 --> 12:39.300
THAT IS IN THE PAST.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.467
THAT DUSTY RELATIONSHIP IS

12:40.467 --> 12:41.433
OVER WITH.

12:41.433 --> 12:42.600
FAR AS SITTING ON MOMMA DEE'S

12:42.600 --> 12:44.600
THRONE, I LOVE MOMMA DEE TO

12:44.600 --> 12:45.867
DEATH, BUT I GOT MY OWN THRONE

12:45.867 --> 12:47.067
TO HANDLE.

BE GONE.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.067

12:49.067 --> 12:51.067
OH, GOD.

12:54.667 --> 12:57.100

13:00.267 --> 13:01.333

13:01.333 --> 13:02.933

13:02.933 --> 13:04.067
CELEBRATING.

13:04.067 --> 13:04.867
CELEBRATING WHAT?

13:04.867 --> 13:05.633
WHAT'S THE CAKE FOR?

13:05.633 --> 13:06.767
YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

13:06.767 --> 13:08.600
I SPECIALLY ENGRAVED IT FOR US.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.767
LOOK WHAT IT SAYS.

13:10.767 --> 13:12.167
"E.O.E."

13:12.167 --> 13:13.467
WHAT IS "E.O.E."?

13:13.467 --> 13:15.100
"END OF ENGAGEMENT."

13:15.100 --> 13:16.200
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:16.200 --> 13:17.067
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT WE'LL

13:17.067 --> 13:18.067
JUST CELEBRATE--

13:18.067 --> 13:18.667
FIRST OF ALL--

13:18.667 --> 13:19.767
MAKING A POUND CAKE.

13:19.767 --> 13:21.700
FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS, MA,

13:21.700 --> 13:22.667
I'M TAKING A BREAK

13:22.667 --> 13:25.367
FROM EVERYTHING.

13:25.367 --> 13:26.800
EXCEPT FOR BEING A DADDY.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.600
MM-HMM.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.533
I'M TAKING A BREAK FROM BEING

13:28.533 --> 13:29.633
A SON.

13:29.633 --> 13:31.133
TAKING A BREAK FROM BEING...

13:31.133 --> 13:31.967
OH, YOU CAN NEVER STOP

13:31.967 --> 13:32.633
BEING A SON.

13:32.633 --> 13:33.500
A FIANCE AND ALL THAT.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.067
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS

13:35.067 --> 13:36.567
LADY GOT THIS CAKE AND SHE'S SO

13:36.567 --> 13:38.400
CHEERFUL ABOUT SOMETHING THAT

13:38.400 --> 13:39.700
HURTS IN MY LIFE.

13:39.700 --> 13:40.767
I JUST FEEL LIKE, ONCE AGAIN,

13:40.767 --> 13:41.900
SHE'S JUST WORRIED ABOUT HERSELF

13:41.900 --> 13:43.067
AND HOW SHE FEELS.

13:43.067 --> 13:44.300
YOU AIN'T GOT TO BE ALL IN MY

13:44.300 --> 13:45.167
BUSINESS, YOU KNOW WHAT

13:45.167 --> 13:46.067
I'M SAYING?

13:46.067 --> 13:48.267
THAT'S WHY YOU GOT AWAY.

13:48.267 --> 13:49.067
BUT YOU DO COME TO ME.

13:49.067 --> 13:50.233
I WON'T COME TO YOU NO MORE.

13:50.233 --> 13:51.533
I JUST HAVE TO DO YOU LIKE MY

13:51.533 --> 13:54.067
MAMA DID ME: STEP THE HELL BACK,

13:54.067 --> 13:55.700
AND WHEN YOU FALL, I CAN'T PICK

13:55.700 --> 13:56.600
YOU UP, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:56.600 --> 13:57.267
YOU TURN ON ME.

13:57.267 --> 13:58.067
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT

13:58.067 --> 13:59.067
I'M FOCUSED ON?

13:59.067 --> 14:02.067
MY DAUGHTER AND MY CAREER.

14:02.067 --> 14:02.833
SO WITH THAT BEING SAID,

14:02.833 --> 14:03.633
IF HE WANTS ME TO STAY OUT OF

14:03.633 --> 14:05.700
HIS BUSINESS, I WILL STAY OUT

14:05.700 --> 14:06.600
OF HIS BUSINESS.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.500
YEAH, YOU DEFINITELY--

14:07.500 --> 14:09.367
Y'ALL DO THIS A LOT.

14:09.367 --> 14:11.833
THEY DO THIS ALL THE TIME.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.100
THEY GO AT IT, GO AT IT,

14:13.100 --> 14:14.100
GO AT IT, AND THEN THEY ACT LIKE

14:14.100 --> 14:15.267
NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

14:15.267 --> 14:16.267
SO I WAS JUST SITTING OVER THERE

14:16.267 --> 14:17.400
JUST WAITING FOR IT TO BE

14:17.400 --> 14:18.367
OVER WITH.

14:18.367 --> 14:19.867
I'M NOT YOUR WHAT?

14:19.867 --> 14:20.667
YOU'RE MY SON.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.267
AND WHAT I'M NOT?

14:22.267 --> 14:23.600
I'M NOT YOUR DADDY, AND I'M NOT

14:23.600 --> 14:24.567
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

14:24.567 --> 14:25.400
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY, I'M

14:25.400 --> 14:27.067
STILL YOUR MAMA, AND YOU'RE NOT

14:27.067 --> 14:29.367
THE ONLY CHILD THAT HAS BUCKED

14:29.367 --> 14:31.067
ON THEIR MAMA BECAUSE OF THEIR

14:31.067 --> 14:32.800
LIFE SITUATION,

14:32.800 --> 14:33.900
THEIR LIFE CHOICES.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.267
MA, HERE'S WHAT YOU FAIL

14:35.267 --> 14:36.467
TO REALIZE.

14:36.467 --> 14:37.233
JUST 'CAUSE I DON'T AGREE

14:37.233 --> 14:37.900

14:37.900 --> 14:38.567
I JUST GAVE YOU--

14:42.300 --> 14:43.200
IT'S PROPS WITH A LITTLE

14:43.200 --> 14:44.133
NEGATIVITY IN IT.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.133
YOU FEEL ME?

14:45.133 --> 14:47.067
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

14:47.067 --> 14:48.067

14:48.067 --> 14:48.700
LISTEN.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.700
I'M ME, AND I'MA DO ME.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.800
IF I WANT TO SEE A GIRL

15:01.800 --> 15:02.800

15:02.800 --> 15:04.067

15:08.767 --> 15:09.500

18:09.067 --> 18:09.900
DIFFERENT PAGES.

18:09.900 --> 18:10.867
I KNOW HOW A GUY THINKS.

18:10.867 --> 18:11.933
ONCE A GUY PUTS A PAIR OF SHOES

18:11.933 --> 18:13.433
ON AND GIRL SAYS, "YO, THAT

18:13.433 --> 18:14.700
LOOKS GOOD ON YOU," THEY GONNA

18:14.700 --> 18:16.133
GET IT JUST OFF THE FACT THAT

18:16.133 --> 18:17.433
THE GIRL WAS IN THERE TELLING

18:17.433 --> 18:19.500
HIM IT LOOKED GOOD.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.100
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.200
YOU DID NOT BRING IN GOOD

18:22.200 --> 18:24.067
CANDIDATES WHO COULD REALLY RUN

18:24.067 --> 18:24.833
THIS STORE.

18:24.833 --> 18:26.733
YOU BROUGHT IN HOS!

18:26.733 --> 18:28.167
YOU SHOULD'VE ALREADY KNEW FROM

18:28.167 --> 18:29.100
JUMP WHEN THEY WALKED THROUGH

18:29.100 --> 18:30.333
THE DOOR, "TRACI'S NOT

18:30.333 --> 18:31.233
ACCEPTING THIS.

18:31.233 --> 18:32.100
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO

18:32.100 --> 18:33.433
THE [bleep] HOME."

18:33.433 --> 18:34.367
INSTEAD, YOU'RE SITTING THERE,

18:34.367 --> 18:35.233
CARRYING ON--

18:35.233 --> 18:35.967
[giggles mockingly]

18:35.967 --> 18:37.067
AND LAUGHING IT UP WITH

18:37.067 --> 18:39.267
THESE HOS.

18:39.267 --> 18:40.067
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE'LL DO

18:40.067 --> 18:41.100
THIS OVER.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.733
YOU GONNA CONDUCT THE INTERVIEW.

18:42.733 --> 18:43.633
I NEED THE CHECK.

18:43.633 --> 18:45.600
I NEED THE $25,000 BECAUSE WE

18:45.600 --> 18:46.500
NEED TO GO AHEAD AND DO

18:46.500 --> 18:47.333
THE BUILD OUT OF

18:47.333 --> 18:48.300
THE STORE, SO...

18:48.300 --> 18:49.933
I GOT TO GO.

18:49.933 --> 18:50.633
JUST--

18:50.633 --> 18:52.333
WAIT, HOLD UP.

18:52.333 --> 18:53.167
I NEED AN ANSWER FROM YOU

18:53.167 --> 18:53.833
RIGHT NOW.

18:53.833 --> 18:54.633
LIKE, WHEN I CAN GET THE REST

18:54.633 --> 18:55.300
OF THE MONEY?

18:55.300 --> 18:56.667
YOU GOT TO GIVE ME A MINUTE

18:56.667 --> 18:57.933
TO THINK ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING,

18:57.933 --> 18:59.800
BECAUSE LITERALLY EVERY TIME

18:59.800 --> 19:02.167
I GET AROUND YOU, IT'S ARGUING.

19:02.167 --> 19:03.067
IT'S FIGHTING.

19:03.067 --> 19:03.933
IT'S SOMETHING.

19:03.933 --> 19:05.067
AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU DON'T

19:05.067 --> 19:07.567
KNOW ME AT ALL OR WHAT MAKES ME

19:07.567 --> 19:08.300
GET TO THIS PLACE.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.300
YOU JUST GOT TO RELAX MORE.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.600
JUST--IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.067
LIKE, YOU CALLED THE GIRLS A HO.

19:12.067 --> 19:15.200
THIS IS $25,000 I'M INVESTING

19:15.200 --> 19:16.267
IN THIS BUSINESS.

19:16.267 --> 19:17.267
IT IS THAT SERIOUS.

19:17.267 --> 19:18.100
AND YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THAT

19:18.100 --> 19:19.067
TEN TIMES OVER.

19:19.067 --> 19:20.300
LIKE, IT'S A NO-BRAINER.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.300
I LOOK AT BUSINESS CLEARLY

19:22.300 --> 19:23.467
DIFFERENT FROM YOU.

19:23.467 --> 19:25.700
VIDEO HOS, TO ME, IS NOT A PART

19:25.700 --> 19:29.200
OF OUR BRAND OR OUR BUSINESS.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.833
STILL NEED THE MONEY, THOUGH.

19:31.833 --> 19:33.067
WE'LL DO THIS LATER.

19:33.067 --> 19:33.867
OH, GOD.

19:33.867 --> 19:36.200
CAN I GET THE MONEY, THOUGH?

19:43.533 --> 19:44.767
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, YOU

19:44.767 --> 19:45.733
KNOW, YOU NEVER GET A SECOND

19:45.733 --> 19:46.700
CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST

19:46.700 --> 19:47.667
IMPRESSION, BUT I DON'T

19:47.667 --> 19:48.567
BELIEVE THAT.

19:48.567 --> 19:49.500
I KNOW CHE' MACK WAS ACTING

19:49.500 --> 19:50.833
A LITTLE CRAZY AT THE CLUB, AND

19:50.833 --> 19:51.833
I KNOW THERE'S MORE TO IT

19:51.833 --> 19:52.600
THAN THAT.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.633
SO WHEN SHORTY CALLED ME AND

19:53.633 --> 19:54.433
TOLD ME HER CRIB GOT

19:54.433 --> 19:55.167
BROKEN INTO...

19:55.167 --> 19:56.433
[knocking on door]

19:56.433 --> 20:00.067
I HAD TO SO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

20:00.067 --> 20:01.267
OH, MY GOODNESS.

20:01.267 --> 20:03.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:03.000 --> 20:03.800
BUT YOU KNOW I HAD TO LAY

20:03.800 --> 20:05.300
DOWN THE LAW TO HER FIRST

20:05.300 --> 20:06.667
'CAUSE SHE WAS WAY OUT OF LINE

20:06.667 --> 20:07.633
WITH SOME OF THAT [bleep] SHE

20:07.633 --> 20:08.500
WAS TALKING.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.267
YOU KNOW, I HAD TO COME BY AND

20:09.267 --> 20:09.933
CHECK ON YOU.

20:09.933 --> 20:11.067
I HEARD SOMETHING HAPPENED, SO

20:11.067 --> 20:11.767
I WANTED MAKE SURE YOU WAS

20:11.767 --> 20:12.433
ALL RIGHT.

20:12.433 --> 20:13.133
OH, I'M GLAD YOU DID.

20:13.133 --> 20:14.200
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.267
AND LAST TIME I SEEN YOU--

20:15.267 --> 20:16.867
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE 'CAUSE--

20:16.867 --> 20:18.133
OH, YEAH?

20:18.133 --> 20:19.200
WHAT'S UP?

20:19.200 --> 20:20.133
YOU WERE GOING HARD.

20:20.133 --> 20:20.833
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

20:20.833 --> 20:21.633
YOU WAS GOING HARD ON ME.

20:21.633 --> 20:22.300
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

20:22.300 --> 20:23.333
IT WAS THE JAGER, AND IT WAS

20:23.333 --> 20:24.433
A BUILDUP, BECAUSE I REALLY

20:24.433 --> 20:25.667
WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW HOW

20:25.667 --> 20:26.433
I FELT.

20:26.433 --> 20:27.333
'CAUSE YOUR BEHAVIOR

20:27.333 --> 20:28.000
THE OTHER NIGHT LED ME TO

20:28.000 --> 20:28.967
BELIEVE I CAN'T CONTROL--

20:28.967 --> 20:30.133
I CAN'T CONTROL YOU.

20:30.133 --> 20:31.700
I AM AN AGGRESSIVE PERSON.

20:31.700 --> 20:32.367
OKAY.

20:32.367 --> 20:33.167
I HAVE AN ABILITY TO TURN IT

20:33.167 --> 20:34.867
ON AND TURN IT OFF.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.000
I LIKE YOU TO TURN IT UP,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.533
BUT FOR ME TO WORK WITH YOU--

20:37.533 --> 20:38.233
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

20:38.233 --> 20:39.767
I WORK WITH THE DIDDYS,

20:39.767 --> 20:41.600
THE JAYS, THE BEYONCES,

20:41.600 --> 20:43.767
THE WAYNES, THIS ONE, AND

20:43.767 --> 20:44.833
THAT ONE.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.600
IT'S GONNA BE A RISK FOR ME.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.133
LET'S JUST SWEEP THAT

20:48.133 --> 20:49.600
SITUATION UNDER THE RUG,

20:49.600 --> 20:50.267
AND, LIKE--

20:50.267 --> 20:51.933
EVENTUALLY.

20:51.933 --> 20:52.733
LIKE, YOU'RE ABOUT TO MAKE

20:52.733 --> 20:54.333
ME CRY.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.467
IT'S ALL GOOD.

20:56.467 --> 20:57.700
NAH, 'CAUSE IT'S LIKE--

20:57.700 --> 20:58.800
NAH, I DON'T WANT--

20:58.800 --> 20:59.700
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:59.700 --> 21:00.433
NO, NO, IT'S COOL.

21:00.433 --> 21:01.233
IT'S COOL.

21:01.233 --> 21:01.900
LIKE, I GOT TO GO

21:01.900 --> 21:02.567
THROUGH ALL THIS.

21:02.567 --> 21:04.400
IT'S JUST ME BY MYSELF.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.100
SO HERE'S--I PUT IN ALL THIS

21:06.100 --> 21:07.300
WORK, AND DON'T NOBODY WANT TO

21:07.300 --> 21:08.333
DO NOTHING.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.533
IT'S MAKING ME MAD.

21:09.533 --> 21:10.700
LIKE, THIS [bleep]--THIS [bleep]

21:10.700 --> 21:11.867
IS FOR REAL.

21:11.867 --> 21:13.067
LIKE, MOTHER[bleep] CAME INTO MY

21:13.067 --> 21:14.400
HOUSE AND STOLE MY STUFF.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.500
I GOT TO REPLACE IT.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.467
NOBODY--

21:16.467 --> 21:17.367
LISTEN, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

21:17.367 --> 21:18.300
LISTEN TO ME.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.233
I'M NOT--I'M--

21:19.233 --> 21:20.233
NO, YOU--

21:20.233 --> 21:21.400
Y'ALL DON'T UNDERSTAND.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.067
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

21:23.067 --> 21:24.800
ALL RIGHT?

21:24.800 --> 21:25.667
DRY YOUR EYES.

21:25.667 --> 21:26.667
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

21:26.667 --> 21:27.567
HOLD UP.

21:27.567 --> 21:28.567
YOU KNOW ME.

21:28.567 --> 21:30.633
I HATE TO SEE A WOMAN CRY.

21:33.533 --> 21:36.200
[laughing]

21:36.200 --> 21:37.500
I FIGURE YOU IN HERE--

21:37.500 --> 21:39.233
YOU CAN'T WATCH NO TV [bleep]

21:39.233 --> 21:40.633
BE CRYING BY YOURSELF.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.367
YOU BETTER CRY TO THE TV.

21:42.367 --> 21:43.733
[both laughing]

21:43.733 --> 21:44.633
I WANTED TO BRING A LITTLE

21:44.633 --> 21:45.767
SMILE TO HER FACE JUST TO LET

21:45.767 --> 21:47.600
HER KNOW, IF SHE ACT RIGHT,

21:47.600 --> 21:49.133
SHE COULD BE SMILING FOR A VERY

21:49.133 --> 21:50.533
LONG TIME.

21:50.533 --> 21:51.400
I GOT YOU.

21:51.400 --> 21:52.067
YOU'RE GOOD.

21:52.067 --> 21:53.067

21:53.067 --> 21:53.700
I JUST DON'T WANT TO

21:53.700 --> 21:54.367
BE THAT--

21:54.367 --> 21:55.067
YOU AIN'T CRYING.

21:55.067 --> 21:55.900
YOU SMILING.

21:55.900 --> 21:56.600
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

21:56.600 --> 21:57.467
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN LOOKED DOWN

21:57.467 --> 21:59.067
A LOT, AND I'M NOT GONNA LET

21:59.067 --> 21:59.667

22:07.400 --> 22:08.800
I'M STARTING QUARTERBACK.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.333
MM-HMM.

22:10.333 --> 22:12.067
WE GONNA GET YOU TRAINED SO YOU

22:12.067 --> 22:14.700
CAN BE READY FOR THE GAME.

22:21.333 --> 22:22.133
WE CAN DO SOME KIND OF

22:22.133 --> 22:23.667
FLORAL DESIGN.

22:23.667 --> 22:24.333
MM-HMM.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.100
LIKE, MAYBE FLOWERS.

22:26.100 --> 22:27.533
MM-HMM, LIKE A VINE.

22:27.533 --> 22:28.200

22:28.200 --> 22:28.967
IT'LL HAVE TO--THAT'S

22:28.967 --> 22:29.767
THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF,

22:29.767 --> 22:31.067
LIKE A VINE AND FLOWERS.

22:31.067 --> 22:32.667
REALLY PRETTY TOO.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.067
VERY PRETTY.

22:34.067 --> 22:36.067
SO AFTER THE UNCOMFORTABLE

22:36.067 --> 22:37.800
CONVERSATION I HAD WITH STEVIE

22:37.800 --> 22:39.433
THE OTHER DAY, I DECIDED IT WAS

22:39.433 --> 22:41.067
FINALLY TIME FOR ME TO GET RID

22:41.067 --> 22:43.567
OF THE ONE LAST REMINDER I HAD

22:43.567 --> 22:45.500
OF THIS OLD RELATIONSHIP.

22:45.500 --> 22:46.533
I GOT THE TATTOO.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.533
STEVIE HAD THE TATTOO FIRST.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.800
I NEVER NOTICED THAT.

22:49.800 --> 22:50.467
WOW.

22:50.467 --> 22:51.333
I AIN'T NEVER KNOW THAT.

22:51.333 --> 22:52.067
YEAH.

22:52.067 --> 22:53.067
START THAT THING TODAY.

22:53.067 --> 22:53.833
YOU NEED TO STOP PLAYING

22:53.833 --> 22:54.833
AROUND WITH THE OLD AND BRINGING

22:54.833 --> 22:55.700

22:55.700 --> 22:56.633
I'VE ALREADY STARTED THAT

22:56.633 --> 22:58.333
PROCESS, SO...

22:58.333 --> 22:59.167
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET

22:59.167 --> 23:00.367
SOMETHING THAT'S ABOUT STRENGTH,

23:00.367 --> 23:01.900
ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE AT NOW

23:01.900 --> 23:03.300
TODAY IN YOUR LIFE.

23:03.300 --> 23:06.233
A NEW CHAPTER.

23:06.233 --> 23:08.567
A NEW ARM.

23:08.567 --> 23:10.833
WHAT YOU DOING, NIKKO?

23:10.833 --> 23:12.067
HIGH FIVE, GIRL.

23:12.067 --> 23:14.067
YES.

23:14.067 --> 23:15.767
THIS IS NOT ABOUT STEVIE.

23:15.767 --> 23:18.233
IT'S NOT ABOUT NIKKO.

23:18.233 --> 23:20.567
IT'S NOT ABOUT ANYBODY.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.500
I'M NOT LIVING MY LIFE FOR

23:21.500 --> 23:23.500
ANYBODY ELSE.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.200
IT'S ABOUT ME, MY DAUGHTER,
