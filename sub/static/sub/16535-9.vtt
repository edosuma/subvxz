WEBVTT

00:00.007 --> 00:03.293
I have not always been proud
of the way I've lived my life.

00:03.333 --> 00:05.001
This is something
that I'll never regret.

00:05.035 --> 00:06.068
Kelly's your donor.

00:06.103 --> 00:07.904
My God.

00:07.938 --> 00:09.238
We had to take Anna off chemo.

00:09.273 --> 00:10.907
That's it? You just let her die?

00:10.941 --> 00:11.908
I'm sorry, Kelly.

00:11.942 --> 00:13.309
Can I get another pour?

00:14.645 --> 00:17.176
Got a young girl, nonresponsive.

00:17.210 --> 00:19.582
That's Severide's car.

00:19.616 --> 00:21.851
- This is bad.
- Yeah, I know.

00:21.885 --> 00:23.619
- What's wrong?
- You got to come with us.

00:23.654 --> 00:24.987
I'm not going anywhere.

00:25.022 --> 00:26.756
You can either come with us now

00:26.790 --> 00:28.591
or wait for some uniforms
to come down here

00:28.625 --> 00:29.592
and put you in cuffs.

00:29.626 --> 00:30.927
What did I do?

00:34.298 --> 00:36.934
- Didn't ask for a lawyer?
- Not yet.

00:37.709 --> 00:39.544
Sure you're okay with this?

00:39.578 --> 00:41.646
Yeah. Kelly and I dated for a minute.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.481
It's not a conflict of interest for me.

00:43.515 --> 00:44.882
And the only reason he hasn't

00:44.917 --> 00:46.484
asked for a lawyer is because he knows

00:46.518 --> 00:48.619
I'm gonna be in on the interview.

00:50.589 --> 00:52.256
Hey.

00:52.291 --> 00:54.859
You okay? You need a cup of coffee or...

00:54.893 --> 00:57.772
No, no. I just want to get out of here.

00:58.630 --> 00:59.931
Then we're all on the same page.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.683
Would you take us through last night?

01:04.569 --> 01:06.204
I gave an autologus blood donation

01:06.238 --> 01:08.239
because I was gonna donate bone marrow

01:08.273 --> 01:10.007
to this girl, Anna.

01:10.042 --> 01:11.532
You know this.

01:12.611 --> 01:14.173
But the surgery...

01:15.280 --> 01:16.681
they couldn't go forward with it.

01:16.715 --> 01:18.549
The chemo started killing her.

01:18.584 --> 01:19.750
They cancelled it.

01:19.785 --> 01:21.886
51 says you didn't come to shift.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.721
I was in a bad mood

01:23.755 --> 01:24.899
because of the cancelled surgery,

01:24.923 --> 01:27.258
so, no, I took the shift off.

01:27.292 --> 01:28.661
Where'd you go?

01:29.161 --> 01:30.819
Tap on Rush.

01:31.515 --> 01:32.930
How many drinks you have?

01:32.965 --> 01:34.298
I don't know. I didn't count,

01:34.333 --> 01:36.116
but I started feeling...

01:37.569 --> 01:38.825
Feeling?

01:41.276 --> 01:42.740
Like I'd had enough.

01:42.957 --> 01:44.575
So, you left...

01:44.610 --> 01:45.743
in your car.

01:45.777 --> 01:47.879
- That's the thing.
- Okay. What is?

01:47.913 --> 01:52.149
Um, I don't know if it was
giving blood or the alcohol

01:52.184 --> 01:53.918
or both,

01:53.952 --> 01:55.620
but I don't remember.

01:55.654 --> 01:57.054
You're saying you blacked out?

01:58.323 --> 01:59.757
Yeah.

01:59.791 --> 02:01.292
From the car wreck?

02:01.326 --> 02:02.760
No, because I wasn't in one.

02:03.127 --> 02:04.362
Well, how'd you cut your head?

02:08.267 --> 02:10.735
- I don't know.
- Kelly, we've got a mother

02:10.769 --> 02:12.603
and daughter in critical
condition at Med,

02:12.638 --> 02:15.606
and their minivan was hit
by your Mustang.

02:15.641 --> 02:17.742
Don't you think that I would remember

02:17.776 --> 02:20.230
if I crashed my car into them?

02:20.264 --> 02:21.756
You can't remember
how you cut your head.

02:21.780 --> 02:25.249
Look, guys, I've spent
the better part of my adult life

02:25.284 --> 02:26.631
responding to accidents,

02:26.666 --> 02:28.920
Woken up from a dead sleep
in the bunk room,

02:28.954 --> 02:31.458
and I'm half-awake on the way there.

02:31.493 --> 02:34.825
And I do it. Every time. Instinctively.

02:34.860 --> 02:36.827
So there is no version...
there's no scenario...

02:36.862 --> 02:40.631
there's no way that I go
to an accident, I see one,

02:40.666 --> 02:43.267
and I run away from a mother and
her daughter in need of help,

02:43.301 --> 02:44.901
especially if I'm the one who caused it.

02:46.398 --> 02:49.941
- Yeah?
- Hey.

02:50.374 --> 02:51.676
Give me a second.

02:55.647 --> 02:56.781
Just got a call from Med.

02:56.815 --> 02:58.683
Elsa James, the mother...

02:58.717 --> 03:00.587
left side of her body crushed.

03:00.622 --> 03:02.617
She's just coming out
of critical condition.

03:03.554 --> 03:05.147
And the girl?

03:06.057 --> 03:07.057
No.

03:14.733 --> 03:16.834
Erin, I didn't do this.

03:24.541 --> 03:26.843
Chloe James, the little girl
in the back seat...

03:29.948 --> 03:31.849
she just died from her injuries.

03:36.455 --> 03:38.774
This just went from hit-and-run

03:39.645 --> 03:41.692
to vehicular homicide.

04:01.413 --> 04:02.413
What are you doing?

04:02.940 --> 04:05.716
Voight wants us to build a timeline.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.125
Yeah. Can I have that a sec?

04:08.153 --> 04:09.253
Yeah.

04:15.145 --> 04:16.625
We just don't know what happened yet.

04:16.938 --> 04:19.396
I think we have a pretty good
idea based on the facts.

04:19.430 --> 04:22.232
If it was you, wouldn't you
want the benefit of the doubt?

04:22.800 --> 04:24.968
If I got plastered
and I killed a little girl,

04:25.003 --> 04:26.403
I wouldn't deserve it.

04:26.438 --> 04:28.005
All right, we're looking for witnesses

04:28.039 --> 04:30.908
that can put Severide
at the scene or in the car.

04:30.942 --> 04:32.843
Start at Med.
The mother's out of surgery.

04:32.877 --> 04:34.244
I started a cell tower dump,

04:34.279 --> 04:35.212
trying to triangulate his locations.

04:35.246 --> 04:37.347
Yeah, and I called
Accident Investigations.

04:37.382 --> 04:39.750
They're doing a workup
on Severide's Mustang right now.

04:39.784 --> 04:40.928
Look. Just to put it out there:

04:40.952 --> 04:42.920
Word is Severide's had a history

04:42.954 --> 04:44.488
of substance abuse in the past.

04:44.522 --> 04:46.523
He says he had a blood draw that day,

04:46.558 --> 04:47.991
had a few drinks...

04:48.026 --> 04:49.796
I don't think that's enough
to black out.

04:50.395 --> 04:51.939
So, he could've been on something else.

04:51.963 --> 04:53.274
Tell them to put a rush
on the tox report.

04:53.298 --> 04:55.432
Severide is a first responder.

04:55.467 --> 04:58.368
We owe it to him and the 51
to keep an open mind.

04:58.403 --> 05:01.939
Be thorough, get to the truth.

05:01.973 --> 05:03.440
Hey.

05:03.475 --> 05:04.842
Sorry. Am I late?

05:04.876 --> 05:06.276
No. We're early.

05:06.311 --> 05:07.578
Come on in my office.

05:08.546 --> 05:11.248
- Okay. Hey.
- Hey.

05:11.282 --> 05:13.550
I apologize, Sergeant.
I was with the Chief of Patrol.

05:13.585 --> 05:15.285
There was a mistake
on my transfer order.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.264
They thought I was moving
to another district, so...

05:17.288 --> 05:19.790
Okay, just so you know,
you're on short paper up here.

05:19.824 --> 05:23.527
That means grunt work,
tech stuff, writing warrants,

05:23.561 --> 05:24.928
just till you prove yourself.

05:24.963 --> 05:26.094
Yes, sir.

05:26.129 --> 05:27.808
Okay, I'm not looking
for the "yes" police.

05:27.832 --> 05:29.533
I'm looking for the real police,

05:29.567 --> 05:31.447
which we both know you are.

05:34.976 --> 05:37.574
No, Burgess, you're over there.
You take Adam's desk.

05:37.609 --> 05:39.810
Adam's moving over to Antonio's.

05:39.844 --> 05:41.078
- Give me that.
- Thank you.

05:42.413 --> 05:44.314
- Where is Adam?
- Said he had to step out,

05:44.615 --> 05:45.615
make a call.

05:45.868 --> 05:47.985
Okay, here's how we're gonna partner up.

05:48.019 --> 05:49.086
Jay and Erin.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.487
Kevin, you're with Adam.

05:51.023 --> 05:52.589
Al, you got Burgess.

05:52.624 --> 05:53.739
Okay.

05:54.492 --> 05:56.593
It's good to be working
with you, Detective...

05:56.628 --> 05:58.462
or Al.

05:58.496 --> 06:00.531
You too, kid.

06:21.386 --> 06:22.953
Excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. James.

06:22.987 --> 06:25.022
I'm Officer Ruzek.
This is Officer Atwater.

06:25.056 --> 06:25.789
We're from Intelligence.

06:25.823 --> 06:27.457
Do we have to do this right now?

06:27.492 --> 06:29.736
I'm sorry.
We have to ask a few questions.

06:29.926 --> 06:31.590
Richard, it's okay.

06:33.565 --> 06:34.998
Let's get this over with.

06:35.228 --> 06:39.369
Um, where were you
right before the accident?

06:39.404 --> 06:42.096
It was Chloe's birthday, so...

06:43.074 --> 06:46.043
so I took her to a concert
at the Double Door.

06:46.077 --> 06:49.479
Okay. About what time
did you leave Double Door?

06:49.514 --> 06:52.382
It was a little after 11:00.

06:52.417 --> 06:54.618
I wanted to get Chloe home.
It was a school night.

06:56.154 --> 07:00.123
That car... it came out of nowhere.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.350
When I looked back,

07:03.361 --> 07:05.462
she was bleeding and gasping.

07:07.098 --> 07:08.978
Were you able to get a look
at the other driver?

07:10.568 --> 07:13.337
White guy and dark hair.

07:14.439 --> 07:16.216
Can I show you a few pictures?

07:37.562 --> 07:39.029
Is that him, baby?

07:45.970 --> 07:47.537
Ma'am, is that him?

07:49.540 --> 07:51.341
I can't say for sure.

07:52.644 --> 07:54.344
Chloe would've known.

07:56.314 --> 07:59.449
I heard her scream
and I saw her point before it...

08:01.452 --> 08:02.686
All right. It's okay.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.521
You've been very helpful.

08:12.797 --> 08:15.632
- What was he drinking?
- His usual. Bourbon.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.301
Was he with anyone?

08:17.335 --> 08:18.769
Not initially. He was in a mood.

08:18.803 --> 08:20.114
He just wanted to throw 'em back,

08:20.138 --> 08:22.383
but then a couple of Oak Street
chicks started chatting him up,

08:22.407 --> 08:23.622
so they drank together.

08:23.656 --> 08:25.409
- How long were they here?
- All day.

08:25.994 --> 08:27.911
So, was he visibly drunk when he left?

08:27.946 --> 08:29.279
I'm a bartender in a bar.

08:29.314 --> 08:30.580
Most people are visibly drunk.

08:30.615 --> 08:32.482
Are you getting cute with me right now?

08:32.517 --> 08:34.284
- No, ma'am.
- Then answer my question

08:34.318 --> 08:36.385
before I have to shut this place
down all night

08:36.421 --> 08:37.654
to do a license premise check.

08:37.688 --> 08:39.485
Kelly was drunk.

08:40.717 --> 08:41.918
Drunk drunk.

08:46.030 --> 08:48.465
You gave the guy his keys
when he was a stumbling drunk?

08:48.499 --> 08:50.000
Come on, man. I'm running my ass off

08:50.034 --> 08:50.934
all night out here, okay?

08:50.968 --> 08:53.570
So, no, I didn't stop
and check on the guy.

08:53.604 --> 08:54.604
I'm sorry.

08:54.919 --> 08:57.180
I went and got his car,
he got into his car,

08:57.214 --> 08:58.575
and away he went.

09:00.044 --> 09:01.545
Are we done here?

09:04.182 --> 09:07.117
Hey. The valet just told me
he gave Severide his keys

09:07.151 --> 09:09.353
and he watched him drive off alone.

09:09.387 --> 09:12.122
Erin, I think you got to start
wrapping your head around

09:12.156 --> 09:15.125
the likelihood that Severide did this.

09:15.159 --> 09:17.661
And you've got to stop being
so quick to condemn him

09:17.695 --> 09:18.839
just 'cause he and I have history.

09:18.863 --> 09:20.820
This is not about him.

09:21.866 --> 09:23.834
It's about the little girl
in the morgue.

09:26.637 --> 09:28.474
That's him.

09:34.679 --> 09:36.513
What time was that?

09:36.547 --> 09:40.851
12:09 a.m.

09:40.885 --> 09:43.553
13 minutes after the accident.

09:43.588 --> 09:44.732
We're gonna need that footage.

09:44.756 --> 09:47.149
Don't you need a warrant?

09:48.013 --> 09:49.729
Burgess, you bring the warrant?

09:50.916 --> 09:52.362
I didn't...

09:52.397 --> 09:54.331
How much you got on you?

09:55.500 --> 09:57.234
Okay. Um...

10:01.172 --> 10:02.372
We're in a hurry.

10:02.407 --> 10:03.673
Yeah.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.477
12:09.

10:07.512 --> 10:08.987
That's plenty of time

10:09.022 --> 10:10.391
to get from the scene
of the accident to here.

10:10.415 --> 10:12.382
Yeah, talk about another nail
in the coffin.

10:12.417 --> 10:13.620
Yeah.

10:14.619 --> 10:16.730
Hey, I want you to know I'm not
gonna be one of those partners

10:16.754 --> 10:18.822
that you have to school all the time.

10:19.027 --> 10:20.207
I know what that's like.

10:20.241 --> 10:22.526
Get the footage and meet me in the car.

10:25.530 --> 10:26.747
Yeah?

10:26.781 --> 10:28.098
I got Severide's tox reports.

10:28.132 --> 10:29.777
What he said about giving
blood... that checks out,

10:29.801 --> 10:30.901
so his count was low.

10:30.935 --> 10:32.602
What was his blood-alcohol level?

10:33.024 --> 10:34.010
.21.

10:34.044 --> 10:36.407
That's over twice the legal limit.

10:36.441 --> 10:37.619
And he was on painkillers.

10:37.654 --> 10:39.543
We got what... 48 hours before
we got to put him

10:39.577 --> 10:41.233
before a judge for probable cause?

10:41.268 --> 10:43.457
I don't want to charge a
decorated firefighter with this,

10:43.481 --> 10:44.792
but can't have it look
like I'm giving him

10:44.816 --> 10:46.412
preferential treatment.

10:46.447 --> 10:48.014
I'm giving you 24 hours.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.519
After that, he gets shipped
down to 26th and Cal.

10:52.323 --> 10:54.135
What do you mean I can't see him?

10:54.160 --> 10:55.894
Am I not speaking clearly?

10:55.928 --> 10:56.995
He is in custody.

10:57.029 --> 11:00.765
- No visitors except his lawyer.
- I'm his union rep.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.934
Vehicular homicide is not
a union matter.

11:02.968 --> 11:05.804
I don't have a hacksaw blade
hidden up my wazoo.

11:05.838 --> 11:06.948
I just want to check on him.

11:06.972 --> 11:08.706
- Randy...
- I am asking...

11:08.741 --> 11:11.558
bend the rules this one time,

11:13.145 --> 11:15.213
or I'm not coming home tonight.

11:18.684 --> 11:20.018
What?

11:21.120 --> 11:22.754
You heard me.

11:37.036 --> 11:38.169
You okay?

11:38.204 --> 11:39.304
Not really.

11:39.338 --> 11:40.939
You talk to Boden? Where is he?

11:40.973 --> 11:42.184
Believe me. He is all over this.

11:42.208 --> 11:44.660
He's talking to the IG's office
right now.

11:46.846 --> 11:48.246
What have you told them?

11:48.280 --> 11:50.815
Everything I can remember,
which isn't much.

11:50.850 --> 11:54.243
Okay. From now on,
just keep your mouth shut.

11:54.277 --> 11:55.542
Gonna get you a lawyer.

11:55.577 --> 11:56.921
A lawyer? I didn't do this.

11:56.956 --> 11:59.000
They're talking homicide here.

11:59.825 --> 12:02.026
So, like I said, not another word.

12:02.061 --> 12:04.762
Visit's over.

12:05.798 --> 12:07.098
Yeah. Thanks.

12:16.242 --> 12:19.265
- You so owe me.
- I know.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.213
It's crazy how one bad decision can

12:22.248 --> 12:23.882
ruin your whole life?

12:23.916 --> 12:25.183
True that.

12:26.850 --> 12:29.273
- So, um, Adam...
- Yeah?

12:29.307 --> 12:31.856
What did he say
about me moving upstairs?

12:31.891 --> 12:36.027
Um, seemed pretty delighted, actually.

12:37.830 --> 12:39.307
I know that you got
your bro code and all,

12:39.331 --> 12:42.033
but you and me... we go way back.

12:42.067 --> 12:44.869
Okay, maybe "delighted"
is the wrong word.

12:44.904 --> 12:49.140
Um, honestly,
he seemed a little freaked out

12:49.715 --> 12:53.011
that his ex-fiancée
who he still has feelings for

12:53.045 --> 12:55.146
might be upstairs right beside him.

12:56.491 --> 12:58.628
I knew it. I knew it.

13:02.721 --> 13:04.722
Hey, check this out.

13:04.757 --> 13:06.903
- Yeah.
- You see that?

13:07.726 --> 13:09.366
GPS tracker.

13:09.962 --> 13:11.696
Someone was following Severide.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.121
Who could've put it there?

13:22.541 --> 13:23.775
I have no idea.

13:23.809 --> 13:26.044
All right, you make any enemies at 51?

13:26.477 --> 13:28.423
Sleep with someone's wife or girlfriend?

13:29.610 --> 13:30.848
No.

13:30.883 --> 13:32.784
Come on. Help yourself out here, Kelly.

13:32.818 --> 13:35.520
Maybe someone stole my car.
You consider that?

13:35.554 --> 13:38.623
Sure. But if someone stole
your car with your keys in it,

13:38.657 --> 13:39.968
how'd you get back into your apartment?

13:39.992 --> 13:42.026
I keep a spare set
in the fire extinguisher box

13:42.061 --> 13:43.188
in the stairwell.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.629
So, you remember that?

13:44.663 --> 13:46.484
Some of it's coming back.

13:46.518 --> 13:49.801
Okay. Do you remember driving home?

13:50.212 --> 13:54.972
A little, yeah. I drove about a block

13:55.007 --> 13:56.974
and I realized...

13:57.009 --> 13:58.649
I realized I shouldn't,
and I pulled over.

13:58.677 --> 14:00.435
Okay, and then what?

14:03.515 --> 14:04.482
I don't know.

14:04.516 --> 14:06.918
Okay, why'd you leave out
the oxy you popped?

14:06.952 --> 14:08.152
I forgot.

14:08.187 --> 14:09.754
They gave it to me a few days ago

14:09.788 --> 14:11.656
for a shoulder injury
that I got on a call.

14:11.690 --> 14:13.124
Why didn't you tell us about that?

14:16.528 --> 14:17.896
I want a lawyer.

14:17.930 --> 14:19.841
Kelly, I got to ask you this.
We're trying to help.

14:19.865 --> 14:21.733
- It doesn't feel like it.
- If you lawyer up,

14:21.767 --> 14:22.600
there's nothing we can do.

14:22.634 --> 14:25.395
I'm done talking here. I want a lawyer.

14:25.430 --> 14:27.872
Yeah?

14:27.906 --> 14:29.207
Real quick.

14:35.814 --> 14:37.849
Okay, so, I subpoenaed
the tracker company,

14:37.883 --> 14:39.861
got a name and address listed
on the purchase order,

14:39.885 --> 14:41.196
- but it's all fake.
- And then what?

14:41.220 --> 14:42.864
And then they gave me
historical information

14:42.888 --> 14:44.555
on the device, and at first,

14:44.590 --> 14:46.034
I mean, it just looked
like a bunch of numbers,

14:46.058 --> 14:48.025
but then I realized
it's longitude and latitude.

14:48.060 --> 14:50.595
Okay, you're doing great, Kim,
but just give us the punch line.

14:50.629 --> 14:53.365
The tracker was turned on at 10:45 p.m.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.032
at Tap on Rush.

14:57.069 --> 14:59.036
Okay, we're probably looking

14:59.071 --> 15:00.872
at a robbery crew
that's targeting patrons

15:00.906 --> 15:03.574
in the Viagra Triangle area
of Rush Street.

15:03.609 --> 15:04.786
Right. Auto Theft Unit says
thieves have been

15:04.810 --> 15:07.712
placing trackers on luxury cars
so they can jack them later.

15:07.746 --> 15:09.586
All right, we're gonna
split up into two teams,

15:09.615 --> 15:11.048
set up surveillance.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.550
Nice work.

15:12.584 --> 15:14.051
Team effort.

15:19.691 --> 15:21.092
Hank, do me a favor, man.

15:21.894 --> 15:23.327
Put Burgess with somebody else.

15:23.362 --> 15:24.959
Well, there is nobody else.

15:24.993 --> 15:27.899
Then let her run plates or
write up warrants or something.

15:27.933 --> 15:29.987
Come on. What's the problem, Al?

15:30.936 --> 15:32.739
This job is gonna rip her heart out,

15:33.372 --> 15:34.772
and I don't want a front row seat.

15:34.807 --> 15:35.940
Either it will or it won't,

15:35.974 --> 15:38.236
but she's earned the right to find out.

15:38.944 --> 15:41.078
Anybody got eyes on this valet?

15:41.523 --> 15:44.081
Valet just pulled out of the
parking lot in a black Maserati.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.087
He is climbing out.

15:52.724 --> 15:54.592
What's he doing, Kev?

15:58.363 --> 16:00.064
He's got a tracker.

16:02.634 --> 16:05.515
Valet just put a GPS tracker
on the Maserati.

16:05.971 --> 16:07.805
He's getting in. He's coming your way.

16:09.908 --> 16:11.776
In five, four,

16:11.810 --> 16:13.845
three, two, one.

16:13.879 --> 16:14.879
Move in.

16:14.913 --> 16:16.047
10-4.

16:26.692 --> 16:27.859
Chicago PD!

16:30.162 --> 16:31.863
You remember me?

16:38.770 --> 16:41.072
- You get lost a lot?
- Those aren't mine.

16:41.106 --> 16:43.407
You're gonna end up in that
trunk in about two seconds.

16:43.442 --> 16:45.810
All right, all right, um...

16:45.844 --> 16:47.411
listen, I only put on the trackers.

16:47.446 --> 16:48.679
Okay. For who?

16:48.714 --> 16:49.924
I don't know. A guy named Mike.

16:49.948 --> 16:51.015
Guy named Mike?

16:51.049 --> 16:52.350
That's the best you can do?

16:52.384 --> 16:54.018
I didn't ask a last name, okay?

16:54.052 --> 16:55.305
He didn't tell me one.

16:55.339 --> 16:57.200
He was offering 500 bucks a tracker.

16:57.234 --> 16:58.823
He said he only wanted primo cars.

16:58.857 --> 17:00.825
Well, the tracker
on that Maserati's still hot.

17:00.859 --> 17:03.004
Whoever's monitoring those
things is probably close by.

17:03.028 --> 17:06.329
All right, this surveillance
just turned into a decoy sting.

17:06.365 --> 17:07.932
Get up.

17:07.965 --> 17:11.002
You're gonna call Mike
and tell him you got a primo.

17:20.180 --> 17:21.604
My bad.

17:22.565 --> 17:24.392
I didn't know that you had
feelings like that for Severide

17:24.415 --> 17:26.063
when you guys dated.

17:27.248 --> 17:29.020
I didn't.

17:40.333 --> 17:43.000
My, my real dad...

17:44.770 --> 17:47.505
is out of prison and wants to meet.

17:49.584 --> 17:51.909
Bunny just sprung all this on me.

17:54.632 --> 17:56.781
That might be
why I've seemed a little off.

17:58.976 --> 18:00.083
You gonna meet him?

18:00.919 --> 18:02.420
I don't know.

18:04.852 --> 18:07.257
It's like every time
my life starts to feel normal

18:07.638 --> 18:08.893
there's another pothole.

18:15.406 --> 18:18.202
Game time. We got a suspicious vehicle.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.693
We see him.

18:25.978 --> 18:27.345
Illinois tags.

18:27.379 --> 18:30.081
Four, five, Victor, Boy, Sam,
six, seven.

18:30.115 --> 18:31.721
I'll run them.

18:32.451 --> 18:34.345
This is Officer Kim Burgess.

18:34.739 --> 18:35.872
Run an Illinois plate.

18:35.905 --> 18:38.550
Four, five, Victor, Boy, Sam,
six, seven.

18:38.584 --> 18:39.894
Just a second.

18:41.846 --> 18:43.714
This vehicle comes back hot.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.983
All right, as soon as they
move on that Maserati,

18:46.017 --> 18:47.551
we surround him.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.119
Copy that.

18:53.591 --> 18:54.591
What's he doing?

19:01.833 --> 19:04.067
He got spooked. Move in.

19:27.191 --> 19:29.005
Atwater, force him onto Columbus.

19:29.039 --> 19:31.094
Coming around now. We got him, boss.

19:38.636 --> 19:41.144
Halstead, get over to Michigan
in case he pops up there.

19:41.179 --> 19:42.773
10-4. Headed that way.

19:50.379 --> 19:52.149
Clear on the left. Go!

20:19.110 --> 20:21.678
Go around it. Go around it.

20:25.616 --> 20:27.250
Dispatch, this is Officer Kim Burgess.

20:27.285 --> 20:28.362
We have an accident involving a bus

20:28.386 --> 20:30.587
at Columbus and East Congress Parkway.

20:30.621 --> 20:32.055
Copy that.

20:35.126 --> 20:37.728
- You got eyes?
- Nothing.

20:37.762 --> 20:39.830
Dispatch, this is Sergeant Hank Voight

20:39.864 --> 20:42.165
in pursuit of a stolen black Camaro.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.800
Hank, Hank, back up.

20:44.769 --> 20:46.603
Dispatch, stand by.

20:46.637 --> 20:48.538
Copy that. Standing by.

21:02.887 --> 21:05.322
- Cover.
- Chicago PD!

21:16.300 --> 21:18.702
Dispatch, this is Voight.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.771
I need all patrol units in the area

21:20.805 --> 21:23.640
in search of two male offenders on foot.

21:23.674 --> 21:25.742
Do you have a description, Sergeant?

21:28.246 --> 21:29.746
Negative.

21:38.752 --> 21:40.651
All right, don't get comfortable.

21:40.738 --> 21:42.420
We got beat tonight
Glike a rookie tact team.

21:42.444 --> 21:45.141
No one goes home till we get
these guys in cuffs. Understand?

21:45.176 --> 21:47.077
Now, is there any way
to reverse the signal

21:47.111 --> 21:48.745
from the tracker on the Maserati?

21:48.779 --> 21:51.047
I don't know. I can call the
tech guys from Homan Square.

21:51.082 --> 21:52.592
All right, where we at with the Camaro?

21:52.616 --> 21:53.694
We know that the plates were stolen.

21:53.718 --> 21:55.295
And I can try to get
the registered owner down here,

21:55.319 --> 21:56.630
see if we can stumble on something else.

21:56.654 --> 21:58.165
I think we've stumbled
on enough tonight.

21:58.189 --> 21:59.022
I want something solid.

21:59.056 --> 22:00.757
I already started working on the BOLO.

22:00.791 --> 22:02.002
I'll have CPIC and the state police

22:02.026 --> 22:04.594
put out an All Call message over
ISPERN and all the city-wides.

22:04.628 --> 22:06.796
- Your office, Sergeant.
- Yeah. Come on in.

22:12.803 --> 22:13.937
Lieutenant.

22:13.971 --> 22:16.639
Heard you found some sort
of tracker on Kelly's car

22:16.674 --> 22:18.808
and that car thieves were
responsible for this.

22:18.843 --> 22:20.744
Yeah, well, my team's looking into that,

22:20.778 --> 22:22.422
but we still don't have enough
to release him yet.

22:22.446 --> 22:24.314
- Why not?
- Look, a carjacking crew

22:24.348 --> 22:26.282
may well have put that tracker
on Kelly's car,

22:26.317 --> 22:28.818
and they may well have intended
on stealing it later.

22:28.853 --> 22:30.854
But Kelly may have frustrated
those efforts

22:30.888 --> 22:32.789
by getting in the car accident first.

22:32.823 --> 22:35.158
He wouldn't have gotten
into an accident and run.

22:35.192 --> 22:36.303
That's what we're trying to prove.

22:36.327 --> 22:39.028
Can't you release him and then
continue to investigate?

22:39.063 --> 22:40.130
- I can't.
- Why?

22:40.164 --> 22:41.732
It'll look like favoritism.

22:41.766 --> 22:45.101
You know what, Hank? It feels
like I'm being stiff-armed here.

22:45.136 --> 22:47.403
You and me got history.
Is that what it is?

22:49.240 --> 22:50.807
I thought we'd buried all of that.

22:50.841 --> 22:52.375
So did I.

22:52.409 --> 22:54.187
Let's try and make sure
it's not preventing Kelly

22:54.211 --> 22:55.308
from getting a fair shake.

22:55.342 --> 22:56.976
Why don't you take a look out there?

22:57.848 --> 22:59.192
None of those people are going home

22:59.216 --> 23:00.847
until we figure this out.

23:01.719 --> 23:03.230
Now, if you want,
I can have this transferred

23:03.254 --> 23:04.687
over to Homicide,

23:04.722 --> 23:06.055
but let me tell you something:

23:06.090 --> 23:08.792
At best, Kelly'd be
sitting in a jail cell

23:08.826 --> 23:09.993
waiting for trial.

23:10.248 --> 23:14.197
At worst, he'll be doing five
years for murdering that girl.

23:14.231 --> 23:17.250
All right,
let me ask you this, Sergeant.

23:18.169 --> 23:20.127
Do you think Kelly did this?

23:20.928 --> 23:22.689
No, I don't.

23:23.841 --> 23:25.485
But listen, it doesn't matter
what I think.

23:25.509 --> 23:28.077
It matters what the state's
attorney can prove.

23:28.112 --> 23:30.480
And right now, that's
putting Kelly behind the wheel.

23:35.452 --> 23:37.119
Hey, Sarge.

23:37.922 --> 23:40.456
Well, look at you, all overdressed.

23:41.936 --> 23:44.761
Okay. Um, look, I was just wondering

23:44.795 --> 23:46.496
do you need a Title III
or a search warrant

23:46.530 --> 23:48.431
to dump information off a cell phone?

23:48.465 --> 23:51.434
Well, gosh, one of your fancy
friends upstairs should know.

23:51.468 --> 23:53.269
Come on, Sarge, you're my homegirl.

23:53.304 --> 23:55.238
You know that!

23:57.834 --> 23:59.876
Title III is for a wire tap.

23:59.910 --> 24:01.411
What you want is a search warrant,

24:01.445 --> 24:05.114
and since a judge needs to sign it,

24:05.149 --> 24:06.349
you better proof it first.

24:06.383 --> 24:08.384
Got it. Yes. Thank you, Sarge.

24:08.419 --> 24:10.666
Hey. How's it going with Olinsky?

24:11.155 --> 24:13.122
Um, it's great.

24:13.157 --> 24:14.224
He's a legend.

24:14.258 --> 24:15.892
Word of advice:

24:15.926 --> 24:17.237
Just ride it out with the old dog;

24:17.261 --> 24:19.362
He's got '74 syndrome.

24:19.396 --> 24:20.463
What do you mean?

24:20.497 --> 24:23.387
March 1, 1974,

24:23.934 --> 24:26.236
the day females started to ride patrol.

24:26.270 --> 24:28.238
Lot of old-timers resented us gals

24:28.272 --> 24:30.786
being considered equal in their car.

24:31.585 --> 24:33.076
I never got that hit off Olinsky.

24:33.110 --> 24:34.377
Well, he's come a long way,

24:34.411 --> 24:37.636
but some things get hard-wired.

24:38.530 --> 24:39.549
Okay.

24:39.583 --> 24:40.938
Thanks.

24:44.488 --> 24:46.422
Pow! Thank you, Sarge!

24:48.292 --> 24:49.893
That was the AIU Tech.

24:49.927 --> 24:52.128
He said the blood on the
dashboard of Severide's Mustang

24:52.162 --> 24:53.930
came back inconclusive.

24:53.964 --> 24:56.232
So, we still can't clear him
from being behind the wheel?

24:56.267 --> 24:57.310
- No.
- If we can figure out

24:57.334 --> 24:59.535
who this crew is selling
cars to, we can find them.

24:59.570 --> 25:02.171
I actually got a guy.
He fabricates keys and chips

25:02.206 --> 25:03.139
for stolen vehicles.

25:03.173 --> 25:05.341
I've been slowly cultivating him
into a C.I.

25:05.376 --> 25:07.777
Yeah, well, speed it up.
Put a fire under his ass.

25:07.811 --> 25:09.145
All right.

25:17.554 --> 25:18.821
What the hell, Kev?

25:18.856 --> 25:20.456
Reece, what's up, dog?

25:20.491 --> 25:21.791
How you doing?

25:21.825 --> 25:23.426
You working on these?

25:23.460 --> 25:25.194
This for a beemer?

25:25.229 --> 25:27.196
Man, you coming up
in the world now, Reece.

25:27.231 --> 25:28.608
That's what I'm talking about.
Who's this for?

25:28.632 --> 25:30.333
Nobody.

25:30.367 --> 25:31.868
Tell me who it's for,

25:32.303 --> 25:33.836
or you're gonna get the matching one.

25:35.472 --> 25:37.507
- Zadra.
- Zadra who?

25:37.746 --> 25:39.475
Michael Zadra.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.611
Runs stolen rides out of Rogers Park.

25:41.645 --> 25:45.315
He usually deals in the basics,
you know? Hondas and Toyotas.

25:45.349 --> 25:47.116
But the last few months,
he's been wanting

25:47.151 --> 25:48.823
these high-end copies cut.

25:48.857 --> 25:51.120
Okay, so, you cut the keys.
Who jacks the cars?

25:51.155 --> 25:52.488
I don't know.

25:52.523 --> 25:53.890
He gives me cars' computers,

25:53.924 --> 25:56.023
and I make them new sets
of keys and fobs.

25:56.057 --> 25:57.538
I don't ask his life story.

25:57.572 --> 25:59.562
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Kev! My man.

25:59.596 --> 26:02.132
He's waiting on new car keys
to be delivered, right?

26:02.933 --> 26:04.467
You're gonna help us deliver them.

26:04.805 --> 26:06.536
And what do I get?

26:07.246 --> 26:08.524
You get to not go to jail.

26:10.274 --> 26:11.568
Let's ride.

26:37.368 --> 26:39.902
Yo, Z! It's me.

26:41.405 --> 26:42.698
I got your keys.

26:49.413 --> 26:51.347
Chicago Police! Get down on the ground!

26:51.382 --> 26:53.383
- CPD! Let me see your hands!
- Down on the ground!

26:53.417 --> 26:55.385
Get down. Keep your hands
where we can see them.

26:55.419 --> 26:56.886
- Hands up!
- Get down!

26:56.920 --> 26:58.621
Hey, hey, hey! You two! Right there!

26:58.655 --> 27:00.590
- Get down! Get down!
- Walk towards me.

27:00.624 --> 27:01.935
Keep your hands where we can see them.

27:01.959 --> 27:02.925
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Right there!

27:02.960 --> 27:04.027
Hands up! Move forward!

27:04.061 --> 27:05.271
Hey, hey! Keep your hands
where we can see them.

27:05.295 --> 27:06.429
Walk towards me. Reece.

27:06.463 --> 27:08.931
- Walk towards me. Get down.
- Jay, two coming at you.

27:10.567 --> 27:12.468
Everyone on the street...

27:12.503 --> 27:15.104
they're gonna know you're a snitch.

27:15.139 --> 27:18.408
Don't worry about him.
You got your own problems now.

27:24.161 --> 27:27.029
Single file. Watch your heads.

27:27.063 --> 27:28.987
If you're lookin for a low bond,

27:29.022 --> 27:31.879
I suggest you keep your mouth
shut in front of the judge.

27:32.435 --> 27:34.269
- Hey.
- Anything?

27:34.304 --> 27:36.567
Not yet, but...

27:38.252 --> 27:40.754
Sarge, at least let me take him
to 26th and Cal myself.

27:40.788 --> 27:42.722
Unless you are ready to cut him loose,

27:42.757 --> 27:44.224
it's against regulations.

27:44.258 --> 27:46.459
He rides with the others. I'm sorry.

27:51.866 --> 27:53.280
Hey,

27:55.603 --> 27:58.338
if it turns out
that I was behind the wheel,

27:58.372 --> 28:00.707
don't let anyone try
and make a deal for me.

28:00.741 --> 28:02.072
Just...

28:04.378 --> 28:05.512
let me rot.

28:05.546 --> 28:06.846
Let's move it.

28:25.266 --> 28:27.009
Well, you've been a busy boy.

28:27.768 --> 28:32.272
Re-tagged and sold almost 100
stolen cars this year.

28:32.306 --> 28:34.020
You ship them over to Poland?

28:34.978 --> 28:37.744
You coming into my garage like that...

28:37.778 --> 28:39.746
I never saw a warrant.

28:39.780 --> 28:41.581
I'd say that's trespassing.

28:41.615 --> 28:43.660
You never saw a warrant?
You never showed him a warrant?

28:43.684 --> 28:45.752
I did, but everything happened
so fast, I guess.

28:45.786 --> 28:48.288
Well, we got one. Trust me.

28:49.690 --> 28:52.725
But you're not here
for selling stolen cars.

28:53.169 --> 28:55.762
You're here 'cause we need the guys

28:55.796 --> 28:58.429
that are jacking them for you;
You understand?

28:59.433 --> 29:01.734
You give us them, you walk.

29:03.504 --> 29:07.440
Certain people bring me cars.
I give them new VINs,

29:07.475 --> 29:08.741
ship them overseas.

29:08.776 --> 29:10.810
Know what a Maybach goes for in Warsaw?

29:10.845 --> 29:12.445
Who steals the cars?

29:12.480 --> 29:14.124
I've only dealt with Ryan.

29:14.749 --> 29:17.617
I had an argument with him
this week over prices.

29:17.651 --> 29:19.352
He wanted more money per car

29:19.386 --> 29:21.066
'cause he has to split it
with his partner.

29:21.349 --> 29:24.657
To smooth things over,
I fronted Ryan some cash.

29:24.692 --> 29:27.293
50 grand for three nice rides,

29:27.743 --> 29:29.500
which he never delivered to me.

29:29.802 --> 29:31.136
How do we get ahold of him?

29:32.212 --> 29:33.379
It ain't easy.

29:33.693 --> 29:36.958
He gives me a new burner phone
every time we do business.

29:37.671 --> 29:40.640
I put a call out. He calls me.

29:41.039 --> 29:43.843
Well, the problem is that your guy Ryan

29:44.390 --> 29:46.513
stole a car from a firefighter,

29:46.547 --> 29:48.715
crashes into a mother and daughter.

29:48.749 --> 29:50.783
Now that firefighter's facing
homicide charges.

29:51.167 --> 29:52.485
Well, that's his problem.

29:52.520 --> 29:53.662
No, actually...

29:54.599 --> 29:56.494
actually it is your problem.

29:57.358 --> 30:00.226
See, there's a thing called
reasonable suspicion.

30:00.510 --> 30:02.328
If he's filling your shopping list,

30:02.363 --> 30:04.197
then you can be held responsible

30:04.231 --> 30:05.832
for whatever Ryan did on the street.

30:06.230 --> 30:08.501
- Whoa. What?
- So, you ain't going anywhere

30:08.536 --> 30:10.236
until we get Ryan.

30:10.445 --> 30:11.712
You understand?

30:15.543 --> 30:18.344
Ryan Novak. He's the guy
Zadra was getting cars from.

30:18.379 --> 30:19.846
Did three years in Menard for GTA

30:19.880 --> 30:21.135
and aggravated carjacking.

30:21.169 --> 30:22.775
Paroled a year ago.

30:22.809 --> 30:25.351
And if it's dark and this guy
speeds by you in a car at night,

30:25.386 --> 30:27.097
you could easily mistake him
for Severide.

30:27.132 --> 30:28.467
- You got an address?
- Yeah.

30:28.502 --> 30:29.913
LKA was his mother's house.

30:29.948 --> 30:32.358
Katrina Novak.
She owns a house up on Lawrence.

30:32.393 --> 30:33.826
I already got a warrant signed.

30:33.861 --> 30:35.189
Okay.

30:35.941 --> 30:38.364
You and Atwater grab Ruzek,
hit that house.

30:38.399 --> 30:39.732
Here you go.

30:57.751 --> 30:59.385
Chicago PD!

31:05.259 --> 31:07.227
There's someone moving around in there.

31:10.931 --> 31:12.599
- Clear.
- Hey!

31:14.768 --> 31:16.636
Thought you were going somewhere?

31:16.670 --> 31:18.438
Where's your son?

31:18.472 --> 31:19.772
How would I know?

31:21.408 --> 31:23.409
There's a warrant. That's your copy.

31:23.444 --> 31:25.388
You can keep it. We're gonna
have to go through your bag.

31:25.412 --> 31:26.892
Keep your hands where I can see them.

31:36.943 --> 31:38.711
You been selling a lot of Amway?

31:43.430 --> 31:44.631
Hey, you see this?

31:44.665 --> 31:46.766
Tools for the entire operation
right here.

31:51.472 --> 31:53.609
A girl was killed in a car wreck,

31:53.643 --> 31:55.860
and we know your son is responsible.

31:56.477 --> 31:58.444
We've got you holding his gear
and his cash

31:58.479 --> 31:59.885
and ready to blow town,

31:59.919 --> 32:01.599
so we know you've been
in contact with him.

32:03.651 --> 32:05.318
Found these in the lining of her bag.

32:07.110 --> 32:09.310
There's got to be at least
half a dozen identities here.

32:09.514 --> 32:11.090
Most of these track back
to stolen property

32:11.114 --> 32:13.115
at pawn shops and cash-for-gold places.

32:13.150 --> 32:15.918
Got a Kimberly. Got a Donna.
You got a Susan.

32:15.953 --> 32:19.121
Start running those ID,
I bet we come up with a few felonies.

32:19.146 --> 32:21.958
Or we can charge her
with vehicular homicide.

32:21.992 --> 32:23.893
Got plenty to go on.

32:23.927 --> 32:25.161
What do you want?

32:25.195 --> 32:26.653
Call your son.

32:27.097 --> 32:30.166
Tell him turn himself in.
We'll let you go. No charges.

32:30.518 --> 32:32.444
I wouldn't waste my time.

32:33.437 --> 32:36.165
Ryan will never give himself up
to the cops.

32:37.100 --> 32:39.001
There's always Plan B.

32:40.415 --> 32:43.417
All right, you said Novak ripped
you off for three cars, right?

32:43.746 --> 32:46.381
- Yeah.
- It's payback time.

32:48.652 --> 32:49.852
Wait. What's this?

32:49.886 --> 32:52.655
I'm not waiting around to
triangulate cell phone signals.

32:52.689 --> 32:54.170
You want a deal or not?

32:55.051 --> 32:56.151
Course.

32:56.190 --> 32:58.427
All right. You're gonna send
that picture to Novak.

32:58.462 --> 32:59.958
Tell him you got his mom.

32:59.992 --> 33:02.365
You're trading her
for the cash you fronted him.

33:03.867 --> 33:05.668
What if he hates his mom?

33:07.170 --> 33:09.005
Then we're all screwed.

33:15.031 --> 33:16.994
Keep your eyes open.

33:23.186 --> 33:25.988
Does the name Jimmy Sanguinetti

33:26.023 --> 33:27.890
mean anything to you?

33:27.924 --> 33:29.792
Yeah. What about him?

33:31.728 --> 33:33.195
Apparently he's my dad.

33:40.805 --> 33:43.339
Bunny says he's out of prison,

33:43.573 --> 33:46.075
in town, wants to reconnect.

33:51.114 --> 33:54.150
I ran into Sanguinetti a couple times.

33:54.184 --> 33:56.790
It was back when he was crashing
with your mom.

34:00.306 --> 34:02.091
I thought that you met Bunny

34:02.125 --> 34:03.859
when you pulled me off the street.

34:04.492 --> 34:06.981
I knew Bunny before you were born.

34:07.931 --> 34:10.099
Most of the young cops
in the District knew Bunny.

34:10.132 --> 34:12.168
I mean, there was always a domestic

34:12.202 --> 34:15.237
or disturbing the peace call
at her place or at her bar.

34:22.705 --> 34:24.873
Why didn't you ever tell me that?

34:26.976 --> 34:28.376
Never came up.

34:32.761 --> 34:34.757
All right, get in position.

34:53.079 --> 34:54.810
Snatching my mom?

34:54.844 --> 34:56.911
Talk about a punk move.

34:56.947 --> 34:58.414
Got your attention, didn't it?

34:58.448 --> 35:01.517
I got your money. Let me see her.

35:08.425 --> 35:10.126
CPD, asshole.

35:12.863 --> 35:14.797
Turn around.

35:15.966 --> 35:17.066
Let's go.

35:24.725 --> 35:26.332
Still nothing?

35:27.127 --> 35:28.561
No.

35:28.596 --> 35:30.697
He's not much of a talker.

35:30.731 --> 35:31.998
No.

35:32.032 --> 35:33.632
Just like mama?

35:34.635 --> 35:36.603
Yeah, well, maybe I'll just have
to go next door

35:36.637 --> 35:38.471
and make a new friend.

35:48.415 --> 35:50.783
You tell him it's his lucky day?

35:50.818 --> 35:52.807
Not yet.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.161
Go ahead and tell him.

35:55.422 --> 35:58.801
- It's your lucky day, Mike.
- Yeah. That's right.

35:59.593 --> 36:02.028
Witness says that the driver
of the Mustang

36:02.062 --> 36:03.596
plowed into that minivan...

36:03.631 --> 36:05.632
he had dark hair.

36:05.666 --> 36:08.101
That blond mop of yours might
have just saved you

36:08.135 --> 36:10.436
from vehicular homicide charges.

36:13.574 --> 36:16.843
Unless you were wearing a wig.
Were you wearing a wig?

36:20.748 --> 36:22.148
I think he was wearing a wig.

36:22.182 --> 36:23.716
I'm gonna go confirm it with Ryan.

36:23.751 --> 36:25.151
I wasn't wearing a wig.

36:25.185 --> 36:26.619
No?

36:28.255 --> 36:30.244
So, Ryan was driving?

36:31.625 --> 36:33.526
So, Ryan was driving?

36:39.633 --> 36:40.767
I'm talking to you.

36:45.039 --> 36:47.473
Yeah. Ryan was driving.

36:48.929 --> 36:50.529
How'd you get the car?

36:50.778 --> 36:52.679
Well, me and Ryan, we were all geared up

36:52.713 --> 36:54.477
waiting in our work car.

36:55.516 --> 36:58.618
We get a call from this valet
we had in our back pocket,

36:58.652 --> 37:00.687
says he tagged a classic Mustang,

37:00.721 --> 37:03.790
so we track it from Tap on Rush,
and we get behind this dude...

37:03.824 --> 37:05.085
Him?

37:09.163 --> 37:10.596
Yeah.

37:12.079 --> 37:15.268
We was gonna hit him at the next
stoplight like we usually do,

37:15.302 --> 37:18.137
but two blocks out, he pulled
off on this side street.

37:18.172 --> 37:19.806
So, there was no one else around,

37:19.840 --> 37:21.280
so we weren't gonna wait any longer,

37:21.308 --> 37:22.809
and as we're rolling up on him,

37:22.843 --> 37:24.550
he starts getting out.

37:25.846 --> 37:28.047
And dude was fumbling with his keys,

37:28.082 --> 37:30.663
so I pulled out my .45
and I said, "Hand it over,"

37:31.518 --> 37:33.647
and he looks at me
like he's gonna fight back.

37:34.221 --> 37:35.671
So, boom,

37:36.323 --> 37:37.991
I gave him a little pistol whip,

37:38.025 --> 37:39.993
he hit the ground,
and I grabbed his keys.

37:40.027 --> 37:41.527
Where'd you hit him?

37:42.807 --> 37:44.530
Right there.

37:48.035 --> 37:49.122
Then what?

37:49.603 --> 37:51.537
Ryan drove.

37:51.572 --> 37:54.507
Ryan drove the Mustang.

37:54.541 --> 37:55.834
I followed.

37:56.777 --> 37:58.221
And we were heading north on Ashland,

37:58.245 --> 38:00.246
and then just...

38:00.280 --> 38:02.582
this minivan came out of nowhere,

38:02.616 --> 38:04.210
ran a red light.

38:05.219 --> 38:07.186
Ryan smashed into it, so he bailed.

38:07.221 --> 38:09.155
He hopped into my car, and we took off.

38:09.189 --> 38:11.224
According to the report,

38:11.258 --> 38:14.761
the Mustang was going
70 miles an hour in a 35 zone,

38:14.795 --> 38:15.939
and it was the vehicle at fault,

38:15.963 --> 38:18.664
- so it was the Mustang that...
- into a minivan.

38:18.699 --> 38:21.167
The name of the driver was Elsa James.

38:21.201 --> 38:23.169
She was with her ten-year-old daughter.

38:23.203 --> 38:25.071
Her name was Chloe.

38:25.442 --> 38:27.273
And you killed her.

38:27.307 --> 38:29.742
No. Ryan did.

38:29.777 --> 38:31.636
I wasn't driving.

38:32.579 --> 38:34.147
Remember?

38:37.818 --> 38:41.054
Mike Cox just confessed
to carjacking Severide.

38:41.088 --> 38:43.256
Only says he wasn't doing the driving.

38:43.290 --> 38:44.257
Ryan Novak was.

38:44.291 --> 38:47.060
Even if that's true,
Cox can still be charged

38:47.094 --> 38:48.605
as an accomplice to vehicular homicide

38:48.629 --> 38:49.729
and face the same charges.

38:49.763 --> 38:51.564
Fine with me. What about Severide?

38:51.598 --> 38:53.309
I already made the call.
He'll be released soon.

38:53.333 --> 38:54.859
Good...

38:55.602 --> 38:57.270
Novak might say something

38:57.304 --> 38:59.072
about us sticking his mom in the trunk.

38:59.106 --> 39:02.275
Hank, I've heard enough.
I got it from here.

39:26.300 --> 39:27.333
Hey.

39:27.367 --> 39:28.898
Hey.

39:31.638 --> 39:32.816
Try to keep your feelings out of it

39:32.840 --> 39:34.373
when it comes to the interviews.

39:36.310 --> 39:38.490
Okay. Done.

39:39.279 --> 39:41.614
Anything else? Because I'm 100% open

39:41.648 --> 39:43.883
to any advice or suggestions
or criticism.

39:46.320 --> 39:50.088
Okay, um, tell me, Kim:

39:50.898 --> 39:53.795
Out of 13,000 other coppers,

39:54.828 --> 39:56.896
why do you think you deserve
to be up here?

39:59.466 --> 40:01.342
I've paid my dues.

40:01.869 --> 40:05.341
I've been shot, run over,
almost lost my partner,

40:05.839 --> 40:08.951
and I've... I've arrested more people

40:08.985 --> 40:11.811
than most police officers
combined in this district, so.

40:11.845 --> 40:13.713
See, you know, that's the thing.

40:13.747 --> 40:15.740
Real police... they don't boast

40:16.250 --> 40:18.251
or expect any medals
pinned to their chest.

40:21.180 --> 40:22.788
- You asked.
- Yeah.

40:22.823 --> 40:26.473
Well, you know, between Ruzek and Roman,

40:28.095 --> 40:30.163
you've been a badge bunny,

40:30.197 --> 40:35.268
so I don't know if you're
tough enough for Intelligence.

40:39.054 --> 40:41.107
Well, then get ready
to eat some crow, Al.

41:07.234 --> 41:08.801
How are you?

41:11.471 --> 41:13.239
Better now that you're here.

41:18.029 --> 41:21.410
The fact that I was in that car
for even two blocks...

41:22.629 --> 41:24.549
I got to get my act together.

41:25.702 --> 41:28.187
Well, however I can help.

41:30.224 --> 41:32.225
Catch the guys that did this?

41:32.580 --> 41:34.293
Yeah. They're shipping
down here right now

41:34.328 --> 41:35.858
to take your place.

41:36.684 --> 41:38.531
How old was the girl...

41:39.179 --> 41:40.765
who died?

41:41.268 --> 41:42.935
She was ten.

41:49.443 --> 41:51.510
Thank you for believing in me.

41:56.283 --> 41:57.917
Hey.
