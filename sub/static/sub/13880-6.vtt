Welcome to paradise.

00:20.863 --> 00:22.461
Now, leave all your worries

00:22.461 --> 00:25.559
and other TV shows behind, baby.

00:26.639 --> 00:29.277
It's time
for "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:29.277 --> 00:30.477
Frylock: "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:30.477 --> 00:31.743
Shake: "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:31.743 --> 00:32.776
Meatwad: "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:32.776 --> 00:34.608
I said "Aqua TV Show Show."

Frylock: "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:35.773 --> 00:36.839
Shake: "Aqua TV Show Show."

Meatwad: "Aqua TV Show Show."

01:14.711 --> 01:16.277
One, two. One, two.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.541
Need a little more
from this right monitor, please.

01:18.541 --> 01:20.506
Need the sound of my voice!

01:20.506 --> 01:22.172
Yeah, that's good. That's good!

01:23.437 --> 01:25.070
Kazoo solo!

01:29.499 --> 01:30.699
Meatwad on trombone!

01:34.828 --> 01:36.727
And here comes the fiddle!

01:38.859 --> 01:42.357
Frylock, I said,
"Here comes the fiddle!"

01:42.357 --> 01:43.389
Meatwad: He bounced.

01:43.389 --> 01:44.488
Shake: Is he out of his mind?!

01:44.488 --> 01:45.820
We're about to get psyched here!

01:45.820 --> 01:47.086
You see this crowd?!

01:47.086 --> 01:48.752
I dare not offend you,
fair brother,

01:48.752 --> 01:51.550
but it's called a drum circle,
not a jerk circle.

01:51.550 --> 01:53.648
Shake: Well,
how do I get way into this?

01:53.648 --> 01:55.713
Oh, come over
to my humble market.

01:55.713 --> 01:59.310
I will --
I will show you the way.

01:59.310 --> 02:00.409
Follow my lead.

02:00.409 --> 02:01.608
2, 3, 7.

02:01.608 --> 02:03.674
Fingers, then palm,
palm, fingers,

02:03.674 --> 02:07.538
palm, back of palm,
front of palm, fingertips,

02:07.538 --> 02:09.669
finger backage, palm, fingers.

02:09.669 --> 02:12.300
Shake: Palm, palm, fingers.
The palm, palm, fingers.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.533
You got it! Yes, you got it!

02:13.533 --> 02:16.297
It's like the call
of the tribesmen

02:16.297 --> 02:17.730
across the Savanna.

02:17.730 --> 02:19.429
Shake:
It's like Neil Peart in rush!

02:19.429 --> 02:20.694
Palm, palm, fingers!

02:20.694 --> 02:22.392
Yeah, I'm gonna join the circle!

02:22.392 --> 02:24.225
No, hold on, bro. That's a --

02:24.225 --> 02:27.522
that's a $200
authentic Wabosabi bongo.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.521
Shake:
Yeah, and it plays like one!

02:29.521 --> 02:31.785
No, I need some renumeration,
my friend.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.550
Shake: I thought you guys
were, like, all natural

02:34.550 --> 02:36.149
and used leaves for money

02:36.149 --> 02:38.614
and a hug-based
currency system, man.

02:38.614 --> 02:42.077
We do, but sometimes
we like $200 in cash.

02:42.077 --> 02:45.609
Shake: How 'bout...$80?
Will that do it?

02:46.708 --> 02:49.106
Hippies. G-- all right.

02:49.106 --> 02:51.937
We'll do $80 down,
10.9% interest monthly.

02:51.937 --> 02:54.435
Use this card, and you can get
instant sandal points.

02:54.435 --> 02:56.633
Shake: All right.
500 sandal points.

02:56.633 --> 02:57.600
What do I get with that?

02:57.600 --> 02:58.732
Get yourself a frisbee

02:58.732 --> 03:01.263
with a certain leaf
imprinted on it.

03:02.529 --> 03:05.394
Shake: Yeah! Get off, man!

03:05.394 --> 03:07.525
Throw down!

03:07.525 --> 03:09.524
Skin!

03:17.884 --> 03:19.749
Skin!

03:20.948 --> 03:21.781
Shake: Frylock!

03:21.781 --> 03:23.446
Then I play the rhythm,

03:23.446 --> 03:24.679
and this freaking creature

03:24.679 --> 03:25.744
appears out of nowhere,

03:25.744 --> 03:28.542
and he's crying,
"My skin! My skin!"

03:28.542 --> 03:29.741
- Frylock: Prove it.
- Shake: I will!

03:29.741 --> 03:31.007
This happened to me.

03:31.007 --> 03:33.239
You just have
the gun ready, okay?

03:35.437 --> 03:37.702
- My skin!
- Shake: Shoot it in the face!

03:37.702 --> 03:39.034
Frylock: Okay, okay.
Stop playing. Stop playing, man.

03:39.034 --> 03:40.700
Okay, I believe you.
I believe you.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.266
What the hell was that thing?!

03:42.266 --> 03:43.498
Shake: Rhythm created it

03:43.498 --> 03:45.929
from probably my magic playing,

03:45.929 --> 03:47.695
like in the -- "The matrixes,"

03:47.695 --> 03:51.359
when you see
the numbers everywhere.

03:51.359 --> 03:52.591
Well, I'm actually the one.

03:52.591 --> 03:53.723
Frylock: Meatwad, you do it.

03:53.723 --> 03:56.188
Meatwad:
Let me turn this beat around.

04:01.317 --> 04:02.716
Shake:
It's supposed to be palm, palm,

04:02.716 --> 04:05.448
finger, palm, palm, finger!

04:05.448 --> 04:06.913
- Aaah!
- Shake: Shoot it in the face!

04:06.913 --> 04:09.878
- Frylock: Okay, okay.
- Shake: No, I'm the one!

04:09.878 --> 04:11.310
Frylock: You need to take
these bongos back.

04:11.310 --> 04:13.175
Carl: Hey, dumb-ass patrol,

04:13.175 --> 04:16.206
how 'bout you stick
your palm, palm, finger
in this freakin' hole?!

04:16.206 --> 04:19.204
'cause I'm in the middle
of my water aerobics.

04:20.503 --> 04:22.036
Oh, well, hello, friends.

04:22.036 --> 04:24.999
Per chance I could sell you
and your red friend a dugout

04:24.999 --> 04:27.864
or some clove cigarettes
to breathe in from and on

04:27.864 --> 04:31.029
and exhale onto this glorious
day on earth, mother earth?

04:31.029 --> 04:32.561
Frylock: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We want to return this bongo

04:32.561 --> 04:33.627
for a full refund.

04:33.627 --> 04:35.226
I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

04:35.226 --> 04:38.223
It's not our corporate policy
to accept returns.

04:38.223 --> 04:39.422
Frylock: Corporate policy?

04:39.422 --> 04:40.921
This is a camper van, man.

04:40.921 --> 04:42.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:44.152 --> 04:45.251
Let's breathe deep, brother.

04:45.251 --> 04:46.583
Shake:
Come on, Frylock. Be cool.

04:46.583 --> 04:48.581
I don't want to lose
instant sandal points.

04:48.581 --> 04:50.180
Frylock:
When we play these drums,

04:50.180 --> 04:51.213
a creature comes out of nowhere,

04:51.213 --> 04:52.346
wanting our skin.

04:52.346 --> 04:53.478
Ohh! I don't know
what that's about!

04:53.478 --> 04:54.911
Frylock: All right, fine. Fine.

04:54.911 --> 04:56.276
You want to see how it works?
Sit back and watch.

04:57.509 --> 04:58.574
No, please!

04:58.574 --> 04:59.707
Don't play the drum.

04:59.707 --> 05:01.306
It's the Wabosabis.

05:01.306 --> 05:02.671
- Frylock: Wabo-what?
- Wabosabis.

05:02.671 --> 05:04.636
They're ghosts from space,

05:04.636 --> 05:06.868
and they've come back
to retrieve their skin.

05:06.868 --> 05:08.334
Frylock: Retrieve?
Wait a minute, man.

05:08.334 --> 05:09.466
What do you mean?

05:09.466 --> 05:11.398
Why would they want
their skin back?

05:11.398 --> 05:14.529
Because I-I-I may have
torn it off

05:14.529 --> 05:16.228
and used it on some drums.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.493
- Frylock: What?!
- Look, when they came to me,

05:18.493 --> 05:19.658
I was stoned.

05:19.658 --> 05:22.524
I was super, super stoned.

05:22.524 --> 05:25.554
I thought this is nothing
but a beautiful daydream,

05:25.554 --> 05:28.786
a reverie that this majestic
purple dancer --

05:28.786 --> 05:31.484
you should have seen it. It was
this perfect image of peace,

05:31.484 --> 05:33.515
making love
with this purple woman

05:33.515 --> 05:37.280
through this enormous,
purple, girthy Peter,

05:37.280 --> 05:39.178
and there was purple children

05:39.178 --> 05:40.410
living off the land in harmony,

05:40.410 --> 05:43.775
so I --
so I slaughtered them and...

05:43.775 --> 05:45.473
Oh, harsh, dude!

05:45.473 --> 05:48.271
...like the ancient Iroquois
with the buffalo,

05:48.271 --> 05:49.736
well, I used every part --

05:49.736 --> 05:52.468
I mean, the skin for the drums
and the skulls

05:52.468 --> 05:54.100
for tobacco bongs
and vaporizers,

05:54.100 --> 05:58.863
and the soft, velvety Wabosabi
scrotum is just -- ohh!

05:58.863 --> 06:00.862
Makes a perfect hacky-sack.
I got to be honest with you.

06:00.862 --> 06:03.460
Meatwad: But ain't you hippies
like a vegan?

06:03.460 --> 06:06.091
Well, look, it doesn't count
if they're from space.

06:06.091 --> 06:07.657
I mean, it's space.
It's not here.

06:07.657 --> 06:09.721
Shake:
Let me tell you something.

06:09.721 --> 06:12.153
I'm super grossed out
that I put my hand on that.

06:12.153 --> 06:14.717
- I hope that wasn't butt skin.
- Frylock: That's not our point.

06:14.717 --> 06:16.183
Shake: I don't even
want to know why all them

06:16.183 --> 06:17.749
curly little hairs
came off of it.

06:17.749 --> 06:19.947
Frylock: Our point is you'll
never get away with it.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.012
What are you gonna do?

06:21.012 --> 06:23.445
Are you gonna call
the space police, red man?

06:23.445 --> 06:26.542
I control
a multinational conglomerate

06:26.542 --> 06:28.407
of patchouli peddlers.

06:28.407 --> 06:33.837
I have thousands of these
rusted RVs around the globe,

06:33.837 --> 06:35.968
and if you try
to stand in my way,

06:35.968 --> 06:37.967
you're gonna get crushed --

06:37.967 --> 06:39.732
under my unwashed, bare feet.

06:39.732 --> 06:43.030
Shake: Oh, yeah?!
Well, what you did is wrong!

06:43.030 --> 06:44.961
Frylock: That's right,
and we're gonna get organized

06:44.961 --> 06:47.992
and we're gonna host a benefit
on behalf of the Wabosabi!

06:47.992 --> 06:51.024
Shake: You know, I was totally
done after I yelled at him.

06:51.024 --> 06:52.156
I had full closure.

06:52.156 --> 06:54.087
You know that, right?
I was done.

06:56.020 --> 06:57.119
Stop the rhythm!

06:57.119 --> 06:58.951
Stop the rhythm at once!

06:58.951 --> 07:00.516
But the beat -- I thought it --

07:00.516 --> 07:02.248
Shake: I know. I know. Goes on.

07:02.248 --> 07:04.513
But this is not what you think!
Look.

07:06.645 --> 07:08.310
My skin!

07:08.310 --> 07:11.308
- I see it.
- Whoa! I see it, too.

07:11.308 --> 07:13.073
I'm pretty sure I see it.

07:13.073 --> 07:15.205
This thing, star shower,
not that thing.

07:15.205 --> 07:17.437
Oh, yeah. I see that, too.

07:18.836 --> 07:20.434
You're all hallucinating, guys.
It's --

07:20.434 --> 07:23.165
- Shake: He's lying!
- Got hold of a bad tab,
I guess.

07:23.165 --> 07:25.697
Shake: The drum is made
of Wabosabi skin,

07:25.697 --> 07:28.395
and the bongo king is harvesting
these purple space creatures

07:28.395 --> 07:30.793
to make his homemade
hippie drums!

07:30.793 --> 07:35.356
He castrates them and sells
their glands as hacky-sacks!

07:35.356 --> 07:38.221
- Balls?
- Balls from space! Nice!

07:38.221 --> 07:40.352
But -- but -- but listen.
The Wabosabis

07:40.352 --> 07:42.984
are a renewable resource,
I remind you.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.683
Shake: Because he breeds them

07:44.683 --> 07:48.846
so he can turn Wabosabi
baby spines into devil sticks!

07:48.846 --> 07:50.379
Babies have spines?

07:50.379 --> 07:52.043
Shake: He's a capitalist pig,

07:52.043 --> 07:55.408
and I have a petition
going around to raise awareness.

07:55.408 --> 08:00.604
And I'm not moving until
the bongo king is behind bars!

08:00.604 --> 08:02.435
Aah! Ohh! Ohh!

08:02.435 --> 08:04.834
You got to have a permit
to be here. Seize him!

08:04.834 --> 08:06.632
Shake: Yo, it's the cops!
That's not cool!

08:06.632 --> 08:10.264
Ahh! Somebody play my drum!
Ohh! Ahh!

08:10.264 --> 08:14.027
Keep the spirit
of the Wabosabi alive!

08:14.027 --> 08:15.126
Keep the Wabosabi alive, man!

08:15.126 --> 08:18.457
More Wabosabis
all the time, man!

08:18.457 --> 08:20.356
Frylock:
Damn, Shake. I've never seen you

08:20.356 --> 08:21.955
get so passionate
about something.

08:21.955 --> 08:23.320
Shake: I know. I'm deep.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.452
I am an ocean of emotion,

08:25.452 --> 08:27.184
and when I care about something,

08:27.184 --> 08:28.683
I let people know to look at me,

08:28.683 --> 08:31.281
and then I get
paid attention to.

08:31.281 --> 08:32.679
Frylock: Well, you've certainly
become the loudest voice

08:32.679 --> 08:34.378
for the Wabosabi movement.
I'll give you that.

08:34.378 --> 08:35.744
- Shake: You're welcome!
- Frylock: How do you plan

08:35.744 --> 08:37.342
on getting them off
our front lawn?

08:38.908 --> 08:41.405
Carl: Attention, greasy, dirty,

08:41.405 --> 08:44.270
stupid, long-hair wackadoos!

08:44.270 --> 08:47.401
Shut down
your freaking jungle music!

08:47.401 --> 08:50.833
The milkshake, dude,
with the straw!

08:50.833 --> 08:52.198
Shake: Thank you! Thank you!

08:52.198 --> 08:55.795
My album will drop
sometime in August!

08:55.795 --> 09:00.625
Now, has anyone seen the spirit
of the Wabosabi people?!

09:00.625 --> 09:03.423
I think he's inside,
watching TV.

09:03.423 --> 09:05.088
Shake: Oh, is that right?

09:05.088 --> 09:06.154
He's watching that show
where they spoil

09:06.154 --> 09:07.820
all the magic tricks.

09:07.820 --> 09:09.252
He loves your TV, man.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.182
"Celebrity badminton."

09:13.182 --> 09:14.281
Shake: Hey! Hey!

09:14.281 --> 09:16.879
You have any idea
how stupid I look,

09:16.879 --> 09:17.945
going to jail for you?!

09:17.945 --> 09:20.310
I'm out there talking about
how barbaric he was

09:20.310 --> 09:21.742
with your scrotum,

09:21.742 --> 09:24.240
and you're at the freaking mall,
getting it pierced!

09:24.240 --> 09:25.972
I think it's infected.

09:25.972 --> 09:27.538
Hack attack.

09:27.538 --> 09:29.903
Shake: I am not touching that
with my foot again!

09:29.903 --> 09:35.765
Shake, I appreciate what you've
done for me and my people,

09:35.765 --> 09:37.064
but now I want money.

09:37.064 --> 09:38.597
Shake:
I thought you live off the land!

09:38.597 --> 09:42.160
My new cellphone plan
is more than I expected to pay.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.859
Shake: You got a
freaking cellphone?!

09:43.859 --> 09:45.058
Hell, yeah.

09:45.058 --> 09:47.090
Shake: You've been denied
multiple times!

09:47.090 --> 09:49.221
Carl: I told you people
to shut it down!

09:49.221 --> 09:51.952
This is what you get
when you don't listen!

09:51.952 --> 09:54.218
Losing rhythm!

09:54.218 --> 09:58.082
Shake: That's right.
Meatwad, get your golden ax.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.843
And here comes the fiddle!

10:08.939 --> 10:12.936
Yeah! Music isn't about freedom
or feeling the rhythm.

10:12.936 --> 10:15.002
It's about loose women

10:15.002 --> 10:16.801
and raking in the jack.

10:16.801 --> 10:19.199
Both: ♪ Camptown
ladies, sing this song ♪

10:19.199 --> 10:20.797
♪ Doo-da, doo-da ♪

10:20.797 --> 10:23.029
♪ Camptown racetrack
5 miles long ♪

10:23.029 --> 10:24.195
♪ Oh, da-doo-da day ♪

10:24.195 --> 10:26.326
Carl: Yeah! Doo-da!

10:26.326 --> 10:28.092
Doo-da your face off!

10:28.092 --> 10:29.291
Yeah, hey. Uh, I noticed

10:29.291 --> 10:31.656
this isn't Def Leppard,
like we discussed.

10:31.656 --> 10:33.655
Carl: Yeah, well, I notice
all these chocolate candies

10:33.655 --> 10:35.686
ain't green
like we discussed, neithers.

10:35.686 --> 10:37.984
"Photograph,"
"Pour some sugar on me,"

10:37.984 --> 10:38.984
"Rock of ages" --

10:38.984 --> 10:41.182
you promised me those songs.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.148
Carl: Hey, they don't want
to blow their wad

10:43.148 --> 10:45.911
with all the good songs.
They want to ease into it

10:45.911 --> 10:48.444
with the new stuff. Yeah!

10:48.444 --> 10:50.542
Shake: ♪ Doo-da, doo-da ♪

10:50.542 --> 10:52.740
And -- and I guess
this is how Def Leppard

10:52.740 --> 10:53.706
spells their name now.

10:53.706 --> 10:55.171
Carl: Yeah, Def Lepp

10:55.171 --> 10:57.736
That's the original lineup, too,

10:57.736 --> 10:59.235
before the drummer lost his arm.

10:59.235 --> 11:01.000
He's better.
He's got two in this one.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.165
Both: ♪ Oh, da-doo-da-day ♪

11:04.305 --> 11:10.353
