00:02.001 --> 00:06.291
Goku was facing imminent death.

00:06.382 --> 00:10.591
Surprisingly, the one who saved him was Yajirobe.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.919
As Gohan offered his resistance,

00:13.013 --> 00:17.052
their last hope was entrusted to Kuririn.

00:18.602 --> 00:21.810
Kuririn... hit him with it...

00:21.897 --> 00:25.139
A-AII right. I'll try.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.541
How strong he is...!

02:08.628 --> 02:13.464
He should be fairly worn out
from fighting Father, too...

02:31.068 --> 02:36.028
He's quite the little runt, but he
seems to be just about at his limit.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.704
Masenko!!

02:49.795 --> 02:52.878
Ha! Is this your last-ditch defiance?!

02:55.300 --> 02:57.382
Rats!

02:59.847 --> 03:02.634
One more!

03:10.190 --> 03:12.567
Damn... With him moving around like that,

03:12.651 --> 03:15.313
I don't have the skill it takes to hit him.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.947
You don't aim the Genki Dama using your eyes.

03:20.033 --> 03:24.072
You feel out the evil of his Ki, and then launch it.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.993
W-Who's there?!

03:26.081 --> 03:30.700
I am Kaio, the one who taught Son Goku
how to use the Genki Dama.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.456
K-Kaio-sama...?

03:33.547 --> 03:36.664
Everything will be determined by your one shot.

03:36.758 --> 03:42.628
Know that the hopes of all the Earth
are placed in that Genki Dama.

03:42.723 --> 03:47.808
T-The hopes of all the Earth are placed in here?

03:55.903 --> 03:58.770
No matter how many of you scum team up,

03:58.864 --> 04:02.607
you're still no match for an elite like me!

04:04.494 --> 04:08.828
Once you realized that, it was already too late!

04:13.754 --> 04:19.841
Feel out the evil of his Ki, then launch. | get it.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.838
Kuririn... I'm counting on you...

04:21.928 --> 04:25.012
You will only get one chance with this.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.768
I'm through playing around.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.709
Can you get away from this?!

04:56.797 --> 05:01.882
F-Feel it! Feel the evil of his Ki!

05:12.562 --> 05:16.805
He's fixin' to do somethin', huh?
That's a huge wad of Ki.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.812
Well, if yer gonna do it, do it already!

05:30.247 --> 05:35.992
Watch this closely, Kakarrot!
This is the end of your foolish son!

05:37.087 --> 05:38.167
I've got it!

05:38.255 --> 05:43.090
What're ya doin', dumbass?!
Hurry up an' chuck that thing!

05:43.176 --> 05:46.384
That idiot! Damn it all!

05:52.936 --> 05:55.348
W-What is that?!

05:55.439 --> 05:57.725
Hit him!

05:59.901 --> 06:01.857
It missed!

06:07.534 --> 06:09.900
It's hopeless now!

06:11.580 --> 06:15.038
Bounce it back, Gohan!

06:15.125 --> 06:17.241
Gohan, that thing is friendly fire!

06:17.335 --> 06:21.453
If you ain't got any evil in you,
you should be able to repel it!

07:05.592 --> 07:08.379
They did it!

07:08.470 --> 07:10.176
Yahoo!

07:10.263 --> 07:12.754
We did it!

07:12.849 --> 07:16.433
We did it! We did it, Goku!

07:16.520 --> 07:21.389
Thank goodness! Goku!
We did it! We did it! We did it!

07:31.576 --> 07:33.988
You guys finally did it, huh?

07:34.079 --> 07:35.740
Mm-hmm.

07:35.831 --> 07:39.164
I thought we'd had it, time and again, there.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.367
You guys have both been run ragged.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.043
Not as badly as you've been.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.101
T-The Saiyan...

08:07.195 --> 08:09.902
It's okay. He's dead.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.988
Damn you. You were one hell of a beast,

08:19.082 --> 08:21.789
but I guess we should at least dig a grave.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.752
You mean a grave for yourselves?!

08:32.554 --> 08:38.549
T-T-That's impossible! He took
that Genki Dama dead-on!

08:44.065 --> 08:47.432
You've gone and done quite a number on me.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.736
Even I thought I was going to die from that one.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.406
l-l've taken a considerable amount of damage,

08:58.496 --> 09:02.956
but I still have enough strength
to take care of trash like you.

09:10.175 --> 09:13.463
Once I've killed you all,
I'll wait and recover my strength,

09:13.553 --> 09:17.216
then completely destroy this planet!

09:24.689 --> 09:33.734
Y-You've made me, Vegeta, use up
nearly the full limit of my power.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.612
And though it may have taken
a number of you to do it,

09:38.703 --> 09:43.117
it wounds my pride that
trash like you have done this.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.826
Would you people drop dead already?!

09:48.964 --> 09:55.005
D-Damn it... Damn it...!

09:55.095 --> 09:57.427
G-Goku!

11:11.504 --> 11:16.544
D-Damn it, l have to admit,
that destructive force was pathetic.

11:16.634 --> 11:20.547
All three of them are still clinging to life.

11:34.944 --> 11:38.072
T-The damage was worse than I thought...

11:38.156 --> 11:41.239
|-| have to hurry up and take care of these guys...

11:41.326 --> 11:43.863
...and then get some rest...

12:01.054 --> 12:04.672
T-The little brat!

12:04.766 --> 12:09.226
His tail has grown back!

12:09.312 --> 12:12.429
H-His tail? Oh, yeah.

12:12.524 --> 12:16.142
Way back when, Goku's tail
also grew back all of a sudden.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.492
Oh, crap!

12:31.793 --> 12:35.285
If he were to transform
on me, it would be trouble.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.258
W-What?!

13:10.206 --> 13:13.790
I done it! I done it!

13:13.877 --> 13:16.960
Serves ya right, you jackass!

13:17.046 --> 13:19.879
Nyah-hah-hah-hah!

13:19.966 --> 13:27.054
How d'ya like that?! Yer no match
for Yajirobe! Nyah-hah-hah!

13:32.604 --> 13:34.515
Why, you...

13:34.606 --> 13:37.643
You filthy bastard!

13:50.330 --> 13:56.496
S-S-Sorry! Did that hurt? H was
just kiddin' around! Did I cut ya?

13:56.586 --> 14:02.081
Yeah! I got lotsa respect for you.
L-Let's you an' I be buds--

14:23.404 --> 14:27.192
Y-Yajirobe...

14:27.283 --> 14:34.030
Nobody, and I mean nobody
wounds me and gets away with it!

14:34.123 --> 14:36.375
D-Damn it...

14:37.794 --> 14:42.037
G-Gohan!

14:42.131 --> 14:44.873
Gohan!

14:44.968 --> 14:48.460
T-That's Father's voice...

14:50.974 --> 14:55.764
G-Gohan, listen to me...

14:55.853 --> 14:57.434
Mm-hmm...

14:57.522 --> 15:01.515
Look at the ball of light in the sky...

15:01.609 --> 15:07.024
B-Ball of light...? Ball of light...?

15:22.672 --> 15:25.960
O-Oh, no! I won't let that happen!

15:26.050 --> 15:27.961
Die!

15:30.722 --> 15:32.553
Oh, crap!

15:37.145 --> 15:40.729
Y-You little brat! I'm not
about to let you grow huge!

15:43.735 --> 15:46.351
Damn!

15:46.446 --> 15:48.607
l have to kill him, now, while I can!

15:48.698 --> 15:51.815
G-Gohan, it's up to you...!

15:51.909 --> 15:57.199
G-Gohan is turning Great Ape...
It's an all-or-nothing gamble...

15:57.290 --> 15:59.201
T-That's right, his tail!

15:59.292 --> 16:01.908
l was in such a rush, I forgot
the most important thing!

16:02.003 --> 16:04.119
If I can just cut off his tail...

16:38.790 --> 16:40.280
Gohan...

16:40.375 --> 16:41.330
Then again,

16:41.417 --> 16:45.956
when Goku became a Great Ape,
he had no trace of rationality.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.753
What about Gohan...?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.048
Gohan is the same way!

16:54.138 --> 16:58.177
R-Right, it's not so much that
Goku and Gohan lose their rationality,

16:58.267 --> 16:59.677
as it is that when they turn Great Ape,

16:59.769 --> 17:02.385
they revert to being violent Saiyans!

17:10.405 --> 17:13.896
Wah! Stay away!

17:13.991 --> 17:16.573
Gohan!

17:17.787 --> 17:19.367
Gohan!

17:21.665 --> 17:26.751
G-Gohan!

17:27.797 --> 17:31.585
G-Gohan! The Saiyan!

17:31.676 --> 17:34.167
Get the Saiyan!

17:41.728 --> 17:44.640
W-Why, that...

17:44.731 --> 17:47.222
Gohan!

17:53.823 --> 17:57.987
Good! A small part of Gohan's
mind still remains in there.

17:58.077 --> 18:02.446
S-Sure, he's half earthling, after all.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.340
The moon I created won't
go out for another hour.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.008
Sure enough, my only choice is to cut off his tail!

18:49.962 --> 18:54.376
D-Damn! My power...!

18:54.467 --> 18:57.379
Damn it!

19:05.645 --> 19:07.852
I can't move!

19:22.036 --> 19:24.823
W-What happened?

19:33.923 --> 19:35.754
Did he get him?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.609
H-He's still alive?

20:03.703 --> 20:06.319
What is that?

20:06.414 --> 20:08.370
There it is...

20:20.720 --> 20:25.589
To think that I'd have to retreat...

20:30.271 --> 20:33.855
D-Damn it, |, Vegeta,

20:33.941 --> 20:38.105
said to be the mightiest
warrior in the universe...

20:39.614 --> 20:43.277
T-That's his spaceship.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.029
Like hell you're getting away!

20:59.300 --> 21:02.007
We've come this far...

21:02.094 --> 21:04.551
Now I'm gonna finish the job.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.264
Hold it!

21:17.360 --> 21:21.353
This is for everyone you've killed!

21:21.447 --> 21:23.358
Say your prayers!

21:23.449 --> 21:26.816
Damn it, my body won't respond...!

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yaburekabure omoikiri

22:36.230 --> 22:39.768
Kuririn, Gohan, way to make it this far.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.724
Everyone else got killed, though.

22:41.819 --> 22:45.653
With Piccolo-san dead, Kami-sama is gone, too.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.231
But then, if my idea is correct,

22:48.325 --> 22:50.702
we might be able to obtain some Dragon Balls.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.697
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:52.788 --> 22:56.497
“Dawn ofa Fierce Battle... The Star
of Hope is Piccolo 's Homeland. ”

22:56.584 --> 22:59.951
So where is Planet Namek?
