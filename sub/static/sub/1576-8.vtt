00:02.135 --> 00:03.836
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

00:03.838 --> 00:05.137
Okay.

00:05.139 --> 00:06.638
Hold up your gifts.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.507
Everybody has to see the gold
and frankincense and myrrh

00:08.509 --> 00:09.942
So they know
we're the three wise men.

00:09.944 --> 00:12.644
It's 88 degrees out.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.046
I don't have any myrrh.

00:14.048 --> 00:17.516
Unless it's the biblical term
for "swamp ass."

00:17.518 --> 00:18.884
We want this
to be mantel-worthy.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.620
We want people to say, you know,
"look at those costumes,

00:21.622 --> 00:23.689
"look at that view,
look at cher's house

00:23.691 --> 00:26.058
Perfectly positioned
over alan's right shoulder."

00:26.060 --> 00:28.527
Oh, it's got to be
better than last year.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.697
Me as joseph,
berta as the virgin mary

00:31.699 --> 00:33.866
Looking down at you in a diaper.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.901
People loved that.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.803
Okay, here we go.

00:37.805 --> 00:38.971
(camera beeps)

00:38.973 --> 00:41.340
Now everybody say...

00:41.342 --> 00:43.342
Sweet baby jesus!

00:43.344 --> 00:45.511
Sweet baby jesus!

00:45.513 --> 00:46.812
Sorry about that.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.180
Oh, that's so cute.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.115
You guys are dressed
as duck dynasty.

00:51.584 --> 00:53.986
No. We're the three kings
of bethlehem.

00:53.988 --> 00:55.721
Oh, right.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.556
I don't get hbo.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.992
Guys, look at him.

00:59.994 --> 01:04.696
Isn't he the cutest
in his little robe and beard?

01:04.698 --> 01:06.732
You want my gold?

01:06.734 --> 01:08.700
Women:
Oh!

01:08.702 --> 01:11.770
First cute girl he meets, he's
already giving away his money.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.041
You know, I think I have a
better idea for a holiday card.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.509
(camera clicks)

01:17.511 --> 01:19.511
(to "jingle bells"):
â™ª men-men-men, men-men-men

01:19.513 --> 01:21.580
â™ª men-men-men, men-men.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.948
(bells jingling)
â™ª men, men, men, men

01:22.950 --> 01:24.516
â™ª manly men, men, men

01:24.518 --> 01:26.785
â™ª ah.
â™ª men.
â™ª men.

01:31.224 --> 01:32.791
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

01:32.793 --> 01:34.426
I found
the fake snow!

01:34.428 --> 01:36.128
Oh.

01:37.363 --> 01:38.630
It looks real.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.399
Yeah. I love a white christmas.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.567
So did charlie.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.303
He used to put snow
on every mirror in the house.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.405
Okay.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.107
Hey, hey, buddy, why
don't you go inside

01:48.109 --> 01:49.641
And write your letter to santa?

01:49.643 --> 01:51.143
Santa's not real.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.277
What?

01:52.279 --> 01:54.213
Of course he is.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.715
He's never brought me
anything I asked for.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.250
Hey, I am sure

01:58.252 --> 02:01.086
That santa's gonna come through
for you this year, buddy.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.322
That's what grown-ups
always say.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.959
Come inside with me.

02:06.961 --> 02:10.596
I made gingerbread zippys.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.798
I was gonna make
gingerbread houses,

02:12.800 --> 02:15.367
But everybody knows
zippys don't have houses.

02:18.271 --> 02:21.306
A six-year-old boy
who doesn't believe in santa.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.308
How sad is that?

02:23.310 --> 02:26.345
Almost as sad as my
20-year-old boy who does.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.980
This sucks.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.449
Just 'cause he grew up
in a group home doesn't mean

02:30.451 --> 02:32.451
That he can't enjoy
the magic of christmas.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.820
I know. It was always
jake's favorite holiday.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.421
Especially the year he turned 13

02:36.423 --> 02:38.323
And got his first
christmas boner.

02:39.459 --> 02:42.294
It was the only toy
he played with all day.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.663
Hey, you know,
I bet louis would believe

02:44.665 --> 02:46.798
If we got him
exactly what he wanted.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.300
I don't know what he wants.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.635
Rose:
He wants a bike.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.670
God! Rose.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.872
What are you
doing here?

02:53.874 --> 02:55.474
Wait. How do you know
about louis?

02:55.476 --> 02:58.343
Oh, walden, you're so adorable.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.946
I just wanted to bring by
my homemade christmas candies.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.581
Do you like nuts?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.818
Covered in chocolate, yes.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.820
With a sweater and skirt, no.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.822
Oh. Okay.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.959
On this day, walden's heart
shrank three sizes.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.327
Anyway,

03:15.329 --> 03:17.462
I know this time of year
can get busy,

03:17.464 --> 03:19.565
So if you need a helping hand,
I'm here.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.701
I can wrap presents or babysit
or read a christmas story.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.536
I'm great at doing voices.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.638
Or hearing them.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.407
What do you want, rose?

03:28.409 --> 03:31.009
My dna, my fingerprints,
a lock of my hair?

03:31.011 --> 03:32.477
No, silly.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.346
I have all that.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.014
I want to be your friend again.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.583
I don't think
that I'm comfortable

03:37.585 --> 03:39.518
With you being around louis.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.353
Or me.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.655
If you want to hang out
with alan, that's fine.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.226
I'll pass.

03:48.494 --> 03:50.395
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

03:50.397 --> 03:54.433
Here you go-- a little
christmas cheer for everyone.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.536
Ugh! What is this?

03:57.538 --> 03:58.437
It's eggnog.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.272
With no rum!

04:01.407 --> 04:04.109
Eggnog without booze
is as boring and bland

04:04.111 --> 04:06.178
As church without booze.

04:08.514 --> 04:12.217
Be a dear and go get some
rum for your grandmother.

04:12.219 --> 04:15.454
Evelyn, he's six years old.

04:15.456 --> 04:18.023
Oh. Yes, right.

04:18.025 --> 04:21.927
The rum is in a bottle
with a pirate on it.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.597
Maybe-maybe we can wait
until louis goes to bed.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.599
Of course.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.234
So run along to bed, dear.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.402
Mom.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.738
If you don't go to sleep,
santa won't come.

04:32.740 --> 04:33.872
There is no santa.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.941
What?! Of course there is.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.410
Santa's as real
as the nose on my face.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.745
(clears throat)

04:39.747 --> 04:43.515
Well, he's as real as my...

04:45.652 --> 04:47.953
Trust me, he's real.

04:47.955 --> 04:51.957
You know, she's right, and
tonight we're gonna prove it,

04:51.959 --> 04:55.560
Because we got
a santa cam,

04:55.562 --> 04:59.564
So we can catch
the big man in red on video.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.566
Santa claus!

05:01.568 --> 05:02.834
Old saint nick!

05:02.836 --> 05:04.803
(french accent):
Papa noel.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.805
(italian accent):
Babbo natale.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.840
(german accent):
Weihnachtsmann.

05:10.343 --> 05:13.445
Which, of course,
means "christmas man" in german.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.514
Teachable moment.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.582
The-the point is,
in the morning,

05:17.584 --> 05:19.518
When you see
him on video,

05:19.520 --> 05:21.586
Then you'll believe
he's real, right?

05:21.588 --> 05:22.454
I guess.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.590
I guess?! What?

05:25.592 --> 05:28.660
Did you hear that, alan?
Did you hear that, evelyn?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.162
(imitating jimmy stewart):
You hear that, clarence?

05:30.164 --> 05:32.597
Merry christmas, you wonderful
old building and loan!

05:32.599 --> 05:36.034
Okay, off to bed you go.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.503
And soon, you'll have
visions of sugar plums

05:38.505 --> 05:40.672
Dancing in your head.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.974
Can I have some pirate rum?

05:42.976 --> 05:44.976
No, we don't want visions

05:44.978 --> 05:47.546
Of pink elephants
dancing in our head.

05:47.548 --> 05:51.850
Okay, you go brush your teeth,
and I'll be in in a minute.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.518
When alan was little
and couldn't sleep,

05:53.520 --> 05:55.287
I used to give him whiskey.

05:55.289 --> 05:58.190
Breast-feeding
doesn't count, mother.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.726
So here's the plan.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.861
Santa's not actually coming.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.496
You don't say.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.031
But how awesome is this?

06:06.033 --> 06:09.201
We got the number two guy from
the thanksgiving day parade.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.702
So, if the giant

06:10.704 --> 06:13.405
Bullwinkle balloon breaks loose
and kills the number one santa,

06:13.407 --> 06:14.806
This is the guy.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.074
Alan:
Yeah.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.542
He also appeared as santa

06:17.544 --> 06:19.911
On an episode of
<i>walker, texas ranger.</i>

06:21.881 --> 06:26.118
He and chuck norris fought the
bad guys with christmas fu.

06:27.587 --> 06:29.421
So, when he gets here,
he's gonna take the presents

06:29.423 --> 06:31.690
That we bought for him, and he's
gonna put them under the tree,

06:31.692 --> 06:33.325
And then we'll get it on video,

06:33.327 --> 06:37.162
And then louis will have the
perfect charlie brown christmas.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.664
(to "hark the herald
angels sing"):
â™ª lou, lou, lou

06:39.666 --> 06:41.600
â™ª lou-lou, lou, lou, lou

06:41.602 --> 06:43.201
Both:
â™ª lou, lou, lou

06:43.203 --> 06:45.203
â™ª lou-lou, lou, lou

06:45.205 --> 06:48.840
â™ª lou, lou, lou,
lou-lou, lou, lou, lou... â™ª

06:48.842 --> 06:50.041
I need rum.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.343
â™ª lou, lou, lou

06:51.345 --> 06:52.711
â™ª lou, lou, lou, lou...

06:52.713 --> 06:54.279
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

06:54.281 --> 06:55.747
Santa's here!

06:55.749 --> 06:58.650
I give you
kris kringle.

07:01.454 --> 07:02.687
Are you smoking pot?

07:02.689 --> 07:04.256
Of course not.

07:05.725 --> 07:07.092
Don't worry.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.094
Santa's got a prescription card.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.129
Well, apparently, the presents

07:11.131 --> 07:13.131
Have already been
delivered in colorado.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.433
(clears throat)

07:14.435 --> 07:16.501
Here. Come on in.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.640
I'm walden.
This is alan and, uh, evelyn.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.109
Uh, wh-what do you go by?
Mr. Claus?

07:24.111 --> 07:25.477
(chuckles)

07:25.479 --> 07:27.379
(italian accent):
Babbo natale?

07:28.614 --> 07:30.582
(german accent):
Weihnachtsmann?

07:30.584 --> 07:32.784
Actually, it's frank.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.719
It's not very christmasy.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.221
Well, if you don't like it,

07:36.223 --> 07:39.124
I can hang some mistletoe
over my ass.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.794
That's my son
you're talking to.

07:43.729 --> 07:44.729
Good one.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.433
I-I... I'm sorry.
We're-we're just really excited.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.735
It's our first christmas
with our foster son.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.637
Uh, basically,
what we're gonna do is

07:52.639 --> 07:54.973
Film you putting the presents
under the tree.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.175
Uh, and then I've written
a little something

07:57.177 --> 07:58.810
For you to say to louis.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.011
Let me guess.

08:00.013 --> 08:03.782
"ho, ho, ho!
Merry christmas, louis!"

08:03.784 --> 08:05.484
Oh, that's better.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.585
Go with that.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.019
Okay, okay, okay,
and then...

08:08.021 --> 08:10.489
Then you'll take a
bite of the cookie,

08:10.491 --> 08:13.792
You'll crunch the carrot,
you'll sip the milk,

08:13.794 --> 08:16.428
Wink at the camera, jiggle
your belly and leave.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.498
So it's toys,
bite, crunch,

08:19.500 --> 08:21.399
Sip, wink,
jiggle, leave.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.703
Toys, bite, crunch, sip,
wink, jiggle, leave.

08:25.872 --> 08:26.671
Got it?

08:26.673 --> 08:29.107
So you want me to be santa.

08:29.109 --> 08:32.844
Toys, bite, crunch, sip,
wink, jiggle, leave.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.281
That sounds a lot like an orgy
I had in palm springs once.

08:36.283 --> 08:39.217
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

08:39.219 --> 08:41.686
All right,
let's get this stuff wrapped

08:41.688 --> 08:44.789
So we can enjoy this holiday
the way I always imagined.

08:44.791 --> 08:48.693
Listening to michael bublÃ©'s
christmas album...

08:48.695 --> 08:51.029
With my husband.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.332
Aw, looks like alan's getting
his first gift early.

08:54.334 --> 08:57.235
Where's the boy's bike?

08:57.237 --> 08:59.304
Oh, right here.

09:01.173 --> 09:03.375
That's not a boy's bike.
That's a box.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.378
The boy's bike's in the box.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.214
Tell me the boy's bike
in the box has been built.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.750
Oh, no, they wanted $75
to assemble it.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.819
That's like ten pairs of pants.

09:14.821 --> 09:17.389
I was paying for it!

09:17.391 --> 09:19.558
Oh, come on.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.626
How hard could it be?

09:24.063 --> 09:25.931
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

09:25.933 --> 09:27.832
Uh, sorry, looks like
it's gonna be

09:27.834 --> 09:29.167
A little longer
than we expected.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.870
Uh, any chance you know how
to put together a bike?

09:31.872 --> 09:35.840
Right now, I'm too buzzed
to have a tool in my hand.

09:37.443 --> 09:40.278
I'm just buzzed enough
to have a tool in mine.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.549
Well, ho, ho, ho.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.117
Exactly.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.786
Here.

09:47.788 --> 09:51.189
Let me get us both
a little more eggnog.

09:51.191 --> 09:55.126
Um, santa, did you drive your
own sleigh over here tonight?

09:55.128 --> 09:57.862
Nope. Santa ubered.

09:59.799 --> 10:02.767
Oh, well, uh, hope your driver
was named rudolph.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.569
(laughs)

10:04.571 --> 10:06.271
Um, so what's going on?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.706
Does santa know you're married?

10:07.708 --> 10:11.309
Does the irs know
you don't have five children?

10:13.279 --> 10:15.780
Marty and I have
an open marriage.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.282
And since he's 93,

10:17.284 --> 10:20.785
My end opens a little more
frequently than his.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.821
As does your mouth.

10:22.823 --> 10:26.858
That's one of the ends
I was talking about.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.962
Here you go.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.633
You're running low on eggnog,
so this one is all rum.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.735
(laughs)
thank you.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.803
You know, this is a situation

10:38.805 --> 10:41.039
Where santa doesn't
need a little helper.

10:42.608 --> 10:45.176
So on, prancer.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.811
Fine.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.480
But just know this:

10:48.482 --> 10:51.750
I am not afraid to give santa
a negative review on yelp.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.819
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

10:54.821 --> 10:57.989
Okay, I can't make heads
or tails of these instructions.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.290
They're barely in english.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.960
Uh, "the bolts of turning

11:01.962 --> 11:05.630
"shall revolve clockwords

11:05.632 --> 11:09.367
As in above figure below."

11:09.369 --> 11:13.004
Does it say anything about
roommate of cheapness shall have

11:13.006 --> 11:16.174
Foot inserted
in back hole till tight?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.709
Oh.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.544
I guess on the first day
of christmas,

11:19.546 --> 11:21.312
My true love threatened me.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.014
I'm sorry, but it's louis's

11:23.016 --> 11:24.649
First christmas
not in the group home,

11:24.651 --> 11:26.351
And I want it to be perfect.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.219
No christmas is ever perfect.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.554
There's always gonna be a toy

11:29.556 --> 11:31.623
That's broken
or the wrong kind of batteries.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.224
I mean, even on
the very first christmas,

11:33.226 --> 11:36.628
Mary and joseph woke up
to the smell of donkey crap.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.830
I know. I just...

11:38.832 --> 11:40.832
I want him to believe in santa,

11:40.834 --> 11:42.634
And-and get this bike

11:42.636 --> 11:45.970
And-and wake up to a
winter wonderland.

11:45.972 --> 11:48.206
Not that I ordered
a truckload of snow.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.643
I didn't get reindeer!

11:51.645 --> 11:53.978
Well, they're endangered.

11:53.980 --> 11:57.048
We could still make
christmas special for louis.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.150
We just got to finish this bike.
We can do this.

11:59.152 --> 12:02.153
You're right. We got
an m.I.T. Engineer and a...

12:02.155 --> 12:04.556
Formerly board-certified
chiropractor.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.524
Yeah, now we're talking.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.892
I mean, this can't
be more difficult

12:07.894 --> 12:09.928
Than realigning someone's spine.
(scoffs)

12:09.930 --> 12:11.996
Here.
(chuckles)
you know, you got, uh...

12:11.998 --> 12:15.066
You got your, uh, your l2,
uh, connected to your l3.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.935
(chuckles)
and all we have to do is

12:16.937 --> 12:20.004
Put the right pressure
on the right spot and...

12:23.576 --> 12:26.010
Uh, and that is why I am

12:26.012 --> 12:29.948
A  <i>formerly</i>board-certified
chiropractor.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.382
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

12:31.384 --> 12:34.052
(bells jingling rhythmically)

12:34.054 --> 12:36.921
Evelyn (moaning):
Oh, santa.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.591
(bells jingling faster)

12:39.593 --> 12:41.659
Oh, santa!

12:43.362 --> 12:45.196
Oh, no.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.531
(bells jingling rapidly)

12:46.533 --> 12:49.567
Santa:
Here comes santa claus!

12:49.569 --> 12:53.371
Here comes
santa claus!

12:53.373 --> 12:55.673
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

12:58.978 --> 13:01.146
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

13:01.148 --> 13:02.647
Oh, my god.

13:02.649 --> 13:03.815
What happened?

13:03.817 --> 13:05.717
I saw mommy banging santa claus.

13:07.486 --> 13:10.722
What?
It's 1972 all over again.

13:12.091 --> 13:13.992
We have a problem.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.660
Yes, you have a problem.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.897
You are the christmas whore!

13:18.899 --> 13:22.333
Be that as it may, I think
I killed santa claus.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.969
Oh, god!

13:24.971 --> 13:27.071
It's exactly like 1972!

13:28.741 --> 13:30.575
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

13:30.577 --> 13:32.110
Is he gonna be okay?

13:32.112 --> 13:33.611
Yeah, it was just
atrial fibrillation.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.680
He just needs some medication
and a few days rest.

13:35.682 --> 13:39.017
You hear that, sweetheart?
I'll be fine by new year's.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.820
I'll be counting down
till the balls drop.

13:44.957 --> 13:47.125
Well, thank god louis
didn't see any of this.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.526
He would've been
traumatized.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.995
Louis? What about me?

13:50.997 --> 13:53.765
The man almost died
while he was having sex with me.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.168
That's not easy to get over.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.071
No matter how many times
it happens.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.541
Okay, well, all right,
well, there you have it.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.510
Merry christmas, louis.

14:05.512 --> 14:09.147
Your grandmother banged santa
within an inch of his life.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.050
Here's half a bike!

14:12.052 --> 14:15.286
There's still enough time
to-to finish the bike,

14:15.288 --> 14:17.522
Wrap the other gifts
and get them under the tree.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.524
Okay, you're right.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.527
Louis will be asleep
for six more hours.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.062
Louis:
Walden?

14:24.064 --> 14:26.397
Oh, come on!

14:26.399 --> 14:28.967
I heard a noise. Did santa come?

14:28.969 --> 14:30.368
Sadly, no.

14:32.071 --> 14:35.006
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

14:35.008 --> 14:37.008
All right.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.209
Where's evelyn?

14:38.211 --> 14:40.578
Oh, well, uh...

14:40.580 --> 14:43.648
She went to her house
to play with...

14:43.650 --> 14:45.016
Her toys.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.085
All right, time for bed, bud.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.087
That's right.
Santa's on his way.
All right.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.521
If santa is real,

14:50.523 --> 14:53.191
Then how does he get in all
the kids' houses in one night?

14:53.193 --> 14:56.661
Well, he's got
christmas magic.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.063
And how does he know
where everybody lives?

14:59.065 --> 15:03.101
Well... That's the magic
of google maps.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.936
All right.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.405
Good night, buddy.
Time to go to sleep.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.008
Can you guys stay with me
till I fall asleep?

15:11.277 --> 15:13.278
Sure.
Yeah.

15:13.280 --> 15:17.315
It's not like we need to help
santa assemble toys.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.586
He pays his elves
$75 to do that.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.423
That's timothy's spot.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.125
Oh, oh, okay.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.226
Um...

15:28.228 --> 15:30.295
I guess, uh...

15:40.806 --> 15:42.340
Good boy.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.344
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

15:50.282 --> 15:51.783
Alan?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.217
Mm-hmm?

15:54.720 --> 15:56.220
Oh, oh, my god!

15:56.222 --> 15:57.922
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.258
I get one every morning.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.793
Where's louis?

16:01.795 --> 16:03.061
Hmm?

16:03.063 --> 16:04.262
It's 7:00.
We fell asleep.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.264
Oh, crap. Th-the bike.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.899
The presents.
What are we gonna do?

16:07.901 --> 16:10.735
Well, is it too late to
tell him we're jewish?

16:12.471 --> 16:14.472
What the...

16:14.474 --> 16:16.908
Santa came! He is real!

16:16.910 --> 16:18.109
Did you...?

16:18.111 --> 16:19.444
No.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.179
He's on the video.

16:23.015 --> 16:28.319
You didn't see grandma evelyn
wrestling with santa, did you?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.855
No, just santa.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.924
Alan:
That's...

16:32.926 --> 16:35.259
Santa.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.661
Oh, my god.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.963
If the easy bake oven
I have always wanted

16:38.965 --> 16:42.300
Is under that tree,
it is gonna blow my mind.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.268
Can I go outside
and ride my bike?

16:44.270 --> 16:46.337
Sure.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.772
Alan, do you
want to...?

16:47.774 --> 16:49.173
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.342
Uh, let's go, buddy.
(chuckles)

16:51.344 --> 16:53.311
Looks like we had
a great christmas

16:53.313 --> 16:55.380
And saved $75.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.032
Rose?

17:14.034 --> 17:16.234
All right, come on, rose,
I know you're down there.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.368
Actually, I'm
behind you.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.970
Ah, son of a...!

17:18.972 --> 17:21.539
How do you do that?

17:21.541 --> 17:23.341
<i>Why</i> do you do that?!

17:23.343 --> 17:25.910
Oh, a girl's got to have
a little fun.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.712
Merry christmas.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.848
I-I cannot believe that you
went to all that trouble for us.

17:30.850 --> 17:34.185
You mean you can't believe
santa went to all that trouble.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.187
Okay, then I guess

17:36.189 --> 17:39.190
I need to say
thank you to santa.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.259
Well, he doesn't
do it for the thanks,

17:41.261 --> 17:43.027
He does it because
he genuinely wants

17:43.029 --> 17:45.163
To make the people
in his life happy.

17:46.265 --> 17:47.598
Are you happy, walden?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.367
I am.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.236
I-I couldn't have imagined
a better christmas morning.

17:52.238 --> 17:56.340
I mean, other than waking up
with alan poking me in the back.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.576
Listen, I...

17:58.578 --> 18:02.380
I'm sorry that I said
I didn't want you around.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.548
Oh, please.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.349
It's not like every time
somebody says

18:05.351 --> 18:07.919
Something mean to me, I write
it down in a big book called

18:07.921 --> 18:10.288
"those who have wronged me."
(chuckles)

18:10.290 --> 18:12.290
That's funny.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.891
I think.

18:13.893 --> 18:18.429
Well, I told you before,
I just want to be your friend.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.431
Well, you are.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.233
And...

18:22.235 --> 18:24.402
I'm sorry if I forgot that.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.104
Oh.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.805
(chuckles)

18:27.807 --> 18:29.807
Oh, hey, but how did santa

18:29.809 --> 18:31.943
Manage to put
that bike together?

18:31.945 --> 18:34.879
The instructions couldn't
have been any clearer.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.148
"the bolts of turning
shall revolve clockwords

18:37.150 --> 18:38.749
As in above figure below."

18:38.751 --> 18:41.085
(chuckles)
duh.

18:41.087 --> 18:44.655
Yeah. Duh.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.924
Do you guys have
big plans for later?

18:46.926 --> 18:48.893
Uh, no, just the usual.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.262
Open gifts, call family,

18:51.264 --> 18:53.297
Hope that you get
their voice mail.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.466
Oh, the best part is
alan's gonna deep-fry a turkey,

18:55.468 --> 18:58.402
So there's a 50/50 chance
he'll catch himself on fire.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.271
Oh, I got you guys

19:00.273 --> 19:03.274
A little something
for the house.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.243
And I hope that every time
you look at it,

19:05.245 --> 19:06.477
You'll think of me.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.146
(chuckles)

19:08.148 --> 19:10.815
Oh! A cuckoo clock.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.517
I get it. 'cause you're...

19:12.519 --> 19:13.518
(whistles)

19:13.520 --> 19:14.585
(chuckles)

19:14.587 --> 19:15.887
What?

19:17.156 --> 19:19.157
No.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.492
Because it's red like a rose.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.462
How could you
hurt me on christmas?

19:24.464 --> 19:26.330
I'm sorry. I-I...

19:26.332 --> 19:28.432
I thought it was...
Oh, I'm just kidding.

19:28.434 --> 19:31.369
No, it's totally
'cause I'm cuckoo.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.705
Well, merry christmas, walden.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.678
Merry christmas, rose.

19:42.648 --> 19:44.215
(clock chiming, cuckooing)

19:44.217 --> 19:46.217
(laughs)

19:46.219 --> 19:49.320
How cute is that?
It's a tiny rose.

19:49.322 --> 19:52.690
Wait, is that her real hair?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.692
Rose:
No, it's yours.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.527
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

20:04.837 --> 20:07.572

20:07.574 --> 20:11.075

20:27.360 --> 20:29.427
Deep-fried fingers.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.998

20:38.036 --> 20:39.904
That was sweet of rose.
Yeah.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.273
You know, I-I've always

20:42.275 --> 20:44.942
Maybe she does just want
to be friends, you know?

20:44.944 --> 20:48.012
â™ª now, he sees you
when you're sleeping... â™ª
