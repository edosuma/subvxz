-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.167 --> 00:36.233
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.800
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.833 --> 00:40.000
in a court of law.

00:42.233 --> 00:44.233
-I grew up watching my dad.

00:44.267 --> 00:47.433
He was a detective
and he was on the SWAT team.

00:47.467 --> 00:49.333
He did a lot
of fun things in it.

00:49.367 --> 00:51.667
It was just always
something that excited me,

00:51.700 --> 00:53.100
and, you know,
when I was a kid,

00:53.133 --> 00:56.300
I-- thought my dad
was Batman. (chuckles)

00:56.333 --> 00:58.867
But it was always
something really cool to see,

00:58.900 --> 01:01.267
and I knew that's something
that I wanted to do,

01:01.300 --> 01:04.133
and I like that I have
a son now, too,

01:04.167 --> 01:08.500
and I hope that I can
carry that on through him.

01:12.133 --> 01:15.067
We're gonna stop this guy
over here on the bike.

01:15.067 --> 01:17.300
He's-- It's super dark
over here.

01:17.333 --> 01:19.767
He's got no lights on,
he doesn't have a helmet on,

01:19.800 --> 01:21.467
and I'm not sure
what he's up to.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.567
He looked back at me
and looked like he wanted
to get away from me, but...

01:24.600 --> 01:27.567
-(radio beeps)
-We're on 2600 block
of A Street.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.600
A black male
on a bike.

01:29.633 --> 01:31.533
-Man on radio:
26 and A.

01:33.567 --> 01:34.967
-'Sup, man?
-'Sup?

01:35.067 --> 01:36.367
-Where's your helmet?

01:36.400 --> 01:37.967
-My helmet?
Um, I don't have one.
I was just comin'--

01:38.067 --> 01:39.067
-You got some ID on you?

01:39.067 --> 01:40.133
-No, I don't.
-You don't?

01:40.167 --> 01:41.167
-No.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.533
-Don't have any ID
on you or anything?

01:42.567 --> 01:44.667
-No.
-What you got
in your pocket there?

01:44.700 --> 01:46.233
No, in the baggie.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.167
-This right here?
-Yup, that right there.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.433
-Oh (bleep).

01:52.333 --> 01:53.833
-Foot pursuit!

02:02.600 --> 02:06.167
541. County, I'm running,
westbound towards the M now.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.933
-(police radio chatter)

02:08.967 --> 02:10.700
-At the Blue Spruce!
Blue Spruce!

02:10.733 --> 02:12.300
-Officer:
Get on the ground!

02:12.333 --> 02:14.400
-Masko:
He's stopping.
On your knees.

02:14.433 --> 02:16.100
Get on your knees
or we're gonna tase you.

02:16.133 --> 02:17.233
Hands on your head.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.733
-Officer:
Put your hands on your head!

02:24.233 --> 02:26.300
-Grabbed my taser.

02:28.567 --> 02:30.067
The other hand back here.

02:30.067 --> 02:33.167
-(police radio chatter)

02:33.200 --> 02:34.833
-Hand behind your back, dude.

02:42.267 --> 02:43.967
-(radio chatter)

02:45.667 --> 02:47.367
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:49.067 --> 02:52.067
-He's in custody.
Cancel the beeper.

02:52.067 --> 02:53.700
Cancel incoming.

02:55.467 --> 02:56.833
Let's get up.

02:56.867 --> 02:58.467
Knees in front of ya.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.667
Stand up.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.133
Come on.

03:01.167 --> 03:03.367
You're a strong guy.
There you go.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.733
Grab that.

03:07.833 --> 03:09.433
-(radio chatter)
-Okay, thank you.

03:09.467 --> 03:11.133
Why'd you run?

03:12.667 --> 03:14.233
Wanna talk to me?

03:14.267 --> 03:15.867
-What are you
arresting me for?

03:15.900 --> 03:20.067
-For the dope
that you ran away from me for.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.933
That I saw when you took it
out of your pocket.

03:22.967 --> 03:24.600
-I have nothing to say.

03:24.633 --> 03:26.333
-Nothing to say? Okay.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.200
Why'd you run, man?

03:29.233 --> 03:32.167
-Because... thought
I might have a warrant.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.800
-You have a warrant?
-Might.

03:33.833 --> 03:35.733
-Might? Okay.
Any ID on you?

03:35.767 --> 03:37.100
No?

03:38.300 --> 03:39.667
We'll get his name.

03:41.167 --> 03:42.667
Oh, nice.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.567
Where'd you throw
the dope at?

03:45.633 --> 03:47.067
Right when you ran?

03:47.100 --> 03:48.833
-Nothing to say.
-Okay.

03:48.867 --> 03:51.067
That's fine.
We'll find it.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.533
He dropped the dope
either right before he ran,

03:54.567 --> 03:56.867
where I stopped him
in front of my car,

03:56.900 --> 03:58.500
or when we chased him,
so will you...

03:58.533 --> 04:00.400
-I'll go look.
-...walk back and see
if you can--

04:00.433 --> 04:03.633
-There's flashlights
on the back bumper.
-Okay, thank you.

04:03.667 --> 04:07.067
-So he had it what side?
What pocket do you guys
think he had it in?

04:07.067 --> 04:09.067
-It was in his right.
-In his right pocket?

04:09.067 --> 04:11.733
-I think it fell out
'cause I never saw him
throw it outright.

04:11.767 --> 04:12.867
I was on top of him.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.067
Was that you
running behind me?

04:14.067 --> 04:15.767
-I was right behind you.
Yeah, I didn't see any

04:15.800 --> 04:17.100
obvious signs
of pitching it.

04:17.133 --> 04:19.633
-And he didn't throw anything
where we detained him, so.

04:19.667 --> 04:23.733
He think that fell out
of his pant let there.
-Oh, okay.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.067
-The baggie you had
in your pocket,

04:27.100 --> 04:28.533
we haven't been able
to find it.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.867
Do you remember
where you threw it, man?

04:30.900 --> 04:33.200
-I've got nothing to say, again.

04:34.567 --> 04:35.633
These are mine, so--

04:35.667 --> 04:37.633
-Do you really want
a kid to find that, man?

04:40.533 --> 04:42.233
I don't want that on me.

04:44.967 --> 04:47.067
Because we have this
documented right here,

04:47.067 --> 04:49.633
with what happened,
if a kid finds that

04:49.667 --> 04:53.200
and gets hurt by that,
you can be liable for that.

04:53.233 --> 04:55.233
We can be talkin' homicide.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.200
Your choice if you want
to keep your mouth shut.
-I know. I just say--

05:02.233 --> 05:05.067
I say search more right now.
We'll see. I don't...

05:05.100 --> 05:07.733
-Okay, got it.
I'll let you stew on that.

05:08.733 --> 05:09.967
-Come on out, man.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.800
We'll walk over to the front
of the car here, okay?

05:13.833 --> 05:15.667
I didn't find
your sheath anywhere.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.300
Is it still in your pant leg
or anything?

05:17.333 --> 05:18.400
-No.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.500
-You got it?
Oh, there you go.

05:20.533 --> 05:22.167
Here is your sheath.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.833
Come on over, man.

05:26.467 --> 05:29.100
Any reason why
you have these, man?

05:30.800 --> 05:32.333
No reason?

05:33.567 --> 05:34.767
Okay.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.133
Not a hunter?

05:36.167 --> 05:38.400
Any reason why
this was not in the sheath?

05:38.433 --> 05:41.200
You just had it
in your pocket?

05:41.233 --> 05:43.833
I'm just saying I wouldn't want
to run with that in my pocket.

05:43.867 --> 05:45.200
You know what I mean?
-It just fell out.

05:45.233 --> 05:46.967
-It didn't fall
out of your sheath though.

05:47.067 --> 05:48.633
'Cause it fell out
of your sheath

05:48.667 --> 05:50.067
and into your pocket?

05:50.100 --> 05:52.167
That doesn't make sense, right?

05:52.200 --> 05:54.067
I'm just being honest
with you, man.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.300
So that with-- in
your pocket running,

05:56.333 --> 05:58.600
you're lucky
you didn't stab yourself.

05:58.633 --> 06:00.067
It's sharp.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.633
All right. When's the last time
you smoked?

06:06.467 --> 06:08.700
Jail's gonna ask you too.

06:08.733 --> 06:10.100
Did you smoke it all today?
-No.

06:10.133 --> 06:12.400
-You're not very amped up,
so it doesn't seem like it. No?

06:12.433 --> 06:13.633
-No.
-Okay.

06:13.667 --> 06:14.867
All right.

06:16.067 --> 06:19.067
Let's go have a seat
back in the car here, okay?

06:19.067 --> 06:20.567
All right, man,
so you're gonna go

06:20.600 --> 06:22.833
for havin' the knives on ya,

06:22.867 --> 06:25.467
for havin' the meth on ya,

06:25.500 --> 06:27.100
and the little pipe,

06:27.133 --> 06:30.133
as well as running
from me, okay?

06:30.167 --> 06:33.500
But at least you did
the right thing
and eventually stopped.

06:33.533 --> 06:35.700
Did you just get burnt out?
Run out of gas?

06:35.733 --> 06:37.267
Yeah? Okay.

06:37.300 --> 06:40.167
We're gonna put your bike
and everything else
into property, okay?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.567
-(door closes)

06:44.667 --> 06:46.667
-I've been a police officer here
for two-and-a-half years

06:46.700 --> 06:49.333
and this part
of the community here
is second to none.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.533
For instance, we had an officer
get in a pretty back wreck

06:52.567 --> 06:54.433
and he had to be hospitalized.

06:54.467 --> 06:56.133
Just seeing the outpour
of the community,

06:56.167 --> 06:57.833
the way that they came
to the police department,

06:57.867 --> 07:00.100
showed us love,
showed us they appreciated us,

07:00.133 --> 07:02.567
the community was
behind him 100%

07:02.600 --> 07:05.767
and praying for him
and just his healing process

07:05.800 --> 07:09.100
has shown the support
that we've had.

07:09.133 --> 07:12.067
-(police radio chatter)

07:12.067 --> 07:17.067
-We got dispatched out here
to the flea market.

07:17.067 --> 07:20.467
Referenced alarms going off
and officers arrived

07:20.500 --> 07:24.367
and stated that
they heard people inside,

07:24.400 --> 07:26.767
saw people inside.

07:26.800 --> 07:27.967
-(car door opens)

07:28.067 --> 07:29.400
-(radio chatter)

07:34.900 --> 07:36.267
-What do you got goin' on?

07:36.300 --> 07:38.167
-I looked through the crack
in that door over there,

07:38.200 --> 07:40.667
and I saw three suspects.
They were walking.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.500
It looked like they were
carrying bags full of stuff

07:42.533 --> 07:43.900
and making
their way eastbound.

07:43.933 --> 07:45.967
-(dog barks)
-I want the west side
blocked off

07:46.067 --> 07:47.667
and the south side
blocked off with officers,

07:47.700 --> 07:50.633
and I'll be over here,
and if they come this way,
let 'em come this way.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.733
They're not gonna stop,
but we'll cut 'em off.
-All right.

07:52.767 --> 07:54.933
-(radio beeps)
-Everybody off the east side.

07:54.967 --> 07:56.867
Go to the north side
and just light it up.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.200
-Man on radio:
10-4.

07:58.233 --> 07:59.733
-Did y'all see movement
up there on the roof?
-Yes.

07:59.767 --> 08:01.600
-Yep, there's movement up there.
-(clanging)

08:01.633 --> 08:03.333
-Man on radio:
129, they're on the roof.

08:03.367 --> 08:05.733
They're on the rooftop
coming towards the north side.

08:05.767 --> 08:07.900
-(K-9 barks)

08:07.933 --> 08:09.467
-Yeah, I see him.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.767
-The Amarillo Police Department
K-9 Unit!

08:11.800 --> 08:13.333
We see you
on the roof!

08:13.367 --> 08:15.067
Identify yourself!

08:15.067 --> 08:17.100
-(brisk footsteps)
-They're running.
They're running south.

08:17.133 --> 08:18.733
-Man 1 on radio:
They're running south.

08:18.767 --> 08:21.267
-Man 2 on radio:
429, we have one in custody.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.667
Searching for the others.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.567
-They have one in custody
and the other two

08:24.600 --> 08:26.067
are still running around
in there.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.800
He thinks he has
the suspects trapped

08:27.833 --> 08:29.900
inside a unit.
They just can't get into it yet.

08:29.933 --> 08:32.200
-Here! Here!
They're here.

08:32.233 --> 08:34.333
-(officer coughing)

08:34.367 --> 08:36.367
-They found that other suspect
in the wall

08:36.400 --> 08:38.200
and they pepper sprayed him,
so now we're gonna go

08:38.233 --> 08:41.233
meet up with the rest
of the crew down here.

08:41.267 --> 08:43.133
-(officer coughing)

08:43.167 --> 08:45.100
-Try to find
the other two suspects.

08:45.133 --> 08:48.433
-(officer coughing)
-(K-9 barking)

08:48.467 --> 08:50.067
-This one here?
-Yep.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.667
-There you go.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.267
Little bulldog.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.667
-(coughing)

08:57.700 --> 09:00.433
-Off. Turn the light off.
Light off.

09:00.467 --> 09:02.567
-(K-9 barking)

09:02.600 --> 09:04.367
-What you got?
-Right here! Here!

09:04.400 --> 09:06.800
They're in here! Here!

09:08.067 --> 09:09.467
Here you go. Here.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.667
-(K-9 barks)

09:10.700 --> 09:12.767
-There you go.
Through here.

09:14.233 --> 09:16.333
Here! Here! They're here.

09:16.367 --> 09:17.567
Here you go. Here.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.633
-(K-9 whines, barks)

09:20.667 --> 09:22.767
-I think the dog
just hit somethin'.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.133
-(K-9 barks)

09:25.167 --> 09:26.567
-Whoa!

09:26.600 --> 09:28.800
-(laughter)

09:28.833 --> 09:30.100
-You all good?
(laughs)

09:30.133 --> 09:31.933
-Here.
-(speaks German command)

09:31.967 --> 09:33.933
-Here we go.
One's up top. One's up top!

09:33.967 --> 09:35.700
-I give--
Okay, I give up though!

09:35.733 --> 09:37.467
-Get down and get
on the ground now!

09:37.500 --> 09:39.333
-Come on, come on!
-Get down!

09:39.367 --> 09:41.100
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

09:41.133 --> 09:42.200
-I do. I do, sir.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.900
-Get him!
Get him locked up.

09:43.933 --> 09:45.433
-(K-9 barks)

09:49.300 --> 09:50.867
-Get on the ground!

09:50.900 --> 09:52.833
I got one.

09:52.867 --> 09:54.067
Get down!

09:55.100 --> 09:56.367
-Okay, I'm bringing him
to the car.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.500
-(yelling)

09:58.533 --> 10:01.900
He's go-- There! Here!
Bite, Night!

10:01.933 --> 10:03.900
Night, bite!
Night, bite! Good boy.

10:03.933 --> 10:06.900
Good boy. Yeah.
(speaks German)

10:06.933 --> 10:09.067
-You got it?

10:09.100 --> 10:10.600
Here.

10:10.633 --> 10:12.400
-You're a good boy.

10:12.433 --> 10:14.433
Oh, good.

10:14.467 --> 10:16.500
(speaks German command)

10:20.900 --> 10:23.100
-Hey, why didn't y'all come out?
-Excuse me, sir?

10:23.133 --> 10:25.067
-Why didn't y'all come out
whenever you heard us in here?

10:25.100 --> 10:26.733
-Because we're scared, sir.

10:26.767 --> 10:28.267
-Scared of what?

10:28.300 --> 10:30.100
-Scared of the dog, sir.

10:30.133 --> 10:31.967
-Oh, okay.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.833
-I got a bite
in my leg, sir.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.067
-Okay. We have
an ambulance waiting for you.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.300
Ready? Now stand up.

10:37.333 --> 10:38.333
-Ready.

10:39.433 --> 10:40.933
-Okay. Let's go.

10:40.967 --> 10:43.500
We'll get you outside
and you can get it
all checked out.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
Where are you from?

10:46.433 --> 10:48.200
-I'm from Burma, sir.
-Burma?

10:48.233 --> 10:49.900
-Oh, okay.

10:49.933 --> 10:51.467
Here, sit down.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.667
Cross your feet.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.167
-And what's your first name?
-M-I-N.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.667
-M-I-N?
-Yes, sir.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.933
-Min? Min?
-Yes, sir.

10:57.967 --> 10:59.567
-Why didn't you come out?

10:59.600 --> 11:01.600
-Because I'm scared
of the dog, sir.

11:01.633 --> 11:03.900
-That's why you come out.
So you don't get bit.

11:03.933 --> 11:06.900
-I didn't know, sir. I'm--
-You knew that. We told
you to come out.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.100
Right?

11:08.133 --> 11:09.867
-How do you pronounce
your first name?
-Chee-ko.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.733
-Chee-ko?
-Yes, sir. Yeah, I know that--

11:11.767 --> 11:13.133
-Were you the one
on the roof?
-Huh?

11:13.167 --> 11:15.533
-Did you go up on the roof?
-That didn't have to happen.

11:15.567 --> 11:17.833
-Yeah, did you see us out there?
-I did, sir. I did.

11:17.867 --> 11:19.633
-Why did you go
back inside?

11:19.667 --> 11:21.367
-I got scared.
-You got scared?

11:21.400 --> 11:22.933
What'd you get scared of?

11:22.967 --> 11:24.967
-'Cause we were
doing bad things and--

11:25.067 --> 11:26.900
-'Cause you were
doing bad things?
-Yeah, yes. Yes.

11:26.933 --> 11:29.533
And y'all supposed
to get bad people and--

11:29.567 --> 11:31.300
-Well, if you knew
we were out there,

11:31.333 --> 11:33.067
you knew we had
the place surrounded, right?

11:33.100 --> 11:34.900
-Yes, sir.
-Did you think you had
anywhere to go?

11:34.933 --> 11:37.133
-No, sir. That's why
we went back inside.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.667
We didn't know
what to do.

11:38.700 --> 11:39.967
-Yeah?
-Yes, sir.

11:40.067 --> 11:43.100
-So, you just decided to hide
and let the dog find you?

11:43.133 --> 11:45.133
-No, not really.

11:45.167 --> 11:48.067
-I bet you'd never--
I bet you'd never let
the dog find you, huh?

11:48.067 --> 11:50.367
-I've never been
in a situation like this before.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.400
That's why I panicked.

11:51.433 --> 11:53.333
But it already happened,
you know?

11:53.367 --> 11:54.833
-It didn't have to though.

11:54.867 --> 11:56.767
-If you were to come out,
you wouldn't have got
bitten by the dog.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.100
-What did y'all do
when the dog came in?

11:58.133 --> 12:00.300
-I grabbed the mouth.
-You grabbed his mouth?

12:00.333 --> 12:01.800
-Yeah, because
I don't know what to do.

12:01.833 --> 12:03.700
He bite me
so I just grabbed his mouth

12:03.733 --> 12:05.200
and threw him off.

12:05.233 --> 12:07.800
So he get off
and then he bit my leg.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.400
Why were y'all trying
to get in there, man?

12:09.433 --> 12:11.067
-Anything. Everything.
I don't--

12:11.067 --> 12:13.067
-Anything and everything?
-Yes.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.067
-So is this the stuff
that you found on the roof?

12:16.067 --> 12:17.833
-Yeah, we got four
or five bags here.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.933
We found it
right next to the--

12:19.967 --> 12:23.067
They took that hammer
and punched a hole
into the skylight.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.833
We got a bunch of games
and sunglasses, wallets.

12:25.867 --> 12:28.300
That bag right there, probably
about 100 pieces of jewelry.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.600
They had to have been
up there for quite some time.

12:30.633 --> 12:31.800
-Cool.

12:31.833 --> 12:34.133
All right, we're gonna
put you in this car, okay?

12:35.300 --> 12:36.833
What's gonna happen now,
guys, is we're gonna

12:36.867 --> 12:38.400
take y'all to
the hospital, okay?

12:38.433 --> 12:39.667
Y'all are gonna
get medically cleared

12:39.700 --> 12:41.167
and then y'all are gonna
be booked into jail.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.633
-Okay.
-Okay?

12:42.667 --> 12:45.800
Y'all are gonna
be booked to jail
for burglary of a building.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.067
-Yes, sir.
-Okay?

12:47.067 --> 12:49.200
Because by breaking in there,
that's burglary.

12:49.233 --> 12:50.233
-Okay.
-Okay?

12:50.267 --> 12:51.900
You're gonna face
another charge

12:51.933 --> 12:53.700
for grabbing a hold
of the dog's mouth

12:53.733 --> 12:55.400
and trying to pull
it off of you, you understand?

12:55.433 --> 12:57.600
-No, I just covered it, sir.
-Say what?

12:57.633 --> 12:59.133
-I just covered it, sir.

12:59.167 --> 13:01.833
Because he bite me,
so I just trying to push his--

13:01.867 --> 13:03.933
-Wait. The reason
that happened,

13:03.967 --> 13:06.867
we came in there,
we told you who was in there,

13:06.900 --> 13:08.967
we told you
we're the police, all right?

13:09.067 --> 13:11.233
We gave you more
than plenty of chances

13:11.267 --> 13:12.500
to come out
and talk to us,

13:12.533 --> 13:14.067
and you refused
to do so, okay?

13:14.067 --> 13:16.367
Grabbing a hold of that dog
is just like grabbing
a hold of us.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.233
He wears a badge
on his little uniform

13:18.267 --> 13:19.400
just like ours, okay?

13:19.433 --> 13:20.467
-Yes, sir. I know.

13:23.500 --> 13:28.167
-I've been a police officer
for a little over seven years.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.267
My older brother,
he's been a cop

13:31.300 --> 13:32.767
for almost 10 years

13:32.800 --> 13:34.733
and listening
to his stories

13:34.767 --> 13:38.333
and kind of prompted me
to want to do the job as well.

13:39.867 --> 13:41.800
I'm doing a hotel check.

13:41.833 --> 13:44.067
This area has
a lot of prostitution,

13:44.067 --> 13:47.400
and there's activity
in general going on

13:47.433 --> 13:49.100
in the parking lots here.

14:04.067 --> 14:05.900
-(radio beeps)
-(mutters)

14:05.933 --> 14:09.933
The vehicle was taken
earlier this morning.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.800
-(radio chatter)

14:18.833 --> 14:21.533
-10-3. Help me out
with it. Occupied.

14:21.567 --> 14:23.067
See your hand.
Put your hands up.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.567
Get on the ground!

14:24.600 --> 14:26.733
-Why, man?
-Face down!

14:26.767 --> 14:28.067
-What's up?
-Both of you!

14:28.067 --> 14:29.167
-Damn!

14:29.200 --> 14:30.633
-At the Star.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.700
-What is going on?
-Don't move!

14:32.733 --> 14:34.367
-What do I do?
What do I do?
-(radio chatter)

14:34.400 --> 14:35.667
-Negative. It's occupied.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.067
I had a white male walk away.

14:38.067 --> 14:40.300
I have him proned out right now
in front of room 25.

14:40.333 --> 14:41.967
Put your hands
all the way out!

14:42.067 --> 14:44.067
All the way out
just like that!

14:44.067 --> 14:45.800
-What's going on?
-What did I do?

14:47.433 --> 14:49.367
-What?

14:49.400 --> 14:52.133
-The car's back here,
but they came out of it

14:52.167 --> 14:53.933
and it--
Coming back stolen.

14:53.967 --> 14:55.533
-You got us on the ground.
What's going on?

14:57.833 --> 14:59.900
-(woman whimpers)

15:00.067 --> 15:01.833
-Keep your hands out
in front of you.
-Yes. I'm scared.

15:01.867 --> 15:05.067
Sorry, I've just never
been in trouble ever. Like...

15:05.100 --> 15:07.067
I don't know.
I've never been
in trouble before.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.900
-So what's up? Can I--
-I don't know what to do.

15:08.933 --> 15:10.367
-Can you tell me
what's going on?

15:10.400 --> 15:12.067
I don't got nothing
on me, dude.

15:12.100 --> 15:13.833
-All right, roll over.

15:13.867 --> 15:15.900
All right, tuck one leg
under your other leg.

15:15.933 --> 15:17.300
All right, we're gonna
pick you up.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.833
-I don't think I can
get up like that.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.100
I'm a big girl.

15:20.133 --> 15:22.800
I don't think I can
get up like that, no.

15:22.833 --> 15:23.967
I'm scared.
I don't know.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.333
I've never been in trouble.
-Stand up.

15:25.367 --> 15:26.833
-I've never been in trouble.
I'm so scared.

15:26.867 --> 15:28.267
-You're scared?
-Yeah!

15:28.300 --> 15:29.833
-Okay.
-'Cause I don't know...

15:29.867 --> 15:32.067
-Okay, for right now,
you're being detained.

15:32.067 --> 15:33.700
Okay? Um...
-(breathing heavily)

15:33.733 --> 15:35.067
Okay.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.767
For what? Can I--

15:36.800 --> 15:39.067
-That vehicle,
it comes back stolen, okay?

15:39.100 --> 15:40.300
Are you staying here
right now?

15:40.333 --> 15:41.933
-No.
-No? What are
you guys doing here?

15:41.967 --> 15:43.967
-How old are you?
-I just walked over with him.

15:44.067 --> 15:45.567
I was at the 99 Cents Store.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.300
-Did you guys-- That's where
you guys came from?

15:47.333 --> 15:49.167
The 99 Cents Store?
-Yeah, that's where I came from.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.067
-What's your relation with him?

15:51.100 --> 15:52.633
-He's just a friend.
-Friend?

15:52.667 --> 15:54.100
-Whose care is that?
-We don't know.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.433
-You don't know?
-No.

15:55.467 --> 15:57.633
We met the guy over there.
He said he was a friend,

15:57.667 --> 15:59.333
so we walked over here
and got in the car

15:59.367 --> 16:01.200
and he said--
the guy said he was
gonna be right back.

16:01.233 --> 16:03.133
-You got in the car with him?
-Yeah.

16:03.167 --> 16:05.333
I swear.
-Okay 'cause they have
cameras here too.

16:05.367 --> 16:06.600
You know that, right?
-Yeah.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.400
-Okay, so it's not gonna
show you guys driving up

16:08.433 --> 16:10.533
in the car and getting out?
-I hope not.

16:10.567 --> 16:12.533
-Well, I'm asking you.
-No.

16:12.567 --> 16:15.167
-So did you get here
in that car?
-No, I did not.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.400
-Did you get here
in that car? It's--
-No. No.

16:17.433 --> 16:18.700
I walked from
across the street.

16:18.733 --> 16:20.233
-Both of you guys did.
-Yes.

16:20.267 --> 16:22.333
-Or he was in the car.
-He walked. We both
walked across the street.

16:22.367 --> 16:26.133
-Okay. I'm gonna go
talk to him and we'll
figure it out, okay?

16:26.167 --> 16:27.433
Thank you.

16:29.900 --> 16:31.167
Hello, sir.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.600
What were you doing
in that car?

16:32.633 --> 16:34.067
-I wasn't doing nothing
in that car.

16:34.067 --> 16:35.533
-Well, you were inside.

16:35.567 --> 16:37.767
-No, I wasn't.
I don't know which one
you're talking about.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.667
-That white Honda
you walked away from.
-No.

16:39.700 --> 16:42.300
-When I put my spotlight
on that car.
-No, I wasn't. No.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.567
-No?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.100
I was standing
outside of it.

16:45.133 --> 16:46.767
-Okay.
-Right next to that car.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.700
So you know what car
I'm talking about, right?

16:48.733 --> 16:50.900
-I was standing right there
next to that van.

16:50.933 --> 16:51.933
-Okay.

16:53.133 --> 16:55.433
Who does that car belong to?

16:55.467 --> 16:56.833
-The van?
-The Honda.

16:56.867 --> 16:58.233
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

16:58.267 --> 17:00.600
-(clears throat)
-Okay.

17:00.633 --> 17:03.300
What's your relation
with that girl?

17:03.333 --> 17:05.200
-She's one of my good friends.
-One of your good friends?

17:05.233 --> 17:06.233
What's her name?

17:06.267 --> 17:08.167
-Um, I'm not gonna
say her name, dude.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.800
-Okay. Well--

17:09.833 --> 17:11.533
-I'm sure she told you that.

17:11.567 --> 17:13.200
-And she told me
a lot of other things

17:13.233 --> 17:15.300
and that's why
I'm not believing
what you're telling me.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.300
-Well--
-You don't know
who it belongs to then?

17:17.333 --> 17:19.100
-I don't know, man.
-Did someone loan it to you?

17:19.133 --> 17:20.433
Did...

17:20.467 --> 17:21.533
-(sighs)

17:21.567 --> 17:22.933
Oh, my God, dude.

17:22.967 --> 17:24.933
-I'm just giving
you an opportunity
to explain yourself.

17:24.967 --> 17:27.700
-My buddy told me to come,
so I had to sit in
the freaking car, dude.

17:27.733 --> 17:29.067
-Okay.
-Damn.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.767
I was trying to get
some freaking (bleep).

17:30.800 --> 17:32.700
I was trying to get
some (bleep), dude.

17:32.733 --> 17:33.733
-Okay.

17:34.733 --> 17:36.667
-So that's why
you were in the car?

17:36.700 --> 17:38.233
-He told me to go out there
and sit in the car.

17:38.267 --> 17:39.400
-Okay. All right.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.600
I'll be back.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.733
Did he bring you
in that car here

17:46.767 --> 17:49.100
from the 99 Cents Store?
-No. No.

17:49.133 --> 17:51.633
-Okay. 'Cause I'm gonna
review video right now

17:51.667 --> 17:55.067
as far as this place goes,
and if I see you pulling up

17:55.100 --> 17:56.600
in that car, you're gonna
be going too, okay?

17:56.633 --> 17:57.933
So, I...

17:57.967 --> 18:00.067
-Okay.
-Because I don't think
you want to go to jail

18:00.100 --> 18:02.300
for something
you didn't do, okay?
-I don't want to go to jail.

18:02.333 --> 18:03.800
-So, if you want
to start over,

18:03.833 --> 18:05.967
I'll give you
the opportunity to do so, okay?

18:06.067 --> 18:07.333
-Yeah, we drove over here.

18:07.367 --> 18:08.933
-Did he drive
or did you drive?

18:08.967 --> 18:11.067
-He did.
-He did? Okay. From where?

18:11.100 --> 18:13.533
-From the 99 Cents Store.
-99 Cents Store?

18:13.567 --> 18:16.333
Did he pick you up?
Did you guys go in that car

18:16.367 --> 18:17.533
to the Walgreens?

18:17.567 --> 18:18.800
No? How'd you go
to Walgreens then?

18:18.833 --> 18:20.267
-I went with my mom.
-Your mom?

18:20.300 --> 18:21.833
-And he picked you up there?

18:21.867 --> 18:23.900
-No, he picked me up
at the 99 Cents Store, yeah.

18:23.933 --> 18:25.533
-And what were you guys
gonna do here?

18:25.567 --> 18:27.367
-He was gonna meet somebody.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.733
I don't know who.
-Okay.

18:28.767 --> 18:30.600
-I don't know.
-Did you know
that car was stolen?

18:30.633 --> 18:31.767
Did he?

18:31.800 --> 18:33.767
-I don't think so.
-Did he tell you anything?

18:33.800 --> 18:34.933
-No, he didn't say anything.
-No?

18:34.967 --> 18:37.400
-I don't think so. I don't...
-Okay.

18:37.433 --> 18:38.867
I appreciate your honesty.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.367
-I don't think he knew
it was stolen.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.100
-Well, you're not gonna
go to jail, okay?

18:42.133 --> 18:43.900
-I know, but I don't want him--

18:43.933 --> 18:46.433
I don't want him to feel
like I got him in trouble.

18:46.467 --> 18:50.167
-No, either way, he was--
he's gonna go to jail, okay?

18:51.400 --> 18:54.333
So, you need to...
you need to...

18:54.367 --> 18:56.300
be smarter about your choices.
-I know.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.200
-Okay?
-I know. You're right.

18:58.233 --> 19:00.367
I'm sorry. (bleep)

19:01.667 --> 19:02.833
-(car door opens)

19:02.867 --> 19:05.800
-Augustine, well, she said
you were driving the car.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.100
-I wasn't driving.
-Okay?

19:07.133 --> 19:08.533
-I just told you, man.

19:08.567 --> 19:10.833
-I would appreciate
if you were honest, okay?
I am being honest.

19:10.867 --> 19:13.333
-I just told you--
-Just like she was
honest with me.

19:13.367 --> 19:14.633
All right? Um--

19:14.667 --> 19:16.933
-He told me to take it.
I took it to pick her up, dude.

19:16.967 --> 19:20.200
-Okay. Do you usually
just borrow cars like that
from people?

19:20.233 --> 19:21.633
-No, he told me--
He's my homeboy.

19:21.667 --> 19:22.867
He's my good friend.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.800
-Okay.
-Told me to take the car.
"Go pick her up."

19:24.833 --> 19:26.333
-A good friend told you
to take the car

19:26.367 --> 19:28.367
and now you're going to jail?
-That's what I'm saying. Right?

19:28.400 --> 19:31.667
-All right, well,
you need to...

19:31.700 --> 19:33.367
figure out who you're
hanging out with.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.600
-Yeah.
-All right?

19:34.633 --> 19:37.200
-Unfortunately, you're gonna
be going to county jail.

19:37.233 --> 19:38.933
-What am I being
charged with exactly?

19:38.967 --> 19:41.367
-You're gonna be going to
country jail for possession
of stolen vehicle. Okay?

19:41.400 --> 19:42.833
-So possession
of stolen property?
-Yeah.

19:42.867 --> 19:45.300
No, stolen vehicle.
Same thing. All right?

19:45.333 --> 19:46.333
-Yeah. Let's go.
-Okay.

19:46.367 --> 19:48.067
Well, appreciate it, okay?

19:48.067 --> 19:49.067
Thank you.

19:49.067 --> 19:50.067
-(door closes)

19:51.700 --> 19:54.067
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.500
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:55.533 --> 19:56.633
Cover is code three.

19:56.667 --> 20:00.700
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.700 --> 20:07.667
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.200
