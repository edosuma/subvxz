WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.968
[theme music playing]

00:11.312 --> 00:13.145
well, don't you look cute.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.747
Oh, thanks. [chuckles]

00:14.815 --> 00:16.281
I hope you don't mind
I borrowed your jeans.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.018
Ugh, keep them. I bought them
like ten pounds ago.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.886
Tell dad I'll be back
in about an hour.

00:20.955 --> 00:23.088
Hey, hey, we got a new mystery.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.256
Oh.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.291
Dad, what's on your face?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.694
Birthday cake.
I just ate a birthday cake.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.763
-Whose birthday is it?
-Nobody.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.664
They sell them
at the grocery store.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.600
You can get them
anytime you want,

00:34.668 --> 00:36.301
even if it's not your birthday.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.104
Okay. So, what's the mystery.

00:39.173 --> 00:42.274
Here, you read it.
I don't feel well,
I don't know why.

00:42.343 --> 00:46.178
All I had today
is a can of sardines
and a birthday cake,

00:46.247 --> 00:47.846
so it's not that.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.715
But my stomach does hurt.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.785
I bet it's that stress.
I've been under
so much stress lately.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.453
"dear mike tyson mystery team.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.855
Please help me find
my beloved perry.

00:56.924 --> 01:00.192
We've spent every day together
for the last 53 years.

01:00.261 --> 01:03.495
But then, Sunday morning,
we were enjoying our breakfast,

01:03.564 --> 01:05.531
and I looked up
and he was gone.

01:05.599 --> 01:06.965
Perry is quite old

01:07.034 --> 01:09.068
and I worry
he'll become disoriented

01:09.136 --> 01:10.869
and won't remember
where he lives.

01:10.938 --> 01:14.606
Please hurry.
Yours, very truly,
miriam shulwitz."

01:14.675 --> 01:16.475
oh, that's terrible.

01:16.544 --> 01:19.144
She must be so worried
about her husband.
Okay, we should hurry.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.547
Wait, weren't... Weren't you
about to go somewhere?

01:21.615 --> 01:22.881
Well, yeah, but it can wait.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.183
I mean,
nothing's more important than

01:24.251 --> 01:26.185
finding some poor old man
with dementia.

01:26.253 --> 01:29.755
[pigeon laughs] yeah,
what about finding
some rich young gal

01:29.824 --> 01:31.924
with "touch my titties"
syndrome?

01:31.992 --> 01:33.492
I mean, I think that would be
more important.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.928
It would be
more important to me.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.563
[miriam] oh, thank goodness.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.165
I just know
you'll find my perry.

01:40.234 --> 01:43.168
He must feel
so scared and alone.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.104
Come. Come inside.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.875
This way, this way.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.944
[groans] what is that smell?

01:52.012 --> 01:54.146
I'll tell you what it is.
It's old people.

01:54.215 --> 01:57.349
That smell is decades
of old people, literally.

01:57.418 --> 02:00.052
The air is filled with
tiny particles
of their old skin

02:00.121 --> 02:02.921
as it sloughs off
their old withered bodies.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.424
You're breathing them in,
they're inside of you.

02:05.493 --> 02:08.894
No different than if they'd
forced themselves on you
sexually.

02:08.963 --> 02:12.698
-Pigeon!
-Oh, she can't hear me.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.733
Here, here, right here.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.835
I was sitting here.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.538
I was having my juice
and a buttered egg.

02:19.607 --> 02:20.873
Ooh, what's a buttered egg?

02:20.941 --> 02:22.641
It's a poached egg.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.376
Then why did you call it
buttered egg?

02:24.445 --> 02:27.479
-What?
-Why did you call it
a buttered egg?

02:27.548 --> 02:30.782
-What?
-[loudly] why did you call it
a buttered egg?

02:30.851 --> 02:32.718
-What?
-Oh, my god.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.820
[mike] why did you call it
a buttered egg?

02:34.889 --> 02:36.288
-[laughs]
-[miriam] what?

02:36.357 --> 02:38.957
Ah, shit, this is good.
This is so [bleep] crazy.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.759
Ask her again, mike.
Ask her again.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.295
[loudly] why did you call it
a buttered egg?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.164
Yes, for breakfast.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.466
And that's when
I looked up here.

02:47.535 --> 02:51.937
You see, I noticed that perry
was not in his cage.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.139
And I had opened
the window here.

02:54.208 --> 02:57.709
You see, because the house
was warm that day

02:57.778 --> 02:59.478
and there was a smell.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.213
A musty smell.

03:01.282 --> 03:04.449
I don't know
what the smell was.

03:04.518 --> 03:08.587
So, I opened the window
and he must have flown away.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.255
Wait, wait.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.857
Perry's a bird?

03:11.926 --> 03:14.660
Perry's a parrot.
Perry the parrot?

03:14.728 --> 03:17.429
Oh, my [bleep] god!

03:17.498 --> 03:18.764
What's that, little boy?

03:18.832 --> 03:20.832
You want a buttered egg?

03:21.936 --> 03:24.369
-[marquess] yung, wha--
-[door closes]

03:24.438 --> 03:26.104
that seemed very unlike her.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.339
Or am I wrong?

03:27.408 --> 03:29.308
Was that very like her?

03:29.376 --> 03:30.909
I don't really know yung.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.012
Yung. Yung.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.782
-What is going on?
-We rushed over here, marquess,

03:36.850 --> 03:38.750
for a bird!

03:38.819 --> 03:41.320
-I mean, it's just a waste.
-Okay, now, now,
no mystery is a waste, yung.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.722
I'm not talking about
the mystery.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.558
I'm talking about my life.
What am I doing?

03:46.627 --> 03:48.760
I'm 19. I'm not in college,

03:48.829 --> 03:50.362
-I have no friends.
-What?

03:50.431 --> 03:53.065
What about cassie
from the episode
entitled "spring break"?

03:53.133 --> 03:55.100
-No, she got a boyfriend.
-Oh.

03:55.169 --> 03:57.669
I barely talk to her anymore.
I mean, that's another thing
I don't have.

03:57.738 --> 04:01.406
What? Wait, what about
that religious boy
from the episode...

04:01.475 --> 04:03.275
Oh, what was it called? No...

04:03.344 --> 04:05.277
It had jerry jones in it
as god.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.346
I don't know.
It had a crazy ending.
I don't like those.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.983
I like these character moments.
Hmm? Like this one?

04:11.051 --> 04:12.684
Do you wanna know
where I was going this morning?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.653
-[cell phone buzzes]
-ah. Hmm.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.822
Mmm. Okay. No.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.690
Where were you going?

04:18.759 --> 04:21.593
-To interview for a job.
-Oh, my god, that's amazing.
What was the job?

04:21.662 --> 04:22.961
-[cell phone buzzes]
-oh.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.830
-Do you need to get that?
-Mmm, no. No.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.799
-[cell phone buzzes]
-you know what?
Let me just, real quick...

04:27.868 --> 04:29.234
There, let me just...

04:30.571 --> 04:34.172
Okay. Okay. So you were...
Hmm, what were you...

04:34.241 --> 04:36.074
Oh, you were getting a job!
Okay, okay, here we go.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.609
You were getting a job.
That's great.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.979
It's nothing great.
It's just a store at the mall.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.381
I'm sure I wouldn't
have gotten it anyway

04:42.449 --> 04:44.116
'cause I don't even have
any sales experience.

04:44.184 --> 04:48.387
I only know how to do this,
whatever the hell this is.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.322
-[sighs] I don't know.
I just feel like I'm lost.
-[cell phone buzzes]

04:50.391 --> 04:52.457
-like I'm--
-yeah. Mmm. Okay.
Mmm. All right.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.860
Just... Just give me two secs.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.630
Who is that?
Who are you talking to?

04:58.699 --> 04:59.865
Oh, it's just this guy.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.566
He keeps dming me.
It's nothing.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.402
-[cell phone buzzes]
-oh. Oh!

05:03.470 --> 05:04.836
Oh, hello!

05:04.905 --> 05:07.105
Dick pic at 11:00
in the morning?
[chuckles]

05:07.174 --> 05:09.274
how am I supposed to respond?
"impressive"?

05:09.343 --> 05:11.943
Mmm, you know what?
Yeah, I'll write "impressive."

05:12.713 --> 05:14.012
okay, back to you.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.114
You're in a crisis
and I am here for you.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.616
So, you wanna work at the mall.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.885
-[cell phone buzzes]
-uh, mmm, hold on. [grunts]

05:19.953 --> 05:21.620
[gasps] he wants to meet up.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.356
Oh, my god. He wants to meet up
and I'm on a mystery. Classic.

05:24.425 --> 05:28.126
We sit around for days
with no mysteries
and my phone doesn't ring,

05:28.195 --> 05:32.030
and then the second you get
a nice hard [bleep] like this
on your phone,

05:32.099 --> 05:33.932
you're on a gd mystery.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.567
Hmm, okay,
so you were saying, yung?

05:35.636 --> 05:38.637
-Never mind.
-Good, I wanna
get back to this guy.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.773
I don't get it.
This is just a poached egg.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.742
There's no butter taste at all.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.511
-[crying]
-no, no, I like it. I like it.

05:46.580 --> 05:50.716
It's buttery and delicious.
So buttery, so buttery.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.752
I just miss perry so much.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.954
I can't have lost him.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.724
I just can't bear it.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.826
I mean, you understand.

06:00.894 --> 06:05.197
You brought your bird with you.
You love him so much.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.499
That's how I was with perry.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.501
And perry could talk.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.936
Does your bird talk?

06:11.004 --> 06:14.306
I've been talking
this whole time, you old bag!

06:14.375 --> 06:18.110
My perry could make
all sorts of sounds.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.479
He could mimic anything.

06:20.547 --> 06:24.282
The phone ringing,
the faucet dripping,

06:24.351 --> 06:27.486
and people's voices
too! [inhales]

06:27.554 --> 06:31.923
oh, he would say things
my late husband, albert,
used to say.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.960
And it would sound
exactly like him.

06:35.028 --> 06:38.563
It was such a comfort to me
after he passed.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.933
At least I could still hear
albert's voice.

06:42.002 --> 06:45.303
[crying] but now,
I'll never hear it again.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.973
Don't worry, ma'am,
I'll find your bird.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.809
You don't happen to have
any butter, do you?

06:50.878 --> 06:53.111
For these dry, tasteless eggs?

06:55.115 --> 06:56.848
[pigeon] I mean,
this is madness!

06:56.917 --> 06:58.450
The bird got out!

06:58.519 --> 07:01.019
A bird, a flying bird!

07:01.088 --> 07:02.421
It is gone!

07:02.489 --> 07:05.056
No, not necessarily.
You don't fly away.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.125
That's because
you're very well-trained.

07:07.194 --> 07:10.028
But just to be sure,
we should clip your wings.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.897
Yung, you have
my nail clippers?

07:11.965 --> 07:15.133
I love pigeon too much.
I don't want him getting away.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.903
I'd be like the old lady,
just crying all day.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.971
This is all just
so stupid and pointless.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.340
We've been wandering around
for hours.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.543
You know,
I'm going to the mall.
See if I can get that job.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.478
What do you mean, yung?
You have a job.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.414
You're the vice president
of the mike tyson mystery team.

07:29.483 --> 07:32.317
Wait, you told me
I was the vice president.

07:32.386 --> 07:35.754
Oh, that's right.
Yung's the secretary
because she's a girl.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.122
Can I have
the car keys, please?

07:37.191 --> 07:39.357
You know what? Why don't
we all just go with you.

07:39.426 --> 07:42.661
We could use a break,
and I could use
a weiner on a stick.

07:42.729 --> 07:45.297
Oh, yeah? You're sure
you don't want one
in the [bleep].

07:45.365 --> 07:47.132
-[laughs]
-[bleep] you.

07:47.201 --> 07:48.500
And I do want one.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.802
And I'm gonna get one,
and it's this one.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.738
Whoa! Impressive!

07:53.807 --> 07:57.509
I got the job! They want me
to start training right away.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.544
-What's in there?
-It's a new parrot.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.980
We're gonna give it
to that old lady
and say it's her old parrot.

08:02.049 --> 08:05.350
And by the time she notices,
we'll have cashed the check.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.586
Since when do we charge
for mysteries?

08:07.654 --> 08:11.022
Since I became treasurer
of the mike tyson mystery team.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.691
[breathing lightly]

08:12.759 --> 08:15.760
oh, damn, she died.
Now we'll never get that check.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.163
Michael, she's sleeping.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.198
Let's just put this parrot
in the cage.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.503
[squawks]

08:24.571 --> 08:26.738
oh, for christ's sake,
the bird's right here.

08:26.807 --> 08:30.842
[squawks and mimics pigeon]
oh, for christ's sake,
the bird's right here.

08:30.911 --> 08:34.012
Now the thing with the sweaters
is you can't hang them,

08:34.081 --> 08:35.514
they have to be folded.

08:35.582 --> 08:36.948
Okay, I can do that.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.051
This is basically
all you'll be doing,
all day long,

08:40.120 --> 08:41.419
every day you're here.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.655
Girls come in
and they mess it up,

08:43.724 --> 08:45.257
and you have to do it again.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.325
And tracy the manager
is such a bitch,

08:47.394 --> 08:48.994
that sometimes
she'll mess them up

08:49.062 --> 08:50.562
just to make you do it again.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.364
There's literally
no worse job than this.

08:52.432 --> 08:55.400
And I heard about this guy,
I think it's in mexico,

08:55.469 --> 08:57.402
and his job is
to go down in the sewer,

08:57.471 --> 09:00.238
in like an old timey
deep sea diving outfit,

09:00.307 --> 09:02.440
and he's just like,
swimming in shit,

09:02.509 --> 09:04.543
and sometimes
he finds dead bodies.

09:04.611 --> 09:07.746
But at least he doesn't
work for [bleep] tracy.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.916
-[squawks]
-close the window, marquess.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.351
[squawks and mimics mike]
close the window, marquess.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.120
Close the window, marquess.

09:17.357 --> 09:20.625
[squawks and mimics albert]
I love you, miriam.
I love you, miriam.

09:20.694 --> 09:24.663
Ah, that must be him
doing her late husband,
albert's voice.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.499
-That is so touching.
-Where did you get
that gun, miriam?

09:27.568 --> 09:30.569
Wait, why are you
pointing it at me?

09:30.637 --> 09:33.038
-I'm your husband!
-Oh, damn.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.806
I'm your husband.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.775
Oh, you murdered me.

09:37.644 --> 09:39.177
[groans] why?

09:39.246 --> 09:42.180
Why, miriam, why?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.616
[miriam]
for the insurance money.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.817
[gun cocks]

09:47.220 --> 09:48.486
thanks for the ride.

09:51.024 --> 09:54.359
Hey, turn around, will you?
That's my dad's van.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.695
What are they still doing here?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.196
Pull that rug back.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.166
Now open the cellar door.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.836
Ooh, that's convenient.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.872
Lots of rooms
in the western united states
don't have basements.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.474
[miriam] now get down in there.

10:09.543 --> 10:12.911
I'm gonna shoot you dead
just like I did albert.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.846
-Dad?
-[parrot squawks]

10:14.915 --> 10:16.281
-hey!
-[gasps]

10:16.350 --> 10:17.649
-[miriam] oh! Oh!
-[yung grunting]

10:18.685 --> 10:20.885
oh, damn,
I was gonna return that.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.721
[both grunting]

10:22.789 --> 10:24.155
[thudding]

10:24.224 --> 10:25.423
[gun fires]

10:29.196 --> 10:30.395
[gasps]

10:32.733 --> 10:34.099
hey, jennifer,

10:34.167 --> 10:37.836
will you let tracy know that
I won't be at work tomorrow?

10:37.904 --> 10:39.771
I forgot I already have a job.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.775
I'm the secretary
of the mike tyson mystery team!

10:43.844 --> 10:45.844
