18:39.981 --> 18:42.221
Get the fuck on out of here, man.
Go about your business.

18:45.381 --> 18:48.381
Motherf-

18:52.542 --> 18:55.102
What the hell is this,
your merry-go-round move?

19:04.104 --> 19:05.943
Yo, I understand.

19:13.504 --> 19:15.944
Aha!

19:25.066 --> 19:26.906
Thank you.

19:38.187 --> 19:41.027
Hey. Oh, shit.

19:43.148 --> 19:46.428
I didnt know it was expired.
I never use it.

19:50.349 --> 19:52.109
So why are you out here?

19:52.269 --> 19:54.669
- What do you care?
- Im curious.

19:54.829 --> 19:56.549
Im a student
of human nature.

19:56.709 --> 19:58.830
Youre a freak
of human nature.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.670
Thats all right.
I forgive you.

20:01.830 --> 20:04.790
Its clear you have
woman problems.

20:04.950 --> 20:06.710
Youre way off base.

20:06.870 --> 20:09.430
- Im off base?
- Yeah. Way off base.

20:09.551 --> 20:11.671
- She mess around on you?
- Look.

20:11.831 --> 20:15.271
Even if I wanted to talk about it-
which I dont- it wouldn´tt be with you.

20:15.432 --> 20:18.751
You give her some nastiness? I know you
gave her some serious nastiness.

20:18.911 --> 20:22.912
- Just forget it.
- What about him? Did you fuck him up?

20:23.072 --> 20:27.633
Did you whoop his ass? I bet you hit
that motherfucker with a bat, didnt ya?

20:27.793 --> 20:30.713
Kling! Pow! Fucked his ass up,
didnt ya?

20:30.873 --> 20:34.673
No, wait a minute. You capped him. You
capped that motherfucker, didnt you?

20:34.833 --> 20:36.914
Thats why you out here
in the desert, ain´tt ya?

20:37.074 --> 20:40.074
Look. I didnt shoot him. I didn´tt say
anything to my wife. I just left.

20:40.234 --> 20:42.035
- What do you mean, you just left?
- Just left. I-

20:42.195 --> 20:44.994
I saw them doing you know...

20:45.155 --> 20:49.275
and I walked away.

20:50.795 --> 20:53.075
What a pussy.

20:53.235 --> 20:57.036
No wonder your woman
is sneaking behind your back, man.

20:57.196 --> 21:00.796
Know what your problem is? You dont
have the respect of your woman, man.

21:00.957 --> 21:03.196
Thats what it is.
Me, I got all that.

21:03.356 --> 21:05.157
I go home, my dinners
on the table.

21:05.317 --> 21:07.237
Bam! I dont wanna
hear shit, woman.

21:07.397 --> 21:11.278
- And if I want lovin- if I´mm in the mood- I get that
too. - You´rre so full of shit. What would you have done?

21:11.437 --> 21:14.678
Man, I would have went back to that house and
Id have pulled a Terminator on the front door.

21:14.838 --> 21:18.519
Boom, boom, boom! Who the fuck do you
think youre playin´ with, woman?

21:18.679 --> 21:22.239
Who do you think I am, some fruity pie?
I aint no fruity pie.

21:22.399 --> 21:24.759
Im- I´mm Nick Beam.

21:24.919 --> 21:26.679
Thats what I told her.
I´mm Nick Beam.

21:26.839 --> 21:30.880
And Nick Beam aint puttin´ up
with that bullshit.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.000
Shed have been crying, you know? ´´´OOh,
Nick, oh, Nick, please take me back.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.120
Please, please, Nick.
It was only one time. ´

21:36.280 --> 21:40.001
Im gonna ´´´oone time´´´ your ass.
Nick Beam is the master of his fate...

21:40.161 --> 21:41.921
the ruler of his destiny.

21:42.081 --> 21:45.761
So if you wanna cry on somebodys
shoulder, why don´tt you cry on Superdick?

21:45.921 --> 21:48.322
As for Nick Beam,
Im fit, lit...

21:48.481 --> 21:51.202
and I damn sure
aint takin´ no shit.

21:51.362 --> 21:55.922
So you can get the fuck out.

21:57.883 --> 22:00.363
Thats what I woulda
told the bitch.

22:00.523 --> 22:03.323
Thats what I
told the bitch.

22:06.924 --> 22:09.364
- What the-
- Hey, hold it. Hold it.

22:09.524 --> 22:11.804
Break it up. Break it up.

22:13.525 --> 22:16.165
Should I pay cash, or do you

22:40.887 --> 22:45.288
Ah, fu- Oh- Ah-

22:58.729 --> 23:00.489

23:00.649 --> 23:03.690
- What do you think youre doing?
- There´ss a special they got goin´ on.

23:03.850 --> 23:07.210
You get a free stack of cash
with every fill-up. Some luck, huh?

23:07.370 --> 23:09.611
How stupid can you be?

23:09.771 --> 23:12.531
- We better get out of here.
- You take that money back.

23:12.692 --> 23:16.492

23:16.652 --> 23:20.612

23:20.772 --> 23:22.252
Here we go.

23:29.533 --> 23:33.413
- Why? Why? Why?
- I didnt have any money, man.

23:33.573 --> 23:38.134
- Oh, you had money.
- No. No. That five dollars I gave the waitress was it.

23:38.294 --> 23:42.374
- What the-
- Oh, great. Bufords come to kill us.

23:47.055 --> 23:50.416
- Persistent hillbilly motherfucker.
- He has every right to be.

23:50.575 --> 23:53.536
You robbed him at gunpoint.
You dick!

23:53.696 --> 23:58.576
Hey, hey, youre the one who threw
the wallet out the fuckin´ window.

23:58.736 --> 24:00.977
Smart.

24:01.136 --> 24:02.177
Great!

24:05.937 --> 24:08.817
Oh, shit.

24:11.458 --> 24:14.578
- All right, man. What you doin?
- Come on, asshole.

24:16.498 --> 24:20.659
Well, would you look
at these crazy sons a bitches?

24:20.819 --> 24:23.219
Oh, shit. We gonna die.
Pull off the fuckin road.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.859
Man, would you pull
off the fuckin road!

24:26.019 --> 24:28.500
Oh, shit!

24:28.660 --> 24:31.460
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit.

24:52.943 --> 24:55.062
Hey, Earl.

25:05.824 --> 25:07.783
Oh, sh-

25:07.944 --> 25:11.704
Im alive! You alive!

25:11.865 --> 25:13.905
Howd you know that hillbilly
was gonna turn first?

25:14.065 --> 25:18.385
You did know he was gonna
turn first, didnt ya?

25:18.545 --> 25:21.505
You know what?
It dont even matter.

25:21.665 --> 25:24.466
Im alive!
You alive, man!

25:36.187 --> 25:38.748
- Get out! -
What? - Get out!

25:48.268 --> 25:50.068
What are you even thinking when
you do something like that?

25:50.229 --> 25:52.789
- You think youre never gonna get caught?
- We didn´tt get caught.

25:52.909 --> 25:55.389
Thats not the point.
It´ss beetleheaded.

25:55.549 --> 25:57.430
Its- It´ss only a matter of time
before you do get caught.

25:57.589 --> 26:01.790
- What is beetleheaded?
- Its a synonym for ´´´sstupid. ´´´

26:01.950 --> 26:06.910
Oh. Well, heres a synonym
for ´´´pprocreation. ´´´ Fuck you!

26:07.070 --> 26:10.750
Its easy for you to point the finger when you´rre
sittin´ on your rich ass in a big fuckin´ house.

26:10.911 --> 26:13.551
- Im not rich.
- Oh, yeah.

26:13.711 --> 26:15.112
- How bigs your TV?
- What?

26:15.272 --> 26:17.351
- I say, how bigs your TV?
- Fifty-inch.

26:17.512 --> 26:20.832
- Get in the car.
- Oh, please. Lets not make this a social issue.

26:20.992 --> 26:24.472
The point is that even if you wanted to rob
a place, there are smarter ways to do it.

26:24.632 --> 26:28.193
- Enlighten me.
- A mask. Wear a mask.

26:28.353 --> 26:30.354
You see, the police
have this thing called a ´llineup... ´´´

26:30.513 --> 26:33.673
and if someone recognizes you,
you go to jail!

26:33.833 --> 26:36.553
Oh, how about this for a novel idea?
Case the place first.

26:36.714 --> 26:40.434
Find out if theres a security camera
or a hidden alarm.

26:40.594 --> 26:43.235
Then again, why even rob
a convenience store?

26:43.395 --> 26:45.474
How much money could you possibly get?
Two, three hundred dollars?

26:45.635 --> 26:47.715
Then what? Youre set
for two days! Wow!

26:47.875 --> 26:50.796
- What do you know, lanky?
- I know you go for the big score.

26:50.955 --> 26:52.516
One robbery, youre set.

26:52.676 --> 26:55.876
News flash, big slim.

26:56.036 --> 26:57.956
People with big money,
they protect it.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.917
So you do a little research.
Take Quality Design Group where I work.

27:01.077 --> 27:03.436
My boss keeps a ton of cash
in his vault.

27:03.597 --> 27:06.597
At night, theres only two guards
and a personal security system.

27:06.757 --> 27:09.517
Now, in this case,
I happen to even know the code.

27:09.678 --> 27:12.038
But even if I didnt, I-

27:15.598 --> 27:17.438
What?

27:21.119 --> 27:23.399
I got a booger in my nose?

27:24.359 --> 27:27.000
What?

27:27.159 --> 27:29.079
Diversify.

27:29.239 --> 27:31.480
You cant trust banks, Nick.

27:31.640 --> 27:35.960
The entire system
could crumble at any second.

27:36.120 --> 27:39.640
That bastards so heavily leveraged,
it would wipe him out.

27:39.801 --> 27:43.322
Wait a minute.
Am I hearing you right?

27:43.481 --> 27:46.361
Mr ´HHigh and Mighty´´´
is gonna rob his boss?

27:49.242 --> 27:52.362
You hear that,
gila monsters?

27:52.523 --> 27:55.083
Old Nick Beam here
is gonna rob his boss!

27:55.203 --> 27:59.323
I say, do you hear that,
gila monsters?

27:59.483 --> 28:03.243
You know what, Nick? Your wife really
messed your head up bad, man.

28:06.803 --> 28:08.804
Youre serious?

28:11.045 --> 28:15.405
- How much he got?
- Only the bulk of his personal assets.

28:15.565 --> 28:20.565
- Six, seven hundred thousand.
- You what?

28:20.725 --> 28:23.726
- Hey, you gonna need some help.
- Oh, no, this has nothing to do with you.

28:23.886 --> 28:27.726
Hey, I was present at the time
of creative inspiration...

28:27.886 --> 28:30.126
which entitles me
to partial ownership...

28:30.286 --> 28:33.566
in this
criminalistic endeavour.

28:33.727 --> 28:37.807
- Get out.
- Maybe Ill just call Quality Design Group when we get back.

28:40.888 --> 28:42.207
I want half.

28:44.768 --> 28:47.208
Were gonna bury
this asshole.

28:47.369 --> 28:49.208
Sure, youre right.

28:58.050 --> 29:00.849
If you ever plan

29:01.010 --> 29:02.770
To motor West

29:04.850 --> 29:07.730
Travel my way
Take the highway

29:07.891 --> 29:10.691
Thats the best

29:10.851 --> 29:13.572
Come on
Get your kicks

29:13.732 --> 29:15.571
On Route Sixty-

29:25.253 --> 29:27.013
Six

29:28.773 --> 29:31.414
Well, it winds from Chicago

29:31.574 --> 29:33.413
To L.A.

29:35.573 --> 29:38.214
More than 2,000 miles

29:41.135 --> 29:44.695
- Highway shooters?
- One black, one white. You tell me?

29:44.855 --> 29:46.575
You were there,
and they got away?

29:46.735 --> 29:50.575
They were driving
a 1996 Yukon.

29:52.976 --> 29:56.976
- Licence?
- You know, if I had a licence number, Bart, I wouldnt be standing here...

29:57.136 --> 29:59.537
- eating large quantities of shit, now, would I?
- No, sir.

29:59.697 --> 30:04.057
Monitor calls on both sides of the border.
Fax that photo to every precinct on the planet.

30:04.217 --> 30:08.417
Theres so much as a sneeze
out there I wanna feel the mist.

30:19.859 --> 30:23.059
I hear a voice

30:23.219 --> 30:25.460
- Give me all your money and a Yoo Hoo.
- The moneys all locked up.

30:29.380 --> 30:31.620
Thatll be 79 cents, please.

30:34.460 --> 30:36.220
I said
Come on, little prisoner

30:36.380 --> 30:38.940
I got something to say

30:49.382 --> 30:52.262
Something stinks, man.

30:52.422 --> 30:54.862
You sure you aint got
a gas leak?

30:55.022 --> 30:58.423
- Its my shoes.
- Your shoes?

31:01.023 --> 31:03.103
You ever heard of Dr Scholls?

31:03.263 --> 31:06.424
I spilled some gas on my shoes
at the gas station.

31:06.584 --> 31:09.144
You know,
the one you robbed.

31:10.784 --> 31:13.664
- Oh, so you got a camcorder up in here.
- What are you doing?

31:13.825 --> 31:15.225
Im just
checkin´ it out, man.

31:15.385 --> 31:17.985
- Pu- Pu- Put it down.
- I aint gonna break it, man.

31:18.146 --> 31:21.505
Just let me check it out.
Just let me see.

31:23.186 --> 31:24.946
Yo, this is your wife?

31:25.106 --> 31:29.346
Man, I see why
you were upset.

31:29.507 --> 31:33.067
Not bad, Nick.
Not bad, Nick.

31:33.227 --> 31:35.187
I mean, you know,
for a cheatin bitch.

31:35.347 --> 31:37.628
Look, dont you call her that.

31:37.787 --> 31:39.908
You- You dont know her.
Don´tt call her that.

31:40.068 --> 31:42.828
Okay. No disrespect. Okay?

31:44.348 --> 31:46.149
What should I call her?

31:46.308 --> 31:49.669
Monogamously challenged?

31:51.549 --> 31:53.669
- God.
- I was just fuckin with you, man.

31:53.830 --> 31:55.750
You know, this is an all right camera
for a regular eight.

31:55.909 --> 31:59.510
- Its the best on the market.
- Let me explain something to you, Nick.

31:59.670 --> 32:03.070
If you aint got digital,
you ain´tt got shit.

32:03.230 --> 32:05.471
This has only got
one C.C.D. chip.

32:05.630 --> 32:08.351
Broadcast has three, Nick.

32:08.510 --> 32:11.871
Dont look at me like that.
What, are you surprised I know shit?

32:12.031 --> 32:15.271
The guy that sold me that camera
just set up our computer network.

32:15.432 --> 32:19.112
- Windows NT?
- No. Just Windows.

32:19.272 --> 32:22.193
- Man, get out of here with that shit.
- Look, heres a nutty idea.

32:22.353 --> 32:26.153
If you actually know something about this
stuff, why not use that knowledge and get a job?

32:26.313 --> 32:28.153
Take a good look at me.

32:28.313 --> 32:31.033
- Im not exactly the corporate colour.
- That´ss ridiculous.

32:31.193 --> 32:34.794
- If you wanted a job, you could have one.
- Theres a spider on your head.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.794
- What?
- Theres a spider on your head.

32:37.954 --> 32:40.315
Look, I am sorry.
I am not up on all this...

32:40.474 --> 32:42.235
jive-talkin, homeboy lingo.

32:42.394 --> 32:45.355
Whats that supposed to mean,
there´ss a spider on your head?

32:45.515 --> 32:49.475
It means: Theres a spider on
your motherfuckin´ head, man.

32:49.636 --> 32:52.196
Well, get it off!
Get it off, get it off!

32:52.356 --> 32:54.796

32:54.956 --> 32:56.716
Get it off, get it off,

32:56.876 --> 33:01.157
- Get it off!
- Yo, thats a big fuckin´ spider, man.

33:01.317 --> 33:02.957
Oh, shit!

33:08.678 --> 33:11.038
Nick, its just a spider.

33:11.198 --> 33:13.758
Im a scat man

33:13.918 --> 33:17.359
No, no.
Now dont go crazy.

33:17.518 --> 33:20.519
- Yeah, you go, boy.
- Im a scat man

33:22.959 --> 33:26.120
Hold on, let me focus.
Let me focus on this shit.

33:26.280 --> 33:29.640
Im a scat man

33:29.800 --> 33:32.840
Oh, shit.

33:40.361 --> 33:43.962

35:04.850 --> 35:06.610

35:09.331 --> 35:13.211
Twenty dollars on pump number 15

35:17.492 --> 35:20.612

36:22.700 --> 36:25.300
- Do you mind if I take your gun?

36:25.459 --> 36:28.739

36:28.899 --> 36:32.900

36:33.060 --> 36:37.861

36:43.782 --> 36:45.702

36:49.422 --> 36:51.462
Le- Let me get this straight.

36:51.623 --> 36:54.343
Its all right for you to rob a place,
but it ain´tt all right for me?

36:54.503 --> 36:56.263
I didnt rob him.

36:56.423 --> 36:59.343
Well, you got a funny way
of not robbin a motherfucker.

36:59.503 --> 37:01.863
Nick, lets get out of here,
man, before he calls the cops.

37:02.024 --> 37:03.784
- Hes not gonna call the cops.

37:03.944 --> 37:06.704

37:06.864 --> 37:09.784
Oh, shoot.

37:09.944 --> 37:12.145

37:54.870 --> 37:57.750
What? Oh, come on, man.
This shit is the shit.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.950
- This is the shit. Its supposed to make you sad.
- It´ss grim.

38:00.110 --> 38:01.910
Oh, man, come on.
This is the shit.

38:02.070 --> 38:06.911
This shit is the shit.
This is the hellified love music.

38:07.071 --> 38:09.351

- Ah, man, you know, maybe I can...

38:09.511 --> 38:14.151

and get you some Donny Osmond.

38:16.872 --> 38:20.592
- Charlie, whats this? Slow down.
- Get the fuck out of here.

38:20.752 --> 38:23.152
Pull over and
turn the headlights off.

38:34.034 --> 38:37.074
Yo, man, you couldve
gotten me a piece of licorice.

38:37.234 --> 38:39.474
- Its sour.
- So.

38:39.634 --> 38:41.714
Still couldve gotten me a piece.

38:41.875 --> 38:44.435
- I didnt think of it.
- Oh, you didn´tt think of it.

38:44.555 --> 38:46.996
Just selfish, man.
Guess thats the world.

38:47.155 --> 38:50.516
- You know? You just- You just selfish.
- Here.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.438
Damn.

39:09.598 --> 39:13.958
I swear, white people must got
totally different taste buds, man.

39:14.118 --> 39:16.278
Thats a very
racist thing to say.

39:16.438 --> 39:19.398
Oh, yeah? Good.

39:24.560 --> 39:27.120
What the f-

39:27.239 --> 39:30.280
- Oh, shit!

39:30.440 --> 39:34.520
Thanks for the late-breakin news.
Step on the gas, Nick!

39:34.680 --> 39:36.921
I hate new cars.

39:37.080 --> 39:39.041
Whoa!

39:42.921 --> 39:45.802
Look at his face, man.

39:45.962 --> 39:49.002
Look, man!

39:52.123 --> 39:54.763
Our turf, baby.

40:21.526 --> 40:24.166
They dont look like cops.

40:24.326 --> 40:26.167
Definitely not cops.

40:26.327 --> 40:28.887
Get out of the car.

40:31.567 --> 40:35.488
- There you go.
- All right, motherfuckers, back the fuck off!

40:40.568 --> 40:43.448
Oh, shit. Its cool.

40:45.728 --> 40:47.888
Oh, yeah, Im cool.

40:48.048 --> 40:49.809

40:49.969 --> 40:51.729
Hey, whats up?
Y´aall-Y´aall live around here?

40:51.889 --> 40:55.689

40:55.849 --> 41:00.050
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

41:00.210 --> 41:03.891

41:07.011 --> 41:09.571
Watch- Watch your feet.
There you go, baby.

41:09.731 --> 41:12.091
Perhaps you two havent heard
that my partner and I here...

41:12.252 --> 41:15.492
own the rights to all violent crime
on this particular stretch of highway.

41:15.652 --> 41:19.612
And we dont take kindly to any
unauthorized criminal activities.

41:19.772 --> 41:22.332
You dont understand.
We were-

41:22.452 --> 41:25.173
- Oh, shit.
- Thats my car.

41:25.332 --> 41:27.773
- Can I have your attention, please?
- Yeah.

41:27.933 --> 41:31.813
I bet you used to sell more Girl Scout cookies
than any other member of the whole troop, didnt ya?

41:31.974 --> 41:35.534
What were you calling yourself back
then? Yolanda, you little bitch?

41:35.694 --> 41:37.734
Cynthia? Susan? What was it?
I cant remember.

41:37.894 --> 41:40.294
- Hey, guys, I will be gentle. Dont even worry about it.
- Huh?

41:40.454 --> 41:43.335
Now- Now, dont even worry.

41:43.495 --> 41:45.815
Uh-huh.

41:47.815 --> 41:49.576
I have these.

41:49.735 --> 41:51.815
Oh, now thats not
gonna be enough.

41:51.976 --> 41:54.856
Whered you put your booty?

42:01.857 --> 42:07.017
Now Ive done it. I finally found
someone I like less than you.

42:07.177 --> 42:10.538
Shit. Thats
a fancy case, friend.

42:10.698 --> 42:13.258
You know, when a sweet-mouthed girl
like you has a fancy case like this...

42:13.418 --> 42:16.938
a man gets to thinkin
where´ss the wallet?

42:17.099 --> 42:20.139
Thats it.
We´rre dead, man.

42:20.299 --> 42:21.979
Im gonna need
that wallet, Alice.

42:22.139 --> 42:26.060
Wheres that big, fat wallet?
Give it to me.

42:26.220 --> 42:28.780
Give me your fuckin wallet,
you little bitch.

42:31.300 --> 42:33.420
- You know what?
- Nick, Nick, what you doin?

42:33.581 --> 42:35.661
Im sure you´rre
a really scary guy.

42:35.821 --> 42:39.581
Im sure that, normally, people just
quiver at the very sound of your voice.

42:39.741 --> 42:43.222
But, you see, I, I cant
see that right now.

42:43.381 --> 42:47.462
I- I-I just see a weak,
desperate little man...

42:47.621 --> 42:50.343
that probably grew up
torturing little animals.

42:50.502 --> 42:52.302
Some puny, little uncoordinated...

42:52.462 --> 42:56.743
cant-make-the-football-team- so-I´lll-pick-on-third-graders-
and-steal-their-lunch-money...

42:56.903 --> 42:59.343
punk, jerk-off bully...

42:59.503 --> 43:01.663
that one day wakes up
and realizes hes nothing.

43:01.824 --> 43:05.784
Just a sad, pathetic, useless,
illiterate piece of inbred shit.

43:06.744 --> 43:10.184
I just want you to know,
I totally disagree.

43:18.385 --> 43:21.826
- Time to die.
- That just makes you my best friend.

43:23.946 --> 43:26.547
All right,
drop the fuckin gun.

43:26.707 --> 43:29.547
Drop the fuckin gun!

43:29.707 --> 43:31.467
Give me this, motherfucker.

43:31.627 --> 43:34.347
Now back the fuck up before
I kick you in your bitch-ass chin.

43:34.507 --> 43:37.668
Back the fuck up!
I said, back the fuck up!

43:37.827 --> 43:40.628
Didnt I say, back the fuck up?
Everybody, back the fuck up.

43:40.788 --> 43:43.508
Oh!

43:44.988 --> 43:49.469
Shit.

43:49.628 --> 43:51.349
- You shot me.
- Im sorry, Nick.

43:51.509 --> 43:54.589
- Put down the gun.
- Shut up.

43:54.749 --> 43:58.230
- You shot me. - I said, Im
sorry, man. I- I-I didn´tt mean it.

43:58.390 --> 44:00.230
The gun just went off.

44:00.390 --> 44:02.631
You know, I have that
same trouble in bed.

44:02.791 --> 44:05.830
Well, rarely. Every once
in a great while.

44:05.990 --> 44:09.271
- Put down that gun, you idiot.
- Would you shut up? Im shot here.

44:09.431 --> 44:11.911
You shut the fuck up.
Who the hell do you think you are?

44:12.071 --> 44:14.392
- You shut the fuck up! You shut the fuck
up! - Huh? Look at yourself, you candy-ass-

44:14.552 --> 44:16.552
- Man, you shut the fuck up. -
You shut the fuck up. - Shut up!

44:16.712 --> 44:19.992
- Put down the gun! - Hey, hey, hey! - Put that
fucking gun down before you take a fucking toe hit.

44:20.152 --> 44:23.433
- You shut the fuck up! - I dont give a shit!
- Shut the fuck up! - Candy-ass motherfucker!

44:23.593 --> 44:26.393
- Shut the fuck up, man! - Shut

44:26.553 --> 44:29.514
Hey! Everybody,

44:29.674 --> 44:31.913
Now, everybody,
shut the fuck up!

44:32.074 --> 44:33.754
Especially you.
Shut the fuck up.

44:33.914 --> 44:36.154
You like Girl Scout cookies?
Come here. Come here.

44:36.314 --> 44:38.234
You want cookie?
Heres a cookie.

44:38.394 --> 44:41.675
Now back the fuck up like I done
told you two dumb-ass mother-

44:41.835 --> 44:43.995
Back up, back up.

44:48.316 --> 44:51.915
Get in the car, Nick!
Look at you now.

44:54.076 --> 44:55.836
Thats good.

44:55.997 --> 44:58.236
Bye, cowboys!

45:13.398 --> 45:16.399
Nick, why the hell you start up
with that guy, man?

45:16.559 --> 45:19.919
- You shot me.
- Im sorry.

45:20.079 --> 45:24.240
- You shot me.
- Im sorry.

45:24.400 --> 45:27.520
You dont say you´rre sorry
when you shoot someone.

45:27.680 --> 45:29.920
You say youre sorry when
you step on someone´ss toe...

45:30.080 --> 45:32.280
or you accidentally
break their glasses...

45:32.440 --> 45:34.440
or you, you fart
while theyre eating.

45:34.600 --> 45:37.161
You- You dont say you´rre sorry
when you shoot someone!

45:37.281 --> 45:39.642
Shit.

45:39.801 --> 45:43.202
Oh, my God. Its going numb.
It´ss going numb. It´ss going numb.

45:43.361 --> 45:46.042
What?

45:46.202 --> 45:48.482
Shit.

45:55.403 --> 45:57.723
Oh, my God!

45:57.884 --> 46:00.484
Nick, thats the most
hideous thing I ever seen.

46:00.643 --> 46:03.644
Hey, yo, man, you know,
maybe if you wrap your arm in ice...

46:03.803 --> 46:06.364
they can reattach it.

46:09.604 --> 46:12.164
Thats funny, man.

46:12.325 --> 46:15.885
- Thats a baby gash.
- Shut up.

46:16.045 --> 46:19.486
- But its a baby gash.
- It could´vve been a lot worse. It could´vve been a lot worse!

46:19.646 --> 46:22.406
- It couldve been, but it wasn´tt. I´mm
gonna- - What are you thinking, shooting?

46:22.566 --> 46:24.326
Look, just calm down,
all right?

46:24.486 --> 46:27.927
Youre gonna upset your wound.

46:48.248 --> 46:50.089
Yeah. Do you folks
want a lift somewhere?

46:50.249 --> 46:51.930
- Where you from?

46:52.089 --> 46:53.810
- Me too!
- Really?

46:53.970 --> 46:55.450

46:55.610 --> 47:00.210
Hop in me car. Lets go then.
Come on. Jump in. Let´ss go.

47:00.370 --> 47:03.971
- Oh, this is great.
- Hey, would you scoot over a smidgen?

47:06.651 --> 47:08.811
Sorry about that.
Cheers, mate.

47:13.572 --> 47:16.652
- Nick Beam.
- Where we headed?

47:16.812 --> 47:18.813

47:34.254 --> 47:37.134

47:40.175 --> 47:42.735
Thanks.
Well, just for the night.

47:42.855 --> 47:44.975
What? Did you think
I was asking you to move in?

47:45.135 --> 47:47.616
- No, I was just sayin-
- Please, Mr Beam.

47:47.775 --> 47:51.416
- Stay with me forever.
- Just shut up.

47:51.576 --> 47:54.736
- Mr Beam.
- Shut up.

47:54.897 --> 47:57.457
- Mr Beam, Mr Beam, Mr Beam.
- You know how to shut up?

47:57.617 --> 47:59.377
- Mr Beam.
- Is it in your vocabulary?

47:59.537 --> 48:01.737
- Stay with me forever, Mr Beam.
- Is it possible? Do you ever shut up?

48:01.896 --> 48:04.498
Will you stay with me
forever, Mr Beam?

48:25.740 --> 48:28.620
Look here.
When you meet my wife...

48:28.780 --> 48:30.900
she dont know nothin´
about my sideline gig.

48:31.060 --> 48:34.341
- You mean she doesnt know you´rre a thief?
- Hey, I´mm not a thief, okay?

48:34.501 --> 48:37.941
I just dabble
in future used goods.

48:38.101 --> 48:41.782
- Well, what does she think you do all day?
- Look for work, man.

48:44.342 --> 48:48.582
Maybe if you did look for work,
you wouldnt have to steal.

48:48.742 --> 48:50.902
Dont judge me.

48:58.824 --> 49:00.584
You stepped on my shoe.

49:00.744 --> 49:02.984

51:34.921 --> 51:39.322
Make your choice cause you got
to grow up to be successful

51:39.481 --> 51:42.801
- I hope this isnt an inconvenience for you.
- Not at all.

51:42.962 --> 51:47.082

51:47.242 --> 51:49.482

- But you do.

54:02.258 --> 54:06.618

I´mm committing armed robbery for two flashlights.

54:06.778 --> 54:09.698
Hey, dont worry about it.
Let´ss go.

54:26.100 --> 54:28.100
Freeze, motherfucker!

54:28.260 --> 54:32.220
You move your ass so much

54:32.380 --> 54:35.861
- You hear me, motherfucker?
- Hey. - You hear me? What?

54:36.020 --> 54:40.541
- Why you acting so mean?
- Hey, look, man. Now aint the fuckin´ time, all right?

54:40.701 --> 54:43.581
- You say scary shit, it scares em.
- Yeah, but you have a gun.

54:43.742 --> 54:46.622
Plus, what youre doing
is a stereotypical robber thing.

54:46.782 --> 54:51.703
I mean, its a lot scarier if someone with
a gun is calm and cool and collected, man.

54:51.863 --> 54:54.903
- Thats bullshit, man. Don´tt-
- Here.

54:55.063 --> 54:58.943
Excuse me, sir. Come here.

54:59.103 --> 55:03.104
Come here. Come here.

55:05.384 --> 55:08.865
Now, look, Henry...

55:09.025 --> 55:11.824
were gonna take
some things outta here...

55:11.985 --> 55:14.985
and youre just gonna
stand there.

55:17.225 --> 55:21.186
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

55:23.586 --> 55:25.347
Good.

55:27.066 --> 55:31.467
Now, honestly, which one
did you think was scarier?

55:33.347 --> 55:36.387
- Honestly?
- Mm-hmm.

55:37.868 --> 55:39.908
He was scarier.

55:40.068 --> 55:44.149
Really? You didnt find
what he did contrived?

55:44.309 --> 55:48.629
- No. It was scary.
- Well, what part?

55:48.789 --> 55:52.869
Well, the, uh, ´FFreeze, motherfucker´´´
part was scary.

55:53.029 --> 55:56.630
And then he led me to believe
that if I moved my ass...

55:56.790 --> 55:59.271
it, it might be blown off.

56:02.831 --> 56:06.591
- You were scary too.
- Oh, come on. Youre just saying that. You don´tt have to lie.

56:06.751 --> 56:09.511
No, Im not. I thought
you were very scary.

56:09.672 --> 56:11.432
- Really?
- Yeah.

56:11.592 --> 56:14.952
- Well, thank you, Henry.
- Yo, check it out.

56:15.112 --> 56:17.513
Theyre flashlights
with A.M./F.M. radio on it.

56:17.672 --> 56:21.993
They all that. You can listen to
your music while the lights on, boy.

56:22.153 --> 56:24.033
All right, all right!

56:24.193 --> 56:27.273
Come on. Come on.

56:31.673 --> 56:34.994
Freeze, sucker-bitch!

56:35.954 --> 56:37.795
That was much better.

56:37.955 --> 56:41.435
Thank you, Henry.

56:41.595 --> 56:44.396

And they got no boutiques

57:11.478 --> 57:13.479

57:13.638 --> 57:16.518
In the jungle

Yo, yo, Rig!

58:25.406 --> 58:28.447
Go, go, go, go, go, go

58:39.448 --> 58:41.288
Why cant we just

58:41.448 --> 58:44.529

- This is bullshit!

58:45.688 --> 58:47.769

58:52.650 --> 58:56.090
You seriously busted up my party.
You know that.

58:56.249 --> 58:58.730
Those girls were attracted to you. I

58:58.890 --> 59:01.370
- Youre a handsome man. We will go back.
- I´lll hold you to that.

59:01.531 --> 59:04.171

59:21.973 --> 59:24.573
Beat me at what?
Climbing steps?

59:25.973 --> 59:28.574
Guess well call you

59:33.974 --> 59:35.974

59:45.535 --> 59:48.296

59:50.056 --> 59:54.296

Step aside. Let me take a look.
Let me take a look.

59:57.137 --> 59:59.097
Okay, let me look.
Mm-hmm.

01:00:01.938 --> 01:00:06.258
- What are you gonna do?
- You got 12 possible stations here. Youre only using seven.

01:00:06.418 --> 01:00:10.178
Im gonna make the other five stations
active, run a test mode...

01:00:10.338 --> 01:00:12.578
and force the system
into rotation.

01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:14.699
What does that mean?

01:00:17.779 --> 01:00:19.900
We got five minutes.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:31.141
Here. Put on your mask.

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.781
Is that mask sweaty? I think
thats the one I hid behind my balls.

01:00:36.861 --> 01:00:38.301

Hows it feel, Phillip?

01:02:34.274 --> 01:02:38.675
You had it all, but it wasnt enough
for you. You had to mess with me.

01:02:40.155 --> 01:02:43.035
Nobody messes with Nick Beam.

01:03:12.719 --> 01:03:14.958
I feel lucky

01:03:16.119 --> 01:03:18.719
I just feel that way

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.920
Im on a bus to Atlantic City

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.520
Later on today

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.921

01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:38.402
It does matter. They catch you,

01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:43.522

Hmm. The alarm

01:05:16.532 --> 01:05:20.212
Addressing the groove
I see youre drinkin´ again

01:05:20.372 --> 01:05:24.293
Youre smokin´ smack inside your
cigarettes and lookin´ pale and thin

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:26.453
Its a shame

01:05:26.614 --> 01:05:29.494
Its a pity in New York City

01:05:30.894 --> 01:05:32.974
Well

01:05:48.016 --> 01:05:51.016
Well, well, well

01:05:51.176 --> 01:05:53.897
Something has changed

01:05:54.057 --> 01:05:56.136
The way these people think

01:06:04.858 --> 01:06:10.018
Hey there, lonely girl

01:06:10.178 --> 01:06:13.259
Lonely girl

01:06:13.419 --> 01:06:18.339
Let me make your
broken heart like new

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.740
- Oh, shit.
- Hey there, lonely-

01:06:34.701 --> 01:06:36.462
White people.

01:06:43.262 --> 01:06:45.422
Our dates.

01:07:03.344 --> 01:07:05.545
Ohh, shit.

01:07:05.704 --> 01:07:07.865
Oh-ho-ho.
Look at this, man!

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:12.305
Mama-say, mama-sa, makusa!
Oh, smack me two times!

01:07:12.465 --> 01:07:14.265
Calm down.

01:07:14.426 --> 01:07:16.866
My son is going
to the best schools.

01:07:17.026 --> 01:07:19.746
My daughter, she aint even
gonna know what a food stamp is.

01:07:19.906 --> 01:07:23.826
My wife,
we goin out all the time.

01:07:23.986 --> 01:07:25.787
All the time!

01:07:29.507 --> 01:07:32.828
- Whats wrong with you, man?
- Nothing.

01:07:32.987 --> 01:07:35.548
You sweatin that bullshit, ain´tt you?
You sweatin´ that bullshit.

01:07:35.668 --> 01:07:38.228
You did what you had to do
to that guy, man. Dont worry about it.

01:07:38.348 --> 01:07:41.028
All right? Put that shit
behind you, man. Where you goin?

01:07:41.189 --> 01:07:44.989
Where you goin?
Where you goin´??

01:07:45.149 --> 01:07:47.309
Im just gonna-
I´mm just gonna take a walk.

01:07:47.469 --> 01:07:49.229
All right.
Well, hurry back.

01:07:49.389 --> 01:07:52.150
I got willpower,
but I dont know how much.

01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:55.670
You know what Im sayin´??
Yeah.

01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:57.950
There is somethin

01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:01.710
On your mind

01:08:05.671 --> 01:08:10.031
By the way
you look at me

01:08:14.472 --> 01:08:16.593
There is somethin

01:08:16.752 --> 01:08:20.792
On your mind, honey

01:08:24.313 --> 01:08:27.513
Did you ever do somethin that you
thought would make you feel great?

01:08:27.674 --> 01:08:29.714
In a weird way,
you almost feel worse.

01:08:29.874 --> 01:08:32.554
Revenge, huh?
Some things hurt no matter what.

01:08:32.714 --> 01:08:34.714
That must be a fact
of life.

01:08:34.874 --> 01:08:38.314
- And what youre thinkin´
- Hi!

01:08:38.475 --> 01:08:41.194
Hi! Nick.

01:08:41.354 --> 01:08:44.435
I cant believe it.
What are you doin´ here?

01:08:44.595 --> 01:08:47.635
- Danielle.
- Oops.

01:08:47.796 --> 01:08:50.156
I dont know
what I´mm doin´ here.

01:08:50.316 --> 01:08:53.036
- What are you doin here?
- Well, Sheila, my best friend-

01:08:53.197 --> 01:08:56.836
Well, she used to be my best friend. I guess,
technically, Marcy would be my best friend.

01:08:56.997 --> 01:08:59.636
I mean, they both think theyre my
best friend, which is okay by me.

01:08:59.796 --> 01:09:02.917
But once I did have this nightmare
where Sheila and Marcy are sitting...

01:09:03.078 --> 01:09:05.837
right next to each other, and this
Eskimo guy comes over and says, ´PPick. ´´´

01:09:05.997 --> 01:09:10.198
I thought I was gonna die. I mean,
an Eskimo guy. What is that all about?

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.598
Anyway, Sheila, shes visiting
and she´ss staying here.

01:09:12.758 --> 01:09:14.917
And so I thought Id take her
to a party and show her a good time.

01:09:15.078 --> 01:09:19.359
And she meets this guy and goes home
with him instead. And, oh, well.

01:09:19.519 --> 01:09:22.238
You really look good.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.160
You look-
You look good too.

01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:28.481
- Thank you.
- Do you want a drink?

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.081
Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure.

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:36.720
You know, Im such a klutz. I spilled
beer all over my dress earlier.

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:41.482
And, well, I think its stained.
Did it stain, Nick?

01:09:51.162 --> 01:09:54.923
I have Sheilas room key.
You wanna come up?

01:09:55.084 --> 01:09:57.524
- Lets get hot
- Oh, yes, it´ss ladies´ night

01:09:57.684 --> 01:09:59.844
And the vibes is right

01:10:00.004 --> 01:10:02.244
Oh, yes, its ladies´ night
Oh, what a night

01:10:02.404 --> 01:10:04.364
Oh, what a night

01:10:04.524 --> 01:10:08.485
Its ladies´ night
and the feeling´ss right

01:10:08.645 --> 01:10:11.365
Oh, yes, its ladies´ night
Oh, what a night

01:10:11.525 --> 01:10:13.445
Oh, what a night

01:10:23.006 --> 01:10:25.326
Nick, Nick,
use your key, man.

01:10:27.886 --> 01:10:29.647
All right.
All right, Nick. Damn!

01:10:31.487 --> 01:10:35.408
- Hey, Nick, why couldnt you just use your key?
- Turn your bed down?

01:10:49.769 --> 01:10:52.049
Stay.

01:11:10.731 --> 01:11:12.772
The lady is lookin good

01:11:12.932 --> 01:11:16.812
- Just like the lady should
- Just like the lady should

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:20.732
Ive been thinking about this
for so long. I want you so bad.

01:11:20.893 --> 01:11:22.853
I just wanted to
make her happy.

01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:25.614
This is gonna be a night
that you wont forget.

01:11:25.773 --> 01:11:27.573
I try to forget,
but I cant.

01:11:27.733 --> 01:11:31.894
- Give it to me, Nick.
- Give. Thats all I did was give.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:45.216
Nick? Nick, youre really putting
a damper on the mood here.

01:11:45.376 --> 01:11:47.376
Im sorry.
I don´tt know.

01:11:47.536 --> 01:11:50.576
Danielle, I cant.
I just can´tt.

01:11:52.216 --> 01:11:55.217
I just wanna make you mine

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:58.337
Well be together
till the end of time

01:11:58.497 --> 01:12:01.617
Hey, Kareem. Are you aware
that Charlie and I...

01:12:01.777 --> 01:12:05.017
had intended to come up here
and cap your punk ass?

01:12:05.177 --> 01:12:07.018
And your girlfriend Nick.

01:12:07.178 --> 01:12:10.418
But, shit, you two muffins did such an
outstanding job with this financing...

01:12:10.578 --> 01:12:13.658
I mean, who could think about killing
at a time like this?

01:12:13.818 --> 01:12:17.179
Thanks. Your approval
means a lot.

01:12:17.339 --> 01:12:21.379
- Did I tell you to speak? Did I tell you to speak?
- Charlie, no.

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:24.740
Thats gonna be too loud.

01:12:24.899 --> 01:12:26.980
Too loud.

01:12:55.864 --> 01:12:59.864
- Hello? Hello?
- Hi.

01:13:00.023 --> 01:13:03.425
Oh, my God!
Nick, is that you? Are you okay?

01:13:04.824 --> 01:13:07.785
- Im fine.
- Oh, thank God!

01:13:07.945 --> 01:13:09.945
I didnt know if, if you-

01:13:10.105 --> 01:13:13.785
I thought that-
Youre not hurt?

01:13:13.945 --> 01:13:18.545
- No.
- Oh, thank God! Where are you?

01:13:18.706 --> 01:13:23.946
Look, Ann, lets not make this harder
than it has to be. I saw you.

01:13:24.107 --> 01:13:28.227
- What?
- I saw you. I know.

01:13:28.387 --> 01:13:30.627
Saw me what?
What are you talking about?

01:13:30.787 --> 01:13:33.468
Come on. Do you have to do this?
You and Phillip.

01:13:33.627 --> 01:13:35.988
- What about him?
- Youre denying it. She´ss denying it.

01:13:36.148 --> 01:13:40.828
I dont believe this.
Friday afternoon. Remember?

01:13:40.989 --> 01:13:45.669
Well, guess what.
I came home early. I saw you, Ann.

01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:51.229
- I was there.
- Oh. Oh, no.

01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:53.870
Yeah. Oh, no.

01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:58.831
Nick, I was still
at work Friday afternoon.

01:13:58.991 --> 01:14:04.031
At work? Well, then your-your clone
was at home screwing my boss.

01:14:04.191 --> 01:14:07.871
Nick, it was my sister.
Remember, I told you...

01:14:08.032 --> 01:14:10.592
she was coming next Friday
with her fiance?

01:14:10.752 --> 01:14:14.152
Well, I made a mistake. It was this
Friday. They called from the airport.

01:14:14.312 --> 01:14:15.952
I told them about
the key in the planter.

01:14:16.112 --> 01:14:17.992
I called you, but youd
already left the office.

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:20.513
So I left you a message
on the machine at home.

01:14:20.673 --> 01:14:24.473
What about
- What about the cuff links? Phillips cuff links were on the sink, Ann.

01:14:24.634 --> 01:14:27.114
Honey, theyve been in the dresser
since the Christmas party.

01:14:27.273 --> 01:14:31.074
I left them on the counter so youd
finally remember to bring them to him.

01:14:31.234 --> 01:14:33.794
So youre not having
an affair?

01:14:33.914 --> 01:14:37.554
- No, you dick!
- You still love me?

01:14:37.714 --> 01:14:39.875
More than anything in the world.

01:14:40.035 --> 01:14:44.315
You- You wouldnt believe
what I´vve been through.

01:14:44.475 --> 01:14:49.236
Youre gonna laugh,
but I actually- Shit.

01:14:49.396 --> 01:14:52.197
- Whats the matter? What´ss wrong?
- Shit!

01:14:52.357 --> 01:14:55.396
- Whats the matter? What?
- Shit!

01:14:55.556 --> 01:14:57.397
Shit! Shit!

01:14:57.557 --> 01:14:59.517
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit...

01:14:59.677 --> 01:15:01.997
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit.

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:09.359
Going down.

01:15:18.479 --> 01:15:21.039
- Dont touch it.
- Oh, man.

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.000
Oh, man.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.721
I think I can open the door
and catch the sheet.

01:15:32.881 --> 01:15:35.761
- Dont touch the sheet, please. Don´tt-
- No, no, no.

01:15:35.921 --> 01:15:38.761
- No, dont move. Don´tt move.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I done moved the hand.

01:15:38.921 --> 01:15:42.322
I really dont think you should be moving right now. I
- I think you´rre moving.

01:15:42.482 --> 01:15:44.882
- Call the paramedics. Listen to me.
- All right.

01:15:45.042 --> 01:15:48.202
Get them here

01:15:48.362 --> 01:15:50.483
Have them meet me
with a gurney.

01:15:50.643 --> 01:15:53.203
- Wait. Let me practise.
- Let you practise?

01:15:53.323 --> 01:15:56.883

01:15:57.044 --> 01:15:59.723

What do you mean, you dont know?
I thought you said you had a plan.

01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:43.936
- That was my plan: to ram them.
- Ram them.

01:17:45.095 --> 01:17:46.656

You and your prom date

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:02.664
That way I dont have to kill
an unarmed couple. It´ss not my style.

01:19:02.824 --> 01:19:04.984
Put down the bag.

01:19:06.505 --> 01:19:09.705
- Paul Bunyan, come and take the bag.

01:19:09.865 --> 01:19:12.065
- Youre an idiot! Shut up! - Shoot this

01:19:12.225 --> 01:19:16.626
Who are you? Crime dog now? Are you aware that

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:19.346
There are killers,
and then theres everybody else.

01:19:19.466 --> 01:19:24.067
Im a killer, Nick. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Oh, you son of a-
Wait, wait, wait.

01:19:48.429 --> 01:19:52.109
Huh? Whos in control now?

01:19:52.269 --> 01:19:54.510
Hand over the bag...

01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:58.631

01:19:58.791 --> 01:20:00.591

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:09.151

01:20:09.312 --> 01:20:11.991
Let me try to get around

01:20:12.152 --> 01:20:13.792
No, its not-

01:20:15.793 --> 01:20:18.433
- No, theyre in the alley. -
Charlie, it´ss the police. - Oh, yes!

01:20:18.592 --> 01:20:23.153
- Thank God youre here. - Thank God you´rre

01:20:23.313 --> 01:20:25.633
- What the fuck are you doin?

01:20:25.794 --> 01:20:28.154
Put that gun down,

01:20:28.313 --> 01:20:30.674
- Wait! Come on!
- Come on, man!

01:20:34.074 --> 01:20:36.714

01:20:36.875 --> 01:20:41.035
Well, some folks in Arizona are
gonna be mighty happy to see you boys.

01:20:42.676 --> 01:20:46.035
Wait, wait, wait! Officer! Officer!
Officer, two other guys-

01:20:49.036 --> 01:20:53.677
´II´mm married. ´´´ Ka-blam!
You´rre too much.

01:20:53.836 --> 01:20:55.597
- Is the money all there?
- Looks like it.

01:20:55.756 --> 01:21:00.317
Great. We have just enough time
to get it back.

01:21:00.477 --> 01:21:02.477
Excuse me?

01:21:02.637 --> 01:21:05.678
We have to bring the money back.

01:21:05.838 --> 01:21:07.438
No, no.

01:21:07.598 --> 01:21:10.758
Maybe youre a little bit confused
about the purpose of a robbery.

01:21:10.919 --> 01:21:13.998
Oh, T., I didnt tell you. When we
were at the hotel, I called my wife.

01:21:14.159 --> 01:21:16.399
Everythings all right.
You see, it wasn´tt her.

01:21:16.559 --> 01:21:19.679
She wasnt even there.
Isn´tt that great?

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:24.000
It was her sister
and her sisters fiance.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.760
I dont give a damn if it was
her Uncle Fester and Gumby.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.480
You aint takin´
this money anywhere, man.

01:21:31.601 --> 01:21:33.601
I dont wanna
hear all that.

01:21:38.001 --> 01:21:40.042
- Let go. Let go.
- Gimme the bag. You let go.

01:21:40.201 --> 01:21:41.841
- Let go of the bag. You let-
- Its not your money.

01:21:42.002 --> 01:21:43.362
- Its not your money.
- It´ss not your money!

01:21:43.522 --> 01:21:45.123
- Its not yours. It´ss half mine.
- Let go!

01:21:45.282 --> 01:21:46.802
- You let go! - Let

01:21:46.962 --> 01:21:48.803
Let go!

01:21:56.604 --> 01:21:58.723
Get back here!

01:22:17.645 --> 01:22:20.446
- You okay?
- Yeah, Im okay.

01:22:20.606 --> 01:22:23.767
- And you?
- Ill live.

01:22:26.566 --> 01:22:29.127
Cant let you take
the money, Nick.

01:22:29.247 --> 01:22:31.927
T., my life is in that bag.

01:22:32.087 --> 01:22:37.128
Nick, even if you wanted
to take the money back, you cant.

01:22:37.288 --> 01:22:41.128
- Your face is on the video, man.
- They only review the tapes if somethings missing.

01:22:41.288 --> 01:22:44.569
I can go into work early
and bring it back. No onell know.

01:22:48.569 --> 01:22:50.329
T.

01:22:54.650 --> 01:22:56.570
I can get my life back.

01:23:11.092 --> 01:23:16.092
You forget one thing, Nick.
I get my life back too.

01:23:48.776 --> 01:23:51.457
Money dont make
my world go ´rround

01:23:53.536 --> 01:23:56.416
Im reaching out
for the higher ground

01:23:58.657 --> 01:24:02.418
To a warm and peaceful place

01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:07.138
I can rest my weary face

01:24:08.698 --> 01:24:10.858
Lifes answers we try to find

01:24:11.018 --> 01:24:13.578
Oh, we try to find
Yes, we try to find

01:24:13.739 --> 01:24:17.019
Battling inside our minds

01:24:18.579 --> 01:24:23.420
Where do I go from here

01:24:23.579 --> 01:24:27.900
Will all my friends be there

01:24:28.061 --> 01:24:30.941
Cause we´rre living
we´rre living

01:24:31.101 --> 01:24:33.101
In a crazy maze

01:24:33.261 --> 01:24:36.022
And were fighting
we´rre fighting

01:24:36.182 --> 01:24:37.501
To rise above the haze

01:24:37.662 --> 01:24:40.741
Lights at the end
of the tunnel

01:24:40.902 --> 01:24:43.502
Sometimes the journeys long

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:46.023
There are many theories

01:24:46.183 --> 01:24:49.343
Whos right and who´ss wrong

01:24:51.023 --> 01:24:54.503
Pressures on
I have to choose

01:24:56.223 --> 01:24:59.264
Ive got nothing to lose

01:25:01.064 --> 01:25:04.864
I close my eyes
I take a chance

01:25:05.024 --> 01:25:09.225
I- I, I now dance
a different dance

01:25:11.265 --> 01:25:13.346
Whats the key
to a happy life

01:25:13.505 --> 01:25:15.946
Tell me now, now, now

01:25:16.106 --> 01:25:19.026
Healthy mind
and lots of spice

01:25:21.226 --> 01:25:24.547
Running barefoot
through the trees

01:25:24.707 --> 01:25:27.827
- Oh, my God!
- Thats my idea of free

01:25:27.987 --> 01:25:30.547
Ow. Ouch.

01:25:30.707 --> 01:25:33.267
What happened to you?

01:25:33.388 --> 01:25:35.668
Its a long story.

01:25:35.828 --> 01:25:38.068
- I got shot.
- What?

01:25:38.228 --> 01:25:40.789
And I- I think
Im wanted in Arizona.

01:25:41.989 --> 01:25:44.989
Plus, my shoes
caught on fire.

01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:52.790
You told me you were selling me the top of
the line. The top of the line is digital.

01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:55.310
Did you sell me a digital?
No, you did not.

01:25:55.471 --> 01:25:57.310
So, Im bringing it back,
and I expect a full refund.

01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:59.311
And if you do not give me
a full refund, you will not...

01:25:59.470 --> 01:26:01.631
be doing business
with myself or my company.

01:26:01.791 --> 01:26:03.591
Thank you.

01:26:05.511 --> 01:26:09.631
- So, did you hear?
- What?

01:26:09.792 --> 01:26:12.192
Some, uh, vandals
broke in over the weekend.

01:26:12.352 --> 01:26:16.313
- What? - Well, nothing was
stolen. They- They cut the-

01:26:16.472 --> 01:26:18.513
the thingy...

01:26:18.672 --> 01:26:22.033
off P.B.s statue.

01:26:24.794 --> 01:26:28.153
Um, theyre reviewing
the videotape.

01:26:35.195 --> 01:26:37.955
- Hi, everybody. Hows it going?
- Not now, Nick.

01:26:40.355 --> 01:26:42.995
- Did anybody see that game last night?
- Game? What game?

01:26:43.155 --> 01:26:46.036
- Oh, that game. Overtime.
- Will you please shut up!

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:52.957
Dont touch it. Don´tt touch it.
Oh, you pig. Oh, you pig.

01:26:58.757 --> 01:27:00.638
Well, thats it.
What´ss done is done. Listen.

01:27:00.797 --> 01:27:02.638
Ive got this great idea for
the new McGinty Cracker mascot.

01:27:02.798 --> 01:27:04.878
- Move! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Thank you. - This mascot-

01:27:05.037 --> 01:27:07.318
- This-
- Nick! Shut up!

01:27:12.799 --> 01:27:15.359
Whats happening?

01:27:17.399 --> 01:27:20.640
Well, what is this?
What the hell is this?

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.600
- I dont know.
- You goin´ crazy as a spider!

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.000
Somebody mustve recorded
over the tape.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:31.481
- Who had access?
- Uh, there was an electrician in here this morning.

01:27:31.641 --> 01:27:34.041
What electrician?
I did not order an electrician!

01:27:34.201 --> 01:27:38.602
I did. The flickers on the-
Fluorescent lights were flickering.

01:27:38.762 --> 01:27:41.082
- Im really sorry, sir.
- This is terrible, Phil.

01:27:41.242 --> 01:27:42.762
- I would really like to be alone
now. - Ill go now. - You should go.

01:27:42.922 --> 01:27:45.002
- I would be really like to be alone. - You
should go. - Ill leave now. - You should go too.

01:27:45.162 --> 01:27:47.842
- I would like to be extremely alone for a minute.
- Im gonna leave you alone.

01:27:48.002 --> 01:27:50.763
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Nick.

01:27:55.963 --> 01:27:57.843
All right now. Cut that out.
Yall wanna eat? You wanna eat?

01:27:58.003 --> 01:28:00.004
- Yeah, we wanna eat.
- I thought you wanna eat. You wanna eat? All right.

01:28:00.164 --> 01:28:02.324
- Just dont burn the meat.
- I don´tt never burn the meat.

01:28:02.485 --> 01:28:05.245
- Uh-huh. What happened the last time?
- Hey, Dad dont burn the meat.

01:28:05.404 --> 01:28:08.405
- Im gonna put some more po-po sauce
on it. Y´aall like that. - Joey. Tonya.

01:28:08.565 --> 01:28:12.045
- Yeah, thats-
- Go see your mama, boy. You know.

01:28:12.206 --> 01:28:15.005
Now this is my very
special mustard.

01:28:15.165 --> 01:28:17.406
- Dont let nobody touch that.
- Okay, Mama.

01:28:17.566 --> 01:28:20.126
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:28:20.286 --> 01:28:22.767
So, hows the
electrician business?

01:28:24.206 --> 01:28:28.527
Hey. Not bad.
The hours are a bitch.

01:28:29.648 --> 01:28:31.487
I wanna thank you.

01:28:31.647 --> 01:28:36.168
I dont know why- I just wanna say
I appreciate what you did.

01:28:38.128 --> 01:28:41.409
Well, dont mention it. How´ss that?
How did you know where I was anyway?

01:28:43.289 --> 01:28:45.089
A friend gave me a tip.

01:28:46.849 --> 01:28:49.209
A friend, huh?

01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:52.130
- You hungry?
- Yes, we would love for you to join us.

01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:54.290
Wouldnt we, Mama?

01:28:58.051 --> 01:29:00.731
I talked to my boss today
after things settled down.

01:29:00.891 --> 01:29:05.251
Convinced him we need
a new security system. Got any ideas?

01:29:05.411 --> 01:29:07.811
Sure. I can help you
pick one out.

01:29:07.971 --> 01:29:11.172
You wanna run it?
We need someone trustworthy.

01:29:11.332 --> 01:29:13.973
I told him I know
just the guy.

01:29:14.132 --> 01:29:15.812
Well, Im gonna have to
think about this, Nick.

01:29:15.973 --> 01:29:20.093
Right now, Im weighing out several
lucrative offers. I mean, they rollin´ in.

01:29:20.253 --> 01:29:22.533
A lot of people want me
to work for them right now.

01:29:22.693 --> 01:29:25.774
Now, thats just
the way I like it.

01:29:25.933 --> 01:29:29.014
All I need now is some
of Mamas special mustard.

01:29:29.174 --> 01:29:30.975
Stop.

01:29:37.415 --> 01:29:39.975
Whatd I do?

01:29:50.536 --> 01:29:54.257
- Run, run!
- Stay down, Nick. Get on outta here.

01:29:54.417 --> 01:29:57.458
Ill beat you into the-

01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:02.218
See you when you get there

01:30:12.939 --> 01:30:16.299
Now I seen places and faces of things
you aint never thought about thinkin´

01:30:16.459 --> 01:30:18.860
If you aint peeked then you
must be drinkin´ and smokin´

01:30:19.019 --> 01:30:22.340
Pretendin that you´rre locin´
but you´rre broken, let me get you open

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:25.220
Now, little Timmy got his diploma
and little Jimmy got life

01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:28.021
And Tamica around the corner
just took her first hit off the pipe

01:30:28.181 --> 01:30:30.741
The other homey shot the other homey
and ran off with his money

01:30:30.861 --> 01:30:33.341
And when the other homeys heard about it
they thought that it was funny

01:30:33.501 --> 01:30:35.821
But whos the dummy ´ccause now
you done lost a hustler

01:30:35.982 --> 01:30:38.262
A down-ass brother
done replaced by a bustler

01:30:38.422 --> 01:30:40.622
And though I got love for ya
I know I cant trust ya

01:30:40.782 --> 01:30:43.342
Cause my crew is rollin´ numbers
and your crew is rollin´ dusters

01:30:43.502 --> 01:30:46.222
And just because of that you act
like you dont like a brother no more

01:30:46.383 --> 01:30:48.502
I guess thats just
the way you go

01:30:48.663 --> 01:30:52.263
I aint tryin´ to preach, I believe
I can reach but your mind ain´tt prepared

01:30:52.423 --> 01:30:54.183
I see ya when you get there

01:30:54.344 --> 01:30:57.823
Ill see you
when you get there

01:30:57.984 --> 01:31:00.624
If you ever get there

01:31:00.784 --> 01:31:03.705
See you when you get there

01:31:03.864 --> 01:31:08.265
Ill see you
when you get there

01:31:08.425 --> 01:31:10.706
If you ever get there

01:31:10.865 --> 01:31:13.866
See you when you get there

01:31:14.025 --> 01:31:16.186
More temptation and fate
I guess we livin for today

01:31:16.345 --> 01:31:19.026
I seen a man get swept off his feet
by a bull with an AK

01:31:19.186 --> 01:31:21.426
The situations so twisted
everybody gettin´ lifted

01:31:21.586 --> 01:31:24.306
Im just tryin´ to take care
of my kids and handle my business

01:31:24.467 --> 01:31:26.787
Cause it´ss way too serious
so you gotta pay close attention

01:31:26.947 --> 01:31:29.348
So you dont get caught slippin´
when they come to do all the gettin´

01:31:29.508 --> 01:31:31.668
Life is a big game so you gotta
play it with the big boys

01:31:31.828 --> 01:31:34.228
Some of us gotta run a little faster
cause we gotta lay the straw

01:31:34.388 --> 01:31:37.108
But Id be a fool to surrender
when I know I can be a contender

01:31:37.268 --> 01:31:39.629
If everybodys ascended
then everybody can be a winner

01:31:39.789 --> 01:31:41.909
No matter your rag color
Deep down we all brothers

01:31:42.069 --> 01:31:44.549
And we gonna set a time
Somebody up there still love us

01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:47.190
Im gonna scuffle and struggle with ya
I´mm breathless and weak

01:31:47.349 --> 01:31:49.790
I done strived my whole life
to make it to the mountain peak

01:31:49.949 --> 01:31:52.270
Always keep reachin
Sure to grab onto somethin´

01:31:52.429 --> 01:31:55.270
Ill be there when you get there
waitin´ with the sounds bumpin´

01:31:55.431 --> 01:31:59.590
Ill see you
when you get there

01:31:59.751 --> 01:32:01.871
If you ever get there

01:32:02.031 --> 01:32:05.111
See you when you get there

01:32:05.272 --> 01:32:09.711
Ill see you
when you get there

01:32:09.872 --> 01:32:12.232
If you ever get there

01:32:12.392 --> 01:32:15.433
See you when
you get there

01:32:15.593 --> 01:32:18.513
As we walk down the road
of our destiny

01:32:18.673 --> 01:32:21.233
And the time comes to choose
which shall it be

01:32:21.354 --> 01:32:23.233
The wide and crooked
or the straight and narrow

01:32:23.394 --> 01:32:26.193
We got one voice to give
and one life to live

01:32:26.354 --> 01:32:28.994
Stand up for somethin
or lay down in the game

01:32:29.154 --> 01:32:31.434
Listen to the song
that we sing

01:32:31.594 --> 01:32:33.434
Its up to you
to make your beef

01:32:33.594 --> 01:32:36.155
I guess Ill see you
when you see me

01:32:36.315 --> 01:32:40.156
Ill see you

01:32:40.315 --> 01:32:43.075
When you get there

01:32:43.236 --> 01:32:46.036
If you wanna get there

01:32:46.195 --> 01:32:50.476

01:32:50.636 --> 01:32:53.677

Ill see you

01:33:10.999 --> 01:33:12.879
When you get there
