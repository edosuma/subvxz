00:05.823 --> 00:07.763
<i>Previously on "Berlin Station"...</i>

00:07.783 --> 00:10.654
<i>The CIA's go-to
wetworks man in Berlin</i>

00:10.674 --> 00:12.764
<i>from '83 up to the fall of the wall.</i>

00:12.784 --> 00:14.784
Those dates.
Diver would have been the one.

00:14.804 --> 00:16.694
<i>And then he just disappeared.</i>

00:16.714 --> 00:18.654
You think Diver
killed your mother?

00:18.674 --> 00:20.684
The years line up. Berlin would
have been his hunting ground.

00:20.704 --> 00:22.754
I just got
a night action from Estonia.

00:22.774 --> 00:24.654
Ethnic Russians and Free Estonians

00:24.674 --> 00:25.764
are at each other's throats.

00:25.784 --> 00:28.694
Daniel, Robert, I want you both
to go to Tallinn tomorrow.

00:28.714 --> 00:30.694
There's just one guy there...
named Torres.

00:33.804 --> 00:35.744
Damn.

00:35.764 --> 00:37.634
It's nice to see some friendlies.

00:37.654 --> 00:39.704
The Russians are already making a move.

00:39.724 --> 00:40.734
Saw a ghost.

00:40.754 --> 00:43.664
The guy's name is Sergei Basarov. Sniper.

00:43.684 --> 00:45.516
You need to listen to us, Henrik.

00:50.339 --> 00:52.674
Sofia Vesik. Meet my friends.

00:52.694 --> 00:54.714
Tell them about
your "Sama Kaart" program.

00:54.734 --> 00:55.714
Any friend of Henrik's...

00:55.734 --> 00:57.515
Can she be brought into our tent?

00:57.540 --> 00:59.630
If she's persuaded it's best for Estonia.

00:59.655 --> 01:01.595
Wait a minute. You all right?
You want to see that?

01:01.620 --> 01:03.396
Do you see that? Halos.

01:03.421 --> 01:05.611
Henrik Viiding passed
of cardiac arrest

01:05.636 --> 01:08.176
at exactly 18:39.

01:08.307 --> 01:09.664
That was way more
than just a heart attack.

01:09.684 --> 01:11.684
We need to get to the body
and get a sample.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.181
I need two
on the next train out of here.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.704
You're set.

01:17.684 --> 01:18.844
Where is it?

01:23.724 --> 01:25.694
- Who did that to you?
- He had training.

01:25.714 --> 01:26.794
He's definitely
been in the field.

01:26.814 --> 01:28.724
- Spetsnaz?
- Torres was right.

01:28.744 --> 01:30.694
There's something going on here.
Get this to Valerie.

01:30.714 --> 01:31.794
It went to shit, Valerie.

01:31.814 --> 01:33.784
Robert, where's Daniel?

01:33.804 --> 01:34.844
We got separated.

01:34.864 --> 01:36.814
I left him there. He's wounded.

02:53.744 --> 02:54.854
Mom?!

04:09.684 --> 04:11.834
Daniel. Are you safe?

04:11.854 --> 04:13.664
Did Robert make it back?

04:13.684 --> 04:15.754
Yeah, he got back about an hour ago.

04:15.774 --> 04:17.853
He said you're wounded.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.392
Daniel, I need to know,

04:20.416 --> 04:22.754
because if you pass out in
a ditch, you make my job harder.

04:22.774 --> 04:24.289
Do not make my job harder.

04:24.644 --> 04:28.704
Listen, I saw a strange train
this morning outside Tallinn.

04:28.724 --> 04:31.343
Headed west, stealth mode,

04:31.363 --> 04:33.296
blacked-out markings, packed full of men.

04:33.316 --> 04:34.674
What, soldiers?

04:34.694 --> 04:37.754
I don't know, but maybe the
Little Green Men Torres spotted.

04:37.774 --> 04:40.644
The guy who jumped me
was Spetsnaz, that's for sure.

04:40.664 --> 04:43.252
Robert said that you were trying
to locate Sofia Vesik.

04:43.272 --> 04:44.346
Did you reach her?

04:44.371 --> 04:46.187
Uh, not yet, but I'll find her.

04:46.207 --> 04:47.754
Daniel, you don't have to do this.

04:47.774 --> 04:48.754
Torres is there.

04:48.774 --> 04:49.804
Yeah, well, so am I.

04:49.824 --> 04:52.844
If it is Russia,
then we need proof and fast

04:53.318 --> 04:55.684
before their troops are in place.

04:55.704 --> 04:57.644
We'll send you Sofia's address.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.124
- You get the proof.
- Okay.

04:59.144 --> 05:01.734
But you get yourself patched up.
You hear me?

05:59.674 --> 06:00.654
Kirsch.

06:00.674 --> 06:02.220
SCIF in 20.

06:02.774 --> 06:03.834
Okay.

06:19.854 --> 06:22.256
You don't really think someone was
trying to break into your apartment.

06:22.281 --> 06:23.610
Yeah, of course I do.

06:23.644 --> 06:24.834
What, trying to get the hair sample?

06:24.854 --> 06:27.724
Which I had already dropped off
at the lab.

06:27.744 --> 06:30.824
Had to wake Krakauer up, but
fuck it, do your job, asshole.

06:30.844 --> 06:33.413
- You look nice.
- You look like shit.

06:33.433 --> 06:34.784
- Thanks.
- You get any sleep?

06:34.804 --> 06:37.644
It was a rough night. Fuck sleep.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.834
You guys? SCIF.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.654
Officer Torres, thank you
so much for joining us.

06:45.674 --> 06:48.734
Since Tallinn Station is dark,
we'll be taking point from here.

06:48.754 --> 06:50.258
<i>Copy that.</i>

06:50.278 --> 06:53.238
Now, we should be expecting
the tox results

06:53.258 --> 06:55.064
from the hair samples within a few hours.

06:55.644 --> 06:56.824
You know, there was a waitress
at the café.

06:56.844 --> 06:58.714
He ate that every day.

06:58.734 --> 07:00.794
What the fuck was her name?

07:00.814 --> 07:03.714
Maret. She might know something.

07:03.734 --> 07:06.724
<i>Maybe she poisoned him.
I'll go have a word.</i>

07:06.744 --> 07:08.804
Well, for a change,
maybe try not to torture her.

07:08.824 --> 07:10.521
<i>Mm, I miss you, man.</i>

07:10.541 --> 07:12.107
<i>I looked up, and you were gone.</i>

07:12.127 --> 07:15.664
Daniel reported that he saw
a train full of men

07:15.684 --> 07:17.704
on a defunct line, no markings.

07:17.724 --> 07:20.634
<i>No uniforms, no fingerprints, either.</i>

07:20.654 --> 07:22.754
<i>Tallinn's infested with Spetsnaz.</i>

07:22.774 --> 07:25.714
<i>The sniper I made, Sergei Basarov,</i>

07:25.734 --> 07:27.448
<i>and the guy who attacked Miller.</i>

07:27.468 --> 07:31.392
So Russian forces attacked a CIA
officer outside of a war zone,

07:31.417 --> 07:33.714
or are we now classifying
Estonia as a war zone?

07:33.734 --> 07:37.634
No, no one's calling this a war,
least of all the Russians.

07:37.654 --> 07:41.194
This is just an internal
ethnic conflict in Estonia.

07:41.425 --> 07:44.774
Uh, that's how
the Crimean Playbook starts.

07:44.794 --> 07:47.804
Take out the moderate voices,
the peacemakers,

07:47.824 --> 07:51.078
douse with gasoline, strike a match.

07:51.694 --> 07:53.764
We're gonna need help, though.

07:53.784 --> 07:57.587
Henrik said that Sofia Vesik
had national pull.

07:57.634 --> 07:58.764
Is that... Is that true?

07:58.784 --> 08:00.804
I sent Daniel her address.

08:00.824 --> 08:03.654
Smart, telegenic,

08:03.674 --> 08:07.255
uh, more Twitter followers than Beyoncé.

08:07.275 --> 08:08.794
Today is the release of Sama Kaart,

08:08.814 --> 08:10.664
her white passport program.

08:10.684 --> 08:12.318
Ethnic Russians, a third of the country,

08:12.338 --> 08:14.684
have had gray passports
since the Soviets left.

08:14.704 --> 08:17.764
It's less rights, second-class citizens.

08:17.784 --> 08:20.376
Sofia's white passport unites all sides.

08:20.396 --> 08:21.834
Yeah, that explains "why now."

08:21.854 --> 08:25.724
You can't manipulate an
angry mob if they're not angry.

08:25.744 --> 08:28.694
This could be Russia's
last chance to take Estonia,

08:28.714 --> 08:32.734
and if Estonia goes,
so do the other Baltics,

08:32.754 --> 08:34.804
then it's on to Poland.

08:34.823 --> 08:36.734
Iron Curtain falls again.

08:51.084 --> 08:53.694
- _
- Can I speak to Sofia Vesik?

08:53.714 --> 08:55.734
<i>Ms. Vesik is busy.</i>

08:55.754 --> 08:57.714
<i>It's okay, Jan.</i>

08:57.734 --> 08:59.634
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

08:59.654 --> 09:02.024
We need to talk. Please.

09:02.714 --> 09:04.784
Remember, "Any friend of Henrik's."

09:04.804 --> 09:06.684
<i>Henrik's dead.</i>

09:09.654 --> 09:11.242
My name is Daniel Miller.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.814
You're just gonna have to trust me.

09:33.744 --> 09:35.844
You're lucky you have
a trustworthy voice.

09:46.814 --> 09:48.784
Jesus! What happened?

09:48.804 --> 09:51.153
Okay. Let me call an ambulance.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.744
No, no, don't call anyone, please.

09:55.684 --> 09:57.674
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I just need to clean up.

10:08.694 --> 10:09.784
Yeah?

10:11.664 --> 10:12.744
Here's the T-shirt.

10:12.764 --> 10:13.824
You got a needle and thread?

10:13.844 --> 10:15.804
No, I have a tailor.

10:17.218 --> 10:18.976
Oh, my God.

10:19.734 --> 10:20.824
Come with me.

10:22.644 --> 10:23.634
This is crazy.

10:23.654 --> 10:25.704
You should have gone to a doctor.

10:25.724 --> 10:28.027
What is that? Is that superglue?

10:28.445 --> 10:30.644
It's called transglutaminase.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.324
- Hm.
- It's a culinary adhesive.

10:33.704 --> 10:35.844
My ex, Maksim, he was a chef.

10:35.864 --> 10:38.037
Trying to be.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.577
Wait, so it's meat glue?

10:40.602 --> 10:42.161
I wasn't going to call it that,

10:42.186 --> 10:44.667
but you went there,
so, yes, it's meat glue.

10:44.692 --> 10:45.772
Okay.

10:45.844 --> 10:48.664
Let's give it some time to set.

10:50.341 --> 10:52.694
I'm guessing you weren't mugged.

10:56.644 --> 10:58.684
Who are you, Mr. Miller?

11:01.744 --> 11:03.413
I work for the American government.

11:03.433 --> 11:04.794
Ah.

11:04.814 --> 11:07.764
We were consulting Henrik,

11:07.784 --> 11:10.784
hoping he might smooth over some
ruffled diplomatic feathers.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.363
Bullshit.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.634
They're saying it was a heart attack,

11:16.654 --> 11:18.494
but it doesn't feel right.

11:19.277 --> 11:20.794
Why is Henrik Viiding dead?

11:20.814 --> 11:22.804
Because he was fearless.

11:23.124 --> 11:24.804
He wanted peace.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.834
Sama Kaart will make that possible.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.694
My white passport program.

11:30.714 --> 11:32.607
Henrik convinced Parliament
to trust my tech.

11:32.634 --> 11:35.609
- Russia's not going to allow Sama Kaart.
- They have no fucking choice.

11:35.634 --> 11:37.724
No, they can't retake a united Estonia.

11:37.744 --> 11:39.634
I'm speaking at Centennial
tonight on Henrik's behalf.

11:39.654 --> 11:41.079
You need to stay away
from the Centennial.

11:41.099 --> 11:43.299
Do you know how many
death threats I get every day?

11:43.319 --> 11:45.714
Trust me, these guys
will not give you a heads-up.

11:45.734 --> 11:47.744
I'm speaking for Henrik.
He deserves that.

11:47.764 --> 11:48.744
Okay.

11:48.764 --> 11:50.774
And I need to get to the office.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.694
Can we talk in the car?

11:53.764 --> 11:56.115
You're certainly persistent.

12:27.724 --> 12:29.744
- Hey, there.
- Hello.

12:29.764 --> 12:32.634
Um, is Maret working today?

12:32.654 --> 12:34.764
She helped me last week,
and she was awesome.

12:34.784 --> 12:37.072
Uh, not today, sorry.

12:37.092 --> 12:38.694
What can I do for you?

12:38.714 --> 12:40.734
Ah, nothing. I'm good.

12:40.754 --> 12:41.784
Yeah.

14:14.714 --> 14:16.814
Basically, Tervik
just uses new technology

14:16.834 --> 14:18.804
to make existing systems work better,

14:18.824 --> 14:22.794
like automation, robotics, I.T., telecom.

14:22.814 --> 14:24.764
Any chance you could
help me track a train

14:24.784 --> 14:26.223
no one's supposed to see?

14:27.510 --> 14:28.560
Maybe.

14:29.143 --> 14:31.020
You're a spy.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.804
Aren't you?

14:37.634 --> 14:39.784
Paavo. He keeps the servers singing.

14:44.097 --> 14:45.754
You met Jan.

14:47.724 --> 14:48.996
So, can you help me?

14:49.644 --> 14:51.834
If your train was really there,
Kaarta will find it.

14:51.854 --> 14:53.784
It's cutting-edge geomapping.

14:53.804 --> 14:57.714
Taps into satellites, Google Earth, CCTV,

14:57.734 --> 15:01.664
anything we can find to create
a real-time video feed.

15:01.684 --> 15:03.724
I guess you guys
never heard of the Patriot Act.

15:03.744 --> 15:06.744
I guess we're all
just hackers at heart.

15:06.764 --> 15:07.864
Mm-hmm.

15:08.644 --> 15:10.694
Okay. Where and when?

15:10.714 --> 15:15.824
Uh, about a kilometer north
of Balti Jaam, around 4:30 a.m.

15:19.864 --> 15:21.674
Hmm.

15:22.774 --> 15:24.854
I don't see any train tracks.

15:25.064 --> 15:26.694
You're not meant to.

15:31.714 --> 15:33.804
Okay, so GPS coordinates go here.

15:33.824 --> 15:36.252
- Mm-hmm.
- Any questions, ask Jan.

15:36.272 --> 15:37.674
Thanks.

16:30.744 --> 16:32.774
Um, Maret Yankova?

16:32.794 --> 16:34.810
Did I say that right?

16:35.704 --> 16:36.764
Yes.

16:36.784 --> 16:38.724
Really sorry to bother you.

16:38.744 --> 16:42.684
My name is Rafael Ramirez,
Associated Press.

16:45.154 --> 16:46.654
Uh...

16:47.864 --> 16:50.804
Totally, totally get it, ma'am.

16:50.824 --> 16:52.994
Who am I? Dogging you at home.

16:53.014 --> 16:54.744
It's just rude.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.774
It's not you. My babushka is ill.

16:56.794 --> 16:57.864
Two minutes tops.

16:58.045 --> 17:01.734
Just need some quotes for a
tribute piece on Henrik Viiding.

17:02.129 --> 17:05.799
Just want to know what he meant
to regular people like yourself.

17:06.473 --> 17:08.643
I heard you were his favorite waitress.

17:09.053 --> 17:10.743
Did I get that right?

17:14.694 --> 17:16.769
I liked Henrik very much.

17:18.145 --> 17:19.784
He was always kind to me.

17:19.804 --> 17:24.864
Some at the café were a bit,
how do you say...

17:25.470 --> 17:26.609
star-struck.

17:26.635 --> 17:27.685
Hmm.

17:28.467 --> 17:30.547
But he always put me at ease.

17:33.784 --> 17:35.774
That's what I've heard.

17:38.764 --> 17:42.664
Did you notice any signs
of failing health?

17:42.684 --> 17:44.634
He had spells.

17:45.214 --> 17:46.784
Maybe the flu?

17:48.744 --> 17:50.724
And he never ate well.

17:50.744 --> 17:52.644
Hmm.

17:54.734 --> 17:56.694
Baba needs me.

17:56.714 --> 17:57.754
Are we done?

17:58.185 --> 17:59.704
Yep.

17:59.724 --> 18:00.814
Thanks for your time.

18:44.634 --> 18:46.834
Are you sure about these tracks?

18:46.854 --> 18:48.834
<i>They exist. I've seen them.</i>

18:48.854 --> 18:51.724
Yeah, well, they aren't...

18:51.744 --> 18:52.814
Hold on.

18:59.997 --> 19:01.704
Found it!

19:01.724 --> 19:04.704
It looks like an old Soviet supply line.

19:04.724 --> 19:06.844
Runs from Kaliningrad in the west

19:06.864 --> 19:09.864
all the way through Estonia to Moscow.

19:10.644 --> 19:12.684
Looks like it hasn't been used
since the '70s.

19:12.704 --> 19:15.654
<i>Okay, see if you can find out
who's using them now.</i>

19:19.814 --> 19:21.804
<i>Robert's worried about you.</i>

19:21.824 --> 19:25.724
Well, Valerie, too,
but she hides it better.

19:25.744 --> 19:27.764
<i>Sofia patched me up.</i>

19:27.784 --> 19:29.734
All right, Sofia.

19:29.754 --> 19:31.320
What's she like?

19:31.694 --> 19:32.744
Rock star, right?

19:32.764 --> 19:34.844
Well, she didn't let me bleed to death.

19:37.674 --> 19:38.804
Wait.

19:38.824 --> 19:40.235
I don't get it.

19:40.255 --> 19:41.794
According to the time stamp,

19:41.814 --> 19:45.814
the train stopped for several
hours by a town called...

19:45.834 --> 19:47.002
Turba.

19:47.027 --> 19:48.082
Turba.

19:48.102 --> 19:49.764
Did they unload anything?

19:49.784 --> 19:52.674
<i>Nope. It's just sitting there.</i>

19:54.489 --> 19:55.794
You know what? I'm gonna check it out.

19:55.814 --> 19:57.203
<i>Well, as your handler,</i>

19:57.223 --> 19:59.684
<i>I recommend that you wait
until you have backup.</i>

19:59.704 --> 20:01.098
I'll be less conspicuous alone.

20:01.118 --> 20:03.674
In small-town Estonia? Please.

20:03.694 --> 20:05.694
You'll stand out like a redneck
at a Rihanna concert.

20:05.714 --> 20:07.854
<i>Look, just send me the coordinates,</i>

20:08.440 --> 20:10.540
and I'll do some recon.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.704
Hey, Robert.

20:21.724 --> 20:22.724
Hey.

20:22.744 --> 20:25.165
Can you just show me his file, please?

20:25.644 --> 20:27.644
If no one else bumps on Torres,

20:27.664 --> 20:30.674
if it's just me being me, I'll let it go.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.704
No, I'm not showing you his file.

20:34.724 --> 20:36.794
Oh, come on, please. Don't do that.

20:36.814 --> 20:38.854
This isn't about who's in charge.

20:39.634 --> 20:41.694
You're only COS because I took the blame

20:41.714 --> 20:42.844
when it all went FUBAR.

20:43.725 --> 20:45.694
You're right, Robert.

20:46.103 --> 20:50.704
They laid that all at your feet,
and it wasn't fair.

20:50.724 --> 20:54.734
And I came to you, and I asked
you how we could make it right,

20:54.754 --> 20:57.114
and you said Tokyo.

20:57.694 --> 21:01.034
And then I went to bat for you, didn't I?

21:01.734 --> 21:03.794
True, yeah, you did.

21:03.814 --> 21:06.540
What's wrong? You don't want
to go to Tokyo now?

21:07.340 --> 21:09.480
No, I-I do.

21:12.254 --> 21:13.844
I shouldn't have left Daniel.

21:15.804 --> 21:17.664
You made a call.

21:28.694 --> 21:30.189
Big day.

21:31.148 --> 21:33.609
I wish Henrik were here to see it.

21:34.684 --> 21:35.764
I need your promise

21:35.784 --> 21:37.774
that you won't go
to the Centennial tonight.

21:37.794 --> 21:39.078
Okay, if you're right,

21:39.098 --> 21:41.724
if Russia's really trying
to take back Estonia,

21:41.744 --> 21:43.994
what could we possibly do to stop them?

21:44.669 --> 21:47.764
If they're really coming, then...

21:47.784 --> 21:51.844
NATO will step in, and we'll go to war.

21:51.864 --> 21:53.744
But will you?

21:57.229 --> 21:58.724
Let's you and I keep the peace.

21:58.744 --> 22:00.385
Maybe we won't have to find out.

22:06.694 --> 22:09.704
Yeah, well, whatever
you got would be helpful.

22:09.724 --> 22:11.674
Seriously, I appreciate it.

22:11.694 --> 22:13.654
Okay, you ready?

22:14.844 --> 22:18.764
Torres, Rafael, with an "F."

22:18.784 --> 22:23.674
Social's 987-65-4329.

22:23.694 --> 22:26.203
I got... I got a lot of redactions.

22:26.744 --> 22:28.734
You got postings?

22:28.754 --> 22:30.764
Uh-huh.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.684
Afghanistan.

22:32.704 --> 22:33.854
Iraq.

22:34.253 --> 22:35.373
Yemen.

22:35.774 --> 22:37.255
Syria.

22:37.714 --> 22:38.834
Those are some hot theaters.

22:38.854 --> 22:40.759
What the hell's he doing in Tallinn?

22:41.704 --> 22:42.886
Really?

22:43.500 --> 22:45.590
Medevac or whack-evac?

22:46.098 --> 22:47.794
Okay.

22:47.814 --> 22:49.634
Yeah. Thanks, Derek.

22:49.654 --> 22:50.814
Appreciate it. I owe you.

23:04.664 --> 23:05.744
Fuck.

23:19.664 --> 23:21.049
There's nothing here.

23:21.069 --> 23:23.834
At least you're out in the sun.
No windows gets old.

23:23.854 --> 23:26.704
You don't have another op
that you're running?

23:26.724 --> 23:28.714
I can't confirm or deny.

23:28.734 --> 23:30.267
I do have a hot date tonight

23:30.292 --> 23:32.714
with the son of a Nigerian scientist.

23:32.734 --> 23:33.812
Wait.

23:34.704 --> 23:35.981
Here it is.

23:36.754 --> 23:37.844
I got it.

23:39.834 --> 23:45.157
There's definitely something
been over these tracks.

23:45.949 --> 23:47.714
Brush is flattened.

23:47.734 --> 23:50.644
Not as defunct as someone
wants the world to believe.

23:50.664 --> 23:52.956
There's no other sign of activity nearby.

23:53.469 --> 23:54.724
No tire tracks.

23:54.744 --> 23:56.734
Why did it stop here?

23:59.129 --> 24:00.834
Follow the tracks west.

24:01.339 --> 24:05.704
There's an old Soviet complex.
Medium-range ballistic missiles.

24:05.724 --> 24:08.404
It's probably the reason for the
rail line in the first place.

24:08.424 --> 24:09.814
I'm gonna check it out.

24:10.599 --> 24:13.804
For the record, I hate this remote shit.

24:13.824 --> 24:15.020
I wish I had your back.

24:15.371 --> 24:16.844
I like your voice in my ear.

24:16.864 --> 24:18.804
You'll be hearing it again soon.

24:18.824 --> 24:20.684
Be careful.

24:20.704 --> 24:21.734
Sure.

24:37.684 --> 24:39.804
But, I mean,
Henrik had heart issues

24:39.824 --> 24:40.804
for what, two decades?

24:40.824 --> 24:42.794
Doesn't prove anything.

24:46.724 --> 24:49.634
Tox reports came back.
Hair samples were negative.

24:49.654 --> 24:50.814
Not negative, exactly.

24:50.834 --> 24:54.455
Henrik was seeing fucking glowing halos

24:54.475 --> 24:55.644
right before he collapsed.

24:55.664 --> 24:57.684
Visual hallucinations like that

24:57.704 --> 24:59.824
are a unique symptom
of foxglove poisoning,

24:59.844 --> 25:03.784
which is a purple flower
that grows wild all over Europe.

25:03.804 --> 25:05.774
So why wasn't it on the tox report?

25:05.794 --> 25:10.264
Because foxglove has the same
root chemical derivation

25:10.289 --> 25:12.694
as digitalis,

25:12.714 --> 25:15.204
the heart medication
he was already taking.

25:15.334 --> 25:17.804
So the poison would look like an
overdose of his own medication?

25:17.824 --> 25:19.704
- Is that what you're saying?
- Not even that.

25:19.724 --> 25:22.744
My research says that
if he ingested foxglove,

25:22.764 --> 25:23.754
he'd have a heart attack,

25:23.774 --> 25:25.744
but his digoxin levels
would barely change.

25:25.764 --> 25:28.301
He's right. There's a slight
bump in his levels

25:28.326 --> 25:29.764
but within the margin of error.

25:29.784 --> 25:31.794
So, we could prove that he was poisoned,

25:31.814 --> 25:33.844
but we have no proof
that he was poisoned.

25:33.864 --> 25:35.350
They're fucking good.

25:35.644 --> 25:37.754
Well, I obviously can't
take this to Langley.

25:37.774 --> 25:39.784
- Oh, I know.
- Russians are bold.

25:39.804 --> 25:41.764
They usually own their poisons.

25:41.784 --> 25:44.734
Why wouldn't they flaunt
and then deny as usual?

25:44.754 --> 25:48.844
Because the Crimean Playbook
relies on absolute secrecy.

27:40.764 --> 27:43.674
<i>Esther Krug.</i>

27:43.694 --> 27:45.864
Hey, it's me.

27:46.644 --> 27:47.854
I miss you.

27:50.824 --> 27:53.814
Listen, Valerie wants me to fill
out some forms in triplicate,

27:53.834 --> 27:56.950
something to do with clearance on "us."

27:57.774 --> 28:00.634
I guess we weren't as sly
as we thought we were.

28:02.674 --> 28:07.774
Anyway, I had this crazy dream
last night about my mom.

28:09.764 --> 28:11.579
I don't know if I ever told you,

28:12.591 --> 28:14.814
but I was there the night she died.

28:16.674 --> 28:18.263
I saw it.

28:18.527 --> 28:20.507
The explosion, everything.

28:22.475 --> 28:25.687
He had a choice, the guy that did it.

28:27.105 --> 28:30.714
He waited, watched her get into the car.

28:32.026 --> 28:33.754
I guess he didn't want any witnesses,

28:33.774 --> 28:35.734
but he didn't know about me.

28:39.734 --> 28:41.244
I saw him.

28:43.734 --> 28:45.784
I think I know who Diver is.

29:26.764 --> 29:28.834
And some cigarettes.

29:36.734 --> 29:37.834
Thank you.

29:41.654 --> 29:42.804
You got a light?

29:44.684 --> 29:45.794
Thanks.

29:47.397 --> 29:48.744
You from around here?

29:48.764 --> 29:50.724
We live here.

29:50.744 --> 29:51.814
Yeah?

29:51.834 --> 29:53.794
You all in a club or something?

29:54.359 --> 29:55.734
The Butch Club.

29:55.754 --> 29:57.634
I'm just messin' with ya.

29:57.654 --> 29:59.674
You're Russian, right?

29:59.694 --> 30:00.824
Estonian.

30:17.824 --> 30:19.359
No, I guess not.

30:19.379 --> 30:21.092
Well, it was nice to meet you guys.

30:21.459 --> 30:23.674
Got a beautiful country here.

30:29.674 --> 30:30.744
When I was 7,

30:30.764 --> 30:34.724
I was sent to stay with my
Russian grandfather in Sillimae.

30:34.744 --> 30:36.644
He was a baker.

30:36.664 --> 30:38.764
I loved to watch him work.

30:38.784 --> 30:42.804
I spread the flour,
picked up the scraps of dough,

30:42.824 --> 30:45.794
sneak a warm roll with jam.

30:45.814 --> 30:49.704
And then one day his shop was shut down,

30:49.724 --> 30:52.654
license pulled, no reason given.

30:52.674 --> 30:54.419
And as I stood in line with him,

30:54.439 --> 30:57.674
when we shuffled from one
government window to another,

30:57.694 --> 31:03.694
I saw on the cover of his I.D.,
it read "alien passport."

31:03.714 --> 31:04.814
I was a kid.

31:04.834 --> 31:10.834
To me, "alien" meant bad,
scary, different.

31:10.854 --> 31:12.814
This country wanted my grandfather

31:12.834 --> 31:16.065
to know he would never belong.

31:16.684 --> 31:19.844
Sama Kaart isn't just a passport.

31:19.864 --> 31:21.734
It's acceptance.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.694
A welcome home.

31:24.844 --> 31:27.694
Henrik led us here.

31:27.714 --> 31:29.644
Your Parliament voted.

31:29.664 --> 31:32.744
Our technology will make this possible.

31:32.764 --> 31:36.824
Now every Estonian
will have full voting rights,

31:36.844 --> 31:39.784
access to public services,

31:39.804 --> 31:42.734
and the right to work abroad...

31:42.754 --> 31:45.136
...without obtaining a visa.

31:46.664 --> 31:48.784
Today I say, no more.

31:48.804 --> 31:50.634
We are one Estonia!

33:14.283 --> 33:15.694
Uh, I'm sorry.

33:15.714 --> 33:18.744
This sounds like we all need
to step outside.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.634
Please step outside.

33:41.704 --> 33:44.704
Hey, what's going on here?

33:44.724 --> 33:45.814
Getting high?

33:45.834 --> 33:47.734
You Australian?

33:47.754 --> 33:48.834
American.

33:51.754 --> 33:54.694
Is your country great yet?

33:54.714 --> 33:56.674
My country's fucked.

33:57.684 --> 33:59.814
Compared to this, it's fucking paradise.

34:27.664 --> 34:29.824
I don't understand what happened.

34:29.844 --> 34:33.774
Paavo was debugging the server,
and there was no fire.

35:56.714 --> 35:58.684
They're ripping her to shreds.

35:58.704 --> 36:00.774
- Who?
- Sofia.

36:03.734 --> 36:05.634
Jesus.

36:05.654 --> 36:06.804
You think it's true?

36:06.824 --> 36:08.962
I've been following her for years.

36:08.982 --> 36:09.975
I know her.

36:09.995 --> 36:11.774
Her app may still need some fine-tuning,

36:11.794 --> 36:13.734
but these make it sound
like it's designed

36:13.754 --> 36:15.694
to racially profile.

36:15.714 --> 36:17.774
There's no way. That's not who she is.

36:17.794 --> 36:20.714
Maybe she's not as altruistic
as you think.

36:20.734 --> 36:21.694
Look at this.

36:21.714 --> 36:23.133
The level of vitriol,

36:23.153 --> 36:25.664
the traffic volume, the repeated phrases.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.044
This is the hallmark
of a Russian troll farm.

36:28.744 --> 36:31.734
So a different kind of assassination.

36:31.754 --> 36:33.694
You think she'll lay low?

36:33.714 --> 36:34.754
Sofia?

36:34.774 --> 36:37.178
Not a chance. She'll counter.

36:37.764 --> 36:38.864
Sofia.

36:59.774 --> 37:01.754
Gaby and I didn't know any German,

37:01.774 --> 37:04.664
so we would just memorize
the autobahn signs,

37:04.684 --> 37:05.814
and that's how we found our way back.

37:05.834 --> 37:08.654
Literally, I would just look
for "Ausfahrt,"

37:08.674 --> 37:11.612
and that's how I'd get back
to the Airbnb.

37:11.644 --> 37:13.773
- Not realizing? Not
- realizing that "ausfahrt"

37:13.798 --> 37:16.047
<i>is</i> German for "exit," yes.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.744
A true Darwin Award moment.

37:17.764 --> 37:19.784
How does that story
make you seem even hotter?

37:19.804 --> 37:21.634
I don't get it.

37:23.644 --> 37:24.724
You know that guy?

37:24.744 --> 37:27.714
No. Maybe he knows my dad.

37:27.734 --> 37:29.744
Everyone knows your dad.

37:29.764 --> 37:31.684
The great Dr. Adeyemi.

37:31.704 --> 37:34.734
He can command an auditorium
of a thousand,

37:34.754 --> 37:38.654
but one-on-one, he's a different person.

37:38.674 --> 37:41.674
He's happier alone, locked in his lab.

37:41.694 --> 37:43.542
How's the project going?

37:43.562 --> 37:44.912
Almost done.

37:45.449 --> 37:46.814
Very mysterious.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.734
I'll tell you when the time is right

37:49.754 --> 37:51.854
or when I'm really wasted.

37:52.634 --> 37:54.674
But it's gonna be huge.

37:54.694 --> 37:56.634
Set-for-life huge.

37:56.654 --> 37:59.744
No more immigrant visas.
No more scrambling for grants.

37:59.764 --> 38:01.654
He deserves it.

38:01.674 --> 38:03.347
You both do.

38:18.754 --> 38:19.834
<i>People may be gathered</i>

38:19.854 --> 38:22.654
<i>to celebrate 100 years
of Estonian independence,</i>

38:22.674 --> 38:24.744
<i>but tensions between Estonians
and ethnic Russians</i>

38:24.764 --> 38:26.644
<i>have never been higher.</i>

38:26.664 --> 38:29.654
<i>Critics allege Sofia Vesik's
Sama Kaart program</i>

38:29.674 --> 38:32.754
<i>was really gathering data on
the ethnic Russian population.</i>

38:32.774 --> 38:35.764
<i>The Tervik CEO is scheduled
to speak here tonight,</i>

38:35.784 --> 38:38.754
<i>but with rumors of
racial profiling dogging her,</i>

38:38.774 --> 38:41.824
<i>it's unclear how welcoming
this crowd will be.</i>

38:46.674 --> 38:47.784
Torres.

38:47.804 --> 38:49.844
I need you to find Sofia Vesik.

38:49.864 --> 38:52.764
They're after her. She's a soft target.

38:52.784 --> 38:55.191
Sabotage, fake news.

38:55.684 --> 38:57.235
Where are you?

38:57.255 --> 38:59.694
Old Town Tallinn, Centennial.

38:59.714 --> 39:02.764
Well, perfect. Her assistant
said she's on her way there.

39:02.784 --> 39:04.794
I-I really wish I could help you,

39:04.814 --> 39:06.764
but I have a bead on Sergei, okay?

39:06.784 --> 39:08.694
He might even be here for her.

39:08.714 --> 39:10.784
Maret's apartment
has a clean line of sight.

39:10.804 --> 39:12.704
I think he's gonna make a move.

39:12.724 --> 39:14.784
Secure Sofia first.

39:14.804 --> 39:16.744
Is that an order?

39:16.764 --> 39:18.714
That is tactical wisdom.

39:18.734 --> 39:19.824
Secure the asset you can find

39:19.844 --> 39:21.824
before countering the shooter you can't.

39:21.844 --> 39:24.704
- Roger that.
- Thank you.

39:35.834 --> 39:39.854
Turba's a ghost town, empty.

39:40.473 --> 39:45.483
And then these <i> vastupidaz</i>...
How do you say?

39:45.664 --> 39:48.784
Uptight fuckers show up
in their dumb shirts,

39:48.804 --> 39:52.784
try to recruit guys, you know,
the militia types,

39:53.165 --> 39:55.664
some glorious cause.

39:55.684 --> 39:58.170
We can't even get high
in the basement anymore.

39:59.046 --> 40:00.714
How long they been here?

40:02.049 --> 40:03.704
A month or two.

40:03.724 --> 40:06.664
More show up every few days.

40:06.684 --> 40:08.014
On a train?

40:09.307 --> 40:12.744
You mean the secret train
we're not meant to hear?

40:12.764 --> 40:16.794
Which of course we all hear
'cause it's a fucking train?

40:16.814 --> 40:19.664
Yeah, yeah, that one.

40:20.654 --> 40:22.634
Did you find these in the basement?

40:22.654 --> 40:26.032
Dregs only. Thousands of them.

40:26.903 --> 40:28.023
Hold this.

40:35.664 --> 40:37.664
- Oopsie!
- Oh, fuck!

40:37.684 --> 40:38.754
Jesus!

40:47.694 --> 40:49.634
Come on.

41:31.664 --> 41:33.784
Fuck! Aah!

41:33.804 --> 41:34.804
What the hell?!

41:34.824 --> 41:36.814
Rafael Torres.
I'm here to look after you.

41:38.170 --> 41:39.804
You work with Daniel Miller.

41:39.824 --> 41:41.774
Yes, now get in your car.

41:41.794 --> 41:43.814
I need you to stay in here.

41:43.834 --> 41:46.724
They sabotaged my work,
and they killed my friend.

41:46.744 --> 41:48.654
I can't let lies speak for me.

41:48.674 --> 41:50.744
I need you to stay inside
your car until I come back.

41:50.764 --> 41:52.704
And whatever you have say,

41:52.724 --> 41:54.784
these people are not here
to hear it, okay?

41:54.804 --> 41:58.854
So stay down out of sight
and lock your door!

42:41.744 --> 42:43.002
Oh, God.

45:15.764 --> 45:16.814
Kaspar!

45:32.387 --> 45:33.834
Where have you been?

45:33.854 --> 45:35.824
I got a solid lead.

45:35.844 --> 45:37.784
Some kid who's been huffing rocket fuel

45:37.804 --> 45:40.664
from the silo complex showed me a way in.

45:40.684 --> 45:43.323
Wait, you've been following
some wasted huffer down there?

45:43.348 --> 45:44.824
It's where the action is.

45:45.225 --> 45:46.784
Listen, there's probably no reception,

45:46.804 --> 45:49.774
so give me 12 hours in the dark,

45:49.794 --> 45:52.149
and I'll call you by 10:00 a.m. SOP.

45:52.734 --> 45:54.684
You try and get some sleep.

45:54.704 --> 45:56.278
Fuck sleep.

46:00.694 --> 46:01.804
Okay.

49:58.864 --> 50:02.804
Is anyone hurt?
Were those shots meant for me?

50:07.266 --> 50:08.416
I was right.

50:08.989 --> 50:10.724
I warned them.

50:11.116 --> 50:13.714
Tonight was just the starting gun.

50:16.834 --> 50:18.704
Let's go.
