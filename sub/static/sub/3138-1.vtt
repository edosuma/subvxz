01:45.731 --> 01:47.529
- This is great, man.
- Look at you.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.819
- This one's a riot.
- That's so cute.

01:49.985 --> 01:51.908
- Guys, look at this.
- That's a keeper.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.573
- That's a keeper, Pat.
- Paddy, you are one ugly kid.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.367
- Hideous.
- A monster.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.910
- Prick.
- Asshole.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.499
Gentlemen, such language
in front of my girl?

02:00.662 --> 02:02.881
- She's not your girl.
- Pat is right.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.795
- Thank you, Pat.
- Hey! Well,

02:06.960 --> 02:10.008
look at what we have here.
The Flatbush Four.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.595
Or whatever stupid name
you call yourselves.

02:12.758 --> 02:15.432
Hey, where'd you jerks get the quarters
for these pictures, huh?

02:15.594 --> 02:17.688
You stealing from my old man's
till again, Sammy?

02:17.846 --> 02:20.190
Come on, Danny,
Sam didn't steal a thing.

02:20.349 --> 02:23.023
- How would you know?
- Because I did.

02:24.061 --> 02:27.110
How many weeks has it been
since you've been paid, Sam?

02:27.272 --> 02:28.819
Five?

02:29.441 --> 02:31.193
Six.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.495
So until he gets paid,

02:34.029 --> 02:36.657
we're gonna take everything
you owe.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.080
Nobody cheats us.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.665
Billy, you moron,
he'll kick your ass.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.455
That's right, moron.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.711
No one calls us names
except for us.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.598
This fight is gonna make us legends.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.058
Run!

03:09.314 --> 03:14.992
Kick, kick, kick.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.576
- L... Kick, kick.
- Kick, kick.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.491
Side, side.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.002
- Come on. Come on.
- And step, step.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.662
- What?
- All right, just do it.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.048
- It's good for your knee.
- It's good for my knees,

03:26.206 --> 03:28.049
but it's destroying my soul.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.334
Sam, shush.

03:29.501 --> 03:30.753
She can't hear me.

03:30.919 --> 03:34.048
None of them can hear me.
Looking good, Gloria.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.842
Oh, sorry, did I just step on your foot,
or was that your breast?

03:37.008 --> 03:38.885
- Row and row and row.
- See?

03:39.052 --> 03:42.147
Now, ladies, show us what you got.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.854
Show us what you got.
Come on, gents, you can do it too.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.644
- Ira?
- What, Sam?

03:47.811 --> 03:49.563
No, I was just... Just checking.

03:52.482 --> 03:56.407
Now grind it, grind it, grind it.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.793
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

04:03.535 --> 04:07.415
<i>My only sunshine</i>

04:07.956 --> 04:11.335
<i>You make me happy</i>

04:11.918 --> 04:14.546
<i>When skies are gray</i>

04:14.963 --> 04:18.887
<i>You'll never know, dear</i>

04:19.050 --> 04:21.473
<i>How much I love you</i>

04:21.636 --> 04:24.560
Pop, what are you doing? You're not
supposed to be lifting anything heavy.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.273
Man, she got a bit of an ass on her,
but I don't think that qualifies as heavy.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.403
- Okay.
- Let me take care of her today.

04:30.562 --> 04:34.942
Your only job is to relax. We don't want
another episode, do we?

04:35.108 --> 04:36.781
All right, I organized your medication,

04:36.943 --> 04:38.490
I programmed the alarms
on your phone,

04:38.653 --> 04:40.133
and I put the schedule on the fridge.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.406
<i>- Okay';
' Okay</i>

04:41.573 --> 04:43.200
Good. All right.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.583
Say bye to Grandpa.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.292
- Call me if you need anything at all.
- Sure thing.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.879
- All right. I put a hoodie in there.
- Bye, Blakey!

04:51.041 --> 04:52.384
See you this evening, sweetie.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.089
- The sippy cup?
- I hate that.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.333
Remember Grandpa loves you!

05:10.101 --> 05:11.899
<i>Hi, it's Vince with ShamWow.</i>

05:12.062 --> 05:14.190
<i>You'll be saying "Wow!"
every time you use this towel.</i>

05:14.356 --> 05:17.075
<i>It's like a shammy, it's like</i>
a <i>towel, it's like</i> a <i>sponge.</i>

05:17.234 --> 05:20.738
<i>A regular towel doesn't work wet.
This works wet or dry.</i>

05:20.946 --> 05:23.745
<i>This is for the house,
the car, the boat, the RV.</i>

05:23.907 --> 05:27.377
<i>ShamWow holds 12 times
its weight in liquid.</i>

05:27.536 --> 05:29.083
What?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.214
Go away, I got a bat.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.922
It's Elizabeth, your neighbor.
I brought you soup.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.007
That's why I have the bat.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.639
Hey, Mr. C. It's potato leek.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.470
Yeah, I know. Something funny
happened with the leeks.

05:44.636 --> 05:47.560
- Can we just pretend again?
- I can't wait to taste your soup.

05:47.722 --> 05:48.769
Thank you.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.693
You're welcome. Wait, there's a free
concert tonight in Prospect Park,

05:51.852 --> 05:53.445
and I was gonna take
my grandmother,

05:53.603 --> 05:56.447
and I thought you two might,
I don't know, get along okay.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.404
- Elizabeth. Elizabeth.
- She's really funny.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.319
Listen please.
You're a pretty young lady.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.953
I bet the boys are attracted to you

06:02.112 --> 06:03.955
as long as you don't give them
anything to eat.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.367
But I have a word of advice:
find a man,

06:06.533 --> 06:08.535
don't let him get anywhere
near your kitchen,

06:08.702 --> 06:10.454
get him married to you
or your grandmother,

06:10.620 --> 06:12.247
and please just give me some peace.

06:12.414 --> 06:15.258
It's been almost a year
since Sophie died.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.635
Find a man.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.381
And stop bringing me soup.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.776
Are you kidding? That's great news.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.817
And we're expanding our offices
right with you.

06:39.983 --> 06:42.862
We're gonna be turning
a lot of heads. I love it.

06:43.028 --> 06:46.123
Maybe we should go public.
I'm not crazy.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.579
I got you, Carl, you're a genius.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.371
- Honey, we're going to be late.
- I know, I'm almost ready.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.098
But you don't even have
your clothes on.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.175
Oh, because I thought
I would just wear this.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.343
- Love you.
- Love you too.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.257
No, not you, Carl.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.722
The news is great,
and before you change your mind,

07:06.885 --> 07:08.011
I'm gonna hang up right now.

07:27.739 --> 07:31.084
Ronnie, when you were feeling low,

07:31.660 --> 07:33.833
you remember what I said?

07:36.247 --> 07:37.840
Shit.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.885
Ronnie,

07:44.297 --> 07:46.550
when you were feeling low...

07:47.884 --> 07:50.353
you remember what I said to you.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.731
"Ronnie, I know
you're down in the dumps,

07:56.893 --> 07:59.612
but as a fellow bachelor,
I know you're gonna bounce back,

07:59.771 --> 08:02.570
because you may not be smart

08:02.732 --> 08:05.281
and you may not be
good-looking,

08:05.443 --> 08:10.165
but you got one thing
that every woman loves.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.418
You have
an enormous beach house."

08:16.788 --> 08:20.543
And that's why, when they called me
and told me that my friend,

08:21.084 --> 08:24.964
my mentor had passed away
peacefully in his bed,

08:25.130 --> 08:28.475
I said, "That's exactly
how he would have wanted it."

08:29.259 --> 08:32.763
Except maybe with a young redhead
lying on top of him.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.615
You know why Ronnie
died in his bed?

08:51.489 --> 08:55.039
Because for two years
he never got out of that damn bed.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.169
I got a beautiful,
young girlfriend here,

08:57.328 --> 08:59.672
who guys half my age
are drooling over.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.797
I'd marry her
before I'd give up like Ronnie.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.767
I said it, babe.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.303
So, what do you think?

09:14.554 --> 09:15.897
You want to get hitched?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.483
Yes.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.359
Sorry.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.572
I'm sorry.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.412
So sorry.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.908
Ronnie, I'll see you in 30 years, pal.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.503
We bought this toy ring at CVS
on our way home yesterday.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.959
Yeah, this is just a temporary one.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.965
- So sweet.
- Until we get the real thing.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.468
- Yeah.
- By which he means the biggest one.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.256
Hello, Billy.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.303
Hey, Neil.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.678
Your daughter got this engagement
party together pretty fast, huh?

09:54.844 --> 09:58.314
Yeah, she probably didn't want
to waste a lot of time, considering.

09:59.641 --> 10:02.144
Yeah. Yeah.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.532
Excuse me one minute, please.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.119
Where...?
Where'd you get that bottle?

10:11.986 --> 10:14.267
Ran out of Scotch, found this
in the back of that cabinet.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.249
No, no, no. You...
You don't want to open that.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.250
No, no.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.263
Hello?

10:31.422 --> 10:33.595
Hey, is this the bionic man?

10:33.758 --> 10:36.386
Hey, Billy, how you doing?
What's going on?

10:36.553 --> 10:39.397
- What are you whispering about?
- Oh, Miriam dragged me

10:39.556 --> 10:41.604
to a hideous dinner party.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.940
I'm just going through someone
named Abraham Rosenbaum's

10:45.103 --> 10:46.821
medicine cabinet.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.278
He's got some very deadly shit here.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.193
- Hang on, let me patch in Archie.
- <i>Okay.</i>

10:52.360 --> 10:54.158
<i>all these guys? Are you insane?</i>

10:54.320 --> 10:56.789
- <i>At least I have</i> a <i>husband.</i>
- <i>Oh, whatev...</i>

11:00.076 --> 11:02.750
- Clayton residence.
- How you feeling, Arch?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.665
Billy, hey, hey! How you doing?

11:05.832 --> 11:08.711
I'm just sitting here watching
this Housewives thing.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.299
Horrible people, horrible.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.304
- Hey, Arch.
- <i>Hey,</i> Sam.

11:12.463 --> 11:15.091
- How's the titanium hip, man?
- No, the hip was last year.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.805
It's my knee. It's great, yeah.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.728
I'm thinking about having
my balls done next.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.604
All right, listen, guys. I got something
important here, all right?

11:23.766 --> 11:26.315
- Oh, shit, Billy.
- Heart or cancer?

11:26.477 --> 11:27.524
Prostate? What?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.281
Why every time the phone rings,
you think somebody's dying?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.520
I live in Florida now.
Usually, when the phone rings,

11:32.650 --> 11:35.073
- somebody is dying.
- No, I'm getting married.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.283
What?

11:36.988 --> 11:38.706
<i>To that lady who's half your age?</i>

11:38.865 --> 11:42.540
- She's almost 32.
- I have a hemorrhoid that's almost 32.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.000
Now, look, Archie,
by the time she's my age,

11:45.163 --> 11:46.506
okay, I'll be...

11:46.664 --> 11:49.167
- Dead. You'll be dead, Billy.
- Billy, Billy, Billy.

11:49.334 --> 11:52.178
You've got your whole
what's left of your life ahead of you.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.930
I mean, you know. Look at Archie.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.340
<i>He's divorced and miserable.</i>

11:55.506 --> 11:57.008
I've been married almost 40 years,

11:57.175 --> 11:58.927
and I wish I was as miserable
as Archie.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.693
Can you guys maybe give me
a little support as my dearest friends?

12:01.846 --> 12:03.814
- How about it?
- Sorry, you're right, sorry.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.192
Yes, good... It's good news.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.712
<i>We're happy
you're getting married.</i>

12:07.852 --> 12:10.776
Right. So...?
So how'd you pop the question?

12:10.939 --> 12:12.139
You remember my friend Ronnie,

12:12.273 --> 12:14.025
the guy I worked with,
who trained me?

12:14.192 --> 12:15.819
- Yeah, yeah, love that guy.
- Good guy.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.282
Yeah, well, he died. I...

12:17.445 --> 12:19.288
I proposed at the funeral.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.703
I got nothing. Arch?

12:25.703 --> 12:27.797
So, Lisa, she doesn't
want a big wedding or anything,

12:27.956 --> 12:30.550
so we're gonna get married
in Vegas this weekend.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.802
So we're gonna have
a bachelor party in Vegas.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.214
- No, no, come on, forget it.
- No, no, no, yes, we are.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.780
- <i>We</i> are.
- <i>It's your first wedding.</i>

12:36.923 --> 12:38.721
You threw all of our bachelor parties
for us.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.484
- Two for me.
- Yeah, but we got no time.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.763
- We're getting married on Sunday.
- <i>Billy.</i>

12:42.929 --> 12:44.609
So we... No, it's fine.
We fly in on Friday,

12:44.764 --> 12:46.937
Saturday we give... We give you
the best bachelor party

12:47.100 --> 12:48.522
in the history of mankind,

12:48.685 --> 12:50.983
and then on Sunday
your child-bride flies in and...

12:52.397 --> 12:53.444
Are you serious?

12:53.606 --> 12:54.653
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.615
Billy, it is 4:15 in the afternoon,

12:57.777 --> 12:59.154
and I'm at a dinner party.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.822
<i>If I don't get out of here soon,</i>

13:00.989 --> 13:05.119
I'm gonna swallow all of
Abe Rosenbaum's pills at once.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.414
- What about you, Arch?
- <i>My</i> son <i>won't let</i> me go.

13:08.579 --> 13:11.799
I can't smoke, drink, eat salt,
or stay out past 9:00, but...

13:11.958 --> 13:14.711
- Archie's in.
- All right, all right! No, I love this.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.471
- This is great, man.
- We're invincible, baby.

13:17.630 --> 13:21.555
- Flatbush Four, we ride again.
- The Flatbush Four, yes.

13:21.718 --> 13:25.393
Yeah, so who's gonna call
Captain Sunshine?

13:26.556 --> 13:27.933
- Billy.
- <i>Look,</i> guys...

13:28.099 --> 13:30.352
I know he hates me now,
but he's got to be there.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.021
<i>You know it, I know it,</i>

13:33.187 --> 13:35.227
so do me a favor.
You guys figure it out, all right?

13:35.273 --> 13:38.447
- I got to go now, I'm hanging up.
- Wait, wait, Billy, Billy.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.747
<i>All right, I'll lie to my son,
you tell your wife.</i>

13:48.661 --> 13:49.833
Okay.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.873
So your rental car confirmation
is in your bag.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.508
And when you get to New York,

13:53.666 --> 13:55.589
just follow the directions
to Archie's house.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.550
- Good.
- You getting excited?

13:58.046 --> 13:59.764
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.721
Bachelor party in Vegas
with a bunch of old fogies. I...

14:02.884 --> 14:05.103
- Oh, come on.
- You're angry at me,

14:05.261 --> 14:07.542
- you don't want me to go. I'll stay.
- No, I'm not angry.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.523
No, don't. Just...

14:12.560 --> 14:15.279
Don't open it
until you get to Las Vegas.

14:16.439 --> 14:19.238
- What is it?
- No, honey, just leave it until you...

14:19.400 --> 14:21.744
Okay, or now,
if you want to open it now.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.871
"What happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas"?

14:25.948 --> 14:28.952
A condom and a Viagra?

14:29.619 --> 14:32.623
- Where did you get a condom?
- That's your reaction?

14:32.789 --> 14:35.338
I'm at the pharmacy 30 times a day,
I can get a condom.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.718
Sweetheart, you're unhappy.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.887
It's like the light has gone out
of your eyes.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.845
And the Florida jokes, they're...
They're getting tired.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.009
And I... I want my guy back.

14:45.176 --> 14:48.726
So I... I thought, if... If you...

14:48.888 --> 14:51.391
I don't want to know what you do.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.777
Don't tell me about it,
and we will never bring it up again.

14:54.936 --> 14:57.906
You...? Is this some kind of trick?
What...?

14:59.816 --> 15:03.241
- I'm afraid to get out of the car.
- Get out of the car.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.451
- Are you...?
- Get out of the car.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.830
Okay, love you.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.539
Love you.

15:32.765 --> 15:33.891
Ezra!

15:34.434 --> 15:37.529
- I thought you left for work.
- I had to make some phone calls.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.156
- Are you gonna get out of bed?
- No.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.192
Cold. Cold.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.612
Pop, it... It's sweltering in here.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.576
- Is it?
- Yeah.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.866
Listen,
maybe I should stay home today.

15:50.032 --> 15:53.161
No. You...
You don't have to do that.

15:53.703 --> 15:54.955
Thing is...

15:56.372 --> 15:58.170
last night...

15:59.250 --> 16:01.344
I peed myself.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.927
Oh, Pop, I'm sorry.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.933
It's just one of those things
a man has to deal with, alone.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.599
Okay, all right.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.142
Open the damn trunk, Sam.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.069
Wait, it's a rental!
I don't know where the thing is!

17:00.228 --> 17:02.697
Hang on, hang on! There it is.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.694
"'8 Open!

17:16.868 --> 17:19.497
- Let go of the handle.
- Sam, unlock the door.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.291
Let go of it.
Let go of the handle!

17:22.458 --> 17:24.050
- What?
- Just step back!

17:30.258 --> 17:32.056
GO, go! go'

17:32.385 --> 17:34.308
Seat belt, seat belt.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.724
- Archibald.
- Hey, Sam.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.233
You look good.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.235
You lie good.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.244
Yeah.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.080
There it is.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.249
- Let's start the gambling early.
- What?

18:02.415 --> 18:04.016
Hundred dollars
says Paddy will not come.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.668
No, no, he's got to come.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.133
Billy's come through for us
more times than I can count.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.468
It's our turn.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.260
Prick!

18:15.303 --> 18:16.725
Asshole.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.639
Hey. Good to see you.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.367
What the hell are you doing
in Brooklyn?

18:20.516 --> 18:22.077
I heard there was
a bathrobe convention.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.649
- Have I come to the right spot?
- Don't be a smart-ass.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.190
- Come on in.
- Archie's here too.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.780
He's out in the car.
He couldn't make the...

18:29.942 --> 18:31.622
All the flights of stairs
in his condition.

18:31.777 --> 18:32.994
- Archie's here?
- Yeah.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.156
- In the car.
- What's going on?

18:35.323 --> 18:36.370
Well, the three of us

18:36.532 --> 18:38.705
are gonna go to Las Vegas
for the weekend.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.625
Why on earth would I ever want
to go to Vegas?

18:41.996 --> 18:44.044
For fun! Remember fun?

18:44.206 --> 18:46.800
That thing you used to have
before the permanent scowl set in?

18:46.959 --> 18:48.586
Come on, I don't have
a permanent scowl.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.380
- He said with a scowl.
- I don't!

18:50.546 --> 18:54.096
Okay, it's not a scowl,
you're just ugly.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.429
Look, just throw some things in a bag.
The flight leaves in a couple of hours.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.115
Come on!
We're not leaving without you.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.936
Either you come with us,
or we move in.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.896
Hold on, hold on.
You show up out of nowhere,

19:03.059 --> 19:04.779
you say we're going to Vegas.
You know what?

19:04.935 --> 19:08.109
- This smells of Billy Gherson.
- Oh, Paddy, Billy Gher...?

19:08.272 --> 19:09.694
This... This has nothing to...

19:09.857 --> 19:11.985
Billy, we want him to come,
of course.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.653
But then he...
You know, he's got a big

19:13.819 --> 19:15.617
- important thing he has to do.
- Of course.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.141
He always has something important.

19:17.281 --> 19:20.000
That's the problem.
It's always about him, him, him.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.878
- What's that about?
- That's just Billy! Put it behind you!

19:23.037 --> 19:25.586
That's right, he's got
more important things to do.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.549
I have more important
things to do right here.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.881
What's with the pictures of Sophie?
They're everywhere.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.092
Everywhere I turn,
that's all I see: Sophie!

19:32.630 --> 19:34.431
It's getting a little morbid,
don't you think?

19:34.590 --> 19:35.716
Don't... Don't touch those.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.635
- Jesus.
- Okay, sorry.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.554
- I like looking at her.
- Okay.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.393
That stays there,
this stays here.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.729
Okay.
But you come with me to Vegas.

19:45.393 --> 19:48.693
Paddy, you have got to come
with us to Las Vegas.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.822
If you think
I'm leaving this apartment,

19:50.981 --> 19:52.198
you're dumber than that hat.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.032
Say what you want to me,
but leave my hat out of this, okay?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.741
My hat has never done
a thing to you.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.657
- I'm not going to Vegas!
- Paddy!

20:03.536 --> 20:05.413
What, are you...? Are you nuts?

20:05.579 --> 20:07.331
You're gonna give yourself
another stroke!

20:07.498 --> 20:08.545
Archie, you okay?

20:10.167 --> 20:12.795
- Is he...?
- The stairs. Paddy.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.714
You got to come.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.598
You got to come
to Vegas with us.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.389
- Please, Paddy.
- Okay. Okay.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.145
Okay! All right, I'll go!

20:21.303 --> 20:23.522
I'll go! I'm going!
I'm going, okay?

20:23.681 --> 20:25.604
- Great.
- I got to pack.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.860
- Prick.
- Asshole.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.362
That was well done.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.207
So Billy was so busy,

20:41.365 --> 20:44.414
he couldn't spend the weekend with
his three oldest friends in the world.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.669
Typical.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.172
Once a selfish bastard,
always a selfish bastard.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.674
Never changes.
Never, never changes.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.273
You know, that's the thing
about him, he's just the way he is.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.888
What was so important that
he couldn't spend it with us?

20:56.046 --> 20:57.093
So important?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.304
I agree with everything
you've said, Paddy.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.889
For the last four hours.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.230
Him, him, him.
He didn't even call.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.358
You know, he... A disappointment.
He didn't...

21:07.516 --> 21:09.860
He didn't even call.
All I can say is, if I ever,

21:10.019 --> 21:12.379
ever run into that son of a bitch
again, that prick, I'll...

21:12.521 --> 21:13.864
Forget it.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.775
- He'll regret the day...
- Hey!

21:16.484 --> 21:17.531
Well!

21:17.693 --> 21:18.740
- Surprise!
- Hey!

21:18.903 --> 21:20.530
Hey, Archie, how you doing? Sam.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.165
Hey! Fun. Fun!

21:23.324 --> 21:25.076
Hey, hey,
what's that hair color?

21:25.242 --> 21:26.642
- Hazelnut?
- Have you got more hair

21:26.786 --> 21:27.833
than you used to have?

21:27.995 --> 21:30.214
- Oh, stop it, will you?
- You've got more hair than...

21:30.372 --> 21:32.124
Where'd you get the extra hair?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.259
<i>His ass.</i>

21:34.418 --> 21:36.019
Hey, look, don't be upset
with them, Pat.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.888
- It wasn't their fault.
- I'm going home.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.049
Paddy, look,
I'm getting married, okay?

21:40.216 --> 21:42.184
This is a bachelor party,
I needed you here.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.811
- I'm going home.
- How many times

21:43.969 --> 21:45.209
do I got to tell you I'm sorry?

21:45.346 --> 21:47.706
You can't say it enough, my friend.
You can't say it enough.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.691
Every time I see you,
we go through this shit.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.694
One more word, I'm gonna knock
your block off like I did in fifth grade.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.902
All right, all right, all right.
Hey, hey, hey! Knock this shit off!

21:56.065 --> 21:58.159
The hell's the matter with you?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.911
Now we're here together,
the four of us.

22:01.070 --> 22:04.415
We're here to celebrate
Billy marrying an infant.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.166
- She's not an infant.
- Shut up, Billy!

22:06.325 --> 22:09.078
Archie, blood pressure?

22:09.870 --> 22:11.372
I need this.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.462
Sam needs this.

22:13.874 --> 22:17.549
And believe it or not, you two
jerk-offs need it most of all.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.305
Now, either you'll manage
to be civil with each other,

22:20.464 --> 22:23.468
or so help me, I'm gonna rain
holy hell down on both of you.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.136
You understand?

22:26.178 --> 22:27.225
Yeah.

22:27.388 --> 22:30.141
I'm gonna go find some damn water
and take all my damn pills.

22:30.307 --> 22:33.277
Then we gonna get
this damn party started.

22:34.436 --> 22:35.733
Yeah.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.569
It's gonna be fun.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.905
- Where to?
- Remember Binion's,

22:41.068 --> 22:42.661
where I had my bachelor party?

22:43.863 --> 22:46.457
I looked it up on the Google,
they've just renovated it.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.334
- Billy, Miriam gave me a condom...
- He won't shut up about it.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.666
- I won't shut up?
- You sound like 6 year olds.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.957
Billy, now that you've got
ass-hair on your head,

22:54.123 --> 22:56.717
do you wash your hair,
or do you just wipe?

23:21.025 --> 23:22.993
- Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

23:24.612 --> 23:25.955
Where's the check-in desk?

23:26.113 --> 23:29.117
- Check-in desk?
- For the hotel? Check-in?

23:29.283 --> 23:32.457
Hell, they closed the hotel part
down for remodeling months ago.

23:32.912 --> 23:36.007
Reopening next year.
It's gonna be real nice.

23:39.293 --> 23:40.545
We have a problem.

23:40.711 --> 23:44.557
The rooms aren't gonna be ready
for another year and a half.

23:44.715 --> 23:45.887
They're still remodeling.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.553
Archibald, did this topic

23:48.719 --> 23:50.471
come up when you made
the reservation?

23:50.638 --> 23:54.313
No, because you insisted
on making the reservations.

23:54.475 --> 23:58.525
I insisted, but then you insisted,
and it is the second insister

23:58.687 --> 24:00.815
- that supersedes the first.
- Sam. Sam.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.484
I offered, you insisted.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.371
Guys, guys,
don't worry about it, all right?

24:05.527 --> 24:07.529
Lisa and I are staying
at the Aria for the wedding.

24:07.696 --> 24:10.324
- I'm just texting my assistant.
- Yeah, see that? No problem.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.619
Big shot's assistant
will take care of everything.

24:12.785 --> 24:16.710
Meantime, I got to look for a bathroom.
Or don't they have that either?

24:16.997 --> 24:18.044
Okay.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.709
We'll go to your hotel.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.924
- But we're the ones getting the rooms.
- Yeah, that's right.

24:23.087 --> 24:25.840
Soon as I have a drink.
It's 5:00 in Florida.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.179
- I'll join you.
- If you insist.

24:28.342 --> 24:30.936
You know, Sam, it was you who
insisted on making the reservation.

24:31.095 --> 24:35.851
- And where'd you get that silly hat?
- Oh, why is my hat the default insult?

24:36.016 --> 24:39.896
<i>Can thrill me like you do</i>

24:40.104 --> 24:43.654
<i>And fit! my heart with love</i>

24:43.816 --> 24:46.911
<i>For only you</i>

24:48.654 --> 24:50.281
<i>Only you</i>

24:51.532 --> 24:55.628
<i>Can make this change in me</i>

24:56.078 --> 24:59.002
<i>For it's true</i>

24:59.915 --> 25:04.261
<i>You are my destiny</i>

25:04.420 --> 25:08.891
<i>When you hold my hand
I understand</i>

25:09.049 --> 25:11.768
<i>The magic that you do</i>

25:12.302 --> 25:14.851
<i>You're my dream come true</i>

25:15.014 --> 25:18.735
<i>My one and only you</i>

25:20.811 --> 25:23.030
<i>Only you</i>

25:23.772 --> 25:28.152
<i>Only you can make
This change in me</i>

25:28.527 --> 25:30.905
<i>For it's true</i>

25:31.655 --> 25:36.081
<i>You are my destiny</i>

25:36.243 --> 25:38.666
<i>When you hold my hand</i>

25:38.829 --> 25:40.831
<i>I understand</i>

25:40.998 --> 25:45.549
<i>The magic that you do</i>

25:45.711 --> 25:49.716
<i>You're my dream come true</i>

25:49.882 --> 25:55.730
<i>My one and only</i>

25:55.888 --> 25:59.688
<i>You</i>

26:00.934 --> 26:03.608
All right. All right.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.857
Terrific.

26:06.023 --> 26:09.698
Thank you! But all that tells me is
that wherever you guys are from,

26:09.860 --> 26:11.407
you lack quality entertainment.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.748
Okay, that'll do it for me.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.832
Make sure to tip your waitresses.
It's pretty funny when they fall over.

26:22.331 --> 26:23.423
Sam, Sam.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.663
No, she's good, she's good.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.011
My friends and I
would like to buy you a drink.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.005
You were the ones laughing.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.889
In that case,
I should buy you a drink.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.595
Oh, hardly.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.510
- I'm Diana Boyle.
- Hi, I'm Billy Gherson.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.019
- I'm Archie Clayton.
- Hey.

26:36.178 --> 26:39.648
- Hi. That's Sam Harris.
- Hey, Diana, please, sit down.

26:39.807 --> 26:41.901
- Let go of her hand.
- Thank you.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.612
You were...
That was just incredible.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.944
And... And I'm just gonna
preemptively just put my cards

26:48.107 --> 26:50.109
- on the table, and say that...
- Sam.

26:50.275 --> 26:54.655
My wife of 40 years
has given me permission

26:54.822 --> 26:59.578
to basically cheat on her
this next few days.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.917
And so I just wanted
to let you know, in case you...

27:03.080 --> 27:05.424
- I'm available.
- That's a generous offer.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.050
Are you good in bed, Sam?

27:09.294 --> 27:10.341
I don't remember.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.010
Great!

27:15.592 --> 27:18.846
Carol, could I have
a Sapphire Martini, straight up

27:19.012 --> 27:21.106
- with a twist, please? Gentlemen?
- All right.

27:21.265 --> 27:22.858
What...? No alcohol.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.438
- He won't have alcohol.
- What?

27:24.768 --> 27:27.521
Bombay Sapphire martini,
straight up.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.065
Don't pay any mind to him.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.609
- I'm a big drinker, I drink all the time.
- Okay, okay.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.277
- Bring him two.
- And I'll have one.

27:33.443 --> 27:34.615
I'll... I'll have one as well.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.701
So, what brings you boys to Vegas?

27:36.864 --> 27:39.492
I'll tell you what brings us to Vegas:
a big fat liar.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.161
I just wanted to come over
and tell you how much I enjoyed

27:42.327 --> 27:43.954
- your performance.
- Oh, thank you.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.001
You're no spring chicken,
but you deserve better

27:46.123 --> 27:48.251
than being around these lowlifes.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.715
Prince Charming, is that you?

27:50.878 --> 27:53.472
You are so much shorter
than I thought you would be.

27:55.757 --> 27:59.352
No, actually we're here for a wedding.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.809
Our friend Hazelnut
is tying the knot on Sunday.

28:01.972 --> 28:05.021
- Yeah?
- So, all right. So long, jerk-offs.

28:05.184 --> 28:08.028
I'm gonna go look for a hotel
that actually has hotel rooms.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.564
Wait, wait. Why are you leaving?

28:09.730 --> 28:11.528
Because of this schmuck,
that's why.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.818
We got a couple
of unresolved issues.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.285
Is he a schmuck?

28:17.196 --> 28:19.164
It's a gray area.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.371
We've been best friends
since we're 6 years old.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.333
My wife dies about a year ago, he
doesn't even show up for the funeral.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.622
It's a little more complicated
than that. I...

28:26.788 --> 28:29.667
Yeah, sends me flowers with a note
that says "Sorry for your loss."

28:30.083 --> 28:32.051
Schmuck.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.509
Well, I am sorry that you're leaving.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.015
Clearly I need someone
to look out for me,

28:37.174 --> 28:41.554
seeing as how I'm associating
with an alcoholic, an adulterer

28:41.720 --> 28:43.347
and a schmuck.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.685
I like you.

28:44.848 --> 28:45.895
- Well.
- Pat Connors.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.810
Still Diana Boyle.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.023
Diana?

28:49.186 --> 28:50.466
- Oh, look here.
- There you are.

28:50.604 --> 28:54.234
To the first bachelor party
I've ever attended

28:54.399 --> 28:55.992
that could be covered by Medicare.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.320
And to the only

28:58.487 --> 29:01.206
people here who actually
listened to me sing.

29:01.365 --> 29:02.617
Thank you for that.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.662
Hey, you, eye contact.

29:06.828 --> 29:08.876
Doesn't mean a thing
without eye contact.

29:12.251 --> 29:15.221
How old is the woman
that he is marrying?

29:16.046 --> 29:18.014
- She's...
- Oh, well, you know, she's...

29:18.173 --> 29:20.175
- Just in her...
- 30-ish.

29:20.342 --> 29:21.719
Oh, sweet Jesus.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.887
Guys, come on, we got to
get going here, all right?

29:24.054 --> 29:26.295
- Let's get over to the Aria.
- Oh, that's a great hotel.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.559
- Has my lucky big wheel.
- Big wheel.

29:28.725 --> 29:31.023
- Then you're coming with us.
- She is?

29:34.815 --> 29:36.863
What the hell is with this traffic?

29:37.025 --> 29:38.823
- Are you comfortable?
- No, I'm... I'm fine.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.910
- I can make him sit in the back.
- No, he doesn't have to go in the back.

29:42.072 --> 29:43.633
- Are you sure?
- Screw this, all right?

29:43.782 --> 29:45.409
- Let's just get out of here.
- What?

29:45.575 --> 29:46.975
- Let's get out. Screw it.
- Really?

29:47.119 --> 29:48.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.
Lead on, man.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.803
<i>Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!</i>

30:10.183 --> 30:11.400
What is that, a map?

30:11.560 --> 30:13.107
Look at them.

30:13.270 --> 30:15.147
The moron brigade.

30:25.407 --> 30:28.502
So now it's just me, on my own.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.085
There's this young girl, a neighbor,
she keeps trying to bring me soup.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.841
- Well, she sounds terrible.
- She is terrible.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.217
Soup's not bad.

30:45.635 --> 30:46.875
- Aria.
- Gentlemen checking in?

30:47.012 --> 30:48.434
Gherson. Gherson.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.019
I'll take that, sir.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.949
All right, gentlemen, I'm gonna
touch base with my bride-to-be.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.583
She has her own phone?

31:08.742 --> 31:10.210
Yes, Archie,
she has her own phone.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.570
- Not a toy phone?
- Children are learning more and more

31:12.704 --> 31:15.127
about new technology.
They're younger and younger.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.008
Oh, like a baby monitor?

31:17.167 --> 31:18.714
You guys finished?

31:19.378 --> 31:21.676
- Not yet.
- All right, huddle up, huddle up.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.554
You are surrounded
by slot machines,

31:24.716 --> 31:27.811
poker, roulette,
and there are girls at every bar.

31:27.969 --> 31:30.347
I want to hear stories,
I want to hear results,

31:30.514 --> 31:32.642
I want to hear all of you
getting in trouble.

31:33.183 --> 31:35.277
And I'm sure
this young lady can help you.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.187
See you back here.

31:39.481 --> 31:40.949
This is the one, this is the one.

31:41.108 --> 31:43.702
Okay, so put a dollar down.

31:43.860 --> 31:46.113
- I don't gamble.
- Oh, this is not gambling.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.452
This, my friend, is a sure thing.

31:48.615 --> 31:52.620
- Yeah, but it's throwing money away.
- Come on, Paddy, give me a dollar.

31:53.787 --> 31:55.164
- Perfect, we're in.
- Good luck.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.128
Come on. Come on.

31:57.499 --> 31:59.046
Come on.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.593
Oh, congratulations!
Five dollars off the buffet.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.382
Yes, we did it.

32:05.549 --> 32:08.553
Our lives are changed forever,
Paddy. Can you feel it?

32:08.718 --> 32:11.938
All right, Paddy,
you just won $5 off the buffet.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.065
- What are you gonna do first?
- Go to the buffet.

32:14.224 --> 32:16.067
He's going to the buffet,
ladies and gentlemen,

32:16.226 --> 32:17.728
the man is going to the buffet.

32:17.894 --> 32:21.114
Paddy, Paddy, Paddy,
the good news is that this hotel

32:21.273 --> 32:22.991
actually does have rooms.

32:23.150 --> 32:24.823
The bad news is that
none are available.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.243
Don't tell Billy, please.

32:26.403 --> 32:28.883
I don't give a flying fart about Billy.
Where am I gonna sleep?

32:29.030 --> 32:31.249
Well, they said
they might have some after 6.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.993
So here's the deal:

32:33.160 --> 32:35.333
Lisa wants me
to check out the chapel.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.835
She's got you on a short leash,
doesn't she?

32:37.998 --> 32:40.592
- Kids these days.
- Well, would Mrs. Don Rickles

32:40.750 --> 32:42.423
happen to know
where the chapel is?

32:42.586 --> 32:44.463
I do, and I will show you.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.007
- That's okay, that's fine, I'll find it...
- No, no, no.

32:47.174 --> 32:50.018
- I'm being wonderful.
- Take your time.

32:50.177 --> 32:53.181
Plenty of time. We got till 6.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.357
Blackjack. I used to like blackjack.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.238
- Archie?
- Archie.

33:06.276 --> 33:07.949
- I'm a little concerned...
- Yeah.

33:09.779 --> 33:10.905
Can I sit here?

33:11.072 --> 33:12.870
- Every time.
- Yes, of course, sir.

33:13.033 --> 33:14.876
- Yeah, sit down.
- Cocktail, cigarettes?

33:19.873 --> 33:21.420
- Sir?
- Yeah?

33:21.583 --> 33:23.381
Sir, I think she's asking
if you have

33:23.543 --> 33:25.887
any money in that
fanny pack of yours.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.131
Yeah, there you go.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.141
Excuse me, cocktails.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.723
Holy crap, what, did you rob a bank?

33:32.886 --> 33:36.766
Sort of. I emptied out
half my pension, $15,000.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.184
- What?
- You all right?

33:38.350 --> 33:40.148
Guys, come on.

33:40.310 --> 33:42.654
I'm on a weekend furlough
from prison.

33:42.812 --> 33:45.235
I don't know about you,
but I'm making the most of it.

33:45.398 --> 33:48.902
- Seriously, count a little slower, Ling.
- Come on, Paddy, join us, this is...

33:50.070 --> 33:51.117
Sorry.

33:51.279 --> 33:53.281
Kidding me?
It's like you did that on purpose.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.075
No, no, it's... It was just an accident.

33:55.242 --> 33:57.119
What are you, his bodyguard?
No, you know what?

33:57.285 --> 33:59.879
Thank you, guys, for killing
a really, really hot table.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.711
We're done.

34:02.290 --> 34:03.837
Fifteen thousand coming in.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.339
And on that happy note,
I've got a certain prophylactic device

34:09.505 --> 34:11.429
burning a hole in my pocket.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.559
I will see you gentlemen later.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.396
- Sam. Sam?
- What?

34:16.763 --> 34:18.231
Glasses. Take your glasses off.

34:18.764 --> 34:20.766
Makes you look younger.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.239
- He does?
- No.

34:28.190 --> 34:29.534
Hi.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.867
- Hello, sir.
- A gin and tonic.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.326
Right away.

34:38.702 --> 34:39.954
Hi.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.630
You have to see it.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.049
I'm sure.

34:52.215 --> 34:54.217
There he is. Hi.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.178
Hello.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.813
- Come here often?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

34:58.972 --> 35:01.066
It's a good place for me to relax
between shows.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.443
Between shows?
Your shows... Your show?

35:03.602 --> 35:05.445
Yeah, I love this place.
It's got a nice

35:05.604 --> 35:07.698
"anything can happen"
kind of atmosphere,

35:07.856 --> 35:08.903
you know what I mean?

35:09.065 --> 35:11.318
Oh, is that a wedding ring
you're sporting there?

35:11.484 --> 35:14.328
It is a wedding ring, but
the great thing is, I have permission.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.990
My wife is very open.

35:17.157 --> 35:18.204
Well, okay.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.456
Okay...?

35:20.660 --> 35:23.413
Okay, well, let me...
Let me buy you another drink.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.629
- I just have one question for you.
- What's that?

35:26.791 --> 35:28.885
What would my wife think?

35:29.169 --> 35:30.386
What? Hol...

35:31.212 --> 35:33.340
Excuse me, I just have...

35:36.760 --> 35:38.228
I'm... You're... You're... I...

35:38.386 --> 35:40.138
You're a... You're a trans...

35:40.305 --> 35:42.774
Trans... planted New Yorker?

35:42.932 --> 35:45.481
- New Jersey.
- Jersey? Oh, Brooklyn.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.271
You look fantastic.

35:47.437 --> 35:50.281
And I do not judge,
I make no judgments-.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.862
Oh, no, no.
No judgment here either.

35:52.025 --> 35:53.117
"Papa Don't Preach."

35:53.276 --> 35:55.745
- No, no, good.
- It's a Madonna song.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.579
I get it. You're Madonna.

35:59.949 --> 36:01.371
Hello, I'm Sam.

36:01.534 --> 36:03.207
- Sam Harris.
- Maurice Tischler.

36:04.579 --> 36:05.751
Yeah.

36:05.914 --> 36:07.291
This is it.

36:07.457 --> 36:09.050
If you're gonna
get hitched in Vegas,

36:09.209 --> 36:12.383
this is pretty much the least
depressing place you can do it.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.466
Hey, I like it.

36:16.299 --> 36:18.017
Well, good.

36:18.468 --> 36:20.220
I will leave you to it.

36:20.387 --> 36:21.730
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

36:22.514 --> 36:25.233
Welcome to where love takes flight.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.064
Hi. Billy Gherson.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.945
- Oh, yes, yes, Mr. Gherson.
- Hi.

36:29.104 --> 36:30.947
I should have known.

36:31.106 --> 36:33.700
I've seen a lot of couples
come down this aisle.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.202
I can always tell when it's true love.

36:37.070 --> 36:40.370
No, no, no,
this is not my fiancée.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.784
- No.
- Oh, no, no, no.

36:41.950 --> 36:45.545
This man would never marry
someone even close to his own age.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.456
So who are you?

36:48.873 --> 36:49.920
I'm his mother.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.880
So we got a lounge singer
of a certain age.

36:55.046 --> 36:58.095
- Oh, how delicately put.
- But not from here.

36:58.258 --> 36:59.760
- Atlanta.
- Right.

36:59.926 --> 37:03.556
In my former life,
I was a tax attorney.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.479
I raised a daughter on my own.

37:06.641 --> 37:11.147
Her father was an asshole
of epic proportions,

37:11.312 --> 37:13.690
and I got her through school
and...

37:13.857 --> 37:16.986
Now, I am giving you the full bio here.
Should I stop or...?

37:17.152 --> 37:18.592
- No, no, no, go on, go on.
- Really?

37:18.737 --> 37:20.284
- Yes.
- Okay.

37:20.447 --> 37:21.949
And so a few months ago,

37:22.115 --> 37:25.039
I found myself downsized
and empty-nested,

37:25.201 --> 37:27.420
and I asked myself,

37:27.579 --> 37:31.959
"What do you really want to do
with your life, Diana Boyle?"

37:32.125 --> 37:35.925
And what I really wanted to do
was sing.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.215
<i>I'm</i> a <i>little old for American Idol.</i>

37:38.381 --> 37:41.055
So I figured Vegas.

37:41.217 --> 37:44.892
And so, you know,
as they say, it goes.

37:45.054 --> 37:48.354
A big shot at Binion's needed
some legal advice,

37:48.516 --> 37:53.067
so basically, I got that gig
sewed up till I drop.

37:55.899 --> 37:58.152
It was nice of you
to walk me to my car.

37:58.318 --> 38:03.449
Oh, well, it was nice of you
to walk me to the chapel.

38:04.949 --> 38:09.671
You know, you are not as charming
as you think you are.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.795
Well, no one could be, quite frankly.

38:16.085 --> 38:17.428
It was nice.

38:18.338 --> 38:22.593
Congratulations! So long, schmuck!

38:29.724 --> 38:31.442
Hey, babe.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.358
No, no, I just came from...

38:34.521 --> 38:36.023
Yeah.

38:36.189 --> 38:38.612
It's interesting. It's...

38:38.775 --> 38:39.822
No, you're gonna love it.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.452
You're really gonna love it.

38:41.611 --> 38:42.954
- Surgery?
- Yeah.

38:43.112 --> 38:46.457
- That's... That's a game-changer.
- Well, it's just a big commitment.

38:46.616 --> 38:49.290
There's no going back, you know.
It's not the pain,

38:49.452 --> 38:51.852
- I mean, it's the recovery time.
- How long is the recovery?

38:51.996 --> 38:54.237
It's like eight to 12 weeks.
It's hard for a man to take.

38:54.374 --> 38:56.297
- So he's out for the season.
- Totally out.

38:56.459 --> 38:59.008
That's why you gotta go
with the Packers, and the points.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.013
- All the girls are making the same bet.
- Sam.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.970
- It's a no-brainer.
- Sam!

39:03.132 --> 39:04.850
Come on, come on.

39:06.511 --> 39:07.888
Nice to meet you. Madonna, Cher.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.647
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- Call me. Call me.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.774
Sam, where have you been?

39:11.933 --> 39:13.606
I've been working the room.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.486
You gotta stop him.
You gotta stop him.

39:15.645 --> 39:17.238
- What? Stop what?
- Archie, he lost it.

39:17.397 --> 39:18.444
Lost what?

39:23.111 --> 39:24.408
Archie?

39:38.751 --> 39:40.753
I'm so sorry, Archie.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.554
I begged and I begged him,
he just wouldn't stop.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.015
- I don't know what to say.
- Yeah, well, okay.

39:50.972 --> 39:52.098
Another bet, sir?

39:52.849 --> 39:54.271
How much was that last bet?

39:54.434 --> 39:56.562
- Nine thousand.
- He lost 9,000?

39:58.021 --> 39:59.501
- How much left?
- What are you doing?

39:59.522 --> 40:00.739
Let me count.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.701
You started with 15,000.

40:03.860 --> 40:05.203
Now you have...

40:06.738 --> 40:08.035
102,000, sir.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.497
Okay, I'm done.

40:16.706 --> 40:19.084
- Hundred and two thousand?
- That's enough.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.423
- Yeah, that's a good decision.
- Excuse me, sir,

40:21.586 --> 40:22.758
are you a guest in the hotel?

40:22.921 --> 40:25.219
Oh, we were... We really...
We've gotta...

40:25.798 --> 40:26.970
Actually, we just...

40:27.133 --> 40:28.806
Great game, great game,
great dealer.

40:28.968 --> 40:30.140
Great table, great game.

40:30.303 --> 40:31.395
How much?

40:31.554 --> 40:33.977
- Hundred and two thousand.
- Hundred and two.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.897
So, what happened?
We break a rule or something?

40:37.060 --> 40:38.740
Are they gonna take
his money back or what?

40:38.895 --> 40:39.942
I don't know.

40:41.814 --> 40:44.442
My son. It's Ezra. It's my son.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.077
Hello, Ezra.

40:46.235 --> 40:48.203
Wonderful to hear from you, son.

40:48.363 --> 40:52.664
Ezra, calm down.
Calm down. I'm at the church retreat.

40:55.662 --> 40:56.879
That?

40:57.038 --> 40:59.791
That was the Holy Spirit
getting into people.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.586
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

41:02.752 --> 41:04.800
- Praise the Lord!
- Ezra, I'm going to have to go.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.931
I think the Holy Spirit's
about to leave the room.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.138
I'm gonna see
if I can't stop him, okay?

41:09.300 --> 41:11.020
- I shall not want.
- I love you, son. Amen.

41:11.177 --> 41:12.895
He maketh me to lie down...
Did he buy it?

41:13.054 --> 41:15.022
I don't know, I was improvising,
same <i>as</i> you.

41:15.181 --> 41:16.433
<i>Well...</i>

41:18.476 --> 41:20.103
- He... He walketh me.
- Hello.

41:20.269 --> 41:22.067
The Lord is my shepherd.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.449
- Praise the...
- It's Billy. Billy!

41:24.607 --> 41:25.984
<i>I'm at the pool.</i>

41:26.150 --> 41:27.777
- He's at the pool.
- What's he doing?

41:27.944 --> 41:30.038
- What's at the pool?
- Where is the pool?

41:30.363 --> 41:31.706
Welcome to Las Vegas.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.081
- Yes!
- Yeah.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.413
- Relax, Gherson.
- Yeah.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.873
It's not like you invented it.

41:37.370 --> 41:39.122
Oh, Jesus.

41:45.628 --> 41:48.006
We got a bikini contest coming up!

41:49.007 --> 41:50.884
Who wants to be a judge?

41:51.050 --> 41:52.768
<i>L</i> do!

41:56.264 --> 42:00.189
Idea. Let's see
what we can do with this.

42:00.393 --> 42:02.236
Are you ready to Party Rock?

42:04.522 --> 42:07.776
I go by the name of Redfoo!

42:08.860 --> 42:11.784
Yeah, we got cash, we got prizes,

42:11.946 --> 42:16.497
and we got the best judges
in the world!

42:16.701 --> 42:20.331
Put your hands up, put your hands up,
put your hands up!

42:23.082 --> 42:24.334
Yeah!

42:24.500 --> 42:26.218
Well, check your pulse, fellas,

42:26.377 --> 42:30.427
because coming to the stage
is our first girl.

42:30.590 --> 42:35.391
She's from Seattle
and she likes to get wet, baby!

42:36.971 --> 42:38.723
Jessica!

42:38.890 --> 42:41.643
I love you, Jessica!

42:43.394 --> 42:46.614
Yeah, look at them assets, baby!

42:46.773 --> 42:48.116
Yeah!

42:48.691 --> 42:51.114
Judges, judges,
what you got for Jessica?

42:53.071 --> 42:54.823
Ten, baby!

42:56.074 --> 42:57.417
Ten!

42:58.910 --> 43:01.834
Ten! Yeah, baby!

43:01.996 --> 43:03.794
Looking good.

43:03.956 --> 43:09.304
Next coming up is Christina,
and she's a redhead,

43:09.462 --> 43:11.135
and let me tell you,

43:11.297 --> 43:13.470
it's au naturel, baby.

43:15.134 --> 43:16.761
Judges?

43:18.846 --> 43:20.063
Ten, baby!

43:21.724 --> 43:23.692
<i>Rena, baby, yeah!</i>

43:24.602 --> 43:27.071
Bring out Patrice!

43:31.859 --> 43:32.906
Come on and shout it!

43:33.694 --> 43:34.786
Baby!

43:48.459 --> 43:49.506
Yeah!

43:50.002 --> 43:51.424
Looking good!

43:51.838 --> 43:53.465
Yeah!

43:57.844 --> 43:59.562
Eleven!

44:01.889 --> 44:04.062
Let's get to know the judges.

44:04.225 --> 44:05.425
Can we get to know the judges?

44:05.560 --> 44:07.187
What's your name there, sir?

44:08.062 --> 44:09.530
- Sam.
- All right.

44:09.689 --> 44:12.818
Oh, and I'm available,
I have a condom.

44:13.359 --> 44:15.361
Oh, yeah. Yeah, baby!

44:15.528 --> 44:19.123
Who's that?
What is your name, party planner?

44:19.282 --> 44:20.454
Paddy.

44:20.616 --> 44:22.084
Paddy!

44:24.453 --> 44:29.209
Well, Paddy, I got a special package
just for you, baby!

44:36.424 --> 44:39.348
Yeah, baby!

44:42.805 --> 44:44.603
Yeah, baby!

44:47.018 --> 44:49.058
I don't know how Paddy
could have given her a seven.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.110
She was too young.
She shouldn't have been there.

44:51.272 --> 44:53.115
- I liked Mr. Redfoo.
- Who's that?

44:53.274 --> 44:54.794
The guy who put his balls
in your face.

44:54.942 --> 44:56.285
Oh, yeah, liked him.

44:56.444 --> 44:58.287
- He knows how to keep a party...
- Mr. Clayton?

44:59.363 --> 45:01.957
Quite a run you had at blackjack.
Can we talk?

45:02.617 --> 45:03.709
- Well, I...
- Apparently,

45:03.868 --> 45:05.836
you aren't actually staying here,
is that correct?

45:05.995 --> 45:07.292
Now, wait a minute here.

45:07.455 --> 45:09.298
Are you suggesting my friend
is a card counter

45:09.457 --> 45:11.337
because he took your casino
for a hundred grand?

45:11.459 --> 45:13.882
No, he won fair and square,
and actually we'd just like

45:14.045 --> 45:16.264
to have a chance
to win some of that money back

45:16.422 --> 45:18.140
by giving you someplace nice to stay.

45:18.299 --> 45:19.699
Hey, Alan, you wanted
to talk to me?

45:20.635 --> 45:21.807
- This is Lonnie.
- Hey.

45:21.969 --> 45:23.971
He's gonna take care of you
this weekend.

45:24.138 --> 45:26.561
With all due respect,
I believe I'm actually assigned to...

45:26.724 --> 45:28.397
- He canceled.
- He canceled?

45:29.227 --> 45:32.572
Yeah, give these gentlemen Villa 4.

45:32.939 --> 45:36.614
Are you sure he canceled?
I just confirmed with his travel a...

45:36.776 --> 45:37.902
Good day, gentlemen.

45:39.153 --> 45:40.200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

45:40.363 --> 45:41.831
Thank you.

45:43.658 --> 45:45.219
I hope there's room enough
for four guys

45:45.368 --> 45:48.338
because there's no way
I'm sharing a bed with this cupcake.

45:51.874 --> 45:53.751
The penthouse villa.

45:55.878 --> 45:58.677
Dollar for dollar, one of the best suites
in all of Vegas.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.432
Four bedrooms up top,

46:00.591 --> 46:02.434
fully stocked bar, gourmet kitchen,

46:02.593 --> 46:04.516
and all the amenities
you see before you.

46:04.679 --> 46:06.431
You know what I feel like?

46:06.597 --> 46:07.894
I feel like a damn princess.

46:09.308 --> 46:10.981
So intimate, that's what I love.

46:11.143 --> 46:13.521
I'm at your disposal for anything else
that you might need.

46:13.688 --> 46:15.565
Is that your job?
You're just here for us?

46:15.731 --> 46:17.950
You wouldn't believe who I was
supposed to be hosting.

46:18.109 --> 46:19.281
Who?

46:19.443 --> 46:20.490
Fiddy.

46:20.653 --> 46:21.825
Fiddy? P-Fiddy?

46:21.988 --> 46:24.537
- Fifty.
- Fifty people in here?

46:24.699 --> 46:27.077
No, no, 50 Cent. Curtis Jackson.

46:27.243 --> 46:29.166
- Oh, from the Jackson 5, sure.
- Yeah, okay.

46:30.663 --> 46:32.757
50 Cent's a pretty big deal
in modern times,

46:32.915 --> 46:34.838
and one of the perks of hosting him is,
you know,

46:35.001 --> 46:37.800
I get that second-and third-round
draft pick. You know what I mean?

46:37.962 --> 46:39.305
We don't.

46:39.672 --> 46:41.219
Like, the leftover...

46:41.549 --> 46:44.109
So I'm assuming you guys are not
gonna wanna visit our nightclub.

46:44.260 --> 46:46.262
Nightclub? Dancing?

46:46.429 --> 46:47.476
Yes, Mr. Clayton,

46:47.638 --> 46:50.107
I believe some people will be dancing
at the nightclub.

46:50.266 --> 46:53.019
Oh, all right. Okay.

46:53.185 --> 46:55.313
Usually gets jumping around 11:00.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.823
If you like, I can pick you up
or wake you up.

46:59.942 --> 47:02.411
- What are we talking about?
- That's when we come alive.

47:02.570 --> 47:04.250
Midnight at the disco,
we'll see you there.

47:04.405 --> 47:06.749
We're always up and about
after midnight on the weekends.

47:06.907 --> 47:09.427
- A little after, maybe.
- I'll leave you gentlemen to your fun.

47:09.577 --> 47:10.624
- Thank you.
- Keys.

47:10.786 --> 47:12.504
How do you get
these damn curtains open?

47:12.663 --> 47:14.210
I know how these things work.

47:14.373 --> 47:16.091
Let's get some light in here, Jesus.

47:16.250 --> 47:19.094
We've got one of these consoles
in every single room.

47:19.253 --> 47:20.630
Ready, one, two, three.

47:21.881 --> 47:23.849
Let me help you geniuses.

47:24.008 --> 47:25.055
The hell?

47:25.217 --> 47:27.094
- Okay.
- Oh, there's a window.

47:27.261 --> 47:29.309
Oh, of course, of course.

47:29.472 --> 47:31.645
A lot of times they just
put a light back there.

47:32.641 --> 47:34.643
It's probably fake. It's fake. I give up.

47:35.770 --> 47:37.192
Did you do that?

47:39.982 --> 47:42.610
Curtains, music, lighting.

47:42.777 --> 47:44.654
And if you're really
feeling adventurous,

47:44.820 --> 47:48.040
we now have color television.
Have a good day, sir.

47:48.199 --> 47:49.416
Oh, cute.

47:49.575 --> 47:52.044
Fellas, look at this.

47:52.203 --> 47:53.250
Oh, no.

47:54.497 --> 47:56.170
An old friend.

47:56.332 --> 47:57.709
Is that what I think it is?

47:57.875 --> 47:59.877
You mean you kept that
all this time?

48:00.044 --> 48:02.467
Goddamn right I have.
The Flatbush Four is back,

48:02.630 --> 48:04.428
and we're not on any
Brooklyn street corner,

48:04.590 --> 48:06.467
man, we're on top of Vegas.

48:06.634 --> 48:08.557
Celebrating my wedding.

48:09.387 --> 48:11.560
- Let's get it on!
- Let's go on.

48:11.972 --> 48:15.602
- I'll get some ice.
- Okay, all right, damn.

48:15.768 --> 48:17.736
Yeah, just like you, Gherson.

48:17.895 --> 48:20.096
Let's forget about everything
we've done to hurt people.

48:20.231 --> 48:22.700
Let's just move on
and celebrate me, that's all.

48:26.570 --> 48:29.369
Paddy, I should have been there.

48:29.532 --> 48:31.292
You're damn right
you should have been there.

48:31.450 --> 48:32.622
You should have been there,

48:32.785 --> 48:35.038
and, you know, she wanted you
to do the eulogy.

48:35.204 --> 48:36.831
She wanted you, and you knew that.

48:36.997 --> 48:38.965
She knew I would fall apart
in front of everybody,

48:39.125 --> 48:41.719
and she knew you would make
everybody laugh, Mr. Comedian,

48:41.877 --> 48:43.129
but no.

48:44.672 --> 48:46.595
You didn't show up,
you were too busy.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.475
Too busy for my wife's funeral,

48:48.801 --> 48:51.930
our Sophie's funeral,
so I had to do it.

48:52.096 --> 48:54.724
I didn't get one word out.
Broke down like a baby.

48:54.932 --> 48:56.058
I'm sorry, Paddy.

48:56.225 --> 48:58.227
No, you're a phony, Gherson.

48:58.394 --> 48:59.995
You always have been,
you always will be.

49:00.146 --> 49:01.346
Everything about you is phony.

49:01.480 --> 49:03.608
Your teeth, your hair,
even your tan is phony.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.447
Jesus, Paddy, you know, you...

49:05.609 --> 49:08.328
Hey, Paddy, come on, man,
for crying out loud,

49:08.487 --> 49:10.455
we're just trying to have
a nice weekend together.

49:10.614 --> 49:12.491
Nice weekend?
You call this a nice weekend?

49:12.658 --> 49:13.955
This is sad.

49:14.118 --> 49:16.086
I'd give my left arm to be
with my wife right now,

49:16.245 --> 49:18.498
and all Sammy wants to do
is cheat on his.

49:18.664 --> 49:21.087
And, Archie, you're on some sort of
self-destructive bender,

49:21.250 --> 49:24.550
cleaning out your pension fund
like you're so desperate to be alive.

49:24.712 --> 49:26.885
And this guy wants us to validate
his marrying a child.

49:27.047 --> 49:30.142
Well, you know what? I'm not gonna
be part of this charade, not me.

49:37.766 --> 49:39.359
Naptime.

49:49.570 --> 49:53.040
No, it's easy as long
as you have a couple girls...

50:03.751 --> 50:04.968
Oh, my God.

50:05.127 --> 50:07.755
We've been here
like an hour, Billy.

50:07.922 --> 50:10.266
I think they're only letting
people with cleavage in.

50:10.716 --> 50:12.059
Screw it, follow me.

50:12.218 --> 50:14.061
Where are we going?

50:14.220 --> 50:15.563
Billy?

50:19.225 --> 50:21.944
So, what's it gonna take
for three VIPs?

50:22.102 --> 50:23.854
Who's your VIP host?

50:24.021 --> 50:25.273
- VIP host?
- VIP host.

50:25.439 --> 50:27.237
Oh, that's what's-his...?
Our friend...

50:27.399 --> 50:29.072
- Oh, yeah, yeah...
- Larry. Larry.

50:29.235 --> 50:31.329
- Louie. Remember Louie?
- Lorrie? Louis? No, no, no.

50:31.487 --> 50:33.740
- Larry? Larry, Larry.
- No, it's an "L."

50:33.906 --> 50:35.749
No, you got it all wrong.
We don't know.

50:35.908 --> 50:37.080
He's a nice guy.

50:37.243 --> 50:38.335
Get back in line.

50:38.911 --> 50:40.003
You sure about that, son?

50:47.586 --> 50:48.963
He's laughing.

50:53.801 --> 50:56.304
- Oh, y'all are serious, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

50:56.470 --> 50:59.644
Look, the only way you guys
are getting in there tonight

50:59.807 --> 51:01.480
is VIP bottle service.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.235
- All right, I got that.
- No, no, no.

51:03.394 --> 51:05.442
We got, we got it.
No, no, this is on us.

51:05.604 --> 51:08.357
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen. Okay, 18.

51:08.524 --> 51:10.822
- Here's my friend's ten.
- Yep.

51:10.985 --> 51:13.238
And I've got...
Here's one, two, three,

51:13.404 --> 51:15.406
- and five.
- There you go.

51:15.573 --> 51:18.747
And one for your warmth
and hospitality.

51:18.909 --> 51:22.004
- Eighteen hundred.
- Eighteen hundred what?

51:22.162 --> 51:24.381
Eighteen hundred dollars, fellas.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.130
Fuck!

51:27.293 --> 51:31.014
No, I got this. I'm up $102,000.

51:31.171 --> 51:32.263
We'll take the bottles.

51:32.423 --> 51:34.596
Bottle. One bottle.

51:35.718 --> 51:37.345
You shitting me?

51:40.514 --> 51:41.857
We'll take it.

51:55.821 --> 51:57.664
Here you go, fellas.

51:59.158 --> 52:00.205
All right.

52:00.367 --> 52:01.584
- Thank you.
- Hey.

52:02.244 --> 52:04.963
Gentlemen. Not too shabby, huh?

52:05.122 --> 52:07.124
- Not too.
- No wonder it's $1,800.

52:07.291 --> 52:10.044
Look at the size of this thing.

52:10.252 --> 52:12.050
Yeah, that's my boy! Make it happen!

52:14.882 --> 52:16.304
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:16.967 --> 52:19.265
She's on my lap.
There's a girl on my lap.

52:19.428 --> 52:21.522
- Do you mind?
- No, no, no.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.274
It's... It's titanium.
It can't feel a thing.

52:24.433 --> 52:26.401
What can we start
you gentlemen off with?

52:26.560 --> 52:28.938
- How about some Red Bull vodkas?
- Yeah!

52:29.104 --> 52:31.448
- Red Bull vodkas.
- I probably should take it easy.

52:31.607 --> 52:33.826
- How about just a glass of soda?
- Yeah, yeah, me too-.

52:33.984 --> 52:36.237
I feel a little...

52:36.904 --> 52:38.952
Well, I can't tell if I'm having
another stroke

52:39.114 --> 52:40.787
or if it's these dad-gum lights.

52:41.408 --> 52:43.456
What's with you guys, all right?

52:43.619 --> 52:45.621
Today you were just fine.

52:45.788 --> 52:47.540
Now all of a sudden
you're like two old dogs

52:47.706 --> 52:50.255
being dragged out of the back
of the house to lie down and die.

52:50.918 --> 52:52.135
Three Red Bull vodkas.

52:53.087 --> 52:55.556
- What's a rebel vodka?
- I don't know.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.848
- He just asked for my number!
- Yeah, girl!

53:00.010 --> 53:03.389
Hey, Sam. Got a little bachelorette
party going on over there.

53:03.555 --> 53:07.605
I bet there's at least three girls there
that got some serious daddy issues.

53:09.019 --> 53:10.566
Archie!

53:10.729 --> 53:12.249
- You said you wanted to dance.
- Yeah.

53:12.398 --> 53:15.322
- Now's your chance.
- I'm still a little concerned about...

53:15.484 --> 53:18.829
Oh, no, no, let's not talk
about Paddy now, huh? Please.

53:49.309 --> 53:51.482
Boy, these "Red Balls" vodkas
are strange.

53:51.645 --> 53:55.195
I feel like I'm getting drunk
and electrocuted at the same time.

53:55.357 --> 53:58.327
And the music! Loud!
Like everything sounds alike.

53:58.485 --> 54:01.864
Like they're playing the same song
over and over and over and over again.

54:02.030 --> 54:05.204
I probably should get up and dance,
but I'm used to having a partner.

54:05.367 --> 54:07.586
Certainly doesn't seem
to matter to that fella.

54:07.745 --> 54:09.747
Maybe I'll give it a shot. Maybe not.

54:09.913 --> 54:12.666
Well, if they play something different.
Oh, shit, maybe now.

54:12.833 --> 54:14.176
Yeah!

54:17.379 --> 54:18.631
Go, Archie!

54:22.468 --> 54:24.095
Hey-

54:29.892 --> 54:31.018
Hello.

54:31.185 --> 54:32.232
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:32.394 --> 54:33.771
Can I ask you a question?

54:33.937 --> 54:36.690
- Yes.
- Do you guys have drugs?

54:37.649 --> 54:39.947
Does Lipitor count?

54:40.110 --> 54:41.362
So...

54:42.446 --> 54:44.665
what are you guys doing here?

54:44.823 --> 54:46.040
It's my bachelor party.

54:47.493 --> 54:50.588
I just think it's so cute

54:51.163 --> 54:54.007
when older people get married.

54:54.166 --> 54:58.012
- It's never too late, right?
- Right, right.

54:58.170 --> 55:00.673
Actually, she's not older.

55:00.839 --> 55:03.809
She's more your age.

55:04.468 --> 55:07.472
You must be really rich.

55:10.140 --> 55:13.110
You're kind of blowing my mind
right now.

55:14.186 --> 55:15.984
Yeah, it's just... It's like...

55:16.146 --> 55:18.399
- You're so cute.
- I...

55:18.565 --> 55:20.067
It's freaking me out.

55:20.234 --> 55:21.611
As I look at you,

55:21.777 --> 55:23.654
- Yeah?
- All I can think about

55:24.822 --> 55:27.166
is how much you look
like my grandpa Lou.

55:27.950 --> 55:31.079
He's in a nursing home
outside Fort Lauderdale.

55:31.453 --> 55:32.545
Who isn't?

55:33.539 --> 55:36.884
- Hey, angel, come on, get out here.
- Hey. Excuse me,

55:37.042 --> 55:39.090
I'm talking to another person.

55:39.253 --> 55:41.974
Yeah, but you should be talking to me.
I'm more interesting. Come on.

55:42.130 --> 55:43.382
Go away, seriously.

55:43.549 --> 55:46.553
You know, I just don't get it, all right?
It's not like you're married yet.

55:46.718 --> 55:49.158
Just spread it around a little
before it gets dusty, you know?

55:50.222 --> 55:52.566
Look you little jerk-off,
I don't wanna dance with you.

55:52.724 --> 55:54.164
I don't wanna dance with you either.

55:54.309 --> 55:56.107
- Everything all right here?
- Fanny Pack.

55:56.270 --> 55:57.988
You... You guys are everywhere.

55:58.146 --> 55:59.866
What's your deal?
Can I see that real quick?

56:00.023 --> 56:01.616
Buddy, maybe you had
too much to drink.

56:01.775 --> 56:03.869
Hey, pal, why don't you
mind your business?

56:04.027 --> 56:05.620
You don't wanna make
a fool of yourself.

56:05.779 --> 56:08.578
You know what? If I want your opinion,
I'll just beat it out of you.

56:08.740 --> 56:12.085
- Hey, hey, hey, what's the problem?
- Hey, hey, hey! What's going on?

56:12.828 --> 56:13.954
Sam?

56:14.621 --> 56:17.044
Now I'm gonna enjoy this one,
asshole. You know that?

56:21.461 --> 56:25.091
No one calls us names except us.
You understand?

56:25.257 --> 56:26.634
Paddy.

56:26.800 --> 56:28.017
Just get him out of here.

56:28.176 --> 56:29.769
- Take him out the side.
- We're going.

56:29.928 --> 56:32.181
Your son's been calling.

56:32.347 --> 56:33.644
Good shot, Paddy.

56:34.099 --> 56:37.228
Damn, fellas, that Paddy's a beast.

56:37.394 --> 56:39.192
There you are.

56:42.190 --> 56:43.692
- Lonnie.
- Lonnie.

56:43.859 --> 56:45.987
- I said that, man.
- No, you never did say that.

56:46.153 --> 56:48.794
- You said Louie or some shit like that.
- All right, I said Larry.

56:48.947 --> 56:50.699
- I said...
- Where you been, man?

57:24.608 --> 57:25.905
Thank you.

57:28.987 --> 57:30.034
Twenty-two up!

57:30.197 --> 57:33.041
<i>I need</i> a <i>pinch of sugar
An ounce of ooh-Ia-Ia</i>

57:33.200 --> 57:37.876
<i>A sweet temptation
tn my blue boudoir</i>

57:38.038 --> 57:40.132
<i>if you're feeling hungry</i>

57:40.290 --> 57:42.543
<i>H! let you lick the spoon</i>

57:42.709 --> 57:44.711
<i>Come on over, baby</i>

57:44.878 --> 57:47.347
<i>Can I borrow a cup of trouble</i>

57:47.506 --> 57:49.304
<i>From you?</i>

57:51.510 --> 57:53.763
I'm just gonna get some chairs,
I'll be right back.

57:53.929 --> 57:55.727
Okay, I'll wait for you.

57:58.767 --> 58:00.861
I used to be fun.

58:01.228 --> 58:05.608
She chose me, I mean, well,
over Mr. Ladies' Man, Billy Gherson.

58:05.774 --> 58:07.868
That's how fun I was.

58:09.152 --> 58:12.952
We both wanted her,
but she picked me.

58:13.115 --> 58:14.708
Picked me.

58:15.450 --> 58:19.045
And, you know, once I...
I made her laugh so hard,

58:19.204 --> 58:21.582
she peed her pants.

58:22.582 --> 58:24.050
Yeah.

58:27.045 --> 58:29.969
I used to be able to make
women laugh like that.

58:30.632 --> 58:33.135
Come on. You made me laugh.

58:33.301 --> 58:34.981
Yeah, but I didn't make you
pee your pants.

58:35.137 --> 58:36.855
Well, give it time.

58:39.558 --> 58:42.562
Hey, I didn't know her, obviously,

58:42.728 --> 58:44.651
but she sounds like
the kind of woman

58:44.813 --> 58:48.238
that wouldn't want you spending
all your time being sad.

58:48.400 --> 58:51.529
- No, she wouldn't.
- So cut it out.

58:52.029 --> 58:53.872
It's enough already.

58:54.489 --> 58:57.117
- Just cut it out?
- Yeah.

58:57.284 --> 58:58.877
Really.

58:59.327 --> 59:01.250
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

59:01.413 --> 59:04.257
If I threw a party,
would you be able to come?

59:05.876 --> 59:06.923
I might.

59:08.295 --> 59:10.343
Might's good enough.

59:11.715 --> 59:15.845
I haven't been this hungover
in 30 years.

59:19.222 --> 59:22.192
- Everything's spinning.
- I know.

59:24.728 --> 59:27.402
- Oh, no, don't...
- Oh, hi.

59:30.108 --> 59:31.735
Guess I'll see you in the morning.

59:31.902 --> 59:34.906
Yeah, and it'll be great to see you.

59:35.072 --> 59:38.042
That's a good idea.
I mean, I got all my best friends here.

59:38.200 --> 59:39.918
You should have yours here
with you too.

59:42.746 --> 59:44.043
Hey, honey?

59:44.206 --> 59:47.210
Let me call you back later, okay?
Yeah.

59:50.545 --> 59:52.513
- Hey.
- Hey.

59:53.673 --> 59:56.096
Excuse me, young lady?

59:56.259 --> 59:58.762
Bloody Mary, please. Extra bloody.

01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:05.227
Sophie wouldn't want me hanging
around the apartment in my bathrobe.

01:00:05.393 --> 01:00:06.861
- No, she wou...
- Shut up.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:10.900
So I'm not gonna do that anymore,
and I'm having a Bloody Mary.

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:14.946
I used to like Bloody Marys.
Maybe I'll like them again.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.541
I'm gonna ask you something.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:27.833
Do you love this Lisa girl
the way I loved Sophie?

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:33.923
She's a wonderful person,
really great human being.

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:37.013
Well, that's great. I'll vote for her
when she runs for Congress.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:39.887
Billy, you're gonna be 70 years old.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:41.851
Tomorrow you're marrying
a 31-year-old woman

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:43.560
who you proposed to at a funeral.

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:45.855
Now, I don't give
a flying crap about you,

01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:49.066
but if I did, I gotta tell you,
I see a few red flags.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:52.866
Tomorrow I'm gonna ask you again if
you love her. I expect a better answer.

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:55.944
He left his room.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.032
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:02.371
The old gang.

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:03.877
We're throwing a party tonight.

01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:06.333
Yeah, that's the spirit. Yeah, a party.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.089
- Happy day!
- Excuse me.

01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:11.836
- Oh, crap.
- I...

01:01:12.794 --> 01:01:16.594
I just wanted to apologize for...
For last night.

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:19.009
I was way out of line,

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:24.139
and, you know, I had too much to drink,
and I am just really, really sorry.

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:26.604
I throw myself at your mercy.

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:29.983
I was just downloading Dean
on who you guys were.

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:34.491
He didn't know that you were
the heads of four very influential

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:36.242
East Coast families.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:38.824
Yeah, I had... I had no idea.

01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:40.739
Well, I wouldn't expect
a dickhead like you

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:43.500
to know about legends like us.

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.706
- L... I'm a dickhead.
- Knuckles.

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:49.088
Knuckles.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.794
Knuckles, get the guy
out of my sight.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:58.177
Yeah. You know, you're a dumb
little shit, you know that?

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.059
- Oh, no, please.
- You don't know who these guys are?

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:04.472
Archie Aces, Billy Bones,

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:06.231
- Sammy the...
- The accountant.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.767
Yeah, the accountant.

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:11.904
Sammy the Stove, they call me.
I cook the books.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:14.440
I'm just... I'm sorry.

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:16.028
What do we care about your sorrys?

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:18.990
No, I know, I know, I know.
I don't give a damn about my sorrys.

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:20.529
Just please...

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:23.039
Shut up, shut up.
Just go get us some ice water.

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:25.792
When that's done, you come back,
you do some other things for us.

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:28.579
Maybe Knuckles here
will let you wash his balls.

01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:33.045
Sorry, that was weird.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.553
- Four ice waters?
- Go.

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:41.842
- What was that all about?
- I... You were great.

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:43.806
L... Maybe I overdid it.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:49.141
I obviously misread you guys.

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:50.900
You guys sold the shit out of that.

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.527
So, what do you guys want me to do?

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:55.530
Nothing.
No, today, you take the afternoon off,

01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:57.566
have another drink, go to the spa.

01:02:57.732 --> 01:03:00.155
Save your energy. It's gonna
be a big night for you tonight.

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:01.535
You got some thinking to do.

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:03.989
And we got some recruiting to do.

01:03:04.155 --> 01:03:06.578
Yeah. We need to recruit
some talent, gentlemen.

01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:09.915
Yeah, I want the A-list.
B... The double-D list.

01:03:10.078 --> 01:03:11.500
That is the A-list, actually.

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:24.594
I like this one, although,
is she throwing up or crying?

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:26.136
Definitely throwing up.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:30.774
By 6.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:33.735
By 6?

01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:10.847
My turn.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:20.778
Yeah, now we're talking.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:33.996
Yeah.

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:39.335
- These two, these two.
- Yeah, that... Yeah.

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:41.720
There you go. Oh, here, here!

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:43.398
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:45.633
Hi. Oh, thanks.

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:49.166
Girls, you remember Sam, right?

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.020
It's really gonna be great.
Party tonight.

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:52.852
Yeah, thanks. Oh, thanks.

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:55.604
If we were able to, I would release...

01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:00.522
I told you to put those
in one and two.

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:02.361
Okay. Oh, no.

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:04.151
- Take those back. I'm sorry.
- Where to?

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:09.038
Here we go. Let's do it.
Wait, are you...?

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:29.635
<i>So find yourself somebody</i>

01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:34.272
<i>You gotta find yourself somebody</i>

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:41.155
<i>You need to find yourself somebody</i>

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:43.022
<i>To love</i>

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:53.746
You guys just cannot
stay away from me.

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:55.330
You wanna go someplace?

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.753
Let me just check
with the crowd.

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:00.753
Okay.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:05.095
When you sing, I feel like a teenager.

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:07.802
And isn't that your whole goal in life?

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:09.261
<i>So sad.</i>

01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:10.971
You're right.

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:14.471
Can I ask you a personal question?

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.937
Okay, one personal question.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.896
Why haven't you ever
gotten married until now?

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:24.484
Well, Why should I?

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:26.991
I get to do everything I want to do
whenever I want to.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.993
I mean, what's wrong with that?

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:30.950
There's no mention of love?

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.907
No, no, no, I'm...
I'm not the falling-in-love type.

01:06:34.866 --> 01:06:36.618
Okay.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:40.793
Truth is, there was only one girl
in my entire life

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:43.208
that I fell in love with.

01:06:43.374 --> 01:06:44.876
I let her get away.

01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:46.886
Who was that?

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:52.600
You shouldn't have used up
your one personal question.

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:56.559
Oh, you are holding on so tight.

01:06:56.721 --> 01:07:00.396
Oh, Mr. Big-Shot,
I know where I'm taking you.

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:11.532
- Take a seat, please.
- You have got to be kidding.

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:13.867
What's the matter, princess?
Scared of heights?

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.998
Yes, the princess
is scared of heights.

01:07:16.157 --> 01:07:18.785
Well, I won't think less of you
if you throw up or cry.

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:21.671
Actually, I might if you cry.
Please don't cry.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:24.503
- I won't cry.
- Billy,

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:27.340
I think I have to ask you
one more personal question.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:32.055
What?

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:35.426
You're getting married tomorrow.

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:37.345
What are you doing here with me?

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:39.524
Well, you know
I'm getting married tomorrow.

01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:42.730
- What are you doing here with me?
- Oh, see, I do have an answer.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:45.816
L...like you.

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:49.324
I liked you from the moment
that I saw you.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.530
None of which matters
if you love Lisa.

01:07:51.693 --> 01:07:52.740
Do you?

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:58.366
What's...? No, no. No, no.
Oh, no, no. No!

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:02.288
No! No! No!

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:12.426
I knew you would like it.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.762
Oh, yeah, no, I love it, I love it!
It's great.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:17.768
Oh, good, because it goes
up and down three more times.

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:21.100
Oh, it... it's... What?

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:23.546
For a minute there, I thought
you were trying to kill me.

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:25.563
Well, you wouldn't answer
my personal questions,

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:29.607
so I thought I needed to scare
the answers out of you.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:35.153
All right, well, Paddy and I, right?
When we were kids,

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:38.538
we were in love with the same girl.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:40.078
Sophie.

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:43.916
She's the one who got away?

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:45.621
Yeah.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.383
First, you know,
it was just two best friends

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.886
competing for the same girl,

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:56.053
but as we got older,
it got a little more complicated.

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:59.264
One day, Paddy told Sophie

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:03.102
that she had to make a choice
between the two of us.

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:07.777
That night,
Sophie came to my house.

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:10.947
You know, she was confused.
She was young.

01:09:11.104 --> 01:09:13.698
So she picked you.

01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:15.201
Yeah.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:18.238
Yeah, she came and saw me first.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:21.787
But everybody knew
she belonged with Paddy.

01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:24.497
Everybody. So I told her.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:29.379
And then she went with Paddy.

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:32.881
Does Paddy know?

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:38.557
Oh, complicated.

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:40.684
A little bit.

01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:49.728
You know, the boys are throwing
a party for me tonight.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.988
Yeah, I heard.

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:57.152
Well, I would really love it
if you'd stop by.

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:04.329
Complicated.

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:07.290
A little bit.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.381
There they are. These are my...

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:15.716
Those are the kids.

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:18.131
And when they were younger.
And here are the grandkids.

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:20.182
Your son's son, and who's...?

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.218
- That...
- Oh, shame on you.

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:23.728
You don't even know who they are.

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.763
- Jason and Edith.
- Those are-J?

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:28.433
- Those are grandchildren?
- Yes, yeah.

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:30.897
The one with the bottle there,
she has a drinking problem.

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:34.230
That's a binky. It looks like a goatee.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:35.444
It does.

01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:38.485
- I got it.
- Our first guests.

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:42.121
Gentlemen, you have
definitely outdone yourselves.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:45.784
Yeah, I got a little something for you,
my best men.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.497
- Paddy.
- You shouldn't have.

01:10:48.786 --> 01:10:51.505
- Sam.
- Oh, you really shouldn't have.

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:53.132
Archie.

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:54.417
You should have.

01:10:57.628 --> 01:10:59.596
You asshole.

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:04.074
I can't believe this is your last night
as a bachelor, Billy.

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.646
You better brace yourself
for tomorrow.

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:09.227
But tonight, we're gonna party
like it's 1959.

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.313
- Yes!
- Yo, fellas?

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:14.900
I'm Stacy.
Which one of you is Sam Harris?

01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:29.877
Hey! Come on in, guys.

01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:31.288
Thank you.

01:11:53.184 --> 01:11:54.231
Excuse me.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:57.863
Sam!

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:01.033
- Sam!
- He doesn't know you.

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:03.320
- Do I know you?
- Yes! Come on, you don't recognize

01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:06.740
- the Material Girl? Madonna?
- Ma... Maurice!

01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:08.874
- Yes.
- You look different.

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:10.433
- Of course, of course.
- I'm sorry!

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:13.955
- Sam, Sam, this is my wife Susan.
- Of course, you're Susan!

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:16.670
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way,

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.677
but you seem like such
a conventional married couple.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:21.429
Yeah, most people think that.

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:23.635
But listen, don't get me wrong,

01:12:23.798 --> 01:12:26.642
everyone else I brought
is just a complete freak!

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:30.138
- Have fun dancing.
- All right.

01:12:30.304 --> 01:12:31.772
Thanks for coming.

01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:33.020
Yeah.

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:36.527
Hey! Hey! You've got... That's a guy.

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:38.858
Oh, there's a snake. It's a snake.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.294
Come on. I know you wanna dance.

01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:55.796
Yes, yes, but... But, see, I don't...

01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:57.832
I don't know this.

01:12:57.999 --> 01:12:59.376
Well, show me what you know.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:01.840
Well, I know some things.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:10.512
Everybody back up!
Back up! Give them some room!

01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:39.799
Child!

01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:41.300
That <i>was...</i>

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:43.673
May I have this dance?

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:45.971
I got you, babe.

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.924
Let it go, Archie!

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:06.993
Hey, Lonnie!

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:09.658
We got a situation.

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.621
- Listen. No, no, wait.
- No, I got it. Relax.

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:13.783
- Let me explain to...
- Relax, relax.

01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:16.202
- Lonnie.
- Fifty.

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:17.708
I thought you canceled.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:20.047
Shit changed, man.
I'm in the next room.

01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:21.926
- That's what's up?
- Think you can get them

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:25.178
- to turn the music down?
- Oh, no, man.

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:26.963
Actually, these dudes
are kind of just getting started.

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:29.882
- Think I could come in for a bit?
- No, it's a private party.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.596
- Come on...
- Needy. Watch him.

01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:33.181
- All right.
- Please, man!

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:51.241
It's the bride-to-be!

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:53.664
Oh, you're gonna
need this tomorrow.

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:55.166
There you go.

01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:56.913
Maid of honor!

01:14:57.076 --> 01:15:00.250
- Grandpa Lou!
- Hey!

01:15:00.579 --> 01:15:04.755
Thank you so much
for standing up for us at the club.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.636
That was so awesome of you.

01:15:07.795 --> 01:15:11.766
When you're from Brooklyn,
not getting involved isn't an option.

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:14.393
I am so tired of these young guys.

01:15:14.552 --> 01:15:17.180
They are so immature.

01:15:19.306 --> 01:15:24.153
Maybe I should spend some time
with a man of experience.

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:27.694
Let me show you around.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:31.201
Here, let me. There you are.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.081
Pretty girl.

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:45.757
Aces, I was just cleaning up
over here.

01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:47.964
Put that stuff down.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:50.346
- Go have some fun, you've earned it.
- Really?

01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:51.630
Really.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.424
Aces, thank you so much.

01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:54.888
Appreciate it.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:56.428
Oh,

01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:58.767
before you go, Dean...

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:01.182
Ask the girl to dance, don't tell her.

01:16:01.348 --> 01:16:04.648
Okay? Tell her how beautiful she is,

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.608
not how sexy she looks to you.

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:10.028
Tell her that from the time
she walked in here,

01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:12.444
you have not been able
to take your eyes off of her.

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:15.621
- That's kind of true.
- Okay, then go for it.

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:25.335
Definitely.

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:30.923
I'll be damned.

01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:39.803
The heck?

01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.648
Hey, Pop! Pop!

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:45.814
- Pop.
- Ezra.

01:16:45.976 --> 01:16:48.416
- What are you doing here?
- What the hell are you doing here?

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:50.781
- I asked you first.
- We were terrified.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.942
You said you were going
on a church retreat.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:55.453
We called the church.
Do you know how scared we were?

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:58.490
All right, I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't want to worry you about it.

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:01.455
Well, we were worried.
You can't do this kind of stuff.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:02.994
You're not a kid anymore.

01:17:04.411 --> 01:17:06.413
You know, you're right.

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:07.877
I am not a kid.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.259
I'm a grown man,
who just happened to go

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:12.840
to one of his best friend's
bachelor parties.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:16.014
As a matter of fact, I shouldn't have
had to lie about it in the first place.

01:17:16.173 --> 01:17:18.676
- You could've had another episode.
- Let's call it what it is.

01:17:18.843 --> 01:17:20.891
It's a stroke, a mild stroke.

01:17:21.053 --> 01:17:23.977
And it won't recur as long as
I take the damn pills.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.393
If it does, I'll just die, then, won't I?

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:28.311
Until then, Ezra...

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.150
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:33.065
Until then, I am not a feeble old man.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:35.280
I've got a lot of life left in me,

01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:38.116
and I'm gonna live it doing
the things that I like to do.

01:17:38.279 --> 01:17:41.203
One of them is dancing,
and the other one is having a drink.

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:45.336
I've danced.
Now if you'd care to join me,

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:47.542
I'd love to have a drink with my son.

01:17:48.706 --> 01:17:49.798
All right.

01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:51.004
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:52.752
Come on.

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:55.755
It's... It's...

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.514
Wait a minute.

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:05.014
Where was I? Yes.

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.558
- Which way?
- This way.

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:09.026
This is...
This is where it all happens.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:12.234
This was originally supposed to be
for a famous rock star.

01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:13.773
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:18.365
Fifty-Cent Piece. And he was
going to have a big deal here

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:22.077
with his groupies
and wild parties,

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:24.162
and the bed goes around, and it's...

01:18:24.325 --> 01:18:25.451
Now it's all going to waste.

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:28.955
It doesn't have to.

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:32.007
You don't think?

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:35.677
Good, good.

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:43.682
You just wait for me one second.
I'm just gonna take a pill

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:45.471
in the other room.

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:03.410
I don't need a pill.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:08.539
You...

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:19.047
I'm so glad I met you.

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:22.513
Did I happen to mention
that I was married?

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:25.019
Really?

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:27.430
That's kind of hot.

01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:31.434
It is kind of hot, isn't it?

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:34.194
Yeah.

01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:37.155
That's better.

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.195
Yeah.

01:19:59.253 --> 01:20:01.221
The thing is...

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:05.555
- You don't want to have sex with me?
- Oh, oh, no, no, no, I do, I do.

01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:09.063
Oh, God, I want to have sex with you.
A lot of it.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:11.098
It would be...

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:13.393
Oh, spectacular.

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:17.154
It would be the most spectacular thing
that's happened to me in 25 years.

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:21.025
Just... it... But...

01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:23.660
The thing is...

01:20:28.032 --> 01:20:30.080
It's crazy,

01:20:31.452 --> 01:20:34.752
but whenever something
spectacular happens to me,

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:37.666
first thing I want to do
is tell my wife about it,

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:43.181
and after 40 years of marriage,

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:45.262
if I can't tell her about

01:20:45.424 --> 01:20:48.678
something wonderful
that happened to me,

01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:52.523
it sort of stops being wonderful.

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.270
I understand.

01:20:57.978 --> 01:21:00.458
- It... It has something to do with...
- I mean, I get it, okay?

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:03.325
- She has a way of putting things.
- Will you just stop talking?

01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:05.862
- What?
- Stop.

01:21:07.946 --> 01:21:12.042
I really hope that I get to marry
a guy like you one day.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:16.296
I'm gonna get dressed.

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:23.296
You know, a blow job
wouldn't be out of the question-.

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:41.989
What a party, man, huh?

01:21:42.272 --> 01:21:43.319
Thank you, Paddy.

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:46.076
Just a little thing the guys and I threw,
you know.

01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:57.371
What?

01:21:57.538 --> 01:21:59.961
What do you keep looking
at the front door for?

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:01.880
It's Diana.

01:22:02.793 --> 01:22:05.672
I invited her to the party. I like her.

01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:07.298
That's okay, isn't it?

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:09.025
I mean, you said Sophie
wouldn't want me

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:12.018
to be miserable the rest
of my life, right? So...

01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:14.388
Right?

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:18.355
No, listen, I got nothing
to go home to anymore.

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:20.736
I got nothing, Billy.
I mean, it's an empty house

01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:23.443
with a bunch of photographs.
It's very depressing.

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:27.076
She, at least, makes me feel
a little bit alive.

01:22:27.234 --> 01:22:31.034
And feeling a little bit alive is a lot
better than just waiting to die, right?

01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:33.824
Right?

01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:37.169
Are you...? Billy, what's...?

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:41.915
Oh, my God.

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:43.129
You like her.

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:52.263
Susan, hi.

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:56.809
You're getting married.

01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:59.020
- But you're a widower.
- You said Sophie would

01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:00.685
want me to move on with my life.

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:03.400
- That's right. Exactly.
- Well, you know, I was wrong.

01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:07.448
You asshole!

01:23:07.608 --> 01:23:09.110
Asshole!

01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:13.914
You are so cool!

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:16.158
Diana.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.122
We gotta talk.

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.764
Hey, don't even think
about kissing me

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:33.551
until you've talked to your fiancée.

01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:35.977
Paddy's gonna ask you out.

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:38.643
That's why I want to get to you first.

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:42.518
Diana, you know
he's completely alone.

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.812
I just think you gotta
give him a chance.

01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:48.733
Okay.

01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:50.446
I thought...

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:54.743
Well, that's completely
embarrassing.

01:23:54.905 --> 01:23:57.283
I guess I misunderstood.

01:23:57.449 --> 01:23:58.621
No, it's not like that.

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:01.333
- No, it's not. It's not.
- Well, what is it?

01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:04.374
Are you just gifting me to him
like you did his wife?

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:07.089
- It's not the same as that.
- Well, how is it different?

01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:09.720
His wife had a choice to make.
First she came to you.

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:11.598
- You said, "No, choose him."
- Oh, stop it.

01:24:11.755 --> 01:24:13.177
- And so she did.
- Diana, stop...

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:14.762
How's it different?

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:19.972
That true?

01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:22.436
What she just said?

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:45.543
Just like that, everything.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:50.469
Look, Paddy...

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:53.426
Paddy.

01:24:59.553 --> 01:25:01.180
Oh, my God.

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:06.064
I am so sorry.

01:25:10.564 --> 01:25:14.239
No, it's not your fault.
It's, you know...

01:25:16.903 --> 01:25:19.076
He's my best friend, you know?

01:25:38.842 --> 01:25:40.435
And these four guys...

01:25:54.775 --> 01:25:56.527
Paddy, you okay?

01:25:57.527 --> 01:25:58.949
Paddy, what's wrong?

01:25:59.112 --> 01:26:00.534
What happened?

01:26:01.448 --> 01:26:02.825
Paddy?

01:27:22.612 --> 01:27:24.660
We were kids, Paddy.

01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:28.957
You don't know women.

01:27:29.619 --> 01:27:30.871
What are you talking about?

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:33.423
Look, Billy, you don't know women
the way I know them.

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:35.880
You haven't shared
a full life with anyone.

01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:37.965
You don't know what that is.

01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:41.264
You can't tell a woman who to love.

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:44.347
Especially Sophie. You can't do it.

01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:47.346
I know what I had with my wife, Billy.

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:48.855
Thanks to you.

01:27:49.014 --> 01:27:52.735
So I'm gonna ask you one more time,
you miserable prick.

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:54.019
One more time.

01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:57.360
Do you love this woman
you are about to marry?

01:27:57.522 --> 01:27:59.149
Billy!

01:28:01.777 --> 01:28:05.122
All right, here's the deal:
You end it, or I will.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:08.875
Hey, hey, you stay out of this, all right?
It has nothing to do with you.

01:28:12.746 --> 01:28:14.214
Hey, babe!

01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:17.547
I owe you this one.

01:28:22.506 --> 01:28:25.851
Lisa, my name's Patrick Connors.
Although that imbecile in the pool there

01:28:26.009 --> 01:28:28.210
started calling me Paddy
when we were kids and it stuck.

01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:30.385
Oh, right. Paddy!
It's so great to finally meet you.

01:28:30.514 --> 01:28:32.554
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
- Billy's told me so much.

01:28:32.682 --> 01:28:34.043
Why did you throw him in the pool?

01:28:34.184 --> 01:28:36.152
That's just an old game
from the neighborhood.

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:38.188
Listen, dear.
Can I tell you something?

01:28:38.355 --> 01:28:40.323
- Yeah.
- Fifty years ago,

01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:42.576
Billy did something for me

01:28:42.734 --> 01:28:45.613
that allowed me to marry
the only woman I ever loved.

01:28:45.779 --> 01:28:47.702
And now it's my chance
to return the favor.

01:28:48.865 --> 01:28:52.165
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- He's not in love with you.

01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:55.164
He likes you.
I know he likes you a whole lot,

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:58.174
but he doesn't love you
like the way that he should.

01:28:58.792 --> 01:29:00.169
I can't let him marry you.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:02.838
He's my best friend.
I can't let him marry you.

01:29:06.299 --> 01:29:07.346
Billy?

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:11.146
I guess we gotta talk, huh?

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:14.520
What is he saying to her?

01:29:14.891 --> 01:29:17.861
That she's young,
got her whole life ahead of her.

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:21.068
Trying as best he can
to let her down easy.

01:29:21.231 --> 01:29:22.733
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your names.

01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:24.651
- Madison.
- Taylor.

01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:26.195
Madison.

01:29:28.113 --> 01:29:30.832
How do you think she's taking it?

01:29:35.662 --> 01:29:36.834
Mixed emotions.

01:29:37.789 --> 01:29:41.009
- This blows.
- Yeah. Blows.

01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:47.382
This is gonna be one
sloppy, drunken weekend.

01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:49.017
Yeah. Bye, Taylor.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:51.845
Bye, Madisons.

01:30:14.367 --> 01:30:15.414
Hey, Billy?

01:30:16.536 --> 01:30:17.753
Yeah?

01:30:18.997 --> 01:30:20.624
I couldn't let you marry her.

01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:25.846
No, you did it right. You...
Congratulations, a good job.

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:30.930
- You mad?
- No. No, you were right.

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.513
Because, you know,
if you're mad that's okay.

01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:37.523
No, Paddy. I... I'm old.

01:30:38.183 --> 01:30:39.685
You know?

01:30:39.893 --> 01:30:42.362
And without her...

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.739
I'm just scared of being old.

01:30:48.777 --> 01:30:51.951
We were 17, you know,
five minutes ago.

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:55.287
It was just yesterday. I just don't know
where it all went, you know?

01:30:56.618 --> 01:31:01.670
My brain cannot conceive
how old this body is.

01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:06.678
Our girl's gone, Pat.

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:10.341
And I wasn't there at the funeral.

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:13.594
And I'm so sorry about that.

01:31:15.428 --> 01:31:17.851
I let you down, man.

01:31:18.932 --> 01:31:21.560
And I couldn't bring myself
to say goodbye.

01:31:22.644 --> 01:31:27.150
Archie's got a stroke, and Sam, well,
he's gone to Florida.

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:30.114
Man, it's just winding up
a little too fast.

01:31:30.276 --> 01:31:34.076
And I'm feeling old and alone.

01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:39.123
You have us.

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:42.710
Yeah, Billy.

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:45.133
God help you, you got us.

01:31:47.919 --> 01:31:49.999
And you got a hot little number
singing her heart out

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:52.679
in some shithole across town,
you lucky son of a bitch.

01:32:02.225 --> 01:32:03.693
Man.

01:32:06.896 --> 01:32:09.274
<i>Only you</i>

01:32:11.901 --> 01:32:17.954
<i>Only you can make this
Change in me</i>

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.203
<i>For it's true</i>

01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:26.462
<i>Oh, baby, you're my</i>

01:32:27.667 --> 01:32:30.136
<i>Destiny</i>

01:32:30.837 --> 01:32:34.762
<i>When you hold my hand</i>

01:32:42.724 --> 01:32:44.601
Is she sick?

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.187
That's it?
You're not gonna finish?

01:32:47.353 --> 01:32:50.402
Shush. You got in for free.

01:32:54.277 --> 01:32:57.827
So how did she take it?

01:32:57.989 --> 01:33:01.118
Well, she's probably
in Malibu by now

01:33:01.284 --> 01:33:03.537
burning my house down, you know?

01:33:03.703 --> 01:33:06.252
It went as well as you could expect.

01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:09.254
Poor kid. Are those for me?

01:33:11.628 --> 01:33:13.847
Actually, no.

01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:16.974
I'm sorry...

01:33:17.717 --> 01:33:19.060
Excuse me.

01:33:20.845 --> 01:33:23.519
On behalf of Binion's,
I'd like to apologize

01:33:23.681 --> 01:33:25.979
for the delay in the show...

01:33:28.353 --> 01:33:30.856
but I'm really interested
in the performer.

01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:35.701
She's the most amazing woman
I ever met,

01:33:36.528 --> 01:33:41.329
and I just can't believe in two days
that she's, you know, inside my heart.

01:33:43.535 --> 01:33:46.163
But I don't want her to know,

01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:48.331
because, you know,
with gorgeous women,

01:33:48.498 --> 01:33:51.001
they like men
that like to play hard-to-get.

01:33:51.376 --> 01:33:53.879
True. Very true.

01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:56.594
Thank you.

01:34:01.803 --> 01:34:03.146
Okay, that worked.

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:07.980
So you gonna kiss me now,

01:34:08.143 --> 01:34:10.896
or you want to hear more about
how I'm falling for you?

01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:14.365
Eye contact. You...

01:34:14.941 --> 01:34:17.615
it doesn't mean anything
without eye contact.

01:34:28.788 --> 01:34:31.086
I'm looking at you, baby.

01:34:47.265 --> 01:34:49.609
All right, kid, we'll take it from here.

01:34:50.602 --> 01:34:52.980
Time you went and hung out
with some guys your own age.

01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:56.654
And here's a little something
for your troubles.

01:34:57.984 --> 01:35:00.703
- Wow, you sure?
- No, I was just putting you on.

01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:03.536
- Of course I'm sure.
- You give the best advice.

01:35:06.159 --> 01:35:07.911
You breathe a word
about us to the feds,

01:35:08.077 --> 01:35:10.045
we will hunt you down.

01:35:19.005 --> 01:35:20.928
My lips are sealed, Mr. Accountant.

01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:22.637
Let me get your bag.

01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:26.980
- Boys! What's up, fellas?
- Lonnie-boy!

01:35:27.138 --> 01:35:28.640
- Hey.
- All right, you ready to go?

01:35:28.806 --> 01:35:30.023
Packed? You got everything?

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:31.938
Let me get this off my chest.

01:35:32.101 --> 01:35:34.945
I've hosted superstars,
I've hosted billionaires,

01:35:35.104 --> 01:35:37.448
I've hosted kings,
and they ain't got nothing...

01:35:37.607 --> 01:35:41.237
I said they have nothing
on the Flatbush Four, you hear me?

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:43.245
Nothing. And I remember,

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:46.374
I heard this beautiful quote.
It was...

01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:52.039
"Ain't nothing in this world
that's deeper than loyalty and love,

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:55.333
except for loyalty and love
between thugs."

01:35:58.169 --> 01:36:00.092
Fifty-Cent, man! Fifty!

01:36:00.255 --> 01:36:02.849
Hey, Lonnie, get a limo
for our buddy here and take him

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:04.568
out to the airport to meet his friends.

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:06.970
Thank you. Great party.

01:36:07.762 --> 01:36:09.402
- Let's go, wise guy, come on.
- Let's go.

01:36:09.555 --> 01:36:11.023
Okay, gentlemen.

01:36:11.891 --> 01:36:13.518
Who wants a drink?

01:36:13.685 --> 01:36:14.732
Drink?

01:36:14.894 --> 01:36:16.862
Oh, man, where the hell
did you find that?

01:36:17.021 --> 01:36:19.524
- Found it in the garbage.
- Crack that puppy open, buddy.

01:36:19.691 --> 01:36:20.988
It's about time.

01:36:21.859 --> 01:36:23.702
Perfect, yeah. Okay.

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:29.997
Okay, so

01:36:30.576 --> 01:36:33.170
here's to being invincible.

01:36:33.329 --> 01:36:34.546
Invincible.

01:36:35.373 --> 01:36:37.922
- Invincible.
- Invincible.

01:36:43.589 --> 01:36:45.182
- Jeez.
- Terrible!

01:36:45.341 --> 01:36:47.014
- Water.
- I gotta go brush my teeth.

01:36:48.261 --> 01:36:50.434
It can't go bad. It's Scotch.

01:36:50.596 --> 01:36:52.064
It's not so bad.

01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:09.115
All right, Paddy,
I think you and I go in

01:37:09.282 --> 01:37:11.410
and... that way.

01:37:11.576 --> 01:37:13.203
Sam, you go in and that way.

01:37:13.369 --> 01:37:15.713
And I go that way.

01:37:15.872 --> 01:37:17.715
- Okay-
- Okay-

01:37:19.459 --> 01:37:22.212
So hell of a weekend.

01:37:22.378 --> 01:37:24.597
Yeah. Yeah.

01:37:24.756 --> 01:37:26.599
That's for sure.

01:37:26.758 --> 01:37:27.805
- You think?
- Yeah.

01:37:27.967 --> 01:37:29.435
Yeah, next year...

01:37:30.803 --> 01:37:31.850
Disney World.

01:37:33.097 --> 01:37:34.849
Myrtle Beach.

01:37:36.225 --> 01:37:38.068
- Poconos.
- The Poconos.

01:37:38.227 --> 01:37:39.604
Yeah, that's supposed to be nice.

01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:41.819
- Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?

01:37:41.981 --> 01:37:43.153
But it's gotta be summer.

01:37:43.316 --> 01:37:45.990
Kayaking in Norway.

01:37:46.152 --> 01:37:48.826
Or the Orient Express.

01:37:48.988 --> 01:37:52.288
We could take a barge
through the canals of...

01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:55.203
- France.
- France, Europe, Germany.

01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:58.624
You guys are the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:37:58.831 --> 01:38:00.424
Yeah.

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:03.086
I don't care how ugly you are.

01:38:06.756 --> 01:38:10.101
- Sixty years.
- Yeah.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.392
Yeah.

01:38:23.064 --> 01:38:24.111
Okay.

01:38:25.525 --> 01:38:26.777
Okay.

01:38:28.528 --> 01:38:31.873
- Okay-
- Okay-

01:38:44.836 --> 01:38:47.259
Hey! Wrong way.

01:39:12.321 --> 01:39:13.664
Hang on.

01:39:14.490 --> 01:39:18.245
- Hello?
- Archibald, I got some news.

01:39:18.411 --> 01:39:21.631
- Is it the prostate?
- No, man, it's not my prostate.

01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:24.212
What's it with you and always
about the prostate, you know?

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:26.673
Wait a minute, let me patch in
the other guys, huh?

01:39:26.836 --> 01:39:29.635
- I got that good cheese from France.
- Good.

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:31.219
And a bottle of wine?

01:39:40.975 --> 01:39:43.979
- Hello?
- Hey, Paddy, it's Billy and Archie.

01:39:44.145 --> 01:39:46.568
- Why is the phone ringing?
- Sam's not picking up.

01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:51.326
<i>So, guys, you ready for this?</i>

01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:55.577
Diana and I are gonna get married.

01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:58.542
She's making a huge mistake.

01:39:58.701 --> 01:40:00.141
He says you're making
a huge mistake.

01:40:00.286 --> 01:40:02.459
Yeah, tell him I know.
I know, Paddy.

01:40:02.622 --> 01:40:04.875
What about the five trips
to the toilet every night?

01:40:05.041 --> 01:40:07.260
- I know it all.
