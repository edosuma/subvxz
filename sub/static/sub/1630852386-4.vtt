WEBVTT

00:11.011 --> 00:13.680
<i>Thanks for letting me</i>
<i>explain myself, Camille.</i>

00:14.222 --> 00:17.684
<i>What happened with Gabriel was stupid.</i>

00:18.226 --> 00:22.731
It was a goodbye kiss that turned
into something that it shouldn't have.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.607
I'm sorry for hurting you and--

00:25.525 --> 00:26.359
What?

00:27.277 --> 00:28.319
I didn't say anything.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.780
You were clenching your jaw!
I heard it pop.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.575
Well, it's just the more you say,
the worse it sounds.

00:33.658 --> 00:36.411
-So I should say less?
-Or nothing at all.

00:36.494 --> 00:39.539
Uh, she put
an omelette pan in our toilet, Em.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.583
Which is why I have to talk to her.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.294
-I need to explain myself.
-And beg for forgiveness?

00:45.045 --> 00:47.714
Look, I think
most girls would forgive you,

00:47.797 --> 00:49.549
but a French girl, nuh-uh.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.093
You're right.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.054
Why don't you come
to the drag club tonight

00:54.137 --> 00:55.638
and drink away your guilt?

00:55.722 --> 00:57.807
-I wish I could, but I have French class.
-Oh.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.642
Yeah, I'm levelling up to French II.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.103
And I have to focus,
because I need more oral.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.646
I don't think that's your issue.

01:04.355 --> 01:07.650
You can consummate
in French, just not conjugate.

01:07.734 --> 01:08.860


01:08.943 --> 01:11.029


01:19.412 --> 01:21.122
More to the left?

01:22.415 --> 01:25.293
No, but I mean
if you could just align it with the shelf?

01:27.587 --> 01:30.799
You know what? Put it back
to where you had it. Sorry.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.425
<i>Bonjour!</i>

01:32.509 --> 01:34.761
Oh, good morning, Emily.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.847
Who puts their initials on a pan?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.057
That was a gift.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.018
And it's brought me nothing
but bad luck, so I'm returning it.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.729
I don't want it,
and I don't want anything from you, okay?

01:44.813 --> 01:47.398
-This is just such a huge mess.
-I know.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.527
And I'm sorry. I really am.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.447
-Have you seen Camille?
-No, have you?

01:54.531 --> 01:57.450
No. I'm staying out of her way.
I have a re-opening to focus on.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.744
Hmm, I wish I could hide from her too,

01:59.828 --> 02:02.705
but today she's coming in to Savoir
for a Champère meeting.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.124
I'm not hiding.

02:05.667 --> 02:06.668
Call it what you want.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.920
You'd better wash it this time.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.463
With soap and water.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.840
Mindy almost peed on it!

02:20.473 --> 02:21.474


02:24.644 --> 02:26.271
Camille is here.

02:26.354 --> 02:29.274
Maybe it's better
if I do the presentation, no?

02:29.899 --> 02:34.195
-Oh. How does she seem?
-You know, she's…

02:34.279 --> 02:36.322
I heard all about
your dramatic dinner party.

02:36.406 --> 02:40.952
I'm so sorry I missed it.
The dinner and the show.

02:43.746 --> 02:46.040
I have
a new show at the gallery.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.084
It's very provocative.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.085
I should come by.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.795
<i>Bonjour.</i> Sorry, I'm late.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.631
Let me know.
There's some pieces I think you'd like.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.551
I'll do that. Thanks, Camille.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.970
Okay, let's get started.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.973
Traffic was terrible this morning.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.142
I had to ride my bike
along Rue Saint-Honoré and--

03:04.225 --> 03:07.687
I'll say it again. I don't care
how you get to work, Luc.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.981
It's like he owns a bike to talk about it.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.193
Ow!

03:13.276 --> 03:15.653
Oh, I'm sorry,
did that hit your face?

03:15.737 --> 03:18.531
Okay, right, well,
we've gotten great feedback

03:18.615 --> 03:20.200
from our focus group on Champère.

03:20.283 --> 03:24.204
I'm sorry. If it's okay with you,
I would be more comfortable

03:24.287 --> 03:26.247
conducting our business in French.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.917
There are nuances
about my family's company

03:29.000 --> 03:31.628
that cannot be discussed
in English, I'm afraid.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.757
By all means! I mean,
we're a French company, after all.

03:38.801 --> 03:41.179
<i>Oui. Très bien.</i>

03:41.930 --> 03:44.641
Well, uh, Champère…

03:44.724 --> 03:48.144
<i>est très fantastique.</i>

03:48.228 --> 03:51.314
<i>Et très bien!</i>

03:53.358 --> 03:56.778
As Emily was saying,
we were pleasantly surprised

03:56.861 --> 03:59.155
by feedback from the focus group…

03:59.239 --> 04:03.576
Feedback is excellent,
especially regarding packaging…

04:06.996 --> 04:11.125
Camille,
can we have lunch, or a drink?

04:11.209 --> 04:13.294
I'd really love to explain myself.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.551
<i>Répétez, s'il vous plait?</i>

04:24.722 --> 04:28.101
She said, "It doesn't matter
what language you're speaking,

04:28.184 --> 04:30.478
I don't believe a word
coming out of your mouth."

04:30.561 --> 04:32.939
Oh. That's not good.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.984
What would you suggest that I do?

04:37.068 --> 04:39.028
Learn French. For starters.

04:50.164 --> 04:54.377
No, no, no! Emily,
you're over here! Back with me again.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.088
Oh, I thought that I was moving up
to Madam LeFrak, Level 2.

04:57.171 --> 05:00.300
-Oh, no, your classmates are. You're not.
-I'm not?

05:01.217 --> 05:04.846
But why? I've never been held back.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.347
For anything.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.392
There's a first time for everything.

05:15.690 --> 05:20.570
Hi, everyone, welcome, new and old faces.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.781
Before you sit,
choose a partner to work with.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.617
Remember, this is
a French immersion course,

05:26.701 --> 05:31.080
so both of you must exclusively
speak French in and out of class.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.041
This is the only way you'll improve.

05:34.709 --> 05:35.626
<i>Bonjour.</i>

05:36.669 --> 05:38.338
I'm Emily.

05:38.421 --> 05:42.216
I'm from Chicago. Where are you from?

05:43.259 --> 05:45.261
Alfie. London.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.063
<i>Bonjour.</i>

05:55.146 --> 05:56.856
I'm Emily.

05:56.939 --> 06:00.485
I'm from Chicago. Where are you from?

06:01.611 --> 06:02.737
<i>Bonjour.</i>

06:02.820 --> 06:06.532
I'm Petra. I'm from Kyiv.

06:06.616 --> 06:11.079
-Oh, nice to meet you, Petra.
-Uh…

06:11.162 --> 06:13.581
<i>Enchantée. S'il vous plait.</i>

06:17.085 --> 06:18.336
<i>Bien.</i>

06:29.055 --> 06:32.183
See, Benoît, here she is.

06:32.266 --> 06:36.854
The most overqualified <i>dame pipi</i>
in all of Paris.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.356
Oh, stop! But keep going.

06:38.439 --> 06:41.818
Okay, you were incredible.
And we might have a job for you.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.319
Yes, I'll perform at your wedding.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.571
Or officiate it,
which pays more? I'll do both!

06:45.655 --> 06:47.115
-Nothing like that.

06:47.198 --> 06:51.411
We are a band,
and actually, we need a singer.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.997
And we play at some pretty cool spots.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.207
Oh.

06:56.290 --> 06:59.335
Wow, that's so flattering, <i>merci.</i>

06:59.419 --> 07:03.047
I wish I could, but right now
I need to prioritize my finances.

07:03.131 --> 07:06.300
I owe my housemate
about 200 oat milk lattes.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.386
Is that all you're getting here?

07:09.011 --> 07:12.181
Yeah, but I can have
as many mints as I want.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.307
Come on.

07:13.391 --> 07:16.310
Talent like yours
is worth a lot more than that.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.728
Oh.

07:17.812 --> 07:24.694
I appreciate that, but the problem is,
my work visa isn't really working.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.112
Where are you from?

07:26.195 --> 07:29.407
Oh, well, I'm a citizen of the world,
but my passport's Chinese.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.034
My mother is Korean,
and my dad's from Shanghai.

07:32.118 --> 07:36.414
-I'm from Shanghai too!
-Ah, that's why you're so stylish!

07:37.415 --> 07:39.667
Look, you don't need
a work visa to sing with us.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.835
-What?
-Yeah.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.712
Okay, tell me more. Mint?

07:49.469 --> 07:52.513
Camille liked the idea
of a celebrity brand ambassador.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.349
What actress wants
to be sprayed with Champère?

07:55.433 --> 07:56.976
-A porn actress!
-Luc!

07:57.059 --> 07:59.312
Are you talking
about Champère?

07:59.395 --> 08:03.483
<i>Oui.</i> Camille gave us notes
on your forward-planning presentation.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.151
Why wasn't I cc'd on that email?

08:05.234 --> 08:08.362
There was no cc.
It was a call.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.364
-When?
-Does it even matter?

08:10.448 --> 08:13.618
I mean, Google Translate wouldn't
have kept up with the conversation.

08:14.285 --> 08:18.414
I'm trying to learn French as quickly
as possible, but until I'm fluent,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.666
can we please discuss
my accounts in English?

08:20.750 --> 08:24.378
If Camille wants to conduct
her business in French, we must abide.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.338
She's the client!

08:25.421 --> 08:27.423
-And we're a client service agency.
-But--

08:27.507 --> 08:29.342
Can't talk your way out of this.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.427
You don't have the <i>vocabulaire.</i>

08:32.595 --> 08:36.182
Maybe I need a private tutor
to help speed along my French.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.227
Why don't I take you
to a classic French film tonight?

08:39.310 --> 08:42.605
-Perfect for learning our language.
-I would love that!

08:42.688 --> 08:43.898
I'll check.

08:44.565 --> 08:47.193
-Uh, the <i>poireau</i> people are here.
-What?

08:48.194 --> 08:51.239
-I thought we cancelled!
-I tried, but they were very persistent.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.323
<i>Poireau?</i>

08:52.406 --> 08:56.118
Oh, um, I don't know that brand.
Are they leather goods?

08:56.202 --> 08:57.870
A <i>poireau</i> is a leek.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.498
Yes, and Savoir
doesn't market root vegetables.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.999
Can they even afford our fees?

09:02.083 --> 09:05.211
Well, the leek lobby
is very powerful in France.

09:07.004 --> 09:10.174
Okay, Emily,
after mishandling Pierre Cadault

09:10.258 --> 09:13.094
and compromising Champère
with your poor choices,

09:13.177 --> 09:17.181
the leek could be your chance
to redeem yourself. <i>Courage.</i>

09:20.309 --> 09:22.937
It shouldn't be called the humble leek.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.106
It's so much more than that.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.985
-Yes. Complex. Mysterious.
-Hmm.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.236
Versatile.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.862
Mmm.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.699
Sweet, but earthy.

09:34.782 --> 09:39.954
It's a beloved French staple
that deserves international recognition.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.373
Well, then let's give it a makeover.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.959
Lobsters were considered
the cockroaches of the sea

09:45.042 --> 09:46.836
until they were marketed as a delicacy.

09:46.919 --> 09:50.548
Precisely.
And, as an American, you're perfect.

09:50.631 --> 09:53.843
We'd love a rebrand that boosts
our market share in the States,

09:53.926 --> 09:57.805
and we think, with your help,
we could be the next Brussels sprouts.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.808
-I hate Brussels sprouts.
-So do I.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.393
Bitter little balls of cabbage

10:02.476 --> 10:05.730
that need to be roasted
in liters of olive oil to be edible.

10:05.813 --> 10:09.317
Hold the Brussels sprouts,
I'll have a potato leek soup.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.069
-No potato.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.614
Why do people
always toss in a dirty old potato?

10:14.697 --> 10:16.324
Serge! Breathe.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.547
What do you think of the new color?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.341
What was it before?

10:33.424 --> 10:34.675
It was the same.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.510
I'm painting it back to what it was.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.972
So I guess I should call it the old color.

10:40.681 --> 10:41.849
Are you okay?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.185
Uh, I'm not sleeping very well.

10:44.268 --> 10:47.313
I'm having trouble
making decisions and, uh…

10:48.606 --> 10:52.068
Right now everybody around here
really needs me to make decisions.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.530
-Leek tart for dinner?
-What?

10:57.365 --> 11:01.952
Oh, they're for inspiration.
I'm planning on marketing them to the US.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.538
You know, leek is not
an American vegetable

11:04.622 --> 11:09.335
that hits you over the head
with flavor. It's subtle. Elusive.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.755
-So misunderstood.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.883
What? Don't laugh at the leek!

11:16.967 --> 11:18.928
Okay, let me show you.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.847
I'm not sure
we should be spending time together.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.850
And, plus, you seem pretty busy.

11:24.934 --> 11:28.688
Please, I need a break
from not making any decisions.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.398
Leeks have a transformational quality.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.358
You can't rush them.

12:15.317 --> 12:18.237
You have to coax the flavor out.
A good reminder is…

12:18.863 --> 12:21.949
Keep the heat low and take it slow.
Can you do that?

12:22.032 --> 12:24.660
I'm a very patient person.

12:24.744 --> 12:28.539
I see you running around
with your Starbucks, rushing all the time.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.046
-Oh, wow.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.257
-These are really amazing.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.092
I was watching the entire time,

12:40.176 --> 12:42.470
and I still don't understand
how you did that.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.269
Does this make sense to you?

12:51.604 --> 12:52.772
No.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.940
I think it's Cyrillic.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.567
-

12:56.650 --> 13:00.029
Oh, it's Petra from French class.
I forgot we were getting coffee together.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.615
-Like I said…
-Sorry.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.160
So how was your meeting with Camille?

13:06.994 --> 13:08.329
Uh…

13:08.412 --> 13:10.956
Well, she refused to talk to me.

13:11.040 --> 13:15.586
And now she's icing me out
of her life and her account, so not well.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.463
So maybe just leave it alone then.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.840
I'm not a leek, Gabriel.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.343
I'm a girl from Chicago. Okay?

13:22.426 --> 13:23.928
I can't just magically transform

13:24.011 --> 13:27.223
into someone who can sleep
with a friend's boyfriend and not care.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.935
Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.
I wish there was something I could do.

13:31.769 --> 13:32.853
There is.

13:33.604 --> 13:34.939
What?

13:35.022 --> 13:38.609
You could tell her that what happened
between us didn't mean anything.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.905
I'm not sure I can do that.
I'd be lying to her.

13:44.448 --> 13:45.449
Then lie.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.585
Ah! Uh…

13:56.669 --> 13:59.380
You smell.
I like pretty smell.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.131
Oh! <i>Merci!</i>

14:01.215 --> 14:02.925
It's De L'Heure.

14:03.008 --> 14:06.512
They my marketing client.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.974
Uh… I can smell for free.

14:11.016 --> 14:11.976
Free?

14:12.601 --> 14:14.854
I no pay.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.233
I love free! Um…

14:20.568 --> 14:23.070
We clothes shop now?

14:23.153 --> 14:25.948
I love to do shopping!

14:27.074 --> 14:28.492
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.795
<i>J'adore!</i>

14:42.673 --> 14:44.425
Hmm? Yeah.

14:45.634 --> 14:46.677
Oh, yeah!

14:48.512 --> 14:49.638
<i>Joli!</i>

14:54.810 --> 14:56.186
Uh…

14:56.270 --> 15:00.149
That is beautiful hat for head.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.944
Thanks. Chic jacket, yes?

15:04.028 --> 15:08.949
<i>Oui.</i> Uh, very. So chic. So jacket.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.037
Emily!

15:14.371 --> 15:16.498
Beautiful Baguette. Adore.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.542
Oh, <i>oui.</i>

15:18.626 --> 15:22.755
Yes, baguette very beautiful.
But money big.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.466
I love free, no?

15:25.549 --> 15:26.842
Yes, I love free!

15:26.926 --> 15:28.469
<i>-Oui.</i>
<i>-Oui.</i>

15:35.893 --> 15:37.895
But wait! We didn't pay!

15:39.021 --> 15:40.814
Run!

15:44.860 --> 15:48.322
Wait! Come back!
Come back, we can't steal this stuff.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.865
We have to go back!

15:49.949 --> 15:51.116
Huh?

15:52.201 --> 15:55.788
We bad. Take clothes back.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.840
I'm to store.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.263
Oh, no! Oh, no!

16:14.264 --> 16:17.184
Don't you know
what happens to Jean Valjean

16:17.267 --> 16:18.644
when he stole the baguette?

16:18.727 --> 16:21.397
Have you ever seen <i>Les Mis?</i>

16:47.798 --> 16:49.341
What are you doing here?

16:49.425 --> 16:52.136
I've texted, called, been
to your apartment. I had to see you.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.805
-You've seen me. Now leave.
-Not until we talk.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.523
So? Talk. I have art to sell.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.276
I'm so sorry, Camille.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.613
But what happened
wasn't Emily's fault. It was mine.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.784
-Did you come here to defend her?
-No, I'm the one to blame here.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.871
-It's not fair that she's being punished.
-Give Emily some credit.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.415
It's not like she tripped over
and landed on your dick.

17:21.999 --> 17:22.958
Look,

17:24.168 --> 17:25.252
I love you.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.838
I love you. We all love each other…

17:27.921 --> 17:30.466
So a ménage à trois
is your solution to all our problems?

17:30.549 --> 17:32.843
-That's not what I'm saying.
-Then what are you saying?

17:38.557 --> 17:41.477
I want you to know
that this is hurting me too.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.895
And that I still love you.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.981
I want us to all get along.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.445
Your hopeless romantic act
was charming five years ago.

17:53.405 --> 17:54.531
It's time to grow up.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.602
Ah, what a beautiful cinema!

18:23.685 --> 18:27.314
Paris is filled with them.
It's the cinema capital of the world.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.735
But Le Champo was
the director François Truffaut's favorite.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.070
I can see why.

18:34.113 --> 18:38.784
There's no better place to learn French
and see one of his most famous films.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.702
<i>Jules and Jim.</i> Let's go.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.664
Oh, should we share a popcorn?

18:44.456 --> 18:45.415
Why not?

18:46.041 --> 18:46.875
Thank you.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.313
<i>Monsieur Jim,</i>

19:08.397 --> 19:12.442
<i>would you come help me</i>
<i>take my bags to the station tomorrow?</i>

19:14.528 --> 19:18.365
<i>While Jim reads downstairs,</i>
<i>she took Jules into her room.</i>

19:26.582 --> 19:30.127
You took me to a movie
about a ménage à trois? Really, Luc?

19:30.919 --> 19:32.045
You can relate, no?

19:36.175 --> 19:38.427
<i>I'm late. See you later.</i>

19:42.764 --> 19:44.057
<i>I love you, Jim.</i>

19:44.141 --> 19:48.312
<i>So many unbelievable things</i>
<i>we can't understand turn out to be true.</i>

19:48.395 --> 19:50.189
What is happening?

19:51.398 --> 19:54.234
Catherine is reading a love letter to Jim.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.111
She's pregnant with his baby.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.239
And she's begging
for him to take her back.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.783
-Oh, I thought she was a ghost.

20:08.165 --> 20:12.044
Did we have to see them cremated
and their bones crushed to dust?

20:13.462 --> 20:17.674
Of course. It's beautiful.
Their love is eternal.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.595
It killed them. It was a tragedy.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.889
<i>Oui.</i> A cautionary tale.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.850
-Did you like it?
-I did.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.312
But parts of it were so frustrating.

20:30.395 --> 20:33.649
If Catherine and Jim had only waited
for each other's letters to arrive

20:33.732 --> 20:35.234
before sending another one,

20:35.317 --> 20:38.904
there would have been less confusion
and they all could have ended up together.

20:44.618 --> 20:47.454
Bad text? Aren't they all?

20:48.288 --> 20:50.916
So direct. Tone deaf.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.210
Letters are more personal.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.295
It's not easy to speak our feelings,

20:55.379 --> 20:58.840
but it's easier to write them
on paper and be understood.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.886
Let's have a drink.

21:15.065 --> 21:19.194
How are you going to write
an apology letter to Camille in French?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.570
How hard can it be?

21:21.446 --> 21:22.531
Hold that thought.

21:24.408 --> 21:28.870
I've been meaning to tell you,
you've been using dog shampoo, sis.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.580
What? Really?

21:30.664 --> 21:33.625
Well, I can't understand the label.
How was I meant to know?

21:33.709 --> 21:35.544
Well, there's a dog on the bottle.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.213
There's a woman holding the dog.
She has shiny hair!

21:38.297 --> 21:40.882
-So does the dog!

21:41.717 --> 21:44.261
I'm really going to need
your help with that letter.

21:44.344 --> 21:47.431
I can't today, sorry.
I have my first gig with the band.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.598
Already?

21:49.391 --> 21:52.352
Crazy, right?
We rehearsed all day yesterday.

21:52.436 --> 21:56.857
They're a little pop, a little jazz,
and a lot of gay. I love them.

21:56.940 --> 22:00.319
Wow! From <i>la dame pipi</i> to scat queen.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.529
Let's not go with that.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.992
I'm just glad
I'll finally be able to pay you back.

22:07.075 --> 22:08.994
Or at least buy you some human shampoo.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.412
Oh, get out of here!

22:10.495 --> 22:13.290
Bye, bitch.
Hey, good luck with that letter.

22:31.850 --> 22:32.768
Julien?

22:33.810 --> 22:36.021
What's "I didn't know
he was your boyfriend

22:36.104 --> 22:37.522
when I kissed him" in French?

22:37.606 --> 22:40.067
Mmm-hmm. And what about
when you slept with him?

22:41.026 --> 22:42.819
Okay, just google it, Emily.

22:49.951 --> 22:53.413
Oh, uh, Sylvie, do you mind
if I ask you a language question?

22:53.497 --> 22:55.916
Well, if you must.

22:55.999 --> 23:00.170
Is, "I am sad
that I am naughty"

23:00.253 --> 23:01.671
grammatically correct?

23:01.755 --> 23:04.549
It's definitely in your voice.

23:04.633 --> 23:05.801
What's this for?

23:06.635 --> 23:10.055
Oh, just homework for French class.
We're practicing letter-writing.

23:10.138 --> 23:11.932
Oh, how provincial.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.352
Oh, that reminds me,
those onion-breath <i>ploucs</i>

23:15.435 --> 23:18.688
from the leek lobby
want to hear your idea today.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.190
Um, yeah, it's almost ready.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.358
<i>Très bien.</i>

23:21.942 --> 23:24.778
Oh, as impressive
as your French is getting,

23:24.861 --> 23:26.738
they value your Americanness.

23:26.822 --> 23:29.825
So I suggest you present in English.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.035
<i>D'accord.</i>

23:45.715 --> 23:48.009
Hey, Mindy! Over here!

23:59.438 --> 24:00.981
Is the gig here?

24:01.064 --> 24:03.358
<i>Oui,</i> gorgeous spot, huh?

24:03.442 --> 24:04.776
Beats the <i>toilettes.</i>

24:04.860 --> 24:07.028
Are we part of an outdoor music festival?

24:07.112 --> 24:09.698
Don't worry, the acoustics
are better than you'd expect.

24:09.781 --> 24:12.909
And we get
great reverberation off the fountain.

24:15.662 --> 24:16.705
Why did you…

24:18.790 --> 24:21.543
Wait, are we busking?

24:30.677 --> 24:32.637
I received this for you.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.805
<i>Merci,</i> Peter.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.110
<i>Chère</i> Camille.

24:47.194 --> 24:51.072
I'm very sorry you hurt.

24:52.073 --> 24:55.869
You welcome me to Paris,

24:56.536 --> 24:59.539
I'm happy for your friend.

25:00.373 --> 25:02.792
Do you believe I miss me?

25:03.835 --> 25:06.755
I like you most, daughter.

25:08.048 --> 25:12.802
I am sad that I am naughty.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.932
I forgive your lost heart.

25:18.099 --> 25:20.727
I very need you

25:20.810 --> 25:26.066
to talk and hear, please.

25:27.025 --> 25:30.737
Love forever, Emily.

25:40.705 --> 25:44.668
And the tag line is "Le Leek c'est Chic!"

25:48.463 --> 25:51.299
Or what about, "Oh, La, La, Les Leeks"?

25:52.676 --> 25:55.011
Or, "Leek Your Nudes."

25:55.095 --> 25:58.974
The model is naked,
lower half covered in leeks,

25:59.057 --> 26:01.017
and for the upper half,

26:02.394 --> 26:03.603
she holds

26:05.188 --> 26:06.439
two potatoes.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.817
-No potatoes!
-No, potatoes…

26:08.900 --> 26:11.194
-Potatoes…
-It's not just the tag line.

26:11.278 --> 26:15.198
The whole thing
feels like a little cliché.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.825
Yeah, no, I agree.

26:16.908 --> 26:20.620
I mean, if you want to attract Americans,
why not just give them magic leek soup?

26:20.704 --> 26:23.039
-Oh.
-What's magic leek soup?

26:23.123 --> 26:25.083
Leeks are a diet food for French women.

26:25.875 --> 26:30.088
We boil them and drink the water.
It's our magic trick. Our little secret.

26:30.171 --> 26:31.715
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

26:31.798 --> 26:33.800
Then it wouldn't be a secret, would it?

26:33.883 --> 26:36.219
I don't think that
there's a magic way to lose weight.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.972
That sounds like something
Gwyneth would push on Goop.

26:39.055 --> 26:41.641
Oh! You can get us on Goop?

26:41.725 --> 26:43.476
Oh, let's do that. Please!

26:43.727 --> 26:46.396
-What's Goop?
-The thing with the American actress…

26:46.479 --> 26:47.897
Have you heard of this?

26:47.981 --> 26:50.317
Of course. It's a common drink
that helps shed kilos.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.069
What? That sounds so bad for you.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.821
Yes, but it's perfect for America.

26:54.904 --> 26:58.533
I just don't think that
we should be promoting weight loss cures.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.285
Fad diets are really dangerous.

27:00.368 --> 27:03.663
And America
is more about health and wellness now.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.957
Americans love
anything about weight loss.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.293
Any gimmick!

27:08.376 --> 27:10.920
-They want fast and easy!

27:11.004 --> 27:12.714
Can we get a Kardashian?

27:12.797 --> 27:16.760
Come on. Surely you agree,
Americans love a shortcut.

27:16.843 --> 27:19.179
A drive-thru. A quick fix.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.015
Well, yeah. Sure we do.

27:22.098 --> 27:24.934
Then soup's not gonna work.
It takes too long to cook.

27:25.018 --> 27:27.520
We'd need something that's ready to go.

27:27.604 --> 27:30.565
That's bottled, like,
I don't know, cold-pressed juice.

27:31.399 --> 27:32.901
Cold-pressed leek juice!

27:32.984 --> 27:34.402
Leek you can drink.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.906
Choose the magic soup from Goop!

27:40.158 --> 27:41.284
<i>Voilà.</i>

28:06.976 --> 28:11.481
<i>-Merci. Merci.</i> Thank you. Thank you.
-<i>Merci.</i>

28:11.606 --> 28:15.151
<i>-Merci beaucoup. Merci, monsieur.</i>
<i>-Ah, merci.</i>

28:15.235 --> 28:17.570
You were right, Benoît.
This is good money.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.614
-Told you.

28:31.418 --> 28:34.379
Can they do that? Isn't this our spot?

28:34.462 --> 28:35.505
We don't own it.

28:36.589 --> 28:39.968
-Guys, let's not lose our audience, okay?
-Yeah.

29:21.384 --> 29:23.636
-What's he doing?
-Ignore him, Mindy.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.847
Here's your cue. Come on.

29:43.990 --> 29:44.991
Am I off key?

29:45.074 --> 29:48.203
No. You sound amazing.
Don't let him get to you.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.624
Mimes are an occupational hazard.
They always steal our tips.

29:52.707 --> 29:53.708
Uh!

29:53.792 --> 29:54.793
Not today!

30:07.680 --> 30:09.390
-Whoo!

30:53.893 --> 30:56.145
-Emily Cooper?
-How dare you.

31:00.608 --> 31:01.860
Ooh, is it for me?

31:01.943 --> 31:04.404
<i>Oui.</i> A client, Camille.

31:05.947 --> 31:06.781
Oh, it's in French.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.908
Allow me to translate.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.035
"Emily…"

31:12.245 --> 31:14.622
I don't understand
why you did what you did,

31:16.624 --> 31:19.711
just like I don't understand
a fucking word in your letter.

31:19.794 --> 31:23.673
Leave me alone, you illiterate sociopath.

31:24.757 --> 31:25.967
"…Camille."

31:28.553 --> 31:30.513
Oops, oops, oops.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.390
Sorry, Emily.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.143
Unlike magic leek soup,

31:35.226 --> 31:38.605
there's no "quick fix"

32:14.182 --> 32:15.808
<i>Bonjour</i> again.

32:17.393 --> 32:18.978
I knew you'd be back.
