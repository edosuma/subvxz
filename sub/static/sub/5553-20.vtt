00:02.735 --> 00:04.335
(birds singing,
insects trilling)

00:04.337 --> 00:06.837
SHELDON:
It's nice to get back to nature.

00:07.079 --> 00:08.812
Why don't I do this more often?

00:12.685 --> 00:15.486
What a beautiful forest.

00:15.488 --> 00:17.254
(gasps delightedly)

00:17.256 --> 00:20.224
Hello, little butterfly.

00:21.381 --> 00:22.780
What's your Na...

00:22.782 --> 00:24.849
(screams)

00:24.851 --> 00:26.450
Whatcha doing?

00:26.452 --> 00:29.186
I was enjoying
some virtual reality,

00:29.188 --> 00:32.189
until you ruined it
with your actual face.

00:32.191 --> 00:34.492
What am I smelling?

00:34.494 --> 00:35.793
Oh, it's car
air freshener.

00:35.795 --> 00:38.763
I was simulating
the smell of the forest.

00:38.765 --> 00:40.731
That's not what
the forest smells like.

00:40.733 --> 00:42.900
Well, how would I know?

00:45.305 --> 00:46.404
Why are you pretending
to be outdoors?

00:46.406 --> 00:47.405
You hate it.

00:47.407 --> 00:48.572
Hmm? Oh.

00:48.574 --> 00:50.374
Amy showed me a compelling study

00:50.376 --> 00:52.276
that demonstrated
the cognitive benefit

00:52.278 --> 00:53.844
of spending time
in the wilderness.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.246
Buddy, I am ready
to drive you

00:55.248 --> 00:56.881
into the wilderness
any time you want

00:56.883 --> 00:58.649
and leave you there.

00:58.651 --> 01:01.752
Well, make your jokes,
but some of the participants

01:01.754 --> 01:04.655
who spent four days in the woods
away from all technology

01:04.657 --> 01:08.092
reported a 50% gain in reasoning
skills upon their return.

01:08.094 --> 01:11.963
Okay, if that's true, why aren't
there more genius squirrels?

01:14.934 --> 01:17.368
You may need this
more than I do.

Here's your tea.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.788
Oh!

01:55.790 --> 01:59.625
Do not sneak up on a guy
when he's sitting on a log.

01:59.627 --> 02:02.194
You know, if you really
want to be in nature,

02:02.196 --> 02:03.829
why don't we rent a cabin?

02:03.831 --> 02:05.765
Look, I'm sorry,
when did you even get here? I...

02:07.035 --> 02:08.800
You know,
there's a cabin in Big Bear

02:08.803 --> 02:10.669
that a doctor I work with
keeps offering me.

02:10.670 --> 02:11.971
Because he's
hitting on you?

02:11.973 --> 02:12.972
She.

02:12.974 --> 02:14.507
Oh, good.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.108
But I could get her.

02:17.812 --> 02:19.512
We could all go
for the weekend.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.413
It'll be fun.

02:20.415 --> 02:21.847
Yeah... (clears throat)
Excuse me.

02:26.687 --> 02:28.521
Here, look up "fun,"
get back to me.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.291
You and I could still go
and have a nice weekend.

02:32.293 --> 02:33.325
Sure.

02:33.327 --> 02:35.227
Come on, Sheldon,
let's go with them.

02:35.229 --> 02:36.829
I hardly think so.

02:36.831 --> 02:38.864
You be sure and say hello

02:38.866 --> 02:41.901
to all the mosquitoes,
bees, bears, snakes,

02:41.903 --> 02:43.335
possums, poison oak,

02:43.337 --> 02:47.206
oh, and last, but not least,
teenagers with guitars.

02:49.110 --> 02:51.243
I'll see
if it's available.

02:51.245 --> 02:53.813
You know,
if that study's real,

02:53.815 --> 02:55.448
Leonard might come back
smarter than you.

02:55.450 --> 02:58.617
Are you trying to manipulate me?
Yes.

02:58.619 --> 02:59.785
Well done, it worked,
we're going.

02:59.787 --> 03:01.220
Yay!

03:02.290 --> 03:04.356
(bags rustling)
BERNADETTE: Come on, Raj,

03:04.358 --> 03:06.025
give me a bag.

03:06.027 --> 03:07.126
No, no, you're pregnant.

03:07.128 --> 03:08.794
The only thing you carry

03:08.796 --> 03:11.931
is our hope
for a better tomorrow.

03:12.967 --> 03:15.067
Hey, where you been?

03:15.069 --> 03:16.969
Uh, Raj took me
to the baby doctor

03:16.971 --> 03:18.337
and then we swung by
the grocery store.

03:18.339 --> 03:19.805
(tires screeching on game)
Did you get graham crackers?

03:19.807 --> 03:24.076
I mean, are... what...
is the baby okay?

03:24.078 --> 03:25.978
Yes and yes.

03:25.980 --> 03:27.246
(sighs)

03:27.248 --> 03:29.248
I didn't know you needed help
running errands today.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.883
I didn't,
but Raj volunteered.

03:30.885 --> 03:32.017
Really?

03:32.019 --> 03:33.219
Yeah, ever since you told him
I was pregnant,

03:33.221 --> 03:34.854
he's really been making
a fuss over me.

03:34.856 --> 03:37.323
Oh. Well, I guess
that's kind of sweet.

03:37.325 --> 03:41.227
Bernie, I just
forwarded you a list

03:41.229 --> 03:44.296
of the top five lactation
consultants in Los Angeles.

03:44.298 --> 03:45.664
I know my favorite,

03:45.666 --> 03:48.367
but I'd love to hear
what you think.

03:49.770 --> 03:51.937
And it just got weird.

03:55.309 --> 03:56.809
Hey. Amy's downstairs.

03:56.811 --> 03:58.644
Okay, one sec.

03:58.646 --> 04:01.280
Uh, what-what you got
goin' on here?

04:02.683 --> 04:04.250
I bought a baseball cap.

04:04.252 --> 04:05.885
I can see that.

04:05.887 --> 04:07.052
What team did you get?

04:07.054 --> 04:10.289
Uh, Hufflepuff,
from <i>Harry Potter.</i>

04:11.792 --> 04:13.292
Well, we'll be in the woods.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.595
I'm ready to go.

04:19.267 --> 04:21.100
Anything you'd like
to say to <i>him?</i>

04:21.101 --> 04:22.501
Nice hat, Sheldon.

04:22.503 --> 04:25.004
Thanks.

04:25.006 --> 04:26.939
Why are you
so mean to me?

04:29.410 --> 04:31.610
(woman screaming in pain)

04:37.251 --> 04:39.852
(screaming continues)

04:39.854 --> 04:42.121
What the hell are you watching?

04:42.123 --> 04:45.791
Raj found all these
childbirth videos online.

04:45.793 --> 04:48.627
This one is of a woman
giving birth in a river.

04:48.629 --> 04:51.964
Okay, that is
the least Jewish thing

04:51.966 --> 04:54.266
I've ever seen in my life.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.838
You feel like Raj is getting
a little carried away

04:59.840 --> 05:01.307
with all the baby stuff?

05:01.309 --> 05:02.474
I don't think so.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.176
He just wants to be
part of the experience.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.445
All right, if you say so.

05:06.447 --> 05:07.546
What's in the box?

05:07.548 --> 05:08.948
Oh, it's an ultrasonic
microphone

05:08.950 --> 05:10.316
so we can hear
the baby's heartbeat.

05:10.318 --> 05:12.117
Oh.

05:12.119 --> 05:13.118
That's cool.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.119
Can we try it?

05:14.121 --> 05:15.721
Actually, Raj ordered it.

05:15.723 --> 05:18.524
He made me promise
to wait till he was here.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.192
So he can be...

05:20.194 --> 05:22.161
part of the experience?

05:22.163 --> 05:23.362
Yeah.

05:23.364 --> 05:26.932
I'm surprised he let us conceive
without him.

05:26.934 --> 05:29.835
It's a sore spot--
don't bring it up.

05:32.907 --> 05:34.573
It's so cute
and rustic up here.

05:34.575 --> 05:35.808
I know.

05:35.810 --> 05:37.843
Did you see they still have
a video rental place?

05:37.845 --> 05:40.045
it's like Colonial Williamsburg.

05:40.047 --> 05:42.281
Well...

05:42.283 --> 05:44.984
cell service is down
to one bar,

05:44.986 --> 05:47.219
so if anyone needs
medical attention

05:47.221 --> 05:49.655
or to tell a stranger their
political views are stupid,

05:49.657 --> 05:50.990
now's the time.

05:51.892 --> 05:53.892
Have you ever been
off the grid before?

05:53.894 --> 05:55.561
Once.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.062
The battery ran out on my phone.

05:57.064 --> 05:59.498
I had to wait
for my iPad to turn on.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.935
I was afraid
he was gonna eat me.

06:05.206 --> 06:07.072
Raj just pulled up.

06:07.074 --> 06:09.842
I'm gonna say something to him.

06:09.844 --> 06:11.877
Leave it alone.
He means well.

06:11.879 --> 06:14.780
So you don't think he needs
to rein it in a little?

06:14.782 --> 06:16.849
No, not really.

06:16.851 --> 06:18.417
And you're not concerned

06:18.419 --> 06:21.287
he's acting like somehow
this is his kid, too?

06:21.289 --> 06:23.422
He's just trying
to be supportive.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.190
Just supportive.

06:25.192 --> 06:27.192
Not over-the-top in any way?

06:27.194 --> 06:29.194
No.

06:29.196 --> 06:30.963
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Hello!

06:36.203 --> 06:37.636
You saw him carrying that.

06:37.638 --> 06:40.906
Astronauts saw him
carrying that.

06:47.381 --> 06:48.347
(gasps)

06:48.349 --> 06:49.915
This place is great!

06:49.917 --> 06:52.484
So nice of that doctor
to just let you use it.

06:52.486 --> 06:54.920
Well, she is taking me
to an Indigo Girls concert,

06:54.922 --> 06:56.655
so hold that thought.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.825
Okay.

06:59.827 --> 07:01.327
Well,

07:01.329 --> 07:03.462
should we check
each other for ticks?

07:05.833 --> 07:09.501
Sheldon, all we did
was walk in from the car.

07:09.503 --> 07:11.136
Oh. Well,
suit yourself.

07:11.138 --> 07:13.339
Who wants to check me?

07:16.210 --> 07:18.510
On the other hand, safety first.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:27.514 --> 07:29.381
(rain falling loudly)

07:29.383 --> 07:31.049
Wow, it's really
coming down.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.517
This sucks.

07:32.519 --> 07:33.818
And there goes our hike.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.621
Oh, not our hike!

07:36.623 --> 07:38.023
Now we have

07:38.025 --> 07:40.458
to stay safe and warm.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.027
You know, we could still go.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.461
A little rain
isn't gonna kill us.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.197
Have you been outside
in the rain with Sheldon?

07:45.199 --> 07:47.232
No.
You'll wish it would kill you.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.036
So what do we do now?

07:51.038 --> 07:52.304
They have
some board games.

07:52.306 --> 07:54.906
Eh, most of the Jenga
pieces are missing

07:54.908 --> 07:56.942
and the Scrabble
only has seven tiles,

07:56.944 --> 07:59.444
so unless you want to build
an unimpressive structure

07:59.446 --> 08:02.447
with the word "SHNERPF"
next to it, move on.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.216
Hey, let's light a fire.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.351
Ooh, that sounds cozy.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.919
I don't think
I've lit a real fire before.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.754
Ah, it's basic thermodynamics.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.156
I'm sure we can figure that out.

08:11.158 --> 08:14.459
I could stack the logs conically
to facilitate airflow.

08:14.461 --> 08:17.062
That would maximize oxygen
for optimal combustion.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.530
(fire whooshes)
Right. So all we need is to...

08:18.532 --> 08:20.098
Got it.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.369
A scientist made that.

08:26.740 --> 08:30.308
Look, Raj, you're my
best friend in the world

08:30.310 --> 08:35.013
and I really appreciate
your enthusiasm about the baby.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.849
Please, my pleasure.

08:39.253 --> 08:40.452
And, of course,
Howie and I

08:40.453 --> 08:42.053
both want you to be
a part of all this.

08:42.054 --> 08:45.123
But we have to set
some boundaries.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.025
I don't understand.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.895
The three of us
aren't having this baby.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.598
Just the two of us.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.101
Oh...

08:57.104 --> 08:59.304
Okay. Yeah, I get it.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.706
I'll back off.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.441
Thanks for understanding.

09:03.443 --> 09:04.476
Of course.

09:04.478 --> 09:07.779
I'll give you guys some space.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.383
Let me just get this
out of your way.

09:19.826 --> 09:20.825
You need some help?

09:20.827 --> 09:23.395
No, I got it.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.101
(clattering)

09:30.103 --> 09:30.969
(grunts)

09:30.971 --> 09:32.003
Raj... Raj, wait.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.239
Please, Bernadette.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.242
Let me leave with my dignity.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.950
(thumps)

09:48.822 --> 09:51.089
Hey, you guys want
to play a drinking game?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.024
Oh, well now, well now,
we'll never win.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.727
You always play
the drinking game.

09:55.729 --> 09:59.264
Not <i>the</i> drinking game,
<i>a</i> drinking game.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.633
To be fair, good at both.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.134
What's the game?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.502
All right, it's called
Never Have I Ever.

10:04.504 --> 10:05.704
The rules are simple.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.038
Someone says something
they've never done,

10:07.040 --> 10:09.074
but if you have done it,
you take a drink.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.241
I've never played that before.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.276
(stammers)
Hey, now, wait.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.277
Have we started?
Do I drink?

10:12.279 --> 10:14.813
What is happening?
Okay.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.514
Calm down.
I'll go first.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.016
All right, let's see.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.318
Never have I ever...

10:20.320 --> 10:22.687
She's trying
to think of something

10:22.689 --> 10:23.688
she's never done before.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.256
This could take a while.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.459
Very funny.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.494
Okay, never have I ever...

10:30.464 --> 10:31.830
Yeah, you know what?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.031
Let's just circle back.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.766
Okay, I'll go.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.068
Never have I ever been arrested.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.503
So I drink.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.338
No, it's only
if you've done it.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.241
Got it.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.978
I can't believe
you've been arrested.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.014
I can't believe Penny hasn't.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.385
Sheldon, what did you do?

10:53.387 --> 10:54.919
Well, I'm not proud of it,

10:54.921 --> 10:57.422
but... I jaywalked.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.357
Oh, no, it's like
a horror movie.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.427
We're trapped in a cabin
with a maniac.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.296
I'm surprised
you would do that.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.931
No, I crossed
in the middle of the street.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.299
And normally, I wouldn't,

11:08.301 --> 11:11.269
but I saw an aggressive-looking
Girl Scout,

11:11.271 --> 11:14.139
and it was the heart
of cookie season.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.574
Anyway, there was
a police officer,

11:16.576 --> 11:18.443
and he witnessed
the whole thing.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.145
What-- he arrested you for that?

11:20.147 --> 11:21.513
(stammers)
No, he didn't do anything.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.881
So I said,
"You just saw me jaywalk.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.048
Why aren't you
doing your job?"

11:24.050 --> 11:25.250
You know?

11:27.587 --> 11:28.987
"M-Maybe I should arrest you

11:28.989 --> 11:31.523
for-for impersonating
a police officer."

11:32.125 --> 11:33.958
And then you got arrested.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.460
Oh, and how.

11:37.697 --> 11:41.132
I feel like I just made
a horrible mistake.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.467
Yeah.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.635
But on the other hand,

11:43.637 --> 11:45.103
I didn't kick him
out of our lives.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.806
I just asked him
to back off a little.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.307
Yeah.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.910
What? Are you gonna cry?

11:51.912 --> 11:54.179
(crying):
Yeah!

11:55.215 --> 11:58.483
Is it baby hormones
or actually sad?

11:58.485 --> 12:01.953
I can't tell anymore!

12:02.823 --> 12:04.823
I'll go get him.

12:04.825 --> 12:08.393
And bring back the bear!

12:11.498 --> 12:12.797
This game's dangerous.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.132
I could get you in trouble.

12:14.134 --> 12:14.999
How?

12:15.001 --> 12:16.468
Well, never have I ever

12:16.470 --> 12:19.571
used Sheldon's toothbrush
to clean the sink.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.712
Fine, is that
how you want to play this?

12:27.714 --> 12:30.014
All right,
never have I ever come up

12:30.016 --> 12:32.650
with a nickname
for my own genitals.

12:33.887 --> 12:37.222
Never should've told you
about Alvin and the Chipmunks.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.991
AMY:
Okay.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.125
My turn.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.127
Um...

12:43.129 --> 12:45.430
Never have I ever

12:45.432 --> 12:48.900
completely rocked
my girlfriend's world in bed.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.202
(stammers)
Amy...

12:51.204 --> 12:53.004
You know the rules.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.106
Drink.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.608
(clears throat)

12:56.610 --> 12:57.876
Yeah, go ahead.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.313
That's right.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.649
All right, my turn.

13:04.651 --> 13:05.650
Mm...

13:05.652 --> 13:07.285
Oh, I know.

13:07.287 --> 13:11.022
Never have I ever
kept a secret bank account,

13:11.024 --> 13:14.325
because I think
my wife can't handle money.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.197
Did I win?

13:19.199 --> 13:21.699
I feel like I won.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.234
I can't believe this.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.970
You realize I make
more money than you?

13:25.972 --> 13:27.672
I don't, I know,
but this isn't a big deal.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.974
It's just a little savings
I put aside.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.042
We're married.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.377
We're supposed
to share everything.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.413
What-- you mean, like,
your massive credit card debt?

13:39.619 --> 13:41.219
(door slams)

13:41.221 --> 13:42.220
I'm calling it.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.922
I won.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.459
I appreciate the apology,

13:48.461 --> 13:50.261
but it's really not necessary.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.796
I overstepped my bounds.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.231
No, Raj, you've been great.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.500
I just, I need to start
doing my part around here.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.968
BERNADETTE:
I hear that.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.705
Well, if that's the case,

14:00.707 --> 14:02.407
is there anything
I can do to help?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.042
Well, not right now.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.777
But we could try out
that microphone you got us,

14:05.779 --> 14:07.445
and listen to
the baby's heartbeat.

14:07.447 --> 14:08.713
Really?

14:08.715 --> 14:10.548
It's okay if I listen with you?!

14:10.550 --> 14:11.816
Of course.

14:11.818 --> 14:15.820
Can I squirt the ultrasound
jelly on your stomach?

14:16.923 --> 14:18.022
Hey, look at that.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.592
It's weird again.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.295
(door opens)

14:24.297 --> 14:25.897
Okay, you have

14:25.899 --> 14:26.998
every right to be mad.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.099
And what you said is true.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.200
You do make more money than me.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.635
So I had no right
to do what I did.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.437
And I'm so sorry.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.038
I hope you can forgive me.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.240
How long have you had
this secret account?

14:36.242 --> 14:38.676
A couple years,
but I just put a few bucks aside

14:38.678 --> 14:40.878
every month for emergencies.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.347
Well, how much you got in there?

14:42.349 --> 14:44.749
$6,427.

14:44.751 --> 14:48.820
$47 once my nana's
birthday check gets here.

14:48.822 --> 14:50.588
My God, Leonard,
do you know

14:50.590 --> 14:52.123
what I could do
with that kind of money?

14:52.125 --> 14:54.826
No, I do,
and that's why I hid it.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.396
What good is it
if you don't use it?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.999
Uh, uh, you have shoes
you love, but never wear.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.567
I have money I love,

15:02.569 --> 15:03.635
but never spend.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.470
We're kind of
a cute couple that way.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.571
Again,

15:06.573 --> 15:07.605
I'm sorry.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.140
I shouldn't have
kept it a secret.

15:09.142 --> 15:12.443
Well, I have a secret
I've been keeping from you, too.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.045
Is it a secret bank account?

15:14.047 --> 15:16.314
Because that would be awesome.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.316
I hate my job.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.717
Really?

15:19.719 --> 15:20.752
Why?

15:20.754 --> 15:22.053
Because I don't feel good

15:22.055 --> 15:23.655
flirting with doctors for sales.

15:23.657 --> 15:24.722
I mean, I know
I make a lot of money.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.824
But I haven't been happy
for a while.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.793
Why didn't you tell me?

15:28.795 --> 15:30.328
Because I know
how important it is to you

15:30.330 --> 15:31.896
that I'm having some success.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.264
That's not true.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.666
Okay, really?
So you'd be fine if I went

15:34.668 --> 15:36.701
back to acting
and waiting tables again?

15:36.703 --> 15:38.569
If that's what you
want to do, yes.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.371
Well, it's not
what I want to do.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.774
Oh, yes.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.142
Doesn't matter what I want.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.077
Look, this job is
gonna get me out of debt.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.546
So I'm gonna do the grown-up
thing and see it through.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.916
Well, that is
the grown-up thing.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.384
I guess.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.720
I love you.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.322
I love you, too.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.425
You know,

16:00.427 --> 16:03.327
never have I ever made love

16:03.329 --> 16:06.364
in the forest
while it was raining.

16:06.366 --> 16:09.000
Well, guess I gotta drink.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.841
All right, here we go.

16:16.843 --> 16:19.043
(microphone droning)

16:20.714 --> 16:22.680
I'm not hearing anything.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.282
Well, give me a second.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.651
Are you sure you can do this?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.086
Hey, who found
four dollars and change

16:28.088 --> 16:31.389
on the beach
with his metal detector?

16:31.391 --> 16:34.559
I buried it there,
so we could go home.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.764
(heartbeat echoing, gasps)

16:39.766 --> 16:41.966
Wait, that's it.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.434
Wow.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.372
Isn't that the best?

16:49.209 --> 16:51.242
You guys made a person.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.916
We did.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.919
And I like to think
I helped.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.625
(whispering):
You didn't.

17:16.111 --> 17:18.944
SHELDON:
Oh, let me see.

17:18.946 --> 17:21.714
Oh, um, never have I ever

17:21.717 --> 17:25.218
drunk milk past
its expiration date.

17:28.190 --> 17:31.124
Never have I ever

17:31.126 --> 17:34.227
cancelled
a dentist appointment.

17:37.799 --> 17:39.866
Oh, uh, never have I ever

17:39.868 --> 17:43.036
put my foot in the ocean.

17:47.142 --> 17:48.975
Never have I ever

17:48.977 --> 17:52.646
honked if I liked anything.

17:56.318 --> 17:57.384
Oh!

17:57.386 --> 18:00.220
Uh... never have I ever

18:00.222 --> 18:04.290
thrown, caught or touched
a Frisbee.

18:10.298 --> 18:13.266
Never have I ever

18:13.268 --> 18:15.635
put salt on my food

18:15.637 --> 18:17.604
without trying it first.

18:17.606 --> 18:19.806
Yeah...

18:21.009 --> 18:22.742
Oh!

18:22.744 --> 18:24.911
Never have I ever

18:24.913 --> 18:27.947
pushed all the buttons
in an elevator.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.852
(gasps)

18:34.089 --> 18:36.322
Well, we all have a past.
