00:15.048 --> 00:16.015
MAN: Who's that?

00:16.116 --> 00:17.879
HARRIMAN:
Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.548
Two years ago, dogfight over Antarctica.

00:21.888 --> 00:24.914
SG-1 found the Ancient outpost,
took out Anubis' fleet.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.993
-That's him?
-That's him.

00:32.799 --> 00:36.462
MITCHELL: Remember, no matter what,
we're here to protect SG-1 at all costs.

00:41.308 --> 00:44.004
Target the AIkesh first, gliders second.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.875
Go Iow, boys and girls.
Prometheus has our backs.

00:48.682 --> 00:49.979
(MISSILES FIRING)

00:57.457 --> 00:59.948
Break Ieft. Two gliders at our 3 o'clock.

01:06.299 --> 01:07.857
Prometheus.

01:07.968 --> 01:09.993
HAMMOND ON RADIO:
SG-1, this is Hammond. Do you read?

01:11.138 --> 01:12.833
Yes, sir. It's good to see you.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.345
(BEEPING)

01:20.547 --> 01:22.742
Contact.
One bandit on the deck and inbound.

01:22.849 --> 01:23.816
Tally, One.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.481
MITCHELL: Fox Two, Fox Two.

01:31.958 --> 01:33.186
So close.

01:35.962 --> 01:38.226
BANKS: We've been hit.
Left thruster is down.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.390
Contact. Two bandits on our six.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.009
BIue Ieader, we 've got your six.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.279
Nice shot, Red!

02:12.098 --> 02:14.225
-He 's been hit!
-Redmond!

02:15.836 --> 02:17.133
He 's gone.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.949
Chief Master Sergeant Walter Harriman.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.721
The General's ready for you, Colonel.

02:37.724 --> 02:40.386
-It's bigger than I thought it would be.
-Yes, sir.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.461
Welcome to Stargate Command.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.528
Feel free to have a seat.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.264
General Landry will be with you shortly.

03:59.372 --> 04:01.363
He's just finishing up
a briefing with SG-12.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.203
Thank you, Sergeant.

04:07.547 --> 04:09.378
(LANDRY CHATTERING)

04:18.725 --> 04:20.454
MITCHELL: AII right, boys and girls,
Iisten up.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.291
We've got a change of plans.
New orders from General Hammond.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.490
We are no longer going after
Anubis' mother ship.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.329
SG-1 is on its way to Antarctica
in a cargo ship.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.494
SG-1?

04:30.603 --> 04:32.833
They think they may have found
the Lost City of the Ancients.

04:32.939 --> 04:33.906
In Antarctica?

04:34.007 --> 04:35.770
It doesn't matter where they are
or what it is they're doing.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.343
It's SG-1,
and we're gonna cover their asses.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.707
ETA is nine minutes.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.678
Expect the enemy
to throw everything they have at us.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.271
All right, saddle up, folks.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.941
LANDRY: Cocky sons ofbitches.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.051
(SlGHlNG) Marines. Never liked them.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.259
-You must be Colonel Mitchell.
-Yes, sir.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.419
It's good to be here, sir.

04:56.529 --> 05:00.556
Your service record's impeccable, Mitchell.
What's wrong with you?

05:01.901 --> 05:03.835
-Sir?
-Nobody's perfect.

05:03.937 --> 05:07.168
Everyone has some sort of character flaw.
What's yours?

05:08.174 --> 05:10.802
Sometimes I can be impatient, sir.

05:10.910 --> 05:14.471
Well, all pilots have type A personalities.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.913
I'm talking about your kryptonite.

05:18.518 --> 05:21.180
Don't worry. I'll figure it out. Walter!

05:21.287 --> 05:22.447
HARRIMAN ON INTERCOM:
The files on your desk

05:22.555 --> 05:24.580
are the personnel folders
you're about to request, sir.

05:24.691 --> 05:27.159
"About to request?"
Walter, I'd appreciate it...

05:27.260 --> 05:29.353
You ha ve to push the button to talk, sir.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.327
Thank you, Walter.

05:35.969 --> 05:39.735
You know, the thing that's hardest
to get used to around here

05:40.673 --> 05:43.267
is how good everybody is at their job.

05:44.144 --> 05:48.171
Fact is, I like yelling at people.
Never get the damn chance.

05:49.115 --> 05:51.447
I'll try not to lower the average, sir.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.512
Oh, a self-deprecating sense of humor.

05:55.889 --> 06:00.087
You think it'll make people like you
despite your outward perfection.

06:01.394 --> 06:03.419
-No.
-Here you go, son.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.929
-Get started.
-Sir?

06:07.801 --> 06:11.066
You heard the disconnected voice
of the little sergeant

06:11.171 --> 06:14.334
with psychic powers.
Those are personnel files.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.238
Start picking your team.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.379
General, I'm here to join SG-1.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.643
Colonel, you're here to lead SG-1.

06:28.788 --> 06:32.280
What about Lieutenant Colonel Carter?

06:32.525 --> 06:36.859
She's taken command
of Stargate's R&D out of Area 51.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.897
-Since when?
-Last week.

06:38.998 --> 06:43.230
-And Daniel Jackson?
-Dr. Jackson put in for reassignment.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.004
Teal'c left the program over a month ago.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.075
I'm surprised General O'Neill
didn't tell you.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.366
No.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.737
Well, that's Jack for you.

06:52.846 --> 06:56.475
You know, I looked for the key
to that desk for a week

06:56.583 --> 06:59.609
before I finally got him to admit
he never had one.

06:59.719 --> 07:03.177
The man never opened a drawer
the whole time he was here.

07:03.289 --> 07:05.382
I'm sorry, sir.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.993
The reason that I requested this post...

07:12.031 --> 07:13.191
Why...

07:14.434 --> 07:16.299
Why I worked so hard...

07:18.104 --> 07:22.541
"Expresses himself poorly
when faced with unexpected challenge?"

07:23.810 --> 07:27.803
Your sheet says that you have
outstanding leadership skills.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.481
Take the files, Colonel. Choose your team

07:31.584 --> 07:34.576
before I start to question
the accuracy of that claim.

07:37.557 --> 07:38.751
Yes, sir.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.091
(KNOCKlNG ON DOOR)

07:43.930 --> 07:45.261
Dr. Jackson.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.460
Colonel.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.759
-My friends call me Cameron.
-Daniel.

07:52.539 --> 07:54.700
-How are you?
-I'm good, thanks.

07:54.941 --> 07:58.707
-Yeah. I heard you were coming.
-Yeah. They told me you were leaving.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.278
Yes, finally.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.708
You don't... You don't wanna help?

08:03.816 --> 08:06.876
No. Actually, I came to see
if I could talk you into staying.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.214
You're kidding.

08:08.888 --> 08:11.220
I've been given command of SG-1.

08:12.759 --> 08:16.354
Wow. Oh.
Well, good for you. You deserve it.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.759
I think the SGC still needs you.

08:18.865 --> 08:20.526
There's lots of other guys.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.295
You're the world's foremost expert
on the Ancients.

08:23.403 --> 08:27.305
Yes, and that's why I'm going
to Atlantis, "City of the Ancients."

08:27.407 --> 08:32.743
Listen, General O'Neill gave me the choice
of any posting I wanted.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.278
I chose SG-1.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.973
That meant Colonel Carter, Teal'c
and yourself,

08:37.083 --> 08:39.950
-not two letters, a dash and a number.
-That's nice.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.317
I wanted to be on the front line
working with the best.

08:42.422 --> 08:43.855
I wanted to learn from you.

08:43.957 --> 08:47.449
-Look, this is all very flattering, but...
-That's not the point.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.287
I'm sorry.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.928
I know I owe you one.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.498
We all do.

09:01.574 --> 09:02.598
We've Iost a turbine.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.233
CARTER: Heads up, BIue Ieader.
This is Carter.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.211
-We have another bandit incoming.
-I see it, Major.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.682
MITCHELL: Fox Two.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.583
Splash. One AIkesh.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.384
That was close.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.457
Listen, Jackson,

09:29.869 --> 09:33.066
I don't want you to stay
because you think you owe me one.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.769
-Unless of course you're considering it.
-Oh, no, no.

09:36.876 --> 09:39.868
I was just gonna offer you my apartment.

09:45.785 --> 09:46.911
Right.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.423
MlTCHELL: Brother,
I love what you've done with the place.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.118
These columns
were salvaged and restored

09:55.228 --> 09:58.959
-from the original Ancient monument.
-It's got a real High Council feel to it.

09:59.065 --> 10:02.000
Hope you're taking lots of before
and after pictures.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.101
Where's the rest of your team,
Colonel Mitchell?

10:04.203 --> 10:07.468
Actually, it's still kind of SG-me.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.509
That's one of the reasons I'm here.

10:09.509 --> 10:10.373
That's one of the reasons I'm here.

10:10.476 --> 10:13.502
I was hoping maybe you could help me.

10:16.649 --> 10:20.210
I can offer some names of those
I consider to be honorable warriors.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.618
I'd appreciate that. I know you're busy.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.350
We are attempting to build
a whole new system of government

10:25.458 --> 10:28.086
that will span Jaffa worlds
throughout the galaxy.

10:28.194 --> 10:31.061
-Yeah, how's that going?
-Not well.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.059
Well, your people
did just renounce their gods.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.828
Guess you've got to cut them
a bit of a break.

10:35.935 --> 10:39.336
Too many are still steeped
in an old culture full of antiquated rituals

10:39.439 --> 10:41.634
and are slow to accept change.

10:41.741 --> 10:44.539
I understand Major Davis and SG-7
are trying to help out.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.544
That has caused problems as well.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.343
Many view the Tau'ri with the same level
of mistrust as a would-be enemy.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.145
They see
the proposed system of government

10:52.251 --> 10:55.152
as a means to control and subvert
their newly acquired freedom.

10:55.254 --> 10:58.712
My allegiance to the Tau'ri is not
serving me as well as you might think

10:58.825 --> 11:01.953
in winning votes from the most traditional
of the Jaffa electorate.

11:02.061 --> 11:03.119
Wow.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.393
Politics really does suck
everywhere you go.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.692
Indeed.

11:08.568 --> 11:11.162
Listen, maybe it's a good thing I came by.

11:11.270 --> 11:14.899
If this doesn't work out,
before all the space on my team fills...

11:15.007 --> 11:17.908
Teal'c, the Council's returning from recess.

11:18.277 --> 11:20.006
-I must go.
-Sure.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.410
It has been good to see you,
Colonel Mitchell.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.481
Yeah.

11:22.582 --> 11:25.016
I will forward a list of names
as soon as I am able.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.312
Have fun.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.220
Did I mention I'm on a mission from God?

11:30.556 --> 11:31.887
Okay. Never mind.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.750
Yo, you wanna join SG-1?

11:35.428 --> 11:37.896
Hi. Cameron Mitchell. Colonel.

11:38.731 --> 11:41.063
Excuse me, can you tell me
which way to the stargate?

11:41.167 --> 11:43.135
Stargate. Chappa'ai.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.204
Just point a finger.

11:52.178 --> 11:55.011
-Hi, Cameron.
-Hey, Sam. It's good to see you.

11:55.114 --> 11:56.741
Sorry it took me so Iong
to get back to you.

11:56.849 --> 11:59.443
We ha ve been up to our ears
double checking the new hyperdrive.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.214
And then the uplink was jammed
with the Iong-range plotting program

12:02.321 --> 12:04.551
being transmitted by the Asgard...

12:04.724 --> 12:07.352
No need to bore you.
How you been? You Iook good.

12:07.493 --> 12:08.551
Thanks.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.960
Listen, Sam, come back and rejoin SG-1.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.498
I heard you'd been given command.
Congratulations.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.589
I'm not kidding.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.635
You can keep an eye on R&D
in your spare time

12:17.737 --> 12:19.102
just like you always have.

12:19.205 --> 12:22.834
Besides, Dr. Lee is pouting
because you got the post over him.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.670
-Really?
-No, I made that up.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.637
I have my reasons for wanting this job.

12:28.748 --> 12:32.013
I had my reasons for wanting this job.
One of them was working with you.

12:32.118 --> 12:35.246
And please do not say, "That's nice."

12:35.354 --> 12:38.152
-We'II still work together.
-lt won't be the same.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.419
What if the world needs saving?

12:40.526 --> 12:43.654
Well, if the world needs saving
I will be there to do what I can.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.254
What if the world needs saving
because I screwed up

12:46.365 --> 12:48.856
because you weren't here
in the first place?

12:51.471 --> 12:53.302
How about we pretend I didn't say that?

12:53.406 --> 12:54.373
Done.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.135
WOMAN ON PA:
Lieutenant Colonel Carter to the Bridge.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.938
Lieutenant Colonel Carter,
please report immediately to the Bridge.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.013
-Sorry, I gotta go.
-Y eah.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.514
Buy you breakfast
when you get back on solid ground.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.209
You're on. I'II talk to you soon.

13:11.924 --> 13:13.357
(GROANlNG)

13:14.393 --> 13:19.262
Well, Walter, it doesn't look like
we're getting the band back together.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.394
MITCHELL: I can't shake him!
Reroute power to the...

13:28.808 --> 13:30.207
Banks, you okay?

13:32.912 --> 13:34.038
Banks!

13:36.115 --> 13:38.481
I'm losing it. Hang on back there.

13:38.718 --> 13:40.151
Eject! Eject!

13:41.621 --> 13:43.555
Damn it! Ejection failed.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.184
Mayday! Mayday! We are going in.
Repeat, we are going in.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.604
So did you decide to go with the desk

14:03.943 --> 14:06.707
at an angle or flush with the door?

14:07.747 --> 14:08.805
Is that what this is about?

14:08.915 --> 14:12.146
You come all the way to Colorado Springs
to check up on me?

14:12.652 --> 14:15.621
No, I had to sign the papers to my house

14:16.088 --> 14:17.180
and my car,

14:17.957 --> 14:19.151
motorcycle.

14:19.959 --> 14:23.258
You know, I'll never forget that day
on the front porch of my house

14:23.362 --> 14:25.193
you standing there saying
you wanted to tell me

14:25.298 --> 14:27.664
something about the Stargate program.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.702
I thought one of us
had surely lost his mind.

14:30.903 --> 14:32.928
That may actually be true.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.903
How are things working out for Mitchell?

14:39.378 --> 14:42.040
Oh, you could have told him
that SG-1 had been reassigned.

14:42.148 --> 14:46.482
-You should have seen his face.
-Yeah. I suppose, huh?

14:46.819 --> 14:48.980
No, he'll get his feet.

14:52.191 --> 14:53.715
The man's a survivor.

14:54.193 --> 14:57.492
He's also got the best of the best
looking out for him.

14:59.298 --> 15:02.290
A General's only as good
as the people he commands.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.732
Who said that?

15:05.037 --> 15:06.299
I just did.

15:09.942 --> 15:13.139
I mean, Douglas MacArthur
may have said something similar.

15:13.312 --> 15:17.544
Didn't he also say,
"There is no substitute for winning?"

15:22.088 --> 15:26.684
Actually, it was,
"ln war, there is no substitute for victory."

15:28.928 --> 15:31.226
You seem to have a knack for it.

15:31.998 --> 15:35.832
I am fluent in Mandarin, Russian,
Spanish, three dialects of Goa'uld,

of the cave people of P3K-447.

15:41.207 --> 15:44.267
And, of course, Ancient.
Spoken as well as written.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.935
Go ahead, say anything.

15:46.545 --> 15:47.944
No, that's okay, I believe you.

(SPEAKlNG FORElGN LANGUAGE)

15:50.082 --> 15:52.448
Which is actually just, "l believe you."

15:52.551 --> 15:53.984
"That's okay" is a modern vernacular

15:54.086 --> 15:56.486
that can't be directly translated
into Ancient. However...

15:56.589 --> 15:58.022
This is really unnecessary.

something personal.

since the inception of the program
into a viable artificial intelligence.

Wait a minute. Are you guys saying
that this thing actually exists?

17:01.821 --> 17:04.221

17:04.323 --> 17:06.416

that with your support,

perhaps the funding body would look
more favorably on our proposal.

We all had a wonderful time

The tablet, the one that leads
to the incredible Ancient buried treasure.

There is no tablet.

-What?
-I lied.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.114
I had to tell you in person.

19:51.957 --> 19:53.390
I'm pregnant.

Pretty sure it's yours anyway.
There's at least a 1-in-10 chance.

we let her through the gate.

Yep, I don't know where you got this,
but you got ripped off.

20:30.162 --> 20:33.222
-It's complete gibberish.
-It's written in code.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.337
Well, I can't crack this in a few hours.

20:41.674 --> 20:45.007

-Then why do you need me?

Well, reading it is one thing.
Understanding it is another.

20:48.213 --> 20:50.943

20:51.050 --> 20:54.747
that the treasure it describes
is here on Earth.

Now, I could have come by ship
and looked for it myself,

20:58.457 --> 21:00.925
but I know nothing about your fair planet.

interesting if somewhat limited gene pool.

-So, where'd you get this?
-The Jaffa may have won their freedom,

21:15.507 --> 21:17.805
but there's still more than
a few Goa'uld out there.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.775
Most of them have lost
their dynasties, though,

21:19.878 --> 21:21.539
and are either on the run or in hiding.

21:21.647 --> 21:24.309
Yeah, no doubt plotting some means
of regaining their power.

21:24.416 --> 21:27.317
Yes, and in the meantime,
they are having a lot of trouble

21:27.419 --> 21:29.944
maintaining the lifestyle
to which they've grown so accustomed

21:30.055 --> 21:32.387
over the last 5,000 years or so.

21:33.025 --> 21:37.223
As such, there are a number
of rather interesting artifacts

21:37.329 --> 21:39.297
currently on the market.

21:40.599 --> 21:44.296
Anyway, that isn't the issue.
The question is, what's it worth?

21:44.403 --> 21:47.839
Well, the Ancients aren't exactly known
for secret stashes of gold,

21:47.940 --> 21:49.874
Iike these, for example.

21:52.578 --> 21:53.909
Wait a minute.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.743
These markings are Goa'uld,
the treasure's supposed to be Ancient.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.111
What do they have to do with this?

21:58.217 --> 22:00.708
These are actually
only loosely related to the tablet.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.879
-Yeah, how?
-You ever heard of the Goa'uld Nut?

22:05.124 --> 22:08.218
As in cashew? Pea?

22:08.994 --> 22:11.087
-Oh, you mean the Egyptian sky goddess.
-Yes.

22:11.196 --> 22:12.857
-No, never heard of her.
-These were her

22:12.965 --> 22:14.523
ceremonial marriage bracelets.

22:14.633 --> 22:16.692
She wore one and her husband
of the moment wore one.

22:16.802 --> 22:19.464
-"Of the moment"?
-Yes. She had many.

22:19.571 --> 22:21.835
It's one of the few
admirable things about her.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.671
What are you doing?

22:27.413 --> 22:28.641
Security.

22:32.618 --> 22:34.711
Okay, that was fun. Now take it off.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.414
-Not until we find the treasure.
-What?

22:37.523 --> 22:40.856
These bracelets link us together.

22:41.293 --> 22:44.820
The tablet is mine, and I want
my fair share of what it leads to.

I'm not gonna be able to cut it off...
The hand.

23:08.754 --> 23:11.382
If we remove the hand...
Now, I know that on first blush

23:11.490 --> 23:13.583
that doesn't sound like a viable option,
but I understand

23:13.692 --> 23:16.024
that Dr. Bennet is becoming
quite proficient at reattaching...

23:16.128 --> 23:18.926
I thought SG-12 checked
everything she had on her.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.931
(STAMMERlNG) They did.
And in their defense,

23:22.034 --> 23:24.867
at that time the bracelet wasn't giving off
any kind of energy signature.

23:24.970 --> 23:27.734
I mean, even now, it's barely measurable.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.208
So, what's it doing?
I mean, how does it work?

23:30.309 --> 23:33.335
Well... I don't know.

23:36.281 --> 23:38.909
No, no, I just need a little more time.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.484
I'll find out.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.786
Hey, are you okay?

23:56.301 --> 23:57.825
Come to torture me?

23:59.338 --> 24:00.862
How old are you?

24:02.941 --> 24:05.876
Mental abuse won't work either.

24:06.545 --> 24:08.342
I have a daughter about your age.

24:08.447 --> 24:12.110
Hasn't listened to me since she was 12.
Doesn't matter what I say or do.

24:12.217 --> 24:14.412
You're not going to bore me
with your personal life, are you?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.488
I have to admit an hour or two of that
might break me.

24:16.588 --> 24:18.681
I don't like being deceived!

24:20.225 --> 24:22.284
I'm not here to hurt anyone.

24:22.394 --> 24:25.329
And I really do hope this leads
to something fabulous for all of us,

24:25.430 --> 24:26.863
but it's not easy out there.

24:26.965 --> 24:30.366
I'm sure you can appreciate that a girl has
to do what a girl has to do to survive...

24:30.469 --> 24:33.768
I'm about as interested
in your sob story as you are in mine.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.537
I just want you to know
that Dr. Jackson is the one

24:36.642 --> 24:38.872
who recommended
I let you through the gate.

24:38.977 --> 24:42.640
He thought there was a chance that
what you had to offer might be legitimate.

24:42.748 --> 24:46.081
And he's the one with an alien device

24:46.185 --> 24:48.050
now stuck on his wrist.

24:48.453 --> 24:50.080
How this plays out

24:50.522 --> 24:53.082
and what you get out of it in the end

24:53.192 --> 24:55.660
I'm gonna leave entirely up to him.

24:56.094 --> 24:57.789
So if I were you...

25:14.780 --> 25:15.940

25:21.753 --> 25:23.220
How you doing?

25:24.223 --> 25:25.815
Fine, I think.

25:27.426 --> 25:30.691
-I don't know what happened. I was...
-It's the bracelet.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.929
-They are called kor mak.
-I figured he might know.

25:37.135 --> 25:41.435
Yeah, she said they were some sort
of weird Goa'uld Nut marriage thing.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.373
-I do not believe that to be the case.
-No?

25:44.676 --> 25:47.042
-No.
-Should've known.

25:47.145 --> 25:50.478
I have only heard of them in passing
a very long time ago.

25:50.582 --> 25:53.847
I believe it was Cronus who used
this technology when a prisoner of value

25:53.952 --> 25:56.750
needed to be transported
by one of his Jaffa.

25:56.855 --> 25:59.756
He would affix a bracelet
such as this to both the prisoner

25:59.858 --> 26:01.792
and the Jaffa responsible for him.

26:01.893 --> 26:05.158
If they became separated
for more than a short period of time

26:05.264 --> 26:08.529
-they would both become ill and die.
-Both?

26:08.967 --> 26:12.368
That's just about the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

26:15.340 --> 26:17.831
-You didn't know?
-Well, I knew it would make you sick.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.070
I didn't know it would have
the same effect on me, too.

26:20.178 --> 26:21.543
How could you not know?

26:21.647 --> 26:25.105
Because the person I stole it from
didn't tell me that part!

26:25.984 --> 26:27.076
(EXCLAlMS)

26:31.556 --> 26:32.784
Question.

26:33.458 --> 26:36.427
Why would the Goa'uld
design these things that way?

26:36.561 --> 26:39.325
To punish the Jaffa for his incompetence.

26:39.564 --> 26:41.054
Right, of course.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.825
Can you take it off?

26:42.934 --> 26:45.562
I am sorry, Daniel Jackson. As I have said,

26:45.671 --> 26:47.832
I've only heard
of this technology in passing.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.840
Please tell me you know
how to take this off.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.410
Yes, of course I do. I mean...

26:55.681 --> 26:58.047
That's assuming
that the person I stole them from

26:58.150 --> 27:00.209
was honest about that part.

27:00.419 --> 27:03.388
-Just do it.
-All right.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.452
As soon as we find the treasure
and I get my fair share.

27:07.559 --> 27:09.390
Okay, just to clarify,

27:10.028 --> 27:11.928
when I kill her, I die?

27:13.231 --> 27:15.631
Just as if you left her proximity.

27:17.235 --> 27:19.829
Or we could just find the treasure.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.673
The Daedalus left two hours ago.

27:26.011 --> 27:27.137
Sorry.

27:30.716 --> 27:33.480
Look, the tablet is written
in Ancient code, right?

27:33.585 --> 27:36.076
I know it's not the Lost City of Atlantis
we're looking for here,

27:36.188 --> 27:39.954
but whatever it is could be worth finding.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.097
Or you're just gonna have
to marry that chick.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.997
Yeah. Let's make babies.

27:56.475 --> 27:58.568
Are you sure you have this cipher right?

27:58.677 --> 27:59.905
Yes. Why?

28:00.479 --> 28:03.175
I can't believe
I missed the Daedalus for this.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.111
Get over it.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.115
You don't have to get back to Dakara?

28:09.221 --> 28:11.951
The Council is in recess until tomorrow.

28:12.424 --> 28:15.120
-Curious?
-lndeed.

28:15.594 --> 28:17.824
See? This is good, isn't it?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.464
Being part of a team again,
working together

28:20.565 --> 28:22.965
to unravel some cool Ancient mystery.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.026
Right, so we're not working together.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.566
But any minute now,
I bet Dr. Jackson discovers

28:28.673 --> 28:32.074
some key piece of information
that sets us off on a great adventure.

28:32.177 --> 28:33.644
This can't be right.

28:34.946 --> 28:36.311
What is it?

28:36.481 --> 28:38.472
This is a portion of the database

28:38.583 --> 28:40.574
the Atlantis expedition
brought back with them a few weeks ago.

28:40.685 --> 28:42.949
Specifically it's a log
of the names of the Ancients

28:43.054 --> 28:44.578
who left the planet
when it was under siege

28:44.689 --> 28:46.782
from the Wraith and returned to Earth.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.656
-Thousands of years ago.
-Yes.

28:49.761 --> 28:51.626
And what does this have to do
with the tablet?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.357
See, the tablet talks about a treasure,

28:53.465 --> 28:55.729
but it doesn't make
any specific reference at all to where it is.

28:55.834 --> 28:58.064
Well, it is supposed to be here.

28:58.170 --> 29:01.003
That's what the person
who I stole it from told me.

29:02.874 --> 29:04.637
Before I stole it from him.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.234
Well, I think it is here,
and I think I know where it is, too.

29:07.345 --> 29:10.178
All right, time-out.
If the tablet doesn't say...

29:10.282 --> 29:11.909
It doesn't say specifically,

29:12.017 --> 29:15.885
but it is signed by a guy named Myrddin.

29:21.393 --> 29:22.655
Never heard of him.

29:22.761 --> 29:27.164
I think you have. And the amazing part is,
his name also appears in the database.

29:27.632 --> 29:29.190
The Ancient who carved this tablet

29:29.301 --> 29:31.599
is one of the Ancients
who returned to Earth from Atlantis?

29:31.703 --> 29:32.727
Yes.

29:33.004 --> 29:34.835
I have an Uncle Marvin

29:34.940 --> 29:38.000
and I'm pretty sure
I don't know any Myrddins.

29:38.343 --> 29:40.834
That's because his name in English
sounds a little different.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.914
Have you heard of Merlin?

29:43.415 --> 29:44.609
Merlin?

29:44.716 --> 29:47.651
King Arthur and
the Knights of the Round Table Merlin?

29:47.752 --> 29:49.185
-Yes.
-Was an Ancient?

29:49.287 --> 29:50.652
I think so.

29:51.323 --> 29:54.315
See? That is what I'm talking about.

30:01.833 --> 30:04.233
Arthur was then carried off
in a barge by Merlin,

30:04.336 --> 30:06.133
saying that he was headed
for the vale of Avalon,

30:06.238 --> 30:08.934
which according to legend was a
magical place where the dead would meet.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.905
Now, at the time some
said Arthur never actually died,

30:11.009 --> 30:12.977
but would, in fact, one day return.

30:13.078 --> 30:15.672
From what we know about the Ancients
it's possible

30:15.780 --> 30:19.477
that Avalon was actually a place where
Merlin helped Arthur, a mortal, ascend.

30:19.584 --> 30:23.315
Are not the Ancients prevented from
interfering with the existence of mortals?

30:23.421 --> 30:24.854
Ascended Ancients. Yes, for the most part.

30:24.956 --> 30:28.016
But it's possible Merlin
was not actually ascended himself,

30:28.126 --> 30:30.822
but was, in fact, just a human
far along the evolutionary path.

30:30.929 --> 30:34.057
What does this have to do
with where this alleged treasure is buried?

30:34.165 --> 30:35.860
Well, there are a number
of conflicting interpretations,

30:35.967 --> 30:38.299
but certain threads point
to the Knights of the Round Table.

30:38.403 --> 30:40.871
Gathering great treasures
from the far corners of Arthur's domain

30:40.972 --> 30:43.065
and hiding them in a magical stronghold
at Avalon.

30:43.174 --> 30:46.143
-lncluding the Holy Grail.
-According to some.

30:46.244 --> 30:49.179
So this grail, what's that worth?

30:52.851 --> 30:53.909
What?

30:54.386 --> 30:56.217
In 1 191, the monks at Glastonbury Abbey

30:56.321 --> 30:58.221
claimed to have found
the grave of King Arthur.

30:58.323 --> 31:00.757
On the stone burial was an inlay lead cross
with the inscription...

31:00.859 --> 31:02.486
(READlNG lN LATlN)

31:03.962 --> 31:06.590
"Here lies the famous King Arthur
buried on the isle of Avalon."

31:06.698 --> 31:08.666
Now, the claim was not taken seriously
until 1278

31:08.767 --> 31:10.928
when Henry ll ordered
the grave to be exhumed.

31:11.036 --> 31:14.403
Now, Glastonbury, a small town
about 125 miles west of London

31:14.506 --> 31:16.303
has been a pilgrimage for believers since.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.399
Yes, yes. And the point is?

31:18.510 --> 31:21.274
Certain Celtic legends says
that Glastonbury Tor,

31:21.513 --> 31:23.504
the hill overlooking the town,
is actually hollow

31:23.615 --> 31:26.243
and that contained within it
is the entrance to the underworld Avalon.

31:26.351 --> 31:28.751
Has no one ever done
any sort of geological survey?

31:28.853 --> 31:30.514
There've been several
scientific studies apparently...

31:30.622 --> 31:31.816
Jackson, l...

31:31.923 --> 31:33.550
We're talking about the Ancients here, sir.

31:33.658 --> 31:35.626
It's very possible
that the underground entrance

31:35.727 --> 31:37.786
was concealed
with some sort of technology.

31:37.896 --> 31:41.855
Sir, we're hoping to use the Asgard
sensors aboard the Prometheus

31:41.967 --> 31:44.458
to find something
we haven't been able to see before.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.866
Thank you.

31:46.638 --> 31:51.371
Well, two years ago, I wouldn't have
believed we'd find an Ancient outpost

31:51.476 --> 31:53.876
under a mile of ice in Antarctica.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.675
I'll call the President.

31:57.082 --> 32:00.848
I'm sure he'll want to inform
the British Prime Minister.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.890
That was fantastic. You talk to Carter yet?

32:06.992 --> 32:09.552
-Yeah. She can't make it.
-What?

32:09.861 --> 32:12.352
This is huge, we could be
on the brink of another major discovery

32:12.464 --> 32:13.658
of Ancient technology here.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.563
I'm sure she'll be interested
in whatever we find.

32:18.503 --> 32:20.994
Hey, try playing hard to get.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.708
Well, look who's talking.

32:30.849 --> 32:33.113
So what do you reckon
the range of these things is?

32:33.218 --> 32:35.948
Well, Dr. Lee seems to think
we need to stay within 100 feet or so,

32:36.054 --> 32:38.955
more than half an hour outside that
boundary we'll begin to feel the effects.

32:39.057 --> 32:40.388
You know, if we do find something,

32:40.492 --> 32:42.687
I think maybe Teal'c and l
should check it out.

32:42.794 --> 32:46.025
I missed the Daedalus because of this.
If we find a secret Ancient base, I'm going.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.361
That means we gotta take her with us.

32:50.201 --> 32:53.762
-Good point.
-Look, I want you there. You know that.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.600
I'm just thinking
we could stay in radio contact.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.175
HARRIMAN ON PA:
Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell, please report

32:58.276 --> 33:00.642
to auxiliary control room two.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.784
-Now, this brings back memories.
-How's that?

33:10.889 --> 33:13.357
-lsn't this where I beat you up?
-No.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.256
No, I'm pretty sure that right there
is where I crushed your...

33:16.361 --> 33:18.420
All right, excuse me, kids.

33:18.630 --> 33:22.327
-Marks, what you got?
-Well, thanks to the Asgard sensors,

33:24.502 --> 33:26.800
we were able to map
around the energy distortion

33:26.905 --> 33:29.430
that would have normally fooled
deep-ground sonar.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.441
I was able to define a large main cavern,

33:31.543 --> 33:34.034
a network of tunnels
and some smaller caves.

33:34.312 --> 33:36.007
Well done, Lieutenant.

33:36.114 --> 33:37.843
Can you see what's in there?

33:37.949 --> 33:40.577
Say, large piles of precious metals?

33:42.320 --> 33:46.120
Like I said, we could only map
the exterior of the structure.

33:46.324 --> 33:48.519
Can you get us in there?

33:49.294 --> 33:53.788
It's almost a half-mile underground and
there's no visible access from the surface.

33:53.898 --> 33:55.331
Asgard beams.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.791
Tried that. Doesn't seem to penetrate

33:57.902 --> 34:00.462
whatever sort of energy shield
is disguising the caves.

34:00.572 --> 34:01.732
Rings.

34:04.109 --> 34:05.940
The Ancients
were the gate builders, right?

34:06.044 --> 34:07.534
And they invented the rings, too.

34:07.645 --> 34:09.340
They had to get in and out
of there somehow,

34:09.447 --> 34:10.812
and I know this ship has rings...

34:10.915 --> 34:12.940
Yeah, yeah, good times.
She's right, though.

34:13.051 --> 34:17.147
If there are rings down there
we should be able to lock on.

34:17.455 --> 34:19.218
But your radios won't work.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.819
Looks like we're all going.

34:25.263 --> 34:27.128
You'll be on your own.

34:28.166 --> 34:29.599
Ladies first.

34:30.602 --> 34:32.365
Well, then after you.

34:37.008 --> 34:39.101
Come on. This is fun, right?

34:51.623 --> 34:52.851
MlTCHELL: Be quick!

34:54.526 --> 34:56.084
And empty.

34:56.694 --> 35:00.391
(SlGHlNG) I haven't been this disappointed
since Daniel and I had sex.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.973
A sword in a stone.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.275
What's that supposed to mean?

35:18.917 --> 35:21.784
Well, King Arthur
once pulled a sword from a stone

35:21.886 --> 35:24.184
as proof of his righteousness and loyalty.

35:24.289 --> 35:27.258
-Excalibur.
-Actually, that's a common misconception.

35:27.358 --> 35:29.849
See, Excalibur was forged
by the Lady of the Lake at Avalon,

35:29.961 --> 35:31.428
but it wasn't given to King Arthur

35:31.529 --> 35:34.987
until after the sword
he pulled from the stone broke in battle.

35:48.947 --> 35:51.575
Give it a try, muscles. I'll give you half.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.051
Okay, yeah.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.714
Yeah, it's in there pretty good.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.822
Welcome, ye Knights of the Round Table,

36:06.664 --> 36:10.964
men of honor,
followers of the path of righteousness.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.037
Only those with wealth of knowledge

36:15.974 --> 36:20.377
and truth of spirit
shall be given access to the underworld,

36:21.746 --> 36:26.342
the storehouse of riches
of Ambrosius Aurelianus.

36:27.352 --> 36:32.221
Prove ye worthy, and all shall be revealed.

36:32.323 --> 36:33.950
That's incredible.

36:37.328 --> 36:38.590
Certain scholars have speculated

36:38.696 --> 36:41.062
that Ambrosius and Arthur
are one and the same,

36:41.165 --> 36:44.965
but that would've made him
74 years old at the Battle of Mount Badon.

36:45.069 --> 36:46.263
It's actually quite fascinating.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.532
See, Ambrosius was the son
of the emperor...

36:48.640 --> 36:52.167
Yes, yes, yes.
Fascinating is the one thing it's not.

36:52.277 --> 36:55.212
How do we prove ye worthy
and get all to be revealed?

36:55.313 --> 36:58.714
JACKSON: I have no idea,
but something tells me truth of spirit

36:58.816 --> 37:01.216
-might be a problem for you.
-You know nothing about me.

37:01.319 --> 37:03.014
'Cause everything that comes
out of your mouth is a lie.

37:03.121 --> 37:05.385
Don't make me separate you two.

37:07.458 --> 37:09.517
Perhaps there's something
in these tunnels.

37:09.627 --> 37:12.255
See, that is why he's here.

37:13.264 --> 37:16.256
Genius. We're gonna split up.
I'm with Teal'c.

37:16.634 --> 37:18.226
Yo, wait up.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.313
I guess it would've been too easy for them

37:31.416 --> 37:34.283
to just leave their stuff laying
out in the open.

37:38.323 --> 37:39.756
Maybe it's just me,

37:40.825 --> 37:44.261
but I'm digging this rapport
developing between the two of us.

37:46.197 --> 37:48.461
VALA: You should give me a weapon.
JACKSON: Nope.

37:48.566 --> 37:50.397
There could be some sort of icky creature
down here

37:50.501 --> 37:51.900
Ieft behind to protect the treasure.

37:52.003 --> 37:55.097
-For hundreds of years?
-Some sort of stasis or hibernation.

37:55.206 --> 37:58.300
What if it senses our presence
and awakens hungry for human flesh?

37:58.409 --> 38:00.070
That doesn't quite sound
like an Ancients' style.

38:00.178 --> 38:01.145
Still.

38:01.245 --> 38:02.576
I'm sure if there is a monster down here

38:02.680 --> 38:04.978
it's gonna be much more scared of you
than you are of it.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.278
Especially once it gets to know you.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.425
(EXPLOSlONS)

38:43.054 --> 38:44.521
Check this out.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.488
(RUMBLlNG)

38:57.235 --> 38:59.203
Okay, that can't be good.

39:00.905 --> 39:02.532
Jackson, come in.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.378
Jackson, can you hear me?

39:15.153 --> 39:17.587
If you immediately know
that candlelight is fire...

39:17.688 --> 39:19.451
-Huh?
-Nothing.

39:23.061 --> 39:24.494
(RUMBLlNG)

39:38.409 --> 39:42.072
Okay, the hologram said that only those
with a wealth of knowledge

39:42.180 --> 39:44.273
and truth of spirit will pass.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.748
This has to be a test.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.478
What does it say?

39:50.988 --> 39:53.081
It says, "The universe is infinite."

39:53.191 --> 39:56.558
That seems infinitely not useful.
How about this one?

39:56.928 --> 39:59.590
-"The treasure is in this pot."
-Really?

40:00.465 --> 40:03.957
I was hoping for something
a little more substantial, but okay.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.535
No, wait! Wait!

40:05.636 --> 40:07.900
-Too obvious?
-Give me a minute.

40:10.341 --> 40:11.774
Not a minute.

40:12.443 --> 40:13.811
Still not a minute.

40:13.811 --> 40:14.106
Still not a minute.

40:15.513 --> 40:16.810
All right.

40:17.181 --> 40:21.447
I am assuming this is some kind of puzzle.

40:22.553 --> 40:24.282
Can you read this writing?

40:30.461 --> 40:31.450
No.

40:34.031 --> 40:38.092
Well, I think we're supposed to arrange
the stones in some sort of order.

40:38.202 --> 40:39.635
What do you think?

40:42.874 --> 40:46.002
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man!

40:47.044 --> 40:48.773
Bullets bounce!

41:07.098 --> 41:10.090
Okay, how about this?
We open both of them,

41:10.201 --> 41:11.828
whichever one the treasure's in
is the right one.

41:11.936 --> 41:13.733
No, I think that's the wrong idea.
There's two pots here.

41:13.838 --> 41:16.432
I think the point of the exercise
is to only open one pot.

41:16.541 --> 41:17.838
This says, "Treasure is inside."

41:17.942 --> 41:19.466
Right. Which makes it
the obvious first choice.

41:19.577 --> 41:20.908
-So over to the gold!
-No.

41:21.012 --> 41:23.105
-Back to the silver, then.
-Don't!

41:24.182 --> 41:25.376
It's empty.

41:28.686 --> 41:31.849
There's nothing I hate
more than a bold-faced lie.

41:33.591 --> 41:36.151
-Okay...
-Would you stop!

41:36.260 --> 41:39.661
What? We're already trapped in here.
How much worse can it get?

41:39.830 --> 41:41.525
(RUMBLlNG)

41:47.939 --> 41:49.338
How about that much?

41:49.440 --> 41:51.465
I knew it was a mistake
the moment I said it.

41:51.576 --> 41:52.565
The moment.

42:02.620 --> 42:03.678
Okay.

42:04.589 --> 42:06.056
That didn't work.

42:07.592 --> 42:09.184
(RUMBLlNG)

42:10.628 --> 42:11.788
Indeed.

42:14.065 --> 42:16.033
Oh, come on.

42:23.174 --> 42:25.438
-This one's empty, too.
-I know.

42:25.610 --> 42:27.669
-That doesn't make sense.
-I know!

42:28.346 --> 42:29.711
Colonel Mitchell!

42:33.417 --> 42:36.909
Two down, and only a billion
possible combinations to go.

42:37.021 --> 42:39.717
Are you still having fun, Colonel Mitchell?

42:39.824 --> 42:41.758
-So, what do we do?
-I don't know.

42:41.859 --> 42:43.349
You don't know?

42:43.461 --> 42:46.760
So now is a bad time to tell you
that I hate small spaces?

42:48.799 --> 42:51.097
Do you ever get a bad feeling
about something?
