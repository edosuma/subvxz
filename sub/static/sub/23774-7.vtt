This is all she offers?

00:08.670 --> 00:10.124
Well you sound
disappointed.

00:10.330 --> 00:12.124
I feel unappreciated,
yes!

00:12.420 --> 00:13.721
I offer thousands!

00:13.920 --> 00:15.348
No, tens of thousands!

00:15.500 --> 00:18.040
Hundreds of thousands of able
bodied men and women!

00:18.203 --> 00:20.170
And she thinks I will
march back home

00:20.170 --> 00:22.131
and flaunt for the

What was that?

00:29.895 --> 00:32.172
Naqada, Naqada?

00:32.291 --> 00:33.029
Yes, I heard.

00:33.054 --> 00:33.942
What does it mean?

00:34.410 --> 00:37.830
Well, Naqada was a city
in ancient Egypt,

00:37.830 --> 00:39.580
also known as Nbwt.

00:39.580 --> 00:41.750
It was the center
of their civilization.

01:05.221 --> 01:06.396
No Naqada.

01:06.491 --> 01:07.875
Yes, yes this is
very nice.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.185
Do I get this as well?

Eternal youth and

02:04.871 --> 02:08.117
Youth and beauty,

Imagine the power to grant
eternal youth, or life.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.099
Don't look so worried,

02:28.496 --> 02:31.226
perhaps I will grant you the
gift of immortality

familiar to you?

You must be joking.

03:00.565 --> 03:01.379
Sorry.

03:02.851 --> 03:04.385
It does look a lot
like Egypt.

03:05.425 --> 03:06.560
Not the food.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.182
How are you doing this?

03:23.928 --> 03:26.247
It's remarkably similar
to Ancient Egyptian.

03:26.645 --> 03:30.448
Once Wasif told me the Coptic
vowel placement to listen for.

03:31.506 --> 03:32.247
Try this.

03:32.794 --> 03:34.686
[laughing] No it's good.

03:40.710 --> 03:42.750
Imagining what the language
of the pharaohs

03:42.750 --> 03:45.035
would've sounded like has long
been a passion of his.

03:47.492 --> 03:48.484
Looks like it paid off.

03:49.660 --> 03:50.375
Funny.

04:02.420 --> 04:03.954
would understand the

Oh, Wasif.

05:02.805 --> 05:04.980

- Wasif.

05:06.085 --> 05:08.513
He knew enough to open the
gate in the first place.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.891
It's not crazy to think he knew
what he may have found here.

05:14.425 --> 05:18.231
There are glyphs in here that
I've never seen before,

05:18.637 --> 05:20.407
Which believe me,
is rare.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.960
What if I've never seen
these before because

05:49.960 --> 05:53.788
they depict what happened
here on this world, not ours?
