00:01.002 --> 00:03.046
Announcer: Due to the explicit
sexual nature

00:03.213 --> 00:05.882
of the following
National Lampoon Radio Hour,

00:06.049 --> 00:08.593
it is featured as adult
entertainment

00:08.760 --> 00:11.054
and not recommended
for children's ears

00:11.221 --> 00:13.056
without parental supervision.

00:13.223 --> 00:17.268
Tonight's show will begin
after this brief commercial word.

00:17.519 --> 00:19.562
John Belushi: Good evening, uh,
this is John Belushi

00:19.729 --> 00:21.981
and this is the
National Lampoon Radio Hour.

00:22.148 --> 00:25.151
- [music] (music plays) [music]
- (applause)

00:32.534 --> 00:34.094
- Boy: Hi, Dad.
- Man: Hello there, son,

00:34.202 --> 00:35.203
how was school today?

00:35.370 --> 00:36.705
Boy: Okay. Hey, I heard
a really neat joke

00:36.871 --> 00:38.039
at recess, you wanna hear it?

00:38.206 --> 00:39.249
Man: Why, certainly, son.
Go ahead.

00:39.416 --> 00:40.834
Boy: Okay. Well, you see,
there was this priest

00:41.000 --> 00:42.669
and this minister and this...
Wait, what do you call it...

00:42.836 --> 00:44.596
Rabbi, yeah.
And they were in this car and...

00:44.754 --> 00:46.674
Man: Hold it right there, son.
Around this house,

00:46.715 --> 00:48.633
we don't make jokes
about religion, do we?

00:48.800 --> 00:50.640
Boy: Aw, but gee, Dad,
it's a really cute joke.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.262
Man: Don't "Aw, gee" me, son.

00:52.429 --> 00:54.472
You start off with
cute jokes about religion,

00:54.681 --> 00:56.266
and you end up
with atheistic trash

00:56.433 --> 00:58.685
like this December issue
of the National Lampoon.

00:58.852 --> 01:01.771
It makes fun of saints and prayers
and money and all that's sacred.

01:01.938 --> 01:04.524
This issue of the National Lampoon
is foul and repulsive,

01:04.774 --> 01:07.610
and this is where your cute
little jokes will lead you, son.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.571
Boy: Okay, Dad, I'm...
I'm sorry.

01:09.738 --> 01:11.573
Man: That's all right, son,
you're forgiven.

01:12.031 --> 01:13.575
- Man: Oh, and son?
- Boy: Yes, Dad.

01:13.825 --> 01:15.285
Man: You'll be sleeping
with your mother tonight.

01:15.452 --> 01:16.995
It's my turn with your sister.

01:17.454 --> 01:19.998

Billy Bob Thornton:
I had this sense of humor

01:48.902 --> 01:52.155
that sort of didn't exist
where I grew up.

01:52.614 --> 01:54.157
[music] (music continues) [music]

01:54.324 --> 01:56.368
After reading that first
National Lampoon,

01:56.534 --> 01:59.787
I went, "Wow, that's what
I've been trying to say."

02:02.582 --> 02:04.709
National Lampoon
just meant a lot to me as a kid

02:04.876 --> 02:06.586
because it was
what I wanted to do.

02:06.753 --> 02:09.380
It woke me up to the idea
that this was a job.

02:09.547 --> 02:12.383
Fat, drunk and stupid is
no way to go through life, son.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.470
Judd Apatow: And then you get
all these generations afterwards

02:15.804 --> 02:19.140
of people like me who were
just trying to be those guys.

02:21.017 --> 02:23.812
It was sharp, crystal clear,
and above all funny.

02:25.104 --> 02:27.065
It just blew
the whole shit house up.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.609
[music] (music continues) [music]

02:33.780 --> 02:39.285
The National Lampoon was
defining part of the zeitgeist.

02:41.120 --> 02:45.416
Here was this totally
outrageous voice

02:45.583 --> 02:49.921
that was screaming,
"Here I come."

02:50.088 --> 02:53.299
[music] (music continues) [music]

02:55.510 --> 02:58.555
Breasts... I would try
to seek out the magazine

02:58.721 --> 03:01.266
on the off chance that
there would be some breasts.

03:01.432 --> 03:05.353
[music] (music continues) [music]

03:05.520 --> 03:08.898
Kevin Bacon: The humor was
a little bit above my pay grade.

03:09.274 --> 03:11.150
(chuckling)

03:12.110 --> 03:14.779
Meatball: The Lampoons
are very intellectual.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.906
Tennessee Williams
and Arthur Miller

03:17.073 --> 03:19.367
could have been part
of National Lampoon.

03:19.534 --> 03:22.579
We were taking on the idiocy

03:23.288 --> 03:25.164
of our own generation.

03:25.331 --> 03:27.500
You know, overthrowing the ageist,
racist, sexist,

03:27.667 --> 03:30.253
corporate pig monster
is a full-time job.

03:32.005 --> 03:34.090
They always had
the best parties,

03:34.340 --> 03:37.343
the best drugs,
the smartest people.

03:41.848 --> 03:43.016
We could sell out more,

03:43.892 --> 03:46.853
and the moment
we do sell out totally,

03:48.229 --> 03:49.355
we'll be dead.

03:49.522 --> 03:53.443
[music] (music continues) [music]

04:06.956 --> 04:08.750
There's a time
in everyone's life,

04:09.542 --> 04:12.962
and it's really
between 17 and 22,

04:13.129 --> 04:15.590
when you talk to people
in their middle age,

04:15.757 --> 04:17.716
they always talk
about their high school

04:17.884 --> 04:20.303
or their college experience
as the, quote unquote,

04:20.470 --> 04:22.055
"Best years of their lives."

04:22.305 --> 04:23.806
And I'm thinking, "Well, why?"

04:23.973 --> 04:28.603
And ultimately it's because,
when you're 17, 18,

04:28.770 --> 04:32.774
you were expected to function
as an adult, but you're a baby.

04:33.566 --> 04:35.086
Have you ever gone
to a college campus?

04:35.109 --> 04:36.194
Those kids are babies.

04:36.361 --> 04:37.904
But they're adults,

04:38.071 --> 04:41.491
so there's this wonderful
freedom, sense of adventure.

04:41.866 --> 04:45.119
"We can do anything we want!
We're college students!"

04:45.453 --> 04:47.413
And that's really
how the whole thing started.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.959
[music] (piano plays) [music]

04:51.125 --> 04:54.337
[music] Fight fiercely, Harvard
fight, fight, fight [music]

04:54.504 --> 04:57.215
[music] Impress them
with our prowess do [music]

04:57.382 --> 04:58.466
Meatloaf:
What was it originally,

04:58.633 --> 04:59.968
the Harvard Lampoon, right?

05:00.134 --> 05:01.636
Well, anybody that
mentioned Harvard,

05:01.803 --> 05:03.805
I just went, "Fuck you."

05:04.180 --> 05:06.808
The Harvard Lampoon
was one of those famous things

05:06.975 --> 05:08.393
that nobody has
ever seen a copy of.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.079
[music] Fight, fight, fight... [music]

05:10.103 --> 05:11.229
Mike Reiss:
The Harvard Lampoon is

05:11.396 --> 05:13.189
America's oldest humor magazine

05:13.356 --> 05:16.442
started at Harvard in 1876.

05:16.609 --> 05:18.194
Man: John Updike was an editor,

05:18.361 --> 05:20.363
and George Plimpton was
an editor.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.490
Well, that's about it, you know?

05:22.949 --> 05:25.827
Two famous writers in 125 years.

05:26.369 --> 05:29.247
And we also had Fred Gwynne, the
guy who played Herman Munster.

05:29.539 --> 05:31.541
It goes
off the table after that.

05:31.708 --> 05:35.045
[music] Fight, fight, fight [music]

05:35.503 --> 05:38.214
Harvard Lampoon was just
this extracurricular activity

05:38.381 --> 05:40.049
and was something
you did before you went

05:40.216 --> 05:43.136
into the family law firm
or became a banker.

05:47.390 --> 05:50.852
Doug Kenney and Henry Beard were
in the class after I left Harvard.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.979
They were both incredibly brilliant,

05:53.146 --> 05:56.941
and incredibly funny
and incredibly good friends,

05:57.108 --> 05:58.735
but they weren't the same at all.

06:04.782 --> 06:07.243
Doug Kenney was really the heart
and soul of the Lampoon.

06:07.410 --> 06:10.663
Doug was the, sort of, the complete
social opposite of Henry.

06:10.830 --> 06:13.124
For one thing, he did not come
from an upper-crust family.

06:13.291 --> 06:15.960
Doug's father was the tennis pro

06:16.127 --> 06:19.255
at a golf club
in Chagrin Falls, Ohio.

06:19.797 --> 06:21.674
Have you ever seen Caddyshack?
That's Doug.

06:22.425 --> 06:23.885
- You take drugs, Danny?
- Every day.

06:24.052 --> 06:25.178
Good.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.013
Tony Hendra:
The very first time I met Doug,

06:27.180 --> 06:29.891
he was talking like
William Makepeace Thackeray.

06:30.058 --> 06:33.395
I mean, he was actually
improvising his prose, right?

06:33.561 --> 06:35.354
And it was Thackeray,
it wasn't Dickens.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.691
And about 30,
45 seconds after that,

06:38.858 --> 06:41.819
he was demonstrating that he could
put his entire fist in his mouth.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.072
So this was Doug, you know?

06:44.447 --> 06:46.658
Sean Kelly: Doug was a performer.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.409
Doug wanted to be a star.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.411
And he was a smart, funny,

06:50.578 --> 06:52.497
complicated person
who could write.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.415
Now that's, uh, that's rare.

07:07.887 --> 07:09.847
Bruce McCall: Henry was probably
the smartest man I ever met.

07:10.014 --> 07:11.265
He could have been
a nuclear physicist,

07:11.432 --> 07:12.767
he could have been
a Supreme Court judge,

07:12.934 --> 07:14.054
he could have been anything.

07:14.185 --> 07:17.146
Kelly: I remember the first time
Henry met my first wife.

07:17.313 --> 07:20.066
Afterwards she said,
"I've met Holden Caulfield."

07:21.609 --> 07:23.069
Henry Beard: My father
had graduated from Yale,

07:23.236 --> 07:25.488
and as a...
a bit of youthful rebellion,

07:25.655 --> 07:26.990
I decided to go to Harvard.

07:27.782 --> 07:31.035
Henry is about as private
a person as you'll ever find.

07:31.202 --> 07:34.247
He was mysterious and elusive.

07:34.580 --> 07:38.167
The two of them together were
an absolutely amazing team.

07:38.334 --> 07:40.837
When I was at Harvard,
we got a call one day

07:41.003 --> 07:42.505
from Betsy Talbot Blackwell,

07:42.672 --> 07:45.716
who was the editor-in-chief
of Mademoiselle magazine.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.346
She had seen a parody issue

07:50.513 --> 07:52.181
that the Harvard Lampoon
had put out,

07:52.348 --> 07:54.225
and Betsy said,
"You know, maybe I should"

07:54.392 --> 07:56.644
"ask these guys
to do a parody of us,"

07:56.811 --> 07:59.063
"and we'll publish it
in our own magazine."

07:59.480 --> 08:03.693
She offered us $7,000 which
seemed like nothing even then,

08:03.860 --> 08:07.613
but what she also offered was
a free subscription ad.

08:09.782 --> 08:12.910
We could do anything we wanted
as long as we put the clothes in

08:13.244 --> 08:15.371
and as long as we showed
the models,

08:15.538 --> 08:18.124
which, of course,
led to a lot of good times.

08:19.584 --> 08:21.586
And as a result of that
parody issue,

08:21.752 --> 08:24.547
we got tens of thousands
of subscriptions right away.

08:24.964 --> 08:26.299
She gave us a national audience.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.261
The discovery is that,
rather than having

08:30.428 --> 08:34.347
to depend on Mademoiselle to
make our magazines go national...

08:36.808 --> 08:40.520
...the Harvard Lampoon could actually
publish national magazines itself.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.649
They did Time magazine,
and they did Sports Illustrated

08:43.816 --> 08:45.443
and they did Life magazine.

08:45.610 --> 08:48.905
Beard: Doug Kenney and I decided
to do a parody of Lord of the Rings.

08:49.739 --> 08:51.699
We sent a letter to Tolkien,
who, honest to God,

08:51.866 --> 08:54.535
sent a letter back saying, "Yeah
go right ahead, silly book."

08:54.869 --> 08:57.288
I like the Playboy parody
that they did

08:57.371 --> 09:02.126
where the centerfold girl was more
tan around her bottom and top.

09:02.835 --> 09:04.420
She had reversed tan lines.

09:06.297 --> 09:08.049
Playboy was
a big hit nationally,

09:08.216 --> 09:10.760
and Doug and Henry realized
that maybe there was some way

09:10.927 --> 09:13.429
that the National Lampoon
could exist.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.601
Radio Announcer: Uh-uh-uh,
don't touch that dial.

09:18.768 --> 09:20.937
The National Lampoon
will be right back

09:21.103 --> 09:23.231
after this insincere
commercial message

09:23.397 --> 09:25.191
written by some cynical Nazis,

09:25.358 --> 09:28.027
solely for the purpose of
ripping off your parents' money.

09:29.362 --> 09:31.489
I think if you take yourself
back to when you were

09:31.656 --> 09:35.201
in your 20s, all possibilities
appear open to anybody.

09:35.368 --> 09:38.079
You know, you could
go after anything at any time.

09:39.872 --> 09:42.750
P.J. O'Rourke: Doug and Henry
had gone to New York

09:42.917 --> 09:45.795
in hopes of doing a 50/50 deal
with some publishing group

09:45.962 --> 09:47.797
who would put up the money.

09:48.714 --> 09:51.175
See, we met with some guys
from Time and Life.

09:51.342 --> 09:53.636
I can't tell you how
off-putting they were.

09:53.803 --> 09:56.180
Just saying, "Oh, you guys,
you don't understand anything."

09:56.347 --> 09:58.307
"You don't have a chance.
You're toast."

09:58.474 --> 09:59.795
"You're just not going anywhere."

10:00.351 --> 10:02.853
Doug Kenney was not
very happy about that

10:03.020 --> 10:05.189
and said, "You people are
the kind of people"

10:05.356 --> 10:07.608
"who commute back and forth
from Westport, Connecticut,"

10:07.775 --> 10:08.859
"in a station wagon."

10:09.568 --> 10:11.028
"We have nothing to do
with you."

10:11.195 --> 10:13.656
I thought, "Holy God",
but he was right!

10:14.365 --> 10:16.784
And that's how we ran
into 21 st Century Communications

10:16.951 --> 10:18.202
and Matty Simmons.

10:18.369 --> 10:20.871
Matty Simmons: Doug Kenney,
Henry Beard, and Rob Hoffman,

10:21.038 --> 10:23.082
three Harvard Lampoon editors,

10:23.249 --> 10:26.669
came into my office,
and I was immediately impressed.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.717
Matty belonged
to another generation.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.803
Very much New York,
very much old-school publishing.

10:35.970 --> 10:37.170
Ellis Weiner:
This guy invented

10:37.263 --> 10:39.423
the Diners' Club card,
which was the first credit card.

10:39.557 --> 10:41.434
Jams Hirsch: I think he wished
he was in the Rat Pack.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.436
He, sort of,
always had those bedroom eyes.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.271
You'd be talking to him
about something serious,

10:45.438 --> 10:46.564
and he'd take a phone call and say,

10:46.731 --> 10:49.483
"Oh, yeah, darling, baby,
I love you so much, I love you.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.051
Yeah, broccoli for dinner's fine.
Yeah, thank you, good-bye."

10:52.653 --> 10:55.865
Beard: He was very full of himself,
knew the business inside out.

10:56.032 --> 10:58.492
Distribution in those days was,
you know,

10:58.659 --> 11:00.036
there were some
criminal elements.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.843
Matty wasn't one of them, but he
had to deal with people like that.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.793
O'Rourke:
Magazines in the late '60s

11:07.960 --> 11:11.005
were thought to take about five years
before they got into the black.

11:11.172 --> 11:14.467
Rob intuited that this would
either work or it wouldn't.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.302
So he made a bet
when he negotiated the deal.

11:17.470 --> 11:19.388
He did a forced buyout
after five years.

11:19.555 --> 11:21.349
It was, kind of, a gutsy move.

11:21.515 --> 11:24.101
Simmons:
They owned 25%, I owned 75%.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.687
And part of the deal was,
after five years,

11:26.812 --> 11:28.272
I would buy them out.

11:28.439 --> 11:29.940
If this magazine is successful,

11:30.107 --> 11:33.736
I might owe these guys five,
six million dollars,

11:33.903 --> 11:35.071
but I made the deal.

11:36.364 --> 11:38.407
And we started National Lampoon.

11:43.496 --> 11:45.373
Their first hire was
Michael O'Donoghue,

11:45.539 --> 11:47.500
and Michael O'Donoghue
was not Harvard,

11:47.666 --> 11:49.460
Michael O'Donoghue was Buffalo.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.281
[music] (T. Rex "Children of
the Revolution" plays) [music]

11:57.259 --> 11:58.928
Boy, was he an angry bunny.

12:00.930 --> 12:05.267
He probably as much as anyone
gave the Lampoon its tone.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.978
We're doing this in place
of hitting you in the face.

12:08.145 --> 12:11.440
He had this recipe box,
you know the ones that ladies have

12:11.607 --> 12:13.067
with the recipes in them?

12:13.234 --> 12:15.194
"Oh, baked beans..."

12:16.070 --> 12:20.783
But his recipe box was full of things
like battling buses of World War ll.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.493
He just had
hundreds of these things.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.143
Chris Cerf:
He would take any chance.

12:25.162 --> 12:28.082
Even though we were perfectly
happy to do tasteful things,

12:28.249 --> 12:30.292
he pushed the bounds
even further.

12:30.459 --> 12:32.044
Doug did the dirty stuff,
Henry did the brainy stuff,

12:32.211 --> 12:33.771
and O'Donoghue did
the outrageous stuff,

12:33.921 --> 12:35.214
the really transgressive stuff.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.731
Tony Hendra was a British comic

12:52.898 --> 12:55.192
as part of a comedy team
called Ullett and Hendra.

12:55.359 --> 12:58.445
He and his partner Nick Ullett
used to be on The Merv Griffin Show.

12:58.612 --> 13:01.866
When you hear the buzz,
it will be the correct time.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.993
(buzzes)

13:04.160 --> 13:05.744
It is now the correct time.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.037
(audience laughing)

13:07.204 --> 13:09.373
Tony Hendra: Writing for television
was like firing on one cylinder.

13:09.540 --> 13:13.961
Working at the Lampoon was like
firing on all six cylinders.

13:14.128 --> 13:16.338
It was like you could talk about
anything you wanted.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.674
There was absolutely
nothing that was,

13:18.841 --> 13:21.302
"You can't say that, Tony"
or "That's not funny, Tony."

13:21.469 --> 13:24.138
He had this extraordinarily
educated-at-Cambridge accent

13:24.305 --> 13:26.015
and was very literate
and worldly

13:26.182 --> 13:29.935
and yet behaved like
a delinquent of 12 or 13.

13:41.030 --> 13:43.115
I was a humble Canadian
schoolteacher.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.160
One day, my upstairs neighbor,
Michel Choquette,

13:46.327 --> 13:49.371
came home and told me he was
interested in starting to write

13:49.538 --> 13:51.540
for this National Lampoon
magazine

13:51.707 --> 13:53.209
that was being
started in New York.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.711
I thought, well, maybe I can
come down to New York

13:55.878 --> 13:57.254
and become rich and famous

13:57.421 --> 14:00.132
and get tremendous amounts
of drugs and sex and things.

14:00.925 --> 14:02.426
None of which panned out.

14:11.060 --> 14:13.145
Sean Kelly actually fixed me up

14:13.270 --> 14:15.147
on a blind date
with Michel Choquette.

14:15.481 --> 14:18.818
And then Michel started
taking me to New York with him

14:18.984 --> 14:22.071
because I was, quote unquote,
"Helping him with his work."

14:23.447 --> 14:25.199
I got into comedy the same way

14:25.366 --> 14:27.701
that Catherine the Great
got into politics

14:28.202 --> 14:29.286
on my back.

14:39.547 --> 14:43.051
I was working in a saloon
on the West Side.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.219
One night,
somebody came over to me.

14:45.386 --> 14:47.721
"There's a fellow back there
stealing the ketchup."

14:47.888 --> 14:48.931
And I go after him, and I said,

14:49.098 --> 14:50.578
"Excuse me,
I know what you're doing."

14:50.641 --> 14:52.762
And then I realize I'm standing
here accusing somebody

14:52.851 --> 14:56.105
of stealing ketchup
from a red rubber bottle.

14:56.397 --> 14:57.899
So this is so sad.

14:58.399 --> 15:00.693
Very shortly thereafter,
Henry offered me a job,

15:00.859 --> 15:02.152
and I gleefully took it.

15:04.572 --> 15:06.574
Doug and Henry had this idea
about bringing in

15:06.740 --> 15:10.661
this very hippie-ish
art studio called Cloud.

15:17.293 --> 15:20.296
Cloud Studios was
an independent design firm.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.382
That's a generous term to use
for those guys.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.217
Bill Skurski: We were,
quote unquote, "hippie artists"

15:25.384 --> 15:26.719
because we weren't out
to be millionaires.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.679
We were out to do
the things we liked to do.

15:29.430 --> 15:30.550
You know, we were turned on,

15:30.598 --> 15:32.975
and I don't mean by drugs,
I mean by the ideas.

15:35.227 --> 15:38.480
Doug liked to hang with people
like Cloud Studio artists.

15:38.647 --> 15:40.524
He like the fact
that they were kind of freaky

15:40.691 --> 15:43.152
and wore costumes
and had beards.

15:43.569 --> 15:45.362
Michael Sullivan: Doug would
come to parties that we had,

15:45.529 --> 15:48.616
and when Doug wasn't in
the office working,

15:48.782 --> 15:50.743
he was probably high as a kite.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.370
Kelly: Doug wanted to be
a beat or a hippie.

15:53.537 --> 15:56.081
Doug wanted to be trendy
and with it.

15:56.457 --> 16:00.169
I remember Doug asking, "Should I...
Should I be for the Black Panthers?"

16:00.753 --> 16:01.879
And he wasn't kidding.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.929
I saw the first issue, um,
which was terrible.

16:14.183 --> 16:15.393
Sam Gross: They had this duck.

16:15.559 --> 16:19.688
And they were gonna keep
the duck as a logo on the cover

16:19.855 --> 16:21.815
like the Playboy bunny.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.818
I said to Henry,
"Get rid of the duck."

16:24.985 --> 16:26.820
That's not the Playboy bunny
where, you know,

16:26.987 --> 16:30.783
you can put it on a garter,
make it a pasty or whatever.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.203
Everything they did was,
it had to be funny-looking,

16:34.370 --> 16:37.247
which means it was all sort of
squirrely and hippie-like.

16:40.751 --> 16:44.338
The issues were messy,
they were confusing.

16:44.505 --> 16:46.173
It wasn't bringing in
the readers,

16:46.340 --> 16:48.381
and they weren't getting
the sales on the newsstand.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.345
I told them, "We've gotta
replace your art director."

16:53.681 --> 16:56.183
Doug was very upset,
he wanted to keep Cloud,

16:56.350 --> 17:00.229
and he argued with me,
but it was my call, I was the boss.

17:01.146 --> 17:04.483
After we did the first seven issues,
I got a call from Doug Kenney.

17:04.650 --> 17:07.569
He said, "I'm sorry, but you're
no longer the art director."

17:07.736 --> 17:10.196
Great, knock yourself out.

17:22.584 --> 17:25.253
When I brought Michael Gross in,
Doug was kinda hostile.

17:25.421 --> 17:27.673
My first issue when
I walked in the door

17:27.839 --> 17:32.886
was the nostalgia issue,
which was Doug Kenney's baby.

17:41.729 --> 17:44.941
I knew when I was hired,
I was hired against Doug's will.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.276
In the sales pitch that I made,

17:47.443 --> 17:51.781
I referred to an article they'd
done about postage stamps.

17:51.947 --> 17:57.161
I said, "For these stamps to work,
they should look like real stamps."

18:00.372 --> 18:02.666
You should be fooled
when you look at them.

18:02.833 --> 18:06.336
Therefore the parody
is empowered.

18:06.503 --> 18:10.924
And in that little example,
he transformed the magazine.

18:13.594 --> 18:16.305
After that, Doug came
into my office and said,

18:16.472 --> 18:18.056
"You were right about this guy."

18:18.766 --> 18:21.810
As soon as Michael came aboard,
the Lampoon began to look great.

18:22.227 --> 18:25.063
[music] (King Floyd's
"Groove Me" plays) [music]

18:39.536 --> 18:41.955
Cerf: And what the Lampoon
began to be able to do

18:42.122 --> 18:45.042
was to create anything
in any format,

18:45.209 --> 18:47.419
so that it looked like the original.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.558
Michael O'Donoghue: You know,
Ed Sullivan, we kid him a lot,

19:01.725 --> 19:04.144
but Ed Sullivan is one of
the greats of this business,

19:04.311 --> 19:06.230
and I had a funny thought.

19:06.605 --> 19:12.027
What if Ed Sullivan were tortured,
and when I say tortured,

19:12.194 --> 19:14.947
what I mean is,
what if steel needles,

19:15.113 --> 19:18.450
say six inches long,
were plunged into Ed's eyes?

19:18.617 --> 19:21.245
I... I think it would go
something like this...

19:21.411 --> 19:25.833
(continuous screaming)

19:31.338 --> 19:34.132
You could walk into
the Lampoon editorial office

19:34.299 --> 19:35.884
and get high just walking in.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.720
But as long as it stayed
in the editorial office,

19:38.887 --> 19:41.098
and as long as they were doing
the terrific work

19:41.265 --> 19:43.976
they were doing,
I didn't tell them what to do.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.355
In the course of a given day,
it was understood

19:48.522 --> 19:52.609
that the day didn't end
when the office day ended.

19:52.776 --> 19:55.153
Beatts: They would have these
dinner meetings in, like,

19:55.320 --> 19:57.155
some of the worst restaurants
in New York.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.643
Brian McConnachie: There was
a saloon called The Green Man.

19:59.700 --> 20:04.037
It was hot,
it smelled of cat stink.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.249
And they would sit around a table
and drink tons and tons of beer.

20:07.416 --> 20:09.418
This would be paid for
by Henry or Doug.

20:09.585 --> 20:11.837
They would whip out their
company American Express card

20:12.004 --> 20:13.255
and pay for dinner.

20:13.422 --> 20:15.424
That's when we made up
the next issue.

20:15.591 --> 20:19.928
You had to either get Doug or Henry
to react positively to your idea.

20:20.512 --> 20:22.139
Ed Subhzky: The ideas would
come out very rapid fire.

20:22.306 --> 20:23.390
"How did he think of that?"
And then...

20:23.557 --> 20:24.808
"How did he think of that?"

20:25.017 --> 20:26.393
"How did he think of that?"

20:29.104 --> 20:30.981
We all do it the same way,
you get drunk,

20:31.398 --> 20:33.650
you go home,
you get up in the morning,

20:33.817 --> 20:35.027
and you write the piece.

20:35.319 --> 20:37.738
Gross: Doug was who
you went to really see

20:37.905 --> 20:41.199
if you had some wild and wacky
brilliant but funny idea.

20:41.742 --> 20:44.161
Doug would go,
"I gotcha, you're in."

20:44.328 --> 20:45.688
Beard: I mean,
he was a workaholic.

20:45.746 --> 20:47.748
I mean,
he was unbelievably productive.

20:47.915 --> 20:50.584
Like, he wrote
the Letters column every month.

20:50.751 --> 20:53.170
I mean, that's like 2200
very funny words of letters

20:53.337 --> 20:54.838
in, like, an hour and a half.

20:55.005 --> 20:57.216
I mean, every single time
there was something

20:57.382 --> 21:00.177
that had to be done,
he really was focused on it.

21:00.761 --> 21:02.429
Shary Flenniken:
Doug was valuable in that sense.

21:02.596 --> 21:05.265
Because he would
stimulate your ideas.

21:05.432 --> 21:08.226
So I don't think that there
really was anyone else

21:08.352 --> 21:10.771
who could inspire
other people like Doug.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.065
People would come
to Henry with ideas,

21:13.231 --> 21:14.691
and Henry would say,

21:15.192 --> 21:16.693
"Tempting, tempting."

21:16.860 --> 21:20.447
Whatever idea you pitched him,
he would say, "Tempting, tempting."

21:20.614 --> 21:22.658
"Tempting" meant that

21:22.783 --> 21:25.035
that is so awful,
it really blows chunks.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.747
Or, I'm about to have
an intellectual orgasm, it's so good.

21:29.498 --> 21:31.625
Subhzky: Somehow Henry Beard
would take this ragtag

21:31.792 --> 21:34.419
bunch of material and different
types of personalities

21:34.586 --> 21:36.338
and brilliantly
merge it together

21:36.505 --> 21:38.966
to make a magazine that was
surprisingly coherent.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.453
[music] (Dave Mason
"Only You Know & I Know" plays) [music]

21:53.063 --> 21:56.567
Beard: It was like we had
an attic full of culture

21:57.234 --> 22:01.780
that had been accumulating
from 1945 to 1970.

22:02.030 --> 22:05.659
And we opened the trap door,
and nobody had been up there,

22:06.410 --> 22:08.412
and we just basically looted it.

22:10.539 --> 22:12.791
Kelly: Michael O'Donoghue's
Vietnamese Baby Book

22:12.958 --> 22:15.669
was an extraordinary
piece of satire.

22:15.836 --> 22:19.548
It was a baby book, but it was
designed to be for a Vietnamese baby,

22:19.715 --> 22:22.759
and so it had things in it like
"Baby's First Wound."

22:24.511 --> 22:26.054
(laughing)

22:29.099 --> 22:31.351
Simmons:
It was incredibly dark,

22:31.601 --> 22:35.063
extremely political,
and it was funny.

22:36.982 --> 22:39.192
Michel Choquette came to me
with an idea.

22:39.359 --> 22:42.654
He had run into a guy who looked
just like Adolf Hitler.

22:43.196 --> 22:46.366
Flenniken: The piece was called
Stranger in Paradise

22:46.700 --> 22:50.912
which was about Adolf Hitler
really survived World War Two

22:51.121 --> 22:55.167
and was living on a tropical island
somewhere in the Caribbean.

22:56.585 --> 22:59.004
Simmons: I gave him a budget,
and ten days later

22:59.129 --> 23:00.631
I got a telegram, it said,

23:00.839 --> 23:04.009
"Hitler eating too much,
need more money."

23:04.176 --> 23:08.097
I said, "Stop feeding Hitler
and return to New York immediately."

23:08.263 --> 23:09.681
And it was a brilliant article,

23:09.848 --> 23:13.018
which we resold to almost
every foreign country.

23:16.021 --> 23:18.815
Doug Kenney came up with
the photo funnies concept.

23:18.982 --> 23:23.737
Doug insisted that they be us
and some girls we brought in.

23:23.904 --> 23:26.740
I was so opposed.
"Guys, we're a real magazine.

23:26.907 --> 23:29.493
We don't need to take Polaroid's
in a fuckin' office."

23:30.243 --> 23:33.496
I was so wrong,
because what Doug recognized

23:33.663 --> 23:37.084
is the audience identified with us.

23:37.876 --> 23:40.462
They went, "These are, like,
a bunch of jerk-offs like me."

23:40.629 --> 23:42.714
Like, "You and me,
Bernie, look!"

23:43.548 --> 23:46.009
That's Doug Kenney's genius.

23:47.135 --> 23:50.388
They did probably one of the greatest
magazine covers ever done.

23:50.555 --> 23:53.308
Beard: Ed Bluestone came
to the office, and he said,

23:53.475 --> 23:54.976
"You're gonna get a dog,"

23:55.143 --> 23:56.686
"gonna put a pistol to its head,
and you're gonna say"

23:56.853 --> 23:59.014
" 'If you don't buy this magazine,
we'll kill this dog...'"

23:59.106 --> 24:01.547
I said, "Ed, that's the most
brilliant thing I've ever heard."

24:01.900 --> 24:04.194
Gross:
It was a huge, huge hit

24:04.361 --> 24:08.698
because it's what every magazine
publisher wanted to do.

24:08.865 --> 24:11.284
All they want to say is,
"Buy the fucking magazine!"

24:19.251 --> 24:22.045
We realized that artists,
well-known established artists,

24:22.212 --> 24:25.590
people like Arnold Roth,
the great cartoonist Gahan Wilson,

24:27.050 --> 24:28.301
Sam Gross.

24:32.055 --> 24:34.182
Charlotte Rodriguez is
just a wonderful illustrator.

24:34.349 --> 24:35.642
Neal Adams.

24:35.809 --> 24:40.105
They all had to have
drawers full of wonderful stuff

24:40.272 --> 24:43.692
that had been rejected by
more traditional publications

24:43.859 --> 24:45.569
that weren't rejected because
they weren't funny or good,

24:45.735 --> 24:47.320
they were rejected because
they were a little too raunchy,

24:47.487 --> 24:49.322
so we knew we were that outlet.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.408
It didn't matter
how strange your work was.

24:51.575 --> 24:54.661
It didn't matter if your work
was anti-republican,

24:54.870 --> 24:56.746
anti-democrat,
anti-the-universe,

24:56.913 --> 24:58.874
whatever it was,
you could bring it into them,

24:59.040 --> 25:00.750
and they would not touch it.

25:01.168 --> 25:02.627
And that's one great thing
about the Lampoon.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.629
Never before and never
since had that kind of freedom.

25:04.796 --> 25:06.423
Gross:
If you were smart and funny,

25:06.590 --> 25:10.218
you walked into Henry Beard's office
or Doug Kenney's office,

25:10.385 --> 25:12.345
"Hello, can I come
show you some stuff?"

25:12.470 --> 25:15.031
He goes like this, he goes,
"Brilliant, thank you, you're hired."

25:15.056 --> 25:17.726
"We don't pay much,
but we're not gonna edit you."

25:17.893 --> 25:19.269
"We're not going to change you."

25:19.436 --> 25:21.855
"We're gonna let you be
what you want to be."

25:28.236 --> 25:29.571
We had one problem.

25:30.197 --> 25:31.656
It was losing a lot of money.

25:33.158 --> 25:34.659
Because we couldn't get advertising.

25:37.412 --> 25:39.492
Jerry Taylor: They sold little,
teeny mail order ads.

25:43.793 --> 25:48.715
They needed a pro to come in,
make it bigger, more legitimate.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.886
Danny Abelson: Jerry Taylor was
an extraordinarily successful

25:53.053 --> 25:54.930
and, sort of,
charismatic ad guy.

25:55.347 --> 25:57.547
Bill Lippe: We had a difficult
time getting appointments

25:57.599 --> 25:59.351
with advertising prospects.

25:59.643 --> 26:02.437
Taylor: It was always hard
to be taken seriously,

26:03.104 --> 26:04.981
so I had a dress code.

26:05.565 --> 26:08.485
Three piece suit,
white shirt, vest, tie.

26:08.652 --> 26:11.112
We walked in looking exactly
like the guys from Time Inc.

26:12.113 --> 26:15.825
But still nothing,
zero, nothing mattered.

26:16.409 --> 26:21.331
It was almost like they would
vomit up this hostility on the desk.

26:22.082 --> 26:24.292
And I would say,
"Okay, that's cool."

26:24.459 --> 26:25.900
"You don't have to buy
a subscription,"

26:25.919 --> 26:28.672
"but now let me tell you
why I think our audience"

26:28.838 --> 26:31.549
"is a great target for
your product."

26:32.050 --> 26:36.388
Our readership drank more than
the average adult.

26:36.554 --> 26:39.140
And the first liquor
advertisement that we had

26:39.307 --> 26:40.725
at the magazine was Jose Cuervo,

26:40.892 --> 26:42.727
and it made other people,
"Oh, wow,

26:42.894 --> 26:44.896
they got a liquor advertisement
in the Lampoon."

26:45.063 --> 26:46.731
And then the snowball started.

26:46.982 --> 26:49.276
[music] (King Floyd's
"Groove Me" plays) [music]

27:01.454 --> 27:03.373
Taylor: I had a slogan,
"National Lampoon.

27:03.748 --> 27:06.334
There's nothing funny about
the way it sells."

27:16.011 --> 27:19.014
Tell me about National Lampoon.
Why do you think it's so popular?

27:19.180 --> 27:21.016
Well, I think they're very witty.

27:21.182 --> 27:24.019
Yes, they're very witty,
but they are designed

27:24.185 --> 27:26.479
to please and flatter

27:26.646 --> 27:31.067
a particular audience of
fairly well-to-do nobodies

27:31.276 --> 27:33.153
who can afford to be nobodies.

27:33.320 --> 27:38.491
[music] (Pacific Gas & Electric
"Are You Ready?" plays) [music]

27:49.377 --> 27:52.130
I honestly think that
the National Lampoon

27:52.297 --> 27:54.674
is the most entertaining
magazine I have ever read.

27:54.758 --> 27:56.760
It's often the only
magazine that a lot of

27:56.926 --> 28:00.221
younger, hip people
today, uh, read.

28:00.388 --> 28:04.059
And why that is,
is I think they trust us.

28:04.225 --> 28:06.436
[music] (music continues) [music]

28:06.603 --> 28:08.323
It looks really good,
it's funny to look at.

28:08.396 --> 28:11.107
It's weird to look at.
And if you read the printed stuff,

28:11.274 --> 28:12.776
if you look at things
that aren't the pictures,

28:12.942 --> 28:14.652
occasionally you find
something really good

28:14.819 --> 28:17.220
which you don't find anywhere
else in the written humor form.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.366
There was a lot
of bad stuff going on.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.327
Christopher Buckley: We'd just
come out of the sixties.

28:22.494 --> 28:25.497
We had the assassinations,
Vietnam, now we had Watergate.

28:25.663 --> 28:32.378
So it was a perfect storm moment
of brilliant comic sensibilities

28:32.670 --> 28:35.673
hitting the culture
in a crisis point.

28:37.258 --> 28:39.886
Thornton: It was actually
the first time that I realized

28:40.053 --> 28:42.680
that, through humor,
you can tell the truth.

28:48.853 --> 28:50.522
Apatow:
In a mass media way,

28:50.688 --> 28:52.690
this kind of comedy didn't
exist before then.

28:52.857 --> 28:54.359
People weren't that frank

28:54.526 --> 28:58.071
and didn't attack the
establishment comedically.

28:58.238 --> 28:59.573
Beard: We're basically
a humor magazine,

28:59.739 --> 29:01.282
and we publish things
we consider to be funny.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.493
It's just impossible to put out
this kind of a publication

29:03.660 --> 29:08.289
and be, uh, completely unwilling
to do something offensive.

29:08.456 --> 29:09.916
I think it's sometimes conscious

29:10.083 --> 29:12.544
and sometimes just instinctive
that we push things

29:12.710 --> 29:14.629
as far as they possibly
can be pushed.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.036
I've always had a bad attitude.

29:16.089 --> 29:17.090
Interviewer: Always?

29:17.257 --> 29:19.426
I'm earning a living off
a bad attitude right now.

29:19.592 --> 29:20.927
Teachers always said
it would get me in trouble,

29:21.052 --> 29:22.453
but it's great,
it's working for me.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.560
In those days,
magazines were a bigger deal.

29:29.978 --> 29:34.441
People very much defined themselves
by the magazines they read.

29:38.111 --> 29:39.487
Simmons:
It was the most popular magazine

29:39.654 --> 29:41.406
on college campuses in America

29:41.573 --> 29:44.075
and was the second
most popular magazine

29:44.242 --> 29:47.871
on newsstands in America,
second only to Cosmopolitan.

29:50.623 --> 29:53.209
The biggest circulation
we ever had was a million.

29:53.376 --> 29:57.172
We had a pass along
of maybe 12 or 15.

29:57.589 --> 30:01.927
So we probably had
12 million readers.

30:02.093 --> 30:03.803
I mean, it was huge.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.930
It's our unerring charm
that makes our readers

30:06.097 --> 30:07.557
swallow it month after month.

30:07.724 --> 30:09.893
And frankly, that's what
it's all about, isn't it?

30:10.977 --> 30:13.730
Suddenly Doug Kenney disappeared.

30:16.441 --> 30:19.611
When Doug left or disappeared,

30:20.236 --> 30:22.697
it was...
It was a crisis.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.866
One Sunday morning
I came downstairs,

30:25.033 --> 30:26.743
and there was a note
in the kitchen, and it said,

30:26.910 --> 30:28.786
"Henry, I'm gonzo.

30:28.953 --> 30:30.997
I'm out of here, I'm gone,
I'm finished, I'm done."

30:31.623 --> 30:32.624
And he was gone.

30:40.173 --> 30:43.593
Radio Announcer: And now the
final question, for $25,000.

30:43.718 --> 30:45.762
Name four famous Mickeys.

30:47.305 --> 30:49.891
Man: Uh, Mickey Mouse.

30:50.391 --> 30:51.752
Radio Announcer:
That's number one.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.144
Man: Mickey, Mickey Mantle.

30:53.603 --> 30:54.854
Radio Announcer: Number two.

30:55.772 --> 30:58.691
Man: Uh, Mickey Rooney.

30:58.775 --> 30:59.901
Radio Announcer:
That's number three.

31:00.026 --> 31:02.362
Only one more,
and you win $25,000.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.198
Man: Mickey Way.

31:06.741 --> 31:07.909
Radio Announcer: Mickey Way?

31:08.826 --> 31:10.328
Man: The candy bar,
they'll take that, won't they?

31:10.495 --> 31:12.664
- The judges will take that?
- (buzzer sounding)

31:13.414 --> 31:16.918
Because I had had a previous career
as half of a comedy team,

31:17.085 --> 31:20.547
I had experience in how to write
and put together an album.

31:20.713 --> 31:24.300
And I was paired with O'Donoghue,
who wanted to do this album,

31:24.467 --> 31:26.719
so that's how
Radio Dinner came to be.

31:27.512 --> 31:30.598
Kelly: But the album itself was
very much Michael O'Donoghue.

31:30.974 --> 31:33.602
So Michael would say, "TV dinner?
What about radio dinner?"

31:33.768 --> 31:36.312
And then he'd go, "Yes," and
he'd write down Radio Dinner.

31:36.479 --> 31:38.189
And a year later
when someone said,

31:38.356 --> 31:39.857
"Let's do an album," he'd go...

31:40.858 --> 31:42.235
"Let's call it Radio Dinner."

31:43.236 --> 31:45.739
Cerf: Still one of my favorites
was a parody song

31:45.905 --> 31:47.865
that Michael O'Donoghue
and I wrote

31:48.032 --> 31:49.909
and that Tony Hendra
ended up performing,

31:50.076 --> 31:51.536
brilliantly, I might add.

31:51.786 --> 31:53.413
[music] I resent performing
for you fuckers [music]

31:53.580 --> 31:54.873
[music] Tell me,
what do you know? [music]

31:55.039 --> 31:56.666
[music] A lot of faggot
middle class kids [music]

31:56.833 --> 31:58.418
[music] Wearing long hair
and trendy clothes [music]

31:58.585 --> 32:00.128
[music] I don't owe you fuckers
anything [music]

32:00.295 --> 32:02.714
[music] And all I've got
to say is fuck you... [music]

32:02.880 --> 32:04.281
Cerf:
It was right after John Lennon

32:04.382 --> 32:06.509
had an interview in Rolling Stone,

32:06.676 --> 32:10.555
and we had the idea that if you just
put in an occasional rhyme...

32:10.722 --> 32:13.642
[music] The sky is blue... [music]

32:13.975 --> 32:16.269
You could set the whole
interview to music.

32:16.436 --> 32:18.062
[music] George said
she gave off evil vibes [music]

32:18.229 --> 32:20.314
[music] I should have beat the fucking
shit right out of him [music]

32:20.481 --> 32:24.527
[music] Him with his
fucking Hare Krishna [music]

32:26.863 --> 32:28.703
Hendra: The album was actually
a great success.

32:28.865 --> 32:30.346
It got a tremendous amount
of airplay.

32:30.491 --> 32:31.993
It was also
nominated for a Grammy,

32:32.160 --> 32:33.640
which was pretty good,
first time out.

32:33.745 --> 32:37.123
It showed that we could more
than simply put out a magazine.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.878
The truth is,
Doug carried the magazine.

32:42.045 --> 32:45.590
If I wrote a hundred words,
he wrote a thousand, every month.

32:45.757 --> 32:48.259
People hadn't really expected
that he would disappear,

32:48.426 --> 32:50.720
but Doug was
not a stable person.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.263
Beard:
He had an older brother

32:52.388 --> 32:54.109
who was the preferred son,
the favorite son,

32:54.515 --> 32:56.976
and his older brother
died at an early age,

32:57.143 --> 32:58.853
and it was a great loss
to his parents,

32:59.020 --> 33:01.481
and his parents, kind of,
treated Doug as the...

33:01.648 --> 33:03.984
As the "Well, I guess
that's all we've got left."

33:04.359 --> 33:07.153
It probably did have
some emotional impact on him.

33:07.445 --> 33:10.006
Gross: And basically what happened
is he had a nervous breakdown.

33:10.073 --> 33:12.283
And he just couldn't
take it anymore.

33:12.575 --> 33:13.951
John Weidman:
He needed a break.

33:14.118 --> 33:16.913
He was having sort of
a mid-life crisis

33:17.080 --> 33:18.456
at the age of 24, whatever.

33:18.581 --> 33:20.083
He was trying
to figure himself out,

33:20.291 --> 33:23.002
and he picked up and moved
to Martha's Vineyard.

33:24.087 --> 33:26.423
I think he wanted to try
something else before 30.

33:26.631 --> 33:28.257
He's got to do something new.

33:28.424 --> 33:31.260
Hendra: He wanted to write
Teenage Commies from Outer Space.

33:31.427 --> 33:34.263
I went up to Martha's Vineyard
to actually see Doug.

33:34.430 --> 33:38.893
My idea was to take stuff
and develop from the magazine

33:39.060 --> 33:41.479
and then put it on stage,
and then Matty said

33:41.646 --> 33:42.814
it needed Doug's touch.

33:42.980 --> 33:44.148
He looked completely wasted.

33:44.315 --> 33:47.235
He'd obviously been
dropping acid and eating very little.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.510
He wanted to go for a walk
'cause he had something to show me.

33:50.571 --> 33:52.824
And we walked out to where
there's this peculiar,

33:52.990 --> 33:55.284
kind of, mud which runs
right down to the sea.

33:55.451 --> 33:58.204
And he said
it was really groovy,

33:58.371 --> 34:01.999
really groovy in the summer
to slather yourself with this stuff

34:02.125 --> 34:03.209
and just lie in the sun.

34:04.836 --> 34:06.546
So I had pitched my idea,

34:06.713 --> 34:08.797
and he said,
"No, man, I can't do that.

34:08.965 --> 34:10.425
I'm too deep into my novel."

34:10.591 --> 34:13.344
And it turned he'd written
one and a half chapters.

34:17.181 --> 34:19.641
[music] Aah... [music]

34:23.396 --> 34:26.774
The first album did so well,
we've got to do another album.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.485
Wouldn't it be fun
to parody Woodstock?

34:29.652 --> 34:32.321
We were going to do
a three night show, record it,

34:32.487 --> 34:35.074
edit it, and that would be
the second album.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.161
But it got out of hand.

34:38.327 --> 34:39.688
[music] (rock music plays) [music]

34:39.829 --> 34:42.706
[music] We are Lemmings! [music]

34:42.873 --> 34:46.460
[music] (guitar riff plays) [music]

34:46.627 --> 34:49.505
We needed a cast of
people who could be very funny

34:49.672 --> 34:51.841
and could play an instrument

34:52.007 --> 34:54.761
or, at the very least,
sing extremely well.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.469
Simmons: Tony Hendra called me
one night, and he said,

34:56.637 --> 34:59.140
"There's a guy here
at Second City in Chicago,"

34:59.307 --> 35:02.685
"and he's the funniest actor
I've ever seen in my life."

35:02.852 --> 35:03.895
"He's incredible."

35:04.061 --> 35:05.479
So I said,
"Bring him to New York."

35:08.065 --> 35:09.567
John Belushi: Can I have
your attention please?

35:09.734 --> 35:12.695
The theme of Lemmings
Woodshuck Festival

35:12.862 --> 35:15.948
was that everyone's
come together to off themself.

35:16.115 --> 35:19.619
Lemmings are animals that commit
suicide by going over cliffs.

35:20.870 --> 35:23.706
So they were giving advice on how
they might do this along the way

35:23.873 --> 35:25.625
by the announcer, who was John.

35:25.792 --> 35:28.294
(applause)

35:28.461 --> 35:30.797
Now we all know
why we came here.

35:31.756 --> 35:33.299
A million of us,

35:33.925 --> 35:35.885
we came here to off ourselves.

35:36.052 --> 35:38.763
He made the character into this,
kind of,

35:38.930 --> 35:43.184
manically agreeable
murderous lunatic.

35:43.351 --> 35:45.144
If your buddy is too stoned
to off himself,

35:45.311 --> 35:46.687
do him a favor.

35:46.854 --> 35:48.815
Roll him up in his sleeping bag

35:48.981 --> 35:51.818
and drag him over to where
the tractors can run him down.

35:54.237 --> 35:58.157
Chris Guest did a James Taylor
that was genius.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.243
[music] Farewell,
New York City [music]

36:00.409 --> 36:03.787
[music] With your streets that
flash like strobes [music]

36:04.247 --> 36:06.499
[music] Farewell, Carolina [music]

36:06.749 --> 36:09.794
[music] Where I left
my frontal lobes [music]

36:09.961 --> 36:11.420
Hey! Chevy!

36:11.587 --> 36:13.005
Hey! What's your
name again?!

36:13.256 --> 36:15.633
- John.
- John, hey!

36:15.800 --> 36:17.719
Chevy Chase: There was a sketch
where John and I

36:17.885 --> 36:19.929
were two high school
or college guys

36:20.096 --> 36:21.848
at urinals, just talking.

36:21.973 --> 36:23.308
I can't even remember
what it was about,

36:23.474 --> 36:25.977
but I do remember that
they were laughing all through.

36:26.435 --> 36:28.354
And it became clearer
and clearer to me

36:28.479 --> 36:29.522
that they were laughing at John,

36:29.689 --> 36:30.857
whether he was saying
anything or not.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.024
(laughter)

36:32.108 --> 36:33.776
I'm like this, talking to John.

36:35.069 --> 36:38.614
And finally after, like, a week,
I have to look over at him

36:38.781 --> 36:40.449
to see what the hell
is going on,

36:40.616 --> 36:42.536
why are they always laughing?
And he's like this.

36:44.078 --> 36:47.039
(chuckling)

36:47.456 --> 36:49.083
Never knew it, never told me.

36:50.042 --> 36:52.253
The little bastard just took me.

36:52.420 --> 36:55.131
(laughing)

36:55.590 --> 36:56.799
It was so good.

36:57.967 --> 37:00.344
It was decided, because
the ticket sales were so brisk,

37:00.845 --> 37:02.445
that we would simply
leave the show open.

37:02.555 --> 37:04.765
And at that point,
from a record project,

37:04.932 --> 37:07.101
it actually become an
off-Broadway show.

37:07.685 --> 37:09.103
[music] (piano music plays) [music]

37:09.270 --> 37:12.064
It was in this little
tiny club in the Village,

37:12.231 --> 37:15.443
but it was an underground hit,
it was a cool thing to go see.

37:15.610 --> 37:16.903
(indistinct singing)
[music] Well I'm standing here [music]

37:17.069 --> 37:18.404
[music] Singing my song [music]

37:18.571 --> 37:22.283
[music] Well, there ain't nothing
to do, all my friends are gone [music]

37:22.783 --> 37:25.786
[music] I had sunshine
and a country home [music]

37:25.953 --> 37:28.873
[music] I've been on the cover
of Rolling Stone [music]

37:29.040 --> 37:31.042
- [music] But it lonely [music]
- [music] Yes it's lonely [music]

37:31.208 --> 37:32.877
Kelly:
When we were with the actors,

37:33.044 --> 37:34.754
it got more rambunctious.

37:34.921 --> 37:37.965
Because that was
when actual uppers and downers

37:38.132 --> 37:41.093
and nose candy,
and things, entered.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.387
What about the acid?
You gonna open the acid?

37:45.264 --> 37:46.349
What acid?

37:47.600 --> 37:49.602
What do you mean,
"What acid," John?

37:49.769 --> 37:51.520
- What acid?
- The LSD 25, man.

37:51.687 --> 37:53.230
You mean the LSD zero?

37:53.397 --> 37:54.941
(audience laughing)

37:55.107 --> 37:56.567
Tony would go to Matty and say

37:56.734 --> 38:00.446
he needed X bucks
to buy marijuana for the cast.

38:00.613 --> 38:03.407
And then Tony, of course, would
immediately buy cocaine with it.

38:03.908 --> 38:06.244
I mean, everybody can buy
their own marijuana.

38:07.078 --> 38:09.246
[music] (music continues) [music]

38:09.413 --> 38:10.581
(applause)

38:10.748 --> 38:12.833
Hey! Hey,
You gotta get up!

38:14.543 --> 38:16.462
Hup! Hup!

38:16.629 --> 38:19.423
(groaning)

38:23.135 --> 38:24.178
Whoa!

38:24.345 --> 38:25.930
(laughter)

38:29.016 --> 38:31.185
[music] What would you do [music]

38:31.852 --> 38:34.396
[music] If I sang out of tune? [music]

38:34.563 --> 38:37.817
- One, two, three!
- [music] Lonely at the bottom [music]

38:37.984 --> 38:40.278
[music] Lonely,
lonely, lonely [music]

38:40.444 --> 38:42.905
- [music] Lonely at the bottom [music]
- [music] I said my baby's lonely [music]

38:43.072 --> 38:44.699
[music] I said she lonely,
I said she lonely [music]

38:44.865 --> 38:47.451
[music] I said she lonely,
I said she lonely, I said... [music]

38:48.452 --> 38:50.121
(music stops)

38:50.287 --> 38:54.333
(cheering and applause)

38:54.667 --> 38:58.129
Gross: Henry Beard's
office door hardly ever opened.

38:58.462 --> 39:01.215
Henry Beard sat there and typed.

39:01.382 --> 39:02.758
(typewriter keys clicking)

39:02.925 --> 39:05.553
Pull it out, pull it out.
Pages, pages, pages.

39:05.761 --> 39:10.808
Genius, brilliant,
intellectual and otherwise pages.

39:10.975 --> 39:12.018
That's it.

39:13.102 --> 39:15.183
Beard: Suddenly I was working
a hundred hours a week.

39:15.312 --> 39:17.523
You know, I would
go home and go to bed

39:17.773 --> 39:19.150
and then wake up
the next morning

39:19.316 --> 39:21.819
and go to the office
and start writing again.

39:23.070 --> 39:24.447
Hendra: Henry, really,

39:24.613 --> 39:26.157
had become
the leader of the magazine.

39:26.323 --> 39:28.204
When Doug was still there,
it was a partnership,

39:28.367 --> 39:31.245
and when he left,
Henry was the only person

39:31.370 --> 39:33.914
who could actually, sort of,
be the final authority,

39:34.081 --> 39:36.709
and he had done that very,
I think, grudgingly.

39:37.251 --> 39:40.212
So when Doug sidled back
into the office,

39:40.379 --> 39:44.467
sort of saying, "Hi, I'm back,"
no one had much patience for Doug.

39:45.092 --> 39:48.220
He came back humbled,
deeply humbled.

39:48.387 --> 39:50.097
Deeply, sadly humbled.

39:50.264 --> 39:52.975
Tail between his legs.
He knew what he had done.

39:55.144 --> 39:57.271
Gross:
Doug brought the novel back,

39:57.438 --> 40:00.149
and Henry looks at it and goes,
"Jesus, this is awful."

40:00.316 --> 40:02.401
He... I... I read this thing,
it just made no sense.

40:02.568 --> 40:04.278
It was a complete nothing.

40:04.862 --> 40:06.989
And what he did was,
he opened up the window

40:07.156 --> 40:10.159
on Madison Avenue and just
scaled the whole thing out.

40:12.286 --> 40:14.006
Gross: There were people
not talking to him.

40:14.205 --> 40:16.886
And people were, like, doing this.
They didn't even want to see him.

40:17.625 --> 40:19.502
I was pissed at Doug,
and I said,

40:19.668 --> 40:21.921
"Doug, you know,
you fucking let me down.

40:23.172 --> 40:24.173
You let us all down."

40:33.724 --> 40:35.935
- Julius: This is Julius...
- Ethel: And Ethel...

40:36.102 --> 40:37.144
Both:
Rosenberg.

40:37.311 --> 40:40.356
Julius: Did you know that
the majority of dead people are Jews?

40:40.523 --> 40:45.152
Mm-hmm. 85% of all
dead people are Jewish.

40:45.444 --> 40:46.737
So remember,

40:46.904 --> 40:49.782
if you persecute Jews
when you're alive,

40:49.949 --> 40:53.244
boy, are you going to get it
when you're dead.

40:54.453 --> 40:57.331
Doug had just gotten back from
being AWOL for about a year,

40:57.498 --> 40:58.791
and I had just been hired.

40:58.958 --> 41:01.836
And Michael O'Donoghue,
in the early Lampoon,

41:02.002 --> 41:05.422
wrote a brief parody
of a high school year book.

41:05.589 --> 41:07.716
Matty Simmons had the idea
of turning this

41:07.883 --> 41:11.095
into a special edition
of doing a yearbook.

41:11.262 --> 41:14.431
Matty gave us the job because,
basically, we couldn't say no.

41:14.598 --> 41:17.977
Doug was still in the doghouse,
and I was a fresh hire.

41:18.144 --> 41:19.520
Simmons:
They weren't hot about the idea.

41:19.687 --> 41:22.565
But I wanted to do it,
and I pushed them.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.733
O'Rourke: We're sitting around,
bemoaning our fate.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.735
"This is such a stupid idea.

41:26.902 --> 41:28.571
How are we gonna
talk him out of this?"

41:29.155 --> 41:30.955
And we just started talking
about high school.

41:31.073 --> 41:33.284
And we started
talking about how, really,

41:33.450 --> 41:35.244
there are only a dozen people
in high school.

41:35.411 --> 41:36.971
Well, there's
the beautiful frigid girl,

41:36.996 --> 41:38.205
there's the stupid jock,

41:38.414 --> 41:40.416
there's the exchange student
from "Absurd-istan."

41:40.583 --> 41:43.085
You know, there's only a dozen,
18 people in high school.

41:44.211 --> 41:45.254
[music] (Chuck Berry "School
Days" plays) [music]

41:45.421 --> 41:46.422
Bingo.

41:48.424 --> 41:49.704
O'Rourke: This is how you do it.

41:49.717 --> 41:52.178
You cast these 18 characters,

41:52.344 --> 41:54.471
and you spin out a year
of their life,

41:54.638 --> 41:56.348
and you can get
a whole book out of this.

41:59.310 --> 42:00.895
Hirsch:
When I got to the Lampoon,

42:01.061 --> 42:03.564
Anne Beatts and Emily Prager
were the only two women writers.

42:03.731 --> 42:05.441
So I was desperate
to work on anything.

42:05.608 --> 42:08.194
And so I said to Doug Kenney,
"I volunteer.

42:08.360 --> 42:12.698
I will do anything
you want to help you."

42:13.073 --> 42:15.158
I walked with crutches,
I had polio as a kid.

42:15.326 --> 42:17.161
He said, "Oh, well, you know,
there's always a handicapped kid"

42:17.286 --> 42:18.287
"in every school."

42:18.454 --> 42:20.039
"Can we borrow
your crutches?"

42:20.664 --> 42:22.541
And I went,
"Well, not without me, you can't!"

42:22.708 --> 42:24.543
And so he said "All right,
well, will you be in it?"

42:24.710 --> 42:26.462
And I was Ursula Wattersky.

42:31.008 --> 42:33.594
I think P.J. was
the women's gym teacher.

42:33.761 --> 42:35.888
Brian McConnachie doing
the optometrist club,

42:36.055 --> 42:38.224
and they're all,
sort of, listing to the side.

42:38.390 --> 42:39.725
It was a wonderful experience.

42:39.892 --> 42:42.269
It was like producing
an independent movie.

42:43.771 --> 42:47.024
It was perfect for Doug
because he had simultaneously

42:47.191 --> 42:51.320
been just a regular high school guy
and Doug Kenney,

42:52.446 --> 42:54.406
super brain,
watching from on high.

42:55.199 --> 42:57.451
He wore his high school jacket
all the time, Doug.

42:57.618 --> 42:59.787
That was his natural costume.

42:59.954 --> 43:02.539
Doug used his own picture
as the dead student

43:02.665 --> 43:04.416
that the yearbook
was dedicated to.

43:05.084 --> 43:06.794
[music] (music continues) [music]

43:08.504 --> 43:11.382
It was a work of
true satirical brilliance.

43:11.548 --> 43:14.384
There were 50 storylines

43:14.551 --> 43:16.679
woven through it in all the different

43:16.845 --> 43:19.765
sections of it.
It was really a comic masterpiece.

43:21.141 --> 43:23.560
Gross: Doug was the personality
of National Lampoon.

43:23.727 --> 43:25.229
He understood...

43:26.981 --> 43:28.148
...people.

43:30.651 --> 43:32.152
(music stops)

43:33.988 --> 43:37.909
Simmons: Michael O'Donoghue
in the office was like a time bomb.

43:38.367 --> 43:40.160
You never knew
when it was going to go off.

43:40.327 --> 43:43.789
Michael O'Donoghue was... Seemed
to be the world's angriest guy.

43:43.956 --> 43:45.207
Simmons:
And he would scream and yell,

43:45.374 --> 43:47.293
and he would throw
telephone books.

43:47.459 --> 43:49.044
And the phone,
he'd rip the phone out

43:49.211 --> 43:51.630
and throw it across the office,
narrowly missing people.

43:52.006 --> 43:54.591
He was prone to,
when you're stuck,

43:54.758 --> 43:57.136
you turn around, you wanna
get angry at somebody.

43:57.303 --> 43:58.595
And you hit
the people closest to you.

43:58.762 --> 44:00.347
You start slapping them around.

44:00.973 --> 44:02.892
Hendra: Michael was like
a bundle of dynamite.

44:03.058 --> 44:05.811
For some reason, we hit it off
when I first came to the magazine.

44:06.228 --> 44:07.688
And we were friends for a while.

44:07.855 --> 44:10.107
As everybody was
with Michael, for a while.

44:12.067 --> 44:15.153
Beatts: Michael had gotten
into a giant feud with Tony

44:15.404 --> 44:18.949
over the fact that Tony had slept
with Michael's then-girlfriend, Amy.

44:19.116 --> 44:22.244
Michael marched into my office
and said, "You gotta fire him."

44:22.995 --> 44:25.914
And he told me what happened.
I said, "Michael, the one thing"

44:26.081 --> 44:28.792
"I never want to do is get
involved with the personal lives"

44:28.959 --> 44:30.461
"of the people who work here."

44:30.627 --> 44:34.381
Matty gave Michael
the National Lampoon Radio Hour

44:34.548 --> 44:36.467
as a compensatory thing.

44:36.633 --> 44:40.178
Like, okay, they have Lemmings,
you can have the Radio Hour.

44:40.596 --> 44:43.599
[music] (theme music plays) [music]

44:43.766 --> 44:45.851
- (knocking on door)
- Woman: Who is it?

44:46.018 --> 44:47.102
Man: Tom the Baker, here.

44:47.269 --> 44:49.313
Woman: Oh, Tom. Come on in.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.689
(door opens)

44:50.856 --> 44:52.316
You're not Tom the baker!

44:52.483 --> 44:53.692
Woman 2:
Watch out, he's got a knife.

44:53.859 --> 44:55.319
(woman 1 gasping)
Who are you?

44:55.486 --> 44:56.779
Man: I'm Bob the rapist.

44:56.945 --> 44:59.114
- Woman: Oh, Bob.
- Woman 2: Oh, Bob.

44:59.281 --> 45:00.949
Woman: Come on in,
have some coffee.

45:01.116 --> 45:02.368
Woman 2: Good to see you.

45:04.828 --> 45:07.039
In the beginning of the Radio Hour,
I guess it was envisioned

45:07.206 --> 45:08.832
that the editors
would be the writers.

45:08.999 --> 45:10.759
Michael had just sort of
written Lemmings off

45:10.876 --> 45:12.086
and everybody in it.

45:13.087 --> 45:15.087
One day, Chris Guest was
supposed to come in and do

45:15.130 --> 45:16.673
a Peter O'Toole imitation,

45:16.840 --> 45:18.509
and he called up
last minute to cancel.

45:19.009 --> 45:21.512
And I said,
"John can do Peter O'Toole."

45:21.678 --> 45:23.806
And that's how
everybody in Second City

45:23.972 --> 45:25.682
entered the Radio Hour.

45:25.849 --> 45:29.103
Gilda Radner: Hi, I'm your
host person, Gilda Radner,

45:29.269 --> 45:31.814
and I am going to read you
the people who contributed.

45:31.980 --> 45:34.316
John Belushi,
Brian Doyle-Murray,

45:34.483 --> 45:36.693
Bill Murray, Gilda Radner,
Harold "Rahmis",

45:36.860 --> 45:38.195
- Ed Subitzky.
- Harold Ramis: It's Ramis.

45:38.362 --> 45:40.280
- Gilda: What?
- Ramis: Ramis, not "Rahmis."

45:40.989 --> 45:42.908
Hirsch: These guys were
all Second City guys,

45:43.075 --> 45:47.371
and they learned a craft,
which is writing sketches.

45:47.538 --> 45:49.779
- What's the point, Coach?
- The point is this, Shnobble.

45:49.873 --> 45:51.291
There are winners and losers,

45:51.458 --> 45:53.339
but some guys don't even get
to finish the game.

45:53.419 --> 45:54.920
Yeah?
What are you talking about?

45:55.087 --> 45:57.214
There's a big coach
somewhere in the universe,

45:57.381 --> 45:58.757
and he's taking one of us up.

45:58.924 --> 46:02.469
- Stefanski, you got Leukoplakia.
- Huh?

46:02.636 --> 46:04.721
The doc says you might
not last the season.

46:04.888 --> 46:07.474
(all moaning)

46:07.641 --> 46:10.352
I suppose that one of us
ought to say something, Coach,

46:10.519 --> 46:11.770
and as the defensive captain...

46:12.020 --> 46:13.272
Harold: Wait, that's not all.

46:13.439 --> 46:15.691
Luciano has Huntington's Chorea.

46:16.024 --> 46:17.776
Shaffer and Collins,
you two have

46:17.943 --> 46:19.820
sickle cell anemia, highly advanced.

46:20.279 --> 46:23.449
Thomson, Carson and McNulty,
spinal meningitis.

46:23.615 --> 46:24.658
(all moaning)

46:24.867 --> 46:27.244
Okay, that's pretty good.
You can go on to the next one.

46:27.619 --> 46:30.539
Danny Abelson: For human nerds, the
National Lampoon is like an obscure

46:30.706 --> 46:33.834
record label that first recorded
Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton.

46:34.001 --> 46:37.087
You, sort of,
can trace extraordinary talent

46:37.254 --> 46:39.339
back to this one
little record label.

46:39.506 --> 46:42.342
But we do a fair amount
of music on the radio show.

46:42.509 --> 46:46.388
We do, um, often performed
by us because we're so awful,

46:46.555 --> 46:48.974
that we couldn't ever get
professionals to sound

46:49.141 --> 46:51.101
as bad as we wanted
the thing to sound.

46:51.351 --> 46:54.021
[music] I wish I was a Negro [music]

46:54.188 --> 46:56.607
[music] With lots of Negro soul [music]

46:57.191 --> 46:59.860
[music] So I could stay true
to my ethnic roots [music]

47:00.027 --> 47:02.446
[music] And still play
rock'n'roll [music]

47:02.613 --> 47:04.949
[music] If I was a funky Negro [music]

47:05.115 --> 47:08.076
[music] Eating soul
food barbecues [music]

47:08.577 --> 47:11.246
[music] I wouldn't have to sing
the middle-class liberal [music]

47:11.413 --> 47:12.998
[music] Well-intentioned blues [music]

47:13.165 --> 47:16.251
We get some reaction
from people accusing us

47:16.418 --> 47:18.045
of being racist or anti-Semitic,

47:18.212 --> 47:19.963
or we even got complaints
from the Nazis

47:20.130 --> 47:22.090
that we were
anti-Nazi or something.

47:23.509 --> 47:25.749
Kenney: All of the editors,
I think, to a certain degree,

47:25.886 --> 47:28.055
are unbelievable racists.

47:28.222 --> 47:30.474
You ask,
"Are we anti-Polack?"

47:30.641 --> 47:33.352
Of course, we're anti-Polack,
they're so dumb.

47:33.519 --> 47:35.359
Interviewer: What about racism
being dealt with

47:35.479 --> 47:36.813
in the way it is in Lampoon?

47:36.980 --> 47:38.815
Oh, I suggest simply
the hotter the issue,

47:38.982 --> 47:40.526
the more they cool it
by hilarity.

47:40.692 --> 47:43.904
Why does one laugh? Laughter is
entirely a defense mechanism.

47:44.071 --> 47:46.990
Laughter is a defense
against hostility,

47:47.157 --> 47:48.659
a replacement for hostility,

47:48.825 --> 47:52.204
a, uh, a defense mechanism
against guilt, embarrassment.

47:52.371 --> 47:55.290
Michael did a thing about
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

47:55.457 --> 47:57.376
except, of course,
the Colonel was serving

47:57.543 --> 47:58.835
Kentucky Fried black people.

47:58.919 --> 48:01.630
And you think, well,
that's beyond tasteless.

48:01.797 --> 48:03.840
Except it's, sort of, true.

48:04.341 --> 48:06.302
We're a good,
humorous say anything which is true,

48:06.385 --> 48:08.387
which you would do
anything to deny is true.

48:08.554 --> 48:10.222
Kelly:
So I wouldn't say the

48:10.472 --> 48:13.225
Kentucky Fried joke was
a racist joke.

48:13.392 --> 48:15.352
It was a joke against racism.

48:15.686 --> 48:19.189
Judith Belushi: We had a very
disgruntled sponsor who dropped us.

48:19.356 --> 48:21.556
And I remember the memo
we got after, it was from Matty.

48:21.608 --> 48:23.652
"You can make fun
of poor people,"

48:24.027 --> 48:25.237
"you can make fun of Indians,"

48:25.362 --> 48:27.823
"you can make fun
of anything you want,"

48:27.990 --> 48:29.866
"but do not make fun
of the Jews."

48:32.202 --> 48:34.371
It is the job of a satirist, okay,

48:34.538 --> 48:37.249
to make people in power
uncomfortable,

48:37.416 --> 48:38.959
really uncomfortable.

48:39.126 --> 48:41.837
To the point where they go,
"This has to be stopped."

48:42.087 --> 48:44.506
[music] Well-intentioned blues [music]

48:50.220 --> 48:53.265
In the National Lampoon,
what really gets people angry?

48:53.432 --> 48:55.767
What do they...
What do they sue you about?

48:55.934 --> 48:59.438
Probably the most famous suit
we ever had was the Volkswagen suit.

49:01.231 --> 49:03.191
We had a picture
of a Volkswagen.

49:03.358 --> 49:05.444
We said if Teddy Kennedy
had driven a Volkswagen,

49:05.611 --> 49:09.156
he'd be President today.
Which is true, of course.

49:09.323 --> 49:10.699
Teddy Kennedy would be President

49:10.782 --> 49:13.076
if he drove a car that floated.

49:13.994 --> 49:15.914
Well, the first thing we did,
and this was Matty,

49:15.954 --> 49:17.664
he sent out a news release,

49:17.831 --> 49:20.876
along with the ad, nationwide,

49:21.835 --> 49:23.879
saying that
Volkswagen was suing us.

49:24.046 --> 49:26.298
It got picked up in
every newspaper in America.

49:26.465 --> 49:29.718
They ran the ad,
and the issue sold out.

49:30.927 --> 49:34.055
I had let them get away
with things that even shocked me.

49:38.602 --> 49:41.355
One day, I got a call from
the Vice President at NBC.

49:41.521 --> 49:46.193
He said, "We have been talking about
doing a Saturday night satire show."

49:46.360 --> 49:47.444
"Would you be interested?"

49:47.611 --> 49:49.363
We had all sorts
of things going on.

49:49.529 --> 49:51.114
We had live shows on the road,

49:51.281 --> 49:54.660
we had the magazine,
we had a book division.

49:54.826 --> 49:56.286
It was the biggest radio show
in the country.

49:56.453 --> 49:57.913
It was on 600 stations.

49:58.080 --> 50:01.041
We were the humor empire
in the United States.

50:01.750 --> 50:05.003
I said, "I really appreciate it,
but it's too demanding."

50:05.837 --> 50:09.633
National Lampoon was
just a magazine, you know?

50:09.800 --> 50:13.512
But suddenly, it was records
and actors and musicians.

50:13.679 --> 50:15.319
Abelson: There was
an extraordinary change

50:15.389 --> 50:17.933
in the sense that the spotlight
was suddenly being shared.

50:18.100 --> 50:19.810
Well, I remember Chevy
coming to the office

50:19.976 --> 50:22.056
and John Belushi coming
to the office, and those guys

50:22.145 --> 50:23.730
had an energy to them
that was very exciting.

50:23.897 --> 50:25.857
And you felt that it must have
been difficult for editors

50:26.024 --> 50:28.585
who'd been around for a long time
to not be a part of that group.

50:32.656 --> 50:34.991
The more famous
and the more popular we got,

50:35.158 --> 50:38.370
the more people's egos
were doing this.

50:38.537 --> 50:40.038
Kelly: Michael and Tony were

50:40.205 --> 50:41.707
heading in their
different directions.

50:41.873 --> 50:44.584
It was very difficult,
especially because you couldn't

50:44.751 --> 50:46.670
work for both of them
at the same time,

50:46.837 --> 50:50.006
or they would consider you
a traitor and a Mordred.

50:50.173 --> 50:51.425
We don't need this,
and this is supposed to be

50:51.591 --> 50:52.801
fun and happy and what not.

50:52.968 --> 50:54.803
We're getting paid to be
as silly as we can.

50:54.970 --> 50:56.346
Simmons: We're talking about
the smartest,

50:56.513 --> 50:59.599
most curious,
free-spirited people.

50:59.850 --> 51:01.643
These were not cageable people.

51:01.810 --> 51:05.397
And people started
leaving the Lampoon.

51:08.567 --> 51:10.986
O'Donoghue,
his girlfriend was Anne Beatts.

51:11.153 --> 51:14.615
Beatts: Matty had given
Michael Simmons my desk,

51:14.781 --> 51:16.158
and I was furious.

51:16.324 --> 51:18.326
It had taken me all
that many years to get a desk,

51:18.493 --> 51:20.245
and then suddenly I didn't
have it anymore.

51:20.412 --> 51:22.414
He called me up
one morning, and he said,

51:22.581 --> 51:24.416
"I gotta talk to you,
Anne Beatts must have"

51:24.583 --> 51:25.783
"an office at the radio show."

51:25.876 --> 51:27.753
"If you don't do this
I'm gonna quit."

51:27.919 --> 51:30.922
Matty said, "Well,
if she doesn't like it, she can quit,"

51:31.089 --> 51:32.758
"and if you don't like it,
you can quit."

51:32.924 --> 51:34.634
And Michael said,
"I quit."

51:35.051 --> 51:36.303
And he quit.

51:37.471 --> 51:38.722
And that was it.

51:39.222 --> 51:41.183
Michael left, never came back.

51:43.810 --> 51:45.562
Gross: I had been with
the magazine four or five years.

51:45.729 --> 51:47.564
Rock'n'roll is the best analogy.

51:47.731 --> 51:50.400
You know, it's a band that
just started to go bad.

51:50.567 --> 51:51.928
So it was just time
for me to move.

52:00.535 --> 52:01.870
Bill Murray: Bless me Father,
for I have sinned.

52:01.995 --> 52:03.205
Brian Doyle-Murray: And
how long has it been

52:03.330 --> 52:04.331
since your last confession,
my son?

52:04.498 --> 52:05.708
Murray: About four months,
I guess, Father.

52:05.874 --> 52:06.994
Doyle-Murray:
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

52:07.042 --> 52:08.562
Murray: Uh...
And I fucked this girl...

52:08.710 --> 52:10.253
Uh...
Excuse my French, Father,

52:10.420 --> 52:11.755
Uh... I went all the way
with this girl.

52:11.922 --> 52:13.089
Doyle-Murray:
Don't be embarrassed, my son.

52:13.215 --> 52:14.341
I've heard it all before.

52:14.508 --> 52:16.009
I've heard much,
much worse than that.

52:16.259 --> 52:17.260
Murray: You heard cunnilingus?

52:17.427 --> 52:19.012
Doyle-Murray: I hear that from
second graders.

52:19.179 --> 52:20.722
Murray: Wow. Wobbly warhead,
you heard that?

52:20.889 --> 52:21.932
Slam the warhead at her?

52:22.098 --> 52:23.266
Doyle-Murray:
Years ago, years ago.

52:23.433 --> 52:24.684
Murray: Low clearance clit?
You heard that?

52:24.851 --> 52:26.852
- Doyle-Murray: Dwarf cock.
- Murray: Bosom burger?

52:26.937 --> 52:28.522
- Doyle-Murray: Scrotum breath.
- Murray: Albino beaver?

52:28.647 --> 52:30.273
- Doyle-Murray: Iguana tits.
- Murray: Madam ovary?

52:30.440 --> 52:32.400
- Doyle-Murray: Slime slit.
- Murray: Mashy nipple lick?

52:32.526 --> 52:33.777
- Murray: Bug nuts.
- Doyle-Murray: Cock nose?

52:33.902 --> 52:35.320
- Doyle-Murray: Vagina.
- Murray: Oriental crack?

52:35.445 --> 52:36.321
Doyle-Murray: Superdome pussy.

52:36.446 --> 52:37.697
Murray: Afterbirth on toast,
it's pizza.

52:37.864 --> 52:39.407
- Doyle-Murray: Punk piss.
- Murray: Hillbilly snatch.

52:39.533 --> 52:41.409
- Doyle-Murray: Boob puss.
- Murray: You heard Rhino Clit?

52:41.576 --> 52:43.745
Doyle-Murray: Rhino Clit?
That's disgusting.

52:43.912 --> 52:45.080
That's terrible.

52:45.247 --> 52:47.249
Nice mouth, you kiss your
mother with that mouth?

52:47.415 --> 52:48.959
You eat with that mouth?

52:49.292 --> 52:50.710
Garbage mouth!

52:51.878 --> 52:54.297
Man: Well, the Nat Lamp,
as it is affectionately called

52:54.464 --> 52:57.717
by both its friends and enemies,
has taken its anarchism off its pages

52:57.884 --> 53:00.428
and put it on the stage
in revue form.

53:00.679 --> 53:03.265
They are the cast of the new
National Lampoon show,

53:03.431 --> 53:06.101
which opens this Friday
at the new Palladium Cabaret

53:06.268 --> 53:08.520
at 120 West 51st Street.

53:08.812 --> 53:10.814
I've given up a life
of comfort and wealth.

53:10.981 --> 53:12.733
Surely you can send something.

53:12.899 --> 53:16.278
A dime, a dollar,
a pair of socks,

53:16.444 --> 53:19.573
some 50 caliber tracer bullets
or whatever you can to...

53:19.739 --> 53:21.408
The Symbionese Liberation Army.

53:21.575 --> 53:22.993
That's the SLA in L.A.,

53:23.159 --> 53:26.204
418 Tishman Building,
Los Angeles, California.

53:27.747 --> 53:29.540
I was reading the magazine.

53:29.708 --> 53:31.428
I was very impressed
with the writing in it,

53:31.585 --> 53:33.169
so I looked up on the masthead

53:33.336 --> 53:35.881
and found Matty Simmons'
name and called him.

53:36.047 --> 53:38.925
He had seen the
National Lampoon show in Toronto.

53:39.092 --> 53:42.095
Matty decided to do
another stage show,

53:42.262 --> 53:44.890
using Bill Murray,
Gilda Radner, Harold Ramis,

53:45.056 --> 53:47.601
and much of the same talent
in the Radio Hour.

53:47.767 --> 53:49.060
So I said to Ivan,

53:49.227 --> 53:52.022
"Why don't you come in
and run it in New York?"

53:52.188 --> 53:56.693
And now the National Lampoon
Radio Hour single's bar of the air.

53:56.860 --> 53:59.738
Your opportunity to meet some of
today's most beautiful, bright,

53:59.905 --> 54:02.949
talented, sensitive, and unattached
young men and women.

54:03.116 --> 54:04.701
Will that perfect mate be you?

54:05.744 --> 54:07.162
Hiya, fella.

54:07.329 --> 54:09.080
Nice weather, isn't it?

54:09.372 --> 54:11.958
I used to believe
in ethical culture,

54:12.125 --> 54:13.710
but then I switched to Zen.

54:14.169 --> 54:17.547
My hobbies are plants,
and once I had an ant farm.

54:17.714 --> 54:19.633
Ivan Reitman: I showed up to one
of the early rehearsals,

54:19.799 --> 54:21.343
and there was,
kind of, a discussion

54:21.509 --> 54:23.219
about some little thing
that's going on.

54:23.386 --> 54:25.722
And I just naturally say,
"Well, wouldn't it be better

54:25.889 --> 54:27.515
if you..."
I made some suggestion.

54:27.682 --> 54:29.122
And suddenly the whole
group stopped,

54:29.267 --> 54:30.644
and they looked at me,

54:30.769 --> 54:33.438
this outsider, and wondered,
"Did he just say something?"

54:33.605 --> 54:36.900
Did he have the nerve to actually
open up his mouth and direct us?

54:37.817 --> 54:39.578
Bill Murray,
always the bravest of the group,

54:39.736 --> 54:42.113
sort of walked up
to me very calmly,

54:42.405 --> 54:44.908
put his arm around me
and patted me on my back,

54:45.075 --> 54:49.329
got my winter scarf and wrapped it
very slowly around my neck.

54:49.955 --> 54:53.291
And said, "Hey, thanks for
dropping in, we'll see you."

54:53.458 --> 54:56.544
And he patted me,
and he ushered me out of the room.

54:56.711 --> 54:58.546
It was very, very embarrassing.

54:59.172 --> 55:00.382
Better luck next time.

55:00.548 --> 55:01.675
Rehearsal warm-up!

55:01.841 --> 55:03.322
Let's take first
to the right eyebrow.

55:03.385 --> 55:05.553
Ready, and one and two

55:05.720 --> 55:08.723
and three and four
and five and six.

55:08.890 --> 55:10.392
Now left, and two.

55:10.558 --> 55:12.435
Come on! Up! Down!

55:12.602 --> 55:14.854
And halt.
Cross, and...

55:15.021 --> 55:16.861
Reitman: Belushi was this sure
great performer.

55:17.023 --> 55:19.943
He was the center
of The National Lampoon Show.

55:20.110 --> 55:22.320
He, basically,
acted as the director.

55:22.487 --> 55:23.530
What are you doing here?

55:23.780 --> 55:24.781
- Who me?
- Yeah.

55:25.407 --> 55:27.659
[music] Well, I'm a congressman
from Cleveland [music]

55:28.159 --> 55:30.411
[music] I took kickbacks
all the time [music]

55:30.912 --> 55:33.123
[music] Now I'm stuck here
in prison for them [music]

55:33.707 --> 55:35.750
- [music] Doing 99 [music]
- Years?

55:35.917 --> 55:37.210
- No, hours.
- Wow.

55:37.377 --> 55:39.377
Ramis: [music] I'm a white
collar criminal [music]

55:39.921 --> 55:42.257
[music] My wife's a debutante [music]

55:43.174 --> 55:46.678
[music] I'm stuck in prison farm
for as long as I want [music]

55:46.845 --> 55:48.638
[music] Whoa... [music]

55:49.305 --> 55:51.474
Hendra: What was really
remarkable about John was that

55:51.641 --> 55:53.852
he was the rock'n'roll of humor.

55:54.019 --> 55:57.731
I mean, he represented those
two things in perfect combination.

55:58.857 --> 56:00.650
[music] You know,
we gotta eat caviar [music]

56:00.817 --> 56:01.901
Yeah!

56:02.360 --> 56:03.862
[music] We got a chauffeur
and a car [music]

56:04.029 --> 56:05.322
Whoa!

56:05.613 --> 56:07.907
[music] We got a church
and a school [music]

56:08.074 --> 56:11.202
[music] We got a sauna
and a pool... Whoa! [music]

56:11.369 --> 56:14.330
[music] Six months
on prison farm... [music]

56:15.081 --> 56:17.792
He was very focused on
the business side of it as well.

56:18.043 --> 56:19.419
He was the one who
would call me up every week

56:19.586 --> 56:21.004
and say, "Hey, you're not
advertising enough"

56:21.171 --> 56:23.423
or "We should put
these quotes on."

56:23.590 --> 56:24.924
[music] My honey [music]

56:25.091 --> 56:30.263
[music] Told her to save
my tennis things [music]

56:33.558 --> 56:36.227
Hirsch: I think it was
Sean who said to Matty,

56:36.394 --> 56:40.231
put him on retainer.
Give him $500 a week

56:41.357 --> 56:43.109
just to keep him here.

56:43.318 --> 56:44.736
And Matty didn't do it.

56:45.987 --> 56:47.280
Let's begin.

56:48.990 --> 56:50.658
Repeat after me.

56:51.326 --> 56:53.328
- I would like
- I would like

56:53.495 --> 56:54.579
to feed your fingertips

56:54.746 --> 56:56.164
to feed your fingertips

56:56.331 --> 56:58.416
- to the wolverines.
- To the wolverines.

56:58.583 --> 57:00.251
(laughter)

57:00.418 --> 57:03.254
- Next, I am afraid
- I am afraid

57:03.421 --> 57:04.881
- we are out
- we are out

57:05.006 --> 57:06.382
- of badgers.
- Of badgers.

57:06.549 --> 57:08.426
- Would you accept
- Would you accept

57:08.593 --> 57:10.303
- a wolverine
- a wolverine

57:10.470 --> 57:12.263
- in its place?
- In its place?

57:13.681 --> 57:14.933
Next...
(gasps)

57:21.356 --> 57:23.024
(gasps)

57:23.191 --> 57:25.110
(applause)

57:28.738 --> 57:30.406
(inaudible)

57:31.324 --> 57:34.410
Live from New York,
it's Saturday Night!

57:36.454 --> 57:38.414
Most of the cast
oi Saturday Night Live

57:38.581 --> 57:40.792
was taken right from
the first company

57:41.000 --> 57:42.376
of The National Lampoon Show.

57:42.502 --> 57:44.879
Announcer:
Starring the Not For Ready

57:45.004 --> 57:46.506
Primetime Players!

57:46.673 --> 57:50.885
The producer of Saturday Night Live
watched our show for about a month

57:51.052 --> 57:52.762
and then hired
the people in the show.

57:52.887 --> 57:54.597
Tom Snyder: You're talking about
Lorne Michaels, who produces?

57:54.764 --> 57:55.885
Oh, yeah, I forgot his name.

57:55.974 --> 57:58.226
Lorne Michaels...
No, I know his name.

57:58.393 --> 58:00.233
- Are you mad at him?
- No, I'm not mad at him.

58:00.270 --> 58:03.148
Since he has most of my actors
and many of my writers.

58:04.357 --> 58:05.775
You could almost feel the energy

58:05.942 --> 58:08.736
sucked out of the magazine
and into that show.

58:08.903 --> 58:10.613
It was written
by some Lampoon people.

58:10.780 --> 58:12.615
It was starring some former
Lampoon people.

58:12.782 --> 58:15.952
And it was very glamorous,
and it was a huge hit,

58:16.119 --> 58:18.621
from the beginning,
and I gathered pretty quickly

58:18.788 --> 58:20.582
that if I liked
Saturday Night Live,

58:20.748 --> 58:21.828
I should keep it to myself.

58:21.916 --> 58:23.918
Rick Meyerowitz: Suddenly,
what the Lampoon offered

58:24.085 --> 58:27.130
was available
to a much larger audience.

58:27.505 --> 58:30.216
The Lampoon lost its exceptionalism.

58:30.425 --> 58:33.386
[music] (music plays) [music]

58:43.688 --> 58:45.690
[music] What would ya do [music]

58:45.857 --> 58:48.568
[music] If I sang out of tune [music]

58:48.735 --> 58:50.153
(applause)

58:50.320 --> 58:52.864
[music] Would you stand up
and walk out on me? [music]

58:53.031 --> 58:55.242
[music] Oh, baby,
I get high [music]

58:55.408 --> 58:58.119
[music] With a little help
from my friends [music]

58:58.286 --> 59:03.291
[music] Oh, yeah, whoa... [music]

59:03.458 --> 59:06.753
I've described the Lampoon as the
hippest place to be to write comedy.

59:06.920 --> 59:08.213
And it was,

59:08.379 --> 59:10.924
until the hippest place
to be to write comedy

59:11.090 --> 59:12.759
became Saturday Night Live.

59:14.093 --> 59:16.346
Chevy Chase came over
to the Lampoon offices,

59:16.512 --> 59:18.181
and, chuckling, he said,

59:18.348 --> 59:21.059
"Nobody gets laid writing for
the National Lampoon anymore."

59:30.568 --> 59:33.029
This friend of mine
tells me that Michael Gross

59:33.238 --> 59:34.864
is leaving the Lampoon,
the art director,

59:35.031 --> 59:36.366
and I should apply for the job.

59:36.658 --> 59:40.828
And, I walk into the conference room,
and Doug Kenney says to me,

59:40.995 --> 59:44.791
"Well, I have three questions:
Can you get us drugs?"

59:44.958 --> 59:46.918
"Can you get us nude models?"

59:47.085 --> 59:48.725
"And do you have some place
where we can go"

59:48.753 --> 59:50.463
"with the drugs
and the nude models?"

59:51.673 --> 59:53.758
And I thought very seriously

59:53.925 --> 59:58.554
and I said,
"Yes, yes, and yes."

59:59.597 --> 01:00:02.398
And Doug looked at me and he says,
"Well, I have no further questions."

01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:05.353
[music] (King Floyd's
"Groove Me" plays) [music]

01:00:07.814 --> 01:00:09.440
Abelson:
Peter had very little pretension

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:11.901
in terms of art,
as did Michael Gross.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.196
Totally different kind of person
but he got it, you know,

01:00:15.363 --> 01:00:16.948
and that's the thing
that mattered.

01:00:17.115 --> 01:00:20.076
He was a great looking guy who
was not afraid to approach

01:00:20.243 --> 01:00:22.662
people of the opposite sex
and suggest

01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:24.669
that they might get
to know one another better,

01:00:24.831 --> 01:00:26.749
which was somewhat fascinating
to all of us.

01:00:27.417 --> 01:00:30.378
Every 30 days we were putting out
this 100-page magazine.

01:00:30.545 --> 01:00:33.506
Didn't matter how dirty,
or how vile, or how perverted,

01:00:33.673 --> 01:00:36.551
or how sexual, or how twisted
or violent it was.

01:00:36.718 --> 01:00:39.470
If it was funny,
and if Doug liked it, it was in.

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:50.315
Simmons:
We knew all along that Doug

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:51.983
and Henry Beard and Rob Hoffman

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:54.652
would ask us to buy them out
after five years.

01:00:54.819 --> 01:01:00.616
However, the buyout said
that they would buy it out

01:01:00.783 --> 01:01:05.079
at 21 times earnings,
which was outrageous.

01:01:05.246 --> 01:01:07.790
They stood to make
a nice piece of change.

01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:10.543
I owed them seven and a half
million dollars.

01:01:11.294 --> 01:01:14.005
So we met with them
and we sat down and we talked.

01:01:14.964 --> 01:01:18.885
For whatever reason,
any reasonable alternative

01:01:19.052 --> 01:01:21.429
to the buyout was rejected.

01:01:22.764 --> 01:01:25.225
So when push came to shove,
we shoved.

01:01:25.391 --> 01:01:27.018
I don't think Matty
was prepared.

01:01:27.185 --> 01:01:30.230
I don't think Matty Simmons
really thought Doug and Henry

01:01:30.355 --> 01:01:31.356
would go through with it.

01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:33.649
And they did.

01:01:41.366 --> 01:01:45.703
Henry hinted a few times that,
you know,

01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:49.499
this could be good for you guys.
Meaning Sean, Tony and myself.

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:53.711
O'Rourke: Other people apparently
felt that they were stake holders.

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:58.132
And, um, you know, they weren't.

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:01.886
They all thought Henry had
promised them a lot of money

01:02:02.053 --> 01:02:05.056
and he walked out of that office
the day the check was cashed.

01:02:05.223 --> 01:02:07.703
He stood up on a desk and said,
"I hated every minute of this."

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:10.061
"Fuck you!" Then left.

01:02:11.187 --> 01:02:13.272
Kelly:
When Henry got up and told us

01:02:13.439 --> 01:02:15.149
that he was never going to talk
to any of us again,

01:02:15.316 --> 01:02:18.152
it was such a shattering
experience for all of us

01:02:18.319 --> 01:02:20.863
because he was the one
we were trying to please.

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:22.615
I think the culture changed.

01:02:22.782 --> 01:02:26.119
And you know, people grew up.
It had a lifespan.

01:02:30.164 --> 01:02:31.457
Radio Announcer:
Never send care packages

01:02:31.624 --> 01:02:33.209
to the so-called starving families

01:02:33.376 --> 01:02:35.795
in Europe because they're not
starving at all.

01:02:35.962 --> 01:02:38.423
Can you afford to live in Europe?
No.

01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:40.091
You can't even afford
to visit Europe.

01:02:40.258 --> 01:02:42.760
And do you know what they do
with the care packages you send?

01:02:42.927 --> 01:02:44.448
They whack them
with their polo mallets

01:02:44.554 --> 01:02:46.114
and kick them into
their swimming pools.

01:02:46.889 --> 01:02:49.392
The first time I saw Doug
after the buyout,

01:02:49.559 --> 01:02:52.187
I said, "What are you going to
do with all of this bread?"

01:02:52.353 --> 01:02:53.604
"That's so great!"

01:02:53.771 --> 01:02:55.731
And Doug said,
"I'm going to Disneyland."

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.068
[music] (rock music plays) [music]

01:02:59.235 --> 01:03:00.445
Doug was going to quit.

01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:02.331
He was wealthy now
and he was going to quit.

01:03:02.488 --> 01:03:04.532
And Matty was smart enough
to know that

01:03:04.699 --> 01:03:06.409
"Holy shit, if I lose Doug,

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:08.738
I'm going to lose the heart
and soul of this company."

01:03:09.078 --> 01:03:10.599
And so he said,
"Well, don't quit Doug,

01:03:10.705 --> 01:03:13.291
we're going to make a movie."
And Doug went, "Really?"

01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:15.978
Once I told Doug we were making a
movie, we had to make a movie.

01:03:16.669 --> 01:03:20.047
Ivan then started coming up
with ideas with Harold Ramis.

01:03:20.298 --> 01:03:22.091
Reitman: I knew that the
High School Yearbook

01:03:22.258 --> 01:03:23.843
was the most popular thing

01:03:24.719 --> 01:03:26.429
that the National Lampoon
had ever put out.

01:03:26.596 --> 01:03:28.681
So I called up Doug Kenney
and said,

01:03:28.848 --> 01:03:31.976
"Hey, why don't you help Harold
write this high school movie?"

01:03:32.143 --> 01:03:33.784
They started writing
a screenplay that was

01:03:33.895 --> 01:03:35.813
Charlie Manson and his followers

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:37.732
back when they were still
in high school.

01:03:37.899 --> 01:03:40.902
There was so much sex
and drinking and what have you

01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:45.072
involved with it that I said,
"We can't do this in high school.

01:03:45.531 --> 01:03:46.532
We'll get lynched."

01:03:46.699 --> 01:03:48.060
[music] (rock music plays) [music]

01:03:48.242 --> 01:03:51.370
So I spoke to Matty about shifting
away from high school to college

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:55.041
and we were thinking of using
Chris Miller's stories.

01:03:55.208 --> 01:03:58.545
Simmons: Chris Miller was the
most popular short story writer

01:03:58.711 --> 01:03:59.962
in the history of the Lampoon.

01:04:00.129 --> 01:04:03.382
Reitman: He specialized in stories
based on his Dartmouth years.

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:05.355
Chris Miller:
My stories were about college

01:04:05.593 --> 01:04:07.803
and getting loaded
and living a wild life

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:09.680
and sex, drugs and rock'n'roll,

01:04:09.972 --> 01:04:11.682
or the absence of those things.

01:04:12.475 --> 01:04:13.893
Doug Kenney went crazy over it

01:04:14.143 --> 01:04:16.312
because they didn't do
shit like that at Harvard.

01:04:16.479 --> 01:04:18.040
Simmons:
Ramis, Kenney and Miller worked

01:04:18.147 --> 01:04:21.526
for a full year on what became
a 114 page treatment.

01:04:21.692 --> 01:04:23.528
The biggest treatment
anyone's ever seen.

01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:27.156
And so, that really
became Animal House.

01:04:30.576 --> 01:04:31.827
(rock music stops)

01:04:31.994 --> 01:04:35.706
After the buyout,
we bumped along until P.J.

01:04:35.873 --> 01:04:37.833
took the title of Editor-in-Chief.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.504
[music] (The Hombres
"Let It All Hang Out" plays) [music]

01:04:42.797 --> 01:04:46.217
I went to work as Matty's assistant
but I wound up as Editor-in-Chief

01:04:46.384 --> 01:04:49.470
because I had had some prior
publishing experience.

01:04:49.637 --> 01:04:52.640
I actually knew what on time
and under budget meant.

01:04:52.807 --> 01:04:55.727
The era of P.J. being
the Editor-in-Chief,

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:58.688
it was less high-brow
and more approachable.

01:04:59.105 --> 01:05:00.856
Editorial meetings
were way different.

01:05:01.023 --> 01:05:04.026
Before he was editor,
editorial meetings were hanging out

01:05:04.193 --> 01:05:05.820
and trying to one-up each other

01:05:05.987 --> 01:05:08.072
and consisted of
this free-flow of ideas.

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:12.118
When P.J. took over,
he was the chair of every meeting.

01:05:12.285 --> 01:05:13.645
He had an agenda on his legal pad.

01:05:13.703 --> 01:05:15.121
He would read us things
that he had written

01:05:15.288 --> 01:05:16.914
that he thought were
particularly funny.

01:05:17.832 --> 01:05:21.002
P.J. was one of those people
that really worked hard.

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:23.504
It was not an endearing quality.

01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:30.803
It needed a grown-up,
but frankly, it stopped being fun.

01:05:34.682 --> 01:05:37.018
"How to talk your wife into oral sex:"

01:05:37.727 --> 01:05:42.649
"Beg, wheedle, plead,
moan, groan and whine."

01:05:42.815 --> 01:05:45.693
"The object being to have
her grab it in disgust"

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.779
"and perform the dirty deed
to shut you up."

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:51.032
By John Hughes.

01:05:51.198 --> 01:05:54.827
[music] (rock music plays) [music]

01:05:54.994 --> 01:05:57.079
Apatow: I was always an
enormous fan of John Hughes.

01:05:57.246 --> 01:06:00.458
He did all of this humor
about families and growing up

01:06:00.625 --> 01:06:03.419
and then really funny,
dirty stuff.

01:06:07.173 --> 01:06:08.453
When I was running the magazine,

01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:09.925
he was the best person
I had working for me.

01:06:10.217 --> 01:06:13.929
John could hue within,
sort of, one degree of reality

01:06:14.096 --> 01:06:15.181
and make it hilarious.

01:06:15.848 --> 01:06:18.288
Peter Kleinman: On the surface,
he was all-American, you know,

01:06:18.434 --> 01:06:20.436
almost like this nice family guy.

01:06:20.936 --> 01:06:23.522
And then you'd start
reading his stuff,

01:06:23.689 --> 01:06:27.068
and it was the most sick,
sexual, depraved,

01:06:27.234 --> 01:06:28.819
deviant stuff you've ever read.

01:06:31.822 --> 01:06:35.117
P.J. O'Rourke and John Hughes
and the kinds of articles they liked

01:06:35.284 --> 01:06:37.787
and wrote and edited
were politically different

01:06:37.953 --> 01:06:40.514
and culturally and socially different
than the stuff we had done.

01:06:40.581 --> 01:06:42.708
And the kinds of readers
changed also.

01:06:44.502 --> 01:06:46.462
Simmons:
I knew no one in Hollywood,

01:06:46.629 --> 01:06:49.173
but this is one of those things
that has to happen.

01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:54.512
You have to have luck
to go with talent.

01:06:57.390 --> 01:07:01.060
I got a phone call about a week
later from a guy who said,

01:07:01.227 --> 01:07:03.563
"Mr. Simmons,
I am the assistant to Ned Tanen"

01:07:03.729 --> 01:07:06.524
"at Universal Studios,
and I just want you to know"

01:07:06.691 --> 01:07:10.319
"that I'm a huge Lampoon freak
and if you ever want"

01:07:10.486 --> 01:07:12.113
"to do a movie, please call me."

01:07:12.363 --> 01:07:15.366
We met with Ned Tanen and he said,
"I hate this."

01:07:15.533 --> 01:07:19.203
"Everybody's a drunkard, a womanizer,
they're doing drugs."

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:22.540
But he had two assistants:
Sean Daniel and Thom Mount,

01:07:22.707 --> 01:07:24.583
who had always thought
this project could work.

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:25.793
And they were pushing it.

01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:27.253
As a National Lampoon fan,

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:30.006
I just thought this is hilarious.

01:07:30.172 --> 01:07:33.008
Not everyone thought it was
as funny as I did.

01:07:33.175 --> 01:07:36.512
In fact, it was held
in total contempt.

01:07:37.304 --> 01:07:40.641
My deal was that if any part
of the National Lampoon show,

01:07:40.808 --> 01:07:44.103
which I produced, sort of,
led to what was going to be

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:45.980
a National Lampoon movie

01:07:46.147 --> 01:07:48.607
then I was going to have
the opportunity to direct it.

01:07:48.774 --> 01:07:50.776
But the only film I had directed
up to that point

01:07:50.943 --> 01:07:53.654
was, uh, Cannibal Girls.

01:07:53.821 --> 01:07:55.462
Announcer: They love
every man they meet.

01:07:56.532 --> 01:07:59.118
First to death, then for dinner.

01:08:00.494 --> 01:08:03.372
Universal said, "Well, you can
produce it but you can't direct it."

01:08:03.706 --> 01:08:05.583
My girlfriend at the time
was working as

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:08.043
a script supervisor
on Kentucky Fried Movie.

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:10.337
She said to me
you have got to get to know

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:12.065
the director of this movie,
John Landis.

01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:15.885
Sean approached me and said,
"Would you be interested

01:08:16.051 --> 01:08:18.595
in making a film at Universal?"

01:08:18.763 --> 01:08:21.474
And I was like, "Duh", and, uh,

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.559
he gave me
the script to Animal House.

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:25.406
Ned Tanen took me
into his office and said,

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.979
"Look, a lot of people
around here hate this"

01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:29.398
"and don't think
we should be doing it."

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:30.816
"But if you believe in it,"

01:08:30.983 --> 01:08:32.984
"go away and bring us back
a movie."

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:40.075
You can't spend your whole life
worrying about your mistakes.

01:08:40.242 --> 01:08:42.620
You fucked up!
You trusted us!

01:08:44.997 --> 01:08:46.415
I had never done a comedy,

01:08:46.582 --> 01:08:49.376
and I just was so over
where my career was.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.545
I was like,
"I have to be in this movie."

01:08:51.712 --> 01:08:53.255
(loud crack)

01:08:53.339 --> 01:08:54.799
Thank you, sir.
May I have another?

01:08:56.675 --> 01:08:58.036
Bacon:
I auditioned for John Landis

01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:00.554
and he said,
"Yeah, this guy is smarmy,

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.224
he's a smarmy guy.
Can ya do that?"

01:09:03.599 --> 01:09:05.350
I had no idea
what the word smarmy meant,

01:09:05.518 --> 01:09:10.104
so I just, kind of, made this face
and he was like, "That's great!"

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:13.859
My kid can't see, is it all right
if he stands in front of you?

01:09:14.026 --> 01:09:15.027
No!

01:09:16.904 --> 01:09:18.738
Landis: I really wanted
the writers on set.

01:09:18.906 --> 01:09:21.158
Universal of course,
this is a low-budget picture,

01:09:21.325 --> 01:09:22.827
told me to go fuck myself, so...

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:26.872
What I did, was I said,
"Look, get yourself to Eugene

01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:29.375
and I will hire you
every day as actors."

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:31.794
Chris and Doug
being there was important.

01:09:32.086 --> 01:09:35.923
And Doug Kenney,
really important because,

01:09:36.131 --> 01:09:38.008
you know, we made up a lot
of stuff shooting.

01:09:38.175 --> 01:09:40.426
What the hell
we supposed to do, you moron?

01:09:40.594 --> 01:09:42.470
Doug was always the smartest guy
in the room,

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.765
you know, and the richest guy.
(chuckling)

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.725
And the one with the drugs.

01:09:47.017 --> 01:09:50.062
So, it was a real special time
because it was a chance

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:52.689
to meet all these people
that I had always revered.

01:09:52.857 --> 01:09:55.943
You know, the Lampoon
and that Doug had founded it

01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:59.363
and was as smart in person
and funny in person

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:01.782
as the magazine was.

01:10:01.949 --> 01:10:03.951
Landis: I know that for Doug,
he was in heaven.

01:10:04.326 --> 01:10:05.536
He had the time of his life.

01:10:07.997 --> 01:10:11.250
But Ned Tanen was very upset
about it and very concerned

01:10:11.417 --> 01:10:13.669
and really we were in trouble
for a while.

01:10:13.919 --> 01:10:15.462
When he saw the movie he just...

01:10:15.921 --> 01:10:19.341
He didn't like it and, uh,
didn't find any of it funny.

01:10:22.094 --> 01:10:23.774
Sean Daniel:
Came time to preview the movie

01:10:23.929 --> 01:10:26.807
in front of
an actual paying audience,

01:10:27.266 --> 01:10:29.268
the president
of the corporation came,

01:10:29.435 --> 01:10:32.313
who had been one of
the non-believers.

01:10:33.772 --> 01:10:36.358
And all of
the executives were there.

01:10:36.525 --> 01:10:39.945
The time has come for someone
to put his foot down,

01:10:40.988 --> 01:10:43.073
and that foot is me.

01:10:43.574 --> 01:10:45.409
It was, you know,
you're sitting there very nervous,

01:10:45.576 --> 01:10:46.816
"How will they like the movie?"

01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:49.830
(screaming)

01:10:50.039 --> 01:10:51.123
They went nuts.

01:10:51.373 --> 01:10:53.083
(cheering)

01:10:54.752 --> 01:10:57.546
Suddenly the studio went,
"Oh, my God, this really worked."

01:10:57.838 --> 01:10:59.423
Landis:
And from that moment on,

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:03.093
we went from being criminals...
Suspects to heroes.

01:11:07.681 --> 01:11:11.143
I remember seeing it with my mom.
It was the first time I saw

01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:13.520
women's breasts
in front of my mother.

01:11:13.938 --> 01:11:15.815
I literally can remember how
many people were in the theater

01:11:15.981 --> 01:11:19.026
and what it looked like
and my red shamed face.

01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:22.905
And you have to remember that
Animal House created a genre.

01:11:23.072 --> 01:11:25.449
[music] (Bobby Lewis
"Tossin' and Turnin'" plays) [music]

01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:29.411
So we figured,
"Wow, this is awesome."

01:11:29.578 --> 01:11:31.038
Everybody's going to love
the magazine now

01:11:31.205 --> 01:11:33.040
and see that we're more
mainstream because of this movie

01:11:33.207 --> 01:11:34.792
which was a huge success.

01:11:35.209 --> 01:11:36.710
What we didn't anticipate

01:11:36.877 --> 01:11:40.631
was that Hollywood now would
rear it's voracious head

01:11:40.798 --> 01:11:46.095
and take away all of our wonderful,
creative talent.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.264
The second it came out somebody
hired me to write about

01:11:49.431 --> 01:11:51.976
college kids drinking
and having sex in cars

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:54.895
and everybody wanted
to have a meeting even if...

01:11:55.062 --> 01:11:56.897
And I had nothing to do
with the movie.

01:11:57.064 --> 01:11:59.358
I just worked at
the Lampoon for a while.

01:11:59.775 --> 01:12:03.779
(jet engine roar)

01:12:10.119 --> 01:12:12.162
Chris Miller:
Doug came out to Hollywood

01:12:12.329 --> 01:12:14.456
and the search for joy
and for ecstasy

01:12:14.623 --> 01:12:16.792
was a major fact of life.

01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:19.420
It was what we did.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.520
[music] (Bobby Blue Bland
"Turn On Your Love Light" Plays) [music]

01:12:23.841 --> 01:12:25.926
Beard: I realized that this is
what he wanted to do.

01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:28.512
I mean, Doug Kenney
should be writing movies.

01:12:28.679 --> 01:12:29.847
He was a producer.

01:12:34.852 --> 01:12:37.521
He seemed to be running
the whole show.

01:12:37.688 --> 01:12:39.982
He was the engine that was
making the wheels turn.

01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:43.736
[music] (music continues) [music]

01:12:43.902 --> 01:12:45.779
Doug was just
an upward road to fame.

01:12:48.782 --> 01:12:50.492
Beverly D'Angelo: I remember
going to Doug Kenney's house

01:12:50.659 --> 01:12:51.952
when I first came to Hollywood.

01:12:52.119 --> 01:12:53.370
They were having
the most fun in town.

01:12:53.537 --> 01:12:55.122
They were what was
going on in town.

01:12:58.125 --> 01:13:02.796
Belushi: There was that part of him
that enjoyed being a star.

01:13:10.596 --> 01:13:12.973
Kleinman: Doug and Chevy
had this great chemistry.

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.559
They could start going
and you'd just sit back

01:13:15.726 --> 01:13:17.311
and just watch the party.

01:13:17.728 --> 01:13:20.272
He considered himself the most
handsome man in comedy.

01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:22.649
He'd be in front
of the mirror and say,

01:13:22.816 --> 01:13:25.652
"Look the most handsome man
in comedy."

01:13:25.819 --> 01:13:29.073
And then I'd stand behind him
and go, "Almost."

01:13:34.787 --> 01:13:36.622
Hendra: Wherever Doug was
would be a party.

01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:40.501
Just full of people,
studio heads and guys from Denny's.

01:13:40.667 --> 01:13:42.336
You know, I mean,
just anyone he met.

01:13:42.503 --> 01:13:44.263
And it would go on for hours,
sometimes days.

01:14:17.037 --> 01:14:18.497
Kleinman: Doug's career was
really taking off,

01:14:18.664 --> 01:14:20.082
and meanwhile back at the ranch,

01:14:20.249 --> 01:14:22.876
everyone was making
Disco Beavers From Outer Space.

01:14:23.043 --> 01:14:25.629
[music] Disco beaver [music]

01:14:25.796 --> 01:14:28.423
[music] From outer space... [music]

01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:30.717
There was a giant beaver
walking around

01:14:30.884 --> 01:14:32.719
throughout everything
eating the floors.

01:14:32.886 --> 01:14:35.305
So in the middle of the sketch,
the floor would collapse

01:14:35.472 --> 01:14:37.683
and this beaver, who had eaten it,
would pop up.

01:14:39.643 --> 01:14:42.146
Do I really have to talk
about Disco Beaver?

01:14:42.312 --> 01:14:44.064
[music] Disco beaver... [music]

01:14:45.983 --> 01:14:47.443
Somebody at the Lampoon
called me and said,

01:14:47.609 --> 01:14:50.362
"Look we have a whole bunch of
kids coming in from Harvard..."

01:14:50.529 --> 01:14:55.117
[music] (rock music plays) [music]

01:14:55.284 --> 01:14:57.084
"...and we'd like you to come
to the magazine"

01:14:57.244 --> 01:14:58.829
"and just, kind of,
tutor these guys."

01:14:58.996 --> 01:15:00.831
I thought, okay,
that sounds like fun.

01:15:02.875 --> 01:15:04.635
Reiss: My first week
at the National Lampoon,

01:15:04.668 --> 01:15:07.421
we were getting drunk at a park
with bagpipers there.

01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:08.881
I saw a fistfight.

01:15:09.173 --> 01:15:11.508
There was a man secretly
living in his office.

01:15:11.675 --> 01:15:15.679
It was... It was a crazy place,
like nothing I had ever seen before.

01:15:15.846 --> 01:15:18.286
And, you know, for a guy just
out of college this was a dream.

01:15:18.432 --> 01:15:20.142
You know, you were able to
actually write comedy for a living,

01:15:20.267 --> 01:15:21.347
which was astounding to me.

01:15:21.393 --> 01:15:23.553
One thing that Mike and I did early,
was these articles

01:15:23.562 --> 01:15:26.148
about how to write. And we did
one that Thurgood Marshall,

01:15:26.315 --> 01:15:28.400
the Supreme Court Justice did,
How to Write Dirty,

01:15:28.567 --> 01:15:30.736
where he instructed you
how to write pornography.

01:15:31.445 --> 01:15:33.572
I had the thought
that Thurgood Marshall,

01:15:33.739 --> 01:15:35.579
he would never see this article,
but if he did,

01:15:35.657 --> 01:15:37.742
I thought maybe he would
even enjoy it, right?

01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:41.038
He was so upset that
he called the FBI and said,

01:15:41.205 --> 01:15:42.414
"What can I do to them?"

01:15:42.915 --> 01:15:44.708
And the FBI said,
"Well, there's a thing

01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:47.711
called Freedom of Speech,
Mr. Justice, it protects them."

01:15:56.303 --> 01:15:57.804
McConnachie:
After Animal House,

01:15:57.971 --> 01:16:00.474
Harold and Doug went up to
Florida and made Caddyshack.

01:16:00.641 --> 01:16:03.268
Caddyshack
was not a Lampoon movie,

01:16:03.435 --> 01:16:07.231
but it was a Doug Kenney movie
and Doug Kenney was the Lampoon,

01:16:07.397 --> 01:16:09.942
so obviously it was
a Lampoon movie.

01:16:10.108 --> 01:16:13.278
I mean, it may not have been
officially a Lampoon movie

01:16:13.445 --> 01:16:17.032
but with Chevy and Billy
and Doug and Brian,

01:16:17.199 --> 01:16:18.909
I mean, it was a Lampoon movie.

01:16:19.076 --> 01:16:21.161
That was the spirit
of the Lampoon.

01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:23.455
Doug was the producer
of Caddyshack

01:16:23.622 --> 01:16:26.750
but it all seemed
a little disorganized.

01:16:27.042 --> 01:16:29.294
There was a kind of
haphazard quality

01:16:29.461 --> 01:16:32.547
to the way in which
the film was created.

01:16:32.714 --> 01:16:34.090
Stop thinking.

01:16:35.008 --> 01:16:38.470
Let things happen
and be the ball.

01:16:41.181 --> 01:16:42.432
Danny? Danny?

01:16:42.808 --> 01:16:45.435
It was only, like, my second movie
or something, I don't remember.

01:16:45.602 --> 01:16:47.521
Everybody was smoking pot.

01:16:47.688 --> 01:16:48.688
(coughing)

01:16:48.814 --> 01:16:50.065
It's a little harsh.

01:16:50.399 --> 01:16:53.819
It was a very nocturnal,
uh, movie.

01:16:55.487 --> 01:16:56.571
(sniffing)

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:57.906
[music] (Kenny Loggins
"I'm Alight" plays) [music]

01:16:58.198 --> 01:16:59.866
Cocaine was just always there.

01:17:00.993 --> 01:17:03.329
Matheson: Cocaine wasn't bad for you.
You'd do this and you'd go,

01:17:03.495 --> 01:17:04.746
"I can't believe
this isn't bad for me!"

01:17:04.913 --> 01:17:07.249
You know, 'cause it wasn't
considered, at that time,

01:17:07.416 --> 01:17:10.877
to be a bad thing...
for a while.

01:17:16.008 --> 01:17:17.248
He's got a beautiful backswing.

01:17:17.342 --> 01:17:19.428
That's...
Oh, he got all of that one!

01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:21.305
Judd Apatow: I remember
when Caddyshack came out,

01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:22.912
Newsday gave it
two and a half stars,

01:17:22.973 --> 01:17:25.976
and I'm like, "What?
This is like the best movie ever!"

01:17:26.143 --> 01:17:28.645
Caddyshack is not about the
Mikado's daughter-in-law elect.

01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:31.453
It's about as rotten a movie as has
slopped the screen this summer.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.985
Tim Matheson:
Doug was very distraught

01:17:35.152 --> 01:17:37.821
and upset that Caddyshack
wasn't as big as Animal House.

01:17:37.988 --> 01:17:39.531
I said, "Jeez, you know,
Animal House is a homerun."

01:17:39.698 --> 01:17:42.701
"So let's just say Caddyshack is a
double or a triple. But who cares?"

01:17:42.868 --> 01:17:44.411
Chevy Chase:
But I was at Dangerfield's

01:17:44.578 --> 01:17:46.246
with Billy and maybe Harold

01:17:46.413 --> 01:17:49.791
promoting the picture
and somebody came up to me after

01:17:49.958 --> 01:17:52.002
and he said, "You know,
Doug is really..."

01:17:52.169 --> 01:17:55.297
And I could see that Doug
was like asleep on a table

01:17:55.464 --> 01:17:59.176
back there starting to get
loaded at noon or whatever.

01:17:59.343 --> 01:18:01.595
I had seen him depressed before
but this was like

01:18:01.762 --> 01:18:04.264
he had achieved a level of
depression that was impressive

01:18:04.431 --> 01:18:06.433
to me and I'm good
at being depressed.

01:18:06.767 --> 01:18:08.101
And it was about the movie.

01:18:09.311 --> 01:18:12.773
He'd spent a year and a half of
his life or something on this thing

01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:17.069
and what I got is like
a talking gopher for Christ's sake.

01:18:19.404 --> 01:18:23.158
It actually did fine, it kind of
hit the mark a lot of films do.

01:18:23.492 --> 01:18:25.035
It just wasn't his mark.

01:18:25.327 --> 01:18:28.705
So I guess that's probably part
of what happened to Doug,

01:18:28.872 --> 01:18:30.791
just feeling it should
have done better...

01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:33.919
...he could have done better.

01:18:37.255 --> 01:18:39.415
Sean Kelly: At that point
the magazine was on the skids

01:18:39.633 --> 01:18:40.926
in terms of its sales,

01:18:41.176 --> 01:18:43.929
and it was believed
by management

01:18:44.096 --> 01:18:49.810
that the way to get it back to being
a best-seller was to have more tits.

01:18:49.976 --> 01:18:54.064
[music] (rock music plays) [music]

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:59.986
Al Jean: They had this mandate that
every sixth issue or second issue

01:19:00.153 --> 01:19:02.447
or every issue had to be
a sex issue.

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:11.206
And we couldn't
afford B-List tits.

01:19:11.456 --> 01:19:14.292
We had like D and E-List tits.

01:19:16.086 --> 01:19:17.921
And the more tits and ass
we put on the cover,

01:19:18.088 --> 01:19:20.966
the more 7-11's and everybody
put it under the counter

01:19:21.174 --> 01:19:22.815
so it didn't matter
what was on the cover.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.850
Then the phone rang and they
said, "Do you want to quit"

01:19:30.016 --> 01:19:31.435
"your job and come to Hollywood?"

01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:33.478
And we said,
"Yes, who is this?"

01:19:33.728 --> 01:19:37.107
The kids left to go
write The Simpsons

01:19:37.357 --> 01:19:39.192
and every other thing
that's huge.

01:19:39.359 --> 01:19:41.445
We were in something
of a death spiral.

01:19:46.575 --> 01:19:48.935
Chris Miller: I was working on
a movie called Club Sandwich.

01:19:48.994 --> 01:19:50.912
We had to have a meeting
with our producers

01:19:51.079 --> 01:19:54.916
and that was Michael Shamberg
and Allen Greisman and Doug.

01:19:55.083 --> 01:19:56.334
And in comes Doug,

01:19:56.710 --> 01:19:59.129
and behind him
comes this coke dealer.

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:03.425
And, um, Doug says,
"I'll be right with you guys!"

01:20:04.134 --> 01:20:08.680
He lays a rail of this coke
along his arm, and he goes...

01:20:08.847 --> 01:20:10.015
(snorting)

01:20:10.182 --> 01:20:12.601
And the entire amount of cocaine
goes up his nose.

01:20:12.851 --> 01:20:15.187
And then he says, "Okay,
we're having a meeting now?"

01:20:15.353 --> 01:20:16.605
And, uh...

01:20:17.147 --> 01:20:21.151
I had been as big a drug abuser
as anybody,

01:20:21.401 --> 01:20:23.653
and I had hung around
with Doug a lot.

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:27.157
I had never seen Doug do
something like that at 9:00 a.m.

01:20:27.407 --> 01:20:29.409
when a business meeting
was about to be held.

01:20:30.243 --> 01:20:31.995
Tim Matheson: You know Hollywood
is one of those things.

01:20:32.162 --> 01:20:34.372
They don't care what you do.

01:20:35.123 --> 01:20:37.918
Just as long as you show up
to work and you're okay then.

01:20:38.084 --> 01:20:40.845
Whatever you do on your own time,
that's what you do on your own time.

01:20:41.713 --> 01:20:42.839
(phone ringing)

01:20:43.006 --> 01:20:45.342
Man: Hello, this is
a recorded message

01:20:45.509 --> 01:20:47.677
from your suicide
prevention phone.

01:20:48.136 --> 01:20:50.347
Now first of all why not stop,

01:20:50.555 --> 01:20:53.350
take a deep breath
and think for a minute.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.852
Can things really be all that bad?

01:20:56.603 --> 01:20:59.689
Sure, the road of life can be
pretty bumpy sometimes

01:20:59.856 --> 01:21:04.152
but isn't that just part in parcel
of that rich tapestry we call living?

01:21:04.319 --> 01:21:05.440
- (gunshot)
- (gasp and thud)

01:21:05.529 --> 01:21:07.948
You know, a wise man once said,

01:21:08.114 --> 01:21:10.909
"Today is the first day
of the rest of your life."

01:21:20.252 --> 01:21:22.045
Peter Kleinman: I mean,
you know, I'm not a doctor

01:21:22.212 --> 01:21:24.214
but I guess Doug was an addict.

01:21:24.881 --> 01:21:27.676
He had the disease of addiction,
right?

01:21:28.134 --> 01:21:30.345
Doug couldn't not be high.

01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:34.015
Coming out to L.A.
was very bad for Doug, I think.

01:21:34.182 --> 01:21:37.060
The cocaine out here was
everywhere and, uh...

01:21:38.562 --> 01:21:40.897
Doug just went for it, uh...

01:21:42.107 --> 01:21:45.569
as hard as anybody
has ever gone for it.

01:21:49.489 --> 01:21:53.827
Doug wasn't...
He wasn't as happy

01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:58.707
as I thought I might be
if I had, you know,

01:21:59.249 --> 01:22:01.001
that kind of success

01:22:01.209 --> 01:22:04.254
and that kind of notoriety
and money.

01:22:05.422 --> 01:22:08.300
He was sort of, an emptiness,

01:22:08.925 --> 01:22:10.969
like, there was like a sadness.

01:22:11.595 --> 01:22:12.721
He was having trouble.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.640
And they said, you know,
take him away, or...

01:22:15.807 --> 01:22:17.142
for a week or something.

01:22:17.475 --> 01:22:19.644
So Doug and I went off together.

01:22:19.811 --> 01:22:21.855
I took him to Hawaii.

01:22:22.397 --> 01:22:26.192
I think that he and Chevy were,
at that time, um...

01:22:27.068 --> 01:22:29.154
battling their
attraction to drugs.

01:22:29.571 --> 01:22:32.657
I remember at one point
we were at the hotel

01:22:32.824 --> 01:22:35.285
on Maui on like the 15th floor.

01:22:37.454 --> 01:22:38.956
I went to his room,
and I told him

01:22:39.122 --> 01:22:42.417
I just couldn't take it anymore,
I was so depressed.

01:22:44.294 --> 01:22:46.796
Then I went back to my room
and I took my boots off

01:22:46.963 --> 01:22:51.551
and left them right by the fence,
the terrace,

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.304
and then just went,
"I got, uh, ah!"

01:22:55.388 --> 01:22:59.976
The sound of somebody falling
from the terrace or jumping.

01:23:00.518 --> 01:23:02.646
And he came running and,
of course, I'm hiding

01:23:03.730 --> 01:23:06.024
and for a second he really
actually looked.

01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:08.526
(chuckling)

01:23:14.783 --> 01:23:16.326
I'm telling you
all this about Doug

01:23:16.493 --> 01:23:18.870
because I miss him very much,
he was my best friend.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.795
I had to come back
to work finally,

01:23:28.004 --> 01:23:30.382
back to California,
and I left him in Hawaii.

01:23:30.882 --> 01:23:36.679
I got a call
from Doug's girlfriend, um...

01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:37.847
(clearing throat)

01:23:38.056 --> 01:23:40.809
And he was missing and did
I know where he was

01:23:40.975 --> 01:23:42.227
and I had no idea.

01:23:42.394 --> 01:23:45.271
One day I was talking to him
and the next day he was missing.

01:23:50.235 --> 01:23:53.738
Doug being missing
wasn't that unusual

01:23:53.905 --> 01:23:56.116
but this time
it didn't feel right.

01:23:56.658 --> 01:23:58.076
I flew back out.

01:23:58.243 --> 01:23:59.994
We found Doug but he was
at the bottom of

01:24:00.787 --> 01:24:03.456
what they call
the Grand Canyon in Kauai.

01:24:20.765 --> 01:24:22.267
John Weidman: I don't
want to suggest for a minute

01:24:22.434 --> 01:24:24.310
that what happened
to Doug was expected.

01:24:24.477 --> 01:24:26.104
It was awful
when I got the news,

01:24:26.271 --> 01:24:32.986
but it was not entirely incompatible
with the life he had been living.

01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:38.199
It was a tragic loss.
He was the first person I knew

01:24:38.366 --> 01:24:39.909
that I considered a drug casualty.

01:24:40.618 --> 01:24:42.871
John Landis: Was he stoned
and fell off the cliff?

01:24:43.204 --> 01:24:46.416
Was he suicidal
and jumped off the cliff?

01:24:46.833 --> 01:24:48.835
Or was he in fact murdered
in a drug deal,

01:24:49.002 --> 01:24:50.442
which is what a lot of people think.

01:24:50.754 --> 01:24:53.381
They said that there was a sign
at the cliff where he died,

01:24:53.548 --> 01:24:55.149
that said,
"Do not go beyond this point."

01:24:55.258 --> 01:24:59.304
And as soon as I heard that
I just saw Doug read it and say

01:24:59.471 --> 01:25:00.597
"You mean here?"

01:25:04.642 --> 01:25:06.478
He wrote me a chatty letter
from Hawaii,

01:25:06.644 --> 01:25:09.125
and told me he looked forward to
seeing me when he came to L.A.

01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:10.591
He wanted to talk about something.

01:25:11.316 --> 01:25:12.943
Sol don't think he was...

01:25:13.777 --> 01:25:15.153
I don't think he killed himself.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.406
He was never a guy
to take his life.

01:25:19.073 --> 01:25:24.078
And having thought about it
all this time over the years,

01:25:24.746 --> 01:25:27.374
I think that he...
he slipped.

01:25:27.791 --> 01:25:29.042
Which is stupid.

01:25:29.959 --> 01:25:35.507
And, um... uh, it killed him.
So... that was that.

01:25:39.093 --> 01:25:42.514
I've heard every version
of this and I have no idea.

01:25:43.473 --> 01:25:46.059
Chris Miller very brilliantly said,

01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:50.355
"Doug was looking for a better place
to jump from when he slipped."

01:25:51.397 --> 01:25:54.651
(laughing)

01:26:11.292 --> 01:26:12.418
Henry Beard: Had he lived,

01:26:12.627 --> 01:26:14.963
Doug Kenney would have
been kind of force

01:26:15.129 --> 01:26:17.048
in American movie making,
directorial force

01:26:17.215 --> 01:26:19.676
that John Hughes was,
the kind of movies he made.

01:26:19.843 --> 01:26:21.261
Dad, whoa!

01:26:21.386 --> 01:26:22.596
[music] Walley World! [music]

01:26:24.597 --> 01:26:27.976
Matty Simmons: John Hughes wrote
the short story Vacation '58.

01:26:28.268 --> 01:26:29.388
I called him in, and I said,

01:26:29.394 --> 01:26:31.020
"John, I'm gonna make
a movie of this."

01:26:31.437 --> 01:26:32.564
(tires screeching)

01:26:34.607 --> 01:26:36.400
I think you're
all fucked in the head.

01:26:36.943 --> 01:26:39.821
We're ten hours from the fucking
fun park and you wanna bail out!

01:26:39.988 --> 01:26:42.699
Judd Apatow: Vacation was my family.
I went on those trips,

01:26:42.866 --> 01:26:46.452
and it was that heinous,
you know, every single time.

01:26:46.619 --> 01:26:48.460
Chevy: We're all gonna have
so much fucking fun

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:51.207
we'll need plastic surgery
to remove our goddamn smiles.

01:26:51.666 --> 01:26:54.544
You'll be whistling Zip-a-Dee-
Doo-Dah out of your assholes!

01:26:55.503 --> 01:26:56.504
(laughing)

01:26:56.671 --> 01:26:58.172
It was rated R!

01:26:58.423 --> 01:27:01.551
Dogs are being killed,
adultery is being flaunted.

01:27:01.801 --> 01:27:06.514
There's elderly abuse, incest,
masturbation, kidnapping.

01:27:06.723 --> 01:27:09.309
That's a lot of stuff that
you wouldn't think of as

01:27:09.475 --> 01:27:14.564
being present in what has become
like a beloved family film.

01:27:15.607 --> 01:27:18.151
- Good talk, son.
- Good talk, Dad.

01:27:18.818 --> 01:27:21.696
I think Matty said something like,
"Well, this is National Lampoon."

01:27:25.116 --> 01:27:26.993
Peter Kleinman:
If there was a golden age,

01:27:27.243 --> 01:27:29.954
and a silver age,
and a platinum age,

01:27:30.371 --> 01:27:33.416
this would probably be
the moldy rye bread age

01:27:33.625 --> 01:27:35.001
of the National Lampoon.

01:27:38.379 --> 01:27:41.007
We were doing this horror
and fantasy issue

01:27:41.174 --> 01:27:43.384
and we were trying to come up
with the most horrible,

01:27:43.551 --> 01:27:45.011
gruesome, funny ideas.

01:27:45.345 --> 01:27:48.348
And I said, "What about
a baby in a blender?"

01:27:48.514 --> 01:27:51.392
And everybody was like, "Aah,
that's so funny, baby in a blender!"

01:27:54.646 --> 01:27:58.608
There was supposed to be
a satire of a famous old saying

01:27:58.775 --> 01:28:00.860
that went something like,

01:28:01.027 --> 01:28:03.112
"It's a worse mess
than a baby in a blender."

01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:05.448
So, we decided we would do it.

01:28:05.615 --> 01:28:09.702
And I took a picture of a baby crying
and took a picture of a blender

01:28:09.869 --> 01:28:11.704
and we actually
stripped them together

01:28:11.788 --> 01:28:13.831
so it looked like the baby
was in the blender.

01:28:13.998 --> 01:28:17.627
And we put Satan's finger
on the puree button.

01:28:21.881 --> 01:28:23.675
Matty Simmons: There was a group
called the Christian Coalition

01:28:23.758 --> 01:28:25.843
which hated us because
we made fun of groups

01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:27.470
like the Christian Coalition.

01:28:29.639 --> 01:28:32.850
They organized a group
of right wing zealots

01:28:33.017 --> 01:28:34.137
and they sent letters around

01:28:34.185 --> 01:28:36.813
and we lost almost
all our national advertising.

01:28:42.652 --> 01:28:46.614
And it went downhill from there,
and I'm gonna end it on that note.

01:28:54.455 --> 01:28:56.541
[music] (David Bowie
"Changes" plays) [music]

01:29:12.432 --> 01:29:14.392
The things that happened to us
when we are young

01:29:14.559 --> 01:29:17.270
just seem so much more important
than other things

01:29:17.437 --> 01:29:19.197
because they're happening
for the first time.

01:29:19.689 --> 01:29:21.249
Anne Beatts:
You know, looking backwards

01:29:21.274 --> 01:29:22.942
is always a dangerous position.

01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:24.861
You could really
throw your neck out,

01:29:25.028 --> 01:29:26.904
but when I do look back
at all of this,

01:29:27.113 --> 01:29:28.156
I feel lucky.

01:29:29.365 --> 01:29:31.075
Ivan Reitman: The National Lampoon
really changed my life.

01:29:31.242 --> 01:29:33.745
It introduced me to this
extraordinary group of performers

01:29:33.911 --> 01:29:37.707
that were really the finest
comedic actors of their generation.

01:29:40.668 --> 01:29:42.795
Tony Hendra: Some people might think
this is an egregious comparison,

01:29:42.962 --> 01:29:46.758
but I would say that
my years at the Lampoon, um,

01:29:47.091 --> 01:29:49.594
were not unlike the Paris
of the twenties

01:29:49.844 --> 01:29:52.388
that Hemingway describes
in A Moveable Feast.

01:29:52.638 --> 01:29:56.434
Wherever two or more
Lampoon people got together

01:29:56.601 --> 01:29:59.312
in those years,
something explosive happened.

01:30:03.858 --> 01:30:06.861
Janis Hirsch: I felt like I
snuck in some magical clubhouse.

01:30:07.487 --> 01:30:09.572
With those people there,
you knew you were never

01:30:09.697 --> 01:30:11.098
going to see people
like that again.

01:30:13.242 --> 01:30:14.577
Sean Kelly:
At the end of the year

01:30:14.744 --> 01:30:16.904
when I'm talking to students
who are about to graduate,

01:30:17.038 --> 01:30:21.543
I say I wish them,
that they get maybe five years

01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:23.377
in their whole working lives

01:30:24.253 --> 01:30:25.797
like the five years I got,

01:30:25.963 --> 01:30:29.300
where you're doing something,
frankly, you would pay to do,

01:30:29.884 --> 01:30:31.511
except you're getting
paid to do it.

01:30:37.391 --> 01:30:38.851
Henry Beard:
It's a time of dial telephone.

01:30:39.018 --> 01:30:40.853
There's no Internet,
there's no computers.

01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:43.064
There wasn't that much
that was shared,

01:30:43.356 --> 01:30:45.650
but what was shared
was shared by everybody.

01:30:45.817 --> 01:30:48.194
They absolutely
had everything in common

01:30:48.402 --> 01:30:50.446
and in a way that never
will happen again.

01:30:50.822 --> 01:30:52.302
Michael Gross:
I'm just so super proud

01:30:52.406 --> 01:30:55.535
of that period of our life,
not to mention blessed.

01:30:56.577 --> 01:31:01.123
I somehow was part of
the greatest band of an era.

01:31:06.671 --> 01:31:09.382
Really what is important,
I think, is just those people.

01:31:11.884 --> 01:31:14.679
They became
all of modern comedy.

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.265
[music] (music continues) [music]

01:31:50.506 --> 01:31:53.759
Doug always had a predilection
for sticking his dick in girls' ears.

01:31:54.135 --> 01:31:57.471
Uh, it was something that
he would surprise everybody

01:31:57.638 --> 01:32:00.391
by doing in the middle of
a cocktail party or something.

01:32:00.558 --> 01:32:03.311
There would be Doug with
his dick in some girl's ear.

01:32:03.644 --> 01:32:07.773
And he used to say to me,
"Chris, I hope that somehow"

01:32:08.024 --> 01:32:11.235
"I'll go to heaven and I'll be
able to stick my dick"

01:32:11.402 --> 01:32:13.029
"in the ear
of Eleanor Roosevelt."

01:32:13.321 --> 01:32:17.408
And so when Doug died, I figured
he definitely got into heaven

01:32:17.575 --> 01:32:20.244
and probably,
probably even right now,

01:32:20.411 --> 01:32:22.830
he's sticking his dick
in the ear of Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:32:24.874 --> 01:32:28.711
[music] (Lindsay Buckingham

01:34:29.248 --> 01:34:31.125
(dog barking to beat)

01:34:33.419 --> 01:34:35.880
(indistinct chatter)

01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:39.550
(squeaking)
