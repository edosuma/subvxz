WEBVTT

00:02.031 --> 00:04.460
We don't have enough
workers this season as it is.

00:04.481 --> 00:05.630
I don't know why not,

00:05.650 --> 00:07.541
since the borders are so out of control.

00:07.561 --> 00:08.843
We need people...

00:08.863 --> 00:10.711
We need them to work at a price.

00:10.731 --> 00:12.146
Do you speak English?

00:12.166 --> 00:13.214
No.

00:13.234 --> 00:15.316
Quiero ir a Carolina del Norte.

00:15.336 --> 00:17.618
He wants to go to North Carolina.

00:17.638 --> 00:19.420
Me and my brother, we got to go out

00:19.440 --> 00:20.888
and get people to work the fields.

00:20.908 --> 00:22.846
It's hot out. Want a ride?

00:22.867 --> 00:24.959
How 'bout you come work
on the farm, get paid?

00:24.979 --> 00:26.360
You need beer... I got that.

00:26.380 --> 00:28.028
You want other stuff...

00:28.048 --> 00:29.597
Yeah, you got the money?

00:29.617 --> 00:31.498
- It's all good?
- Yes.

00:31.518 --> 00:32.766
How old are you?

00:32.786 --> 00:33.801
18.

00:33.821 --> 00:35.302
Good answer.

00:35.322 --> 00:37.605
Freeze! Get your hands up!

00:37.625 --> 00:38.739
Shae?

00:38.759 --> 00:40.140
My name is Kimara.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.711
If you let me, I'll do
everything I can to help you.

00:46.239 --> 00:48.415
It's all about sex right now.

00:48.435 --> 00:50.718
It's all about sex and drugs.

00:51.758 --> 00:53.487
There was this article in The Observer.

00:53.507 --> 00:56.390
It was all about the heroin
crisis and sex trafficking

00:56.410 --> 00:58.343
and how these kids are
trading their bodies

00:58.364 --> 00:59.393
to support their habits.

00:59.413 --> 01:00.527
Yeah, I read that.

01:00.547 --> 01:03.697
The D.A. read it, and now
it is his mission in life

01:03.717 --> 01:06.433
to rid this county of
drugs and prostitution...

01:06.453 --> 01:09.470
At least, until some
other article gets written.

01:09.490 --> 01:12.406
Now we got this girl... Shae Reese.

01:12.426 --> 01:14.541
I talked to her.

01:14.561 --> 01:16.710
We need her to testify against her pimp.

01:16.730 --> 01:19.535
She... She doesn't want to help.

01:19.556 --> 01:21.148
She just wants to walk.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.384
She knows she's not facing any charges.

01:23.404 --> 01:25.920
Now, this pimp was running other kids.

01:25.940 --> 01:27.154
She's 17.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.023
If we can convict on
trafficking a minor,

01:29.043 --> 01:30.124
that's a Class D felony.

01:30.144 --> 01:33.627
That sticks. That matters.

01:33.647 --> 01:36.363
Look, you know this girl has
been in and out of the system.

01:36.383 --> 01:37.765
God knows how many times.

01:37.785 --> 01:39.242
She's not gonna trust us cops.

01:39.263 --> 01:42.269
She's not gonna trust us prosecutors.

01:42.289 --> 01:45.072
You're not gonna be doing this alone.

01:45.092 --> 01:47.408
We will support you in every way.

01:47.428 --> 01:51.663
But if you could just put any
extra focus on this girl...

01:54.708 --> 01:58.719
Billy Qualls. Your pimp.

01:58.739 --> 02:01.052
I'm not asking you... I'm telling you.

02:01.073 --> 02:02.914
He's under arrest.

02:05.079 --> 02:07.161
Am I in trouble?

02:07.181 --> 02:09.395
You're under the age of consent.

02:09.416 --> 02:11.999
You didn't do anything wrong.
You didn't commit a crime.

02:12.019 --> 02:14.401
Nobody wants to prosecute you.

02:14.421 --> 02:15.735
The prosecutors...

02:15.756 --> 02:18.172
- They just want you to testify against Billy.
- So I can go?

02:18.192 --> 02:19.673
I told them I'm not doing that.

02:19.693 --> 02:21.575
He ran you,

02:21.595 --> 02:22.910
and he ran five other kids.

02:22.930 --> 02:24.478
Get them to do it.

02:24.498 --> 02:27.065
Your testimony means more.

02:28.135 --> 02:29.616
He didn't do nothing to me.

02:29.636 --> 02:31.652
- All Billy did, he gave me someplace to live.
- He sent you out

02:31.672 --> 02:34.221
and made you collect money for sex.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.290
I was bangin' people before I met Billy.

02:36.310 --> 02:39.493
How are you gonna put him in
jail for what I was doing, anyway?

02:39.513 --> 02:42.224
You tell me it felt right...

02:42.245 --> 02:47.134
Going to a motel, going to an apartment,

02:47.154 --> 02:51.472
taking in some man who made you sick,

02:51.492 --> 02:54.742
and then taking the money...

02:54.762 --> 02:57.511
How much did you get a turn, Shae?

02:57.531 --> 03:01.648
$50? $30?

03:01.667 --> 03:06.452
And then taking that money back
to Billy because he said so?

03:06.473 --> 03:10.642
And where was he? Was
he anywhere around?

03:12.146 --> 03:15.195
You tell me that that felt right to you,

03:15.215 --> 03:17.531
and I'll leave you alone.

03:25.859 --> 03:28.909
When's the trial gonna be?

03:28.929 --> 03:34.982
There will be a few hearings,
and the trial itself...

03:35.002 --> 03:38.218
Maybe nine months.

03:38.238 --> 03:39.887
I'm supposed to do what for nine months?

03:39.907 --> 03:42.094
We will get you into a jobs program.

03:42.115 --> 03:43.830
We'll get you into a shelter...

03:43.851 --> 03:46.160
For nine months?

03:49.550 --> 03:52.966
You got no idea when a trial would be.

03:52.986 --> 03:55.369
You just want me to
hang out and be ready

03:55.389 --> 03:58.238
for when you all want me
to speak against Billy.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.074

04:14.208 --> 04:16.490
Iándale! IDespiértate!

04:16.510 --> 04:18.524
ILas vans salen a las cinco en punto!

04:52.346 --> 04:54.027
Hazel pecan finish.

04:54.047 --> 04:57.264
- Six fold-out leaves.
- It's nice.

04:57.284 --> 05:00.200
- Made right here in North Carolina.
- Is it in stock?

05:00.220 --> 05:02.202
It's hand-crafted.

05:02.222 --> 05:03.670
It would take about three months

05:03.690 --> 05:05.405
for a piece that's not on the floor.

05:05.425 --> 05:06.832
- Hello?
- So, really, we're talking

05:06.853 --> 05:08.108
about one-of-a-kind pieces.

05:08.129 --> 05:10.512
- When? Last night?
- They hold their value.

05:10.531 --> 05:11.359
- How many people?
- I can't tell you in

05:11.379 --> 05:12.346
how many families
these become heirlooms.

05:12.366 --> 05:15.449
- Geez. Well, but not on the farm?
- They really do.

05:15.469 --> 05:17.330
Let Laurie Ann handle it.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.686
- Particularly with our dining sets.
- JD, Laurie Ann will call Wilkens.

05:19.706 --> 05:21.688
- Could you, um, just...
- No. Whatever...

05:21.708 --> 05:23.123
- Could you excuse me a moment?
- Whatever you want to do, JD,

05:23.143 --> 05:25.726
that's on you, but you better
talk to Laurie Ann first.

05:25.746 --> 05:28.028
N...

05:28.048 --> 05:30.931
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Nothing...

05:30.951 --> 05:33.367
There was a fire.

05:33.387 --> 05:35.068
- On the farm?
- No.

05:35.088 --> 05:37.037
On, one of the lots
where they house the workers.

05:37.057 --> 05:39.373
- Did... Did anyone get hurt?
- Yeah, some people were killed.

05:39.393 --> 05:41.775
- Who?
- I don't know. Some workers.

05:41.795 --> 05:43.310
Was it... Was it anyone we know?

05:43.330 --> 05:46.113
I... I don't know. It was some workers.

05:46.133 --> 05:48.448
- It wasn't on the farm.
- Do you need to go?

05:48.468 --> 05:49.583
- Do... Do you...
- No.

05:49.603 --> 05:50.984
JD's talking to Laurie Ann.

05:51.004 --> 05:54.454
They'll, they'll handle it.

05:54.474 --> 05:56.290
You okay?

05:56.310 --> 05:59.259
Yeah, just... It's bad timing.

05:59.279 --> 06:02.981
Laurie Ann's got enough crap
to deal with without this.

07:04.143 --> 07:06.059
So, what's the problem?

07:08.515 --> 07:10.163
I don't feel good.

07:10.183 --> 07:13.567
What's that mean?

07:13.587 --> 07:14.901
I don't feel good.

07:14.921 --> 07:16.236
You don't feel good,

07:16.256 --> 07:18.071
or you... you... You
don't feel like working?

07:18.091 --> 07:20.207
- Hey, what's the problem?
- No problem!

07:20.227 --> 07:22.976
You high?

07:22.996 --> 07:24.411
You... You high?

07:24.431 --> 07:26.380
- I'm trying. I...
- You need to get up and get to work.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.048
I just need... It's hard.

07:28.068 --> 07:29.316
Isaac! What's the problem?

07:29.336 --> 07:31.084
- Come on. Get up.
- Hey!

07:31.104 --> 07:32.653
- Get up!
- What's the problem?

07:32.673 --> 07:35.907
No... No problem. Go do something!

07:52.420 --> 07:54.302
There are rules you have to follow.

07:54.323 --> 07:57.408
Disobeying any of the rules
will lead to your expulsion.

07:57.428 --> 07:59.443
First, no drugs.

07:59.463 --> 08:01.112
You're not allowed to take drugs,

08:01.132 --> 08:03.247
and you're not allowed to
have drugs on the property.

08:03.267 --> 08:06.050
There's chapel at 8:00 a.m.

08:06.070 --> 08:08.452
You must attend chapel every morning.

08:08.472 --> 08:09.587
I'm not religious.

08:09.607 --> 08:12.190
Chapel is not about conversion.

08:12.210 --> 08:13.858
It's about fellowship.

08:13.878 --> 08:16.093
You must attend chapel every morning.

08:16.289 --> 08:17.704
There's a work program

08:17.724 --> 08:19.973
for residents who've
graduated from high school.

08:19.993 --> 08:22.576
For those who have not, we
offer mandatory GED courses.

08:22.596 --> 08:24.444
Are you a high-school graduate?

08:24.464 --> 08:26.113
No.

08:26.133 --> 08:29.015
Then you will be expected
to take the classes

08:29.035 --> 08:31.017
and pass your test.

08:31.037 --> 08:32.486
While you're a client,

08:32.506 --> 08:34.788
you may no possess
any electronic devices,

08:34.808 --> 08:36.523
have any unauthorized visitors,

08:36.543 --> 08:39.144
and leave the property without consent.

08:47.654 --> 08:49.936
How many people stay in this room?

08:49.956 --> 08:53.057
Eight beds, eight girls.

08:54.127 --> 08:57.395
When I was with Billy,
there was only six to a room.

09:03.403 --> 09:07.487
You say "slavery," and people
think you're hysterical.

09:07.507 --> 09:10.290
Well, we are not.

09:10.310 --> 09:12.268
In North Carolina alone,

09:12.289 --> 09:17.831
39% of the state's 150,000 farm workers

09:17.851 --> 09:19.232
report being illegally trafficked

09:19.252 --> 09:20.934
or otherwise abused.

09:20.954 --> 09:23.537
So that is physical abuse, sexual abuse,

09:23.557 --> 09:26.206
death threats, and wage theft.

09:26.226 --> 09:28.141
And there's always, you
know, the possibility of,

09:28.161 --> 09:30.477
you know, exposure to farm chemicals,

09:30.497 --> 09:32.479
toxins, pesticides.

09:32.499 --> 09:34.915
There's all that on one side,

09:34.935 --> 09:36.416
and on the other side,

09:36.436 --> 09:39.453
there is an agricultural business

09:39.473 --> 09:43.356
that brings in over $200
billion into the U.S. economy.

09:43.376 --> 09:46.678
So... guess which side has the edge.

09:48.648 --> 09:52.866
Okay, when you're dealing with
workers in sex trafficking,

09:52.886 --> 09:53.997
in manual labor,

09:54.018 --> 09:57.671
in any area where there
is a possibility of abuse,

09:57.691 --> 09:59.788
it's all about seeing the signs.

09:59.809 --> 10:00.725
Nice to see you.

10:00.746 --> 10:02.909
I'll see you guys next
week. Thanks for coming.

10:02.929 --> 10:04.578
Good talk.

10:06.066 --> 10:09.115
Yeah, if there's a good way
to talk about exploitation.

10:09.135 --> 10:10.817
But, you know, I just...

10:10.837 --> 10:13.887
I just try and, like, drive
home the warning signs...

10:13.907 --> 10:18.191
You know, lack of communication,
housing conditions,

10:18.211 --> 10:20.527
you know, the exposure
to the heroin crisis.

10:20.547 --> 10:22.095
You know what I love?

10:22.115 --> 10:25.765
I love that we're supposed
to call it a "crisis."

10:25.785 --> 10:28.435
Like, when it was crack in
the inner cities, it was a...

10:28.455 --> 10:29.569
An epidemic.

10:29.589 --> 10:31.404
Yeah, epidemic, like the black plague.

10:31.424 --> 10:35.008
Now that's in heroin in
the suburbs, it's a crisis.

10:35.028 --> 10:38.345
Just a... Just a bad thing
that happens to good people.

10:38.365 --> 10:42.148
Gosh, Abby. I thought I
was having a tough day.

10:42.168 --> 10:44.651
You... You can be a cynic

10:44.671 --> 10:47.120
and still have a heart of gold.

10:47.140 --> 10:49.322
Honestly, I mean, I don't
think you can do this job

10:49.342 --> 10:50.991
and not be one.

10:51.011 --> 10:54.060
You know, I was with this girl
today that I'm trying to help,

10:54.080 --> 10:57.998
and she says she thinks she's
better off with her pimp.

10:59.953 --> 11:01.073
Well, that's...

11:01.094 --> 11:03.288
That's not the first
time you've heard that.

11:06.893 --> 11:10.977
No. No, it's... It's not, but it's...

11:10.997 --> 11:13.813
You know, you go through
this space early on

11:13.833 --> 11:16.149
that you hear something like that,

11:16.169 --> 11:19.352
and it depresses you, you know?

11:19.372 --> 11:21.521
And then you teach yourself

11:21.541 --> 11:24.891
not to let their perspective
get to you, and...

11:24.911 --> 11:27.694
Then you realize that
the things you hear,

11:27.714 --> 11:31.049
the things these kids say...
It just doesn't quite...

11:34.354 --> 11:38.122
It just doesn't bring the
pain the way it used to.

11:41.928 --> 11:45.412
You feel like you're burning out.

11:45.432 --> 11:48.900
Abby, I feel like...

11:51.271 --> 11:53.386
I feel like I'm on this lifeboat

11:53.406 --> 11:56.690
that only holds 10 people,

11:56.710 --> 11:58.658
and there was a time that I didn't care

11:58.678 --> 12:00.293
that it only held 10 people.

12:00.313 --> 12:02.395
I'd try to get 100 people on that boat.

12:02.415 --> 12:05.465
But now...

12:05.485 --> 12:09.269
I just accept 10 is all I can get.

12:09.289 --> 12:11.838
Maybe 10.

12:11.858 --> 12:15.075
Don't accept it.

12:15.095 --> 12:18.511
Listen.

12:18.531 --> 12:20.814
Keep fighting the fight.

12:20.834 --> 12:23.101
Keep fighting it.

13:07.213 --> 13:11.031
Le estás causando dolor.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.433
- ŸO ni siquiera te importa?
- Luis...

13:13.453 --> 13:15.468
ÿNo te importa lo que estás causando?

13:15.488 --> 13:17.337
De todos modos me voy.

13:17.357 --> 13:20.958
ŸNo te importa cómo la
estás haciendo sentir?

13:24.164 --> 13:26.079
ITeo!

13:26.099 --> 13:27.414
ITeo!

13:35.245 --> 13:38.458
IVamanos! Come on, let's go!

16:29.301 --> 16:30.767
No.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.212
Do you currently use drugs?

17:10.233 --> 17:12.121
Yes.

17:12.140 --> 17:13.085
Do you self-administer

17:13.106 --> 17:15.356
- drugs using needles?
- No.

17:15.376 --> 17:16.925
What drugs do you use?

17:16.944 --> 17:20.361
Weed. Oxy when I can get it.

17:20.381 --> 17:22.763
I drink.

17:22.784 --> 17:24.499
Okay. What do you drink?

17:24.519 --> 17:25.885
Whatever.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.970
When's the last time you used drugs?

17:28.989 --> 17:30.270
Yesterday.

17:30.291 --> 17:31.973
Are you addicted?

17:31.993 --> 17:33.975
I don't know.

17:33.995 --> 17:35.677
Since you last used,
have you experienced

17:35.697 --> 17:37.011
any increased pain sensitivity

17:37.031 --> 17:38.479
or gastrointestinal problems,

17:38.499 --> 17:40.381
such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting?

17:40.401 --> 17:42.350
No.

17:42.371 --> 17:44.700
Okay, do you have any other
health issues or concerns?

17:44.721 --> 17:45.721
No.

17:49.310 --> 17:50.743
Yeah.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.047
I'm pregnant.

17:57.752 --> 17:59.267
How far along are you?

17:59.287 --> 18:02.303
Almost four weeks.

18:02.323 --> 18:04.472
Have you ever been pregnant before?

18:04.492 --> 18:05.773
Yeah.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.060
And how did that pregnancy end?

18:10.365 --> 18:12.131
It ended.

19:12.493 --> 19:15.348
$20, I will tell you about your son.

19:15.369 --> 19:16.978
Quiero dinero. Veinte dólares.

19:16.998 --> 19:19.447
Dile que pruebe que lo conoce primero.

19:19.467 --> 19:22.417
Tell him something about the boy.

19:22.437 --> 19:25.053
He was, 17, 18 years old.

19:25.073 --> 19:26.988
Diecisiete, dieciocho años.

19:27.008 --> 19:28.390
- He worked, not hard.
- Trabajaba, pero no duro.

19:28.410 --> 19:29.923
Kept talking about going to New York.

19:29.944 --> 19:31.312
Hablaba de irse pa Nueva York.

19:31.333 --> 19:32.827
The reason he was here...

19:32.847 --> 19:34.367
He was gonna work his way to New York.

19:36.651 --> 19:39.067
Thought he was gonna own
a restaurant there one day.

19:39.087 --> 19:40.835
Quería ser dueño de un restaurante.

19:40.855 --> 19:41.969
A little kid,

19:41.989 --> 19:43.604
but he had big things in his head.

19:43.624 --> 19:46.258
Era un chiquillo, pero
tenía sueños grandes.

20:00.541 --> 20:03.812
Your boy... he was no good
for working the fields.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.993
Talk a lot.

20:06.013 --> 20:07.395
Tell good stories.

20:07.415 --> 20:08.729
He was funny.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.231
Made people laugh.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.667
But the bosses... They don't like that.

20:12.687 --> 20:14.102
Pero a los jefes no les gustaba eso.

20:14.122 --> 20:16.370
Bosses only want people to work.

20:16.390 --> 20:18.039
Quieren que la gente trabaje.

20:18.059 --> 20:20.141
- ŸQué le pasó?
- What happened?

20:20.161 --> 20:22.944
One day, the bosses come around,

20:22.964 --> 20:25.428
hear him telling his
stories one too many times.

20:25.449 --> 20:28.609
Los jefes se cansaron de
escuchar sus historias...

20:32.461 --> 20:34.789
He says his son was a big talker.

20:34.809 --> 20:36.457
Not just talk.

20:36.477 --> 20:40.361
The bosses got in your boy's
face... he don't back down.

20:40.381 --> 20:42.063
Los jefes lo querían
ponerlo en su lugar,

20:42.083 --> 20:43.464
pero él no se dejó.

20:43.484 --> 20:45.466
ŸFue el que empezó el problema?

20:45.486 --> 20:47.034
Teo started trouble?

20:47.054 --> 20:49.971
Teo didn't start anything.
He just wouldn't back down.

20:49.992 --> 20:54.040
Told you... He's a boy,
but big in his head.

20:54.061 --> 20:56.577
So the bosses, they don't want that.

20:56.597 --> 20:58.746
Your son was lucky.

20:58.766 --> 21:02.482
I see the bosses, they get mad.

21:02.503 --> 21:04.252
Bad things.

21:04.272 --> 21:07.555
This time, all they do...
They tell him to move on.

21:07.575 --> 21:09.241
Pero nomás le ordernaron que se fuera.

21:13.298 --> 21:14.629
No, no.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.765
The bosses, they don't
pay him what they owe him.

21:19.267 --> 21:21.969
He's got no money, so...

21:21.989 --> 21:25.572
A couple of farms around
here, they are desperate.

21:25.593 --> 21:27.575
They hire anybody.

21:27.595 --> 21:29.461
Contratan a quien sea.

21:36.470 --> 21:40.087
People like your boy.
He tells good stories.

21:40.107 --> 21:42.020
He's here somewhere.

21:42.041 --> 21:43.724
He'll be easy to find.

21:43.744 --> 21:45.511
Va ser fácil de hallarlo.

22:15.009 --> 22:16.257
Hey!

22:16.277 --> 22:18.477
Hey!

22:32.058 --> 22:33.691
Hey.

22:58.486 --> 23:00.368
What are you going to do?

23:00.388 --> 23:02.670
Are you gonna have me arrested

23:02.690 --> 23:05.706
because you hire
undocumented workers?

23:05.726 --> 23:07.475
Are you gonna tell the police

23:07.495 --> 23:09.910
that you don't pay people what you owe?

23:09.930 --> 23:13.614
That you have us living
20 people in a box,

23:13.634 --> 23:16.984
como animales?

23:17.004 --> 23:18.819
Yeah.

23:18.839 --> 23:20.515
So tell them all that.

23:20.536 --> 23:21.886
Go ahead.

23:24.945 --> 23:27.094
Call them.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.782
Call the police.

23:47.452 --> 23:49.278
No, you can't be like that with them.

23:49.299 --> 23:50.333
You know what I'm saying?

23:50.354 --> 23:54.272
These trabajadores... They work for you.

23:58.196 --> 24:00.611
You got to work them.

24:00.631 --> 24:02.798
I work 'em.

24:03.935 --> 24:05.616
I seen you going soft

24:05.636 --> 24:07.985
for that fool you brought to the farm.

24:08.005 --> 24:09.353
He's sick.

24:09.373 --> 24:12.374
Of what?

24:16.214 --> 24:18.763
Oxy fever.

24:18.783 --> 24:21.632
White Trash-itis.

24:21.652 --> 24:23.167
Mira...

24:23.187 --> 24:25.403
They ain't your girlfriend.

24:25.423 --> 24:28.272
They ain't your dog.

24:28.292 --> 24:31.427
You ain't got to do
nothing but make them work.

24:33.331 --> 24:36.247
And that stringy white bitch
ain't nothing but a junkie,

24:36.267 --> 24:38.501
and you are out here going soft for him.

24:41.372 --> 24:43.272
I'm not soft.

24:49.981 --> 24:51.929
Listen to me, okay?

24:51.949 --> 24:54.999
I don't care, people...

24:55.019 --> 25:00.004
Mexican, black, white...

25:00.024 --> 25:02.291
They got to carry their own weight.

25:04.028 --> 25:06.210
Yeah.

25:06.230 --> 25:11.048
You and me... we worked our
asses off in those fields.

25:11.068 --> 25:12.984
You remember?

25:15.273 --> 25:17.221
Now these bosses... They don't care

25:17.241 --> 25:19.957
which kind of fool does the picking.

25:19.977 --> 25:22.411
That's just disrespectful.

25:25.750 --> 25:28.099
If they ain't gonna respect us,

25:28.119 --> 25:30.635
then you got to respect yourself.

25:30.655 --> 25:34.172
And I'm telling you...

25:34.192 --> 25:36.440
you playing around with this white bitch

25:36.460 --> 25:38.609
is not how it gets done.

25:50.942 --> 25:53.291
Hey.

25:53.311 --> 25:54.944
Hey.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.392
You got to get it together, you know?

26:02.453 --> 26:05.203
Yeah?

26:05.223 --> 26:06.871
Yeah.

26:06.891 --> 26:11.342
You... You lit up all... All day.

26:11.362 --> 26:13.444
I wasn't high.

26:13.464 --> 26:15.980
I mean, you're puking
all over the place.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.583
I wasn't high. I...

26:18.603 --> 26:21.352
I'm just trying to get through the day.

26:21.372 --> 26:24.055
Everybody else out there working,

26:24.075 --> 26:26.390
and you're lying in the dirt.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.659
I'm the one that brought you in.

26:28.679 --> 26:30.027
You're gonna make me look bad.

26:30.047 --> 26:32.982
I'm not trying to make you look bad.

26:35.286 --> 26:37.052
Look, I...

26:39.490 --> 26:41.038
I know...

26:41.058 --> 26:43.040
I know I'm not cutting it. I know.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.843
So, I'm... I'm telling you.

26:45.863 --> 26:48.546
I'm trying to get on it 'cause I...

26:48.566 --> 26:51.282
I feel good about
being here and working.

26:51.302 --> 26:53.584
I do. Serious.

26:53.604 --> 26:56.220
I don't... I don't want to
be sitting around all day,

26:56.240 --> 26:57.588
messed up.

26:57.608 --> 26:59.357
I don't want to hang out
with those kind of people.

26:59.377 --> 27:02.693
They... They can't get
their... together, you know?

27:02.713 --> 27:05.529
I don't...

27:05.549 --> 27:08.766
I don't want to be like that.

27:08.786 --> 27:11.053
I...

27:12.757 --> 27:14.872
I texted my brother.

27:14.892 --> 27:18.376
I told him I was working,
told him I-I got a job.

27:18.396 --> 27:20.329
He...

27:21.799 --> 27:23.681
He just thought I was
trying to hit him up,

27:23.701 --> 27:28.619
but I told him, "I
don't need any money."

27:28.639 --> 27:32.456
I told him I was making money.

27:32.476 --> 27:36.460
But he... He didn't...

27:36.480 --> 27:38.663
Anyway, he...

27:38.683 --> 27:42.551
I told him I didn't need money.

28:59.663 --> 29:02.012
- What's up, Aunty?
- Jason, are you serious?

29:02.032 --> 29:03.961
- You are not taller than me.
- I guess.

29:03.982 --> 29:05.867
It freaks me out every time I say it...

29:05.888 --> 29:08.037
Jason's going on his college tour.

29:08.058 --> 29:09.478
You know, two more years, and that's it.

29:09.498 --> 29:10.654
Yeah? Where's he looking?

29:10.674 --> 29:12.289
Well, right now, he keeps talking about

29:12.309 --> 29:13.424
wanting to go to Duke,

29:13.444 --> 29:14.959
but he doesn't have Duke grades.

29:14.979 --> 29:16.660
He's looking into UNC.

29:16.680 --> 29:19.463
Denise wants him to look at Syracuse.

29:19.483 --> 29:21.132
Listen, try and talk her out of it.

29:21.152 --> 29:24.468
Hey, I am not getting
into any domestic disputes.

29:26.991 --> 29:30.374
So, um, can I throw something at you?

29:30.394 --> 29:32.843
Yeah.

29:32.863 --> 29:34.245
It's kind of personal.

29:34.265 --> 29:35.764
Okay.

29:37.268 --> 29:38.883
Um...

29:38.903 --> 29:42.871
I've been trying, and I mean trying...

29:45.829 --> 29:50.461
I've been getting IVF treatments,

29:50.481 --> 29:53.097
and they haven't taken.

29:53.117 --> 29:57.101
And it's rough because
I really want a family,

29:57.121 --> 29:59.570
but these treatments, they're no joke.

29:59.590 --> 30:02.072
- They're expensive.
- Expensive like...

30:02.092 --> 30:05.810
Like $12,000 a cycle. Plus medications.

30:05.830 --> 30:07.378
Damn. Yeah.

30:07.398 --> 30:10.681
And I've already had two cycles.

30:10.701 --> 30:12.468
You need money?

30:13.871 --> 30:16.120
What I need...

30:18.542 --> 30:21.892
Having a baby like this...

30:21.912 --> 30:24.395
The doctor talks about the science

30:24.415 --> 30:27.765
and... and everything's an "adjustment"

30:27.785 --> 30:29.700
or an "enhancement,"

30:29.720 --> 30:32.303
and, "Just move on to the next office",

30:32.323 --> 30:34.405
and we'll help you
fill out the paperwork."

30:34.425 --> 30:37.007
And...

30:37.027 --> 30:39.677
The rooms are cold.

30:39.697 --> 30:43.098
The sperm donor's anonymous.

30:46.604 --> 30:51.388
It's just lonely trying
to have a baby like this.

30:51.408 --> 30:55.777
Shouldn't be this lonely
trying to have a family.

30:57.915 --> 31:01.031
But if this is gonna happen,

31:01.051 --> 31:03.000
I don't want the donor

31:03.020 --> 31:08.005
to be some number on a form.

31:08.025 --> 31:11.126
I want it to be somebody I know.

31:13.130 --> 31:15.130
I want it to be a good man.

31:22.806 --> 31:25.923
That was a compliment.

31:25.943 --> 31:28.592
That's a compliment. That's...

31:28.612 --> 31:31.228
You know, um...

31:31.248 --> 31:32.663
There was a time...

31:32.683 --> 31:35.900
Yeah. There was a time.

31:35.920 --> 31:41.038
What, 20-whatever years ago?

31:41.058 --> 31:44.008
Look, if I had to keep it real,

31:44.028 --> 31:48.078
I still sometimes think about...

31:48.098 --> 31:51.649
Jason could have been ours.

31:51.669 --> 31:54.403
And when you think about that...?

31:55.706 --> 31:58.222
When I think about it...

31:58.242 --> 32:00.976
It could have been pretty good.

32:08.886 --> 32:12.703
I got to...

32:12.723 --> 32:14.104
Yeah, I know. I-I know.

32:14.124 --> 32:16.440
You need to... You
need to think about it.

32:16.460 --> 32:18.609
I've got to talk to Denise.

32:18.629 --> 32:20.110
I mean, that was part
of the plan, right?

32:20.130 --> 32:22.246
I actually talk about this with my wife?

32:22.266 --> 32:25.500
That was part of the plan.

32:28.606 --> 32:32.107
You really want a kid that bad?

32:39.742 --> 32:42.124
Yeah.

32:42.152 --> 32:46.737
I really want a kid that bad.

33:00.237 --> 33:01.970
Let me...

33:04.808 --> 33:07.691
Give me a couple of days.

33:40.714 --> 33:42.362
Thank you.

33:46.520 --> 33:50.404
I'm so glad... You
have grown up so much.

34:01.268 --> 34:02.749
Do you remember Ben Whitlock?

34:02.769 --> 34:04.518
I can tell by that look she doesn't.

34:04.538 --> 34:07.554
That's not true. Ben.
And your wife, Marcy.

34:07.574 --> 34:10.791
Now, see, if I had a memory
like that, I'd be in politics.

34:12.279 --> 34:14.161
She's got enough work
making me sound smart.

34:14.181 --> 34:15.728
No.

34:39.539 --> 34:41.455
- You doing okay?
- Doing good.

34:41.475 --> 34:42.989
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:43.009 --> 34:44.891
That's okay.

34:44.911 --> 34:46.560
I got it. I got it. I got it. No, no.

34:46.580 --> 34:48.128
- It's all right.
- Let me get it. Don't do that.

34:48.148 --> 34:49.329
- Here.
- Get... Jeanette, stop it!

34:49.349 --> 34:50.697
My.

34:50.717 --> 34:54.935
I'm... I-I-I don't like
people running around after me.

34:54.955 --> 34:56.937
You know that. Never did.

34:58.158 --> 35:00.607
Tammy didn't come tonight?

35:00.627 --> 35:05.145
Doesn't like my mood lately.

35:05.165 --> 35:07.647
What were you and
Laurie Ann talking about?

35:07.667 --> 35:10.717
She didn't seem happy.

35:10.737 --> 35:12.052
I know.

35:12.072 --> 35:14.654
I know. That's not my business.

35:14.674 --> 35:16.990
[Music continues

35:17.010 --> 35:20.260
Carson said there was a fire.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.113
Yeah.

35:24.050 --> 35:27.167
Is everything okay?

35:27.187 --> 35:29.669
Some people got killed.

35:29.689 --> 35:32.806
15.

35:32.826 --> 35:35.560
I'm sorry.

35:46.807 --> 35:48.121
I'm gonna get an Uber.

35:48.141 --> 35:50.508
You staying?

35:53.113 --> 35:54.761
Yeah, I guess we are.

35:54.781 --> 35:56.429
I'm... I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

35:56.449 --> 35:58.098
I'm just gonna get an Uber.

36:06.660 --> 36:11.111
Well, we're gonna take
care of that. Tuesday.

36:11.131 --> 36:12.913
- All right, I look forward to that.
- Thank you.

36:12.933 --> 36:14.648
I-I just... I want to
say goodbye to Laurie Ann.

36:14.668 --> 36:15.882
- Thank you.
- Good night.

36:15.902 --> 36:17.117
- What?
- Just... Just...

36:17.137 --> 36:18.919
Laurie Ann, I want to
thank you for having us.

36:18.939 --> 36:21.288
- Well, of course.
- It was really nice tonight.

36:21.308 --> 36:22.756
- Really nice.
- Good. Good.

36:22.776 --> 36:25.759
Is everything okay?

36:25.779 --> 36:27.460
Thank you. Yeah.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.729
- You sure?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

36:29.749 --> 36:33.767
Y'all keep saying that, but...

36:33.787 --> 36:35.535
Carson's been on pins, and...

36:35.555 --> 36:38.438
- Well, he shouldn't be.
- JD's beside himself.

36:38.458 --> 36:40.106
Well, with Daddy how he is,

36:40.126 --> 36:42.442
things just been
hitting JD harder lately.

36:42.462 --> 36:44.311
Jeanette, will just come on?

36:44.331 --> 36:47.747
What... What happened with this fire?

36:47.767 --> 36:50.483
Is it something we need
do something about, or...?

36:50.503 --> 36:52.819
I think that we all feel badly.

36:52.839 --> 36:55.055
Yeah, but I-is... Is there anything

36:55.075 --> 36:56.156
we should for anyone

36:56.176 --> 36:57.891
or anything I-I should do?

36:57.911 --> 37:00.026
Well, people, unfortunately...

37:00.046 --> 37:03.163
Sometimes people confuse
doing something good

37:03.183 --> 37:07.133
with having done something wrong.

37:07.153 --> 37:09.636
These folks have our prayers.

37:09.656 --> 37:12.339
And Lord knows you've been
around the farm long enough

37:12.359 --> 37:14.541
to know that they're strong.

37:14.561 --> 37:17.410
Night, Jeanette.

37:17.430 --> 37:20.380
Carson, you get home safe, okay?

37:53.667 --> 37:55.515
There's hardly anything online.

37:55.535 --> 37:57.484
There's almost nothing at all.

37:57.504 --> 37:59.175
Yeah, but what do you want them to say?

37:59.196 --> 38:00.387
People died.

38:00.407 --> 38:02.589
You know, the news... All it is,

38:02.609 --> 38:04.291
is... It's bad things happening.

38:04.311 --> 38:06.359
It's... They're...
They're not gonna write up

38:06.379 --> 38:07.761
every little thing.

38:07.781 --> 38:09.763
15 people.

38:09.783 --> 38:11.498
It's like that, plane crash.

38:11.518 --> 38:12.632
Doesn't seem like a little
thing. Two weeks ago.

38:12.652 --> 38:14.000
Four people died.

38:14.020 --> 38:15.235
And as upset as you all are...

38:15.255 --> 38:16.736
I didn't hear anything about it until...

38:16.756 --> 38:18.939
I'm just worried about you and JD.

38:18.959 --> 38:21.474
Well, why are you... It's
like you're morbid about this.

38:21.494 --> 38:22.842
No, it concerns you.

38:22.862 --> 38:25.679
It concerns... thank you,
honey... your workers.

38:25.699 --> 38:28.448
Come on. It wasn't...
They weren't on the farm.

38:28.468 --> 38:29.649
So you don't care?

38:29.669 --> 38:32.686
Geez. You are talking in circles.

38:32.706 --> 38:34.421
Yeah, I care.

38:34.441 --> 38:36.690
I care. I just... I don't...

38:36.710 --> 38:38.725
What... I... What am I
supposed to do about it?

38:38.745 --> 38:41.061
JD was upset.

38:41.081 --> 38:42.562
JD was drunk.

38:42.582 --> 38:45.498
- Well, why was he drinking?
- Because JD is a drunk.

38:45.518 --> 38:47.267
No, why did he have to get
himself drunk at the barbecue?

38:47.287 --> 38:48.601
His own wife didn't want to be with him.

38:48.621 --> 38:50.103
Gosh, you know, you really...

38:50.123 --> 38:52.323
You need to go some... spend
some time with your sister.

38:53.927 --> 38:56.476
What?

38:56.496 --> 38:59.212
Well, ever since you...
You went and saw her,

38:59.232 --> 39:00.880
you've been, like... I don't know.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.883
You've been like you
need to work something out

39:03.903 --> 39:06.920
or... or... or
something's eating on you.

39:06.940 --> 39:08.621
Don't do that to me.

39:08.641 --> 39:11.791
Well, the only thing that's changed much

39:11.811 --> 39:13.326
in the last couple of weeks

39:13.346 --> 39:15.462
is you started seeing Raelyn again.

39:15.482 --> 39:16.796
And you need to...

39:16.816 --> 39:19.199
Whatever you feel about your sister,

39:19.219 --> 39:21.134
you need to deal with that.

39:21.154 --> 39:23.737
Well, I don't need you telling me

39:23.757 --> 39:25.405
how I should feel about my sister.

39:25.425 --> 39:28.108
Yeah, but you figure
you're gonna tell us

39:28.128 --> 39:31.095
what we should feel about
some people we don't even know!

39:51.184 --> 39:52.365
Okay, I got to go.

39:52.385 --> 39:54.267
Okay. Bye.

39:54.287 --> 39:56.687
- Bye.
- I love you.

40:12.056 --> 40:14.220
The fire started in
the middle of the night.

40:14.240 --> 40:18.892
One of the workers had a...
one of them little fans.

40:18.912 --> 40:21.728
Bad wiring. Shorted out.

40:21.748 --> 40:25.532
The flame jumped some fabric
and burned through the place.

40:25.552 --> 40:28.201
15 people in these trailers?

40:28.221 --> 40:30.136
There was more than 15 people.

40:30.156 --> 40:32.439
Only six of them got out.

40:32.459 --> 40:34.474
There was no other door?

40:34.494 --> 40:37.343
They couldn't get out through a window?

40:37.363 --> 40:40.547
Sometimes the workers nail
chicken wire to the windows

40:40.567 --> 40:43.183
so that no one breaks in
while they're in the fields.

40:43.203 --> 40:46.152
They were trapped inside?

40:46.172 --> 40:49.689
We tell them not to do
it. They don't listen.
