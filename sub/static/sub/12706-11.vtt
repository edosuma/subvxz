WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.137
Let's try again.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.373
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire slayer...

00:05.405 --> 00:08.007
SPIKE:
 I can't bite anything.
 I can't even hit people.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.009
WILLOW:
 How's with you and Riley?

00:10.044 --> 00:11.679
Every time we talk,
I have to lie.

00:11.711 --> 00:13.980
I wish I could just come clean.

00:14.013 --> 00:15.916
Well, you can't.

00:15.948 --> 00:18.852
Yeah, I know I can't.
But Buffy's special.

00:27.394 --> 00:28.995
I guess we have to talk.

00:29.028 --> 00:31.599
I guess we do.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.786
Somebody should speak
before one of us graduates.

01:10.903 --> 01:12.406
What are you?

01:13.840 --> 01:16.176
Capricorn. On the cusp
of Aquarius. You?

01:17.844 --> 01:22.750
Sorry. Came out a little
blunter than I intended.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.784
It's just...

01:24.817 --> 01:27.054
You're amazing--
your speed, your strength...

01:27.087 --> 01:30.022
Also passionate,
artistic and inquisitive.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.826
Who are you?

01:33.860 --> 01:35.962
You know who I am.

01:35.996 --> 01:39.167
The rest-- what I do--

01:39.200 --> 01:41.134
I can't tell you.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.406
Well, then let me.

01:46.439 --> 01:49.942
You're part of some
military monster squad

01:49.977 --> 01:53.347
that captures
demons, vampires.

01:53.381 --> 01:56.150
Probably have some official-
sounding euphemisms for them.

01:56.183 --> 01:58.252
Like... unfriendlies

01:58.286 --> 02:00.353
or non-sapiens.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.121
Hostile subterrestrials.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.823
So, you deliver these...

02:03.856 --> 02:07.093
HSTs to a bunch of lab coats

02:07.126 --> 02:09.027
who perform experiments
on them, which,

02:09.062 --> 02:12.265
among other things, turns some
into harmless little bunnies.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.001
How am I doing so far?

02:14.033 --> 02:15.635
A little too well.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.271
Meanwhile...

02:17.305 --> 02:19.973
by day, you pretend
to be Riley Finn,

02:20.007 --> 02:21.675
corn-fed Iowa boy.

02:23.009 --> 02:25.478
Ever been to
Iowa, Riley?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.215
God, if that's even your name.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.115
It is. Born and raised.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.784
And, hey,
bulletin:

02:31.818 --> 02:34.388
I'm not the only one who's been
a little less than honest here.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.329
I thought a professional
demon chaser like yourself

02:41.361 --> 02:43.396
would have figured
it out by now.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.933
I'm the slayer.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.871
Slayer.

02:50.903 --> 02:52.206
Chosen One.

02:53.706 --> 02:57.344
She who hangs out
a lot in cemeteries?

02:57.377 --> 02:59.379
You're kidding.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.584
Ask around.
Look it up.

03:03.616 --> 03:07.254
Slayer, comma, the.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.122
And you fight demons?

03:10.723 --> 03:12.526
I mean, you whaled
on those guys.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.395
You did pretty well yourself.

03:14.427 --> 03:17.365
Yeah, but I'm
a walking bruise today.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.300
You see me with my clothes off,
I look like a...

03:22.536 --> 03:24.937
I mean, I have bruises...

03:24.972 --> 03:27.206
I don't see a scratch on you.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.942
You're not looking hard enough.

03:28.975 --> 03:30.644
I'm looking pretty hard.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.054
So, then...

03:43.324 --> 03:45.293
what do we do?

03:45.325 --> 03:47.159
I don't know.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.432
I just...

03:52.466 --> 03:54.901
I really thought that

03:54.935 --> 03:56.903
you were a nice, normal guy.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.473
I am a nice, normal guy.
Maybe by this town's standards,

03:59.507 --> 04:01.008
but I'm not grading on a curve.

04:03.843 --> 04:07.448
I think we both need
a little time to...

04:07.480 --> 04:09.483
process everything.

04:11.318 --> 04:14.322
Maybe then...
Yeah.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.689
Yeah, I think
that's a good idea.

04:25.132 --> 04:28.235
Oh. I don't think
I need to tell you...

04:28.268 --> 04:29.235
I won't say a word.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.737
Good.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.673
It'll be safer for all...
(squealing)

04:39.779 --> 04:41.781
(rumbling)

04:43.115 --> 04:44.951
Over here.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.230
Wow.
That was some ride.

05:03.235 --> 05:05.305
Sorry, I'm... so excited.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.307
It's my first
earthquake.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.345
It's not mine.

05:15.915 --> 05:19.286
(wolf howling)

05:19.319 --> 05:21.555
*

06:10.903 --> 06:13.841
My sodding
sleeping chair's bloody...

06:13.874 --> 06:15.341
sodden.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.245
The quake just knocked
a couple of pipes loose.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.379
There's a wrench hanging up
over there by the workbench.

06:20.413 --> 06:21.749
Try tightening the coupling.

06:21.781 --> 06:24.184
I look like a plumber to you?

06:24.216 --> 06:26.019
No, you look like a big mooch
who doesn't lift a finger

06:26.052 --> 06:28.755
around here.
But I have to get to work.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.792
Yeah. Delivering
melted cheese on bread.

06:31.824 --> 06:34.127
Doing your part to keep
America constipated.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.697
Mock not. Remember who pays
for the plasma around here, pal.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.600
You earn your keep,
or you don't get kept.

06:43.269 --> 06:45.038
When you're done
fixing that leak,

06:45.072 --> 06:46.807
try cleaning up this mess.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.776
And doing a little laundry
for once wouldn't kill you.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.911
Unfortunately.

06:59.151 --> 07:02.422
Hey. I was in the library
during the quake.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.125
Almost got buried in some
19th-century literature.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.495
And I don't have to tell you

07:07.528 --> 07:09.396
how hard it is to dig
through some of that stuff.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.564
You okay?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.966
Yeah. Uh, a couple
of broken knickknacks,

07:14.000 --> 07:15.569
but no biggies.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.737
Well, Porter dorm
is completely blacked out,

07:17.771 --> 07:20.106
so naturally they're
dealing with the crisis

07:20.139 --> 07:22.576
the only way they know how:
aftershock party.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.411
Ah, this from the dorm
that brought us

07:24.444 --> 07:26.012
the Somebody Sneezed party

07:26.045 --> 07:27.781
and the Day That
Ends In Y party.

07:27.814 --> 07:30.750
They do seem to be pretty
generous with the milestones.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.952
Hey, you should
ask Riley to come.

07:32.985 --> 07:35.523
Much carousing
by flattering candlelight.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.191
Uh... Riley's, um...

07:38.225 --> 07:39.959
busy, I'm pretty sure.

07:39.992 --> 07:42.161
But, you know, you go on ahead,

07:42.194 --> 07:43.764
and I'll catch up
with you there.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.365
I'm on my way for a little
Giles one-on-one.

07:46.399 --> 07:47.867
Anything wrong?

07:47.901 --> 07:51.204
Wrong? No. Mm-mmm.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.240
Not at all.

07:57.409 --> 07:59.278
Something horrible's
gonna happen, Giles.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.880
It was an earthquake, Buffy.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.315
A not uncommon occurrence
in Southern California.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.451
No reason to think
it was anything more.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.620
Oh, I so have a reason.
A darn good reason.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.524
The last time
we had an earthquake, I died.

08:10.557 --> 08:13.060
Yes, I know that,
and therefore

08:13.093 --> 08:14.528
I completely understand
your anxiety.

08:14.562 --> 08:17.230
Oh, good.
'Cause I'd hate

08:17.264 --> 08:20.668
for my little untimely horrible
death concern to be ambiguous.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.502
But unless evidence
suggests otherwise,

08:22.536 --> 08:25.538
I think we can assume that
it's shifting land masses

08:25.572 --> 08:27.908
and not a portent of
some imminent doom.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.910
Now, in the meantime,

08:29.942 --> 08:33.080
I've got a few theories about
our mysterious commando friends.

08:33.113 --> 08:36.482
Oh. Really?

08:36.515 --> 08:38.250
Yes. Now,
based on

08:38.284 --> 08:39.552
the locations
of our various sightings

08:39.586 --> 08:42.522
and Spike's
reluctant description

08:42.556 --> 08:43.657
of their underground
installation...

08:43.691 --> 08:45.558
What if the quake was a sign--

08:45.592 --> 08:47.427
a bad omen--
and we just ignore it?

08:47.460 --> 08:48.828
There's gonna be
a lot of red faces

08:48.861 --> 08:50.998
when the world comes to an end.
Buffy,

08:51.030 --> 08:53.933
if the quake heralded
some such catastrophe,

08:53.966 --> 08:55.735
then I'm sure there will
be other signs to follow,

08:55.769 --> 08:57.537
which will afford us
plenty of time to avert it.

08:57.571 --> 09:01.508
Now, I believe the
commando installation

09:01.541 --> 09:04.611
is either very close to or
directly underneath your school.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.212
Now, if that is the
case, I'm convinced

09:06.245 --> 09:08.280
that one or more of them
may be in your very midst.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.515
Plague.
What?

09:09.548 --> 09:11.217
What if the end
of the world is coming

09:11.250 --> 09:12.919
in the form of a plague?
Then too many people

09:12.952 --> 09:14.621
may become infected by the time
we actually decide to...

09:14.654 --> 09:17.857
Buffy, will you stop worrying
about what may be

09:17.890 --> 09:19.359
and concentrate on what is?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.561
Vigilance is all
very well and good,

09:21.595 --> 09:23.096
but as I feel
we're getting close,

09:23.129 --> 09:25.365
there is a much more
pressing question.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.734
What's a slayer?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.735
Slayer? A thrash band.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.370
Anvil-heavy guitar rock with
delusions of Black Sabbath.

09:31.403 --> 09:33.373
No. A girl. With powers.

09:33.405 --> 09:34.774
Oh. The slayer.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.644
Oh, yeah. I've heard
of the slayer.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.311
Fill me in.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.048
Well, the way I got it figured,
slayer's like

09:41.081 --> 09:42.783
some kind of bogeyman
for the subterrestrials.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.652
Something they tell
their little spawn to make 'em

09:44.684 --> 09:46.787
eat their vegetables
and clean up their slime pits.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.254
You're telling me
she doesn't exist.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.789
Oh, wait a sec.

09:49.822 --> 09:51.825
Am I bursting
somebody's bubble here?

09:51.859 --> 09:55.962
Maybe this is a bad time to tell
you about the Easter Bunny.

09:55.995 --> 09:57.297
(laughing)

09:57.330 --> 10:00.100
Sorry, sorry.
It's a myth, Ri.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.568
All part of that medieval
folklore garbage

10:02.601 --> 10:03.903
kooks dream up to explain

10:03.937 --> 10:04.772
things we deal with
every day.

10:07.206 --> 10:09.809
How do you explain the things
we deal with, Forrest?

10:09.842 --> 10:13.179
They're just animals, man.
Plain and simple.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.414
Granted, a little rarer than
the ones you grew up with

10:15.447 --> 10:16.482
on that little farm
in Smallville, but...

10:16.515 --> 10:18.284
(thumping)
(growling)

10:18.985 --> 10:21.822
(grunting)

10:21.855 --> 10:23.490
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Attention, all personnel.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.625
Security breach.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.633
Where's that hypo?

10:44.878 --> 10:46.278
Never mind.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.715
(coughs)

10:47.748 --> 10:49.649
Like I said...

10:49.682 --> 10:51.951
animals.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.287
(banging)
What's that racket?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.056
Animals rattling
in their cages.

10:56.088 --> 10:57.657
Doing it all day.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.793
Wonder what's got
'em all worked up?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.128
Earthquakes, man.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.696
They make everybody crazy.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.664
(rock music playing)

11:15.908 --> 11:18.211
* You say you want to
help me out *

11:18.245 --> 11:21.048
* But you just fill my head
with doubt *

11:21.081 --> 11:22.548
* Yeah, I got
my own reality *

11:22.581 --> 11:24.451
* It sure ain't virtual

11:26.854 --> 11:29.522
* It's my highway I choose

11:29.556 --> 11:31.524
* And I control the cruise

11:31.557 --> 11:33.092
(indistinct conversation)

11:38.264 --> 11:40.100
Percy. Hi.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.534
Hey, Willow.
What's going on?

11:42.568 --> 11:44.504
Stuff.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.875
I thought you got that
football scholarship to USC.
I did.

11:47.908 --> 11:48.707
Laurie goes here.

11:48.741 --> 11:49.842
Hey.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.211
Hi.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.547
Some party, huh?

11:54.581 --> 11:56.615
It's okay.

12:02.455 --> 12:03.791
How's Oz?

12:03.823 --> 12:05.158
Oh. Actually, Oz...

12:11.965 --> 12:14.201
Um, listen, we're gonna
go get some drinks.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.735
Uh, cool to see you.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.203
Bye.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.739
Yeah, catch you later.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.783
(whooping)

12:46.765 --> 12:48.969
Hey, you guys serious
about naked limbo?

12:49.001 --> 12:50.336
I'm in.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.868
Buffy, where are you?

13:20.900 --> 13:23.370
LAURIE:
Why, so I can watch you
flirt with that redhead?

13:23.403 --> 13:26.605
PERCY:
What, Rosenberg? Yeah, right.
She's just some egghead

13:26.639 --> 13:28.475
who tutored me a little
in high school.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.811
I mean, she's nice, but come on.
Captain of the nerd squad.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.514
LAURIE:
Well, I don't know. Maybe
you have a thing for geeks.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.649
PERCY:
Uh, no.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.018
I like my women hot.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.852
Call me old-fashioned.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.797
(music, indistinct
conversations continuing)

13:50.830 --> 13:52.899
Hello?

13:52.932 --> 13:55.534
Anyone in here?

14:32.871 --> 14:34.441
Aah!

14:39.046 --> 14:40.679
XANDER:
 Oh, no.

14:40.712 --> 14:42.682
Spike, the place looks
worse than when I left.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.418
You didn't even fix the drip.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.553
SPIKE:
Don't turn around.

14:47.586 --> 14:49.588
Spike, what is it?
What happened?

14:49.621 --> 14:51.423
Don't look at me.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.070
I shrunk them.

15:03.102 --> 15:06.572
Bleeding shirt, trousers.

15:06.605 --> 15:09.076
I hate this place.
You know,
I'm not any happier

15:09.109 --> 15:11.610
about you wearing
my stuff than you are.
Go out.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.812
Get me some decent stuff.
And I want more blood.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.416
No. You're not a guest.

15:16.448 --> 15:19.552
You want me to tear this place
apart, you bloody poof?

15:19.586 --> 15:22.754
That's it. I am way past
through with you.

15:22.788 --> 15:25.091
Hate to break it to you,
o impotent one,

15:25.125 --> 15:26.994
but you're not the
big bad anymore.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.995
You're not even
the kind of naughty.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.898
You're nothing but a waste
of space. My space.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.500
And as much as
I always got a big laugh

15:34.533 --> 15:36.235
watching Buffy
kick your shiny white bum,

15:36.269 --> 15:38.171
and as much as I know
I could give you a little

15:38.205 --> 15:41.240
bum-kicking myself right now,
I'm here to tell you something.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.644
You're not even worth it.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.481
I'm out of here.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.988
(indistinct conversations)

15:57.789 --> 15:59.359
Buffy.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.461
Over here.

16:02.495 --> 16:06.033
Wow. I wasn't sure where
the party was, and...

16:06.066 --> 16:08.000
then I saw the flashing
lights and the ambulance,

16:08.034 --> 16:10.437
and I was, like,
"Right, of course."

16:10.470 --> 16:14.006
Death, carnage...
it's a Buffy party.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.875
I'm so glad you're here.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.809
What happened?

16:17.844 --> 16:21.681
I found him-- this guy
on the bed with me, dead.

16:21.713 --> 16:24.817
Not me dead, he dead.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.852
God. Are you okay?

16:26.885 --> 16:28.721
(whispers):
Vampire?

16:28.754 --> 16:31.158
There was so much blood.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.525
And there-there was a symbol.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.695
And Percy said I was a nerd.

16:35.727 --> 16:37.063
Percy called you a nerd?

16:38.264 --> 16:40.466
I guess we should
report to Giles,

16:40.500 --> 16:42.735
get with the demon-tracking.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.676
Does Percy even go here?

16:52.078 --> 16:55.215
Okay. That's makes
oh for a billion.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.549
You don't got game, son.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.318
What's going on in
that head of yours?

16:59.351 --> 17:02.554
I'm just trying to make up
my mind about something.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.059
Buffy-- she's pretty cool,
isn't she?

17:07.094 --> 17:10.063
Yes, already.
She's cool. She's hot.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.931
She's tepid.
She's all-temperature Buffy.

17:11.963 --> 17:14.031
Now, can we concentrate
on the game here?

17:15.233 --> 17:16.736
(door opens)

17:18.605 --> 17:21.607
Good block. You should
use your face more often.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.742
We have an alpha
code-blue situation.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.077
One of ours?

17:25.112 --> 17:27.046
Negative. Civilian at
the Porter Hall party.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.448
HST attack?

17:28.480 --> 17:30.782
Cannot confirm that. I couldn't
get close

17:30.817 --> 17:32.419
without drawing
attention to myself.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.854
Should we mobilize?

17:34.886 --> 17:37.190
No. I'll go,
do a little recon,

17:37.223 --> 17:38.525
see if it falls
in our domain.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.259
You alert Professor Walsh.

17:40.292 --> 17:42.261
Tell her we have a casualty
of an indeterminate nature.

17:42.295 --> 17:45.064
Let's not make a move
until we get the whole story.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.701
It just made me feel like I was
right back in high school.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.739
Dumb jock. If it wasn't for
you, he still would be.

17:52.771 --> 17:55.074
Yeah. I mean,
I know

17:55.107 --> 17:57.544
the Percy thing
isn't really important.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.078
It's the dead guy on the bed.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.381
Yeah. That's bad, too.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.615
Ooh, and something else:

18:03.650 --> 18:05.785
he-- the dead guy--
was-was propped up,

18:05.817 --> 18:09.388
like whatever killed him wanted
to drain the blood out of him.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.656
So I'm thinking

18:10.690 --> 18:12.159
the whatever

18:12.192 --> 18:15.327
took a bunch
of the guy's blood with him.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.397
And I haven't been a nerd
for a very long time.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.799
Hello-- dating a guitarist.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.336
Or, I was.

18:23.369 --> 18:24.436
Tell them about the symbol.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.138
Right. Um,

18:26.173 --> 18:27.906
it was carved into his chest

18:27.940 --> 18:30.277
like a big, creepy eye.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.444
XANDER:
It's kind of the CBS logo.

18:32.479 --> 18:35.948
Hey, could this be the handiwork
of one Mr. Morley Safer?

18:35.981 --> 18:39.117
I'm telling you, I've
seen this somewhere before.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.988
I just can't remember where.
I mean, it's like...

18:42.020 --> 18:43.655
It's the end of the world.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.159
Again?
Again?

18:46.192 --> 18:49.328
It's, um, the earthquake...
That symbol is, um...

18:49.362 --> 18:52.030
I told you.
I said end of the world.

18:52.064 --> 18:55.167
And you're like, "Pooh-pooh,
Southern California, pooh-pooh."

18:55.201 --> 18:57.369
I'm so very sorry.
My contrition

18:57.403 --> 18:58.770
completely dwarfs
the impending apocalypse.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.141
No, i-it can't be.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.477
We... We've done this already.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.212
GILES:
It's the end of the
world. Everyone dies.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.280
It's rather
important, really.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.615
So what do we do?

19:09.648 --> 19:12.484
I stop it.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.694
I wonder where
I've seen this before.

19:22.729 --> 19:26.232
Where else? The place I spend
most of my waking hours

19:26.266 --> 19:29.368
memorizing stuff
off the sides of mausoleums.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.003
Big, freaky
cereal boxes of death.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.006
(door opens)

19:44.750 --> 19:46.184
Door was open.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.961
(grunting)

20:17.317 --> 20:18.884
(grunting)

20:44.277 --> 20:47.113
Wow, that flippy thing
that you did was...

20:47.145 --> 20:48.980
Where did it go?
It's gone.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.416
I saw it
take off toward the woods.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.419
And you didn't follow it?

20:52.451 --> 20:54.453
No weapons, no backup.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.588
You don't go after a demon
that size by yourself.

20:56.623 --> 20:59.057
I do.

20:59.090 --> 21:01.493
Yeah, well, I'm no slayer.

21:01.528 --> 21:04.931
Base one, this is Lilac one.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.398
Lilac?

21:06.432 --> 21:07.967
MAN: Go.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.669
Confirmed sighting
of an unidentified sub-T.

21:09.701 --> 21:12.771
Mobilize patrol team
for debriefing at 0800 hours.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.205
Copy that.

21:17.042 --> 21:20.112
Very commandery.

21:20.145 --> 21:22.147
Lilac notwithstanding.

21:24.351 --> 21:27.819
What are you doing here?

21:27.854 --> 21:29.087
Looking for you,

21:29.121 --> 21:31.657
She Who Hangs Out in Cemeteries.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.295
Well, I have to...

21:36.328 --> 21:38.197
get the demon.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.999
Don't sweat it.
We'll bag it.

21:40.031 --> 21:43.001
It's not that simple.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.270
Yeah, but...
Look, I really think...

21:45.304 --> 21:48.508
Riley, I just...

21:48.540 --> 21:50.376
I can't.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.177
Can't talk?

21:52.211 --> 21:54.614
Can't any of it.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.282
I can't be with you.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.686
It's a huge black
pit of a mistake,

22:00.720 --> 22:02.489
and I can't go there again.

22:02.521 --> 22:04.691
Again?
You dated me before?

22:04.723 --> 22:07.527
No. Look, I was involved...

22:10.328 --> 22:12.731
You don't know
what my life is like.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.032
And I'm dying to find out.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.902
"Dying" being
the operative word here.

22:15.934 --> 22:18.037
Okay?
There's too much risk.

22:18.069 --> 22:19.538
There's too much...

22:19.571 --> 22:21.907
It's just doomed.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.977
And I can't do doomed
again right now.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.578
I'm sorry.

22:26.613 --> 22:28.414
I don't understand
where this is coming from.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.916
I know you like me.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.551
And it's not like we don't
have anything in common.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.220
But that's not enough.

22:34.252 --> 22:36.888
Buffy,
I'm thrown by this.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.925
I'm confused.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.828
But I can feel my skin humming.

22:42.862 --> 22:46.432
My hands, m...
my every inch of me.

22:46.465 --> 22:49.134
I've never been this excited
about anybody before.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.337
I'm not trying to scare you,

22:52.371 --> 22:53.839
and I'm not gonna
force myself on you,

22:53.873 --> 22:56.342
but I am, by God,
not gonna walk away

22:56.375 --> 22:57.777
because I think
it might not work.

22:57.809 --> 23:01.346
I don't know what's
happened in your past.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.115
Pain.

23:03.148 --> 23:04.851
Death.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.586
Apocalypse.

23:06.618 --> 23:10.256
None of it fun.

23:10.288 --> 23:11.891
Do you know what a Hellmouth is?

23:11.923 --> 23:15.094
Do you have a fancy
term for it?

23:15.126 --> 23:18.464
Because I went to high school
on it for three years.

23:18.498 --> 23:22.769
We do not have
that much in common.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.202
This is a job to you.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.270
It's not just a job.

23:25.304 --> 23:27.038
It's an adventure, great.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.909
But for me, it's destiny.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.278
It is something
that I can't change,

23:32.310 --> 23:33.980
something that I can't
escape. I'm stuck.

23:34.012 --> 23:35.714
You don't have to be.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.317
You're not
in high school anymore.

23:38.349 --> 23:40.118
You can change things.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.121
Riley, no.
Look, I know it may seem...

23:42.153 --> 23:43.388
Riley...

23:43.422 --> 23:46.157
My answer is no.

24:06.679 --> 24:07.846
A Vahrall demon.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.481
Ew.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.450
I second that
revulsion.

24:11.483 --> 24:14.452
Yes. "Slick like gold
and gird in moonlight,

24:14.487 --> 24:18.790
father of portents
and brother to blight."

24:18.825 --> 24:20.660
"Limbs with talons,
eyes like knives;

24:20.692 --> 24:23.762
bane to the blameless,
thief of lives."

24:23.796 --> 24:25.096
Three meters tall,

24:25.131 --> 24:27.465
approximately
100 to 120 kilograms,

24:27.500 --> 24:30.102
based on my visual analysis.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.104
Special hazards?
Unknown.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.140
Probably nothing
we haven't handled before.

24:34.173 --> 24:37.844
There's no pattern
that we can discern yet,

24:37.876 --> 24:40.613
so we got to assume it's on
a basic kill-crush-destroy.

24:40.646 --> 24:43.182
The thing isn't digging up
the bones of a child for fun.

24:43.214 --> 24:46.451
Well, a demon's got some pretty
hilarious ideas about fun.

24:46.484 --> 24:47.987
The bones of a child, though.

24:48.019 --> 24:50.656
I saw that.

24:55.394 --> 24:57.395
An ancient ritual...

24:57.429 --> 25:01.200
It uses the blood of a man,
the bones of a child,

25:01.232 --> 25:04.202
and something called
 The Word of Valios.

25:04.236 --> 25:07.673
It's all part
of a sacrifice...

25:07.707 --> 25:09.375
the sacrifice of three.

25:09.407 --> 25:12.411
Let me guess.
Ends the world.

25:12.443 --> 25:15.815
Well, yeah. It's not big
with the details, though.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.317
It... it doesn't say
how the world ends

25:18.349 --> 25:21.887
or what the ritual
entails exactly.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.222
A sacrifice of three.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.157
Three people are gonna die?

25:26.192 --> 25:28.027
No, they won't.

25:28.059 --> 25:30.730
Because claw boy's not getting
all of his ingredients.

25:30.762 --> 25:32.565
We have to find that third one--
 The Word of Valios.

25:32.598 --> 25:34.032
Keep him from getting it.

25:34.066 --> 25:36.335
WILLOW:
If he doesn't already have it.

25:36.367 --> 25:39.070
I mean, who knows
where he's been?

25:39.105 --> 25:40.439
Here's one for the good guys.
This thing's

25:40.471 --> 25:42.208
got a pheromone signature
a mile wide.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.076
Agent Gates has been working
with the detection system

25:44.109 --> 25:45.510
the lab's developing.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.212
Can't tell where it's going.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.048
But I've got a bead
on where it's been.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.618
Residual traces showing up
in populated areas.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.921
Thing's not shy.
We're going out in civvies--

25:54.953 --> 25:57.288
day clothes only, guys.
Weapons stowed in packs.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.057
Keep 'em out of sight
till nightfall.

25:59.090 --> 26:02.228
Remember, this isn't
a capture, it's a kill.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.630
Pick up quadrant
assignments from me.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.698
We'll blanket
the town.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.866
I'll check the magic shop,
see if they've heard of a book

26:07.900 --> 26:09.434
called The Word of Valios.
Will, Xander,

26:09.468 --> 26:10.869
how about the book archives
at the museum?

26:10.903 --> 26:12.739
We'll stop by my house
on the way, get some weapons,

26:12.771 --> 26:14.941
and I'll change into something
that isn't quite as,

26:14.973 --> 26:17.108
uh, anchovy-scented.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.944
You guys, this thing
takes wicked very seriously.

26:18.978 --> 26:22.080
Be careful. I couldn't stand
anybody getting hurt.

26:22.114 --> 26:25.351
Good-bye, Dru.
See you in hell.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.923
What are you doing?

26:30.957 --> 26:34.626
Bloody rot.
Can't a person knock?

26:34.661 --> 26:36.127
WILLOW:
What are you doing?

26:36.162 --> 26:38.596
You were trying
to stake yourself.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.432
Fag off.

26:40.465 --> 26:42.334
It's no concern of yours.

26:42.367 --> 26:45.070
Is too. For one thing,
that's my shirt

26:45.104 --> 26:46.505
you're about to dust.
And for another,

26:46.538 --> 26:48.074
we've shared
a lot here.

26:48.106 --> 26:50.009
You should have trusted me
enough to do it for you.

26:50.041 --> 26:51.477
Xander.

26:51.509 --> 26:54.113
What? He wants to die.
I want to help.

26:54.145 --> 26:57.348
WILLOW:
It's ooky. We know him. We can't
just let him poof himself.

26:57.383 --> 26:58.951
Oh, but you can.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.618
You know I'd drain you
drier than the Sahara

27:00.653 --> 27:02.922
if I had
half a chance.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.856
And besides,
I'm beyond pathetic.

27:04.891 --> 27:07.326
Stuck in this basement
washing skivvies for a blighter

27:07.358 --> 27:09.295
I wouldn't have bothered
to bite a few months ago.

27:09.327 --> 27:10.528
Hey.

27:10.561 --> 27:11.698
I mean, am I even

27:11.730 --> 27:13.531
remotely scary anymore?

27:13.565 --> 27:15.467
Tell me the truth.

27:19.971 --> 27:22.107
Well, the shirt is kind of

27:22.141 --> 27:24.476
not very threatening,
and the short pants...

27:24.509 --> 27:27.179
But, you know, it could also be
'cause I know you can't bite,

27:27.212 --> 27:29.682
which I guess isn't what you
really need to hear right now.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.951
SPIKE: Stop. Look,
just clear out, okay?
Fine.

27:31.983 --> 27:33.618
But you break anything
else while we're gone,

27:33.652 --> 27:35.721
and you'll be sleeping
in the garage, buster.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.890
We can't leave him
here like this.

27:37.923 --> 27:40.026
We'll have to take him
with us to the museum.

27:40.058 --> 27:41.660
Oh, you go on.

27:41.693 --> 27:43.128
I won't do anything.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.663
I feel better now.
Promise.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.634
Think of the happy.

27:48.666 --> 27:50.301
If we don't find what
we're looking for,

27:50.336 --> 27:51.738
we're facing
an apocalypse.

27:51.770 --> 27:54.205
Really?
You're not just saying that?

28:12.759 --> 28:14.727
Buffy.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.195
Is this really the time
for Donkey Kong?

28:17.229 --> 28:18.297
What?

28:20.598 --> 28:23.102
Oh.

28:23.134 --> 28:25.171
It, uh, takes trace readings

28:25.203 --> 28:27.173
of the creature's pheromones.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.740
And?

28:28.775 --> 28:31.176
And it's either mating season
for this thing,

28:31.210 --> 28:33.612
or it's moving all over town.

28:33.644 --> 28:35.748
You know, Buffy...

28:35.781 --> 28:37.348
Actually, I need to go.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.518
Big bad needs to be squished.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.386
Right. I'm on it, too.

28:41.420 --> 28:45.791
It's just, this thing-- this
you-and-me thing-- it's stupid.

28:45.825 --> 28:49.361
I know. Which is why
we can't do it,

28:49.394 --> 28:51.563
the you-and-me thing.

28:51.596 --> 28:52.798
No. I mean, you're stupid.

28:54.165 --> 28:57.302
I mean... I don't mean that.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.570
No, I think maybe I do.

28:59.605 --> 29:01.707
Wow. With sweet talk
like that,

29:01.740 --> 29:03.275
you'll definitely
melt my reservations.

29:03.308 --> 29:04.943
I'm serious.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.644
You have this twisted way
of looking at things,

29:06.678 --> 29:08.780
this doom-and-gloom
mentality.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.449
You keep thinking
like that,

29:10.481 --> 29:12.151
and things are probably
gonna turn out

29:12.183 --> 29:13.652
just the way you expect.

29:13.684 --> 29:15.621
You know, there's nothing
more dangerous

29:15.653 --> 29:17.789
than a psych grad student.

29:17.824 --> 29:20.826
Buffy, where
is the bad here?

29:20.859 --> 29:23.895
It just turns out that
we're even more well-matched

29:23.930 --> 29:25.431
than we thought we were.

29:25.463 --> 29:26.898
I mean, you're a...

29:26.932 --> 29:29.434
fry cook, and so am I.

29:29.468 --> 29:31.403
Yes, but you're
an amateur...

29:31.436 --> 29:34.405
fry cook, and I come from
a long line of fry cooks

29:34.440 --> 29:36.275
that don't live past 25.

29:36.307 --> 29:38.410
Which is exactly the attitude
I'm talking about.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.778
Look, I know the risks
of what we do.

29:40.813 --> 29:43.481
I also know it's more rewarding
than any other job

29:43.515 --> 29:45.084
on the planet.
And fun.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.652
Fun?

29:46.684 --> 29:48.519
The last person I know
that believed that

29:48.554 --> 29:51.923
is in a coma right now because
she had so much fun on the job.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.791
Look, I'm not saying

29:53.826 --> 29:55.426
you shouldn't
take your work seriously.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.762
That I should just
turn my frown upside down?

29:57.796 --> 30:00.365
Is that it? I wish I could.

30:00.398 --> 30:03.134
But this isn't the kind of gig
where you can just hang it up

30:03.169 --> 30:04.803
at the end of the night
and snuggle with your honey.

30:04.836 --> 30:06.505
But why? Why can't it be?

30:06.538 --> 30:08.374
Because I tried it, okay?

30:08.406 --> 30:10.709
And every time,
it just fell apart.

30:10.741 --> 30:13.711
And then I get sucked right back
into the uber evil.

30:13.744 --> 30:15.181
Well, welcome to the story
of the world.

30:15.213 --> 30:16.949
Things fall apart, Buffy.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.351
And evil... it comes and goes.

30:19.384 --> 30:21.186
But the way people manage is

30:21.220 --> 30:22.453
they don't do it alone.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.789
They pull each other
through.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.992
If you weren't so self-involved,
you'd see that.

30:28.826 --> 30:31.998
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

30:32.030 --> 30:34.732
You barely know me.

30:34.766 --> 30:37.802
I know that it's not
just the job thing.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.006
I'm sure that there's
some good-looking guy

30:40.038 --> 30:41.807
who done you wrong
in there, too.

30:41.839 --> 30:44.576
But mostly, I think you want
to stay down in the dark place.

30:44.609 --> 30:47.046
'Cause maybe
it's safer down there.

30:47.078 --> 30:48.814
You are so out of line.

30:48.846 --> 30:51.083
No. See, I don't think so.

30:51.116 --> 30:55.487
Look, we have an opportunity
here, you and me.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.023
And the fact that you're too
scared to even give it a try...

30:58.057 --> 30:59.892
Is my business.

30:59.925 --> 31:02.193
So why don't you
just leave me alone?

31:05.797 --> 31:07.598
Fair enough.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.013
Great.
No Word of Valios.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.714
Not even a syllable
of Valios.

31:23.749 --> 31:25.384
Which means
I'm one step closer

31:25.416 --> 31:27.219
to melting in a sea
of molten hellfire, yeah?

31:27.252 --> 31:29.188
You shouldn't
talk like that.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.123
Yeah, okay, so you
can't kill anymore,

31:31.156 --> 31:32.758
but there's other
fun things you can do.

31:32.790 --> 31:34.026
You'll adjust.

31:34.059 --> 31:36.095
Adjust.

31:36.127 --> 31:38.896
And what, end up
like the two of you?

31:38.931 --> 31:41.532
No, thank you.
Here it goes:

31:41.567 --> 31:44.369
"We just can't leave him here to
stake himself. It's not right."

31:44.403 --> 31:45.737
I should think
you would be glad

31:45.770 --> 31:47.638
to greet the end of days.

31:47.673 --> 31:51.542
I mean, neither one of you
is making much of a go at it.

31:51.576 --> 31:54.579
You-- kids your age
are going off to university.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.281
You've made it as far
as the basement.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.784
And Red here, you couldn't even

31:58.817 --> 32:00.419
keep dog boy happy.

32:00.451 --> 32:03.288
I mean, you can take the loser
out of high school, but...

32:03.321 --> 32:04.890
I see what
you're doing--

32:04.923 --> 32:06.491
you're trying
to get us to dust you.

32:06.525 --> 32:09.494
Am not. I just don't
want pity from geeks

32:09.528 --> 32:11.130
more useless than I am.

32:11.163 --> 32:14.599
We're not useless.
We... we help people.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.835
We-we fight the forces of evil.

32:16.867 --> 32:18.971
Buffy fights the forces of evil.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.939
You're her groupies.

32:20.972 --> 32:23.575
She'd do just as well
without you.

32:23.608 --> 32:24.910
Better, I'd wager,

32:24.942 --> 32:26.311
since she wouldn't
have to go about

32:26.345 --> 32:27.746
saving your hides
all the time.

32:27.778 --> 32:29.414
That is so not true.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.583
We're part of the team.
She needs us.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.152
Or you're just
the same

32:33.184 --> 32:35.586
tenth-grade losers
you've always been,

32:35.621 --> 32:38.856
and she's too much of
a softy to cut you loose.

32:54.972 --> 32:58.044
Oh, as usual...

32:58.076 --> 33:00.078
dear.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.039
(growling)

33:28.074 --> 33:29.575
(grunting)

33:33.711 --> 33:35.012
(thumping)

33:40.185 --> 33:41.920
What happened?

33:41.952 --> 33:43.355
It's my fault,

33:43.388 --> 33:44.823
I should have known.

33:44.855 --> 33:46.491
Giles...

33:46.525 --> 33:48.227
The Word of Valios...

33:48.259 --> 33:51.529
is the name of a talisman,
not a book.

33:51.563 --> 33:54.566
I blame myself entirely.
I had-had it here.

33:54.599 --> 33:56.167
XANDER:
You had it here?
Okay, first

33:56.201 --> 33:57.769
I thought you were being too
hard on yourself, but...

33:57.802 --> 33:59.704
Oh, thank you.

33:59.738 --> 34:02.708
I bought it at
a sorcerer's estate sale.

34:02.740 --> 34:03.842
I really only
glanced at it once.

34:03.875 --> 34:04.942
I thought it was
a knockoff.

34:04.976 --> 34:07.113
Well, they have it.

34:07.145 --> 34:09.414
And they probably have
their sacrifices by now, too.

34:09.447 --> 34:12.016
They're on their way
to perform the sacrifice now.

34:12.050 --> 34:15.353
On their way where? You found
out what the ritual is for?

34:15.387 --> 34:16.755
The Hellmouth.

34:16.788 --> 34:20.525
They're gonna
open the Hellmouth.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.626
The one in the library.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.469
Looks like we're going
back to high school.

34:46.184 --> 34:48.052
Be careful, you guys.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.157
The place doesn't
look too stable.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.090
Fine by me.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.760
I hope we all go under.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.094
Why is he
even here?

34:56.128 --> 34:57.762
It's not like
he can fight.

34:57.795 --> 35:00.931
If we leave him alone,
he'll stake himself.

35:00.965 --> 35:03.501
And that's bad
because...

35:03.534 --> 35:05.137
Fine. Whatever.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.172
Just keep him
out of the way.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.007
I do not have
time for this.

35:09.039 --> 35:11.742
Okay, when we get
to the library,

35:11.777 --> 35:13.244
keep a lookout
for victims

35:13.278 --> 35:14.646
they're keeping alive
for the sacrifice.

35:14.679 --> 35:16.581
Getting them out is
the first priority.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.483
Will do.

35:18.516 --> 35:22.288
Okay.
You guys ready?

35:22.320 --> 35:24.255
Let's rock 'n' roll.

35:24.289 --> 35:28.059
(sighs)
Let's rock 'n' roll.

35:31.896 --> 35:34.266
Sunnydale High.

35:34.300 --> 35:37.668
If these walls
were still walls,

35:37.702 --> 35:40.472
what stories
they could tell.

35:40.505 --> 35:42.541
Ew.

35:44.742 --> 35:47.478
Mayor meat.
Extra crispy.

35:53.385 --> 35:57.389
I think we're
near the library.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.425
(demons chanting softly)

36:06.164 --> 36:09.800
Whoa. Check out
the new floor plan.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.237
BUFFY:
Three of them.

36:16.442 --> 36:19.077
I don't see
any sacrifice people.

36:19.110 --> 36:21.646
They must be around
here somewhere.

36:21.679 --> 36:24.048
Ritual's
not finished.

36:24.081 --> 36:25.817
And it's not
gonna be.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.952
(footsteps approaching)

36:30.054 --> 36:31.757
(grunting, growling)

36:40.731 --> 36:41.967
XANDER:
The blood!

36:44.202 --> 36:47.539
Get the talisman.
They can't do the ritual.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.311
I've got the bones!

36:56.882 --> 36:57.315
Here.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.590
You're picking
on the wrong guy, dude.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.293
I had a lot of practice
with my lunch money.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.195
Spike.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.630
Right. Perfect.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.478
Okay, I guess I won.

37:27.512 --> 37:29.315
(rumbling)

37:30.581 --> 37:32.318
The demons--

37:32.351 --> 37:33.652
they are the sacrifice.

37:40.791 --> 37:42.427
(yells)

37:45.797 --> 37:47.865
No pain.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.670
I can hurt a demon.

38:00.545 --> 38:03.014
That's right. I'm back,

38:03.047 --> 38:06.385
and I'm a bloody animal.
Yeah!

38:10.789 --> 38:12.324
No!
Spike, not in the hole!

38:15.661 --> 38:17.027
(rumbling)

38:19.465 --> 38:21.733
What? I was helping.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.876
Get out of here.
The building's gonna come down.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.266
(grunts)

38:58.869 --> 39:00.137
Don't let him jump
in the Hellmouth.

39:00.170 --> 39:02.106
If he does,
we're finished.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.119
(grunts)

39:21.226 --> 39:22.960
I'm going in.

39:26.597 --> 39:27.599
You're coming back out.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.115
(click)

39:48.554 --> 39:50.556
(grunting)

40:17.347 --> 40:19.851
Buffy.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.025
(rumbling stops)

40:34.132 --> 40:36.134
Well, hey. Willow.

40:36.166 --> 40:39.237
And Xander,
right?

40:39.269 --> 40:41.507
Jeez, what are
the chances, huh?

40:41.539 --> 40:43.007
Yeah, I was just
passing by,

40:43.041 --> 40:45.911
and I thought
I heard people inside.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.947
You were just passing by
in your G.I. Joe outfit?

40:51.983 --> 40:54.786
No offense, but you do
look wicked conspicuous.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.021
I do?

40:56.054 --> 40:57.688
But...

40:57.722 --> 41:00.257
Paint ball. Yeah. I was...
I was playing paint ball,

41:00.291 --> 41:01.693
and then the aftershock,
and I came...

41:01.726 --> 41:03.762
So you're one of
the commando guys, huh?

41:03.795 --> 41:05.697
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Commando? No.

41:05.731 --> 41:07.532
I mean...

41:07.565 --> 41:09.333
Do I know you?

41:09.367 --> 41:10.768
(terrible American accent):
Me? No.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.637
No, sir.

41:12.670 --> 41:15.306
I'm just an old pal
of Xander's here.

41:15.340 --> 41:17.543
RILEY:
Oh, that's nice.

41:24.349 --> 41:26.150
It's kind of weird
being back, isn't it?

41:26.184 --> 41:29.788
Yeah. Everything
seems so small...

41:29.820 --> 41:32.222
and more charred
and ruiny.

41:51.442 --> 41:52.677
(knocking)

41:52.710 --> 41:55.280
Come in.

42:02.554 --> 42:03.922
You never called,

42:03.954 --> 42:05.190
so I didn't know...

42:05.222 --> 42:06.423
Oh. Hey...
I'm sorry.

42:06.456 --> 42:08.393
I'm just...

42:08.425 --> 42:09.827
I'm a dead man.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.496
Secret. Highly.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.532
Or it's supposed to be.

42:14.565 --> 42:16.101
You know, and then
you find out.

42:16.134 --> 42:18.335
I can deal.
You're special.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.905
But last night
with your friends
was a disaster.

42:20.938 --> 42:22.340
I mean, could I have been
less convincing?

42:22.373 --> 42:24.675
I was trained to be
sneaky and stuff,

42:24.710 --> 42:27.277
and I'm, like... "Hi.
Paint ball, just passing by."

42:27.311 --> 42:28.512
I should have
just given them

42:28.545 --> 42:30.514
my security code and rank.

42:30.547 --> 42:31.682
You have a security code
and rank?

42:31.717 --> 42:33.784
No.

42:33.818 --> 42:36.186
Did I just say...

42:36.221 --> 42:38.222
This is so not good.

42:41.659 --> 42:42.893
Everybody knows
about me.

42:42.927 --> 42:45.096
I'm finished.

42:45.130 --> 42:46.396
It's the end of the world.

42:52.737 --> 42:55.940
No, it's not.

43:07.284 --> 43:09.086
(TV playing quietly)

43:09.119 --> 43:11.389
MAN:
It's snowing out there.
What's this?

43:11.422 --> 43:12.757
Sitting around
and watching the telly

43:12.791 --> 43:14.125
while there's evil still afoot.

43:14.159 --> 43:15.661
It's not very
industrious of you.

43:15.693 --> 43:18.829
I say we go out there

43:18.864 --> 43:21.065
and kick a little demon ass.

43:21.099 --> 43:25.003
What? Can't go without
your Buffy, is that it?

43:25.036 --> 43:26.271
Too chicken?

43:26.304 --> 43:27.773
Let's find her.

43:27.806 --> 43:29.239
She is the chosen one,
after all.

43:29.273 --> 43:30.809
Come on!

43:30.842 --> 43:34.079
Vampires! Grr. Nasty!

43:34.112 --> 43:36.181
Let's annihilate them.

43:36.213 --> 43:37.983
For justice and for...

43:38.016 --> 43:39.349
the safety of puppies...

43:39.384 --> 43:41.318
and Christmas, right?

43:41.351 --> 43:44.422
Let's fight that evil.

43:44.454 --> 43:46.858
Let's kill something.

43:46.891 --> 43:49.327
SPIKE:
 Oh, come on!

44:23.661 --> 44:26.063
Grr. Argh.
