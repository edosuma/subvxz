02:40.125 --> 02:42.258
Tuna, egg, chicken?

02:42.260 --> 02:43.893
Chicken and egg.

02:43.895 --> 02:44.997
Egg and tuna.

02:45.997 --> 02:47.564
- Let's see.
- Mm!

02:47.566 --> 02:48.401
Come on.

02:49.235 --> 02:50.500
Lemme have a look.

02:50.502 --> 02:51.337
Come on.

03:03.983 --> 03:06.385
She got caught.

03:08.486 --> 03:11.922
You said you always woke
up before she was caught.

03:11.924 --> 03:13.325
Not this time.

03:15.326 --> 03:18.330
You never thought
she was missing.

03:20.199 --> 03:24.400
Nobody panicked until after
she missed our birthday.

03:24.402 --> 03:25.969
She liked presents.

03:25.971 --> 03:27.571
Did she?

03:27.573 --> 03:28.408
Yes.

03:42.788 --> 03:45.689
Pills
can help the anxiety.

03:45.691 --> 03:48.358
But they can't make you sleep.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.330
I don't want to sleep.

03:51.562 --> 03:55.234
Let's go
back to the accident.

05:30.629 --> 05:31.631
Maude.

06:12.170 --> 06:14.837
How do you
feel about going home?

06:14.839 --> 06:16.241
Great.

06:17.341 --> 06:18.642
After tragedy...

06:18.644 --> 06:22.115
You keep talking about
it like she's dead.

06:23.548 --> 06:27.286
Do you
think she's still alive?

06:59.418 --> 07:01.351
Maude.

07:01.353 --> 07:02.551
Maude.

07:02.553 --> 07:03.786
Hey.

07:03.788 --> 07:05.454
Good to see you.

07:05.456 --> 07:06.858
- Oh.
- Long time.

07:07.925 --> 07:10.260
I got Ten to come pick you up.

07:10.262 --> 07:11.096
Cool?

07:14.733 --> 07:15.735
Long flight?

07:17.269 --> 07:19.105
- Three flights.
- Wow.

07:20.939 --> 07:22.542
I couldn't do that.

07:30.214 --> 07:33.617
See your mum hasn't
been feeling very well.

07:33.619 --> 07:37.790
- I could have got a taxi.
- No, no no, it's fine.

08:21.165 --> 08:23.168
You okay, Mum?

08:24.036 --> 08:25.538
Just a migraine.

08:26.437 --> 08:28.505
You still eat lamb, don't you?

08:28.507 --> 08:30.675
Yeah, yeah, I love lamb.

08:32.277 --> 08:34.143
It's good, Barry.

08:34.145 --> 08:36.477
Well I was gonna
do sausages, but I

08:36.480 --> 08:38.948
thought probably
get a lot of that.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.756
How do you feel?

08:46.758 --> 08:47.894
Fine, yeah.

08:49.260 --> 08:51.627
The doctor from
Germany asked me if

08:51.629 --> 08:53.897
our family had heart troubles.

08:53.899 --> 08:56.733
So I told him about
my great-uncle

08:56.735 --> 08:59.272
who had a stroke after the war.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.775
The house
looks really nice.

09:05.777 --> 09:07.410
Yeah, the front
garden's come along well

09:07.412 --> 09:09.579
since you were here.

09:09.581 --> 09:11.013
Have to show you.

09:11.015 --> 09:12.681
Ralph's been helping me paint.

09:12.683 --> 09:14.316
- Yeah.
- He said.

09:14.318 --> 09:15.919
It's good to have him 'round.

09:15.921 --> 09:18.287
Thanks, man.

09:18.289 --> 09:20.123
Are you gonna stay?

09:20.125 --> 09:21.757
For a bit.

09:21.759 --> 09:24.893
I put some fresh sheets out.

09:24.895 --> 09:28.833
It was beginning to get
a little damp in there.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.774
- You had a funeral.
- We did.

09:35.774 --> 09:37.706
It was a lovely service.

09:37.708 --> 09:38.944
Good turnout.

09:40.812 --> 09:42.914
Still seeing that doctor?

09:45.049 --> 09:48.050
Yes, she wants
me to sleep more.

09:48.052 --> 09:49.120
Sleep more?

09:56.495 --> 09:58.361
Do you want to ask
me something, Dad?

09:58.363 --> 10:00.597
You got the invite.

10:00.599 --> 10:01.930
You buried some wood.

10:01.932 --> 10:05.571
You crazy bitch.

10:07.873 --> 10:09.372
Tell us about
your new doctor...

10:09.374 --> 10:11.377
What did you just say?

10:17.548 --> 10:19.682
Do you wish it was me?

10:19.684 --> 10:22.786
- This is not about you.
- No, it never was!

10:22.788 --> 10:24.320
Did you really
hate her that much?

10:24.322 --> 10:25.655
I never hated her.

10:25.657 --> 10:26.492
Barry.

10:30.495 --> 10:32.661
This isn't easy on anyone.

10:32.663 --> 10:33.932
Look at Mother.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.068
You're hurting her face.

10:38.503 --> 10:41.171
- I didn't do anything.
- You didn't do anything.

10:41.173 --> 10:42.942
No, no of course not.

10:45.009 --> 10:46.177
Of course not.

10:48.580 --> 10:50.313
Let's all eat some lamb.

10:50.315 --> 10:51.150
Yeah.

11:25.783 --> 11:26.951
Hey.

11:28.153 --> 11:28.988
You okay?

11:40.030 --> 11:43.532
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to freak you out today.

11:43.534 --> 11:45.033
They like you.

11:45.035 --> 11:45.870
Yeah.

11:46.671 --> 11:47.840
Yeah, they do.

11:48.706 --> 11:51.040
I've been helpin' 'em

11:51.042 --> 11:53.546
organise some of Cleo's stuff.

11:54.412 --> 11:56.546
You should keep some of it.

11:56.548 --> 11:59.214
Take whatever you want.

11:59.216 --> 12:01.220
Don't need permission.

12:02.254 --> 12:04.623
I didn't mean it like that.

12:12.931 --> 12:13.766
Show-off.

12:15.866 --> 12:18.136
Do you think she's alive?

12:23.375 --> 12:24.940
I don't know.

12:24.942 --> 12:26.912
Then why are you here?

12:32.850 --> 12:35.019
I see her too, you know.

12:39.791 --> 12:41.293
I have this dream.

12:43.662 --> 12:46.963
I see her and she's in trouble,

12:46.965 --> 12:49.401
and I wanna reach out to her,

12:50.769 --> 12:52.538
and I wanna help her.

12:55.072 --> 12:56.074
But I can't.

13:01.846 --> 13:02.781
I miss her.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.990
I like the wedding ring.

13:12.524 --> 13:15.528
It's an engagement
ring, actually.

13:16.827 --> 13:18.663
I like the feel of it.

13:20.264 --> 13:23.065
She told me to keep it on.

13:23.067 --> 13:24.403
So I keep it on.

13:26.937 --> 13:31.107
She never said anything to
you, one day she was just gone?

13:31.109 --> 13:33.709
You sound like the cops.

13:33.711 --> 13:35.645
Henry Parker called me a lot.

13:35.647 --> 13:37.747
Yeah, I'll bet he did.

13:37.749 --> 13:41.019
- He was intense.
- He's fuckin' crazy.

13:43.654 --> 13:47.225
Him and your dad used
to talk all the time.

13:51.528 --> 13:54.263
Yeah, that makes sense.

13:54.265 --> 13:56.769
He even came to the funeral.

14:02.006 --> 14:06.177
This would have been such
a cool room, growin' up.

14:09.313 --> 14:11.317
Yeah, I guess.

14:17.221 --> 14:18.621
Good night, Barry.

14:18.623 --> 14:22.628
Night, Ralph.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.333
Hey, Ralph, um,

14:30.634 --> 14:32.200
um,

14:32.202 --> 14:33.038
thanks.

14:34.038 --> 14:35.537
That's all right.

14:35.539 --> 14:38.276
It's good just to
talk sometimes.

14:39.210 --> 14:40.045
Yeah.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.210
It is.

14:45.582 --> 14:47.986
I don't think you're crazy.

14:50.788 --> 14:51.954
Okay.

14:55.592 --> 14:56.427
See ya.

15:12.243 --> 15:15.377
Hey, Cleo's car,
does it still go?

15:15.379 --> 15:16.215
Mm.

15:56.553 --> 15:58.688
Henry?

15:58.690 --> 15:59.525
Maude.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.691
Sorry it's late.

16:02.693 --> 16:03.495
Come in.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.167
Thank you.

16:10.701 --> 16:11.769
- There.
- Oh.

16:21.546 --> 16:24.347
You okay, you want a drink?

16:24.349 --> 16:26.285
Oh, I'm okay.

16:27.451 --> 16:30.652
Don't usually
take house calls.

16:30.654 --> 16:33.388
Are you not police anymore?

16:33.390 --> 16:36.258
Three months' leave, got
a few things to sort out.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.361
I'm working from home.

16:38.363 --> 16:41.763
Is the case still open?

16:41.765 --> 16:43.932
Yeah, the case is still open.

16:43.934 --> 16:45.403
People drop off...

16:46.904 --> 16:47.905
Hi.

16:50.274 --> 16:52.941
Lisa, this is Maude.

16:52.943 --> 16:55.411
- We need some formula.
- Okay, give us minute.

16:55.413 --> 16:57.182
No, we need it now.

17:02.352 --> 17:03.853
I should go.

17:03.855 --> 17:05.857
Why did you come here?

17:11.796 --> 17:13.464
It hasn't stopped.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.269
I see her so clearly.

17:20.038 --> 17:24.339
She's in a room somewhere
and there's an old woman

17:24.342 --> 17:25.576
and sandwiches.

18:02.413 --> 18:05.584
This is the last
photo taken of her.

18:10.755 --> 18:11.924
Ralph took it.

19:54.959 --> 19:56.461
Everyone leaves.

19:59.529 --> 20:01.432
Is she in pain, Maudie?

20:08.972 --> 20:10.576
Will you come back?

20:33.530 --> 20:35.765
You okay?

20:35.767 --> 20:37.001
Fine.

20:38.102 --> 20:39.634
Thanks for doing this.

20:39.636 --> 20:42.640
Of course, we're
in this together.

20:46.044 --> 20:49.178
What really happened
between you two?

20:49.180 --> 20:50.682
Why did you leave?

20:53.084 --> 20:55.884
As
kids, I'd look in the mirror

20:55.886 --> 20:57.121
and see myself.

20:59.356 --> 21:02.991
But then I'd turn around and
she'd be standing behind me.

21:02.993 --> 21:05.561
That's being a
twin, Dad would say.

21:05.563 --> 21:06.965
Creepy.

21:08.532 --> 21:11.132
- I
- went away to be alone.

21:11.134 --> 21:15.273
But even on the other side of
the world, I couldn't escape.

21:16.708 --> 21:20.609
I can see her, and I'm the only
one who knows where she is.

21:20.611 --> 21:22.311
And I know this
all sounds crazy.

21:22.313 --> 21:24.846
You're not crazy.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.315
Maybe I am,

21:27.317 --> 21:29.684
but I'm gonna bring her home.

22:29.079 --> 22:31.013
Maude.

22:31.015 --> 22:32.113
Maudie!

23:16.160 --> 23:20.728
You havin' another
crack at the case, Henry?

23:20.730 --> 23:21.566
Henry.

23:24.234 --> 23:26.669
Are you here officially?

23:26.671 --> 23:28.370
Takin' some time off.

23:28.372 --> 23:30.275
- Personal time?
- Yeah.

23:32.844 --> 23:35.514
Feels pretty personal.

23:36.547 --> 23:38.482
Your dad was worried.

23:41.818 --> 23:45.856
Unbelievable.

24:33.538 --> 24:34.806
There she is.

24:36.440 --> 24:37.375
Right here.

25:02.700 --> 25:07.303
My sister came to you and now
she's locked in your house.

25:07.305 --> 25:08.139
Is she?

25:15.746 --> 25:16.581
Thanks.

25:26.624 --> 25:29.123
She wrote her name.

25:30.795 --> 25:33.094
She wrote her name here.

25:33.096 --> 25:34.098
On the wall.

25:35.532 --> 25:38.534
I swear to fucking
God I'm not crazy.

25:54.285 --> 25:56.388
How's it goin'?

25:57.488 --> 26:00.057
I'm gonna take a look around.

26:12.336 --> 26:14.436
Chicken and egg.

26:14.438 --> 26:15.774
Egg and chicken.

26:19.143 --> 26:21.145
You came back.

26:23.814 --> 26:26.418
At the time you said you would.

26:28.152 --> 26:28.987
Yeah.

26:36.961 --> 26:37.796
Yeah.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.435
Do you recognise me?

26:46.436 --> 26:49.771
I told you
stay in the car.

26:49.773 --> 26:52.610
Why, she recognised
me, she did.

26:56.146 --> 26:58.381
She sees a lot of things.

27:01.451 --> 27:03.054
No good with faces.

27:03.988 --> 27:05.390
Even pretty ones.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.066
Where is she?

27:16.032 --> 27:17.699
- Is she alive?
- Cunt!

27:17.701 --> 27:20.568
- Where is she?
- Hey, hey!

27:20.570 --> 27:21.903
Hey!

28:26.002 --> 28:27.568
Have you seen a big girl?

28:27.570 --> 28:28.839
She's disabled.

28:30.807 --> 28:33.241
She just came out
from that truck.

28:33.243 --> 28:34.611
She's a bit slow.

28:35.779 --> 28:36.614
Slow?

28:37.748 --> 28:40.349
Handicapped,
she's handicapped.

28:40.351 --> 28:41.186
Dumb.

29:15.553 --> 29:18.719
Can I get a van, a caravan?

29:25.496 --> 29:26.331
Romeo.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.042
Do you know who owns
this truck outside?

29:40.044 --> 29:41.209
Ben.

29:41.211 --> 29:42.046
Big Ben.

29:44.548 --> 29:45.383
Ben.

29:50.954 --> 29:53.625
We've gotta go a little further.

29:58.895 --> 30:00.528
This place is fucked.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.076
Romeo.

31:29.086 --> 31:31.687
I'll take the car.

31:31.689 --> 31:33.524
Mix with the locals.

31:34.657 --> 31:36.658
What's with you two?

31:36.660 --> 31:39.430
He thinks I
killed your sister.

31:42.665 --> 31:45.068
- Did you?
- That's not funny.

31:46.636 --> 31:47.471
Hey.

31:49.105 --> 31:53.278
He followed us here, do you
think that's a bit weird?

31:54.211 --> 31:56.143
He wants to find her.

31:56.145 --> 31:58.279
I don't think it's weird.

31:58.281 --> 31:59.914
Not anymore.

31:59.916 --> 32:01.151
Okay.

32:03.586 --> 32:06.321
Those chicks were twins,
do you think that's weird?

32:06.323 --> 32:08.690
This whole place is weird.

32:46.829 --> 32:47.664
Hey!

33:30.106 --> 33:31.605
Hey.

33:31.607 --> 33:32.609
Hey it's me.

33:33.943 --> 33:35.113
Cleo, it's me.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.083
- It's me.
- No it isn't.

33:40.483 --> 33:42.817
I'm Maude, I'm her sister.

33:42.819 --> 33:45.319
I know who you are.

33:45.321 --> 33:46.921
You do?

33:46.923 --> 33:48.358
I'm not stupid.

33:51.728 --> 33:52.960
Where is she?

33:52.962 --> 33:55.863
You came all this
way to find her.

33:55.865 --> 33:59.133
I have six siblings:
three are brothers,

33:59.135 --> 34:01.769
won't go anywhere for them.

34:01.771 --> 34:05.009
My brother Kieran,
he tortured my cat.

34:06.242 --> 34:08.413
I have that cat somewhere.

34:10.547 --> 34:12.617
I glued it back together.

34:14.083 --> 34:17.818
Fuckin' bitch.

34:17.820 --> 34:21.590
Please, do you
know where she is?

34:21.592 --> 34:22.927
The big house.

34:23.793 --> 34:24.694
In the sky.

34:26.163 --> 34:29.097
You can sleep forever there.

34:29.099 --> 34:30.168
It's magical.

34:33.469 --> 34:34.802
Hey!

34:34.804 --> 34:36.973
Fuck, I'm sorry.

34:41.244 --> 34:43.177
You're really pretty.

34:43.179 --> 34:44.014
Ben.

35:01.632 --> 35:02.733
I'm Nerida.

35:04.835 --> 35:05.903
Are you okay?

35:08.105 --> 35:10.572
How long was she here for?

35:10.574 --> 35:11.675
A few days.

35:13.177 --> 35:16.211
And then all of a
sudden she disappeared.

35:16.213 --> 35:17.945
And was
she with anyone?

35:17.947 --> 35:19.648
- Yeah.
- She had a bunch of friends.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.085
- Yeah.
- Friendly.

35:22.186 --> 35:24.019
Did she say where
she was going next?

35:24.021 --> 35:25.523
- No.
- She didn't.

35:26.989 --> 35:29.824
That girl mentioned
a big house.

35:29.826 --> 35:31.425
That girl is nuts.

35:31.427 --> 35:32.927
She's autistic.

35:32.929 --> 35:35.130
Retarded, fat, she's
got a bunch of problems.

35:35.132 --> 35:36.697
She's troubled.

35:36.699 --> 35:40.068
She has some troubles,
yes, sorry, Doctor.

35:40.070 --> 35:42.970
- You're a doctor.
- I am, I'm on break.

35:42.972 --> 35:44.371
Where are you from?

35:44.373 --> 35:46.240
Oh, where am I from.

35:46.242 --> 35:50.010
Hmm, I was born in Germany
and then raised in a castle,

35:50.012 --> 35:51.845
spent some time all over Europe.

35:51.847 --> 35:55.249
And then we met in
Bristol.

35:55.251 --> 35:58.019
Forgive me, is there
anything you can tell us?

35:58.021 --> 35:59.787
No, not much, we just...

35:59.789 --> 36:00.722
You must be Ralph.

36:00.724 --> 36:02.490
- Must I?
- Keith.

36:02.492 --> 36:03.992
- Hi.
- My wife, Nerida.

36:03.994 --> 36:05.594
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

36:05.596 --> 36:06.927
Come, have a seat.

36:06.929 --> 36:08.095
Oh, thanks.

36:08.097 --> 36:09.697
Where've you been?

36:09.699 --> 36:11.499
I went for a walk.

36:11.501 --> 36:13.070
- Fish?
- No thanks.

36:14.403 --> 36:15.806
I'm very sorry.

36:17.074 --> 36:19.409
This place is interesting.

36:20.777 --> 36:22.644
It's a good place.

36:22.646 --> 36:24.345
Lots of friendly people.

36:24.347 --> 36:27.481
- Not everyone's friendly.
- Big Ben's harmless.

36:27.483 --> 36:29.516
Did Cleo meet Big Ben?

36:29.518 --> 36:31.188
- I doubt it.
- What?

36:33.623 --> 36:35.458
- What?
- Cleo was here.

36:44.101 --> 36:48.271
Okay, a father and a son
are in a horrible car crash.

36:49.672 --> 36:51.274
Father gets killed.

36:52.342 --> 36:55.644
And the son is rushed
to the hospital

36:55.646 --> 36:57.048
and just as about

36:58.215 --> 37:00.483
he's going under the knife,

37:03.519 --> 37:06.054
the surgeon says,
"Sorry, can't do that.

37:06.056 --> 37:07.724
"That boy's my son."

37:10.726 --> 37:12.760
The surgeon is
the son's mother.

37:12.762 --> 37:13.597
Good.

37:17.400 --> 37:21.571
By third year, I think, they
started taking me seriously.

37:23.172 --> 37:24.639
As smart as the boys?

37:24.641 --> 37:25.476
Smarter.

37:26.909 --> 37:29.913
But don't tell,
don't ever tell 'em.

37:40.824 --> 37:42.891
I'm sorry about your sister.

37:48.699 --> 37:49.934
Were you close?

37:53.070 --> 37:54.238
We're twins.

37:57.807 --> 37:59.976
That means you're close.

38:29.206 --> 38:32.106
So Maude
tracked her here.

38:32.108 --> 38:33.775
She did.

38:33.777 --> 38:35.809
Not you, Henry.

38:35.811 --> 38:36.913
No, not me.

38:38.382 --> 38:39.215
Not him.

38:40.182 --> 38:42.983
- She was unpredictable.
- I bet.

38:42.985 --> 38:46.186
A loose cannon, she
kept weird company.

38:46.188 --> 38:48.856
Most people thought
she'd just run away.

38:48.858 --> 38:50.592
I was the prime suspect.

38:50.594 --> 38:52.262
- Really?
- Wasn't I?

38:53.463 --> 38:55.295
Last one
to see her alive.

38:55.297 --> 38:58.133
Yeah well, we were
getting married, so.

38:58.135 --> 39:00.300
Tend to see a bit of each other.

39:00.302 --> 39:02.670
We found her wedding
ring in your car.

39:02.672 --> 39:03.505
Our car.

39:04.840 --> 39:08.011
You found her wedding
ring in our car.

39:09.146 --> 39:10.981
You're all levities.

39:12.382 --> 39:16.119
Whatever, man.

39:17.820 --> 39:19.153
Can I see that?

39:19.155 --> 39:20.990
- Oh, it's just...
- Oh.

39:21.925 --> 39:23.094
It's a rabbit.

39:23.960 --> 39:24.795
It's cute.

39:32.735 --> 39:35.470
Our house backed onto bush.

39:35.472 --> 39:36.874
A nature reserve.

39:38.275 --> 39:42.213
Cleo and I loved to play
hide and seek with our dad.

39:43.079 --> 39:45.416
We called it catch-a-rabbit.

39:47.083 --> 39:49.650
And I used to always
hide with her,

39:49.652 --> 39:51.952
'cause she always had
the best hiding spots.

39:51.954 --> 39:53.521
Hmm.

39:53.523 --> 39:56.427
And I was scared
to be on my own.

39:57.860 --> 40:01.664
She let me squeeze in to a
small cave that she'd found,

40:03.699 --> 40:07.103
or bury me behind the
branches and sticks

40:08.271 --> 40:11.409
that she'd fashioned
into a cubby hole.

40:13.076 --> 40:15.211
She was really good at it.

40:16.378 --> 40:18.949
And then we'd wait for a while.

40:21.650 --> 40:25.321
And then I'd accidentally
giggle or whisper.

40:26.523 --> 40:28.856
And then she'd pull me close,

40:28.858 --> 40:30.657
she'd look me
straight in the eye,

40:30.659 --> 40:33.463
and she'd say,
"Don't say a word."

40:36.032 --> 40:39.333
And then she'd
grab onto my wrist,

40:39.335 --> 40:42.403
and squeeze it really tightly,

40:42.405 --> 40:45.643
and then she'd twist
it until I yelped.

40:47.143 --> 40:48.045
Like a dog.

40:51.847 --> 40:55.485
And then she'd disappear
and I'd be caught.

40:56.519 --> 40:57.387
The rabbit.

41:01.992 --> 41:04.124
I fell for it every time.

41:10.534 --> 41:11.865
Ralph!

41:11.867 --> 41:12.702
Stop it!

41:13.769 --> 41:15.369
Stop it, don't.

41:15.371 --> 41:18.875
Stop it!

41:20.643 --> 41:21.943
He came at me.

41:21.945 --> 41:23.380
You started it.

41:26.115 --> 41:28.148
You're
being ridiculous.

41:28.150 --> 41:29.316
Sorry.

41:29.318 --> 41:30.150
- Maude...
- You're sorry.

41:30.152 --> 41:31.888
It's okay.

41:37.293 --> 41:38.862
She's in a cabin.

41:40.563 --> 41:43.197
And there's a man with her.

41:43.199 --> 41:45.436
He's got a mask on, like a,

41:46.503 --> 41:48.639
like a clumsy animal mask.

41:55.811 --> 41:58.414
Are you in love with my sister?

42:03.052 --> 42:06.653
I don't know what
I'm doing anymore.

42:06.655 --> 42:11.258
I spent so long looking at
her face in that little room.

42:11.260 --> 42:14.532
My life is...

42:18.702 --> 42:22.840
All I know is the things
you say make sense to me.

42:31.914 --> 42:34.518
God, you look so much like her.

42:41.458 --> 42:43.626
I'm gonna find her, Maude.

42:48.030 --> 42:49.666
I'm gonna find her.

49:03.139 --> 49:04.972
Where is my sister?

49:04.974 --> 49:06.240
- Sh.
- He said that twins

49:06.242 --> 49:08.575
have a special claim
upon our attention.

49:08.577 --> 49:11.545
It is that their history
affords means of distinguishing

49:11.547 --> 49:14.548
between the effects of
tendencies received at birth

49:14.550 --> 49:15.883
and those that were imposed

49:15.885 --> 49:18.885
by the special circumstances
of their lives.

49:18.887 --> 49:20.987
Ah, thank you, Rita.

49:20.989 --> 49:21.891
Breakfast.

49:24.327 --> 49:26.029
What, what is this?

49:27.630 --> 49:29.262
What did you put in me?

49:29.264 --> 49:30.798
Took a little blood, was all.

49:30.800 --> 49:32.235
Are you hungry?

49:36.972 --> 49:40.309
- Clean her up.
- No, let her eat first.

49:44.746 --> 49:46.313
Mm.

49:46.315 --> 49:47.514
Mm.

49:47.516 --> 49:48.951
Thank you, Lydia.

49:51.219 --> 49:53.287
Eat something.

49:53.289 --> 49:54.124
Hmm?

49:55.157 --> 49:56.326
You're hungry.

49:57.960 --> 49:59.195
Very important.

50:04.367 --> 50:06.066
Good walk, Jess?

50:06.068 --> 50:08.568
Oh, Jess, why did you do that?

50:08.570 --> 50:11.171
I don't take coffee,
you know that.

50:11.173 --> 50:12.409
Come, sit down.

50:13.576 --> 50:15.742
You don't have to be scared.

50:15.744 --> 50:19.248
My poor girl, it's
just a small procedure.

50:20.483 --> 50:22.583
Oh, Maude, this is...

50:22.585 --> 50:24.985
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

50:24.987 --> 50:26.487
She just needs time.

51:32.255 --> 51:36.090
I'll be here when
you wake up, okay?

51:36.092 --> 51:37.994
You won't feel a thing.

51:39.061 --> 51:41.498
Now remember what I told you.

51:42.398 --> 51:43.633
You're strong.

51:46.501 --> 51:48.401
You're a girl.

51:48.403 --> 51:49.239
Okay.

51:53.509 --> 51:55.644
She's a good one, Nelly.

52:03.518 --> 52:04.420
Sit down.

52:15.530 --> 52:16.932
You feel better?

52:19.434 --> 52:21.438
Running away won't help.

52:34.916 --> 52:36.249
Hey.

52:36.251 --> 52:38.989
- Where is my sister?
- Calm down.

52:40.956 --> 52:42.923
Tell us what she shows you.

52:42.925 --> 52:45.092
What are you talking about?

52:45.094 --> 52:46.559
Tell us what she shows you.

52:46.561 --> 52:47.894
What do you mean, what?

52:47.896 --> 52:50.898
She's been missing
for a year, what...

52:50.900 --> 52:53.800
You fucking freaks,
where is my sister?

52:53.802 --> 52:55.936
- Jonathon.
- I need to see my sister!

52:55.938 --> 52:57.771
Jonathon.

52:57.773 --> 52:59.340
Jonathon.

52:59.342 --> 53:00.677
She's our guest.

53:01.844 --> 53:03.813
- Just a few tests.
- Yes.

53:04.713 --> 53:07.780
And then you'll get to see her.

53:07.782 --> 53:09.719
I need you to trust me.

53:14.489 --> 53:15.324
Trust.

54:10.445 --> 54:14.617
Good morning, I'm sorry,
I'm running a little bit late.

54:17.820 --> 54:20.153
I'm going to ask you
some basic questions.

54:20.155 --> 54:22.690
Just answer quickly, and try
not to filter your answer

54:22.692 --> 54:24.891
or to anticipate what you
think we want to hear.

54:24.893 --> 54:28.295
There is no right answer,
only a false answer.

54:28.297 --> 54:29.798
What is your name?

54:30.733 --> 54:32.398
Maude Ashton.

54:32.400 --> 54:35.668
What is your earliest memory?

54:35.670 --> 54:36.603
What?

54:36.605 --> 54:39.505
What is your earliest memory?

54:39.507 --> 54:40.509
Don't think.

54:41.911 --> 54:44.313
- Why?
- Your earliest memory.

54:48.483 --> 54:51.184
Getting lost on a picnic and

54:51.186 --> 54:53.354
being caught
outside in the rain.

54:53.356 --> 54:56.523
What are
you feeling right now?

54:56.525 --> 54:59.525
Anger, fear, frustration.

54:59.527 --> 55:00.728
Hate.

55:00.730 --> 55:03.664
What do you think
of your parents?

55:03.666 --> 55:04.965
I just wanna see my sister.

55:04.967 --> 55:06.867
Answer the question.

55:06.869 --> 55:08.235
My parents are my parents.

55:08.237 --> 55:10.804
Do you love your parents?

55:10.806 --> 55:12.039
Yes.

55:12.041 --> 55:15.412
What is your happiest
memory of growing up?

55:16.612 --> 55:18.112
Christmas.

55:18.114 --> 55:20.414
Would you say you
were easy to excite?

55:20.416 --> 55:21.251
No.

55:22.418 --> 55:23.916
Yes.

55:23.918 --> 55:26.987
Would you say
that you're easy to excite?

55:26.989 --> 55:28.222
No.

55:28.224 --> 55:29.655
Would you say that
you were impatient?

55:29.657 --> 55:30.791
Yes.

55:30.793 --> 55:33.663
What is your
biggest, greatest fear?

55:35.597 --> 55:37.433
Being alone.

55:38.333 --> 55:39.335
Dying alone.

55:42.838 --> 55:45.842
Are you
scared right now?

55:47.041 --> 55:49.813
What do you want
to do right now?

55:50.646 --> 55:53.115
I want to kill you.

55:56.885 --> 55:57.920
What is this?

56:03.025 --> 56:04.525
Do you
resent your sister?

56:04.527 --> 56:07.059
- Fuck you.
- Answer the question.

56:07.061 --> 56:08.664
Fuck you!

56:14.068 --> 56:15.869
What is your name?

56:15.871 --> 56:17.604
Cleo Ashton.

56:17.606 --> 56:20.541
What
is your earliest memory?

56:20.543 --> 56:21.809
I got lost on a picnic,

56:21.811 --> 56:24.644
and I got caught
outside in the rain.

56:24.646 --> 56:26.512
How
are you feeling right now.

56:26.514 --> 56:28.248
- What...
- Frustration.

56:28.250 --> 56:30.184
I just want to see my sister.

56:30.186 --> 56:31.818
- Angry...
- I just want...

56:31.820 --> 56:33.052
Dammit,

56:33.054 --> 56:35.054
let me out of here!

56:35.056 --> 56:38.025
My sister.

56:38.027 --> 56:39.525
Answer the question.

56:39.527 --> 56:41.061
My parents
are my parents.

56:41.063 --> 56:42.563
Do
you love your parents?

56:42.565 --> 56:43.666
Yes.

56:45.166 --> 56:49.036
What is your favourite
memory from growing up?

56:49.038 --> 56:51.405
Christmas.

56:51.407 --> 56:53.740
Would you say
you're easy to excite?

56:53.742 --> 56:54.874
No.

56:54.876 --> 56:55.809
- Yes.
- Would you say

56:55.811 --> 56:57.478
that you're easy to excite?

56:57.480 --> 56:59.146
Uh, no.

56:59.148 --> 57:02.385
What is
your greatest fear?

57:03.818 --> 57:07.454
Being
alone, dying alone.

57:07.456 --> 57:10.023
Are you
scared right now?

57:10.025 --> 57:11.992
Yeah.

58:04.713 --> 58:07.880
That rain just
keeps on coming.

58:07.882 --> 58:09.816
Aren't you cold?

58:09.818 --> 58:11.117
Huh?

58:11.119 --> 58:13.422
Here, that'll keep you warm.

58:15.490 --> 58:17.994
I'll get you some golden milk.

58:21.396 --> 58:22.931
Just a few minutes.

58:24.365 --> 58:25.601
- Ralph!
- What?

58:26.501 --> 58:27.333
- Ralph.
- What?

58:27.335 --> 58:28.601
Ralph.

58:28.603 --> 58:30.202
Where are we?

58:30.204 --> 58:32.873
They did
something to my eyes.

58:32.875 --> 58:34.641
What can I...

58:34.643 --> 58:36.510
- Sorry.
- Fuck.

58:36.512 --> 58:37.344
Fuck.

58:37.346 --> 58:39.179
You must be so hurt.

58:39.181 --> 58:41.117
I saw her, she's alive.

58:42.284 --> 58:43.516
They're making me
do these tests.

58:43.518 --> 58:44.617
- Oh, God.
- I have to,

58:44.619 --> 58:45.686
but I saw her.

58:45.688 --> 58:47.688
Just do whatever he
tells you to do, okay?

58:47.690 --> 58:49.322
Whatever

58:49.324 --> 58:50.624
Ralph!

58:50.626 --> 58:52.258
- Ralph!
- Maude,

58:52.260 --> 58:53.496
you were right.

59:06.909 --> 59:09.309
It's okay.

59:09.311 --> 59:12.148
You need to rest
whenever you can.

59:20.389 --> 59:22.492
You will do so well here.

59:27.362 --> 59:29.396
Ralph!

59:29.398 --> 59:30.831
Ralph!

59:30.833 --> 59:32.199
Maude!

59:37.405 --> 59:39.208
You freaks!

59:40.608 --> 59:41.443
Shit!

01:00:23.552 --> 01:00:25.021
How do you feel?

01:00:31.592 --> 01:00:32.427
Relaxed.

01:00:35.396 --> 01:00:36.530
Okay.

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:38.065
Maude.

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:41.601
I would like you to
look at my finger.

01:00:41.603 --> 01:00:43.106
And now follow it.

01:00:47.041 --> 01:00:48.543
You're doing well.

01:00:50.612 --> 01:00:52.278
Just follow

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.115
my finger.

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:18.040
Where are you?

01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:21.043
I can't see you.

01:01:21.909 --> 01:01:22.811
Come to me.

01:01:29.451 --> 01:01:30.385
Come to me.

01:01:47.536 --> 01:01:50.003
Maude, I need you to come.

01:01:58.045 --> 01:01:59.314
Come on, Maude.

01:02:02.083 --> 01:02:03.919
Come a little further.

01:02:21.903 --> 01:02:23.106
Please.

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:48.864
You've never been that close?

01:02:50.998 --> 01:02:52.334
We're sisters.

01:02:57.239 --> 01:02:59.976
Why doesn't
she like you?

01:03:01.143 --> 01:03:03.610
Stop!

01:03:07.916 --> 01:03:09.684
It's okay, Lisbeth.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:11.653
It's okay.

01:03:19.527 --> 01:03:21.429
She will come for me.

01:03:23.197 --> 01:03:26.034
Cleo!

01:03:31.773 --> 01:03:32.775
It's okay.

01:03:34.409 --> 01:03:35.244
Sh.

01:03:54.963 --> 01:03:56.566
Untie me, please.

01:03:57.733 --> 01:04:00.303
Why don't
you use my name?

01:04:01.436 --> 01:04:04.938
They'll kill you if
you run out that door.

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.407
Doesn't matter how
fast you can run.

01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:09.811
Please, Richie.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.695
Wait.

01:04:33.001 --> 01:04:34.804
I use it for my burns.

01:04:52.387 --> 01:04:53.990
What's going on?

01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:03.598
Why isn't she coming?

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:06.833
I'm trying.

01:05:13.041 --> 01:05:15.778
You're counting
on me, Lisbeth.

01:06:24.679 --> 01:06:26.014
There you are.

01:06:30.251 --> 01:06:31.253
Come inside.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.222
- Come to bed.
- It's her.

01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:38.358
She's sleeping.

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:39.762
- Right?
- She bled.

01:06:41.028 --> 01:06:41.931
Real blood.

01:06:45.233 --> 01:06:46.402
She came back.

01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:48.903
I know.

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:51.807
Come to bed.

01:06:56.677 --> 01:06:57.779
Good night.

01:07:27.809 --> 01:07:29.979
This is gonna sting a bit.

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:35.384
Hold still.

01:07:37.818 --> 01:07:38.653
You okay?

01:07:49.063 --> 01:07:50.832
Is that you and Cleo?

01:07:52.534 --> 01:07:53.536
The drawing.

01:07:56.271 --> 01:07:57.606
Who's Lisbeth?

01:08:02.543 --> 01:08:04.012
You see so much.

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:09.652
Is she your twin?

01:08:14.722 --> 01:08:17.656
You're lucky, you know that?

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:18.426
Lucky?

01:08:20.462 --> 01:08:21.296
Yeah.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:25.198
I used to cut myself.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.772
When I had a mark,

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:34.408
she had to have one too.

01:08:39.145 --> 01:08:40.649
Did you cut her?

01:08:46.988 --> 01:08:48.990
Did she hate you for it?

01:08:50.957 --> 01:08:54.893
My mother used to dress
us exactly the same way.

01:08:54.895 --> 01:08:55.997
Same haircut.

01:08:57.332 --> 01:08:58.399
Same dresses.

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:00.734
Always.

01:09:03.738 --> 01:09:05.073
That, she hated.

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:10.045
Where is she?

01:09:12.113 --> 01:09:13.282
She drowned.

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:31.619
Just take it off.

01:11:41.095 --> 01:11:43.929
You should take it off, Richie.

01:11:57.912 --> 01:11:58.747
You see?

01:12:00.448 --> 01:12:01.350
I'm sorry.

01:12:04.485 --> 01:12:06.285
Easy.

01:12:06.287 --> 01:12:07.222
Easy, easy.

01:12:09.023 --> 01:12:09.858
Easy.

01:12:16.631 --> 01:12:17.666
I'm sorry.

01:12:23.837 --> 01:12:24.672
Maude.

01:12:40.087 --> 01:12:42.590
We used to camp around here.

01:12:44.391 --> 01:12:46.795
This was our secret hideaway.

01:12:47.828 --> 01:12:49.831
We even had a trap door.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.837
This is where she found us.

01:12:59.073 --> 01:13:02.811
I'd like to think our
parents looked for us.

01:13:04.945 --> 01:13:07.048
My brother was so scared.

01:13:08.449 --> 01:13:09.283
So scared.

01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:14.152
Please,
Daddy, where are you?

01:13:14.154 --> 01:13:16.090
I had to protect him.

01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:21.893
So I gave them everything I had.

01:13:36.511 --> 01:13:37.913
Please.

01:13:41.582 --> 01:13:43.281
Come closer.

01:14:08.643 --> 01:14:09.645
Thank you.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.527
Come inside now,
you'll catch a chill.

01:16:26.747 --> 01:16:29.415
Council will
relay your findings.

01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:32.117
We have other things
for you to do now.

01:16:32.119 --> 01:16:34.019
Let me tell council.

01:16:34.021 --> 01:16:36.190
Let me relay the findings.

01:16:38.259 --> 01:16:40.561
Why is the boy still here?

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:44.229
Do
you keep them all?

01:16:44.231 --> 01:16:45.498
Not all of them.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.165
You care too much.

01:16:47.167 --> 01:16:48.804
That's my charter.

01:16:50.971 --> 01:16:53.240
We'll see you at council.

01:16:54.307 --> 01:16:55.808
Please let me do this.

01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:57.677
The job is done.

01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:59.780
Your job was to find her.

01:17:00.814 --> 01:17:01.983
I found her.

01:17:05.485 --> 01:17:06.852
I deserve this.

01:17:31.979 --> 01:17:33.548
You okay?

01:17:34.881 --> 01:17:35.716
Fine.

01:17:37.952 --> 01:17:40.419
What is it?

01:17:40.421 --> 01:17:42.423
Why did you call them?

01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:45.391
You've been distant.

01:17:45.393 --> 01:17:47.895
Something's going on with you.

01:17:49.329 --> 01:17:51.263
They were checking up on me.

01:17:51.265 --> 01:17:52.601
Yes they were.

01:17:53.434 --> 01:17:55.369
Pass me those clippers.

01:17:58.472 --> 01:18:01.943
They've been waiting
a long time for her.

01:18:03.077 --> 01:18:05.410
What are you doing?

01:18:05.412 --> 01:18:07.412
What do you mean?

01:18:07.414 --> 01:18:09.415
Don't screw these people.

01:18:09.417 --> 01:18:11.483
We have a chance here.

01:18:11.485 --> 01:18:14.186
Stop and smell the roses.

01:18:14.188 --> 01:18:16.354
We have a good life, don't we?

01:18:19.894 --> 01:18:22.297
You've nothing more to prove.

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:26.031
She'll do what her sister did,

01:18:26.033 --> 01:18:28.968
exactly the way you
said it would happen.

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:31.606
Everything else is in the past.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.710
Aiden's back.

01:18:36.377 --> 01:18:39.514
Good, I've missed
him about the house.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:54.395
You okay?

01:18:56.096 --> 01:18:56.931
Fine.

01:19:00.301 --> 01:19:02.433
You're angry with me.

01:19:02.435 --> 01:19:03.270
No.

01:19:08.208 --> 01:19:10.476
This'll all be over soon.

01:19:10.478 --> 01:19:11.410
I know.

01:19:11.412 --> 01:19:14.280
Now the journey will begin.

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:16.382
The future, moving up.

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:17.782
Of course.

01:19:17.784 --> 01:19:19.351
There he is!

01:19:19.353 --> 01:19:21.519
You look fantastic.

01:19:21.521 --> 01:19:22.923
Big handsome boy.

01:19:24.725 --> 01:19:28.294
Hey.

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:31.897
You have
a big sleep now.

01:19:50.618 --> 01:19:51.453
Thanks.

01:19:55.389 --> 01:19:57.057
He's coming for you.

01:19:59.527 --> 01:20:02.428
Me and him made
all this, I helped.

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:06.031
My sister told me that
you're the special one,

01:20:06.033 --> 01:20:08.770
and they've been
waiting for you.

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:17.578
Where's your sister?

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:20.115
Over the border.

01:20:21.481 --> 01:20:25.217
They told me that I
couldn't see her again

01:20:25.219 --> 01:20:26.855
and I believed them.

01:20:30.824 --> 01:20:32.993
What did they do to you?

01:20:35.128 --> 01:20:36.898
They made a hole in

01:20:37.864 --> 01:20:39.464
my stomach,

01:20:39.466 --> 01:20:41.302
and they took my baby.

01:20:42.136 --> 01:20:44.773
They wanted her to see that they

01:20:46.172 --> 01:20:48.009
hurt me to get to her.

01:20:56.684 --> 01:20:57.519
Hey.

01:20:58.685 --> 01:21:01.887
Let's go have a
nice tea together.

01:21:01.889 --> 01:21:04.822
Yeah, I'd like that,
we can be sisters.

01:21:04.824 --> 01:21:05.991
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:21:24.779 --> 01:21:26.081
Hey.

01:21:28.548 --> 01:21:31.784
We're just having some
cake downstairs for Jess,

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:33.485
if you're interested.

01:21:33.487 --> 01:21:34.989
It's her birthday.

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:39.227
She's been feelin'
a bit down, so.

01:21:40.493 --> 01:21:42.861
Yeah, sounds good.

01:21:42.863 --> 01:21:43.698
Right.

01:21:51.838 --> 01:21:52.673
Maude.

01:21:56.377 --> 01:21:57.942
Your sister was...

01:21:57.944 --> 01:21:59.213
I don't care.

01:22:04.585 --> 01:22:06.587
I'll see you down there.

01:22:08.788 --> 01:22:09.623
Okay.

01:23:45.252 --> 01:23:46.087
Darling.

01:23:51.759 --> 01:23:53.060
Happy birthday.

01:25:54.715 --> 01:25:55.949
Happy birthday.

01:26:03.423 --> 01:26:04.589
Hey.

01:26:04.591 --> 01:26:05.460
Hi.

01:26:06.627 --> 01:26:09.695
You were
beautiful tonight.

01:26:09.697 --> 01:26:10.698
Thank you.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:15.537
Keeping her won't
bring her back.

01:26:16.737 --> 01:26:17.639
You did it.

01:26:19.105 --> 01:26:19.940
Yes.

01:26:35.655 --> 01:26:37.388
What is it?

01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:39.893
Do you remember when we met?

01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:49.671
You wanted to take on the world.

01:26:50.637 --> 01:26:53.140
You told me to look after you,

01:26:55.141 --> 01:26:57.409
to keep you there,

01:26:57.411 --> 01:27:00.181
remind you of what
was important.

01:27:02.181 --> 01:27:03.251
I remember.

01:27:04.251 --> 01:27:06.487
This is important, Nelly.

01:27:07.554 --> 01:27:08.389
I know.

01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:11.960
- Do you?
- Of course.

01:27:19.632 --> 01:27:22.202
Lisbeth died a long time ago.

01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:24.271
You were a kid.

01:27:25.238 --> 01:27:27.040
It wasn't your fault.

01:27:28.207 --> 01:27:29.876
You were just a kid.

01:27:33.413 --> 01:27:34.446
So is she.

01:27:34.448 --> 01:27:35.283
Enough.

01:27:43.157 --> 01:27:43.992
Enough.

01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:14.675
It's
good to see you again.

01:30:15.641 --> 01:30:17.310
You're looking well.

01:30:23.783 --> 01:30:26.451
It was a great sacrifice.

01:30:26.453 --> 01:30:27.288
Thank you.

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:48.005
Just over a year ago,

01:30:48.007 --> 01:30:51.742
I was asked by this
council to find a twin.

01:30:51.744 --> 01:30:53.413
A very special twin.

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:58.785
With the ability to
communicate without speaking.

01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:01.422
I found her.

01:31:04.024 --> 01:31:05.857
As I said I would.

01:31:26.546 --> 01:31:30.717
This twin has indeed the DNA
we require for a perfect pair.

01:31:34.587 --> 01:31:37.257
The evidence appears undeniable.

01:31:42.962 --> 01:31:47.232
Her visions could have been
seen as merely random dreams.

01:31:47.234 --> 01:31:48.903
Premonitions, maybe.

01:31:51.003 --> 01:31:52.273
But not to her.

01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:05.717
What first started as a
mimicking of behaviour

01:32:05.719 --> 01:32:08.719
moved across the
spectrum of pain,

01:32:08.721 --> 01:32:10.254
suffering,

01:32:10.256 --> 01:32:11.324
and anxiety,

01:32:12.993 --> 01:32:16.731
to even a physical
manifestation of symptoms.

01:32:23.069 --> 01:32:26.340
One could bleed when
the other was cut.

01:32:30.143 --> 01:32:32.777
As we pushed the subject,

01:32:32.779 --> 01:32:34.515
her twin drew closer.

01:32:39.886 --> 01:32:42.123
Stage 4 was the final test.

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:46.060
Total crossover.

01:33:02.609 --> 01:33:05.744
She's gone, isn't she?

01:33:05.746 --> 01:33:07.748
For weeks now.

01:33:09.082 --> 01:33:11.352
I was in Germany.

01:33:13.252 --> 01:33:16.756
They've been doing
this for a long time.

01:33:18.824 --> 01:33:21.828
They just never got
this far before.

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:48.322
Did she know?

01:33:50.423 --> 01:33:52.926
Did she know that I loved her?

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.362
I did.

01:33:58.198 --> 01:34:01.965
I don't why I
rationed it sometimes.

01:34:01.967 --> 01:34:03.304
But I loved her.

01:34:14.314 --> 01:34:15.149
Ralph.

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:17.652
Ralph.

01:34:18.784 --> 01:34:22.920
Where's your brother?

01:35:37.096 --> 01:35:37.931
Help me.

01:35:39.365 --> 01:35:42.634
My theory was always that
the chosen twin, when found,

01:35:42.636 --> 01:35:46.807
would travel the exact same
path as the subject before her.

01:35:50.844 --> 01:35:53.210
But is there a guarantee?

01:35:58.484 --> 01:36:00.286
Is fate predetermined?

01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:09.930
Can we really lead others?

01:36:17.636 --> 01:36:20.940
Or do any of us really
know the answer?

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:34.986
Unlike this council, who believe

01:36:34.988 --> 01:36:38.392
that we can harness
and control thought,

01:36:41.528 --> 01:36:45.298
I now realise that we
may able to alter fate,

01:36:49.603 --> 01:36:51.501
but we can't escape it.

01:36:51.503 --> 01:36:52.640
Drop it.
