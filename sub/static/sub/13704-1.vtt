WEBVTT

01:00.660 --> 01:01.494
Hye-mi.

01:02.195 --> 01:03.263
Sam-dong.

01:19.145 --> 01:20.713
You really drive me nuts.

01:35.628 --> 01:36.563
Cut!

01:36.629 --> 01:38.064
Darn it. Retake!

01:39.065 --> 01:41.434
Gosh, where are the tears?

01:41.701 --> 01:43.436
How many times do we have to do this?

01:43.503 --> 01:45.839
We need tears. Is that a tall order?

01:48.775 --> 01:51.377
Put your emotions into the scene.

01:52.011 --> 01:54.347
-I'm sorry.
-Darn it. It's freezing.

01:54.414 --> 01:56.449
I'm sorry.

01:59.152 --> 02:00.854
Excuse me, sir.

02:00.920 --> 02:05.058
We're running way behind
with the rest of our schedule.

02:05.258 --> 02:07.427
Does Gwyneth Paltrow really use this?

02:08.094 --> 02:10.096
It stings.

02:11.531 --> 02:12.432
Why is it so cold?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.300
The shoot is being delayed

02:14.367 --> 02:16.202
-because she can't act.
-Oh, gosh.

02:16.503 --> 02:17.937
This is the last scene.

02:18.004 --> 02:20.039
-If she works harder--
-I'm sorry.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.075
-What are you doing?
-Let's go.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.410
I'll never work with a teen idol again.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.812
-I'm sorry.
-I can't believe this.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.447
-Don't we have some time?
-Hey!

02:27.514 --> 02:29.315
We won't be able to get you
to your next appearance.

02:29.382 --> 02:30.583
I can nail it in one more take.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.153
You did well, so let's go. Hurry up.

02:41.561 --> 02:44.764
You can put us later in the lineup
or switch us with another group.

02:45.131 --> 02:47.300
We've never been that punctual anyway.

02:47.567 --> 02:51.404
SUCPA went into effect today.
You need to get on stage now.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.573
SUCPA went into effect today?

02:55.775 --> 02:58.678
It didn't work during the shoot.
Why am I welling up now?

02:59.579 --> 03:00.580
This stuff stings.

03:04.751 --> 03:08.021
The Special Underage Celebrity
Protection Act went into effect today.

03:08.087 --> 03:10.924
Underage celebrities must now attend
at least 20 hours of school per week

03:10.990 --> 03:13.293
and are banned from working
after 10:00 p.m.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.895
SUCPA has triggered heated debate.

03:15.962 --> 03:19.566
Down with SUCPA!
Down with a law that destroys teen idols!

03:19.632 --> 03:21.501
-Down with SUCPA!
-Down with SUCPA!

03:21.568 --> 03:24.304
I'm in front of a venue
where a K-pop concert is being held.

03:24.404 --> 03:26.839
-Young students against SUCPA
-We oppose SUCPA.

03:26.906 --> 03:29.542
-have organized a large-scale protest--
-The stage is where singers belong.

03:30.176 --> 03:31.144
WE OPPOSE SUCPA

03:31.211 --> 03:33.780
The stage is where singers belong.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.481
-They belong on stage.
-They belong on stage.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.350
We oppose SUCPA.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.752
-We oppose SUCPA.
-We oppose SUCPA.

03:52.665 --> 03:53.633
What's the matter with you?

04:04.310 --> 04:07.180
Are you saying that you're going
to take them out of the lineup?

04:07.780 --> 04:09.349
It's 9:30 p.m.

04:09.882 --> 04:11.818
They're not even in the building yet.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.486
I just talked to them on the phone.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.322
They say they can see the 63 Building,
which has to mean they'll get here soon.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.257
That's what you said half an hour ago.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.762
You should've taken the first slot
like the producer told you to.

04:24.697 --> 04:25.798
You should know better.

04:26.899 --> 04:29.102
Not even a newbie does the opening act.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.870
We're talking about
the comeback performance

04:30.937 --> 04:32.672
of Oz Entertainment's I:dn.

04:33.506 --> 04:35.074
How can they possibly go first?

04:35.608 --> 04:36.643
You should know better.

04:36.709 --> 04:37.877
So, what are you suggesting?

04:38.711 --> 04:40.880
Let's say we drag things out
and get them on stage.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.049
Are you suggesting us
dragging them off the stage

04:43.116 --> 04:44.517
as soon as the clock strikes 10:00 p.m.?

04:44.817 --> 04:46.486
HershE, be on standby.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.455
I'm busy right now. Later, okay?

04:50.690 --> 04:51.724
It's almost 10:00 p.m.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.559
Get all underage singers
out of the dressing rooms.

04:53.626 --> 04:54.460
Okay.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.131
Mr. Lee,

04:59.165 --> 05:01.768
Producer Shin is going up against us.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.670
The network folks aren't even a fun match.

05:04.437 --> 05:05.705
You still haven't heard from Si-u?

05:07.273 --> 05:09.609
Tell him we're going to take our leave
if he keeps antagonizing us.

05:09.909 --> 05:12.178
How will the network
have a music show without Oz?

05:14.580 --> 05:16.616
I'm hanging up. All this talking
is only making me hungry.

05:22.855 --> 05:23.723
Let's go eat.

05:26.092 --> 05:27.593
I have to go on stage today.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.162
Si-u will be here soon.

05:29.362 --> 05:30.730
It will be too late.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.799
Even Cinderella had until midnight.

05:33.466 --> 05:35.601
How can they expect us not to work
after 10:00 p.m.?

05:36.703 --> 05:40.273
What's the point in working out
and getting a beastly body?

05:40.707 --> 05:42.642
A 10:00 p.m. curfew does take away from
the beastliness.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.044
If a man had to run home
at 10:00 p.m. in the middle of a date,

05:45.345 --> 05:46.446
who would find him attractive?

05:47.447 --> 05:49.782
We're idols. Teenagers look up to us.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.385
We shouldn't have to leave
the stage at 10:00 p.m.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.289
You're too cute.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.159
I get your point, but listen carefully.

06:01.260 --> 06:04.464
Let's say you ignore the law
and take the stage at 10:00 p.m.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.598
You would look cool.

06:06.532 --> 06:09.035
But you won't be able to work at all
for three months,

06:09.435 --> 06:11.104
and the network will suffer penalties.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.507
The network folks will get mad
and refuse to work with our singers.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.075
Will you take responsibility for all that?

06:20.079 --> 06:27.086
-I:dn!
-HershE!

06:27.653 --> 06:34.660
-I:dn!
-HershE!

06:34.727 --> 06:36.829
-I:dn!
-Who asked you for an encore?

06:36.896 --> 06:39.465
Where's I:dn?
Why is HershE on stage again?

06:39.532 --> 06:41.834
-Get off the stage!
-HershE!

06:41.901 --> 06:44.103
-HershE!
-HershE!

06:52.478 --> 06:54.080
-HershE!
-Where are you going?

06:54.147 --> 06:55.314
It's too late.

06:55.381 --> 06:57.617
They won't be able to perform today.
I'm off.

07:00.386 --> 07:01.454
HERSHE MAKES MY HERAT FLUTTER

07:25.077 --> 07:26.712
PERFECT GIRL, RIAN

07:44.464 --> 07:45.465
Hello.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.103
What are you doing?

07:51.704 --> 07:54.507
-There was something in your hair.
-I see.

07:54.574 --> 07:55.408
Yes.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.144
Excuse me.

08:58.237 --> 09:02.708
-HershE!
-HershE!

09:02.775 --> 09:03.943
Thank you.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.612
-Are you mad at me?
-Is this a joke to you?

09:06.679 --> 09:07.813
Thank you.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.216
Something came up.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.553
-Another girl problem?
-No.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.322
-Gosh.
-How can you be smiling right now?

09:17.924 --> 09:20.593
This is why I was late.
Let's talk after you listen to this.

09:33.205 --> 09:34.807
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

09:34.874 --> 09:37.043
I know you went to Kirin Art School.
I'm a student there.

09:37.109 --> 09:37.944
I see.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.713
-May I have your autograph?
-Sure.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.983
-What's your name?
-It's Shin Hae-seong.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.918
-So you go to Kirin Art School?
-Yes.

09:45.985 --> 09:47.253
TO HAE-SEONG

09:48.521 --> 09:50.723
-Here you go. Keep up the good work.
-Okay.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.659
Thank you. Take care!

10:21.654 --> 10:22.989
I... I love you.

10:24.991 --> 10:25.891
What?

10:30.563 --> 10:31.764
I love you as a fan.

10:32.264 --> 10:34.200
Oh, okay.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.636
JB! I'M YOURS!

10:43.609 --> 10:45.144
Do you think Mr. Lee's on to us?

10:46.212 --> 10:47.113
Will this be okay?

10:59.458 --> 11:00.793
I love you, too.

11:04.296 --> 11:05.665
I have a favor to ask you.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.334
What is it?

11:23.215 --> 11:25.184
Hey! Get up!

11:27.687 --> 11:28.721
You're underage, right?

11:28.988 --> 11:31.057
-After 10:00 p.m., you--
-I almost slept through it.

11:33.325 --> 11:34.560
A mob of fans is coming this way.

11:35.594 --> 11:37.863
I support one of your singers.
The fans are coming!

11:38.698 --> 11:40.466
-Hey.
-They're threatening to kill you

11:40.533 --> 11:42.968
-because I:dn didn't take the stage today.
-I don't mind being killed.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.771
Wait, the I:dn members are safe.
You should stay here for your safety.

11:45.838 --> 11:48.107
-I said that I'm--
-I'm sorry.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.580
Our time with Korea's top ten
girl groups and boy bands

11:54.647 --> 11:56.282
-is winding to a close.
-I:dn!

11:56.348 --> 11:58.250
-It's the 2012 K-Pop Festival!
-I:dn!

11:58.617 --> 12:01.387
-I think it's over.
-The show will have to end for today.

12:01.654 --> 12:05.124
-Did you all have a good time?
-Yes.

12:06.625 --> 12:10.062
We hope to bring you
even greater performances next time.

12:10.129 --> 12:11.397
I will say goodbye...

12:13.466 --> 12:14.567
What's going on?

12:15.201 --> 12:17.002
Camera three, pan to the audience.

12:17.436 --> 12:19.004
All right. Cut.

12:19.638 --> 12:20.840
Damn it.

12:21.640 --> 12:22.808
How long until we're off air?

12:26.846 --> 12:28.914
Open the door. Hey!

12:29.782 --> 12:31.383
The press is on their way.

12:31.450 --> 12:34.420
The security guards and managers
are keeping the fans at bay.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.321
I'm so sorry.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.164
What are you doing here?
It's past 10:00 p.m.

12:45.231 --> 12:46.699
What? Already?

12:50.136 --> 12:52.371
-Then what are they doing here?
-Never mind. Look forward.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.277
Shit!

15:17.449 --> 15:19.919
-Are you having fun?
-Yes!

15:19.985 --> 15:21.787
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

15:21.854 --> 15:23.722
-Do you want to party?
-Yes!

15:23.789 --> 15:25.157
Let's party!

15:28.060 --> 15:28.894
Hold on.

15:29.695 --> 15:30.863
May I see your ID, please?

15:31.730 --> 15:32.564
Why?

15:33.565 --> 15:34.600
Aren't you underage?

15:35.567 --> 15:36.468
Me?

15:38.037 --> 15:39.571
I must look young.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.607
As per the Special Underage
Celebrity Protection Act,

15:41.674 --> 15:44.310
street performances by underage performers
are also banned.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.678
We ask for your cooperation.

15:47.012 --> 15:50.382
We're not celebrities. We're artists.

15:51.216 --> 15:52.051
Right?

15:52.251 --> 15:54.820
Just show him your ID.
You're making the audience wait.

15:55.654 --> 15:56.555
Please show us your ID.

15:57.489 --> 15:59.858
Let me go and get my wallet.

16:16.175 --> 16:18.010
You must be out of your mind.

16:20.446 --> 16:21.547
Why did you go on stage again?

16:22.114 --> 16:25.317
I had dozed off and got confused.

16:25.384 --> 16:26.418
I see.

16:26.485 --> 16:30.289
So you had dozed off
and didn't know it was past 10:00 p.m.?

16:31.056 --> 16:33.559
If we let an underage kid like you
be part of our group,

16:33.625 --> 16:35.361
the least you could do

16:35.694 --> 16:37.529
was stay low at a time like this.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.098
Gosh, this kid...

16:45.170 --> 16:46.338
Where do you think you're going?

16:49.441 --> 16:52.344
I can't take this anymore.

16:52.411 --> 16:53.479
Hey, look.

16:53.645 --> 16:56.915
Did you let me join the group
out of sincere generosity?

16:57.483 --> 16:58.484
No.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.054
You did it
because I'm the best dancer around.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.690
No one's as good as me.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.558
-Have you lost your mind?
-Yes!

17:07.192 --> 17:08.327
Yes, I've lost my mind.

17:09.461 --> 17:13.031
Do you think I have nowhere else to go?
I can leave right now.

17:18.270 --> 17:19.471
Why did you do it?

17:20.172 --> 17:21.440
It was on purpose, wasn't it?

17:22.107 --> 17:25.911
Why didn't you take the stage alone?
Why drag me into your mess?

17:27.346 --> 17:30.682
Since I got the boot thanks to you,
let me say a few more words.

17:31.517 --> 17:35.821
Skipping meals and not getting any sleep
to follow you around

17:36.789 --> 17:38.557
hasn't done me any good.

17:39.992 --> 17:42.161
You think you're just
the hottest thing there is.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.663
And you disappear
whenever you feel like it.

17:45.597 --> 17:47.900
You two have some growing up to do.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.034
Do you know that?

17:54.840 --> 17:58.844
I know where you're coming from,
but we only did what he had to do.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.713
-You think you're making any sense?
-What are you doing here?

18:01.780 --> 18:03.182
-I'm sorry.
-Hang on.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.584
-I'm sorry.
-I'm not finished yet.

18:05.884 --> 18:07.386
-Hey! Come back here.
-That's enough.

18:07.519 --> 18:09.154
-Let go!
-Stop.

18:09.521 --> 18:10.489
Those bastards...

18:10.756 --> 18:14.226
I had no idea a nerd like you
would cause a major blow-up like this.

18:16.695 --> 18:17.963
Where did you get the song?

18:19.965 --> 18:22.000
From my new informant.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.036
Who's the girl this time?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.604
It's not like that.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.739
It's totally platonic.

18:30.976 --> 18:32.211
When will you grow up?

18:36.148 --> 18:37.483
Jeez.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.319
You're not taking me
to the police, are you?

18:40.385 --> 18:41.954
It won't happen again.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.790
My parents will kill me if they find out.
I'm not going anywhere.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.925
No, never.

18:50.329 --> 18:51.797
I almost got myself in trouble.

19:03.509 --> 19:04.543
Hey, Jeong Ui-bong.

19:05.244 --> 19:06.145
Darn it.

19:07.679 --> 19:09.281
That traitor.

19:15.587 --> 19:16.588
Where is she going?

19:36.842 --> 19:38.143
Hey, where did you get the key?

19:46.852 --> 19:47.853
Hey, you--

19:51.323 --> 19:52.291
Who's there?

19:56.828 --> 19:59.431
KIRIN ART SCHOOL

20:23.455 --> 20:25.123
Why were you late this time?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.296
-This is why I was late.
-Put that away.

20:31.363 --> 20:34.333
If you let anyone else see it,
it won't bring you luck.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.835
It'll be nothing more
than just a mere piece of paper.

20:36.902 --> 20:37.769
Really?

20:43.709 --> 20:46.445
Here's the tap water
from Oz Entertainment.

20:46.511 --> 20:47.379
Take it.

20:47.846 --> 20:50.816
Burn the talismans,
add the ashes to the water, and drink it.

20:51.650 --> 20:54.319
-Drink it?
-What does she have to drink?

20:57.823 --> 20:58.724
CURFEW VIOLATOR

20:58.857 --> 21:00.525
You're always getting into trouble.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.128
"Curfew violator"?

21:03.829 --> 21:05.464
Where were you this time?

21:06.064 --> 21:06.965
At a concert.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.034
At a concert?

21:09.568 --> 21:11.570
-For the music.
-For the music?

21:11.703 --> 21:13.972
-That's educational, too.
-Right.

21:14.539 --> 21:16.208
Didn't you go there
just to gawk at the singers?

21:17.876 --> 21:18.844
Hey, Shaman.

21:19.778 --> 21:20.846
You're not going anywhere.

21:21.747 --> 21:22.681
Sun-dong.

21:23.548 --> 21:25.550
If you keep making other kids
pay for your hocus-pocus,

21:25.617 --> 21:28.053
I'm reporting you to the police for fraud.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.554
-When did I--
-Go.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.256
Get out of here.

21:32.324 --> 21:33.492
Bye.

21:37.696 --> 21:38.563
What's this?

21:42.901 --> 21:44.903
Judging from the size,
it has to be Mr. Yang Jin-man's.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.471
-Am I right?
-Yes.

21:47.506 --> 21:53.011
So he's making you shine his shoes
because you broke the curfew?

21:53.478 --> 21:54.346
Yes.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.817
Good grief. That Mr. Yang...

22:01.019 --> 22:02.921
These are a bit big for me.

22:06.558 --> 22:07.626
Shine mine too.

22:22.541 --> 22:23.642
Why am I down here?

22:28.113 --> 22:28.947
Hey!

22:29.314 --> 22:31.016
What are you doing here?

22:31.750 --> 22:32.718
Come on, Mr. Yang.

22:33.051 --> 22:34.119
What's going on?

22:34.386 --> 22:35.921
Why are you sleeping in my room?

22:36.421 --> 22:38.724
-Why?
-I had nowhere else to sleep.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.692
What about your dorm room?
But it's my bed...

22:42.294 --> 22:43.261
It's 9:30 a.m.

22:43.662 --> 22:44.663
I'm late.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.734
I set the alarm back a bit.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.102
Why?

22:52.270 --> 22:54.506
I told you, didn't I?

22:55.273 --> 22:56.608
You can eat whatever you want,

22:58.310 --> 23:00.078
but not bananas.

23:00.846 --> 23:02.948
I'm telling you, people make fun of you
behind your back.

23:03.014 --> 23:05.150
Why did you set my alarm back?

23:18.130 --> 23:19.097
One, two.

23:24.870 --> 23:26.004
Stop.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.675
Expand the diaphragm

23:31.243 --> 23:34.279
and raise the muscles
of the pelvis and buttocks

23:34.746 --> 23:37.449
to let the air into your lungs.

23:40.085 --> 23:43.255
Fill up your lungs.

23:43.522 --> 23:45.857
-What is she babbling about?
-Be quiet.

23:46.324 --> 23:50.328
Make your diaphragm and spine
almost touch each other.

23:50.395 --> 23:52.230
Her old diaphragm talk...

23:52.864 --> 23:57.469
Have the diaphragm push up
against the entire surface of the abdomen.

23:57.769 --> 24:00.138
Focus on your voice.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.075
We'll take it from the top.

24:13.919 --> 24:15.487
Stop.

24:17.522 --> 24:21.226
I make it so simple for you.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.094
Why don't you get it?

24:24.196 --> 24:26.031
I'm sorry.

24:27.032 --> 24:29.668
Don't be sorry.
It's not like this is the first time.

24:31.736 --> 24:32.838
Should I get a pail?

24:33.672 --> 24:37.275
You know that your original compositions
are due tonight, right?

24:38.310 --> 24:39.978
-Yes.
-Yes.

24:49.221 --> 24:50.088
What are these?

24:50.155 --> 24:51.723
S-grade is 30,000 won,
A-grade is 20,000 won,

24:51.790 --> 24:53.091
and the rest are 10,000 won.

24:53.892 --> 24:55.494
That's 10,000 won.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.762
Hang on.

24:59.064 --> 25:00.332
I want an S-grade one.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.767
The quality is guaranteed, right?

25:04.035 --> 25:05.370
Don't you trust me?

25:06.538 --> 25:08.006
Of course, I do.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.109
-Me too.
-Me too.

25:11.776 --> 25:14.112
HOW TO WRITE ENSEMBLE ARRANGEMENTS

25:18.083 --> 25:19.518
Slow down a bit, will you?

25:20.318 --> 25:21.386
Yu-jin!

25:23.221 --> 25:25.156
You still have the original composition
CDs left, right?

25:25.223 --> 25:26.892
Yes, you're on top of the last couple.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.194
How about a buy-one-get-one-free deal?

25:29.261 --> 25:31.296
I need another one
for the next assignment.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.099
-My works are worth more than that.
-I was just kidding.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.369
-It's JB.
-It's JB.

25:37.435 --> 25:38.436
-Really?
-For real?

25:47.546 --> 25:50.315
Keeping our promise with the fans
was more important than the law.

25:51.449 --> 25:53.652
Our fans had been waiting so long
for our comeback performance.

25:54.019 --> 25:55.387
We couldn't let them down.

25:55.687 --> 25:57.389
-Oh, my.
-We're sorry

25:57.455 --> 25:59.424
-for causing trouble.
-Did the networks ban them?

25:59.491 --> 26:01.626
-We will face the consequences.
-Probably.

26:10.535 --> 26:11.803
I love you, too.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.015
He's the reason I lost
my backup dancing gig.

26:24.082 --> 26:24.983
You got the ax?

26:25.717 --> 26:26.551
Yes.

26:27.285 --> 26:30.288
The law is meant to protect those jerks,
but it only hurts artists like us.

26:30.455 --> 26:31.590
Does this make any sense to you?

26:31.890 --> 26:33.391
How can art be constrained by curfews?

26:33.758 --> 26:35.160
Hey, artist.

26:38.363 --> 26:40.899
If you're so principled,
why did you run away?

26:43.668 --> 26:44.869
How did I know?

26:46.037 --> 26:47.973
-Because I called the cops.
-What?

26:48.273 --> 26:50.642
You were making noise on the street.
Someone had to stop you.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.878
Observe the law, will you? SUCPA.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.948
"A law is a law,
however undesirable it may be."

26:57.015 --> 26:58.049
Socrates said so.

26:58.416 --> 27:00.018
-"Socrates"?
-Never heard of that, have you?

27:00.518 --> 27:02.921
You're so ignorant, you twit.

27:03.688 --> 27:05.256
I knew the quote.

27:07.425 --> 27:09.561
Did you hear him call me a twit?

27:09.961 --> 27:10.795
Yes.

27:19.404 --> 27:20.472
JB IS THE BEST

27:20.538 --> 27:22.941
YOUR EYES ARE MESMERIZING.
I LOVE YOU.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.344
I:DN ROCKS
JB IS THE BEST

27:34.252 --> 27:36.955
-I:dn's the best!
-I:dn's the best!

27:37.589 --> 27:39.057
-I:dn's the best!
-I:dn's the best!

27:39.190 --> 27:42.427
I will kill him
and return to the government office.

27:43.928 --> 27:45.797
Teaching me martial arts
was what I asked of you

27:46.765 --> 27:48.867
so that I could protect the one
I longed to protect

27:50.201 --> 27:52.737
and destroy the one I sought to destroy.

27:55.206 --> 27:56.074
But...

27:56.908 --> 27:58.777
it's all over now.

28:00.612 --> 28:02.147
I have no reason to live anymore.

28:04.215 --> 28:08.253
I must meet Min Song-baek
and seek my revenge on him!

28:15.527 --> 28:17.429
What did Min Song-baek do so wrong?

28:20.165 --> 28:21.399
He's played by So Ji-sub.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.535
Work on your acting.

28:23.601 --> 28:27.038
I bet So Ji-sub would not be able to
kill you if he saw your bad acting.

28:28.273 --> 28:29.107
Hey!

28:29.708 --> 28:32.143
Who are you to criticize my acting?

28:32.744 --> 28:34.412
-Hey!
-Hang on.

28:35.113 --> 28:36.347
Jeez.

28:37.282 --> 28:39.684
What are you doing with a sword
in the rehearsal studio?

28:44.055 --> 28:45.023
JB.

28:46.024 --> 28:47.625
You got yourself into a fine mess.

28:49.594 --> 28:50.862
Mr. Lee wants to see you.

29:01.740 --> 29:02.741
I'll come with you.

29:04.275 --> 29:05.243
There's no need.

29:11.616 --> 29:13.885
We're sorry about what happened,

29:15.019 --> 29:16.755
but it was only I:dn
that broke the curfew.

29:16.821 --> 29:21.025
Why should other artists from Oz
be reprimanded as well?

29:23.528 --> 29:26.197
You are targeting
an entire entertainment agency...

29:26.931 --> 29:27.766
Ridiculous.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.970
Have it your way. Don't have any
of my artists perform for your network.

29:32.737 --> 29:33.638
Three months?

29:34.205 --> 29:35.673
No, for good.

29:36.074 --> 29:37.609
Very well.

29:40.411 --> 29:43.982
KBC won't let any Oz entertainers
appear on their network.

29:46.785 --> 29:47.752
It's all because of you.

29:48.686 --> 29:49.721
I'm sorry.

29:54.058 --> 29:56.227
This is maddening.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.466
Explain yourself to me.

30:02.667 --> 30:05.970
Our single was plagiarized, Mr. Lee.

30:06.404 --> 30:09.874
Says who? Why is it that every release
gets embroiled in a plagiarism scandal?

30:15.046 --> 30:15.980
Check this out.

30:17.448 --> 30:18.483
Are you sure?

30:19.150 --> 30:21.486
There were talks of plagiarism
about our last album, and now...

30:22.320 --> 30:23.688
You saw how I came out on top.

30:24.455 --> 30:25.824
I never lose.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.625
This isn't about winning or losing.

30:28.593 --> 30:31.963
We can't go on if we keep
getting caught up in scandals.

30:33.598 --> 30:36.367
-For the sake of Oz--
-Just be honest.

30:38.803 --> 30:40.805
I also needed time.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.210
I want some time to work on things alone.

30:46.477 --> 30:48.746
I'm getting tired of wasting time

30:49.714 --> 30:50.915
cleaning up Si-u's mess.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.018
Just because he was a trainee
for eight years,

30:54.085 --> 30:55.153
he can't do whatever he wants.

30:57.021 --> 31:00.191
I want to make and sing real music.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.361
I promise you I will work hard.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.497
Let me go solo, Mr. Lee.

31:10.768 --> 31:15.540
So, you set off a bomb
because you wanted to go solo?

31:16.207 --> 31:17.742
We can't keep performing
a plagiarized song.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.143
Stop saying it's plagiarized.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.182
You're ready to work very hard, right?

31:24.449 --> 31:25.283
Yes.

31:26.351 --> 31:27.785
Solo or group,

31:29.053 --> 31:30.154
I'm only giving you six months.

31:30.755 --> 31:32.523
A year is too long. Understood?

31:45.603 --> 31:48.072
You said we would go up against him
using the plagiarized single.

31:50.074 --> 31:51.676
I thought that's what we were doing.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.745
Whatever the reason,
it all comes out the same.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.213
How is it the same?

31:55.947 --> 31:59.951
Since you wanted to go solo
and have time to practice,

32:00.285 --> 32:02.654
you tricked us
and made me play second fiddle.

32:02.720 --> 32:07.125
You should be grateful
that I even let you play second fiddle.

32:13.164 --> 32:15.266
You didn't have to drag HershE into this.

32:15.967 --> 32:17.769
Don't you think you're being too selfish?

32:17.835 --> 32:18.703
Selfish?

32:20.338 --> 32:22.440
And since when have you been so selfless?

32:23.641 --> 32:25.944
You wouldn't be here now
if you weren't selfish yourself.

32:37.388 --> 32:38.289
What's going on?

32:39.490 --> 32:40.758
Why are you two so serious?

32:43.428 --> 32:44.362
I'm sorry.

32:45.129 --> 32:47.598
Everyone at Oz is banned
from the networks because of us.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.602
Banned from the networks?

32:54.505 --> 32:55.773
Really?

32:59.110 --> 33:00.178
Are you okay?

33:00.511 --> 33:02.113
Of course, I'm okay.

33:02.613 --> 33:05.616
It's been so hard trying to juggle
both the TV drama

33:05.683 --> 33:07.352
and music schedules.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.622
I'm pretty pleased with you guys.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.401
Let me do that.

33:29.540 --> 33:30.375
What?

33:30.775 --> 33:31.909
You're in high school, right?

33:33.077 --> 33:33.911
Me?

33:34.512 --> 33:36.814
-Give me a break.
-Show us your ID.

33:37.782 --> 33:40.685
I don't carry that around.
I'm a free spirit.

33:41.552 --> 33:43.654
You did a good job,

33:44.188 --> 33:45.490
taking us for a ride.

33:45.990 --> 33:48.693
We're all musicians here.
Who cares about age?

33:48.760 --> 33:51.362
We speak the language of music, you know.
That's the rock spirit, right?

33:51.562 --> 33:53.498
Get lost, kiddo.

33:53.798 --> 33:55.333
You'll only disrupt our performance.

33:55.500 --> 33:59.337
A rock band needs at least three members.

33:59.670 --> 34:01.172
We won't be using a guest member anymore.

34:01.472 --> 34:04.842
You can't trust anyone these days.
The two of us can manage.

34:07.378 --> 34:09.881
People are talking
because you two are always together.

34:13.918 --> 34:15.186
Hey, Yu-jin.

34:15.553 --> 34:16.554
Jin Yu-jin!

34:19.957 --> 34:22.960
It's almost 10:00 p.m.
Shouldn't you be getting back to school?

34:23.761 --> 34:24.896
My gosh.

34:26.664 --> 34:28.466
Do you run a fried chicken joint?

34:29.634 --> 34:31.502
Yes. So?

34:32.103 --> 34:35.139
Don't change the subject.
Do you want a ride to your dorm?

34:35.773 --> 34:36.908
No thanks.

34:40.278 --> 34:41.345
TO HAE-SEONG

34:44.615 --> 34:46.117
You're all set here.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.618
I'll wait outside.

34:50.088 --> 34:50.922
What?

34:51.556 --> 34:53.291
Can't you stay here with me?

34:53.691 --> 34:55.726
No one else should see you
performing the ritual.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.062
Good luck.

34:58.763 --> 34:59.597
Thanks.

35:04.702 --> 35:06.504
Spirits used to be human,

35:07.205 --> 35:09.173
so I bet they'll fall for a hot chick.

35:09.574 --> 35:12.143
Be sexy. Be alluring.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.929
Let me pass the Oz Entertainment audition

35:32.630 --> 35:33.798
with the highest score.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.705
Add the ashes of the talismans
to the water and drink it.

35:41.072 --> 35:42.039
You can do it.

35:53.184 --> 35:55.720
What a pain. It's so cold.

35:56.587 --> 35:59.056
Why are you always out late?
You're wearing me out.

35:59.423 --> 36:00.258
Come on.

36:01.425 --> 36:03.628
-We're best buds, aren't we?
-My gosh.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.590
Ui-bong, wake everyone up.

36:32.657 --> 36:33.591
-There's a fire!
-A fire?

36:33.658 --> 36:34.792
Okay.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.161
Fire!

36:37.595 --> 36:38.663
Is anyone in there?

36:38.963 --> 36:39.997
Hello?

36:40.898 --> 36:42.934
Why is he overreacting?

36:43.401 --> 36:44.335
Oh, gosh.

36:49.907 --> 36:50.908
What should I do?

36:54.512 --> 36:56.914
-No one can see the talismans.
-There's a fire.

36:56.981 --> 36:58.849
-Come on, please burn quickly.
-Call for help!

36:58.916 --> 37:00.585
No, it went out again.

37:08.492 --> 37:10.328
Is anyone in there? Answer me.

37:10.795 --> 37:11.729
Mr. Yang, here!

37:12.129 --> 37:13.331
But it's here...

37:14.832 --> 37:16.634
-There's a fire!
-Fire!

37:21.606 --> 37:23.107
-Fire!
-Fire!

37:23.641 --> 37:24.542
What's going on?

37:25.710 --> 37:26.577
Fire!

37:36.153 --> 37:38.522
-What are you looking at?
-Pervert.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.092
Mr. Yang, Hae-seong's in the room.

37:41.158 --> 37:42.593
-She must have passed out.
-What?

37:42.727 --> 37:44.662
-What do we do?
-Call the fire department.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.298
-Call 911!
-No, Mr. Yang.

37:47.365 --> 37:49.166
-No?
-Aren't you going to rescue her?

37:49.567 --> 37:50.401
Me?

37:53.771 --> 37:55.006
Am I going to die like this?

37:55.473 --> 37:59.076
I've never been in a proper relationship,
nor have I made my debut as a singer.

37:59.677 --> 38:00.711
Hey, wait a minute.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.414
What are you doing? Hey.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.316
-Hurry!
-What?

38:06.117 --> 38:07.184
Open the door!

38:07.251 --> 38:09.253
You have to stay alert. Don't fall asleep.

38:10.087 --> 38:11.055
I'll help you.

38:11.355 --> 38:12.290
Darn it.

38:12.757 --> 38:14.525
Just this one time. Please.

38:14.859 --> 38:16.527
I won't bother you again. I'm sorry.

38:16.927 --> 38:17.862
Oh, boy.

38:18.462 --> 38:19.730
-Hurry, guys.
-Sir.

38:19.797 --> 38:20.765
-Come on!
-Run!

38:20.831 --> 38:23.301
-Hurry!
-This way.

38:25.236 --> 38:27.204
-Come on!
-Hurry up and open the door.

38:27.271 --> 38:28.973
Just one more. Burn!

38:30.408 --> 38:31.809
What?

38:31.876 --> 38:34.178
Why doesn't this thing burn?

38:34.545 --> 38:35.546
Oh, no.

38:40.117 --> 38:43.020
-Stop yelling.
-Do something, Mr. Yang.

38:43.087 --> 38:44.188
Come on.

38:50.027 --> 38:52.330
No!

38:53.597 --> 38:56.734
No!

39:05.509 --> 39:07.278
-What's going on?
-What's wrong with her?

39:07.445 --> 39:09.680
-Just look at her.
-What is all that?

39:20.591 --> 39:22.460
I'm so embarrassed.

39:29.066 --> 39:29.900
I'm cold.

39:30.167 --> 39:33.137
Did you really believe her?

39:36.006 --> 39:37.541
I have a bad feeling.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.578
What if I jinxed myself?

39:41.312 --> 39:43.614
Don't say that.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.216
You'll anger the spirits.

39:45.883 --> 39:46.717
Zip it.

39:48.519 --> 39:49.954
She's a total scam.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.391
She's fooled you so many times.
How can you still fall for it?

39:54.158 --> 39:56.160
What if you really caused a fire?

39:56.227 --> 39:57.461
What fire?

39:57.528 --> 40:00.231
I was just trying to burn some paper
to drink the ashes with water.

40:01.432 --> 40:04.668
Not following through
is worse than not having started at all.

40:05.169 --> 40:08.239
Gosh, they ruined a done deal.

40:11.208 --> 40:14.378
I went through so much
to get those autograph talismans.

40:15.513 --> 40:16.947
If I were you,

40:17.014 --> 40:18.749
I would have used
that time to practice more.

40:19.216 --> 40:21.285
I work so hard,
but I just can't pass the audition.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.221
If I don't make it this time,

40:24.955 --> 40:26.957
my dad might come and drag me back home.

40:27.892 --> 40:29.126
Don't worry.

40:29.493 --> 40:31.128
There's one last thing you can try.

40:31.195 --> 40:32.096
And that is...

40:38.436 --> 40:39.403
I'll help you

40:40.905 --> 40:42.106
make your wish come true.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.241
How?

41:47.638 --> 41:48.939
OZ OPEN CALL

41:58.983 --> 42:01.118
Numbers 15, 16, and 19, come in.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.019
-Okay.
-Coming.

42:03.587 --> 42:06.590
I'm Shin Hae-seong, number 18.
You didn't call my number.

42:06.657 --> 42:08.592
Starting today,
we're not accepting minors.

42:08.959 --> 42:09.793
What?

42:10.995 --> 42:12.396
Is it because of SUCPA?

42:12.463 --> 42:15.933
I'll be of age in a year.
I could train for a year.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.134
Who's she?

42:19.737 --> 42:21.305
I'm a great singer.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.439
I can do just about everything

42:22.506 --> 42:24.241
except Mariah Carey's
dolphin-like high notes.

42:24.508 --> 42:26.544
I've practiced my heart out.

42:26.777 --> 42:28.379
Without protecting your vocal cords?

42:29.513 --> 42:32.216
Screaming is unpleasant to the ears.

42:33.951 --> 42:35.586
You audition every month.

42:37.021 --> 42:41.458
You must be confusing me
with someone else.

42:41.892 --> 42:43.060
I'm quite good.

42:43.260 --> 42:44.395
Go to a karaoke box.

42:45.629 --> 42:47.631
There are plenty
who are quite good as you.

42:49.233 --> 42:52.836
Your singing lacks emotional sincerity.
All you do is embellish.

42:52.903 --> 42:55.172
You have no sense of rhythm,
your pitch is worrisome,

42:55.239 --> 42:56.907
and your tone is mediocre.

42:56.974 --> 43:00.044
You always say you can do everything
but hit the dolphin-like high notes.

43:01.445 --> 43:04.048
At your level, you won't make it
anywhere else either.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.151
If there's an agency willing to take you,

43:07.217 --> 43:10.421
they'll say they need money from you
to make you into a singer.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.590
That's fraud.

43:19.863 --> 43:23.734
I don't think you remember my singing.

43:25.202 --> 43:29.006
I don't think you remember my name either,
so let me remind you.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.575
My name is Shin Hae-seong.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.812
"Hae" means "ocean." "Seong" means "star."

43:35.379 --> 43:36.780
I'm a star hidden in the ocean.

43:39.450 --> 43:42.052
Make sure you don't forget my name
this time around.

43:43.087 --> 43:44.955
I may be a mere starfish right now,

43:45.456 --> 43:47.524
but I'll make my way
up to the sky one day.

43:49.093 --> 43:50.995
And you'll regret all the nasty things

43:51.862 --> 43:53.330
you said to me today.

44:10.447 --> 44:11.782
I'm better than all of you.

44:12.616 --> 44:13.751
Much better.

44:15.619 --> 44:17.321
I just haven't gotten my lucky break yet.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.829
There's no age restriction for this.

44:31.301 --> 44:32.269
Yes, Dad.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.108
What do you think, Ms. Hyeon?

44:39.910 --> 44:43.947
Kirin is the only
accredited arts high school in Seoul.

44:44.281 --> 44:46.817
If they go to Kirin,
at least we won't have to worry about

44:46.884 --> 44:49.486
the stipulation
of 20 class hours per week.

44:49.620 --> 44:51.155
I think this is an opportunity.

44:52.389 --> 44:53.624
I heard other agencies

44:53.691 --> 44:56.560
plan to transfer their kids
to Kirin Art School.

44:57.661 --> 45:00.764
The mandatory 20 class hours per week
is a real headache,

45:00.831 --> 45:02.199
but as long as they go to that school,

45:02.266 --> 45:04.401
it will be dealt with
and they can perform overseas.

45:06.136 --> 45:07.905
Under the circumstances,
we cannot ask for more.

45:08.772 --> 45:10.741
So what's holding you back?

45:11.341 --> 45:13.377
But why Kirin?

45:13.744 --> 45:15.746
They're living off their past glory.

45:16.613 --> 45:19.016
Is that school a real mess now?

45:20.617 --> 45:24.688
The foundation that used to run Kirin
took its operation overseas,

45:25.389 --> 45:27.758
so the current foundation took over.

45:28.692 --> 45:30.694
Their biggest mistake
was leaving everything

45:30.761 --> 45:31.762
up to the new principal.

45:33.297 --> 45:36.333
He did away with the past curriculum

45:36.400 --> 45:38.869
that focused on practical training

45:38.936 --> 45:42.606
and is now stressing only
theory and fundamentals.

45:43.540 --> 45:47.511
How do they expect their kids
to compete in this day and age?

45:48.612 --> 45:52.449
He managed to bring the school down
in just three years.

45:52.850 --> 45:55.719
It's amazing how quickly he managed
to ruin an entire school.

45:57.554 --> 45:59.089
And the parents

46:00.224 --> 46:01.692
just sat back and watched?

46:02.192 --> 46:06.096
Most of the talented kids
left the school a while back.

46:06.830 --> 46:10.334
The kids who are there now
are mediocre at best,

46:10.400 --> 46:12.236
and their parents
don't really give a hoot.

46:15.572 --> 46:16.406
Really?

46:17.441 --> 46:19.309
THE HOLY BIBLE

46:19.376 --> 46:21.645
It's so heavy.
How will you take them all to Chungju?

46:21.712 --> 46:24.181
You should've just gotten a couple.
You have a tiny congregation.

46:24.915 --> 46:27.317
Any news?

46:27.584 --> 46:28.786
About what?

46:29.119 --> 46:30.621
Your audition.

46:31.155 --> 46:33.357
I've been busy with school--

46:34.324 --> 46:35.759
Enough with your excuses.

46:36.326 --> 46:37.995
You promised to go to seminary...

46:38.328 --> 46:40.597
God won't like it.

46:40.931 --> 46:43.133
Plus, it's not like anyone
can get into seminary.

46:43.700 --> 46:45.002
You're not just anyone.

46:45.502 --> 46:47.538
God loves you dearly.

46:47.604 --> 46:51.008
You don't know what I'm up to
or how God feels about me.

46:51.074 --> 46:55.512
Pray day and night
to lead the flock as He wishes--

46:55.579 --> 46:56.713
I've converted.

46:57.815 --> 47:00.250
-What?
-I'm into shamanism.

47:00.417 --> 47:01.451
I even bowed.

47:06.256 --> 47:07.090
Dad.

47:08.125 --> 47:10.928
You shouldn't forget that you're a pastor.

47:11.762 --> 47:13.697
Let's go to Chungju. Let's go home.

47:14.865 --> 47:16.800
-You need to repent and pray.
-Gosh.

47:16.867 --> 47:18.902
A student belongs at school.

47:18.969 --> 47:20.237
Forget about school.

47:20.304 --> 47:23.407
-Come back home with me.
-No. I don't want to.

47:24.474 --> 47:28.011
Did you just talk back to me?

47:32.349 --> 47:34.184
Hey! Hae-seong!

47:36.153 --> 47:37.254
Wait, Hae-seong!

47:40.424 --> 47:41.859
People say an immature daughter

47:41.925 --> 47:44.928
is much more fun to raise
than a thoughtful one.

47:45.762 --> 47:47.764
Just raise me for fun, okay?

47:48.398 --> 47:51.468
You have five daughters.
One misfit's not a big deal, right?

47:52.502 --> 47:54.638
I have to run. I'm sorry.

47:55.639 --> 47:56.473
Hae-seong.

47:57.341 --> 47:58.542
Hae-seong!

48:03.580 --> 48:04.882
Oh, Lord.

48:24.868 --> 48:26.603
Maybe I need to do more warm-up exercises.

48:28.972 --> 48:32.809
Your singing lacks emotional sincerity.
All you do is embellish.

48:40.951 --> 48:43.186
You have no sense of rhythm,
your pitch is worrisome,

48:43.253 --> 48:44.988
and your tone is mediocre.

49:00.737 --> 49:02.105
I might have to try out for this.

49:24.594 --> 49:25.762
Why are we here?

49:27.064 --> 49:28.265
So that you can look around.

49:29.466 --> 49:30.400
Look around this school?

49:39.910 --> 49:42.012
-You startled me.
-Here.

49:42.679 --> 49:43.580
What is it?

49:44.448 --> 49:47.484
I wrote this for my assignment.

49:47.551 --> 49:48.919
It's not perfect yet though.

49:49.486 --> 49:50.320
So?

49:50.988 --> 49:52.522
Arrange it for me.

49:53.890 --> 49:54.725
I don't want to.

49:58.595 --> 50:01.465
I know you're sorry
about everything you've done to me.

50:01.531 --> 50:03.400
-This is a chance--
-I'm not sorry at all.

50:04.134 --> 50:06.336
This is so important to me.

50:06.503 --> 50:08.405
Do you need more money? How much?

50:09.573 --> 50:10.640
I'll pay you 30,000 won.

50:11.174 --> 50:14.311
What's this? "Strive against great odds."

50:14.378 --> 50:15.779
Struggle.

50:16.446 --> 50:18.782
This crossword puzzle is substandard.

50:22.686 --> 50:23.820
Who is it?

50:28.458 --> 50:29.292
What is it?

50:30.660 --> 50:31.628
Well?

50:32.596 --> 50:35.332
Who is it? Why aren't you answering?

50:38.335 --> 50:39.503
Long time no see, Jeong-wan.

50:43.707 --> 50:44.775
What brings you here?

50:57.154 --> 51:00.457
I'll pay you 50,000 won. Okay, 60,000 won.
How about 80,000 won?

51:01.124 --> 51:02.125
Fine, 100,000 won.

51:02.726 --> 51:04.761
Even if for a million won,
I still don't want to help you.

51:04.828 --> 51:05.662
Why not?

51:06.763 --> 51:08.532
You're submitting it to Oz Entertainment.

51:08.598 --> 51:09.733
So?

51:10.467 --> 51:12.736
You can't submit my work to a place
that hypnotize kids

51:13.303 --> 51:14.671
with pathetic pop music.

51:15.138 --> 51:16.006
No way.

51:16.073 --> 51:18.241
Why don't you listen to
what I composed just once?

51:18.308 --> 51:20.710
You could love it so much
that you might want to arrange it.

51:20.777 --> 51:21.912
I don't want to.

51:21.978 --> 51:24.681
Just ten seconds, okay? Please?

51:25.082 --> 51:26.416
You have no shame.

51:26.483 --> 51:29.152
I know. I've always been shameless.
So, please...

51:30.454 --> 51:32.089
If I don't like what I hear,
I won't do it.

51:32.589 --> 51:33.423
Okay.

51:52.142 --> 51:53.009
How is it?

51:53.510 --> 51:54.411
Forget it.

51:56.012 --> 51:57.247
Why?

51:57.547 --> 51:59.583
I told you I wouldn't do it
if I didn't like what I heard.

51:59.649 --> 52:01.485
What don't you like about it?

52:02.352 --> 52:03.520
Honestly,

52:04.354 --> 52:06.356
I would do better in my sleep.

52:07.757 --> 52:09.926
I spent a month on it.

52:10.427 --> 52:11.995
Don't pretend
you're taking this seriously.

52:12.896 --> 52:13.763
An idol star?

52:14.564 --> 52:15.732
Why do you want to become one?

52:17.000 --> 52:18.869
"I'll lip-synch if I can't sing.

52:19.736 --> 52:21.705
I'll wear snazzy outfits
if I can't dance."

52:21.805 --> 52:25.275
Is that what you're thinking?

52:26.176 --> 52:27.177
No, it's not.

52:28.011 --> 52:30.013
That's what it looks like to me.

52:31.515 --> 52:33.884
You have no passion or interest in music.

52:33.950 --> 52:35.719
You just want to be famous,

52:35.919 --> 52:38.688
so you'll sing, dance, and smile
exactly like everyone else

52:38.755 --> 52:40.390
as they tell you to.

52:42.292 --> 52:43.793
Don't you think that's disgusting?

52:44.661 --> 52:46.129
You're not a puppet.

52:48.598 --> 52:50.100
I don't want to do as I'm told.

52:50.867 --> 52:52.335
I don't want to be like everyone else.

52:54.437 --> 52:55.972
A human being is not a puppet.

52:59.976 --> 53:01.144
I want to be human

53:02.145 --> 53:03.613
and do the music I like.

53:04.314 --> 53:05.615
You sure talk a lot.

53:06.082 --> 53:07.984
What kind of music do you want to do?

53:08.251 --> 53:09.886
-Rock.
-What?

53:10.287 --> 53:11.288
Rock.

53:12.689 --> 53:13.557
Oh, rock.

53:14.257 --> 53:15.091
Yes.

53:20.130 --> 53:22.532
Listen. I know a thing or two about rock.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.201
There's no money in it.

53:25.769 --> 53:28.371
I'm going to make it big

53:28.972 --> 53:33.009
and tour the world in my private jet
to play the music I like.

53:33.643 --> 53:34.477
Fine.

53:36.112 --> 53:37.180
Next?

53:37.247 --> 53:38.148
"U-jae."

53:38.582 --> 53:39.983
What do you plan to do?

53:41.518 --> 53:46.389
I want to do dance music.

53:48.558 --> 53:49.392
Really?

53:50.327 --> 53:53.163
So you want to become a teen idol.
Then why the guitar?

53:53.897 --> 53:56.933
Don't play it if you're not great.
Lose the guitar.

53:57.100 --> 53:58.768
I can play well.

54:03.840 --> 54:04.741
Fine.

54:05.675 --> 54:06.977
All right. Jin Yu-jin.

54:07.077 --> 54:08.845
Hey, rocker. You go first.

54:39.643 --> 54:41.077
Okay. That's enough.

54:45.315 --> 54:47.250
Next up is number 14, Jang U-jae.

54:47.784 --> 54:48.618
What is this?

54:50.020 --> 54:50.987
The same song?

54:52.555 --> 54:53.657
Yes.

54:57.460 --> 54:58.461
All right, let's hear it.

55:55.885 --> 55:56.953
Do you want to dance?

55:59.622 --> 56:01.558
If you don't want to help me, fine.

56:01.624 --> 56:04.861
But get off your high horse.
You sell your music for 10,000 won.

56:05.261 --> 56:06.496
What did you say?

56:08.365 --> 56:10.567
Your favorite JB or whatever...

56:11.000 --> 56:13.169
Did you know that his group's
latest single was plagiarized?

56:14.637 --> 56:17.774
If they didn't cause that recent incident,
everyone would have found out.

56:19.509 --> 56:21.311
If you want to become a singer,
shouldn't you know

56:22.011 --> 56:23.446
shouldn't you know what kind of music

56:23.513 --> 56:25.682
your favorite singer
is making and singing?

56:32.922 --> 56:35.125
Who says it's plagiarized?

56:38.561 --> 56:40.063
I'll listen to your piece and help you.

56:40.230 --> 56:41.097
Wait...

56:41.631 --> 56:42.732
What are you doing here?

56:44.868 --> 56:47.670
Are you here because of the favor
I did for you the other day?

56:50.106 --> 56:51.741
Maybe it's because of that.

57:08.558 --> 57:10.693
It only feels like yesterday
I went on cigarette runs for you.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.061
Time sure flies.

57:13.329 --> 57:15.865
So, is it better
now that you're back in Korea?

57:17.100 --> 57:20.103
It's all the same.
I live because I'm alive.

57:20.170 --> 57:21.604
Look at my graying hair.

57:24.174 --> 57:27.410
You know I'm running an agency, right?

57:27.477 --> 57:28.645
Yes.

57:28.878 --> 57:29.712
So?

57:30.146 --> 57:32.315
Thinking of transferring your kids here?

57:32.782 --> 57:34.050
How many?

57:35.685 --> 57:36.519
No.

57:37.687 --> 57:38.922
We're actually...

57:40.657 --> 57:42.459
going to acquire Kirin.

57:43.193 --> 57:45.195
Naturally, all our kids
will be coming here.

57:47.363 --> 57:48.331
What are you talking about?

57:50.433 --> 57:52.335
This is a school, not a company.

57:52.969 --> 57:54.204
What's this about an acquisition?

57:56.639 --> 57:57.774
What are you going to do?

58:02.378 --> 58:03.413
I'll be the director.

58:17.694 --> 58:18.828
You must be a genius.

58:19.762 --> 58:21.431
I can have this, right?

58:21.498 --> 58:23.399
It's just basic chords.

58:23.700 --> 58:24.868
Way too basic.

58:25.668 --> 58:27.403
I could do it in five minutes
with my eyes closed.

58:28.338 --> 58:30.206
You must have an inferiority complex
toward an idol.

58:30.974 --> 58:31.908
You make it look obvious.

58:32.709 --> 58:33.543
Me?

58:34.110 --> 58:37.413
Doesn't it hurt your pride
to be so blatant?

58:38.882 --> 58:40.016
Then again...

58:41.217 --> 58:42.151
Then again what?

58:42.585 --> 58:44.487
Can't you finish your sentence?

58:44.554 --> 58:48.758
Some losers need to belittle
what everyone else thinks is good.

58:49.392 --> 58:51.094
To look better than everyone else.

58:51.528 --> 58:52.762
Loser?

58:53.096 --> 58:55.365
Did you just call me a loser?

58:56.566 --> 59:00.503
Please calm down, JB.
What's wrong with you, Yu-jin?

59:00.570 --> 59:03.106
-Lay off. I'm trying to stay cool.
-JB?

59:03.172 --> 59:04.541
Wow, it's JB.

59:04.908 --> 59:06.175
Five minutes with your eyes closed?

59:08.111 --> 59:09.145
Give it a go then.

59:16.085 --> 59:17.587
Watch.

59:18.254 --> 59:21.090
You will witness
how talentless that jerk is

59:21.157 --> 59:22.725
in just five minutes.

59:24.627 --> 59:26.696
Let me take out the trash first.

59:34.437 --> 59:35.572
What did you just do?

59:35.638 --> 59:37.974
Did you delete the song? Are you nuts?

59:38.308 --> 59:40.343
The trash can.

59:40.977 --> 59:43.813
What will you do with that trash?
It's not even fit to recycle.

59:43.880 --> 59:47.684
Yu-jin, calm down and give me the mouse.

59:47.750 --> 59:50.954
You should take out the trash right away
to keep the flies at bay.

59:51.020 --> 59:52.388
I'll make you something decent.

59:52.956 --> 59:55.158
You're going to regret this
for the rest of your life.

59:55.224 --> 59:56.826
Oh, no.

59:56.893 --> 59:58.227
My finger must have a will of its own.

1:00:03.366 --> 1:00:05.101
Jin Yu-jin, you're a total psycho!

1:00:11.541 --> 1:00:13.843
What are you doing?

1:00:15.044 --> 1:00:18.047
Keeping your promise with fans
was more important than the law?

1:00:18.848 --> 1:00:20.116
Give me a break.

1:00:21.684 --> 1:00:23.786
Does it make you feel
like you're actually good

1:00:24.554 --> 1:00:26.389
because idiots like her think
you're the bee's knees?

1:00:29.559 --> 1:00:33.329
For kids like you,
there should be a law against delusion.

1:00:48.611 --> 1:00:50.179
You're the one who's delusional.

1:00:53.616 --> 1:00:55.118
If you're so talented,

1:00:55.818 --> 1:00:57.920
why doesn't the rest of the world see it?

1:01:03.593 --> 1:01:04.661
Isn't it funny?

1:01:12.702 --> 1:01:13.670
If you punch me,

1:01:14.671 --> 1:01:16.072
you might be able to become famous.

1:01:17.674 --> 1:01:19.342
Don't talk crap like a loser.

1:01:20.610 --> 1:01:21.811
Punch me if you want to.

1:01:22.145 --> 1:01:23.112
You little...

1:02:09.092 --> 1:02:10.693
Are we transferring to Kirin Art School?

1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:11.894
Everyone at the agency?

1:02:11.961 --> 1:02:13.796
This is amazing.

1:02:13.863 --> 1:02:16.099
There's something to be said
for a large entertainment agency.

1:02:16.165 --> 1:02:17.533
You'll follow my methods, right?

1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:20.036
Why are there so many
rules and regulations?

1:02:20.103 --> 1:02:21.738
I'll follow every single one of them.

1:02:21.804 --> 1:02:25.274
The school is your studio,
and your dorm room is your apartment.

1:02:25.341 --> 1:02:26.476
There aren't enough rooms,

1:02:26.642 --> 1:02:30.079
so students with low GPAs
will be kicked out of the dorm.

1:02:30.146 --> 1:02:31.247
That vile scumbag.

1:02:31.881 --> 1:02:33.116
The door was open?

1:02:33.182 --> 1:02:35.585
-I swear I didn't touch a thing.
-Is something wrong?

1:02:35.651 --> 1:02:37.353
I knew that this would be my grave.

1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:38.988
You're disrupting the class. Get out.

1:02:39.055 --> 1:02:40.690
Do you have to dance to be a singer?

1:02:41.290 --> 1:02:43.760
I've had enough of you.
Why don't you get lost?
