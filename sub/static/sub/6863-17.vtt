00:00.968 --> 00:03.504
Warner Brothers bought
my book for six figures.

00:03.537 --> 00:05.806
The movie's fast-tracked.
We're going to London in July.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.242
ZOE:
 Opportunities arise, and
 he says that he's coming back,

00:08.276 --> 00:10.311
but we know that he's not.

00:10.344 --> 00:13.181
Shelby is selling Fancie's
and I intend on buying it.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.149
You want me to purchase
Fancie's in my name,

00:15.183 --> 00:16.784
sell you half
and be your business partner.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.018
She's driving me crazy!
He's driving me crazy!

00:18.052 --> 00:20.521
I so told you that working
together was a bad idea.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.256
It's like, everything
that I tolerated about you

00:22.290 --> 00:23.324
for the past 15 years

00:23.357 --> 00:24.792
just started to
drive me insane again,

00:24.825 --> 00:26.094
like how stubborn you are.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.095
Oh! How stubborn I am?
Yeah!

00:31.432 --> 00:33.434
*

00:42.343 --> 00:44.312
Joel.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.347
*

00:53.154 --> 00:54.222
(laughing)

00:54.255 --> 00:55.356
(sighs)

00:56.490 --> 00:57.391
(laughs)

00:57.425 --> 01:00.328
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:00.361 --> 01:04.364
(car horn honking)

01:04.397 --> 01:06.400
*

01:11.405 --> 01:13.374
(breathing heavily)

01:17.278 --> 01:19.247
Oh, boy...

01:19.280 --> 01:21.249
George!
Lemon.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.450
BOTH:
Hi. Um...

01:22.483 --> 01:24.252
You know, we-- uh,
we should probably talk.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.253
Yeah, we should,
we need...

01:25.286 --> 01:26.254
Um, uh...
Uh...

01:26.287 --> 01:27.521
Um, I-- did you pay the,

01:27.555 --> 01:29.457
the fish vendor yet?

01:29.490 --> 01:30.291
Oh. Oh. Yes.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.525
I was gonna go do that now.
(laughs)

01:31.559 --> 01:32.860
Okay, good. Yeah.
Great. Okay.

01:32.893 --> 01:33.861
I'll just-- good.
See you later.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.163
Bye, actually...
Oh. Well...

01:35.196 --> 01:36.297
Have a good--
have a great day.

01:38.199 --> 01:41.269
Joel's mug.
(sighs)

01:41.302 --> 01:43.904
Yeah... it's pathetic, I know.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.474
I'm so sorry, Z.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.610
Believe me, I-I get how
hard this must be on you.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.679
I just... why can't
I ever have a relationship

01:51.712 --> 01:52.713
that lasts for once?

01:53.714 --> 01:54.882
I don't know.

01:54.915 --> 01:57.618
I mean, look at my romantic
history since I moved here:

01:57.651 --> 01:58.919
George had a fiancÃ©.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.321
Wade-- well,
we know what he did.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.323
And then Joel sold
his stupid book to Hollywood

02:02.356 --> 02:03.591
and moved away.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.892
Yeah, but I'm not
sure it's luck

02:04.925 --> 02:08.262
so much as bad circumstances...

02:08.295 --> 02:10.464
and maybe
imperfect relationships.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.933
No, Joel and I would have been
together forever

02:12.966 --> 02:15.236
if he hadn't sold
that stupid book.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.937
Which he did,
because I have terrible,

02:16.970 --> 02:18.206
bad, bad luck.

02:18.239 --> 02:21.275
And it's a good book, mostly,
because of my bad luck, though.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.314
(sighs)

02:26.347 --> 02:27.648
(sighs)

02:29.283 --> 02:32.286
See? It's like I'm cursed.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.357
(video game whirring)

02:38.426 --> 02:39.427
Can I ask you a question?

02:39.460 --> 02:42.230
Yeah... Yeah. Go ahead, hit me.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.232
Say the biggest jerk in school,

02:44.265 --> 02:45.065
Bobby Webster,

02:45.098 --> 02:46.300
wants to borrow
your lunch money...

02:46.334 --> 02:49.570
Okay, um, Harley, would you
excuse us for a second? Come on.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.272
Hold that thought.
All right, bud?

02:54.475 --> 02:55.443
What's up?

02:55.476 --> 02:56.477
(moaning)

02:59.713 --> 03:03.551
Hmm, well, what was that for?

03:03.584 --> 03:05.286
That was Charles on the phone.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.987
He's gonna be at Aunt
Winifred's barbecue tomorrow

03:07.020 --> 03:08.722
and he wants to meet you.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.758
So... like, Prince Charles,

03:10.791 --> 03:14.595
Charles Barkley, or Charles
as in your ex-husband Charles?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.964
I know, it's weird, but
we're on good terms,

03:16.997 --> 03:19.367
and since you are now
in Harley's life,

03:19.400 --> 03:21.269
he wants to get to know you.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.437
Yeah. Yeah. No problemo.
Let's do it.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.972
Great.
Mm.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.974
(moans)
I'm gonna RSVP now.

03:27.007 --> 03:30.478
All right. You better save
a little bit of that for later.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.447
All right. Where were we?

03:33.481 --> 03:35.283
Um, you were about
to give me advice.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.284
Right. Right. Right.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.084
Uh...

03:37.117 --> 03:40.020
Look, I-I-I got
a question for you:

03:40.053 --> 03:44.358
Is this kid, is he
borrowing your lunch money,

03:44.392 --> 03:45.993
or is he kind of more like
stealing your lunch money?

03:46.026 --> 03:47.661
I think it's the latter.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.997
Yeah. Yeah. I figured.

03:50.030 --> 03:53.701
Um... look,
nine out of ten times,

03:53.734 --> 03:55.736
the only way you're gonna
stop a bully...

03:55.769 --> 03:57.037
is by standing up to him.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.408
But Bobby Webster is scary,
he growls at me.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.477
Hey. Then you growl right back.
(growls fiercely)

04:06.847 --> 04:08.516
Yeah. I can do that.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.050
All right.
Let's hear it. Come on.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.353
(growls timidly)
No, more.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.588
(growls)
Oh, man, that's
so good! You're scary.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.324
(laughs)
Nice.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.426
All right.
(laughs)

04:18.459 --> 04:19.760
Frank, this is a pharmacy.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.394
Okay, you got to have something.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.296
A vitamin, anything.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.598
Stop flashbacks
or memories or, you know,

04:24.632 --> 04:27.267
just maybe in general
help me make better decisions.

04:28.068 --> 04:30.704
We just got in
some chamomile tea.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.706
Everything okay, George?

04:32.740 --> 04:34.041
Yes. Of course.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.343
Why, what have you heard?

04:35.376 --> 04:37.578
Hmm? Y-Y-You just look flushed.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.513
No. No. I'm fine.
I'm, I'm fine.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.549
You don't seem fine,
you seem distressed.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.517
Distressed?

04:43.551 --> 04:44.585
That's exactly what I am.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.519
Doc... I--

04:45.553 --> 04:47.655
I need to talk to you
for a second, Doc.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.057
I-I also need a doctor-
patient confidentiality.

04:50.090 --> 04:53.060
You know, because
I did something big.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.828
Big. Huge.
What?

04:57.665 --> 05:00.534
With Lemon?!
Shh!

05:00.568 --> 05:03.070
Please don't tell me you have
feelings for her again.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.338
No! No.
That woman drives me nuts.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.807
So nuts that I want to, I want
to strangle her half the time.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.808
But the sex

05:07.841 --> 05:10.378
was-was amazing.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.311
And now I can't stop
picturing it.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.680
Like, seriously,
every time I look at her,

05:12.713 --> 05:14.382
I'm physically unable

05:14.415 --> 05:16.083
to stop picturing it.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.452
Well, now I can't either,
so thank you for that.

05:18.486 --> 05:19.520
So what do I do here, okay?

05:19.553 --> 05:21.555
'Cause I-I got to be able
to look her in the eye

05:21.589 --> 05:23.524
because we own
a business together and I...

05:23.557 --> 05:24.525
I'm freaking out.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.427
Well, uh, George, I don't...

05:26.460 --> 05:28.362
Look, no offense, all right, but
this is too much for me today.

05:28.396 --> 05:31.098
I have my own tragic, cursed
love life to deal with.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.433
No. No, no.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.402
(sighs)

05:34.435 --> 05:36.504
Whoa! Dr. Hart.
(laughs)

05:36.537 --> 05:37.838
Is that you?

05:37.871 --> 05:39.440
(laughs)
What happened to you?

05:39.473 --> 05:41.442
(laughs)

05:48.749 --> 05:50.818
(Lemon sighs)

05:50.851 --> 05:53.754
Hi, um,
a dozen jelly doughnuts, please.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.756
Actually, make that two dozen.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.759
Lemon, you okay?

05:58.792 --> 06:00.728
Oh. Oh!
(laughs)

06:00.761 --> 06:02.463
I'm great.
Perfect.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.531
Uh, why do you ask?

06:03.564 --> 06:04.732
Because you only eat
jelly doughnuts

06:04.765 --> 06:06.634
when you're in
an emotional crisis.

06:06.667 --> 06:07.735
Oh, no, I'm fine.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.170
Okay. I'm not.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.574
But, I really, really
can't talk about it.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.675
Oh, come on now.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.876
I mean, you obviously
need to talk.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.144
I'm here.
(laughs)

06:17.177 --> 06:18.579
(sighs)

06:21.715 --> 06:22.783
(sighs)

06:24.718 --> 06:26.186
(whispering):
I had sex with George Tucker.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.655
(laughing)

06:28.822 --> 06:30.591
Oh, no.

06:30.624 --> 06:31.592
No. No...

06:31.625 --> 06:33.861
Well, see, I knew
I shouldn't have told you.

06:33.894 --> 06:34.895
Yeah. You shouldn't have.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.499
Do you have feelings
for him again?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.568
What?! No!

06:40.601 --> 06:41.669
Well, I don't think so.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.704
Listen, we fight
all the time,

06:43.737 --> 06:44.905
I can barely stand him.
All right?

06:44.938 --> 06:47.775
But I-I mean,
not to sound indelicate,

06:47.808 --> 06:50.511
but the event itself was...

06:50.544 --> 06:51.812
spectacular. (laughs)

06:51.845 --> 06:53.481
T-TMI, Lemon.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.515
You know,
I'm just gonna tell him

06:54.548 --> 06:55.816
it was a mistake. Right?

06:55.849 --> 06:57.685
That sounds l-like
a good idea. Right?

06:57.718 --> 06:59.520
Look, on second thought,
this is...

06:59.553 --> 07:00.854
ten kinds of weird for me.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.523
You're gonna need
someone else to confide in.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.724
G-Good luck.
Well, no.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.526
Lavon. Lavo...

07:09.229 --> 07:11.198
JEFFRIES:
Hey, Burt,
the doctor's single now.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.200
You can ask her
to the senior social.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.569
Yeah... pass.
(laughs)

07:15.603 --> 07:16.804
Hey!

07:16.837 --> 07:18.506
Wh...
(scoffs)

07:18.539 --> 07:19.740
I'm standing right here.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.908
Well...

07:21.975 --> 07:22.810
Ow!

07:22.843 --> 07:24.211
(laughing)

07:24.244 --> 07:25.513
Hey, be careful!

07:27.247 --> 07:28.215
Ow!

07:28.248 --> 07:29.517
(gasps)

07:31.519 --> 07:32.553
(sighs)

07:33.721 --> 07:36.223
Do you think it's possible
that I'm cursed?

07:36.256 --> 07:38.225
You know... I do.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.226
Really?!

07:39.259 --> 07:40.761
I think I was once.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.697
Remember when Chase Cobb
gave me syphilis

07:43.731 --> 07:46.033
and I accidentally gave it
to the Reverend's wife?

07:46.066 --> 07:49.002
That was an undue amount
of bad luck.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.538
Well, how'd you turn it around?

07:50.571 --> 07:51.739
It's gonna sound silly.

07:51.772 --> 07:52.706
(sighs)

07:52.740 --> 07:55.743
But I went to see a psychic,
Madame Van Horn.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.045
She gave me some advice...

07:58.078 --> 07:59.880
I met Tom...

07:59.913 --> 08:01.849
and now we're happily married
with a baby goat.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.684
I could never see a psychic.

08:03.717 --> 08:04.752
I mean, I'm a doctor.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.688
Okay... I'm gonna
get you a towel.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.657
Your head seems to be bleeding.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.592
What?

08:11.625 --> 08:12.960
Where?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.662
(gasps)

08:14.695 --> 08:15.729
Oh...

08:15.763 --> 08:18.065
A curse, you say.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.900
You may be right.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.636
The cards suggest
a transgression in your past

08:22.670 --> 08:23.871
is responsible.

08:23.904 --> 08:24.905
Really?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.540
A wedding.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.809
No. But I've never been married.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.878
There's a storm...

08:30.911 --> 08:32.580
and the groom...

08:32.613 --> 08:34.014
he never makes it
down the aisle.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.917
Oh. That wedding.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.686
Tha-- it wasn't my fault.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.020
Not entirely.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.889
A wedding is
a very sacred thing.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.289
Breaking up one
is one of the

08:43.323 --> 08:45.292
worst cosmic sins
you can commit.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.894
That explains so much.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.597
It explains everything.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.931
The universe is punishing you.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.033
Your luck in love
will never change

08:53.066 --> 08:55.302
until you right this wrong.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.070
But how?

08:58.672 --> 09:01.308
That was a long time ago
and they've moved on.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.076
But...

09:03.110 --> 09:04.645
Oh, my God.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.847
I'm gonna get Lemon
and George back together.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.717
(scoffs)

09:09.750 --> 09:10.718
(laughing):
Yeah.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.986
(car horn honks)

09:13.020 --> 09:15.122
(seagulls calling)

09:17.791 --> 09:19.660
(birds singing)

09:28.101 --> 09:29.603
Hello.

09:29.637 --> 09:32.339
I have some very,
very bad news for you.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.074
You know how you had
an affair with Lemon

09:34.107 --> 09:35.743
and I had a flirtation
with George

09:35.776 --> 09:36.576
and we're both
sort of behind

09:36.610 --> 09:37.845
their whole wedding
falling apart?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.613
Yeah.

09:39.647 --> 09:40.848
Well, it turns out

09:40.881 --> 09:43.684
that, because of
that, we are cursed.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.753
I spoke to a psychic last night.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.154
I wish you'd spoken to a shrink.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.789
I realize that
it's illogical,

09:48.822 --> 09:51.091
but, here in BlueBell,
I kind of think it's possible.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.761
Well, as the mayor of BlueBell,

09:53.794 --> 09:54.962
I assure you,

09:54.995 --> 09:56.830
there are no curses.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.031
Wait. No. Lavon. Lavon.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.366
Wai-- think about it.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.768
None of us--

10:00.801 --> 10:02.102
not me, not George,

10:02.135 --> 10:03.737
not Lemon, not you--

10:03.771 --> 10:04.738
have had any luck in love

10:04.772 --> 10:05.739
since that wedding dissolved.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.107
And the news gets worse.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.676
Worse than the curse?

10:08.709 --> 10:11.044
Madame Van Horn says the only
way to set things right

10:11.078 --> 10:12.680
is to get Lemon
and George back together.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.682
What? No. No.

10:14.715 --> 10:15.983
Look, Zoe, I-I realize
you have not been

10:16.016 --> 10:18.018
in your right mind
since the breakup, okay.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.120
But take that notion
and put it out of your head.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.722
Right now.
The thing is,

10:21.755 --> 10:24.725
I have my reasons
to believe that Lem-eorge,

10:24.758 --> 10:26.026
is not as far-fetched
as we think.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.662
What do you know?

10:28.696 --> 10:30.698
What do you know?

10:31.832 --> 10:32.632
Aha!

10:33.166 --> 10:34.802
Lemon told you.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.737
See, they are already
on their way.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.038
They just need
a little encouragement.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.808
Oh, no. No, no. No.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.209
Hey, come on,
Lavon.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.144
Look, those two,
they aren't the same people

10:44.177 --> 10:45.713
they were when they broke up.

10:45.746 --> 10:46.814
Maybe they're
more compatible now.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.416
And it's our job to guide them.

10:49.449 --> 10:50.550
Our?
Mm-hmm,

10:50.583 --> 10:52.820
you were arguably more
responsible for their breakup

10:52.853 --> 10:54.021
than I was.
Therefore, we are...

10:54.054 --> 10:55.723
Not gonna meddle.

10:55.756 --> 10:56.757
...curse buddies.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.826
See you later, pal.

11:03.864 --> 11:04.698
Hey, you.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.466
Did you tell Harley
to pick a fight

11:06.499 --> 11:07.835
with some punk
twice his size?

11:07.868 --> 11:09.937
What? No.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.973
Look, he came to me. He told me
that some kid at school was

11:13.006 --> 11:14.742
stealing his lunch money.
I just...

11:14.775 --> 11:18.445
You told him to growl
at Bobby Webster.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.047
Bobby Webster!

11:21.214 --> 11:23.784
Oh, geez. Man...

11:25.953 --> 11:27.120
So that's him, huh?

11:27.154 --> 11:28.455
You're Roadhouse?

11:28.488 --> 11:29.990
Okay, I'll handle
this, Charles.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.792
Roadhouse?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.894
He started calling you Roadhouse

11:33.927 --> 11:36.063
because of some
Patrick Swayze movie

11:36.096 --> 11:37.798
where the bartender
gets into fights or...

11:37.831 --> 11:39.066
You know, it's actually
a great movie.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.201
Not a bartender, though.
He's a bouncer.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.702
Really?

11:43.804 --> 11:47.074
Look, the kid came
to me in confidence.

11:47.107 --> 11:50.477
I was, I was just trying
to help.

11:50.510 --> 11:51.945
But you didn't.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.214
And now my ex thinks
that I'm dating

11:54.247 --> 11:55.816
some overgrown teenage bonehead

11:55.849 --> 11:58.085
who's a bad influence
on his son.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.955
I'm sorry,
and I will fix this, all right,

12:01.989 --> 12:03.123
with both of them.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.092
You'd better.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.960
All right.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.999
Oh, hey, Zoe.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.234
Hey, George.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.936
So, listen, about yesterday,

12:15.969 --> 12:17.905
you said you needed
a friend,

12:17.938 --> 12:20.140
and I wasn't there for you.
And I am so sorry.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.509
No, that's-that's okay.
Don't even worry about it.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.845
I was just thinking about
what you told me.

12:24.878 --> 12:28.015
You know, how you can't stop
picturing...

12:28.048 --> 12:30.017
And I have a theory.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.519
I am in the throes
of an early midlife crisis?

12:32.552 --> 12:34.221
No. You have feelings for Lemon!

12:34.254 --> 12:35.923
Uh, no.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.125
And she has feelings
for you, too.

12:38.158 --> 12:41.995
I'm sorry.
She has... for me... Really?

12:42.029 --> 12:44.264
Okay, I'm pretty sure, you know?

12:44.297 --> 12:47.334
You can't deny that something
is drawing you to each other...

12:47.367 --> 12:48.902
repeatedly.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.138
You went into business together,
you slept together.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.006
Yes, but I don't know why

12:53.040 --> 12:54.908
I did either of those
two things, so...

12:54.942 --> 12:57.010
George, you were with Lemon
for 15 years.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.846
That's half of your lives.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.147
You are a part
of each other.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.548
Maybe you need
the other

13:01.581 --> 13:03.016
to feel whole again.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.051
No, no.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.587
Zoe, (chuckles) the woman
annoys me to no end.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.156
I-I hate her most of the time.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.991
But just so you know,

13:11.024 --> 13:13.060
the brain releases the same
chemical for love and hate:

13:13.093 --> 13:14.294
oxytocin.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.863
Oxy what now?

13:15.896 --> 13:16.329
Good talk.

13:20.868 --> 13:21.902
ANNABETH:
Ooh, Davis Polk,

13:21.935 --> 13:23.871
our number one
frequent flyer!

13:23.904 --> 13:24.905
Dr. Breeland,

13:24.938 --> 13:27.307
tell Mr. Polk what he's won!

13:27.340 --> 13:29.576
Wha-What's that?
I don't know.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.179
I'm sorry, I was just, uh,
trying to keep things light

13:32.212 --> 13:34.014
since we get to see you a lot.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.316
The poor man is suffering
from headaches.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.217
A lot of headaches.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.118
Which is why

13:38.151 --> 13:40.320
we're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.222
AB, please make Davis
an appointment at
Mobile Memorial

13:42.255 --> 13:44.291
for a full blood panel
and an MRI.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.994
What? No-no!

13:47.027 --> 13:48.195
Are you sure
that's necessary?

13:48.228 --> 13:49.897
Davis, you've
been suffering

13:49.930 --> 13:51.899
from headaches nearly every
other day for a month.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.033
We need to rule things out.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.868
Now, AB will call you
with the time.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.239
Okay.
Okay. (chuckles)

14:02.342 --> 14:04.077
Do you think maybe
you could adopt

14:04.111 --> 14:05.913
a more generous attitude
towards our patients?

14:05.946 --> 14:07.915
I will,
when they're actually sick.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.117
Why are you sending this guy
in for tests?

14:10.150 --> 14:11.351
He is a hypochondriac!

14:11.384 --> 14:13.453
Make the appointment.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.958
(chuckles)

14:17.991 --> 14:19.927
Oh, hello, George.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.228
Hello, Lemon.

14:21.261 --> 14:25.132
I was wondering,
did those three cases
of wine happen to come in?

14:25.165 --> 14:27.234
Uh, yeah, they're-they're
in the back.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.069
Okay, great.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.972
Uh, but I need your signature
on the payroll, please.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.173
Uh, sure, yeah.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.443
(clipboard thuds)

14:36.476 --> 14:38.378
(giggles)
That was so-so clumsy!

14:38.411 --> 14:40.914
No worries,
no worries.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.349
(chuckles)
So stupid.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.418
Lemon, we need to talk.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.160
(chuckles)

14:53.193 --> 14:56.429
You know, yes,
we should.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.135
I, uh, uh,

15:02.169 --> 15:03.670
I like your shirt.
(chuckles)

15:03.703 --> 15:06.940
Really? Oh, well, thank you...
for that.

15:06.974 --> 15:10.343
Um, you know, your,
your top makes you look

15:10.377 --> 15:11.411
really nice as well.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.982
Really, really nice.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.283
Beautiful, even.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.485
Thanks, George. (chuckles)

15:18.518 --> 15:21.054
Well, um, it's good to see you.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.189
But we should definitely talk.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.957
Yes! Yes, we should!

15:23.991 --> 15:26.093
Now.
No, not now. Later.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.494
We should talk later.
'Cause, you know,

15:27.527 --> 15:29.429
so busy. Two jobs.
I gotta go. I have to,

15:29.462 --> 15:32.465
I have things to do.
Okay, good-bye, Lemon.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.172
Hey, Charles.
Hey. Yeah.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.440
Thanks for meeting me, man.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.443
Look, I-I wanted
to apologize in person

15:43.476 --> 15:46.246
and maybe buy you
a cup of coffee.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.015
Well, I appreciate
your apology,

15:48.048 --> 15:49.416
but I'll pass
on the coffee.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.119
I don't want to send
the wrong message.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.187
That you're anti-coffee?
(chuckles)

15:54.221 --> 15:56.023
That I want to get to know you.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.725
And lookit,
I got no problem

15:58.758 --> 16:00.460
with Vivian having
a midlife crisis

16:00.493 --> 16:02.462
with a juvenile bartender

16:02.495 --> 16:05.999
with some rock-hard abs
or whatever, no offense.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.235
Well, none taken, you know.
It's not really an insult.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.170
But in the interest
of keeping Harley
from getting

16:10.203 --> 16:11.538
any more black eyes
from following

16:11.571 --> 16:13.240
your admittedly
nutball advice...

16:13.273 --> 16:14.541
No, actually,

16:14.574 --> 16:16.443
I didn't admit
to giving any nutball advice.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.478
I-I told him
to stand up for himself.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.413
Well, I think we're saying
the same thing.

16:20.447 --> 16:24.751
I think it's best if
you don't see my kid.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.253
Well, except that
I'm already going

16:26.286 --> 16:27.554
to the family barbecue
tomorrow, so...

16:27.587 --> 16:29.256
So you don't go.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.524
Well, that would be rude
seeing as how

16:31.558 --> 16:35.295
for the first time in my life,
actually, I RSVP'd.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.165
Okay, yeah, see
what's happening here?

16:38.198 --> 16:39.332
See what's happening
right here?

16:39.366 --> 16:41.034
This is what
I was talking about.

16:41.068 --> 16:44.571
This is why I did not
accept a coffee from you.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.040
All right, well, the good news
is you'll have another

16:47.074 --> 16:50.009
chance tomorrow, 'cause I'll
see ya at the barbecue.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.415
(clears throat)

16:55.448 --> 16:59.252
Okay, so you might be
a little mad at me.

16:59.286 --> 17:02.222
I may have suggested
to George that he likes Lemon,

17:02.255 --> 17:04.790
and, well, vice versa.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.093
No. No!

17:06.126 --> 17:07.527
Come on.
It's not a lie.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.262
You know, they did do it.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.263
And I just wanted
to see what they'd do next.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.800
Maybe we set them
on a path to reconciliation.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.502
Have you heard anything
from Lemon?

17:16.536 --> 17:19.306
No! Not that I'd tell you
if I did now.

17:20.140 --> 17:20.507
(knocking)

17:20.540 --> 17:23.242
(grunts)

17:28.848 --> 17:30.817
Lavon, I realize
that this is weird,

17:30.850 --> 17:33.086
but you're the only
person who knows,

17:33.120 --> 17:35.422
so you are the only person
that I can talk to.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.424
I'm sure there are others.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.259
Someone, anyone, really.

17:39.292 --> 17:42.562
George is acting so, so,
so, so, so, so weird.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.232
I'll take this.
Lemon, come with me.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.867
I'd like to talk to you
about a little thing

17:47.900 --> 17:50.170
I like to call oxytocin.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.584
Whoo! Lookin' good, Dr. Hart!

18:04.617 --> 18:06.286
Thank you.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.623
Oh! Remember
to be careful.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.160
(shrieks)

18:13.193 --> 18:15.462
Hey, watch where you're going!

18:15.495 --> 18:16.363
(chuckles)

18:17.530 --> 18:19.199
(clears throat)

18:21.368 --> 18:23.136
Mobile Memorial called.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.471
Davis never showed up
for his test.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.606
Really?
Imagine my surprise.

18:26.639 --> 18:30.277
You'll notice my surprise
looks exactly like not
surprised at all.

18:30.310 --> 18:34.214
Look, I do not know
why I have to justify
myself to you,

18:34.247 --> 18:35.882
but believe me when I tell you

18:35.915 --> 18:38.185
that I have considered
the possibility that...

18:38.218 --> 18:39.619
That he is a crazy person?
Yes.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.621
Mm-hmm.
Now, go to his house.

18:41.654 --> 18:45.325
Take him to Mobile Memorial,
A) because you work for me

18:45.358 --> 18:47.527
and B) because what if there
really is something?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.262
You'll hate yourself.
And C)...

18:49.296 --> 18:50.897
'Cause I work for you?
Correct!

18:50.930 --> 18:52.632
"A" and "C" are the same.
Mm-hmm.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.301
What happened to your shirt?

18:54.334 --> 18:56.336
Don't ask.

19:03.543 --> 19:08.448
Lavon, I finally think
my luck has changed.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.649
Today, I got complimented.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.451
I was flirted with!

19:11.484 --> 19:13.320
Maybe 'cause you finally combed
your hair.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.656
Or maybe because Madame Van Horn
was right.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.658
Uh.
I am helping get

19:18.691 --> 19:20.227
the universe back
on track.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.528
Exorcising the curse.

19:21.561 --> 19:24.397
And I wanted you to see.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.199
Wait, that's why
we're here at Fancie's?

19:26.233 --> 19:28.167
You said there was
a crab cake special.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.208
What's wrong with him?

19:35.242 --> 19:36.709
Hello, Lemon. Hey.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.278
Morning, George.

19:38.311 --> 19:41.414
Oh. She don't look
so good either.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.383
Watch and learn, my friend.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.385
Ten bucks says he asks her out
right now.

19:47.987 --> 19:51.558
Um, hey, Lemon,
I, uh...

19:52.725 --> 19:54.961
I heard...

19:54.994 --> 19:57.597
that Hector's having
a great deal on prime rib.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.466
I thought I might get some
for-for Sunday brunch.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.967
What do you think?
(chuckles)

20:01.000 --> 20:03.703
Uh, George, listen, um...

20:03.736 --> 20:05.738
Yes?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.576
Uh, nothing.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.612
No? Oh.
Oh! Oh!

20:15.348 --> 20:17.417
Well, maybe they still
need a tiny push.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.419
Oh, my God. You need
to stop, girl.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.288
What? You just saw them.
They were flirting.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.989
Look, someone is gonna get hurt
here, Zoe,

20:23.022 --> 20:26.626
probably several people,
including us.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.329
Just-just let 'em be, please?

20:29.362 --> 20:30.430
I beg you.

20:30.463 --> 20:33.533
Okay, I'll stop. I promise.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.302
Is that a for real promise?

20:35.335 --> 20:37.337
Not the kind of promise
where you say one thing

20:37.370 --> 20:38.538
and then do something else?

20:40.507 --> 20:41.608
Fine, I promise.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.410
All right.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.846
Now if you'll excuse me,
I lost my appetite.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.619
(sighs)

21:00.393 --> 21:01.761
Yep, that is
some shiner, kid.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.364
Yeah, just in time
for school photo day, too.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.333
Yee-haw.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.035
Well, I think he looks
like a tough guy.
Oh, great.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.604
Why don't you take him
to get a tattoo, why don't ya?

21:11.638 --> 21:13.773
Maybe an anchor on one arm,
a mermaid on the other.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.775
Really? I can get a tattoo?

21:15.808 --> 21:17.544
No!

21:17.577 --> 21:20.480
You're tough enough, kiddo.
You get that from your mama.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.349
WINIFRED:
Did someone say dessert?
Why, yes,

21:22.382 --> 21:23.816
they did, and it was me.
Come on.
Yeah, uh...

21:23.850 --> 21:25.051
Apple crumble's calling.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.754
Mm-hmm. Wade, I'm gonna show you
something over here in the...

21:27.787 --> 21:29.522
There's this real
interesting part
of the woods

21:29.556 --> 21:30.657
where there are
no other people.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.492
Yeah.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.568
What are you doing? I thought
we were building a bridge.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.670
I'm trying, all right?

21:43.703 --> 21:45.538
Old Chuck over there keeps
dynamiting it.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.607
Okay, new strategy.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.776
Why don't you just try
and keep your distance?

21:49.809 --> 21:51.611
Sounds good to me.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.551
Trouble in paradise?

21:58.585 --> 22:00.587
Oh, just boys being boys.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.089
Oh, tell me about it. It's
always a pissing contest.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.691
Young boys, old boys,
you name it.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.826
That's why I just tabled
the entire gender.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.127
I'm starting
to see the wisdom

22:08.160 --> 22:09.896
in that decision.
Mm.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.564
Well, I-I-I don't understand.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.500
Is this a new feature
of the practice?

22:13.533 --> 22:15.134
It's like
an enhanced house call?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.437
Dr. Breeland sent you
here to...?

22:17.470 --> 22:18.838
To personally escort you
to Mobile Memorial.

22:18.871 --> 22:19.906
He would do it himself,

22:19.939 --> 22:22.642
but he is very,
very, very busy.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.111
That is three verys,
and apparently

22:25.144 --> 22:26.379
I'm bad cop this week, so...

22:26.413 --> 22:31.618
I-I-I appreciate the service,
but u-un-unfortunately, um...

22:31.651 --> 22:32.719
I can't go.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.821
Oh, no, you can.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.523
Get in.
I will drive.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.124
Wait. You see,
the problem is...
What?

22:38.157 --> 22:39.726
I've never driven
with you before.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.729
I'm a very safe driver.
Mr. Polk, I am gonna lose it!

22:42.762 --> 22:44.897
Wait. (chuckles)

22:44.931 --> 22:46.633
Could-could we maybe just have
a cold drink first?

22:46.666 --> 22:48.568
A cold drink?

22:48.601 --> 22:50.603
Some iced tea?

22:50.637 --> 22:52.739
You know, (sighs)
to calm me down.

22:52.772 --> 22:55.642
Okay, one glass of iced tea.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.143
On the porch.

22:57.176 --> 22:59.145
'Cause I do not go
into patients' houses.

22:59.178 --> 23:00.480
It's a serial killer thing.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.948
I watch a lot of CBS.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.383
Okay, one second.

23:05.718 --> 23:10.156
All right, all right, people,
it is zero hour!

23:10.189 --> 23:11.691
Time for Capture the Wilkes!

23:11.724 --> 23:13.526
It's like, it's like
Capture the Flag,

23:13.560 --> 23:14.427
only it's more competitive

23:14.461 --> 23:15.895
and there's
the occasional booby trap.

23:15.928 --> 23:16.696
All right.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.699
Okay, so Vivian,
Miles, and Henry,

23:19.732 --> 23:23.603
and all the Fairhope Wilkes,
you're with Daryl, mm-hmm.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.572
And Harley and
Charles and Wade

23:25.605 --> 23:28.174
and the Daphne Wilkes
are with me.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.610
Come on.
Uh, no-no swaps.

23:30.643 --> 23:33.513
The teams are scientifically
calculated, so...

23:33.546 --> 23:34.981
See you on the other side.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.516
All right.

23:36.549 --> 23:37.784
Okay, assignments.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.919
Uh, Harley and Sue,
you're my Little Sneakers

23:39.952 --> 23:41.688
'cause you're little
and sneaky, okay?

23:41.721 --> 23:44.190
You're gonna be bringing back
the other team's flag.

23:44.223 --> 23:47.927
Charles and Wade,
you're my two-man recon team.

23:47.960 --> 23:51.664
Stick together and handle
prisoner retrieval. Got it?

23:51.698 --> 23:53.199
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
that I, like,

23:53.232 --> 23:54.266
I don't know, hang back?

23:54.300 --> 23:57.203
CHARLES:
Yeah, you know,
maybe send me with Harley.

23:57.236 --> 23:59.906
You know, long-standing
tradition of father
and son and all.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.608
That's two complaints.

24:01.641 --> 24:04.210
There will not be a third,
understand?

24:04.243 --> 24:04.944
Clear?

24:04.977 --> 24:06.613
Clear.
Crystal.

24:06.646 --> 24:07.914
Oh, good.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.819
Flowers? Oh, this is unexpected.

24:12.852 --> 24:15.588
Flowers for George Tucker?

24:15.622 --> 24:17.624
Someone sent me flowers?

24:17.657 --> 24:18.691
There's a note.

24:18.725 --> 24:19.826
Oh, thank you.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.828
You have a nice day.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.832
"Please give me
a second chance."

24:25.865 --> 24:27.634
"Dinner tonight?
Le Pain..."

24:27.667 --> 24:30.236
"...Perdu, Mobile."

24:30.269 --> 24:31.237
"George."

24:31.270 --> 24:32.605
"Lemon."

24:33.840 --> 24:35.675
Thank you very much.

24:35.708 --> 24:36.676
(chuckles)

24:36.709 --> 24:38.778
Any time.
Have yourself
a nice day now.

24:47.587 --> 24:50.256
Hi. Can I have
a Scotch, neat?

24:50.289 --> 24:52.491
(chuckles)
Thank you.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.267
Wow.

25:01.300 --> 25:02.802
Lemon. (laughs)

25:02.835 --> 25:03.903
George.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.038
Who would have thought
that we'd be having dinner,

25:06.072 --> 25:08.608
just the two of us, like this?

25:08.641 --> 25:11.077
Well, certainly not me,

25:11.110 --> 25:13.546
but life is full of surprises,
isn't it?

25:13.580 --> 25:14.881
That it is.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.316
Your table is ready, sir.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.985
Great.
After you.

25:28.127 --> 25:30.897
You're kidding.
A shark did that?

25:30.930 --> 25:32.799
They got skin like sandpaper.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.801
You're supposed to keep
your limbs in the cage,

25:34.834 --> 25:37.303
but when I saw that thing
swim by, I thought...

25:37.336 --> 25:39.906
When am I gonna get another
chance to pet a tiger shark?

25:39.939 --> 25:40.807
Exactly.

25:40.840 --> 25:45.011
I don't get you.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.846
Diving in shark cages?

25:46.879 --> 25:48.781
Only, like, three or four times.

25:48.815 --> 25:51.751
But you're terrified of getting
your blood test.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.727
Davis, I get
that you're worried,

26:00.760 --> 26:03.062
but can I just say
there is such

26:03.095 --> 26:07.066
a very good chance that they're
not gonna find anything.

26:07.099 --> 26:10.903
Oh, I know they're not gonna
find anything.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.739
'Cause you're not sick.

26:12.772 --> 26:15.041
I'm not.

26:15.074 --> 26:18.745
I, um...

26:18.778 --> 26:20.613
I made it all up.

26:22.882 --> 26:26.619
I-I kept going in there
to see you.

26:26.653 --> 26:27.820
To ask you out.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.690
Every time I...

26:30.723 --> 26:34.861
I walked in,
I lost my nerve, so...

26:34.894 --> 26:37.163
And it's not-not like I could,
you know,

26:37.196 --> 26:41.868
put on that stupid
knight's costume back on.

26:43.069 --> 26:48.675
The knight who bought me a drink
at the Renaissance fair?

26:48.708 --> 26:49.976
That was you?

26:50.009 --> 26:53.780
I only had the armor
for 24 hours.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.717
(sighs)

26:59.886 --> 27:01.120
I scared you off.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.789
No, uh, no.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.692
I just...

27:05.725 --> 27:09.028
Overwhelmed me, maybe.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.397
Uh, I should go.

27:11.430 --> 27:12.665
I... Yeah.

27:18.705 --> 27:20.406
Do you remember
our first dinner?

27:20.439 --> 27:21.908
I do, I do.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.676
A drive-through
outside of Lillian.

27:23.710 --> 27:26.913
(laughs)
You split your cheese fries
with me.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.715
Yeah, well, you were wearing
a cheerleader outfit.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.416
I would have split
my bank account with you.

27:30.449 --> 27:31.718
(both laugh)

27:33.786 --> 27:35.021
What are you
doing here?!

27:35.054 --> 27:37.690
The relevant question is, what
are Lemon and George doing here

27:37.724 --> 27:38.791
after you promised me?

27:38.825 --> 27:42.028
Shh! Move! I don't want them
to see you. Sit down!

27:42.061 --> 27:44.230
I will sit down for a second.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.798
Then you're gonna go over there

27:45.832 --> 27:47.734
and tell them what you did
or I will.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.435
No, you can't! Come on.

27:49.468 --> 27:52.171
Look at them.
They're having a great time.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.841
LEMON (laughs):
Do you remember when my father
walked in on us?

27:54.874 --> 27:55.875
I know, I know!
I thought

27:55.908 --> 27:58.177
I'd never be able
to look Brick in
the eye again.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.246
And then my mom, the next day,
decided to take me

28:00.279 --> 28:02.181
to see Dr. Wilkes
for some shots, and your dad

28:02.214 --> 28:03.182
was covering for him.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.450
Oh! We were so young.

28:04.483 --> 28:05.918
So stupid.

28:05.952 --> 28:06.719
So happy.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.958
Okay, they may be
having fun, but it's only

28:11.991 --> 28:13.259
because they're here
under false pretenses.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.261
Or maybe it's
because they like each other.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.463
Everybody in town had
to take shifts as buffers

28:17.496 --> 28:18.965
to keep them from killing
each other

28:18.998 --> 28:20.466
when they were opening Fancie's!

28:20.499 --> 28:22.201
Well, maybe they pick at each
other because they don't want

28:22.234 --> 28:23.803
to show their true feelings.

28:23.836 --> 28:26.505
They don't have true feelings!
They have a little voice

28:26.538 --> 28:27.874
in their head, and eventually

28:27.907 --> 28:29.742
they're gonna find out
that voice is you.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.778
Well, they will thank me
at their next wedding.

28:31.811 --> 28:34.013
(groans)

28:36.248 --> 28:38.284
Well, you know what?
The special

28:38.317 --> 28:41.253
sounds amazing.
And since it is a special night,

28:41.287 --> 28:43.055
I'll have that.

28:43.089 --> 28:43.890
Lemon?

28:43.923 --> 28:47.493
Um, I will have the salmon,
please.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.195
WAITER:
Lovely choice.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.997
(clears throat)

28:51.030 --> 28:54.200
What? What's that look
on your face for?

28:54.233 --> 28:55.401
No reason, no reason.

28:55.434 --> 28:58.004
Just, you know, every time
you order fish at a restaurant,

28:58.037 --> 28:59.505
you end up
sending it back, so...

28:59.538 --> 29:02.809
Well, tonight I won't.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.011
Okay, tonight you won't.

29:05.044 --> 29:08.280
They're not gonna
make it to dessert.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.951
(twigs snap loudly)

29:11.984 --> 29:14.120
Hey, Roadhouse,
walk a little louder,
why don't you?

29:14.153 --> 29:15.922
You know, enough
with the "Roadhouse,"
all right?

29:15.955 --> 29:17.056
Have you even seen
that movie?

29:17.089 --> 29:18.124
Yeah, I've seen
the movie.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.926
See, I don't think
you have.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.961
'Cause if you had,
you'd realize that
calling me Roadhouse

29:21.994 --> 29:23.796
is actually kind
of a compliment.

29:23.830 --> 29:26.799
See, in the movie,
Patrick Swayze's Dalton
is not only a bouncer,

29:26.833 --> 29:30.269
but he's a philosopher,
a college grad, a tai chi
master and a mediator.

29:30.302 --> 29:33.139
Not to mention that he
tears people's throats
out for a living.

29:33.172 --> 29:34.807
So you know what?
Thank you.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.976
Look, all I'm saying
is, the way

29:37.009 --> 29:37.977
you're tromping through
the woods,

29:38.010 --> 29:40.179
there's a good chance
someone from the blue team

29:40.212 --> 29:41.247
still hasn't heard us.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.182
I wouldn't worry
too much about it,

29:43.215 --> 29:44.917
because, actually, the
sound of your whining

29:44.951 --> 29:46.152
is drowning out my footsteps.

29:46.185 --> 29:49.321
Shh. Stop. You hear that?

29:49.355 --> 29:54.827
Yeah. That's what we overgrown
juveniles like to call a rabbit.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.897
Okay, well, my instincts
tell me that we should go back.

29:57.930 --> 29:58.898
Oh, is that the same instinct

29:58.931 --> 30:00.332
that told you to put on
that shirt this morning?

30:00.366 --> 30:02.568
This is a good shirt.

30:02.601 --> 30:05.171
Not every guy can pull off pink.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.206
Right. You keep telling yourself
that. I'm going this way.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.180
Wha...

30:14.213 --> 30:16.215
(gasps)

30:17.884 --> 30:20.219
Well, I guess
that's some smart rabbit.

30:20.252 --> 30:21.820
Shut up.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.896
And you know, I don't care
what anyone says,

30:29.929 --> 30:32.098
that Wes Anderson is like
the Emperor's New Clothes of

30:32.131 --> 30:33.933
movie directors. I just don't
understand a single word.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.201
I'll tell you what, Lemon.
You have given me

30:35.234 --> 30:36.235
so many
movie reviews tonight,

30:36.268 --> 30:37.870
you barely touched
your salmon.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.338
Are you sure you don't want
to send it back?

30:39.371 --> 30:40.339
'Cause you can.

30:40.372 --> 30:43.242
Not at all! (laughs)

30:48.380 --> 30:50.016
Hey! Hi!

30:50.049 --> 30:52.251
Excuse me.
Could you go over
to the table

30:52.284 --> 30:54.353
over there and play
your most romantic song?

30:54.386 --> 30:56.022
Okay.
No.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.958
No more interfering.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.627
But...
Watch and learn,

31:01.660 --> 31:04.263
my friend. Watch and learn.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.401
Hello, how is everything?

31:09.435 --> 31:12.438
Shall I take away the salmon?

31:12.471 --> 31:15.374
Uh, no, not at all. I'm enjoying
every single little bite.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.276
(chuckles)
Thank you.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.646
Okay, Lemon, you do not have

31:20.679 --> 31:22.949
to eat the salmon for me.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.450
What? I love the salmon.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.252
It's, um, phenomenal.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.154
I just had a big lunch, so...

31:28.187 --> 31:29.956
You can barely swallow it.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.190
Yes, I can.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.161
(laughs)

31:36.295 --> 31:38.197
Yeah.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.066
Exactly. Look at you, Lemon.
You hate it.

31:40.099 --> 31:43.235
Okay, fine. I hate it.
All right?

31:43.269 --> 31:45.004
But how was I supposed
to know that the fish

31:45.037 --> 31:46.038
was gonna be so fishy?!

31:46.072 --> 31:47.039
Because it's fish!

31:47.073 --> 31:48.407
If you don't like fish,

31:48.440 --> 31:50.409
you don't order the fish!
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:50.442 --> 31:52.411
I forgot I was out with
the ordering police.
What?!

31:52.444 --> 31:54.013
LEMON:
Okay, Mr. Judgey.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.147
It just so happens that salmon,

31:55.181 --> 31:56.282
if prepared properly,

31:56.315 --> 31:57.683
is not supposed to taste fishy.

31:57.716 --> 31:58.784
And who are you to criticize?

31:58.817 --> 32:00.686
Because, as a man with
borderline high cholesterol,

32:00.719 --> 32:03.022
that lamb was
a very dangerous choice!

32:03.055 --> 32:04.690
Okay, my cholesterol?
None of your business.

32:04.723 --> 32:07.026
Okay, clearly this was
a huge mistake.
Enormous.

32:07.059 --> 32:07.859
Okay, you know, if I had known

32:07.893 --> 32:09.228
that you were gonna be
such a boar,

32:09.261 --> 32:10.429
I wouldn't have accepted
your invitation.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.198
Nice try. You invited me here.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.399
I most certainly did not.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.301
Oh, we should probably go.

32:15.334 --> 32:16.302
(gasps)

32:16.335 --> 32:20.072
(crashes loudly)

32:29.348 --> 32:31.017
Zoe.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.719
Of course.

32:33.752 --> 32:35.721
Oh, oh, it's my fault?

32:35.754 --> 32:36.989
Well, how-how do
you figure that?

32:37.023 --> 32:40.026
Because I've played Capture the
Wilkes for the last ten years,

32:40.059 --> 32:42.061
and the only time
I get stuck in a net

32:42.094 --> 32:43.729
is the time I'm with you.

32:43.762 --> 32:44.963
That doesn't prove anything.

32:44.997 --> 32:47.499
Because 100% of the time that
I've been teamed up with you

32:47.533 --> 32:50.336
in this dumb-ass game,
I've ended up in a net.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.238
You're an idiot.

32:52.271 --> 32:54.240
What is wrong with you, man?
Seriously.

32:54.273 --> 32:56.475
I mean, you can't possibly
be like this all the time

32:56.508 --> 32:58.477
or the Vivian I know
never would've married you.

32:58.510 --> 32:59.278
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.047
What-what the hell
does that mean?

33:02.281 --> 33:03.749
Look, Charles.

33:03.782 --> 33:06.152
I am sorry that Harley ended up
with a black eye.

33:06.185 --> 33:09.355
I am out of practice dispensing
advice to eight-year-olds.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.157
But... but I just,

33:11.190 --> 33:13.292
I just want the kid
to like me, okay?

33:16.128 --> 33:17.496
How-how do you think it feels
that the one time

33:17.529 --> 33:19.298
he comes to me for advice,

33:19.331 --> 33:22.134
he ends up with a black eye?

33:24.803 --> 33:27.506
Well, how do you think it feels
that my kid

33:27.539 --> 33:29.375
has to go the new guy
in his life

33:29.408 --> 33:32.511
who-who works at a bar

33:32.544 --> 33:34.046
and drives a truck and...

33:34.080 --> 33:35.447
rips people's throats out

33:35.481 --> 33:36.782
whenever they...
I am not a bouncer!

33:36.815 --> 33:39.518
All right? Watch the damn movie!

33:39.551 --> 33:41.287
HARLEY:
Are you guys fighting?

33:41.320 --> 33:42.788
Harley!
Hey!

33:42.821 --> 33:43.822
Hey, little man?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.324
You think you could lend us
a hand here, bud?

33:45.357 --> 33:47.025
Maybe grab us a ladder?

33:50.829 --> 33:52.364
Brick.

33:52.398 --> 33:53.199
What's going on?

33:53.232 --> 33:55.501
So, how did
Davis Polk's test go?

33:55.534 --> 33:57.069
I never heard from you.

33:57.103 --> 33:59.805
That's 'cause we never
made it to Mobile.

33:59.838 --> 34:01.273
Oh, no, no, no.
We need to find out

34:01.307 --> 34:02.541
what is wrong
with that young man.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.810
Nothing.
Nothing is wrong with him.

34:04.843 --> 34:06.812
I mean, I was right.
He was faking it.

34:06.845 --> 34:08.614
He told me so himself, so...

34:08.647 --> 34:10.449
Faking it? Really?
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.318
So, did he tell you

34:12.351 --> 34:14.820
he loved you yet?

34:14.853 --> 34:16.822
You knew?

34:16.855 --> 34:18.324
Well, of course I knew.
The man had 14 appointments

34:18.357 --> 34:19.625
in one month.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.827
I just don't see
how you didn't know.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.329
(sighs)
I...

34:23.362 --> 34:25.331
You don't think
I should go out with him?

34:25.364 --> 34:26.431
Why not?

34:26.465 --> 34:28.467
He's... he's just shy.

34:30.668 --> 34:33.572
What if I'm just, uh,

34:33.605 --> 34:37.176
not in a place
to like anyone right now?

34:41.913 --> 34:44.550
What if?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.385
You're never gonna know

34:46.418 --> 34:49.255
unless you try.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.290
(quiet laugh)

34:54.293 --> 34:55.893
I should seriously have
a restraining order against you!
What is wrong with you?!

34:55.927 --> 34:57.329
You are perhaps the saddest,
most misguided person

34:57.363 --> 34:58.464
I've ever met
Why do you keep butting

34:58.497 --> 34:59.631
into my love life?!
in my entire life!

34:59.665 --> 35:01.133
Oh, come on, now
cut her some slack!

35:01.167 --> 35:02.468
She just had a breakup.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.203
She's not in her right mind.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.871
I am so in my right mind!

35:05.904 --> 35:07.339
Look, this could've worked!

35:07.373 --> 35:08.407
You were one piece of fish away

35:08.440 --> 35:10.476
from having a great night,
getting back together,

35:10.509 --> 35:12.311
and fixing all of our problems.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.580
What...
what is she talking about?

35:14.613 --> 35:15.881
You don't want to know.

35:15.914 --> 35:17.349
We're cursed.

35:17.383 --> 35:18.350
What?

35:18.384 --> 35:19.685
And now you do.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.487
Don't you see?
Ever since you two

35:21.520 --> 35:24.223
didn't walk down the aisle,
none of us have been able

35:24.256 --> 35:25.224
to have
a meaningful relationship.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.593
You need to set things right.
(laughs): Yeah.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.195
Did she see Madame Van Horn?

35:29.228 --> 35:30.362
Yup.
Zoe...

35:30.396 --> 35:32.398
that woman is a quack.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.300
Okay? I currently got
four active law suits

35:34.333 --> 35:35.401
open against her.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.403
Sad.

35:37.436 --> 35:38.504
Just sad.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.306
But in good news, I feel

35:40.339 --> 35:43.242
too sorry for you to be angry.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.180
Well...

35:48.214 --> 35:49.415
you're wrong!

35:49.448 --> 35:51.317
We're cursed!

35:51.350 --> 35:53.419
I know we're cursed.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.321
That's the only reason
that would explain

35:55.354 --> 35:57.423
why Joel is gone, right?

36:00.959 --> 36:02.561
Oh, Zoe...

36:14.440 --> 36:16.275
Hey, Wade, check it out!

36:16.308 --> 36:18.477
It's the Capture the Wilkes
winner's trophy.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.279
Our names are on it.
Really?

36:20.312 --> 36:21.680
Yeah, all of them.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.683
Well, would you look at that?

36:24.716 --> 36:26.485
Right under the POWs.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.954
(Wade chuckles)
Can I show Wanda the trophy?

36:28.987 --> 36:30.589
Yeah, of course you can, man.
She's in the kitchen.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.958
Go check her out.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.260
So, look,

36:34.293 --> 36:35.961
I guess I'm just, you know,

36:35.994 --> 36:36.995
trying to get used to the idea

36:37.028 --> 36:39.598
that there is another man
in my family's life.

36:40.732 --> 36:41.700
But if it has

36:41.733 --> 36:43.502
to be someone...

36:43.535 --> 36:45.571
you know...

36:45.604 --> 36:48.274
You can't bring yourself
to say it, can you?

36:48.307 --> 36:50.509
I'm working on it.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.312
Good enough.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.451
AnnaBeth.

36:59.485 --> 37:01.587
My answer is yes.

37:03.021 --> 37:06.492
I would, I would be happy
to go on a date with you.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.994
You-You're-you're
letting me off the hook.

37:09.027 --> 37:11.797
I haven't even
officially asked you out yet.

37:11.830 --> 37:15.334
Well, go ahead then.

37:18.504 --> 37:20.005
Wou...?

37:20.038 --> 37:22.441
AnnaBeth, will you...

37:23.475 --> 37:25.744
...go out with me?

37:27.413 --> 37:30.516
Well, usually there's
a specific date and time.

37:30.549 --> 37:33.018
Like... dinner tonight?

37:33.051 --> 37:35.354
Oh, God, I would love to,

37:35.387 --> 37:37.456
but I have this, um...

37:37.489 --> 37:39.658
Is there any chance you'd want

37:39.691 --> 37:42.761
to go to this-this black-tie
fund-raiser thing with me?

37:42.794 --> 37:45.531
Black-tie? I would love to.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.033
See? How hard was that?

37:48.066 --> 37:49.535
(both laugh)

37:49.568 --> 37:51.570
I will pick you up at 7:00.

37:51.603 --> 37:52.771
Yes, you will.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.773
Oh, who's the fund-raiser for,
by the way?

37:54.806 --> 37:57.042
Oh, is it
some shark-hunting expedition?

37:57.075 --> 37:58.777
(laughs)
Well, that depends
on who you ask.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.346
It's-it's for my uncle.

38:00.379 --> 38:01.580
Oh.
His reelection campaign.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.549
He's the mayor of Fillmore.

38:03.582 --> 38:04.583
Mayor Gainey?

38:04.616 --> 38:05.551
Yeah.

38:05.584 --> 38:06.518
Is your uncle?

38:06.552 --> 38:07.653
That's right.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.521
(laughs)
Well,

38:09.555 --> 38:10.822
sounds like

38:10.856 --> 38:12.724
a really interesting evening.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.660
So I am in.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.662
Great! All right.
Okay.

38:16.695 --> 38:17.529
Bye.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.565
Okay, bye.
Bye!

38:22.401 --> 38:24.403
(door opens)

38:37.583 --> 38:39.518
What are you doing?

38:39.551 --> 38:42.388
Packing up Joel's stuff.

38:42.421 --> 38:44.523
Ah.

38:44.556 --> 38:47.393
I miss him.

38:47.426 --> 38:48.494
But you were right.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.396
He didn't leave
because we were cursed.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.499
No.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.534
I mean,
I-I could have gone to L.A.

38:55.567 --> 38:58.370
or to London,
but I chose not to.

38:58.404 --> 38:59.838
We could be together right now.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.641
But I just couldn't.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.843
It was me.

39:04.876 --> 39:07.112
Yeah, but you wouldn't
have liked it.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.780
I mean, all that sun.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.483
Followed by all that fog.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.620
You belong here.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.825
What if I made
the biggest mistake

39:19.858 --> 39:22.127
of my life,

39:22.160 --> 39:25.464
and let the right person
just walk away forever?

39:26.632 --> 39:27.833
Yeah, I think about that

39:27.866 --> 39:30.736
every day.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.938
It doesn't mean
that I didn't love him.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.139
No.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.641
Definitely not.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.375
Because-because I did.
I loved him so much.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.627
Hello, Lemon.

39:55.661 --> 39:57.663
(laughs)
Hello, George.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.498
Hi. I, uh,

39:59.531 --> 40:00.899
I just wanted to say

40:00.932 --> 40:03.869
that the other night?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.637
It was amazing.

40:05.671 --> 40:07.606
It was.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.741
Yes, and I should
have told you that

40:09.775 --> 40:11.877
the morning after.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.178
And then I should have told you

40:13.211 --> 40:15.180
that it was a mistake.

40:15.213 --> 40:16.948
Because...
Because it was!

40:16.982 --> 40:19.184
Yeah, yeah, I mean, if I
would've just told you then...

40:19.217 --> 40:20.619
Then we could've avoided
Zoe Hart's

40:20.652 --> 40:21.687
ridiculous matchmaking scheme.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.589
Exactly, exactly.

40:23.622 --> 40:24.923
Yes.
And

40:24.956 --> 40:27.493
as far as last night goes,

40:27.526 --> 40:29.495
I also wanted
to apologize for that.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.797
I was a jerk.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.999
I don't know why, I don't know
what it is about you

40:34.032 --> 40:37.536
that drives me... so crazy.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.805
(laughs): Oh.

40:39.838 --> 40:43.675
But you and I have to figure out

40:43.709 --> 40:45.777
a way to get past that,
you know,

40:45.811 --> 40:47.679
because we own
a business together now.

40:47.713 --> 40:48.847
We do, we do.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.215
And if there's one thing
that I've learned

40:50.248 --> 40:51.817
about owning a business,
it's that

40:51.850 --> 40:53.619
you have to keep
your personal life

40:53.652 --> 40:54.986
and your business life
completely separate

40:55.020 --> 40:56.555
because if you don't,
 then everything...

40:56.588 --> 40:58.590
(Lemon's voice fades out)

41:02.561 --> 41:03.829
...you can recover
from that very...

41:03.862 --> 41:04.896
Hello?

41:05.864 --> 41:06.998
George?

41:07.032 --> 41:09.901
Tha... uh, yes.
Why do you have

41:09.935 --> 41:11.703
that dopey look on your face?
Are you even listening to me?

41:11.737 --> 41:14.973
Oh, yes, yes, I am.
I completely am.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.608
I was just...
you know, I just...

41:16.642 --> 41:18.644
I had a thought that, uh,

41:18.677 --> 41:21.713
you know, maybe the best way for
us to handle this going forward

41:21.747 --> 41:25.250
is for me to be more
of a silent partner, you know?

41:25.283 --> 41:27.586
The restaurant,
this whole thing?

41:27.619 --> 41:29.287
That's-that's more,
that's more you, so...

41:29.320 --> 41:31.923
Yeah, well,

41:31.957 --> 41:34.492
I mean, that'd be fine.

41:35.961 --> 41:38.664
Are you sure?

41:38.697 --> 41:40.298
100% sure, yes.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.100
I am.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.604
Well, okay.

41:45.637 --> 41:46.605
Okay.

41:46.638 --> 41:47.806
(laughs)

41:47.839 --> 41:49.040
Great.
