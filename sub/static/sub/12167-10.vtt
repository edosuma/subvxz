00:01.506 --> 00:06.761
They are called the Genii. They are simple
people, but good farmers and fair traders.

00:06.928 --> 00:11.391
- They look friendly enough.
- I have often traded with Tyrus.

00:11.558 --> 00:14.394
I'm bringing them in.
All operations to silent mode.

00:15.645 --> 00:20.066
If people could just learn to keep
their secret underground hatches locked.

00:20.233 --> 00:22.736
So, the whole farmer thing is just a front.

00:22.902 --> 00:26.656
- The next culling was decades away.
- We're looking for allies.

00:26.823 --> 00:30.827
We had hoped to test our first
atomic weapon five years from now.

00:30.994 --> 00:34.205
- Do we have that much time, Sheppard?
- No.

00:34.372 --> 00:36.708
How does a Wraith ship's computer
help you?

00:36.875 --> 00:40.253
This interface device
shows the location of Wraith ships.

00:40.420 --> 00:44.966
- You know where to deliver bombs.
- The Wraith must not know we were here.

00:45.133 --> 00:46.593
- Help!
- Leave him!

00:46.760 --> 00:48.470
<i>- Please!
- (shouts)</i>

00:52.557 --> 00:55.268
- Where's my father?
- He did not survive.

00:55.435 --> 00:58.271
By leaving him to die,
it's as if you killed him.

00:58.438 --> 01:01.566
You do not want to make an enemy
of the Genii.

01:14.496 --> 01:17.916
Haven't been to the mainland in a while.
How's everybody doing?

01:18.083 --> 01:21.419
Halling believes the first crops
will have a good yield.

01:21.586 --> 01:23.254
You still miss home?

01:23.421 --> 01:26.091
There is still talk of returning,

01:26.257 --> 01:30.261
even though the Wraith have scorched
Athos in revenge for our resistance.

01:30.428 --> 01:35.225
Maybe in time this place
will begin to feel like home.

01:35.392 --> 01:38.228
Do you see that?

01:39.104 --> 01:43.817
That can't be a storm.
It stretches across the whole horizon.

01:43.983 --> 01:46.444
I've never seen that from so high.

01:46.611 --> 01:49.531
I've seen a lot from this altitude,
but not that.

01:52.492 --> 01:56.913
This is Jumper One. We're changing
our heading to investigate a storm.

01:57.080 --> 02:01.209
Major, this is Weir. We didn't copy that.
You're breaking up.

02:01.376 --> 02:03.670
<i>(Sheppard) I said there's...</i>

02:03.837 --> 02:07.173
<i>- (static)
...weather forecasting.</i>

02:10.175 --> 02:12.637
Did he just say weather forecasting?

02:24.024 --> 02:27.485
- Do all storms look like this from above?
- No.

02:27.652 --> 02:30.739
This must cover 20% of the planet.

02:30.905 --> 02:36.244
- Is it headed towards the mainland?
- Tracking towards the settlement.

02:37.871 --> 02:40.415
And after that?

02:42.500 --> 02:44.586
Straight to Atlantis.

03:54.614 --> 03:57.909
<i>(McKay) This planet
is basically the same size as Earth.</i>

03:58.076 --> 04:00.995
Hurricanes on Earth
never get as big as this boy

04:01.162 --> 04:03.665
because once they hit the shore
they slow down.

04:03.832 --> 04:08.795
Without as much land mass to slow
it down here, it's gaining momentum.

04:08.962 --> 04:11.881
- Both of them are.
- Both of them?

04:12.048 --> 04:15.260
- We saw only one.
- It only looked like one.

04:15.427 --> 04:20.473
According to the Ancient database, every
20 or 30 years the sea gets very warm.

04:20.640 --> 04:25.270
That, for rather boring reasons, means
hurricanes are more likely to occur.

04:25.437 --> 04:29.315
- Like El NiÃ±o, the ocean...
- Like I said, rather boring.

04:29.482 --> 04:34.195
- Focus.
- If there are a bunch of hurricanes,

04:34.362 --> 04:37.032
the likelihood of two colliding
is increased.

04:37.198 --> 04:41.327
It's more like a merger. They are
intersecting and combining their power.

04:41.494 --> 04:44.581
And... it's headed right towards us.

04:44.748 --> 04:49.044
You said the Ancients experienced
these storms every 20 to 30 years.

04:49.210 --> 04:51.546
Atlantis must have some precautions.

04:51.713 --> 04:56.259
The Ancients were protected by the shield
or submerged deep enough in the water.

04:56.426 --> 05:00.305
OK. Strike those options.
What else have we got?

05:00.472 --> 05:05.143
Nothing. It is a real threat.
The high winds alone will wreak havoc.

05:05.310 --> 05:09.022
Come on, guys.
This city's been around for a long time.

05:09.189 --> 05:10.899
Storm surge is inevitable.

05:11.066 --> 05:17.322
By moving over a land mass before hitting
us, there is a greater risk of tornadoes.

05:17.489 --> 05:19.616
This is Atlantis.

05:19.783 --> 05:24.704
They've gotta be able
to handle that... right?

05:24.871 --> 05:27.832
- No.
- Why not?

05:27.999 --> 05:30.752
The people who built this city
had a force field

05:30.919 --> 05:34.589
capable of holding back anything
nature or the Wraith threw at them.

05:34.756 --> 05:38.510
Without that protection,
Atlantis is remarkably fragile.

05:38.677 --> 05:42.305
Even our conservative calculations
project widespread damage.

05:42.472 --> 05:47.769
- Flooding could sink the city.
- How could something this big just sink?

05:47.936 --> 05:52.857
<i>- The Titanic's passengers asked that too.
- Yes, well, let's not.</i>

05:54.275 --> 05:58.738
What you're saying is
if Teyla and I hadn't discovered this...

05:58.905 --> 06:03.243
We would be in even bigger trouble.

06:04.202 --> 06:10.041
- What's the plan?
- We have 12 hours until the storm hits.

06:10.208 --> 06:13.545
So... we plan to have a plan...

06:13.712 --> 06:16.589
- Yeah.
...by then.

06:20.343 --> 06:24.889
We start investigating evacuation plans,
both on the mainland and offworld.

06:25.056 --> 06:29.019
McKay will come up with something.
He's setting himself up to be a hero.

06:29.185 --> 06:33.231
Maybe Rodney is, but Dr Zelenka
seemed genuinely concerned.

06:33.398 --> 06:37.485
So, I find a friendly planet that
wouldn't mind putting us up for the night?

06:37.652 --> 06:41.072
Exactly. Take Ford,
see what you can work out.

06:50.373 --> 06:52.667
I don't have the right boots for this.

06:52.834 --> 06:55.837
I was just meant to come
and inoculate some wee babies.

06:56.004 --> 06:58.757
We need all the hands we can spare
before it comes.

06:58.923 --> 07:02.469
The storm could destroy our settlement
as well as our crops.

07:02.635 --> 07:07.432
- If a few of us remained...
- Homes can be rebuilt. People can't.

07:07.599 --> 07:11.061
Which is why we must do
what we can now.

07:26.534 --> 07:29.746
The entire population of Atlantis.

07:29.913 --> 07:32.457
At most, yes.

07:32.624 --> 07:35.919
Only for a day. Two at most.

07:36.086 --> 07:41.091
We are happy to trade with you
for a share of our crops, but this...

07:41.257 --> 07:45.512
I know it's a lot to ask, but... I'm asking.

07:47.013 --> 07:49.099
What do you offer in return?

07:49.265 --> 07:51.935
I guess we'd owe you one.

07:52.102 --> 07:56.064
- One what?
- A favour.

07:58.358 --> 08:01.820
We're in trouble.
If you're a friend, you'll help.

08:01.986 --> 08:04.572
If not, tell me now
so I can ask somebody else.

08:04.739 --> 08:08.535
But who else would take in so many?

08:11.996 --> 08:15.041
I want something of value in return.

08:15.208 --> 08:17.502
Oh, you do, do you?

08:17.669 --> 08:21.047
We can go find any uninhabited planet.

08:21.214 --> 08:23.466
They're usually uninhabited for a reason.

08:23.633 --> 08:26.594
You know that, or you would not be here.

08:26.761 --> 08:31.016
Still, I'm sure you could find
another world to take you in.

08:31.182 --> 08:33.977
You're just so short on time.

08:34.144 --> 08:38.898
One day you're gonna run across
a problem and need our help.

08:40.066 --> 08:43.403
- Isn't that right, Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

08:43.570 --> 08:48.366
And we've got lots of ships and weapons
we can help with.

08:50.577 --> 08:55.623
- You're saying we can be your friends or...
- I much prefer friends.

08:55.790 --> 08:58.126
That is of value to me.

09:03.089 --> 09:06.885
One night. Two, tops.
We bring our own blankets.

09:08.762 --> 09:14.809
- Very well. You may send your people.
- This won't be forgotten.

09:14.976 --> 09:17.854
I'll go back, tell everybody the good news.

09:18.021 --> 09:22.817
- We'll send word once we know more.
- I look forward to it.

09:34.829 --> 09:37.415
- I thought of that.
- He may be on to something.

09:37.582 --> 09:39.876
I've already thought of it. It doesn't...

09:40.043 --> 09:43.380
The naquadah generators
could power sections of the city,

09:43.546 --> 09:48.343
but some areas need to be secure, so
not much power is left for anything else.

09:48.510 --> 09:51.846
- The city breaks apart...
- We could relocate some of them.

09:52.013 --> 09:55.016
If only we had a magical tool
that could slow down time.

09:55.183 --> 09:57.268
I left mine on Earth. What about you?

09:57.435 --> 10:00.689
You're not pleasant
when you're like this, McKay.

10:00.855 --> 10:03.066
- I'm always like this.
- Exactly.

10:05.568 --> 10:07.904
I got a green light from Smeadon.

10:08.071 --> 10:11.282
I'm not sure how pleased he'll be
if we get stuck there.

10:13.159 --> 10:17.372
- It's not gonna happen, right?
- We can always gate off to another planet.

10:17.539 --> 10:21.334
- Comforting. Thank you.
- You sure we can't go to the mainland?

10:21.501 --> 10:25.880
Everywhere is in the storm's path.
My people are evacuating even now.

10:26.047 --> 10:31.219
The mainland's the size of North America.
Will the entire continent get hit?

10:31.386 --> 10:34.055
I'd rather not owe Smeadon any favours.

10:34.222 --> 10:37.726
If we lose Atlantis,
we're left without access to the Stargate.

10:37.892 --> 10:44.566
- McKay will come up with something.
- I will try, but I am not Superman.

10:46.526 --> 10:48.653
Was anyone seriously thinking that?

10:51.781 --> 10:53.867
- No, sir.
- Never.

10:54.034 --> 10:58.621
Fine. The storm will affect over 70%
of the mainland, and Atlantis isn't safe.

10:58.788 --> 11:01.875
If you want everyone to live,
you gate them offworld.

11:25.357 --> 11:28.401
Relay Station Two,
prepare to receive transmission.

11:30.362 --> 11:34.032
<i>(man) RS Two
awaiting transmission. Over.</i>

11:34.199 --> 11:38.119
I need you to relay a message
to Cowen of the Genii.

11:40.789 --> 11:43.291
Tell him we have something to trade.

11:48.588 --> 11:52.300
- This could be going faster.
- Our people are hunters.

11:52.467 --> 11:56.888
Many are returning from great distances.
Others do not want to leave.

11:57.055 --> 11:59.974
They know how serious this is?

12:00.141 --> 12:04.354
Even I would have a hard time
believing in the strength of this storm

12:04.521 --> 12:06.398
if I did not see it from space.

12:06.564 --> 12:09.275
Do what you can to speed things up.

12:12.696 --> 12:15.198
In the Czech Republic
we don't get hurricanes.

12:15.365 --> 12:18.743
We don't get many in Canada.
We once had one called Hazel.

12:18.910 --> 12:21.204
- Hazel?
- 40 years ago.

12:21.371 --> 12:23.915
- That's interesting.
- Not really.

12:24.082 --> 12:28.336
- No, not really.
- I was once almost struck by lightning.

12:28.503 --> 12:30.588
Lightning?

12:37.345 --> 12:40.473
What is the one thing
keeping us from having a shield?

12:41.808 --> 12:44.728
- That...
- Power. What does a storm have lots of?

12:44.894 --> 12:47.439
- Power.
- In the form of...

12:47.605 --> 12:50.942
- You wanna build a windmill?
- Electricity.

12:51.109 --> 12:55.655
Atlantis is designed to withstand lightning
strikes. There are rods everywhere.

12:55.822 --> 12:58.199
They are channelled
into grounding stations.

12:58.366 --> 13:02.037
Those grounding stations
discharge electricity back into the ocean,

13:02.203 --> 13:04.956
keeping Atlantis safe from electric shocks.

13:05.123 --> 13:10.253
Many of the hallways allow a low-voltage
transfer of power throughout the city.

13:10.420 --> 13:12.505
- Which means...
- I'm getting there.

13:12.672 --> 13:15.300
Let's say the grounding stations
weren't around.

13:15.467 --> 13:18.428
If lightning struck,
the halls would be super-charged.

13:18.595 --> 13:22.140
- You want...
- If we disabled the grounding stations...

13:22.307 --> 13:24.809
- Which we can.
...every time lightning struck,

13:24.976 --> 13:28.521
Atlantis would experience
a massive power surge. That energy...

13:28.688 --> 13:31.107
- If channelled correctly...
- Of course.

13:31.274 --> 13:34.527
...could be used to charge up
the shield generator.

13:34.694 --> 13:38.698
The more severe the storm, the more
energy, and the shield runs longer.

13:38.865 --> 13:41.743
- It's an ingenious plan.
- I have to agree.

13:41.910 --> 13:44.537
But we have no way
of storing all that energy.

13:44.704 --> 13:46.915
Once the lightning stops striking...

13:47.082 --> 13:50.251
- No way of charging the generator.
- Back to square one.

13:50.418 --> 13:52.879
So, the city would survive?

13:53.046 --> 13:54.673
- A 90% chance...
- 70.

13:54.839 --> 13:57.217
- 80% chance.
- So, we should still evacuate.

13:57.384 --> 13:59.886
- Not just for Zelemka's pessimism.
- Zelenka.

14:00.053 --> 14:03.515
If it works, the city will be
highly charged with electricity.

14:03.682 --> 14:07.769
The only safe place once the lightning
strikes is in the control room.

14:07.936 --> 14:10.730
We must evacuate everyone offworld
for the storm

14:10.897 --> 14:13.149
and execute the plan with a small team.

14:13.316 --> 14:16.069
OK. Good. Get on it.

14:16.236 --> 14:19.406
- To the grounding stations.
- Power distribution centres.

14:19.572 --> 14:24.244
- Good point. I get ahead of myself.
- Yeah, OK...

14:44.055 --> 14:46.141
<i>(yells)</i>

15:54.250 --> 15:59.297
Commander Kolya. Chief Cowen
needs to see you immediately.

15:59.464 --> 16:04.135
- I'm not to be disturbed while training.
- He said immediately, sir.

16:23.697 --> 16:26.032
- Still haven't turned up?
- I'm afraid not.

16:26.199 --> 16:29.661
They're hunting.
No one has been able to get in touch.

16:29.828 --> 16:32.831
- How many?
- Three. Two boys and a young woman.

16:32.998 --> 16:35.208
Let's take our jumper and find them.

16:35.375 --> 16:40.005
They are hunting in dense vegetation.
We would be unable to land.

16:41.256 --> 16:46.553
- Jumper Three is ready to go...
- Go. I will give the hunters more time.

16:47.470 --> 16:49.222
I'll stay with you.

16:51.099 --> 16:54.686
OK, I get the point. We'll wait.

16:56.604 --> 16:58.690
- They're not ready.
- Yes, they are.

16:58.857 --> 17:02.360
You commissioned me to train men
who on the most treacherous day

17:02.527 --> 17:06.448
guarded this facility
or performed a reconnaissance mission.

17:07.741 --> 17:10.035
They are not yet a strike force.

17:10.201 --> 17:12.912
This is the rarest of opportunities.

17:13.079 --> 17:16.333
In the next hour
there will be under ten people on Atlantis,

17:16.499 --> 17:18.877
most of them only scientists.

17:19.044 --> 17:23.089
Surely you can accomplish our goals
and get out before the storm hits.

17:23.256 --> 17:28.345
If all goes well. But we don't train
assuming all will go well.

17:28.511 --> 17:31.639
We cannot afford
to pass up this opportunity.

17:31.806 --> 17:36.311
- You wanted my opinion. I gave it to you.
- And I value that opinion.

17:38.271 --> 17:44.486
The Atlanteans possess materials that are
vital to defeat the Wraith. We need them.

17:46.029 --> 17:48.073
I need them.

17:51.368 --> 17:53.286
Ready your strike force.

18:15.725 --> 18:17.727
<i>(McKay) That's everybody.</i>

18:17.894 --> 18:20.814
Just over four and a half hours
till the storm hits.

18:20.980 --> 18:23.066
Let's get down to the labs.

18:25.485 --> 18:29.572
Evacuate the people on inbound
Jumper Two as soon as they come in.

18:39.374 --> 18:42.669
I'm finally at the point
where I don't mind the taste of it.

18:42.836 --> 18:48.800
I was raised on this brew.
Burned away whatever taste sense I had.

18:50.719 --> 18:55.348
So, you think you can teach our farmers
a thing or two?

18:55.515 --> 18:59.227
Yes, that's what I was saying, yes.

18:59.394 --> 19:05.859
Most people think that farming is planting
good seed in well-tilled soil, which it is.

19:06.026 --> 19:09.446
It is, but there's also more,

19:09.612 --> 19:13.074
and that knowledge is here.

19:13.241 --> 19:18.455
You want to trade these marvellous skills
in exchange for a piece of my land?

19:18.621 --> 19:23.001
- I do.
- I think I'll need something more.

19:23.168 --> 19:26.463
<i>(gasping and stammering)</i>

19:31.760 --> 19:34.054
Who are you?

19:34.220 --> 19:37.223
Tell me the sequence of numbers
to enter on this device.

19:37.390 --> 19:40.143
I can't tell you that.

19:40.310 --> 19:43.480
<i>- (groans)
- It's not worth dying for.</i>

19:43.646 --> 19:47.025
But you don't understand.

19:47.192 --> 19:51.821
It's my hand that you need
to put in the code. That's how it works.

19:51.988 --> 19:54.991
And the shield of the Atlantis Stargate
will be lowered?

19:55.158 --> 19:59.371
Yes. What is this? Who are they?

19:59.537 --> 20:02.123
- Bring him to the gate.
- They're friends.

20:02.290 --> 20:06.127
- Make sure he will enter the code.
- He will.

20:06.294 --> 20:09.923
Do as they say
and we'll see about that piece of land.

20:18.682 --> 20:22.560
You have done a great service
for the Genii and will be rewarded.

20:36.157 --> 20:39.411
There are hundreds of lightning rods
placed around the city.

20:39.577 --> 20:41.246
- Wait.
- What?

20:41.413 --> 20:44.332
- Why?
- Why what?

20:44.499 --> 20:48.753
Why are there hundreds of rods? Wouldn't
the shield protect against lightning?

20:48.920 --> 20:53.008
Yes, but running the shield all the time
is only good for draining power.

20:53.174 --> 20:56.094
- Right.
- You're aware there's a time element?

20:56.261 --> 21:02.267
- Yes, it's been brought to my attention.
- There are lightning rods around the city.

21:02.434 --> 21:06.813
All the energy they capture is routed
into four main grounding stations.

21:06.980 --> 21:09.733
These ground that energy
into the ocean below us.

21:09.899 --> 21:13.570
- Instead of sending electricity to ground...
- We power the shield.

21:13.737 --> 21:17.490
- How?
- By directing it into the shield generators.

21:17.657 --> 21:21.119
- The city can handle that?
- Yes... theoretically.

21:21.286 --> 21:25.749
Like dinosaurs turning into birds,
or Theory of Relativity theoretically?

21:26.708 --> 21:29.044
What? Somewhere between.

21:29.210 --> 21:34.758
Elizabeth, you take Grounding Station
Two. I'll take Grounding Station One.

21:34.924 --> 21:37.093
Major, take Stations Three and Four.

21:37.260 --> 21:40.930
- Where are Stations Three and Four?
- Here and here.

21:41.097 --> 21:43.224
- And we are...
- Here. Yes.

21:43.391 --> 21:47.145
I need to start on the subroutines
and Elizabeth has knee trouble...

21:47.312 --> 21:50.690
Wait. Are these things
even close to a transporter?

21:50.857 --> 21:53.610
- Uh, yes, Elizabeth's is.
- And mine?

21:53.777 --> 21:58.365
- It's a brisk walk away.
- By "brisk" you mean "far"?

21:58.531 --> 22:01.326
- By "walk" I mean "run".
- OK.

22:01.493 --> 22:03.912
Radio once you get to your first station.

22:04.079 --> 22:07.290
All right. Let's do it.

22:12.003 --> 22:15.799
<i>(Teyla) Hurry! Move! Come this way! Hurry!</i>

22:19.219 --> 22:21.096
- You OK?
- Here it comes.

22:21.262 --> 22:25.183
OK, sit here. Strap in as best you can.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

22:26.351 --> 22:29.562
- Let's get outta here.
- I'm not certain it's a good idea.

22:29.729 --> 22:33.858
- What?
- Look at it out there.

22:34.025 --> 22:36.236
- We are ready.
- Let's wait it out.

22:36.403 --> 22:40.323
We're safe if we're in here.
We've got rations and plenty of water.

22:40.490 --> 22:43.243
Yeah, especially outside.

22:47.288 --> 22:52.043
I hope you're right. We won't be able
to change our minds if you're wrong.

22:55.588 --> 22:58.091
It'll be cosy.

23:27.203 --> 23:29.289
I'm here!

23:29.456 --> 23:33.209
<i>(McKay) I told you to contact me
when you got to the first one.</i>

23:33.376 --> 23:35.628
I am at the first one, Rodney.

23:35.795 --> 23:38.923
Oh. Sorry. Already done mine.

23:39.090 --> 23:42.344
<i>- Great. Good for you.
- (Weir) Me too.</i>

23:43.303 --> 23:45.180
Good for everyone.

23:45.347 --> 23:49.642
- Where are you now?
- I'm at the damn grounding station.

23:49.809 --> 23:53.438
<i>- No, not you.
- (Weir) I'm in the transporter.</i>

23:54.898 --> 23:56.983
- There you are.
- There I am.

23:57.150 --> 23:59.736
<i>(Sheppard) Glad you're having fun.
What do I do?</i>

23:59.903 --> 24:02.489
There should be a keypad on the console.

24:11.206 --> 24:15.669
- Got it.
- Put in the Ancient equivalent of 031547.

24:23.802 --> 24:26.137
That do it?

24:30.183 --> 24:32.310
- Yeah.
- Good.

24:32.477 --> 24:35.480
One to go. They seem to have
the same separation code.

24:35.647 --> 24:38.817
Repeat with the next one.
Meet us in the control room.

24:38.983 --> 24:41.486
Roger that.

24:43.655 --> 24:47.075
- Bacon.
- You wish you'd brought bacon with you?

24:47.242 --> 24:50.036
It's the food
that makes other food worth eating.

24:50.203 --> 24:52.706
You wish you'd brought bacon
to another galaxy?

24:52.872 --> 24:54.749
<i>- You asked me...
- (Stargate hums)</i>

24:54.916 --> 24:59.087
- Offworld activation.
- No one should be back until tomorrow.

24:59.254 --> 25:03.049
<i>(woman) Attack on Manara.
Wounded incoming. Lower the shield.</i>

25:03.216 --> 25:07.095
<i>- They're broadcasting an Athosian IDC.
- Please, before it's too late.</i>

25:07.262 --> 25:10.265
- We are lowering the shield.
- Get the OK from Dr Weir.

25:10.432 --> 25:13.226
They're under attack. Lower the shield.

25:15.437 --> 25:17.856
Dr Weir, there's been an attack on Manara.

25:18.023 --> 25:22.110
<i>- Athosian party incoming with wounded.
- We're on our way.</i>

25:32.162 --> 25:35.123
- What happened?
- They were everywhere.

25:40.545 --> 25:42.756
Check the weapons.

25:51.931 --> 25:54.100
Secure the room.

25:59.230 --> 26:01.566
These men could have been overpowered.

26:01.733 --> 26:04.694
We need the Atlanteans to be cooperative.

26:06.446 --> 26:08.531
Secure the room.

26:10.158 --> 26:12.452
Cover the entrances.

26:28.593 --> 26:30.970
<i>(Weir) Apparently
there's wounded incoming.</i>

26:31.137 --> 26:34.557
It doesn't make any sense.
They said it was Wraith-related?

26:34.724 --> 26:38.978
We'll ask them ourselves in a second.
Hold on.

26:39.145 --> 26:41.272
What the hell is going on?

26:53.827 --> 26:55.495
Dr Elizabeth Weir.

26:56.955 --> 27:00.709
- Yes.
- And you must be Dr McKay.

27:04.421 --> 27:07.590
That is him.

27:07.757 --> 27:09.884
<i>(Kolya) Where is Major Sheppard?</i>

27:10.927 --> 27:13.471
<i>I'd like to know
Major Sheppard's whereabouts.</i>

27:13.638 --> 27:16.725
You seem to know a lot about us.

27:16.891 --> 27:19.436
- Who are you?
- The Genii.

27:19.602 --> 27:22.105
There's only one thing you need to know.

27:23.356 --> 27:27.944
As of right now,
we are in control of Atlantis.

28:00.643 --> 28:06.107
Jumper Two, this is Sheppard. Come in.
Jumper Two, do you copy?

28:09.444 --> 28:12.822
This is Ford.
We're waiting out the storm in the jumper.

28:12.989 --> 28:16.451
<i>- You're still on the mainland?
- Yes, sir.</i>

28:16.618 --> 28:20.747
We got a situation.
A small Genii strike force has gated in.

28:22.040 --> 28:25.251
The Genii? The folks who wanted us
to build them an A-bomb?

28:25.418 --> 28:29.673
They've got Weir and McKay hostage
and have control of the gate room.

28:29.839 --> 28:33.635
- You're breaking up. Did you say hostage?
- Affirmative.

28:33.802 --> 28:35.804
<i>(sighs)</i>

28:40.141 --> 28:41.810
We're on our way.

28:41.976 --> 28:44.813
- What do you think you're doing?
- You heard him.

28:44.979 --> 28:48.108
Look outside, hotshot.
We're not flying through this.

28:48.274 --> 28:51.986
McKay and Weir were taken hostage.
I can't sit here and do nothing.

28:52.153 --> 28:57.701
Neither of us are real pilots. It was a bad
idea an hour ago. It's an idiotic one now.

28:57.867 --> 29:02.914
- We must take our chances.
- Dr Beckett is right. We're no use dead.

29:03.081 --> 29:06.793
Major, this is Teyla.
The hurricane is in full force outside.

29:06.960 --> 29:10.630
<i>We could attempt to fly through it,
but it's doubtful we'd make it.</i>

29:10.797 --> 29:13.508
And we have three young passengers.

29:14.551 --> 29:17.512
- That's bad news.
- I'm sorry.

29:17.679 --> 29:20.765
So am I. Just stay put till it passes over.

29:20.932 --> 29:23.018
<i>- Sir...
- It's OK, Lieutenant.</i>

29:23.184 --> 29:27.147
Get your ass back here as soon
as you can. I could use some backup.

29:28.440 --> 29:31.192
Good luck, sir.

30:04.351 --> 30:07.020
Who are you?

30:07.187 --> 30:10.440
Commander Acastus Kolya of the Genii.

30:15.403 --> 30:19.491
This Atlantis is extraordinary.
More than I ever imagined.

30:21.284 --> 30:23.953
What have you done
with the rest of my people?

30:24.120 --> 30:26.831
I'm quite sure
they have no idea we're even here.

30:26.998 --> 30:30.669
- Then they're safe?
- Yes.

30:30.835 --> 30:33.171
How were you able to bypass the shield?

30:33.338 --> 30:38.760
With a time-tested combination
of strong drink and weak minds.

30:38.927 --> 30:42.806
There was a time when our two peoples
considered becoming allies.

30:44.683 --> 30:46.893
Why are you doing this?

30:48.353 --> 30:51.064
You're in possession of supplies
we vitally need.

30:52.273 --> 30:56.111
Hand them over without difficulty
and we leave peacefully.

30:57.153 --> 31:01.241
- Or?
- We're both intelligent people, Dr Weir.

31:02.367 --> 31:07.497
I'm sure there's no need for me
to demonstrate the strength of my resolve.

31:07.664 --> 31:10.500
Which supplies did you have in mind?

31:10.667 --> 31:14.754
All of your stores of the C4 explosive.
All of your medical supplies.

31:14.921 --> 31:19.050
The Wraith data device
you stole from my people.

31:19.217 --> 31:21.302
And one of your ships.

31:21.469 --> 31:24.264
- Is that all?
- No.

31:27.058 --> 31:29.144
Where is Major Sheppard?

31:29.310 --> 31:34.941
He's on the mainland.
What you're asking for is not easy.

31:35.108 --> 31:38.319
We've diverted a lot of power
to prepare for the storm.

31:38.486 --> 31:41.740
The armoury's safety doors have shut,
so we can't...

31:42.782 --> 31:46.828
Just so we're clear, I know you lie.

31:51.541 --> 31:53.626
Just give him what he needs.

31:53.793 --> 31:58.465
<i>He needs the C4, the medical supplies
and the Wraith data device. Give it to him.</i>

31:58.631 --> 32:01.885
<i>None of that's worth dying for.</i>

32:06.556 --> 32:08.808
Step away from the console.

32:08.975 --> 32:11.061
I was just leaning.

32:11.227 --> 32:13.438
Your request is unreasonable.

32:13.605 --> 32:18.401
You can't possibly need all our C4
or all our medical supplies.

32:18.568 --> 32:21.571
You're in no position
to tell me what is reasonable.

32:21.738 --> 32:25.408
How do we know you won't kill us
once we give you what we need?

32:25.575 --> 32:27.869
You don't.

32:28.703 --> 32:33.416
Please show my men where they can find
what they're looking for.

32:48.932 --> 32:53.770
- What are you doing here?
- I understand I'm being held hostage.

32:53.937 --> 32:58.400
I mean here in Atlantis.
Why did some of you stay behind?

32:58.566 --> 33:03.279
Oh. Tie up some loose ends.

33:04.322 --> 33:08.368
- Like what?
- Make sure everyone got out OK.

33:10.120 --> 33:14.833
- Isn't that for someone less important?
- You'd think so, wouldn't you?

33:17.502 --> 33:21.881
- You have a plan, don't you?
- I got lots of plans about lots of things.

33:22.048 --> 33:24.676
I'm interested in your plan to save the city.

33:24.843 --> 33:28.054
I never said anything
about saving anything.

33:28.221 --> 33:30.682
Not yet.

34:04.424 --> 34:06.885
Where's Teyla Emmagan?

34:08.762 --> 34:11.598
- You know Teyla?
- Is she here? In the city?

34:13.766 --> 34:15.851
No, she isn't.

34:18.688 --> 34:24.485
You must be Sora. I read the Genii
mission report. I'm sorry about your father.

34:24.652 --> 34:27.614
- He'll be avenged.
- Teyla didn't kill him.

34:27.781 --> 34:31.242
- No. She left him to die.
- She had no choice...

34:31.409 --> 34:33.828
Are you finished?

34:39.333 --> 34:45.674
All of the information we downloaded
from the Wraith ship is still on this device.

35:25.046 --> 35:29.843
- What did they do to you?
- I tried to keep my mouth shut. I couldn't...

35:30.010 --> 35:33.555
What's the meaning of this?

35:33.722 --> 35:37.600
- I honestly have no idea.
- It's a radio.

35:37.767 --> 35:40.979
The arrow points to the talk button.

35:42.188 --> 35:46.818
- This is Commander Kolya.
- Kolya. That's a hard name to pronounce.

35:46.985 --> 35:51.990
Is that a first name?
My name's Major John Sheppard.

35:52.157 --> 35:57.412
I have hidden the C4 where you will never,
I repeat, never, find it.

35:57.579 --> 36:03.251
When I hear that the prisoners have been
safely released and gated off Atlantis,

36:03.418 --> 36:05.837
<i>I will help you find it.</i>

36:06.004 --> 36:10.008
- He's good.
- Yes, he is. I'd do what he says.

36:10.175 --> 36:13.511
- Your offer is very generous, Major.
- Yes, it is.

36:13.678 --> 36:19.267
<i>However, Dr McKay recently told me
there's a plan in action to save the city.</i>

36:19.434 --> 36:21.770
- He did?
- He did.

36:21.936 --> 36:25.774
I understand one final grounding station
needs to be deactivated.

36:25.940 --> 36:30.737
Uncouple the grounding rods at Station
Three, assist in reactivating the shield

36:30.904 --> 36:33.239
and you and your friends
can leave unharmed.

36:33.406 --> 36:37.035
Wait a minute. I thought all you wanted
was C4 and a jumper.

36:37.202 --> 36:40.080
Why raid a city
when you can seize it, Major?

36:40.246 --> 36:42.332
Atlantis will be ours or the ocean's.

36:45.502 --> 36:48.380
You choose.

36:57.806 --> 37:00.350
We should have heard something
from the major.

37:00.517 --> 37:04.270
- He may not have had a chance.
- I hate not knowing what's going on.

37:04.437 --> 37:09.359
- Why would the Genii attack us now?
- We didn't exactly leave on the best terms.

37:09.526 --> 37:13.154
We stole some of their gear
and didn't give them C4 as promised,

37:13.321 --> 37:15.657
and they think Teyla killed one of them.

37:15.824 --> 37:21.204
They believe so falsely. The fact that they
chose our weakest hour is no coincidence.

37:21.371 --> 37:24.332
Someone must have told them
we'd be diminished.

37:24.499 --> 37:28.461
- There must be a way back.
- Those winds are blowing at 110 knots.

37:28.628 --> 37:30.714
We're not going anywhere, son.

37:50.900 --> 37:53.153
Thank you for seeing me.

37:54.738 --> 37:59.326
This city was designed to be inhabited
by the Ancients and their descendants.

37:59.492 --> 38:04.914
Although there is limited functionality for
those who do not have the Ancient gene,

38:05.081 --> 38:08.877
only those who have it
can revive the city to its true potential.

38:11.212 --> 38:15.592
- And you have this gene?
- No, but many of my team do.

38:17.010 --> 38:19.387
The Wraith are slowly waking.

38:19.554 --> 38:25.268
Soon this galaxy will be in a war the likes
of which our generations have never seen.

38:25.435 --> 38:27.896
A war that you expedited.

38:28.063 --> 38:31.441
Disagreements like ours
will no longer matter.

38:31.608 --> 38:34.110
The only thing of any consequence

38:34.277 --> 38:38.114
will be how prepared we are
and what defence we are able to mount.

38:39.115 --> 38:42.577
This city holds many secrets
which could help us win that war.

38:44.162 --> 38:46.706
But only if my team
are here to discover them.

38:46.873 --> 38:49.626
So, fine, take whatever you need
for your people,

38:50.585 --> 38:54.923
but if you don't leave us this city,
you're hurting yourselves in the long run.

38:56.716 --> 38:59.928
You believe your people,
who are not even of this galaxy,

39:00.095 --> 39:02.389
are closer to the Ancients than we are?

39:03.765 --> 39:06.893
Your arrogance is astounding.

39:07.060 --> 39:12.524
We will take this city,
we will mount a defence and we will win,

39:12.691 --> 39:15.193
with or without your help, Dr Weir.

39:15.360 --> 39:18.488
Sir, he's at the grounding station.

39:32.752 --> 39:35.922
<i>- The commander's here.
- He's just standing there, sir.</i>

39:36.089 --> 39:39.926
<i>- Do not approach until he's finished.
- Yes, sir.</i>

39:40.093 --> 39:42.178
Use lethal force only if necessary.

39:42.345 --> 39:47.851
- You told him he would be unharmed.
- Let's hope he doesn't put up a fight.

40:06.870 --> 40:10.999
<i>He's stopped. He's not
at the control panel. He's looking around.</i>

40:11.166 --> 40:14.461
- Hold your fire.
- Those control panels are fragile...

41:03.885 --> 41:06.346
Let me tell you what you did wrong, Kolya.

41:07.222 --> 41:10.475
<i>A: You lost two of your men.</i>

41:11.810 --> 41:17.440
B: You damaged the switch before
I could separate the grounding rods,

41:17.607 --> 41:22.237
which I'm sure you're gonna get
an earful from McKay for.

41:22.404 --> 41:28.952
And C: You lost all of
what little credibility you had with me.

41:30.370 --> 41:34.791
You know how big a setback that is?
I may not be able to activate the shield...

41:37.127 --> 41:41.214
- You killed two of my men.
- I guess we're even.

41:41.381 --> 41:44.009
I don't like even.

41:45.218 --> 41:47.512
I'm not finished yet.

41:48.304 --> 41:50.390
Neither am I.

41:52.142 --> 41:54.436
Say goodbye to Dr Weir.

41:54.602 --> 41:56.855
<i>The city has a self-destruct button.</i>

41:57.022 --> 41:59.107
<i>If you hurt her, I'll activate it.</i>

41:59.274 --> 42:01.735
Nobody'll get Atlantis.

42:01.901 --> 42:06.698
Even if it exists, Major, you need
at least two senior personnel to activate it.

42:07.699 --> 42:10.285
I'm taking one of them out of the equation.

42:11.578 --> 42:14.080
<i>Kolya?</i>

42:19.878 --> 42:22.213
Kolya?

42:23.256 --> 42:25.425
I'll give you a ship.

42:26.468 --> 42:29.304
I'll fly it out of here for you myself.

42:36.144 --> 42:38.229
Kolya?
