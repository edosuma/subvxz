00:28.577 --> 00:30.187
- No, Daddy!

00:30.769 --> 00:33.859
I just wanted to
play with the dolls.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.036
No, Daddy, no!

01:16.946 --> 01:17.729
- Mommy!

01:19.601 --> 01:20.993
- Did you have a nightmare?

01:21.037 --> 01:22.430
- Saw a strange man.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.870
Can you sleep with me?

01:27.913 --> 01:30.568
- What did we say about
sleeping with mom and dad, hm?

01:30.612 --> 01:32.831
- Only in thunderstorms.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.138
- That's right, because
you're a big boy now.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.400
Okay?

01:38.141 --> 01:40.883
- Hey, Mommy, will you check
under the bed for monsters?

01:42.493 --> 01:43.712
- Yes.

01:53.591 --> 01:56.246
- I think there's
somebody in my bed.

03:17.327 --> 03:18.633
- Oh, hey.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.243
You aren't the owner
by chance, are you?

03:20.287 --> 03:21.201
- Oh, no, no, no.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.985
My name's Johannes or Johann.

03:23.028 --> 03:24.508
Friends call me Joe.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.336
I fix things around here,
the whole neighborhood.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.685
- Hello, Johann.

03:27.729 --> 03:28.991
- Hi, Joe.

03:29.034 --> 03:31.776
- Is the real estate
agent still inside?

03:31.820 --> 03:33.996
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, go right
inside, take a look around.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.867
This is a very special place.

03:35.911 --> 03:38.130
But don't forget, you buy
the house, you buy me too.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.741
Because I'll be around.

03:39.784 --> 03:40.742
I'm always here.

03:41.786 --> 03:42.613
- Okay.

03:42.657 --> 03:43.440
See you around.

03:51.492 --> 03:52.928
Alright.

03:52.971 --> 03:55.104
- I love this old, old look.

03:55.147 --> 03:56.148
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.064
- Hi.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.892
You must be Carrie, right?

04:00.936 --> 04:03.808
I hope it's okay, Johann
outside told us to come on in.

04:03.852 --> 04:06.158
- Oh, Johann, he's a
fixture around here.

04:06.202 --> 04:08.857
You guys must be the Burrows.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.947
And you're late, I was
just about to lock up.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.602
- Oh, yeah, sorry about
that, the plane was delayed.

04:14.645 --> 04:15.907
- There's still some time.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.387
I can show you around
the house if you'd like.

04:17.430 --> 04:18.779
- Yes, we would love that.

04:18.822 --> 04:20.216
What do you think?

04:20.260 --> 04:20.956
Do you want to see the
rest of the house, Johnny?

04:20.999 --> 04:21.696
- Uh huh.

04:21.738 --> 04:22.610
- Okay, let's do it.

04:22.653 --> 04:23.872
- Alright, come on up.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.482
- Really,
really sorry we're late.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.615
- That's okay,
happens all the time.

04:27.658 --> 04:28.920
- No,
I feel terrible.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.487
It was pretty hectic.

04:30.531 --> 04:32.446
- And if you'll
follow me this way.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.274
- Aha.

04:34.317 --> 04:35.884
- This is our main parlor room.

04:35.927 --> 04:40.323
This room, actually this house
was built in the late 1700s.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.977
- Wow, pretty old.

04:42.020 --> 04:45.981
- Yeah, it contains all of
its original wood flooring.

04:46.024 --> 04:49.332
You can see there's
vaulted ceilings and...

04:49.376 --> 04:50.115
- Beautiful.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.160
- Yeah, and--

04:51.203 --> 04:52.683
- Fireplace in here.

04:52.727 --> 04:53.902
- Yeah, and this organ,
is it a functioning organ?

04:53.945 --> 04:55.338
- It's actually, it
comes with the house.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.471
It's a 200 year old organ.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.342
It's actually been
featured in shows

04:59.386 --> 05:02.302
of Phantom of the Opera, you
might actually remember that.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.347
- We could learn to
play the piano together.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.306
- That would be fun.

05:06.349 --> 05:09.744
- Do any of you
guys play, you play at all?

05:09.787 --> 05:11.006
- No.
- No.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.268
We've been talking
about taking lessons.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.878
- For a long, long time.

05:13.922 --> 05:17.447
- Oh, well, now's
your opportunity.

05:17.491 --> 05:18.753
What about your son?

05:18.796 --> 05:20.320
Does your son have
any sports or--

05:20.363 --> 05:21.364
- It would be the perfect
age for him to learn as well.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.191
- Absolutely.

05:22.234 --> 05:23.148
- Absolutely.

05:23.192 --> 05:26.195
Now exactly how old is he again?

05:26.238 --> 05:27.109
- Eight years old.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.328
- Oh, he's eight years old.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.807
Yeah, that's a really,
really good time

05:29.851 --> 05:31.853
to start getting your
kids into the arts.

05:31.896 --> 05:32.984
- Yeah, it'd be
the perfect timing,

05:33.028 --> 05:33.855
he's like a little sponge.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.291
- Yeah.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.369
- Look at this room.

06:10.282 --> 06:11.936
- Aha, here you are.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.331
Where have you been?

06:21.293 --> 06:22.773
- This would be
perfect for my work.

06:22.817 --> 06:26.298
- Actually, this room was
used as a home office before.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.388
What did you say
you do, Mr. Burrows?

06:28.431 --> 06:30.215
- Oh, I'm a writer.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.784
But my beautiful wife
here is a neurophysicist,

06:33.828 --> 06:35.569
she's practically
a brain surgeon.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.309
- No, no, he always
gives me too much credit.

06:37.353 --> 06:40.617
I don't have a MD, just a PhD.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.227
No brain surgeries for me.

06:43.228 --> 06:45.100
- Oh, wow!

06:46.231 --> 06:47.319
Wow, honey?

06:47.363 --> 06:48.146
- Yeah?

06:49.365 --> 06:50.235
Wow.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.020
- Jen, this is a sign.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.325
- This, it's clearly a sign.

06:53.369 --> 06:54.675
- Right, alright?

06:54.718 --> 06:56.677
Wow, this is so cool.
- It's a sign.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.069
- Johnny, buddy, look at this.

06:58.113 --> 07:01.377
This is an old, old,
old typewriter, huh?

07:02.334 --> 07:04.293
- So Stanley just got a
new writing assignment

07:04.336 --> 07:05.468
and that's sort of the reason

07:05.512 --> 07:07.339
we left the New
York City rat race

07:07.383 --> 07:10.604
and opted for something a
little bit more traditional.

07:10.647 --> 07:13.215
- Oh, well, this place is
perfect for your family.

07:13.258 --> 07:14.956
Your son is gonna love it.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.001
- I think we
are all gonna love it.

07:17.045 --> 07:18.655
What's in here?

07:18.699 --> 07:20.483
- That
cabinet was left here

07:20.527 --> 07:22.224
by the original tenants.

07:22.267 --> 07:26.358
It's a very old antique
with quite a history.

07:26.402 --> 07:27.272
- It's creepy.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.147
And creepy dolls, huh?

07:35.324 --> 07:36.064
Cool.

07:37.979 --> 07:38.762
Wicked.

07:39.763 --> 07:40.851
- Oh boy.

07:40.895 --> 07:43.071
- Also left by the last tenant.

07:44.376 --> 07:45.900
- Well, you know what, you can
go ahead and leave it here.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.424
I could always use a little
inspiration for my work.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.165
- Stanley
writes horror.

07:50.208 --> 07:50.992
- Oh.

07:53.255 --> 07:54.735
- Hi there, buddy.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.302
- Well, guys, I guess this
is where I just say it.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.914
The law requires
that I inform you

07:59.957 --> 08:02.786
if the house is
psychologically impacted.

08:04.005 --> 08:06.355
- I'm sorry, do
you mean haunted?

08:06.398 --> 08:09.401
- Well, the legal term
is emotionally defect.

08:10.446 --> 08:11.186
- Uh huh.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.492
- So what happened here?

08:12.535 --> 08:15.712
- A very long time ago,
a young girl died here.

08:15.756 --> 08:18.498
The official story is that
her father went insane

08:18.541 --> 08:22.371
and just left her to starve
to death inside of a toy box.

08:22.414 --> 08:25.505
Her name was Alison Sullivan.

08:25.548 --> 08:26.941
- Inside a toy box?

08:26.984 --> 08:30.858
- Her father was a single
parent, an alcoholic.

08:30.901 --> 08:33.687
I guess he just got
abusive and neglectful

08:33.730 --> 08:36.690
and just left her
to starve to death.

08:36.732 --> 08:39.562
The authorities found her
inside of the toy box,

08:39.606 --> 08:42.957
having eaten her
dolls to stay alive.

08:43.000 --> 08:43.957
- Oh my god.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.481
- I don't mean to frighten you.

08:49.659 --> 08:52.140
Well, it's getting late

08:52.183 --> 08:54.621
and I really do have
to lock up here.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.797
I am sorry about
the spooky story

08:56.840 --> 08:59.713
but the law requires
that I inform you.

08:59.756 --> 09:00.714
- I love it.

09:03.630 --> 09:04.544
- We love it.

09:04.587 --> 09:05.936
We love it.
- We love it.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.460
- It is hard to sell
a place like this

09:08.504 --> 09:10.114
with that kind of a story.

09:10.158 --> 09:13.596
Second thoughts are common
with such a history.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.858
- No second thoughts here

09:14.902 --> 09:16.338
and I know there's none for Jen.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.558
Most importantly,
after that story,

09:18.601 --> 09:20.385
imagine we're getting
a pretty good deal.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.172
- Right, right, absolutely.

09:28.524 --> 09:30.787
- Mrs. Burrows, where
would you like this?

09:30.831 --> 09:32.528
- That should go up
in the master bedroom.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.790
Thank you.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.139
Yes, I'm calling
about a, hi baby.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.880
- Mommy, can I go play outside?

09:36.924 --> 09:39.622
- Yes, you may, just stay
nearby, please, okay?

09:39.666 --> 09:41.406
I'm calling about a new account.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.930
I'd like to set
up a new account?

09:42.973 --> 09:44.496
New resident, mm-hm.

09:44.540 --> 09:45.323
- Johnny boy!

09:47.412 --> 09:48.936
Hey buddy, I'm gonna go
for a little jog real quick

09:48.979 --> 09:52.113
and when I get back, you
and I are going exploring.

09:52.156 --> 09:52.896
Sound good?

09:52.940 --> 09:53.941
Alright.

09:53.984 --> 09:54.637
I'll be right back.
- Bye.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.117
- Bye.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.647
- Yes, yes, I have had
a chance to look at it

10:04.691 --> 10:07.694
and no, I actually don't think
he'd be a good candidate.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.521
I would recommend elimination
of the nerve supply

10:09.565 --> 10:10.566
to the pineal gland.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.741
I think that would be curative

10:11.785 --> 10:13.787
in this specific
schizophrenic incident.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.790
- So you really
think he needs medication?

10:16.833 --> 10:17.834
- No, no, no.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.141
Stanley's not losing his mind.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.577
I know he thinks
he's seeing things

10:21.621 --> 10:23.535
but I can assure you he isn't.

10:23.579 --> 10:27.148
Stanley is not schizophrenic,
Stanley is just stressed out.

10:27.191 --> 10:28.453
Thanks for asking.

10:28.497 --> 10:29.585
- I'll talk
to him, bye bye.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.021
- Okay.

10:31.065 --> 10:31.892
- Mrs. Burrows, I know
you have a lot of stress,

10:31.935 --> 10:33.458
so iced tea with
some fresh mint.

10:33.502 --> 10:36.200
- That is so nice,
thank you, thank you.

10:36.244 --> 10:37.245
Hi there.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.463
I'm back.

10:38.507 --> 10:39.813
Yes.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.337
No, no, we're actually
already in the house.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.338
Yeah.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.406
- See that?

11:08.450 --> 11:09.451
Got our own little pond.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.452
Pretty cool, huh?

11:10.495 --> 11:11.366
- Yeah.

11:11.409 --> 11:12.062
- Let's go sit down.

11:12.106 --> 11:12.846
- Dad?

11:12.889 --> 11:13.673
- Yeah.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.675
- What is that house?

11:15.718 --> 11:18.590
- That house is what
they call a spring house.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.984
So the water would come
run down off the hill.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.421
- That hill?

11:23.465 --> 11:24.945
- Yep, just right
down that little hill.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.424
You can see where like the
stream would come down,

11:26.468 --> 11:29.514
it'd run down into this
bottom part of this house,

11:29.558 --> 11:31.603
it would also fill up this pond,

11:31.647 --> 11:33.127
and when the water was in there,

11:33.170 --> 11:35.564
it would keep all of their food,

11:35.607 --> 11:37.871
vegetables and meat and
stuff, refrigerated.

11:37.914 --> 11:41.701
So it was pretty much
the first refrigerator.

12:15.691 --> 12:18.650
- So, how was
everyone's first day?

12:18.694 --> 12:19.956
- Great.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.566
- Yeah, we had a great
day, didn't we, buddy?

12:21.610 --> 12:23.655
Hell of a thing being
out here now we're in it.

12:24.787 --> 12:27.137
Fresh air, the
trees, the animals.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.706
Killing bad guys and
taking over the world, huh?

12:30.750 --> 12:35.406
- Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

12:35.450 --> 12:38.627
- Say, I hate to be a
, but I feel different.

12:40.063 --> 12:40.890
- You do.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.152
- Yeah.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.589
Must be all the freedom
and the open space.

12:44.633 --> 12:45.677
- That's good.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.505
- Yeah.

12:47.549 --> 12:52.554
- Mm.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.824
- Mm.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.044
Honey, mm.

13:05.393 --> 13:06.611
Oh my god.

13:06.655 --> 13:07.525
- That good?

13:07.569 --> 13:08.962
- Mm-hm, this is amazing.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.354
Are you gonna eat that?

13:10.398 --> 13:11.138
No?

13:11.181 --> 13:11.921
Are you sure?

13:11.965 --> 13:12.879
You sure, I can have it?

13:31.636 --> 13:32.899
Honey buns.

13:32.942 --> 13:33.856
- I'm coming.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.379
- Love of my life.

13:35.423 --> 13:36.293
Hurry up.

13:37.120 --> 13:37.904
Come to bed.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.733
- I just
needed to brush my teeth.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.039
- Okay.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.562
- And put on
my sweatpants, you know?

13:44.606 --> 13:45.955
- I know.

13:45.999 --> 13:48.044
I got something for ya.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.437
Oh my goodness.

13:51.439 --> 13:52.266
- Hi.

13:52.309 --> 13:53.049
- Hi.

13:53.093 --> 13:53.876
- Hi.

13:55.530 --> 13:56.270
Hi.

14:00.317 --> 14:00.970
Baby?

14:01.014 --> 14:01.884
- Like it?

14:01.928 --> 14:03.190
- Do I like it?

14:04.365 --> 14:06.933
Oh my god, I don't
think we can afford--

14:06.976 --> 14:08.978
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.153
Don't worry about
it, don't worry,

14:10.197 --> 14:12.068
I'm getting the
advance in a few weeks.

14:12.112 --> 14:13.026
- I love it.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.506
I love it, love it, love it.

14:16.638 --> 14:17.421
I love it.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.120
Can you put it on me?

14:20.163 --> 14:20.947
- Of course I can.

14:20.990 --> 14:21.817
- Okay.

14:23.950 --> 14:24.733
- Like that.

14:24.776 --> 14:25.690
- It looks beautiful.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.344
- Boom, Huh?

14:27.388 --> 14:28.476
- Uh huh.

14:28.519 --> 14:29.259
- There we go.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.739
- Mm-hm.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.088
And thank you for today.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.177
- What'd I do now?

14:35.352 --> 14:36.701
- You were just
amazing with Johnny,

14:36.745 --> 14:38.790
it really shows through.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.053
And he needs you.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.884
- Well, he's not the
only one with needs.

14:45.841 --> 14:50.541
- Oh, who else has needs?

14:51.716 --> 14:53.283
- Possibly this guy.

14:56.808 --> 15:01.726
♪ One, two, three,
play with me ♪

15:03.641 --> 15:08.646
♪ Four, five, six,
let's hide and seek ♪

15:10.910 --> 15:15.915
♪ Seven, eight, nine,
your soul is mine ♪

15:17.525 --> 15:21.921
♪ 10, 11, 12, I'll
break your spine ♪

15:29.798 --> 15:31.017
- Hello?

15:39.155 --> 15:41.244
- Hello, Johnny.

15:43.420 --> 15:46.293
I'm coming for you.

16:08.532 --> 16:09.751
- Oh, Johnny!

16:09.794 --> 16:10.839
Johnny.

16:20.457 --> 16:22.372
You feeling a little
better, honey?

16:22.416 --> 16:23.156
Good.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.853
How's your tummy?

16:24.896 --> 16:26.637
Yeah, does it feel
better when I rub it?

16:26.681 --> 16:27.899
Okay, good.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.379
Let's try to remember
a really fun time

16:29.423 --> 16:30.946
before we go to sleep.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.993
How about that
vacation in Hawaii?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.691
Did you like that one?

16:36.734 --> 16:38.998
And the water was all
sparkly and light blue

16:39.041 --> 16:40.869
and you stood up
on the surfboard?

16:40.912 --> 16:42.914
- I fell about four times.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.004
- Oh, I don't
remember four times.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.136
I remember maybe two, tops.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.660
And then what'd we do
when we got on the beach?

16:50.835 --> 16:52.794
- Dad threw the
Frisbee at your eye.

16:53.621 --> 16:54.883
- He did.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.189
He did, he hit me
smack dab in the eye

16:56.232 --> 16:58.930
and you were laughing
your little face off.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.976
And I was not laughing.

17:12.074 --> 17:16.296
Well, certain species of
crows top the avian IQ scales.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.776
Avian means bird, we learned
that last week, right?

17:18.819 --> 17:20.343
- Uh huh.

17:20.387 --> 17:21.605
- So they can count, they
have really good memories,

17:21.648 --> 17:23.564
and some of them even
partake in activities

17:23.607 --> 17:25.608
that closely resemble sports.

17:25.653 --> 17:26.393
- Wow.

17:26.435 --> 17:27.785
- I know, wow is right.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.360
Stan?

17:37.404 --> 17:38.796
Stan, would you come down?

17:40.059 --> 17:40.842
- Perfect.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.980
- Yes, I'll be paying with
credit card, thank you.

17:49.024 --> 17:50.460
Oh, no, no,.

17:54.247 --> 17:55.030
Just one second.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.075
Oh!

17:56.118 --> 17:56.901
Baby, I need the card.

17:57.728 --> 17:58.468
I need your card.

17:58.512 --> 17:59.252
- Of course your do.

17:59.295 --> 18:00.427
- Hand it over.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.906
Uh huh.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.386
Mm-hm.

18:04.605 --> 18:05.388
Thank you.

18:07.477 --> 18:08.435
Yes.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.001
It is eight nine zero zero--

18:10.045 --> 18:11.960
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
careful, careful, careful.

18:12.003 --> 18:14.093
These are my prized possessions.

18:15.268 --> 18:16.399
You a bourbon drinker?

18:18.097 --> 18:19.794
It's the only
thing worth a damn.

18:19.837 --> 18:20.882
- Language.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.971
- This is the good shit.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.407
- Babe, Stanley Victor.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.062
- Sorry, mother.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.324
- Okay, thank you so much.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.325
4:00 p.m. is great.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.459
Okay, I'm not sure how

18:32.502 --> 18:33.895
but I think I just got
the gas turned on today.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.679
- Honey, you are amazing.

18:36.550 --> 18:37.942
One woman wonder.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.205
- You know, it would
go a whole lot faster

18:39.248 --> 18:41.076
if you would keep
out around here.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.599
- Hey, I gotta get to work ASAP.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.688
Gotta pay those bills, you know?

18:44.732 --> 18:46.299
- Okay, well, we moved out here

18:46.342 --> 18:48.431
to spend time together as a
family, try not to forget that.

18:48.475 --> 18:49.824
- Yes, ma'am.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.393
And to write.

18:53.436 --> 18:54.785
- Uh huh.
- Uh huh.

18:54.829 --> 18:55.960
- Uh huh.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.571
Not in front of the workers.

18:57.614 --> 18:58.528
- Yeah, sorry.

18:58.572 --> 18:59.312
- Yeah.

18:59.355 --> 19:00.139
- Mr. Burrows.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.011
You like bourbon?

19:03.054 --> 19:04.099
- I do.

19:06.057 --> 19:07.450
- The workers and I
would like to present you

19:07.494 --> 19:10.497
with this special local bourbon,

19:10.540 --> 19:12.890
sort of as a housewarming gift.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.979
- Oh, that's
lovely, Johann, thank you.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.590
- Thank you, Johann.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.896
- These local herbs enhance
the flavor of the bourbon.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.855
I think you're really
going to like it.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.988
I'm gonna need a check
to pay the workers.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.166
- Alright, follow me.

19:27.209 --> 19:27.992
- Yeah.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.980
- Oh, oh, oh, this
is the green paint.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.677
Yeah, make sure that only
goes in the living room.

20:00.721 --> 20:03.376
We switched what we
want in the dining room.

20:05.029 --> 20:06.248
- Jennifer!

20:06.292 --> 20:07.597
- Benjamin.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.164
- Oh my
god, look at you!

20:09.208 --> 20:11.079
- Well, hello, what
a long journey.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.167
- Did you get younger
and more beautiful?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.213
What happened, what happened?

20:15.126 --> 20:16.171
- You
really think flattery

20:16.215 --> 20:17.303
will get you everywhere.

20:17.346 --> 20:18.565
- Boy, do you feel
good in my arms.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.175
- You brought champagne.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.742
- The truth is I came to
see you and not the husband,

20:21.785 --> 20:23.265
but I'll go see him
as long as he's here.

20:23.309 --> 20:26.007
- He's upstairs in the
study, always working.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.313
- And you're coming back?

20:27.356 --> 20:28.096
- Yeah, I'm just going
to the grocery store,

20:28.139 --> 20:28.836
I'll be back soon.

20:28.879 --> 20:29.619
- We're gonna wait.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.099
- Alright, see you soon.

20:36.147 --> 20:40.021
- Stanley!

20:40.064 --> 20:40.804
Stanley!

20:42.110 --> 20:45.244
Stanley, it's Benny,
your favorite agent.

20:46.462 --> 20:48.072
- Yeah, first door on the right.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.291
- Did you forget about me?

20:49.335 --> 20:50.814
- Oh, come on, never.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.555
- Come here, I've missed you.

20:52.599 --> 20:53.339
How long ago?

20:53.382 --> 20:54.862
It's been too long.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.212
It's beautiful, beautiful.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.127
And look at your
beautiful place.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.215
It's crazy.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.738
- Thank you so much.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.827
- This is a gorgeous,
gorgeous place.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.089
- Thank you so much.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.265
- But you're happy here,
you're feeling good?

21:06.308 --> 21:07.831
- Oh, it is fantastic
out here, Ben.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.616
I gotta say, I think it's
gonna be great for the wifey.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.270
She's getting real sick
of that New York life.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.141
- I think it's gonna be good
for you, for the writing,

21:13.184 --> 21:14.577
I think for the two of you,

21:14.621 --> 21:15.926
for the marriage,
for everything.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.972
And Johnny, gonna be
great for everybody.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.278
- Absolutely.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.236
And you know, I wish
we had come out here

21:21.280 --> 21:22.455
when it was done
up a little nicer.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.152
It's not a lot to
look at right now.

21:24.195 --> 21:25.893
- It's kind of
like a first draft.

21:25.936 --> 21:26.763
Or second draft.

21:26.807 --> 21:27.851
It's like a polish.

21:27.895 --> 21:30.114
It's like a polish, I get it.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.464
- Always the witty one, huh?

21:31.507 --> 21:33.161
Come on, let's step outside.

21:33.204 --> 21:34.858
- The humorous agent
from Hollywood.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.556
They call me the humorous
agent from Hollywood.

21:36.599 --> 21:37.426
- Brilliant.

21:40.255 --> 21:43.302
- Oh my god, I love this view.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.520
- It's beautiful, isn't it?

21:44.564 --> 21:45.478
- Crazy.

21:45.521 --> 21:46.566
Look at this thing.

21:47.567 --> 21:48.481
Wow.

21:48.524 --> 21:49.873
- Yeah, do you hear that, huh?

21:49.917 --> 21:51.919
No horns, no sirens.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.356
- I'm not used to this.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.967
Silence, you hear nothing?

21:57.011 --> 21:59.230
Here, but how you doing,
how you settling in?

21:59.274 --> 22:01.189
- Well, you know Jen.

22:01.232 --> 22:04.323
It's a hurricane
but I gotta tell ya,

22:04.366 --> 22:06.107
pretty excited about starting
this new writing assignment.

22:06.150 --> 22:09.240
Speaking of which,
how'd the meeting go?

22:09.284 --> 22:11.155
- So I got great news for you.

22:11.199 --> 22:12.679
They love you.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.245
It went great.

22:14.289 --> 22:16.204
I'm telling ya, I think we're
gonna make a great deal.

22:16.247 --> 22:17.118
- Yes!

22:17.161 --> 22:18.249
Good, good, good.

22:18.293 --> 22:19.468
So what are they putting up?

22:19.512 --> 22:21.383
- What do you mean what
are they putting up?

22:21.427 --> 22:22.341
- Advance?

22:22.384 --> 22:23.864
What are they paying me, Ben?

22:23.907 --> 22:25.126
- Stanley, you're talking
about the old days.

22:25.169 --> 22:27.128
Nobody puts up advances anymore.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.434
That's a different time period.

22:28.477 --> 22:29.870
You actually have to
write the screenplay,

22:29.913 --> 22:31.088
we have to show it to them.

22:31.132 --> 22:32.568
- What are you talking about?

22:32.612 --> 22:34.135
You got me a six figure
advance on my last screenplay.

22:34.178 --> 22:35.832
- Six years ago.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.399
- Then find a studio
that'll pay upfront.

22:37.443 --> 22:38.705
I'm not gonna write this thing

22:38.748 --> 22:40.054
with the hopes that
they're gonna buy it.

22:40.097 --> 22:42.709
- See, how do I say
this nicely to you?

22:42.752 --> 22:45.364
Your last movie was a disaster.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.235
They don't want
slasher movies anymore.

22:47.278 --> 22:48.410
Stanley.

22:48.454 --> 22:49.585
- Ben, that was the
director, not me.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.500
It wasn't supposed
to be a slasher film,

22:51.544 --> 22:53.284
it was supposed to be a
psychological thriller.

22:53.328 --> 22:55.112
You read the script,
you know that.

22:55.156 --> 22:57.506
- Yeah, yeah, I know
it, you know it,

22:57.550 --> 22:59.595
but they don't know it, the
executives don't know it.

22:59.639 --> 23:01.249
That's what we
have to show them.

23:01.292 --> 23:02.729
I'm telling you, you just
have to write a screenplay.

23:02.772 --> 23:04.818
I'll hand deliver it myself.

23:04.861 --> 23:06.341
- Ben, I moved
into this new house

23:06.385 --> 23:08.256
based on a writing
assignment you said I had.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.258
Now you're telling
me there's no money?

23:10.301 --> 23:11.346
- No, no, no, I'm not
saying there's no money.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.130
I'm saying there is money.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.002
I'm saying you have to
write the screenplay,

23:15.045 --> 23:18.266
I deliver it to them,
and I get them to buy it.

23:18.309 --> 23:20.050
- Okay, in the meantime,
how am I supposed to pay

23:20.094 --> 23:22.401
for this house and all
the crap that's going on?

23:23.402 --> 23:24.185
- Well.

23:25.708 --> 23:28.189
Stanley, I would lend you
the money myself if I could

23:28.232 --> 23:30.234
but honestly, things
are a little tough.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.236
You think you're the only
writer I'm having problems with?

23:32.280 --> 23:33.716
I've got a stable of
writers like this.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.545
They're not giving
advances anymore.

23:36.589 --> 23:39.418
But I'm telling you, I
feel it in my kishkes.

23:39.461 --> 23:42.029
Write the screenplay,
I'll make a deal,

23:42.072 --> 23:43.465
the two of us'll
have so much money,

23:43.509 --> 23:45.380
I'll buy a house
right next to you.

23:46.512 --> 23:47.338
Let's make a toast.

23:47.382 --> 23:48.905
We need a drink.

23:48.949 --> 23:52.431
A toast to you, the family,
and the future project.

23:55.303 --> 23:56.304
- Okay, Ben.

23:56.347 --> 23:57.087
- Sit down.

24:41.131 --> 24:41.958
- Hey, Johnny.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.787
You can hear them too, right?

24:44.831 --> 24:46.006
- Yes.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.442
- They frighten you?

24:48.617 --> 24:49.400
- No.

24:49.444 --> 24:50.750
They're my friends.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.229
I play with them.

24:52.273 --> 24:53.709
- Can your mom and dad see them?

24:53.753 --> 24:54.536
- No.

24:55.581 --> 24:56.407
- Listen.

24:57.626 --> 25:00.237
Don't play with things
only you can see.

25:00.281 --> 25:01.804
It can be very dangerous.

25:01.848 --> 25:02.936
- But they protect me.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.241
- From what?

25:04.285 --> 25:05.025
- Ali.

25:05.068 --> 25:06.113
- Who's Ali?

25:06.156 --> 25:07.375
- Ali's the doll eater.

25:08.724 --> 25:09.812
- Is that Ali?

25:09.856 --> 25:11.379
- This is Karen.

25:11.422 --> 25:12.336
She's a friend.

25:14.034 --> 25:15.296
Ali's the bad one.

25:15.339 --> 25:16.515
She's behind you.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.825
- Listen, don't fool around
with these things, okay?

25:22.869 --> 25:24.523
They may be your friends now

25:24.566 --> 25:26.873
but only until bad
things start to happen.

25:27.743 --> 25:28.527
Okay?

25:28.570 --> 25:30.006
So stay away from it.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.139
I may not see things
as much as you do

25:32.182 --> 25:34.576
but I can sense them
and I can hear them.

25:35.795 --> 25:38.449
Here, take this.

25:38.493 --> 25:40.626
This will ward off evil spirits.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.715
So whenever you're
frightened, okay?

25:42.758 --> 25:44.891
And then stare at
what scares you

25:44.934 --> 25:48.329
and focus with all your heart
at what's in front of you.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.462
And then you count to 13.

25:51.506 --> 25:52.507
Okay?

25:52.551 --> 25:53.421
- Okay.

25:53.464 --> 25:54.727
- Let's go ahead and try it.

25:56.380 --> 25:57.164
- One.

25:58.513 --> 26:00.428
Two.

26:00.471 --> 26:01.168
Three.

26:01.211 --> 26:01.951
- Yes.

26:01.995 --> 26:02.735
- Four.

26:02.778 --> 26:03.562
- That's good.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.388
- Five.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.590
- Thank you.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.520
Jennifer Burrows.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.435
- Jen, it's Benny.

26:51.479 --> 26:54.395
- Ben, I said try calling first.

26:54.438 --> 26:55.918
- Well, I
want to see my son.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.181
- He's not your son,
we've been over this.

26:58.225 --> 27:00.053
Stanley is the father.

27:00.096 --> 27:01.402
- I don't
believe it, I'm sorry.

27:01.445 --> 27:02.708
I just don't believe it.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.884
- Because you were
a mistake, Ben.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.537
And I'm sorry to
have to say this,

27:06.581 --> 27:08.670
but Stanley and I
have been picking up

27:08.714 --> 27:10.890
the pieces ever since.

27:10.933 --> 27:12.500
- Why do
you even say this?

27:12.543 --> 27:14.241
Why am I a mistake?

27:14.284 --> 27:15.503
- He's not your biological son.

27:15.546 --> 27:17.418
Stanley is Johnny's father.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.637
Let it go, Ben.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.118
- We've
never done a DNA test.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.467
We've never done it.

27:23.511 --> 27:24.860
That's all I'm saying.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.601
We've never done it.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.342
- Well, that's all
really great to hear

27:28.385 --> 27:30.213
but I don't have time to
get into this right now

27:30.257 --> 27:31.780
so I'll give you a
call back when I do.

27:31.824 --> 27:32.607
- But--

27:32.651 --> 27:33.652
- Take care of yourself.

27:33.695 --> 27:34.478
- No, hold on--

27:47.709 --> 27:48.841
- Johnny.

27:51.582 --> 27:52.627
Johnny.

27:59.460 --> 28:03.507
Come play with us, Johnny,
before Ali comes back.

28:08.948 --> 28:12.299
Don't you want to play with us?

28:12.342 --> 28:14.127
Don't let Ali get you.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.783
She will hurt you.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.567
And take your soul.

28:19.610 --> 28:22.526
And then she'll turn
you into a doll.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.790
Like us.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.356
- Who are you?

28:26.400 --> 28:28.271
- Don't let Ali get you.

28:31.231 --> 28:35.017
- One, two, three, four--

28:35.061 --> 28:36.627
- She will hurt you.

28:36.671 --> 28:37.628
- Five.

28:37.672 --> 28:40.109
- Don't let Ali get you.

28:41.328 --> 28:43.330
- Six, seven, eight.

28:43.373 --> 28:45.375
- She will hurt you.

28:45.419 --> 28:46.812
- Nine, 10.

28:46.855 --> 28:50.032
- And she'll
take your soul, like us.

28:50.076 --> 28:55.081
- 11, 12.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.344
13.

28:57.387 --> 29:00.303
- And then she'll turn
you into a doll just like us.

29:04.525 --> 29:05.744
- Johnny?

29:05.787 --> 29:07.615
What are you doing in here?

29:07.658 --> 29:09.486
- I, I...

29:12.533 --> 29:14.753
- You know, Johnny, you shouldn't
be going in the cabinet.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.060
Things are in there.

29:18.104 --> 29:20.541
Wouldn't want you
to lose anything.

29:20.584 --> 29:21.585
- I didn't.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.938
- Been going
through my stuff?

29:25.981 --> 29:26.765
- Yes.

29:46.654 --> 29:49.048
- It's okay, Johnny.

29:49.091 --> 29:52.399
I did tell you not to touch
anything without my permission.

29:52.442 --> 29:53.226
Remember?

29:54.053 --> 29:54.836
- Yes.

29:59.232 --> 30:00.450
- This is where I work.

30:03.366 --> 30:04.672
This is how I make money.

30:08.850 --> 30:09.764
You mess anything up,

30:11.331 --> 30:15.074
we won't have any money to
pay for food, this house.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.775
I just need you to
understand that.

30:23.647 --> 30:24.431
- Yes sir.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.306
- Okay, so you
won't do it again.

30:31.177 --> 30:31.917
Right?

30:31.960 --> 30:32.787
- Yes sir.

30:35.572 --> 30:36.312
- Okay.

30:37.574 --> 30:38.314
Good.

30:49.543 --> 30:50.979
- Stanley.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.493
- Hey, honey.

31:26.536 --> 31:27.842
What's going on?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.017
- Hi, Mom.

31:29.061 --> 31:31.063
Dad said not to disturb
him, he's working.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.891
- Oh, well, that's probably
because he's excited

31:32.934 --> 31:34.936
about his new
writing assignment.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.982
Want to help me put
away some groceries?

31:37.983 --> 31:39.898
Put some bagels in the pantry.

31:41.508 --> 31:42.770
Come on, up and at 'em.

31:49.342 --> 31:50.647
- Mom, when we're finished,

31:50.691 --> 31:52.214
can I go play with
the other children?

31:54.651 --> 31:55.957
- What other children, Johnny?

31:57.654 --> 31:58.829
What do you mean?

31:58.873 --> 32:00.701
- Just the children
of the house, Mom.

32:00.744 --> 32:01.876
They're mostly nice.

32:02.877 --> 32:05.053
- Are you seeing these
children, Johnny?

32:05.097 --> 32:07.664
- No ma'am, I'm
just hearing them.

32:07.708 --> 32:08.752
- Uh huh, okay.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.104
I have an idea.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.366
Why don't we go take a
walk around this house

32:13.409 --> 32:15.281
and see what's
behind these voices?

32:15.324 --> 32:16.325
What do you say?

32:16.369 --> 32:17.109
- Okay.

32:17.152 --> 32:17.936
- Okay.

32:17.979 --> 32:19.676
You lead the way.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.113
Alright.

32:21.156 --> 32:22.853
Show me what these
voices are about.

32:22.897 --> 32:24.333
I think I've got an answer.

33:33.968 --> 33:35.013
- Alright.

34:06.305 --> 34:07.523
Exterior, day.

34:12.137 --> 34:15.705
A pleasant family walks towards
a house in the countryside.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.802
This house is special.

34:25.846 --> 34:29.067
Something about it
draws the man near it.

34:32.157 --> 34:36.074
A man paints the doorway
just as they approach.

34:40.947 --> 34:43.036
- Alright, so this
is an old home

34:43.081 --> 34:44.908
and with old homes,
you get unusual sounds.

34:44.952 --> 34:47.041
It's part of their charm.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.476
And here we have the attic.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.697
I don't know where
the light switch is.

34:51.741 --> 34:53.569
- It's a little dark.

34:53.612 --> 34:54.396
- I got a plan.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.704
Aha.

34:57.747 --> 34:59.009
This should work.

35:00.576 --> 35:01.316
Okay.

35:03.144 --> 35:03.884
Aha.

35:03.927 --> 35:05.320
See this?

35:05.364 --> 35:09.759
Okay, so this right
here is a furnace.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.892
It's also an air
conditioning unit.

35:11.935 --> 35:14.286
And the air conditioning unit
pulls water out of the air

35:14.329 --> 35:16.418
in the form of condensation.

35:16.462 --> 35:20.727
And sometimes these things
have a gurgling sound.

35:20.770 --> 35:22.076
Let's see if we can hear it.

35:22.990 --> 35:23.904
Uh huh, do you hear that?

35:23.947 --> 35:25.427
- Uh huh.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.777
- Kinda sounds like when
Mom's gargling with mouthwash?

35:27.821 --> 35:30.258
It gets louder
sometimes, like at night,

35:30.302 --> 35:33.087
and downstairs that's gonna
sound like a human being.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.308
But it's just the water swirling
around up in this thing.

35:36.351 --> 35:37.135
- Okay.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.048
- Okay?

35:38.092 --> 35:39.137
See what else we can find.

35:40.312 --> 35:42.183
Need to find a light,
that's for sure.

35:43.402 --> 35:47.145
Okay, see what we
have over here.

35:47.188 --> 35:48.407
Looks like another room.

35:49.756 --> 35:50.496
- I'm so sorry.

35:50.539 --> 35:51.714
- Johann, hi.

35:51.758 --> 35:53.673
- Didn't mean to scare you, hi.

35:53.716 --> 35:54.978
- No, no, it's okay.

35:55.022 --> 35:56.154
- I was just fixing some
of these faulty wires.

35:56.197 --> 35:57.285
I'm almost done,
give me one second.

35:57.329 --> 35:58.199
- Can you see?

36:01.202 --> 36:02.769
- Ah, there we go.

36:02.812 --> 36:03.639
- There we go, that's beautiful.

36:03.683 --> 36:04.945
So much better.

36:04.988 --> 36:06.033
Thank you.

36:06.076 --> 36:07.295
- You're welcome.

36:07.339 --> 36:08.862
- We're just taking a
little tour of the house

36:08.905 --> 36:11.517
to figure out where all
these sounds are coming from.

36:11.560 --> 36:12.735
- You bet, go right ahead.

36:12.779 --> 36:13.780
- Thank you.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.827
- Oh, and if you need
anything, I'll be around.

36:17.871 --> 36:18.828
- Okay.

36:18.872 --> 36:19.612
Thank you.

36:19.655 --> 36:20.613
- Thank you.

36:21.831 --> 36:23.877
- Okay, Johnny,
you see this pipe?

36:23.920 --> 36:26.053
This house is over
150 years old.

36:26.096 --> 36:27.228
That's pretty old, right?

36:27.272 --> 36:28.838
- That's older than you.

36:28.882 --> 36:32.015
- Oh, alright, you're
a funny guy today, huh?

36:32.059 --> 36:35.236
Well, 150 years ago, we
didn't have air conditioning

36:35.280 --> 36:38.326
or indoor plumbing, so
these pipes and the ducts

36:38.370 --> 36:40.023
are struggling to deal
with the air pressure

36:40.067 --> 36:42.156
and it makes sort
of a whistle sound.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.984
Or maybe sometimes
a whispering sound?

36:44.027 --> 36:44.724
- Mom.

36:44.767 --> 36:45.725
- Yes?

36:45.768 --> 36:46.639
- It really sounds like it.

36:46.682 --> 36:48.467
It really sounds like voices.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.077
- I know, but they're not.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.861
It's just.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.864
That's all it is, I promise you.

36:54.908 --> 36:55.648
Okay?

36:55.691 --> 36:56.953
- Okay.

36:56.997 --> 36:57.867
- And look at here,
there's all this wood.

36:57.911 --> 36:59.434
This house is made of wood,

36:59.478 --> 37:02.045
which is a material that absorbs
and shrinks with moisture.

37:02.089 --> 37:03.308
And when it expands and shrinks,

37:03.351 --> 37:05.701
it makes these creaking
and groaning sounds.

37:05.745 --> 37:07.790
So in the morning
when the sun comes up,

37:07.834 --> 37:11.359
all the water goes out of the
wood and the house shrinks.

37:11.403 --> 37:13.535
And then at night time...

37:13.579 --> 37:14.493
What do you got there?

37:14.536 --> 37:15.755
- Look what I found.

37:15.798 --> 37:17.235
- Oh.

37:17.278 --> 37:18.410
Let's check it out.

37:18.453 --> 37:20.890
At night time,
when it cools down,

37:20.934 --> 37:22.979
that same wood brings
in the moisture

37:23.023 --> 37:24.067
and it expands again.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.290
- Mom.

37:29.334 --> 37:30.248
- Yeah?

37:30.291 --> 37:31.118
- The bad girl's here.

37:31.161 --> 37:32.162
- Who?

37:32.206 --> 37:33.686
- Ali, the doll eater.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.296
- Oh.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.604
Well, that doesn't make any
sense, because she's not real.

37:38.647 --> 37:41.171
Do you remember what I
told you about ghosts

37:41.215 --> 37:43.348
and spirits and
things like that?

37:44.566 --> 37:46.829
- They're just figments
of my imagination.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.963
- That's right, and you have
a pretty amazing imagination,

37:50.006 --> 37:52.095
which is part of why I love you,

37:52.139 --> 37:53.706
but it's all make believe.

37:53.749 --> 37:56.448
Carrie just told us a scary
story but it's not real, okay?

37:56.491 --> 37:57.362
- Okay.

37:57.405 --> 37:58.319
- Promise you understand?

37:58.363 --> 37:59.146
- Yes ma'am.

37:59.189 --> 38:00.408
- Okay.

38:02.062 --> 38:03.585
I think that's
probably the gas man.

38:03.629 --> 38:05.805
Want to come with
me to let him in?

38:05.848 --> 38:06.632
Come on.

38:09.069 --> 38:10.418
- Johnny.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.509
Don't play with my dolls.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.905
Don't play with my dolls.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.042
- Don't hurt my friends.

38:48.369 --> 38:49.762
- The truth
is I'm here to see you,

38:49.805 --> 38:50.632
not the husband.

38:50.676 --> 38:52.330
You, not the husband.

38:58.727 --> 38:59.772
Come here, you.

38:59.815 --> 39:01.164
Stop running away from me.

39:01.208 --> 39:01.948
Come here.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.253
- Come on.

39:03.297 --> 39:04.516
- I'll chase
you around the world.

39:35.547 --> 39:39.159
♪ One, two, three,
come play with me ♪

39:41.291 --> 39:43.381
- Just calm down.

39:43.424 --> 39:46.340
♪ Four, five, six

39:48.255 --> 39:50.170
- Ben, I
don't know what we did,

39:50.213 --> 39:51.824
I don't know anything.

39:51.867 --> 39:53.347
- Relax.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.873
Stanley doesn't know
anything, relax.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.398
- I gotta
pull it together.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.008
I gotta pull it together.

40:02.051 --> 40:03.531
- Keep it together.

40:03.575 --> 40:04.402
Breath.

40:07.274 --> 40:09.407
Just know that I love you.

40:23.377 --> 40:26.206
- I'm
telling you, calm down.

40:26.249 --> 40:27.555
Just calm down.

40:31.646 --> 40:33.866
Forget about him, alright?

41:02.547 --> 41:04.200
- Johnny.

41:06.376 --> 41:07.160
Johnny.

41:09.336 --> 41:10.119
Over here.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.601
Look in the box.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.474
Johnny.

41:18.214 --> 41:19.389
Look in the box.

41:21.957 --> 41:23.959
Johnny, look in the box.

41:27.833 --> 41:32.838
Look in the box, Johnny.

41:57.602 --> 41:58.733
- Hey, Johnny.

42:00.343 --> 42:01.388
Whatcha looking at?

42:03.303 --> 42:04.609
Ah, it's this Ali stuff, huh?

42:07.437 --> 42:10.440
You know that this happened a
really, really long time ago?

42:11.354 --> 42:12.921
Good.

42:12.965 --> 42:15.924
And this Ali girl, she had
a really, really bad father.

42:17.752 --> 42:18.536
- Yes, Mom.

42:18.579 --> 42:20.015
Yes.

42:20.059 --> 42:21.451
- Okay, good.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.021
- Hello, Johnny.

42:26.065 --> 42:26.805
- Hello.

42:28.937 --> 42:30.504
- Johnny, who are
you talking to?

42:31.723 --> 42:32.898
- It's just my friends.

42:35.204 --> 42:36.989
- Baby, are you seeing things?

42:37.032 --> 42:38.207
- I don't see them.

42:38.251 --> 42:40.035
- Then why are you saying hello?

42:40.079 --> 42:41.428
- I hear them, Mommy.

42:41.471 --> 42:42.908
- What do you hear?

42:42.951 --> 42:44.692
- The voices, they're
talking to me.

42:46.476 --> 42:48.043
- Okay, baby.

42:48.087 --> 42:50.132
I know you're probably so
lonely out here, right?

42:50.176 --> 42:51.481
But you know what,
when school starts,

42:51.525 --> 42:52.831
you're gonna have
so many new friends.

42:52.874 --> 42:54.093
And I want you to
know something.

42:54.136 --> 42:56.878
You are not hearing
voices, okay?

42:56.922 --> 42:57.923
- Okay.

42:57.966 --> 42:59.272
- Alright.

42:59.315 --> 43:02.405
- Let's be
friends forever.

43:02.449 --> 43:04.407
- It's okay, Mommy,
they won't do anything.

43:07.062 --> 43:08.586
I don't like Dad's dolls.

43:09.935 --> 43:11.980
- Yeah, they're
pretty creepy, huh?

43:12.024 --> 43:13.242
- It's not that.

43:13.286 --> 43:14.156
They hurt.

43:15.375 --> 43:16.376
- They hurt?

43:16.419 --> 43:17.377
- My friends.

43:18.683 --> 43:20.641
They told me Ali
keeps them there,

43:20.685 --> 43:22.643
imprisons them in those dolls.

43:22.687 --> 43:25.124
All they do is want
to play but Ali--

43:25.167 --> 43:27.517
- Ali, no more talk about
this Ali girl, alright?

43:27.561 --> 43:30.085
Okay, this stuff that you hear.

43:30.129 --> 43:31.434
I know you hear a lot of things,

43:31.478 --> 43:33.219
you hear a lot of things
that adults talk about.

43:33.262 --> 43:34.481
It is not real, okay?

43:34.524 --> 43:35.395
- Okay.

43:35.438 --> 43:36.657
- They're just dolls.

43:36.701 --> 43:37.440
- Yes ma'am.

43:37.484 --> 43:38.528
- Inanimate objects.

43:39.617 --> 43:40.879
And here's the
other funny thing.

43:40.922 --> 43:43.446
Sometimes when something
terrible happens,

43:43.490 --> 43:46.406
if you talk about it too
much, you start to believe it.

43:47.973 --> 43:49.539
You understand?

43:49.583 --> 43:50.889
- Yes ma'am.

43:50.932 --> 43:51.716
- Good.

43:56.372 --> 44:00.942
Alright, let's just relax a
little bit and watch some TV.

44:02.465 --> 44:03.510
Okay?

44:05.860 --> 44:06.687
- Look at that.

44:07.862 --> 44:08.646
- Yeah.

44:26.359 --> 44:27.621
Snug as a bug in a rug.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.623
I think we're all set.

44:29.667 --> 44:30.798
Good night, honey, bedtime.

44:32.539 --> 44:33.714
Good night, honey.

44:33.758 --> 44:34.672
- Mom?

44:34.715 --> 44:36.238
- Yes?

44:36.282 --> 44:39.633
- Before you leave, can you
check under my bed for monsters?

44:39.677 --> 44:42.462
- Yes, I can check under
the bed for monsters.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.639
Do you think I'm gonna find one?

44:45.683 --> 44:46.684
Here we go.

44:48.947 --> 44:50.426
Guess what?

44:53.734 --> 44:56.737
Absolutely nothing,
you silly man.

44:56.781 --> 44:57.738
There's nothing under there.

44:57.782 --> 44:59.958
You need to go to sleep

45:00.001 --> 45:02.612
and I'll be right down the hall
if you need anything, okay?

45:02.656 --> 45:03.439
- Okay.

45:13.841 --> 45:14.712
- Johnny.

45:16.844 --> 45:18.237
Come play with me.

45:19.891 --> 45:22.545
- Mom and Joe say we
shouldn't play together.

45:22.589 --> 45:24.765
- Why, Johnny?

45:24.809 --> 45:26.201
Come on, Johnny.

45:28.508 --> 45:30.815
I thought we were friends.

45:30.858 --> 45:32.860
- One, two, three, four.

45:43.479 --> 45:44.829
- Johnny.

45:53.185 --> 45:54.316
Play with me!

45:59.626 --> 46:01.759
- Five, six, seven, eight.

46:18.601 --> 46:19.733
- Johnny boy.

46:22.040 --> 46:23.737
What'd we talk about?

46:31.484 --> 46:32.964
I'd rather you didn't lie to me.

46:35.836 --> 46:37.838
Okay if you did.

46:37.882 --> 46:39.884
Not gonna be mad.

46:39.927 --> 46:41.668
- But it's the truth.

46:46.194 --> 46:47.979
- Tell me how this
got in your room.

46:50.546 --> 46:52.331
Did your mom put it here?

46:52.374 --> 46:53.245
- No.

46:53.288 --> 46:55.073
- Then why is it in here?

46:55.116 --> 46:55.856
- Stanley?

46:58.424 --> 46:59.599
Hey.

46:59.642 --> 47:00.818
What's going on in here?

47:03.472 --> 47:05.605
- Johnny and I are just having
a little father son talk.

47:07.302 --> 47:09.478
- Okay, remember he's
only eight years old.

47:11.480 --> 47:13.265
- Jennifer, darling,

47:15.310 --> 47:16.834
I'm just trying to make
you both understand

47:16.877 --> 47:19.793
that when I'm working, it
takes a lot of concentration.

47:21.012 --> 47:22.883
Concentration that's
easily broken.

47:24.624 --> 47:26.756
I don't decide when
my mind wants to work,

47:26.800 --> 47:28.149
so when it does,

47:30.804 --> 47:32.719
it's important that
I'm left alone.

47:45.688 --> 47:46.820
- I love you.

47:46.864 --> 47:48.300
- Love you too, Mom.

47:48.343 --> 47:49.779
- Get some sleep.

47:49.823 --> 47:50.606
- Okay.

48:04.751 --> 48:05.883
- Hey, guys.

48:05.926 --> 48:07.667
It's 10 in the morning,
what's going on?

48:07.710 --> 48:09.147
- Mr. Burrows said no more work.

48:09.190 --> 48:10.452
- No, what do you
mean no more work?

48:10.496 --> 48:12.063
We still need this
house to be painted.

48:12.106 --> 48:14.761
- He said you're on a very tight
budget so we're packing up.

48:14.804 --> 48:15.588
- Our budget's fine.

48:15.631 --> 48:16.502
I'll talk to him.

48:16.545 --> 48:18.460
- To be honest, Mrs. Burrows,

48:18.504 --> 48:21.028
the workers themselves
aren't too upset.

48:21.072 --> 48:22.856
- Why aren't they upset?

48:22.900 --> 48:23.944
- Something about the house.

48:23.988 --> 48:24.771
Superstitions.

48:24.814 --> 48:25.772
- Ah, superstitions.

48:25.815 --> 48:27.687
You mean old wives tales.

48:27.730 --> 48:30.342
- No, something about
bad memories and demons.

48:30.385 --> 48:31.821
I wouldn't give it
too much credit.

48:31.865 --> 48:33.823
- I certainly don't,
Johann, and I'd be surprised

48:33.867 --> 48:35.173
if a grown man like
you actually believes

48:35.216 --> 48:36.609
in children's fairy tales.

48:37.871 --> 48:39.742
- I don't,
but people ae funny.

48:40.918 --> 48:43.485
- Respectfully, Johann,
I'm a neurophysicist

48:43.529 --> 48:44.791
and as you can imagine,

48:44.834 --> 48:46.924
these types of stories,
and they are stories,

48:46.967 --> 48:49.535
they don't sit
very well with me.

48:49.578 --> 48:53.017
I live here and I can assure
you there are no ghosts

48:53.060 --> 48:53.843
in this house.

48:55.236 --> 48:56.237
- Mrs. Burrows.

48:56.281 --> 48:58.587
You have a really nice family.

48:58.631 --> 49:01.242
So if you ever need
my help, please call.

49:03.766 --> 49:06.769
- Hey, Joe, whatcha doing?

49:06.813 --> 49:09.772
- I'm just packing up
like you told us to, sir.

49:09.816 --> 49:13.951
- Well, looks like you're
all packed up, so thank you.

49:15.604 --> 49:16.431
Bye, Joe.

49:18.651 --> 49:20.392
- I'll see you soon, Johann.

49:20.435 --> 49:21.219
- Yeah.

49:24.787 --> 49:25.571
- Really?

49:31.098 --> 49:33.535
- So you think he fancies you?

49:34.928 --> 49:36.103
- I don't know, Stanley,

49:36.147 --> 49:37.757
I'd like to think
I'm still attractive.

49:37.800 --> 49:38.801
Hey!

49:38.845 --> 49:39.977
- Was he being inappropriate?

49:40.020 --> 49:42.718
- No, of course he wasn't.

49:42.762 --> 49:43.893
I love you.

49:43.937 --> 49:44.677
Stop this.

49:52.424 --> 49:54.556
What was all that
about, Stanley?

49:54.600 --> 49:57.472
- You know how I feel about
guys getting too close to you.

49:58.604 --> 49:59.822
- He wasn't doing anything.

49:59.866 --> 50:01.824
- Alright, well, I've
heard that before.

50:03.435 --> 50:04.784
I'm sorry, okay?

50:04.827 --> 50:05.915
It's just, it's hard.

50:06.873 --> 50:07.656
- I know.

50:09.136 --> 50:10.398
It was a long time ago.

50:14.098 --> 50:15.490
- You talk to him recently?

50:19.538 --> 50:20.321
Yeah.

50:22.845 --> 50:25.805
- Stanley, you have nothing
to worry about, okay?

50:25.848 --> 50:27.850
I told you I'd stay with
you an entire lifetime

50:27.894 --> 50:29.896
to work this out and I meant it.

50:29.939 --> 50:33.030
I know how long something
like this can take to heal.

50:34.379 --> 50:37.860
If it takes another 10 years,
it's fine because I love you.

50:37.904 --> 50:39.949
I love you so much and only you.

50:43.475 --> 50:47.087
Can you just please try to
remember it's not Johnny's fault?

50:47.131 --> 50:48.306
- I know.

50:48.349 --> 50:50.047
Look, I just, the
stress is getting to me

50:50.090 --> 50:52.005
and just bringing up
old memories, alright?

50:52.919 --> 50:54.486
- I know.

50:54.529 --> 50:56.879
And I know how much writing
takes it out of you too.

50:58.925 --> 50:59.926
I get it.

51:12.112 --> 51:14.288
- We don't have the money.

51:16.116 --> 51:17.291
- What do you mean we
don't have the money?

51:17.335 --> 51:18.640
You mean the money's
coming in late?

51:18.684 --> 51:19.946
- No, Jen, we're not
getting the advance.

51:19.989 --> 51:21.252
The studio screwed us over.

51:21.295 --> 51:22.166
- What?

51:22.209 --> 51:23.254
- They want me to write it fist

51:23.297 --> 51:24.777
and then maybe they'll buy it.

51:24.820 --> 51:26.909
- No, no, you gotta talk
to Ben, you gotta get--

51:26.953 --> 51:28.172
- Ben doesn't give a shit.

51:29.695 --> 51:31.088
If I don't finish this script,

51:32.219 --> 51:35.048
I don't know what the
hell I'm gonna do.

51:35.092 --> 51:37.964
- It's okay, I've got quite a
bit of money saved up actually

51:38.007 --> 51:40.619
so I can just float
us in the interim.

51:40.662 --> 51:42.534
Cut a couple corners,
we'll be fine.

51:42.577 --> 51:43.317
- Don't, don't.

51:43.361 --> 51:44.579
- Stop stressing out.

51:44.623 --> 51:46.973
- Don't want you
paying for everything.

51:47.016 --> 51:47.756
- I don't mind.

51:48.670 --> 51:50.063
We're not going back.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.631
We're staying here
together as a family.

51:52.674 --> 51:54.894
Gonna stick it out through
thick and through thin.

51:57.375 --> 51:58.898
- I appreciate that, Jen.

51:58.941 --> 52:01.118
The only way is for me
to finish this script.

52:28.971 --> 52:32.018
- Look at
the car he drives.

52:34.194 --> 52:36.065
Stanley, it's Benny.

52:36.109 --> 52:37.937
Your favorite agent.

52:42.289 --> 52:44.813
- He gets a
car, shit house.

52:44.857 --> 52:46.989
- And look
at your beautiful place.

52:49.688 --> 52:51.037
- Yes then.

52:55.172 --> 52:56.999
What's that guy gonna do?

52:57.043 --> 52:58.000
- They love it.

52:58.044 --> 52:59.524
It went great.

52:59.567 --> 53:03.397
I'm telling ya, I could
really do anything.

53:03.441 --> 53:06.444
- A beautiful
thriller, slasher?

53:07.619 --> 53:09.098
- This is a
very special customer.

53:09.142 --> 53:10.883
- Don't forget,
if you buy the house,

53:10.926 --> 53:12.406
you buy me too.

53:12.450 --> 53:13.233
I'll be around.

53:13.277 --> 53:14.060
I'm always here.

53:15.583 --> 53:18.412
- Well, the legal
term is emotionally defect.

53:22.155 --> 53:23.025
- Stanley, you're
talking about the old days.

53:23.069 --> 53:24.984
Nobody puts up advances anymore.

53:25.027 --> 53:26.246
It's a different time period.

53:26.290 --> 53:27.726
You actually have to
write the screenplay.

53:27.769 --> 53:29.641
We have to show it to them.

53:29.684 --> 53:33.166
- What, so.

53:33.210 --> 53:35.081
Jennifer's not lying to me.

53:35.124 --> 53:36.213
He is my son.

53:38.867 --> 53:41.653
Boy, do you feel
good in my hands.

53:43.481 --> 53:44.569
- The truth
is I came to see you,

53:44.612 --> 53:46.048
not the husband.

53:46.875 --> 53:48.094
- The worst slasher,

53:48.137 --> 53:49.574
best slasher thriller
they've ever seen.

53:49.617 --> 53:50.749
I'm the best.

53:57.930 --> 53:59.105
Want to get excited
about something?

53:59.148 --> 54:00.498
Okay.

54:00.541 --> 54:01.673
How about that?

54:01.716 --> 54:02.500
What's in here?

54:03.631 --> 54:05.938
Creepy dolls, huh?

54:05.981 --> 54:07.156
This is a sign.

54:07.200 --> 54:08.897
- This
is clearly a sign.

54:10.072 --> 54:12.118
- How much
money I deserve?

54:13.293 --> 54:16.296
- Well,
looks like.

54:16.340 --> 54:17.123
Hi, Joe.

54:20.387 --> 54:23.085
- No, no, no,
Stanley's not losing his mind.

54:23.129 --> 54:26.350
Stanley is not schizophrenic,
he's just stressed out.

54:29.309 --> 54:31.093
- What's
he doing here anyway?

54:32.225 --> 54:33.661
- Stanley?

54:40.015 --> 54:41.190
- You know how I feel

54:41.234 --> 54:43.976
about guys getting
too close to you.

54:45.238 --> 54:46.979
- Stanley.

54:56.771 --> 55:01.689
Stanley.

55:03.561 --> 55:05.084
- Nope, okay.

55:05.127 --> 55:05.911
Look at the stairs.

55:05.954 --> 55:07.129
There we go.

55:07.173 --> 55:08.217
Alright, now why
don't you run upstairs

55:08.261 --> 55:09.654
and go take a shower?

55:09.697 --> 55:11.220
I'll fix us some lunch

55:11.264 --> 55:13.310
and when you finish, we'll
learn about some Roman numerals.

55:13.353 --> 55:14.659
Oh, and Johnny?

55:14.702 --> 55:16.269
Can you try to use your
own bathroom, please,

55:16.313 --> 55:17.575
because your dad doesn't like it

55:17.618 --> 55:19.403
when you leave your
stuff all over ours?

55:19.446 --> 55:20.273
- Okay, Mommy.

55:23.058 --> 55:24.190
- Don't take too long.

55:25.234 --> 55:26.279
- Okay.
- Okay.

55:29.195 --> 55:34.200
♪ One, two, three,
come play with me ♪

55:38.247 --> 55:43.252
♪ Four, five, six,
let's hide and seek ♪

55:44.689 --> 55:49.302
♪ Seven, eight, nine,
your soul is mine ♪

55:50.956 --> 55:52.653
- I don't wanna play.

55:56.396 --> 55:58.180
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

55:58.224 --> 56:00.095
Have you not taken a
shower yet, young man?

56:00.139 --> 56:02.402
- Mommy, they want
to play with me.

56:02.446 --> 56:03.185
- Who?

56:03.229 --> 56:04.317
- The children.

56:05.797 --> 56:07.320
- Johnny, we've talked about
this before, come here.

56:07.364 --> 56:10.149
There are no children in
the house except for you.

56:10.192 --> 56:11.368
- I'm scared.

56:12.978 --> 56:15.937
- This is not gonna get you
out of your shower, young man.

56:15.981 --> 56:17.286
- Can you come with me?

56:17.330 --> 56:18.070
Please?

56:20.464 --> 56:21.595
- Okay.

56:21.639 --> 56:23.162
Just because you're
so darn cute.

56:23.205 --> 56:23.945
Come on.

56:23.989 --> 56:24.816
We gotta hurry.

56:30.909 --> 56:33.825
- Stanley.

56:33.868 --> 56:35.043
Stanley.

56:35.087 --> 56:36.523
What are you doing?

56:36.567 --> 56:37.872
Listen to them.

56:38.699 --> 56:39.483
They know.

56:42.834 --> 56:44.705
- I know, I know.

58:05.525 --> 58:08.746
- Jennifer, concentration,
concentration,

58:08.789 --> 58:11.226
concentration, concentration.

58:11.270 --> 58:13.794
You know I don't like to be
bothered when I'm working.

58:17.494 --> 58:18.407
Those are my things.

58:18.451 --> 58:19.191
Where were they?

58:19.234 --> 58:21.193
- Under your son's bed.

58:21.236 --> 58:23.282
Stanley, I know you need
to focus on your work

58:23.325 --> 58:25.153
but Johnny needs
his father as well.

58:25.197 --> 58:28.069
I am tired of you being so goddamn
selfish and irresponsible

58:28.113 --> 58:29.593
with our child.

58:29.636 --> 58:30.898
- Jennifer.

58:30.942 --> 58:33.118
I'm writing something
very, very special.

58:33.161 --> 58:36.208
I don't have time to play
with an eight year old.

58:38.471 --> 58:39.733
- Okay.

58:39.777 --> 58:42.431
He's not just any eight
year old, he's our son.

58:42.475 --> 58:46.392
Stanley, you're talking about
our son and he needs you.

58:46.435 --> 58:48.525
- What I need is for
you to let me work

58:48.568 --> 58:50.483
so I can finish
this goddamn script

58:50.527 --> 58:53.181
to pay for this goddamn
house that you got us into.

59:01.015 --> 59:03.148
You know, why don't
you go get on the phone

59:03.191 --> 59:05.454
with your little scientist
friends and play doctor

59:05.498 --> 59:07.674
so I can focus and
make some real money

59:07.718 --> 59:09.328
to keep this family together?

59:09.371 --> 59:11.199
- Don't you dare, Stanley.

59:11.243 --> 59:12.418
- I put food on this table,

59:12.461 --> 59:13.941
I put this roof over our heads,

59:13.985 --> 59:15.334
and I gotta finish this script.

59:15.377 --> 59:16.901
And every time you come in here

59:16.944 --> 59:18.903
and throw your little
tantrums, it distracts me!

59:26.998 --> 59:28.652
- Okay, Stanley.

59:28.695 --> 59:29.522
Okay.

59:32.264 --> 59:33.831
You focus on your work.

59:33.874 --> 59:35.049
You finish that script

59:36.616 --> 59:38.270
and know your family's waiting
for you when you're done.

59:39.793 --> 59:41.229
And we love you.

59:46.452 --> 59:47.714
Work.

59:47.758 --> 59:48.585
Put a page down.

01:00:02.555 --> 01:00:04.035
Hey, honey.

01:00:04.078 --> 01:00:05.253
You showered.

01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:07.908
- Mom.

01:00:09.344 --> 01:00:10.781
Why is Dad so mad all the time?

01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:13.435
- Um...

01:00:14.828 --> 01:00:17.222
He's under a lot,
a lot of stress

01:00:17.265 --> 01:00:20.007
and he's not
handling it so well.

01:00:20.051 --> 01:00:23.054
But I know deep down, he's doing
what he can for the family.

01:00:24.185 --> 01:00:25.752
He's trying his best for us

01:00:25.796 --> 01:00:27.667
so we just gotta
bear with him, okay?

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:28.929
- Okay.

01:00:28.973 --> 01:00:30.627
- Did you hear
some of that fight?

01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:35.544
It's gonna be okay.

01:00:35.588 --> 01:00:38.635
How 'bout we go downstairs
and I make you some hot cocoa?

01:00:39.505 --> 01:00:40.332
Yeah?

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:41.638
Okay, let's do that.

01:00:55.695 --> 01:01:00.657
- I don't care
about the.

01:01:02.136 --> 01:01:05.226
I did everything I
did for my decision.

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:06.271
Who creates my decision?

01:01:06.314 --> 01:01:07.098
I do.

01:01:10.623 --> 01:01:12.103
Put it on a page.

01:01:12.146 --> 01:01:14.758
What I put on the page becomes
what I do in real life.

01:01:21.982 --> 01:01:26.987
- Soul, soul she
can turn into a doll...

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:34.081
- Johnny.

01:01:37.737 --> 01:01:42.133
- I'm the one who
wants to do everything, okay?

01:01:42.176 --> 01:01:43.525
With my script.

01:02:05.373 --> 01:02:06.461
- Johnny.

01:02:09.638 --> 01:02:10.422
Johnny.

01:02:15.688 --> 01:02:16.558
Wake up!

01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:23.087
- Go away.

01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:25.176
Please go away, go away.

01:02:25.219 --> 01:02:26.220
Go, go away.

01:02:27.569 --> 01:02:29.702
- Johnny.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:32.009
- Go away.

01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:33.532
- Come with me.

01:02:33.575 --> 01:02:35.490
I'm gonna make you mine.

01:02:35.534 --> 01:02:36.578
- No.

01:02:36.622 --> 01:02:38.580
- I'm coming for you.

01:02:38.624 --> 01:02:42.019
- Go away,
you're not real.

01:02:42.062 --> 01:02:43.063
No, go away.

01:02:45.022 --> 01:02:45.892
Go away.

01:02:45.936 --> 01:02:47.372
You're not real.

01:02:50.636 --> 01:02:53.726
- I'm
gonna make you mine.

01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:55.859
Johnny.

01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:01.081
I'm gonna make you mine.

01:03:08.741 --> 01:03:10.177
- God, Stanley.

01:03:10.221 --> 01:03:10.961
- She's here.

01:03:11.004 --> 01:03:11.788
- Who's here?

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:13.615
Stanley, stop this.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.270
Johnny?

01:03:16.314 --> 01:03:17.706
Johnny, baby, what's wrong?

01:03:18.707 --> 01:03:20.884
What's wrong, baby, you
have another nightmare?

01:03:20.927 --> 01:03:21.754
Honey?

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:25.279
Baby, what you looking at?

01:03:27.455 --> 01:03:28.326
What are you looking at?

01:03:28.369 --> 01:03:29.936
Did you have another nightmare?

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:31.720
There's nothing there.

01:03:31.764 --> 01:03:34.593
It's okay.

01:03:34.636 --> 01:03:37.770
Stanley, come here, Johnny's
had another nightmare.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.641
- The boy needs toughening up.

01:03:39.685 --> 01:03:42.731
- He's a child, Stanley, what
the hell has gotten into you?

01:03:42.775 --> 01:03:46.300
- He always will be one if you
keep treating him like this.

01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:47.127
- Go away.

01:03:49.347 --> 01:03:51.479
It's okay, baby, it's okay.

01:03:51.523 --> 01:03:53.177
Hey, look at me.

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.832
Look at me, give me those eyes.

01:03:57.268 --> 01:03:58.660
Let's lie down.

01:03:58.704 --> 01:03:59.661
I'm right here.

01:03:59.705 --> 01:04:00.793
Not leaving you, okay?

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.841
Hey.

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:10.020
Stanley, I am starting
to worry about you.

01:04:10.063 --> 01:04:11.238
You...

01:04:11.282 --> 01:04:13.110
You need to sleep.

01:04:13.153 --> 01:04:15.677
I think that's what's going on.

01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:18.202
Working too hard, you'll
feel better in the morning.

01:04:19.986 --> 01:04:22.989
- Better?

01:04:23.033 --> 01:04:25.687
Things have never been better.

01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:31.824
For once, I've hit on something
so powerful, so beautiful,

01:04:32.738 --> 01:04:34.348
it'll last for eternity.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:37.525
- Okay.

01:04:37.569 --> 01:04:38.831
Honey, I'm excited
about your writing

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:42.835
but you're starting
to act not right.

01:04:44.402 --> 01:04:47.144
Sleep deprivation alone can
cause hallucinations, okay,

01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:48.972
and you've been drinking
so much on top of it.

01:04:49.015 --> 01:04:51.713
I just really need you to rest.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.326
- Honey, my script is perfect.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.328
It's perfect.

01:05:00.853 --> 01:05:02.768
We can all be together forever.

01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:03.551
- Stanley.

01:05:03.595 --> 01:05:04.378
- She's come.

01:05:07.164 --> 01:05:11.342
She's come to take
us with all the rest.

01:05:11.385 --> 01:05:12.909
- Okay, baby.

01:05:12.952 --> 01:05:17.217
- The best part is, we'll
never have to worry ever again.

01:05:19.785 --> 01:05:20.873
- Okay, baby.

01:05:22.483 --> 01:05:24.790
Please just go get some rest.

01:08:01.338 --> 01:08:02.121
Johnny?

01:08:06.908 --> 01:08:08.388
Johnny?

01:08:08.432 --> 01:08:09.998
Stanley, Stanley.

01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:11.043
Stanley.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:11.870
Where is Johnny?

01:08:12.914 --> 01:08:14.351
- He's gone.

01:08:14.394 --> 01:08:15.874
- What do you mean he's gone?

01:08:15.917 --> 01:08:17.745
Johnny!

01:08:17.788 --> 01:08:19.486
He's not in here.

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:20.966
Where is Johnny?

01:08:21.966 --> 01:08:24.143
- He's here, in the house.

01:08:25.404 --> 01:08:26.145
Forever.

01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:28.626
- Stanley.

01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:29.975
I need you to snap
out of this right now.

01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:30.975
We are talking about our son.

01:08:31.019 --> 01:08:33.544
- He is not my son.

01:08:33.587 --> 01:08:35.241
- Johnny is your son!

01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:39.158
Johnny?

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:41.682
Johnny?

01:08:41.725 --> 01:08:44.032
Oh my god, where's Johnny?

01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:45.121
Where's Johnny?

01:08:51.779 --> 01:08:52.563
Johnny!

01:08:53.868 --> 01:08:54.652
Johnny!

01:08:56.609 --> 01:08:57.394
Johnny!

01:09:13.888 --> 01:09:14.671
Johnny!

01:09:27.814 --> 01:09:28.599
Johnny!

01:09:50.011 --> 01:09:51.970
Yes, I need to report
a missing child.

01:09:52.013 --> 01:09:54.581
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, please.

01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:57.410
- Stanley, I do not
like this behavior.

01:09:57.454 --> 01:10:01.545
- I told you, the house has
taken him, just like I wrote.

01:10:01.588 --> 01:10:04.156
- This is the alcohol talking
or whatever you're taking.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.201
This isn't you, Stanley.

01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:06.376
- No, this is very real.

01:10:06.419 --> 01:10:09.248
You can see it happening.

01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:11.772
- Did you do
something to our son?

01:10:14.253 --> 01:10:15.689
Did you do something to Johnny?

01:10:15.733 --> 01:10:17.256
- I know what happened to him

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:19.345
and even the children in
the house couldn't save him.

01:10:21.608 --> 01:10:22.479
Ali's got him.

01:10:22.522 --> 01:10:24.263
- Ali is dead, Stanley.

01:10:24.307 --> 01:10:27.005
- Ali, no, no, no, Ali
is very much alive.

01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:31.836
Brought back to life
with these hands.

01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:33.185
- You did not do that.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:36.144
You did not bring
Ali back to life.

01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:38.146
Johnny's very much alive too,

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:39.452
he's part of this house now.

01:10:40.888 --> 01:10:42.194
Just like the rest of us.

01:10:43.369 --> 01:10:44.718
- Look at me.

01:10:44.762 --> 01:10:46.416
I need you to tell me
why you're doing this.

01:10:48.853 --> 01:10:49.593
- Love.

01:10:51.943 --> 01:10:55.207
You see, I realized
that I have the power

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:58.732
to keep us together
for eternity.

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:02.083
- Tell me where Johnny is.

01:11:02.127 --> 01:11:03.868
- Quit worrying about that brat!

01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:10.222
Do you realize what I've done
to keep this family together?

01:11:11.919 --> 01:11:15.358
Johnny, Johnny is in
a better place now.

01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:21.059
Alright, you, my love, are next.

01:11:21.102 --> 01:11:22.147
- No.

01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:26.760
Stanley, tell me
where my son is.

01:11:26.804 --> 01:11:28.719
- So the
truth comes out, huh?

01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:30.938
Your son.

01:11:32.505 --> 01:11:33.376
- My son.

01:11:34.377 --> 01:11:35.421
My son.

01:11:36.422 --> 01:11:38.206
- Your son.

01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:42.298
Your son.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.632
- I got you now.

01:12:28.996 --> 01:12:30.258
- I still have no
idea where Johnny is

01:12:30.302 --> 01:12:31.695
and what happened to him.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.307
- Do me a favor.

01:12:37.309 --> 01:12:38.484
Put this on for me, please.

01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:43.228
Please?

01:12:49.277 --> 01:12:51.192
Jennifer, since I was last here,

01:12:51.236 --> 01:12:54.370
the energies in this
house have grown stronger.

01:12:54.413 --> 01:12:55.545
Where once there
was something amiss,

01:12:55.588 --> 01:12:57.285
clearly there's a
big problem now.

01:12:58.417 --> 01:13:00.463
- None of this makes
any sense to me.

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:04.205
- I know you've
been through a lot

01:13:04.249 --> 01:13:07.121
but you have to try
and understand me now.

01:13:07.165 --> 01:13:08.253
There are many spirits in here

01:13:08.296 --> 01:13:09.646
and I strongly believe

01:13:09.689 --> 01:13:13.345
that the bad spirit
I felt is a demon.

01:13:15.478 --> 01:13:17.131
- A demon.

01:13:17.175 --> 01:13:21.397
- I know it sounds silly but
I do know about these things.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.834
Spirits are entities that
at one point were alive

01:13:23.877 --> 01:13:25.749
and had a physical body.

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:28.491
Some can be good,
some can be bad.

01:13:28.534 --> 01:13:31.494
Demons, on the other hand,
never had a physical body.

01:13:31.537 --> 01:13:33.409
They come here
straight from hell.

01:13:34.671 --> 01:13:37.413
- You're saying that
a demon took my son.

01:13:38.849 --> 01:13:40.328
I don't believe that.

01:13:40.372 --> 01:13:42.026
I think that Stanley
is delusional

01:13:42.069 --> 01:13:44.202
and I think that Johnny
is somewhere in this house

01:13:44.245 --> 01:13:45.508
and that we need to find him.

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:50.295
- I know this may sound
very strange to you

01:13:50.338 --> 01:13:53.211
but some of us grew up being
taught these kind of things.

01:13:53.254 --> 01:13:55.213
Religion and practices
gave us the means

01:13:55.256 --> 01:13:57.345
to talk to the dead.

01:13:57.389 --> 01:14:00.697
Trust me, I learned a lot
watching my grandmother work.

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:03.961
We can try and communicate
with them if you like.

01:14:09.662 --> 01:14:11.316
- Let's try.

01:14:11.359 --> 01:14:12.143
- Okay.

01:14:27.506 --> 01:14:28.855
This is it.

01:14:28.899 --> 01:14:30.466
This is the source.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.381
- You mean where Ali died.

01:14:33.425 --> 01:14:34.513
- That's her.

01:14:35.427 --> 01:14:37.777
She's the demonic
spirit I sensed.

01:14:37.821 --> 01:14:39.649
And she has your son.

01:14:39.692 --> 01:14:40.563
- Where is he?

01:14:41.607 --> 01:14:42.521
- Impossible to tell.

01:14:42.565 --> 01:14:44.131
Too many energies in this house.

01:14:47.744 --> 01:14:48.919
- Okay, so what do we do?

01:14:48.962 --> 01:14:51.487
- We have to communicate
with the spirits.

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:55.316
But whatever we do, we
cannot engage the demon.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.971
They're devious and insidious
master manipulators.

01:15:00.626 --> 01:15:02.236
- I don't know how we do this.

01:15:04.238 --> 01:15:06.763
- Think of something that
only you and your son know.

01:15:09.548 --> 01:15:12.029
- We played a game.

01:15:12.072 --> 01:15:16.860
We made up a spelling game
only him and I know about.

01:15:16.903 --> 01:15:18.252
- Okay.

01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:19.036
- Would that work?

01:15:19.079 --> 01:15:19.819
- Sure.

01:15:19.863 --> 01:15:20.777
Let's give it a try.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:24.737
- This ball.

01:15:24.781 --> 01:15:27.871
Okay, just help me clear
a little bit of space.

01:15:29.002 --> 01:15:30.395
Just have to draw a diagram.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:34.442
And then...

01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:40.361
- It's an R.

01:15:40.405 --> 01:15:41.449
- An R, okay.

01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:45.802
- A U.

01:15:45.845 --> 01:15:46.759
- R-U.

01:15:46.803 --> 01:15:47.586
R-U?

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:48.413
- Uh huh.

01:15:50.023 --> 01:15:50.981
An N.

01:15:51.024 --> 01:15:52.591
- R-U-N.

01:15:54.332 --> 01:15:56.421
Oh my god, it's
telling us to run.

01:15:57.509 --> 01:15:58.379
Oh my god.

01:15:58.423 --> 01:15:59.555
- It wants us to be afraid.

01:15:59.598 --> 01:16:00.207
- He's telling me to run?

01:16:01.818 --> 01:16:05.038
- It cannot consume us until
we give into absolute fear.

01:16:05.082 --> 01:16:05.865
- Okay.

01:16:07.388 --> 01:16:09.477
Okay, what does Johnny have
to do with any of this?

01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:11.044
Why do they want my son?

01:16:11.088 --> 01:16:13.220
- Sometimes we're just victims
of the actions of others.

01:16:13.264 --> 01:16:15.440
Sins of our fathers, perhaps.

01:16:15.483 --> 01:16:17.442
- I just want my son back.

01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:22.403
Please, please, please.

01:16:26.538 --> 01:16:29.802
- So this is what you
do when I'm away, huh?

01:16:31.412 --> 01:16:33.110
This piece of shit.

01:16:33.153 --> 01:16:34.546
- No, Stanley,

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:36.722
you're just not understanding
things right now.

01:16:36.766 --> 01:16:39.290
- All I ever wanted was
for us to be a family.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:41.988
And yet you've gone
and done it again.

01:16:42.032 --> 01:16:43.599
- What are you talking about?

01:16:44.861 --> 01:16:49.692
- I guess once a cheater,
always a cheater, huh?

01:16:49.735 --> 01:16:51.345
- Stanley.

01:16:51.389 --> 01:16:52.433
It's not like that.

01:16:52.477 --> 01:16:54.261
It is not like that right now.

01:16:54.305 --> 01:16:55.523
- But you know what?

01:16:58.048 --> 01:17:02.226
I guess we're here to
work things out, huh?

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:30.471
Oh, Jennifer.

01:17:31.559 --> 01:17:33.039
Jennifer, Jennifer.

01:17:33.083 --> 01:17:34.562
Don't you understand, huh?

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:41.482
You wanted to be with Johnny,
now you can be with him.

01:17:41.526 --> 01:17:43.746
- Please let go of me, Stanley.

01:17:43.789 --> 01:17:45.530
Stanley, let go of me.

01:17:45.573 --> 01:17:46.444
- She's here in the house.

01:17:46.487 --> 01:17:48.402
You know that, don't you?

01:17:48.446 --> 01:17:51.275
- You can't take my
fear if I have none.

01:17:51.318 --> 01:17:54.974
- She promised me eternal
life for all of us.

01:17:56.367 --> 01:17:57.542
- No.

01:17:57.585 --> 01:18:00.545
You will not do this to us.

01:18:01.589 --> 01:18:02.982
- Stanley.

01:18:03.026 --> 01:18:04.462
Bring her to me.

01:18:05.768 --> 01:18:08.422
Stanley, bring her to me.

01:18:08.466 --> 01:18:10.555
- Take my fear if I have none.

01:18:10.598 --> 01:18:12.513
You can't take my fear.

01:18:38.452 --> 01:18:39.627
- Jen.

01:18:39.671 --> 01:18:40.716
- Stanley.

01:18:41.804 --> 01:18:43.719
It's okay, it's okay.

01:18:46.591 --> 01:18:47.374
It's okay.

01:18:48.593 --> 01:18:49.637
It's okay.

01:18:50.987 --> 01:18:52.423
Stanley.

01:18:52.466 --> 01:18:54.251
What are you doing?

01:18:58.472 --> 01:18:59.256
Stop.

01:19:00.213 --> 01:19:00.910
Stanley.

01:19:02.215 --> 01:19:02.999
Let go!

01:19:05.305 --> 01:19:06.089
No.

01:19:10.397 --> 01:19:11.572
Stanley, let me go.

01:19:11.616 --> 01:19:13.444
Johnny, be together.

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:20.886
Please, Johnny.

01:19:23.802 --> 01:19:25.761
Tell me where Johnny is.

01:19:26.631 --> 01:19:28.894
- With all the other dolls.

01:19:36.859 --> 01:19:37.773
- Oh my god.

01:19:37.816 --> 01:19:39.252
Oh my god, Johnny.

01:19:39.296 --> 01:19:41.820
I'm coming, oh my god.

01:19:41.864 --> 01:19:43.387
It's okay, it's okay, come here.

01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:44.605
Come here, sit up.

01:19:44.649 --> 01:19:46.303
Give me your legs,
give me your legs.

01:19:46.346 --> 01:19:47.173
You stand up.

01:19:47.217 --> 01:19:48.392
Good boy.

01:19:48.435 --> 01:19:49.175
Good job.

01:19:49.219 --> 01:19:50.220
Give me these hands.

01:19:50.263 --> 01:19:52.396
- Run from her, Mommy, run.

01:19:52.439 --> 01:19:53.919
- Okay, baby, no.

01:19:53.963 --> 01:19:54.877
Everything's fine.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.921
Johnny.

01:19:55.965 --> 01:19:56.748
- Run from her.

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:57.967
- Don't be scared.

01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:59.185
That's how she gets
you, when you're scared.

01:19:59.229 --> 01:20:00.708
I need you to be strong.

01:20:00.752 --> 01:20:03.581
- I want you to be afraid
so we can be together.

01:20:03.624 --> 01:20:05.191
- But we gotta get out
of here, baby, okay?

01:20:05.235 --> 01:20:07.890
- She's already here, Mama,
waiting for us to be together.

01:20:07.933 --> 01:20:09.630
- Johnny, no.

01:20:09.674 --> 01:20:11.197
No.

01:20:11.241 --> 01:20:12.720
- She's already in here,
waiting for us to be together.

01:20:12.764 --> 01:20:15.898
- No, goddamn it,
Johnny, stay behind me.

01:20:15.941 --> 01:20:16.768
Come on.

01:20:18.335 --> 01:20:19.336
Goddamn it, no!

01:20:19.379 --> 01:20:20.859
- Are you gonna leave me here?

01:20:20.903 --> 01:20:22.687
With our son?

01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:23.514
- Stanley.

01:20:24.645 --> 01:20:25.690
- I thought we were family.

01:20:25.733 --> 01:20:27.823
We're all staying here forever!

01:20:27.866 --> 01:20:28.649
- Johnny.

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.961
- Get out of here while we can.

01:20:50.062 --> 01:20:51.411
Hurry.

01:20:51.455 --> 01:20:53.674
Go ahead and open the
passenger door, okay?

01:20:53.718 --> 01:20:56.460
- Yeah.

01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:20.963
- We're lucky we escaped.

01:21:21.006 --> 01:21:22.747
It's possessed.

01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:23.922
There's no telling what
he would have done to us

01:21:23.966 --> 01:21:25.576
in his demented state.

01:21:25.619 --> 01:21:27.708
Just glad I got there when
I did to save you both.

01:21:27.752 --> 01:21:29.928
Thank god I'm always there
to pick up the pieces.

01:21:29.972 --> 01:21:32.888
People just don't understand
how important it is

01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:34.715
to be there when it matters.

01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:38.328
Sorry about the
chemicals, Jennifer,

01:21:38.371 --> 01:21:41.070
but you as a physicist can
appreciate what they do

01:21:41.113 --> 01:21:43.637
to the brain and the
central nervous system.

01:21:43.681 --> 01:21:44.725
Lot of stress, so.

01:21:44.769 --> 01:21:46.814
This special local bourbon.

01:21:46.858 --> 01:21:50.775
Would you put this
on for me, please?

01:21:50.818 --> 01:21:53.212
Add in your run of the
mill muscle relaxer

01:21:53.256 --> 01:21:55.519
and you know.

01:21:55.562 --> 01:21:58.087
Stanley should spend
more time with Johnny,

01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:59.653
be more of a father figure.

01:21:59.697 --> 01:22:01.177
Doesn't even matter

01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:02.830
whether or not he's the
biological father or not.

01:22:03.657 --> 01:22:08.662
- Mom.

01:22:19.325 --> 01:22:21.023
- Alright, come on, let's go.

01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:22.720
Come on, that's right.

01:22:22.763 --> 01:22:24.417
Come on, Johnny.

01:22:24.461 --> 01:22:26.724
Good boy, that's it.

01:22:26.767 --> 01:22:28.117
Come, come, come, come.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.857
Yeah, you got it.

01:22:29.901 --> 01:22:30.946
Let's go.

01:22:35.124 --> 01:22:36.690
Come, come, come.

01:22:36.734 --> 01:22:37.517
Yes.

01:22:38.779 --> 01:22:40.738
We're all gonna live
happily ever after

01:22:40.781 --> 01:22:42.958
together in this house
for all eternity.

01:22:45.612 --> 01:22:46.918
- No, no, no, no.

01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:49.268
No, we will not!

01:22:49.312 --> 01:22:51.096
Johnny, Johnny, come on.

01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:52.793
Baby, we have to run.

01:22:52.837 --> 01:22:54.404
Johnny, come with me, baby.

01:22:54.447 --> 01:22:55.361
Baby, come with me.

01:22:55.405 --> 01:22:56.884
- Mommy, I want to stay here.

01:23:01.019 --> 01:23:03.500
- I'm coming
back with the police!

01:23:03.543 --> 01:23:05.632
- They're never gonna
believe you, Jennifer.

01:23:05.676 --> 01:23:09.027
- Mom, I need you to
stay here forever,

01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:10.376
with all my friends.

01:23:11.203 --> 01:23:12.204
- Not your friends.

01:23:12.248 --> 01:23:14.163
- Oh well, let's
go see your dad.

01:23:15.381 --> 01:23:17.035
- They're
not real, Johnny!

01:23:19.298 --> 01:23:24.303
I'm coming back.

01:23:47.457 --> 01:23:48.893
- Go to your father.

01:23:59.034 --> 01:23:59.860
- Hello, Daddy.

01:24:31.892 --> 01:24:33.851
- Ma'am, where are they?

01:24:33.894 --> 01:24:34.939
- Okay.

01:24:34.982 --> 01:24:36.506
They're upstairs in the study.

01:24:40.423 --> 01:24:42.903
- There.

01:24:42.947 --> 01:24:44.340
- Johnny?

01:24:44.383 --> 01:24:45.167
Johnny?

01:24:54.001 --> 01:24:56.221
- Mommy.

01:24:56.265 --> 01:24:57.396
Mommy.

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:00.095
Mommy.

01:25:10.192 --> 01:25:12.063
Come with us, Mommy.

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:13.630
- God.

01:25:14.935 --> 01:25:17.112
- Don't leave us.

01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:21.377
Mommy.

01:25:23.074 --> 01:25:23.857
Come with us.

01:25:48.621 --> 01:25:49.492
- Hey there.

01:25:50.797 --> 01:25:51.755
- Are you the owner?

01:25:51.798 --> 01:25:53.322
- No, my name's Johannes.

01:25:53.365 --> 01:25:54.192
Or Johann.

01:25:54.236 --> 01:25:55.411
Friends call me Joe.

01:25:55.454 --> 01:25:57.064
Go right in and
take a look around.

01:25:57.108 --> 01:25:58.805
This is a special place.

01:25:58.849 --> 01:26:01.808
But don't forget, you buy
the house, you buy me too.

01:26:01.852 --> 01:26:02.940
Because I'll be here.
