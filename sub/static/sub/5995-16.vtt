Previously on
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...
Oh-oh!

00:03.504 --> 00:05.439
Whatever happened
with you and your ex?

00:05.473 --> 00:06.507
Ex?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.213
Oh, Greg, I'm sorry.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.516
Do you love her?
No.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.451
You forgive me?

00:17.485 --> 00:19.353
Of course, I forgive you, Joshy.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.256
Love doesn't work out
for me, ever.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.225
DR. AKOPIAN:
 So you are unhappy.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.327
Yeah. Duh.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.130
DR. AKOPIAN:
 Maybe it's time you see
 what else is in your life,

00:29.163 --> 00:31.132
besides Josh Chan.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.700
Oh, my gosh,
you have changed my life,

00:32.732 --> 00:35.136
Dr. Dream Ghost Akopian.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.370
You made me see past

00:36.404 --> 00:38.706
all of my delusions
that were holding me back.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.374
Josh, you don't understand?

00:40.408 --> 00:42.276
You don't see what this has

00:42.310 --> 00:44.412
all been about for Rebecca?

00:44.445 --> 00:45.546
JOSH:
 Rebecca,

00:46.414 --> 00:48.516
are you in love with me?

00:50.518 --> 00:53.287
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

00:53.321 --> 00:55.089
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

00:55.123 --> 00:56.390
* One day I was crying a lot

00:56.424 --> 00:57.625
* And so I decided to move

00:57.658 --> 00:59.460
* To West Covina, California

00:59.493 --> 01:00.628
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

01:00.661 --> 01:02.863
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

01:02.896 --> 01:05.465
* But that's not why I'm here

01:05.498 --> 01:07.568
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.437
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

01:09.470 --> 01:10.438
That's a sexist term.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.140
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

01:12.173 --> 01:13.407
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

01:13.441 --> 01:15.676
* She's so broken inside *

01:15.709 --> 01:17.345
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.347
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

01:19.380 --> 01:20.648
Okay! We get it!

01:20.681 --> 01:23.083
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

01:27.388 --> 01:29.357
Why do you have
all these photos?

01:29.390 --> 01:32.193
Yep, okay,
so here's what happened.

01:32.226 --> 01:36.697
I had... have...

01:36.730 --> 01:39.533
...had feelings for you,
indeed, yes.

01:39.567 --> 01:43.437
God, this is awkward, um,

01:43.471 --> 01:46.240
I came here to tell you
that Valencia...

01:46.274 --> 01:47.541
Valencia and you
are staying together.

01:47.575 --> 01:48.342
No-- I-I-I I gathered.
Yeah.

01:48.376 --> 01:49.910
I get it and that
makes sense, yeah.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.846
Josh, I'm actually
very glad you're here,

01:52.880 --> 01:56.550
because, um, I realized
some things on my recent trip.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.386
And, um, one of
the things I realized

01:58.419 --> 01:59.920
is that I need
to break my old patterns.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.689
Okay.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.491
Yes, uh, starting with...

02:03.524 --> 02:08.562
(sighs) I've been horrible to
Valencia, like, really horrible,

02:08.596 --> 02:11.199
and I really want
to reach out to her.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.434
I really wouldn't.
I really
think I should.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.504
She really hates your guts.
Understandable,

02:16.537 --> 02:19.440
and I will just
have to transcend that.

02:21.575 --> 02:26.280
I am trying to break free of
anything unhealthy or damaging.

02:27.681 --> 02:31.385
So, um, that starts with,
uh, trashing these.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.354
Unless you want them.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.956
(both laugh)
No, no, that's okay.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.558
Yeah.
Yeah.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.594
Although, um, you know,
some of those are great angles

02:40.628 --> 02:43.464
that you can't get with
a selfie, so, uh...

02:43.497 --> 02:45.433
Sure, yeah, yes.
Yeah.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.567
Thanks.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.868
Okay, well, there it is.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.470
That's the last
of the Josh Chan stuff.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.339
There was stuff?

02:51.372 --> 02:52.540
No.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.744
Well, I guess I should go.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.479
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course, get out.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.649
Get out of here.
(laughs)
Yeah, yeah.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.684
Bye, Josh.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.660
(sighing)

03:22.002 --> 03:23.671
Can I get another beer?
I'm trying to study.

03:23.704 --> 03:27.675
Studying and drinking
at the same time: good decision.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.277
I know, right?

03:29.310 --> 03:31.679
It's easy.
It's extension school.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.282
I-I don't like to tell
a lot of people this,

03:34.315 --> 03:36.016
but I got into
Emory business school.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.518
It's a pretty good school.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.553
They call it like
the Harvard of the South.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.522
I thought the Harvard
of the South was Vanderbilt.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.958
No. No. No.

03:44.992 --> 03:49.697
Yeah, so I got into school,
and then my dad got sick,

03:49.730 --> 03:52.466
so now I'm working my way
through school here.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.668
You know? I can't be slinging

03:54.702 --> 03:57.971
drinks to losers until
I'm like 60 years old.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.808
(scoffs)

04:02.776 --> 04:06.680
Oh, boy, look at this.
Just what I need.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.552
Hi.
Hey.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.621
I thought you drank
at Home Base.

04:13.654 --> 04:18.625
I drink anywhere,
but I do my study-drinking here.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.726
Got it.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.961
Can I pull up a
stool next to you,

04:20.994 --> 04:22.563
or do you want to be alone?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.565
I could go home and
drink some mouthwash.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.766
Mouthwash, wow.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.635
That's almost as sad
as a girl coming to

04:27.668 --> 04:29.637
a strange bar by herself.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.606
Sad says the man
with an open textbook

04:32.640 --> 04:34.975
next to an open container.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.877
This is fun. I like this.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.513
Do you want to hang out for
a while and insult each other?

04:39.547 --> 04:41.615
Ah, what would your girlfriend
think about that?

04:41.649 --> 04:44.685
Um, Heather?
Uh, yeah, no, we're donezo.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.719
(blows raspberry)

04:45.753 --> 04:47.755
Oh, wow. I had no idea.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.590
Can I get you a drink?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.759
Nothing goes better with a
fine lager than a little snark.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.461
Wait. Go back to
the Heather thing.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.828
Are you okay?
Let's-let-let's talk.

04:54.862 --> 04:58.532
Talk is not on the bar menu,

04:58.566 --> 04:59.633
but we could ask.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.769
Okay, so, yeah,
here's the thing.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.438
Old me would have
been totally down

05:04.472 --> 05:06.707
for, like, an
old-fashioned barb fest,

05:06.740 --> 05:08.342
but I've decided recently

05:08.376 --> 05:10.744
that I'm trying to
change my patterns.

05:12.112 --> 05:15.082
So I'm gonna go.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.017
No, come on. Come on.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.419
I'm a glutton for punishment.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.620
Stay.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.654
Let's do this.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.089
We can make bad
decisions together.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.692
We could run in traffic.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.028
No? Okay.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.731
Boy, she really digs you.

05:30.764 --> 05:31.999
She's in love with someone else,

05:32.032 --> 05:34.668
but I figure ten, 11 years
of me trying,

05:34.702 --> 05:35.969
I'm a lock.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.878
Okay, what is happening?

05:44.912 --> 05:46.747
Why are you throwing out
all this Josh stuff?

05:46.780 --> 05:48.616
I told you, I've gone
cold turkey on the Chan.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.485
I'm done. It's not good for me,
and you know that.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.422
D-- oh, G-- you have
to keep the macaroni portrait.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.723
That took two weeks.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.758
No, no, Paula, I'm breaking
my old patterns.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.760
Break old pat-- I--
what does that even mean?

05:59.793 --> 06:01.695
Did you go to a
bumper sticker store?

06:01.729 --> 06:04.798
No, I just realized a lot of
things on my trip to New York,

06:04.832 --> 06:07.167
while I was in a
bumper sticker store.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.136
Okay, but you're right
about this, actually,

06:09.169 --> 06:10.938
it has a lot of dry goods on it,

06:10.971 --> 06:12.139
it actually could be useful
for my earthquake kit,

06:12.172 --> 06:13.707
so I will keep this.
That's my girl.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.476
But everything else
goes in the trash.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.711
Hmm, hmm.
Oh, come on.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.848
(gasps)
Not Channy bear. I forbid it.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.117
Fine, maybe I'll just
put Channy bear

06:24.151 --> 06:27.988
on a high shelf in case
of a bearmergency.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.724
But the rest of
this is going, bye.

06:30.758 --> 06:31.725
Oh, come on...
Bye, letters to Josh.

06:31.759 --> 06:32.960
First drafts,
second drafts.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.161
In the trash.
No.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.429
Yep.
That's...

06:35.463 --> 06:36.864
That's insanity.
Nope. Nope.

06:36.897 --> 06:37.731
Good-bye, Josh thong

06:37.765 --> 06:38.999
that I never wo--
I don't wear thongs.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.033
Why did I even get this?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.869
You have finally lost it.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.837
You have left the reservation
and I-I can't... I'm not...

06:43.871 --> 06:45.005
I can't watch it.
I don't care.
I don't care.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.874
I'm not supporting this.
No, uh-uh.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.723
Hey... I'm so nervous,
aren't you?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.625
That last test...
(groans)

07:04.658 --> 07:06.694
Was pretty easy,
at least for me.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.629
Wow, that's impressive.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.163
You must be smart.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.865
Yeah, well.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.468
I-I don't like to tell
people this, but, um...

07:14.502 --> 07:16.504
Oh, you don't have to tell me
something you don't like to...

07:16.537 --> 07:18.105
I got into the
Harvard of the South.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.774
Emory? You know it?

07:20.808 --> 07:21.809
Emory?

07:21.842 --> 07:23.176
The Harvard of the South
is Duke.

07:23.210 --> 07:26.747
No. No, no.
Emory. Google it.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.816
PROFESSOR:
So, everyone,

07:28.849 --> 07:31.852
overall there were
some nice efforts,

07:31.885 --> 07:36.189
but, uh, some of you,
I'm sad to say, fell short.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.766
I'm really not sure
what rubric you're using

07:45.799 --> 07:47.801
to grade these, but...

07:47.835 --> 07:49.202
Doesn't take much
of a rubric to see

07:49.236 --> 07:50.838
that you didn't put in
much of an effort here.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.841
Oh, well, you know,
I work full-time.

07:53.874 --> 07:54.708
My dad is sick.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.545
I work two jobs
and my husband is dead.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.180
I am very sorry to hear that,

08:00.213 --> 08:02.716
but I was not involved.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.852
Your next assignment
is an essay due Friday.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.887
You can do better,
Mr. Serrano.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.022
You got into the
Harvard of the South, after all,

08:09.056 --> 08:12.626
which you somehow managed
to mention on your test.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.762
A multiple choice test.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.797
So, you're busting my balls

08:16.830 --> 08:19.199
about an intro class
at an extension school?

08:19.232 --> 08:20.968
Cool, yeah. Makes sense.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.905
Look, I don't know you very
well, but from where I stand,

08:24.938 --> 08:27.975
it seems like you've made the
choice not to try or something.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.210
Oh, please, don't you
worry about my decisions.

08:30.243 --> 08:33.847
I will decide
about my decisions.

08:38.085 --> 08:41.054
(mocking the teacher):
Choosing not to try, Greg.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.256
You got into Emory, Greg.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.092
I mean, duh,
I could have done better.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.828
I could have gotten an "A"
on that test if I'd wanted to.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.598
* Whoop-de-frickin'-do, an "A"

08:50.631 --> 08:53.066
* What's an "A"?
It's just a letter on a page *

08:53.100 --> 08:55.235
* Meant to distract us
from the pain *

08:55.268 --> 08:58.005
* But it's not like any "A" can
make a difference in the day *

08:58.038 --> 08:59.840
* Sure, I could get an "A"
if I wanted to get an "A" *

08:59.873 --> 09:01.008
* But who cares about an "A"?

09:01.041 --> 09:02.776
* I don't

09:02.810 --> 09:04.311
* I don't care

09:04.344 --> 09:05.579
* Although I could
have made that grade *

09:05.613 --> 09:06.747
* If I did care

09:06.780 --> 09:10.217
* But I don't

09:10.250 --> 09:12.720
* But I could if I wanted to

09:12.753 --> 09:14.622
* Whoop-de-frickin'-do

09:14.655 --> 09:17.190
* Look at this guy in the red
and blue striped tie *

09:17.224 --> 09:18.926
* Making millions till he dies

09:18.959 --> 09:21.629
* Selling bonds and stocks
to other guys in ties *

09:21.662 --> 09:23.631
* Who have millions
with which to buy *

09:23.664 --> 09:24.865
* A bunch of bonds
and stocks and ties *

09:24.898 --> 09:26.166
* I'd rather die

09:26.199 --> 09:27.635
* Which I will eventually,
of course *

09:27.668 --> 09:29.336
* But in the meantime

09:29.369 --> 09:32.606
* I could make millions selling
stocks and bonds and ties *

09:32.640 --> 09:34.041
* If I tried

09:34.074 --> 09:35.375
* But I don't

09:35.408 --> 09:39.647
* But I could, but I don't

09:39.680 --> 09:43.050
* But I could if I wanted to

09:43.083 --> 09:45.719
* Yeah

09:45.753 --> 09:48.388
* Yeah, I could if I wanted to

09:48.421 --> 09:52.059
* Who cares?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.762
* Whoop-de-frickin'-do

09:54.795 --> 09:56.063
* A happy dad

09:56.096 --> 09:57.197
* With his big dad calves

09:57.230 --> 09:58.766
* And his stupid baseball cap

09:58.799 --> 09:59.967
* And his T-ball shirt

10:00.000 --> 10:02.002
* And dumb-ass son
throwing a ball *

10:02.035 --> 10:04.672
* Like it's so important
to know how to throw a ball *

10:04.705 --> 10:06.073
* Whoop-de-frickin'-do

10:06.106 --> 10:07.641
* Who cares about
throwing a ball *

10:07.675 --> 10:08.942
* Or having a kid

10:08.976 --> 10:10.277
* It'll get you
nowhere in life *

10:10.310 --> 10:12.212
* Not like getting
anywhere matters *

10:12.245 --> 10:14.982
* Although I guess it does
if you care *

10:15.015 --> 10:18.085
* Which I don't

10:18.118 --> 10:20.921
* But I could, but I don't

10:20.954 --> 10:23.390
* But I could if I wanted to

10:23.423 --> 10:26.059
* Yeah

10:26.093 --> 10:29.396
* Whoop-de-frickin'-do
if I wanted to *

10:29.429 --> 10:32.232
* This song sucks

10:32.265 --> 10:35.402
* I could make it good
if I wanted to *

10:35.435 --> 10:38.338
* Yeah

10:38.371 --> 10:41.975
* Yeah, I could
if I wanted to. *

10:45.913 --> 10:48.181
I could do that
if I wanted to.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.218
You're an idiot.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.022
(sighs)

10:55.055 --> 10:57.024
Oh, my God, this is nuts.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.859
Okay, you can't give up
on Josh right now.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.193
You are so close.

11:00.227 --> 11:03.063
Paula, he picked Valencia.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.031
Like, in front of my face.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.966
Game over.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.034
What? No.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.069
Game has just begun.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.338
Okay, you have antibodies
to his saliva.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.807
You cannot give up.
You have traction.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.809
He-he touched the side
of your boob, I saw it.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.444
(doorbell rings)

11:17.477 --> 11:20.213
Can you get whoever that...
Yeah, I will get that.

11:20.247 --> 11:23.383
And... just... let's continue
the convo later, okay?

11:23.416 --> 11:25.819
And if it's the people across
the street from that church,

11:25.853 --> 11:27.821
just tell them I don't believe
and will never believe.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.389
Rebecca.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.794
Hello, everyone
in Josh's family.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.462
Hi.
Oh, my gosh.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.832
I haven't seen you since
the last book club.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.233
(squeals)
I haven't seen you got engaged.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.835
How does it feel?

11:41.869 --> 11:43.136
It feels like I've
been waiting seven years

11:43.170 --> 11:45.438
for Phillip to propose,
because I have.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.807
(laughing)

11:46.840 --> 11:47.941
Let me see the rock.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.076
Oh, my gosh, I mean,

11:49.109 --> 11:51.078
Phillip said he was going
for it, but... (whistles)

11:51.111 --> 11:52.846
He said you were
so helpful getting it.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.014
Oh, it was no problem at all.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.315
I helped my client, Moshe,

11:55.348 --> 11:56.850
through a very complicated
subdivision deal,

11:56.884 --> 11:58.151
and he said he could hook me up

11:58.185 --> 11:59.920
with non-blood diamonds
at a discount.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.155
And never pass up
a good discount, right?

12:02.189 --> 12:04.124
I know what you're thinking--
like, diamonds, discounts,

12:04.157 --> 12:06.493
those are some like classic
Jew moves, you know?

12:08.095 --> 12:09.930
What are you doing here?

12:09.963 --> 12:12.399
Jayma has something to ask you.

12:12.432 --> 12:15.368
Look, I know that
this is sudden,

12:15.402 --> 12:18.238
and we haven't known
each other that long--

12:18.271 --> 12:20.540
God, I feel like I'm
proposing or something.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.343
You've been such
a good friend to the family.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.212
You wrote Jastenity that letter
to get into Harvard.

12:25.245 --> 12:29.149
Unfortunately the letter
was better than her application,

12:29.182 --> 12:30.918
but she did get
into Cal State Northridge,

12:30.951 --> 12:32.886
which is the
Harvard of Northridge.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.021
Yeah, it is.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.222
There we go.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.556
Anyway, what I'm
trying to say is,

12:36.589 --> 12:40.060
how would you like to be
a bridesmaid at my wedding?

12:42.229 --> 12:43.797
PAULA:
You mean,

12:43.831 --> 12:44.898
be an official part
of the Chan fam-bam?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.166
She'd love to.

12:47.234 --> 12:51.171
You want me to be
a bridesmaid.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.207
Aw, you're such a lovely girl,
Rebecca.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.543
We would be so honored
if you would

12:56.576 --> 12:58.345
become a part
of our family wedding.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.947
And you are the perfect height

12:59.980 --> 13:01.248
to pair with
Phillip's friend, Daniel,

13:01.281 --> 13:03.450
who stopped growing
after being a kid gymnast.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.987
Um, actually,

13:07.020 --> 13:09.156
I-I don't know
if I should.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.958
Oh.
PAULA: Okay, hey,
why don't we just...?

13:10.991 --> 13:13.493
O-One second, Chan ladies.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.062
Come here. One...

13:15.095 --> 13:16.496
One-one second.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.966
Okay, this would
kill Valencia.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.033
Dead. Down in the ground.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.334
Like a bug.
Legs in the air.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.870
Now she's a ghost, boo.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.204
Okay, but, Paula,
what have I been saying?

13:24.237 --> 13:27.007
I need to disengage and
disentangle from dis family.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.008
Know what I'm saying?

13:28.041 --> 13:30.477
Seriously, I-I want
to make amends to Valencia,

13:30.510 --> 13:32.312
and this is like
the opposite of that.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.214
Yeah, okay, well, who says
no to being a bridesmaid?

13:34.247 --> 13:35.382
You can't do that.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.385
I mean, who does that?
Monster people.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.021
I have a question.
No.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.189
Is Valencia a bridesmaid?

13:42.222 --> 13:44.024
Uh, not exactly.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.192
By that she means no.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.559
Like, ew, no.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.461
Here's the thing,
I-I'd love to be a bridesmaid,

13:48.495 --> 13:50.163
but I don't think
it would be fair

13:50.197 --> 13:52.232
for me to be a bridesmaid
and for Valencia not to be.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.001
I guess you're right.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.936
And Josh has asked for Valencia

13:55.969 --> 13:57.470
to be a bridesmaid
about 50 times, so...

13:57.504 --> 14:00.540
Great, so you get what
I'm trying to say.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.275
So you can both be
in the wedding.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.911
Sorry, what's that?

14:03.944 --> 14:05.245
Pardonnez-moi?

14:05.278 --> 14:07.280
You and Valencia
can both be bridesmaids.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.649
That way you don't have to worry
about her not being included.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.919
Very wise, Jayma.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.153
It's settled, then.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.188
Yeah, it is!
(all laughing)

14:24.965 --> 14:26.499
(laughing):
H-H-Hey.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.002
I know you, from Spider's.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.938
You were the sourpuss

14:30.971 --> 14:32.940
fighting with the girl
in the shiny dress.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.475
Hey, I'm, I'm not a sourpuss.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.644
I'm pensive and deep.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.046
Are you dusting potatoes?

14:39.079 --> 14:41.381
I like to look busy.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.616
Well, you're out of dark roast.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.652
I can't study
without dark roast.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.054
Could you get on that?

14:47.087 --> 14:50.590
Oh, yeah, sure,
uh, no problemo.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.159
Thanks.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.198
Hi.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.638
She's cute.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.607
Are we being pleasant now?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.576
Sorry, I don't
know your rules.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.478
So, you two an item?

15:11.511 --> 15:14.247
Me and Ally?
Oh, I wish.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.648
She quit her job

15:15.682 --> 15:18.318
as a manager at a Whole Foods,
came to work here.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.321
I could not figure out why
for the longest time.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.323
And then I realized...

15:27.094 --> 15:28.962
GREG:
Hey, I know that guy.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.999
* Grocery clerk
with half an eyelid. *

15:32.032 --> 15:35.235
His name is Brody.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.569
I can't compete with him.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.640
He has the flattop
of a Greek god.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.977
This! (both laugh)

15:44.011 --> 15:45.612
Whoa, you are so
good at magic.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.314
How do you do it?

15:47.347 --> 15:49.682
Uh-uh-uh. A true magician
never reveals his secrets.

15:49.716 --> 15:50.650
Come on, Brody.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.285
So you like her.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.520
Yeah.

15:53.553 --> 15:54.754
I don't have a shot.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.589
I mean, look at her.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.491
I should give up.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.692
I know that's the
right decision.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.728
Are you sure she
doesn't like you?

16:01.761 --> 16:03.663
Watch this.

16:03.696 --> 16:04.998
Ally.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.666
Ally.

16:06.699 --> 16:07.734
Ally, though.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.771
That's my type, too.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.073
Ally.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.075
(hisses)

16:15.108 --> 16:17.577
Oh, that's so hot.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.612
Okay, bro, I gotcha.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.148
I know exactly what
you need to do.

16:25.285 --> 16:29.789
So, you and Valencia
are friends?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.359
Uh, kinda.

16:32.392 --> 16:35.028
I'd say we share a history
of common interests.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.696
Of course, she's late.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.731
She's the kind of person that
has to make an entrance.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.800
You know what?
I don't think that's fair.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.769
I wouldn't stereotype her
as someone that...

16:42.802 --> 16:44.471
Oh, sorry I'm late.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.772
I just had some pictures taken

16:45.805 --> 16:47.674
for my Hometown Hotties
submission to Maxim.

16:47.707 --> 16:48.708
Ugh.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.812
We ready to try on some dresses?

16:52.845 --> 16:54.247
Jas, come on.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.183
Let's go pick out the
first round of dresses.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.787
(whispering):
This is beautiful.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.624
Hey.
Whoa!

17:04.656 --> 17:06.792
Hey, Valencia, hi, oh,

17:06.826 --> 17:08.395
uh, this is going to be so fun.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.463
Are you ready to be, like,
bridesmaid buddies?

17:10.497 --> 17:13.300
I want to make myself
very, very clear.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.534
Okay.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.069
I know what happened.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.637
I know about the kiss.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.539
And if it were
any other situation,

17:19.571 --> 17:21.708
I would take off my earrings,
my extensions, and my wings,

17:21.741 --> 17:23.675
and curb-stomp you.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.678
Got it, that's fair.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.079
But, for some reason,
you're the one

17:27.114 --> 17:28.381
that got me into
this wedding party.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.816
Josh told me it was all you.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.584
He did?
Yep. I mean,

17:31.618 --> 17:33.786
I don't know why you did it,
but I don't care.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.522
Just stay out of my way

17:35.555 --> 17:37.290
and don't make me
look bad to these people.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.228
Hey, Valencia,
I can do better than that.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.663
I can make you look good.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.333
Yeah, yeah, like,
by the end of this,

17:46.366 --> 17:47.700
they're going to want
to adopt you.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.671
But maybe that's not, like,
precisely what you want, but...

17:51.704 --> 17:52.705
Oh, just shut up.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.408
Okay.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.777
How about this?

17:57.810 --> 17:59.212
This seems like a style

17:59.246 --> 18:00.747
that would work
on everyone.
Well,

18:00.780 --> 18:02.249
most of us.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.451
Valencia's right.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.119
Uh, you know,
uh, two-piece,

18:06.153 --> 18:10.790
halter, mesh dress might work
well for you very lean ladies,

18:10.823 --> 18:13.793
but, yeah, not for this
festival of back fat going on.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.529
(laughing)

18:16.563 --> 18:18.298
Okay, well,

18:18.331 --> 18:19.866
what about this?

18:19.899 --> 18:21.834
Oh, my God.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.636
Those are such
beautiful nipple covers.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.538
Yeah, those would
definitely cover

18:25.572 --> 18:26.639
most of my nipples.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.608
Yeah, guys, let me remind you,

18:28.641 --> 18:30.910
I eat bagels at night--
Valencia knows.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.745
She knows all about
my night bagels-- tell 'em, V.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.314
Here's what you didn't know.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.782
For my midnight bagel,

18:35.815 --> 18:37.850
I eat it with butter,
cream cheese, and...

18:37.884 --> 18:40.287
bacon.
(all laugh)

18:40.320 --> 18:41.821
Seriously. S-R-S-L-Y.

18:41.854 --> 18:42.822
Like, true story.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.558
Okay, so why don't we

18:45.592 --> 18:47.494
try different styles
in the same color?

18:47.527 --> 18:49.496
That's a great idea.
That's so ni...

18:49.529 --> 18:50.863
You know what?
I'm gonna go out on a limb

18:50.897 --> 18:52.832
and say that's, like,
really gracious.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.402
It is, actually, a,

18:55.435 --> 18:56.636
a good idea.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.804
That's the plan.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.472
So you kids can go crazy

18:59.506 --> 19:01.941
with your halters and your
sheaths and your cutouts,

19:01.974 --> 19:05.378
and I will wear a dress fit
to upholster a chair.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.879
And I will wear it with pride.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.548
Rebecca, come on.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.417
Yeah, you're not that
disgustingly fat.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.319
Aw, thank you, Valencia.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.853
Thank you.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.888
(laughter)

19:21.861 --> 19:22.895
(startled yell)

19:22.929 --> 19:23.830
Paula.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.299
What have we said
about standing places,

19:26.333 --> 19:27.500
quietly waiting for people?

19:27.534 --> 19:29.636
I forgot.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.672
Okay, so how did it go with
Valencia at the dress shop?

19:32.705 --> 19:34.341
Did you find any weaknesses?

19:34.374 --> 19:36.676
I was thinking that we could
use your role as bridesmaid

19:36.709 --> 19:37.910
to really mess her up.

19:37.944 --> 19:41.914
My first thought was
poison oak in the dress.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.883
Rashy nips, instant classic.
Paula.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.918
What?
We're not doing
any of that.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.787
We're not.
No.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.822
We're just acting
like normal people.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.924
I'm going to be like
any other teenage

19:51.958 --> 19:53.826
ex-boyfriend's sister's
last-minute bridesmaid.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.995
Yeah, so just be cool.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.399
Understood.
I have my orders.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.637
Where can a person
buy poison oak,

20:04.671 --> 20:06.306
and what is the rashiest kind?

20:06.339 --> 20:07.707
(phone dings)

20:07.740 --> 20:09.008
FEMALE VOICE:
Richard Kind is
a 59-year-old actor,

20:09.041 --> 20:11.644
best known for his role
in Spin City.

20:11.678 --> 20:14.847
No. Poison oak, rashiest kind.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.849
(phone dings)

20:16.883 --> 20:18.985
Jim Rash is the award-winning
writer of The Descendants.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.420
Come on.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.356
You're sure this
is a good idea?

20:23.390 --> 20:24.991
Dude, she doesn't like you.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.559
She's shown no interest.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.027
She's way into someone else.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.630
Why give up now?

20:30.663 --> 20:32.832
This is the right move.

20:35.968 --> 20:39.005
Um, can I have
everyone's attention, please?

20:39.038 --> 20:40.573
Hey! Hey!

20:40.607 --> 20:42.642
Hey, someone's trying
to let it rip here.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.277
Thank you, Greg.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.478
You're welcome.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.679
(clears throat)

20:46.713 --> 20:49.015
This goes out to a young lady

20:49.048 --> 20:51.684
currently restocking
feminine products.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.853
It's called
"Clean Up on Aisle 4."

20:53.886 --> 20:57.524
Not an actual cleanup, Rick.

20:57.557 --> 21:03.296
* Clean up my heart on Aisle 4

21:03.330 --> 21:06.566
* 'Cause that's where it lays
in a heap of green olives *

21:06.599 --> 21:09.068
* From the olive bar

21:09.101 --> 21:11.838
(mouthing)
* 'Cause I'm the
pimento to your olive *

21:11.871 --> 21:16.843
* I want to be inside of you

21:16.876 --> 21:19.011
* But instead my heart
is on the floor *

21:19.045 --> 21:20.447
* Being crushed like

21:20.480 --> 21:22.715
* The garlic we sell
by the door. *

21:24.717 --> 21:26.886
(whispering):
Oh, my God,
it's working.

21:30.857 --> 21:34.827
Look out, everybody,
it's my body!

21:38.398 --> 21:39.632
(applauding)

21:40.967 --> 21:42.769
Whee! Teach me, teach me!

21:42.802 --> 21:43.903
Uh-uh, it's too hard.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.939
You didn't tell me
he was a gymnast.

21:46.973 --> 21:47.974
He can do anything.

21:54.981 --> 21:59.852
(phone chimes)

21:59.886 --> 22:02.622
Eh, can we get back to work,
or am I boring you?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.023
I am so sor...
I'm sor... it's a...

22:04.056 --> 22:05.992
it's a bridesmaid text chain.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.027
It's about... it's about
the word "cummerbund."

22:08.060 --> 22:09.496
It's... it's a funny word.

22:09.529 --> 22:10.630
Sorry. Let's get
back to the case.

22:10.663 --> 22:11.831
The case? Who cares
about the case?

22:11.864 --> 22:12.965
When are you getting
the bridesmaid gowns?

22:12.999 --> 22:14.801
'Cause I got a guy in Maine

22:14.834 --> 22:17.737
who's going to send me some
primo itchy, sticky plants.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.039
And he said he was going to
throw in a couple deer ticks

22:20.072 --> 22:21.641
for, you know, a little extra...

22:21.674 --> 22:24.711
Um, what are you talking about?

22:24.744 --> 22:26.513
Our plan: rashy nips.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.747
Oh.
I say

22:27.780 --> 22:29.716
we roll the dice for, you know,

22:29.749 --> 22:31.150
some possible Lyme disease.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.585
I have so much to say...
(phone chimes)

22:32.619 --> 22:34.086
Hold on one second.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.456
Oh, oh, it's from Jayma.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.758
It says emergency.
SOS. 411.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.460
She means 911.

22:40.493 --> 22:41.528
I wonder if Phillip
got cold feet.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.829
I have to go.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.564
What?
I have to go,
I'm sorry.

22:44.597 --> 22:45.598
What about our plan?

22:45.632 --> 22:47.467
There's no plan.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.768
Ugh.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.770
The dance we do.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.439
Hey, what's
the emergency?
I don't know, do you?

22:52.472 --> 22:53.673
Guys.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.542
There's something
I need to tell you.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.676
And it won't be easy.

22:58.110 --> 23:01.481
My dress is done early,
and I brought champagne!

23:01.514 --> 23:03.483
(all screaming)

23:03.516 --> 23:05.585
(cork pops)
(whooping)

23:06.653 --> 23:08.521
Oh, man.
Wow.

23:09.656 --> 23:10.957
ALL:
Cheers!

23:10.990 --> 23:12.559
Cheers.
Cheers.

23:12.592 --> 23:13.993
Valencia's so funny.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.862
Oh, Valencia, tell them about
the part with the old lady.

23:15.895 --> 23:19.632
Yeah, so, this 90-year-old lady
was in downward dog,

23:19.666 --> 23:22.168
and I said to her,
"Okay, just breathe into it."

23:22.201 --> 23:23.803
And she said,

23:23.836 --> 23:26.639
"If I breathe into it
any harder, I'm gonna toot."

23:26.673 --> 23:28.475
(laughing)

23:28.508 --> 23:29.809
Oh, she's so funny.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.644
She has a million
yoga stories like these.

23:31.678 --> 23:32.479
They're great.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.013
Well, I've been
practicing my humor.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.548
I watched an online tutorial.

23:35.582 --> 23:38.117
This was so much fun, you guys.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.852
When Joshy and I get married,

23:39.886 --> 23:42.589
I want all of you
to be in the wedding.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.526
Except for you.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.561
I mean, would it kill you
to say something?

23:48.595 --> 23:49.662
JASTENITY:
She's not wrong, Ruby.

23:49.696 --> 23:50.663
You're a dud.

23:52.899 --> 23:55.602
Ah, man, I am tipsy.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.805
This was so fun.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.907
Oh, Jas, we got to go meet
mom at the cake-tasting.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.775
Can you guys stay and make sure

24:02.809 --> 24:04.611
the dress gets
packed away perfectly?

24:04.644 --> 24:06.546
Like no wrinkles or bubbles.

24:06.579 --> 24:07.747
Absolutely. We're on it.

24:07.780 --> 24:08.748
Valencia and I got this.

24:08.781 --> 24:09.816
Yep, we got it.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.217
Thanks, V.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.820
You know, we all thought
you were heinous,

24:13.853 --> 24:15.622
but you're kind of okay.

24:15.655 --> 24:16.989
(laughs)

24:17.023 --> 24:19.559
All right, bye, ladies.
Bye, Jayma.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.894
Drink a glass of water.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.062
Wow.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.664
(door bell jingles)

24:24.697 --> 24:25.998
They don't think
I'm heinous anymore.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.668
Jastenity even offered
me a half stick of gum.

24:28.701 --> 24:31.738
I said no because I
bloat, but still...
Congrats.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.843
Well, I guess we should, um,

24:36.876 --> 24:39.512
get the girls to pack up
this big-ass dress.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.980
Yeah, okay.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.915
Hmm, wow.

24:42.949 --> 24:45.818
Wow, this would look even worse
on me than some of the others.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.086
Oh, come on, stop.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.589
I mean, you make jokes
about your body,

24:49.622 --> 24:51.090
and they're pretty funny
and mostly accurate,

24:51.123 --> 24:54.093
but with your big boobs,
that dress would look great.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.562
Are you kidding? No.

24:55.595 --> 24:56.696
I'd be spilling
out of this thing,

24:56.729 --> 24:58.097
and not like in a
sexy, on purpose,

24:58.130 --> 24:59.666
Christina Hendricks
type of way.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.634
So? Guys don't care.

25:01.668 --> 25:04.103
Guys love big boobs like yours.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.272
I mean, sometimes
I hate my small boobs.

25:06.305 --> 25:09.075
I mean, I thought
about getting implants.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.043
What? No, don't do that.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.012
Oh, my gosh,
Valencia, if you knew

25:13.045 --> 25:14.614
what went into having
a pair of monsters like these,

25:14.647 --> 25:15.915
you would never think
about getting them again.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.653
I'm gonna show you.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.189
(gasps)
Rebecca, you can't.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.124
Valencia,
once I put this dress on,

25:25.157 --> 25:27.960
you will never envy
these puppies again.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.729
Get ready.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.634
(groans)

25:34.667 --> 25:36.035
(gasps)

25:36.068 --> 25:37.737
Ugh.

25:37.770 --> 25:38.971
(gasps)
Mm-hmm.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.673
There... yep.

25:42.675 --> 25:43.876
* I got them heavy boobs,
heavy boobs *

25:43.910 --> 25:45.745
* Dense like dying stars,
I got them *

25:45.778 --> 25:47.680
* Heavy boobs, heavy boobs

25:47.714 --> 25:48.981
* I can't run real far

25:49.015 --> 25:52.785
* Let me break down
what I just said *

25:52.819 --> 25:54.286
* Each of my double Ds

25:54.320 --> 25:56.589
* Has the volume
of a toddler's head *

25:56.623 --> 25:57.790
* Not bitchin'
'bout my boobies *

25:57.824 --> 25:59.692
* They look super fly
in shirts *

25:59.726 --> 26:01.160
* But if I swung them
in your face *

26:01.193 --> 26:03.295
* You'd be like,
oh, my God, that hurts *

26:03.329 --> 26:05.598
* I'm blind, holy crap

26:05.632 --> 26:06.966
* I literally can't see

26:06.999 --> 26:08.835
* I have
permanent retinal damage *

26:08.868 --> 26:10.837
* I'm suing you
and your heavy boobies *

26:10.870 --> 26:13.973
* Heavy boobs, heavy boobs,
dense like dying stars *

26:14.006 --> 26:16.008
* I got them heavy boobs,
heavy boobs *

26:16.042 --> 26:18.678
* They each have
their own memoirs *

26:18.711 --> 26:20.379
* What you gotta know is that

26:20.412 --> 26:22.081
* Boobs may be where it's at

26:22.114 --> 26:23.315
* But if you cut them open

26:23.349 --> 26:24.917
* They're just sacks
of yellow fat *

26:24.951 --> 26:26.686
* Stuff falls into my bra

26:26.719 --> 26:28.621
* It's a little bit of a drag

26:28.655 --> 26:30.256
* But when I go to bed
at night *

26:30.289 --> 26:32.792
* It's like opening
a Mary Poppins bag *

26:32.825 --> 26:35.895
DANCERS:
Whee, candy and pennies!

26:37.764 --> 26:40.399
* I got them heavy boobs,
heavy boobs *

26:40.432 --> 26:42.635
* Dense like dying stars

26:42.669 --> 26:44.036
* I got them heavy boobs,
heavy boobs *

26:44.070 --> 26:46.072
* Don't need an air bag
in my car *

26:46.105 --> 26:49.041
* Here is a list
of all of the objects *

26:49.075 --> 26:53.112
* That I can hold
under my boobs *

26:53.145 --> 26:54.781
* Stapler, ten pencils

26:54.814 --> 26:56.783
* Paperback copy
of Arabian Nights *

26:56.816 --> 26:58.651
* Dog bone, remote control

26:58.685 --> 27:00.720
* Hardback copy
of Wuthering Heights *

27:00.753 --> 27:03.122
See, when a star is dying,
it transforms into a red giant.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.725
And if the red giant does not
have enough mass to fuse carbon,

27:05.758 --> 27:08.127
an inert mass of carbon and
oxygen builds up in the center,

27:08.160 --> 27:10.329
transforming into
a dense white dwarf.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.964
And yeah, like, that's my boobs.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.933
That's... that's what
my boobs are like.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.735
* I got them heavy boobs,
heavy boobs *

27:15.768 --> 27:17.036
* Dense like a white dwarf

27:17.069 --> 27:19.271
* I got them heavy boobs,
heavy boobs *

27:19.305 --> 27:20.840
* They'd be a catch
at Fisherman's Wharf *

27:20.873 --> 27:23.342
* I got them heavy boobs,
heavy boobs *

27:23.375 --> 27:25.144
* Don't ever forget that

27:25.177 --> 27:26.713
* These heavy boobs,
heavy boobs *

27:26.746 --> 27:27.780
* Are just sacks of yellow fat

27:27.814 --> 27:29.882
* Like the stuffing of a couch

27:29.916 --> 27:31.818
* They're just sacks
of yellow fat *

27:31.851 --> 27:33.853
* Technically meant
to feed a baby *

27:33.886 --> 27:35.722
* They're just sacks
of yellow fat. *

27:35.755 --> 27:37.323
Wow.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.191
I had no idea.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.861
No wonder my boobs are so small.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.195
I have no fat on my body.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.396
See?

27:44.430 --> 27:46.465
Exactly. Problem solved.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.034
Now, you try on the dress.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.135
Yes.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.336
Let's see how it looks

27:50.369 --> 27:52.404
with some nice B-cup
action in there.

27:52.438 --> 27:55.241
No. I couldn't.

27:55.274 --> 27:58.144
Wow.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.246
Oh, my.

28:00.279 --> 28:05.284
Valencia, you're going to make
a really beautiful bride.

28:05.317 --> 28:09.321
Josh is really lucky.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.923
I hope.

28:10.957 --> 28:13.860
I hope some day it is
Josh and me, I really do.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.328
It will be.

28:16.362 --> 28:21.433
And I'm so sorry if I did
anything to delay that dream.

28:21.467 --> 28:24.871
I appreciate you saying that.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.939
Do you mind taking
a picture of me?

28:26.973 --> 28:28.140
Just for me.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.508
I want to remember how I looked.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.877
Of course.

28:30.910 --> 28:31.878
Okay.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.980
Okay.

28:40.519 --> 28:43.122
Oh, I got nothing
to work with here.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.957
I mean, I've already hacked
into Valencia's e-mails

28:44.991 --> 28:45.992
and her texts.

28:46.025 --> 28:48.527
Ooh, wait a minute, what's this?

28:48.560 --> 28:49.896
A photo stream?

28:51.397 --> 28:53.966
Oh, again. You with the face.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.970
What do you mean, how did I get
Valencia's password?

28:58.004 --> 28:59.105
You know me.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.940
Okay.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.209
Let's see what we've got here.

29:03.242 --> 29:07.513
Valencia's photos... chocolate
cake... fried chicken...

29:07.546 --> 29:10.883
Spaghetti with meatballs.

29:10.917 --> 29:14.253
Oh, she just likes
to look at food.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.422
Okay.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.891
Oh.

29:18.925 --> 29:21.093
Oh, wait a minute, what is this?

29:21.127 --> 29:23.896
(gasps)
I think that's
Jayma's wedding gown.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.965
Oh!

29:25.998 --> 29:28.801
You know, I've...

29:28.835 --> 29:30.136
I've prayed to God
my whole life,

29:30.169 --> 29:32.204
and I, and I never knew
if she was listening,

29:32.238 --> 29:34.040
but...
(sighs)

29:34.073 --> 29:35.942
thank you, Big Mama.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.878
(laughs)

29:38.911 --> 29:40.412
Uh, no wrinkles.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.581
Yeah, or bubbles.
Thank you.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.950
(phone chimes)

29:43.983 --> 29:45.051
We got this.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.053
It says I have a new
like on a photo.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.255
I-I didn't take a photo,
what is this?
Hmm.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.592
(both gasp)
(door bell jingles)

29:53.625 --> 29:55.261
Hey!

29:55.294 --> 29:57.596
You ruined my wedding.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.831
Yeah, bitch.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.906
How could you?
What's wrong with you?

30:06.939 --> 30:08.107
#HotterThanTheBride?

30:08.140 --> 30:10.142
I-I-I didn't do anything.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.911
I didn't post a photo.

30:11.944 --> 30:14.013
And my hashtags
are always positive.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.414
Like, #GirlBoss

30:15.447 --> 30:16.983
or #Fitspo.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.585
Someone must be
framing me or something.

30:19.618 --> 30:20.953
What kind of psycho
with no life

30:20.987 --> 30:22.088
would do such a thing?

30:22.121 --> 30:23.890
Oh, God, Paula.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.257
You must have done it.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.893
When I went to the bathroom.

30:28.094 --> 30:29.528
This is why women

30:29.561 --> 30:30.963
don't go to the bathroom alone.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.303
Excuse me, miss, I have
a bone to pick with you.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.504
I'm sorry, sir.

30:38.537 --> 30:39.906
Can I help you?

30:39.939 --> 30:41.941
Yes, you can.
By helping yourself.

30:41.974 --> 30:45.111
Stop chasing after the
cartwheeling magician idiot boy,

30:45.144 --> 30:47.613
and start paying
attention to the guy

30:47.646 --> 30:49.115
with the bountiful,
beautiful hair,

30:49.148 --> 30:51.450
who happens to
really care about you.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.920
(laughing):
Oh, you're friends with Marty.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.054
I prefer mentor.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.122
Ah, well, I've already told him

30:56.155 --> 30:57.924
I'm not interested.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.927
Him continuing to chase after me
is a terrible decision,

31:00.960 --> 31:03.195
which makes me respect
him even less.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.231
I mean, maybe if he backed off

31:05.264 --> 31:06.999
and let me come to him,

31:07.033 --> 31:09.101
maybe I would think about it.

31:09.135 --> 31:10.536
Otherwise,
can you tell him to stop

31:10.569 --> 31:13.639
with the songs and the texts
and the skywriting?

31:13.672 --> 31:15.041
Okay.

31:17.143 --> 31:19.411
What did you skywrite?

31:19.445 --> 31:20.646
Lyrics to the song.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.148
Cost a fortune.

31:22.181 --> 31:23.115
Oh, and it was so windy.

31:23.149 --> 31:27.553
I basically paid for a cloud.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.121
So what's next, coach?

31:29.155 --> 31:30.389
What do I do?

31:30.422 --> 31:31.623
What's my next move?

31:31.657 --> 31:33.559
I don't know.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.962
I kind of think we do nothing.

31:35.995 --> 31:37.596
I like that.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.098
Like for a day?
We slow-playing?

31:39.131 --> 31:42.068
No.

31:43.202 --> 31:46.272
I actually think forever.

31:46.305 --> 31:50.009
I think we got
to call this one.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.277
Go back to dusting potatoes.

31:51.310 --> 31:55.314
You laugh, but who likes
a dusty potato?

31:55.347 --> 31:57.016
Marty, Ally's right.

31:57.049 --> 32:01.320
Chasing someone who isn't
into you is a terrible move.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.355
Trust me, I feel you.

32:03.389 --> 32:04.556
I've been there.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.126
You mean you and Rebecca Bunch.

32:08.694 --> 32:11.530
Your friends come in here
all the time talking about it.

32:11.563 --> 32:14.166
God, I hate my friends.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.401
Yeah, Marty, that's right.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.037
I did that with Rebecca.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.106
But watching you do it,

32:20.139 --> 32:23.409
I see what a bad call it was.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.743
Actually, I'm realizing,

32:24.776 --> 32:27.713
I make a lot of bad
calls in everything.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.215
Yeah, me, too.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.717
And I think we're the same.

32:31.750 --> 32:36.055
I mean, I work here
in a grocery store,

32:36.088 --> 32:38.090
even though I went
to Harvard.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.992
The Harvard of what?

32:40.026 --> 32:41.293
Just Harvard.
In Boston.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.594
Wow, yeah, God.

32:42.628 --> 32:45.297
Your decisions are
just the worst.

32:45.331 --> 32:48.067
Look, I already deleted it,
so don't worry.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.237
And we only got one like
and it was from...

32:51.270 --> 32:53.205
OMG, it's from
 Maxim's Hometown Hotties.

32:54.273 --> 32:56.242
Sorry. I'm telling you,

32:56.275 --> 32:58.444
it was Rebecca.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.279
She's been Single White Femaling
me since she got here.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.413
Valencia...

33:01.447 --> 33:02.648
You take one step closer,

33:02.681 --> 33:03.715
and I'm getting
a restraining order,

33:03.749 --> 33:04.783
Jennifer Jason Leigh.

33:04.816 --> 33:08.687
What I was going to say
was, um...

33:08.720 --> 33:10.556
You were right.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.058
Yep, it was me.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.492
(gasps)
Yeah.

33:13.525 --> 33:16.395
It was my idea for Valencia
to put on the wedding dress,

33:16.428 --> 33:20.566
and then when I saw her in it,
I-I got jealous.

33:20.599 --> 33:24.470
And so I, uh, I stole her phone
and I posted the picture.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.471
I'm sorry.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.705
I don't believe you.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.507
Only someone crazy
and sad would do that.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.741
Um, yeah,

33:29.775 --> 33:33.512
and I'm both those things,

33:33.545 --> 33:37.216
so I'm, um, I'm sorry.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.251
Valencia,

33:39.285 --> 33:41.753
I'm sorry we accused you.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.555
Rebecca, you should go.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.391
Yep.

33:49.261 --> 33:52.030
Good-bye, Chans.

33:53.832 --> 33:56.034
(women murmuring)

34:00.839 --> 34:02.174
(door opens, bell jingles)

34:11.283 --> 34:12.551
Before you start,

34:12.583 --> 34:14.620
you don't have to buy me
champagne or a fur coat;

34:14.652 --> 34:16.322
just a simple thank you
will suffice.

34:16.355 --> 34:17.389
Paula.

34:17.422 --> 34:18.757
Valencia's password was so easy.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.092
Valencia1.

34:21.127 --> 34:22.460
I mean, come on.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.630
Paula!

34:27.632 --> 34:31.370
Just get in my office.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.612
I told you not to do anything.

34:40.646 --> 34:42.148
Wait, what?

34:42.181 --> 34:43.449
I mean, why didn't
you listen to me?

34:43.482 --> 34:46.152
Oh, my God, why didn't
I listen to you?

34:46.185 --> 34:47.518
Because if I listen to you,

34:47.553 --> 34:48.487
nothing would
ever happen with Josh.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.789
No Thanksgiving, no camp.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.458
No kiss.

34:52.491 --> 34:53.891
You, you didn't do
all that by yourself.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.496
And every time you said,
"No, Paula, don't do anything."

34:57.529 --> 35:00.366
And then I did anyway,
and you were happy.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.637
Wow, yeah, you're right.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.908
Okay, that's the way
it used to be,

35:09.941 --> 35:11.577
but it's not like
that anymore, okay?

35:11.610 --> 35:12.811
No.

35:12.844 --> 35:14.513
Paula, listen to me.

35:14.546 --> 35:15.747
I'm done with Josh.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.549
Oh, come on, I saw you.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.851
You can't even throw away
the macaroni portrait.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.887
I threw it away.
Everything's gone.
Even Channy bear.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.590
Yeah. Channy bear sleeps
with the fishes.

35:26.492 --> 35:29.595
Nope. I can't give up on Josh.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.398
He's not yours to give up on.

35:32.431 --> 35:33.732
Why are you so hung up on this?

35:33.765 --> 35:35.734
It's for you.
It-It's to make you happy.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.669
No, it's not,
because I just told...

35:37.703 --> 35:38.837
It's because...

35:38.870 --> 35:41.673
if we're not chasing Josh,

35:41.707 --> 35:43.542
then you're not going to want
to hang out with me anymore.

35:43.575 --> 35:44.743
I know it.

35:44.776 --> 35:49.448
What? No. Paula, no.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.516
That's not true.

35:50.549 --> 35:51.783
Yes. Yes, it is.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.619
He's our glue.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.887
He's what holds us
together, and...

35:57.923 --> 36:00.726
I've barely seen you
this week at all.

36:00.759 --> 36:04.296
Paula, I love you.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.697
Okay, you know that.

36:05.731 --> 36:08.234
But we have to stop.

36:08.267 --> 36:11.970
It's not good for me.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.440
You and I will always be
friends, okay, I promise.

36:16.408 --> 36:18.277
But we don't need Josh Chan.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.914
Because I don't need him.

36:25.451 --> 36:26.652
Okay?

36:26.685 --> 36:28.754
Okay.

36:30.922 --> 36:33.392
Hey.

36:39.265 --> 36:41.267
(sighing)

36:46.872 --> 36:50.242
Hey, hi.

36:50.276 --> 36:53.679
I'm sorry, I, um,
I needed somewhere to drink,

36:53.712 --> 36:55.347
and I thought,
I thought you'd be at school.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.549
You're here.

36:57.583 --> 36:58.684
What'll it be?

36:58.717 --> 37:00.352
It's last call.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.587
Um,

37:01.620 --> 37:04.956
I guess, I don't know,
I'll take some alcohol.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.758
Do you know any alcohol names?

37:06.792 --> 37:08.460
Yes.

37:08.494 --> 37:11.730
I will take a peach
schnapps on the rocks?

37:11.763 --> 37:13.332
No, never mind.

37:13.365 --> 37:14.600
Never order drinks again.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.368
I'll make you something.

37:17.936 --> 37:20.439
That's a lot of
books you got there.

37:20.472 --> 37:23.775
Yeah, I'm trying this really new
radical approach to studying--

37:23.809 --> 37:25.711
it's called studying.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.648
Wow. Is it working?

37:29.681 --> 37:31.950
Really well.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.455
This is perfect.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.656
What is this?

37:37.689 --> 37:38.924
It's this really exotic drink

37:38.957 --> 37:40.692
called the gin and tonic.

37:40.726 --> 37:43.562
Well, I've never heard
of a gin and tonic before,

37:43.595 --> 37:45.797
but I think it's
gonna be really big.

37:45.831 --> 37:48.667
I'm sending in the patent.
(laughs)

37:48.700 --> 37:51.002
Hey, what are you doing
after this?

37:51.036 --> 37:53.972
Do you want to, like, I don't
know, go to another bar,

37:54.005 --> 37:58.810
get a drink, or hang out
at my place, or...

37:58.844 --> 38:00.512
What happened?

38:00.546 --> 38:01.980
Did you and Josh

38:02.013 --> 38:04.816
get in a fight--
is that what's going on?

38:04.850 --> 38:06.585
And you need
a shoulder to cry on?

38:06.618 --> 38:08.820
So you come to Greg,
'cause that's what I do.

38:08.854 --> 38:10.456
No, that's not what this is.
Rebecca,

38:10.489 --> 38:11.723
I would really love
to hang out with you,

38:11.757 --> 38:14.760
I would, but I know what
that leads to for me.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.095
And I can't.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.930
I can't be in second place
again with you.

38:20.766 --> 38:23.602
Okay, um...

38:25.371 --> 38:26.772
Great.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.640
Um, good to know.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.041
I'm... I'm gonna go.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.778
I'm gonna go.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.556
(sighs)

38:48.026 --> 38:49.995
(knocking at door)

38:50.028 --> 38:51.463
Greg?

38:56.768 --> 38:58.770
Oh, Josh, I thought you
were someone else, I...

39:04.743 --> 39:06.412
What did you do? Y-Y-You hacked
into Valencia's phone?

39:06.445 --> 39:07.879
Y-You said you were trying
to keep your distance from me,

39:07.913 --> 39:10.115
a-and then you do this?

39:10.148 --> 39:11.950
This is how you make
it up to Valencia?

39:11.983 --> 39:14.520
Okay, Josh, it's a long story,
but all that matters is:

39:14.553 --> 39:16.455
Valencia is now beloved
by your family

39:16.488 --> 39:18.490
and I'm out of the
bridal party.
Yeah, but...

39:18.524 --> 39:22.628
Josh, focus on your girlfriend
and on your family, okay?

39:24.095 --> 39:25.831
And the next time you want
to come and talk to me,

39:25.864 --> 39:28.033
don't just show up at my door.

39:28.066 --> 39:32.070
Oh... okay.

39:32.103 --> 39:35.140
Yeah, okay, cool.

39:35.173 --> 39:37.909
Um, so could you go?

39:37.943 --> 39:40.546
I-I-I have something
I need to do.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.648
Are you kicking me out?

39:44.550 --> 39:47.453
Lil' bit.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.054
Bye, Josh.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.699
(door opens and closes)

40:00.732 --> 40:04.169
I'm sorry, Channy bear.

40:14.580 --> 40:15.781
Hey, what's going on?

40:15.814 --> 40:16.948
Hi.

40:16.982 --> 40:19.050
You okay? What...

40:20.586 --> 40:21.787
No, I c... I-I can't do this.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.055
I-I can't eat a dusty potato.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.724
Oh, God, is that
what I taste like?

40:25.757 --> 40:28.059
I mean, I, I ate a,
an old French fry

40:28.093 --> 40:29.528
off the floor of my car,
but I sh...

40:29.561 --> 40:30.829
It's a metaphor.
Wa... you did what?

40:30.862 --> 40:31.930
It doesn't matter.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.199
No, good God, stop, woman.

40:34.232 --> 40:36.134
Greg, listen to me.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.537
This isn't about
anyone else but you.

40:38.570 --> 40:39.905
Okay?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.873
You're not second choice.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.775
I promise.

40:48.714 --> 40:49.915
Listen, if this
is going to happen,

40:49.948 --> 40:51.717
you need to know
something.
Okay.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.819
This isn't going to be like a
roll in the hay and you go home.

40:53.852 --> 40:55.186
This is going to be
like three days

40:55.220 --> 40:57.823
of you and me just
ruining each other.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.558
And not emotionally.

40:59.591 --> 41:00.859
Is that what you want?

41:00.892 --> 41:03.862
When do we start?

41:03.895 --> 41:06.097
*

41:19.845 --> 41:21.513
I'm so glad we're
finally doing this.

41:21.547 --> 41:22.714
Me, too.

41:22.748 --> 41:24.683
I mean, there's so many girls
I could have brought here,

41:24.716 --> 41:25.817
like a whole bunch,

41:25.851 --> 41:27.619
but I chose you, Ashley.

41:27.653 --> 41:29.788
It's Ally.
Don't care.

41:30.722 --> 41:33.659
Can we have sex now? Yay.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.026
Oh, my God.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.194
You're an idiot.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.697
And you're horrible.

41:38.730 --> 41:42.634
Why do I always make the same
mistake over and over again?

41:42.668 --> 41:44.035
I make terrible decisions.

41:44.069 --> 41:45.971
I go for the
lowest form of man

41:46.004 --> 41:47.739
because I'm afraid
to be with someone

41:47.773 --> 41:48.874
I might actually connect with.

41:48.907 --> 41:50.642
You know what?
Screw this.

41:50.676 --> 41:52.644
I'm going back
to nursing school.

41:52.678 --> 41:54.279
Wait, do you want me
to do another cartwheel?

41:54.312 --> 41:55.681
I'm-I'm-I'm good at those.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.683
Whatever.

41:57.716 --> 41:59.718
She'll be back.

41:59.751 --> 42:00.686
They always come back.

42:00.719 --> 42:01.887
