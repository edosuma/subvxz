00:13.760 --> 00:15.320
Hey, where the penguins?!

00:21.760 --> 00:22.600
Go, go.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.040
Well done, men.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.720
Prepare to enjoy warm,

00:29.720 --> 00:30.520
twisted,

00:30.520 --> 00:32.960
deliciousness.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.680
No way.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.800
That is going to my zoo report.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.080
He's onto us, boys.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.080
He saw everything.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.720
And now he's documenting it in all.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.720
In that dossier.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.520
We got us a spy.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.400
Skipper, this could be an excellent opportunity

00:53.400 --> 00:55.880
to fire up my new brain washing machine.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.160
Too soon.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.879
In the game of espionage

01:04.879 --> 01:07.920
mind manipulation and widget are the last resorts.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.200
Why don't we go to fetch the notebook?

01:10.200 --> 01:15.600
Private, don't you think I could extracted it while you're saying that sense?

01:15.600 --> 01:16.600
I suppose.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.040
I could have done it while you're saying that sense.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.720
And it only two words.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.000
And what about the ????

01:22.000 --> 01:24.200
He is a small frag, Private.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.520
We want the big fish.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.920
Fish.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.800
Exactly Rico.

01:28.800 --> 01:32.040
When there's a spy,
there's a spy master.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.640
And this little ??? is gonna lead us to there.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.120
Gentlemen, commence operation ...

01:37.920 --> 01:39.440
Eh ... where did he go?

01:39.760 --> 01:41.040
Copy that.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.160
What? No, it wasn't the name of the operation ...

01:43.160 --> 01:44.760
Skipper, he dropped this.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.680
Junior has Intel on Madagascar.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.920
How long he has been following us?

01:49.960 --> 01:51.840
Madagascar?

01:51.840 --> 01:54.480
Did somebody mention my home sweet home land?

01:54.480 --> 01:57.120
Hey, that's my royal booties scratcher.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.800
Ho ho, how I missed you.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.840
I havent ??? it won't ??? itching

02:02.840 --> 02:05.200
Even more than now than I've been itching.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.919
I do not recalls ??? itching-ness.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.520
Wait! My brain has an idea.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.720
You penguins, can go on your one of the secretly mission ...

02:15.720 --> 02:18.800
to get back my royal booties scratcher.

02:18.880 --> 02:22.400
No time ringtail, we're in the middle of real mission,

02:22.400 --> 02:25.320
With the little Mort stick in your royal ???.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.480
Oh, ???-???-???

02:28.480 --> 02:32.920
I am a penguin on the mission,
I'm better than you.

02:34.120 --> 02:39.480
But with my brain, I take three lemurs, 
also too, can have a mission.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.200
Operation: Booties, scooties, rooty-looty.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.480
Oh, it's rainy.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.280
Yes, I was going for that.

02:48.280 --> 02:49.280
Come Maurice.

02:49.280 --> 02:52.000
We're going ... we need cover.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Eh ... you mean, under cover?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.720
We shall make like those up beneath us.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.520
Wormies.

02:58.520 --> 02:59.520
Penguins.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.520
Yay!

03:00.520 --> 03:03.440
Mort, why are you 'yay'?
You are wrong.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.120
You were right, yay!

03:07.040 --> 03:09.480
Maurice, our penguiny team

03:09.480 --> 03:11.800
you will be the maniac one.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.800
Mort will be the bossy one.

03:14.800 --> 03:15.920
Yay!

03:16.400 --> 03:19.680
I mean, do this, do that.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.480
Do not tell me what to do Mort.
I am your king.

03:22.480 --> 03:25.200
And naturally, will be the cute one.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.200
Look at me.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.520
Now, where will we going to find the brand new one?

03:32.520 --> 03:35.200
Say something... sciency.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.200
Sciency?

03:36.520 --> 03:37.720
That's not even a word.

03:38.520 --> 03:42.720
Is that ... Woah, you stomped me.
We've found our genius!

03:44.240 --> 03:46.000
I got a visual, Skipper.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.320
Subject approaching sector, "salty."

03:48.320 --> 03:52.320
And he returns to the sea,
just as I expected.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.480
Hold positions.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.400
You really don't have any pretzels?

03:56.400 --> 03:59.120
This is because the penguins stole the them all,
Mrs. Trewer.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.120
Skipper, I can grab the notebook!

04:02.120 --> 04:03.200
Not yet, Private.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.320
This is just getting interesting.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.720
I'm not making this one up!

04:12.080 --> 04:15.000
Look, see, one of the penguins just flew by!

04:15.000 --> 04:17.279
Penguins don't fly, Ronald.

04:17.279 --> 04:18.880
Now, take your notebook and go write down

04:18.880 --> 04:21.720
some real observation for your trip field report.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.680
Sending him out

04:23.720 --> 04:25.520
for more recon, eh?

04:25.520 --> 04:28.800
We five can play that game.

04:31.320 --> 04:34.600
My itching is ???
while I'm standing here.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.600
Give us order bossy one.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.600
That would be you.

04:37.600 --> 04:38.800
What should I order?

04:38.800 --> 04:41.280
Pizza or Chinese,
I am easy ...

04:41.280 --> 04:45.120
Get smart one to tell us where
the heck is this building.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.720
Yo, what he said?

04:48.800 --> 04:51.520
Is the smart one suppose
works on the map or something?

04:51.520 --> 04:55.000
I think we can cover all the spy movement
if we place the camera in ...

04:55.000 --> 04:56.520
here

04:56.520 --> 04:57.520
and here.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.080
That's a pretty ambitious Kowalski.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.800
Consider it's right here!

05:01.800 --> 05:03.880
Skipper, the notebook!

05:04.720 --> 05:07.880
At the moment, Private. I am more
interested in the elephant.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.680
The conspiracy is even bigger than

05:13.680 --> 05:16.600
I imagine in my
wildest, paranoid dreams.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.000
Yep, he's told me about some of them,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
they're pretty wild.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Okay, here we go ... huh?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.200
What have you told him?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.000
Who?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.400
The spook, the snake, the spy.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.200
The who?

05:30.200 --> 05:31.100
??? you now.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.200
Rico, why don't you know left some elephant size underpants?

05:35.200 --> 05:38.000
Prepare to go ... atomic!

05:47.520 --> 05:50.000
Woo, so now you're ready to talk?

05:53.720 --> 05:55.200
Dude!

05:59.480 --> 06:02.600
Ok, maybe now it's time to get
that notebook.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.040
Does look familiar.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.600
That's because ...

06:06.600 --> 06:08.000
Bossy one ... tell maniac one

06:08.000 --> 06:11.720
that he should only speak for stupid
gibberish, and not words.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.280
What is it? Again.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.280
I think that he wants to tell us something.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.600
What is it, boy?

06:22.720 --> 06:24.800
Definitely seen that somewhere before.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.880
They're after me! They're after me!

06:33.800 --> 06:35.880
They're after me!

06:36.320 --> 06:38.560
Come on now, it's time to
go to our next stop.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.680
I've lost them.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.800
This is my report.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.480
Ho ho ho, this is a A+ material.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.720
Now, for our next challenge,
how do we get inside?

06:55.280 --> 06:59.000
Uh, how about that thing that looks like a door?
It might be a door.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.720
???, braineous, smart one!

07:17.400 --> 07:19.880
Wooo, very clever, smart one.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.000
Doing the penguins slippy slide, heh?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.920
Wee, I'm slippy!

07:31.480 --> 07:32.600
They're here.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.600
We need to retrieve that dossier, boys.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.800
This spy is wild.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.000
But we've got something he doesn't.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.400
Extension wire, glidder harness and grabby claw.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.120
I was gonna say team work.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.000
But, bring those other things too.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.680
I'm questioning your leadershippiness now.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.120
Oh, I can't take the pressure!

08:14.280 --> 08:17.080
Maniac one, vomit something useful.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.920
What do I do ... what?
I mean ... <gibberish talking>

08:20.280 --> 08:27.200
Well, you know, hook, spew, old chunky, ???, rainbow yatch, 
an old shoe.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.600
I do not care what you do.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.200
But give me something useful,
from your gut.

08:39.880 --> 08:40.600
Abort, abort!

08:45.000 --> 08:48.200
There you are, Ronald.
You can't just wonder off from the group.

08:50.200 --> 08:56.120
What do we have talk about, Ronald?
That is for observation, and not your wild, make belief story!

08:56.120 --> 09:00.360
But Ms. Trewer, these are observations.
It's those penguins from the zoo.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.000
First it's the pretzels, now they're after me!

09:03.000 --> 09:05.720
They're up and watching us right now!

09:05.720 --> 09:07.600
I think that they want to give me a widget.

09:07.800 --> 09:11.880
Ronald, do you know how stressful
this field trip is on the teacher?

09:12.320 --> 09:13.320
Very.

09:15.320 --> 09:19.120
I want it! I want it! Whatsoever!
I've got to have it.

09:20.680 --> 09:21.960
What are you doing man?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.320
If they see you, you'll
compromise our entire mission!

09:24.320 --> 09:25.800
Your mission.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.800
Let me tell you something, mister.

09:27.800 --> 09:32.120
My mission is much more important
than your mission.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.560
This itch is ever ???

09:40.480 --> 09:42.960
Pipe down, we'll get your butt scretcher.

09:48.520 --> 09:49.800
They're good.

09:55.520 --> 09:59.800
Ms. Trewer! Ms. Trewer! Look, the penguins
are right there pretending to be a totem!

10:02.200 --> 10:05.880
Honestly Ronald, stop.
Just stop.

10:05.880 --> 10:10.600
There never happened nor will ever be
any penguins in Madagascar.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.600
But the widgets!

10:13.600 --> 10:15.600
Here, stick to where you're good at!

10:15.600 --> 10:18.600
I will slay you to cutting remarks, sir.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.920
For i didn't have more important matters ...

10:21.000 --> 10:22.720
What are you doing?

10:22.720 --> 10:23.720
I am the leader!

10:23.720 --> 10:26.520
I will scratch the king's booty!

10:26.520 --> 10:27.000
But ...

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
No but!

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Except your itchy one.

10:30.520 --> 10:33.200
Ehm, yeah, regarding our mission ...

10:33.200 --> 10:34.720
Our mark has left the building!

10:34.720 --> 10:36.520
Skipper, look.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.520
Oh yes, you're the best.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.120
Oh, bossing is so nice.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.320
Penguins commandos ... ha ha ha

10:49.680 --> 10:51.480
How ridicilous ...

10:54.280 --> 10:55.480
You didn't see anything!
