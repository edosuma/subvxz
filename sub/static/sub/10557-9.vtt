00:47.798 --> 00:49.091
Item number two.

00:49.299 --> 00:52.344
Pertaining to the recent escape
from Kingston Penitentiary.

00:52.554 --> 00:55.347
There's been reports
that the fugitive, Joel Harris,

00:55.557 --> 00:58.976
has been seen in the vicinity
of Union Station.

00:59.185 --> 01:01.729
Take a good look
and keep your eyes peeled.

01:01.938 --> 01:03.523
If this character is out there,

01:03.731 --> 01:04.983
I want this station
to bring him in.

01:05.191 --> 01:06.483
Understood? Right, then.

01:06.692 --> 01:08.694
- Detective Murdoch.
- Item number three.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.572
There's been sightings
of swindlers

01:10.780 --> 01:12.156
playing a three-card monte con

01:12.364 --> 01:14.117
in the area of Shuter
and Parliament.

01:14.325 --> 01:15.075
Thank you.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.162
That's two blocks away
from our station.

01:17.370 --> 01:18.746
That, gentlemen, is...

01:21.790 --> 01:24.335
It's a bloody disgrace
is what it is.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.670
Now let's get out there
and do some real policing.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.213
None of this standing
on street corners,

01:28.423 --> 01:30.632
chatting up
bloody factory girls.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.640
So, am I a statue, then?

01:38.849 --> 01:40.977
Statue.
Yes, thank you.

01:41.186 --> 01:43.646
You walked straight past me
while I was addressing the men.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.606
- There were snickers.
- Oh.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.484
- Terribly sorry, sir.
- Yes.

01:47.692 --> 01:50.861
The sincerity of your apology
touches me deeply, Murdoch.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.031
What have you got there, anyway?

01:53.239 --> 01:55.033
They're for a device
I've conceived.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.534
Convex or concave?

01:57.743 --> 01:59.579
Parabolic, actually.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.998
They're a special design
that allows incoming rays

02:02.206 --> 02:04.167
to focus on a specific point
in space,

02:04.375 --> 02:06.251
vastly amplifying ambient light.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.462
If you say so.

02:07.670 --> 02:09.506
I intend to build
a goggle-like device

02:09.713 --> 02:11.382
that will allow me to see
in the dark.

02:11.591 --> 02:12.800
Night-vision goggles, eh?

02:13.009 --> 02:14.593
Suppose they could come in handy
one day.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.471
Sirs?

02:16.679 --> 02:17.889
There's been a murder.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.643
What have you, George?

02:21.850 --> 02:22.685
Uh, sir.

02:22.894 --> 02:25.312
The body was found here
as it lies.

02:27.231 --> 02:30.068
He was stabbed in the neck,
but there's no blood on the ground.

02:30.276 --> 02:32.444
I'm thinking he was killed
somewhere else and dragged here.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.156
Sound analysis, George.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.621
Perhaps the killer
wasn't quite finished.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.790
You there.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.709
Toronto Constabulary.

02:46.918 --> 02:48.502
Identify y--

03:23.329 --> 03:24.038
Sir!

03:24.247 --> 03:24.997
- Whoa!
- Sir!

03:29.460 --> 03:31.045
Sir!

03:37.551 --> 03:39.804
You have
a concussion, two cracked ribs,

03:40.013 --> 03:43.223
a bruised ankle, torn ligaments
in both your knee and elbow,

03:43.432 --> 03:45.310
and a gash the size
of Yonge Street

03:45.518 --> 03:47.812
running up the length
of your forearm,

03:48.021 --> 03:49.855
and you're whimpering
about a little needle.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.151
I just don't see it
as necessary is all.

03:53.359 --> 03:56.445
It's just a little mercury
to help ward off infection.

03:57.697 --> 03:59.198
Come in.

03:59.781 --> 04:00.991
Hah.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.661
Mrs. Kitchen, Mrs. Burgess.

04:03.870 --> 04:05.413
I'm just checking on
our young man.

04:05.622 --> 04:09.626
Here.
I made him his favorite dessert.

04:09.834 --> 04:12.461
Tapioca. Yum.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.006
Now, you just remember,
if you need anything,

04:15.213 --> 04:17.966
anything at all,
you just tap on my door.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.095
Oh, um, excepting
for the next hour or so,

04:21.303 --> 04:22.805
because Mrs. Burgess and I,

04:23.014 --> 04:25.141
we have a church meeting
to attend.

04:25.350 --> 04:27.100
I do hope you feel better soon.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.685
Thank you.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.819
It's not your favorite?

04:37.028 --> 04:39.906
Mrs. Kitchen is a lovely woman.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.658
But a cook she is not.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.577
Acting detective?

04:46.161 --> 04:48.831
Just until Detective Murdoch recovers,
of course.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.959
Well, you'll have to do more
than just strut around

04:51.167 --> 04:52.043
acting like a detective.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.629
Well, sir, I believe my tutelage
under Detective Murdoch

04:54.836 --> 04:56.172
has more than prepared me
for the role.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.798
I'm involved already.

04:58.007 --> 04:59.800
To bring in
an outside detective now

05:00.009 --> 05:01.843
seems like
some sort of admission

05:02.052 --> 05:04.305
that our station can't handle
its own business.

05:04.514 --> 05:05.305
Hm.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.682
Very well.

05:06.891 --> 05:08.016
But you'd better solve it.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.228
I won't disappoint you, sir.

05:11.437 --> 05:12.105
All right.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.648
I've left you with
a loose dressing on your arm.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.024
And I want you to check it
twice a day for infection.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.276
I will.

05:19.612 --> 05:20.737
Come in.

05:22.990 --> 05:23.783
Enid.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.742
Mrs. Jones.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.495
I'm sorry. I didn't know
that you had company.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.874
Where are my manners?

05:32.082 --> 05:35.545
Mrs. Enid Jones,
Dr. Julia Ogden.

05:36.129 --> 05:37.338
Pleased to meet you.

05:37.547 --> 05:39.090
Likewise.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.680
Well, I should go.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.766
Do keep an eye on that wound.

05:48.975 --> 05:50.058
Yes, I will.
Thank you.

05:54.439 --> 05:58.067
Oh, William.

05:58.651 --> 05:59.694
Look at you.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.863
Oh, I'm quite all right.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.536
So, it's the old bloody tin, then,
is it?

06:09.745 --> 06:10.620
Tin, sir?

06:10.829 --> 06:11.706
Tin flute -- suit.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.416
Oh. Yes. Well, it seemed
only appropriate.

06:14.625 --> 06:17.545
A detective can't go about
dressed as a constable.

06:17.754 --> 06:18.963
No, I suppose not.

06:19.547 --> 06:22.675
So, what's your plan, then,
Detective Crabtree?

06:22.884 --> 06:25.677
I'm off to the morgue to get
the results of the postmortem.

06:25.887 --> 06:28.389
Right.
Off you go, then.

06:29.766 --> 06:34.228
Sir, I'm wondering,
in the interest of efficiency,

06:34.437 --> 06:38.231
if I shouldn't have
my own protégé.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.067
Someone to assist
in the investigation.

06:40.276 --> 06:41.651
Protégé?

06:42.235 --> 06:44.237
Young Higgins has shown
some initiative.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.865
Young Higgins it is, then.

06:46.074 --> 06:47.449
Thank you, sir.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.534
Crabtree.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.790
The victim died
as a result of blood loss,

06:54.999 --> 06:57.209
which you've probably surmised.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.795
It doesn't look like much,
I'll admit,

06:59.002 --> 07:02.130
but it sliced the jugular vein,
and that was pretty much that.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.300
There's also a scratch
on his cheek.

07:04.509 --> 07:05.968
Suggesting a struggle, perhaps?

07:06.552 --> 07:08.553
Let's take a look
at the stomach contents, shall we?

07:09.596 --> 07:10.723
Oh, good.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.358
Hmm.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.819
Shallots.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.363
French cuisine, I believe.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.406
Perhaps he ate
in a French restaurant,

07:28.615 --> 07:30.158
um, before he was killed.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.704
Mm. I'd look for one
that serves finger food.

07:33.913 --> 07:35.038
Oh, like hors d'oeuvres
and such?

07:35.247 --> 07:36.957
No.
I mean finger food.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.292
Oh, my.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.543
It appears to have been preserved.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.632
I wonder.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.886
Yes.

07:49.095 --> 07:51.139
I noticed that his finger
was missing.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.014
Now the question would be...

07:53.223 --> 07:55.976
What was it doing
in his stomach?

08:07.028 --> 08:09.531
Better you than me, mouse.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.077
We have reason to believe
that the victim dined

08:14.286 --> 08:16.913
at a French restaurant
shortly before he was killed.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.292
French?
Didn't even know we had those.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.543
Well, we do now.
Several, apparently.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.045
Higgins has the addresses
over here.

08:23.254 --> 08:25.173
I don't really like them
that much.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.423
French restaurants?

08:26.632 --> 08:27.675
No, the French.

08:27.884 --> 08:29.218
I've got three addresses here, sir.

08:29.427 --> 08:30.802
Excellent, Henry.
Read them out.

08:31.012 --> 08:34.389
La Bonne Nuit
at 29 Wilton Street.

08:34.599 --> 08:37.475
Chez Pierre at 99 Albert.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.811
As well as Le Petit at --

08:39.019 --> 08:40.562
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.565
Is it not obvious?

08:42.773 --> 08:45.484
Here's Chez Pierre,
and here's where you found the body.

08:46.110 --> 08:49.447
And you call yourself
bloody Murdoch.

09:16.349 --> 09:18.934
William! Stop!

09:42.667 --> 09:45.461
Shh!
Listen.

10:08.234 --> 10:10.068
Mrs. Kitchen?

10:11.528 --> 10:13.364
Mrs. Kitchen?

10:13.572 --> 10:15.323
I heard a noise.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.118
Are you all right?

10:24.041 --> 10:25.750
Mr. Murdoch.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.336
Mrs. Burgess.

10:27.544 --> 10:28.586
What are you doing?

10:28.796 --> 10:30.130
Where is Mrs. Kitchen?

10:30.338 --> 10:31.548
She left.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.634
Where did she go?

10:33.842 --> 10:36.386
It's her sister.
She's in a bad way.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.681
What's wrong with her?

10:38.889 --> 10:40.182
Typhus.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.475
The doctors say
she won't last the weekend.

10:42.684 --> 10:45.312
Oh.
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.897
I'm going to take responsibility

10:47.105 --> 10:50.317
for everything here
until she returns.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.943
Is there anything
I can get for you?

10:52.610 --> 10:53.946
No. No.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.448
I-I heard thumping sounds.

10:57.158 --> 10:59.451
That would have been the porters
with her luggage.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.288
I see.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.708
If there's anything you need,
just shout.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.298
Perhaps he was like a --
like an irate customer, you know?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.174
Took things too far.

11:15.426 --> 11:17.219
You know what?
It could have been a gang killing.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.721
I've heard of them happening
in restaurants.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.514
Well, let's not be speculative, Henry.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.390
We're not even sure
that the murder took place

11:22.600 --> 11:24.184
in the restaurant.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.104
Now, the body was found here.

11:27.312 --> 11:30.106
The restaurant is right there.

11:38.908 --> 11:40.618
You go. You go now.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.327
- There's someone in there.
- Sounds mad, too.

11:42.536 --> 11:43.245
Hello!

11:43.453 --> 11:45.789
You go!
You get out of here!

11:45.998 --> 11:47.625
Did he just tell us to scram?

11:47.832 --> 11:49.418
Cheeky bugger.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.548
Hello?

11:55.758 --> 11:58.259
Show yourself.
This is the police.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.304
They may be trying to sneak out
the front.

12:01.514 --> 12:03.182
Higgins, wait.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.772
It's blood.

12:10.688 --> 12:15.318
Henry... I believe
we've found our crime scene.

12:15.528 --> 12:16.821
Bonjour.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.124
Welcome to Chez Pierre.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.509
Polly want a cracker?
Polly...

12:38.716 --> 12:39.802
It's no good.
Now he won't talk.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.346
Try speaking to him in French.
You know French.

12:42.554 --> 12:43.471
Uh, Polly...

12:43.681 --> 12:45.432
uh, voulez-vous un...

12:45.640 --> 12:47.600
um...

12:47.809 --> 12:48.644
cracker?

12:48.852 --> 12:50.437
Do you even have a cracker?

12:50.645 --> 12:52.398
I've got a biscuit.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.113
You call this vomit quiche?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.115
Bloody cheek.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.826
Bloody hell, a parrot.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.244
Tu es un cochon.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.413
Tu es un cochon.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.998
- Tu es un cochon.
- What did he say?

13:09.206 --> 13:11.792
I believe he just called you
a pig, sir.

13:12.668 --> 13:13.793
He what?

13:14.003 --> 13:16.672
"Cochon" is French for "pig."

13:16.880 --> 13:18.883
You go.
You get out of here.

13:19.091 --> 13:20.634
Cochon. Cochon.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.845
I spit at you.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.513
He doesn't seem to think
much of you at all, sir.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.307
Yes.
Well, the feeling's mutual.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.850
What's he doing here, anyway?

13:28.433 --> 13:30.686
Well, it seems he was abandoned
at the crime scene.

13:30.894 --> 13:31.812
We had no choice.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.188
Well, you've got one now, Crabtree.

13:33.397 --> 13:34.565
I want him out of here.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.070
Henry, put him in my office.

13:47.036 --> 13:49.120
Did you find anything
besides a cheeky bloody bird?

13:49.330 --> 13:50.498
Uh, well, sir,
it seems the victim

13:50.706 --> 13:51.999
was the proprietor
of Chez Pierre.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.835
An acquaintance is coming by the morgue
to identify the body.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.003
What evidence
have you uncovered?

13:56.211 --> 13:57.629
We found a bloody knife
at the scene.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.838
Any fingermarks?

13:59.048 --> 14:00.006
- Several.
- Several?

14:00.216 --> 14:01.841
Well, it was a kitchen knife.

14:02.426 --> 14:05.095
Still, Higgins is about to take
statements and fingermarks.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.846
I'm convinced we'll have
the killer by noon.

14:07.056 --> 14:08.932
Noon?

14:09.140 --> 14:11.769
Well, afternoon.
Late afternoon.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.480
If you nail him by the time
that we're all ready for a pint,

14:14.687 --> 14:17.191
I'll kiss that bird
on the bleeding beak.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.072
Come in.

14:26.575 --> 14:27.993
Oh, good morning.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.163
Well, you've been busy.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.250
This is your night-vision apparatus?

14:36.043 --> 14:38.336
Not quite.
Almost.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.256
Parabolic, are they not?

14:42.674 --> 14:44.426
- You know about --
- Of course.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.386
It's what they use
in reflecting telescopes.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.681
I made one with Alwyn last year.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.515
You made one?

14:50.724 --> 14:51.892
I couldn't afford to buy one.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.226
Alwyn was so keen.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.979
So I found a book
at the library.

14:55.187 --> 14:56.563
There really wasn't much to it.

14:56.772 --> 14:59.149
Good morning! Mr. Murdoch.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.818
Good morning, Mrs. Burgess.

15:02.027 --> 15:04.779
I made you some eggs and beans
if that suits you.

15:04.989 --> 15:07.157
That's perfect.
Thank you.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.159
Mmm.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.458
What?

15:19.461 --> 15:21.879
I can't believe
you made a telescope.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.966
It turned out a bit blurry
after all that.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.552
I think the focal length
was off.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.808
Oh. Here.

15:34.018 --> 15:35.184
Let me.

15:55.205 --> 15:56.749
Oh, God.

15:57.374 --> 15:58.500
It's him.

15:59.751 --> 16:00.878
It's Pierre.

16:02.421 --> 16:03.297
Pierre LaRue.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.215
The proprietor
of the restaurant, correct?

16:06.091 --> 16:08.760
Mon bon ami.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.096
So you knew him well?

16:12.306 --> 16:14.515
15 years.

16:14.725 --> 16:17.894
We used to own a restaurant together
on Wilton Street.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.395
He was a brilliant chef.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.481
Right. Yes.
La Bonne Nu-it.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.359
La Bonne <i>Nuit.</i>

16:23.567 --> 16:25.235
Yes.
It's mine now.

16:25.443 --> 16:29.530
Pierre and I had a falling-out
a few years back --

16:29.740 --> 16:31.075
over a parrot, of all things.

16:31.283 --> 16:33.534
Oh, yes. I think we have
said bird in our care.

16:33.744 --> 16:35.037
In fact, if you'd like
to take possession --

16:35.245 --> 16:36.830
Good Lord, no.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.374
Horrid beast.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.042
Said the most terrible things.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.001
To the customers, no less.

16:42.211 --> 16:44.879
Do you know anybody who may have wanted
to hurt Mr. LaRue?

16:45.838 --> 16:50.259
Well, uh, I heard he had to fire
his sous-chef last week.

16:50.469 --> 16:51.678
For what reason?

16:51.886 --> 16:54.264
Some tiff over a crème brûlée.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.265
Came to blows, apparently.

16:56.475 --> 16:59.019
His kitchen staff
will be able to tell you more.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.312
Hmm.

17:01.522 --> 17:02.690
Yes.
Well, thank you, Mr. --

17:02.898 --> 17:04.232
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't get your name.

17:04.441 --> 17:07.653
Brighouse.
Hugo Brighouse.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.404
Thanks again.

17:13.200 --> 17:13.826
Oh, yes.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.451
Mr. Brighouse,
you wouldn't be able to tell me

17:15.661 --> 17:18.079
how he came to lose his finger,
could you?

17:19.163 --> 17:22.500
Pierre lopped that off years ago
while julienning carrots.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.752
Kept it pickled in a jar
as a reminder to his staff.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.465
What a character he was.

18:18.557 --> 18:19.474
Mr. Murdoch!

18:19.682 --> 18:21.143
What are you doing?

18:21.934 --> 18:24.104
I thought I heard someone
in the attic.

18:24.313 --> 18:27.065
Nonsense. No one's up there.
Now you come down!

18:27.273 --> 18:29.151
What do you think you're doing,

18:29.358 --> 18:32.028
gallivanting about
in your condition?

18:32.863 --> 18:36.074
I suppose it could be people next door.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.493
We do share
a common attic space.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.413
Most likely it's just squirrels.

18:41.622 --> 18:45.375
You get right back into bed,
and I will bring you some lunch.

18:45.584 --> 18:48.420
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm really not hungry.

18:52.508 --> 18:53.674
You're feverish.

18:54.384 --> 18:55.927
You know what your mother said.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.513
"Feed a fever, starve a cold."

18:58.721 --> 18:59.765
Actually, I think it's --

18:59.972 --> 19:01.224
No. Shh, shh. No.
Enough of that.

19:06.395 --> 19:09.191
So, what have you discovered, then,
Detective Crabtree?

19:09.398 --> 19:10.901
- Fisher, file these.
- Thank you, sir.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.903
Well, we've questioned
the restaurant staff.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.779
Higgins is checking
their alibis now.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.280
My money's on the sous-chef.

19:16.490 --> 19:17.324
Motive?

19:17.532 --> 19:18.616
He and the victim didn't get on.

19:18.826 --> 19:21.577
In fact, had a physical altercation
just last week.

19:21.787 --> 19:22.913
It's bad news, sir.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.789
All the restaurant staff's alibis
check out.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.375
Even the sous-chef?

19:26.583 --> 19:28.125
His presence
in the Laughing Beagle was noted

19:28.335 --> 19:30.837
by no fewer than four patrons
as well as the bartender, sir.

19:31.046 --> 19:33.006
That's impossible. His thumbmark
was on the murder weapon.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.925
Not to overstep my place,
Detective,

19:36.134 --> 19:37.260
but chefs use knives, sir.

19:41.265 --> 19:44.768
So, what's your next step, then,
Murdoch?

19:50.857 --> 19:53.109
William, what are you doing?

19:53.902 --> 19:55.403
Hello.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.739
Someone's removing
the lathing and plaster

19:57.948 --> 20:00.366
from the walls
in the house next door.

20:00.576 --> 20:02.743
Maybe they're doing some work.

20:03.537 --> 20:05.663
The owners are away.

20:05.873 --> 20:07.624
What better time
to have work done?

20:07.833 --> 20:09.585
Oh.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.086
Yes.
I suppose you're right.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.425
Are these
your night-vision goggles?

20:17.634 --> 20:19.720
- Oh, I wouldn't exactly --
- Can I try them?

20:19.928 --> 20:21.512
Be careful.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.809
Can't see anything.
Everything's too bright.

20:27.019 --> 20:30.646
That's because they're meant
to be used in the dark.

20:35.152 --> 20:37.069
Are you gonna eat your meat pie?

20:37.278 --> 20:38.822
- No.
- Can I have it?

20:39.030 --> 20:41.575
No. I don't want you to spoil
your appetite.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.869
Besides, Mr. Murdoch
needs his energy.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.413
That's all right.
I don't intend to eat it.

20:47.623 --> 20:49.916
Your fever's getting worse.
You need to eat.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.503
- Aaa...
- Aaa...

20:59.259 --> 21:00.301
How is it?

21:01.970 --> 21:03.888
Worse than Mrs. Kitchen's.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.646
Allô.

21:11.855 --> 21:14.273
Allô.
Welcome to Chez Pierre.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.483
Not now, parrot.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.402
Any new developments?

21:17.611 --> 21:19.570
No, sir. We've come to a bit
of a dead end.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.698
You go now.

21:21.906 --> 21:22.990
You go now.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.451
You get out of here.

21:25.661 --> 21:28.872
- You keep your beak shut.
- Cochon.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.499
You know what you have to do now,
don't you?

21:30.707 --> 21:32.334
Cochon.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.669
No, sir, I don't.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.545
Get to work.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.213
You didn't think
it was gonna be handed to you

21:37.422 --> 21:38.839
on a silver platter, did you?

21:39.048 --> 21:39.799
No, sir.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.843
Cochon. Cochon.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.512
I spit at you.
I spit at you.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.556
If you want spit,
I'll put you on a spit.

21:46.765 --> 21:47.848
That'll keep
your bloody trap shut.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.017
Mange le doigt.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.478
No. No.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.980
Mange your own bloody doigt,
you daft bird.

21:54.189 --> 21:56.273
Liven up, Crabtree.
Start thinking.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.280
Sir?

22:03.490 --> 22:05.575
Sir?
What was that all about?

22:05.784 --> 22:07.076
Oh, the inspector
was just giving us

22:07.285 --> 22:08.577
a bit of a dressing-down.

22:08.787 --> 22:09.453
Mm. Yeah.

22:09.663 --> 22:12.207
But why did he tell the parrot
to eat his own bloody finger?

22:12.415 --> 22:13.709
Eat his own fin--

22:13.916 --> 22:15.460
What?
Sorry. What?

22:15.669 --> 22:18.255
"Mange le doigt" is
"eat the finger" in French, sir.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.756
Bonjour.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.217
Welcome to Chez Pierre.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.070
Why can't we always be
like this?

22:43.654 --> 22:46.365
Because we want
different things.

22:46.575 --> 22:48.785
You want children.
You want a family.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.454
I only want you.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.540
That's not true, William.
You know it.

22:54.750 --> 22:59.628
All I know is that I will never love
anyone like I do you.

23:02.798 --> 23:05.093
We never love the same way twice.

23:05.301 --> 23:06.886
But you will love again.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.140
Love is like gravity, William.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.642
You have to let yourself fall.

23:21.484 --> 23:23.862
Alwyn!

23:34.080 --> 23:36.374
You should wake up now.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.500
Why?

23:37.709 --> 23:39.836
Because someone's in your room.

23:49.096 --> 23:50.513
No. No.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.270
Are you telling me that
that bloody parrot is a witness?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.690
Sir, the parrot said,
"Mange le doigt,"

24:00.898 --> 24:02.733
which means "eat the finger"
in French.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.945
And, of course, the victim had ingested
his own severed finger.

24:06.529 --> 24:07.614
Since when do you speak French?

24:07.823 --> 24:10.157
Oh, Higgins told me.
His mother hails from the Gaspé.

24:10.366 --> 24:12.201
Mm.
Eat the finger, eh?

24:12.410 --> 24:14.453
Sir, it's my theory
that the parrot

24:14.663 --> 24:17.332
is reliving the trauma
of the murder.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.416
What are you now --
a bird alienist?

24:19.625 --> 24:22.671
Well, it's just speculation
based on observation, really.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.964
But, yes, you and I are thinking
along the same lines.

24:25.173 --> 24:27.467
That's
a chilling thought, Crabtree.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.095
Sir!
It's Detective Murdoch.

24:30.303 --> 24:31.637
There's been some attempt
on his life.

24:33.056 --> 24:36.268
I'm telling you,
someone was in my room.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.435
He tried to smother me
with a pillow.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.147
Then why are you still alive?

24:41.355 --> 24:42.816
Perhaps he wasn't trying
to kill me.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.943
He was just looking
for something to steal.

24:46.153 --> 24:49.114
Like your night-vision goggles.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.825
You don't have much here
<i>to</i> steal, sir.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.826
It has something to do
with the noises.

24:54.035 --> 24:54.911
I'm sure of it.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.413
- Noises?
- Yes.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.958
From the attic.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.209
And the walls.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.712
Sir, is it possible you're having
a touch of delirium?

25:04.921 --> 25:06.756
I mean, you do have
one devil of a fever.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.425
But I'd already woken
from my dream.

25:09.634 --> 25:12.220
Yes, but do you know
how sometimes you can awake

25:12.429 --> 25:14.890
from one dream
into another dream?

25:15.097 --> 25:17.224
I mean, once I dreamt
that I could pull plums

25:17.433 --> 25:18.602
out of my navel.

25:18.809 --> 25:22.314
And then I woke, and there was still
a plum sticking out.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.693
There.
You hear that?

25:27.903 --> 25:29.278
I heard something.

25:29.487 --> 25:30.864
Someone's up there.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.449
Well, let's have a look,
shall we?

25:38.246 --> 25:40.039
There's no one up here, sir.

25:40.248 --> 25:41.708
Ah.

25:41.916 --> 25:44.251
That's your problem.
That's your prowler.

25:44.461 --> 25:45.878
- Oh.
- I'll sort it out.

25:47.588 --> 25:48.714
Oh!

25:50.383 --> 25:52.551
Sir!
Are you all right?

25:52.760 --> 25:53.720
No, I'm not.

25:53.929 --> 25:55.387
I'm sunk to my bloody pebbles.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.057
Oh.

25:57.641 --> 25:59.058
What were you thinking?

25:59.768 --> 26:02.354
We were investigating a noise
in the attic, ma'am.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.563
I tripped over a bolt.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.606
Simple clumsiness on my part.

26:06.191 --> 26:07.442
What a bolt was doing
sticking up

26:07.651 --> 26:08.943
through an attic floor
in the first place.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.028
What am I going to tell
Mrs. Kitchen?

26:11.654 --> 26:13.323
Poor thing.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.407
There she is,
watching her sister die,

26:15.616 --> 26:18.744
and then she has to come home
to this.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.538
It's all too much.

26:21.122 --> 26:22.289
Dreadfully sorry, ma'am.

26:22.499 --> 26:25.042
The police department
will pay for the damages.

26:25.794 --> 26:28.672
I accept your apology,
but I must please ask you to desist

26:28.880 --> 26:31.090
from wrecking Mrs. Kitchen's property
any further.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.217
Yes, ma'am.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.594
Right, then.
Back to work.

26:34.802 --> 26:37.888
But -- But, sir, we have to investigate
this further.

26:38.097 --> 26:41.809
Murdoch, there's nothing
to investigate.

26:43.728 --> 26:46.189
Do try to get some rest, sir.

26:57.992 --> 26:59.618
- Constable.
- Higgins!

26:59.827 --> 27:01.788
Uh, excuse me.
Detective.

27:01.997 --> 27:03.914
A Mr. Struthers to see you, sir.

27:04.124 --> 27:05.208
Ah.

27:05.416 --> 27:06.710
Ah.

27:06.917 --> 27:10.255
I understand
you have parrot troubles.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.715
He's here.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.843
I know he's here.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.635
William.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.054
William!

27:20.557 --> 27:22.392
How long has he been like this?

27:22.599 --> 27:24.435
Most of the morning, I'm afraid.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.145
He's got quite the fever.

27:26.354 --> 27:28.272
It's more than that.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.108
I'm going for help.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.987
I need you to apply
a cold compress to his forehead.

27:34.194 --> 27:35.447
Yes.
Of course.

27:42.537 --> 27:43.496
He's sleeping right now,

27:43.704 --> 27:46.040
but when he's awake,
he's very talkative.

27:46.249 --> 27:47.666
Ah.

27:49.044 --> 27:50.878
The African gray!

27:51.086 --> 27:53.006
Oh, smart bird.
Very smart.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.633
I captured one of those
in the Congo Free State

27:55.842 --> 27:57.301
as a gift for Beatrice.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.054
Princess Beatrice?
The queen's daughter?

27:59.261 --> 28:00.346
Mm.

28:00.930 --> 28:03.391
Cochon.
Tu es un cochon.

28:03.599 --> 28:06.394
Pig. You go.
You go now.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.313
Foul-tempered brute, what?

28:08.520 --> 28:09.564
You go.

28:09.772 --> 28:11.316
You get out of here.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.525
We best do as he says.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.318
We don't want to aggravate it
more than necessary.

28:14.527 --> 28:15.944
They hold grudges, these things,
you know.

28:16.153 --> 28:17.905
- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.

28:18.448 --> 28:22.035
So, do they understand
what they're saying, then?

28:22.242 --> 28:25.497
If you mean verb for verb,
suffix for suffix, no.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.789
But they get the gist of it.

28:26.998 --> 28:29.250
A parrot knows
when he's cussing you out.

28:29.459 --> 28:30.501
Oh, yes.
Sorry about that.

28:30.710 --> 28:31.836
No, they're fickle creatures.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.421
Like women and bull elephants.

28:33.630 --> 28:35.339
You never know
what they're going to do.

28:35.548 --> 28:36.673
Had one charge me once.

28:36.883 --> 28:39.219
Across a dry lake bed
in Tanganyika.

28:39.426 --> 28:40.636
A woman or an elephant?

28:40.845 --> 28:42.680
Ah, yes. That's very good.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.391
Oh.

28:44.598 --> 28:46.643
Mr. Struthers, is it possible

28:46.851 --> 28:48.685
that the bird is prone
to these outbursts

28:48.894 --> 28:51.355
because he's been upset
by the murder?

28:51.564 --> 28:54.108
I mean, do they have the mental capacity
for such trauma?

28:54.317 --> 28:55.192
Absolutely.

28:55.402 --> 28:57.862
These birds form
strong social attachments.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.280
They mate for life, you know.

29:00.865 --> 29:03.284
Still, he's very mercurial.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.119
I haven't been able
to figure out what it is exactly

29:05.327 --> 29:06.162
that sets him off.

29:06.371 --> 29:07.955
Well, it could be anything.
Could be my pipe.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.415
The clothes I'm wearing.

29:09.624 --> 29:12.544
Perhaps I remind him
of the murderer.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.884
Excuse me.
Dr. Ogden.

29:21.094 --> 29:22.136
Oh, hello, Mrs. Jones.

29:22.345 --> 29:24.305
It's William.
He's weak and feverish.

29:24.513 --> 29:25.973
Really?
Sounds like an infection.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.809
It's not just the fever.
It's -- It's the way he looks.

29:29.018 --> 29:31.938
Not everyone responds well
to mercury and opium.

29:32.146 --> 29:33.897
Perhaps I should go to him.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.153
Hyah!

29:40.779 --> 29:42.990
So, is it just you and your son?

29:43.199 --> 29:44.576
Alwyn. Yes.

29:46.243 --> 29:48.913
His father died two years past.
Quite suddenly.

29:49.497 --> 29:50.373
I'm sorry.

29:50.582 --> 29:52.416
That must have been
terribly difficult.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.251
It was.

29:54.461 --> 29:56.211
More for Alwyn than for me.

29:56.796 --> 29:59.382
I lost a husband,
but I gained a purpose.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.759
He had no such compensation.

30:02.384 --> 30:05.262
You seem to be managing
very well.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.182
Well, that's relative, isn't it?

30:07.390 --> 30:10.101
Look at you.
You're a doctor.

30:10.727 --> 30:12.103
That couldn't have been easy.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.356
No, it wasn't.

30:16.941 --> 30:20.444
I guess the things we care most about
are worth fighting for.

30:23.114 --> 30:25.200
Yes, I suppose they are.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.752
Hyah!

30:37.336 --> 30:39.881
Now, this
is going to hurt a bit.

30:48.181 --> 30:51.017
I thought your condition
would have improved by now.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.019
Have you been keeping
to your bed, William?

30:55.270 --> 30:56.314
More or less.

30:56.522 --> 30:59.858
Like a jack-in-a-box
keeps to his box.

31:00.484 --> 31:03.613
I'm taking you off opium.
That should quell the nausea.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.906
But I don't like the look
of you.

31:06.115 --> 31:07.700
I think I should stay for a bit.

31:07.909 --> 31:10.494
Oh, no, no, no.
I'll stay.

31:11.162 --> 31:13.080
I have nothing pressing
until dinnertime.

31:14.164 --> 31:17.000
Well, it's quite all right.
I'm free all afternoon.

31:17.751 --> 31:20.421
What this young man needs
is sleep.

31:20.630 --> 31:23.590
And he can't do that
with you two hens clucking.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.719
Shoo. Shoo.

31:31.516 --> 31:34.102
Promise me you'll keep
to your bed, William.

31:34.685 --> 31:37.396
Yes.
No more chasing strange noises.

31:41.984 --> 31:43.361
Now, Mr. Murdoch.

31:43.944 --> 31:47.574
I want you to eat this special
chicken soup I've made for you.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.656
Sir, it's my contention

32:29.865 --> 32:32.201
that the parrot is not reacting to you,
per se.

32:32.410 --> 32:34.369
But rather,
there's something about you

32:34.578 --> 32:36.413
that reminds him of the killer.

32:36.623 --> 32:38.082
You saying
I look like the killer?

32:38.290 --> 32:41.085
Both you and Mr. Struthers have
reddish hair and muttonchops.

32:41.294 --> 32:44.672
The parrot took an instant and vocal
dislike to both of you.

32:44.881 --> 32:47.924
Do any of your suspects
have red hair and muttonchops?

32:48.925 --> 32:50.094
Well?

32:50.677 --> 32:51.679
No, sir.

32:51.887 --> 32:52.930
So, what are you gonna do, then?

32:53.138 --> 32:56.017
Comb the city looking for men
with red hair and muttonchops?

32:56.893 --> 32:59.394
Crabtree, I believe
you can solve this case,

32:59.604 --> 33:00.646
but my patience
is running out.

33:00.855 --> 33:03.066
If I don't see any results
by tomorrow morning,

33:03.273 --> 33:05.526
I'm gonna bring Phillips in
from Station Three.

33:16.953 --> 33:18.914
Pshh. Shoo.

33:32.345 --> 33:34.430
I don't understand
why you're still so sick.

33:34.638 --> 33:36.348
Do you know
what your mother used to say?

33:36.557 --> 33:39.852
"Feed a fever, starve a cold."

33:44.856 --> 33:47.192
It's the food.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.820
I've been drugged.

35:17.407 --> 35:20.161
There's been reports
that the fugitive, Joel Harris...

35:20.369 --> 35:22.621
I want this station
to bring him in.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.867
Mr. Murdoch?

36:42.076 --> 36:45.954
I have a special drink
to settle your stomach.

37:30.708 --> 37:32.460
Emily?

37:34.253 --> 37:35.086
What's going on?

37:35.295 --> 37:38.007
What's happened to the lights
up there?

37:49.268 --> 37:50.644
Emily?

37:56.400 --> 37:57.777
Emily?

38:13.541 --> 38:15.628
I know you're up here, Murdoch.

38:18.047 --> 38:20.298
I can hear you breathing.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.722
You know...

38:26.931 --> 38:29.891
we never wanted to hurt you.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.605
But now...

38:35.188 --> 38:42.237
...you are not leaving me
any choice.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.416
Bonjour.

38:53.623 --> 38:55.126
Welcome to Chez Pierre.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.043
Try the pipe again.

38:57.253 --> 38:58.963
We tried the pipe already, sir.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.297
Oh, you're right.

39:00.505 --> 39:01.340
Bonjour.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.634
You can take that wig off
if you want.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.052
There must be something else
setting him off, but what?

39:10.266 --> 39:11.766
What are you doing, sir?

39:12.643 --> 39:14.186
Detective Murdoch
has these moments

39:14.394 --> 39:16.480
where he'll stare at a problem,

39:16.688 --> 39:19.150
and the answer
just comes to him.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.775
Bonjour.

39:23.820 --> 39:24.739
Cochon.
You go.

39:24.947 --> 39:25.780
Welcome to Chez Pierre.

39:25.989 --> 39:27.574
Get out of here.
Mange le doigt.

39:27.782 --> 39:28.659
Welcome to Chez Pierre.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.411
Cochon.

39:34.748 --> 39:36.208
Oh, it's no use.

39:36.416 --> 39:37.668
The inspector's right.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.670
"And you think
you're bloody Murdoch."

39:39.878 --> 39:41.963
Cochon!

39:43.715 --> 39:46.135
Right, then, parrot.
I've had just about enough of you.

39:46.342 --> 39:47.135
You want spit?

39:47.344 --> 39:48.429
- I'll put you on a spit.
- Cochon.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.389
- That'll shut your trap!
- Cochon.

39:50.972 --> 39:52.766
Cochon.
You are a pig.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.393
The parrot is not remembering...

39:54.601 --> 39:56.103
- ...the way the killer looked.
- It's his accent, sir.

39:56.311 --> 39:57.813
I say, old boy!

39:58.021 --> 39:59.481
Cochon. Cochon.

39:59.690 --> 40:02.068
You go.
You get out of here.

40:02.275 --> 40:03.527
You go.

40:03.735 --> 40:04.778
You go.

40:04.987 --> 40:07.655
You get out of here.
You get out of here.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.324
Hugo. Hugo.

40:09.532 --> 40:12.452
Brighouse.
Hugo Brighouse.

40:14.454 --> 40:15.998
Henry...

40:16.206 --> 40:18.291
I believe our mystery is solved.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.150
Mrs. Kitchen.

40:45.652 --> 40:46.653
Oh.

40:46.862 --> 40:49.989
It was just <i>so</i> dreadful.

40:51.784 --> 40:53.494
And I thought she was my friend.

40:53.702 --> 40:56.789
And a-a church friend, no less.

41:00.333 --> 41:03.003
Mrs. Kitchen, did they say
what they were after?

41:03.211 --> 41:04.420
No.

41:04.630 --> 41:08.050
But I do know it was something
that belonged to Mr. Christie.

41:12.096 --> 41:14.931
H-He used to rent the room
that y-you're in now.

41:15.141 --> 41:17.351
He did it in exchange
for work around the house.

41:17.559 --> 41:21.896
He was shady character,
let me tell you.

41:22.398 --> 41:25.568
He did some of the most lovely
plasterwork, though.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.574
Oh, dear.

41:32.782 --> 41:34.409
W-We'd best hurry.

41:42.835 --> 41:46.005
Mrs. Kitchen, I need your help.

41:46.213 --> 41:47.463
You...

41:47.672 --> 41:48.965
My help?

42:01.061 --> 42:02.813
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.231
Tell me where he is.

42:05.940 --> 42:06.983
All right.

42:07.193 --> 42:07.902
He's...

42:08.652 --> 42:11.487
...right behind you.

42:11.697 --> 42:13.449
Aah!

42:27.378 --> 42:28.963
- Ha!
- Aah!

42:32.092 --> 42:33.469
Mr. Murdoch!

42:35.804 --> 42:38.181
- Oh.
- Oh, Mrs. Kitchen.

42:38.766 --> 42:40.768
I need you to do me
one more favor.

42:40.976 --> 42:42.853
Of course, my dear.
W-What is it you want?

42:43.646 --> 42:45.356
Get help.

42:46.981 --> 42:47.983
Oh.

42:48.192 --> 42:49.525
Help. Yes.

42:49.735 --> 42:51.152
Help.

42:54.614 --> 42:55.865
When he opened
his own restaurant,

42:56.074 --> 42:57.867
I-I took it rather badly.

42:58.077 --> 42:59.452
I played a prank.

42:59.661 --> 43:00.746
He retaliated.

43:00.954 --> 43:03.581
So I retaliated.
And so on.

43:03.791 --> 43:06.418
Until things went too far.

43:06.626 --> 43:11.047
He hid his pickled finger
in my shrimp salad.

43:11.673 --> 43:13.300
It was beyond the pale.

43:13.509 --> 43:17.054
So... I confronted him
that night.

43:17.262 --> 43:18.554
After closing.

43:18.764 --> 43:21.016
And you forced the finger
down his throat?

43:22.518 --> 43:23.936
Yes.

43:26.438 --> 43:28.773
And then he picked up a knife.

43:28.983 --> 43:34.737
And the next thing I knew,
there was blood everywhere.

43:36.155 --> 43:37.992
Pierre.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.286
He claims it was an accident, does he?

43:41.494 --> 43:42.496
I believe him, sir.

43:42.704 --> 43:44.081
He seems genuinely grieved.

43:44.289 --> 43:45.541
They used to be good friends, you know.

43:45.748 --> 43:47.543
Until the parrot
came between them.

43:47.751 --> 43:49.295
Now, why doesn't that
surprise me?

43:50.336 --> 43:52.213
So, what's gonna happen
to that bloody bird?

43:52.422 --> 43:54.340
Mr. Struthers has offered
to release him

43:54.550 --> 43:57.719
into the wilds of the Congo
on his next trip to Africa.

43:57.927 --> 44:01.222
You've done a passable job on this case,
Detective Crabtree.

44:01.889 --> 44:02.766
Well, faint praise.

44:02.974 --> 44:05.311
But from you, sir, I'll take that
as the highest compliment.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.532
Well, the infection has receded.

44:18.740 --> 44:20.242
The chloral hydrate
they were feeding you

44:20.451 --> 44:22.202
was weakening your defenses.

44:22.411 --> 44:25.121
- How do you feel?
- Better.

44:25.331 --> 44:26.706
Indeed.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.291
Your fever's gone.

44:28.500 --> 44:29.418
And the pain?

44:29.626 --> 44:31.085
I can bear it.

44:32.338 --> 44:34.672
Yes, I know you can.

44:40.219 --> 44:42.347
I just heard.

44:42.556 --> 44:43.724
Are you all right, William?

44:43.931 --> 44:44.891
I'm fine.

44:45.099 --> 44:48.603
Well... what on earth happened?

44:48.811 --> 44:50.731
It's a long story.

44:50.938 --> 44:53.525
Yes. Well, I should leave you
to tell it.

44:55.235 --> 44:56.652
Thank you, Dr. Ogden.

44:57.653 --> 44:59.739
You're welcome, Detective.

45:08.998 --> 45:10.291
Is it true?

45:11.960 --> 45:14.713
Is Mrs. Burgess really
a confidence trickster?

45:14.922 --> 45:15.630
Yes.

45:16.215 --> 45:19.009
A former tenant stashed
some stolen gold in this house.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.052
His cell mate
found out about it.

45:21.260 --> 45:24.764
And his cell mate was none other
than Mrs. Burgess' boyfriend.

45:24.972 --> 45:27.809
They decided to retrieve it
but didn't know where it was hidden.

45:28.018 --> 45:29.436
So all those noises you heard?

45:29.644 --> 45:31.521
Them searching.

45:31.730 --> 45:33.565
But why imitate
a little old lady?

45:33.773 --> 45:36.652
When they learned
that a police officer was living here,

45:36.860 --> 45:38.403
they needed a credible way inside.

45:38.612 --> 45:41.280
What they hadn't planned on
was my being here all the time.

45:41.489 --> 45:42.824
So the charade grew.

45:43.032 --> 45:43.951
Precisely.

45:44.159 --> 45:44.992
They poisoned my food,

45:45.202 --> 45:48.121
hoping to search
while I was incapacitated.

45:48.664 --> 45:51.916
And after all that,
they still didn't find the gold.

45:52.126 --> 45:53.001
Shame.

45:53.585 --> 45:55.503
It could have paid
for all this damage.

45:57.338 --> 45:59.090
He did some lovely plasterwork.

45:59.298 --> 46:00.384
What was a bolt doing
sticking up

46:00.592 --> 46:02.719
through the attic floor
in the first place?

46:08.057 --> 46:10.561
Oh, I suspect it will be found.

46:11.103 --> 46:12.646
In fact, later we could --

46:19.695 --> 46:21.320
Was that too bold?

46:23.532 --> 46:24.740
No.

46:25.324 --> 46:27.619
When I saw you lying there yesterday,

46:27.827 --> 46:30.289
I thought that I might lose you.

46:31.248 --> 46:32.666
And I'd only just found you.

46:35.168 --> 46:38.922
I plan on being here
a good long time.

46:40.507 --> 46:42.217
Good.
