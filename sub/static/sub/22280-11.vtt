00:06.633 --> 00:09.800
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero,

00:12.300 --> 00:15.333
as winter fades, Alaskans
take their final shots.

00:17.567 --> 00:20.700
A crafty predator rattles
the Hailstones' strategy.

00:20.733 --> 00:22.400
I got ripped off
by a wolverine.

00:22.433 --> 00:25.033
NARRATOR: Glenn races
against the wild
to protect his food stock.

00:25.067 --> 00:28.700
GLENN: My main concern is that
nothing finds these caribou
before I get them back.

00:28.733 --> 00:31.833
NARRATOR: The Salitans
hunt for big game
in winter's twilight.

00:31.867 --> 00:33.967
ERIK: These are
the most nourishing animals
that you can harvest.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.467
NARRATOR: And Sue's escape
from Kavik
leads to a grave mistake.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.767
SUE: I want to get the hell
out of camp.

00:55.233 --> 00:57.933
SUE: Some things,
some chores build up.

00:57.967 --> 00:59.233
Is it gonna kill you
if it builds up?

00:59.267 --> 01:01.633
No, but it's unpleasant.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.467
My chores are just on
a different scale.

01:09.267 --> 01:11.300
It's happy with the bucket
going down.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.800
Lifting it is inconsistent.

01:13.833 --> 01:17.233
Dumping overhead,
it's a little inconsistent.

01:17.267 --> 01:19.467
I'm not sure what causes that.

01:21.567 --> 01:23.500
NARRATOR: The unforgiving
landscape in the tundra

01:23.533 --> 01:26.400
forces Sue Aikens to complete
a variety of tasks

01:26.433 --> 01:29.367
to ensure her safety
at Kavik River Camp.

01:31.767 --> 01:34.067
Drifts are a constant hazard
throughout,

01:34.067 --> 01:35.467
and to clear them,

01:35.500 --> 01:39.400
Sue relies on one of the most
important tools, the Bobcat.

01:43.967 --> 01:45.367
Come on, pig!

01:46.233 --> 01:47.467
Come on!

02:01.133 --> 02:02.500
All right.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.500
Walking up to it, I see...

02:08.533 --> 02:11.067
"What the hell is that?"
Is what I'm thinking.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.500
It's not oily.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.367
My Bobcat is done.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.700
I need to look at the manual.

02:19.733 --> 02:22.067
I need, I need to
dig into it more.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.300
Um, just another can of worms

02:26.133 --> 02:27.367
in Sue's worm farm.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.067
When I first noticed
the issue,

02:29.100 --> 02:31.200
I said, "Man,
that doesn't smell right."

02:31.233 --> 02:33.667
I thought it smelled like
burnt hydraulic fluid,

02:33.700 --> 02:35.733
um, which was my panic
about the hydraulics,

02:35.767 --> 02:38.467
and that would answer why
things weren't working right.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.533
Nobody should get
emotionally trashed

02:40.567 --> 02:44.067
over a 24-year-old
frickin' Bobcat.

02:44.067 --> 02:45.933
I don't look at
what does it cost

02:45.967 --> 02:47.867
when it was brand-new,
I look at replacement cost.

02:47.900 --> 02:50.633
These things are
in the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

02:50.667 --> 02:51.900
I don't have it.

02:51.933 --> 02:54.300
I don't wanna whine about it.
I wanna get on to my next job.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.867
GLENN: It's not all
adventure and excitement.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.500
A lot of times it's really
quiet out here,

02:59.533 --> 03:02.367
but that's just as
important to me
as the other times.

03:16.167 --> 03:17.667
All through the winter
I'm butchering meat.

03:17.700 --> 03:22.600
I produce quite a lot
of scraps and bones,
crust on my moose.

03:22.633 --> 03:25.333
What I do with them,
when I've got a bone
that I'm done with,

03:25.367 --> 03:27.300
I just throw it out
the window.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.767
And they accumulate out there.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.567
I got quite a pile.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.667
This is my bird feeder.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.500
I got an ermine
that eats on it.
I really enjoy watching

03:37.533 --> 03:39.433
the little critters coming up
and eating.

03:39.467 --> 03:41.467
But, at this time of year,
the bears are starting to
come out pretty soon,

03:41.500 --> 03:44.233
so I have to clean the yard up
and I've gotta move all
this stuff out.

03:44.267 --> 03:47.367
'Cause it's just likely
to attract bears.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.933
NARRATOR: The warming weather
in the Brooks Range

03:48.967 --> 03:52.400
is a sign bears will soon
awaken from hibernation.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.633
It is crucial for Glenn
to move his food scraps

03:54.667 --> 03:58.733
offsite for his own
protection and survival.

03:58.767 --> 04:00.633
So I'm gonna take all of this,
load up the sled,

04:00.667 --> 04:03.833
and bring it over to that
island out on the lake.

04:03.867 --> 04:05.367
Nothing goes to waste.

04:06.467 --> 04:09.833
I got everything I could use
off of this.

04:09.867 --> 04:14.067
But a wolverine or a bear
will come and
eat up the rest of it.

04:24.200 --> 04:27.233
There is no food that evolved

04:27.267 --> 04:28.967
in order to feed
something else.

04:29.067 --> 04:32.600
Even the plants, well,
they're trying to survive,

04:32.633 --> 04:34.900
and then something comes along
and eats them up.

04:34.933 --> 04:37.667
A moose is trying to survive,
and something comes along
and eats it up.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.067
That's what food is.

04:39.067 --> 04:42.500
Food is one species
taking another and
turning it into itself.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.433
Suffering is part of life.
I suffer, too.

04:44.467 --> 04:48.067
Someday I'm gonna die
and things are probably
gonna eat me up.

04:48.067 --> 04:49.367
Hopefully.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.200
The cycle of life and death

04:51.800 --> 04:54.067
is what makes life real.

04:54.067 --> 04:57.800
I cleaned the scraps
and the bones up
from my front yard.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.200
Right here is where I dump.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.633
At the end of this island.
I've been leaving bones

05:00.667 --> 05:02.833
and scraps of meat
here for years.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.267
The wolverines, the bears,
they know this spot.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.367
They come over here
and clean it up in the spring.

05:11.767 --> 05:13.833
I'd rather have them
eat it over here
than right at my front door.

05:13.867 --> 05:17.267
So it's a real hungry country,
and everything gets used.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.933
You just can't leave something
laying on the ground

05:18.967 --> 05:20.067
for more than
a couple of weeks

05:20.067 --> 05:21.200
before something cleans it up.

05:23.700 --> 05:27.633
AGNES: I never, ever am
scared to be out here
or anything like that.

05:27.667 --> 05:28.767
I don't ever feel lost.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.100
I always know that I'm on top
of the world,

05:31.933 --> 05:33.400
way up in the north.

05:40.733 --> 05:43.300
We woke up,
and it's a pretty crappy day.

05:43.333 --> 05:44.900
It's overcast,
it's hard to see,

05:44.933 --> 05:47.933
there's been blowing snow,
and there's a lot of wind.

05:47.967 --> 05:51.200
So we got our traps
out of our cache.

05:51.233 --> 05:53.300
We're gonna go make
at least one set.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.467
NARRATOR: Last summer,
the Hailstones built a cache

05:55.500 --> 05:57.567
at their camp in Kiwalik
to store hunting

05:57.600 --> 06:00.333
and trapping gear for
the winter harvest.

06:00.367 --> 06:01.667
CHIP: We are always
getting ready.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.167
We're always getting ready
for the next season.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.733
All of summer is just nothing
but a preparation

06:04.767 --> 06:06.167
for the winter ahead,
and the winter is nothing

06:06.200 --> 06:07.667
but a preparation for
the summer ahead.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.733
NARRATOR: Today, they will
set traps for game fur,

06:10.767 --> 06:15.167
a vital product for income
and trade within
their native community.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.500
Okay, I think
I'm good up here.

06:16.533 --> 06:19.767
We actually make more money
and catch less animals

06:19.800 --> 06:21.467
because we do
a lot more work to them.

06:21.500 --> 06:25.067
And for us, we don't need
to have 20 wolves to
make our year.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.833
We need five or ten.

06:26.867 --> 06:30.067
And we can make more money
than the guy
that got 20 wolves.

06:30.067 --> 06:31.900
If the goal for somebody
is $1,000,

06:31.933 --> 06:34.300
and it takes 50 foxes
to make that,

06:34.333 --> 06:35.933
they'll have to
catch 50 foxes.

06:35.967 --> 06:40.067
If we wanna make $1,000,
we'll catch five foxes,
and make five hats,

06:40.067 --> 06:41.533
and we'll have that
thousand bucks.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.233
So we're actually impacting
a lot less

06:43.267 --> 06:45.700
because we take the, um,
process a lot further.

06:45.733 --> 06:48.533
Let's go boil some water.

06:48.567 --> 06:52.300
AGNES: When
we're out here, um,
dealing with traps and stuff,

06:52.333 --> 06:54.467
we try not to put
our human scent on them.

06:54.500 --> 06:58.433
Take this pot
and fill it up with snow.

06:58.467 --> 07:02.533
Get the tops of these willows
and throw them in.

07:03.367 --> 07:05.533
Prop even some of these
right here.

07:05.567 --> 07:08.300
They'll make it like
scent-free from humans.

07:08.333 --> 07:11.500
Not everybody can live
this kind of lifestyle.

07:11.533 --> 07:15.067
For most women, it would
probably be hell.
(LAUGHS)

07:15.067 --> 07:20.200
So while I'm in here making
the water for Chip's traps,
he's out there making sure

07:20.233 --> 07:22.333
our sleds are gonna be
running fine.

07:22.367 --> 07:23.733
We're out in the wilds
of nature,

07:23.767 --> 07:25.633
so the chances of us seeing
anything are pretty good.

07:25.667 --> 07:26.900
You never know
what you'll see,

07:26.933 --> 07:28.600
and you don't know
until you see it.

07:28.633 --> 07:30.933
We're kind of curious.
We want to get going.

07:30.967 --> 07:33.133
The nice thing about leaving
our traps in the country is

07:33.167 --> 07:35.300
they never get
any human scent,

07:35.333 --> 07:37.500
or fuel, or anything on them.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.300
AGNES: There's hardly
any people around this area,

07:49.333 --> 07:52.367
but, uh, they kind of know
where me and Chip trap,

07:52.400 --> 07:56.400
so hardly anybody ever bothers
our trap line.

07:56.433 --> 07:58.800
I'm just gonna stay
right here,
so I don't put my scent

07:58.833 --> 08:01.600
-all over your trap line.
-Yeah, good idea.

08:01.633 --> 08:03.733
This is old salmon and bacon.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.967
Ugly, yucky, chunky pieces
of bacon.

08:08.067 --> 08:09.833
And foxes love this shit.

08:09.867 --> 08:11.467
Gonna set this aside.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.333
Gonna make a place
right here where I can
set it into a groove.

08:14.367 --> 08:16.400
We offer them a little
something to munch.

08:17.533 --> 08:19.100
We want these foxes to

08:19.133 --> 08:21.233
come over here
and check it out.

08:21.267 --> 08:23.067
They'll be able to smell stuff
around here,

08:23.067 --> 08:24.633
little pieces of this
and that.

08:24.667 --> 08:26.533
We'll even give them
a little freebie or two.

08:26.567 --> 08:28.700
They'll have to
come over here and
figure it out themselves.

08:28.733 --> 08:32.200
We come here in the summer,
so we kind of know
where these foxes live.

08:32.233 --> 08:34.067
We know where the dens are.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.367
Just stick some fur here,

08:36.467 --> 08:38.200
cover it up.

08:38.233 --> 08:39.600
And they can think
it's a kill.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.667
And then here I'll make
a tassel for the wind,

08:42.700 --> 08:44.133
that way I can find my...

08:45.700 --> 08:47.367
My trap if I need to.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.167
Now I'm gonna go set another
one over here.

08:52.067 --> 08:53.800
This is what we call
a killer trap.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.533
What will happen is, a fox
will come over here

08:55.567 --> 08:57.500
and he'll, he'll take
a bite of that

08:57.533 --> 08:59.600
or try to get a hold of that,
and it will spring the trap

08:59.633 --> 09:01.500
around his head
and break his neck.

09:01.533 --> 09:03.300
It's a quick,
it's a quick death.

09:03.333 --> 09:04.967
It's a humane way
of killing it.

09:05.067 --> 09:08.067
And we'll just check
this every day.
Because if they get killed,

09:08.067 --> 09:09.400
um, we don't want ravens
pecking on them,

09:09.433 --> 09:11.100
we don't want other animals
running off with them,

09:11.133 --> 09:13.600
and we don't want, uh,
stuff to happen to them.

09:13.633 --> 09:16.500
So, since we're pretty close,
we'll just go check
these every day.

09:16.533 --> 09:17.833
At least maybe a couple
of times a day.

09:17.867 --> 09:19.733
AGNES: That was the last one,
yeah?

09:19.767 --> 09:20.900
Yep. That's two of them.

09:20.933 --> 09:22.867
This is just the first
of many.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.767
We'll get them all set,
and they'll start producing.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.900
It's like a fishing line.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.133
You don't just cast it
and get a hit,

09:29.167 --> 09:31.100
come on,
that's a pretty rare day.

09:31.133 --> 09:32.867
You gotta let that bait soak
for a while.

09:32.900 --> 09:35.633
And then the fish come along,
and you go home
with something.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.267
ERIK: This is an awesome
time of year.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.867
I get to go out and enjoy
this great country,

09:45.900 --> 09:48.367
and just get to love nature
out there with my wife,

09:48.400 --> 09:50.333
and just have a kickass time.

10:09.367 --> 10:10.467
(MARTHA LAUGHS)

10:12.000 --> 10:13.800
This time of year,
large herds of caribou

10:13.833 --> 10:16.033
come through the south side
of the Brooks Range here,

10:16.067 --> 10:18.633
near where Martha and I live.

10:18.667 --> 10:21.467
NARRATOR: In Wiseman,
the transition from winter
to spring

10:21.500 --> 10:25.067
offers a brief window to hunt
caribou as they migrate.

10:25.100 --> 10:29.200
It is an essential source
of meat and protein
for the Salitans.

10:29.233 --> 10:30.600
ERIK: We've seen some tracks
up high.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.733
Martha and I are gonna
hop on the sled.

10:34.733 --> 10:36.700
We're gonna go up the valley,

10:36.733 --> 10:39.667
go to a likely place
where the caribou first start
to congregate usually,

10:39.700 --> 10:41.433
and see if there's anything
around yet.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.700
The caribou is the animal
to hunt at this time of year.

10:44.733 --> 10:46.200
You always look forward to
eating some

10:46.233 --> 10:49.600
fresh caribou meat after
eating moose all winter.

10:49.633 --> 10:52.767
At this time of year,
we're gonna target
large, mature bull caribou.

10:54.533 --> 10:56.600
Martha shot some fox
this past winter.

10:59.433 --> 11:00.500
(GUNSHOT)

11:01.433 --> 11:03.067
That's all good and
that's fun.

11:03.067 --> 11:05.267
Predator hunting in the winter
is one of my favourite
things to do,

11:06.567 --> 11:07.567
but it's cold.

11:09.133 --> 11:11.133
It's not really fun
'cause you're like,

11:11.167 --> 11:13.433
always, "I gotta stay warm,
keep my hands warm,

11:13.467 --> 11:16.567
"keep my face warm. Oh, shit,
my nose is falling off.
I'm frozen."

11:18.400 --> 11:20.067
Life is good in the spring
in the Arctic.

11:20.100 --> 11:23.300
This is easy.
There's no bugs,
and it's not cold.

11:35.067 --> 11:36.567
MARTHA: If we come up on
any caribou,

11:36.600 --> 11:39.567
I'd like to be the first
person to fire off a round,

11:39.600 --> 11:43.200
being that Erik's killed
a lot of animals
in his lifetime,

11:43.233 --> 11:47.067
so it's nice for me to
be able to pull the trigger
now and then.

12:00.667 --> 12:03.400
ERIK: I see lots of tracks,
lots of diggings.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.467
Ooh! Ooh!

12:07.500 --> 12:08.700
-You know what I see?
-What's that big old thing
over there?

12:08.733 --> 12:09.867
It's a muskox!

12:09.900 --> 12:12.267
-No way.
-There's a muskox over there.

12:17.933 --> 12:20.933
There's a caribou
in the bushes

12:20.967 --> 12:24.633
like ten yards away
from the muskox.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.500
-Do you wanna...
-Yep. There's two cari...

12:28.067 --> 12:30.500
I take that back,
there are three caribou.

12:31.900 --> 12:34.133
Let's see if we can't get
ourselves a little bit closer.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.467
(ERIK WHISPERING)

13:00.467 --> 13:01.467
(GUN FIRING)

13:10.067 --> 13:11.767
ERIK: You got one, I got one.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.100
Good shooting.

13:13.133 --> 13:15.667
The really awesome thing
about what just
went down here,

13:15.700 --> 13:17.767
outside of my wife
just shot a caribou,

13:17.800 --> 13:19.567
I just shot a caribou,

13:19.600 --> 13:23.833
is these caribou were hanging
out with this muskox,
which is totally unusual.

13:23.867 --> 13:25.600
There's a muskox
100 yards away from us,

13:25.633 --> 13:30.067
just hanging out,
doing muskox things,
and that's awesome.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.400
Walking over to check out
the caribou Martha
and I just got.

13:33.433 --> 13:34.833
She shot one. I shot another.

13:34.867 --> 13:37.567
Gonna have some good,
fresh spring meat.

13:43.433 --> 13:45.867
Here we are at springtime
in the Brooks Range of Alaska.

13:45.900 --> 13:49.067
I'm with the best hunting
partner I've ever had
in my entire life, my wife.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.500
She just made a really
awesome shot.

13:51.533 --> 13:54.067
Perfect heart shot
on this adult bull caribou.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.367
The other caribou ran,

13:56.400 --> 14:01.233
I hit one, and then
I had to shoot it again, and
then the third one got away.

14:01.267 --> 14:03.067
You know, as a guide
I get to do a lot of hunting.

14:03.067 --> 14:05.767
I'm used to taking other
people and letting other
people shoot.

14:07.167 --> 14:09.067
Martha likes to shoot,
I'm cool with that.

14:09.067 --> 14:10.533
But as soon as she gets
her animal down,

14:10.567 --> 14:12.067
I'm pretty quick to
grab the gun away

14:12.100 --> 14:13.567
from her and
shoot one for myself.

14:14.900 --> 14:16.133
MARTHA: Look at that heart.

14:17.967 --> 14:19.100
ERIK: We got two
on the ground.

14:19.133 --> 14:20.933
We can use more than
two probably,

14:20.967 --> 14:23.267
but two will definitely
get us going.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.767
SUE: The comfort
of your own life

14:27.800 --> 14:30.600
has a direct relationship
to how hard you work

14:30.633 --> 14:32.533
to keep it
the way you want it.

14:32.567 --> 14:36.567
Chores are something
that you keep up on
to keep your quality of life.

14:45.833 --> 14:48.067
I was having a problem
with the Bobcat.

14:48.067 --> 14:49.533
I thought
the hydraulic system.

14:49.567 --> 14:51.167
Everything pointed
to hydraulics.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.533
I busted out the old manual,
looked at it.

14:53.567 --> 14:55.800
It's the radiator itself
that's shot,

14:55.833 --> 15:00.367
and that's not an easy fix
for me right now.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.733
NARRATOR: Even though clearing
the camp has been put on hold,

15:02.767 --> 15:06.233
Sue has to turn her attention
to another essential task

15:06.267 --> 15:08.833
in order to keep Kavik
up and running.

15:08.867 --> 15:11.433
SUE: I've got a generator
I need to do a change on.

15:11.467 --> 15:13.867
Um, you know,
I've got some other chores.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.633
This is the new oil filter.

15:15.667 --> 15:19.700
I worry that,
what if this son of a bitch
doesn't wanna start back up?

15:19.733 --> 15:23.667
Did I catch all the problems?
What? What? What? What?
If? If? If?

15:23.700 --> 15:26.200
I mean, you make yourself
crazy with that.

15:33.167 --> 15:36.400
I put oil already on the seal
any time you're putting
a new filter on,

15:36.433 --> 15:40.067
so that as you're slipping it
against your hard plate,

15:40.067 --> 15:41.600
it can slip and snug tight.

15:41.633 --> 15:43.067
This old oil.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.633
And then I take my waste oil,
and I throw it in here.

15:46.667 --> 15:49.800
You know, always under
the impression
try to leave things clean.

15:49.833 --> 15:52.100
Leave it ready and set up
for the next time.

15:57.267 --> 16:00.367
And it's just a little bit
higher than my dots,

16:00.400 --> 16:04.400
which is good,
and that gives me enough fuel,

16:04.433 --> 16:09.467
enough oil in there
that it needs to
fill your filter.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.067
Now the test. We'll go around,
see if we can turn him over.

16:15.067 --> 16:16.433
(GENERATOR STARTING)

16:18.067 --> 16:20.667
Now we'll let it run
for a moment.

16:20.700 --> 16:24.133
That allows the oil to
circulate through the motor

16:24.167 --> 16:26.633
and also fill up
that oil filter,

16:26.667 --> 16:29.067
so it will be nice and warm

16:29.100 --> 16:31.867
when I ask it to
deliver the power.

16:31.900 --> 16:35.267
Then I'll run out and check
if the lights came on

16:35.300 --> 16:37.067
in the front of camp.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.533
And then this job is done.

16:51.933 --> 16:54.633
All right.
I see a light there.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.100
I see a light there.

16:56.133 --> 16:57.467
It is running.
Power is being delivered.

16:57.500 --> 17:01.467
Both spotlights in front
have come on.
Good enough for me.

17:02.267 --> 17:04.467
So, boom, one job done.

17:04.500 --> 17:07.067
The equipment in camp
is my spouse.

17:07.100 --> 17:09.333
I'm having
an emotional response

17:09.367 --> 17:11.100
to my equipment
having a headache.

17:11.133 --> 17:13.967
I want to get the hell
out of camp.

17:14.067 --> 17:20.433
No expectations, no jobs,
just get out and yay!
Have some fun.

17:20.467 --> 17:22.800
AGNES: I don't really like
working for other people.

17:22.833 --> 17:26.400
Me and Chip,
we enjoy living out here,
and we work for ourselves,

17:26.433 --> 17:28.733
and it's a cleaner living,
we think.

17:29.533 --> 17:30.967
We're happy.

17:31.067 --> 17:33.067
So whatever makes you happy.

17:43.933 --> 17:45.500
(CHIP SPEAKING)

17:46.633 --> 17:48.667
I'm gonna go out
and come back.
Same circle.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.200
I'm not gonna go far. I'm just
gonna go off and go see

17:51.233 --> 17:54.067
if I could catch a couple
ptarmigan for your trap.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.767
I love you.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.767
I'll see you later. Be safe.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.167
You be safe, too.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.700
-Yep.
-(ENGINE STARTING)

18:01.733 --> 18:04.267
NARRATOR: After recently
crashing her snow machine...

18:06.933 --> 18:09.067
AGNES: There goes my ride.

18:09.067 --> 18:12.100
My handlebars
won't even turn.

18:12.133 --> 18:15.200
...field repairs have
Agnes' vehicle up and running

18:15.233 --> 18:18.167
and will allow the Hailstones
to divide and conquer.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.267
While Chip inspects
the trap line,

18:20.300 --> 18:23.267
Agnes will hunt ptarmigan
for food and bait.

18:35.667 --> 18:37.067
Huh.

18:37.067 --> 18:39.267
Well, I don't see any prints,
though,

18:39.300 --> 18:41.067
so nothing's come over here
and disturbed it.

18:41.067 --> 18:42.667
I guess I'm gonna let
this one soak some more.

18:56.133 --> 18:57.400
Look at that.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.767
It got the bait and all.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.267
Oh! Look at this!

19:02.167 --> 19:04.067
That's about the size
of a wolverine.

19:04.100 --> 19:07.133
They're real faint 'cause...
What can I say but

19:07.167 --> 19:08.533
I got ripped off by
a wolverine.

19:08.567 --> 19:11.900
(LAUGHS)
The wolverine came over,
he saw it was a trap,

19:11.933 --> 19:14.200
and he beat it or he hit it.

19:14.233 --> 19:16.267
He moved it completely
out of the way.

19:16.300 --> 19:17.967
Ah, such is life.

19:18.067 --> 19:19.567
I'm gonna get on the snow
machine and go check
the next one.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.267
(LAUGHING)
I think he's checking
my traps for me.

19:26.767 --> 19:27.867
AGNES: I saw a few ptarmigan,

19:27.900 --> 19:30.333
and I decided to go try
and catch dinner

19:30.367 --> 19:32.767
and at the same time
get some feathers

19:32.800 --> 19:37.767
and, um, some of the skin
for the traps Chip's setting.

19:40.667 --> 19:43.900
I'm looking for
white ptarmigan on white snow.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.067
Look for that one white head.

19:46.100 --> 19:49.433
I know they're around here
someplace.
I just gotta find them.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.300
Ptarmigan. Yay.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.633
I should have two around
there somewhere.

20:09.967 --> 20:11.133
Yes!

20:12.667 --> 20:17.400
I went and took
a couple shots,
and I just scored a couple.

20:17.433 --> 20:20.367
You gotta really keep
your eyes on them.
They're white.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.300
Hey!

20:22.333 --> 20:23.700
I knew I got two of them.

20:23.733 --> 20:26.633
I'm gonna take these two,
and I'm gonna go find Chip.

20:26.667 --> 20:30.400
He'll breast them and, um,
he can use the rest for bait.

20:30.433 --> 20:33.533
And then we can go home
and go make us
some ptarmigan dinner

20:33.567 --> 20:35.033
and call it a day.

20:37.533 --> 20:39.433
CHIP: I'm just checking
my trap line.

20:39.467 --> 20:41.867
Basically, I check on it,
I see if there's
animals in it,

20:41.900 --> 20:43.967
or I see if they've done
any damage.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.867
Um, I see if they're
covered over,

20:45.900 --> 20:48.633
and I maintain them
so that they're still easily
snappable and operable.

20:48.667 --> 20:51.567
And when I can, I put in new
ones and expand my trap line.

20:55.667 --> 20:58.767
AGNES: You were right.
If I kept on trying
and kept on trying,

20:58.800 --> 21:00.533
I'd score. I got two of them.

21:00.567 --> 21:01.967
-CHIP: All right.
-(AGNES LAUGHS)

21:02.067 --> 21:03.133
Instead of eating
the whole thing,

21:03.167 --> 21:04.400
we breast them out
and use the backs,

21:04.433 --> 21:06.133
the wings, and the heads.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.733
-Hang on.
-Look, there's
a perfect breast.

21:09.767 --> 21:12.700
That one that you shot,
look at that,
it went right there.

21:12.733 --> 21:14.867
-Almost ruined it.
-No.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.733
Almost doesn't count.

21:16.767 --> 21:18.767
Now look at all them guts
and that backbone,

21:18.800 --> 21:21.067
and I'm gonna make
a link set out of this guy.

21:22.167 --> 21:24.267
I think out of each ptarmigan
I can get two sets.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.933
I can probably cut them
right in half and use a leg

21:26.967 --> 21:29.100
and wing on one,
and the back end.

21:29.133 --> 21:32.400
And then I could use the head
and wing and leg
on the other side.

21:32.433 --> 21:35.567
Right on.
Now we even got bloody gloves
to work on our traps.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.367
Yep.
They smell like ptarmigan.

21:38.267 --> 21:39.633
Tear off these feathers.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.700
Just scatter them around.

21:51.633 --> 21:54.067
Okay. That's about the way
it works.

21:54.067 --> 21:55.300
-Pretty good, eh?
-Yeah.

21:55.333 --> 21:57.400
-You wanna go home,
call it a day?
-Yeah.

21:57.433 --> 22:00.600
We'll come back
out here tomorrow,
have a look.

22:10.300 --> 22:13.067
SUE: The older I get,
the more I break myself.

22:13.067 --> 22:15.500
I slow down, everybody does.
Age happens.

22:15.533 --> 22:18.367
Show me the expiration date,
then I know how to live.

22:35.267 --> 22:36.767
Look at the sky, Ermie!

22:36.800 --> 22:39.100
You know, I've had a lot
of frustrations this winter.

22:39.133 --> 22:41.667
With the Bobcat,
you're talking a 24-year-old

22:41.700 --> 22:44.867
piece of equipment
that's been beat
harder than it should be beat,

22:44.900 --> 22:48.300
asking it to do things
that a big loader does.

22:48.333 --> 22:53.167
So I can't see
the solution right now.

22:53.200 --> 22:57.600
I kind of wanna put Kavik on
the back burner in my brain,

22:57.633 --> 23:01.067
grab the snow machine,
and go camping for a night.

23:01.100 --> 23:05.700
Have a fun little night
and camp out,
get some perspective back.

23:10.633 --> 23:12.767
This is just a day trip.

23:12.800 --> 23:18.267
I haven't been out of Kavik
for personal reasons
in a long time.

23:18.300 --> 23:22.367
I haven't been able
to get out and camp

23:22.400 --> 23:24.133
since, I don't know,
last summer.

23:24.167 --> 23:27.333
I got to go for what?
Another over-nighter?

23:27.367 --> 23:31.333
Um, it's nice to get
your head out of the game.

23:32.233 --> 23:33.200
Okay.

23:33.233 --> 23:36.267
I think I'm ready to get
the... Zip this up.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.067
All righty.

gut this last one, and you

24:47.967 --> 24:49.467
walk back and
get the snow machine?

24:49.500 --> 24:51.367
-Okay, sounds good.
-Go get it.

24:55.267 --> 24:57.200
ERIK: Martha's going
to grab the sled.

24:57.233 --> 24:59.067
I'm just gutting this last
caribou, and then we can

24:59.067 --> 25:01.700
load them up
and get out of here.

25:01.733 --> 25:04.300
These aren't good animals
to eat throughout the winter,

25:04.333 --> 25:07.067
but come springtime,
they're fattening up again.

25:07.067 --> 25:08.633
They're real run down
throughout the winter,

25:08.667 --> 25:10.333
after the late fall
breeding season.

25:10.367 --> 25:12.067
But by this time of year,
the cows,

25:12.067 --> 25:14.933
their bodies are stressed
with reproduction

25:14.967 --> 25:16.500
and these are
the fattest, healthiest,

25:16.533 --> 25:18.467
most nourishing animals
that you can harvest.

25:20.367 --> 25:22.100
Got the second one gutted out.

25:22.133 --> 25:25.067
I'm going to go follow up
the tracks here
on that third one now,

25:25.067 --> 25:28.600
and make sure that
I didn't wound it.

25:28.633 --> 25:31.467
I sure thought I hit it,
but it didn't look hit.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.133
It ran off
into the forest there.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.133
There's its track right here.

25:36.167 --> 25:38.133
I'll follow this caribou
up a little bit

25:38.167 --> 25:39.533
and make sure
I didn't hit him.

25:41.500 --> 25:44.300
This is where I shot at him
right here, he was running.

25:49.800 --> 25:53.567
I followed the tracks about
100 yards, and we got blood.

25:54.633 --> 25:56.767
You can't leave
a wounded animal behind.

26:00.067 --> 26:01.800
(WHISPERING)
I knew I hit the third one.

26:01.833 --> 26:03.367
There's a bunch of
blood there.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.500
-It's right up there.
-Where's it at?

26:04.533 --> 26:06.267
I already saw it,
it's over there.

26:13.367 --> 26:14.933
(GUNSHOT)

26:14.967 --> 26:17.900
I know I hit it,
but it's still moving.
We're out of bullets.

26:17.933 --> 26:19.533
But you have that knife still.

26:19.567 --> 26:22.467
Yeah, maybe it's
slowed down enough
I can get him with a knife.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.567
Let's go. Come on.

26:28.733 --> 26:30.200
(PANTING)

26:36.100 --> 26:41.767
NARRATOR: In Alaska, leaving
a wounded caribou to suffer
is illegal and unethical.

26:41.800 --> 26:45.767
The Salitans are out of ammo,
so Erik is forced
to harvest the animal

26:45.800 --> 26:47.600
in an ancient fashion.

26:50.167 --> 26:51.500
I wanted all three.

26:51.533 --> 26:53.533
Three's the number we need,
so I didn't have any

26:53.567 --> 26:56.600
choice but to try to get
this caribou with a knife.

26:56.633 --> 26:58.567
And I just kind of
eased up on it and

26:58.600 --> 27:03.900
finished it in the most
humane way I could,
which was across the throat.

27:03.933 --> 27:07.533
That's nature.
It's not real pretty,
but he'll eat all right.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.133
We got a lot
of caribou to cut up.

27:11.167 --> 27:13.900
MARTHA: This land here
provides a lot of opportunity.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.833
You just got to go out and
find it as far as animals go.

27:16.867 --> 27:19.167
You know, Erik and I can't go
to the grocery store
and be like,

27:19.200 --> 27:20.867
"Oh, that's what
we want for dinner.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.167
"Oh, that's what
we want for dinner."

27:22.200 --> 27:23.933
We got to go out
and get it ourselves.

27:23.967 --> 27:26.567
So it's very fulfilling
to be able to go out

27:26.600 --> 27:28.167
with the person
you love, you know,

27:28.200 --> 27:29.633
and go and spend time
out in the woods

27:29.667 --> 27:32.233
and come home
with some fresh meat.

27:32.267 --> 27:33.467
It's way better than
getting in your car

27:33.500 --> 27:36.233
and going
to the grocery store.

27:36.267 --> 27:39.300
The good is
we're all squared away
on red meat for a while.

27:39.333 --> 27:42.500
The bad is, it's a lot of
work to do in one day.

27:42.533 --> 27:44.200
One, two, three.

27:47.433 --> 27:50.767
SUE: Life can surprise me
by showing me my wall and

27:50.800 --> 27:54.500
reminding me not to get too
proud and too full of myself.

27:54.533 --> 27:57.167
I am pleased
that I still have a mind

27:57.200 --> 27:59.067
that can come up
with the ingenuity

27:59.067 --> 28:02.467
of, "Yeah,
so I can't do it your way.
But I can do it this way."

28:10.467 --> 28:14.567
I'll get my stuff,
throw it on,
find rope, tie it down...

28:15.233 --> 28:16.833
Boom! Out of here.

28:16.867 --> 28:20.633
I'm not going far.
I'm just going to get away.

28:20.667 --> 28:23.333
You know, if it gets
too dark and I worry
about it, I'll stop.

28:23.367 --> 28:26.167
You know, that's the
nice thing about going for fun

28:26.200 --> 28:28.067
instead of going on a mission.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.500
On a mission,
you got to get somewhere.

28:29.533 --> 28:32.967
There's, you know, something
pulling your strings.

28:33.067 --> 28:34.600
(ENGINE STARTING)

28:36.567 --> 28:39.700
NARRATOR: Sue is awaiting
parts to fix her machinery.

28:39.733 --> 28:44.233
In the meantime,
a night away from Kavik
is a much-needed retreat.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.567
I kind of like this spot.

28:56.600 --> 29:00.133
I saw a bunch of birdies.
I can see some
roosting over this way.

29:00.167 --> 29:03.400
It's kind of nice.
I'd like get the tent up
before dark.

29:03.433 --> 29:06.600
You know, right in here
would be a good little spot.

29:09.367 --> 29:12.900
I may have to get
my other little hat on
in a second.

29:12.933 --> 29:14.700
It's easy, you know,
the sun's going down.

29:14.733 --> 29:16.400
It's going to get cool fast.

29:16.433 --> 29:19.933
So that's why I wanna
get the little tent set up.

29:19.967 --> 29:22.833
The sun sets here,
sun rises there.

29:22.867 --> 29:24.900
This is a real quick
trip for me.

29:24.933 --> 29:28.167
This is just what
the doctor Sue ordered.

29:30.233 --> 29:33.533
I am even more remote
than I am at camp.

29:33.567 --> 29:38.167
This is just me and whatever
nature's going to give me.

29:38.200 --> 29:42.600
It's just meant to be,
"Don't stress,

29:42.633 --> 29:46.800
"It's not a major expedition.
There's no focal point
I have to achieve

29:46.833 --> 29:49.533
"other than a little R and R."

29:51.867 --> 29:55.233
Even though I've got some
stuff going south at camp,

29:55.267 --> 29:58.100
meaning my equipment
and whatnot,

29:58.133 --> 30:00.600
maybe I'll just have
a nice day and have some fun.

30:00.633 --> 30:05.600
No major point
to my activities
other than my enjoyment.

30:10.333 --> 30:12.200
GLENN: I just feel really well
living out in nature,

30:12.233 --> 30:13.800
and this is a place
where I can do it.

30:13.833 --> 30:15.600
There aren't that many places
left in the world

30:15.633 --> 30:17.267
where you can
still live this way.

30:17.300 --> 30:18.800
There's a lot of
freedom out here.

30:30.567 --> 30:33.267
NARRATOR: After moving his
food scraps to a nearby island

30:33.300 --> 30:35.367
to protect his camp
from bears,

30:35.400 --> 30:38.233
Glenn must now retrieve
the last of his buried caribou

30:38.267 --> 30:40.300
before predators
can discover it.

30:41.900 --> 30:45.033
A few days ago,
I killed five caribou

30:45.067 --> 30:47.333
to the east of my camp
here in the forest.

30:47.367 --> 30:50.367
Since then, I've been
moving them back to camp.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.333
I'm headed out
to get my fifth load,
the last caribou.

30:53.367 --> 30:55.500
There was no way
I was going to get them
all back that night.

30:55.533 --> 30:58.433
So what I had to do was,
I decided to just gut them.

30:58.467 --> 31:01.100
The only thing I could do
to protect them
was bury them with snow.

31:01.133 --> 31:03.067
I'm coming over each day
and getting more caribou

31:03.067 --> 31:05.067
and bringing them
back to camp.

31:06.667 --> 31:10.333
It's a lot of weight to move.
It takes a lot of time.

31:10.367 --> 31:12.600
And time is of the essence
because my main concern

31:12.633 --> 31:16.133
is that nothing
finds these caribou
before I get them back.

31:16.167 --> 31:17.900
What's this here?

31:17.933 --> 31:20.700
It looks like a wolverine
came right through here.

31:20.733 --> 31:23.067
Wolverines are gluttons,
they'll eat a lot of meat.

31:23.067 --> 31:24.733
And even if
they can't eat it all,

31:24.767 --> 31:27.300
they'll just take pieces of it
and hide it in different
places in the snow.

31:27.333 --> 31:29.633
They'll urinate on it,
poop on it,
make a mess of it.

31:29.667 --> 31:33.733
If he finds that caribou
before I get to it,
that's going to be a problem.

31:42.633 --> 31:44.600
I just saw a snowshoe hare
running through here.

31:44.633 --> 31:47.267
I think it disappeared into
that tree well right there.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.433
(GUN COCKING)

31:49.467 --> 31:51.200
There it goes.

31:56.433 --> 31:57.667
(CHUCKLES)

31:57.700 --> 31:58.733
They're pretty fast.

31:58.767 --> 32:00.433
He was over there.

32:00.467 --> 32:02.600
NARRATOR: On his way
to retrieve a stash
of caribou meat,

32:02.633 --> 32:06.867
Glenn has encountered
a chance at adding
to his spring food stockpile.

32:06.900 --> 32:08.500
There's lots of snowshoe hare
sign here.

32:08.533 --> 32:11.333
There's some droppings.
See where he's
been sitting here.

32:11.367 --> 32:13.100
It looks like
that one got away.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.800
Right here,
this big pile of snow,

32:22.833 --> 32:25.167
that's where
I left the caribou.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.400
I don't see any
tracks around it.

32:27.433 --> 32:29.567
Other than the ones I made
when I was burying it,

32:29.600 --> 32:31.067
I don't see
any fresh tracks in here.

32:31.067 --> 32:33.267
It doesn't look like
anything found it.

32:33.300 --> 32:36.333
This looks good.
Nothing got into it.

32:37.833 --> 32:41.467
The snow is really hard now
because I disturbed it,

32:41.500 --> 32:45.067
and I piled it all up here.
It set up hard.

32:45.100 --> 32:48.333
I'm going to have
to dig through that.
It's not going to be easy.

32:48.367 --> 32:54.467
When I buried the caribou,
it was soft snow like this,
but now it's really hard.

32:54.500 --> 32:58.067
It's all set up.
I'm going to use this
snowshoe to uncover it.

33:00.567 --> 33:01.933
There it is.

33:01.967 --> 33:03.300
A caribou hoof.

33:04.167 --> 33:05.833
A caribou's right under there.

33:05.867 --> 33:07.433
It looks good.

33:07.467 --> 33:10.833
I just got a lot of work to
dig this all out
with a snowshoe.

33:10.867 --> 33:13.900
But nothing else
dug into here.

33:13.933 --> 33:16.567
The snow kept
the sun off of it,
preserved the meat,

33:16.600 --> 33:18.700
it kept the birds
from finding it,

33:18.733 --> 33:22.067
and luckily, the wolverine
didn't smell it
and get to it before I did.

33:26.167 --> 33:28.300
That caribou
is really frozen in.

33:28.333 --> 33:32.700
There's no way I can
pull that out of there.

33:32.733 --> 33:37.100
The snow is good
for protecting the caribou,
but it's hard to get it out.

33:40.167 --> 33:42.067
It's starting to come loose.

33:42.067 --> 33:43.567
I think I can get it now.

33:44.533 --> 33:45.700
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

33:46.467 --> 33:47.567
I got it.

33:50.533 --> 33:51.567
Caribou.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.967
One caribou.

33:54.067 --> 33:56.800
Whole, frozen,
ready to take home.

34:01.267 --> 34:04.167
My guess is this weighs
somewhere around 250 pounds.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.633
It's a lot of weight.

34:06.667 --> 34:10.100
I'm going to get it home,
protect it there
where I can watch it,

34:10.133 --> 34:11.700
keep an eye on it,
make sure nothing gets to it.

34:11.733 --> 34:13.433
All the time it was
out in the field,
there was a chance of

34:13.467 --> 34:16.567
something getting it.
But now I got it,
it's secure.

34:23.633 --> 34:27.300
Of course pulling
a load like this,
it's a lot of work.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.900
Of course it's a little easier
now that I got the trail.

34:29.933 --> 34:31.767
Without a trail, it's pretty
tough getting around,

34:31.800 --> 34:33.533
especially if you've got
a load to carry in the sled.

34:37.933 --> 34:40.100
Got the caribou back.

34:40.133 --> 34:41.633
I got to it before
anything else found it.

34:41.667 --> 34:44.767
I got enough meat there
to last me a month,
so I'm happy about that.

34:46.667 --> 34:49.333
CHIP: Instead of being rich,
we went for happiness.

34:50.067 --> 34:51.367
So to hell with money.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.667
I mean, we need it,
but it's not
the centre of our life.

35:08.100 --> 35:09.467
Hi, fox. What's up?

35:09.500 --> 35:11.700
He's watching us, but he's
not really afraid of us.

35:13.167 --> 35:14.667
That is a nice cherry fox.

35:14.700 --> 35:17.567
It would make a nice, warm hat
and a nice, warm
pair of mittens.

35:19.633 --> 35:21.367
He knows I'm a predator,
and he's going to get

35:21.400 --> 35:23.333
fairly close,
but not too close.

35:23.367 --> 35:24.900
He's got a really nice skin,
and if we happen to

35:24.933 --> 35:27.133
get him incidentally, we'd
rather get him in the trap

35:27.167 --> 35:28.567
rather than shoot him.
We don't want holes in him.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.800
We don't want the bruised part
to the leather.

35:31.833 --> 35:33.467
We'll just leave him be
for what he is.

35:33.500 --> 35:36.367
This guy right here is just
cleaning up our mess.
It's all good.

35:37.600 --> 35:40.233
Once we check our traps,
we'll just stay low, too.

35:41.267 --> 35:43.467
It's not a good day to
hunt up in the ridges.

35:46.433 --> 35:48.200
The satisfaction I've gotten
out of my life

35:48.233 --> 35:51.167
has always been probably
personal satisfaction.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.467
I don't know what makes
other people tick.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.233
I don't even
give a damn, actually.

35:54.267 --> 35:56.733
But this is what I like to do.

35:56.767 --> 35:59.567
This is where I like to be.
It's a lot of fun.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.533
I'm my own boss.
I get to go where I want,
when I want.

36:02.567 --> 36:05.233
I take my snow machine
where I think I can take it,

36:05.267 --> 36:07.667
and I'm pretty much
left alone to it all.

Too bad for the raven.

36:28.333 --> 36:30.367
The raven must have
come for the skin, too.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.800
So the fox looks nice.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.900
He's not even
frozen on his leg.

36:38.933 --> 36:40.533
He hasn't
been here long at all.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.867
This is nice.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.633
This is a nice
red cherry fox,
real easy for our little,

36:45.667 --> 36:48.167
young girls to
start sewing with.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.267
Our daughters can make a hat.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.200
If you had to
put a value on it,

36:51.233 --> 36:53.633
at probably $250 to $300
apiece for a hat

36:53.667 --> 36:56.367
just like they made
for their mom
that she's wearing right now.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.400
AGNES: You can make
a real pretty hat.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.233
CHIP: Yep.

37:00.267 --> 37:02.700
Put him on the ground
if it's fine with you.

37:06.733 --> 37:08.267
-(EXHALES)
-AGNES: There you go.

37:08.967 --> 37:10.467
CHIP: No holes,

37:10.500 --> 37:11.933
except for where
you hit it with the .22.

37:11.967 --> 37:14.667
So this guy here, he's not
going to be a bit wasted.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.067
There's no problem with it.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.067
His meat will be fine.
His skin is fine.

37:18.067 --> 37:21.767
He's profitable to us,
and he's a good start
to some trapping around here.

37:22.500 --> 37:23.567
That's pretty nice.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.533
It's a little tacky
right now, but

37:25.567 --> 37:27.867
we'll take it inside
and we'll wash it.

37:27.900 --> 37:30.067
-Stretch it.
-And we'll stretch it
on a stretcher,

37:30.067 --> 37:32.167
and we'll start
cleaning off the flesh.

37:35.133 --> 37:37.367
You cut the throat
so their spirit

37:37.400 --> 37:40.733
can go to the
happy hunting grounds.

37:42.300 --> 37:43.867
CHIP: We are the top predator.

37:43.900 --> 37:46.767
We hunt the wolves,
we hunt the bears,
wolverine, everything.

37:46.800 --> 37:49.167
That's us.
So we're a part of this.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.733
We're just
the apex of this all.

37:50.767 --> 37:54.200
When our time comes,
we'll be recycled
back into it.

37:54.233 --> 37:56.633
I think in the very end,
just becoming
a turd in the tundra

37:56.667 --> 37:59.100
is going to be like the best
thing we can hope for.

37:59.133 --> 38:01.133
Leave no mark behind.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.067
MARTHA: I would prefer that
when Erik and I

38:09.100 --> 38:10.500
are driving around
on our snow machine

38:10.533 --> 38:12.433
and we come to a crossroads,
that a wolf runs across

38:12.467 --> 38:14.200
instead of a car
driving across.

38:14.233 --> 38:16.300
You know,
that's what's great about
living in the wild out here,

38:16.333 --> 38:18.733
is that every day you
walk out your door

38:18.767 --> 38:20.500
and something is different,
instead of every day

38:20.533 --> 38:23.133
you walk out your door and
everything is the same.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.900
Martha and I just
got back to the house.

38:40.933 --> 38:42.633
We put on some pretty
good miles today.

38:42.667 --> 38:46.233
Got some premium
spring meat here,
some big bull caribou.

38:46.267 --> 38:48.733
Oh, these are nice,
big ones you got, honey.

38:48.767 --> 38:50.100
Let me help you out here.

39:00.100 --> 39:02.133
There's king crab,

39:02.167 --> 39:05.500
there's lobster,
there's foie gras,

39:05.533 --> 39:06.467
there's oysters.

39:06.500 --> 39:09.167
-I love oysters.
-That's all shit.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.267
Caribou tongue is
the best thing there is.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.867
The best way to
get at the tongue

39:13.900 --> 39:18.400
is to cut along the jaw here
and get back to the larynx.

39:18.867 --> 39:20.167
I love my wife.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.267
I don't think we fight more
than any other couple.

39:22.300 --> 39:24.433
But every time
we kill an animal
we get in a fight,

39:24.467 --> 39:25.933
'cause we're always fighting
over the tongue.

39:25.967 --> 39:27.133
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

39:28.267 --> 39:30.100
MARTHA: I grew up eating
these kinds of things,

39:30.133 --> 39:32.500
so I guess you kind of
require a palate
for these kinds of things.

39:32.533 --> 39:38.100
Tongue isn't something that
most people probably wanna
be eating for their dinners.

39:38.133 --> 39:40.400
ERIK: Whoo! We'll be
eating good tonight.

39:42.333 --> 39:44.867
What do you think?
Not too shabby.

39:44.900 --> 39:46.700
So two are mine, one is yours?

39:47.267 --> 39:48.267
No.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.800
We'll arm wrestle
for that later.

39:55.533 --> 39:58.567
MARTHA: Just boiling it
in a little bit of salty
water, that's all.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.200
Plain and simple, the best
way to eat the tongue.

40:02.767 --> 40:05.333
You could put it in a soup
or do what you wanted with it,

40:05.367 --> 40:07.467
but we just like
straight tongue.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.900
I'm going to let them boil for
about an hour and a half.

40:11.933 --> 40:15.767
The longer you boil them,
the more tender they'll be,

40:15.800 --> 40:19.000
so usually we get
impatient and only
let them boil for an hour.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.767
How's those tongues coming?

40:24.800 --> 40:27.000
Good. They've been boiling
for an hour and a half.

40:27.033 --> 40:28.333
ERIK: Oh, boy.

40:28.367 --> 40:30.100
Let's eat them.
I can't wait any longer.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.733
This is the fattest
part of the animal.

40:36.767 --> 40:39.967
This is what
the animals go for
on a caribou, too.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.333
The wolves always
eat the tongue.

40:41.367 --> 40:43.100
I'm so excited right now.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.667
ERIK: It's a really
complicated recipe.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.633
It involves boiling and salt.

40:53.667 --> 40:55.700
-MARTHA: Mmm.
-(PEPPER SHAKER RATTLING)

40:57.733 --> 40:59.100
ERIK: This is candy.

40:59.133 --> 41:00.567
This is a candy meal.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.133
This doesn't even
count as a meal.

41:02.167 --> 41:06.500
I could eat 50 meals
and be so full
and be like, "Mmm, tongue?

41:06.533 --> 41:08.067
"How much can I have?"

41:08.833 --> 41:10.667
You're going to
burn your mouth.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.433
Mmm.

41:12.467 --> 41:16.133
Winter's pretty much over,
the light's coming back,
caribou coming through.

41:16.167 --> 41:17.600
Pretty soon
the birds will be here.

41:17.633 --> 41:20.467
The bears will be coming out.
We'll be guiding bear hunts.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.600
Before you know it
the salmon will be in,

41:22.633 --> 41:25.233
and we'll be guiding
fisherman and netting fish.

41:25.267 --> 41:28.433
And this was a nice cap
to the season though.

41:28.467 --> 41:29.467
Yeah, it was.

41:30.633 --> 41:32.700
We're about to pass out
of a tongue coma.

41:34.567 --> 41:35.700
Eep!

41:35.733 --> 41:37.067
-(EXHALES)
-Ugh.

41:55.767 --> 41:57.167
SUE: I'm just packing up camp.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.200
Um, it was just supposed
to be a little shorty trip.

42:00.233 --> 42:02.433
And I needed it. It was nice.

42:02.467 --> 42:04.367
Get out where there's
absolutely no noise,

42:04.400 --> 42:07.400
absolutely no lights except
the ones nature provides.

42:13.233 --> 42:15.533
-I still want to explore.
I'm not done.
-(ENGINE STARTING)

42:15.567 --> 42:18.800
But in the background,
camp is on my mind.

42:18.833 --> 42:22.200
But it is definitely time
for me to get back
and get that ball rolling.

42:22.233 --> 42:25.767
That's where
I've got to concentrate
my brain power right now.

42:25.800 --> 42:29.367
I've got a whole lot
of gnarly to get through
before I can get to the nice.
