WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:04.275
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL, ELEGANT,
CLASSY WOMAN.

00:04.275 --> 00:08.039
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE GONNA END UP ALONE.
 BREE PREPARED FOR DIVORCE,

00:08.039 --> 00:10.481
BUT ORSON HAD OTHER PLANS.

00:10.481 --> 00:14.145
YOU KNOW, INSURANCE FRAUD
IS A SERIOUS CRIME.
 YOU WOULD ACTUALLY SEND
YOUR WIFE TO PRISON?

00:14.145 --> 00:17.188
MY WIFE? NO.
MY EX-WIFE? YOU BET.

00:17.188 --> 00:21.522
NOW YOU WANNA TAKE IN
A TEENAGER?
 CARLOS DID THE RIGHT THING.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.024
THIS IS WHAT FAMILY DOES
FOR EACH OTHER.
 DR. HELLER'S DEAD.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.326
AMATEUR SLEUTHS...

00:25.326 --> 00:27.158
MY GUESS--THE PERSON HE WAS
COMING TO SEE

00:27.158 --> 00:29.360
IS THE PERSON WHO KILLED HIM.
 ZEROED IN ON THEIR PREY.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.433
DAVE.
 I HAD TO KILL M.J. DELFINO.

00:32.433 --> 00:36.137
AND DAVE MADE A VIDEO.
 DON'T WATCH IT TILL YOU GET
BACK FROM HONEYMOON.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.209
HAVE A NICE WEDDING.
 THANKS.

00:38.209 --> 00:41.542
YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY BOY,
OKAY?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.474
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

00:43.474 --> 00:46.217
(shifts gear)

00:54.555 --> 00:57.188
(ticking)

00:57.188 --> 00:59.460
(Mary Alice) THE FIRST THING
LILA DASH THOUGHT ABOUT

00:59.460 --> 01:03.634
THAT FATEFUL MORNING
WAS HER HUSBAND DAVE.

01:03.634 --> 01:08.369
IT OCCURRED TO HER
SHE SHOULD BUY HIM A NEW TIE.

01:10.541 --> 01:15.276
SHE THOUGHT OF HER HUSBAND
AGAIN THAT AFTERNOON...

01:15.276 --> 01:20.211
AND DECIDED SHE WOULD MAKE HIM
SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR DINNER.

01:22.082 --> 01:26.457
THAT EVENING, LILA ONCE AGAIN
THOUGHT ABOUT HER HUSBAND...

01:26.457 --> 01:29.460
(speaking inaudibly)
 AND SHE ASKED HERSELF
WHAT SHE HAD DONE

01:29.460 --> 01:31.292
TO DESERVE SOMEONE

01:31.292 --> 01:33.864
SO WONDERFUL.

01:36.867 --> 01:40.201
HEY, YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

01:40.201 --> 01:43.304
NOTHIN'.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.635
(utensil clatters)

01:44.635 --> 01:47.638
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE ALL GO OUT FOR ICE CREAM?

01:47.638 --> 01:50.441
OH, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I BROUGHT WORK HOME.

01:50.441 --> 01:51.882
AGAIN?

01:51.882 --> 01:53.884
I KNOW. I'M SO BORING.

01:53.884 --> 01:56.547
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TWO GO?

01:56.547 --> 01:58.889
NO. WE'LL ALL GO TOMORROW.

01:58.889 --> 02:03.154
NOW HOW CAN YOU MAKE THIS FACE
WAIT A WHOLE DAY FOR ICE CREAM?

02:03.154 --> 02:05.696
(whispers) LOOK SAD.

02:05.696 --> 02:07.528
(normal voice) YEAH. (laughs)
 OH!

02:07.528 --> 02:09.229
OH, FINE.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.532
I'LL TAKE HER NOW.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.534
COME ON, SWEETIE.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.839
HEY,
HOW ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT,

02:18.839 --> 02:21.342
I'LL LEAVE MY BRIEFCASE
AT THE OFFICE,

02:21.342 --> 02:24.815
AND WE DO SOMETHING SPECIAL,
JUST THE THREE OF US?

02:24.815 --> 02:29.220
IT'S A DATE.

02:33.284 --> 02:34.785
(door closes)

02:36.287 --> 02:42.162
BUT THERE WOULD BE NO TOMORROWS
FOR LILA AND PAIGE DASH...

02:42.162 --> 02:46.166
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE NIGHT
THEY CRASHED...

02:46.166 --> 02:48.939
INTO SUSAN AND MIKE DELFINO.

02:48.939 --> 02:51.672
(tires screech, horn honks)

02:59.380 --> 03:03.814
THE LAST THING LILA DASH
THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE SHE DIED

03:03.814 --> 03:06.817
WAS HER HUSBAND DAVE.

03:06.817 --> 03:10.321
SHE WONDERED WHAT HER DEATH
WOULD DO TO HIM.

03:16.497 --> 03:20.601
LUCKILY FOR LILA,

03:20.601 --> 03:22.973
SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.988
THERE WAS A WEDDING RECENTLY

03:37.988 --> 03:41.952
AT FAIRVIEW
PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.

03:41.952 --> 03:46.627
THE MINISTER SPOKE ABOUT
THE NATURE OF MARRIAGE

03:46.627 --> 03:48.959
AND THEN SAID
WHAT ALL MINISTERS SAY

03:48.959 --> 03:52.002
TO CONCLUDE SUCH MATTERS.

03:52.002 --> 03:55.666
YOU MAY NOW KISS THE BRIDE.

03:55.666 --> 03:57.768
(bells tolling)

03:57.768 --> 04:01.912
IT WAS THEN THE CHURCH BELLS
BEGAN TO RING,

04:01.912 --> 04:05.716
TELLING BRIDES-TO-BE EVERYWHERE

04:05.716 --> 04:08.619
THEIR TURN WAS NEXT.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.982
HELLO, GROOM.

04:11.982 --> 04:13.784
GUESS WHAT?

04:13.784 --> 04:15.786
I CALLED THE HOTEL TO TELL THEM
WE WERE GETTING MARRIED.

04:15.786 --> 04:17.788
THEY PROMISED
TO UPGRADE US TO A SUITE

04:17.788 --> 04:19.990
AND HAVE CHAMPAGNE ON ICE.

04:19.990 --> 04:22.733
ISN'T THAT TERRIFIC?
 YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

04:22.733 --> 04:25.736
WOW, I HOPE YOU CAN MUSTER UP
A LITTLE MORE ENTHUSIASM

04:25.736 --> 04:27.968
FOR THE "I DOs."

04:27.968 --> 04:30.641
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST THINKING
ABOUT SUSAN AND M.J.

04:30.641 --> 04:32.002
WHY?

04:32.002 --> 04:35.706
WELL, WHEN THEY LEFT, I JUST
GOT A WEIRD VIBE FROM DAVE.

04:35.706 --> 04:39.279
DAVE ALWAYS GIVES OFF
A WEIRD VIBE. THAT'S JUST DAVE.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.281
NO, I-I THINK
I SHOULD CALL 'EM.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.984
OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GET OUR BAGS IN THE CAR

04:43.984 --> 04:46.987
SO WE DON'T MISS OUR FLIGHT?
BECAUSE IF WE MISS OUR FLIGHT,

04:46.987 --> 04:48.989
WE'RE GOING TO MISS
OUR WEDDING DAY,

04:48.989 --> 04:50.991
AND IF WE MISS
OUR WEDDING DAY,

04:50.991 --> 04:53.063
WE'RE GONNA MISS
OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

04:53.063 --> 04:54.925
(kisses)

04:54.925 --> 04:57.498
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.971
I'M PROBABLY WORRIED ABOUT
NOTHING. I'LL LOAD THE CAR.

05:00.971 --> 05:03.003
UH, WE NEED TO STOP
AT THE STORE.

05:03.003 --> 05:07.037
I HAVE TO GET VIDEOTAPE
FOR THE CAMERA.
 OH, I GOT SOME OLD ONES
IN THE DESK.

05:07.037 --> 05:09.540
JUST GRAB ONE.
WE'LL RECORD OVER IT.

05:17.748 --> 05:20.751
(Gabrielle) SHE'S TWO BLOCKS
AWAY. SHE'LL BE HERE ANY SECOND.

05:20.751 --> 05:22.353
GREAT. (sighs)

05:22.353 --> 05:24.324
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.326
WHY WOULD I BE NERVOUS?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.829
WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE
A TEENAGER IN THE HOUSE.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.831
WELL, I DIDN'T SAY
I WASN'T SEDATED.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.033
YEAH, I'M A LITTLE
FREAKED OUT, TOO.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.935
BUT WE'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.937
YEAH, WHEN I THINK
ABOUT EVERYTHING

05:36.937 --> 05:38.939
THAT LITTLE GIRL'S
BEEN THROUGH...

05:38.939 --> 05:41.472
(sighs) HER DAD WALKED OUT,
HER MOTHER'S IN JAIL,

05:41.472 --> 05:43.674
THE WAY SHE BOUNCED
FROM RELATIVE TO RELATIVE--

05:43.674 --> 05:47.518
I JUST WANT THIS TO BE
THE END OF THE LINE FOR HER.
 ME, TOO.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.952
MOMMY, HERE COMES THE TAXI!

05:51.952 --> 05:54.385
I WONDER IF
SHE'LL EVEN REMEMBER ME.

05:54.385 --> 05:56.857
OH, I DOUBT IT. YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN HER SINCE SHE WAS 6.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.391
YEAH, AND WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE,
I USED TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME

06:00.391 --> 06:03.033
WITH HER AND HER DAD
BEFORE HE LEFT.

06:03.033 --> 06:05.065
I REMEMBER TAKING HER
ON THE SWINGS AT THE PARK.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.067
I REMEMBER
BUYING HER ICE CREAM.
 (chuckles)

06:07.067 --> 06:10.501
I REMEMBER GIVING HER
PIGGYBACK RIDES.
 OHH.

06:21.952 --> 06:24.815
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
 (car door closes)

06:24.815 --> 06:29.420
YOU TOLD HIM
ABOUT THE DIVORCE?
 I HAD TO.
HE FOUND THE STORAGE UNIT.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.091
HE WANTED AN EXPLANATION.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.063
I WAS IN
SUCH A STATE OF SHOCK,

06:33.063 --> 06:35.395
I COULDN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.398
BREE, THIS ISN'T GOOD.
 (sighs) YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.901
NOW HE'S SAYING
IF I TRY TO DIVORCE HIM,

06:40.901 --> 06:43.434
HE CAN GO TO THE POLICE
AND REPORT ME.

06:43.434 --> 06:46.437
REPORT YOU? FOR WHAT?
 FILING A FALSE INSURANCE CLAIM.

06:46.437 --> 06:48.439
HE'S THE ONE WHO FILED IT,

06:48.439 --> 06:51.041
BUT HE'S GONNA SAY
THAT I TOLD HIM TO.

06:51.041 --> 06:54.014
OH, CRAP.
 I TOLD HIM I DON'T LOVE HIM.
HE SAID HE DOESN'T CARE.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.016
HE WANTS US
TO WORK ON OUR MARRIAGE.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.719
OH, WOW. WELL, CLEARLY,
THE GUY'S A LITTLE CRAZY.

06:58.719 --> 07:02.192
A LITTLE? THE MAN PUT CHIVES
IN MY PARISIAN SALAD!

07:02.192 --> 07:04.625
HE SHOULD BE
IN A STRAIGHTJACKET!

07:04.625 --> 07:08.529
OKAY, CALM DOWN.
THIS ISN'T THE END OF THE WORLD.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.531
ISN'T IT?

07:10.531 --> 07:13.534
I'M BEING BLACKMAILED BY A MAN
I'M STARTING TO DESPISE,

07:13.534 --> 07:15.536
AND IF I DON'T PRETEND
TO LOVE HIM,

07:15.536 --> 07:17.738
HE CAN HAVE ME ARRESTED.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.839
BREE...

07:21.041 --> 07:23.073
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT THIS.

07:23.073 --> 07:25.145
WE'RE GONNA THINK
OF SOMETHING.

07:25.145 --> 07:29.850
WHAT CAN WE THINK OF?
HE'S HOLDING ALL THE CARDS.

07:29.850 --> 07:35.125
TRUST ME. NO ONE EVER HOLDS
ALL THE CARDS.

07:43.033 --> 07:46.036
(sighing)

07:51.702 --> 07:54.705
(Tom)
LYNETTE, GET DOWN HERE!

07:54.705 --> 07:58.148
(clears throat)

07:58.148 --> 08:01.211
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE UNIVERSITY.

08:01.211 --> 08:03.083
MM-HMM?
 I'M IN!

08:03.083 --> 08:05.085
REALLY?!
YOU PASSED THE TEST?!

08:05.085 --> 08:07.087
(laughs) NOT ONLY
DID I PASS THE TEST,

08:07.087 --> 08:09.089
YOUR GENIUS HUSBAND SCORED
IN THE TOP 5%,

08:09.089 --> 08:11.021
DRUNK OUT OF HIS MIND!

08:11.021 --> 08:12.523
OH!

08:12.523 --> 08:15.966
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
I AM NOT CONDONING... EVER.

08:15.966 --> 08:17.227
CONGRATS, DAD!

08:17.227 --> 08:19.129
(laughs) THANK YOU, BABY.
MWAH!

08:19.129 --> 08:21.131
I CAN HELP YOU STUDY
IF YOU WANT.

08:21.131 --> 08:23.804
I'M NOT SURE
HOW MUCH HELP YOU'RE GONNA BE.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.105
I'M MAJORING IN CHINESE.

08:25.105 --> 08:29.279
I KNOW HOW TO SAY "TAKE ME
TO A STRIP BAR" IN MANDARIN.

08:29.279 --> 08:31.141
I'M SO PROUD.

08:31.141 --> 08:33.644
PORTER, AREN'T YOU GONNA
CONGRATULATE YOUR FATHER?

08:33.644 --> 08:36.886
CONGRATULATIONS
ON RUINING MY LIFE.

08:36.886 --> 08:38.889
IF YOU SEE ME ON CAMPUS,

08:38.889 --> 08:41.191
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO TALK TO ME.

08:41.191 --> 08:43.123
OKAY, THAT'S EVERYONE.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.697
THIS CALLS FOR
HOT FUDGE SUNDAES.

08:46.697 --> 08:49.099
EVERYBODY... IN THE CAR!

08:49.099 --> 08:51.732
OKAY. (chuckles)
OHH! MWAH!

08:51.732 --> 08:54.104
YOU COMING?
 UH, I'M GONNA MAKE
A QUICK PHONE CALL,

08:54.104 --> 08:56.106
AND I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.
 OKAY.

08:56.106 --> 08:57.167
(chuckles)

08:57.167 --> 08:58.168
(door opens)

08:58.168 --> 09:00.741
(beeping)

09:00.741 --> 09:02.012
(door closes)

09:02.012 --> 09:04.014
HI. THIS IS LYNETTE SCAVO.

09:04.014 --> 09:06.316
MAY I PLEASE SPEAK
TO DR. RUSHTON?

09:06.316 --> 09:10.020
TELL HIM IT'S IMPORTANT.

09:10.020 --> 09:12.883
HI. (clears throat)
DR. RUSHTON,

09:12.883 --> 09:16.887
I NEED TO COME IN AND SEE YOU
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

09:16.887 --> 09:19.730
I THINK THE CANCER'S BACK.

09:33.003 --> 09:35.105
MOMMY,
CAN I HAVE A JUICE BOX?

09:35.105 --> 09:37.107
OH, SWEETIE.
YOU JUST HAD ONE,

09:37.107 --> 09:39.650
AND WE DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO STOP TEN TIMES

09:39.650 --> 09:41.652
SO YOU CAN GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

09:41.652 --> 09:43.153
I MISS DIAPERS.

09:43.153 --> 09:44.985
(both laugh)

09:44.985 --> 09:47.187
OH, THE JOYS
OF BEING A PARENT.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.889
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.861
YOU DO?

09:50.861 --> 09:55.195
I HAD A LITTLE GIRL.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.697
SHE DIED.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.029
OH, MY GOD. I...

09:59.029 --> 10:02.202
I-I HAD NO IDEA.
I'M SO SORRY.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.175
THAT'S OKAY.

10:05.175 --> 10:08.338
I'M LEARNING
TO DEAL WITH IT.

10:10.941 --> 10:13.944
I CAN'T BELIEVE
EDIE GAVE YOU A KEY.
 WHY NOT? SHE TRUSTED ME.

10:13.944 --> 10:16.917
AND I ONLY USED IT WHEN I WAS
OUT OF MILK OR BREAD...

10:16.917 --> 10:19.019
(door unlocks)
 OR CASH.

10:20.851 --> 10:23.854
OKAY, LOOK FOR ANYTHING THAT
COULD TIE DAVE TO DR. HELLER.

10:23.854 --> 10:28.699
LOOK THROUGH HIS FILES,
HIS PAPERS, EVEN HIS TRASH.

10:28.699 --> 10:30.230
(bottles clink)

10:30.230 --> 10:32.232
ROBERTA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:32.232 --> 10:36.036
WE'RE TRYING TO CATCH
A MURDERER.
 I KNOW, BUT BEFORE I GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT,

10:36.036 --> 10:38.038
I'D LIKE TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.040
(whispers) OH, LOOK!
 (sets down bottle)

10:40.040 --> 10:42.743
OH! (normal voice)
MUSCLE RELAXERS--SCORE!

10:42.743 --> 10:45.245
PUT THAT BACK!
THEY'RE NOT YOURS.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.949
YEAH, APPARENTLY, THEY'RE NOT
HIS EITHER. WHO'S DAVID DASH?

10:48.949 --> 10:51.852
(knock on door)
 MR. WILLIAMS?
IT'S THE POLICE.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.224
(whispers) OH!
 (whispers) OH, CHEESE IT!

10:54.224 --> 10:56.226
WE NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

10:56.226 --> 10:58.228
(normal voice)
PLEASE TELL ME

10:58.228 --> 11:01.291
YOU DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
ILLEGAL ON YOU.
 I DO, BUT IT'S HIDDEN.

11:01.291 --> 11:05.766
AND IF THEY FIND IT,
WE GOT A LAWSUIT.
 (knock on window)

11:05.766 --> 11:06.937
LADIES?

11:06.937 --> 11:10.340
OPEN UP, PLEASE.

11:14.044 --> 11:17.247
(door opens and closes,
footsteps approaching)

11:19.980 --> 11:23.113
UH, HI THERE. CAN I HELP YOU?

11:23.113 --> 11:25.385
WELL, I HOPE SO.
ARE YOU ORSON HODGE?

11:25.385 --> 11:27.858
YES, I AM. YOU ARE...
(grunts)

11:27.858 --> 11:29.960
(groans)

11:29.960 --> 11:32.192
YOU WANT ME TO LET GO?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.995
(grunts)
 YOU WANT ME TO LET GO?

11:34.995 --> 11:37.097
YEAH.
(gasps and coughs)

11:37.097 --> 11:39.099
(pants and groans)
 THERE, I LET GO.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.301
(pants)

11:41.301 --> 11:43.703
(gags and gasps)
 (grunts)

11:43.703 --> 11:46.706
NOW YOU GOTTA DO THE SAME.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.109
OH, I THINK YOU DO,
AND I AM DEAD SERIOUS.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.742
IF YOU DON'T LET GO...
 (grunting)

11:51.742 --> 11:54.044
NEXT TIME, NEITHER WILL I.

11:54.044 --> 11:55.415
(grunts)

11:55.415 --> 11:59.890
(panting)

11:59.890 --> 12:01.191
(moans)

12:01.191 --> 12:03.193
BROUGHT YOU
A LAUNDRY BASKET.

12:03.193 --> 12:05.756
YOU NEED ME TO SHOW YOU
HOW TO USE THE WASHER?

12:07.097 --> 12:09.099
IT'S MY CLEVER WAY OF SAYING

12:09.099 --> 12:11.201
YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING
YOUR OWN LAUNDRY. (chuckles)

12:11.201 --> 12:13.433
OH. OKAY.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.366
(clears throat) YOU KNOW,
THE GIRLS HAVE CHORES, TOO.

12:16.366 --> 12:19.509
IT'S HOW WE TEACH 'EM
RESPONSIBILITY.

12:19.509 --> 12:22.272
SPEAKING OF WHICH, UH...

12:22.272 --> 12:25.315
CURFEW'S 10:00,
11:00 ON WEEKENDS.

12:25.315 --> 12:27.247
DOES THAT SEEM REASONABLE?

12:27.247 --> 12:29.079
SURE. NO PROBLEM.

12:29.079 --> 12:30.781
HMM.

12:30.781 --> 12:33.483
THIS TEENAGER THING
ISN'T SO BAD.

12:33.483 --> 12:36.056
SO WHAT ARE MY OTHER CHORES?

12:36.056 --> 12:38.058
OH, WELL,
NOT TO PUSH MY LUCK,

12:38.058 --> 12:40.360
BUT I WAS THINKING YOU COULD
SWEEP THE FRONT PORCH

12:40.360 --> 12:42.933
AND TAKE CARE
OF THE GUEST BATHROOM.

12:42.933 --> 12:46.166
YOU GOT IT.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.869
OH, THAT'S A PRETTY DRESS.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.372
OH, MY GOD, IT'S VERSACE!

12:52.372 --> 12:54.905
YEAH. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

12:54.905 --> 12:58.909
"ALL RIGHT"? YOUNG LADY,
IF YOU LIVE UNDER MY ROOF,

12:58.909 --> 13:00.981
YOU WILL NOT
 DISPARAGE VERSACE.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.552
SORRY.

13:02.552 --> 13:05.155
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.
(chuckles) IT WAS A JOKE.

13:05.155 --> 13:07.988
OH. FUNNY.

13:07.988 --> 13:11.561
WELL, I GUESS I'M GONNA
GET STARTED ON MY LAUNDRY.

13:11.561 --> 13:13.824
VERA WANG!

13:13.824 --> 13:16.827
(gasps) WHERE ARE YOU GETTING
ALL THESE DRESSES?

13:16.827 --> 13:18.298
THEY WERE GIFTS.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.100
YOU KNOW, FROM BOYFRIENDS.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.933
BOYFRIENDS?
 HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE?

13:22.933 --> 13:26.006
NOT AS MANY AS I USED TO.
I HAD TO MAKE SOME CUTBACKS.

13:26.006 --> 13:30.240
YEAH, THE ECONOMY
HAS HIT US ALL.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.982
SO...

13:31.982 --> 13:35.215
WHAT KIND OF BOYFRIENDS
 CAN AFFORD THINGS LIKE THIS?

13:35.215 --> 13:36.887
THEY'RE COLLEGE GUYS

13:36.887 --> 13:39.119
WITH RICH PARENTS
WHO CAN PAY FOR EVERYTHING.

13:39.119 --> 13:43.123
UH-HUH. AND SO... THEY GIVE YOU
DESIGNER CLOTHES,

13:43.123 --> 13:45.595
AND YOU GIVE THEM...

13:45.595 --> 13:47.827
THE PLEASURE OF MY COMPANY.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.599
YEAH. (chuckles)
OKAY, WELL...

13:49.599 --> 13:51.601
DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

13:51.601 --> 13:54.264
BUT THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
FROM THE VERSACE VIRGIN LINE.

13:54.264 --> 13:56.266
I DON'T HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING.

13:56.266 --> 13:58.608
THEY JUST HAVE TO THINK
 I MIGHT.

13:58.608 --> 14:02.272
UH-HUH, AND HOW LONG
DO YOU THINK THAT WILL LAST?

14:02.272 --> 14:05.515
TILL 10:00,
11:00 ON THE WEEKENDS.

14:07.177 --> 14:10.050
JUST KIDDING.
IT WAS A JOKE.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.422
OH.

14:12.422 --> 14:14.424
FUNNY.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.365
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:30.540 --> 14:32.542
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SHIRT?

14:32.542 --> 14:35.405
WHY DON'T YOU ASK
YOUR FRIEND?

14:35.405 --> 14:37.978
THE ONE YOU HIRED
TO ASSAULT ME.

14:37.978 --> 14:41.051
YOU WERE ASSAULTED?

14:41.051 --> 14:43.013
HE, UH...

14:43.013 --> 14:45.315
GRABBED ME BY THE THROAT,
THREW ME TO THE GROUND

14:45.315 --> 14:47.317
AND TOLD ME TO "LET GO."

14:47.317 --> 14:50.220
YOUR MESSAGE CAME THROUGH
LOUD AND CLEAR.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.492
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.325
OH, PLEASE.

14:55.325 --> 14:57.968
WHO ELSE WOULD HAVE DONE IT?

15:00.570 --> 15:02.272
I DON'T KNOW.

15:02.272 --> 15:04.574
BUT I SWEAR TO YOU,
WE MAY HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES,

15:04.574 --> 15:09.139
BUT I WOULD NEVER
HIRE SOMEONE TO ATTACK YOU.

15:09.139 --> 15:11.982
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

15:15.245 --> 15:18.588
I DO.

15:18.588 --> 15:20.290
FORGIVE ME.

15:20.290 --> 15:22.592
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
YOU COULD NEVER HURT ME.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.296
(sighs)

15:26.296 --> 15:27.427
I'LL STAY.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.259
WHAT?

15:29.259 --> 15:32.632
ONCE I'VE UNPACKED, I'LL BRING
YOU MY SHIRT SO YOU CAN MEND IT.

15:51.221 --> 15:54.224
WE'RE JUST RUNNING TO THE STORE,
ANA. WE'LL BE BACK IN A BIT.

15:54.224 --> 15:57.157
OKAY. I'LL SWEEP THE PORCH
WHILE YOU'RE GONE.
 AND IF YOU DON'T MIND,

15:57.157 --> 15:59.489
WILL YOU MAKE SURE JUANITA
AND CELIA DO THEIR CHORES, TOO?

15:59.489 --> 16:00.690
SURE THING.

16:13.343 --> 16:16.006
(sighs) I GOT THE REST, BABE.

16:16.006 --> 16:18.748
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE.

16:18.748 --> 16:21.351
(door closes)

16:21.351 --> 16:23.553
OH, YOU'RE BACK.

16:23.553 --> 16:26.656
OH, MY GOD.

16:26.656 --> 16:29.159
ANA, THE HOUSE IS SO CLEAN.

16:29.159 --> 16:31.091
JUST WANTED TO DO MY PART.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.393
WELL, HOW DID YOU GET
EVERYTHING DOWN SO QUICKLY?

16:33.393 --> 16:35.225
WELL...
 (footsteps approaching)

16:38.468 --> 16:41.771
WE FINISHED UPSTAIRS, ANA.
 ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED DONE?

16:43.533 --> 16:46.536
THEY WANTED TO HANG OUT,
BUT I HAD CHORES TO DO,

16:46.536 --> 16:48.608
SO THEY INSISTED
ON HELPING ME.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.280
AREN'T THEY SWEET?

16:50.280 --> 16:55.145
HEY, UM, I'M NOT BRAGGING
AND I DON'T RECOMMEND IT,

16:55.145 --> 16:58.688
BUT YOU COULD SO EAT
OUT OF YOUR DOWNSTAIRS TOILET.

16:58.688 --> 17:01.251
OKAY, BOYS,
THANKS FOR YOUR HARD WORK,

17:01.251 --> 17:04.253
BUT MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GO HOME
AND TAKE A SHOWER...

17:04.253 --> 17:06.256
PREFERABLY A COLD ONE.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.130
BYE, PRESTON.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.601
I'M PORTER.
 I'M PRESTON.

17:11.601 --> 17:14.604
OH, YOU CAN CALL ME
WHATEVER YOU WANT.
 ALL RIGHT.

17:16.366 --> 17:18.808
MOMMY, IT WAS SO COOL.

17:18.808 --> 17:21.711
ANA GOT THE BOYS
TO DO MY CHORES, TOO.

17:21.711 --> 17:24.444
DID SHE?

17:24.444 --> 17:27.676
I WANNA LEARN HOW TO MAKE BOYS
DO STUFF. CAN YOU TEACH ME?

17:27.676 --> 17:29.679
UH, OKAY, JUANITA,
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

17:29.679 --> 17:32.282
AND DON'T COME OUT
UNTIL YOU'RE 18.

17:32.282 --> 17:34.324
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

17:34.324 --> 17:38.188
ANA, THE WHOLE POINT OF CHORES
IS THAT YOU DO THEM.

17:38.188 --> 17:41.191
YOU DON'T BAT YOUR EYES
AND CALL RENT-A-HORNY-KID.

17:41.191 --> 17:44.494
THE HOUSE IS CLEAN. WHAT DO YOU
CARE HOW IT GOT THAT WAY?

17:44.494 --> 17:47.497
I CARE ABOUT THE MESSAGE
IT SENDS TO MY LITTLE GIRLS,

17:47.497 --> 17:51.201
AND I'M STARTING TO CARE
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR TONE.
 OH, I'M SORRY.

17:51.201 --> 17:54.374
HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR
HOUSEKEEPERS TO SPEAK TO YOU?

17:54.374 --> 17:59.249
(scoffs) AND THE TEENAGER
HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.

17:59.249 --> 18:00.780
ANA, LISTEN.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.782
WE WANT YOU TO BE
PART OF THIS FAMILY.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.785
WE WILL LOVE YOU AND SUPPORT YOU
AND TAKE CARE OF YOU,

18:05.785 --> 18:07.457
BUT IN EXCHANGE,

18:07.457 --> 18:10.460
YOU WILL SHOW US A LITTLE BIT
OF RESPECT AND OBEY OUR RULES,

18:10.460 --> 18:12.462
WHICH MEANS
DOING YOUR OWN CHORES,

18:12.462 --> 18:15.825
NO BOYS IN THE HOUSE
AND NO MORE GIFTS FROM MEN.

18:20.670 --> 18:22.472
I GET IT NOW.

18:22.472 --> 18:24.334
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

18:24.334 --> 18:26.706
OF WHAT?

18:26.706 --> 18:28.238
OF ME.

18:28.238 --> 18:29.709
YOU'RE NOT YOUNG ANYMORE.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.711
YOU CAN'T GET GUYS
TO DO THINGS FOR YOU,

18:31.711 --> 18:33.883
AND THAT DRIVES YOU CRAZY.

18:33.883 --> 18:35.645
(laughs)

18:35.645 --> 18:37.317
YOU WANNA SEE CRAZY?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.319
MAKE ONE MORE STATEMENT
LIKE THAT,

18:39.319 --> 18:42.322
AND I AM THROWING YOUR ASS
OUT ON THE STREET.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.324
YOU CARE TO TEST ME?

18:49.859 --> 18:52.262
(scoffs)

19:01.671 --> 19:04.344
(crying)

19:04.344 --> 19:07.317
ANA? WHAT'S WRONG?

19:07.317 --> 19:11.751
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID.
SHE WANTS TO KICK ME OUT.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.753
(crying)

19:13.753 --> 19:16.456
SO SHE HAD A COUPLE BOYS
COME OVER AND DO HER CHORES.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.458
YOU'VE BEEN DOING STUFF
LIKE THAT YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

19:18.458 --> 19:22.462
THAT'S NOT THE POINT! YOU DIDN'T
HEAR THE WAY SHE TALKED TO ME!
 I DON'T CARE!

19:22.462 --> 19:26.165
YOU DON'T TELL A KID WHO'S BEEN
BOUNCED AROUND HER WHOLE LIFE

19:26.165 --> 19:29.168
THAT YOU'RE GONNA
THROW HER OUT ON THE STREET!
 I DIDN'T TELL HER THAT!

19:29.168 --> 19:31.301
I JUST...
KIND OF THREATENED TO.

19:31.301 --> 19:34.704
BOTTOM LINE--SHE IS MY NIECE,
AND SHE IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

19:34.704 --> 19:37.407
YOU'RE THE ADULT, GABY.
START ACTING LIKE IT.

19:37.407 --> 19:39.509
(stammers)

19:39.509 --> 19:41.180
(scoffs)

19:41.180 --> 19:42.312
(door slams)

19:49.619 --> 19:51.621
I KNOW THIS LOOKS BAD,

19:51.621 --> 19:54.224
BUT WE DID WHAT WE DID
FOR A GOOD REASON.

19:54.224 --> 19:56.796
MA'AM, YOU CAN'T BREAK INTO
A PERSON'S HOUSE FOR ANY REASON.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.669
UH, WHAT IF THERE'S A BABY
INSIDE AND THERE'S A FIRE?

19:59.669 --> 20:01.331
WELL...

20:01.331 --> 20:04.234
SEE? EVERYTHING'S NOT
ALL CUT AND DRY, IS IT, ROOKIE?

20:04.234 --> 20:06.236
ROBERTA, DON'T PISS HIM OFF.

20:06.236 --> 20:09.339
YOU CAN'T TAKE A CLUB
TO THE HEAD LIKE YOU USED TO.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.883
OKAY, I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH HELLER'S SECRETARY.

20:13.883 --> 20:16.416
DAVID DASH WAS DEFINITELY
A PATIENT THERE.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.489
(Collins) WELL, THAT'S WHY
WE COULDN'T MAKE THE MATCH.
 MM-HMM.

20:19.489 --> 20:21.491
HE CHANGED HIS LAST NAME.
 MM-HMM, AND GET THIS.

20:21.491 --> 20:23.493
HE'S THE SAME GUY
WHOSE WIFE AND DAUGHTER

20:23.493 --> 20:26.326
WERE KILLED IN THAT CAR CRASH
UP ON CANTERBURY ROAD.
 (Karen gasps) CANTERBURY ROAD!

20:26.326 --> 20:27.997
I REMEMBER THAT ACCIDENT.

20:27.997 --> 20:31.401
MY NEIGHBORS MIKE AND SUSAN
WERE IN THE CAR THAT HIT 'EM.

20:31.401 --> 20:33.403
OH, WAIT. NOW WAIT.
OKAY, THAT'S WEIRD.

20:33.403 --> 20:35.405
I MEAN, WHY WOULD DAVE
MOVE ONTO THE SAME STREET

20:35.405 --> 20:37.407
AS THE PEOPLE
WHO KILLED HIS FAMILY?

20:43.273 --> 20:46.576
THE DOCTOR HAS YOUR RESULTS.
HE'LL BE HERE IN A MINUTE.

20:49.379 --> 20:51.621
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE?

20:51.621 --> 20:54.984
YOU'LL NEED TO TALK
TO THE DOCTOR ABOUT THAT.

20:54.984 --> 20:58.858
COME ON. I KNOW YOU KNOW.
IT'S CANCER AGAIN. AM I RIGHT?

20:58.858 --> 21:00.590
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

21:00.590 --> 21:03.833
NOW PLEASE,
HE'LL JUST BE A MOMENT.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.935
IF IT'S CANCER,
AND I FIND OUT YOU KNEW,

21:05.935 --> 21:07.937
I WON'T BE DYING ALONE.

21:12.842 --> 21:14.374
HELLO, LYNETTE.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.505
HI.

21:15.505 --> 21:18.508
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU CAME IN.
WE GOT THE RESULTS BACK,

21:18.508 --> 21:20.550
AND THE TEST
DID PICK SOMETHING UP.

21:20.550 --> 21:22.552
SO IT IS THE CANCER.

21:22.552 --> 21:25.885
(voice breaks) OH, GOD,
I CAN'T GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN!

21:25.885 --> 21:28.318
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

21:28.318 --> 21:30.660
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.463
EXCUSE ME?

21:33.463 --> 21:35.395
ABOUT SIX WEEKS OR SO.

21:38.468 --> 21:42.572
ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT CANCER?

21:50.740 --> 21:52.412
(laughs) OKAY, SUSAN.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.415
BUT WHEN YOU'RE OUT ON THE BOAT,
MAKE SURE YOU PUT ON SUNSCREEN.

21:55.415 --> 21:58.418
AND ON YOUR FEET, TOO.
REMEMBER OUR TRIP TO MEXICO?

21:58.418 --> 22:00.089
(laughs)

22:00.089 --> 22:02.992
OKAY, I'LL TALK
TO YOU GUYS LATER.

22:04.494 --> 22:06.356
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

22:06.356 --> 22:08.958
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT.

22:08.958 --> 22:10.099
HMM.

22:12.362 --> 22:14.364
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA DO THIS?

22:14.364 --> 22:16.335
DO WHAT?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.337
GO TO VEGAS, GET MARRIED.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.340
I MEAN, IT IS A WHOLE WEEKEND
AWAY FROM SUSAN.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.342
(sighs)
KATHERINE, I TOLD YOU.

22:23.342 --> 22:27.877
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
M.J. WAS OKAY.
 (scoffs) WHY DON'T YOU
JUST ADMIT IT?

22:27.877 --> 22:31.381
YOU'RE STILL HUNG UP ON HER.
 OH, FOR GOD SAKE,
ARE WE GONNA DO THIS AGAIN?

22:31.381 --> 22:33.483
ALL I KNOW IS,
IT'S OUR WEDDING DAY,

22:33.483 --> 22:35.485
AND YOU WERE
IN A CRAPPY MOOD

22:35.485 --> 22:38.428
UNTIL YOU TALKED
TO YOUR EX-WIFE.

22:38.428 --> 22:40.430
KATHERINE,
I WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE

22:40.430 --> 22:44.093
IF I DIDN'T WANT
TO MARRY YOU. OKAY?

22:44.093 --> 22:45.395
REALLY?

22:45.395 --> 22:46.736
REALLY.

22:46.736 --> 22:49.999
DO I NEED TO SHOUT IT OUT
IN THE AIRPORT?

22:49.999 --> 22:52.371
YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT.
 OH, I WILL.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.975
I'LL--I'LL DO WHATEVER
I NEED TO, TO PROVE MY LOVE!
 (laughing) NO, IT'S OKAY!

22:55.975 --> 22:57.807
YOU CONVINCED ME.

22:57.807 --> 23:00.379
(kisses)

23:00.379 --> 23:04.113
I AM DYING FOR A CAPPUCCINO.
YOU WANT ONE?

23:04.113 --> 23:05.515
(click)

23:05.515 --> 23:07.016
YEAH, I DO.

23:07.016 --> 23:09.659
YOU SAID IT. "I DO."

23:09.659 --> 23:12.622
(laughs)
 CAN'T TAKE IT BACK NOW.

23:12.622 --> 23:14.063
(chuckles)

23:14.063 --> 23:16.426
(Dave) ...SHOULD BE ALLOWED
TO JUST... WALK AWAY.

23:16.426 --> 23:19.128
I KNOW SOME PEOPLE
WILL WONDER,

23:19.128 --> 23:23.673
WHY DIDN'T I JUST KILL SUSAN?

23:23.673 --> 23:26.436
BUT WHAT GOOD
WOULD THAT HAVE DONE?

23:26.436 --> 23:29.739
SHE'D BE DEAD.
THERE'D BE NO... SUFFERING.

23:29.739 --> 23:31.741
AND TO THOSE OF YOU WHO HATE ME

23:31.741 --> 23:34.614
BECAUSE I TOOK THE LIFE
OF AN INNOCENT, YOUNG BOY,

23:34.614 --> 23:36.616
I SAY...

23:36.616 --> 23:39.048
(sighs)

23:39.048 --> 23:42.091
KATHERINE!

23:42.091 --> 23:43.593
EXCUSE ME.
 MM-HMM?

23:43.593 --> 23:47.126
THAT WOMAN I WAS WITH? TELL HER
I HAD TO GO. IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

23:47.126 --> 23:50.129
(murmuring)

23:59.008 --> 24:02.812
OH, UH, YOUR FRIEND ASKED ME
TO TELL YOU HE HAD TO LEAVE.

24:02.812 --> 24:04.974
WHAT?

24:04.974 --> 24:07.647
HE SAID TO SAY HE'S SORRY.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.162
(door slams shut)

24:23.162 --> 24:26.165
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
 FIRST, TELL ME IF IT WORKED,

24:26.165 --> 24:28.698
THEN I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

24:28.698 --> 24:32.201
DON'T BE GLIB. DID YOU HIRE
SOMEONE TO ATTACK ORSON?

24:32.201 --> 24:33.543
YES.

24:33.543 --> 24:36.205
ARE YOU INSANE?
YOUR THUG TRIED TO STRANGLE HIM.

24:36.205 --> 24:38.878
IF HE HAD TRIED
TO STRANGLE HIM, HE'D BE DEAD.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.150
LOOK, ORSON HAD THE UPPER HAND
IN THIS DIVORCE.

24:41.150 --> 24:44.153
WE NEEDED TO REGAIN IT.
 NOT BY RESORTING
TO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE.

24:44.153 --> 24:48.518
I WOULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN
MY PERMISSION FOR THAT.
 THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T ASK YOU.

24:50.219 --> 24:51.921
W-WHAT'S YOUR BEEF HERE,
BREE?

24:51.921 --> 24:54.924
MY BEEF IS THAT FROM THE MINUTE
I WALKED INTO THIS OFFICE,

24:54.924 --> 24:56.996
YOU HAVE PULLED ME
DEEPER AND DEEPER

24:56.996 --> 24:59.999
INTO YOUR MORAL CESSPOOL.
THAT IS NOT WHY I HIRED YOU.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.832
PLEASE. THAT IS EXACTLY
 WHY YOU HIRED ME.

25:02.832 --> 25:05.835
FACE IT. YOU WERE TIRED
OF BEING A GOOD GIRL.

25:05.835 --> 25:08.538
YOU KNEW IT WAS TIME
TO PLAY DIRTY.

25:08.538 --> 25:10.840
I WANTED TO PROTECT
WHAT WAS MINE.

25:10.840 --> 25:14.183
YOU HAVE TURNED ME INTO SOMEONE
I DON'T RECOGNIZE.
 AND YOU'VE LOVED
EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

25:14.183 --> 25:16.686
NO, I HAVEN'T.
 YES, YOU HAVE!

25:16.686 --> 25:19.789
AND SO HAVE I.

25:19.789 --> 25:22.291
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS,

25:22.291 --> 25:24.754
I THINK YOU'RE
THE MOST FASCINATING WOMAN

25:24.754 --> 25:26.826
THAT I HAVE EVER MET.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.028
WHAT?

25:32.231 --> 25:34.103
KARL... (chuckles nervously)

25:34.103 --> 25:37.106
IF I HAVE NOT BEEN CLEAR
ABOUT HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU,

25:37.106 --> 25:39.108
I APOLOGIZE
FOR ANY AMBIGUITY.

25:39.108 --> 25:42.311
UNDERSTAND THIS--
I DETEST YOU.

25:42.311 --> 25:46.075
NO, YOU DON'T.
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.

25:46.075 --> 25:49.078
YOU WANT ME TO WALK OVER THERE
AND PULL YOU UP AGAINST ME

25:49.078 --> 25:52.121
AND KISS YOU
UNTIL YOUR KNEES BUCKLE.

25:52.121 --> 25:54.183
YOU'RE FIRED.

25:54.183 --> 25:58.027
GOOD. THAT KEEPS THIS FROM
BEING A BREACH OF ETHICS.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.665
MMM.

26:10.770 --> 26:13.572
(whispers) MY KNEES
HAVEN'T BUCKLED YET.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.285

 DO NOT REACT

26:42.071 --> 26:45.034
to what I'm about to tell you.
 WOW.

26:45.034 --> 26:48.607
This sounds really--
 SUSAN! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.279
OKAY.

26:50.279 --> 26:54.213

 OKAY.

AH, WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
LET'S KEEP GOING.

28:09.719 --> 28:11.390
AREN'T YOU HUNGRY, THOUGH?

28:11.390 --> 28:13.993
MAYBE THERE'S A RESTAURANT
UP AHEAD.

28:13.993 --> 28:17.466
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO STOP, SUSAN.

28:17.466 --> 28:18.998

I GOT PENS. I GOT NOTEBOOKS.

28:43.893 --> 28:45.895
OOH, I GOT AN ENGLISH

28:47.356 --> 28:50.299

28:50.299 --> 28:53.202
OH, AND LOOK AT THIS.

28:53.202 --> 28:54.964
CHECK IT OUT.

28:54.964 --> 28:57.306
THEY'RE SCENTED.
YOU WANNA SMELL GRAPE?

28:59.168 --> 29:02.041

29:02.041 --> 29:03.112

29:03.112 --> 29:05.374
I WENT TO THE DOCTOR TODAY.

29:05.374 --> 29:07.176
(sets down purse)

29:07.176 --> 29:09.018
WHAT'S WRONG?

29:09.018 --> 29:11.480
I'M PREGNANT.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.824
PREGNANT?

29:14.824 --> 29:16.285
WITH A BABY?

29:16.285 --> 29:18.988
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
SNIFFING THOSE MARKERS?

29:18.988 --> 29:20.990
OF COURSE WITH A BABY.

29:20.990 --> 29:23.432
BUT YOU CAN'T.
I MEAN... W-WE CAN'T.

29:23.432 --> 29:25.294
W-WE'RE OLD!

29:25.294 --> 29:27.496
WELL, APPARENTLY,
NOT OLD ENOUGH.

29:29.999 --> 29:32.301
(sighs)

29:32.301 --> 29:35.304
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
ABOUT SCHOOL?

29:35.304 --> 29:38.407
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
ABOUT MY JOB?

29:38.407 --> 29:40.409
(sets down pens)

29:43.312 --> 29:46.355
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
ANOTHER BABY.

29:46.355 --> 29:51.060
ACTUALLY, I HAVE
AN ADDENDUM TO THAT.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.995
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE ABOUT
TO RECITE THE GIRL SCOUT OATH.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.566
NO, TOM.

29:57.566 --> 30:00.900
WE'RE HAVING TWINS...

30:00.900 --> 30:02.902
AGAIN.

30:06.175 --> 30:09.408
(cries softly)

30:11.310 --> 30:13.883
I HAVE TO GO POTTY.

30:13.883 --> 30:15.214
OKAY, SWEETIE.

30:15.214 --> 30:18.217
DO YOU MIND PULLING OVER
AT THE NEXT REST STOP?

30:18.217 --> 30:21.951
WE'RE ALMOST THERE, BUDDY.
CAN YOU HOLD IT?
 NO. I REALLY HAVE TO GO.

30:26.295 --> 30:28.527
FINE.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.960
JUST HOLD ON
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

30:32.831 --> 30:36.335
OH. UM...

30:36.335 --> 30:37.366
HERE?

30:37.366 --> 30:39.408
HE--HE CAN'T GO HERE.

30:39.408 --> 30:40.910
(car door closes)

30:40.910 --> 30:42.912
(grunts) COME ON, M.J.
LET'S GO.

30:42.912 --> 30:45.514
UM, CAN'T WE FIND A GAS STATION
OR MAYBE A DINER?

30:45.514 --> 30:47.516
HE'S A BIG BOY.
HE CAN USE THE BUSHES.

30:47.516 --> 30:50.319
OKAY. HERE, M.J.
WAIT FOR ME.
 DON'T GO TOO FAR.

30:50.319 --> 30:52.621
(cell phone rings)

30:52.621 --> 30:54.984
(ring, beep)
 HELLO?

30:54.984 --> 30:57.626
Dave, Detective Collins
with the Fairview P.D.

30:57.626 --> 30:59.288
We know everything.

30:59.288 --> 31:03.262
I-I'M SORRY. WHAT ARE YOU--
 Heller, your wife, your child.
All of it.

31:03.262 --> 31:06.265
If you come in now, I'll do
everything I can to help you.

31:06.265 --> 31:09.268
But let's end this
before someone gets hurt.
 (grunts)

31:09.268 --> 31:10.339
(thud)
 (pants)

31:15.104 --> 31:16.405
(whispers) KEYS.

31:16.405 --> 31:19.148
KEYS... OH.

31:32.421 --> 31:34.623
AAH!

31:34.623 --> 31:36.895
AAH! M.J., RUN!

31:36.895 --> 31:39.398
COME ON, HONEY!
LET'S RUN! LET'S RUN!

31:39.398 --> 31:41.600
WHY ARE WE RUNNING?

31:41.600 --> 31:43.602
WE'RE PLAYING A GAME
WITH DAVE, OKAY?

31:43.602 --> 31:47.306
SO RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN.
OW! OW! (groans)

31:47.306 --> 31:49.308
ARE YOU OKAY?

31:49.308 --> 31:51.680
AAH! OW! (exhales sharply)
I'M FINE.

31:51.680 --> 31:54.283
(Dave) SUSAN! M.J.!

31:54.283 --> 31:55.584
(panting) OKAY, LISTEN.

31:55.584 --> 31:57.686
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT YOU WIN THIS GAME.

31:57.686 --> 31:59.989
SO I WANT YOU TO FIND
A GOOD HIDING PLACE,

31:59.989 --> 32:02.051
AND EVEN IF YOU HEAR DAVE,

32:02.051 --> 32:05.224
YOU DON'T COME OUT NO MATTER
WHAT, OKAY? OKAY? (sighs)

32:05.224 --> 32:08.297
DON'T WORRY.
I'M GONNA HIDE, TOO. NOW GO.

32:08.297 --> 32:09.498
GO!

32:09.498 --> 32:11.530
OW. (grunts)

32:11.530 --> 32:13.532
(cries)

32:15.134 --> 32:18.467
WHERE IS HE?

32:18.467 --> 32:20.709
(panting)

32:20.709 --> 32:23.212
YOU ARE NOT GONNA
MESS THIS UP!

32:23.212 --> 32:26.215
AAH! AAH!
 WE ARE TOO CLOSE
TO THE FINISH LINE!

32:26.215 --> 32:29.678
NOW CALL HIM!

32:29.678 --> 32:32.451
CALL HIM.

32:34.583 --> 32:37.056
M.J.!

32:38.457 --> 32:40.529
DON'T COME OUT! (grunts)

32:40.529 --> 32:42.231
(thud)

32:48.067 --> 32:50.339
M.J.!

32:50.339 --> 32:53.502
YOU WANNA GO FISHING,
DON'T YOU, BUDDY?

32:53.502 --> 32:56.505
WELL, IF YOU DON'T COME OUT NOW,
WE'RE GONNA GET THERE TOO LATE!

32:56.505 --> 32:59.608
(singsongy)
I'LL LET YOU DRIVE THE BOAT!

33:03.552 --> 33:07.416
(normal voice) OKAY,
IF YOU DON'T COME OUT RIGHT NOW,

33:07.416 --> 33:11.090
WE'RE GONNA LEAVE
WITHOUT YOU.

33:11.090 --> 33:14.723
YOU DON'T WANNA BE IN THIS SCARY
GRAVEYARD AFTER DARK, DO YA?

33:18.597 --> 33:21.270
ALL RIGHT, M.J.,

33:21.270 --> 33:23.272
WE'RE LEAVING!

33:43.692 --> 33:48.557
MOMMY, WAKE UP.
I GET TO DRIVE THE BOAT.

33:57.366 --> 34:00.309
NOW KEEP THE VOLUME
REALLY HIGH.

34:00.309 --> 34:03.112
YOU DON'T WANNA HEAR
ALL THE BORING GROWN-UP TALK.

34:04.613 --> 34:08.717
(groans and pants)

34:08.717 --> 34:12.451
BUCKLE UP.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.523
(fastens seat belt)

34:14.523 --> 34:17.556
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TO US?

34:17.556 --> 34:19.788
SHUT UP.
I'M TRYING TO THINK.

34:19.788 --> 34:22.231
(shifts gears)

34:28.237 --> 34:30.469
DAVE, PLEASE...

34:30.469 --> 34:34.503
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT THAT ACCIDENT.

34:36.105 --> 34:38.407
YOU DON'T WANNA
HURT M.J. OR ME.

34:38.407 --> 34:42.351
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.
I KNOW YOU.
 DON'T ANALYZE ME.

34:42.351 --> 34:45.484
THE LAST GUY WHO TRIED THAT
DIDN'T DO SO WELL.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.418
WELL, YOU WON'T
GET AWAY WITH IT.

34:50.418 --> 34:53.822
MIKE ALREADY CALLED THE COPS.
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.
 ENOUGH!

34:53.822 --> 34:55.524
(cell phone rings)

34:55.524 --> 34:58.127
(ring)

34:58.127 --> 35:00.129
(ring)

35:00.129 --> 35:01.630
(beep)

35:01.630 --> 35:03.632
SUSAN? WHERE ARE YOU?

35:03.632 --> 35:05.804
(Dave) Not up at the lake.

35:05.804 --> 35:08.577
YOU KIND OF SCREWED UP
MY PLANS HERE, MIKE.
 MIKE!

35:08.577 --> 35:10.309
(grunts)

35:10.309 --> 35:13.142
OH, AND, UH,
SUSAN SAYS HELLO.

35:13.142 --> 35:16.445
OKAY, DAVE, TAKE IT EASY.

35:16.445 --> 35:18.487
YOU WANT REVENGE?

35:18.487 --> 35:21.150
LET SUSAN AND M.J. GO.
TAKE ME INSTEAD.

35:21.150 --> 35:22.421
(sighs)

35:22.421 --> 35:24.423
HOW DOES IT FEEL, MIKE,

35:24.423 --> 35:28.157
TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T SAVE
THE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE?

35:28.157 --> 35:29.898
HOPELESS?

35:29.898 --> 35:33.162
LIKE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
HAS NO MEANING?

35:33.162 --> 35:36.505
DAVE, PLEASE.

35:36.505 --> 35:39.508
I-I CAN'T BE THAT FAR
BEHIND YOU. I'M ON ROUTE 12.

35:39.508 --> 35:42.441
YOU'RE ON ROUTE 12?

35:42.441 --> 35:44.873
Yeah. Yeah, come on.

35:44.873 --> 35:48.477
YOU DON'T WANNA HURT THEM.
LET ME BE THE ONE.

35:48.477 --> 35:51.750
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE.

35:51.750 --> 35:54.523
SO WE'VE GOT A DEAL?

35:54.523 --> 35:58.887
IF I SEE ONE COP CAR,
THEY'RE BOTH DEAD.

35:58.887 --> 36:02.491
NO COPS. YOU JUST TELL ME
WHERE TO MEET YOU.

36:02.491 --> 36:04.363
KEEP HEADING SOUTH.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.335
THERE'S
AN ABANDONED GAS STATION

36:06.335 --> 36:08.637
PAST THE INTERSECTION
OF ROUTE 12 AND CANTERBURY ROAD.

36:08.637 --> 36:10.499
(beep)

36:10.499 --> 36:12.441
CANTERBURY ROAD?
THAT'S WHERE WE...

36:12.441 --> 36:14.403
YEAH, IT IS.

36:20.509 --> 36:22.651
(turns off engine)

36:24.713 --> 36:28.557
LOOK FAMILIAR?

36:28.557 --> 36:31.790
(sniffles) WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO TO US?

36:31.790 --> 36:33.862
WHY DID YOU BRING US HERE?

36:33.862 --> 36:37.396
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE POETIC.

36:37.396 --> 36:40.729
MIKE SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

36:40.729 --> 36:43.572
DAVE, PLEASE.
DON'T HURT MIKE.

36:43.572 --> 36:45.234
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT.

36:45.234 --> 36:49.638
NO. IT WAS YOUR FAULT.

36:49.638 --> 36:52.441
BUT HE WANTS
TO BE THE HERO, SO...

36:54.583 --> 36:57.486
GET OUT.
 (unfastens seat belt)

36:57.486 --> 37:00.519
I'M NOT LEAVING M.J.

37:00.519 --> 37:04.423
M.J.'s COMING. I NEED
TO SET YOU UP FIRST. GET OUT.

37:04.423 --> 37:07.225
(whispers) NOW.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.459
(cries)

37:10.459 --> 37:14.603
(voice breaks) TRY NOT TO SCARE
M.J. WHEN YOU BRING HIM HERE.

37:14.603 --> 37:17.306
ACTUALLY, CHANGE OF PLANS.
(grunts)

37:17.306 --> 37:18.607
WHAT?

37:18.607 --> 37:20.909
M.J.'s STAYING WITH ME.

37:20.909 --> 37:23.612
HE AND I ARE GONNA
PULL INTO THAT INTERSECTION

37:23.612 --> 37:27.316
JUST AS MIKE COMES
BARRELING DOWN THAT ROAD.

37:27.316 --> 37:29.278
OH, MY GOD.

37:29.278 --> 37:31.580
AND YOU'RE GONNA
STAY THERE AND WATCH

37:31.580 --> 37:33.882
AS MIKE KILLS YOUR CHILD,

37:33.882 --> 37:35.884
JUST LIKE YOU KILLED MINE.

37:37.626 --> 37:40.459
I TOLD YOU IT WAS POETIC.

37:40.459 --> 37:42.491
DAVE, PLEASE. PLEASE.

37:42.491 --> 37:44.493
I CANNOT IMAGINE
THE PAIN YOU WENT THROUGH,

37:44.493 --> 37:47.496
BUT YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
YOU CAN'T KILL MY LITTLE BOY!

37:47.496 --> 37:49.768
SHUT UP.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.941
WHAT IF YOUR DAUGHTER
COULD SEE YOU NOW?!

37:52.941 --> 37:55.544
IS THIS HOW
YOU'D WANT HER TO SEE YOU?!

37:55.544 --> 37:59.548
AS A MONSTER WHO COULD MURDER
AN INNOCENT CHILD?!

38:01.550 --> 38:04.513
I'M NOT A MONSTER.

38:04.513 --> 38:07.356
DAVE! DAVE!

38:13.622 --> 38:17.696
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.

38:17.696 --> 38:21.430
YOU'RE A BIG BOY NOW.

38:21.430 --> 38:23.572
(sighs)

38:28.036 --> 38:29.538
(gasps)

38:33.482 --> 38:34.643
(gasps)

38:42.821 --> 38:45.654
AAH!

38:45.654 --> 38:47.826
AAH!

38:50.529 --> 38:52.731
MIKE!

38:54.463 --> 38:56.965
MIKE! MIKE!

38:56.965 --> 38:58.467
STOP!

38:59.568 --> 39:01.470
(tires peal, engine revs)

39:01.470 --> 39:02.711
NO!
 (horn honks)

39:02.711 --> 39:05.374
(brakes screech)

39:07.446 --> 39:10.419
(sobbing) M.J.!

39:10.419 --> 39:13.422
(hissing)

39:18.657 --> 39:20.358
M.J.!

39:20.358 --> 39:23.632
MAMA!

39:23.632 --> 39:25.934
OH, GOD! ARE YOU OKAY?

39:25.934 --> 39:28.637
DAVE TOLD ME
TO GET OUT OF THE CAR.

39:28.637 --> 39:31.640
(sobs) OH!

39:31.640 --> 39:32.601
(whispers) MIKE.

39:36.505 --> 39:38.847
MIKE!

39:42.511 --> 39:44.583
DADDY!

40:09.578 --> 40:12.981
(Lila) SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE ALL GO OUT FOR ICE CREAM?

40:12.981 --> 40:15.744
OH, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I BROUGHT WORK HOME.

40:15.744 --> 40:17.145
AGAIN?

40:17.145 --> 40:19.187
I KNOW. I'M SO BORING.

40:19.187 --> 40:21.820
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TWO GO?

40:21.820 --> 40:25.824
OH, FINE.
I'LL TAKE HER NOW.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.996
COME ON, SWEETIE.

40:34.062 --> 40:35.864
WAIT.

40:35.864 --> 40:37.205
DON'T GO.

40:38.507 --> 40:40.769
WE HAVE MARSHMALLOWS
AND CHOCOLATE.

40:40.769 --> 40:42.611
I CAN MAKE S'MORES.

40:42.611 --> 40:45.113
WOULD YOU LIKE THAT,
MY LITTLE PRINCESS?

40:45.113 --> 40:46.645
YEAH!

40:46.645 --> 40:48.747
YEAH.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.949

40:50.949 --> 40:52.951
YOU SAID YOU HAD WORK.

40:55.484 --> 40:57.886
IT CAN WAIT.

40:57.886 --> 41:00.589
I ALWAYS HAVE TIME
FOR MY GIRLS.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.468
(Dave) I ALWAYS HAVE TIME
FOR MY GIRLS.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.579
(buzzer sounds)

41:42.130 --> 41:44.633
(Mary Alice)
THERE WAS A WEDDING RECENTLY

41:44.633 --> 41:47.576
AT FAIRVIEW
PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.

41:47.576 --> 41:52.711
(speaking inaudibly)
 THE MINISTER SPOKE
ABOUT THE NATURE OF MARRIAGE...

41:54.813 --> 41:57.646
THE SUBLIME JOY
OF GIVING BIRTH...

41:57.646 --> 42:00.148
(mouths words)

42:03.722 --> 42:06.555
THE IMMENSE PLEASURE
OF RAISING A FAMILY...

42:11.800 --> 42:14.803
THE IMPORTANCE OF FIDELITY...

42:18.607 --> 42:20.569
(speaks inaudibly)

42:20.569 --> 42:23.071
AND THEN HE SAID
WHAT ALL MINISTERS SAY

42:23.071 --> 42:25.073
TO CONCLUDE SUCH MATTERS...

42:25.073 --> 42:27.576
YOU MAY NOW KISS THE BRIDE.

42:31.720 --> 42:33.722
FOR A MOMENT,

42:33.722 --> 42:38.026
THE GROOM WONDERED IF
HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING.

42:40.028 --> 42:43.692
(bell tolling)
 THAT'S WHEN THE BELLS
BEGAN TO RING,

42:43.692 --> 42:46.695
TELLING HIM HE HAD.
