00:12.480 --> 00:13.345
Ah!

00:13.447 --> 00:16.448
Man, Sage is angrier than usual.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.150
I win. Ha!

00:18.252 --> 00:20.419
Yeah. Ha, ha, ha.
That's right...

00:20.521 --> 00:23.422
Thanks to the crouching
cacti move I taught you.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.226
Oh, please, I did the hard part.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.961
All you did was the
teaching part.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.696
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.

00:30.798 --> 00:31.930
Did I hear you?

00:32.033 --> 00:33.832
Do you think teaching is easy?

00:33.934 --> 00:35.200
Yes.

00:37.338 --> 00:40.672
Uh, yes, I don't.

00:40.775 --> 00:42.408
Teaching is not easy!

00:42.510 --> 00:45.044
Go take some laps and think
about what you said.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.812
All right. Let's go, Buttercup,

00:46.914 --> 00:48.781
- if I'm running...
- Then I'm skipping.

00:53.788 --> 00:55.054
It's Sorceress Spitzalot.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.156
Spit shields, up!

00:58.426 --> 01:02.261
Salutations, Knight Schoolers.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.829
There's too much spit.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.764
Our shields aren't gonna hold.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.400
Spitzy, why are you here?

01:08.502 --> 01:11.070
Due to a magical mishap,

01:11.172 --> 01:13.172
the Spitzalot School of Sorcery

01:13.274 --> 01:17.476
sank to the bottom Loogie Lake.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.079
I'm sorry. I'll send you
some snot-proof socks.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.847
Here we go. Bye-bye.

01:21.949 --> 01:24.983
I was hoping you'd
share your school

01:25.086 --> 01:27.886
with a few of my
students for a while.

01:27.988 --> 01:31.023
Well, our schools are rivals.

01:31.125 --> 01:34.259
But the knights' code says
to help those in need.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.095
You can stay. I'll just...

01:36.197 --> 01:38.363
order some more towels.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.065
Splendid!

01:40.167 --> 01:43.735
Say hello to my star
students, Team Hex!

01:46.173 --> 01:48.907
Hi! I'm Ciara.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.876
This is Arc, Warwick and Prudy.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.444
We're the Phoenix Squad.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.113
I'm Sebastian.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.415
Yes, that Sebastian.

01:58.586 --> 02:02.554
He's a three-time Most
Valuable Sorcerer.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.189
Oh, Violet, stop.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.425
Bragging about me is my job.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.262
You may be the best
sorcerer in your school,

02:10.364 --> 02:12.898
but Warwick is the
best in this school.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.333
We heard all about you choosing

02:14.435 --> 02:16.101
knight school over our school.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.103
You really punched the
pooch on that one.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.573
Now, now, Violet.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.243
I'm sure they're all going to
become fantastic knights...

02:24.345 --> 02:28.280
Even this one whose arms are
clearly too long for his body.

02:34.088 --> 02:36.655
Anyway, it was nice
meeting you all...

02:36.757 --> 02:39.725
Especially you, Chiaro.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.193
Her name is Ciara.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.761
My apologies, Kudy.

02:46.934 --> 02:47.934
So, we hate them, right?

02:50.070 --> 02:51.603
It's fine. It's a big castle.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.405
We'll probably never see them.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.174
Uh, Team Hex will be staying

02:55.276 --> 02:57.075
in your Squad Room for
the next few weeks.

02:57.178 --> 02:59.178
Okay. So, we'll see
them every day.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.984
♪ Yeah yeah yeah hey ♪

03:06.086 --> 03:07.330
What are you doing
here, Buttercup?

03:07.354 --> 03:08.687
I asked Sage to come.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.355
But she's my BFF.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.324
We're ride or die.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.226
Yeah, I don't know what
that means, but...

03:14.328 --> 03:15.827
but you get down
with your bad self.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.032
Uh-huh. So, why am I here?

03:20.134 --> 03:21.967
Well, since you think
teaching is easy,

03:22.069 --> 03:23.302
you're going to teach children

03:23.404 --> 03:24.937
who want to be knights one day.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.305
Kids?

03:26.407 --> 03:28.173
That's gonna be a piece of cake.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.043
Okay.

03:31.145 --> 03:33.078
Meet the Knighty Knights!

03:36.383 --> 03:39.117
Aw, those kids are so adorable.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.586
Hey, cutie-pies!

03:40.688 --> 03:41.853
Can it, lady!

03:44.491 --> 03:46.925
Knighty Knights, assemble!

03:50.097 --> 03:53.198
Students, this is your teacher
for the day, Ms. Sage.

03:53.300 --> 03:57.469
This is Brea, Georgie,
Punchie and Bitie.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.771
New teacher, I brought
you a present.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.040
Ooh, I like presents.
Give it to me.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.675
Okay.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.846
Yeah. Good luck, Teach.

04:10.084 --> 04:11.416
I don't need luck.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.352
I won't let these little
monsters get to me.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.354
Knighty Knight salute!

04:18.826 --> 04:20.305
I don't know what
that hurts so much,

04:20.394 --> 04:21.394
but it does!

04:24.298 --> 04:25.998
All right, it's unfair
we have to share

04:26.100 --> 04:27.165
our room with Team Hex.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.834
And it's mean how
they made fun of

04:28.936 --> 04:30.769
Arc's long arms.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.037
Yeah.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.606
My nana says they make
for perfect hugs.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.878
Remember, knights
help those in need.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.280
Make yourselves at home.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.181
Thank you, Chalupa.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.850
You know that's not my name!

04:46.153 --> 04:48.553
Violet, poof in our things.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.822
Vidatour sorcee stuffee!

04:54.728 --> 04:55.761
My toe!

04:57.031 --> 04:59.131
Okay, when she said, "make
yourselves at home,"

04:59.233 --> 05:00.243
this isn't what she meant,

05:00.267 --> 05:02.734
right, Chalupa?

05:02.836 --> 05:04.436
I mean, Ciara.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.339
All right, get rid
of this garbage.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.274
Violet, you heard the man.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.677
Get rid of the garbage.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.079
Begoneth Phoenix Squadeth!

05:17.785 --> 05:20.052

05:53.020 --> 05:56.121
Well, my eyeball sees
that nothing has changed.

05:57.558 --> 06:01.993
Sir Gareth, the Phoenix Squad
won't share this room.

06:02.096 --> 06:05.364
We hung a portrait of our
beloved Sorceress Spitzalot,

06:05.466 --> 06:08.567
and they turned it into
Sorceress 'Stashalot.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.541
And we were so sweet to them.

06:16.643 --> 06:17.976
That's what hurts the most.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.511
Oh...

06:19.613 --> 06:21.813
Spitzy, these accusations do
not sound like my students.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.716
Well, my students
wouldn't lie to me.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.018
Sebastian's the son
I've always wished for,

06:27.121 --> 06:29.321
and Violet is always...

06:29.423 --> 06:31.156
standing next to him.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.792
Then she's standing next to

06:33.894 --> 06:34.894
a big, old meany head.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.929
Ooh, that's a ten burn!

06:38.031 --> 06:39.831
I'm surprised you can
count that high.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.735
Oh, we can count
all the numbers!

06:43.837 --> 06:47.072
One, two, three, five, six!

06:47.174 --> 06:50.542
I know I forgot four!
I'm just really upset!

07:00.854 --> 07:02.654
Clearly this situation
is not working out.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.489
Sir Gareth, we must
go to the king

07:04.591 --> 07:06.358
so he can resolve this matter.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.861
Game over.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.830
The king loves
Sorceress Spitzalot.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.765
She'll poof in some
magic pizza for him,

07:13.867 --> 07:16.802
and this Squad
Room will be ours.

07:16.904 --> 07:17.803
Come on, Team Hex,

07:17.905 --> 07:19.404
let's go to the training yard

07:19.506 --> 07:22.207
and accidentally throw their
equipment over the cliff.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.045
Guys, we have to catch them.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.581
Arc, we've gotta do something

07:29.683 --> 07:31.383
to get Team Hex out of our room.

07:32.419 --> 07:33.963
We've gotta get them
out of our school.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.086
As long as they're here,

07:35.189 --> 07:36.755
our lives are gonna
be miserable.

07:36.857 --> 07:37.857
You're right.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.691
We take knight
school underground.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.393
We train in the dark.

07:43.664 --> 07:47.232
Or we get the princess
to talk to the king.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.301
Daughter outweighs pizza, right?

07:49.403 --> 07:52.437
Oh, it depends on
how hungry he is.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.678
For some reason, these
kids would rather have fun

07:59.780 --> 08:02.180
than follow the rules.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.882
Know what? I've had it.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.584
No more Miss Nice Sage.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.455
Sage School is now in session.

08:10.557 --> 08:13.258
Knighty Knights, line up!

08:15.996 --> 08:17.829
I told Sir Gareth
teaching was easy.

08:17.931 --> 08:21.166
All I needed was a
big scary stick!

08:21.268 --> 08:23.535
Stand at attention!

08:25.439 --> 08:27.272
You all look...

08:27.374 --> 08:29.841
weak!

08:29.943 --> 08:32.143
You need uniforms.

08:32.246 --> 08:34.880
Yes.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.182
They look like three
little Sages.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.950
And she's a little Butt.

08:42.589 --> 08:45.090
The king's about to arrive
and tell us his decision.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.892
Where's Ciara?

08:46.994 --> 08:48.927
Uh, well, she wanted
to be here, but she...

08:49.029 --> 08:50.629
Stop talking, Arc. The
princess is here.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.901
Enjoy the magic
pizza, Your Majesty.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.435
Every time you take a bite,

08:57.538 --> 08:58.803
it grows back.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.109
Oh...

09:04.211 --> 09:06.411
This is the happiest I've
ever been in my life!

09:08.715 --> 09:09.881
Whatever.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.716
I never liked the
Squad Room anyway.

09:11.818 --> 09:12.851
I'm lying!

09:12.953 --> 09:14.653
I love it more than
goblins love pie!

09:14.755 --> 09:16.354
Relax, all right?

09:16.456 --> 09:18.189
I've got a feeling that
the king's decision

09:18.292 --> 09:20.091
will make us very happy.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.063
Have you made a
decision, Your Majesty?

09:25.165 --> 09:27.165
Oh, before you decide, I'd
like to say something,

09:27.267 --> 09:28.934
since I barely know
what's going on,

09:29.036 --> 09:31.169
and don't have any favorites.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.470
Well, Sweetums,

09:32.573 --> 09:34.940
please tell me your
unbiased opinion.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.808
It doesn't matter who
gets the Squad Room

09:36.910 --> 09:40.011
because these two schools
have been rivals for years.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.814
There's no way they
can share the school.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.550
But sharing is caring.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.919
How would you feel
if you had to share

09:48.021 --> 09:49.487
your pizza with Sir Gareth?

09:49.590 --> 09:50.855
Oh.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.791
I'd sooner let him starve.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.294
I've slayed like four
dragons for you.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.697
Then you should be able
to get your own pizza!

10:00.467 --> 10:03.201
The point is some things
aren't meant to be shared.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.439
Your pizza logic
has convinced me.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.742
This school will not be shared.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.244
Yes!

10:13.347 --> 10:15.213
Instead, Phoenix
Squad and Team Hex

10:15.315 --> 10:16.848
will battle for the school.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.249
No!

10:21.121 --> 10:22.153
Winners stay.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.189
Losers move to Loogie Lake.

10:26.393 --> 10:29.260
So, wait, we're gonna
lose our school now?

10:29.363 --> 10:30.729
How did that happen?

10:31.798 --> 10:34.232
Not with my involvement,
that's for sure.

10:39.373 --> 10:41.439
♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪

10:41.541 --> 10:44.376
Guys, we're totally
gonna win that battle.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.910
But on the off-chance

10:46.013 --> 10:48.179
that we do lose the school,
what are we gonna do?

10:48.281 --> 10:50.582
We can't let Team Hex win.

10:50.684 --> 10:54.853
The princess isn't into
long-distance relationships.

10:54.955 --> 10:55.987
I assume...

10:56.089 --> 10:58.223
since we've never spoken.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.326
All right, more importantly,

11:01.428 --> 11:03.495
I have several months
of memories here.

11:03.597 --> 11:06.564
Oh, no, now I'm crying.

11:06.667 --> 11:10.468
But if you cry, I'm gonna cry.

11:10.570 --> 11:14.406
Oh, here come the giant tears.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.676
Guys, knights don't cry.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.179
Guess we should
call Phoenix Squad

11:21.281 --> 11:23.915
the Baby Squad.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.951
Oh, go easy on them, Violet.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.853
They're about to
lose their school.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.590
We are totally keeping
this sweet foosball table.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.259
We're not gonna lose our school

11:34.361 --> 11:35.471
because we're gonna work hard

11:35.495 --> 11:37.429
and win that competition.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.831
Oh, working hard.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.433
That is so cute.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.636
You see, we don't
have to work hard.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.172
We can use magic for anything...

11:47.274 --> 11:48.840
Especially winning.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.447
Did he just giggle evilly?

11:55.549 --> 11:57.282
That's just how he giggles.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.917
I do it, too.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.391
Guys, they're totally
gonna cheat.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.493
I know because innocent
people giggle like this.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.063
But cheaters giggle like this.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.168
Do you hear the difference?

12:20.907 --> 12:24.109
I'm starting to hear it.
Keep it going.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.077
Or he could just
get to the point.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.413
Okay, look, Team Hex is a
bunch of cheating cheaters,

12:28.515 --> 12:30.682
so, if they're gonna
cheat, we should cheat.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.917
To be clear, let's cheat.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.486
We can't do that.

12:34.588 --> 12:37.222
We have to stay true
to the knights' code.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.958
Fine.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.993
We'll do the right thing.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.394
But just in case they win,

12:43.497 --> 12:45.377
I'm licking every handle
on that foosball table.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.000

Georgie, first rule
of Sage School!

If you're not in our
squad, you're an enemy.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.976
Correct! Brea, second rule!

12:58.078 --> 13:00.078
Do whatever you can to
take out your enemy.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.246

Dang, I am a great teacher.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.984
Clap for me.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.808
Now clap for Buttercup
because she is delightful.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.793
Well, I will be in
the teachers' lounge

13:14.895 --> 13:17.662
drinking your juice boxes.
Bye-bye!

13:18.532 --> 13:20.765
Good job, guys.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.901
Miss Sage said to take
out our enemies, right?

13:23.003 --> 13:23.802
Yep!

13:23.904 --> 13:25.270
And if you're not on our squad,

13:25.372 --> 13:26.504
you're an enemy?

13:26.606 --> 13:28.640
Yeppity-yep.

13:28.742 --> 13:31.075
So, that makes you and
Miss Sage our enemies?

13:31.178 --> 13:33.244
I guess so. Why do you ask?

13:33.346 --> 13:35.113
No reason.

13:39.085 --> 13:42.887
Welcome to the battle
for knight school.

13:42.989 --> 13:46.324
First team to win two out
of three events stays.

13:46.426 --> 13:50.361
Losers get Loogied.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.863
For the first event,

13:51.965 --> 13:55.200
each team will yank
on a large rope

13:55.302 --> 13:57.302
trying to pull the other team

13:57.404 --> 14:00.038
into a pit full of swamp slugs.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.074
It's called The Slug of War.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.377
Let me guess. You named it?

14:06.479 --> 14:07.812
Pretty good, right?

14:07.914 --> 14:08.914
Sure.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.451
See, Arc, we don't
have to cheat.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.453
There's no way we're
gonna lose a Slug of War

14:15.555 --> 14:17.288
with a powerful
giant on our team.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.424
I could probably use one hand.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.626
Sorcerers have no
upper body strength.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.262
It's true.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.264
But, thanks to all
the hand waving,

14:26.366 --> 14:28.600
we have very strong wrists.

14:30.604 --> 14:32.170
Just so you know,

14:32.272 --> 14:33.738
once we take this school,

14:33.840 --> 14:35.585
we're going to knock down
everything you love,

14:35.609 --> 14:37.041
and poof in some new stuff.

14:37.143 --> 14:40.178
Yeah, we're gonna poof
all over this place.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.448
Students!

14:43.550 --> 14:45.984
- Grab your ropes!
- I...

14:46.086 --> 14:48.119
It's like you're
doing it on purpose.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.224
And...

14:53.326 --> 14:55.293
begin!

14:55.395 --> 14:58.396
Uh-oh, they're winning.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.064
Not for long.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.000
Invisibility pushy-wushy.

15:03.837 --> 15:06.804
Oh! Something's pushing me!

15:06.907 --> 15:09.007
- What?
- And I can't stop it!

15:09.109 --> 15:10.541
Oh, no!

15:15.682 --> 15:17.982
Ah, swamp bugs!

15:18.084 --> 15:20.251
They're everywhere!

15:20.353 --> 15:21.853
I've got slugbrows.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.926
Success! Sorcerers
take round one.

15:28.028 --> 15:31.729
Looks like we pushed our
way into first place.

15:31.831 --> 15:34.232
You mean "pulled," right?

15:34.334 --> 15:35.800
Of course, Sorceress.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.203
Did you hear that?

15:39.306 --> 15:41.406
Those cheating cheaters cheated.

15:41.508 --> 15:45.143
Guys, if we lose the next
battle, we lose the school.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.678
We have to do something.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.646
This is where Ciara says
that we have to behave

15:48.748 --> 15:50.248
and follow the knights' code.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.382
Forget the code.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.351
We have to cheat!

15:53.453 --> 15:54.886
I don't know where Ciara went,

15:54.988 --> 15:56.754
but I like you.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.161

Okay, for the next event,
we're gonna have to

16:04.264 --> 16:06.531
break down a large wooden
door using a battering ram.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.953
This is how we're
going to cheat.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.435
Ooh, how about we put
honey in their shoes,

16:10.537 --> 16:12.470
so they get chased by bears?

16:12.572 --> 16:14.806
Man, I'm good at this.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.509
Okay. All right. Yeah, maybe.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.378
But I think that we
should probably...

16:20.480 --> 16:21.813
Oh, I know!

16:21.915 --> 16:23.781
Before the event,
we'll hug each member

16:23.883 --> 16:26.217
of Team Hex for a
really long time.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.186
Then they'll care about
us too much to cheat.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.524
What?

16:33.626 --> 16:35.259
I've got it.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.562
We hug them while bears
lick their honey shoes.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.607
And I guess you
have a better plan.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.009
Yes, I do.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.877
Okay, last week, Warwick used

16:52.979 --> 16:54.612
a roasting spell
on our hot dogs.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.414
Delish, by the way.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.350
He could roast their
battering ram

16:59.452 --> 17:01.719
making it so hot, they
couldn't touch it.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.055
Uh, how's that gonna work
with the honey shoes?

17:04.156 --> 17:05.823
We're not doing the honey shoes!

17:10.630 --> 17:12.964
Miss Sage, Sir Gareth is coming

17:13.066 --> 17:14.932
and he looks real mad.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.835
But why? I didn't do anything.

17:17.936 --> 17:19.503
Yeah, I did a lot of stuff.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.540
Wait here, I'll get rid of him.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.075
Oh, thanks, Brea.

17:24.176 --> 17:26.176
I'm gonna let you keep
your juice box tomorrow.

17:27.981 --> 17:30.181
Ooh, under these leaves,
there's a mystery net.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.416
What?

17:39.492 --> 17:41.893
Oh, ha, ha.

17:41.995 --> 17:44.529
Put me down! I am your teacher!

17:44.631 --> 17:46.097
And I'm Buttercup.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.367
But you're not members
of our squad,

17:49.469 --> 17:51.302
so you're an enemy.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.404
And you taught us

17:52.472 --> 17:54.439
to do whatever we can
to take out an enemy.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.374
You've been taken out!

17:58.545 --> 17:59.744
Well, you trapped us.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.746
But I would have taken
it a step further.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.148
We did. That net's
tied to a zip line.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.952
It goes to the river.
Hope you can swim.

18:09.689 --> 18:10.922
Now are you ready to admit

18:11.024 --> 18:12.334
to Sir Gareth that
teaching is hard?

18:12.358 --> 18:14.325
No! And we're never gonna
tell him about this.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.760
We won't have to.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.822
He's over there laughing
with the Knighty Knights.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.640
All right, guys,

18:28.741 --> 18:30.274
whether we win this
battle or not,

18:30.376 --> 18:32.610
you guys have embraced cheating.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.313
And that means so much to me.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.384
I love cheating. Let's do this.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.087
Phoenix Squad.

18:43.189 --> 18:46.190
Look, I may be severely far
sighted and missing an eye,

18:46.292 --> 18:49.727
but even I can see that
Team Hex plays dirty.

18:49.829 --> 18:53.698
So, I have a feeling
they're goin' down, sir.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.104
Well, I'd rather
teach you students

19:00.206 --> 19:01.672
at the bottom of Loogie Lake,

19:01.774 --> 19:03.875
than teach those
cheaters anywhere.

19:05.411 --> 19:07.111
You live by the knights' code...

19:07.213 --> 19:09.046
Which makes your honorable.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.388
So, is everyone
feeling terrible?

19:17.490 --> 19:21.392
I'm just gonna go with
super awful, but, yeah.

19:21.494 --> 19:25.029
Even if Team Hex is
gonna cheat, we can't.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.698
It's not what knights do.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.667
She's right.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.402
Why is Sir Gareth
such a good example?

19:34.474 --> 19:36.374
It's time.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.676
Team Hex, begin!

19:48.922 --> 19:50.855
All they did was
smash a tiny hole.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.690
We got this.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.458
Phoenix Squad.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.727
Break that door like where
you live depends on it...

19:56.829 --> 19:58.196
Because it does!

20:07.073 --> 20:09.173
There's no damage to the door?

20:09.275 --> 20:11.576
That was a waste of a speech.

20:11.678 --> 20:14.612
Team Hex is the winner!

20:18.518 --> 20:19.717
What happened?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.859
Team Hex must have cheated
away my giant's strength.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.189
Look, the door!

20:24.224 --> 20:26.023
Oh!

20:26.125 --> 20:28.526
I got the door. Get them out.

20:28.628 --> 20:29.860
Come on!

20:35.034 --> 20:36.901
Well done, students.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.136
Prudy, you still have
your giant's strength.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.871
Wait, then how did
Team Hex cheat?

20:40.974 --> 20:43.541
Don't be ridiculous.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.810
Sebastian, did you cheat?

20:45.912 --> 20:48.779
I can't lie.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.448
No.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.385
- I believe him.
- I don't.

20:54.487 --> 20:57.188
Epitus speakee truthus!

20:57.290 --> 20:59.724
Like your spell's
going to work on him.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.292
I totally cheated.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.160
Hey, so, I got this
awesome spring

21:03.263 --> 21:04.495
I put in their battering ram.

21:06.766 --> 21:07.999
I'd do it again.

21:08.101 --> 21:11.369
And the blond boy's arms
are perfectly normal.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.770
I knew it.

21:13.873 --> 21:17.908
Which means Team Hex
is disqualified.

21:18.011 --> 21:19.310
Yes!

21:19.412 --> 21:22.480
I'm so ashamed!

21:22.582 --> 21:23.582
It's time for Team Hex

21:23.683 --> 21:28.819
to go back to the snotty
shores of Loogie Lake.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.455
You spit a lot when you talk.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.557
Turn the spell off.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.361
I'm proud of you, Phoenix Squad.

21:37.463 --> 21:40.298
You saved the school,
and the king,

21:40.400 --> 21:42.466
who left behind his pizza.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.035
Double win.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.836
Don't you dare, Gareth!

21:45.938 --> 21:47.371
Oh, gotta go.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.342
See? I told you,

21:51.444 --> 21:53.644
if we followed the
knights' code, we'd win.

21:53.746 --> 21:54.945
You were right, Ciara.

21:55.048 --> 21:56.147
But, more importantly,

21:56.249 --> 21:59.650
- my arms are normal!
