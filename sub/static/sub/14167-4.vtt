00:53.792 --> 00:55.826
Why'd you do that to your door?

00:58.429 --> 00:59.797
Because.

01:01.099 --> 01:04.400
Come on. I need your help.

01:04.435 --> 01:06.936
Safety is an illusion.

01:06.970 --> 01:09.472
People are nihilists, Nate.

01:09.507 --> 01:11.741
They're gonna rape and kill and steal

01:11.775 --> 01:13.210
just 'cause they want to,

01:13.244 --> 01:15.478
sometimes even 'cause they're bored.

01:15.513 --> 01:18.081
It's fucking scary when you think about it.

01:18.115 --> 01:19.882
Our house...

01:19.917 --> 01:22.451
Wide open.

01:22.485 --> 01:25.054
There aren't nearly
enough cops in Los Angeles,

01:25.089 --> 01:28.490
so it's on us... To protect ourselves.

01:28.525 --> 01:30.093
Okay, well, then, why are we

01:30.127 --> 01:31.928
only putting bars on your window?

01:33.330 --> 01:36.065
'Cause it's a pain in the
ass to fucking install.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.566
Come on. We got more work to do.

01:37.601 --> 01:40.001
Where are you going?

01:40.036 --> 01:41.803
Out.

01:41.838 --> 01:43.239
Out and about.

01:43.273 --> 01:45.774
But I need you to stay away
from the house tonight, okay?

01:45.808 --> 01:47.209
Why?

01:47.244 --> 01:49.278
'Cause I need you to.

01:49.312 --> 01:52.414
Hey.

01:52.449 --> 01:54.249
What the fuck is going on with you, man?

01:56.119 --> 01:58.586
I'm gonna tell you
everything tonight, okay?

01:58.621 --> 02:00.622
Go have fun. Do something fun.

02:00.656 --> 02:03.792
Go see a movie, whatever it is you do.

02:05.261 --> 02:07.395
- I'll take care of you, all right?
- Yeah.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.116
What the fuck?

03:07.114 --> 03:09.082
Hey.

03:09.116 --> 03:11.117
Hello, sir?

03:11.152 --> 03:13.953
Uh, yeah, no, we didn't...
we didn't order this.

03:13.988 --> 03:15.354
This isn't ours.

03:15.389 --> 03:17.790
You can put this back on the
truck 'cause we didn't order it.

03:24.064 --> 03:26.131
Fuck me.

03:34.273 --> 03:35.708
Oh, ho! Ah!

03:35.742 --> 03:37.442
- Bad time?
- No!

03:37.476 --> 03:40.312
My God, look at you! The man, the myth!

03:40.346 --> 03:41.814
Nothing changes.

03:41.848 --> 03:43.882
How are you, my friend? Good to see you.

03:43.917 --> 03:45.150
You too. Good to see you.

03:45.185 --> 03:46.618
- Goddamn, you're sweaty!
- I'm sweaty.

03:46.652 --> 03:48.253
It's fucking hot as hell out there.

03:48.287 --> 03:49.787
We don't get the ocean breeze like you do.

03:49.822 --> 03:50.955
Oh, what is this?

03:50.989 --> 03:52.890
I'm a growing boy, man.
What do you want from me?

03:52.925 --> 03:54.392
Forgive me. Forgive me.

03:54.427 --> 03:56.695
- Garo, take you time.
- No. Mmm!

03:56.729 --> 03:59.264
Hey...

03:59.298 --> 04:00.765
I'm sorry to hear about
what happened to Nate.

04:00.799 --> 04:02.900
Oh, thanks. Thank you.
No, he's o... he's okay.

04:02.935 --> 04:04.703
- He's doing good.
- They find the shitheads?

04:04.737 --> 04:06.570
Not yet. Police are working on it.

04:06.605 --> 04:09.607
You know, I got a lot of
cousins out here... old country.

04:09.641 --> 04:12.143
Yeah, the last thing I
need is owing you a favor.

04:12.177 --> 04:14.145
I mean it, though.

04:14.179 --> 04:16.814
Anything you need, anything,
all you have to do is ask.

04:16.849 --> 04:18.315
I appreciate it. I do.

04:18.350 --> 04:22.052
Actually, I came here 'cause I
think I have something for you.

04:22.086 --> 04:24.321
Ryan Wheeler wants to fight again.

04:24.356 --> 04:26.790
- Wheeler?
- Yeah.

04:26.824 --> 04:28.692
That's some shit. How is he?

04:28.727 --> 04:30.227
Hasn't missed a beat.

04:30.262 --> 04:32.763
- Is he clean?
- Yeah, complete 180.

04:32.797 --> 04:35.098
Kid's living like a monk.
He's got his head on straight.

04:35.133 --> 04:37.768
I'm very impressed... very impressed.

04:37.802 --> 04:40.336
I'm
putting together a big show.

04:40.371 --> 04:41.905
You got a main card?

04:41.939 --> 04:43.539
I'm down the road with a couple of guys.

04:43.574 --> 04:44.641
Really?

04:44.675 --> 04:45.976
'Cause I hear one of your guys fell out

04:46.010 --> 04:47.244
and you have half a card.

04:47.278 --> 04:49.246
You're gonna get a bigger
name than Ryan Wheeler

04:49.280 --> 04:51.915
with his story... four years
in jail, first fight out.

04:51.949 --> 04:54.350
We're putting a lot of
asses in a lot of seats.

04:54.385 --> 04:56.552
Is he ready? I'm only five weeks out.

04:56.587 --> 04:57.553
Who's the fight?

04:57.588 --> 04:59.922
Matt Rynders out of Cocoa Beach, Florida.

04:59.956 --> 05:02.425
The guy's a fucking killer.
This ain't no tune-up fight.

05:02.459 --> 05:03.893
Yeah, I know.

05:03.927 --> 05:06.962
Five weeks is tight, but, uh,
I'm gonna have to talk to him.

05:06.997 --> 05:08.731
In the event that he does say yes, though,

05:08.766 --> 05:10.933
you do me a favor, and you
keep it quiet for a minute.

05:10.967 --> 05:13.035
Keep it quiet? You just gave
me his whole fucking story,

05:13.069 --> 05:14.670
and I can't promote a fucking secret, man!

05:14.704 --> 05:16.638
You keep your mouth shut
for two fucking minutes.

05:16.673 --> 05:17.739
That's all I ask.

05:17.774 --> 05:19.175
You can say that you got a big fighter.

05:19.209 --> 05:22.178
I'll give you plenty of time
to make your gate... my word.

05:22.212 --> 05:25.681
You give me Ryan Wheeler,
the old Wheeler, the savage,

05:25.715 --> 05:27.183
you give me that guy,

05:27.217 --> 05:29.685
I'll suck your dick
until your head collapses.

05:30.787 --> 05:32.220
- You don't change.
- How can I change?

05:32.254 --> 05:33.689
You're still as beautiful as always.

05:33.723 --> 05:34.989
I-I look at you. I don't know.

05:35.024 --> 05:37.392
I forget. Am I straight?
Am I gay? I have no idea.

05:37.427 --> 05:38.993
- Thank you. I'm gonna call you.
- Okay, my friend.

05:39.028 --> 05:40.796
- Send Nate my best, huh?
- I will.

05:40.830 --> 05:42.631
I mean it about that offer.

05:52.107 --> 05:55.009
Asparagus. Sorry, man.

07:02.342 --> 07:04.110
What's with the shit outside?

07:04.144 --> 07:06.412
It's a gift from
our friend Allison Castro.

07:06.446 --> 07:08.246
- Allison the investor chick?
- Yeah.

07:08.281 --> 07:10.282
I thought you were gonna tell her no.

07:10.316 --> 07:12.017
- I did.
- When you start taking gifts from these people,

07:12.051 --> 07:13.485
then we can't get rid of them.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.788
They're like fucking leeches,
man. They own your ass.

07:15.822 --> 07:18.023
I know. I've left her
three messages. I'm on it.

07:18.057 --> 07:20.559
Jesus.

07:20.593 --> 07:22.093
Amazing.

07:22.128 --> 07:24.562
You look exhausted. Where have you been?

07:24.596 --> 07:26.731
I drove to North Hollywood.

07:26.765 --> 07:27.732
Why?

07:27.766 --> 07:29.534
I went to see Garo Kassabian,

07:29.568 --> 07:31.502
who wants Ryan for the king beast card.

07:31.537 --> 07:32.904
Main title.

07:32.939 --> 07:35.573
But I thought that the
training hasn't been going well.

07:35.607 --> 07:38.176
It hasn't, but this throws
a stake in the ground,

07:38.210 --> 07:40.177
keeps him focused on something.

07:40.211 --> 07:41.646
Always helped me.

07:41.680 --> 07:42.914
He's your fighter.

07:42.948 --> 07:45.349
Really? That's all you got
for me... "he's your fighter"?

07:45.383 --> 07:47.685
He's your fighter. I've got
my own fighter to worry about.

07:47.719 --> 07:49.053
What does that mean?

07:50.422 --> 07:52.557
I'm getting Jay a fight.

07:52.591 --> 07:55.225
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

07:55.260 --> 07:57.561
You've never managed a fighter before.

07:57.595 --> 07:59.263
There's a first time for everything.

07:59.297 --> 08:01.465
And any promoter that would
sign Jay can't be trusted.

08:01.499 --> 08:03.233
Why the fuck do you want
to get involved with this?

08:03.268 --> 08:04.634
What are you doing?

08:04.669 --> 08:07.104
Jay's a brilliant fighter, and I
really think he could be a star.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.272
Oh, Jesus.

08:08.306 --> 08:09.706
You know, I don't expect
you to help me, Alvey.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.708
I just don't want you to interfere.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.376
Okay.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.545
You want to do this?
You do this on your own.

08:15.580 --> 08:17.514
- Fine.
- And he's not representing my gym.

08:17.548 --> 08:19.015
He fights unaffiliated.

08:19.049 --> 08:21.417
Okay, but he's training here.

08:21.452 --> 08:22.819
Not when Ryan's training.

08:22.854 --> 08:24.521
- Alvey, come on.
- No, no, no, no.

08:24.555 --> 08:25.555
Come in.

08:25.590 --> 08:26.790
Alvey?

08:26.824 --> 08:29.725
There's some cop out here looking for you.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.231
Detective Gaines.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.599
- How goes?
- Ah, good.

08:36.633 --> 08:38.400
I was actually looking for Nate.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.836
I have a few questions I want to ask him.

08:40.871 --> 08:43.206
Nate is... is not here. What's going on?

08:43.240 --> 08:44.707
I just need to talk to him,

08:44.741 --> 08:45.975
get clarity of a couple of things.

08:46.009 --> 08:47.843
- You check the house?
- Yeah, I did.

08:47.878 --> 08:50.713
He's not there, either. And
he's not returning my calls.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.648
Actually starting to hurt
my feelings a little bit.

08:53.984 --> 08:56.151
Truth of the matter is that
if we're gonna get these guys,

08:56.185 --> 08:57.920
I really need Nate's cooperation.

08:57.954 --> 09:01.189
Yeah, absolutely, yeah. I, uh... Jesus.

09:01.224 --> 09:03.091
I'll bring him down this afternoon.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.726
- That'd be good. Okay.
- Okay.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.661
Hey, listen, how's your other son?

09:06.695 --> 09:09.264
Jay. He's... What the fuck did he do?

09:09.298 --> 09:11.900
Oh, nothing, nothing. I'm just asking.

09:11.934 --> 09:13.635
- I'll see you later, huh?
- Yeah.

09:17.740 --> 09:19.473
Jay.

09:27.490 --> 09:29.023
Hey, Keith.

09:29.057 --> 09:31.726
Your phone was ringing.

09:36.764 --> 09:38.632
Hey, Keith?

09:38.666 --> 09:39.633
Yeah?

09:39.667 --> 09:41.135
Please don't lie on my bed.

09:41.169 --> 09:43.104
You got your own bed.

09:43.138 --> 09:45.172
Oh, sorry. I didn't think you'd get mad.

09:45.207 --> 09:47.908
Oh, hey, I'm not mad. I'm just telling you.

09:47.942 --> 09:50.276
It's all right.

09:55.572 --> 09:56.672
It's from someone called Alvey.

09:56.706 --> 09:58.440
I got it. I got it.

09:58.475 --> 09:59.708
Yeah.

09:59.743 --> 10:01.977
Welcome to voice-mail system.

10:02.011 --> 10:04.380
Hey, Ryan, it's me. Change of plans.

10:13.522 --> 10:16.024
Hey, Nate! Nathan!

10:18.460 --> 10:20.628
Hey!

10:22.864 --> 10:25.065
It's your father!

10:25.100 --> 10:26.167
Hey.

10:26.201 --> 10:27.568
What's up?

10:27.603 --> 10:28.636
What's up?

10:28.671 --> 10:31.872
- I'm just hanging out.
- Can I come in?

10:31.907 --> 10:34.074
Uh, no, I was just about to
head out to physical therapy.

10:34.109 --> 10:35.843
All right, good. Well, you
know what? I'm gonna take you

10:35.877 --> 10:37.712
because I have to work some stuff
out with the insurance anyway.

10:37.746 --> 10:40.781
- Dad, it's fine. I'll... I'll just handle it.
- No, we're gonna go together,

10:40.816 --> 10:42.616
and then we're gonna
go see Detective Gaines,

10:42.650 --> 10:45.352
who said that you have not returned
a single one of his phone calls.

10:45.386 --> 10:46.821
What's going on, pal?

10:46.855 --> 10:49.356
Nothing. Let's just go.

10:49.390 --> 10:51.158
No, I want you to tell me what's going on.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.226
Nothing.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.528
Promise. It's all good.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.234
Hi.

11:01.268 --> 11:02.803
Hey.

11:06.748 --> 11:08.882
Did you talk to Alvey?

11:08.916 --> 11:10.751
He left a message.

11:10.785 --> 11:12.786
He said, uh, to do my conditioning,

11:12.820 --> 11:15.022
and then we'll hit it when he gets back.

11:15.056 --> 11:16.056
Yeah.

11:16.090 --> 11:18.191
It's all yours.

11:18.225 --> 11:19.926
Hey, uh, Alvey said there
was something important

11:19.961 --> 11:21.728
he wanted to talk to me
about. You know what that is?

11:21.763 --> 11:24.397
He'll talk to you when he gets back.

11:24.431 --> 11:25.899
Hey.

11:25.933 --> 11:29.569
If you don't want me
here alone, I can leave.

11:29.603 --> 11:31.337
It's fine.

11:31.372 --> 11:33.473
Got a shit ton of work to do in my office,

11:33.507 --> 11:35.642
and Alvey wants you to train.

11:44.851 --> 11:47.787
You're right. I got to get away from Terry.

11:47.821 --> 11:50.322
I-I got to get away from all of it.

11:50.356 --> 11:52.291
Uh...

11:52.325 --> 11:54.660
There are other ways for me to make money.

11:54.695 --> 11:57.063
I-I don't even need very much, anyway.

11:57.097 --> 11:59.765
Why don't you just come stay with us?

11:59.800 --> 12:03.402
Oh, honey, you're sweet.

12:03.436 --> 12:06.871
But I'm thinking I got to get out of here.

12:06.906 --> 12:08.807
I got to get away from L.A.

12:08.841 --> 12:11.210
and all the same old pack of losers

12:11.244 --> 12:13.011
that are always hanging around.

12:13.045 --> 12:15.581
I want something new...

12:15.615 --> 12:17.048
Crisp air.

12:17.083 --> 12:21.252
Uh, a-a clean slate is what I want.

12:21.286 --> 12:25.190
What do you mean? You're gonna move?

12:25.224 --> 12:27.558
Yeah. Why can't I move?

12:27.593 --> 12:30.895
- Where?
- I don't know.

12:30.930 --> 12:33.932
One of my best friends
just moved to Portland.

12:36.235 --> 12:38.269
Portland is a drug-infested fuckhole.

12:38.303 --> 12:40.238
Maybe not Portland.

12:40.272 --> 12:42.973
I want something with nature.

12:45.043 --> 12:47.745
Or whatever... whatever.

12:47.779 --> 12:51.381
These are just ideas, anyway.

12:53.351 --> 12:57.254
Uh, hey, could I get a
refill on this to go, please?

13:16.507 --> 13:18.442
Yo, Lisa!

13:18.476 --> 13:20.510
Yo!

13:20.544 --> 13:22.946
It's Bucky!

13:26.717 --> 13:28.618
That's right.

13:28.652 --> 13:30.252
Lisa!

13:31.655 --> 13:33.556
Holy shit... Ryan Wheeler!

13:33.591 --> 13:34.657
You train here?

13:34.692 --> 13:36.559
Yeah.

13:36.594 --> 13:37.994
It's Bucky DeMarco.

13:38.028 --> 13:40.162
I-I promoted one of your first
fights back in Victorville.

13:40.197 --> 13:41.597
- Bucky DeMarco.
- Yeah.

13:41.631 --> 13:44.400
Yeah. You fucked me out of 500 bucks.

13:44.434 --> 13:45.834
Really?

13:48.138 --> 13:49.205
Ah, well, it was like...

13:50.807 --> 13:54.076
Is, uh, Lisa here? 'Cause I had a meeting.

13:55.345 --> 13:57.445
Yeah, go ahead.

13:59.015 --> 14:01.249
She's in the back.

14:02.652 --> 14:05.487
Bucky, I'm just
fucking with you, man.

14:05.522 --> 14:07.155
She's in there.

14:07.189 --> 14:08.957
Yeah.

14:08.992 --> 14:10.792
Hmm.

14:16.265 --> 14:18.299
Mm.

14:18.334 --> 14:20.968
Oh, for God sakes, Bucky,
it's not a fucking riddle.

14:21.003 --> 14:22.904
Do you have a fight for Jay or not?

14:22.938 --> 14:25.706
To be honest with you, Lisa...

14:25.741 --> 14:27.575
I'm looking at another guy.

14:27.609 --> 14:29.877
Who are you gonna get
that's better than Jay?

14:29.912 --> 14:32.914
Jay's a name. He sells
tickets. He'll make his gate.

14:32.948 --> 14:36.951
Come on, Lisa. People talk.
He has a terrible reputation.

14:36.985 --> 14:38.352
So do you.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.789
I'm giving you a gift, Bucky.

14:41.823 --> 14:44.425
Jay classes up your show
the second he signs on.

14:44.459 --> 14:47.494
Don't shit the bed. Put him on the card.

14:47.529 --> 14:50.330
- All right, what's he fighting at?
- 155.

14:50.365 --> 14:53.733
Ooh. See, that's a problem,
then. 155's already taken.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.735
What spots do you have open?

14:55.770 --> 14:56.870
Welterweight.

14:56.904 --> 14:58.372
Who's the fighter?

14:58.406 --> 14:59.506
Ransom Galbi.

14:59.541 --> 15:00.941
Okay.

15:00.975 --> 15:02.943
Well, I'll talk to Jay,

15:02.977 --> 15:05.812
but if he says yes, then he's on the card.

15:05.846 --> 15:06.846
Yeah?

15:08.883 --> 15:10.817
Yeah, fuck, yeah!

15:10.851 --> 15:13.787
I love Jay, all right, but the
fight's only three days out.

15:13.821 --> 15:15.855
He's not gonna screw me on this, is he?

15:15.890 --> 15:17.557
No. He won't.

15:17.592 --> 15:19.992
You got a deal.

15:22.396 --> 15:24.964
Since he's the last fighter
in, there's not much money.

15:24.998 --> 15:27.032
No money? Bucky, I'm shocked.

15:29.570 --> 15:32.105
You've reached Jay.
Please fuck off after the beep.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.872
Jay, it's me.

15:33.907 --> 15:35.711
I've got something for you. Call me back.

15:37.310 --> 15:39.181
That was so good, honey. Thank you.

15:39.235 --> 15:40.609
Let me give you a ride.

15:40.644 --> 15:42.278
No, I'll walk. I'm okay.

15:42.313 --> 15:44.480
Come on. Let me just drive you.

15:44.514 --> 15:47.616
No, I ate too many chips.
It'll be good to walk.

15:47.651 --> 15:49.652
Mom...

15:49.686 --> 15:52.020
I need you to come with me.

15:52.055 --> 15:54.022
Just get in the truck.

15:54.057 --> 15:55.357
Come on. Mom... Mom...

15:55.391 --> 15:57.493
No, let go of me! Let go!

15:57.527 --> 15:59.562
Jay, let go of me!

16:04.300 --> 16:07.269
I'm so sorry, mom.

16:10.139 --> 16:12.674
Shh, shh. You're okay, mama.

16:16.545 --> 16:18.245
Hey, hey.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.881
Jay, Jay!

16:23.886 --> 16:25.453
- No, Jay!
- Shh!

16:27.289 --> 16:29.991
Hey, hey, hey, hey, relax.

16:30.025 --> 16:32.460
- No, no!
- Let go, let go!

16:32.495 --> 16:33.728
No!

16:33.762 --> 16:35.696
Mom.

16:35.730 --> 16:37.564
Shh! Shh!

16:37.599 --> 16:40.101
Jay! I'm gonna get sick!

16:40.135 --> 16:42.169
I'm gonna get so sick!

16:42.204 --> 16:46.140
Mom, you can get through
this. Okay? I fucking know it.

16:46.174 --> 16:48.309
Yes, you can, mom. Ma, I got you.

16:48.343 --> 16:49.710
Look at me.

16:49.744 --> 16:52.045
Hey, I got you.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.214
All right, I'm gonna take care of you.

16:54.248 --> 16:55.516
Oh, my God.

16:55.550 --> 16:57.283
Oh, just breathe.

16:57.318 --> 16:59.085
Oh, my God. Oh, my.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.555
Jay  please just let me go, okay?

17:01.589 --> 17:03.724
Okay, just let me go.
Let me go back, please.

17:03.758 --> 17:05.559
No, you're not going
anywhere until this shit is...

17:05.593 --> 17:07.693
- No, please. Please, baby.
- Mom, until this shit is through,

17:07.728 --> 17:09.595
y-you're not going anywhere, okay?

17:11.499 --> 17:15.667
I'm gonna check in on
you in a little while.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.970
So you just relax here, okay?

17:18.005 --> 17:19.571
Okay.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.441
No!

17:21.474 --> 17:23.009
I'm gonna check on you in a little bit.

17:23.044 --> 17:24.476
Who the fuck do you think you are?!

17:24.511 --> 17:26.579
Mom, hey, hey! No, you can't do this!

17:26.613 --> 17:28.414
- You... no, you can't do this!
- Shh!

17:28.448 --> 17:29.582
You can't do this!

17:29.616 --> 17:31.551
- You are gonna do this, mom!
- No!

17:31.585 --> 17:33.920
- You're gonna fucking do this!
- No! Shh!

17:33.954 --> 17:34.921
Agh!

17:34.955 --> 17:37.823
No, Jay, don't leave me in here!

17:42.895 --> 17:46.831
Fucking little asshole! Let me out of here!

17:46.866 --> 17:49.268
Jay!

18:21.533 --> 18:24.068
Aah!

18:29.108 --> 18:30.507
Aah!

18:34.779 --> 18:35.879
Aah!

18:57.602 --> 18:59.503
Your dad's pretty intense.

18:59.537 --> 19:01.704
Yeah, you could say that.

19:01.739 --> 19:03.305
Was he a fighter?

19:03.340 --> 19:04.406
Yeah.

19:04.441 --> 19:06.676
- Mr. Kulina?
- Hey.

19:06.710 --> 19:07.977
All right, so, it looks like

19:08.012 --> 19:10.079
the insurance is gonna
cover about six more visits,

19:10.114 --> 19:11.580
but that should be enough
'cause he's healing up nicely,

19:11.615 --> 19:12.849
so, um...

19:12.883 --> 19:16.119
Of course, if not, we can
always work something out.

19:16.153 --> 19:18.254
Yeah, it was pretty
different back then...

19:18.288 --> 19:20.722
no weight classes, no
regulation or anything,

19:20.757 --> 19:23.459
so it was... It was pretty savage.

19:23.493 --> 19:26.061
And now it's more of a sport.

19:26.095 --> 19:28.130
I can't picture you fighting.

19:28.165 --> 19:30.132
Why do you say that?

19:30.167 --> 19:32.635
I don't know. Just...

19:32.669 --> 19:35.103
You seem really sweet.

19:35.138 --> 19:37.706
He needs to be training
again as soon as possible.

19:37.740 --> 19:39.340
You have any idea when that will be?

19:39.375 --> 19:41.076
Well, he's responding well to treatment,

19:41.110 --> 19:42.878
but, you know, it's kind of hard to say.

19:42.912 --> 19:44.680
I mean, you don't have
a professional opinion?

19:46.315 --> 19:47.783
No offence.

19:47.817 --> 19:49.284
This guy just won a big fight,

19:49.318 --> 19:51.352
and he's got a lot of
heat on him right now.

19:51.387 --> 19:52.920
I don't want him to lose momentum.

19:52.954 --> 19:53.988
You understand that?

19:54.022 --> 19:56.524
I wish I could give you a date or time,

19:56.559 --> 19:58.926
but everybody's different, you know?

19:58.960 --> 20:02.163
Only Nate can let us know when he's ready.

20:02.198 --> 20:03.764
Hmm.

20:03.799 --> 20:06.301
Only Nate. Okay.

20:06.335 --> 20:09.536
So, do you do
anything else besides fighting?

20:09.571 --> 20:12.539
Uh, I sleep. I play video games.

20:12.574 --> 20:14.608
You know, once I said it out loud,

20:14.642 --> 20:16.711
I realize how sad that sounds.

20:16.745 --> 20:18.378
Yeah, it sounds very sad.

20:18.413 --> 20:21.048
Okay, I'm gonna think of a hobby for you

20:21.083 --> 20:22.583
'cause you need to get out in the world.

20:22.617 --> 20:24.952
You need a release in your life.

20:24.986 --> 20:27.354
Don't want to end up like your dad.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.524
This is Allison.

20:30.558 --> 20:32.259
Hi, Allison. It's Lisa Prince.

20:32.293 --> 20:35.061
Don't kill me. My
father sent the equipment.

20:35.096 --> 20:36.963
I told him you weren't interested.

20:36.997 --> 20:38.965
You've got to get this out of here today.

20:38.999 --> 20:40.400
We can't accept gifts.

20:40.435 --> 20:42.568
I was really fucking clear about that.

20:42.603 --> 20:43.937
You were, and I'm sorry.

20:43.971 --> 20:45.671
You're so not fucking hearing me.

20:45.706 --> 20:47.974
We need someone to come
and pick this up today.

20:48.008 --> 20:50.076
How about this? Have a
drink with me tonight.

20:50.111 --> 20:52.145
No business, one drink,

20:52.179 --> 20:55.514
and I promise to have the
equipment out before tomorrow.

20:56.884 --> 20:59.118
Lisa, still there?

20:59.152 --> 21:01.820
Yeah.

21:32.485 --> 21:33.985
You look better.

21:34.019 --> 21:35.052
Thanks.

21:35.087 --> 21:37.555
A long way to go.

21:37.590 --> 21:39.591
Right?

21:39.625 --> 21:42.894
Hey.

21:46.131 --> 21:48.232
watch out for Bucky DeMarco.

21:49.768 --> 21:50.935
Guy's a scumbag.

21:50.969 --> 21:53.171
This business is full of them.

21:54.273 --> 21:57.208
Is he still throwing
those horrible smokers?

21:57.242 --> 21:59.310
Fight's a fight.

21:59.344 --> 22:01.012
True.

22:01.046 --> 22:05.282
Can you... think you
can get me out of these?

22:05.317 --> 22:07.284
Please?

22:07.319 --> 22:09.787
Please.

22:12.857 --> 22:14.658
I just put Jay on his card.

22:16.194 --> 22:18.094
I guess, uh, beggars can't be choosers.

22:18.129 --> 22:19.896
Yeah, well, in typical Jay fashion,

22:19.931 --> 22:22.165
he's fallen off the
fucking face of the planet.

22:22.200 --> 22:25.601
Huh. Well, just like a fighter.

22:25.636 --> 22:28.638
Yeah.

22:30.741 --> 22:34.711
Anyway, uh, Alvey should be back soon.

22:34.745 --> 22:36.012
Hey, Lisa?

22:37.815 --> 22:39.549
Thank you.

22:39.583 --> 22:41.217
For what?

22:41.251 --> 22:44.019
For, uh, for letting me back in here.

22:44.054 --> 22:46.356
It means a lot, and I know it's not ideal.

22:46.390 --> 22:47.657
You could've said no.

22:47.691 --> 22:49.625
I did say no.

22:51.595 --> 22:54.396
Either way... It means a lot.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.500
Don't forget to clean up the mats.

23:00.536 --> 23:02.937
Put the phone away.

23:02.972 --> 23:04.172
Why?

23:04.206 --> 23:06.174
'Cause we're in a police
station. That's why.

23:10.312 --> 23:12.146
- Gentlemen.
- Detective.

23:12.181 --> 23:13.281
Thank you so much for coming down.

23:13.315 --> 23:14.849
Absolutely.

23:14.884 --> 23:16.351
We want to catch these guys.

23:16.385 --> 23:18.253
Listen, um, I'd love to talk to Nate alone

23:18.287 --> 23:19.587
if it'd be all right with you.

23:22.191 --> 23:23.557
You're good?

23:23.592 --> 23:24.725
Yeah.

23:24.760 --> 23:27.561
- I'll wait outside.
- Won't take but a second.

23:31.833 --> 23:35.436
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

23:35.470 --> 23:36.804
How's your brother?

23:36.838 --> 23:38.972
He's all right.

23:40.876 --> 23:42.576
You ever seen these guys,

23:42.611 --> 23:45.279
Carlos Cruz, Hector Romero?

23:45.313 --> 23:48.015
Venice 13 gang members.

23:48.049 --> 23:49.149
No, sir.

23:50.285 --> 23:51.684
You sure?

23:51.719 --> 23:53.820
Because a C.I. told me

23:53.854 --> 23:57.590
that they were bragging about
whipping some fighter's ass.

23:57.625 --> 24:00.994
Now, I did a bunch of math,
and I thought it might be you.

24:03.363 --> 24:06.433
- I don't know these guys.
- That's mysterious to me,

24:06.467 --> 24:09.368
'cause if somebody did to
me what they did to you...

24:09.403 --> 24:11.704
I would damn sure want
them to be accountable,

24:11.739 --> 24:14.874
unless I was covering for somebody.

24:16.644 --> 24:19.111
Son...

24:19.146 --> 24:23.249
I can't do my job if you won't talk to me.

24:25.618 --> 24:27.786
I don't know them. I'm sorry.

25:23.517 --> 25:25.384
This guy's trying to help you.

25:28.354 --> 25:30.456
All right, you and me
are having dinner tonight.

25:30.490 --> 25:33.025
- No, I can't.
- It's not an invitation.

25:33.059 --> 25:35.694
We're having dinner. I
got to swing by the gym.

25:35.729 --> 25:37.896
I want you to be at my house at 7:00.

25:37.931 --> 25:39.831
Do you understand?

25:48.507 --> 25:50.342
Jay!

26:00.953 --> 26:02.821
There you go.

26:02.855 --> 26:04.689
All right, just grab it.

26:06.725 --> 26:08.760
Make some space up there.

26:20.115 --> 26:22.282
You see Ryan?

26:22.317 --> 26:24.585
He left early.

26:24.620 --> 26:27.287
He gets picked up here.
Where the fuck did he go?

26:27.387 --> 26:28.222
I don't know.

26:28.322 --> 26:31.291
Maybe you should put a
chip in him like a puppy.

26:31.326 --> 26:33.861
Did you talk to him? How did he seem?

26:33.895 --> 26:35.630
He seemed fine.

26:35.664 --> 26:38.532
I was mostly in my office.

26:38.566 --> 26:40.167
- How'd it go with Nate?
- Not good.

26:40.201 --> 26:41.335
I think he's hiding something,

26:41.369 --> 26:43.103
and I think it has
something to do with Jay.

26:43.138 --> 26:44.704
I'm gonna have dinner with him tonight,

26:44.739 --> 26:45.905
see if I can pry it out of him.

26:45.940 --> 26:48.208
Well, just take it easy on him.

26:48.243 --> 26:50.076
He's been through a trauma.

26:50.111 --> 26:52.779
He should probably be in therapy.

26:52.813 --> 26:54.881
I'm just gonna have dinner and talk to him.

26:54.915 --> 26:57.184
Did Ryan say if he was coming back?

26:57.218 --> 26:59.152
He didn't say anything.

27:12.033 --> 27:17.036
Once a year, they fly me out
for this training seminar.

27:17.070 --> 27:20.873
It's two hours of demoralizing bullshit,

27:20.907 --> 27:26.011
but I get to spend three
days in the California sun.

27:26.046 --> 27:27.813
It's the best time of my year.

27:29.683 --> 27:32.350
What about you? You live around here?

27:32.385 --> 27:34.920
No, I-I live down in Manhattan Beach.

27:34.954 --> 27:37.756
My partners and I are
developing a commercial space

27:37.791 --> 27:39.524
here on Abbot Kinney.

27:39.559 --> 27:40.993
Oh. W-what is it?

27:41.027 --> 27:44.429
Mixed use... uh, lofts, condos,

27:44.463 --> 27:47.332
a few thousand square feet of retail space.

27:47.366 --> 27:50.235
Wow. Are you the architect?

27:50.269 --> 27:53.071
No.  No, God no.

27:53.105 --> 27:57.442
No, I wish I had that
talent, but I'm the money.

27:57.476 --> 28:00.778
Just push numbers around
until they make sense.

28:00.813 --> 28:05.316
It's so funny. Everyone out
here dresses so casually.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.118
I love it.

28:09.688 --> 28:14.759
I have to say, you look
really young to be in finance.

28:14.793 --> 28:18.295
The only rich guys I know wear suits.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.463
Look like shit.

28:19.497 --> 28:22.032
I got lucky with a few
things right out of school.

28:22.066 --> 28:24.101
- Where'd you go?
- Back east.

28:24.135 --> 28:26.036
Oh. One of those, huh?

28:28.039 --> 28:31.342
- What about you?
- Indiana Hoosier.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.476
Mm-hmm.

28:32.510 --> 28:35.112
Born there, raised there.

28:35.146 --> 28:37.681
Probably die there.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.984
Who knows? Maybe I'm already dead.

28:42.186 --> 28:44.855
I'm married.

28:45.957 --> 28:47.557
Where's the ring?

28:47.591 --> 28:49.259
I don't wear it when I come out here...

28:49.293 --> 28:51.527
reminds me of my husband.

28:51.562 --> 28:53.363
Ouch.

28:53.397 --> 28:55.197
Uh...

28:55.232 --> 28:57.533
We've been together since high school.

28:57.568 --> 29:00.903
He's... he's a good man, but
he's... he's not a great man.

29:00.937 --> 29:04.240
He would hate it out here.
He calls it Hollyweird.

29:04.275 --> 29:07.443
"Have fun out in Hollyweird
with all the fruitcakes."

29:07.478 --> 29:09.979
It's not even Hollywood,
you ignorant hayseed.

29:10.013 --> 29:12.114
It's Venice and Santa Monica.

29:12.149 --> 29:14.116
He doesn't know the difference.

29:14.151 --> 29:18.120
I mean, the man could try harder.

29:18.155 --> 29:20.122
He...

29:20.157 --> 29:23.959
He doesn't know the first thing about me.

29:25.195 --> 29:29.230
Even a beautiful woman
gets taken for granted.

29:29.265 --> 29:32.534
What about you? You have a girlfriend?

29:34.771 --> 29:38.707
I was engaged, but...
It wasn't meant to be.

29:38.741 --> 29:41.576
- Who left?
- She did.

29:41.611 --> 29:44.179
I should've tried harder.

29:44.213 --> 29:46.781
She must have a screw loose.

29:51.787 --> 29:54.088
Goddamn, I'm older than you.

29:54.123 --> 29:56.124
Goddamn.

29:56.158 --> 29:58.259
Melanie, it's... it's Melanie, right?

29:58.294 --> 30:00.361
Good boy... you remembered.

30:00.395 --> 30:02.229
So, Melanie...

30:02.263 --> 30:04.665
We don't have ages in Los Angeles.

30:04.700 --> 30:07.501
If you're fucking hot, you're fucking hot.

30:10.205 --> 30:13.073
Oh, God! Oh, God! Fuck!

30:13.107 --> 30:14.975
Geez! Oh, geez, yes!

30:15.009 --> 30:16.577
Oh, fuck, fuck!

30:16.611 --> 30:18.245
Oh, geez! Yes!

30:18.279 --> 30:19.880
Ah, yes!

30:19.914 --> 30:21.448
Ah, what?!

30:21.482 --> 30:23.884
Don't stop! Don't stop! Fuck, fuck!

30:23.918 --> 30:25.652
Oh, fuck me!

30:25.686 --> 30:27.287
Fuck! Yes!

30:27.322 --> 30:29.356
Oh, fuck! Oh, shit!

30:29.390 --> 30:31.491
You have a lot of tattoos. You're...

30:31.525 --> 30:33.793
you work in finance?!

30:33.828 --> 30:35.595
Are you... oh, fuck! Oh!

30:35.629 --> 30:36.796
Oh!

30:36.831 --> 30:38.431
Oh!

30:38.466 --> 30:40.298
Oh, oh!

30:40.333 --> 30:43.034
Oh! Ah!

30:43.069 --> 30:45.203
Oh, ah, ah!

30:45.238 --> 30:47.072
Oh! Oh!

31:01.988 --> 31:04.055
Chrissy?

31:06.192 --> 31:09.027
Christina, where the fuck are you?

31:14.833 --> 31:16.300
Agh!

31:16.334 --> 31:18.035
Aah! Ohh!

31:18.069 --> 31:19.437
Whoa! The fuck!

31:19.471 --> 31:21.506
See? Shit, I got it!

31:22.808 --> 31:24.442
I remember where you kept it

31:24.476 --> 31:26.911
from when you had your
hands on my mom's tits.

31:26.945 --> 31:29.179
Man, I don't have your fucking mom!

31:29.214 --> 31:31.248
I know. I do.

31:31.283 --> 31:34.151
Just keep her, man. I don't need her, okay?

31:34.185 --> 31:35.852
What, is she disposable to you?

31:35.887 --> 31:38.155
- No, man, she's fucking great.
- She's great.

31:38.189 --> 31:39.924
She's great at
what... sucking dick for money?

31:39.958 --> 31:41.125
Is that what you mean?

31:41.159 --> 31:43.093
Is she great at being a great little whore?

31:43.128 --> 31:45.362
Man, I don't fucking know!

31:54.171 --> 31:56.306
Yeah.

31:56.340 --> 31:57.874
Yeah.

32:00.778 --> 32:02.378
Oh, fuck.

32:04.481 --> 32:06.816
I'm not gonna shoot you, Terry.

32:06.850 --> 32:08.217
Oh, fuck, thank...

32:08.252 --> 32:10.219
Oh, Jesus.

32:10.254 --> 32:12.455
Christ...Thank you.

32:17.061 --> 32:19.562
But you're gonna wish I did.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.198
Fuck! Ohh!

32:26.235 --> 32:27.803
Ohh!

32:30.440 --> 32:32.475
Fuck.

32:34.678 --> 32:36.244
Fuck.

32:36.279 --> 32:37.579
Ohh!

32:37.613 --> 32:39.281
Agh!

32:43.119 --> 32:44.252
Agh!

32:52.528 --> 32:55.497
Fuck!

33:05.240 --> 33:07.909
Get me out of here!

33:07.943 --> 33:10.177
I'm gonna die in here!

33:11.980 --> 33:13.614
Let her out.

33:13.648 --> 33:14.822
Fucking let her out, Jay!

33:14.917 --> 33:16.610
You know how long it
took me to make that door?

33:16.615 --> 33:18.095
Oh, fuck off! This isn't cool.

33:18.453 --> 33:19.320
Hey, that reminds me.

33:19.327 --> 33:21.366
We can't have any friends
over for a little bit.

33:21.368 --> 33:22.380
No, I don't want her in this house.

33:22.425 --> 33:23.365
I don't want her in this house!

33:23.392 --> 33:24.880
She's your mother, Nate.

33:25.827 --> 33:27.728
Let me out of here!

33:27.762 --> 33:29.066
You think I did this
because I had a choice.

33:29.081 --> 33:30.060
It's two fucking things.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.386
It's this, or it's mom getting...

33:32.600 --> 33:35.068
Shot up with dope and
gutterfucked for a nickel.

33:36.102 --> 33:37.338
Your mother.

33:38.472 --> 33:40.441
Your mother, Nate.

33:44.345 --> 33:46.446
We're doing this.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.748
So don't go near that door.

33:48.782 --> 33:50.518
Don't talk to her if she
starts yelling at you.

33:52.753 --> 33:54.187
She's dope-sick.

33:54.221 --> 33:56.689
Put your earphones in,

33:56.723 --> 34:00.426
'cause she's gonna say fucking anything

34:00.460 --> 34:02.327
to get out of there.

34:04.698 --> 34:07.499
But when she comes through this...

34:07.534 --> 34:10.469
You're gonna see who she really is.

35:26.377 --> 35:28.278
Huh. Where have you been, playboy?

35:28.313 --> 35:31.258
I-I went for a run, man.
I wanted to get outside.

35:31.297 --> 35:35.200
- You've been drinking.
- A little.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.735
Little.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.937
I ain't your daddy.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.439
I don't want you to fuck this up.

35:42.473 --> 35:43.640
No, I won't.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.676
Trust me, man, I... I
pissed clean this morning,

35:45.711 --> 35:46.711
so I'm good for a bit.

35:46.745 --> 35:47.712
All right.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.680
What'd you drink?

35:49.715 --> 35:52.516
Best fucking beer I've ever had in my life.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.818
I bet.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.819
You'd have drank a
frosted glass of rat piss

35:55.853 --> 35:58.322
after the workout I saw you give there.

35:58.356 --> 36:00.557
I was watching the security tapes.

36:00.592 --> 36:01.958
You can do that?

36:01.992 --> 36:04.060
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.562
Knows all, sees all.

36:07.131 --> 36:08.365
Yeah.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.500
This is me.

36:12.737 --> 36:14.771
Be good.

36:16.140 --> 36:18.141
Oh, shit. You wanted to tell me something.

36:18.175 --> 36:19.475
What was that?

36:19.509 --> 36:21.911
Garo Kassabian wants you to
headline the king beast card.

36:21.946 --> 36:23.246
- Shit.
- Shit. Yeah.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.314
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.583
I mean, do I want a
fucking tuneup fight first?

36:27.618 --> 36:30.319
Absolutely. But I don't think
we can say no to this, man.

36:30.354 --> 36:32.488
You win this, you are back in the mix.

36:32.522 --> 36:34.557
It feels like I don't know my
ass from a hole in the ground

36:34.591 --> 36:35.924
right now, Alvey.

36:35.959 --> 36:38.861
You are not as far away as
you think you are, brother.

36:38.895 --> 36:41.764
Okay, now we got a real
thing to build a camp around.

36:41.798 --> 36:43.866
You're not ready, I
pull you out. I yank you.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.067
- Really?
- Hand to heart.

36:45.101 --> 36:46.769
I'm not gonna put you in a bad fight.

36:49.139 --> 36:51.106
Hey, let's go!

36:51.141 --> 36:53.608
If you think it's the right move, I'm in.

36:53.643 --> 36:55.878
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you're the boss.

36:55.912 --> 36:57.479
My man.

37:01.884 --> 37:04.852
We'll get after it tomorrow, okay?

37:04.887 --> 37:05.953
Yes, sir.

37:13.429 --> 37:16.898
Is it weird being the flower
in a business of brutes?

37:16.932 --> 37:19.600
You know, I can be a pretty hard bitch.

37:19.634 --> 37:21.269
But you know what I'm saying.

37:21.303 --> 37:23.570
It's not a woman's world traditionally.

37:23.605 --> 37:25.206
How'd you end up here?

37:25.240 --> 37:27.909
I think I just kind of fell into it.

37:27.943 --> 37:33.181
Ryan and I were engaged,
so his world became mine.

37:33.215 --> 37:34.848
That's the story I want to know.

37:34.882 --> 37:37.685
It's too long to tell.

37:37.719 --> 37:39.486
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

37:39.521 --> 37:41.355
No, it's fine.

37:41.389 --> 37:45.426
But besides that, something
kept you in this business.

37:45.460 --> 37:47.695
It's, um, like a family.

37:47.729 --> 37:50.497
I don't know. I...

37:50.532 --> 37:52.833
I'm not gonna write a fashion blog

37:52.867 --> 37:56.203
or go into pharmaceuticals
or whatever the fuck it is

37:56.237 --> 37:58.304
that women are supposed to do.

37:58.338 --> 38:00.873
I was always that kid that
when Christmas came along,

38:00.907 --> 38:03.775
my brothers would get slingshots
and I would get a baby doll,

38:03.810 --> 38:06.045
and it would drive me fucking insane.

38:06.079 --> 38:07.479
Yes. I have three bothers.

38:07.513 --> 38:09.414
I'm like, "give me the damn slingshot.

38:09.449 --> 38:11.416
You guys don't even know how to use it."

38:11.451 --> 38:13.319
- And that never changes.
- Exactly.

38:14.654 --> 38:17.622
You know, I told my father we
shouldn't send the equipment.

38:17.657 --> 38:19.324
"Lisa doesn't want it."

38:19.359 --> 38:21.192
He's old school. He...

38:21.227 --> 38:23.395
He thinks girls like shiny things.

38:23.429 --> 38:24.863
It's fine.

38:24.897 --> 38:27.298
It's all gone, so...

38:31.770 --> 38:34.572
Alvey seems like a handful.

38:34.606 --> 38:38.243
He can be, but it's his gym.

38:38.277 --> 38:40.478
Don't you run it?

38:42.248 --> 38:46.584
Okay, Allison... You're
getting nowhere with me.

38:46.618 --> 38:50.454
I don't take money or favors
from people in your business.

38:50.489 --> 38:52.623
You got this all wrong.

38:52.657 --> 38:55.693
Oh, no, no. I don't give a
shit what your father does

38:55.727 --> 38:57.127
or how he makes his money.

38:57.161 --> 38:58.462
Honestly, I don't judge.

38:58.497 --> 39:00.498
Fuck, I've probably even smoked it,

39:00.532 --> 39:02.633
but it's not flowing through our gym.

39:02.667 --> 39:05.168
So let's just have a good evening

39:05.203 --> 39:08.772
like a couple of fucking
flowers, call it a night.

39:13.011 --> 39:16.046
To working with difficult men.

39:24.165 --> 39:27.400
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.721
Okay.

39:40.022 --> 39:42.057
What are we gonna do about this?

39:42.091 --> 39:43.625
About what?

39:43.660 --> 39:45.861
You're not talking to me.

39:45.895 --> 39:47.996
You're not talking to the police.

39:48.030 --> 39:50.598
Why do I have to talk about anything?

39:50.632 --> 39:52.834
This happened to me.

39:52.869 --> 39:55.770
Because a lot of people
care about you, Nate.

39:55.804 --> 39:58.039
And these people need to be punished.

39:58.074 --> 39:59.107
That's why.

39:59.141 --> 40:00.976
But what if I just want to let it go?

40:01.010 --> 40:04.212
This have anything to do
with your brother? Does it?

40:06.682 --> 40:08.750
You want to know the truth?

40:08.784 --> 40:10.117
Yeah.

40:10.151 --> 40:11.419
Okay.

40:11.453 --> 40:13.821
When those guys were
fucking stomping on my head,

40:13.856 --> 40:15.890
they did say something.

40:15.924 --> 40:18.993
They said, "tell your
dad we said, 'what's up?'"

40:21.196 --> 40:22.562
what does that mean?

40:22.597 --> 40:24.765
Huh?

40:24.799 --> 40:27.434
The truth is that I
don't even fucking care.

40:27.468 --> 40:29.036
I just want it to go away.

40:29.070 --> 40:32.940
And I want you to go away
and leave me the fuck alone.

40:34.309 --> 40:36.343
- Nate...
- Stay away from me.

40:36.378 --> 40:38.512
You owe me that.

40:38.546 --> 40:40.547
Nate...

40:40.581 --> 40:42.616
Son?

41:27.828 --> 41:30.429
Why are you doing this to me?

41:52.150 --> 41:53.785
Hi.

41:53.819 --> 41:56.020
Where have you been all day?

41:56.054 --> 41:57.622
Um, deep in prayer.

41:58.757 --> 42:01.492
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

42:01.526 --> 42:03.494
Why the fuck haven't you called me back?

42:03.528 --> 42:06.063
As I said, I was deep in prayer.

42:06.098 --> 42:08.765
You know what? I don't even care.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.234
I got you a fight.

42:12.437 --> 42:16.440
- Who's the promoter?
- Bucky DeMarco.

42:17.476 --> 42:19.042
Oh, wait, it gets worse.

42:19.076 --> 42:21.845
It's a welterweight... Ransom Galbi.

42:21.880 --> 42:25.115
- When?
- Three days.

42:25.149 --> 42:27.217
How much?

42:27.251 --> 42:29.119
Jack shit and a piece of your gate.

42:29.153 --> 42:31.087
- How big a piece?
- A sliver.

42:31.122 --> 42:32.188
Where?

42:32.223 --> 42:34.224
He doesn't have a place yet,

42:34.258 --> 42:37.660
but it will definitely
be sad and depressing.

42:37.694 --> 42:42.165
So, it's three days out...
And he doesn't have a venue?

42:42.199 --> 42:44.267
He has a cage. He has a tent.

42:44.301 --> 42:46.002
He just needs a place to put it.

42:46.037 --> 42:50.507
Sounds like a great opportunity,
but I think I'm gonna pass.

42:50.541 --> 42:52.341
Jay, I called everyone,

42:52.375 --> 42:55.411
and Bucky's the only one
who would give us a fight.

42:55.445 --> 42:58.047
Everyone
thinks you're a head case.

42:58.081 --> 43:00.983
Yeah, I may be, but I don't need
to take it in the fucking ass

43:01.018 --> 43:02.718
from a douche like Bucky.

43:02.753 --> 43:06.589
Oh, no, you're taking it in
the ass if you want to fight.

43:06.623 --> 43:09.558
That's where you're at.

43:09.592 --> 43:12.461
If you think that there's gonna be
something better that's gonna come along,

43:12.495 --> 43:15.630
I'm here to tell you that it's not.

43:15.665 --> 43:17.366
It's this or nothing.

43:23.506 --> 43:26.307
You got tape on this guy?

43:26.341 --> 43:27.876
You'll have it by tomorrow.

43:27.910 --> 43:31.279
I'm gonna be at the gym tomorrow
morning pretty early... ish.

43:31.313 --> 43:33.949
Probably around noon.

43:33.983 --> 43:35.083
Bring it.

43:35.117 --> 43:36.618
Hey.

43:36.652 --> 43:37.986
You okay?

43:38.020 --> 43:39.287
Yeah.

44:07.782 --> 44:10.383
You made it! Hi!

44:10.418 --> 44:11.685
Come, I want you to meet some people.
