12:37.791 --> 12:40.391
While speedy was in it
with his gangster friends,

12:40.393 --> 12:42.794
We would have sent him back
to prison already.

There were four people murdered
last night.

13:34.815 --> 13:38.016
Was rolled down -- it was shot
through with bullets.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.517
Which means the driver
fired the murder weapon,

And there was no one
in the front seat with him.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.154

Provenza: Julio's right.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.455
This is sounding less and less
like gangs.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.691
So, speedy got out of prison
last week

You ever have anyone
in your life

19:01.508 --> 19:05.576
That you really cared about
just not show up?

19:05.578 --> 19:09.680
And leave you hanging?

19:09.682 --> 19:12.316
It's not like that.

19:12.318 --> 19:15.086
Oh, but it is.

19:15.088 --> 19:17.855
It's exactly like that.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.259
[ knock on door ]

19:21.261 --> 19:23.694
We found some problems
at browning security.

19:29.801 --> 19:32.870
Turns out there was a missing
girlfriend in the mix.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.305
Whose girlfriend?

19:34.307 --> 19:35.973
Flynn: Hold on a second.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.009
We're playing a game called
"how stupid do you think I am?"

19:38.011 --> 19:40.511
Oh, I love this game.
Go, go, go, go, go.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.613
But you have to keep track
of coincidences.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.514
I'll do that.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.549
Flynn: Okay.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.883
Here's ron browning,

19:45.885 --> 19:48.352
The man whose name
speedy recognized

19:48.354 --> 19:50.855
And the owner of...
Young man.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.690
Browning security --
the same company

19:52.692 --> 19:54.659
That reported a tahoe stolen
before the shooting.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.661
That's a...Coincidence.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.662
We're at one.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.397
Sykes: Four years ago,

19:59.399 --> 20:01.465
Mr. Browning was supervising
independent security contractors

20:01.467 --> 20:02.800
At our embassy
in afghanistan

20:02.802 --> 20:04.402
When his fiancée
disappeared.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.804
And that would be
melissa orr, 26.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.473
Tao: Now, according
to missing persons,

20:09.475 --> 20:13.177
Mr. Browning gave melissa an
engagement ring worth $65,000,

20:13.179 --> 20:14.812
Which browning wanted back

20:14.814 --> 20:16.881
After melissa called off
the wedding.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.850
She called off the wedding?
While browning was overseas?

20:19.852 --> 20:21.185
Just before he left.

20:21.187 --> 20:22.853
He tried to work it out
from kabul,

20:22.855 --> 20:25.156
But then melissa went missing
and now is presumed dead.

20:25.158 --> 20:27.525
So browning's name pops up
next to another murder.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.360
What a...Coincidence.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.661
That's two.

20:30.663 --> 20:33.998
Okay, so, guess
who javier reyes,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.334
A.K.A. Speedy,
used to work for?

20:36.336 --> 20:38.669
A shot in the dark --
browning security.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.504
That's coincidence
number three.

20:40.506 --> 20:43.941
Browning employs lots
of former third streeters

20:43.943 --> 20:47.044
On his local security teams,
but no locos.

20:47.046 --> 20:49.513
Means he knows how gangs
in that neighborhood work.

that's four.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.516

Almost a month before
speedy got out of prison,

20:54.621 --> 20:56.120
Browning left town

20:56.122 --> 21:00.591
And went to a friend's house
living in...Morro bay.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.862
Could browning's friend

21:04.864 --> 21:08.232
Be our marine
with the missing kg-99?

21:08.234 --> 21:09.600
<i>The</i> same.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.603
Coincidence number six.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.373
What do you think, captain?
Is browning our guy?

21:15.375 --> 21:17.475
Was he trying
to kill speedy,

21:17.477 --> 21:20.711
Or have we merely been
documenting the role of chance

21:20.713 --> 21:21.812
In the universe?

21:21.814 --> 21:23.247
Before we go down that road,

21:23.249 --> 21:24.749
I've got to figure out a way

To get mr. Browning in here

Thank you so much
for helping us.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.398
Finding your tahoe is gonna
turn out to be a lot easier

21:40.400 --> 21:41.832
Than getting it back
to you.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.567
That's understandable,
considering.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.970
Could you step into our
visitors' conference center

21:45.972 --> 21:47.238
For a moment?

21:47.240 --> 21:48.506
We have a lot
of paperwork waiting.

Hey.

I know it looks like a lot,
but we'll help you with it.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.745
Have a seat.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.581
First, even though
you're the victim,

21:57.583 --> 21:59.517
This is a criminal matter

21:59.519 --> 22:01.852
Since the car was used
in several homicides.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.155
So you have to initial
the miranda warning,

22:04.157 --> 22:06.290
And then below that
there's a statement

22:06.292 --> 22:08.292

the primary owner.

<i>Most of that pile is required</i>
<i>by the insurance companies.</i>

Taylor: Remember, until
we can prove otherwise,

22:16.035 --> 22:18.636
Even when it's not gangs,
it's gangs.

wanted to keep it.

Melissa mailed the ring

23:47.894 --> 23:50.060
Of course it's not

And you people would actually

24:22.093 --> 24:23.928

your fiancée now

Or after you're arraigned
for the murder

Of the last woman
you asked to marry you?

24:29.901 --> 24:32.069
Jack:
Just for argument's sake,

24:32.071 --> 24:34.238
Let's examine this theory
of yours.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.240
Let's say browning
paid my client

24:36.242 --> 24:39.310
To off his fiancée
four years ago,

24:39.312 --> 24:41.178
But then javier
gets out of prison,

24:41.180 --> 24:42.513
And browning gets worried,

24:42.515 --> 24:46.283
So he tries
to kill my client

24:46.285 --> 24:49.019
To prevent him from cooperating
with the l.A.P.D.

24:49.021 --> 24:52.823
Why shoot up a gas station
and all those other people?!

24:52.825 --> 24:55.759
To disguise his intention.

24:55.761 --> 24:58.462
Make the attack on speedy
look like gangs!

24:58.464 --> 24:59.997
Okay.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.600
Hypothetically, let's say
you're right about all this.

25:02.602 --> 25:07.204
What would be the offer
to my client?

25:07.206 --> 25:09.006
If he confirms browning paid him
to kill his fiancée,

25:09.008 --> 25:10.374
Speedy would get
second-degree murder,

25:10.376 --> 25:11.842

25:11.844 --> 25:13.143
Well, you know,
that's a little steep

evidence here.

25:26.292 --> 25:29.560
How do you know
we don't have her body yet?

25:29.562 --> 25:32.863
Did javier
tell you that, jack?

25:35.300 --> 25:39.003
I know it because you haven't
arrested javier for murder,

25:39.005 --> 25:41.839
And that would be
pretty hard to do,

25:41.841 --> 25:45.142
Seeing as how you would have to
provide the victim's body

26:15.341 --> 26:17.341
He's your motive in the shooting
at the gas station.

a manslaughter plea.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.757

27:58.843 --> 28:01.478
Now he has no attorney at all.
How do we talk to him?

28:01.480 --> 28:03.113
Give us a moment.

28:03.115 --> 28:06.350
There's a ritual involved
with suspects like this,

28:06.352 --> 28:08.152
And we need to follow it.

28:08.154 --> 28:09.787
Ah. Come.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.625
Rusty,
go to the break room.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.329
Rusty: [ sighs ]
oh, jack.

28:19.331 --> 28:20.531
Uh, any ideas for me?

28:20.533 --> 28:22.633
Not now!

28:22.635 --> 28:23.801
Later.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.536
Okay.

28:26.738 --> 28:29.073
I want to see that video
of javier's interrogation

28:29.075 --> 28:30.708
Before I leave here.

28:30.710 --> 28:32.743
I will <i>not</i> let you trample
that man's civil rights

28:32.745 --> 28:34.411
In order for you
to get what you need.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.480
Sit. Wait.

28:36.482 --> 28:39.817
We'll get back to you after
we've <i>burned</i> the constitution.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.987
Like you really care.

28:48.693 --> 28:50.260
No questions.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.730
Right.

28:52.732 --> 28:55.265
Javier, we're not allowed
to interview you,

28:55.267 --> 28:57.067
But there's two things
you should know.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.103
First, we're about to search
your neighborhood

28:59.105 --> 29:01.672
For all the places that you
could have buried melissa orr,

29:01.674 --> 29:03.841
Paying special attention
to your former addresses

29:03.843 --> 29:05.175
And homes
of family members.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.177
And, secondly,
whatever your relationship

29:07.179 --> 29:10.581
With browning used to be,
he doesn't like you anymore.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.684
<i>It's gonna take days</i>
<i>for the courts</i>

29:13.686 --> 29:15.219
<i>To find someone</i>
<i>to defend you</i>

29:15.221 --> 29:16.887
<i>Since this is</i>
<i>a death-penalty case.</i>

29:16.889 --> 29:18.188
Death?

29:18.190 --> 29:19.957
Well, c-can't you help me?

29:19.959 --> 29:21.892
Not if you invoke
your rights.

29:21.894 --> 29:24.528
What if --
what if I gave up my rights?

29:25.597 --> 29:27.631
Well,
if you cooperate now,

29:27.633 --> 29:29.466
The d.A. Has already agreed

29:29.468 --> 29:31.769
<i>To give you a deal</i>
<i>for second-degree murder,</i>

29:31.771 --> 29:32.936
<i>17 to life.</i>

29:32.938 --> 29:34.605
So you have a parole date.

29:34.607 --> 29:37.040
Of course,
if you didn't kill melissa,

29:37.042 --> 29:38.475
Then you're okay.

29:38.477 --> 29:42.546
Maybe you don't care
about doing what's right,

29:42.548 --> 29:46.049
But maybe your relationship
with christ

29:46.051 --> 29:47.918
Was like a joke that you played
to get out of prison!

29:47.920 --> 29:49.319
It's not a joke!

29:49.321 --> 29:51.622
Christ is the only thing
that matters in my life!

29:51.624 --> 29:54.291
<i>The bible says it.</i>
<i>Look it up.</i>

29:54.293 --> 29:56.393
Even if speedy
admits to murder for hire,

29:56.395 --> 29:58.562
He'll still have to prove
browning paid him.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.597
Or the gas station case
all falls apart.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.166
What about the weapon
we found

30:02.168 --> 30:04.334
That belonged to browning's
friend in morro bay?

30:04.336 --> 30:06.436
Two years from now?
The jury will <i>love</i> that.

30:06.438 --> 30:09.139
Taylor: No.
We need to settle this today,

30:09.141 --> 30:12.276
Before the sun goes down
and the gangs start shooting.

30:12.278 --> 30:13.944
Javier: <i>He forgives me.</i>

30:13.946 --> 30:18.182
Jesus forgives me because
I put him first in everything.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.818
So, why...

30:22.287 --> 30:24.922
...Why did god kill
my little brother

30:24.924 --> 30:29.860
When <i>I</i> was the one
who did wrong?

30:30.995 --> 30:33.163
Why did god do that?

30:33.165 --> 30:35.766
No.

30:35.768 --> 30:37.100
Javier...

30:37.102 --> 30:41.839
God didn't kill
your brother.

30:41.841 --> 30:44.541
Ron browning did that.

30:46.311 --> 30:47.945
Maybe your brother died

30:47.947 --> 30:50.681
Because you didn't do what you
know christ wants you to do.

30:50.683 --> 30:53.450
And other people
could die now, too.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.385
Your old
third streeters, locos,

30:55.387 --> 30:57.387
Maybe even innocent kids
just walking to school!

30:57.389 --> 30:59.389
Wait, wait.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.891
Mnh-mnh.

31:00.893 --> 31:07.164
Christ forgives us, javier,
not judges and lawyers.

31:07.166 --> 31:10.701
You really want me
to get you an attorney,

31:10.703 --> 31:12.736
Or do you want to get right
with god?

31:12.738 --> 31:16.707
'cause sometimes it is not
possible to do both.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.208
Sanchez: Think about it.

31:19.844 --> 31:22.312
I-I mean
really think about it,

31:22.314 --> 31:26.717
'cause I promise you right now
browning is thinking about you.

31:34.926 --> 31:37.527
Lawyers never did anything
for me.

31:37.529 --> 31:40.097
I don't want a lawyer.
[ sniffles ]

31:40.099 --> 31:42.833
I want to do
what you said.

31:42.835 --> 31:44.701
I want to do right.

31:44.703 --> 31:48.839
Let's get the worst part of
this out of the way right now.

31:48.841 --> 31:51.174
Did you hurt melissa
before killing her?

31:51.176 --> 31:52.609
Did you knock her around?

31:52.611 --> 31:54.077
No, no, no.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.879
Did you rape her?
No!

31:55.881 --> 31:57.347
<i>I'm not like that!</i>
<i>I was never like that!</i>

31:57.349 --> 32:00.117
<i>That's --</i>
<i>don't make me like that.</i>

32:00.119 --> 32:01.551
Javier, look at me.

32:01.553 --> 32:05.789
Don't think about the person
that you used to be.

32:05.791 --> 32:09.426
Think about the person
that you are now.

32:09.428 --> 32:13.597
And start by telling us
where melissa is

32:13.599 --> 32:15.599
So we can get her back home
to her family.

32:27.812 --> 32:31.281
She's underneath the flower bed
in my grandmother's backyard.

32:32.817 --> 32:34.551
[ <i>sniffles</i> ]

32:34.553 --> 32:36.820
With every word
that you speak...
[ chuckles ]

32:36.822 --> 32:38.755
Well,
I'm leaving this revival.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.324
Go get a warrant

32:40.326 --> 32:43.560
And a crew with shovels
over to granny's house.

32:43.562 --> 32:46.396
[ door opens ]

32:46.398 --> 32:47.731
Sanchez: <i>Tell us</i>
<i>how you killed melissa.</i>

32:47.733 --> 32:48.765
[ door closes ]

32:48.767 --> 32:50.634
I...

32:52.337 --> 32:56.006
I s-- I strangled her.

32:57.108 --> 32:58.742
[ sniffles ]

32:58.744 --> 33:00.911
I strangled her
with the necklace

33:00.913 --> 33:02.312
That she was wearing.

33:04.582 --> 33:08.018
Cut off the finger
with the ring on it.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.790
[ <i>crying</i> ]
<i>then I buried her.</i>

33:13.792 --> 33:15.325
[ <i>sniffles</i> ]

33:16.594 --> 33:20.831
I was different then.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.869
I'm sorry.

33:28.339 --> 33:31.842
I'm sorry that I did that.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.347
Emma: At this stage,

33:37.349 --> 33:38.782
I won't be able to get a time
of death on melissa.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.050
She could have sent the ring
back to browning

33:40.052 --> 33:41.518
<i>Before</i> she was killed.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.020
Without absolute proof,

33:43.022 --> 33:45.489
It's javier's word
against browning's.

33:45.491 --> 33:48.492
What arrangement did
mr. Browning make with you?

33:48.494 --> 33:52.129
Did he pay you
to kill melissa?

33:52.131 --> 33:53.563
Is that it?

33:53.565 --> 33:57.834
He had to fire me
because I got arrested.

33:57.836 --> 34:00.737
D.U.I.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.140
But he said
that he'd pay me $10,000...

34:04.709 --> 34:06.543
...If I got rid
of his girlfriend.

34:06.545 --> 34:10.080
<i>And that he wanted me to mail</i>
<i>her ring back to him.</i>

34:10.082 --> 34:12.649
<i>Overseas or something.</i>

34:15.319 --> 34:17.354
Is there anything else
we should know?

34:17.356 --> 34:20.557
You have to
tell us everything.

34:25.663 --> 34:28.598
[ sniffles ]
I stole from browning.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.838
I stole from him.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.074
What'd you steal?

34:39.077 --> 34:40.277
[ knock on door ]

34:40.279 --> 34:41.344
Taylor: Come in.

34:44.782 --> 34:46.516
Flynn: Kathy thompson,

34:46.518 --> 34:49.686
Assistant chief of police
russell taylor,

34:49.688 --> 34:53.356
Captain sharon raydor,
lieutenant michael tao,

34:53.358 --> 34:55.225
And detective amy sykes.

34:55.227 --> 34:57.127
And you know
your fiancée, ron.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.728
Ron, what is going on?

34:58.730 --> 35:00.464
Don't stress out.
This will be over in a minute.

35:00.466 --> 35:03.233
I apologize for the crowd,
miss thompson,

35:03.235 --> 35:04.701
And our hurry,

35:04.703 --> 35:08.271
But we're trying to avoid
a gang war.

35:08.273 --> 35:11.141
And the sooner we can take
a look at your engagement ring,

35:11.143 --> 35:12.609
The faster all this
can be done.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.044
My ring?

35:14.046 --> 35:15.579
Ron, why do they need
to see my ring?

35:15.581 --> 35:18.281
Because the l.A.P.D.
Just dug up the last woman

35:18.283 --> 35:21.384
Who was wearing it from
underneath a row of hollyhocks.

35:21.386 --> 35:23.153
Melissa's dead?
Yes.

35:23.155 --> 35:25.222
And the man who killed her

35:25.224 --> 35:28.658
Claims that your fiancé
paid him to do it.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.460
In fact, if we can verify
the ring you're wearing

35:30.462 --> 35:34.397
Is the same one ron gave
melissa, the two of you can go.

35:34.399 --> 35:37.834
Javier, a.K.A. Speedy,
tells us

35:37.836 --> 35:39.402
That he was
supposed to mail

35:39.404 --> 35:42.339
This extremely pricey ring
back to you.

35:42.341 --> 35:46.343
Which technically
he failed to do.

35:46.345 --> 35:52.582
Sorry, kathy,
but maybe this is for the best.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.351
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell are you doing?

35:54.353 --> 35:56.453
You can't keep my ring!

35:56.455 --> 35:57.687
You're trying to rob me!

35:57.689 --> 35:59.089
We're too late
for that, sir.

35:59.091 --> 36:01.458
After speedy killed melissa

36:01.460 --> 36:03.160
And before he sent you back
this ring,

36:03.162 --> 36:05.128
He and a friend took it
to a jeweler downtown

36:05.130 --> 36:07.330
And replaced all the diamonds
with cubic zirconium.

36:07.332 --> 36:10.000
That's what all these
little sparkly stones

36:10.002 --> 36:11.668
In the setting are made of.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.670
Sharon: And that means
that we can corroborate

36:13.672 --> 36:17.007
Javier's confession
of murder for hire.

36:17.009 --> 36:20.644
And your motive for killing
four innocent people yesterday,

36:20.646 --> 36:22.112
Because you're
a depraved animal.

36:22.114 --> 36:24.447
Ron browning,
you're under arrest

36:24.449 --> 36:26.483
For five counts of murder
in the first degree

36:26.485 --> 36:27.951
With special
circumstances.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.386
You have the right
to remain silent.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.388
Anything you say can

36:31.390 --> 36:32.789
And will be used against you
in a court of law.
I did not do this.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.691
Ron!
You have the right
to an attorney.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.459
You can remain silent,
too, sweetie.

36:36.461 --> 36:37.727

Ron: Wait a second.
I did not do this.

<i>I want to do right.</i>

to see the rest?

Would you like me to give her
a message?

37:21.540 --> 37:25.242
No. Thanks.
I'll just leave her a note.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.715

I'm fine.

37:52.136 --> 37:55.705
I was just thinking how --

37:55.707 --> 37:59.976
How in life we sometimes believe
we're looking at something

And then later it turns out
to be something different.

38:03.982 --> 38:07.284
