Dan, now you're
hooking the ball.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.603
You got to take a
little spin off.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.705
I know exactly how
much spin I need Arnie.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.407
The amount of spin
is related the amount

we're last place in the league?

If I find them, I'm going
to give them to Nancy.

We're going to go ice
skating on Tuesday.

Oh, like you're
all chummy with her

07:55.042 --> 07:56.877
after you had some
affair with her husband?

07:56.977 --> 08:00.981
That was not an affair,
that was a one night mistake.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.717
And they weren't even
engaged at the time.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.118

talked it through,

fine between us, OK?

great time and they

(SIGHS) Why does
it matter, Dear?

Because she's my friend
and she's my sister.

of them are gonna

time together, and Dan,

they're not even
thinking to invite me.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.677
You know, if it
wasn't for me, they

08:29.777 --> 08:31.111
wouldn't even know each other.

08:31.211 --> 08:35.082
Well, there is the whole
sordid Arnie connection, dear.

they're getting together

Least you walk around.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.899
My eyes on fire.

09:25.999 --> 09:29.436
My nerves real close to my skin.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.304
DUKE: Shut the door!

09:31.404 --> 09:33.641
DUKE: [singing] Got a
fist full of questions

09:33.741 --> 09:38.011
and he branded on my
cheek, and we would

09:38.111 --> 09:40.781
skate where the ice got thin.

09:44.852 --> 09:45.653
Thank you!

09:45.753 --> 09:46.620
[cheering]

09:46.720 --> 09:47.554
ROSEANNE: Yay!

09:47.655 --> 09:50.290
I'd Like to
introduce the band.

09:50.390 --> 09:53.861
Hank, Pete, that's Jackie,
that's Nancy, that's Roseanne,

09:53.961 --> 09:55.328
and you know Bonnie.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.396
Hey, Guys.

09:56.496 --> 09:57.597
You girls got any requests?

09:57.698 --> 09:59.532
How about do the
dishes once in a while?

09:59.633 --> 10:01.501
I don't know that one.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.971
OK, how about a
nice romantic dinner?

10:04.071 --> 10:05.138
I'm so hungry.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.039
All right.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.440
Band's going out
for a chili dog.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.742
We'll be back in five minutes.

10:08.842 --> 10:09.643
Yay!

10:09.743 --> 10:11.111
He is really good.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.680
Oh, don't tell him that.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.181
He'll want to go back
out on the road again,

10:14.281 --> 10:15.548
and that is no good.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.485
All those beautiful young girls
bouncing up and down saying

10:18.585 --> 10:20.788
get off the stage, grandpa!

10:20.888 --> 10:24.357
I love him way too much
to let that happen.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.393
I thought you were
with DJ tonight.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.061
Well, Mark never showed
up, so Becky's there.

10:28.161 --> 10:28.996
Oh.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.698
You know, I
really like Bonnie.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.199
She's great.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.801
Yeah, she's cool.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.568
Let's invite her to go
ice skating with us Tuesday.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.070
Oh yeah, great.

10:37.170 --> 10:37.971
OK.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.340
J, ready for another beer?

10:40.440 --> 10:41.508
Yeah, sure.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.611
Yo, booze guy, a couple more.

10:44.712 --> 10:45.779
I like beer.

10:45.879 --> 10:49.249
Oh, make it three.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.884
Thanks, J.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.085
Something wrong?

10:52.185 --> 10:53.220
No, nothing's wrong.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.121
OK.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.122

10:55.222 --> 10:58.291
Mm, my, my, my my my, my my,

10:58.391 --> 10:59.626

10:59.727 --> 11:00.894
I'm just looking.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.329
(LAUGHING)

11:02.429 --> 11:04.998
You know I'm totally
devoted to turning Arnie

11:05.098 --> 11:08.068
into something I can live with.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.203
That doesn't mean I can't look.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.438
Back me up on this one, Rosie.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.506
You still look, don't you?

11:13.606 --> 11:14.942
Well, after you
get a few kids,

11:15.042 --> 11:18.378
every time you look at a man,
all you see is more kids.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.981
Well, see that's exactly
what we were talking about.

11:21.081 --> 11:21.882
Yeah, really.

11:21.982 --> 11:22.883
What?

11:22.983 --> 11:27.087
Arnie is begging
her to have a kid.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.958
You were talking
to Jackie about kids?

11:31.058 --> 11:32.192
Is that wrong?

11:32.292 --> 11:36.096
Well, (SCOFFING) Jackie
doesn't even have any kids.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.032
I mean if anybody should be
telling you not to have kids,

11:39.132 --> 11:41.735
I think it should be me.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.971
Well, we weren't really
talking about having kids,

11:44.071 --> 11:45.072
we were talking
about our careers

11:45.172 --> 11:47.074
and how kids would get
in the way right now.

11:47.174 --> 11:47.975
Yeah.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.843
Oh, well then, that's cool.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.544
Talk to Jackie about careers.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.680
I mean, after all
she has had more

11:53.781 --> 11:56.316
than anybody else in the world.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.584
You're mad at me.

11:57.684 --> 11:58.485
I'm not mad.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.587
Yes, you are!

12:00.687 --> 12:01.855
You're mad.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.290
I know the difference between
when you're really mad

12:03.390 --> 12:06.393
and when you're
just being yourself.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.295
I am not mad!

12:08.395 --> 12:09.763
You're not looking at me.

12:09.863 --> 12:13.033
See, when she doesn't make eye
contact, that means she's mad.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.401
I am looking at you.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.569
See.

12:16.669 --> 12:17.670
Ouch.

12:17.771 --> 12:18.939
Well, I just didn't
want to start anything

12:19.039 --> 12:21.108
in front of your little friend.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.142
Oh.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.211
- You're mad at me?
- I'm not mad.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.612
Time out, I get it.

12:25.712 --> 12:29.216
Roseanne, we didn't invite you
because you hate ice skating.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.084
You always complain whenever
I try and get you to go,

12:31.184 --> 12:33.653
and last time I dragged you
down there you hurt your back

12:33.753 --> 12:35.355
and, you were in bed for a day.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.324
Nice try.

12:37.424 --> 12:41.561
Do you want to go ice skating
with me Nancy on Tuesday?

12:41.661 --> 12:44.898
Well, I don't want
any pity invitation.

12:44.998 --> 12:45.866
How about if we're begging?

12:50.370 --> 12:51.872
OK.

12:51.972 --> 12:52.772
Great.

12:52.873 --> 12:53.841
The three of us will go.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.408
It'll be a lot of fun.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.845
OK.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.380
Hey, maybe instead
of ice skating,

13:00.480 --> 13:03.116
you know, we, we could
go see a real nice movie?

13:03.216 --> 13:04.351
We're going skating.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.419
Fine, I guess I just
don't get any say in it.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.593

It's all right, Ray.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.507

have a minute ago.

13:27.607 --> 13:28.775
That's right.
That's right!

13:28.876 --> 13:29.809
Hey, Arnie?

13:29.910 --> 13:31.578
Before you fill up
those size twelves,

13:31.678 --> 13:33.513
maybe you ought to get
a designated driver.

13:33.613 --> 13:34.747
Shut up, skinhead.

13:34.848 --> 13:35.715
Settle down Arnie.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.484
He's got ya rattled.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.086
It's looking bad, Dan.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.453
I'm not gonna worry.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.255
We're down by thirty pins,
and you're not going to worry?

13:42.355 --> 13:43.891
We're going to be drinking
beer out of our shoes.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.259
When I worry, my feet sweat.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.560
Come on, Chucky.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.896
Let's go, Big C!

13:48.996 --> 13:50.730
It's up to you, baby.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.933
Dan, you got to be on the job
site 7 o'clock, Monday morning.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.101
Oh, Arnie, I forgot.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.369
I'm going to have to
bail on that drywall job.

13:56.469 --> 13:59.106
I just got a big snowmobile
deal down at the shop, thanks

13:59.206 --> 14:01.374
anyway.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.309
It's all right, Chucky.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.944
Pick it up on the
next ball, babe.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.478
Dan, I went out
on a limb for you.

14:05.578 --> 14:06.746
Well, you know you can get?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.681

needs the work.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.017
I know who I can get.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.485
Well, I'm sorry Arnie, this
is like a big break for me.

14:12.585 --> 14:13.820
If this deal pans
out, I'll never

14:13.921 --> 14:15.555
have to take another
crappy construction

14:23.830 --> 14:24.631

14:24.731 --> 14:25.665

14:25.765 --> 14:26.900
I don't think it's a crappy job.

14:27.000 --> 14:27.867
Well, you know what I mean.

14:27.968 --> 14:28.936
No, I don't.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.637
I mean, I own my
own bike shop now.

14:30.737 --> 14:31.972
I shouldn't have to
work construction

14:32.072 --> 14:33.240
jobs if I don't want to.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.108
But I have to, so you're
better than me, right?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.676
I didn't say I
was better than you.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.078
Well, I'm just as
smart as you are, Dan.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.079
Fine.

my job as you are.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.600
Yeah, yeah.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.868
Hey, let's go buy Frank a beer
while his shoes are still ripe.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.738
All right, man.
[audience laughter]

17:18.838 --> 17:22.209
[upbeat music playing]

17:26.746 --> 17:28.681
Here we go.

17:28.781 --> 17:32.985
Send this over to that
table with our compliments.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.288
The odor eater is filling
to the top on that one.

17:35.388 --> 17:39.559
Oh, well, then it
needs a twist (LAUGHING).

17:39.659 --> 17:41.828
Yeah, make sure Frank
gets that one (CHUCKLING).

17:45.698 --> 17:46.466
Hi.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.700
Am I too late to see Duke?

17:47.800 --> 17:48.868
Hey!
Oh no.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.002
He's got another set.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.938
Oh, good.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.940
The management of
the Lanford Lanes

17:54.040 --> 17:55.975
would like to congratulate
the new league

17:56.075 --> 17:57.610
champions, the Lucky Strikes.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.646
[cheering weakly]

17:59.746 --> 18:02.315
And the Wrecking
Ballers for crawling out

18:02.415 --> 18:04.951
of last place for the
first time in three years!

18:05.051 --> 18:05.918
[cheering]

18:06.018 --> 18:07.387
There's someone worse than us!

18:07.487 --> 18:09.356
There's someone worse than us!

18:09.456 --> 18:14.261
(LAUGHING) OK, I want to
bring a fresh set of lungs

18:14.361 --> 18:15.628
up here now.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.797
So I want y'all to put your
hands together for my old lady,

18:17.897 --> 18:19.065
Miss Bonnie Watkins.

18:19.166 --> 18:23.970
[bluesy music playing]

18:27.039 --> 18:30.377
[singing] Roll on down.

18:30.477 --> 18:34.381
I'd rather roll
on down with you.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.282
I said--

18:35.382 --> 18:38.718
[singing] Roll on down.

18:38.818 --> 18:44.191
I'd rather roll
on down with you.

18:44.291 --> 18:51.964
Restless dreams of your
life drift elusively again.

18:52.064 --> 18:56.369
[singing] Thought of
our love turning, Darling.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.838
Warmer than a southern wind.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.173
BONNIE: Ah, yeah.

19:00.273 --> 19:04.577
[singing] And if
you really want me.

19:04.677 --> 19:08.548
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

19:08.648 --> 19:12.552
I'm gonna run one
night in Nashville.

19:12.652 --> 19:17.023
Then, I'm gonna roll
on down with you.

19:17.123 --> 19:21.494
I said, roll on down.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.964
I'm gonna roll on down with you.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.933
Yeah, yeah.

19:27.033 --> 19:30.437
Roll on down.

19:30.537 --> 19:40.413
I'm gonna roll on down with you.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.820
[audience applause]

19:50.890 --> 19:51.791
DUKE: Thank you.

19:51.891 --> 19:55.762
[audience applause]

19:55.862 --> 19:59.232
[theme music playing]

20:13.179 --> 20:16.449
Who the hell are you?

20:16.549 --> 20:17.417
Kevin.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.351
Kevin, who?

20:18.451 --> 20:20.987
Kevin Healy, I'm
Mark's brother.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.355
What are you doing here?

20:22.455 --> 20:24.757
Mark and Becky went out, so
they're paying me to watch DJ

20:24.857 --> 20:26.993
until they get back.

20:27.093 --> 20:30.663
Oh, and where is DJ?

20:30.763 --> 20:32.465
I made him go to bed, he
was getting on my nerves.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.003
I'm home.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.038
So, I mean, they just
left you here, all alone.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.172
That was it?

20:40.273 --> 20:42.208
Maybe she thought she'd
get home before you.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.242
Maybe she doesn't care.

20:43.343 --> 20:47.614
Hey for $3, I'm not
covering for her.

20:47.714 --> 20:48.548
I know you, don't I?

20:48.648 --> 20:50.450
You're a sophomore, right?

20:50.550 --> 20:51.584
Yeah.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.786
You hang out with Dave
Malone and those guys?

20:53.886 --> 20:55.988
Sometimes.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.023
My name's Kevin.

20:57.123 --> 20:57.990
I'm Darlene.

20:58.090 --> 20:58.891
I know.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.928
We had detention together once.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.396
Yeah, I thought
I saw you there,

21:03.496 --> 21:05.632
but I didn't think you saw me.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.067
Yeah, I saw you.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.269
I like your hair.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.138
It's just totally
out of control.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.175
Thanks, yours too.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.177
Thanks.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.779
Do you have
detention tomorrow?

21:19.879 --> 21:20.947
Oh, I'm not sure yet.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.152
Well, looks like Darlene's
got her a little friend.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.758
His name's Kevin.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.926
He's Mark's little brother.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.629
Come on, Kev, I'll
give you a ride home.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.966
