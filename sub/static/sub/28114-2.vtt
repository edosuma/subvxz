would appreciate it, either.

year, so I... I'd say your safe.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.867

you never know.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.004
We used to joke
that the only race

10:56.139 --> 11:00.875

was to the grave.

11:02.278 --> 11:04.979
Couldn't even let me have
that one, could you?

11:07.117 --> 11:08.967
Your wife's name was Jo?

11:09.102 --> 11:11.902
Yeah. Yeah, Josephine.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.905
Jo.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.107
And what would Jo say
if she knew

11:16.109 --> 11:18.175
that you were trying
to hock her shit?

11:18.228 --> 11:21.779
(chuckling):
Oh, she'd kick my ass.

11:21.914 --> 11:23.848
She always did.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.067
But at the same time,

11:26.202 --> 11:29.037
she loved to pay things forward.

11:30.140 --> 11:33.807
(stammers) That was her way.

11:33.843 --> 11:35.209
(sighs)

11:35.211 --> 11:37.144
You're lucky, you know.

11:37.180 --> 11:39.146
You're a lucky widower.

11:39.182 --> 11:43.834
Look at this room
and all these awesome memories.

11:43.937 --> 11:47.772
Most people can't string
two good years together.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.774
You got a whole lifetime.

11:49.843 --> 11:53.043
Yeah, well...

11:53.079 --> 11:56.114
It feels a little quick
to be a whole...

11:56.249 --> 11:59.067
anything, but...

11:59.185 --> 12:01.169
I suppose that's right.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.073
(chuckles)

12:06.142 --> 12:08.743
(mimics a monster growling)

12:08.745 --> 12:10.745
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Like that. Like that.

12:10.747 --> 12:12.747
(scoffs)

12:12.749 --> 12:14.832
You know,
I actually used to rep that guy.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.968
SAM: Well, maybe you should've
stuck it out.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.103
This movie's apparently
gonna be "yuge."

12:19.238 --> 12:22.707
Yeah. Not worth it.
I have a quota for assholes.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.708
It's a select few
that are worth the hassle.

-Oh.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.647
Oh, hi. Sam.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.799
Oh, I know.
I grew up watching you.

12:31.934 --> 12:34.001
I've been a fan since
<i> Little Weirdos II.</i>

12:34.070 --> 12:37.071
Whoa. That's the Sam Fox
deep cuts.

12:37.140 --> 12:38.873
-(chuckles)
-(sighs) All right.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.075

12:41.077 --> 12:42.876
Let's roll on this puppy.

12:42.912 --> 12:45.079
Um, Herr Direktor.

12:45.148 --> 12:48.098
-Yeah, what's up?
-Okay, so I was just wondering,

12:48.134 --> 12:49.834
since you're not shooting
my side,

12:49.969 --> 12:52.103
if I can just cough next
to the pile of dead bodies

12:52.238 --> 12:54.105
as opposed to, like,
getting back in there,

12:54.240 --> 12:56.107
because it's kind of hard
to breathe in there.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.108
It gets a little funky.
Like, a little gamey.

12:58.144 --> 13:01.045
(chuckling):
You're so funny.

13:01.180 --> 13:03.181
Yeah, yeah. Sure. Fine.
Let's just do it.

13:03.316 --> 13:07.802
Actually, though,
if we could just check...

13:07.871 --> 13:10.004
Yeah, she might be seen
on "C" cam, so...

13:10.139 --> 13:12.073
Oh, okay. Yup. You heard her.

13:12.075 --> 13:14.942
Sorry, Sam.
Once more into the breach.

13:15.077 --> 13:17.712

Mom, you said you'd be over it
if I got over it.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.675
That means you didn't mean it,

21:18.711 --> 21:19.877

you're a hypocrite.

So... anyway, maybe, uh,
we'll get a coffee

21:45.705 --> 21:48.038
at some point... together.

21:49.609 --> 21:50.858
You and me.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.910
DUKE:
Mom.

21:54.947 --> 21:58.899
Are you aware of the fact
that you owe me an apology

21:59.034 --> 22:00.767
and you're withholding it?

22:00.803 --> 22:02.036
Or did you forget?

22:03.706 --> 22:04.705
What's the matter with you?

22:04.774 --> 22:05.839
And with your son?

22:05.875 --> 22:07.641
What?

22:07.643 --> 22:08.642
Mom, come on.

22:09.712 --> 22:10.778
Do you know

22:10.913 --> 22:12.846
that you drove
onto a school parking lot

22:12.915 --> 22:14.848
on your cell phone
without barely looking up?

22:14.850 --> 22:16.867
Do you know how many kids
you almost hit?

22:16.869 --> 22:18.935
Get away from me.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.004
No. No.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.575
No. No.
I would like to step outside.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.744
-Step outside?
-Yes.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.547
I would like you and I
to step outside

22:30.683 --> 22:33.600
on the playground
so I can beat you up.

22:34.737 --> 22:36.770
Just like your psycho son did
to my daughter.

22:36.839 --> 22:38.539
(sighs)

22:40.843 --> 22:42.642
-Excuse me.
-Hmm.

22:42.712 --> 22:44.644
-Come on. Let's go. Come on.
-Hey. Hey!

22:44.780 --> 22:47.648
-Come on. I would like you
to go outside with me.
-Hey. Hey! Hey!

22:47.783 --> 22:49.533
-Hey!
-(grunts)

22:49.668 --> 22:51.000
-(gasps)
-(crying)

22:51.037 --> 22:52.569
SHAK'S MOM:
Shak?

22:56.642 --> 22:59.943
Okay, we're even. We're even.

22:59.979 --> 23:02.746
Come on, don't cry. Don't cry.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.715
Don't... cry.

23:06.902 --> 23:10.704

with intro sung in Farsi)

23:25.771 --> 23:28.672
