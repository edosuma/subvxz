01:41.151 --> 01:44.052
 We're outside New York's
 Plaza Hotel...

01:44.120 --> 01:47.385
 for the 32nd Annual
 Daytime Television Awards.

01:47.457 --> 01:50.187
 And a glorious,
 glamorous night it is.

01:50.260 --> 01:52.751
 A night of a thousand stars.

02:09.211 --> 02:14.514
From  The Sun Also Sets,  it's
Montana Moorehead and Ariel Maloney!

02:33.103 --> 02:37.563
Such approval from this crowd
must make you feel good.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.167
We have the greatest,
most loyal fans in the world.

02:44.681 --> 02:48.208
With these stars is the show's
producer David Seton Barnes.

02:48.284 --> 02:50.752
David, a big night for you.

02:50.820 --> 02:53.448
Yes, when I originally hatched
the Caribbean theme...

02:54.791 --> 02:56.850
Celeste Talbert!

03:05.268 --> 03:09.398
Celeste! You know her as Maggie
from  The Sun Also Sets.

03:09.472 --> 03:13.841
She's here with Blair Brennan,
who plays her gorgeous husband Bolt.

03:13.910 --> 03:17.937
Celeste, your 12th nomination
as best daytime actress.

03:18.014 --> 03:20.073
It must get to be old hat
for you.

03:20.150 --> 03:23.586
Never, Leeza.
It's always such a genuine thrill.

03:27.323 --> 03:31.316
I know you're anxious to get inside
and share the excitement.

03:31.394 --> 03:33.294
Best of luck to you tonight.

03:33.363 --> 03:35.160
Thanks so much, Leeza.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.860
Now the oil refineries
belong to me.

03:52.994 --> 03:55.462
Only me!

03:55.530 --> 03:57.464
And another thing.

03:59.934 --> 04:02.061
You're all fired.

04:15.349 --> 04:17.976
Now our fifth nominee,
Celeste Talbert...

04:18.052 --> 04:20.612
from  The Sun Also Sets.

04:29.363 --> 04:33.459
I never said I was the best mother.
Give me a little credit, will you?

04:33.534 --> 04:36.628
Credit for being someone
who tried...

04:36.704 --> 04:39.673
to love you the only way
she knew how.

04:41.609 --> 04:43.509
Darling!

04:43.578 --> 04:45.102
Oh, my darling!

04:45.179 --> 04:46.840
Yes!

04:46.914 --> 04:49.542
Yes, yes, yes!

04:49.617 --> 04:51.915
I am guilty!

04:55.189 --> 04:58.556
Guilty of love
in the first degree.

05:04.398 --> 05:05.831
Bolt...

05:09.337 --> 05:12.500
if this operation
isn't a success...

05:12.573 --> 05:14.063
if...

05:15.309 --> 05:17.209
I should die...

05:17.278 --> 05:21.772
 please, please...

05:26.621 --> 05:30.352
 please, don't be sad.

05:32.260 --> 05:34.285
 I want you to be happy.

05:35.463 --> 05:38.660
 You are the great love
 of my life.

05:54.582 --> 05:56.015
And the award...

05:56.083 --> 05:58.074
for best actress...

05:58.152 --> 06:00.143
in a daytime drama...

06:00.221 --> 06:02.416
Tell me you don't love this.

06:02.490 --> 06:04.549
goes to...

06:10.097 --> 06:11.758
Celeste Talbert!

06:18.906 --> 06:21.033
Five minutes, Mr. Loman.

06:21.108 --> 06:25.477
Don't call me Mr. Loman!

06:25.546 --> 06:28.879
My name is Anderson!
Anderson! Anderson!

06:46.434 --> 06:49.062
You're not Uncle Charlie...

06:49.136 --> 06:51.070
'cause Uncle Charlie is not liked.

06:51.138 --> 06:53.072
He's liked,
but not well liked.

07:00.982 --> 07:03.348
There are so many people
to thank.

07:03.417 --> 07:07.717
First of all,
my fabulous supporting cast...

07:07.788 --> 07:10.814
who gives a new meaning
to the word support.

07:10.891 --> 07:12.950
- Bitch.
- Hag.

07:13.027 --> 07:15.621
I hate her so much.

07:15.696 --> 07:20.030
And a great big special thanks
to my best pal, my rock...

07:20.101 --> 07:23.935
the head writer on
 The Sun Also Sets,  Rose Schwartz.

07:24.005 --> 07:26.337
Rosie, stand up, take a bow.

07:29.677 --> 07:32.840
Thank you, everyone,
and have a terrific evening.

07:32.913 --> 07:35.074
See you on the television!

07:38.753 --> 07:40.186
I'm home!

07:41.989 --> 07:43.616
Adam?

07:44.525 --> 07:45.958
Did you watch?

07:46.027 --> 07:47.688
I won!

07:47.762 --> 07:49.195
Yeah, well.

07:50.264 --> 07:53.756
It's just as well you didn't come.
You'd have been bored senseless.

07:53.834 --> 07:57.235
And the reception!
There were so many people.

07:57.304 --> 07:59.568
I tried to get home
as soon as I could.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.837
But you know me, I didn't want
to be rude to anybody.

08:02.910 --> 08:06.141
First you have to say hi
to all the executives.

08:06.213 --> 08:07.646
Adam?

08:10.718 --> 08:13.482
Then you have to say hi
to all the executives' wives.

08:13.554 --> 08:14.987
 Celeste, it's Adam.

08:15.056 --> 08:18.150
 I'm at the airport.
 Good-bye, my darling.

08:18.225 --> 08:21.854
 It was beyond great, but I have
 to go back to Sarah and the kids.

08:21.929 --> 08:24.227
 It's like a chemical thing.

08:24.298 --> 08:26.232
 Hey, putz, I'll be off
 in a second!

08:26.300 --> 08:28.234
 I've left you the plants.

08:28.302 --> 08:32.068
 Please water them, and treat them
 as lovingly as you treated me.

08:58.432 --> 09:00.832
- You do want me, don't you, David?
- You know I do.

09:00.901 --> 09:03.062
- Then get rid of her!
- You think that's easy?

09:03.137 --> 09:05.799
- Give her Alzheimer's.
- Right. Rose is in the way.

09:05.873 --> 09:08.501
- Fire Rose.
- Not with Celeste protecting her.

09:08.576 --> 09:12.171
- God! Celeste, Celeste! Look...
- Grab those revisions.

09:12.246 --> 09:15.909
I am 28 years old.
I need this to happen now!

09:15.983 --> 09:18.543
I am not a new face anymore.

09:18.619 --> 09:23.079
She won her eighth Schmenky.
Edmund's crazy about her.

09:23.157 --> 09:25.284
You dump people
when they're on top...

09:25.359 --> 09:28.351
before they lose their popularity
and drag the show down with them.

09:28.429 --> 09:29.957
Excuse me?

09:30.091 --> 09:32.992
Look, I have a public.
They write me letters.

09:33.060 --> 09:35.358
"More Montana," they write.
Look at these!

09:37.064 --> 09:39.362
"Celeste Talbert
is a menopausal hag.

09:39.433 --> 09:41.594
Let's see more
of Montana Moorehead."

09:41.669 --> 09:43.864
What are you looking at?

09:44.939 --> 09:47.464
Maria Randosie,
Fort Lee, New Jersey.

09:47.542 --> 09:50.943
Fort Lee! That's your audience.
That's the heartland.

09:51.012 --> 09:54.209
I'm aware of my demographics.

09:54.282 --> 09:56.079
Are you?

10:11.599 --> 10:13.794
I want her off the show
worse than you.

10:13.868 --> 10:15.802
You know why?
Then it's my show.

10:15.870 --> 10:18.600
- Our show. A young show.
- A happening show.

10:18.673 --> 10:20.868
Like  Laguna Beach.
Better than  Laguna Beach.

10:20.942 --> 10:24.241
- Hotter. Sandier.
- Wetter. Saltier.

10:24.312 --> 10:26.371
Why aren't we having sex yet?

10:26.447 --> 10:28.381
You know the rules.

10:29.884 --> 10:33.479
Get rid of her,
Mr. Fuzzy is yours.

10:40.561 --> 10:42.324
Gosh, she's cheap.

10:42.396 --> 10:45.297
Ready, three! Go to three!

10:48.402 --> 10:51.098
Ready, two... I mean one!

10:51.172 --> 10:53.333
What is this, what is it?

10:53.407 --> 10:56.638
I was so afraid you were gone.

10:56.711 --> 10:58.144
Gone?

10:59.380 --> 11:03.544
Darling, I could never leave you.

11:03.618 --> 11:05.051
Ever.

11:09.690 --> 11:11.089
That's a cut!

11:12.560 --> 11:15.393
Next time wear a swimsuit
underneath the towel.

11:15.463 --> 11:17.693
It's a little early
in the day for me.

11:17.765 --> 11:19.699
I can't act in a swimsuit.

11:19.767 --> 11:22.930
Celeste, pumpkin!
Were you celebrating last night?

11:23.004 --> 11:25.029
Your eyes look reddish.

11:25.106 --> 11:27.631
We heard about Adam.
It's so sad.

11:27.708 --> 11:29.835
Breaking families apart
is such a tragedy.

11:29.910 --> 11:33.402
Anything you need, just call
any time, day or night.

11:33.481 --> 11:37.508
I don't deserve friends like you.
I'm just too lucky!

11:38.719 --> 11:40.084
David!

11:41.555 --> 11:43.489
Hey, great scene with Bolt.

11:43.557 --> 11:45.889
I realize I'm not a young woman...

11:45.960 --> 11:47.985
however, could you please...

11:48.062 --> 11:51.259
point out to our new costume
designer, whose name I don't...

11:51.332 --> 11:53.266
- Tawny Miller.
- How do you do?

11:53.334 --> 11:55.734
That I don't feel right
in a turban!

11:55.803 --> 11:57.737
What I feel like...

11:57.805 --> 12:01.002
is Gloria "Fucking" Swanson!

12:01.075 --> 12:03.566
What am l, 70, David? Am I 70?

12:03.644 --> 12:08.581
Why don't you put me in a walker?
Buy a walker and put me in it!

12:09.450 --> 12:12.817
You're fired. I'm just kidding.

12:15.489 --> 12:19.653
Attention.
No turbans for Miss Talbert.

12:23.230 --> 12:24.663
Tawny.

12:32.606 --> 12:34.540
Gloria Swanson is dead.

12:34.608 --> 12:37.270
I don't mean dead in a sense,
I mean actually dead!

12:37.344 --> 12:41.303
I'm 42. I don't wanna be dressed
like a dead woman. Understand?

12:41.382 --> 12:45.216
- Then maybe we'll be pals.
- Not good ones!

12:47.154 --> 12:50.021
What is this, PBS?

12:54.228 --> 12:57.857
Very good, very true.
I love what you're doing.

12:57.932 --> 13:02.164
I think we could try it one
more time, and this time...

13:02.236 --> 13:03.828
I don't know.

13:03.904 --> 13:05.963
Maybe try one without your shirt.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.735
Sure.

13:21.689 --> 13:23.714
Will you be having wine
with dinner?

13:23.791 --> 13:26.123
We found our waiter.

13:28.562 --> 13:29.961
Will you be having wine
with dinner?

13:30.030 --> 13:32.828
Will you be having wine
with your dinner?

13:40.407 --> 13:44.241
...from the South of France. No,
I don't think I've seen you before.

13:44.311 --> 13:47.678
That's why
I slept so poorly last night.

13:47.748 --> 13:50.774
For if I tell you, you'll say...

13:50.851 --> 13:52.944
I'm making a big deal
out of nothing.

13:53.721 --> 13:54.983
Delivery.

13:55.055 --> 13:57.489
I'll take it.

13:59.093 --> 14:00.993
You can't go in there!

14:04.598 --> 14:07.590
I'm Lori Craven,
and I'm an actress.

14:07.668 --> 14:09.966
An actress? Really!
How nice for you.

14:10.037 --> 14:13.165
I'm Betsy Faye Sharon,
and I'm a bitch. Now get out.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.937
Miss Sharon,
I've got to get on this show.

14:17.011 --> 14:20.970
I'm not asking for special
treatment, just for a chance.

14:22.016 --> 14:23.005
Yes?

14:23.083 --> 14:26.109
Hi, Betsy.
We need a new homeless now.

14:26.187 --> 14:29.452
But good-looking homeless.
This bunch is disgusting.

14:29.523 --> 14:32.856
You could pick him up
off the street. Come on!

14:32.927 --> 14:34.656
Okay! All right!

14:36.363 --> 14:38.763
- When can you start?
- Open up!

14:38.833 --> 14:42.030
Miss Talbert, for your approval...

14:42.102 --> 14:44.195
we have this for the beach scene.

14:44.271 --> 14:46.205
What do you think of this?

14:46.273 --> 14:50.141
Okay. Or I could line it. Or I
have a black one. That's not good.

14:50.211 --> 14:55.046
Okay, then for tomorrow's fight
with Bolt, you'll wear this.

14:55.115 --> 14:57.447
Okay. All right.

14:57.518 --> 15:01.420
And then for when Blade
accidentally shoots the  contessa.

15:01.488 --> 15:03.718
What do you think of this?
Is this beautiful?

15:03.791 --> 15:07.522
With your hair and eyes,
this will look beautiful.

15:07.595 --> 15:10.155
Okay. We can accessorize
in the morning.

15:10.231 --> 15:12.222
I had this idea.

15:12.299 --> 15:14.859
How do you feel about
a Tammy Faye Baker...

15:14.935 --> 15:17.665
kind of a thing, you know?

15:17.738 --> 15:21.367
Not like the boots or crucifix
or anything...

15:21.442 --> 15:23.672
but some eyelashes
to bring your eyes out.

15:23.744 --> 15:24.870
What?

15:26.480 --> 15:27.879
Nothing.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.742
All right...

15:39.750 --> 15:43.083
Rose, don't hover.
Come in or get out.

15:43.988 --> 15:45.922
What are you doing?

15:47.892 --> 15:52.761
Have you gone insane? Do you know
the word is you're crazed today?

15:55.132 --> 15:57.430
- What's in your mouth?
- A cigarette.

15:57.501 --> 16:00.129
I know. Why is it in your mouth?
You don't smoke.

16:00.204 --> 16:01.831
I do now!

16:01.906 --> 16:04.739
Okay. Are you okay? You're fine?

16:04.808 --> 16:06.742
- Fine!
- Fine.

16:12.283 --> 16:14.774
Adam went home to his wife.

16:14.852 --> 16:16.911
Really? Oh!

16:19.456 --> 16:23.984
When I got home last night,
there was a message on the machine.

16:24.061 --> 16:26.655
On the machine, Rose!

16:26.730 --> 16:28.220
He's a dog.

16:28.299 --> 16:32.099
He went home to Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh!

16:32.169 --> 16:35.366
Does that tell you anything
about my appeal?

16:35.439 --> 16:38.340
Why were you going with somebody
from Pittsburgh?

16:38.409 --> 16:41.139
It was inevitable because I'm...

16:41.211 --> 16:44.612
- A home wrecker.
- A home wrecker and I'm old.

16:44.682 --> 16:46.650
They put me in a turban, Rose.

16:46.717 --> 16:48.378
They put me in a turban.

16:48.452 --> 16:50.886
- It's a plot.
- It is a plot. A plot!

16:50.955 --> 16:54.413
David and Montana are plotting
against me every day.

16:54.491 --> 16:56.857
- Those bastards.
- I can't do this.

16:56.927 --> 16:58.258
You are right.

16:58.329 --> 17:00.763
Why don't you please tell me
to get off the show?

17:04.734 --> 17:06.669
You're not going to eat that.

17:07.838 --> 17:11.898
- Then why did you order it?
- I don't know.

17:11.976 --> 17:14.444
- Then cover it up.
- I like them.

17:14.511 --> 17:16.411
Cover the crawdad butts.

17:16.480 --> 17:19.779
 Stephen, please call wardrobe.

17:19.849 --> 17:23.479
I was up half the night thinking
of all these men, these losers.

17:23.554 --> 17:26.318
All the way back
to Jeffrey Anderson.

17:26.390 --> 17:29.917
You went with him when you were
a kid. You gotta get over this.

17:29.994 --> 17:33.225
I'm gonna start eating with Montana.
You driving me crazy.

17:33.297 --> 17:35.322
I have to get off this show
while I'm still alive.

17:35.399 --> 17:39.699
Fine. I could write you out for six
months. You could take a sabbatical.

17:39.770 --> 17:41.704
Six months you'll be gone.

17:41.772 --> 17:46.937
We'll say Maggie went to visit
the Dalai Lama. Spiritual thing.

17:47.011 --> 17:49.036
I thought the Dalai Lama
moved to L.A.

17:49.113 --> 17:52.207
Some other Lama then. It doesn't
matter. Fernando Lama. Come on!

17:52.282 --> 17:55.513
No! What would I do
on a sabbatical?

17:55.586 --> 17:58.077
This is all I know, this show.

17:59.156 --> 18:01.556
It's so pathetic.

18:03.961 --> 18:05.360
It's time...

18:05.429 --> 18:08.830
to take a big trip across
the George Washington Bridge.

18:08.899 --> 18:10.764
No.

18:10.834 --> 18:12.961
It's a good idea.

18:13.037 --> 18:14.629
It's a crutch.

18:14.705 --> 18:16.866
It's a crutch!

18:16.940 --> 18:19.340
We'll do it
this one last time, okay?

18:22.212 --> 18:24.146
All right, this once.

18:34.525 --> 18:36.618
- I'm ready. Are you?
- Yes.

18:49.339 --> 18:52.467
Oh! Oh, look! Look, look!

18:52.543 --> 18:56.912
Aren't you on that TV show?
Oh, look!

18:56.980 --> 19:00.006
- You look so small.
- Is that her?

19:00.084 --> 19:02.075
You're from  The Sun Also Sets.

19:02.152 --> 19:03.676
I want an autograph.

19:03.754 --> 19:07.884
You look so pretty.
Wait a minute!

19:07.958 --> 19:09.892
I see you on TV every day.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.224
Oh, what's her name?

19:12.296 --> 19:17.199
Oh, tell me your name.
Shut up. What's your name?

19:17.267 --> 19:19.360
Celeste! Oh, that's you!

19:19.436 --> 19:23.031
Give me that. Sign this for me.
You have to wait for me.

19:23.107 --> 19:24.938
Yes, to whom?

19:25.008 --> 19:28.068
Latice. L-A-T-l-C-E.
I can't believe it!

19:28.145 --> 19:30.705
- Your hair looks nice.
- You can leave now.

19:30.781 --> 19:33.614
I can't believe it.
Get in there.

20:11.188 --> 20:12.450
 Absolutely.

20:12.523 --> 20:14.889
Renting cars to people?
That's acting.

20:14.958 --> 20:18.325
That's how I feel.
That I'm performing.

20:18.395 --> 20:20.329
The motivation's built in.

20:20.397 --> 20:23.833
You could tell I had talent
just by watching me lease a car?

20:23.901 --> 20:26.096
It's that obvious.

20:26.170 --> 20:28.968
My God, you have beautiful hands.

20:29.039 --> 20:31.200
Hands say so much about a person.

20:33.010 --> 20:35.945
As an actor,
I'm very conscious of my hands.

20:36.013 --> 20:39.449
When I play Willy, I feel
as if I have salesmen's hands.

20:39.516 --> 20:42.713
You are something up there.

20:42.786 --> 20:45.050
I couldn't keep my eyes
off of you.

20:45.122 --> 20:50.116
I noticed you too.
The girl in the brown uniform.

20:55.999 --> 20:58.297
I think we're avoiding intimacy.
My therapist says...

20:58.368 --> 21:01.826
I've racked my brains for ideas
to drive that bitch off the show!

21:01.905 --> 21:04.237
I got it!
We give her Bell's palsy.

21:04.308 --> 21:06.469
Right! On the... On the...

21:06.543 --> 21:08.511
What kind of moron are you?

21:08.579 --> 21:10.740
It's a serious disfiguring disease.

21:10.814 --> 21:13.510
David, do you remember what happened
on  Bold and the Brash...

21:13.584 --> 21:15.575
when they made Tiffany
become incontinent?

21:15.652 --> 21:18.780
Do you? Thousands
of sympathy letters.

21:18.856 --> 21:21.381
She became the bed wetters'
celebrity spokesperson.

21:21.458 --> 21:23.824
She hosted her own telethon.

21:23.894 --> 21:25.919
Is that what we want, David?

21:25.996 --> 21:28.931
We have got to get off the dime
sexually because I'm losing it.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.933
I would kill to have you
on all fours.

21:31.001 --> 21:33.902
Would you?
Then you know what you have to do.

21:33.971 --> 21:36.565
- Make Maggie a murderess.
- Oh, a death!

21:36.640 --> 21:38.608
Yes. It will turn the country
against her.

21:38.675 --> 21:40.609
- It can't be one of the regulars.
- Not even Bolt?

21:40.677 --> 21:44.078
No, Bolt's gold, especially with
the impotency thing coming up.

21:44.147 --> 21:47.310
- One of the extras?
- One of the extras.

21:47.384 --> 21:49.443
One of the homeless, David.

21:49.519 --> 21:52.386
- That's cruel.
- It's very cruel.

21:52.456 --> 21:55.448
- You do want me, don't you, David?
- In the weirdest way.

21:55.525 --> 21:57.117
You're this close.

22:00.864 --> 22:04.143
I've got to seriously review
this relationship.

22:04.277 --> 22:07.178
Ariel should
be raped by Father Cory.

22:11.584 --> 22:16.453
The  contessa  should be kidnapped
by some colored guys.

22:16.522 --> 22:18.114
Colored guys?

22:18.191 --> 22:20.751
Can you bring us up to date
before Edmund gets here?

22:20.827 --> 22:22.727
Feel free to follow along.

22:22.795 --> 22:25.593
Claude is determined to attend
Steve's funeral...

22:25.665 --> 22:29.260
in a motorized wheelchair which
he operates by blowing into a tube.

22:29.335 --> 22:30.529
Meanwhile...

22:30.603 --> 22:33.436
That's cute, but when are we
gonna put someone in a coma?

22:33.506 --> 22:37.237
Actors don't like to play coma.
They feel it limits their range.

22:37.310 --> 22:38.777
Very good, Rose.

22:39.846 --> 22:41.473
Morning, Mr. Edwards.

22:53.359 --> 22:56.123
We were going over
some story lines and...

22:56.195 --> 22:59.562
I would like to voice
my strong concern...

22:59.632 --> 23:02.931
about this show's spiraling
decline in ratings.

23:04.737 --> 23:07.137
David, ever since you took us
to the Caribbean...

23:07.206 --> 23:10.505
it's been Jamaica homeless people
sucking soup...

23:10.576 --> 23:15.104
and the big wave outside
that cost $100,000.

23:15.181 --> 23:18.412
That's depressing and expensive.
Two words I hate.

23:18.484 --> 23:24.286
You know the words I like?
I like "peppy" and "cheap."

23:24.357 --> 23:27.918
I agree a thousand percent.
Rose and I were just exploring...

23:27.994 --> 23:30.622
- No, we weren't.
- Yes, we were.

23:30.696 --> 23:33.290
I also wanted to keep to
the socially-relevant story lines...

23:33.366 --> 23:37.530
such as the homeless or oil spills
or breast implants.

23:48.347 --> 23:52.477
The point I'm trying to make
is that quiz shows are beating us.

23:52.552 --> 23:56.147
There's a lady cooking sausages
almost tied us last week.

23:56.222 --> 23:59.658
A guy at my tennis club said it
should be called  The Sun Also Sucks.

23:59.725 --> 24:02.193
I don't like this gentleman.

24:02.261 --> 24:07.824
I have been the head of daytime
programming for a long, long time.

24:09.502 --> 24:11.868
Maybe too long.

24:11.938 --> 24:14.532
Don't be silly.
You are daytime programming.

24:14.607 --> 24:17.405
But I do know one thing.

24:17.476 --> 24:21.776
When the ratings go down,
you have to do something drastic.

24:21.848 --> 24:24.715
The "D" word, David.
Drastic.

24:26.018 --> 24:28.111
Might I suggest...

24:29.522 --> 24:30.955
a murder.

24:31.891 --> 24:33.017
A murder?

24:33.092 --> 24:36.186
An accidental murder
of one of the homeless.

24:36.262 --> 24:39.356
Who would murder a homeless person?

24:39.432 --> 24:40.421
Celeste?

24:40.499 --> 24:42.694
Ultimately it's great for her.

24:42.768 --> 24:47.171
She has a trial, gets let off.
It's up. We want something up.

24:47.240 --> 24:51.040
You're telling me you want her
to murder some homeless person.

24:51.110 --> 24:54.375
Relax. It's topical,
and it has resonance.

24:54.447 --> 24:56.608
Forget it. I'm not doing it.

24:59.252 --> 25:02.278
Rose, how much
are your condo payments?

25:02.355 --> 25:07.850
I have worked with her for 15 years
and written every word she uttered.

25:07.927 --> 25:11.385
And I ain't writing nothing
"garbagy" like that. Understand me?

25:12.565 --> 25:14.965
What did Rose say?
What did she say?

25:15.034 --> 25:18.902
She loves it, but she's really tired
so we'll flesh it out...

25:18.971 --> 25:20.996
and she'll polish it
in the morning.

25:21.073 --> 25:25.203
David, I don't think
we have established Maggie...

25:25.278 --> 25:27.974
in the soup kitchen milieu.

25:29.115 --> 25:32.380
Burton, she's in the milieu now.
Give her a ladle. Case closed.

25:32.451 --> 25:36.615
I shouldn't have said that. I'm
sorry. I was wrong, you were right.

25:37.490 --> 25:38.821
Who dies?

25:42.495 --> 25:47.057
- Look at the hooters.
- We should kill that blonde one.

25:47.133 --> 25:50.261
You can't kill a blonde woman.
You'll drive half the men...

25:50.336 --> 25:51.428
That's her.

25:53.105 --> 25:55.039
- She dies.
- Gimme a break.

25:55.107 --> 25:58.406
She's got an angel's face. Celeste
should kill her with that face?

25:58.477 --> 26:01.742
You know why?
Because it's powerful.

26:01.814 --> 26:04.783
The young girl. She's beautiful,
but she's deranged.

26:04.850 --> 26:07.250
She's a powder keg. She's got
a chemical imbalance. What is it?

26:07.320 --> 26:10.312
- Bipolar.
- The Bill Styron thing.

26:10.389 --> 26:13.358
She's in the soup kitchen. Celeste
is there. "You want some soup?"

26:13.426 --> 26:16.657
But it clicks something off.
She snaps. She pulls a knife out.

26:16.729 --> 26:18.560
Excuse me, David.

26:18.631 --> 26:20.690
- Where does she get this knife?
- On her. Burton.

26:22.868 --> 26:24.597
It can work.

26:28.007 --> 26:32.137
She came in. I don't know who
she is. Her name's Mavin, Slavin...

26:32.211 --> 26:34.145
- There's no agent.
- Find her!

26:34.213 --> 26:37.705
- What if she can't act?
- That never stopped us before.

26:39.051 --> 26:40.484
What?

26:44.090 --> 26:47.685
We make her mute. She doesn't speak,
we don't have to pay her as much.

26:47.760 --> 26:51.457
A homeless deaf-mute.
What could be more pathetic?

26:52.598 --> 26:54.532
God, I'm good.

27:09.949 --> 27:11.473
Lori Craven?

27:13.152 --> 27:16.349
- This is your lucky...
- Day.

27:20.259 --> 27:23.717
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're starving.

27:23.796 --> 27:27.562
You haven't eaten in years, so
you smell the soup and get in line.

27:27.633 --> 27:31.194
Your knees are shaking.
Shake your knees.

27:31.270 --> 27:33.170
A little less.

27:33.239 --> 27:34.729
Perfect! Beautiful!

27:34.807 --> 27:40.074
When the soup lady arrives,
something inside of you snaps.

27:40.146 --> 27:42.171
- A crack-up.
- Exactly, exactly.

27:42.248 --> 27:44.182
It's all gotten to you...

27:44.250 --> 27:47.947
the poverty, deprivation,
peeing in the streets.

27:48.020 --> 27:50.921
So you reach into your bag...

27:50.990 --> 27:53.618
and you grab the knife!

27:53.692 --> 27:57.890
- It's really big!
- It looks smaller on the screen.

27:57.963 --> 28:01.956
You take the knife,
and you lunge at the soup lady.

28:03.035 --> 28:07.768
As you are mute, you cannot speak,
so you grunt a little.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.865
Okay? Try it.

28:10.843 --> 28:12.276
Good.

28:12.344 --> 28:14.369
Who do I lunge for?

28:14.447 --> 28:16.381
You lunge for Maggie.

28:17.249 --> 28:20.946
Miss Celeste Talbert.
Going big time, kid.

28:21.020 --> 28:24.456
Okay, boys and girls,
we're going to tape this rehearsal.

28:24.523 --> 28:28.289
And remember, poverty, depression...

28:28.360 --> 28:30.089
society's ills.

28:30.162 --> 28:35.566
We are making a statement.
Don't underline it, just make it.

28:35.634 --> 28:38.364
- Burton?
- I'm sorry.

28:38.437 --> 28:43.033
- Rose, can I talk to you outside?
- About what?

28:43.109 --> 28:46.442
This Uncle Hugo thing and the will.
I find it confusing.

28:46.512 --> 28:47.945
You're confused?

28:48.013 --> 28:51.949
The man was your uncle. He died.
He didn't leave you shit.

28:52.017 --> 28:54.577
You're upset. Period.

28:54.653 --> 28:58.453
What about their history together?
Was there always animosity?

28:58.524 --> 29:01.239
Yes! Ever since you ran over
the man's schnauzer.

29:01.373 --> 29:04.740
I have my script outside.

29:04.810 --> 29:07.438
I just wanna make some notes.
Okay? Please.

29:08.647 --> 29:12.777
I would think you were acting,
but you've never been this good.

29:19.224 --> 29:21.283
- What?
- Here it comes.

29:21.359 --> 29:24.260
David! David!

29:25.664 --> 29:27.564
I'm so sorry.

29:27.632 --> 29:31.625
I murder some homeless girl?
Are you nuts?

29:31.703 --> 29:33.136
Rose!

29:35.373 --> 29:38.467
She was just here. Sweetie, it was
an accident. She falls on the knife.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.670
- Then what?
- There's a great trial.

29:40.745 --> 29:42.474
David, another trial?

29:42.547 --> 29:45.516
There hasn't been a trial since '87.
They wanted a death upstairs.

29:45.584 --> 29:49.179
- I'm not doing it!
- Well, okay.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.722
Oh, my God.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.726
It's nothing, just my...

29:55.794 --> 29:57.125
Oh, my God!

29:58.163 --> 30:00.256
Rub right here. Please, please!

30:00.332 --> 30:01.765
I've got it!

30:01.833 --> 30:03.801
Will you call Edmund and talk?

30:03.869 --> 30:06.929
- They're hot for a killing.
- They said that?

30:07.005 --> 30:09.166
You have no idea the flak
I'm getting from management.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.641
I'm trying to shield you from it
because I love you and it's my job.

30:11.710 --> 30:14.804
But this time
he laid down the law.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.781
- But we're not gonna do it.
- We're not?

30:17.849 --> 30:19.942
I said "Celeste won't be
a happy camper.

30:20.018 --> 30:23.078
You can't make me do this to her!
I love her!"

30:23.154 --> 30:27.181
- Maybe we should do it.
- No. It hurts me to hurt you.

30:27.259 --> 30:31.320
- I won't do it!
- This is not your decision to make.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.455
This comes from upstairs.

30:33.531 --> 30:38.491
We've gotta get up right now,
get over there and do it!

30:41.740 --> 30:43.173
Let's do it!

30:43.241 --> 30:45.072
Places, everybody.

30:45.143 --> 30:47.941
Tawny! Where the hell
is that woman?

30:51.983 --> 30:53.678
Places, everyone.

30:53.752 --> 30:56.721
And three...

30:56.788 --> 30:58.619
two...

30:58.690 --> 31:00.419
one.

31:06.932 --> 31:10.527
- A little soup, it's so warming.
- You're so kind, miss.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.661
Call me Maggie.

31:14.739 --> 31:18.436
There we are. Please go in,
and get out of the sun.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.444
It's coming.

31:20.512 --> 31:22.139
Here's yours.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.975
And yours, my dear.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.848
Some for you.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.454
The one after this.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.395
Lori?

31:48.506 --> 31:50.633
Aunt Celeste.

31:56.982 --> 31:58.574
 That's a cut.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.815
- Did the mute speak?
- Lori, you're a mute. Don't speak.

32:02.887 --> 32:04.718
I'm sorry.

32:09.060 --> 32:13.861
Hi, Edward. I am so livid.
I think Rose Schwartz should be...

32:16.468 --> 32:18.834
We thought you'd feel that way.
We love it too.

32:20.372 --> 32:23.307
It's so good to see you!

32:24.676 --> 32:27.941
Look at you!
What are you doing here?

32:29.114 --> 32:31.173
Well, I left college.

32:31.249 --> 32:33.274
You left college.

32:33.351 --> 32:35.581
You mean you left?
You don't mean you left college?

32:35.653 --> 32:39.885
You left it? No! No, that's
not possible. No. Come on.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.519
I'm so grateful for everything
you've done.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.564
Tuition. All the checks.
How could I live without you?

32:46.631 --> 32:48.565
Where are you staying?

32:49.834 --> 32:52.166
- At the Hotel Marmaduke.
- There's no such place.

32:52.237 --> 32:53.602
Yes, there is.

32:53.671 --> 32:57.198
We'll go there, get your stuff
and then go to the airport.

32:57.275 --> 33:00.142
- Where are we going?
- You're going home.

33:00.211 --> 33:03.009
I can't go home.
I just got a job.

33:03.081 --> 33:04.605
Taxi!

33:04.682 --> 33:06.274
I want to act!

33:08.286 --> 33:11.119
Don't say, "I want to act." Ever.
Please!

33:11.189 --> 33:13.817
- May I have autograph?
- Yes! To whom?

33:13.892 --> 33:16.156
I'm sorry, sir. Thanks anyway.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.220
I can't shake it.
It's all I ever think about.

33:20.298 --> 33:23.893
- Does Grandma know you're here?
- Yes. I told her yesterday.

33:23.968 --> 33:26.198
You're too young
to be in the city by yourself.

33:26.271 --> 33:28.205
You were 16
when you came to New York.

33:28.273 --> 33:30.741
You see me as a role model?
You want to end up like me?

33:30.809 --> 33:32.572
I need a cab!

33:32.644 --> 33:35.010
I can't have it.
I just can't have it!

33:35.080 --> 33:38.914
Why does it have to be about you?
What about me?

33:38.983 --> 33:40.348
Please!

33:40.418 --> 33:46.186
I didn't see you in the senior play,
missing three days' work? Please!

33:46.257 --> 33:48.851
- I'm having a life here.
- But I love you.

33:48.927 --> 33:50.155
I love you.

33:50.228 --> 33:54.562
Who sent chocolates when you were
sick and phoned you day and night?

33:54.632 --> 33:57.294
- I'm staying, Celeste.
- You're going.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.461
Read my lips.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.635
Don't say, "Read my lips."
Really.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.770
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious.

34:08.847 --> 34:11.371
All right, if you're staying,
you're staying with me.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.016
 It didn't work!

34:13.150 --> 34:17.679
I'm not gonna let this work to
her advantage. We need to be smart!

34:17.755 --> 34:20.985
You know, you and I never exchanged
our views about religion...

34:21.059 --> 34:23.118
never shared
our childhood memories...

34:23.194 --> 34:25.424
You wanna know about my childhood?

34:25.496 --> 34:27.929
I had no friends.
I wore too much makeup.

34:27.998 --> 34:31.196
All the kids thought I was evil!
Now look at me. Nurse Nan.

34:31.268 --> 34:33.760
David, I cannot be
the villain forever.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.598
I'm sweet. I'm tender.
I'm a victim!

34:37.675 --> 34:40.041
Can you just... with the hair.

34:40.110 --> 34:42.045
I need a cigarette.

34:46.484 --> 34:51.649
- I want Celeste to burn.
- So do I.

34:51.723 --> 34:55.056
Especially if it will help
bring us closer. I'm an optimist.

34:55.126 --> 34:57.390
Do you want to hear about
my childhood?

34:58.896 --> 35:00.659
The actor that wrote you...

35:00.732 --> 35:03.758
the one Celeste had the affair with,
the one she hated.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.827
Jeffrey Anderson.
She had him thrown off the show.

35:06.904 --> 35:08.963
Bring him back!

35:09.040 --> 35:11.668
- Do you mind?
- Okay.Just checking.

35:11.743 --> 35:15.076
He's probably selling something.
Who knows where the hell he is?

35:15.146 --> 35:16.909
He's in Florida.

35:16.981 --> 35:18.949
Do you mind?

35:21.586 --> 35:24.419
What is it about you?
I can't put my finger on it.

35:24.489 --> 35:28.425
You're not my type. I'm used
to dating petite, waifish girls.

35:28.493 --> 35:30.427
But I'm so drawn to you!

35:30.495 --> 35:33.589
It's not just chemical.
I believe it's spiritual.

35:33.665 --> 35:38.261
I believe it too. Now, if you want
to get to know the real me...

35:39.270 --> 35:40.862
Find Jeffrey Anderson.

35:40.938 --> 35:43.304
Hmm. Can I touch your breasts?

35:43.374 --> 35:44.807
Find him!

35:52.784 --> 35:54.445
 Where'd you go?

35:55.687 --> 35:58.349
I got on the road and went north
to Providence.

35:58.423 --> 36:00.823
- Met the mayor.
- The mayor of Providence?

36:00.892 --> 36:02.689
- What did he say?
- The mayor.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.751
- The mayor of Providence.
- Who?

36:04.829 --> 36:07.730
The mayor of Providence, Pop?

36:07.799 --> 36:10.893
Yeah! The mayor of Providence.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.963
Rhode Island!

36:14.038 --> 36:15.528
Oh, waiter!

36:15.606 --> 36:17.198
Waiter!

36:17.275 --> 36:19.243
He was sitting
in the hotel lobby.

36:19.310 --> 36:22.370
- Waiter? Waiter?
- What did he say?

36:24.015 --> 36:28.918
"Good morning." I said,
"You got a fine city here, Mayor."

36:28.986 --> 36:33.320
- Then...
- You're doing so well up there.

36:33.391 --> 36:36.087
Then I had a cup of coffee...

36:38.996 --> 36:42.022
Then I went to Boston.

36:42.100 --> 36:46.594
Fine city, Boston. Then a couple
of other towns in Mass.

36:46.671 --> 36:50.698
Portland, Bangor and straight home!

36:50.775 --> 36:52.333
What is he yelling?

37:01.652 --> 37:04.018
You have a visitor, Mr. Loman.

37:04.088 --> 37:06.784
Stop calling me Mr. Loman!

37:06.858 --> 37:09.918
Hi, Jeffrey. David Barnes.
Producer,  Sun Also Sets.

37:11.462 --> 37:14.522
- I saw the show.
- Ah, no, no!

37:14.599 --> 37:15.998
What?

37:16.067 --> 37:18.262
No! Not tonight!

37:18.336 --> 37:20.804
Jesus, God, they were awful!

37:20.872 --> 37:24.535
I've seen dinner theater before.
I know real talent when I see it.

37:24.609 --> 37:27.134
- What?
- I think you're one of a kind.

37:27.211 --> 37:29.577
Can I buy you a drink?
You look a little parched.

37:29.647 --> 37:32.081
Yeah, yeah, thanks. Sure. The bar...

37:32.150 --> 37:33.845
Change first.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.588
I'll be right there.

37:43.561 --> 37:46.189
What exactly would I be doing
on the show?

37:46.264 --> 37:49.722
We thought you'd return
as the original character.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.735
Rod Randall?

37:51.803 --> 37:57.036
Here it is. Rod Randall returns
as a world-famous doctor.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.133
He's been studying in Europe.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.805
I like it. Life and death issues.
He's been abroad.

38:03.881 --> 38:06.509
- Vienna.
- Perfect.

38:06.584 --> 38:10.247
It's kind of a continental,
world weary kind of thing.

38:10.321 --> 38:12.289
That's it.

38:12.356 --> 38:14.187
I like it.

38:14.258 --> 38:16.624
He's seen things in Europe.

38:16.694 --> 38:19.288
European things.
Sophisticated things.

38:19.363 --> 38:22.696
- Things of the world.
- Maybe an accent.

38:22.767 --> 38:24.997
I'd stay away from accents.

38:25.069 --> 38:30.530
The thing is, though, I got
this idea for a one-man  Hamlet.

38:30.608 --> 38:32.542
I need time to develop that.

38:32.610 --> 38:36.637
Come to New York. We'll set you up
with a producer, do it off-Broadway.

38:36.714 --> 38:40.309
My theory is that
all the characters are Hamlet.

38:40.384 --> 38:42.944
It's all happening
in Hamlet's head.

38:43.020 --> 38:45.853
So you only need one actor.
Am I crazy?

38:45.923 --> 38:48.824
No. That actually clears up
a lot of stuff for me.

38:48.893 --> 38:53.091
Back to  The Sun Also Sets,
which is the topic at hand.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.995
Shortly after returning...

38:55.733 --> 39:00.136
Dr. Rod Randall starts
a torrid love affair...

39:00.204 --> 39:02.069
with Celeste Talbert.

39:11.582 --> 39:13.140
Celeste Talbert?

39:15.119 --> 39:17.713
She's the one who had me axed
off the show 20 years ago.

39:18.890 --> 39:19.982
I mean...

39:20.057 --> 39:24.118
Celeste and l,
we were just kids.

39:24.195 --> 39:27.460
But... Excuse me.
Still, we had something.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.328
There was a...

39:29.400 --> 39:31.368
fire, passion.

39:31.435 --> 39:35.337
No! She wanted to be
a big star!

39:35.406 --> 39:38.068
Nothing else mattered.
Love. Nothing!

39:40.678 --> 39:42.441
Look at this.

39:43.514 --> 39:47.041
Talk about fame's fleeting chariot.

39:50.988 --> 39:52.012
Gee whiz.

39:54.325 --> 39:55.349
Jesus.

39:56.527 --> 39:59.963
Boy, did that get screwed up!

40:00.031 --> 40:03.432
But now, here you are
out of the blue offering me...

40:03.501 --> 40:05.298
another chance.

40:05.369 --> 40:07.303
A chance to be something.

40:07.371 --> 40:10.272
Be somebody.

40:10.341 --> 40:12.673
Get reacquainted with Celeste.

40:15.346 --> 40:18.315
And wreck her life
the way she wrecked mine!

40:49.981 --> 40:51.573
New boy in town?

40:51.649 --> 40:54.846
Just stepped off the choo-choo.

40:54.919 --> 40:56.853
You have beautiful eyes.

40:56.921 --> 40:59.321
They're nothing compared
to my tits.

41:00.758 --> 41:03.056
Come up and see me sometime.

41:10.308 --> 41:11.741
Good morning.

41:14.245 --> 41:16.179
- Tawny.
- Hello, Miss Talbert.

41:16.247 --> 41:19.944
- Have you met my niece Lori?
- Yes, several times.

41:20.017 --> 41:22.781
- She's my new roommate.
- Good for you.

41:22.854 --> 41:25.186
Why do you have to make
such a production about it?

41:25.256 --> 41:29.317
So I'm happy for one brief,
flickering moment. Sue me.

41:29.393 --> 41:31.486
- Where are you going?
- Extras' room.

41:31.562 --> 41:33.996
I have to get
into my homeless rags.

41:41.339 --> 41:45.605
Rod Randall is back from the dead?
How dumb is this?

41:45.676 --> 41:48.770
The man was killed in 1973
in an auto accident.

41:48.846 --> 41:52.475
So he wasn't killed. He was maimed.
We give him reconstructive surgery.

41:52.550 --> 41:56.816
What are you talking about? The guy
was decapitated. I looked it up.

41:56.888 --> 41:59.755
He was on his way to the Yukon
in a pink convertible...

41:59.824 --> 42:02.190
to see his brother who was
an ex-con named Francis...

42:02.260 --> 42:05.593
when a tractor-trailer came along
and decapitated him.

42:05.663 --> 42:08.325
You know what that means.
He doesn't have a head!

42:08.399 --> 42:10.663
How am I supposed to write for a guy
that doesn't have a head?

42:10.735 --> 42:12.999
He's got no lips, no vocal cords.
What do you want me to do?

42:13.070 --> 42:17.302
They froze the head, put it back on
in a two-day operation.

42:17.375 --> 42:19.002
Use your imagination.

42:19.076 --> 42:21.010
He doesn't have a head!

42:21.078 --> 42:23.740
Never mind, never mind.
I will work this out myself.

42:23.814 --> 42:28.513
I want you to help me understand
making Celeste Montana's mother.

42:28.586 --> 42:31.487
Did Celeste have her when
she was five, six, seven? When?

42:31.556 --> 42:34.457
Guess what. You'll work it out.
You're a writer.

42:34.525 --> 42:37.619
What is this horseshit?
I'm Montana's mother?

42:37.695 --> 42:39.959
Never! And you!

42:40.031 --> 42:42.864
Oh, no, no, no.

42:42.934 --> 42:46.734
- I can't believe you'd write this.
- I didn't. He did it!

42:46.804 --> 42:49.864
- And you! And you!
- I was under orders.

42:49.941 --> 42:51.568
So was Hitler!

42:51.642 --> 42:54.702
I don't mean Hitler.
I mean the other guy.

42:54.779 --> 42:56.337
- Hess.
- Eichmann.

42:57.481 --> 43:00.678
Eichmann! Thank you.
Eichmann. That's you.

43:00.751 --> 43:04.915
Rod Randall comes back from Vienna?
I fall in love with him?

43:04.989 --> 43:08.447
And Montana turns out
to be my daughter?

43:08.526 --> 43:11.495
How in the name of God
is that possible?

43:11.562 --> 43:16.158
We haven't figured that out, but the
dark secret's been torturing you.

43:16.234 --> 43:20.898
David, you can't turn me into a
grandmother. I still have my looks.

43:20.972 --> 43:23.873
I think the romance with Rod
balances that.

43:23.941 --> 43:26.569
- Who plays him?
- He's an actor's actor.

43:26.644 --> 43:28.475
Oh, no, no.

43:28.546 --> 43:30.946
You're not gonna stick me
with that John Farbstein again...

43:31.015 --> 43:33.347
with the yellow teeth
and the long nose hair.

43:33.417 --> 43:36.648
I'm not getting in bed with him.
Some people I don't get in bed with.

43:37.822 --> 43:40.222
Sorry. I thought
this was my dressing room.

43:44.662 --> 43:45.754
Hello, Celeste.

43:54.138 --> 43:56.197
Maybe I should've sent a memo.

44:18.162 --> 44:21.063
No, Rod, this is not the time.

44:21.132 --> 44:24.659
We must think of the poor
deaf girl upstairs.

44:27.238 --> 44:28.762
Good evening.

44:33.077 --> 44:37.036
I'm Dr. Monica Demonico, the
neurosurgeon assigned to this case.

44:37.114 --> 44:39.446
You must be Dr. Rod Randall.

44:39.517 --> 44:42.645
So good of you to come
on such short notice.

44:42.720 --> 44:46.417
The girl is going to be fine.
I trained in Europe.

44:46.490 --> 44:48.287
Really?

44:48.359 --> 44:51.123
Maggie, I know we've had
our differences in the past, but...

44:52.396 --> 44:55.331
Maggie, I came as soon as I heard.
I was at the gym.

44:55.399 --> 44:58.197
Father Cory told me about
your experience at the soup kitchen.

44:58.269 --> 45:01.170
- Are you all right?
- Bolt?

45:02.340 --> 45:04.331
I didn't realize you'd be here.

45:04.408 --> 45:06.273
Well, I am.

45:07.812 --> 45:11.646
Rod, I'd like you to meet
my husband Bolt.

45:11.716 --> 45:14.048
Dr. Rad Rondall. Rod Randall.

45:14.118 --> 45:16.052
He's an old friend of the family.

45:16.120 --> 45:19.556
He's been studying on the Continent.

45:38.075 --> 45:39.337
Hello, Mother.

45:41.412 --> 45:43.505
I need a moment alone.

46:11.642 --> 46:15.669
Maggie, I've thought
about nothing except...

46:15.746 --> 46:17.543
what we once...

46:19.350 --> 46:21.443
I'm sorry. I forgot the lines.

46:21.519 --> 46:24.113
 - Can I do that again?
- Are we still rolling?

46:24.188 --> 46:26.748
 - Ready when you are.
- I'm sorry. One more time.

46:26.824 --> 46:29.122
 We'll pick it up from the kiss.

46:29.193 --> 46:30.626
Right.

46:43.140 --> 46:47.474
I've thought about nothing,
except what we once were.

46:47.545 --> 46:49.570
How we...

46:49.647 --> 46:53.413
Sorry. I just didn't
feel anything. One more time?

47:06.864 --> 47:10.391
I've thought about nothing except
what we once were. We made magic.

47:10.468 --> 47:12.129
 That's a cut.

47:12.203 --> 47:14.398
That one was good for me.

47:18.576 --> 47:20.510
Special scene, sweetheart.

47:22.713 --> 47:26.240
Don't you dare run away from me.
That was unprofessional.

47:26.317 --> 47:30.310
That was? What was that crock
you were trying to pull on me?

47:30.387 --> 47:33.413
I was trying to get the scene right.
You know I'm a perfectionist.

47:33.491 --> 47:36.949
Things are hard for me right now
in life and on the show. Okay?

47:37.027 --> 47:40.827
Things were hard for me 20 years ago
when you left me for dead!

47:40.898 --> 47:43.992
And you're back to return the favor?
This is some kind of revenge thing?

47:44.068 --> 47:46.263
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm here for me!

47:46.337 --> 47:49.500
I got a chance at a career,
and I'm not gonna blow it!

47:49.573 --> 47:52.007
David's going to help me produce
my one-man  Hamlet  off-Broadway.

47:52.076 --> 47:54.271
The world is going
to rediscover a major talent.

47:54.345 --> 47:55.642
You believe David?

47:57.615 --> 48:01.449
Trying to get rid of me won't work.
I won't go back to Florida.

48:01.519 --> 48:05.080
You try playing Willy Loman in front
of old farts eating meat loaf!

48:05.155 --> 48:08.124
Chewing and slurping
and spitting out their pits.

48:08.192 --> 48:11.320
Every night listening to them
coughing and hocking!

48:11.395 --> 48:14.023
I was in hell!
Consigned there by you!

48:14.098 --> 48:16.623
What happened to your career
was not my fault!

48:16.700 --> 48:19.533
- That's not how I see it.
- If I hurt you, I'm really sorry.

48:19.603 --> 48:22.663
- I was very young.
- Not anymore, babe.

48:23.774 --> 48:27.175
What's your hurry anyway?
Gotta get to the mall?

48:44.361 --> 48:47.387
Give them my best in Paramus.

48:51.101 --> 48:52.625
Oh, yummy!

48:52.703 --> 48:54.136
With a spoon.

48:54.204 --> 48:56.468
He's mine.
You touch, you die.

48:56.540 --> 48:58.701
I wouldn't dream of it.
He's perfect for you.

49:04.702 --> 49:07.330
Excuse me.
Can I join you?

49:07.405 --> 49:10.203
I'm Lori Craven,
the homeless mute.

49:10.275 --> 49:13.733
Of course. You speak beautifully
for a mute.

49:13.811 --> 49:15.745
- Please.
- Thank you.

49:19.450 --> 49:22.010
That was quite a scene
with you and Celeste.

49:22.086 --> 49:23.178
Thank you.

49:23.254 --> 49:26.018
No, I meant after, after.

49:26.090 --> 49:29.856
Oh, that. Well, there's a bit
of history there, I'm afraid.

49:29.928 --> 49:33.386
Yeah, she said you were
on the show in the old days.

49:33.464 --> 49:35.898
"The old days." Yes.

49:35.967 --> 49:39.403
So long ago that we had cigarette
commercials done by doctors.

49:39.470 --> 49:41.165
Really?

49:42.574 --> 49:45.839
- Could I ask you a small favor?
- Anything.

49:45.910 --> 49:48.003
Give my aunt a break.

49:48.079 --> 49:50.377
Gladly.
Who's your aunt?

49:50.448 --> 49:52.348
Celeste is my aunt.

49:52.417 --> 49:54.942
- Celeste is your aunt?
- Yeah.

49:55.019 --> 49:59.319
I know this is none of my business,
but she feels threatened right now.

49:59.390 --> 50:02.325
This place is crawling
with subplots.

50:02.393 --> 50:05.260
So you're her niece.
The beautiful little mute.

50:05.330 --> 50:07.798
I see the resemblance.
Of course.

50:07.865 --> 50:09.457
Determined little chin.

50:09.534 --> 50:12.526
Exactly! And the hands.

50:14.038 --> 50:16.802
More expressive than Celeste's.
May I?

50:22.480 --> 50:26.610
Hands say so much about a person.
Don't you think?

50:26.684 --> 50:29.778
Tell me about your family again,
what they're like.

50:29.854 --> 50:33.483
You know. I've told you. You trying
to give me gas? Forget it.

50:33.558 --> 50:35.856
Have you ever done anything
really horrible to them?

50:35.927 --> 50:38.725
Aside from naming my twins
Venus and Saturn...

50:38.796 --> 50:41.663
which was grist for the mill
for ten years?

50:41.733 --> 50:45.362
Ten years! And my mother
finally forgave me a year ago.

50:45.436 --> 50:48.098
But she keeps bringing it up
at public holidays.

50:48.172 --> 50:51.664
I should be taken out and shot
for what I've done to mine.

50:51.743 --> 50:54.303
What are you talking about?
You've been great to Lori.

50:54.379 --> 50:56.870
You've written her,
sent her presents.

50:58.249 --> 50:59.511
What?

50:59.584 --> 51:00.710
I don't know.

51:00.785 --> 51:02.878
- Why are you crying?
- I don't know!

51:02.954 --> 51:04.478
Then quit it!

51:04.555 --> 51:09.015
It's so great to have her here
living with me for these two weeks.

51:09.093 --> 51:12.119
To have her to talk to.
We talk about anything.

51:12.196 --> 51:15.427
Nothing. About the weather.
What we're going to wear.

51:16.567 --> 51:18.535
She's grown up so nice,
don't you think?

51:18.603 --> 51:21.003
- She's gorgeous.
- She's such a lady.

51:21.072 --> 51:23.199
I'm so lucky!

51:24.275 --> 51:25.902
Oh, Jesus.

51:25.977 --> 51:28.002
- I'm going to get some flowers.
- Don't go.

51:28.079 --> 51:30.775
What do you mean? Let me go.
You're standing in the street.

51:30.848 --> 51:33.476
All right.
Don't worry about me.

51:49.734 --> 51:50.996
What?

51:51.069 --> 51:53.003
Tell the twins I love them.

51:53.071 --> 51:56.131
Will you stop already?

51:56.207 --> 51:59.267
You want roses or carnations?

51:59.344 --> 52:01.312
Should give you poison ivy.

52:14.292 --> 52:17.523
-It's Maggie from  The Sun Also Sets!
-Would you sign this?

52:20.531 --> 52:23.193
You think I should take
movement classes?

52:23.267 --> 52:24.700
Absolutely important.

52:24.769 --> 52:28.068
When I was in  Death of a Salesman,
for instance...

52:28.139 --> 52:30.471
You did  Death of a Salesman?

52:30.541 --> 52:33.169
God! Playing...

52:33.244 --> 52:35.974
Willy. What can I say?

52:36.047 --> 52:37.537
I'm very impressed.

52:37.615 --> 52:41.608
- That sounds adolescent...
- It was in a nothing theater.

52:41.686 --> 52:44.985
But all the time
I was obsessed with my hands.

52:45.056 --> 52:48.958
I made them feel
like salesmen's hands.

52:49.026 --> 52:50.118
Really?

52:50.194 --> 52:53.220
You mean manicured or clumsy?

52:53.297 --> 52:54.855
Exactly.

52:54.932 --> 52:59.096
Hands that had written out
all those invoices.

52:59.904 --> 53:02.065
Hands that reach out for Howard...

53:02.140 --> 53:04.233
pleading for his job.

53:09.113 --> 53:11.377
Am I going too fast?
Just say so.

53:11.449 --> 53:13.417
Jeffrey, I really like you.

53:13.484 --> 53:15.179
You do?

53:15.253 --> 53:16.686
Yes!

53:16.754 --> 53:19.314
But the hand thing...

53:19.390 --> 53:21.756
it started to sound rehearsed.

53:26.063 --> 53:27.496
Rehearsed?

53:28.900 --> 53:30.834
Maybe I need new material.

53:30.902 --> 53:34.463
I mean, talk.
Like ourselves.

53:39.877 --> 53:42.311
- Would you like to have dinner?
- Yes.

53:42.380 --> 53:45.975
- With me? Just like that?
- Yeah, just like that.

53:46.050 --> 53:49.577
 Why is Jeffrey back?
 Rose, why is he back?

53:49.654 --> 53:52.282
You've got to kill him off. Get him
out of town. Give him a disease.

53:52.356 --> 53:55.018
I can't. The boys upstairs
are very happy about this.

53:55.092 --> 53:57.026
- Then I'll quit.
- Good idea.

53:57.094 --> 53:59.756
Oh, you know I won't quit.
Why do you say, "Good idea"?

53:59.831 --> 54:02.823
I'm home! Hello!
Hi, Rose.

54:02.900 --> 54:05.994
Hi, honey.
Did you have a nice evening?

54:06.070 --> 54:08.004
He was very charming!

54:08.072 --> 54:09.596
- Who?
-Jeffrey Anderson.

54:09.674 --> 54:12.234
Didn't I tell you
I was going out with him?

54:12.310 --> 54:13.868
Oh, my God!

54:20.518 --> 54:23.214
What is the matter?
What's the matter?

54:23.287 --> 54:25.346
What do you mean, what's the matter?

54:25.423 --> 54:29.257
- They went to dinner. So?
- He's not entitled to.

54:29.327 --> 54:31.818
- Oh, God! God!
- She's a big girl.

54:31.896 --> 54:34.091
She can defend herself.

54:34.165 --> 54:37.191
You know, to the outside eye,
to the person...

54:37.268 --> 54:40.169
who doesn't know what a forgiving,
wonderful person you can be...

54:40.238 --> 54:42.570
this could look
like you're jealous.

54:43.708 --> 54:46.700
How do your parents feel
about you living in this cesspool?

54:46.777 --> 54:48.506
They're dead.

54:48.579 --> 54:50.809
Oh, it's okay.

54:50.882 --> 54:54.340
My grandma raised me,
and I've always had Aunt Celeste.

54:57.255 --> 54:58.688
Aunt Celeste.

54:58.756 --> 55:00.621
What?

55:00.691 --> 55:05.185
I just have trouble imagining her
related to anyone...

55:05.263 --> 55:06.924
you know, human.

55:16.774 --> 55:19.766
-Celeste said to stay away from you.
-Really? Why?

55:19.844 --> 55:22.438
She said you were dangerous.

55:22.513 --> 55:23.980
Really?

55:24.048 --> 55:25.982
Are you, Dr. Randall?

55:26.984 --> 55:28.576
Only when I operate.

55:45.136 --> 55:48.594
Good evening. I have an appointment
with Mr. Anderson.

55:48.673 --> 55:50.607
- Now?
- No, not now.

55:50.675 --> 55:53.735
Tomorrow, actually.
I was just in the neighborhood.

55:53.811 --> 55:55.745
Thought I would double-check.
He's in 11 -A?

55:55.813 --> 55:56.973
2-D.

55:57.048 --> 55:59.209
2-D. Of course.

56:01.385 --> 56:05.287
I was confusing it with my shrink.
He's in 11 -A.

56:05.356 --> 56:06.839
Another building, of course.

56:06.973 --> 56:08.804
So, thanks a lot.

56:08.875 --> 56:11.070
And see you tomorrow.

56:11.144 --> 56:14.773
Probably in the morning.
Elevenish. You'll be here?

56:14.847 --> 56:16.940
No, the day man will be on.

56:17.016 --> 56:20.543
Of course. They can't work you
24 hours a day.

56:26.559 --> 56:30.518
Thank you very much.
I'll take good care of it.

56:35.935 --> 56:39.302
Listen, I have something
I have to say.

56:39.372 --> 56:41.397
What?

56:41.474 --> 56:44.443
When I first asked you out...

56:44.510 --> 56:47.673
I did it to make Celeste jealous.

56:47.747 --> 56:49.180
I knew that.

56:49.248 --> 56:51.808
You did?
But that's not the case anymore.

56:51.884 --> 56:54.614
- I genuinely like you.
- Good.

56:54.687 --> 56:57.622
- I really had fun hanging out.
- I like you a lot.

56:57.690 --> 56:59.248
It was fun.

57:00.326 --> 57:01.759
Good.

57:17.310 --> 57:19.335
See you in surgery.

58:12.465 --> 58:15.525
Jeffrey! Jeff!

58:15.601 --> 58:17.694
Help me! Help!

58:23.743 --> 58:25.734
You're kidding!

58:25.811 --> 58:28.177
Jeffrey, please?

58:30.883 --> 58:32.373
Knock it off!

58:33.920 --> 58:37.754
I'm gonna call the police!
Be quiet!

58:38.991 --> 58:41.391
Oh, dear,
now look what you've done.

58:41.460 --> 58:43.428
I hope you're wearing underwear.

58:44.497 --> 58:46.328
Dare I ask?

58:47.400 --> 58:50.995
I'm lost? I'm not familiar
with the neighborhood?

58:51.070 --> 58:53.004
You've got a nice view of it
from up here.

58:53.072 --> 58:55.097
Here we go. I got you.

58:55.174 --> 58:57.142
Here we are.

58:57.209 --> 59:00.804
I got you, I got you. Okay.

59:00.880 --> 59:04.543
- My back!
- I got you. It's okay.

59:12.124 --> 59:14.217
You sure that's why you're here?

59:14.293 --> 59:17.057
Get your hands off my...

59:17.129 --> 59:19.495
God, you're so disgusting!

59:25.905 --> 59:27.463
Lori? Lori?

59:29.408 --> 59:32.536
Lori, get your clothes on!
Your aunt's here.

59:32.612 --> 59:35.172
You lowlife, lecherous...

59:35.247 --> 59:36.680
Lori!

59:38.150 --> 59:40.084
She left ten minutes ago.

59:40.152 --> 59:42.416
Don't insult my intelligence.

59:49.128 --> 59:50.561
Shit!

59:53.065 --> 59:55.295
Why are you here?

59:55.368 --> 59:57.598
This is my apartment.
I live here.

59:57.670 --> 59:59.604
Why are you here?

59:59.672 --> 01:00:04.075
I'll tell you why I'm here.
Oh, I'll tell you why I'm here!

01:00:04.143 --> 01:00:06.771
I'm here because...

01:00:06.846 --> 01:00:09.007
Go on, say it.

01:00:09.081 --> 01:00:11.311
- l...
- Go on, say it!

01:00:11.384 --> 01:00:13.545
I want you, Jeffrey.

01:00:13.619 --> 01:00:17.555
I'm consumed with jealousy for my
niece because I want you for myself.

01:00:17.623 --> 01:00:20.615
- Oh, please!
- Admit you have feelings for me.

01:00:20.693 --> 01:00:23.856
I have feelings about you, not
for you. There's a big difference.

01:00:23.929 --> 01:00:26.693
You're ashamed of them,
but you still have the feelings.

01:00:26.766 --> 01:00:30.566
You realize what a mistake it was
throwing me out 110 years ago.

01:00:30.636 --> 01:00:33.901
You're exactly the same. Even
for an actor, you're an egomaniac!

01:00:33.973 --> 01:00:38.740
Of course. I've got America's
sweetheart climbing up my drainpipe!

01:00:38.811 --> 01:00:41.473
I didn't know it was your drainpipe.
I thought it was someone else's.

01:00:41.547 --> 01:00:43.606
No, you knew it was mine.
Your eyes, they're burning.

01:00:43.683 --> 01:00:45.878
- I've got the flu!
- No, they're burning with passion.

01:00:45.951 --> 01:00:48.511
- You're full of shit.
- Of course, but not about that!

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:58.557
There.
I'm sorry. I had to do that.

01:00:58.631 --> 01:01:00.064
Fine.

01:01:02.802 --> 01:01:04.736
Stay away from my niece.

01:01:15.381 --> 01:01:18.748
- You'll be back!
- Like hell I will.

01:01:28.107 --> 01:01:31.099
So, she's jealous of the mute?
This'll kill her.

01:01:31.176 --> 01:01:33.701
- Yeah. This is great.
- Next line.

01:01:33.779 --> 01:01:37.806
Got it.
"Then Angelique says..."

01:01:37.883 --> 01:01:40.374
Angelique's a mute, okay?
Angelique grunts.

01:01:40.452 --> 01:01:42.852
Yeah? Grunts?
I don't know about...

01:01:42.921 --> 01:01:45.287
Then stage direction.

01:01:45.357 --> 01:01:48.724
Later. "Too weak to take another
step, Angelique collapses.

01:01:48.794 --> 01:01:51.126
Dr. Randall..." later...
"Randall sweeps her into his arms...

01:01:51.196 --> 01:01:52.925
and kisses her passionately."

01:01:52.998 --> 01:01:55.865
Close-up. Fade to commercial.

01:01:55.934 --> 01:01:57.993
- Go. Go!
- You know, this actually works.

01:02:00.405 --> 01:02:02.202
 Let me just
 get something straight.

01:02:02.274 --> 01:02:05.766
 Isn't Celeste Talbert
 Jeffrey Anderson's love interest?

01:02:05.844 --> 01:02:10.213
Yes, but with the introduction
of the youthful Angelique...

01:02:10.282 --> 01:02:13.080
Lori Craven,
we have created a triangle.

01:02:13.152 --> 01:02:15.484
And that allows us to explore
a contemporary theme...

01:02:15.554 --> 01:02:17.818
which is very close
to Miss Talbert's heart...

01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:22.054
today's woman as she gets dried-up,
old and sexually undesirable.

01:02:22.127 --> 01:02:24.186
It works.

01:02:25.998 --> 01:02:27.863
Aren't you supposed
to be down there taping?

01:02:27.933 --> 01:02:31.266
- I'm not in the scene.
- Of course you're in the scene.

01:02:31.336 --> 01:02:34.066
Maggie's gotta be there when they
discover Angelique's brain tumor.

01:02:34.139 --> 01:02:37.939
- You paid for it.
- Rose, they told me I'm not in it.

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:41.502
- It's a new scene. I'm not in it.
- A new scene?

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.344
I didn't write any new scene.

01:02:50.856 --> 01:02:54.189
The only way she'll find
her strength is if she tries.

01:02:54.259 --> 01:02:57.194
- And if she falls, we're here.
- What is this?

01:02:57.262 --> 01:02:59.526
What are you doing?
I didn't write this.

01:03:00.265 --> 01:03:03.962
Dr. Randall, it's no secret
what's going on here.

01:03:05.437 --> 01:03:07.701
What is this?
What are you doin' to me?

01:03:07.773 --> 01:03:10.173
Where's the goddamn script?

01:03:11.276 --> 01:03:14.905
Anyone can see it. You're falling
in love with Angelique...

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.778
deeply, wildly in love.

01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:20.011
What about your Hippocratic oath?

01:03:20.085 --> 01:03:23.612
I cannot stand by
and let this happen.

01:03:23.689 --> 01:03:27.022
l, too, have an oath...
a nurse's oath.

01:03:27.092 --> 01:03:29.959
A nurse's...
Oh, please. A nurse's oath?

01:03:30.028 --> 01:03:33.623
You're out of line, Nurse Nan!
Besides, Angelique can read lips.

01:03:37.302 --> 01:03:38.291
Yes.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.011
Don't!

01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:59.755
- Somebody help!
- Get off!

01:03:59.825 --> 01:04:02.760
- Celeste, will you...
- You're crazy. Get off me.

01:04:02.828 --> 01:04:05.388
You can't kiss her!
Don't you dare kiss that girl!

01:04:05.464 --> 01:04:08.399
- You're on television!
- Are you out of your mind?

01:04:08.467 --> 01:04:11.129
- Don't you dare!
- Get her off me! You're crazy!

01:04:11.203 --> 01:04:14.001
- You're nuts!
- Don't you dare kiss her.

01:04:14.072 --> 01:04:17.007
- You can never kiss her!
- Of course I can kiss her!

01:04:17.075 --> 01:04:20.738
Oh, this is ridiculous!
I can kiss who I want!

01:04:20.812 --> 01:04:24.111
No, you can't!
You can't kiss her!

01:04:24.182 --> 01:04:27.982
- Why? Because she's your niece?
- No, you nitwit!

01:04:28.053 --> 01:04:33.355
Because she's my daughter
and your daughter.

01:04:33.425 --> 01:04:35.859
- What?
- What are you talking about?

01:04:35.928 --> 01:04:39.193
We're her parents... you and I.

01:04:39.264 --> 01:04:41.630
We're her mommy and her daddy.

01:04:49.374 --> 01:04:52.309
It was our fourth date.
Summer, 1970?

01:04:52.377 --> 01:04:55.540
Shakespeare in the Park?
The bottle of Chardonnay?

01:04:55.614 --> 01:04:57.980
All's well that ends well.

01:05:06.658 --> 01:05:09.593
- We're still rolling?
- Yeah. Fabulous.

01:05:09.661 --> 01:05:13.927
I got pregnant,
and I was so young.

01:05:13.999 --> 01:05:18.936
And the show made me sign a paper
saying I'd never mention the baby.

01:05:20.639 --> 01:05:24.769
So I went home to Iowa,
and I had you.

01:05:24.843 --> 01:05:27.744
And I gave you to Grandma
to raise.

01:05:27.813 --> 01:05:31.579
And I made up a twin sister, Simone,
who died in a car wreck...

01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:34.414
said she was your actual mom.

01:05:34.486 --> 01:05:37.182
And then the show
told everyone I had T.B...

01:05:37.255 --> 01:05:41.351
and sent my character to
a sanitarium in Tierra del Fuego.

01:05:41.426 --> 01:05:43.587
Why can't I write shit
like this?

01:05:43.662 --> 01:05:49.225
After I came back from having Lori,
I was terrible to you.

01:05:49.301 --> 01:05:52.759
I know that. I know that.
All right?

01:05:52.838 --> 01:05:54.772
I blamed you
for messing up my whole life...

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.105
so I had you written off the show
so you'd disappear.

01:05:58.176 --> 01:06:00.940
And you did!

01:06:03.648 --> 01:06:07.778
Now you're all back,
and I've ruined three lives!

01:06:07.853 --> 01:06:10.481
Three lives!

01:06:10.555 --> 01:06:14.082
Me, America's sweetheart!

01:06:16.061 --> 01:06:17.995
Oh, God!

01:06:19.531 --> 01:06:21.226
This is fuckin' great.

01:06:26.271 --> 01:06:27.636
Pumpkin.

01:06:28.807 --> 01:06:30.502
Oh, God.

01:06:33.278 --> 01:06:35.405
-Jeffrey.
- Stay away from me.

01:07:13.518 --> 01:07:14.985
That worked nicely.

01:07:15.053 --> 01:07:18.147
Thanks for the scoop.
That was incredible.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:24.270
Celeste was never more moving.
She was brilliant. She stays.

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:28.433
I do know
she's not gonna work with us.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.550
Got a minute?

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:39.315
- Mr. Barnes?
- Mr. Edwards...

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:42.483
Someone forget to tell me
about the meeting? I guess so.

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:46.392
Mr. Edwards,
what happened to Celeste was...

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:48.692
Brought on by a flagrant abuse
of prescription drugs.

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:52.030
Exactly. Thank you. We've had this
in the dark long enough, haven't we?

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:55.434
- What?
- She'll be fired by the end of day.

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:57.200
- Who said fired?
- He said.

01:07:57.273 --> 01:08:00.970
- We can't tolerate this behavior.
- Tolerate!

01:08:01.044 --> 01:08:04.411
Could you tolerate the
one billion dollars of free press...

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.244
we're gonna get because
of what happened down there today?

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:11.777
The phone's been ringing off the
hook. We'll be on the evening news.

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:15.449
The tabloids are going
to say "real-life soap opera."

01:08:15.525 --> 01:08:18.517
Celeste is a bad-news buffet.

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:23.429
The people love her because she is
and always will be queen of misery.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.801
She's turned unstable,
and we can't...

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:31.395
Unstable? I'm stable.
Who wants to watch me on television?

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:36.411
Unstable is her talent. She's been
through hell, and we're her family.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:40.006
- In a crisis, we must support her.
- Yeah.

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.640
We have to love her.

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:43.447
We have to care about her.

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:47.511
And we have to milk it for every
drop of publicity we can get.

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:51.252
- I think it's a damn miracle.
- I'd say "amen."

01:08:56.698 --> 01:09:00.760
 - T.D.K.
 - World Entertainment Network.

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:03.328
 Now, an amazing day in the life
 of  The Sun Also Sets.

01:09:03.406 --> 01:09:07.774
 Celeste Talbert, America's
 sweetheart, tells she's not sweet.

01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:10.813
-  Don't you dare!
-  Pin her wrists.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.179
 You can't kiss her!
 You can't ever kiss her!

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.808
God.

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:19.912
-  You can't ever kiss her!
-  Of course I can kiss her!

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:22.048
 I can kiss who I want!

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:28.395
Lori, give us a smile.

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:31.228
- Lori, over here.
- Look over here.

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:34.029
Do it, Lori.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:41.068
Come on back.
Come on, Miss Craven.

01:09:42.944 --> 01:09:44.377
Come on.

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:53.783
- Pose.
- Yeah.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:55.346
Lori, come on.

01:09:59.062 --> 01:10:00.427
Do something. Come on.

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:02.327
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:07.995
Could I have your autograph,
Miss Talbert?

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:15.705
Thank you.

01:10:17.346 --> 01:10:19.177
 I was as shocked as you were.

01:10:19.248 --> 01:10:23.344
I mean, I hope you don't think
that I really would've...

01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:25.148
I would've.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:28.452
Yes, well.
I mean, who wouldn't?

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:31.857
- Luckily something held us back.
- Can you imagine?

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:34.055
Yes, I can. I did.

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:37.361
One more date, we would've
had a Greek tragedy on our hands.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.627
Lori, l...

01:10:42.271 --> 01:10:45.104
My daughter, Lori. God!

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:51.740
I just wanna say that...

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:57.343
I know you must be feeling
incredibly strong emotions now...

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:01.220
but I would like it very much
if the friendship we had...

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:04.555
could phase...

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:08.427
into a father /daughter arrangement.

01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:11.365
- Yeah.
- Not right away. You must hate me.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:14.460
- I don't hate you. I blame her.
- Good!

01:11:14.537 --> 01:11:17.597
- You had no idea.
- None!

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:19.641
Come in! It's open!

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:26.012
Great. Family reunion.

01:11:26.082 --> 01:11:28.846
We should take out some pictures.

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:33.555
We can speak later, Lori.

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.693
Sweetie.

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:46.127
Nothing has happened
that can't be made better.

01:11:47.203 --> 01:11:50.661
Nothing has happened? You've
been deceiving me for 20 years...

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:54.437
in the most unbelievably calculated
fashion, and nothing has happened?

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:56.705
God. You don't know
how sorry I am.

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:59.145
- I haven't slept a wink.
- Try sleeping pills.

01:11:59.215 --> 01:12:01.683
Yeah. Well, that's a good idea.

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:05.084
I know I've been deceitful,
but I had my reasons.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:08.385
Maybe they were dumb reasons,
but they were reasons.

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:11.392
Hell. I'm not a genius;
I'm just a working actress.

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:18.857
I never said I was the best mother
in the world.

01:12:18.935 --> 01:12:21.699
Give me a little credit, will you,
credit for being someone...

01:12:21.771 --> 01:12:26.367
who tried to love you
the only way she knew how.

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:28.975
I know that speech.

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:33.510
- You do?
- It was the Thanksgiving show...

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:36.313
when Maggie
meets Bolt's blind nephew.

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:38.717
Oh, God.

01:12:39.589 --> 01:12:42.752
- Get out.
- Please try to understand.

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:46.556
- I don't give a shit.
- No need to use that language.

01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:48.392
Get out!

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:54.201
Now!

01:13:06.449 --> 01:13:09.714
They love her. It's a phenomenon.
This is a nightmare.

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:12.879
You promised me you would
get rid of Celeste!

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:15.446
We were both naked,
and you promised!

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:18.118
- Naked!
- Hey, we were never naked.

01:13:18.194 --> 01:13:19.991
We could've been!

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:23.429
Not only didn't you get rid
of Celeste, you created Lori...

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:25.194
this ingenue from hell!

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:28.863
She has more lines than I do,
and she's a goddamn mute!

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:32.374
- Whoa, whoa! Not anymore.
- Not anymore what?

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:35.643
- Not any more lines?
- Not any more mute.

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:39.707
Word from upstairs. Next week, she
recovers her voice and speaks again.

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:43.717
You're shitting me, right?
She'll take over the show.

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:47.313
- What can I say?
- You're enjoying this.

01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:49.756
I'm not enjoying this. It's great
for me. The ratings are flying.

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:51.986
Well, it ain't good for me!

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:58.400
We need to talk. Look, I don't care
what Tawny Miller says...

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:01.527
this hat makes me look
like that goddamn Tweety Bird.

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:05.197
Do you mind?

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:08.300
You, you're asking me to leave?

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:11.744
That's right.
I'm asking you to leave.

01:14:13.516 --> 01:14:16.250
Miss Moorehead, may Miss Craven
and I have a moment alone, please?

01:14:23.457 --> 01:14:25.823
No problem.

01:14:25.893 --> 01:14:27.827
I'm a professional.

01:14:29.463 --> 01:14:31.397
I do things professionally.

01:14:36.571 --> 01:14:39.131
I hate you!
I hate you, you pig!

01:14:46.681 --> 01:14:50.447
- She's got a lot of spirit.
- She's a deranged bitch.

01:14:50.518 --> 01:14:54.181
I couldn't agree more.
About the hat...

01:15:04.699 --> 01:15:07.327
I have been very patient, God.

01:15:08.502 --> 01:15:11.630
This is my moment.
I have to seize it.

01:15:13.674 --> 01:15:16.199
I know you'll understand.

01:15:22.116 --> 01:15:24.778
- Can I talk to you?
- No. I'm going to work.

01:15:24.852 --> 01:15:27.912
It's about Lori. I don't
expect you to be nice to me.

01:15:27.989 --> 01:15:30.719
I don't expect you to forgive me.
What I did was horrible.

01:15:32.894 --> 01:15:36.523
Dinner theater is horrible. Doing
hemorrhoid commercials is horrible.

01:15:36.597 --> 01:15:39.930
-There are not words for your deeds.
-But this isn't about me.

01:15:40.534 --> 01:15:42.764
- What's it about?
- It's about Lori.

01:15:44.372 --> 01:15:46.431
You have to talk to her.
She won't talk to me.

01:15:46.507 --> 01:15:49.067
She'll talk to you.
She needs you, Jeffrey.

01:15:49.143 --> 01:15:51.373
- You're her father.
- I can't be in the same room.

01:15:51.445 --> 01:15:53.743
I don't know how to be a father.
I don't know how to behave!

01:15:53.814 --> 01:15:56.146
- Sure you do.
- What would I do? What would I say?

01:15:56.217 --> 01:15:58.515
You go to her door
and knock on it.

01:15:58.586 --> 01:16:02.545
- And say what?
- Say, "Hi, Lori. It's your dad."

01:16:04.625 --> 01:16:07.992
- I can't do that!
- Do it! Try it!

01:16:08.062 --> 01:16:10.530
Lori, open up. It's your dad.

01:16:10.598 --> 01:16:13.897
Don't do it like that.
Use your real voice.

01:16:20.574 --> 01:16:22.508
- Hi, Lori. It's your dad.
- Yes.

01:16:22.576 --> 01:16:24.271
- Felt good. Now what?
- Yes.

01:16:24.345 --> 01:16:27.405
You step in the room, and you say...

01:16:27.481 --> 01:16:30.109
"I know I haven't been here
for you before...

01:16:30.184 --> 01:16:33.551
but I am your father,
and I'm here for you now."

01:16:37.291 --> 01:16:39.691
I know I haven't
been here for you before...

01:16:41.395 --> 01:16:44.558
but I am your father,
and I'm here for you now.

01:16:44.632 --> 01:16:46.827
- Yes. Yes.
- Now what?

01:16:46.901 --> 01:16:51.167
And then cross to her,
put your arm around her...

01:16:51.238 --> 01:16:54.105
hold her... yes.

01:17:00.815 --> 01:17:05.047
The rocking is great.
Keep the rocking.

01:17:05.119 --> 01:17:09.522
And then say,
"Everything will be okay."

01:17:12.159 --> 01:17:13.820
Everything will be okay.

01:17:16.797 --> 01:17:18.059
Really?

01:17:19.133 --> 01:17:22.591
- Did you believe it?
- Yes.

01:17:24.205 --> 01:17:26.139
Then it will.

01:17:29.477 --> 01:17:31.138
Hi, guys.

01:17:33.881 --> 01:17:37.339
Excuse me for a second.
This is kind of important.

01:17:37.418 --> 01:17:42.321
I am such a ninny. I left my scarf
at your place the other night.

01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:44.858
Could you bring it in tomorrow?

01:17:49.096 --> 01:17:51.792
- What?
- I was right.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.991
- You'll be a superb father.
- Wait a minute.

01:17:55.069 --> 01:17:57.333
You don't actually believe
that I slept with her?

01:17:57.405 --> 01:18:00.203
I think you'd sleep with anybody,
but, God, Montana?

01:18:00.274 --> 01:18:02.572
- I feel nauseous.
- You wanna believe it, believe it.

01:18:02.643 --> 01:18:05.168
It's none of your business anyhow.
Just get out of my life!

01:18:05.246 --> 01:18:07.714
Wait one minute. This is my life.
You get out.

01:18:07.782 --> 01:18:10.012
I'm going nowhere, babe.
Get used to it.

01:18:17.291 --> 01:18:20.988
Ready on two. Take three.

01:18:21.062 --> 01:18:22.324
I mean two.

01:18:23.264 --> 01:18:25.425
Dear Angelique.

01:18:25.499 --> 01:18:27.524
 Dear Angelique.

01:18:28.636 --> 01:18:31.104
-  Dear Angelique.
- I produce a soap opera.

01:18:31.172 --> 01:18:32.571
David, look.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:37.737
- She's shitting all over Celeste.
- I know. It's very exciting.

01:18:38.846 --> 01:18:40.780
...inspires us all.

01:18:43.117 --> 01:18:45.381
-  That's a cut.
- For Christ's sake!

01:18:45.453 --> 01:18:47.887
I can't believe I'm having
to put up with this.

01:18:47.955 --> 01:18:51.118
- Goddamn it. Don't think of it.
- Excuse me, Miss Talbert.

01:18:51.192 --> 01:18:55.652
- You and Jeffrey Anderson?
- It's something I couldn't hide.

01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:58.527
It was important for me
to come forward.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.262
Important as an actress...

01:19:02.336 --> 01:19:05.464
as a woman and as a personality.

01:19:07.441 --> 01:19:09.375
- Have you got a light?
- I don't.

01:19:09.443 --> 01:19:11.707
I need a light.
Why won't anyone give me a light?

01:19:11.779 --> 01:19:14.771
- There you are.
- Rose! Rose, are you talking to me?

01:19:14.849 --> 01:19:17.044
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:19:17.118 --> 01:19:19.916
- Have you got a light?
- Yeah.

01:19:19.987 --> 01:19:21.784
- I guess I deserve this pain.
- What am I doing?

01:19:21.856 --> 01:19:24.324
I guess it's God's will.
I don't know how long I can take it.

01:19:24.391 --> 01:19:26.916
Show after show after show, and...

01:19:31.832 --> 01:19:34.460
- That pig.
- Which one?

01:19:38.272 --> 01:19:40.570
- Bitch.
- It's horseshit!

01:19:40.641 --> 01:19:42.802
- What else are you gonna say?
- Listen to me.

01:19:42.877 --> 01:19:45.846
- Please, will you just hear me out?
- No! You're disgusting.

01:19:45.913 --> 01:19:49.576
You run around
with your fly open like a...

01:19:49.650 --> 01:19:52.915
Eww! You are my father! For
God's sake, will you act like it?

01:19:52.987 --> 01:19:56.354
I'm not surprised.
Montana is desperate for publicity.

01:19:56.423 --> 01:19:58.789
You're not surprised.
I'm surprised.

01:19:58.859 --> 01:20:00.793
I feel that
I should be a part of this.

01:20:01.762 --> 01:20:03.696
- Oh, God.
- Great.

01:20:03.764 --> 01:20:06.255
You people have the morals
of guinea pigs.

01:20:06.333 --> 01:20:09.268
How could you?

01:20:09.336 --> 01:20:11.930
You? Moralizing? Please!

01:20:12.006 --> 01:20:15.999
- Hasn't she been through enough?
- Don't you dare take my side.

01:20:20.848 --> 01:20:25.876
- How could you do that to her?
- I never touched Montana Moorehead.

01:20:25.953 --> 01:20:28.922
But if you don't believe me, don't.
I don't care.

01:20:28.989 --> 01:20:31.480
My career has suffered other slings
and arrows, and you know what?

01:20:31.559 --> 01:20:33.959
I survived them.
I'll survive this too.

01:20:34.028 --> 01:20:36.861
You know what I'll do?
I'll take my  Hamlet  up to Canada.

01:20:36.931 --> 01:20:41.300
They always loved me in Canada.
What an awful picture! Jesus!

01:20:41.368 --> 01:20:43.563
I've never worked in an atmosphere
like this before.

01:20:43.637 --> 01:20:46.868
This pregnancy thing is a scam.
I resent being treated like a leper.

01:20:46.941 --> 01:20:49.808
Having to work with those two
is a personal nightmare for me.

01:20:49.877 --> 01:20:53.313
- I'm on the verge of a breakdown.
- I'm on the verge of a breakdown.

01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:58.340
- I could have a breakdown.
- Imagine facing them every day.

01:20:58.419 --> 01:21:03.550
It seems to get harder and harder,
and I devoted my life to this show.

01:21:07.595 --> 01:21:09.756
Mr. Edwards, it's them or me.

01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:12.856
That is the bottom line here.
They go, or I go.

01:21:12.933 --> 01:21:15.561
This is the toughest decision
I've ever had to make...

01:21:15.636 --> 01:21:20.403
but I get paid 1 .2 million dollars
to make these kind of decisions...

01:21:20.474 --> 01:21:22.408
so here it is.

01:21:26.413 --> 01:21:27.846
Yeah?

01:21:31.452 --> 01:21:34.182
- Dr. Demonico?
- Can we talk?

01:21:39.827 --> 01:21:43.160
...and airs this weekend,
so check your local listings.

01:21:43.230 --> 01:21:46.631
Now, the real-life soap opera
that has been  The Sun Also Sets...

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:50.261
will come to a unique climax
as today's live broadcast...

01:21:50.337 --> 01:21:54.171
reveals whether Celeste Talbert,
Lori Craven or Jeffrey Anderson...

01:21:54.241 --> 01:21:55.538
will remain on the show.

01:21:55.609 --> 01:21:59.238
 You mean to say that even the actors
 themselves don't know the outcome?

01:21:59.313 --> 01:22:02.908
That's correct. As they read
their lines off the TelePrompter...

01:22:02.983 --> 01:22:05.474
You've worked with these...
they will learn their fate.

01:22:05.552 --> 01:22:08.453
Given the incredible interest
in the outcome of this broadcast...

01:22:08.522 --> 01:22:13.550
This will be the highest-rated show
in daytime history...

01:22:13.627 --> 01:22:15.857
we figure that our viewers
deserve the utmost spontaneity.

01:22:57.068 --> 01:22:59.332
Hello, David. Sit down.

01:22:59.403 --> 01:23:02.839
We'll play tennis this weekend.
You'll come to my country club.

01:23:02.907 --> 01:23:05.102
You never been there, right?
It's a nice place.

01:23:05.176 --> 01:23:06.905
Great, great.

01:23:19.523 --> 01:23:23.983
And in three, two, one...

01:23:24.061 --> 01:23:25.858
And in.

01:23:30.968 --> 01:23:33.300
Would you be having wine
with your dinner?

01:23:33.371 --> 01:23:37.831
She'll have a Diet Pepsi.

01:23:37.908 --> 01:23:40.035
I'll have a dry sherry.

01:23:43.047 --> 01:23:45.607
- Hold those. I can't wear 'em.
- I think you'll need them.

01:23:45.683 --> 01:23:47.412
- They're ugly!
- You're on.

01:23:47.485 --> 01:23:50.318
Go, go, go!

01:23:50.388 --> 01:23:53.050
Oh, my God.
This guy's as blind as a bat.

01:23:55.359 --> 01:23:59.386
Dr. Randall, what a surprise.
Are you having lunch here?

01:23:59.463 --> 01:24:02.125
Well, I will if it's that simple.

01:24:05.970 --> 01:24:08.404
I wish it was that simple.

01:24:08.472 --> 01:24:10.702
This guy never heard
of contact lenses?

01:24:10.775 --> 01:24:14.006
-  The test results have come back.
-  And?

01:24:14.078 --> 01:24:18.139
And I'm afraid
the results are very disturbing.

01:24:18.916 --> 01:24:23.910
It seems that Angelique
has a rare case...

01:24:24.588 --> 01:24:26.522
of brake fluid.

01:24:29.193 --> 01:24:31.855
- Bran fluid. Bran flavor.
- Brain fever.

01:24:31.929 --> 01:24:33.487
- Brain fever.
- Say it!

01:24:33.564 --> 01:24:35.498
- Brain fever.
- Yes.

01:24:37.234 --> 01:24:41.671
Brain fever.
Or what we call in Austria...

01:24:54.118 --> 01:24:58.111
At the current rate of inflation...

01:24:58.189 --> 01:25:01.852
her brain will
laterally explore the...

01:25:01.926 --> 01:25:04.190
- Literally explode.
- Exactly.

01:25:04.261 --> 01:25:06.957
- Within the next three houses.
- Hours.

01:25:07.898 --> 01:25:11.698
Yes. It will literally explode
within the next three hours.

01:25:11.769 --> 01:25:14.135
I would suggest
leaving the restraint.

01:25:14.205 --> 01:25:16.799
- The restaurant.
- Restaurant.

01:25:16.874 --> 01:25:18.273
Yes.

01:25:19.343 --> 01:25:21.903
Her brain will actually explode?

01:25:24.081 --> 01:25:27.539
Yes. I've seen it happen.

01:25:27.618 --> 01:25:31.281
It's a dreadful...
It's a dreadful, dreadful thug.

01:25:32.289 --> 01:25:34.223
Thing.

01:25:34.291 --> 01:25:36.589
And afterwards...

01:25:38.329 --> 01:25:41.321
I'm sorry, Angelique. I really am.

01:25:41.398 --> 01:25:43.332
I hope it's not too painful.

01:25:44.869 --> 01:25:46.461
She's trying to say something.

01:25:47.738 --> 01:25:50.229
- She is?
- Yes, she is.

01:25:50.307 --> 01:25:53.003
- What's she saying?
- "Can't anything be done?"

01:25:53.077 --> 01:25:55.568
- Can't anything be done?
- Yes. Cold compresses?

01:25:55.646 --> 01:25:58.012
No, I'm sorry.
They don't work with  Kopfgeschlagen.

01:25:58.082 --> 01:25:59.276
Miracle drugs?

01:26:02.219 --> 01:26:05.188
- Nurse Nan!
- I came as soon as I heard the news.

01:26:05.256 --> 01:26:08.157
There's a nurse in the restaurant.
Did I miss a meeting?

01:26:08.225 --> 01:26:10.853
I don't believe this.
I don't believe this.

01:26:10.928 --> 01:26:14.125
What about a brain transplant?

01:26:15.199 --> 01:26:17.429
A brain transplant?

01:26:18.836 --> 01:26:21.361
Yes! A brain transplant!

01:26:22.206 --> 01:26:26.802
But it's far too late
to find a suitable donor.

01:26:26.877 --> 01:26:28.970
I'm the donor. Take my brain.

01:26:29.046 --> 01:26:31.173
I want to do it. She can't die.

01:26:31.248 --> 01:26:35.116
- You both could die.
- That won't happen while I'm here.

01:26:35.186 --> 01:26:37.313
It's impossible.
I haven't any tools.

01:26:37.388 --> 01:26:39.720
- Voila.
- Well done.

01:26:40.758 --> 01:26:43.022
- Dr. Rod?
- Yes?

01:26:43.093 --> 01:26:46.153
I insist that
we proceed immediately.

01:26:46.230 --> 01:26:48.994
- But you need to sign a release.
- I did.

01:26:49.066 --> 01:26:51.034
- You did not! When?
- I did too! Weeks ago.

01:26:51.101 --> 01:26:52.568
- I never saw it.
- On your desk.

01:26:52.636 --> 01:26:55.264
I don't think you realize
how serious this operation is.

01:26:55.339 --> 01:26:59.742
It's very serious. You will not
have a brain when it is complete.

01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:02.643
I don't want my brain. I don't
need it. Take the goddamn thing.

01:27:02.713 --> 01:27:04.203
It's gone.

01:27:04.281 --> 01:27:06.249
All right, everyone!
Clear the restaurant!

01:27:06.317 --> 01:27:08.717
They're ad-libbing, David.
I never heard these words.

01:27:08.786 --> 01:27:10.310
This is not in the script.
Get David.

01:27:10.387 --> 01:27:11.649
- It's busy.
- Try it again.

01:27:11.722 --> 01:27:15.214
Wait, wait. It's not bad.
Let me look.

01:27:15.292 --> 01:27:18.056
This is for the best.

01:27:18.128 --> 01:27:19.322
Follow them.

01:27:19.463 --> 01:27:21.192
Clear the way right away!

01:27:21.265 --> 01:27:25.861
Nurse Nan, up here.
Sterilize the area.

01:27:27.638 --> 01:27:30.072
Where do you want me?

01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:32.267
Trust me.
I've performed this before...

01:27:32.343 --> 01:27:35.073
in worse circumstances than this.

01:27:35.145 --> 01:27:38.080
- Prepare the brain saw.
- At last! Drama!

01:27:41.986 --> 01:27:44.887
There was a time when I would've
performed this with my bare hands.

01:27:44.955 --> 01:27:47.446
- I know it.
- But now...

01:27:47.524 --> 01:27:48.923
What?

01:27:49.994 --> 01:27:53.157
You're really positive about this?

01:27:53.230 --> 01:27:56.427
- It's a lot to give up.
- I want to.

01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.161
It's a relief.

01:27:59.236 --> 01:28:01.227
Very well.

01:28:01.305 --> 01:28:03.239
Prepare the ether.

01:28:04.775 --> 01:28:09.712
Good night, sweet princess.

01:28:34.972 --> 01:28:35.904
Saw.

01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:47.349
Mother! No!
I can't let you do this!

01:28:47.418 --> 01:28:49.283
- She spoke.
- She spoke!

01:28:49.353 --> 01:28:51.344
Sudden speech...
the last stages of brain fever.

01:28:51.422 --> 01:28:54.357
- She could blow at any moment.
- I could always speak.

01:28:54.425 --> 01:28:55.722
- Mother...
- She's my mother.

01:28:55.793 --> 01:28:58.694
- Montana, shut up!
- Now this is a show.

01:28:58.762 --> 01:29:01.560
We gotta stop this right now.

01:29:01.632 --> 01:29:04.916
It's hypnotic.
It's like a truth serum.

01:29:05.050 --> 01:29:08.349
 Celeste, don't leave the show.
 I can't live with that.

01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:10.320
You either, Dad.

01:29:10.388 --> 01:29:11.753
- Dad?
- Dad.

01:29:11.823 --> 01:29:13.688
- Dad.
- Yes.

01:29:13.758 --> 01:29:18.354
- Shortly before I left Vienna, l...
-Jeffrey, give it a rest.

01:29:22.934 --> 01:29:28.065
What are you saying? That you
might want us for real in life?

01:29:28.139 --> 01:29:29.868
- I think so.
- You do?

01:29:29.941 --> 01:29:31.306
Yeah.

01:29:32.377 --> 01:29:34.675
But here's what I don't want.

01:29:34.746 --> 01:29:37.237
I don't want any more lying.

01:29:37.315 --> 01:29:39.613
I don't want any pretending...

01:29:39.684 --> 01:29:42.619
or deception of any kind.

01:29:42.687 --> 01:29:45.281
And I need some time.

01:29:47.259 --> 01:29:50.126
- Can you understand?
- Completely.

01:30:07.045 --> 01:30:09.172
Wait! Wait!

01:30:09.247 --> 01:30:11.807
But I'm carrying his child.

01:30:11.883 --> 01:30:14.283
I didn't sleep with her!

01:30:14.352 --> 01:30:17.048
Will somebody please believe me!

01:30:17.122 --> 01:30:19.215
This is what I meant.

01:30:19.291 --> 01:30:22.988
This is what I told them to do.
This is soap opera.

01:30:23.595 --> 01:30:26.860
- Doctor!
- A second opinion.

01:30:28.133 --> 01:30:33.765
This is Dr. Franz Blau of the sex
change clinic in Bethesda, Maryland.

01:30:33.838 --> 01:30:37.899
Thank you. Dr. Randall,
after extensive investigation...

01:30:37.976 --> 01:30:41.139
I've come to the conclusion
that it's virtually impossible...

01:30:41.212 --> 01:30:45.706
for you to have impregnated
your nurse, Montana Moorehead...

01:30:45.784 --> 01:30:48.753
because before
she came to our little clinic...

01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:50.913
she was...

01:30:50.989 --> 01:30:55.187
Milton Moorehead
of Syosset, Long Island.

01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:56.727
Hello.

01:31:12.677 --> 01:31:14.611
She's a boy.

01:31:17.349 --> 01:31:19.579
Yeah, well, we knew that.

01:31:20.652 --> 01:31:22.142
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:24.381
I'm just gonna go
congratulate the others.

01:31:24.456 --> 01:31:26.447
I'll see ya.

01:31:27.559 --> 01:31:29.049
She's a boy.

01:31:31.529 --> 01:31:35.056
I think I've said it all, don't you?
Bye-bye.

01:31:46.611 --> 01:31:48.545
- Dr. Randall.
- Yes?

01:31:50.582 --> 01:31:54.245
I wish to apologize for
any insinuation I might've made...

01:31:54.319 --> 01:31:56.787
about you and Nurse Nan.

01:31:56.855 --> 01:31:59.016
- I told you.
- Well, I'm apologizing.

01:31:59.090 --> 01:32:00.853
Thank you.

01:32:20.378 --> 01:32:26.112
The best supporting actress in
a daytime drama award goes to...

01:32:28.887 --> 01:32:29.945
Lori Craven.

01:34:07.442 --> 01:34:10.536
If I could just get you right here.
A few words for your fans at home.

01:34:10.612 --> 01:34:13.308
Another big night for you,
David Seton Barnes...

01:34:13.382 --> 01:34:16.715
winner of this year's
Johnny Hockard's Humanitarian Award.

01:34:16.785 --> 01:34:18.980
I know.
I mean, what a magical year.

01:34:19.054 --> 01:34:22.285
It's hard for me to take credit.
The whole thing just snowballed.

01:34:22.357 --> 01:34:25.349
Well, you're certainly the man
of the hour. Congratulations to you.

01:34:25.427 --> 01:34:27.952
It all makes for a storybook ending
to a rather tumultuous year...

01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:30.362
for the cast here
at  The Sun Also Sets...

01:34:30.432 --> 01:34:34.391
a show in which life not only
imitated art, it topped it.
