00:01.078 --> 00:02.914
- She freaks me out.
- Who?

00:02.917 --> 00:04.277
Witch lady.

00:04.288 --> 00:06.848
You want to win so much,
there's a shortcut.

00:06.849 --> 00:08.209
He's slipping!

00:10.056 --> 00:12.903
Dreamtime stories are all about
evil spirits in the bush.

00:12.904 --> 00:14.138
That's superstition.

00:14.139 --> 00:16.449
- Viv...!
- What are you doing in my room?

00:16.450 --> 00:18.462
- Your room?
- Get out, thief!

00:18.622 --> 00:21.233
Everyone who knows us
has forgotten us.

00:21.234 --> 00:24.394
There's an entire village
where all of the men thought their...

00:24.451 --> 00:26.394
Had shrivelled away to nothing.

00:26.471 --> 00:28.311
We really don't exist.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.316
- Of course I remember the carving.
- I knew it.

00:31.317 --> 00:35.362
But I didn't do that with you.
I was with my boyfriend Sammy.

00:36.848 --> 00:38.304
- Open the door!
- What's that?

00:38.305 --> 00:41.540
- There's something out there!
- I think it's some kind of evil spirit!

00:41.541 --> 00:43.653
There's no such thing as ghosts!

01:26.827 --> 01:30.768
Season 1, Episode 4

01:31.081 --> 01:34.081
Synced by Stubbie & Reef
www.addic7ed.com

01:40.346 --> 01:42.881
I can think of a dozen better ways
to fold these.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.800
Don't mess with tradition.
At least not while she's looking.

01:46.834 --> 01:49.766
- Sloppy.
- You'll never impress her.

01:49.767 --> 01:52.167
- I've tried my whole life.
- You wait.

01:54.564 --> 01:56.337
New improved design.

01:59.251 --> 02:02.969
- Really? Come on!
- Do it how I teach you.

02:02.995 --> 02:06.725
- All done, Nai-Nai.
- Oh, Vivien.

02:08.491 --> 02:11.702
Your sister knows how important
Hungry Ghost festival is.

02:11.703 --> 02:13.433
You all look so cute.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.776
- Photo time.
- Photo!

02:16.417 --> 02:18.008
Crazy boy!

02:18.016 --> 02:19.920
- Just be normal.
- Normal?

02:19.931 --> 02:22.422
I'm not the one making dinner
for a bunch of ghosts.

02:22.423 --> 02:25.263
- You have problem with ghosts?
- No problem at all, Nai-Nai.

02:25.274 --> 02:27.034
Just, there's no such thing.

02:28.019 --> 02:31.593
There's no such thing as ghosts!
There's no such thing as ghosts!

02:31.655 --> 02:33.655
There's no such thing as ghosts!

02:33.680 --> 02:35.480
What was that?

02:35.600 --> 02:37.920
A storm like this, could be anything.

02:37.921 --> 02:40.161
- This is no storm!
- What do you mean?

02:40.162 --> 02:42.531
There's something out there.
You saw it.

02:42.532 --> 02:46.088
Well, maybe Andy was right.
Maybe it's just the wind.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.760
This is so messed up!

02:56.989 --> 03:01.839
Never thought I'd say this but
I'm kinda glad you guys are here.

03:01.840 --> 03:05.520
If we do die,
I'm glad we had this.

03:05.521 --> 03:08.426
- Had what?
- An adventure.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.318
I just wanna go home.

03:58.351 --> 04:01.751
I feel like I've been
dragged through a grand final.

04:02.101 --> 04:03.834
You didn't sleep, Sam?

04:03.835 --> 04:06.470
Between your snoring and that storm?
No chance.

04:06.471 --> 04:08.269
It was no storm.

04:08.270 --> 04:11.556
Oh, what do you suggest then, Felix?
Zombie apocalypse?

04:11.557 --> 04:14.997
I think there might be forces
at play which we don't understand.

04:18.284 --> 04:19.764
Andy.

04:20.197 --> 04:21.596
Wait.

04:31.274 --> 04:33.474
Guys, you might want to see this.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.474
This isn't good.

04:55.658 --> 04:57.484
Don't do that!

04:57.577 --> 05:01.474
What's the big deal? Stuff gets
knocked around in a storm.

05:01.475 --> 05:06.259
- Yeah, knocked around. Sure.
- It looks like trails or markings.

05:06.273 --> 05:09.435
- Some kind of large animal.
- What's the biggest thing around here?

05:09.453 --> 05:14.030
- Wombats, wallabies, drunk townies?
- The panther. From the bush.

05:14.034 --> 05:16.166
- That explains the howling.
- Genius.

05:16.167 --> 05:18.548
No, no, I've heard about those,
on the radio.

05:18.549 --> 05:22.296
It must have used the storm as cover
and these must be drag marks.

05:22.297 --> 05:24.471
Like a spirit force or something.

05:24.514 --> 05:27.787
Felix, your brain's been fried
by all that heavy metal.

05:27.788 --> 05:30.239
These are trail bike markings,
obviously.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.914
Not everything in this world
has an easy explanation.

05:32.948 --> 05:34.962
Show me anything,
I'll explain it to you.

05:34.963 --> 05:38.946
- Us, here, now.
- I'm working on that.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.306
- But I'll find an answer.
- I hate this.

05:41.307 --> 05:44.547
My advice is to lay a system
of traps and alerts.

05:44.548 --> 05:48.600
Do whatever you want, Bear Grylls.
I'm gonna find out what this means.

05:48.601 --> 05:51.841
Was that supposed to be an insult?
I love Bear Grylls.

05:52.308 --> 05:53.943
- I'll help.
- Really?

05:53.944 --> 05:57.376
Don't get excited. I need something
to take my mind off how hungry I am.

05:57.377 --> 05:58.726
We've got to find bait.

05:58.727 --> 06:00.796
- By "bait" you mean food?
- Yes.

06:00.797 --> 06:03.083
Anything that panther has,
I'm having too.

06:03.084 --> 06:06.706
Actually, Jake, your digestive
systems are totally different.

06:11.748 --> 06:13.428
- Felix.
- I'll see you later.

06:13.429 --> 06:14.789
Felix!

06:17.028 --> 06:18.588
Not a chance.

06:21.407 --> 06:24.221
Felix, wait up. I'm coming too.

06:25.228 --> 06:29.273
Sinewy meats like pig and boar
are the usual diet of Panthera onca.

06:29.308 --> 06:32.311
- What?
- Pork. The panther will go for pork.

06:32.312 --> 06:34.458
You know a lot of random facts,
don't you?

06:34.459 --> 06:37.748
Excellent fact retention.
I'm in the top .01 percentile.

06:37.957 --> 06:42.612
Anyway, you think I'm bad? You should
hear my dad. He's even better than me.

06:42.778 --> 06:46.648
It's so weird how everything
is exactly like home, but it's not.

06:46.649 --> 06:48.840
It's not just that
we've been forgotten.

06:48.841 --> 06:52.075
There are whole new lives.
Oscar walking.

06:52.076 --> 06:54.328
Sam and Sammy,
and your mum...?

06:54.329 --> 06:56.969
Like a different version
of the same reality.

06:58.277 --> 07:00.597
Oh, you idiot, Andy.
That's it!

07:00.757 --> 07:02.797
- What now?
- Wormholes.

07:02.831 --> 07:05.156
- OK...
- Quantum mechanics!

07:05.157 --> 07:07.691
Matter can slip
between space and time.

07:07.692 --> 07:10.549
It's just that in this case,
we're the matter,

07:10.550 --> 07:13.619
slipping between infinite variations
of the same reality.

07:13.620 --> 07:16.600
- That's the answer.
- Yeah, you lost me at "wormholes".

07:23.397 --> 07:25.597
Why are you in such a hurry?

07:26.921 --> 07:31.137
- You're starting to freak me out, Felix.
- There's something going on here.

07:31.138 --> 07:33.388
And? What are we
gonna do about it?

07:33.919 --> 07:35.224
Follow me.

07:37.671 --> 07:41.471
My family's a well-oiled machine.
8:05 has always been the market run.

07:41.576 --> 07:45.607
- Vivien! Get my purse!
- Yep, same in this reality.

07:45.620 --> 07:46.980
Coming!

07:52.797 --> 07:54.797
Wormhole weirdness.

07:57.962 --> 08:01.362
We've got 25 minutes.
Hope my key still works.

08:09.071 --> 08:12.059
- Give me a hand with this.
- Food first.

08:20.495 --> 08:24.998
I didn't forget your purse!
You never asked me to get it!

08:28.077 --> 08:29.797
Pervert!

08:29.917 --> 08:32.397
Get away from me, you maniac!

08:34.359 --> 08:35.839
You!

08:36.397 --> 08:39.291
See? I told you.
He's stalking me!

08:39.317 --> 08:42.320
- Oh, my God, I am not!
- What you want, crazy boy?

08:42.321 --> 08:45.477
- That's kind of hard to explain.
- Mum, you OK?

08:45.478 --> 08:49.156
- Oh, I feel horrible.
- Mum! Mum! L-let me.

08:49.157 --> 08:51.829
First you break into our house and
now you break into our restaurant.

08:51.830 --> 08:54.291
- You've got some explaining to do.
- It's not what it looks like.

08:54.292 --> 08:55.910
Michael, maybe
we should call the police.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.236
No police!
Stupid girl!

08:57.237 --> 08:59.785
- I'm not stupid and I'm not a girl.
- You don't have to yell.

08:59.786 --> 09:01.686
- I wasn't yelling!
- Respect my son!

09:01.687 --> 09:04.430
- Don't bully my mum, Nai-Nai!
- Don't talk to your grandma like that!

09:04.431 --> 09:06.671
Stop fighting!
What happened to all of you?

09:06.672 --> 09:08.672
You really have no idea
who I am?

09:08.692 --> 09:11.154
You don't feel any connection
to me at all?

09:12.240 --> 09:15.174
No. Why don't you
help us understand?

09:16.597 --> 09:20.347
How familiar are you with
Lorentzian traversable wormholes?

09:22.397 --> 09:24.197
Where are we going?

09:24.629 --> 09:26.309
I hope it's still here.

09:41.858 --> 09:45.841
- We don't have any vampire books.
- I don't want vampire books.

09:46.179 --> 09:47.674
My mistake.

09:57.962 --> 10:01.303
Dude, she was that creepy woman
from the forest.

10:03.053 --> 10:06.040
- Before we got lost, I saw her.
- And what was she doing?

10:06.189 --> 10:08.110
She was watching us.

10:19.944 --> 10:22.624
She keeps all the real magic stuff
hidden away.

10:22.957 --> 10:25.756
Um, you used to have a book
back there.

10:25.757 --> 10:28.502
Tapestry. Hand-bound.
Pretty old.

10:28.908 --> 10:32.056
- How do you know?
- Any chance I could look at it?

10:32.977 --> 10:35.208
No chance.
That's not kids' stuff.

10:35.209 --> 10:39.920
- I know, the sealed section, right?
- Yes, "the sealed section".

10:42.233 --> 10:43.713
- Sam.
- Hmm?

10:44.703 --> 10:47.027
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I need a favour.

10:47.343 --> 10:49.477
<i>By wormhole,
I'm assuming that you mean</i>

10:49.478 --> 10:53.749
<i>a hypothetical feature of space-time
that is basically a shortcut...</i>

11:02.954 --> 11:04.674
"Stick to the path."

11:07.274 --> 11:10.674
"Or suffer what comes."
Hmh! Too late for that.

13:28.216 --> 13:30.674
- Find what you were looking for?
- No.

13:33.994 --> 13:37.265
<i>Of course, Einstein-Rosen
bridges are controversial,</i>

13:37.274 --> 13:40.327
but I think it's the only way to
explain inter-dimensional slippage.

13:40.328 --> 13:43.233
- Your physics makes sense.
- It's proven, in theory.

13:43.234 --> 13:46.074
Large bodies of mass can move
between dimensional planes,

13:46.075 --> 13:47.986
so why not
more than one body?

13:47.987 --> 13:51.775
Firstly, wormholes would never exist long
enough to transfer a large body of mass,

13:51.776 --> 13:54.219
and secondly
why am I even arguing with you?

13:54.220 --> 13:56.213
- What is he on about, Michael?
- Spatial theory.

13:56.214 --> 14:00.573
- He's delusional, Dad.
- I'm not! This is my life. Our life.

14:00.658 --> 14:03.233
- I belong here.
- Maybe you ARE delusional.

14:03.234 --> 14:05.296
You know, there once was
a whole village

14:05.297 --> 14:07.078
who thought that their...
had disappeared.

14:07.079 --> 14:09.569
- You told me that.
- Let's get you to your parents.

14:09.570 --> 14:11.413
- They can decide...
- You ARE my parents!

14:11.414 --> 14:13.576
That's my sister.
My Nai-Nai.

14:13.577 --> 14:17.789
Dad, I know you like to sit in the shed
and do experiments with mass and time.

14:17.841 --> 14:20.055
I know Mum's favourite food
is spaghetti bolognaise,

14:20.056 --> 14:21.879
but she's too frightened
to tell Nai-Nai.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.987
And Nai-Nai, I know you cry
because Dad never knew his father.

14:24.988 --> 14:27.862
And there's lots more I know
because you're my family!

14:27.863 --> 14:29.359
I'm your son!

14:29.385 --> 14:33.618
Ah...! A ghost! The ghost
of the son you never had.

14:33.619 --> 14:35.426
That doesn't even make sense!

14:35.427 --> 14:38.202
- The grandson you never gave me.
- I've had enough.

14:38.203 --> 14:41.643
Mum, enough. Nicole, call the
police. I'm putting a stop to this.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.518
Run! Run! Run!

15:13.191 --> 15:16.291
- Where'd you get that from?
- It was... on the shelf.

15:16.311 --> 15:18.032
- No, it wasn't.
- I just...

15:18.033 --> 15:19.673
- No.
- Can I just...

15:19.674 --> 15:23.963
No. Adults only,
little scoundrel.

15:24.246 --> 15:28.966
Well, then, do you have protective
amulets against evil spirits?

15:28.967 --> 15:33.207
We don't use the 'evil' word
anymore. So judgemental.

15:33.246 --> 15:35.366
What's the cheapest one you've got?

15:37.197 --> 15:38.677
How cheap?

15:43.377 --> 15:45.197
35c?

15:49.124 --> 15:50.482
Great.

15:50.834 --> 15:52.612
Not you again.

15:53.475 --> 15:56.396
Hey, ah, just wait!

15:56.824 --> 15:58.304
Wait.

16:00.905 --> 16:04.225
I'm sorry about acting all nutso
crazy pants the other day.

16:05.517 --> 16:06.997
That's not me.

16:06.998 --> 16:10.141
Sorry, but all evidence
points to the contrary.

16:10.142 --> 16:12.671
I just wanna speak to her
for a sec. Is that OK?

16:12.672 --> 16:17.066
And I just wanna marry Robert Pattinson.
But you know that's as likely to happen.

16:17.946 --> 16:19.812
No, it's OK.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.218
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

16:25.305 --> 16:26.785
It's just...

16:28.585 --> 16:32.058
You and I, I feel like...

16:33.734 --> 16:36.414
I feel like we might have things
in common.

16:47.105 --> 16:48.974
Forget it.

16:50.830 --> 16:54.194
Come on. We have, like,
human beings to meet.

17:02.523 --> 17:06.002
I was going to throw these out,
but you can have them.

17:09.871 --> 17:13.159
Since when do protective charms
have use-by dates?

17:13.280 --> 17:16.319
- Since they came from Korea.
- Will they work?

17:16.440 --> 17:20.448
You tell me. Felix.

17:22.423 --> 17:24.394
How did you
know my name?

17:25.757 --> 17:28.292
- It's on your book.
- Oh.

17:31.608 --> 17:33.834
- Are we done here?
- One minute.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.605
The amulet picks you.

17:39.807 --> 17:42.611
Thank you. Phoebe.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.728
Wait, how did you know my name?

18:11.351 --> 18:13.295
So what's the plan now?

18:15.298 --> 18:18.794
- We still don't have any bait.
- We don't need bait.

18:21.074 --> 18:24.839
So the panther's going to be lured
by tin cans, then.

18:25.008 --> 18:27.088
It's an early alarm system.

18:28.767 --> 18:31.728
So we're gonna put strings
around the entire forest?

18:33.354 --> 18:34.834
If I have to.

18:36.068 --> 18:39.021
Even if this thing works,
how do we know it's a panther

18:39.022 --> 18:42.019
and not just a possum,
or something?

18:44.320 --> 18:47.120
- Got you there, nerd.
- You know what?

18:47.193 --> 18:49.233
Why don't you come up
with an answer?

18:49.234 --> 18:52.689
Why don't you try to work things out
for once? I'm sick of it!

18:52.690 --> 18:55.275
- Andy, I didn't mean to...
- Yes, you did!

18:55.520 --> 18:58.176
Hey, Andy, stop. Please.

19:00.951 --> 19:04.524
I was just being a pain.
I didn't mean to...

19:05.585 --> 19:07.353
I don't know.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.477
I'm sorry, alright?

19:10.905 --> 19:12.385
Alright.

19:12.716 --> 19:16.497
Hey... last one.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.403
Thanks.

19:24.271 --> 19:25.751
What's it say?

19:25.871 --> 19:28.716
"Rise above any random insults."

19:28.898 --> 19:30.378
Really?

19:36.200 --> 19:38.854
Shall we keep going?
I'll help.

19:39.207 --> 19:43.447
I think we should do something
a bit more useful. Come on.

19:52.934 --> 19:56.817
They used to be so happy.
They used to like each other.

19:56.990 --> 19:59.627
- This reality's horrible.
- For me it's the opposite.

19:59.628 --> 20:03.652
- I've never seen my mum so happy.
- My own family called the police on me.

20:05.871 --> 20:09.164
Are you going to give us a hand?
These beds are for all of us.

20:09.165 --> 20:11.311
So what do we do
if we catch a panther?

20:11.744 --> 20:14.822
- Feed it Felix?
- What's he doing now?

20:15.690 --> 20:17.630
Jazz...? Ballet?

20:20.983 --> 20:23.924
- This is heaps comfy.
- Oh, thanks, Sam.

20:23.925 --> 20:26.485
Hey, I'm helping out.
I'm just testing it, OK?

20:27.105 --> 20:28.705
Oh, I'm starving.

20:30.551 --> 20:32.031
Come on.

20:35.549 --> 20:36.949
Your granny was right.

20:37.391 --> 20:40.791
We ARE like ghosts,
haunting our own home town.

20:40.818 --> 20:43.543
Ghosts of boys
trapped in the wrong reality.

20:45.151 --> 20:47.688
- Occam's Razor.
- What now?

20:47.962 --> 20:50.802
The simplest explanation
is the most likely.

20:50.803 --> 20:54.387
What if we didn't go through a wormhole?
What if we're unconscious?

20:54.388 --> 20:56.791
- Lucid dreaming!
- Enough with the theories.

20:56.792 --> 20:59.208
Where were we before
everything went haywire?

20:59.396 --> 21:02.642
- In the forest...
- We might still be there right now.

21:02.654 --> 21:04.694
- Unconscious.
- What?

21:04.695 --> 21:07.785
Don't you think it's weird
that when we fell, no-one was hurt?

21:07.786 --> 21:09.762
This is all a fantasy.

21:09.763 --> 21:13.283
A final attempt by our neural
transmitters to cling on to life.

21:13.434 --> 21:16.274
We have to wake ourselves
or we'll starve to death.

21:16.434 --> 21:20.106
- You're an idiot.
- I'm an idiot? Watch this!

21:28.357 --> 21:30.157
That's some pretty conclusive
evidence.

21:30.158 --> 21:33.158
Go easy on him.
He's had a hard day.

21:37.299 --> 21:40.079
It has to be something
that will really shock us.

21:41.052 --> 21:43.481
I think we'd better follow him.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.474
Where are you going, you nutjob?

21:50.634 --> 21:53.991
Something high. Or fast.
A train, that'll do it.

21:53.992 --> 21:56.472
But the train hasn't run in years!

21:57.758 --> 21:59.878
But the school bus runs every day.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.300
Oh, no.

22:15.154 --> 22:18.332
Catch a train, huh?
Come on, losers!

22:42.474 --> 22:46.216
Come on, Andy. You can do it.
No fear.

22:57.994 --> 23:00.255
- Get off him, Trent!
- That's it, Mike!

23:02.106 --> 23:04.186
Trent, I said get off him!

23:08.674 --> 23:11.300
Right, that's it, Trent.
You're in trouble!

23:15.954 --> 23:17.834
Hey, watch out!

23:19.095 --> 23:20.575
Look out!

23:32.992 --> 23:34.993
- Are you alright?
- What happened?

23:34.994 --> 23:36.535
Are you hurt?

23:37.194 --> 23:39.103
You just saved my life.

23:40.173 --> 23:43.493
- What the hell were you doing, son?
- You almost hit her.

23:43.494 --> 23:44.854
Come on.

23:47.837 --> 23:50.083
- Bye.
- Bye...

23:52.732 --> 23:54.332
Sweetheart, are you alright?

23:57.074 --> 23:59.703
Who are those boys...?

24:01.955 --> 24:03.709
Hey! Oscar!

24:03.710 --> 24:06.010
Before you appeared,
I was number four

24:06.011 --> 24:09.294
on Trent's and Dylan's bully list
and now I'm at two.

24:09.295 --> 24:12.735
You were with the guy from the bus.
He saved my life.

24:12.736 --> 24:15.296
Are you Andy?
My mission was to deliver this.

24:15.345 --> 24:16.755
I've never been admired before.

24:16.865 --> 24:19.526
Hello, Bremin.
Prepare to fall in love with me.

24:19.623 --> 24:20.825
It was him.

24:20.826 --> 24:22.880
Break and enter
at Bremin High last weekend.

24:22.945 --> 24:24.585
- You know anything about that?
- No.

24:24.596 --> 24:28.092
If you make that, you can keep
the board you stole off me.

24:28.492 --> 24:32.456
- Things like this keep happening.
- Oscar, we have to go inside.

24:32.557 --> 24:35.486
Elemental attacks.
This is very special.

24:37.932 --> 24:39.263
What's he doing here?

24:39.264 --> 24:42.074
I know that you're aliens and
there's a swarm of killer alien bees

24:42.075 --> 24:43.435
right outside that door.
