01:08.800 --> 01:11.360
You've got to think of him the way he was.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.440
He cycled around Dublin...

01:13.520 --> 01:16.560
in his pin-striped suit with
Â£10,000 on his head.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.880
"Why hide, Joe", he'd say...

01:19.040 --> 01:21.040
"...when that's what they expect?"

01:21.360 --> 01:23.640
But he never did what anyone expected.

01:23.840 --> 01:27.000
He got the British out of here,
and no one expected that.

01:29.040 --> 01:32.000
Some people are what the times demand...

01:32.160 --> 01:34.600
and life without them seems impossible.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.400
But he's dead.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.720
And life is possible.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.560
He made it possible.

02:04.240 --> 02:05.680
Fire!

02:43.360 --> 02:45.040
Cease firing!

02:45.200 --> 02:46.960
Cease firing!

02:49.520 --> 02:50.960
Move forward!

02:52.720 --> 02:54.000
Come forward!

02:58.880 --> 03:02.880
Keep your hands in the air and your
weapons visible at all times.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.600
Form up, in three columns...

03:05.920 --> 03:07.440
across the square.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.000
Now, ground your arms.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.920
Take three paces back...

03:12.080 --> 03:13.280
slowly.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.640
Move three paces back, now!

03:20.240 --> 03:22.960
The game's over, Harry. We lost again.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.240
Quick...march!

03:39.200 --> 03:40.600
Pick your feet up!

03:42.160 --> 03:44.080
Move it, you Fenian bastard!

03:56.960 --> 03:58.560
Open the gates!

04:08.560 --> 04:11.120
Show me the ringleaders
of this little farce.

04:16.320 --> 04:17.680
Pearse...

04:18.399 --> 04:20.000
with the gunner eye.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.360
McDonagh.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.880
Thomas Clarke.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.200
Connolly.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.000
Get up, you Fenian swine.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.400
Wait, Michael. Wait.

04:40.560 --> 04:41.600
Till when?

04:41.760 --> 04:43.320
Till the next time.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.320
Eamon de Valera.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.360
What happens next time?

05:05.520 --> 05:08.800
We won't play by their rules.
We'll invent our own.

05:08.960 --> 05:09.920
Fire!

05:13.520 --> 05:14.960
"The fact...

05:16.320 --> 05:18.240
"that I was born in...

05:19.760 --> 05:21.200
"America...

05:23.040 --> 05:25.520
"might save my hide.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.680
"Either way...

05:30.560 --> 05:32.080
"I am ready...

05:32.720 --> 05:34.000
"for what...

05:34.400 --> 05:35.760
"comes.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.280
"The Irish Republic...

05:41.200 --> 05:42.800
"is a dream...

05:43.120 --> 05:44.320
"no longer".

05:44.400 --> 05:45.360
Fire!

05:48.480 --> 05:50.400
"lt is daily sealed...

05:52.480 --> 05:54.640
"by the lifeblood...

05:55.360 --> 05:57.280
"of those who...

05:58.160 --> 06:00.000
"proclaimed it.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.600
"And every one of us...

06:10.960 --> 06:12.320
"they shoot...

06:14.000 --> 06:16.480
"brings more people...

06:17.920 --> 06:19.760
"to our side.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.560
"They cannot imprison us...

06:24.880 --> 06:26.160
"forever.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.640
"And from...

06:29.040 --> 06:30.240

06:30.560 --> 06:32.240
"of our release...

06:33.280 --> 06:34.480
"Michael...

06:35.840 --> 06:37.440
"we must act...

06:38.160 --> 06:40.080
"as if the Republic...

06:40.400 --> 06:41.360
"is...

06:41.520 --> 06:43.040
"a fact.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.440
"We defeat...

06:46.960 --> 06:48.560
"the British Empire...

06:50.160 --> 06:51.440
"by...

06:53.120 --> 06:54.400
"ignoring it".

07:18.320 --> 07:22.080
They let us out of jail so we can
do our best to be put inside again.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.160
Don't you see a certain paradox in that?

07:30.520 --> 07:32.000
Paradox.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.680
A contradiction.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.360
An immovable force meets an
immovable object kind of thing.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.960
Look, isn't that a lovely picture?

08:12.600 --> 08:14.440
Maybe we should settle down.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.120
Just the two of us?

08:16.280 --> 08:17.320
And him.

08:18.440 --> 08:19.400
Who?

08:25.160 --> 08:26.360
How are you?

08:26.520 --> 08:28.360
How long has that man been there?

08:28.440 --> 08:31.080
As long as we have. Half an hour or so.

08:33.159 --> 08:34.600
How'd they know we were coming?

08:34.679 --> 08:36.280
They know what we ate for breakfast.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.760
There's only one way to beat them, then.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.080
Find out what they eat for breakfast.

08:47.000 --> 08:47.880
Fuck.

08:48.040 --> 08:49.480
It's market day.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.040
Where are you going?

08:58.920 --> 09:01.000
So, what did you have for breakfast?

09:01.080 --> 09:03.960
A traffic jam, lads.
If you backed up, we could back up...

09:04.040 --> 09:05.880
and you could chase us some more.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.680
If we sit here a minute, it'll sort itself out.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.200
Grand so.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.800
The fact that the candidate
you're being asked to vote for...

09:27.880 --> 09:31.800
is at this moment rotting in an
English jail shouldn't put you off!

09:32.040 --> 09:34.760
I was in one myself till a week ago!

09:35.960 --> 09:37.480
They can jail us.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.000
They can shoot us.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.960
They can even conscript us!

09:42.760 --> 09:46.200
They can use us as cannon
fodder in the Somme!

09:47.720 --> 09:48.840
But...

09:49.000 --> 09:51.320
we have a weapon more powerful...

09:51.480 --> 09:54.920
than any in the whole
arsenal of the British Empire!

09:55.080 --> 09:56.280
That weapon...

09:56.360 --> 09:58.280
is our refusal!

09:59.080 --> 10:02.520
Our refusal to bow to
any order but our own!

10:03.240 --> 10:05.640
Any institution but our own!

10:08.760 --> 10:12.520
Our friends in the Royal Irish
Constabulary want to shut me up.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.000
Jail me again, shoot me, who knows?

10:17.720 --> 10:20.280
But I'd like you to send them a message!

10:20.600 --> 10:23.560
If they shut me up,
who'll take my place?

10:25.240 --> 10:26.680
Who'll take my place?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.280
We will!

10:28.520 --> 10:31.240
I can't hear you! Who'll take my place?

10:31.640 --> 10:33.640
Will they shut you up?

10:42.520 --> 10:43.560
Clear a path!

10:43.640 --> 10:44.920
Clear a path!

10:45.080 --> 10:47.440
Get him out! Go, get him out!

10:59.720 --> 11:01.560
So, what's your name?

11:01.720 --> 11:02.680
Kitty.

11:03.560 --> 11:04.840
Is Harry here?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.600
Downstairs.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.800
What did they hit you with?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.960
Whatever it was, it was hard.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.520
- You'll be all right.
- You're a nurse, Kitty?

11:18.600 --> 11:19.720
I'm nothing.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.040
I'm my father's daughter.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.240
Who's your father?

11:23.320 --> 11:24.440
He's dead.

11:26.200 --> 11:29.000
There's dinner in an hour,
if you fancy it.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.440
Grand so.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.840
"Last night she came to me

11:35.480 --> 11:38.120
"She came softly in

11:39.960 --> 11:42.600
"Was so softly she came that

11:44.040 --> 11:46.600
"Her feet made no din

11:48.280 --> 11:51.000
"And she laid her hand on me

11:52.200 --> 11:54.760
"And this she did say

11:56.280 --> 11:59.520
"'Aye, it will not be long, love

12:01.240 --> 12:02.760
"'Till our

12:02.920 --> 12:04.840
"'Wedding day"'

12:07.080 --> 12:09.160
Gorgeous, Kitty. Beautiful.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.400
Mick's about to make another speech.

12:13.480 --> 12:16.360
What are you saying, you Dublin jackeen?

12:16.520 --> 12:17.800
What would you know about singing?

12:17.880 --> 12:20.600
I agree, you West Cork muck savage.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.360
You're the expert in singing.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.520
So it's your turn now, right?

12:23.600 --> 12:25.560
Hey, hey, give over, Harry, will ya.

12:25.640 --> 12:28.200
She has a voice like an angel.
I have one like a puck goat.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.200
Is it or is it not Mick's turn?

12:30.280 --> 12:31.400
No, please.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.720
A noble call is mine...

12:33.880 --> 12:36.360
and I call on Michael.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.920
Mick, give us your party piece.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.320
Come on, Mick. Give us a song.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.160
He hasn't a note in his head.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.200
Shut up.

12:47.160 --> 12:50.600
"Well do I remember
the bleak December day

12:50.760 --> 12:53.760
"The landlord and the sheriff
came to drive us all away

12:54.280 --> 12:57.960
"They set my roof on fire with
their cursed foreign spleen

12:58.280 --> 13:00.840
"And that's another reason

13:01.000 --> 13:04.040
"Why I left old Skibereen"

13:05.080 --> 13:06.720
Twelve more verses, now.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.840
You wanted to be woken.

13:29.160 --> 13:33.400
There was a man in West Cork
who proposed to five sisters...

13:34.360 --> 13:35.960
one after the other.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.440
I suppose they all refused.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.560
Then the father died,
and he proposed to the mother.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.160
Are you trying to tell me something?

13:45.480 --> 13:48.120
I was building up to a proposal.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.760
It's not easy with a Fenian in your bed.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.360
- He likes you too.
- I do?

13:54.520 --> 13:55.480
Stop it.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.640
- But, sadly, he snores.
- I do not.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.400
So it's up to you, Kitty.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.480
- I don't have to like either.
- Never was a truer word spoken.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.640
And he sleeps in his trousers.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.400
Forgive the brute.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.160
Morning.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.240
Morning.

14:12.520 --> 14:13.800
Behave yourself.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.240
Am I dreaming?

14:15.400 --> 14:16.680
I think you are.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.560
We'll be an invisible army.

14:21.640 --> 14:25.080
Our uniform will be that of the man
on the street, the peasant in the field.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.360
We'll strike the enemy
and vanish back in the crowd again.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.040
What do we strike with?

14:30.120 --> 14:31.520
What have you got?

14:34.760 --> 14:35.720
Show me.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.720
Jeez, look at this, Harry.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.280
Same old story.
You need something better.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.880
Where's the police barracks?

14:41.960 --> 14:44.680
- Two miles down the road.
- There is an arsenal.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.840
How do we get in? We have no bullets!

14:46.920 --> 14:48.440
They don't know that.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.040
What's that?

14:52.200 --> 14:54.680
- A sod of turf.
- Wrong. That's a weapon.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.280
Fucking deadly.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.880
You don't believe me?

15:04.280 --> 15:05.720
What is it now?

15:30.280 --> 15:31.720
Good evening, lads.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.480
Hands in the air.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.200
- Drop your weapons!
- Now!

15:38.840 --> 15:41.640
We'll relieve you of your responsibilities.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.400
Grab that bag, one of youse.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.360
Jesus, lads, it's Christmas.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.640
You'll be organized in flying columns.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.240
Fight on your own terms.
What's your name?

16:02.440 --> 16:03.880
- Whose terms, Pat?
- Ours.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.280
I want each of those to capture ten more.

16:06.360 --> 16:09.400
And I want you to account for every bullet,
understand?

16:09.640 --> 16:10.760
Stand up!

16:12.360 --> 16:14.200
- You understand?
- Yes, sir!

16:14.440 --> 16:17.920
I'll make a fucking army out of you
if it's the last thing I do.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.520
- Am I late, Joe?
- Not yet.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.680
Can't keep the gob-shites waiting.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.040
Harry, I want something...

16:42.120 --> 16:44.320
Hold on, hold on. Behind you.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.040
Jesus wept.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.160
Five minutes.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.680
Sit down.

17:01.960 --> 17:03.200
Have a drink.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.280
What's this?

17:13.440 --> 17:14.720
What's all this?

17:15.400 --> 17:17.359
You've been on my heels for weeks.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.079
Very eager for a G man.

17:20.359 --> 17:22.079
I've something for you.

17:22.599 --> 17:23.760
Don't!

17:23.880 --> 17:25.920
Don't you ever calm down?

17:28.800 --> 17:31.000
Names and addresses
of the whole cabinet.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.960
They're to be lifted tonight.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.120
It's an illegal gathering...

17:37.200 --> 17:39.880
in open defiance
of His Majesty's government.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.280
How'd you get this?

17:47.880 --> 17:50.720
Like you said, I'm eager, for a G man.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.280
Why should I trust you?

17:54.480 --> 17:56.640
Logically, I suppose you shouldn't.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.840
But I've been on your heels for weeks...

18:00.040 --> 18:02.280
making notes of your speeches.

18:03.520 --> 18:06.240
Let's just say that you can be persuasive.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.520
You work for the Castle.

18:11.680 --> 18:12.840
I know.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.400
What was it you said...

18:15.880 --> 18:18.240
"Our only weapon is our refusal".

18:30.880 --> 18:33.280
I am getting very tired of the spectacle...

18:33.360 --> 18:36.720
of an upstart dominating
these entire cabinet proceedings.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.960
I've said it before and I'll say it again:

18:39.040 --> 18:42.000
The minister is, as usual,
exceeding his brief.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.640
And just what is my brief?

18:43.720 --> 18:45.120
Intelligence.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.320
Bullshit.

18:46.440 --> 18:49.880
I'm minister for gunrunning,
daylight robbery and general mayhem.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.640
Until we're armed,
nothing's going to happen.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.000
But as minister of intelligence,
I'd like to inform you...

18:56.160 --> 18:58.440
that each of us is to be arrested...

18:58.600 --> 18:59.680
tonight.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.320
How does the minister know this?

19:03.400 --> 19:05.800
Now, Cathal, don't exceed your brief.

19:07.200 --> 19:11.280
Names, addresses, next of kin,
of the whole cabinet.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.600
They know more about us
than our mothers do.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.280
How do we know it's genuine?

19:18.960 --> 19:21.280
We don't, chief. But it could well be.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.680
So, nobody sleeps at home tonight.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.280
I disagree.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.680
Do sleep at home tonight.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.160
If Mr. Collins has been gulled,
we'll sleep soundly.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.680
If not, they will arrest the cabinet.

19:40.840 --> 19:44.240
The public outcry will be deafening.
Maybe then the world will listen.

19:44.320 --> 19:48.160
You can't be serious. We've been
rotting in English jails long enough!

19:48.520 --> 19:50.160
I... am...

19:50.280 --> 19:51.720
serious, Michael.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.600
Fuck them.

19:58.440 --> 20:01.200
- Mind your tongue.
- I fucking will in future.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.880
Mother of God.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.440
Pull in.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.560
Christ, the G man was right.

20:12.720 --> 20:13.680
Come on.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.760
This is an illegal arrest...

20:35.880 --> 20:38.560
by an illegal force of occupation!

20:42.240 --> 20:43.440
Jesus Christ.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.200
It's the safest house in Dublin now.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.040
May as well stay the night.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.960
What does the minister think?

21:01.480 --> 21:02.880
Which minister?

21:04.080 --> 21:05.800
We're the only two left.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.400
I'm changing your brief.

21:08.880 --> 21:12.000
I hereby appoint you
minister for general mayhem.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.120
What's your brief?

21:15.200 --> 21:16.240
The same.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.240
Plus one other portfolio.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.040
Jailbreaks.

21:41.520 --> 21:44.360
How are youse?
Didn't I tell you he snores?

21:46.120 --> 21:47.200
How are you?

21:47.280 --> 21:49.280
Do you remember Kitty?

21:49.920 --> 21:52.000
Indeed I do. Do you remember me?

21:52.160 --> 21:53.520
Vaguely.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.360
All right...

21:57.480 --> 21:59.400
l know when I'm not wanted.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.440
See you.

22:18.280 --> 22:20.440
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Boland.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.720
I'll wrestle you for her.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.600
Go away.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.960
She's not interested in a bogman like you.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.520
Want to bet?

22:44.680 --> 22:46.320
Come here, Boland!

22:55.680 --> 22:57.120
Leave me alone!

23:01.120 --> 23:02.760
Give us a hand, will you?

23:02.920 --> 23:04.320
Give me an ear!

23:08.200 --> 23:09.960
Fuck off and leave me alone!

23:20.360 --> 23:22.600
What's your game, Mr. Broy?

23:22.880 --> 23:25.040
- Don't have a game.
- Why did you give me that list?

23:25.120 --> 23:26.800
Why didn't you act on it?

23:27.600 --> 23:29.920
The cabinet thinks it's useful in jail.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.840
You obviously don't agree.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.120
Look...

23:33.280 --> 23:37.680
Castle informers have run
us through like woodworm.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.080
You could play the same game.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.280
You're a queer bloody G man.

23:43.440 --> 23:44.600
You don't believe me, do you?

23:44.680 --> 23:45.840
I'm not sure.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.680
What would convince you?

23:52.680 --> 23:54.400
Show me the Castle files.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.600
I'd never get them out.

23:56.680 --> 23:57.760
No...

23:59.080 --> 24:00.840
but you could get me in.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.680
Jesus, you're serious?

24:04.840 --> 24:06.200
Think I'm joking?

24:06.280 --> 24:08.280
Does anybody know what I look like?

24:08.360 --> 24:09.360
Only me.

24:09.480 --> 24:12.320
Pretend I'm an informer.
Let me in at midnight.

24:12.480 --> 24:13.520
We'd never get away with it.

24:13.600 --> 24:17.600
Everything's possible if you wish
hard enough. Who said that?

24:17.760 --> 24:18.960
You did.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.120
'Twas him.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.440
Peter Pan.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.560
How is it?

24:52.200 --> 24:54.280
- Grand evening.
- Yeah, not bad.

24:54.480 --> 24:55.680
Is Broy here?

24:55.840 --> 24:57.360
- Who?
- Detective Ned Broy.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.840
Told me to drop by if I had information.

25:00.640 --> 25:01.760
How are you?

25:07.080 --> 25:08.480
Inspector Broy?

25:09.280 --> 25:10.560
Down there.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.360
- Who is it?
- Grace, sir, John Grace.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.480
Come in, Mr. Grace.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.600
I've information relating to
the guttersnipe called Collins.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.840
- You're not nervous?
- I'm shaking.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Don't.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.720
Use this.

25:46.880 --> 25:47.840
Sorry.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.680
Index to the files.

25:52.320 --> 25:55.560
Files on the IRB in England,
Scotland, America.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.120
Irish Volunteers.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.200
Sinn Fein, more Sinn Fein.

25:59.360 --> 26:00.720
More IRB.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.840
I have to lock you in.
If you hear anyone, be quiet.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.840
If caught, you're on your own.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.280
Don't I know it.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.480
Jesus wept.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.320
Christ, that's all we need.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.000
Get up, you! Get up!

27:13.200 --> 27:15.360
- Get up!
- He was celebrating, Tom!

27:16.000 --> 27:17.360
The birth of his child.

27:17.440 --> 27:20.480
Was he, now?
And what was it, boy or girl?

27:20.640 --> 27:21.520
Girl.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.200
Have a drink.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.600
All work and no play.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.720
Are you finished in here?

28:02.440 --> 28:05.320
It's a drink, is it? Shame to waste it.

28:05.520 --> 28:06.760
Take it.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.480
Let's get you cleaned up
and take you home.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.920
- Where's me breakfast?
- Time to go, Mick.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.200
Wait a minute.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.680
Mick, you're pushing it.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.520
Can you get a typist?

28:42.600 --> 28:43.560
Why?

28:43.720 --> 28:45.840
Copy every new file and send it to me.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.160
I'll try. Now, you've got to leave.

28:48.320 --> 28:50.720
You could squash us in a week, you know.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.880
Why do you think I came to you?

28:53.120 --> 28:55.040
If we don't get there first...

28:55.360 --> 28:57.120
things might get rough.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.320
How rough?

28:58.400 --> 28:59.520
Very rough.

29:00.480 --> 29:03.440
These files are no good without
the G men who compiled them.

29:03.520 --> 29:04.680
That's rough.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.000
Can you handle it?

29:07.560 --> 29:10.800
After tonight, I can handle anything.
Come on.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.040
Where the hell have you been?

29:23.200 --> 29:24.240
Working.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.280
Where?

29:25.800 --> 29:29.640
I want a file made on every member
of the British administration.

29:30.280 --> 29:34.920
Look through whatever you can find:
"Who's Who", society columns.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.920
I want names, addresses, clubs...

29:39.120 --> 29:41.920
where they bank,
what they eat for breakfast.

29:42.760 --> 29:45.280
Keep it up to date. Add to it weekly.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.600
Tom...

29:47.280 --> 29:50.640
get me a list of our 12 best men.
Young, no families.

29:50.760 --> 29:53.160
- What for?
- The 12 Apostles. Just do it!

29:53.640 --> 29:55.560
Joe, take a letter.

29:55.720 --> 29:57.280
Where have you been?

29:57.440 --> 29:59.520
"To Whom It May Concern:

29:59.680 --> 30:02.560
"This is to inform you
that any further collaboration...

30:02.640 --> 30:06.040
"with the forces of occupation
will be punishable by death.

30:07.560 --> 30:09.120
"You have been warned.

30:09.440 --> 30:12.200
"Signed, the Irish Republican Army".

30:14.240 --> 30:15.680
Are you serious?

30:17.320 --> 30:18.600
Afraid so.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.280
Send one to every G man.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.680
I saw their files. They know too much.

30:23.760 --> 30:24.720
Look.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.360
Look. That's us.

30:29.440 --> 30:32.520
- Where'd you get these?
- Know how they thrive?

30:32.680 --> 30:34.120
Informers.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.720
Without them,
the Brits would have no system.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.680
Now, imagine the Castle...

30:40.840 --> 30:44.000
where anyone who collaborated
knew he'd be shot.

30:44.160 --> 30:47.280
They wouldn't be able to move
outside those fucking walls.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.000
That's how serious I am.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.600
There's only one problem.

30:51.720 --> 30:52.800
What?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.440
We'd have to do it.

30:57.760 --> 30:58.800
Yes.

31:03.840 --> 31:04.800
So...

31:07.680 --> 31:09.200
could you bear it?

31:23.080 --> 31:24.400
You got one too?

31:24.520 --> 31:25.760
It's a joke.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.160
No Fenian guttersnipe threatens me.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.760
Give us a name.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.120
What for?

31:32.240 --> 31:34.800
Someone to hang and fry like bacon!

31:43.240 --> 31:44.480
Here's one.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.080
Cullen.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.880
Don't threaten us, you Fenian swine.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.720
We threaten you!

32:27.200 --> 32:28.560
What's this mean?

32:30.760 --> 32:33.040
It means you can get out now.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.120
What?

32:34.320 --> 32:36.000
Give up our jobs?

32:36.120 --> 32:38.880
And miss out on all the fun?

32:39.680 --> 32:41.680
Or face the music, Hoey.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.560
You're the only one
who will make music here.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.040
God's curse on them!

32:56.640 --> 32:58.000
Go on!

33:01.840 --> 33:03.200
Who's John Grace?

33:07.600 --> 33:08.480
Ned?

33:12.240 --> 33:13.520
They dumped him.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.040
Tommy.

33:29.600 --> 33:30.560
Hoey.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.280
I know. Come on.

33:42.400 --> 33:45.760
Any of ye who read Irish history
know movements like ours...

33:45.960 --> 33:49.120
are always destroyed
by paid spies and informers.

33:49.880 --> 33:52.960
I want to set up an outfit
that'll rectify that.

33:53.240 --> 33:57.880
Your job will be to wreck the system of
information the Castle uses against us.

33:58.040 --> 34:00.760
To make it unhealthy for them to run it.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.480
How unhealthy?

34:03.320 --> 34:05.440
We've sent letters of warning...

34:05.640 --> 34:07.360
to every G man.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.679
If they're stupid enough
to stay in the Castle...

34:11.120 --> 34:12.760
then they'll be shot.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.080
And you will have to do the shooting.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.520
Don't expect it to be pleasant.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.639
Any of ye with any qualms,
there's the door.

34:26.840 --> 34:29.159
Would we have got past the door?

34:31.159 --> 34:32.719
You would have, Vinny.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.880
Seriously though,
I won't force this on any man.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.240
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.680
I want to thank you.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.600
For what, Father?

35:46.760 --> 35:48.200
For these mornings...

35:48.280 --> 35:49.880
praying together.

35:52.360 --> 35:55.680
I can't pretend to understand your politics.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.960
But I can appreciate...

35:58.120 --> 35:59.800
your integrity.

36:00.480 --> 36:02.400
And I yours, Father.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.600
And if prayer...

36:06.840 --> 36:09.080
can transcend these things...

36:09.960 --> 36:11.720
there's hope, surely.

36:12.160 --> 36:13.640
There must be.

36:20.800 --> 36:21.680
Raid!

36:21.760 --> 36:23.520
Out! Everybody out!

36:23.880 --> 36:25.440
Move! Get out!

37:05.080 --> 37:07.560
Ma'am, how do I get out of here?

37:07.680 --> 37:08.720
Grand.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.800
Give me The Mail.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.160
That's for the job on Friday.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.520
Get them! Get those two men!

37:35.680 --> 37:36.920
Stop them!

37:43.280 --> 37:45.040
These are the best premises
you could get?

37:45.120 --> 37:47.480
A temporary stopgap, I swear.

37:53.080 --> 37:55.240
What'll be next, the knackers' yard?

37:56.520 --> 37:57.960
Made the front page.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.440
What does it say?

37:59.520 --> 38:01.960
"Dublin Detective Riddled With Bullets".

38:02.360 --> 38:04.200
"Riddled"? Riddled?

38:04.760 --> 38:06.520
Why are you riddling people?

38:06.600 --> 38:08.240
Ten bullets, when the one would do?

38:08.320 --> 38:09.800
To make sure he died.

38:09.880 --> 38:12.960
Lads, try and remember
they don't grow on trees.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.520
- What don't they grow on?
- Trees.

38:14.600 --> 38:15.720
Get out.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.480
- From the chief.
- When?

38:19.640 --> 38:20.840
This morning.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.280
Boys, you did well.
But go easy on the riddling.

38:24.920 --> 38:25.960
Go on.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.080
Sure it's from Dev?

38:31.880 --> 38:33.720
Christ, pure genius.

38:33.880 --> 38:34.840
Look.

38:42.280 --> 38:46.560
Yeah, I want peace and quiet.
I want it so much I'd die for it.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.120
You mean you'd kill for it first.

38:50.200 --> 38:52.120
No, not first. Last.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.680
You know you are good at it.

38:54.760 --> 38:55.800
At what?

38:55.960 --> 38:57.160
Bloody mayhem.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.120
You're not so bad yourself.

38:59.560 --> 39:02.000
But Mick, you're more than good.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.400
You leave them sitting
in the halfpenny place.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.320
We haven't seen anything yet.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.760
Are you saying things will get worse?

39:14.200 --> 39:15.960
So we'll have to get worse?

39:16.040 --> 39:16.840
Yep.

39:18.600 --> 39:19.960
Know what?

39:20.440 --> 39:21.560
I hate them.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.280
Not for their race or their brutality.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.960
I hate them for leaving us no way out.

39:27.720 --> 39:30.280
I hate whoever put a gun in Vinny's hand.

39:30.440 --> 39:33.000
I know it's me and I hate myself for it.

39:33.160 --> 39:35.520
I hate them for making hate necessary.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.800
I'll do what I have to do to end it.

39:42.440 --> 39:43.640
Fancy a good time?

39:43.720 --> 39:45.400
Not tonight, girls.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.920
Relax, you bastard.

40:11.960 --> 40:14.520
Dev, two minutes to the next watch.

40:20.360 --> 40:21.400
Fuck's sake.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.080
Mind your language.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.000
The bleeding key broke.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.880
I'll try mine.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.680
You can't. The fucking keyhole's jammed.

40:32.840 --> 40:35.480
That's no excuse for obscenities.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.840
Maybe I can force it out.

40:42.280 --> 40:43.560
Come on, Mick.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.080
Come on!

40:45.600 --> 40:47.240
Come on, Dev. Push.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.320
Got it! Got it!

40:54.840 --> 40:56.160
Emergency supplies!

40:56.240 --> 40:57.960
Man, you are blessed.

41:00.440 --> 41:01.800
What's this?

41:02.880 --> 41:05.320
A fur coat. Pretend you're a whore.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.400
Come on! Up ahead!

41:14.560 --> 41:17.160
All I'm missing is the high heels.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.040
Drive! Hop to!

41:23.400 --> 41:24.960
Get out! Get out!

41:41.880 --> 41:43.280
You look good in furs.

41:43.360 --> 41:47.480
There are certain things
one should not do for one's country.

41:47.640 --> 41:50.000
Like what? Go on the game?

41:50.200 --> 41:53.400
Some died for lreland,
but Dev whored for lreland.

41:54.040 --> 41:57.320
I suppose it does set
a historical precedent.

41:57.480 --> 41:59.880
I'll take you home again, Kathleen.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.840
I see you've had fun in my absence.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.960
Right. Fun and games all the way, chief.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.160
I know.

42:07.880 --> 42:09.720
I read the papers.

42:17.320 --> 42:18.880
God, we're famous.

42:19.080 --> 42:23.480
No, he is. Lay low for a week.
That nose of his is hard to hide.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.880
Then all of Dublin can throw a hooley.

42:26.560 --> 42:29.160
- Did Dev speak to you?
- About what?

42:29.280 --> 42:31.200
He wants to go to America.

42:32.040 --> 42:34.680
Aye. And he wants me to go with him.

42:38.280 --> 42:39.760
You can't do this to me!

42:39.840 --> 42:42.280
I want American public support and...

42:42.440 --> 42:45.160
recognition from the U.S.
for an Irish Republic.

42:45.240 --> 42:48.920
I want international opinion brought
to bear on the British government.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.240
There's only one force they
understand and you know it!

42:51.320 --> 42:53.240
Our job is at home!

42:53.800 --> 42:56.440
Our job is where I say it is.

42:56.600 --> 42:58.920
As president of the Irish Republic...

42:59.040 --> 43:02.080
l want recognition from the U.S.

43:02.360 --> 43:05.640
Go to America then, blast you!
But leave me Boland!

43:06.440 --> 43:08.640
What's so special about Harry?

43:08.800 --> 43:10.920
- I can't do it without him.
- Do what?

43:11.000 --> 43:13.440
I can't run a war without Harry Boland!

43:14.560 --> 43:16.680
You could run it without me.

43:34.040 --> 43:36.760
Christ, all of Dublin must be out there,
Harry.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Look! Look at the face on Smith.

43:39.080 --> 43:41.080
So near, yet he can't touch him.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.760
Don't worry. He'll try.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.240
Not here, he won't.

43:44.320 --> 43:47.480
No. But we can't let the
Long Fella hang around.

43:56.360 --> 43:57.960
Harry, come on! Move!

43:58.120 --> 43:59.320
Dev!

43:59.480 --> 44:00.440
Chief!

44:06.200 --> 44:07.560
Good luck, mates.

44:14.080 --> 44:16.000
- Open up!
- Get out of my house!

44:18.120 --> 44:19.240
Upstairs!

44:47.880 --> 44:50.760
Remember one thing.
You're my chief, always!

44:51.000 --> 44:52.040
Go on!

45:10.560 --> 45:11.440
Move!

45:19.480 --> 45:23.120
Since you Dublin boyos
can't sort out this Collins...

45:23.320 --> 45:25.080
I suppose it's up to us.

45:26.200 --> 45:28.960
Files on the IRB, England,
Scotland, America.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.880
The Irish Volunteers.

45:31.120 --> 45:32.920
Sinn Fein, more Sinn Fein.

45:33.080 --> 45:34.280
Forget files!

45:34.520 --> 45:38.800
I want anyone with a remote connection
to this geezer lifted! Tonight!

45:39.800 --> 45:41.480
It's not that simple, sir.

45:41.560 --> 45:44.120
But it is that simple, Mr. Broy.

45:44.680 --> 45:46.480
We'll make it that simple.

45:52.720 --> 45:54.640
There's a new regime in here...

45:54.720 --> 45:56.440
and it's starting now!

45:57.320 --> 45:58.960
Good day, Mr. Broy.

46:00.040 --> 46:02.480
Belfast efficiency's what they need.

46:13.880 --> 46:16.960
Passport.
You're Harry Clyne till you get there.

46:17.680 --> 46:21.240
Here's a birth-cert for you,
some money and the like.

46:21.400 --> 46:22.280
There.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.440
Thanks, Mick.

46:23.520 --> 46:27.280
Fuck and blast him!
I told him I can't do without you!

46:30.680 --> 46:32.680
Why do you think he chose me?

46:34.760 --> 46:36.840
He's scared to leave us together.

46:38.520 --> 46:42.160
We might achieve the Republic
he's talking to the world about.

46:44.440 --> 46:45.880
I don't know.

46:46.960 --> 46:50.680
They're filling up the Castle from Belfast.
Things'll get rough.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.640
Rougher than we can imagine.

46:53.960 --> 46:56.160
You don't let them near you, hear me?

46:57.040 --> 46:58.280
Don't let them near you.

46:58.360 --> 47:01.840
They can't imagine a gunman in
a pinstriped suit on a bicycle.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.720
Fuck it. It's worked for us so far.

47:05.240 --> 47:08.440
Let's hope my luck holds
and the wheels don't buckle.

47:09.600 --> 47:11.480
- Coming to the train?
- I will.

47:11.600 --> 47:13.720
There's someone to say hello to.

47:14.560 --> 47:16.920
Yeah? I wonder who that is, now.

47:18.240 --> 47:20.680
She needs looking after while I'm away.

47:25.240 --> 47:27.680
- He's leaving me, Mick.
- I thought he was leaving me.

47:27.760 --> 47:30.280
Shut up, you two. I'm leaving no one.

47:31.120 --> 47:33.520
Do all the women in America
wear trousers?

47:33.600 --> 47:36.400
Yes. Shameless hussies, the lot of them.

47:38.040 --> 47:39.360
Did you hear?

47:39.520 --> 47:42.160
A butterfly's been seen in West Clare.

47:42.320 --> 47:45.120
Its wings are green, white and yellow.

47:45.880 --> 47:47.320
It's a sign.

47:47.480 --> 47:48.760
My foot.

47:48.920 --> 47:51.240
- I'm telling you.
- Know the problem of butterflies?

47:51.320 --> 47:53.160
- What?
- They only last one day.

47:53.240 --> 47:54.720
But what a day, Mick.

47:54.880 --> 47:57.040
- This one's empty.
- What a day.

47:57.760 --> 48:00.280
I leave you so. Here's your ticket.

48:04.120 --> 48:05.960
It'll be all right.

48:06.400 --> 48:07.560
I pray it will.

48:07.640 --> 48:08.840
See you, Mick.

48:19.960 --> 48:21.400
I don't want to go.

48:23.160 --> 48:24.680
- Will you write?
- I will.

48:24.760 --> 48:26.040
You promise?

48:26.200 --> 48:27.280
See you.

48:38.840 --> 48:39.840
Papers, miss.

48:39.920 --> 48:41.400
Lads, lads...

48:41.560 --> 48:44.200
let a man say good-bye
to his wife in peace.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.040
Sorry, Kitty.

48:50.120 --> 48:51.960
We call it taking liberties.

48:52.120 --> 48:54.280
I promised Harry I'd look after you.

48:54.400 --> 48:55.400
Come on.

50:04.920 --> 50:06.680
Take a section each.

50:07.160 --> 50:10.680
The sooner we finish,
the sooner we go home.

50:10.840 --> 50:12.760
Toothcomb, gentlemen.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.040
Toothcomb.

50:16.760 --> 50:19.000
Black and Tan scum!

50:21.600 --> 50:22.960
Fuck off!

50:23.520 --> 50:26.800
We put up with this bollox
every fucking day!

50:29.880 --> 50:31.720
Stupid Irish cow!

50:53.560 --> 50:55.960
I love trains. Don't you, Ned?

50:56.440 --> 50:58.320
What's so special about them?

50:59.040 --> 51:01.920
They make me think of places
I know I'll never see.

51:06.640 --> 51:10.000
They're the elite of the
British Secret Service.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.400
Churchill handpicked them.

51:12.480 --> 51:14.400
Give me everything you've got.

51:22.240 --> 51:23.640
No addresses?

51:23.960 --> 51:25.560
They keep to themselves.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.760
They were sent here for one reason.

51:30.520 --> 51:33.040
To eliminate you and your boys.

51:37.160 --> 51:39.280
I can't hold on much longer, Mick.

51:40.600 --> 51:42.400
It's pulling me to ribbons.

51:42.920 --> 51:46.040
Neither can I, Ned.
But sure keep it a secret.

51:56.720 --> 51:59.440
Doesn't he have a face, this Collins?

52:00.640 --> 52:03.440
Doesn't he have corporeal form?

52:07.240 --> 52:08.680
This the best you've got?

52:08.760 --> 52:10.040
Afraid so, sir.

52:12.240 --> 52:13.720
That'll be all, boy.

52:14.400 --> 52:16.080
Broy, sir.

52:17.080 --> 52:18.160
Broy.

52:20.080 --> 52:21.560
Yes. Broy.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.880
Trouble you for a light, sir?

52:53.840 --> 52:54.720
Ta.

53:11.760 --> 53:15.160
So that's Mr. Soames. How many to go?

53:15.440 --> 53:16.480
Nineteen.

53:16.600 --> 53:17.760
Tom, move.

53:23.320 --> 53:25.560
I'll handle it, Liam. Tom.

53:29.720 --> 53:31.240
How are you, Charlie?

53:31.720 --> 53:33.040
This is Rosie.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.840
How are you? Sit down.

53:36.120 --> 53:37.920
Tell him about Mr. Soames.

53:38.160 --> 53:40.120
Well, he tips me every day.

53:40.400 --> 53:41.880
Not like some.

53:42.040 --> 53:43.600
What time does he get up?

53:43.680 --> 53:45.080
I come in at nine.

53:45.200 --> 53:48.240
He's washing behind the screen,
so I don't see him.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.920
I empty the basket and take the linen.

53:51.120 --> 53:53.920
And then he reaches over the screen
with a half-crown.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.360
You shouldn't take it.

53:55.440 --> 53:56.880
He's a gentleman.

53:57.040 --> 53:58.960
And you're a lady. Shut up, you.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.640
Thank you, Mr. Collins.

54:00.720 --> 54:03.000
Show him what you got from the basket.

54:07.000 --> 54:07.960
Ta.

54:09.360 --> 54:10.320
Come on.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.080
God bless you, Rosie.

54:34.240 --> 54:35.520
We've got them.

54:41.200 --> 54:43.000
They have more experience.

54:43.200 --> 54:46.840
You'll get only once chance.
It's either them or us.

54:47.120 --> 54:50.680
We hit them at daybreak.
If you're not up to it, say so now.

54:51.400 --> 54:54.000
I know what some of you
have been through.

54:54.160 --> 54:56.160
There's no shame in pulling out.

54:58.320 --> 54:59.360
Thank you.

54:59.440 --> 55:01.360
Don't stay in your usual places...

55:01.440 --> 55:03.200
Vaughan's, Cleary's Pub.

55:03.280 --> 55:05.440
If any of us are lifted, we're dead!

55:05.680 --> 55:06.760
Understood?

55:07.480 --> 55:08.920
Let's go.

55:24.080 --> 55:26.320
I got a message for you from Kitty.

55:27.160 --> 55:29.200
- Where is she?
- Vaughan's.

55:41.560 --> 55:43.200
Get your things, Kitty.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.720
- Couldn't you say hello?
- Hello.

55:47.120 --> 55:49.880
- What are you doing?
- Harry told me to look out for you.

55:49.960 --> 55:51.360
You've heard of common courtesy?

55:51.440 --> 55:52.280
No.

55:53.400 --> 55:54.480
Kitty, please. You can't stay here.

55:54.560 --> 55:56.280
- Why?
- Don't ask questions.

55:57.400 --> 55:58.360
Come on!

56:12.800 --> 56:15.360
If any of our lads come in,
tell them to stay somewhere else.

56:15.440 --> 56:17.720
- Where?
- Anywhere else! And look sharp!

56:28.400 --> 56:31.920
Sufficient unto the day
the evil thereof, boy?

56:32.440 --> 56:33.680
Yes, sir.

56:34.120 --> 56:35.760
Or is it Broy?

56:36.480 --> 56:38.000
Broy, sir.

56:39.800 --> 56:40.880
Good night.

56:49.680 --> 56:50.960
Stay on him.

56:55.160 --> 56:56.560
You're hurting me.

56:57.240 --> 56:59.520
I said, you're hurting me!

56:59.640 --> 57:01.200
Kitty, please.

57:02.520 --> 57:03.640
Please.

57:42.840 --> 57:44.000
The Gresham.

57:44.080 --> 57:46.480
Can't tell you...no, everything's fine.

57:46.680 --> 57:48.400
Call me if anything's up.

58:12.120 --> 58:13.080
Come in!

58:15.800 --> 58:17.640
Where will you have it, Mr. Grace?

58:17.720 --> 58:18.680
Here.

58:20.240 --> 58:21.840
- Ta.
- Thank you.

58:28.080 --> 58:29.400
I'm going, Mick.

58:29.560 --> 58:32.400
You can't!
Why do you think I brought you here?

58:32.560 --> 58:34.000
I don't know why!

58:36.880 --> 58:38.640
Vaughan's isn't safe.

58:40.320 --> 58:41.520
Not tonight.

58:51.920 --> 58:53.680
Sweet mother of God!

59:01.400 --> 59:03.040
What was on the paper, Paddy?

59:03.120 --> 59:04.000
Words.

59:04.080 --> 59:05.360
Just words.

59:09.800 --> 59:11.600
What's happening tonight?

59:11.880 --> 59:13.520
You don't want to know.

59:14.320 --> 59:16.080
Am I allowed to guess?

59:18.000 --> 59:19.440
Heard from Harry?

59:21.560 --> 59:22.520
Yes.

59:24.440 --> 59:25.520
He wrote.

59:27.760 --> 59:29.360
He always writes.

59:31.400 --> 59:34.440
When you both came to Granard
the first time, you....

59:36.560 --> 59:38.480
But he was the one that wrote.

59:39.240 --> 59:40.680
Why was that, Mick?

59:42.120 --> 59:44.360
He's the writing type, Harry.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.400
What type are you?

59:55.760 --> 59:57.320
Let me go!

59:57.480 --> 59:59.760
I know exactly where I'm going!

59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.040
I can walk!

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.760
I can walk!

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.760
Promise me something, Kitty.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.600
Anything.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.960
Promise me you'll never care about me.
Please.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.160
I promise.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.680
That's the trouble with the Irish.
They sing at the drop of a hat.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.760
Ask them to talk and they won't.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.120
Do what you have to do.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.600
You've sent your boys out, haven't you?

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.000
It's written on your face.

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.480
Every step they take.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.280
Like so many valentines.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.640
Delivering bouquets.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.440
Do you send a love note, Mick...

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.240
with the flowers?

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.120
What does it say?

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.400
Do it now!

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.520
Jesus!

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.880
Come on!

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.160
Go!

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.360
It says, "Leave us be!"

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.240
Is that all?

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.560
Not very romantic.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.280
Move away from her.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.440
You could at least
spare my wife this spectacle.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.440
Take her outside.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.040
I'm not his bloody wife!

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.320
Say your prayers.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.720
You know what it says, Kitty?

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.240
It says, "Give us the future.
We've had enough of your past".

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.080
The Lord is my shepherd....

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.000
"Give us our country back...

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.080
"to live in...

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.520
"to grow in...

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.600
"to love".

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.640
So there is love there, Mick.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.960
Hang on, Rosie.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.640
Clean sheets, I think.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.840
Come on!

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.920
So, Mick...

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.240
flowers delivered.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.240
Do you think they got the message?

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.800
Any casualties?

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.040
Any casualties?

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.440
Are you deaf?

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.680
Broy.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.920
Ned - fucking - Broy!

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.960
What are you talking about?
Broy wasn't out.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.120
They lifted him at Vaughan's.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.640
What was he doing?

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.520
Oh, sweet mother of Jesus.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.600
Can't risk it any longer, Mick.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.400
Who'll give in first, Joe?

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.840
Us or them?

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.360
The body or the lash?

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.200
You look like a gangster!

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.640
You look like a ghost!

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.800
Welcome back, Harry!

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.560
How are you keeping?

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.040
Grand.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.120
You're famous over there.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.280
Where?

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.640
Over there, you thick.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.000
So, how was America?

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.360
Great.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.520
Dev never got to meet the President.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.800
I didn't think he would.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.399
How are you?

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:29.760
I'm grand.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.359
Welcome back, chief.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.160
The Big Fella sends his regards.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.760
We'll see who is the big fella.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.120
Apologies, gentlemen.

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:26.640
As you may know...

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.520
we have had some communication
from the British side.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.960
There is a slim possibility...

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.279
that they might want to talk.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.640
But our...

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:49.760
tactics...

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:55.520
allowed the British press
to paint us as murderers.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.360
If we are to negotiate
as a legitimate government...

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.760
our armed forces must act...

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.360
like a legitimate army.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.640
What exactly do you mean, Dev?

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.560
I mean large-scale engagements.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.680
You mean, like in 1916?

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.960
The great heroic ethic of failure...

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.360
marching to slaughter.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.680
Why don't we save them the bother
and blow our own brains out?

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.880
How dare you!

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.800
How did we get them to this point...

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.480
to consider talking?

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.520
We brought them to their knees
the only way we could!

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.200
They call us...

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.640
murderers.

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.960
War is murder! Sheer, bloody murder!

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.080
Had you been here the past year,
you'd know that!

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.600
I propose an assault...

01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:01.960
on the administrative center
of British rule in lreland:

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.200
The Customs House.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.760
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.840
How many lost?

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:23.280
6 dead, 70 taken! Bloody fiasco!

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.360
Christ, not again!

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.800
The guns!

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.480
We need the guns!

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.920
Leave them!

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.240
There's nothing we can do.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.480
There's nothing we can do.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.840
How much longer can we hold out?

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.960
Four weeks. But keep it a secret.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.680
As little as that?

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.640
Unless we use bows and arrows.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.160
Don't be flippant, Michael.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.040
We nearly lost 80 men last week, Dev.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.120
You tell him, Harry.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.760
He's right, chief.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.200
I lied.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.160
You lied? About what?

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.040
We can't hold out for another week.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.120
Christ! Do they know that?

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.720
Nobody knows.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.080
Mick, Dev's negotiating.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.440
Yes, so he doesn't know either.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.960
It's very important he doesn't know.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.640
The world must believe we're invincible.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.480
Maybe then we can talk.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.600
Jesus Christ.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.640
Kitty's down.

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.280
So I heard.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.760
Is she down to see you or me?

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.600
Maybe both of us.

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.800
You take her down to Kingstown.
Get some sea air.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.520
No, why don't you take her?

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.360
No, you take her.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
- No, you take her.
- No, you do.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.880
A horse called "Irish Republic"
ran at Donnybrook today.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.800
What were the odds?

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.760
- 50-to-1.
- Jesus, some odds, what?

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.640
There's 100,000 Tommies here
and not 2,000 of us.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.520
I'd say 50-to-1 is optimistic.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.520
Optimistic or no...

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.720
she won.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.240
No, you're joking?

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.000
10 bob each way, that makes Â£25...

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.480
plus the place money, Â£7,10.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.920
So I won...

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.640
Â£33,10, thank you very much.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.880
Let the Irish Republic buy us dinner.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.400
I know just where to go.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.720
Which one of you will ask me to dance?

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.840
- Me, me, me, please!
- No, I will. I will.

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.280
Heads, it's Harry. Tails, it's Mick.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.840
- Kitty, may I have the pleasure?
- The gangster wins again.

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.640
Watch his feet, Kitty.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.120
Shut up, you.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.160
I shouldn't have left, should I?

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.480
Why not?

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.360
I was a length ahead.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.800
Now where am I?

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.920
It's not a race, Harry.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.760
Mind telling me what it is, then?

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.240
You without him...

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.920
him without you...

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.080
l can't imagine it.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.720
Three-legged race.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.360
Mick, where the hell have you been?

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.880
For God's sake, give me one
free night to be a human being!

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.040
We looked all over! Have you heard?

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.480
No, I haven't heard!

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:10.400
Would the bloody Irish Republic
leave me some time off?

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.840
It's over!

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.040
What's over?

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.400
It's over.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.280
They called a truce.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.800
It's finished?

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.880
- The whole damn thing.
- Yes.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.280
We've won?

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.840
Lloyd George has thrown in the towel?

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:34.320
We've brought the British Empire
to its knees?

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:35.600
Yes.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.880
Why the fuck didn't you say so?

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.240
What was that horse called?

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.600
We did it! We did it! It's a truce!

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.120
What?

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.960
You must be joking?

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.320
No. I won't do it.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.520
I'm not a politician.
I'm not going to London.

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.320
You're the strongest card we have.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.760
They call me an assassin and a murderer!

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.200
Will Churchill even shake my hand?

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.320
We've broached it and had no objections.

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.160
You go, Dev.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.080
You're the statesman.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.240
You know how far we can push them.
They know you.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.560
That's the point. They don't know you.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.240
Don't do this to me, Dev. Don't do it.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.320
I'm no good at talk.
I'm a yob from West Cork.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.560
Please!

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.880
You'll head our team, Michael...

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.680
to negotiate a treaty
for the first time in history...

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.040
between lreland and England.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.720
We need to keep
a final arbitrator in reserve.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:18.960
You.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.800
That will be the Irish people.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.640
And me...

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.280
as president of the Irish Republic.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.360
Why does he want me there?

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.400
Why?

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.760
- You put the fear of God into them.
- Save me the bullshit.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.440
Mick, you are the strongest card we have.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.600
What's he up to?

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.680
- What are you talking about?
- I have one simple asset.

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.400
All these years,
no one knows what I look like.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.440
Which one of you is Michael Collins?

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.640
He is.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.640
That's him.

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.760
The small fella.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.320
"From your very own plenipotentiary,
to the provisions of the said document...

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.800
"hereinafter to be referred to
as The Letter:

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.800
"They didn't defeat us by force of arms...

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.920
"but now they'll try to
do it by force of verbiage.

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.240
"The English language wasn't
meant to be spoken like that.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.640
"How did these people ever
get to run an empire?"

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.560
Don't.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.400
Why not?

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.440
'Cause you'll get hurt.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.080
How will I get hurt?

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:05.760
I'm in love with him.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.680
I'm sorry.

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.880
I have to tell you.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.080
Have you told him?

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.160
No.

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:30.560
And maybe I never will.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:36.120
I'm only telling you
because I can't hurt you.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.280
Lucky Mick.

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:11.120
I did my best, Kitty,
but it won't be good enough.

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.640
We'll have an Irish Free State,
instead of an Irish Republic.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.640
We'll have our own government.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.920
But we have to swear allegiance
to the English Crown.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.320
The position of the
north will be reviewed...

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.440
but now it remains part
of the British Empire.

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.000
This treaty isjust a steppingstone.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.400
I hope the country sees it as such.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.400
How are you?

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.040
Is this true?

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.280
It's the best anyone could have got.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.680
This gives up the north...

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.840
divides the country.

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:56.800
You expect us to give an oath
of allegiance to the Crown?

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.520
They can't comprehend
giving us the Republic.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.680
And that's why Dev sent me.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:03.760
What?

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.000
He knew we'd get no Republic.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.640
He wanted me to bring back the bad news.

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:13.600
We can use the Irish Free State
to achieve the Republic we want.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.520
It's either this or war.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.240
I won't go to war over words.

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:22.080
What if it's war either way, Mick?

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:27.600
You published the terms
without my agreement!

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.520
- They were the best we could get.
- In your opinion!

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:35.360
You sent me there knowing
they were the best we'd get.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:38.080
- Idle speculation.
- No, it's the truth.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.240
Or else you'd have gone yourself.

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.160
We don't have the Republic...

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.360
but freedom to achieve it.
Peacefully.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.680
Surely it's time for peace.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:52.000
What would you know about peace?

01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:00.040
You said we could negotiate
on behalf of our government...

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:03.040
the D il and the Irish people.

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.480
If they reject it, I'll reject it.

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.640
If they stand by it, I'll stand by it.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.080
I want to know you'll do the same.

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.200
Will you come in for a pint?

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.640
He's read the papers.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.560
Say something, would you?

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.120
I've known the two of you for four years.

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.280
You've slept together,
lived together, fought together.

01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.560
But your war is over now.

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.160
What if it's just the beginning?

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.160
Christ.

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.240
I'd be better off in Longford.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.600
We were elected by the people of lreland...

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.600
We were elected by the people.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:55.160
Did they think we were liars when we
meant to uphold the Irish Republic?

01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:00.800
The letters preceding the negotiations...

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.640
not once demanded recognition
of the Irish Republic!

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:08.080
We knew it would have been refused!

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.400
So Mr. Collins is asking us...

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.840
to accept an oath of allegiance
to a foreign king...

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.840
and the partition...

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.000
and the partition of the northern part
of the country!

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:23.800
Mr. Collins,
the man who won the recent war...

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.960
has himself described the treaty...

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.920
as a steppingstone toward
the ultimate freedom!

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:37.640
Mr. Griffith has described Mr. Collins
as the man who won the war!

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.880
Point of order, Mr. Chairman.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.120
Are we discussing the treaty or myself?

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.200
The minister does not like what I say!

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.960
Anything about me, say it!

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.600
Mr. Collins, your position in the army...

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:55.480
was as chief of one subsection.

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.760
Nobody sought notoriety except you!

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.600
Come on, Cathal!

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.080
One person was held up by the press...

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:08.920
and put into a position he never held.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:12.120
He was made a romantic figure...

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.080
a mystical character...

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.960
which he certainly is not!

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:21.200
The person I refer to is Michael Collins!

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.400
I would plead...

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.000
with every person here.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:43.880
Make me a scapegoat, if you will.
Call me a traitor, if you will.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.480
But please, let's save the country.

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:51.200
The alternative to this treaty is a war...

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:55.240
which nobody in this gathering
can even contemplate.

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.840
If the price of freedom...

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.560
the price of peace,
is blackening my name...

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.080
l will gladly pay it.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.120
Thank you.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.240
The result, ladies and gentlemen...

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.520
is 64 to 57.

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.880
A majority of seven...

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.760
in favor of the treaty.

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:58.480
There is one thing I want to say.

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.880
I want it to go...

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.880
to the country...

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.760
and to the world.

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:14.680
And it is this:

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.960
The Irish people established the Republic.

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.600
It can only...

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.320
be disestablished...

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:29.600
by the Irish people.

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.720
As a protest...

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.440
against the ratification of this treaty...

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.920
which can only subvert...

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.600
the Republic...

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:50.800
I...

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.560
and my deputies...

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.120
are leaving this house.

01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:14.680
Traitors!

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.280
Traitors, all!

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.960
Not you, Harry.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.920
All right, you've won.

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.680
You always win, Mr. Collins.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.000
Rarely, Miss Kiernan.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.600
Very rarely.

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.000
Jesus, I hate you.

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.960
Sure. Join the club.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.280
You're seven minutes late, Mr. Collins.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.480
You've kept us waiting 700 years.

01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.640
You can have your seven minutes.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.920
Let's get this over with.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.000
Company, present arms!

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:35.720
So that's what caused all the bother?

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.080
Now what?

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.280
Do I get to wear that hat?

01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:56.080
This treaty...

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.040
bars the way to the Republic...

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.080
with the blood...

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:04.600
of fellow Irishmen!

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:15.000
If it is only with civil war...

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:19.000
that we can get our independence...

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:21.720
then so be it!

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.880
The Volunteers...

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:45.640
will have to wade through Irish blood...

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:52.360
through the blood of some members
of this government...

01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:55.320
in order to get...

01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.520
Irish freedom!

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:05.280
After 700 years....

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:07.280
After 700 years....

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:25.240
Let him speak!

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.680
Kitty, don't!

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:28.120
Leave him be!

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:32.440
You put the heart across me, Kitty.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.560
I like the sound of your voice.

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.440
They won't accept the treaty.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.240
No matter how the vote goes.

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.240
You heard what de Valera said.

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.760
"And to wade through rivers of blood..."

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.200
And who's blood you think
he's talking about?

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.160
Yours.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.720
Will you marry me?

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.400
Yeah.

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:00.520
You will?

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.960
It's that simple?

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:07.480
Yeah.

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:19.320
Who gave you that, you little runt?

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:22.400
What's all this about?

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:24.680
- We've taken over the Four Courts.
- You fucking fool!

01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:25.640
Mind your language.

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.360
You'll start a civil war!

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.040
We'll defend the Republic.

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.680
These kids don't know guns!

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:33.320
- We know how to train them.
- The way I trained you?

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.760
- On whose orders?
- The Volunteer Executive.

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.280
Dev's part of it?

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:38.720
His half of it?

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:42.520
Go away home to your mothers,
all of you!

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:48.720
You know what this means?

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:50.640
The army's split down the middle.

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:52.760
- Who's in there?
- Mellowes, Lynch...

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.680
Tom Barry, Oscar Traynor.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.120
Keep it off.

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:09.800
Why?

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:12.320
There's a gunman outside by the railings.

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.680
Jesus' sake.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.400
They won't shoot me, then.

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:22.520
Jesus, what are you doing to me?

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.400
They can shoot us, but they can't get us.

01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:27.680
- What are you talking about?
- It's not possible.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.840
I'm going to live to see you old.

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:31.960
I am old.

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:34.760
Old enough to see your hair turn grey.

01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:37.080
I come from a long line of baldies.

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.320
Bald, then.

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:39.920
I can live with that.

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:47.040
I will not fight against men I trained with,
I fought with!

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:51.560
The people have spoken
for the treaty you brought home!

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.160
They've occupied the Four Courts,
Limerick, Cork. It's anarchy.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:56.880
Better anarchy than civil war!

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:00.280
- Churchill offered artillery!
- He can do his own dirty work!

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.320
Maybe he will, Michael.

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.120
Maybe he will.

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:14.720
Stop!

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.000
- It's not safe...
- Do as you're told.

01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:32.480
Harry, talk to me, will you?

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.280
I don't want any bullshit, Mick.

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:35.640
Neither do l.

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.680
Come upstairs.

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.080
Is it true what I heard?

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:55.880
You're engaged?

01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:58.960
Should I apologize for that, too?

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:01.240
No, no, no.

01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:03.280
I'm happy for you both.

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:05.160
Me arse. You don't look it.

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:07.760
Maybe I don't, but I'm trying.

01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.760
Do you understand? I'm trying.

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.720
I miss the way it used to be.

01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:24.320
Me too.

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.720
I hear you're Dev's right-hand man.

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:32.480
Well, I suppose that's how it goes.

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:35.960
We were too dangerous together.

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:41.560
Know the funny thing, Harry?

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.880
For the first time in my life, I'm scared.

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:52.280
The Big Fella, scared?

01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:57.680
I hate to say it, Mick,
but you've a right to be.

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:00.480
You don't understand me.

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:04.640
You told me once
I was good at bloody mayhem.

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:05.880
Right.

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.720
I left the Brits in the halfpenny place.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.440
That's what I'm scared of,
because once I start...

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:11.800
there'll be no stopping me.

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.680
Don't let it start, then.

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.520
Tear up that treaty.

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.520
It's the only thing we've got.

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:29.120
So, then it starts.

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:30.240
What?

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:33.040
We fight.

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.440
They fight. We don't.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:39.240
You've said what you had to say
and you can go now.

01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:41.840
Listen,
you don't know what you're saying!

01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:44.440
I have nothing more to say to you!

01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.520
- Do it!
- Put the gun down!

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:51.880
Save us all a lot of bother. Do it!

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.600
Put the gun down.

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:59.360
Do you not hear me!
I said put the gun down!

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:03.440
Get out!

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.440
- Do it!
- Fire!

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.640
How would you like a new boss, Joe?

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:30.200
Check the other side.

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.600
What happened?

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:50.160
They shot their way to the Catacombs.
He thinks Harry was with them.

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:52.360
- Let's go.
- Mick, it's not safe!

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.200
We'll never get through!

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.280
Stop!

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.480
Stop!

01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:52.720
Come on! Come on!

01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.320
Calm down! It's the Big Fella!

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.200
What happened?

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:21.680
Who closed your eyes?

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:24.920
He tried to run across the river, sir.
I plugged him.

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:27.280
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:28.920
You asked who?

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:30.960
I fucking asked him!

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:33.800
- But he's dead, sir.
- And you killed him, you little git!

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:36.320
You plugged him,
you Free State gob-shite!

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:38.640
- You were meant to protect him!
- He was one of them, sir!

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.760
No, sonny! You don't understand.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.560
He was one of us.

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:46.120
Go on!

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.200
Back to your posts.

01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:59.640
The papers said his last words were:

01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:03.200
"Have they got Mick Collins yet?"

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.840
You know it's not true, Mick.

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:11.120
I don't know anything, anymore.

01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:20.200
Tell Dev Mick wants to talk.
Nothing more, nothing less.

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.720
Not in Dublin.

01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:23.080
Where, then?

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:24.440
West Cork...

01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:26.760
there might be a chance.

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.880
He'd never get out of there alive.

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:30.440
Doesn't he come from there?

01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:32.240
That's bandit country.

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:34.520
They're bandits he trained, aren't they?

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.080
Maybe.
But Mick doesn't know the new boys.

01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:40.080
He'll have to get to know them now.

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:43.840
Gentlemen.

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:07.920
What time is it?

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:10.320
Seven. Have you been here all night?

01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:11.600
Any news?

01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:14.920
They say if you went to Cork
there might be a possibility.

01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:16.120
Fuck!

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:18.600
What do you think?

01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:22.520
We've cleared them out
except for West Cork.

01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.560
They wouldn't kill me in my own county.

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:31.200
How would you like a new boss, Joe?

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:34.520
Still, be nice to go home.

01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.360
- You'd be crazy to go.
- So, I'm crazy.

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.400
Get the convoy together.

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:42.600
Go on.

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.440
- What?
- Here. For the cough.

01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:54.800
Here. New handkerchief.

01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:59.240
Go on! You're like an old clucking hen,
fussing all the time!

01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:15.880
Sweet suffering Jesus!

01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:18.080
If you're going down, I'm going too.

01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:37.160
That's where it all started, Joe.

01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:39.200
Fenian stories by the fireside.

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.560
That's your home?

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.480
Was, till the Tans burned it.

01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:49.720
What are you doing here, Mick?

01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:51.480
Haven't I a civil war to run?

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:53.200
Come on! It's my round.

01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:08.160
Come to flog us that bloody treaty,
have you?

01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:10.720
I'm flogging fuck-all.
I've come to buy.

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:12.640
Drinks for the county on me.

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.400
Come on, four pints.

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:43.800
Is it him?

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:46.640
Looks like it.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.840
Looks like he wants to meet.

01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:59.200
Can I trust him?

01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:02.200
Can you trust anyone these days, chief?

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:27.120
"Oh, well do I remember...

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:28.960
"the year of '48

01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:31.800
"When I rose with comrades
brave and true

01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:37.600
"l was hunted through the hills by slaves

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:40.400
"Who served a foreign queen

01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.120
"And that's

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:44.440
"Another reason why

01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:47.160
"I left old Skibereen"

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:58.360
Say it to me, kid.

01:51:58.440 --> 01:51:59.800
Put it away, Joe.

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:01.680
Who the fuck are you?

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:06.320
Who the fuck am l?

01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:11.280
I'm the fucker that asked to meet Dev.

01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:12.840
And who's Dev?

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.320
And who are you?

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:19.280
If I did know this Dev,
what would you say to him?

01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:25.720
Tell him...

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:28.040
Harry Boland's death was enough.

01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:33.200
Tell him Mick Collins wants to stop
this bloody mayhem.

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:38.480
Tell him I'm sorry
I didn't bring back the Republic.

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:40.360
But nobody could have!

01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:49.160
He was my chief, always.

01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:52.560
I'd have followed him to hell
if he'd asked me.

01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:56.840
And maybe I did.

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.280
But it's not worth fighting for anymore.

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:10.640
We've got to build with what we have!

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:13.200
You tell him that.

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.880
Where can he find you?

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:19.120
Here.

01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:38.960
So, I take it you heard?

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.080
Jesus, Mick.

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:48.280
God forgive us, Harry.

01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:50.480
Have you got any reply?

01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:59.400
He's come all this way.

01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:02.520
Be rude not to give him an answer.

01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:28.480
Well?

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
He says he'll meet you tomorrow.

01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:32.920
What's wrong with now?

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.160
His nerves are at him.

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:39.680
Beal Na Blath. A farmhouse
to the left on the Bandon side.

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:42.040
Around 12:00.

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:46.040
Hey kid...what's your name?

01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:51.800
Little snot.

01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.320
Beal Na Blath?

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.400
Should I ask them all to the wedding?

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:17.960
Do you think that'd fix it?

01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:19.960
Be a big bloody wedding, Mick.

01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:24.480
We'll invite the whole country.
Marital diplomacy.

01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:29.160
Dev as best man. Lloyd George,
Winston Churchill as bridesmaids.

01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:54.000
What's up?

01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:55.920
We're stopped?

01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:58.960
Roadblock.

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.440
Move it!

01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:03.720
Get those carts off the road!

01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:10.880
How long?

01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:12.080
Two minutes.

01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:17.040
Jeez, they're trying to fucking kill me.

01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:18.200
Get down!

01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:34.600
Give it to me! Get off!

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.560
No! Jeez, Mick!

01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:15.880
Talk to me!

01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:19.160
Don't go!

01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:20.880
Don't go, Mick!

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:27.240
Jesus, don't go on us, Mick! Please!

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:45.920
Miss Kiernan?

01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:57.800
I'm sorry.

01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:01.640
I just heard.

01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:04.240
I'm sorry.

01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:19.880
That's why he died, Kitty.

01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:23.120
He knew the risk
he was taking to go there.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.040
But he thought it worth taking.

01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:29.480
He took them for us.

01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:32.720
For every gob-shite in this country,
no matter what side.

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:37.760
If he saw you now,
know what he'd say?

01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:44.920
"Get off the parliamentary side
of your arse and get some color".

01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:48.520
He would have said it better, Joe.

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:52.840
"No regrets, Kit".
That's what he'd say.
