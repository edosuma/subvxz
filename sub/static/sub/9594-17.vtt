00:25.726 --> 00:30.164
There's no room for your
anti-establishment music in
Jump City, Punk Rocket.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.179
His music is so angry, bro.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.447
What are we going to do?

00:46.547 --> 00:49.517
We fight terrible music
with even worse music.

00:49.617 --> 00:50.784
Titans, go!

00:52.886 --> 00:56.457
You are going down!

00:58.226 --> 00:59.693
And now, to finish you...

01:00.828 --> 01:03.431
Off!

01:13.474 --> 01:15.343
Are you the all right, Robin?

01:15.443 --> 01:17.711
I can't find it!
I can't find it!

01:17.811 --> 01:19.647
-My mask!

01:20.348 --> 01:21.215
So?

01:21.315 --> 01:22.583
Don't you understand?

01:22.683 --> 01:25.319
Without a mask, my face is
revealed to the world!

01:25.419 --> 01:27.321
What's the big deal, dude,
even with the mask

01:27.421 --> 01:28.722
90% of
your face is showing.

01:28.822 --> 01:29.757
You can't see me!

01:29.857 --> 01:31.159
No one can see me!

01:33.561 --> 01:35.496
Must get back to the Tower...

02:04.825 --> 02:06.194
Ah.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.699
Oh, hey guys.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.402
Yo, what's up with you
and that mask, bro?

02:14.502 --> 02:17.171
I've never seen you
act so crazy.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.673
Whoo-hoo!

02:24.412 --> 02:25.846
Well, that's not true.

02:25.946 --> 02:29.417
My mask is the only thing that
conceals my true identity.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.852
And that identity must
never be revealed.

02:31.952 --> 02:35.723
Why do you feel the need to
conceal yourself from us?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.491
You know who we are.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.560
Yeah, but nobody cares
about you guys.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.230
That's why you don't need
a secret identity.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.831
I think he has trust issues.

02:43.931 --> 02:47.201
The truth is, if my identity
was revealed to the world,

02:47.301 --> 02:48.902
it would put you
in harm's way.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.173
Villains would be able to
pinpoint our location and
attack us where we live.

02:53.274 --> 02:56.444
We live in a T shaped tower.
How hard is it to find us now?

02:56.544 --> 02:59.413
-Come on, show us
your face, man.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.316
I did take off my mask, once,

03:02.416 --> 03:04.252
for the original Teen Titans.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.288
Titans, listen up!

03:07.388 --> 03:09.657
This is what I look like
without my mask.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.564
I won't let that happen again.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.366
Mmm...
I'm not buying his story.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.867
He's hiding something.

03:19.967 --> 03:23.871
Maybe if he took off his mask,
his eyeballs would fall out!

03:23.971 --> 03:26.774
-CYBORG: I think he has
a monster unibrow.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.877
STARFIRE: I think he's
hiding the parasitic twin.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.279
Yeah!

03:33.481 --> 03:34.915
That's just weird, Star.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.216
I apologize.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.286
We have to find out the truth!

03:45.893 --> 03:46.960
Ha!

04:08.516 --> 04:09.850
I'm trying to sleep!

04:13.721 --> 04:14.955
-A-ha!

04:15.055 --> 04:16.256
Oh.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.292
A-ha! Oh.

04:18.392 --> 04:21.261
A-ha! Oh.
A-ha! Oh.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.831
A-ha! A-ha!
A-ha! A-ha!

04:37.778 --> 04:39.413
Just let us see!

04:39.513 --> 04:40.614
Never going to happen.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.783
I got to know
what's under there!

04:42.883 --> 04:47.321
We will not stop until we have
penetrated this mystery.
Right, Raven?

04:47.421 --> 04:48.856
I actually stopped
a while ago.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.759
Look, I'm doing all this
to protect you.

04:51.859 --> 04:55.829
I don't tell you this often,
but I truly care for
each one of you.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.898
-Really.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.299
A-ha!

05:09.710 --> 05:11.679
Hey, where are you guys going?

05:11.779 --> 05:13.881
If you cannot share
your secret with us,

05:13.981 --> 05:16.584
then we can
no longer be Teen Titans.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.619
That's right!
We're outta here!

05:18.719 --> 05:20.954
Go find yourself some other
heroes you can trust.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.457
But...
But you can't leave.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.526
I trust you.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.628
Sure doesn't
seem like it, dude.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.599
All right,
if it's come to this...

05:31.699 --> 05:34.702
Then I must reveal
my secret to you.

05:50.684 --> 05:54.422
Dude, you are
so good looking!

05:54.522 --> 05:56.890
I'm freaking out,
he's so beautiful!

05:58.959 --> 06:02.362
STARFIRE: You have the
strong cheekbones of a...

06:02.463 --> 06:03.697
RAVEN: And that jaw line.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.366
BEAST BOY: Such perfect skin.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.035
STARFIRE: And those eyes.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.838
CYBORG: They sparkle
like sunrise on the waters
of a crystal blue lake.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.842
Robin, why did you
hide this beauty from us?

06:19.647 --> 06:20.781
Ah!

06:21.849 --> 06:22.883
Um...

06:26.887 --> 06:30.023
Yeah, can everyone
please stop staring?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.561
Don't spoil this moment
with words.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.801
Stop that!

06:40.901 --> 06:43.504
Do you now see why
I had to hide this from you?

06:43.604 --> 06:45.172
-Uh-uh.
-No, not really.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.908
This face has been my burden.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.042
Burden

06:50.010 --> 06:50.944
We would love to have
a burden like that.

06:51.579 --> 06:52.980
Life would be so amazing.

06:57.818 --> 06:58.919
Hey, nice face.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.689
Thanks, mama,
I like your face, too.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.892
You'll have to excuse me,
I have to accept my award

07:04.992 --> 07:06.894
for best face.

07:06.994 --> 07:10.664
Shall we do the carpool?
It was the four-way tie.

07:16.804 --> 07:20.440
Instead we have to be
so hideous!

07:20.541 --> 07:21.842
We look like the garbage.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.845
Why do we have to be so,
so ugly?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.080
I can't even
look at you trolls!

07:33.987 --> 07:36.857
This is one of the
reasons I didn't want to
show you my face.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.529
And I have a feeling that's
the other reason.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.583
-Ooh.
-Incredible!

08:02.683 --> 08:04.652
Look at that
handsome alien face.

08:04.752 --> 08:07.855
Are we the only butter faces
in the universe?

08:07.955 --> 08:11.859
I am Klatak, Queen of the
Barshalluvian Empire.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.528
I have surveyed the
vast cosmos for eons,

08:14.628 --> 08:18.031
searching for a creature
as beautiful as me,
to be my King.

08:18.131 --> 08:23.070
At long last,
that search has ended,
for I have found you.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.506
You cannot have our Robin!

08:27.775 --> 08:29.910
This beautiful man
belongs to us!

08:30.010 --> 08:32.646
If you will not
give him to me,

08:32.746 --> 08:36.083
then I shall take him,
after I destroy you all.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.186
Then you underestimate me
and my unattractive friends.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.621
Titans, go!

08:52.833 --> 08:54.768
Her technology is
too handsome.

08:54.868 --> 08:55.803
What are we going to do?

08:55.903 --> 08:58.071
Looks like there's no choice.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.575
Dude, you can't go with her!

09:01.675 --> 09:03.577
This is the only way
to protect you.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.680
Come to me, My King.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.983
Yes, but first,
feast your eyes on this.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.693
The beauty has overwhelmed me.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.564
Too beautiful. Too beautiful!

09:32.105 --> 09:33.106
Phew.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.708
You all understand now?

09:34.808 --> 09:38.578
Yeah, dude, put that back on
and keep it on.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.280
For our sake
and for the world's.

09:40.380 --> 09:44.918
Even if it means
we'll never see that
gorgeous face again.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.888
We will always have the memory
of Robin's beauty.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.735
It worked, just as I planned.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.871
I've preserved
my true identity

10:03.971 --> 10:06.039
and no one can
ever find that out.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.744
-Got that right, big bro.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.013
Hook me up with a grape,
why don't ya?

10:15.348 --> 10:17.184
Oh! A sweet one!

10:17.284 --> 10:18.886
I like that.
