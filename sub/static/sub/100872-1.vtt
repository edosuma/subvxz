<i>In the beginning,
he already existed.</i>

01:15.324 --> 01:17.059
<i>He was with God.</i>

01:17.959 --> 01:21.096
<i>And he is God.</i>

01:21.130 --> 01:23.831
<i>Everything was created
through him.</i>

01:23.865 --> 01:27.702
<i>He gave life to everything
that was created,</i>

01:27.735 --> 01:32.141
<i>and his life brought
light to everyone.</i>

01:34.009 --> 01:37.645
<i>That light shines
in the darkness,</i>

01:37.678 --> 01:41.916
<i>and the darkness
can never extinguish it.</i>

01:43.018 --> 01:45.620
Haul them up
and head to shore!

01:45.653 --> 01:47.688
Hauling them up
and heading to shore!

01:47.722 --> 01:50.691
It's just another day at sea!

01:51.393 --> 01:54.962
For the boys
of Galilee!

02:02.737 --> 02:05.640
<i>♪ Before

Boys of Galilee!

02:53.288 --> 02:56.058
Behold
my glorious catch.

02:56.091 --> 02:57.226
You.

02:59.261 --> 03:02.131
Peter!
Just in time.

03:02.164 --> 03:04.166
Uh, since you're
empty-handed,

03:04.199 --> 03:06.201
maybe you and your
little brother can help me

03:06.235 --> 03:08.237
with my huge net of fish.

03:08.270 --> 03:10.305
You tangled our nets.

03:10.339 --> 03:13.008
And you stole
our fishing spot!

03:13.041 --> 03:14.977
Who on earth
would do such a thing?

03:15.010 --> 03:16.744
Your spot?

03:16.777 --> 03:19.680
I had no idea you owned
the entire Galilee, Peter!

03:19.714 --> 03:22.151
Hey, at least I own
my own boat.

03:23.252 --> 03:25.053
That is our boat.

03:25.087 --> 03:26.954
Sure,
sons of Zebedee.

03:26.989 --> 03:28.290
And what's that
supposed to mean?

03:28.323 --> 03:30.292
Everybody knows your
father owns that boat

03:30.325 --> 03:31.893
just like everything else
in Capernaum.

03:31.926 --> 03:34.829
Yeah. Everything except
for these fish.

03:34.862 --> 03:37.865
These belong to me.

03:37.899 --> 03:40.768
You never know
when to quit, do you?

03:40.801 --> 03:42.471
- Never.
- Take them up.

03:43.771 --> 03:46.141
All righty, then,
away we go.

04:07.462 --> 04:09.131
Sorry.

04:09.164 --> 04:10.999
Out of my way!

04:13.968 --> 04:15.037
Don't move!

04:23.178 --> 04:24.313
Time to put an end
to this.

04:28.050 --> 04:28.984
And stay out!

04:29.985 --> 04:31.286
I'm sorry.

04:32.087 --> 04:33.888
Get back here!

04:33.921 --> 04:36.525
Hey, Petey, I got
a little something for you.

04:43.398 --> 04:45.866
My name's
not Petey.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.537
- Peter.
- Andrew. Quick.

04:48.570 --> 04:50.205
- Our fish! Let's go right now.
- No, no, no, no.

04:50.239 --> 04:51.106
James. Here they come.

04:52.474 --> 04:53.741
Get out of my way!

04:54.576 --> 04:55.776
Let's go!

05:02.217 --> 05:03.385
Sorry.

05:03.418 --> 05:04.752
Peter!

05:07.489 --> 05:08.991
Go, go, go.

05:12.261 --> 05:15.230
You want the fish? Fine.
Take them, then.

05:15.264 --> 05:17.165
More fish!

05:19.900 --> 05:22.170
Sons of thunder!

05:22.204 --> 05:24.539
Sons of thunder!

05:24.573 --> 05:27.109
Again.

05:27.142 --> 05:29.511
- Oh, there's my beautiful, bald brother.
- Whoo!

05:29.544 --> 05:32.014
Is that my reflection I see?

05:32.047 --> 05:34.149
Sons of thunder!

05:34.182 --> 05:36.351
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Ow!

05:36.385 --> 05:37.419
Ma, what're you doing?

05:37.452 --> 05:39.288
This is not how
I raised my sons.

05:39.321 --> 05:40.389
Mother, I was trying to stop...

05:43.225 --> 05:45.994
- Oh, so, you think this is funny, huh?
- Yeah. I do.

05:46.028 --> 05:47.828
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

05:50.065 --> 05:51.199
Where are your fish,
Abba?

05:51.233 --> 05:53.235
Malachi, not now.

05:53.268 --> 05:55.370
But why are your nets
so empty?

05:55.404 --> 05:57.439
Because they're thieves.

05:57.472 --> 05:59.174
The thieves
of Galilee,

05:59.207 --> 06:00.976
they stole my fish.

06:09.117 --> 06:10.085
What is wrong with you?

06:13.021 --> 06:13.821
Nothing.

06:16.024 --> 06:16.824
Nothing?

06:17.292 --> 06:18.527
Nothing.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.029
You call fist-fights
nothing?

06:21.063 --> 06:23.398
You call lashing out
on everyone around you,

06:23.432 --> 06:24.633
including your wife,
nothing?

06:24.666 --> 06:26.568
- I'm not lashing out.
- You are right now!

06:30.238 --> 06:31.340
We're drowning, Peter.

06:35.943 --> 06:37.612
We're fine.

06:37.646 --> 06:39.381
I'll get these nets
back in order,

06:39.414 --> 06:42.084
and in the morning,
I'll bring you back a net full of fish.

06:42.117 --> 06:43.851
- You watch.
- It's not about the fish.

06:45.354 --> 06:47.155
Not about the fish, Rachel?

06:47.756 --> 06:50.359
We sing songs about it.

06:50.392 --> 06:52.594
"A net full of fish
makes you king of the dock."

06:57.632 --> 07:00.402
More fish means
more money. Hmm?

07:00.435 --> 07:02.504
- And more money means that...
- What?

07:06.208 --> 07:07.042
It means what?

07:09.578 --> 07:11.613
Food on our table?

07:11.646 --> 07:14.349
Clothes on our back,
or another boat?

07:14.383 --> 07:16.051
Those things matter,
but, Peter...

07:16.084 --> 07:17.586
It means
I'm worth something.

07:24.192 --> 07:27.596
What matters
the most to me

07:27.629 --> 07:29.930
is how full
these nets are.

07:38.140 --> 07:39.541
I need to get back
to work.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.282
We'll help you untie
those knots.

07:47.315 --> 07:48.583
No, I can do it
on my own.

07:48.617 --> 07:50.918
- But I want to help, Papa.
- I don't need anyone's help!

07:53.655 --> 07:54.689
Rachel.

07:56.124 --> 07:57.526
Malachi.

07:57.559 --> 08:00.228
Let us know
when we matter.

08:07.335 --> 08:10.238
What, are you gonna squawk at
me, too?

08:10.272 --> 08:12.207
Huh?

08:18.280 --> 08:19.381
Of course.

08:48.743 --> 08:50.679
You're going
to give him your coat?

08:50.712 --> 08:51.746
Uh...

08:53.381 --> 08:54.349
Have you seen his hat?

08:55.283 --> 08:56.384
I gave him
more than that.

08:56.418 --> 08:59.020
Do I know you? Huh?

09:00.322 --> 09:03.992
And why are you standing
in my boat?

09:05.560 --> 09:06.728
Your net is empty, Peter.

09:06.761 --> 09:10.532
Oh, that is very
observant of you.

09:10.565 --> 09:12.267
You must be a prophet.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.736
It's empty
even when it's full of fish.

09:16.571 --> 09:17.806
That means you're ready.

09:17.839 --> 09:20.575
Hey. What are you...

09:20.609 --> 09:22.644
What do you mean,
I'm ready? Ready for what?

09:23.345 --> 09:25.680
Let's go out
into the deep.

09:25.714 --> 09:26.781
The deep.

09:26.815 --> 09:28.650
Look, Teacher.

09:28.683 --> 09:32.220
I don't know who you are
or how you think you know me,

09:32.254 --> 09:34.289
but if you don't mind,

09:34.322 --> 09:38.126
I need to figure this out
on my own.

09:38.159 --> 09:39.561
The boat is sailing,
son of John.

09:40.095 --> 09:41.663
You're gonna miss it.

09:41.696 --> 09:42.697
Peter, what's
he doing in our boat?

09:42.731 --> 09:44.199
Hey!

09:44.232 --> 09:45.634
Hey, look.
Peter's back at it again!

09:45.667 --> 09:48.637
Oh, I gotta see this.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.639
Hey, Pete.
While we're out there,

09:50.672 --> 09:52.507
maybe you can catch
my missing sandal.

09:53.775 --> 09:56.478
Peter!
Where are you going?

09:56.511 --> 09:58.513
- I don't know.
- And who is that with him?

10:01.116 --> 10:02.117
Are you ready, Peter?

10:02.651 --> 10:03.752
Sure.

10:07.656 --> 10:08.657
Row.

10:10.592 --> 10:12.127
Row.

10:26.374 --> 10:27.175
We're here.

10:28.643 --> 10:30.679
Here?

10:30.712 --> 10:34.683
I just spent three hours
in this exact place.

10:34.716 --> 10:36.351
It's an empty sea.

10:37.752 --> 10:39.254
That's not exactly true.

10:40.355 --> 10:41.389
Throw your net, Peter.

10:42.757 --> 10:44.626
Um, on the right side
of the boat.

10:44.659 --> 10:47.896
Oh, on the right side?

10:47.929 --> 10:50.198
You don't do a lot
of fishing, do you?

10:50.699 --> 10:52.167
No.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.636
So, uh,
what do you do?

10:54.669 --> 10:57.706
- Carpentry.
- Really?

10:57.739 --> 10:59.341
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

11:00.141 --> 11:01.676
You never did know
when to quit.

11:22.664 --> 11:24.000
Look.

11:24.033 --> 11:27.535
If you're trying to completely
humiliate me, then it's working.

11:30.839 --> 11:32.874
Hold on, ol' Peter!

11:40.749 --> 11:42.550
It's just another day
at sea

11:42.584 --> 11:44.586
for the boys of Galilee!

11:44.619 --> 11:46.521
I've never seen
anything like this!

11:46.554 --> 11:48.256
Andrew, are you gonna start
dancing or help me out here?

12:10.612 --> 12:12.781
Yeah! Yeah!

12:12.814 --> 12:14.282
Carpenter.

12:15.817 --> 12:17.552
I don't know who you are,

12:17.585 --> 12:19.954
but you must leave me
at once.

12:22.390 --> 12:24.426
I'm just a fisherman
from Galilee...

12:25.293 --> 12:28.963
a sinner, unworthy to be
in your presence.

12:28.998 --> 12:29.931
Peter.

12:32.600 --> 12:33.468
Follow me.

12:34.569 --> 12:36.204
And I will make you
a fisher of men.

12:37.472 --> 12:40.241
Andrew, follow me.

12:40.642 --> 12:41.977
James, John.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.345
Sons of thunder,
follow me!

12:44.379 --> 12:46.681
- Yes, I will.
- Me, too!

12:46.715 --> 12:48.950
Peter.
Our net is so full.

12:49.284 --> 12:51.486
Yes, it is.

12:51.519 --> 12:53.254
- He's the king of the dock!
- Andrew.

12:54.056 --> 12:56.324
I think
he's more than that.

12:56.357 --> 12:57.559
Yeah!

13:08.937 --> 13:10.605
How are you
doing that?

13:10.638 --> 13:12.707
I don't know.
The food just keeps coming.

13:12.741 --> 13:14.409
And so do the people.

13:14.442 --> 13:15.810
Look...

13:15.844 --> 13:17.278
That's the boy!

13:17.312 --> 13:18.847
The boy
with the miracle basket.

14:04.526 --> 14:06.262
Jesus did this, Papa.

14:08.663 --> 14:10.532
We don't need anymore.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.835
Everyone has
more than enough.

14:18.773 --> 14:20.042
Please.

14:20.075 --> 14:22.744
Please don't disturb
the teacher.

14:25.047 --> 14:27.116
Whoa, whoa!
Hey. I knew this would happen.

14:27.149 --> 14:28.650
Parents, please!

14:28.683 --> 14:31.053
Let the children come.

14:31.086 --> 14:33.721
Don't ignore any
of these little ones.

14:33.755 --> 14:36.391
Unless you become
like these little children,

14:36.424 --> 14:38.827
humble and full of faith,

14:38.860 --> 14:42.664
faith even as small as the
seed of a mustard flower,

14:42.697 --> 14:45.700
you can never come into the
Kingdom of Heaven.

14:45.733 --> 14:48.570
The spirit of the Lord
is upon me.

14:48.603 --> 14:50.939
The Father has sent me
to bring good news to you.

14:50.972 --> 14:52.841
To heal the brokenhearted.

14:52.874 --> 14:55.810
To tell you all that the
captives will be set free,

14:55.844 --> 14:57.512
the blind will see,

14:57.545 --> 14:59.514
the lame walk

14:59.547 --> 15:01.583
and the hurting
will be rescued.

15:02.750 --> 15:05.486
Oh! Thank you.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.622
Children,
look at these flowers.

15:07.655 --> 15:09.091
They don't make
their clothing,

15:09.124 --> 15:10.925
yet even
the great King Solomon

15:10.959 --> 15:13.561
was not dressed
as beautifully as they are.

15:14.662 --> 15:16.931
So, if God cares
so much for flowers

15:16.965 --> 15:19.901
that are here today
and gone tomorrow,

15:19.934 --> 15:22.071
don't you think
he cares for you, too?

15:22.104 --> 15:23.138
Yes!

15:23.172 --> 15:24.873
Oh, and look!

15:24.906 --> 15:26.507
Look at these birds!

15:26.541 --> 15:29.111
Look at how the Father
has provided for them.

15:32.982 --> 15:34.149
Why should you worry

15:34.183 --> 15:36.417
about what to eat and drink?

15:36.451 --> 15:39.188
Your Father
already knows your needs.

15:39.221 --> 15:42.523
Seek the heart of God
above everything else,

15:42.557 --> 15:45.060
and he will gladly give you
what you need.

15:45.094 --> 15:46.895
What is the heart of God?

15:48.230 --> 15:50.565
What is the heart of God?

15:50.598 --> 15:52.134
Have you ever heard
the story of the lost son?

15:53.534 --> 15:54.969
- No.
- No?

15:55.004 --> 15:56.938
Would you children
like to hear a story?

15:56.971 --> 15:58.406
- Yes!
- All right.

16:02.744 --> 16:03.811
Well...

16:04.946 --> 16:07.448
there was a kind
and wealthy farmer

16:07.482 --> 16:10.585
who had two sons
that he loved very much.

16:10.618 --> 16:13.122
He poured his life
into them.

16:13.155 --> 16:15.623
Well, these two boys were very
different from each other.

16:15.657 --> 16:18.693
The older son never cared
about life beyond the farm.

16:18.726 --> 16:21.562
He was satisfied
working his father's land

16:21.596 --> 16:24.532
and he looked forward to the day
when his own sons might take it over.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.236
But not so
with the youngest.

16:27.269 --> 16:30.239
He wanted nothing more
than to go into the world

16:30.272 --> 16:32.640
and indulge in everything
it had to offer.

16:34.742 --> 16:37.745
Why won't you
just let me go?

16:37.779 --> 16:40.648
There will be a day when you can
make that decision for yourself.

16:40.682 --> 16:43.551
But I love you, my son,
and I want what's best for you.

16:44.852 --> 16:45.820
Do you trust me?

16:46.155 --> 16:47.222
What?

16:47.256 --> 16:49.058
Dark thoughts crept
into his heart.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.827
He started to question
if he could trust his father.

16:53.962 --> 16:55.697
If he truly loves me,

16:56.764 --> 16:58.499
then he'll give me
what I want.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.204
So, the younger son
made up his mind

17:02.237 --> 17:05.707
and asked his father for his
share of the family wealth.

17:05.740 --> 17:07.608
Though his heart
was breaking,

17:07.642 --> 17:09.111
the father relented.

17:09.144 --> 17:11.046
He gave his son the money

17:11.079 --> 17:14.882
and watched this willful boy
set out on his own.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.118
Come home soon.

17:18.087 --> 17:19.954
This is goodbye, Father.

17:22.890 --> 17:24.993
He actually left.

17:25.027 --> 17:26.060
I can't believe it.

17:26.996 --> 17:28.763
I knew this day would come.

17:28.796 --> 17:29.931
Do you think
he'll ever come back?

17:31.333 --> 17:32.800
I'll always be waiting.

17:34.203 --> 17:35.937
Time passed.

17:35.970 --> 17:37.239
Weeks turned into months,

17:37.272 --> 17:39.540
and months turned
into seasons.

17:40.742 --> 17:42.844
Life on the farm
continued as normal.

17:42.877 --> 17:45.747
However, the father had not
heard from his youngest son

17:45.780 --> 17:47.082
since the day he left.

17:48.217 --> 17:51.753
The father longed
to hold him in his arms

17:51.786 --> 17:54.089
and protect him like he did
when he was just a boy.

17:55.224 --> 17:57.592
But his son had
to choose.

17:57.625 --> 17:59.294
And all the father could do
was watch...

18:00.229 --> 18:01.629
and wait.

18:03.265 --> 18:06.801
Sadly, the thing the father
feared most came true.

18:06.834 --> 18:09.570
His son spent
all of his inheritance

18:09.604 --> 18:12.640
on reckless living
and could barely get by.

18:12.673 --> 18:15.310
And about this time,
a severe famine hit the land.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.182
Now, penniless

18:20.882 --> 18:22.884
and homeless,

18:22.917 --> 18:25.653
he went and hired himself out
to a local pig farmer.

18:28.790 --> 18:31.026
As he sat out
among the swine,

18:31.060 --> 18:33.828
his empty stomach groaned.

18:33.861 --> 18:36.597
He scrounged through
the mud for scraps of food,

18:36.631 --> 18:38.300
fighting the pigs
for anything edible.

18:39.967 --> 18:42.004
It was at this moment

18:42.037 --> 18:44.605
he realized
how far he had fallen.

18:45.740 --> 18:48.143
What has become of me?

18:48.177 --> 18:51.612
Even my father's
servants have shelter

18:51.646 --> 18:53.148
and more than enough food.

18:54.849 --> 18:56.285
Look at me.

18:56.318 --> 18:57.919
Look at me.

18:59.321 --> 19:00.655
Look at me!

19:02.191 --> 19:03.691
I miss my father.

19:05.294 --> 19:06.894
I miss you, Father.

19:08.663 --> 19:11.833
So the young man
arose from his filth,

19:12.600 --> 19:15.736
and he began
his long journey home.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.341
Weak,

19:20.075 --> 19:22.877
barefoot and broken,

19:22.910 --> 19:26.081
he came within sight
of the old homestead.

19:26.115 --> 19:28.383
And while he was still
a long way off,

19:28.417 --> 19:30.152
his father saw him.

19:31.819 --> 19:32.820
My son?

19:34.123 --> 19:36.024
- My son!
- Father.

19:36.058 --> 19:37.625
- My son!
- Father!

19:39.760 --> 19:41.130
I have sinned

19:41.163 --> 19:44.032
against God
and against you.

19:44.066 --> 19:47.735
I am no longer worthy to be
called your son.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.039
But you are my son.

19:52.074 --> 19:54.042
Nothing will
ever change that.

19:54.076 --> 19:55.843
I love you.

19:55.877 --> 19:57.845
And I love you.

19:57.879 --> 20:00.315
Now, I will give you
my best coat

20:00.349 --> 20:03.318
and put it on you,
and take my ring and put it on your hand,

20:03.352 --> 20:04.919
and put shoes on your feet.

20:04.952 --> 20:06.989
We will have a feast
and celebrate!

20:09.458 --> 20:11.759
For you were dead,
but now you are alive.

20:12.927 --> 20:14.962
You were lost,
but now you are found.

20:15.998 --> 20:18.100
You are safely home,
my son.

20:19.401 --> 20:20.801
Oman!

20:20.835 --> 20:22.271
- Oman!
- Yes, master?

20:22.304 --> 20:23.905
Kill the fattened calf.

20:25.806 --> 20:28.809
My son is home.

20:29.044 --> 20:30.179
Yes!

20:30.912 --> 20:32.080
Yes!

20:32.947 --> 20:34.316
Praise God.

20:35.850 --> 20:37.486
My friends.

20:37.519 --> 20:39.954
That is the heart
of your heavenly Father.

20:41.190 --> 20:43.891
Teacher,
how should we pray to Him?

20:43.925 --> 20:45.394
- Please teach us.
- Yes, master.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.795
When you pray to your Abba,

20:48.297 --> 20:49.364
your Father...

20:50.831 --> 20:51.433
pray like this.

20:54.036 --> 20:55.803
Our Father in heaven,

20:57.039 --> 20:58.739
may your name be kept holy.

20:59.274 --> 21:00.808
May your kingdom come

21:00.841 --> 21:03.178
and your will be done
on Earth,

21:03.212 --> 21:04.279
as it is in heaven.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.482
Give us what we need today

21:07.516 --> 21:10.419
and forgive us of our sins,
as we have forgiven those

21:10.452 --> 21:11.453
who have sinned against us.

21:12.820 --> 21:14.389
And don't let us give
into temptation.

21:14.423 --> 21:16.291
But rescue us
from the evil one.

21:17.426 --> 21:19.328
For yours is the kingdom

21:19.961 --> 21:21.929
and the power and the glory...

21:23.065 --> 21:24.066
forever.

21:25.133 --> 21:26.301
Amen.

21:26.335 --> 21:28.003
- Amen.
- Amen.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.770
- Amen!
- You agree, then?

21:29.804 --> 21:31.106
Yes.

21:31.139 --> 21:33.275
I must go and bring
this good news to others.

21:33.308 --> 21:34.476
Blessings to all of you.

21:34.509 --> 21:37.546
And remember, if you have ears to
hear, let them hear.

21:37.579 --> 21:40.182
If you have eyes to see,
let them see.

21:46.188 --> 21:48.323
Jesus. Jesus.

21:48.357 --> 21:50.392
If we want to get to Jerusalem
in time for the Passover,

21:50.425 --> 21:51.792
we need to be
on our way.

21:51.826 --> 21:54.563
Yes. Judas always
thinking ahead.

21:54.596 --> 21:56.265
But first I'd like
to stop at Martha's house

21:56.298 --> 21:57.499
before we get
into Jerusalem.

21:57.532 --> 21:59.468
Ha! I was hoping
he would say that.

21:59.501 --> 22:02.070
Why? Because Martha
is a better cook than Rachel?

22:02.104 --> 22:04.239
- I never said that.
- No!

22:04.273 --> 22:05.173
But you meant it.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.511
Hi, my love.

22:09.544 --> 22:11.313
Oh, how sweet!

22:11.346 --> 22:13.315
Look at them, Rachel.
They're like new men.

22:13.348 --> 22:14.383
I haven't even
seen them fight

22:14.416 --> 22:16.351
since they started
following Jesus.

22:16.385 --> 22:18.520
Because they stopped
fighting themselves.

22:20.055 --> 22:21.123
Leper!

22:21.156 --> 22:22.491
Leper, go.

22:22.524 --> 22:23.358
Unclean.

22:25.027 --> 22:26.961
- Unclean.
- It's a leper.

22:26.995 --> 22:28.230
Everyone, clear away!

22:28.263 --> 22:29.864
- Get back!
- Get Jesus away from him.

22:29.897 --> 22:31.266
- Master, let's go this way.
- No!

22:31.300 --> 22:32.434
Master, don't.

22:32.467 --> 22:33.602
I can't let you
touch him.

22:33.635 --> 22:35.037
His disease
is a death sentence.

22:36.204 --> 22:37.205
What is your name?

22:38.106 --> 22:39.441
Unclean.

22:41.043 --> 22:44.246
But if you are willing,

22:44.279 --> 22:46.148
you can make me
clean again.

22:46.181 --> 22:47.149
What? No.

22:47.182 --> 22:48.849
Master, stay back.

22:48.883 --> 22:50.252
- Jesus, do not touch him.
- John.

22:50.285 --> 22:52.054
- John!
- No!

22:52.087 --> 22:53.588
Don't touch him!

22:58.627 --> 23:00.961
Your faith
has made you clean.

23:14.543 --> 23:15.544
Ah.

23:16.111 --> 23:16.911
Ah!

23:17.279 --> 23:18.280
My face?

23:19.581 --> 23:21.049
Am I healed?

23:31.159 --> 23:32.494
Praise be to God.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.331
Praise be to God.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.967
Praise be to God.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.873
Praise be to God!

23:48.043 --> 23:51.213
Praise be to God!

23:51.246 --> 23:52.880
- Master, you just...
- I did.

23:54.282 --> 23:56.151
- Yeah, but he was a...
- He was.

24:01.022 --> 24:02.224
John.

24:04.559 --> 24:05.926
Sing the Passover song.

24:08.997 --> 24:10.399
Okay.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.235
Let's go
to Jerusalem.

24:17.739 --> 24:20.442

25:43.425 --> 25:46.328
Young lady, Jerusalem
is in that direction.

25:46.361 --> 25:49.130
I'm not going to Jerusalem.
I'm looking for someone.

25:49.164 --> 25:51.333
The only one you should be
seeking right now is God.

25:51.366 --> 25:54.636
And he's not behind us.
He's ahead in Jerusalem.

25:56.538 --> 25:58.039
Mary?

25:58.073 --> 26:00.308
Mary? Where were you?

26:00.342 --> 26:02.511
Jesus and the boys
will be here any minute.

26:02.544 --> 26:03.812
And I'm still making mutton.

26:03.845 --> 26:05.547
- They're here.
- Already?

26:07.849 --> 26:08.783
Amah!

26:12.287 --> 26:13.321
Rachel.

26:14.689 --> 26:15.757
Mother Mary.

26:17.425 --> 26:19.294
Well, we came on ahead.

26:19.327 --> 26:20.829
The boys will be here soon.

26:20.862 --> 26:23.632
Mary, can you help me
with this food?

26:23.665 --> 26:25.400
You stay here.
I'll help Martha.

26:26.301 --> 26:29.070
Oh, I'm so excited
to hear the latest news.

26:29.104 --> 26:31.106
- What's been happening?
- Where do we begin?

26:31.139 --> 26:34.409
He just fed 5,000 men,
plus the women and children

26:34.442 --> 26:36.211
with five loaves
of bread and two fish,

26:36.244 --> 26:38.346
healed a leper,
raised a child from the dead

26:38.380 --> 26:41.249
and delivered this Magdalean
woman here from seven demons.

26:41.550 --> 26:42.684
Say, hi.

26:44.519 --> 26:45.787
Hi.

26:46.588 --> 26:48.823
My name is Mary.
What's your name?

26:50.492 --> 26:52.594
- Mary.
- Mary!

26:52.627 --> 26:54.462
Help Mother Mary
with the food.

26:55.297 --> 26:56.364
Who is she?

26:58.233 --> 26:59.734
Mary.

26:59.768 --> 27:02.070
Another one?

27:03.538 --> 27:06.074
Well, let's all eat, drink
and, uh, be merry.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.810
Mama. Where's Lazarus?

27:08.843 --> 27:10.812
I'm sure he's
around here somewhere,

27:10.845 --> 27:13.848
but before you run off,
you need to wash your hands.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.686
- Lazarus.
- Malachi!

27:17.719 --> 27:20.822
That boy
doesn't sit still for a minute.

27:20.855 --> 27:22.824
He's just
like his father.

27:22.857 --> 27:24.893
That's just the way
John was,

27:24.926 --> 27:27.429
always off on some adventure.

27:27.462 --> 27:28.863
But, oh, what a sweet boy,

27:29.764 --> 27:31.700
just the opposite
of James.

27:31.733 --> 27:32.767
How so?

27:32.801 --> 27:34.669
Mr. know-it-all,
that one.

27:34.703 --> 27:37.238
Always had an answer
for everything.

27:37.272 --> 27:39.341
I wore my belt out on his behind.

27:41.176 --> 27:43.478
I bet Jesus never
gave you any trouble, Mary.

27:44.679 --> 27:46.715
What was that?

27:46.748 --> 27:48.450
That means
there was something!

27:48.483 --> 27:50.352
There had
to be something. Tell us.

27:50.385 --> 27:51.720
Come on. You have
to tell us everything.

27:52.287 --> 27:54.389
Well,

27:54.422 --> 27:57.525
when Jesus was
about Malachi's age,

27:57.559 --> 28:01.763
we were traveling back with the
caravan from Jerusalem after Passover.

28:01.796 --> 28:03.732
And I assumed
he was with Joseph,

28:03.765 --> 28:06.267
and Joseph assumed
he was with me.

28:06.301 --> 28:08.236
So, you can imagine
how shocked we were

28:08.269 --> 28:10.538
when we realized
he wasn't with either of us.

28:10.572 --> 28:12.907
I would've
ripped into him.

28:14.843 --> 28:16.511
Where was he?

28:16.544 --> 28:19.681
Oh, we finally found him three
days later back in Jerusalem.

28:20.715 --> 28:22.350
- Jerusalem?
- Jerusalem?

28:22.384 --> 28:24.886
And he never told you
or Joseph he was going back?

28:24.919 --> 28:26.821
Oh, I would've ripped
into him.

28:26.855 --> 28:30.492
He was at the
temple teaching the rabbis.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.729
God instructed Moses

28:34.763 --> 28:36.564
to put the blood
of their lambs

28:36.598 --> 28:39.200
over the doorways
of their homes

28:39.234 --> 28:40.902
so that death can pass
over them.

28:40.935 --> 28:44.305
Yes, for the covering
of our sins.

28:44.339 --> 28:46.908
But if the blood
of the Passover lamb

28:46.941 --> 28:49.411
forgives the sins
of the people,

28:49.444 --> 28:51.846
why must we sacrifice it
every year?

28:51.880 --> 28:54.249
The Passover lamb
must be sacrificed every year

28:54.282 --> 28:56.951
because there is no
permanent cure for man's sin.

28:56.986 --> 29:00.522
Therefore we must always
provide a lamb to be slain,

29:00.555 --> 29:02.223
just as the law requires.

29:02.257 --> 29:05.527
Have you forgotten
that God told Abraham,

29:05.560 --> 29:08.229
"I will provide the lamb,"

29:08.263 --> 29:12.367
and through him, all the nations
of the Earth will be blessed?

29:12.400 --> 29:14.436
This boy speaks
with authority and wisdom.

29:14.469 --> 29:16.471
Oh, you're speaking
of the messiah.

29:16.504 --> 29:17.739
Yes.

29:17.772 --> 29:19.974
Our messiah will come
as a warrior,

29:20.009 --> 29:21.776
conquering the nations

29:21.810 --> 29:24.212
and restoring glory
to Israel.

29:24.612 --> 29:26.281
No.

29:26.314 --> 29:28.950
He will come as God's lamb
to be sacrificed.

29:28.984 --> 29:31.286
His blood will break
the power of sin

29:31.319 --> 29:33.254
that separates man
from God,

29:34.322 --> 29:35.390
once and for all.

29:35.423 --> 29:36.825
Amazing!

29:36.858 --> 29:39.828
How does this boy
speak like this?

29:39.861 --> 29:41.997
It sounds
as if you know him.

29:43.598 --> 29:45.266
Tell me, boy.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.702
If you know so much
about the messiah,

29:48.470 --> 29:49.704
who is he?

29:50.672 --> 29:52.974
Jesus! Oh!

29:53.008 --> 29:55.443
They were amazed by him.

29:56.911 --> 29:59.948
But Joseph and I
were too upset to care.

29:59.982 --> 30:02.484
We scolded him right there
in front of the Pharisees.

30:03.852 --> 30:05.320
What did he do?

30:06.488 --> 30:09.491
He just looked up at me
and said...

30:09.524 --> 30:10.993
"Didn't you know
I'd be in my Father's house?"

30:20.702 --> 30:22.004
That's it?

30:23.905 --> 30:25.040
That's all he said?

30:26.474 --> 30:29.044
Well
I'll tell you one thing.

30:29.078 --> 30:31.880
If that were James or John,
I would've grabbed them by the ears

30:31.913 --> 30:33.314
and whooped
their little behinds.

30:35.450 --> 30:37.852
Especially
if it were James.

30:37.886 --> 30:40.922
Mmm-hmm. I would've
gathered the entire caravan

30:40.955 --> 30:42.590
and made him do
a public apology

30:42.624 --> 30:44.726
for turning my hair gray

30:44.759 --> 30:47.462
and making his father go bald.

30:47.495 --> 30:49.031
Yes, ma'am.
Listen.

30:49.064 --> 30:51.766
I would've even made him
apologize to the donkey.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.802
For having to walk
all the way back to Jerusalem.

30:53.835 --> 30:55.370
And then what?

30:55.403 --> 30:57.505
Then I would've
told that little boy Jesus...

30:57.539 --> 30:58.840
What, Amah?

31:03.045 --> 31:05.346
That God chose the right
woman to be your mother.

31:07.082 --> 31:08.516
- That he did.
- Help me down.

31:09.484 --> 31:10.485
Amah.

31:11.753 --> 31:12.787
Mother.

31:14.923 --> 31:16.491
Martha, my home away from home.

31:16.524 --> 31:18.493
Jesus. Oh!

31:18.526 --> 31:20.728
You are skin and bones.
Now, come.

31:20.762 --> 31:22.031
Sit. I just made fig cakes.

31:22.064 --> 31:23.565
Mary, go get
the fig cakes.

31:23.598 --> 31:24.532
We can't stay for long.

31:24.566 --> 31:26.868
Peter is keeping us
on a very tight schedule.

31:26.901 --> 31:29.071
Hey! Get out
of my kitchen.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.839
You are all like
a pack of jackals!

31:30.872 --> 31:32.674
Now, there is more
in the oven.

31:32.707 --> 31:33.942
Get out, James.

32:12.447 --> 32:13.748
Mary?

32:13.781 --> 32:16.384
Now, Mary, I just
asked you to go get the...

32:19.221 --> 32:20.622
Jesus.

32:20.655 --> 32:21.789
Don't you think it's unfair

32:21.823 --> 32:25.027
that my sister just sits there
while I do all the work?

32:25.060 --> 32:26.394
Tell her to come
and help me.

32:28.030 --> 32:29.497
Martha...

32:30.431 --> 32:32.867
there is only one thing
worth being concerned about...

32:33.935 --> 32:35.403
and Mary has found it.

32:38.473 --> 32:39.841
And it will not be
taken away from her.

32:43.478 --> 32:45.780
Besides,
I never really liked your cooking.

32:46.881 --> 32:49.751
- I love it!
- Jesus!

32:49.784 --> 32:52.687
- Jesus!
- There he is! Lazarus!

32:52.720 --> 32:55.190
- Hey. You've gotten taller.
- And stronger.

32:55.224 --> 32:57.092
What has Martha
been feeding you?

32:57.126 --> 32:59.228
What hasn't she
been feeding him.

32:59.261 --> 33:01.096
Lazarus, come with us
to Jerusalem,

33:01.130 --> 33:02.164
if it's all right
with your sisters.

33:02.197 --> 33:04.632
All right?
Oh, please, get him out of here.

33:04.666 --> 33:07.202
You know, every day his
friends from the city come,

33:07.236 --> 33:08.937
and guess who has
to feed them? Me.

33:08.970 --> 33:11.140
Hey, go raid their
cupboards for once,

33:11.173 --> 33:12.840
and then come back here
and rest!

33:12.874 --> 33:14.776
All right! We need
to be on our way.

33:14.809 --> 33:16.211
- Be safe!
- Goodbye, Mary.

33:17.212 --> 33:18.446
Goodbye!

Don't go
near that man, Sarah.

33:54.582 --> 33:58.486
He was born blind.
God's curse is on him.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.222
All right, Mama.

34:03.591 --> 34:04.492
Teacher...

34:06.095 --> 34:08.730
why was this man
born blind?

34:08.763 --> 34:11.498
Was it because of his own
sins or his parents' sins?

34:11.766 --> 34:13.768
Neither.

34:13.801 --> 34:17.638
This happened so that the power
of God could be seen in him.

34:17.672 --> 34:21.542
This man lives in darkness, but
today, Judas, he will see the light.

34:22.844 --> 34:26.748
Shekel? Have mercy.
Just one shekel, sir?

34:41.196 --> 34:42.764
It looks like
he's making mud.

34:50.804 --> 34:52.274
No.
What are you doing?

34:56.643 --> 35:00.182
Please, please
don't shame me more, please.

35:01.916 --> 35:03.352
Now go,

35:03.385 --> 35:05.586
and wash yourself
in the Pool of Siloam.

35:06.121 --> 35:07.322
The healing pool?

35:07.622 --> 35:08.823
Yes.

35:10.691 --> 35:12.560
You're smiling.

35:13.062 --> 35:15.097
- I am.
- Yes.

35:15.130 --> 35:16.331
Yes, I will go to the pool.

35:19.301 --> 35:20.568
Thank you.

35:23.838 --> 35:25.240
What is your name?

35:26.308 --> 35:27.309
Jesus.

35:28.010 --> 35:29.577
Jesus.

Jesus.

Jesus.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.320
Teacher,

35:39.021 --> 35:41.156
why did you put mud
on his eyes?

35:42.291 --> 35:44.359
Because, Nathanael,

35:44.393 --> 35:45.994
sometimes things have
to get messier

35:46.028 --> 35:47.595
before they can be
truly clean.

usual this year.

36:21.396 --> 36:23.865
Two doves

No blemish! No blemish!

Imported sacrificial knives

Head coverings!
Buy now, get another one at half!

36:31.839 --> 36:34.343
This one was touched
and blessed by the Sanhedrin.

36:34.376 --> 36:37.678
This one was touched by Caiaphas himself!
It's anointed. You buy?

36:37.712 --> 36:41.682
Master. Do we buy our Passover
sacrifices here or should we wait?

36:41.716 --> 36:43.252
You need to buy it here!
Buy now!

36:45.287 --> 36:48.290
My Passover lambs'
feet have never touched the ground.

36:48.323 --> 36:50.758
A perfect sacrifice
sure to please Jehovah.

36:50.791 --> 36:53.462
Wrapped in swaddling cloth
from Bethlehem.

36:53.495 --> 36:55.430
Can you believe
that over one million people

36:55.464 --> 36:57.698
come here
for these three days?

36:57.732 --> 36:59.001
Oh, yes, I can.

36:59.034 --> 37:01.170
Of course they would
be selling phylacteries here.

37:01.203 --> 37:03.071
Now why didn't I think
of that?

37:03.105 --> 37:05.706
- They must be making a killing.
- They do.

37:08.743 --> 37:10.379
You despicable little brat!

37:10.412 --> 37:11.746
Let me go!
Let me go!

37:17.286 --> 37:18.153
Hey!

37:20.088 --> 37:22.224
You're going to pay
for that shofar!

37:22.257 --> 37:25.793
The Scriptures declare, "My temple
will be called a house of prayer."

37:25.826 --> 37:26.727
Wait a minute.

37:29.797 --> 37:33.968
My temple will be called
a house of prayer!

37:34.002 --> 37:37.072
But you have turned it
into a den of thieves!

37:54.489 --> 37:57.825
This is my Father's house!

38:03.265 --> 38:05.434
This is my Father's house!

38:08.836 --> 38:11.206
No!
It cannot touch the ground!

38:13.008 --> 38:13.808
Get out!

38:16.478 --> 38:19.780
My Father does not want
your goats for sacrificing!

38:20.948 --> 38:23.252
He does not want
the blood of your bulls!

38:24.019 --> 38:27.055
What he wants is you.
He wants you.

38:35.830 --> 38:37.832
Where is your love
for the Father?

38:37.865 --> 38:38.766
You are insolent.

38:44.039 --> 38:45.540
- Stay back!
- Jesus.

38:45.574 --> 38:47.409
Get back.

38:47.442 --> 38:50.479
All right, brothers!
It's time to fight!

38:50.512 --> 38:51.580
That's not
what Jesus wants!

38:51.613 --> 38:55.150
This is it. This is Jesus
bringing God's kingdom.

38:55.183 --> 38:56.551
Let us fight with him!

38:56.585 --> 38:58.253
What, and die with him? No way!

38:58.287 --> 39:02.124
No! He doesn't want us
to fight. Not like this.

39:02.157 --> 39:03.325
Ahhh!

39:04.226 --> 39:05.027
Who did this?

39:06.995 --> 39:08.497
Who did this?

39:12.867 --> 39:14.902
You!

39:14.935 --> 39:18.839
You dare to disgrace
the temple of the Lord?

39:20.609 --> 39:21.543
You!

39:21.576 --> 39:24.912
Now there's room for
the blind and the sick.

39:28.116 --> 39:31.386
What?
Get out of here!

39:31.420 --> 39:34.022
- Peter, Peter.
- Where are the temple guards?

39:34.056 --> 39:35.090
- Run.
- Go after him.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.291
Keep him there, Malchus.

39:36.325 --> 39:37.825
Hey, you can't...

39:40.395 --> 39:43.031
Caiaphas,
your holiness.

39:43.065 --> 39:45.500
Caiaphas,
I can assure you,

39:45.534 --> 39:47.902
we will deal with the man
who did this.

39:48.570 --> 39:50.971
One man did all this?

39:51.006 --> 39:53.508
We pursued the vandal, sir,

39:53.542 --> 39:56.645
but lost him and his gang
of Galileans in the crowd.

39:56.678 --> 39:58.913
Here are some of the men
who were with him.

40:01.383 --> 40:04.885
I did not participate in this
rebellion, I can assure you.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.323
A fish out of water.

40:08.357 --> 40:12.427
You Galileans have
a certain smell about you.

40:12.461 --> 40:16.565
- We're not all Galileans, sir.
- No?

40:16.598 --> 40:17.632
What's your name?

40:18.667 --> 40:20.168
Judas Iscariot.

40:22.104 --> 40:25.906
I am a successful merchant who
has done a lot of business.

40:28.276 --> 40:29.678
Right here, actually.

40:29.711 --> 40:33.382
Judas. Please tell
those lowly net-casters

40:33.415 --> 40:35.450
that there are no fish here

40:35.484 --> 40:38.186
for them to draw into
their rebellious delusion.

40:38.220 --> 40:40.589
An empty sea.

40:40.622 --> 40:43.392
What did you say?

40:43.425 --> 40:45.093
It's what
we lowly fishermen call

40:46.094 --> 40:47.529
an empty sea.

40:53.335 --> 40:54.669
What is your name?

40:56.304 --> 40:57.439
Peter.

40:57.472 --> 40:58.673
- Peter.
- Yeah.

41:03.111 --> 41:07.182
I will have your leader caged
for what he has done.

41:07.215 --> 41:11.319
Tell him we will be watching and
to never enter God's house again.

41:12.687 --> 41:14.356
And a word of advice,
fisherman.

41:14.389 --> 41:17.025
Go back to your boat
and abandon this cause.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.561
Religion has no place
for someone like you.

41:22.097 --> 41:25.066
If this is what your religion is...

41:25.100 --> 41:26.967
then I have no place
for it.

41:29.538 --> 41:31.706
Judas,

41:31.740 --> 41:34.276
a wise merchant knows
when to cut his losses.

41:40.115 --> 41:42.050
Isn't this the beggar
from the gate?

41:42.083 --> 41:44.386
Well,
it looks like him,

41:44.419 --> 41:46.721
but it can't be.
He's blind.

41:46.755 --> 41:49.191
He was found at the Pool
of Siloam causing trouble,

41:49.224 --> 41:52.394
claiming Jesus of Nazareth
healed him of his blindness.

41:52.427 --> 41:54.663
- Who is Jesus of Nazareth?
- That's the man who did this.

41:55.664 --> 41:58.133
Some say he is a rabbi,

41:58.166 --> 42:02.103
but I heard he's merely
the son of a carpenter.

42:02.137 --> 42:04.005
You are the blind beggar,
aren't you?

42:04.039 --> 42:05.474
Yes, I am.

42:06.641 --> 42:07.709
Or I was.

42:11.613 --> 42:14.249
Yes, yes, you're Nicodemus.

42:14.282 --> 42:16.751
You've put many coins
in my cup over the years.

42:16.785 --> 42:18.720
How do we know this man
is telling the truth?

42:19.621 --> 42:21.623
I am his mother.

42:21.656 --> 42:25.527
I can testify that this is
my son and he was born blind.

42:25.560 --> 42:28.563
Yes, but how can he
now see?

42:28.597 --> 42:31.099
He is old enough to speak for himself.
Ask him.

42:31.132 --> 42:32.000
Enough!

42:38.106 --> 42:40.442
We will give God
the glory for this healing,

42:41.576 --> 42:43.211
but let there be no confusion.

42:43.245 --> 42:48.049
This Jesus is a sinner
who causes others to sin.

42:48.083 --> 42:50.385
I don't know whether
he is a sinner or not.

42:50.418 --> 42:52.087
But I do know this,

42:52.120 --> 42:55.123
I was blind,
and now I can see!

42:56.358 --> 42:58.293
I recognize your walk.

42:58.326 --> 43:01.062
Every day for years,
I've heard you walk right by me,

43:01.096 --> 43:04.533
but Jesus stopped
and saw me.

43:04.566 --> 43:06.468
How did he heal you?

43:06.501 --> 43:08.169
Ask the one
who sent him.

43:09.538 --> 43:12.707
And who do you believe
sent him?

43:15.110 --> 43:16.745
God.

43:16.778 --> 43:18.580
Heretic! Heretic!
This man is a heretic!

43:18.613 --> 43:19.748
Blasphemy!

43:21.349 --> 43:23.385
Clear this place now!

43:23.418 --> 43:25.353
Nicodemus!

43:25.387 --> 43:27.789
Gather your staff and get this
mess cleaned up before morning.

43:29.224 --> 43:31.159
It's going to be business
as usual.

43:52.914 --> 43:56.518
"And when he comes,
he will open the eyes of the blind...

43:58.553 --> 44:00.889
"and unplug
the ears of the deaf."

44:00.922 --> 44:03.191
"The lame
will leap like a deer,

44:03.224 --> 44:05.293
"and those who cannot speak
will sing for joy."

44:05.327 --> 44:06.194
Isaiah's prophecy.

44:07.329 --> 44:09.364
Could it be?

44:09.397 --> 44:11.866
In our lifetime, Joseph?

44:11.900 --> 44:14.102
It has to happen
in somebody's lifetime, Nic.

44:15.403 --> 44:16.605
Why not ours?

44:23.578 --> 44:24.713
Who do you think he is?

44:27.282 --> 44:29.384
A carpenter,

44:29.417 --> 44:32.387
who continues to fulfill every
prophecy written about the Messiah.

No one can do what you have
done unless God is with them.

46:02.944 --> 46:04.746
I do what my Father
tells me to do.

46:05.981 --> 46:07.449
Just like it's done in heaven.

46:08.450 --> 46:10.485
Your Father?

46:10.518 --> 46:13.955
But you're just the son of a
carpenter, from Nazareth,

46:14.956 --> 46:16.224
aren't you?

46:17.059 --> 46:18.827
Not entirely.

46:20.795 --> 46:22.864
What do you want,
Nicodemus?

46:25.400 --> 46:26.568
I want to see heaven.

46:27.736 --> 46:29.004
And you can.

46:29.838 --> 46:31.639
But first you must
be born again.

46:33.441 --> 46:36.711
How can a grown man
like me be born again?

46:37.946 --> 46:39.881
Do you feel that?

46:40.882 --> 46:43.618
You can hear the wind
rustling through the leaves,

46:43.651 --> 46:46.688
but you don't know where it
came from or where it's going.

46:46.721 --> 46:48.323
That is how the spirit
of God is.

46:50.925 --> 46:53.294
People can only reproduce
human life...

46:54.295 --> 46:57.332
but the spirit of God
gives birth to spiritual life.

46:58.900 --> 47:01.003
You were already born
in the flesh, Nicodemus,

47:01.036 --> 47:04.606
but in order to see heaven
you must be born again

47:04.639 --> 47:05.573
in His spirit.

47:07.076 --> 47:10.578
But I have done everything
by the law of Moses.

47:10.612 --> 47:12.413
I fear God.
I have been a student

47:12.447 --> 47:14.049
of the scriptures
since I was a child.

47:14.083 --> 47:16.484
Your salvation does not come
from anything that you do.

47:17.987 --> 47:19.654
It comes from
what you believe.

47:21.489 --> 47:23.025
Well, then,
help me understand.

47:25.527 --> 47:28.363
God loves the world,
Nicodemus.

47:29.664 --> 47:31.299
He wants his children back.

47:32.467 --> 47:33.635
All of them.

47:36.071 --> 47:38.940
Even those
who do not obey the law?

47:38.973 --> 47:41.342
- God is holy. He condemns sin.
- You're right.

47:42.710 --> 47:45.547
So there must be a sacrifice
that will pay for man's sin

47:45.580 --> 47:47.448
once and for all.

47:47.482 --> 47:51.419
There is no Passover lamb able to
cover man's sin once and for all.

47:52.320 --> 47:54.622
A sacrifice like that
would have to be perfect.

47:56.058 --> 47:57.358
Like God himself.

48:09.704 --> 48:10.939
Like God himself.

48:22.550 --> 48:24.786
Nicodemus!
What are you doing out here?

48:25.453 --> 48:26.989
Fresh air.

48:27.022 --> 48:29.657
It is rather stuffy
in there.

48:29.691 --> 48:32.427
Well, we've already met
with the Roman Commander

48:32.460 --> 48:34.863
and we have a plan
to trap this Nazarene.

48:34.896 --> 48:38.833
It seems this Jesus has been
causing trouble all over Israel.

48:38.867 --> 48:41.502
We are meeting again in a
few minutes at synagogue.

48:42.271 --> 48:45.140
We can expect you
to be there?

48:45.174 --> 48:46.841
Yes, of course.

48:48.743 --> 48:49.677
We must...

48:49.711 --> 48:52.014
We must, we must stop this,
this radical.

48:52.047 --> 48:53.882
Agreed.
And we will.

50:34.582 --> 50:37.952
Even the wind

stop, and it did.

50:42.924 --> 50:44.726
Who exactly is he?

50:44.759 --> 50:46.527
Look, I don't know,

50:46.561 --> 50:49.131
but the Pharisees in
Jerusalem call him an outlaw.

50:49.164 --> 50:51.166
Look,

50:51.200 --> 50:53.668
I don't think we can ever
show our faces there again.

50:53.701 --> 50:56.171
Why not?
He's a miracle worker.

50:56.205 --> 50:57.972
- A teacher.
- A healer, a prophet.

50:58.706 --> 50:59.907
A deliverer.

51:00.742 --> 51:02.111
Awake.

51:02.144 --> 51:05.180
Master, how much did you hear us say?

51:06.148 --> 51:08.283
I heard you talking about
the older brother.

51:08.816 --> 51:09.884
What do you mean?

51:10.752 --> 51:12.754
Remember the story I told

51:12.787 --> 51:16.058
about the wealthy farmer's son
who rebelled and ran away

51:16.091 --> 51:17.658
but then returned
to his father?

51:17.692 --> 51:18.926
- Yes.
- Of course.

51:18.960 --> 51:21.196
I never told you how
the older brother responded.

51:21.230 --> 51:22.730
Instead of rejoicing,

51:22.764 --> 51:24.632
he grew in jealousy
toward his little brother

51:24.665 --> 51:26.968
and bitterness
toward his father.

51:27.002 --> 51:30.039
He didn't want to accept that someone
who broke all the rules of sinful living

51:30.072 --> 51:33.008
should be welcomed back home
with such celebration.

51:34.243 --> 51:36.677
The Pharisees?

51:36.711 --> 51:38.646
If you have eyes to see,
John, then let them see.

51:40.182 --> 51:43.085
The Pharisees are acting
like the older brother.

51:43.118 --> 51:45.720
The rebel son
gets the fattened calf.

51:47.156 --> 51:48.689
You...

51:48.723 --> 51:51.592
You're suggesting that
Almighty God welcomes back

51:51.626 --> 51:54.129
any sinner no matter
what they've done?

51:54.163 --> 51:55.297
He does more than that, Judas.

51:56.365 --> 51:57.732
He goes after them.

51:58.800 --> 52:02.104
He's like a good shepherd
who has, say, 100 sheep.

52:03.738 --> 52:05.340
If one of them wandered off
and was lost...

52:07.042 --> 52:09.811
the shepherd would
leave the 99 others

52:09.844 --> 52:13.648
and go into the darkness
to search for that one.

52:14.882 --> 52:16.318
And when
the shepherd found it,

52:16.351 --> 52:19.388
he would rescue it,
embrace it

52:19.421 --> 52:21.789
and joyfully carry it
all the way home.

52:22.957 --> 52:24.126
And when he returns home,

52:24.159 --> 52:26.661
he will call together his
friends and his neighbors,

52:26.694 --> 52:28.863
saying, "Rejoice with me

52:28.896 --> 52:30.865
"because I have found
the one that was lost."

52:32.101 --> 52:34.702
In the same way,
there is more joy in heaven

52:34.735 --> 52:38.240
over one lost sinner who
repents and returns to God...

52:39.807 --> 52:43.011
than over 99 others
who don't need to repent.

52:49.084 --> 52:52.121
Um...
where exactly are we going?

52:53.322 --> 52:55.756
- Gadarenes.
- What?

52:56.458 --> 52:59.361
Gadarenes? No.

52:59.394 --> 53:01.230
No, this is the wrong side

53:01.263 --> 53:03.332
of the Galilee
for the Jews, Peter.

53:03.365 --> 53:05.700
It's full of pigs
and Gentiles.

53:05.733 --> 53:07.869
It's where the Master
wants us to go.

53:09.238 --> 53:10.172
- So we go.
- So we go.

53:10.205 --> 53:12.207
Are those graves?

53:12.241 --> 53:16.011
Gentiles, pigs
and the dead? Well, great!

53:16.044 --> 53:19.448
Let's just break all the laws
of Moses while we're at it!

53:19.481 --> 53:23.718
Hey, everyone! Let's drink a cup
of blood from a strangled goat!

53:24.819 --> 53:26.687
What are we doing here?

53:28.190 --> 53:29.724
Leaving the 99...

53:31.193 --> 53:32.227
to rescue the one.

53:38.233 --> 53:39.734
- To rescue the one?
- Yes.

53:40.801 --> 53:44.006
No. No, he leads us
across the sea,

53:44.039 --> 53:47.342
through a storm
that nearly drowns us

53:47.376 --> 53:50.345
to help some lunatic
in chains?

53:50.379 --> 53:52.114
We're not supposed
to be here.

53:52.147 --> 53:53.881
- You've already forgotten.

55:17.099 --> 55:20.868
Son of God,
do not bother us!

55:20.901 --> 55:23.572
You are Dorian, a child of
God, and he loves you.

55:23.605 --> 55:26.141
No, no.

55:26.174 --> 55:29.344
We beg you.
If you are going to cast us out,

55:29.378 --> 55:32.180
then send us
into that herd of pigs.

55:32.214 --> 55:34.849
Anywhere but
to the distant place!

55:34.882 --> 55:37.019
Dorian. Be free!

55:52.301 --> 55:54.469
- You! Get out of here!
- Stay back!

55:54.503 --> 55:55.870
He killed our pigs!

55:55.903 --> 55:57.572
He delivered this man
from devils.

55:57.606 --> 55:59.974
And delivered us
into poverty!

56:00.008 --> 56:03.145
You're not welcome here,
miracle worker.

56:03.178 --> 56:04.879
Put your swords away.
We'll leave.

56:11.553 --> 56:13.021
Deliverer.

56:14.289 --> 56:16.091
Healer.

56:16.124 --> 56:18.193
Where are you going?
Please, let me come with you.

56:18.226 --> 56:21.862
No, Dorian. Stay...

56:21.896 --> 56:24.232
and tell your people what
the Lord has done for you.

56:25.200 --> 56:27.602
They won't listen to me.
Not yet.

56:27.636 --> 56:29.338
But they will listen
to you.

56:31.039 --> 56:32.274
Dorian?

56:34.109 --> 56:35.010
Mother...

56:35.677 --> 56:36.578
You're back!

56:38.946 --> 56:41.316
I can see your eyes again.
What happened?

56:41.350 --> 56:44.186
<i>♪ He knew me by name</i>

56:45.087 --> 56:47.556
<i>♪ He called out in the night</i>

<i>♪ He saved me</i>

57:05.973 --> 57:11.179
<i>♪ And, oh
He came to save the one</i>

57:11.213 --> 57:13.448
<i>♪ To save this one</i>

57:13.482 --> 57:15.950
<i>♪ And, oh
He crossed the sea</i>

58:36.698 --> 58:38.233
You're quiet tonight,
Mary.

58:39.267 --> 58:40.469
Oh, Mom,

58:42.737 --> 58:45.674
it's strange being back
in my hometown.

58:48.076 --> 58:52.013
Well, you're certainly no
stranger to the streets of Magdala.

58:53.215 --> 58:54.516
I knew you'd come back.

58:55.484 --> 58:57.486
Who are you?
Leave her alone.

58:57.519 --> 59:00.755
- I know him, Amah.
- Yes.

59:02.257 --> 59:05.260
We go way back,
don't we, Mary?

59:07.062 --> 59:08.997
- Are you looking for work?
- That!

59:10.332 --> 59:13.068
That is not who I am anymore.
I have changed.

59:13.101 --> 59:14.102
Changed?

59:17.539 --> 59:21.243
Sure. You're just a different
kind of crazy, that's all.

59:24.179 --> 59:25.580
What are you writing?

59:26.648 --> 59:28.083
That.

59:28.817 --> 59:31.186
That is who Jesus
says I am!

59:31.219 --> 59:32.521
Jesus!

59:34.322 --> 59:36.691
Jesus
can't change you...

59:38.093 --> 59:40.629
or the things
you've done.

59:40.662 --> 59:44.165
She has a past,
but her past does not have her.

59:44.199 --> 59:45.800
Don't talk to me, priest.

59:46.468 --> 59:49.638
I have plenty
of your kind

59:49.671 --> 59:53.308
keeping my business
going strong.

59:53.341 --> 59:57.078
Mary, it doesn't matter
who Jesus says you are.

59:59.114 --> 01:00:00.415
I know

01:00:01.383 --> 01:00:03.618
what you are.

01:00:09.558 --> 01:00:12.260
- Come on back.
- No!

01:00:31.613 --> 01:00:33.648
No, don't listen
to him.

01:00:33.682 --> 01:00:35.817
He is just a man
from your past.

01:00:39.654 --> 01:00:41.356
There were more.

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:52.901
<i>♪ The last
time I saw this place</i>

01:00:52.934 --> 01:00:57.305
<i>♪ I was dragged
through the street</i>

01:00:57.339 --> 01:01:01.276
<i>♪ Thrown to the crowds

01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:04.846

01:01:07.215 --> 01:01:10.151
<i>♪ I heard voices shouting</i>

01:01:10.185 --> 01:01:11.353

01:01:11.386 --> 01:01:14.623
<i>♪ She's not worth the price</i>

<i>♪ Of life ♪</i>

01:01:33.241 --> 01:01:34.142
But then...

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:36.411
I heard his voice.

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:40.315
You are healed
from your sickness.

01:01:44.853 --> 01:01:47.789
There are six days
of the week for working!

01:01:47.822 --> 01:01:51.226
Come on those days to be
healed, not on the Sabbath!

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.495
You hypocrites!

01:01:53.528 --> 01:01:55.330
Don't you untie your donkey
from its stall

01:01:55.363 --> 01:01:57.899
on the Sabbath
and lead it out for water?

01:01:57.932 --> 01:02:01.436
This child was held
in bondage by Satan.

01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:04.472
Isn't it right she be
released, even on the Sabbath?

01:02:04.506 --> 01:02:07.242
He breaks
the laws of our fathers!

01:02:07.275 --> 01:02:09.544
I did not come to break
the law but to fulfill it.

01:02:10.412 --> 01:02:13.348
Answer this, Jesus!

01:02:13.381 --> 01:02:16.351
This woman was caught
in the very act of adultery!

01:02:16.384 --> 01:02:19.554
The law of Moses says
she must be stoned to death.

01:02:21.322 --> 01:02:22.457
What do you say

01:02:23.558 --> 01:02:24.893
"teacher?"

01:02:24.926 --> 01:02:26.561
<i>♪ He said to those men</i>

01:02:26.594 --> 01:02:28.963
<i>♪ As he drew in the dust</i>

01:02:28.998 --> 01:02:32.734
Let the one without sin,
throw your stone, if you must.

<i>♪ I waited for the

<i>♪ Then he lifted me</i>

01:02:47.016 --> 01:02:52.253

We're
taking on too much water!

01:05:27.609 --> 01:05:28.943
You have to get it out!

01:05:28.978 --> 01:05:30.879
What do we do?

01:05:30.912 --> 01:05:33.381
Did Jesus
just send us out here to die?

01:05:36.085 --> 01:05:37.418
What is that?

01:05:37.452 --> 01:05:38.486
Is it another boat?

01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:39.721
That's not a boat.

01:05:39.754 --> 01:05:41.023
That's a man!

01:05:41.056 --> 01:05:43.192
It can't be!
Is it a spirit?

01:05:43.225 --> 01:05:47.528
- Don't be afraid! I'm here!
- Jesus!

01:05:47.562 --> 01:05:51.532

01:05:53.202 --> 01:05:55.937
- Jesus, save us!

01:05:55.970 --> 01:06:01.542
Lord, if it's really you,
tell me to come to you!

01:06:01.576 --> 01:06:05.047

Peter,

01:06:13.821 --> 01:06:16.958
Look at him!
Peter's walking on water!

01:06:16.992 --> 01:06:18.160
I can't believe this!

01:06:18.193 --> 01:06:20.461
- G
- o brother! Keep walking!

01:06:22.597 --> 01:06:24.532
How is he doing that?

01:06:24.565 --> 01:06:25.700
Keep coming, Peter.

01:06:27.902 --> 01:06:29.071

You're almost there!

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.742
But the waves!

01:06:34.776 --> 01:06:36.644
Keep your eyes on me!

01:06:36.678 --> 01:06:40.249
Oh, Lord! I'm scared!
Lord, I'm scared!

01:06:40.282 --> 01:06:43.085
Don't look at the storm around you!
Look at me!

01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:02.071

01:07:17.852 --> 01:07:20.755
Storm! Be still!

Peace.

01:07:34.003 --> 01:07:38.539
You...
are the son of God.

01:07:40.875 --> 01:07:42.211
I am.

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.153
And you have seen me
rescue the lost...

01:07:53.122 --> 01:07:55.723
the blind, the sick...

01:07:57.159 --> 01:07:58.593
those who are tormented...

01:08:00.062 --> 01:08:02.064
and those sinking
beneath the storms of life.

01:08:03.999 --> 01:08:07.869
But I did not come
just to rescue these few.

01:09:35.023 --> 01:09:36.691
It's not safe
to be here, Lord.

01:09:36.724 --> 01:09:38.993
We're too close
to Jerusalem.

01:09:39.027 --> 01:09:41.997
The Pharisees are looking
for any excuse to capture you.

01:09:42.029 --> 01:09:44.698
Our friend Lazarus
has fallen asleep,

01:09:45.367 --> 01:09:47.801
and now I will go
and wake him.

01:09:47.835 --> 01:09:49.937
Yeah, but, Lord,
if he's only sleeping, why do we...

01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:51.439
Lazarus is dead.

01:09:51.473 --> 01:09:53.442
No, Lord. Not Lazarus.

01:09:53.475 --> 01:09:55.177
That's who
everyone is mourning?

01:09:55.210 --> 01:09:57.845
We should've come
sooner. You...

01:09:57.879 --> 01:10:01.016
- You could've done something.
- For your sakes, I'm glad I wasn't here.

01:10:01.049 --> 01:10:03.452
This will help
your faith to grow.

01:10:03.485 --> 01:10:06.989
Look who has finally arrived.
Jesus is here.

01:10:08.423 --> 01:10:10.791
Why weren't you
here when they needed you?

01:10:10.825 --> 01:10:12.727
Surround the Master.
Keep watch.

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:13.928
What good
are your miracles now?

01:10:13.961 --> 01:10:16.098
Peter, it's Martha.
Let her through.

01:10:16.131 --> 01:10:17.865
Oh, my Lord.

01:10:17.899 --> 01:10:20.068
My Lord,
there was nothing that I could do.

01:10:20.902 --> 01:10:22.471
I knew that he was sick,

01:10:22.504 --> 01:10:24.406
but he wouldn't listen
when I told him to rest.

01:10:27.808 --> 01:10:30.179
We sent for you.

01:10:30.212 --> 01:10:32.847
If you had been here,
he would not have died.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:37.119
Martha, I am the
resurrection and the life.

01:10:38.086 --> 01:10:39.188
Do you believe this?

01:10:39.787 --> 01:10:40.922
Yes, Lord.

01:10:42.024 --> 01:10:43.392
Where is Mary?

01:10:43.425 --> 01:10:45.760
Oh, she's at home,
grieving deeply.

01:10:45.793 --> 01:10:48.330
She doesn't understand
why you weren't here sooner.

01:10:48.363 --> 01:10:49.897
- Bring her to me.
- Yes.

01:10:54.102 --> 01:10:56.804
Look at them over there.

01:10:57.772 --> 01:10:59.341
Like vultures.

01:10:59.374 --> 01:11:01.143
They must have known
we were coming.

01:11:01.176 --> 01:11:04.313
Jesus, you'll take the time
to heal sinners,

01:11:04.346 --> 01:11:06.914
Gentiles and degenerates,

01:11:06.948 --> 01:11:08.483
but what about
your own friends?

01:11:08.517 --> 01:11:10.385
Hypocrites!

01:11:10.419 --> 01:11:12.820
You are like
whitewashed tombs,

01:11:12.853 --> 01:11:16.391
beautiful on the outside,
but filled with death on the inside!

01:11:16.425 --> 01:11:17.593
Outwardly you appear
so righteous,

01:11:17.626 --> 01:11:21.029
but your hearts are full of
greed, control and power.

01:11:21.063 --> 01:11:24.433
And who do you think
you are, Nazarene?

01:11:25.833 --> 01:11:30.005
My Lord,
why did you not come?

01:11:30.038 --> 01:11:34.543
Yes, where were you, Jesus,
when his sisters sent for you?

01:11:34.576 --> 01:11:35.978
I am here now.

01:11:36.911 --> 01:11:38.247
Where have you put him?

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.115
Lord, come and see.

01:11:54.529 --> 01:11:58.233
Look!
Even Jesus weeps for Lazarus.

01:11:58.267 --> 01:12:00.801
He healed a blind man!

01:12:00.835 --> 01:12:04.839
Couldn't he have kept Lazarus,
his own friend, from dying?

01:12:06.041 --> 01:12:07.409
Death.

01:12:07.442 --> 01:12:09.011
What is he saying?

01:12:09.044 --> 01:12:11.580
He is praying to his Father,
the Devil, no doubt.

01:12:11.613 --> 01:12:15.850
Yes, do speak up, Teacher,
so we can all hear what you have to say.

01:12:17.252 --> 01:12:18.587
Roll the stone aside.

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:21.822
What?
That is unlawful!

01:12:21.856 --> 01:12:24.326
Roll the stone aside!

01:12:24.359 --> 01:12:27.095
How dare you!
Do not shame Lazarus like this!

01:12:27.129 --> 01:12:30.432
No. No. No, Lord,
he has been dead for four days.

01:12:30.465 --> 01:12:32.134
No, this is too far.

01:12:32.167 --> 01:12:34.036
No, the smell
will be terrible.

01:12:34.069 --> 01:12:36.138
This is not what
Lazarus would want.

01:12:36.171 --> 01:12:37.838
Martha,
didn't I tell you that

01:12:37.872 --> 01:12:39.840
I am the resurrection
and the life?

01:12:39.874 --> 01:12:42.244
Thomas, you heard him. Let's go.

01:12:42.277 --> 01:12:44.613
Father! Thank you
for hearing me.

01:12:44.646 --> 01:12:46.481
I know that
you always hear me,

01:12:46.515 --> 01:12:48.949
but I am saying this
so that everyone can believe

01:12:48.984 --> 01:12:50.485
that you are the one
who sent me!

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.189
I am the resurrection
and the life!

01:12:54.222 --> 01:12:55.823
Blasphemer!

01:13:01.496 --> 01:13:04.166
Lazarus! Arise!

01:13:04.899 --> 01:13:07.602
Arise? People,
can't you see?

01:13:08.003 --> 01:13:10.105
He's a deceiver!

01:13:10.138 --> 01:13:15.110
A carpenter who says
he comes from heaven!

01:13:15.143 --> 01:13:19.281
Am I the only one with eyes to see

01:13:19.314 --> 01:13:22.451
and ears to hear?

01:13:30.925 --> 01:13:31.926
Jesus.

01:13:33.095 --> 01:13:34.663
I heard your voice.

01:13:34.696 --> 01:13:36.631
This changes everything!

01:13:36.665 --> 01:13:40.469
Jesus raised Lazarus
from the dead!

01:13:40.502 --> 01:13:43.672
Hosanna!

Who is Jesus?

01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:38.693
He was sent from heaven!
I think he's a king.

01:14:38.727 --> 01:14:41.496
And he is coming to Jerusalem right now!
Here, take one!

01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:44.299

A donkey?
Joseph!

01:15:11.426 --> 01:15:14.229
Joseph, didn't the prophet
Zechariah say that...

01:15:14.262 --> 01:15:15.497
Yes.

01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:17.332
"Shout and cheer,

01:16:27.769 --> 01:16:30.138
What is the cause
of this chaos?

01:16:30.171 --> 01:16:32.274
The one they call Jesus
is the cause of this.

01:16:32.307 --> 01:16:35.176
And he went in that direction,
riding on a donkey.

01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:39.381
Tell Caiaphas it is his
responsibility to control his flock!

01:16:39.414 --> 01:16:42.050
I don't have time for
chasing after stupid sheep.

01:16:46.888 --> 01:16:51.526
This Jesus is turning
Jerusalem upside down!

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.396
Caiaphas has called
for an emergency assembly.

01:17:30.465 --> 01:17:32.634
In just a few days
it is my sacred duty

01:17:32.667 --> 01:17:34.636
to perform
the Passover sacrifice

01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:37.138
for the people.

01:17:37.172 --> 01:17:41.309
To offer a perfect lamb to
Jehovah God on their behalf.

01:17:43.945 --> 01:17:48.717
But I think the recent,
blasphemous sins of the people

01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:52.153
may be too great
for God's mercy.

01:17:52.187 --> 01:17:55.156
We need
an even greater sacrifice.

01:17:55.190 --> 01:17:57.692
Do you mean
to kill this Nazarene?

01:17:57.726 --> 01:18:00.362
Isn't it better
if one man dies

01:18:00.395 --> 01:18:01.630
rather than a whole nation?

01:18:01.663 --> 01:18:04.833
This Jesus of Nazareth is
leading the people away from God

01:18:04.866 --> 01:18:07.836
and straight
to their destruction!

01:18:07.869 --> 01:18:09.738
As High Priest,
the Lord speaks through me,

01:18:09.771 --> 01:18:11.740
and I believe it is His will

01:18:11.773 --> 01:18:15.744
and my solemn duty
to remove this threat...

01:18:16.478 --> 01:18:17.345
permanently.

01:18:18.446 --> 01:18:20.482
All of us agree.

01:18:20.515 --> 01:18:21.616
But we've tried
to trap him

01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:23.718
into saying or doing
something illegal,

01:18:23.752 --> 01:18:26.688
but still,
he will not stumble!

01:18:26.721 --> 01:18:30.458
Jesus is a rebel who calls himself God!
Isn't that reason enough?

01:18:30.492 --> 01:18:32.394
Yes.

01:18:32.427 --> 01:18:35.397
We just need to prove
he is also a danger to Rome.

01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:37.298
- We need to capture him...
- Yes.

01:18:37.332 --> 01:18:38.466
- ...try him...
- Yes.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.735
- And do away with him!
- Yes!

01:18:40.769 --> 01:18:42.270
Is it legal to convict a man

01:18:42.303 --> 01:18:43.705
before he is given
a hearing?

01:18:43.738 --> 01:18:44.773
Who said that?

01:18:49.944 --> 01:18:53.882
You cannot put him on
trial without cause.

01:18:53.915 --> 01:18:57.686
Without cause, Nicodemus?
Are you blind?

01:18:59.487 --> 01:19:00.755
Not anymore.

01:19:01.589 --> 01:19:02.992
Neither am I.

01:19:03.025 --> 01:19:08.463
Joseph, you of all people would
follow a man who eats with sinners,

01:19:08.496 --> 01:19:11.900
touches lepers,
keeps company with prostitutes?

01:19:11.933 --> 01:19:13.868
Jesus shows the people
what he's for,

01:19:13.902 --> 01:19:15.970
instead of just
what he's against.

01:19:16.005 --> 01:19:20.241
And the prophets of old did far stranger
things, Caiaphas. You know that.

01:19:20.275 --> 01:19:22.877
Isaiah wandered the land
naked for three years.

01:19:22.911 --> 01:19:24.746
Hosea married a prostitute!

01:19:24.779 --> 01:19:27.016
Ezekiel ate barley cakes
cooked with excrement!

01:19:27.049 --> 01:19:29.551
But everything they did
pointed to God!

01:19:29.584 --> 01:19:32.520
Everything this son of a
carpenter does points to...

01:19:32.554 --> 01:19:34.322
Love!

01:19:35.323 --> 01:19:37.525
Love!

01:19:37.559 --> 01:19:41.429
Everything Jesus does
points to love!

01:19:41.463 --> 01:19:45.000
I have pored over the Scriptures,
and I have found this.

01:19:45.034 --> 01:19:47.203
The law is love.

01:19:47.569 --> 01:19:48.670
God is love!

01:19:48.703 --> 01:19:52.640
The love of God is reserved
for those who keep the law!

01:19:52.674 --> 01:19:54.375
Yes!

01:19:54.409 --> 01:19:55.944
You burden the people
with rules,

01:19:55.978 --> 01:19:58.013
but you never lift
a finger to help them!

01:19:59.081 --> 01:20:00.749
You don't care
about God's love!

01:20:00.782 --> 01:20:03.818
All you care about is the law,
so you can control them.

01:20:03.852 --> 01:20:06.021
And you. You play God

01:20:06.055 --> 01:20:07.922
so that others are forced
to look up to you!

01:20:07.956 --> 01:20:09.724
Nicodemus.
I demand you to be silent!

01:20:09.758 --> 01:20:11.593
You always want to measure
everyone's righteousness,

01:20:11.626 --> 01:20:14.362
- but you cannot measure God's love!
- Nicodemus!

01:20:14.395 --> 01:20:17.599
That is why Jesus himself said
that prostitutes and sinners

01:20:17.632 --> 01:20:19.034
are closer to heaven
than any of us!

01:20:19.068 --> 01:20:20.301
Silence!

01:20:42.857 --> 01:20:48.329
Tell me, if this man
is all about love...

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:53.802
then why did one
of his own betray him?

01:20:56.771 --> 01:20:58.240
Judas!

01:20:58.274 --> 01:21:02.811
This man testifies that Jesus
manipulated the minds of simple fishermen

01:21:02.844 --> 01:21:05.547
to wander all over Israel,

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:08.550
encouraging them to break
the sacred commandments!

01:21:10.052 --> 01:21:13.088
Ask him how
this king of the Jews

01:21:13.122 --> 01:21:16.391
allowed a poor,
destitute woman

01:21:16.424 --> 01:21:21.096
to pour a rare perfume, her life
savings, mind you, on his feet...

01:21:23.464 --> 01:21:25.967
instead of giving
the money to the poor?

01:21:29.404 --> 01:21:31.106
This Jesus
is a glutton.

01:21:32.574 --> 01:21:34.542
He's a drunkard
and a rebel.

01:21:36.678 --> 01:21:40.648
It's all beginning to collapse
around this phony Messiah.

01:21:40.682 --> 01:21:43.518
This would be a very bad
time to choose his side.

01:21:46.521 --> 01:21:47.722
Too late.

01:21:49.457 --> 01:21:51.459
You're not just
turning your back on me.

01:21:51.492 --> 01:21:53.828
You're turning your back
on God!

01:21:56.131 --> 01:21:57.966
Jesus is God!

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.801
- What?
- Blasphemous!

01:21:59.834 --> 01:22:02.837
Blasphemer! Get him out!

01:22:02.871 --> 01:22:06.608
Jesus is God!
Jesus is God!

01:22:06.641 --> 01:22:09.144
- Blasphemer!
- Jesus is God!

01:22:09.178 --> 01:22:11.180
You promised me no one
would know I betrayed him!

01:22:11.213 --> 01:22:12.480
Tomorrow he'll be dead,

01:22:12.513 --> 01:22:15.017
and his followers will run
back to their boats in Galilee.

01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:16.417
Why do you care
what they think?

01:22:17.219 --> 01:22:19.621
Do you still believe?

01:22:19.654 --> 01:22:23.158
I believe I just wasted three
years of my life on that man.

01:22:25.194 --> 01:22:27.562
Bring Jesus to us

01:22:27.595 --> 01:22:29.764
and redeem
those wasted years, Judas.

01:25:46.261 --> 01:25:47.329
Judas...

01:25:49.164 --> 01:25:50.299
come and sit by me.

01:25:52.301 --> 01:25:53.368
Next to you?

01:25:56.904 --> 01:25:59.907
Teacher, no, let...
Let someone else.

01:25:59.941 --> 01:26:02.677
Please, my friend.

01:26:09.717 --> 01:26:11.786
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:27:11.313 --> 01:27:12.747
My friends...

01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:17.818
I have longed
to eat this meal with you.

01:27:22.457 --> 01:27:24.459
Do you see this bread
that I hold?

01:27:27.762 --> 01:27:28.896
Take it.

01:27:32.401 --> 01:27:36.771
This bread is my body...
broken for you.

01:27:39.308 --> 01:27:41.176
Take it and eat it.

01:27:44.112 --> 01:27:47.782
And as you do,
remember me.

01:27:53.854 --> 01:27:57.092
This wine is my blood...

01:27:59.494 --> 01:28:01.729
poured out for you
and for the sins of man.

01:28:04.099 --> 01:28:05.766
Take it and drink it.

01:28:10.138 --> 01:28:11.772
But my heart aches tonight...

01:28:13.442 --> 01:28:15.377
because one that I call friend
will betray me.

01:28:15.943 --> 01:28:17.179
What?

01:28:19.214 --> 01:28:22.950
Nobody here
will betray you, Lord.

01:28:22.985 --> 01:28:24.819
- Of course not.
- Why will anybody betray you?

01:28:26.854 --> 01:28:28.457
- Jesus, I...
- Hurry...

01:28:29.224 --> 01:28:31.393
and do what you're
going to do.

01:28:39.234 --> 01:28:41.503
- Where's Judas?
- He just left.

01:28:41.536 --> 01:28:44.039
My Lord, I would
never betray you.

01:28:44.072 --> 01:28:45.940
I've been with you
since the beginning.

01:28:45.973 --> 01:28:49.111
No, I was with him
before you.

01:28:49.144 --> 01:28:52.547
Well, he came and sought
me out and chose me.

01:28:52.581 --> 01:28:54.949
You just happened to be there
when others were following him.

01:28:54.983 --> 01:28:56.285
How can you even say that!

01:28:56.318 --> 01:29:00.289
We were there for one of his
first big miracles. You weren't!

01:29:00.322 --> 01:29:02.457
Yeah, and that miracle
happened in my boat!

01:29:02.491 --> 01:29:04.426
You don't even own
your own boat!

01:29:08.630 --> 01:29:12.534
Brothers, you will all run away
tonight and leave me alone.

01:29:15.437 --> 01:29:16.837
Peter...

01:29:18.307 --> 01:29:19.874
before the rooster
crows twice,

01:29:19.907 --> 01:29:22.210
you will deny three times
that you even know me.

01:29:31.253 --> 01:29:35.424
Lord, if I have to die with
you, I will not deny you!

01:29:35.457 --> 01:29:36.458
My friends...

01:29:39.061 --> 01:29:41.563
I don't call you servants...

01:29:41.596 --> 01:29:44.132
because a servant doesn't
know what his master is doing.

01:29:47.169 --> 01:29:51.139
Everything that the Father has said to
me, I have shared with you.

01:29:53.675 --> 01:29:57.579
You are my friends,
and I love you.

01:30:03.985 --> 01:30:08.023
And now I am giving you
a new commandment.

01:30:09.191 --> 01:30:10.392
Love one another...

01:30:12.227 --> 01:30:14.196
in the same way
that I have loved you.

01:30:16.131 --> 01:30:18.133
It's by your love
for each other

01:30:18.166 --> 01:30:20.235
that the world will know
that you are my followers.

01:30:24.172 --> 01:30:27.175
Greater love
has no one than this...

01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:31.079
than to lay down his life
for his friends.

01:30:34.216 --> 01:30:37.285
My friends, in a little while
you will no longer see me.

01:30:37.319 --> 01:30:39.354
Don't be afraid!

01:30:39.388 --> 01:30:41.089
I will not leave you alone.

01:30:42.657 --> 01:30:46.528
After I'm gone,
my Father will send the Holy Spirit.

01:30:46.561 --> 01:30:51.032
And He will fill you,
and comfort you and give you direction.

01:30:51.066 --> 01:30:54.569
With the Holy Spirit,
you and every believer after you,

01:30:54.603 --> 01:30:56.104
will bring glory to my Father.

01:30:57.972 --> 01:31:00.041
In this way,
I will always be with you.

01:31:02.611 --> 01:31:05.147
But now I must go

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:07.948
and prepare a place for you
so that where I am,

01:31:08.717 --> 01:31:12.120
my friends, you can also be.

01:31:12.154 --> 01:31:15.956
But Lord,
we don't know where you are going.

01:31:17.426 --> 01:31:19.294
How can we know the way?

01:31:20.462 --> 01:31:24.099
I am the way,
the truth, and the life!

01:31:27.035 --> 01:31:30.105
No one comes to the Father
except through me.

01:31:30.138 --> 01:31:33.241
Please don't leave.
I want you to stay with us.

01:31:33.275 --> 01:31:35.510
If I do not go,
the Holy Spirit cannot come to you.

01:31:37.212 --> 01:31:39.481
I tell you the truth.

01:31:39.514 --> 01:31:42.384
If you believe in me, you will be
able to do the things that I have done

01:31:42.417 --> 01:31:45.086
and even greater things.

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:48.023
This can only happen
if I go and be with my Father.

01:31:49.458 --> 01:31:52.494
In this world
you will have trouble...

01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:59.534
but take heart,
I have overcome the world.

01:32:03.705 --> 01:32:07.008
Come, my friends,
it's time to go.

01:32:09.144 --> 01:32:11.079
John, would you sing for us?

01:32:14.783 --> 01:32:20.088

- I love you, Lord.
- I love you, too, John.

01:33:20.215 --> 01:33:22.551
And soon you will look up
and see just how much.

01:33:31.226 --> 01:33:32.561
My Lord and my God.

01:33:34.262 --> 01:33:38.333
I need you with me
tonight, Peter, the Rock.

01:33:40.735 --> 01:33:43.138
I will not
leave your side.

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.675
I promise.

01:33:54.182 --> 01:33:58.720
Father, the hour has come.

01:34:01.289 --> 01:34:04.359
I pray for these
that you have given me.

01:34:04.392 --> 01:34:07.262
Protect them that they
would be one as we are one.

01:34:09.564 --> 01:34:11.866
The world hates them because
they do not belong to it.

01:34:14.169 --> 01:34:16.237
I'm not asking that you would
take them out of the world,

01:34:16.271 --> 01:34:18.373
but that you would keep
them safe from the evil one.

01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:24.879
Just as you sent me into the
world, I am sending them.

01:34:27.849 --> 01:34:30.518
And I give myself
as a holy sacrifice...

01:34:32.754 --> 01:34:36.658
not only for these disciples but
alsofor everyone who will believe in me

01:34:37.659 --> 01:34:38.893
through their message.

01:35:47.696 --> 01:35:49.531
Peter? James, John?

01:35:49.564 --> 01:35:50.732
Yes, Lord.

01:35:50.765 --> 01:35:52.801
Can you stay awake
with me and pray?

01:35:52.834 --> 01:35:54.202
Yes, Lord.

01:35:58.473 --> 01:35:59.841
Keep watch with me,
brothers!

01:36:03.012 --> 01:36:04.446
And do not give in
to temptation.

01:36:09.284 --> 01:36:09.985
<i>Jesus.</i>

01:36:10.919 --> 01:36:12.353
Satan.

01:36:13.621 --> 01:36:14.856
<i>Peace.</i>

01:36:16.825 --> 01:36:19.260
<i>Peace to you, Lamb of God.</i>

01:36:21.463 --> 01:36:25.266
<i>Oh, do you hear that sound?</i>

01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:28.870
<i>It's the cries of hundreds
of Passover lambs.</i>

01:36:30.538 --> 01:36:34.309
<i>Tomorrow, they will be
slaughtered and so will you...</i>

01:36:35.677 --> 01:36:38.680
<i>unless somehow,</i>

01:36:38.713 --> 01:36:41.282
<i>there's another way.</i>

01:36:41.316 --> 01:36:42.484
Father,

01:36:43.551 --> 01:36:47.422
strengthen me, I'm weak.

01:36:47.455 --> 01:36:50.592
<i>You're swallowing
the sewage of all the sins</i>

01:36:50.625 --> 01:36:54.029
<i>of every human who's ever lived.</i>

01:36:54.063 --> 01:36:56.631
<i>You're sick with it already</i>

01:36:56.664 --> 01:36:58.933
<i>and it's only begun.</i>

01:37:00.435 --> 01:37:04.272
<i>There has to be another way.
There has to be.</i>

01:37:05.673 --> 01:37:06.875
Father...

01:37:08.343 --> 01:37:10.411
if it is possible,

01:37:10.445 --> 01:37:12.514
let me not drink
from this cup.

01:37:13.048 --> 01:37:14.582
<i>Yes.</i>

01:37:16.718 --> 01:37:18.486
Yet not as I will...

01:37:20.355 --> 01:37:21.823
but as you will.

01:37:23.892 --> 01:37:25.960
Peter, James, John?

01:37:27.595 --> 01:37:30.465
Can you not stay awake
with me and pray?

01:37:30.498 --> 01:37:32.300
<i>You do know
what's coming next.</i>

01:37:32.934 --> 01:37:36.437
<i>You will not only taste sin,</i>

01:37:36.471 --> 01:37:39.340
<i>you will become it,
be filled with it,</i>

01:37:39.974 --> 01:37:42.077
<i>infected with it,</i>

01:37:42.111 --> 01:37:44.412
<i>and die because of it.</i>

01:37:44.445 --> 01:37:46.881
<i>Is that what you want
your legacy to be?</i>

01:37:47.582 --> 01:37:49.350
Abba!

01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:54.389
My spirit is willing...

01:37:55.824 --> 01:37:57.559
but my flesh is weak.

01:37:57.592 --> 01:37:59.828
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>

01:37:59.861 --> 01:38:02.064
Father,

01:38:02.097 --> 01:38:06.467
if it is possible,
take this away from me.

01:38:06.501 --> 01:38:09.838
<i>With God, all things are possible.</i>

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:12.874
My friends.

01:38:15.177 --> 01:38:17.046
My friends,
are you still sleeping?

01:38:19.848 --> 01:38:22.617
- I'm alone.
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:25.620
<i>And that's
the worst one of all.</i>

01:38:25.653 --> 01:38:28.556
- <i>Your friends have abandoned you.</i>
- Father!

01:38:28.590 --> 01:38:32.360
<i>And soon, your Abba Father
will abandon you.</i>

01:38:33.862 --> 01:38:37.565
<i>Who is there to rescue you?</i>

01:38:37.599 --> 01:38:42.071
<i>Your father is going to let you die.</i>

01:38:43.538 --> 01:38:46.541
<i>I can help.
We'll find another way.</i>

01:38:47.009 --> 01:38:48.676
<i>I promise.</i>

01:38:50.079 --> 01:38:51.880
There is no other way.

01:38:51.913 --> 01:38:53.848
<i>What about your will?</i>

01:38:53.882 --> 01:38:55.450
<i>What about your will?</i>

01:38:56.018 --> 01:38:57.619
<i>Your will, Jesus.</i>

01:38:57.652 --> 01:38:59.520
<i>But what about your will?</i>

01:38:59.554 --> 01:39:01.156
<i>Your will, Jesus.</i>

01:39:01.190 --> 01:39:03.524
<i>But what about your will?</i>

01:39:03.558 --> 01:39:05.693
<i>But what about your will?</i>

01:39:08.897 --> 01:39:10.498
Not my will!

01:39:12.634 --> 01:39:14.103
His will be done.

01:39:16.038 --> 01:39:19.141
Your will be done, Father...

01:39:20.575 --> 01:39:22.577
on Earth as it is in heaven.

01:39:31.953 --> 01:39:33.421
Brothers.

01:39:34.923 --> 01:39:36.524
My betrayer is here.

01:40:00.015 --> 01:40:01.582
Greetings, Rabbi.

01:40:03.551 --> 01:40:05.220
Do what you must,
Judas.

01:40:15.596 --> 01:40:19.534
You are Jesus
of Nazareth?

01:40:20.635 --> 01:40:22.537
I am!

01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.875
Lord! Run!

01:40:31.146 --> 01:40:33.815
My ear!

01:40:35.217 --> 01:40:37.518
Be healed.

01:40:37.552 --> 01:40:41.290
Peter, I can ask my Father for
thousands of angels to protect us.

01:40:41.323 --> 01:40:43.558
He would
send them instantly.

01:40:43.591 --> 01:40:44.959
I am choosing this.

01:40:44.994 --> 01:40:46.261
You blasphemer!

01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:49.264
Take him to Caiaphas!

01:40:49.999 --> 01:40:51.233
Now!

01:41:03.012 --> 01:41:04.512
Jesus.

01:41:09.084 --> 01:41:11.286
Oh, my son, my son.

01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.188
They've taken him, Mother.

01:41:16.225 --> 01:41:18.893
And they won't stop
until he's dead.

01:41:25.733 --> 01:41:27.702
Pray.

01:41:29.837 --> 01:41:31.739
John, pray.

People of Israel,
listen!

02:07:00.036 --> 02:07:05.507
What you see here was predicted
long ago by the prophet Joel.

02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:08.209
The Lord said,
"In the last days,

02:07:08.243 --> 02:07:11.846
"I will pour out my Spirit
upon all people,

02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:16.151
"and everyone who calls on the
name of the Lord will be saved."

As you well know,

02:07:18.587 --> 02:07:22.157
God performed powerful miracles
through Jesus of Nazareth.

02:07:22.624 --> 02:07:25.327
But with the help of Rome,

02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:29.264
you nailed him to a cross
and killed him!

02:07:29.297 --> 02:07:32.567
But God
raised him from the dead,

02:07:32.601 --> 02:07:36.304
so that we can be raised
from death to life!

02:07:36.338 --> 02:07:40.809
Jesus became our Passover lamb
once and for all.

02:07:40.842 --> 02:07:44.346
So let everyone in Israel know
that God has made Jesus

02:07:44.379 --> 02:07:47.248

This is how
you can be born again!

02:07:54.556 --> 02:07:57.492

02:07:57.525 --> 02:07:59.494
