LORNE: Mystical variety.

junk, slayers are all super, right?

Yeah. Until I can channel it
into the Orb of Thessulah.

31:57.373 --> 31:59.250
Connor shouldn't have run off like that.

31:59.453 --> 32:01.967
I'm sure he's just worried about Cordelia.

32:02.533 --> 32:07.926
Do you ever think their relationship
is maybe a little bit icky?

32:08.613 --> 32:12.572
You have to kill your father.
You have to.

32:13.733 --> 32:15.007
Now.

32:16.133 --> 32:18.852
Before anything else goes wrong.

32:20.933 --> 32:22.924
Ready when you are.

32:23.333 --> 32:26.882
[CHANTING]

32:36.213 --> 32:41.048
You know I have fought harder than
anyone to save Angel's life.

32:42.293 --> 32:45.968
But there comes a time when you
have to weigh risk verses reward.

32:46.333 --> 32:50.042
And as much as I love Angel,
as a friend...

32:50.773 --> 32:57.372
Killing Angelus now is the only way
to guarantee our family's safety.

33:00.893 --> 33:03.361
<i>I know it in my heart now.</i>

33:04.173 --> 33:09.486
<i>You're not just protecting me.</i>
<i>You're protecting the world.</i>

33:11.013 --> 33:15.450
<i>Sometimes one death</i>
<i>can spare infinite pain.</i>

33:21.733 --> 33:23.644
ANGEL:
Faith, wake up!

33:25.453 --> 33:28.604
Rolled the bones. You for me.

33:33.533 --> 33:37.208
I used to think that there'd be
a point when I'd paid my dues.

33:38.653 --> 33:41.645
Anybody notice a battle with
your alter ego going on here?

33:43.013 --> 33:45.163
CONNOR:
<i>What will I tell the others?</i>

33:45.773 --> 33:48.651
CORDELIA:
<i>They can 't stop you if they don 't know.</i>

33:49.813 --> 33:52.043
CONNOR:
<i>What about the sanctuary spell?</i>

33:52.613 --> 33:54.444
CORDELIA:
<i>I can fix it.</i>

33:55.973 --> 33:58.203
<i>We're special, Connor.</i>

34:22.132 --> 34:24.522
ANGEL:
Faith, listen to me.

34:25.333 --> 34:28.768
You saw me drink.
It doesn't get much lower than that.

34:29.373 --> 34:32.409
And I thought I could make
up for it by disappearing.

34:32.652 --> 34:35.042
I did my time.

34:35.853 --> 34:38.492
Our time is never up, Faith.

34:38.773 --> 34:41.924
- We pay for everything.
- It hurts.

34:42.293 --> 34:43.772
I know.

34:44.533 --> 34:45.806
I know.

[CHANTING]

CONNOR:
Hey, Gunn.

34:58.773 --> 35:01.606
You should know, they haven't
finished the spell yet.

35:02.653 --> 35:03.881
ANGEL:
<i>Get up.</i>

35:05.013 --> 35:07.368
You have to get up now, Faith.

35:07.573 --> 35:12.169
You have to fight. I need you to fight.
You understand what I'm saying?

35:15.013 --> 35:17.208
What won't I miss?

35:19.373 --> 35:20.886
The moralizing.

35:21.173 --> 35:24.848
Soul's already in the ether, boy-o.
I can smell it.

35:25.013 --> 35:29.006
How about I send it off to that
big puppy rescue in the sky?

35:29.613 --> 35:32.207
FAITH:
Arf-arf, psycho.

35:32.373 --> 35:33.772
[ANGELUS CHUCKLING]

35:34.773 --> 35:38.402
Faith.
Getting back into the game.

35:38.613 --> 35:40.205
I guess I am.

35:42.533 --> 35:43.852
Hey!

[CHANTING]

35:56.533 --> 35:59.047
[ANGELUS SCREAMS]

36:03.973 --> 36:07.727
- Need you to fight.
- I'm pretty clear about what you need.

36:08.533 --> 36:10.330
Break me off a switch, son.

36:11.853 --> 36:13.571
There's about to be a whupping.

36:25.653 --> 36:28.042
She's alive! It's a miracle!

36:43.693 --> 36:46.526
Connor, it's over. It's me.

36:46.933 --> 36:48.207
Really.

37:03.373 --> 37:04.852
FAITH:
Hey.

37:05.533 --> 37:07.091
ANGEL:
How you feeling?

37:07.333 --> 37:10.211
Like I did mushrooms
and got eaten by a bear.

37:10.413 --> 37:12.290
- That about sums it up.
- Yep.

37:12.733 --> 37:14.166
Now you're going to Sunnydale.

37:14.613 --> 37:15.887
I think I prefer the bear.

37:16.053 --> 37:18.692
But the way Willow talks it up,
that's where I'm needed.

37:18.893 --> 37:20.292
You never stop fighting.

37:20.773 --> 37:24.322
Hey, I was gonna, but someone
got all pep-talky on me.

37:24.493 --> 37:25.812
Yeah.

37:26.093 --> 37:30.132
I'm sorry I didn't get to see you,
our little brain tour notwithstanding.

37:30.333 --> 37:32.051
Another time.

37:32.973 --> 37:35.009
I have a lot to thank you for.

37:35.813 --> 37:38.850
Well, that vice is plenty versa.
Don't even start.

37:39.013 --> 37:40.924
It's only gonna lead to hugging and...

37:41.093 --> 37:42.412
- We can't have that.
- No.

37:43.653 --> 37:46.884
CONNOR:
All right, I get it. I messed up.

37:47.053 --> 37:49.283
Hey, cheer up, punk.
It just makes you one of us.

37:49.453 --> 37:50.727
You headed out?

37:50.893 --> 37:52.884
- Hey, no tears, big guy.
- No, I'm good.

37:53.053 --> 37:55.692
I wish I could've seen you
kicking the crap out of Junior.

37:55.853 --> 37:56.888
It was pretty funny.

Wes...

38:03.173 --> 38:04.652
Faith.

38:05.333 --> 38:09.008
See? Brits know how to say goodbye.
Angel here wanted to hug.

38:09.173 --> 38:10.447
No, I didn't.

38:11.173 --> 38:12.492
You run a good show.

38:12.653 --> 38:15.451
Yeah, sit back and let
the girl do all the heavy lifting.

38:16.853 --> 38:18.127
That's pretty much it.

38:18.533 --> 38:20.205
FRED:
I think that volume is outdated.

38:20.413 --> 38:25.043
You'd know better than me, but there's
some interesting stuff about hell mouths.

38:25.213 --> 38:27.044
- It might help.
- This is great.

38:27.373 --> 38:31.207
I have to say, some day I'd love to bend
your ear about the Pergamum Codex.

38:31.413 --> 38:33.973
Some of the really obscure
passages are actually Latin...

38:34.173 --> 38:36.892
...translated from a demonic tongue.
They're kind of a hoot.

38:37.373 --> 38:40.092
All this stuff about bacchanals
and spells and...

38:40.253 --> 38:43.404
Actually, I think it's
probably funnier in Latin.

38:43.853 --> 38:47.448
- You know how that is sometimes.
- I'm seeing someone.

38:50.893 --> 38:52.451
Time goes by, Will.

38:52.693 --> 38:55.446
Okay, good. Wagons west.

38:55.613 --> 38:58.332
- See you guys.
- Willow...

38:58.893 --> 39:01.043
He's gonna tell you how much
he owes you.

39:02.093 --> 39:07.008
Oh, don't mention it. I got a slayer
out of the deal, so we're even-steven.

39:10.373 --> 39:15.208
- I'll tell Buffy you said hi.
- Good. Thanks.

39:15.933 --> 39:17.525
Oh, um...

39:17.693 --> 39:23.131
Next time you guys resurrect Angelus,
call me first, okay?

So we're back.

ANGEL: Look, I know things have been...
CORDELIA: Sorry, Angel.

39:44.173 --> 39:48.451
But if this is the speech about
how the worst is behind us...

...you may want to save it for later.
