01:44.904 --> 01:46.235
Mr. Orton?

01:49.042 --> 01:50.600
Mr. Halliwell?

01:53.012 --> 01:54.138
Hello?

02:24.911 --> 02:28.642
Dear, oh, dear. Somebody here
has been playing silly buggers.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.451
You look ill.
They have some brandy in the kitchen.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.451
I won't keep you a moment.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.908
- I can't find his diaries.
- You can't find them?

04:06.145 --> 04:08.670
- It's 20 years ago.
- But they'd be so valuable.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.875
Yes, I don't like to think
what they'd be worth.

04:10.950 --> 04:12.542
For a biographer.

04:12.785 --> 04:14.685
Tess is so disorganized.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.692
- Oh, dear.
- Don't worry.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.822
I can't stand those things.

04:26.132 --> 04:29.260
Every little word.
One can't possibly be natural.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.467
- Is it on?
- Yes.

04:31.904 --> 04:34.839
I knew nothing at all about him
the first time he walked in.

04:34.907 --> 04:38.502
When was that? My God, 1964.

04:39.379 --> 04:42.780
He had considerable confidence and charm.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.543
It was his first play, a radio thing.
I thought it was derivative.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.984
I told him so. He didn't mind.

04:48.354 --> 04:49.480
<i>I thought it was derivative.</i>

04:49.555 --> 04:51.614
<i>I told him so. He didn't mind.</i>

04:51.691 --> 04:54.216
<i>Not Joe.</i>
<i>"I'll try and write you a better one," he said.</i>

04:54.294 --> 04:56.956
<i>I said, "Well, that would be gorgeous."</i>

04:57.997 --> 04:59.521
<i>As he was leaving...</i>

05:00.199 --> 05:02.497
he said, "Next time, can I bring my friend?"

05:02.568 --> 05:04.968
And I thought, does he mean "friend"?

05:05.438 --> 05:08.373
Then I thought, yes, he does mean "friend."

05:08.741 --> 05:11.141
Which was quite bold in those days.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.613
It was the Dark Ages. Men and men.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.415
And they could still put you in prison for it.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.545
<i>And they did, dear.</i>

05:24.524 --> 05:25.923
Bollock naked?

05:26.092 --> 05:28.560
No, keep your socks on.

05:35.234 --> 05:38.260
<i>London was still quite exciting then.</i>
<i>Remember that?</i>

05:38.338 --> 05:39.771
<i>No, you wouldn't.</i>

05:40.139 --> 05:42.505
<i>- This is when?</i>
<i>- 1967.</i>

05:45.278 --> 05:48.008
- You're in good shape.
- It's the weights.

05:48.114 --> 05:50.344
When I die, I want people to say:

05:50.416 --> 05:54.113
"He was the most perfectly developed
playwright of his day."

05:54.354 --> 05:56.322
<i>Joe was having a wonderful time.</i>

05:56.389 --> 05:58.983
<i>His second play,</i> Loot <i>, was a smash hit.</i>

05:59.125 --> 06:02.288
<i>- So he was making lots of money?</i>
<i>- Oh, yes, dear.</i>

06:02.562 --> 06:04.894
<i>Offers to do this and write that.</i>

06:05.365 --> 06:08.027
<i>And he had six months to live.</i>

06:17.477 --> 06:18.842
Is that it?

06:20.279 --> 06:21.940
Is that my present?

06:22.815 --> 06:26.046
- It is terrible, darling.
- It was £14.

06:30.256 --> 06:32.417
I thought you said splash out.

06:32.492 --> 06:35.518
Cheap clothes suit me. They always have.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.392
It's because I'm from the gutter.

06:37.463 --> 06:40.057
- A contract from New Zealand.
- New Zealand?

06:40.133 --> 06:42.966
I know, but we won't think about it, dear.

06:43.369 --> 06:47.635
Am I right in thinking we're still
interested in writing the Beatles script?

06:47.707 --> 06:48.901
Oh, yes.

06:49.208 --> 06:52.268
Why don't I call Brian now
and set up a meeting?

06:52.779 --> 06:54.371
Smashing.

06:56.649 --> 06:58.116
Is it "Epstein"...

06:59.085 --> 07:00.416
or "Epstine"?

07:04.590 --> 07:05.989
Better wait.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.827
Americans are so sensitive
about their names.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.155
He's not American, is he?

07:12.231 --> 07:14.324
Well, he moves in that world.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.193
We'll see each other later?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.737
I hope people come.

07:18.805 --> 07:21.330
They will. I put out a three-line whip.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.204
- Thank you.
- How is he?

07:23.810 --> 07:25.141
He's fine.

07:44.363 --> 07:45.455
Well?

07:46.632 --> 07:47.963
It's 5:00.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.435
It's 5:15.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.162
It's only £14. Peggy hates it.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.875
- That's where you've been.
- She likes you.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.070
Peggy's one of your few fans.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.178
- Any calls?
- I've been worried stiff.

08:02.381 --> 08:04.440
Why? It doesn't start till 9:00.

08:04.517 --> 08:07.645
The whole point about irrational behavior
is that it is irrational.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.746
I don't worry about any thing. I just worry.

08:16.562 --> 08:19.963
- Stop that.
- And you stop being such a bilious queen.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.330
I've to be there by 8:00
to check the arrangements.

08:22.401 --> 08:25.165
- I'm frightened nobody will come.
- They'll come.

08:25.404 --> 08:27.463
"And what sort of day
have you had, Kenneth?"

08:29.108 --> 08:33.203
Well, not unproductive, Joe, actually.
I caught up on a big backlog of dusting.

08:33.279 --> 08:36.270
Then I went down the road
to replenish our stock of corn flakes.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.511
When I returned, I rinsed a selection
of your soiled underclothes...

08:39.585 --> 08:42.782
by which time it was 4:00,
the hour of your scheduled return.

08:42.855 --> 08:46.484
When you failed to come, I redeemed
the shining hour by cutting my toenails.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.289
What did you expect me to do?
Shag the Dimplex?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.455
You can still be quite funny.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.020
Still.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.002
Have you been reading my diary?

08:58.070 --> 08:59.731
- No.
- Why not?

09:00.273 --> 09:01.433
I would.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.791
<i>- They lived in Islington.</i>
<i>- Isn't that quite fashionable?</i>

09:28.434 --> 09:29.867
<i>Not then, dear.</i>

09:30.469 --> 09:31.834
<i>An apartment?</i>

09:33.272 --> 09:35.866
<i>Hardly. It was a cupboard.</i>

09:36.909 --> 09:38.206
All right?

09:38.778 --> 09:39.972
Smashing.

10:18.451 --> 10:22.387
- Can we go past the theater?
- Oh, no, I knew you'd say that. I knew.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.320
This is supposed to be my night!

10:24.390 --> 10:27.382
Actually, I just want to get out
of this fucking room.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.588
- I'd better have my Valium now.
- Give us a couple.

10:36.068 --> 10:38.593
Name in the paper again last night.

10:39.505 --> 10:42.963
Mrs. Sugden says
you're halfway to being a household word.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.504
Kenneth looks smart.

10:45.911 --> 10:48.243
Don't look at me. I'm not washed.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.781
Going out to supper.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.618
Candle-lit, probably.

10:58.724 --> 11:01.056
It's one function after another.

11:01.927 --> 11:04.157
They've got the world at their feet.

11:21.380 --> 11:25.077
When I was hanging them,
I kept thinking Schwitters.

11:25.584 --> 11:26.710
Wrong?

11:26.952 --> 11:29.785
Not entirely. You see, when I first started...

11:29.855 --> 11:34.087
- It would be in a cellar.
- Shut up. This is our be-kind-to-Kenny day.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.720
- The avalanche begins.
- We came together.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.491
Always the best way.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.960
- Hello.
- Well, Kenneth, your big day.

11:43.102 --> 11:46.196
- Joe, how are you?
- Where are these pictures?

11:47.573 --> 11:50.736
- Nice of you to come.
- We girls must stick together.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.310
I had a friend once in soft furnishings.

11:53.646 --> 11:57.377
The number of times
I trailed around the Ideal Home Exhibition...

11:57.450 --> 12:00.385
I've had an invitation
to the Lord Mayor of London.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.183
It's a banquet for those
eminent in the arts and sciences.

12:03.255 --> 12:04.313
Sounds exciting.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.483
It's because I've sold the film rights to <i>Loot.</i>

12:06.559 --> 12:09.392
I'm as rich as them,
so I'm invited to their rubbishy dinner.

12:09.462 --> 12:13.262
Joe, I believe they give you
some excellent turtle soup.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.259
Who's paying for all this?

12:15.334 --> 12:17.768
Success! Our first sale.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.198
Peggy's bought my <i>Cat Screen.</i>

12:22.341 --> 12:24.366
And I've almost sold another.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.504
- You've no need to.
- I like it.

12:28.647 --> 12:32.208
And you've no need to, either.
You don't owe him anything.

12:32.284 --> 12:34.445
Not anymore.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.816
You must leave him, Joe. You've got to.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.351
I can't.

12:39.892 --> 12:41.325
No, I couldn't.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.757
<i>And was he going to leave him?</i>

12:44.096 --> 12:46.030
<i>No shortage of offers.</i>

12:47.333 --> 12:48.732
<i>I don't know.</i>

12:49.034 --> 12:50.968
<i>Could he have left him?</i>

12:51.137 --> 12:53.605
<i>You're married. How can you tell?</i>

12:54.573 --> 12:56.302
What for? Sex?

12:57.042 --> 12:59.909
I suppose that's where they learnt it.
Therapy.

13:02.014 --> 13:04.448
- And what do you do?
- I'm the artist.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.779
Oh, really?

13:06.285 --> 13:09.049
Well, they're very unusual.

13:12.491 --> 13:14.288
Seems to be going well.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.952
Have we sold any more?

13:16.028 --> 13:18.724
No, but I'm getting lots of enthusiasm.

13:30.276 --> 13:32.904
- Isn't that Joe Orton?
- Yes.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.411
I loved <i>Loot!</i>

13:36.015 --> 13:38.210
The title was mine, actually.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.945
I gave him all his titles.
I'm his personal assistant.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.214
Really?

13:42.321 --> 13:45.119
I don't care for these at all.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.156
And what does that entail?

13:47.226 --> 13:51.026
It entails washing his underwear.
It entails taking his jumpers to Sketchley's.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.223
It entails poaching his fucking eggs.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.199
And it entails reading his manuscripts...

13:55.267 --> 13:58.031
only to find
everything I've thought or said is included.

13:58.103 --> 14:00.230
That must be very rewarding.

14:00.306 --> 14:03.537
If you're referring to the occasional bout
of mutual masturbation...

14:03.609 --> 14:05.839
no, it is not rewarding at all!

14:08.214 --> 14:10.341
I really do love my <i>Screen.</i>

14:11.016 --> 14:12.278
Honestly?

14:17.423 --> 14:19.448
"How do you justify your existence?"

14:19.525 --> 14:22.688
"I'm Joe Orton's friend."
As if it's a profession.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.630
Well, it's not a profession.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.197
It's a fucking full-time job.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.367
It's not a profession.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.564
<i>Was this customary?</i>

15:06.639 --> 15:10.735
<i>Oh, yes. According to the diary,</i>
<i>practically a daily occurrence.</i>

15:11.610 --> 15:13.475
<i>But you lost his diary.</i>

15:14.246 --> 15:15.235
<i>Yes.</i>

15:54.520 --> 15:56.420
No, I haven't seen him.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.714
I thought he left with you.

16:00.793 --> 16:05.287
No, Kenneth, of course I wanted it.
I wouldn't have bought it if I hadn't.

16:06.198 --> 16:08.666
I shall have it here, in my office.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.831
Yes, if he rings, I'll tell him.

16:13.572 --> 16:14.561
Bye.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.276
Then what?

16:22.081 --> 16:23.912
Then he did the same for me.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.348
Shall we eat? I'm starving.

16:25.417 --> 16:28.909
I write it all down, all the sex.
It's all in my diaries.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.017
How did he know you were here?

16:33.292 --> 16:35.157
You do, don't you?

16:35.494 --> 16:36.927
In that state.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.724
You know everything.

16:49.541 --> 16:50.633
Sorry.

16:52.277 --> 16:53.574
I'm sorry.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.310
I brought the melon.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.051
Any calls?

17:06.058 --> 17:07.286
I'm sorry.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.621
Shit!

17:17.935 --> 17:19.300
You found us.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.036
I just got here myself.

17:22.141 --> 17:24.871
This is my wife, Anthea. Ms. Ramsay.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.368
I think it is perhaps Peggy.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.078
We're working on the book together.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.617
Why don't you get Ms. Ramsay a drink?
White wine?

17:32.684 --> 17:34.879
White wine. You're not American.

17:35.687 --> 17:36.915
No, he is.

17:37.289 --> 17:39.587
John's American. He is, I'm not.

17:40.192 --> 17:43.787
Yes, I think I have
just about got that straight.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.832
We're working on the book together.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.631
These are the diaries.

17:58.844 --> 18:01.278
You must guard them with your life.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.412
Believe me.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.180
We can eat.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.919
Urinals figure largely, of course.

18:15.060 --> 18:16.186
Sugar?

18:16.261 --> 18:20.493
The more insalubrious the circumstances,
the more Joe seemed to enjoy it.

18:20.899 --> 18:21.991
Ginger?

18:22.067 --> 18:24.831
His first taste of sex,
or the first that he records...

18:24.903 --> 18:28.669
took place in a cinema lavatory in Leicester
at the age of 14.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.574
The film was <i>My Favorite Brunette.</i>

18:32.111 --> 18:34.170
Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.306
Quite.

18:37.382 --> 18:40.215
Joe says he came
all down the man's raincoat.

18:41.386 --> 18:42.751
Lovely melon.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.881
Thanks.

18:47.926 --> 18:52.590
I'll set Anthea to work transcribing these,
and then you can have the originals back.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.063
Do you type?

18:54.800 --> 18:58.497
It's tiresome, but sometime
we are going to have to talk about a fee.

18:58.570 --> 19:01.733
- I do have Joe's relatives to think about.
- Of course.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.699
He's all they have.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.568
What is this?

19:07.946 --> 19:11.905
This is the film script he was writing
for the Beatles that final summer.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.615
Darling Joe.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.948
I'm about to get Brian Epstein on the phone.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.548
When do you think
we could set up a meeting?

19:20.626 --> 19:23.117
Not there, Ms. Ramsay. On the Coast.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.930
When you say he's on the Coast, dear,
do you mean he's in Brighton?

19:31.336 --> 19:34.134
When he gets back
and has shaken the sand out of his shoes...

19:34.206 --> 19:36.470
perhaps you could get him to call me.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.168
Slut.

19:38.677 --> 19:39.735
Joe, dear.

19:40.145 --> 19:42.875
I've started on the script for the Beatles.

19:42.948 --> 19:45.883
I'm using some of a novel I wrote years ago.

19:46.285 --> 19:48.219
I'm surprised how good it is.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.653
You didn't write that. We wrote it.

19:50.856 --> 19:54.155
So what were you planning on doing?
Selling it to Warner Brothers?

19:54.226 --> 19:56.717
I wouldn't care, if you gave me some credit.

19:56.795 --> 19:59.423
If you only told people I helped you.

20:00.899 --> 20:04.460
- Tell the Beatles I help you.
- You're not being much help now.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.970
- Have you nothing to do?
- You do it!

20:07.039 --> 20:11.032
Try a spot of post-coital dusting yourself.
It always has to be me.

20:11.109 --> 20:12.474
Who's this?

20:13.412 --> 20:15.880
It's the police. It's one of your pickups.

20:16.014 --> 20:19.882
Your sex life has caught up with you.
Now you're going to have to pay.

20:27.459 --> 20:30.485
I thought you might like
a preview of my frock.

20:31.263 --> 20:35.461
It's for the firm's annual get-together
in a month or two's time.

20:37.703 --> 20:40.069
The actual venue is not definite yet...

20:40.205 --> 20:43.572
but it's thought to be
one of the leading London hotels.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.674
There's been some dispute
about the design.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.840
It's a floral motif, obviously, all hand-done.

20:51.183 --> 20:53.344
Only, I say these are roses.

20:53.819 --> 20:56.344
And Mr. Sugden will insist they're peonies.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.120
This could be a lily.

20:59.725 --> 21:03.183
- Looks more of a rhododendron to me.
- That's a thought.

21:03.629 --> 21:05.859
I'll go try that one out on Clifford.

21:07.733 --> 21:11.499
Do you notice I'm limping?
Spilled a hot drink down my dress.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.404
My vagina came up like a football.

21:34.526 --> 21:36.517
If you were successful...

21:37.029 --> 21:40.157
so successful
that you couldn't walk down the street...

21:40.232 --> 21:43.326
what would you do?
I'm thinking of the Beatles.

21:44.603 --> 21:46.161
I'd have a home.

21:48.507 --> 21:51.442
In the country. With servants.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.876
I wouldn't.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.080
I'd just shag everything in sight.

22:02.554 --> 22:03.543
No.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.423
Have a wank.

22:12.931 --> 22:15.058
I can't just have a wank.

22:15.701 --> 22:18.465
I need three days' notice to have a wank!

22:22.207 --> 22:24.334
You can just stand there and do it.

22:24.409 --> 22:26.707
Me, it's like organizing D-day.

22:27.145 --> 22:29.705
Forces have to be assembled,
magazines bought...

22:29.781 --> 22:32.648
the past dredged
for some suitably unsavory episode...

22:32.718 --> 22:36.745
the dogged thought of which
can still produce a faint flicker of desire.

22:36.822 --> 22:38.289
"Have a wank."

22:39.224 --> 22:41.624
Lt'd be easier to raise the <i>Titanic.</i>

22:41.693 --> 22:44.526
- And don't write it down.
- It's only my diary.

22:45.797 --> 22:48.925
- Do you read it?
- I've told you, no.

22:49.501 --> 22:53.232
My mom did. I used to have to put
the dirty bits in shorthand.

22:53.972 --> 22:56.202
Only time it's been of any use.

23:00.078 --> 23:01.773
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

23:01.847 --> 23:05.078
My secretary does shorthand,
but I'm on my own here.

23:09.421 --> 23:12.254
Well, dear,
you'll just have to use your imagination.

23:18.830 --> 23:21.424
Mother, didn't you once do shorthand?

23:21.967 --> 23:23.901
Yes, for about five minutes.

23:23.969 --> 23:25.994
It's this playwright John's working on.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.835
He went to secretarial school as a boy
and took shorthand.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.568
This is his diary.

23:30.776 --> 23:33.472
He keeps going into shorthand, you see.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.249
It was a long time ago, dear.
I never got the diploma.

23:38.316 --> 23:41.911
"Woke up late. Did not go to school.
Told Mom I felt sick.

23:41.987 --> 23:45.320
"When she'd gone to work,
I listened to <i>Housewives' Choice.</i>"

23:45.390 --> 23:47.950
"Then went into Mom's bedroom...

23:48.360 --> 23:51.727
"and arranged the dressing table mirrors...

23:52.063 --> 23:54.861
"and had a lovely, long, slow...

23:54.933 --> 23:55.922
"wink."

23:56.234 --> 23:58.600
"Wink." You sure that's an "i"?

23:59.004 --> 24:01.199
No, dear, I'm not sure at all.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.338
"Read all morning...

24:09.781 --> 24:11.840
"but got another hard-on.

24:13.051 --> 24:16.851
"Just putting soap on it when Mom came in.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.387
"Said I thought I had a spot coming.

24:21.326 --> 24:24.727
"Mom quiet all through meal."
I should think so.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.491
Does he go on like this?

24:26.565 --> 24:30.092
No, the early ones stopped
just when his life got interesting.

24:30.168 --> 24:32.466
Sounds quite interesting already.

24:32.571 --> 24:36.007
- Where's John?
- He's gone to Leicester to see the sister.

24:36.208 --> 24:39.177
<i>To look at the house</i>
<i>where Joe was brought up.</i>

24:48.720 --> 24:49.846
Hello.

24:50.255 --> 24:52.314
Was this the Orton house?

24:55.160 --> 24:57.253
Is this the...

24:58.163 --> 25:01.326
- I'm English. Ask me.
- Was this the house that Orton...

25:01.399 --> 25:02.889
<i>I hated that house.</i>

25:03.034 --> 25:05.264
There was no love in it.

25:05.437 --> 25:08.065
No wonder he couldn't wait to get out.

25:08.173 --> 25:11.438
In those days, if you were from Leicester
and wanted to be an actor...

25:11.510 --> 25:13.501
you had to get rid of your accent.

25:13.578 --> 25:15.512
Not that Mom knew anything
about the acting.

25:15.580 --> 25:18.879
<i>- She just wanted John to talk posh.</i>
<i>- You still call him John.</i>

25:18.950 --> 25:23.546
<i>That was his name when we were little.</i>
<i>It was after he was famous, he was Joe.</i>

25:23.755 --> 25:26.315
- Mrs. Lambert?
- Madame Lambert.

25:29.160 --> 25:33.028
- You are anxious to improve your diction?
- Yes, Madame Lambert.

25:33.431 --> 25:35.422
What is your chosen field?

25:36.268 --> 25:38.793
- I want to be an actor.
- Indeed.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.764
Leicester has produced some fine actors.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.967
Leicester is the hometown
of Richard Attenborough.

25:45.143 --> 25:46.132
Tea.

25:46.311 --> 25:49.439
Movement, elocution,
all these I can teach you.

25:49.514 --> 25:51.414
The arts proper to the stage.

25:51.483 --> 25:53.883
How to smoke a cigarette
with poise, elegance...

25:53.952 --> 25:56.011
and, above all, conviction.

25:56.087 --> 25:58.817
The powder compact
as a means of expression.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.585
Go to any production in the West End...

26:00.659 --> 26:04.117
and you will see these arts
brought to a pitch of perfection.

26:04.195 --> 26:07.596
But all that is as nothing...

26:08.466 --> 26:11.094
without the one essential requirement.

26:11.269 --> 26:13.897
- I have the money.
- Money? Pish!

26:14.406 --> 26:17.864
I'm not speaking of money.
I'm speaking of talent.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.808
Judging by what you've read,
you have no talent.

26:22.347 --> 26:24.212
No talent whatsoever.

26:24.449 --> 26:27.316
- I still want to learn.
- Bravo!

26:27.786 --> 26:32.052
No marks for talent.
Full marks for Dunkirk spirit.

26:40.465 --> 26:41.796
Bloody plays.

26:41.866 --> 26:44.334
Mom didn't have much of a horizon.

26:44.603 --> 26:48.699
She'd have liked him a civil servant.
A suit every day of his life.

26:48.940 --> 26:52.103
Next time, tell them
to provide you with a costume!

26:53.345 --> 26:56.280
Using our bedspread. Wicked!

26:56.715 --> 26:57.841
You'll clean it!

27:00.352 --> 27:02.377
Coloring it with distemper.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.547
Ruined, bloody ruined.

27:05.023 --> 27:08.550
I bet Dirk Bogarde
didn't distemper his mother's bedspread!

27:09.661 --> 27:10.958
Bloody disgusting.

27:18.036 --> 27:20.004
And get some clothes on.

27:21.039 --> 27:24.531
Walking around like Sambo.
Don't know where to look.

27:39.057 --> 27:40.149
What?

27:40.558 --> 27:42.856
There's somebody at the door.
Fetch us me teeth.

27:54.739 --> 27:57.139
It'll be the gas man. I never paid.

28:00.278 --> 28:01.768
Good afternoon.

28:02.113 --> 28:04.775
I'm a Council official.
I've come about your lad.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.477
Why? What's he done?
What have you done?

28:07.552 --> 28:10.817
Shakespeare's what he's done.
He's taken a very good part.

28:10.889 --> 28:14.256
He's favorably impressed a prominent
member of the Education Committee.

28:14.325 --> 28:16.156
Yes, he'd have a bedspread.

28:18.563 --> 28:19.962
Good afternoon.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.329
- Who's this?
- This is my husband. Ignore him.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.631
- Your son is a born actor.
- An actor?

28:25.704 --> 28:28.036
But he went to Clark's College.
He's done shorthand.

28:28.106 --> 28:31.269
- He had a badge in his blazer.
- This boy will never make a typist.

28:31.342 --> 28:33.310
- He can do 40 words a minute.
- Shut up!

28:33.378 --> 28:35.471
No, he must take up a dramatic career.

28:35.547 --> 28:39.506
But I've sacrificed all down the line
in order for him to land a job in an office.

28:39.584 --> 28:43.748
No, Mrs. Orton, your son must go in
for a scholarship to RADA.

28:44.155 --> 28:47.613
- RADA?
- The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.151
RADA?

28:51.429 --> 28:53.829
The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

28:54.666 --> 28:55.792
RADA.

28:58.103 --> 29:00.663
"Do you know who I'm looking for, Smee?"

29:00.739 --> 29:03.299
"No, tell me again, Captain."

29:03.575 --> 29:06.635
"I'm looking for a boy, Smee."

29:08.079 --> 29:10.138
"What kind of boy, Captain?"

29:10.582 --> 29:13.551
"A wicked boy. A heartless boy.

29:13.651 --> 29:16.711
"A boy who never ate his rice pudding."

29:17.055 --> 29:20.320
"Oh, horror! Can there be such boys?"

29:20.558 --> 29:22.219
"Aye, there can.

29:22.494 --> 29:26.555
"It was a boy like that that cut off my arm...

29:26.765 --> 29:28.960
"and fed it to the crocodiles.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.397
"His name...

29:30.468 --> 29:33.437
"was Peter Pan."

29:45.450 --> 29:48.578
You've had some amateur experience,
I gather, Mr. Orton.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.347
Tell us about it.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.690
I started off in <i>Richard III.</i>

29:54.159 --> 29:55.421
As what?

29:56.227 --> 29:57.592
A messenger.

29:59.964 --> 30:03.331
That was most original.
You've done very well.

30:04.402 --> 30:06.632
Yes, very nice and loud.

30:17.615 --> 30:21.813
"O, that this too too solid flesh
would melt...

30:21.986 --> 30:25.319
- "thaw and resolve itself into a dew!"
- Rather old.

30:25.423 --> 30:28.620
- "Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd..."
- Not as old as he looks.

30:28.693 --> 30:31.093
"...his canon 'gainst self-slaughter!"

30:32.730 --> 30:35.255
It's useful to have somebody as old as that.

30:35.733 --> 30:37.394
Just for casting.

30:38.169 --> 30:41.730
We seem to be taking
practically anything that stands up.

30:45.243 --> 30:46.733
At least he's got the coat.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.688
- What are you?
- Cats, miss.

30:58.957 --> 31:01.619
Let's change the exercise slightly.

31:02.327 --> 31:04.090
I've got a cat now.

31:05.797 --> 31:08.288
Here you are. Catch it.

31:58.983 --> 32:02.885
Movement, enunciation, breath control.

32:03.288 --> 32:06.052
It's all so wildly dated, don't you agree?

32:07.091 --> 32:10.891
- Yes, it is.
- Still, I suppose the beginners find it useful.

32:11.562 --> 32:13.757
- Are you new to London?
- Hardly.

32:14.966 --> 32:18.458
A small legacy enabled me to spend
several weekends at the Strand Palace.

32:18.536 --> 32:22.199
- Hotels are a closed book to me.
- You'll like the Strand Palace.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.707
Perhaps we might venture there one evening
for coffee.

32:24.776 --> 32:25.902
Ready?

32:25.977 --> 32:28.878
We're off over to South Bank. The festival.

32:29.514 --> 32:31.414
Yes, it might be amusing, I suppose.

32:31.482 --> 32:34.610
Yes, the plebs and their simple pleasures.

32:36.087 --> 32:38.112
What did you ask him for?

32:49.133 --> 32:50.361
Come on.

33:02.513 --> 33:03.946
"Let us go then, you and I...

33:04.015 --> 33:06.415
"when the evening is spread out
against the sky...

33:06.484 --> 33:09.180
"like a patient etherised upon a table."

33:12.390 --> 33:13.652
Come on.

33:18.863 --> 33:21.093
You know, some of these people are...

33:22.467 --> 33:25.231
- having sexual intercourse.
- Fucking, you mean.

33:25.303 --> 33:28.966
What did you expect?
Many of them are from Australia.

33:31.142 --> 33:32.336
Come on.

33:44.922 --> 33:47.186
<i>What was the Festival of Britain?</i>

33:47.759 --> 33:49.954
<i>That was when it all came off the ration.</i>

33:50.194 --> 33:52.185
<i>You mean food and things?</i>

33:52.330 --> 33:55.231
<i>Life, dear. Sex. Everything.</i>

33:56.434 --> 33:58.163
<i>Only it didn't, of course.</i>

34:04.575 --> 34:08.341
I wish he'd never come.
I wanted it to be just us.

34:14.118 --> 34:15.710
- No.
- Why?

34:15.820 --> 34:19.585
- Not here. People are looking.
- Fuck people.

34:19.924 --> 34:21.949
You can't live like that, John.

34:22.025 --> 34:24.893
- I want to take things gradually.
- I don't.

34:25.496 --> 34:27.521
You don't know what life's like.

34:27.697 --> 34:30.757
I'm not going to find out at this rate, either.

35:36.234 --> 35:38.725
- Thank you.
- Cheap clothes suit you.

35:38.803 --> 35:41.363
It's because you're from the gutter.

35:45.776 --> 35:48.006
I said I'll move in with Janet.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.744
This is the room.

35:54.685 --> 35:57.848
I'm only looking. I'm fixed up elsewhere.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.460
Is it a northern light?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.030
Never heard any complaints.

36:09.100 --> 36:12.035
Of course, it's in dire need of decorating.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.594
What is that smell?

36:15.072 --> 36:19.008
Air freshener.
The carpet came from Reading originally.

36:22.046 --> 36:23.707
Friends, are you?

36:24.015 --> 36:26.882
- Students.
- I've nothing against friendship.

36:27.385 --> 36:31.151
It's the most wonderful thing in the world,
within reason.

36:31.422 --> 36:33.049
I'm only looking.

36:33.524 --> 36:36.391
- They say Islington's coming up.
- It is.

36:36.661 --> 36:40.927
They've turned the greengrocer's into
an antique shop, and the pub is silent.

36:40.998 --> 36:42.590
What do you think?

36:43.134 --> 36:46.069
I think I shall keep an open mind.

37:05.756 --> 37:07.883
Help yourself. Here.

37:17.969 --> 37:21.928
- Where did you get them?
- I nicked them while he wasn't looking.

37:30.314 --> 37:32.839
- You can type?
- Forty words a minute.

37:33.551 --> 37:37.248
- Neither of us seems to have family photos.
- I'm an orphan.

37:37.455 --> 37:39.685
I always wanted to be an orphan.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.282
I could have been
if it hadn't been for my parents.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.624
My mother died when I was a boy.

37:45.396 --> 37:48.024
She was stung on the tongue by a wasp.

37:48.766 --> 37:51.667
One minute
we were just sitting down to breakfast...

37:51.736 --> 37:53.670
ten minutes later, she was dead.

37:53.738 --> 37:55.933
- That still leaves your dad.
- Him?

37:56.374 --> 37:59.002
He put his head in the gas oven
when I was 18.

37:59.076 --> 38:01.567
I came down one morning
and found him lying there.

38:01.646 --> 38:03.443
So I switched the gas off, had a shave...

38:03.514 --> 38:06.005
made some tea, and called the ambulance.
In that order.

38:06.083 --> 38:09.018
I understand.
My dad always took a back seat.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.951
My novels.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.281
Anybody can act.

38:14.358 --> 38:16.417
All these books. I'll never catch up.

38:16.494 --> 38:19.486
I'm a cultivated person, John.
You'll find it rubs off.

38:19.563 --> 38:20.962
Dictionaries.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.728
- Can you spell?
- Yes, but not accurately.

38:28.372 --> 38:33.002
- I don't understand Shakespeare.
- We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

38:33.377 --> 38:36.471
Talking of Shakespeare,
we're missing the Queen.

38:56.434 --> 38:59.494
<i>I here present unto you Queen Elizabeth...</i>

39:00.171 --> 39:01.604
<i>your undoubted Queen.</i>

39:01.672 --> 39:02.661
Improves the contrast.

39:02.740 --> 39:06.301
<i>Wherefore all you who are come this day...</i>

39:06.844 --> 39:08.869
<i>to do your homage and service...</i>

39:09.280 --> 39:11.339
<i>are you willing to do the same?</i>

39:16.520 --> 39:18.886
This is a new experience for me.

39:20.224 --> 39:21.350
Yes?

39:21.992 --> 39:23.357
Television.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.387
I've never seen it before.

39:27.431 --> 39:30.594
<i>... to govern the peoples</i>
<i>of the United Kingdom...</i>

39:30.668 --> 39:32.101
Do you like it?

39:34.372 --> 39:35.464
This?

39:38.876 --> 39:40.241
Television.

39:42.813 --> 39:47.614
<i>... the other territories according to</i>
<i>their respective laws and customs?</i>

39:48.219 --> 39:50.380
<i>I solemnly promise so to do.</i>

40:11.041 --> 40:13.305
It's the beginning of a new era.

41:06.297 --> 41:10.199
<i>Thence goes Queen Elizabeth</i>
<i>to sit in King Edward's Chair...</i>

41:10.568 --> 41:13.731
<i>for the most sacred rite of her anointing.</i>

41:24.615 --> 41:26.776
Are you up here helping John?

41:26.851 --> 41:28.375
Holding his hand.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.614
Did Kenneth ever come up to Leicester?

41:33.591 --> 41:35.149
Did you like him?

41:36.327 --> 41:38.295
I didn't dislike him.

41:38.362 --> 41:40.887
I could see what he saw in Joe, after all.

41:41.532 --> 41:44.399
I couldn't really see what Joe saw in him.

41:44.869 --> 41:47.303
Of course, I didn't know what went on.

41:47.404 --> 41:49.531
Upstairs, come on.

41:51.375 --> 41:54.902
Did you know that Joe was that way?

41:57.014 --> 41:58.982
- Yes.
- You didn't.

41:59.049 --> 42:01.813
I did and I didn't.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.620
The way you do, don't you?

42:04.955 --> 42:09.358
Mind you, at our Douglas' wedding,
Mom found him in bed with a bridesmaid.

42:11.428 --> 42:14.158
So you see? It's as I say.

42:14.632 --> 42:17.032
He couldn't have learned it in Leicester.

42:17.101 --> 42:18.693
He was corrupted.

42:19.904 --> 42:22.065
Joe wanted something from Kenneth.

42:22.139 --> 42:25.074
And Kenneth wanted something from Joe.
It's not corruption.

42:25.609 --> 42:27.076
It's collaboration.

42:27.611 --> 42:30.739
He was born that way,
or else it was my mom.

42:30.814 --> 42:32.338
Women don't care anyway.

42:32.416 --> 42:35.817
- I don't care what men get up to.
- I don't care where they put it.

42:35.886 --> 42:38.150
As long as they don't put it there.

42:38.222 --> 42:40.190
Didn't I say upstairs?

42:40.691 --> 42:42.955
A taste of their own medicine.

42:45.362 --> 42:49.355
The lavatories shocked me a bit
when I read his diary, but...

42:50.601 --> 42:52.660
A boy stopped me the other day...

42:52.736 --> 42:56.365
and said, "I want to thank you for
your brother's plays." So what do you do?

42:56.440 --> 42:59.136
Yes, I feel quite grateful
for his plays myself.

42:59.677 --> 43:02.669
Personally, I think a lot of that is made up.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.640
- What?
- The toilets.

43:06.884 --> 43:09.546
You have to go into all that, do you?

43:12.790 --> 43:15.122
It all seems a bit unnecessary to me.

43:15.225 --> 43:18.820
The lawn mower is not unnecessary.
The Fiesta is not unnecessary.

43:18.896 --> 43:21.330
You ought to be grateful
we get money from his plays.

43:21.398 --> 43:24.128
Grateful? I work, too, you know.

43:24.835 --> 43:27.804
This isn't royalties.
This is plumbing money, this is.

43:27.871 --> 43:30.362
He's nothing in Leicester, Joe Orton.

43:31.809 --> 43:33.276
- Ken?
- What?

43:34.812 --> 43:37.713
You know you could be
put in prison for this.

43:37.781 --> 43:39.248
So could you.

43:40.217 --> 43:41.445
No.

43:42.953 --> 43:44.716
I'm the innocent party.

43:52.730 --> 43:54.698
No, I want to get on.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.833
Writing, John, is one-tenth inspiration,
nine-tenths...

43:58.902 --> 44:00.529
Masturbation.

44:39.810 --> 44:42.506
That's a library book.
You should respect books.

44:42.579 --> 44:46.015
I respect them more than you.
You just take them for granted.

44:50.521 --> 44:52.887
Shit, I'll never catch up.

44:53.257 --> 44:56.522
So what's this?
We are halfway through a novel.

44:57.828 --> 44:59.227
You are, you mean.

45:00.431 --> 45:02.626
It's a collaboration, dear.

45:04.568 --> 45:05.865
We've written it together.

45:05.936 --> 45:07.767
- Stop it, I'm reading.
- You're not.

45:07.838 --> 45:09.738
- Test me, then.
- What on?

45:09.807 --> 45:11.138
Mythology.

45:12.509 --> 45:14.238
Who is the father of Oedipus?

45:14.311 --> 45:16.245
- Laius.
- Who is his mother?

45:16.747 --> 45:18.214
Fuck his mother.

45:22.619 --> 45:24.086
<i>Boy Hairdresser.</i>

45:25.055 --> 45:26.352
Nice title.

45:26.990 --> 45:28.981
I've shown it to one or two...

45:29.660 --> 45:31.855
selected colleagues...

45:33.030 --> 45:35.498
- and we laughed.
- You're kidding.

45:36.233 --> 45:38.030
We had a real chuckle.

45:39.503 --> 45:42.438
The trouble is that normal sex...

45:43.073 --> 45:45.200
is still a novelty for most people...

45:45.576 --> 45:47.100
in book form.

45:48.112 --> 45:49.875
A book such as yours...

45:50.314 --> 45:53.750
- which very wittily...
- We thought it was witty.

45:55.486 --> 45:59.650
...explores the byways of sexuality...

46:00.858 --> 46:02.826
is ahead of its time.

46:04.962 --> 46:07.328
We are a very conservative firm.

46:13.971 --> 46:16.030
Isn't one of the directors T.S. Eliot?

46:16.907 --> 46:18.397
Yes, that's right.

46:18.475 --> 46:20.272
Is he in the building?

46:25.182 --> 46:27.150
Thursday. Yes, he is.

46:27.217 --> 46:30.482
Fancy, John,
we're under the same roof as T.S. Eliot.

46:34.491 --> 46:36.823
He wants to know which is his chair.

46:40.130 --> 46:41.358
This one.

46:47.538 --> 46:50.302
Yes, well, thank you very much
for letting us see this.

46:50.374 --> 46:54.777
You can keep it a little longer if you want.
Show it to a few more friends.

46:55.145 --> 46:56.635
Thank you, no.

46:59.516 --> 47:02.451
And remember, next time you see Mr. Eliot...

47:03.086 --> 47:05.919
tell him he has two devoted fans
in Islington...

47:05.989 --> 47:08.890
who think <i>The Waste Land</i>
is a real knockout.

47:12.796 --> 47:13.820
Never mind.

47:13.897 --> 47:16.889
At least you can say
you sat in the same chair as T.S. Eliot.

47:16.967 --> 47:19.492
Yes, I'm never gonna wipe my bum again.

47:20.304 --> 47:23.762
Why did you leave all the talking to me?
It's your book as much as mine.

47:23.841 --> 47:26.036
I'm shy. It's not my territory.

47:27.978 --> 47:29.741
This is dead-center me.

47:32.549 --> 47:33.846
Nice bum.

47:33.917 --> 47:35.942
- He heard that.
- So what?

47:36.587 --> 47:38.054
Now you're shy.

47:41.258 --> 47:44.159
This is Mr. Halliwell.

47:46.563 --> 47:47.962
Really?

47:48.832 --> 47:50.925
Doesn't knock on my box one bit.

47:52.502 --> 47:54.231
He's got a big one.

47:56.974 --> 48:00.137
- How do you know?
- It's written all over his face.

48:03.647 --> 48:06.810
- Look at the package on that.
- Where?

48:08.418 --> 48:10.716
- We're on.
- I didn't see anything. What did he do?

48:10.787 --> 48:12.516
What do you want, a telegram? Come on!

48:24.034 --> 48:26.468
He's built like a brick shithouse.

48:27.804 --> 48:31.262
- He's probably a policeman.
- Yes, I know. Isn't he wonderful?

48:50.394 --> 48:52.760
We've got tickets for the Proms.

49:14.217 --> 49:16.617
All right. What's your name?

49:17.120 --> 49:19.611
- What do you mean, what's my name?
- Mine's Kevin.

49:19.690 --> 49:21.180
Mine's Howard.

49:21.725 --> 49:24.159
- That's a poncey name.
- Patrick, then.

49:24.361 --> 49:27.228
Catholic, are you? What do you do?

49:27.531 --> 49:30.329
- I don't know. What do you do?
- I'm a fitter, car components.

49:30.400 --> 49:31.492
I'm a dog handler.

49:31.568 --> 49:34.696
On an individual basis,
or are you a tool of a large organization?

49:34.771 --> 49:38.707
I'm so shit scared, I don't know
if I'll be able to do anything.

49:39.676 --> 49:42.144
We don't want to let this
make us late for the Proms.

49:42.212 --> 49:44.578
Listen, sweetheart, which do you prefer?

49:44.648 --> 49:46.616
Him or Sir Malcolm Sargent?

50:00.597 --> 50:03.259
Hello. My name's Kevin.

50:03.767 --> 50:05.962
- Mine's Kenneth.
- Mine's Kenneth, too.

50:06.036 --> 50:08.596
- Shit.
- Only, my friends call me Patrick.

50:08.672 --> 50:10.401
We're all friends here.

50:18.382 --> 50:19.849
Do you kiss?

51:08.198 --> 51:10.291
I don't think he likes me.

51:11.635 --> 51:13.296
You like him, don't you?

51:13.503 --> 51:14.663
Sure.

51:17.841 --> 51:19.001
Kiss him.

51:49.506 --> 51:51.667
<i>And so, 10 years passed.</i>

51:52.175 --> 51:55.542
<i>- Not like that.</i>
<i>- No, silly, not like that.</i>

51:56.580 --> 52:00.880
<i>Nothing happened. Looking back on it,</i>
<i>I suppose it was some kind of preparation.</i>

52:01.685 --> 52:03.448
<i>An education, maybe.</i>

52:03.520 --> 52:06.489
<i>Well, if it seemed like that to Joe,</i>
<i>it can't have done to Ken.</i>

52:06.556 --> 52:09.116
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- His hair was falling out.</i>

52:09.192 --> 52:10.352
<i>God, I know the feeling.</i>

52:10.427 --> 52:13.157
<i>And whereas he'd stopped writing,</i>
<i>Joe had started.</i>

52:13.230 --> 52:16.199
<i>Still, they were both failures,</i>
<i>so it didn't matter.</i>

52:16.266 --> 52:18.826
<i>- It didn't matter yet.</i>
<i>- Quite.</i>

52:44.194 --> 52:47.561
You want rice pudding
with the sardines or separate?

52:47.998 --> 52:49.192
With.

52:56.773 --> 52:57.831
Jam?

52:58.808 --> 52:59.900
No.

53:10.687 --> 53:13.520
Mozart was dead by the time he was my age.

53:14.024 --> 53:16.925
- I'm not even young anymore.
- What about me?

53:17.394 --> 53:18.884
You never were.

53:24.668 --> 53:27.796
I can't see
how we are ever going to make our mark...

53:29.072 --> 53:31.302
defacing library books.

53:59.169 --> 54:03.071
- You didn't tell me one of them was a nancy.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Cunliffe?

54:03.240 --> 54:05.299
The bald one, Miss Batersby.

54:05.375 --> 54:08.640
A homosexual. A shirtlifter.

54:09.646 --> 54:12.479
- In Islington?
- Haven't you noticed?

54:12.949 --> 54:15.349
Large areas of the borough
are being restored...

54:15.418 --> 54:17.443
and painted Thames green.

54:19.689 --> 54:21.281
Noel Road.

54:21.791 --> 54:25.227
This calls for a little detective work,
Miss Batersby.

54:33.470 --> 54:36.200
"Fucked by Monty." Indeed!

54:37.707 --> 54:40.073
Men died! Died!

54:50.587 --> 54:52.145
Registration:

54:52.589 --> 54:53.988
K-Y-R...

54:54.524 --> 54:56.253
4-5-0.

54:57.927 --> 54:59.861
The above-mentioned vehicle...

55:00.263 --> 55:03.460
appears to be derelict and abandoned...

55:03.833 --> 55:05.596
in Noel Road...

55:07.470 --> 55:10.064
and I have been given to understand...

55:10.607 --> 55:12.973
you are the owner thereof.

55:13.610 --> 55:15.578
"But before enforcing remedies...

55:15.645 --> 55:19.775
"I give you the opportunity
to remove the vehicle from the highway."

55:20.216 --> 55:21.877
The little prick.

55:22.519 --> 55:24.885
Unzip our trusty Remington, John.

55:24.954 --> 55:28.048
We will piss on this person
from a great height.

55:29.426 --> 55:30.950
"Humber Hawk" indeed.

55:31.461 --> 55:35.989
Dear sir,
thank you for your dreary little letter...

55:36.066 --> 55:37.795
- "Dismal" is better.
- "Dismal," then.

55:37.867 --> 55:39.494
I should like to know...

55:39.569 --> 55:43.699
who provided you
with this mysterious information.

55:43.873 --> 55:47.274
"Furnished" is better than "provided."
It's more municipal in tone.

55:48.411 --> 55:52.575
You will note the typing,
Miss Batersby, is the same.

55:54.150 --> 55:55.913
Our book jacket...

55:56.820 --> 55:58.378
their letter.

56:00.924 --> 56:02.858
Got you, my beauties.

56:03.727 --> 56:08.221
This is the novel <i>Clouds of Witness</i>
by the noted authoress Dorothy L. Sayers.

56:08.998 --> 56:13.332
Could you read what the accused
have written on the flap of the jacket?

56:13.703 --> 56:17.002
"When little Betty McDree says
she has been interfered with...

56:17.073 --> 56:18.870
"her mother first laughs.

56:18.942 --> 56:22.309
"'Lt is only something the kitty
has picked up off the television.'

56:22.379 --> 56:24.438
"But when sorting through the laundry...

56:24.514 --> 56:27.677
"Mrs. McDree discovers
a new pair of knickers are missing...

56:27.751 --> 56:29.412
"she thinks again.

56:29.786 --> 56:32.482
"Her mother takes little Betty
to the police station...

56:32.555 --> 56:34.352
"where to everyone's surprise...

56:34.424 --> 56:37.882
"she identifies P.C. Brecken-Coolidge
as her attacker.

56:38.795 --> 56:41.889
"A search is made
of the women's police barracks.

56:41.998 --> 56:44.558
"What is found there
is a seven-inch phallus...

56:44.634 --> 56:47.762
"and a pair of knickers
of the type used by Betty.

56:47.837 --> 56:50.567
"All looks black for kindly P.C. Coolidge.

56:51.241 --> 56:54.768
"This is one of the most enthralling stories
ever written by Miss Sayers.

56:54.844 --> 56:57.142
"Read it behind closed doors...

56:58.915 --> 57:01.975
"and have a good shit
while you're reading it."

57:05.622 --> 57:09.718
The probation officer has suggested
that you are both frustrated authors.

57:11.561 --> 57:13.586
If you are so clever at making fun...

57:13.663 --> 57:16.393
of what more talented people have written...

57:16.466 --> 57:18.991
you should have a shot
at writing books yourselves.

57:19.068 --> 57:21.628
You won't find that such a pushover.

57:21.971 --> 57:24.963
Sheer malice and destruction,
the pair of you.

57:25.241 --> 57:27.368
I sentence you both to six months.

57:27.444 --> 57:29.503
- Fucking A.
- It was your idea.

57:29.946 --> 57:31.777
But I'm the youngest.

57:35.952 --> 57:38.182
<i>Prison worked wonders for Joe.</i>

57:38.421 --> 57:39.820
<i>And being a man, of course...</i>

57:39.889 --> 57:42.881
<i>he made out it was much more of an ordeal</i>
<i>than in fact it was.</i>

57:42.959 --> 57:46.360
<i>- Where did he go?</i>
<i>- Brixton, for about five minutes...</i>

57:46.429 --> 57:48.954
<i>then one of those open places in Sussex.</i>

57:49.032 --> 57:52.399
<i>Quite near my health farm, actually,</i>
<i>and with much the same effect.</i>

57:52.469 --> 57:54.801
<i>Though at rather less expense.</i>

57:55.171 --> 57:56.160
<i>Yes.</i>

57:56.539 --> 57:59.007
<i>And at my place you don't get psychiatry.</i>

57:59.075 --> 58:01.043
What about your parents?

58:06.716 --> 58:09.207
Dead. Both of them.

58:09.452 --> 58:11.386
When I was a little kiddie.

58:11.454 --> 58:13.115
I'm an orphan.

58:15.592 --> 58:17.856
The guy I share a room with...

58:18.161 --> 58:19.321
Ken...

58:19.896 --> 58:22.160
he cracks on he's the orphan.

58:23.299 --> 58:24.823
Don't you believe him.

58:25.268 --> 58:26.792
He reckons he got up one morning...

58:26.870 --> 58:28.997
and found his dad
with his head in the gas oven.

58:29.072 --> 58:31.165
Didn't even call the ambulance.

58:35.111 --> 58:36.908
How is he, by the way?

58:40.049 --> 58:41.846
That was your mother.

58:42.051 --> 58:44.485
Tell me about your father.

58:45.154 --> 58:48.214
There's nothing to tell. I was 18...

58:49.325 --> 58:53.022
I came down one morning and found him
with his head in the gas oven.

58:53.897 --> 58:55.990
You called the ambulance, naturally?

58:56.065 --> 58:57.396
Oh, eventually.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.295
I made a cup of tea first.

58:59.802 --> 59:01.827
He was quite plainly dead.

59:02.539 --> 59:05.133
- You weren't fond of him.
- Not particularly.

59:05.642 --> 59:07.803
You're fond of your roommate.

59:08.111 --> 59:10.136
We're everything to one another.

59:11.347 --> 59:12.939
Sleep together, do you?

59:13.983 --> 59:15.041
No...

59:16.052 --> 59:17.451
but we have sex.

59:19.055 --> 59:20.317
Are you sure?

59:21.457 --> 59:22.446
Yes.

59:22.859 --> 59:25.327
You don't mean you want to have sex?

59:26.262 --> 59:28.457
No, we do.

59:29.832 --> 59:34.098
But your friend's not like that, is he?
He's married, he's got a child.

59:34.170 --> 59:36.661
So you're surprised, are you?

59:40.209 --> 59:41.506
Not really.

59:42.612 --> 59:45.046
This may come as a shock to you...

59:45.548 --> 59:47.641
but I suspect your friend...

59:48.518 --> 59:50.645
may be homosexual.

59:51.888 --> 59:53.116
Jesus!

59:53.823 --> 59:57.020
And there I am,
sleeping in the same room with him.

59:57.927 --> 01:00:01.260
You mentioned your wife.
Where is she now?

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:04.357
The last I heard,
she'd taken the kid to Lyme Regis.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.935
Try and team up with them again.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.369
Make a fresh start.

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:13.733
Don't you worry.

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:25.218
Not too Spartan, is it?

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.117
On the contrary, a room of one's own.

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:37.726
<i>Prison gives a writer credentials.</i>

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.234
<i>Everyone else, it takes them away.</i>

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.867
<i>It was the first time in 10 years</i>
<i>they'd been split up.</i>

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:47.807
<i>- So prison was a taste of freedom.</i>
<i>- For Joe.</i>

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:49.906
When did you do this?

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:52.675
- I haven't seen this.
- It's a radio play.

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:54.478
I did it on my own in prison.

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:57.041
- I've sent it to the BBC.
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.055
I could help you write a proper letter.
You'll never hear back.

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:01.590
I already have.

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:12.466
"We had a little room...

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:17.295
"and our life was made quite comfortable
by the National Assistance Board.

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:21.736
"We had a lot of friends
of all creeds and colors...

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:24.041
"and no circumstances at all.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.180
"We were happy enough.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.042
"We were young."

01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:33.583
<i>"I was 17 and he was 23.</i>

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.951
"You can't do better for yourself than that,
can you?

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:38.891
"We were bosom friends."

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:42.293
- "I hope I haven't shocked you."
- "As close as that?"

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.128
"We had separate beds."

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:46.597
"He was a stickler for appearances.

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:49.764
"But we spent every night
in each other's company.

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:52.535
"It was the reason
we never got any work done.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:55.109
"I used to base my life around him."

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.573
- "Don't often get that, do you?"
- "No."

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:00.111
"He had personality."

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:04.211
Could we make that line read
"stickler for convention"?

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:07.153
"His mentality wasn't fully developed.

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:10.120
"He was bound to make good
sooner or later."

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.001
<i>I knew nothing about him</i>
<i>when he walked in.</i>

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:21.502
Mr. Orton...

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:24.232
- Hello.
- Hello, dear.

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:27.805
<i>I thought the radio play was derivative.</i>
<i>I said so.</i>

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.868
<i>- Did he mind?</i>
<i>- Not at all.</i>

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:33.012
I'm writing a better one for the stage.

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:36.216
Mr. Orton, that would be gorgeous.

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:43.384
Would it be rude to inquire
how you're managing to live?

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:46.556
National Assistance, £3.10 a week.

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:49.461
I'm afraid I've just come out of jail.

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:51.027
Excellent.

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:53.936
The papers will love all that.

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:04.143
This is what we call an advance.

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:08.915
It means that when you finish
the new play you're writing...

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:11.613
the one that's going to be better...

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:14.346
you bring it along and show me.

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:20.786
John Orton.

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:22.662
Don't like that.

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:25.893
Sounds too much like John Osborne.

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:29.061
Are you attached to John as a name?

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:30.496
No.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.967
Try to think of another one, dear.

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:36.940
Next time I come...

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:39.040
can I bring my friend?

01:03:47.256 --> 01:03:51.522
Right around the back, and when you
hit the middle of the sofa, lunge.

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:52.822
Yes.

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:54.692
- Is that better, Joe?
- Fine.

01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:57.665
- Is the view better for you?
- It's better for me.

01:03:57.733 --> 01:03:59.758
Except, it's not our play.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:06.736
You're making it into a cheap sex farce.
That's not what we wrote.

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:07.798
We?

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:10.345
- Ken thinks...
- You wrote this play, I'm directing it.

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:14.076
I don't give a damn what this refugee
from a secondhand clothes shop thinks.

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:16.778
I will not have him in rehearsal.
It fucks up the actors.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:19.083
- He's a friend.
- After all, it's your play.

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:20.645
It is your play, isn't it?

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:43.006
You just want to be liked.

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.808
That's your trouble.

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:49.177
Am I 25 or 26?

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:52.248
For publicity purposes.

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:56.090
Peggy's been pestering me
for some undisputed facts.

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:59.559
Why not tell the truth? 31, "Joe."

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:01.625
I can't put 31.

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:04.390
I don't look 31.

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:07.102
Besides, 31 is a well-known bus.

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:09.503
Married or single?

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:12.605
Married...

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:14.807
Divorced.

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:16.667
One kid.

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.658
I've dedicated it to you.

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.491
What more do you want?

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.693
Did you put my full name?

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:39.792
Or just Kenneth?

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:45.864
I'll put your phone number, too, if you want.

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:51.841
Why now?

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:54.544
You're not ashamed of me?

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:04.218
Hair loss is often thought of
as a sign of sexual potency.

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:06.554
Does your experience bear that out?

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:10.457
More people wear wigs
than is commonly realized.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.027
Trades union leaders...

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.398
sporting personalities...

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:18.330
members of the royal family.

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:25.105
It's better than the beret.

01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:27.576
Shall we keep it on?

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:31.110
Yes, I think so.

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:34.979
I shall wear it to our first night.

01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:38.683
It'll be £70.

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:42.729
£70?

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:44.899
This is on me.

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:48.230
And this is on me.

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:55.473
I'm not calling you "Joe."
You sound like rough trade.

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:59.614
To me, you're John. You'll always be John.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:03.211
For Ken and Joe...

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:05.916
opportunity knocked.

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:27.365
I just want to see if it works.

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:29.637
What?

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:31.109
The wig.

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:33.948
I'm going to end up like you.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:35.706
Yes.

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:37.278
Stay there.

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:49.456
All right?

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:19.457
You got the time?

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.920
Not right now.

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:28.060
Hey.

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:34.542
You see the fellow in the wig?

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:37.270
He's wanting it, ask him.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:40.642
Oh, fear.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:52.054
Go on.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.296
Got a match?

01:08:59.268 --> 01:09:01.292
- What?
- A light.

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:08.910
- I'm afraid I haven't.
- Pity.

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:14.881
I was thinking of popping in
for a Jimmy Riddle.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.246
You know.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.157
It works.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:31.091
- It really works.
- Go on, get in there.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.191
I daren't.

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:34.395
- Do you want me to come?
- No.

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:43.705
Go on.

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:55.286
<i>They are called cottages, you know.</i>
<i>Gentlemen's lavs.</i>

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:58.186
<i>In the States, it's tearooms.</i>

01:09:58.661 --> 01:09:59.958
<i>Really?</i>

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:03.295
<i>In England, tearooms</i>
<i>are something quite different.</i>

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:04.957
<i>So are cottages.</i>

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:08.099
<i>Have you ever seen anything going on?</i>

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:33.492
You don't want it stuck up your ass,
by any chance?

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.694
If you mean what I think you mean...

01:10:37.466 --> 01:10:38.524
no.

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:40.829
No harm in asking.

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:48.606
Ken!

01:10:57.386 --> 01:10:58.683
We were just having a chat.

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:01.814
- The police! Out! Quick!
- Jesus.

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:36.686
Thank you.

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:48.231
My second play, <i>Loot</i>,
is a bigger hit than my first.

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:52.940
It's also a better play,
and it is the critics' choice.

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:54.767
Best play of the year.

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:58.212
The film rights have been sold
for a record figure.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.976
Currently I am working on a screenplay
for four boys...

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.415
who are nudging Jesus Christ...

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:05.351
for position of number one
most famous person ever.

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:08.515
But have I ever met these fabled creatures?

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:11.115
Have I ever met their manager,
Ms. Brian Epstein...

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:13.024
and have I been paid?

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:16.086
No. Then why am I doing it?

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:17.926
Vanity.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.365
I'm going to jack it in, Beatles or no Beatles.

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:25.197
What I would like to do at this moment...

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:28.471
would be to ease down
their Liverpudlian underpants...

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:31.513
and ram my Remington up their arses.

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:34.706
The lovable mop-heads.

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:38.013
- What about me?
- What about you?

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:42.148
I can't remember
when you last touched my cock.

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.190
I can, actually.

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:48.725
It was about two years ago.

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:51.966
Only, I can't remember the actual date.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:53.460
Pity.

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:56.364
I could have put it in my diary.

01:12:57.206 --> 01:13:00.107
"The last time Joe touched my cock.

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:05.077
"Grouse shooting begins."

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:12.114
Maybe we should go away.

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:16.951
Somewhere where there is plenty of sex.
And I don't mean Southport.

01:13:17.993 --> 01:13:20.461
Somewhere even you might be happy.

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:23.959
Morocco, maybe.

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:27.367
What do you think?

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:32.673
I don't want to go away.

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:36.803
I just want to go to the awards.

01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:39.643
I could! Look, "Joe Orton and guest."

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:42.178
I'd behave. I wouldn't say a word, I promise.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:43.309
- No.
- Why?

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:45.979
- Because it's for me. I wrote it.
- I gave you the title.

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:49.114
Okay, so when they have awards for titles,
you can go to that.

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:06.365
Yes?

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:12.636
No, this is Mr. Orton's personal assistant.

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:17.542
No, he's tied up at the moment.

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:21.850
I see.

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:25.015
Yes.

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:30.228
Thank you.

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:35.626
Paul McCartney's calling to see you.

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:37.963
He's on his way now.

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:40.040
- Here?
- Yeah.

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:42.899
Shit.

01:14:47.416 --> 01:14:48.940
- Was that him?
- No, no.

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:52.316
Someone more cultured.
The chauffeur, I think.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:55.354
- Did you tell him the address?
- He knew the address.

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:57.688
I wish I'd known. This place is like a pigsty.

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:59.090
He won't mind. He's used to it.

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:01.322
He's an ordinary working-class boy.
They all are.

01:15:01.396 --> 01:15:04.160
He's the nicest, though.
I've always liked him.

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:07.031
The others are more instinctive.

01:15:08.704 --> 01:15:12.162
I won't sulk. Just introduce me.

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:15.039
Say who I am, then I'll make myself scarce.

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:22.308
This is what it must be like
when one is about to meet the Queen.

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:23.908
Except, when one meets the Queen...

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:27.615
one normally hasn't threatened
to ram one's typewriter up her ass.

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:43.034
Mr. Orton?

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:45.669
I'm his personal assistant.

01:15:53.181 --> 01:15:55.342
He's waiting for you in the car.

01:16:43.498 --> 01:16:44.590
Joe!

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:57.508
- That was Paul McCartney.
- Was it?

01:16:57.879 --> 01:17:00.439
Kenneth, you are going to have
some memories.

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:55.095
<i>So Ken didn't get to the awards ceremony,</i>
<i>and I did.</i>

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:58.797
<i>I give you the award</i>
<i>on behalf of the Metropolitan Police...</i>

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:03.001
<i>At moments of triumph,</i>
<i>men can do without their wives.</i>

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:04.409
<i>They cramp our style.</i>

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:07.471
<i>- But sharing is what wives want.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:10.210
<i>And Ken was a coach as well as a wife.</i>

01:18:10.285 --> 01:18:11.513
<i>Poor Ken.</i>

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:15.384
<i>Still, it was a popular win.</i>

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:19.393
<i>Joe was young, the play was naughty.</i>
<i>It all seemed very bold.</i>

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:22.027
<i>My plays are about getting away with it...</i>

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:24.292
<i>and the ones who get away with it</i>
<i>are the guilty.</i>

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.891
<i>It's the innocents who get it in the neck.</i>

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:30.202
<i>But that all seems pretty true to life to me.</i>

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:31.864
<i>Not a fantasy at all.</i>

01:18:32.474 --> 01:18:35.534
<i>I've got away with it so far...</i>

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:38.378
<i>and I'm going to go on.</i>

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:40.111
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.414
- Shall I drop you?
- Actually, the 24 is handier.

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:50.788
- Why, where are you going?
- Just going on somewhere.

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:53.920
- Congratulations again.
- Thank you.

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:53.073
What did you say?

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:57.139
- Did you say anything?
- Nothing.

01:21:57.779 --> 01:21:58.905
You know me.

01:21:59.881 --> 01:22:00.973
Thank you.

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:02.649
Various people...

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:05.345
kissed me.

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:10.551
You should pack.

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:16.528
- Do you read my diary?
- No.

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:18.057
Why?

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:21.594
Maybe you'd like me a bit less.

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:23.927
Should I take my typewriter?

01:22:24.005 --> 01:22:26.769
- No, this is a holiday.
- Oh, just in case.

01:23:52.594 --> 01:23:55.324
Which one do you want?
Abbott or Costello?

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:57.087
I don't mind.

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:59.330
Which one do you think likes me?

01:23:59.401 --> 01:23:59.968
I'm not sure liking comes into it.

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:01.697
I'm not sure liking comes into it.

01:24:08.576 --> 01:24:11.044
So your sister's husband works in Epsom?

01:24:11.279 --> 01:24:12.837
Epsom, yes.

01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:15.946
In a hotel?

01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:17.784
Yes. Waiter.

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:20.548
Epsom's in Surrey...

01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:22.846
near London.

01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:43.608
And to think there's another two
coming round at 7:00.

01:24:43.678 --> 01:24:45.839
My life's beginning to run to a timetable...

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:48.474
that no member of the royal family
would tolerate.

01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:51.076
- I'm improving.
- You are.

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:55.285
Having it sucked regularly
is turning you back into a human being.

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:59.116
Who is this? No one knows we're here.

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:02.186
I gave the Beatles' office the number.
Just in case.

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:05.494
It's Brian Epstein.

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:11.930
I was very impressed
with your screenplay, Joe.

01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:15.142
But some areas I'm not sure
I've understood correctly...

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.235
and perhaps you could
talk me through those?

01:25:17.312 --> 01:25:18.643
<i>Delighted.</i>

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:23.240
The Beatles are all pursuing
the same girl, right?

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:24.607
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:25:24.752 --> 01:25:26.413
Well, maybe.

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:29.415
Knowing the boys as I do,
I would say that was...

01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:30.856
well, iffy.

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:32.283
However...

01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:34.995
<i>it's on Page 53...</i>

01:25:35.363 --> 01:25:39.129
<i>Scene 86, when we definitely</i>
<i>seem to kiss reality goodbye.</i>

01:25:39.534 --> 01:25:42.059
<i>Cut to the boys in bed with Susan.</i>

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:45.937
One of them is smoking a joint.
He passes it around.

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:49.999
Two points there, Joe.
One, these boys do not take drugs.

01:25:50.678 --> 01:25:54.205
<i>They never have taken drugs</i>
<i>and they never will take drugs.</i>

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:55.943
It's only a joint.

01:25:57.018 --> 01:26:00.886
Second point.
If the boys are all in bed with Susan...

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:04.948
this means, as I understand it,
that they are all in bed with each other.

01:26:06.928 --> 01:26:08.327
No, no, no.

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:11.787
<i>Why?</i>

01:26:12.066 --> 01:26:15.297
Why? Because these are
normal, healthy boys.

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:17.801
I take it they all sleep together.

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:19.806
They do not.

01:26:19.874 --> 01:26:21.705
But they're all very pretty.

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:24.644
I imagined they just had a good time.

01:26:25.146 --> 01:26:28.673
Sang, smoked, fucked everything in sight,
including each other.

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:31.548
I thought that was what success meant.

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.613
<i>Mr. Orton, success means...</i>

01:26:35.156 --> 01:26:37.886
It means a respect for the public.

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:41.194
Besides, one of the boys is happily married.

01:26:41.896 --> 01:26:43.693
I'm sorry, Mr. Orton.

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:46.059
I hope you're having a pleasant vacation.

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:12.580
Why do you have to work?

01:28:13.888 --> 01:28:15.378
Enjoy yourself.

01:28:16.357 --> 01:28:18.018
I am enjoying myself.

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.824
- Listen to this.
- Not now. I don't want to.

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:23.289
Not here.

01:28:26.267 --> 01:28:29.168
We'll get enough of this
when we get back to London.

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:34.468
Stop it.

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:36.437
Piss off.

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:42.676
Stupid nutter!

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.852
When we get back, we're finished.
This is the end.

01:28:47.922 --> 01:28:50.049
Why don't you add,
"I'm going back to Mother"?

01:28:50.124 --> 01:28:53.787
That's the kind of line
that makes your plays ultimately worthless.

01:28:55.363 --> 01:28:57.331
He's waiting to be paid.

01:29:01.202 --> 01:29:03.261
Actually, he's rather sweet.

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:06.129
I think I'll retire.

01:29:06.574 --> 01:29:08.098
Lick my wounds...

01:29:08.976 --> 01:29:10.739
or have them licked for me.

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:32.097
You might at least open a window.
The place stinks.

01:29:43.644 --> 01:29:45.077
That's good.

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:48.442
Peggy sold the Beatles script
to someone else.

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:50.950
I get paid twice over, apparently.

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:53.821
<i>The Observer</i> would like to interview me.

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:54.845
<i>The Observer</i> would like to interview me.

01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:59.924
And <i>Vogue</i> wonders if I'd be interested
in modeling some clothes.

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:02.486
So much for the holiday.

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:04.360
- What?
- I take you away for four weeks...

01:30:04.432 --> 01:30:06.957
you come back,
still the same jealous bitch as before.

01:30:07.034 --> 01:30:10.333
Have you got them out?
Yes, you have. I know you, come on.

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:12.931
Come on, do your act.

01:30:13.007 --> 01:30:14.736
- No!
- Come on, do your act.

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:18.007
How many is it, the fatal dose?

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.603
Twelve, is it?

01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:23.678
One, two...

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:26.185
Here you are. Fetch.

01:30:26.454 --> 01:30:29.082
And another. Yeah, and another.

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:30.249
Here.

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:32.720
- Answer that.
- No.

01:30:32.794 --> 01:30:34.159
Answer it.

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:41.360
Hello?

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:43.927
Hello, Leonie.

01:30:45.339 --> 01:30:47.398
Yes, it was very nice. Thank you.

01:30:48.609 --> 01:30:49.837
Hold on.

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:58.413
Hello.

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.248
When was this?

01:31:07.228 --> 01:31:10.197
Does that mean
there will have to be a funeral?

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:14.660
Shit.

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:18.167
I'll come up. Okay.

01:31:19.207 --> 01:31:20.265
Bye.

01:31:24.178 --> 01:31:26.510
- My mother's dead.
- Oh, Joe.

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:32.915
I know what it's like.

01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:38.318
My whole life changed
when my mother died.

01:31:39.093 --> 01:31:40.560
I'm so sorry.

01:31:42.763 --> 01:31:43.991
I'm not.

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:53.505
And while I'm away, see a doctor.

01:31:54.509 --> 01:31:57.205
A proper doctor. You're sick.

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:16.120
Hello, duck.

01:32:35.082 --> 01:32:36.447
Your mother's ready now...

01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:39.418
if you'd like to come in
and pay your respects.

01:32:58.973 --> 01:33:01.737
I think father first.

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:11.217
Stop it, Joe. I don't want to laugh.

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:13.150
I didn't know her. I don't want to laugh.

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:16.417
I still don't know
why you want to go calling yourself Joe.

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:18.321
John's a much classier name.

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:33.065
You've left her glasses off.

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:37.142
Yes. You'll find that's normal procedure.

01:33:37.912 --> 01:33:40.813
Generally speaking, people prefer it.

01:33:44.251 --> 01:33:46.481
What's happened to her teeth?

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:49.720
Mislaid, apparently.

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:52.719
Shame.

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:55.687
She was proud of her teeth.

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:32.299
Oh, God. Chuck them away.

01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:35.199
I want something to remember her by.

01:34:35.269 --> 01:34:37.669
You've no feeling at all, do you?

01:34:45.246 --> 01:34:47.510
I've started night school now.

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:51.108
Modern English Literature.

01:34:53.821 --> 01:34:56.551
It's amazing how many writers are queer.

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:02.055
Do you think Mom's why you like lads?

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:04.754
Lay off.

01:35:08.335 --> 01:35:09.136
You do look at lads. I've seen you.

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:11.001
You do look at lads. I've seen you.

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:17.970
I've had a better time than they had.

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:21.009
Sexually.

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:24.984
We had no time at all.

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:32.084
There must have been times...

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.823
when you were happy.

01:35:35.029 --> 01:35:36.087
Yes.

01:35:38.365 --> 01:35:39.593
Several.

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:49.671
You kiss now. You never used to kiss.

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:51.869
That's London.

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:00.978
I never told you...

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:03.319
I met Paul McCartney.

01:36:53.741 --> 01:36:55.902
Thought you were a bobby at first.

01:36:56.076 --> 01:36:58.203
- Black tie.
- A funeral.

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:02.005
- Who died?
- My mother and two sisters.

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:04.846
Dead in the fire that consumed our home.

01:37:05.219 --> 01:37:07.551
- You must be heartbroken.
- I am.

01:37:08.522 --> 01:37:10.217
Handle my balls.

01:37:19.366 --> 01:37:22.062
Do you need any assistance
in stripping the corpse?

01:37:22.136 --> 01:37:25.731
I do not need a lesson in anatomy.
I was a trained nurse.

01:37:26.707 --> 01:37:29.198
I am now removing her underclothes.

01:37:29.276 --> 01:37:31.676
Please. You forget, this was my mother.

01:37:31.745 --> 01:37:33.872
- I'm sorry.
- What about?

01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:35.714
Your mother.

01:37:35.883 --> 01:37:37.544
Hand me the prop teeth.

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.176
Don't mess about. I'm on.

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:43.087
Use these instead. They were my mother's.

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:45.586
Jesus Christ!

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.387
Is there anything else?

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:51.530
Is there anything else?

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:53.697
Her teeth.

01:37:56.437 --> 01:37:59.099
<i>I don't know what to say about the end.</i>

01:37:59.273 --> 01:38:01.207
<i>It wasn't a natural act.</i>

01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:02.902
<i>Well, obviously.</i>

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:06.677
<i>I didn't mean that.</i>
<i>These things happen, that's all.</i>

01:38:06.747 --> 01:38:10.080
I have an appointment with the psychiatrist
at 10:00 tomorrow.

01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:11.208
Yes.

01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:14.310
Thank you for all the trouble you've taken.

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:17.284
You don't want a psychiatrist.

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:20.193
It's this room. You've lived here too long.

01:38:20.261 --> 01:38:21.353
So?

01:38:21.428 --> 01:38:24.158
I keep finding places.
You won't even go look.

01:38:24.231 --> 01:38:27.667
"Two bedrooms, two reception rooms,
bathroom, and patio.

01:38:27.735 --> 01:38:30.829
"This well-proportioned accommodation
can be easily maintained...

01:38:30.905 --> 01:38:33.772
"with minimum effort,
leaving more time for leisure pursuits."

01:38:33.841 --> 01:38:35.069
- Where?
- East Croydon.

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:36.403
I won't live in East Croydon.

01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:39.503
You're so unadventurous. I love the country.

01:38:39.613 --> 01:38:41.706
It'll be nice
to see the occasional green field.

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:43.909
- East Croydon?
- Anywhere! Not you.

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:47.317
You'd be having a troll up and down
till your balls dropped off.

01:38:47.388 --> 01:38:49.322
What did the doctor say?

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:55.785
He's already talking about hospital.

01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:59.224
I haven't even seen the psychiatrist.

01:39:01.902 --> 01:39:04.063
Still, he's a very good doctor.

01:39:07.474 --> 01:39:09.635
He treats cabinet ministers.

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.255
What happens if we split up?

01:39:28.462 --> 01:39:31.192
How would that help me?
We're talking about me.

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:32.863
We can't go on like this.

01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:34.628
I've given you everything. I made you.

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:36.932
Listen to the dialogue, dear.

01:39:37.237 --> 01:39:39.705
I'm not Eliza fucking Doolittle.
I made myself.

01:39:39.773 --> 01:39:41.764
- Those are my books.
- I'd see you all right.

01:39:41.842 --> 01:39:44.333
- I taught you.
- I taught you, too.

01:39:44.411 --> 01:39:47.141
What? How to go into a public lavatory?

01:39:48.415 --> 01:39:49.746
Anyway...

01:39:50.117 --> 01:39:53.177
if it hadn't been you,
it would have been someone else.

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:55.983
- Sleep on it.
- How?

01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:58.858
I could give you a wank.

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:01.827
- What do you want?
- Joe.

01:40:03.497 --> 01:40:04.555
John.

01:40:04.631 --> 01:40:05.689
I'm not John.

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:07.565
John's dead.

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:13.765
If you change your mind about the wank,
don't wake me up.

01:40:27.721 --> 01:40:29.848
I don't understand my life.

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:33.923
I was an only child.

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:37.262
I lost both my parents.

01:40:38.799 --> 01:40:41.495
By the time I was 20, I was going bald.

01:40:42.936 --> 01:40:44.597
I'm a homosexual.

01:40:47.241 --> 01:40:49.732
In the way of circumstances
and background...

01:40:49.810 --> 01:40:52.643
I had everything
an artist could possibly want.

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:56.779
It was practically a blueprint.

01:40:58.585 --> 01:41:01.782
I was programmed to be a novelist
or a playwright.

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:06.192
But I'm not and you are.

01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:08.686
Joe?

01:41:11.665 --> 01:41:14.099
You do everything better than me!

01:41:15.035 --> 01:41:17.299
You even sleep better than me!

01:41:46.834 --> 01:41:48.802
I should have used this.

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:51.362
More theatrical.

01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:55.401
But you'd have spotted that straight away.

01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:29.207
I loved him.

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:32.577
I must have loved him.

01:42:34.047 --> 01:42:36.015
I chose him to kill me.

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:36.033
I was scheduled to pick him up at 12:00.

01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:37.633
A private lunch.

01:43:38.812 --> 01:43:41.542
He leads an increasingly glamorous life.

01:43:47.454 --> 01:43:49.251
Is he a heavy sleeper?

01:43:49.323 --> 01:43:52.019
I know nothing about his personal life.

01:43:52.626 --> 01:43:55.686
Idle curiosity has never been
my strong point.

01:43:56.997 --> 01:43:59.363
Try looking through the letterbox.

01:44:03.503 --> 01:44:04.902
Hello, Mr. Orton.

01:44:05.572 --> 01:44:10.009
Personally, I've driven in the firm's car,
but different destinations.

01:44:12.012 --> 01:44:14.173
Has the other got a bald head?

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:17.249
No, he wears a wig.

01:44:21.588 --> 01:44:23.681
Can you break down this door?

01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:25.321
Clifford!

01:44:25.659 --> 01:44:27.752
Can we break down the door?

01:44:27.828 --> 01:44:29.318
Certainly not.

01:44:29.429 --> 01:44:32.489
If there's damage to be done, call the police.

01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:34.298
That's their job.

01:44:44.378 --> 01:44:48.144
If he hadn't murdered Joe,
nobody would ever have known his name.

01:44:48.215 --> 01:44:50.046
Ken was the first wife.

01:44:50.717 --> 01:44:52.878
Did all the work and the waiting, and then...

01:44:56.823 --> 01:44:59.883
First wives don't usually
beat their husbands' heads in.

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:02.121
No, though why, I can't think.

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:05.597
So what does that make you?
The second wife?

01:45:06.099 --> 01:45:07.999
Better than that, dear.

01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:10.095
The widow.

01:45:21.381 --> 01:45:23.178
<i>There were two ceremonies.</i>

01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:26.686
<i>Joe's at Golders Green.</i>
<i>Everybody there. House full.</i>

01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:30.413
<i>Ken's at Enfield.</i>
<i>You couldn't give tickets away.</i>

01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:31.582
<i>Three people.</i>

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:32.989
<i>That's sad.</i>

01:45:34.361 --> 01:45:35.453
<i>Well...</i>

01:45:36.863 --> 01:45:39.388
<i>they fetched up together at the end.</i>

01:45:41.401 --> 01:45:43.835
Strictly speaking,
we would have preferred it...

01:45:43.904 --> 01:45:47.169
if both the deceased
had been cremated on the premises.

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:51.108
Intermingling would then have been
carried out by experienced personnel...

01:45:51.178 --> 01:45:53.339
under controlled conditions.

01:46:05.826 --> 01:46:09.387
I think I'm putting in more of Joe
than I am of Kenneth.

01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:14.390
It's a gesture, dear, not a recipe.

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:25.472
I hope nobody gets to hear about this
in Leicester.
