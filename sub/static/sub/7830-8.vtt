I think a hurricane is coming!

01:07.233 --> 01:08.860
Oh, Lisa.

01:08.943 --> 01:11.571
There's no record of a hurricane
ever hitting Springfield.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.449
Yes, but the records
only go back to 1978

was mysteriously blown away.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.132

02:54.215 --> 02:56.092
I was born
in this nursing home,

02:56.176 --> 02:58.720

of you changing your mind?

03:00.638 --> 03:01.806
Sure. Let's go.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.568
Well,

03:13.651 --> 03:14.944
You know, maybe you folks
should come over

03:15.028 --> 03:16.321

03:16.404 --> 03:18.198
Oh, it'll be fun.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.575

anything extra.

No, siree. We'd be happy

to be thankful for.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.448
Now, that kind
of attitude's

06:47.532 --> 06:49.117
not going to get
your house back.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.411
I'm sure your insurance
will cover the house.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.287
Uh, well, no.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.415
Neddy doesn't
believe in insurance.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.208
He considers it
a form of gambling.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.584
You know,
it's kind of funny.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.044
The only thing
that survived the storm

07:00.128 --> 07:02.004
were the family
tombstones.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.798
They're all
we have left.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.008
Well, call us
if you need anything.

07:11.556 --> 07:14.016
We got new clothes
from the donation bin!

07:14.100 --> 07:15.643

08:11.407 --> 08:13.409
I kind of feel like Job.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.203
Well...

08:15.286 --> 08:18.498
Aren't you being
a tad melodramatic, Ned?

08:18.581 --> 08:21.459
Also, I believe Job
was right-handed.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.793
But, Reverend,
I need to know.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.254
Is God punishing me?

08:25.338 --> 08:28.424
Ooh... Short answer:
"Yes" with an "If."

08:28.508 --> 08:31.385
Long answer:
"No" with a "But."

08:31.469 --> 08:33.804
Uh, if you need additional
solace, by the way,

08:33.888 --> 08:35.389
I've got a copy
of something or other

08:35.473 --> 08:36.766

08:49.487 --> 08:50.821

08:55.660 --> 08:57.703

09:00.289 --> 09:01.582
Why me, Lord?

09:01.666 --> 09:03.084
Where have I gone wrong?

09:03.167 --> 09:04.919
I've always been nice to people.

09:05.002 --> 09:06.629
I don't drink or dance or swear.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.048
I've even kept kosher
just to be on the safe side.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.467
I've done everything
the Bible says--

09:11.551 --> 09:13.678
Even the stuff that contradicts
the other stuff.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.388
What more could I do?

09:15.471 --> 09:18.558
I--I feel like
I'm coming apart here.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.434
I want to yell out,
but I--I just can't

09:20.518 --> 09:23.604
dang-diddily-do-dang-do-don-

09:33.447 --> 09:35.491
Something incredible
has happened!

09:35.575 --> 09:36.617
Oh, what happened now?

09:36.701 --> 09:37.827
Did the rubble burn down?

09:37.910 --> 09:39.579
No! Come on!

Oh, they rebuilt
our house.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.133
Oh! It's a miracle.

09:52.216 --> 09:55.469
I started making some calls last night,
and before I knew it,

09:55.553 --> 09:57.805
practically all of Springfield
was offering to help.

09:57.888 --> 10:01.058
-Mm-hmm. My pleasure.
-Happy to help.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.935
-Fabulous experience.
-Sure!

10:03.019 --> 10:04.437
Hope you like it,
neighbor.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.688
We didn't have the best tools

10:05.771 --> 10:07.440
or all the know-how,

10:07.523 --> 10:10.484
but we did have
a wheelbarrow full of love.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.486
And a cement mixer
full of hope

10:12.570 --> 10:13.613
and some cement.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.448
Oh, it's wonderful.

10:15.531 --> 10:19.035
I--I--I... I don't know
how I can possibly repay you

10:19.118 --> 10:20.578
but if any of you
ever need a favor

10:20.661 --> 10:24.582
just look for the happiest man
in Springfield.

10:24.665 --> 10:26.334
No, no, not me, friends.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.045

but thanks for looking.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.345

10:37.428 --> 10:39.513
The living room
and dining rooms

10:41.932 --> 10:43.059
-Uh-huh.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.311
And-- Oh!
Looks like a loose nail.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.438
Eh, one out of 25
ain't bad.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.108
Your beautiful

10:51.192 --> 10:52.985
Just as you
remember it.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.905
Was that, uh...

10:55.988 --> 10:58.115
Was that toilet always
next to the refrigerator?

10:58.199 --> 10:59.659
Uh, Ned,

10:59.742 --> 11:02.078
you ever try lugging a toilet
up a flight of stairs?

11:02.161 --> 11:04.080
Lisa and I built
your room.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.040
But I don't like this clown.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.500
Uh, I wouldn't
take it down

11:07.583 --> 11:08.626
if I were you.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.710
It's a load-bearing
poster.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.003
(ceiling cracking)

11:13.798 --> 11:16.592
(electricity buzzing)

11:16.676 --> 11:18.886
Now, this is a room
with electricity

11:18.969 --> 11:21.180
but it has
too much electricity.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.348
So I don't know.

11:22.431 --> 11:23.516
You might want
to wear a hat.

11:23.599 --> 11:24.892
Uh-huh.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.687
The floor feels
a little gritty here.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.522
Yeah. We ran out
of floorboards there

11:29.605 --> 11:30.856
so we painted the dirt.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.525
Pretty clever!

11:34.610 --> 11:37.446
Oh! Something is definitely
wrong with this hallway!

11:38.739 --> 11:39.699
Come on in!

11:39.782 --> 11:42.493
It's your master bedroom!

11:42.576 --> 11:43.619
Ow! My nose!

11:43.703 --> 11:45.746
Well, I've seen about enough.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.581
So, Flanders,

11:47.665 --> 11:50.543
what do you think
of the house that love built?

11:54.672 --> 11:56.257
Aw, shoot!

11:56.340 --> 11:58.509
(sighs)

12:00.803 --> 12:02.555
(huffing)

12:02.638 --> 12:03.556
(lens cracks)

12:03.639 --> 12:05.433
Aww...

12:05.516 --> 12:08.769
Now calm down, Neddily-diddily-
diddily-diddily-diddily.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.731
They did their best,
shoddily-iddily-iddily-diddily.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.608
Got to be nice--
Hostility-ilitity-bility-dility.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.944
Aw, hell,
diddily-ding-dong crap!

12:17.027 --> 12:19.447
Can't your morons
do anything right?!

12:19.530 --> 12:22.158
-(crowd gasping)
-Hey!

12:22.241 --> 12:24.660
Ned, we meant well,

12:24.744 --> 12:26.370
and everyone here
tried their best.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.788
Well, my family and I

12:27.872 --> 12:30.249
can't live in good
intentions, Marge!

12:30.332 --> 12:32.168
Oh, your family
is out of control

12:32.251 --> 12:33.586
but we can't blame you

12:33.669 --> 12:36.756
because you have
good intentions.

12:36.839 --> 12:37.798
Hey, back off, man!

12:37.882 --> 12:40.634
Oh, okay, dude.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.970
I wouldn't want you
to have a cow, man.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.346
Here's a catchphrase

12:44.430 --> 12:45.890
you better learn
for your adult years.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.516
Hey, buddy,
got a quarter?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.769
(all gasping and murmuring)

12:49.852 --> 12:51.270
I am shocked and appalled.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.439
Mr. Flanders,
with all due respect

12:53.522 --> 12:55.065
Bart didn't do anything.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.109
(gasps) Do I hear the sound
of butting in?

12:57.193 --> 12:59.069
It's got to be
little Lisa Simpson,

12:59.153 --> 13:01.697
Springfield's answer
to a question no one asked!

13:01.781 --> 13:03.783
-(goofy laughing)
-What do we have here?

13:03.866 --> 13:05.785
The long, flabby arm
of the law?

13:05.868 --> 13:07.661
The last case
you got to the bottom of

13:07.745 --> 13:09.789
was a case of Mallomars!

13:09.872 --> 13:12.374
Mallomars.
Oh, that's going in the act.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.835
Oh, yeah, the clown,

13:14.919 --> 13:16.045
the only one
of you buffoons

13:16.128 --> 13:17.588
who doesn't
make me laugh.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.048
And as for you,
I don't know you,

13:19.131 --> 13:20.674
but I'm sure
you're a jerk!

13:20.758 --> 13:22.051
Hey, I've only been here
a few minutes.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.093
What's going on?

13:23.177 --> 13:25.679
You ugly,
hate-filled man.

13:25.763 --> 13:30.226
Hey, hey, I may be ugly
and hate-filled, but I, um...

13:30.309 --> 13:31.727
What was the third thing
you said?

13:33.103 --> 13:35.481
Homer...

13:35.564 --> 13:37.525
you are the worst human being

13:37.608 --> 13:40.611
I have ever met.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.196
Hey, I got off pretty easy.

13:42.279 --> 13:43.989
(crowd murmuring)

13:44.073 --> 13:46.367
Neddy? Uh, wait.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.827
Where you going?

13:47.910 --> 13:49.578
(tires squealing)

13:49.662 --> 13:57.044
<i>♪ Aloha oe... ♪</i>

13:57.127 --> 14:03.217
♪ Doo-doo-doo-doo ♪

14:03.300 --> 14:08.681

14:08.764 --> 14:14.687

14:18.357 --> 14:20.734
I just attacked all my friends
and neighbors

14:20.818 --> 14:22.319
just for trying to help me.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.988
I'd like
to commit myself.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.030
Very well.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.407
Shall I show you to your room,

14:26.490 --> 14:27.616
or would you prefer
to be dragged off

14:27.700 --> 14:29.118
kicking and screaming?

14:29.201 --> 14:31.203
Ooh, kicking and screaming,
please.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.914
As you wish.

14:33.998 --> 14:40.004
(screaming)

14:45.217 --> 14:46.468
Flanders?

14:46.552 --> 14:47.636
Ned Flanders?

14:50.848 --> 14:52.141
I'd better call Dr. Foster.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.143
(ringing)

14:54.226 --> 14:56.395
Yes, Dr. Foster here.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.730
Ned Flanders?

14:57.813 --> 14:59.440
You're sure?

14:59.523 --> 15:01.567
No, no, no,
I'll come right over.

15:01.650 --> 15:05.404
And may God have mercy
on us all.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.197
Darling, there's an emergency
at the hospital.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.365
Where are my shoes?

15:08.449 --> 15:10.367
Oh, I think
they're in the den.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.869
In the den?

15:11.952 --> 15:14.538
May God have mercy
on us all.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.251
Well, how are you feeling
this evening?

15:19.335 --> 15:20.586
Uh...

15:20.669 --> 15:21.962
actually,
I'm a little chilly.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.047
Can I have another straitjacket?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.465
Of course.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.051
Thank you.

15:27.134 --> 15:28.552
Dr. Foster!

15:28.636 --> 15:32.932
Hmm... Well, at least
your memory is not crazy.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.433
Now, Ned,
you may remember

15:34.516 --> 15:37.186
we spent some time
together 30 years ago.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.605
Do you recall what you
were like back then?

15:39.688 --> 15:42.816
-Oh, sure. I was a good little boy.
-Were you?

15:50.449 --> 15:51.784
<i>Whee! I'm Dick Tracy!</i>

15:51.867 --> 15:54.078
<i>Bam! Take that, Prune-Face!</i>

15:54.161 --> 15:55.454
<i>Now I'm Prune-Face.</i>

15:55.537 --> 15:56.580
<i>Take that, Dick Tracy!</i>

15:56.664 --> 15:58.165
<i>Now I'm Prune Tracy.</i>

15:58.248 --> 15:59.208
<i>Take that, Dick...</i>

15:59.291 --> 16:00.584
<i>Ned, stop it at once!</i>

16:00.668 --> 16:03.629
<i>-Stop it!</i>
-(film flapping)

16:03.712 --> 16:06.298
I can't believe
I was such a terror.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.008
Well, neither
could your parents.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.843
That's why they brought you
to me.

16:12.054 --> 16:15.140
Well, I'm afraid young Ned
is unusually aggressive

16:15.224 --> 16:17.518
but I can't seem
to find a cause for it.

16:17.601 --> 16:18.686
Hey, hey!

16:18.769 --> 16:20.604
Get down
from that bookshelf, please.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.481
Most of those books
haven't been discredited yet.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.441
Would you please
tell your son to stop?

16:24.525 --> 16:26.193
We can't do it, man.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.486
That's discipline.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.238
That's like
telling Gene Krupa

16:29.321 --> 16:31.824
not to go boom, boom,
bap-bap-bap, boom, boom!

16:31.907 --> 16:33.993
(imitating drumming)

16:34.076 --> 16:35.494
Boom! Boom! Tiss!

16:35.577 --> 16:37.496
Hmm... Lack of discipline.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.123
I'm beginning
to see the problem.

16:39.206 --> 16:40.833
We don't believe in rules.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.918
Like, we gave them up

16:43.002 --> 16:45.879
when we starting living
like freaky beatniks.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.966
You don't believe in rules,
yet you want to control Ned's anger.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.218
Yeah. You've got
to help us, doc.

16:51.301 --> 16:54.304
We've tried nothing,
and we're all out of ideas.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.724
Hmm... There is
an experimental therapy

16:56.807 --> 16:59.685
that might help Ned
contain his anger.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.854
It was known as
the "University of Minnesota

17:01.937 --> 17:03.981
Spankalogical Protocol."

17:11.405 --> 17:14.450
And that's just
about eight months...

17:14.533 --> 17:16.035
Hmm... Now.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.580
Well, Ned,
how do you feel?

17:19.663 --> 17:21.665
I feel...

17:21.749 --> 17:22.916
Fine.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.668
You don't feel...

17:24.752 --> 17:25.669
Angry?

17:25.753 --> 17:28.380
Abso-tively not-arino.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.299
How do you feel about me?

17:30.382 --> 17:32.551
Pretty darn
diddily-doodly...

17:32.634 --> 17:35.345
good.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.889
The only problem
with the treatment

17:36.972 --> 17:38.599
was that it worked too well.

17:38.682 --> 17:41.685
You became unable
to express any anger at all.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.480
From that point on,
any time you felt angry

17:44.563 --> 17:46.065
you could only respond

17:46.148 --> 17:48.484
with a string
of nonsensical jabbering.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.402
Well, I'll be
darn-diddily-arned.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.653
Yeah, that's the stuff.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.697
You suppressed your rage
for so long

17:53.781 --> 17:58.077
it finally erupted as
a massive public explosion.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.745
It sure did-diddily-id.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.997
All right, all right,
just watch it there.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.582
I'm here to help,
you know.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.709
Now, I'd like
to try something.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.169
Is there any person

18:07.252 --> 18:10.422
who makes you
particularly angry?

18:10.506 --> 18:11.632
(phone rings)

18:11.715 --> 18:12.758
Yello?

18:12.841 --> 18:14.551
Yes?

18:14.635 --> 18:17.346
Mental hospital?!

18:17.429 --> 18:18.764
I don't know
any Ned Flanders.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.057
The man who lived
next door

18:20.140 --> 18:21.600
until his house
blew down.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.102
Oh, him.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.732
Mr. Simpson?
Dr. Foster.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.983
Please come with me.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.819
You folks are free
to roam the grounds.

18:31.902 --> 18:32.945
Just remember:

18:33.028 --> 18:35.114
One of our patients
is a cannibal.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.740
Try to guess which one.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.867
I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.789
MAN: Everyone outside
of this room is against me!

18:43.872 --> 18:44.790
I can hear you walking by--

18:44.873 --> 18:47.626
It stinks! It stinks!

18:47.709 --> 18:48.961
It stinks!

18:49.044 --> 18:51.839
Yes, Mr. Sherman,
everything stinks.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.676
We want to teach Ned

18:55.759 --> 18:57.970
to release his anger
in healthy doses.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.472
We need someone
so irritating

19:00.556 --> 19:04.476
that Ned simply will not be able
to repress his rage.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.521
Homer,
can you be that annoying?

19:07.604 --> 19:09.898
(grunts)
What?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.150
Get in the booth.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.827
"Ned Flanders,
I mock your value system.

19:21.910 --> 19:25.497
You also appear foolish
in the eyes of others."

19:25.581 --> 19:27.291
(chuckles)
Well, howdy, Homer.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.376
Ooh, thanks
for dropping by.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.295
Mm, he's not
responding.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.547
Proceed to level two
antagonism.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.552
"Past instances in which
I professed to like you

19:38.635 --> 19:40.053
were fraudulent."

19:40.137 --> 19:42.681
Oh, well, I'll just
have to try harder.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.433
(chuckles)
Ooh! Thanks for dropping by.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.476
Ah, he's still repressing.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.187
Maximum hostility factor.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.607
"I engaged in intercourse

19:51.690 --> 19:53.859
with your spouse
or significant other."

19:53.942 --> 19:56.111
Now, that's psychiatry.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.529
Huh? Huh?

19:57.613 --> 19:58.864
(forced laugh)

19:58.947 --> 20:01.158
Very funny, wise guy.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.659
<i>Aw, that's it.</i>

20:02.743 --> 20:03.702
<i>You just can't</i>
<i>insult this guy.</i>

20:03.785 --> 20:05.329
<i>You call him a moron</i>

20:05.412 --> 20:06.455
<i>and he just sits there</i>
<i>grinning moron-ally.</i>

20:06.538 --> 20:07.873
<i>Hi, neighbor.</i>

20:07.956 --> 20:09.499
You know what your problem is,
Flanders?

20:09.583 --> 20:11.210
You're afraid
to be human.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.670
(chuckles) No.
Now, why would I be afraid of that?

20:13.754 --> 20:15.714
Because humans are
obnoxious sometimes.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.299
Humans hate things.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.218
Well, maybe a few
of them do...

20:19.301 --> 20:20.719
Back east.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.679
I can't find what
Homer's saying.

20:22.763 --> 20:23.680
Did you write that?

20:23.764 --> 20:25.724
Um... Did you like it?

20:25.807 --> 20:27.267
Come on, Flanders.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.477
There's got to be
something you hate.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.895
What about mosquito bites?

20:29.978 --> 20:32.648
Mmm-mmm.
Sure are fun to scratch.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.191
Mmm, satisfying.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.735
What about, uh...

20:36.818 --> 20:38.403
fluorescent lights?

20:38.487 --> 20:40.572
Oh, they hum like angels.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.283
You're never lonely if you've
got a fluorescent light.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.285
See?
You like everything.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.204
No, that's not true.

20:47.287 --> 20:50.082
I--I--I... I don't like
the service at the post office.

20:50.165 --> 20:54.461
You know, it's all rush, rush,
get you in, get you out.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.088
Then they've got those
machines in the lobby--

20:56.171 --> 20:57.756
They're even faster.
No help there.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.174
You might even say...

20:59.258 --> 21:01.927
I hate the post office.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.971
That and my parents.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.222
Lousy beatniks.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.976
Hey, that felt good.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.978
He just said
he hates his parents.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.688
Do you know
what that means?

21:12.771 --> 21:14.481
Uh, what do you think?

21:14.564 --> 21:15.857
It means he's cured.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.192
That's what I said.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.196
(cheering)

21:23.991 --> 21:24.908
Thanks, everyone.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.576
I'm all better now.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.663
No more storing up the anger
till I explode.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.748
If any of you does something
I don't like,

21:31.832 --> 21:33.583
you are going to hear
about it.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.837
(cheering and applauding
and whistling)

21:36.920 --> 21:39.715
Yes, that's
very healthy, Ned.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.425
And if you really tick me off,

21:41.508 --> 21:43.343
I'm going to run you down
with my car.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.971
-Ha!
-Yeah... Um...

21:46.054 --> 21:48.015
(scattered applause)

21:48.098 --> 21:49.725
(chuckles)

21:49.808 --> 21:52.144
Ned, you so crazy.
