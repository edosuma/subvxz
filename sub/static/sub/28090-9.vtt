WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:04.439
How about some mutual respect?

00:04.482 --> 00:06.876
As of today, we are all
officially working together.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.007
As a team.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.531
Led by me. Led by me.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.141
I mean, your team needs you.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.316
Do you think they need me?

00:12.360 --> 00:14.057
You were Will's best friend,

00:14.101 --> 00:15.580
and you slept with his fiancÃ©e.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.060
God!

00:17.104 --> 00:19.497
What's up? No, never touch my stuff.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.934
My teacher wrote
in my report card,

00:21.978 --> 00:24.502
"Doesn't play well with others."

00:24.546 --> 00:26.069
All right, I'm in position.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.071
It's showtime, people.
Follow my lead.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.246
Or followour lead,

00:29.290 --> 00:31.074
'cause, again, co-captains.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.225
Jai, stun gas primed and ready?

00:51.268 --> 00:52.443
Yep.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.228
You don't have to say
"primed" and "ready."

00:54.271 --> 00:55.620
They mean the same thing.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.796
Message received and heard.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.756
Come on. Not even a chuckle?

01:00.799 --> 01:03.063
That was comedy gold
right there.

01:03.106 --> 01:05.194
Standish, how long do you need
to knock out security?

01:05.239 --> 01:08.198
Already done. I'm that good.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.602
Hey, who picked out
these uniforms?

01:09.634 --> 01:11.636
What are we, space janitors?

01:11.680 --> 01:13.136
Only thing that could make these
better... if it was a onesie.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.771
Frankie, Susan, you in position?

01:15.814 --> 01:17.947
Yeah. No sign of the target.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.209
His car's still here, though.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.907
Come on. I'm starving.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.213
Can we just go get a pizza?

01:23.257 --> 01:25.215
Hey, guys, McElroy's
the biggest heroin importer

01:25.259 --> 01:26.347
in Southeast Asia.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.218
Let's try to focus
on what's important.

01:28.262 --> 01:29.480
I want pepperoni.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.395
So we're gonna do pizza
in Hong Kong?

01:31.439 --> 01:32.962
It's better than you think.

01:33.005 --> 01:34.766
No, it can't be better than
that place that we went to

01:34.790 --> 01:36.400
in the Village on Friday. I know!

01:36.444 --> 01:38.248
I asked the two of you
out to dinner on Friday,

01:38.272 --> 01:39.795
and you both said you were busy.

01:40.883 --> 01:42.189
That's not cool.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.236
Hey.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.716
You're confident that stun gas

01:47.759 --> 01:49.433
can neutralize McElroy
andall his bodyguards?

01:49.457 --> 01:50.806
If by "stun gas," you mean

01:50.849 --> 01:53.939
my own special blend
of methoxyflurane, then, sure.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.985
That's cool... metha-fl-snore.

01:56.028 --> 01:57.117
That's great.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.268
How did you
come up with that stuff?

01:58.292 --> 01:59.989
Why are you asking
all these questions?

02:00.032 --> 02:01.164
It's not a big deal.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.533
I just... You know,
we work together.

02:02.557 --> 02:04.012
We really haven't got
a chance to know each other.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.318
I mean, I don't know
where you grew up.

02:05.342 --> 02:07.127
I don't know
what your parents are like.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.495
I don't know what kind
of ice cream you like.

02:08.519 --> 02:12.306
I like pralines and cream,
but it's... specific to me.

02:12.349 --> 02:13.350
Okay.

02:13.394 --> 02:14.830
So, I grew up

02:14.873 --> 02:16.484
in this really small town
in India

02:16.527 --> 02:18.181
called none of
your damn business.

02:19.182 --> 02:20.638
All right, well,
you can try to fight this,

02:20.662 --> 02:21.793
but it's gonna happen.

02:21.837 --> 02:22.881
Nope. It's not.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.189
Kidding.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.625
Hey, Frankie, where'd you go?

02:27.669 --> 02:29.323
I'm... exploring.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.467
Will.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.295
Will. Hey, look. Up here.

02:45.339 --> 02:46.818
No, over here.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.603
I've got eyes on McElroy.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.363
He's not looking too good, but
he's only got two men with him.

02:50.387 --> 02:51.823
I'm sure I could take him now.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.584
No, don't engage.
Let them proceed to the exits

02:53.608 --> 02:55.305
and have the gas
take them out, as planned.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.177
I hear you.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.396
I'm starting to really
like my idea, though.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.093
Great, and I hear you,

03:01.137 --> 03:03.705
but plans usually work best
when you stick to them.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.838
Frankie, don't put that down.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.884
Don't... Don't...

03:08.927 --> 03:10.407
Frankie, don't...

03:10.451 --> 03:11.626
You listen to me.

03:11.669 --> 03:12.690
You get back here right now.

03:12.714 --> 03:13.976
Don't you...

03:14.019 --> 03:15.369
Where are you going?
Hey, stop it!

03:15.412 --> 03:17.371
Frankie, do not use that Taser!

03:22.376 --> 03:24.204
Target on the move, stairwell 3.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.770
Where's the rest
of the security team?!

03:25.814 --> 03:27.139
Susan, he's probably
coming to you.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.382
Jai, go help her grab him.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.254
Copy that.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.864
Standish, get the car.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.233
Why do Ihave to get the car?
I can help with McElroy.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.257
Aw, come on...

03:36.999 --> 03:38.261
I'm-a go get the car.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.305
Get down!

03:42.396 --> 03:43.962
Frankie, you need assistance?

03:44.006 --> 03:46.269
I found the rest
of his security team.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.427
There might be too many
to shoot our way out,

03:54.451 --> 03:55.583
but I say we go for it.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.266
Yeah, no, no,
let them get closer, though.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.371
Freeze!

04:01.415 --> 04:02.720
Freeze. In the air.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.244
Get down on your knees. Come on.

04:06.202 --> 04:07.421
Now?

04:07.464 --> 04:08.726
Just a little closer.

04:13.601 --> 04:14.732
Jai...

04:14.776 --> 04:16.298
take us all out.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.170
If that's what you want.

04:18.214 --> 04:19.302
Come on.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.783
Nighty night.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.577
I blame youfor this.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.393
You ready to train?

05:07.916 --> 05:09.787
Let's do this.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.446
All right. Okay.

05:16.490 --> 05:17.926
My turn.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.718
You tired?

05:27.762 --> 05:29.677
I'm good. You seem tired.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.201
You all right? You need a break?

05:33.507 --> 05:34.551
I'm good.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.646
I think I'm bleeding internally.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.651
Hey, man.

05:47.695 --> 05:50.654
I, I had
some crazy dreams last night.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.743
Does that...
That stun gas of yours...

05:52.787 --> 05:54.876
Does that leave
any permanent damage, or...

05:54.919 --> 05:57.531
Well... can you
taste everything?

05:58.706 --> 06:00.011
No.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.665
You should be fine.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.776
Hey, you know, you're... you're
missing quite a show in there.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.367
No, I'm not.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.587
- I don't have pads there!
- Stop kicking me!

06:10.631 --> 06:13.285
Jai, you've got to stop
bugging people, seriously.

06:13.329 --> 06:14.852
I feel so much shame.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.506
You totally
turned me around on that.

06:16.550 --> 06:17.942
Are we done?

06:17.986 --> 06:19.311
You know, I'm thinking about
getting some fresh air.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.511
I'm gonna go for a run.
You want to join me?

06:21.555 --> 06:23.731
I'm... gonna make myself clear.

06:23.774 --> 06:24.862
Sure.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.908
We're not gonna bond.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.083
Of course we are.

06:28.126 --> 06:30.215
And that way, when you die,

06:30.259 --> 06:31.608
I don't have to
call your parents,

06:31.652 --> 06:33.654
because I won't know
their names.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.700
Well, I'm... I'm not gonna die.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.310
Ever, so...

06:38.354 --> 06:41.096
We're spies, Will.

06:41.139 --> 06:43.359
Do you know
any 60-year-old spies?

06:44.621 --> 06:46.014
Me, neither.

06:46.057 --> 06:47.600
But look, I'm sure there are
other members of the team,

06:47.624 --> 06:49.974
right, who really want
to hear about your past and...

06:50.018 --> 06:52.716
And stories from that perfect
little town you grew up in.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.544
I'm sure it was named
something like

06:54.588 --> 06:56.633
Caucasian Corners or...

06:56.677 --> 06:57.939
WASP-ington.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.636
Huntington, Indiana.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.116
See? I was close.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.249
You were only close
with WASP-ington.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.453
Just 'cause of the "-ington."

07:06.948 --> 07:09.994
Yeah. I think you've had
enough head blows for one day.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.475
Aw, man!

07:13.520 --> 07:15.304
Thank you so much.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.437
Hey. What's going on here?

07:17.480 --> 07:18.742
I asked Frankie

07:18.786 --> 07:20.483
to teach Standish
some fight techniques.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.506
Yeah, I'm the only one
without any combat training.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.923
Whenever we have a physical
confrontation in the field,

07:25.967 --> 07:27.447
I feel like I can barely help.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.579
"Barely" is overstating it.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.755
Calm down, before I have to
kick your ass again.

07:33.191 --> 07:34.279
Okay, kiddo.

07:35.716 --> 07:36.760
Hey, Will,

07:36.804 --> 07:38.458
you think
once I finish my training

07:38.501 --> 07:39.589
I'll be able to run point?

07:39.633 --> 07:40.851
Hold up.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.655
We're supposed to be
co-leaders of this team.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.464
Why are you asking Will?

07:47.510 --> 07:49.469
Will, you want to help me
on this one?

07:49.512 --> 07:51.601
Well...

07:51.645 --> 07:53.473
I gotta... nope. I don't wanna.

07:53.516 --> 07:56.127
I am just as much in charge
as heis, right, Susan?

07:56.171 --> 07:58.216
Back me up here.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.609
Susan?

08:01.002 --> 08:02.699
My God.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.701
Youthink Will's in charge?

08:04.745 --> 08:06.311
No.

08:06.355 --> 08:07.835
No. No.

08:07.878 --> 08:09.706
I... think
it's what you said before.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.536
I think you two are co-leaders.

08:16.670 --> 08:17.671
Good save.

08:19.368 --> 08:21.022
But all
they're really saying is that

08:21.065 --> 08:23.154
something you didn't want
to happen at all...

08:23.198 --> 08:24.678
There you go... has happened.

08:26.549 --> 08:29.030
My store is closing this week.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.510
I own a store...

08:30.553 --> 08:32.554
Do you... know why they think

08:32.599 --> 08:34.688
you'rethe leader of this team?

08:34.731 --> 08:36.907
Shh. This is "You've Got Mail."

08:36.951 --> 08:38.929
I love that you came over
to watch this, by the way.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.669
I came over to talk to you,
and you were already

08:40.693 --> 08:42.019
watching it by yourself
when I got here.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.368
Yeah, but then you said
you'd never seen it,

08:43.392 --> 08:44.761
so that's what tonight's
become about.

08:44.785 --> 08:47.614
Seriously, why do they think
you're the leader?

08:49.137 --> 08:50.537
Really? You're gonna
make me turn...

08:52.793 --> 08:54.664
Okay.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.101
All right, look, um...

08:58.146 --> 08:59.582
Frankie,
you're an amazing agent.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.584
No, get to the part
that I don't already know.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.238
Charming.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.545
You know, in my spare time,

09:05.588 --> 09:06.696
I-I coach
this youth soccer league.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.330
Of course you do.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.693
But at the end of the season,
during our trophy ceremony...

09:10.724 --> 09:11.855
You won the championship?

09:11.899 --> 09:13.378
No, we didn't win a single game,

09:13.422 --> 09:15.206
but I still give
every kid a trophy

09:15.250 --> 09:17.426
for things like,
you know, Most Improved,

09:17.469 --> 09:19.689
Best Dancer, Best Hair...
That kind of thing.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.773
No, I-I don't think
you understand how soccer works.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.781
If you could see
the look on their faces

09:24.825 --> 09:26.217
when they get that trophy...

09:26.261 --> 09:28.611
Leading them is so fulfilling.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.745
You got to realize, you have
the same opportunity right here.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.311
No, you'vegot to realize

09:33.355 --> 09:34.791
that we're not
talking about kids.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.247
We're talking about
government agents

09:36.271 --> 09:37.640
who shouldn't have to
have their hands held

09:37.664 --> 09:38.795
when they have a job to do.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.407
Well, thanks for hearing me out.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.414
Hey, guys. Hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.721
No, he's making me watch
"You've Got Mail" with him.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.244
Making you?

09:53.288 --> 09:55.246
Will, that's ourmovie.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.248
Yes, I'm cheating on you.
How does it feel?

09:57.292 --> 09:58.772
Come on, Ray. What do you want?

09:58.815 --> 10:00.600
Look, I just wanted
to call and say

10:00.643 --> 10:02.906
great job taking down McElroy
in Hong Kong.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.648
Although he wouldn't have gotten
far. Ticker's on the fritz.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.128
Told you
he wasn't looking too good.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.827
Which brings me
to my next point.

10:10.871 --> 10:13.177
McElroy was in the market
for a heart.

10:13.221 --> 10:14.744
Turns out he's been in contact

10:14.788 --> 10:16.790
with this international
organ-harvesting ring

10:16.833 --> 10:19.270
that we have been hunting for
for years.

10:19.314 --> 10:21.664
Now's our chance
to finally take them down.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.493
So pack your bags.

10:24.536 --> 10:25.842
You're headed to the Ukraine.

10:25.886 --> 10:26.974
Copy that.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.631
I'm gonna download this
for the plane.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.806
Good.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.286
All right, listen up.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.680
Our target's Michael Kenner.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.640
Former henchman
turned international terrorist.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.165
His organ harvesting ring
is responsible

10:44.208 --> 10:45.993
for thousands
of missing persons.

10:46.036 --> 10:48.386
His team of mercenaries
hunt the most vulnerable...

10:48.430 --> 10:51.781
refugees, the homeless,
young tourists.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.175
They don't care,
as long as they're healthy.

10:54.218 --> 10:56.220
Wait a second.
Is that that urban legend

10:56.264 --> 10:58.005
where you wake up
in a bathtub full of ice

10:58.048 --> 11:00.311
with a really cool scar
but one less kidney?

11:00.355 --> 11:01.965
Except these people
never wake up.

11:02.009 --> 11:03.706
Every piece of them is harvested

11:03.750 --> 11:05.316
and sold to the highest bidder.

11:07.579 --> 11:08.972
Their customers are CEOs,

11:09.016 --> 11:10.800
drug kingpins, even dictators...

11:10.844 --> 11:12.323
The morally bankrupt elite

11:12.367 --> 11:15.370
who will pay anyprice
to stay alive.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.067
Ethan McElroy
had a meeting scheduled

11:17.111 --> 11:18.503
to purchase his new heart.

11:18.547 --> 11:19.983
Because of his extreme paranoia,

11:20.027 --> 11:21.811
very few people
have seen his face.

11:21.855 --> 11:25.162
So Standish will be
taking this meeting as McElroy.

11:25.206 --> 11:27.227
The plan is to rendezvous
with Kenner's advance team.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.340
We'll flash the cash
so they know that we're legit,

11:29.384 --> 11:31.224
and then they'll schedule
the heart transplant.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.737
His home base in Kiev
is where we take out Kenner

11:34.781 --> 11:36.870
and dismantle his operation.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.741
All right, you ready, "Ethan"?

11:38.785 --> 11:40.700
I don't know...
Does this ugly-ass shirt

11:40.743 --> 11:42.547
make me look like
a paranoid criminal mastermind?

11:42.571 --> 11:43.833
It doesn't matter.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.052
Yes, it does.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.357
I picked it.

11:46.401 --> 11:47.750
Thank you, Jai.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.406
Heads-up.

11:51.449 --> 11:54.104
Our guests are early.

12:08.162 --> 12:09.424
All right, you know the plan.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.208
I'll be in the rafters,
watching your backs.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.427
We got this.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.908
Anything to add, co-leader?

12:14.951 --> 12:16.866
You're adults. Do your job.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.215
Inspiring.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.130
What? You want me
to pick the Coolest Dancer?

12:20.174 --> 12:22.959
No. But if I had to,
it would be Susan.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.003
He's right.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.795
Okay, Ray,
transmitting recon photos now.

12:51.988 --> 12:52.988
You're Ethan?

12:54.164 --> 12:56.819
My mama is the only one
who calls me Ethan.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.909
Youcan call me Mr. McElroy.

12:59.953 --> 13:02.172
This has all of
my updated medical records,

13:02.216 --> 13:05.828
along with a password to access
the other records online.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.569
Password is "KittenKuddles."

13:08.962 --> 13:10.833
"Kuddles" also starts
with a "K."

13:12.139 --> 13:13.314
When do I get my heart?

13:13.357 --> 13:14.619
You got the money?

13:14.663 --> 13:15.664
This guy.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.013
Is an elephant heavy?

13:17.057 --> 13:18.643
Then you best believe
the money is ready.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.842
Jasmine.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.391
Guys, I hate to bust in
on this channel,

13:27.415 --> 13:29.460
but major flag on the play.

13:29.504 --> 13:32.812
We've got a facial recognition
hit on one of the bodyguards.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.945
The big tattoo on his neck,
facial scar, bald dude.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.270
Yeah, he used to work
for McElroy.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.209
He's gonna make Standish
the moment he sees him.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.037
Frankie, Susan,
block his line of sight.

13:45.999 --> 13:48.044
We good?

13:52.005 --> 13:54.007
McElroy.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.140
We will contact you
once we've acquired a donor.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.017
He made you.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.758
No matter what happens next,
do not blow your covers.

14:09.587 --> 14:10.545
My guy.

14:10.588 --> 14:11.588
Hey!

14:14.288 --> 14:15.680
Get McElroy out!

14:20.120 --> 14:21.904
Go, go, go, go!

14:25.603 --> 14:27.736
Go! Let's go! Go!

14:28.955 --> 14:30.478
Why is Will trying to shoot me?!

14:30.521 --> 14:31.934
He's pretendingto shoot you
to protect our cover.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.478
Okay, well,
what's gonna happen to him?

15:16.828 --> 15:19.048
Will, come in. Will?

15:19.092 --> 15:20.702
He's not answering.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.680
I'm trying to find the car.
I could use something to go on.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.769
You're the one
who saw the car. It was a black sedan.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.273
Do you know how many people in
this country have a black sedan?

15:36.544 --> 15:38.241
Will, can you hear me?! Will!

15:38.285 --> 15:39.939
Aah! Too loud!

15:39.982 --> 15:42.178
Guys, sorry. Call off the search.
We don't want to hurt his ears.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.812
Will, we're in pursuit,

15:43.855 --> 15:45.640
but we need some help
finding you.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.120
All right. Copy that.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.125
Feels like we just went over
some train tracks.

15:53.648 --> 15:56.259
That matches a stretch of road
up ahead. Keep right.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.878
And we just made the transition

16:06.922 --> 16:09.011
from regular road
to cobblestones.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.492
Cobblestones... cobblestones...

16:11.535 --> 16:13.015
There. Turn left.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.161
I think we may be
in the Village.

16:28.204 --> 16:29.336
I can hear some music.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.126
Guitar guy... right there!

16:37.170 --> 16:38.649
Okay. We're close.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.741
Who's behind the wheel?
Is that Jai?

16:43.785 --> 16:45.004
That is correct.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.092
Jai!

16:46.135 --> 16:47.571
Did your dad
teach you how to drive

16:47.615 --> 16:48.746
when you were a kid?

16:48.790 --> 16:50.139
What was his name?

16:50.183 --> 16:51.749
Really? Now?
You want to do this now?

16:51.793 --> 16:53.229
Well...

17:02.760 --> 17:04.935
We'd love to know
what car you're in, Will.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.156
Yeah. I'm already
way ahead of you.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.723
Look for the sedan...

17:09.767 --> 17:11.160
whose hazards are flashing.

17:16.644 --> 17:17.644
There.

17:19.386 --> 17:20.604
Hold on.

17:22.301 --> 17:24.868
Jai, don't you dare lose him.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.088
Not gonna happen.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.618
Heads-up... you've been made.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.757
Yeah, I don't do well
in car chases.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.112
Whoo! This is like
driving in Mumbai!

18:01.515 --> 18:02.733
Jai, there's a car.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.126
Jai, Jai, Jai, there's a car!

18:06.259 --> 18:08.261
God! Remind me
to never go to Mumbai with you!

18:09.349 --> 18:10.741
Go! Go, go, go!
We almost have him!

18:13.483 --> 18:14.832
Damn it!

18:19.185 --> 18:20.229
Aah!

18:20.273 --> 18:21.752
Damn! My ass, Jai!

18:21.796 --> 18:24.755
Would you please stop
freaking out about everything?

18:31.980 --> 18:33.286
Guys, there goes the car!

18:33.329 --> 18:34.635
Hurry up! Move, bitch!

18:34.678 --> 18:36.289
Get out the way! Get out the way!

18:39.292 --> 18:40.292
We'll find him.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.261
There he is.

18:52.305 --> 18:53.804
You guys stay here,
preserve your covers.

18:53.828 --> 18:54.829
I'll go get him.

19:03.316 --> 19:06.275
Come out of the car slowly,
with your hands raised!

19:06.319 --> 19:07.320
Now!

19:20.507 --> 19:21.595
He's gone.

19:23.771 --> 19:24.771
What?

19:38.351 --> 19:39.352
They switched cars.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.095
We'll get him back.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.184
Don't worry.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.017
We'll get you back, Will.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.673
Look at this guy?

19:56.717 --> 19:59.023
Hey. You look healthy.

19:59.067 --> 20:01.417
Healthy like money.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.419
And I likemoney.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.682
They will pay a lot for you.

20:05.726 --> 20:08.685
Every... last... piece.

20:38.976 --> 20:40.413
I've cleared it with Europol.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.545
All of their resources
are at your disposal.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.915
Great. Frankie, what can we do to help?
Nothing. I've got this.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.482
Really? Because I can... I
can get in one of these...

20:46.506 --> 20:48.440
Get me all CCTV footage
within 10 klicks of the hangar.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.291
Done.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.423
All right, listen up.

20:50.466 --> 20:51.815
Will's comms are still active.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.556
Come on.

20:55.428 --> 20:57.430
I boosted the signal.

21:00.607 --> 21:01.912
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!

21:01.956 --> 21:03.305
Cold hands, buddy.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.612
Yeah, why don't you go
sit on those for a bit?

21:05.655 --> 21:07.440
Yeah.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.268
It's gonna be a long day
for you.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.487
Hey, I want to thank you
for the free checkup,

21:11.531 --> 21:13.968
but your,
your staff at this hospital...

21:14.011 --> 21:15.622
Horrible bedside manner.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.754
Andtwo hours from downtown?

21:17.798 --> 21:19.147
So inconvenient.

21:20.148 --> 21:21.280
Good job, Will.

21:22.629 --> 21:23.847
Two hours' drive.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.328
Okay, that means
we're within this radius.

21:26.372 --> 21:27.784
If the satellite flights
are timed...

21:27.808 --> 21:29.940
Shh. I'm... I'm thinking.
You do what you do.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.337
Who are you working for?

21:35.381 --> 21:37.774
And how much do you know
about my operation?

21:37.818 --> 21:39.341
I don't know anything about you.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.038
I was paid to take out McElroy.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.432
You're a merc?

21:43.476 --> 21:44.781
I used to be you...

21:44.825 --> 21:47.480
Getting paid $60-, $70K
to take out some target.

21:47.523 --> 21:49.395
Maybe getting yourself killed
in the process?

21:50.483 --> 21:51.788
Fool's game.

21:51.832 --> 21:54.617
Now, this,
my little chop shop...

21:54.661 --> 21:56.358
We snatch them up,
bring them in,

21:56.402 --> 21:58.621
take them apart...

21:58.665 --> 22:01.232
Minimum effort, maximum profit.

22:02.495 --> 22:05.019
Sounds great. You hiring?

22:05.062 --> 22:08.239
Yeah, I'm afraid we don't
currently have any openings.

22:08.283 --> 22:09.502
Really?

22:09.545 --> 22:11.330
What about the guy
with the scar on his face

22:11.373 --> 22:12.505
that I took out?

22:14.681 --> 22:17.248
Unfortunately for you,

22:17.292 --> 22:18.989
that was a close friend of mine.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.295
Aw, I'm sorry.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.389
Clever boy.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.655
I assume
this is the well-dressed

22:32.699 --> 22:35.092
bearded gentleman
from the alley.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.487
Don't bother
trying to find your partner.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.054
He'll be dead soon.

22:48.105 --> 22:50.412
Hey, for fun,

22:50.456 --> 22:52.414
let's test how strong
that heart is.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.355
Have a great day.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.453
We got to do something.

23:31.497 --> 23:32.715
Yeah, you think?

23:32.759 --> 23:34.325
Hey! Easy.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.720
Okay, um...

23:37.764 --> 23:39.766
this is a long shot,
but I might have...

23:39.809 --> 23:41.028
s-something.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.554
I-I mean,
he's gonna be okay, right?

23:45.598 --> 23:47.469
What do you want me to say?

23:47.513 --> 23:48.905
That everything's gonna be fine?

23:48.949 --> 23:50.559
That somehow,
with no clear lead,

23:50.603 --> 23:52.082
we're miraculously
gonna find Will

23:52.126 --> 23:54.476
before these butchers
cut him apart?

23:54.520 --> 23:57.479
Yeah, yeah, everything
is gonna be great!

23:57.523 --> 23:58.959
Everybody feel better now?

24:04.051 --> 24:05.618
Idon't.

24:10.623 --> 24:12.494
Look.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.496
I know that you are
used to being on your own.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.280
You've been on your own
for a long time,

24:16.324 --> 24:18.631
and you're not
used to leading a team.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.696
That's why I gave you a push
and asked you to train Standish.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.982
Which isn't going anywhere,

24:22.025 --> 24:23.394
because I can't even
get through to him.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.115
Yes. You can, Frankie.

24:25.159 --> 24:26.465
You are.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.292
You can lead us.
You've got it in you.

24:28.336 --> 24:29.511
Ithink so.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.165
Willthinks so.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.518
What does he know, anyway?

24:38.868 --> 24:40.479
What are we gonna do?

24:40.522 --> 24:42.524
How are we gonna
get him back? Because...

24:44.047 --> 24:46.615
I mean, it's not like
they're gonna call us.

24:50.576 --> 24:51.620
You have an idea.

24:51.664 --> 24:52.969
Is this an idea face?

24:53.013 --> 24:54.318
It's an idea face.

24:54.362 --> 24:55.494
I love idea face.

25:22.564 --> 25:23.870
Jai.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.567
Yes! Found you.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.090
I'm betting you can hear me

25:27.134 --> 25:29.397
because I'm pretty sure
that you bugged me.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.704
Even though I told you
to stop doing that.

25:31.747 --> 25:35.664
Well, if I can't hearyou,
you can hopefully hearme.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.710
Knowing you,
it's got to be microscopic...

25:37.753 --> 25:39.755
Maybe on a button or...

25:39.799 --> 25:41.278
rivet on my jeans...

25:42.105 --> 25:43.280
Yeah, it's in the jeans.

25:44.934 --> 25:47.371
You know, for once, I'm actually
happy that you bug everyone.

25:47.415 --> 25:48.416
So am I.

25:48.459 --> 25:50.679
Just... I wish
you could hear me.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.551
Um...

25:52.594 --> 25:54.553
no obvious escape plan.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.618
I was blindfolded the whole
time, so I can't tell you much.

25:56.642 --> 25:59.427
The building looks old.

25:59.470 --> 26:01.211
Maybe former military.

26:01.255 --> 26:04.388
I cantell you that
there are other captives here...

26:04.432 --> 26:05.607
A lot of kids.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.609
So, regardless
of whether you guys

26:07.653 --> 26:09.568
make it to me in time or not,

26:09.611 --> 26:11.700
you've got to get them out.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.441
Look, in the meantime...

26:15.356 --> 26:17.619
this is a pretty good
opportunity for us to bond.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.273
God.

26:19.316 --> 26:21.754
Where do I begin, though, is...

26:21.797 --> 26:23.582
All right.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.148
William Stoddard Chase.

26:25.192 --> 26:27.063
I'm the youngest of three.

26:27.107 --> 26:29.500
My parents have been
married for almost 50 years.

26:29.544 --> 26:30.719
W-we're super close.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.721
I mean, holidays at my house
are magical.

26:32.765 --> 26:34.636
Of course they are.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.898
We carol. We sing.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.639
We're big singers,
my family is. We're...

26:37.683 --> 26:39.772
You'll learn that later.
You'll come over.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.993
Man, I really hope
I get to see another Christmas.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.693
Mostly for my folks.

26:48.694 --> 26:49.825
My...

26:51.000 --> 26:53.481
My older brother Kevin
was a Marine.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.352
He was killed in Afghanistan.

26:57.964 --> 27:00.662
I don't want them to have to
go through that again.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.625
Look, Jai, if everything
goes sideways here,

27:06.668 --> 27:08.539
my parents are Richard and Lori.

27:08.583 --> 27:11.673
Do me a favor
and explain to them that...

27:19.550 --> 27:21.814
Just tell them that they were
always on my mind.

27:22.989 --> 27:25.208
And that I did my best.

27:30.866 --> 27:32.955
And that I love them.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.133
Thanks, Jai.

27:42.443 --> 27:44.793
Okay, thanks to Will
keeping your cover,

27:44.837 --> 27:46.534
they still think
"Ethan" is out there

27:46.577 --> 27:48.492
and in desperate need
of a transplant.

27:48.536 --> 27:49.798
That's our in.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.844
We're gonna have them
give you Will's heart.

27:51.887 --> 27:53.846
Okay. Cool.

27:53.889 --> 27:56.326
Quick question, though...
Doesn't Will need it?

27:56.370 --> 27:57.806
It's our quickest way
to find him,

27:57.850 --> 28:00.200
and we're running out of time.

28:00.243 --> 28:01.767
Okay, um...

28:01.810 --> 28:03.745
what do you want me to change
about Ethan's medical records?

28:03.769 --> 28:05.596
His blood type
and tissue antigens.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.207
Will's blood type is O positive,

28:07.250 --> 28:10.123
and HLAA1-B8-DR17.

28:12.255 --> 28:15.389
I'm his "in case of emergency,
please contact" person, so...

28:15.432 --> 28:16.825
That's adorable.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.261
Well, we're besties.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.352
Okay, my...

28:22.396 --> 28:24.528
Ethan'smedical records
have been updated. Now what?

28:24.572 --> 28:26.898
Send a message. Say that we're getting
desperate and you'll pay double.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.054
You think that'll work?

28:28.097 --> 28:29.403
Do I have a crystal ball?

28:32.798 --> 28:34.713
I'm sorry.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.845
I'm here for you,
and I'm hopeful.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.605
And if there's one thing
that I know for sure,

28:38.629 --> 28:39.868
it's that criminals are greedy.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.197
Let's try it.

28:49.466 --> 28:51.642
Okay. Kenner's people responded.
We're in.

28:52.905 --> 28:55.951
Ray, you and Jai be
our eyes and ears on the ground.

28:55.995 --> 28:56.909
Let's move.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.867
Let's do it.

28:58.911 --> 29:00.521
Roger that. Copy.

29:01.478 --> 29:03.785
Now, look, I'm not saying
I was a chubbykid

29:03.829 --> 29:05.047
in high school, right?

29:05.091 --> 29:06.570
I mean... although I did have

29:06.614 --> 29:08.070
a pretty intense relationship
with carbs.

29:08.094 --> 29:09.878
Pizza, pasta.

29:09.922 --> 29:12.402
Sometimes pasta onpizza.

29:12.446 --> 29:14.056
Wrapped in bread.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.102
Sometimes I just had
bread with mayonnaise on it.

29:16.145 --> 29:18.626
But, look, team sports saved me.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.671
I developed
a close group of friends,

29:20.715 --> 29:23.065
learned how to interact with
people, connect with people.

29:23.109 --> 29:25.546
That is why I'm really hoping
we get to go on that run.

29:26.939 --> 29:28.897
We have to save you.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.681
So then I can kill you.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.466
Going jogging with someone, Jai,

29:32.509 --> 29:34.990
that's the perfect opportunity
to really bond.

29:38.298 --> 29:40.256
You're awake.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.258
You're a lot tougher
than I thought.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.826
Well, you know, I try
to eat right, get enough sleep.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.003
Funny story.
I think you'll appreciate it.

29:48.047 --> 29:50.266
Your heart is going
to the very man

29:50.310 --> 29:51.702
you were hired to kill.

29:51.746 --> 29:52.791
Wow.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.798
Well, if that was
a flu shot, thank you.

29:59.841 --> 30:02.365
I've just given you
a slow-acting paralytic.

30:02.409 --> 30:05.325
The paralysis will
overtake you gradually.

30:05.368 --> 30:08.632
Of course, you'll still feel
everything when we cut into you.

30:08.676 --> 30:10.025
Can't wait.

30:11.244 --> 30:12.985
Guys, time's running out.

30:16.379 --> 30:18.164
We're here.

30:18.207 --> 30:21.123
Have Ray coordinate a satellite
above our exact location.

30:28.522 --> 30:29.828
Jasmine.

30:35.616 --> 30:37.400
You know what they say.

30:39.011 --> 30:40.969
Money can buy you happiness.

30:42.101 --> 30:43.058
Nyet.

30:43.102 --> 30:44.190
They don't say that.

30:44.233 --> 30:45.191
I do.

30:45.234 --> 30:46.514
Now, where the hell is my heart?

32:56.496 --> 32:58.846
You can take my blood,
but I want my damn cookie after.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.153
Prepare the sedative.

33:01.196 --> 33:03.024
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.504
Where exactly is my donor?

33:04.547 --> 33:05.940
I don't want some heart

33:05.984 --> 33:08.049
that's been sitting in a fridge,
getting freezer burn.

33:08.073 --> 33:10.466
I want a guarantee that
this thing is farm-to-table,

33:10.510 --> 33:12.164
or the deal is off.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.734
Your donor is downstairs,
in the operating room,

33:17.778 --> 33:19.345
and is being prepped
as we speak.

33:19.388 --> 33:20.824
Thanks for the info.

33:20.868 --> 33:21.868
What...

33:33.359 --> 33:35.665
Thanks. I, wasn't much help.

33:35.709 --> 33:36.709
No.

33:38.755 --> 33:40.148
Look.

33:40.192 --> 33:42.150
You aren't
a good fighter... yet.

33:42.194 --> 33:43.760
So use what you're good at...

33:43.804 --> 33:46.024
Deception, screaming, surprise.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.070
Okay.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.204
I am so proud. I am...

33:52.247 --> 33:53.355
I don't want to talk about it.

33:53.379 --> 33:55.076
Do we know what the plan is?

33:55.120 --> 33:56.512
I'm gonna free the hostages.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.601
And I'm gonna help you
go get Will.

33:58.645 --> 33:59.907
Good.

34:03.911 --> 34:05.043
I'd watch your step.

34:19.274 --> 34:20.319
Drop your gun.

34:20.362 --> 34:21.929
You drop yourgun. What?

34:21.972 --> 34:24.931
I don't even think you...
You can lift your arm.

34:24.975 --> 34:26.194
Maybe I can't.

34:26.237 --> 34:28.283
Then again, maybe I'm doing
everything I can

34:28.327 --> 34:31.199
to stop myself from killing you
right where you stand.

34:31.243 --> 34:32.547
And on that topic,

34:32.592 --> 34:35.203
I have actually
shot my gun before.

34:35.246 --> 34:36.596
And you're a doctor.

34:36.639 --> 34:37.945
I'm willing to wager money

34:37.987 --> 34:39.987
that you've never even
pulled the trigger on yours.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.993
Y-You're bluffing.

34:43.036 --> 34:45.953
Maybe I ambluffing.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.650
Then again...

34:47.694 --> 34:49.087
maybe...

34:51.263 --> 34:52.438
maybe I'm fine.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.399
Will!

34:59.619 --> 35:01.664
What are you doing?

35:01.708 --> 35:02.752
I can't move.

35:02.796 --> 35:05.103
I'm-a hug you anyway.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.582
Okay. Excuse me, sir.

35:06.626 --> 35:08.149
There it is.

35:08.193 --> 35:09.324
Nice.

35:10.847 --> 35:12.153
Okay, listen up.

35:12.197 --> 35:14.286
I need you to move
very quickly to that door.

35:14.329 --> 35:15.765
Keep moving.

35:15.809 --> 35:17.767
Let's go. You're free.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.251
Yeah?

35:23.295 --> 35:25.645
Come on. You're safe now.

35:30.171 --> 35:32.173
You're welcome, by the way.

35:32.217 --> 35:35.045
For what? I was
just about to save myself.

35:35.089 --> 35:37.265
I mean, you know,
as soon as I could walk again.

35:37.309 --> 35:38.701
Okay.

35:38.745 --> 35:39.963
Gown suits you.

35:40.007 --> 35:41.704
Yeah, not if you see it
from behind.

35:41.748 --> 35:43.706
You may have
the world's palest ass.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.273
Frankie, you should see it.

35:45.317 --> 35:46.796
Yeah, I think I'm good.

35:46.840 --> 35:47.971
Please.

35:48.015 --> 35:50.452
I think I saw you
check it out earlier.

35:50.496 --> 35:51.627
I didn't.

35:51.671 --> 35:53.194
I assure you, I did not.

35:53.238 --> 35:54.978
I think you did,
and I think you liked it.

35:55.022 --> 35:56.739
Well, I can't like it
if I didn't look at it.

35:56.763 --> 35:58.480
Look, all this "hate flirting"
is mesmerizing,

35:58.504 --> 36:00.308
but can we put it on pause
until we get out of here?

36:00.332 --> 36:01.985
Jai, can you help us
find Kenner?

36:02.029 --> 36:04.292
Yep. We have eyes
from the satellite.

36:04.336 --> 36:05.859
They're heading towards
the helicopter.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.687
Kenner's a sociopath.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.708
If he gets away, he'll just
set up shop somewhere else.

36:09.732 --> 36:10.820
He'll never stop.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.170
Well, what if we makeit stop?

36:12.213 --> 36:13.997
You up for this?

36:15.695 --> 36:16.696
Yeah.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.177
I'm probably gonna
need some pants.

36:22.354 --> 36:24.486
You're up, Standish.
Take out that helicopter.

36:24.530 --> 36:25.922
Okay. I'm in position.

36:40.415 --> 36:41.460
All right, you ready?

36:48.728 --> 36:50.512
Get the lead out! Come on!

37:03.177 --> 37:05.266
If you don't want to die,
come out now.

37:05.310 --> 37:06.354
It's over.

37:06.398 --> 37:08.617
Kenner, step out quietly.

37:13.405 --> 37:14.405
Yeah.

37:15.494 --> 37:16.973
"Quietly" isn't really me.

37:20.934 --> 37:23.850
Either I walk away or we alldie.

37:25.417 --> 37:26.418
Surprise, bitch!

37:26.461 --> 37:28.376
Aah!

37:28.420 --> 37:29.943
Ha ha!

37:31.466 --> 37:33.120
Ha... ha!

37:33.163 --> 37:34.382
I owed him.

37:34.426 --> 37:35.427
Nice job.

37:35.470 --> 37:37.385
Thank you!

37:37.429 --> 37:40.388
Now, quick question... what am I
supposed to do with this?

37:40.432 --> 37:42.085
- Ooh.
- Hey, Will?

37:42.129 --> 37:43.237
We're gonna talk about this.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.915
You... find the pin,
is what you do.

37:45.959 --> 37:47.265
Find the pin. Find the pin.

37:47.308 --> 37:48.309
Yep. It's a good game.

37:48.353 --> 37:49.353
The pin.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.314
To being home!

37:53.358 --> 37:55.098
Yes, with no missing parts.

37:55.142 --> 37:58.058
I never want to make that call
to Richard and Lori.

37:59.364 --> 38:00.495
You remembered.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.280
That was a moment.
We just had a moment.

38:03.455 --> 38:04.499
Okay, I'm gonna go.

38:04.543 --> 38:06.022
Where are you going? Not sure yet.

38:06.066 --> 38:07.110
Come on.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.418
Boy.

38:10.462 --> 38:12.464
Whiskey! You're back!

38:12.507 --> 38:14.335
Whoo!

38:14.379 --> 38:15.336
No, no, no, no.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.947
No, no. Okay. That's all right.

38:19.471 --> 38:21.299
Listen, I, um...

38:21.342 --> 38:22.952
I just want you to know
that I'm...

38:22.996 --> 38:24.954
really glad that you're okay.

38:24.998 --> 38:26.652
Thank you.

38:26.695 --> 38:28.369
And so, maybe we could have,
like, a guys' night.

38:28.393 --> 38:29.979
You know? We could watch,
"You've Got Mail"...

38:30.003 --> 38:31.265
Okay. You're done.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.789
'Cause that's ourmovie,
not yours.

38:33.833 --> 38:35.443
Okay. Bye. It's ours!

38:37.489 --> 38:38.446
Hey.

38:38.490 --> 38:40.535
I just wanted to say thank you

38:40.579 --> 38:41.971
for the pep talk the other day.

38:42.015 --> 38:44.322
I didn't know I could do that.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.542
I always knew you had it in you.

38:47.586 --> 38:48.848
No, you didn't.

38:48.891 --> 38:50.545
You're right.

38:50.589 --> 38:51.633
But...

38:51.677 --> 38:53.331
I'm proud of you.

38:53.374 --> 38:54.699
We'll start training
again tomorrow.

38:54.723 --> 38:56.072
Yeah.

38:56.116 --> 38:57.857
I, can't wait.

38:57.900 --> 38:58.988
Anybody want to play pool?

38:59.032 --> 39:00.512
No? Anybody?

39:00.555 --> 39:01.382
Nah.

39:01.426 --> 39:02.688
Playing pool by myself.

39:05.038 --> 39:06.169
What?

39:06.213 --> 39:08.389
That was your "trophy ceremony."

39:08.433 --> 39:10.348
Seriously, nice job.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.219
You stepped up
and you led the team.

39:13.525 --> 39:15.918
I guess I owe a thank-you to
the person who gave me a push.

39:17.311 --> 39:19.357
I appreciate it,
but you do not have to thank me.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.551
I was just doing
part of my job as co...

39:20.575 --> 39:22.403
Susan, thank you.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.187
It's what I do.

39:24.231 --> 39:26.015
No. Wha... She always
knew I had it in me.

39:26.059 --> 39:27.321
I did.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.279
I... No. Isaid that.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.301
I said... literally, word
for word, I said that to you.

39:31.325 --> 39:33.414
I'm sure I would've remembered.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.503
What?

39:35.547 --> 39:37.200
W-Where is everybody going?

39:37.244 --> 39:38.724
I almost died, people!

39:44.251 --> 39:45.905
Good morning, Agent Chase!

39:45.948 --> 39:48.429
If you're wondering
what time it is, it's 300 AM.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.562
Now, since I had to
listen to you

39:50.605 --> 39:53.391
prattle on and on
about your life

39:53.434 --> 39:55.523
for just... hours...

39:55.567 --> 39:58.526
I thought it was only fair
that I did the same.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.223
So, come on, Will.

40:00.267 --> 40:01.921
Let's bond.

40:01.964 --> 40:05.533
I was born Jai Amitabh Datta
in Jamshedpur, India...

40:05.577 --> 40:07.622
Wait. This should be deeper.

40:07.666 --> 40:10.930
But I moved to the U.S.
when I was 5.

40:10.973 --> 40:15.543
My favorite ice cream
is mint chocolate chip,

40:15.587 --> 40:17.545
but not the green kind.

40:17.589 --> 40:19.895
We're bonding.

40:19.939 --> 40:22.570
I'm exhausted, Jai, so I'm gonna
have to take a rain check on this,

40:22.594 --> 40:24.117
but, thanks, pal.

40:25.553 --> 40:26.467
Yeah, no. Afraid not.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.077
My mom, Priya, is a chef.

40:28.121 --> 40:29.905
My dad, Gupreet, is a doctor.

40:29.949 --> 40:32.342
And I don't care
about any of that,

40:32.386 --> 40:33.692
because when I was 8,

40:33.735 --> 40:35.433
I discovered
their movie collection

40:35.476 --> 40:38.305
and became enchanted
by the magic...

40:39.306 --> 40:41.308
of Bollywood.

40:41.351 --> 40:42.570
Cue music.

40:50.883 --> 40:54.016
My favorite film...
"Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi," 1958.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.018
Let me tell you
all about it, Will...

40:56.062 --> 40:58.020
In detail.

40:58.064 --> 41:00.022
The plot,
at an existential level,

41:00.066 --> 41:01.633
is about the search
for happiness.

41:01.676 --> 41:04.287
But can we
really define happiness?

41:04.331 --> 41:06.333
Let's try, Will... tonight.
