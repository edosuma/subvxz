WEBVTT

00:43.593 --> 00:45.695
Every spot looks the same.

00:47.397 --> 00:49.666
At least that last campsite
had electricity and...

00:49.699 --> 00:50.534
People?

00:51.434 --> 00:52.435
We're people.

00:53.436 --> 00:54.205
Okay.

00:54.238 --> 00:55.572
It's not camping
if you're staring

00:55.605 --> 00:57.707
into somebody else's tent.

00:57.741 --> 01:00.477
You never know what could
be going on in there.

01:00.510 --> 01:02.814
There's too many damn
people in the world.

01:02.847 --> 01:04.648
Can we please just get there?

01:06.583 --> 01:09.754
She reverts to behaving
like a child just to annoy me.

01:11.454 --> 01:13.523
I think this wilderness
trip is gonna do you

01:13.557 --> 01:15.592
both a whole lot of good.

01:54.899 --> 01:59.904
Thank God we're here, I guess.

02:07.510 --> 02:08.511
Wow,

02:09.479 --> 02:09.981
it's peaceful.

02:12.016 --> 02:12.917
Yup.

02:15.753 --> 02:19.556
Okay, ladies, we got
a lot of work to do.

02:19.589 --> 02:20.958
Come on, let's get going.

02:20.992 --> 02:22.894
It's really pretty nice, Dad.

02:22.927 --> 02:24.896
Yeah, I
thought you'd like it.

02:24.929 --> 02:26.663
Emily, come and help me.

02:26.696 --> 02:28.632
Can I relax for a second?

02:28.665 --> 02:30.700
We've been driving for hours.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.636
It's really not fair.

02:32.669 --> 02:34.671
You know what,
life's not fair.

02:34.704 --> 02:35.973
I realize that.

02:36.007 --> 02:38.575
Good, then I'm doing my job.

02:38.608 --> 02:39.310
You sure have.

02:39.343 --> 02:41.012
Please do what
I ask you to do.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.015
I don't think
she's gonna make it.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.817
Well, I'm not.

02:46.851 --> 02:49.586
Okay, we will give
her a sedative later.

02:49.619 --> 02:53.523
Right now, we gotta
unpack all this stuff.

02:53.556 --> 02:54.892
Get ready to set up the tents.

02:54.926 --> 02:55.760
Okay with that?

02:55.793 --> 02:56.626
Yep.

02:56.660 --> 02:57.694
Good.

02:59.562 --> 03:02.033
Okay, join the short
corded pulls together.

03:02.066 --> 03:03.433
Okay.

03:03.968 --> 03:04.936
Put these together.

03:06.070 --> 03:10.808
I think this is the pull.

03:10.841 --> 03:13.443
You need some help?

03:17.514 --> 03:19.649
Stick it through this.

03:19.683 --> 03:20.851
Look at these two.

03:20.885 --> 03:21.786
Mom, you need to
set up your tent.

03:25.056 --> 03:28.525
Why are we setting up
tents where we have an RV?

03:28.558 --> 03:31.062
Because there's nothing like
sleeping out under the stars,

03:31.095 --> 03:32.529
that's why.

03:32.562 --> 03:33.931
After you've finished your pout,

03:33.965 --> 03:37.534
would you collect some wood
for the campfire, please?

03:44.308 --> 03:45.977
What do you do if
you see a bear?

03:46.010 --> 03:47.912
Scream in panic.

03:47.945 --> 03:50.513
She'll lecture it about
life until it runs away.

03:51.849 --> 03:53.017
You play dead.

04:34.058 --> 04:35.760
Did I tell you this story?

04:35.793 --> 04:36.726
Yeah.

04:36.761 --> 04:37.660
Hey, this place looks great.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.829
You guys make a good team.

04:40.798 --> 04:44.634
So, you're just in time.

04:44.667 --> 04:45.836
Just in time for what?

04:49.874 --> 04:51.942
Wow, this is beautiful, dad.

04:53.878 --> 04:54.779
Smell that air.

04:55.745 --> 04:57.014
I know.

04:57.048 --> 04:59.917
Have you ever seen
so many pine trees?

04:59.950 --> 05:00.818
No.

05:02.987 --> 05:03.988
Me either.

05:07.657 --> 05:09.360
Here, hold on.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.194
I'm good, I'm good.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.662
All right, I'm
here if you need me.

05:12.695 --> 05:13.696
Just get ready to fish.

05:18.235 --> 05:22.940
The fish won't bite if they
smell your scent, okay?

05:22.973 --> 05:24.775
That looks like it hurts.

05:24.809 --> 05:26.576
No, it doesn't hurt me at all.

05:28.179 --> 05:30.081
I don't wanna kill a worm.

05:30.114 --> 05:32.850
Emily, how are you
ever gonna survive?

05:32.883 --> 05:34.118
Not by fishing.

05:35.718 --> 05:38.089
We're not gonna
eat what we catch.

05:38.122 --> 05:38.956
Right, dad.

05:38.989 --> 05:39.957
Why not?

05:39.990 --> 05:41.158
We have to have dinner.

05:41.192 --> 05:42.960
Dad, I'm sure the
fish in this river

05:42.993 --> 05:44.228
are contaminated with lead

05:44.261 --> 05:46.397
or mercury or something.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.399
She thinks the whole
world is screwed up.

05:48.432 --> 05:50.633
No, I just don't think
we should eat them.

05:52.136 --> 05:53.104
How about eating a worm?

05:53.137 --> 05:54.205
Ooh, gross.

05:54.238 --> 05:56.774
Emily, stop it, I mean it.

05:58.075 --> 05:58.943
You're no fun.

06:02.446 --> 06:05.682
She's not like this
when she needs money.

06:08.018 --> 06:10.620
Will you just try
to have a good time.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.623
You have to get past
the recent setback.

06:14.691 --> 06:17.228
Dad, I lost everything.

06:17.261 --> 06:19.763
The business wiped me out.

06:19.797 --> 06:22.632
I mean, we are living
month to month.

06:23.367 --> 06:25.635
I don't even know what
I'm gonna do next.

06:26.804 --> 06:29.672
You know, when
you become a parent,

06:29.706 --> 06:33.043
you realize that
there are no adults.

06:34.078 --> 06:36.280
Everybody is just pretending.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.149
Everybody tells you, you know,

06:38.182 --> 06:39.083
they think they know
what they're doing,

06:39.116 --> 06:40.117
but they don't.

06:40.151 --> 06:41.252
They're just bullshitting.

06:41.285 --> 06:44.221
So you have to start pretending.

06:44.255 --> 06:47.458
You have to pretend for Emily.

06:47.491 --> 06:49.659
That's just great, dad.

06:50.794 --> 06:52.096
Things will be
better next time.

06:52.630 --> 06:55.032
I've run out of next times.

06:55.065 --> 07:00.070
It seems like everything I try
to do just doesn't work out.

07:02.139 --> 07:03.073
Don't lose hope.

07:04.141 --> 07:07.178
Hope doesn't pay the rent,

07:07.211 --> 07:09.712
doesn't do my car payments.

07:09.746 --> 07:11.182
Now you're the one pretending.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.752
I don't know what
else to tell you.

07:14.785 --> 07:15.286
Okay.

07:17.521 --> 07:18.923
I need to borrow
some more money.

07:18.956 --> 07:21.058
I know I promised
that I wouldn't.

07:22.826 --> 07:24.762
It's okay.

07:24.795 --> 07:26.931
We'll talk about
that later, okay?

07:26.964 --> 07:30.000
Right now, I have
to take a piss.

07:30.034 --> 07:31.068
Okay?

07:31.101 --> 07:32.269
Whoa!

07:32.303 --> 07:36.106
I'm guessing there are no
actual fish in this river.

07:36.140 --> 07:40.177
Well, they're not gonna just
leave off onto your plate.

07:40.211 --> 07:42.712
You have to work hard for them.

07:43.347 --> 07:44.714
Okay, mom.

08:02.366 --> 08:03.733
Hello.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.809
You need to leave.

08:11.842 --> 08:12.309
You startled me.

08:12.343 --> 08:13.244
Who are you?

08:13.277 --> 08:15.312
You're on private property.

08:15.346 --> 08:17.815
Please pack up your things

08:17.848 --> 08:19.049
and find another place to camp.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.251
Well, we just got here.

08:20.284 --> 08:22.186
Couldn't we at
least stay the night

08:22.219 --> 08:23.220
and leave in the morning.

08:23.254 --> 08:24.555
I can't.

08:24.588 --> 08:25.856
You'll have to leave.

08:27.925 --> 08:28.792
Thanks.

08:30.961 --> 08:31.895
What's happening.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.564
He's kicking us out.

08:33.597 --> 08:34.398
Why?

08:34.431 --> 08:35.866
It's private property.

08:35.899 --> 08:38.102
Oh, sir, we
didn't see any signs

08:38.135 --> 08:39.036
or we never would have...

08:39.069 --> 08:40.804
Sir, it's gonna get dark soon.

08:40.838 --> 08:41.772
I said no.

08:43.207 --> 08:44.575
There are plenty of campgrounds

08:44.608 --> 08:46.910
about 10 miles south
of the main road.

08:49.913 --> 08:51.782
I'm asking you nicely to leave.

08:56.153 --> 08:58.155
Well, that was kind of rude.

08:58.188 --> 09:00.157
Why do you always
have to interrupt me

09:00.190 --> 09:01.792
every time I speak?

09:02.926 --> 09:05.596
Okay, anyway,
it's his property.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.231
We have to go.

09:07.264 --> 09:09.133
Great, now I have to
pack all the shit back up.

09:09.166 --> 09:10.034
Emily.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.937
Dad, stop, stop, stop.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.073
You're stuck, you're stuck.

09:17.941 --> 09:20.944
Oh my God, I hate camping.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.846
I hate the outdoors.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.181
There's no phone,

09:24.214 --> 09:25.249
there are no people around.

09:25.282 --> 09:28.185
Oh, except of course for
the creepy guy with a gun.

09:29.386 --> 09:31.955
Mom's freaking out again.

09:33.090 --> 09:35.092
I hate pine cones,
they're useless.

09:36.927 --> 09:38.295
What are we gonna do?

09:38.329 --> 09:39.196
Ah shit.

09:40.064 --> 09:41.932
We're stuck.

09:41.965 --> 09:42.733
I can see that.

09:42.767 --> 09:45.102
You just calmed
down, all right.

09:45.135 --> 09:47.304
Now what we need
is you to collect

09:47.338 --> 09:49.206
some flat pieces of wood.

09:49.239 --> 09:50.207
Can you do that?

09:50.240 --> 09:51.342
Emily.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.477
Emily, make yourself useful,

09:53.510 --> 09:54.912
go and help your mom.

10:17.935 --> 10:19.470
Is that gonna hold it?

10:19.503 --> 10:20.437
No, obviously not.

10:20.471 --> 10:22.339
This is a wrong jack.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.274
God damn it.

10:27.978 --> 10:29.446
Just put those under the tire.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.181
Why don't we just call AAA.

10:32.516 --> 10:34.151
I'm kidding.

10:34.184 --> 10:35.953
Okay, where are those
plaid pieces of wood

10:35.986 --> 10:36.453
I told you to get?

10:36.487 --> 10:37.321
I got them.

10:44.161 --> 10:45.162
Yeah, in the front.

10:46.163 --> 10:46.997
Yeah, that's great.

10:47.030 --> 10:48.031
That's great.

10:49.566 --> 10:50.467
Okay, now go.

10:50.501 --> 10:52.002
Go get behind the wheel.

10:53.203 --> 10:54.104
Am I in your way?

10:56.173 --> 10:58.409
Okay, when I tell
you start the engine.

11:01.145 --> 11:02.045
Okay.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.550
Put it in drive.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.518
Now?

11:07.551 --> 11:08.552
Put it in drive.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.454
Alright, okay, alright.

11:11.488 --> 11:12.356
Fuck.

11:14.558 --> 11:15.459
Ready.

11:15.492 --> 11:17.060
And then when I say go...

11:17.094 --> 11:19.029
When you say go, I got it.

11:19.062 --> 11:20.030
I go, right?

11:20.063 --> 11:21.198
I'm gonna tell you,

11:21.231 --> 11:24.301
you just ease into
the gas pedal, okay?

11:26.003 --> 11:27.738
Almost there.

11:27.772 --> 11:29.039
Okay, that's good.

11:29.774 --> 11:33.076
Now just slowly easy.

11:33.110 --> 11:36.580
Keep going.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.549
Halt it.

11:41.318 --> 11:42.754
Okay.

11:42.787 --> 11:44.021
I just wanna get out of here.

11:44.054 --> 11:44.988
I just wanna go home.

11:45.022 --> 11:46.023
I wanna get home,

11:46.056 --> 11:46.523
I wanna get home.

11:46.557 --> 11:48.258
Make us be home.

11:50.194 --> 11:51.328
The other side is worse.

11:51.361 --> 11:52.262
Okay, ready.

11:55.098 --> 11:55.966
Dad.

11:57.034 --> 11:58.435
Easy on the gas.

12:10.514 --> 12:11.381
Mom!

12:12.382 --> 12:13.283
What?

12:13.317 --> 12:14.251
Grandpa's hurt.

12:14.284 --> 12:15.152
Shit.

12:16.386 --> 12:17.521
How bad?

12:17.554 --> 12:19.056
Mom, help him.

12:19.089 --> 12:20.524
Oh dad, I'm so
sorry, I'm so sorry.

12:20.557 --> 12:21.558
It's not your fault.

12:21.592 --> 12:23.627
Emily, go get
the first aid kit.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.128
Oh geez.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.263
Oh, don't look at
it, don't look at it.

12:26.296 --> 12:27.431
Just keep pressure on it.

12:27.464 --> 12:28.499
Hurry up, Emily.

12:31.836 --> 12:33.570
There's nothing here.

12:33.604 --> 12:37.040
Well then just grab a
towel or T-shirt, anything.

12:40.143 --> 12:42.513
Oh my God, here.

12:42.546 --> 12:44.281
Emily, help me get him up.

12:44.314 --> 12:45.549
We're gonna help you up dad.

12:49.553 --> 12:51.321
Okay, dad, we're
gonna sit you down.

12:52.556 --> 12:54.558
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.

12:55.492 --> 12:56.360
You can handle this.

12:56.393 --> 12:57.528
No, I can't.

13:01.231 --> 13:02.099
Oh God.

13:05.636 --> 13:07.504
I don't know what to do.

13:07.538 --> 13:09.072
What about the guy?

13:09.106 --> 13:11.041
Maybe he has a phone
out here that works.

13:12.175 --> 13:15.245
Okay, we'll wait
until he comes back.

13:15.279 --> 13:16.513
If you're not gonna
do anything about it,

13:16.547 --> 13:17.548
then I'm gonna go.

13:17.581 --> 13:18.248
You're not going
anywhere, Emily I'm mean it.

13:18.282 --> 13:20.651
Can you two stop bickering?

13:22.386 --> 13:24.321
Emily, hand me some water.

13:24.354 --> 13:25.222
Here.

13:26.423 --> 13:28.091
Take a sip.

13:28.125 --> 13:28.625
There you go.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.597
How are you feeling?

13:33.630 --> 13:35.165
I've had better days.

13:35.198 --> 13:36.700
Emily, you are not going.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.435
Why?

13:38.468 --> 13:41.371
Because you're
not, that's why.

13:41.405 --> 13:42.606
We need to be here for him.

13:44.174 --> 13:45.142
Give me your phone.

13:47.210 --> 13:48.612
When was the last
time you had a signal?

13:48.645 --> 13:49.179
I don't know.

13:49.212 --> 13:50.213
Give me your phone.

13:54.484 --> 13:56.186
What are you doing?

13:56.219 --> 14:01.091
I am going to go up here
and see what I can see.

14:02.559 --> 14:03.427
Okay.

14:13.236 --> 14:14.438
Shit.

14:14.471 --> 14:15.439
What do you see mom?

14:15.472 --> 14:18.609
Three people stranded in
a stupid forest, maybe?

14:30.520 --> 14:31.521
That's your idea?

14:31.555 --> 14:33.724
This will get his attention.

14:33.758 --> 14:35.492
We're gonna die.

14:35.525 --> 14:36.593
Why can't you just
take control...

14:38.528 --> 14:40.163
Mom, this is really
the dumbest thing...

14:41.966 --> 14:43.533
Did you find this in
the survival guide,

14:43.567 --> 14:44.735
because this is not surviving.

14:44.769 --> 14:46.503
I can't hear you.

14:46.536 --> 14:47.571
What is this gonna do?

14:48.472 --> 14:50.374
Who are you trying
to let hear this?

15:05.823 --> 15:08.392
I guess we're camping now, huh?

15:08.425 --> 15:09.292
Yep.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.397
I mean, if that landowner
was anywhere nearby,

15:13.430 --> 15:14.531
he would've heard the horn.

15:16.233 --> 15:18.635
I don't think he would
hear a horn from a mile away.

15:21.605 --> 15:23.540
I'm gonna go fix
us some dinner.

15:25.542 --> 15:26.710
I'm not really hungry.

15:27.678 --> 15:28.545
Okay.

15:35.787 --> 15:37.587
I'll go look for
him in the morning.

15:40.557 --> 15:43.360
You know, I
think you should do

15:43.393 --> 15:45.462
what your mother thinks is best.

15:47.564 --> 15:48.598
She's scared.

15:48.632 --> 15:49.767
She can't handle this.

15:51.735 --> 15:53.771
You know, she's a lot
tougher than you think.

15:56.606 --> 15:58.208
I don't know about that.

16:04.048 --> 16:05.649
You'd be surprised.

16:05.682 --> 16:06.683
Here, sweetie.

16:15.525 --> 16:16.493
Tomorrow morning,

16:17.829 --> 16:20.731
you two should start walking
back to the main road.

16:21.766 --> 16:24.434
It's about seven, eight miles.

16:26.570 --> 16:28.338
Why don't we get
a good night's sleep

16:28.371 --> 16:30.307
and we'll figure it
out in the morning.

16:32.877 --> 16:34.244
Sounds good to me.

16:48.692 --> 16:50.762
What are you doing?

16:50.795 --> 16:53.630
Well, maybe that
man will see the smoke

16:53.663 --> 16:54.832
and come back.

16:57.667 --> 16:58.770
How'd you sleep?

16:58.803 --> 16:59.669
What sleep?

17:00.570 --> 17:01.906
It was freezing.

17:01.939 --> 17:02.807
I know.

17:05.742 --> 17:06.844
What are we gonna do?

17:08.578 --> 17:11.381
I'm not sure, but we
can't leave him alone.

17:13.683 --> 17:16.553
Well, I think one of us
should go look for help.

17:16.586 --> 17:19.556
What we should do is wait
and see if he comes back

17:19.589 --> 17:21.525
or try and fix the RV.

17:23.660 --> 17:24.929
Let's just wait a
little while longer.

17:24.962 --> 17:26.630
I don't think so, mom.

17:27.799 --> 17:29.801
You disagree with
everything I say so.

17:29.834 --> 17:30.835
No I don't.

17:32.837 --> 17:33.938
You just did it.

17:33.971 --> 17:34.872
What are you afraid of?

17:34.906 --> 17:36.540
We already tried all of that.

17:36.573 --> 17:38.408
I just don't think
we should separate.

17:38.441 --> 17:40.510
It could make things worse.

17:40.544 --> 17:41.779
That wound is serious.

17:41.813 --> 17:44.782
Do you think I
don't know that?

17:44.816 --> 17:47.317
I just think doing
nothing is not a plan.

17:48.052 --> 17:50.487
Okay, things just
don't fix themselves.

17:52.656 --> 17:55.458
We're never gonna get out
of here with you in charge.

18:10.908 --> 18:12.576
Oh my God.

18:12.609 --> 18:13.443
Daddy, breathe.

18:13.476 --> 18:14.444
Just breathe.

18:14.477 --> 18:14.979
Dad, breathe.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.546
Emily, get my bag.

18:16.580 --> 18:17.414
Get my bag.

18:17.447 --> 18:18.615
It's in the back.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.618
Daddy, breathe.

18:22.586 --> 18:23.788
Quick, quick, quick.

18:23.821 --> 18:25.957
Give me some water.

18:25.990 --> 18:27.758
Here daddy, take these.

18:27.792 --> 18:28.658
Take these.

18:29.593 --> 18:30.427
Hurry up, hurry up.

18:30.460 --> 18:31.595
Water.

18:31.628 --> 18:32.462
Here, here.

18:32.495 --> 18:33.496
Okay.

18:46.944 --> 18:48.545
You're okay.

18:48.578 --> 18:49.579
You're okay.

18:57.687 --> 18:58.622
Hey dad.

18:59.556 --> 19:00.892
How do you feel?

19:00.925 --> 19:02.659
Oh, I'm really tired.

19:08.531 --> 19:09.699
Where are you going?

19:09.733 --> 19:11.501
Emily's gonna stay here with you

19:11.534 --> 19:14.471
and I am gonna go walk
up the road a mile

19:14.504 --> 19:15.840
and see if I can
find that landowner.

19:15.873 --> 19:17.842
And you better
be really careful.

19:17.875 --> 19:19.043
I will.

19:19.076 --> 19:20.778
You rest, and I will
be back very soon.

19:25.749 --> 19:26.583
Have everything?

19:26.616 --> 19:27.484
Yeah.

19:29.053 --> 19:30.955
Do you think this
is the best idea?

19:30.988 --> 19:31.923
Do you want me to go?

19:31.956 --> 19:33.523
No, I do not want you to go.

19:33.556 --> 19:35.525
I want you to stay here
and take care of grandpa.

19:35.558 --> 19:36.660
Do not leave.

19:36.693 --> 19:37.560
Okay.

19:39.830 --> 19:42.532
What do you do if
you run out of water?

19:42.565 --> 19:43.566
What?

19:44.969 --> 19:46.003
You know.

19:46.037 --> 19:47.537
No.

19:47.570 --> 19:48.538
You drink your urine.

19:48.571 --> 19:49.539
Oh, God.

19:49.572 --> 19:50.808
I will not be doing that.

19:50.841 --> 19:51.675
Mom.

19:51.708 --> 19:52.609
I would rather die.

19:52.642 --> 19:54.544
If you die, we all die.

19:54.577 --> 19:56.513
Enough with the
millennial bullshit.

19:56.546 --> 19:59.449
Just stay here and
keep an eye on grandpa.

20:00.985 --> 20:02.954
I'm not a millennial.

21:48.092 --> 21:50.895
Hello?

21:50.928 --> 21:52.695
Hello, I need help.

22:30.768 --> 22:31.769
Hello.

22:31.802 --> 22:32.669
Is anybody home?

22:34.071 --> 22:34.939
Hello?

22:40.743 --> 22:41.711
Hello?

22:41.744 --> 22:42.679
There's been an accident.

22:42.712 --> 22:43.881
I need to use your phone.

22:54.825 --> 22:55.692
Hello?

23:13.477 --> 23:14.845
Is someone there?

23:26.924 --> 23:27.791
Hello?

23:47.811 --> 23:48.812
Who's there?

23:56.820 --> 23:57.855
Where are you?

23:58.822 --> 24:00.958
I'm looking for a working phone.

24:46.870 --> 24:48.205
Is someone there?

25:08.125 --> 25:09.326
Please help me.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.928
Where's my sister?

25:10.961 --> 25:12.029
Where's my sister?

25:13.297 --> 25:14.331
Where's my sister?

25:14.365 --> 25:16.133
Where's my sister?

26:40.084 --> 26:41.452
After you eat lunch,

26:42.486 --> 26:43.987
we'll get you some sun.

27:05.175 --> 27:06.410
I have a secret.

27:08.946 --> 27:10.381
I saw somebody today.

27:10.414 --> 27:11.915
Where'd you see them?

27:13.450 --> 27:15.152
It was a woman.

27:16.353 --> 27:18.389
She was outside the house.

27:18.422 --> 27:19.990
She knocked on the door.

27:22.993 --> 27:23.894
But then she left.

27:28.198 --> 27:29.166
Take your pills.

27:51.588 --> 27:54.024
Oh, hell, start with that.

29:40.497 --> 29:42.533
She was in this house.

29:44.234 --> 29:46.069
I better not find you in here.

29:47.604 --> 29:49.239
Are you in here?

29:51.308 --> 29:53.110
Did she see you?

29:57.447 --> 30:00.117
Did she come up the stairs?

30:02.152 --> 30:03.353
Answer me, Andrew.

30:04.288 --> 30:05.155
Did she see you?

30:07.257 --> 30:08.091
Answer me, Andrew.

30:08.125 --> 30:09.159
Did she see you?

30:29.446 --> 30:31.081
Someone's been in the house.

30:31.916 --> 30:32.583
Sure?

30:32.616 --> 30:34.184
Yes.

30:34.217 --> 30:35.552
Get here when you can.

30:35.586 --> 30:36.553
Did they see him?

30:36.587 --> 30:38.088
I'm not sure.

31:01.211 --> 31:02.479
Please help me.

31:02.512 --> 31:04.348
How long have
you been in here?

31:04.381 --> 31:05.449
Since I was a boy.

31:06.717 --> 31:08.385
Is there a working
phone in this house?

31:08.418 --> 31:09.686
Yes, but he hides it.

31:10.621 --> 31:12.289
Why are you here?

31:12.322 --> 31:14.658
We were camping by the river
and there was an accident.

31:14.691 --> 31:16.727
My father needs to
get to a hospital.

31:17.962 --> 31:20.364
I'm sorry, I have gotta go.

31:20.397 --> 31:21.766
He's leaving.

31:21.799 --> 31:24.234
Please, please, please,
you gotta help me.

31:24.267 --> 31:25.636
You have to help my sister.

31:25.669 --> 31:27.337
Her name's Natalie, please.

31:29.640 --> 31:30.707
Where's your sister?

31:31.809 --> 31:33.310
She's in the basement.

31:34.711 --> 31:35.679
I can hear her.

31:37.982 --> 31:39.449
I'm sorry, I have to go.

31:39.483 --> 31:40.684
I'm gonna bring help.

31:41.685 --> 31:42.653
Please help my sister.

32:40.778 --> 32:45.783
Hello?

32:47.517 --> 32:48.485
Hello, Natalie.

32:50.855 --> 32:51.688
No way.

33:04.334 --> 33:05.736
Grandpa, somebody is coming.

33:12.642 --> 33:13.610
I asked you to
leave my property.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.412
Why are you still here?

33:15.445 --> 33:17.614
Our RV got stuck, sir.

33:17.647 --> 33:19.316
My grandpa's really hurt.

33:19.851 --> 33:20.852
My mom went to look for you,

33:20.885 --> 33:21.853
you didn't see her?

33:21.886 --> 33:22.719
Where's your grandpa?

33:22.754 --> 33:23.755
What happened?

33:23.788 --> 33:24.756
He's inside.

33:24.789 --> 33:26.423
He's lost a lot of blood.

33:27.759 --> 33:30.660
Do you have a phone
that works out here?

33:30.694 --> 33:31.763
No I don't.

33:31.796 --> 33:33.497
How long has your mom been gone?

33:35.867 --> 33:38.635
Seems your problem
is now my problem.

33:38.668 --> 33:39.703
What do you mean?

33:39.736 --> 33:40.838
It's in there, all right.

33:42.840 --> 33:44.441
What's your mom's name?

33:44.474 --> 33:45.342
Helen.

33:46.409 --> 33:47.544
Helen, what?

33:48.913 --> 33:50.747
Helen Schaffer.

33:50.782 --> 33:51.581
You think she's
the kind of person

33:51.615 --> 33:53.350
that would walk
into someone's house

33:53.383 --> 33:54.551
without their permission.

33:56.553 --> 33:57.721
She's not like that.

33:57.755 --> 34:00.724
I hope not.

34:00.758 --> 34:02.325
Mom, what are you doing?

34:02.359 --> 34:05.428
He's got somebody locked
up in his house, Emily.

34:05.462 --> 34:07.464
Get me something
to tie him up with.

34:07.497 --> 34:08.331
Oh my God.

34:08.365 --> 34:09.666
Hurry, go.

34:09.699 --> 34:10.534
Tie him up?

34:10.567 --> 34:11.635
Tie him up with what?

34:11.668 --> 34:14.504
I don't know the rope
from the tents that we use.

34:14.538 --> 34:15.572
Go hurry, hurry.

34:17.809 --> 34:19.811
This is the last
time I go camping.

34:20.778 --> 34:21.678
Hurry up, Emily.

34:21.711 --> 34:23.848
Mom, you're gonna kill him.

34:23.881 --> 34:24.714
Give me.

34:24.748 --> 34:26.616
Tie up his feet.

34:27.517 --> 34:28.718
Tie up his feet.

34:43.167 --> 34:43.935
Emily.

34:43.968 --> 34:44.936
Holy shit.

34:44.969 --> 34:45.870
Sit here.

34:45.903 --> 34:46.838
Mom, what are you doing?

34:46.871 --> 34:47.839
Sit here and take this.

34:48.873 --> 34:49.841
Come on.

34:49.874 --> 34:51.541
Is it loaded?

34:51.575 --> 34:52.442
Sit.

34:53.410 --> 34:54.812
Hold this on him.

34:54.846 --> 34:57.447
If he tries to move from
that spot, shoot him.

34:57.480 --> 35:01.853
I mean warn him first
and then shoot his legs.

35:01.886 --> 35:02.987
Okay?

35:03.020 --> 35:04.588
Do you understand?

35:04.621 --> 35:05.455
You can do this.

35:05.488 --> 35:05.957
Do you understand?

35:05.990 --> 35:07.490
Okay.

35:07.524 --> 35:09.593
What the hell is
going on out there?

35:10.761 --> 35:11.695
You two still arguing?

35:11.728 --> 35:12.897
We have to get out of here.

35:12.930 --> 35:13.865
There's an ATV and
I've got the keys,

35:13.898 --> 35:14.799
but I need you to get up.

35:14.832 --> 35:15.732
You have to get up now.

35:15.766 --> 35:16.868
Get up and come with me.

35:16.901 --> 35:18.735
Dad, work with me
you're too heavy.

35:18.769 --> 35:20.737
Got to help me here.

35:20.771 --> 35:22.006
Dad, up.

35:22.039 --> 35:22.874
I can't.

35:22.907 --> 35:23.875
This is not gonna work.

35:23.908 --> 35:24.775
Not gonna work.

35:26.476 --> 35:27.510
Jesus.

35:33.784 --> 35:34.684
I love you, Helen.

35:38.655 --> 35:39.656
I love you too, dad.

35:40.657 --> 35:41.524
Hurry back.

35:42.326 --> 35:46.396
Remember we still have
to make those smores.

35:51.701 --> 35:53.637
Here, let me take this.

35:53.670 --> 35:54.772
I saw a truck back at the house,

35:54.805 --> 35:56.539
we need to find the keys.

35:56.573 --> 35:57.574
Check his pockets.

35:58.809 --> 36:00.510
I'm not checking his pocket.

36:00.543 --> 36:02.013
Please, I just walked a thousand
miles through the woods.

36:02.046 --> 36:03.881
Would you just
check his pockets?

36:03.915 --> 36:06.583
Come on, the longer you
take the longer we're here.

36:08.618 --> 36:10.054
Hurry up.

36:10.087 --> 36:11.588
Which pocket?

36:11.621 --> 36:12.489
All of them?

36:13.958 --> 36:14.825
Oh, God.

36:19.696 --> 36:21.598
Oh, for Christ's
sake take this.

36:35.112 --> 36:38.515
Oh, God who keeps her
keys in the back pocket?

36:38.548 --> 36:39.549
Go

36:39.582 --> 36:40.450
Okay.

36:41.584 --> 36:43.586
Hurry, mom.

37:09.780 --> 37:10.881
No, no, no.

37:12.883 --> 37:14.584
Stupid ass truck.

37:55.692 --> 37:57.762
What are you doing?

37:57.795 --> 37:59.764
My mom will be back
soon with the police.

37:59.797 --> 38:01.631
Did she go back to the house?

38:01.664 --> 38:02.565
Did she?

38:02.599 --> 38:03.600
Maybe.

38:03.633 --> 38:05.936
If she did she's in danger.

38:05.970 --> 38:07.737
She shouldn't be there.

38:07.772 --> 38:08.839
What kind of danger?

38:10.074 --> 38:11.741
Stop moving.

38:12.777 --> 38:14.879
I've done nothing to hurt you?

38:14.912 --> 38:15.880
He's dangerous.

38:16.981 --> 38:18.581
You don't know
what you're doing.

38:18.615 --> 38:21.751
I don't care
what you say, sir.

38:23.087 --> 38:25.823
You move again,
and I'll shoot you.

38:44.108 --> 38:45.109
Oh my God.

38:46.243 --> 38:48.112
Did you find my sister?

38:48.145 --> 38:50.147
No, I didn't find her yet.

38:52.116 --> 38:53.184
Does he keep a gas can

38:53.217 --> 38:54.852
in the house somewhere?

38:54.885 --> 38:56.586
The truck is on empty.

38:57.788 --> 38:58.721
In the basement.

39:00.657 --> 39:01.892
I was afraid you'd say that.

39:04.795 --> 39:05.728
Let me see this thing.

39:07.765 --> 39:08.799
This is welded.

39:11.701 --> 39:14.671
Listen, I'm gonna
go get a knife.

39:14.704 --> 39:15.873
I'm gonna cut you
out of this thing.

39:15.906 --> 39:18.608
I promise I'll be right back.

39:46.703 --> 39:47.838
Hello?

39:47.872 --> 39:49.206
I'm here to help.

41:02.846 --> 41:03.713
Oh my God.

41:26.904 --> 41:27.871
I got it.

41:29.073 --> 41:30.774
Where's my sister?

41:30.808 --> 41:31.375
I didn't see her down there.

41:31.408 --> 41:32.943
I'm so sorry.

41:32.977 --> 41:37.314
No, no, you're a liar.

41:37.348 --> 41:38.916
I'm not lying,
she wasn't there.

41:38.949 --> 41:39.984
You're a liar.

41:40.017 --> 41:40.985
I'm not lying.

41:41.018 --> 41:41.885
You're a liar.

41:41.919 --> 41:42.553
Andrew.

41:42.586 --> 41:45.856
Get the

42:02.106 --> 42:03.274
Andrew, come back.

42:03.307 --> 42:05.876
Come back, it's
not safe out there.

42:05.909 --> 42:07.144
Andrew.

42:24.061 --> 42:25.896
Came into my house.

42:33.037 --> 42:34.838
Came into my house.

42:40.077 --> 42:41.312
Now, he's gone.

42:49.353 --> 42:51.322
They came into my house.

42:55.392 --> 42:56.994
What the hell are
you doing here, lady?

42:57.027 --> 42:58.062
Who are you?

42:59.163 --> 43:01.165
You know, he's gone
because of you.

43:01.198 --> 43:03.267
He's gone because of you.

43:35.499 --> 43:36.367
Who are you?

43:37.434 --> 43:38.435
I'm his mother.

43:39.403 --> 43:41.138
What are you doing here?

43:41.171 --> 43:42.673
I just came for help.

43:42.706 --> 43:44.041
I'm camping nearby

43:44.074 --> 43:45.476
and there was an accident.

43:47.010 --> 43:49.913
Oh, but you had to
break into my house?

43:49.947 --> 43:50.681
I didn't break in.

43:50.714 --> 43:52.116
I swear the door was open.

43:52.149 --> 43:53.384
So you just walked right in?

43:53.417 --> 43:54.418
Who else is with you?

43:56.153 --> 43:57.221
It's just me and my father

43:57.254 --> 43:58.222
and he needs an ambulance.

43:58.255 --> 43:59.089
Please, that's all,

43:59.123 --> 44:00.157
we just need some help.

44:02.559 --> 44:05.496
Well, we'll get to that.

44:05.529 --> 44:08.132
No, you don't understand,

44:08.165 --> 44:09.933
he's gonna die if
he doesn't get help.

44:09.967 --> 44:11.402
Please just let me go.

44:11.435 --> 44:13.170
Let me go.

44:13.203 --> 44:15.072
Oh, calm yourself.

44:17.174 --> 44:21.111
You know, I really
would like to trust you.

44:21.145 --> 44:22.279
I really would.

44:22.312 --> 44:23.547
It would make things
so much easier,

44:23.580 --> 44:26.283
but you've seen Andrew.

44:26.316 --> 44:28.085
What did he say to you?

44:28.118 --> 44:29.219
Why does that matter?

44:32.122 --> 44:33.924
It matters to you.

44:39.096 --> 44:40.330
He wants to see his sister.

44:41.565 --> 44:44.435
His sister died years ago.

44:44.468 --> 44:48.272
My only son is out
there because of you.

44:48.305 --> 44:50.140
He's my only son.

44:50.174 --> 44:52.543
I don't know what I will
do if he doesn't come back.

44:54.144 --> 44:55.045
And I blame you.

44:55.078 --> 44:56.079
I blame you.

44:59.784 --> 45:01.485
May I have some water, please?

45:05.355 --> 45:06.990
Okay, I'm gonna need
you to move over here

45:07.024 --> 45:08.992
so I can see you
when I go get it.

45:09.026 --> 45:11.763
I can't.

45:11.796 --> 45:15.299
Untie me, I can help
you get out of here.

45:17.802 --> 45:19.369
I'm not as naive as I look.

45:22.105 --> 45:24.575
Please, let me
have some water.

45:32.516 --> 45:34.251
Don't kick me.

45:35.385 --> 45:37.120
I'll let you bake out here.

46:02.479 --> 46:04.081
What are you doing?

46:04.114 --> 46:05.282
Hey, grandpa.

46:06.316 --> 46:07.451
Water?

46:07.484 --> 46:08.352
Mmmh.

46:18.695 --> 46:19.563
Thanks.

46:21.265 --> 46:22.666
Where's your mom?

46:22.699 --> 46:24.034
She'll be back.

46:26.603 --> 46:28.305
I want you to trust her.

46:29.874 --> 46:30.574
Okay.

46:32.409 --> 46:33.610
Andrew, stop.

46:35.112 --> 46:36.146
Who are you?

46:36.179 --> 46:36.680
Don't shoot, he's my nephew.

46:36.713 --> 46:37.548
He's sick.

46:37.581 --> 46:39.316
No, you poison me.

46:42.252 --> 46:44.421
Don't just stand
there, help me.

46:44.454 --> 46:45.322
Help me.

46:52.563 --> 46:55.365
Don't just stand there, help me.

47:42.613 --> 47:43.647
Go away.

47:44.247 --> 47:46.550
I just
need to talk to you.

48:00.497 --> 48:02.366
What do you want from us?

48:02.399 --> 48:03.266
I'm hungry.

48:04.267 --> 48:06.403
There's nothing here for you.

48:06.436 --> 48:09.272
It's really cold
out here, please.

48:10.407 --> 48:11.708
I'm not opening the door.

48:12.609 --> 48:14.144
So just leave, okay?

48:16.680 --> 48:17.547
Go.

49:11.401 --> 49:12.269
Shit.

50:00.550 --> 50:02.619
I didn't mean to scare you.

50:02.652 --> 50:03.755
Just go away.

50:57.842 --> 50:58.910
I know where she is.

50:59.944 --> 51:01.311
Your mother, I mean.

51:02.847 --> 51:05.482
She's at my house
with my sister.

51:06.716 --> 51:08.518
I'm sorry that I
broke your window.

51:11.889 --> 51:12.857
I didn't mean to scare you.

51:12.890 --> 51:14.658
You killed somebody.

51:16.459 --> 51:17.327
I had to.

51:21.999 --> 51:22.934
They poison me.

51:24.601 --> 51:25.803
I wouldn't hurt you.

51:25.837 --> 51:26.736
Can you please come out?

51:26.771 --> 51:28.605
Yeah, I don't think so.

51:30.507 --> 51:31.675
It's getting cold in here.

51:31.708 --> 51:33.710
Maybe you shouldn't have
thrown a rock through the window

51:33.743 --> 51:34.912
you fucking idiot.

51:39.716 --> 51:40.517
I'm tired.

51:43.620 --> 51:44.621
I wanna go to sleep.

51:52.629 --> 51:54.866
I liked it better here
with the lights on.

51:54.899 --> 51:55.967
You're telling me.

52:02.773 --> 52:03.841
How are you feeling?

52:05.609 --> 52:06.443
You hungry?

52:06.476 --> 52:06.978
You want some food?

52:10.781 --> 52:13.985
Okay, well I'll just put
it over here for later.

52:17.889 --> 52:20.992
You know, I just feel awful

52:21.025 --> 52:22.960
about the way this
whole thing started.

52:24.661 --> 52:27.932
I mean, I can imagine
what you must be thinking,

52:27.965 --> 52:30.835
your father out there hurt and
we need to get him some help.

52:30.868 --> 52:32.435
Please, please.

52:32.469 --> 52:34.537
Well, tell me where
the campsite is.

52:35.538 --> 52:36.941
I can send my husband.

52:36.974 --> 52:40.211
I mean, the hospital
is 30 miles away.

52:40.244 --> 52:43.814
Why can't you
just call for help?

52:43.848 --> 52:46.951
Well, I could, but where
would they look for them?

52:46.984 --> 52:49.921
I mean, look, it's
pitch black outside.

52:49.954 --> 52:52.656
Nobody knows this land
better than we do.

52:52.689 --> 52:54.524
We'll find him first.

52:54.557 --> 52:56.794
How would I know
you wouldn't hurt him?

52:56.827 --> 52:58.595
If we would've heard anybody,

52:58.628 --> 52:59.729
we would've hurt you.

53:00.530 --> 53:04.068
You're the one who entered
this house illegally.

53:04.101 --> 53:05.803
You broke the law.

53:05.836 --> 53:07.004
No.

53:07.038 --> 53:10.007
You know people can get shot
for breaking and entering.

53:10.041 --> 53:11.508
But I didn't break...

53:11.541 --> 53:13.677
You have an
opportunity to here,

53:13.710 --> 53:15.846
right here, right
now to fix this.

53:16.646 --> 53:19.917
I don't know where my
brother is and I don't know

53:19.951 --> 53:20.952
where my son is.

53:22.853 --> 53:23.988
I need your help.

53:28.692 --> 53:29.961
Look, it seems to me

53:29.994 --> 53:33.030
you're running out of options.

53:33.064 --> 53:35.498
Where is the campsite?

53:40.871 --> 53:45.876
Okay, well, we'll find
it in the morning.

53:50.547 --> 53:55.485
But you better hope that when
we do find my son, he's okay.

53:56.586 --> 53:59.023
Or you will have
no options left.

54:00.091 --> 54:00.958
Got it?

54:10.935 --> 54:11.869
They're down by the river.

54:11.902 --> 54:13.737
Go see if you can find him.

54:13.771 --> 54:15.705
What are you gonna
do about the father?

54:16.673 --> 54:17.908
How the hell do I know?

54:19.143 --> 54:21.846
We're getting in
deeper and deeper here.

54:21.879 --> 54:23.948
Maybe we find Andrew
and we disappear...

54:23.981 --> 54:25.749
No, no.

54:25.783 --> 54:27.051
I'm not running anymore.

54:28.786 --> 54:30.755
What do you want
me to do then?

54:30.788 --> 54:32.757
Those people trespassed.

54:32.790 --> 54:35.059
Those people have
disrupted our lives.

54:36.593 --> 54:38.661
Are you willing to
let them separate us?

54:40.131 --> 54:41.766
Why don't you let her go?

54:43.968 --> 54:46.536
I don't need you
to be weak right now.

54:47.104 --> 54:48.738
Just go find him.

55:00.117 --> 55:00.985
They're here.

55:06.991 --> 55:07.992
Andrew.

55:08.025 --> 55:08.859
We have to hide.

55:08.893 --> 55:09.760
Listen to me.

55:11.028 --> 55:12.063
I just wanna go home.

55:12.096 --> 55:13.798
Stay quiet.

55:13.831 --> 55:17.034
If you don't and he finds
you, he'll poison you

55:17.068 --> 55:18.635
and lock you away forever.

55:18.668 --> 55:20.971
Your mother's
worried about you.

55:23.908 --> 55:24.975
We're not angry with you.

55:26.077 --> 55:27.644
Please.

55:27.677 --> 55:29.046
I'm
staying right here.

55:29.980 --> 55:31.882
I just wanna take you home.

55:32.850 --> 55:33.683
Andrew.

55:59.276 --> 56:02.079
Buddy, you're not
doing too good.

56:04.115 --> 56:07.017
Andrew, come on out.

56:08.986 --> 56:12.957
Let's not play any games here.

56:23.901 --> 56:26.137
I can hear you in there.

56:26.170 --> 56:27.037
Come on out.

56:30.107 --> 56:31.208
God damn it, Andrew.

56:32.276 --> 56:33.878
Unlock this door, now

56:43.187 --> 56:44.088
Who's in there?

56:46.056 --> 56:47.091
Come out.

56:48.192 --> 56:49.927
I won't hurt you.

56:49.960 --> 56:53.931
I'm looking for our
son that ran away.

56:55.166 --> 56:56.066
Have you seen him?

57:29.800 --> 57:33.137
You either lied to me or
something happened to Gary.

57:33.170 --> 57:34.805
He should have been back by now.

57:34.838 --> 57:37.508
Why would you leave your
son locked up in his room?

57:37.541 --> 57:39.810
We were taking care of...

57:39.843 --> 57:41.779
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

57:46.050 --> 57:47.284
Please just let me go.

57:47.818 --> 57:50.020
I'll leave and never come back.

57:50.054 --> 57:51.956
You'll never see me again.

57:51.989 --> 57:53.958
I swear, I won't tell
anyone I was here.

57:53.991 --> 57:56.093
You'll run and tell
everyone about this place

57:56.126 --> 57:58.128
and they will take
him away from me.

57:59.363 --> 58:00.931
They won't understand.

58:02.933 --> 58:03.834
I understand.

58:03.867 --> 58:05.836
Oh, you don't.

58:05.869 --> 58:07.871
I will never give
up on my family.

58:09.873 --> 58:10.708
Not ever.

58:31.829 --> 58:33.264
The man on the couch,

58:33.297 --> 58:34.865
I think he stopped breathing.

58:38.902 --> 58:39.870
You're lying.

58:42.239 --> 58:43.274
It's not true.

58:44.375 --> 58:45.776
He needs your help.

58:48.045 --> 58:49.046
You have to come out.

58:51.849 --> 58:52.983
Did you hurt him?

58:54.852 --> 58:56.353
How do I know you
didn't kill him?

58:57.921 --> 58:59.323
He doesn't have
much time left.

59:02.259 --> 59:03.827
Get away from the door.

59:08.332 --> 59:10.234
Get away from the door.

59:10.267 --> 59:11.201
Stay back.

59:16.040 --> 59:17.274
Grandpa.

59:17.308 --> 59:18.175
Grandpa.

59:22.212 --> 59:24.281
He's still breathing.

59:24.315 --> 59:25.182
Thank God.

59:26.216 --> 59:27.951
Why did you say that?

59:27.985 --> 59:29.920
I didn't think
he was breathing.

59:31.355 --> 59:34.625
But my sister she's at the
house and I need to help her.

59:34.658 --> 59:36.126
We have to leave right now.

59:38.195 --> 59:39.830
You're wearing his shoes.

59:41.165 --> 59:42.266
Who was that last night,

59:42.299 --> 59:44.201
and what did you do to him?

59:44.234 --> 59:45.169
Stay back.

59:46.970 --> 59:47.905
I was protecting you.

59:49.106 --> 59:50.374
He's outside on the ground.

59:53.344 --> 59:55.346
You killed him.

59:55.379 --> 59:56.246
Oh my God.

59:58.248 --> 1:00:00.084
You didn't hurt my mom, did you?

1:00:00.117 --> 1:00:03.320
No, but she needs
your help too.

1:00:03.354 --> 1:00:04.455
She's at the house.

1:00:05.189 --> 1:00:09.326
Look, I'm not used to
this kind of shit, okay.

1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:10.861
Why did you kill those men?

1:00:12.396 --> 1:00:17.167
Every day I wake up
and I sit on my bed.

1:00:17.201 --> 1:00:18.902
I eat, I read

1:00:19.903 --> 1:00:24.241
sometimes I get to go
outside, but that's it.

1:00:25.509 --> 1:00:26.877
So, you're like a prisoner.

1:00:27.745 --> 1:00:29.880
And he took me
away a long time ago.

1:00:30.714 --> 1:00:32.383
I just wanna protect my sister.

1:00:33.283 --> 1:00:34.985
Are you gonna help me?

1:00:35.018 --> 1:00:36.487
I don't know.

1:00:36.520 --> 1:00:38.088
Just keep your distance.

1:00:43.293 --> 1:00:47.197
This will go in your neck
if you try to hurt me.

1:04:15.773 --> 1:04:18.475
So what did these people
do to you, Andrew?

1:04:19.710 --> 1:04:21.678
I mean, if you don't
mind telling me.

1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:24.615
I don't think we
should talk about it.

1:04:25.783 --> 1:04:27.451
But they kidnapped you, right?

1:04:30.253 --> 1:04:31.388
How old is your sister?

1:04:33.190 --> 1:04:34.358
She's younger than me.

1:04:35.626 --> 1:04:38.228
I haven't seen her
since we were kids.

1:04:38.261 --> 1:04:39.764
Wait, you live
in the same house,

1:04:39.797 --> 1:04:42.633
but you haven't
seen her in years.

1:04:42.666 --> 1:04:44.501
How do you know if
she's even there?

1:04:44.534 --> 1:04:45.636
I hear her.

1:04:45.669 --> 1:04:48.672
She yells mostly at night.

1:04:48.705 --> 1:04:51.608
Maybe it's just
in your imagination.

1:04:51.642 --> 1:04:52.743
Have you ever
thought about that?

1:04:52.777 --> 1:04:54.277
What do you mean?

1:04:54.912 --> 1:04:57.214
I mean, maybe all the
yelling is in your head.

1:04:57.247 --> 1:04:59.716
You killed two
people back there.

1:04:59.750 --> 1:05:00.584
Don't stop.

1:05:00.617 --> 1:05:02.219
Keep going.

1:05:02.252 --> 1:05:02.753
Why?

1:05:04.287 --> 1:05:05.288
Because I need you to.

1:06:40.517 --> 1:06:41.384
Andrew?

1:07:08.846 --> 1:07:11.648
Sir, can you hear me?

1:07:12.817 --> 1:07:14.684
Your daughter sent
me to help you.

1:07:16.954 --> 1:07:19.589
Emily.

1:07:19.623 --> 1:07:20.490
Emily.

1:07:21.424 --> 1:07:22.760
My granddaughter.

1:07:22.794 --> 1:07:23.928
Your granddaughter she's here.

1:07:23.961 --> 1:07:24.896
She came with you.

1:07:28.665 --> 1:07:30.300
I'll make sure we find her.

1:07:40.945 --> 1:07:42.412
Anyone else here?

1:07:53.825 --> 1:07:54.826
You comfortable.

1:08:01.799 --> 1:08:05.335
That's it, just go to sleep.

1:08:06.403 --> 1:08:07.637
That's it.

1:08:07.671 --> 1:08:08.538
Let go.

1:08:10.407 --> 1:08:11.608
It will all be over soon.

1:08:15.445 --> 1:08:16.613
You just got in the way.

1:08:17.815 --> 1:08:18.748
That's all.

1:08:19.749 --> 1:08:20.852
Look at me

1:08:20.885 --> 1:08:22.385
I want you to see me.

1:08:23.955 --> 1:08:27.158
My husband is out there
lying in the dirt.

1:08:27.191 --> 1:08:29.392
It was your daughter
who did this.

1:08:31.963 --> 1:08:33.630
I am gonna take care of her too.

1:09:08.498 --> 1:09:10.533
Emily, are you here?

1:09:13.237 --> 1:09:14.471
Dad?

1:09:15.672 --> 1:09:16.539
Dad?

1:09:17.607 --> 1:09:18.475
Dad?

1:09:20.543 --> 1:09:23.480
Dad no

1:09:52.109 --> 1:09:53.576
There you are.

1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:05.823
I am coming for you, you bitch.

1:10:34.785 --> 1:10:36.619
I am gonna get you!

1:11:09.719 --> 1:11:11.588
We have to be quiet.

1:11:11.621 --> 1:11:13.090
She doesn't like a lot of noise.

1:11:31.641 --> 1:11:34.544
Your mother, she's
up those stairs.

1:11:38.382 --> 1:11:40.550
I'm not going up
there by myself.

1:11:53.630 --> 1:11:54.098
Mom?

1:11:59.636 --> 1:12:00.703
Hello?!

1:12:02.639 --> 1:12:03.673
Mom?

1:12:06.877 --> 1:12:07.744
Mom!

1:12:14.785 --> 1:12:19.790
Where is she?

1:12:26.797 --> 1:12:28.899
I think she is down there.

1:12:28.933 --> 1:12:31.668
If you think I'm gonna go
down there, you're crazy.

1:12:33.703 --> 1:12:34.872
I can't help you anymore.

1:12:41.678 --> 1:12:42.179
Andrew.

1:12:50.020 --> 1:12:50.888
Natalie

1:12:51.922 --> 1:12:53.023
I know you are here.

1:12:54.125 --> 1:12:57.027
They told me you were gone.

1:12:57.061 --> 1:12:58.796
But you are here.

1:12:58.829 --> 1:13:00.030
Don't be afraid.

1:13:01.265 --> 1:13:03.033
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:13:05.202 --> 1:13:06.070
Andrew.

1:13:07.004 --> 1:13:08.705
I need you down here.

1:13:08.738 --> 1:13:09.739
Please.

1:13:09.773 --> 1:13:10.640
Help me.

1:13:12.977 --> 1:13:15.645
Help me please.

1:13:22.286 --> 1:13:23.154
Don't be afraid.

1:13:24.488 --> 1:13:25.655
She's my friend.

1:13:26.924 --> 1:13:28.691
She's gonna help you get out.

1:13:31.829 --> 1:13:33.264
Please come down here.

1:13:33.297 --> 1:13:34.731
Help me.

1:13:34.765 --> 1:13:36.100
I need your help.

1:13:40.237 --> 1:13:41.071
I can't.

1:13:41.105 --> 1:13:42.072
Don't be afraid.

1:13:45.342 --> 1:13:47.144
I'm going to go
look for my mom.

1:13:48.745 --> 1:13:50.281
You shouldn't be here.

1:14:20.044 --> 1:14:21.111
Emily!

1:14:25.216 --> 1:14:26.083
Emily.

1:14:26.984 --> 1:14:28.185
Emily I'm here.

1:14:28.886 --> 1:14:31.088
If you hurt my
daughter, I swear to God

1:14:31.121 --> 1:14:34.091
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1:14:34.124 --> 1:14:34.992
Emily!

1:14:36.260 --> 1:14:38.762
you fucking
bitch, you harm Emily,

1:14:38.796 --> 1:14:40.831
I'll fucking kill you.

1:14:42.399 --> 1:14:44.201
Emily!

1:14:44.235 --> 1:14:45.869
Emily, it's me

1:14:48.405 --> 1:14:50.740
What did they do to you?

1:14:54.011 --> 1:14:55.813
Let me get you out.

1:14:57.381 --> 1:14:58.748
You're safe now

1:15:00.417 --> 1:15:01.285
Andrew

1:15:03.420 --> 1:15:05.389
Who are you talking to?

1:15:05.422 --> 1:15:07.925
Emily, we found her.

1:15:21.939 --> 1:15:23.007
I'm coming.

1:15:24.441 --> 1:15:25.309
Emily.

1:15:26.944 --> 1:15:28.379
Emily I'm here.

1:15:31.615 --> 1:15:34.051
Andrew, Andrew let her go.

1:15:37.021 --> 1:15:37.855
Oh honey, honey

1:15:37.888 --> 1:15:38.789
Emily, are you okay?

1:15:40.424 --> 1:15:42.393
You're scary her

1:15:42.426 --> 1:15:43.360
What, who?

1:15:44.461 --> 1:15:45.329
My sister.

1:15:46.430 --> 1:15:47.298
Oh my God.

1:15:53.437 --> 1:15:55.205
Please, we can't
leave her here.

1:15:56.340 --> 1:15:58.409
Please help us.

1:16:01.178 --> 1:16:02.046
Natalie

1:16:04.915 --> 1:16:07.017
We'll come back
for her, I promise.

1:16:07.051 --> 1:16:07.885
Andrew we have to go.

1:16:07.918 --> 1:16:08.919
We have to go

1:16:08.952 --> 1:16:09.920
We can't leave her

1:16:09.953 --> 1:16:11.322
You don't understand
your mother is up there

1:16:11.355 --> 1:16:12.323
waiting for us, this
is our only chance.

1:16:12.356 --> 1:16:13.624
If you want Natalie to live,

1:16:13.657 --> 1:16:15.225
you have to come with us now,

1:16:15.259 --> 1:16:16.427
- We can't leave her.
- Come on.

1:16:16.460 --> 1:16:18.095
Go up the stairs and
hide by the campsite.

1:16:18.128 --> 1:16:19.330
Go, go, go

1:16:19.363 --> 1:16:20.364
Run Emily.

1:16:21.398 --> 1:16:22.266
Go!

1:16:25.369 --> 1:16:27.338
Run Emily run.

1:16:27.371 --> 1:16:29.206
Emily run.

1:16:32.343 --> 1:16:33.210
Oh God.

1:16:35.346 --> 1:16:37.448
Get out of here,
get out of here.

1:16:37.481 --> 1:16:39.149
Say goodbye to your mother.

1:16:55.432 --> 1:17:00.404
What makes you think you family
is more important than mine.

1:17:05.976 --> 1:17:07.010
Get off me.

1:17:12.416 --> 1:17:15.419
Hellen, what do you
do when you see a bear?

1:17:17.488 --> 1:17:18.922
You play dead.

1:17:29.566 --> 1:17:30.434
Mom, mom

1:17:33.404 --> 1:17:34.271
No.

1:17:37.741 --> 1:17:39.543
They would put
you in a hospital.

1:17:39.576 --> 1:17:41.011
I can't let that happen.

1:17:46.583 --> 1:17:49.119
I had no choice, you know that.

1:17:57.227 --> 1:17:59.396
We'll bury them
next to each other.

1:17:59.430 --> 1:18:01.098
That'd be the right thing to do.

1:18:15.145 --> 1:18:16.313
Please let me keep her

1:18:22.486 --> 1:18:24.354
You are all I
have in this world.

1:18:33.363 --> 1:18:37.534
Don't you tell me, I'll
never give up on my family.

1:19:01.592 --> 1:19:04.127
Emily, I'm gonna
get us out of here.

1:19:08.632 --> 1:19:10.300
Sweetie, I'm so
sorry this happened.

1:19:10.334 --> 1:19:11.568
It is okay, go.

1:19:16.340 --> 1:19:19.209
There is no gas,
there's no gas.

1:19:20.410 --> 1:19:21.612
Mom, mom go go.

1:19:49.640 --> 1:19:51.275
I am so sorry.

1:23:01.398 --> 1:23:08.906
Natalie, I came back, I promise
I won't hurt you again.
