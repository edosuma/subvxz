01:30.882 --> 01:34.009
Hello, there's a baby here.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.890
There must be a mother. Hello!

01:40.850 --> 01:42.142
There's a baby.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.826
Help!

02:04.165 --> 02:06.250
Hello? Is anybody here?

02:55.925 --> 03:00.179
Miscarriage-prone female reproductive
system is merely an extension

03:00.263 --> 03:05.392
of the body's natural and necessary
instincts to reject foreign matter.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.938
Just two drops. The body
mistakenly identifies the embryo

03:10.023 --> 03:12.024
as an unwanted foreign substance

03:12.108 --> 03:15.485
and creates antibodies
to fight and reject it.

03:15.904 --> 03:19.323
From this equation comes the
idea for the drug, Expectane

03:19.407 --> 03:22.284
which acts to neutralize
the interfering antibodies

03:22.368 --> 03:25.370
and promote successful
embryo attachment.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.291
Minnie here, had a
history of miscarriages.

03:29.375 --> 03:33.629
As a result of our treatments, she's
now in her seventh month of pregnancy.

03:34.589 --> 03:37.883
She takes 10 cc of
Expectane three times a day.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.444
Hey, Keith. Good morning.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.865
Ned.
- Larry. Hey, big day.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.660
Are you nervous?
- FDA? Piece of cake.

04:05.119 --> 04:07.621
Sign those plan documents, will you?
- All right.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.539
Hello, Louse. Hello, everybody.

04:09.624 --> 04:12.125
Mrs. Parrish is in for a
second trimester sonogram.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.003
You have an initial
consultation with the Lanzarottas

04:15.088 --> 04:19.341
and Mrs. Logan's here for a final.
- Okay. Bagel, please. Thank you.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.926
Hello.
- Doctor.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.137
I'm ready to explode.
- Not here, you're not.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.390
Perfect.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.518
Just one more month.
- Yes.

04:29.602 --> 04:33.355
Get me new blood and urine samples.
- Blood and urine samples.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.275
Dr. Hesse, good luck with the FDA.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.528
Luck is for the ill-prepared.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.947
Car's waiting out front.
- Thank you.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.533
I had them check the traffic reports.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.784
And the big dweeb?

04:45.868 --> 04:48.912
He and Mr. Banes will meet
you downtown. Good luck.

04:53.084 --> 04:57.254
In testing the drug on chimpanzees
with a history of miscarriages

04:57.338 --> 05:01.216
I found conclusively that in every
instance the side effects observed

05:01.301 --> 05:05.387
were consistent with the behavioral
and metabolic changes in subjects

05:05.471 --> 05:08.098
with normal, unmedicated pregnancies:

05:08.433 --> 05:12.269
Nausea, mood swings, appetite
fluctuation, irritability.

05:12.353 --> 05:15.731
Typical "lamb chop's got a
bun in the oven" type behavior.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.651
This drug works.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.162
Madam chairperson, ladies and gentlemen

05:30.246 --> 05:32.873
we respectfully request
the board's approval

05:32.957 --> 05:36.001
to carry on into an
invasive human protocol.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.210
Thank you.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.463
You got to let us try
this on real women.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.214
Women in need.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.841
Our sisters.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.593
Our daughters...
- Dr. Arbogast.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.888
If you could see the couples
that come into my office.

05:47.972 --> 05:51.475
Their pain and frustration is genuine.
- Dr. Arbogast.

05:52.685 --> 05:53.810
Madam?

05:55.021 --> 05:58.231
This is an FDA hearing, not a telethon.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.152
We have all the information we need.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.320
Thank you.

06:03.488 --> 06:07.699
As director of Leland University's
biotechnology research program

06:07.784 --> 06:11.953
I thank you on behalf of my esteemed
colleagues for your consideration.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.872
Let's go, gentlemen.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.542
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.299
That went pretty good.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.932
I'm sure you'll be
very comfortable here.

06:32.016 --> 06:35.936
We have all the latest
videocassettes, the current magazines.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.565
Give it to Louise when you're finished.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.151
I'm sure you'll be very comfortable.

06:43.236 --> 06:47.239
Just relax and enjoy
it. That's the ticket.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.786
Dr. Arbogast? Your wife, sorry, your
ex-wife's in your office.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.871
She says she needs to talk to you.
- What?

06:54.956 --> 06:56.498
Yeah. In there.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.834
You're doing great. See you in a month.

07:02.004 --> 07:04.423
Hi.
- Angela, what are you doing here?

07:05.133 --> 07:08.260
I've got something really
important to talk to you about.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.887
You might want to sit down.
- I'm busy, Angela.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.681
I'm, pregnant, Larry.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.475
Really?

07:21.732 --> 07:23.150
That's wonderful.

07:25.319 --> 07:28.071
How long?
- Seven weeks, give or take.

07:33.536 --> 07:37.038
The Kelman wedding. The
night of the Kelman wedding.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.211
Yeah, that's the only time we did it.
- No.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.760
He was in and out of
my life very quickly.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.348
Not quickly enough, apparently.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.935
He who?
- It's not important.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.438
You sure it's not mine?

08:01.522 --> 08:03.690
Come on. After all the years we tried

08:03.774 --> 08:07.194
I don't think it's going to
happen one night, by accident.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.822
Thought maybe one of mine could
have bribed his way in or something.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.074
What do you want from me, Angela?

08:13.784 --> 08:15.243
I want you to be my doctor.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.704
Thank you very much, Angela, but I...

08:17.872 --> 08:20.832
Even if I wanted to, I
couldn't. We're related.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.627
Not since the divorce.
- Dr. Arbogast.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.962
Dr. Arbogast.
- In a minute!

08:27.882 --> 08:29.591
No. That's final.

08:30.801 --> 08:35.764
I'll ask Ned if he's got any room. If
there's anybody better than me, it' Ned.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.642
I'm sorry. Noah Banes is on
one. He says it's important.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.852
Ned Sneller? Forget it.
He looks at me, Larry.

08:41.979 --> 08:43.104
Banes.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.274
I'm, on my way.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.453
What seems to be the trouble?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.622
They've jammed the lock.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.882
Dr. Hesse, this is totally
unacceptable behavior.

09:10.967 --> 09:14.344
Open this door, now.
- I will miss you most of all.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.848
Pop the hinges.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.684
Banes. What's going on?

09:23.020 --> 09:26.856
Dr. Arbogast, good news
and bad news, I'm afraid.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.901
FDA decision, wicked bad news.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.237
They turned us down?
- I'm afraid so.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.781
And the review board has
terminated our project.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.993
I'm sorry, but lab space is
tight, and money's even tighter.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.328
They canceled the project.
- Please, Banes.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.456
I got $300,000 in this drug.
You got to cut me some slack.

09:43.541 --> 09:47.460
Would that I could, but it's out
of my hands. Blame the review board.

09:48.337 --> 09:49.713
You're head of the board.

09:49.797 --> 09:52.757
Yes, I am. Rock and a hard place.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.136
What's the good news?

09:56.220 --> 09:58.847
Well, I really hate
to dance on your grave.

09:59.432 --> 10:03.184
But I landed Dr. Diana Reddin
and her ovum cryogenics project.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.064
I need you to be extremely
careful with this.

10:08.149 --> 10:11.276
Lady, if I hear that one more time...
- They're very fragile.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.904
I've just got to set the
level for the incliners.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.782
Don't touch that!
- You shouldn't be up there!

10:17.867 --> 10:20.368
Stop! No!

10:22.121 --> 10:24.456
Help me! Help me! Help me now!

10:25.958 --> 10:27.876
My babies!
- Out of the way!

10:35.009 --> 10:37.594
Thank you. Thank you.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.722
That's not necessary.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.058
Get off me.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.060
Sorry.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.650
Thank you so very much.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.234
Leave me alone.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.196
Dr. Reddin? Are you all right?
- Yes.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.324
I'm fine. Thank you.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.409
No harm done.
- No.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.580
Are they...?

11:09.043 --> 11:13.046
Okay, let me just
check these. Thank God.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.883
They're all right. They're all right.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.469
Frozen eggs, huh?

11:19.553 --> 11:22.430
Yes. I call it the dairy section.

11:25.017 --> 11:28.603
If it weren't for the
lightning reflexes of...

11:28.854 --> 11:30.689
Where is he? He's gone.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.983
Hesse!
- Dr. Hesse has left the building.

11:35.653 --> 11:40.573
Wait. It's his laboratory, isn't it?

11:42.159 --> 11:43.910
Was.
- You like it?

11:44.745 --> 11:48.248
Yes. But I don't want
to displace anybody.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.958
You won't be, I promise.

11:50.042 --> 11:54.129
Take the chimps back to the primate
lab. We won't be needing them anymore.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.226
Hesse!

12:09.103 --> 12:12.313
Where you going?
- I'm going back to Europe to start over.

12:12.398 --> 12:16.234
You're running out on me? I don't
believe this. What are you doing?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.653
We're partners. You can't just leave.

12:18.738 --> 12:22.574
We're not partners anymore. I have
no lab, no funding, no future here.

12:22.658 --> 12:26.745
Wait a minute. What about all the
people you'd be leaving behind?

12:26.829 --> 12:29.247
What about your girlfriend?
What's her name again?

12:29.331 --> 12:32.375
I don't have a girlfriend.
- You're better off.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.377
How about your colleagues?

12:34.462 --> 12:36.129
I happen to know for a fact

12:36.213 --> 12:39.424
that your skill and dedication
is an inspiration to everybody.

12:39.508 --> 12:40.967
They'd be lost without you.

12:41.051 --> 12:44.262
They will find someone else to
mimic over coffee in the lounge.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.639
That's not true. They don't do that.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.309
Come on.
- I'm not well liked.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.561
I like you.
- No, you don't.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.732
I talked to my guy at Lyndon
Pharmaceutical, the Canadian firm.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.693
Larry. Good-bye. - They'll
give us additional funding

12:58.778 --> 13:01.821
provided we find a volunteer
for an Expectane protocol.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.199
Can't do the protocol
without FDA approval.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.159
We can if we don't tell the FDA.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.453
Are we going to let
Washington bureaucrats

13:08.537 --> 13:10.330
stand in the way of progress?

13:10.372 --> 13:13.500
What woman will take an unapproved
drug while she's pregnant?

13:13.584 --> 13:15.543
Who says we need a woman?

13:19.381 --> 13:20.965
What are you talking about?

13:21.050 --> 13:24.511
The experiment wouldn't have
to identify the subject's sex.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.055
Just the human tissue reactives.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.183
Remember Moe?

13:30.267 --> 13:33.186
The monkey? He went five months to term.

13:33.270 --> 13:36.147
You mean to do the test on a man?
- Why not?

13:38.317 --> 13:40.568
Are you allergic to anything?

13:41.612 --> 13:43.530
To me? You're nuts.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.910
Boarding pass?
- I don't have a boarding pass.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.497
Only ticketed passengers with
boarding passes beyond this point.

13:52.581 --> 13:53.706
Hear me out!

13:54.416 --> 13:56.251
Sir, I need your ticket.

13:58.295 --> 14:01.172
Gate 68B to Paris.
- Quick. Thank you very much.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.681
Pardon me. Excuse me.

14:09.807 --> 14:13.518
Sorry. Excuse me. Pardon me.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.312
Oh, my God.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.902
You wouldn't be pregnant pregnant.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.321
Sort of guest host situation.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.407
We fertilize the egg.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.951
We implant it in the peritoneal cavity.

14:30.035 --> 14:34.372
Dose it with Expectane.
Tiny thing, grain of rice.

14:34.456 --> 14:39.419
You carry it through the first trimester.
We get our data. Boom, it's over.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.925
4A. To your left.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.636
51F. All the way back.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.555
I'm going to just go...

14:52.808 --> 14:55.143
I guess I was wrong about you, Hesse.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.562
I took you for a scientist.

14:57.646 --> 15:00.023
I am a scientist.
- Yeah?

15:00.107 --> 15:01.566
Where's your vision?

15:01.650 --> 15:05.153
Jenner infected himself with
smallpox to test his vaccine.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.572
That's Jenner.
- So why not you?

15:08.449 --> 15:10.783
Is it possible? Who knows?

15:11.118 --> 15:12.243
Natural?

15:12.870 --> 15:14.078
So what?

15:15.456 --> 15:19.459
Good science? You bet.

15:21.545 --> 15:24.339
Come and claim your
place in the Pantheon.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.884
You're just trying to manipulate me.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.511
Yes, I am. So what?

15:30.596 --> 15:33.306
Excuse me. I have to ask
you to take your seat.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.642
Yeah, all right. Just a second.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.436
Look, cards on the table.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.856
I don't like you any
more than you like me.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.901
You got all the warmth and
charm of a walleyed pike.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.486
If we weren't partners...

15:50.449 --> 15:52.742
But the point is, we are partners.

15:53.410 --> 15:56.245
We're on the verge of
something fantastic.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.748
Something important.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.211
I need you to carry it through with me.

16:17.434 --> 16:21.104
This could really work.
- Yes, it could.

16:22.523 --> 16:26.109
Are you sure you can find an egg?
- No problem.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.784
Okay, who's the lucky one?

16:40.916 --> 16:45.378
Okay, Junior, let's go for a ride.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.152
God. Dr. Arbogast.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.070
Dr. Reddin, what are you doing here?
- Where?

17:13.866 --> 17:15.992
I don't know... Where am I?

17:16.910 --> 17:19.871
Oh, the lab. Good. Excellent.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.789
My lab. My lab.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.752
So what brings you here?

17:26.878 --> 17:31.466
It's like when a ball player gets traded

17:31.592 --> 17:35.928
and he goes to the ballpark.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.014
He comes back an, you know, just

17:38.140 --> 17:41.309
alone with his thoughts.

17:42.019 --> 17:45.188
Just to memorize the turf

17:45.314 --> 17:46.689
the infield

17:48.025 --> 17:49.901
the angles of the light.

17:53.655 --> 17:54.822
What?

17:58.160 --> 18:03.247
You have a piece of cheese.
- Sorry. It's from my sandwich.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.043
So what are you doing in this lab?

18:08.003 --> 18:10.546
Here, right over there.
- Thanks.

18:10.672 --> 18:15.051
Actually, I'm... I see
you kept Minnie and Moe.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.552
Yes, Minnie and Moe.
- Kept them.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.931
I could hardly turn out an
expectant mother, could I?

18:20.349 --> 18:24.268
No. Well, Alex will be very happy.
- Good.

18:24.394 --> 18:29.440
Because I get the feeling that Dr. Hesse
blames me for the less of his facility.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.068
He did take it kind of hard.

18:32.820 --> 18:36.781
I'd hate to see his work go
unfinished due to budget constrains.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.325
Would you tell him that I'd
be more than happy to help out

18:39.493 --> 18:43.162
with lab time an
materials, even some space

18:43.288 --> 18:47.333
if, I don't know what you think,
he might be amenable to sharing.

18:48.710 --> 18:52.380
That would be extremely generous

18:52.506 --> 18:55.466
and more helpful than you can imagine.

18:55.592 --> 18:59.137
So, is there a Mr. Dr. Reddin?

19:00.055 --> 19:00.972
Who?

19:03.517 --> 19:04.642
No.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.565
No, no, no.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.734
Sorry.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.903
Maybe we could have dinner sometime.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.029
No.
- No.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.160
Your back?
- Yeah, back.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.454
So...
- You're off.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.831
Bye.
- Bye.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.541
Thanks for coming.
- Okay.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.681
Way to go.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.151
This is it.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.285
Terrific motility.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.040
Excellent count.
- Let me see.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.634
Strong swimmers. Big load. Way to go.

20:20.219 --> 20:25.056
2:45 a.m., subject takes 15 cc Expectane

20:25.807 --> 20:28.517
supplemented with 100
milligrams of progesterone

20:28.644 --> 20:31.854
two milligrams of estrogen.

20:35.859 --> 20:36.943
Salud.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.952
So how's the Expectane taste?
- Bitter.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.997
Well, we'll add some
flavoring when we market it.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.124
Good idea.

20:53.168 --> 20:56.504
All right. Let's find the spot.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.432
All right, let's see. Peritoneal cavity.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.436
Let's see here.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.525
That looks like a good,
clear window right there.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.987
There's plenty of room for the
embryo through the first trimester.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.614
A little lower.
- Yeah.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.992
Right over here.
- That's it.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.285
All right.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.127
Let's put a bun in your oven.

21:38.213 --> 21:40.423
Where did you get the egg, by the way?

21:41.883 --> 21:43.009
The egg?

21:44.011 --> 21:47.596
Colleague of mine. An anonymous harvest.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.100
Had a couple of spare. Just relax.

21:59.234 --> 22:02.111
Here we go. Yeah.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.784
Navigating.

23:18.855 --> 23:29.365
Mama.

23:37.874 --> 23:40.418
What? Hi.

23:41.503 --> 23:44.255
Where am I?
- This is my house.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.049
You're staying with me
during the protocol, remember?

23:48.009 --> 23:49.802
Let's see how you are.

23:51.555 --> 23:52.638
I forgot.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.105
Here. Put that under your tongue.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.986
This your bedroom?

24:07.612 --> 24:10.614
No, it's my ex-wife's bedroom.

24:10.699 --> 24:11.907
Cheery, huh?

24:13.034 --> 24:14.827
She decorated it herself.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.914
She had taste. Give her that.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.626
You had separate bedrooms?

24:23.962 --> 24:26.589
No. We didn't always
have separate bedrooms.

24:29.801 --> 24:33.762
Good. There are many stops
along the road to divorce.

24:35.307 --> 24:38.184
Blood pressure good.
Let's check this out.

24:40.687 --> 24:42.438
Normal. Very good.

24:43.398 --> 24:46.442
I have to pee.
- I need that, too. Here.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.235
Fill her up.

24:51.573 --> 24:56.535
We're going to do the tests at
8:00 a.m. and again at 10:00 p.m.

24:59.581 --> 25:02.666
I got a prenatal monitor and
a blood screener ordered up.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.920
Do you mind? Can I have some privacy?

25:08.215 --> 25:11.467
You know, it was really nice of
Dr. Reddin to let us share her lab.

25:11.593 --> 25:14.637
I'll go there to analyze and
collate the fluid sampler.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.639
All right. Sounds good.

25:21.811 --> 25:23.145
That should be enough.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.566
All right now, this watch is
set to go off every four hours

25:27.692 --> 25:29.527
to remind you to take the Expectane.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.530
What do you think? Six
times a day should do it.

25:33.573 --> 25:34.990
That should do it.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.789
Let's see how we did.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.422
I must be crazy to be doing this.

25:57.180 --> 26:01.559
You may be crazy, but
you're also pregnant.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.186
Congratulations.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.568
I'm pregnant.

26:15.657 --> 26:19.493
So embryo three is entering
its two-to-four stage.

26:19.661 --> 26:22.788
Today we'll be extracting
an eight-cell cluster

26:22.914 --> 26:24.832
an freezing it

26:26.960 --> 26:30.546
for induced suspension
and development arrest.

26:30.630 --> 26:33.090
Dr. Hesse? Can I get you anything?
- I'm looking for any

26:33.174 --> 26:38.429
cryogenic disruption
to the DNA footprints.

26:38.513 --> 26:42.349
He's fine.
- Good. Excellent.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.520
Let's go on with it, okay?
- What about this?

26:49.232 --> 26:52.109
Here to see the new mama!
- Hi, Dr. Arbogast.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.653
Hi!
- Banana, they'll love it.

26:54.779 --> 26:56.405
Mother and daughter are doing fine.

26:58.533 --> 27:02.578
She's a pretty baby.
Looks just like you.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.788
Got your ears.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.418
You like that?
- You can eat it.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.754
Don't you want to eat it?
- Yeah.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.841
Hey, big guy, how're they swinging?

27:16.718 --> 27:19.970
What's the matter? You okay?
- Yeah.

27:20.263 --> 27:21.597
What, what?

27:23.516 --> 27:25.976
Look, my HCG levels aren't
where they should be.

27:27.103 --> 27:30.606
Let's up the hormone
supplement five milliliters.

27:31.441 --> 27:32.858
How you feeling otherwise?

27:34.819 --> 27:36.695
I just can't keep anything down.

27:37.155 --> 27:40.032
That's morning sickness.
It'll pass. Eat crackers.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.912
My nipples are very sensitive.

27:45.997 --> 27:46.914
What?

27:47.999 --> 27:51.418
My nipples, they feel
like, kind of, tingling.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.880
Tingling like sore or like itchy?
- You surf?

27:55.674 --> 27:59.718
Surf, because I got that
a lot from paddling out.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.721
It's something about the wax and
the salt water. It irritates them.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.932
You get what?
- His nipples are tingling.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.769
I don' surf.
- It could be your laundry detergent.

28:08.895 --> 28:11.522
I used to get that when I
used a non-biodegradable soap.

28:11.648 --> 28:14.441
Thank you for your
concern. It's very nice.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.402
Or it could be that polyester shirt.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.364
I don't know how much
more of this I can handle.

28:20.490 --> 28:23.534
You're doing great. I
talked to my guy at Lyndon.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.120
They saw the initial
data. They are ecstatic.

28:26.246 --> 28:29.456
I'll meet with their CEO at the
convention in San Francisco next month.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.167
What? Cramps?

28:32.961 --> 28:35.337
Come on. Get up. Let's
go walk it off. Let's go.

28:36.881 --> 28:37.881
Let's go.

28:44.639 --> 28:47.141
I don't want to cut back
the hormones altogether.

28:47.267 --> 28:50.436
It'll jeopardize the protocol. A
tingle and tummy ache won't kill you.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.648
Boy, here she comes.

28:55.692 --> 28:56.817
Excuse me.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.277
Just what we need.

28:58.987 --> 29:00.571
I know this is none of my business.

29:00.655 --> 29:03.532
I can't help but notice
the lethargy, the nausea

29:03.700 --> 29:06.535
the vials you keep leaving
in the wastepaper basket.

29:06.828 --> 29:07.786
Yes?

29:09.706 --> 29:12.249
Do you have a substance abusing problem?

29:12.333 --> 29:13.709
What?
- No!

29:13.835 --> 29:15.586
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.255
I was involved in a study in
Oxford where it was categoric...

29:21.509 --> 29:24.094
This is serious. I'm very concerned.

29:24.846 --> 29:28.015
It's been going on for nearly a month,
and I think he should see someone.

29:31.686 --> 29:37.274
There is a tragic disease that afflicts
the men of his village in Austria.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.652
They even named it after the place.

29:40.779 --> 29:44.740
It's called, "Gelandensprung Syndrome".

29:44.866 --> 29:46.784
"Gelandensprung"?
- Yeah.

29:47.243 --> 29:48.869
You've heard of it?
- No.

29:48.995 --> 29:54.249
I'm not surprised. It's endemic to
only a few places in all the world.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.001
Well, what is it?

29:58.421 --> 30:02.132
It's a terrible, debilitating

30:02.258 --> 30:05.469
relentless, you know, kind of...

30:05.887 --> 30:07.012
Fatness.

30:07.096 --> 30:08.430
"Fatness".
- "Fatness"?

30:09.307 --> 30:13.352
Striking young men in their
prime, turning them into big

30:13.436 --> 30:17.147
wheezing...
- Strudelhunds.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.191
" Strudelhunds".
- " Strudelhunds"?

30:19.317 --> 30:23.862
Pastry hounds. Yeah, that's the

30:24.697 --> 30:26.657
insult that they hurl upon them.

30:28.868 --> 30:32.079
I'll go get you some crackers, because

30:32.205 --> 30:34.957
it'll head off trouble
that's approaching.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.375
He'll be all right.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.962
Banes!
- But you're not fat.

30:41.464 --> 30:44.216
Because I'm taking a new formula.

30:44.968 --> 30:49.137
I've only nine more
weeks of the protocol.

30:49.264 --> 30:52.599
It's funny how you don't appreciate
somebody until they're gone.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.727
I'm not gone. You're gone.
What do you want to talk about?

30:55.854 --> 30:58.438
It's about our contract.
Got a couple of minutes?

30:58.565 --> 31:01.775
Not really.
- I really need to talk to you.

31:03.653 --> 31:05.654
I feel so humiliated.

31:07.365 --> 31:11.368
Don't be. People get sick all the
time. There's no need to be ashamed.

31:12.453 --> 31:15.455
I feel like I've lost
control over my body.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.336
Control's important to you, isn't it?

31:23.506 --> 31:24.756
What do you mean?

31:25.925 --> 31:29.136
Same three shirts, week in, week out.

31:29.637 --> 31:31.263
Same coat peg

31:31.347 --> 31:36.018
same wash basin. That odd little ritual
with the liverwurst and apple every day.

31:36.519 --> 31:39.396
I like order. What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

31:39.939 --> 31:41.523
It's just an observation.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.192
And I don't like being sick.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.153
Is there anything wrong with that?

31:46.237 --> 31:51.283
It's just that men...
- Men what?

31:51.409 --> 31:54.745
They're pathetic when it comes to pain.

31:55.413 --> 31:58.624
You should try being a woman
sometime. It's a nightmare.

31:59.167 --> 32:02.961
Your body goes peculiar with your
period and doesn't stop until menopause.

32:03.046 --> 32:05.964
It's a lifetime of leaking and swelling

32:06.090 --> 32:08.216
and spotting and smears.

32:08.801 --> 32:12.012
Crippling cramps,
raging hormones, yeasts!

32:12.138 --> 32:13.847
And that's if everything's normal.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.184
I never wanted to be a woman.
- I'm just saying.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.022
That's perfectly normal. Not to worry.

32:22.357 --> 32:23.607
Just stay off your feet.

32:23.733 --> 32:26.777
Use an ice pack for a few minutes
every hour and call me in the morning.

32:27.987 --> 32:30.405
It's okay, that's why I'm here.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.534
Bye.
- Look at this.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.459
Leave 'em alone.

32:43.378 --> 32:46.380
Don't snap at me.
- Angela, this is my house now.

32:46.506 --> 32:50.842
You may live here. You may die here,
but this will always be my house.

32:51.177 --> 32:54.513
Floral, hound's tooth, then paisley.

32:56.432 --> 33:01.019
Angela, Alex. Colleague of mine.

33:02.271 --> 33:03.814
Nice to meet you.

33:04.607 --> 33:07.192
God, excuse me.
- Charmed.

33:09.278 --> 33:11.363
I'm going upstairs to my bedroom.

33:14.283 --> 33:15.909
He's

33:16.035 --> 33:19.287
going through a confusing time. He's
staying here for a couple of weeks.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.415
So what do you want?

33:22.041 --> 33:23.625
I don't like Sneller.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.294
We've been over this.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.797
Ned Sneller is a top guy.

33:28.881 --> 33:33.260
He's creepy. I'm not going back to him.
- You're being ridiculous.

33:33.386 --> 33:37.931
I can't deal with this. Where's the father?
- I haven't able to reach him.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.516
He disappeared?

33:39.642 --> 33:43.854
They're touring. I don't know.
Europe, Asia? I can't remember which.

33:45.606 --> 33:46.857
Who is?

33:49.610 --> 33:50.986
Aerosmith.

33:53.614 --> 33:56.116
One of Aerosmith knocked you up?

33:56.200 --> 33:58.368
What a lovely phrase.

33:58.453 --> 33:59.828
Excuse me.

33:59.954 --> 34:03.123
I'm a little shocked here.
- You're going to have to deal with it.

34:03.249 --> 34:06.251
I don't have to deal with
it. We're divorced. Remember?

34:06.627 --> 34:09.087
It's not like I'm
asking you to fix my car.

34:10.590 --> 34:15.469
Call Louise in the morning
and she'll fit you in.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.304
Thank you.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.103
I am happy for you.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.355
Thanks, Lar.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.016
What's the matter?

35:46.435 --> 35:48.770
She was Daddy's little girl.

35:49.939 --> 35:52.065
Now he's giving her away.

35:53.067 --> 35:56.319
Come on. Get a grip.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.699
Physically, you're in tiptop shape.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.367
Everything's right on track.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.828
One more week.
- Okay.

36:10.209 --> 36:11.501
I'm sorry.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.712
I'm just not myself.

36:15.923 --> 36:17.215
Just relax.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.469
Don't wait up for me
tonight. I'll be late.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.430
Why? Where are you going?

36:24.473 --> 36:27.767
To the pharmaceutical convention at
the Hyatt. I'm meeting the Lyndon guys.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.312
The convention is tonight?

36:30.938 --> 36:33.440
I told you it was tonight.

36:34.233 --> 36:36.985
Please take me with you.

36:37.111 --> 36:41.740
No. You stay home. Get back
in bed and just take it easy.

36:41.824 --> 36:45.076
You don't understand.
- I do understand. No!

36:45.203 --> 36:49.039
Please, listen to me.
- No. It's bad for business.

36:49.123 --> 36:50.790
I'm pregnant and all alone.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.709
Will you stop saying that?

36:52.793 --> 36:57.088
You're not pregnant pregnant. You
got to think of this as an experiment.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.925
Think of it like you
swallowed a piece of gum.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.469
A tiny piece. Dentyne.

37:02.553 --> 37:08.141
I won't be in your way. I'll
take walks. I'll disappear.

37:08.267 --> 37:10.227
I feel so isolated.

37:12.313 --> 37:16.316
Okay, you can come. But don't
do that thing with your eyes.

37:17.151 --> 37:18.985
I can come?
- Yes.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.114
But I have nothing to wear.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.159
I'm starting to get a
little headache over here.

37:44.178 --> 37:46.763
I feel we could make a
definite contribution here.

37:46.847 --> 37:47.722
Sounds good.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.766
Excellent.

37:49.892 --> 37:51.226
And you got to remember

37:51.352 --> 37:55.730
we're talking about five million
prescriptions a year in the US, minimum.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.816
What's the window on the
human experiment results?

37:57.942 --> 38:01.403
Between you and I, you'll
see results within a week.

38:01.487 --> 38:02.654
That fast?
- Yes.

38:02.780 --> 38:06.950
We are very impressed. Keep us posted.
- Thank you.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.496
Interesting pitch, Larry.

38:11.580 --> 38:15.292
What are you doing here?
- You know me.

38:15.668 --> 38:17.502
I like to keep my ear to the ground.

38:18.587 --> 38:23.466
You know that human experimentation is
against University and FDA guidelines.

38:23.592 --> 38:27.304
I'm just trying to raise some
awareness and some new money

38:27.430 --> 38:29.764
telling people we're further
along than we really are.

38:29.932 --> 38:32.058
Is there a woman out
there taking Expectane?

38:32.810 --> 38:34.686
Absolutely not.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.775
Where have you been?
- I had so much fun.

38:40.901 --> 38:44.195
I had a walk and the most
wonderful message in a health club.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.324
I had a great time. Then I took
a nap right there on the table.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.910
Franks in blankets?
These are my favorites.

38:52.079 --> 38:54.122
Alex, you look

38:56.083 --> 38:57.250
radiant.

38:57.418 --> 38:59.753
Thank you.
- We should be going. Let's go.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.755
Want some franks in blankets?
- No.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.220
I'm sorry.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.806
It's a wonder the woman is still alive.

39:12.475 --> 39:15.226
She looks so beautiful
tonight, don't you think so?

39:18.147 --> 39:19.898
Where have you been?

39:21.942 --> 39:24.027
Long line for the loo.
- Hors d'oeuvres?

39:24.153 --> 39:26.112
Sausage rolls. Thank you. I love these.

39:26.864 --> 39:28.114
These are my favorites.

39:33.537 --> 39:34.913
You look so...

39:37.500 --> 39:39.125
I don't know.

39:39.585 --> 39:42.837
Enthusiastic.
- Yes, you do. You look positively lit up.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.589
What's the good news?
- No good news!

39:44.715 --> 39:45.548
Life.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.675
Music and friends.

39:47.885 --> 39:51.971
Franks in the blanket. I love it.
- I think we should be going. Let's go.

39:52.098 --> 39:53.056
We should go.

39:53.182 --> 39:55.392
Going, always going.

39:56.602 --> 39:58.061
And one day, gone.

40:00.773 --> 40:02.190
Just like that.

40:03.484 --> 40:07.570
When we should be pausing to hear
the joyful melody of life itself.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.868
He doesn't get out much.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.539
Neither do I.

40:28.342 --> 40:30.301
I always loved this song.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.720
Would you like to dance?
- Would you like to dance?

40:36.350 --> 40:37.809
I don't know.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.145
I've never danced before either.

40:40.813 --> 40:43.565
Then, I think we should give it a try.
- Good.

40:44.024 --> 40:47.235
Could you hold this? Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.237
Where you going?

41:34.742 --> 41:37.035
Okay?
- All right.

42:34.510 --> 42:35.635
Excuse me.

42:38.264 --> 42:39.430
I found it.

43:04.248 --> 43:06.749
Prince Charming, the coach is leaving.

43:11.839 --> 43:14.382
Thank you. I enjoyed that very much.

43:14.925 --> 43:17.135
I loved it. Let's do it again.

43:18.220 --> 43:19.220
Good night.

43:19.305 --> 43:23.558
Now, what is taking so long? They
lost it, I know. Why have a ticket?

43:27.187 --> 43:28.396
What are you doing?

43:28.522 --> 43:30.398
Come over here.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.609
What are you doing?

43:33.152 --> 43:35.028
Feel how soft my skin is.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.363
It's time.

43:37.489 --> 43:39.240
We're closing out the experiment.

43:39.325 --> 43:43.369
Banes is sniffing around and
your hormones are out of control.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.956
There's still a week left
until the trimester is over.

43:47.082 --> 43:49.751
We have plenty of data.
The Lyndon guys are poised.

43:49.918 --> 43:51.753
I don't want to risk
anything going wrong.

43:53.964 --> 43:55.423
Come on.

44:01.263 --> 44:02.096
What?

44:04.183 --> 44:06.851
I can't help but wonder
what it would be like.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.897
What what would be like?

44:12.066 --> 44:13.524
To have my baby.

44:14.109 --> 44:17.570
That's it. We're closing out
the experiment tonight. Now.

44:17.696 --> 44:19.447
Get in the car. Come on.

44:20.699 --> 44:22.200
"To have my baby".

44:22.868 --> 44:24.702
"Feel how soft my skin is".

44:24.828 --> 44:27.413
Where'd you go, to France
to get the car or something?

44:27.998 --> 44:30.875
I never realized how lonely I was.
- Get a dog!

44:44.890 --> 44:48.309
What are you gloomy about?
Come on. The experiment worked.

44:59.405 --> 45:00.655
With Moe

45:01.490 --> 45:03.908
I tapered off the dosage gradually.

45:04.451 --> 45:07.537
To aid his system with
the hormonal rebalancing.

45:07.663 --> 45:09.872
You go cold turkey.

45:10.374 --> 45:13.751
You may have a couple of rocky days, but
I don't want to risk any complications.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.878
Just stop taking the Expectane.

45:16.505 --> 45:19.966
The embryo will break down and be
reabsorbed naturally into your body.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.223
Home sweet home.

45:38.026 --> 45:41.404
I'll get all the data
over to the guys at Lyndon.

45:41.530 --> 45:45.992
I'll be in touch with you as
soon as I hear anything, okay?

45:51.540 --> 45:54.459
If you have a reaction, call me.
- Sure.

46:49.932 --> 46:52.767
I don't know if you're a boy or a girl

46:54.228 --> 46:56.187
so I'll call you Junior.

47:58.208 --> 47:59.542
What a surprise.

47:59.626 --> 48:01.752
How'd you know?
- We looked it up in your file.

48:01.879 --> 48:03.087
Did you bake this?

48:05.173 --> 48:08.301
Did you bake this yourself?
- The ingredients mutated a bit.

48:08.427 --> 48:09.802
Happy birthday, big guy.

48:14.474 --> 48:17.518
You're sweating like a
racehorse. You all right?

48:17.603 --> 48:18.978
It's hot in here.

48:19.062 --> 48:20.771
No, it's not.
- I'm really hot.

48:20.898 --> 48:23.482
What? You got a fever?
- I made the icing.

48:33.285 --> 48:35.578
You think you're the first clown
who woke up one day and said:

48:35.704 --> 48:37.622
"I'm bored. I think I'll have a kid."

48:38.123 --> 48:40.333
I didn't say that. Why
are you being so negative?

48:40.417 --> 48:42.293
Hello? Anybody home?

48:42.711 --> 48:44.211
You're a guy.

48:44.296 --> 48:47.882
This is totally against the natural
order. Guys do not have babies.

48:48.008 --> 48:51.093
We leave that to women. That's
part of the beauty of being a guy.

48:51.261 --> 48:53.638
Didn't your father ever
have this talk with you?

48:53.764 --> 48:56.766
If you don't want to help,
say so. I don't need a lecture.

48:56.850 --> 48:58.100
The hell you don't.

48:58.226 --> 49:01.562
If you could feel for a minute
the sense of joy and connection

49:01.647 --> 49:03.856
that carrying your baby
brings, you'd understand.

49:03.941 --> 49:07.818
Listen to you. Have you lost
it completely? Now, come inside.

49:08.779 --> 49:11.530
If I carry this baby to
term, it'll be a miracle.

49:11.657 --> 49:15.076
I'd love, protect and nurture that
miracle with everything I have.

49:15.202 --> 49:17.411
Stop it!
- No! I want my baby!

49:23.794 --> 49:25.169
Sorry, I'm late.

49:27.172 --> 49:29.799
We'll just be a couple
minutes, then I'm ready.

49:29.925 --> 49:32.176
Your ex-wife's inside. You're
late for her appointment.

49:32.260 --> 49:34.261
Hello, Dr. Hesse.
- Come here, sit down.

49:34.388 --> 49:36.222
I don't want to sit around here.
- Sit down!

49:38.392 --> 49:39.517
Right here.

49:44.231 --> 49:47.066
There's nothing to be afraid
of. He thinks he's pregnant.

49:47.150 --> 49:48.651
It's a fascinating case.

49:48.777 --> 49:51.612
I'm working with the
University's psychiatric center.

49:51.697 --> 49:54.657
Auto-physiological suggestion.

49:55.283 --> 49:56.659
What's going on?
- Get in there.

50:07.838 --> 50:11.215
How're you doing?
- How are you? Nice to see you.

50:11.299 --> 50:12.925
You're looking good.
- Thanks.

50:13.051 --> 50:14.760
Okay, you can go.
- That's it?

50:14.845 --> 50:17.763
Something very important came up.

50:17.889 --> 50:20.433
I'm important.
- You are. Very.

50:20.559 --> 50:24.562
But this is urgent. Get dressed
and we'll reschedule. Sorry.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.481
How far along are you?

50:28.191 --> 50:29.692
Twenty-one weeks.

50:30.527 --> 50:33.029
Is this your first?
- Yes.

50:35.282 --> 50:37.158
Have you thought of any names?

50:39.953 --> 50:41.996
Junior, if it's a boy.

50:44.166 --> 50:45.875
And if it's a girl

50:47.878 --> 50:49.003
Junior.

50:49.588 --> 50:50.838
Those are nice.

50:51.506 --> 50:53.132
How about you?
- Alex.

50:57.387 --> 50:58.554
Excuse me.

50:59.347 --> 51:01.182
Good luck.
- Thank you.

51:05.604 --> 51:07.563
Junior would be good.
- Junior's good.

51:09.316 --> 51:10.566
There's the feet

51:10.984 --> 51:12.234
and the hands.

51:13.236 --> 51:14.779
This can't be happening.

51:15.113 --> 51:16.280
But it is.

51:20.118 --> 51:21.660
That little string of pearls.

51:22.537 --> 51:24.455
The spine.
- That's the spine, yeah.

51:28.835 --> 51:30.086
There's the head.

51:35.967 --> 51:37.301
My baby.

51:38.845 --> 51:40.096
Listen to this.

51:45.143 --> 51:46.268
That's the heartbeat.

51:47.562 --> 51:48.896
That's very fast.

51:49.856 --> 51:51.565
140 beats a minute.

51:52.567 --> 51:53.734
Perfectly normal.

51:56.947 --> 51:58.030
In fact

51:58.740 --> 52:00.533
everything's perfectly normal.

52:01.952 --> 52:04.662
Except for the fact that
the mom is also the dad.

52:08.375 --> 52:12.962
If this gets out, your life is over.

52:13.088 --> 52:15.548
You're a freak. My license? Kiss it good-bye.

52:15.674 --> 52:17.341
It's not going to get out.

52:17.926 --> 52:22.012
I know this is unfair to you.
And it's dangerous for both of us

52:22.764 --> 52:24.473
but I want my baby.

52:26.351 --> 52:28.018
And I need your help.

52:31.773 --> 52:34.900
Move back in with me. I want you
off your feet as much as possible.

52:34.985 --> 52:37.194
And no going to the lab.

52:37.612 --> 52:39.613
But...
- No buts about it.

52:40.198 --> 52:43.409
You're in a lot of sacrifices.
You'd better get used to that.

52:48.915 --> 52:53.377
So, otherwise how are you feeling?

52:54.921 --> 52:56.338
Anything unusual?

52:56.798 --> 53:00.009
Jesus, what the heck am I
talking about? "Anything unusual"?

53:01.178 --> 53:03.637
I've noticed the side effects
of pregnancy are amplified

53:03.763 --> 53:06.765
with the dosage of
Expectane that I've required.

53:06.850 --> 53:09.894
The morning sickness, the mood swings.

53:10.645 --> 53:12.771
Sleepiness, sexual appetite.

53:12.898 --> 53:14.231
Sexual appetite?

53:15.483 --> 53:19.111
Yesterday, just scooping the middle
out of a honeydew melon gave me

53:20.197 --> 53:22.198
a Steifen.
- A what?

53:24.159 --> 53:25.409
That's normal.

53:26.328 --> 53:27.661
I get them all the time.

53:32.417 --> 53:33.876
It's nice to be back.

53:35.837 --> 53:37.463
It's going to be a lot of fun.

53:38.256 --> 53:40.758
Do I have the same room again?
- You betcha.

53:41.384 --> 53:44.428
What do you want to do tonight?
Should we stay in or go out for dinner?

53:47.515 --> 53:50.476
Didn't I close down the
Expectane project six moths ago?

53:52.145 --> 53:55.105
Then why would Diana Reddin's

53:55.232 --> 53:57.650
requisitions for Expectane components?

53:58.193 --> 54:01.403
Is she up to something
with Arbogast and Hesse?

54:03.198 --> 54:04.949
I don't know, sir.

54:07.118 --> 54:08.827
Larry, I'm not whining.

54:10.288 --> 54:13.374
It's just that you said you'd
be home no later than 6:00.

54:13.500 --> 54:18.587
It's 6:45. The pasta is ready.
In five minutes, they'll be soft.

54:19.422 --> 54:21.924
Well, fine, then come
home whenever you want!

54:23.260 --> 54:24.677
Selfish.

54:31.601 --> 54:35.479
Diana. Hi.
- Yes, it's me. Hello.

54:36.398 --> 54:39.108
Someone gave me these papers for you

54:39.567 --> 54:41.277
from the lab.
- Thank you.

54:42.320 --> 54:47.116
Who?

54:54.624 --> 54:55.833
I'm lying.

54:56.710 --> 55:00.879
I just, actually, I
just wanted to see you.

55:01.798 --> 55:02.840
You did?

55:03.758 --> 55:06.010
Come in, please.
- Thank you.

55:06.803 --> 55:08.053
I'm sorry I lied.

55:08.805 --> 55:09.972
What a lovely room!

55:14.561 --> 55:16.854
Very nice of Dr. Arbogast to put you up.

55:18.606 --> 55:20.733
It is.
- Nice man.

55:22.694 --> 55:24.820
How are you? How are you feeling?

55:25.196 --> 55:26.447
Good. Thank you.

55:26.531 --> 55:27.656
And you?

55:29.159 --> 55:29.992
Good.

55:31.077 --> 55:33.370
Cooking?

55:33.872 --> 55:35.205
Smells very nice.

55:36.916 --> 55:38.292
You want to sit down?

55:38.835 --> 55:39.668
Please.

55:41.671 --> 55:43.839
Alex, do you believe in reincarnation

55:43.923 --> 55:47.092
past lives or anything like that?

55:48.845 --> 55:51.764
No.
- No, either do I, so it can't be that.

55:52.390 --> 55:53.599
Can't be what?

55:53.683 --> 55:56.602
I have this strong recurring
feeling that I know you.

55:57.312 --> 55:58.645
You do know me.

55:59.105 --> 56:02.149
I know.

56:03.026 --> 56:04.443
No, but I mean

56:04.569 --> 56:06.278
I mean from before

56:06.404 --> 56:07.946
somehow, from earlier.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.201
I was born in Jakarta.

56:13.328 --> 56:16.580
And raised in England, from
the age of five, in Kent

56:16.706 --> 56:19.458
and summers in Cornwall.

56:21.044 --> 56:22.378
What are you looking at?

56:23.755 --> 56:28.926
I was born in Austria,
in Gelandensprung.

56:29.302 --> 56:31.220
Home to the Strudelhunds.
- Yes.

56:33.223 --> 56:34.807
Well, I've never...

56:35.392 --> 56:37.434
I've never actually
been to Gelandensprung.

56:39.062 --> 56:40.687
Salzburg, once.

56:42.065 --> 56:43.565
Delicious chocolate.

56:44.943 --> 56:46.276
Good-looking waiters.

56:48.863 --> 56:50.948
Alex? - Yes?

56:51.783 --> 56:53.033
You're twitching.

56:55.703 --> 56:56.870
What's the matter?

57:02.585 --> 57:04.503
Does my body disgust you?

57:04.963 --> 57:06.964
What?
- My body?

57:08.466 --> 57:09.842
Is it disgusting?

57:16.307 --> 57:18.600
No! I mean, I like

57:18.685 --> 57:20.769
upholstery on a man.

57:20.895 --> 57:23.689
In fact, I was madly in love
with my cousin, Trevor, for years

57:23.815 --> 57:26.817
and he was very portly.

57:28.361 --> 57:30.070
Maybe it's physical.

57:31.739 --> 57:34.825
This connection.
- Yes. No, it is, definitely physical.

57:34.951 --> 57:39.329
Out of the blue, I get these sudden,
these pangs of concern for your...

57:39.789 --> 57:41.248
for your well...

57:44.919 --> 57:48.172
You mean sex?

57:49.048 --> 57:50.090
Yes.

57:53.303 --> 57:54.720
I hadn't thought of that.

57:55.847 --> 57:56.889
I have.

57:59.601 --> 58:00.642
Have you?

58:00.768 --> 58:04.396
Well, then, that's

58:06.149 --> 58:08.609
that's probably it then, isn't it?
- Yes.

58:16.743 --> 58:18.118
No, wait. Wait. If I...

58:23.791 --> 58:25.501
I let myself in.

58:31.174 --> 58:32.466
Where's Larry?

58:32.592 --> 58:35.302
He's out.
- Found it. There we go.

58:35.428 --> 58:37.513
It's in. Contact lens.

58:37.597 --> 58:40.599
Just flipped out, right over the sofa.
- Who's that?

58:41.184 --> 58:43.435
Dr. Diana Reddin. Nice to meet you.

58:44.354 --> 58:46.980
Going now. Bye. Good, you were right.

58:47.065 --> 58:50.275
Yes?
- I have my own bedroom.

58:50.360 --> 58:51.693
I'd love to see it sometime.

58:53.112 --> 58:55.572
I can't stay. I have to go.

59:00.119 --> 59:02.371
Got it.

59:12.173 --> 59:14.675
Do you ever think about
calling before you come over?

59:14.801 --> 59:16.802
I'm sorry if I interrupted.

59:19.722 --> 59:21.598
What is that great smell?

59:22.225 --> 59:23.308
I'm, cooking.

59:24.394 --> 59:25.435
You're cooking?

59:26.312 --> 59:27.145
What?

59:27.772 --> 59:28.814
Pasta.

59:28.898 --> 59:30.566
You want some more rocky road?

59:32.694 --> 59:37.573
She seems like a very nice person.
Definitively a little nervous.

59:41.327 --> 59:42.536
You think it's serious?

59:43.162 --> 59:46.373
I'm in a particularly vulnerable
stage in my life right now

59:46.499 --> 59:48.959
so I'm taking it slowly.

59:49.043 --> 59:50.377
That's very smart.

59:52.964 --> 59:54.506
Can I have more of those ribs?

59:55.008 --> 59:56.717
How about you and the father?

59:57.844 --> 01:00:00.887
Haven't heard from him since it happened.
- Bastard.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:04.266
I never expected to hear from him.

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:07.728
I'm happy. I love being pregnant.

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:11.148
It's just that I'm not
21 anymore. I'm single.

01:00:11.816 --> 01:00:14.735
It's a little bit scary.
- Tell me about it.

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:18.155
I love those pickels.

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.700
There's a couple of chicken wings left.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:30.834
What?

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.756
Anybody ever tell you that
you eat like a pregnant woman?

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:42.054
I just like mixing cuisines.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.562
Baby pushed.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.984
What's wrong with you?

01:00:57.945 --> 01:00:59.529
Sympathy pains.

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:01.657
I hardly know you.

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:04.451
You must be a very sympathetic guy.

01:01:06.245 --> 01:01:07.704
Lately, yes.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:13.919
I think she really likes me.
- Yeah?

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.671
What makes you say that?

01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:20.300
She said she likes a
little upholstery on a guy.

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:23.053
And she kissed me.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:25.389
You're kissing?

01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:26.848
Wait a minute.

01:01:26.974 --> 01:01:29.976
You're in no condition
to start a relationship.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.854
Don't be so negative.
- What do you mean, negative?

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:36.274
Wait a minute. I'm not negative.

01:01:37.985 --> 01:01:39.236
What do you think?

01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:42.614
Couldn't find one with a parrot on it?

01:01:44.742 --> 01:01:45.909
It's nice.

01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:51.248
I'm starting to believe in fate.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.417
My baby.

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:55.544
Finding a compatible woman.

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.546
I think it's all part of a design.

01:01:58.756 --> 01:02:01.717
Maybe I should see a psychic.
- Psychiatrist.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:03.635
We should both see him.

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.722
I hate my body.

01:02:07.348 --> 01:02:09.015
Looking prosperous there.

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:14.312
The pants are loose in the waist.
- I could take them in.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:16.231
Better leave room to grow.

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:19.735
That's a good idea.
- That's the spirit!

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.361
I'll cut them for you.
- Okay.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:27.909
What?
- Junior kicked again.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:30.746
Junior?
- Yeah.

01:02:31.205 --> 01:02:32.289
Why Junior?

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:35.709
The book says to talk to the baby.

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:38.628
I didn't know if it'll be a boy
or a girl. so I called it Junior.

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:39.880
Why?

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:41.631
Nothing. I was...

01:02:42.341 --> 01:02:44.551
It's something. You have that look.

01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:48.263
No, the guy I got the egg
from, he called it Junior.

01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:51.057
He was making a joke, you
know, just a funny coincidence.

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:55.645
Who is that guy? You said a colleague
of yours had an anonymous harvest.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.773
Yes, a colleague of mine.
- Do I know him?

01:02:57.857 --> 01:02:59.191
No, you don't know him.

01:02:59.984 --> 01:03:03.236
Do we know about the donor egg?
- No, it's anonymous.

01:03:04.238 --> 01:03:05.822
Well, well, how very domestic.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.700
All that's missing is the
pitter-patter of little feet.

01:03:08.826 --> 01:03:12.788
Forgotten, but not gone.
What the hell do you want?

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:17.250
I couldn't help overhearing
you. Something about a donor egg?

01:03:17.376 --> 01:03:18.794
I don't know what you mean.

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:22.130
Come on, guys, it's me,
Noah. I'm nobody's fool.

01:03:23.424 --> 01:03:25.300
I checked with the primate lab.

01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:29.012
They told me the chimps haven't been
tested on since the project was cancelled.

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:31.264
But you're still producing Expectane.

01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:37.687
Well, the truth is that

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:41.650
we had surplus of the steroid base.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:44.653
Rather than let it go to waste...
- Surplus.

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:46.571
...we decided to...
- We decided to...

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:50.450
...finish the production run...
- That's it.

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:54.204
...stockpile the
Expectane for when the FDA

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.540
does approve clinical trials.

01:03:56.707 --> 01:04:01.169
We were unaware of the University
policy, so that's why the little fib.

01:04:01.295 --> 01:04:05.507
If there are any budget overruns,
we're more than happy to cover the...

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:07.592
Excuse me.

01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:16.101
What's that all about?
- I don't know.

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:19.271
Are you writing a book?
- You know what I think?

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:23.942
I think you have an Expectane-assisted
pregnancy underway here in this house.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:27.279
Sorry, you're wrong.
- That hardly ever happens.

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:30.949
I'm on your side.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:34.160
If you guys are colouring
outside the lines, I can help.

01:04:36.914 --> 01:04:40.375
I'm speaking English.
There's nothing going on!

01:04:40.751 --> 01:04:43.628
How can I help you if you
leave me outside the loop?

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.506
Thanks for stopping by.

01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:54.097
Listen, could I use your
bathroom before I go?

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:59.311
It's down the hall. Make
a right. Pick up the seat.

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:19.247
Is he gone?
- No, he's in the can.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.507
Where are you?

01:05:30.343 --> 01:05:32.093
Come out, little mother.

01:05:50.696 --> 01:05:53.365
You think he believed us?
- I don't know.

01:05:54.408 --> 01:05:55.992
This guy's dangerous.

01:05:56.702 --> 01:05:58.119
Stay away from him.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:01.247
I will. Here.

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.799
I'm taking Diana out to dinner.
- Great.

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:15.345
Who is that?
- Aerosmith.

01:06:17.014 --> 01:06:18.556
You don't like their music?

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:22.435
Seven years, I tried everything.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.146
I couldn't get Angela pregnant.

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:26.773
One of these clowns

01:06:26.899 --> 01:06:28.650
one night, one shot

01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:30.652
mission accomplished.

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:36.449
Just ain't fair.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:37.951
Which one?

01:06:38.577 --> 01:06:39.661
I don't know.

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:43.289
Doesn't matter.

01:06:46.752 --> 01:06:48.336
You still love her.

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:51.006
No, it's good it's over.

01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:54.801
It's just this baby thing hat
got me a little, you know...

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:57.178
I'm having some feelings,
you know. That's all.

01:07:00.307 --> 01:07:02.851
I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Thanks.

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:07.313
You look good.
- Thank you.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.365
Hi, Angela.

01:07:21.495 --> 01:07:23.413
Is he home?
- Yes.

01:07:23.497 --> 01:07:24.831
Is he alone?
- Very.

01:07:25.332 --> 01:07:27.834
He will be very happy to see you.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

01:07:35.843 --> 01:07:37.677
I'm really very sorry.

01:07:37.928 --> 01:07:41.139
I'm just a bit confused
about this Strudelhund thing.

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:44.768
Excuse me. I believe this is yours

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.352
It is, thank you.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.065
Sorry. Thanks very much.
Got it. Safe and sound.

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:54.736
Yes, the Strudelhund thing.

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:56.529
No one's heard of it

01:07:56.614 --> 01:08:00.450
and then I looked up "Gelandensprung"
in my atlas and it wasn't there.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:05.997
You're right.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.418
There's no Gelandensprung.
There's no Strudelhunds.

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:13.630
I'm sorry I had to deceive you.

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:17.133
What's going on?

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:22.180
I want to know everything about me.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.808
Likewise.

01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:27.268
Can you keep an open mind?

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:29.437
I mean, really wide open?

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:31.272
I think so, yes.

01:08:32.316 --> 01:08:35.609
I have a most extraordinary condition.

01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:37.946
Thank you.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:40.865
You familiar with the
works of Edward Jenner?

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:44.035
The vaccination chap who
experimented on himself?

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:47.663
Probably you would never

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:51.417
experiment on yourself...
- No, I have actually. I mean

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:53.962
nothing so extraordinary
as Jenner, obviously but

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:59.466
I used my cryogenic technique to...

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:01.511
...to freeze one of my own eggs.

01:09:02.345 --> 01:09:03.388
You did?

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:05.140
Why?

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:10.145
I've always wanted children and I...

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.564
I never found the
person that I want to...

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:22.073
And I'm not getting younger, so I thought,
well, I'll just save one, just in case.

01:09:22.198 --> 01:09:25.285
It's in the dairy
section under "Junior".

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.036
What did you say?

01:09:28.288 --> 01:09:29.538
My egg

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:34.127
the freezer at the lab.
- You call it Junior?

01:09:34.752 --> 01:09:39.381
I know. Well, I couldn't put my own
name because everybody would know.

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:43.720
And you can't tell if it's a boy or
a girl, so I thought Junior would...

01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:47.473
I know. I've shocked you, haven't I?

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:53.520
I suppose it is a bit perverse
having your own eggs on display.

01:09:53.647 --> 01:09:57.650
But some people keep their tonsils,
their adenoids and appendixes and...

01:09:57.776 --> 01:10:01.237
Anyway, enough, sorry. I'm
embarrassing you. S, what...

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:04.449
I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Alex?

01:10:05.242 --> 01:10:06.451
What's the matter?

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.792
Not a roll, not a kick, not in two days.

01:10:15.419 --> 01:10:17.295
I know something's wrong.

01:10:18.005 --> 01:10:20.882
There's something wrong. Is
that what you want to hear?

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:25.011
All the drugs the father took
probably messed her up good.

01:10:25.137 --> 01:10:27.931
What drugs?
- I read up on Aerosmith.

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:30.058
Wasted for a decade.

01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:33.186
Coke, booze, pills.

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:36.689
What are you talking about?
- Which one is he?

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.696
Did you think it was someone in
the band? Is that what you thought?

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:46.616
That's what you said.

01:10:46.825 --> 01:10:50.662
No, that he was on tour with them. He's
not in the band. He's their trainer.

01:10:54.124 --> 01:10:55.083
She kicked.
- She kicked.

01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:58.503
You come with me right now.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.798
What?
- Where did you get Junior?

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:05.051
I told you.
- The truth! We're talking about my baby.

01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:06.594
Keep your voice down.

01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:10.556
I got it from Reddin's lab. So?

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:11.933
Well, it's Diana's.

01:11:12.643 --> 01:11:14.602
You mean, hers, personally?
- Yes!

01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:17.522
You were supposed to
get an anonymous egg.

01:11:18.315 --> 01:11:20.858
I tried. Everybody was all out.

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:23.528
Can you do something right?
- Wait, don't start with me.

01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:27.991
If you'd have stopped taking the
Expectane, this would not be an issue.

01:11:29.034 --> 01:11:31.119
What a horrible thing to say.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:32.829
Well, it's the truth.

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:35.164
Keeping it going was
your idea, not mine.

01:11:35.749 --> 01:11:38.626
Women have such convenient
memories when they're pregnant.

01:11:38.752 --> 01:11:40.128
Now take that back.

01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:45.675
That was a Freudian slip.
I know you're not a woman.

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:49.304
The part about I should have
ended it. Junior heard that.

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:52.390
Take it back.
- For crying out loud. I take it back.

01:11:52.516 --> 01:11:53.766
Like you mean it.

01:11:56.895 --> 01:11:59.063
Junior, I'm sorry. I take it back.

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:03.901
I just felt it kick.

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:08.531
Come. Feel it.
- No, I don't think so.

01:12:08.699 --> 01:12:11.034
Just feel it.

01:12:12.202 --> 01:12:15.830
Come. We need a healing experience.
- Give me a break!

01:12:15.956 --> 01:12:17.081
Just do it!

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:21.586
Here.

01:12:22.546 --> 01:12:23.588
Just watch.

01:12:24.256 --> 01:12:26.549
Be patient. Did you see that?

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.259
Right there.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.470
See his little foot go.
- Right there!

01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:34.932
It feels so good. Can you believe this?

01:12:37.269 --> 01:12:38.603
What's going on?

01:12:39.104 --> 01:12:40.313
What? Nothing.

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:43.691
You were touching him.

01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:48.738
No.

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:50.490
I can't deal with this.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.408
Can't deal with what?

01:12:52.993 --> 01:12:55.078
What are you? What
are you two, like a...

01:12:55.579 --> 01:12:57.497
What are you, a twosome?
- What?

01:12:57.623 --> 01:13:01.250
No.
- What is going on around here?

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:09.884
He's pregnant.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.931
I'm going to be a mama, too.

01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:31.823
You're sure it's the Expectane?

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:36.285
Yes. We compared what you gave us with
the sample we had on file in the lab.

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.996
Who do they think they're dealing with?

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.915
That's what really hurts.

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:44.544
We'll have to find out who she is.
- There's something else.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:46.838
What?
- The sample that you gave us

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:50.383
it was part Expectane
and part female hormones.

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:53.010
Estrogens and progesterone, to be exact.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:55.930
Wouldn't that be consistent
with an assisted pregnancy?

01:13:56.890 --> 01:14:01.144
Not a dosage of this size. This is
more like the amount you'd take, say

01:14:02.187 --> 01:14:04.439
preparing for a sex change operation.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:17.827
Oh, my God!

01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:26.252
You're doing some more charting.
We'll have to do the whole thing again.

01:14:30.048 --> 01:14:31.215
We're busy.

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:33.468
Please, I need to talk to you.

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:36.429
You need to apologize to me, don't you?

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:38.848
About last night, I'm sorry.

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:40.975
Please let me explain.

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:43.352
All right, then go on, explain.

01:14:45.647 --> 01:14:47.440
Guys, would you mind?

01:14:52.696 --> 01:14:53.571
What?

01:15:03.415 --> 01:15:04.832
I'm, pregnant.

01:15:07.377 --> 01:15:08.920
Good explanation.

01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:11.547
I really am pregnant.

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:16.469
What?

01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:20.681
I tested the Expectane on myself.

01:15:23.143 --> 01:15:26.562
We fertilized an egg and
implanted it into my abdomen.

01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:30.525
With drug and hormone supplements

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:32.443
I'm now seven months to term.

01:15:38.492 --> 01:15:39.825
Oh, my God!

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:47.041
There's more.

01:15:48.168 --> 01:15:49.210
More?

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:52.713
Larry was supposed to
find an anonymous egg

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:55.216
and he couldn't.

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:58.719
So he borrowed one
from your dairy section.

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:01.973
It's Junior.

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:03.933
My Junior?

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:08.437
Our Junior now.

01:16:10.774 --> 01:16:12.108
Our Junior?

01:16:14.152 --> 01:16:16.862
Please, don't be angry.
- Why should I be angry?

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:20.700
You lie to me, you steal from me.

01:16:21.868 --> 01:16:24.036
You engage an utterly

01:16:24.162 --> 01:16:26.163
immoral, selfish

01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:29.667
arrogant stunt without any
regard for my feelings whatsoever.

01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:32.336
What am I supposed to be, grateful?

01:16:32.796 --> 01:16:35.715
This is just so male!

01:16:35.799 --> 01:16:37.633
I'm sorry.
- Just don't come near me!

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:40.678
I never wanted to hurt you.
- What'd you think you were doing?

01:16:40.804 --> 01:16:44.140
You think men don't have enough?
You have to take this away as well?

01:16:46.351 --> 01:16:51.397
It's pitiful!
- Let me see the man who would be mom.

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:53.441
What are you talking about?

01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:57.028
The greatest scientific breakthrough
in the history of this University.

01:16:57.154 --> 01:17:01.073
Bravo. You know, we're in this
together. We have a contract.

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:02.742
And I quote:

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:06.287
"exploitation of results from
University-funded research

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:10.082
shall be at the sole discretion
of the University." Come on.

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:12.460
I've ordered some tests.
- Leave me alone.

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:15.588
He said to leave him alone.
- Escort Dr. Hesse to the ambulance.

01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:18.466
Can't allow it! He's in
a very delicate condition.

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:20.676
I'm really disappointed in you.

01:17:22.846 --> 01:17:25.890
You and your baby are
University property now.

01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:26.974
No, I'm not.

01:17:31.521 --> 01:17:34.106
My body, my choice

01:17:51.124 --> 01:17:52.083
Come on.

01:17:53.877 --> 01:17:54.752
Go!

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:11.435
Just easy. Breathe.

01:18:11.561 --> 01:18:13.062
That was really scary.

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:17.233
Relax. I must hide you.
- That ought to be easy.

01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:22.029
So what did Diana say?

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:24.448
She said I was selfish and arrogant.

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:28.285
That we'd taken away her dignity
and the sacred role of womanhood.

01:18:28.745 --> 01:18:30.246
Typical.

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:33.332
I can't tell you how many times
I've heard pregnant women complain:

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:35.960
"I just wish a man
could go through this."

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:40.256
You finally do it, and what do
you get? Attitude and insults.

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.800
Yeah, you're right.
- I'm telling you.

01:18:49.307 --> 01:18:51.892
Are you sure you'll be able
to go through with this?

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:54.937
I think so. I don't
have a lot of choice.

01:18:59.317 --> 01:19:00.276
Hello.
- Hello.

01:19:03.864 --> 01:19:05.281
It's nice. Hello.

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.534
How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:10.369
It's quite a place.

01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:13.330
Hi. - Hello- You must
be Mr. and Mrs. Hesse?

01:19:16.209 --> 01:19:17.835
Welcome.
- Welcome

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.545
to Casitas Madres.

01:19:19.963 --> 01:19:24.717
I think of Casitas Madres as a
health resort for expectant mothers.

01:19:25.343 --> 01:19:27.845
We want you to completely
relax while you're here.

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:32.183
That's really good news because
that's exactly what Alexandra needs

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:34.143
to just totally relax.

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:39.148
Would you have some lemonade?

01:19:39.232 --> 01:19:41.275
I'll have a little if it's okay.

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:45.488
I realize

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:48.282
that my appearance
might be a bit startling.

01:19:48.408 --> 01:19:51.827
It is sometimes difficult
for people to take.

01:19:52.537 --> 01:19:54.705
If I may speak to your concerns?

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:56.957
Yes, by all means.

01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:05.007
When I was a sportswoman on the East
German Olympic track-and-field team

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:08.594
they dispended anabolic
steroids as freely

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.847
as here in America
they dole out Gatorade.

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:14.600
They pushed it on them. I mean, just...

01:20:14.684 --> 01:20:17.728
Nothing was mentioned
of the side effects

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:21.315
that are now so obviously,
painfully apparent.

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:23.776
But I'm all woman.

01:20:23.902 --> 01:20:25.236
Believe you me.

01:20:26.029 --> 01:20:27.238
Of course.

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:31.158
I'm almost eight months pregnant, and
my Larry has to travel on business.

01:20:31.284 --> 01:20:34.203
I dread the thought of
leaving her helpless and alone.

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.330
That's why we're here.

01:20:36.456 --> 01:20:40.668
You've come to the right place.

01:20:43.755 --> 01:20:45.881
May I say something else?
- What?

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:50.553
You are beautiful.

01:20:51.763 --> 01:20:54.390
Thank you.
- Yes, you are.

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:57.768
And you'll love your room.
It's got a great big tub.

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:00.938
Big tub. That'll come in a handy.

01:21:02.816 --> 01:21:07.653
So tomorrow I catch the first flight
to Vancouver to meet the Lyndon guys.

01:21:07.779 --> 01:21:11.907
Shouldn't take more than three, four
days, tops. You okay, honey? Come on.

01:21:12.075 --> 01:21:14.201
Okay, right this way.

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:17.580
You have your temperature
control and your call button.

01:21:19.499 --> 01:21:21.250
It's a very nice room, huh?

01:21:24.004 --> 01:21:26.297
And extra blankets in the drawer.

01:21:26.923 --> 01:21:29.300
Here's your key.
- I want you to take good care of her.

01:21:29.801 --> 01:21:31.010
Of course we will.

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:34.179
No.
- All right. Bye.

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:40.019
Big.

01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:42.229
It's nice.

01:21:45.358 --> 01:21:49.111
You really think the baby will be born?

01:21:54.826 --> 01:21:56.660
I want to say, "Of course".

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.081
But there's no precedent for this.

01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:03.834
God knows what's going on in there.

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:08.255
But everything will be all right?
- It better be.

01:22:09.799 --> 01:22:11.383
It's my baby too, you know.

01:22:15.221 --> 01:22:16.555
Take it easy.

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.144
Thanks for everything.

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:01.934
It's Alex.

01:23:02.936 --> 01:23:04.812
In crease you're there, please pick up.

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:09.191
I really need to talk to you.

01:23:23.623 --> 01:23:25.791
Push, okay.

01:23:39.305 --> 01:23:41.557
A little more gentle with babies.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:50.107
I love you.

01:24:28.688 --> 01:24:29.938
I guess so.

01:24:52.045 --> 01:24:55.130
And remember, no names.
This isn't a test.

01:24:56.132 --> 01:24:56.965
Thanks.

01:24:57.634 --> 01:24:59.802
This should be very interesting.

01:25:00.845 --> 01:25:02.221
Let's see.

01:25:04.224 --> 01:25:05.557
She writes:

01:25:06.142 --> 01:25:11.438
"My biggest fear is that I'm not exactly
what you call a natural-born mother.

01:25:12.023 --> 01:25:14.108
How will I ever cope?"

01:25:14.859 --> 01:25:18.195
You know I think we have
to dispense with the myth

01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:21.448
that some are born with the
material instinct and others are not.

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:24.660
The little girl tending her
doll collection is no more a

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:29.081
natural-born mother than
the tomboy down the street.

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:32.751
There is no standard.
There are no rituals.

01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:04.241
Hello, Diana.

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:09.288
Very fetching.

01:26:11.624 --> 01:26:13.584
You might want to rethink the earnings.

01:26:15.086 --> 01:26:16.545
I'm glad you came.

01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:19.923
I started to wonder if I'd see you again.
- I needed some time to think.

01:26:20.925 --> 01:26:21.967
And?

01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:26.638
It's so unfair what you've done.
This is monumentally unfair.

01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:30.225
Will you forgive me?
- Don't be asking anything from me.

01:26:30.768 --> 01:26:33.520
I totally understand if you
never want to see me again.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:37.274
I'll take responsibility for the baby.
- Wait!

01:26:37.775 --> 01:26:41.153
Can we just get one thing straight
here? This is my baby, too.

01:26:41.237 --> 01:26:43.322
Don't you ever forget that!
- I won't.

01:26:44.157 --> 01:26:46.950
I'm the mother. You're the father.
- Yes.

01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:48.744
Is that clear?
- Yes.

01:26:48.828 --> 01:26:52.831
We'll have to find an intelligent
way of sharing the responsibilities.

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:54.750
Creating security and

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:56.585
a home life

01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:59.796
and a normal upbringing!

01:27:00.423 --> 01:27:02.174
All this is

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.927
very complicated.
- I know it is.

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:08.597
And I thought that I would be

01:27:10.183 --> 01:27:11.934
that I would be the...

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:16.980
You are.

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:23.237
I want us to do this together.

01:27:48.972 --> 01:27:50.472
Do you have a private room?

01:27:52.558 --> 01:27:53.767
Yes. Why?

01:27:55.228 --> 01:27:58.647
Call me old-fashioned, but I'm not having
a child with a man I never slept with.

01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:03.735
So, where is it?

01:28:11.577 --> 01:28:12.536
You coming?

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:01.209
I'd better get out of
here before anyone sees me.

01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:08.967
If everything is satisfactory,
please sign all copies where tagged.

01:29:09.093 --> 01:29:13.972
Once we have European approval,
the FDA will agree to testing.

01:29:14.057 --> 01:29:18.310
Leave it to us.
- Potential for your drug is remarkable.

01:29:18.978 --> 01:29:21.313
We'll be rich.
- Loaded.

01:29:23.274 --> 01:29:25.359
That's got a nice ring to it. Loaded.

01:29:45.296 --> 01:29:46.713
What's the matter?

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:50.509
Would you put this call
through to California?

01:29:50.593 --> 01:29:51.885
Sure, Dr. Arbogast.

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:55.597
Over there.

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:01.478
I should call the
doctor just to be sure.

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:03.772
I just need to lie down.

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:08.777
Damn it.

01:30:13.574 --> 01:30:18.370
Lyndon's coming in as partners.
This will push us through the FDA.

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:24.126
Are you okay?

01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:36.721
Set up an emergency
C-section for tonight.

01:30:36.806 --> 01:30:39.349
I want everybody out of the
building except you and Louise.

01:30:40.059 --> 01:30:42.477
You want to do an operation
with just the two of us?

01:30:42.562 --> 01:30:44.479
Just us. We're the whole team.

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:47.899
You can't do an emergency C-section
without an anaesthesiologist.

01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:49.693
We can handle it. Bye.

01:30:50.778 --> 01:30:52.195
She didn't come down for lunch.

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:55.282
You better call Dr. Talbot.
- Right.

01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:59.661
Hurry. I need you.

01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:01.788
I'm coming! Okay?

01:31:02.999 --> 01:31:05.876
I need the car. I need the keys.
- On the desk.

01:31:08.713 --> 01:31:11.047
You said to let you know if
something was going on here.

01:31:12.216 --> 01:31:15.427
Something's definitely going on.
They're sending everybody home.

01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:19.806
An emergency C-something.
Does that mean anything to you?

01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:22.809
Open the door, please.
- I want my Larry.

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:25.854
In the meantime, let's have
our doctor take a look at you.

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:30.650
There is nothing to worry about. I
think it's important that I see you.

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.278
I don't want to see you!

01:31:39.785 --> 01:31:41.786
Where is he?
- He? Who?

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:44.915
He, my, she, my wife!

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:47.167
She's upstairs. Thank God you're here.

01:31:47.293 --> 01:31:48.668
Pumpkin?

01:31:53.257 --> 01:31:56.927
Back! Excuse me!
- Thank God you're here.

01:31:57.553 --> 01:32:01.765
Honey, open up. It's Larry, open up.

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:08.980
I can take care of her.

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:15.570
Okay, okay. Just breathe.
- Oh, my God! Here it comes!

01:32:16.489 --> 01:32:18.615
I feel the baby. The baby!

01:32:19.408 --> 01:32:20.450
Oh, shit!

01:32:31.254 --> 01:32:32.462
Are you all right?

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:35.131
What the hell are you doing here?

01:32:35.258 --> 01:32:39.511
What am I doing here?
It's my baby, not yours!

01:32:40.179 --> 01:32:42.055
I put it in there.
- My egg.

01:32:42.181 --> 01:32:45.475
Your egg doesn't make you the mother.
- Shut up!

01:32:45.643 --> 01:32:47.352
Take me out of here!

01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:54.818
Do we have to bounce so much?
- Just a couple of miles like this.

01:32:54.944 --> 01:32:56.236
You okay, Alex?

01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:59.489
Feels like Junior kicked
a hole through something.

01:32:59.615 --> 01:33:02.033
I want to talk to Sneller.

01:33:02.451 --> 01:33:04.035
I want to die!
- Breathe.

01:33:05.496 --> 01:33:07.289
Stop blowing at me!
- Sorry.

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:09.666
I'm, about a half hour away.

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:12.210
Tell me what is going on.

01:33:12.336 --> 01:33:15.422
Someone from the University
has a bunch of media out front.

01:33:15.548 --> 01:33:18.967
Damn it! Can you get rid of them?
- I don' think so.

01:33:19.051 --> 01:33:21.845
What's this?
- I don't want to talk on the cellular.

01:33:22.013 --> 01:33:24.347
Just meet us outside!
- What's going on?

01:33:24.473 --> 01:33:25.932
Somebody tipped the press.

01:33:27.143 --> 01:33:29.894
What are we going to do?
- I don't know. I'm thinking.

01:33:36.485 --> 01:33:38.194
Better be big.

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:41.948
You pulled me away from dinner with
the University's largest benefactor.

01:33:42.074 --> 01:33:44.659
This is big, Edward,
literally and figuratively.

01:33:50.166 --> 01:33:53.376
Ladies an gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:55.086
Thank you for waiting.

01:33:56.756 --> 01:33:58.256
I'm Noah Banes

01:33:58.382 --> 01:34:01.885
director of Lufkin's
Biotechnology Research Center.

01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:05.096
This is Edward Sawyer,
president of Leland University.

01:34:06.932 --> 01:34:10.935
We are here to announce a momentous
breakthrough in medical science.

01:34:11.604 --> 01:34:13.688
Under my personal
guidance and supervision

01:34:13.773 --> 01:34:17.275
and with the aid of a
new wonder drug, Expectane

01:34:17.693 --> 01:34:21.655
Dr. Alexander Hesse of my
staff will be arriving shortly

01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:26.868
to give birth to a child he
has himself carried to term.

01:34:26.952 --> 01:34:29.162
Are you saying he's pregnant?
- Yes.

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:31.831
I am saying he's pregnant.

01:34:32.792 --> 01:34:34.918
I see him! There they are.
- What perfect timing.

01:34:35.044 --> 01:34:39.589
Here he is now, ladies and gentlemen. I
give you the world's first pregnant man.

01:34:50.935 --> 01:34:52.018
What is it?

01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:56.648
What are you doing here?
This is my building.

01:34:57.608 --> 01:35:00.068
Get out of here. I got
a medical emergency.

01:35:00.903 --> 01:35:02.404
Go on. Back off.

01:35:09.245 --> 01:35:10.578
Hi, mom.

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:11.955
What is this?

01:35:12.623 --> 01:35:13.998
It's just a woman.

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:16.835
That's my wife you're talking about.

01:35:16.961 --> 01:35:19.254
Hey, Ned. Thank you.
All right, okay, baby.

01:35:19.338 --> 01:35:20.630
Watch your step.

01:35:24.301 --> 01:35:26.010
Okay.
- Up here.

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:34.060
Up! Upsy-daisy.

01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:36.688
I've got you.

01:35:37.815 --> 01:35:40.066
Give me room. Ned,
let's get her in there.

01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:43.945
You told us there was a pregnant man.
- There is a pregnant man.

01:35:50.828 --> 01:35:53.246
He's having a baby, Edward. I swear it.

01:35:56.250 --> 01:35:57.584
You're fired.

01:36:02.548 --> 01:36:05.842
Why are we stopping on two?
- It's a surprise.

01:36:05.968 --> 01:36:09.012
I prepped the operating room upstairs.
- Good. You did good.

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:11.097
Thank God. Not yet.
- Are they here?

01:36:11.223 --> 01:36:12.390
Who's here?

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:17.020
Enough with the
huffing. We're all alone.

01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:20.273
Imagine a tranquil...

01:36:21.192 --> 01:36:22.484
Little birdies.

01:36:22.568 --> 01:36:24.444
In here!
- Cheep.

01:36:25.196 --> 01:36:28.364
Forget the birdies.
- Thank God! Are you okay?

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:30.784
Up out of there.
- Larry, what is this?

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:33.203
It's our patient.
- What's the matter with him?

01:36:33.913 --> 01:36:36.664
My best guess, his baby's
tangled in the large intestine.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.250
His baby?

01:36:39.376 --> 01:36:40.376
Oh, God!

01:36:41.086 --> 01:36:42.837
Is the room prepped?
- Yeah, it's prepped.

01:36:42.922 --> 01:36:45.173
Go on, Louise, open the door!

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:50.929
Relax. Just relax.

01:36:53.682 --> 01:36:54.849
Get him undressed!

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:00.855
Look at the belly on that guy!

01:37:04.527 --> 01:37:07.070
Please, let me do something!
- Look.

01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:09.697
This is dangerous

01:37:10.282 --> 01:37:12.116
both for Alex and the baby.

01:37:12.201 --> 01:37:14.661
I don't know what will happen.
There's nothing you can do.

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:18.456
Just go outside with Angela,
okay? Keep her company.

01:37:29.051 --> 01:37:30.093
What?

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.974
Not you? Not now? No.
- Yes.

01:37:36.892 --> 01:37:39.310
I'll get someone.
- I want Larry!

01:37:42.064 --> 01:37:43.398
Easy.

01:37:45.484 --> 01:37:46.776
Okay, look.

01:37:47.862 --> 01:37:52.240
Let's imagine a garden with
trees and birds cheeping. Cheep...

01:37:54.118 --> 01:37:55.827
Let's imagine drugs.

01:37:59.331 --> 01:38:01.916
What can I do?
- Have the baby for me.

01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:14.053
You feel that?

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.431
What?
- Feel that?

01:38:18.767 --> 01:38:20.143
The drugs are working.

01:38:20.853 --> 01:38:22.437
We gave you an epidural.

01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:26.149
You'll be awake through
this. It's safer that way.

01:38:27.026 --> 01:38:28.568
Just try and stay calm.

01:38:33.198 --> 01:38:35.950
Here we go.
- Just relax. Think about the baby. Okay?

01:38:36.035 --> 01:38:37.327
Blot.
- Blot.

01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:45.960
That's good. I'm not leaving you.

01:38:46.503 --> 01:38:49.047
Hold on. I'll check.
- Oh, God!

01:38:50.549 --> 01:38:51.883
This is hard.

01:38:54.011 --> 01:38:56.095
Where are you?
- I'm here.

01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:06.022
Do you think he's all right?

01:39:19.286 --> 01:39:22.288
It's tangled up in the intestines.
- Transverse colon's got it.

01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:25.667
There's a lot of fluid.
- It's clear.

01:39:27.878 --> 01:39:29.170
Suck it down there.

01:39:39.264 --> 01:39:42.767
Now push here. Push.
- Ready?

01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:02.870
That's your baby.

01:40:08.377 --> 01:40:12.505
It's a girl! Seven pounds, six
ounces. She's got her mother's looks.

01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:14.674
Father and daughter are doing fine.
- I have a girl?

01:40:15.217 --> 01:40:16.968
What?
- Another delivery.

01:40:17.052 --> 01:40:19.971
Go in there! Talk to me.

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:22.724
He's coming, honey.
- So soon?

01:40:23.392 --> 01:40:25.810
Louise, wheelchair!
- What?

01:40:26.603 --> 01:40:28.813
Why didn't you tell somebody?
- I wanted you.

01:40:28.939 --> 01:40:30.690
Well, you got me.

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.943
It hurts.
- It won't be long now.

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:38.740
Do you want Louise to call the father?

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:41.576
What's the point? He's long gone.

01:40:42.411 --> 01:40:44.454
Does he know it?
- Yes.

01:40:44.538 --> 01:40:50.293
He sent me a dozen roses and an
autographed picture with the band!

01:40:50.419 --> 01:40:52.003
Breathe, honey. Just breathe.

01:40:53.422 --> 01:40:55.381
Prepare number two.
- You want an epidural?

01:40:55.466 --> 01:40:59.302
You want natural childbirth?
- I want drugs!

01:41:16.028 --> 01:41:18.905
We've got a little
baby girl. Look at her.

01:41:21.658 --> 01:41:23.034
You did it.

01:41:24.411 --> 01:41:25.870
Isn't she gorgeous?

01:41:28.791 --> 01:41:32.502
Daddy love you.
- I can't believe you did it.

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:39.550
Hello, little one.

01:41:41.595 --> 01:41:44.013
She's beautiful.

01:41:50.896 --> 01:41:52.647
I'm so proud of you.

01:41:57.402 --> 01:41:58.903
I'm your mum.

01:42:02.658 --> 01:42:04.325
Just a little bit more.

01:42:09.206 --> 01:42:10.623
It's a boy!

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:16.379
Is he okay?
- Yeah, ten fingers. Ten toes.

01:42:20.384 --> 01:42:21.801
That's your mommy.

01:42:34.398 --> 01:42:35.815
Hello, beauty.

01:42:37.693 --> 01:42:39.360
I'm your mama.

01:42:40.279 --> 01:42:42.864
Yes, it's your mama.
- And I'm your...

01:42:55.919 --> 01:42:58.171
Could we give it another chance?

01:43:02.467 --> 01:43:03.843
Yes.

01:43:11.435 --> 01:43:13.060
I'm your dad.

01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:18.774
You're my boy.

01:43:25.324 --> 01:43:26.991
What should we call her?

01:43:31.705 --> 01:43:33.039
Junior.

01:43:34.958 --> 01:43:38.377
Junior? Junior.

01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:04.862
He's a big boy.

01:44:04.988 --> 01:44:07.740
You're supposed to eat with
your hands, not with your feet.

01:44:08.825 --> 01:44:10.618
That's a baby.
- There you go.

01:44:11.286 --> 01:44:14.121
Those kids need something to drink.
- Don't lift anything.

01:44:14.289 --> 01:44:16.207
I'm not lifting. I'm dragging it.
- Let me get it.

01:44:16.833 --> 01:44:18.459
Let me do it.
- How are you feeling?

01:44:18.627 --> 01:44:19.585
Fine.

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:24.257
Though I might need to pee again.
- I don't miss that part.

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:26.050
Me, neither.

01:44:27.094 --> 01:44:30.263
You have to have another, Angela.
Jake needs a little brother or sister.

01:44:31.014 --> 01:44:35.101
Sure, I'd like to, but I don't
know if I can go through that again.

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:37.895
It doesn't necessarily have to be you.

01:44:44.778 --> 01:44:46.112
No!

01:44:47.406 --> 01:44:50.324
It is the most wonderful experience.
