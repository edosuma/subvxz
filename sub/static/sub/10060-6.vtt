- but you're gonna do
that thing tonight, right?
- Yes.

06:51.083 --> 06:52.291

someone's wife."

06:52.291 --> 06:54.625

- Right.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.333

I am someone's wife.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.625

No, no, no, seriously,
Charlie, you're a POS.

07:05.417 --> 07:07.542
And, yeah, I might've
been an asshole to you

You beat the shit
out of me.

07:17.542 --> 07:20.750
All right.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.625
Well, I apologize
for that,

07:22.625 --> 07:25.625
but I was kind of
going through a pretty
fucked-up time.

07:25.625 --> 07:28.250
My dad-- my dad died.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.959
What?

07:30.959 --> 07:35.500
He killed himself, actually.
He hung himself.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.750
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

07:37.750 --> 07:41.125
I didn't know that.
I'm so sorry.

07:41.125 --> 07:44.542
No, you know,
I'm sorry.

07:44.542 --> 07:46.875
That's all I can really
say is "I'm sorry."

07:49.041 --> 07:50.792
But, listen, do you
want to come with--

07:50.792 --> 07:53.417
just come with me
to this party.

07:53.417 --> 07:57.250
It'll be harmless.
We'll catch up.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.041
- Please.
- Okay.

07:59.041 --> 08:01.083
Yeah?

08:01.083 --> 08:03.583
Okay.
All right, good.
I'm happy.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.875
We got to get you
a dress, though.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.792
All right.

08:07.792 --> 08:09.375
- Marnie.
- Yeah?

08:09.375 --> 08:11.083
Try these on.
Try those on.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.834
Oh, my God, I can't
try all these on.

08:12.834 --> 08:14.166
Yes, you can.
I'm just giving
you options,

08:14.166 --> 08:15.375
baby, you know

08:15.375 --> 08:16.875
I'm just

08:16.875 --> 08:18.208

more and more options.

08:18.208 --> 08:20.333
- Okay.
- ( chuckles )

08:20.333 --> 08:21.750
Hey.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.542
Do you have a bathroom
I can use?

08:23.542 --> 08:25.959
I'm gonna buy stuff.
I just need to use
the bathroom.

08:25.959 --> 08:27.542
Oh, yeah, there's
a burrito place next door.

08:27.542 --> 08:28.917
You just have to, like,
buy a soda or something.

08:28.917 --> 08:30.375
Oh, okay.

08:30.375 --> 08:32.792
Uh, Marnie,
I'll be right back!

08:32.792 --> 08:34.417
Okay.

08:39.958 --> 08:41.457
That dress looks
really pretty on you.

08:41.457 --> 08:42.792
Oh, thank you so much.

08:42.792 --> 08:45.417
I feel like a Bob Mackie
Barbie doll.

08:45.417 --> 08:46.917
Oh, no,
that's 100% the look.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.250
That's what people
come in here wanting.

08:49.250 --> 08:51.333
That guy's
my ex-boyfriend.

08:51.333 --> 08:54.208
I haven't seen him
in literally almost
two years

08:54.208 --> 08:57.959
until just now.
Like, just before
right now.

08:57.959 --> 09:01.417
He left without
any explanation,
and now I'm married

09:01.417 --> 09:04.250
to, like, an entirely
different man who's also
my musical partner.

09:04.250 --> 09:07.250
- Cool.
- I know you might
be wondering, like,

09:07.250 --> 09:08.625
how does someone
fit that much action

09:08.625 --> 09:10.041
into such a short
amount of time.

09:10.041 --> 09:13.583
Yes, I am only 25
and a half years old...

09:13.583 --> 09:15.166
No, that seems right.

09:15.166 --> 09:17.041
...but somehow
I've managed to live
so much.

09:17.041 --> 09:19.583
I feel like I'm looking
out the eyes of a woman

09:19.583 --> 09:23.500
at hands that have touched
and have been touched.

09:23.500 --> 09:24.792
Does that make any sense?

09:24.792 --> 09:26.375
Whoa, oh.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.166
- Hey, oh, my God.
- Yeah?

09:28.166 --> 09:29.542
- You look great.
- Are you sure?

09:29.542 --> 09:31.208
- That's perfect, yeah.
- I don't know.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.208
No, you look awesome.
All right, let's do this.

09:33.208 --> 09:35.667
- Yeah? How much is it?
- What? I need heels
and stuff like that.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.458
Doesn't matter.
No, no, no, you're good.

09:37.458 --> 09:39.959
- What are you doing?
- They're waiting on us!

09:50.375 --> 09:52.500
( laughing )

09:52.500 --> 09:55.166
( chatting )

10:05.208 --> 10:07.083
What are we
doing here?

10:07.083 --> 10:08.834
I just have a friend
who asked me to swing by.

10:08.834 --> 10:11.542
What kind of friend?
Everyone here is
150 years old.

10:11.542 --> 10:13.500
Just wait here
a second, okay?

10:13.500 --> 10:15.875
- No way.
- Just wait one second.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.500
No fucking way.
I'm not standing here
alone in this dress.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.625
All right.
Suit yourself, come on.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.208
- Brian, hello.
- Hello, sir.

10:29.208 --> 10:31.125
Brian, this is
my fiancée, Masha.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.333
Masha, it's a pleasure.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.708
Uh, will you ladies
excuse us for just a moment?

10:35.708 --> 10:37.417
Marnie:
Of course, Brian.

10:39.792 --> 10:42.583
( Eastern European accent )
He buying cocaine for us
to have party.

10:42.583 --> 10:45.041
Yeah, I can see that.

10:46.542 --> 10:49.000
Out of curiosity,
how old are you?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.458
25 and half.

10:51.458 --> 10:53.917
Makes sense.

10:53.917 --> 10:57.542
Okay, uh, I'm just
gonna use the bathroom
really quick, okay?

11:01.500 --> 11:03.250
What's your name,
darling?

11:04.667 --> 11:08.333
I'm Magita.
Magita Perez.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.208
Well, Magita,
what would you say

11:10.208 --> 11:13.125
if I asked you
to join Masha and me
later upstairs?

11:13.125 --> 11:14.792
Masha?

11:16.959 --> 11:18.708
Me?

11:18.708 --> 11:21.333
Is Brian
the person I should
talk to negotiate that?

11:21.333 --> 11:25.208
No, no,
I'll handle it.

11:25.208 --> 11:29.959
I'm, uh, 300 cash,
up front.

11:34.875 --> 11:38.250
Room 1206.
We'll be there by 10:30.

11:38.250 --> 11:41.583
Sounds good, except
there's a $200 fee

11:41.583 --> 11:43.250
if I'm going above
the tenth floor.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.875
I'm afraid of heights.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.875
And a hundred-dollar
gown rental fee.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.959
Unless you want me
to wear my jeans.

11:56.375 --> 11:58.458

11:58.458 --> 12:00.625

to it.

Okay?
Go back to Park Slope.

Your mom's not
gonna be mad at you,

and your jewelry now.

Look, seriously,
back the fuck off, okay?
Back the fuck-- oh, shit.

- Here, here, here, here.

17:37.750 --> 17:41.083
- Your rings. Come on.
- Okay, here's my wedding ring
and my engagement ring.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.792
- Just-- here, here.
- He didn't ask for
my fucking earrings.

17:42.792 --> 17:44.291
Just give them to him.
He's gonna want them.

17:44.291 --> 17:45.917
- Marnie: Okay, okay, okay.
- Hello?!

Okay.

Fuck, dude.
Are you...

17:56.792 --> 18:00.583
I didn't know people get,
like, robbed anymore.

18:04.625 --> 18:08.000
- You live here?
- I do.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.500
There's a garbage bag
on the window.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.333
Yeah, well,
I sleep late.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.041
So, get curtains.

18:15.041 --> 18:16.750
Actually, you know what?
Never mind.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.000
I'm not here
to change you.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.458

anybody anymore.

do about you?

18:34.750 --> 18:36.500

18:41.500 --> 18:45.417
What if we...

18:45.417 --> 18:47.208
ran away?

18:51.375 --> 18:54.041
I'm serious.

18:54.041 --> 18:55.417
What if, like,
the last few years

18:55.417 --> 18:57.708
were just a bad dream
and we ran away?

19:00.708 --> 19:03.041
And opened up
a general store.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.708
Somewhere where they
need a general store.

19:08.417 --> 19:10.625
I got cash,
I got a bike.

19:10.625 --> 19:13.041
We can go
wherever we wanted.

19:14.959 --> 19:17.041
Wouldn't have
to tell anybody if we
didn't feel like it.

19:19.041 --> 19:22.166
- I don't need
any of my stuff.
- No.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.792
I don't, I really...

19:24.792 --> 19:26.625
don't need
any of my stuff.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.708
I hate
all of my stuff.

19:30.959 --> 19:33.458
I'm serious.
As soon as the sun
comes up, let's go.

19:36.250 --> 19:40.625
But what about
all of the time, hmm?

19:40.625 --> 19:43.125
Doesn't have to bother us
if we don't let it.

20:08.417 --> 20:11.500
( moans )

20:11.500 --> 20:14.000
Oh, okay.

20:36.291 --> 20:39.667
I'm cold.
I need a shower.

20:39.667 --> 20:42.583
The bathroom's
in the hall.

20:42.583 --> 20:44.417
Cool.

20:57.250 --> 21:00.000
( door opens )

21:01.875 --> 21:03.291
Hey.

21:04.917 --> 21:06.792
Hi.

21:09.041 --> 21:10.708
Late night?

21:12.083 --> 21:13.667
Yeah, kinda.

21:13.667 --> 21:17.375
Why is everybody
such a fucking
disappointment?

21:20.750 --> 21:22.166
Guy problems?

21:22.166 --> 21:25.708
Yeah, if you call
a hot dyke with
a strap-on

21:25.708 --> 21:27.250
and a Mets cap a guy.

21:27.250 --> 21:31.000
She left me off
on the side of the BQE.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.500
Kicked me off
her motorcycle.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.375
Oh, my God.
That is awful.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.125
- Yeah.
- How did you get home?

21:36.125 --> 21:38.041
I fucking walked.

21:38.041 --> 21:39.542
It's not even her,
you know?

21:39.542 --> 21:40.917
She was--
she was fine.

21:40.917 --> 21:43.166
She was as much as
an asshole as anyone.

21:43.166 --> 21:46.000
I just-- I can't
have one more fantasy
busted open.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.375
I swear to God,
I can't fucking take it.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.291
( sighs )

21:51.291 --> 21:52.500
That's my towel.

21:54.166 --> 21:56.375
I'm so sorry.

21:56.375 --> 21:58.125
I did not know that.

21:58.125 --> 22:02.041
Um... oh.
Sorry.

22:09.583 --> 22:11.041
You have nice tits.

22:11.041 --> 22:13.708
Thank you.

22:17.625 --> 22:21.125
You know, that shower
actually has really good
water pressure.

22:45.375 --> 22:47.208
( clatters )

22:52.583 --> 22:54.250
Charlie?

22:56.291 --> 22:58.166
- Charlie!
- Yeah?

22:58.166 --> 23:00.458
What the fuck
is this needle?

23:03.083 --> 23:04.834
Oh.

23:04.834 --> 23:07.333
I'm diabetic.

23:07.333 --> 23:08.792
Yeah.

23:12.542 --> 23:15.417
( music playing )

24:00.166 --> 24:02.166
( soft laugh )

24:03.667 --> 24:06.250
Where are your
fucking shoes, Marnie?

24:06.250 --> 24:08.834
Whose dress is that?
Where are your fucking rings?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.875
I'm sorry.

24:20.291 --> 24:22.083
For what?

24:26.375 --> 24:28.542
I don't want
to be married to you.

24:35.625 --> 24:37.542
It's not even your fault.

24:37.542 --> 24:40.542
I mean, yeah, you're--
you're an asshole,

24:40.542 --> 24:43.041
but it's really
not your fault.

24:43.041 --> 24:47.667
I just-- I knew I shouldn't
have married you.

24:47.667 --> 24:50.750
I just didn't want to give up
on yet another dream.

24:52.792 --> 24:55.250
What are you
talking about?

24:55.250 --> 24:58.458
I just don't know
who I am right now.

24:58.458 --> 25:00.542
I'm like a ghost
of myself.

25:00.542 --> 25:04.875
I don't know
what I'm doing here
or anywhere else.

25:06.708 --> 25:09.708
But I don't want
to be married to you.

25:13.625 --> 25:15.500
Okay.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.166
- Okay?
- Yeah.

25:18.166 --> 25:21.375
Oh, thank you.

25:21.375 --> 25:24.166
You should go and be
on your own, Marn.

25:24.166 --> 25:25.917
You know?
Do what you have to do.

25:25.917 --> 25:29.250
Yeah, I think
that's what I need.

25:31.458 --> 25:33.083
But, trust me, Marnie,

25:33.083 --> 25:37.750
it is, like, not gonna
work out so great.

25:40.750 --> 25:42.291
It's not?

25:42.291 --> 25:46.250
I mean, probably

25:46.250 --> 25:49.625
you're gonna
get... murdered.

25:49.625 --> 25:54.333
I mean, that is
how little of a sense
of the world that you have.

25:54.333 --> 25:56.458
You're just--
you're just--
you're just--

25:56.458 --> 25:58.333
you're gonna
get murdered one day.

25:58.333 --> 26:00.625
You're gonna get murdered.
I'm sorry.

26:00.625 --> 26:04.208
Yeah, well...

26:04.208 --> 26:07.041
you know, Desi,
maybe you're right.

26:07.041 --> 26:08.417
Maybe I do get murdered.

26:08.417 --> 26:10.500
Oh.

26:13.291 --> 26:15.458
( sobbing )
Oh, my God.

26:18.125 --> 26:19.959
( babbling )

26:22.125 --> 26:23.750
You know
I can't hear you.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.125
Try to remember

26:27.125 --> 26:30.959
the hope
of the beginning,
you know?

26:30.959 --> 26:32.834
- "The hope
of the beginning"?
- Yeah.

26:32.834 --> 26:34.500
You mean when you
had a girlfriend

26:34.500 --> 26:36.667
and I saw you,
like, twice a week

26:36.667 --> 26:39.417
and half the times we fucked
you covered my face
with a pillow

26:39.417 --> 26:41.375
because you couldn't
handle the guilt?

26:41.375 --> 26:43.625
- Do you remember that?
- Yeah, okay.

26:43.625 --> 26:48.125
Jesus Christ,
I have some, like,
serious shit to work out.

26:48.125 --> 26:51.375
So do you.
I'm not sure you're
capable of it, but...

26:51.375 --> 26:54.375
that's not
my problem anymore.

26:57.166 --> 27:00.166
Do you want me
to get my stuff?

27:00.166 --> 27:04.834
Uh, no, that's fine.
