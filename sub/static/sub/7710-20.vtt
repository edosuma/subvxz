WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:01.802
Kevin Malone, you're next.

00:01.835 --> 00:04.805
Spit that out.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.408
Spit--okay, come on.
Let's go.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.515
You look cute today, Dwight.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.317
Thanks, girl.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.621
So, yesterday, Dwight found
half a joint

00:20.654 --> 00:21.689
in the parking lot.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.125
Which is unfortunate,
because, as it turns out,

00:24.158 --> 00:25.826
Dwight finding drugs
is more dangerous

00:25.859 --> 00:28.096
than most people
using drugs.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.830
Let's go over
some of the symptoms

00:29.863 --> 00:33.067
of marijuana use, shall we?

00:33.101 --> 00:35.403
You tell me
who this sounds like.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.239
Slow moving.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.540
Inattentive.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.542
Dull.

00:41.575 --> 00:44.612
Constantly snacking.

00:44.645 --> 00:48.048
Shows a lack of motivation.

00:50.884 --> 00:51.785
Hey.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.822
I like the people
I work with generally.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.690
With four exceptions.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.093
But someone
committed a crime.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.728
And I did not become
a Lackawanna County

01:00.761 --> 01:04.098
Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy
to make friends.

01:04.132 --> 01:06.100
And by the way,
I haven't.

01:39.200 --> 01:43.204
I enjoy the tangy zip
of Miracle Whip.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.574
Jim does
the best impressions.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.142
Sometimes he'll look up at me
from his desk

01:48.176 --> 01:50.244
and he'll just
be someone else.

01:50.278 --> 01:53.214
Like, he'll go, um...

01:58.652 --> 02:00.721
That was supposed
to be Phyllis.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.323
I can't do it
as good as he can.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.825
And the guys are saying,
"Chug chug chug."

02:04.858 --> 02:06.860
But I'm so small
and all I'd eaten that day

02:06.894 --> 02:08.462
was one of those
Auntie M pretzels

02:08.496 --> 02:09.830
from the food court.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.865
So I said, "Is it okay
if I sip it?"

02:11.899 --> 02:12.866
And they said no.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.268
But Ryan seemed cool
either way.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.703
Stop!

02:15.736 --> 02:18.839
This is not Kelly Kapur
story hour.

02:18.872 --> 02:22.776
Illegal drugs were consumed
on company property, okay?

02:22.810 --> 02:24.912
Your ass is on the line,
Mister!

02:24.945 --> 02:26.780
My ass is on the line.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.316
Now, I'm gonna ask you again.

02:28.349 --> 02:31.719
What time did you
go home last night?

02:31.752 --> 02:33.254
6:00.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.363
I didn't know that you were
at a party Saturday night.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.865
I go to a lot
of parties.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.235
Okay, I'm gonna need
to search your car.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.569
Give me your keys.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.703
I am not giving you
my keys.

02:49.737 --> 02:50.904
Don't make me
do this the hard way.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.240
What's the hard way?

02:52.273 --> 02:54.575
I go down
to the police station

02:54.608 --> 02:55.709
on my lunch break.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.211
I tell a police officer...

02:57.245 --> 02:58.779
I know several.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.748
What I suspect
you may have in your car.

03:00.781 --> 03:01.815
He requests a hearing
from a judge

03:01.849 --> 03:03.351
and obtains
a search warrant.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.385
Once he has said warrant,

03:04.418 --> 03:07.688
he will drive over here
and make you give him

03:07.721 --> 03:08.889
the keys to your car.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.891
And you will
have to obey him.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.793
Yeah, let's do it
that way.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.295
Ryan, is he bugging you?

03:14.328 --> 03:15.729
Dwight, dude,

03:15.763 --> 03:17.731
you gotta take
a chill pill, man.

03:17.765 --> 03:21.502
It was one joint
in the parking lot, you know?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.804
You're totally harshing
the office mellow.

03:23.837 --> 03:24.805
I can't stop
this investigation.

03:24.838 --> 03:25.806
It is my job.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.508
Whoa, you are
a volunteer.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.809
I volunteered
for this job.

03:28.842 --> 03:29.977
And that's not the same.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.379
It is my duty...
Volunteer duty.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.746
to investigate
the crime scene.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.582
I have six more
interviews to go.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.684
And then I will reveal
what I know.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.452
Narc!

03:39.720 --> 03:41.422
If you are attempting
to compliment me,

03:41.455 --> 03:42.256
you have done
a very good job.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.757
I wasn't attempting
to compliment you.

03:43.791 --> 03:44.758
Well, you have.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.360
Because being a narc is one of
the hardest jobs

03:46.394 --> 03:47.728
that you can have.
Okay.

03:47.761 --> 03:48.729
And I am very proud
of being a narc.

03:48.762 --> 03:49.730
Why don't you just cool it?

03:49.763 --> 03:51.031
Cool it, Dwight, please?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.032
God.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.734
Dude, where's my office?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.703
I totally lost it!

03:55.736 --> 03:56.804
'Cause I was half-baked!

03:56.837 --> 04:00.508
Smoking doobies!
Doobie Brothers.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.477
I was smoking doobies
with my brothers.

04:03.511 --> 04:07.481
Peace out!
Seacrest.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.049
Well, your office
is behind you.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.318
Thanks.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.652
Mmmunchies.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.886
Who wants some munchies?

04:12.920 --> 04:16.690
I don't think Michael's
ever done drugs.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.427
I don't know if anyone's
ever offered him any.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.929
Oscar visited Mexico
when he was five

04:21.962 --> 04:24.532
to attend his
great grandmother's funeral.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.866
What does that mean
to a United States

04:25.899 --> 04:27.401
law enforcement officer?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.604
He's a potential drug mule.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.840
Have you ever taken any
illegal drugs?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.074
No, I have not.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.544
Do you think it's possible
that maybe

04:36.577 --> 04:38.579
you could have had
some drugs in your system

04:38.612 --> 04:40.013
without you
knowing about it?

04:40.047 --> 04:42.049
What are you implying?

04:42.082 --> 04:45.786
Have you ever...

04:45.819 --> 04:48.856
pooped a balloon?

04:51.392 --> 04:53.694
Okay, I'm done with this.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.670
He sure left
in a hurry.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.037
I don't wanna blow this.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.873
This is what all
good law enforcement officers

05:05.906 --> 05:07.775
dream of.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.644
The chance to solve
an actual crime.

05:10.678 --> 05:13.747
Do you know
what this is?

05:13.781 --> 05:15.583
Yes, it's marijuana.

05:15.616 --> 05:16.750
How do you know that?

05:16.784 --> 05:19.487
It's labeled.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.489
Dammit.

05:22.656 --> 05:26.660
That is Northern Lights
Cannabis Indica.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.830
No.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.632
It's marijuana.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.566
I'm just saying
that you can't be sure

05:32.600 --> 05:33.767
that it wasn't you.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.603
That's ridiculous.
Of course it wasn't me.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.372
Marijuana
is a memory loss drug.

05:38.406 --> 05:39.573
So maybe you just
don't remember.

05:39.607 --> 05:40.574
I would remember.

05:40.608 --> 05:41.642
Well, how could you

05:41.675 --> 05:42.643
of it just
erased your memory?

05:42.676 --> 05:43.744
That's not how it works.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.979
Now, how do you know
how it works?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.715
Knock it off, okay?
I am interviewing you.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.617
No, you said that
I'd be conducting the interview

05:49.650 --> 05:50.918
when I walked in here.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.986
Now, exactly how much pot
did you smoke?

05:55.122 --> 05:57.825
So, Pam told me you do
a great Stanley impression.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.959
I'd love to hear it.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.995
Oh, um...

06:02.029 --> 06:04.465
Why do you keep CC'ing me
on things

06:04.498 --> 06:06.667
that have nothing
to do with me?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.602
Why do you...

06:08.636 --> 06:09.703
Oh.

06:09.737 --> 06:10.771
Is that supposed to be me?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.506
Oh, hey, Stanley.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.707
I was just doing
an impression.

06:13.741 --> 06:17.611
I do not think
that is funny.

06:17.645 --> 06:20.414
He does everyone
in the office.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.715
Hmm.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.689
I do not think
that is funny.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.890
Jinx.
Buy me a coke.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.659
No no no!
No talking.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.697
Jim is not allowed to talk

06:36.730 --> 06:38.666
until after
he buys me a coke.

06:38.699 --> 06:39.833
Those are the rules
of jinx.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.869
And they are
unflinchingly rigid.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.644
Sold out!

06:50.678 --> 06:53.581
That has never happened
in the history of jinx!

06:55.015 --> 06:56.650
Sorry, that's not
my problem.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.528
I know you're innocent.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.562
But I can't look like
I'm treating you

07:08.596 --> 07:10.598
any differently.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.933
I understand.

07:12.966 --> 07:16.136
Where were you yesterday
after work?

07:16.169 --> 07:18.171
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.239
Who's he calling?

07:19.272 --> 07:20.541
Rattin' somebody out.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.576
Narc.
Narc!

07:22.610 --> 07:23.577
Kevin.

07:23.611 --> 07:24.912
That is so good, Michael.

07:24.945 --> 07:25.913
Remember the narc bit?

07:27.848 --> 07:28.816
I will let them know.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.217
Uh-oh.
Who's in trouble?

07:30.250 --> 07:31.652
Attention, everyone!

07:31.685 --> 07:33.621
Drug testers are coming
in a couple hours

07:33.654 --> 07:36.089
to test everyone's urine.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.258
Wha...
What?

07:38.291 --> 07:39.560
What are you talking about?
Company policy.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.529
If drugs are found
on the premises,

07:41.562 --> 07:43.130
there is automatic
drug testing

07:43.163 --> 07:45.533
conducted within 24 hours.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.234
Is that true, Toby?

07:47.267 --> 07:49.202
Uh, when you sign
your job application

07:49.236 --> 07:51.572
you agree to comply
with random drug testing.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.177
Two nights ago I went
to an Alicia Keys concert

07:57.210 --> 07:58.946
at Montage Mountain
Performing Arts Center.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.681
I scored these
great aisle seats.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.516
Anyway,
after the opening act,

08:02.550 --> 08:04.217
this beautiful girl
sits down next to me.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.186
And I never get to meet girls
with lip rings.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.088
And she had one.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.790
I don't know exactly
how this happened,

08:09.823 --> 08:12.092
but one of her friends
started passing around

08:12.125 --> 08:13.527
some stuff.

08:13.561 --> 08:14.862
And they said that it
was clove cigarettes.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.964
And I'm sure that
it was clove cigarettes.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.166
Everybody in the aisle
was doing it.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.234
Okay, attention,
everyone.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.203
The drug testing
has been cancelled.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.738
Instead, I will be
going around

08:24.772 --> 08:27.841
to each of you and doing
a visual inspection.

08:27.875 --> 08:28.842
No, you can't do that.

08:28.876 --> 08:29.843
I can do that.

08:29.877 --> 08:30.878
It is my office.

08:30.911 --> 08:31.879
No, you cannot.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.614
It has to be official.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.649
And it has to be urine.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.255
Uh...all right.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.800
Kevin, what prescription drugs
are you taking

08:52.833 --> 08:53.801
besides Rogaine?

08:53.834 --> 08:56.269
I'm not taking Rogaine.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.938
Angela, what about you?

08:57.971 --> 09:00.173
I don't take
any prescription drugs.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.043
You're not...on anything?

09:06.213 --> 09:07.247
Good.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.252
So, the first time
we went out to dinner,

09:12.285 --> 09:14.154
it was like,
whatever, fine.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.223
But I was so nervous.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.291
So this time,
I want it to be special.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.693
So I bought a new dress!

09:19.727 --> 09:21.161
One of those kinds
that's kind of low cut

09:21.194 --> 09:22.195
at the top
to show some things

09:22.229 --> 09:23.797
but not everything.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.866
I mean, not everything, Jim.
I promise.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.735
Hey, you guys.
What's going on?

09:27.768 --> 09:30.303
Oh, we're just having
the best conversation.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.239
Oh, okay--well,
Michael wants to see everyone

09:32.272 --> 09:33.941
in the conference room.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.610
But you know what?
We have a few minutes.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.112
So you guys should definitely
finish up your conversation.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.147
Cool, thanks.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.118
So I was looking so hot...

09:45.152 --> 09:48.255
It has come
to my attention

09:48.288 --> 09:53.260
that some people here
think the use of drugs

09:53.293 --> 09:55.328
is something
to laugh about.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.296
We don't feel that way.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.264
No, not at all.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.298
You were the one
joking around

09:58.331 --> 09:59.299
calling Dwight a narc.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.635
No.
Uh, no.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.204
That was a test.
I was testing you.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.673
And you all failed.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.942
Miserably.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.277
When I said
that Dwight was a narc,

10:10.310 --> 10:11.679
how many of you
defended him?

10:11.712 --> 10:13.313
How many of you said,
"Hey, you know what?

10:13.346 --> 10:14.715
"He's right.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.350
"What he's doing
is protecting this office

10:17.384 --> 10:18.652
from the evils of drugs"?

10:18.686 --> 10:19.953
Thank you, Michael.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.055
I am ridiculously
anti-drug.

10:22.089 --> 10:25.659
I am so anti-drug that I am
above suspicion

10:25.693 --> 10:27.995
in any way
that involved suspicion...

10:28.028 --> 10:30.163
or testing of any kind.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.833
Drugs ruin lives, people.

10:32.866 --> 10:36.069
Drugs destroy careers.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.370
Take Cheech and Chong.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.173
Everybody knows that
Cheech and Chong are funny.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.009
But just imagine
how funny they would be

10:42.042 --> 10:44.978
if they didn't smoke pot.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.279
I want everybody
to take a look to their left.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.084
Now I want everybody
to take a look to their right.

10:51.118 --> 10:54.755
One of those people
will be dead

10:54.788 --> 10:58.158
from drug use at some point
in their lives.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.961
This year, more people

11:00.994 --> 11:03.797
will use cocaine
than will read a book

11:03.831 --> 11:04.865
to their children.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.266
Where did you
get these facts?

11:06.299 --> 11:07.735
Are these facts
scaring you?

11:07.768 --> 11:08.769
Or are they not?

11:08.802 --> 11:09.703
They are not.

11:09.737 --> 11:13.373
Do you think
that smoking drugs is cool?

11:13.406 --> 11:16.409
Do you think
that doing alcohol is cool?

11:16.443 --> 11:17.310
No, I don't.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.012
I have a glass of red wine
with dinner

11:19.046 --> 11:21.281
about once a week
for the antioxidants.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.282
Okay, enough.
Enough.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.283
Enough!

11:23.316 --> 11:29.122
I have written down a list
of illegal drugs.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.123
Take a gander.

11:30.157 --> 11:33.093
How many of these
are you familiar with?

11:33.126 --> 11:35.095
Hookah is not
an illegal drug, Michael.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.229
Yes, it is.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.865
No, it's not.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.867
It's a type of pipe.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.036
You can fill it with tobacco,
often mixed with fruit, or...

11:43.070 --> 11:44.772
Okay, you know what, Toby?

11:44.805 --> 11:46.073
Pam, could you
take this down?

11:46.106 --> 11:48.809
In addition to Toby's urine
being tested,

11:48.842 --> 11:50.778
I would like to test
his blood and his hair.

11:50.811 --> 11:51.879
You can't do that.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.514
I can test anyone randomly.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.083
And I have chosen you
randomly.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.117
That's not random.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.186
Okay, enie, meanie,
miney, moe.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.988
Is random.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.255
Okay, you know what?

12:02.289 --> 12:03.390
I'm gonna need
a volunteer

12:03.423 --> 12:05.325
to select one of these words.

12:05.358 --> 12:09.496
And tell us of something...
tragic that happened

12:09.529 --> 12:12.232
in either their lives
or the lives of a loved one.

12:13.466 --> 12:14.768
Yeah, Pam.

12:14.802 --> 12:18.238
I know that Jim
has an amazing story

12:18.271 --> 12:20.507
about a relative of his
who got caught up

12:20.540 --> 12:22.142
in the world of drugs.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.210
Really?

12:23.243 --> 12:24.277
Mmm-hmm.

12:24.311 --> 12:28.215
Jim, it's okay.
You can...

12:28.248 --> 12:30.317
This would be a good place
to let it out, Jim.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.151
These are people
you can trust.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.519
These are people
who care about you.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.254
It's okay.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.057
Just--we will
not judge you.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.525
We are here
to not judge you.

12:38.558 --> 12:44.031
Oh, he's doing it.
Okay.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.401
It's okay.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.149
Oh.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.917
Okay, are you sure?

13:03.951 --> 13:06.954
That looked like
it was gonna be good.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.256
All right.
Okay, well...

13:09.289 --> 13:10.557
Wow!

13:10.590 --> 13:13.193
He really pulled out
the big guns.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.595
Fake crying.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.331
Did not expect that.

13:18.365 --> 13:23.070
The point I'm trying to make
with all of this, people,

13:23.103 --> 13:24.838
is that I hate drugs.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.439
I hate them.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.877
And based upon
what I have seen,

13:29.910 --> 13:32.579
you all don't quite hate 'em
as much as I do.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.348
So you are going
to have a drug test.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.549
And I am not.

13:36.583 --> 13:37.885
No, you will be tested.

13:37.918 --> 13:38.919
Yes, I--no,
will not be.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.153
No, you will be.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.989
That is the law
according to the rules.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.056
Okay.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.092
Well, Dwight, just know...

13:45.125 --> 13:46.626
that I've been
very busy today.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.896
And I've got a lot
of work to do.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.463
And I wasn't planning
on going to the bathroom.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.464
And I don't even know
if anything's

13:51.498 --> 13:52.966
gonna come out, okay?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.935
So, good.
Thank you.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.438
Hi, Linda.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.073
Dwight Schrute.
Assistant Regional Manager.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.542
You might remember
testing my urine

14:02.575 --> 14:04.577
a few years back
when I was applying

14:04.611 --> 14:06.413
to be a Volunteer
Sheriff's Deputy.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.015
We test a lot of urine.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.883
Mine was green.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.886
Oh, right.

14:12.920 --> 14:13.887
How are you?

14:13.921 --> 14:14.988
I'm all better.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.256
So I need you
to do some work

14:16.289 --> 14:17.624
on the St. Andrew's account.

14:17.657 --> 14:18.926
I need your urine.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.260
I need some filing done.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.094
What kind of filing?

14:21.128 --> 14:24.064
That--just forget it.
Just the urine.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.533
That goes directly
to the tester.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.169
Just...

14:34.207 --> 14:38.245
I need your urine.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.346
Like, in a cup?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.915
Yes, in a cup.
We're not animals, Dwight.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.383
For what purpose?

14:43.416 --> 14:44.551
It's none of
your business.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.019
Then I refuse.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.320
Okay, all right.
Just...

14:47.354 --> 14:50.958
I went to
an Alicia Keys concert.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.626
Over the weekend.

14:53.660 --> 14:57.931
And I think I may have
gotten high accidentally

14:57.965 --> 14:59.666
by a girl
with a lip ring.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.035
Are you serious?

15:06.106 --> 15:14.114
I need clean urine
for the lady.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.115
But that's illegal.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.117
Don't think of it
that way.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.052
It's like...

15:19.086 --> 15:20.687
Urine goes all over the place,
you know?

15:20.720 --> 15:21.955
There's no controlling it.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.991
It just...
Not my urine.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.093
A cup could find its way
under the urine.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.594
It might be an accident.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.230
Were you forced to do drugs
at this concert?

15:30.263 --> 15:31.631
Is something wrong?

15:31.664 --> 15:35.535
Look, just...

15:35.568 --> 15:38.238
Just fill up the cup.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.510
Do you want to
give Michael your urine?

15:45.578 --> 15:48.348
I want him to have
all the urine he needs.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.284
You're not gonna get
my permission on this.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.485
I know that.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.521
Don't you think
I know that?

15:57.090 --> 15:59.292
Yeah, we do testing
all over the country.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.161
Cool.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.029
Hey, are you guys hiring?

16:02.062 --> 16:04.964
You wanna work
at the urinalysis lab?

16:07.134 --> 16:09.002
Yeah, maybe.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.477
My father's name
was Dwight Schrute.

16:17.510 --> 16:23.083
My grandfather's name
was Dwight Schrute.

16:23.116 --> 16:28.588
His father's name?
Dwiged Schrued.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.390
Amish.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.431
I loved my father very much.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.433
Every morning
he'd wake up at dawn

16:40.467 --> 16:42.469
and make us biscuits
with gravy.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.703
When I was little,
my dad and I

16:43.736 --> 16:45.238
played a lot of games
together.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.706
My dad cheated a lot,

16:46.739 --> 16:49.376
but I never busted him
on it.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.478
I would have, except I didn't
know about it.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.213
He didn't tell me
'til years later.

16:53.246 --> 16:57.450
I was shocked
when I found out.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.352
What?

16:59.386 --> 17:01.454
Did you wanna
tell me something?

17:01.488 --> 17:03.790
You look like
you wanna tell me something.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.258
You look like
you have something

17:05.292 --> 17:06.793
really important to say
and you just can't

17:06.826 --> 17:08.027
for some reason.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.465
Come on, you can tell me.

17:12.499 --> 17:16.336
Jim, you can tell me
anything.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.373
I'd like a magazine.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.175
We just need urine, sir.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.643
I'd still like one.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.479
Dwight.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.514
Well...

18:01.548 --> 18:03.583
I passed the test,
thanks to you

18:03.616 --> 18:05.485
and your untainted pee.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.120
Thank you very much.

18:07.154 --> 18:07.887
That's great.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.456
What's wrong?

18:09.489 --> 18:10.757
Where's your costume?

18:10.790 --> 18:12.392
It's a uniform.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.195
And I turned it in today
when I tendered my resignation.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.264
Why? What--

18:17.297 --> 18:20.567
I took an oath
when I was sworn in.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.435
And I broke that oath today.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.855
Here.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.457
Just buy it from me.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.160
I haven't talked
to you in hours,

18:47.194 --> 18:48.295
and it's been weird.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.496
And I really wanna know

18:49.529 --> 18:51.164
what the hell's going on
with Dwight.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.879
Hi.
Hey.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.281
How much time do you have left
on your break?

19:08.315 --> 19:09.349
10 minutes.

19:12.685 --> 19:16.256
Since you did such a good job
with the investigation,

19:16.289 --> 19:18.625
I decided to pull
a few strings,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.827
call in a few favors.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.329
And I've decided
to make you

19:22.362 --> 19:25.332
Official Security Supervisor
of the branch.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.334
Really?

19:27.367 --> 19:28.968
Yes, sir.
That's fantastic.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.338
'Cause I've always felt
that the security here sucked.

19:32.905 --> 19:37.277
So you wanna...

19:37.310 --> 19:38.478
"Dwight K. Schrute,

19:38.511 --> 19:41.948
"I hereby declare you
an honorary volunteer corporal

19:41.981 --> 19:46.353
in charge of assisting
all activity security."

19:46.386 --> 19:47.220
Good, okay?

19:47.254 --> 19:48.255
Here's your badge.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.391
Thank you, Michael.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.393
Very nice.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.395
Great.
Can I have a gun?

19:55.428 --> 19:57.530
No.
I don't have a gun.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.965
Okay.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.234
I'll have to bring in
my bow staff.

20:01.268 --> 20:04.804
I don't think so.
Don't.

20:04.837 --> 20:05.872
Good.
Thank you, Michael.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.508
No...oh...

20:11.411 --> 20:12.545
I need to go over
some details with you.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.846
First of all...
All right, well...

20:13.880 --> 20:16.249
Thank you.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.618
How many orange traffic cones
do you have?

20:18.651 --> 20:19.752
Two.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.322
Oh...God.

20:22.355 --> 20:25.558
Wow, what a terrible day
to not be able to talk.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.261
Dwight was literally carrying
around his own urine

20:28.295 --> 20:29.396
and dressed like
one of the Village People.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.998
Why does he do the things
that he does for Michael?

20:32.031 --> 20:33.433
I just don't get it.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.468
What is he getting
out of that relationship?
