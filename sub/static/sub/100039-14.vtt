00:02.380 --> 00:04.019
<i>after they visit the doctor.</i>

00:04.043 --> 00:06.112
Bear attack, Longfellow State Park.

00:06.146 --> 00:07.580
I got him. His wife arm's shredded.

00:07.614 --> 00:10.049
Scott? Scott?

00:10.083 --> 00:11.784
Scott!

00:11.852 --> 00:14.012
<i>We congratulate them
for putting on a brave face.</i>

00:14.080 --> 00:15.221
Scott!

00:17.457 --> 00:19.158
<i>Needles in their arm,</i>

00:19.192 --> 00:22.295
<i>strangers inspecting their
body for signs of illness.</i>

00:22.629 --> 00:25.097
<i>"Here's some candy, kid. Try to smile."</i>

00:30.003 --> 00:32.003
<i>We do it to adults, too.</i>

00:32.039 --> 00:33.198
- Are you Helm?
- Is this the...

00:33.222 --> 00:34.593
This is the nose. Can you
take that to Dr. Avery?

00:34.617 --> 00:35.374
Mm-hmm.

00:35.409 --> 00:36.797
<i>It's considered impolite to discuss</i>

00:36.821 --> 00:39.612
<i>your cancer diagnosis at a dinner party.</i>

00:43.091 --> 00:45.826
<i>You're supposed to smile,
make small talk,</i>

00:45.851 --> 00:47.818
<i>suck on the invisible lollipop.</i>

00:51.800 --> 00:55.736
<i>Because for some reason,
someone decided a long time ago</i>

00:55.770 --> 00:58.105
<i>that naming pain is impolite...</i>

00:59.307 --> 01:03.610
<i>...that hiding it and hiding
from it makes more sense.</i>

01:09.818 --> 01:11.051
<i>It doesn't.</i>

01:11.086 --> 01:12.353
<i>It's a lie,</i>

01:12.378 --> 01:16.415
<i>a lie that both comforts and destroys us.</i>

01:20.458 --> 01:22.065
Matty?

01:22.397 --> 01:24.401
Can you get me a soda?

01:30.651 --> 01:31.985
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

01:32.010 --> 01:33.244
All right.

01:34.906 --> 01:36.229
Okay.

01:39.154 --> 01:40.687
I know you said no medicine, but...

01:40.712 --> 01:42.813
I will speak with Dr. Riley.

01:45.231 --> 01:46.898
Do you mind calling pathology

01:46.923 --> 01:48.058
- to get the lab results?
- No problem.

01:48.082 --> 01:51.051
Hey, c-can we give her something
for the nausea, please?

01:51.076 --> 01:53.177
We are not suppressing her symptoms...

01:53.202 --> 01:54.368
we're studying them.

01:54.393 --> 01:55.760
Okay, but she's suffering.

01:55.785 --> 01:58.187
Suffering is better than dying.

01:58.212 --> 02:02.148
We need the diagnosis, DeLuca.

02:02.173 --> 02:03.473
Stay the course.

02:36.171 --> 02:38.967
Thought the baby might be hungry...

02:39.002 --> 02:40.811
even if you aren't.

02:46.013 --> 02:50.317
You sure we can't, um,
send a doctor to check in on you?

02:50.342 --> 02:51.585
An OB?

02:51.619 --> 02:53.387
An orthopedic surgeon?

02:53.455 --> 02:55.784
No. But thank you.

03:00.095 --> 03:01.495
Amelia.

03:01.563 --> 03:03.797
Maggie.

03:03.865 --> 03:05.099
Pretty recently,

03:05.133 --> 03:07.045
you were going through something.

03:08.082 --> 03:10.250
And you hid in your room,

03:10.505 --> 03:13.941
and you rejected both food and company.

03:13.975 --> 03:17.010
And we wanted to bury you
in love all day, every day,

03:17.045 --> 03:19.016
but you locked the door and...

03:20.315 --> 03:24.785
and we grudgingly respected
your desire for privacy.

03:25.230 --> 03:27.154
I appreciated that.

03:28.176 --> 03:29.410
I needed it.

03:31.185 --> 03:32.185
Fine.

03:32.210 --> 03:33.989
Eat the toast...

03:35.062 --> 03:36.825
and I'll spare you the comfort.

03:44.405 --> 03:46.106
Still haven't found
the perfect apartment?

03:46.141 --> 03:48.075
I've given up on perfect.

03:48.109 --> 03:51.131
Now I'm just hoping for
four walls and a floor.

03:51.859 --> 03:54.468
Unless you've reconsidered
letting me just stay with you.

03:55.169 --> 03:56.669
I thought we were past that.

03:56.871 --> 03:59.305
Right. We are. So I'm looking
at something tonight.

03:59.330 --> 04:00.497
You want to come?

04:00.522 --> 04:02.623
Tonight? Uh, I can't, sorry.

04:02.790 --> 04:04.791
You can't because you think I'm needy

04:04.826 --> 04:06.927
- and you're secretly over me or...
- No.

04:06.961 --> 04:10.264
Um, my... my parents
are in town, actually.

04:10.298 --> 04:12.114
Oh.

04:12.138 --> 04:13.739
Finally get to meet 'em.

04:13.773 --> 04:15.441
Uh, no, you do not want that.

04:15.475 --> 04:18.711
They're super critical and have
impossibly high standards.

04:18.745 --> 04:21.413
But good luck on that apartment.

04:24.985 --> 04:26.952
Schmitt. Plan on doing any work today,

04:26.987 --> 04:28.507
or are you just gonna stand and stare?

04:29.660 --> 04:31.463
Morning, Joey.

04:32.092 --> 04:33.959
Ready to do some PT?

04:33.994 --> 04:35.094
Again?

04:35.128 --> 04:37.200
Every eight hours.

04:37.234 --> 04:38.297
Okay.

04:38.331 --> 04:39.651
Let's check your range of motion.

04:41.935 --> 04:43.936
Okay.

04:46.862 --> 04:49.463
Abduction's to 45 degrees,
same as last two days.

04:51.011 --> 04:52.644
I'm not really feeling this.

04:52.679 --> 04:53.762
Could we just try again tomorrow?

04:53.786 --> 04:55.414
Joey, if you don't do your PT every day,

04:55.448 --> 04:57.449
you might never regain your mobility.

04:57.517 --> 04:59.151
Okay, that's enough for today.

04:59.219 --> 05:01.220
We'll be back to check
on you later, Joey.

05:01.454 --> 05:03.155
That's it?

05:03.223 --> 05:04.433
He's obviously feeling discouraged.

05:04.457 --> 05:06.325
So you're just gonna
let him off the hook?

05:06.350 --> 05:09.051
No, we need to find a way
to make it feel less daunting.

05:12.766 --> 05:15.501
Hey. Anything from Amelia?

05:15.535 --> 05:16.735
No.

05:16.803 --> 05:18.237
- Alex?
- No.

05:18.271 --> 05:20.672
There was a bear attack
last night, did you hear?

05:20.707 --> 05:22.351
Avery was out camping,
and this bear just...

05:22.375 --> 05:24.676
just came out of nowhere
and ripped this guy's nose off

05:24.711 --> 05:26.445
and severed his wife's brachial artery.

05:26.479 --> 05:28.781
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

05:28.815 --> 05:31.417
But that's not what this is, right?

05:31.451 --> 05:33.425
- What what is?
- Amelia? Alex?

05:33.492 --> 05:34.586
I'm not following.

05:34.621 --> 05:36.455
Do we have bears, Link, and not know it?

05:36.489 --> 05:38.424
Are we just sleeping soundly

05:38.458 --> 05:40.926
and they're gonna jump out of
nowhere and rip our noses off?

05:40.960 --> 05:43.529
Alex is going through
something with his family

05:43.596 --> 05:46.231
that he will tell you
about when he's ready

05:46.266 --> 05:48.540
because he's a good guy and he loves you.

05:48.721 --> 05:50.555
And you just got married.

05:50.722 --> 05:52.857
Right. Right.

05:53.039 --> 05:54.973
And Amelia just does this sometimes.

05:55.008 --> 05:56.642
What?

05:56.676 --> 05:58.377
Wait. What?

05:58.445 --> 06:01.847
Well, she and Owen were once
fighting over having kids,

06:01.881 --> 06:03.682
and then she just ghosted him

06:03.717 --> 06:05.361
and camped out at my
friend Stephanie's house.

06:05.385 --> 06:07.019
Drove her crazy,
but she couldn't say anything

06:07.053 --> 06:09.452
because Amelia was her boss, so...

06:10.590 --> 06:11.657
Oh.

06:11.691 --> 06:14.426
Uh, in all fairness, there was
a brain tumor back then

06:14.461 --> 06:15.610
that has since been removed.

06:15.645 --> 06:17.463
Think the brain tumor's back?

06:17.497 --> 06:19.331
We can hope.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.211
Well, what am I supposed
to do? Just wait it out?

06:22.235 --> 06:23.869
Avoid Owen and Teddy?

06:23.903 --> 06:26.004
Lock up your food, zip up your tent?

06:26.039 --> 06:27.973
Too dark?

06:28.041 --> 06:29.508
Never.

06:31.365 --> 06:32.978
<i>Dr. Brandy to the blood bank.</i>

06:33.113 --> 06:35.214
<i>Dr. Brandy to the blood bank.</i>

06:36.583 --> 06:38.550
Good morning, Dr. Webber!

06:38.585 --> 06:41.253
These doctors need your help.

06:41.287 --> 06:44.556
They need more training... your training.

06:44.591 --> 06:48.227
- Um... you'll excuse us.
- W...

06:48.261 --> 06:50.996
Is, uh, this you worrying about me

06:51.030 --> 06:53.599
because my marriage fell apart?

06:53.633 --> 06:54.863
Richard Webber.

06:54.897 --> 06:58.203
You have a gift for
spotting emerging talent

06:58.238 --> 07:00.439
and guiding them to excellence,

07:00.473 --> 07:03.208
and, yes, your marriage
fell apart, and...

07:03.243 --> 07:05.577
of course I'm worried about you, Richard.

07:06.980 --> 07:09.781
I'm fine. But thank you.

07:09.816 --> 07:11.517
Okay.

07:11.551 --> 07:12.928
But if you need to come by
for dinner this week...

07:12.952 --> 07:14.586
All right, let's go!

07:21.161 --> 07:22.761
Scott Burke, admitted last night

07:22.829 --> 07:24.486
for multiple chest lacerations,

07:24.521 --> 07:25.664
left hemothorax,

07:25.698 --> 07:27.766
and deep soft-tissue injuries to the face

07:27.800 --> 07:29.501
from a bear attack.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.602
Don't sugarcoat it.

07:30.637 --> 07:32.638
Damn animal took off my nose.

07:32.672 --> 07:35.374
- And we put it into your arm.
- All right, Scott.

07:35.408 --> 07:36.808
Ready to take a look?

07:37.877 --> 07:39.545
Thing of beauty.

07:39.579 --> 07:40.746
Oh.

07:41.507 --> 07:44.483
So, it's just gonna sit there?

07:44.517 --> 07:45.671
For how long?

07:45.706 --> 07:47.586
Well, we need your facial
wounds to heal first

07:47.620 --> 07:48.954
before we can reattach it.

07:49.022 --> 07:50.255
Got really good blood flow

07:50.290 --> 07:52.491
coming in from your radial artery here.

07:52.525 --> 07:54.993
And that'll keep it viable
until we're ready to reattach.

07:55.028 --> 07:58.597
And... my wife, Rachel?

07:58.665 --> 08:00.966
Can I see her?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.202
Okay, can you squeeze my fingers?

08:03.236 --> 08:06.189
Okay, she still has weakness
in median nerve distribution.

08:06.223 --> 08:07.639
Okay, Rachel.

08:07.674 --> 08:09.575
We repaired the artery last night,

08:09.609 --> 08:13.184
but today we need to do a washout
to prevent infection, okay?

08:13.680 --> 08:17.449
We, uh... We had j-just woken up,

08:17.474 --> 08:20.309
and Scott was gonna make some coffee.

08:20.334 --> 08:24.905
And out of nowhere, there was a-a-a bear.

08:25.077 --> 08:27.312
A h-huge bear.

08:27.553 --> 08:29.454
And S-Scott jumped in front of me,

08:29.784 --> 08:31.530
tried to protect me.

08:31.564 --> 08:33.760
He jumped in front of a bear for me.

08:33.794 --> 08:35.841
Yeah. And the good news is

08:35.866 --> 08:38.837
we found his nose and we
were able to salvage it, okay?

08:39.739 --> 08:42.039
Do you want us to take you to see him?

08:42.909 --> 08:44.341
Rach?

08:44.877 --> 08:47.546
Oh, my God. You scared
the hell out of me.

08:49.682 --> 08:50.983
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

08:51.017 --> 08:52.184
I love you.

08:52.218 --> 08:53.518
I love you so much, baby.

08:53.553 --> 08:55.053
Oh, God.

08:57.423 --> 08:59.258
Nurse Karen.

08:59.292 --> 09:01.203
Do you have any idea where
the video-game cart might be?

09:01.227 --> 09:03.362
I have a patient who
doesn't want to do his PT,

09:03.396 --> 09:04.529
and I think it might help.

09:04.564 --> 09:06.665
- Let me look.
- Thank you.

09:09.068 --> 09:11.236
Did you have any idea
you'd be in the arcade business

09:11.271 --> 09:12.271
when you took up peds?

09:12.305 --> 09:14.083
I'd be a lot more popular
with my kids if I was.

09:14.107 --> 09:15.651
All they want to do is play video games.

09:15.675 --> 09:17.019
I think I might just see
the top of their heads

09:17.043 --> 09:18.189
until they're 25.

09:18.223 --> 09:20.245
What are you guys working on?

09:20.280 --> 09:23.114
We are organizing a pro bono surgery day

09:23.182 --> 09:25.284
for people who can't afford insurance.

09:25.318 --> 09:26.473
Ah. Good.

09:26.507 --> 09:30.922
Uh, there's a-a game room
on the fourth floor.

09:30.957 --> 09:32.524
What, like a whole room just for PT?

09:32.592 --> 09:34.203
Well, it's not exactly
just a room for that...

09:34.227 --> 09:35.771
Uh, hey, hey, do you
remember, uh, a Fred...

09:35.795 --> 09:37.162
uh, sorry, Frank... Fred Mercer?

09:37.230 --> 09:38.607
You did a lap appy on him two years ago.

09:38.631 --> 09:39.631
You remember that?

09:39.666 --> 09:41.767
Kind of in the middle of
a conversation here, bud.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.485
- You speak Italian?
- You speak Italian?

09:48.741 --> 09:50.876
- Fourth floor, you said?
- Yeah, it's, um...

09:50.910 --> 09:52.542
it's in between the blue
and the green room. Yeah.

09:52.566 --> 09:53.612
Okay. Thank you.

09:53.646 --> 09:54.883
And, uh, count me in for that

09:54.908 --> 09:56.119
- pro bono surgery day, okay?
- Yes!

09:56.143 --> 09:58.093
- Hey, a Fred Mercer, okay? Stay with me.
- Put him down. Yes.

09:58.117 --> 09:59.928
I was going through some of the
transcripts from a lecture that you gave.

09:59.952 --> 10:01.453
You said he had post-op rashes

10:01.521 --> 10:02.731
and electrolyte abnormalities.

10:02.755 --> 10:05.123
Now, I need to know if his
appendix had a carcinoid tumor

10:05.158 --> 10:07.503
because he already shares two
symptoms with Suzanne Britland,

10:07.527 --> 10:09.305
so I'm thinking maybe
she's got a carcinoid tumor

10:09.329 --> 10:11.045
and, you know, we just can't see it.

10:11.079 --> 10:12.798
Okay.

10:12.832 --> 10:15.100
You've been going through
transcripts of my old lectures?

10:15.134 --> 10:17.012
Well, yeah, I'm going through
transcripts from everyone's lectures.

10:17.036 --> 10:19.671
When's the last time you slept, Andrew?

10:19.706 --> 10:21.373
What's that have to do with anything?

10:21.398 --> 10:23.699
You can't help Suzanne
if you're exhausted.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.859
You took Suzanne off
the meds three days ago.

10:25.884 --> 10:27.251
- Mm-hmm.
- Have you taken a break?

10:27.276 --> 10:30.244
Look, c-can you just...
answer the question, please?

10:32.062 --> 10:34.863
I think the rash was, um,

10:34.888 --> 10:36.956
propofol-infusion syndrome.

10:36.981 --> 10:38.181
Propofol infus... Okay.

10:38.358 --> 10:39.868
- You could try to run a CgA.
- Thank you.

10:39.892 --> 10:41.293
It didn't need to be that hard.

10:41.327 --> 10:43.895
DeLuca, the pericardial biopsy

10:43.963 --> 10:46.765
came back negative for carcinomatosis.

10:46.799 --> 10:48.047
Okay. Thank you.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.601
Excuse me.

10:49.635 --> 10:52.104
Is there any progress?

10:52.138 --> 10:54.406
Everything I rule out is progress.

10:54.440 --> 10:55.774
Are you working in shifts?

10:55.808 --> 10:57.609
Because he seems pretty fried.

10:57.643 --> 11:00.946
By the time I brought
someone else up to speed,

11:00.980 --> 11:03.915
Suzanne could be dead,
and DeLuca, he's a machine.

11:03.950 --> 11:07.018
He isn't a machine. He's a resident.

11:07.086 --> 11:08.464
And he seems like he could use a break.

11:08.488 --> 11:09.621
He's obsessing.

11:09.646 --> 11:12.354
I'm relying on that,

11:12.388 --> 11:15.550
and Suzanne's life may depend on it.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.055
Hi there, I called in sick.

11:26.080 --> 11:26.946
What?

11:26.981 --> 11:29.048
I thought we had a deal.

11:29.083 --> 11:30.546
I'm backing out of our deal.

11:30.581 --> 11:32.930
See, I appreciated the space

11:32.954 --> 11:35.131
because I grew up an only child

11:35.199 --> 11:38.101
and I am better at solving
problems on my own,

11:38.135 --> 11:40.637
but you grew up in a wolf pack,

11:40.671 --> 11:42.172
and wolves only retreat from the pack

11:42.206 --> 11:44.441
when they are going off alone to die.

11:44.475 --> 11:46.943
So, I'm backing out of our deal.

11:57.659 --> 11:59.029
Well, the only way I've ever seen you

11:59.053 --> 12:00.657
get yourself out of a really deep spiral

12:00.691 --> 12:03.893
is to spiral out loud
until you land on something

12:03.918 --> 12:06.753
that is healthier than whatever
is happening inside your head.

12:11.369 --> 12:15.031
For an only child,
you are an excellent sister.

12:20.911 --> 12:22.745
Hi!

12:22.813 --> 12:27.083
Your, uh, husband wants to see you.

12:27.117 --> 12:29.385
I-I sh... I should go, right?

12:29.420 --> 12:31.688
I mean, I-I go?

12:31.722 --> 12:33.157
He jumped in front of a bear for me.

12:33.181 --> 12:34.881
Babe.

12:34.959 --> 12:36.436
You have to tell him sooner or later.

12:36.460 --> 12:38.328
- Oh, God.
- Helm.

12:38.362 --> 12:40.129
I-I love him, o-okay?

12:40.164 --> 12:42.899
He's... He's my husband,
and I-I love him,

12:42.933 --> 12:45.668
but I'm not in...
in love with him anymore.

12:45.703 --> 12:47.837
I'm... I'm in love with Brian and...

12:48.672 --> 12:50.740
We went to high school together.

12:50.808 --> 12:52.575
Uh...

12:52.610 --> 12:54.077
We reconnected online,

12:54.111 --> 12:56.446
and, well, one thing led to another.

12:56.514 --> 12:57.447
I was gonna tell Scott

12:57.481 --> 12:59.949
on the... on the camp... camping trip.

12:59.974 --> 13:02.642
I th... I thought
the nature would be c...

13:02.667 --> 13:05.602
be comforting for... for him, and then...

13:05.627 --> 13:07.861
And then he jumped
in front of a bear for you.

13:07.886 --> 13:09.253
W-What... What do I do?

13:09.278 --> 13:10.925
I mean, what... what do I say?

13:10.950 --> 13:13.004
Neither one of you needs
any more stress right now,

13:13.029 --> 13:14.730
so we'll just... we'll let him know

13:14.755 --> 13:16.123
that we're prepping you for surgery.

13:16.147 --> 13:17.915
Helm, prep her for surgery,

13:17.940 --> 13:20.108
and bite your tongue.

13:22.922 --> 13:25.023
We will clean the wound to help her heal,

13:25.048 --> 13:26.381
but she should be fine.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.141
But can I see her before you take her?

13:29.166 --> 13:31.401
I'll sit in a wheelchair,
I-I-I'll be careful,

13:31.426 --> 13:32.636
what... what... whatever you want.

13:32.660 --> 13:35.595
I mean, I don't... I don't see why not.

13:35.620 --> 13:37.221
No, I'm... I'm sorry.

13:37.246 --> 13:40.248
The operating rooms are
on a strict schedule today,

13:40.273 --> 13:42.408
um, but we can update
you again when we're done.

13:44.795 --> 13:46.963
You'll tell her I-I love her?

13:52.193 --> 13:54.227
His wife is in love with someone else.

13:55.205 --> 13:57.473
Got it. O-kay.

13:57.498 --> 13:59.165
His wife is in love with someone else.

13:59.190 --> 14:01.358
I just lied to him while
he has a nose in his arm

14:01.383 --> 14:03.284
because he saved her from a bear.

14:03.309 --> 14:06.511
All right, well, sometimes patient care

14:06.536 --> 14:08.236
is... is complicated.

14:11.403 --> 14:12.780
Hey, little bunnies.

14:12.805 --> 14:14.239
- It's Mom.
- Oh, stop.

14:14.264 --> 14:15.530
It's doing something.

14:15.893 --> 14:17.699
All right, well, we've, uh...

14:17.734 --> 14:18.872
we've ruled out a lot of bad things,

14:18.896 --> 14:20.130
which is a-a good sign,

14:20.155 --> 14:21.657
but I do need to draw some more blood

14:21.681 --> 14:23.049
for a few more tests.

14:23.074 --> 14:24.341
Does she have any left?

14:24.366 --> 14:25.567
Hadley.

14:25.602 --> 14:27.119
Come on.

14:27.144 --> 14:28.895
I barely have enough energy for this.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.087
Sorry.

14:30.112 --> 14:31.645
Okay, um, I got it.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.037
- Let's do it again.
- Okay.

14:33.062 --> 14:34.496
Okay.

14:34.521 --> 14:36.556
Hey, little bunnies. It's me.

14:36.581 --> 14:37.720
I'm just checking to make sure

14:37.744 --> 14:39.574
that you're eating
all your carrots and...

14:39.599 --> 14:41.533
No, wait. It's doing
something to your mouth.

14:41.558 --> 14:43.192
- Huh?
- What?

14:43.217 --> 14:44.350
Oh, my God.

14:44.375 --> 14:46.009
Oh, my God. Her mouth is bleeding!

14:46.034 --> 14:47.968
What? What?

14:47.993 --> 14:49.827
Open your mouth for me, Suzanne.

14:49.852 --> 14:51.452
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:51.477 --> 14:53.211
- What's happening?
- I-I'm not sure.

14:53.236 --> 14:55.303
Oh!

14:55.328 --> 14:57.864
Platelet count went from 250 to 5.
All of her cell counts are down.

14:57.888 --> 14:59.656
- Well, what does it mean?
- I just said I don't know, okay?!

14:59.680 --> 15:01.280
I just... I-I'm sorry.

15:01.305 --> 15:03.106
I'm sorry.

15:03.131 --> 15:05.299
I... C-Can someone page
Dr. Riley, please?

15:05.324 --> 15:07.859
We need to prep for
a bone-marrow biopsy right now.

15:11.435 --> 15:14.170
Can I have her chart? Yeah.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.541
Oh. D-Dr. Grey?

15:19.644 --> 15:22.212
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:22.237 --> 15:23.572
I know you're worried about him, right?

15:23.596 --> 15:25.630
Yes, for a long time now.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.017
Yeah. He's exhausted.

15:27.042 --> 15:28.576
Riley is working him...

15:28.601 --> 15:30.201
Meredith, I came to Seattle

15:30.226 --> 15:32.594
because Andrew is now the
same age as our father was

15:32.619 --> 15:34.520
- when his symptoms started.
- Ohh.

15:34.545 --> 15:36.613
It... It runs in the family.

15:38.510 --> 15:40.344
I mean, he's been... he's been fine.

15:40.378 --> 15:42.813
It's just his patient's
circling the drain,

15:42.847 --> 15:44.281
he can't figure it out,

15:44.315 --> 15:45.582
and we've all been there.

15:45.617 --> 15:47.551
It's not just this patient, though.

15:47.585 --> 15:49.987
There have been warning signs...
high highs, low lows.

15:50.021 --> 15:51.655
Do you remember when Sam left

15:51.689 --> 15:53.657
and he couldn't get off your sofa?

15:53.691 --> 15:55.626
A-And then he went and
threw himself on the fire

15:55.660 --> 15:56.867
in Dr. Webber's operating room.

15:56.891 --> 15:59.463
He was very low, and he
was suddenly the opposite.

15:59.497 --> 16:01.432
Well, he does feel things very deeply.

16:01.466 --> 16:03.634
Failing to understand
or properly consider

16:03.668 --> 16:06.670
the consequences of your
actions is a sign of mania.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.839
He aggressively pursued
a relationship with his boss,

16:08.873 --> 16:10.274
he claimed credit for your crime,

16:10.308 --> 16:11.675
and then he went...

16:11.709 --> 16:12.843
to jail,

16:12.877 --> 16:14.745
prepared to lose his medical career.

16:14.779 --> 16:17.548
I mean, we're all a little
manic when we're in love.

16:17.582 --> 16:20.284
Yes, but you don't know
all his family history.

16:20.318 --> 16:22.252
He's not sleeping, he's not eating.

16:22.287 --> 16:25.222
Okay, so how do you tell
a healthy obsession from mania?

16:25.256 --> 16:27.825
He's a resident, and you're
chief of general surgery.

16:27.859 --> 16:29.399
Would you even think to ask that question

16:29.427 --> 16:30.932
if you didn't love him?

16:43.849 --> 16:45.684
Bailey, do you have a second?

16:47.653 --> 16:49.254
You okay?

16:49.288 --> 16:51.223
I'm perimenopausal, Grey.

16:51.257 --> 16:52.558
You know what that means.

16:52.592 --> 16:53.892
I go to bed freezing,

16:53.926 --> 16:56.428
and then I wake up in the
middle of the night broiling.

16:56.462 --> 16:58.764
I'm in an all-night battle
with my blanket.

16:58.831 --> 17:00.632
I'm happy, then I'm sad, I'm laughing,

17:00.666 --> 17:03.769
and then I want to
throw this fan at the wall.

17:03.803 --> 17:04.636
Am I okay?

17:04.671 --> 17:07.638
I mean, what, women are
51% of the population,

17:07.673 --> 17:09.141
and every single one of them

17:09.209 --> 17:11.276
have or will experience this joy

17:11.310 --> 17:13.178
at some time in their lives,

17:13.246 --> 17:15.614
so in that sense, I guess I'm just fine.

17:15.647 --> 17:16.915
Talk.

17:17.849 --> 17:20.519
I'm worried about our chief resident.

17:24.490 --> 17:25.800
You waiting for me to put this fan down?

17:25.825 --> 17:27.325
'Cause that's not gonna happen, Grey.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.694
Sit down. Tell me more.

17:29.729 --> 17:31.596
Okay, so, you're familiar with this case.

17:37.702 --> 17:39.370
You're holding it sideways.

17:39.395 --> 17:40.996
Don't come for me.

17:41.021 --> 17:42.889
The tips of the Maryland
should be pointing down,

17:42.913 --> 17:44.080
right, Dr. Webber?

17:46.651 --> 17:47.612
Uh, what's that?

17:47.647 --> 17:49.281
The tip should be pointing down...

17:49.306 --> 17:50.407
the Maryland dissectors?

17:50.432 --> 17:51.499
Uh, yeah, yeah.

17:53.352 --> 17:54.753
Is this a mind game?

17:54.787 --> 17:57.322
Maybe he doesn't like know-it-alls.

18:02.445 --> 18:04.830
Do you get this involved
with every patient?

18:04.864 --> 18:06.665
Most patients aren't this difficult.

18:06.699 --> 18:09.234
Yeah. Just the fun ones.

18:11.504 --> 18:14.952
So, are you still dating your boss?

18:16.003 --> 18:19.311
I observe people closely
because I have to

18:19.378 --> 18:21.780
as a doctor and as a person,

18:21.848 --> 18:25.417
and the way people who
have slept together argue

18:25.451 --> 18:27.766
is very different than
people who have not.

18:27.800 --> 18:31.423
Their bodies have a completely
different language.

18:31.448 --> 18:33.148
We're still dating, I think.

18:33.173 --> 18:35.974
Hmm. That would explain her concern.

18:35.999 --> 18:37.825
Concern? What, did she
say something to you?

18:39.198 --> 18:42.000
Just wants to make sure
I don't work you to death.

18:42.034 --> 18:43.735
It was nice.

18:47.907 --> 18:49.441
You see, Joey? It couldn't be easier.

18:49.466 --> 18:51.600
It's exactly like your
PT exercises, so go on.

18:51.625 --> 18:52.887
- Give it a try.
- No, thanks.

18:52.912 --> 18:54.346
- Just try it.
- No.

18:54.380 --> 18:56.848
Joey, you could lose
your ability to use your arm.

18:56.883 --> 18:58.650
I can't play video games!

19:01.133 --> 19:02.667
I'm here with video games

19:02.692 --> 19:04.560
and people taking care of me.

19:04.585 --> 19:07.020
I sleep in a warm bed, and I have no idea

19:07.045 --> 19:09.346
if my little sister and brothers are okay

19:09.371 --> 19:11.673
or if they're safe or if they're scared.

19:12.176 --> 19:14.466
Uh, you guys are all
worried about my arm,

19:14.500 --> 19:16.034
but I'm shaking.

19:16.068 --> 19:17.836
Look, I'm so scared
for them, I'm shaking.

19:17.870 --> 19:19.704
Why doesn't anyone care about that?

19:20.071 --> 19:22.172
Why doesn't anyone try to fix that?

19:25.350 --> 19:27.718
Okay, more irrigation.

19:29.081 --> 19:31.583
What if you, uh

19:31.608 --> 19:34.676
Found out Amelia's baby was yours?

19:34.701 --> 19:36.135
What?

19:36.576 --> 19:37.938
Why would you say that?

19:37.972 --> 19:40.692
It's... It's a hypothetical.

19:40.717 --> 19:42.951
That's not something I want to consider.

19:42.976 --> 19:43.971
Why not?

19:43.996 --> 19:46.097
Would it change things for you and Teddy?

19:46.165 --> 19:47.766
Karev, why are you asking me this?

19:47.800 --> 19:50.068
Alex went home to Iowa,

19:50.102 --> 19:51.342
and I've barely heard from him,

19:51.370 --> 19:53.872
and my worst-case-scenario
meter is off the charts right now

19:53.906 --> 19:55.774
because this patient is
cheating on her husband

19:55.808 --> 19:58.910
right under his nose,
which is in his arm.

19:58.945 --> 19:59.945
And you think Alex is...

19:59.979 --> 20:02.347
She reconnected with
an ex from high school,

20:02.382 --> 20:03.592
and then one thing led to another.

20:03.616 --> 20:04.783
So what if he just

20:04.817 --> 20:07.052
ran into some old girlfriend
from high school

20:07.086 --> 20:08.887
and one thing led to another?

20:08.912 --> 20:10.255
Okay. Ready to pack.

20:13.326 --> 20:14.493
Jo, it took me a long, long time

20:14.527 --> 20:16.795
to get to this place in
my life with me and Teddy,

20:16.829 --> 20:18.701
you know, just like you and Karev.

20:19.938 --> 20:21.939
I'm not gonna screw that up for anything.

20:22.547 --> 20:24.068
And neither is your husband.

20:28.887 --> 20:31.255
Chief, i-if this can wait,
please, I got to...

20:31.280 --> 20:34.815
Dr. DeLuca, all surgeons
occasionally have patients

20:34.840 --> 20:36.207
that get under their skin.

20:36.232 --> 20:37.665
- What, uh...
- But...

20:37.690 --> 20:38.857
Hmm. No, no, no.

20:38.882 --> 20:40.382
What did she tell you?

20:40.407 --> 20:42.274
That I'm making mistakes?
Because I'm not.

20:42.299 --> 20:44.801
Uh, Meredith Grey will be taking over

20:44.826 --> 20:46.627
Suzanne Britland's care.

20:46.652 --> 20:49.721
Every test, every treatment
will be approved by her.

20:49.996 --> 20:51.162
She's my patient.

20:51.197 --> 20:53.402
She's the hospital's patient.

20:53.899 --> 20:55.433
And you need to get some rest.

20:55.468 --> 20:57.736
So what's your plan,
then? Do you even have one?

20:59.325 --> 21:01.259
I have instructed Dr. Grey

21:01.284 --> 21:04.019
to put Suzanne Britland
back on her medication

21:04.044 --> 21:05.098
- while she continues
- No, no.

21:05.122 --> 21:06.120
To seek a diagnosis.

21:06.145 --> 21:07.612
So your plan is to kill her, then.

21:07.647 --> 21:09.281
Dr. DeLuca, do I need to remind you

21:09.315 --> 21:10.682
to whom you are speaking?

21:10.716 --> 21:11.727
Just because this hasn't worked yet

21:11.751 --> 21:13.295
does not mean that it won't, okay?

21:13.319 --> 21:14.619
We are on the verge of something.

21:14.654 --> 21:16.621
I-I know it. I can feel it. Please.

21:16.656 --> 21:19.157
Meredith Grey is the
chief of general surgery.

21:19.191 --> 21:20.525
You should be grateful

21:20.559 --> 21:22.794
she's taken an interest in your case.

21:22.828 --> 21:23.962
Get some sleep.

21:23.996 --> 21:25.276
Dr. Bailey, please.

21:25.311 --> 21:26.831
DeLuca, walk away now

21:26.866 --> 21:28.967
before you say something you'll regret.

21:38.629 --> 21:39.796
Dr. Bailey.

21:39.821 --> 21:41.342
I've been working with Joey Phillips.

21:41.732 --> 21:43.966
Oh, let me guess.
He doesn't want to do PT.

21:43.991 --> 21:45.325
How'd you know?

21:45.350 --> 21:47.318
'Cause he doesn't want
to do much of anything.

21:47.343 --> 21:48.778
Yeah, well, the poor kid
was living on the street

21:48.802 --> 21:49.870
before they brought him in here.

21:49.894 --> 21:51.225
I'd like to try to find
a way to help him.

21:51.249 --> 21:53.183
You don't think I want to help him?

21:53.217 --> 21:55.085
I mean, all I think about is, you know,

21:55.110 --> 21:56.971
what happens when he's
ready to be discharged?

21:56.995 --> 21:58.136
Then what?

21:58.161 --> 22:00.062
Do we put him back on the street?

22:00.087 --> 22:01.255
And th... Okay, and then let's say

22:01.279 --> 22:03.948
he manages to find a place to live,

22:03.973 --> 22:05.987
finish high school, go to college.

22:06.011 --> 22:09.013
Well, who visits him on parents' weekend?

22:09.047 --> 22:10.258
Where does he go for Thanksgiving?

22:10.282 --> 22:12.683
Who shows up at his graduation

22:12.717 --> 22:15.219
with embarrassing signs and a foghorn?

22:15.253 --> 22:16.987
Um...

22:17.022 --> 22:20.656
I actually wasn't
thinking that far ahead.

22:21.126 --> 22:23.260
I was thinking more like
how can I help him today.

22:23.295 --> 22:25.095
Sure, uh, oka... Oh.

22:25.130 --> 22:27.131
H-He'd like to talk to
his brothers and sister.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.273
Do you know anyone we can call?

22:33.872 --> 22:36.240
So, he's healthy.

22:37.442 --> 22:39.743
- And that feels like a miracle.
- Mm.

22:39.768 --> 22:43.304
And, uh, he's already
the size of a cabbage,

22:43.468 --> 22:48.439
uh, which means that I am
further along than I thought.

22:48.464 --> 22:52.500
So, um, the baby might be Owen's,

22:52.745 --> 22:53.845
not Link's.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.093
Might be, or is?

22:57.155 --> 22:58.222
Might be.

22:58.247 --> 23:00.014
Um, I don't know.

23:00.039 --> 23:03.074
There wasn't a ton of time

23:03.099 --> 23:05.333
between the breakup and the hookup.

23:09.074 --> 23:10.708
Link and I are really good together,

23:10.742 --> 23:15.813
um, like, almost painfully good.

23:17.088 --> 23:18.689
You know, it felt like

23:18.714 --> 23:21.449
that thing that we'd
both earned in this life.

23:22.541 --> 23:26.379
It was accidental and
it was perfect, and...

23:29.739 --> 23:30.995
And now it's not.

23:31.553 --> 23:34.198
Because he wants to know
the baby's biology?

23:34.223 --> 23:35.256
Because he's, um,

23:35.281 --> 23:38.283
not sure that he wants to be with me

23:38.308 --> 23:40.194
if the baby isn't his.

23:41.206 --> 23:44.041
And that makes me not so sure

23:44.075 --> 23:45.276
that I want to be with him

23:45.310 --> 23:49.246
if the baby is his.

23:53.151 --> 23:55.486
You and Owen have
a complicated relationship.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.554
Mm-hmm.

23:56.621 --> 23:57.711
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:57.745 --> 23:59.963
Um, that's what he said.

24:00.031 --> 24:02.092
But I want him to love me enough

24:02.127 --> 24:04.261
that that doesn't matter.

24:05.196 --> 24:08.198
I love you more than
my biological sisters.

24:08.233 --> 24:09.807
Biology doesn't matter.

24:10.869 --> 24:12.469
Love matters.

24:14.072 --> 24:15.906
Okay.

24:15.941 --> 24:17.481
And, still,

24:18.890 --> 24:21.726
if I were Link, I would be terrified.

24:23.415 --> 24:26.061
I would terrified that the baby is Owen's

24:26.972 --> 24:30.375
and that, if it is,
that connection might reignite

24:30.400 --> 24:33.269
whatever embers still exist
between you and Owen.

24:33.458 --> 24:37.293
If I were Link,
I would want to know, too.

24:38.690 --> 24:40.390
And it wouldn't have anything to do

24:40.415 --> 24:41.849
with how much I love you.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.552
Okay, but can you stop
pretending that you're Link?

24:51.209 --> 24:53.209
Can you pretend that
you're me for a minute?

24:54.853 --> 24:57.621
Okay. Okay, okay.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.181
Okay.

25:00.206 --> 25:02.741
Okay, if I'm you...

25:05.156 --> 25:09.159
...imagine that the hormones
coursing through my body

25:09.194 --> 25:10.961
would be overwhelming.

25:13.531 --> 25:15.966
They might overwhelm rationality,

25:16.001 --> 25:17.601
and I just might want to be held...

25:20.271 --> 25:24.074
...and, um, loved no matter what...

25:26.678 --> 25:29.146
...and reassured that
I'm not going to be alone.

25:31.182 --> 25:33.250
Hey, I love you.

25:33.284 --> 25:35.352
I got you. I got you.

25:35.387 --> 25:37.821
You're not gonna be alone.

25:39.224 --> 25:40.814
I love you.

25:51.169 --> 25:52.603
Oh. Hey, how you doing?

25:53.505 --> 25:55.239
Uh, great.

25:55.306 --> 25:56.306
Yeah. You?

25:56.341 --> 25:57.708
Uh, Teddy's still got the flu,

25:57.742 --> 26:00.511
so I'm in single-dad mode,
but I can't complain.

26:00.545 --> 26:02.813
Everything okay? Not freaking out?

26:03.972 --> 26:05.706
Trying not to.

26:05.817 --> 26:09.386
Amelia's... what, she's...
she's halfway there, right?

26:09.421 --> 26:11.655
Yeah, something like that.

26:11.690 --> 26:12.700
I noticed she missed a couple days.

26:12.724 --> 26:14.792
Everything okay?
There's no complications or...

26:16.127 --> 26:18.362
Things are definitely complicated,

26:18.396 --> 26:19.963
but, uh... but the baby's healthy.

26:19.998 --> 26:20.998
Good, good.

26:21.032 --> 26:22.966
That's good.

26:25.704 --> 26:27.204
Yeah, when Teddy was pregnant,

26:27.238 --> 26:29.473
I remember feeling
useless most of the time.

26:29.498 --> 26:31.632
Definitely feel useless.

26:31.657 --> 26:32.757
Yeah. How can you not?

26:32.844 --> 26:34.211
I mean, women go through something

26:34.245 --> 26:35.446
that we can't ever comprehend.

26:35.513 --> 26:38.215
Best we can do is
just listen, sympathize,

26:38.249 --> 26:40.984
and just keep trying to help...

26:41.052 --> 26:43.621
...even if you're not sure how.

26:50.995 --> 26:54.364
I'm the one who got
kicked off the case, not you.

26:54.399 --> 26:55.966
You can stay, so stay.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.434
Please. Consult.

26:57.469 --> 26:58.769
Consult?

26:58.803 --> 27:02.319
Your chief of surgery gave an
order that undoes everything.

27:02.688 --> 27:04.374
I was...

27:04.442 --> 27:06.310
We were making progress.

27:06.344 --> 27:11.048
But now we've really made that
poor woman suffer for nothing.

27:13.985 --> 27:15.385
Just e-mail me the autopsy report,

27:15.420 --> 27:18.120
and maybe we'll know what happens then.

27:20.111 --> 27:22.213
- Are you even listening to me?
- I-It's Suzanne's bone-marrow results.

27:22.237 --> 27:24.405
Th-They're showing something
called hemophagocytosis?

27:24.430 --> 27:25.878
Have you heard of that?

27:29.968 --> 27:33.770
That's MAS,
macrophage activation syndrome.

27:35.106 --> 27:38.229
Her white cells are eating
her other blood cells.

27:38.263 --> 27:39.224
Okay, okay.

27:39.249 --> 27:40.888
It's a complication I've
seen of Still's disease.

27:40.912 --> 27:42.347
I've never seen it before in person.

27:42.371 --> 27:44.740
- MAS or Still's?
- Either.

27:44.765 --> 27:46.365
It's extremely rare.

27:46.451 --> 27:48.752
Okay, so... so this is it?
We... We figured it out?

27:48.787 --> 27:50.254
Yeah!

27:50.694 --> 27:52.322
But we don't have much time

27:52.357 --> 27:53.768
- before her organs shut down.
- Yeah. Right.

27:53.792 --> 27:55.824
Okay, let's go, let's go. Come on.

27:57.295 --> 27:58.729
She'll need a few weeks' downtime

27:58.797 --> 28:00.164
and some physical therapy,

28:00.198 --> 28:02.372
but she should make a full recovery.

28:06.571 --> 28:08.837
I used to judge people who, uh...

28:09.541 --> 28:13.977
people like me, home-wreckers.

28:14.012 --> 28:17.314
I never in a million years
thought that I would...

28:17.348 --> 28:19.216
thought that I could.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.751
What happened?

28:20.785 --> 28:22.319
Why did you?

28:23.143 --> 28:25.656
Life came in and taught
me not to judge others.

28:25.690 --> 28:29.259
Life came in and turned me
upside down and shook me.

28:31.496 --> 28:35.265
I'm so in love with her that
I don't care who gets hurt.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.468
I just don't want it to be me.

28:39.326 --> 28:41.138
Now, look, I know how that sounds,

28:41.206 --> 28:43.173
but I'm not a terrible person.

28:43.208 --> 28:45.142
I-I take care of my parents.

28:45.176 --> 28:47.337
I-I mentor my students.

28:48.146 --> 28:49.479
I plant trees on the weekends,

28:49.514 --> 28:51.849
and I... and I buy groceries
for homeless people.

28:51.883 --> 28:54.785
I'm not a terrible person.

28:56.287 --> 28:58.589
I'm just a person who's terribly in love.

29:05.363 --> 29:06.930
V-fib. Paddles.

29:06.965 --> 29:08.432
What the hell happened?

29:08.466 --> 29:09.233
He was talking,

29:09.267 --> 29:11.101
and he coded right in front of us.

29:11.126 --> 29:13.185
Uh, chest tube put out
about 400 ccs of blood.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.263
He's bleeding into his chest.

29:14.287 --> 29:15.349
All right, I got it.
Move, Helm. Thank you.

29:15.373 --> 29:18.242
Okay, charge to 120. And... clear.

29:19.377 --> 29:21.144
Still V-fib. All right, push another epi.

29:21.179 --> 29:23.180
Charge to 200.

29:23.214 --> 29:24.548
Okay, and clear.

29:24.582 --> 29:25.983
Come on, Scott! Come on!

29:26.017 --> 29:27.461
- I'm gonna open his chest.
- Where? Here?

29:27.485 --> 29:28.852
Yeah. Here.

29:28.887 --> 29:30.100
Here, let's go. All right. Come on.

29:30.124 --> 29:31.221
Betadine.

29:50.531 --> 29:52.966
Hey. Um...

29:53.001 --> 29:55.369
Brian, could you give us a minute?

29:55.403 --> 29:57.548
I need to talk to Rachel,
and I think it would be better I...

29:57.572 --> 29:59.640
What is it? Is it... Is it Scott?

29:59.707 --> 30:02.342
Is it... Does he know? Did he see Brian?

30:02.377 --> 30:04.286
No.

30:05.580 --> 30:07.481
No, he didn't see Brian.

30:09.784 --> 30:12.286
I'm sorry. Scott, he...

30:12.320 --> 30:15.155
he had major bleeding inside his chest.

30:15.189 --> 30:18.058
We tried to resuscitate him,
but we couldn't.

30:18.092 --> 30:19.293
He died.

30:19.327 --> 30:21.561
W-W-W-What?

30:21.596 --> 30:22.663
Sweetie, I'm...

30:22.697 --> 30:24.564
Don't... Don't... Don't touch me.

30:24.632 --> 30:25.966
Rachel, I...

30:28.202 --> 30:30.537
Please.

30:30.605 --> 30:32.372
Please, please.

30:34.642 --> 30:36.677
Please, you need to leave. Please.

30:57.265 --> 30:58.942
You've reached Alex Karev.
Leave a message.

30:58.966 --> 31:00.467
Hey, Alex.

31:00.501 --> 31:02.436
I...

31:02.470 --> 31:04.304
I need you to call me.

31:04.339 --> 31:06.273
I need to hear your voice.

31:06.307 --> 31:07.841
I need to know what's going on,

31:07.875 --> 31:10.043
whatever it is.

31:13.648 --> 31:16.450
Whatever it is, I need to know.

31:16.517 --> 31:17.951
I want to know.

31:17.985 --> 31:19.453
Because...

31:19.487 --> 31:22.322
Because I would jump in
front of a bear for you, Alex.

31:24.258 --> 31:26.493
Please call me.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.768
Hey, Joey.

31:34.802 --> 31:36.447
We thought maybe you
could use a little company.

31:36.471 --> 31:37.671
I just want to be alone.

31:37.705 --> 31:39.072
You sure about that?

31:43.411 --> 31:44.888
- You guys are here?!
- Careful of your arm.

31:44.912 --> 31:46.113
I can't believe it!

31:46.147 --> 31:49.449
Well, Dr. Bailey made a few
calls, pulled a few strings.

31:50.685 --> 31:52.252
Are you guys okay?

31:52.286 --> 31:53.330
How are your new foster parents?

31:53.354 --> 31:55.922
I have a pretty nice lady
who makes pancakes.

31:55.957 --> 31:58.058
Ours is actually okay.

31:58.092 --> 31:59.960
I know you told us not to get help,

32:00.027 --> 32:02.262
but I was scared, and I'm sorry.

32:02.330 --> 32:04.498
No. Hey, it's okay.

32:04.532 --> 32:05.614
You did the right thing.

32:05.648 --> 32:07.200
I'm just glad you're all okay.

32:07.235 --> 32:08.902
I have my own room with a purple bed.

32:08.936 --> 32:10.637
Oh, yeah?

32:10.705 --> 32:11.972
Now, they can't stay all night,

32:12.006 --> 32:14.141
but they can stick around for pizza.

32:14.175 --> 32:15.208
- Yes!
- Ooh.

32:15.243 --> 32:18.545
And video games,
'cause that PT is nonnegotiable.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.486
Hmm.

32:27.021 --> 32:29.156
<i>Dr. Evans to the psych ward.</i>

32:29.223 --> 32:31.124
<i>- Dr. Evans to the psych ward.</i>
- Perez?

32:31.159 --> 32:33.036
What, aren't you supposed
to be with Dr. Webber?

32:33.060 --> 32:34.594
Oh, he said we could leave early.

32:34.629 --> 32:37.330
Good night, Chief Bailey. You're an icon.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.601
It's not even 5:00!

32:47.008 --> 32:48.241
Hey, Suzanne.

32:48.276 --> 32:50.677
Dr. DeLuca. What are you doing?

32:50.711 --> 32:52.846
Suzanne, you have Still's disease.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.648
It's rare, really rare.

32:54.682 --> 32:56.542
Fewer than one in a
million people have it.

32:56.576 --> 32:57.757
Dr. DeLuca, what are you doing?

32:57.781 --> 33:00.030
I don't have time, Dr. Grey.
I don't have time to ask your permission

33:00.054 --> 33:01.532
to treat a patient that
I've been monitoring

33:01.556 --> 33:02.756
around the clock.

33:02.790 --> 33:04.791
DeLuca, let's step away
from the IV, please.

33:07.228 --> 33:09.162
What did he just do?
What did you give her?!

33:09.230 --> 33:11.031
Suzanne, there's no cure
for Still's disease,

33:11.065 --> 33:12.332
but it can be managed,

33:12.400 --> 33:13.366
and I just gave you high-dose steroids,

33:13.401 --> 33:15.402
and if I'm right, you should
start feeling better

33:15.470 --> 33:17.337
almost immediately, okay?

33:17.371 --> 33:19.005
Dr. DeLuca, out in the hallway, please?

33:19.040 --> 33:20.740
Wait, what if you're wrong?

33:20.775 --> 33:22.075
- He's not.
- I'm not.

33:22.109 --> 33:26.646
Andrew, we couldn't have had a
conversation before you did that?

33:26.681 --> 33:27.681
Andrew!

33:32.987 --> 33:35.155
Well, if you're wrong,
the steroids could kill her.

33:35.189 --> 33:36.389
I'm not wrong.

33:36.457 --> 33:39.192
You were wrong to take
our case away from us.

33:39.227 --> 33:40.727
He is my resident.

33:40.761 --> 33:42.262
I am his supervisor.

33:42.296 --> 33:44.030
You're also his girlfriend.

33:44.065 --> 33:46.099
It's muddy.

33:46.133 --> 33:47.801
She'll need supervision.

33:58.191 --> 34:00.191
...make you sleepy.

34:00.999 --> 34:02.433
You look like a new person.

34:02.467 --> 34:03.767
I feel like one.

34:03.802 --> 34:05.502
God, I feel alive again.

34:05.570 --> 34:07.604
So, um, was it the appendectomy

34:07.639 --> 34:08.849
that gave her the Still's disease?

34:08.873 --> 34:10.774
Oh, no, we suspect she had it before.

34:10.809 --> 34:12.286
The flu-like symptoms and the fatigue,

34:12.310 --> 34:13.342
that's all a part of it.

34:13.411 --> 34:14.945
Oh. And I thought I was just tired

34:14.978 --> 34:16.268
from chasing my kids around.

34:16.303 --> 34:18.614
Your innate immune system
was in overdrive,

34:18.650 --> 34:20.016
and the high-dose steroids

34:20.051 --> 34:21.518
are bringing that back to normal,

34:21.553 --> 34:23.053
but you can't stay on those forever.

34:23.088 --> 34:24.054
So, then what's next?

34:24.089 --> 34:26.123
We're going to set you up
with a rheumatologist.

34:26.157 --> 34:28.358
People with Still's disease
can live very full lives.

34:28.426 --> 34:30.505
We just need to get you
on the right medication.

34:31.196 --> 34:33.030
Can you set me up with my kids?

34:33.063 --> 34:35.699
Yes. Now that your counts
are up, that's next on the list.

34:35.766 --> 34:38.135
I don't know how you all
figured this out, but thank you.

34:38.168 --> 34:40.204
Of course. Let me go
work on that for you.

34:40.237 --> 34:41.505
Excuse me.

34:45.275 --> 34:46.406
You should get in there

34:46.431 --> 34:47.855
- and let them thank you.
- I'm good.

34:47.879 --> 34:49.356
Why don't you go in there
and take the credit?

34:49.380 --> 34:51.225
You took the case over,
right? It's your patient.

34:51.248 --> 34:53.382
Andrew, that was an amazing diagnosis.

34:53.418 --> 34:54.551
You saved her life.

34:54.585 --> 34:56.453
Yeah, no thanks to you.

34:57.054 --> 34:59.723
Andrew, but if you had been wrong,

34:59.757 --> 35:01.191
those steroids could have wiped out

35:01.226 --> 35:02.860
her entire bone marrow.

35:02.894 --> 35:04.528
If you had been wrong,

35:04.562 --> 35:06.063
your decision to go rogue

35:06.097 --> 35:08.031
could've cost you your entire career.

35:08.066 --> 35:09.833
Okay, i-if I had asked your permission

35:09.901 --> 35:11.679
to administer the steroids,
would you have granted it?

35:11.703 --> 35:13.170
I would have asked a few questions.

35:13.238 --> 35:14.782
Yes, and she could've died when you did.

35:14.806 --> 35:16.283
Okay, listen, Andrew, you saved her life.

35:16.307 --> 35:18.075
No one is trying to
take that away from you.

35:18.109 --> 35:20.377
All I'm saying is you
could've taken a moment

35:20.411 --> 35:22.880
to just tell me what you were giving her.

35:22.914 --> 35:24.348
Because at that time,

35:24.415 --> 35:26.283
you were not in the right state of mind

35:26.317 --> 35:27.851
to be making life-or-death decisions.

35:27.886 --> 35:30.320
Right decisions.
Life-saving decisions, Mer.

35:30.388 --> 35:33.190
Andrew, you're not sleeping,
you're not eating...

35:33.224 --> 35:35.692
- What?
- You are not acting like yourself.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.061
You are unbelievable!

35:38.096 --> 35:40.107
You're such a hypocrite!
All... All... All the rules

35:40.131 --> 35:42.068
apply to everybody else
except for you, is that it?!

35:43.171 --> 35:44.368
Hey.

35:44.402 --> 35:46.503
Okay, Hayes, it's fine. We're fine.

35:46.538 --> 35:47.571
I saved her life!

35:47.605 --> 35:49.072
I did that, okay?!

35:49.107 --> 35:52.509
Against all odds, it was a
one-in-a-million diagnosis!

35:52.577 --> 35:54.144
I did the job that needed to be done!

35:54.179 --> 35:56.555
Andrew, listen to yourself!

35:57.115 --> 35:58.715
You sound like your father.

36:01.486 --> 36:04.688
Just please, can you just
go home and get some sleep?

36:04.722 --> 36:07.024
You just need to go get some sleep.

36:07.058 --> 36:10.327
I don't need this, and I don't need you.

36:11.596 --> 36:13.897
So we're done.

36:13.932 --> 36:15.098
I'm done.

36:20.338 --> 36:22.149
You should write him up,
Grey. That's not okay.

36:22.173 --> 36:23.974
Yeah, thanks.

36:36.287 --> 36:38.655
I told you I don't need
you checking up on me.

36:38.690 --> 36:40.791
And I don't need my
residents leaving early

36:40.825 --> 36:43.527
because they've
"done enough for the day."

36:46.364 --> 36:48.189
I don't have it in me, Bailey.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.001
I mean, that set...

36:51.035 --> 36:52.636
they aren't Grey-Sloan caliber.

36:52.670 --> 36:54.487
They shouldn't be here.

36:55.206 --> 36:56.974
I mean, at Pac-North,
trying to teach them

36:57.008 --> 36:59.476
felt... like a challenge.

36:59.510 --> 37:00.577
But this...

37:00.612 --> 37:04.148
This feels like punishment.

37:04.282 --> 37:07.017
Feels like Catherine won

37:07.051 --> 37:10.587
and she's rubbing my nose
in it all day every day.

37:10.655 --> 37:14.257
I know this isn't an easy time.

37:15.126 --> 37:17.194
But I want to help.

37:17.228 --> 37:18.962
Tell me how to help you.

37:21.866 --> 37:23.516
I'm just tired.

37:24.769 --> 37:27.037
Just bone tired.

37:28.273 --> 37:29.973
Well, that sounds like depression.

37:34.412 --> 37:36.246
I appreciate the concern.

37:39.017 --> 37:40.350
I'll be okay.

37:48.226 --> 37:49.326
I did it!

37:49.394 --> 37:51.395
I got Joey to do PT

37:51.429 --> 37:53.897
because I am an excellent doctor.

37:56.467 --> 37:58.268
And I want to meet your family.

37:58.303 --> 38:00.337
It doesn't have to be a whole dinner.

38:00.405 --> 38:03.040
I can just meet for dessert, or coffee...

38:03.074 --> 38:04.675
Please don't make this a thing.

38:04.742 --> 38:07.210
You met my neurotic mom.

38:07.245 --> 38:08.578
You met my Uncle Saul

38:08.613 --> 38:10.414
as he was gasping for his last breath.

38:10.448 --> 38:15.185
- You met my Aunt Gertie...
- Levi, I told you, they're critical.

38:15.253 --> 38:18.488
Newsflash... I know
how to take criticism.

38:18.523 --> 38:20.357
I've been doing it my whole life.

38:21.926 --> 38:25.062
If they think I'm not good
enough, I can deal with that.

38:25.096 --> 38:27.964
No, they're critical of me all the time,

38:27.999 --> 38:31.042
no matter what I do,
which is why I haven't told them.

38:33.404 --> 38:35.305
About me?

38:37.809 --> 38:39.209
That I'm gay.

38:41.346 --> 38:42.679
I haven't told them.

38:42.714 --> 38:44.514
Um...

38:44.549 --> 38:46.516
You... You called me a baby gay.

38:46.551 --> 38:48.618
You said that you wanted
no part in my shame spiral,

38:48.653 --> 38:50.973
- you said...
- I-I-I know... I know what I said. I...

38:54.158 --> 38:56.360
I have to go to dinner now.

38:56.494 --> 38:59.696
<i>A survey showed the
typical adult says "I'm fine"</i>

38:59.731 --> 39:01.365
<i>14 times a week...</i>

39:06.871 --> 39:10.340
<i>But less than 1 in 5 of them means it.</i>

39:10.475 --> 39:12.843
<i>Our default is to put on a brave face.</i>

39:12.877 --> 39:15.579
Have you heard from her at all?

39:15.613 --> 39:17.314
I'm really worried.

39:17.348 --> 39:21.785
Yeah, I'm... I'm...
I have heard from her.

39:21.819 --> 39:23.620
She's okay, Link.

39:23.688 --> 39:25.455
She's okay.

39:25.490 --> 39:27.891
She just doesn't want to talk to me.

39:27.959 --> 39:30.827
She just doesn't want to
tell me what the test said.

39:30.862 --> 39:32.129
She doesn't know what they are.

39:32.163 --> 39:33.507
She didn't pick up the test results.

39:33.531 --> 39:35.031
And I'm not going to.

39:37.802 --> 39:39.469
She was here.

39:39.504 --> 39:41.171
Sorry I lied.

39:41.205 --> 39:43.773
<i>But sometimes it's braver
to admit something's wrong.</i>

39:48.179 --> 39:50.414
I'm growing a whole human in my body,

39:50.481 --> 39:53.450
and I want to raise him with
someone who is gonna love him

39:53.484 --> 39:56.253
and me no matter what a blood test says.

39:58.356 --> 40:01.892
And it turns out that's my sisters.

40:03.528 --> 40:05.662
And I'm gonna be pushier
next time you're sad,

40:05.696 --> 40:07.297
because you were raised an only child,

40:07.365 --> 40:09.032
but you are not one anymore.

40:09.066 --> 40:12.536
You are everything that
I never knew I needed.

40:13.438 --> 40:15.405
- Amelia...
- Amelia.

40:18.042 --> 40:19.309
Go home, Link.

40:21.279 --> 40:22.904
We're over.

40:30.188 --> 40:32.389
I really think it's mostly
just the hormones.

40:32.457 --> 40:35.625
Does she plan on telling Owen
that the baby might be his?

40:35.660 --> 40:37.561
Doesn't seem like it.

40:37.595 --> 40:39.229
Okay.

40:39.297 --> 40:40.564
Um, I...

40:53.578 --> 40:55.512
<i>Because pretending everything's fine</i>

40:55.580 --> 40:57.714
<i>eventually catches up to you.</i>

40:57.748 --> 41:00.450
I shouldn't have left
you alone in the woods.

41:00.485 --> 41:01.852
I shouldn't have walked away.

41:01.886 --> 41:03.887
I should not have done that.

41:03.955 --> 41:05.589
And I've owed you an apology

41:05.656 --> 41:09.192
that I've just been too proud to give.

41:09.227 --> 41:12.095
So I do apologize, Maggie.

41:13.931 --> 41:15.632
Plus, you were right. There were bears.

41:17.468 --> 41:18.902
Thank you.

41:18.970 --> 41:19.970
You're welcome.

41:50.034 --> 41:52.051
<i>And when it does...</i>

41:54.405 --> 41:56.083
<i>...you better hope you
can repair the damage</i>

41:56.107 --> 41:57.474
<i>that's already done.</i>
