WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:02.570
Hey, hey! Look alive.
Hey.

00:02.710 --> 00:04.166
All right, everybody.
We got this, Mark?

00:04.250 --> 00:05.285
All right.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.791
Watch this guy.
He swings a heaw bat.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.704
Oh...

00:12.090 --> 00:13.330
Hustle, Mark.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.636
Get the ball.

00:24.560 --> 00:25.766
Dad!

00:31.030 --> 00:32.019
Oh...

00:32.110 --> 00:34.101
Looks like you
had a rough night.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.407
Wow. You really know how
to make a girl feel good.
Thanks, Al.

00:36.490 --> 00:37.946
Hey, Carrie.
How you doin'?
Hey, Denny.

00:38.030 --> 00:39.440
Hey, you okay?

00:39.540 --> 00:41.440
You look a little...
I don't know.
You look a little tired.

00:41.580 --> 00:43.457
Okay, what is it
with you two?

00:43.540 --> 00:44.780
I went out last
night, okay?

00:44.920 --> 00:46.706
I went to bed a little late.
I never go out.

00:46.790 --> 00:48.917
It was one night
on the town.
No big deal.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.958
All right.
So, you know,
who's the luclq guy?

00:52.840 --> 00:53.966
No guy, Denny.

00:54.050 --> 00:56.632
Just me, Delina
and Wang Chung.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.711
Oh, wow. Okay,
who is Wang Chung?

00:58.800 --> 00:59.960
Don't get yourself
worked up.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.842
Wang Chung is
a band from the '805.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.096
Karaoke?
Exactly.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.430
Oh, well,
in that case,

01:06.520 --> 01:08.147
I would love to Wang
Chung you and Delina.

01:08.270 --> 01:10.318
You know Denny,
I don't doubt
that for a second.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.395
What do we got, Al?

01:11.480 --> 01:14.278
Davis Bennett,
second-year student
at Manhattan Conservatory.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.520
Right in here.

01:15.650 --> 01:17.527
DENNY: Very prestigious
music school.

01:18.490 --> 01:21.618
AL: Took one to the chest.
No shell casings.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.497
Talked to the CSI guys.

01:23.620 --> 01:25.156
So far we assume
he was shot somewhere else.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.495
Dumped here.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.167
What about
security cameras?

01:28.290 --> 01:30.030
Nope.None
in this area.

01:30.170 --> 01:31.455
He's just a baby.

01:53.110 --> 01:55.146
JAY: Take a look, Al.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.196
Hey, boys,
where's Carrie?
With Delina.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.810
Getting Davis'
autopsy results.

01:58.910 --> 01:59.945
Really?

02:00.030 --> 02:01.361
You know, I should
probably go help them.

02:01.490 --> 02:04.038
Or you could stay here
and get caught up to speed.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.826
Jay.
All right.

02:06.330 --> 02:09.117
Meet Davis Bennett,
20 years old,
from Allentown, Pennsylvania.

02:09.210 --> 02:12.202
First year trumpet
in Manhattan
Conservatory studio band.

02:12.550 --> 02:14.199
Kid was good.
JAY: And I've been
combing through

02:14.300 --> 02:16.120
his credit cards,
phone records
and emails.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.619
There's nothing
suspicious there.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.119
Where was Davis
last seen alive?

02:19.220 --> 02:22.553
Leaving studio band
practice at 10:30 pm.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.596
Carrie and I will
head over to the school.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.267
Who runs the studio
band over there?

02:26.390 --> 02:29.018
Let's see.
The catalog
says a Leo Hackett.

02:29.100 --> 02:31.398
Hackett's at
Manhattan Conservatory?

02:31.480 --> 02:33.607
You know him?
Yeah, he...

02:34.320 --> 02:36.276
He taught me how
to play the trumpet.
Oh.

02:37.070 --> 02:38.059
What?

02:38.200 --> 02:39.906
You two never wanted to
be anything but cops?

02:40.030 --> 02:41.236
Always wanted
to be a cop.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.901
Had a Miami Vice
backpack in school.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.657
I dabbled in
animal husbandry.

02:44.740 --> 02:45.820
Animal husbandry?

02:45.910 --> 02:46.899
What?

02:47.080 --> 02:48.570
My uncle owned a farm.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.240
I'm sorry.
You were talking
about your trumpet.

02:51.830 --> 02:53.627
I was talking about
the case, all right?

02:53.750 --> 02:55.547
Leo_ Hackett was
teaching Jazz studies

02:55.630 --> 02:57.006
at Ithaca
when I was there.

02:57.090 --> 02:58.079
This guy?

02:59.260 --> 03:01.000
Can you play
any Kenny G?

03:01.090 --> 03:02.296
No, I mean it.

03:02.430 --> 03:04.341
That... That guy's...
We're done
talking here.

03:04.430 --> 03:06.762
What? I'm being serious.
It was a compliment.

03:06.850 --> 03:08.590
Kenny G?
He's a fantastic artist.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.681
Very smooth.

03:10.770 --> 03:11.839
CARRIE: Good morning.

03:11.980 --> 03:13.106
DELINA: What a night.

03:13.650 --> 03:16.528
I was so hung over.
Oh, my God.

03:16.610 --> 03:17.679
I wanna do it
again by the way.

03:17.820 --> 03:18.809
Yes.

03:18.940 --> 03:19.941
Yes.

03:20.070 --> 03:21.059
Um...

03:21.280 --> 03:22.907
Davis Bennett.
What do we got?

03:23.200 --> 03:25.020
Poor kid.
Let me show you.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.826
So, stippling
around the wound

03:27.950 --> 03:29.952
suggests he was
shot at close range.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.076
A medium
caliber handgun.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.489
Possibly a .38.

03:33.790 --> 03:34.779
And based on his rigor,

03:34.880 --> 03:36.791
he died between 2:00
and 3:00 am. this morning.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.002
What about
his toxicology?

03:39.130 --> 03:43.089
Traces of Provigil,
a drug used
for narcoleptics.

03:43.180 --> 03:44.795
Was he narcoleptic?

03:44.890 --> 03:46.096
No.

03:46.180 --> 03:47.716
So, what's a kid
like Davis doing

03:47.810 --> 03:49.596
with a drug used
for narcoleptics?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.557
Well, some colleges...
The kids,

03:51.640 --> 03:53.767
the over-achievers,
they use it to

03:53.850 --> 03:56.762
have laser-like focus
for hours on end.

03:56.860 --> 03:59.226
Yeah. I guess
it'll help a musician,

03:59.320 --> 04:01.641
_ _ but is it worth
kIllIng someone over?

04:08.290 --> 04:10.611
Why didn't you
ever tell me you
were a jazz player?

04:10.700 --> 04:13.419
This coming from the
person who never told
me she was married?

04:13.500 --> 04:14.740
But it's different.

04:14.830 --> 04:16.331
Why?
Because it's me.

04:16.460 --> 04:18.587
And besides,
playing the trumpet?

04:18.670 --> 04:20.001
It's not exactly
a chick magnet.

04:20.090 --> 04:22.331
I know. You always went
for the lead guitar player.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.461
Actually,
the drummer.

04:25.220 --> 04:26.505
Hey.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.806
All right,
what do you got?

04:27.890 --> 04:30.051
MAN: There's a girl
next door...

04:53.790 --> 04:56.668
Hey, there's a girl out here.
She lives next door.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.206
Apparently, she
heard Davis arguing

04:58.340 --> 04:59.739
with someone _on
the phone last night.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.370
I'm gonna talk to her.

05:01.460 --> 05:02.711
Okay.

05:08.930 --> 05:11.216
You heard Davis arguing
on the phone last night?

05:11.350 --> 05:12.590
Yes.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.266
You know who he
was arguing with?

05:14.390 --> 05:16.722
No, sorry.
I just heard
Davis getting upset.

05:16.810 --> 05:18.050
I don't know what
he was talking about.

05:18.150 --> 05:20.015
Is there anyone
_ Davis was _
havmg problems With?

05:20.110 --> 05:21.600
I had one
class with him.

05:21.730 --> 05:23.732
It's not like
we really talked.

05:23.820 --> 05:25.356
Can I go now?
I'm late for rehearsal.

05:25.740 --> 05:27.526
I thought the teachers
gave you the day off.

05:27.610 --> 05:29.521
They did in case
we want to talk
to a counselor

05:29.620 --> 05:30.575
or grieve or something.

05:30.700 --> 05:31.780
And you don't want to.

05:31.910 --> 05:34.037
It's not that.
I feel bad and everything.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.827
It's just,
I can't risk _
losmg my chaIr.

05:37.580 --> 05:38.569
Can I go now?

05:39.250 --> 05:40.660
Yeah, sure.

05:45.090 --> 05:48.048
Mark Overton's
finger work is solid.

05:48.220 --> 05:50.711
I had forgotten
what this place is like.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.803
I mean, these kids
prioritize music
over everything.

05:53.930 --> 05:55.841
It's kill
or be killed.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.469
Uh...

05:57.600 --> 06:00.558
Look at all the greats
who guest lecture here.

06:00.650 --> 06:03.141
CARRIE: I would be
impressed, but jazz,
it's not my thing.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.349
I know.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.600
Bon Jovi...

06:05.740 --> 06:08.277
Al "18 Carrot" Burns.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.275
It‘s been
a long time, brother.

06:11.780 --> 06:12.906
18 Carrot

06:12.990 --> 06:14.491
Hey, I'm Carrie.
Al's partner.

06:14.620 --> 06:16.576
A pleasure to
meet you, Carrie.
I'm Leo.

06:16.660 --> 06:17.911
He was my mentor.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.206
Well, A| here
was all heart, man.

06:19.290 --> 06:21.588
Full throttle
every time he played.

06:21.670 --> 06:23.831
Always had a problem
with his fingering.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.079
Don't.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.546
Well, look at you.

06:27.630 --> 06:29.837
A cop now. A lieutenant.

06:29.970 --> 06:33.462
I'm sorry we're reconnecting
_ under such sad
Circumstances, Leo.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.630
Poor kid. You know, we...

06:36.600 --> 06:38.761
It hurts to lose
a talent like Davis.

06:38.850 --> 06:40.806
Seems like you're
the only one
who cares around here.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.222
Music school culture,
and particularly
this music school,

06:44.320 --> 06:46.641
pretty cutthroat
especially this time of year.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.196
Westford Jazz Festival.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.730
Well, it's where
the best meets the best.

06:49.820 --> 06:51.230
It's where you get noticed.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.652
As you know,
Al, if you don't get
noticed in this business,

06:53.740 --> 06:55.651
you can kiss
your future goodbye.

06:55.740 --> 06:56.900
I mean, look at me.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.155
Oh, come on, Leo.

06:58.290 --> 07:01.327
You're in a top music school,
you're teaching
future legends.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.741
Still a glass-half-full
kinda guy, huh?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.455
Good to see some
things don't change.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.418
Listen, Davis was last
seen leaving your
studio band practice.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.711
Okay if we talk
to the students?

07:11.930 --> 07:12.919
Sure.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.687
Everyone, listen up,
please.

07:21.770 --> 07:24.147
We have Lieutenant Burns
and Detective Wells.

07:24.230 --> 07:25.936
They're gonna ask you
guys a few questions.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.020
Whose sheet music is that?

07:33.160 --> 07:34.229
Matt Wexler.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.519
He's your new
first

07:35.620 --> 07:36.689
Yes.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.189
Uh-huh.
Where is Matt now?

07:38.330 --> 07:39.706
He's over there.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.589
Ah!

07:58.140 --> 07:59.550
First-year trumpeter,
Matt Wexler

07:59.680 --> 08:01.762
meet all-star quarterback,
A! Burns.

08:03.730 --> 08:06.608
I hate to break it to you,
but you're screwed, bro.

08:06.730 --> 08:07.970
Man, I didn't
do anything.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.732
Sure you did.
You ran.

08:10.820 --> 08:12.060
Come on.

08:12.150 --> 08:14.311
And then there's
the matter of these.

08:17.450 --> 08:18.860
They fell out
of your backpack.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.111
You're the _dea|er_that
gave DaVIs Prowgll.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.365
And we checked
your cell phone records

08:23.460 --> 08:24.745
because it's
something we can do.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.416
And we know.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.496
You're the person
he was arguing with.

08:28.590 --> 08:30.205
Fighting with on the
phone at 7:00 pm,

08:30.300 --> 08:31.460
the night before he died.

08:31.590 --> 08:32.625
It's not what you think.

08:32.760 --> 08:33.795
I disagree, Mattie.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.750
I disagree.
I'll tell you why.

08:36.890 --> 08:39.256
Now that Davis is
out of the picture,
who's first chair?

08:40.220 --> 08:41.266
You.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.516
You took_the kid
out just In tIme

08:42.600 --> 08:43.635
to get noticed
at Lincoln Center?

08:43.770 --> 08:45.431
Was I jealous?

08:45.560 --> 08:46.640
Yeah.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.975
Did I occasionally wish
that Davis would drop dead

08:49.110 --> 08:51.396
so I could be
first chair? Sure.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.446
But I mean any second chair
has had thoughts like that.

08:53.530 --> 08:54.599
But they didn't
act on them.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.769
Hey, I didn't kill him.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.985
Miles never_
would've shot Mingus

09:01.120 --> 09:02.781
no matter how
heated shit got.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.325
Yeah, but you
lost me there, kid.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.109
We were composing together.

09:06.750 --> 09:09.708
That's what
the fight was about.
A song we were working on.

09:10.460 --> 09:13.338
_ _Davis was_
Ignoring all my ideas,
nothing new.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.836
He had such
a big-ass ego.

09:16.970 --> 09:18.210
So things got contentious.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.460
All right.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.636
Well, if he was
such a prick,

09:21.770 --> 09:22.714
why work with him?

09:25.810 --> 09:26.890
He was a genius.

09:26.980 --> 09:27.969
That's pretty high
praise for someone

09:28.110 --> 09:29.225
you occasionally
wished was dead.

09:29.310 --> 09:31.471
It made me
a better player.

09:34.820 --> 09:36.196
I'm gonna miss him.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.481
Well, then give
us something, Mattie.

09:42.410 --> 09:45.322
It'd go a long
way to helping us
forget about these.

09:47.460 --> 09:49.166
Davis was having issues
with the teacher.

09:49.460 --> 09:50.529
Okay.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.331
What kind of issues?

09:52.670 --> 09:55.047
Something shady
was going on.

09:55.630 --> 09:58.258
Anytime I ask Davis about it,
he'd clam up.

09:58.340 --> 09:59.796
This teacher got a name?

10:00.850 --> 10:01.919
Leo Hackett.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.761
All right.
So, we're looking at Leo.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.182
Anything to rule him
out as a suspect?

10:11.310 --> 10:12.641
I'm sorry, boss.

10:12.730 --> 10:15.187
I know this guy was
kind of a mentor to you.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.026
See what you can
find on him, Jay.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.902
Okay. Well...

10:19.610 --> 10:22.522
Ten consecutive wins
at the New Orleans
College Jazz Festival

10:22.620 --> 10:24.406
and three "Teacher
of the Year" awards.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.656
And 25 years of
looking after students.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.036
Doesn't seem like
a guy who suddenly
flies off the handle

10:29.170 --> 10:30.376
and shoots one of them.

10:30.460 --> 10:31.700
But that's where
the good stuff ends.

10:34.420 --> 10:37.412
There've been
complaints by students
citing verbal abuse.

10:37.550 --> 10:39.370
Kids today are too soft.

10:39.510 --> 10:40.670
So, Leo yells.

10:40.760 --> 10:41.886
He yelled at me.

10:41.970 --> 10:43.130
I was a better
player for it.

10:43.220 --> 10:46.474
Some of the students
also complained of
psychological trauma,

10:46.560 --> 10:49.222
resulting from
Leo's violent temper.

10:49.310 --> 10:51.392
Trauma? That sounds
trumped up to me.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.930
I don't know, boss.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.059
Check this.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.732
Manhattan Conservatory's
maintenance records.

10:57.860 --> 11:00.738
They got guys fixing
something that Leo's damaged

11:00.860 --> 11:02.612
in that studio
every other week.

11:02.740 --> 11:05.732
Holes in the wall.
Broken chairs,
music stands.

11:05.870 --> 11:08.327
Did this guy destroy
things when you were
playing with him?

11:08.410 --> 11:10.867
Sometimes Leo's passion
would get the best of him.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.496
That doesn't
make him a killer.

11:12.580 --> 11:14.662
He's a got a string
of assault charges, Al.

11:16.460 --> 11:19.759
He put two guys
he used to perform
with in the hospital.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.292
Got into fights with them
after the performance.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.096
And then there's this.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.426
JAY: Leo owns a .38, Al.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.892
Same caliber gun
used to shoot Davis.

11:33.270 --> 11:34.555
I'll talk to him.

11:34.650 --> 11:37.107
You want me
to call Carrie?
Alone! Thanks, Jay.

11:42.610 --> 11:43.941
What the
hell is this?

11:44.070 --> 11:48.074
Leo, we just need
to do a ballistics
test on your gun.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.031
What if I say no?

11:50.120 --> 11:51.405
We're past that.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.281
It's a warrant to
search your place.

11:55.380 --> 11:56.950
Unis are already there.

11:57.090 --> 11:58.796
You think I shot him?

11:59.010 --> 12:00.659
Oh, screw you, Al!

12:00.800 --> 12:03.587
My gun is locked in
a case where I left it.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.808
Then I'm sure
I'll get a call any
second to confirm that.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.380
Speak of the devil.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.475
Lieutenant Burns.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.682
What's the combination
on your gun case?

12:20.320 --> 12:22.140
12-bar blues
chord progression.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.196
One, four,
five, one.

12:33.370 --> 12:34.496
What's wrong?

12:36.330 --> 12:38.161
It's not in the case.

12:40.210 --> 12:41.336
Does Leo _
have an alibi?

12:41.460 --> 12:42.506
Not a good one.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.831
He says he
was home alone.

12:45.220 --> 12:46.505
LEO: Till you asked
me for my gun,

12:46.600 --> 12:47.749
I didn't even_
know it was missmg.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.171
So what, Leo?
Someone took it?

12:50.310 --> 12:51.675
They'd have to
know you had a gun.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.840
They'd have to know
your combination.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.017
I probably should've
come up with something
better than that.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.476
I mean...

12:57.560 --> 12:58.811
One, four, five, one.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.357
Everyone knows that
that's my chord progression.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.607
Well, you remember
our place in Ithaca.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.817
Students, friends,
everybody was dropping by
all the time to jam.

13:06.910 --> 13:09.731
Well, at my place
it's the same today.

13:09.870 --> 13:12.031
Anyone who came by
could've taken it.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.452
I don't remember
you having a gun back then.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.037
I also don't remember
you beating the
shit out of people.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.791
I lose my
temper sometimes.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.758
I have my demons
just like everybody else.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.043
But you seriously don't
think that I shot Davis?

13:51.740 --> 13:53.696
Jay, push in on
that cocktail napkin.

13:53.790 --> 13:54.950
Sure.

14:05.630 --> 14:09.293
I saw that exact
logo on a matchbook
in Davis' dorm room.

14:09.430 --> 14:10.419
Where's it from?

14:10.550 --> 14:11.539
I'm on it. I'm on it.

14:11.640 --> 14:12.846
Yeah, God,
you're brilliant.

14:12.930 --> 14:14.921
I just...
I never get tired
of watching you work.

14:15.060 --> 14:16.175
I don't know.
Thank you.

14:16.270 --> 14:17.339
He was talking to me.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.475
DENNY:
I was.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.395
He's stonewalling.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.515
Well, I got something.

14:23.650 --> 14:26.107
Leo's napkin's from
a hidden underground
club in the Bronx

14:26.240 --> 14:28.105
called "The Drunken Rabbit",
owned by...

14:29.320 --> 14:30.309
...Marko Vrioni.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.269
DENNY: Vrioni?

14:32.410 --> 14:34.196
I know this guy
from back in my
organized crime days.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.780
He's got ties to
the Albanian mafia.

14:35.870 --> 14:38.782
JAY: It looks like
_ Vrio_ni's involved
in multiple enterprises.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.161
Nightclubs, racketeering,
drug trafficking,

14:41.290 --> 14:43.451
and he's also big time
into racehorses.
Ooh!

14:43.550 --> 14:45.666
Owns a box
over at Aqueduct.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.427
AL: Start talking
about The Drunken Rabbit.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.629
What was Davis
doing in a club

14:54.720 --> 14:55.960
run by an
Albanian gangster?

14:56.310 --> 14:57.299
I don't know.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.058
We know Davis_ is
connected to it
and now we know you are.

15:03.650 --> 15:04.639
You're right.

15:05.860 --> 15:08.567
I got Davis to
play gigs there.

15:08.650 --> 15:10.481
Playing for a
nightline crowd

15:10.570 --> 15:13.368
is _an invaluable
experience for a young
musician like Davis.

15:13.490 --> 15:15.651
There are plenty
of jazz clubs
in New York.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.156
Why push Davis to play
for a bunch of thugs?

15:18.830 --> 15:20.366
They pay the best.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.490
You were taking a cut,
weren't you?

15:25.670 --> 15:26.955
How much?

15:28.670 --> 15:29.659
700/0.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.056
What happened to you?

15:38.020 --> 15:40.432
Alimony payments
from two divorces.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.761
Well, they don't
pay themselves and...

15:42.850 --> 15:44.351
Offers for gigs
of my own?

15:44.480 --> 15:46.016
They've been drying up
for the past few years.

15:46.110 --> 15:50.069
My life didn't
turn out exactly
the way I planned it.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.691
So, what?
Davis finally
refused to play.

15:52.780 --> 15:54.862
Maybe he threatened
to expose you
and you shot back.

15:54.950 --> 15:55.939
I didn't shoot him.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.076
Then you tell
me who did.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.498
I don't know.
That is not good enough!

16:04.210 --> 16:07.668
You have a string of assaults
and your gun is missing.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.376
A jury is going
to look at that,

16:09.460 --> 16:12.088
along with the money
you were taking from him?

16:12.220 --> 16:15.132
And they will draw
their own conclusion.

16:15.890 --> 16:18.882
Leo, you gotta
give me something,

16:19.020 --> 16:21.011
or you're going away
for Davis' murder.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.134
Okay.

16:24.560 --> 16:25.549
Uh...

16:27.020 --> 16:29.432
Davis played
a midnight set,

16:29.570 --> 16:32.482
at The Drunken Rabbit
the night he died.

16:32.570 --> 16:35.562
Was Davis having problems
with anyone at that club?

16:35.700 --> 16:36.735
I don't know. I...

16:37.700 --> 16:40.749
I would just give
him the password
and then they'd let him in.

16:41.540 --> 16:42.905
We're gonna
need that password.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.070
I don't know.
They change
it every night.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.456
Give me some
of the passwords.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.739
Blue Moon.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.250
Papa's Got
a Brand New Bag.

16:51.590 --> 16:52.716
Song titles.

17:03.350 --> 17:06.012
Passwords aren't
song titles.
DENNY: Hmm?

17:06.100 --> 17:07.601
They're racehorses.

17:07.900 --> 17:09.265
Wait, how do you...
How do you know that one?

17:09.360 --> 17:11.567
Marko's not the only one
who likes to play the ponies.

17:11.650 --> 17:13.982
Listen, the passwords
are the Aqueduct winners

17:14.110 --> 17:15.941
of the ninth race
of the past four Saturdays.

17:16.030 --> 17:18.521
And I know
tonight's password.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.941
Jay, pull up
that security footage
from outside the club,

17:21.080 --> 17:22.695
the night Davis
was killed.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.610
Got it right here.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.160
There goes
Davis at 2:05.

17:26.290 --> 17:28.326
You know what that means.
This kid must've
gotten shot like,

17:28.460 --> 17:30.371
shortly after that.
Like 2:30 in the morning.

17:30.460 --> 17:31.700
The guy looks like
he's on a mission.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.540
So, all we have to do
is go down to the club,

17:33.630 --> 17:35.791
talk to them,
and find out
where he was going.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.421
No one in a place like
this is gonna wanna
talk to a couple of cops.

17:38.510 --> 17:40.592
Well, who said anything
about going as cops?

17:57.660 --> 17:58.649
Password?

17:58.780 --> 18:01.157
Tequila Jack.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.822
Should've bet on him.
I would've got the pick 6.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.326
Gotta deal with her
for a second, buddy.

18:05.410 --> 18:06.707
I get it all day.

18:06.830 --> 18:08.366
And he loves it.

18:13.300 --> 18:17.259
WOMAN:
You and I

18:19.220 --> 18:24.715
Are just like
a couple of tots

18:26.020 --> 18:30.798
Running through the meadow

18:32.320 --> 18:37.769
Pickin' up lots
of forget-me-nots

18:39.320 --> 18:43.279
You made me feel so young

18:45.910 --> 18:51.530
You make me feel
there are songs to be sung

18:51.880 --> 18:54.371
Bells to be rung

18:54.500 --> 19:00.257
And a wonderful
fling to be flung

19:01.720 --> 19:09.183
You made me feel so young

19:26.660 --> 19:28.150
We'll be back in a few.

19:29.370 --> 19:30.780
I'm gonna talk
to the singer.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.319
Yeah, I bet you will.

19:32.420 --> 19:33.455
I'm gonna go talk to...

19:33.590 --> 19:34.909
I know.
The drummer.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.410
Knock yourself out.

19:42.090 --> 19:43.170
Gorgeous.

19:44.430 --> 19:45.499
Excuse me?

19:45.600 --> 19:46.919
Your take on
that last song.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.096
Oh. Thank you.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.380
Yeah. Playing it in B-flat.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.799
That's triclq to pull off.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.219
You know your jazz.

19:54.310 --> 19:56.141
I'm a talent
scout from Chicago.

19:56.270 --> 19:58.682
You have a name,
"Talent scout from Chicago"?

19:59.860 --> 20:01.145
Stella.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.019
I was standing
here the other night

20:03.110 --> 20:05.112
and I heard this
amazing trumpet player.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.189
Mmm.

20:06.780 --> 20:08.236
Davis Bennett.

20:08.330 --> 20:10.070
He's our biggest draw.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.536
Especially with the ladies.

20:12.290 --> 20:13.746
You haven't heard?

20:13.830 --> 20:14.956
Bennett's dead.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.627
He died night
before last.

20:16.710 --> 20:18.086
Oh, my God.

20:19.210 --> 20:20.416
What happened?

20:20.920 --> 20:22.126
Look,
you are gorgeous.

20:22.260 --> 20:23.215
Well, thank you.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.790
And cool.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.097
I'd love to hear more
about your label.

20:27.180 --> 20:29.057
Well, you're a very
talented drummer.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.131
Do you like to mix
business with pleasure?

20:31.930 --> 20:33.386
How about your boyfriend?

20:33.480 --> 20:34.799
Him? No.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.470
No, he's not my boyfriend.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.816
My friend.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.642
Look at...
He's flirting up a storm
with your lead singer.

20:40.780 --> 20:41.815
Yeah, Stella.

20:41.940 --> 20:42.986
That's the boss' girl.

20:43.110 --> 20:46.022
Ah...
And Marko is not somebody
you wanna piss off.

20:46.160 --> 20:49.368
What's it like working
with the boss' girlfriend?

20:49.490 --> 20:51.401
She can do
whatever she wants.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.569
Like tonight.

20:52.660 --> 20:55.379
She changed the
arrangement to a song
right before we played it.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.489
Well, you know what?

20:56.580 --> 20:58.457
You're such a good drummer,
I didn't even know.

20:58.540 --> 20:59.950
Well, thank you.

21:02.260 --> 21:03.249
Hey, Marko.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.881
I'm Marko Vrioni.

21:07.010 --> 21:08.716
Raquel Scott.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.216
Why don't you
join me in my office
for a private drink?

21:11.350 --> 21:13.261
Sure, I like private.

21:13.350 --> 21:14.806
Don't go anywhere.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.671
So, tell me.

21:45.760 --> 21:49.298
What are you
really doing here,
Raquel Scott?

21:51.060 --> 21:53.460
I'm listening
to music, right?

21:53.560 --> 21:57.223
I mean I know
that's a crazy thing
to do in a jazz club.

21:57.310 --> 21:59.471
But I'm a record executive
out of Chicago.

21:59.560 --> 22:00.720
Devin Schurtzer,
you know him?

22:02.020 --> 22:03.180
Never heard of him.
CARRIE: Really?

22:03.280 --> 22:04.395
'Cause he's heard of you.

22:04.530 --> 22:08.899
In fact, he says you
get the best young
artists to play here

22:08.990 --> 22:11.322
before they play
anywhere else in the city.

22:11.490 --> 22:13.822
Glad my reputation's
made it out to Chicago.

22:13.910 --> 22:17.494
We're interested in an_artist.
We hear he's speCIal.

22:17.580 --> 22:19.127
He plays here,
Davis Bennett.

22:22.630 --> 22:25.872
Again,
why are you here?

22:25.970 --> 22:28.211
I'm a record exec_utive.
I mean I'm gomg
to a bunch of clubs.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.710
This isn't the only one.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.631
We're actually looking
to sign a few artists.

22:31.760 --> 22:32.749
Like who?

22:34.100 --> 22:37.183
Mark Overton's
finger work is solid.

22:37.270 --> 22:38.760
But he's overrated.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.396
MAN: I saw him last
week at the Vanguard.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.856
That stuff's so derivative.

22:43.980 --> 22:45.140
Well, there's
Mark Overton,

22:45.280 --> 22:46.429
he's playing
at the Vanguard
Thursday nights.

22:46.530 --> 22:47.940
So, I'm gonna go
take in his show.

22:48.070 --> 22:49.731
And then there's
Mel Flower and Babkin.

22:49.820 --> 22:51.196
They're playing at
The Stone Saturday night.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.269
I'm gonna go see them.

22:52.410 --> 22:53.616
They're blowing up,
we wanna sign 'em.

22:53.700 --> 22:54.689
You wanna join me?

22:55.950 --> 22:58.362
Davis Bennett
isn't playing tonight.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.665
Really?

22:59.790 --> 23:00.779
Mmm.

23:03.460 --> 23:05.451
You can take her
back to the bar.

23:16.140 --> 23:17.801
Whatever happened
to our private drink?

23:17.930 --> 23:19.807
Oh, Kenny will set you up.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.316
Don't turn around.
We're being watched.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.896
I have a clue.

23:28.990 --> 23:29.979
Wanna dance?

23:30.070 --> 23:31.059
You don't dance.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.310
I do now,
let's make it convincing.
Oh.

23:34.740 --> 23:37.243
I see you're starting
to feel the music, huh?

23:37.330 --> 23:39.036
Just go with it.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.957
Okay, there's a
guy behind you.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.665
See him?
Yeah.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.588
_There's a button
missmg on his jacket.

23:46.670 --> 23:49.628
I saw the exact _
same button at DaVIS
Bennett's crime scene.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.928
That places him at the lot
where Davis was dumped.

23:53.470 --> 23:55.006
But it doesn't
prove he's a killer.

23:55.140 --> 23:56.346
Good point.

23:57.720 --> 24:01.508
Well, maybe instead
of blowing our cover tonight,

24:01.600 --> 24:04.262
we should have our guys
go pay him a visit tomorrow.

24:04.770 --> 24:05.850
Yes.

24:06.730 --> 24:08.812
You ready to
get out of here?

24:08.900 --> 24:09.935
Sure.

24:10.030 --> 24:12.692
Especially since
you've been flirting
with Marko's girlfriend.

24:12.780 --> 24:14.736
Oh...
I was not flirting.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.019
Oh, yes, you were.

24:16.370 --> 24:18.156
Take me home now.

24:18.540 --> 24:19.996
I would love to.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.626
Rogen
RaqueL

24:31.880 --> 24:33.928
Sorry about
detaining you overnight.

24:34.050 --> 24:36.041
You're just doing your job.

24:36.390 --> 24:40.383
And I've seen worse.
The drunk tank,
New Orleans Jazz Fest.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.009
Look”.

24:46.980 --> 24:48.857
...this kid Davis, man.

24:49.860 --> 24:51.020
He was the real deal.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.731
We'll find his killer.

24:57.910 --> 24:59.821
All right,
go ahead and ask me.

24:59.910 --> 25:01.070
Ask you what?

25:01.200 --> 25:04.078
If giving up jazz
was the right
thing for you to do.

25:04.210 --> 25:07.247
You've been asking
yourself that same
question for 25 years.

25:07.380 --> 25:11.419
No, you said it yourself.
I never had the chops.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.080
Chops you can learn.

25:14.260 --> 25:15.750
You had heart.

25:17.350 --> 25:19.250
You never told me that
when I was your student.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.591
Well, you know me.

25:22.350 --> 25:23.476
That's not how I do it.

25:24.140 --> 25:25.937
Maybe it's not
too late to start.

25:26.770 --> 25:28.260
I'll give that
some thought.

25:38.950 --> 25:42.363
So, these are all the guys
who work for Marko.

25:42.620 --> 25:45.862
That's him, uh,
scar on his cheek.
Who's he?

25:45.960 --> 25:47.279
Here we go.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.786
Alec Hyka came to
the States in '97.

25:50.170 --> 25:51.956
He's been racking up
arrests ever since

25:52.050 --> 25:54.462
and busted for
drug trafficking,
arms dealing, assault.

25:54.550 --> 25:56.336
It doesn't seem_ like
he's done any time.

25:56.470 --> 25:58.836
With a rap sheet
like that? Come on.

25:58.970 --> 26:00.597
Looks like Marko's
attorney always manages

26:00.680 --> 26:02.591
to get the charges
against Alec dropped.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.171
A lot of shady characters
in the club last night.

26:05.310 --> 26:08.143
Maybe Davis saw
Alec do something
he wasn't supposed to.

26:08.230 --> 26:09.470
Alec had to
take him out.

26:09.610 --> 26:10.816
What's Alec's address?

26:12.070 --> 26:14.857
712 Bogart Ave,
East Bronx, apartment 3A.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.309
You two, head over there.

26:18.450 --> 26:19.485
Hey.
Huh?

26:19.570 --> 26:21.572
You know,
Al's not the
only macho guy

26:21.660 --> 26:23.400
who explored
his artistic side.

26:23.490 --> 26:24.536
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

26:24.660 --> 26:27.117
A couple years ago
I dabbled in a little
ballroom dancing.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.825
To tell you the truth,
I had a hell of a tango.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.746
Is that right?
True story.

26:30.840 --> 26:31.875
You know,
if I'd stuck with it

26:32.000 --> 26:33.831
I'd probably be on that
dancing TV show, who knows?

26:33.920 --> 26:35.831
Yeah, no way
you're getting laid
with that one, Denny.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.005
What?

26:37.970 --> 26:39.710
Are you kidding me?
It works like a charm.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.546
My man,
ladies love to dance.

26:43.640 --> 26:44.959
JAY: Hey! Hey, you!

26:46.890 --> 26:48.096
Police!

27:15.710 --> 27:17.541
Holy shit.

27:18.090 --> 27:19.125
No.

27:21.260 --> 27:24.673
Okay, we know Alec
_ was at Davis'
crime scene, right?

27:24.760 --> 27:26.307
He's Marko's
hired muscle.

27:26.390 --> 27:28.176
So, chances are
he doesn't make a move

27:28.270 --> 27:29.680
without his
boss' say-so.

27:29.770 --> 27:31.260
We need more than that
to come after Marko.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.890
Carrie's right.
Look, I know these mob guys.

27:33.020 --> 27:33.975
All right?

27:34.070 --> 27:36.436
They come in there with their
thousand-dollar-an-hour
lawyers,

27:36.570 --> 27:38.731
sitting with
their smug-ass grins
on their face.

27:38.820 --> 27:40.947
You know, just like
daring you to arrest them.

27:41.070 --> 27:42.560
We need to get one
of Marko's people

27:42.700 --> 27:44.270
to break ranks,
give us something.

27:44.410 --> 27:46.401
Well, why don't you hit up
your girlfriend Stella.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.742
I mean, she's dating Marko.
She might know something.

27:48.830 --> 27:50.206
Hey, Lieu.

27:50.290 --> 27:51.609
You got a new girlfriend?
All right.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.160
That's a nice new necklace
you're wearing there, Denny.

27:53.750 --> 27:55.411
I've never seen you
wear that one before.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.952
Oh, yeah,
it's just a friend's.

27:58.090 --> 27:59.125
You're wearing
your friend's necklace?

27:59.260 --> 28:00.295
He means girlfriend.

28:00.420 --> 28:03.298
I mean,
it's not that defined yet.

28:03.430 --> 28:05.386
Defined enough that
you're wearing her necklace.

28:05.470 --> 28:07.176
She asked me
to wear it, okay?

28:07.260 --> 28:08.261
It's something about,
you know,

28:08.350 --> 28:10.090
making us feel closer
or something like that.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.970
Aww. ..
That's sweet.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.937
Al, you could take
a leaf out of his book.

28:15.020 --> 28:16.760
When we were dating,
you never wore
anything of mine

28:16.860 --> 28:18.020
except that one time
when you wore my thong.

28:18.440 --> 28:20.180
Okay, back to the case.

28:34.790 --> 28:36.451
There was a photo
in Davis' dorm room.

28:36.540 --> 28:37.700
He was wearing a necklace.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.587
Stella had the same necklace
at the club that night.

28:40.670 --> 28:42.297
Oh, you see?
Look, I'm not the only guy

28:42.380 --> 28:44.428
who shares necklaces
with his lady friends.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.046
Stella and Davis
had a thing.

28:46.140 --> 28:49.462
Your crush _Stella
was haVIng
an affair with Davis.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.221
She's not my crush, okay?

28:51.310 --> 28:53.722
I just liked her version of
You Make Me Feel So Young.

28:56.230 --> 29:02.271
STELLA:
'Cause you
make me feel so...

29:03.990 --> 29:09.280
You made me feel so...

29:10.120 --> 29:14.238
You made me feel

29:14.330 --> 29:18.334
So young...

29:20.050 --> 29:22.086
You made me
feel so young.

29:22.630 --> 29:25.463
You made me feel
so young, past tense.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.092
And the drummer
said that Stella
changed the arrangement

29:28.180 --> 29:29.886
right before
they went on stage.

29:30.510 --> 29:33.479
What if she was singing it
for her lover Davis?

29:33.770 --> 29:35.556
What if she was dedicating
that song to him

29:35.690 --> 29:37.897
because she
knew he was dead?

29:38.940 --> 29:40.180
I'm gonna talk to Stella.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.599
Oh. Hi.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.366
Roger, right?

29:48.450 --> 29:49.906
Kind of early
for tonight's show.

29:50.030 --> 29:51.531
You remember
my fake name.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.031
Lieutenant Burns, NYPD.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.035
What's this about?

29:58.170 --> 29:59.205
Davis Bennett.

30:01.460 --> 30:04.088
I liked you a lot better
as a record executive.

30:05.720 --> 30:06.755
Come on in.

30:09.550 --> 30:11.677
This is your dressing room?

30:12.720 --> 30:16.099
Welcome to
the high class world
of being a jazz singer.

30:17.140 --> 30:19.142
I know you and Davis
shared a necklace.

30:19.400 --> 30:20.970
Tell me what
else you shared.

30:21.070 --> 30:22.970
That's crazy.
I'm with Marko.

30:23.070 --> 30:25.231
All it takes is
one phone call, Stella.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.737
We can have crime
scene techs comb
through your apartment.

30:27.820 --> 30:30.402
They'll find Davis' prints.
They'll find his DNA.

30:36.330 --> 30:39.822
_ Davis and I started
seeing each other months ago.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.995
He was just a kid,

30:42.090 --> 30:45.253
but when he played,
he could be any age.

30:45.340 --> 30:46.796
It was jazz, you know.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.250
I had to get
close to that.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.466
I didn't mean to
break his heart.

30:51.930 --> 30:54.387
That's why
his plan took off.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.555
He was in love.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.767
I told him
we'd never work,

30:59.020 --> 31:00.806
but he believed
love always Wins.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.475
Who killed him?

31:04.320 --> 31:07.528
Stella, if Davis
meant anything to you,

31:07.610 --> 31:09.441
help us nail his killer.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.020
I can't.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.440
If he finds out
I even talked to you...

31:13.530 --> 31:14.940
If Marko finds out.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.780
He suspected
us for weeks.

31:24.130 --> 31:26.621
Ever_ since he saw us
talking after a show,

31:26.760 --> 31:28.296
he started
threatening me.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.967
Telling me to
stay away from him.

31:31.010 --> 31:33.797
I tried to tell Davis
you can't cross Marko.

31:33.930 --> 31:34.919
He's crazy.

31:36.140 --> 31:39.473
Two nights ago,
Davis followed me
home from the club.

31:40.890 --> 31:42.221
I let him up.

31:42.310 --> 31:44.471
I told him
we had to end it.

31:44.980 --> 31:47.357
But suddenly,
Marko appeared there
with two of his guys

31:47.480 --> 31:49.027
and he threatened
him and he told him

31:49.150 --> 31:50.481
never to come_
to the club again

31:50.990 --> 31:52.355
and never to talk to me.

31:52.990 --> 31:54.651
But Davis refused.

31:56.370 --> 31:59.248
I begged him
not to hurt him.

32:00.370 --> 32:01.826
I begged him.

32:03.040 --> 32:04.530
It's my fault.

32:05.340 --> 32:08.252
Marko shot him,
but it's my fault.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.842
Hang tight,
we got this.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.891
You gotta feel pretty
relieved that Leo's
in the clear, right?

32:27.020 --> 32:28.100
Iam.

32:28.530 --> 32:29.895
Stella holding up okay?

32:30.030 --> 32:31.145
Yeah, considering.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.980
She's pretty torn up
about everything.

32:33.070 --> 32:35.061
You know, if there's
one thing I learned
in high school, Al,

32:35.200 --> 32:37.407
is that star-crossed
love never ends well.

32:37.530 --> 32:39.407
You had a star
crossed love affair
in high school?

32:39.540 --> 32:42.247
No, me, no.
High school English,
Romeo and Juliet.

32:42.370 --> 32:43.530
I did okay in
high school, Al.

32:43.670 --> 32:44.819
Yeah, I'm sure.

32:45.580 --> 32:47.161
How's Denny doing?

32:47.250 --> 32:48.626
Well, he's just
getting started.

32:54.590 --> 32:55.579
Ah.

32:56.720 --> 32:59.177
Now, look, I am sorry
about what happened
to your boy Alec.

32:59.260 --> 33:01.387
There are plenty more
where he came from.

33:02.270 --> 33:03.259
Oh.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.016
You think you're
getting out of here,
don't you?

33:08.230 --> 33:10.357
I got your balls in a vice.

33:10.440 --> 33:11.737
Stella's neighbors
said they heard

33:11.820 --> 33:15.108
what they thought
was a car backfiring at
2:30 in the morning.

33:15.240 --> 33:16.480
But it wasn't a car.

33:17.240 --> 33:20.619
That was you,
firing a round
into Davis' chest.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.951
I had no
problem with that kid.

33:23.540 --> 33:27.032
Yeah, sure.
Until you caught
him nailing Stella.

33:28.130 --> 33:29.119
See, I imagine
a guy like you

33:29.250 --> 33:30.490
doesn't stand for some punk

33:30.590 --> 33:32.706
half his age giving
it to his girl, right?

33:32.840 --> 33:34.831
They were never together.

33:35.340 --> 33:38.093
That kid was stalking Stella.
He was obsessed with her.

33:38.220 --> 33:40.097
Marko, come on.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.466
You've heard
Stella sing, right?

33:42.930 --> 33:44.477
She can really
sell it, can't she?

33:44.600 --> 33:46.090
She wouldn't lie to me.

33:46.230 --> 33:47.185
No?

33:47.270 --> 33:48.760
You seem like
a generous guy.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.897
I am,
with people I like.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.566
Like Stella.

33:55.030 --> 33:56.156
See,

33:57.490 --> 33:59.060
we looked into it.

34:00.660 --> 34:01.615
You bought her a necklace.

34:01.740 --> 34:02.729
So what?

34:02.830 --> 34:03.865
So...

34:07.830 --> 34:08.956
She gave it to Davis

34:10.380 --> 34:12.336
and they'd been
seeing each other
for months.

34:16.800 --> 34:17.789
JAY: What?

34:18.090 --> 34:20.888
You see Marko's reaction?
He didn't know
about the affair.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.466
DENNY: Look at him.

34:23.140 --> 34:26.303
Doesn't he look happy?
Doesn't that make you mad?

34:28.270 --> 34:32.013
How 'bout you tell me
what you did with the gun

34:32.150 --> 34:33.469
after you shot Davis.

34:33.780 --> 34:35.099
We're done here.
Hey.

34:35.190 --> 34:37.146
Now, look, I think Mr. Vrioni
can decide for himself

34:37.280 --> 34:38.315
if he wants to cooperate.

34:38.450 --> 34:39.565
Here's why we're done.

34:40.030 --> 34:42.191
You've got your picture,
we've got ours.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.695
Take a look.

34:44.660 --> 34:47.151
Mr. Vrioni was at a restaurant
in Manhattan with Alec Hyka

34:47.290 --> 34:50.168
and 10 other
witnesses at 2:30 a.m.,
the night in question.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.431
I don't know,
maybe he gave it to
one of his thugs to do.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.977
I don't think Marko knew
about Davis and Stella.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.185
So then how'd it go down?

35:15.280 --> 35:17.396
The only person
who's admitted
to being with Davis

35:17.530 --> 35:20.567
at the time of
his death is Stella.

35:21.370 --> 35:22.359
Ah.

35:22.910 --> 35:24.025
I don't know,
why did she do it?

35:24.120 --> 35:26.247
And how did she
get his body out of
her place all by herself?

35:26.370 --> 35:28.031
They said Marko
didn't know about the affair.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.576
I think he did
know about the murder.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.115
So, what are
you thinking, Al?

35:36.710 --> 35:39.042
I think maybe
I give Stella a ride.

35:39.720 --> 35:40.960
You let Marko go?

35:41.090 --> 35:42.330
We had no choice.

35:42.430 --> 35:45.058
Without a confession,
we didn't have _
enough to arrest him.

35:45.180 --> 35:46.716
But what about
my statement?

35:47.140 --> 35:48.550
Your word against his.

35:50.020 --> 35:51.430
We need corroboration.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.551
But he's going know
I've ratted him out.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.856
And that you and
Davis were together.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.062
Oh, my God.
Al, he's gonna
come after me.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.697
He might.

36:02.740 --> 36:04.480
I'll see about
protection for you.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.229
You'll see about it?

36:06.830 --> 36:10.072
Look, there are other ways
you could protect yourself.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.616
You could amend
your statement.

36:11.750 --> 36:12.910
Maybe tell us
a little bit more

36:13.000 --> 36:14.831
about what happened that
night in your apartment.

36:16.670 --> 36:17.910
I have nothing
to say to you.

36:24.430 --> 36:25.920
If you change your mind.

37:10.930 --> 37:12.807
MARKO: Stella, it's me.

37:15.310 --> 37:16.937
My guys saw you come in.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.970
Open the door, Stella.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.981
Open the damn door, Stella.

37:34.500 --> 37:35.489
AL ON PHONE:
Hello?

37:35.580 --> 37:37.628
It's Stella. Marko's here.

37:37.710 --> 37:38.870
I'm on my way.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.160
Hurry up, please.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.949
He's outside
my dressmg room.

37:42.050 --> 37:45.542
Stella, calm down,
but listen to me.

37:46.340 --> 37:47.671
I'll get there
faster if you tell me

37:47.800 --> 37:49.381
what really
happened that night.

37:49.510 --> 37:52.388
What?
You son of a bitch.

37:53.810 --> 37:54.799
MARKO: Stella.

37:54.890 --> 37:55.879
Okay, okay.

37:58.480 --> 38:03.065
Davis came over _
and he was drunk and furious

38:03.190 --> 38:05.397
because I hadn't ended
things with Marko.

38:06.570 --> 38:08.777
And he said he was
going to go to the club

38:08.870 --> 38:09.859
and teach Marko a lesson...

38:09.990 --> 38:11.150
MARKO: Open
the door, Stella.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.743
And he had this gun
he said he took
from his teacher

38:13.870 --> 38:16.418
and I told him just
forget it, go home.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.706
She took the bait.
All right.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.792
Hey, Carrie's
a minute out.

38:23.590 --> 38:27.708
And just suddenly
we were fighting
over the gun and...

38:27.840 --> 38:29.216
It went off.

38:29.930 --> 38:34.139
And I tried to save him,
but there was
blood everywhere.

38:34.220 --> 38:35.676
It was too much.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.266
I panicked.
I called Marko.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.391
He came over with
his guys to clean up.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.389
MARKO: Stella.

38:43.480 --> 38:46.028
Oh, my God,
he's coming through.

38:46.110 --> 38:47.566
Hang on,
I'll be right there.

38:47.860 --> 38:50.067
MARKO: Open the
damn door, Stella.

39:13.930 --> 39:15.170
Drop your gun.

39:18.600 --> 39:19.680
How many cops out there?

39:20.100 --> 39:22.148
Enough to get you killed
if you try to run.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.639
Guess I need a shield.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.486
Listen.

39:27.150 --> 39:29.903
Stella, you don't
have to do this.

39:35.620 --> 39:36.780
Hey.

39:36.910 --> 39:38.571
Nice weapon of choice.
Thanks.

39:38.660 --> 39:41.208
You know,
I got a thing
for drummers.

39:56.850 --> 39:59.227
Gotta hand it to you, Marko,
decent performance.

39:59.310 --> 40:01.972
Could have
stuck to the script,
but not bad.

40:02.980 --> 40:05.437
I helped you.
Now you help me.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.646
We did help you.

40:07.190 --> 40:08.771
Proved you
didn't kill Davis.

40:10.650 --> 40:12.311
_ How about that_
immunity you promised?

40:12.450 --> 40:14.065
DENNY: I'm not
a lawyer, right,

40:14.160 --> 40:16.321
but isn't that immunity
from prosecution for murder?

40:16.450 --> 40:19.613
Yeah, see,
it doesn't include failing
to report a dead body.

40:19.700 --> 40:20.997
Tampering with
the physical evidence.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.075
Right, not to mention

40:22.170 --> 40:24.320
operating a bar music
venue without a license.

40:25.130 --> 40:26.836
Mmm. Ouch.

40:29.340 --> 40:31.331
Hey, what's up?
I'll buy you a drink.

40:31.470 --> 40:33.335
Sorry, hot date.

40:33.930 --> 40:35.841
With who

40:35.930 --> 40:38.592
Didn't they just walk
her out of here in
some NYPD

40:38.680 --> 40:42.013
You got a crime
scene to process,
I got plans.

40:44.190 --> 40:46.681
Hey, come on, Al.

40:47.730 --> 40:49.982
Come on, man,
it's gonna take
me hours, man.

41:25.020 --> 41:26.055
Well,

41:27.770 --> 41:29.351
to another happy ending.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.606
To another happy ending.

41:33.950 --> 41:34.939
Mmm...

41:41.540 --> 41:42.529
Oh.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.610
He really is good.

41:45.620 --> 41:47.247
Well, it's not
Wang Chung, but...

41:47.330 --> 41:50.242
Hey listen,
nobody is Wang Chung.

41:50.420 --> 41:52.001
I'm just saying.

41:56.550 --> 41:59.383
You know,
I think Davis
really did love Stella.

42:00.010 --> 42:03.594
Everyone says his
playing totally changed
two months ago.

42:05.100 --> 42:06.727
The power
of love, right?

42:07.440 --> 42:11.683
I mean, you definitely
became a much better
cop after you met me.

42:15.820 --> 42:17.276
Do you ever regret it?

42:18.110 --> 42:21.614
You know, the path you
took becoming a cop
and not a musician.

42:22.950 --> 42:24.190
Nah.

42:26.290 --> 42:29.032
I'm exactly where
I'm supposed to be.
