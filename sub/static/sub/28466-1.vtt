-[Vlad] All right.
-[woman] Great.

01:04.605 --> 01:08.777
[Vlad] Now, you know, right now,
you're working on television,

01:08.861 --> 01:09.945
you're working in film,

01:10.028 --> 01:13.448
you're working on your graphic novel
that's gonna come out soon.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.993
You have a lot of stuff
that you're busy with.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.746
But obviously you still look like
you're in a bodybuilding shape.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.957
With all the stuff happening
in your life right now, I mean,

01:22.040 --> 01:24.960
I know it's... do you find it challenging
to still maintain the physique?

01:26.461 --> 01:27.921
[Kai Greene] It's challenging,

01:28.005 --> 01:31.216
and I think it's also very, very clear,

01:31.300 --> 01:33.427
uh, that you can't do that.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.889
-It's not a maintenance thing.
-But if you didn't have the physique,

01:36.972 --> 01:38.807
do you think perception
of you would be diminished?

01:38.891 --> 01:42.311
Yeah. I used to think
it was bodybuilding, you know.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.480
But I've gotten a chance
to grow a little bit more,

01:45.564 --> 01:48.984
just, just by way of having
more opportunity

01:49.067 --> 01:53.197
to think a little deeper about it
and be exposed to a lot.

01:56.992 --> 01:57.826
[man groans]

02:00.913 --> 02:02.289
[chuckles]

02:04.041 --> 02:06.877
[Kai] When it comes to the individual
that's looking at you as a bodybuilder,

02:06.960 --> 02:10.797
a lot of times, it may be
that bodybuilding becomes the platform

02:10.881 --> 02:14.384
that makes the introduction,
but I think the thing that allows them

02:14.468 --> 02:17.638
to resonate well with you
is beyond bodybuilding.

02:18.472 --> 02:22.059
The thing that may encourage someone
most to want to pay attention

02:22.142 --> 02:25.437
to anything you have to say
has more to do with

02:25.521 --> 02:31.068
their ability to identify themselves
in you.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.694
That becomes everything.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.364
You know, 'cause without that,
then there's just sets and reps

02:35.447 --> 02:39.201
and how much can you bench
and how big is your chest versus this guy.

02:39.284 --> 02:42.955
But the things that are unique
to your personality,

02:43.038 --> 02:47.835
the struggles that are revealed
in, um, who you are,

02:48.544 --> 02:51.505
um, and how that reads on film
a lot of times,

02:51.588 --> 02:52.756
is the thing that...

02:54.466 --> 02:58.387
allows people to want
to take that journey with you.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.562

05:11.645 --> 05:14.940

05:17.234 --> 05:19.778
<i>Being involved in this industry</i>
<i>for the last few years,</i>

05:19.862 --> 05:21.488
<i>I often ask myself,</i>

05:21.572 --> 05:24.992
<i>do bodybuilding ideals</i>
<i>reflect the ideals of the mainstream?</i>

05:25.075 --> 05:26.660
How do you feel about bodybuilding?

05:27.536 --> 05:29.621
Uh, I don't have any thoughts
on bodybuilding.

05:29.705 --> 05:30.664
Nothing.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.834
It's not weightlifting,
it's actually shaping your body.

05:33.917 --> 05:34.793
It's awesome.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.212
I remember the comic books,
when we used to have

05:37.296 --> 05:39.798
the back pages of comic books,
Charles Atlas.

05:39.882 --> 05:45.262
I saw one on the train the other day
and they're just like bulky and big.

05:45.345 --> 05:49.641
Big guys, hard to make clothes for.
I don't know.

05:49.725 --> 05:52.978
You hear about the steroids,
you hear about what they eat

05:53.061 --> 05:54.354
and things like that.

05:54.438 --> 05:57.524
[Vlad] I want to show a couple images.
Let me know how you feel about these.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.359
I used to be like that. [chuckles]

05:59.443 --> 06:00.527
[man] That's bodybuilding.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.155
-I think of it as body sculpting.
-OK.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.073
They look good, they look in shape.

06:05.157 --> 06:08.952
They look like they're
a little bit, you know, too lean.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.871
You know, a little too ripped.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.372
That's how you pull the look.

06:12.456 --> 06:14.833
That guy has eight abs.
That one has six.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.460
That hasn't gone to the freakish yet.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.713
I mean, his head is smaller
than his body, but that's OK.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.465
I mean, if he's happy with it...

06:21.548 --> 06:24.176
A lot of women see that
right there, "Ooh-whee."

06:24.510 --> 06:25.761
They'd sit and watch.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.680
No. I... Not to me.

06:28.764 --> 06:29.723
No.

06:30.849 --> 06:31.850
Gross.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.520
It's not really gross,
but it's not really like...

06:34.853 --> 06:36.355
attractive either.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.607
To me, it's just gross, you know.
It's just...

06:38.690 --> 06:40.025
[Vlad] How about this one?

06:40.108 --> 06:43.278
OK, yeah, that's
the bodybuilding I know.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.658
-Wow.
-That is a big dude.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.326
That's a big dude.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.579
OK, that's too big. That is too big.
Entirely too big.

06:52.663 --> 06:55.040
Oh, boy. [chuckles]

06:55.123 --> 06:58.168
I look at it as an addiction
at some point.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.212
It... it's an extreme.

07:00.295 --> 07:04.883
It restricts them in movement and stuff
and even physically in other ways

07:04.967 --> 07:07.886
and psychologically in a major way.

07:12.349 --> 07:15.352
[Vlad] <i>Competitive bodybuilding</i>
<i>has been an American institution</i>

07:15.435 --> 07:17.187
<i>since its infancy in the sixties.</i>

07:17.813 --> 07:20.357
<i>Though there have been</i>
<i>many foreign champions,</i>

07:20.440 --> 07:23.944
<i>almost all of them had relocated</i>
<i>to the US to pursue their dreams.</i>

07:24.736 --> 07:27.948
<i>But as technology advances</i>
<i>and the world becomes more connected,</i>

07:28.031 --> 07:31.076
<i>are we seeing the beginning</i>
<i>of decentralization?</i>

07:32.369 --> 07:34.830
Yeah, I think America, because
that's where it was more popular,

07:34.913 --> 07:37.249
it's where the magazines are
and that sort of thing,

07:37.332 --> 07:39.084
you get more notice there
than anywhere else.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.545
But, like I said, look at
some of the people coming out of,

07:41.628 --> 07:43.630
you know, Kuwait
and all those sort of places

07:43.714 --> 07:45.465
where you never would have heard
of them before,

07:45.549 --> 07:47.968
but now, 'cause they're getting bigger
over there, you're starting to see

07:48.051 --> 07:51.180
these names you wouldn't have
heard of back in the 1990s or 2000s.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.974
It seems like everyone has to come
to the US to be able

07:54.057 --> 07:57.144
to get that publicity and feel like
they're at that level.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.771
We're doing the Amateur Olympia
in Algeria this year.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.565
We're doing a show in Tunisia.

08:01.648 --> 08:05.485
Obviously we're in Kuwait, we're in Japan,
we're in South Korea, China.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.405
Brazil. Brazil's gonna be
one of our biggest areas.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.908
Singapore, Vietnam.
We just had a show in Vietnam there.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.701
There were 300 competitors
in Vietnam.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.120
[woman] You travel to these countries
and you do these shows

08:15.204 --> 08:18.290
and it's like you step off the bus
to go to the arena

08:18.373 --> 08:20.417
and they swarm you.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.544
They just want to touch you
and see you and feel you

08:22.628 --> 08:25.339
because you're real,
you're like this celebrity.

08:25.422 --> 08:29.635
It's like, hell, United States, you just
go to a show and you do it.

08:29.718 --> 08:32.929
Hi, Kai Greene. Welcome to Xi'an.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.432
-[Greene] Thank you, thank you.
-[man] Hello, hello, hello.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.183
Thank you, thank you.

08:39.061 --> 08:43.023
[Jay Cutler] There's a lot more excitement
there than you get in the US.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.734
I think people now are getting
more excited to compete

08:45.817 --> 08:48.487
and I think the talent pool
is just amazing.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.989
You got different cultures competing
and you know the physiques.

08:51.073 --> 08:54.117
I mean, genetic makeup
of a lot of these cultures,

08:54.201 --> 08:57.788
a lot of these guys are built
for this business and they're dedicated.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.249
So they're giving more time
to developing their bodies

09:00.332 --> 09:02.501
and becoming their best
in the hopes to be able

09:02.584 --> 09:07.297
to either leave there or represent
their country better through the business.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.593
[Vlad] <i>Another major factor that led</i>
<i>to growth of pro bodybuilding</i>

09:12.052 --> 09:15.764
<i>was the recent introduction of several</i>
<i>new divisions by the federations.</i>

09:17.182 --> 09:20.227
<i>These new divisions opened</i>
<i>the door to a wider audience</i>

09:20.310 --> 09:23.438
<i>and tailor themselves</i>
<i>to specific body types.</i>

09:24.565 --> 09:27.609
[man] Men's Physique is a body
you would see almost in <i>GQ</i>

09:27.693 --> 09:29.319
or in a fitness magazine.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.530
A physique that's not overly developed,

09:31.613 --> 09:33.532
but in very good condition
with excellent shape.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.450
It would be just enough development

09:35.534 --> 09:37.703
of a body you wouldn't even
need weights almost for.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.788
Condition and shape is what we look for.

09:39.872 --> 09:42.332
Classic Physique is,
you take a physique body

09:42.416 --> 09:44.960
and a bodybuilder's body
and you meet it halfway.

09:45.043 --> 09:49.840
It's a developed body that you need to put
in the gym, heavy squats, heavy lifting.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.843
It's a physique that you would see
in a bodybuilding magazine

09:52.926 --> 09:56.096
showing you exercises,
but not the ultimate.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.515
Men's Open is the ultimate.

09:58.599 --> 10:02.269
That is the male body taken
to the ultimate development.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.563
The biggest muscles,
the biggest conditioning,

10:04.646 --> 10:08.275
the biggest shape: the guys
that have taken it to the limit.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.614
[Vlad] <i>So what division is the best?</i>

10:13.697 --> 10:15.991
<i>Which physique is supreme?</i>

10:16.074 --> 10:19.745
<i>Is there such thing as a perfect physique?</i>
<i>Can it ever be achieved?</i>

10:19.828 --> 10:23.707
<i>Or is it simply predetermined for us</i>

<i>has the potential</i>

<i>to be a leading Men's Open competitor.</i>

10:52.486 --> 10:56.573

11:01.078 --> 11:04.331
<i>There, he'll be challenged</i>

11:05.874 --> 11:07.584
<i>If he ends up placing badly,</i>

11:07.918 --> 11:11.797
<i>this will show that the hype</i>

11:15.384 --> 11:16.969
[Regan] In order to do well
in bodybuilding,

11:17.052 --> 11:18.220
you've got to be a little bit crazy.

11:18.303 --> 11:22.391
Just with the diet and nutrition,
it's a whole other level of suffering.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.185
Bodybuilding, I didn't even know
it was like a big thing.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.062
I didn't even know about it.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.439
[Vlad] <i>Before becoming</i>
<i>a full-time bodybuilder,</i>

11:29.523 --> 11:32.025
<i>Regan lived the dream of motocross.</i>

11:32.109 --> 11:33.485
<i>But after sustaining injuries,</i>

11:33.569 --> 11:36.780
<i>his life now is all about training</i>
<i>and eating.</i>

11:40.284 --> 11:43.704
Regan's not the most organized person.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.582
He's good with the training
and he can follow the diet.

11:46.665 --> 11:49.793
He just needs someone to like
help him with the meals.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.672
Don't tell him I said that.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.757
We were both working
at a supplement store

11:55.841 --> 11:57.509
which was at Western University,

11:57.593 --> 11:59.553
and I was attending
Western University.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.722
Then we're also both working in a bar.

12:01.805 --> 12:05.142
So he was doing security
and I was doing bottle service.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.187
I always thought he was good looking
and I liked him, he was a funny guy,

12:08.270 --> 12:11.857
nice, but I never really knew that
he had a thing for me or anything,

12:11.940 --> 12:15.527
'cause we were just really friendly,
and you know, he's very, he's just chill.

12:15.611 --> 12:18.906
So, he was never really
that obvious about it.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.824
Then eventually we just
kind of started hanging out

12:20.908 --> 12:24.703
and one thing led to the next,
and then here we are, five years later.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.123
How was your day, Otis?

12:29.541 --> 12:33.420
When we met, I hadn't even done
my first competition to becoming pro,

12:33.504 --> 12:36.882
so like we kind of went through
that whole journey together.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.926
And, you know, she's been there
for everything

12:39.009 --> 12:42.304
and pushed me through
times I thought I would give up.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.517
-[Victoria] Your waist looks smaller.
-[Regan] Yeah, that's coming in tighter.

12:46.600 --> 12:50.103
[Victoria] Go back two.
I think you could hit that one better.

12:50.187 --> 12:51.188
[Regan] Yeah, yeah.

12:51.855 --> 12:55.150
And I think this one too,
the front I could have hit better, too.

12:55.234 --> 12:56.693
Sometimes I lean back

12:56.777 --> 12:59.696
and I should be leaning forward
in my upper body a little bit.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.699
Every morning, for my coach, Chris Aceto,
we take photos,

13:02.783 --> 13:03.992
and I send them off to him.

13:04.076 --> 13:07.496
Uh, also, like, right when I wake up,
I'll take my weight, too,

13:07.579 --> 13:10.457
so I'll record my weight
and then we'll come get the photos

13:10.541 --> 13:15.462
and I'll send them both off to him,
and then he'll give me like my plan for...

13:15.546 --> 13:19.216
sometimes he'll switch like today
or it will be for tomorrow.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.384
[groaning, grunting]

13:28.934 --> 13:29.977
[sighs]

13:30.060 --> 13:32.312
[groaning, breathing deeply]

13:39.361 --> 13:41.071
[panting]

13:44.241 --> 13:45.450
[exhales sharply]

13:45.534 --> 13:46.952
Let's go, come on.

14:15.189 --> 14:17.316
Come on, two. One more.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.360
-Good.
-[man] Is he okay?

14:21.486 --> 14:24.031
Logan just puked everywhere.
It was hilarious.

14:24.573 --> 14:25.449
Yeah.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.247
He's puking.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.417
OK. Here we go.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.927
You're not supposed to make
eye contact during this...

14:45.427 --> 14:46.386
[laughs]

14:52.351 --> 14:55.854
[Vlad] <i>Over the past few years,</i>
<i>bodybuilding began taking shape</i>

14:55.938 --> 14:57.773
<i>in a variety of different countries,</i>

14:57.856 --> 15:01.193
<i>a movement that has been pioneered</i>
<i>by individuals across the globe</i>

15:01.276 --> 15:04.571
<i>who have made it their mission</i>
<i>to introduce and expand bodybuilding</i>

15:04.655 --> 15:06.573
<i>to a whole new audience.</i>

15:06.657 --> 15:09.493
<i>I sat down with some key members</i>
<i>of the industry</i>

15:09.576 --> 15:11.828
<i>to get their take</i>
<i>on this everchanging landscape</i>

15:11.912 --> 15:13.539
<i>and learn more about bodybuilding.</i>

15:13.622 --> 15:17.626
You know, America, US, is known
as capital of bodybuilding.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.295
Like Venice Beach,
it's associated with bodybuilding.

15:20.379 --> 15:23.632
Now, do you think people from
different countries all over the world

15:23.715 --> 15:27.553
can potentially take that mecca
away from the US

15:27.636 --> 15:30.138
if they invest in bodybuilding
and if they grow it?

15:30.222 --> 15:33.684
I don't know, because I feel like
Arnold did this.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.937
I feel like Arnold made it
like an American thing

15:37.020 --> 15:40.357
because it's almost like, it's like
tied into like movies and Hollywood,

15:40.440 --> 15:42.317
at least where he went with it,

15:42.401 --> 15:44.361
and I think people see that
in the bodybuilding.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.905
They almost have this dream
of maybe they could be part of that

15:46.989 --> 15:48.782
or be somewhere along those lines,

15:48.866 --> 15:51.201
and I think it has to do
with L.A. and Hollywood.

15:51.285 --> 15:53.787
When I was first competing,
America was way ahead

15:53.871 --> 15:56.915
with the gyms and the restaurants
and the food and everything.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.418
So now you can get a good gym
anywhere in the world

15:59.501 --> 16:03.172
and the Internet's made
the world much smaller.

16:03.255 --> 16:05.007
Generally, in Europe
and the Middle East,

16:05.090 --> 16:08.635
they look at it as they would look
at basketball players: they're stars.

16:08.719 --> 16:12.389
Kai, Kai Greene is a huge star
in the Middle East.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.058
When I went to Iran,
I was treated like a rock star.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.768
It's the same all around the Middle East.

16:16.852 --> 16:19.479
Ah, it's amazing.
India. China.

16:19.563 --> 16:20.981
Uh, Brazil.

16:21.064 --> 16:26.195
All these emerging markets now
where fitness is huge.

16:26.278 --> 16:29.364
Everywhere. We're just trying
to expand wherever we can.

16:36.288 --> 16:39.124
[Vlad] <i>After investigating</i>
<i>these newly emerging markets,</i>

16:39.208 --> 16:42.294
<i>we traveled to India</i>
<i>to meet Sheru Aangrish,</i>

16:42.377 --> 16:45.506
<i>a now-retired bodybuilder</i>
<i>who has made it his mission</i>

16:45.589 --> 16:48.967
<i>to transform India</i>
<i>into a main hub for fitness.</i>

16:49.843 --> 16:51.428
[Vlad] ...the population, right?

16:51.512 --> 16:53.639
China has the biggest population,
obviously.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.265
[Sheru] Yeah. India is number two.

16:55.349 --> 16:58.685
Number two, but the most important
thing is, it's a young population.

16:58.769 --> 17:05.150
Yeah, I mean, exactly 63% of population
in India is less than 35 years of age.

17:05.233 --> 17:09.863
And if you compare the Indian statistics
a few years ago,

17:09.946 --> 17:15.285
the literacy rate was way down,
but the younger population is literate,

17:15.368 --> 17:19.705
so obviously when people are literate,
they have more knowledge, more sense,

17:19.790 --> 17:23.627
and, uh, the decision making is right,
that's the key factor.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.630
What about the income of,
you know, like a general income?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.214
-Is it growing in India?
-Yeah.

17:28.298 --> 17:31.176
If you see numbers, obviously
the Indian economy

17:31.260 --> 17:36.431
is the only economy in the world with
a growth rate of 6.927.1, you know?

17:36.515 --> 17:39.393
And I do feel it's the beginning
of a new era.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.395
[drums beating]

18:02.457 --> 18:05.961
[Vlad] <i>His ambition is to make</i>
<i>bodybuilding bigger than cricket,</i>

18:06.044 --> 18:08.338
<i>India's number one watched sport.</i>

18:08.422 --> 18:12.092
<i>While he tries to engage Bollywood stars</i>
<i>to take interest in fitness,</i>

18:12.176 --> 18:16.096
<i>India's only Men's Open pro competitor,</i>
<i>Varinder Ghuman,</i>

18:16.180 --> 18:20.058
<i>has made it his mission to do the same,</i>
<i>but on an individual level.</i>

18:20.142 --> 18:23.312
<i>He will soon be competing</i>
<i>in the San Marino Pro,</i>

18:23.395 --> 18:26.648
<i>a major European competition</i>
<i>with top-level athletes.</i>

18:26.732 --> 18:28.609
[Sheru]
Varinder Ghuman, you know,

18:28.692 --> 18:32.362
right now the only professional
bodybuilder from India.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.823
People call him "He-Man of India."

18:34.907 --> 18:39.077
So he's a pretty known face
and working on different ventures.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.371
Now, you're the only Indian

18:41.455 --> 18:42.831
-IBB pro right now?
-Yes.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.209
Why do you think you're the only one?

18:45.292 --> 18:46.919
Why do you think there's not a lot more?

18:47.002 --> 18:49.296
I'm unique, man. [chuckles]

18:49.379 --> 18:51.215
I hope there will be more, upcoming years,

18:51.298 --> 18:54.718
India is going to produce
many more pro bodybuilders.

18:56.512 --> 18:58.347
[Sheru]
A lot of talent coming from India

18:58.430 --> 19:00.599
when we talk about
mainstream bodybuilding.

19:00.682 --> 19:02.935
You will see Indian winning Mr. Olympia

19:03.018 --> 19:05.229
when we talk about Classic Physique
and Men's Physique.

19:07.356 --> 19:09.149
[Brandon] We're not as big
as the Open bodybuilders,

19:09.233 --> 19:13.570
but we have a nice, you know, shape,
nice V taper, shoulder-waist ratio.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.072
Me and guys like Andre Ferguson,

19:15.155 --> 19:17.241
we're one of the bigger guys
in Men's Physique.

19:17.324 --> 19:21.119
If you look at Men's Physique from 2011,
2012, around that time period,

19:21.453 --> 19:23.247
those weren't really bodybuilders.

19:23.330 --> 19:27.084
It was more like a beach look,
with a little bit of muscle.

19:27.167 --> 19:30.838
And the conditioning wasn't even there.
It was like more of a softer look.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.216
Like they didn't want you coming in
as hard as we come in now.

19:34.299 --> 19:37.970
It became baby bodybuilding; there's no
way you're gonna look at Men's Physique--

19:38.053 --> 19:39.346
Baby bodybuilders.

19:39.429 --> 19:42.349
There's no way that's not bodybuilding.
The top guys are bodybuilders.

19:44.768 --> 19:47.145
[Brandon] I think it's changing, man,
it's changing again.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.356
There might be a new champion
this year.

19:49.731 --> 19:53.193
When I was 16, I remember telling
my best friend, Keke, in the gym,

19:53.277 --> 19:55.112
after practice, I was like, "I wanna be

19:55.195 --> 19:57.364
a professional bodybuilder one day."

19:57.447 --> 20:00.200
Didn't have the biggest muscles,
but I always had a nice shape and abs.

20:00.284 --> 20:01.368
And I've always...

20:01.869 --> 20:04.079
even growing up, I would always
be the one in pictures

20:04.162 --> 20:05.622
to like lift my shirt up
and show my abs.

20:05.706 --> 20:09.793
So I've always been that kind of like,
kind of guy that's just been out there.

20:09.877 --> 20:11.545
And, um, I was kind of confused.

20:11.628 --> 20:14.798
I didn't really know what I wanted to do
or where my life was gonna go,

20:14.882 --> 20:18.427
so I ended up going to college and just
trying to figure out what I wanted to do.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.929
Got my bachelor's in science at SIU,

20:21.013 --> 20:23.182
and throughout those four years,
I really just partied.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.225
I didn't lift, I didn't do anything.
I was partying.

20:25.309 --> 20:28.812
I joined a black organization,
modeling organization, called Essence,

20:28.896 --> 20:31.023
so I was doing some modeling;
it was a blessing in disguise

20:31.106 --> 20:34.610
because, what I've learned,
how to use a stage in modeling.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.111
I apply it now to bodybuilding.

20:36.195 --> 20:37.821
Oh, these pants too tight.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.781
Ohh!

20:39.865 --> 20:42.534
Ooh, see, that's the problem
when you go shopping with a bodybuilder.

20:42.618 --> 20:45.287
The pants too tight. [chuckles]

20:47.497 --> 20:51.376
[Vlad] <i>After starting</i>
<i>his Men's Physique journey in 2012,</i>

20:51.460 --> 20:56.381
<i>Brandon quickly rose to the top</i>
<i>and won the Arnold Classic in 2016,</i>

20:56.465 --> 20:57.883
<i>a major accomplishment.</i>

20:58.425 --> 21:01.762
<i>Unable to land a repeat victory</i>
<i>the following year,</i>

21:01.845 --> 21:05.349
<i>he now must work his hardest</i>
<i>to prove he can do it again.</i>

21:08.435 --> 21:10.354
[grunting]

21:19.821 --> 21:20.781
[Brandon] So, I was backstage,

21:20.864 --> 21:23.325
getting ready to be handed
my trophy by Arnold.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.619
He was backstage
and he shook my hand and said,

21:25.702 --> 21:27.913
"Man, you look awesome,
you look super shredded."

21:27.996 --> 21:30.082
That's the <i>Kindergarten Cop</i>,
like, that's my idol.

21:30.165 --> 21:33.877
I started bodybuilding, you know,
the motivation was from Arnold, you know.

21:33.961 --> 21:36.505
He paved this way for us.
He made the opportunity.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.924
I wouldn't be sitting right here
if it wasn't for Arnold,

21:39.007 --> 21:42.094
so he's someone I really
look up to in the industry,

21:42.177 --> 21:45.848
and to actually win his own show
was a super dream come true.

21:47.558 --> 21:50.143
That was 2016.
This is 2018, my man.

21:50.227 --> 21:51.645
[chuckles]

22:04.616 --> 22:06.910
I'm the guy that came second
at the Arnold last year.

22:06.994 --> 22:08.453
I won the New York Pro that year.

22:08.537 --> 22:12.165
Got second at the Olympia.
I'm no damn underdog. [chuckles]

22:14.334 --> 22:17.337
[Vlad] <i>There is much more on the line</i>
<i>beyond his pride.</i>

22:17.421 --> 22:19.715
<i>Brandon relies on sponsors</i>
<i>for income,</i>

22:19.798 --> 22:24.720
<i>and without the awards and trophies,</i>
<i>sponsors tend to disappear.</i>

22:29.141 --> 22:34.146
<i>São Paolo is one of the most</i>
<i>densely populated cities in South America.</i>

22:34.563 --> 22:37.566
<i>It seems that here,</i>
<i>fitness is second nature.</i>

22:39.318 --> 22:42.446
<i>And yet, for Men's Open bodybuilder</i>
<i>Rafael Brandão,</i>

22:42.529 --> 22:45.532
<i>putting on muscle mass wasn't always easy.</i>

22:46.950 --> 22:50.746
[in Portuguese] I started to train when
I was 14 because I was very skinny.

22:50.829 --> 22:57.169
And I always hung around older people
and they were always bigger.

22:57.252 --> 23:00.881
They always picked on me,
called me skinny.

23:00.964 --> 23:03.467
This bothered me a lot,
so I decided to join a gym

23:03.550 --> 23:06.345
so I could build a physique,
so I wouldn't be picked on.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.309
Before I was an athlete,
I was a normal teenager

23:12.392 --> 23:15.103
who would go out on the weekends,
drink a lot.

23:15.187 --> 23:20.400
Since becoming an athlete, I don't have
this partying lifestyle anymore.

23:21.944 --> 23:25.322
[Vlad] <i>His sight is set</i>
<i>on San Marino Pro Show in Italy.</i>

23:25.405 --> 23:28.617
<i>It's an important stepping stone</i>
<i>for many bodybuilders,</i>

23:28.700 --> 23:32.788
<i>especially those who one day</i>
<i>want to fight for top awards</i>

23:32.871 --> 23:35.457
<i>and prize money in the six-figure range.</i>

23:37.334 --> 23:40.170
[in Portuguese] This will be
a unique moment.

23:40.254 --> 23:43.757
I will only have a single debut
as a professional and this is it.

23:43.841 --> 23:46.468
I want to get there in the best shape

23:46.552 --> 23:51.390
and be able to take it all in
and have fun,

23:51.473 --> 23:53.267
which will be very good for me.

23:55.018 --> 23:55.894
Hey.

23:57.104 --> 24:00.607
I believe the job of a bodybuilder
is not to prepare for three months,

24:00.691 --> 24:02.693
but to live as a bodybuilder.

24:02.776 --> 24:06.488
I at least believe that
the successful bodybuilder

24:06.572 --> 24:10.200
lives this style of life all year round,
and that's what I do.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.472
My name is Ariel Khadr.

24:32.556 --> 24:36.226
And I'm originally from New York
and I'm now living in Miami, Florida.

24:36.310 --> 24:37.728
I'm an IFBB fitness pro.

24:37.811 --> 24:41.732
I was one of the youngest
to ever become an IFBB pro at 17.

24:41.815 --> 24:44.568
Fitness, you know, it was something
I loved and I wanted to do it,

24:44.651 --> 24:49.114
but, you know, I'm 17, and I was
originally recruited for gymnastics,

24:49.198 --> 24:51.783
to Rutgers University,
but because of my ankle injuries,

24:51.867 --> 24:54.036
I wasn't able to do college gymnastics.

24:54.119 --> 24:55.370
Since I got my pro card,

24:55.454 --> 24:58.081
it was actually six years
until the day I stepped on stage,

24:58.165 --> 25:00.626
and that's where my pro career started.

25:02.002 --> 25:04.796
There's no meaning behind
the abstract paintings, they're just...

25:04.880 --> 25:07.883
I didn't want them
to come out like flowers. [chuckles]

25:09.843 --> 25:12.721
So, actually this is all, mostly,
from the Arnold last year.

25:12.804 --> 25:16.391
And this is Ms. Olympia,
Oksana Grishina.

25:16.475 --> 25:20.771
She reminds me a little bit of how I,
like, really, really get into the routine.

25:20.854 --> 25:22.940
Um, where you become the routine.

25:23.023 --> 25:26.318
You don't just perform a routine,
you're now the routine.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.987
Oksana does that, better than I do.

25:38.664 --> 25:41.917
What's Fitness about?
It's just about creativity right now.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.377
It's about highest energy,

25:43.460 --> 25:47.798
strength, and they all come up
with different ideas.

25:47.881 --> 25:50.884
Interesting ideas.
I can see they're thinking about it.

25:50.968 --> 25:53.804
They're really trying to make Fitness
more entertainment.

25:53.887 --> 25:57.140
The Fitness division is judged
based off of two rounds.

25:57.224 --> 26:00.185
We have a physique round,
which is a two-piece bikini.

26:00.269 --> 26:04.439
It's judged similarly
to how figure is judged,

26:04.857 --> 26:09.152
in terms of proportion, muscularity,
femininity, leanness.

26:09.695 --> 26:12.239
The physique round, though,
is only 30% of our score.

26:12.322 --> 26:16.201
But at the same time,
we represent stamina,

26:16.285 --> 26:18.704
highest stamina in performers.

26:18.787 --> 26:22.249
So this is the second round,
the routine round.

26:22.332 --> 26:24.751
The routine round is 70% of our score,

26:24.835 --> 26:28.714
and the routine round is based off
of creativity, performance,

26:28.797 --> 26:31.633
agility, strength skills,
and how you carry yourself,

26:31.717 --> 26:33.719
how you're able to entertain the crowd.

26:33.802 --> 26:37.055
So all these things you've got to
represent for two minutes on stage

26:37.139 --> 26:38.515
for the judges.

26:38.599 --> 26:43.312
What many people don't understand is we
compete just like every athlete on stage.

26:43.395 --> 26:47.441
We've got to sculpt our physique, but
in addition to that, we need to find time

26:47.524 --> 26:51.570
to put together a routine, work
on flexibility, work on strength skills,

26:51.653 --> 26:55.282
work on dance,
so you have this entire element

26:55.365 --> 27:00.454
that's added to prepping for a show
that several other divisions don't have.

27:00.537 --> 27:02.956
To be honest, some people just
aren't cut out for it.

27:08.003 --> 27:09.546
[phone rings]

27:09.922 --> 27:10.964
[woman] <i>Good morning.</i>

27:11.048 --> 27:14.218
-Hey, how are ya?
-<i>I'm doing great, how are you?</i>

27:14.301 --> 27:16.720
[Whitney] I loved dance, growing up.
I was a cheerleader.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.765
And so I had that as a background
and thought, well, gosh,

27:19.848 --> 27:24.019
this is an awesome way to kind of parlay
what I used to do when I was younger,

27:24.102 --> 27:25.562
but now do it as an adult.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.940
-Hello!
-[woman] How are ya?

27:28.023 --> 27:29.191
Good.
How are you?

[Vlad] <i>Whitney Jones</i>

27:32.069 --> 27:34.571

27:34.655 --> 27:37.407

27:37.491 --> 27:39.493

27:39.576 --> 27:42.496
<i>in the absence of the former champ,</i>
<i>Oksana.</i>

27:42.579 --> 27:45.832
<i>After a serious neck injury</i>
<i>that almost led to retirement,</i>

27:45.916 --> 27:49.336

27:52.464 --> 27:54.132
<i>She ruptured her ACL.</i>

27:54.758 --> 27:57.386
<i>Despite of that, she decides to compete.</i>

27:57.469 --> 27:59.596
<i>With the surgery scheduled</i>
<i>after the Arnold,</i>

27:59.680 --> 28:03.016
<i>physical therapy is the only option</i>

28:03.100 --> 28:05.227
<i>and keep the injury from worsening.</i>

28:05.310 --> 28:08.021
<i>She has just a few weeks to prepare.</i>

28:08.730 --> 28:11.608
Neck's still doing well.
It hasn't, I mean, I...

28:11.692 --> 28:15.779
It hasn't even been a year yet
for the neck fusion, and so...

28:15.863 --> 28:17.990
I saw the pictures.
I couldn't believe it.

28:18.073 --> 28:19.408
Crazy, isn't it?

28:19.783 --> 28:22.911
I've just got to come up
with a one-legged routine.

28:22.995 --> 28:25.914
I got one good leg.
I gotta keep this leg healthy.

28:25.998 --> 28:27.833
-Really?
-I got to make sure I don't

28:27.916 --> 28:31.461
screw up my neck worse 'cause now
I've got to change a lot of the skills,

28:31.545 --> 28:34.673
which, I got to utilize my upper body
as much as I can.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.466
So how's your routine going so far?

28:36.550 --> 28:38.468
Um, I'm having to start all over.

28:39.219 --> 28:43.348
I mean, normally you have your routine
done four months out.

28:43.432 --> 28:46.935
And so I technically only have
three weeks, 'cause travel time.

28:47.019 --> 28:49.271
So I have three weeks to put together...

28:50.355 --> 28:53.150
[chuckles] So, it's a little crazy.

28:53.233 --> 28:56.028
But I feel like I thrive under pressure

28:56.111 --> 28:58.655
and it's gonna force me to think
out of the box.

28:58.739 --> 29:00.282
[man] Wow. I like your attitude.

29:22.054 --> 29:24.306
[Vlad] <i>Located in the heart</i>

29:52.626 --> 29:55.587
<i>One such person is Mikhail Volinkin,</i>

29:55.671 --> 29:57.506

<i>Due to this, survival became</i>

30:10.853 --> 30:17.442
[in Russian] Misha
is a very interesting kid.

30:18.318 --> 30:22.739
What caught my eye
is his strong character.

30:22.823 --> 30:26.785
They told me he was from an orphanage,

30:26.869 --> 30:29.955
very goal-oriented.

30:32.040 --> 30:38.005
[man in Russian] You know,
there are teenagers

30:38.922 --> 30:44.761
who, like Misha, don't have parents
and grow up in an orphanage.

30:44.845 --> 30:49.600
And from an early age
they have no motivation.

30:49.683 --> 30:53.103
But Misha is different.
He always loved working.

30:54.229 --> 30:57.649
He has discipline.

30:57.733 --> 30:59.401

[indistinct conversation]

31:47.533 --> 31:48.659
[sighs]

31:48.742 --> 31:51.203
[in Russian] It was cool.
I was the only one training.

31:51.286 --> 31:53.956
And then boxed, we were sparring.

32:05.634 --> 32:08.846
I could do several rounds of 20 reps

32:08.929 --> 32:10.973
and then my hands hurt a lot.

32:11.515 --> 32:14.017
When my palms were abraded,
I pulled up on my fingers.

32:15.227 --> 32:18.146
Here we also did flips.

32:18.230 --> 32:19.606
We came over here...

32:21.483 --> 32:22.693
stepped up a bit here...

32:24.945 --> 32:26.488
and did the flips.

32:26.572 --> 32:29.867
[Vlad] <i>After winning all local</i>

32:35.539 --> 32:37.875
<i>It's an honor just to be selected,</i>

32:37.958 --> 32:41.962
<i>as now he finally has a chance</i>

32:42.045 --> 32:46.842

32:46.925 --> 32:49.970
<i>and win the overall</i>

32:50.512 --> 32:53.557
<i>He remains calm and collected,</i>

32:53.640 --> 32:56.685

33:30.802 --> 33:34.223
<i>The African continent often gets</i>

33:34.306 --> 33:37.309
<i>in comparison to Europe</i>
<i>and the Americas,</i>

33:37.392 --> 33:41.104
<i>perhaps due to the perception</i>

33:41.188 --> 33:44.733
<i>In Ghana, the average monthly income</i>
<i>is equivalent</i>

33:44.816 --> 33:47.486
<i>to 170 American dollars.</i>

<i>Most gyms are a luxury,</i>
<i>only available to a few.</i>

33:51.490 --> 33:52.866

33:57.079 --> 34:00.707
<i>He wakes up early every morning</i>
<i>and trains his clients,</i>

34:00.791 --> 34:03.210
<i>other aspiring fitness crusaders.</i>

34:03.293 --> 34:06.880
This is a sport that comes to you
with almost nothing.

34:06.964 --> 34:09.132
You don't even have the gym
to begin with.

34:09.216 --> 34:10.926
And when I'm talking about
you don't have a gym,

34:11.009 --> 34:14.304
I'm talking you have to make your own gym
out of whatever you could find.

34:14.388 --> 34:18.725
Pieces of stones, wood, and any metallic
object that you can find around.

34:18.809 --> 34:22.020
And you bring these things together
just to form your gym.

34:22.103 --> 34:26.984
In Ghana, I would say it's very difficult.

34:27.067 --> 34:31.612
Difficult in the aspect of where to train,

34:31.697 --> 34:33.657
especially the food aspect.

34:33.739 --> 34:37.828
[Collins] The hardest part about being
a bodybuilder to me is nutrition.

34:37.911 --> 34:39.663
[Samuel] I've heard
most bodybuilders

34:39.746 --> 34:43.166
eat like 6 to 12 times the limit.

34:43.250 --> 34:48.463
Here, looking at how things are,
you cannot afford to eat that.

34:48.547 --> 34:51.925
You go bankrupt, yeah. [chuckles]
You can't.

34:52.009 --> 34:54.011
I use it as a motivation.

34:54.094 --> 34:57.806
So I want to use it
to motivate others to know that

34:57.890 --> 34:59.266
you don't have to look at where you are.

34:59.349 --> 35:01.393
You don't have to look
at the situation you are in.

35:01.476 --> 35:04.354
You can make big things out
from something small.

35:04.438 --> 35:08.942
We have such potential, we have
such good genetics here in Ghana,

35:09.026 --> 35:13.363
so I believe that we can do
great with bodybuilding.

35:13.447 --> 35:14.907
[Samuel] We don't even have

35:14.990 --> 35:18.785
a single IFBB-certified professional
bodybuilder in this country.

35:18.869 --> 35:21.580
That tells me that
we have a long way to go.

35:21.663 --> 35:24.166
We really, really have a lot to prove.

35:24.249 --> 35:26.835
[Victor] I want, at least,
to have an opportunity

35:26.919 --> 35:29.671
to compete against
the best in the world,

35:29.755 --> 35:32.299
here on home soil,

35:32.382 --> 35:37.012
and hopefully winning world laurels.

35:38.055 --> 35:40.390
[Vlad] <i>As the infrastructure</i>
<i>of the bodybuilding federation</i>

35:40.474 --> 35:42.059
<i>is not very productive here,</i>

35:42.142 --> 35:45.270
<i>Collins decides to take matters</i>
<i>into his own hands</i>

35:45.354 --> 35:47.981
<i>and puts together</i>
<i>a local bodybuilding competition</i>

35:48.065 --> 35:50.234
<i>for him and his fellow bodybuilders.</i>

35:50.317 --> 35:53.695
We are the difference.
We are what they haven't seen before.

35:53.779 --> 35:55.697
And we are what they need to see.

35:58.951 --> 36:01.286
[Jay] I think bodybuilding
overseas is bigger.

36:01.370 --> 36:05.832
I think everyone's looking
for the opportunity to become recognized.

36:05.916 --> 36:08.710
Iran breeds some amazing bodybuilders,
but it's nothing new.

36:08.794 --> 36:11.171
You know, I think because
of the advent of social media,

36:11.255 --> 36:14.216
people are seeing it more,
but bodybuilding has been big in Iran

36:14.299 --> 36:15.926
for decades, for centuries.

36:21.723 --> 36:24.935
[Vlad] <i>Many consider Iran</i>
<i>as the mecca of bodybuilding</i>

36:25.018 --> 36:26.103
<i>in the Middle East.</i>

<i>Even though the country has been</i>
<i>largely isolated by the West,</i>

<i>spreading throughout the world.</i>

36:38.657 --> 36:39.700

36:39.783 --> 36:42.452
Do they have clubs? No.
Can they drink? No.

36:42.536 --> 36:45.289
So where is the one place
they can all go to?

36:45.372 --> 36:46.540
The gym.

36:46.623 --> 36:49.501
[Vlad] <i>Here it's more than a sport.</i>
<i>It's honor.</i>

36:50.335 --> 36:53.463
<i>However, participating in the most</i>
<i>prestigious shows in the US</i>

36:53.547 --> 36:57.759
<i>is nearly impossible,</i>
<i>due to the recently imposed travel ban.</i>

36:58.218 --> 37:00.679
<i>This hurts many</i>
<i>of the local competitors.</i>

37:01.680 --> 37:05.601
<i>Hadi Choopan, a fierce 212 bodybuilder</i>
<i>from the south of Iran,</i>

37:05.684 --> 37:07.311
<i>is one such competitor.</i>

37:09.104 --> 37:11.565
<i>The Men's 212 division</i>
<i>limits all competitors</i>

37:11.648 --> 37:14.443
<i>to weigh no more than 212 pounds.</i>

37:14.526 --> 37:18.197
<i>This division allows for the same level</i>
<i>of large muscles and bulk</i>

37:18.280 --> 37:22.242
<i>as the Men's Open</i>
<i>but drastically limits the weight.</i>

37:23.785 --> 37:26.163
-[horn honks]
-[chuckles]

37:30.083 --> 37:33.253
There's a lot of amazing bodybuilders
that I think would do really, really good

37:33.337 --> 37:35.672
competing here in the States,
but they can't because of visas.

37:35.756 --> 37:37.716
It's horrible, it's horrible.

37:37.799 --> 37:41.428
I... I feel really, really bad
for those guys because...

37:41.512 --> 37:44.223
it's not in their hands.
They have nothing to do with this.

37:44.306 --> 37:46.308
This is just pure politics
and all that nonsense.

37:46.391 --> 37:51.897
[in Farsi] I am a professional athlete,
member of IFBB Pro,

37:51.980 --> 37:57.194
like a newborn baby
in the professional family.

37:58.153 --> 38:03.242
That being said, I, as the new member,
expect that the head of this family

38:03.325 --> 38:08.664
will support me
 and solve the visa problem.

38:08.747 --> 38:14.586
so I can freely compete
in the required competitions.

38:14.670 --> 38:17.422
We've been trying to get Hadi
into the Olympia, but I mean,

38:17.506 --> 38:20.217
with, you know, the... the government.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.511
I mean,
that's really out of our hands.

38:22.594 --> 38:24.930
I mean, we've written letters,
we've tried.

38:25.013 --> 38:27.808
But that's just really above our calling.

38:27.891 --> 38:29.977
[Jim] I'm the president
of the NPC and IFBB,

38:30.060 --> 38:33.146
but I'm not Donald Trump,
so I can't change that, you know.

38:33.230 --> 38:36.692
But these guys are going to a lot
of our international pro qualifiers

38:36.775 --> 38:38.151
and are winning a lot of them.

38:38.235 --> 38:41.530
[Vlad] <i>Unable to get</i>
<i>an entry visa to the US,</i>

38:41.613 --> 38:46.702
<i>Hadi makes a decision to compete</i>
<i>in San Marino Pro on the coast of Italy.</i>

38:46.785 --> 38:49.788
<i>However, he will have to move up</i>
<i>to Men's Open division,</i>

38:49.872 --> 38:53.458
<i>as many European competitions</i>
<i>don't offer 212.</i>

38:54.126 --> 38:57.921
It's a shame, I mean, they can compete
in the pro shows in Europe or something,

38:58.005 --> 38:59.882
but I don't know
if we'll ever see them here.

38:59.965 --> 39:02.551
Hopefully, the world will change someday
that we can.

39:19.026 --> 39:21.403
OK, good news, good news, OK.

39:21.486 --> 39:23.947
Tell everybody, grab somebody's hand.

39:24.031 --> 39:26.825
Everybody grab somebody's hand
and make a chain.

39:26.909 --> 39:28.911
[interpreter speaking Chinese]

39:31.079 --> 39:33.040
[Kai] Great things will happen in
this circle.

39:33.123 --> 39:34.917
This circle here today.

39:35.417 --> 39:37.377
Touch your neighbor and say,
"Great things will happen

39:37.461 --> 39:39.254
here in this circle today."

39:39.338 --> 39:41.173
[interpreter speaking Chinese]

39:42.549 --> 39:44.927
Great things will happen
today in this circle.

39:45.010 --> 39:46.929
Great things will happen in this circle.

39:47.012 --> 39:49.139
Great things is gonna happen
in this circle.

39:49.598 --> 39:52.935
Ready? It's getting warm.
I can feel the warm.

39:55.062 --> 39:57.105
-I feel like a panther.
-[interpreter speaking Chinese]

39:57.189 --> 39:58.857
I feel like a panther,
I feel like a panther.

39:58.941 --> 40:02.569
All right? Let's get it started.
Let's do a set of ten. Let's go.

40:02.653 --> 40:05.322
-[interpreter speaking Chinese]
-And one...

40:06.782 --> 40:07.866
Two...

40:08.742 --> 40:10.786
Three... Four...

40:10.869 --> 40:11.954
[interpreter] Four.

40:12.037 --> 40:13.914
-[Kai] Five.
-[interpreter] Five.

40:13.997 --> 40:16.792
[Kai] Six. Seven.

40:16.875 --> 40:17.918
[all] Eight.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.211
Nine.

40:19.837 --> 40:21.213
Ten.

40:22.631 --> 40:25.300
All right, so, I want to ask you
about genetics.

40:25.384 --> 40:29.179
Do you think people in certain countries
have genetic limitations

40:29.263 --> 40:31.557
that will prevent them succeeding
in bodybuilding?

40:31.640 --> 40:34.893
Do you believe that
that can be the sad truth of it all?

40:34.977 --> 40:37.104
Yeah, you know, I can recall
being in India

40:37.187 --> 40:40.691
and it was probably...

40:41.483 --> 40:45.904
I don't know, 700, 800 people,
you know, in the same room.

40:45.988 --> 40:48.907
On this platform, somebody posed
the same question.

40:48.991 --> 40:51.285
"Do you think genetics will hold us back?

40:51.368 --> 40:55.706
Do you think that our genetics here,
you know, collectively,

40:55.789 --> 41:00.460
will hold us back from our ability
to achieve larger rewards

41:00.544 --> 41:02.004
in the bodybuilding competition?"

41:02.087 --> 41:04.381
I remember thinking, damn.

41:04.464 --> 41:07.926
But I realized at the time that
the person wasn't trying to be funny.

41:08.010 --> 41:11.096
And, as I looked around the room,
there were a lot of people that were there

41:11.180 --> 41:16.226
with open eyes, you know,
really, really, you know,

41:16.310 --> 41:18.312
expecting you to answer that.

41:18.395 --> 41:20.606
I do believe genetics plays a part.

41:20.689 --> 41:24.401
You know, like Asian bodybuilders,
they're not all meant to be

41:24.484 --> 41:28.197
so big, so when you find a big
Asian bodybuilder, it's very rare.

41:28.280 --> 41:31.116
You do see them;
a lot of them have small bones,

41:31.200 --> 41:34.369
so they have nice structures
for like Classic Physique.

41:34.453 --> 41:37.623
You should have really fixed joints.

41:37.706 --> 41:41.835
You're gonna need so much more size
to make those joints look smaller.

41:41.919 --> 41:44.379
So if you have very small joints
and round muscle bellies,

41:44.463 --> 41:46.965
you might not need
that much weight on the scale

41:47.049 --> 41:49.259
to look a certain way.

41:49.343 --> 41:52.846
So, it's just, everybody has to work
with the genetics

41:52.930 --> 41:56.433
and it's going to give
like very different physiques.

41:56.517 --> 41:59.144
I think every nationality has some people
with great genetics,

41:59.228 --> 42:02.231
some people not so great, but I think
Persians, Middle Easterners as a whole,

42:02.314 --> 42:04.733
they come from a wrestling
and strength-training background.

42:04.816 --> 42:06.610
They're really good mesomorphs.

42:08.111 --> 42:11.698
Really capable of putting on size,
good strength.

42:11.782 --> 42:14.076
Some of the strongest Olympic athletes
are from Iran,

42:14.159 --> 42:16.787
broken many, many records,
so yeah, I think genetically,

42:16.870 --> 42:20.332
Persians are primed for strength training
and bodybuilding, yes.

42:22.251 --> 42:25.963
[in Portuguese] Since Brazilians are a mix
of different races,

42:26.046 --> 42:27.923
the genetic pool is really big.

42:28.799 --> 42:32.386
So sometimes you see some people
walking around who aren't athletes,

42:32.469 --> 42:38.267
but have a beautiful physique
just from dieting and working out.

42:38.725 --> 42:41.061
[Samuel] When it comes to Africa,
we have the genetics.

42:41.144 --> 42:44.565
You can even see someone
who hasn't lifted weights before.

42:44.648 --> 42:49.319
But you see that that person
is shredded with the physique.

42:49.403 --> 42:51.572
You see the frame, everything is there.

42:51.655 --> 42:54.741
And even when you look
outside the Western world,

42:54.825 --> 42:57.870
most of the good bodybuilders are black.

42:57.953 --> 43:00.414
Then again, you want to look
at these genetics

43:00.497 --> 43:04.001
at different parts of a bodybuilder,
because there are certain parts

43:04.084 --> 43:06.712
that Africans are not
genetically gifted at.

43:06.795 --> 43:09.298
When it comes to these parts,
you want to look at the legs.

43:09.381 --> 43:11.592
You want to look at your calves.

43:11.675 --> 43:16.138
Black people, or Africans,
naturally do not have big calves.

43:16.221 --> 43:19.057
I remember being a teenager
and people telling me in my gym,

43:19.141 --> 43:21.476
you know, "Don't worry about calves
and things like that

43:21.560 --> 43:23.896
because you're black
and black men don't have calves.

43:23.979 --> 43:26.023
They can't develop calves,
so don't worry about it."

43:26.106 --> 43:27.774
-They told you this?
-[Kai] Yeah!

43:27.858 --> 43:31.028
The only limitations there
would have been the ones in my own mind.

43:31.111 --> 43:33.238
[Whitney] If you want to be in the sport,
work hard

43:33.322 --> 43:34.573
and beat 'em.

43:35.073 --> 43:36.658
Beat their natural genetics.

43:36.742 --> 43:39.703
Put in the hard work
so that it pays off,

43:39.786 --> 43:42.831
and you can
put hard work over genetics.

43:42.915 --> 43:45.209
They still have to work hard,
but maybe they're not.

43:45.292 --> 43:47.419
[Jay] I battled Ronnie Coleman,
who I thought

43:47.503 --> 43:50.172
was genetically superior to me for sure,

43:50.631 --> 43:54.259
but I overcame genetics -- Branch Warren
is a prime example of that also.

43:54.343 --> 43:56.929
We still beat people
that were better genetically.

43:57.012 --> 43:59.515
If you have 'em,
you've just got a head start.

43:59.598 --> 44:02.059
You got a much better chance
at reaching your goals

44:02.142 --> 44:05.103
if you start out with good genetics.
It's just that simple.

44:06.188 --> 44:09.024
-Genetics.
-I was blessed with genetics.

44:09.107 --> 44:11.401
But, you know, I had to apply the work.

44:11.485 --> 44:13.529
Everything I have now,
I had to work for it.

44:13.612 --> 44:15.447
[scraping windows]

44:19.826 --> 44:21.912
I'm so glad,
I just came out of Chicago.

44:21.995 --> 44:25.332
I'm one of the maybe three guys
that came out of Chicago.

44:25.749 --> 44:29.711
So it was nice to be recognized
out of here.

44:29.795 --> 44:31.255
I wasn't given anything.

44:31.338 --> 44:34.633
Everything I have now I had to work for,
work real hard for it.

44:34.716 --> 44:38.095
And I started from the bottom, just like,
I'm not even supposed to be here.

44:38.178 --> 44:39.972
Like, I wasn't supposed
to graduate college.

44:40.055 --> 44:42.641
I'm not supposed to be
a successful bodybuilder.

44:42.724 --> 44:44.268
I should be dead right now, from Chicago.

44:45.060 --> 44:47.563
If only these guys knew about the gym,
would just get in the gym,

44:47.646 --> 44:50.315
they wouldn't even have to worry
about looking cool on the street,

44:50.399 --> 44:51.942
like you can look cool in a gym.

44:52.025 --> 44:54.820
When you look at it as, I came
from nothing, you came from nothing.

44:54.903 --> 44:56.071
We're the same people.

44:56.154 --> 44:58.740
No matter where you're from,
we're still the same person.

44:58.824 --> 45:02.244
We can still accomplish the same dreams,
have the same goals.

45:03.829 --> 45:06.540
Right now, it's Men's Physique.

45:06.623 --> 45:08.375
Winning the Arnold,
winning the Olympia.

45:08.458 --> 45:09.751
That's my goal right now.

45:09.835 --> 45:12.588
We might be smaller bodybuilders
but we're still bodybuilders

45:12.671 --> 45:15.716
and we still train legs, just getting
my legs ready for next year.

45:15.799 --> 45:19.386
Once they're developed and they match
my upper body, then yeah,

45:19.469 --> 45:22.681
I'll be competitive in Classic,
Classic Physique, but...

45:22.764 --> 45:26.185
Well, now I wanna fill up my board shorts
'cause they just look good. [chuckles]

45:26.268 --> 45:29.813
Board shorts?
Good Lord, have mercy. OK, guy.

45:29.897 --> 45:33.233
You know, these categories like Men's...
I don't know what it is,

45:33.317 --> 45:35.736
where they wear these long shorts
and don't need to train legs.

45:35.819 --> 45:39.323
I've tried so hard to get into
the Men's Physique, I just can't do it.

45:39.406 --> 45:42.075
Let's be straight about it.
These are quite easy to compete in.

45:42.159 --> 45:44.077
If you're a young person,
you're quite lean,

45:44.161 --> 45:46.788
you could train for 12 months maybe,
and do a bikini

45:46.872 --> 45:49.333
or a men's fitness
or whatever it's called.

45:49.416 --> 45:52.628
[King] The essence
of bodybuilding is legs.

45:53.212 --> 45:56.673
OK? It's what separates
the men from the boys,

45:56.757 --> 45:59.676
the champs from the chumps, OK?
It's legs.

45:59.760 --> 46:02.304
[Brandon] Men's Physique guys
got this misconception where...

46:02.387 --> 46:05.724
we don't train legs, but, um...
it's... we do.

46:05.807 --> 46:10.062
If you wanna train your legs, you can.
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

46:10.145 --> 46:13.148
If you want to train them hard like
a bodybuilder, you can do that, too.

46:13.232 --> 46:15.526
But they're not being scored
so they don't matter.

46:15.609 --> 46:18.320
Men's Physique gets a lot of shit,
but it's not the same sport.

46:18.403 --> 46:20.531
It's completely different, you know.
To each their own.

46:20.614 --> 46:22.366
You know those guys
are working really hard.

46:22.449 --> 46:25.118
Just being like
a low body fat percentage, it hurts,

46:25.202 --> 46:27.788
like it's not easy to maintain.

46:27.871 --> 46:33.460
[in Portuguese] The Men's Open guys
probably look at Men's Physique

46:33.544 --> 46:37.965
and think because we wear shorts we don't
go through the same struggles as they do.

46:38.048 --> 46:40.843
[King] Those guys worked very hard
and it's very difficult to obtain.

46:40.926 --> 46:44.137
But it's a little bit more obtainable,
and more relatable, too.

46:44.221 --> 46:46.765
I mean, I wasn't too big
for Men's Physique, honestly,

46:46.849 --> 46:49.518
but I liked the idea of being able

46:49.601 --> 46:51.895
to showcase my whole physique,
being able to pose.

46:51.979 --> 46:53.647
[King] There's no bodybuilding posing.

46:53.730 --> 46:56.775
It's supposed to be more of a natural,
"This is what I look like on the beach."

46:56.859 --> 47:01.196
[Rich] When you're looking at physique,
it's just stances, front, side, back.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.031
You're just looking at a body.

47:03.115 --> 47:06.869
[Andre] What our job is to do, it's not
posing, it's looking good standing there.

47:06.952 --> 47:09.246
You have to build your aesthetics
to a point where

47:09.329 --> 47:11.373
you don't have to pose to look good.

47:11.456 --> 47:15.169
A lot of people don't think that you have
to practice posing as a Men's Physique,

47:15.252 --> 47:18.338
but you do; presentation, believe it
or not, still comes into big play.

47:18.422 --> 47:20.924
We're looking for the muscularity,
the taper, symmetry.

47:21.008 --> 47:24.094
And also it could be why
the Open bodybuilders

47:24.178 --> 47:26.054
hate Men's Physique so much because

47:26.138 --> 47:28.390
Men's Physique guys are so much more
appealable to girls,

47:28.473 --> 47:30.934
whereas girls don't like people
that are bodybuilders,

47:31.018 --> 47:32.853
so maybe there's a little bit
of jealousy there.

47:32.936 --> 47:35.689
The boys who are gods are, you know,
the pretty boys.

47:35.772 --> 47:38.734
Modeling, and the modeling contracts,
sneaky motherfuckers.

47:38.817 --> 47:41.904
[chuckles] They probably won't
get that much respect.

47:41.987 --> 47:44.114
Well, if I offended
any of you motherfuckers,

47:44.198 --> 47:46.700
fuck y'all. [chuckles]

47:46.783 --> 47:48.660
[in Portuguese] I can do a magazine cover,

47:48.744 --> 47:50.913
an underwear campaign,

47:50.996 --> 47:57.044
I can also look big and shredded.

47:57.127 --> 47:59.713
Those guys are just big and freaky
and some people are intimidated

47:59.796 --> 48:01.632
by that kind of muscle and size,

48:01.715 --> 48:05.010
but I mean, if you're in the sport,
you understand, like,

48:05.093 --> 48:06.762
that's the top of the food chain.

48:09.389 --> 48:11.683
[Rafael, in Portuguese]
When I thought about being an athlete,

48:11.767 --> 48:13.310
I wanted to compete in Men's Physique,

48:13.393 --> 48:17.272
but when I met my first trainer he wanted
to see my physique as a whole.

48:17.356 --> 48:21.652
So my trainer told me
I could not keep my legs hidden

48:21.735 --> 48:24.446
since they were such a strong point
in my physique,

48:24.530 --> 48:25.989
so I should go bodybuilding.

48:26.073 --> 48:27.407
I'm Dr. André Santos.

48:27.491 --> 48:30.035
I'm a physiotherapist who specializes
in chiropractic.

48:30.118 --> 48:33.372
For his debut in San Marino

48:33.455 --> 48:39.378
we have been working
on the volume of his back.

48:44.716 --> 48:45.968
[groaning]

48:47.719 --> 48:49.304
[groans]

48:49.388 --> 48:52.391
[Rafael in Portuguese] <i>His work</i>
<i>is fundamental for my preparation</i>

48:52.474 --> 48:54.893
<i>since we take our body</i>
<i>to the extreme every day.</i>

48:59.189 --> 49:04.611
<i>People always say that bodybuilding</i>
<i>is a lonely sport,</i>

49:04.695 --> 49:07.906
<i>but I disagree.</i>

49:07.990 --> 49:12.786
<i>Alone we can't do anything</i>
<i>or achieve anything.</i>

49:12.870 --> 49:14.830
[percussion band playing]

50:09.885 --> 50:11.470
[percussion riff plays on computer]

50:13.889 --> 50:15.849
It's weird because the beginning
of me speaking

50:15.933 --> 50:18.143
is so loud and like unclear
and the end is so low.

50:18.227 --> 50:19.353
We could fix the volume...

50:19.436 --> 50:22.523
I always wanted to do an Egyptian-themed
routine, it's always been in my head,

50:22.606 --> 50:24.858
because I'm like, I'm Egyptian,
I have to do that one day.

50:24.942 --> 50:29.029
I'm so proud of being Egyptian,
and my mom's family is Jewish,

50:29.112 --> 50:33.200
and my dad is Muslim, so that gives
really an awesome dynamic

50:33.283 --> 50:35.202
in terms of my family goes.

50:35.661 --> 50:40.040
The most important question:
can you sacrifice everything

50:40.624 --> 50:43.710
to get on this level, to be better you?

50:43.794 --> 50:46.129
Next time when you compete.

50:46.213 --> 50:49.842
Unfortunately,
not everyone can sacrifice.

50:49.925 --> 50:51.885
Sacrifice time with your family,

50:51.969 --> 50:54.263
sacrifice time with your second half.

50:54.346 --> 50:56.223
Sacrifice time with your kids.

50:56.306 --> 51:00.185
So it's hard, you know,
for most people.

51:00.269 --> 51:03.397
[Ariel] Like I was living, breathing,
sleeping bodybuilding since I'm little

51:03.480 --> 51:05.107
without knowing that I was doing that.

51:05.190 --> 51:09.111
And I'd love to be that person that could
win Ms. Olympia a couple of times.

51:09.653 --> 51:11.071
I mean, I do have a life.

51:11.154 --> 51:14.575
I can't see myself winning Ms. Olympia,
then trying to do it another ten times.

51:14.658 --> 51:16.326
My body's just not gonna handle it.

51:16.410 --> 51:19.496
Not just that, but I wanna live
a normal life one day.

51:19.580 --> 51:23.667
I mean, I've been doing athletics
and being a pro athlete my whole life.

51:23.750 --> 51:28.255
I'm 25, and even though I'm young,
almost 25 years of that,

51:28.338 --> 51:31.425
you still yearn for like,
I wanna be a mom one day.

51:31.508 --> 51:32.801
I got you!

51:32.885 --> 51:34.011
[indistinct shouting]

51:34.094 --> 51:38.015
[Whitney] My kids will always be...
always my number one priority.

51:38.098 --> 51:41.351
If anything was ever not OK with them,

51:41.435 --> 51:43.896
if they ever did not support what I did,

51:44.396 --> 51:48.358
if, um, they needed me
and I was not available

51:48.442 --> 51:52.070
because I was focused on competing,
competing would be put aside.

51:52.154 --> 51:54.615
Obviously. They are
my number one priority.

51:54.698 --> 51:56.825
But I'm fortunate,
I have two healthy kids.

51:56.909 --> 52:00.120
I have happy kids; I'm able
to balance being a single mom

52:00.204 --> 52:02.623
because I've had years
to try to figure it out.

52:03.081 --> 52:04.708
I've been able to make it work.

52:04.791 --> 52:07.211
They get to do all the activities
that they want to do.

52:07.294 --> 52:09.338
They're playing... major into sports.

52:09.421 --> 52:12.049
Every single day,
we have something going on.

52:12.132 --> 52:16.845
But again, it requires me getting up
super early

52:16.929 --> 52:18.680
in order to get my cardio in.

52:18.764 --> 52:23.477
I have to have my schedule dialed in
to the minute.

52:23.560 --> 52:25.354
Because there's no other way
I could do it.

53:00.973 --> 53:02.182
[horn honking]

53:23.370 --> 53:26.164
[Collins] Generally speaking,
an African bodybuilder

53:26.248 --> 53:29.168
is much stronger and more endurance
simply because

53:29.251 --> 53:32.963
of the hardship that a lot of us
are coming from.

53:33.046 --> 53:35.924
You have a kid who has worked
about half of his life.

53:36.008 --> 53:38.719
It's just going to be easier
for him to do

53:38.802 --> 53:42.055
than somebody who, for his whole life,
has not even carried,

53:42.139 --> 53:46.894
let's say a 30-kilo material on his head.

54:10.083 --> 54:12.085
[Vlad] <i>Collins's show is a success.</i>

54:12.461 --> 54:16.840
<i>Not because of any prizes given</i>
<i>but because it provides a platform</i>

54:16.924 --> 54:18.884
<i>to inspire other local athletes</i>

54:18.967 --> 54:22.971
<i>as they aim to create their own brand</i>
<i>of natural bodybuilding.</i>

54:28.727 --> 54:31.563
[Collins] Being a natural bodybuilder
and getting all this attention,

54:31.647 --> 54:33.524
this is what people like me for.

54:33.607 --> 54:36.693
They look at my physique,
as natural as it is, and they like it.

54:36.777 --> 54:40.030
That is good inspiration,
that is something they can look up to.

54:40.113 --> 54:41.823
That's something they can aspire to.

54:41.907 --> 54:46.078
Most of the times, when people
see you being a bodybuilder,

54:46.161 --> 54:51.792
they have the notion that you might be
taking steroids or something.

54:51.875 --> 54:55.420
But I think you can do bodybuilding
with just food.

54:55.504 --> 54:56.547
-Yeah.
-[rooster crows]

54:56.630 --> 54:59.508
You can do it with food,
and supplement if you can afford.

54:59.591 --> 55:01.426
When you're a pro bodybuilder,

55:01.510 --> 55:03.679
every single one is on steroids.

55:04.304 --> 55:05.639
Let's make that clear.

55:05.722 --> 55:08.517
Right? You know that, right?

55:08.600 --> 55:10.519
The best of the best, no names mentioned.

55:10.602 --> 55:14.606
I've worked with men who will say,
"If you told me that

55:14.690 --> 55:18.485
taking anabolic steroids is going
to take 20 years off my life,

55:18.569 --> 55:21.738
I would still do it, because at least
I would be big and muscular

55:21.822 --> 55:23.782
in the time I was here."

55:23.866 --> 55:26.326
It's incredible science,
so there's hundreds of steroids

55:26.410 --> 55:29.371
that have been produced in the world
since the 1940s and '30s.

55:29.454 --> 55:31.790
They're either for human-grade use
or animal use.

55:31.874 --> 55:34.209
Equipoise is for horses, dogs and cats.

55:34.293 --> 55:37.504
But these men use all these mixed.
They're all mixed.

55:37.588 --> 55:39.756
There's something pathological about that.

55:39.840 --> 55:43.051
That's not a healthy way of thinking
because at the end,

55:43.135 --> 55:46.471
it's not about being muscular,
it's about being happy,

55:46.555 --> 55:48.265
being confident, being accepted.

55:48.348 --> 55:51.393
The regular dose for a testosterone
replacement patient

55:51.476 --> 55:54.897
is about 100 milligrams of ester per week.

55:54.980 --> 55:59.026
Bodybuilders and strength athletes
and strongmen

55:59.109 --> 56:02.571
can use upwards of 5 grams a week.

56:03.363 --> 56:05.741
One hundred to 5,000.

56:05.824 --> 56:08.535
It's risk versus benefit ratio.

56:08.619 --> 56:12.831
And I always tell people that,
if they want to go down that road,

56:12.915 --> 56:16.835
that's up to them, but when you're 25,
you don't give a shit.

56:16.919 --> 56:19.630
You know, when you're 25, you just
want to be the best in the world

56:19.713 --> 56:20.839
and be Mr. Olympia.

56:20.923 --> 56:23.759
So when you get older,
I think you start thinking about it more.

56:23.842 --> 56:27.888
[Rich] When you see bodybuilders die
at a young age, like Dallas McCarver,

56:27.971 --> 56:30.057
I think it's really, really sad.

56:30.140 --> 56:31.725
There was a guy who had

56:31.808 --> 56:35.020
great potential in being
a great bodybuilder.

56:35.103 --> 56:38.190
And, you know, his life coming down short,

56:38.273 --> 56:41.944
for whatever reasons, from, you know,
whatever he did in bodybuilding.

56:42.027 --> 56:43.820
I always worried about my health,
you know.

56:43.904 --> 56:46.990
You know, I think my injury
that caused me to retire early

56:47.074 --> 56:49.451
was probably a blessing
in disguise because

56:49.535 --> 56:52.204
I would have probably
pushed my body to the limits

56:52.287 --> 56:55.123
to try to keep up with the bodybuilders

56:55.207 --> 56:57.626
that were like getting bigger
and bigger and bigger.

56:57.709 --> 57:00.629
Even back then, there wasn't
much emphasis on steroids.

57:00.712 --> 57:03.674
When I got into it, I was more
about the training hard, the eating.

57:04.174 --> 57:06.260
That sort of thing.
Steroids is like I heard about it

57:06.343 --> 57:08.303
and knew it was in the sport,
but it wasn't like now.

57:08.387 --> 57:12.057
You go on any website today, forums,
all people talk about is drugs, steroids.

57:12.140 --> 57:13.308
It just drives me mad.

57:13.392 --> 57:18.105
Social media has a lot of benefits
and a lot of pitfalls,

57:18.188 --> 57:20.107
and one of the pitfalls are

57:20.190 --> 57:23.569
it disseminates
a lot of unhealthy information

57:23.652 --> 57:28.240
where young people have access to it
and now can see

57:28.323 --> 57:30.534
some bodybuilder or someone saying,

57:30.617 --> 57:33.537
"Oh, well, if you do this, this and this,
then you could look this big."

57:33.620 --> 57:35.664
Let me put it to you this way, OK, look.

57:35.747 --> 57:40.419
I have a lot of friends
in whole different genres of sports.

57:40.502 --> 57:43.839
Football, baseball, basketball,
and many of them are professional.

57:43.922 --> 57:47.092
Golfers use steroids, OK?

57:47.176 --> 57:48.677
It's just a thing.

57:48.760 --> 57:51.680
I mean, the kids at the gym,
just nobody...

57:51.763 --> 57:55.851
Just recreational, little, you know,
Jersey Shore douchebags I see at the gym,

57:55.934 --> 57:59.146
they're all juiced up to the max
and what have you.

57:59.229 --> 58:01.899
Everybody does it.
Everybody does it.

58:01.982 --> 58:04.151
So why they target bodybuilder?

58:04.234 --> 58:07.821
Because bodybuilders,
they take off their clothes.

58:07.905 --> 58:10.782
They're in their shorts or trunks
on stage.

58:10.866 --> 58:15.162
Obviously, the field physique
is much different than a normal person.

58:15.245 --> 58:17.873
So people don't see hard work
and effort that go behind.

58:17.956 --> 58:20.209
You can take enhancers,
you can take this and that,

58:20.292 --> 58:23.921
but at the same time, you can't buy
the hard work that people put.

59:08.757 --> 59:10.717

[King] Bodybuilding is so mental.

01:01:42.244 --> 01:01:45.289
That's what you have to do, you have to
sacrifice everything in your life.

01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:50.794

Bodybuilding is 80% mental.

[Vlad] <i>Before the competition,</i>

01:02:10.063 --> 01:02:12.816
<i>bodybuilders go through a cutting phase.</i>

01:02:13.734 --> 01:02:18.280
<i>It's a complex process that requires</i>
<i>balancing carbs, protein, water,</i>

01:02:18.363 --> 01:02:19.531
<i>and sodium intake.</i>

01:02:21.158 --> 01:02:23.744
<i>Each body reacts differently</i>
<i>to this process.</i>

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:27.998
<i>The adjustments in diet and water intake</i>

<i>Most bodybuilders don't consume</i>

[Jay] You've got to be
in great condition,

01:03:43.824 --> 01:03:46.577
you have to be able to pose right,
and everything has to flow.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:51.415
The symmetry has to be like, you know,
where you create that V taper

01:03:51.498 --> 01:03:54.960
and you have round muscle bellies
and, you know, it's defined,

01:03:55.043 --> 01:03:58.589
and, you know, whoever poses
and shows off their strong points

01:03:58.672 --> 01:04:01.049
and hides their weaknesses

01:04:01.133 --> 01:04:03.093

01:05:20.838 --> 01:05:23.257
the membership in the gyms come down,

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:26.552
they get blasted in social media,

01:05:26.635 --> 01:05:29.680
the haters will come out and they will
take away everything they have.

01:05:29.763 --> 01:05:32.266
So to them it's life or death
for these Iranians.

01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:34.017
It's everything to them.

01:05:34.101 --> 01:05:36.395
You know, it's everything to them.
It's the passion.

01:05:36.478 --> 01:05:37.771
It's so strong.

01:05:37.855 --> 01:05:40.440
That's why they get upset
and they go and they cry

01:05:40.524 --> 01:05:41.859
and they do this and they do that.

01:05:41.942 --> 01:05:44.194
There's always gonna be controversy
no matter who wins.

01:05:44.278 --> 01:05:46.196
The only one that's happy is the guy
that wins the show

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.698
or the female that wins the show.

01:05:47.781 --> 01:05:50.367
Everybody else is just always gonna be
unhappy from second on down.

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:51.618
So, what can you do?

01:05:53.537 --> 01:05:54.705
Tired.

01:05:55.706 --> 01:05:56.832
Finished.

01:05:56.915 --> 01:05:58.292
[indistinct chatter]

01:06:01.336 --> 01:06:04.006
[Vlad] <i>Placing seventh was</i>
<i>not the result he wanted.</i>

01:06:04.673 --> 01:06:07.843
<i>But Rafael is at peace</i>
<i>with a placement.</i>

01:06:08.635 --> 01:06:12.764
<i>He achieved his goal and made</i>
<i>the pro debut in the world arena.</i>

01:06:19.771 --> 01:06:22.941
<i>For Varinder,</i>
<i>the result wasn't as expected.</i>

01:06:23.901 --> 01:06:27.196
<i>Being a vegetarian puts him at</i>
<i>a disadvantage for gaining muscle mass,</i>

01:06:27.279 --> 01:06:28.655
<i>and he knows it.</i>

01:06:28.739 --> 01:06:31.366
<i>But he's determined</i>
<i>to continue his career</i>

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:33.911
<i>and rep his nation around the world.</i>

01:06:34.953 --> 01:06:36.872
[Sharu] From front,
Varinder is very good.

01:06:36.955 --> 01:06:39.124
As good as any other guy
in the world right now.

01:06:39.208 --> 01:06:40.834
His problem's always in the back.

01:06:40.918 --> 01:06:43.545
The hamstring and the back cut-up thing.

01:06:43.629 --> 01:06:46.423
Give him like six months or one year,

01:06:46.507 --> 01:06:48.967
you will see a new Varinder
coming up.

01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:02.856
[Vlad] <i>A day before the New York Pro,</i>

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:05.067
<i>Regan pays a visit to Steve Weinberger,</i>

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:07.319
<i>a head IFBB judge.</i>

01:07:07.819 --> 01:07:11.240
<i>A visit is a tradition of sorts</i>
<i>among the top pros</i>

01:07:11.323 --> 01:07:14.910
<i>who want to hear an honest and credible</i>
<i>opinion about their progress,</i>

01:07:15.661 --> 01:07:17.996
<i>because Steve doesn't sugar-coat.</i>

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.916
<i>His opinions are usually sharp</i>
<i>and to the point.</i>

01:07:20.999 --> 01:07:24.253
<i>However, suddenly Regan</i>
<i>has an announcement of his own.</i>

01:07:24.336 --> 01:07:28.006
Hey, Steve, there's some big news.
I'm doing Classic.

01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:29.258
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:07:29.341 --> 01:07:31.969
[Steve] I thought he was going to be
an amazing Open competitor.

01:07:32.052 --> 01:07:34.721
Big size, great shape,
really good conditioning.

01:07:34.805 --> 01:07:39.226
I thought, this is a guy that could be
really a top Mr. Olympia contender.

01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:42.104
Then he told me that he's doing
Classic Physique.

01:07:42.187 --> 01:07:43.397
And I was pretty much shocked

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.774
'cause I thought he'd be
one of the new big stars.

01:07:45.858 --> 01:07:47.943
I can't believe he lost that much mass.

01:07:48.026 --> 01:07:50.737
If you would have told me
the day before he's coming in

01:07:50.821 --> 01:07:53.407
and tell me he's not gonna be
doing the Open,

01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:55.367
and he's gonna be doing Classic
and he's gonna win,

01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:56.952
I would say you're out of your mind.

01:07:57.035 --> 01:07:58.537
I wouldn't think it was gonna happen.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:01.164
-Gonna be dangerous also.
-Yeah. Thank you.

01:08:02.207 --> 01:08:03.500
I just think it's...

01:08:04.293 --> 01:08:05.836
I think I have a better shot.

01:08:05.919 --> 01:08:07.004
-I think...
-I agree.

01:08:07.087 --> 01:08:09.548
[Regan] Some of these guys,
all the power to them,

01:08:09.631 --> 01:08:12.342
they look amazing, but some guys,
I just don't aspire to look like that.

01:08:12.426 --> 01:08:14.261
You know,
I don't want to be that big.

01:08:14.344 --> 01:08:17.014
Like I don't wanna be 330 or 320.

01:08:17.096 --> 01:08:20.725
You're your own person, I guess,
and you gotta bring what you like.

01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:24.854
You know, so even, I mean,
if the judges want me at 300,

01:08:24.938 --> 01:08:27.733
I don't know if I'd even go to 300
'cause I just, "A,"

01:08:27.816 --> 01:08:30.484
it wouldn't be healthy for me,
I wouldn't feel good,

01:08:30.569 --> 01:08:34.907
and, "B," that's probably not
the physique that I want to be like.

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:40.037
I think it seems like Classic Physique
is gonna be the most popular thing.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.456
That's what I see, 'cause
you gotta think there's so many...

01:08:42.538 --> 01:08:45.792
Like there's so many more people
who could be on that level

01:08:45.876 --> 01:08:48.629
of like "genetically gifted"
and work ethic and everything,

01:08:48.712 --> 01:08:52.925
but there's, like the Phil Heath
is like the one in like... a billion.

01:08:53.008 --> 01:08:55.719
Anyway, the Classic Physique
turned out to be

01:08:55.801 --> 01:08:58.680
one of our fastest exploding divisions.

01:08:58.764 --> 01:09:00.599
I think it's definitely not
an easy way out.

01:09:00.682 --> 01:09:03.352
It's different, I guess, in many ways.

01:09:03.435 --> 01:09:06.604
But I know for a fact, they train
with a professional Open bodybuilder

01:09:06.688 --> 01:09:07.773
every single day.

01:09:07.856 --> 01:09:10.692
We're still all working just as hard
and there's sacrifices

01:09:10.776 --> 01:09:13.654
that every division is gonna have to make
in this, nothing's easy.

01:09:13.737 --> 01:09:16.240
If you don't give it 100%,
then you won't be successful.

01:09:16.323 --> 01:09:17.823
[Jim] There's no easy way out.

01:09:17.908 --> 01:09:19.952
That's insulting
to the Classic Physique guys.

01:09:20.035 --> 01:09:22.328
If you look at the group
of Classic Physique guys,

01:09:22.412 --> 01:09:24.706
there's nothing easy about winning
a pro show anymore.

01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:25.957
These guys are for real.

01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:28.710
I mean, they train just like
the bodybuilders, even harder.

01:09:29.545 --> 01:09:32.214
[Stanislas] A Classic Physique
is all about balance to me.

01:09:32.296 --> 01:09:33.465
Balance and conditioning.

01:09:33.549 --> 01:09:34.675
To me, it's a Greek statue.

01:09:34.758 --> 01:09:38.554
You want to showcase the physique.
It's not just overall pure mass.

01:09:38.636 --> 01:09:40.389
When Classic Physique is balanced first.

01:09:40.471 --> 01:09:43.600
Classic represents the artsy side.

01:09:44.225 --> 01:09:47.062
It is showing you straight-up art
in Classic.

01:09:47.145 --> 01:09:49.356
It's very cool to watch,
but after a while,

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:51.859
if these are the same routines
over and over...

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:56.363
Regan's gonna be Mr. Olympia
Men's Open at some point.

01:09:56.446 --> 01:10:00.909
I think he's a one-and-done guy
in this Classic contest he's doing now,

01:10:00.993 --> 01:10:03.453
'cause I know he's gonna have trouble
bringing the weight down.

01:10:03.537 --> 01:10:06.498
There's a lot of potential there
 to be a Men's Open bodybuilder.

01:10:06.582 --> 01:10:09.251
And a lot of bodybuilders don't make it
in the Open class,

01:10:09.334 --> 01:10:10.919
so they fall down into Classic.

01:10:11.003 --> 01:10:12.045
Well, guess what?

01:10:12.129 --> 01:10:13.380
The waist isn't small enough,

01:10:13.463 --> 01:10:16.133
or the lines aren't good enough
and then they're pushed out.

01:10:16.216 --> 01:10:19.678
In five years, watch the comeback
in the sport of bodybuilding

01:10:19.761 --> 01:10:20.804
in the Men's Open side.

01:10:24.766 --> 01:10:27.769
-[Victoria] You trying to make it higher?
-[man] I just wanna see your legs...

01:10:27.853 --> 01:10:29.980
[Victoria laughs]

01:10:30.063 --> 01:10:31.398
[Victoria] Imagine that.

01:10:31.481 --> 01:10:34.484
[man] I'm telling you right now,
It's extremely light.

01:10:34.568 --> 01:10:36.653
-[Victoria speaking indistinctly]
-Yeah.

01:10:37.779 --> 01:10:39.573
[man] Let's see the hamstring from behind.

01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:49.333
-You can feel now, I mean...
-[Regan] I can feel them.

01:10:49.416 --> 01:10:52.920
[indistinct shouting]

01:10:53.545 --> 01:10:55.756
-[man 1] Pull straight in.
-[man 2] Stay right there.

01:10:57.174 --> 01:10:58.133
[man] Thank you.

01:11:00.802 --> 01:11:04.181
I know I've worked so hard
like for the competition,

01:11:04.264 --> 01:11:05.891
and that I'm just, I'm ready, you know.

01:11:05.974 --> 01:11:09.353
Like, now it's time to just display
what I've worked for.

01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:12.773
-[man] Go, Greene!
-[woman] Let's go, babe!

01:11:12.856 --> 01:11:14.525
[scattered cheering]

01:11:22.616 --> 01:11:24.034
[woman] Go, Regan!

01:11:25.911 --> 01:11:28.705
[scattered cheering and applause]

01:11:29.248 --> 01:11:30.916
Go, Regan!

01:11:34.044 --> 01:11:35.671
[cheering and applause]

01:11:37.172 --> 01:11:38.423
[man] Yeah, Regan!

01:11:38.507 --> 01:11:39.758
[scattered cheering]

01:11:39.842 --> 01:11:41.927
[woman] Go, Regan!

01:11:42.803 --> 01:11:45.639
Go, Regan! Flex!

01:12:10.789 --> 01:12:13.709
[Vlad] <i>A first-place finish proved</i>
<i>that switching to Classic</i>

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:15.627
<i>was the right decision for Regan.</i>

01:12:15.711 --> 01:12:19.464
<i>But the stakes would only get higher</i>
<i>and competition fierce</i>

01:12:19.548 --> 01:12:21.967
<i>as he's now part</i>
<i>of the fastest-growing division</i>

01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:23.260
<i>in the pro league.</i>

01:13:02.591 --> 01:13:05.427
[in Russian] When I met my wife,
she always supported me.

01:13:06.428 --> 01:13:10.390
Now we have one daughter,
but we want two more children.

01:13:10.474 --> 01:13:15.604
So, I'm working now for their future.

01:13:16.396 --> 01:13:19.399
So, family is not an obstacle.

01:13:19.483 --> 01:13:23.320
On the contrary, they motivate me
and encourage me.

01:13:23.403 --> 01:13:26.240
When I was in the orphanage,

01:13:26.323 --> 01:13:30.244
I promised myself never to let
my own children end up there.

01:13:34.039 --> 01:13:37.626
I started preparing.

01:13:41.338 --> 01:13:43.590
You know, it's an important competition.

01:13:45.217 --> 01:13:47.052
I still have some time.

01:13:47.135 --> 01:13:49.763
You can do it, but you need to pay
attention to certain areas.

01:13:49.847 --> 01:13:52.349
-You know what I'm talking about.
-I'm working on it.

01:13:52.432 --> 01:13:58.522
You're ready, but you just need
to improve on those little details.

01:13:58.605 --> 01:14:01.316
What does Timur say about
going to America?

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:07.364
Not much, just says to prepare.
My motivation is through the roof.

01:14:07.447 --> 01:14:08.907
Yeah, it's the next level.

01:14:08.991 --> 01:14:13.328
Of course I realize
I'll have to work twice as much.

01:14:13.412 --> 01:14:16.290
IFBB is an advanced level.

01:14:16.373 --> 01:14:22.504
I can't even imagine how it will be
if you win the Arnold Classic.

01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:30.220
And imagine if you become
an overall champion?

01:15:33.909 --> 01:15:36.203
[coach] Two-time... Arnold...

01:15:36.828 --> 01:15:39.164
Classic... champion...

01:15:39.706 --> 01:15:43.710
Brandon... Hendrickson!

01:15:43.794 --> 01:15:46.213
-[Brandon straining]
-Come on, go.

01:15:56.598 --> 01:15:59.393
[Vlad] <i>We return to the Arnold Classic</i>
<i>in Columbus, Ohio,</i>

01:16:00.269 --> 01:16:03.021
<i>where every year,</i>
<i>about a hundred thousand people gather</i>

01:16:03.105 --> 01:16:05.649
<i>for the fitness expo and the competitions.</i>

01:16:07.067 --> 01:16:08.569
<i>Everything seems familiar.</i>

01:16:08.652 --> 01:16:11.822
<i>Crowds of eager fans,</i>
<i>cold March winds,</i>

01:16:11.905 --> 01:16:14.283

01:16:14.366 --> 01:16:16.535
<i>from all over the world.</i>

01:16:16.618 --> 01:16:19.705
<i>But for the competitors,</i>
<i>there is no time for excitement.</i>

01:16:27.838 --> 01:16:29.423
[water running]

01:16:29.506 --> 01:16:34.803
[in Russian] When people go to the US
for the first time,

01:16:34.887 --> 01:16:39.600
they are impressed because
people dream of going there,

01:16:39.683 --> 01:16:44.062
because everyone says
it's an athlete's paradise.

01:16:44.146 --> 01:16:47.482
A different life,

01:16:47.566 --> 01:16:52.779
compared to the one in Uzbekistan.

01:16:52.863 --> 01:16:56.158
We went there to compete.

01:16:56.241 --> 01:16:58.535
We went there to win.

01:16:58.619 --> 01:17:03.832
To raise our flag.
To let people know about us.

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:06.835
-[in Russian] Oh, Misha, hi.
-[in Russian] Hi.

01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:11.632
-How are you doing?
-OK.

01:17:11.715 --> 01:17:15.469
-Misha, how are you?
-I'm OK.

01:17:15.552 --> 01:17:17.971
-Did you get enough sleep?
-Yep.

01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:26.939
Look, it's started.

01:17:27.022 --> 01:17:29.191
The final stage.

01:17:31.777 --> 01:17:34.821
The calves this time are good.

01:17:34.905 --> 01:17:37.032
Oh, look. Flex it.

01:17:40.536 --> 01:17:44.581
-Check it out, it's cutting.
-Well done.

01:17:44.665 --> 01:17:48.502
You just gotta be calm,

01:17:48.585 --> 01:17:51.296
don't freak out.

01:17:51.839 --> 01:17:55.300
-Perhaps you'll get a pro card.
-Of course I will.

01:18:34.631 --> 01:18:36.466
[Vlad] <i>It's finally time.</i>

01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:39.178
<i>This is what they have been working for.</i>

01:18:39.636 --> 01:18:42.264
<i>Misha and the rest</i>
<i>of the amateur bodybuilders</i>

01:18:42.347 --> 01:18:45.392
<i>get compared during</i>
<i>a tedious prejudging round.</i>

01:18:46.602 --> 01:18:49.771
<i>Meanwhile, Ariel and Whitney</i>
<i>go through their prejudging,</i>

01:18:49.855 --> 01:18:51.315
<i>the physique round.</i>

01:19:15.047 --> 01:19:18.050
[Ariel] When I first came out,
the judges didn't even look at me.

01:19:18.133 --> 01:19:20.385
They were looking down,
they were like shuffling papers.

01:19:20.844 --> 01:19:23.013
There was only a couple judges
that were really looking at me.

01:19:23.555 --> 01:19:27.100
But, um, yeah, I mean, that's like
not a great feeling

01:19:27.184 --> 01:19:28.936
'cause you worked really hard for this.

01:19:29.019 --> 01:19:31.104
I'm not really sure
what they were expecting from me,

01:19:31.188 --> 01:19:33.565
but I think I did the best that I could.

01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:36.860
So I just want to go out there
in a routine and kind of kill it now.

01:19:36.944 --> 01:19:37.986
[chuckles]

01:19:59.091 --> 01:20:00.676
[indistinct chatter]

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:22.781
[commentator] Here we are
with the Men's Physique 2018.

01:20:22.865 --> 01:20:26.702
Big smiles, small waists.
That's what it's about, boys.

01:20:27.494 --> 01:20:29.997
[Vlad] <i>While the first round</i>
<i>of Women's Fitness</i>

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.292
<i>may only be worth 30%</i>
<i>of their overall score,</i>

01:20:33.375 --> 01:20:36.920
<i>prejudging for Men's Physique division</i>
<i>is everything.</i>

01:20:37.004 --> 01:20:39.298
<i>This is the round</i>
<i>where athletes get compared</i>

01:20:39.381 --> 01:20:41.925
<i>and continually narrowed down</i>
<i>to the best,</i>

01:20:42.718 --> 01:20:46.305
<i>until top competitors are</i>
<i>next to each other center stage.</i>

01:20:46.388 --> 01:20:48.307
-[commentator] But you notice these guys.
-[emcee] <i>5 and 16, switch.</i>

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:50.976
You can see the ones that really train
their legs through their shorts.

01:20:51.059 --> 01:20:53.353
Right there, number 16,
Brandon Hendrickson, being one of them.

01:20:53.437 --> 01:20:56.523
Those shorts are tight, his quads
are busting through those things.

01:20:56.607 --> 01:20:59.193
Respect to that.
Gotta balance that body out.

01:20:59.276 --> 01:21:02.613
[Vlad] <i>Emotions run high</i>
<i>and stress is always present,</i>

01:21:02.696 --> 01:21:05.949
<i>as the athletes try to inch</i>
<i>their way closer to the judges</i>

01:21:06.408 --> 01:21:09.578
<i>in the attempt to make themselves</i>
<i>look bigger and more defined.</i>

01:21:09.661 --> 01:21:13.707
<i>Everything is on the line with the few</i>
<i>minutes they have on this stage.</i>

01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:14.958
[emcee] <i>Andre, move up.</i>

01:21:16.627 --> 01:21:20.172
I know, myself, I don't focus on people.

01:21:20.255 --> 01:21:21.715
Like when I prep.

01:21:21.798 --> 01:21:24.843
My focus is on beating everyone,
so how am I focusing on Brandon?

01:21:24.927 --> 01:21:26.637
I'm here to beat everyone.
I'm focusing on me.

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.684
[Vlad] <i>The judges narrow it down</i>
<i>to the top three physiques</i>

01:21:32.768 --> 01:21:33.977
<i>and compare them.</i>

01:21:34.061 --> 01:21:35.854
<i>While they know they've placed well,</i>

01:21:35.938 --> 01:21:38.732
<i>they have to wait</i>
<i>until the awards ceremony</i>

01:21:38.815 --> 01:21:40.317
<i>to see who gets the gold.</i>

01:21:50.327 --> 01:21:51.620
[speaking indistinctly]

01:21:56.542 --> 01:21:58.919
[Ariel] I feel like I'm only
competing against myself.

01:21:59.002 --> 01:22:02.256
I never go into a show saying,
"I have to win

01:22:02.339 --> 01:22:05.467
or I have to do this, I have to do that,"
because, at the end of the day,

01:22:05.551 --> 01:22:09.179
if I do the best that I can do,
I can't be any happier with that.

01:22:46.592 --> 01:22:51.597
If you want to be at the elite level,
you go all in.

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.183
And you give it everything you've got.

01:22:54.266 --> 01:22:57.060
And you attack it every single day.

01:22:57.144 --> 01:23:01.315
It takes a very specific person
to be at the top.

01:23:02.524 --> 01:23:06.361
If you're not cut out for it,
don't get in.

01:23:06.445 --> 01:23:09.615
The people who are at the top,
they don't need to talk about it.

01:23:09.698 --> 01:23:12.117
They're not complaining
about anything.

01:23:12.201 --> 01:23:14.912
They're working, they are grinding.

01:23:14.995 --> 01:23:20.626
They are doing everything that is required
and that's necessary to get there.

01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:23.378
But people aren't willing to do that.

01:23:23.462 --> 01:23:28.008
Because it's not easy to be in it.
It's not easy to be at the top.

01:23:28.091 --> 01:23:31.595
This is a serious thing.
There's too many serious athletes.

01:23:31.678 --> 01:23:35.349
There's too many people who are
so dedicated and want it so bad.

01:23:35.432 --> 01:23:39.019
Those are the people who get it,
those are the people who deserve it.

01:23:39.102 --> 01:23:40.812
You have to be relentless.

01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:44.066
You have to be fearless
in everything you want.

01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:49.363
Those people who want it know it,
and there is nothing stopping them.

01:24:09.174 --> 01:24:10.759
[applause]

01:24:23.939 --> 01:24:27.609
[no voice]

01:25:00.684 --> 01:25:02.728
[in Russian] Arnold Schwarzenegger
then tells me,

01:25:04.479 --> 01:25:06.648
"Where are you from?",
I say "Uzbekistan."

01:25:06.732 --> 01:25:12.863
He says, "How many years
have you been in training?"

01:25:13.906 --> 01:25:16.992
Everyone is keeping silent for a moment,

01:25:17.075 --> 01:25:19.286
and I say, "I don't speak English."

01:25:19.369 --> 01:25:21.747
And the audience went wild.

01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:24.541
They were expecting me
to say something else, probably.

01:25:33.091 --> 01:25:35.302
[indistinct chatter]

01:25:48.899 --> 01:25:49.983
[woman] Whoo!

01:25:50.067 --> 01:25:52.069
[indistinct announcements over PA]

01:25:54.404 --> 01:25:56.490
[scattered applause]

01:26:00.369 --> 01:26:04.331
[emcee] <i>And the winner</i>
<i>of $1,500 for third place,</i>

01:26:04.414 --> 01:26:06.124
<i>Brandon Hendrickson.</i>

01:26:08.961 --> 01:26:12.923
This is the end, we've been working for
this moment, because I want the titles.

01:26:22.432 --> 01:26:27.187
You cannot be champion without
difficult times and without losing.

01:26:27.271 --> 01:26:30.232
It's experience.
It's great experience.

01:26:30.315 --> 01:26:33.569
And without this experience,
you cannot become a champ.

01:26:33.652 --> 01:26:37.447
When you just got trophy very fast
for one or two years,

01:26:37.531 --> 01:26:39.950
it doesn't make you stronger person.

01:26:40.033 --> 01:26:44.246
It doesn't make you real champion
with good future.

01:29:19.109 --> 01:29:21.111
[no voice]

01:29:32.998 --> 01:29:36.126
[Brandon] At first, when I told him that I
wanted to pursue bodybuilding,

01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:38.378
all my dad was worried about was like,

01:29:38.462 --> 01:29:40.756
"What about retirement?
What about insurance?"

01:29:40.839 --> 01:29:43.509
You know, he's worrying about the stuff
that I wasn't thinking about,

01:29:43.592 --> 01:29:47.221
and then I started competing
and doing well and...

01:29:47.304 --> 01:29:50.098
he saw that I was becoming
successful in the sport.

01:29:50.182 --> 01:29:53.060
And so he was starting to believe
in my vision a lot more.

01:30:08.283 --> 01:30:10.494
[Vlad] <i>The pursuit</i>
<i>of the perfect physique</i>

01:30:10.577 --> 01:30:13.163
<i>is what often unites the men and women</i>

01:30:13.247 --> 01:30:15.624
<i>who dedicate their lives to the iron.</i>

01:30:16.291 --> 01:30:20.045
<i>Their path might be discouraging at times,</i>
<i>and even dangerous.</i>

01:30:20.921 --> 01:30:26.176
<i>At the end of the day, most know</i>
<i>that achieving perfection is not possible.</i>

01:30:26.552 --> 01:30:28.220
<i>But that doesn't stop them.</i>

01:30:30.055 --> 01:30:33.308
<i>And whether they live</i>
<i>in the East or West...</i>

01:30:34.142 --> 01:30:35.644
<i>having little or much resource,</i>

01:30:38.272 --> 01:30:41.483
<i>that ultimately has little to do</i>
<i>with their dream</i>

01:30:42.401 --> 01:30:44.486
<i>as they will always find a way.</i>

01:30:53.036 --> 01:30:55.372
I heard Lee Haney say this
when I was a teenager.

01:30:55.455 --> 01:30:58.542
He said, he said, uh,
"Great champions don't come back.

01:30:58.625 --> 01:31:01.628
They focus and capture their now,

01:31:01.712 --> 01:31:04.464
and they move on with their development."

01:31:04.548 --> 01:31:07.342
There's many, many more things
that you're supposed to do

01:31:07.426 --> 01:31:09.595
and accomplish in your lifetime.

01:31:09.678 --> 01:31:10.846
So, yeah...

01:31:12.472 --> 01:31:15.559
Great champions don't come back,
they be back.
