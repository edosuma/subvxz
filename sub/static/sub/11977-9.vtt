  Ethan:  <i>Previously on</i> rogue...

00:07.875 --> 00:09.441
      Harper:  <i>I found the ring.</i>

00:09.443 --> 00:11.043
    I can't marry you, jack.

00:14.714 --> 00:15.848
          (camera clicking)

00:16.449 --> 00:19.685
              (beeping)

00:23.323 --> 00:25.557
    Lloyd roberts?
    We have a warrant
    to search the premises.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.028
          Now, what's this?

00:29.030 --> 00:31.130
      -You sons of bitches.
      -Put your hands
      behind your back?

00:31.132 --> 00:33.065
        General howard.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.200
    You're under arrest for
    conspiracy to commit murder
    and grand larceny.

00:35.202 --> 00:39.304
    The general will resign
    his post and quietly retire.

00:39.306 --> 00:40.472
          I cut a deal.

00:40.474 --> 00:44.209
    You cut a fucking deal.
    You son of a bitch!

00:44.211 --> 00:45.477
      Richmond bought the story?

00:45.479 --> 00:48.247
    General howard confirmed
    everything you told her.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.748
      They're gonna release
      you, conditional

00:49.750 --> 00:52.518
  Upon you helping them with
  their prosecution of roberts.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.219
      What you wanna talk about?

00:54.221 --> 00:56.188
      You still wanna deal
      on the counterfeit money?

00:56.190 --> 00:58.023
        Depends on what
        you have to give me.

00:58.025 --> 01:02.961
    How about I give you marlon
    and my fucking lawyer,
    marty stein?

03:10.723 --> 03:13.025
          So your brother
          took care of you?

03:13.027 --> 03:15.194
        -One way to put it.
        -What's another way?

03:16.362 --> 03:17.462
    You wouldn't understand.

03:18.164 --> 03:19.731
            Try me.

03:21.968 --> 03:24.303
          All right, um...

03:24.305 --> 03:26.805
      Okay, all them dealers
      out there,

03:26.807 --> 03:28.807
      What they do when you
      good and young, huh?

03:28.809 --> 03:30.742
          Practically givin'
          that shit away,

03:30.744 --> 03:32.644
          Like charity.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.379
      It ain't no
      motherfucking charity.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.480
          It's a scheme.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.583
    And marlon took care of me.

03:39.352 --> 03:40.886
        So what, he made you
        an addict?

03:42.322 --> 03:45.157
      He made me depend on him,

03:45.159 --> 03:47.993
    And now he's gonna judge me
    'cause I can't stand
    on my own two feet?

03:47.995 --> 03:51.230
  Fuck that.
  There ain't never been
  no addict without no hustler.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.966
      That shit's universal.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.003
    Even marlon got his connect.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.204
            Who's that?

03:59.206 --> 04:01.240
        That'd be marty now,
        wouldn't it?

04:02.675 --> 04:04.109
        You think marlon

04:04.111 --> 04:05.944
        Got to where he's at
        on his own?

04:07.347 --> 04:09.748
      He made his way
      jonesin' for stein's shit.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.517
  Are you telling me marty stein
  is a drug dealer?

04:12.519 --> 04:14.119
      Stein ain't no dealer.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.555
          Stein's a kingpin.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.857
        And marlon's his boy
        on the street.

04:20.392 --> 04:22.761
      I can give you shit
      they been at together

04:24.197 --> 04:25.497
          Going back years.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.870
    All right, mrs. Officer,
    your turn.

04:32.872 --> 04:34.273
        What's the plan?

05:00.066 --> 05:01.733
      What happened to staying
      in the cabin?

05:01.735 --> 05:03.669
        I was in the cabin.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.570
          Your pal stein
          sent a car for me.

05:05.572 --> 05:09.074
  Said you were in the can,
  I should come down here
  and get you.

05:09.076 --> 05:12.344
      -What the hell's going on?
      -Listen, I wanna
      apologize for

05:12.346 --> 05:14.846
      -What I said to you.
      -Oh, shit, come on. I was
     talking a lot of shit, too.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.415
        -I'm sorry, dad.
        -So am I.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.317
      -Let's go have a beer.
      Yeah.
      -Beer?

05:18.319 --> 05:20.152
    Is it 10:45 in the morning?
    11:00?

05:20.154 --> 05:21.653
        Late enough for me.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.555
    Something a little stiffer.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.364
        Are you going to get
        dressed today?

05:35.168 --> 05:38.003
        -Marty, you won.
        -Yeah.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.338
          (door bell rings)

05:39.340 --> 05:40.605
          I'm not home.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.283
        Betsy: Hey, marlon.

05:52.452 --> 05:53.819
            Oh, christ.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.288
          I know he's here.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.123
          I'm not home.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.659
    Yeah, betsy already told me.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.128
          -Thank you, betsy.
          -You're welcome.

06:05.665 --> 06:07.399
        I been calling you.

06:07.401 --> 06:10.035
    -Yeah? Anybody pick up?
    -No.

06:12.638 --> 06:13.872
      Look, man, I need a favor.

06:17.477 --> 06:20.212
    -What do you want?
    -I'm having a supply issue.

06:23.983 --> 06:25.183
            Oh, my, god.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.985
    Seems like all I ever do

06:26.987 --> 06:28.320
      Is fix your fuck-ups.

06:28.322 --> 06:30.822
          Revenue's through
          the floor, marlon.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.591
        -Way to go.
        -It's temporary, man.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.092
              Yeah?

06:34.094 --> 06:36.528
      We're taking a beating
      and yet here you are
      telling me

06:36.530 --> 06:37.929
    That you can't even fix

06:37.931 --> 06:39.898
      A simple supply issue

06:39.900 --> 06:41.400
  Without me holding your hand.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.674
        I never really liked you
          very much, marty.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.410
      -Yeah, well, get in line.
      -I'm serious.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.345
          You know,
          when we first met,

06:53.347 --> 06:56.114
      I thought you were some
      white-guilt motherfucker.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.016
      It's called pro bono.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.584
      I needed it for my resume.

07:01.187 --> 07:04.356
    I figured I'd take advantage
      of you, use you a bit,

07:04.358 --> 07:07.225
        Get mine and get out
        of the game.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.894
      But looking back with
      a little perspective,

07:08.896 --> 07:11.530
      You know, your friendship
      kinda saved me.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.765
        'cause the homies
        that I grew up with,

07:13.767 --> 07:15.434
    The streets made them a man.

07:16.068 --> 07:17.903
        I mean, that's okay.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.372
      But me, I had a whole
      'nother level

07:20.374 --> 07:21.706
          Of schoolin', man.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.975
              I had you.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.445
      You taught me how to dance
      in the shadows.

07:26.447 --> 07:29.815
    I mean, hell, if it
    weren't for you, maybe
    I wouldn't even be here.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.553
      I got a lot of shit
      hanging by you, marty.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.389
      People think I'm your
      slave boy, like,

07:37.391 --> 07:41.226
      I don't remember the fuck
      where I came from.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.361
      It's the kind of shit that
      used to get to me.

07:47.066 --> 07:50.135
          Then I remembered
          one cold hard fact
          about you.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.103
          Yeah, what's that?

07:52.105 --> 07:54.539
      That you the blackest
      motherfucker I know.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.046
          But sometimes,

08:02.949 --> 08:04.883
      I think we ain't friends.

08:06.452 --> 08:08.954
  Maybe you don't have friends.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.723
    Maybe you think you
    just got fucking employees,
    or something.

08:15.828 --> 08:19.264
        And you got this way
        you go about you,

08:19.266 --> 08:21.666
      We confusing that shit
      with something else.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.103
  You got any thoughts on that?

08:28.875 --> 08:30.108
            Let me know.

08:31.878 --> 08:33.010
            Marlon.

08:33.645 --> 08:34.846
              What's up?

08:35.448 --> 08:37.182
          You're right.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.783
          We're not friends.

09:16.822 --> 09:18.256
              Greg?

09:21.494 --> 09:23.395
    Can you unlock that for me?

09:23.397 --> 09:24.763
  Yeah, I'll take a crack at it.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.164
            Thanks.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.266
  Just between you and I, okay?

09:28.268 --> 09:30.235
      -You got it, deakins.
      -Thanks.

10:39.338 --> 10:41.306
    -She likes you.
    -I'm sure that sent

10:41.308 --> 10:44.609
  A whirl of threesome scenarios
  through your narrow-minded
  little brain.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.978
    All morning, I ain't get
    an inch of work done.

10:48.914 --> 10:51.416
    How are things standing
    with you and jack?

10:51.418 --> 10:53.318
            I dunno.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.421
    I'm taking it harder
    than I thought I would.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.590
      Just, kind of all over the
      place right now, you know.

10:58.592 --> 11:00.659
        Just confused about
        a bunch of shit.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.595
          Look at that,

11:03.597 --> 11:06.031
        -Harper deakins has
        emotions after all.
            -Go figure.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.067
    Well, if you need anything,

11:09.702 --> 11:11.269
        You let me know.

11:12.638 --> 11:15.140
      Actually, I'm thinking
      I might take the day.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.641

          my head straight.

          over my shoulder

12:01.755 --> 12:02.987

12:02.989 --> 12:04.723

12:28.048 --> 12:29.514
      -No, no.
      -Well, I think you should
      get one.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.449
        -Oh, do you now?
        -Yeah.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.551
      Do you have a girlfriend?
      You got a couple of dames
        running around?

12:33.553 --> 12:36.187
  -If I wanted a girlfriend I'd
  have one real fast, trust me.
            -Oh, yeah?

12:36.189 --> 12:38.256
  Yeah, I got plenty of cupcakes
  hanging around my house.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.125
      (laughing)
      did you say cupcakes?

12:40.127 --> 12:41.693
          Like it's the '50s.

12:41.695 --> 12:42.927
        You got some widows

12:42.929 --> 12:44.629
      Chasing your wrinkled
      old ass around?

12:44.631 --> 12:46.397
        -I got all kinds of
        possibilities, kid.
            -Okay.

12:46.399 --> 12:50.101
        All kinds, all kinds
        of possibilities.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.704
      Why don't you take
      a look over
      your shoulder for me?

12:52.706 --> 12:54.873
          To the left
          hanging out there.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.041
      What do you think of that,
      hmm?

12:57.043 --> 12:58.743
      That's something for you.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.646
      -That's what you call
      trouble on the hoof, kid.
      -Oh, bullshit.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.381
      -Nothing but trouble.
      Nothing but trouble.
            -Yeah.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.984
        I can spot it
        across the room,
        clear from here.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.620
  -It's not what I need
  in my life right now.
  -What don't you go over there

13:08.622 --> 13:10.955
    And show me how
    you do your stuff, hmm?

13:10.957 --> 13:14.092
  And you can tell her all about
  your brush with death
  at the grocery store.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.895
      At my age, every day
      is a brush with death.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.296
      You know what I think?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.398
    I think you're all talk
    and no action.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.903
      Why don't you get
      your ass off the stool

13:24.905 --> 13:27.505
          And go over there
          and talk to her?
              Come on.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.775
  Why don't you drink your beer
  and mind your own business,
  for christ's sake?

13:30.777 --> 13:33.545
    -What's the matter with you?
    -Oh, my god, relax.

13:50.029 --> 13:51.663
              Holy shit.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.665
    Harper fucking deakins.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.300
          Young. Grier.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.368
      How come you never
      come by to visit, huh?

13:57.370 --> 13:59.437
      Run off to your
      fancy taskforce, leave us
      twisting in the wind?

13:59.439 --> 14:01.306
    -We got feelings, you know?
    -Yeah, we're not
    made of stone.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.141
        I miss you guys.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.943
          Just saying that
          'cause she needs
          something from us.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.444
        -No fucking way,
        I don't believe it.
        -I'm telling you,

14:06.446 --> 14:08.012
    That's what she's doing,
    the only reason she called.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.647
        Aw, say it ain't so.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.382
          Sorry, he's right.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.185
    -Shit, that's cold, deakins.
    -Real fucking cold.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.856
    I got a little op
    I need to keep off books.

14:18.457 --> 14:19.791
      I could use some help.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.659
      -Where are your people
      on this?
      -In the dark.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.394
            Why so?

14:23.396 --> 14:24.829
      I think I got a leak.

14:24.831 --> 14:27.365
    I need to keep things quiet,
    see what's what first.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.067
      Sounds like shit's
      falling apart over there.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.969
        Shoulda stayed
        on the winning team.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.238
      As much as I love the
      starsky and hutch routine,

14:33.240 --> 14:34.439
    Are you guys in or what?

14:36.242 --> 14:37.475
              Sure.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.344
    What else we gonna do?

14:39.346 --> 14:41.813
          Cross-city shit's
          running down 7%
          last couple weeks.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.648
   And we're fucking rock stars,
    might as well start doing

14:43.650 --> 14:45.216
      -Other people's work, too,
      right?
      -Mmm-hmm.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.651
    Just tell me one thing.

14:46.653 --> 14:49.487
          -What's that?
          -I'm hutch, right?

14:49.489 --> 14:51.556
      Fuck that shit, I'm hutch.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.424
    Oh, yeah, you're really
    fucking hutch.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.026
          Deakins, tell him,
          I'm hutch.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.494
      I'm like, the black hutch.

14:56.496 --> 14:57.762
            I'm blutch.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.597
          Right? Right?

14:59.599 --> 15:02.066
          I can get a blonde
          jheri curl.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.902
   Blow that shit in the breeze.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.470
            -Right?
            -Yeah.

15:07.673 --> 15:08.773
              Look.

15:08.775 --> 15:11.009
      All I'm trying to say

15:11.011 --> 15:13.177
          Is the kelly boys

15:13.179 --> 15:15.613
    Are notoriously virile guys.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.415
          -Yeah, really?
          -Yeah, yeah.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.450
      I mean,
      there's your grandfather,

15:19.452 --> 15:22.020
          He's 63 years old,
          he knocks up his

15:22.022 --> 15:23.855
          Dental hygiene-ist,

15:23.857 --> 15:25.223
              Hygienist,

15:25.225 --> 15:27.191
        -Hygiene-ist... Yeah.
        -Grandpa?

15:27.193 --> 15:30.061
    -You're kidding me.
    -Yeah, I know. She's picking
    around in his mouth,

15:30.063 --> 15:31.863
        With those last
        three teeth he had,

15:31.865 --> 15:33.865
      And he's trying to
      hustle her into the sack.

15:33.867 --> 15:36.868
    -How come I haven't heard
    about any of this?
    -Well...

15:36.870 --> 15:39.203
          -Because it didn't
          end too well.
          -No?

15:39.205 --> 15:41.105
      I mean, my point is...

15:41.107 --> 15:43.408
      I mean, here I am
      with the complete package,
      right?

15:43.410 --> 15:45.476
      I got it all working,

15:45.478 --> 15:47.612
    -You know, and
    so you can just imagine...
    -Right.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.647
        ...The kind of problems
        I could create.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.149
      -Right?
      -Oh, yeah, that'd be,

15:51.151 --> 15:52.884
    -That'd be fucking chaos.
    -That's right, that's right.

15:52.886 --> 15:55.219
      It's dangerous stuff,
      it's pandora's

15:55.221 --> 15:57.221
        Box kind of stuff.
        You lift the lid off

15:57.223 --> 15:59.624
      -And...
      -Okay, well, listen to me.
      Wait, wait, wait.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.226
    Pandora and her friends
    are about to leave.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.395
      Last chance, lothario.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.664
      I'm gonna have to do this,
      aren't I? I'm gonna have
      to prove this to you.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.900
    -I'd like to see your moves.
    -All right.

16:13.238 --> 16:14.906
            -All right.
            -Yeah.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.912
            Hello, little lady.

16:22.247 --> 16:24.015
      I'm fine, how are you?

16:38.931 --> 16:41.032
          What the fuck
          did you say to her?

16:41.034 --> 16:44.002
      Having a perfectly normal
      conversation and
      all of a sudden she says,

16:44.004 --> 16:45.937
  "you ever heard of feminism?"

16:45.939 --> 16:48.940
    I said, "yes, I know
    about feminism, what
    do you think, I'm ancient?"

16:48.942 --> 16:52.110
    She says,
    "well, what do you know
    about feminism?"

16:52.112 --> 16:54.112
        And I said, "well,

16:54.114 --> 16:56.114
      "what I know is that those

16:56.116 --> 16:59.117
      "broads always like to be
      on top," and she hits me.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.719
      Fucking broke my jaw,
      practically, for what?

17:04.656 --> 17:06.624
      Always bring your work
      home with you?

17:09.994 --> 17:11.963
    Why ain't we doing this
    at your office?

17:11.964 --> 17:13.498
        It's safer here.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.965
          Yeah, how's that?

17:14.968 --> 17:16.800
      People like your brother,
      people like marty,

17:16.803 --> 17:19.303
    They've got eyes and ears
    all over the place.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.705
    You ain't making me feel
    any better about this.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.208
    -Look, I've worked with
    a lot of...
    -Snitches?

17:24.210 --> 17:26.511
    -Ci's.
    -Call 'em what you want.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.880
          I've only ever had
          a couple go bad.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.481
        Still not making me
        feel better.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.150
    Both for the same issue.

17:33.485 --> 17:35.053
        Bitch couldn't keep
        her mouth shut?

17:37.990 --> 17:41.225
          Cl got cold feet.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.162
    They went back to their
    people, there's nothing
    I could do to protect them.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.668
      If you stick with me,
      I can protect you.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.670
      I can make sure that that

17:52.672 --> 17:54.172
      Doesn't happen again.

17:55.774 --> 17:57.575
          Okay, listen.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.744
    You better not fuck me over.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.080
          Marlon's gonna get
          what's comin',
          you promise me.

18:02.948 --> 18:04.415
              I promise.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.133
              Your dad?

18:23.702 --> 18:25.002
            Uh-huh. Here.

18:29.475 --> 18:32.577
  -So what do you need from me?
  -(knocking on door)

18:32.579 --> 18:34.679
            -Who's that?
            -It's okay.

18:39.651 --> 18:41.786
          -Hey.
          -Got the mic.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.921
        -And the warrant.
        -Okay, would someone
        mind telling me

18:43.923 --> 18:46.157
        What the fuck
        is going on in here?

18:46.159 --> 18:48.793
    Talia, these are my friends,
    dea agents.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.528
    Andrew grier, jeffrey young.

18:51.497 --> 18:52.697
        So fucking what?

18:53.899 --> 18:55.900
                So.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.402
      We need you to tell marlon
      you know where
      leo's hiding out.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.138
              I do?

19:00.140 --> 19:01.906
        We're gonna give you
        an address, where
        we'll be waiting.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.407
    The fuck that gonna achieve?

19:03.409 --> 19:05.409
      He shows up
      at the address, heavy,

19:05.411 --> 19:07.612
      Breaks in, we have a case,

19:07.614 --> 19:10.815
      -Attempted murder.
      -He sends somebody else,
      we got him on conspiracy.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.883
      Harper:
      Either way we got him.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.153
        So, I'm going to
        bug your phone.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.855
    Oh, no, fuck you,
    I'm not wearin' no wire,
    what if he finds it?

19:17.857 --> 19:21.292
    It's not a wire,
    it's a little mic we put
    inside your phone.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.861
      Marlon looks at the phone,
      he doesn't notice
      anything different.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.999
  I need to record you
  giving the address to marlon,

19:28.001 --> 19:29.834
      It helps prove intent.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.208
      If you wanna back out,
      now's the time.

19:53.458 --> 19:54.859
                Hey.

19:56.295 --> 19:57.428
                Hey.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.216
              Hey, t...

20:26.225 --> 20:28.659
     Look, I know, there's no...

20:28.661 --> 20:30.394
        There's no excuses.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.729
              Don't.

20:32.864 --> 20:34.165
          I pushed you.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.735
          (marlon sighs)

20:38.737 --> 20:40.071
          I'm really sorry.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.573
            I know.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.253
            What's this?

20:55.854 --> 20:57.088
        Peace offering.

20:59.591 --> 21:00.691
        Peace offering?

21:04.730 --> 21:07.865
      I've caused you
      a lot of trouble lately.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.201
      You know, even for me.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.103
      Just trying to, you know,

21:13.205 --> 21:14.639
          Make things right.

21:18.744 --> 21:19.877
            I, um...

21:20.712 --> 21:22.146
        A friend of mine

21:22.148 --> 21:25.049
    Said he knows leo's staying
    at his cousin's place.

21:29.254 --> 21:30.721
              Oh, yeah?

21:30.723 --> 21:32.123
                Mmm.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.393
    Thinks he might be tryin'
    to get outta town.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.461
            So what?

21:38.230 --> 21:39.664
                Mmm.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.532
  Thought you might wanna
  throw him a going away party.

21:50.609 --> 21:51.809
      Why'd you give this to me?

21:53.245 --> 21:56.013
          (stammering)
           <i>I dunno,</i>
           <i>I guess I, um,</i>

21:56.015 --> 21:57.915
       <i>Feel guilty or something.</i>

21:57.917 --> 21:59.750
             <i>Guilty?</i>

21:59.752 --> 22:01.252
               <i>Yeah.</i>

22:01.254 --> 22:03.254
    Why do you feel guilty?

22:03.256 --> 22:05.222
      You know, everything.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.192
          Cups and all that,

22:09.161 --> 22:10.428
          That's on me.

22:11.530 --> 22:12.663
          That's bullshit.

22:24.943 --> 22:27.211
      It's nothing for you
      to feel guilty about.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.847
  You didn't do anything wrong.

22:31.483 --> 22:33.017
        You understand?

22:33.819 --> 22:35.219
              Yeah.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.625
                Hey,

22:41.627 --> 22:43.127
            I'm serious.

22:44.529 --> 22:47.198
        Cups was a big boy.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.667
      His thing was on him,
      nobody else.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.002
      It's... Yeah, I, um...

22:52.004 --> 22:54.438
  I still feel like I set things
  in motion, though.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.043
              T-t.

23:01.413 --> 23:04.081
    Look, I appreciate what
    you're trying to do.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.717
          Really, I do.

23:07.819 --> 23:09.887
  But this is not your business.

23:14.259 --> 23:16.060
        I love you, marlon.

23:28.707 --> 23:30.374
      So I'm gonna see you?

23:30.376 --> 23:31.909
    See you at aunt ruth's?

23:32.944 --> 23:34.178
          Am I invited?

23:34.679 --> 23:35.946
            Always.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.625
              Fuck.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.562
              I did it.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.931
              -You okay?
              -Yeah.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.433
              Fuck, no.

23:56.868 --> 23:58.335
          I don't know.

23:59.371 --> 24:00.771
    You're doing
    the right thing, talia.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.707
        Easy for you to say.

24:04.709 --> 24:06.644
              Yeah.

24:06.646 --> 24:09.413
      -I know.
      -There was a moment there
      when I thought, like,

24:09.415 --> 24:11.649
    Holy shit, like my heart
    was gonna

24:11.651 --> 24:13.918
      Burst out of my chest,
      and then,

24:13.920 --> 24:15.986
    I don't know, I just...

24:15.988 --> 24:18.489
    Something else just came
    over me, and I just,

24:19.391 --> 24:20.691
      I just fucking did it.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.160
      You did really great.

24:24.429 --> 24:25.629
            You did.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.168
        So what's next?

24:31.170 --> 24:32.670
  We're gonna take it from here,

24:32.672 --> 24:34.238
        Get your brother
        off the streets.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.141
      I call you when it's done.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.477
      (cell phone vibrates)

24:43.281 --> 24:44.348
            Deakins.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.151
                Yes.

24:48.453 --> 24:50.821
  Yeah, thank you for
  getting back to me so quickly.

24:54.759 --> 24:56.560
          Adam hutchings
          bought the camera?

24:57.596 --> 24:58.662
              You sure?

25:00.999 --> 25:03.834
      No, no, that's great,
      thank you so much.

25:09.307 --> 25:10.608
      Everything all right?

25:12.177 --> 25:14.612
          Yeah. Let's, uh...

25:14.614 --> 25:16.213
        Let's get you home.

25:24.122 --> 25:25.656
          You know what?

25:25.658 --> 25:27.024
        Here, hold this.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.268
          (grunts)
          oh, shit, ah.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.772
          Harvard boy, huh?

25:45.043 --> 25:47.044
        I see a harvard boy
        right here.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.048
        -Jesus.
        -One shot, pop.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.150
          Didn't you just
          get out of prison,
          for christ's sake?

25:53.152 --> 25:54.818
        Here, take this.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.525
    George:  <i>So, you got a plan?</i>

26:01.527 --> 26:03.694
        Ethan:  <i>I'd like to get</i>
         <i>a steak and soak up</i>
         <i>some of this booze.</i>

26:03.696 --> 26:05.496
     George:  <i>I mean after that.</i>

26:05.498 --> 26:08.065
  A little sleep would be nice,
  to be honest.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.767
      -Beat up.
      -I'm talking about a plan.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.535
      A real plan for your life.

26:11.537 --> 26:14.605
    Yeah, yeah, I know what
    you meant. I don't have
      an answer, yet, dad.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.674
       <i>Well, I think</i>
     <i>you oughta stay in chicago.</i>

26:16.676 --> 26:19.510
       <i>-Oh, yeah?</i>
       <i>-It's a good town</i>
       <i>for a young guy like you.</i>

26:19.512 --> 26:21.412
          Maybe I will,
          maybe I will.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.348
      This guy, marty stein,

26:24.350 --> 26:26.617
    He's a big shot, right?

26:26.619 --> 26:29.453
    -Yeah.
    -And you guys
    got a connection there?

26:30.555 --> 26:31.956
        What's he like?

26:33.191 --> 26:35.192
  I mean, once you get past the
  brash, arrogant,

26:35.194 --> 26:38.062
    Know-it-all exterior,
    he's a decent guy, I guess.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.863
        Sounds like a dream.

26:39.865 --> 26:42.199
    You two would get along
    like two peas in a pod.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.569
     Well, I'd like to meet him.

26:45.571 --> 26:47.771
        -Yeah?
        -Yeah, why don't you
        introduce us?

26:47.773 --> 26:49.039
          Maybe I will.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.093
              (cackles)

27:09.095 --> 27:10.494
            I wish.

27:10.496 --> 27:12.463
      Come on, let's make it
      like the old days.

27:12.797 --> 27:13.964
              Nice.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.467
        All quiet here.

27:19.504 --> 27:22.973
      Keep your eyes open,
      there might be more than
      one hitter coming through.

27:27.412 --> 27:29.146
      Vengeance is in my heart,

27:29.148 --> 27:31.081
          Death in my hand,

27:31.083 --> 27:34.118
      Blood and revenge
      are hammering in my head.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.586
          (door bell rings)

27:35.588 --> 27:37.655
    God damn it,
    always at the best part.

27:44.362 --> 27:47.297
    Ethan: Betsy, I'm sorry,
    I want you to meet my pop.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.099
        George, this is
        the beautiful betsy.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.101
    Oh, and is she, huh?

27:51.103 --> 27:52.536
            No kisses, dad.

27:56.441 --> 27:58.809
    -No, no, no,
    you need a slap.
    -What's going on out there?

27:58.811 --> 27:59.877
      It's okay, come on in.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.545
    -Where is he?
    -He's right in the den.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.647
            -Marty. Hey.
            -Ethan.

28:03.649 --> 28:05.783
      -Well, this is a pleasant
      surprise, I have to say.
            -Yeah.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.651
    I want you to meet somebody.

28:07.653 --> 28:09.620
            George. Dad.

28:09.622 --> 28:11.188
          Marty's here.
          Here, see?

28:11.190 --> 28:13.123
    -Marty.
    -This is george, my father.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.359
    -Pleasure to meet you, sir.
    -It's nice to meet you, sir.

28:15.361 --> 28:19.063
    -Yeah.
   -Looks like you two have been
    doing a little celebrating.

28:19.065 --> 28:22.466
  Well, a very attractive woman
  slapped my face today, marty.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.134
        Well, I am just
        shocked by that.

28:24.136 --> 28:27.071
          -And it felt good,
          I feel reborn.
          -Yeah?

28:27.073 --> 28:28.839
        Well, I'll leave
        you boys to it.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.140
          -I'm going to bed.
          -You're leaving?

28:30.142 --> 28:31.809
          -That's it, really?
          -Oh, come on.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.110
    Can't have one with me?

28:34.079 --> 28:35.345
            Oh, god damn.

28:35.347 --> 28:36.747
        -Do you mind if I...
        -Good night, betsy.

28:36.749 --> 28:38.248
          No, no, go ahead.

28:41.653 --> 28:44.054
      So you're the great
      marty stein, are you?

28:44.056 --> 28:47.024
        I stand accused.

28:47.026 --> 28:49.693
      I've got a personal favor
      I need from you.

28:49.695 --> 28:51.395
              Okay.

28:51.397 --> 28:54.331
    This is a very good kid,
    but he's troubled.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.066
        So I want you
        to set him straight.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.035
          Okay, you got it?

28:58.037 --> 29:00.504
      Well, he's a handful,
      I wanna tell you.

29:00.506 --> 29:03.841
      -Yeah.
      -But, I promise I will do
      my very best, yes, sir.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.442
              Fantastic.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.211
    Where do you hide the booze
    around here?

29:07.213 --> 29:09.246
      -Here you go.
      -Oh, yeah, thank you.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.914
            -Chin-chin.
            -Chin-chin.

29:12.517 --> 29:14.351
          Cc: Slow down there.
          Talia: Yeah, right.

29:15.687 --> 29:16.920
              Cc: You okay?

29:21.292 --> 29:22.826
          Yeah, I'm just...

29:23.528 --> 29:24.628
              I'm fine.

29:26.197 --> 29:28.098
    What'd you end up doing
    about that thing?

29:30.435 --> 29:32.002
            -So...
            -Um, um...

29:32.737 --> 29:34.304
              Actually,

29:34.306 --> 29:36.707
    Ended up taking your advice,
    is what I did.

29:36.709 --> 29:38.542
              -Yeah?
              -Mmm.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.277
    Fucking this shit right up.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.548
          What's that mean?

29:47.218 --> 29:49.219
    You ever heard of
    thirteenth street kings?

29:49.221 --> 29:50.287
        The a cappella group?

29:51.623 --> 29:52.689
      Yeah, I heard of them.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.726
  Not no more, you didn't.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.167
      This have something to do
      with the feds that came in
      the other week?

30:03.668 --> 30:05.002
              Maybe.

30:05.403 --> 30:07.638
              Talia.

30:07.640 --> 30:12.176
  Did you or did you not tell me
  to cut the bad shit
  outta my life?

30:12.178 --> 30:14.845
  -Yeah, but...
  -It was my brother who hit me.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.347
          My own blood.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.483
            So fuck him,

30:19.485 --> 30:20.851
        Just like you said.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.153
            I said that?

30:25.089 --> 30:27.424
      And now, he's gonna spend
      the next 20 years

30:27.426 --> 30:29.560
    Thinkin' about why
    you don't fuckin' hit me,

30:30.295 --> 30:31.929
                And

30:31.931 --> 30:34.798
  I'm gonna drag that fuck-head

30:34.800 --> 30:37.167
        Marty stein down
        with him, too.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.943
      Sleeping like a baby.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.011
      It's the most peaceful
      he's been all day.

30:49.714 --> 30:51.515
        Cherish the moments.

30:52.984 --> 30:55.519
      You know, I never got to
      have a drink with my dad.

30:56.654 --> 30:58.155
                No?

30:58.157 --> 30:59.857
        No, you're not
        from the south side.

31:01.359 --> 31:03.026
      Never even saw him drunk.

31:03.561 --> 31:05.495
          No, not true.

31:05.497 --> 31:08.298
    I heard him drunk once,
    on the phone.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.467
    July 4th, I was in camp.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.571
          Every 4th of July,

31:15.473 --> 31:17.040
      He would play the trumpet

31:18.643 --> 31:20.811
    With the bucktown
    marching band, you know,

31:20.813 --> 31:23.647
      A bunch of local guys
      get together, buy bowties,

31:23.649 --> 31:25.649
          Dress shorts, and

31:25.651 --> 31:28.485
  -Knee socks, you know, with
  the garters like the old days.
  -Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.254
      And they'd parade down

31:30.256 --> 31:32.890
    Milwaukee avenue,
    neighborhood cook-outs,

31:33.858 --> 31:36.660
    Kielbasa and pirozhkis and

31:36.662 --> 31:39.930
      Beer kegs lined
      both sides of the street,
      you know.

31:39.932 --> 31:42.165
      Lawn chairs and stoops,
      little kids waving around

31:42.167 --> 31:45.869
    With their little flags.
    I loved that parade.

31:45.871 --> 31:49.506
    I used to sit and watch him
    practice that
    goddamn trumpet.

31:49.508 --> 31:50.574
            (vocalizes)

31:50.576 --> 31:53.510
        Just scales and
        marching songs.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.679
        Anyway, that summer
        I went to camp.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.214
          Well, I was sent.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.283
      Actually, troubled spring.

31:59.285 --> 32:02.352
    Middle of the night
    they pull me out of my bunk,
    all right?

32:02.354 --> 32:04.955
      Emergency, run
      to the office, go, go.

32:04.957 --> 32:07.057
          It scared the shit
          out of me.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.960
      I'm running to the office,
      I get there, guy's
      holding up the phone.

32:09.962 --> 32:12.596
  I'm shaking like a leaf,
  I'm thinking the worst, right?

32:13.364 --> 32:15.899
        I hear, "mish!"

32:15.901 --> 32:16.967
         I go, "what?"

32:17.535 --> 32:19.403
          "pop?" "mish!"

32:19.405 --> 32:21.471
          "we made it!
          Mish, we made it."

32:23.875 --> 32:28.045
        -Mish was my
        pop's older brother.
        -Right.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.547
      They made it out of minsk
      together before the war.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.616
      My pop and his sister
      came here.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.652
  Mish migrated to palestine,

32:35.654 --> 32:39.556
    Where he fought
    and was killed in
    the '48 war of independence.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.458
          He thought he was
          talking to mish.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.526
              (chuckles)

32:44.228 --> 32:46.797
    I heard the phone drop,
    you know, clanging
    against the booth.

32:46.799 --> 32:48.598
      His voice trailed off.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.734
        And then, I hear him
        play that trumpet.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.070
            The charge.
            (vocalizes)

32:53.072 --> 32:57.307
      Big cheer from the street
      'cause he's held up
      the parade.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.943
    The other guys picked up
    their instruments,

32:59.945 --> 33:02.579
    Start playing fat freddy
    and the tuba, I hear it.

33:03.581 --> 33:05.015
  Down milwaukee avenue they go.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.051
            He was lit.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.421
      Only time in his life.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.757
      Totally, fucking smashed.

33:13.759 --> 33:16.927
  (scoffs) and you know what,
  I think that was the happiest
  moment in his life.

33:16.929 --> 33:19.596
        Hmm. So you're
        saying that your

33:19.598 --> 33:21.698
    Dad drunk dialed you
   on the 4th of July, isn't it?

33:23.101 --> 33:24.968
        That he did, ethan.
        That he did!

33:24.970 --> 33:26.436
              (inhales)

33:26.438 --> 33:31.641
    -Hmm.
    -That was the last time
    he played that trumpet.

33:31.643 --> 33:37.014
    Well, you know, this is some
    damn good scotch, marty.

33:37.016 --> 33:40.817
      Well, it should be.
      It's been over the barrel
      even longer than you.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.386
              Oh, well.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.154
    I've been finely aged.

33:44.156 --> 33:45.689
              -It shows.
              -Hmm.

33:47.825 --> 33:48.892
            I want this.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.363
      -Help yourself.
      -No, no, I mean the house.

33:54.465 --> 33:55.532
            Scotch.

33:56.134 --> 33:57.200
              All of it.

33:57.735 --> 33:59.136
                Oh.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.504
          I'll tell you what,
          you can have it.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.472
        -But you gotta
        take betsy, too.
        -Hmm.

34:02.474 --> 34:05.542
      -She might like that.
      -No, no, no, no.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.610
          (marty chuckling)

34:10.047 --> 34:13.050
      You know what,
      I think that we should
      work together, marty.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.117
          (smacks lips)

34:16.187 --> 34:17.254
          I'd like that.

34:18.156 --> 34:19.222
              Good.

34:20.024 --> 34:21.725
    Any idea what you wanna do?

34:22.927 --> 34:24.895
    (exhales)
    I don't know, I mean...

34:24.897 --> 34:26.596
      I was thinking about maybe
      I'd go back to law school.
          Maybe I can...

34:26.598 --> 34:28.899
        Ah, fuck that shit.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.068
        Even good lawyers
        are a dime a dozen.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.335
          You are way too
          valuable for that.

34:34.672 --> 34:35.906
    You got any suggestions?

34:38.208 --> 34:40.143
      -I have a few ideas, yeah.
      -Oh, yeah?

34:41.079 --> 34:42.344
      You can start right away.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.784
    (places glass on the table)

34:48.786 --> 34:49.351
        There's something
        I need to do first.

34:53.291 --> 34:54.558
    -Ethan:  <i>I got you. Come on.</i>
    <i>-(george mumbling)</i>

34:54.560 --> 34:57.194
      -Ethan:  <i>Almost there.</i>
      <i>-Whoo.</i>

34:57.196 --> 34:59.362
      I love you, kid, huh?

34:59.364 --> 35:00.931
            -Here, here.
            -(groaning)

35:03.634 --> 35:05.602
        (drowsily) you know
        I love you, huh?

35:07.472 --> 35:09.606
      Oh, god, I'm gonna be
      sick in the morning.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.387
                -Hi.
                -Hi.

35:58.022 --> 35:59.623
        Can I help you?

35:59.625 --> 36:02.792
        Uh, yeah, you don't
        know me, um...
        (smacks lips)

36:02.794 --> 36:04.594
        Is your...
        Is your father here?

36:04.596 --> 36:05.862
          Uh, no, he's out.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.198
                Oh.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.267
        Is there something
        I can help you with?

36:10.269 --> 36:12.202
              Um...

36:12.204 --> 36:14.538
          (sighs)
          no, please, evie.
          Evie, right?

36:15.339 --> 36:16.406
              -Yeah.
              -Yeah.

36:18.943 --> 36:20.010
              Um...

36:20.778 --> 36:22.345
        I knew your mother.

36:24.282 --> 36:25.348
              Okay.

36:26.284 --> 36:28.018
  She was... She was a good cop.

36:29.220 --> 36:30.654
      One of the great ones.

36:30.656 --> 36:33.023
  Umm, I don't know who you are.
  I think you should go.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.224
        Please wait, evie.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.728
      I didn't want anybody
      coming here and...

36:38.730 --> 36:40.630
      And telling you
      that didn't know her.

36:41.799 --> 36:42.866
            Didn't care.

36:46.637 --> 36:47.704
            (sighs)

36:52.143 --> 36:53.443
      Ethan: I think
      you should have this.

36:55.713 --> 36:56.780
              (sobbing)

36:58.983 --> 37:00.984
            (sniffling)

37:00.986 --> 37:03.186
    Evie, the man that did this,
    I got him.

37:03.188 --> 37:05.055
    He's never getting out
    of prison, you hear me?

37:06.023 --> 37:07.090
            (sniffling)

37:09.026 --> 37:10.093
              I'm sorry.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.429
          -(sniffling)
          -I'm so sorry.

37:13.264 --> 37:15.065
        I'm sorry, evie.

37:15.067 --> 37:16.132
            (sniffling)

37:21.672 --> 37:22.806
            I gotta go.

37:52.403 --> 37:53.770
            (unlocking)

38:06.717 --> 38:08.051
          Betsy: Marty?

38:08.053 --> 38:09.452
            Marty: Yeah.

38:09.454 --> 38:10.787
  Betsy: Cc is here to see you.

38:12.757 --> 38:14.291
    Marty: (pages ruffling) cc?

38:14.293 --> 38:16.660
    What are you doing here?

38:16.662 --> 38:20.096
        Cc: I didn't know
        if I should call
        or just come over...

38:20.098 --> 38:21.498
    -Marty: Wanna sit down? Sit.
    -Yeah.

38:23.067 --> 38:24.634
    (both clearing throats)

38:26.337 --> 38:28.838
  -I heard something last night.
  -Okay.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.741
    And I want you to know,
    I appreciate how you
    handled the whole...

38:31.743 --> 38:34.277
  "the stealing from me" thing.
  I got it. What is it?

38:34.279 --> 38:36.913
          Uh, well, I hired
          this waitress.

38:37.615 --> 38:39.582
        -Talia freeman.
        -Yeah.

38:39.584 --> 38:42.752
  And she was drunk last night.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.422
      Mentioned something about
      some sort of, I mean...

38:45.424 --> 38:48.758
    -She was saying that...
    -Just the facts, cc.
    Just give me the facts.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.828
  Her brother's about to
  walk into some sort of
  sting operation with the feds.

38:53.497 --> 38:54.931
              -What?
              -Yeah.

38:56.801 --> 38:59.736
      What exactly did she say?

39:00.971 --> 39:03.173
    She's been cooperating
    with them.

39:03.175 --> 39:05.909
    Umm, they're setting him up,
    gonna arrest him.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.112
  -(marty sighs)
  -I mean, I could give a shit.

39:09.114 --> 39:10.513
      Cc: Sounds like the guy's
      a real asshole.

39:12.450 --> 39:14.117
    But she mentioned your name.

39:14.119 --> 39:15.185
          (marty sniggering)

39:16.620 --> 39:19.456
    And said she was gonna
    drag you down with him.

39:21.225 --> 39:23.526
      I see. Thank you, cc.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.795
              Betsy!

39:25.797 --> 39:27.797
      I mean, she's probably
      just talking shit, right?

39:27.799 --> 39:30.700
    I know, probably. Thank you.
    Betsy will show you out.

39:42.146 --> 39:43.380
              (exhales)

39:43.382 --> 39:45.081
        (cell phone ringing)

39:47.651 --> 39:48.718
        I'm busy, marty.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.081
              (grunting)

40:37.568 --> 40:39.102
        -(phone beeping)
        -(exhales)

40:40.037 --> 40:42.205
        Marlon, god damn it.

40:42.207 --> 40:45.542
      (sighs) call me back
      as soon as you get this.
      Call me back immediately.

40:45.544 --> 40:47.610
          As soon as you
          fucking get this.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.546
      -(ends call)
      -what was that about?

40:49.548 --> 40:52.148
      That fucking bitch, talia.
      I knew it.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.717
      She finally turned on us.

40:54.719 --> 40:56.786
        Feds are setting up
        a sting for marlon!

40:58.289 --> 41:01.424
          He's not answering
          his goddamn phone!

41:01.426 --> 41:05.061
  They probably got him already.
  They probably already
  have him in custody. Fuck!

41:05.063 --> 41:08.565
      No, if he'd been arrested,
      you would've been
      his first call.

41:08.567 --> 41:10.633
    It's Sunday morning, marty.

41:10.635 --> 41:13.903
      Yeah, what a lovely
      Sunday morning it's
      turning out to fucking be.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.004
        He'll be at ruth's.

41:19.009 --> 41:20.577
              Yeah.

41:41.866 --> 41:43.500
        (engine starts)

42:28.145 --> 42:29.412
  Maybe he didn't believe her.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.283
              Shit.

42:41.825 --> 42:44.661
    Got some action.
    Black suv heading north
    from lawson.

42:44.663 --> 42:46.496
   <i>Looks like it's slowing down.</i>

42:46.498 --> 42:48.164
    Can you make out the driver?

42:48.166 --> 42:49.666
  Negative. Windows are tinted.

42:50.167 --> 42:51.267
          Marty: Marlon!

42:53.003 --> 42:54.070
            Open up!

42:55.239 --> 42:57.006
    (marty banging on door)

42:57.008 --> 42:58.575
        Open up, marlon!

43:01.712 --> 43:03.446
          -Where is he?
          -Who?

43:03.448 --> 43:06.015
    I know what you did, you
    stupid little fucking bitch!

43:06.017 --> 43:07.283
      Where the fuck is he?

43:12.556 --> 43:15.692
      Male suspect. Black.
      Entering on the west side
      of the house.

43:15.694 --> 43:17.427
     <i>Looks like he's carrying</i>
     <i>something heavy.</i>

43:26.770 --> 43:28.871
            (door slams)

43:28.873 --> 43:31.441
      -Dea!
      -Harper: Drop your weapon.
      Drop your fucking weapon.

43:31.742 --> 43:32.875
            Drop it.

43:32.877 --> 43:34.510
        -(taser crackles)
        -(gasps)

43:35.379 --> 43:36.613
          (man grunting)

43:39.650 --> 43:40.717
              Jesus.

43:43.053 --> 43:44.120
          (door opening)

43:45.322 --> 43:47.957
    (whistles) motherfucker!

43:47.959 --> 43:49.025
      This your guy, deeks?

43:50.494 --> 43:51.894
    No, but he'll have to do.

43:51.896 --> 43:53.229
      Where the fuck did you
      get this thing, huh?

43:53.231 --> 43:54.464
        Man: Fuck y'all.

43:54.466 --> 43:55.965
    C'mon, let's go, asshole.

43:56.567 --> 43:57.967
            (grunts)

44:14.518 --> 44:16.586
      These days, I see you
      more than my wife.

44:16.588 --> 44:19.088
    Yeah, but I can make you
    happier than she does.

44:19.090 --> 44:20.223
            So you say.

44:26.597 --> 44:27.864
          What is this?

44:27.866 --> 44:31.167
    That's us military grade
    surplus weaponry, man.

44:31.169 --> 44:35.371
      Some has been refurbished,
      most have never left home.

44:35.373 --> 44:38.474
      My supplier can disappear
      a ton, ton and a half
      every three weeks,

44:38.476 --> 44:40.109
    Depending on your needs.

44:40.111 --> 44:42.845
        -How much?
        -It's not for sale.

44:42.847 --> 44:44.514
        So, you are a tease
        just like my wife.

44:44.516 --> 44:46.215
      I'm looking to barter,
      ordonez.

44:46.217 --> 44:47.950
          Guns for product.

44:47.952 --> 44:50.453
          I got no product,
          I got no business.

44:54.525 --> 44:56.559
    I will have to run it
    by the bosses back home.

44:57.494 --> 44:58.561
              Of course.

44:58.962 --> 45:00.963
              But...

45:00.965 --> 45:02.699
        I'm thinking we can
        work something out.

45:03.834 --> 45:04.901
          (marlon chuckles)

45:08.305 --> 45:11.340
      I don't have time
      for this fucking shit.
      Where is he?

45:11.342 --> 45:15.378
  -Don't worry, you gonna have
      a lot of time, real soon.
  -Is he upstairs? Where is he?

45:15.380 --> 45:17.914
      He's fucking family.
      What the fuck is
      wrong with you!

45:17.916 --> 45:20.683
          -The fuck do you
          know about family?
          -Where is he?

45:20.685 --> 45:23.386
    -You're a loner and a leech
    and a fucking crook...
    -Where is he?

45:23.388 --> 45:25.722
  -And you stick your fucking
  nose in everybody's business.
  -Where is he?

45:25.724 --> 45:27.657
      And you destroy
      everything you touch.

45:27.659 --> 45:29.859
    We can still stop this,
    you know that?
    We can stop this right now.

45:29.861 --> 45:32.161
    It's too fucking late. He's
    probably in cuffs right now.

45:32.163 --> 45:34.097
  -And you're about to join him.
  -Where is he? Where is he?

45:34.099 --> 45:35.998
              -Fuck you!
              -Where...

45:39.937 --> 45:41.003
              (exhales)

46:01.592 --> 46:03.092
        (phone ringing)

46:05.963 --> 46:07.964
              Sawchuck?

46:07.966 --> 46:10.900
  -Can you get the paperwork
  rolling on our new guest here?
  -Sure thing, deaks.

46:10.902 --> 46:14.036
    Oh and put out
    an apb on marlon dinard.

46:14.038 --> 46:15.705
      -Conspiracy to murder.
      -On it.

46:16.707 --> 46:17.774
              Let's go.

46:28.919 --> 46:30.887
        Talia, it's deakins.

46:30.889 --> 46:32.955

      pick up your brother now.

46:48.773 --> 46:49.839

46:50.774 --> 46:52.975

46:55.012 --> 46:57.046
          Can you come over?

47:06.323 --> 47:07.657
          (knocking on door)

47:17.801 --> 47:19.268
      Thank you for coming.

47:19.270 --> 47:20.336
              You okay?

47:21.305 --> 47:22.505
    He's totally fucked up.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.007
          -Jack's upstairs?
          -Yeah.

47:33.317 --> 47:34.450

47:34.452 --> 47:35.985
