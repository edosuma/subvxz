00:16.683 --> 00:18.844
Most of y'all have played for me before,

00:18.918 --> 00:24.447
so you know I don't claim to be
some basketball guru.

00:24.524 --> 00:28.221
My playbook is downright simple.

00:28.294 --> 00:32.788
Only five set offensive plays...

00:32.866 --> 00:35.596
five.

00:35.668 --> 00:37.226
Now believe it or not,

00:37.303 --> 00:40.636
we can go all the way
with just those five plays.

00:42.008 --> 00:45.842
We're gonna practice
those plays 1000 times.

00:45.912 --> 00:48.745
We're gonna practice 'em
till they are part of your...

00:48.815 --> 00:50.407
your DNA.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.974
All you boys need are three things.

00:55.021 --> 00:56.852
One, execution.

00:56.923 --> 01:01.951
Two, cohesiveness...

01:02.028 --> 01:06.761
which is just another fancy word
for teamwork.

01:06.833 --> 01:10.291
You must learn to act as one unit

01:10.370 --> 01:12.463
on both ends of the court.

01:14.507 --> 01:16.771
One finger can't pick up a pebble.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.572
But one hand...

01:18.645 --> 01:21.045
Can move the Earth.

01:21.114 --> 01:22.376
...can move the Earth.

01:22.449 --> 01:25.577
Somebody was
listening to me last year.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.347
That's good.

01:27.420 --> 01:31.083
Three, effort.

01:31.157 --> 01:33.318
You must bring it to every practice.

01:33.393 --> 01:36.021
You must bring it to every moment,

01:36.096 --> 01:38.587
to every second of every game.

01:38.665 --> 01:42.101
You leave that out there
on that hard wood,

01:42.168 --> 01:44.295
and win or lose,

01:44.370 --> 01:47.828
you will never have to look
in the mirror and wonder,

01:47.907 --> 01:52.674
"Did I do enough?"

01:55.014 --> 01:57.312
We could have ourselves
a great year, fellas.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.352
A great year.

02:00.420 --> 02:06.154
But it all starts right here
and right now.

02:06.226 --> 02:07.784
Let's get to the baseline!

02:07.861 --> 02:09.794
- Let's go!
- All right, Coach.

02:14.100 --> 02:16.330
Run, fellas. Run.

02:17.403 --> 02:19.564
All right, Christian.

02:24.077 --> 02:27.843
Where you at, Spence?
Where you at?

02:35.522 --> 02:38.457
All right, you know you
can't be on me like that.

02:38.525 --> 02:40.550
You hear me?

02:40.627 --> 02:44.222
What are the two of y'all doing kissing
out in the middle of everybody?

02:44.297 --> 02:46.527
Christian, basketball first this year.

02:46.599 --> 02:49.466
- Girls second, Coach, yeah.
- You got that, Courtney?

02:49.536 --> 02:51.367
Yes, sir.

02:51.437 --> 02:52.529
He knows me?

02:52.605 --> 02:54.573
Of course he knows you, girl.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.472
Yo, come on, I got one.

02:56.543 --> 02:57.805
Ball right here. Mismatch.

02:57.877 --> 02:59.868
Come on, G, shake him up, man.

02:59.946 --> 03:02.414
Come on, shake him up, Gary.

03:02.482 --> 03:04.507
- You got it, Gary!

03:06.186 --> 03:07.983
I hope you're having fun.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.154
Wooo!

03:12.225 --> 03:15.524
The Louisiana High School
Athletic Association

03:15.595 --> 03:17.495
would like to remind all players,

03:17.564 --> 03:19.464
your forms must be filled out completely

03:19.532 --> 03:21.056
before delivering them to station D...

03:24.103 --> 03:27.561
Go on now, Randy. D him up, baby!

03:27.640 --> 03:28.937
"D' him up!

03:29.008 --> 03:32.136
- What up, Christian?
- It's good, JJ.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.509
That's what I'm talking about.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.810
Watch how Spence take
advantage of the white boy.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.885
Offensive foul.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.477
Come on, Spence, you hooked me.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.851
You're fronting.
That was clean.

03:42.922 --> 03:45.220
Take it out, white boy.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.122
Remember the good old days, Sam?

03:47.193 --> 03:50.390
Oh yeah, man. Once you're a Patriot,
you're always a Patriot.

03:50.463 --> 03:52.294
Right, right.

03:52.365 --> 03:54.230
Go on, put me
in the game, Coach.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.564
You get rid of that broom,
I'll get you a ball.

03:56.636 --> 03:59.332
- Don't get me started now.
- There you go.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.373
Ohhh!

04:01.441 --> 04:05.172
- Boy's money, Coach.
- You think?

04:11.217 --> 04:12.844
Poor ass East Bank busters.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.183
Coach, I'm gonna get outta here.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.122
Our boy Brian is a beast.

04:21.194 --> 04:24.721
- How you making out, Collins?
- All right, Simmons.

04:24.797 --> 04:26.856
You looking to win district
again this year?

04:26.933 --> 04:30.494
It's a hard thing to repeat.

04:35.341 --> 04:39.141
You looking to repeat 500?

04:39.212 --> 04:40.338
No.

04:40.413 --> 04:43.007
I'm looking to make a run at your team

04:43.082 --> 04:45.243
for the district champs
this year. What you think?

04:47.954 --> 04:50.013
Everybody got a dream.

04:50.089 --> 04:53.058
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, baby.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.321
That's a weak-ass dunk
you did over there, boy.

04:55.395 --> 04:58.728
You talking about that
silly-ass dunk you did down there?

04:58.798 --> 05:00.698
I'm talking to your bitch-ass,
West Bank bitch.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.394
East Bank ass nigga.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.801
Get back!
Get back.

05:10.843 --> 05:12.674
You all right, son?

05:12.745 --> 05:14.975
I'm cool.

05:15.048 --> 05:18.916
Collins, I'm sorry about that.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.977
Just a little bit too much testosterone.
That's all it is.

05:22.055 --> 05:26.253
Okay?
It's all right.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.123
Come on.
Let's go, guys.

05:28.194 --> 05:29.786
Let's go.

05:29.862 --> 05:33.855
- What's wrong with you?
- Let's go, come on.

05:33.933 --> 05:36.766
Attention,
this is Principal Durant.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.895
The National Hurricane Center
has just announced

05:38.971 --> 05:43.135
tropical storm Katrina is headed
for the Mississippi-Louisiana coast.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.370
Governor Blanco has
declared a state of emergency

05:45.445 --> 05:47.345
and ordered voluntary evacuations...

05:47.413 --> 05:49.404
Patriots!
Spence, get the guys over here.

05:49.482 --> 05:52.417
- Come on.
- Coach, you heard what they just said?

05:52.485 --> 05:54.851
Lt'll turn or get downgraded,
just like it always does.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.616
All right, Coach,
but what about practice?

05:56.689 --> 05:59.089
Listen to the news.
Katrina turns, we're on.

05:59.158 --> 06:00.750
If she doesn't, you go.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.690
The National Weather service is reporting

06:06.766 --> 06:08.597
that tropical storm Katrina

06:08.668 --> 06:10.192
is moving toward the Florida coast

06:10.269 --> 06:13.363
and landfall is also
possible in Mississippi...

06:13.439 --> 06:14.565
Al.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.801
Dayna, I don't think
you need to pack.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.605
We might not have to leave,

06:18.678 --> 06:20.612
but we're gonna be ready just in case.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.477
40 years since Betsy.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.140
It'll turn, like always.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.549
Daddy, I am so glad you're home.

06:26.619 --> 06:29.452
Baby, it's 9:30.
You're supposed to be in bed already.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.319
You can't take all those toys with you.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.622
Even if we have to leave,
you can only take your suitcase.

06:39.732 --> 06:40.892
So, Coach.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.161
Mm-hmm.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.136
How'd the team look this year?

06:45.204 --> 06:47.764
It's the best team I ever had.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.207
We're gonna win this year, Dayna.

06:51.277 --> 06:52.972
We're gonna win.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.809
I got the whole season planned out.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.076
Right here.

06:57.150 --> 07:00.745
You got a plan for everything, Coach.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.378
It's beautiful, ain't it?

07:02.455 --> 07:04.821
When you planning on coming to bed?

07:04.891 --> 07:06.882
Just give me a minute, all right?

07:06.959 --> 07:09.484
Okay.

07:09.562 --> 07:12.122
Don't stay up all night, hear?

07:25.445 --> 07:28.005
- Hey!
- What's up with you, bitch?

07:28.080 --> 07:31.208
Footlocker is open.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.616
I got some special
"get out of town" discounts.

07:33.686 --> 07:36.120
- See, I told you.
- Air Max Elites,

07:36.189 --> 07:39.124
go for like two bills in the store.
50 for you though.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.127
- I like these. These are...
- Yeah.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.095
No, no, I need a 12.

07:44.163 --> 07:45.790
- 12.
- 13.

07:45.865 --> 07:47.765
I'm good with that, Lamont.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.394
- I'm good with 13.
- White boy.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.735
No, I need a 12, Lamont.
You know my size.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.798
This ain't Amazon, boy.
I got inventory issues.

07:56.876 --> 07:59.504
Get outta here, Lamont,
before I call the police.

07:59.579 --> 08:01.206
- Come on.
- I ain't playing.

08:03.282 --> 08:05.512
Just meet me over there
in West Jeff, baby.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.177
West Jeff?
On the East Bank?

08:07.253 --> 08:09.653
- West Jeff.
- No, that's enemy territory.

08:09.722 --> 08:12.247
- Where your loyalty at, Lamont?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.759
Loyalty? Look at my loyalty, baby.
Right here.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.057
I bet against y'all and I win.

08:17.129 --> 08:20.621
Y'all boys couldn't break
500 if you paid the refs.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.134
How you gonna take my drink
like that too, Lamont?

08:23.202 --> 08:25.466
- Give me those shoes.
- What's up, Spence.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.199
- What's up, Spencer?
- What's up?

08:27.273 --> 08:32.107
- Spence, what you still doing here?

08:32.178 --> 08:33.907
The team needs you healthy, son.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.470
You gotta get outta here.

08:35.548 --> 08:38.073
We ain't going nowhere.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.811
Gonna kick that Katrina ass.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.284
What you talking about?

08:44.824 --> 08:48.089
Every person is hereby ordered

08:48.160 --> 08:49.889
to immediately evacuate...

08:49.962 --> 08:53.022
Hey, bro?
Y'all think that Katrina gonna hit us?

08:57.403 --> 08:58.802
Who cares, man?

09:01.140 --> 09:02.505
Let's take a look now

09:02.575 --> 09:04.406
at where Hurricane Katrina
is at this very moment.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.002
Katrina is one day away
and getting stronger by the hour.

09:07.079 --> 09:08.637
The storm is huge.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.114
It's a deadly
category five hurricane.

09:11.183 --> 09:13.811
It's heading towards
New Orleans.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.012
Dayna... Dayna, it's coming.

09:15.087 --> 09:18.022
Dayna, it's cat five.
Come on, get up.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.707
The streets are blocked.
I can't get to you.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.976
Mama, I already told you.
I got everything under control.

09:43.049 --> 09:45.449
If they order you to evacuate,
go to the Superdome.

09:45.518 --> 09:48.578
Mom, it ain't gonna get that bad.
I promise you.

09:48.654 --> 09:50.884
Gary, take care of Kendall, you hear?

09:50.957 --> 09:54.324
He gonna be taking care
of me, ain't that right little brother?

09:54.393 --> 09:55.951
- Yup.
- See? We got it, Mom.

09:56.028 --> 09:57.757
- I love you guys.
- I love you, too.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.991
- Hey, Mama says she loves you.
- I love her, too.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.363
He said he loves you back.

10:14.213 --> 10:15.840
Ma!

10:34.333 --> 10:36.096
Come on, man.
Come on!

10:56.255 --> 10:58.723
Floodwaters have consumed
much of New Orleans.

10:58.791 --> 11:01.760
Tens of thousands of people
still stranded...

11:06.966 --> 11:08.957
I have no idea what they're doing,

11:09.035 --> 11:10.059
but I will tell you this...

11:11.771 --> 11:14.899
God is looking down on all this,

11:14.974 --> 11:16.942
and if they are not doing

11:17.009 --> 11:19.375
everything in their power
to save people,

11:19.445 --> 11:22.608
they are gonna pay the price.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.311
Because every day that we delay,

11:26.385 --> 11:27.852
people are dying.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.548
We're getting reports and calls

11:30.623 --> 11:33.091
that is breaking my heart
from people saying,

11:33.159 --> 11:36.128
"I've been in my attic.
I can't take it anymore.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.095
The water is up to my neck.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.756
I don't think I can hold out."

11:40.833 --> 11:43.267
People are dying.

11:43.335 --> 11:47.863
They don't have homes.
They don't have jobs.

11:47.940 --> 11:51.842
The city of New Orleans
will never be the same.

11:51.911 --> 11:55.608
Excuse my French,
everybody in America...

11:55.681 --> 11:56.773
Daddy?

11:58.851 --> 11:59.840
Hey.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.353
I wanna go home.

12:07.526 --> 12:10.723
Come on.
We're gonna go find your mom.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.898
...biggest goddamn crisis

12:14.967 --> 12:16.730
in the history of this country.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.648
I want my Mommy.

12:32.718 --> 12:34.481
Don't cry.

12:34.553 --> 12:37.386
Don't cry, Alana.

12:38.791 --> 12:41.919
I'm right here, baby.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.195
Please do not push or shove.

12:54.273 --> 12:58.175
- You will be taken...
- Gary, come on, man.

12:58.244 --> 13:02.180
Kendall, hold on.
Mom said she'd be here by now.

13:12.424 --> 13:13.584
Yo, there's Mom.

13:13.659 --> 13:16.127
Kendall, I see Mom.
Excuse me!

13:16.195 --> 13:18.857
- That's my Mom. Wait, wait!
- Kid, we gotta leave.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.728
Mom! Excuse me. Mom!

13:20.800 --> 13:23.928
- Gary!
- Mom, we're right here!

13:24.003 --> 13:27.495
Gary! Gary!

13:27.573 --> 13:30.235
- Don't you worry, Mom.
- Where's Kendall?

13:30.309 --> 13:32.903
He's on the bus.
Come on. He's okay.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.570
- Thank God.
- He's on the bus.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.984
Where we going?
Where they taking us?

13:51.330 --> 13:53.890
Don't know, baby.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.123
JJ.

16:35.194 --> 16:37.594
It's good to see you, son.

16:39.298 --> 16:41.493
You all right?

16:43.602 --> 16:45.968
Season starts in a week.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.097
What time practice tomorrow, Coach?

16:50.109 --> 16:53.636
It's... look around yourself, son.

16:53.712 --> 16:54.736
We're not gonna...

16:54.813 --> 16:57.646
I don't think we're gonna
have a season this year.

16:57.716 --> 17:00.844
So I guess we gonna
practice on the black top

17:00.919 --> 17:02.352
till the gym's fixed, right?

17:02.421 --> 17:04.685
JJ, I don't...

17:04.757 --> 17:07.851
I guess we gonna miss our first game.

17:07.925 --> 17:10.986
But we gonna play
the rest of 'em, right, Coach?

17:11.063 --> 17:13.759
Right, Coach?

17:14.900 --> 17:16.867
Right, Coach?

17:21.740 --> 17:22.934
You all right, son?

17:23.008 --> 17:25.442
Are you all right?

17:27.613 --> 17:31.174
Coach, our house is gone.

17:31.250 --> 17:36.119
My family, we're all crowded
in a FEMA trailer

17:36.188 --> 17:40.591
eating rations every day, Coach.

17:40.659 --> 17:44.095
What time...

17:44.163 --> 17:46.961
is practice tomorrow?

17:54.339 --> 17:56.773
Even if it's just you and me...

17:56.842 --> 17:59.709
to start, I'll be here.

17:59.778 --> 18:02.713
I promise you.

18:02.781 --> 18:05.079
Thank you.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.424
The city's population, which totaled

18:16.495 --> 18:18.759
a little under a half a million before Katrina,

18:18.831 --> 18:20.389
now stands at less than half that.

18:20.466 --> 18:22.764
New Orleans Department
of Water and Power

18:22.835 --> 18:24.496
is reporting 40 present capacity,

18:24.570 --> 18:26.800
and is projecting full capacity
in less than four weeks.

18:26.872 --> 18:29.739
Every day residents continue
to return, and some signs

18:29.808 --> 18:31.332
of rebuilding have begun.

18:35.414 --> 18:38.747
Aha, there's the floor.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.219
Coach... Al.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.778
I didn't get your message.
What are you doing?

18:44.857 --> 18:47.985
I'm putting my team
back together again.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.392
How? With what?

18:50.462 --> 18:53.124
The budget that I have.

18:53.198 --> 18:54.426
That money's gone.

18:54.500 --> 18:59.665
We'll make do with what we have,
won't we?

18:59.738 --> 19:01.433
What about the gym?

19:01.507 --> 19:06.672
We can play all the games away
until this is fixed.

19:06.745 --> 19:10.078
Then we'll do all the practice
on the black top.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.710
Al, this is not where
your energy needs

19:13.785 --> 19:16.618
to be focused right now.
There's a lot going on.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.521
Okay, do whatever you're gonna do,

19:26.598 --> 19:28.463
just don't come to me for money.

19:28.534 --> 19:30.126
I won't.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.102
You just let me coach my team.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.264
Okay.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.639
- Hey, guys.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.904
- Hey, Miss Durant.
- Hey, Coach.

19:39.978 --> 19:43.277
This is Carl.
He played ball over at McDonogh 35.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.111
He got game.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.708
How you doing, sir?
Nice to meet you.

19:46.785 --> 19:48.412
Nice to meet you, too.

19:48.487 --> 19:51.547
- Where everybody else?
- Nobody heard from Christian.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.989
Willy's at Memphis.
Eric's at Lafayette.

19:54.059 --> 19:55.583
He said he not coming back.

19:55.661 --> 19:57.561
Randy said he gonna quit.

19:57.629 --> 20:00.120
He did, huh?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.861
Here's what you do...
you tell Randy to come on by.

20:02.935 --> 20:03.959
I wanna see him.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.697
All right?

20:05.771 --> 20:06.999
You see Spence?

20:07.072 --> 20:09.040
No.

20:09.107 --> 20:11.075
It's all right, son.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.304
Come on, grab a shovel,
help me out.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.437
- There's one over here, one over there.
- All right.

20:15.514 --> 20:16.674
- Okay.
- We'll work this out.

20:16.748 --> 20:18.773
Come on, Sleepy and Dopey.
Shovel up and out.

20:18.850 --> 20:22.616
Up, out.
Up, out.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.734
Spence, where you going, son?

20:37.803 --> 20:38.963
Hey, Coach.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.834
Mr. Walker.

20:40.906 --> 20:44.171
We were gonna give you
a call when we got settled.

20:46.678 --> 20:48.976
We're gonna have a season.

20:49.047 --> 20:52.107
Season? Come on, Coach, y'all
don't even have a gym.

20:52.184 --> 20:55.051
We need you, son.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.520
We've worked really hard
for this moment.

20:57.589 --> 20:58.886
It's my senior year, Coach.

20:58.957 --> 21:00.652
It's got to happen for me now

21:00.726 --> 21:02.159
if I'ma ever get a scholarship.

21:02.227 --> 21:03.990
You can get a scholarship at Ehret.

21:04.062 --> 21:05.962
He's going to Woodlawn, Coach.

21:06.031 --> 21:08.056
Number two in the nation.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.725
That's a program.

21:13.105 --> 21:17.542
Mr. Walker,
uh, the gym is getting fixed.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.134
The teachers are coming back.

21:20.212 --> 21:23.272
We're gonna graduate these seniors.

21:23.348 --> 21:27.307
But we don't have
a team without your son.

21:27.386 --> 21:29.411
We can't stay here, man.

21:29.488 --> 21:30.978
Wake up, Coach.

21:31.056 --> 21:32.523
They don't care about us.

21:32.591 --> 21:35.560
New Orleans is over.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.993
This what you wanna teach your son?

21:39.464 --> 21:42.729
How to run away
when things get tough?

21:42.801 --> 21:44.928
That's not right.

21:45.003 --> 21:46.994
Not right for who, Coach?

21:47.072 --> 21:49.006
You?

22:05.457 --> 22:07.789
When did this happen?
In-state transfers.

22:07.859 --> 22:10.953
- Did they change the rule?
- Yeah, any student is eligible

22:11.029 --> 22:12.121
to play anywhere
statewide immediately.

22:12.197 --> 22:13.994
We lost two of your guys
this morning.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.261
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I assumed you knew.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.769
No.

22:58.510 --> 23:00.740
Christian.

23:00.812 --> 23:02.780
- Hey.
- Coach.

23:02.848 --> 23:05.578
What're you doing over here, man?

23:05.650 --> 23:08.448
Came to see how you're doing,
how your family's holding up.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.215
- You all right?
- Yeah.

23:10.288 --> 23:12.279
- That's good.

23:18.196 --> 23:19.424
We'll get you outta here.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.302
I want to see you 3:30.
Practice tomorrow, all right?

23:25.370 --> 23:28.362
You know, Coach, to be honest,

23:28.440 --> 23:30.305
I gotta look at my options.

23:30.375 --> 23:33.310
We all got choices, Christian.

23:35.313 --> 23:37.304
I'm moving out to California.

23:37.382 --> 23:39.748
Why?

23:42.587 --> 23:44.316
Don't run away.

23:46.391 --> 23:48.052
Don't be afraid, son.

23:49.795 --> 23:51.763
Don't take the easy way out, son.

23:53.365 --> 23:56.027
Don't.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.830
Just believe in yourself.

24:00.739 --> 24:03.071
Where's Coach at?

24:03.141 --> 24:04.768
How much longer we gotta
pick this stuff up?

24:04.843 --> 24:07.778
Quit asking me, all right?
Just worry about this trash.

24:07.846 --> 24:09.677
Carl, you get right there, all right?

24:09.748 --> 24:11.909
Looking good, fellas.
It's looking real good.

24:11.983 --> 24:13.780
- Coach.
- Hey, Randy.

24:13.852 --> 24:16.184
- How you doing? You all right?
- Yes, sir.

24:16.254 --> 24:17.949
- Hey, hey, hey.
- JJ.

24:18.023 --> 24:19.012
- What's up, Coach?
- Hey.

24:19.090 --> 24:23.459
Whoa, whoa, stand back.
You boys are ripe.

24:23.528 --> 24:26.258
Ripe?

24:26.331 --> 24:27.593
Can't wash our clothes, Coach.

24:27.666 --> 24:28.860
There are no laundromats.

24:28.934 --> 24:31.835
- Randy got a washing machine.
- I got one.

24:31.903 --> 24:33.234
- You got a washing machine?
- Yup.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.397
Why didn't you tell me?

24:34.473 --> 24:37.306
All right, you get to wash the uniforms.

24:37.375 --> 24:40.208
Ha ha, wash the uniforms.

24:40.278 --> 24:42.508
I know you didn't
get to play much last year.

24:42.581 --> 24:44.572
I didn't get to spend
much time with you.

24:44.649 --> 24:45.980
That's gonna change this year.

24:46.051 --> 24:48.315
You're gonna go down here.
Just shoot till you miss.

24:48.386 --> 24:50.718
What am I gonna do
after I miss, Coach?

24:50.789 --> 24:53.189
You're gonna shoot till you make it.

24:53.258 --> 24:54.725
Come on.
Come on, son.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.556
Come on.

24:58.396 --> 25:01.331
I want you to show me your shot.

25:01.399 --> 25:03.264
Okay?
Show me what you got.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.827
Haven't had much
chance to work on it

25:06.905 --> 25:09.100
over the summer,
Coach, but...

25:09.174 --> 25:11.972
Whoa!
What's that?

25:12.043 --> 25:14.409
- You forgot how to shoot, son?

25:14.479 --> 25:17.073
I haven't forgotten, Coach.

25:17.148 --> 25:19.013
Okay, we're gonna
go back to fundamentals.

25:19.084 --> 25:21.314
Put your left hand behind your back.

25:22.721 --> 25:25.315
Put the ball on your fingertips.

25:25.390 --> 25:26.687
Oh, not this drill, Coach.

25:26.758 --> 25:28.487
We did this a million times
last season.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.425
Son, you can never get
enough of the fundamentals.

25:30.495 --> 25:32.224
Coach, you're wasting your time.

25:32.297 --> 25:34.322
If white boy could shoot,
he would've been shooting.

25:34.399 --> 25:36.424
- I got it.
- Look at that.

25:36.501 --> 25:37.763
It's ridiculous.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.804
- It's all right, son.
- Keep working, Randy.

25:39.871 --> 25:40.997
It's terrible. Ridiculous.

25:41.072 --> 25:43.336
I'm gonna have to find
a special drill for you.

25:43.408 --> 25:44.966
What kinda drill I'ma do by myself?

25:45.043 --> 25:47.375
If I remember right,
we've gotta work on your footwork.

25:47.445 --> 25:51.347
Hey, Coach!
Hey.

25:51.416 --> 25:53.611
Christian.
You all right?

25:53.685 --> 25:55.118
Yeah, baby,
I'm great, man.

25:55.186 --> 25:57.313
- JJ.
- Yo, my man.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.550
Hey, what's going on?
Christian, man.

25:59.624 --> 26:00.886
- Carl, man.
- All right.

26:00.959 --> 26:03.621
- Where everybody at, yo?
- They'll be coming.

26:03.695 --> 26:06.323
Are you with us, son?

26:06.398 --> 26:09.265
Yeah.

26:09.334 --> 26:11.962
I'm glad to see you.

26:12.037 --> 26:14.335
I need somebody to lead this team.

26:15.907 --> 26:16.896
I'ma make you captain.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.241
- Serious?
- Yeah.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.775
Oh, yeah, this is my boy Dave.

26:27.852 --> 26:29.285
Dave, that's Coach Al.

26:29.354 --> 26:33.484
- What's your last name, son?
- Yeah, about that, Coach...

26:33.558 --> 26:36.755
he don't really speak too much,
but he play that D.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.727
- JJ.
- Carl, man.

26:44.035 --> 26:48.199
I know it's crazy out there,
off this court.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.871
But this blacktop right here...

26:54.879 --> 26:56.779
is your sacred ground.

26:59.184 --> 27:01.982
When you're here...

27:02.053 --> 27:03.418
you're safe.

27:05.123 --> 27:08.422
We're gonna be small,

27:08.493 --> 27:10.120
but we're gonna be tough.

27:11.863 --> 27:14.297
I just need you to dig deep.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.392
Deep.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.905
- I know you boys can do it.
- Yes, sir, Coach.

27:20.972 --> 27:24.032
All right. Let's get to work.

27:24.109 --> 27:27.636
Ready. Stay low.
Short chop step.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.011
This a-way.

27:30.081 --> 27:34.142
We're a little shorthanded.
Five players.

27:34.219 --> 27:37.552
So you'll have to be
twice as good to compete.

27:37.622 --> 27:41.456
That means you'll have
to train twice as hard.

27:41.526 --> 27:44.188
Life is hard,
but we gotta keep livin'

27:44.262 --> 27:46.287
Once upon a time we was chillin'

27:46.364 --> 27:48.264
Now we dodgin' fallin' ceilings

27:48.333 --> 27:49.425
After the storm passed

27:49.501 --> 27:51.469
And I still hear

27:55.573 --> 27:58.167
Hungry with hunger,
feeling delirious

27:58.243 --> 28:00.711
And I wonder if the Congress
is hearing this...

28:00.779 --> 28:03.111
Excuse me.
Can I get one?

28:03.181 --> 28:05.240
We will have pride in our playing.

28:05.316 --> 28:08.479
Our discipline and cohesiveness

28:08.553 --> 28:10.145
will make us competitive.

28:10.221 --> 28:13.384
I'm sorry.
Would two be all right?

28:13.458 --> 28:15.551
I got a team of boys
I'm coaching.

28:17.162 --> 28:18.629
- Dayna: Al?
- Hey, Dayna.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.255
So I saw the house yesterday.

28:20.331 --> 28:24.631
- How is it?
- Needs a little bit of work.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.193
Just a little work?

28:26.271 --> 28:28.637
Oh, come back and get us.
I'm ready to go.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.641
- Come on.
- I'm gonna come back soon.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.233
I'll be back soon.

28:32.310 --> 28:34.175
- All right?
- Okay.

28:34.245 --> 28:35.735
All right.

28:35.814 --> 28:37.873
Begging for change,
and a hope for the future

28:37.949 --> 28:39.109
Soak up the rain

28:39.184 --> 28:40.549
And let the spirits start to move you

28:40.618 --> 28:41.880
Release the pain

28:41.953 --> 28:43.511
And the stress afflicted to you

28:43.588 --> 28:46.523
Never dreamt a hurricane
would do it to us...

28:46.591 --> 28:49.185
Appreciate it.

28:49.260 --> 28:52.024
A vision of a third world
country on first sight

28:52.097 --> 28:55.032
Can't believe my own folks
called us refugees

28:55.100 --> 28:57.625
Trying to write us off
like we ain't worthy to be

28:57.702 --> 28:59.693
The rain comes falling...

28:59.771 --> 29:01.398
Daddy!

29:05.376 --> 29:07.367
Hey.

29:13.451 --> 29:15.351
Al, why didn't you tell me?

29:15.420 --> 29:16.785
I tried to.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.016
Didn't know how.

29:19.090 --> 29:22.423
My baby's room.

29:27.665 --> 29:31.066
Oh, my grandmother's vanity.

29:31.136 --> 29:34.003
Ohh.

29:34.072 --> 29:35.630
Look at this.

29:35.707 --> 29:39.507
Alana, you're not supposed
to be in here.

29:39.577 --> 29:41.340
Al, just let her see it.

29:41.412 --> 29:44.245
- Put this on.
- We can't save nothing.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.217
Don't touch that.
It's got mold on it.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.487
All right?

29:59.531 --> 30:02.091
I used to rock you
to sleep in that chair

30:02.167 --> 30:04.328
when you were a baby.

30:11.609 --> 30:13.406
There's nothing here anymore.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.880
Fix the house.

30:17.949 --> 30:20.008
FEMA'll help us
put it back together again.

30:20.084 --> 30:22.075
- I'm ready to go.
- Where? Where?

30:22.153 --> 30:24.314
- Arkansas?
- They speak English.

30:24.389 --> 30:25.583
It's not a foreign country.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.056
But my players are here, Dayna.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.889
Al, please, forget
about your players for once.

30:29.961 --> 30:31.861
Your family needs you, Al!

30:31.930 --> 30:33.795
Our family's gonna
make it work right here.

30:33.865 --> 30:36.197
We're the glue that holds
this place together.

30:36.267 --> 30:39.100
If people like us leave, then what?

30:39.170 --> 30:41.297
Our daughter was raised here.

30:41.372 --> 30:43.863
Our grandparents, they died here.

30:43.942 --> 30:47.241
If we don't take a stand,
who will?

30:47.312 --> 30:50.770
- I can't. I can't.
- Yes, you can. You can.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.046
I got five boys depending on me.

30:54.118 --> 30:56.780
I gave 'em my word.

31:00.892 --> 31:03.793
The Louisiana Department
of Environmental Quality

31:03.862 --> 31:08.060
said today that initial water samples
from 24 sites...

31:15.940 --> 31:18.170
Where you at, Coach?

31:18.243 --> 31:20.905
Al.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.342
How are you
and your family making out?

31:28.620 --> 31:29.985
House is damaged.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.078
We're working on it.

31:31.155 --> 31:33.487
How about you?
You all right?

31:35.460 --> 31:37.451
No. House is gone.

31:37.528 --> 31:39.758
And my job.

31:39.831 --> 31:42.391
Orleans Parish threw me
and my tenure out

31:42.467 --> 31:44.560
on the street like we're debris.

31:50.775 --> 31:55.109
You know, I could use a little
help over at the school.

31:55.179 --> 31:56.441
I bet you can.

31:56.514 --> 31:58.505
You want me to help you
carry your trash now?

31:58.583 --> 32:00.073
It's not that much money, but...

32:00.151 --> 32:01.880
You just want my players, Collins.

32:01.953 --> 32:03.352
I'm asking about you.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.218
I'm not asking about your players.

32:09.694 --> 32:11.855
I hope things get better for you.

32:23.041 --> 32:27.000
Man, look at this, bro.
It all starts here, yo.

32:27.078 --> 32:28.409
Oh, man.

32:28.479 --> 32:31.937
We got our house back, y'all

32:35.987 --> 32:38.547
These are called "MREs..."

32:38.623 --> 32:40.648
"Meals ready to eat."

32:40.725 --> 32:44.354
This one here is...
mashed potatoes.

32:44.429 --> 32:46.488
With gravy?

32:46.564 --> 32:48.589
It doesn't say anything about gravy.

32:48.666 --> 32:50.861
How you gonna eat mashed potatoes
with no gravy?

32:50.935 --> 32:53.460
You guys put that stuff down,
get ready for practice.

32:53.538 --> 32:56.439
- I got gum up in mine, yo.
- I got gum too.

32:56.507 --> 32:58.805
- All right, fellas, let's go.
- Here we come, Coach.

32:58.876 --> 33:00.707
- Stretch it out.
- Just wanna get my gum.

33:00.778 --> 33:03.508
Don't bounce it.
Pass it, keep it in the air.

33:03.581 --> 33:05.378
Gotta work on gettin' em
in the lane.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.543
- They need to spread themselves...
- Coach.

33:07.618 --> 33:10.553
- I gotta go.
- You'll get your chance in a second.

33:10.621 --> 33:12.521
- No, I gotta go.
- Keep it spread out!

33:12.590 --> 33:16.959
- I gotta go.
- Go, go, go, son.

33:17.028 --> 33:18.461
Ooh.

33:18.529 --> 33:22.056
There you go. That's nice.
That's nice, the way you spaced it out!

33:22.133 --> 33:24.499
That's what I'm talking about.
That was good.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.935
- Look at him.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.606
What's wrong, son?

33:33.678 --> 33:35.669
I gotta go to the bathroom.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.840
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

33:39.484 --> 33:42.009
- Me, too.
- You all right?

33:42.086 --> 33:44.350
I gotta go too, Coach.

34:04.442 --> 34:05.466
All right. Cool.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.010
Let's check on my boys.

34:09.013 --> 34:11.447
Government's supposed to be helping!

34:11.516 --> 34:14.246
Congress has approved
additional financial assistance,

34:14.318 --> 34:16.809
so what we want you to know is

34:16.888 --> 34:18.981
FEMA's making up for lost time.

34:20.358 --> 34:22.724
That's why we're coming to you

34:22.793 --> 34:25.558
in the cities and churches
and libraries

34:25.630 --> 34:26.755
of this battered city.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.891
And in Lafayette, Houston,
Chicago, Dallas,

34:29.967 --> 34:32.731
where the refugees have ended up.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.567
Who you calling a refugee?

34:34.639 --> 34:37.574
Did you just say
what I think you said?

34:37.641 --> 34:40.042
Let's give her
a chance to speak, please.

34:40.110 --> 34:42.170
FEMA representative:
I'd like to ask you if
you have any questions

34:42.246 --> 34:43.338
I could answer right now.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.509
Coach Collins, right?

34:47.585 --> 34:49.052
I'm Brian Randolph.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.348
I know who you are.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.581
Power forward, Kennedy High.

34:52.657 --> 34:54.022
All District, Kennedy High, bro.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.024
You've seen me play?

34:55.092 --> 34:56.321
I've seen you fight.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.923
Oh. Okay, yeah.

35:00.998 --> 35:02.863
Well, your boy was
out there sweating me, so...

35:02.934 --> 35:03.866
No.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.903
You were out of line.

35:08.039 --> 35:10.530
So I guess you didn't come for church.

35:10.608 --> 35:11.802
- No, bro.
- Hey.

35:11.876 --> 35:13.275
It's not bro.

35:13.344 --> 35:14.743
It's Coach.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.544
My coach from summer ball
sent me up here.

35:19.617 --> 35:20.584
Coach Simmons?

35:20.651 --> 35:22.710
Brian Simmons?

35:24.122 --> 35:26.420
Lot of teams want me to come play
for them, now, Coach.

35:26.491 --> 35:28.220
I'm coming to you first.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.419
But if you don't want me,
tomorrow I'm going to go...

35:30.495 --> 35:33.055
You were out of line that day.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.122
And I can't have that on
my team, do you understand?

35:38.269 --> 35:40.430
But we could use you, Brian.

35:40.505 --> 35:42.632
No doubt.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.839
I rode plenty, but I ain't never
really drove a bus before.

35:47.912 --> 35:50.472
Then why'd you volunteer, Sam?

35:50.548 --> 35:51.981
I drive a pick-up truck.

35:52.049 --> 35:54.643
One of them duals with those
big-ass tires in the back.

35:54.719 --> 35:55.777
You know, same thing.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.411
Same exact thing, it's just that...

35:57.488 --> 36:00.355
This is the church's bus.
We can't hurt the church's bus.

36:00.424 --> 36:02.016
Oh, I see it's a church bus.

36:02.093 --> 36:03.993
Got God on the side
of that bus and everything.

36:04.061 --> 36:05.255
You know the good thing
about that is,

36:05.329 --> 36:06.591
we don't got to work on no gas,

36:06.664 --> 36:09.565
'cause this bus is filled
with the holy spirit.

36:09.634 --> 36:11.693
Oh, we're about to be pewn!

36:11.769 --> 36:13.066
You know what pewn is, right?

36:13.137 --> 36:14.126
No.

36:14.205 --> 36:15.399
Pewn!

36:15.473 --> 36:16.531
You mean gone?

36:16.607 --> 36:18.040
I'm gone. Ha, ha!

36:18.109 --> 36:19.337
Get on board, everybody!

36:19.410 --> 36:21.037
Welcome to the NASCAR Bus
series.

36:22.146 --> 36:23.340
Get off my ass!
Get around!

36:23.414 --> 36:25.109
Don't sit behind me.
Go by!

36:25.183 --> 36:28.050
Come on by.
Come on by.

36:28.119 --> 36:29.814
You know what, Coach?
I take that back.

36:29.887 --> 36:31.912
This ain't nothing
like my pick-up truck.

36:31.989 --> 36:33.149
Nothing at all.

36:33.224 --> 36:35.385
Sam? That thing under
your right foot

36:35.459 --> 36:36.756
is called an accelerator.

36:36.827 --> 36:37.816
You know what I call it?

36:37.895 --> 36:40.796
A bunion.
A big-ass bunion.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.924
Sam? Sam, we're gonna be late.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.297
We're in good shape, Coach.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.598
This here bus, like an old woman.

36:46.671 --> 36:48.434
Ever make love to
an old woman, Coach?

36:48.506 --> 36:50.133
No, Sam.
No.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.232
Yeah, well, I have.

36:51.309 --> 36:52.537
I make love to her,

36:52.610 --> 36:54.271
spread her legs up
and turn her around

36:54.345 --> 36:55.972
and start hearing all
those creaks and cracks.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.173
You gotta put that leg down.

36:57.248 --> 36:58.408
You can't hold
that leg up that long.

36:58.482 --> 36:59.813
This bus is an old woman.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.546
I put this bus in the wrong position,
what will happen?

37:02.620 --> 37:04.645
I don't know, Sam.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.053
Something's going to break!

37:06.123 --> 37:07.351
Something's going to break.

37:07.425 --> 37:09.893
Fellas? Fellas, you've got
5 minutes to get ready.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.657
Randy, why don't you get
the uniforms out, all right?

37:15.633 --> 37:18.101
Coach, there was
a slight little problem

37:18.169 --> 37:19.363
with the rinse cycle.

37:21.939 --> 37:24.203
One, two, three! Patriots!

37:24.275 --> 37:25.435
Damn you, white boy.

37:25.509 --> 37:26.840
What, did you not
measure your bleach?

37:26.911 --> 37:28.344
JJ, I messed up.

37:28.412 --> 37:29.936
We look like fools, man.

37:30.014 --> 37:31.106
What the...

37:35.319 --> 37:36.377
Woo! Sexy!

37:36.454 --> 37:37.478
Hey, don't worry about that.

37:37.555 --> 37:38.749
Just play.

37:38.823 --> 37:41.121
Covington High welcomes
the John Ehret patriots

37:41.192 --> 37:43.660
from the West Bank
of New Orleans.

37:43.728 --> 37:45.696
The first game of the season
since the hurricane.

37:48.232 --> 37:49.927
And the Patriots win the tip.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.366
Stick with.

37:52.536 --> 37:56.597
Number 21, David Lewis brings the ball...

37:58.342 --> 38:01.004
Crowd chanting:
Defense! Defense!

38:06.317 --> 38:08.649
Hey! Whoa!

38:08.719 --> 38:09.686
Brian!

38:09.754 --> 38:10.812
Pass the ball!

38:12.256 --> 38:13.450
Hey, come on, Brian.

38:16.627 --> 38:17.651
Woo!

38:17.728 --> 38:19.320
Come on, Brian.

38:19.397 --> 38:22.594
First score by number 23,
Brian Randolph!

38:25.403 --> 38:28.201
Start running offense!
Come on!

38:29.807 --> 38:31.798
Hey, look up!

38:31.876 --> 38:33.366
Ball!

38:33.444 --> 38:34.775
Ball, ball, ball!

38:36.080 --> 38:37.104
Hey!

38:37.181 --> 38:39.775
Come on!

38:39.850 --> 38:42.546
Take the shot.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.085
White boy can't shoot!

38:46.157 --> 38:47.317
It's all right.
It's all right.

38:47.391 --> 38:48.585
Keep your head up.
Let's play.

38:48.659 --> 38:51.287
Get back!
Get back!

38:53.164 --> 38:54.563
Where's the D?

38:54.632 --> 38:56.429
Let's go.

39:01.706 --> 39:03.037
Let's pass.

39:07.044 --> 39:08.102
Yes!

39:09.146 --> 39:10.204
Woo!

39:11.282 --> 39:14.115
Tech.
Technical foul on red 23.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.050
You gonna call
a tech on me, bro?

39:16.120 --> 39:17.246
Brian!

39:17.321 --> 39:18.913
- Technical foul on red 23.
- Get over here.

39:18.989 --> 39:20.115
Two shots.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.557
Why don't you let him play, ref?

39:22.626 --> 39:24.491
Hey, Brian! Brian.

39:24.562 --> 39:27.622
I didn't even do nothing, man!

39:27.698 --> 39:28.995
This is bullshit!

39:29.066 --> 39:31.261
You don't...
Get on the bench.

39:31.335 --> 39:32.427
What?

39:32.503 --> 39:35.028
You heard me.
I told you to sit your ass down!

39:35.106 --> 39:36.596
You sit your ass
on the bench.

39:38.809 --> 39:41.903
Foul on number 23, Brian Randolph.

39:41.979 --> 39:43.674
First technical, third person.

39:45.483 --> 39:46.575
I'm Carl, Coach.

39:46.650 --> 39:49.016
Carl, I want you to go in.

39:50.688 --> 39:53.486
First one's good.

40:00.965 --> 40:02.899
You like the view from here?

40:04.735 --> 40:06.828
You want a water?

40:06.904 --> 40:08.462
Or a Gatorade?

40:08.539 --> 40:10.973
'Cause I want you
to be comfortable.

40:11.041 --> 40:13.305
Need you to get used to sitting here,

40:13.377 --> 40:15.504
because if you don't listen
to what I have to say,

40:15.579 --> 40:18.207
and you don't do
what I tell you to do,

40:18.282 --> 40:20.113
this is the view that
you're going to have

40:20.184 --> 40:21.811
all year long.

40:23.320 --> 40:24.719
Let's go, Chris!

40:32.129 --> 40:34.529
Stolen by JJ.

40:39.370 --> 40:40.428
And the final score,

40:40.504 --> 40:41.372
John Ehret Patriots, 67,

40:41.372 --> 40:42.498
John Ehret Patriots, 67,

40:42.740 --> 40:45.140
Covington Lions, 56.

40:46.210 --> 40:48.474
It's a long year, coach.

40:48.546 --> 40:50.411
Elliot Randolph.

40:50.481 --> 40:52.381
Brian's father.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.976
What can I do for you, Mr. Randolph?

40:56.053 --> 40:57.520
I know a thing or two about the game,

40:57.588 --> 40:59.249
being involved with a great player.

41:00.658 --> 41:02.558
You want to go to district?

41:02.626 --> 41:05.026
Give my boy the ball.

41:08.732 --> 41:10.393
I don't need coaching help.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.130
He can carry this team on his back.

41:15.573 --> 41:17.905
Let's make a deal.

41:17.975 --> 41:23.277
I'll do the coaching,
you watch from the stands.

41:43.033 --> 41:44.466
Coach?

41:44.535 --> 41:45.695
Last man in?

41:45.769 --> 41:46.861
Yeah, Coach.

41:46.937 --> 41:48.029
Yeah.

41:48.105 --> 41:50.801
Nope. No, let's go again.

41:50.875 --> 41:52.433
- But we won!
- Go.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.670
Come on, man!

41:53.744 --> 41:55.541
Let's go!
You're wasted your seconds.

41:56.881 --> 41:58.815
Your mouths get you
into trouble on the court!

41:58.883 --> 42:01.545
Dog it, and you'll be
running for an hour.

42:02.887 --> 42:04.252
Pick.

42:05.289 --> 42:06.381
Pick coming.

42:06.457 --> 42:08.152
That's the only thing I want to hear.

42:10.261 --> 42:11.592
East side!

42:11.662 --> 42:13.721
West side!

42:14.999 --> 42:16.626
East coast!

42:16.700 --> 42:17.826
West coast!

42:17.902 --> 42:19.460
You're a team.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.664
You're supposed to
be helping each other.

42:24.208 --> 42:27.143
You're supposed to be watching
each other's back!

42:27.211 --> 42:29.270
Let's go!

42:29.346 --> 42:30.506
Randy?

42:30.581 --> 42:31.707
Yes, sir, Coach?

42:31.782 --> 42:33.181
What you shooting these days?

42:33.250 --> 42:35.616
Three for 10, Coach.

42:35.686 --> 42:37.517
Three for 10?

42:37.588 --> 42:40.853
Hell, I can hit three for 10.

42:40.925 --> 42:43.553
I need you to hit 10 in a row.

42:43.627 --> 42:45.527
10 in a row?
Coach, I'm not Kobe Bryant, okay?

42:45.596 --> 42:47.587
Well, you better pretend you are Kobe.

42:47.665 --> 42:49.326
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

42:50.968 --> 42:52.833
Son, come on up here.

42:52.903 --> 42:54.962
Somebody give me the ball.
Come on up here, Randy.

42:55.039 --> 42:56.370
What?

42:56.440 --> 42:58.374
Come on.
Top of the key.

42:58.442 --> 42:59.875
Come on.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.679
Randy makes this shot,

43:06.750 --> 43:08.342
this three right here,

43:08.419 --> 43:10.387
y'all don't have to run no more.

43:10.454 --> 43:11.853
Here you go.

43:12.990 --> 43:14.184
Coach, this doesn't
make any sense.

43:14.258 --> 43:15.350
Why are you doing this to me?

43:16.393 --> 43:18.452
You can do this.

43:18.529 --> 43:19.928
Take the shot.

43:19.997 --> 43:22.158
Coach, let me shoot it, man.

43:22.232 --> 43:24.462
- I'm tired as hell, too, Coach.
- Let me shoot it!

43:24.535 --> 43:26.002
He can't make that shot.

43:26.070 --> 43:27.059
You boys need to
support your teammate.

43:27.137 --> 43:28.229
What, do you want to distract him?

43:28.305 --> 43:29.329
Do you want him to make the shot?

43:29.406 --> 43:32.773
Let me shoot it.
Let me shoot it, Coach.

43:32.843 --> 43:34.242
He can't make that.

43:34.311 --> 43:35.835
Let me shoot it.

43:39.149 --> 43:41.140
Nice shot.

43:41.218 --> 43:42.207
Come here, baby.

43:42.286 --> 43:43.344
I knew he could do it, Coach!

43:43.420 --> 43:44.444
Practice over.

43:44.521 --> 43:47.513
I might get some respect.

43:49.193 --> 43:51.320
Hey, bro, stop writing on the lockers, man.

43:51.395 --> 43:53.329
This ain't the east.
We respect our house, here.

43:53.397 --> 43:55.490
Hey, hey.
My bad, bro.

43:55.566 --> 43:56.828
You got it, Captain.

43:56.900 --> 43:59.698
Oh, shoot, before I forget.

43:59.770 --> 44:02.603
I think I got a little something
that might belong to you.

44:02.673 --> 44:04.106
Huh?

44:06.910 --> 44:08.138
Give you girlfriend her number back.

44:08.212 --> 44:09.509
I ain't gonna call her.
I promise.

44:09.580 --> 44:10.512
I ain't gonna do it.

44:10.581 --> 44:12.481
I ain't gonna do it, bro.

44:14.051 --> 44:15.348
She fine, though.

44:15.419 --> 44:17.853
I ain't that type of brother.

44:17.921 --> 44:20.048
You should have gave the number to me.
I would've called her.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.594
Your boy's a little soft, coach.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.357
I'm telling you.

44:26.430 --> 44:29.160
You're in no position to evaluate anyone,

44:29.233 --> 44:31.224
'cause you couldn't guard a statue.

44:31.301 --> 44:32.996
Aw.

44:33.070 --> 44:35.265
Yeah, I'm gonna get with the D,
you know.

44:35.339 --> 44:36.863
Eventually.

44:37.975 --> 44:40.535
You're a ball hog, Brian.

44:40.611 --> 44:41.942
- A ball hog?
- Yeah.

44:42.012 --> 44:44.276
But let me tell you like this.

44:44.348 --> 44:47.044
You give me the rock 70% of the time,
you're going to win.

44:47.117 --> 44:49.449
Easy.

44:49.520 --> 44:50.953
No question.

44:51.021 --> 44:52.989
That may be.

44:53.057 --> 44:54.024
Yeah.

44:55.659 --> 44:57.126
But I'm gonna run the offense
through Christian.

44:57.194 --> 44:58.354
Christian?

44:58.429 --> 44:59.555
Yeah.

44:59.630 --> 45:01.621
How about showing
me some love, huh, Coach?

45:01.699 --> 45:04.167
I'm the only D-1 player you've got
on this whole team,

45:04.234 --> 45:05.997
and you're going to run
the offense through Christian?

45:06.070 --> 45:08.265
Just 'cause you're
a good player, son,

45:08.338 --> 45:10.829
doesn't mean you get to do
whatever you want to do.

45:13.444 --> 45:15.071
You sure about that, coach?

45:15.145 --> 45:16.908
Oh, I'm positive.

45:20.084 --> 45:22.882
The recent upsurge in violence
in post-Katrina New Orleans

45:22.953 --> 45:26.116
has been attributed to the closing
of over 225 schools.

45:26.190 --> 45:28.090
One surviving school,
John Ehret,

45:28.158 --> 45:30.023
whose basketball team
has been cobbled together

45:30.094 --> 45:31.823
with players from all
over New Orleans

45:31.895 --> 45:34.022
eked out a victory in their
first game of the season.

45:34.098 --> 45:36.532
This is surprising, after
losing their star player,

45:36.600 --> 45:39.296
Spencer Walker, to top-ranked
Woodlawn early...

45:59.123 --> 46:00.283
How you making out, Coach?

46:02.392 --> 46:03.689
All right.

46:05.195 --> 46:06.753
I wanted to...

46:06.830 --> 46:10.459
to thank you
for sending Brian my way.

46:10.534 --> 46:11.831
I tried to call you,

46:11.902 --> 46:14.564
but the number you gave me
was disconnected.

46:14.638 --> 46:17.334
Yeah, well,
you know how it is.

46:18.942 --> 46:20.876
I saw your opener.

46:20.944 --> 46:23.504
I'm still surprised at that
with only six players.

46:23.580 --> 46:25.309
Yeah, I don't know, Coach.

46:25.382 --> 46:29.113
If they'd have played some real defense,
probably beat us.

46:29.186 --> 46:32.678
Coach,
with your personnel,

46:32.756 --> 46:35.725
just be glad you got any wins.

46:37.795 --> 46:40.389
You're playing Bourgeois next, right?

46:40.464 --> 46:41.488
Yeah.

46:44.835 --> 46:45.824
Thank you.

46:45.903 --> 46:47.302
Hell.

46:47.371 --> 46:49.498
I beat 'em like they
stole something from me.

46:49.573 --> 46:51.131
All you gotta do is
utilize your speed on them,

46:51.208 --> 46:52.698
and they...

46:56.713 --> 47:01.446
You know, I could still
use some help around here.

47:01.518 --> 47:05.318
And like I said, I'll do
what I can to get you paid.

47:05.389 --> 47:08.654
I don't give a damn
about the money.

47:08.725 --> 47:10.920
So then I'll see you tomorrow.

47:10.994 --> 47:14.157
How about 3:00?

47:14.231 --> 47:16.096
Sure.

47:19.136 --> 47:20.262
Whoa!

47:20.337 --> 47:21.736
Take it.

47:21.805 --> 47:22.965
What's that?

47:23.040 --> 47:24.837
David, were you calling for a pick?

47:26.276 --> 47:28.540
Were you asking for help?

47:30.247 --> 47:31.475
Go on.

47:31.548 --> 47:32.480
Go on, go sit down.

47:32.549 --> 47:34.176
Go sit down.

47:34.251 --> 47:36.651
Don't come back on this court
until you're ready to play.

47:36.720 --> 47:38.017
Hey, come on, now, Coach.

47:38.088 --> 47:39.680
Don't you think you're being
a little bit hard on him?

47:39.756 --> 47:40.882
I mean, he is trying.

47:40.958 --> 47:41.982
I need effort on this court.

47:42.059 --> 47:43.048
You ready to play?

47:43.126 --> 47:44.286
I'm ready, Coach.

47:44.361 --> 47:45.521
All right, get in, JJ.

47:45.596 --> 47:46.858
Carl, you get over there on Brian.

47:46.930 --> 47:48.522
JJ, you get over there with Christian.

47:51.235 --> 47:52.395
Let's do it.

47:53.904 --> 47:55.701
Fellas, I need you to talk to each other.

47:55.772 --> 47:57.069
All right, JJ?
Let's do it.

47:58.141 --> 47:59.073
- Boy?
- Coach!

47:59.142 --> 48:00.734
David!

48:00.811 --> 48:02.711
Coach, my initial examination indicates

48:02.779 --> 48:05.714
that David is extremely malnourished.

48:05.782 --> 48:07.374
What's going...

48:07.451 --> 48:12.445
We lost our Mama in Katrina,
and it's been hard.

48:12.522 --> 48:14.114
And now it's just the two of us.

48:14.191 --> 48:16.682
David ain't opened
his mouth since then.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.364
I'm sorry.

48:26.336 --> 48:28.270
Could you go check on
the rest of the boys?

48:28.338 --> 48:30.135
Nurse:
Sure thing, coach.

48:32.276 --> 48:33.937
Go with him.

48:35.012 --> 48:36.741
David, it's going to be okay.

48:36.813 --> 48:37.905
Drink some more water.

48:41.551 --> 48:43.678
So, I found a job.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.585
Patient rep down at Memorial.

48:45.656 --> 48:47.055
I start on Monday.

48:47.124 --> 48:48.113
Great.

48:48.191 --> 48:50.284
That's great.

48:50.360 --> 48:53.420
Al, after school,
Alana's gonna be your responsibility.

48:54.898 --> 48:55.830
What are you talking about, Dayna?

48:55.899 --> 48:57.161
You know I got practice.

48:57.234 --> 49:00.203
They won't let me keep her
at the hospital, Al.

49:00.270 --> 49:03.000
Doesn't Ellis have an
after-school program?

49:03.073 --> 49:04.665
Not since Katrina.

49:06.343 --> 49:08.971
How am I supposed to coach
and baby-sit at the same time?

49:09.046 --> 49:09.978
You're not a babysitter!

49:10.047 --> 49:13.073
You're a father.

49:13.150 --> 49:14.879
Right.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.613
Maybe not.

49:16.687 --> 49:18.621
But those boys have been
through so much already...

49:18.689 --> 49:20.384
And so have we, Coach.

49:27.798 --> 49:29.925
Simmons:
So look here, so I got two players

49:30.000 --> 49:31.524
I think you should take a look at.

49:31.601 --> 49:33.466
First one's name is Nick Washington.

49:33.537 --> 49:35.334
All District, Hardin High.

49:35.405 --> 49:37.305
Yeah, he just came back.

49:37.374 --> 49:40.002
I'm gonna go check him out
at Hardin Park after practice.

49:40.077 --> 49:41.669
I don't know.
Another East Bank kid?

49:41.745 --> 49:45.237
I'm gonna have to go with you on that.

49:45.315 --> 49:47.647
You don't trust me
scouting on my own?

49:47.718 --> 49:49.151
I didn't say that.

49:49.219 --> 49:51.312
You didn't have to.

49:58.161 --> 49:59.822
Ah!

50:01.465 --> 50:03.365
That's what's up, Nick!
Yeah, baby!

50:03.433 --> 50:05.162
Daddy, in my opinion,

50:05.235 --> 50:06.793
I think you should sign him up.

50:08.905 --> 50:10.270
Gotta agree with you on that.

50:10.340 --> 50:12.433
Simmons:
The other player
you should take a look at

50:12.509 --> 50:15.069
is a point guard by the name
of Gary Davis.

50:15.145 --> 50:16.169
You should talk to him.
See what you think.

50:16.246 --> 50:17.679
Coach, uh...

50:17.748 --> 50:19.875
you know I don't play ball
or nothing like that no more.

50:19.950 --> 50:21.679
Who said anything
about playing ball, son?

50:23.720 --> 50:24.880
Coach Simmons.

50:24.955 --> 50:26.320
I mean, he spoke to me...

50:26.390 --> 50:28.551
I don't even think that
you could make the team, son.

50:29.793 --> 50:31.693
Huh?

50:31.762 --> 50:34.822
Coach, if I wanted to make your team,

50:34.898 --> 50:36.798
I could make your team, Coach.

50:36.867 --> 50:38.835
That's not a problem.

50:38.902 --> 50:41.029
I don't know.
I've seen you play.

50:41.104 --> 50:43.038
You got good D.

50:43.106 --> 50:44.198
Yeah.

50:44.274 --> 50:45.935
But you're very one-dimensional, son.

50:46.009 --> 50:47.567
One-dimensional?

50:47.644 --> 50:48.611
Yeah.

50:51.481 --> 50:53.108
Coach, I'm the fastest player
in the whole of the East Parish.

50:56.887 --> 50:59.788
You know what?
You know what?

50:59.856 --> 51:03.155
It's good to see you so confident.

51:03.226 --> 51:04.693
Anyway, doesn't matter.

51:04.761 --> 51:06.194
Have a nice day, son.

51:12.803 --> 51:14.168
Announcer:
And here come the Patriots.

51:14.237 --> 51:17.035
Crowd chanting:
Defense! Defense!

51:17.107 --> 51:18.574
And that's another score
for the newest member

51:18.642 --> 51:21.133
of the Patriots, Gary Davis.

51:21.211 --> 51:22.143
Time, time!

51:23.246 --> 51:24.440
Good time.
Good time out.

51:24.514 --> 51:26.414
20-second time out by the Patriots.

51:26.483 --> 51:30.852
Gary Davis has been a real spark plug
on both ends of the floor.

51:30.921 --> 51:31.888
Good effort.
Good effort.

51:31.955 --> 51:33.718
- Good play, Gary.
- Appreciate it, Coach.

51:33.790 --> 51:35.052
All right, here we go, fellas.

51:35.125 --> 51:37.025
We got 11 seconds left,
we're gonna run pairs.

51:37.094 --> 51:39.187
Gary, I want you to take
the inbound from Brian.

51:39.262 --> 51:41.560
Just drive really hard
down towards the middle.

51:41.631 --> 51:42.598
- Okay?
- Got it.

51:42.666 --> 51:44.691
Brian, give me a
hard pick for Christian.

51:44.768 --> 51:46.759
Christian, it's your ball.
You take the shot.

51:46.837 --> 51:48.168
All right, fellas.
That's the play.

51:48.238 --> 51:50.001
- Let's run it.

51:51.808 --> 51:53.332
I'm looking at the score.
We're all right.

51:53.410 --> 51:55.037
We got this in the bag.

51:58.715 --> 52:01.377
What you looking at?

52:01.451 --> 52:03.180
How much you wanna bet
they don't score?

52:03.253 --> 52:06.450
Aren't you in the wrong
rooting section?

52:06.523 --> 52:08.514
This is what I'm rooting
for, little mama.

52:08.592 --> 52:10.253
Mind your business.

52:10.327 --> 52:11.954
Who is that?

52:12.028 --> 52:14.155
Get over here, all y'all.

52:16.199 --> 52:17.860
Woo!
C'mon, baby!

52:17.934 --> 52:19.367
Let's do it!

52:20.604 --> 52:22.094
Let's go, Brian!

52:22.172 --> 52:23.434
Let's run the offense.
Come on!

52:25.242 --> 52:27.233
Crowd:
Defense!

52:27.310 --> 52:29.471
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

52:29.546 --> 52:31.605
Brian, take it to the hoop, son.

52:31.681 --> 52:33.171
Hey, Brian.
Pass the ball.

52:37.120 --> 52:39.281
Oh! Charge against number 23.

52:39.356 --> 52:40.448
Hahnville?

52:40.524 --> 52:42.219
How'd we lose to
Hahnville, brothers?

52:42.292 --> 52:43.350
How did we lose, man?

52:43.426 --> 52:44.825
Tell Captain pork-ass
to give me the ball.

52:44.895 --> 52:46.453
Hey, man, you need
to watch you mouth.

52:46.530 --> 52:48.293
Whoa, whoa.
What's going on here?

52:48.365 --> 52:50.230
Hey!

52:50.300 --> 52:51.767
Sit down.

52:54.304 --> 52:56.397
What do I need to say
to you all to get you

52:56.473 --> 52:57.838
to turn this thing around?

52:57.908 --> 52:59.432
What you need to do is stop
giving your ball

52:59.509 --> 53:01.704
to your stupid-ass pet
and give me the ball, Coach.

53:01.778 --> 53:03.006
That's what you need to do.

53:03.079 --> 53:04.137
- You want the ball?
- Hell, yeah, I want the ball.

53:04.214 --> 53:05.272
- You want the ball?
- Hell, yeah.

53:05.348 --> 53:07.213
Let me give you the ball.
Take the ball!

53:09.019 --> 53:10.452
Get out of my gym!

53:10.520 --> 53:12.715
You get out.
You take your stuff out that locker,

53:12.789 --> 53:15.656
you get your bag,
you get your bling-bling,

53:15.725 --> 53:16.851
you take you earrings.

53:16.927 --> 53:18.258
Get on out!

53:18.328 --> 53:21.627
You want to play by yourself?
Go be by yourself.

53:21.698 --> 53:23.859
Get out.

53:23.934 --> 53:26.835
You's a bitch.

53:30.106 --> 53:31.403
Al.

53:37.347 --> 53:39.281
Come on.

53:42.319 --> 53:44.219
Nobody move.

53:45.322 --> 53:46.289
You hear me?

53:53.029 --> 53:55.361
- Coach?
- Yeah?

53:55.432 --> 53:58.424
We can't afford to kick
Brian off this team.

54:01.438 --> 54:02.769
You heard what he said.

54:02.839 --> 54:04.306
You've dealt with difficult
players before.

54:04.374 --> 54:05.466
Hell, I know you have.

54:05.542 --> 54:06.566
The boy ain't got nowhere to go.

54:06.643 --> 54:08.167
I got to think about these other kids.

54:08.245 --> 54:09.405
There's other boys in there.

54:09.479 --> 54:10.639
Everybody's got problems.

54:14.117 --> 54:15.379
Phew, boy.

54:15.452 --> 54:16.578
You're about as bad as Brian.

54:16.653 --> 54:19.679
All right,
what's that supposed to mean?

54:21.024 --> 54:22.582
You hear that?

54:24.594 --> 54:27.586
You're hot-headed, hard-headed,

54:27.664 --> 54:30.428
stubborn, and you don't
wanna listen, just like him.

54:30.500 --> 54:32.525
You need to stop making excuses

54:32.602 --> 54:33.660
for that boy.

54:33.737 --> 54:35.398
Go. Crush him.

54:35.472 --> 54:36.871
What's wrong?

54:36.940 --> 54:38.669
Ruin him.
You can do that.

54:40.577 --> 54:42.511
Go on, take the one good thing
in his life away from him.

54:42.579 --> 54:43.705
Go ahead and
take that from him.

54:46.149 --> 54:47.548
But you came to me

54:47.617 --> 54:51.417
and told me that you
want to coach your team.

54:51.488 --> 54:53.183
Not somebody else's.

54:53.256 --> 54:54.348
Yep.

54:54.424 --> 54:55.914
Well, guess what?

54:55.992 --> 54:58.256
You got somebody else's team.

54:58.328 --> 55:00.558
You got New Orleans' team.

55:00.630 --> 55:01.597
Whoa.

55:01.665 --> 55:04.429
You got me, uptown, downtown,

55:04.501 --> 55:07.026
East Bank and West Bank all in here.

55:07.103 --> 55:11.733
I get what you're doing, Al.

55:11.808 --> 55:14.299
Bigger than the game.
I got that.

55:14.377 --> 55:17.710
I'm just asking you
to bend a little, that's all.

55:20.150 --> 55:23.176
Just...

55:23.253 --> 55:25.653
just listen a little.

55:39.736 --> 55:40.964
Lil' ticket?

55:42.105 --> 55:43.538
Lil' ticket.
Come on.

55:43.606 --> 55:45.403
Bring it here.
Come here.

55:47.243 --> 55:48.301
Look here.

55:48.378 --> 55:51.074
I've talked to Coach,

55:51.147 --> 55:57.086
and the problem is, he don't know your
greatness like I do.

55:57.153 --> 56:01.089
So all you gotta do is show your skills

56:01.157 --> 56:05.116
to the Coach and the rest
of these other players.

56:07.530 --> 56:09.293
Full court.

56:09.366 --> 56:10.799
Yeah, Brian.

56:10.867 --> 56:13.233
Consider yourself unleashed.

56:13.303 --> 56:14.463
Hoo!

56:14.537 --> 56:17.563
Boy, you know you
a beast when you unleashed.

56:17.640 --> 56:18.937
Christian, Christian.

56:19.008 --> 56:20.635
Come on, you stop him.
All right?

56:20.710 --> 56:22.007
It's on now, boy.

56:25.882 --> 56:26.940
Come on, boy.

56:27.016 --> 56:28.813
Check it up.

56:28.885 --> 56:30.477
Hold on, Coach.
I don't know if this is too fair.

56:30.553 --> 56:31.747
It looks like Lil' Ticket

56:31.821 --> 56:33.345
got, what, two, three, four
pounds on Christian.

56:33.423 --> 56:34.355
You right.
You right.

56:34.424 --> 56:36.790
David, come on in.

56:36.860 --> 56:38.555
Come on here.
Let's make this fair.

56:41.297 --> 56:42.286
What, you're talking about,
like, two on one, now?

56:42.365 --> 56:44.333
What, you scared, Brian?

56:46.169 --> 56:47.158
Please.

56:47.237 --> 56:49.330
I'm gonna dunk on
your ass so hard, boy,

56:49.406 --> 56:50.805
it's gonna make you talk.

56:50.874 --> 56:52.102
I'm sure you will.

56:52.175 --> 56:53.972
Woo! I'm sure you will.

56:54.043 --> 56:55.704
Full court.

56:55.779 --> 56:57.269
Gary, you're in.

56:58.448 --> 57:00.712
Nick, you're in.

57:00.784 --> 57:03.810
Carl, come on in as well.

57:03.887 --> 57:05.582
Go ahead, son. You can do it.

57:05.655 --> 57:07.418
You can play all of them.
You don't need a team.

57:07.490 --> 57:09.890
Go on, Lil' Ticket.
This is easy work for you.

57:09.959 --> 57:12.257
Come on.
Put the ball in the hole.

57:12.328 --> 57:14.353
Where your mouth at
now, Lil' Ticket?

57:17.600 --> 57:19.261
Let's go, Lil' Ticket.

57:19.335 --> 57:21.064
Full court.

57:26.276 --> 57:27.868
Got something to say?
What's up, boy?

57:27.944 --> 57:30.378
Huh?

57:30.447 --> 57:32.608
C'mon, boy! Defend you man!

57:33.683 --> 57:34.809
Let's go.

57:34.884 --> 57:36.476
Aw, come on, man.
Put the ball in the hoop.

57:36.553 --> 57:37.542
Put the ball in the hoop.

57:39.789 --> 57:41.416
There it is.

57:43.259 --> 57:45.056
What's up, punk?

57:45.128 --> 57:46.322
Defense, Lil' Ticket!

57:46.396 --> 57:47.488
Oh!

57:50.733 --> 57:53.065
That's two-zip.
You're making me look bad.

57:53.136 --> 57:55.434
Come on and take
the ball out, son.

57:55.505 --> 57:57.029
You're by yourself, now.

58:24.634 --> 58:25.931
This is easy work for you.

58:29.272 --> 58:30.603
Talk to me.

58:41.251 --> 58:43.651
I got it, man.

58:43.720 --> 58:46.245
What did you say?
I didn't hear you.

58:48.324 --> 58:51.384
I said, I got it.

59:14.918 --> 59:15.976
Run!

59:16.052 --> 59:17.644
Your ass better run!

59:20.557 --> 59:22.855
No more!

59:22.926 --> 59:24.894
Brian?

59:24.961 --> 59:26.758
You all right, son?

59:26.829 --> 59:29.389
Damn baseheads.

59:29.465 --> 59:31.626
Trying to steal the copper pipes
and sell them for scrap.

59:31.701 --> 59:32.963
What are you doing out here?

59:33.036 --> 59:35.732
Came by to see if I could
sit with you for a while.

59:39.442 --> 59:40.841
Come on.

59:57.093 --> 59:58.560
Thank you.

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:13.739
Came to see how you're
holding up after today.

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.209
You all right?

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.542
I'm straight.

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:24.853
Okay, Coach, look,

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:27.082
I'm sorry, okay?

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:31.786
I know I shouldn't have
opened my mouth like that,

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:34.955
but I'm frustrated, Coach.

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:37.397
For real, I'm... this is...

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.128
We've got a little bit
of a season left.

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:41.397
Maybe I'm going to be making
a few adjustments

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:42.904
to the personnel.

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:45.998
But you've got to remember one thing,

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:48.475
you got to fit into the team.

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:50.978
The team is not going to fit into you.

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.945
Only a fool doesn't change, Brian.

01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:00.852
I am at a total loss.

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:06.190
What is it that you boys
need me to say to you?

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:08.127
You're 9-11.

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:11.826
One more loss,
and you don't make it to the playoffs.

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:13.630
You want to play?

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:15.364
Randy.

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:17.133
You want to play?

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:23.334
Son, don't you feel
you deserve to play?

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:25.711
Ain't nothing else
for me to say to you.

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:28.478
You've got to make
the decision to be a team.

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:30.519
So before you go out
onto that court,

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:33.214
you gotta work this out
amongst yourselves.

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:35.223
Tell me what you're gonna do.

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:44.559
All right, y'all.

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:47.000
How are we gonna do this?

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:51.439
Maybe each player should just
say what he needs to do better.

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:54.965
Then we could say what the other players
need to do, too, right?

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:57.308
Ah, man, right now
we're trying to focus as a team.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.575
A team? What kinds of captain
is you anyway, bro?

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:00.946
You ain't passed the ball to me

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:02.746
but about three times
this whole season.

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:04.946
That's because you never
pass the ball back, Brian.

01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:07.785
You ain't nothing but
a selfish bastard, man,

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:09.085
and I don't like playing with you.

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:10.955
You know what, Chris?
You damn right.

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:12.824
You is a selfish little bastard.

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.123
Is that right?

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:15.494
What are you mouthing off for, man?

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.624
It's our team, first.
You all know that, bro.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.224
- We don't belong?
- Take your hands off me.

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:20.496
We don't belong here, bro?

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.470
- Y'all don't want us here?
- No. Bye.

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:24.165
You don't want us here?
Speak up.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.832
Bye.

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:27.466
You don't want us here, bro?

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.303
Cool.

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:32.006
Yo, Christian,
you got to do something.

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:34.276
Let's roll, bro.
Let's roll.

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:45.988
So that's how it is, huh?

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:47.461
Cool.

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:48.963
- I'm out.
- Wait, wait, B-man.

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.521
- Don't walk out on your team, man.
- What team?

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.033
Hey, Gary, just let him go.

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:54.262
What kind of captain are you,
Christian?

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:55.429
Huh?

01:02:57.306 --> 01:02:58.273
Yo, B.

01:02:58.341 --> 01:02:59.603
Yo, B, stop, man.

01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:00.801
- What, man?
- Just for a second, all right?

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:04.913
When I moved back to Houston,

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:07.609
25 of them jumped on me
and my little brother.

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:10.777
Damn near killed us both.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:13.378
Do you think they care about what side
of the river I came from?

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:18.323
Let's go back in here.

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:20.294
Let's handle this like men.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:23.655
Come on, B.

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:31.366
This ain't gonna work, bro.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.805
'Cause of him right there.

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:38.607
Wow, look at the man in the mirror.

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:39.807
You know what?
I swear to God,

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.372
if this clown says
one more thing to me...

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:44.643
Squash all that!

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.278
Look, B, man, I know
we can work this out.

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:47.686
You don't know nothing.

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:49.816
You ain't been on this team
but about a minute, bro.

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:51.086
What?

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.650
You heard what I said.

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:54.628
I've been here long enough
to hear it all about you.

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:56.995
Brian don't play D.
Brian the ball hog.

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:58.658
Brian don't pass the ball.

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:00.565
Brian don't care about anything.

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:02.763
- Even winning.
- That's some bullshit.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:05.034
- Yeah?
- That's some bullshit!

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:07.598
I don't gotta answer
to nobody in this room.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.611
Nobody!

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.772
I don't play for none of y'all.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.247
Stupid.

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:15.614
You're right.
He don't play for us.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:16.743
Nope.

01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:19.617
So who do you play for, then, B?

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:22.684
Who you play for, B?

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:24.521
Huh?

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:25.754
Oh, what, you crying, now?

01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:26.817
Get your ass out my face.

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:27.954
Who you balling for, huh?

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:28.962
Get out of my face, little man.

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.760
Who you playing for, huh?

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:31.765
Oh, what, you can't speak now?

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:33.131
Man, you better tell me something.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.033
- Who you playing for?
- My brother.

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:42.206
My brother.

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.987
Go on.

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:58.449
My big brother Ray.

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:01.887
The boy was the best ever.

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.758
Do it all over the court, you know.

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:10.238
All State.
Second team All American.

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:14.272
Boy was going to the next level,
and the next.

01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:15.605
Mm-hmm.

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:19.914
And then, uh...

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:23.577
Some old stupid-ass
drunk fool killed him.

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:27.521
He was riding his motorcycle,
you know?

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.251
Killed my brother.

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:34.455
My daddy, uh...

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:37.226
He wanted to jump in
the casket with him.

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:41.902
Yeah, that day was crazy, that...

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:44.337
That was a hard day for us.

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:46.398
Um...

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:48.500
That boy.

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:51.241
You don't know what it's like.

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:53.373
Y'all don't know what
it's like to try to fill

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.417
them big ass shoes, boy.

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:57.418
I know you don't.

01:05:57.486 --> 01:05:59.647
4:30 in the morning.

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:02.282
Shooting jumpers till
you can't feel your hands.

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:04.724
You did that?
Hmm?

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:09.197
5:30 running sprints
till your feet bleed?

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:14.195
That's my daddy.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.932
That's my daddy.

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:19.998
And I gotta make him proud.

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:22.067
And I'm going to make him...

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:23.543
You know what? I don't...

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:24.636
Y'all gotta play for your own reasons.

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:27.182
I gotta play for...

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:29.774
I gotta play for my brother.

01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:33.515
Hey, man,
I'm sorry about your brother.

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:37.252
Yeah, we down with you, bro.

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:39.954
We down with you, B.

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:41.758
Real tall.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.765
Me too, dawg.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.767
We're your teammates.

01:06:47.603 --> 01:06:49.298
We're your brothers now.

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:57.506
Brian:
You know, Coach Al said
only a fool don't change.

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:03.481
So, I guess...

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:06.487
if y'all down with me,

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:09.023
for real,

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:11.116
for real...

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:15.220
I'm down with you.

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:19.194
We got you, dawg.

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:23.937
We got you, dawg.

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.537
Come on, man, put it up.
Put it up, put it up.

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:30.670
Brothers on three.
Let's go.

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:31.838
One, two, three.

01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:34.045
Brothers!

01:07:34.116 --> 01:07:35.777
Announcer:
Please welcome
from Jefferson Parish,

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:38.513
the John Ehret Patriots!

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:51.793
Hey, Hey.

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:55.064
Dig a little deeper.
Dig a little deeper.

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:04.246
I feel like throwin' it up

01:08:04.313 --> 01:08:05.940
Throwin' it up,
throwin' it up

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:09.348
-I said I feel like...
- Score by Randolph!

01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:10.908
Throwin' it up, throwin' it up

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:14.012
A big win for the Patriots!

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.752
I feel like throwin' it up...

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:21.154
Al Collins and the Patriots
win their second game in a row.

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:24.563
Feel like throwin' it up,
throwin' it up

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:27.830
I feel like throwin' it up,
throwin' it up

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:30.234
Al Collins racks up
another win this time

01:08:30.305 --> 01:08:32.866
at the expense of East St. John.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.203
Sam:
You ever ask yourself, man,

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:35.868
why don't Ray Charles
and Stevie Wonder

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.310
ever record together?

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:38.937
Seems logical, right?

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:40.640
Probably because of
safety concerns, you know.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.741
They'd be both onstage
moving their heads.

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:43.876
They might bump heads
or something, right?

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.545
Knock each other out.

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:48.051
Look to help, fellas,
look to help.

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:50.983
Announcer:
42-30...

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.187
That's five wins in a row
for the Patriots.

01:08:53.261 --> 01:08:55.662
Stevie Wonder got that song
"Isn't She Lovely?"

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:57.790
Are you asking me, Stevie,
or are you telling me?

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.499
I guess he's trying to
find out if she's lovely

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:02.537
'cause he can't see her.

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:06.296
I feel like throwin' it up

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.468
Man, look at
our cheerleaders, bro.

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.671
They're like Heinz ketchup.

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:12.542
Just terrible, sloppy.

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:14.912
Look at them.
Look at the way them cheerlead.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.814
That's bad over there, bro.

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:18.854
Damn!
Mm-mm-mm.

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:24.756
And in high-school news,

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:27.990
we've got a Cinderella story that is
capturing the city's imagination.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:30.895
The John Ehret Patriots
have made the state playoffs

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.866
after their improbable
eight-game winning streak.

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:35.368
Their perseverance
against the odds

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:37.200
has given the flood-ravaged
city of New Orleans

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:38.831
reason to believe.

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:41.671
Wait, wait, wait. I brought something.
It's just shoes.

01:09:41.743 --> 01:09:43.939
- You got a size 12?
- Here, just for you.

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:45.207
Thank you.

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:49.450
We're going all the way
to the championship, baby!

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:57.516
What are the things
necessary for us to win?

01:09:57.593 --> 01:09:59.185
Brings the ball in to Randolph...

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:02.128
- Execution.
- All: Execution.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.688
- It's good!
- [Buzzer sounds]

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:06.064
- My effort.
- My effort.

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:08.296
- My will.
- My will.

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:10.304
- My thoughts.
- My thoughts.

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:11.964
- It will be...
- It will be...

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:13.474
- because of me.
- Because of me.

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:15.908
Come on in, fellas.

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:18.037
On three...
one, two, three!

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:19.410
Patriots!

01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:21.312
Unbelievable!

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:22.577
Here we are
at the state semi-finals,

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:24.551
and the underdog Patriots
are up by six!

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:26.952
Go for three!

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:35.559
Another missed opportunity
by the Patriots.

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:40.467
...supposed to be coming over.

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:42.504
That's the game?
That's the game right there.

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:43.538
Turn it up.

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:44.766
Get up and guard him!

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.637
Chief sails.

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:49.269
Stops. Pops. Hops!

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:50.903
Another three for the Chiefs.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:53.141
Oh, my, how the momentum
has changed!

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:57.311
The Chiefs are on a 12-3 run.

01:10:57.386 --> 01:10:59.718
Get the ball thrown to Randolph...

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:01.551
Take it down, baby!
Shoot the ball.

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:03.888
Brian, what are you doing?

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:08.423
You had the shot right at the key!

01:11:08.497 --> 01:11:10.397
Passing the ball off, that's soft!

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:12.457
Hey, Brian!
Good play.

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:28.607
It's all right, son.
Stay in the game.

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:30.276
Stay in the game.

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:35.414
The Chiefs have come back...

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:37.356
Oh, come on, D!
Play defense!

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:39.587
Keep your head on the game!
Keep your head on the game.

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:40.629
Come on, boys!

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:45.123
Patriots up by two.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.690
- Time out! Time out!
- [Whistle blows]

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.361
Time out!
30-second time out!

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:50.371
Come on, come on, fellas.

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:52.066
Good effort, good work.

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:55.536
All right, here we go.
We want to go straight.

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:58.637
No switching, no switching.
No fouls, no threes.

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.944
No fouls under
any circumstance, all right?

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:02.984
Either we get this down
or we go into overtime.

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:04.542
All right?
Patriots on three.

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.178
Right?
Here we go.

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:07.984
- One, two, three!
- All: Patriots!

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:09.183
Here we go.

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:11.886
They're putting in Number 21.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.757
They did this in Mandeville.

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:15.694
He's only got one play,

01:12:15.764 --> 01:12:18.358
a backdoor screen,
then lob the ball in the air

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:20.026
for an alley-oop.
The kid's a jumper.

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:24.129
Go, Chiefs! Go, Chiefs!

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:26.003
- Time out, ref!
- Time out.

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:33.240
Listen up.
They just subbed in Number 21,

01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:34.441
the big guy.

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:36.279
They like getting that backdoor lob.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.217
Okay, so we got to go fake man

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:40.152
to a match-up zone
so they can't throw it

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:41.450
over the top of us.

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:43.115
Here we go, fellas.
One, two, three!

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:45.126
Defense!
- Let's go!

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.185
Ball's come down
to the final possession.

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:48.854
Chiefs have the ball, side out,

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.831
trailing by two.

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:53.424
Come on! Come on, baby!
Come on, baby! Come on!

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.440
Here we go.

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.310
Guard him!

01:13:23.966 --> 01:13:25.456
Unbelievable!

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:27.661
Coach Collins
and the Patriots have made it

01:13:27.736 --> 01:13:29.135
to the state-championship game!

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:30.228
Pay up, baby.

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:33.575
We're going to the championship!

01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:34.904
That's what I'm talking about!

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:36.569
Let's tell the whole
goddamn world about this!

01:13:36.645 --> 01:13:37.907
Hey!

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.504
Yeah!

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:42.317
Yeah.

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:52.385
What's up, fellas?

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:55.521
Final four. Final two.

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.394
What's happening?

01:13:57.466 --> 01:14:00.799
- How you doing?
- Congratulations. Congratulations.

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:04.032
Doing good. All right?

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:05.801
It's quite a turnaround,

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:08.104
y'all playing Woodlawn in the finals.

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:09.735
Yeah, we...

01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:12.744
We're finally playing like a team.

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:14.282
What about me and you, son?

01:14:14.349 --> 01:14:15.907
I thought we was a team.

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:18.145
- Daddy, you know we still...
- I thought we decided

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:22.020
this was going to be your all-star,
all-state year.

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.115
Daddy, we're winning.

01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:27.390
Your coach is winning,
getting a lot of ink for himself.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:30.057
You are losing.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.157
If your brother was here,

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:35.761
we'd own this state
and everything in it.

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:44.042
Go on and get, boy.

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:47.013
Your team is waiting for you.

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:50.880
Good luck.
You're on your own.

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:28.089
Allen, what you doing here?

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:30.750
I canceled practice.

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:47.001
You trying to work me, Allen?

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:53.644
What about your team, Coach?

01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:55.740
You're my team.

01:15:57.452 --> 01:15:59.716
Don't you know that?
Come here.

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:15.059
Mr. Randolph.
Mr. Randolph.

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:27.215
I just came here
to ask you to come to the game.

01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:30.184
You know...

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:33.983
I know about your son Ray.

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:36.784
I'm really sorry for your loss.

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:39.122
I coached against him in the AAU.

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:40.855
He was on the Louisiana Select team.

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:43.625
He went up against mine.
He got 40.

01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:45.223
He dropped 20 in the semis.

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.460
42.

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:48.662
23.

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:49.999
Six blocks.

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:52.097
Brian's got that in him, too.

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:54.437
I want to help him be all right,

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:56.409
but there's only so much I can do.

01:16:56.478 --> 01:16:59.174
'Cause what the boy needs is you.

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:03.082
Get out of here.

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:08.414
All right.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:15.790
We'll get Nick with Courtney Wallace.

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:18.924
Brian with Spitz.

01:17:20.836 --> 01:17:22.133
Greg...

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:23.637
...in the finals against John Ehret?

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:25.866
I think our record speaks for itself.

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:28.341
I'm blessed with
the greatest player in the nation.

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:30.401
Of course, you're referring
to Spencer Walker,

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.413
who transferred to
number-one ranked Woodlawn

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:35.450
from Ehret earlier this year
after Hurricane Katrina.

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:39.078
Well, look, I respect the heck out of Ehret
and what they've overcome,

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.917
but we're not going to
take it easy on them.

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:42.354
We are a dominating team.

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:43.857
We will dominate this game.

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:47.019
I respectfully say
that the fairy tale is over.

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.357
Thank you, Coach Brown.
Good luck.

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:49.522
Thank you.

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.833
Welcome to the Cajun Dome

01:17:54.903 --> 01:17:59.806
and the Louisiana High School Basketball
State Championship!

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:15.087
Hey, we're sitting here right now

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:16.749
with Chris Paul from
the New Orleans Hornets,

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:19.123
and of course, Caron Butler with
the Washington Wizards.

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:21.890
Chris, I got to ask you, of course
being from a New Orleans team,

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:23.726
you've got to be here
tonight supporting

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:25.960
the other New Orleans team
on the court tonight,

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:27.262
the John Ehret Patriots.

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:28.802
Yeah, you know, we had an off-day,

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.895
so I decided to come out here
and see them play.

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:32.371
You know, being here in New Orleans,

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:34.636
I wanted to come out,
try to show them some support,

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.371
so hopefully John Ehret
can come out with the win.

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:38.905
This is your moment, fellas.

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:41.979
This is your time.

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:44.816
Let's bring it in.

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:45.853
Captain?

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:53.926
Christian:
The Lord is my shepherd...

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:56.088
I shall not want.

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:59.190
He maketh me lie down
in green pastures.

01:18:59.267 --> 01:19:00.461
And now,

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:02.662
with a record of 21 and 11,

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:05.263
from Jefferson Parish, Louisiana,

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:09.003
the John Ehret Patriots!

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:11.446
Son.

01:19:11.513 --> 01:19:12.810
Son.

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:18.776
Hey.

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:26.417
Uh, I don't like
watching basketball on TV.

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:31.023
You can't see what's going on
on the inside, you know.

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:34.660
Yeah. You got to get up close

01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:36.260
if you want to see
what's going on inside.

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:37.327
Yeah.

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:44.408
I'm... glad you came.

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:45.741
Yeah.

01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:47.907
It's not what I know.

01:19:47.983 --> 01:19:50.474
It ain't how I was
taught to play the game,

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:53.817
but... you're here, you know?

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:57.947
Well, uh...

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.857
All I...

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:03.796
All I ever wanted you to be was...

01:20:03.865 --> 01:20:06.800
the best you, son.

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:10.704
Not anybody else.

01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:16.069
I wouldn't have it any other way.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:22.909
All right?

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:25.475
Thank you, Daddy.

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:26.851
Thank you, sir.

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:37.154
Now get out there
and win us the championship.

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:38.392
- All right?
- Yes, sir!

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:40.263
- All right.
- Yeah. [chuckles]

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:53.378
The head coach of the Patriots,

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:55.780
Al Collins!

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:59.116
John Ehret fans must
be really proud of their team

01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:00.552
for making it this far.

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:03.090
Oh! Here comes Daddy.

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:04.557
Let's show him our shirts, okay?

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:06.561
Coach!

01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:09.825
Coach! Coach!

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:17.265
With a record of 47 and 0...

01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:23.342
...the number-one team in Louisiana,

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:27.370
the Woodlawn Panthers!

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:36.322
Just keep your focus, guys.
Just basketball.

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:41.693
The head coach of the Panthers,
Preston Brown!

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:46.861
Rawr! Rawr!

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:47.924
Rawr!

01:21:48.003 --> 01:21:49.664
Patriots! Patriots!

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.670
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
we're going to start the game out

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.339
in a two-three zone.

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:03.248
All right, fellas, let's come out hard
in the first five minutes.

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:06.947
Nick, Brian, Christian,
two-three zone!

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:08.546
Now, we are 47 and 0.

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:10.557
We're going to play smart,
we're going to play hard...

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:11.819
they cannot hang with it.

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:13.360
Let's win this!

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:16.327
- Patriots on three.
- On three.

01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:18.127
- One, two, three.
- All: Patriots!

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:19.996
Panthers!

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:31.939
Whoo!

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:34.447
All right!
Go, Patriots!

01:22:34.516 --> 01:22:35.881
Let's go.

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:38.385
Patriots about to lose.
All day, you already know.

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:40.918
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:43.890
it's showtime!

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:51.828
Panthers score!

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:55.330
Man, told you so.

01:22:56.838 --> 01:22:58.931
What, you never seen
anybody lob a ball before?

01:22:59.007 --> 01:23:00.872
Wake up!
Let's go!

01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:06.309
Stolen by the Panthers,

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:09.009
down court to dunk it.

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:10.745
Slams it!
Ooh.

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:17.517
The Patriots have yet
to put up any points

01:23:17.592 --> 01:23:19.321
on the scoreboard.

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:23.158
Let's go, let's go.
We need to score now.

01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:24.357
Let's go, let's go.

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:27.662
Settle down, fellas!

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:28.862
Settle down!

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:32.730
To Verdin.

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:35.037
And it's... air ball!

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:39.376
Ref, time!
Time!

01:23:39.447 --> 01:23:42.712
You know, the Patriots
just seem out of sync tonight.

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:47.153
Randy Verdin is having a tough time
from three-point lane.

01:23:47.222 --> 01:23:50.282
Guys, guys, guys!
Fellas, you got to settle down!

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:53.156
All right, don't let your heads
get caught up in the lights.

01:23:53.228 --> 01:23:55.219
Just relax.
Play your game.

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:57.888
Gary, I want you in for Christian.

01:23:57.966 --> 01:23:59.263
I want you to settle down a little bit.

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:01.165
- Come on!
- Let's go, y'all.

01:24:01.236 --> 01:24:02.498
- Come on, baby.
- One, two, three.

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:03.832
Defense!

01:24:03.905 --> 01:24:05.736
- Okay, Coach.
- I need you to do this, all right?

01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:10.043
Just give yourself a minute, Christian.

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:13.043
Gary Davis with the ball.

01:24:15.116 --> 01:24:16.913
Go, go!

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:18.612
Defense!

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:21.855
Randolph.

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:23.447
Rejected!

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:27.755
Ohh!

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:31.093
- He's out.
- Huh?

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:34.759
Give us some room, son

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:39.865
- You all right, son?
- I'm all right.

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:42.374
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:43.809
he appears to be okay.

01:24:43.878 --> 01:24:47.109
How about a hand for Number 3,
Gary Davis?

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.782
Well, that'll do it for the first half.

01:24:50.852 --> 01:24:53.252
Panthers go to the locker room
with a 19-point lead.

01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:55.687
We're about to lose this game, fellas.

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:59.788
We're beating ourselves in the first half.

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:02.022
You're not boxing out,
you're not hitting the boards...

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:03.962
they're totally dominating you!

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:06.125
You're running scared.
What's going on?

01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:16.575
Hey, Coach?

01:25:16.644 --> 01:25:18.509
Could you cut the lights off for me?

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:41.501
What does this remind y'all of?

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:53.771
Katrina.

01:25:53.848 --> 01:25:58.547
You were exiled by a hurricane, fellas.

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:01.688
You lost your homes,

01:26:01.756 --> 01:26:03.951
people that you love.

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:09.621
You were even called refugees
in your own country!

01:26:09.697 --> 01:26:11.790
You're not refugees.

01:26:11.866 --> 01:26:14.164
You're Americans.

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:15.600
Patriots even.

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:18.663
And a whole lot of folks

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.901
thought that you would
never succeed.

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:22.670
But that's all right.

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:26.078
That's okay.

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:29.275
Because no matter
what happens tonight,

01:26:30.552 --> 01:26:32.144
you've already won.

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:36.418
Because you refuse
to give up on yourselves.

01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:40.120
You refuse to give up
on your teammates.

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:42.891
And you refuse to give up
on New Orleans.

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:47.799
Who in this locker room
is going to give up tonight?

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:51.197
You've already faced the storm.

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:52.830
You've looked at that monster,

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:56.434
you've looked at her in the eye,
and you survived it.

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:58.274
'Cause you're here!

01:26:58.346 --> 01:27:00.439
You are here!
You already won!

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:05.408
I just need you to give me 16 minutes.

01:27:05.486 --> 01:27:08.319
You give yourself...

01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:11.881
16 minutes of your best.

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:15.122
And win or lose,

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:17.664
you will always have this moment.

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:21.834
You will always have each other.

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:25.304
And you will always have yourself.

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:30.739
Who wants to play some basketball?

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:35.206
I do, Coach.

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:46.522
Who wants to play some basketball?

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:47.754
I do, Coach!

01:27:47.829 --> 01:27:50.195
Who wants to play some basketball?

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:51.698
I do, Coach!

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:53.757
Who's going to play some basketball?

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:54.802
I am, Coach!

01:27:54.869 --> 01:27:56.063
Well, let's play!

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:58.332
Patriots on three!

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:00.271
- One, two, three!
- Patriots!

01:28:00.608 --> 01:28:01.836
Come on!

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:04.745
Go, son!

01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:11.650
Go, Brian!

01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:12.879
Damn it.

01:28:20.595 --> 01:28:21.755
Slam dunk!

01:28:27.769 --> 01:28:29.168
Walker passes down the court...

01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:33.430
Well, Coach Al Collins
must have told them

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:34.998
that the house is on fire

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:36.566
'cause that's how they're playing now.

01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:38.373
The Patriots are back in this game.

01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:40.607
Way to play, fellas.
Way to play.

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:42.274
This is what we're after.

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:45.148
You keep this up,
we'll get back in this game.

01:28:45.219 --> 01:28:47.016
I mean, what is going on?

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:51.156
Did you just leave it
all in the locker room?

01:28:51.225 --> 01:28:54.956
You're going to piss away
a huge lead in a blink.

01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:56.428
All right,
let's spread it out a little bit.

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:58.397
We try to knock out shots
from the outside,

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:00.832
get those big guys
to come out and guard us.

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:02.335
These boys can play the game.

01:29:02.403 --> 01:29:05.634
You know what?
Why don't you step up?

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:06.935
Why don't you beat them, all stars?

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:09.909
Let's do a 29 box to Randy.

01:29:09.977 --> 01:29:11.877
Coach, I haven't been
really hitting them.

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:14.073
Just shoot till you miss, son.
Shoot till you miss.

01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:15.410
Randy, you can do this.

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:17.314
Get in here.
Let's make this a ball game.

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:18.317
- Wake up.
- One, two, three.

01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:19.853
Brothers!

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:21.388
Come on! Come on!

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.629
Patriots move the ball around.

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:35.032
Randy Verdin to the open three!

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:37.435
It's good!

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:38.938
Yes.

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:42.736
The Patriots have pulled within nine!

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:45.005
All right!
Let's do it again!

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:46.603
Come on, Patriots!

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:54.782
Pass to Verdin for three.

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:56.983
He nails it!

01:29:58.393 --> 01:30:00.725
Go, get back, get back!

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:21.374
D-up!

01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:25.581
Johnson dunks it to Walker.

01:30:26.687 --> 01:30:28.211
Oh, he's fouled.

01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:36.861
That's his fourth, Coach.
We need to take him out now.

01:30:38.132 --> 01:30:40.657
- David.
- Yes, sir.

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:43.169
- Why don't you get in for Brian?
- Okay, Coach.

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:53.212
It's probably because you're tired.

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:55.249
Just give yourself a moment.

01:30:57.552 --> 01:31:01.283
54 to 50,
with 4:45 left in the game.

01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:04.887
No!

01:31:04.959 --> 01:31:06.620
No, no, no!

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:08.628
Christian!

01:31:08.696 --> 01:31:10.288
33! 33!

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:13.026
- I can't!
- Good call! You're the captain.

01:31:14.502 --> 01:31:15.730
Go deep!

01:31:15.803 --> 01:31:17.236
Go deep!

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:24.773
David cutting through the paint.

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:26.575
Two points to the Patriots!

01:31:29.784 --> 01:31:31.615
Gary Davis scores.

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:34.416
The Patriots have forced the Panthers
out of their zone.

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:36.889
The Patriots have
their first lead of the game!

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:38.289
Get back!

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:42.262
Ooh!

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:45.432
We're all tied up!

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.934
Brian, I need you to go back in, son.

01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:49.196
You're in!

01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:55.607
Woodlawn with the ball
and a chance to break the tie.

01:31:59.747 --> 01:32:01.874
There's greatness inside of you, son.

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:04.912
But you got to believe in it.

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:09.249
You're not out here by yourself.

01:32:09.323 --> 01:32:10.984
You got your whole team out here!

01:32:12.827 --> 01:32:15.057
This is your time.

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:16.562
This is your moment.

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:27.004
All right, Brian!

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:31.435
Stay on your feet!

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:34.911
Brian, run!

01:32:34.982 --> 01:32:36.108
Nick, Nick, Nick!

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:41.146
It looks like
the Panthers put the game

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:43.417
in the hands of their star,
Spencer Walker.

01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:46.426
The Panthers spread out
and isolate him against Randolph.

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:52.493
Ohh!

01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:57.401
Blue was out of bounds!
White ball!

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:59.405
Patriots' ball!

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.311
That's a good play, Coach.
That's a good play.

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:06.403
Time out.

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:14.882
All right, guys.

01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:17.117
We're exactly where we want to be.

01:33:17.191 --> 01:33:20.627
We got the ball and a chance to win
the state championship.

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:23.357
So, everybody, just relax.

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:24.898
Just relax.

01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:26.160
This is what we're going to do.

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:27.723
Sit down!

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:28.928
Sit down.

01:33:29.003 --> 01:33:30.265
Look, look.

01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:32.203
All right, fellas,
we got eight seconds.

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:34.138
That's all we got to do...
we got eight seconds...

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:35.869
hold these boys down,
slow them down.

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:37.535
Don't let them get
that ball up the court fast.

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:39.307
Then we're going to go
into four minutes overtime,

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:40.642
then we're going to kick their ass.

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:43.411
We're going to run a four-man stack.

01:33:43.484 --> 01:33:45.850
We are not going to let this ball
get behind us.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.945
Brian, you're the last man on the stack.

01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:49.683
I want you to come around the top,

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:51.190
as fast as your legs will carry you.

01:33:51.258 --> 01:33:52.850
They're probably going to
double-team you,

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:55.088
so look to Christian
coming up the middle

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:57.255
and Nick coming up the side.

01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:59.094
You're going to follow Randolph.

01:33:59.166 --> 01:34:01.327
They're probably going to
try to get him on the baseball pass.

01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:02.926
Don't let that boy get behind you.

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:04.835
- It's time to move earth, fellas.
- Let's go.

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:07.499
- Let's go, y'all.
- Let's go, come on.

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:09.770
- Let's go, y'all.
- Come on, now. Patriots on three, y'all.

01:34:09.844 --> 01:34:12.176
- One, two, three.
- All: Patriots!

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:24.521
Hey, go, go.

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:35.866
Crowd chanting:
Patriots! Patriots!

01:35:00.661 --> 01:35:02.128
Go, go, go!

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:13.334
Get back, get back!

01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:33.826
Patriots!
All right! All right!

01:35:40.434 --> 01:35:45.633
The winners and the Louisiana
State Champions...

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:49.608
the John Ehret Patriots!

01:35:57.384 --> 01:36:01.150
Come on.
What you laughing for, dawg?

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:02.814
Why are you laughing?

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:05.518
I bet with the Patriots.

01:36:07.495 --> 01:36:09.019
Good game, son.

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:51.233
I'm so proud of you!

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:53.565
We did it!

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:54.733
Look at that!

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:56.208
Whoo!

01:36:56.277 --> 01:36:59.337
I said I feel like throwin' it up

01:36:59.413 --> 01:37:01.108
Throwin' it up, throwin' it up

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:03.980
I said I feel like throwin' it up

01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:05.780
Throwin' it up, throwin' it up

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:08.788
I said I feel like throwin' it up

01:37:11.525 --> 01:37:13.652
Coach, Coach,
Coach, Coach.

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:14.853
Come on, man, come on.

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:16.726
This is for y'all.

01:37:16.797 --> 01:37:18.628
Go, Patriots!

01:37:18.699 --> 01:37:21.600
- One, two, three.
- All: Patriots!

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:23.864
Feel like throwin' it up...

01:37:37.818 --> 01:37:41.584
...the State Farm Class 5A
Championship trophy

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:42.917
to the John Ehret Patriots.

01:37:47.862 --> 01:37:49.887
Head Coach Allen Collins!

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:53.331
Coach Collins, I know y'all had to
regroup four or five times

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:54.731
after Katrina.

01:37:54.802 --> 01:37:56.064
And for a public school
from New Orleans

01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:57.728
to win a state championship

01:37:57.805 --> 01:37:59.932
in a year like they've
had in New Orleans,

01:38:00.007 --> 01:38:01.474
what does it mean
for that community?

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:03.237
I told the fellas before the game

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:06.837
I didn't know why
God had selected them,

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:09.212
but we knew our guys
would compete like hell.

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:10.978
And if you could get a bunch of people

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:13.849
with their backs against the wall
to fight like hell,

01:38:13.921 --> 01:38:15.479
you can do some pretty special stuff.

01:38:18.659 --> 01:38:20.024
What it feel like?

01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:21.721
Receive the rewards and respect

01:38:21.795 --> 01:38:23.319
That all your hard work earned

01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:24.796
What it feel like?

01:38:24.865 --> 01:38:26.423
When the coach say,
"Get in the game"

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:27.933
And you finally do get a chance

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:29.560
What it feel like?

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:31.696
Three seconds on the clock
when you need to find a shot

01:38:31.772 --> 01:38:33.034
And you win the game

01:38:33.107 --> 01:38:34.233
What it feel like?

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:35.969
Stuck, head down, gave up

01:38:36.043 --> 01:38:37.670
Then our luck, it begin to change

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:38.973
What it feel like?

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:40.513
When a son and his dad's locked up

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:42.208
And the mother cries all night

01:38:42.283 --> 01:38:43.511
What it feel like?

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:45.245
Then you finally get
promoted with a raise

01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:47.048
And you get the money you deserve

01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:48.315
What it feel like?

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:49.947
When you up at the plate,
full count

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:51.651
Ninth inning
and you down a run

01:38:51.725 --> 01:38:52.885
What it feel like?

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:54.018
Then you knock it out the park

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:56.460
Grand slam, home run,
now your team won

01:38:57.932 --> 01:38:59.365
Life gets hard sometimes

01:38:59.433 --> 01:39:02.266
But you know
it's gonna be all right

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:06.864
Not gonna run, and we not givin' up,
no, we gonna fight

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:11.378
If anybody asks how we are,
let them know that we all right

01:39:11.445 --> 01:39:13.675
But when the time comes,
you're gonna shine so bright

01:39:13.747 --> 01:39:15.180
Let them see your light

01:39:15.249 --> 01:39:16.216
What it feel like?

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:17.682
When your mom don't believe

01:39:17.751 --> 01:39:19.878
And you're next and you
always feel left out

01:39:19.954 --> 01:39:21.080
What it feel like?

01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:22.554
Went to school, came home

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:24.284
No job, now you're sitting
there stressed out

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:25.882
What it feel like?

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.518
Receive the rewards and respect

01:39:27.594 --> 01:39:29.323
That all your hard work earned

01:39:29.396 --> 01:39:30.328
What it feel like?

01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:31.864
Sad but you smile

01:39:31.932 --> 01:39:34.025
'Cause you just heard
your baby say his first word

01:39:34.101 --> 01:39:36.296
What it feel like? â™ªThree seconds on the clock

01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:38.736
When you need to find a shot
and you win the game

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.103
What it feel like?

01:39:40.174 --> 01:39:41.573
Stuck, head down, gave up

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:43.405
Then your luck, it begin to change

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:44.739
What it feel like?

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:46.507
When the son
and his dad's locked up

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:47.808
And the mother cries
all night

01:39:47.881 --> 01:39:49.075
What it feel like?

01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:50.446
When they both come home

01:39:50.517 --> 01:39:52.508
Not alone no more, so it's all right...

01:39:58.158 --> 01:40:00.683
Who told you life would be easy?

01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:03.753
Who said you would
smile every day?

01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:06.026
Don't ask me to try to explain it

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:09.331
But it just don't work out that way

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:10.995
You'll rise in the morning

01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:15.132
And know that that feeling will stay

01:40:15.209 --> 01:40:18.110
If you're young or you're old
or you're helpless

01:40:18.178 --> 01:40:21.011
If you just want to
go your own way

01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:23.481
You come from a town
that ain't workin'

01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:26.951
The blues come
each and every day

01:40:27.021 --> 01:40:28.318
You'll rise in the morning

01:40:28.389 --> 01:40:31.358
And know that that feeling will stay

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:35.353
The rain that comes down
in the morning

01:40:35.429 --> 01:40:38.592
The darkness that with the night

01:40:38.665 --> 01:40:41.532
The silence that comes
without warning

01:40:41.602 --> 01:40:44.070
The feeling that
something ain't right

01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:46.265
In this kind of life

01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:58.515
So try to arrange your emotions

01:40:58.585 --> 01:41:01.281
Say, in time, they will all go away

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:03.823
And by living for all you're worth

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:07.258
You somehow get through the day

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:08.794
But you'll rise in the morning

01:41:08.862 --> 01:41:11.831
And know that that feeling will stay

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:16.198
The rain that comes down
in the morning

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:19.068
The darkness that
comes with the night

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:21.903
The silence that comes
without warning

01:41:21.975 --> 01:41:24.375
The feeling that
something ain't right

01:41:24.445 --> 01:41:26.879
In this kind of life

01:41:59.746 --> 01:42:02.078
Who told you life would be easy?

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:05.277
Who said you would
smile every day?

01:42:05.352 --> 01:42:07.513
Don't ask me to try to explain it

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:11.024
But it just don't work out that way

01:42:11.091 --> 01:42:12.456
You'll rise in the morning

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:15.359
And know that that feeling will stay

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:19.630
The rain that comes
down in the morning

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:22.100
The darkness that comes
in the night...
