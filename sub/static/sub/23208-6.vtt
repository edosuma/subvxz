00:51.850 --> 00:53.600
What a shit tip!

00:53.630 --> 00:55.950
Neighbours have been
complaining for weeks.

00:57.109 --> 00:58.780
He was a hoarder, apparently.

00:58.810 --> 01:00.009
Get away.

01:01.340 --> 01:04.709
- It stinks.
- You'll get used to it.

01:05.909 --> 01:07.605
We've had worse than this,
haven't we, Keith?

01:07.629 --> 01:11.829
Oh, yes! This is a veritable potpourri
compared to Stanley Gardens.

01:11.859 --> 01:13.129
Oh, no, that was bad.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.010
Widow, been there 18 months,
nothing left of her.

01:17.039 --> 01:19.260
Just a pile of old lady
porridge on the settee.

01:19.289 --> 01:20.819
With a hat on top.

01:20.849 --> 01:22.799
Whoa, that's rank.

01:22.829 --> 01:24.250
That's the job, Mary.

01:24.329 --> 01:26.210
You never know
what lies in wait.

01:36.170 --> 01:38.270
I have to say,
you don't strike me as a Mary.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.090
People call me Maz.

01:40.129 --> 01:42.979
And you DO strike me as a Mary,
if you don't mind me saying.

01:43.009 --> 01:45.129
- Why, because I wear glasses?
- Basically, yes.

01:45.159 --> 01:48.930
The gentleman's name was
Frank Meggins, 68 years old.

01:49.420 --> 01:52.379
He fell through a glass coffee
table and bled out, apparently.

01:54.150 --> 01:56.025
Are you going to have to
change those floorboards?

01:56.049 --> 02:00.269
Yeah. We're also doing a probate
valuation and document search.

02:00.299 --> 02:02.799
Mr Meggins had no
living relatives, so,

02:02.859 --> 02:05.579
any clues will be beneficial
to sorting out the estate.

02:05.609 --> 02:07.489
Yeah,
because someone will be dying

02:07.519 --> 02:09.395
to get their hands on all
of this crap, won't they?

02:09.419 --> 02:11.289
Someone DID die, Mary.

02:11.539 --> 02:12.819
That's why we're here.

02:13.259 --> 02:17.079
Look at this! It looks like
Frank's numbers came up.

02:17.129 --> 02:19.189
What?! He won the lottery?!

02:19.219 --> 02:22.229
Looks like it. Maybe he was
a bit of a Howard Hughes,

02:22.259 --> 02:25.079
but without the germ phobia,
obviously.

02:25.110 --> 02:27.650
Why would you live in a
council flat full of shit

02:27.680 --> 02:30.009
- if you're a millionaire?
- Show some respect.

02:30.039 --> 02:31.259
Sorry, Keith.

02:31.759 --> 02:34.579
But seriously, 3.5 mil.

02:34.610 --> 02:39.729
I would be like, Ferrari, massive
mansion, special edition Yeezies.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.509
- What's that?
- Trainers.

02:41.650 --> 02:44.020
Oh, right, yeah. Push the
boat out, why don't you?

02:44.050 --> 02:45.569
A boat, why not!

02:45.599 --> 02:48.990
Although my dad did say, "If it
flies, floats or fucks, rent it."

02:49.020 --> 02:50.259
That's enough!

02:51.469 --> 02:54.170
Nick, go and show her how
to bag up the kitchen waste.

02:54.659 --> 02:57.210
I'll make a start on this Jenga.

02:58.460 --> 03:01.759
- He's a barrel of laughs, isn't he?
- Keith's all right.

03:02.680 --> 03:03.879
He means well.

03:05.180 --> 03:06.620
He's had a hard life.

03:10.930 --> 03:13.069
MS. He's...

03:14.310 --> 03:15.509
A rent boy?

03:15.789 --> 03:16.990
No...

03:17.199 --> 03:19.780
What? No! He's in a wheelchair.

03:21.210 --> 03:22.920
He's got a lot on his plate.
Here.

03:24.780 --> 03:27.009
Lesson one -
no matter who you are,

03:27.039 --> 03:31.629
people always have the same
things in their kitchen cupboards.

03:34.090 --> 03:35.289
Kidney beans.

03:37.139 --> 03:38.550
Peaches in syrup.

03:40.370 --> 03:42.259
Half a box of icing sugar.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.500
But not everyone has...

03:48.409 --> 03:51.120
- a dead rat.
- Urgh, get that away from me, man!

03:51.150 --> 03:53.256
- These need to be double-bagged, here.
- I'm not touching that.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.319
Come on, you can't be
squeamish in this job!

04:06.840 --> 04:08.539
- Hurry up, man!
- All right.

04:10.819 --> 04:12.020
Good.

04:12.229 --> 04:14.069
You can put Roland
by the front door.

04:14.099 --> 04:17.040
- Roland?
- Never mind. It's from the '80s.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.209
- Is it locked?
- Jesus!

06:14.250 --> 06:15.680
Are you trying to kill me?

06:17.560 --> 06:18.759
Yes.

06:20.009 --> 06:21.810
Look, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

06:21.939 --> 06:24.160
I don't know.
What are you thinking?

06:24.189 --> 06:26.730
3.5 million.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.250
Try this. 17-04-50.

06:43.939 --> 06:45.550
It's his wife's date of birth.

07:09.810 --> 07:11.009
Clever clogs.

07:28.470 --> 07:29.720
Is that it?

07:30.670 --> 07:32.389
Packages and a VHS.

07:32.420 --> 07:33.870
What's a VHS?

07:33.920 --> 07:35.600
It's from the '80s.

07:36.490 --> 07:39.659
I assume you were trying to find
a passport or will or some such?

07:39.689 --> 07:42.480
Exactly. We were just
trying to find his prostate.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.430
Probate.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.129
"Danger, do not open."

07:52.079 --> 07:53.279
Shall we open it?

07:53.639 --> 07:55.620
Of course. How can we not?

07:55.810 --> 07:58.000
It's better that we
have the full picture.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.439
Is that it?

08:32.039 --> 08:33.289
I bet it's full of drugs.

08:33.320 --> 08:36.000
- Smash it open.
- It feels pretty solid.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.100
Probably sentimental value.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.570
Why did it have
"Danger" written on it?

08:42.620 --> 08:44.769
We need to find a
player for this.

08:45.509 --> 08:48.250
Maz, you look in there.
Nick, check the kitchen.

08:49.889 --> 08:51.460
I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

08:52.769 --> 08:54.620
Oh,
I just had a horrible thought.

08:54.649 --> 08:56.889
What if it's
home-made pornography?

08:57.929 --> 09:00.899
I'm not sure I want to see old
Frank going at it with his fat wife.

09:00.929 --> 09:02.350
Keep it clean, you two.

09:02.379 --> 09:03.789
That's ironic!

09:03.850 --> 09:05.279
We just found a rat in here.

09:05.309 --> 09:07.919
- Dead or alive?
- Dead.

09:07.950 --> 09:09.179
We double-bagged it.

09:09.210 --> 09:11.559
- Good.
- Wish it WAS alive.

09:13.740 --> 09:15.159
Be less paperwork.

09:16.570 --> 09:17.769
Found it.

09:27.090 --> 09:28.570
There's nowhere to sit.

09:42.490 --> 09:46.289
By the time you see this
message, I hope to be free.

09:47.360 --> 09:51.429
Free from this terrible curse
that I've brought upon myself

09:51.460 --> 09:53.460
through greed and vanity.

09:53.490 --> 09:54.750
It's like Jackanory.

09:54.779 --> 09:58.360
- Don't tell me - '80s?
- Yep.

09:58.899 --> 10:04.009
Inside this package is an object
that has ruined countless lives,

10:04.039 --> 10:05.350
including mine.

10:06.580 --> 10:12.370
I got it many years ago for a small
fortune from a holy man in Jaipur.

10:12.399 --> 10:13.580
He got ripped off there.

10:13.610 --> 10:15.206
He could have got it
from IKEA for a tenner.

10:15.230 --> 10:19.019
- Quiet!
- He told me that this artefact

10:19.049 --> 10:24.850
would grant the bearer three wishes,
which would transform my life.

10:26.230 --> 10:28.679
And, for a while, it did.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.490
But after what
happened to Brenda...

10:36.440 --> 10:39.940
If you find this package,
I urge you,

10:39.970 --> 10:43.370
I implore you, do not open it.

10:43.669 --> 10:45.779
Send it away, destroy it.

10:45.809 --> 10:49.409
Our lives are ruled by fate,

10:49.820 --> 10:55.450
and those who interfere with
fate do so to their sorrow.

11:06.710 --> 11:08.870
No, he's not going to...

11:16.720 --> 11:18.029
That's very sad.

11:18.379 --> 11:20.909
I mean, where's social
services in all this, eh?

11:21.139 --> 11:22.610
Nobody cares any more.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.370
What's up?

11:34.029 --> 11:35.299
You heard what he said.

11:36.220 --> 11:37.929
That thing is dangerous.

11:38.750 --> 11:41.269
Oh, come on, Nick,
he was clearly delusional.

11:41.299 --> 11:43.046
He's lost his wife and
he couldn't accept it.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.889
It's classic displacement.

11:45.659 --> 11:47.960
Blaming a rabbit ornament
isn't going to bring her back.

11:47.990 --> 11:50.230
- It's a hare.
- So?

11:50.460 --> 11:53.320
Hares are associated with
witchcraft and trickery

11:53.350 --> 11:55.529
in almost every
culture in the world.

11:55.669 --> 11:56.830
How do you know?

11:56.860 --> 11:59.179
Because I did a PhD in
ethnology and folklore.

11:59.210 --> 12:01.879
Then, why are you here
acting as a glorified binman?

12:01.909 --> 12:04.289
Because it didn't get
me anywhere, did it?

12:05.539 --> 12:08.049
- Like having a degree in washing-up.
- Yeah, but, still.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.470
Well, let's just say I
made some bad choices.

12:15.389 --> 12:17.639
YOU were a rent boy!

12:18.460 --> 12:20.200
He was an alcoholic.

12:20.299 --> 12:21.960
Am an alcoholic.

12:23.330 --> 12:24.529
It never goes away.

12:25.620 --> 12:29.539
Fortunately, there are people
willing to give you a second chance.

12:31.399 --> 12:34.690
Look, why don't we put the man's
property back in the safe, eh?

12:34.720 --> 12:38.509
This glorified binman thinks
we've wasted enough time as it is.

12:57.220 --> 12:58.799
Guys, come here a second.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.759
You don't double-bag
a live rodent.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.809
- It was dead.
- Really?

13:11.840 --> 13:14.009
Yeah. I know a dead
rat when I see one.

13:14.039 --> 13:15.750
It's all right!
We all make mistakes.

13:15.779 --> 13:17.710
- I wished for it.
- What?

13:18.200 --> 13:20.009
Just now, in there,
I was holding the statue,

13:20.039 --> 13:22.015
I said, "I wish it was alive, it
would be a lot less paperwork."

13:22.039 --> 13:24.669
- Nick, calm down.
- No, he's right, he did.

13:25.039 --> 13:28.029
Damn. That means we've
only got two wishes left.

13:28.379 --> 13:30.135
- What do you mean?
- Well, you've used yours,

13:30.159 --> 13:31.535
you wished for the
rat to come alive.

13:31.559 --> 13:32.799
What? I was just making a joke.

13:32.830 --> 13:33.940
That's YOUR problem, mate.

13:33.970 --> 13:36.035
I could have had anything in the world
and I've ended up with a pet rat?!

13:36.059 --> 13:38.370
Well, it's very domesticated,
very clean.

13:38.399 --> 13:40.500
- Well, you have it, then!
- Excuse me.

13:55.440 --> 13:58.240
Sorry. Couldn't concentrate.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.710
Look, Nick, what we're dealing
with here is an old man,

14:03.740 --> 14:07.009
possibly with undiagnosed dementia,
who had a run of bad luck.

14:07.039 --> 14:09.870
Is one explanation.
But consider this. Maz?

14:09.899 --> 14:12.009
This is Frank's wife, Brenda.

14:12.039 --> 14:14.250
I'm not being rude but
she's a bit of a...

14:14.580 --> 14:17.600
- She's overweight.
- Yes, she's a beast.

14:18.679 --> 14:21.269
I think the word is obese.

14:21.659 --> 14:26.389
Anyway, within six months, she gets
ill and ends up looking like this.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.539
She had cancer, yes,
that's what happens.

14:31.570 --> 14:35.679
But here in Frank's diary, "Brenda
upset about her weight again.

14:35.710 --> 14:38.840
"Poor sausage. I wish there
was a way I could help her."

14:38.870 --> 14:41.539
- Poor sausage?
- You see? He wished for her to be thin,

14:41.570 --> 14:43.275
she gets cancer,
weight drops off, she dies.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.139
How could you even...?

14:44.169 --> 14:45.330
That's just sick.

14:45.360 --> 14:46.710
All right, look at this.

14:47.450 --> 14:49.500
3rd of September,
back from India.

14:49.529 --> 14:51.360
12th of September,
wins the Lottery.

14:51.389 --> 14:53.309
- You've said all this.
- 29th of September,

14:53.340 --> 14:55.659
sends his brother on a luxury
holiday to the Florida Keys.

14:55.690 --> 14:58.389
- So?
- Where he dies in a boating accident.

14:59.070 --> 15:01.230
- See?
- What?

15:01.279 --> 15:04.090
Every wish backfires.
It's throughout folklore.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.220
There's no way around it.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.549
After his wife dies, he sells
the big house in Highgate,

15:07.580 --> 15:10.570
he moves in here, starts frittering
away his money buying crap off eBay.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.820
That's because he was a hoarder.
It's an illness.

15:12.850 --> 15:15.855
It's because he was trying to get rid of
it by buying the most innocuous things.

15:15.879 --> 15:17.259
The money is cursed.

15:17.289 --> 15:19.269
This is just story-fying, Nick.

15:19.299 --> 15:21.059
You've developed an
overactive imagination

15:21.090 --> 15:22.539
cos of your fairy-tale degree.

15:22.570 --> 15:24.755
Have you been drinking the
antibacterial hand wash again?

15:24.779 --> 15:26.389
I did that once!

15:27.259 --> 15:31.620
All right, then, so,
what was his third wish?

15:33.990 --> 15:37.379
- I don't know. - Look, my point is,
we've got two wishes left

15:37.409 --> 15:38.505
what are we going
to use them on?

15:38.529 --> 15:42.100
Well, I wish we could just go back
to work and get this job done.

15:43.490 --> 15:45.149
That's not going to happen now,
is it?

15:45.179 --> 15:48.539
No, you have to be holding it.

15:52.460 --> 15:53.659
Come on.

15:55.299 --> 15:56.580
I know what we should do.

15:56.610 --> 15:58.379
We should wish for
unlimited wishes.

15:58.409 --> 16:00.759
- It won't work.
- What? How do you know?

16:01.059 --> 16:03.230
It never does.
You can't wish for anything

16:03.259 --> 16:05.879
that would alter the structure
of the wishing system itself.

16:10.909 --> 16:13.279
Can you make a start on
those floorboards, please?

16:13.309 --> 16:15.919
I've got an ATP fluorescence
booked in at 12 tomorrow.

16:15.950 --> 16:17.850
I need that room spotless.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.559
Grab that.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.950
Why don't we just ask for shitloads
of money, like, 50 million each?

16:39.980 --> 16:42.320
That's exactly what Frank did,
look what happened to him.

16:42.350 --> 16:44.159
Just a stain to get rid of.

16:47.250 --> 16:50.759
The wish-granter
is always vengeful.

16:51.580 --> 16:54.059
If you're greedy,
you pay the price.

16:54.090 --> 16:56.440
Yeah, but it's like the taxman,
isn't it?

16:56.470 --> 16:57.940
I claimed for a Happy Meal

16:57.970 --> 17:01.080
because I found a receipt in
the trolley outside Tesco.

17:01.110 --> 17:02.610
And he never came after me.

17:03.289 --> 17:06.150
I don't think you can compare
fate to the Inland Revenue.

17:10.490 --> 17:13.200
I wish for L93,000, please.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.950
- What are you doing?!
- What?

17:15.980 --> 17:18.049
That was very
carefully thought out.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.200
Not too much,
but enough to make a difference.

17:20.230 --> 17:21.430
- Give me that!
- Why?

17:21.460 --> 17:23.769
- You're an idiot.
- Everything all right?

17:23.799 --> 17:26.289
Yeah, we're just sorting
out the floorboards.

17:33.309 --> 17:34.666
You should not have wished
for that money, Maz.

17:34.690 --> 17:37.059
- Well, what, then?
- I don't know, something harmless.

17:37.089 --> 17:38.980
- An activity.
- An activity like what?

17:39.009 --> 17:41.779
Skydiving? Yeah, cos that
would end well, wouldn't it?

17:42.180 --> 17:43.769
Don't say I didn't warn you.

17:48.630 --> 17:50.279
When will I get it, anyway?

17:50.309 --> 17:51.359
What do you mean?

17:51.390 --> 17:53.216
When you I wished for your rat,
it was instant.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.250
- It's not my rat.
- I'm just saying,

17:55.279 --> 17:57.470
how long will it be
before I get my money?

18:40.680 --> 18:41.880
What?!

19:10.779 --> 19:12.190
What have you got there, Keith?

19:14.299 --> 19:16.599
I've come across some of
Frank's Lottery winnings.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.329
It looks like he didn't
spend it all, after all.

19:19.490 --> 19:21.119
And what are you doing with it?

19:21.819 --> 19:23.859
Well, you know the procedure,
Nick.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.869
This money has to be secured and taken
off the propertyas soon as possible.

19:28.539 --> 19:30.589
By stuffing it in
your coat pockets?

19:31.809 --> 19:34.519
I thought it would be safer
that way. But you're right.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.180
Best keep it all in one place.

19:37.619 --> 19:38.819
What's going on?

19:39.609 --> 19:41.059
Keith has found some money.

19:41.089 --> 19:43.579
Yes, looks to be in
the region of L100,000.

19:43.609 --> 19:47.170
93. It's mine,
Ijust wished for it.

19:47.470 --> 19:49.369
You do talk some rubbish, Mary.

19:49.609 --> 19:52.950
This money was just here,
nobody wished for it.

19:52.980 --> 19:54.789
Well,
how do you explain the rat?

19:55.940 --> 19:59.220
I can assure you, there's more than
one rat on this property, Nick,

19:59.250 --> 20:00.569
they're everywhere.

20:01.119 --> 20:01.970
Now, if you'll excuse me.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.200
You're not going.

20:04.279 --> 20:06.279
- What?
- That's my money.

20:06.319 --> 20:08.109
- You're not taking it.
- Maz!

20:08.140 --> 20:09.630
It belongs to me!

20:14.269 --> 20:15.759
Maz! Come back!

20:15.789 --> 20:17.200
Get the fuse box.

20:20.410 --> 20:21.609
Maz!

20:22.579 --> 20:23.779
Listen to me.

20:25.619 --> 20:27.519
If you take that money...

20:29.220 --> 20:31.569
something terrible
will happen to you.

20:35.470 --> 20:37.880
I know you're spooked.

20:39.769 --> 20:42.819
But that money is not yours.

20:47.299 --> 20:48.920
There's no point hiding.

20:49.029 --> 20:50.759
There's only three rooms.

21:17.289 --> 21:18.779
Don't come any closer!

21:19.519 --> 21:22.019
- Maz.
- I'm warning you, don't move,

21:22.049 --> 21:23.930
or I'll turn you
both into cushions.

21:24.779 --> 21:25.980
What?

21:26.240 --> 21:28.180
It's the first thing
that came into my mind.

21:28.369 --> 21:29.750
Think about what I said.

21:30.369 --> 21:31.779
You're being greedy.

21:32.019 --> 21:33.815
Remember the Happy Meal
in the Tesco's trolley.

21:33.839 --> 21:36.980
- It's not the same thing!
- I'm sorry, you've lost me now.

21:37.009 --> 21:41.880
Maz, you don't know what
your fate has in store.

21:42.039 --> 21:45.559
It could be that you are
going to be really rich.

21:46.640 --> 21:51.029
Don't meddle with it.
Just let it be a surprise.

21:51.099 --> 21:53.700
Thanks for the warning, Nick,
but I know what I want.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.279
I don't like surprises.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.119
Jesus.

22:26.769 --> 22:30.240
Don't touch anything, Nick, you don't
want to contaminate the evidence.

22:34.039 --> 22:35.349
We've still got one wish left.

22:35.380 --> 22:37.005
- I could wish for Maz
to come back to life. - Nick.

22:37.029 --> 22:39.085
But then she'd be brain-damaged, of
course, just like in The Monkey's Paw,

22:39.109 --> 22:40.176
when the son comes
back all mangled.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.880
Nick, Nick, you're babbling.

22:42.269 --> 22:44.660
Why don't you go home
now and I'll sort this?

22:44.690 --> 22:46.500
- Yeah, but what about Maz?
- She's gone.

22:48.089 --> 22:49.369
She's gone.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.200
It was an accident at work,
we both saw it.

22:53.819 --> 22:56.325
I'll alert the authorities, I'll
take the money back to the office

22:56.349 --> 22:58.779
and in the morning i'll
reassign the case, OK?

22:59.329 --> 23:00.529
Yeah, will you, though?

23:02.890 --> 23:04.089
What do you mean?

23:04.950 --> 23:06.309
Take the money back?

23:06.880 --> 23:08.420
I saw what you
were doing with it.

23:08.450 --> 23:09.710
I explained all that.

23:09.740 --> 23:12.789
Keith, I've known you 12 years.

23:12.819 --> 23:14.380
Don't lie to me, please.

23:16.940 --> 23:18.140
Ok.

23:19.869 --> 23:21.569
Ok, 50/50.

23:22.019 --> 23:24.180
- What?
- We'll split it, 45 grand each.

23:24.210 --> 23:26.539
No-one knew it ever existed,
it's not a crime.

23:26.569 --> 23:27.956
Keith, I don't want anything
to do with that money,

23:27.980 --> 23:28.985
we've got to get rid of it,
burn it!

23:29.009 --> 23:31.029
I can't burn it, Nick!

23:31.349 --> 23:33.470
This money is a godsend to me.

23:33.549 --> 23:36.000
This could pay for
Charlie's operation.

23:37.509 --> 23:39.490
Yes. Yes, maybe.

23:39.519 --> 23:42.160
In the stories, people always
make self-serving wishes,

23:42.190 --> 23:44.245
use it for something good,
there'll be no retribution.

23:44.269 --> 23:46.490
There's no such thing as wishes!

23:48.029 --> 23:50.880
There is no magic,
there's no short cuts!

23:51.589 --> 23:55.299
If you hadn't found that stupid
video, Maz would still be alive!

23:55.569 --> 23:58.140
We could have just done
this job and gone home.

24:00.109 --> 24:03.849
Hang on a minute. We found
that video locked in the safe.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.700
So?

24:05.930 --> 24:08.759
It was his suicide video.
Who put it there?

24:09.329 --> 24:12.119
- What are you trying to say?
- Maybe Frank isn't dead.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.710
- Frank is dead, Nick.
- Yes, but how do you know?

24:14.740 --> 24:16.250
Because I killed him!

24:38.009 --> 24:40.220
The trouble with these
old properties is...

24:41.369 --> 24:42.819
They're deathtraps.

24:45.869 --> 24:49.529
Especially... if
you've been drinking.

24:53.730 --> 24:55.970
I'd heard rumours there
might be money here.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.890
The neighbours have been in,
complaining about the smell.

25:01.420 --> 25:03.369
So I arranged a home visit.

25:06.849 --> 25:08.819
I told Frank about Charlie...

25:10.160 --> 25:13.339
Asked him if he could help me
out, but he wouldn't listen.

25:15.009 --> 25:16.319
We argued.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.420
I lost my temper.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.019
Next thing I know...

25:21.980 --> 25:23.200
He was dead.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.359
So, you see, Nick,

25:27.230 --> 25:31.329
it's got nothing to do
with your stupid wishes.

26:12.259 --> 26:15.160
I am so hungry.

26:16.230 --> 26:18.980
I don't know what's
happened to all my food.

26:21.710 --> 26:22.910
Frank?

26:23.460 --> 26:26.619
- What are you doing here?
- This is my flat.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.410
Where else am I going to go?

26:33.490 --> 26:34.690
But you're dead!

26:34.720 --> 26:38.259
I had some tinned peaches
in here somewhere.

26:40.069 --> 26:41.900
I know you, don't I?

26:42.049 --> 26:43.759
You came from the council.

26:46.339 --> 26:50.410
One minute you're trying
to help me, and the next...

26:51.180 --> 26:54.059
You're pushing me through
a glass coffee table.

26:55.069 --> 26:57.589
Yes, sorry about that.

26:59.720 --> 27:03.619
- I have a son, you see.
- Yes, I remember you saying.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.160
We try and help
the ones we love.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.769
I understand that.

27:11.309 --> 27:15.240
I tried to help my wife,
but it didn't work out.

27:16.799 --> 27:21.019
I also wished to be rich,
and now look at me.

27:22.420 --> 27:24.329
What was your third wish, Frank?

27:24.950 --> 27:27.170
I thought you'd have
guessed that by now.

27:27.619 --> 27:31.349
What's the point of being rich
if you can't live forever?

27:32.809 --> 27:34.680
So that videotape...

27:34.859 --> 27:39.890
I've tried countless times
to end it all, but I can't.

27:40.470 --> 27:43.819
Like a bad penny,
I keep coming back.

27:44.299 --> 27:47.109
It's a living hell,
and I'm trapped in it.

27:48.380 --> 27:50.650
Don't make the same
mistake I made.

27:50.700 --> 27:52.779
Be careful what you wish for.

27:58.930 --> 28:00.130
Here.

28:01.849 --> 28:03.319
This belongs to you.

28:05.130 --> 28:06.329
Thank you.

28:06.650 --> 28:08.119
I'll make us some tea.

28:14.980 --> 28:16.279
Keith!

28:28.109 --> 28:31.740
Here you go.
You've got a visitor.

28:35.329 --> 28:39.279
- Charlie?
- Look, Daddy, I can walk!

28:42.539 --> 28:44.289
I wished it for you, Keith.

28:45.170 --> 28:46.410
It's what you deserve.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.839
Oh, my boy, my beautiful boy.

28:48.990 --> 28:50.190
Daddy?

28:50.880 --> 28:52.480
What's that smell?

28:53.960 --> 28:55.190
Oh, no.
