WEBVTT

00:38.247 --> 00:41.410
It's 1:00. It's 1:00 in the afternoon.

00:41.626 --> 00:42.741
I got a game!

00:43.878 --> 00:46.745
What the hell happened to the alarm?
I'm supposed to be on the ice.

00:46.923 --> 00:47.878
You say, ne/n .

00:49.425 --> 00:52.508
- Yeah, nine. 9:00. What happened?
- Yeah, ne/n.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.589
Badge. Shirt.

00:54.764 --> 00:57.221
You say, "Ne/n alarm." ls mistake?

00:57.433 --> 00:59.389
No. No mistake.

00:59.602 --> 01:03.936
This is great. Late for the Olympics.
I'm just about four hours late, Rita.

01:05.483 --> 01:07.565
- "Rita"?
- I don't believe this.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.320
"Rita"?

01:11.948 --> 01:14.189
- Leta?
- "Leta"?

01:23.167 --> 01:24.122
Anita.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.284
Namen, Gita.

01:26.462 --> 01:28.123
Gita!

02:01.038 --> 02:03.450
This is the Olympics, Kate.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.366
Thirty million people called
their families in from the kitchen

02:06.544 --> 02:08.626
to watch the replay.
What do you think this is, Kate?

02:08.838 --> 02:11.295
Junior Pairs '82?

02:12.508 --> 02:16.296
No. As I recall, in '82 you were
still humiliating me in private.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.301
Maybe because
you were still listening.

02:18.514 --> 02:23.099
If I'm going deaf, it's because I've had
you screaming in my ear for nine years!

02:24.061 --> 02:26.313
He's not giving me anything
to work with.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.146
Rick, this is impossible.

02:30.735 --> 02:33.693
I wanna see your ass in the air.

02:42.997 --> 02:47.536
Until Hercules here learns how
to lock his grip, this will have to do.

03:02.558 --> 03:04.514
- Name, son?
- Dorsey, US hockey.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.767
Hell, son,
they're just about to start.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.851
Kate, this has to stop right now.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.198
Rick knows what's best, honey.
He got us here.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.698
How sweet. He lets us tag along.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.575
You're gonna go back out there,
you're going to apologize

03:23.746 --> 03:25.407
and you're gonna get to work.

03:26.499 --> 03:28.239
I wouldn't bet the ranch, Dad.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.454
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'll be in my cell.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.949
What... What are you...?

04:01.158 --> 04:04.400
Does this go up to the ice?
Does this go up to the ice?

04:04.578 --> 04:06.489
- What?
- Does this go up to the ice?

04:07.123 --> 04:09.580
Is that all you have to say?
Were you raised in a barn?

04:10.334 --> 04:12.575
Honey, where I'm from,
we stand for the national anthem.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.760
[f you ’re just joining us
from the men ’5 downhill,

04:23.931 --> 04:25.592
you ’re in for a big surprise.

04:25.808 --> 04:29.300
West Germany was supposed to be
an easy game for the United States,

04:29.478 --> 04:32.811
but here in the third period
and West Germany is up by a goal.

04:33.023 --> 04:36.481
Doug Dorsey, just about down
to the last dime of a two-minute penalty

04:36.694 --> 04:38.810
- for high-sticking. He can ’t wait.
- Come on./

04:39.029 --> 04:40.985
- Neither can the fans.
- Come on.

04:41.157 --> 04:45.150
Four, three, two, one.

04:46.036 --> 04:49.028
Dorsey running out of the
box. They’ll hit mm with the breakaway.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.492
It’s offs/de.

04:51.667 --> 04:54.454
Doug Dorsey, the phenom
from Ma yhorn, Minnesota.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.119
What a super story.
Here ’5 a junior from Minnesota State.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.004
Talk about being on the fast track.

04:59.175 --> 05:01.040
There are at least 12 NHL clubs

05:01.218 --> 05:03.709
that would love him on their roster
before the season ’5 over.

05:03.888 --> 05:06.550
An incredible young athlete.
If you haven ’t seen him before,

05:06.724 --> 05:08.464
you ’re in for a real treat.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.019
No question,
we ’re talking about one of the finest

05:11.187 --> 05:13.018
in amateur hockey today.

05:13.189 --> 05:17.228
There was a piece this week. One writer
called him the ’M/nnesota Machine ”.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.518
USA, USA, USA!

07:36.749 --> 07:37.989
For the record...

07:39.501 --> 07:42.709
...you've lost 18 degrees
of peripheral vision in your right eye.

07:44.173 --> 07:47.131
Now, in most cases, this would be
considered an inconvenience.

07:47.885 --> 07:50.126
- But for a hockey player...
- So how long before it comes back?

07:53.515 --> 07:56.803
You've had extreme trauma
to your occipital lobe.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.308
Doc, how long?

08:01.106 --> 08:02.846
You got a blind side, Doug.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.315
It's a permanent condition.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.492
- So there's an operation, right?
- I'm afraid not.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.652
Some micro-laser thing.
You open me up and...

08:15.829 --> 08:19.071
Doug, I've specialized in ophthalmic
surgery for over 15 years.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.410
OK, you don't do it,
but somebody, somewhere.

08:21.585 --> 08:24.372
Down in Mexico City,
they shoot shark piss up your nose,

08:24.546 --> 08:26.286
make you sit in traction
for eight months.

08:26.465 --> 08:29.172
Doug... I'm sorry.

08:30.928 --> 08:33.260
I don't see professional hockey
in your future.

09:05.921 --> 09:09.664
- See you at the game tonight, Doug.
- Not if I see you first.

09:09.842 --> 09:11.958
- See you, Mike.
- Mike.

09:12.136 --> 09:14.718
- Anybody seen my wife?
- See you guys later.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.386
Ice-time meltdown.

09:20.602 --> 09:23.139
You ’re listening to WICl/,
Duluth, Minnesota.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.850
We ’re gonna warm you up...

09:34.450 --> 09:36.236
- Hi, Doug.
- In a hurry. Any mail?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.651
- No.
- I got a game. Make me a sandwich.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.411
Hey, little brother,
Snyder can't make it. I need a hand.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.493
- I got a game.
- Hi, Dougie.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.204
- It's Friday night.
- Make me a sandwich.

09:46.378 --> 09:49.211
- I need a hand.
- I need a sandwich.

09:50.049 --> 09:51.630
Dougie, wait a minute.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.464
Doug, I got no place else to go.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.175
You're my brother, not my boss, OK?

09:59.349 --> 10:02.261
Douglas, I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you.

10:02.478 --> 10:06.687
Will you get off my back?
I'm no bartender. Get used to it.

10:06.857 --> 10:10.941
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
What makes you so special?

10:11.111 --> 10:13.067
You're playing
in a goddamn bar league.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.978
Hey, Walt, at least I'm playing.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.857
Hey. Your twenty-third letter?
Arrived today.

10:22.498 --> 10:24.204
Detroit Red Wings.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.117
It's over, little brother.
Everybody knows it but you.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.794
- Give me that.
- "Doug, sorry about the eye.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.798
- Next time you're in town, call."
- Give me that letter.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.501
- "We'll buy you a ticket."
- Give me that goddamn letter!

10:37.679 --> 10:40.637
What are you gonna do?!
You gonna fight me?

10:40.808 --> 10:42.844
Are you gonna fight the world?
Everybody?

10:43.018 --> 10:45.600
Well, put me on the list, pal.
Come on, let's go.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.525
You want something to eat,
make it yourself.

11:21.140 --> 11:22.801
All right, Kate. Enough.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.471
Lovely. Let's do it again.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.440
Do we or do we not
have eight minutes left?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.320
Enough for today.

11:40.450 --> 11:44.284
Perhaps you are wanting
to take shower?

11:44.454 --> 11:45.990
All right.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.914
What he needs
is a ride to the airport.

11:50.002 --> 11:52.539
I've got laundry that
can skate better than that.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.045
He lasted a month.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.384
You should've been making
her singles skater.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.468
So where do we go from here?

12:11.440 --> 12:13.726
Two years, eight partners.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.438
This one too small.
That one too big. Too loud.

12:16.612 --> 12:19.274
Too much sweat. Not enough sweat.

12:20.699 --> 12:24.988
Jack, she is tremendous skater.
Everyone is saying this.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.904
Petite. Powerful. Intelligent.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.164
But always is coming the big

12:32.586 --> 12:34.076
What a bitch.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.087
- What about Spindler?
- Spindler?

12:40.344 --> 12:43.006
Spindler say before he skate with her

12:43.180 --> 12:45.592
he wear garlic from neck
and sleep with cross.

12:47.643 --> 12:50.806
Who is left?

12:51.813 --> 12:53.804
I am at bottom of barrel.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.315
Then you find another barrel.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.466
You are bigger than I think.

13:28.225 --> 13:32.434
- What?
- You are much bigger than I think.

13:32.604 --> 13:38.019
I'm spending much time watching video
of you, Mr. Douglas Dorsey.

13:38.527 --> 13:40.563
You are very exciting skater.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.820
Look, if you're a reporter, you're
a little late. The story's been done.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.572
No. I am coach.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.404
What's the deal? You goof on me,
my brother buys you a beer?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.327
What means "goof"?

13:54.418 --> 13:56.784
- Are you the Swede?
- No, I'm Russian.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.873
My name is Anton Pamchenko.

13:59.047 --> 14:02.289
From the Leafs. I can't believe it.
You got my letter.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.174
You couldn't have come at a better
time. I'm in the best shape of my life.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.678
I'm skating five, six hours a night,
speed drills, stick drills, roadwork.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.215
I am not hockey coach.

14:13.729 --> 14:16.391
- What is this?
- Maybe nothing.

14:17.441 --> 14:21.354
Here... You try.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.904
Those are figure skates, pal.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.940
Whoa! I should've held out for more.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.450
This way.

15:47.781 --> 15:51.023
- You got your own rink.
- We have ice every day.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.620
That's not Spindler.

16:05.841 --> 16:07.877
Where the hell is Spindler?

16:08.051 --> 16:10.463
- I thought you said he'd be here.
- No. You said Spindler.

16:10.679 --> 16:14.797
This is Dorsey. Mr. Douglas Dorsey.

16:14.975 --> 16:20.015
- Dorsey? Never heard of him.
- Douglas is beautiful skater.

16:22.399 --> 16:25.061
Oh. You're that hockey player.

16:27.279 --> 16:28.735
How you doing?

16:30.657 --> 16:33.364
- Nice to meet you.
- ls tryout.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.071
Is tryout.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.251
Oh, my God.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.165
What, my hand?

16:50.385 --> 16:52.000
What do you do?
Soak them in battery acid?

16:52.220 --> 16:55.553
I know they're rough, but I've never
had any complaints before.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.806
Oh, I'm terribly impressed.

16:57.976 --> 17:01.639
What is this, final stages
of Ukrainian alcohol psychosis?

17:01.813 --> 17:03.678
Who's checking out who here?

17:03.857 --> 17:06.018
I don't know how many slap shots
you've taken to the brain,

17:06.193 --> 17:09.401
but this was your audition.
And let me assure you, it's over.

17:09.613 --> 17:12.275
Snow White, I'm no figure skater.
I'm a hockey player.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.155
Then what are you doing here?

17:17.954 --> 17:19.455
Get him out of my building.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.707
- What?
- Get him out of my building.

17:25.921 --> 17:28.207
Temperamental?
I can think of another word for it.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.997
- Is that what you told him?
- It's a big secret?

17:31.176 --> 17:33.713
- Who do you think you are?
- I know exactly who I am.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.593
A guy who came
a long way for lunch.

17:35.764 --> 17:38.676
Please don't let me keep you
from the trough.

17:39.643 --> 17:42.225
I'm sorry, buddy. I wouldn't wish this
on a snake. I'm out of here.

17:43.980 --> 17:47.438
Enough.

17:47.651 --> 17:50.358
Introduction is over.
Conversation finished.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.394
Mouths closed.
Ears to be opened.

17:52.572 --> 17:56.064
Pairs means two.
You have no partner.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.575
You're skating nowhere.

17:58.745 --> 18:03.364
And where are you going?
Oh, back to Siberia?

18:03.542 --> 18:06.579
Skating on small pond
is big excitement.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.586
Believe me, Gretzky...

18:10.632 --> 18:12.964
...I am last person
who's coming to look for you.

18:17.556 --> 18:19.217
Good.

18:20.225 --> 18:21.590
We skate.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.972
You are
taking her left hand,

18:25.146 --> 18:28.274
and your right hand is at her waist.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.234
Good. The line is beautiful.

18:33.405 --> 18:37.398
Now, I am counting a beat.
You push off on four.

18:37.576 --> 18:38.907
- Katya will lead.
- Hey, hold on.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.693
What's the deal with these claws
up front here?

18:43.081 --> 18:45.413
- ls toe pick.
- Toe pick?

18:45.584 --> 18:48.121
Let me guess. It has something
to do with personal hygiene.

18:49.296 --> 18:52.459
- I wouldn't let that get in your way.
- I don't let anything get in my way.

18:55.677 --> 19:00.637
Count it off.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.798
And one and four.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.139
Good. Good. Head up.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.599
Yes. Arms up.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.729
Katya, keep in line with him.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.267
Is not race, Katya. Together. Together.

19:14.446 --> 19:18.064
- What, you shower once a week?
- Is that an invitation?

19:18.241 --> 19:19.742
Douglas, bend knees more.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.366
- Good.
- Hey. Hey!

19:22.579 --> 19:24.865
Oh, shit.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.581
Toe pick.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.921
Katya, lift arms, please.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.549
Go on. Lift arms.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.672
Douglas, please to pick her up.

19:45.310 --> 19:48.347
- Yeah?
- Yes. Pick up.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.645
OK. Enough.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.566
- We are finish.
- I told you this was ridiculous.

20:04.287 --> 20:05.788
Would you please put me down?

20:07.082 --> 20:08.538
Ah!

20:08.708 --> 20:10.244
Oh!

20:10.418 --> 20:12.204
You... You cretin!

20:12.379 --> 20:15.917
Guess that move needs some work.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.883
What a waste of good ice.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.685
Ridiculous.

20:31.815 --> 20:32.975
Stare at it long enough,

20:33.149 --> 20:35.401
you'll start to see
an Olympic gold medal in there.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.902
Jack Moseley. Sit down.
Sit down, please.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.655
Look, I've spoken with Anton.

20:43.827 --> 20:47.115
First of all, I want you to know the
simple fact that he brought you out...

20:47.330 --> 20:50.288
You should feel proud. We're talking
about probably the greatest judge

20:50.458 --> 20:52.369
of skating talent in the world.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.752
Central Soviet Army Sports Club,
Moscow Ice Ballet, the works.

20:57.132 --> 20:59.373
I saw you skate in Calgary.

20:59.551 --> 21:02.042
You were a great, great hockey player.

21:02.303 --> 21:05.340
So I don't want you to feel as though
this were a complete waste of time.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.005
It was worth a shot.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.308
- What, the eye?
- No, the eye's not a problem.

21:11.479 --> 21:12.730
Is it your daughter?

21:15.817 --> 21:16.977
Kate is Kate.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.525
She's an only child,
raised without a mother.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.152
The strain of competition.

21:22.490 --> 21:26.529
Sudden changes tend
to bring out her... color.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.615
Frankly, the idea's just
a little too bizarre for me.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.585
I believe you're
on a 10:30 flight, first class.

21:37.756 --> 21:39.667
There's a check in there
for your trouble.

21:39.841 --> 21:41.957
This is what you call
giving me a shot?

21:42.927 --> 21:46.135
I don't have time to screw around.
I can't afford to be wrong about you.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.467
We were 45 seconds away
from the gold medal.

21:48.683 --> 21:53.052
Our boy dropped the ball. That goddamn
glass box is empty for one reason:

21:53.229 --> 21:54.969
We can't find a go-to guy.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.896
Thirty-five male skaters.

21:59.068 --> 22:01.684
These boys have been doing this
for years and couldn't cut it.

22:02.113 --> 22:05.571
Wagner, no stamina.

22:05.742 --> 22:08.358
Myersohn, no rhythm.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.697
Leone, Parnes, Hudler.

22:14.375 --> 22:17.037
Not one single pressure player
in the bunch.

22:39.234 --> 22:40.394
Lucky shot.

22:56.543 --> 22:57.874
Double or nothing.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.495
You're on.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.213
Katie, there you are.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.383
Hi. I was just coming
to say goodbye.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.678
Hold that thought.
Doug is staying with us for a while.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.433
- Good talking to you, Jack.
- Doug.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.606
Catch your act tomorrow.

23:29.701 --> 23:31.942
That's the end of the line, honey.

23:34.956 --> 23:37.038
If we ’re gonna work together,
try being polite.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.123
You ’re not gonna be here long
enough to make it worth the effort.

23:39.294 --> 23:42.286
- Think I can't put up with your shit?
- I don't think you can skate.

23:43.006 --> 23:45.247
There's two things I do
really well, sweetheart.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.081
And skating's the other one.

23:47.302 --> 23:50.009
God. You really are a Neanderthal.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.261
I hate to tell you,
but I'm from Minnesota.

23:52.473 --> 23:53.804
That's south of Neanderthal.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.220
What do you do for fun,
polish your knife collection?

23:58.563 --> 24:00.975
I'm sure there's nothing I do
that you'd find exciting.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.231
I don't open beer bottles with my toes.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.642
I don't sit around and count
what's left of my teeth.

24:06.696 --> 24:09.028
Hey, I don't even enjoy
a good tractor pull.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.940
Limited existence,
but I've gotten used to it.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.700
Life of the party.
Place must be crawling with guys.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.987
As a matter of fact,
I do have a boyfriend.

24:17.165 --> 24:19.747
A rough gig. You keep him
chained up in the basement?

24:21.252 --> 24:24.085
Hale, at the moment, is working
in my father's London office.

24:24.255 --> 24:26.587
He's an MBA. Han/ard.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.836
You might've heard of it.
They do have a hockey team.

24:30.011 --> 24:34.300
- He must be a very smart guy.
- First position.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.510
Bet you look good
from a few thousand miles away.

24:37.769 --> 24:39.350
OK, Douglas.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.227
Come. Shoulders back.

24:42.398 --> 24:45.014
Good, good. Now, chest out. Yes.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.099
Shoulders back. Head higher.

24:48.071 --> 24:52.531
When we're through, can we teach it
how to breathe with its mouth closed?

24:55.787 --> 24:58.494
Don't quit your day job.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.165
Man and woman
together make flower.

25:03.378 --> 25:05.494
Douglas, you are stem.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.328
Katya, you are petal.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.675
Together, we make flower.

25:10.343 --> 25:14.177
Toe pick.

25:22.730 --> 25:25.642
Toe pick.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.027
Toe pick.

25:45.503 --> 25:50.543
Toe pick.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.236
Whoa!

26:14.407 --> 26:15.943
Dorsey back to Gretzky,
over to Esposito.

26:16.117 --> 26:17.823
LaFontaine to Dorsey.
Dorsey to Gretzky.

26:17.994 --> 26:20.451
Gretzky to Dorsey.
Dorsey shoots. He scores!

26:20.621 --> 26:22.361
Yes!

26:32.633 --> 26:34.419
If you're so bored, why don't you read?

26:34.635 --> 26:35.590
You mean a book?

26:35.762 --> 26:38.174
It is a traditionally
accepted format, yes.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.805
Is this the beginning
of a conversation here?

26:44.228 --> 26:46.970
Yes. Doug can read.

26:47.148 --> 26:49.013
What was the last book you read?

26:51.444 --> 26:52.604
You were in college.

26:52.779 --> 26:55.395
Last thing I read was a letter
canceling my scholarship

26:55.573 --> 26:57.154
when I couldn't play anymore.

26:57.325 --> 26:59.611
- OK. High school.
- I was a hockey player.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.492
The only thing I had to read
was a scoreboard.

27:01.704 --> 27:05.037
- And they graduated you?
- They revered me. I was a god.

27:05.208 --> 27:07.915
What a tragic commentary
on our times.

27:08.086 --> 27:10.577
State championships, my last game,

27:10.755 --> 27:13.792
300 people carried me
around their shoulders on the ice.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.628
It took the state police
two hours to break it up.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.966
What were you planning on doing
when your gladiating days were over?

27:20.181 --> 27:24.140
You can bet your tights I never thought
I'd be working a freak show like this.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.177
I'm surprised you don't chuck it all
and start your own think tank.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.390
So where'd you matriculate from?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.855
You were in college?

27:41.327 --> 27:42.692
I had tutors.

27:45.665 --> 27:46.996
Excellent tutors.

27:51.712 --> 27:54.875
Would you please find someplace
else to put your clubs?

27:57.009 --> 27:58.920
Man, would I love
to see you play hockey.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.636
Any day-

28:10.606 --> 28:12.517
You can do better than that. Come on.

28:22.952 --> 28:25.443
- Come on.
- Oh!

28:40.261 --> 28:41.717
That's one.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.264
Come on, take it. Take it.

28:50.605 --> 28:52.095
Cut it out.

29:04.327 --> 29:05.442
That's two.

29:09.707 --> 29:11.208
Stop it, you...

29:13.920 --> 29:15.251
Three.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.163
Four.

29:24.972 --> 29:26.508
You make me ill.

29:57.046 --> 29:59.162
It's not like his nose was perfect.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.168
He's the one who wanted to play.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.385
He's like those morons who go around
insisting you hit them in the stomach

30:06.555 --> 30:08.261
as hard as you can.

30:10.351 --> 30:14.811
I don't know why I'm explaining this to
you. All I did was play his stupid game.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.518
Next you'll be telling me
how guilty I sound.

30:17.733 --> 30:21.317
- Is not guilt.
- Well, at least we agree on that.

30:21.487 --> 30:25.526
- Is fear.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.361
What do I have to be afraid of?

30:27.576 --> 30:30.409
Because finally you have
found yourself a partner.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.662
Oh, my God. I thought you
said it was just his nose.

30:42.133 --> 30:45.000
- What? What's wrong?
- He's all yours.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.932
Toe pick.

31:02.278 --> 31:03.734
Oh!

31:03.904 --> 31:07.943
- What's her problem?
- I think she is nervous about rematch.

31:08.117 --> 31:09.698
Hm...

32:14.392 --> 32:15.427
Kate.

32:18.729 --> 32:20.390
Mm-hm?

32:47.341 --> 32:49.002
You want my hands where?

32:53.347 --> 32:54.553
You gotta be kidding.

32:57.726 --> 32:59.933
- How am I doing?
- Maybe in about five years

33:00.104 --> 33:01.844
you'll get it up to half-speed.

33:03.232 --> 33:04.472
Hey.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.016
Hey, come on!

33:07.236 --> 33:09.022
Douglas?
Douglas, come back.

33:09.238 --> 33:11.194
You have the mentality
of a rock, you know that?

34:30.319 --> 34:31.775
Yes.

34:42.206 --> 34:44.413
Yes. Yes. Yes. Ah!

34:44.625 --> 34:47.958
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

34:51.465 --> 34:53.456
She's got everything.

34:53.634 --> 34:55.625
A house, the rink.

34:55.803 --> 34:57.213
I don't get it.

34:59.598 --> 35:02.590
You know something?
I don't even think she likes to skate.

35:02.810 --> 35:06.598
You worked in factory.
You were happy there?

35:06.772 --> 35:10.230
Hey, I worked there because I had to.

35:10.401 --> 35:12.187
Uh-huh.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.297
Just a moment, please.

35:44.435 --> 35:46.972
- Kate. Oh, you're...
- What the hell are you doing?

35:47.187 --> 35:49.564
- Did I say come in? Get out!
- No.

35:49.732 --> 35:52.644
Get out. Get out this second.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.355
I handle this stuff all the time.
It's not that big a mystery.

36:02.745 --> 36:04.360
- What's that?
- Open it up.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.946
Go on. I wrapped it myself.

36:09.543 --> 36:11.909
I looked in all the stores. What do you
get for the girl who has everything?

36:15.966 --> 36:17.251
An old shirt.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.336
An old shirt?
Bobby Hull wore that sweater.

36:22.556 --> 36:25.673
That's Bobby Hull's game sweater.
That...

36:25.851 --> 36:30.220
I've had that 15 years. Bobby Hull.

36:30.230 --> 36:32.846
- Forget it. I'll take it...
- No, no. I like it.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.561
- I'll get something else.
- No, I like it.

36:34.735 --> 36:36.441
- You'll tear it!
- Then let go!

36:41.492 --> 36:42.732
Thank you.

36:44.453 --> 36:46.535
So anyway, merry Christmas.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.411
Well, wait a minute.

36:58.842 --> 37:00.218
Merry Christmas.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.066
Great Expectations.

37:22.241 --> 37:25.825
Well, it was either that or
Curious George Plays Hockey.

37:28.539 --> 37:29.904
I took a chance.

37:32.668 --> 37:35.000
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

38:28.182 --> 38:30.798
- Hale?
- Kate.

38:31.018 --> 38:34.681
I was looking at your stuff.
Great pictures in here.

38:34.855 --> 38:38.439
That's your mom, right?
Boy, she was a knockout.

38:38.609 --> 38:42.352
Yes, she was very pretty.
She was a show skater.

38:42.529 --> 38:45.441
There's one over here.
You look too young to walk yet.

38:45.616 --> 38:47.152
You got skates on.

38:47.910 --> 38:50.242
What is this expression on your face?
Is that a smile?

38:50.412 --> 38:52.653
I never knew you had so many teeth.

38:53.415 --> 38:55.531
We usually keep this door
closed during a party.

38:55.709 --> 38:57.324
Am I some guy off the street?

38:57.544 --> 39:01.583
You probably didn't recognize me
in my rig here. It's pretty sharp, huh?

39:01.757 --> 39:02.963
$69.95.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.341
Turn around.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.173
- What are you doing?
- Turn around.

39:16.063 --> 39:19.396
Thank you.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.026
- Done?
- Yes.

39:27.324 --> 39:29.406
That book you gave me,
it's pretty good.

39:29.618 --> 39:32.360
Really? Using it as a doorstop
or a coaster?

39:32.538 --> 39:34.153
Very funny. Here.

39:34.331 --> 39:36.788
- No, I don't drink.
- It's only champagne.

39:36.959 --> 39:40.122
- I've never had a drink in my life.
- You're kidding.

39:40.295 --> 39:43.628
- You afraid you're gonna get fat?
- I hardly expect you to understand.

39:43.799 --> 39:44.834
- Kate.
- Hale.

39:45.008 --> 39:46.544
There you are.

39:46.718 --> 39:50.552
- Doug Dorsey, Hale Forrest.
- Well... finally.

39:51.598 --> 39:52.587
The secret weapon.

39:54.142 --> 39:55.097
In the flesh.

39:58.480 --> 40:02.018
- I guess this calls for a toast.
- Let's drink to the little people.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.776
I understand you were
at Minnesota State.

40:06.989 --> 40:08.229
For a while.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.443
I used to play
a little hockey myself. For fun.

40:12.995 --> 40:16.613
Sure. And maybe you
can stop by the office.

40:16.832 --> 40:19.244
- Help me with currency arbitrage.
- If you will excuse me,

40:19.459 --> 40:22.166
naked male insecurity
really leaves me cold.

40:26.466 --> 40:28.457
Must be tough to stay away.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.887
I understand you're
giving Kate a rough time.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.430
You know Kate.

40:33.932 --> 40:37.424
Yes, I do. And I don't like
to see her upset.

40:39.563 --> 40:42.521
If I was you, I'd invest in blindfolds.

41:08.675 --> 41:12.133
Seven, six, five,

41:12.304 --> 41:16.092
four, three, two, one.

41:16.266 --> 41:17.881
Happy New Year!

41:18.060 --> 41:19.425
Happy New Year!

41:28.236 --> 41:29.737
Happy New Year!

41:32.866 --> 41:33.855
Happy New Year!

41:36.244 --> 41:37.859
Happy New Year, sweetheart.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.411
Happy New Year!

42:22.791 --> 42:25.282
- Who is it?
- It's me, Kate.

42:41.184 --> 42:44.017
I spoke to Anton. He said you
were leaving for the weekend.

42:44.187 --> 42:46.678
- What, that's a problem?
- No, I think it's great.

42:46.857 --> 42:48.768
You haven't been home
since you got here.

42:48.942 --> 42:51.604
They probably think we've got you
under lock and key.

42:52.821 --> 42:55.107
- Come on in.
- I haven't been up here in a while.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.609
Not since Brian.
Brian had mirrors up all over.

42:57.826 --> 42:59.441
Yeah, I took them down.

42:59.619 --> 43:02.907
It's kind of a mess.
I wasn't expecting any company.

43:04.833 --> 43:06.243
What's this?

43:07.127 --> 43:08.367
That's me smelling the ice.

43:08.545 --> 43:10.752
I told this guy once
I loved how ice smelled.

43:10.922 --> 43:13.880
It became this thing.
Somebody got a camera.

43:14.051 --> 43:16.042
- I never thought about it.
- I'm not surprised.

43:16.219 --> 43:17.720
What's that supposed to mean?

43:17.888 --> 43:18.923
Kate.

43:19.097 --> 43:22.134
I'll be right there.
What did you mean by that?

43:22.309 --> 43:26.473
I think you'd skate even better
if you'd let yourself enjoy it a little.

43:26.646 --> 43:30.355
Wait. What's this? I come up to say,
"Have a nice weekend,"

43:30.525 --> 43:32.311
and you're gonna give me pointers?

43:32.527 --> 43:33.983
- You brought it up.
- No, I didn't.

43:34.196 --> 43:35.481
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

43:35.697 --> 43:37.278
- Yes, you did.
- No...

43:42.954 --> 43:44.660
I came to give you this.

43:44.831 --> 43:47.664
- What's that?
- It's our greatest hits.

43:49.002 --> 43:51.835
It's a video for your family
of us skating.

43:53.173 --> 43:55.664
- Thanks.
- My dad booked some extra rooms

43:55.842 --> 43:58.299
in Chicago, and we'd love them
to stay with us.

43:58.470 --> 44:01.633
- My family?
- Yes. To the Nationals.

44:01.848 --> 44:04.965
- They're coming, aren't they?
- I don't know.

44:05.685 --> 44:08.643
Look at all you've done.
They must be really excited.

44:08.647 --> 44:10.262
Honey, it's a 7:30 show.

44:10.440 --> 44:12.351
- You better go.
- Why wouldn't they come?

44:12.567 --> 44:14.683
They'll come, they're coming.
Hale's waiting.

44:14.861 --> 44:16.192
How do you know
if you haven't told them?

44:16.404 --> 44:17.814
- I'm gonna tell them.
- When?

44:18.573 --> 44:20.529
- Now. This weekend.
- You sure?

44:20.700 --> 44:22.565
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Really?

44:22.744 --> 44:25.656
Kate, believe me.
I'm dying to tell them.

44:55.277 --> 44:57.734
Dougie? Dougie!

44:59.281 --> 45:00.236
What?

45:01.658 --> 45:03.319
Doug. Hey, you're a captain now.

45:10.041 --> 45:11.076
Come on, come on.

45:11.251 --> 45:13.708
Hey, would you let him up
for air, dear. Come on.

45:15.088 --> 45:17.670
I'll be a son of a bitch.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.715
Man, it's good to see you.

45:24.890 --> 45:26.596
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

45:26.766 --> 45:29.599
Hey! My brother Doug,
home from the Merchant Marine.

45:31.188 --> 45:32.428
Did you forget
how to use the phone?

45:32.647 --> 45:34.933
Come on. Move back, move back.

45:35.108 --> 45:36.769
He's been cruising all over the world

45:36.943 --> 45:39.104
and he can't even get to the bar.
Come on.

45:39.321 --> 45:43.234
Hey, Ensign Dorsey. No, no...
Lieutenant, Captain Dorsey, huh?

45:43.408 --> 45:47.492
- Cool it with the Merchant Marine.
- What? Sh, sh!

45:47.662 --> 45:50.324
- What?
- I didn't join the Merchant Marine.

45:51.291 --> 45:53.031
- Still got your sea legs?
- Sh!

45:53.210 --> 45:56.623
If you weren't with the
Merchant Marine, where were you?

45:56.796 --> 45:59.412
Let's go outside
and talk about this.

45:59.633 --> 46:03.091
- We're all family here.
- Tell us about it.

46:03.303 --> 46:04.884
Come on. Tell me now.

46:06.431 --> 46:07.762
Come on, chief.

46:07.974 --> 46:12.013
Well, actually,
it's kind of interesting.

46:13.647 --> 46:14.807
Tell him.

46:21.154 --> 46:22.655
I've been doing a little...

46:24.199 --> 46:26.531
Been doing a little figure skating.

46:26.701 --> 46:28.487
- Damn.
- What'd he say?

46:29.871 --> 46:31.156
You been doing what?

46:32.165 --> 46:33.245
Finger painting?

46:37.003 --> 46:39.460
These people, they think
we can go all the way.

46:39.631 --> 46:41.087
All the way to where?

46:43.009 --> 46:46.046
To the Nationals. Walter, the cham...

46:47.180 --> 46:48.761
You just don't understand.

46:49.599 --> 46:51.135
Was it me? Was it something I did?

46:51.351 --> 46:53.137
I'm telling you, I'm good.

46:53.353 --> 46:57.596
Come on, Doug, you're a hockey player.
How good can you be?

46:57.774 --> 47:00.481
Face it. If you're lucky,
a year from now

47:00.652 --> 47:04.065
you're gonna be in a Snoopy costume
in the frigging Ice Capades.

47:04.239 --> 47:07.026
You know me better than that. You think
I'd spend 15 hours a day, every day,

47:07.242 --> 47:09.608
to win some consolation prize?

47:09.786 --> 47:12.744
- I'm talking an Olympic gold medal.
- It's the girl.

47:12.914 --> 47:14.825
You're mixed up with this broad.
That's it, isn't it?

47:15.041 --> 47:18.158
- It's a great opportunity.
- It's figure skating.

47:18.336 --> 47:20.827
And I like it!

47:21.006 --> 47:24.590
It's a lot goddamn harder than
playing hockey, I can tell you that.

47:24.759 --> 47:27.216
And the stuff we're doing,
it's gonna be different.

47:27.387 --> 47:31.300
The costumes, the music.
Everything is gonna be different.

47:31.474 --> 47:33.214
You'll see.

47:38.064 --> 47:40.180
Are they gonna make you
shave your legs?

47:40.358 --> 47:42.019
Screw this. I don't even know why...

47:46.406 --> 47:47.395
Gotcha.

47:48.783 --> 47:49.943
Ah!

47:50.118 --> 47:53.155
Good. This is looking good. Now.

47:54.539 --> 47:57.872
- Oh, I like it.
- It's not too low, is it?

47:58.043 --> 48:01.035
Well, we don't want him to hide
his light under a basket, do we?

48:01.254 --> 48:05.293
Now, where to put this? Here. Here.

48:06.384 --> 48:09.217
I know.

48:13.266 --> 48:14.847
Let's put it here.

48:15.518 --> 48:18.225
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just getting started.

48:29.074 --> 48:30.109
This is Mozart.

48:31.368 --> 48:34.826
- It's not us.
- The deal was that we had to listen.

48:36.247 --> 48:38.238
Kate, this is tired.

48:38.458 --> 48:41.245
Ten thousand other skaters will be
cueing up the same boring crap.

48:41.461 --> 48:45.249
This doesn't get it done.
It's like the costumes.

48:45.423 --> 48:47.414
Let's be different.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.423
Let's kick a little ass.

48:50.095 --> 48:52.086
If you wanna see some asses kicked,

48:52.305 --> 48:54.921
why don't you throw on some jeans
and skate to this.

48:57.143 --> 48:59.555
If you wanna win, you play it straight.

48:59.729 --> 49:01.811
This is boring.

49:06.528 --> 49:09.861
Unacceptable!

49:13.034 --> 49:15.446
- Would you stop?
- Didn't work for you last time!

49:15.620 --> 49:16.985
What?

49:17.163 --> 49:19.154
You heard me!

49:19.332 --> 49:22.824
- You have some nerve!
- Just listen to my music one second!

49:23.002 --> 49:24.958
Stop turning it!

49:25.130 --> 49:27.121
Guys.

49:28.007 --> 49:29.622
Hey!

49:32.762 --> 49:34.627
It's after midnight.

49:34.848 --> 49:36.429
I have a 6:30 appointment.

49:36.599 --> 49:38.339
We were just wrapping up.

49:40.937 --> 49:43.553
Play him the Mozart.
You'll be asleep in no time.

49:49.737 --> 49:54.106
Katya, please try to understand.
Douglas is not boy. He is man.

49:54.284 --> 49:57.196
- Is young, vigorous man.
- I don't care what you call him.

49:57.412 --> 50:00.154
He has three months to qualily for the
Nationals. He needs every minute.

50:00.331 --> 50:03.198
Sure, sure. This I know.
And he is back on Monday.

50:03.376 --> 50:06.493
- And he will be working much better.
- Really?

50:09.174 --> 50:11.165
Katya, please, you know.

50:11.384 --> 50:14.547
Solitude is...
Too much is not good, eh?

50:14.721 --> 50:17.178
It's Christmas, we skate.
I have the flu, we skate.

50:17.390 --> 50:19.506
I have a boyfriend in London
that I never see.

50:19.726 --> 50:23.310
I skate every day so that you can play
Dr. Frankenstein with this guy.

50:23.480 --> 50:25.937
I show up every morning
for seven months

50:26.107 --> 50:29.770
so that you can give him two days
to go off whoring in New York City?

50:29.944 --> 50:32.230
Is not entirely correct.

50:33.823 --> 50:35.063
He went to Boston.

51:40.473 --> 51:41.428
If I get her any higher,

51:41.599 --> 51:44.432
they'll need a putty knife to scrape
her off the ceiling. Am I right?

51:45.728 --> 51:47.810
- Are we ready for Nationals or what?
- We will be.

51:47.981 --> 51:51.599
- Celebrating? We haven't won.
- To you, Doug.

51:51.776 --> 51:55.564
Who's ready to order? I think
I'll start with some vichyssoise.

51:55.738 --> 51:59.322
Five weeks to go. Everything's starting
to click. We're gonna kick some tail.

51:59.534 --> 52:01.741
- Am I right?
- "Tail"? Excuse me?

52:01.911 --> 52:03.447
- Some beluga.
- I'm eligible.

52:03.621 --> 52:04.997
Doug Dorsey, licensed to thrill.

52:05.206 --> 52:06.946
Slow down, champ.
We've got a long way to go.

52:07.166 --> 52:09.828
- Trying to rain on my parade?
- Don't let her beat you down.

52:10.003 --> 52:12.085
Hasn't happened by now,
he's in the clear.

52:12.255 --> 52:14.667
You're standing there doing nothing.
Get our menu.

52:14.841 --> 52:18.459
- Now is not the time.
- Any specials or what?

52:18.636 --> 52:20.137
Everyone's in such a great mood.

52:20.305 --> 52:23.297
- I'll throw another log on the fire.
- Hale, now is not the time.

52:23.516 --> 52:26.599
They'll find out sooner or later.
The fact is

52:26.769 --> 52:29.852
I've asked Kate to marry me,
and she's accepted.

52:31.733 --> 52:34.145
- Fantastic.
- Oh, Hale, congratulations.

52:34.319 --> 52:35.855
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

52:36.070 --> 52:40.109
- That's great.
- Katya, I want my kiss.

52:40.283 --> 52:42.365
- Show them the ring, Kate.
- That's just great.

52:42.535 --> 52:44.901
Now, there's a piece of ice.

52:45.079 --> 52:47.661
Hale, I think I'm paying
you altogether too much.

52:47.832 --> 52:49.743
- What are you doing?
- We ready to order?

52:49.917 --> 52:51.623
- Yeah.
- Sure.

53:52.855 --> 53:54.686
Still dropping that shoulder.

53:57.568 --> 53:58.944
I thought you'd retired.

54:00.905 --> 54:02.520
I changed my mind.

54:04.784 --> 54:08.572
You know what I think
is the saddest thing about sports?

54:09.997 --> 54:11.828
People who stay too long
at the party.

54:13.167 --> 54:16.375
- What are you doing here, Rick?
- I'd like to see you go out a champion.

54:16.546 --> 54:18.411
That's my plan.

54:19.799 --> 54:22.757
If you wanted to skate so badly,
why didn't you come to me?

54:22.969 --> 54:25.756
- I know we've made some mistakes.
- Mistakes?

54:25.972 --> 54:28.759
You spent the last ten years
tying me into knots.

54:28.933 --> 54:30.434
You were always difficult.

54:33.146 --> 54:35.478
You know what the first thing
you said to me was?

54:35.648 --> 54:38.264
I was nine years old,
and you came into my building.

54:38.443 --> 54:39.558
And I was skating.

54:39.736 --> 54:42.648
And when I was finished,
I turned around,

54:42.822 --> 54:45.279
and, oh, my God, there was Rick Tuttle.

54:45.450 --> 54:47.190
And you know what you said?

54:48.035 --> 54:50.196
You said, "Boy, do we have
our work cut out for us."

54:51.414 --> 54:54.281
Still blaming Calgary on Brian?

54:54.500 --> 54:57.458
You meant a lotto this sport, Kate.
You still do.

54:58.796 --> 55:01.913
But Nationals?
I mean, now, after all this time?

55:03.092 --> 55:06.129
Ijust hate to see you... humiliated.

55:06.304 --> 55:10.047
- Humiliated?
- Oh, come on. This guy.

55:10.224 --> 55:13.091
A hockey player? Let's face it.

55:13.269 --> 55:16.181
Trusting partners
was never your strong suit.

55:17.648 --> 55:20.139
This guy, this hockey player,

55:20.318 --> 55:22.229
is the best skater
I've been on the ice with.

55:22.403 --> 55:25.065
He gonna make you cry, he's so good.

55:28.242 --> 55:29.857
You know your way out.

55:46.302 --> 55:48.258
I swear, you let me down,
it'll take them a month

55:48.429 --> 55:50.010
to count the blade marks up your back.

55:51.641 --> 55:53.677
Do me a favor, take off
the rock while we work.

55:54.811 --> 55:56.426
It's cutting the hell out of my hand.

56:04.821 --> 56:07.608
The United States
Figure Skating Association

56:07.615 --> 56:10.573
welcomes you to the National
Skating Championships in Chicago.

56:12.286 --> 56:14.663
Congratulations, and the best of luck.

56:17.250 --> 56:21.869
Douglas, free leg must be high.
Katya, head low.

56:22.088 --> 56:24.704
Yes, your body must be tight.

56:27.426 --> 56:28.836
They cry on command.

56:29.011 --> 56:33.095
Ah. The Weiderman twins. Don't get too
close. You'll go into sugar shock.

56:33.975 --> 56:37.388
- Hey, isn't that...?
- Brian Neuman.

56:37.562 --> 56:39.848
- My old partner.
- The ex-husband.

56:40.064 --> 56:42.225
Who's the new wife?

56:42.400 --> 56:45.517
Pekurovsky. Lorie Pekurovsky.

56:45.695 --> 56:47.310
Tell me how you really feel.

56:52.118 --> 56:53.403
Well, Kate.

56:54.120 --> 56:56.862
- Surprise, surprise.
- Hello, Brian.

57:03.087 --> 57:05.328
No wonder you've been
keeping him to yourself.

57:13.639 --> 57:15.755
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

57:16.267 --> 57:17.928
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.

57:18.978 --> 57:20.434
Yeah, right.

57:35.912 --> 57:37.618
Going down?

57:45.546 --> 57:47.002
You talked me into it.

57:54.597 --> 57:56.428
- Hello.
- Hey.

57:57.350 --> 57:58.965
- How you doing?
- I'm well.

57:59.810 --> 58:01.971
- See you around.
- OK. Just get in?

58:02.188 --> 58:04.304
- Yes.
- I thought you were napping.

58:04.565 --> 58:06.180
I couldn't sleep. I wasn't tired.

58:10.404 --> 58:13.692
God! He has the self control
of a rabbit.

58:13.866 --> 58:15.982
Kate, what are you looking for?

58:16.160 --> 58:17.696
Nothing. My earring.

58:17.912 --> 58:20.324
I spend four years working
my way back to Nationals

58:20.498 --> 58:22.659
and what happens?
I'm skating to weird music

58:22.875 --> 58:26.117
with a partner who can't even follow
the simplest of instructions.

58:26.295 --> 58:28.502
Maybe he's got a problem sleeping.

58:28.673 --> 58:31.961
The only problem that he has
is finding his zipper fast enough.

58:32.885 --> 58:34.341
I thought they looked good together.

58:34.512 --> 58:37.504
You think this is funny?
We have to skate tonight.

58:37.682 --> 58:39.673
- Now is the time to rest.
- Like you, huh?

58:41.185 --> 58:43.016
That's it. That is it.

58:43.896 --> 58:46.683
Call the front desk
and get a room of your own!

58:46.857 --> 58:49.564
I knew this wouldn't work out.
I can't even concentrate.

58:49.777 --> 58:51.768
I can't even find my lucky earring!

58:54.281 --> 58:55.566
Hello.

59:08.879 --> 59:10.870
This hasn't got anything
to do with skating.

59:11.048 --> 59:14.381
- What does that mean?
- You're falling for him.

59:15.928 --> 59:17.759
- What?
- Doug.

59:17.930 --> 59:20.216
- Yes.
- You are. You're falling for him.

59:20.433 --> 59:22.549
- That's crazy.
- You think so?

59:22.727 --> 59:24.558
- You're nuts.
- Am I?

59:24.770 --> 59:27.307
- You see how we act together.
- Yes, I do.

59:27.481 --> 59:29.893
We never get along.
I mean, we're always fighting.

59:31.527 --> 59:32.482
Foreplay.

59:46.333 --> 59:49.040
- OK, we're all in.
- You are not waiting for Hale?

59:49.211 --> 59:52.453
He's not coming. He had to go up
to Boston. Business problems.

59:53.507 --> 59:54.462
Is OK with you?

59:54.633 --> 59:58.546
If you wanna worry about something,
worry about ramjet the rookie here.

1:00:00.014 --> 1:00:01.220
Who?

1:00:04.643 --> 1:00:05.678
Let's go.

1:00:07.938 --> 1:00:12.102
So here we are at night number
four of the US National Championships.

1:00:12.276 --> 1:00:14.858
The country’s 12 best couples
are in the arena tonight.

1:00:15.029 --> 1:00:16.360
Only two of these couples

1:00:16.530 --> 1:00:20.148
WIll go on to the Olympics in
Albertr/il/e, France six weeks from now.

1:00:20.367 --> 1:00:23.154
Tonight we ’re seeing two and a
half minutes in the compulsory moves

1:00:23.329 --> 1:00:26.492
before tomorrow n/ght’s long program.

1:00:48.854 --> 1:00:50.936
You look nervous.

1:00:52.775 --> 1:00:54.481
You look really nervous.

1:00:57.655 --> 1:00:58.895
How nervous are you?

1:01:01.075 --> 1:01:03.066
How nervous are you?

1:01:33.357 --> 1:01:35.143
I feel better.

1:01:35.317 --> 1:01:37.524
What is wrong with you?

1:01:37.695 --> 1:01:39.811
I always get tight before a game.

1:01:40.948 --> 1:01:45.533
Put it this way. When I played hockey,
I used to have two helmets.

1:01:46.162 --> 1:01:49.029
One for the game,
and one for just before.

1:01:49.248 --> 1:01:52.490
- This just coming up now?
- Bad choice of words.

1:01:56.797 --> 1:01:59.209
Beautiful skating. Just beautiful.

1:02:06.307 --> 1:02:08.047
I don't believe this.

1:02:08.267 --> 1:02:10.098
I'm fine. No problem.

1:02:10.269 --> 1:02:12.305
Don't sweat it.

1:02:15.900 --> 1:02:17.765
- Look at me.
- Miss Moseley, Mr. Dorsey,

1:02:17.943 --> 1:02:19.774
- you're on.
- Look at my eyes, look at my eyes.

1:02:19.987 --> 1:02:22.444
That's good. OK. Now, smile.

1:02:23.490 --> 1:02:25.446
Concentrate on my forehead.

1:02:25.659 --> 1:02:28.867
OK. Now, look at me and smile.

1:02:29.038 --> 1:02:30.903
There you go. There. Bigger.

1:02:31.957 --> 1:02:33.242
OK. Now, breathe.

1:02:34.126 --> 1:02:35.286
Breathe!

1:02:37.171 --> 1:02:39.207
Just don't breathe on me, OK?

1:02:39.381 --> 1:02:40.632
Look, it goes away.

1:02:40.799 --> 1:02:45.384
The worst it was, I went out and scored
six goals in the first two periods.

1:02:45.554 --> 1:02:49.547
Next to skate,
Kate Moseley, Doug/as Dorsey.

1:02:49.725 --> 1:02:52.137
Miss Moseley, Mr. Dorsey,

1:02:52.311 --> 1:02:54.768
- please.
- You're saying once we get out there

1:02:54.980 --> 1:02:56.481
everything will be fine?

1:02:56.649 --> 1:02:59.311
It usually only took me
about ten minutes to relax.

1:03:00.152 --> 1:03:02.609
Our program is two and a half minutes.

1:03:04.281 --> 1:03:06.658
So eight minutes after
we're done, I'll be fine.

1:03:12.331 --> 1:03:15.118
So here they are, former
US champion Kate Moseley

1:03:15.334 --> 1:03:18.451
and ex-hockey star Doug Dorsey
at their first Nationals.

1:03:18.671 --> 1:03:21.128
And what a place to make
your competitive debut.

1:03:47.241 --> 1:03:50.529
Side by side double axe/s.
Here they come.

1:03:56.375 --> 1:03:59.959
And they nailed them.
They nailed them just beautiful/y.

1:04:00.129 --> 1:04:03.621
What a night for US pairs skating.
It’s extraordinary.

1:04:04.675 --> 1:04:07.382
Brian Neuman and Lorie Pekurovsky
into first place.

1:04:07.553 --> 1:04:10.340
Johnny and Jodie Weiderman skate
safe/y into the number two spot.

1:04:10.556 --> 1:04:14.390
And out of nowhere, Kate Moseley
and Doug Dorsey grab the number three.

1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:16.516
Two couples
are all the United States

1:04:16.729 --> 1:04:18.845
are allowed to send
to the Olympic Games.

1:04:19.064 --> 1:04:22.477
Tomorrow night’s long program
should be very exciting.

1:04:22.651 --> 1:04:26.815
Man, this overnight thing is brutal.
Why can't it be a double-header?

1:04:26.989 --> 1:04:29.901
Short program, long program, same night.
Boom.

1:04:30.117 --> 1:04:32.733
- We're out of here. Know what I mean?
- I know what you mean.

1:04:32.953 --> 1:04:37.037
It's like, enough already. It's like...
What's the word?

1:04:37.583 --> 1:04:41.417
- You know what word I'm looking for?
- I don't know. Expectation?

1:04:41.587 --> 1:04:43.669
- No, no. When you, uh...
- Anticipation?

1:04:43.839 --> 1:04:45.921
- Excitement?
- Foreplay.

1:04:47.301 --> 1:04:49.758
- Foreplay?
- Yeah, you know. Like foreplay.

1:04:49.928 --> 1:04:51.543
Yeah, I know what it means.

1:04:51.764 --> 1:04:54.050
Well, wouldn't you rather
just get right to it?

1:04:54.224 --> 1:04:57.716
- What?
- Skating. Long program.

1:04:59.271 --> 1:05:01.182
Chicago. Nationals.

1:05:02.316 --> 1:05:03.522
Flowers?

1:05:07.571 --> 1:05:10.062
Sleep. I'd rather sleep.

1:05:13.786 --> 1:05:15.902
Sleep?

1:05:26.298 --> 1:05:29.381
Brian Neuman
and Lorie Pekuro vsky.

1:05:29.551 --> 1:05:33.260
Beautiful skating. This assures them
a place on the Olympic team.

1:05:33.472 --> 1:05:36.930
The remaining spot will go to
one of the two teams left to skate:

1:05:37.101 --> 1:05:39.717
Moseley-Dorsey or the Weidermans.

1:05:45.150 --> 1:05:47.141
Kate Moseley and Doug Dorsey.

1:05:47.361 --> 1:05:50.649
What a performance.
Look at that sit spin.

1:05:50.823 --> 1:05:53.986
This crowd knows its seeing
history in the making.

1:05:54.159 --> 1:05:56.571
We ’re in for a major upset tonight.

1:06:16.181 --> 1:06:18.558
Oh, yes. That was great skating.

1:06:18.725 --> 1:06:20.932
Clean, powerful,
and the crowd just loved it.

1:06:21.103 --> 1:06:23.845
- Fantastic.
- Are those for me?

1:06:24.022 --> 1:06:25.523
Hey. You were great.

1:06:27.693 --> 1:06:31.606
- 5. 4, 5. 4, 5. 4...
- These are not great marks.

1:06:31.780 --> 1:06:34.567
- I expected much higher.
- Evidently, so did the crowd.

1:06:34.741 --> 1:06:37.323
It’s hard to explain,

1:06:37.494 --> 1:06:40.782
sometimes scores reflect
more than what's on the ice.

1:06:40.956 --> 1:06:45.871
The judges have their favorites. And
they don't include Moseley and Dorsey.

1:06:46.044 --> 1:06:50.287
The Weidermans will join Neuman
and Pekuro vsky on the Olympic team.

1:06:53.135 --> 1:06:54.671
This is horseshit!

1:06:54.887 --> 1:06:58.846
What crap are they trying to pull?
We skated our asses off out there!

1:06:59.016 --> 1:07:01.632
You call this a sport? Bullshit.

1:07:48.273 --> 1:07:52.266
Just terr/ble. She stepped
into the spin, then, I’m not sure,

1:07:52.444 --> 1:07:56.028
but it looked like she got caught
in his lederhosen.

1:07:56.198 --> 1:07:58.063
You know what this means.

1:08:01.203 --> 1:08:02.909
We are in.

1:08:04.873 --> 1:08:07.580
Yeah! Yeah! We're going to France!

1:08:07.751 --> 1:08:09.457
Par/ez-r/ous Olympics?

1:08:12.631 --> 1:08:15.122
- Sure you wanna do this?
- Whatever you're having.

1:10:02.908 --> 1:10:05.820
All right. We're here.

1:10:07.871 --> 1:10:09.202
Oh, boy.

1:10:10.916 --> 1:10:13.248
OK.

1:10:15.087 --> 1:10:17.169
Whoo! Whoa.

1:10:21.259 --> 1:10:22.385
You wanna dance?

1:10:22.552 --> 1:10:26.386
- No, I don't think so.
- Aw, Doug.

1:10:26.973 --> 1:10:28.679
Douglas, you silly thing.

1:10:28.850 --> 1:10:31.683
Please don't think.

1:10:32.938 --> 1:10:36.601
That's what I like about the way I feel.
Even if I tried to think, I couldn't.

1:10:36.817 --> 1:10:40.275
And I think too much,
and I think so long. And it's so tiring.

1:10:41.279 --> 1:10:44.112
The world is spinning
and spinning and spinning.

1:10:46.868 --> 1:10:48.153
Look.

1:10:51.665 --> 1:10:53.371
Did you ever play with magnets?

1:10:53.542 --> 1:10:56.454
You used to have to push them around
and they'd push away

1:10:56.628 --> 1:10:59.620
and you push them around the table?
All you really had to do

1:10:59.798 --> 1:11:03.336
was just flip them over, and suddenly...

1:11:11.309 --> 1:11:13.891
Don't you see? That's why
everything's been so awful.

1:11:14.062 --> 1:11:16.474
All we needed was a little flip.

1:11:16.648 --> 1:11:18.229
Kate, it's not right. What about Hale?

1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:22.313
Oh, Hale-shmale.

1:11:22.487 --> 1:11:23.442
We're through.

1:11:26.616 --> 1:11:29.232
Our engagement is off.

1:11:30.036 --> 1:11:32.698
Flip.

1:11:53.727 --> 1:11:56.685
Come on. Not tonight. Not like this.

1:11:56.855 --> 1:11:58.686
Not like what?

1:12:01.401 --> 1:12:04.518
Not like me?

1:12:04.696 --> 1:12:07.938
- Kate, you're bombed.
- What do you mean?

1:12:08.909 --> 1:12:11.992
That means that it's time
for you to go to bed.

1:12:12.162 --> 1:12:14.778
God, just what I need.
Someone else telling me what to do.

1:12:15.916 --> 1:12:19.534
In case you've missed it,
I am throwing myself at you.

1:12:19.711 --> 1:12:21.497
I am tearing off my clothes

1:12:21.671 --> 1:12:24.913
and you are giving me a rundown
on drinking dos and don'ts.

1:12:25.091 --> 1:12:27.548
- Hey. Why don't you calm...
- I get enough coaching on the ice.

1:12:27.719 --> 1:12:29.505
- Get out.
- You've got this all wrong.

1:12:29.721 --> 1:12:31.222
Do I ever.

1:12:33.350 --> 1:12:36.842
Excuse my surprise, but really,
what a disappointment.

1:12:37.896 --> 1:12:40.558
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Well, look at you.

1:12:41.942 --> 1:12:44.558
God's gift to reckless abandon

1:12:44.736 --> 1:12:47.648
revealed as nothing but a prude
in wolf's clothing.

1:12:50.283 --> 1:12:52.535
You're a lousy drunk.

1:12:52.702 --> 1:12:54.533
And you're a lousy date!

1:12:59.292 --> 1:13:00.907
It didn't have to be like this.

1:13:02.838 --> 1:13:04.203
I said get out.

1:13:49.384 --> 1:13:50.715
Hi.

1:13:51.970 --> 1:13:53.631
I watched your program.

1:13:53.805 --> 1:13:56.467
You've got a great sit spin.

1:13:59.102 --> 1:14:02.435
I thought maybe we could trade secrets.

1:14:56.826 --> 1:14:58.908
It's a little early for practice,
isn't it?

1:14:59.079 --> 1:15:01.320
I'm sorry. I must have
the wrong room.

1:15:01.498 --> 1:15:03.534
Ask her for more towels,
will you?

1:15:16.054 --> 1:15:17.169
Kate.

1:15:18.181 --> 1:15:19.842
Kate!

1:15:20.058 --> 1:15:22.014
Kate, will you wait a minute? Kate.

1:15:22.185 --> 1:15:24.767
Kate. Kate!

1:15:25.647 --> 1:15:27.433
- Kate.
- Don't. Don't even try it.

1:15:27.607 --> 1:15:28.938
Looking at you makes me sick.

1:15:29.109 --> 1:15:33.022
To think I was coming to apologize.
Lorie Pekurovsky.

1:15:33.196 --> 1:15:35.437
Were you or were you not engaged
until last night?

1:15:35.615 --> 1:15:37.947
- Hardly the point.
- You threw me out of your room.

1:15:38.118 --> 1:15:39.904
Count your blessings,
she may not have waited.

1:15:40.078 --> 1:15:42.569
- That's not how it happened.
- Spare me the details.

1:15:42.747 --> 1:15:44.999
- Where the hell do you get off?
- Me?

1:15:45.166 --> 1:15:48.704
This is my fault? From the first day,
you treated me like a hired hand.

1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:53.004
Then one night you get drunk,
I'm supposed to thank my lucky stars?

1:15:53.174 --> 1:15:55.381
I'm sorry. I don't downshift that fast.

1:15:55.552 --> 1:15:57.713
- Get out of my way.
- No problem.

1:15:58.888 --> 1:16:01.550
I've been practicing that move
for a year and a half!

1:16:07.897 --> 1:16:09.103
Blind date.

1:16:11.234 --> 1:16:12.189
So we have little problem, huh?

1:16:14.529 --> 1:16:17.271
Good. We skip little problem,

1:16:17.490 --> 1:16:20.527
and go straight line to big problem.

1:16:22.495 --> 1:16:25.703
"And what is big problem, coach?"

1:16:26.958 --> 1:16:29.199
Smilkov and Brushkin.

1:16:30.545 --> 1:16:31.910
NW ho?"

1:16:32.088 --> 1:16:35.376
Smilkov and Brushkin.

1:16:36.342 --> 1:16:38.754
Last night they win
European Championship.

1:16:39.637 --> 1:16:41.923
Perfect scores.

1:16:42.098 --> 1:16:46.307
Everybody's been blown away.
Contest is over.

1:16:46.478 --> 1:16:50.437
Smilkov and Brushkin are unbeatable.

1:16:50.607 --> 1:16:54.816
So, hello, Soviet surprise package.

1:16:54.986 --> 1:16:56.977
Goodbye, gold medal.

1:16:58.865 --> 1:17:02.983
Of course, there is a possible solution.

1:17:03.203 --> 1:17:07.446
But... it's probably too dangerous.

1:17:20.470 --> 1:17:21.676
Where did these come from?

1:17:21.846 --> 1:17:23.586
For 20 years,
I've been working on this.

1:17:23.765 --> 1:17:27.132
But you know, to have skaters,
to have situation,

1:17:27.310 --> 1:17:31.223
to have desire, is not ready until now.

1:17:31.397 --> 1:17:34.355
What is this?
Is this a bounce spin into a throw?

1:17:34.526 --> 1:17:36.187
Mm-hm.

1:17:36.361 --> 1:17:39.023
- You can't do that.
- The key to this is release.

1:17:39.239 --> 1:17:43.232
- There can be no halfway.
- No. No. It's illegal.

1:17:43.409 --> 1:17:47.493
ls gray area.

1:17:48.373 --> 1:17:52.116
Bounce spin to a throw twist.
Then I catch her?

1:17:52.293 --> 1:17:53.954
Well, sort of.

1:17:55.213 --> 1:17:56.202
We can't do this.

1:17:56.381 --> 1:17:58.667
Why not? We have all the pieces.

1:17:58.842 --> 1:18:00.924
We have five weeks.

1:18:01.386 --> 1:18:03.968
The Pamchenko Twist.

1:18:04.139 --> 1:18:07.006
- Absolutely not.
- You expect us to name it after you?

1:18:07.183 --> 1:18:08.889
No, no. ls mistake.

1:18:09.060 --> 1:18:12.143
- Is not right time.
- This is good stuff. I can do this.

1:18:12.313 --> 1:18:14.565
- What are you saying? I can't?
- Hey, if the shoe fits.

1:18:14.732 --> 1:18:17.565
Hey, listen. I have been
competing for 13 years

1:18:17.777 --> 1:18:21.315
and nobody tells me
what I can or cannot do.

1:18:26.828 --> 1:18:28.489
Don't quit your day job.

1:18:34.335 --> 1:18:35.836
OK, again.

1:18:36.004 --> 1:18:37.369
Again.

1:18:38.423 --> 1:18:40.914
Again, again. Again. Again.

1:18:44.888 --> 1:18:45.923
Katya, head up.

1:18:47.265 --> 1:18:50.723
Higher. Higher. She has to fly.

1:18:57.025 --> 1:18:59.232
- Are they gonna get it?
- Eventually.

1:19:00.570 --> 1:19:01.980
Before they kill each other?

1:19:06.326 --> 1:19:10.410
Release. Release must be total.
Is no halfway. Halfway is bullshit.

1:19:10.580 --> 1:19:12.992
You go halfway, you get hurt.

1:19:23.259 --> 1:19:25.966
Higher. Much higher.

1:19:27.430 --> 1:19:30.137
We are needing an explosion.

1:19:33.228 --> 1:19:35.264
on! on!

1:20:07.345 --> 1:20:08.425
Kate?

1:20:09.973 --> 1:20:12.589
I was just looking at
the pictures of Mother.

1:20:19.148 --> 1:20:20.684
I can hear her now:

1:20:20.858 --> 1:20:22.018
"The Olympics."

1:20:25.321 --> 1:20:26.857
It's what she always dreamed of.

1:20:29.575 --> 1:20:32.658
Look at this thing.
Just sitting here empty.

1:20:35.957 --> 1:20:37.493
We're almost there, honey.

1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:41.997
- I can taste it.
- What if it stays empty?

1:20:42.171 --> 1:20:46.130
Mm. Not this time. Go to bed.
You need your rest.

1:20:46.301 --> 1:20:47.791
I'm not tired.

1:20:47.969 --> 1:20:51.132
- Kate.
- No. What are we doing?

1:20:54.642 --> 1:20:56.303
Why am I doing this?

1:20:58.521 --> 1:21:00.227
It's what you've always wanted.

1:21:01.441 --> 1:21:02.726
Always?

1:21:06.612 --> 1:21:08.227
- Kate...
- I know.

1:21:09.824 --> 1:21:13.908
I'm going. These little pep talks
can be so exhausting.

1:22:02.377 --> 1:22:04.459
Opening ceremonies,
you enjoyed yourself?

1:22:04.629 --> 1:22:06.836
- It was great.
- Cold and great.

1:22:07.006 --> 1:22:09.998
So, Doug, what's the difference
between this and hockey?

1:22:10.968 --> 1:22:13.095
The women.

1:22:13.262 --> 1:22:15.173
What's the feeling?
Everybody out for themselves

1:22:15.348 --> 1:22:17.760
or is there a team spirit building?

1:22:18.810 --> 1:22:21.426
- Oh, we're definitely a team.
- Definitely.

1:22:22.313 --> 1:22:24.019
There's a real sense of togetherness.

1:22:24.190 --> 1:22:26.681
- Spirit.
- Spirit.

1:22:26.859 --> 1:22:29.692
Family. It's sort of...

1:22:30.321 --> 1:22:32.107
It's almost...

1:22:32.281 --> 1:22:34.146
- It's almost...
- Orgasmic.

1:22:35.118 --> 1:22:36.403
What did she say?

1:22:37.662 --> 1:22:40.119
- The Russians.
- The Russians.

1:22:40.289 --> 1:22:41.244
Nikolai?

1:22:42.417 --> 1:22:43.953
- Nikolai?
- Can we get a photo?

1:22:44.168 --> 1:22:45.453
You guys gonna be here a while?

1:23:11.320 --> 1:23:12.776
You forgot a button.

1:23:12.947 --> 1:23:14.403
No, I like it open.

1:23:16.534 --> 1:23:18.195
Well, it looks terrible.

1:23:18.411 --> 1:23:19.947
It pulls at my neck.

1:23:22.915 --> 1:23:24.451
You should've
mentioned that in Chicago.

1:23:24.625 --> 1:23:27.002
Enough.

1:23:35.052 --> 1:23:36.258
Button it.

1:23:37.221 --> 1:23:41.339
- We're on.
- Good luck.

1:23:46.772 --> 1:23:50.560
Representing the United States
of A men'ca, Moseley and Dorsey.

1:23:50.735 --> 1:23:53.477
- Button the goddamn button.
- Get over it.

1:23:53.654 --> 1:23:56.111
You are an immature asshole
of the lowest order.

1:23:57.783 --> 1:24:00.399
If it was 40 below and that button
meant the difference

1:24:00.620 --> 1:24:04.533
between a long satisfying life
and a horrible death from hypothermia,

1:24:04.707 --> 1:24:07.198
I still wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

1:24:08.044 --> 1:24:09.204
Skate.

1:24:34.779 --> 1:24:36.110
A technical/y superior program,

1:24:36.322 --> 1:24:38.563
but did you feel there
was something missing?

1:24:38.741 --> 1:24:41.858
Absolute/y. They delivered all
the short program required moves,

1:24:42.036 --> 1:24:43.446
but it seemed very cold.

1:24:43.663 --> 1:24:46.530
As if we were seeing two
strangers, rather than a fluid pair.

1:24:47.750 --> 1:24:49.706
It just didn't look like
they were having fun out there.

1:24:53.548 --> 1:24:55.038
Hey, Doug.

1:24:55.216 --> 1:24:57.923
- Was the altitude a problem tonight?
- No.

1:25:00.304 --> 1:25:04.547
Long program. We've been hearing all
week about your new surprise move.

1:25:04.725 --> 1:25:06.465
- What's it called?
- The Pamchenko.

1:25:06.644 --> 1:25:09.807
- The Pamchenko. Is it named after...?
- We're not doing it.

1:25:09.981 --> 1:25:12.097
- What?
- We've taken it out of the program.

1:25:12.275 --> 1:25:15.483
- It's not ready.
- Doug?

1:25:18.489 --> 1:25:19.854
A button?

1:25:20.032 --> 1:25:22.523
- What in hell are you thinking of?
- Me?

1:25:22.702 --> 1:25:24.488
Yes, you. What the hell
is in your head?

1:25:24.704 --> 1:25:27.491
- He's making like this is my fault.
- You didn't deliver.

1:25:27.665 --> 1:25:28.996
What, you want a pat on the back?

1:25:29.166 --> 1:25:30.667
When did I become
the designated asshole?

1:25:30.835 --> 1:25:32.291
What happened? Ask the ice queen.

1:25:32.461 --> 1:25:35.669
- That'll be enough of that.
- Let me know when you're done, Jack,

1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:39.799
you can tell me why I spent five weeks
on a move she was never gonna do.

1:25:39.969 --> 1:25:42.130
- You're out of line.
- I needed the gold medal!

1:25:42.305 --> 1:25:44.512
Forget it!
We can win without the move.

1:25:44.682 --> 1:25:47.924
- Impossible.
- Where were you when this was going on?

1:25:48.102 --> 1:25:49.967
Where was I?
I was babysitting!

1:25:50.146 --> 1:25:53.013
Loud and clear, folks:
Losing gracefully does nothing for me!

1:25:53.190 --> 1:25:56.353
- Think about that in the future!
- That what you told Brian in Calgary?

1:25:59.864 --> 1:26:02.571
You can kid all you want about
what happened. I've seen the tapes.

1:26:02.742 --> 1:26:06.326
Brian was getting it done.
Ask him. He'll tell you.

1:26:07.913 --> 1:26:09.494
All right, Douglas, is enough.

1:26:09.707 --> 1:26:12.790
Today, it's about a button.
You people are all excuses.

1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:14.996
- You wanna point a finger...
- You goddamn son of a bitch.

1:26:15.171 --> 1:26:16.957
Gotta find that go-to guy.

1:26:17.131 --> 1:26:19.338
You should've started
with a go-to girl, Jack.

1:26:19.508 --> 1:26:20.543
- That cuts it!
- He's right.

1:26:20.718 --> 1:26:22.174
What?

1:26:22.845 --> 1:26:24.130
He's right. He is.

1:26:27.892 --> 1:26:29.132
All of it.

1:26:30.728 --> 1:26:32.764
We worked so hard for two years.

1:26:33.898 --> 1:26:35.638
And I just went and threw it all away.

1:26:44.659 --> 1:26:46.945
- Why did you stay with me?
- Kate, don't.

1:26:48.913 --> 1:26:52.371
Don't what? Tell the truth?

1:26:55.211 --> 1:26:56.872
We can't buy back what happened today.

1:26:58.714 --> 1:27:00.215
We can't start over.

1:27:02.093 --> 1:27:04.630
Do you think I look at myself,
at what I've become,

1:27:04.804 --> 1:27:06.419
and do you think I'm proud?

1:27:07.932 --> 1:27:12.050
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

1:27:15.147 --> 1:27:16.978
Iguess I would like
to go back to the beginning

1:27:17.149 --> 1:27:21.313
and have you say, win or lose,
I could just be your daughter.

1:27:27.034 --> 1:27:28.899
You came every day, and you skated.

1:27:31.247 --> 1:27:33.659
This must've been
like a nightmare for you.

1:27:39.797 --> 1:27:42.755
I didn't know it was
gonna end up like this.

1:27:49.890 --> 1:27:51.221
I'm sorry.

1:27:56.897 --> 1:27:59.309
I'm so sorry. For everything.

1:28:04.572 --> 1:28:06.187
Please excuse me.

1:28:17.918 --> 1:28:19.294
I'm going for a walk.

1:29:43.045 --> 1:29:45.878
Kate. What's this?

1:29:48.551 --> 1:29:52.464
I'm going over with my father.
Anton has the other car.

1:29:52.638 --> 1:29:54.219
He'll take you when you're ready to go.

1:29:54.390 --> 1:29:58.053
- No, I'm talking about the bags.
- I was gonna catch the 6:30 flight.

1:29:58.269 --> 1:30:00.885
Tonight? After we skate?

1:30:01.146 --> 1:30:04.764
The house is paid up for two weeks, so
feel free to stay as long as you like.

1:30:04.984 --> 1:30:07.521
Kate, wait. What are you saying?
If this is about yesterday...

1:30:07.695 --> 1:30:08.935
I'm retiring.

1:30:11.907 --> 1:30:12.942
What?

1:30:16.495 --> 1:30:19.032
This afternoon is my final skate.

1:30:20.457 --> 1:30:22.448
- Kate, come on...
- You'll be fine.

1:30:24.461 --> 1:30:26.918
You won't have any trouble
finding another partner.

1:30:30.467 --> 1:30:34.380
Of course, they won't have
my wonderful slap shot.

1:30:37.057 --> 1:30:38.558
I gotta go get ready.

1:31:30.486 --> 1:31:33.193
Beautiful extension.
l/ery classy.

1:31:33.364 --> 1:31:34.820
Executed very nicely.

1:31:34.990 --> 1:31:37.026
I hope they can keep it
going to the ﬁnish.

1:31:50.422 --> 1:31:53.835
Neuman and Pekuro vsky
looking well-pos/tioned for a medal.

1:31:54.051 --> 1:31:57.384
Still to skate are Smilkov-Brushkin
and Kate Moseley and Doug Dorsey.

1:32:10.651 --> 1:32:12.733
Do you know what I think
would be wonderful?

1:32:14.279 --> 1:32:18.022
If you would go out there today
and skate for these people...

1:32:19.368 --> 1:32:21.074
...the way I have seen you skate.

1:32:25.457 --> 1:32:27.243
Enjoy each other.

1:32:52.860 --> 1:32:54.771
What's the matter?

1:32:55.612 --> 1:32:57.739
- Nothing.
- Are you all right?

1:33:10.878 --> 1:33:14.370
Kate, I'm sorry. My timing,
I know it stinks, but...

1:33:15.799 --> 1:33:19.212
I just keep thinking this thing
with us... it's gonna go away.

1:33:19.386 --> 1:33:22.844
I keep thinking if I can just
keep moving and checking,

1:33:23.015 --> 1:33:24.880
I'll get clear, but...

1:33:25.726 --> 1:33:27.591
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

1:33:27.770 --> 1:33:31.479
- I don't wanna fight anymore.
- No. I mean, yeah, I don't wanna fight.

1:33:31.648 --> 1:33:33.639
- Look, we have to skate.
- This won't wait.

1:33:33.859 --> 1:33:36.145
Kate, maybe I wasn't ready. Maybe...

1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:38.902
Maybe you didn't give me much
of a chance. Maybe...

1:33:39.073 --> 1:33:41.860
I don't know. Ijust... Ijust...

1:33:42.034 --> 1:33:43.774
Nine-six. Nine-three.

1:33:46.914 --> 1:33:49.200
Kate, somewhere in the middle
of all this, I fell in love with you.

1:33:50.542 --> 1:33:53.830
You may take the ice.

1:33:55.255 --> 1:33:58.839
I'm saying I love you.
I'm saying it out loud.

1:34:11.647 --> 1:34:15.310
Don't say we're not right for each
other. We may not be right for anybody.

1:34:15.984 --> 1:34:18.441
- You have to go on.
- Will you shut up a minute!

1:34:19.863 --> 1:34:22.980
It can't be any harder to stay together
than it was to stay apart.

1:34:23.158 --> 1:34:25.114
- Thirty seconds.
- Will you wait a minute?!

1:34:27.287 --> 1:34:30.245
Kate... I need you.

1:34:33.919 --> 1:34:35.034
I need you.

1:34:47.558 --> 1:34:49.173
We're doing the Pamchenko.

1:34:49.351 --> 1:34:52.309
- What?
- Oh, you heard me.

1:34:52.479 --> 1:34:54.720
Think I'm doing this
to get a program out of you?

1:34:54.940 --> 1:34:56.396
You wanna win, don't you?

1:34:57.359 --> 1:35:00.192
No. It's no good, Kate.
It's too dangerous.

1:35:00.362 --> 1:35:02.694
Then we agreed. We're putting it in.

1:35:07.452 --> 1:35:09.033
- It's out.
- It's in.

1:35:09.037 --> 1:35:10.117
- Out.
- In.

1:35:10.289 --> 1:35:11.369
- Out.
- In.

1:35:14.042 --> 1:35:16.499
- What difference does it make?
- The difference is...

1:35:16.670 --> 1:35:18.376
...I'm in the mood
to kick a little ass.

1:37:04.319 --> 1:37:07.186
- You didn't have to.
- Yes, I did.

1:37:08.156 --> 1:37:09.692
Why?

1:37:11.576 --> 1:37:12.952
Because I love you.

1:37:15.914 --> 1:37:17.654
Just remember who said it first.
