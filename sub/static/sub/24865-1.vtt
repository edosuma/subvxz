02:38.389 --> 02:40.792
- Come here.
- No!

05:52.950 --> 05:54.818
What's this?

05:54.820 --> 05:56.656
Just an old case.

06:02.561 --> 06:03.628
<i>Take him out.</i>

06:07.665 --> 06:08.967
<i>Got him?</i>

06:12.604 --> 06:14.073
<i>Higher.</i>

06:19.811 --> 06:21.147
<i>Good.</i>

06:27.051 --> 06:30.689
- Is this Greger?
- Yes.

07:04.355 --> 07:07.590
<i>Do you work at
the sex club called The Cage?</i>

07:07.592 --> 07:10.126
<i>The Cage was shut down
after Sadowski was killed.</i>

07:10.128 --> 07:12.963
- <i>Was he there often?</i>
- <i>He lived in the building.</i>

07:12.965 --> 07:14.997
<i>He came for girls
and other things.</i>

07:14.999 --> 07:16.699
<i>You mean drugs?</i>

07:16.701 --> 07:18.367
<i>You think we worked
there for fun?</i>

07:18.369 --> 07:20.836
<i>We found Rohypnol
in Sadowski's body.</i>

07:20.838 --> 07:23.108
- <i>So?</i>
- <i>Enough to kill him.</i>

07:32.850 --> 07:35.819
I need you to come with me.

07:35.821 --> 07:37.088
Sure.

08:13.792 --> 08:17.093
No drag marks were found
on Sadowski's body.

08:17.095 --> 08:18.763
The killer must
have been strong.

08:20.765 --> 08:22.698
Sorry sir. I can't.

08:25.804 --> 08:28.874
So. We know something.

08:46.792 --> 08:47.926
Why are you still here?

08:49.360 --> 08:50.862
Your shift's over.

08:52.898 --> 08:55.064
You're up to something?

08:55.066 --> 08:58.200
Are you still following Greger?

08:58.202 --> 09:02.104
Don't forget, I fought
for you to stay.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.973
Greger wanted you
fired last year.

09:04.975 --> 09:07.679
"Tadek is Old Poland,"
he said.

09:08.946 --> 09:11.881
Shifty bastard.

09:11.883 --> 09:15.086
You find anything, I'll get
you your reputation back.

10:25.322 --> 10:27.290
It's hot.

10:27.292 --> 10:29.892
Thank you, Tadek.

10:29.894 --> 10:33.429
Promise I won't die alone.

10:33.431 --> 10:35.301
I promise.

10:36.801 --> 10:38.934
Swear on your life.

10:38.936 --> 10:40.306
Mama.

10:41.973 --> 10:43.476
I swear.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.878
My lovely boy.

11:39.096 --> 11:41.266
The last days of The Cage.

11:53.912 --> 11:56.478
How did you get this?

11:56.480 --> 12:00.983
I was the landlord. I had to empty
the club after it was shut down.

12:00.985 --> 12:02.854
They left so suddenly.

12:04.255 --> 12:07.392
Hm.

12:14.099 --> 12:16.900
Do you recall any
of the tenants' names?

12:16.902 --> 12:20.904
People came and went
all the time. A lot of artists.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.439
The owner tried
to keep the rents low.

12:23.441 --> 12:27.410
I had to fight for money every
single month. Fucking artists.

12:27.412 --> 12:31.146
- Mmm.
- Some of them became quite famous.

12:31.148 --> 12:35.184
Marta Zygadlo, Viktor
Mentlewicz, Krystof Kozlov.

12:35.186 --> 12:37.453
- The writer?
- Yes.

12:37.455 --> 12:39.188
I like his books.

12:39.190 --> 12:44.260
Not to my taste.
Too perverted.

12:44.262 --> 12:47.063
Why did you keep these?

12:47.065 --> 12:48.698
I like to look.

12:58.475 --> 12:59.979
Take the tapes.

13:04.481 --> 13:06.582
<i>Some critics talk about
your clinical neutrality.</i>

13:06.584 --> 13:07.617
<i>Yes.</i>

13:07.619 --> 13:09.618
<i>Is that deliberate?</i>

13:09.620 --> 13:13.088
<i>I don't know. I'm not
responsible for what I write.</i>

13:13.090 --> 13:18.227
<i>But as the author... the female
torture scenes, are they symbolic?</i>

13:18.229 --> 13:21.396
<i>Maybe. Maybe not.</i>

13:21.398 --> 13:24.199
<i>I think communism
did women no favors.</i>

13:24.201 --> 13:27.971
<i>We still have the sexual
sophistication of cavemen.</i>

13:27.973 --> 13:32.474
<i>So, in a sense, your writing is a
counter-commentary on feminism.</i>

13:32.476 --> 13:36.312
<i>I think my writing's shit.</i>

13:36.314 --> 13:41.650
<i>But that's very bold. Er, thank
you for being with us here today.</i>

13:41.652 --> 13:43.319
<i>Thank you for
wasting my time.</i>

13:45.056 --> 13:47.223
Are you hungry?

13:47.225 --> 13:49.360
No no. Thank you.

16:48.306 --> 16:52.440
<i>Chapter One. Marek understood
there were no rules at the sex club.</i>

16:52.442 --> 16:55.343
<i>If he wanted to beat a
naked girl, he could beat her.</i>

16:55.345 --> 16:58.647
<i>He could hang her from the ceiling.
Really nothing was too much trouble.</i>

16:58.649 --> 17:01.449
<i>As long as he didn't
kill the girls.</i>

17:01.451 --> 17:04.752
<i>He could fuck them up, but corpses
didn't look so good in makeup.</i>

17:04.755 --> 17:07.521
Alicja. His last book.

17:07.523 --> 17:11.492
Never published.
Just to download.

17:11.494 --> 17:14.496
<i>The men who came there,
by invitation only,</i>

17:14.498 --> 17:17.934
<i>were currently grouped around the
naked girl in baying supplication.</i>

17:17.935 --> 17:21.236
- <i>One of their number...</i>
- Okay. Take it out.

17:21.238 --> 17:23.271
<i>...sodomized her.
Some of the watching men</i>

17:23.272 --> 17:25.473
<i>drank bottled beer.
A couple sucked...</i>

17:25.474 --> 17:27.876
<i>Back in the basement
of the sex club,</i>

17:27.877 --> 17:31.947
<i>Marek observed himself ogling
five girls behind The Cage,</i>

17:31.949 --> 17:34.916
<i>leashed like dogs on all fours.</i>

17:34.918 --> 17:39.655
<i>It seemed to him then that all the
sex he'd had, however depraved,</i>

17:39.657 --> 17:43.792
<i>was rendered bizarrely innocuous
by financial transaction.</i>

17:43.794 --> 17:47.797
<i>Just look into those girls' eyes;
they weren't thinking about sex.</i>

17:47.799 --> 17:51.533
<i>They were thinking about that night's
shopping or how their knees hurt.</i>

17:51.535 --> 17:56.638
<i>For what drives most humans, and most
humans are unremarkably corrupt,</i>

17:56.640 --> 18:00.876
<i>is not the need for self-expression,
but the need for money.</i>

18:00.878 --> 18:05.548
<i>If they formulate any thoughts at all,
they are driven by the grunt of greed.</i>

18:05.550 --> 18:08.984
<i>They fuck and lick and smack
without a trace of irony.</i>

18:08.986 --> 18:11.956
<i>Greed has always taken
itself very seriously.</i>

18:27.705 --> 18:29.707
Hanna!

18:35.413 --> 18:36.945
Hanna.

18:36.947 --> 18:39.682
Hi!

18:39.684 --> 18:41.916
Oi!

18:46.957 --> 18:49.695
Can I play? Okay.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.410
Hello.

19:11.416 --> 19:13.284
- Hi.
- Come here.

19:23.061 --> 19:24.396
Come on.

21:02.859 --> 21:07.463
<i>Alicja tried to struggle, but
even if someone had heard her screams,</i>

21:07.465 --> 21:10.068
<i>rape was just another
transaction here.</i>

21:11.099 --> 21:13.202
<i>A girl screaming was like
shopping mall Muzak,</i>

21:13.204 --> 21:15.937
<i>the sound of
buying and selling.</i>

21:15.939 --> 21:18.808
<i>Her hair was matted
with blood and semen,</i>

21:18.810 --> 21:24.012
<i>her feet and wrists clotted and raw from
the metal cuffs nailing her to the bed.</i>

21:24.014 --> 21:26.949
<i>Here, she had no name.
Here she was breasts...</i>

21:26.951 --> 21:29.819
Do we have to listen
to this over breakfast?

21:29.821 --> 21:33.755
<i>...anonymous as a child's doll. No
trace left of anything so human...</i>

21:33.757 --> 21:36.093
It's annoying, switch it off.

21:50.942 --> 21:55.010
<i>Why do men require their
rape victims to simulate desire?</i>

21:55.012 --> 21:59.013
<i>Isn't it enough that they're
humiliated beyond words?</i>

21:59.015 --> 22:02.117
<i>For the nuanced sadist,
pain is sufficient.</i>

22:02.119 --> 22:07.021
<i>This Marek knew, which may have accounted
for why he murdered so pedantically,</i>

22:07.023 --> 22:09.058
<i>the way his victim's
body had the markings</i>

22:09.060 --> 22:12.861
<i>of someone choked to death
in a sadomasochistic accident.</i>

22:12.863 --> 22:15.263
<i>The precise way the body
had been tied up</i>

22:15.265 --> 22:18.067
<i>using a fisherman's
knot known as the fly,</i>

22:18.069 --> 22:22.941
<i>a particularly painful knot that made
the victim look like he was skydiving.</i>

22:36.020 --> 22:37.756
Come in.

22:40.257 --> 22:42.524
I want to
reopen the case.

22:42.526 --> 22:45.661
I know who killed
Daniel Sadowski.

22:45.663 --> 22:48.062
I thought we understood.

22:48.064 --> 22:51.901
You don't investigate anymore. You
don't do anything, that's the point.

22:51.903 --> 22:55.236
You type the cases
into the database,

22:55.238 --> 22:59.074
file the papers, move on.
Keep your head down.

22:59.076 --> 23:01.175
I never asked you before.

23:01.177 --> 23:02.179
Tadek!

23:05.148 --> 23:10.919
I worked hard to save your job last year.
It wasn't easy. Just tick the boxes.

23:10.921 --> 23:12.156
I want to try.

23:17.861 --> 23:20.031
Who investigated this before?

23:23.167 --> 23:24.802
Greger.

23:27.038 --> 23:29.875
He's Chief of Police now.
Be careful.

23:36.013 --> 23:39.213
And what is your opinion
of intellectuals?

23:39.215 --> 23:42.818
Intellectuals are assholes,
because being intellectual

23:42.820 --> 23:46.588
matters more to them than being
entertaining. It's bullshit.

23:46.590 --> 23:51.292
There's only one idea
that matters. Nothing is real.

23:51.294 --> 23:55.364
We create the fact,
we create the fiction.

23:55.366 --> 23:59.237
Fact, fiction. Fact, fiction.
Fact, fiction. The end.

24:01.339 --> 24:04.072
Okay. We've time for one more.

24:04.074 --> 24:08.212
You write a lot about Truth. Can
you say what Truth means to you?

24:12.917 --> 24:15.216
Truth cannot be
separate from us.

24:15.218 --> 24:19.256
It cannot exist
independently of the human mind.

24:21.024 --> 24:25.894
Truth is strong
and it will prevail.

24:25.896 --> 24:29.000
There's nothing wrong with
that, except it isn't true.

24:30.734 --> 24:35.907
Truth is what you make it.
Reality is perception.

24:45.049 --> 24:47.316
Krystof Kozlov?

24:47.318 --> 24:48.384
Yes?

24:48.386 --> 24:49.885
Follow me, please.

24:49.887 --> 24:52.287
And who the fuck are you?

24:52.289 --> 24:53.858
Huh?!

25:34.231 --> 25:37.002
How long can you hold me
without charging me?

25:57.088 --> 25:59.288
Forty-eight hours.

25:59.290 --> 26:03.925
Correct. Can we be clear about something?
Article 30 of the Constitution?

26:03.927 --> 26:07.195
The inherent and inalienable
dignity of each citizen

26:07.197 --> 26:09.364
shall constitute a source
of freedoms and rights

26:09.366 --> 26:14.837
that all public authorities are
obliged to respect and protect.

26:14.839 --> 26:17.308
Can we be clear about that?

26:19.944 --> 26:21.909
- Yes.
- Good.

26:21.911 --> 26:25.313
I need a lawyer.
I'm allowed a lawyer.

26:25.315 --> 26:26.717
Yes.

26:29.119 --> 26:30.888
You wish to call someone?

26:32.289 --> 26:34.356
A lawyer?

26:34.358 --> 26:36.258
- Yes.
- No.

26:36.260 --> 26:37.992
You don't wish
to call someone?

26:37.994 --> 26:39.063
Do you wish to?

26:41.398 --> 26:42.998
It's up to you.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.803
You think?

26:50.407 --> 26:54.943
You've been detained in connection
with the murder of Daniel Sadowski.

26:54.945 --> 26:58.813
Jesus, you're slow.

26:58.815 --> 27:02.151
- You lived in an apartment on Richter Street.
- I did?

27:02.153 --> 27:04.286
- You were there for over a year.
- I don't remember.

27:04.288 --> 27:07.822
- You were.
- No.

27:07.824 --> 27:10.058
- I do remember.
- Huh.

27:10.060 --> 27:14.061
Old building. Stank of cum.

27:14.063 --> 27:17.331
Sex club in the basement. No?

27:17.333 --> 27:20.368
Did you ever
frequent the club?

27:20.370 --> 27:25.374
Frequent? Jesus. Frequent?
Does anybody frequent...

27:25.376 --> 27:28.109
Visit.

27:28.111 --> 27:31.749
Yeah I fucked some whores. Along with
the pigs from your Police Department.

27:37.388 --> 27:40.388
The deceased went out
with one of the hostesses.

27:40.390 --> 27:42.825
- What was her name?
- Daria Romanowska.

27:42.827 --> 27:46.060
- And you asked her about this?
- We haven't found her yet.

27:46.062 --> 27:48.530
- She'll have changed her name.
- We thought of that.

27:48.532 --> 27:50.832
You did?

27:50.834 --> 27:52.934
You never spoke to her?

27:52.936 --> 27:54.837
The whole year you
were living there?

27:54.839 --> 27:58.040
Do you speak to
your neighbors?

27:58.042 --> 28:01.042
- Yes.
- Yes. I bet you live in a little house

28:01.044 --> 28:05.547
and you wish you could have sex with your
wife but she's too old and you're too bored

28:05.549 --> 28:08.485
and what the fuck, you can always
jerk yourself off in the shower.

28:11.120 --> 28:14.188
Can you remember where you were
the night Sadowski vanished?

28:14.190 --> 28:15.456
Can you?

28:15.458 --> 28:19.096
- Answer the question.
- No.

28:22.131 --> 28:25.067
Did you know
Daniel Sadowski?

28:25.069 --> 28:27.235
- Yes.
- How?

28:27.237 --> 28:31.138
- He was a friend.
- Where did you meet?

28:31.140 --> 28:34.876
In the club.
Maybe the apartment.

28:34.878 --> 28:37.980
Blond. Big cock.

28:37.982 --> 28:40.182
How long...

28:40.184 --> 28:42.184
had you known him?

28:42.186 --> 28:44.856
A year. Maybe more.

28:46.490 --> 28:48.322
You saw each other regularly?

28:48.324 --> 28:50.494
As regularly as he'd let me.

28:51.628 --> 28:53.060
Let you?

28:53.062 --> 28:56.200
Daniel was... a busy man.

29:38.341 --> 29:43.110
<i>The body had been tied up using
a fisherman's knot known as the fly,</i>

29:43.112 --> 29:47.683
<i>a particularly painful knot that made
the victim look like he was skydiving.</i>

29:47.685 --> 29:52.386
<i>Free, at last, from
the carnal routine of living.</i>

29:52.388 --> 29:59.060
<i>Its long, littleness stopped, like his heart,
by Rohypnol, the notorious date rape drug,</i>

29:59.062 --> 30:02.431
<i>for Marek would deny his
victim even the fractional joy</i>

30:02.433 --> 30:04.532
<i>of the cold water
meeting his skin.</i>

30:05.703 --> 30:07.536
Your novel.

30:07.538 --> 30:10.105
Same victim. Same location.

30:10.107 --> 30:12.307
Same means of death.

30:12.309 --> 30:15.409
Only a police officer or the
killer could know those facts.

30:15.411 --> 30:20.315
The details of the murder were never
published. So how do you know about that?

30:20.317 --> 30:23.085
You really want me
to tell you I murdered Daniel?

30:23.087 --> 30:24.685
- Did you?
- What do you think?

30:24.687 --> 30:26.521
I think the book
is your confession.

30:26.523 --> 30:27.655
Why would I confess
to something like that?

30:27.657 --> 30:29.223
Tell me I'm wrong.

30:29.225 --> 30:30.591
You could be right.

30:30.593 --> 30:32.327
You know the truth.

30:32.329 --> 30:34.195
Truth. You really
want to go there?

30:34.197 --> 30:35.731
You kill someone,
it's a self-evident fact.

30:35.733 --> 30:37.598
Not according
to Christ's crucifixion.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.668
I've seen dead bodies.
You don't make them up.

30:40.670 --> 30:43.504
You killed Daniel Sadowski
and you made it look

30:43.506 --> 30:45.706
like a sado-masochistic
game that went wrong.

30:45.708 --> 30:47.341
Well that's what you say.

30:47.343 --> 30:50.480
No. That's what you say.

30:52.215 --> 30:55.017
- That's what I write.
- Ah.

31:18.574 --> 31:22.043
- Hello.
- I already told you everything I know.

31:22.045 --> 31:26.280
I published his first books. We
divorced many years ago. That's it.

31:26.282 --> 31:28.783
Has he tried
to contact you again?

31:28.785 --> 31:31.619
I will never speak
to Krystof again.

31:31.621 --> 31:33.725
I will never speak
about Krystof again.

32:40.123 --> 32:42.124
Did she ever talk to her
neighbor Krystof Kozlov?

32:42.126 --> 32:43.293
No.

32:47.697 --> 32:49.699
- Anything?
- Mm.

32:52.735 --> 32:54.272
Nothing here.

33:12.589 --> 33:14.759
Please move your car.

33:16.592 --> 33:18.592
Move your car, now.

33:18.594 --> 33:21.264
You have no authority to be here.

34:29.366 --> 34:31.565
You are never with us.

34:31.567 --> 34:32.666
Work's been busy.

34:32.668 --> 34:34.402
Work's always busy.

34:34.404 --> 34:37.471
I'm on an important case.
Piotr wants it solved.

34:37.473 --> 34:39.476
Piotr. Are you serious?

34:41.344 --> 34:43.811
If I land this case,
he'll give me my old job back.

34:43.813 --> 34:45.813
You're finished in a year.

34:45.815 --> 34:49.719
Not like this.
I don't want to go like this.

34:50.953 --> 34:53.556
Just don't forget who you are.

34:57.893 --> 35:01.730
<i>Marek thought
how fickle memory was.</i>

35:01.732 --> 35:04.266
<i>You murder a man,
and the moment it's done</i>

35:04.268 --> 35:06.934
<i>you're already retelling
the story to yourself,</i>

35:06.936 --> 35:09.871
<i>so that the act of killing
is not your act of killing,</i>

35:09.873 --> 35:13.842
<i>but belongs, instead,
to some fictional simulacrum</i>

35:13.844 --> 35:18.279
<i>in just the same way the men who
murdered so prosaically in Auschwitz</i>

35:18.281 --> 35:23.751
<i>made peace with what they did, transmuted
their memories like pieces of fiction,</i>

35:23.753 --> 35:26.855
<i>to the point where good
and evil lost all meaning</i>

35:26.857 --> 35:30.994
<i>and the only lights by which they steered
were what they tasted, saw, and touched.</i>

35:46.375 --> 35:49.746
- Krystof.
- Mum, it's all right.

35:52.915 --> 35:54.851
Have a seat. Please.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.822
Sir. I found this.

36:40.096 --> 36:41.663
Are they yours?

36:41.665 --> 36:42.864
They're planted.

36:42.866 --> 36:43.965
You deny
they're yours?

36:43.967 --> 36:45.900
I deny nothing.

36:45.902 --> 36:47.701
Who did they belong to?

36:47.703 --> 36:49.973
Well, you tell me,
you fascist bastard.

36:56.580 --> 36:58.712
When you're finished...

36:58.714 --> 37:00.016
then it's my turn.

37:47.163 --> 37:51.166
Your boyfriend. Mr. Kozlov.

37:51.168 --> 37:53.967
We're not together anymore.

37:53.969 --> 37:56.904
He called you yesterday.

37:56.906 --> 37:58.542
Might I ask why?

38:00.911 --> 38:02.913
To talk to Hanna.

38:04.114 --> 38:05.983
Daniel Sadowski.

38:07.884 --> 38:10.184
Do you know this name?

38:10.186 --> 38:11.721
No.

38:13.123 --> 38:15.592
Did Mr. Kozlov ever give
you reason to fear him?

38:18.895 --> 38:20.628
What do you mean?

38:20.630 --> 38:23.734
Did he frighten you?
Threaten you?

38:27.737 --> 38:29.603
No.

38:29.605 --> 38:32.639
- Sexually?
- No.

38:32.641 --> 38:34.509
He was never violent
toward you?

38:35.645 --> 38:36.880
Come on.

38:45.688 --> 38:49.791
Don't ever talk in front of
my daughter like that. Please.

38:49.793 --> 38:51.962
Who paid for your drugs?

38:55.598 --> 38:58.632
It's none of your business.

38:58.634 --> 39:00.770
What kind of work do you do?

39:02.572 --> 39:04.608
I'd like you to leave now.

39:39.676 --> 39:40.811
Sit down.

39:48.118 --> 39:49.719
Relax.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.569
- Is your name Krystof Kozlov?
- Yes.

40:09.172 --> 40:11.708
- Do you drink?
- Yes.

40:13.810 --> 40:15.545
Is it summer now?

40:17.212 --> 40:18.715
Yes.

40:21.150 --> 40:22.719
Is it summer now?

40:24.219 --> 40:25.855
No.

40:28.223 --> 40:32.192
- Have you ever been violent?
- Sometimes.

40:32.194 --> 40:33.897
- Yes or no.
- Yes.

40:36.232 --> 40:40.067
Did you strangle
Daniel Sadowski?

40:40.069 --> 40:41.571
No.

40:43.940 --> 40:45.909
- Did you torture him?
- No.

40:48.677 --> 40:50.980
Did you pay someone
to murder him?

40:53.183 --> 40:54.618
No.

41:39.763 --> 41:41.898
Did you let him have
a phone call?

41:43.266 --> 41:45.202
It is his right.

41:47.136 --> 41:49.038
Is he guilty?

41:51.141 --> 41:52.743
Yes.

41:56.279 --> 41:59.049
Greger will come after you.

42:00.250 --> 42:01.619
I know.

42:29.212 --> 42:31.148
I know it was you.

42:35.418 --> 42:37.186
You're fucked.

42:55.237 --> 42:57.471
Come.

43:10.119 --> 43:13.520
I was stripped and tied
to a metal chair.

43:13.522 --> 43:18.425
Mentally and physically humiliated
and threatened with violence.

43:18.427 --> 43:22.829
Officer Pietzek, the man
in charge of the investigation,

43:22.831 --> 43:25.800
verbally assaulted me
on numerous occasions.

43:25.802 --> 43:30.904
He threatened to beat me, and then he wanted
to throw me from the third floor window

43:30.906 --> 43:33.241
and say that
I'd committed suicide.

43:33.243 --> 43:37.244
His words were:
"Two seconds and it's done."

43:37.246 --> 43:40.114
I will be suing
the officer in question

43:40.116 --> 43:45.052
for violation of Article 30
of the Constitution. Thank you.

44:31.500 --> 44:34.437
Sir? They want
to see you upstairs.

44:39.542 --> 44:42.545
Take a seat.

44:49.252 --> 44:51.886
I'm not here to judge, Tadek.

44:51.888 --> 44:55.288
I just need to know
if what Kozlov says is true.

44:55.290 --> 44:58.192
Of course not. It's in his book.

44:58.194 --> 45:01.061
"Pawel leaned across
the table and stared at him.

45:01.063 --> 45:04.030
Do you know what the police do
with people who tell lies?

45:04.032 --> 45:07.934
We take them to that window
and we throw them out. Suicide.

45:07.936 --> 45:10.007
Two seconds and it's done."

45:11.273 --> 45:13.608
You memorized that?

45:13.610 --> 45:16.413
How many times have
you read his book?

45:18.014 --> 45:21.248
So you never used
violence against him?

45:21.250 --> 45:23.884
We all know Greger's dirty.

45:23.886 --> 45:26.587
I warned you not to compete
with him for the job.

45:26.589 --> 45:29.056
If you want to beat him,
pick your fights,

45:29.058 --> 45:33.429
check your facts, and never let
emotion cloud your judgment.

45:47.509 --> 45:51.645
Microphone.
Transmitter. Receiver.

45:51.647 --> 45:54.514
Officially you don't have this.

45:54.516 --> 45:56.384
Don't screw up.

45:56.386 --> 45:58.255
Discreet, Tadek.

47:40.056 --> 47:42.123
My parents will
bring Hanna tomorrow.

47:42.125 --> 47:44.027
I know, you told me already.

47:49.165 --> 47:51.398
- You hungry?
- No.

47:51.400 --> 47:54.638
- There's food in the kitchen.
- Later.

48:30.672 --> 48:32.440
Here.

48:32.442 --> 48:36.509
We were clear, no? You have
to stop coming here.

48:36.511 --> 48:38.478
I need to be with you.

48:38.480 --> 48:40.614
But not me.

48:40.616 --> 48:42.416
Come here.

48:42.418 --> 48:44.717
What? You want...
you want more stories?

48:44.719 --> 48:46.487
No, no, no, no.

48:46.489 --> 48:48.188
I've got a really
good one for you.

48:48.190 --> 48:49.723
Shh. That's not fair.
Come here.

48:49.725 --> 48:50.757
Just leave me alone!

48:50.759 --> 48:54.195
- Kasia. Kasia.
- Leave me alone!

48:54.197 --> 48:57.797
How can you hear
all this and do nothing?

49:00.469 --> 49:01.601
No!

49:01.603 --> 49:03.404
Shh.

49:03.406 --> 49:05.141
You promised!

49:06.409 --> 49:11.648
Stop. It will. It will stop.

49:13.449 --> 49:15.085
It will stop.

49:59.728 --> 50:03.264
<i>The war of words between Krystof
Kozlov and the Interior Ministry</i>

50:03.266 --> 50:08.201
<i>increased today with the author's impending
appeal against police brutality.</i>

50:08.203 --> 50:12.672
<i>The original investigation was headed by
the current chief of police, Adam Greger.</i>

50:12.674 --> 50:16.509
<i>Why did you shut the investigation
down in the first place?</i>

50:16.511 --> 50:18.512
<i>Insufficient evidence.</i>

50:18.514 --> 50:20.614
<i>Are the accusations true?</i>

50:20.616 --> 50:23.416
<i>I can't comment on
any individual case</i>

50:23.418 --> 50:28.556
<i>but what I can say is that our police
force is a modern police force,</i>

50:28.558 --> 50:30.690
<i>striving to protect its
citizens in an increasingly</i>

50:30.692 --> 50:33.661
<i>complex and challenging
society. Thank you.</i>

50:33.663 --> 50:37.431
<i>Mr. Kozlov asserts that the police
have fabricated their evidence against him.</i>

50:37.433 --> 50:38.799
Is it true?

50:38.801 --> 50:40.270
No.

50:41.670 --> 50:43.503
I hope so.

50:43.505 --> 50:45.241
Last time you said the same.

51:15.337 --> 51:17.640
The same car
was there yesterday.

53:04.779 --> 53:06.048
Sit.

53:10.118 --> 53:12.585
Greger wants
the case shut down.

53:12.587 --> 53:16.389
He doesn't like your
methods with Kozlov's parents.

53:16.391 --> 53:18.991
Planting the dope
was a dumb idea, Tadek.

53:18.993 --> 53:21.462
You don't play
Greger's game well.

53:21.464 --> 53:25.099
That's why he's
the chief and you're not.

53:25.101 --> 53:26.800
Don't disappoint me.

53:26.802 --> 53:30.436
You're the last honest
cop in Poland.

53:30.438 --> 53:34.141
The moment you took Greger on,
you were fucked.

53:34.143 --> 53:36.576
You're too old school.

53:36.578 --> 53:40.380
Greger's as empty
and hard as glass.

53:40.382 --> 53:42.351
You want to fuck Greger over?

53:44.753 --> 53:49.793
Officially, don't work on
this anymore. You're history.

53:51.726 --> 53:58.500
Keep the files. Work on it
remotely. I know he's guilty.

54:02.071 --> 54:04.107
Just prove it.

54:46.648 --> 54:48.585
- Adam.
- Tadek.

54:52.154 --> 54:55.592
You want to know the worst
part of my job?

54:58.027 --> 54:59.696
Envy.

55:02.864 --> 55:07.634
People see me as a chance to screw
over someone more powerful.

55:07.636 --> 55:12.840
Like those whores who drive
up to the big houses.

55:12.842 --> 55:15.541
You know the ones?

55:15.543 --> 55:21.518
Big metal gates and those beautiful
girls who drive right on through.

55:24.552 --> 55:27.757
I swear they'll do
anything for money.

55:31.560 --> 55:35.898
Always the same.
Communists, capitalists.

55:37.600 --> 55:39.735
But you get too close...

55:45.540 --> 55:48.444
No ghosts, Tadek.

55:56.217 --> 55:58.020
Stay safe.

56:42.831 --> 56:44.234
I'll go.

56:52.241 --> 56:55.141
- What are you doing here?
- Please help me.

56:55.143 --> 56:58.844
Someone's watching
our apartment.

56:58.846 --> 57:02.114
- Did you see who?
- No.

57:02.116 --> 57:04.720
Come. Come in.

57:12.261 --> 57:15.094
I'm going to drive them home.
Make sure she's safe.

57:15.096 --> 57:17.096
Who is she, Tadek?

57:17.098 --> 57:20.266
She's Kozlov's girlfriend.
He's been threatening her.

57:20.268 --> 57:22.636
You take one more step

57:22.638 --> 57:23.739
and I'm out.

57:40.322 --> 57:41.925
Come.

58:16.257 --> 58:17.891
Nobody's here.

58:17.893 --> 58:18.927
You can come.

59:04.973 --> 59:07.877
Krystof doesn't know you
were here the other night.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.427
I never feel safe.

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:58.184
Hurt me.

01:00:58.186 --> 01:00:59.489
Hurt me.

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:02.824
Hurt me.

01:01:06.194 --> 01:01:08.363
Hurt me.

01:02:04.953 --> 01:02:06.855
Victor? The door.

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:16.565
- You asked to see me?
- Yes.

01:02:42.056 --> 01:02:44.192
I killed Daniel Sadowski.

01:03:08.016 --> 01:03:10.650
I'll need you
to sign a statement.

01:03:10.652 --> 01:03:12.255
Why?

01:03:13.587 --> 01:03:16.258
You just told me you
killed Daniel Sadowski.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:22.430
I'll write it down.
You can sign it.

01:03:23.998 --> 01:03:27.302
I feel sick. I need a doctor.

01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:36.409
Sign and I'll get you
a doctor.

01:03:36.411 --> 01:03:38.043
You put something
in the water.

01:03:38.045 --> 01:03:39.314
Sign the statement!

01:03:45.386 --> 01:03:47.589
You raped her. Hmm.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.029
Let him go.

01:04:58.226 --> 01:05:03.128
Stop! Stop!

01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:04.329
Don't! Don't!

01:05:04.331 --> 01:05:08.069
Shut up! Quiet!
Quiet, bitch!

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.409
No. Don't!

01:05:18.647 --> 01:05:23.585
Say it. Say it! Say it. Say it.

01:05:25.587 --> 01:05:28.487
Hurt me. Hurt me! Hurt me!

01:06:51.206 --> 01:06:52.304
Yes?

01:06:52.306 --> 01:06:53.408
Open the door.

01:06:58.612 --> 01:07:01.713
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:07:01.715 --> 01:07:04.784
I was, er..

01:07:04.786 --> 01:07:07.656
You want..
you want some coffee?

01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:11.127
Talk.

01:07:16.397 --> 01:07:17.732
Talk.

01:07:20.402 --> 01:07:22.367
What do you want me to say?

01:07:22.369 --> 01:07:26.338
How old is Hanna? Eight?

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.875
You have an eight year old
daughter and you're a drug addict.

01:07:28.877 --> 01:07:30.944
I can have her taken away.

01:07:30.946 --> 01:07:33.913
Is that all you can do?
Threaten me?

01:07:33.915 --> 01:07:35.882
Talk to me.

01:07:35.884 --> 01:07:40.386
You know Greger. You knew
Sadowski. You fucked him.

01:07:40.388 --> 01:07:45.391
Yes, I did. I fucked him. He paid me.
I fucked him because he paid me.

01:07:45.393 --> 01:07:46.826
And Kozlov knew about it.

01:07:46.828 --> 01:07:49.295
You're the girl
in the inner room.

01:07:49.297 --> 01:07:53.668
Alicja is your story.
You talked, he wrote it down.

01:07:55.603 --> 01:07:57.971
- He loved me.
- He didn't love you.

01:07:57.973 --> 01:08:00.239
He did. He loved me.

01:08:00.241 --> 01:08:03.942
You drove him mad. He strangled a
man and dumped him in the river.

01:08:03.944 --> 01:08:09.282
You talk about Sadowski as
if he was a saint. He wasn't.

01:08:09.284 --> 01:08:10.953
He deserves justice.

01:08:12.554 --> 01:08:14.456
You want justice?

01:08:16.423 --> 01:08:20.662
You saw the marks. You saw
what they did to me every day.

01:08:22.429 --> 01:08:23.631
This is what they made me.

01:08:25.532 --> 01:08:29.203
In my head is where
they rape me. Forever.

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:37.478
Is that part of the show?
I can't tell anymore.

01:08:43.951 --> 01:08:50.323
You're going to sign a statement. You
do that, you keep the girl. Come on.

01:08:50.325 --> 01:08:51.957
Sit down.

01:08:51.959 --> 01:08:55.728
I've brought it for you.
You see?

01:08:55.729 --> 01:09:00.600
Here we go.
I even brought you a pen.

01:09:00.602 --> 01:09:04.305
We'll do it together.
Pick up the pen. Pick it up!

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:08.377
You know how to sign
your name, don't you? Do it.

01:09:37.738 --> 01:09:39.037
Let me go.

01:09:39.038 --> 01:09:41.042
I haven't done anything,
you piece of shit.

01:09:42.843 --> 01:09:44.510
Aaah!

01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:45.714
Fuck!

01:10:01.562 --> 01:10:03.598
- Kasia said that?
- Yes.

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.473
I love her.

01:10:18.012 --> 01:10:21.012
The things he did to her.

01:10:21.014 --> 01:10:24.449
How could you let him do those
things and get away with it?

01:10:24.451 --> 01:10:25.853
- Right.
- Right.

01:10:28.088 --> 01:10:30.024
And that's the story.

01:10:31.793 --> 01:10:34.929
That's the story.

01:10:43.605 --> 01:10:45.507
You think?

01:10:51.913 --> 01:10:53.816
I know.

01:12:10.892 --> 01:12:11.994
Victor.

01:12:24.539 --> 01:12:26.942
I'll get it.

01:12:30.544 --> 01:12:31.879
That's good.

01:12:51.532 --> 01:12:53.701
You know this
changes nothing.

01:12:55.136 --> 01:12:57.473
You get rid of me, who cares?

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.076
We used to get rid
of people from Solidarity.

01:13:04.078 --> 01:13:05.880
They still won.

01:13:07.581 --> 01:13:09.918
I'll tell you what this is.

01:13:11.619 --> 01:13:12.987
Envy.

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:15.854
Hmm.

01:13:15.856 --> 01:13:18.493
I've heard this story.

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:46.952
Obviously I can't comment
on any individual officer

01:13:46.954 --> 01:13:48.988
while investigations
are still pending.

01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:50.890
<i>Is it true Greger resigned?</i>

01:13:50.892 --> 01:13:53.225
<i>Mr. Greger needs time
to answer the allegations</i>

01:13:53.227 --> 01:13:55.994
<i>made against him by Kozlov
and other witnesses.</i>

01:13:55.996 --> 01:14:00.299
<i>And for the sake of the police force, to
which he has devoted his professional life,</i>

01:14:00.301 --> 01:14:02.234
<i>he has taken
the decision to step down.</i>

01:14:02.236 --> 01:14:04.135
<i>Are you
his permanent replacement?</i>

01:14:04.137 --> 01:14:07.042
<i>I'm an ex-Communist,
nothing in life is permanent.</i>

01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:22.991
You should see this. Sir.

01:15:18.111 --> 01:15:21.350
Excuse me sir,
where are you going?

01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:24.684
Sir?

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:26.885
Sir, you can't go down there.

01:15:26.887 --> 01:15:28.189
Sir?

01:15:32.727 --> 01:15:35.226
I need to talk to you.

01:15:35.228 --> 01:15:37.395
What do you want?

01:15:37.397 --> 01:15:39.931
We've charged the wrong man.

01:15:39.933 --> 01:15:42.167
Kozlov signed the confession.

01:15:42.169 --> 01:15:43.735
Koslov is mad.

01:15:43.737 --> 01:15:46.238
Did that worry you before?

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.710
Kozlov was abroad
when Sadowski was murdered.

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:52.278
He came back the day after!

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:54.081
And you didn't check it?

01:15:56.217 --> 01:15:58.717
He was a very
compelling suspect.

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:02.087
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:16:02.089 --> 01:16:04.890
If Kozlov is not guilty...

01:16:04.892 --> 01:16:09.427
You think I am going to lose everything I
worked for so you can change your mind?

01:16:09.429 --> 01:16:13.765
I don't give a shit who you paid,
who you fucked, who you lied to.

01:16:13.767 --> 01:16:16.270
This is the story now.

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:22.006
Piotr, this is not justice!

01:16:22.008 --> 01:16:26.177
Fuck justice! Were you thinking about justice
when you screwed Kozlov's girlfriend?

01:16:26.179 --> 01:16:29.014
You want me to tell
your family about that?

01:16:29.016 --> 01:16:31.850
You want me
to tell your daughter?

01:16:31.852 --> 01:16:34.987
You think that case just
landed on your desk by accident?

01:16:34.989 --> 01:16:38.424
I gave it to you,
you arrogant fuck.

01:16:38.426 --> 01:16:43.996
Victor works for me.
Oh, and I had you followed.

01:16:43.998 --> 01:16:48.501
See, people don't want justice.
They want good and evil.

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:54.239
Big, bright stories told with conviction.
That's what we do. That's what you did.

01:16:54.241 --> 01:16:59.181
You wrote the big, bright story,
told with conviction. Well done.

01:17:00.914 --> 01:17:04.082
I am the Chief of Police now.

01:17:04.084 --> 01:17:06.821
Now fuck off
out of my sunshine.

01:17:46.861 --> 01:17:49.131
When did he leave?

01:17:50.231 --> 01:17:52.334
After you were here.

01:17:55.002 --> 01:17:57.036
Any idea where he went?

01:17:57.038 --> 01:17:58.205
Hmm-mm.

01:18:01.508 --> 01:18:03.110
Are you finished?

01:18:39.146 --> 01:18:42.081
I'll be home soon.

01:18:42.083 --> 01:18:48.290
You be a good girl. I know you
will, at school, with mama. Okay?

01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:52.127
Time is over.

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:07.909
Bye.

01:19:34.067 --> 01:19:37.568
You lied.
About killing Sadowski.

01:19:37.570 --> 01:19:39.470
No.

01:19:39.472 --> 01:19:42.643
You weren't even there
when the murder happened.

01:19:44.611 --> 01:19:49.148
What makes you think
the murder even happened here?

01:19:49.150 --> 01:19:53.254
The river has an end...
and a beginning.

01:20:07.567 --> 01:20:09.103
Fuck!!!

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.951
It'll be on later tonight.

01:20:58.018 --> 01:20:59.186
Fine.

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:15.255
No. No. No. No.

01:24:28.361 --> 01:24:32.331
<i>The implications of the direction
of the euro remain to be seen.</i>

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:35.000
<i>Now, an update
on the Kozlov case.</i>

01:24:35.002 --> 01:24:37.769
<i>Missing papers given
to the press by a source</i>

01:24:37.771 --> 01:24:40.973
<i>close to the investigation
reveal that Krystof Kozlov,</i>

01:24:40.975 --> 01:24:44.576
<i>the main suspect in the
murder of Daniel Sadowski,</i>

01:24:44.578 --> 01:24:47.746
<i>was actually out of the country
on the night of his murder.</i>

01:24:47.748 --> 01:24:50.448
<i>The authorities have yet
to issue a statement,</i>

01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:54.385
<i>but Kozlov's lawyer has already
recorded a miscarriage of justice.</i>

01:24:54.387 --> 01:24:58.256
<i>The controversy surrounding the
brutal murder of Daniel Sadowski</i>

01:24:58.258 --> 01:25:01.460
<i>has taken a new turn.
Documents supplied to...</i>

01:26:33.353 --> 01:26:34.920
What do you want?

01:26:34.922 --> 01:26:37.055
Let me in. Please.

01:26:37.057 --> 01:26:38.989
I have nothing
to say to you.

01:26:38.991 --> 01:26:42.661
I did what you wanted me
to do, now leave me alone.

01:26:42.663 --> 01:26:44.932
I was wrong.
I made a mistake.

01:26:46.566 --> 01:26:50.537
And I was wrong to hurt you.
I'm sorry.

01:27:11.691 --> 01:27:13.958
Where are the others?

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.096
They'll come later.

01:27:52.932 --> 01:27:55.369
I've got to know
what Sadowski did to you.

01:28:00.907 --> 01:28:02.877
You want to hear the truth?

01:28:08.147 --> 01:28:10.717
It's all I have left.

01:28:15.588 --> 01:28:20.060
You can look into your lover's eyes all your
life and never know what they truly think.

01:28:23.129 --> 01:28:29.167
The truth is, Sadowski
was a sadist. The worst by far.

01:28:29.169 --> 01:28:34.872
Sometimes he...
he liked me to play dead,

01:28:34.874 --> 01:28:36.810
then he'd rape me.

01:28:38.611 --> 01:28:41.546
I took drugs.

01:28:41.548 --> 01:28:43.918
Enough, you know,
to just, to numb it.

01:28:46.018 --> 01:28:50.622
Sometimes Sadowski
wanted me to choke him.

01:28:50.624 --> 01:28:51.626
So I did.

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:57.863
This time I... I just...

01:28:57.865 --> 01:29:00.698
I didn't stop.

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:04.269
I just... I didn't stop.

01:29:04.271 --> 01:29:06.007
I killed him.

01:29:10.677 --> 01:29:13.781
I called Krystof
as soon as it happened.

01:29:16.549 --> 01:29:19.152
He never asked why.

01:29:20.254 --> 01:29:22.890
He just did what he had to do.

01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:32.133
That kind of love is..
is a rare thing.

01:29:37.704 --> 01:29:38.973
Truly...

01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:41.609
Truly...

01:29:43.043 --> 01:29:47.748
I do this for my daughter.
And for Krystof.

01:29:52.986 --> 01:29:56.224
This is the only...
the only family I have.

01:29:59.726 --> 01:30:03.761
And nothing is going
to get in its way.

01:30:03.763 --> 01:30:06.234
Because this is
the best I can be.

01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:12.138
I'm sorry.
