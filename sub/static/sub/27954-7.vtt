02:32.736 --> 02:34.404

02:36.406 --> 02:37.783
‐ In the second round,

02:39.368 --> 02:41.036

As far as hardenable steels

<i>the oxyacetylene torch</i>

03:19.616 --> 03:21.284

03:21.284 --> 03:23.662

the right way to go

03:23.662 --> 03:25.414
on this particular vehicle.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.124
<i>‐ I've chosen to go</i>
<i>with the leaf spring,</i>

03:27.124 --> 03:28.834
and I think that that's
a good steel to work with.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.794
It's already
a pretty good thickness.

03:30.794 --> 03:32.629
‐ There should be enough
leaf springs for everybody

03:32.629 --> 03:34.339
to use on this, right?
‐ Oh, yeah.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.800
‐ It's a tried and true metal
that in many cultures

03:36.800 --> 03:39.594
they use to make blades.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.638
‐ And our smiths
have paired off,

03:41.638 --> 03:43.640
<i>and they're using</i>
<i>the oxyacetylene torches</i>

03:43.640 --> 03:45.809

03:51.314 --> 03:53.984
‐ One thing to be wary of
is what can often happen

03:53.984 --> 03:56.153
in old leaf springs is,
through use,

03:56.153 --> 03:58.655
<i>you can get micro‐cracks</i>
<i>all in the steel.</i>

03:58.655 --> 04:01.783

minimize stress fractures?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.952
<i>‐ Lose the dirty steel.</i>
<i>Cut that off.</i>

04:03.952 --> 04:05.287
‐ Okay.
‐ Yeah.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.496
I can grab them if you want

04:06.496 --> 04:07.539

04:07.539 --> 04:09.166
You got it?

04:09.166 --> 04:11.168

the pieces off the top.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.628
<i>I actually made up a little</i>
<i>mockup of a friction folder</i>

04:13.628 --> 04:15.672

you know, not 22 inches long.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.134
All of them

‐ Pick your poison, man.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.860

05:01.009 --> 05:03.261

11 to 13 inches long.

05:03.261 --> 05:06.389

05:06.389 --> 05:08.266
how you make your handle
on the second round.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.602
<i>‐ The main thing that</i>
<i>I'm paying attention to</i>

05:10.602 --> 05:13.688

in correspondence

05:13.688 --> 05:16.900

05:16.900 --> 05:20.779
A friction folder‐‐
you have to create a flush fit,

05:20.779 --> 05:22.739
because when
you're not using it,

05:22.739 --> 05:25.242
it has to stay tight,
and when you're using it,

05:25.242 --> 05:26.576
it's got to stay open.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.621

a little pad

05:54.646 --> 05:56.773

05:56.773 --> 06:00.402
The concept is to hollow out
a little pocket

where that tab would
fit in the pocket,

06:02.445 --> 06:05.282
