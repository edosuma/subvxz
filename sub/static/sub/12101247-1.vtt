01:49.677 --> 01:54.481
Husbands, love your wife,

01:54.515 --> 01:57.518
as Christ loved the church,

01:57.552 --> 02:01.656
that he might sanctify her.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.224
Having cleansed her

02:04.257 --> 02:07.361
by the washing of the water
with the Word,

02:07.394 --> 02:12.800
that he might present the church
to himself in splendor,

02:12.834 --> 02:16.470
without spot or wrinkle

02:16.504 --> 02:19.439
or any such thing.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.944
That she might be holy

02:22.977 --> 02:27.381
and without blemish.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.917
In the same way,

02:29.951 --> 02:36.423
husbands should love their wives
as their own bodies.

02:39.259 --> 02:42.797
He who loves his wife

02:42.830 --> 02:46.801
loves himself.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.771
For no one...

02:55.475 --> 02:57.812
Thank you very much.

02:57.845 --> 02:58.846
Ah, Maggie.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.715
Beautiful sermon.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.750
Good to see you, Maggie.

03:02.784 --> 03:04.886
Alright, I'd find
the hair of dog.

03:04.919 --> 03:06.788
- Yeah.
- Great work as usual.

03:06.821 --> 03:09.222
- Nice job, brother.
- See you.

03:09.256 --> 03:12.359
- Yeah.
- Alright.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.761
Ah.

03:13.795 --> 03:15.963
It was a beautiful sermon,
Reverend Fedder.

03:15.997 --> 03:17.799
Thank you, Amelia.

03:17.832 --> 03:20.601
I hope to have a husband
who loves me like that.

03:20.635 --> 03:24.337
God will see to it,
I'm sure of it.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.774
Are you here by yourself?

03:26.808 --> 03:29.610
Your mother hasn't been
to services in a while.

03:29.644 --> 03:30.611
Is she...

03:30.645 --> 03:32.547
She started drinking again.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.750
Mm.

03:35.783 --> 03:39.486
Sometimes further initiative
is necessary.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.524
I could stop by your home
tomorrow, just talk to her.

03:43.558 --> 03:45.292
- Could you, please?
- Oh, yeah.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.327
She's been suffering
for a while now,

03:47.360 --> 03:50.297
but I'm praying
for her happiness.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.700
- I am.
- Oh.

06:08.703 --> 06:11.438
Amelia.

06:12.573 --> 06:13.975
Who's that?

06:20.681 --> 06:22.617
Amelia.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.554
Amelia.

07:11.766 --> 07:16.871
<i>Moving the body up and down.</i>

07:27.214 --> 07:29.850
Anne?

07:29.884 --> 07:31.852
Anne?

07:33.988 --> 07:35.690
Anne?

07:37.291 --> 07:40.628
What?

07:40.661 --> 07:45.566
Okay, well, thanks for...
thanks for calling.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.570
What is it?

07:51.305 --> 07:53.107
So she was walking home,

07:53.140 --> 07:55.209
and that's the last
you saw of her?

07:55.242 --> 07:57.611
Think she might have run away?

07:57.645 --> 07:59.146
Well, Jakob was gonna
go visit...

07:59.180 --> 08:02.083
I was planning to stop by
their house today.

08:02.116 --> 08:06.187
Um, Amelia was concerned about
her mother's drinking.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.556
Yeah, I saw Lucy earlier.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.758
She's definitely
back on the sauce.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.793
It's a Goddamn shame.

08:12.827 --> 08:14.996
Oh, I'm sorry about
the blasphemy.

08:15.029 --> 08:16.864
- Don't worry about it.
- That's alright.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.733
Living alone
with an alcoholic parent

08:18.766 --> 08:21.302
can be cause to skip town.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.938
I-I don't think
that Amelia would

08:23.971 --> 08:27.108
leave her mother's house
in the middle of the night.

08:27.141 --> 08:28.976
I mean, she believed
that her mother was...

08:29.010 --> 08:31.145
Amelia had faith.

08:31.178 --> 08:34.615
You two are using past tense.
Do you suspect foul play?

08:34.648 --> 08:38.119
Apologies.
Amelia <i>has</i> faith.

08:38.152 --> 08:40.755
Well, these situations can be
a nightmare for everyone,

08:40.788 --> 08:45.026
so it's easy to
assume the worst.

08:45.059 --> 08:48.863
Were you gonna say
something else, Anne?

08:48.896 --> 08:51.198
Join us in prayer, Mike?

08:55.302 --> 08:56.737
Oh, man.

08:59.273 --> 09:01.342
Mmm.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.311
It had to be the Goddamn father.

09:04.345 --> 09:06.180
How many times
do I have to tell you

09:06.213 --> 09:08.783
not to take the Lord's name
in vain?

09:08.816 --> 09:12.086
Her father died of cancer
when she was a baby, Bob.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.854
Carol's right.

09:13.888 --> 09:16.090
Lucy raised Amelia on her own.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.225
You sound just like Dad,

09:18.259 --> 09:21.062
always looking for the good
qualities in people.

09:21.095 --> 09:22.763
But guess what.

09:22.797 --> 09:24.899
9 times out of 10,
when a child goes missing,

09:24.932 --> 09:26.600
it's a relative or a boyfriend.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.903
Did she have a boyfriend?

09:28.936 --> 09:31.372
Oh, I mean, that's it, then.

09:31.405 --> 09:32.773
They probably ran off together.

09:32.807 --> 09:35.309
They're just doing
stupid kid stuff.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.612
Well, we can only hope
it's something so reckless.

09:38.646 --> 09:42.149
Sheriff Hess, he says
they've hit a dead end.

09:42.183 --> 09:44.018
Amelia wasn't like that.

09:46.921 --> 09:49.924
Her mother had problems,

09:49.957 --> 09:53.094
but Amelia was loyal to her.

09:53.127 --> 09:57.264
Good people don't just
leave their families.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.237
Oh, come on.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.306
You expect me to believe
a teenage girl

10:05.339 --> 10:08.008
doesn't have a boyfriend or two?

10:08.042 --> 10:11.278
Carol, how many boyfriends
did you have in high school?

10:11.312 --> 10:14.014
Don't shame me
because I was popular.

10:16.684 --> 10:20.087
I just don't understand
why a young girl goes missing

10:20.121 --> 10:22.256
and you're all so quick
to blame her.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.158
Nobody's blaming her, Anne.

10:24.191 --> 10:28.662
But really, what can we do
besides pray for the best?

10:28.696 --> 10:30.931
She'll turn up.

10:30.965 --> 10:33.300
Don't worry.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.500
Anne.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.181
Oh, geez, I forgot to tell you.

11:54.215 --> 11:59.987
The proposal for the gin mill
went through.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.389
Is that actually happening?

12:02.423 --> 12:04.225
Yeah.

12:04.258 --> 12:08.295
The Historical Society thinks,
whew, this new retail space

12:08.329 --> 12:13.067
will provide a lot of tourism
and jobs.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.303
Mm, while gutting our history.

12:17.938 --> 12:21.308
Well, I don't know about that.

12:21.342 --> 12:25.446
The basic foundation of the mill
won't be altered.

12:25.479 --> 12:28.516
We fought hard for that.

12:30.251 --> 12:35.122
We even hired a design firm
with some local experience.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.091
Do you remember Tom Low?

12:39.594 --> 12:41.895
Tom Low?

12:41.929 --> 12:44.098
Your old flame?

12:44.131 --> 12:47.001
Hardly call him that.

12:47.034 --> 12:50.271
I mean, we were just kids.

12:50.304 --> 12:53.374
Anyway, he is coming into town,

12:53.407 --> 12:58.345
so I'm gonna meet with him.

13:00.914 --> 13:04.451
Well, tell Tom I said hi.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.263
Tom?

13:49.296 --> 13:51.165
Are you hiding back here?

13:51.198 --> 13:54.034
I was going for mysterious.

13:55.503 --> 13:57.471
I'm not surprised.
You were two peas in a pod.

13:57.505 --> 13:59.039
True, true. We were.

13:59.073 --> 14:01.308
She is the one that labled me
Mr. Mischievous.

14:01.342 --> 14:05.913
Yeah, you... you were
uncontrollable in those days.

14:05.946 --> 14:09.083
I was. I know I was.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.986
You know, Anne...

14:13.020 --> 14:18.092
I am surprised that you
wound up marrying Jakob.

14:22.597 --> 14:24.164
I don't know how to take that.

14:24.198 --> 14:25.966
I mean, I like Jakob.
Don't get me wrong.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.401
I-I don't mean to insult you
or Jakob.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.670
That's not what I'm saying.

14:28.703 --> 14:30.938
It's just that, you,
a church mouse?

14:30.971 --> 14:32.272
I don't...

14:32.306 --> 14:33.941
I don't understand.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.943
Whatever happened to
the adventurous Anne

14:35.976 --> 14:40.013
that wanted to go travel
in exotic places and...

14:40.047 --> 14:43.016
What about moving to Cairo?

14:43.050 --> 14:46.920
- Remember that fantasy?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

14:48.222 --> 14:49.923
I don't know.

14:49.957 --> 14:53.695
You make plans for things
and then...

14:53.728 --> 14:57.164
Life happens, I guess.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.966
It was, um...

14:58.999 --> 15:02.269
I think it was around the time
that... that you left town

15:02.302 --> 15:05.973
that my mother died.

15:06.006 --> 15:10.110
And...

15:10.144 --> 15:13.581
Jakob was there for me.

15:13.615 --> 15:18.252
He offered me comfort.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.688
So did the church.

15:20.722 --> 15:23.625
They were both steady
when I needed support.

15:27.261 --> 15:30.497
Uh...

15:30.532 --> 15:32.332
Make no mistake,
we have a good life.

15:32.366 --> 15:37.104
We do. I'm... I'm... I'm happy.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.675
Yeah.

15:40.708 --> 15:44.646
To happiness.

15:44.679 --> 15:46.548
Ahh.

16:01.295 --> 16:04.431
Wow. This brings back memories.

16:07.167 --> 16:11.539
Remember when
we used to come here?

16:11.573 --> 16:14.676
How could I forget?

16:25.452 --> 16:27.689
So, what do you think?

16:27.722 --> 16:30.792
I got to be honest with you.

16:30.825 --> 16:35.630
This job has got me
flying all around the world.

16:35.663 --> 16:37.264
But when I heard about
this project,

16:37.297 --> 16:40.400
I jumped at the offer
because of you.

16:42.504 --> 16:44.672
I hope that's not the only
reason you're here.

16:46.674 --> 16:49.142
Well, it's not the only reason.

17:04.526 --> 17:06.493
Anne!

17:06.528 --> 17:07.829
What in the hell was that?

17:07.862 --> 17:09.429
I don't know.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.766
Hello?

17:20.407 --> 17:23.143
Watch your step.

17:27.549 --> 17:31.151
We'll have to air all this out.

17:31.184 --> 17:34.121
Yeah.

17:36.323 --> 17:38.392
Tom.

17:41.796 --> 17:43.731
Tom?

17:45.767 --> 17:48.135
Tom!

17:48.168 --> 17:51.471
Oh! Oh, my God. You scared me.
Don't do that.

17:53.841 --> 17:56.343
- Oh, I got you good.
- You are terrible.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.713
Ah, so I've been told.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.518
Where did those come from?

18:07.321 --> 18:09.456
- They weren't here before?
- No.

18:15.195 --> 18:18.733
They're comfy.

18:18.766 --> 18:20.535
Have a seat.

18:20.568 --> 18:22.670
I won't bite you.

18:22.704 --> 18:24.772
I'm not so sure.

18:56.604 --> 18:58.740
Ohh.

18:58.773 --> 19:03.276
You are still
so dangerously handsome.

19:05.647 --> 19:07.815
What's wrong, Anne?

19:10.718 --> 19:12.587
This is so tempting.

19:12.620 --> 19:16.423
I just can't do it to Jakob.

19:20.561 --> 19:23.263
Are you sure?

19:26.567 --> 19:28.670
Yes, Tommy.

19:28.703 --> 19:31.338
Thank you for asking.

19:31.371 --> 19:34.876
Feelings come and go, but...

19:34.909 --> 19:37.645
commitments...

19:40.014 --> 19:41.849
Oh!

19:43.584 --> 19:46.754
The hell was that?

19:58.933 --> 20:00.635
Oh!

20:00.668 --> 20:02.235
Did you see the size
of that thing?

20:08.543 --> 20:09.777
No, Tom, don't.

20:09.811 --> 20:11.344
Shh.

20:53.621 --> 20:55.022
No? Thanks, Bob.

20:55.056 --> 20:56.824
I thought it was a long shot.

20:56.858 --> 20:58.593
I just...

20:58.626 --> 21:00.494
you know, wondered
if she might have

21:00.528 --> 21:01.829
popped over to see Carol.

21:01.863 --> 21:04.999
Oh, never mind.

21:05.032 --> 21:06.768
She's home.

21:06.801 --> 21:09.537
Okay, talk soon.

21:16.043 --> 21:18.345
Anne.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.715
Where you been?

21:21.849 --> 21:23.885
At the mill.

21:23.918 --> 21:26.921
Oh. How'd it go?

21:26.954 --> 21:29.524
Fine.

21:29.557 --> 21:33.326
Well, it's really late,
you know?

21:33.360 --> 21:36.463
I know.

21:36.496 --> 21:39.066
I'm going to bed.

21:39.100 --> 21:42.103
Fine.

21:42.136 --> 21:46.007
I'll, um, be up later.

23:37.118 --> 23:39.452
<i>Reach.</i>

23:42.556 --> 23:46.426
<i>More aggressive.
Pull the elbow.</i>

23:48.062 --> 23:50.463
<i>Notice the springing motion
of the body.</i>

23:50.497 --> 23:51.966
<i>Up and down.</i>

23:56.771 --> 23:57.939
<i>Back to front.</i>

23:57.972 --> 23:59.140
<i>Reach.</i>

23:59.173 --> 24:01.742
Uh, I'm heading in soon.

24:01.776 --> 24:04.545
Did you make breakfast?

24:04.578 --> 24:06.213
<i>And back down.</i>

24:06.247 --> 24:09.917
I'm not hungry.

24:09.951 --> 24:11.719
<i>And back up.</i>

24:11.752 --> 24:13.888
Uh, I guess I'll just
pick something up

24:13.921 --> 24:15.690
- on my way into town.
- Bye.

24:15.723 --> 24:17.959
<i>Five, six.
Get ready to grape vine.</i>

24:17.992 --> 24:21.095
<i>To the right side.
Two, three, four.</i>

24:59.100 --> 25:01.969
What are you?

25:04.572 --> 25:06.741
What do you want?

25:15.316 --> 25:20.955
Who are you?

25:20.988 --> 25:25.292
And what do you want?

25:29.597 --> 25:32.767
Who are you?

25:32.800 --> 25:36.837
And what do you want?

25:52.653 --> 25:53.788
Hand it over.

25:53.821 --> 25:55.289
Hand what over?

25:55.322 --> 25:57.024
You know what I mean.

25:57.058 --> 25:59.860
Fuck you, old man.
This ain't the 1980s anymore.

25:59.894 --> 26:01.796
Yeah. It's still illegal
in this state.

26:01.829 --> 26:04.031
Why don't you go molest
an altar boy or something, huh?

26:04.065 --> 26:07.068
You mistake me for a priest.

26:07.101 --> 26:09.637
I'm a minister.

26:09.670 --> 26:12.039
This is a church.

26:13.307 --> 26:14.875
You should go home.

26:14.909 --> 26:16.777
Don't you know there's a girl
your age missing?

26:18.045 --> 26:19.914
Hey, cool it, Oscar.

26:19.947 --> 26:22.083
We want the cops called on us
or what?

26:22.116 --> 26:24.885
Fucking hate
old white dudes.

26:46.941 --> 26:49.844
Hello?

27:11.031 --> 27:12.666
Ahh.

27:29.049 --> 27:30.084
Aah!

27:30.117 --> 27:32.019
Geez. Ohh.

27:34.155 --> 27:35.990
Oh, good. You're home.

27:40.161 --> 27:41.862
Get changed.

27:41.896 --> 27:43.364
I'd like to go out.

28:02.049 --> 28:05.352
So, uh...

28:05.386 --> 28:07.254
What's the occasion?

28:08.923 --> 28:11.058
Does there need to be one?

28:13.794 --> 28:15.696
No, not really.

28:18.032 --> 28:19.333
It's just unusual.

28:21.536 --> 28:23.938
I must be feeling unusual.

28:35.049 --> 28:37.184
Could I get a to-go box
for my wife, please?

28:37.218 --> 28:39.887
Actually, I'm finished.

29:13.354 --> 29:15.356
I'm sorry, what?

29:15.389 --> 29:16.890
It's good.
You'll like it.

30:01.335 --> 30:02.403
Ah!

30:05.640 --> 30:07.941
I was just having a bad dream.

30:11.145 --> 30:13.347
I hope that's all it was.

30:13.380 --> 30:14.982
What's that mean?

30:19.353 --> 30:21.088
Let's talk about this later.

30:21.121 --> 30:23.123
Why do you always do this?

30:23.157 --> 30:24.391
Do what?

30:24.425 --> 30:25.292
Shut me down, push me aside.

30:25.326 --> 30:27.127
- You...
- Oh, come on. That's not true.

30:27.161 --> 30:28.462
Will you stop interrupting me?

30:28.495 --> 30:31.065
Let me finish my thought,
God damn it.

30:38.939 --> 30:40.608
Sorry.

30:56.390 --> 30:59.493
I don't know what's gotten
into you lately.

30:59.527 --> 31:03.631
But I need to prepare
the week's sermon.

31:03.665 --> 31:06.066
If that's okay.

31:09.069 --> 31:10.404
You know, I'm just gonna
get something to eat

31:10.437 --> 31:12.339
on the way into town.

31:12.373 --> 31:14.174
And don't blaspheme.

32:27.181 --> 32:29.450
Ma'am, can I help you
find something?

32:33.253 --> 32:36.624
How much of that could I get?

32:41.128 --> 32:43.096
You want the blood?

36:26.020 --> 36:28.923
Anne.

36:36.664 --> 36:38.231
Jakob.

36:38.265 --> 36:41.769
Bob's just on an investor call.
Come on in.

36:43.638 --> 36:45.606
Want some coffee or tea?

36:45.640 --> 36:48.241
Uh, you got something
a little bit stronger?

36:48.275 --> 36:50.545
Uh, tea with a shot of brandy?

36:50.578 --> 36:52.245
How about just the brandy.

36:57.652 --> 36:59.654
Alright.

37:01.589 --> 37:03.991
Hey.

37:05.492 --> 37:07.427
Where's Anne?

37:07.461 --> 37:09.329
Uh...

37:14.569 --> 37:17.437
Look, I just don't think
Anne's the type to fool around.

37:17.471 --> 37:18.438
I've already told you that.

37:18.472 --> 37:19.807
I'm not saying she is.

37:19.841 --> 37:21.709
But ever since
she met with Tom Low,

37:21.743 --> 37:23.443
she hasn't been acting right.

37:23.477 --> 37:24.979
I mean, 40 years
I've known this woman.

37:25.012 --> 37:26.514
Every day the same.

37:26.547 --> 37:28.348
Now I don't know who
I'm coming home to.

37:28.381 --> 37:31.552
She's hot, she's cold,
she's got a new dress, new hair.

37:31.586 --> 37:34.622
I-I can't figure her out.

37:34.655 --> 37:38.391
You got to confront him, then.

37:38.425 --> 37:40.293
I can't do that to Anne.

37:40.327 --> 37:42.063
It's your wife, Jakey.

37:42.096 --> 37:43.831
What do you think I would do

37:43.865 --> 37:47.367
if Carol came home with
that kind of bullshit?

37:47.400 --> 37:50.403
Yeah, well, I don't know
where to find him.

37:50.437 --> 37:52.940
He's down here working
in the mill, right?

37:52.974 --> 37:54.842
So start there and don't stop

37:54.876 --> 37:57.612
until he understands
the damn message.

37:57.645 --> 37:59.446
Hm.

38:00.915 --> 38:03.416
Wow.

38:05.553 --> 38:08.723
Just do it before we come over
this weekend for dinner.

38:08.756 --> 38:10.892
'Cause Carol's making lasagna,

38:10.925 --> 38:14.562
and I just don't want things
to be all weird.

39:14.789 --> 39:15.990
Anne.

39:16.023 --> 39:17.959
Ohh.

40:37.238 --> 40:38.940
Anne!

40:41.809 --> 40:43.476
What are you doing?

40:52.687 --> 40:56.123
In his second letter
to the Corinthians,

40:56.157 --> 41:00.928
Paul takes this idea
a step further

41:00.962 --> 41:05.066
and asks directly

41:05.099 --> 41:08.736
"How do you know, husband,

41:08.769 --> 41:13.574
whether you will
save your wife?"

41:13.607 --> 41:16.544
And the answer, of course,
is you can never know.

41:18.212 --> 41:24.552
And so we are left with faith...

41:27.321 --> 41:34.061
...in the promise that
God will take every situation

41:34.095 --> 41:39.066
and turn it to His purpose.

41:42.837 --> 41:46.974
What on God's green earth
have you been eating?

41:47.008 --> 41:49.276
I swear, Anne,
this looks like dirt.

41:50.711 --> 41:52.146
Now you're just being cruel.

41:52.179 --> 41:54.515
Cruel is when you see my bill.

41:59.587 --> 42:01.822
That's odd.

42:01.856 --> 42:03.924
You've got new teeth coming in.

42:06.360 --> 42:07.795
What?

42:07.828 --> 42:11.766
It's rare,
but it's not unheard of.

42:11.799 --> 42:15.069
We should set an appointment
and check them out.

42:15.102 --> 42:17.071
Here. Rinse.

42:20.274 --> 42:23.010
Let's brighten that smile.

44:10.818 --> 44:13.420
Tom Low?

44:53.294 --> 44:56.297
Tom Low?

44:56.330 --> 44:58.032
It's Jakob Fedder.

44:58.065 --> 45:01.302
Anne's husband.

45:01.335 --> 45:04.038
I need to talk to you.

45:56.524 --> 45:58.359
- Aah!
- Man!

45:58.392 --> 46:00.261
Geez! Ah!

46:00.294 --> 46:02.997
Creepy old man, I don't know why
you have such a hard-on for us,

46:03.030 --> 46:04.532
but why don't you piss off?

46:04.566 --> 46:06.800
Sorry. Sorry. I'm...
I was looking for someone else.

46:06.834 --> 46:08.502
Yeah, cool it, Oscar.
He's harmless.

46:08.536 --> 46:10.371
Yeah. No, she's right.
I'm leaving.

46:10.404 --> 46:13.240
Kick rocks. Go.
Get the fuck out of here.

46:14.408 --> 46:15.543
Come on, let's go.

46:15.577 --> 46:18.078
Hey! Aah!

46:18.112 --> 46:20.582
Oh, sh... Hey, man, come on,
I'm just...

46:20.615 --> 46:22.082
I was just playing, man.

46:22.116 --> 46:23.951
Just stay back.

46:23.984 --> 46:26.353
Come on, man.
I was just playing.

46:44.572 --> 46:46.440
Amelia!

46:46.473 --> 46:49.009
How's my suffering mother?

46:49.043 --> 46:50.210
Did you bless her?

46:50.244 --> 46:52.379
With God's almighty love?

46:52.413 --> 46:54.381
Are you here to bless me now?

46:54.415 --> 46:56.984
Because I don't want
your God's love.

46:57.017 --> 47:03.190
I've found a new savior.

47:03.223 --> 47:10.130
With a love that gives me
strength instead of fear.

47:10.164 --> 47:12.232
A love for myself.

47:13.500 --> 47:15.603
And right now...

47:15.637 --> 47:17.304
Aah!

47:17.338 --> 47:21.108
...my master...

47:21.141 --> 47:24.512
is in your house.

48:19.567 --> 48:20.702
Anne.

48:22.637 --> 48:25.372
The Lord is my savior.

48:25.406 --> 48:26.674
He restoreth my soul.

48:26.708 --> 48:28.475
He leads me in the path
of righteousness.

48:28.510 --> 48:29.611
Bullshit!

48:29.644 --> 48:31.945
Lord, forgive her.

48:31.979 --> 48:33.447
She's corrupted.

48:33.480 --> 48:36.350
Give me the strength
to save her wayward soul.

48:40.354 --> 48:44.024
I'm gonna tongue-fuck
a hole in your neck

48:44.057 --> 48:48.563
until I puke blood.

48:50.698 --> 48:53.100
Take that, bitch.

48:53.133 --> 48:55.335
Go, go!

49:10.017 --> 49:12.219
Why the fuck would she do that?!

49:12.252 --> 49:14.288
Shit bit Oscar's throat!

49:14.321 --> 49:15.690
She killed him!

49:15.723 --> 49:17.659
Look, we're safe out here, okay?

49:17.692 --> 49:20.260
That was some motherfuckin'
vampire shit, okay?!

49:20.294 --> 49:21.563
We need to report it.

49:21.596 --> 49:24.164
I got to check on my wife.

49:24.198 --> 49:25.700
Fuck off, then!

49:25.733 --> 49:27.267
I'm going to the cops.

49:47.387 --> 49:50.625
Is she having a heart attack?

49:50.658 --> 49:52.493
Hey, Mrs. Fedder, you alright?

49:56.831 --> 49:58.766
Mrs. Fedder, you...

50:03.771 --> 50:05.272
You okay in ther...

50:07.575 --> 50:09.243
You alright... Mrs. Fedder!

50:11.679 --> 50:13.380
Mrs. Fedder?

50:13.413 --> 50:17.351
Hello?

50:17.384 --> 50:19.654
Hey, are you okay in here?

50:23.591 --> 50:26.059
Hey, Mrs. Fedder?

50:27.361 --> 50:29.396
Hello?

50:29.429 --> 50:31.365
Hey.

50:34.636 --> 50:36.571
Hey, you alright?

50:38.438 --> 50:40.474
Hey, could you say something,
please?

50:40.508 --> 50:44.779
This is getting...
fairly uncomfortable for me.

50:44.812 --> 50:47.214
Suf...

51:08.502 --> 51:09.837
No, no, no, no. God!

51:09.871 --> 51:11.405
No.

51:13.508 --> 51:15.777
Anne!

51:23.183 --> 51:24.451
Aaah!

51:28.455 --> 51:29.624
I'm sorry, Jakob!

51:29.657 --> 51:31.859
It wasn't me.

51:33.293 --> 51:34.696
- Of course it was you!
- No!

51:34.729 --> 51:37.464
I-I didn't want to do it!
I was being controlled!

51:37.497 --> 51:39.601
This isn't me!
It isn't me!

51:39.634 --> 51:41.501
Well, who is it, then?!

51:42.904 --> 51:46.239
Something... happened, Jakob.

51:46.273 --> 51:47.909
What does that mean?

51:47.942 --> 51:51.879
- Something happened? When?
- The day that I met with Tom...

51:51.913 --> 51:53.447
I kissed him, okay?

51:53.480 --> 51:55.415
But then...

52:11.866 --> 52:14.434
This is so f...

52:14.468 --> 52:16.504
effed up!

52:33.320 --> 52:34.656
Reverend.

52:34.689 --> 52:36.390
Hey, Mike.

52:36.423 --> 52:39.661
- Any news on Amelia?
- Uh, sort of.

52:39.694 --> 52:41.395
Well, not really.

52:41.428 --> 52:43.263
It's strange, actually.

52:43.296 --> 52:44.966
Strange?

52:44.999 --> 52:48.435
Do you know of a young women
by the name of Eli Shenks?

52:48.468 --> 52:51.271
No, I don't think so.

52:51.304 --> 52:52.974
You sure you haven't seen her
skateboarding around town

52:53.007 --> 52:54.709
with her boyfriend, Oscar?

52:54.742 --> 52:57.645
Anyway, she dropped by
the station in quite a state.

52:57.679 --> 52:59.379
She claims Oscar was murdered

52:59.413 --> 53:01.683
at the old Cripple Creek Mill...

53:01.716 --> 53:03.751
by a vampire.

53:03.785 --> 53:06.688
And she identified Amelia.

53:06.721 --> 53:09.624
I chalk that up
to really bad taste on her part.

53:09.657 --> 53:11.693
But still, we had to go up there
and check it out.

53:11.726 --> 53:13.460
Yeah. And...?

53:13.493 --> 53:15.362
And there was nothing.

53:15.395 --> 53:16.631
No body, no blood.

53:16.664 --> 53:18.365
Well...

53:18.398 --> 53:20.434
that must be a relief.

53:20.467 --> 53:24.572
Yeah, except she swears
that you were there.

53:25.973 --> 53:27.842
Um...

53:27.875 --> 53:29.409
Well, I don't know what
she's talking about.

53:29.443 --> 53:31.478
- I wasn't at the mill.
- Oh, of course not.

53:31.512 --> 53:33.313
I mean, she says you were
the one fighting the vampires.

53:34.716 --> 53:37.451
- That's...
- Crazy, right?

53:37.484 --> 53:38.820
Yeah.

53:38.853 --> 53:40.021
Yeah, I'm just assuming
that's just some

53:40.054 --> 53:42.289
drugged-up preoccupation
on her part.

53:42.322 --> 53:44.525
Oh.

53:44.559 --> 53:46.493
There is one thing
we found out there, though.

53:48.796 --> 53:50.798
Isn't that your church's stamp?

53:50.832 --> 53:52.767
I mean,
what do you make of that?

53:55.502 --> 53:57.304
I have no idea.

53:57.337 --> 53:58.506
Hmm.

53:59.774 --> 54:01.642
Yeah. Me neither.

54:01.676 --> 54:03.878
You know, normally I wouldn't
take these things so seriously,

54:03.911 --> 54:06.480
but the boy did go missing.

54:06.514 --> 54:08.716
Just like Amelia and Tom Low.

54:12.553 --> 54:13.888
Tom Low?

54:13.921 --> 54:16.858
- Well, he lives in Chicago.
- He does.

54:16.891 --> 54:18.593
He came down here
to do some business.

54:18.626 --> 54:20.995
We found his vehicle abandoned
up at the mill, also.

54:21.028 --> 54:22.897
He could have just skipped town.
Who knows?

54:22.930 --> 54:24.498
But still, the timing is just...

54:26.834 --> 54:28.703
...odd.

54:28.736 --> 54:30.938
Anyway, I'm sorry to bother you
with all this stuff.

54:30.972 --> 54:32.339
Just tell Anne I said hello.

54:32.372 --> 54:33.541
Sounds like she's pretty...

54:33.574 --> 54:34.575
busy at the moment.

54:34.609 --> 54:36.309
She is. Yeah.

54:36.343 --> 54:38.613
Okay. Well, Mike, you take care.

54:38.646 --> 54:41.716
Yeah. You, too.

54:44.619 --> 54:47.354
Why didn't you tell me
when this first happened?

54:47.387 --> 54:49.322
I could have helped you.

54:52.894 --> 54:54.662
I felt ashamed.

54:56.597 --> 54:58.533
As you should.

55:06.908 --> 55:10.343
I'm sorry I hurt you.

55:10.377 --> 55:15.348
But there are blessings
to this change, you know?

55:15.382 --> 55:17.919
I feel more alive
than I have in years.

55:17.952 --> 55:19.987
Yeah, well,
don't get used to it.

55:20.021 --> 55:23.524
Drinking blood is not exactly
a sustainable lifestyle.

55:26.594 --> 55:27.995
What do we do now?

55:30.665 --> 55:33.034
I find The Master that
Amelia was talking about,

55:33.067 --> 55:34.602
and I kill him,

55:34.635 --> 55:35.803
and I change you back

55:35.837 --> 55:37.872
to the way you were.

55:37.905 --> 55:39.707
The way I was?

55:39.740 --> 55:41.374
Absolutely.

55:41.408 --> 55:42.977
Exactly.

55:43.010 --> 55:47.114
Put a stop to this insanity
before it goes any further.

56:08.169 --> 56:10.905
What does he look like?

56:10.938 --> 56:12.874
I don't know.

56:16.911 --> 56:20.514
At first,
all I could see was a shadow.

56:20.548 --> 56:24.819
A shape that I couldn't
really make out.

56:24.852 --> 56:27.755
But with each visit...

56:27.788 --> 56:30.591
the shape does become stronger.

56:32.627 --> 56:36.163
Like... it's coming into focus.

56:36.197 --> 56:37.565
Well, I was
thinking about the mill

56:37.598 --> 56:39.634
where you and Tom were attacked.

56:39.667 --> 56:42.036
You know,
what was Amelia doing there?

56:42.069 --> 56:44.639
I mean, are they all
hiding there?

56:44.672 --> 56:47.575
It might be a pretty clever way
to get around the country,

56:47.608 --> 56:50.144
dying towns and abandoned mills,

56:50.177 --> 56:53.848
you know,
far from the prying eyes.

56:55.616 --> 56:57.718
This town is perfect then.

56:58.953 --> 57:00.487
I'm just trying to figure out

57:00.521 --> 57:03.490
why The Master would
keep coming after you.

57:07.228 --> 57:09.163
Are you jealous?

57:13.234 --> 57:15.468
Well...

57:15.502 --> 57:16.837
you lusted after another man,

57:16.871 --> 57:18.839
and then you act...

57:18.873 --> 57:20.808
Careful, Jakob.

57:24.111 --> 57:25.646
Given the circumstances,

57:25.680 --> 57:28.883
I think I'm being
quite reasonable.

57:50.137 --> 57:52.773
Do you remember
when we started this?

57:55.242 --> 57:56.844
Of course.

57:58.846 --> 58:02.683
You asked for the seeds
as a wedding gift.

58:16.297 --> 58:20.234
I just think it's safer
if I go in alone.

58:20.267 --> 58:23.170
I mean, we don't know how you're
gonna behave in his presence.

58:23.204 --> 58:25.940
I mean, you could freak out,

58:25.973 --> 58:29.210
you know,
or turn into a bat or something.

58:30.845 --> 58:33.214
I didn't come here
to sit in the car.

58:33.247 --> 58:35.883
Well, it's too risky.

58:37.818 --> 58:40.955
Besides, you don't have a stake.

58:44.625 --> 58:46.293
- Pull over.
- Hmm?

58:46.327 --> 58:48.763
You heard me.

59:01.142 --> 59:02.143
There.

59:02.176 --> 59:03.878
Now I have a stake.

59:33.908 --> 59:35.776
Are you ready?

59:35.810 --> 59:37.645
What do you mean, ready?

59:37.678 --> 59:40.748
For whatever we find down there.

59:40.781 --> 59:44.718
I'm a minister of the Lord,
Anne.

59:44.752 --> 59:47.121
This is what I was trained for,
to fight evil,

59:47.154 --> 59:49.023
whatever form it may come in.

59:49.056 --> 59:52.126
Will you stop with
the Sunday School crap?

59:52.159 --> 59:54.728
If we go down there,
we go together...

59:54.762 --> 59:56.964
as equals.

59:56.997 --> 59:59.100
Are you okay with that?

1:00:00.868 --> 1:00:02.903
Let's just get this over with.

1:00:59.793 --> 1:01:00.961
Amelia?

1:01:02.730 --> 1:01:04.398
We've come to help you.

1:01:04.431 --> 1:01:06.834
You've come
to help me, Reverend?

1:01:06.867 --> 1:01:09.069
That's very considerate.

1:01:09.103 --> 1:01:12.406
Perhaps you should
help your wife instead.

1:01:14.341 --> 1:01:19.246
Or does he not find the new you
very attractive, Mrs. Fedder?

1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:22.349
Obedience and submission...

1:01:22.383 --> 1:01:24.952
that's more their style.

1:01:24.985 --> 1:01:28.923
But... you have...
The Master's love now.

1:01:31.926 --> 1:01:33.160
Aaaah!

1:01:33.194 --> 1:01:34.428
There's not a Goddamn thing

1:01:34.461 --> 1:01:36.497
you can do about it, shit bird.

1:01:39.833 --> 1:01:42.803
Jakob, how could you?!

1:01:42.836 --> 1:01:44.506
Attacking a child.

1:01:44.539 --> 1:01:46.373
Where is your compassion?

1:01:46.407 --> 1:01:48.976
You have plenty for your wife,

1:01:49.009 --> 1:01:50.512
even though she...

1:01:50.545 --> 1:01:52.413
- Shut up!
- Anne, please.

1:01:52.446 --> 1:01:54.481
Can't you hear her.
She's still Amelia.

1:01:54.516 --> 1:01:56.383
Don't be an idiot.
Kill her.

1:01:56.417 --> 1:01:57.952
No!

1:01:57.985 --> 1:01:59.486
No, there has to
be a better way.

1:01:59.521 --> 1:02:02.022
- She's manipulating you.
- She's lying to you, Jakob.

1:02:02.056 --> 1:02:05.759
Lord, please, protect me.

1:02:10.064 --> 1:02:11.799
I knew you'd wuss out.

1:02:11.832 --> 1:02:13.867
- I told you no!
- And I told you to kill her!

1:02:13.901 --> 1:02:15.202
I could have saved her!

1:02:15.236 --> 1:02:16.770
Where's your compassion
for God's sake?

1:02:16.804 --> 1:02:17.972
- Compassion?!
- You mercy?

1:02:18.005 --> 1:02:19.507
Don't be naive, Jakob.

1:02:19.541 --> 1:02:21.242
She would have sucked you dry.

1:02:21.275 --> 1:02:23.844
What am I letting you
turn me into?!

1:02:23.877 --> 1:02:26.313
I can't do this!

1:02:28.115 --> 1:02:29.283
The Master might
still be in there.

1:02:29.316 --> 1:02:30.518
We need to finish this.

1:02:30.552 --> 1:02:32.386
"The Master."
What does it matter?

1:02:32.419 --> 1:02:34.288
You're no different
from him now.

1:02:34.321 --> 1:02:36.524
- You two can have each other.
- How can you say that?

1:02:36.558 --> 1:02:38.425
- I'm your wife!
- Not anymore.

1:02:38.459 --> 1:02:41.529
You belong to him.
That's your punishment.

1:02:41.563 --> 1:02:43.964
It's my what?

1:02:43.998 --> 1:02:47.067
If you hadn't had your
little rendezvous with Tom Low,

1:02:47.101 --> 1:02:48.369
none of this would be happening.

1:02:48.402 --> 1:02:51.839
This isn't about
Tom or The Master.

1:02:51.872 --> 1:02:54.074
This is about us, you and me.

1:02:54.108 --> 1:02:55.976
You had sin in your heart,

1:02:56.010 --> 1:02:58.379
and you brought this
on yourself.

1:02:58.412 --> 1:03:02.316
So, you're blaming me
for being bitten by a vampire?

1:03:02.349 --> 1:03:05.085
Well, guess what.

1:03:05.119 --> 1:03:06.987
I think you're just saying
these horrible things

1:03:07.021 --> 1:03:08.889
because you're scared.

1:03:08.922 --> 1:03:10.424
You're scared to fight for me

1:03:10.457 --> 1:03:11.992
because ever since
we got married,

1:03:12.026 --> 1:03:13.360
you haven't had to.

1:03:13.394 --> 1:03:15.262
I've always just been there,

1:03:15.296 --> 1:03:18.032
doing exactly what you
expected me to do.

1:03:19.601 --> 1:03:21.468
You don't know how
to fight for me

1:03:21.502 --> 1:03:24.238
because you've never done it.

1:03:24.271 --> 1:03:27.174
So instead...

1:03:27.207 --> 1:03:29.076
you're just writing me off

1:03:29.109 --> 1:03:32.179
as some fallen scarlet woman.

1:03:34.448 --> 1:03:39.887
And that's pathetic and weak.

1:03:39.920 --> 1:03:42.122
You're weak.

1:03:42.156 --> 1:03:44.626
Think what you want.

1:03:44.659 --> 1:03:47.928
I've already crossed
too many lines for you.

1:03:47.961 --> 1:03:49.997
You're a Goddamn coward.

1:03:50.030 --> 1:03:52.567
I'm getting out of this
while I still can,

1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:56.638
while I still have
a little piece of my soul left!

1:04:00.474 --> 1:04:03.877
Maybe I like who I am now!

1:04:55.429 --> 1:04:57.364
What am I doin'?

1:05:17.652 --> 1:05:19.587
Annie?

1:06:37.632 --> 1:06:39.166
Aaah!

1:07:11.365 --> 1:07:13.133
Jakob?

1:08:18.533 --> 1:08:20.400
Jakob?

1:08:54.636 --> 1:08:57.204
With one gesture...

1:08:57.237 --> 1:09:00.307
this could get very messy.

1:09:00.340 --> 1:09:03.410
Hurting him won't make me yours.

1:09:03.443 --> 1:09:06.514
I seek no ownership.

1:09:06.547 --> 1:09:08.916
This is about you.

1:09:08.950 --> 1:09:11.686
Try and fight it.

1:09:11.719 --> 1:09:17.725
But you are no longer
what you once were.

1:09:17.759 --> 1:09:22.563
Why keep letting this anchor
drag you down?

1:09:27.300 --> 1:09:29.336
Because I love him.

1:09:29.369 --> 1:09:33.306
Die or thrive.

1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:35.475
The choice is yours.

1:09:39.479 --> 1:09:42.583
Please...

1:09:44.418 --> 1:09:46.654
No! No!

1:09:48.589 --> 1:09:50.390
Don't!

1:10:18.418 --> 1:10:20.621
It's gonna get a lot worse.

1:11:11.639 --> 1:11:13.340
Thank you.

1:11:31.391 --> 1:11:33.060
That's not good.

1:11:33.094 --> 1:11:34.796
We're running out of time.

1:11:34.829 --> 1:11:36.931
We got to find her,

1:11:36.964 --> 1:11:38.666
and then we're gonna beat this
together.

1:11:38.699 --> 1:11:40.034
This is just a test.

1:11:40.067 --> 1:11:41.769
This...

1:11:41.803 --> 1:11:44.404
thirst is getting unbearable.

1:11:44.437 --> 1:11:45.773
Well, what about the raw meat?

1:11:45.807 --> 1:11:48.375
Did you even try it?

1:11:48.408 --> 1:11:49.744
It's all trash.

1:11:49.777 --> 1:11:52.680
It doesn't do anything.

1:11:52.713 --> 1:11:54.549
Look, look.

1:11:54.582 --> 1:11:56.784
You got to fight it.
It's just a sickness.

1:11:56.818 --> 1:11:59.020
I'm sick, alright?

1:11:59.053 --> 1:12:03.858
My thoughts are drenched
in blood.

1:12:03.891 --> 1:12:05.993
River of blood.

1:12:10.097 --> 1:12:12.533
I've got an idea.

1:12:23.443 --> 1:12:26.581
You're right.
It is helping.

1:12:30.585 --> 1:12:33.120
Dare to take drugs off of kids.

1:12:38.826 --> 1:12:42.597
It's been a long time
since I heard your laugh.

1:12:42.630 --> 1:12:46.100
It's been a long time
since I felt like laughing.

1:12:50.605 --> 1:12:53.473
I'm sorry I talk over you
sometimes.

1:12:56.744 --> 1:12:58.378
Thank you.

1:12:59.814 --> 1:13:02.783
I'm sorry I don't speak up
more often.

1:13:10.892 --> 1:13:12.927
What do we do now?

1:13:16.097 --> 1:13:17.632
Pray for a miracle.

1:13:27.041 --> 1:13:29.610
Hello.

1:13:29.644 --> 1:13:33.214
Yes. Of course.
How are you?

1:13:33.247 --> 1:13:34.949
Oh.

1:13:34.982 --> 1:13:36.984
Sorry to hear that.

1:13:38.953 --> 1:13:41.989
Sure.
Be happy to check on her.

1:13:42.023 --> 1:13:45.092
No problem at all.

1:13:45.126 --> 1:13:47.695
Okay.
I'll call you back.

1:13:48.963 --> 1:13:53.134
Are you okay to drive?

1:14:28.869 --> 1:14:30.905
Is The Master here?

1:14:59.133 --> 1:15:01.702
Mattie?

1:15:01.736 --> 1:15:04.739
It's Mr. and Mrs. Fedder.

1:15:04.772 --> 1:15:06.107
Your daughter called.

1:15:06.140 --> 1:15:08.943
She said you weren't answering
your phone.

1:15:56.057 --> 1:15:58.159
Oh, Mattie.

1:16:03.664 --> 1:16:05.766
I don't see any bites.

1:16:12.406 --> 1:16:14.608
What do we do?

1:16:18.379 --> 1:16:20.081
Oh, Lord.

1:16:20.114 --> 1:16:22.683
Thank you
for this bountiful gift

1:16:22.716 --> 1:16:23.951
in our time of need.

1:16:23.984 --> 1:16:25.219
Amen.

1:16:29.356 --> 1:16:31.058
It's a sign, Annie.

1:17:04.358 --> 1:17:06.927
That looks heavy.

1:17:06.961 --> 1:17:09.330
This is... just our laundry.

1:17:09.363 --> 1:17:12.967
Yeah.
Mrs. Perkins washed it for us.

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.369
It doesn't look like laundry
to me.

1:17:15.402 --> 1:17:19.707
It looks like Mrs. Perkins
all rolled up in a bedspread.

1:17:19.740 --> 1:17:21.242
Go inside.

1:17:21.275 --> 1:17:25.045
Only if you tell me
a swear word.

1:17:25.079 --> 1:17:26.780
I'm not telling you
a swear word.

1:17:26.814 --> 1:17:29.350
Well, then I'm staying
right here.

1:17:29.383 --> 1:17:30.384
Okay.

1:17:30.417 --> 1:17:32.453
How about this one?

1:17:32.486 --> 1:17:33.854
Fuck off.

1:17:33.888 --> 1:17:36.423
Already know that one.

1:17:42.730 --> 1:17:44.298
Alright.

1:18:01.115 --> 1:18:02.983
Hess here.

1:18:03.017 --> 1:18:04.885
Mike, it's... it's Mariana.

1:18:04.919 --> 1:18:07.154
Listen, I don't know
how to say this, um...

1:18:07.188 --> 1:18:09.056
but, uh...

1:18:09.089 --> 1:18:10.958
Well, what's wrong?

1:18:13.227 --> 1:18:15.796
It's the Reverend Fedder.

1:18:15.829 --> 1:18:18.199
I think I saw him
and Mrs. Fedder

1:18:18.232 --> 1:18:20.167
carrying a body
into their house.

1:18:37.918 --> 1:18:40.287
What are you doing!
Come on!

1:18:40.321 --> 1:18:44.158
I can't be part of this.

1:18:45.926 --> 1:18:48.462
You know,
it's an hour till sunset.

1:18:51.065 --> 1:18:53.434
I'd like to go check
if The Master is

1:18:53.467 --> 1:18:55.002
holed up there.

1:18:56.937 --> 1:18:59.840
We should do it together.

1:18:59.873 --> 1:19:01.809
That's what we are doing.

1:19:11.485 --> 1:19:13.787
Go gentle on her.

1:19:56.163 --> 1:19:58.098
Oh, fuck.

1:20:33.300 --> 1:20:35.169
Hey, Mike.
What's up?

1:20:35.202 --> 1:20:36.571
Hi, Jakob.

1:20:36.604 --> 1:20:38.972
I could really use your help
with something.

1:20:39.006 --> 1:20:41.208
Would you turn the engine off
and step out here.

1:20:41.241 --> 1:20:44.044
It would really save my back
the unnecessary strain.

1:20:52.219 --> 1:20:54.488
What's in the case?

1:20:54.522 --> 1:20:56.223
Uh, nothing.

1:20:56.256 --> 1:20:57.958
Just hospital supplies

1:20:57.991 --> 1:21:01.228
for administering last rites
and so forth.

1:21:01.261 --> 1:21:02.963
You mind if we take a look.

1:21:02.996 --> 1:21:04.498
Well, yes, I would, actually.

1:21:04.532 --> 1:21:07.434
I'm on my way to an important
appointment right now.

1:21:07.468 --> 1:21:12.473
Uh, I got to see
a very sick patient.

1:21:12.507 --> 1:21:14.208
- Very sick.
- You know what?

1:21:14.241 --> 1:21:15.943
Why don't we indulge
Deputy Colton?

1:21:15.976 --> 1:21:17.478
He's coming up with
a performance review

1:21:17.512 --> 1:21:18.946
end of the month, right?

1:21:18.979 --> 1:21:20.247
He could really use
the experience.

1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:21.248
Isn't that right, Colton?

1:21:21.281 --> 1:21:22.617
Right as rain, Sheriff.

1:21:22.650 --> 1:21:25.553
Step on back here, Jakob.

1:21:33.193 --> 1:21:35.062
This is not what you think.

1:21:35.095 --> 1:21:37.030
Oh, I'm sure we've seen worse.

1:21:47.374 --> 1:21:49.577
But it's vacation.
You get to do what you want.

1:21:49.611 --> 1:21:51.111
Yeah.

1:21:51.145 --> 1:21:52.580
That's what you say every time,

1:21:52.614 --> 1:21:55.182
and I never get to do
about half of what I want.

1:21:55.215 --> 1:21:57.084
Oh, come on.

1:21:57.117 --> 1:22:00.187
Well, let's pick... You pick
the place this time then.

1:22:00.220 --> 1:22:01.188
Fine.

1:22:01.221 --> 1:22:03.056
Do whatever you want.

1:22:03.090 --> 1:22:04.324
<i>You</i> can do whatever you want.

1:22:04.358 --> 1:22:06.226
I just want a margarita.

1:22:06.260 --> 1:22:08.530
As long
as you don't puke this time.

1:22:13.434 --> 1:22:17.204
- Thank you.
- Always, babe.

1:22:19.641 --> 1:22:21.175
A long week.

1:22:21.208 --> 1:22:23.410
Yeah, it sucks.

1:22:23.444 --> 1:22:25.479
I didn't go with
the spinach this time.

1:22:25.513 --> 1:22:27.549
I'm getting sick of it.

1:22:27.582 --> 1:22:29.283
I prefer your meat anyways.

1:22:29.316 --> 1:22:31.519
That's good stuff.

1:22:31.553 --> 1:22:33.487
Thank you.

1:22:52.206 --> 1:22:54.074
Anne!

1:22:59.112 --> 1:23:03.383
You ever see something
you couldn't explain, Sheriff?

1:23:03.417 --> 1:23:06.320
Oh, like a vampire, Jakob?

1:23:09.122 --> 1:23:11.659
How many people have you killed,
Reverend?

1:23:13.427 --> 1:23:15.329
<i>Sheriff Hess,</i>

1:23:15.362 --> 1:23:18.398
<i>you are never gonna believe
the call that just came in.</i>

1:23:21.368 --> 1:23:23.237
Uh, yeah.

1:23:23.270 --> 1:23:24.772
Yeah. Of course.

1:23:24.806 --> 1:23:27.542
Okay. Okay. Yes.

1:23:27.575 --> 1:23:29.443
Yes.

1:23:29.476 --> 1:23:30.645
Uh-huh.

1:23:30.678 --> 1:23:33.080
Okay. I will.

1:23:33.113 --> 1:23:36.518
Thank you, officer.
We'll be here.

1:23:36.551 --> 1:23:38.753
J... Just give me a sec.

1:23:40.688 --> 1:23:42.724
This is absolutely fucked,

1:23:42.757 --> 1:23:44.458
and if you drag Jakob
into this shit,

1:23:44.491 --> 1:23:47.729
I will kill you
before the cops get here.

1:23:49.664 --> 1:23:53.100
What is taking them so long?
I mean, what is going on?

1:23:53.133 --> 1:23:55.670
- I can't stay here anymore.
- They'll be here, okay?

1:23:55.703 --> 1:23:58.606
Just wait outside for them,
okay, huh?

1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:00.842
I love you.

1:24:02.877 --> 1:24:04.478
Yeah.

1:24:06.581 --> 1:24:09.817
I did hear that.

1:24:09.851 --> 1:24:13.788
No, she's still sitting there.
She hasn't said a word.

1:24:13.821 --> 1:24:16.624
Believe me,
I haven't taken my eyes off her.

1:24:20.127 --> 1:24:21.194
Aah!

1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:29.136
Goddamn it!

1:24:29.169 --> 1:24:30.672
Carol!

1:24:32.439 --> 1:24:35.342
Carol!

1:24:35.375 --> 1:24:36.878
Carol!

1:24:43.751 --> 1:24:46.688
Run and don't look back.

1:24:46.721 --> 1:24:49.122
Yeah, right.

1:24:49.156 --> 1:24:50.658
Get up.

1:25:10.712 --> 1:25:13.447
Carol?

1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:16.149
What in the hell are you doing?

1:25:25.860 --> 1:25:29.296
Adam was born first,

1:25:29.329 --> 1:25:31.331
and then Eve.

1:25:31.365 --> 1:25:33.901
It was not Adam
who was deceived,

1:25:33.935 --> 1:25:38.238
but the woman who was deceived
and fell into transgression.

1:25:38.271 --> 1:25:41.676
Does that sound fair to you?

1:25:41.709 --> 1:25:43.911
My husband is a good man.

1:25:43.945 --> 1:25:48.415
What does "good"
have to do with it?

1:25:48.448 --> 1:25:51.686
He is afraid
of the life within you.

1:25:51.719 --> 1:25:54.287
And you're not?

1:25:54.321 --> 1:25:56.858
I choose those I change

1:25:56.891 --> 1:25:58.526
with care.

1:26:06.801 --> 1:26:11.405
The rest are just pets.

1:26:11.438 --> 1:26:14.909
Oh!

1:26:17.912 --> 1:26:19.547
Anne...

1:26:21.549 --> 1:26:23.551
No!

1:27:07.729 --> 1:27:11.331
It's good to see you strong,
Anne.

1:27:11.364 --> 1:27:13.568
What do you want from me?

1:27:13.601 --> 1:27:15.803
Why do you always think

1:27:15.837 --> 1:27:19.941
in terms of what others want?

1:27:19.974 --> 1:27:26.346
Where do you think
that sad instinct comes from?

1:27:26.379 --> 1:27:29.617
I, too, was once a mouse,

1:27:29.650 --> 1:27:31.686
scurrying between the feet

1:27:31.719 --> 1:27:34.789
of self-important men.

1:27:34.822 --> 1:27:38.926
Until the day my master

1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:44.966
gifted me the kiss of eternity.

1:27:44.999 --> 1:27:47.034
It gave me confidence.

1:27:47.068 --> 1:27:50.337
It freed me from the shackles

1:27:50.370 --> 1:27:54.642
of domestic dependency.

1:27:54.675 --> 1:27:59.981
I see the same potential in you.

1:28:00.014 --> 1:28:02.415
What exactly

1:28:02.449 --> 1:28:05.753
do you want, Anne?

1:28:13.694 --> 1:28:17.064
I want to live a bigger life.

1:28:19.801 --> 1:28:21.836
You can.

1:28:21.869 --> 1:28:24.772
The choice has always

1:28:24.806 --> 1:28:28.609
been yours.

1:28:28.643 --> 1:28:32.379
Is that why
I haven't fully turned.

1:28:32.412 --> 1:28:34.515
Indeed.

1:28:36.150 --> 1:28:39.419
Taste my blood,

1:28:39.452 --> 1:28:42.690
and you'll control the hunger.

1:28:42.723 --> 1:28:45.458
You'll be beholden to nothing

1:28:45.492 --> 1:28:48.563
but your own whims.

1:28:48.596 --> 1:28:50.097
But if you don't,

1:28:50.131 --> 1:28:51.833
the hunger will continue

1:28:51.866 --> 1:28:54.635
to control you day

1:28:54.669 --> 1:28:55.870
after day...

1:28:56.904 --> 1:28:58.573
- Aaaah!
- Colton!

1:28:58.606 --> 1:29:00.775
I got him, Sheriff.

1:29:00.808 --> 1:29:03.544
Deputy, I thought
you said you got him.

1:29:06.147 --> 1:29:09.150
They'll never accept you now.

1:29:16.958 --> 1:29:18.659
What the fuck?

1:29:21.562 --> 1:29:24.632
Your life could be
so much bigger

1:29:24.665 --> 1:29:27.500
than this, Anne.

1:29:39.080 --> 1:29:41.649
It's time you made a decision

1:29:41.682 --> 1:29:44.552
for yourself.

1:29:44.585 --> 1:29:46.621
I'm stuck, Sheriff!

1:29:46.654 --> 1:29:48.522
What's that?

1:29:52.727 --> 1:29:54.896
Oh, shit!

1:29:57.031 --> 1:29:59.432
Ask yourself...

1:29:59.466 --> 1:30:02.169
how different the world seemed

1:30:02.203 --> 1:30:03.738
this week?

1:30:03.771 --> 1:30:05.806
How it sounded.

1:30:05.840 --> 1:30:08.209
How it tasted.

1:30:08.242 --> 1:30:10.811
30 years

1:30:10.845 --> 1:30:13.214
of being dutiful,

1:30:13.247 --> 1:30:15.482
obedient,

1:30:15.516 --> 1:30:17.551
supportive.

1:30:17.585 --> 1:30:23.591
But never satisfied
your own desires.

1:30:23.624 --> 1:30:26.694
Were you... ever...

1:30:26.727 --> 1:30:29.597
really you?

1:30:32.166 --> 1:30:36.871
Or were you just Jakob's wife?

1:30:41.909 --> 1:30:44.745
"The great dragon was
thrown down,

1:30:44.779 --> 1:30:46.814
that old serpent,

1:30:46.847 --> 1:30:49.951
who was called the Devil
and Satan,

1:30:49.984 --> 1:30:53.054
deceiver of the whole world..."

1:30:53.087 --> 1:30:57.191
This is just their nature!

1:30:57.224 --> 1:31:02.730
This is how they'll always be.

1:31:02.763 --> 1:31:04.966
"Thrown down into the world

1:31:04.999 --> 1:31:08.035
and all his angels with him."

1:31:38.165 --> 1:31:40.901
What have you done?

1:31:42.303 --> 1:31:43.838
I finished it.

1:31:43.871 --> 1:31:45.206
That's what I've done.

1:31:45.239 --> 1:31:47.875
It wasn't your choice to make.

1:31:54.982 --> 1:31:57.685
How you gonna write
this one up, Deputy?

1:32:00.855 --> 1:32:02.890
Domestic dispute.

1:32:02.923 --> 1:32:05.726
Non-violent.

1:32:05.760 --> 1:32:07.094
Yeah.

1:32:07.128 --> 1:32:08.929
Yeah. That's a good answer.

1:32:13.134 --> 1:32:16.570
Listen, this is, uh...

1:32:16.604 --> 1:32:18.339
This is more your domain
than mine, Reverend.

1:32:24.078 --> 1:32:26.881
But it needs to end tonight.

1:32:53.841 --> 1:32:55.876
What do we do now?

1:33:04.185 --> 1:33:06.387
Sell the house.

1:33:06.420 --> 1:33:09.857
And just...

1:33:09.890 --> 1:33:11.926
vanish.

1:33:11.959 --> 1:33:14.195
Hmm.

1:33:18.899 --> 1:33:20.401
And I want to make
my own decisions

1:33:20.434 --> 1:33:24.004
from now on.

1:33:27.842 --> 1:33:30.111
Do we look for a cure?

1:33:32.279 --> 1:33:35.015
No.

1:33:35.049 --> 1:33:38.119
I like who I've become.

1:33:41.956 --> 1:33:44.325
The hunger will return.

1:33:47.461 --> 1:33:50.764
But we can still have
a happy marriage...

1:33:52.700 --> 1:33:54.401
...if we set some ground rules.

1:33:58.772 --> 1:34:01.976
So, I'm supposed to trust you?
