No, 'cause, like I said to you,
I had a bag over me head.

24:37.405 --> 24:38.606
I couldn't see a thing.

24:38.607 --> 24:39.807
Talk to me!

24:39.808 --> 24:41.809
Are you English?
You English?

24:41.810 --> 24:42.943
Yes!
Talk to me!

24:42.944 --> 24:44.345
Who are you?

24:44.346 --> 24:47.014
I love it when you go,
"Who are you?"

24:47.015 --> 24:48.582
When the adrenaline's
kicking in,

24:48.583 --> 24:49.650
you can hardly breathe,

24:49.651 --> 24:51.218
and you do a posh voice.

24:51.219 --> 24:53.687
"Who are you?"
[ Laughs ]

24:53.688 --> 24:56.223
Because it's terrifying, that,
not knowing what's going on.

24:56.224 --> 24:57.725
What is the number of him?!

24:57.726 --> 24:58.993
It's in me mobile.

24:58.994 --> 25:00.961
What mobile?!
What is the number of him?!

25:00.962 --> 25:02.429
I don't know!

25:02.430 --> 25:03.864
I don't even know me mum
and dad's number!

25:03.865 --> 25:06.033
I thought maybe
this is part of the setup.

25:06.034 --> 25:07.968
I don't know,
but my body didn't know

25:07.969 --> 25:10.371
because it was going through
the same thing

25:10.372 --> 25:12.539
as Terri White
would have gone through

25:12.540 --> 25:14.708
or whoever else
had been tied to a radiator.

25:14.709 --> 25:16.143
[ Shouts ]

25:19.748 --> 25:22.016
Did you learn anything
from that, though?

25:22.017 --> 25:24.752
That was important training
to make you able to cope

25:24.753 --> 25:27.454
if such a terrible thing
did occur to you.

25:27.455 --> 25:30.391
If you go to places that you're
in danger of being kidnapped,

25:30.392 --> 25:32.092
you're meant to have
a code word

25:32.093 --> 25:35.029
so that when the people
who've nicked you

25:35.030 --> 25:37.197
call up the London office...

25:37.198 --> 25:39.967
They go, "We've got Ricky,
Steve, and Karl here,"

25:39.968 --> 25:42.369
and the London office goes,
"Yeah, yeah."

25:42.370 --> 25:43.837
"Give us your code word."

25:43.838 --> 25:46.940
Well, at the time,
it was "congress tart."

25:46.941 --> 25:48.409
Congress tart?

25:48.410 --> 25:51.078
How are you gonna slip that
into a conversation?

25:51.079 --> 25:52.179
No, you don't slip it in.

25:52.180 --> 25:53.547
They've got a bag
over your head,

25:53.548 --> 25:54.782
gun to your head or whatever.

25:54.783 --> 25:56.350
"Tell them
you've been kidnapped,"

25:56.351 --> 25:57.718
and you go,
"congress tart."

25:57.719 --> 25:59.219
And they go, "Bloody hell,
he's been kidnapped."

25:59.220 --> 26:01.755
Before you know it,
the a-team's coming in.

26:01.756 --> 26:03.724
So, we're...Ring, ring.

26:03.725 --> 26:05.492
Hello, Karl, mate.
How's it going?

26:05.493 --> 26:06.560
Congress tart.

26:06.561 --> 26:07.461
What?

26:07.462 --> 26:08.862
Congress tart.

26:08.863 --> 26:10.397
Rick, who's on the phone, mate?

26:10.398 --> 26:11.865
It's Karl.

26:11.866 --> 26:13.600
He said, "congress tart," so
he's definitely been kidnapped.

26:13.601 --> 26:15.336
Who are they?
What do they want?

26:15.337 --> 26:17.538
Right.
Who am I talking to now?

26:17.539 --> 26:18.939
Them.
Ask them.

26:18.940 --> 26:22.409
What do you want?
He's asking what you want.

26:22.410 --> 26:25.012
Well, there's no one here to do
that bit of role-playing,

26:25.013 --> 26:27.281
so maybe you should tell me
what they're saying.

26:27.282 --> 26:29.283
They said...

26:29.284 --> 26:31.919
They just said they want to use
me as bargaining power.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.754
But what do they want?
But what do they want?

26:39.294 --> 26:40.761
What would they want?

Is it money?
Give them money... money.

26:44.032 --> 26:46.734
A million...
£2... £5 million.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.001
Too much.

26:48.002 --> 26:49.737
I'm not spending
that sort of cash.

26:49.738 --> 26:50.738
No, you don't do that.

26:50.739 --> 26:51.772
I'm not spending that cash.

26:51.773 --> 26:53.240
You see,
this is what worries me.

I'm not spending £5 million
to get you back.

26:55.076 --> 26:56.343
That's what's worrying.
No.

Because that's what
would have happened.

Can't we negotiate?
Put them on.

Never mind who it is.
Where's me £5 million?

27:08.523 --> 27:10.090
Can't afford £5 million
at the moment.

join the line

giving them something.

in Bulgaria?

of the place?

on it.
