00:07.808 --> 00:10.844
Man, there's just so much to
do to prepare for this wedding.

00:10.878 --> 00:14.482
I still have to get flowers,
hors d'oeuvres, a church.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.350
Well, maybe you should ask
Darlene to do some of it,

00:16.384 --> 00:19.053
if you weren't so damn whipped.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.355
Well, I think the
first order of business--

00:21.389 --> 00:24.125
Mom, you're only allowed
one suggestion per hour,

00:24.158 --> 00:25.426
and your last one
counted as two,

00:25.459 --> 00:27.495
because it went on too long.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.931
Mom, some guy just
delivered this for you.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.066
Well, I didn't order that.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.201
Did you give him any money?

00:33.234 --> 00:34.102
No.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.269
Oh, OK, well put it on there.

00:39.107 --> 00:42.576
Saw your commentary on
TV about how hard it is

00:42.610 --> 00:44.512
to find a decent wedding cake.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.781
Sincerely, Albano's
Bakery, Third and Main.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.284
Feel free to mention
us on your show.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.786
Yeah, and that's just
out and out bribery.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.588
It's totally unethical.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.857
And chocolaty.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.626
That cake won't last
until the wedding.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.795
That cake won't
last till dinner.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.465
So, just because you mentioned
wedding cakes on television,

01:04.498 --> 01:06.100
someone sent you a free one?

01:06.134 --> 01:10.204
Yeah, and they say
TV only adds 10 pounds.

01:10.238 --> 01:13.006
Whoa, I can see
my next commentary

01:13.040 --> 01:14.775
appearing before my eyes.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.845
I was wrong about bakeries.

01:17.878 --> 01:20.814
Albano's on Third and
Main is a great one.

01:20.848 --> 01:24.418
And I wonder where I can get
a decent wedding dress or hors

01:24.452 --> 01:28.422
d'oeuvres or a candy
apple red pump in a size

01:28.456 --> 01:31.292
7 1/2 with a low heel.

01:31.325 --> 01:34.395
That's it, my
divorce is final.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.531
Signed, sealed,
delivered, I'm alone.

01:37.565 --> 01:42.636
Legally, forever single
til death do I part.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.773
Hey, Jackie, a guy in a long
robe carrying a big sickle

01:45.806 --> 01:47.808
was by here looking for you.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.177
Go ahead and joke.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.512
You're not the one facing
a life of solitude.

01:51.545 --> 01:54.315
Or uneven mattress wear.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.584
Come on, Jackie,
you'll find someone.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.419
Who wouldn't want
to go out with you?

01:58.452 --> 01:59.520
That's easy for
you to say, you

01:59.553 --> 02:01.021
little frizzy haired Pollyanna.

02:03.757 --> 02:07.361
You talk to me after
a year of marriage.

02:07.395 --> 02:10.097
After you've taken up smoking
just to shave a couple of years

02:10.130 --> 02:13.567
off your miserable life.

02:13.601 --> 02:16.937
I'm gonna go work on
this seating chart now.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.040
Yeah, make sure you
put me between the priest

02:20.073 --> 02:21.409
and the florist.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.811
Hey, hey, don't
count out that priest.

02:23.844 --> 02:24.978
Times have changed.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.814
Jackie, I have just the tonic.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.549
Why don't you come
with me Saturday night

02:28.582 --> 02:30.618
to my ballroom dance class?

02:30.651 --> 02:33.654
Mom, why didn't I
think of that, mom?

02:33.687 --> 02:34.988
That's a great idea.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.557
I'm sure that the
man of my dreams

02:36.590 --> 02:39.026
is sitting at home right
now clipping on his bow tie

02:39.059 --> 02:42.863
and strapping on his truss.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.566
It's not just for seniors.

02:45.599 --> 02:49.737
There's plenty of cultured
and delightful gentlemen

02:49.770 --> 02:51.205
of all ages there.

02:51.239 --> 02:55.409
I may be desperate, but
I haven't sunk that low.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.745
Oh, really?

02:57.778 --> 03:00.748
Hey, I cannot believe that
I am agreeing with Mom here.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.816
You really should go.

03:02.850 --> 03:06.053
I was reading this big article
about how ballroom dancing

03:06.086 --> 03:08.489
is making a big ol' comeback.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.459
So you really don't think
it'd be a huge waste of time?

03:11.492 --> 03:12.460
No more than your marriage.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.731
All right, I'll go, all right.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.166
I'm gonna feel really stupid.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.770
Oh, goody, and I'll help
you pick out an outfit.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.205
Plus, perhaps we
can tease that hair

03:25.239 --> 03:27.074
into something presentable.

03:27.107 --> 03:30.177
Why don't you try to tease
it into a nice set of boobs?

03:34.147 --> 03:36.784
Roseanne, you might
like to come along too.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.453
Dance is good exercise.

03:39.487 --> 03:43.657
Hey, I am not divorced,
single, desperate or lonely.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.926
What the hell do I
need to exercise for?

[music playing]

04:37.945 --> 04:38.812
Hey.

04:38.846 --> 04:39.780
Hey.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.148
Mark, what happened
to your hand?

04:41.181 --> 04:45.386
He was working the saw and
he almost cut it off, again.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.588
Mark, what an idiot.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.522
What do you mean an idiot?

04:48.556 --> 04:49.623
Didn't you hear him?

04:49.657 --> 04:50.458
Almost.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.528
Unbelievable.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.430
Shouldn't you be sewing
up your wedding dress, Mary?

04:59.299 --> 05:02.302
Is he the dumbest
guy you've ever known?

05:02.336 --> 05:03.971
I work in the construction
business, David,

05:04.004 --> 05:06.940
I'd have to see a list.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.710
Mr. Conner, do you know
anything about wedding tuxes.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.845
I mean, you have
to wear underwear

05:11.879 --> 05:14.915
or are they built into the
pants like in bathing suits?

05:14.948 --> 05:16.850
Oh, David, I don't know.

05:16.884 --> 05:20.488
I don't feel like talking
about wedding stuff right now.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.656
You're still kind of angry
about this whole pregnancy

05:22.690 --> 05:24.725
wedding thing, aren't you?

05:24.758 --> 05:26.794
I am making great
strides in my acceptance

05:26.827 --> 05:28.161
of this difficult situation.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.434
Well, good.

05:33.467 --> 05:38.005
'Cause I really think
you're the greatest

05:38.038 --> 05:40.774
guy in the world,
Mr. Conner, and I

05:40.808 --> 05:43.444
want you to be my best man.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.447
Oh, I don't know.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.148
I know it's weird,
so don't answer now.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.182
Just think about it, all right?

05:49.216 --> 05:52.553
Yeah, I'll get back to you.

05:52.586 --> 05:56.023
You're going to love me
again one day, Mr. Conner.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.425
You'll see.

05:57.458 --> 06:01.028
I'll get back to
you about that, too.

Hello, Agnes.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.769
Hello.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.271
When we start dancing, if you
get confused, just follow her.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.205
The left leg.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.374
The right one she just drags.

There's people my age.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.679

there would be.

a man who likes to dance.

And who isn't like
a total troll.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.431
Well, my fiance and
I are taking dancing

06:37.465 --> 06:38.566
lessons for our wedding.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.468
In fact, that's why a
lot of people are here.

06:40.501 --> 06:44.237
Oh, really.
Who exactly?

06:44.271 --> 06:45.473
Well, our whole group.

06:45.506 --> 06:53.046
Ah ha, so that would be
basically everyone under 90.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.149
So OK, well, got to
get back to my mom.

06:56.183 --> 06:59.152
So you and your fiance
have a nice life.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.354
You know, I was once you.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.023
And now I'm me.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.058
So I will just
leave you with that.

07:08.295 --> 07:11.164
Mother, every man
here is engaged.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.667
Really, why that's lovely.

07:13.701 --> 07:16.937
Lovely, listen old woman,
I washed these hose out

07:16.970 --> 07:19.973
in the sink and put them on wet
because you told me that they

07:20.007 --> 07:20.908
were going to be guys here.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.477
Liar, liar!

Oh, Hal.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.198
Oh, Beverly, is
that a new scarf?

07:45.232 --> 07:46.333
Oh, yes.

07:46.366 --> 07:49.036
I knew we were going to
do the samba tonight,

07:49.069 --> 07:52.039
so I wanted to wear
something bold.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.708
You saucy little thing, you.

Oh, stop it.

Hal is flirting
with Bev again.

What else is new?

08:00.213 --> 08:01.849
Well, of course,
I'm flirting with her.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.617
Do you know why?

08:03.651 --> 08:05.252
Because it makes
you girls jealous.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.555
And when you get jealous,
your passions come out

08:07.588 --> 08:09.590
and you dance like tigresses.

08:15.028 --> 08:15.963
Wonderful.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.598
OK, everybody, get ready.

move those hips around.

Oh, that's hot.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.630
That is good.

All right, come on honey.

08:50.964 --> 08:51.865

- A turn, no.
- Yeah.

- I couldn't possibly.
- I'll show you.

- Oh, my.
- That's wonderful.

Oh, you're wonderful.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.711
What a natural you are.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.612
Thank you.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.813
Yeah, really.

09:05.846 --> 09:10.017
Tell me, are you going to
be one of my new pupils?

09:10.050 --> 09:12.285
Oh, Hal, I don't think so.

I'm not engaged and
I'm not decrepit.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.958
Oh, don't say that to me.

If you had a dagger, you
could plunge it into my heart.

You are a big flirt.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.533
With those big,
beautiful brown eyes,

09:26.566 --> 09:27.668
I could be anybody you want.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.074
But since you're not
my student, maybe

09:34.107 --> 09:36.409
we could have dinner together.

- Yes.

on the beach of Ipanema.

this free stuff.

thing I ever thought of.

Yes, I think at
least six of everything

you shamelessly mentioned on
the air has been delivered.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.666
That is not true.

10:32.700 --> 10:36.203
I did not get the bagel
slicer, the Fry Baby or the 24

10:36.236 --> 10:38.706
cubic foot Frigidaire.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.742
Which is almost enough
to hold the Conner family

10:41.775 --> 10:45.245
supply of breakfast meats.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.980
So where's the stuff you
said you got for the diner?

10:47.014 --> 10:48.181
Oh, man, you won't believe it.

of free hors d'oeuvres.

I figure the stuff we
recognize, we'll sell for a buck

10:53.320 --> 10:55.055
and other stuff, two bucks.

How come you're so tired?

Are you having that dream
about the giant monkey again?

11:05.899 --> 11:09.970
No, I happen to have
been out dancing all night.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.505
Oh, really, so you met
a guy at Mom's thing.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.407
I was right.
Yeah, so who is he?

11:14.441 --> 11:15.442
What's he like?

11:15.475 --> 11:20.013
Well, he's a guy
that likes to dance.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.148
You know the type.

11:21.181 --> 11:26.386
You know, he's got shoes
and that's who he is.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.055
Well, aside from the
likes to dance part,

11:28.088 --> 11:30.090
sounds just like Dan.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.059
There she is.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.562
You shameless hussy,
you stole my man!

11:40.801 --> 11:43.737
Stole your man, what
are you talking about?

11:43.771 --> 11:47.440
Are you going to deny that you
went out with Hal after class?

11:47.474 --> 11:49.042
He asked me out,
so I went with him.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.177
What's the big deal?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.545
So you just stole him
from your own mother,

11:52.579 --> 11:56.249
you, you, trollop!

11:56.283 --> 12:01.154
My sister and my mother are
fighting over the same guy?

12:01.188 --> 12:04.792
The only thing left for
this family is cannibalism.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.895
I didn't steal
anybody from her.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.963
The old bat's out of her mind.

12:09.997 --> 12:15.903
Floozy, Jezebel,
Little Miss Round Heels!

12:15.936 --> 12:17.537
Gee, Jackie,
doesn't that remind

12:17.570 --> 12:19.907
you of your sweet 16 party?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.508
So you think this is funny.

12:21.541 --> 12:25.078
Oh, I think everybody's
gonna think this is funny.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.446
[honking horn]

12:26.479 --> 12:29.516
Damn, there's
that sample limo.

12:29.549 --> 12:32.619
Well, hope I you
guys can keep this up

12:32.652 --> 12:34.955
till I get back from my
free hot air balloon ride.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.895
You do know that you and
Hal look ridiculous together.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.030
Mother!

12:43.063 --> 12:45.432
I'm not even going to
talk to you about this.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.499
What's wrong, Jackie?

12:46.533 --> 12:48.701
Been out of
circulation too long?

12:48.735 --> 12:51.071
Too scared to date
a man your own age?

12:51.104 --> 12:54.174
I'm not scared of anything.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.044
OK, there's the rabbits.

12:57.077 --> 13:00.213
Mom, well maybe a part of
it is that I haven't been

13:00.247 --> 13:01.748
out there in a number of years.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.985
But so Hal is a really nice
guy, he's safe, you know,

13:05.018 --> 13:06.486
what's wrong with that?

13:06.519 --> 13:08.221
Well, you're not
serious about him.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.756
You're taking advantage of him.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.858
Mom!

13:10.891 --> 13:12.559
You've been going down
there for two years.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.828
You've never even
been out with him.

13:14.862 --> 13:19.366
I've cleverly paced myself.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.535
And he was about
to make his move.

13:22.569 --> 13:26.306
Last week, instead
of calling me Bev,

13:26.339 --> 13:30.710
he accidentally called me bed.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.579
Well, there you are.

13:35.548 --> 13:40.487
Mother, that's not
exactly a relationship.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.722
You don't know
anything about Hal.

13:42.755 --> 13:48.361
Did you know he was one of the
original June Taylor Dancers?

13:48.395 --> 13:51.598
Look, Mom, I know you
like him, but listen to me.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.200
You weren't seeing him.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.203
I was seeing
him every Saturday

13:56.236 --> 13:58.038
night for the last two years.

13:58.071 --> 14:01.074
And it's been wonderful.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.776
We danced together, we chatted.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.745
And oh how we laughed.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.515
You could still do all that.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.617
No, I can't.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.552
It's ruined.

14:12.585 --> 14:16.523
From now on I guess I'll
just spend Saturday nights

14:16.556 --> 14:18.358
looking at television alone.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.061
Oh, Mom.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.964
I'll go down this
week and tell the gals.

14:23.997 --> 14:27.200
And then my dancing
days are through.

14:27.234 --> 14:31.338
Thank you, Jackie for
spoiling everything.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.009
Stole your mother's
boyfriend, eh?

14:38.845 --> 14:39.712
Been there.

14:39.746 --> 14:43.050
[music playing]

14:46.119 --> 14:47.554
Almost cutting my
hand off the other day

14:47.587 --> 14:49.022
really got me thinking
about a lot of stuff.

14:49.056 --> 14:49.923
Oh, yeah?

14:49.957 --> 14:51.058
Like what?

14:51.091 --> 14:53.260
Like what it'd be like
if I didn't have a hand.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.235
Should he be getting
ready for his wedding?

15:02.269 --> 15:03.770
I mean, is he even
thinking about it?

15:03.803 --> 15:05.605
Sure he is.

15:05.638 --> 15:09.009
He's helping Darlene with stuff,
he asked me to be his best man,

15:09.042 --> 15:12.379
he's on top of things.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.114
He asked you to
be his best man.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.086
Oh, did I say best man?

15:19.119 --> 15:20.920
I'm sorry, I got it wrong.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.022
He asked me to be his main man.

15:26.159 --> 15:26.960
Whatever.

15:31.965 --> 15:35.202
David, David.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.304
I've made up my mind
about being your best man

15:37.337 --> 15:39.406
and the answer is no.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.440
I understand.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.575
You hate me.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.478
No, I don't hate you.

15:45.512 --> 15:48.681
I mean it's very nice
that you asked me.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.284
I just think it'd be better
if you asked your brother.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.952
Mark?

15:52.986 --> 15:55.788
I don't like Mark.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.458
That's it, we just
don't get along.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.127
Aren't you supposed to
pick a best man you like

16:00.160 --> 16:02.295
and get along with?

16:02.329 --> 16:05.765
That's not even true
about the person you marry.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.669
Now, go on, he's your
brother, ask him.

16:09.702 --> 16:10.870
Fine.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.573
I can just hear his toast now.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.941
Chicks are weird, let's chug.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.445
There you go.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.716
Mark.

16:23.750 --> 16:24.551
Hey.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.691
So I've been
thinking about it and I

16:31.724 --> 16:33.960
want you to be my best man.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.629
Don't do me any favors, OK.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.399
I'm not doing you a favor.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.102
Look, you asked Dan
first instead of me.

16:42.135 --> 16:45.004
Why?

16:45.038 --> 16:46.473
Why?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.075
Do you really want to know why?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.142
Yeah, that's why I'm asking.

16:49.176 --> 16:53.513
OK, all right, fine, Mark.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.516
You tormented me my whole life.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.786
You know, my first memory is
of you stuffing me in a piano

16:59.819 --> 17:02.822
when I was three years old.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.092
You stole my allowance.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.693
You bent the spokes on my bike.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.763
You told every girl I had a
crush on that I had fleas.

17:10.797 --> 17:11.664
You did.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.067
That one summer.

17:14.101 --> 17:18.438
Face it, Mark, you
viciously bullied me

17:18.471 --> 17:19.806
until I was old
enough to figure out

17:19.839 --> 17:22.142
how to just avoid you
altogether, which is why

17:22.175 --> 17:23.410
we are the way we are today.

17:23.443 --> 17:27.680
And you wonder why I don't
ask you to be my best man?

17:27.714 --> 17:30.083
Yeah, why not?

17:30.117 --> 17:32.585
- I just told you, Mark.
- It doesn't matter.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.154
I don't want to be
your best man anyway.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.322
Fine, then just say no.

17:35.355 --> 17:36.523
Oh, you'd like
that, wouldn't you?

17:36.556 --> 17:39.626
Oh, you're driving me crazy.

17:39.659 --> 17:40.793
Mark, come here.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.796
Just say you'll be my
best man and shut up.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.933
Look at this, you
can't even ask me nicely.

17:46.966 --> 17:50.737
Ouch, fine, Mark, don't
be my best man, all right?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.905
Just kill me and put
me out of my misery.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.874
Look, if you're
that miserable,

17:54.907 --> 17:56.409
I'll be your best man.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.644
Will that make you happy?

17:57.677 --> 17:58.478
Yes.

18:03.950 --> 18:06.186
It's good, it's a good start.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.656
Yeah, I mean, we are brothers.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.858
Yeah.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.227
No way am I letting you
stuff that cake my face though.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.597
[music playing]

18:22.135 --> 18:24.837
You can't leave us, Bev.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.674
You're the spark plug
for our little ensemble.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.810
Please, ladies, allow me
to do this with dignity.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.545
I don't want to
end up like Ginger

18:32.579 --> 18:35.715
Rogers dancing past my prime.

18:35.748 --> 18:39.552
Well, ladies of
the chorus, adieu.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.924
And where do you think
you're going, Beverly?

18:44.957 --> 18:48.795
Oh, I just, I'm
quitting that class, Hal.

18:48.828 --> 18:49.696
Quitting.

18:49.729 --> 18:50.597
Yes.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.832
You can't quit.
We need you.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.734
I need you, huh?

18:54.767 --> 18:57.304
You're like a willow by a lake.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.405
Excuse me?

18:58.438 --> 19:01.841
You're like a raindrop
dancing on a window

19:01.874 --> 19:05.745
pane in a long hot
summer night in August.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.480
Oh, Hal, that's
what Jeff Chandler

19:07.514 --> 19:11.451
said to Mamie van Doren in
"Surrender in September."

19:11.484 --> 19:13.253
You were so wonderful in that.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.654
What was your line?

19:14.687 --> 19:15.822
I'll pull the car around.

19:18.558 --> 19:21.894
But this isn't a
movie, Hal, it's my life,

19:21.928 --> 19:24.297
and it's time for me
to get on with it.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.965
No, no, you can't.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.033
You can't.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.935
You're my favorites student.

19:28.968 --> 19:32.372
You're not gonna leave me alone
here with all these old ladies.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.473
Please don't.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.874
Jackie isn't old, Hal.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.276
Oh, her.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.345
Well, no, you raised
a very charming woman.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.248
I mean, a very, very nice,
and I like her, but--

19:41.281 --> 19:42.148
What are you saying?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.516
You're not interested in her?

19:43.550 --> 19:49.689
Now why should I settled for
a pale copy of the original?

19:49.722 --> 19:53.192
Oh, now I can't have you
disparaging my daughter.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.295
She's a fine young
woman and mother

19:55.328 --> 19:57.230
and I'm sure her
credit rating will

19:57.264 --> 19:59.699
be restored within the year.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.033
Please, you must stay.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.034
Should I?

20:02.068 --> 20:03.936
Oh, I don't know,
I just don't know.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.806
I'm not starting
this class without you.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.408
My Capezios are in the car.

we're going to do the rumba.

I'll be back in five.

say, Xavier Cugat.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.731

20:31.764 --> 20:33.666
Thanks, Hal, for doing that.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.968
She's such a sweet kid.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.704
And I wanted to thank
you also for the time

20:37.737 --> 20:39.306
that we spent
together, you know.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.573
I haven't been
dating for quite a

20:40.607 --> 20:42.041
while now it was
very sweet of you

20:42.074 --> 20:43.976
to help me get back
in there in the game.

20:44.010 --> 20:44.877
Oh, are you kidding?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.546
You're a beautiful woman.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.481
Guys are going to be lining up.

You're like a drop
of rain dancing

20:57.023 --> 21:01.461
on a window pane after a hot,
warm summer August night.

21:01.494 --> 21:12.839
Oh, Hal, and you, well you
are like the last piece of pizza

21:12.872 --> 21:20.813
that everyone wants and no one
will take because who knows how

21:20.847 --> 21:22.449
long it's been sitting there.

21:26.519 --> 21:30.457
Sure, kid, anything you say.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.826
Oh, and Hal, I just, I wanted
to ask you one other thing.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.695
You know, when we were out
dancing the other night

21:35.728 --> 21:40.467
and I don't know, I just
wanted to know, am I any good?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.300
You suck, baby.
