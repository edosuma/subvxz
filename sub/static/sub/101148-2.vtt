something about this

Why the elaborate theatre
of the macabre?

47:15.336 --> 47:16.935

his own needs,

47:16.937 --> 47:19.338

are not pecuniary.

from the apothecaries.

- It's a pain suppressant.

47:29.016 --> 47:31.284

it would kill a child.

47:32.753 --> 47:34.353

it's a sedative

47:34.355 --> 47:37.022
used to ease the pain
of mothers during childbirth.

47:37.158 --> 47:39.859
The most common place to
find it is a maternity ward.

47:41.428 --> 47:42.361
