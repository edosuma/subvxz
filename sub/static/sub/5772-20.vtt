00:03.637 --> 00:05.473
Mm, preferably another panini
if possible.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.208
I don't know if your press
can handle that.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.776
Can my press not handle it?

00:08.809 --> 00:10.278
Of course my press
can handle it.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.412
This is a restaurant model.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.647
I should not have gotten you
that press for Christmas.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.383
- My God.
- What's that big fancy letter?

00:15.416 --> 00:17.051
It's from Texas.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.386
- Oh, you know what I bet it is?
- Hmm?

00:18.419 --> 00:19.720
A thank-you note
from George W. Bush

00:19.753 --> 00:21.122
for buying
one of his paintings.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.590
Oh, yeah?

00:22.623 --> 00:26.494
"To my closest bros and hos,

- What?
- Okay.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.209
[groans]
Damn it, Danny.

01:15.243 --> 01:18.112
Ugh, none of my clothes fit
anymore.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.448
This is the fattest
I've ever been.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.116
And that's coming from a girl
who, in middle school,

01:22.150 --> 01:23.617
had a chocolate fountain
in her bedroom.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.853
Babe, come on.
You're pregnant.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.255
You got a great glow.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.122
Please.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.757
Do not start
with the pregnant lady glow.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.192
That's all made up,
you know.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.460
And do not call me radiant.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.295
If one more person
calls me frickin' radiant,

01:34.328 --> 01:35.296
I'm gonna kill someone.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.297
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:36.330 --> 01:37.298
This isn't a glow.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.799
This is sweat
from exertion

01:38.832 --> 01:41.402
from trying to pull these jeans
around my fat ass.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.803
You know what, I know
what would make you feel sexy.

01:42.836 --> 01:43.804
Yeah?

01:43.837 --> 01:44.872
We haven't taken the D-train

01:44.905 --> 01:47.641
to Seduction Junction
in a while

01:47.675 --> 01:49.210
Oh, no.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.345
Danny, I'm not in the mood.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.780
You're not in the mood?

01:52.813 --> 01:54.515
You're always in the mood,
no matter what.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.250
I mean, after we watched
Schindler's List,

01:56.284 --> 01:57.585
you were, like,
really in the mood.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.752
How 'bout this?

01:58.786 --> 02:00.254
That's a sleeping bag.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.323
You were with me
when I bought that at Target.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.592
It's hot. No?

02:04.625 --> 02:05.593
Yeah.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.495
Oh, God.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.164
(Morgan)
Whoa, whoa, whoa. A tracksuit?

02:10.198 --> 02:11.332
That's my look.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.401
What, are you trying to
Single White Female me?

02:13.434 --> 02:15.536
No, this tracksuit is
the only thing that fits me

02:15.569 --> 02:16.537
in my current state.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.806
I think it's unprofessional.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.308
I hear you, sister,

02:20.341 --> 02:21.575
'cause I don't know
if you guys have noticed,

02:21.609 --> 02:22.610
but I've put on
a little bit of weight

02:22.643 --> 02:25.479
since I started dating
my girlfriend, Jessica.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.447
You know, it's so funny.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.415
When you have a girlfriend,

02:27.448 --> 02:29.683
all you want to do is watch
a chick flick,

02:29.717 --> 02:31.385
and then your girlfriend
comes home and goes,

02:31.419 --> 02:32.653
"Morgan, you fat son
of a bitch, get up"--

02:32.686 --> 02:33.887
(Jeremy)
All right, we get it, Morgan.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.623
I didn't call this meeting
so everyone can

02:35.656 --> 02:36.657
rub their girlfriends
in my face.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.493
I called it because
we need a new staff photo.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.661
- Oh, yeah.
- What?

02:40.694 --> 02:42.530
What's wrong with that photo?
I look so skinny in it.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.398
Half these people don't even
work here anymore.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.799
I, for one,
am sick of staring

02:45.833 --> 02:48.502
at the insufferable smug faces
of our ex-colleagues.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.538
Is this 'cause Dr. P
is marrying your girlfriend?

02:50.571 --> 02:51.705
No, that's ridiculous.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.207
Also, I'm not in the photo.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.875
That's probably for the best.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.211
Well, anyway, prepare
your best American smiles.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.779
- Harry.
- Wait, what?

02:58.812 --> 02:59.980
- Harry.
- What's up, Harry?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.549
- What's up, man?
- What the hell, man?

03:01.582 --> 03:02.650
Get that thing away from me.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.817
I can't be photographed
like this.

03:03.851 --> 03:04.718
- Whoa.
- I need to have therapy.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.387
All right?
I need to get my hair dyed.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.555
I need to get a colonic.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.657
I need to get tasteful
cheek implants if there's time.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.858
Min, pregnant women
can't do that.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.626
The kid will come out
glow-in-the-dark.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.462
Oh, wait, my skinny dress
is at the cleaners.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.230
Can we just wait
so I can go pick that up?

03:16.264 --> 03:17.765
It makes me look hot
no matter what.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.367
Fine, we'll do it tomorrow.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.401
Harry, I'm so sorry.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.535
Oh, thank you.

Thank you so much

03:24.672 --> 03:25.473
for moving me back East

03:25.506 --> 03:26.907
to help out
with the new practice.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.742
I'm just setting up
my new reception desk.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.778
You don't mind if I sell
my rap demos there, right?

03:30.811 --> 03:31.612
Absolutely not.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.414
Rishi, you cannot sell
your single

03:33.447 --> 03:36.550
Ho, It Ain't Mine
at my women's fertility clinic.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.551
- Okay.
- Wait, wait.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.719
Wait. Before you go.

03:41.689 --> 03:42.823
Do I look gross?

03:42.856 --> 03:44.958
Oh, I don't know.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.560
I mean, I knew you
when you had a perm

03:46.594 --> 03:48.929
and overalls on,
and that was nasty, so...

03:48.962 --> 03:51.265
- you look better than that?
- [knocking]

03:51.299 --> 03:53.534
- Hello.
- Uh, hell, no.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.336
[Tamra groans]
Sorry.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.704
Dr. L, I couldn't help
but overhear.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.938
If you're trying to look good,

03:57.971 --> 04:00.308
my cousin Sheena
is an aspiring personal stylist.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.742
I'm just gonna wait
for my skinny dress

04:01.775 --> 04:02.943
to come back
from the dry cleaners.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.445
You should think about it.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.547
Sheena made my next-door
neighbor look hella sexy

04:06.580 --> 04:07.748
at her retirement party,

04:07.781 --> 04:09.617
and my next-door neighbor has
to be weighed at the zoo.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.719
Damn it, Tamra, I can still
be weighed on a human scale.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.721
Think about it.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.857
- Good morning, chums.
- Hey.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.427
How would the two of you
care to accompany me

04:19.460 --> 04:22.029
to a singles pajama party that
my friend is throwing tonight?

04:22.062 --> 04:24.365
- Ooh.
- Oh, tonight I can't.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.533
Ray and I are putting in wiring

04:25.566 --> 04:27.000
in the brownstone
that I'm renovating.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.437
I would love to go
to a singles mixer,

04:29.470 --> 04:31.672
but I don't know if you heard,
I have a girlfriend right now.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.707
You--you're both coming.
Okay, how 'bout that?

04:33.741 --> 04:35.476
Yeah, you're helping me
find a girlfriend.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.677
I'm sick of it, guys.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.078
I'm sick of being
the office pushover

04:38.111 --> 04:39.947
who just turns up
to everybody else's stuff

04:39.980 --> 04:42.450
and allows his colleagues
to marry his girlfriend.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.084
Well, that's it.
No more.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.454
From now on, I'm aggressive,
and I'm confident.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.888
I'm an all-new Jeremy.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.424
You can call me...

Okay...

04:53.661 --> 04:55.463
(both) Jer.
- Wonderful.

04:55.496 --> 04:58.866
Then I'll see you both tonight
at the singles pajama party.

04:58.899 --> 04:59.933
All right, Jer-Bear.

Oh, God.

05:21.121 --> 05:24.324
[quirky music]

05:28.929 --> 05:31.565
but pregnancy is weird
for all women.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.567
My mom actually lost weight
when she was pregnant with me.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.102
Cool origin story.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.104
Hey, we need to start
the beautification process.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.440
On the way over here,
someone called me "sir,"

05:39.473 --> 05:41.008
and another person said,
"Hey, big guy."

05:41.041 --> 05:42.009
Dang.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.110
Where's your cousin?

05:43.143 --> 05:45.012
Somebody looking
for Cousin Sheena?

05:45.045 --> 05:47.448
Oh, my God.
Where did you come from?

05:47.481 --> 05:49.983
In a sense,
I've always been here.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.752
- What?
- She's messing with you.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.421
She snuck in
while you were in the bathroom.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.889
So Tamra tells me
you're pregnant.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.526
You need to be careful.
Babies are shady.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.060
They'll steal your youth
and beauty

06:00.093 --> 06:02.129
and keep it
for their own damn self.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.097
Well, that ship has sailed,
Cousin Sheena.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.566
Where were you
three months ago?

06:05.599 --> 06:06.800
On a cruise.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.002
It's not just the photo.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.971
I don't even want to have sex
with my boyfriend.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.072
How long has it been?

06:12.105 --> 06:13.106
Two weeks.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.743
- [gasps melodramatically]
- Okay.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.912
Tamra, get me my juice.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.715
It's not just that.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.116
I don't feel confident anymore.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.585
You want to know what happened
yesterday?

06:24.618 --> 06:25.986
My butt knocked over
an aquarium.

06:26.019 --> 06:29.457
Mindy, confidence comes from--

06:29.490 --> 06:30.524
From within.
Yeah, I know.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.826
Within?
Who the hell told you that?

06:32.860 --> 06:35.863
Confidence comes from amazing
outfits and perfect makeup.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.566
Listen to her, Dr. L.
She's the expert.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.767
She had to overcome a lot
to be

06:39.800 --> 06:41.502
the beautiful woman
she is today.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.903
Oh, yeah, like what?

06:42.936 --> 06:44.738
Having too hot
a face and body?

06:44.772 --> 06:46.840
Come on.

[hip-hop music playing]

06:52.079 --> 06:53.080
Well, well, well.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.448
A lot of fit birds here.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.717
Time for Jer
to make his move.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.486
(Danny)
This is dumb.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.021
Adults shouldn't have to put on
pajamas to meet each other.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.856
They should just let
their parents introduce them

07:02.890 --> 07:04.458
to their second cousin.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.193
You know, someone who has
the same values they do.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.128
I lo--

07:08.161 --> 07:09.563

Oh, boy.

- Oh, that's Jessica.
- Um...

Oh, man.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.002
- What? What?
- No, no, no.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.169
What do you mean,
"No, no, no"?

07:16.203 --> 07:17.471
- It's not bad.
- No, you're right.

07:17.505 --> 07:18.472
It's not bad.

07:18.506 --> 07:19.473
Maybe it's, like,
her, like,

07:19.507 --> 07:20.741
really hot brother,
you know?

07:20.774 --> 07:21.842
Okay.

07:21.875 --> 07:22.743
Hey, can you go over there

07:22.776 --> 07:24.545
and just kind of
suss out the situation?

07:24.578 --> 07:25.412
Just give me
just a good sussing?

07:25.445 --> 07:26.914
- No. No, Morgan.
- Suss it for me.

07:26.947 --> 07:27.981
I don't want to suss it.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.650
I didn't even want to come here
in the first place.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.552
You hooked us up.
This is your responsibility.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.687
You have to make sure that
her and I are together forever

07:33.721 --> 07:34.822
until we are two skeletons

07:34.855 --> 07:36.123
holding hands
in a couple's grave.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.725
Please.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.060
- Please.
- Okay, fine.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.261
- Thank you.
- Fine, I'll go.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.663
- Okay.
- Just be cool.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.632
I'm gonna be here.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.733
Hey, what's up, Jess?

07:45.766 --> 07:47.200
Oh, h-hey, Danny.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.201
How you doing?

07:48.235 --> 07:49.770
Morgan isn't here,
is he?

07:49.803 --> 07:50.871
Uh, Morgan?

07:50.904 --> 07:52.506
Yeah, I saw him--
I saw him around.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.775
- Oh, cool.
- I think he's hanging out.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.143
Everything all right
with you guys?

07:56.176 --> 07:57.645
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

07:57.678 --> 07:58.612
No, to tell you the truth,

07:58.646 --> 08:02.583
I'm actually thinking
of breaking up with him.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.885
This is gonna sound awful,
but he's really let himself go.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.253
Really?

08:06.286 --> 08:07.888
I didn't even notice that.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.992
Yeah, he's gained,
like, 30 pounds.

08:12.025 --> 08:12.826
Wow.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.162
He brings turkey legs to bed
with him.

08:15.195 --> 08:18.031
Jess, don't--
don't break up with him, okay?

08:18.065 --> 08:19.032
Because...

08:19.066 --> 08:21.602
[sighs]
Because?

08:21.635 --> 08:24.237
Because Jeremy's
gonna fire him tomorrow.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.839
- What?
- Yeah, he's firing him.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.608
- Maybe I should wait.
- Yeah.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.242
You know, sleep on it
for a while.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.277
[sighs]

08:30.310 --> 08:34.014
[quirky music]

08:34.047 --> 08:36.584
Okay, now tell me
what you see.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.252
Two hot black girls
and a fat load in a track suit.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.353
That's cold.

08:40.387 --> 08:43.056
Now, if the person in the mirror
was your best friend,

08:43.090 --> 08:46.126
would you be as mean to her
as you're being to yourself?

08:46.159 --> 08:47.294
No.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.262
Well, I got news for you.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.264
You are talking
to your best friend.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.966
You.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.001
(Mindy and Tamra)
Damn.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.736
Sheena, you're deep as hell.

08:55.769 --> 08:56.837
I know.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.071
I used to work
in a bookstore,

08:58.105 --> 09:00.741
and I read a sentence out of
every single one of them books.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.209
Now, let's get to work.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.276
Strike a pose.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.978
[clears throat]

09:05.012 --> 09:06.346
*

09:06.379 --> 09:08.115
Okay, that gets an A.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.116
Really?

09:09.149 --> 09:11.184
A complete disaster.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.954
Okay, well, I think
you could've just said F then.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.589
You know what?
Let's just not do this anymore.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.090
I'm just gonna look bad
in the photo,

09:17.124 --> 09:18.358
and I'll never have sex again.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.327
You look fine.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.129
It's your attitude
that's terrible.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.832
Now, we all have insecurities
we need to get over.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.233
But you need to own it

09:26.266 --> 09:28.736
and be as confident
and as beautiful

09:28.769 --> 09:30.303
as any other bitch
in the room.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.105
Yeah.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.174
I can be as confident
as any other bitch in the room.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.343
Tamra, go down to my car

09:36.376 --> 09:40.180
and get me Veronica.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.182
Veronica's a push-up bra.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.316
Let me show you
how it's done.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.285
Okay.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.087
Bam. Bam.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.256
[growling]

09:49.289 --> 09:50.290
Now, don't try this.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.324
That baby'll pop
right out of you.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.927
Mm-mm.
I'm owning it.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.696
Owning it.
[hisses]

09:55.729 --> 09:57.164
[hissing]

09:57.197 --> 09:58.699
[screams]

09:58.732 --> 10:00.300
(Jeremy)
The strange thing is,
in England,

10:00.333 --> 10:03.671
it just means "cigarette,"
but here, it's a hate term.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.139
That's so cool
and funny.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.908
- Hey, lady, watch out.
- Excuse me. Hello.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.342
I'm the next-door neighbor.
Oh, good.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.411
You're in your pajamas.
Time for bed.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.847
I've already called the cops.
This party is over now.

10:13.881 --> 10:16.083
- I'm shutting it down.
[all boo]

10:16.116 --> 10:17.084
Was that garbage?
You're garbage!

10:17.117 --> 10:18.085
[stuttering]
Excuse me.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.086
Is there any way
we could just

10:19.119 --> 10:20.120
turn the music down?

10:20.153 --> 10:21.154
It's just--
I'm kind of--

10:21.188 --> 10:22.222
I've come to meet
somebody and--

10:22.255 --> 10:23.223
Aw, did you make a friend?

10:23.256 --> 10:24.758
Tough luck, King's Speech.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.927
I have to wake up
at 3:00 a.m.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.328
with the European markets,

10:28.361 --> 10:30.263
so unless any of you
know how

10:30.297 --> 10:32.165
to stabilize
the Norwegian kroner, then--

10:32.199 --> 10:33.333
What if--
have you thought--

10:33.366 --> 10:35.035
I said "kroner,"
not "cronut," okay?

10:35.068 --> 10:37.938
All of you have to go

10:37.971 --> 10:39.106
right now.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.207
Closing time.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.241
- Bye.
- Come on.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.810
Sorry, Jer.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.177
You know, I know a widow
at my church.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.145
Ooh, widow.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.246
She doesn't speak
any English,

10:46.279 --> 10:48.148
but menopause has really
brought out her inner beauty.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.417
No, Danny, I don't want
your mustachioed widow.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.052
How'd you know
she had a mustache?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.821
How dare she throw us out?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.422
You know, Old Jeremy,
he would have gone home

10:55.455 --> 10:57.024
and taken it out
on his pottery wheel.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.426
But Jer,
he stands up for himself.

10:59.459 --> 11:00.728
Okay.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.230
She's getting
a strongly worded note.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.867
[sensual R&B music playing]

11:06.900 --> 11:07.868
Hey, babe.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.970
(Mindy)
Hey, sweetheart.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.304
Why don't you come
into the bedroom?

11:11.338 --> 11:12.773
I have a little surprise
for you.

11:12.806 --> 11:13.907
I'll give you a hint.

11:13.941 --> 11:17.377
It's curvy, soft, brown,
but it's not a chocolate Santa.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.479
Ooh, la, la.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.480
Daddy like-y.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.183
*

11:23.216 --> 11:24.317
Come here, bad boy.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.420
[laughs]

11:27.454 --> 11:28.989
Oh.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.224
Are you laughing at me?

11:33.761 --> 11:35.328
Danny, I am trying
to be sexy for you,

11:35.362 --> 11:36.930
and you're laughing at me?

11:36.964 --> 11:38.131
I--I--no.
It's funny.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.132
I mean, it's nice.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.433
You are the worst.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.902
I'm sorry. No, I'm not.
I'm--

11:41.935 --> 11:42.903
[grunting quietly]

11:42.936 --> 11:43.771
What are you doing?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.205
Do you need help there,
sweetheart?

11:45.238 --> 11:47.007
I'm fine!

11:47.040 --> 11:49.810
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.078
- Don't follow me in here.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.079
Mindy--
[groans]

11:52.112 --> 11:53.781
Don't change.
Come on.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.048
Come on,
I really like that thing.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.316
It looks like
slutty Spider-Man.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.250
(Mindy)
What?

11:57.284 --> 12:00.020
I don't need you
to try to be sexy for me.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.021
I like how you look.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.890
I just want to have sex.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.993
I am very pent up,
and I'm saying crazy things.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.361
I'm so happy, Danny, that you
would have sex with anything,

12:08.395 --> 12:09.362
even me.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.330
What?

12:10.363 --> 12:12.299
Babe, I know you're not
feeling it right now,

12:12.332 --> 12:14.001
but eventually,
you're gonna lose the weight,

12:14.034 --> 12:15.002
and you're gonna look great.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.003
Will I?

12:16.036 --> 12:17.004
Since I was 15 years old,

12:17.037 --> 12:19.172
I've been saying
I'll lose weight and feel great.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.307
I don't know
if it's gonna happen, Danny.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.508
It never has before.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.177
I mean, I guess there was
that one time on spring break

12:24.211 --> 12:26.546
when I accidentally had
that Cancun puddle water.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.381
Ugh.
But that doesn't count.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.817
It was diarrhea weight.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.251
Mindy, I don't care
what you look like.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.385
To me,
you're always beautiful.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.888
And that outfit right now?
You should put that back on.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.990
- That was really hot.
- [spits]

12:37.024 --> 12:40.027
Danny, I care what I look like,
and it doesn't help

12:40.060 --> 12:42.162
that I'm dating someone who's
so much better-looking than me.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.964
What?
What are you talking about?

12:43.997 --> 12:44.965
That's not true.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.800
It is true.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.036
And now I'm pregnant,
it's just gonna get worse.

12:49.069 --> 12:49.870
- No.
- Yes.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.438
And you're gonna get
hotter and hotter

12:51.471 --> 12:52.439
like George Clooney.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.841
I'm gonna get fatter
and fatter

12:53.874 --> 12:55.175
like Rosemary Clooney.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.244
Excuse me?
Rosemary Clooney?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.246
She's very sexy, Mindy.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.114
Did you ever listen
to Mambo Italiano?

13:01.148 --> 13:02.349
That is a hot song, babe.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.350
You want me to put it on?

13:03.383 --> 13:05.018
Ugh, I just want to sleep.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.453
Maybe in my dream
I'll be skinny.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.587
Okay, fine.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.991
[quirky music]

13:11.024 --> 13:12.059
Dr. L, what's up?

13:12.092 --> 13:13.593
Why are you back
in the tracksuit?

13:13.626 --> 13:16.196
Look, I appreciate what you and
Sheena were trying to do for me,

13:16.229 --> 13:17.197
but it's hopeless.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.265
When Danny saw me last night,

13:18.298 --> 13:19.466
he laughed.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.534
When you presented yourself
for sex?

13:21.568 --> 13:24.604
No, it is never okay for a man
to laugh at a woman.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.373
I don't care
if he's at a Mo'Nique show,

13:26.406 --> 13:27.941
he better politely smile
and nod.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.210
I had a back wedgie
and a front wedgie.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.211
Uh-uh, this is sexist,
it's--

13:31.244 --> 13:33.313
Everybody, chop, chop.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.182
Come on.
The photographer's here.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.984
I'm going to opt out
of the photo.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.418
Mindy, you're coming, okay?

13:38.451 --> 13:41.054
Put down the pie,
and let's go.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.923
What are we waiting for?

13:42.956 --> 13:45.058
I got something bleached
for this.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.393
I'll be in the picture,
Dr. Reed,

13:46.426 --> 13:48.195
but not if this man is.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.496
Why are you mad at me?

13:49.529 --> 13:51.464
For the last time,
I didn't call you "sister."

13:51.498 --> 13:53.300
I said you look like
Sister Joyce from church.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.567
(Jeremy)
Everybody's gonna be
in this photo

13:54.601 --> 13:56.069
whether they like it or not.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.170
Who are we waiting for?

13:57.204 --> 13:59.572
I got something bleached
for this.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.008
You already said that.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.475
Well, I guess
I'm not in the staff photo.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.443
What now?

14:03.476 --> 14:06.079
Dr. C told Jessica
that you were gonna fire me,

14:06.113 --> 14:07.014
and then she dumped me.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.216
If I didn't fire you
for kissing that baby

14:09.249 --> 14:11.351
before it was fully out,
I'm not gonna fire you now.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.320
- Thank you.
- Why did she break up with you?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.487
She wasn't
supposed to do that.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.356
What the hell
are you talking about?

14:16.389 --> 14:19.059
Look, I told Jessica
that Jeremy was gonna fire you

14:19.092 --> 14:20.928
because she was gonna dump you.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.595
I was just trying
to buy you some time.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.364
Why would she dump me?

14:24.397 --> 14:27.200
Was she intimidated
by my "intelli-gince"?

14:27.234 --> 14:28.268
Who knows? Maybe.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.269
Wait.
Danny's lying.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.204
His lips are poutier than normal
when he lies.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.072
(Morgan)
What?

14:32.105 --> 14:33.440
Can I talk to you alone
in my office?

14:33.473 --> 14:35.075
- No, you cannot.
- Fine.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.310
Jessica said she was gonna
break up with you

14:37.344 --> 14:38.578
because you were
gaining weight.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.948
What the hell
are you talking about, dude?

14:40.981 --> 14:43.516
Well, you--you have been
getting a little heavy, right?

14:43.550 --> 14:45.152
(both)
What?

14:45.185 --> 14:46.987
- What?
- Oh, no.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.321
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.222
(Morgan)
No, sir.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.624
You have some nerve
fat-shaming Morgan

14:51.658 --> 14:52.625
for being fat.

14:52.659 --> 14:53.560
I'm just the messenger.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.195
Why is everybody yelling at me
right now?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.363
You know what, I knew
this was gonna happen,

14:56.396 --> 14:59.532
because Jessica is a hot doctor,
and I'm just some fat slob

14:59.566 --> 15:02.135
who lost his life savings
to a teenage grifter

15:02.169 --> 15:03.203
who said he could cast spells.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.072
Never play above the rim
is what I've learned today.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.473
It's an important lesson.
Thank you for that.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.607
Morgan, no.
Don't feel that way.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.710
We cannot let the Dannys
and the Jessicas of the world

15:10.743 --> 15:12.479
make us feel less than

15:12.512 --> 15:14.181
just because we don't have
thigh gaps.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.348
I actually do have
one of those.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.616
That's obviously not true.

15:16.649 --> 15:17.617
We're out of here.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.086
Mindy? Mindy.
Morgan.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.188
I guess the photo's
not happening.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.189
(Danny)
I'm sorry, guys.

15:22.222 --> 15:25.058
I wasn't fat-shaming anyone.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.228
Dr. Reed,
can I ask you a question?

15:28.261 --> 15:29.963
I need to take this year off.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.965
No more questions today,
Beverly.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.366
(Whitney)
Well, I have a question.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.635
Who the hell do you think
you are?

15:35.668 --> 15:37.704
Got your little note.

15:37.737 --> 15:41.074
"You have the manners
of a Blackpool dockjob"?

15:41.108 --> 15:43.143
What the hell
does that even mean?

15:43.176 --> 15:46.446
It's like a Tynemouth stevedore
only ruder.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.081
I'm nothing like a stevedore.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.182
Good shot.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.717
You're gonna apologize
to me right now.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.152
I will not.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.320
If you'd look
to the bottom of the note,

15:53.353 --> 15:56.356
you would see that it says,
"Good day."

15:56.389 --> 15:57.390
Good day.

15:59.759 --> 16:03.997
Don't let him talk to you
like that, Dr. L.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.498
- Excuse me.
- Mm.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.733
You can't talk to me
like that.

16:06.766 --> 16:10.037
I am the highest female earner
on Wall Street--non-Jewish.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.504
Excuse me,
I have a delivery.

16:11.538 --> 16:12.672
That's too bad,

16:12.705 --> 16:15.108
because I have more yelling
to do.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.144
Well, you're not wasting
any more of my work day.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.645
You can meet me for dinner
tonight.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.347
- Fine.
- I'll pick you up at 8:00.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.350
No, I will pick you up
at 8:00.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.085
Fine.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.620
Fine.

16:27.654 --> 16:31.091
By God, Jer, you've done it.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.659

16:38.731 --> 16:39.932
(Danny)
Oh, boy.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.535
How dare you laugh at your
beautiful, pregnant girlfriend?

16:42.569 --> 16:43.803
You should be worshipping
the ground

16:43.836 --> 16:45.172
her swollen feet stomp on.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.140
Cool it, T.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.375
That's your boss.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.676
Yeah, I'm your boss.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.778
- But he's not mine.
- Oh.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.381
Mine is Mr. Reyes
at the limo company.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.548
I don't know him.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.484
You better make things right
with Mindy,

16:57.517 --> 16:59.686
or I will devastate
your self-confidence.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.688
(Tamra)
She ain't playing, Dr. C.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.224
Sheena tears people down just
as good as she builds them up.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.259
She made Chris Christie cry
at a parade.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.128
I tell Mindy she's beautiful
all the time,

17:08.161 --> 17:09.396
but she doesn't believe me.

17:09.429 --> 17:13.100
A real man
makes her believe it.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.568
She's building a whole baby
in there.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.405
Making her feel pretty
is your only damn job.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.341
Okay, well, how--
how do I do it?

17:21.374 --> 17:25.445
Tonight, I want you
to look her in her eyes

17:25.478 --> 17:28.081
and tell her the most
beautiful thing about her.

17:28.115 --> 17:31.751
Like this.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.420
- Danny.
- Yeah?

17:33.453 --> 17:35.355
You're a beautiful man.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.856
Thank you so much.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.825
But the most beautiful thing
about you

17:38.858 --> 17:40.560
is your heart.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.598
Oh, God.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.567
That's good.
That's real good.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.169
I'm done.

17:49.202 --> 17:52.839
[quirky music]

17:52.872 --> 17:54.241
Bye, Felicia.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.609
Oh, no, don't give me
the "bye, Felicia."

17:58.511 --> 18:00.347
- [yelps]
- Okay, Jessica.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.481
Jessica, we need to talk.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.416
- Oh. Hey, you know what?
- Whoa.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.152
I thought you got your hoarding
under control.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.153
What?
[laughs]

18:06.186 --> 18:07.053
What are you talking about?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.621
This is just stuff that
I really need.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.258
Hey, why are you guys wearing
matching tracksuits?

18:11.291 --> 18:13.426
What? No, we're not.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.162
Do you like it?
I thought it could be fun.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.829
Are you kidding? We came here
to make an impressio--

18:16.863 --> 18:18.665
Okay, it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.233
You cannot just break up
with someone

18:20.267 --> 18:21.234
because he got fat.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.802
Hey, fat-boned.
Sorry.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.137
Hey, Mindy, are you okay?

18:24.171 --> 18:26.506
You don't look so good.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.176
Oh, no, you did not.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.210
Now you made her mad.

18:32.745 --> 18:33.913
Not my coaxial cables.
[groans]

18:33.946 --> 18:35.382
There's more where that
came from, sister.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.150
Oh, what,
so because I'm a hoarder,

18:37.184 --> 18:38.585
I have to put up
with someone who--

18:38.618 --> 18:39.719
let's be honest--

18:39.752 --> 18:41.254
has become
a little bit of a tub?

18:41.288 --> 18:42.722
- Oh!
- Oh, you did not!

18:42.755 --> 18:44.191
[Morgan and Jessica groaning]

18:44.224 --> 18:45.592
- Oh, God.
- [groans]

18:45.625 --> 18:46.793
You know what else?

18:46.826 --> 18:47.927
- Ooh!
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.229
Not my old candy wrappers.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.563
You cherish these?

18:50.597 --> 18:51.764
- Oh.
- Say good-bye!

18:51.798 --> 18:53.633
Okay, we'll get back together.
Okay, okay.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.402
We'll get back together.
Whatever it takes.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.336
Please, Mindy, just stop.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.405
So now you want
to get back together, huh?

18:58.438 --> 19:00.240
- Guess what. You can't.
- No, no, no, no, no.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.474
'Cause he doesn't want you back.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.942
No, I do. We can.
We're back in love.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.244
It's all fine.
This was a wash.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.245
No, you're not.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.246
You know what, Jessica?

19:06.279 --> 19:07.714
Morgan might not be perfect,

19:07.747 --> 19:09.449
and he might never be perfect,

19:09.482 --> 19:10.617
but he's a good guy.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.851
He's a caring guy.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.520
He's healthy, and--

19:13.553 --> 19:14.554
Well, I--
not really healthy.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.390
I have this wound on my gut
that won't close up.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.793
The point is, he's beautiful,
and he's strong,

19:20.827 --> 19:24.497
even if he himself
can't see it right now.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.865
God.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.434
How can I say this about Morgan,

19:27.467 --> 19:28.868
who's basically
a lowly dirt man,

19:28.901 --> 19:30.737
but I can't say it
about myself?

19:30.770 --> 19:31.771
Sheena was right.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.940
I'm sorry, am I beautiful,
or am I a dirt man?

19:33.973 --> 19:35.675
- Why am I getting so mad
at Danny?
- Which one is it?

19:35.708 --> 19:36.809
How are you not answering--

19:36.843 --> 19:38.945
Danny would never try to
judge me or break up with me.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.414
He just told me he loved me
no matter what.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.283
You know what, you guys?
Just go.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.952

Hasta la vista.

19:45.985 --> 19:46.953
(Danny)
Hey, babe.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.656
I left a little early,
made some dinner for us.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.625
God, you're so nice.

19:52.659 --> 19:56.329
Hey, I want to apologize
to you for acting so crazy.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.399
It was wrong of me
to be angry with you.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.534
I realized the only person
that can make you feel better

20:01.568 --> 20:03.403
about yourself is yourself.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.838
Or, like, a gay hairdresser
named LaChiquito,

20:05.872 --> 20:08.007
but, I mean, how would I
even find that guy?

20:08.040 --> 20:12.812
No, a real man
makes his woman feel beautiful.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.848
Ooh, I like how urban
you're being right now.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.586
And the thing
that's most beautiful about you

20:19.619 --> 20:21.020
is your confidence.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.555
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:22.589 --> 20:23.790
'Cause everyone
I've ever met

20:23.823 --> 20:25.692
says it's the most annoying
thing about me.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.860
For me, I mean--
I don't know.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.398
Maybe I'm crazy,
but it really turns me on.

Well, I'm not gonna say
that I'm prettier than Gisele,

20:35.001 --> 20:36.669
but there is a quality
in my face

20:36.703 --> 20:38.405
that I think is
kind of more appealing.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.939
There it is.
I like that.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.342
And I'm really smart
at the news.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.410
Yeah, you are.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.977
I can tell you
all about Iraq

20:45.011 --> 20:47.480
and Iranistan.

- Just no one asks me...
- Shut up, shut up.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.483
Because they think
I'm too cute.

20:50.517 --> 20:51.684
Shut up.

if Mindy and I, we just--

21:00.360 --> 21:01.694
we hang out over here
for the picture?

21:01.728 --> 21:02.529
Sure.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.063
And I thought
it would be kind of cool

21:04.096 --> 21:06.399
if he held my breasts
like Janet Jackson.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.635
Harry, I'm just gonna kind of
linger in the back, okay?

21:08.668 --> 21:10.370
I'm a little self-conscious
about my body.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.705
I think you look good.
Fat guys are sexy.

in the wintertime
