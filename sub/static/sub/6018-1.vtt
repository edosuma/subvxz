00:02.553 --> 00:06.896
I've always wondered why baseball
is so associated with sex.

00:07.073 --> 00:10.509
"He's playing the field. He scored.
He didn't get to first base."

00:10.677 --> 00:12.440
"I struck out." "Why?"
"She wanted a diamond."

00:12.612 --> 00:16.548
It's always baseball,
always baseball.

00:16.716 --> 00:20.345
As far as baseball goes,
I prefer the fat umpires.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.579
If you're on the field
and not in the game...

00:22.756 --> 00:26.385
...you should be in the worst physical
condition a human could be in.

00:26.559 --> 00:29.960
They should be allowed
to eat during the game.

00:30.997 --> 00:34.091
We're too into sports in this country.
We gotta throttle back.

00:34.267 --> 00:35.962
People come home
from these games:

00:36.136 --> 00:39.663
"We won, we won!"
No, they won, you watched.

00:44.911 --> 00:49.348
Okay, Danny. Take a swing.
No, no, no.

00:49.516 --> 00:51.814
-You're opening up your shoulder.
-Really?

00:51.985 --> 00:56.012
No, not really. I'm just saying this to
you because I like to hear myself talk.

00:56.189 --> 00:57.781
Yes, really.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.618
All right, all right.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.728
-What are you all sweating for?
-It's hot in this uniform.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.960
-Hot? What is this?
-What is what?

01:07.133 --> 01:09.033
This uniform. What's it made from?

01:09.202 --> 01:11.227
-I don't know. Cotton?
-No. No, no.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.099
This is not cotton. Here, let me see.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.298
-What are you doing?
-I wanna see the label.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.500
Will you stop it? Come on.

01:18.578 --> 01:22.241
-Oh, of course. Polyester!
-So?

01:22.415 --> 01:25.350
-I can't believe you're not in cotton.
-This is what they give us.

01:25.518 --> 01:28.351
You know they used to make
leisure suits out of this fabric?

01:28.521 --> 01:30.921
-You really think cotton is better?
-Of course.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.184
All right, maybe I'll say
something to Buck.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.960
-Yeah, good idea. Catch you later.
-Yeah.

01:37.130 --> 01:38.722
Hey, don't embarrass me today.

01:38.898 --> 01:41.332
I got some friends in the stands.

01:46.739 --> 01:49.333
-Hot dogs here. Yankee franks.
-Oh, you want one?

01:49.509 --> 01:50.737
-Yeah.
-I'll get it.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.207
-I got it.
-Jerry.

01:52.378 --> 01:54.744
-Elaine, stop it.
-Just because I'm not working...

01:54.914 --> 01:57.781
...doesn't mean I don't have
any money. Yo. Dogs. Two.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.543
All right. I'm sorry.

01:59.719 --> 02:02.279
<i>Your attention, please.
The New York Yankees...</i>

02:02.455 --> 02:05.754
<i>...would like to welcome
Miss Connecticut...</i>

02:05.925 --> 02:09.691
<i>...Miss Rhode Island
and Miss North Dakota.</i>

02:09.863 --> 02:14.061
<i>All of whom will be competing
in the Miss America pageant...</i>

02:14.234 --> 02:18.398
<i>... this weekend in Atlantic City.</i>

02:18.571 --> 02:21.768
Now, there's a career path
you may have overlooked.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.035
Oh, I gotta check my machine. I'm
waiting to hear about an interview.

02:25.211 --> 02:29.409
Doubleday is looking for somebody
to replace Jackie Onassis.

02:29.582 --> 02:31.982
-She worked at Doubleday?
-Yeah, she was an editor.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.915
-Oh, right, just like you.
-Yeah.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.520
-Would you move your feet?
-Yeah.

02:35.688 --> 02:39.124
-Hey, lady!
-Hey, down in front!

02:39.292 --> 02:42.056
-Hey!
-Move your feet.

02:42.629 --> 02:45.359
-I'm going.
-Come on.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.929
-Hot dog?
-No, thanks.

02:50.103 --> 02:53.334
-I'm watching my weight.
-I'm watching my height.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.202
My doctor doesn't want me
to get any taller.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.669
-So you're Miss...?
-Rhode Island.

03:00.847 --> 03:04.715
I was almost Mr. Coffee.
They felt I was a little too relaxed.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.348
Miss Rhode Island?

03:09.022 --> 03:11.456
-When are you seeing her?
-Tonight. I have to call her.

03:11.624 --> 03:13.182
She's staying in a hotel.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.259
-You're incredible.
-And get this:

03:15.428 --> 03:17.362
I'm working Atlantic City
this weekend.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.361
She's gonna be there
for the pageant.

03:19.532 --> 03:23.866
What if she becomes Miss America?
You could be dating Miss America.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.562
The only bad thing is we have
to go out with a chaperone.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.730
Chaperone? What, are you kidding?

03:28.908 --> 03:31.570
-No. It's the contest rules.
-What does the chaperone do?

03:31.744 --> 03:34.212
I don't know. She just sits there.

03:35.515 --> 03:39.542
-Can she talk?
-I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk.

03:40.153 --> 03:42.348
-Are you calling her?
-Yeah.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.088
Yes. Room 417, please.
Karen Hanson.

03:49.262 --> 03:52.493
Hey, did you know the Yankees
don't wear cotton jerseys?

03:52.665 --> 03:54.257
Of course. They're polyester.

03:54.434 --> 03:57.232
Well, what is that? That's a crime.

03:57.403 --> 04:00.395
You know how hot those things get?
They should be wearing cotton.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.905
-Why do they wear polyester?
-I don't know.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.600
That's all gonna change.

04:06.379 --> 04:09.109
-You're gonna do something about it?
-Why shouldn't l?

04:10.550 --> 04:12.415
No reason.

04:15.989 --> 04:19.481
Of course, Jackie O
was a great lady.

04:19.659 --> 04:22.719
Those are gonna be
some tough shoes to fill.

04:22.895 --> 04:25.193
Everyone loved her.

04:25.365 --> 04:27.060
She had such...

04:27.233 --> 04:30.100
-...grace.
-Yes!

04:32.105 --> 04:35.165
-Grace!
-Not many people have grace.

04:36.042 --> 04:38.636
Well, you know,
grace is a tough one.

04:38.811 --> 04:40.904
I like to think I have a little grace.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.311
-Not as much as Jackie O, but--
-You can't have a little grace.

04:44.484 --> 04:48.545
You either have grace
or you don't.

04:50.256 --> 04:53.623
Okay, fine. I have no grace.

04:54.861 --> 04:57.056
And you can't acquire grace.

04:57.230 --> 05:00.688
Well, I have no intention
of getting grace.

05:00.867 --> 05:04.132
Grace isn't something
you can pick up at the market.

05:04.304 --> 05:08.331
All right, look. I don't have grace,
I don't want grace...

05:08.508 --> 05:11.068
...I don't even say grace, okay?

05:13.913 --> 05:16.677
-Thank you for coming in.
-Yeah, yeah, right.

05:18.551 --> 05:22.681
We'll make our choice in a few days
and we'll let you know.

05:22.855 --> 05:25.722
-I have no chance, do l?
-No.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.621
All right. Thanks.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.625
Justin Pitt to see you.

05:29.796 --> 05:32.822
-Justin Pitt?
-He was a very close friend...

05:32.999 --> 05:34.261
...of Mrs. Onassis'.

05:34.434 --> 05:37.267
Mrs. Onassis'.
That's hard to pronounce.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.201
-Excuse me?
-Nothing, nothing.

05:40.373 --> 05:43.274
Mrs. Landis, there's something
wrong with this copying machine.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.070
It's all coming out slanted.

05:45.244 --> 05:48.907
Now, I don't know if this
is your department or not.

05:49.082 --> 05:52.415
Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.583
Charmed.

06:01.260 --> 06:06.254
I was a great admirer
of Mrs. Onassis.

06:08.634 --> 06:11.933
Hello, Karen?
Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.868
Oh, that's very sweet of you.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.565
You better be careful.
You don't wanna get too congenial.

06:16.743 --> 06:19.143
They'll slap that
Miss Congeniality on you...

06:19.312 --> 06:22.713
...you'll congenial yourself
right out of the contest.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.182
So, what time
you wanna get together later?

06:27.587 --> 06:28.986
What?

06:29.155 --> 06:31.089
So what?
We don't need the chaperone.

06:31.257 --> 06:32.485
Her chaperone can't make it.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.761
Oh, you're not
gonna get disqualified.

06:36.929 --> 06:38.954
So we're not going?

06:39.866 --> 06:42.061
Come on.
Hold on one second.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.567
-Hey, what are you doing tonight?
-Nothing.

06:45.671 --> 06:48.299
I'm going out with a Miss America
contestant. You wanna go?

06:48.474 --> 06:50.669
What state?

06:54.180 --> 06:55.442
Rhode Island.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.412
They're never in contention.

06:58.651 --> 06:59.982
How do you know?

07:00.153 --> 07:03.179
Because I've seen every
Miss America pageant since I was 6.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.415
Do you wanna go or not?
I'll buy you dinner.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.253
-Giddyup.
-I think I got someone.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.267
The resemblance is uncanny.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.096
Even the brown eyes.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.108
Well, a lot of people
have brown eyes.

07:25.278 --> 07:30.079
No, there's something else.
An indefinable quality.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.383
Grace?

07:32.885 --> 07:34.216
Grace, yes.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.453
You think I have grace?

07:38.024 --> 07:40.993
-Some grace, yes.
-Just some?

07:41.160 --> 07:44.129
Well, you don't want too much grace,
or you won't be able to stand.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.059
Oh, Mr. Pitt.

07:51.204 --> 07:55.800
Elaine, I want you to come and work
for me as my personal assistant.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.136
Now, I'll pay you the same
as Pendant...

07:58.311 --> 08:01.246
...but I would need you
to start right away.

08:05.518 --> 08:08.009
Hey, Buck.
Talk to you for a second?

08:08.187 --> 08:10.212
Sure, George.

08:10.389 --> 08:12.357
How's everything going?
Everything okay?

08:12.525 --> 08:15.983
Well, all of a sudden, there's a
problem with Tartabull's swing, but...

08:18.431 --> 08:21.161
Listen, Buck, obviously
I don't need to talk to you...

08:21.334 --> 08:24.826
...about the importance
of player morale.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.938
But I've been talking
to some of the guys...

08:27.106 --> 08:30.837
...I don't wanna mention any names,
but some of them aren't too happy...

08:31.010 --> 08:33.376
...with the polyester uniforms.

08:33.546 --> 08:37.038
-How so?
-They get very hot in the polyester.

08:37.216 --> 08:39.548
It's not a natural fiber.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.210
I think they would prefer cotton.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.089
-Cotton, huh?
-Cotton breathes.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.352
See, it's much softer.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.825
Imagine playing games...

08:49.996 --> 08:52.521
...and your team is 5 degrees cooler
than the other team.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.563
Don't you think
that would be an advantage?

08:54.734 --> 08:57.567
They're cooler, they're more
comfortable, they're happier...

08:57.737 --> 08:59.068
...they're gonna play better.

08:59.238 --> 09:03.038
-You may have something there.
-Oh, I've got something.

09:04.143 --> 09:06.134
Cotton uniforms.

09:07.246 --> 09:08.645
Congratulations.

09:08.814 --> 09:12.875
Yeah. And the best part is
I still get to look for work in publishing.

09:13.052 --> 09:17.148
-Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
-I attend to his personal affairs.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.551
Like what?

09:20.393 --> 09:23.419
Well, like tomorrow,
for example, l...

09:23.829 --> 09:27.287
-I have to buy him some socks.
-Really?

09:27.466 --> 09:29.457
-Socks.
-Yeah.

09:29.635 --> 09:31.626
White ones.
The ones you wear with sneakers.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.635
Maybe you could pick me up
some underwear.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.404
So, what do you think?
Does this work?

09:40.012 --> 09:42.503
Listen, tonight,
after we finish eating...

09:42.682 --> 09:44.809
...you make like you got
something else to do...

09:44.984 --> 09:47.418
...and recede into the night,
if you know what I mean.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.578
No way.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.550
-What?
-lf you think I'm gonna step aside...

09:52.725 --> 09:54.989
...while you defile this woman,
you're crazy.

09:55.161 --> 09:57.356
I'm not going to defile her.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.760
Right, because I'm gonna see
it doesn't happen.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.866
These girls are
Miss America contestants.

10:02.034 --> 10:03.501
It's every little girl's dream.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.534
I'm not gonna let you
trample that dream...

10:05.705 --> 10:08.401
...and make a mockery
of everything the pageant stands for.

10:08.574 --> 10:10.633
No buts.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.368
-Those are my rules.
-Wait a minute.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.708
If you wanna have some good,
wholesome fun with a nice girl...

10:15.881 --> 10:18.611
...I'll help you out.
If you're looking for something more...

10:18.784 --> 10:20.809
-...you got the wrong guy, buddy.
-It's just--

10:26.459 --> 10:27.790
If you were Miss America...

10:27.960 --> 10:31.361
...what would you do to make
the world a better place?

10:32.598 --> 10:34.463
As Miss America...

10:34.634 --> 10:38.229
...I would try and bring an end
to world hunger.

10:38.404 --> 10:40.838
If every person sacrificed
one meal a week...

10:41.007 --> 10:43.999
...there would be enough
to feed the whole world.

10:44.176 --> 10:46.144
That's a hell of a plan. Listen--

10:46.312 --> 10:48.337
What advice
would you give young people?

10:48.514 --> 10:49.913
All right, Kramer.

10:50.082 --> 10:53.074
This is important. She's gotta be able
to answer these questions.

10:53.252 --> 10:56.949
She's not gonna have time to think
with millions of people watching her.

10:57.123 --> 11:00.354
Any hesitation could cost her
the crown. You know, poise counts.

11:00.526 --> 11:03.154
-You really know a lot about this.
-Yeah, like last year...

11:03.329 --> 11:04.956
...Miss Texas
should have won easily.

11:05.131 --> 11:07.429
But she lost points
in the swimsuit competition.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.091
-What could she have done?
-Tape her breasts together.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.207
-What else?
-All right, take you for example.

11:17.376 --> 11:19.708
Now, you're very attractive,
but you got a big waist.

11:19.879 --> 11:22.871
-Hey, come on!
-No, no, no, it's okay.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.040
-Go on.
-Well...

11:25.217 --> 11:27.048
...I'd recommend a waist cincher.

11:27.219 --> 11:30.586
-Really?
-Oh, yeah. Just...suck you in.

11:30.756 --> 11:33.554
All right. I'll be right back.

11:36.228 --> 11:39.061
-So, what's your talent?
-Magic.

11:39.231 --> 11:41.597
I'm thinking of a number
from one to 10.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.463
Six.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.194
No, five.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.362
But you were close.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.902
<i>And the Yankees take the field.</i>

11:50.076 --> 11:53.307
<i>Is it my imagination or the Yankees
look a little different tonight?</i>

11:53.479 --> 11:56.039
<i>-I can't put my finger on it.
-From what I understand...</i>

11:56.215 --> 11:57.842
<i>... they switched to cotton uniforms.</i>

11:58.017 --> 12:00.451
<i>Well, they say it's softer.</i>

12:00.619 --> 12:03.315
<i>Well, it is a natural fiber.</i>

12:05.725 --> 12:06.953
How's your eveningwear?

12:07.727 --> 12:09.991
-Well, I'm wearing this red--
-Stop right there.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.390
-No good?
-Disaster.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.759
-Why?
-Well, you got brown eyes.

12:13.933 --> 12:18.597
-You wanna wear a green dress.
-That makes sense.

12:19.972 --> 12:22.270
Well, here we are.

12:22.441 --> 12:27.936
Kramer, would you consider being my
personal consultant for the pageant?

12:29.815 --> 12:32.477
Okay. But if I'm gonna do this...

12:32.651 --> 12:34.915
...we play by my rules
or we don't play at all.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.078
I am in your hands.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.752
Well...

12:41.927 --> 12:43.918
Good night, Jerry.

12:50.236 --> 12:52.602
-Kenneth will take you home.
-Yeah.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.403
Oh, shut the **** up.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.990
-Hey.
-Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.

13:17.163 --> 13:18.494
Oh, come on.

13:18.664 --> 13:21.155
And that waist cincher,
that was the topper.

13:21.333 --> 13:26.066
-Oh, you're pooh-poohing?
-Yes, I pooh-pooh.

13:26.238 --> 13:27.830
Well, let me tell you something.

13:28.007 --> 13:30.976
I'm taking this kid to the top.
To the top, Jerry.

13:31.143 --> 13:34.078
We're going for the crown,
and you can't stop her.

13:34.246 --> 13:37.215
-I don't wanna stop her.
-You can't stop her, Jerry!

13:37.383 --> 13:41.149
Oh, I've seen them come and go,
but this kid has got something.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.582
Yeah, so do you.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.525
-Well, did you see it?
-See what?

13:46.692 --> 13:49.092
The uniforms!
Did you see how they played?

13:49.261 --> 13:52.856
Listen to these comments.
"Wade Boggs, 'What a fabric.

13:53.032 --> 13:55.296
Finally, we can breathe.'

13:55.467 --> 13:58.129
Luis Polonia, 'Cotton is king.'

13:58.304 --> 14:02.764
Paul O'Neill, 'l never dreamed
anything could be so soft and fluffy.'"

14:04.743 --> 14:07.439
-Boy, they really sound comfortable.
-Hey, where you going?

14:07.613 --> 14:09.308
-I'm working Atlantic City.
-Really?

14:09.481 --> 14:11.779
Hey, you're not working.
Why don't you come down.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.816
Atlantic City?

14:13.986 --> 14:15.613
Yes. Yes.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.552
I will go to Atlantic City.
I'm in. I'm down.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.115
Maybe Elaine wants to go too.
Let me call her.

14:21.293 --> 14:23.284
She's at Mr. Pitt's.
I think I got the number.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.720
So, what do you think?

14:29.201 --> 14:31.032
-No.
-What--?

14:31.203 --> 14:33.933
-You don't like them?
-No, I don't like them.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.498
-What's wrong?
-They're too tight.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.576
-Too tight?
-There's no elastic.

14:39.745 --> 14:42.111
You need to pull too much.

14:42.281 --> 14:43.714
I think they look good.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.477
They're cutting off the circulation.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.552
All right. I'll take them back.

14:52.691 --> 14:56.457
-Hello?
-Hi, Mr. Pitt. Is Elaine there?

15:00.266 --> 15:02.097
It's for you.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.331
Sorry.

15:05.504 --> 15:08.166
-Hello?
-Hey, Elaine, it's me.

15:08.340 --> 15:11.275
-Jerry.
-Yeah. We're going to Atlantic City.

15:11.443 --> 15:15.539
-Really? When?
-Today. Right now. You in?

15:17.116 --> 15:19.448
One second, one second.
Hang on, hang on.

15:20.085 --> 15:25.352
Excuse me, Mr. Pitt. Would it be
all right if I got the socks tomorrow?

15:25.958 --> 15:27.858
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

15:28.027 --> 15:31.258
I was hoping
for my new socks today.

15:31.430 --> 15:36.732
-Well, it's just one more day.
-I'm sorry. I must have them today.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.375
I can't go.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.969
-Why not?
-Because I have to return the socks...

15:48.147 --> 15:51.173
-...and get different ones.
-Elaine!

15:51.350 --> 15:53.113
I gotta go.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.118
No.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.754
All right, watch me.

16:11.036 --> 16:13.368
Turn. Back.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.507
Head up. Shoulders back.

16:15.674 --> 16:19.542
-Posture. See? Posture.
-Yes, I see. Okay.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.137
All right, let's try
a few more questions. All right?

16:24.683 --> 16:27.652
"lf you were Miss America
and the U.S. was on the brink...

16:27.820 --> 16:31.256
...of a nuclear war and the only way
the conflict could be averted...

16:31.423 --> 16:34.756
...was if you agreed to sleep
with the enemy's leader...

16:35.361 --> 16:36.589
...what would you do?"

16:36.762 --> 16:38.957
Kramer, are these questions
really that important?

16:39.131 --> 16:40.826
Yes, they're important!

16:41.000 --> 16:44.492
If you stumble, if you hesitate,
you can kiss the crown goodbye.

16:44.670 --> 16:49.232
Now, if I told you once, I've told you
a thousand times, poise counts!

16:49.408 --> 16:51.501
It's just as important
as the others.

16:51.677 --> 16:56.478
Swimsuit, eveningwear,
talent, poise!

16:59.485 --> 17:01.851
-Hey. How was the show?
-Good. How was roulette?

17:02.021 --> 17:05.752
I won 50 bucks. This is great.
Too bad Elaine's not here.

17:05.924 --> 17:08.950
Yeah. All she had to do
was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.357
-It's good, but--
-But what?

17:12.531 --> 17:16.365
-Ultimately, I don't think they'll stay up.
-No. No, they'll stay up.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.400
For a while, yes,
but not in the long run.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.663
But that's why I got you
the tighter ones.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.433
Forget about those!

17:23.709 --> 17:26.609
-Why do you keep mentioning those?
-What do you want?

17:26.779 --> 17:29.145
I want a decent sock
that's comfortable...

17:29.314 --> 17:30.941
...that will stay on my foot!

17:45.431 --> 17:49.424
-What the hell is that?
-I don't know. It sounds like pigeons.

17:50.169 --> 17:52.535
-Well, I can't sleep with that noise.
-Me either.

17:52.704 --> 17:55.502
Is there anything you can do
to shut them up?

17:55.674 --> 17:57.665
Wait a second.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.771
This will scare them off.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.890
-Well, good night, Ollie.
-Good night, Stan.

18:19.798 --> 18:22.733
-What is it?
-My doves. They're dead.

18:22.901 --> 18:25.062
I trained those birds for eight years.

18:25.237 --> 18:27.262
How am I supposed to do
my magic act now?

18:27.439 --> 18:29.430
-How did this happen?
-They like it outside...

18:29.608 --> 18:31.599
...so I kept them in a cage
on the terrace...

18:31.777 --> 18:34.803
...then I found them dead
in a pool of water.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.847
-But how did this happen?
-It must have been an accident.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.045
Accident?

18:45.290 --> 18:47.656
This was no accident.

18:48.393 --> 18:50.953
These doves were murdered.

18:56.568 --> 18:59.731
Well, that's it.
She's out of the pageant.

19:00.339 --> 19:03.740
-What? Why? What happened?
-Her birds are dead.

19:04.576 --> 19:06.043
-Birds?
-Yeah, birds.

19:06.211 --> 19:08.543
She's got these trained doves.
She does a magic act.

19:08.714 --> 19:11.342
That was her talent for the pageant.

19:11.517 --> 19:15.214
You know what I think, Jerry? I think
somebody murdered those doves.

19:15.787 --> 19:17.880
Somebody wanted her
out of that contest bad.

19:18.056 --> 19:20.456
Somebody who was
just eaten up with jealousy.

19:20.626 --> 19:24.756
Somebody who couldn't stand to have
the spotlight taken off of them.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.494
What are you looking at?

19:32.204 --> 19:33.762
Oh, that. We...

19:33.939 --> 19:36.203
We had to leave that outside
last night...

19:36.375 --> 19:39.936
...because the water
was making the room too cold.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.276
That's...

19:43.849 --> 19:46.113
-You killed them.
-No. You don't understand.

19:46.285 --> 19:48.219
It's not what you think.
It was an accident.

19:48.387 --> 19:51.584
Don't think that you've won, because
you haven't. This kid is a fighter.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.988
And if you think I'm gonna let a couple
of dead birds get in our way...

19:55.160 --> 19:56.957
-...you're crazy!
-Kramer, you gotta--

20:01.200 --> 20:03.691
What was that all about?

20:03.869 --> 20:07.100
Oh, it was just Kramer. Apparently
I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves...

20:07.272 --> 20:09.035
...with the bucket of water
last night.

20:16.648 --> 20:18.912
Ladies and gentlemen,
that was Miss Texas.

20:19.418 --> 20:20.942
Wasn't she wonderful?

20:21.119 --> 20:24.714
And now, continuing with
the talent portion of the competition...

20:24.890 --> 20:27.051
-Okay, this is it.
-How you feeling?

20:27.226 --> 20:30.059
-I'm a little nervous.
-There's nothing to be nervous about.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.891
But I've never sung
before in my life.

20:33.498 --> 20:36.729
And now, let's welcome
Karen Ann Hanson...

20:36.902 --> 20:39.200
...Miss Rhode Island.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.931
I heard those doves
were really incredible.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.161
That's a shame.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.872
It's like watching
an animal get tortured.

21:22.648 --> 21:26.084
-Hey, hey. Yankee game.
-Oh, great. All right.

21:26.251 --> 21:27.809
<i>And the Yankees take the field.</i>

21:27.986 --> 21:31.251
<i>What is with the Yankees? They look
like they're having trouble running.</i>

21:31.423 --> 21:34.449
<i>-They. can't move.
-It's their uniforms. They're too tight.</i>

21:34.626 --> 21:37.595
<i>They've shrunk. They're running
like penguins. Forget this game.</i>

21:37.763 --> 21:41.199
<i>Oh, my. God,
Mattingly. just split his pants.</i>

21:42.301 --> 21:44.496
That's a shame.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.978
Poise. Poise.

22:04.856 --> 22:08.257
The Miss America pageant
seems like a really tough contest.

22:08.427 --> 22:11.760
You come out there in the
bathing suit and the dress shoes.

22:11.930 --> 22:14.228
They got that
sanitized-for-your-protection...

22:14.399 --> 22:17.368
...toilet-seat thing hanging off them,
you know?

22:17.536 --> 22:20.334
Plus, they gotta wear
all the other outfits. I don't know why.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.939
The bathing suit is the contest.

22:23.108 --> 22:25.042
You win the bathing suit, you win.

22:25.210 --> 22:28.407
Everybody looks good in formalwear.
It's dark, it covers everything.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.571
That's why we have weddings in it.

22:30.749 --> 22:32.649
If we had weddings
in bathing suits...

22:32.818 --> 22:34.786
...a lot of ceremonies
wouldn't get past:

22:34.953 --> 22:36.250
"lf anyone sees any reason...

22:36.421 --> 22:39.413
...why these two people
should not be joined together..."

22:39.591 --> 22:42.025
About 80 hands go up.
