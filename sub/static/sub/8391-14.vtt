00:03.240 --> 00:05.515
FOR AN EXTREMELY
YOUTH-ORIENTED PRODUCT,

00:05.550 --> 00:07.199
AND IT IS GOING
TO GET RADICAL.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.105
- I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

00:09.140 --> 00:11.074
WHEN YOU REGAIN OUR TRUST,
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR DOOR BACK.

00:11.110 --> 00:12.077
- YOU GUYS
HAVE GONE CRAZY.

00:12.110 --> 00:13.839

YOU GOT TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT
WITH YOUR FOLKS.

00:15.490 --> 00:17.833
I MISS YOU.

00:17.870 --> 00:19.735
- WHEN YOU TELL A TEENAGE GIRL
THAT SHE CAN'T HAVE SOMETHING,

00:19.770 --> 00:21.146
SHE'S GONNA WANT IT
EVEN MORE.

00:21.190 --> 00:22.464
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THAT.
- RIGHT.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.637
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:23.670 --> 00:25.399

YEAH, I DO.

00:40.210 --> 00:42.303
- YOUR DAD CAUGHT A TROUT
WITH THIS BABY

00:42.350 --> 00:43.681
ON HIS FIRST
CAMPING EXPERIENCE.

00:43.730 --> 00:45.755
YOU READY TO CATCH
SOME FISH, MAX?

00:45.800 --> 00:46.789

JUST WAIT TILL WE GET OUT THERE.

00:48.390 --> 00:49.459

TELL HIM IT'S GONNA
BE FUN, ADAM.

MORE ENTHUSIASTICALLY.

00:53.460 --> 00:55.280

00:55.330 --> 00:56.490
IT'S PART OF THE WHOLE

00:56.530 --> 00:59.533
BRAVERMAN MALE-BON DING
CAMPING EXPERIENCE.

00:59.570 --> 01:01.811

CATCH OUR DINNER

01:01.850 --> 01:03.260
AND COOK IT ON A FIRE

01:03.300 --> 01:04.779
AND SLEEP
UNDER THE STARS.

01:04.820 --> 01:06.674
HUH? YOU READY TO DO
SOME BONDING, MAX?

01:06.720 --> 01:08.369
- UH-HUH.

01:08.410 --> 01:10.640

OF THE FIVE BEST MOMENTS

01:10.690 --> 01:12.578
OF YOUR LIFE, GRANDSON.

01:12.620 --> 01:13.518
- YOU KNOW, GRANDMA'S MAKING

01:13.550 --> 01:15.097
HER WAFFLES
WITH THE CHOCOLATE CHIPS,

01:15.140 --> 01:18.587
SO I'M GONNA GO INSIDE.
- ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.

01:18.630 --> 01:20.825
LISTEN, DAD,
ABOUT THE FISHING--

01:20.870 --> 01:22.724
I JUST WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW,

01:22.770 --> 01:24.726
IT'S A LONG TIME FOR HIM
TO BE SITTING DOWN AND WAITING,

01:24.770 --> 01:26.624
AND MAX LIKES THINGS
TO HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.638
- OH, HE'S GONNA BE FINE, SON.
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

01:28.670 --> 01:30.592
YOU AND KRISTINA--
YOU WORRY TOO MUCH.

01:30.640 --> 01:31.629
- LISTEN, DAD, WE JUST--

01:31.670 --> 01:34.366
WE JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE
A SUCCESSFUL TRIP, OKAY?

01:34.400 --> 01:36.436
SO THAT'S...

01:36.470 --> 01:39.223
WHY KRISTINA
PUT THIS TOGETHER FOR YOU.

01:39.270 --> 01:41.158
IF YOU COULD
JUST GIVE IT A READ.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.929
- NOW, WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

01:42.960 --> 01:45.269
- IT'S JUST A SET
OF, YOU KNOW, GUIDELINES

01:45.310 --> 01:48.234
TO HELP YOU AND MAX
HAVE A SUCCESSFUL TRIP.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.373
- OH, NOW, I DON'T NEED
AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL

01:50.420 --> 01:52.138
TO TAKE MY GRANDSON CAMPING
FOR ONE NIGHT, SON.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.659
- ACTUALLY, YOU DO.

01:53.690 --> 01:55.271
- HUH.
- OKAY?

01:55.320 --> 01:58.289
- WELL, WORRY NOT, MY SON.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.187
- WORRY I WILL,
MY FATHER.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.252
- OH, BOY.
THIS IS WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.

02:07.290 --> 02:07.972
- YEAH.

02:09.470 --> 02:10.676
- OH, MY GOD,
IT'S SCENTED.

02:10.710 --> 02:11.916
- YEAH.
[laughing]

02:11.950 --> 02:13.747
- OH, BOY.

02:13.780 --> 02:15.475
- OH! JULIA.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.159
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.337
- SHE'S SUCH A SWEETHEART

02:18.370 --> 02:19.849
FOR THROWING ME
AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY,

02:19.890 --> 02:21.403
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT,

02:21.450 --> 02:22.678
SHE KIND OF SCARES ME
A LITTLE BIT.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.369
- OH, JULIA SCARES YOU.
- YEAH.

02:24.420 --> 02:25.853
- I'VE NEVER HEARD
THAT BEFORE.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.175
- "PASSED HORS D'OEUVRES,
FORMAL DINNER,

02:28.210 --> 02:28.960
PARTY GAMES"?

02:29.010 --> 02:30.409
EMBOSSED INVITATION?

02:30.460 --> 02:32.280
THERE'S ONLY GONNA BE,
LIKE, FIVE PEOPLE THERE.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.389
I MEAN, ISN'T THIS
A BIT MUCH?

02:33.420 --> 02:35.980
I MEAN, I'M APPRECIATIVE
FOR HER DOING THIS FOR ME,

02:36.010 --> 02:36.908
BUT I'M FINE WITH PIZZA.

02:36.940 --> 02:39.181
I'M SIMPLE.
I DON'T NEED A BIG TO-DO.

02:39.220 --> 02:42.189
- YOU UNDERSTAND THIS PARTY
ISN'T ABOUT YOU, RIGHT?

02:42.230 --> 02:43.561
- YEAH, IT IS.

02:43.610 --> 02:46.704
IT'S THE BRAVER-WOMEN
INVITING ME INTO THEIR TRIBE.

02:46.750 --> 02:47.978
- NO, NO, THIS--

02:48.020 --> 02:50.193
THIS PARTY'S ABOUT JULIA
PROVING SOMETHING.

02:50.230 --> 02:51.265
- PROVING WHAT?

02:51.300 --> 02:52.619
- WELL, THAT'S NOT CLEAR
JUST YET,

02:52.650 --> 02:55.164
BUT BELIEVE ME,
SHE'S OUT TO PROVE SOMETHING.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.720
- ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, RIGHT?

03:00.760 --> 03:02.682
IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS,
AND I WANT HER HOME.

03:02.730 --> 03:05.244
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
- YEAH.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.339
BUT WE CAN'T JUST DRAG
HER HOME.

03:07.390 --> 03:08.550
- WHY NOT?

03:08.600 --> 03:10.488
- 'CAUSE SHE'LL JUST
LEAVE AGAIN.

03:10.530 --> 03:14.466
- I'M SURE YOUR MOM'S HAVING
ONE BIG PARTY OVER THERE.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.842
- KRISTINA, COME ON,
YOU KNOW,

03:15.880 --> 03:17.700
MY MOM'S NOT
ON HADDIE'S SIDE HERE.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.298
- OH, YES, SHE IS.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.890
SHE REALLY IS.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.296
- LOOK, KRISTINA,
I JUST--

03:23.340 --> 03:24.568
I DON'T WANT
TO SHOW UP THERE

03:24.610 --> 03:26.407
AND MAKE THINGS WORSE
BY FORCING THE ISSUE.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.328
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

03:28.380 --> 03:29.859
- OKAY, WELL, SHE'S 16.

03:29.890 --> 03:32.279
SHE'S OUR DAUGHTER,
AND I WANT HER HOME.

03:32.310 --> 03:34.301
- I'M NOT A GHOST
IN THIS TOWN

03:34.350 --> 03:37.626
- ALL RIGHT.
[doorbell rings]

03:41.040 --> 03:42.769
- WHAT'S WITH THE DOORBELL?

03:42.800 --> 03:43.789
COME ON IN.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.877
- UH, THANKS,
BUT WE'RE, UH...

03:46.910 --> 03:49.014
WE'RE HERE
TO TALK TO HADDIE,

03:49.050 --> 03:50.665
PRIVATELY,
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND.

03:50.710 --> 03:51.870
- SURE, I'LL GET HER.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.775
- THANKS, MOM.
- THANK YOU.

03:54.820 --> 03:57.391
AWIQNARD.

04:04.930 --> 04:06.306
- HEY.

04:06.340 --> 04:08.274
- CAN WE TALK TO YOU?

04:08.310 --> 04:10.346
- PRIVATELY, OUTSIDE?

04:10.380 --> 04:12.348
- OKAY.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.283
- WE WANT YOU
TO COME HOME.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.469
- WELL, YOU KNOW
MY CONDITION.

04:24.500 --> 04:25.979
- HADDIE, COME ON,
WE'RE YOUR PARENTS, OKAY?

04:26.020 --> 04:27.806
WE'RE NOT HERE TO NEGOTIATE.
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

04:27.850 --> 04:30.956
- WELL, I'M NOT GONNA COME HOME
UNTIL I CAN SEE ALEX.

04:30.990 --> 04:32.673
- HADDIE, I KNOW
THAT YOU THINK YOU'RE AN ADULT

04:32.720 --> 04:34.506
AND YOU CAN MAKE UP
YOUR OWN MIND ABOUT THINGS.

04:34.550 --> 04:35.744
BUT YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE 16.

04:35.790 --> 04:37.678
AND YOU LIVE IN OUR HOUSE.
- ABSOLUTELY.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.995
- WELL, NOT RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT THERE.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.089
- YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A BABY.

04:42.140 --> 04:44.108
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DATE ALEX
ACTING LIKE THIS.

04:44.140 --> 04:45.516
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

04:45.560 --> 04:46.629
- DAD?

04:46.660 --> 04:47.729
- YEAH?

04:47.770 --> 04:49.340
- IS THIS THE WAY
THAT YOU FEEL

04:49.390 --> 04:51.005
AFI'ER ALEX
WENT TO TALK TO YOU?

04:54.880 --> 04:56.973
- I LIKE ALEX, OKAY?

04:57.020 --> 04:58.089
I DON'T THINK

04:58.120 --> 04:59.633
IT'S AN APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP
FOR YOU,

04:59.670 --> 05:01.399
AND I THINK THAT STAYING HERE
IS A STUNT.

05:01.430 --> 05:02.670
- WHY DON'T WE HAVE
A CONVERSATION

05:02.710 --> 05:05.122
ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES
YOU UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT ALEX?

05:05.160 --> 05:06.195
- WE HAD A CONVERSATION

05:06.230 --> 05:08.118
ABOUT WHAT MAKES US
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT ALEX.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.092
- BUT WE CAN GET PAST IT

05:09.130 --> 05:10.882
IF YOU JUST TALK ABOUT IT
AND DON'T JUST--

05:10.930 --> 05:12.500
- YOU'RE 16 YEARS OLD.
YOU'RE A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL.

05:12.550 --> 05:13.778
HE'S 19.
HE LIVES IN AN APARTMENT.

05:13.830 --> 05:14.717
- WHAT ABOUT HIM
BEING BLACK?

05:14.760 --> 05:16.512
- THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT, OKAY?

05:16.550 --> 05:17.994
PLEASE DON'T EVER BRING
THAT UP AGAIN.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.519
- WE'RE NOT RACIST, OKAY?

05:19.560 --> 05:21.061
- WELL, THEN...
- YOU'RE 16.

05:21.110 --> 05:22.418
HE'S 19, OKAY?

05:22.460 --> 05:24.599
- I MEAN,
I'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE.

05:24.630 --> 05:27.383
- HE'S AN ALCOHOLIC,
AND YOU'RE NOT AN ALCOHOLIC.

05:27.430 --> 05:29.148
- STOP SAYING THINGS
THAT ARE JUST WRONG WITH HIM.

05:29.190 --> 05:30.691
THIS IS SOMEBODY
THAT I CARE ABOUT

05:30.740 --> 05:32.082
THAT I WANT TO BE WITH.

05:33.780 --> 05:35.395
- [sighs]

05:35.430 --> 05:37.113
- YOU WANT TO BE WITH HIM?

05:37.160 --> 05:38.536
- YES.

05:38.570 --> 05:41.403
- MORE THAN YOU
WANT TO BE WITH US?

05:42.610 --> 05:43.599
- YES.

05:43.650 --> 05:45.993
- THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
TO SAY.

05:46.030 --> 05:47.850
- I AGREE.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.130
EXCUSE ME.

05:51.170 --> 05:53.411

06:55.960 --> 06:57.757
WHICH WE DON'T NORMALLY DO

06:57.790 --> 06:59.542

06:59.590 --> 07:01.649
I'M TRYING

07:54.920 --> 07:55.841
- UH-HUH.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.269
- OH, GOSH, THIS IS
SO IMPORTANT TO ME.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.746
- CLEARLY.
WE STILL GOT TWO DAYS, HON.

08:00.790 --> 08:02.234
- [sighs] I JUST--
I WANT IT TO BE AWESOME.

08:02.270 --> 08:03.339
- IT WILL BE, HONEY.

08:03.370 --> 08:06.646
- I KNOW. I JUST--
I WANT THEM TO LEAVE AND SAY,

08:06.690 --> 08:07.850
"I CAN'T BELIEVE
I EVER THOUGHT

08:07.900 --> 08:09.583
THAT IT WAS NOT GONNA BE FUN
AT JULIA'S."

08:09.620 --> 08:10.928
- I'M SURE
THEY DON'T THINK THAT.

08:10.970 --> 08:12.961
- I KNOW.
I'M SURE THEY DON'T.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.173
AND YET, THEY GO
TO MOM AND DAD'S,

08:15.210 --> 08:16.859
AND THEY GO
TO ADAM AND KRISTINA'S,

08:16.910 --> 08:18.525
AND THEY DON'T COME HERE.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.619
- WELL, IT'S PROBABLY 'CAUSE
WE'RE KIND OF OUT OF THE WAY.

08:20.670 --> 08:21.807
- NO, LET'S BE HONEST.

08:21.840 --> 08:22.943
THEY NEED TO KNOW
THAT IT'S FUN HERE.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.732
- IT IS FUN HERE.
- IT'S FUN HERE.

08:24.780 --> 08:25.735
- IT'S TONS OF FUN HERE.
- IT IS.

08:25.780 --> 08:26.735
- YOU, ME, A SIX-YEAR-OLD.

08:26.780 --> 08:29.089
- I HAVE HORS D'OEUVRES
FOR THE LIVING ROOM

08:29.120 --> 08:30.815
AND THEN A SIT-DOWN DINNER.
- YOU DO.

08:30.850 --> 08:32.192
- AND THEN
I HAVE PARTY GAMES.

08:32.230 --> 08:33.572
- OH RE--
PARTY GAMES?

08:33.610 --> 08:35.783
- MM-HMM.
- YOU DON'T THINK THAT SOUNDS

08:35.820 --> 08:37.048
A LITTLE, UH...?
- WHAT?

08:37.100 --> 08:38.852
- UH, JUST PLANNED.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.091
- IT WON'T FEEL PLANNED.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.960
IT'S GONNA--
IT'S GONNA FLOW NICELY

08:45.000 --> 08:46.797
AND FEEL VERY NATURAL AND FUN.
- YEAH.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.037
- AND A GOOD PARTY
NEEDS STRUCTURE.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.104
- MM.
- YEAH.

08:50.150 --> 08:52.004
- OKAY.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.280
YEAH.

08:56.910 --> 08:59.708
- KRISTINA.
[chuckles]

08:59.740 --> 09:01.355
HI.
- OH, HEY.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.015
UM, CAN I COME IN?

09:03.050 --> 09:04.563
- OF COURSE.
- THANK YOU.

09:04.610 --> 09:05.565
IJUST, UM...

09:05.610 --> 09:07.953
I WANTED TO DROP OFF
SOME CLOTHES FOR HADDIE.

09:07.990 --> 09:09.127
- OH.
- YEAH.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.980
I'M SURE SHE'S BORROWING
ALL OF AMBER'S.

09:11.030 --> 09:12.884
- GOOD IDEA.
SHE'LL BE HAPPY TO SEE THOSE.

09:12.930 --> 09:15.194
- YEAH. I ALSO WANT TO GIVE YOU,
UM, SOME MONEY.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.889
- OH, NO, NO.
- I'M SURE SHE'S BEEN EATING YOU

09:16.930 --> 09:18.204
OUT OF HOUISIEAND HOME.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.937
- SO JUST A COUPLE BUCKS.
- NO, I'M NOT TAKING IT.

09:21.970 --> 09:23.244
BUT COULD WE TALK

09:23.280 --> 09:25.145
JUST FOR A MINUTE?

09:25.180 --> 09:29.731
- YEAH, SURE.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.909
- WE'RE BOTH ON THE SAME SIDE
HERE, YOU KNOW.

09:31.950 --> 09:33.599
RIGHT?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.733
WE BOTH JUST WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR HADDIE.

09:35.780 --> 09:37.088
- I KNOW. I-I DO.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.008
WE BOTH DO.
I'M JUST--I'M UPSET AT HER,

09:39.060 --> 09:41.221
AND I'M TAKING IT OUT ON YOU,
AND I DON'T MEAN TO.

09:41.270 --> 09:43.056
I DON'T.
- IT'S OKAY, REALLY.

09:43.090 --> 09:44.739
- OKAY.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

09:44.790 --> 09:45.950
- THANKS.

09:45.990 --> 09:48.993
- I JUST THINK THAT

09:49.030 --> 09:51.919
YOU MIGHT BE CHOOSING
THE WRONG BA'I'I'LE HERE.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.417
- OKAY, CAMILLE, I DON'T WANT
TO GET INTO THIS AGAIN.

09:56.450 --> 09:58.896
- WELL, I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S
GONNA DO ANY GOOD TO TELL HADDIE

09:58.940 --> 10:00.965
THAT SHE CAN'T SEE ALEX,
YOU KNOW.

10:01.010 --> 10:01.795
- OH, OKAY.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.421
- SHE'S FALLING
IN LOVE WITH HIM.

10:03.460 --> 10:05.189
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

10:05.220 --> 10:07.632
I MEAN,
YOU CAN LIKE IT OR NOT,

10:07.670 --> 10:09.661
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL HER
TO NOT FEEL WHAT SHE'S FEELING.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.916
- MM-HMM.

10:10.950 --> 10:13.635
CAMILLE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH, OKAY?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.011
BUT I'VE GOT IT COVERED.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.263
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

10:19.300 --> 10:23.020
SO PLEASE MAKE SURE
SHE GETS THOSE CLOTHES AND...

10:32.700 --> 10:36.101
- YOUR MOTHER CAN BE
SO CONDESCENDING.

10:36.150 --> 10:37.936
- I KNOW HOW MY MOTHER
CAN BE, KRISTINA.

10:37.980 --> 10:39.117
THANK YOU.

10:39.150 --> 10:40.947
- I MEAN, WHOSE SIDE
IS SHE ON, YOU KNOW?

10:40.980 --> 10:42.424
IT'S LIKE,
HELP US OUT HERE, CAMILLE.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.087
- I DON'T THINK THERE ARE
ANY SIDES HERE, KRISTINA.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.257
I THINK THAT MY MOTHER

10:45.290 --> 10:47.258
IS JUST TRYING TO BE SUPPORTIVE
OF HER GRANDDAUGHTER.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.870
- MM-HMM.
- AND SHE KNOWS ALEX WELL

10:48.920 --> 10:51.013
FROM WORKING
AT THE SOUP KITCHEN,

10:51.060 --> 10:52.982
SO MAYBE SHE HAS
A VALID POINT OF VIEW.

10:53.030 --> 10:55.021
- I KNOW THAT SHE KNOWS
ALEX, OKAY?

10:55.060 --> 10:57.028
BUT I KNOW THAT HE'S
AN ALCOHOLIC, OKAY?

10:57.070 --> 10:58.332
AND HE'S 19,
AND HE LIVES BY HIMSELF.

10:58.380 --> 10:59.859
- YEAH, I KNOW
HE'S AN ALCOHOLIC TOO,

10:59.900 --> 11:00.992
AND I KNOW HE HAS
HIS OWN APARTMENT.

11:01.030 --> 11:02.236
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
ALL THIS, OKAY?

11:02.280 --> 11:03.963
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH OUR LIST
OF PROS AND CONS

11:04.000 --> 11:05.479
ON THE LIST
THAT WE MADE, YOU KNOW.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.080
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

11:08.110 --> 11:11.034
- MAYBE WE MADE A MISTAKE.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.117
- OKAY, GO ON.

11:14.150 --> 11:16.732
GO AHEAD.

11:16.770 --> 11:18.089
- I LIKE HIM.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.462
- YOU LIKE HIM?

11:19.500 --> 11:21.320
- YEAH.
- THAT'S GREAT.

11:21.370 --> 11:23.053
YOU SPEND TEN MINUTES
WITH HIM AT YOUR OFFICE.

11:23.090 --> 11:25.126
HE COMES BY,
AND NOW YOU LIKE HIM.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.229
THIS DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE TO ME.

11:26.270 --> 11:27.988
- KRISTINA, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
AN ARGUMENT, OKAY?

11:28.030 --> 11:29.099
- I'M NOT HAVING
AN ARGUMENT, OKAY?

11:29.130 --> 11:31.849
- I'M JUST SAYING,
HE HAS INTEGRITY. HE'S POLITE.

11:31.890 --> 11:33.300
HE'S SMART. HE'S HONEST.
I LIKE HIM.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.513
- THAT'S AMAZING.
MAYBE YOU GUYS CAN BE PALS.

11:35.550 --> 11:37.757
MAYBE YOU CAN BE FRIENDS
AND HANG OUT--

11:37.800 --> 11:39.244
- KRISTINA.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.963
I FEEL LIKE WE MADE
THIS DECISION,

11:41.010 --> 11:42.932
AND NOW WE'VE JUST GOT
OUR HEELS DUG IN.

11:42.970 --> 11:43.834
WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE FACE,

11:43.870 --> 11:45.758
AND I THINK WE'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE, OKAY?

11:45.800 --> 11:47.939
- YOU'RE WRONG. I KNOW
WHERE THIS IS HEADED, HONEY.

11:47.980 --> 11:50.005
THEY'RE AT TWO DIFFERENT STAGES
IN THEIR LIVES RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

11:50.050 --> 11:52.257
SHE'S GONNA START SPENDING
THE NIGHT, OKAY?

11:52.290 --> 11:53.803
SHE'S GONNA START
SLEEPING OVER THERE.

11:53.850 --> 11:55.329
SHE'S GONNA START HAVING SEX
WITH HIM,

11:55.360 --> 11:57.089
AND WE'RE GONNA LOSE HER
TO THIS GUY

11:57.130 --> 11:58.324
THAT WE DON'T EVEN
REALLY KNOW.

11:58.370 --> 11:59.507
- GONNA START HAVING SEX?

11:59.540 --> 12:01.121
KRISTINA, YOU GOT
TO WAKE UP HERE, OKAY?

12:01.160 --> 12:02.536
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF
IS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

12:02.580 --> 12:03.433
WE'RE GONNA LOSE HER.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.744
WE JUST LOST HER
FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS

12:05.790 --> 12:07.018
OVER AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE.
- ADAM...

12:07.070 --> 12:08.788
- THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

12:08.830 --> 12:10.229
WHEN SHE TURNS 18.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.759
WE CAN LOSE HER.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.721
[door slams]

12:21.430 --> 12:22.829
[knock at door]
- HEY.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.313
- HI. WANT ONE OF THESE?
- YEAH.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.566
- I HAVE ONE
THAT SAYS "ADAM."

12:25.600 --> 12:27.522
DO YOU WANT THAT ONE?
- YEAH, I DO.

12:27.570 --> 12:29.458
IT'S GOT MY NAME ON IT.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.252
- SHE GOT OFF TO SCHOOL
OKAY THIS MORNING,

12:31.300 --> 12:32.392
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.193
- I WASN'T WORRIED.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:35.230 --> 12:36.333
- HOW'D SHE SEEM?

12:38.510 --> 12:39.920
- LIKE A TEENAGER.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.370
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

12:41.410 --> 12:42.923
- THAT'S DISTURBING.
- I KNOW.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.200
ADAM, DON'T WORRY,
YOU KNOW.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.162
THINK OF HOW MANY TIMES
I DISAPPEARED, I MEAN--

12:46.210 --> 12:47.518
WELL, DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT.
- YEAH.

12:47.550 --> 12:50.348
I DON'T WANT TO THINK
ABOUT THAT.

12:50.390 --> 12:51.482
- IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO?

12:51.520 --> 12:53.101
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:53.150 --> 12:54.868
JUST DON'T MAKE IT
TOO COMFORTABLE FOR HER.

12:54.910 --> 12:55.763
- OH, GOD, NO.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.041
GOT HER SLEEPING
IN A ROOM WITH AMBER.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.524
NO ONE CAN SURVIVE THAT.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.458
- [laughs]
YEAH.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.912
[sighs]

13:03.950 --> 13:05.110
- IT'S WHAT WE GET

13:05.160 --> 13:07.048
FOR RAISING STRONG,
INDEPENDENT GIRLS.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.398
- SO IT'S OUR FAULT?

13:08.440 --> 13:09.259
- OH, YEAH.

13:09.300 --> 13:10.528
SHOULD HAVE CRUSHED
THEIR SPIRITS

13:10.580 --> 13:11.535
WHILE WE HAD THE CHANCE.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.127
- AH, BLEW IT.

13:13.170 --> 13:15.331
WE'RE BAD PARENTS.

13:17.550 --> 13:19.131
[sighs deeply]

13:19.170 --> 13:20.159
- HERE.
- HUH?

13:20.210 --> 13:21.609
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

13:21.660 --> 13:22.513
- I HAVE A DRAWER
ALL CLEARED OUT FOR YOU.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.551
IT'S COOL.
LOOK, I GOT ALL THIS ROOM.

13:24.590 --> 13:26.512
BESIDES, NOW I CAN STEAL
YOUR SWEATERS, LIKE THIS ONE.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.836
- I LOVE THAT SWEATER.
- ME TOO.

13:29.870 --> 13:31.553
SO...

13:31.600 --> 13:33.318
OBVIOUSLY,
HAVING YOU HERE

13:33.360 --> 13:35.248
IS THE HAPPIEST THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME

13:35.290 --> 13:38.225
IN MY WHOLE LIFE,
BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS.

13:38.260 --> 13:40.114
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
IT'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE

13:40.160 --> 13:41.639
TILL YOU GO BACK?

13:41.680 --> 13:45.468
- I MEAN, UNTIL MY PARENTS
CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT ALEX.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.879
- OKAY.

13:48.930 --> 13:50.579
AND ARE YOU GONNA BE, LIKE,
SEEING ALEX

13:50.620 --> 13:51.951
DURING THIS TIME OR...?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.308
- WELL, HE WON'T SEE ME

13:53.340 --> 13:55.513
UNTIL THEY DO CHANGE
THEIR MINDS, SO...

13:55.550 --> 13:59.418
- SO YOU'RE NOT TALKING
TO YOUR PARENTS

13:59.450 --> 14:01.202
FOR A GUY
THAT WON'T TALK TO YOU.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.626
- I KNOW.

14:02.660 --> 14:05.220
OKAY, IT'S NOT GREAT.
- WELL...

14:05.250 --> 14:06.490
[gasps] OH, NO.

14:06.530 --> 14:08.350
- EW.
- EW.

14:08.390 --> 14:12.258
- IT'S SO MANIPULATIVE.
- IT'S SO MANIPULATIVE.

14:12.290 --> 14:14.360
- BUT IT'S
ALSO KIND OF SWEET.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.504
THEY'RE PRETTY COOL.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.087
- I DON'T KNOW, DAD.

14:18.130 --> 14:19.916
I DON'T THINK IT'S--
OOH! AH!

14:19.960 --> 14:20.949
HA HA HA.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.673
THIS IT?
- NO.

14:22.720 --> 14:26.542
THAT'S THE LAST TIME I LEND
MY COLEMAN STOVE TO ANYBODY.

14:26.580 --> 14:27.683
- HEY.
- HEY.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.608
OH...

14:29.660 --> 14:31.685
THE FUTURE MRS. BRAVERMAN.

14:31.730 --> 14:33.174
- [laughing]

14:33.210 --> 14:35.622
SO I HEAR YOU'RE TAKING
MAX CAMPING.

14:35.660 --> 14:36.695
- YES, I AM.

14:36.730 --> 14:38.527
AND JABBAR'S
GONNA BE NEXT.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.448
- WHAT ABOUT SYDNEY?

14:40.500 --> 14:43.901
- NO, SYDNEY IS A GIRL.

14:46.430 --> 14:48.421
- WHAT?
GIRLS DON'T CAMP?

14:48.470 --> 14:50.677
- NO, HONEY, SEE
THIS IS A MALE-BONDING THING.

14:50.710 --> 14:51.916
IT'S TRADITIONAL.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.268
THIS, LIKE, GOES BACK

14:53.300 --> 14:56.167
TO THE ORIGINAL BRAVERMAN
HUNTER-GATHERERS.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.476
- THAT IS SEXIST
AND ABSURD.

14:59.510 --> 15:01.512
- YES, IT IS...
[clears throat] INDEED.

15:01.550 --> 15:03.279
- WELL...
- [laughs]

15:03.310 --> 15:05.961
- LUCKILY,
WE HAD A BOY, SO...

15:06.000 --> 15:08.514
- OKAY, ON THAT NOTE,
I'M GONNA LEAVE NOW

15:08.560 --> 15:10.528
AND GO TEACH MY CLASS.
- OKAY.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.972
- AND I'M GONNA LEAVE
YOU CAVEMEN TO IT.

15:13.010 --> 15:14.557
- [grunting like an ape]

15:14.600 --> 15:16.181
- BYE.
- BYE.

15:16.220 --> 15:18.939
- WELL, I LOVE A WOMAN
THAT SPEAKS HER MIND.

15:18.980 --> 15:20.971
- MM-HMM.
- SONNY, SHE IS A KEEPER.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.328
- WELL, THANK YOU.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.635
SO, DAD...

15:24.680 --> 15:27.706
YOU'RE 100%
ON THIS MAX CAMPING TRIP?

15:27.750 --> 15:29.672
- OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.267
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LECTURE ME

15:31.300 --> 15:33.370

15:35.340 --> 15:38.616
- HOW MUCH WORSE
COULD IT BE THAN YOURS?

15:38.660 --> 15:40.104
- I DIDN'T HAVE TANTRUMS.

15:42.380 --> 15:44.382
- WELL, YOU WERE
A TERROR, CROSBY.

15:44.420 --> 15:46.559
- NO, YOU HAVE ME CONFUSED
WITH ONE OF YOUR OTHER KIDS.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.591

15:48.630 --> 15:50.518

15:50.570 --> 15:52.117
WHAT I'M TRYING

15:52.150 --> 15:54.710
THIS IS A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT BALL GAME.

16:00.230 --> 16:01.674

IT'S AN EVALUATION OF ME.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.719

WHAT I'M HERE TO DO

16:23.220 --> 16:25.427
IS TO ASK YOU
FOR A RAISE.

16:28.710 --> 16:30.735
LET ME JUST TELL YOU, UM...

16:30.780 --> 16:31.849
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN

APPLYING TO COLLEGE,

16:34.850 --> 16:36.772
AND IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE.

16:36.820 --> 16:39.789
- I TOTALLY GET
THAT YOU NEED TO PAY

16:39.820 --> 16:41.435
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER'S EDUCATION.

16:41.480 --> 16:44.404
- [chuckling] THANK YOU.
OH, MY GOD, BECAUSE--

16:44.450 --> 16:45.542

16:45.590 --> 16:48.161
- YOU--NO, SO JUST
YOU DON'T THINK--

16:48.210 --> 16:50.440
- IT'S JUST
NOT THE RIGHT TIME.

16:50.490 --> 16:53.277
- WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME?

16:55.630 --> 16:57.211

OR MAKE ANY MONEY, YOU KNOW,
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

17:12.470 --> 17:14.267
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.052
- OH, WELL,
I DESIGNED THIS SHOE, SEE,

17:16.100 --> 17:17.852
THAT CLICKED--
IT DIDN'T WORK.

17:17.890 --> 17:19.858
BUT, UM, I THOUGHT,
YOU KNOW, I WOULD TRY

17:19.900 --> 17:22.619
THIS KIND OF DESIGN OUT
AND, YOU KNOW,

17:22.660 --> 17:24.378
SEE IF IT--IF I--

18:27.450 --> 18:29.441
HOW ARE YOU PLANNING

FISH FOR DINNER

18:30.760 --> 18:32.375

THEN SET UP THE TENT?

21:42.160 --> 21:43.149
- WHY CAN'T WE EAT ANYTHING?

21:43.190 --> 21:45.363
- BECAUSE I'M SURE
SHE'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE,

21:45.400 --> 21:46.298
AND THEN SHE GETS TO SEE...
- WE CAN'T EAT THAT?

21:46.330 --> 21:47.365
- HOW BEAUTIFULLY
IT'S ALL PRESENTED.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.960

SHE'S GOT SOMETHING, I THINK.

22:08.180 --> 22:09.693
- IT'S JUST SO EASY.

22:09.740 --> 22:11.116
IT'S LIKE SHOOTING
FISH IN A BARREL.

22:11.150 --> 22:12.629
- YOU'RE A BAD, BAD PERSON.

22:12.670 --> 22:14.399

I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT.

22:14.430 --> 22:16.534

I DON'T DESERVE THAT.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.569

I'D KIND OF LIKE TO TAKE
THE NIGHT OFF

22:58.790 --> 23:00.883
FROM THINKING ABOUT MY TEENAGE
DAUGHTER AND HER PROBLEMS.

23:00.930 --> 23:02.477

THIS IS LADIES' NIGHT.

23:06.620 --> 23:08.440
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
GIRLS' NIGHT.

23:08.490 --> 23:10.037
LET'S MAKE--
- HELLO, HELLO!

23:10.070 --> 23:11.207
- HI!

23:11.250 --> 23:14.458
- THERE SHE IS,
THE BRIDE-TO-BE!

23:14.490 --> 23:16.629
OF COURSE,
THE LADY OF THE HOUR.

23:16.670 --> 23:18.422
- HELLO!

23:18.460 --> 23:20.599
- HELLO.
EVERYONE LOOKS GORGEOUS.

23:20.640 --> 23:24.497
- OKAY, SO THE BRIDE-TO-BE
HAS TO WEAR THIS!

23:24.540 --> 23:25.700
- OH, WOW.

23:25.740 --> 23:27.879
- IT'S YOUR PARTY!
- I'LL JUST PUT IT--

23:27.920 --> 23:29.228
UH, I NEED A MIRROR
TO PUT IT ON.

23:29.260 --> 23:30.704
- AFTER YOU HAVE A DRINK.

23:30.750 --> 23:32.433
- AND A DRINK.
- A DRINK.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.539
- YES. YES, YES, YES.
- I MADE MOJITOS.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.548
- AND THEY'RE GOOD.
- THEY ARE GOOD, RIGHT?

23:36.580 --> 23:38.229
- YEAH.

23:38.270 --> 23:40.204
- WE ALSO HAVE RED WINE,
WHITE WINE.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.585
- OH, I'M COMING.
- OKAY, DO YOU WANT A MOJITO?

23:46.490 --> 23:47.559
- HEY.

23:47.590 --> 23:49.524
- HEY.
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME?

23:49.560 --> 23:51.039
- I FIGURED IT OUT.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.799
- YOU FIGURED WHAT OUT--
COLD FUSION?

23:53.840 --> 23:54.943
[pen clatters]

23:54.980 --> 23:55.901
- NO.

23:55.950 --> 23:58.089
I FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO
WITH THE COMPANY.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.566
- OH, OKAY.
WHAT, UH...

24:00.610 --> 24:01.747
WHAT'S, UH--WHAT'S ALL THIS?

24:01.780 --> 24:03.771
- ALL RIGHT, CHECK IT OUT.
THIS IS WHERE WE STARTED.

24:03.820 --> 24:06.152
ONE STORE
ON UNIVERSITY AVENUE

24:06.200 --> 24:09.055
WITH ONE SHOE--
ONE BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT DESIGN.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.579
- YEAH, I KNOW,
I WAS THERE.

24:10.620 --> 24:11.848
- I KNOW YOU WERE, MAN.

24:11.890 --> 24:13.266
I KNOW YOU WERE.

24:13.310 --> 24:14.709
AND THEN WE EXPANDED.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.649
TWO STORES, THREE STORES
- YEP.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.658
- THEN WE STARTED SELLING
TO CHAIN STORES.

24:19.690 --> 24:21.487
THEN THERE'S
THE ONLINE STORE, RIGHT?

24:21.520 --> 24:23.522
THE T&S CROSS-TRAINER.
- YEAH.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.868
- THE T&S AIR WALKER.

24:24.910 --> 24:26.480
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE WERE DIVERSIFYING

24:26.530 --> 24:27.599
THE PRODUCT LINE
AT THE TIME.

24:27.630 --> 24:29.279
- AND WE WIPED OUT, DUDE.
- IT WAS A BIG SELLER.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.878
- WHO CARES?

24:30.910 --> 24:32.775
WE LOST THE MAGIC.

24:32.810 --> 24:35.529
GIMMICKS, MAN...

24:35.570 --> 24:39.529
GIMMICKS, THEY'RE JUST--
OH, I CAN'T STAND THEM.

24:39.580 --> 24:41.536
WHEN I BOUGHT MY FIRST PAIR
OF T&S SHOES,

24:41.580 --> 24:45.641
I WAS LIKE,
"YES, THIS IS ME.

24:45.690 --> 24:47.305
THIS IS WHO I AM."

24:47.340 --> 24:49.092
AND LOOK AT US NOW.

24:49.140 --> 24:51.608
LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE BECOME--

24:51.660 --> 24:53.275
JUST GIMMICKS...

24:53.310 --> 24:54.550
- UH-HU_H.
[wrapper crinkles]

24:54.590 --> 24:56.137
- AND CLUTTER.
- OKAY.

24:56.180 --> 24:58.523
- WE TOTALLY LOST
OUR WAY, MAN.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.596
MMM.

25:00.630 --> 25:01.972
[wrapper crinkles]

25:02.010 --> 25:03.978
- EDIBLE?

25:04.010 --> 25:06.217
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

25:06.260 --> 25:08.182
- IN 1999,
I BOUGHT MY FIRST PAIR

25:08.230 --> 25:09.800
OF T&S SURF-RIDERS,

25:09.850 --> 25:11.602
THE BEST DAMN SANDAL
EVER MADE, MAN.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.846
- AGREED.
THAT WAS A GREAT SHOE.

25:12.890 --> 25:16.269
- IT WAS A GREAT SHOE.

25:16.300 --> 25:19.303
ONE SHOE...
ONE SHOE, DUDE--

25:19.340 --> 25:21.649
THAT IS OUR MISSION.
- MM-HMM.

25:21.690 --> 25:24.898
WELL, YOU KNOW, CORY,

25:24.930 --> 25:26.818
THAT'S JUST NOT THE WAY
THIS BUSINESS

25:26.870 --> 25:27.962
REALLY WORKS ANYMORE.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.001
- EXACTLY.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.894
IT'S WHAT MADE T&S GREAT.

25:30.940 --> 25:33.591
IT'LL BE WHAT MAKES
IT GREAT AGAIN.

25:38.390 --> 25:40.779
- SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.
- I KNOW.

25:40.810 --> 25:42.152
- BY THE TIME JABBAR
GOES TO COLLEGE,

25:42.190 --> 25:43.703
WHO KNOWS HOW EXPENSIVE
IT'LL BE?

25:43.740 --> 25:45.560
- OH, THAT'S WHAT
I'M DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW.

25:45.610 --> 25:46.531
I QUIT MY JOB WITH ADAM

25:46.570 --> 25:48.322
BECAUSE I MAKE MORE IN TIPS
AT THE BAR.

25:48.370 --> 25:50.747
IT'S NOT MY DREAM,
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

25:50.790 --> 25:52.951
- WELL, NOW YOU HAVE TIME
TO PURSUE YOUR DREAM.

25:52.990 --> 25:54.093
- OH, OKAY, MOM.

25:54.130 --> 25:55.267
- OKAY.
- I'LL DO THAT BETWEEN SHIFTS.

25:55.310 --> 25:56.891
- I WAS THINKING
BEFORE DESSERT

25:56.930 --> 25:58.613
AND BEFORE WE OPEN
YOUR PRESENTS,

25:58.660 --> 25:59.581
WE WOULD PLAY THIS GAME.

25:59.620 --> 26:00.996
"TABLE TOPICS--

26:01.040 --> 26:03.065
QUESTIONS TO START
GREAT CONVERSATIONS."

26:03.110 --> 26:04.793
SO LET'S GO
TO THE TABLE.

26:04.830 --> 26:07.173
- WAIT, WE'RE AT THE TABLE,
AND WE HAVE TOPICS.

26:07.220 --> 26:08.699
- YES, BUT WE'RE DONE
WITH DINNER,

26:08.730 --> 26:09.936
AND WE'RE GONNA GO
TO THAT TABLE.

26:09.980 --> 26:11.208
- WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.389
- AND THIS IS GONNA BE ANOTHER
DIFFERENT, FUN CONVERSATION.

26:13.430 --> 26:14.977
- OH! A DIFFERENT,
FUN ONE, OKAY.

26:15.020 --> 26:17.181
- COME ON, LET'S GO.
IT WILL BE FUN.

26:17.230 --> 26:19.698
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
- "TABLE TOPICS."

26:19.750 --> 26:20.910
CAN'T WAIT.

26:20.950 --> 26:23.089
- UH, HEY, JULES,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:23.130 --> 26:25.155
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA HEAD OUT.
I'VE--I'M--

26:25.200 --> 26:27.122
- OH, KRISTINA.
- I'M SO TIRED.

26:27.170 --> 26:29.309
I'VE HAD JUST
A REALLY LONG WEEK, AND I'M--

26:29.340 --> 26:30.409
- I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE MISSING DESSERT.

26:30.450 --> 26:31.826
- I KNOW. SAVE ME SOME.

26:31.860 --> 26:33.339
- LET HER GO.

26:33.380 --> 26:36.611
[whispering]
SHE HAS A LOT ON HER MIND.

26:36.660 --> 26:38.104
- I'M SORRY.
WHAT, CAMILLE? I--

26:38.140 --> 26:40.654
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

26:40.700 --> 26:42.622
'CAUSE I'M...

26:42.670 --> 26:44.171
- [normal voice] I JUST SAID
YOU HAVE A LOT ON YOUR MIND,

26:44.220 --> 26:47.280
AND IF YOU WANT TO GO,
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.322
- THANK YOU.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.669
DINNER WAS DELICIOUS.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.769
I'LL SEE YA.

26:56.780 --> 26:59.715
[door opens, closes]

26:59.750 --> 27:02.127
- NO, YOU GOT TO GO
IN THAT HALF-PIPE.

27:02.170 --> 27:03.649
YOU GOT TO GO
IN FROM THE TOP.

27:03.690 --> 27:04.952
[doorbell rings]
- YEAH, I SAW THE BARREL.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.069
- IF YOU GO OVER--
HIT PAUSE.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.715
[knock at door]
IF YOU OLLIE IT,

27:07.760 --> 27:09.728
YOU GET EXTRA POINTS.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.068
- HEY, SORRY I'M LATE.

27:11.110 --> 27:12.441
I JUST GOT CALLED
INTO THE OFFICE.

27:12.490 --> 27:14.765
IT WAS A TOTAL AMBUSH.
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.006
BUT IT WAS
PRETTY MIND-BLOWING TOO,

27:16.040 --> 27:17.667
BECAUSE YOU REMEMBER
THAT BOSS THAT I HAVE

27:17.700 --> 27:19.042
WHO I THINK IS AN IDIOT,
BUT HE--

27:19.080 --> 27:20.047
YOU DON'T REMEMBER THAT GUY?

27:20.080 --> 27:21.047
WELL, HE'S NOT AN IDIOT.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.729
I MEAN, HE IS,
BUT HE'S NOT.

27:22.770 --> 27:24.738
HE'S GOT ALL
TH ESE WACKED-OUT CHARTS

27:24.780 --> 27:27.328
AND MUMBO JUMBO DRAWN
ALL OVER HIS OFFICE WALLS.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.749
IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE
WHATSOEVER

27:29.780 --> 27:31.748
UNTIL, BAM, IT HITS ME
LIKE A RAINBOW.

27:31.780 --> 27:32.917
YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW
HOW YOU ALWAYS THINK

27:32.960 --> 27:35.747
THE GRASS IS GREENER,
BUT YOU GET THERE, AND IT'S NOT?

27:35.790 --> 27:37.746
WELL, HE'S RIGHT.
HE'S RIGHT.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.167
- HIT YOU LIKE A RAINBOW?
- YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

27:40.210 --> 27:43.441
THE GRASS IS GREENER WHEN WE GET
BACK TO BASICS AT T&S, OKAY?

27:43.480 --> 27:45.687
ALTHOUGH ONE SHOE,
WHICH IS WHAT HE WANTS TO DO,

27:45.730 --> 27:46.719
THAT'S INSANE.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.796
THAT IS IN-SANE--

27:48.830 --> 27:50.149
ONE SHOE.

27:50.180 --> 27:51.693
BUT WE DO HAVE TO GET
BACK TO THE CORE, YOU KNOW,

27:51.730 --> 27:53.379
OF WHAT T&S IS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

27:53.430 --> 27:54.761
- LET ME TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR EYES.

27:54.810 --> 27:55.799
- OW, GOD!

27:55.840 --> 27:58.081
- DOUBLE RAINBOW,
LET ME LOOK AT YOUR EYES.

27:58.120 --> 27:59.326
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO MY FACE?

27:59.360 --> 28:00.839
- WHAT HAVE YOU CONSUMED?
YOU'RE...

28:00.880 --> 28:02.427
YOU'RE WASTED, RIGHT?

28:02.470 --> 28:03.812
- NO, I'M NOT.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.465
- LISTEN, YOU'RE--
ARE YOU STONED?

28:05.510 --> 28:06.886
- COME ON, PLEASE, CROSBY.

28:06.920 --> 28:07.909
IS IT--
WHAT IS THAT?

28:07.960 --> 28:10.292
CAN I HAVE THAT?
- HEY! WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

28:10.340 --> 28:11.432
- MY BOSS
GAVE IT TO ME.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.708
- YOUR BOSS GAVE YOU THIS?
- YEAH.

28:12.760 --> 28:13.784
- YOUR BOSS
GAVE YOU A LOLLIPOP.

28:13.830 --> 28:14.819
- YEAH, IT'S TANGERINE.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.828
- YOU SEE THIS?
- IT'S TANGERINE.

28:16.860 --> 28:18.202
JOEL, TASTE IT.
IT'S TANGERINE.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.138
- I'M NOT GONNA TASTE IT.

28:19.180 --> 28:21.865
- ADAM, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT AN EDIBLE IS?

28:21.900 --> 28:24.903
- I KNOW WHAT
AN EDIBLE COMPLEX IS.

28:24.940 --> 28:26.908
[laughing]

28:26.940 --> 28:28.737
- [laughing]

28:28.770 --> 28:30.180
- JOEL GOT IT.

28:30.220 --> 28:31.733
- YOU DON'T EVEN--
YOU'RE--

28:31.770 --> 28:33.806
BUDDY, YOU'RE...

28:33.850 --> 28:36.114
YOU'RE HIGH.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.491
- EDIBLE MARIJUANA--
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

28:37.540 --> 28:39.940
- THIS IS MEDICINAL MARIJUANA,

28:39.990 --> 28:41.389
AND I DON'T THINK YOU--
- HE DRUGGED ME?

28:41.440 --> 28:43.055
- YES.

28:43.100 --> 28:45.091
- SERIOUSLY,
HE SLIPPED ME A MICKEY?

28:45.130 --> 28:47.849
I'M HIGH.
- YOU'RE HIGH.

28:49.830 --> 28:54.176
- [laughing]

29:13.370 --> 29:14.883
- WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE
THAT THINKS

29:14.920 --> 29:19.402
THAT THIS IS
AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN?

29:19.440 --> 29:21.169
YOU DON'T.

29:21.200 --> 29:24.545
ADAM DOESN'T.

29:24.590 --> 29:26.990
HADDIE DEFINITELY DOESN'T.

29:29.490 --> 29:31.481
I JUST KNOW IN MY GUT,
CAMILLE,

29:31.520 --> 29:32.839
THAT I'M RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

29:32.870 --> 29:34.519
I JUST DO.

29:38.840 --> 29:40.831
I JUST...

29:45.300 --> 29:47.848
[crying]

29:56.550 --> 30:00.919
- WELL, I BROUGHT ADAM
UP HERE, CROSBY, DREW,

30:00.970 --> 30:05.066
AND NOW YOU, GRANDSON.

30:05.110 --> 30:08.557
AND EVERY TIME I'M UP HERE,
IT'S JUST SO BEAUTIFUL.

30:11.460 --> 30:16.045
I WISH THAT MY LIFE
HAD THAT KIND OF CLARITY.

30:22.060 --> 30:23.880
WHEN I GOT BACK
FROM VIETNAM,

30:23.920 --> 30:25.649
MY LIFE WAS A MESS.

30:25.680 --> 30:29.434
I WAS A MESS.

30:29.480 --> 30:32.540
YOUR GRANDMOTHER--
SHE HUNG IN THERE, THOUGH.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.412
SHE JUST LOVED ME, AND...

30:39.520 --> 30:42.489
SHE WOULDN'T LET ME GO.

30:42.530 --> 30:46.216
I THINK SHE SAVED
MY LIFE.

30:46.250 --> 30:50.528
- HAVE WE DONE EVERYTHING
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO?

30:50.570 --> 30:52.629
- WE HAVEN'T HAD
OUR HOT CHOCOLATE YET.

30:52.670 --> 30:55.184
- YOU SAID IF I WASN'T
HAVING A GOOD TIME,

30:55.230 --> 30:56.629
I COULD GO HOME.

30:56.680 --> 31:00.400
- YOU'RE NOT HA\l/\IICN)G A GOOD TIME?

31:00.440 --> 31:02.055
- THAT'S PROBABLY MY FAULT.

31:02.100 --> 31:03.169
I TALK TOO MUCH.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.953
- I JUST REALLY
WANT TO GO HOME.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.161
- WELL, WE GOT TO FINISH
THE MARSHMALLOWS,

31:08.210 --> 31:09.347
AND WE'RE GONNA
COUNT THE STARS.

31:09.380 --> 31:11.063
- I'M DONE
WITH THE MARSHMALLOWS.

31:11.110 --> 31:13.135
- WHAT ABOUT COUNTING
THE STARS?

31:13.180 --> 31:16.513
- I JUST WANT TO GO HOME!
NOW!

31:16.560 --> 31:18.619
I WANT TO GO HOME.
I WANT TO GO HOME.

31:18.660 --> 31:19.524
- HEY, MAX.
- I WANT TO GO HOME!

31:19.560 --> 31:20.936
I WANT TO GO HOME!

31:20.980 --> 31:23.289
I WANT TO GO HOME!
I WANT TO GO HOME!

31:23.320 --> 31:24.708
- MAX!
- I WANT TO GO HOME!

31:24.740 --> 31:27.083
I WANT TO GO HOME!
I WANT TO GO HOME!

31:27.120 --> 31:29.463
I WANT TO GO HOME!
I WANT TO GO HOME!

31:29.500 --> 31:31.559
I WANT TO GO HOME!

31:31.610 --> 31:34.056
- WHAT HISTORICAL TIME PERIOD
WOULD YOU LOVE TO LIVE IN?

31:34.090 --> 31:35.648
- THAT ONE'S SO BORING.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.500
- ANYTHING?
A STEP UP. LET'S--

31:37.550 --> 31:39.051
- WE'RE BACK.

31:39.100 --> 31:39.919
- HI.
- HI.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.928
- GOT ROOM FOR TWO MORE
IN THE GAME?

31:41.960 --> 31:44.167
