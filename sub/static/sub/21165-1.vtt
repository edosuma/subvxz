01:26.086 --> 01:30.089
So as you ladies can see,

01:30.091 --> 01:33.358
by dating a guy like
Johnny football over there,

01:33.360 --> 01:38.730
you stand to loose
$1,900 a year.

01:40.800 --> 01:45.104
Now I don't know about you,
but I don't want to lose $1,900.

01:45.106 --> 01:49.241
And, I know, he seems cool now,
but in like six months,

01:49.243 --> 01:52.478
I guarantee you,
he's gonna be sucking
some guy's dick for money.

01:53.847 --> 01:58.817
I mean, I'm just saying,
dating a guy like me,

01:58.819 --> 02:02.721
the potential return
on that investment--

02:02.723 --> 02:04.323
strong.

02:07.594 --> 02:07.593
Wow.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.665
I'm just-- I'm just gonna go
grab a drink or something.

02:47.800 --> 02:52.671
Oh, my god, Mrs. Hanks.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.839
You tease.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.879
Ajay, operation
Johnson county underway.

03:00.881 --> 03:04.583
I repeat, operation Johnson
county underway.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.920
Do you read me?

03:11.224 --> 03:13.492
What do you-- ajay?

03:18.431 --> 03:20.899
That looks like the worst
Christmas ever.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.568
Is that what you people
do in India?

03:22.570 --> 03:24.603
Dude, I was adopted.

03:24.605 --> 03:25.938
By the way, I've been
meaning to ask you,

03:25.940 --> 03:27.773
how fucking old are you?

03:27.775 --> 03:29.474
Hey, team, listen up.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.977
Now given the configuration
of these numbers there

03:31.979 --> 03:35.814
theoretically, how long would
it take to hold your breath

03:35.816 --> 03:37.583
at the bottom of a ball pit?

03:37.585 --> 03:39.885
What do you mean,
like Chucky Cheese?

03:39.887 --> 03:45.257
That place is for babies,
what are you doing there?

03:45.259 --> 03:47.292
Uh, sweet bleeding Jesus,
i ask myself that

03:47.294 --> 03:50.295
every single day, but that's
another question. Other issues.

03:50.297 --> 03:52.864
Anyway, I want to let you know
about something called,
"summer."

03:52.866 --> 03:55.901
And I know you all want
to get the hell out of here,
i can see it in your eyes.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.704
But summer stands for tanning
and building up your body.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.639
This is something that I know
something about.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.640
It takes discipline.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.309
So please, send me pictures.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.545
Lots and lots
and lots of pictures.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.447
I need to monitor
and track your progress.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.682
I'm sure you all understand.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.651
And I'll give you an example.

04:12.653 --> 04:17.755
Last summer I helped
Johnny here,

04:17.757 --> 04:18.991
very nice,

04:18.993 --> 04:21.293
gain 15 lean pounds.

04:21.295 --> 04:26.331
Johnny was 16 last year.
Pretty sure that's creepy.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.766
And illegal.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.968
All right, soldier,
you stow that right now.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.536
That was last year, okay?

04:31.538 --> 04:33.272
Now since that time
i bought a delorean,

04:33.274 --> 04:35.474
and at 88 miles per hour
i can drive your ass

04:35.476 --> 04:39.845
to your 18th birthday,
is that clear?

04:39.847 --> 04:42.281
Yes.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.615
Uh, can I use the bathroom?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.518
You may, but be careful
of those hidden cameras.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.453
-What?
-Never mind.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.888
Go out. You have
no sense of humor.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.657
You children, what is happening
with you today?

04:53.693 --> 04:55.727
What the hell were you doing?
I told you to use the walkie.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.596
Oh, yeah, I think it was
off or something, I don't know.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.832
Were you in there doing one
of your gay drawings again?

05:00.834 --> 05:05.370
Danny, I'm just nervous about
this whole situation, man.

05:05.372 --> 05:07.039
All right, are you
in the game or not?

05:08.775 --> 05:10.976
Yeah, fuck it.
Why not? I'm in.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.779
All right.
This is gonna be epic.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.781
Since it is the end
of the year

05:15.783 --> 05:17.883
I want to give you
a little bit of magic
from our friend Galileo.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.485
He said that age
is but a number

05:20.487 --> 05:21.953
and numbers
can be manipulated.

05:25.525 --> 05:28.093
Everyone exit, please,
in a orderly fashion.

06:02.729 --> 06:04.029
Stop!

06:09.869 --> 06:12.671
I might butt fuck you

06:12.673 --> 06:13.972
with discipline.

06:18.077 --> 06:19.911
Listen guys, I know
it's the last day and all,

06:19.913 --> 06:21.646
but you really
did it this time.

06:21.648 --> 06:25.417
Imagine all the work you made
for our poor janitor.

06:25.419 --> 06:28.086
Look, honestly,
I'm not even that mad.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.056
But what about all the dildos?

06:31.058 --> 06:32.724
I'll take those home with me.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.092
We have a family reunion
coming up,

06:34.094 --> 06:37.429
so do I have to fill out
tax forms or anything?

06:37.431 --> 06:39.131
Seriously, cut the shit,
both of you.

06:43.102 --> 06:45.504
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.507
You called the cops on us?

06:48.509 --> 06:51.109
Look, you're gonna
find out anyway,

06:51.111 --> 06:54.045
but Chrissy Morgan
was kidnapped

06:54.047 --> 06:55.847
on her way to school
this morning.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.849
There's been others.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.419
Damn, how many girls
are missing?

07:00.421 --> 07:03.021
Chrissy is the third.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.923
Hey, I like you guys,
and if it was up to me

07:04.925 --> 07:07.058
I'd look the other way,
but unfortunately, it's not.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.693
It's up to-- him.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.864
Let's go.
Time to see the big man.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.601
I'll save you some dildos.

07:22.175 --> 07:25.143
Dick puppets.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.779
Dick puppets hanging
from the ceiling?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.781
Are you serious?

07:29.783 --> 07:32.451
What in the hell
were you thinking?

07:32.453 --> 07:34.553
Welcome to Johnson county, sir.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.954
Johnson county?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.722
I'm gonna take that
as a thinly veiled

07:37.724 --> 07:39.624
reference to a cock.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.761
A pee pee.
A dick.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.963
A Peter.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.898
A cornhole impaler.

07:46.900 --> 07:50.235
A cervix crusher.

07:50.237 --> 07:55.907
One hundred percent
all meat thermometer.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.814
Hoo hoo dilly.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.783
I gotta know
which one of you guys
came up with this idea.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.117
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you something,

08:06.119 --> 08:07.819
this thing went down
a little girls throat today.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.155
Do you understand me?
It went deep.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.890
Deep. Deep.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.558
Deep into her throat.

08:15.595 --> 08:17.829
Would you like me
to demonstrate...

08:17.831 --> 08:22.601
This tonsil tickler going down
that little girl's throat?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.236
Not if you're doing
the re-enactment,

08:24.238 --> 08:26.605
but I wouldn't mind
seeing her swallow.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.574
That's real funny.

08:29.576 --> 08:32.611
I am here working my ass off

08:32.613 --> 08:36.648
trying to form
these little girls,
these little boys...

08:38.885 --> 08:42.554
Into the future citizens
of the United States of America.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.054
God bless the U.S.A.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.894
I gotta figure out something.
One of you guys did this.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.829
One of you--
it was your idea.
Was it you, white boy?

08:50.831 --> 08:52.297
Little Caucasian boy?
Was it you?

08:52.299 --> 08:55.033
Was it you Indian boy?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.535
Fucking Indians.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.069
Sir, he's not
that kind of Indian.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.804
-What?
-Sir, he's not--

08:59.806 --> 09:01.940
-he's not that kind
of Indian.
-He's not?

09:04.143 --> 09:05.677
I apologize.

09:05.679 --> 09:09.281
I-- i-- I, habeeb,
i absolutely apologize

09:09.283 --> 09:10.615
from the depth of my heart.

09:10.617 --> 09:12.050
I did not mean to offend you.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.585
You're not that kind
of an Indian.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.786
It's all right.
I understand.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.890
You are the kind of Indian
that talk like this.

09:18.892 --> 09:22.160
You are the kind of Indian
when I need my computer fix.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.697
They route me
over to the dot heads
over there in India.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.933
If they can pull themselves
away from the cobras

09:27.935 --> 09:29.801
in the wicker baskets

09:29.803 --> 09:31.069
playing a skin flute.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.104
Drives those damn snakes crazy.

09:35.274 --> 09:37.642
So while you are
traversing the universe

09:37.644 --> 09:42.047
on a magic carpet ride,
your people are raising

09:42.049 --> 09:44.249
world oil prices everywhere.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.951
You know, I bought
gasoline yesterday.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.619
Five dollars a gallon.

09:47.621 --> 09:51.823
He does get crazy sometimes,
sir, I mean, just, here,

09:51.825 --> 09:54.092
just look at this.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.827
Danny, what the fuck, man?

09:57.296 --> 10:01.900
Good god, young man.
There is a cultural gap here

10:01.902 --> 10:05.370
that definitely
needs to be filled.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.742
I agree completely, sir,
but to be fair,

10:10.744 --> 10:13.378
his village was destroyed
by an elephant stampede.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.379
-Hmm?
-What?

10:14.381 --> 10:15.714
No.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.918
The bad news is
you boys are failing

10:19.920 --> 10:22.020
your classes
for this semester.

10:23.923 --> 10:24.956
Then we can't graduate.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.392
No fucking shit.

10:27.394 --> 10:30.729
-So...
-What's more, I'm gonna
make you pay back the school

10:30.731 --> 10:32.998
for the damages
that you've done.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.968
So basically,
what you're saying,
is that we're fucked.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.639
Let me process
what you just said.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.074
Basically,
what you're saying,

10:43.076 --> 10:45.010
is we're fucked, yes.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.412
-Excuse me, sir.
-What?

10:47.414 --> 10:50.382
-I just had
an interesting idea.
-What's that?

10:50.384 --> 10:53.985
Remember that little thing
we discussed?

10:55.121 --> 10:57.656
Oh, yeah.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.190
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.126
-Uh-huh, I remember
that, yeah.
-Uh-huh?

11:01.128 --> 11:04.195
This may be
a very opportune time
to give it a test run.

11:05.131 --> 11:07.032
I think you're right.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.134
Yeah, I like that.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.908
A test run.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.144
Opportune.

11:19.146 --> 11:22.814
I like opportune test runs.

11:22.816 --> 11:26.084
I'm gonna give them back
to you when I'm done.

11:26.086 --> 11:29.754
Thank you, vice principal
chok-- chug

11:29.756 --> 11:30.989
chokachi.

11:32.191 --> 11:35.960
You got it.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.462
Boys...

11:41.734 --> 11:45.336
I'm very lonely.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.206
The walls are talking to me.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.442
What do they say?

11:50.444 --> 11:53.745
Mostly about my mother's
infidelities.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.214
She had no idea.
Bless her heart.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.819
She thought black men
tasted like chocolate.

12:04.123 --> 12:05.857
One day she comes home
with a little something--

12:05.859 --> 12:08.359
something coming out
of the corners of her mouth.

12:08.361 --> 12:11.229
I said, "mamma, what is that
something something

12:11.231 --> 12:12.964
coming out of the corners
of your mouth?"

12:12.966 --> 12:15.033
And she said I just ate
a fudgesicle.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.501
She could not stay
away from the

12:16.503 --> 12:18.903
black anaconda snake.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.243
I should have known.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.911
When she'd tuck me
in bed at night,

12:26.913 --> 12:28.480
she'd kiss me on the cheek.

12:32.218 --> 12:34.285
And she'd grab my hoo-hoo.

12:40.126 --> 12:46.131
And she'd whisper to me,
she'd go, "good night, Russell,

12:46.133 --> 12:48.767
my love muscle."

12:48.769 --> 12:53.538
Okay, well, we gotta
go home and do that thing

12:53.540 --> 12:55.840
where we tell our parents
what we did.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.942
Yeah, I don't wanna
go unpunished for this.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.979
I'm already getting the urge
to do marijuana.

13:00.981 --> 13:04.315
Mmm, I see.
All right, okay.

13:04.317 --> 13:07.285
Yeah, you guys better run
'cause your lives
are in danger.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.957
Yeah, no, no I love
what you did last night.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.326
Yeah, I'll be there at 6:00.
Yeah, wear that dress again.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.863
Oh, I'll call you back.
Hey, boys! Hold up!

13:18.865 --> 13:22.500
Listen, we have an experimental
mentorship program.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.904
We pair you with a mentor
and you work all summer.

13:25.906 --> 13:29.073
That's it.
And you still graduate.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.176
Wow, sick.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.144
You in?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.412
-Yeah, it sounds great.
-Awesome.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.214
I'll call your mom later
to fill her in.

13:36.216 --> 13:39.250
And boys, please don't screw up
when you're using the guy data.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.152
What did you do?

13:41.154 --> 13:43.021
I had some interesting
experiences

13:43.023 --> 13:45.290
on a certain famous TV show
with Carmen electra

13:45.292 --> 13:46.558
and Pamela Anderson.

13:49.061 --> 13:51.963
It was some crazy shit.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.364
Come on! Get out of here!
Get out of here!

13:53.366 --> 13:54.966
Fist pump it.
Boom, blow it up.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.167
Boom!

13:58.370 --> 14:00.271
Are you there?

14:00.273 --> 14:01.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I'm good.

14:06.545 --> 14:09.447
I am old money.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.083
I am old money.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.586
- I own many horses.
-I own many horses.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.154
The cobbler will know my name

14:16.156 --> 14:18.456
-and he will look me in the--
-the cobbler

14:18.458 --> 14:21.125
- will know my name.
- -When he repairs my shoes.

14:21.127 --> 14:23.161
They will look me in the eyes

14:23.163 --> 14:25.330
when he repairs my shoes.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.866
The cobbler will know my name,
and he will look me in the eyes.

14:27.868 --> 14:32.036
- The cobbler.
- When he repairs my shoes.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.472
Look me in the eyes.

14:34.474 --> 14:38.610
When he repairs my shoes.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.311
I'm old money.

14:48.387 --> 14:52.123
I think-- I think
i might love you.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.362
Ajay, let's go.

14:57.364 --> 15:00.265
Oh, fuck, man!

15:00.267 --> 15:02.500
I was about to score in my dream
and you ruined it.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.435
What did she look like?

15:04.437 --> 15:07.572
Let me guess,
you're the kinda guy
that likes small tits.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.241
Uh, I don't know.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.576
What do you mean
you don't know?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.378
Danny! Ajay!

15:13.380 --> 15:15.480
Uh, boys, downstairs, now!

15:37.569 --> 15:40.538
In your face, thieves!

15:53.185 --> 15:56.688
What the hell
were you two thinking?

15:56.690 --> 15:58.957
None of my dildos
better be missing,

15:58.959 --> 16:00.425
I'll tell you that much.

16:00.427 --> 16:04.162
Oh, well, honey, I checked,
ours are still here.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.297
Well, that's one good
piece of news.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.267
I always knew
you'd be a loser.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.037
Why is Ross here?

16:13.039 --> 16:15.006
Shouldn't you be serving
diarrhea at captain fish?

16:15.008 --> 16:16.975
I'm the second shift
assistant manager.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.110
I don't serve,
but you got served

16:19.112 --> 16:22.413
when I tackled your ass
in the driveway before, bitch.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.216
You got me from behind
and I wasn't even looking.

16:25.218 --> 16:29.153
Hmm! That's not the only thing
you get from behind now, is it?

16:29.155 --> 16:30.989
What the fuck
are you talking about?

16:30.991 --> 16:32.490
Ross is here
to help us figure out

16:32.492 --> 16:34.425
what to do with you two.

16:34.427 --> 16:37.695
That's right, Danny.
Me, you, living room, now!

16:37.697 --> 16:39.397
Let's go.
Get up.

16:42.334 --> 16:46.204
See, ajay? That's what
a brother's supposed to do.

16:46.206 --> 16:49.107
All right, you little fucker,
anybody know?

16:49.109 --> 16:50.475
Nobody knows.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.210
What about your
turban-wearing brother, ajay?

16:52.212 --> 16:54.379
What does he know?

16:54.381 --> 16:57.215
If mom or dad find out
i let you dig out all those
dildos from the dumpster

16:57.217 --> 16:58.483
behind the gloryhole
porn shop,

16:58.485 --> 17:00.451
not only are you
a fucking dead man,

17:00.453 --> 17:01.786
but you can kiss
all those captain fishes

17:01.788 --> 17:03.654
free COD sandwiches good-bye.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.556
You can't take away
my COD sandwiches.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.058
I'm not even rich yet.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.626
I'm living COD platter
to COD platter.

17:08.627 --> 17:11.162
It really warms the heart to see
how much Ross loves Danny.

17:11.164 --> 17:15.098
Yup, that's what I call
brotherly love.

17:15.101 --> 17:17.602
Give a man a fish,
feed him for a day.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.505
Teach a man to fish,
feed him for a lifetime.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.040
You don't even catch fish.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.208
Unless you count fishing
through the freezer.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.777
There are no free lunches.

17:25.779 --> 17:28.246
You should know that already,
Mr. business man.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.515
Now hug me.
They're watching.
Hug me right now.

17:33.285 --> 17:36.821
Ajay, where did you get
all those dildos?

17:36.823 --> 17:42.126
Oh, um, a friend--
a girl. A girl.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.562
Well, you know, Danny is always
talking about penny stocks

17:44.564 --> 17:46.230
maybe he sold off
a few to buy them.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.433
Amazing.
He's our little entrepreneur.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.537
Those two really
love each other.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.072
Yeah, two future
power players

17:54.074 --> 17:55.640
in the midst of a sibling
love embrace.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.408
When I get rich,

17:57.410 --> 18:00.611
I'm gonna buy all
the captain fishes in the world

18:00.613 --> 18:02.547
and fucking fire you.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.816
Now that just sounds
fiscally irresponsible.

18:04.818 --> 18:08.252
Besides, you don't have
the skill or the capital

18:08.254 --> 18:10.121
to ever make that happen.

18:10.123 --> 18:15.093
You're a stupid little virgin
and that's all you'll ever be.

18:17.629 --> 18:19.764
Looks like you two
had a great talk.

18:19.766 --> 18:23.201
I hope you learned something.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.469
I did, mom.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.771
Very good. Very good.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.473
Don't worry, mom.
Don't worry, dad.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.674
I straightened him out.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.442
He's gonna be
a good little boy,

18:31.444 --> 18:33.111
aren't you, Danny?

18:36.615 --> 18:38.716
God damn it!

18:38.718 --> 18:41.319
There's an overturned
shrimp truck on the highway.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.187
- I gotta jet.
- -Thanks, Ross.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.456
You're a good man.
You're a good man.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.724
Love you. Bye.

18:50.262 --> 18:53.264
Vice principal Cho-- ch--

18:53.266 --> 18:54.765
chokachi.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.268
Tells me you two have been
assigned a mentor.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.736
Can mentor these nuts.

18:58.738 --> 19:02.306
Maybe those nuts need
to be mentored, young man.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.908
I wrote down the address.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.911
It's close by.
Some place called,
"fatty's."

19:06.913 --> 19:10.648
Your mentor's name
is Mr. Tyler lavey.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.719
This is one fucking hell
of a salad, honey.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.654
-Thanks, honey.
-It's fucking great.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.322
You guys fucking think
it's fucking great?

19:18.324 --> 19:19.690
This is fucking great.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.481
Yeah?

19:43.483 --> 19:46.417
Hi, we're looking
for Tyler lavrey.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.719
Lavrey?
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.289
No, no, lavey. Lavey.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.357
Lavey. Lavey.
Yeah, lavey.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.625
-Yeah, get in here.
-Sorry, yeah.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.360
You guys fucking meet
muppet babies?

19:56.362 --> 19:57.795
Give me that.

20:03.502 --> 20:05.603
Oh! Gotta feed the meter.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.808
Dude, what the fuck?

20:12.312 --> 20:13.778
Balderdash!
Let's go.

20:15.314 --> 20:16.847
Was that cocaine?

20:16.849 --> 20:18.616
Dude, it smells weird in here.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.386
They're here for you.

20:28.493 --> 20:32.430
Sit the fuck down.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.932
Listen, I thought this
would be a cool thing,

20:34.934 --> 20:37.001
this high school
mentorship program.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.437
You know, a good PR
move for my club,

20:39.439 --> 20:41.672
but I don't wanna hang out
with you two losers.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.842
Look, sir, my name is ajay.
This is my brother, Dan--

20:44.844 --> 20:47.011
I don't care who you are.
You know what?

20:47.013 --> 20:49.447
I'm gonna call
vice principal chokachi

20:49.449 --> 20:50.848
and tell him I'm not cool
with this whole thing.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.717
Look, wait--

20:52.719 --> 20:55.920
look, I'm a strong guy,
you're obviously a strong guy--

20:55.922 --> 20:58.756
are you hitting on me
you little squirt?

20:58.758 --> 21:01.259
All I'm saying is that we can
help you around the bar

21:01.261 --> 21:02.793
and get stuff done.

21:02.795 --> 21:06.397
Hmm, you wanna do
some stuff around the bar.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.798
I don't think so.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.268
My bar is a certain
clientele.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.870
Very exceptional people
come in here.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.940
I don't want them to see me
with you two losers.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.675
Wait.

21:17.677 --> 21:22.046
Look, Tyler, Mr. lavey,
if you don't let us do this,

21:22.048 --> 21:24.515
principal Hanks is gonna
have us by the balls.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.350
That man keeps vaseline

21:26.352 --> 21:28.653
and anal beads
in his front desk.

21:28.655 --> 21:32.390
He will do unspeakable things
to our balls and rectum.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.392
That's fucking gross.

21:34.394 --> 21:37.595
You know what,
i guess I get it.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.597
I'm gonna put together
a little mission list.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.366
Things you have to do.

21:42.368 --> 21:45.636
Complete the list,
and I'll keep you guys around.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.573
-Oh! Oh!
-Mr. lavey, are you okay?

21:49.575 --> 21:53.010
God.

21:53.012 --> 21:56.447
Yeah, sometimes you have to feed
the seed to the birdies.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.916
Thank you.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.951
I'm really fucking busy,
as you guys can tell.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.421
So here's what I'm gonna do.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.589
I'm gonna text the two
of you guys tomorrow

22:05.591 --> 22:08.059
with the first mission,

22:08.061 --> 22:10.528
and it's gonna be
a fucking adventure, boys.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.962
So be ready.

22:26.845 --> 22:30.548
Uh, we're supposed to help
clean up the halls?

22:30.550 --> 22:33.017
Enter, if you dare.

22:35.921 --> 22:38.089
Ladies, pull up a toilet.

22:38.091 --> 22:39.724
Or just sit.

22:39.726 --> 22:44.662
We're to clean up the uh--
dildo dick situation

22:44.664 --> 22:48.065
you got going on there.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.868
Let me just ask--
who flooded my halls

22:50.870 --> 22:53.637
with rubber penises?

22:53.639 --> 22:55.005
That was me.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.408
-In all my years of working--
-look, sir--

22:57.410 --> 22:58.809
-in this shit hole--
-we're really sorry.

22:58.811 --> 23:02.012
I laughed my ass off.
That was pretty amazing.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.682
1500 rubber penises
in the hallway.

23:04.684 --> 23:08.786
I mean, I've cleaned up
like 100, but 1500,

23:08.788 --> 23:12.390
that was like,
it was like a party
at Elton John's house.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.425
Oh, my god. Wow.

23:18.597 --> 23:22.700
Anyway... do you want to play
on z whistle?

23:22.702 --> 23:24.969
Yes, the magic whistle.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.638
Play as a whistle.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.839
Very nice.

23:29.841 --> 23:31.442
Very nice.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.947
Holy shit, man.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.983
--Whatever happened to us--

23:38.985 --> 23:41.185
whatever happened to us
cleaning up the halls?

23:41.187 --> 23:45.055
Oh, bros,
i took care of it, man.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.691
All right?
Life is tough.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.093
I didn't want you guys
to get fucked over.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.694
I mean, look at me.
I'm a janitor.

23:50.696 --> 23:54.765
I'm smoking weed
on a toilet.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.868
I mean, I'm 19 years old.

23:57.870 --> 24:01.038
Look at how hard life is.

24:01.040 --> 24:05.509
I know it's funny to you,
but it's tough, man.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.878
So, consider me
your life guru, all right?

24:07.880 --> 24:10.114
And the purveyor
of the best whistle weed

24:10.116 --> 24:12.116
in this awesome land.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.818
Sweet.
I'm Danny.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.020
-Ajay.
-Was up?

24:16.022 --> 24:17.655
Whatever.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.089
I'm wacon.

24:19.091 --> 24:22.026
Wacon bacon.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.528
Your legal name
is wacon bacon?

24:24.530 --> 24:25.729
There's no fucking way.

24:25.731 --> 24:29.099
Yeah. My parents
did a lot of drugs.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.702
Yeah, wacon bacon, man.
Wake up and toke

24:31.704 --> 24:33.737
right out of my mom's vag.

24:33.739 --> 24:36.941
Yeah, my brother lucked out.
His legal name is Turkey.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.476
Turkey bacon.

24:38.478 --> 24:41.045
And he changed to Kevin,
and became an actor.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.848
Have you seen like
the movie, "tremors"?

24:43.850 --> 24:47.518
Hold on.
You're brothers
with Kevin bacon?

24:47.520 --> 24:48.819
Yeah, I'm his younger brother.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.721
The Kevin bacon?

24:50.723 --> 24:52.957
No, the other Kevin bacon.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.592
What the fuck.
There's only one Kevin bacon.

24:54.594 --> 24:55.926
Jesus Christ.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.728
But yeah, I'm his younger
brother, man.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.196
I uh-- we used
to be really tight

24:59.198 --> 25:02.099
and I went on the set
of "footloose,"

25:02.101 --> 25:04.835
and John lithgow was taking
a nap on set and I farted

25:04.837 --> 25:06.170
in his mouth.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.672
And, uh, nobody thought
that was very funny,

25:08.674 --> 25:09.940
especially lithgow.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.176
He had really
bad breath after that

25:12.178 --> 25:14.211
and ruined a couple scenes.

25:14.213 --> 25:20.017
But anyway, long story short,
you wanna buy some weed?

25:20.019 --> 25:21.519
-Yeah.
-Yeah, sure.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.553
All right, cool.

25:22.555 --> 25:23.954
Can we have the whistle?

25:23.956 --> 25:25.523
Give me my fucking
whistle back, man,

25:25.525 --> 25:27.191
-are you psychotic?
-All right, all right.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.893
Oh, wow, I'm taking a shit.

25:42.741 --> 25:46.610
All right, take out
his text again.

25:46.612 --> 25:48.913
All right,
remember what Tyler said.

25:48.915 --> 25:53.584
I gotta film you picking up
a random girl. No dating sites.

25:53.586 --> 25:57.655
That girl over there,
she looks beautiful.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.758
Bet her personality's
even better.

26:00.760 --> 26:04.028
-Okay, am I good?
-You're sick.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.963
Look at me. You're sick,
you're sick.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.032
-All right. All right.
-Be strong.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.170
Ring ring.

26:15.106 --> 26:16.640
Hello?

26:23.148 --> 26:24.782
All right, I'll tell her.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.784
Um, your pants just called

26:26.786 --> 26:30.921
and they wanna be
on my bedroom floor.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.089
-Really?
-Yeah.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.857
It just rang
and I answered it

26:33.859 --> 26:38.062
and just delivering
the message.

26:38.064 --> 26:40.030
Thanks.

26:47.138 --> 26:48.606
Oh, shit.

26:51.810 --> 26:54.211
There no fucking girls
around here.

26:54.213 --> 26:57.281
No, this place is dry.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.350
Hold on.

26:59.352 --> 27:01.151
That fucking girl's just hot.

27:01.153 --> 27:04.888
-I don't know, man,
she looks like a slut.
-Exactly.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.790
Fucking go over there
and make some like

27:06.792 --> 27:08.626
witty joke or something.

27:08.628 --> 27:11.662
--Just tell her
to leave you alone.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.097
This is ridiculous.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.235
Okay.

27:18.237 --> 27:23.140
Hi, uh, you wanna, um...

27:23.142 --> 27:25.676
You wanna go
to a lumber yard with me?

27:25.678 --> 27:28.012
Looks like you could
use some wood.

27:28.014 --> 27:30.648
-Jerk.
-Asshole.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.851
Oh, look who's a pussy now?

27:47.065 --> 27:49.266
You know, if you have sex
with a handicap guy

27:49.268 --> 27:51.035
you go directly to heaven.

27:52.237 --> 27:55.305
What? You don't wanna
be saved?

27:55.307 --> 27:57.074
Well, I guess you can
go to hell.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.854
My god, I'm saved.

28:26.871 --> 28:30.741
Dude, put that thing out.
What if someone sees?

28:30.743 --> 28:34.712
Dude, I have a cane.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.246
I'm not gonna get arrested.

28:44.823 --> 28:47.925
Oh, my god, I am so sorry.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.993
Nah, don't worry about it,
it's fine.

28:53.131 --> 28:56.133
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

28:59.137 --> 29:00.471
Um...

29:03.308 --> 29:05.109
You know, normally
I'd arrest someone

29:05.111 --> 29:07.911
for smoking marijuana
out in public like this, but--

29:09.814 --> 29:11.849
obviously this is medicinal,
isn't it?

29:11.851 --> 29:14.952
Yes, it's medicinal marijuana.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.887
All right,
be careful with that.

29:16.889 --> 29:20.457
Nobody else gets to smoke that
but him, all right?

29:20.459 --> 29:22.326
-No problem.
-All right.

29:24.329 --> 29:27.831
I'm really sorry.
If you guys want a drink
or some food or something,

29:27.833 --> 29:29.333
I can-- I work here, so--

29:29.335 --> 29:31.168
well, we're Tyler's
new employees.

29:31.170 --> 29:34.505
I'm Danny Kent,
future business mogul.

29:34.507 --> 29:36.774
Power player.

29:36.776 --> 29:39.143
I'm ajay Kent, human being.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.111
You're both kents?

29:41.113 --> 29:42.780
You're not brothers, are you?

29:42.782 --> 29:44.448
Actually, we are.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.484
I would love
to hear that story.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.286
-Maybe some other time.
-Yeah.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.922
Okay, well, I'm Jessica,
Tyler's niece,

29:51.924 --> 29:54.525
so if you guys need anything,
just let me know.

29:58.363 --> 29:59.530
What are you doing
with that cane,

29:59.532 --> 30:01.498
you little pecker?

30:01.500 --> 30:03.433
Oh, my god,
you were faking it?

30:03.435 --> 30:05.102
Oh, my god!

30:05.104 --> 30:06.470
That's pathetic.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.105
Well, get inside
and clean the toilets.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.873
Let's go.

30:15.580 --> 30:17.281
Make me a nice target, babe.

30:20.952 --> 30:22.853
Uh, your ball.

30:26.024 --> 30:27.524
Hold up, hold up.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.059
Almost got it.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.093
Hooyah!

30:30.095 --> 30:31.495
You're an insensitive prick.

30:31.497 --> 30:32.930
That's so cruel.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.932
Did you guys get
what I wanted?

30:34.934 --> 30:37.100
-What?
-The videotapes?

30:38.970 --> 30:41.238
- Not cool.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.174
- Oh, look
who's a pussy now?

30:46.878 --> 30:49.246
You guys are such
fucking losers.

30:49.248 --> 30:50.547
So now that we did
what you asked,

30:50.549 --> 30:52.583
do we have a job or not?

30:52.585 --> 30:54.284
Well, you kinda
did do what I asked,

30:54.286 --> 30:57.054
but you also failed miserably.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.322
So, is that a yes?

30:58.324 --> 30:59.990
Is that a yes?

30:59.992 --> 31:02.092
I have a very big
delivery tonight.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.994
Clients that need
booze for a party.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.230
156 Flanagan.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.564
Here's the address.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.900
Don't be late.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.501
We don't have a car.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.203
I'll have Jessica drive you.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.972
Now get the fuck outta here.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.441
Here's your phone.

31:17.443 --> 31:20.444
And guys, this party's
a little bit kind of weird

31:20.446 --> 31:21.578
from what I've heard,

31:21.580 --> 31:23.881
so get in and get the fuck out.

31:30.421 --> 31:32.356
Okay, load it up.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.393
Nice wheels.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.295
It's not mine.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.430
Why would I drive around
in this weird Van?

31:41.399 --> 31:43.133
Okay, listen, about earlier--

31:43.135 --> 31:44.434
you know what?
Just save it.

31:44.436 --> 31:47.070
Dirtbags like you
are a dime a dozen.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.572
I see them at the bar
every night.

31:49.507 --> 31:52.209
I'm not like them.

31:57.949 --> 31:59.149
It was an honest mistake.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.417
Honest?

32:00.419 --> 32:03.120
You're a pathetic little man.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.488
Whatever.

32:04.490 --> 32:08.058
When I die, people are gonna
love me so much

32:08.060 --> 32:10.661
they're gonna put my body
on top of a mountain,

32:10.663 --> 32:13.330
and an American flag
of hot women,

32:13.332 --> 32:14.998
fucking soaked in oil,

32:15.000 --> 32:16.566
they're gonna mourn my death.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.965
Well, howdy, boys.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.968
Mrs. Hanks, I didn't know
you had such a beautiful home.

32:50.970 --> 32:53.003
Oh, stop with the Mrs. Hanks.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.604
We're not in school.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.407
You can call me Monica.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.142
Okay.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.745
Well, don't just stand there,
you have a job to do.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.553
Just unload it in the kitchen.

33:20.131 --> 33:22.099
For your troubles.

33:25.303 --> 33:29.406
-Wow, thanks.
-Thanks.

33:29.408 --> 33:32.542
Danny, there's something
i need to speak with you about.

33:32.544 --> 33:34.678
It's for school.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.747
Alone.

33:36.749 --> 33:40.017
Oh, all right,
I'll wait in the Van.

33:40.019 --> 33:41.551
See you in the Van.

33:41.553 --> 33:44.654
Danny, I have
an assignment for you.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.490
Will you come with me?

34:11.081 --> 34:13.350
Do you like what you see?

34:13.351 --> 34:14.684
Yes.

34:41.512 --> 34:43.380
Throw me on the bed.

34:51.856 --> 34:53.123
Monica.

34:54.425 --> 34:55.659
Fuck.

35:19.283 --> 35:21.151
Everything okay?

35:21.153 --> 35:23.186
What the fuck took so long?

35:23.188 --> 35:26.189
She wanted me to put it
some place else.

35:26.191 --> 35:27.290
Uh, excuse me?

35:27.292 --> 35:29.326
The drinks.

35:29.328 --> 35:30.594
Forget--
let's just get outta here.

35:31.729 --> 35:33.497
Okay.

35:37.768 --> 35:39.803
Dude, what happened last night?
You seemed off.

35:41.239 --> 35:42.439
I don't know.
It was weird.

35:42.441 --> 35:45.342
Did Mrs. Hanks
touch your pecker?

35:45.344 --> 35:47.144
Actually, no.

35:47.146 --> 35:49.479
But I did hear something
weird going on back there.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.549
Weird?
Like a dude getting
banged in the ass?

35:52.551 --> 35:54.751
Guys! Get back to work!

35:54.753 --> 35:57.154
It's a full fucking bar inside.

35:57.156 --> 35:59.422
Hey, why you guys always dress
in the same shit?

35:59.424 --> 36:01.591
Dress like a man.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.160
Get inside.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.332
-Hell, yeah!
-Ay! Oh!

36:12.770 --> 36:14.704
Two more.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.373
You down with o.P.P.?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.775
You know me, baby angel.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.177
Here, it's for you, sweetheart.

36:20.179 --> 36:21.645
Oh, shit.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.713
Please don't throw money at me.

36:26.417 --> 36:29.653
Two more shots
of your top vodka.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.826
What the fuck are you doing?

36:36.828 --> 36:38.762
What the fuck, bro.
Do I know you?

36:38.764 --> 36:39.796
He was taking a picture.

36:39.798 --> 36:42.499
Ah! Not true.

36:42.501 --> 36:44.301
-What?
-Get the fuck out of here.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.703
You two. Now!

36:46.705 --> 36:48.872
-Whoa!
-You're fucking serious?

36:52.510 --> 36:55.645
That's why you fucking bitches
belong in a god damn strip club.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.381
-Oh, shit.
-Fuck!

36:58.383 --> 36:59.883
Bitch!

37:10.628 --> 37:12.862
I'm sorry for the way
I've been treating you, Danny.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.931
Just forget it.

37:14.933 --> 37:18.468
Maybe we could start over?

37:18.470 --> 37:20.437
Of course.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.272
I'm Jessica goodall.

37:22.274 --> 37:24.441
Jessica, I'm Danny Kent.

37:26.010 --> 37:30.814
Do you wanna go out sometime?

37:30.816 --> 37:33.450
He's only 17.

37:33.452 --> 37:34.985
My mom's nine years
older than my dad,

37:34.987 --> 37:37.954
and I'll be 18 of next week.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.589
Let's go.

37:41.459 --> 37:42.759
Get back to work.

37:45.029 --> 37:46.963
Have you been there
the whole time?

37:46.965 --> 37:48.365
Someone's gotta do the work.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.033
Yeah, someone's
gotta do the work.

37:52.436 --> 37:53.770
Fucking crack head.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.038
Uh!

38:01.946 --> 38:03.980
That's the real
Cunningham pennyfeather.

38:05.983 --> 38:08.018
I'm gonna talk to him.

38:12.490 --> 38:15.558
I own many horses.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.595
Horses?
Horses?

38:18.597 --> 38:21.765
Oh, god, don't say I wandered
into some barn again.

38:21.767 --> 38:24.868
No sir, this is a bar.

38:24.870 --> 38:28.672
A bar?

38:28.674 --> 38:30.407
Well, then.

38:31.475 --> 38:33.410
Can you get me a drink then?

38:33.412 --> 38:35.912
You gonna have the usual,
Mr. pennyfeather?

38:39.083 --> 38:42.552
Well, only if the usual
comes I suppose.

38:42.554 --> 38:43.787
Work a little.

38:43.789 --> 38:46.489
Sweat them up
what you got there.

38:46.491 --> 38:49.959
If you know what I mean.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.696
I don't know what you mean.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.698
Actually.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.667
This young fella here,
you know what I mean.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.035
Oh, yeah.
I know what he means.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.337
He knows.

39:02.506 --> 39:07.510
Sir, I just wanna say
that the power triangle
changed my life,

39:07.512 --> 39:10.113
and it turned me into
the person I currently am.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.348
Well, that's good.

39:11.350 --> 39:13.049
That'll be eight bucks.

39:15.619 --> 39:20.557
Uh, how about you
taking care of this young fella?

39:20.559 --> 39:23.793
From one power triangle
to another,

39:23.795 --> 39:25.428
glad we're here.

39:25.430 --> 39:26.863
The pleasure's all mine.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.399
Thank you, sir.

39:29.401 --> 39:30.934
Get back to work.

39:39.577 --> 39:42.645
Pennyfeather, this better
be worth my time.

39:42.647 --> 39:45.548
I just left my youth
wrestling tournament.

39:45.550 --> 39:48.618
I didn't know you coached.

39:48.620 --> 39:52.088
-Most happy.
-Yeah, coach, yeah?

39:52.090 --> 39:55.592
Well, that's a nice euphemism
for legal child molestation.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.160
Coaching, hell, no.
Those are meat markets.

39:57.162 --> 40:01.030
I go there
for the young gonad.

40:01.032 --> 40:03.666
There you go,

40:03.668 --> 40:06.436
straight from the presses.

40:06.438 --> 40:12.108
Guarantee offered
in the loo, my friend.

40:12.110 --> 40:15.478
What would I do with your pube
little Tome, huh?

40:23.087 --> 40:24.788
I'm kinda down at the moment.

40:24.790 --> 40:30.493
You know i-- I just kinda need
an infusion of cash,

40:30.495 --> 40:31.795
if you know what mean.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.163
I mean, I'll do anything.

40:33.165 --> 40:35.098
Anything.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.733
Now you listen to me,
you old queer.

40:36.735 --> 40:38.101
Don't come on to me
like that, okay?

40:38.103 --> 40:40.937
Damn it, kosta!

40:40.939 --> 40:42.138
My water pesters me.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.840
I've got no where
in this world

40:43.842 --> 40:46.743
where I can sit and get
an iota of comfort.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.745
God, you are really fucking
with my vibe right now,

40:48.747 --> 40:51.147
you know that?

40:51.149 --> 40:53.183
Fine, fine.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.687
Now look, this party
makes the illuminati

40:57.689 --> 40:59.189
look like a bunch of mormons,
okay?

40:59.191 --> 41:02.959
They're real power players,
real men with real cash.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.862
You gotta behave like
someone kind of important.

41:05.864 --> 41:08.231
The address is 256 Flanagan.

41:08.233 --> 41:12.769
Bring your crap
and be ready, okay?

41:12.771 --> 41:14.237
Dude, did you hear that?

41:14.239 --> 41:16.039
It's the same place
we were last night.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.640
So? It's a fucking party
in a mansion.

41:17.642 --> 41:19.476
What do you expect?

41:19.478 --> 41:22.145
Yeah, a mansion where I heard
some guy scream, "Chrissy."

41:22.147 --> 41:24.214
Well, what do you wanna do?
Call the cops?

41:24.216 --> 41:25.949
Are you fucking crazy?

41:25.951 --> 41:29.185
If we find Chrissy Morgan,
we'd be famous.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.220
Why would I?

41:30.222 --> 41:33.056
I promise I will. I will!

41:33.058 --> 41:34.524
And one more thing,
pennyfeather.

41:34.526 --> 41:36.092
Don't even pretend
to be straight.

41:36.094 --> 41:39.162
And don't bring your dead
wife's ashes, please.

41:39.164 --> 41:42.599
Oh, no, Lucy, she'll stay
in the glove compartment

41:42.601 --> 41:43.900
like she always does.

41:43.902 --> 41:48.071
-Yeah. Whatever.
-Thank you. Thank you.

41:48.073 --> 41:50.139
I can see the fucking headlines,

41:50.141 --> 41:53.643
"Kent brothers
find missing girl."

41:53.645 --> 41:56.212
It's fucking iconic.

41:56.214 --> 41:58.281
All right, I see where
you're going with this.

42:09.260 --> 42:10.760
I got an idea.

42:40.824 --> 42:41.858
Thinking what I'm thinking?

42:41.860 --> 42:44.160
Fortunately, yes.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.231
How do I look?

42:48.233 --> 42:50.033
You have the body
of an oil tycoon

42:50.035 --> 42:54.237
and the face of
an 18-year-old virgin.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.072
How about now?

42:56.074 --> 42:57.340
Surprisingly convincing.

42:57.342 --> 43:00.243
But you should
acquire a fake beard.

43:08.652 --> 43:09.752
Fly me--

43:09.754 --> 43:11.254
hey, Danny, you in?

43:11.256 --> 43:13.323
Yeah, just waiting for Justin
to get around back.

43:19.697 --> 43:21.864
Okay, anything I can do?

43:21.866 --> 43:24.634
Email me the Wikipedia page
for pennyfeather.

43:24.636 --> 43:25.802
I don't want to be
caught off guard

43:25.804 --> 43:27.136
if anyone starts
asking questions.

43:27.138 --> 43:29.739
Hey, Danny, be safe,
all right?

43:29.741 --> 43:31.774
Take care of Jessica.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.610
It's gonna be epic.

43:36.113 --> 43:38.781
I am old money.
I own several horses.

43:38.783 --> 43:40.750
The cobbler will know
my name.

43:45.022 --> 43:49.092
Batten down the hatch,
i have arrived.

43:49.094 --> 43:53.329
Oh, my god, Michael j,
it's so good to see you.

43:53.331 --> 43:57.033
Oh! Velour, velour, velour.

43:58.068 --> 43:59.869
Have a good time tonight.

43:59.871 --> 44:03.339
Hi, hi, hi.
Oh, my god!

44:03.341 --> 44:07.143
Oh! It's the lone ranger.
I love a man in a mask.

44:07.145 --> 44:09.078
Oh, my god,
i love a man in a mask.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.880
Where is Tonto?

44:13.751 --> 44:16.653
Oh! Must be Tonto.
Oh, my god.

44:16.655 --> 44:18.721
You were always my favorite.

44:18.723 --> 44:22.759
There must be guns inside.
Can't wait. Oh, my god.

44:24.061 --> 44:25.828
Invitation?

44:55.759 --> 44:57.393
You've reached
the Brian studs hotline.

44:57.395 --> 44:59.996
To begin your sexual journey,
press one.

45:28.892 --> 45:30.727
Show me
the secret sign, please.

45:34.164 --> 45:36.899
What do you like to do, ajay?

45:36.901 --> 45:38.000
I like to draw.

45:38.002 --> 45:40.136
Are you any good?

45:40.138 --> 45:42.839
Yeah, I mean, I got
a full ride scholarship

45:42.841 --> 45:44.207
to fine arts institute.

45:44.209 --> 45:46.409
Are you still in school?

45:46.411 --> 45:48.978
Yeah, I'm a high school senior.

45:48.980 --> 45:52.348
What do I look like
in your mind?

45:52.350 --> 45:56.285
Well, you're probably sitting
next to a microphone,

45:56.287 --> 46:01.824
and you're a musician, so you're
probably slender and artistic.

46:01.826 --> 46:03.860
You're more right
than you think.

46:10.968 --> 46:14.937
Bob! Did you hear that?

46:14.939 --> 46:16.472
What?

46:16.474 --> 46:19.142
Stop messing around, Bob,
i thought I heard someone.

46:19.144 --> 46:21.778
No, honey, I think
you're just being paranoid.

46:22.980 --> 46:24.380
I'm sorry.

46:24.382 --> 46:26.349
I haven't been
sleeping well lately.

46:26.351 --> 46:28.851
I'm just so worried
about the boys.

46:30.254 --> 46:32.455
They're good kids, honey.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.290
They just got a little
carried away.

46:34.292 --> 46:37.160
I'm sure you remember
what it was like
being a teenager

46:37.162 --> 46:41.497
with all those hormones, hmm?

46:41.499 --> 46:42.565
Mmm.

46:44.835 --> 46:48.504
Hey, now, all right.

46:48.506 --> 46:50.439
-Hey.
-Mmm.

46:50.441 --> 46:52.909
So do you remember
how to make a "hormone"?

46:52.911 --> 46:54.944
Oh, yes, I do.

46:54.946 --> 46:57.580
My little Bobby wants
some sugar, mamma bear.

46:57.582 --> 47:01.951
I got some sugar
for papa bear. Come on.

47:01.953 --> 47:04.153
Come to mama.

47:04.155 --> 47:08.257
So that pretty much sums up why
I'm stuck working at a bar

47:08.259 --> 47:13.062
with an overgrown man child
and an undergrown-- child.

47:13.064 --> 47:14.463
I don't mean to interrupt,

47:14.465 --> 47:16.232
but did you say you hung
hundreds of dildos

47:16.234 --> 47:18.601
from the ceiling and the walls
at your school?

47:18.603 --> 47:20.570
Well, my brother, Danny did.

47:20.572 --> 47:22.371
Wow, that's kind of impressive.

47:22.373 --> 47:25.074
I mean, I helped, too.
It was both of us.

47:25.076 --> 47:26.843
Sounds like your brother, Danny,

47:26.845 --> 47:29.178
is over compensating for his
perceived lack of success

47:29.180 --> 47:31.948
by creating situations
to impress those on him.

47:31.950 --> 47:36.285
Yes! Finally! Someone
who understands.

47:36.287 --> 47:38.120
Remember that everyone
has a journey

47:38.122 --> 47:41.224
and must come to a personal
truth at their own pace.

47:41.226 --> 47:43.559
Life is not a sprint,
but a marathon.

47:53.370 --> 47:54.570
Get in here.

47:54.572 --> 47:58.207
Shh.

47:58.209 --> 47:59.976
I can't believe
i agreed to this.

47:59.978 --> 48:01.911
What's the plan?

48:01.913 --> 48:03.613
I don't exactly have one yet.

48:03.615 --> 48:06.182
Oh, that's just perfect.

48:06.184 --> 48:09.452
Okay, how about I stay away
from everything,

48:09.454 --> 48:11.220
if Chrissy Morgan's here
she's isolated from the party.

48:11.222 --> 48:12.655
Okay.

48:12.657 --> 48:15.458
Get out there and mingle,
I'll look for her.

48:15.460 --> 48:17.627
All right.
I'll look for anyone suspicious.

48:17.629 --> 48:19.962
-Okay.
-And Jessica,

48:19.964 --> 48:25.902
if anything happens to you,

48:25.904 --> 48:29.338
all right-- uh,
high five? Good luck.

48:30.274 --> 48:32.108
Fist bump.

49:13.417 --> 49:15.251
This had better
be good, Steven.

49:15.253 --> 49:17.486
Oh, it's gonna be good.

49:17.488 --> 49:19.255
She's almost ready
for the ceremony.

49:19.257 --> 49:20.656
Watch this.

49:22.225 --> 49:23.626
Bow.

49:26.129 --> 49:29.432
Oh, for god's sake.
Bow a little lower

49:29.434 --> 49:31.534
for the madam, please.

49:34.137 --> 49:36.272
That's better.

49:36.274 --> 49:40.009
Now watch this.

49:40.011 --> 49:41.577
First position.

49:45.615 --> 49:47.216
Decent.

49:48.618 --> 49:50.753
Second position.

49:58.062 --> 50:00.629
Unacceptable.

50:00.631 --> 50:02.398
Damn it, Chrissy.

50:04.601 --> 50:09.105
You know, if we really
want to do this right,

50:09.107 --> 50:10.606
I think some deep red dahlias

50:10.608 --> 50:13.075
would accent
the blood vessels.

50:13.077 --> 50:16.712
-No!
-Oh, shut up,
you little slut.

50:16.714 --> 50:19.048
At least you're wearing
a white wedding dress.

50:42.406 --> 50:43.639
Whoa! Whoa! Guys, easy.

50:43.641 --> 50:45.074
Easy, Chrissy!

50:45.076 --> 50:48.077
-Winner, first fall.
-Hey!

50:48.079 --> 50:49.578
Oh, honey, you were great.

50:49.580 --> 50:51.247
Boy, if you had
a fucking dick,

50:51.249 --> 50:52.748
you and me would be good.

50:52.750 --> 50:55.351
Yeah, god.
Nicely done.

50:55.353 --> 50:57.153
Hey, pennyfeather,
get your ass over here.

50:57.155 --> 50:58.487
Help me lube up here.

50:58.489 --> 51:00.256
Here hold this
for me, would you?

51:01.458 --> 51:03.259
Don't drink that shit,
it's lube!

51:03.261 --> 51:06.062
I guess it comes down
to being ashamed

51:06.064 --> 51:07.763
of my disappointing parents.

51:07.765 --> 51:10.533
Sweetie, this isn't
1950 anymore.

51:10.535 --> 51:12.368
If people can't love you
for being who you are,

51:12.370 --> 51:16.172
do you really want them
in your life?

51:16.174 --> 51:19.375
I just don't wanna be
disowned by my parents.

51:19.377 --> 51:21.444
I'm sure if you knew
what your parents were into,

51:21.446 --> 51:23.245
it would shock you.

51:28.853 --> 51:30.786
Papa bear.

51:38.296 --> 51:40.596
Yeah, I guess,
but what about Danny?

51:40.598 --> 51:44.100
I'm sure Danny
will find a way to become
comfortable with this.

51:44.102 --> 51:46.435
What about some nice
bleeding hearts?

51:48.205 --> 51:50.272
You stupid son of a bitch.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.274
If it weren't for me,
none of these girls

51:52.276 --> 51:53.843
would have beautiful
sacrifices.

51:53.845 --> 51:57.113
If it were left up to you,
they would all be just dying

51:57.115 --> 51:59.615
in front of wood paneling
and shag carpeting.

51:59.617 --> 52:01.817
Yes, dear.

52:03.820 --> 52:07.823
You know what?
I forgot to call my sister.

52:07.825 --> 52:11.894
I was gonna ask her about
staying at the lake this summer.

52:11.896 --> 52:14.530
I think the boys would like
a surprise visit to the lake.

52:16.267 --> 52:18.334
Who's this on my phone?

52:21.171 --> 52:24.206
Get off my phone, freak!

52:24.208 --> 52:25.808
No, I'm not gone.

52:25.810 --> 52:28.277
Get your butt downstairs
right now, mister.

52:32.883 --> 52:35.484
Ajay, were you
getting catfished?

52:35.486 --> 52:36.819
What?
I don't--

52:36.821 --> 52:38.487
do you even know
what that means?

52:38.489 --> 52:41.357
Now, son, now we only want
what's best for you.

52:41.359 --> 52:43.159
Listen, I know what I heard.

52:43.161 --> 52:45.194
And if this is another one
of yours and Danny's pranks,

52:45.196 --> 52:46.829
I want it to stop now.

52:46.831 --> 52:48.597
-But mom--
-but nothing.

52:48.599 --> 52:51.267
Your father and I work
too hard to keep you kids fed

52:51.269 --> 52:52.635
with a roof over your heads.

52:52.637 --> 52:53.936
I expect this from Danny.

52:53.938 --> 52:55.237
Not you, ajay.

52:55.239 --> 52:57.339
Speaking of--
where is he?

52:57.341 --> 52:58.641
Go get him.

52:58.643 --> 53:01.510
Oh, uh, he told me
he wasn't feeling well.

53:01.512 --> 53:02.611
I think he already
went to bed.

53:02.613 --> 53:04.847
I don't care.
Go get him.

53:06.349 --> 53:08.784
My god, I picture you
with six inches of cock

53:08.786 --> 53:09.885
and bullets the size
of Rhode Island,

53:09.887 --> 53:10.920
you hear me?

53:10.922 --> 53:12.421
That's beautiful, well done.

53:12.423 --> 53:13.589
I gotta take this.
I gotta take this.

53:13.591 --> 53:14.757
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:16.226 --> 53:19.261
Dude, you just saved me
from the weirdest shit.

53:19.263 --> 53:21.297
It's mom. She wants
to see you now.

53:21.299 --> 53:22.565
Well, how can
i do that, ajay,

53:22.567 --> 53:24.266
when I'm Cunningham pennyfeather

53:24.268 --> 53:26.835
surrounded by a bunch
of oiled up muscle chicks?

53:26.837 --> 53:28.737
What?
Where are you?

53:28.739 --> 53:30.573
Okay, look, stall mom,

53:30.575 --> 53:32.208
and I'll be home
as fast as I can.

53:32.210 --> 53:33.776
Ajay, get over here now!

53:38.648 --> 53:39.815
Chrissy!

53:41.384 --> 53:42.384
Stop that!

53:42.386 --> 53:43.953
Somebody stop her!

53:43.955 --> 53:45.554
-Stop her!
-Sorry.

53:45.556 --> 53:48.390
We've got an imposter!
We've got an imposter!

53:48.392 --> 53:49.792
Let me--

53:49.794 --> 53:51.927
--stop him! Stop him!

53:51.929 --> 53:53.696
- Go!
-He's got my clothes on, stop him.

53:53.698 --> 53:56.765
-Police!.
-He's got my clothes on,
stop him! Stop him!

53:58.335 --> 54:00.869
Danny Kent, what in the fuck
are you doing here?

54:00.871 --> 54:02.605
Catch you little prick!

54:02.607 --> 54:05.441
-I'm getting you,
-you little cock sucker.
Stop him!

54:05.443 --> 54:08.244
-Do you hear me?
-Stop the man!
Stop him!

54:12.549 --> 54:14.483
Mom, he's uh,
he's got the shits.

54:14.485 --> 54:15.985
He's shitting real bad up there.

54:15.987 --> 54:18.287
I think he ate that COD meal.

54:18.289 --> 54:19.755
Okay, well, ask him
if he wants me

54:19.757 --> 54:21.490
to make him some tea
for his tummy.

54:21.492 --> 54:24.360
But as soon as he's done,
to get his rear down here.

54:24.362 --> 54:25.527
Okay, will do, will do.

54:25.529 --> 54:27.563
I'll get him right away.

55:01.431 --> 55:03.599
Okay, here comes lavey.

55:03.601 --> 55:05.567
Tyler, dude, where are you?

55:14.344 --> 55:16.445
Tyler, dude, where are you?

55:16.447 --> 55:18.414
I'm pretty sure I found
Chrissy Morgan.

55:18.416 --> 55:20.683
Oh, yeah, and Jessica
might have been kidnapped.

55:20.685 --> 55:21.750
Okay, bye.

55:21.752 --> 55:22.918
Hurry up, come in.

55:26.589 --> 55:28.590
I wanna go on the record
for being totally against this.

55:28.592 --> 55:30.326
Did you want mom to catch you?

55:30.328 --> 55:34.330
Boys, be here, now!

55:34.332 --> 55:35.798
What the hell, boys?

55:35.800 --> 55:37.366
Just when I think things
cant get any worse,

55:37.368 --> 55:38.834
you pull this crap.

55:38.836 --> 55:42.438
- Mom, you don't understand.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.340
I wonder who
it could be at this hour.

55:44.342 --> 55:45.908
I don't know, go check, Bob.

55:52.949 --> 55:54.350
It's a police officer.

55:54.352 --> 55:56.618
Christ, what did
you kids do now?

56:02.726 --> 56:05.094
Hi, officer.
What can I do for you?

56:05.096 --> 56:07.062
I can't believe
you hired an escort.

56:07.064 --> 56:09.965
Who even delivers
at this hour?

56:09.967 --> 56:12.134
Well, you're not
a real police officer.

56:12.136 --> 56:14.870
I'm not here to dance.

56:17.640 --> 56:20.008
This is how this is
about to go down, you see?

56:29.620 --> 56:31.019
Who is that?

56:31.021 --> 56:33.088
Why the fuck are you
throwing carrots?

56:36.493 --> 56:38.761
Give me the orange.

56:50.974 --> 56:53.776
Guys, come on, let's go.

56:55.945 --> 56:57.079
Where are you taking them?

56:57.081 --> 56:58.113
-What?
-What are you doing?

56:58.115 --> 56:59.448
Wait!

57:05.722 --> 57:07.756
Come on, this way.

57:18.701 --> 57:19.902
Damn it.

57:25.842 --> 57:28.010
Did you do as I asked?

57:31.481 --> 57:32.981
And who might that be?

57:38.655 --> 57:41.089
Oh, terrific!

57:41.091 --> 57:45.194
Just one day before the biggest
sacrificial offering

57:45.196 --> 57:47.196
in the history
of secret societies

57:47.198 --> 57:50.165
and we have three
men who know too much.

57:54.604 --> 57:58.874
The most wealthy, powerful men
in the known universe

57:58.876 --> 58:01.777
are going to be here
tomorrow night.

58:01.779 --> 58:04.813
Men, who, mind you, are paying
me good money to be a part

58:04.815 --> 58:09.017
of sacrificial offerings.

58:09.019 --> 58:12.721
We must not let these kids
foil our plans.

58:17.026 --> 58:18.894
Just kill them.

58:21.631 --> 58:22.965
Where are we?

58:22.967 --> 58:25.968
You ask way
too many questions, kid.

58:25.970 --> 58:27.569
-Too many questions?
-Yeah.

58:27.571 --> 58:29.938
I think now
is the perfect time

58:29.940 --> 58:33.542
to ask many, many,
many fucking questions.

58:33.544 --> 58:35.577
My girl's in danger.

58:35.579 --> 58:37.713
Your girl?
You mean my niece?

58:37.715 --> 58:39.581
The one you dragged
into this mess

58:39.583 --> 58:41.517
because you couldn't mind
your own business?

58:41.519 --> 58:43.218
Guys, look.

58:43.220 --> 58:44.753
We're in imminent danger

58:44.755 --> 58:47.089
and you bring us to see
an old fucking lady.

58:47.091 --> 58:48.757
What, is she going
to give us a cough drop

58:48.759 --> 58:48.757
and tell us how polio was?

58:48.759 --> 58:52.027
That's my grandmother
and she can hear you.

58:52.029 --> 58:54.062
Guys, shut the fuck up,
all right?

59:05.275 --> 59:09.044
-We're here because, uh--
-i know.

59:09.046 --> 59:12.548
So what are you
gonna do about it?

59:12.550 --> 59:14.883
Oh, um, that's why
we're here.

59:14.885 --> 59:16.285
I see.

59:16.287 --> 59:17.786
Get rest.

59:19.022 --> 59:21.823
You're gonna need it.

59:23.626 --> 59:26.161
Insecurity.

59:26.163 --> 59:28.163
Lack of self understanding.

59:28.165 --> 59:32.134
And most prominently,
a fear of the truth.

59:32.136 --> 59:34.169
These are all
human attributes.

59:34.171 --> 59:36.204
Attributes I see
in the three of you.

59:46.249 --> 59:48.317
Oh, what is that?

59:48.319 --> 59:49.785
Bunch of pussies.

59:59.362 --> 01:00:02.097
The sooner you set
yourselves free

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.899
the sooner we can
free Jessica.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.741
Unity amongst you
is beautiful

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:15.744
and will grow stronger
with time and trust.

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:22.718
Now whether Tyler told you,
i raised Jessica.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.021
She is an amazing
young bright woman,

01:00:26.023 --> 01:00:28.624
and she means
the world to me.

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:29.992
You know where she is?

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:31.960
I know where she is.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.295
We need knives and guns.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:35.197
No guns, no knives.

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:39.301
When I was a secret agent I used
only unconventional tactics,

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:41.203
things no one had ever seen.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:45.207
Where do we find such things?

01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:48.243
Within yourselves.
Team work together.

01:00:48.245 --> 01:00:51.079
Let the synergy be your guide.

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:52.948
The three of you
make a triangle.

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:55.350
The power triangle.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:58.220
I have faith in you three.

01:00:58.222 --> 01:01:00.756
On the count of three,
let's do a power triangle.

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:03.992
One, two, three.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:05.661
Power triangle.

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:08.830
Everything okay?

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:10.832
Now press the envelope
and deliver.

01:01:14.704 --> 01:01:15.904
Let's get epic.

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:48.103
There's our man right there.

01:01:48.105 --> 01:01:50.272
There's our man.
This man will hate you.

01:01:50.274 --> 01:01:52.074
When we're on, we're good.

01:01:53.177 --> 01:01:54.376
Throw my money.
Get my money.

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:56.445
This is my money.

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:58.146
You're a pathetic
little man.

01:01:58.148 --> 01:01:59.948
Your greed sickens me.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:01.216
You don't--
you don't understand

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:03.051
the power
of the triangle, kid.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:05.721
No, you don't understand
the power of the triangle.

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:09.858
Go to sleep, old man.

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:27.142
I'm going in.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.912
Shit, I don't have my phone.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.380
Here, take mine.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:35.450
Thanks, bro.

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:38.487
Bro? Since when
do you call me bro?

01:02:38.489 --> 01:02:40.489
This is the first time I feel
like I've been one to you.

01:02:40.491 --> 01:02:41.923
I expect to hear
a lot more then.

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:44.259
Listen, enough of this,
you two love birds.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:47.829
When you locate Jessica,
you text us.

01:02:47.831 --> 01:02:49.464
We got your back.

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:05.480
Ticket.

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:11.119
Uh, I left it in my delorean
next to my flux capacitor.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:14.389
Very funny, kosta,
used that line last night.

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.291
I still need a ticket.

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:26.001
Enjoy your evening, sir.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:37.445
Kosta, your presence
is requested.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.911
This is your night.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.216
Why are you
doing this to me?

01:04:14.218 --> 01:04:16.618
All because...

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:21.590
I wanna make you look...

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:25.493
Fabulous, yeah.

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:31.566
- Mmm...Mmm...
That's pretty.

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:38.874
This was my mother's
wedding dress.

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:45.914
She wore it.

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:49.618
You know, she liked
little boys.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:54.956
She couldn't help herself.

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.197
Neither can I.

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:42.604
Well, well, well, Mr. Jeremy.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:45.307
I love watching you swallow.

01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:47.375
What's going on up there?

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:50.045
Just a porn star
choking the chicken.

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:06.494
For god's sakes, what's that
fucking yeti doing here?

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:14.970
How does he stand
the heat at night?

01:06:14.972 --> 01:06:17.439
Those pecs are like
steamed vegetables.

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:36.591
Kosta! Hi!
This is my friend, kosta.

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:38.326
Everybody meet kosta.

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:40.028
Kosta meet everybody.

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:49.571
Hey, kosta, you ever give
a little kid a used condom,

01:06:49.573 --> 01:06:51.139
and tell him
it was a go-gurt.

01:06:51.141 --> 01:06:52.140
Oh!

01:06:52.142 --> 01:06:53.441
Seems a little fucked up.

01:06:53.443 --> 01:06:56.344
-That is fucked up.
-Oh, excuse me.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:59.481
Aren't you standing tip toe
on your high horse today!

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:04.285
Seems a little disrespectful.

01:07:04.287 --> 01:07:07.789
This from a guy who rationalizes
having sex with minors,

01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:10.458
by bragging you have the highest
test scores in the state!

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.193
Like that's gonna
justify it.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:14.062
Hey, you gotta admit those
'cause they're limping off

01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:16.231
-to a brighter future.
-That's why I love you, potsie.

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:18.666
Come here, you slime ball.
Let's have a private moment,

01:07:18.668 --> 01:07:19.801
come here, come here.

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:22.437
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:24.139
You're not a bad guy,
you need a black hat.

01:07:24.141 --> 01:07:25.240
You need some love.

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:30.745
Kosta, what do you think
of the girls you got here?

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:32.814
-Fucking girls.
-Pretty sexy, huh?

01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:34.516
-Oh, that--
-yeah, I'd love to--

01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:36.751
I mean, no, no,
my penis is like kix.

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:38.753
Kid tested mother approved.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:41.489
-Oh, it is,
it's mother approved.
-And he's right it is.

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:43.091
-Faster, you're getting soft.
-My mother approved.

01:07:43.093 --> 01:07:44.659
-You're getting soft. In fact--
-maybe too soft.

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:47.195
-I think a little too soft.
-Maybe.

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:56.404
They all have masks.

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:58.406
Check this out.

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.811
You're getting soft, kosta.

01:08:02.813 --> 01:08:05.380
Perhaps a little too soft.

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:10.618
Ah! Oh, my god.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.487
You know, we have a strong
policy about intruders here.

01:08:12.489 --> 01:08:14.856
You picked the wrong
party to crash.

01:08:14.858 --> 01:08:16.791
Hold him, Ron.
I'll get the gun.

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:19.359
Well, make it quick.
I wanna keep this festive.

01:08:19.362 --> 01:08:20.662
Yeah, right.

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.863
Cut it out!
Just lie there, will ya?

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:24.365
Now who are you?

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:26.100
-I'm kosta.
-You're not kosta!

01:08:26.103 --> 01:08:27.769
I'm looking at your face,
you idiot.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.370
What brings you
to this party?

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:30.572
Why are you here?

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:34.341
Oh, no, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:35.810
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:37.879
Who's this?

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.685
Is this miracle
lamentations of love?

01:08:43.687 --> 01:08:49.524
Miracle lamentations of love.

01:08:49.526 --> 01:08:54.261
Oh! It's Eric, baby, hi.

01:08:54.264 --> 01:08:55.462
I know.

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:57.899
I wanna--
i wanna talk to him.

01:08:57.901 --> 01:09:01.703
Hi, I have a big cock
and I like to get a nice
ball suck massage.

01:09:01.705 --> 01:09:04.471
Look, I'm sitting here,
my penis is out parking the car.

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:09.444
The eagle society
secret wealthy group

01:09:09.446 --> 01:09:13.881
of prominent homosexual men
with mommy issues,

01:09:13.884 --> 01:09:16.618
often blaming the infidelities
of their mothers

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:19.220
as the root of their
unhappiness.

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:21.356
It's very encyclopedic.

01:09:21.358 --> 01:09:22.790
Seems too straightforward.

01:09:22.792 --> 01:09:25.859
Like a suppository
for a secret book.

01:09:25.862 --> 01:09:27.328
Well, maybe the guys
that wrote this thing

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.796
were on a tight deadline.

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:31.666
So I have a problem
with premature ejaculation.

01:09:38.573 --> 01:09:42.210
Hey, why are you giving
Ron Jeremy my phone?

01:09:42.212 --> 01:09:43.810
Not that I mind
where his hands have been.

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:46.180
Who cares about
the fucking phone?

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:49.417
Any ideas where my niece is?

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:52.620
I got an idea.

01:09:56.293 --> 01:09:57.892
Let the games begin.

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:04.766
Gentlemen, tonight we put
an end to the ghost

01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:06.301
of our mothers' judgment.

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:11.806
No longer
will we be judged

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:13.908
for the choices
that we've made.

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:16.811
Choices that were made
that were predetermined

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:18.913
before we came out
of our mother's womb.

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.585
Let the sacrifice begin.

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:41.970
Dude, you're homosexual,
why didn't you tell me?

01:10:41.972 --> 01:10:44.405
You? How could
i possibly tell you?

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:46.541
All you care about
is material things,

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:47.809
how people perceive you.

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:49.444
How can I be honest with you?

01:10:49.446 --> 01:10:52.547
You're not even honest
with yourself, Danny.

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:53.881
Fucker.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:02.390
You know, Sonny,
you've always been

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:04.292
a disappointment to me.

01:11:04.294 --> 01:11:06.995
I expect that from sons
who wet the bed

01:11:06.997 --> 01:11:08.963
until age 15.

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:11.399
If your mothers
could see you now.

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:14.435
Oh, yes, they can.

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:18.439
You should always carry a piece
of your mother in your heart.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:21.442
It's picture school day
and you're not even dressed

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:22.677
to impress.

01:11:22.679 --> 01:11:24.412
You better smile, you--

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:25.613
oh, fuck!

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:29.350
Get over there.

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:31.319
Everybody back the fuck off

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:33.454
or you're gonna get
an ass full of lead.

01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:36.724
And to clarify,
this is a deadly weapon.

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:38.393
I'm not talking
about any kind

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:39.927
of kinky stuff.

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:45.900
What did you do
with my mistress?

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:50.872
You can say she's waking up
to some harsh realities.

01:11:57.614 --> 01:11:59.480
Nah, this is my favorite one.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.349
Got it from a blind guy.

01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:02.950
That's an apple, you idiot.

01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:06.020
Oh, yeah, did you hear me
just mention that he's blind?

01:12:06.022 --> 01:12:08.022
God, for a mistress
of the secret society,

01:12:08.024 --> 01:12:11.426
you're a fucking stupid whore.

01:12:11.428 --> 01:12:13.394
You know, if this doesn't
work out, Mrs. Hanks,

01:12:13.396 --> 01:12:15.763
-maybe you and--
-save your words, kosta,

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:18.333
a person like me would never
sleep with a troll like you.

01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:19.701
No, no, no, no, no,

01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:21.536
that's not what I was
talking about, my dear.

01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:23.104
I was talking about
a teaching reference

01:12:23.106 --> 01:12:26.441
for an elementary school,
you're 35 years too old for me.

01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:28.843
I am 42.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:31.079
Exactly.

01:12:31.081 --> 01:12:32.547
Can I jerk off on your tits?

01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:33.581
No!

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:37.919
I was talking to him.

01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:40.555
I can pay you
in rubber penises.

01:12:40.557 --> 01:12:43.124
-Absolutely.
-Nice.

01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:46.794
The oakwood community can all
sleep a little easier now

01:12:46.796 --> 01:12:48.930
thanks to three men,
that choose to only

01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:51.132
be referred to
as the power triangle,

01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:53.901
a young woman was rescued
from captivity.

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:57.038
The perpetrators,
oakwood high school principal,

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.375
Steven Hanks, and his wife,
psychologist, Monica Hanks,

01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:02.143
are being held for questioning.

01:13:02.145 --> 01:13:05.113
Once again,
it's seems as though
good has prevailed.

01:13:05.115 --> 01:13:06.848
We'll be here bringing you
up to the date coverage

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:08.916
as soon as it
becomes available.

01:13:08.918 --> 01:13:12.920
This is Sofia Briley
signing off for oakwood news,
channel three.

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:19.861
-Hey guys, you did it.
-No, we did it.

01:13:19.863 --> 01:13:22.897
And now that I'm 18,
we're gonna do it.

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:25.533
That's my boy.

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:28.703
Hey, where's Ross?

01:13:28.705 --> 01:13:30.138
Well, the busy buddy
couldn't make it.

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.974
He's too busy doing R&D
on a new lobster sandwich.

01:13:32.976 --> 01:13:37.412
Hey, guys,
congratulations,
we did it.

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:43.451
Guys, I just gotta
say something,

01:13:43.453 --> 01:13:47.655
if ajay wasn't gay,
I'd be dead right now,

01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:50.024
and for that,
I'm forever grateful

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:51.759
to his homosexuality.

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.898
I've got a surprise for you.

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:14.182
Ajay, I have never been
more proud of you

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:16.884
than I am in this moment.

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:18.853
Thanks, dad.

01:14:18.855 --> 01:14:20.822
I can't wait to gossip
with you and catch up

01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:22.223
on the soap operas.

01:14:22.225 --> 01:14:26.494
Anyway, listen, drinks
on the power triangle.

01:14:26.496 --> 01:14:28.062
Cheers.

01:14:29.164 --> 01:14:32.233
Hold on,
power triangle?

01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:33.501
I don't have any money.

01:14:33.503 --> 01:14:35.636
It's all right,
trust me,

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:37.004
I've got something
to show you guys.

01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:38.506
Let's go check it out.

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:40.975
Come on.

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:48.883
Take a look.

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:53.754
This is amazing, Tyler,
thank you.

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:56.491
Can I redesign the interior?

01:14:56.493 --> 01:14:57.992
Of course, it's yours.

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:01.929
All right, guys,
on the count to three

01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:02.964
let's do a power triangle.

01:15:02.966 --> 01:15:04.799
Let's do it.

01:15:04.801 --> 01:15:07.935
-One, two--
-whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

01:15:07.937 --> 01:15:10.705
Always treat Jessica
like a Princess.

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:12.173
I will.

01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:14.208
-Three--
-power triangle!

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:17.278
Hey, hey, hey.

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:22.216
-Hey.
-Hey, that's mine.

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:23.618
Shut up.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.187
That's mine!
You can't take that!

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:32.159
-Knock it off.
-No, I fight back.

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:37.899
-Grab his legs.
-Got it.

01:15:37.901 --> 01:15:39.834
Oh, this guy.

01:15:46.775 --> 01:15:48.609
Good thing.
