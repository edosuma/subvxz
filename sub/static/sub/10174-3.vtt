00:00.386 --> 00:01.658
And we're going forward.

00:01.693 --> 00:03.604
Two, three, four.

00:03.723 --> 00:04.721
And let's reverse it.

00:04.807 --> 00:07.057
Two, three, four, that's great.

00:07.193 --> 00:08.559
Whoa, are we DJs right now?

00:08.693 --> 00:10.227
What are we doing? I don't know.

00:12.148 --> 00:14.114
- This is hard, right?
- This is hard.

00:14.233 --> 00:16.867
Let's take it from a ten to a three.

00:16.953 --> 00:18.903
Uh-oh, I'm a bird.

00:18.988 --> 00:20.738
Flying to Florida, woo!

00:20.873 --> 00:22.046
- Flying to Florida.
- Squints!

00:22.081 --> 00:25.159
Squints! Everybody, out of the pool!

00:25.244 --> 00:27.411
Come on! You can make it!

00:27.797 --> 00:29.135
You can do it!

00:29.170 --> 00:30.915
Breathe, breathe!

00:31.000 --> 00:32.917
- Come on, breathe, breathe.
- Come on!

00:33.002 --> 00:35.609
Oh, he's lying, Abbi.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.159
He's a dirty liar.

00:37.194 --> 00:39.258
Squints, are you fucking kidding me?

00:39.293 --> 00:41.058
Dude, you did this three weeks ago.

00:41.143 --> 00:44.433
One more time and I am
leaving you in the pool to die.

00:44.468 --> 00:45.479
Damn it.

00:45.598 --> 00:48.735
I'll save you, Squints, that's
the reason I tattled on you.

00:49.984 --> 00:53.344
Okay, guys. Class dismissed. I'll
see you on Thursday, though, right?

00:53.379 --> 00:55.013
Great, it was a great class, guys.

00:55.048 --> 00:56.457
Everyone except Squints, that was great.

00:56.492 --> 00:57.693
Abbi? Listen.

00:58.411 --> 01:01.085
I know how to do it
without popping your cherry.

01:01.120 --> 01:01.819
Come on.

01:01.820 --> 01:04.279
Your husband will never
suspect on your wedding night.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.291
You know that I know your granddaughter.

01:06.326 --> 01:07.687
I'm texting her right now.

01:35.114 --> 01:36.469
I'm doing stuff, I'm working.

01:36.470 --> 01:39.717
No, I e-mailed you last night
in a very large, bold font,

01:39.802 --> 01:41.168
saying not to come in today.

01:41.253 --> 01:43.220
Did you e-mail
IlanaWexler@MindMyVagina.com?

01:43.305 --> 01:45.172
I refuse to use that e-mail
address, you know that.

01:45.257 --> 01:46.911
I'm legal, Todd.

01:47.560 --> 01:50.010
Look, there's an investor coming
today. This is very important.

01:50.096 --> 01:53.163
- We need the second round of funding...
- Dude, this means money.

01:53.198 --> 01:57.153
Because I have a bazillion app ideas
that some crusty old white douche

01:57.188 --> 01:59.691
would jizz his little pantsuit for.

01:59.772 --> 02:00.963
Dis good.

02:00.998 --> 02:02.627
- Dis real good.
- Go home.

02:02.942 --> 02:05.277
- You're wearing a dog hoodie.
- Chill, Miss Thang.

02:05.312 --> 02:08.027
This isn't a dog hoodie. It's from the
dog owner's section of American Apparel...

02:08.114 --> 02:09.947
It has ear holes for dog ears.

02:10.032 --> 02:12.282
Why would they do that in a
hood? A hood is to cover a head.

02:12.418 --> 02:13.867
Is there a pocket on the back?

02:13.953 --> 02:15.502
There is. Also has a leash hole.

02:15.621 --> 02:17.245
Not the first time
this has happened to me.

02:17.280 --> 02:20.931
Three other times. I'm gonna fix this
and we are both gonna be billionaires.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.339
No. Chamillionaires.

- Oh, thanks Trey.

02:42.231 --> 02:43.981
You know, before you were a
trainer, everybody goofed on me

02:44.116 --> 02:46.120
so hard for decorating my locker.

02:46.202 --> 02:47.484
Yeah, I need to.

02:47.570 --> 02:50.204
It's like, I need to curate
my space and, it's like,

02:50.322 --> 02:52.406
a vision board, you...
You know what I mean?

02:52.491 --> 02:56.126
Because it's like, I put my stuff in it.

02:56.212 --> 02:57.819
That's why I have to do it.

02:57.854 --> 03:00.047
Exactly, you know? It's
so boring not to decorate.

03:00.166 --> 03:03.215
I just want to get in here, Axe my
body from head to toe and then...

03:03.250 --> 03:04.218
- Zen out.
- Zen out.

03:04.336 --> 03:05.469
- Jinx!
- Jinx!

03:05.554 --> 03:06.970
I was gonna say jinx.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.222
Oh. We're buds.

03:08.340 --> 03:11.341

03:30.967 --> 03:32.446
No, I'm totally at ease.

03:32.531 --> 03:34.498
Cool.

03:34.583 --> 03:36.503
- Where is it?
- It's just by the shower.

03:36.538 --> 03:39.203
I might check it out, just to,
like, see what... Spacially...

03:39.338 --> 03:43.040
Yeah, sorry.

03:43.175 --> 03:45.259

Woo!

05:04.673 --> 05:05.622

05:05.708 --> 05:08.041
Oh, yeah, your first Soulstice games.

05:08.127 --> 05:10.260
Wow. I remember my first time.

05:10.346 --> 05:13.621
I was 23 and I had just found
out I was allergic to cashews.

05:13.656 --> 05:16.133
Cool, uh... I don't think
that I should participate.

05:16.218 --> 05:17.626
Oh, no, you'll be great,
you'll fit right in.

05:17.661 --> 05:19.553
No, um... I get...

05:19.638 --> 05:22.973
I get a little intense
about competition.

05:23.108 --> 05:25.466
In high school, people used
to call me Tonya Harding.

05:25.501 --> 05:27.746
Don't worry about it. It's not
about who wins and loses, you know?

05:27.781 --> 05:29.947
It's just about team building.
There's no "I" in "Soulstice."

05:30.032 --> 05:31.565
- But there's...
- Well, yes, there is, yes.

05:31.650 --> 05:34.851
I've actually been trying to get them
to change it to a "Y" for a long time.

05:35.154 --> 05:37.160
Anyway, you're gonna have
fun. Plus, it's mandatory.

05:37.195 --> 05:39.122
All right, weigh-in
starts in ten, you guys,

05:39.208 --> 05:43.160
so you still got time to shave your
pubes if you need to lose that last L-B.

05:43.295 --> 05:45.943
There's where the
fucking pubes come from.

05:50.727 --> 05:52.310
It's a crowded market out there.

05:52.445 --> 05:54.862
Groupon, LifeBooker, Yippit,

05:54.981 --> 05:56.647
JewDeal, GroupSwoop.

05:56.733 --> 05:59.430
What makes Deals, Deals,
Deals different, hmm?

06:00.887 --> 06:02.437

06:08.728 --> 06:10.672
Our company hasn't tweeted in six days.

06:10.707 --> 06:12.461
What's worse, it's just a link.

06:12.496 --> 06:13.564
No voice, no copy.

06:13.650 --> 06:16.256

lettuce for fingers,

08:06.346 --> 08:08.262
Let's just hold on

being so fucking jealous,

08:20.360 --> 08:22.527
'cause I beat them so fucking hard.

10:08.468 --> 10:10.624

God, I have to half-nelson
you like you're a dog?

- You half-nelson dogs? -
Don't make this about me.

11:37.048 --> 11:40.682
You are all-caps Abbi right now.
I need you to be case sensitive.

11:40.717 --> 11:42.305
- Everybody's weirded out.
- Okay.

11:42.340 --> 11:43.726
- I'm just gonna sit out.
- Yeah.

11:43.730 --> 11:45.029
- I'm just gonna sit out for the rest.
- Chillin'.

11:45.114 --> 11:47.633
- Okay. Thanks, dude, I really appreciate it.
- All right, just breathe deep.

11:47.668 --> 11:48.567
Okay.

11:48.602 --> 11:50.117
Okay, guys, we're all tied up.

11:50.236 --> 11:52.036
It comes down to the pugil-stick event.

11:52.121 --> 11:53.454
Stef verse Gemma.

11:53.573 --> 11:55.539
Fair fight. Come on.

11:55.625 --> 11:57.305
- No, no, Trey, hold up.
- No, no, no.

11:57.306 --> 11:58.485
Not today.

11:58.578 --> 11:59.623
Sorry, Stef.

11:59.662 --> 12:02.375
This is between me and you.

12:03.666 --> 12:07.001
Thanks so much... Not!

12:07.086 --> 12:11.248
I am gonna knock your big
swangin' titties into next Tuesday.

12:11.473 --> 12:13.374
Oh, my God, okay, wait, wait, wait.

12:13.493 --> 12:14.892
I want to do one, I want
to do one, okay, okay, okay.

12:14.978 --> 12:16.811
I'm gonna wipe the floor with you,

12:16.929 --> 12:20.481
but it looks like you
already did that, cleaner!

12:20.756 --> 12:24.268
No, I'm kidding, you
guys, I'm kidding, come on!

12:24.404 --> 12:25.853
I'm Kidding!

12:32.328 --> 12:33.479
Abbi, no!

12:35.068 --> 12:36.735
Thank God. Nothing's broken.

12:36.820 --> 12:39.154
All right, no need to
press charges, guys, okay?

12:39.239 --> 12:40.906
Finish this now.

12:40.991 --> 12:42.991
God, I thought I could handle it, dude.

12:43.076 --> 12:45.577
But I guess all-caps Abbi
is just still up in me.

12:47.164 --> 12:48.213
Oh! Gemma...

12:48.332 --> 12:49.664
Abbi.

12:49.750 --> 12:50.832
I am so sorry...

12:50.968 --> 12:53.501
- Great Soulstice games today.
- Thank you.

12:53.637 --> 12:56.004
You are stronger than you look.

12:56.139 --> 12:57.806
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

12:59.977 --> 13:02.143
Hey. Cool shirt.

13:02.229 --> 13:05.230
- Can I talk to you for a sec, Ab?
- Yeah, Trey, listen,

13:05.349 --> 13:07.232
- I can explain what just happened.
- No, no, no.

13:07.351 --> 13:10.185
I was gonna say, this
happens to every new trainer.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.573
You don't have to do
steroids to be cool.

13:12.608 --> 13:13.699
- You know?
- Okay.

13:13.734 --> 13:15.810
- I...
- Because you're already cool.

13:16.026 --> 13:18.026
Oh.

13:18.111 --> 13:20.195
But if you are gonna do
steroids, I would suggest

13:20.280 --> 13:22.197
starting with a half-dose of
anabolic the first couple weeks.

13:22.332 --> 13:24.749
It does make your balls
shrivel, but in your case,

13:24.868 --> 13:27.202
it's gonna make your boobs
rock hard, which is a bless.

13:27.337 --> 13:28.753
Just a tip.

13:28.772 --> 13:29.838
- Okay. All right.
- Love you, buddy.

13:29.923 --> 13:32.207
- Ilana.
- Hey.

13:32.342 --> 13:33.291
Too slow.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.043
Good to see you, though.

13:35.178 --> 13:37.596
That's funny, dude.
Like, even though I...

13:37.714 --> 13:40.215
I hate any form of
aggression, especially yours,

13:40.350 --> 13:42.250
all-caps Abbi fits in at Soulstice.

13:42.352 --> 13:44.135
We are very upwardly
mobile right now, gotta say,

13:44.221 --> 13:45.387
very Jay and Bey.

13:45.472 --> 13:47.722
Speaking of which, I haven't
tweeted in twelve twinutes.

13:47.808 --> 13:49.224
- What am I gonna tweet about?
- Interesting vocab.

13:49.309 --> 13:51.059
What should I tweet about?

13:51.144 --> 13:53.728
Oh, my God.

13:53.814 --> 13:56.064
Of course, a horse!

13:56.199 --> 13:59.701
This tweet will be
my Ms. 'Olland's Opus.

13:59.786 --> 14:01.236
I'm gonna sprint home right now.

14:01.371 --> 14:03.401
- To Queens?
- Yeah, you want to race me?

14:03.436 --> 14:04.709
I'm not going to Queens...

14:07.244 --> 14:08.743
Woof...

14:08.879 --> 14:10.161
Deals, Deals, Deals...

14:10.247 --> 14:12.592
I'm doing you right.

14:19.185 --> 14:21.247
_

14:23.610 --> 14:24.891
You okay?

14:25.896 --> 14:26.928
Let's go.

14:27.064 --> 14:29.097
I've never seen Todd so aggressive.

14:29.182 --> 14:30.265
Therapy.

14:33.487 --> 14:35.987
Ilana, you're fired.

14:36.106 --> 14:37.989
<i>What? I just got promoted.</i>

14:38.108 --> 14:42.027
You tweeted an extremely
graphic bestiality video.

14:42.112 --> 14:43.611
Todd, it's "Mr. Hands."

14:43.747 --> 14:45.747
It's a staple of early digital culture.

14:45.832 --> 14:48.667
- Talk about viral. Google it.
- I don't have to!

14:48.785 --> 14:51.119
You tweeted it from the
company Twitter account.

14:51.204 --> 14:52.454
It's a PR nightmare.

14:52.539 --> 14:55.957
You're welcome. Now
we have a PR nightmare.

14:56.043 --> 14:56.958
It's cool.

14:57.044 --> 14:58.793
It was a guy fucking a horse.

14:58.929 --> 15:01.179
Yeah, and it's a deal for colonics.

15:01.298 --> 15:02.263
It's brilliant!

15:02.349 --> 15:04.883
I was just doing my job really well.

15:04.968 --> 15:06.384
And if you did your homework, Todd,

15:06.470 --> 15:09.304
you would know that the
horse was fucking the guy.

15:09.439 --> 15:11.272
It's chill!

15:11.358 --> 15:13.725
I need you to get your
things and leave the office.

15:13.810 --> 15:16.783
- We can work this out.
- I have been covering for you for far too long.

15:16.837 --> 15:19.564
- I have put my blood, sweat...
- You make all the other employees uncomfortable.

15:19.649 --> 15:22.710
- And farts into this company.
- Uncomfortable does not begin to describe

15:22.711 --> 15:24.652
- how you make the others...
- I am heading the corporate morale department.

15:24.788 --> 15:26.645
- The amount of money you cost us in paper alone
- And thanks to me,

15:26.726 --> 15:28.656
- I'm hardly making any commission,
- makes it worth letting you go.

15:28.792 --> 15:31.326
- which saves the company money.
- Ilana, Ilana, Ilana.

15:31.461 --> 15:32.577
I need you to leave.

15:32.662 --> 15:33.628
I should stay.

15:33.714 --> 15:36.439
- I need you to leave.
- I should stay.

15:37.050 --> 15:40.135
I am strong, and you are fired.

15:40.270 --> 15:44.973
This is just the white man holding
on to the last nugget of his power.

15:45.058 --> 15:48.143
You white dudes are figuring
out that the jig is fucking up!

15:48.228 --> 15:50.195
I'm gonna go talk to Mom!

15:50.314 --> 15:53.148
Oh, you are absolutely
fired, effective immediately.

15:53.233 --> 15:54.900
You're right, it's time to change.

15:54.985 --> 15:57.152
And I figured it out.

15:57.237 --> 15:59.685
I want to be... in you.

16:01.041 --> 16:02.073
You need to leave.

16:02.159 --> 16:03.458
Yeah, I... ahem... Yep.

16:04.962 --> 16:06.545
This is it, guys.

16:06.663 --> 16:07.791
The last hurrah.

16:07.826 --> 16:09.297
I'm really gonna miss this place.

16:09.383 --> 16:11.775
I'm gonna miss each of
you. You're like family.

16:11.810 --> 16:13.802
I'm gonna miss you
white guy number seven.

16:13.887 --> 16:15.470
You make Jews look good.

16:15.556 --> 16:16.638
You're hot.

16:16.723 --> 16:18.139
Goodbye, white guy number three.

16:18.225 --> 16:20.091
Love the man bun. You started the trend.

16:20.177 --> 16:21.343
And goodbye, Adult Braces.

16:21.428 --> 16:23.345
I got those off seven months ago.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.263
Would you rather I go
back to "Only Black Guy"?

16:25.349 --> 16:27.349
Adult Braces is fine.

16:27.484 --> 16:28.516
And you.

16:28.602 --> 16:30.352
We are all proud of you, new girl.

16:30.487 --> 16:31.853
I hired you.

16:31.989 --> 16:33.488
Mmm.

16:33.574 --> 16:34.522
And you.

16:34.608 --> 16:36.575
Nicoletta, my princess.

16:36.693 --> 16:38.860
My diamond. My Princess Di!

16:38.946 --> 16:41.496
You are the reason I come
to work every other day.

16:41.582 --> 16:43.448
You're the hardest
one to say goodbye to.

16:43.533 --> 16:44.950
Don't cry, don't cry.

16:45.035 --> 16:46.368
Ow!

16:46.503 --> 16:49.120
Goodbyes are hard, but this
is not goodbye for you and me.

16:49.206 --> 16:51.339
We will be together again.

16:51.425 --> 16:52.874
I am gonna crack that nut.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.376
I think that's just about enough.

16:54.461 --> 16:55.927
One last thing.

16:59.049 --> 17:02.866
I'm leaving him here because I
really do believe in corporate morale.

18:50.561 --> 18:52.323
I need you to absorb Ilana's deal.

18:56.466 --> 18:58.312
Day 511...

18:59.669 --> 19:01.052
It ends.

19:02.672 --> 19:04.223
I'm free.

19:04.861 --> 19:07.478
You know what? I'm gonna
unfollow Deals, Deals, Deals.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.864
- Pssh, you should.
- Oh, my God.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.846
Look what they tweeted.

19:12.903 --> 19:15.370
"We sincerely apologize
for our last tweet.

19:15.488 --> 19:19.872
"It was posted by a former employee
who suffers from mental health issues."

19:19.907 --> 19:21.080
We all do.

19:21.115 --> 19:22.744
"We hope she's getting
the help she needs."

19:22.829 --> 19:24.295
- I'm with you, so I am.
- Okay.

19:24.381 --> 19:28.422
"We do not promote bestiality,
but we still promote colonics."

19:28.457 --> 19:32.196
The horse was fucking the guy.
It's honestly not that bad.

19:34.724 --> 19:37.141
It's not as bad as if...

19:37.227 --> 19:38.726
a human was fucking the animal.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.846
<i>That's all. That's all.</i>

19:41.982 --> 19:46.351
I... I think everyone agrees, on that.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.319
- Right?
- Awesome.

19:48.405 --> 19:49.654
But fuck them, dude.

19:49.739 --> 19:51.385
- You don't need them.
- That's what I say, I don't.

19:51.420 --> 19:54.286
That was the worst job in the
world, don't even worry about it.

19:54.321 --> 19:56.605
I know, fuck them.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.579
Let's just forget all our flaws,

19:58.698 --> 20:01.833
'cause today was a total fluke.

20:01.918 --> 20:06.103
Yeah, well, I wish I could forget, like,
my hunger for competition, but it's like...

20:07.641 --> 20:08.873
It's online, so, like, I can't...

20:09.009 --> 20:10.625
Red Rover's online?

20:10.710 --> 20:11.876
Ow, Ilana.

20:12.012 --> 20:13.795
Show me now!

20:16.766 --> 20:18.516
Whoa...

20:18.601 --> 20:20.218
<i>Woo!</i>

20:20.353 --> 20:24.169
<i>Red Rover, Red Rover,
send Abbi right over!</i>

20:24.204 --> 20:27.692
<i>Ahh!</i>

20:27.777 --> 20:30.695
<i>Let go! Come on, let me through!</i>

20:30.780 --> 20:33.731
<i>Oh, she's biting me!</i>

20:33.817 --> 20:35.733
<i>- Abbi, Abbi!
- Arms up!</i>

20:35.869 --> 20:38.236
<i>Breathe, breathe... Shh...</i>

20:38.371 --> 20:39.654
<i>- Jesus, Abbi.
- I'm fine.</i>

20:39.739 --> 20:40.738
<i>- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.</i>

20:40.824 --> 20:42.824
<i>I'm gonna let you go now.</i>

20:42.942 --> 20:46.193
<i>- She's going!
- She's heading for the woods! She's a climber!</i>

20:46.401 --> 20:47.713
<i>- Abbi.
- Abbi!</i>

20:47.714 --> 20:48.707
<i>Come on!</i>

20:48.708 --> 20:50.108
<i>Abbi, you're not in trouble, ok?</i>

20:50.109 --> 20:51.509
<i>- Abbi!
- Abbi!</i>

20:51.687 --> 20:53.131
<i>Where is she?</i>

20:54.036 --> 20:55.248
<i>Ah!</i>
