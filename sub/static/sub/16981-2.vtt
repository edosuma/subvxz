00:06.240 --> 00:07.920
We've got a problem. If you help us fix it,

00:07.920 --> 00:12.000
- it would go a long way to argue the case for keeping you here.
- What kind of problem?
- Jan Roth.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.280
Roth is the brains behind this website on the darknet.

00:15.280 --> 00:18.080
There were images of Callum,

00:18.080 --> 00:21.880
and an offer to spend time with him for a fee of 15,000.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.360
- I want to go home!
- You can't go home.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.720
I can get us out of it, Ned. Might even be able to save the boy.

00:28.720 --> 00:31.800
I just need to try and get Roth's attention.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.840
And, if he bites, we'll send him the keys

00:33.840 --> 00:36.000
with the Trojan going along for the ride.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.760
Which will give us a back door into his system and the chance

00:38.760 --> 00:41.640
to find the IP address of the man who's trying to buy Callum.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.720
Just in from intelligence - they got the guy responsible for the attack.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.520
- It's Marcus.
- This is bullshit.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.560
They killed him and they dumped his body back there

00:55.560 --> 00:57.080
so we could take the blame.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.080
Lara, we've got a problem.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.760
I'm more interested in you, Jesse.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.800
Your insights into a particular technical problem that I have.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.200
Hey, where are we going?

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:31.720 --> 02:34.480
- What time's your game tomorrow?
- You're doing the afternoon.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.360
Oi! Thank you very much.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.840
Are you trying to paint your face with your food or something?

03:22.360 --> 03:24.560
Help me! Help me!

03:26.120 --> 03:27.720
What are you doing? Help me!

03:30.680 --> 03:32.400
Help me!

03:37.120 --> 03:39.280
Jesse didn't exactly stick to the plan.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.120
Which is exactly what I said would happen, didn't I?

03:42.120 --> 03:46.040
So what happens to the idea of him getting us into Roth's computer?

03:46.040 --> 03:47.880
Well, it still might happen.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.960
As long as he's with Roth, there is still a chance.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.680
Do you really think?

03:51.680 --> 03:54.280
He's a nice boy, but he can't tie his shoelaces

03:54.280 --> 03:56.920
without a team of helpers and a ten point plan.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.200
I want to go public.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.560
Look, at this critical stage,

04:03.560 --> 04:05.360
we don't think that that's the way to go.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.960
You keep saying that, you don't say why!

04:09.080 --> 04:12.240
Detective Daniels isn't actually at liberty to say why.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.960
There are some quite significant security implications

04:14.960 --> 04:17.480
in the mix - national security implications -

04:17.480 --> 04:19.200
that he hasn't been briefed on.

04:21.360 --> 04:25.400
I can't even begin to imagine the horror you're going through,

04:25.400 --> 04:29.160
but I need to tell you that we are dealing with a very smart

04:29.160 --> 04:31.920
and dangerous man, and, if we tip our hand early,

04:31.920 --> 04:35.200
let Roth know we're looking for him, he'll be gone.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.440
We'll find Callum, with or without Jesse's help.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.720
I need you to be strong - let us do our job.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.400
Can you give us a second? Lara?

04:51.560 --> 04:53.920
"We will find Callum"? You can't do that.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.280
Really?

04:56.280 --> 04:59.240
I know without a shadow of a doubt that, if we go to the media now,

04:59.240 --> 05:02.480
the chances of finding Roth go through the floor.

05:02.480 --> 05:05.680
So I make a promise I might not be able to keep to improve the odds

05:05.680 --> 05:09.360
of actually finding that boy alive. I can live with that.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.560
What national security implications?

05:12.800 --> 05:14.720
You know the drill, Nolan.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.200
If you were meant to know, I'd have told you.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.360
Wait here.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.080
ROTH WHISTLES

06:07.640 --> 06:09.160
Seasick or panic?

06:09.160 --> 06:12.280
I don't know, they feel kind of the same.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.840
This is bad, Hani.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.320
Unless you want to get all literal for a minute, in which case,

06:17.320 --> 06:19.520
nothing actually bad has happened yet.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.640
We're in the middle of God knows where in the company of a man

06:22.640 --> 06:25.720
who thinks selling small boys on the internet is OK,

06:25.720 --> 06:28.600
and whose last travel companions finished up being shot to death

06:28.600 --> 06:31.600
on a road that looked horribly just like this one.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.280
That doesn't seem actually bad to you?

06:36.520 --> 06:39.160
And there's the fact that we no longer have a plan.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.960
Which is why we move on to Plan B.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.560
Come on, kids, let's go.

06:48.680 --> 06:51.560
We go to his place, you solve his technical problem,

06:51.560 --> 06:54.120
and, while you're at it, we find a way to copy his entire hard drive.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.360
Instead of them getting into his system with the Trojan,

06:56.360 --> 06:58.360
we just give them a copy of the lot?

06:58.360 --> 06:59.920
You can do this, Jesse.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.720
You can still save Callum.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.720
In you get. On the floor.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.960
- Why?
- Not that I think you would turn me in intentionally,

07:06.960 --> 07:10.200
but, once you're back in the loving arms of the intelligence community,

07:10.200 --> 07:11.480
shit happens.

07:12.840 --> 07:16.080
I just want to clarify our arrangement.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.120
I take a look at your problem, you pay the 25,000,

07:19.120 --> 07:21.280
and then you're taking us back, right?

07:21.280 --> 07:22.640
- Mm.
- That's what's happening?

07:22.640 --> 07:24.640
Well, as much as I enjoy your charming company,

07:24.640 --> 07:28.080
I'm not looking for a long-term relationship.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.680
In you go.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.880
Down there.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.320
Who the hell are they?

08:58.320 --> 09:01.160
- You're overreacting.
- You don't know the first thing about them.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.800
Oh, sorry, except that they are working with the police department

09:03.800 --> 09:07.400
- to try and catch you.
- They were bait, Kiki, nothing more.

09:07.400 --> 09:10.280
I took them out right from under the cops' noses.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.920
They're going to help me get the job done,

09:11.920 --> 09:14.480
- and then I'm going to bring them back.
- Oh, and, five minutes later,

09:14.480 --> 09:17.200
the troops arrive, and then you're locked up for the rest of your life.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.000
Yeah, it's a risk. But Jesse is worth the risk.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.240
He's smarter than Eric and Christo put together.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.720
Which one of you is Jesse?

09:24.160 --> 09:26.360
Kind of a girl's name, isn't it?

09:27.960 --> 09:32.760
- Jesse James was a boy.
- Who's that?
- He was an outlaw.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.160
Are you an outlaw too?

09:36.520 --> 09:37.880
- Um...
- No.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.640
He's a good guy.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.480
I don't want to argue about this any more. We're so close, OK?

09:45.480 --> 09:49.480
It's my work. I need to get it back, and I can't do it alone.

09:54.960 --> 09:59.200
Jesse, Hani, my wife Kiki,

09:59.200 --> 10:03.200
who is sometimes, but not always, a little more hospitable.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.400
- Hello.
- Hi.

10:09.240 --> 10:12.680
Excellent. Now that that's out of the way, let's get to work.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.400
Right.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.960
We haven't been able to crack it.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.240
Open it.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.880
First impressions?

11:23.880 --> 11:27.280
First impression is that, even if I can decrypt the file,

11:27.280 --> 11:29.960
you don't have the authorisation to launch the programme.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.880
Indeed. You can see where my problem is.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.000
He opens it, what sort of trouble is he getting himself into?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.200
Because the strength of that encryption suggests that

11:39.200 --> 11:41.880
whoever you stole it from is pretty invested in keeping it unopened.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.760
I think "stole" is the wrong word.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.280
Really? Because the fact that you don't have the decryption key

11:46.280 --> 11:48.240
is a pretty big clue that it doesn't belong to you.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.840
I don't think these insights from the peanut gallery are helping,

11:50.840 --> 11:52.400
so why don't you take a fucking walk?

11:52.400 --> 11:54.960
You don't get to talk to her like that.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.120
I also work better without an audience.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.680
The sooner you get this job done,

12:17.680 --> 12:21.840
the sooner you two get to go back to your little lives together.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.520
So unless you've got something positive to say...

12:29.000 --> 12:32.080
MACHINES BEEP

12:38.080 --> 12:39.880
I'll be right back.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.480
I've just been with Marcus' kids.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.720
How are they doing?

13:04.960 --> 13:07.520
- KIKI SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE
- It's nothing.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.920
'Give me your phone, Remsey.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.000
'More threatening texts today.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.520
'"Tell your wife to get your coffin ready, then she's next."

13:21.520 --> 13:23.720
And you still don't want to fight back?

13:24.760 --> 13:28.480
Scare tactics, which only work if they scare me.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.040
Well, you should be.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.120
You can't lead the movement from the grave.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.280
You get started on that,

13:40.280 --> 13:43.440
I'm going to go and find something we can copy his hard drive onto.

14:21.480 --> 14:24.320
TV BLARES IN NEXT ROOM

14:24.320 --> 14:26.480
Hey, Rambo, can you turn it down?

14:28.760 --> 14:32.840
I think that's the medieval one, not the modern war.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.760
- Right!
- Dad!

14:59.760 --> 15:02.920
A violent and chilling end for two young Australian surfers

15:02.920 --> 15:05.640
caught in the crossfire, as tensions boil over

15:05.640 --> 15:08.680
in the troubled Indonesian province of West Papua.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.560
While the names of the young men have not been released,

15:11.560 --> 15:14.920
new details are beginning to emerge which suggest the attack

15:14.920 --> 15:17.960
could be linked to the pro-independence movement.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.520
The attack is the latest in a series of incidents

15:20.520 --> 15:24.120
on the road outside the Australian-owned Helmston Mine.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.960
The mine has become a flashpoint in one of the region's most violent

15:27.960 --> 15:30.080
and least talked about conflicts.

15:30.080 --> 15:33.040
Fiona Walsh is on the line from the capital.

15:33.040 --> 15:36.400
Fiona, what can you tell us about today's developments?

15:36.400 --> 15:38.160
Paul, what I can tell you is that

15:38.160 --> 15:41.120
the local police are taking things very seriously.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.080
Interview tomorrow, right?

15:43.080 --> 15:45.320
'A dedicated task force is on its way to the province...

15:45.320 --> 15:46.800
You're not eating?

15:46.800 --> 15:50.040
Oh, there's a security meeting I just can't get out of.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.960
- Thought we'd hang out a bit later?
- I'm not hungry.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.960
SHE SIGHS

15:59.840 --> 16:03.640
Marcus Kombian. Local law enforcement confirms he was shot

16:03.640 --> 16:07.200
- and killed during the attack.
- The Australians fired back?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.200
Handgun was recovered from the vehicle.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.360
We're waiting on ballistic reports.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.160
- Do we know how many were involved?
- Locals say three or four.

16:14.160 --> 16:17.000
But everything points to Kombian being the leader.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.320
He was a loud voice against the mine, and was a close associate

16:20.320 --> 16:24.400
of one of the current leaders of the separatist movement, Remsey Gangi.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.720
Remsey Gangi was there at the attack?

16:26.720 --> 16:29.800
Unconfirmed. We need those lease negotiations finalised -

16:29.800 --> 16:31.880
any sense of when that might be?

16:31.880 --> 16:35.360
You'll have new draft amendments on your table by the end of the day.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.840
It's scheduled for a public signing

16:36.840 --> 16:39.600
as a centrepiece to the forum next Monday.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.680
Sooner would take the heat out of the situation.

16:42.680 --> 16:46.320
I'm sure it would, Neil. But they want to double the size of the mine.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.120
There's a quid pro quo.

16:48.120 --> 16:51.000
Terms of trade concessions, a revamp of the aid budget.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.080
Look, expanding the mine's in everyone's interest,

16:53.080 --> 16:55.600
but I'd prefer it if we're not left carrying the financial can

16:55.600 --> 16:57.080
for the next decade or more.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.160
Any good news on Roth?

16:58.160 --> 17:01.000
No, he's keeping his head well and truly down.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
I'm assuming you read last night's briefing?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.079
I read it. And I've got a bunch of questions.

17:07.079 --> 17:10.319
And most of them start with, "who the fuck was the genius in charge of

17:10.319 --> 17:13.359
"handing Jesse Banks over to Roth on a silver platter?"

17:15.800 --> 17:18.960
Simpleton, really? That was completely uncalled for.

17:20.599 --> 17:24.160
Hello, the Honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.560
God, it sounds completely ridiculous, doesn't it?

17:26.560 --> 17:27.680
Fits you like a glove.

17:27.680 --> 17:31.160
Hey, can you walk with me? I've got a presser.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.640
I mean it, though. So deserved.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.080
It's a big step up.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.200
- How's Alyse?
- She's good.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.440
- All things considered.
- She still in pain?

17:40.440 --> 17:44.000
Mm-hm. Think there's always going to be a lot of pain, you know?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.560
On good days, she's full of yoga and meditation, bad days,

17:46.560 --> 17:48.520
more prescription meds than I'd like.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.080
She's applied for this design degree, though.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.400
I think this is going to really turn things around for her,

17:53.400 --> 17:55.720
give her something positive to focus on.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.920
Nothing like hitting the ground running, eh?

17:58.920 --> 18:01.240
Yeah, this is a shit fight we could all do without.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.280
But it will get sorted,

18:03.280 --> 18:07.480
provided we all stay calm and hold off hitting the panic button.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.960
It would be good to keep the message as contained as possible,

18:09.960 --> 18:13.400
though, just keep Roth's past in the vault for now.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.000
Watch out, Will, she's gunning for your job.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.680
I did my time, just asking for a little tweak on message,

18:18.680 --> 18:20.720
make my life easier, that's all.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.640
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

18:28.720 --> 18:33.160
As I said, we've had investigative teams from Australia and West Papua

18:33.160 --> 18:34.720
investigating this event.

18:34.720 --> 18:38.000
We're in the process of repatriating the bodies of the young men.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.080
PHONE VIBRATES Obviously our thoughts and prayers

18:42.080 --> 18:45.600
go out to their families at this very difficult time.

18:45.600 --> 18:50.080
What I can also tell you is that the bilateral investigative team have

18:50.080 --> 18:53.840
found the body of a man we believe to be responsible for the attack.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.240
Hey.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.400
Just got off the phone from Paul.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.160
Thinks you're holding out for more money.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.680
If you don't come round soon, he's going to offer the job to Mark.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.640
He should do that. Mark's perfect for it.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.760
He's capable, but everyone knows you're five times the runner.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.640
The two Australians killed in West Papua -

19:32.640 --> 19:34.920
why aren't their names being released?

19:34.920 --> 19:36.360
The only reason to withhold names

19:36.360 --> 19:38.720
is if the families haven't been informed.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.320
They're repatriating the bodies - the families obviously know.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.760
Tell me what's going on, and I'll see what I can find out.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.600
- I can't talk about it.
- Can't or won't?

19:46.600 --> 19:48.880
- Shit, Erin, does it matter?
- Matters to me.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.920
Can't, OK?

19:54.480 --> 19:58.920
Joey. Yeah, hey, need a favour. Erm...

19:58.920 --> 20:01.240
The names of the two Australians killed in the attack

20:01.240 --> 20:02.960
on the mine road in West Papua.

20:06.360 --> 20:09.040
OK. Yeah, talk later.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.400
- I'll put it on your bill.
- Yeah.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.000
Come over later, five-ish?

20:21.000 --> 20:24.640
Yeah. Oh, I can't, I've got the reading of the will.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.320
Whose will?

20:27.320 --> 20:28.640
My mum's.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.720
Your mum died?

20:33.200 --> 20:35.600
- When?
- Last week.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.080
It was a heart attack.

20:42.440 --> 20:45.640
Hey, is there something I can do?

20:45.640 --> 20:47.280
When's the funeral?

20:48.480 --> 20:49.960
It was Saturday.

20:58.560 --> 21:01.440
- I can call you when I'm done.
- Yeah, sure, whatever.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.720
What the fuck are you doing, mate?

22:46.960 --> 22:50.400
Can you tell Geoff I'm not going to make the blast shoot this afternoon?

22:50.400 --> 22:53.920
I feel sick. I'm going to go back to the hotel and crash.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.400
Yeah, no worries.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.680
PHONE RINGING

23:04.960 --> 23:06.840
- Hello?
- Yeah, sorry.

23:06.840 --> 23:09.040
My earlier messages might not have made any sense.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.920
- You're a journalist, right?
- Yes, but this isn't for a story.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.400
I'm actually looking for my brother. I think he's with someone

23:14.400 --> 23:16.880
who was involved in the attack on the mine road.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.120
Yeah? Who do you think that is?

23:19.120 --> 23:20.960
The guy's name's Roth.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.480
Jan Roth. Do you know him?

23:23.520 --> 23:26.280
Maybe, but I don't know you from Adam.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.400
Listen, if I could hassle somebody else, I would,

23:29.400 --> 23:30.840
but you're the only name I've got.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.800
And I'm sorry if this inconveniences you in your duties

23:33.800 --> 23:37.440
singing the praises of the mining lobby, but I'm desperate, OK?

23:38.880 --> 23:42.480
Do you have any idea what it takes to get permission to be here?

23:42.480 --> 23:45.960
I needed to pitch a story that could offend nobody.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.800
And then I had to get signatures from 18 departments.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.280
- 18.
- I'm not... I'm really not...

23:50.280 --> 23:52.480
Then I had to submit a list of people I'm going to talk to,

23:52.480 --> 23:53.880
and pictures I'm going to take,

23:53.880 --> 23:58.040
and these all need to be confirmed on company letterhead.

23:58.040 --> 24:01.120
- All... All...
- I am here singing the praises of the mine.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.720
Lots of people are watching, making sure that I'm doing that.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.520
My job is to make sure that they don't see what else I'm doing,

24:06.520 --> 24:10.040
and, if you fuck that up, I will be very unhappy.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.880
Don't know who your brother is, mate, or where he is, OK?

24:13.880 --> 24:16.440
- I... I...
- Don't contact me at the mine again,

24:16.440 --> 24:18.080
and don't use my maiden name.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.640
- Help me!
- Where are you?

25:00.640 --> 25:03.480
I'm in a flat. It's locked.

25:03.480 --> 25:07.320
No can do, man. I'm already back at base. I'm on the eastern flank,

25:07.320 --> 25:09.440
and there's a line of tanks coming my way.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.320
I'm serious!

25:11.320 --> 25:12.720
I'm being serious!

25:24.960 --> 25:27.000
No!

25:29.200 --> 25:30.720
No!

25:36.960 --> 25:39.040
Ah, fuck you!

25:42.000 --> 25:44.080
- Hey...
- Get off me!

25:44.080 --> 25:46.480
Sorry.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.600
I'M sorry. I'M sorry.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.840
I'm sorry we're here. I'm sorry I said I could do this.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.520
I'm sorry that Callum's...

25:57.880 --> 26:00.280
Are you done?

26:00.280 --> 26:02.360
Tanty over, or is there more?

26:06.800 --> 26:09.280
I'm most sorry that I dragged you into this.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.680
Can you please take your jacket off?

26:12.680 --> 26:14.880
It's making me hot just looking at you.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.760
- I don't smell very good.
- Me too.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.920
Lucky we like each other so much.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.840
BEEPING

26:42.000 --> 26:43.360
Power surge.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.240
Yeah, that UPS is not going to hold up for long.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.040
I'm going to get some supplies.

26:54.960 --> 26:58.120
Right, I'm just going to grab the generator out of here.

27:01.160 --> 27:04.320
There's a couple of motherboards in there. You should grab them,

27:04.320 --> 27:07.120
- just in case the surge burnt them out back at home.
- Mm.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.120
Hey! Ken!

27:12.320 --> 27:15.000
Hey, Meg.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.160
OK, but it'll take us 20 to get there.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.280
Budi said he can get us into the morgue to see Marcus' body.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.600
- When?
- Now. I said we'd be there in 20 minutes.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.480
- I'd better get these two home first.
- Mm. No time.

27:37.480 --> 27:41.320
The window's one hour, then the body's trucked back to the capital.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.680
- You took your time.
- Roadblock.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.640
Had to take the long way around.

27:58.640 --> 28:02.080
- Can we still go in?
- It's going to be tight.

28:02.080 --> 28:06.760
- You are?
- Ah, these are my friends, Jesse and Hani.

28:06.760 --> 28:10.000
- Friends is not accurate.
- Oh, that hurts.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
Friends don't kidnap one another and transport them to other countries

28:13.000 --> 28:16.320
- without permission.
- You're Ned's brother.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.040
He's been hassling me like mental, worried about you.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.720
Can you let him know you're alive? Then he might get off my case.

28:21.720 --> 28:25.440
Well, I have no way of doing that, thanks to my "friend" in the front.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.200
Right, we're on.

28:32.360 --> 28:35.320
You're not going to do anything silly, are you?

28:35.320 --> 28:37.040
Not on purpose.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.080
The bullet hole.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.520
He said to photograph the wound.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.160
The burn mark around it, see?

29:08.240 --> 29:10.280
And the traces of gunpowder.

29:11.320 --> 29:14.080
The doctor said this is a man killed at point-blank range.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.280
Not from a distance.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.640
- But what does this prove?
- Proves his story is horse shit.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.800
He said that Christo shot him from the car,

29:21.800 --> 29:23.560
but they found him 20 metres away.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.680
It gets worse.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.240
These marks.

29:30.080 --> 29:32.720
And at his ankles too.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.800
Bruising and rope burn.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.760
He'd been tied up. There was a struggle.

29:37.760 --> 29:41.240
- CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS
- And around his throat...

29:41.240 --> 29:42.840
See there?

29:42.840 --> 29:44.000
Fingernail marks.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.520
And there, haemorrhaging.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.640
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS

29:54.920 --> 29:56.280
If we get the power back up,

29:56.280 --> 29:58.920
how long will it take you to copy the under counter files?

29:58.920 --> 30:02.480
Including the entire cache and logs, one, one and a half hours.

30:06.080 --> 30:09.240
And then it's a question of how to get them to the police.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.560
We wait till they've cancelled the extradition orders, and THEN

30:13.560 --> 30:16.320
we hand them over, otherwise they're still calling the shots.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.640
But the longer we take, the more chance that Callum...

30:18.640 --> 30:20.160
You can't think like that.

30:21.160 --> 30:24.040
We've just got to put one foot in front of the other.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.520
GUNSHOTS

30:42.920 --> 30:44.640
Come on, get him up! Get him up!

30:46.280 --> 30:49.360
Let's go, move, move, move! Come on!

30:49.360 --> 30:51.280
Get in, get in, get in.

30:54.040 --> 30:56.080
Ah, fuck!

30:56.080 --> 30:57.680
Go, go, go!

31:59.160 --> 32:00.880
- Run!
- Come on!

32:00.880 --> 32:02.960
- Run!
- Go, go, go, go, go, move it.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.400

32:17.640 --> 32:20.280
Come on, Jesse. Jesse, please.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.240
- Fuck.
- Please!

32:22.240 --> 32:24.720
Come on. We've got to get out of here.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.720
- I got him, I got him, I got him.
- Move!

33:31.840 --> 33:33.800
Does this qualify us as friends?

33:38.120 --> 33:41.160
Take it easy. It's all right, it's all right.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.880
Take it easy. It's OK.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.960
It's OK.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.240
Breathe.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.680
Just breathe. Breathe.

33:53.440 --> 33:56.520
- You should see a doctor.
- I don't need all this fuss, OK?

33:56.520 --> 33:59.080
- It's not serious.
- But it could have been.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.800
She's right. These are not empty threats, Remsey.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.120
- You should leave.
- No.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.720
Do you want your children to grow up without their father too?

34:06.720 --> 34:09.080
Let's get to Cairns, and we can decide what to do from there.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.920
No. I'm not sneaking in like a criminal.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.920
I have applied for the visa to go to the forum.

34:14.920 --> 34:19.760
- That's when I go.
- Now Marcus, two weeks ago Rika, and before that Pok.

34:19.760 --> 34:22.360
On and on it goes, too long, Remsey.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.239
And I let this madman here do it his way.

34:25.239 --> 34:27.199
We only want simple things.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.239
A cut of the mine, not the whole pie.

34:29.239 --> 34:30.920
For Christ's say, we want the same thing!

34:30.920 --> 34:33.560
- Please, not this again. Not now.
- A referendum before it is too late.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.400
Fight fire with fire, Remsey. That's how you get attention.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.440
But you're warmongering. We need to give the leadership a new chance.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.239
Smoke and mirrors. Why do you listen to the same bullshit? Over and o...

34:42.239 --> 34:45.199
- Enough, both of you.
- All right!

34:45.199 --> 34:47.320
All right, we will go.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.840
Good. I'll take you to Cairns tonight.

34:52.679 --> 34:53.840
Today was bad.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.920
- Today almost got us...
- But it didn't.

34:59.880 --> 35:00.960

35:34.280 --> 35:37.960
It must be tough being stuck between the two of them.

35:37.960 --> 35:41.280
If I could melt them into one person, one with too much fire,

35:41.280 --> 35:43.160
one without enough...

Do you know what is happening here?

Do people know? Do your friends know?

36:09.080 --> 36:11.640
You were a very cute baby.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.280
It's not me.

36:20.120 --> 36:22.200
There are another two near the door.

36:48.240 --> 36:52.040
Ned, for Christ's sake, just calm down, will you?

36:52.040 --> 36:55.400
- I can't even...
- I didn't know your mother would...

36:55.400 --> 36:58.960
I mean, why would she leave me the whole shebang?

36:58.960 --> 37:01.800
No, I'm... I just thought maybe I'd get back some of the money

37:01.800 --> 37:05.280
I invested in the house originally, that's all.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.800

37:12.160 --> 37:13.680
We were together 15 years.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.880
Pretty bloody big innings, in my book.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.600
Ah!

Oh, fuck!

- Sorry.
- No, no.

- Just up there.
- I was crap at everything.

37:45.840 --> 37:47.280
Crap father.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.800
I know I was a crap father. I was a crap husband too.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.960
Bloody crap everything. It's all right.

37:52.960 --> 37:59.000
I know. And don't think for a minute that I didn't regret walking out.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.040
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.000
- It doesn't...
- Just hear me out, Ned, just for once.

38:07.800 --> 38:10.360
I mean, I just didn't know what to do.

38:10.360 --> 38:13.040
You know, from the moment he was born, Jesse...

38:14.480 --> 38:16.720
..was difficult.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.440
He never slept, he cried all the time.

38:21.880 --> 38:23.320
And your mum...

38:24.440 --> 38:27.760
Well, your mum was diagnosed with postnatal depression,

38:27.760 --> 38:30.920
and it just went on and on,

38:30.920 --> 38:33.600
and I just thought it was never going to stop, never end.

38:33.600 --> 38:36.480
Marriage and family life didn't meet your expectations.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.480
Just chuck it in, someone will pick up the slack.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.000
- No. It actually wasn't like that.
- No?

38:40.000 --> 38:41.920
- That's what it looked like when I was 14.
- No...

38:41.920 --> 38:43.960
And it still pretty much looks like that now.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.560
You know, it was a good call.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.200
Because Mum's depression never did go away,

38:49.200 --> 38:51.280
and Jesse was a difficult child,

38:51.280 --> 38:54.720
who became a difficult teenager, and a pain in the arse adult.

38:55.880 --> 38:58.240
Did I ever think about abandoning ship?

38:58.240 --> 38:59.800
What do you reckon?

39:04.120 --> 39:05.560
I've got to go, Dad.

39:06.880 --> 39:09.240
I didn't come back for the money, Ned.

39:09.240 --> 39:11.880
I came back to try and build some bridges with you and Jesse.

39:11.880 --> 39:16.120
Yeah? I'm all out of bridge-building stuff right now.

39:24.880 --> 39:26.560

DOOR RATTLES

41:49.040 --> 41:50.200
It's just me.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.680
How are you going?

41:55.680 --> 41:57.280
It's nearly there.

42:25.520 --> 42:27.200
Well done, you.

42:35.280 --> 42:37.160
Something's not right.

42:39.080 --> 42:42.400
I couldn't open the folders, the ones about Callum.

42:43.920 --> 42:46.680
Did...? Did you need to?

42:47.880 --> 42:49.320
Not... Not really, but the point is

42:49.320 --> 42:51.640
I couldn't open them from Roth's system.

42:53.720 --> 42:57.680
Why would he protect his site in a way that he couldn't access himself?

43:00.080 --> 43:02.400
He didn't set it up, Hani.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.320
Someone else did,

43:04.320 --> 43:08.840
so that Roth wouldn't see them, so that he wouldn't know they're there.

43:08.840 --> 43:10.200
Who?

43:13.600 --> 43:18.280
Most of the money from the main site goes to an account in Germany.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.280
But the funds from the paedophilia stuff...

43:23.800 --> 43:25.200
Somewhere else?

43:26.200 --> 43:28.400
They go to an account in Belize.

43:28.400 --> 43:31.080
This account only has a single signatory.

43:33.240 --> 43:34.760
It's not Jan.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.520
What if he's not who they say he is?

43:40.920 --> 43:42.840
What do they say I am?

43:46.840 --> 43:48.560
What do they say?

43:53.320 --> 43:55.240
Someone needs to start talking.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.320
There's a boy.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.640
He went missing a few days ago.

44:08.960 --> 44:11.320
He's for sale on your site.

44:11.320 --> 44:13.360
On my site?

44:13.360 --> 44:15.120
In a private forum.

44:17.400 --> 44:19.040
Show me.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.880
So this is why you're here, so you could poke around in my closet

44:43.880 --> 44:47.640
- and see if I had any little boys stashed away.
- They want to...

44:47.640 --> 44:51.120
I was supposed to get them access to your hard drive

44:51.120 --> 44:54.360
so they could try and find Callum...

44:55.720 --> 44:58.960
..Callum, before the...

45:00.040 --> 45:02.080
..transaction is complete.

45:28.480 --> 45:29.960
Pack up.

45:42.200 --> 45:43.480
Hey, Dad.

46:10.440 --> 46:14.240
On Friday night, our 14-year-old boy went missing.

46:14.240 --> 46:18.080
He was supposed to be staying at a mate's place but he didn't show up.

46:19.520 --> 46:21.680
The police have tried to stop us from going public,

46:21.680 --> 46:24.560
but we can't wait any longer. We...

46:24.560 --> 46:27.560
We need anyone who might have seen him, or anything,

46:27.560 --> 46:31.840
even if they think it's not important, to come forward.

46:31.840 --> 46:37.040
Please, if anyone has seen anything, or knows anything,

46:37.040 --> 46:38.840
please contact the police.

46:44.880 --> 46:46.600
KNOCK AT DOOR

46:53.920 --> 46:56.520
Oh, no, you should definitely not come in.

46:56.520 --> 46:58.640
Assuming that I wanted to.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.080
I've had a hideous day.

47:00.080 --> 47:02.800
Jesse's still God knows where, and I've drunk too much.

47:02.800 --> 47:05.280
And I punched my father in the face.

47:05.280 --> 47:07.960
And I've drunk too much. I already said that.

47:07.960 --> 47:09.640
- Twice.
- Yeah.

47:09.640 --> 47:12.480
So, save yourself.

47:12.480 --> 47:16.120
- Don't come in.
- Maybe you just need to let off some steam.

48:38.640 --> 48:41.640
Away we go. MOTOR STARTS

49:32.600 --> 49:33.760
Jesse.

49:35.320 --> 49:36.360
Come.

49:58.280 --> 50:00.160
I want you to show me how he did it.

50:09.400 --> 50:12.160
It was there, if you were looking hard enough.

50:23.440 --> 50:24.720
You're right.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.240
It's my fault.

50:28.880 --> 50:30.960
I set the serpent free in the garden.

50:32.720 --> 50:34.800
What are you going to do?

50:34.800 --> 50:36.560
What am I going to do?

50:38.720 --> 50:40.520
I'm going to make things right.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.640
Yeah, Gary.

50:48.640 --> 50:50.800
Yeah, I'm coming into Cairns.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.880
There's a few things I need to tie up.

50:55.240 --> 50:57.560
No, no, I'll let you know when I get there.

50:58.560 --> 51:01.320
Buy yourself a ticket. I'll pay for it.

51:02.800 --> 51:04.040
OK.

51:11.600 --> 51:14.920
Let's find the kid, and we'll figure out what to do next.

51:18.560 --> 51:20.280
SIREN WAILS

51:20.280 --> 51:22.400
This is Australian Border Security.

51:24.920 --> 51:27.240
You are currently in Australian waters.

51:32.320 --> 51:34.120
Let's go find this kid.

51:34.120 --> 51:37.640
Cut your engines. We are coming along your starboard side.

51:43.320 --> 51:45.800
We seek permission to board your vessel.

51:45.800 --> 51:47.120
Come on.

51:59.120 --> 52:00.560
Jesse!

52:01.840 --> 52:02.920
Come on!
