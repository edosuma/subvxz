08:20.166 --> 08:21.417
- I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME,
WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS?

08:21.417 --> 08:22.417
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME
TO DO HERE?

08:22.417 --> 08:23.667
- HOW ABOUT CALEIGH?

08:23.667 --> 08:24.959
- WHO'S CALEIGH?
- CALEIGH, THE NEW INTERN.

08:24.959 --> 08:26.250
- SHE COULDN'T EVEN

08:26.250 --> 08:27.417
GET OUR COFFEE ORDERS RIGHT
THIS MORNING.

08:27.417 --> 08:28.625
HOW SHE IN ANY WAY QUALIFIED
FOR THIS?

08:28.625 --> 08:31.542
- SHE'S CUTE.
KPPQ AND KQMI DOES THE WHOLE

08:31.542 --> 08:32.708
CUTE WEATHER GIRL THING
ALL THE TIME,

08:32.708 --> 08:34.082
AND IT WORKS OUT FINE FOR THEM.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.291
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
WE'RE NOT GOING DOWN THAT ROAD.

08:35.291 --> 08:36.792
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.

08:36.792 --> 08:37.917
- JUST HAVE HER READ FLETCHER'S
LINES OFF THE TELEPROMPTER.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.166
- NO, FLETCH WRITES
HIS OWN COPY.

08:39.166 --> 08:40.500
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TEMPLATES
FOR THAT STUFF.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.417
- WELL, THAT WAS SMART.

08:42.417 --> 08:45.458
- THE RADIO SHOW.
[dialing phone]

08:45.458 --> 08:47.125
- HEY, CINDY,
CAN YOU CONNECT ME

08:47.125 --> 08:49.125
TO PACIFICA UNIVERSITY
WEATHER CENTER?

08:49.125 --> 08:51.041
IT WAS METCALFE SOMETHING.

08:51.041 --> 08:55.291
UM, DANA, DONNA, DEBBY,

08:55.291 --> 08:56.750
DEBBY, DEBBY, DEB METCALFE.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.291

WHERE YOU'RE GOING, SO...

08:59.291 --> 09:02.375
[phone ringing]

09:08.458 --> 09:09.792
- DEB METCALFE.

09:09.792 --> 09:11.125
- HI, DEB,
THIS IS QUENTIN STERLING,

09:11.125 --> 09:12.667
KFZA TV NEWS.

09:12.667 --> 09:13.959
- OH, HI.

09:13.959 --> 09:16.625
- WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO GO ON
THE AIR RIGHT AWAY

09:16.625 --> 09:18.291
TO DELIVER THE WEATHER
OVER THE PHONE?

09:18.291 --> 09:19.542
- OH, RIGHT NOW?

09:19.542 --> 09:20.917
- I KNOW, I'M IN QUITE
A JAM HERE, DEB.

09:20.917 --> 09:23.083
YOU'D BE DOING ME A HUGE FAVOR.
YOU CANNOT SAY NO.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.625
OUR VIEWERSHIP NEEDS
TO HEAR THE WEATHER REPORT,

09:24.625 --> 09:25.709
AND I CANNOT GIVE IT TO THEM.

09:25.709 --> 09:26.917
- I AM IN NO WAY QUALIFIED
TO DO THAT.

09:26.917 --> 09:30.208
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

09:30.208 --> 09:32.625
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU.

09:32.625 --> 09:36.750
SORRY, STAY RIGHT THERE.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.792
OKAY, I NEED YOU TO WRITE ME
AN INTRO.

09:38.792 --> 09:40.250
FLETCH HAD AN EMERGENCY.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.750
DEB METCALFE ON THE LINE,
PACIFICA UNIVERSITY STATION,

09:42.750 --> 09:44.333
METEOROLOGIST.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.125
GRANT, I HAVE DEB METCALFE
ON THE LINE.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.208
I'M GONNA PUT THIS INTRO
ON THE TELEPROMPTER,

09:47.208 --> 09:48.250
I'LL BE IN YOUR EAR.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.750
DO WE STILL HAVE DEB
ON THE LINE?

09:49.750 --> 09:51.166
OKAY, DEB,
CAN YOU HEAR ME STILL?

09:51.166 --> 09:52.667
OKAY, HERE WE ARE LIVE
IN THREE, TWO...

09:52.667 --> 09:55.333
- WELCOME BACK.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.750
FLETCH DOUGLAS HAD A SUDDEN
EMERGENCY TO ATTEND TO,

09:57.750 --> 09:59.333
BUT WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE

09:59.333 --> 10:01.750
TO HAVE ON THE LINE
FROM PACIFICA UNIVERSITY,

10:01.750 --> 10:03.333
METEOROLOGIST, DEB METCALFE.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.375
ARE YOU THERE, DEB?

10:04.375 --> 10:05.750
- I AM.
HI, GRANT.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.166
- WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT THIS STORM?

10:07.166 --> 10:09.417
- SO, DEB, WHAT CAN YOU
TELL US ABOUT THIS STORM?

10:09.417 --> 10:12.542
- WELL, CAN YOU
MAKE THE MAP WIDER

10:12.542 --> 10:14.041
TO INCLUDE
THE NORTHERN PACIFIC?

10:14.041 --> 10:17.875
- GIVE ME THE PACIFIC
ON THE MAP.

10:17.875 --> 10:20.041
- UH, THIS STORM SYSTEM
IS ACTUALLY PART

10:20.041 --> 10:21.458
OF AN ATMOSPHERIC RIVER,

10:21.458 --> 10:23.417
A CONCENTRATED BAND
OF MOISTURE

10:23.417 --> 10:25.041
COMING IN FROM THE TROPICAL
PACIFIC OCEAN.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.417
- THAT'S WAY TOO TECHNICAL.
- THAT'S VERY TECHNICAL, DEB.

10:27.417 --> 10:30.125
- WELL, ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS
ARE FASCINATING THINGS, GRANT.

10:30.125 --> 10:33.125
THEY'RE TYPICALLY SEVERAL
,

10:33.125 --> 10:34.875
WHILE ONLY
A FEW HUNDRED WIDE.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.375
- I LIKE TO THINK OF IT
LIKE A GIANT

10:36.375 --> 10:37.917
WATER LOG SHOELACE
IN THE SKY.

10:37.917 --> 10:40.458
- WELL, THAT'S--
THAT'S QUITE A VISUAL, DEB.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.208
SO WHAT IS THIS SHOELACE
BRINGING US?

10:42.208 --> 10:44.542
- WELL, A SINGLE ATMOSPHERIC
RIVER CAN CARRY

10:44.542 --> 10:45.834
A GREATER FLOW OF WATER

10:45.834 --> 10:48.583
THAN THE LARGEST RIVER
ON EARTH, THE AMAZON.

10:48.583 --> 10:50.792
- SO THAT'S GOOD FOR DROUGHT?
- A RIVER OF WATER SHOULD HELP

10:50.792 --> 10:52.417
WITH THE DROUGHT HERE
IN CALIFORNIA, SHOULDN'T IT?

10:52.417 --> 10:54.500
- WELL, THE FIRST STORM
TONIGHT ACTUALLY

10:54.500 --> 10:57.125
WILL JUST BE A LIGHT SHOWER,
BUT THE SECOND STORM TOMORROW

10:57.125 --> 10:58.917
WILL DRENCH US,
WHICH SHOULD HELP.

10:58.917 --> 11:01.709
BUT AFTER THE FIRES
THAT WE HAD EARLIER THIS YEAR,

11:01.709 --> 11:03.542
RESIDENTS IN THE BURN AREA
SHOULD BE ON THE LOOKOUT

11:03.542 --> 11:04.959
FOR FLOODING AND
POSSIBLE MUDSLIDES.

11:04.959 --> 11:07.083
- WELL, YOU HAVE COME
TO OUR RESCUE TONIGHT, DEB.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.583
AND YOU MAY HAVE JUST SAVED
THOSE RESIDENTS

11:08.583 --> 11:09.959
IN THE BURN AREAS, TOO.

11:09.959 --> 11:11.583
THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP
ON TONIGHT'S SHOW.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.583
- MY PLEASURE, GRANT.
[laughs]

11:13.583 --> 11:17.667
[dial tone]
HELLO?

11:17.667 --> 11:21.208
- APPARENTLY, FLETCH'S DECISION
YESTERDAY WAS FINAL.

11:21.208 --> 11:22.458
- HE'S NOT COMING BACK.

11:22.458 --> 11:25.208
BUT HE'S UNDER CONTRACT,
LEGAL'S ON IT.

11:25.208 --> 11:28.583
- THAT PUTS US IN A REALLY
BAD SPOT MOVING FORWARD.

11:28.583 --> 11:30.417
- I REALLY THOUGHT HE'D COOL
DOWN AND I'LL BE ABLE TO TALK

11:30.417 --> 11:32.417
HIM OUT OF IT,
BUT HE WON'T RETURN MY CALL.

11:32.417 --> 11:34.959
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THE GUY
FROM KBDD IN HERE, SPIELMAN?

11:34.959 --> 11:36.375
- ALREADY CHECKED ON THAT.

11:36.375 --> 11:37.500
- WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
MONEY TO GET HIM OUT

11:37.500 --> 11:39.000
OF HIS CONTRACT OVER THERE.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.166
- OH, COME ON.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.709
THE SOCIAL MEDIA NUMBERS
ARE REALLY GOOD ON DEB.

11:43.709 --> 11:45.208
WHAT YOU DO SAY WE GET HER
IN HERE?

11:45.208 --> 11:47.000
LET HER READ THE WEATHER,
JUST SEE HOW IT GOES.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.875
- COME WITH ME, I WANT TO
SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

11:50.875 --> 11:53.291
- UH, OKAY.

11:53.291 --> 11:56.208
[phone ringing]

11:56.208 --> 11:57.458
- THIS IS DEB.

11:57.458 --> 11:58.667
- HEY, DEB.
QUENTIN STERLING AGAIN.

11:58.667 --> 12:01.333
YOU WERE A BIG HIT HERE
LAST NIGHT.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.250
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD
WANT TO COME IN HERE

12:03.250 --> 12:06.417
AND READ THE WEATHER
ON CAMERA FOR US TODAY?

12:06.417 --> 12:08.166
- [laughs]

12:08.166 --> 12:09.917
- I'M A METEOROLOGIST,
MR. STERLING,

12:09.917 --> 12:11.250
NOT A WEATHER GIRL.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.875
- LOOK, THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO
KNOWS YOUR VOICE.

12:12.875 --> 12:15.000
I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT THEY KNOW YOUR FACE.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
- I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.583
I'M A PhD CANDIDATE.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.959
I HAVE A DISSERTATION TO FINISH,
A FELLOWSHIP TO APPLY FOR--

12:20.959 --> 12:22.375
HEY, I THINK
IT'S GOOD FOR US TO TRY

12:22.375 --> 12:24.000
AND OVERCOME OUR FEARS, RIGHT?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.875
- PLUS THIS COULD BE A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU

12:25.875 --> 12:30.166
TO RAISE YOUR PROFILE
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.583
- HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING
TO DR. HARRIS?

12:31.583 --> 12:33.542
- WHO?
- NOTHING.

12:33.542 --> 12:39.000
- LOOK, IT'S JUST FOR TODAY.
AND, UH...

12:39.000 --> 12:41.125
WHAT CAN I SAY,
WE PAY FAR MORE THAN RADIO.

12:51.333 --> 12:52.542
- I'M KIMMY.
- HI, I'M DEB.

12:52.542 --> 12:54.000
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.625
- COME RIGHT THIS WAY.
THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU.

12:55.625 --> 12:57.709
- YEAH, IT DOESN'T MATCH UP
WITH THE OTHER THING WE FOUND

12:57.709 --> 12:58.875
BECAUSE THE DATES ARE WRONG.

12:58.875 --> 13:01.375
- AFTER YOU.

13:01.375 --> 13:05.625
- WELL, IT WAS REVISED.
THAT'S WHY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN--

13:05.625 --> 13:07.125
- GOOD LUCK, GOLDEN BOY.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.959

13:17.125 --> 13:18.458

ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

13:18.458 --> 13:19.709

13:19.709 --> 13:21.250

13:28.542 --> 13:30.709
WHAT EXACTLY DOES
THE NEWS DIRECTOR DO?

14:18.041 --> 14:19.625
- TIME FOR WHAT?
- YOUR MAKEOVER.

14:19.625 --> 14:20.792
- I DIDN'T KNOW
I HAD TO THAT.

14:20.792 --> 14:22.959
- THINK OF IT AS A BONUS PERK.

14:22.959 --> 14:24.166
- EVERYONE WEARS MAKEUP.

14:24.166 --> 14:25.458

SHE NEEDS MUCH,

14:41.875 --> 14:44.250
- OKAY.
OPEN AND RELAX.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.458
- THEY SHOULD'VE CLEARED
THIS WITH ME.

14:51.875 --> 14:53.125
WE'RE NOT DOING THE PRETTY
YOUNG WEATHERWOMAN THING.

14:53.125 --> 14:57.125
WE'RE GONNA KEEP THE FOCUS
ON THE NEWS.

14:57.125 --> 15:01.083
OH, SHE'S PERFECT.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.000

15:55.291 --> 15:57.458
- THREE, TWO...

15:57.458 --> 15:59.166
- GOOD EVENING FOLKS,

15:59.166 --> 16:00.125
AND HERE'S THE LATEST.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.208
WEATHER, STILL OUR TOP STORY.

16:02.208 --> 16:03.542
NOW, YOU KNOW HER VOICE

16:03.542 --> 16:05.333
FROM OUR LOCAL COLLEGE
RADIO STATION.

16:05.333 --> 16:08.417
HERE SHE IS IN PERSON,
METEOROLOGIST, DEB METCALFE.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.041
THANKS FOR FILLING IN TODAY,
DEB.

16:10.041 --> 16:11.542
- MY PLEASURE, GRANT.

16:11.542 --> 16:13.125
- NOW, YOU'RE AN ACTUAL
METEOROLOGIST, RIGHT?

16:13.125 --> 16:14.375
- YES, I AM.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.333
I HAVE MY MASTER'S DEGREE
IN METEOROLOGY

16:16.333 --> 16:19.333
AND I'M CURRENTLY WORKING
TOWARDS MY PhD.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.583
METEOROLOGISTS ARE INVOLVED
IN EVERYTHING

16:21.583 --> 16:24.333
FROM AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL
TO RESEARCHING CLIMATE TRENDS,

16:24.333 --> 16:25.917
WHICH AFFECT THINGS
LIKE FARMING,

16:25.917 --> 16:27.458
FOREST FIRES AND
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS.

16:27.458 --> 16:28.792
- AT LAST, THE NEWSROOM
SOUNDS SMART.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.750
- BUT NO ACTUAL METEORS
TO SPEAK OF?

16:30.750 --> 16:32.166
- WELL, ACTUALLY...
- SPOKE TOO SOON.

16:32.166 --> 16:34.000
- THE EARTH IS ABOUT TO TAKE
ITS ANNUAL CRUISE THROUGH

16:34.000 --> 16:37.500
THE LEONID METEOR BELT,
WHICH IS A SPECTACULAR SIGHT.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.542
- WHAT ABOUT ASTEROIDS?
- OH, WELL,

16:39.542 --> 16:41.250
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WATCH
AN OLD BRUCE WILLIS MOVIE

16:41.250 --> 16:43.917
FROM '98 IF YOU WANT
TO SEE THOSE.

16:43.917 --> 16:46.750
- WELL, IF NO ASTEROIDS,
THEN WHAT WILL OUR SKIES

16:46.750 --> 16:49.375
BE BRINGING US TONIGHT?
- WELL, THIS HIGH PRESSURE

16:49.375 --> 16:52.625
SYSTEM IN THE NORTH WILL PUSH
A DENSE MASS OF COLD AIR

16:52.625 --> 16:55.000
DOWN THE WEST COAST ACTING LIKE
A BIG PUSH BROOM

16:55.000 --> 16:57.583
SWEEPING AWAY
ALL THIS TROPICAL ACTIVITY.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.750
WE'LL BE BACK LATER ON...
- SHE'S PRETTY GOOD.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.208
- YOU'RE DOING GREAT, DEB.

17:01.208 --> 17:02.625
COME ON, LET'S GO
TO THE TRAFFIC NOW.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.625
- THANKS, DEB.
WE'LL HAVE MORE WEATHER DETAILS

17:04.625 --> 17:06.125
LATER IN THE BROADCAST.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.125
NOW LET'S GET TO LOCAL NEWS.

17:08.125 --> 17:10.834
[bell ring

17:10.834 --> 17:12.709
- QUENTIN, I WAS
JUST TELLING DEB HERE

17:12.709 --> 17:13.875
THAT SHE SHOULD APPLY
FOR THE JOB.

17:13.875 --> 17:17.500
- SHE'S A PERFECT FOIL FOR ME.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.500
- YOU DID A GOOD JOB TODAY.
- THANKS.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.666
MAYBE IT WILL HELP ME OUT
VERSUS VERA.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.416
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.583
I GOT TO GO.
I GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

17:25.583 --> 17:28.000
- OKAY.
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.667
SO DOES THE RADIO GIG TAKE UP
A LOT OF YOUR TIME?

17:30.667 --> 17:33.417
- NO, THE RADIO SHOW ONLY TAKES
LIKE TEN MINUTES A DAY

17:33.417 --> 17:36.333
BUT I'M BUSY FINISHING
MY DISSERTATION AND TRYING

17:36.333 --> 17:38.291
TO LOCK IN ONE OF THE
FELLOWSHIPS BEING AWARDED

17:38.291 --> 17:40.208
TO GRADUATING PhDs
FOR NEXT YEAR.

17:40.208 --> 17:41.875
- WOW.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.625
BUT IN THE FELLOWSHIP,
THAT'S LIKE A RESEARCH POSITION

17:43.625 --> 17:46.667
AT THE UNIVERSITY, RIGHT?
- PRESTIGIOUS RESEARCH JOB,

17:46.667 --> 17:49.000
IT ALMOST GUARANTEES
A PROFESSORSHIP

17:49.000 --> 17:51.667
WITHIN A FEW YEARS,
SO IT IS DOG-EAT-DOG

17:51.667 --> 17:54.375
AMONGST THE CANDIDATES
RIGHT NOW.

17:54.375 --> 17:56.792
- I ALWAYS IMAGINED THE ACADEMIC
TYPES VERY CALMLY DISCUSSING

17:56.792 --> 17:59.166
ISSUES USING VERY BIG WORDS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.667
- THAT'S A CLICHE.

18:00.667 --> 18:05.000
DON'T STEP INTO THAT PUDDLE
OF DIHYDROGEN MONOXIDE.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.750
- H2O?
- YEAH.

18:09.750 --> 18:13.542
- WAS IT ANY FUN?
- IT WAS IN A WAY.

18:13.542 --> 18:15.583
- WELL, THANKS FOR
COMING ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

18:15.583 --> 18:18.375
- NO PROBLEM.

18:40.917 --> 18:42.917
- YOU WERE ON TV?

18:42.917 --> 18:44.709
IT WAS SO CRAZY,
I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING.

18:44.709 --> 18:45.834
- NO.
WAS I THAT BAD?

18:45.834 --> 18:47.500
- NO, YOU WERE GREAT.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.166
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU
WERE DOING THAT?

18:49.166 --> 18:51.000
- JUST KIND OF POPPED UP
LAST MINUTE.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.834
IT WAS JUST A FILL-IN,
ONE TIME THING.

18:52.834 --> 18:54.333
- YOU WOULD THINK I'D BE
USED TO SEEING YOU ON SCREEN

18:54.333 --> 18:56.250
SINCE YOU'RE IN MY DOCUMENTARY.

18:56.250 --> 18:57.792
- I SAW THEY GOT YOU
TO WEAR LIPSTICK.

18:57.792 --> 18:59.375
- I'VE TALKED MORE
ABOUT MAKEUP TODAY

18:59.375 --> 19:00.834
THAN I HAVE
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

19:00.834 --> 19:04.500
[laughter]

19:04.500 --> 19:06.959
- THANK YOU FOR THOSE CHANGES.
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.583
- QUENTIN.
- TALK TO ME.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.834
- THE STATION MANAGER WANTS DEB
TO FILL IN SHORT-TERM

19:10.834 --> 19:12.542
WHILE WE LOOK FOR A SUITABLE
FULL-TIME REPLACEMENT.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.041
- SERIOUSLY?

19:14.041 --> 19:15.250
- PHONE'S BEEN RINGING
OFF THE HOOK,

19:15.250 --> 19:16.458
EMAILS POURING IN.
- I DON'T KNOW THOUGH.

19:16.458 --> 19:17.667
I DON'T THINK
SHE'S GONNA GO FOR IT.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.291
TURNS OUT SHE'S A PRETTY
SERIOUS ACADEMIC.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.250
- WELL, I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF TELLING THE STATION MANAGER

19:21.250 --> 19:22.250
YOU COULD DELIVER.

19:22.250 --> 19:23.792
IT'S A BIG CREATIVE DECISION.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.792
YOUR CALL, RIGHT?

19:28.917 --> 19:33.875
[phone ringing]
- OH, HANG ON.

19:33.875 --> 19:35.834
- HELLO?
- DEB, QUENTIN STERLING.

19:35.834 --> 19:37.583
I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LATE.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.583
- UH, HI, QUENTIN.

19:39.583 --> 19:41.917
NO, NOT AT ALL,
I JUST GOT HOME.

19:41.917 --> 19:43.041
WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH?

19:43.041 --> 19:44.625
-WELL, IT TURNS OUT
OUR AUDIENCE LOVES YOU.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.333
- SO WE WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU WOULD FILIN

19:46.333 --> 19:47.875
WHILE WE SEARCH IN
FOR A FULL-TIME REPLACEMENT.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.709
MAYBE A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

19:49.709 --> 19:51.125
- THEY WANT ME TO KEEP
DOING THE WEATHER.

19:51.125 --> 19:52.834
- YES!

19:52.834 --> 19:56.709
- UM, I'M FLATTERED, BUT...

19:56.709 --> 19:58.250
I'M NOT A WEATHER GIRL.

19:58.250 --> 19:59.917
- I KNOW,
YOU'RE A METEOROLOGIST,

19:59.917 --> 20:01.667
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHY WE WANT YOU.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.834
LOOK, JUST DON'T RUSH
INTO THIS DECISION.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.208
WE CAN--WE CAN FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

20:06.208 --> 20:08.709
- THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH HOURS
IN THE DAY AS IT IS.

20:08.709 --> 20:12.000
- WELL, MAYBE I CAN
MAKE THE DAY LONGER.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.667
- PULL THAT OFF
AND WE'LL TALK.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.583
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM ME SOON.

20:15.583 --> 20:16.917
- THANKS FOR THE OFFER.

20:16.917 --> 20:21.083
- HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
- BYE.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.792
- REALLY?

20:25.333 --> 20:27.583
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THE WEATHER ON TV?

20:27.583 --> 20:29.625
IT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY
COOL OPPORTUNITY.

20:29.625 --> 20:31.500
- DR. HARRIS JUST SAID
THAT I HAD TO STAND OUT.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.667
AND NOW THAT'S HAPPENED, I NEED
TO FOCUS ON THIS FELLOWSHIP.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.917
- EVERYONE KNOWS
YOU'RE THE BEST RESEARCHER.

20:36.917 --> 20:38.834
THEY HAVE TO GIVE YOU E
OF THOSE FELLOWSHIPS.

20:38.834 --> 20:40.208
- YEAH. BUT IT'S ALSO
REALLY POLITICAL,

20:40.208 --> 20:42.458
AND I'M CLUELESS
ABOUT POLITICS, UNLIKE VERA.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.542
- YOU JUST HAVE TO STOP
HIDING BEHIND THE WEATHER

20:44.542 --> 20:46.166
AND STAND IN FRONT OF IT.

20:46.166 --> 20:50.000
- OH, YOU MEAN LIKE WITH
A GREEN-SCREEN ON TV?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.750
- JUST LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE,
PEOPLE LOVE IT.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.792
- PEOPLE?
- YES, PEOPLE, INCLUDING MEN.

20:55.792 --> 20:58.000
- PLEASE, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THAT.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.667
- YOU NEVER HAVE ENOUGH TIME.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.375
- SPEAKING OF TIME,
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET BACK

21:01.375 --> 21:05.250
TO MY DISSERTATION.
- YOU CAN'T IGNORE ME.

21:05.250 --> 21:08.959
- ALL RIGHT.
MAYBE YOU CAN.

21:08.959 --> 21:11.333
- I'M WORKING ON A HUNCH
THAT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO YOU.

21:11.333 --> 21:14.500
WHAT'S MY TIME FRAME HERE?
- THE SOONER, THE BETTER.

21:14.500 --> 21:15.667
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY NAME
THAT'SOUNCING AROUND

21:15.667 --> 21:17.667
FOR THIS JOB.
- YEAH.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.291
YEAH, I KNOW
HOW NEW YORK WORKS.

21:19.291 --> 21:22.458
I NEED TO--OH, I GOT TO GO.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

21:36.125 --> 21:38.125
- TOLD YOU I DON'T GIVE UP.

21:38.125 --> 21:41.250
- YOU WEREN'T KIDDING.

21:41.250 --> 21:42.583
STALK PEOPLE MUCH?
- [laughs]

21:42.583 --> 21:45.750
- WELL, I BELIEVE IN BEING
PERSISTENT

21:45.750 --> 21:47.208
WHEN I WANT SOMETHING.

21:47.208 --> 21:48.750
- OH. WELL, I'M SORRY,

21:48.750 --> 21:52.041
BUT NOTHING'S
CHANGED SINCE LAST NIGHT.

21:52.041 --> 21:54.041
I'M SURE ONE OF THESE OTHER
GIRLS CAN READ THE WEATHER

21:54.041 --> 21:55.750
FOR YOUR STATION.

21:55.750 --> 21:57.583
- YOU'D THINK BUT WE'VE TRIED.
NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO READ.

21:57.583 --> 22:01.417
- [laughs]

22:01.417 --> 22:03.333
THANK YOU.
- MM-HMM.

22:03.333 --> 22:06.583
WE CAN SET AN OFFICE UP
FOR YOU AT THE STUDIO.

22:06.583 --> 22:08.333
THAT WAY YOU WON'T
HAVE TO GO BACK AND FORTH.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.625
WHATEVER YOU WANT, WE CAN
EVEN CONNECT YOU REMOTELY

22:10.625 --> 22:12.125
TO THE COMPUTERS HERE
AT THE WEATHER CENTER.

22:12.125 --> 22:15.291
I ALREADY CHECKED WITH YOUR
TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT ON THAT.

22:15.291 --> 22:17.458
- IT'S A BIT PRESUMPTUOUS OF YOU
TO POKE AROUND MY WORKPLACE,

22:17.458 --> 22:18.959
DON'T YOU THINK?
- YEAH.

22:18.959 --> 22:21.291
AS I SAID I'M--
- PERSISTENT, RIGHT.

22:21.291 --> 22:23.417
- LOOK, WE WILL DO ANYTHING
AND EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN DO

22:23.417 --> 22:25.583
TO WORK AROUND YOUR SCHEDULE,
OKAY?

22:25.583 --> 22:28.667
AND AS I MENTIONED,
PAYS MUCH BETTER THAN RADIO.

22:28.667 --> 22:33.250
- WHAT'S THAT?
- IT'S YOUR OFFER PAPERWORK.

22:33.250 --> 22:34.834
- I APPRECIATE THIS.

22:34.834 --> 22:37.542
I REALLY DO,
BUT THIS IS MY LIFE.

22:37.542 --> 22:38.750
- I KNOW AND THAT'S WHY
WE WANT YOU,

22:38.750 --> 22:40.125
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.792
- I HAVE A MEETING.
- OKAY.

22:41.792 --> 22:46.291
OKAY, LOOK, READ THAT OVER
AND THEN GIVE ME A CALL.

22:48.041 --> 22:51.041
GOOD LUCK IN YOUR MEETING.

22:54.542 --> 22:57.041
- DEB.
- VERA.

22:57.041 --> 22:59.458
- WHAT'S THIS I HEAR ABOUT
YOU DOING THE NEWS YESTERDAY?

22:59.458 --> 23:02.041
- KFZA CALLED ME TO FILL IN,
SO I DID.

23:02.041 --> 23:05.291
- I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY THEY'D
CHOOSE YOU OF ALL PEOPLE.

23:05.291 --> 23:08.709
- I DO UNDERSTAND,
AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THAT.

23:08.709 --> 23:12.083
- OH, IT'S DAVID.
I MEAN, DR. CRENSHAW.

23:12.083 --> 23:13.083
- OH, SPEAKING OF WHICH.

23:13.083 --> 23:14.959
VERA, DEAR, HOW ARE YOU?

23:14.959 --> 23:18.166
- "OH, IT'S DAVID."
- HOW GOES IT?

23:18.166 --> 23:20.333
- [imitating]
YOU LOOK STUNNING TODAY.

23:20.333 --> 23:22.667
- ARE YOU STUDYING?
- OF COURSE, I'M ON TOP OF IT.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.125
- UGH.

23:24.125 --> 23:26.166
- WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.
I MUST GO.

23:26.166 --> 23:28.417
- OF COURSE.
- THANK YOU.

23:31.959 --> 23:34.917
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION,
EVERYONE.

23:34.917 --> 23:36.333
DR. CRENSHAW
HAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.834
- IT WON'T TAKE A MOMENT.
THANK YOU, DR. HARRIS.

23:37.834 --> 23:40.333
NOW, I'M AFRAID TO SAY
THAT THERE WILL BE

23:40.333 --> 23:42.667
CROSS-CAMPUS BUDGET CUTS,
INCLUDING ALL OF US HERE

23:42.667 --> 23:44.166
AT THE WEATHER CENTER.

23:44.166 --> 23:47.500
- WE DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS YET,
BUT ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN

23:47.500 --> 23:50.583
AND THAT MEANS THERE WILL ONLY
BE ONE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP

23:50.583 --> 23:54.875
AWARDED AMONG THIS YEAR'S
CROP OF DOCTORAL CANDIDATES.

23:54.875 --> 23:57.667
AS YOU KNOW,
AT THE END OF THE TERM,

23:57.667 --> 23:59.500
EACH CANDIDATE HAS
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

23:59.500 --> 24:02.208
A PRESENTATION IN FRONT OF THE
COMMITTEE ON THEIR OWN BEHALF.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.208
THIS NEWS MAKES
THAT PRESENTATION

24:04.208 --> 24:06.500
ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT,
DOESN'T IT?

24:06.500 --> 24:08.792
NOW, THIS IS THE HARD PART.

24:08.792 --> 24:11.208
THIS IS SIMPLY
A DREADFUL CASE OF

24:11.208 --> 24:14.709
"MAY THE BEST MAN
OR WOMAN WIN."

24:14.709 --> 24:19.834
THANK YOU.
DR. HARRIS.

24:19.834 --> 24:23.709
- THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

24:37.166 --> 24:39.166
DEB.

24:43.083 --> 24:45.208
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I WAS
GONNA HAVE TO BE COMPETING

24:45.208 --> 24:46.709
WITH MY COLLEAGUES
FOR ONE FELLOWSHIP.

24:46.709 --> 24:48.291
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

24:48.291 --> 24:50.834
NOW, I SAW YOU ON TV
THE OTHER NIGHT.

24:50.834 --> 24:52.542
YOU WERE GREAT.
- YEAH.

24:52.542 --> 24:54.333
ONLY BECAUSE THE ANCHORMAN
WAS FEEDING ME QUESTIONS

24:54.333 --> 24:57.083
AND I WAS REPORTING THE FACTS.

24:57.083 --> 24:59.125
I WAS JUST ME TALKING ABOUT
WHAT I LOVE.

24:59.125 --> 25:02.583
AND NOW I HAVE TO SELL SOME
PERFECT, POLISHED,

25:02.583 --> 25:05.959
REHEARSED VERSION
OF MYSELF LIKE VERA?

25:05.959 --> 25:07.500
- SAYS WHO?

25:07.500 --> 25:10.667
LET VERA BE VERA,
YOU BE DEB.

25:10.667 --> 25:12.667
- 'CAUSE THAT'LL WORK.

25:22.458 --> 25:26.625
- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KEEP
YOUR EYES ON THE PRIZE

25:26.625 --> 25:30.333
AND DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER
TO WIN THIS FELLOWSHIP.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.834
- I ALREADY AM DOING
EVERYTHING I CAN.

25:32.834 --> 25:36.291
- TELL ME ABOUT THIS
JOB OFFER.

25:36.291 --> 25:39.917
- IT'S THE ON-AIR
WEATHER POSITION FOR KFZA TV.

25:39.917 --> 25:41.333
IT'S THE SAME THING
I DID LAST NIGHT

25:41.333 --> 25:42.542
EXCEPT FOR MANY NIGHTS
TO COME.

25:42.542 --> 25:45.125
- THIS IS PERFECT.
SO?

25:45.125 --> 25:47.792
- SO, I TOLD HIM
I COULDN'T DO IT.

25:47.792 --> 25:51.041
- DEB, I TOLD YOU
THAT YOU NEED TO STAND OUT.

25:51.041 --> 25:53.417
NOW, THIS COULD GIVE YOU
AN EDGE OVER THE COMPETITION.

25:53.417 --> 25:55.959
- BECAUSE HARD WORK
AND DEDICATION AREN'T ENOUGH.

25:59.083 --> 26:01.250
- HOW BADLY DO YOU WANT THIS?

26:21.333 --> 26:24.166
- WE ARE THRILLED
TO HAVE YOU HERE, DEB.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.917
- WELL, I'D BE LYING IF
I SAID I WASN'T NERVOUS.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.208
- OH, WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

26:28.208 --> 26:31.041
- EXPLAIN TO ME THE HIERARCHY
AROUND HERE AGAIN.

26:31.041 --> 26:32.583
- OKAY, SO JOSH,
THE GUY IN THE SUIT,

26:32.583 --> 26:34.208
HE'S THE NEWS PRODUCER,

26:34.208 --> 26:35.667
WHICH MEANS HE OVERSEES
THIS WHOLE OPERATION.

26:35.667 --> 26:37.125
AND THEN
I'M THE NEWS DIRECTOR,

26:37.125 --> 26:38.750
WHICH MEANS I'M IN CHARGE
OF THE TALENT AND THE CONTENT.

26:38.750 --> 26:41.500
- OH, SO YOU DO
THE HIRING AND FIRING.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.041
- YEAH, BUT THIS IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT HERE.

26:44.041 --> 26:47.291
THIS IS CRAFT SERVICES.
- AH, MS. METCALFE!

26:47.291 --> 26:49.208
I'M GLAD THAT YOU DECIDED TO
JOIN THE TEAM.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.166
- THANKS.

26:51.166 --> 26:54.041
- MY FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE--
ENJOY THE PERKS.

26:54.041 --> 26:56.000
- OOH.
- IT'S TRUE.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.583
[phone beeping]
OH, WAIT.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.041
OH, EXCUSE ME.

26:59.041 --> 27:00.959
- YOU KNOW,
FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS,

27:00.959 --> 27:04.041
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TUNING IN
NOT TO HEAR THE NEWS

27:04.041 --> 27:05.792
BUT TO HEAR ME
TELL THEM THE NEWS.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.000
TO SOME,
I'M A FATHER FIGURE.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.041
TO OTHERS, BIG BROTHER,
PERHAPS A HUSBAND.

27:11.041 --> 27:12.917
- OH, YOU'RE ALL THAT
AND MORE, GRANT.

27:12.917 --> 27:16.583
- HUSH.
I'M IMPARTING WISDOM HERE.

27:16.583 --> 27:18.834
ALWAYS REMEMBER
TO BE YOURSELF,

27:18.834 --> 27:21.333
OR AT LEAST AN ON-SCREEN
VERSION OF YOURSELF

27:21.333 --> 27:23.875
THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON.
- THAT MAKES SENSE.

27:28.792 --> 27:31.709
BOY, HE IS REALLY SOMETHING.
- OH, YES, HE IS.

27:31.709 --> 27:34.250
UH, YEAH, LET ME SHOW
YOU THE NEWSROOM.

27:34.250 --> 27:35.750
THIS IS THE NEWSROOM.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.750
THIS IS WHERE WE MEET
TO WRITE, RESEARCH,

27:37.750 --> 27:39.083
PLAN EVERY SINGLE BROADCAST.

27:39.083 --> 27:40.583
WE BOARD THE SHOW HERE.

27:40.583 --> 27:43.417
- MY BEST FRIEND
IS A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER.

27:43.417 --> 27:45.250
SHE SAID THAT THE MOTTO
FOR THE NEWS IS,

27:45.250 --> 27:46.917
"IF IT BLEEDS, IT LEADS?"

27:46.917 --> 27:49.583
- I DON'T BELIEVE IN EXPLOITING
OTHER PEOPLE'S MISFORTUNES.

27:49.583 --> 27:53.000
I JUST REALLY TRY TO FOCUS
ON TELLING A GREAT STORY AND,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.333
YOU KNOW, FINDING THAT THING,
THAT ONE THING THAT REALLY

27:55.333 --> 27:58.083
GRABS THE VIEWER AND
THAT IS WHERE YOU COME IN.

27:58.083 --> 27:59.333
- YEAH.
HERE YOU GO.

27:59.333 --> 28:00.542
I GOT A FEELING YOU'RE GONNA
BRING SOMETHING

28:00.542 --> 28:02.041
NEW TO THE WEATHER.

28:02.041 --> 28:03.834
- OH, WELL, I'M AFRAID
WE'RE STUCK WITH RAIN,

28:03.834 --> 28:06.125
WIND, HAIL IF WE'RE LUCKY.

28:06.125 --> 28:07.917
- HEY, DEB.
GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

28:07.917 --> 28:10.125
I'VE BEEN PULLING LOOKS FOR YOU.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.625
- LOOKS?
- YEAH.

28:11.625 --> 28:14.375
WARDROBE, HAIR,
YOUR ON-SCREEN PERSONA.

28:14.375 --> 28:16.875
- OH, WELL,
GRANT WAS JUST TELLING ME

28:16.875 --> 28:19.417
TO BE AS MUCH MYSELF
AS POSSIBLE ON CAMERA,

28:19.417 --> 28:23.041
SO THIS IS PRETTY MUCH IT.

28:23.041 --> 28:24.959
- MAYBE JUST A BIT.

28:24.959 --> 28:26.291
- I DON'T THINK DEB
NEEDS A NEW LOOK.

28:26.291 --> 28:27.709
I THINK, YOU KNOW,

28:27.709 --> 28:29.458
THE VIEWERS LIKED
HER OLD LOOK, RIGHT?

28:29.458 --> 28:33.166
- [chuckles]

28:33.166 --> 28:37.250
- DON'T WORRY,
SHE'S AN ARTIST, IT'S OKAY.

28:37.250 --> 28:40.291
AND THIS IS YOUR OFFICE.

28:42.709 --> 28:46.875
- OH, WOW.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.959
- THIS IS THE BIGGEST CUBICLE
I'VE EVER SEEN.

28:48.959 --> 28:52.291
- YEAH.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING.

28:52.291 --> 28:55.166
- MS. METCALFE,
HERE'S YOUR CONTRACT.

28:55.166 --> 28:56.959
- THANK YOU.

28:56.959 --> 28:59.291
- WE'RE VERY PROTECTIVE
OF OUR ON-AIR TALENT,

28:59.291 --> 29:01.333
SO YOU'RE EXCLUSIVE
WHILE YOU'RE HERE,

29:01.333 --> 29:03.375
WHICH MEANS YOU'LL HAVE
TO QUIT THAT COLLEGE RADIO GIG.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.583
- OH.

29:07.834 --> 29:10.291
OH, OKAY.
UM...

29:15.834 --> 29:18.041
- WELCOME TO KFZA NEWS.

29:21.792 --> 29:24.500
- YEAH.
THIS IS SO SURREAL.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.500
- YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.959
I'M TELLING YOU, I HAVE
A GREAT FEELING ABOUT THIS.

29:28.959 --> 29:30.667
- HEY, QUENTIN.

29:30.667 --> 29:33.625
I THINK IN ALL THE CRAZINESS
I FORGOT TO SAY THANK YOU.

29:33.625 --> 29:35.542
- OH, NO.
THANK YOU, DEB.

29:38.709 --> 29:40.083
- [laughs]

29:43.208 --> 29:47.875
- I HAVE NO IDEA HOW SHE PLANS
TO BE RESPECTED AS AN ACADEMIC.

29:47.875 --> 29:51.458
SHE'S PARADING AROUND
LIKE A WEATHER GIRL.

29:51.458 --> 29:53.041
IT'S RIDULOUS.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.625
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'LL SEE YOU
GUYS NEXT WEEK.

29:54.625 --> 29:57.458
OKAY, BYE.
BYE.

29:57.458 --> 29:58.959
- OH, HELLO, VERA.
- OH, HI.

29:58.959 --> 30:01.583
- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
both: A SPEECH AND

30:01.583 --> 30:03.166
A PRESENTATION.
- ALL RIGHT?

30:03.166 --> 30:04.375
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

30:04.375 --> 30:05.667
- OH, YOU'RE MOST VERY WELCOME.
ALL RIGHT.

30:05.667 --> 30:06.583
- THANK YOU.
- TA-TA.

30:06.583 --> 30:08.500
GOOD LUCK.
- OKAY, BYE.

30:08.500 --> 30:12.333
[dialing phone]

30:16.417 --> 30:18.792
- I'M GRANT MARSHALL,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

30:18.792 --> 30:20.834
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

30:20.834 --> 30:24.125
[bell rings]

30:24.125 --> 30:25.500
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

30:25.500 --> 30:27.583
YOU DIDN'T SEEM LIKE YOURSELF
TONIGHT.

30:30.083 --> 30:33.667
- CAN WE GET UP TO THE ROOF?

30:35.583 --> 30:37.166
- HOW IS IT POSSIBLE
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF

30:37.166 --> 30:39.959
THIS ANNUAL METEOR SHOWER.

30:39.959 --> 30:43.417
- WELL, IT'S LIKE MY DAD,
THE PHYSICIST SAYS.

30:43.417 --> 30:45.333
THERE'S SO MUCH TO KNOW,
YOU CAN'T KNOW IT ALL.

30:45.333 --> 30:48.291
- SO YOUR MOM,
WAS SHE A SCIENTIST, TOO?

30:48.291 --> 30:52.750
- NO, SHE WAS A ARTIST...
AND A BIT OF A HIPPIE.

30:52.750 --> 30:55.333
- I GUESS THAT'S
WHERE YOU GET ME--

30:55.333 --> 30:57.291
NATURE-LOVING SCIENCE NERD.

30:57.291 --> 30:58.625
- AND YOU GREW UP HERE
IN SAN DIEGO?

30:58.625 --> 31:01.041
- BORN AND RAISED.

31:01.041 --> 31:02.792
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY PLACE
BETTER.

31:02.792 --> 31:05.917
- YEAH, IT IS A GREAT
LITTLE CITY.

31:05.917 --> 31:08.166
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

31:08.166 --> 31:10.458
- OH, GOSH.

31:10.458 --> 31:11.917
I'VE BOUNCED ALL OVER
THE COUNTRY, YOU KNOW.

31:11.917 --> 31:13.458
- WHY?

31:13.458 --> 31:14.583
- OH, I'VE BEEN
WORKING MY WAY

31:14.583 --> 31:16.792
UP THE BROADCAST NEWS
FOOD CHAIN.

31:16.792 --> 31:19.709
SO, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S JUST HOW IT GOES.

31:19.709 --> 31:21.625
YOU GET A JOB, YOU BOOST
THE RATINGS, THEN YOU MOVE ON.

31:21.625 --> 31:26.250
- AND THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE?
I DIDN'T MEAN--NO OFFENSE.

31:26.250 --> 31:27.917
- NONE TAKEN.

31:27.917 --> 31:29.291
I, UM, I HAD A FALL

31:29.291 --> 31:33.291
FROM THE NETWORK NEWS LEVEL
IN NEW YORK.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.125
LONG BORING STORY.

31:35.125 --> 31:38.166
- MM.

31:38.166 --> 31:40.041
- TELL ME WHY METEOROLOGY.

31:40.041 --> 31:43.000
- WELL, WHEN I WAS A KID,
I SAW THIS DISPLAY

31:43.000 --> 31:45.667
AT THE CHILDREN'S MUSEUM
ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE,

31:45.667 --> 31:48.834
YOU KNOW, LIKE CLOUDS
THE SIZE OF MOUNTAINS,

31:48.834 --> 31:51.250
LIGHTNING STORMS,
THE AURORA BOREALIS.

31:51.250 --> 31:54.250
I MEAN,
ALL NATURAL OCCURRENCES.

31:54.250 --> 31:56.041
REAL LIFE.

31:56.041 --> 31:59.166
BUT...

31:59.166 --> 32:03.083
AT THE TIME,
IT JUST SEEMED SO...MAGICAL.

32:06.792 --> 32:08.500
PROBABLY SEEMS PRETTY SILLY.

32:08.500 --> 32:11.000
- NOT AT ALL.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.208
- OH.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.250
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY?

32:22.250 --> 32:24.375
- IT'S NOTHING.

32:24.375 --> 32:25.458
- TALK TO ME.

32:25.458 --> 32:27.000
- THIS JOB'S
JUST GETTING ME...

32:27.000 --> 32:29.542
NOTICED AT WORK.

32:29.542 --> 32:30.917
- THAT'S GREAT.

32:30.917 --> 32:33.208
- NO, NOT IN THE WAY
THAT I WANT.

32:33.208 --> 32:35.542
- OH, THEY'RE JUST JEALOUS.

32:35.542 --> 32:37.291
- OR I LOOK FOOLISH.

32:37.291 --> 32:39.875
- OKAY, I'M SORRY.
STOP.

32:39.875 --> 32:43.041
I'VE DIRECTED NETWORK NEWS.

32:43.041 --> 32:44.709
I CAN PROMISE YOU...

32:44.709 --> 32:48.291
YOU DON'T LOOK FOOLISH.

32:48.291 --> 32:50.542
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

32:54.583 --> 32:56.542
HEY, DO YOU WANT TO--

32:56.542 --> 32:59.417
DO YOU WANT
TO GET OUT OF HERE AND--

32:59.417 --> 33:02.500
I DON'T KNOW, GO GET
SOME COFFEE OR SOMETHING?

33:06.583 --> 33:10.291
- UH...

33:10.291 --> 33:12.333
I CAN'T.

33:12.333 --> 33:15.291
I HAVE A PAPER TO WRITE.

33:15.291 --> 33:18.667
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.291
[door unlocks]

33:26.291 --> 33:28.917
- HEY.
- HI.

33:28.917 --> 33:30.625
I THOUGHT YOU WERE WATCHING
THE METEOR SHOWER.

33:30.625 --> 33:33.709
- I DID, ON THE ROOF
OF THE STATION WITH QUENTIN.

33:33.709 --> 33:36.083
- STOP, REWIND.

33:36.083 --> 33:38.542
- IT WAS JUST STARGAZING,
FRAN.

33:38.542 --> 33:41.125
- YEAH, I ALWAYS GO ON ROOFS
WITH MY BOSS.

33:41.125 --> 33:42.959
- HE DID WANT TO
GET COFFEE AFTER.

33:42.959 --> 33:45.959
- DON'T TELL ME YOU SAID NO.
- I PANICKED.

33:45.959 --> 33:47.792
I SAID I HAD A PAPER TO WRITE,
WHICH I DO.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.417
- I KNEW IT.

33:49.417 --> 33:51.291
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE PANICKED
IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THIS GUY.

33:51.291 --> 33:53.333
- AT FIRST I THOUGHT
HE WAS TOO SLICK, A PLAYER,

33:53.333 --> 33:56.333
BUT NOW I FIND HIM
VERY INTERESTING.

33:56.333 --> 33:57.750
- HMM.

33:57.750 --> 33:59.750
WELL, MAYBE TOMORROW
YOU TAKE HIM UP ON THAT COFFEE.

33:59.750 --> 34:02.500
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

34:04.417 --> 34:06.458
- SO AS HOT AIR RISES,

34:06.458 --> 34:10.125
COLD AIR IS BROUGHT IN
FROM THE OCEAN.

34:10.125 --> 34:11.291
DO YOU GUYS THINK
WE COULD COME UP WITH,

34:11.291 --> 34:13.417
LIKE, AN ANIMATION FOR THAT?
- YEAH.

34:13.417 --> 34:15.291
- COOL.

34:15.291 --> 34:18.083
[indistinct chatter]

34:18.083 --> 34:20.667
TAKE A CHANCE.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.458
- JUST TRY IT ON.

34:22.458 --> 34:24.750
IT'S PERFECT,
NOT TOO OVER THE TOP.

34:24.750 --> 34:26.291
LET ME ADD A LITTLE COLOR
TO YOUR EYES.

34:26.291 --> 34:27.291
MAYBE LOSE THE GLASSES.

34:27.291 --> 34:29.833
- I REALLY DON'T
DO PANTSUITS.

34:43.041 --> 34:44.667
[sighs]

34:44.667 --> 34:46.667
- [laughs]
OKAY.

34:55.417 --> 34:56.458
- HEY, WEATHER GIRL.

34:56.458 --> 35:00.125
- I'M REALLY BUSY
RIGHT NOW, VERA.

35:00.125 --> 35:02.000
- I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE
TO CONGRATULATE YOU.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.375
- FOR?

35:03.375 --> 35:07.250
- FOR BECOMING A BIG SHOT
ON LOCAL TV NEWS, OF COURSE.

35:07.250 --> 35:10.709
HOW VERY BRAVE OF YOU TO PUT
YOURSELF OUT THERE LIKE THAT.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.750
- THANKS.

35:15.041 --> 35:17.291
- OH, AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE NAYSAYERS.

35:17.291 --> 35:19.083
THAT GUY MARV ON THE MEDIA--

35:19.083 --> 35:23.208
HE DOESN'T KNOW TALENT
WHEN HE SEES IT.

35:33.959 --> 35:34.959
- FRANNY!

35:34.959 --> 35:37.959
- I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE.

35:39.333 --> 35:41.375
- [sighs]

35:41.375 --> 35:43.375
[grunts]

35:59.417 --> 36:01.000
- IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING
THE BATTLE

36:01.000 --> 36:02.458
OF THE LOCAL WEATHER WOMEN,

36:02.458 --> 36:06.417
KPPQ AND KQMI
ARE CONTINUING THE CATWALK...

36:06.417 --> 36:07.709
- OH, LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF.

36:07.709 --> 36:09.542
DID WE HIT THE LOTTERY?
- HARDLY.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.500
BUT IT IS NICE TO HAVE
SOME ACTUAL MONEY COMING IN.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.041
- YOU ABSOLUTELY ROCK.
- [laughs]

36:14.041 --> 36:15.875
- ARE WE STILL ON
FOR OUR SHOOT TOMORROW?

36:15.875 --> 36:17.000
- OH.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.291
- DON'T TELL ME
YOU FORGOT.

36:18.291 --> 36:20.583
- NO, NO, NO.
JUST--WHAT TIME IS IT AGAIN?

36:20.583 --> 36:22.583
I HAVE TO BE AT THE DISC GOLF
TOURNAMENT AT 2:00.

36:22.583 --> 36:24.208
- OH, IT'S NOT UNTIL 4:00.

36:24.208 --> 36:26.083

45:42.000 --> 45:45.166
BESIDES, I NEVER REALLY
HAD A REASON TO SETTLE DOWN.

45:49.834 --> 45:51.917
- OH, THERE'S FRAN.

45:53.458 --> 45:55.625
HEY.

45:55.625 --> 45:57.375
- WHOA.
I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE YOU.

45:57.375 --> 45:59.875
- I GOT A NEW HAIRSTYLE.
- YOU GOT A NEW HEAD.

45:59.875 --> 46:02.041
- [laughs]

46:02.041 --> 46:04.125
UH, HEY, THIS IS QUENTIN.
- QUENTIN?

46:04.125 --> 46:06.041
- THE FAMOUS DOCUMENTARIAN,
I PRESUME.

46:06.041 --> 46:07.667
- CAN YOU WRITE A NOTE TO MY MOM
THAT SAYS THAT?

46:07.667 --> 46:08.875
- WHAT IS
YOUR DOCUMENTARY ABOUT?

46:08.875 --> 46:10.667
- IT FOCUSES
ON THE CURRENT DROUGHT

46:10.667 --> 46:11.834
AND THE LOOMING WATER CRISIS

46:11.834 --> 46:13.125
THAT WE'RE FACING HERE
IN THE SOUTHWEST.

46:13.125 --> 46:15.208
- WOW.

46:15.208 --> 46:18.000
- I WANNA GET A SHOT OF YOU
IN FRONT OF THE DISPLAY,

46:18.000 --> 46:19.083
SO YOU CAN TALK MORE
ABOUT THE WATERSHEDS.

46:19.083 --> 46:20.125
- COOL.
- OKAY.

46:20.125 --> 46:22.208
I HAVE TO GO
AND GET A BOUNCE CARD.

46:22.208 --> 46:25.709
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

46:25.709 --> 46:27.458
- SO WAIT--SO ARE YOU ACTUALLY
IN FRAN'S DOCUMENTARY?

46:27.458 --> 46:28.875
- YEAH. WHY?

46:28.875 --> 46:31.208
- WELL, THE CONTRACT WE HAVE
WITH YOU IS EXCLUSIVE,

46:31.208 --> 46:32.667
SO YOU'RE NOT--
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO

46:32.667 --> 46:34.333
ANY OTHER KIND
OF OUTSIDE MEDIA WORK.

46:34.333 --> 46:36.208
- OH, I DIDN'T
EVEN THINK OF THAT.

46:36.208 --> 46:37.875
- I DON'T THINK ANYONE
WOULD REALLY CARE

46:37.875 --> 46:40.500
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS,
BUT JUST KEEP IT UNDER WRAPS.

46:40.500 --> 46:43.166
- NOTED. YOU DON'T HAVE
TO STICK AROUND, YOU KNOW.

46:43.166 --> 46:44.834
- I'D KIND OF LIKE TO STAY
AND WATCH YOU WORK,

46:44.834 --> 46:47.542
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

46:49.959 --> 46:52.375
- SURE.

46:54.375 --> 46:56.542
- IT'S NICE OF YOU
TO HELP FRAN WITH HER DOC.

46:56.542 --> 46:57.917
- THAT PROJECT
MEANS EVERYTHING TO HER.

46:57.917 --> 47:00.583
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.

47:00.583 --> 47:03.000
- STILL, I MEAN...
I KNOW HOW BUSY YOU ARE.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.500
- WITH EVERYTHING
I HAVE TO DO AT THE STATION

47:05.500 --> 47:06.875
AND THE UNIVERSITY,

47:06.875 --> 47:08.625
THIS IS THE CLOSEST
I'VE GOTTEN TO EATING OUT.

47:08.625 --> 47:11.750
- IT'S NICE TO GET OUT,
THOUGH.

47:11.750 --> 47:14.500
- WE NEED TO ORGANIZE A TOUR
OF SAN DIEGO FOR YOU.

47:14.500 --> 47:16.917
- MM-HMM.
YES.

47:16.917 --> 47:18.667
ABSOLUTELY.
I'M ALL FOR THAT.

47:18.667 --> 47:20.875
NO, SERIOUSLY, I'VE HAD
NO CHANCE TO EXPLORE AT ALL.

47:20.875 --> 47:22.458
EVERY CITY I'VE EVER LIVED IN,

47:22.458 --> 47:24.709
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE REALLY
GOTTEN A CHANCE TO KNOW THEM.

47:24.709 --> 47:27.583
- IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN
FIND WHEN YOU SETTLE DOWN.

47:29.583 --> 47:31.542
- EXCUSE ME.
ARE YOU DEB METCALFE?

47:31.542 --> 47:33.208
- YES.

47:33.208 --> 47:35.083
- I LOVE YOUR
WEATHER BROADCAST.

47:35.083 --> 47:37.208
- OH, THANK YOU!

47:39.625 --> 47:41.959
HOLY COW!

47:45.291 --> 47:47.250
- I'M TELLING YOU,
I KNOW YOU THINK

47:47.250 --> 47:49.709
OF THIS NEWS GIG
AS A PART-TIME THING,

47:49.709 --> 47:51.458
BUT YOU COULD BE HUGE.

47:51.458 --> 47:53.250
- [laughing]
OH, NO WAY!

47:53.250 --> 47:54.667
- NO, I'M DEAD SERIOUS.

47:54.667 --> 47:58.333
I MEAN, YOU SAW THE WAY
THE PEOPLE REACTED TO YOU.

47:58.333 --> 48:00.959
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

48:02.625 --> 48:04.291
- I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

48:12.333 --> 48:14.792
[engine turns]

48:14.792 --> 48:16.583
LUCKY ME, SHE STARTED.

48:16.583 --> 48:19.250
- I WAS KIND OF HOPING
IT WOULDN'T.

48:24.959 --> 48:27.500
- I HAVE A DISSERTATION
TO FINISH.

48:33.125 --> 48:36.041
- I HAD A GREAT TIME
WITH YOU TODAY.

48:36.041 --> 48:38.291
- ME, TOO.

48:41.542 --> 48:43.834
- I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

48:56.041 --> 48:57.709
[guys murmuring]

48:57.709 --> 49:00.125
- YEAH, SHE LOOKS GOOD!

49:00.125 --> 49:02.208
- HI, DEB.
- HI.

49:02.208 --> 49:04.000
[gls murmuring]

49:04.000 --> 49:06.250
- SHE LOOKS GREAT.

49:07.834 --> 49:09.333
- I'M GLAD
THAT YOU'RE FINALLY

49:09.333 --> 49:11.625
STARTING TO SEE HER POTENTIAL.
- OH, SHE'S DIGNIFIED.

49:11.625 --> 49:12.792
SMART, REAL CLASS ACT.

49:12.792 --> 49:16.000
I THINK SHE COULD BRING
BOTH CREDIBILITY

49:16.000 --> 49:18.458
AND NOTORIETY
TO OUR INSTITUTION.

49:18.458 --> 49:20.291
- EXACTLY WHAT I'VE
BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU.

49:20.291 --> 49:21.709
- THE WAY I SEE IT,
IT'S CERTAINLY BETWEEN

49:21.709 --> 49:23.000
HER AND VERA FOR THE FELLOWSHIP.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.667
THIS PRESENTATION
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE

49:25.667 --> 49:27.875
WILL GIVE THEM BOTH
ONE FINAL CHANCE

49:27.875 --> 49:30.375
TO SHOW US
WHAT THEY'VE REALLY GOT.

49:30.375 --> 49:32.333
- DEB WILL BE READY.

49:32.333 --> 49:33.583
- GOOD.

49:33.583 --> 49:36.083
[background chatter]

49:40.083 --> 49:42.166
- AH, ANY TORNADOS
TO REPORT ON TODAY,

49:42.166 --> 49:43.750
MS. METCALFE?
- [laughs]

49:43.750 --> 49:46.333
GOOD MORNING,
DR. CRENSHAW, SIR.

49:46.333 --> 49:47.834
- GOOD MORNING.
PLEASE CALL ME DAVID.

49:47.834 --> 49:49.875
JUST CAME BY TO SAY
HOW IMPRESSED WE ALL WERE

49:49.875 --> 49:51.750
WITH YOUR PERFORMANCE
AT THE KFZA NEWS.

49:51.750 --> 49:53.750
IT WAS LOVELY.
- OH!

49:53.750 --> 49:56.250
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
SIR--DAVID--

49:56.250 --> 49:58.792
SIR--WAIT.
NOT SIR DAVID?

49:58.792 --> 50:00.333
- NO.
- WELL, ACTUALLY,

50:00.333 --> 50:02.750
I DON'T KNOW YOU THAT WELL.
MAYBE YOU HAVE BEEN KNIGHTED.

50:02.750 --> 50:04.166
[both laughing]
- LOVELY.

50:04.166 --> 50:06.041
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

50:08.500 --> 50:10.208
- SO WHERE ARE YOU WITH
YOUR DISSERTATION?

50:10.208 --> 50:12.583
- BEHIND.
- AND HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT

50:12.583 --> 50:15.583
YOUR PRESENTATION?
- IT'S COMING ALONG.

50:15.583 --> 50:19.000
- DEB, YOU'VE COME TOO FAR
TO DROP THE BALL.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.250
- I KNOW.
I'M JUST TRYING TO

50:20.250 --> 50:21.667
KEEP MY HEAD ABOVE WATER.

50:21.667 --> 50:23.417
- YOU HAVE WORKED TOWARD
THIS ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITY

50:23.417 --> 50:25.208
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

50:25.208 --> 50:27.166
YOU NEED TO KNOCK THIS
COMMITTEE PRESENTATION

50:27.166 --> 50:28.542
OUT OF THE PARK.

50:28.542 --> 50:30.291
NOW, I CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU

50:30.291 --> 50:32.041
GET STARTED WITH THAT
IF YOU LIKE.

50:32.041 --> 50:33.792
I'M WIDE OPEN THIS AFTERNOON.

50:33.792 --> 50:35.667
- I CAN'T.

50:35.667 --> 50:38.750
THEY WANT ME AT THE STATION
FOR A PROMO SHOOT.

50:40.625 --> 50:42.625
- WELL, I WANT A DRAFT OF
THAT PRESENTATION SPEECH

50:42.625 --> 50:45.375
ON MY DESK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

50:52.834 --> 50:54.792
- THAT'S GOOD.

50:54.792 --> 50:56.125
- ONE SEC.

50:58.917 --> 51:01.083
- THANK YOU, LADIES.

51:01.083 --> 51:02.458
THANK YOU, APRIL.

51:02.458 --> 51:04.709
I JUST WANNA GET A FEW
WITH GRANT AND DEB ALONE.

51:04.709 --> 51:06.041
THANK YOU.
- I FEEL SO AWKWARD.

51:06.041 --> 51:07.792
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

51:07.792 --> 51:10.291
- I JUST LOVE
HAVING MY PICTURE TAKEN.

51:10.291 --> 51:12.917
- THE CAMERA
LOVES YOU, TOO, GRANT.

51:12.917 --> 51:14.250
- PERFECT.

51:14.250 --> 51:16.375
- YEAH, THAT WAS GOOD.
I LIKE THAT.

51:16.375 --> 51:18.500
- I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE
TURNED HER

51:18.500 --> 51:20.458
INTO A REAL NEWSWOMAN.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.917
HER SHORT-TERM AGREEMENT
IS SET TO EXPIRE SOON.

51:24.917 --> 51:26.250
WE NEED HER TO RESIGN
LONG-TERM.

51:26.250 --> 51:28.625
- WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO?

51:28.625 --> 51:31.333
- YOU SEEM TO HAVE HER...
ATTENTION.

51:31.333 --> 51:33.333
CONVINCE HER.

51:33.333 --> 51:35.166
[cell phone rings]

51:38.709 --> 51:40.458
- HEY, WILLY, WHAT'S UP?

51:40.458 --> 51:42.750
- THAT DOOR IS OPENING UP
FOR YOU HERE REAL SOON.

51:42.750 --> 51:44.208
- WHY, WHAT'S THE SCOOP?

51:44.208 --> 51:45.542
- THE EXECS HERE ARE INTERESTED

51:45.542 --> 51:47.208
IN WHAT YOU'VE DONE
WITH DEB METCALFE.

51:47.208 --> 51:48.583
I TOLD 'EM ALL ABOUT HOW YOU

51:48.583 --> 51:50.625
TURNED THAT DIAMOND IN
THE ROUGH INTO A SHINING STAR.

51:50.625 --> 51:52.041
- WELL, THAT'S NOT
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

51:52.041 --> 51:53.166
- WHO CARES?

51:53.166 --> 51:54.709
NOW MAKE ME
A KILLER PRESENTATION

51:54.709 --> 51:56.250
SO I CAN SELL THIS TO 'EM.

51:56.250 --> 51:58.291
- UH, WAIT, WHAT ARE--
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

51:58.291 --> 52:00.750
- PACKAGE DEAL.
THAT'S HOW I GET YOU BACK IN.

52:00.750 --> 52:02.500
YOU AND METCALFE TOGETHER.

52:02.500 --> 52:03.500
- WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO?

52:03.500 --> 52:05.500
- SHE'D BE CRAZY
TO TURN IT DOWN.

52:05.500 --> 52:07.500
THE PRESTIGE OF NETWORK NEWS,
NEW YORK CITY.

52:07.500 --> 52:09.375
DID I MENTION THE MONEY?
- WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE--

52:09.375 --> 52:10.834
HER CONTRACT HERE
IS ALMOST UP.

52:10.834 --> 52:12.667
KFZA'S ALREADY
PUSHING TO RENEGOTIATE.

52:12.667 --> 52:15.041
- NO PROBLEM.
KFZA'S AN AFFILIATE.

52:15.041 --> 52:17.375
WE CAN BUY OUT HER CONTRACT.
HAVE HER SIGN HERE OR THERE.

52:17.375 --> 52:19.542
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
JUST LOCK HER UP.

52:19.542 --> 52:21.625
- I'LL TRY.
- SELL IT TO HER, QUENTIN.

52:21.625 --> 52:23.333
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

52:23.333 --> 52:24.667
[beep]

52:32.417 --> 52:33.583
- THANK YOU, GRANT.

52:33.583 --> 52:34.875
I WANNA GET
A FEW WITH JUST DEB.

52:34.875 --> 52:36.291
- I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW

52:36.291 --> 52:37.875
IF I CAN DO THIS BY MYSELF.

52:37.875 --> 52:39.667
- TRY PRETENDING YOU'RE ME.

52:39.667 --> 52:42.417
YOU'LL LOVE IT.
- [laughs]

52:42.417 --> 52:45.125
OKAY.

52:45.125 --> 52:47.417
- TELL ME, WHAT ARE THOSE--
THE BIG WHITE,

52:47.417 --> 52:49.792
FLUFFY CLOUDS IN THE SKY?

52:49.792 --> 52:52.291
- CUMULUS.
- CUMULUS?

52:52.291 --> 52:53.875
CUMULUS.

52:53.875 --> 52:56.375
WHAT IS THE AURORA BOREALIS
AGAIN?

52:56.375 --> 52:59.583
- IT IS A NATURAL LIGHT
DISPLAY--

52:59.583 --> 53:01.125
HEY, NOBODY CARES ABOUT THIS.

53:01.125 --> 53:02.875
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
YES, THEY DO, PROFESSOR.

53:02.875 --> 53:05.583
COME ON, JUST TELL US
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW,

53:05.583 --> 53:07.750
AND MAKE IT EXCITING.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

53:10.333 --> 53:11.750
RUN IT BY LEGAL AGAIN,

53:11.750 --> 53:13.875
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT CLEARED.

53:13.875 --> 53:15.625
ALL RIGHT.
UM...

53:15.625 --> 53:16.792
[cell phone rings]

53:16.792 --> 53:18.542
THAT ONE.

53:18.542 --> 53:20.291
DEB, WHAT'S UP?

53:20.291 --> 53:22.750
- CAN YOU COME HELP ME
OUTSIDE WITH ZEPHYR?

53:29.709 --> 53:31.750
- I REALLY LOVE THAT CAR.

53:31.750 --> 53:34.083
- MIGHT BE TIME FOR A NEW ONE.
- I DON'T KNOW.

53:34.083 --> 53:35.959
IT'D BE TOO HARD
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

53:35.959 --> 53:37.917
PLUS, I CAN'T AFFORD IT.

53:39.333 --> 53:42.083
- TV JOB CAN HELP
IN THAT DEPARTMENT.

53:42.083 --> 53:44.458
COME ON.
I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE.

53:51.500 --> 53:53.166
- SO YOU NEVER TOLD ME
YOUR LONG STORY.

53:53.166 --> 53:54.542
- WHAT LONG STORY?

53:54.542 --> 53:57.542
- WELL, ABOUT HOW YOU
LOST YOUR JOB AT THE NETWORK.

53:57.542 --> 54:02.166
- OH, RIGHT.
WELL, UM, I MEAN...

54:02.166 --> 54:04.375
IN A NUTSHELL, UM...

54:04.375 --> 54:06.709
A SCANDALOUS STORY WAS LEAKED
ABOUT A U.S. SENATOR,

54:06.709 --> 54:09.417
AND THEN EVERY STATION
RAN WITH IT.

54:09.417 --> 54:11.625
AND I JUST--I DIDN'T THINK
THE SOURCE WAS CREDIBLE,

54:11.625 --> 54:14.291
SO I REFUSED.
- WHAT HAPPENED?

54:14.291 --> 54:16.667
- IN THE END, THE STORY
WOUND UP NOT BEING TRUE.

54:16.667 --> 54:19.417
- WELL, THEN WHY DID
THEY FIRE YOU?

54:19.417 --> 54:21.458
- SOMETIMES NETWORKS,

54:21.458 --> 54:23.000
THEY LIKE TO HAVE
THEIR AUDIENCE THAT NIGHT

54:23.000 --> 54:24.959
AND THEN JUST ISSUE
A RETRACTION LATER

54:24.959 --> 54:27.750
RATHER THAN ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW, REPORT THE TRUTH.

54:27.750 --> 54:29.041
- WELL, YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

54:29.041 --> 54:32.291
- MM-HMM.
YEAH.

54:32.291 --> 54:33.917
I'VE BEEN PAYING FOR IT
EVER SINCE.

54:33.917 --> 54:35.834
- IT GOT YOU HERE.

54:35.834 --> 54:37.709
- YEAH, I--

54:38.959 --> 54:42.417
I'M REALLY GLAD
I FOLLOWED MY INSTINCTS ON YOU.

54:49.166 --> 54:51.500
- HEY.

54:57.959 --> 55:00.375
- I WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK
WITH FRAN TODAY.

55:02.750 --> 55:04.250
I'M SO SORRY.

55:04.250 --> 55:06.041
DR. HARRIS HAS BEEN ON MY
BACK ABOUT MY DISSERTATION,

55:06.041 --> 55:07.750
AND THEN I HAD
MY PHOTO SHOOT,

55:07.750 --> 55:09.250
AND THEN MY CAR DIED--

55:09.250 --> 55:12.041
- ZEPHYR FINALLY DIED?
- WELL, NOT DIED DIED, I HOPE.

55:12.041 --> 55:14.709
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.
I HAD HER TOWED TO A MECHANIC.

55:14.709 --> 55:17.625
IT'S JUST BEEN
ONE OF THOSE DAYS, YOU KNOW?

55:19.709 --> 55:24.083
I'M SO SORRY
I FORGOT ABOUT OUR SESSION.

55:24.083 --> 55:26.750
CAN WE RESCHEDULE?

55:28.333 --> 55:30.667
- LOOK, I'LL MAKE IT WORK.

55:30.667 --> 55:33.291
I'LL PULL AUDIO CLIPS
FROM OTHER STUFF WE SHOT,

55:33.291 --> 55:35.709
STITCH IT TOGETHER,

55:35.709 --> 55:38.875
FIX IT, AND POST,
AS THEY SAY.

55:51.875 --> 55:54.583
- DID YOU WRITE THIS
IN 15 MINUTES?

55:54.583 --> 55:57.083
BECAUSE THAT--
THAT'S HOW IT READS.

55:57.083 --> 55:58.458
- I CAN REVISE IT.

56:00.959 --> 56:03.125
- THERE'S NO YOU IN HERE.

56:03.125 --> 56:05.875
I MEAN, WHERE--
WHERE'S THE TRUTH?

56:08.125 --> 56:10.709
- THE TRUTH IS...
I'M STRESSED.

56:10.709 --> 56:14.041
- THIS FELLOWSHIP
IS BETWEEN YOU AND VERA.

56:14.041 --> 56:16.458
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE IS GIVING 200%.

56:16.458 --> 56:18.083
WHERE ARE YOU?

56:18.083 --> 56:22.208
- MAYBE VERA'S MORE CUT OUT
FOR THE JOB THAN I AM.

56:22.208 --> 56:25.125
- DO YOU KNOW THAT THERE
ARE OPPORTUNITIES IN LIFE

56:25.125 --> 56:27.125
THAT ONLY COMENCE?

56:27.125 --> 56:30.250
AND YOU EITHER GRAB THEM
WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAVE

56:30.250 --> 56:33.125
OR YOU LET THEM SLIP
THROUGH YOUR FINGERS.

56:37.959 --> 56:41.208
- HOW'THE SPEECH COMING,
WEATHER GIRL?

56:41.208 --> 56:43.208
- VERA, YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL,

56:43.208 --> 56:45.000
AND ALMOST EVERYONE
LIKES YOU.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?
DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO

56:47.000 --> 56:49.417
TRY AND STEP ON ME
ON YOUR ASSENT, TOO?

56:49.417 --> 56:53.625
- I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN...WHAT'S ENOUGH?

57:01.625 --> 57:03.000
[applause]

57:10.834 --> 57:13.583
- WHAT?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

57:13.583 --> 57:15.500
- I'M SO BIG.
- YES, YOU ARE.

57:15.500 --> 57:16.959
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.

57:16.959 --> 57:18.625
- YOU LOOK GORGEOUS
UP THERE, DEB.

57:18.625 --> 57:20.709
- ALMOST AS GORGEOUS AS ME.

57:20.709 --> 57:22.625
- OH, PLEASE.
[crowd chuckles]

57:22.625 --> 57:24.166
[background chatter]

57:25.333 --> 57:26.875
- YOU SURE WENT TO
A LOT OF TROUBLE,

57:26.875 --> 57:29.875
CONSIDERING I'M ON
A SHORT-TERM CONTRACT.

57:33.166 --> 57:36.500
- EVERYBODY HERE LOVES YOU.
THE AUDIENCE LOVES YOU.

57:36.500 --> 57:38.250
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

57:38.250 --> 57:40.250
- IT FEELS PRETTY GOOD.
- MM.

57:40.250 --> 57:41.959
[chuckling]

57:41.959 --> 57:45.041
SO THIS PROBABLY WON'T COME
AS MUCH OF A SURPRISE,

57:45.041 --> 57:47.500
BUT KFZA'S TALKING
ABOUT RESIGNING YOU--

57:47.500 --> 57:49.208
LONG-TERM.

57:49.208 --> 57:50.750
- YEAH?

57:52.709 --> 57:55.709
- DOES THAT MEAN YOU
WOULD ACTUALLY CONSIDER IT?

57:55.709 --> 57:57.917
- WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?
- OH.

58:00.250 --> 58:03.792
WE COULD DO GREAT THINGS
TOGETHER, YOU AND I, DEB.

58:03.792 --> 58:05.083
- LIKE THE SONG SAYS,

58:05.083 --> 58:07.750
WE ARE HAVING A HEAT WAVE.
[cell phone ringing]

58:07.750 --> 58:09.959
THIS WEEK, TEMPERATURES
SHOULD BE IN THE 80s.

58:09.959 --> 58:12.750
A NICE SOUTHWESTERLY SWELL
WILL BE HITTING OUBEACHES,

58:12.750 --> 58:14.250
SO MAKE SURE YOU GET OUT--
- WILLY.

58:14.250 --> 58:16.041
- RUMORS ABOUND, MY FRIEND.

58:16.041 --> 58:17.834
THAT OPEN DOOR
MAY BE CLOSING SOON.

58:17.834 --> 58:19.583
THE EXECS ARE WARMING UP
TO SOMEONE ELSE

58:19.583 --> 58:20.583
TO FILL THAT JOB OPENING.

58:20.583 --> 58:21.792
- CAN YOU BUY ME
SOME MORE TIME?

58:21.792 --> 58:23.375
- I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.

58:23.375 --> 58:25.333
REMEMBER, IT'S YOU
AND METCALFE OR NO DEAL.

58:25.333 --> 58:27.417
- YEAH.
I KNOW, I GOT IT.

58:27.417 --> 58:28.709
[beep]

58:28.709 --> 58:31.667
- I CONSIDER MYSELF
A KIND OF A...DOCUMENTARIAN.

58:31.667 --> 58:32.959
I'M SURE I COULD
LEND SOME INSIGHT.

58:32.959 --> 58:34.750
- I CAN GIVE YOU A ROUGH CUT
IF YOU'D LIKE.

58:34.750 --> 58:36.667
- CAN'T WAIT.
NICE MEETING YOU, FRAN.

58:36.667 --> 58:38.208
- NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

58:38.208 --> 58:40.875
- HEY.
- HEY, THIS PLACE IS SO COOL,

58:40.875 --> 58:42.083
AND GRANT IS SO NICE.

58:42.083 --> 58:43.667
I EVEN GOT A TOUR
AND EVERYTHING.

58:43.667 --> 58:45.250
- I'M SO GLAD YOU GOT TO
COME CHECK OUT THE STUDIO.

58:45.250 --> 58:47.166
- LET'S GO GET SOME PIZZA.
I'M STARVING.

58:47.166 --> 58:49.583
- I WAS GONNA STAY LATE
AND WORK ON SOME SCHOOL STUFF.

58:49.583 --> 58:51.000
- BUT YOU GOTTA EAT
THOUGH, RIGHT?

58:51.000 --> 58:52.959
- YEAH, BUT I HAVE TO
SPEND SOME TIME

58:52.959 --> 58:54.583
IN HAIR AND MAKEUP, TOO.

58:54.583 --> 58:56.542
GRACE AND I ARE GONNA
TRY A COUPLE NEW LOOKS.

58:56.542 --> 58:59.417
- THESE JUST CAME IN FOR YOU.
- OOH!

58:59.417 --> 59:03.750
THIS, I LOVE.
AND, UH, THIS IS GREAT.

59:03.750 --> 59:05.709
MAYBE TOMORROW WE COULD DO

59:05.709 --> 59:07.000
WHAT--

59:07.000 --> 59:09.417
- COME ON.
LET'S TRY THEM ON.

59:09.417 --> 59:11.208
COME ON.

59:11.208 --> 59:12.792
- YEAH, THE RAIN BIT
MAKES ME LAUGH.

59:12.792 --> 59:14.542
THAT'S GOOD, SO WE'LL KEEP
THAT, AND THEN WHAT'S TWO?

59:14.542 --> 59:16.458
YEAH, NOCUT THE BEGINNING.
CUT THE BEGINNING.

59:24.125 --> 59:26.959
UH...KEEP GOING.
FAST FORWARD THROUGH THIS PART.

59:26.959 --> 59:29.000
YEAH, YEAH.
SO CUT THAT OUT.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.583
I DON'T LIKE THAT.
UM, BUT THEN USE THIS.

59:31.583 --> 59:33.417
USE THE END.
[beep, click]

59:35.583 --> 59:37.166
- HEY.
- YEAH, HEY.

59:37.166 --> 59:38.709
WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING HERE?

59:38.709 --> 59:40.041
- WORKING ON MY SPEECH.

59:40.041 --> 59:41.959
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- COULD BE BETTER.

59:41.959 --> 59:44.000
- OH, HERE.
MAY I?

59:46.166 --> 59:47.750
I MEAN, YOU GOT ALL THE FACTS
HERE BUT...

59:47.750 --> 59:49.959
- WHAT?
- WHERE'S YOUR VOICE HERE?

59:49.959 --> 59:51.208
I MEAN, THIS...

59:51.208 --> 59:53.250
THIS KINDA OF READS
LIKE A SCIENCE TEXTBOOK.

59:53.250 --> 59:55.125
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

59:55.125 --> 59:57.166
I'M REALLY STRUGGLING
WITH IT FOR SOME REASON.

59:57.166 --> 59:58.583
- YOU JUST NEED TO CHANNEL
THE PERSON

59:58.583 --> 01:00:00.041
THAT BLEW OFF MY DIRECTIONS

01:00:00.041 --> 01:00:02.083
AND TOLD HER AUDIENCE THEY
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR

01:00:02.083 --> 01:00:03.417
FROM A LITTLE OLD TORNADO.

01:00:03.417 --> 01:00:04.583
- WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?

01:00:04.583 --> 01:00:07.834
- I HAVE A POTENTIAL
NEW YORK JOB THING.

01:00:07.834 --> 01:00:11.750
- OH.
BACK TO NEW YORK?

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:14.041
- WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY...
- WHAT?

01:00:17.792 --> 01:00:20.291
- NOTHING.
UM, NOTHING.

01:00:20.291 --> 01:00:22.750
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:25.625
- NO, BUT THE CRAZY THING IS--

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:27.667
I MEAN, I GREW UP IN SAN DIEGO
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:29.959
AND I NEVER
HAD TO BRANCH OUT,

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.792
NEVER HAD TO CHANGE.

01:00:31.792 --> 01:00:34.959
- WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:00:34.959 --> 01:00:36.792
- WHERE WOULD I LIVE?

01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:39.291
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:00:39.291 --> 01:00:41.041
NEW YORK?

01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:43.458
WHAT?

01:00:43.458 --> 01:00:45.792
I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE
SHOULD LIVE IN NEW YORK

01:00:45.792 --> 01:00:47.792
AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIVES.

01:00:47.792 --> 01:00:49.625
LOOK, THE WORLD'S ALWAYS
CHANGING--YOU CAN'T FIGHT IT.

01:00:49.625 --> 01:00:51.667
YOU GOT TO CHANGE WITHIN,
OR YOU GET LEFT BEHIND.

01:00:51.667 --> 01:00:53.500
- MM-MM.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.625
NO, SEE, WHEN EVERYTHING
AROUND ME IS CHANGING,

01:00:56.625 --> 01:00:59.166
IT GIVES ME COMFORT

01:00:59.166 --> 01:01:01.250
TO THINK THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT
PARTS OF OURSELVES,

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:03.750
THE TRUEST PARTS--

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:06.083
THEY NEVER CHANGE.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:12.625
- IF I COULD CHANGE ONE THING
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW...

01:01:12.625 --> 01:01:14.208
- WHAT?

01:01:17.417 --> 01:01:20.542
- I WISH I COULD FIND US
A SHOOTING STAR.

01:01:28.917 --> 01:01:32.917
- HEY, YOU KNOW THAT FEELING
I HAD ABOUT YOU?

01:01:32.917 --> 01:01:35.959
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH OUR WORKING RELATIONSHIP.

01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:56.458
- DEB.
- [gasps]

01:01:56.458 --> 01:01:58.417
YOU SCARED ME.
- [chuckles]

01:01:58.417 --> 01:01:59.792
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:01:59.792 --> 01:02:02.834
LOOKING AT CARS?
I THOUGHT YOU GOT ZEPHYR FIXED.

01:02:02.834 --> 01:02:04.250
- I DID.

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:07.250
I WAS JUST THINKING MAYBE
IT'S TIME TO RETIRE HER.

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:09.250
- DR. HARRIS LEFT YOU,
LIKE, THREE MESSAGES HERE.

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:10.583
- [sighs]
I KNOW.

01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:12.583
SHE HAS LEFT MESSAGES
ON MY CELL PHONE TOO.

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:16.291
- YOUR PRESENTATION'S, LIKE,
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

01:02:19.291 --> 01:02:21.458
- MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT
IN THE CARDS FOR ME.

01:02:21.458 --> 01:02:24.500
- YOU'VE WORKED
YOUR WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.291
AND YOU GO
AND CHANGE YOUR HAIR

01:02:26.291 --> 01:02:29.125
AND PUT ON A LITTLE MAKEUP
AND GET SOME ATTENTION,

01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:32.375
AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA
THROW IT ALL AWAY?

01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:44.625
[door closes]

01:02:45.667 --> 01:02:48.667
[indistinct chatter]

01:02:56.166 --> 01:02:58.667
- HEY. OH.

01:02:58.667 --> 01:03:01.041
YOU ALL RIGHT?
[door opens]

01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:04.750
HEY.

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:06.917
- [sighs]
FRAN AND I HAD A FIGHT.

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:10.583
NOT LIKE A FIGHT FIGHT,
BUT WHATEVER.

01:03:10.583 --> 01:03:13.083
- WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?
- ME.

01:03:13.083 --> 01:03:15.375
SHE THINKS I'M GIVING UP
ON THE FELLOWSHIP.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.583
SHE THINKS I'VE CHANGED,
NOT FOR THE BETTER.

01:03:17.583 --> 01:03:19.583
- HAVE YOU CHANGED?

01:03:21.917 --> 01:03:23.750
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:27.375
- I DIDN'T THINK YOU NEEDED
TO GIVE YOURSELF A MAKEOVER.

01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:29.250
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL BEFORE.

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:32.250
YOU JUST DIDN'T REALIZE IT.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:36.583
I THINK THAT WHAT YOU TOLD ME
THE OTHER NIGHT IS TRUE--

01:03:36.583 --> 01:03:40.750
THAT THE TRUEST PART
OF OURSELVES NEVER CHANGES.

01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:44.625
YOU'RE GONNA BE FANTASTIC
IN WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO,

01:03:44.625 --> 01:03:45.792
DEB METCALFE.

01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:48.625
[chuckles]

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:51.458
- WE'LL SEE
IF THAT'S TRUE TOMORROW.

01:03:51.458 --> 01:03:53.583
- YOUR SPEECH--
ARE YOU PREPARED?

01:03:53.583 --> 01:03:56.250
- [chuckles]
NOT AT ALL,

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:58.458
BUT I STILL HAVE TONIGHT
TO WORK ON IT.

01:03:58.458 --> 01:04:01.083
- DOWN TO THE WIRE.

01:04:01.083 --> 01:04:02.500
- HEY, QUENTIN?

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.083
I WOULD LOVE
FOR YOU TO BE THERE.

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:11.625
- I WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD.

01:04:22.208 --> 01:04:25.208
[keys clacking]

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:34.792
- [sighs]

01:04:34.792 --> 01:04:37.458
[thunder rumbles]

01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:39.834
[key clacking rapidly]

01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:45.333
[sighs]

01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:51.125
[thunder booms]

01:05:04.083 --> 01:05:08.083
[rain falling]

01:05:23.291 --> 01:05:25.083
- I'M STARING AT THE PLACE
WHERE, IN AN HOUR,

01:05:25.083 --> 01:05:27.375
I'LL BE GIVING THE SPEECH THAT
DETERMINES THE REST OF MY LIFE.

01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:29.000
- THAT'S A GREAT SELF-PEP TALK.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.291
- OKAY, YOU TRY.

01:05:31.291 --> 01:05:33.083
- LISTEN TO ME.
YOU'RE ARTICULATE.

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:34.625
YOU'RE AMUSING.
YOU GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

01:05:34.625 --> 01:05:35.959
- YEAH, EXCEPT A ROOM FULL

01:05:35.959 --> 01:05:37.750
OF HIGHBROW ACADEMICS
JUDGING ME.

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:40.083
- HEY, FIND ME IN THE AUDIENCE.
TELL IT TO ME.

01:05:40.083 --> 01:05:42.291
YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.
- ARE YOU GONNA BE HERE ON?

01:05:42.291 --> 01:05:43.917
- YEP.
I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW.

01:05:43.917 --> 01:05:45.625
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:46.792
[cell phone beeps]

01:05:46.792 --> 01:05:49.458
[telephone ringing]

01:05:49.458 --> 01:05:51.125
YEAH.

01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:53.458
ALL RIGHT, PUT HIM ON.

01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:55.083
HEY, UH, WILLY,
UH, CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:56.208
I'M RUNNING LATE RIGHT NOW.

01:05:56.208 --> 01:05:58.125
- WE GOT YOU

01:05:58.125 --> 01:05:59.625
YOU'RE WITH THE CFO,

AND THE GENERAL MANAGER.

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:04.583
- YEAH, SURE.
GO AHEAD.

01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:07.542
- IF YOU WAN TO BE
ON THE CUTTING EDGE,

01:06:07.542 --> 01:06:09.625
YOU HAVE TO KEEP
YOUR TOOLS SHARP.

01:06:09.625 --> 01:06:14.208
AND THOSE WIELDING THE BLADE
BETTER KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

01:06:14.208 --> 01:06:17.000
I AM HONORED
TO HAVE STUDIED HERE

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.583
AND HOPE TO CONTINUE MY WORK
FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:22.959
THANK YOU.

01:06:30.083 --> 01:06:31.875
- THANK YOU, VERA.

01:06:31.875 --> 01:06:33.417
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A SHORT BREAK

01:06:33.417 --> 01:06:36.417
AND COME BACK WITH OUR

[door opens]

01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:57.166
[door closes]

01:06:57.166 --> 01:06:59.500
- NICE JOB
ON YOUR SPEECH, VERA.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.041
- I THOUGHT IT WENT WELL,

01:07:02.041 --> 01:07:05.959
BUT THEN AGAIN, I WAS MADE
FOR THIS TYPE OF THING.

01:07:05.959 --> 01:07:07.750
YOU ACTUALLY SURPRISED ME

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:10.583
HOW WELL YOU WERE ABLE
TO STEP IT UP.

01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:13.250
YOU REALLY ARE LEARNING
HOW TO PLAY THE GAME.

01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:15.250
GOOD LUCK, WEATHER GIRL.

01:07:18.417 --> 01:07:22.083
[door opens]

01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:23.959
[door closes]

01:07:59.625 --> 01:08:00.792
- [sighs]

01:08:09.709 --> 01:08:11.875
[clears throat]

01:08:30.082 --> 01:08:32.082
I HAD A SPEECH PREPARED,

01:08:32.082 --> 01:08:34.582
BUT I WAS HAVING
A REALLY HARD TIME WITH IT

01:08:34.582 --> 01:08:37.709
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT HAD TO BE PERFECT.

01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:41.917
BUT IT'S JUST OCCURRED
TO ME...

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.582
THAT I'M NOT
THE RIGHT CANDIDATE

01:08:43.582 --> 01:08:46.417
FOR THIS FELLOWSHIP
BECAUSE I'M PERFECT.

01:08:46.417 --> 01:08:50.125
I'M THE RIGHT CANDIDATE
FOR THIS FELLOWSHIP

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:53.792
BECAUSE I HAVE LOVED METEOROLOGY
SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

01:08:55.792 --> 01:08:59.250
IT HAS BEEN MY FOCUS
FOR MOST OF MY LIFE.

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:01.375
AND WITH YOUR HELP,

01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:03.542
I CAN CONTINUE TO BRING
THAT FOCUS

01:09:03.542 --> 01:09:06.375
TO THIS UNIVERSITY.

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.709
I GOT DISTRACTED

01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:11.250
BY THE ATTENTION AND PRAISE
THAT I RECEIVED

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:13.250
BECAUSE I WAS ON TV.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.582
BUT I TOOK THAT JOB
IN THE FIRST PLACE

01:09:15.582 --> 01:09:18.082
BECAUSE IT PROVIDED ME
WITH AN OPPORTUNITY

01:09:18.082 --> 01:09:19.709
OUTSIDE OF THIS UNIVERSITY

01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:23.000
TO EDUCATE PEOPLE
ABOUT THE WEATHER.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.917
I CONSIDER IT A PRIVILEGE

01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:30.082
TO BE ABLE TO SHARE
MY KNOWLEDGE

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:34.667
AND CONTINUE THIS INSPIRATION
THROUGH MY WORK.

01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:37.375
I JUST WANT TO CONTINUE
DOING THAT HERE.

01:09:52.582 --> 01:09:55.583
[indistinct chatter]

01:09:58.125 --> 01:10:00.959
- YOU THINK I DID OKAY?
- DEB, YOU NAILED IT.

01:10:00.959 --> 01:10:03.792
IT WAS SO AMAZING,
AND IT WAS FROM YOUR HEART.

01:10:03.792 --> 01:10:05.458
- SO THAT REMINDS ME--

01:10:05.458 --> 01:10:08.083
OH, DEAR, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:10:08.083 --> 01:10:09.291
WHAT ABOUT YOUR--

01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:10.417
BUT SHE'S--

01:10:10.417 --> 01:10:12.291
- I GUESS DR. HARRIS
DIDN'T THINK SO.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:14.625
[door opens]
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:10:14.625 --> 01:10:16.709
- LOOKS LIKE
IT'S GONNA BE VERA.

01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:18.959
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

01:10:21.542 --> 01:10:25.000
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.

01:10:26.834 --> 01:10:30.625
I HAD TO TAKE A PHONE CALL.

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:32.625
- I'LL LEAVE YOU GUYS TO IT.

01:10:32.625 --> 01:10:35.166
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

01:10:35.166 --> 01:10:37.166
- I'M...

01:10:39.667 --> 01:10:41.667
[sighs]

01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:43.333
HOW DID IT GO?

01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:45.375
- I DON'T THINK
I GOT THE FELLOWSHIP.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:49.000
- I AM SO SORRY.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.458
LOOK, MAYBE IT WILL HELP.

01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:53.291
THE PHONE CALL
I REALLY HAD TO TAKE--

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:55.792
NEW YORK WANTS BOTH OF US.

01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:01.417
- WAIT. WHAT?

01:11:01.417 --> 01:11:02.917
IS THAT WHY YOU GAVE ME
THAT SPEECH

01:11:02.917 --> 01:11:04.917
ABOUT HOW EVERYONE SHOULD LIVE
IN NEW YORK

01:11:04.917 --> 01:11:06.750
ONCE IN THEIR LIFE?

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:09.583
- NO.
I MEANT THAT.

01:11:09.583 --> 01:11:12.709
I MEAN, IT'S NEW YORK.

01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:16.583
I MEAN, BOTH OF US TOGETHER,
OUR DREAM JOB.

01:11:16.583 --> 01:11:19.291
- YOUR DREAM, NOT MINE.

01:11:21.125 --> 01:11:23.458
- I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T PLAN THIS.

01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:27.792
BUT THAT'S--THAT'S ONE HECK
OF A CONSOLATION PRIZE.

01:11:31.917 --> 01:11:34.959
- I MEAN, YOU'RE USED TO JUMPING
AROUND FROM CITY TO CITY,

01:11:34.959 --> 01:11:37.333
SO YOU--YOU JUST GO.

01:11:37.333 --> 01:11:39.458
I LIVE HERE.

01:11:39.458 --> 01:11:41.291
- WELL, NO, IF YOU DON'T GO
TO NEW YORK,

01:11:41.291 --> 01:11:43.458
I'M NOT GOING TO NEW YORK.

01:11:47.625 --> 01:11:49.125
- YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

01:11:51.625 --> 01:11:54.458
- I DON'T--I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTOOD ME.

01:11:56.166 --> 01:11:57.959
IT'S YOU AND ME TOGETHER.

01:11:57.959 --> 01:11:59.917
THAT'S--THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT.

01:11:59.917 --> 01:12:02.458
THAT'S THE PACKAGE.

01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:04.083
- [gasps]

01:12:04.083 --> 01:12:06.542
HAVE YOU BEEN SHOPPING ME AROUND
THIS ENTIRE TIME?

01:12:06.542 --> 01:12:08.417
- NO--

01:12:08.417 --> 01:12:11.375
DEB, NO.

01:12:11.375 --> 01:12:13.250
- IS THAT ALL THERE WAS
BETWEEN US?

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:14.500
IS IT--WAS THAT IT?

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.417
- NO.

01:12:16.417 --> 01:12:17.917
NO, THAT WASN'T.

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:20.667
I NEVER LIED TO YOU
ABOUT ANYTHING.

01:12:23.917 --> 01:12:26.583
- YOU JUST DIDN'T REVEAL
THE DETAILS OF THE STORY.

01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:45.291
- YEAH, LET'S JUST KEEP
THAT PACE CLIPPING ALONG TODAY.

01:12:45.291 --> 01:12:47.959
GRANT, I LOVE YOU.
NOT AS MUCH AD-LIBBING.

01:12:47.959 --> 01:12:49.792
- GONNA GET ANGRY LETTERS,
BUT OKAY.

01:12:49.792 --> 01:12:51.000
[laughter]

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.792
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON,
LET'S GET TO IT.

01:12:52.792 --> 01:12:57.458
[indistinct chatter]

01:12:57.458 --> 01:12:58.625
- ALL RIGHT, SO I WAS THINKING,

01:12:58.625 --> 01:12:59.917
HOW ABOUT WE MIX IT UP
A LITTLE BIT

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.291
AND SHOOT A WEATHER SEGMENT
FROM THE ROOF TOMORROW?

01:13:01.291 --> 01:13:04.166
THERE'S GREAT VIEW UP THERE.

01:13:04.166 --> 01:13:06.417
- LET'S JUST STICK TO THE SET,
HUH?

01:13:13.834 --> 01:13:15.792
- LITTLE CHILLY
WITH THE WEATHERGIRL?

01:13:15.792 --> 01:13:17.333
- OH, THAT WAS NOTHING.

01:13:17.333 --> 01:13:20.125
- OH, GREAT.
SO SHE'LL RENEW HER CONTRACT.

01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:21.834
- LOOK, I THINK WE NEED
TO MOVE ON.

01:13:28.333 --> 01:13:31.166
- NO, IT REALLY IS QUITE GOOD.

01:13:31.166 --> 01:13:33.333
I-I THINK WITH THE CHANGES
THAT I'VE OUTLINED,

01:13:33.333 --> 01:13:34.667
IT COULD EVEN BE GREAT.

01:13:34.667 --> 01:13:35.750
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:36.959
- SO GLAD YOU LIKED IT.

01:13:36.959 --> 01:13:39.125
- JOSH, YOU SHOULD WATCH
FRAN'S DOCUMENTARY.

01:13:39.125 --> 01:13:41.834
THIS YOUNG LADY IS QUITE
THE FILM MAKER.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.041
- YEAH, SURE.

01:13:43.041 --> 01:13:45.375
- DEB'S IN IT.

01:13:45.375 --> 01:13:46.750
- DEB?

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:51.208
LOVE TO TAKE A LOOK.

01:13:51.208 --> 01:13:54.625
THANK YOU.

01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:56.333
[phone chimes]

01:13:56.333 --> 01:14:00.000
[indistinct chatter]

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.542
- OH.

01:14:01.542 --> 01:14:03.667
"COME SEE ME."

01:14:03.667 --> 01:14:06.333
MAKE IT OFFICIAL, I SUPPOSE.

01:14:06.333 --> 01:14:08.750
- A WORD?

01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:10.542
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A MINUTE
AND LOOK THIS OVER?

01:14:10.542 --> 01:14:11.750
- WHAT IS IT?

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:13.250
- YOUR NEW CONTRACT.

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:15.208
YOUR SHORT-TERM'S ALMOST UP
AND WE'RE ALL EAGER

01:14:15.208 --> 01:14:16.542
TO HAVE YOU RE-SIGN.

01:14:16.542 --> 01:14:17.875
- I KNOW IT SEEMS STRANGE,
BUT I STILL

01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:19.959
WANT TO BE AN ACADEMIC.

01:14:19.959 --> 01:14:22.250
- IT'S A VERY GENEROUS OFFER.

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:24.500
AT LEAST LOOK AT IT.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:31.750
IMPRESSED?

01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:34.709
- YES.

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:36.750
AND I APPRECIATE IT, I DO,

01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:38.375
BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED.

01:14:38.375 --> 01:14:40.917
I WANT TO STAY IN ACADEMIA.

01:14:40.917 --> 01:14:42.667
I GOT TO RUN
TO THE UNIVERSITY.

01:14:42.667 --> 01:14:44.917
I'LL BE BACK LATER.
- MM-HMM.

01:14:49.083 --> 01:14:50.834
OKAY.

01:14:50.834 --> 01:14:52.792
WE'LL TRY THIS ANOTHER WAY.

01:14:56.083 --> 01:14:58.625
I WANT LEGAL IN MY OFFICE
IN TEN MINUTES.

01:14:58.625 --> 01:15:01.625
I HAVE A CONTRACT ISSUE.

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:08.750
[phone rings]

01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:11.625
- HEY, DEB.

01:15:23.583 --> 01:15:27.291
- DEB, COME ON IN.

01:15:27.291 --> 01:15:30.083
LISTEN, I AM REALLY SORRY THAT
I HAD TO RUSH OUT YESTERDAY.

01:15:30.083 --> 01:15:31.458
I HAD A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

01:15:31.458 --> 01:15:33.375
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:15:33.375 --> 01:15:35.834
- NO, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

01:15:35.834 --> 01:15:38.500
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY
I BROUGHT YOU IN TODAY.

01:15:41.792 --> 01:15:44.291
YOU GOT THE FELLOWSHIP.

01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:47.667
[uplifting orchestral flourish]

01:15:47.667 --> 01:15:49.375
- WHAT?

01:15:49.375 --> 01:15:51.792
- THEY ANNOUNCED IT
THIS MORNING.

01:15:51.792 --> 01:15:54.625
- I GOT IT?
- YES. [laughs]

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:56.375
- I GOT IT?
- YES!

01:15:56.375 --> 01:15:58.083
[laughter]

01:15:58.083 --> 01:16:01.041
CONGRATULATIONS!

01:16:01.041 --> 01:16:04.208
- WOW!
WHA--

01:16:04.208 --> 01:16:05.500
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.000
- NO!
WHY WOULD I KID WITH YOU?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.500
LOOK AT ALL THIS HARD WORK
THAT YOU DID.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.625
I MEAN IT.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

01:16:11.625 --> 01:16:12.667
- OH!

01:16:12.667 --> 01:16:16.250
- I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:19.834
- WOW.

01:16:19.834 --> 01:16:21.291
SOFT BREEZES PROVIDE
AN OPPORTUNITY

01:16:21.291 --> 01:16:23.208
TO PLAY WITH THE WEATHER
THIS WEEK.

01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:25.458
SO, HEY, GO FLY A KITE.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.583
- I THINK SHE'S TALKING TO YOU.

01:16:30.583 --> 01:16:31.834
- GO TO GRANT NOW.

01:16:31.834 --> 01:16:33.250
- THANKS, DEB.

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:35.291
AND WHEN WE COME BACK,
THE GRUNION ARE RUNNING...

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:37.583
- BET YOU ASSUMED BECAUSE YOU
COULDN'T GET DEB TO RE-SIGN,

01:16:37.583 --> 01:16:39.250
IT WAS A DONE DEAL.

01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:40.583
- THEY OFFERED HER
THE FELLOWSHIP.

01:16:40.583 --> 01:16:41.709
IT'S OVER.

01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:44.750
- WE'LL SEE.

01:16:51.333 --> 01:16:53.333
- HEY, DEB.

01:16:59.709 --> 01:17:02.709
I WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE FELLOWSHIP.

01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:04.000
- THANKS.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.542
- OF COURSE I HAD A FEW
CLINGING HOPES.

01:17:05.542 --> 01:17:07.333
- DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT.

01:17:07.333 --> 01:17:09.041
- [sighs]
LOOK.

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:14.083
I KNOW THIS SEEMS LIKE A SHAM,
BUT IT WASN'T.

01:17:14.083 --> 01:17:15.583
I'M SO SORRY
IF YOU THINK THAT--

01:17:15.583 --> 01:17:17.291
- YOU KNOW WHAT, QUENTIN?

01:17:17.291 --> 01:17:18.333
IT'S BEEN A LONG COUPLE DAYS.

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:21.166
I'M JUST GONNA SAY GOOD NIGHT.

01:17:21.166 --> 01:17:24.291
[engine stutters and turns over]

01:17:26.834 --> 01:17:28.458
- I WAS KIND OF HOPING
IT WOULDN'T START.

01:17:57.375 --> 01:17:59.250
- GET AN EARLY START
ON TOMORROW'S BOARD?

01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:01.208
- YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:18:01.208 --> 01:18:04.458
- HOW ABOUT THIS FOR A SEGMENT?

01:18:19.959 --> 01:18:22.792
- I'M NOT SURE...

01:18:22.792 --> 01:18:25.625
HOW MUCH
YOU THINK YOU KNOW.

01:18:25.625 --> 01:18:27.250
- YOU DON'T LAST AS LONG
IN THIS BUSINESS

01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:29.333
AS I HAVE ON PERSONALITY ALONE.

01:18:29.333 --> 01:18:31.875
- [laughs]

01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:33.458
SO YOU KNOW ABOUT ME AND DEB?

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:37.083
- I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND DEB
AND THE NEW YORK OFFER.

01:18:37.083 --> 01:18:39.709
YOUR FRIEND WILLY LIKES TO
BOAST TO HIS FRIENDS.

01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:42.375

30 YEARS, QUENTIN.

HERE'S MY ADVICE TO YOU.

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:10.250
BEING SORRY ISN'T ENOUGH.

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:12.750
A WOMAN NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT SHE CAN COUNT ON YOU.

01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:18.750
SHOULD DEB EVER BE ABLE
TO TRUST YOU AGAIN?

01:19:21.333 --> 01:19:23.959
IF SO, YOU NEED TO SHOW HER.

NO.

SHE'S LEAVING
WHEN HER CONTRACT IS UP.

01:20:45.917 --> 01:20:47.250
I ALREADY CONFIRMED THAT.
WHY?

STARRING DEB.

01:21:14.458 --> 01:21:16.500
AND I CAN MAKE EVERYTHING OKAY
IF DEB JUST AGREES

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.709
TO EXTEND
HER EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT.

01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:22.250

AT THE COST OF LOSING
THE BEST THING

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.834

- WELL, MAYBE THIS IS ONE THING
YOU CAN'T FIX.

TO WARN HER

BESIDES, YOU CAN'T FIRE ME

01:24:08.667 --> 01:24:11.458
WITHOUT APPROVAL
FROM THE UPSTAIRS.

[door slams]

01:24:22.208 --> 01:24:24.208
- WHAT ABOUT NEW YORK?

01:24:28.667 --> 01:24:30.583

TO OFFER ME.

I SAW THAT ONE.
- FINALLY.
