01:38.293 --> 01:40.587
I told you to stay off the boardwalk.

01:46.050 --> 01:47.635
Okay, boys, let's go.

01:56.895 --> 01:59.564
You, too, off the boardwalk.

03:18.017 --> 03:19.102
<i>Keep going.</i>

03:19.185 --> 03:20.937
<i>Hey, I liked that song.</i>

03:21.437 --> 03:22.897
<i>Keep going, Mom.</i>

03:23.648 --> 03:24.941
- <i>How about this?</i>
- <i>Hang on.</i>

03:25.024 --> 03:27.527
<i>I don't see any bogeymen or nasty guys.</i>

03:30.822 --> 03:33.491
<i>Keep going. You want to switch the band?</i>

03:46.129 --> 03:49.174
- Keep going!
- Wait. That's from my era!

03:57.557 --> 03:59.100
We're almost there.

03:59.267 --> 04:00.977
What's that smell?

04:01.227 --> 04:02.937
That's the ocean air.

04:03.062 --> 04:04.814
Smells like someone died.

04:06.149 --> 04:08.109
Guys, I know the last year
hasn't been easy, but...

04:08.193 --> 04:11.696
...I think you're really going to like
living in Santa Carla.

04:54.197 --> 04:56.366
There's an amusement park
right on the beach.

04:56.449 --> 04:59.119
Sam, tell those kids
to get something to eat.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.246
Any jobs around here?

05:01.329 --> 05:02.831
Nothing legal.

06:35.757 --> 06:37.217
Come on, Nanook.

06:58.947 --> 06:59.948
Dad?

07:00.907 --> 07:01.908
Dad?

07:02.325 --> 07:03.493
Looks like he's dead.

07:03.576 --> 07:05.495
No, he's just a deep sleeper.

07:05.703 --> 07:08.206
If he's dead, can we go back to Phoenix?

07:08.915 --> 07:10.250
Playing dead...

07:10.333 --> 07:13.670
...and from what I heard,
doing a damn good job of it, too.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.639
This is a pretty cool place.

07:24.722 --> 07:26.850
For <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>.

07:26.933 --> 07:28.935
Come on, Sam, give Mom a break.

07:29.352 --> 07:31.354
What's wrong with this picture?

07:31.437 --> 07:35.608
There's no TV. Have you seen a TV?
I haven't seen a TV.

07:35.859 --> 07:38.820
You know what it means
when there's no TV? No MTV.

07:38.903 --> 07:40.905
Sammy, we are flat broke.

07:44.492 --> 07:47.120
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew...

07:47.203 --> 07:50.415
...who didn't improve her situation
by getting divorced.

07:50.874 --> 07:52.083
I know.

07:53.084 --> 07:56.796
But a big legal war wasn't going
to improve anybody's situation.

07:57.630 --> 07:59.841
We've all been through enough.

08:00.592 --> 08:02.886
Anyway, I was raised better than that.

08:02.969 --> 08:04.846
Ouch, my hair.

08:07.348 --> 08:09.058
Mom, you gotta help me.

08:10.602 --> 08:13.188
Hey, guys, no running in the house!

08:21.488 --> 08:23.990
Talk about <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>.

08:25.492 --> 08:26.826
Rules!

08:27.327 --> 08:30.163
We've got some rules around here.

08:30.663 --> 08:32.707
Second shelf is mine.

08:32.791 --> 08:36.836
That's where I keep my root beers
and my double-thick Oreo cookies.

08:37.212 --> 08:40.089
Nobody touches the second shelf, but me.

08:41.716 --> 08:44.761
There's another rule around here,
and I want you to pay close attention.

08:44.844 --> 08:46.846
Don't touch anything.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.932
Everything is exactly where I want it.

08:49.015 --> 08:50.016
Grandpa...

08:50.099 --> 08:53.770
...is it true that Santa Carla's
the murder capital of the world?

08:54.270 --> 08:56.397
There are some bad elements around here.

08:56.481 --> 08:58.107
Wait, let me get this straight.

08:58.191 --> 09:00.902
You're telling me we've moved
to the murder capital of the world?

09:00.985 --> 09:02.320
Are you serious, Grandpa?

09:02.403 --> 09:04.113
Well, let me put it this way.

09:04.197 --> 09:08.118
If all the corpses buried around here
were to stand up all at once...

09:08.201 --> 09:10.912
...we'd have one hell
of a population problem.

09:12.372 --> 09:13.581
Great, Dad.

09:13.748 --> 09:15.416
Now, on Wednesdays...

09:15.500 --> 09:17.961
...when the mailman brings the <i>TV Guide</i>...

09:18.044 --> 09:21.339
...sometimes the address label
is curled up just a little.

09:21.506 --> 09:24.008
You'll be tempted to tear it off. Don't.

09:24.551 --> 09:28.012
You'll only wind up rippin' the cover
and I don't like that.

09:28.221 --> 09:29.722
And stay outta here.

09:31.141 --> 09:32.642
- You have a TV?
- No.

09:32.892 --> 09:35.061
I just like to read the <i>TV Guide</i>.

09:35.270 --> 09:38.106
If you read the <i>TV Guide</i>,
you don't need a TV.

11:53.533 --> 11:55.201
I can't find my mom.

11:57.245 --> 11:58.705
What's the matter?

12:01.875 --> 12:03.209
Are you lost?

12:12.385 --> 12:13.803
Let's ask in here.

12:13.887 --> 12:16.014
Excuse me, I wonder if you could help us.

12:16.097 --> 12:19.350
This boy is lost and we're wondering
if his mother might be in here.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.935
I don't really know.

12:22.937 --> 12:24.397
I was so worried!

12:25.148 --> 12:26.441
Don't run off like that.

12:26.524 --> 12:27.484
There you are.

12:27.567 --> 12:28.818
Thank you.

12:28.902 --> 12:30.320
Bye, Terry.

12:31.070 --> 12:33.406
We only come here to watch one thing.

12:35.366 --> 12:36.409
Well done.

12:36.493 --> 12:37.619
No, thanks.

12:37.702 --> 12:40.038
Well, on second thought...

12:41.414 --> 12:43.792
I told you not to come in here anymore.

12:53.843 --> 12:55.094
Wild kids.

12:55.303 --> 12:58.431
Oh, they're just young.
We were that age, too, once.

13:02.435 --> 13:04.479
Only they dress better. Bye-bye.

13:04.562 --> 13:07.607
You have a generous nature.
I like that in a person.

13:08.399 --> 13:10.151
- My name is Max.
- I'm Lucy.

13:11.820 --> 13:13.863
- That's my dog, Thorn.
- Hi, Thorn.

13:13.947 --> 13:15.031
Say "hello," Thorn.

13:15.115 --> 13:16.991
So how may I help you this evening?

13:17.075 --> 13:18.118
We have it all.

13:18.201 --> 13:20.370
The best selection of video tapes
in Santa Carla.

13:20.453 --> 13:23.081
No, I'm not looking for a tape.

13:23.289 --> 13:24.999
What I need is...

13:25.291 --> 13:26.334
A job?

13:26.584 --> 13:27.627
...a job.

13:27.794 --> 13:29.796
Yeah. I look that needy, huh?

13:37.303 --> 13:39.597
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere.

13:39.722 --> 13:41.224
So what's the rush?

13:41.307 --> 13:43.226
You're chasing that girl, aren't you?

13:43.309 --> 13:45.562
Come on, admit it. You're chasing her.

13:45.645 --> 13:47.564
I'm at the mercy of your sex glands.

13:47.647 --> 13:51.568
Don't you have something better to do
than follow me around all night?

13:53.570 --> 13:55.155
Actually, I do.

14:32.358 --> 14:33.818
Got a problem guys?

14:34.068 --> 14:36.780
Just scoping your civilian wardrobe.

14:36.988 --> 14:38.448
Pretty cool, huh?

14:39.032 --> 14:40.658
For a fashion victim.

14:41.367 --> 14:44.162
If you're looking for
the diet frozen-yogurt bar...

14:44.245 --> 14:46.456
...it went out of business last summer.

14:46.539 --> 14:49.250
Actually, I'm looking for <i>Batman</i>, no. 14.

14:49.417 --> 14:50.960
That's a very serious book, man.

14:51.044 --> 14:52.587
Only five in existence.

14:52.670 --> 14:54.005
Four, actually.

14:54.589 --> 14:57.217
I'm always lookin' out for the other three.

14:59.260 --> 15:02.514
You can't put the <i>Superman</i>, no. 77
with the 200s.

15:02.722 --> 15:04.766
They haven't even discovered
red kryptonite yet.

15:04.849 --> 15:08.561
And you can't put the no. 98 with the 300s.

15:08.812 --> 15:11.356
Lori Lemaris hasn't even been introduced.

15:11.481 --> 15:13.608
Where the hell are you from? Krypton?

15:13.691 --> 15:15.193
Phoenix, actually.

15:15.276 --> 15:17.487
But, lucky me, we moved...

15:18.571 --> 15:19.572
...here.

15:24.202 --> 15:25.328
Take this.

15:27.914 --> 15:29.457
I don't like horror comics.

15:29.541 --> 15:31.709
You'll like this one, Mr. Phoenix.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.170
It could save your life.

16:16.963 --> 16:18.673
Come on, she stiffed ya.

16:44.324 --> 16:46.159
- What was that?
- What was what?

16:46.242 --> 16:48.745
- I thought I heard something.
- Forget it.

17:10.809 --> 17:13.269
- How do you like that baby?
- It's a beauty.

17:13.353 --> 17:14.938
Come on, let's get in.

17:15.980 --> 17:17.732
Can I drive on the way back?

17:17.816 --> 17:20.819
Fat chance.
Nobody drives this baby, but me.

17:32.997 --> 17:35.041
We have to let it warm up a little.

17:35.125 --> 17:38.211
Hear that sound?
Just like a baby pussycat.

17:39.045 --> 17:41.756
Okay, let's go to town.

17:47.262 --> 17:49.055
Are we having fun, or what?

17:49.139 --> 17:50.807
I thought we were going to town.

17:50.890 --> 17:53.726
That's as close to town as I like to get.

17:53.935 --> 17:55.436
Total weirdo, man.

18:17.167 --> 18:20.837
Noticed anything unusual
about Santa Carla yet?

18:20.962 --> 18:22.881
No, it's a pretty cool place.

18:24.174 --> 18:26.468
- If you're a Martian.
- Or a vampire.

18:27.594 --> 18:30.054
Are you sniffing old newsprint
or something?

18:30.138 --> 18:32.557
You think you really know
what's happening here.

18:32.640 --> 18:35.977
Well, I'll tell you something.
You don't know shit, buddy.

18:36.686 --> 18:39.647
You think we just work in
a comic bookstore for our folks?

18:39.731 --> 18:41.774
Actually, I thought it was a bakery.

18:41.858 --> 18:43.610
This is just our cover.

18:44.319 --> 18:46.780
We're dedicated to a higher purpose.

18:47.113 --> 18:49.032
We're fighters for "Truth...

18:49.574 --> 18:52.285
"...Justice, and the American way."

18:52.952 --> 18:54.078
All right.

18:58.208 --> 18:59.334
Read this.

19:00.460 --> 19:02.629
I told you I don't like horror comics.

19:02.879 --> 19:05.381
Think of it more as a survival manual.

19:05.924 --> 19:07.717
There's our number on the back...

19:07.801 --> 19:10.261
...and pray you never need to call us.

19:11.513 --> 19:12.722
I'll pray...

19:13.515 --> 19:15.391
...I never need to call you.

19:15.892 --> 19:16.893
Sure.

19:28.947 --> 19:31.574
It look's great. Definitely. Enjoy it.

19:32.367 --> 19:33.368
Thanks.

19:40.917 --> 19:42.043
Excuse me.

19:43.670 --> 19:44.963
It won't hurt.

19:48.925 --> 19:50.385
It's a rip-off.

19:54.722 --> 19:55.723
Hi.

19:57.016 --> 19:59.561
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.

20:00.770 --> 20:02.438
What's your name?

20:02.856 --> 20:03.731
Star.

20:03.857 --> 20:05.608
Oh, your folks, too, huh?

20:05.733 --> 20:08.111
- What do you mean?
- Ex-hippies.

20:08.236 --> 20:11.531
I came this close to being called
Moon Beam or Moon Child.

20:11.781 --> 20:13.491
Or something like that.

20:14.742 --> 20:16.911
But Star's great. I like Star.

20:17.287 --> 20:18.455
Me, too.

20:19.456 --> 20:20.665
I'm Michael.

20:21.082 --> 20:23.543
Michael's great. I like Michael.

20:26.004 --> 20:27.964
Want to get something to eat?

20:28.173 --> 20:29.215
Okay.

20:39.058 --> 20:40.894
Where are you going, Star?

20:41.352 --> 20:43.563
For a ride. This is Michael.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.191
Let's go.

20:46.274 --> 20:47.317
Star?

21:03.249 --> 21:06.461
You know where Hudson's Bluff is,
overlooking the point?

21:07.504 --> 21:08.922
I can't beat your bike.

21:09.005 --> 21:11.174
You don't have to beat me, Michael.

21:11.257 --> 21:13.426
You just have to try and keep up.

21:15.595 --> 21:17.305
We're going for a ride.

22:47.020 --> 22:48.396
Come on!

22:59.324 --> 23:01.034
Come on, Michael!

23:20.220 --> 23:22.388
- What the hell are you doing?
- No!

23:24.891 --> 23:26.559
Just you! Come on!

23:27.060 --> 23:28.353
Just you!

23:30.396 --> 23:32.232
Come on, just you.

23:34.317 --> 23:36.736
How far are you willing to go, Michael?

23:51.209 --> 23:53.586
Hit the rock box, buddy.

24:01.636 --> 24:03.012
Not bad, huh?

24:04.180 --> 24:07.725
This was the hottest resort in Santa Carla
about 85 years ago.

24:08.351 --> 24:10.603
Too bad they built it on a fault.

24:11.479 --> 24:13.439
In 1906...

24:14.107 --> 24:16.609
...when the big one hit San Francisco...

24:17.026 --> 24:20.155
...the ground opened up,
and this place took a header...

24:20.238 --> 24:21.948
...right into the crack.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.286
Now it's ours.

24:26.369 --> 24:28.413
So, check it out, Mikey.

24:29.289 --> 24:30.457
Marko...

24:31.166 --> 24:32.208
Food.

24:33.877 --> 24:36.171
That's what I love about this place.

24:36.421 --> 24:38.173
You ask, and then you get.

24:42.969 --> 24:44.762
Appetizer?

24:49.350 --> 24:51.311
You'll like it here, Michael.

24:54.856 --> 24:56.608
Ten o'clock. Lights out.

24:57.108 --> 24:58.610
Did you brush your teeth?

24:58.693 --> 25:00.028
Okay, 'night, sweetheart.

25:00.111 --> 25:01.196
Mom?

25:04.574 --> 25:05.700
Sorry.

25:07.035 --> 25:09.662
I can never sleep
with the closet door open, either.

25:09.746 --> 25:11.247
Not even a crack.

25:11.915 --> 25:15.668
Sam, this is a terrible thing to admit,
but I think that...

25:16.920 --> 25:19.506
...one of the reasons
I divorced your father...

25:19.589 --> 25:23.092
...was because he never believed
in the closet monster.

25:26.638 --> 25:30.225
Dad! Don't sneak up on people like that!

25:30.350 --> 25:33.520
Brought you somethin'
to dress up your room with, Sam.

25:34.395 --> 25:35.939
How do you like that?

25:36.064 --> 25:37.065
Thanks, Grandpa.

25:37.148 --> 25:39.776
Oh, Dad, really! You shouldn't have!

25:40.944 --> 25:42.737
Lots more where he came from.

25:42.821 --> 25:45.198
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Grandpa.

25:47.617 --> 25:48.618
Lights, Sam.

25:48.701 --> 25:51.037
As soon as I finish this comic, okay?

26:06.386 --> 26:08.513
You're history, buddy.

26:19.274 --> 26:21.568
Feeding time. Come and get it, boys.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.240
Chinese. Good choice.

26:28.783 --> 26:30.201
Over here, bud.

26:31.786 --> 26:33.037
Guests first.

26:34.289 --> 26:35.832
You don't like rice?

26:35.999 --> 26:39.586
Tell me, Michael, how could
a billion Chinese people be wrong?

26:41.796 --> 26:42.881
Come on.

26:52.098 --> 26:54.058
How are those maggots?

26:55.643 --> 26:57.020
Maggots, Michael.

26:57.103 --> 26:59.606
You're eating maggots.
How do they taste?

27:06.696 --> 27:08.323
Leave him alone.

27:22.170 --> 27:23.588
Sorry about that.

27:23.963 --> 27:25.632
No hard feelings, huh?

27:29.594 --> 27:31.638
Why don't you try some noodles?

27:34.265 --> 27:36.768
- They're worms.
- What do you mean, worms?

27:38.520 --> 27:39.979
Don't eat...

27:42.941 --> 27:44.943
They're only noodles, Michael.

27:49.697 --> 27:51.241
That's enough.

28:34.701 --> 28:36.619
Drink some of this, Michael.

28:38.746 --> 28:40.206
Be one of us.

28:58.183 --> 29:00.727
Don't! You don't have to, Michael.

29:06.149 --> 29:07.275
It's blood.

29:08.610 --> 29:10.320
Yeah, sure.

29:12.614 --> 29:14.324
Bravo!

29:19.454 --> 29:21.247
You were right, Marko.

29:28.421 --> 29:30.089
You're one of us, bud.

30:36.614 --> 30:37.866
Perfect timing.

30:40.535 --> 30:41.953
What's going on?

30:44.080 --> 30:46.583
Michael wants to know "what's going on."

30:48.168 --> 30:49.252
Marko?

30:49.836 --> 30:51.421
"What's going on?"

30:51.671 --> 30:52.881
I don't know.

30:52.964 --> 30:54.591
"What's going on," Paul?

30:54.674 --> 30:57.260
- Who wants to know?
- Michael wants to know.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.806
I think we should let Michael know
"what's going on."

31:05.185 --> 31:06.686
Marko...

31:07.061 --> 31:08.521
Good night, Michael.

31:08.605 --> 31:09.939
Bombs away.

31:11.357 --> 31:12.984
Bottoms up, man.

31:20.116 --> 31:21.826
Come with us, Michael.

31:33.588 --> 31:35.298
Michael Emerson...

31:36.216 --> 31:37.926
Come on down.

31:52.398 --> 31:54.400
Welcome aboard, Michael.

31:55.443 --> 31:56.486
Fun, huh?

32:11.417 --> 32:12.752
Hold on!

32:26.391 --> 32:28.393
Don't be scared, Michael!

32:35.775 --> 32:39.070
Michael, you're one of us. Let go!

32:39.821 --> 32:41.030
And do what?

32:41.114 --> 32:43.408
You are one of us, Michael.

32:48.163 --> 32:50.373
David!

34:08.201 --> 34:10.370
Mike, wake up.

34:12.871 --> 34:14.165
It's Mom.

34:15.375 --> 34:17.543
- Mom's home?
- No, on the phone.

34:18.878 --> 34:19.963
What time is it?

34:20.045 --> 34:21.422
It's two o'clock.

34:22.507 --> 34:24.217
Give me those sunglasses.

34:24.551 --> 34:27.053
You need sunglasses to talk on the phone?

34:27.137 --> 34:29.973
Are you freebasing?
Inquiring minds want to know.

34:35.895 --> 34:38.273
- Hello?
- <i>Michael, are you still in bed?</i>

34:38.356 --> 34:39.940
No. I'm up.

34:40.065 --> 34:42.193
Michael, would you do me a favor?

34:42.402 --> 34:44.737
Max asked me to go to dinner with him
after work tonight.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.281
Would you stay home with Sam?

34:46.364 --> 34:48.658
Sam is old enough to stay by himself.

34:48.741 --> 34:50.952
I don't need no babysitter, Mike.

34:51.327 --> 34:53.705
Michael, you come home
in the middle of the night...

34:53.788 --> 34:55.331
...you sleep all day.

34:55.498 --> 34:57.834
<i>I work all day. Sam is always alone.</i>

34:59.210 --> 35:02.005
It's been a long time
since somebody's asked me out to dinner.

35:02.088 --> 35:03.173
I'd like to go.

35:03.256 --> 35:04.215
<i>Okay?</i>

35:06.134 --> 35:07.260
Okay, Mom.

35:07.594 --> 35:09.471
Thanks, it's a real favor.

35:10.096 --> 35:11.181
Bye-bye.

35:26.613 --> 35:29.574
Anything in here
that might pass for after-shave?

35:32.660 --> 35:34.704
How about some Windex, Grandpa?

35:35.455 --> 35:37.457
Yeah, let me try some of that.

35:46.841 --> 35:49.010
Have a big date tonight, Grandpa?

35:51.971 --> 35:55.683
I'm going to drop off some of
my handiwork to the "Widow" Johnson.

35:55.767 --> 35:58.228
What'd you stuff for her? Mr. Johnson?

36:00.146 --> 36:01.856
See you two guys later.

36:02.816 --> 36:04.317
That wasn't funny!

36:17.413 --> 36:19.374
I'm gonna make you a sandwich.

36:20.291 --> 36:21.501
Don't bother.

36:21.709 --> 36:25.171
Lose the earring, Michael.
It's not you. It's definitely not you.

36:25.255 --> 36:26.131
Piss off.

36:26.214 --> 36:28.424
All you do is give attitude lately.

36:28.675 --> 36:31.177
You've been watching too much <i>Dynasty</i>.

37:10.341 --> 37:12.218
Mike, don't open the door!

37:30.236 --> 37:31.946
What's going on, Mike?

37:32.530 --> 37:33.990
Go take your bath.

39:50.543 --> 39:52.337
Michael, are you there?

39:54.631 --> 39:55.673
Nanook?

40:13.274 --> 40:15.026
Michael, what happened?

40:15.235 --> 40:17.028
- Nanook...
- What about Nanook?

40:17.112 --> 40:18.947
What did you do to my dog, asshole?

40:19.030 --> 40:22.492
Nothing. I didn't hurt him.
He bit me. This is my blood.

40:22.617 --> 40:24.327
Why did he bite you, huh?

40:24.410 --> 40:26.121
What did you do to him?

40:30.125 --> 40:31.751
He was protecting you.

40:34.045 --> 40:36.422
Look at your reflection in the mirror.

40:44.722 --> 40:46.516
You're a creature of the night.

40:46.599 --> 40:48.601
Just like out of a comic book.

40:48.935 --> 40:50.353
You're a vampire, Michael!

40:50.437 --> 40:53.064
My own brother,
a goddamn, shit-sucking vampire!

40:53.148 --> 40:54.899
Wait till Mom finds out!

40:55.066 --> 40:56.568
Sammy, wait! Sam!

40:56.776 --> 40:58.528
- Stay back!
- Just let me talk...

40:58.611 --> 41:00.530
Wait a minute! Sam!

41:02.949 --> 41:04.909
Stay away from me, Mike!

41:38.610 --> 41:40.570
You did the right thing by calling us.

41:40.653 --> 41:41.988
Does your brother sleep a lot?

41:42.071 --> 41:43.406
Yeah, all day.

41:43.698 --> 41:45.492
<i>Does the sunlight freak him out?</i>

41:45.575 --> 41:47.494
He wears sunglasses in the house.

41:47.577 --> 41:49.996
<i>Bad breath? Long fingernails?</i>

41:50.330 --> 41:52.916
Yeah, his fingernails are a bit longer...

41:52.999 --> 41:55.168
He always had bad breath, though.

41:55.877 --> 41:57.629
He's a vampire all right.

41:57.837 --> 41:59.464
<i>Here's what you do.</i>

41:59.672 --> 42:02.008
Get yourself a good sharp stake...

42:02.258 --> 42:03.843
...and drive it through his heart.

42:03.927 --> 42:05.637
I can't do that! He's my brother!

42:05.720 --> 42:07.597
<i>Okay, we'll come over and do it for you.</i>

42:07.680 --> 42:08.431
No!

42:08.515 --> 42:11.351
You better get yourself
a garlic T-shirt, buddy.

42:11.434 --> 42:13.061
Or it's your funeral.

43:16.374 --> 43:17.250
Hello.

43:17.333 --> 43:19.169
Sam, is everything all right?

43:19.252 --> 43:22.755
Mom, I think we have to have
a real long talk about something.

43:22.964 --> 43:24.174
Help!

43:24.299 --> 43:27.510
<i>What's going on there?</i>
<i>Sam, I'm starting to get worried.</i>

43:29.304 --> 43:32.932
<i>What are you doing? Is that Michael?</i>
<i>Who's breathing like that?</i>

43:33.767 --> 43:36.561
- <i>We should stay calm.</i>
- <i>Calm? Calm about what?</i>

43:37.020 --> 43:40.273
- Nothing, nothing.
- <i>Who's making that noise?</i>

43:40.732 --> 43:43.193
Mom, I can't talk on the phone.
It's about Michael.

43:43.276 --> 43:46.154
Don't listen to him, Mom.
<i>He doesn't know what he's saying.</i>

43:46.237 --> 43:47.197
Shut up!

43:47.280 --> 43:49.032
Mom! Help! He's coming to get me!

43:49.115 --> 43:50.617
Oh, my God!

43:51.993 --> 43:52.827
He'll kill me!

43:52.911 --> 43:54.412
Honey, I'm coming.

43:55.622 --> 43:57.916
<i>Tell him to get away! No! Mom!</i>

44:10.970 --> 44:12.388
Open up!

44:12.806 --> 44:14.098
Stay back!

44:14.224 --> 44:16.267
Sammy, help me! Open up!

44:16.351 --> 44:17.185
Help me!

44:17.268 --> 44:18.937
Sammy, open the window!

44:19.020 --> 44:20.271
Never! I knew it!

44:20.355 --> 44:21.356
I'm not!

44:21.439 --> 44:23.775
So what are you, the "flying nun"?

44:24.192 --> 44:26.903
I'm your brother, Sammy. Help me!

44:28.154 --> 44:30.073
Sammy, open up!

44:40.416 --> 44:41.918
Please?

44:42.961 --> 44:44.337
Please!

44:49.509 --> 44:50.718
Thanks.

44:52.846 --> 44:56.349
We've got to stick together, Sam.

44:56.808 --> 44:58.309
What about Mom?

44:58.393 --> 45:00.353
Just don't tell her anything.

45:01.020 --> 45:04.357
I don't know, Mike.
It's not like getting a "D" in school.

45:07.777 --> 45:08.987
We're gonna work this out.

45:09.070 --> 45:11.573
I'm gonna work this out. Trust me, okay?

45:19.873 --> 45:21.666
Sam, are you all right?

45:21.749 --> 45:23.793
You had me scared to death.

45:24.794 --> 45:26.546
I'm okay. I was reading a horror comic.

45:26.629 --> 45:30.592
I thought I saw someone on my window,
but I guess I got carried away.

45:30.758 --> 45:33.094
You got carried away by a comic book?

45:34.220 --> 45:36.723
It was a scary comic book, Mom.
I'm sorry.

45:38.391 --> 45:41.519
You know, I've just about had it
with the both of you.

45:45.648 --> 45:47.275
What is this mess?

45:47.901 --> 45:51.029
You spill milk on the kitchen floor
and don't even bother to clean it up?

45:51.112 --> 45:52.113
I didn't spill it.

45:52.197 --> 45:55.241
I can't believe you.
The refrigerator door's wide open!

45:55.325 --> 45:57.827
Are you trying to refrigerate
the whole neighborhood?

45:57.911 --> 46:01.122
You know, it's not fair.
I'd like to have a personal life, too.

46:01.206 --> 46:02.373
Where's Michael?

46:02.457 --> 46:04.083
He went to bed early.

46:28.191 --> 46:30.777
Mom? Can I sleep in here
with you tonight?

46:30.902 --> 46:33.279
In here? Are you sure you're all right?

46:33.363 --> 46:35.448
I'm fine. It was a real scary comic,
that's all.

46:35.532 --> 46:37.617
- Do you mind?
- No, I don't mind.

46:39.786 --> 46:41.162
Have you been eating pizza?

46:41.246 --> 46:42.413
No. Why?

46:43.248 --> 46:44.916
You smell like garlic.

47:27.792 --> 47:29.169
Who's there?

47:32.464 --> 47:33.715
Hello, Thorn.

47:34.257 --> 47:36.801
Is that you, Thorn, making all that noise?

48:36.152 --> 48:37.821
I'm over here, Michael.

48:38.113 --> 48:40.073
What's happening to me, Star?

48:42.075 --> 48:44.035
What's happening to me, Star?

48:44.244 --> 48:45.829
Oh, Michael!

48:46.329 --> 48:49.541
Michael, I can't tell you.
I don't know how to help you.

48:50.250 --> 48:51.709
What's happening?

50:57.919 --> 50:58.920
Hi.

51:01.297 --> 51:03.216
Aren't we friends anymore?

51:03.550 --> 51:04.551
Sure.

51:06.302 --> 51:09.597
Does that mean we are, or...?

51:10.140 --> 51:11.474
We are.

51:12.392 --> 51:14.185
Then let's act like friends.

51:14.269 --> 51:15.395
Let's talk.

51:18.690 --> 51:20.733
Michael, take off your glasses.

51:27.073 --> 51:28.575
Michael, look at me.

51:30.452 --> 51:32.078
If there's a girl...

51:32.203 --> 51:33.037
I'm tired, Mom.

51:33.121 --> 51:34.539
- We could talk about...
- I'm tired.

51:34.622 --> 51:37.167
We can talk about anything
you want to talk about.

51:37.250 --> 51:39.461
I have more serious things on my mind
than girls and school.

51:39.544 --> 51:40.753
Things I'm dealing with...

51:40.837 --> 51:42.755
Things I wouldn't understand?

51:54.392 --> 51:57.729
Looks like I wasn't the only one
who got lucky last night.

51:59.939 --> 52:02.484
Did you take care of everything, Michael?

52:22.295 --> 52:23.254
What's the wine for?

52:23.338 --> 52:26.257
My apology to Max for running out
on him last night.

52:26.341 --> 52:28.802
Which, young man, you should be making.

52:33.640 --> 52:37.143
I better bring this up to the house
or somebody's just gonna take it.

52:37.227 --> 52:38.937
All right, I'll be here.

52:51.074 --> 52:52.700
Hi, Thorn.

53:01.501 --> 53:02.585
Mom!

53:16.850 --> 53:19.352
Honey, get in the car! Get in the car!

53:21.646 --> 53:25.442
The dog chased my mom like the Hounds
of Hell from <i>Vampires Everywhere</i>.

53:25.525 --> 53:29.571
We've been aware of some very serious
vampire activity in town for a long time.

53:29.654 --> 53:32.240
Santa Carla has become a haven
for the undead.

53:32.323 --> 53:34.617
As a matter of fact,
we're almost certain that...

53:34.701 --> 53:37.954
...ghouls and werewolves
occupy high positions at City Hall.

53:38.037 --> 53:40.540
Kill your brother. You'll feel better.

53:42.167 --> 53:44.586
Look, guys, my brother is not
a bloodsucker.

53:44.669 --> 53:47.255
It says here that
if you kill the head vampire...

53:47.338 --> 53:49.632
...all half-vampires will return to normal.

53:49.716 --> 53:52.760
Guys, if my brother's a vampire,
believe me, he's only half.

53:52.844 --> 53:55.054
Does he know who the head vampire is?

53:55.138 --> 53:56.723
No, I don't think so.

53:57.140 --> 53:59.058
Then you'll have to kill him.

53:59.142 --> 54:00.602
And if you don't...

54:01.394 --> 54:02.520
...we will.

54:03.730 --> 54:07.192
It all started when my mom
went to work at Max's video store.

54:08.276 --> 54:10.779
Max never comes in till after it's dark.

54:10.904 --> 54:13.573
The dog who chased my mom
this morning was his.

54:13.656 --> 54:17.744
Listen to this: "Vampires require
a daytime protector, a guardian...

54:18.077 --> 54:19.788
"...to watch over them as they sleep.

54:19.871 --> 54:23.958
"Fierce dogs, the Hounds of Hell,
are often employed for this purpose."

54:25.293 --> 54:28.296
What happens if my mom is dating
the head vampire?

54:29.130 --> 54:31.633
You could nail him and save Santa Carla.

54:31.758 --> 54:34.719
"Truth, Justice,
the American way" triumphs.

54:35.220 --> 54:36.679
Thanks to you two.

54:38.389 --> 54:39.891
We'll check out Max.

55:10.421 --> 55:11.965
Smells good. When do we eat?

55:12.048 --> 55:14.050
I told Max eight o'clock.

55:14.134 --> 55:15.093
Max?

55:15.176 --> 55:16.678
Are we going to have company again?

55:16.761 --> 55:17.971
Again?

55:18.054 --> 55:21.474
You haven't had company in this house
since Mom died eight years ago.

55:21.558 --> 55:23.810
Right. Now we're gonna
have company again.

55:23.893 --> 55:27.230
Michael, Max is coming to dinner.
I'd like you to meet him.

55:27.313 --> 55:29.023
I can't. I have plans.

55:29.149 --> 55:30.358
Michael...

55:31.317 --> 55:34.529
Things will change around this house
when school starts.

55:37.907 --> 55:40.493
How you doing?
You must be Michael, right?

55:42.245 --> 55:44.205
And you must be Max.

55:52.338 --> 55:54.591
Well, you're the man of the house...

55:54.757 --> 55:57.093
...and I'm not coming in until you invite me.

55:57.177 --> 55:58.470
You're invited.

55:59.554 --> 56:00.972
Thanks very much.

56:11.024 --> 56:11.941
Hello.

56:12.025 --> 56:14.277
Oh, hi. I didn't hear you come in.

56:14.486 --> 56:16.780
Is it okay for the guest to see the food
before dinner?

56:16.863 --> 56:20.450
You're thinking of the groom
not seeing the bride before the wedding.

56:20.533 --> 56:23.119
Oh, yeah. I always get those confused.

56:23.703 --> 56:25.497
Thorn sends his apologies.

56:25.663 --> 56:27.457
Tell him I'm walking again.

56:28.750 --> 56:31.127
He promises to behave if you come back.

56:37.383 --> 56:38.593
Mom?

56:39.719 --> 56:41.137
These are my dinner guests.

56:41.221 --> 56:43.473
Edgar and Alan. The Frog brothers.

56:44.432 --> 56:46.810
I didn't know you were having guests.

56:46.893 --> 56:50.396
If we'll be in your way, we can eat
some peanut butter in the kitchen.

56:50.480 --> 56:52.524
No, no, there's plenty for everybody.

56:52.607 --> 56:56.152
Max, this is my son, Sam,
and Edgar and Alan... Frog?

56:58.905 --> 57:00.073
Lucy, this looks terrific.

57:00.156 --> 57:02.075
Well, I hope it tastes good.

57:02.575 --> 57:04.202
Tastes wonderful.

57:05.662 --> 57:08.832
Boy! Somebody around here
has bad breath!

57:15.130 --> 57:17.298
Nanook, would you quit breathing on me!

57:17.382 --> 57:19.384
Nanook, get upstairs. Go on.

57:25.515 --> 57:27.851
You want some Parmesan cheese on that?

57:27.934 --> 57:30.019
Yeah, Sam. Thank you very much.

57:30.520 --> 57:32.939
Sam grated the cheese himself. My son.

57:37.610 --> 57:40.113
A budding chef in the family.

57:46.619 --> 57:48.079
Are you all right?

57:50.165 --> 57:52.125
It's not cheese, it's garlic.

57:52.459 --> 57:53.877
You hate garlic, don't you?

57:53.960 --> 57:56.921
No, I like garlic. It's just too much...

57:57.589 --> 57:58.965
It's raw garlic.

57:59.841 --> 58:01.843
Garlic? How did that happen?

58:01.968 --> 58:03.553
Guys, he likes garlic.

58:05.180 --> 58:07.223
Here. Quick, drink some water!

58:08.558 --> 58:11.144
Sam, what's the matter with you?

58:11.311 --> 58:12.437
Does it burn?

58:12.520 --> 58:14.105
Burn? Are you nuts?

58:14.481 --> 58:15.899
It's freezing!

58:16.024 --> 58:18.568
Look at your suit, Max. And your pants.

58:18.693 --> 58:20.653
Oh, I'm so sorry.

58:21.988 --> 58:22.947
Now what?

58:23.031 --> 58:24.824
Must be a circuit breaker.

58:25.116 --> 58:26.117
He's not glowing.

58:26.201 --> 58:27.952
I know. Hit the lights.

58:30.830 --> 58:33.166
Sam! What's gotten into you tonight?

58:33.416 --> 58:35.418
I think I know what's going on here.

58:35.502 --> 58:36.503
You do?

58:36.878 --> 58:37.837
Yeah.

58:38.713 --> 58:41.132
I know what you're thinking, Sam.
But you're wrong.

58:41.216 --> 58:42.425
- I am?
- Yeah.

58:43.009 --> 58:45.095
I'm not trying to replace your father...

58:45.178 --> 58:47.138
...or steal your mother away from you.

58:47.222 --> 58:50.058
I would just like to be your friend.
That's all.

58:50.433 --> 58:51.851
Good night, Lucy.

58:52.352 --> 58:53.603
Thanks a lot!

58:53.853 --> 58:55.355
I'm sorry, Mom.

58:55.605 --> 58:57.107
Max, I'm so sorry.

58:58.942 --> 59:00.235
Major mistake.

59:02.195 --> 59:05.365
Our batting average isn't terrific, is it?
Zero for two.

59:05.907 --> 59:07.742
You were so sweet to him.

59:07.867 --> 59:10.787
I don't know what got into him.
He's not like that.

59:10.870 --> 59:14.499
Kids Sam's age need discipline,
otherwise they run all over you.

59:14.749 --> 59:16.543
He doesn't run over me.

59:17.377 --> 59:18.795
Protecting mother.

59:21.548 --> 59:23.049
Let's try it once more.

59:23.133 --> 59:25.343
Dinner, my house, tomorrow night.

59:26.553 --> 59:28.054
- I'm cooking.
- Okay.

59:48.199 --> 59:49.451
Where is she?

59:52.412 --> 59:54.038
Take it easy, Michael.

59:54.205 --> 59:56.332
Where's Star, David?

59:57.667 --> 01:00:00.253
If you ever want to see Star again...

01:00:00.712 --> 01:00:02.839
...you better come with us now.

01:00:47.801 --> 01:00:50.386
Michael, over here.

01:00:57.727 --> 01:00:59.646
You don't want to miss this.

01:01:23.128 --> 01:01:25.630
Initiation's over, Michael.

01:01:26.381 --> 01:01:28.007
Time to join the club.

01:03:02.393 --> 01:03:04.145
Now you know what we are.

01:03:04.604 --> 01:03:06.356
Now you know what you are.

01:03:07.273 --> 01:03:09.275
You'll never grow old, Michael.

01:03:10.485 --> 01:03:12.445
And you'll never die.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.782
But you must feed.

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:45.061
I wish Grandpa would stop giving me
these stupid things.

01:03:56.281 --> 01:03:57.991
I know who I am now, Sam.

01:03:58.241 --> 01:03:59.742
Don't kill me, Mike!

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.745
I'm basically a good kid, so don't kill me!

01:04:03.329 --> 01:04:04.539
I can help you.

01:04:04.622 --> 01:04:06.875
Just tell me who the head vampire is.

01:04:06.958 --> 01:04:09.085
I thought it was Max, but I was wrong.

01:04:09.169 --> 01:04:11.796
Just work with me and I can help you.
You'll be okay.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:12.922
Michael!

01:04:13.673 --> 01:04:14.716
Michael!

01:04:16.634 --> 01:04:18.762
It's that girl from the boardwalk.
Is she one of them?

01:04:18.845 --> 01:04:21.473
- I have to talk to you. Can I come up?
- No!

01:04:22.348 --> 01:04:24.768
You shut the window and lock your door.

01:04:28.146 --> 01:04:29.606
She's one of them!

01:04:30.356 --> 01:04:33.651
And don't tell me it doesn't make her
a bad person, Mike!

01:04:34.652 --> 01:04:37.405
You know where David took me tonight,
don't you, Star?

01:04:37.489 --> 01:04:38.490
Who's David?

01:04:38.573 --> 01:04:40.617
Yes, and it's my fault.

01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:43.870
If you hadn't met me,
if I hadn't liked you...

01:04:44.287 --> 01:04:45.789
I tried to warn you.

01:04:45.997 --> 01:04:48.541
It was that night in the cave, wasn't it?

01:04:48.708 --> 01:04:51.795
That wasn't wine they gave me to drink.
It was blood.

01:04:52.212 --> 01:04:53.505
That was David's blood.

01:04:53.588 --> 01:04:56.091
You drank someone's blood?
Are you crazy?

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.802
I'm just like David now, Star.

01:04:58.885 --> 01:05:01.429
No, you're not. You're like Laddie and me.

01:05:01.513 --> 01:05:04.808
- We're not one of them...
- Until you make your first kill!

01:05:06.101 --> 01:05:08.228
Why didn't you kill me last night?

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:11.397
You were supposed to be my first.

01:05:12.107 --> 01:05:13.817
That's what David wanted.

01:05:17.278 --> 01:05:18.988
But I couldn't, Michael.

01:05:19.197 --> 01:05:20.073
Why?

01:05:21.116 --> 01:05:23.785
Because you care so much about me?

01:05:24.119 --> 01:05:25.245
Yes, I do.

01:05:34.796 --> 01:05:37.715
What are you doing here?
What do you want from me?

01:05:38.758 --> 01:05:41.803
I wanted to tell you
that it's not too late for you.

01:05:44.097 --> 01:05:46.850
But for me it gets
harder and harder to resist.

01:05:46.975 --> 01:05:48.309
I'm weak.

01:05:48.643 --> 01:05:50.937
Why did you come here tonight, Star?

01:05:51.729 --> 01:05:54.274
I was hoping you would help
Laddie and me.

01:06:05.201 --> 01:06:06.286
Star!

01:06:06.744 --> 01:06:09.372
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you.

01:06:11.124 --> 01:06:12.500
What are you doing?

01:06:12.584 --> 01:06:14.169
I've got connections.

01:06:28.641 --> 01:06:30.435
Okay. Where's Nosferatu?

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.020
- Who?
- The Prince of Darkness.

01:06:32.103 --> 01:06:33.563
The night crawler. The bloodsucker.

01:06:33.646 --> 01:06:34.898
<i>El Vampiro</i>.

01:06:34.981 --> 01:06:36.816
Mike, they're here!

01:06:49.621 --> 01:06:52.332
Grandpa, okay if we borrow the car?

01:07:18.608 --> 01:07:20.235
Weapons check.

01:07:26.574 --> 01:07:28.076
I don't want you going down there.

01:07:28.159 --> 01:07:29.369
I'm going.

01:07:29.452 --> 01:07:32.288
Look, this isn't a comic book, Sammy.
These guys are brutal killers.

01:07:32.372 --> 01:07:34.124
So are the Frog brothers.

01:07:34.874 --> 01:07:36.126
Check me.

01:07:36.501 --> 01:07:39.420
Who'd you rather have go down there
with you? Them or me?

01:07:39.504 --> 01:07:42.799
If something happens down there,
I won't have the strength to protect you.

01:07:42.882 --> 01:07:44.717
This time I'll protect you.

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:48.638
Even though you're a vampire,
you're still my brother.

01:07:49.681 --> 01:07:54.060
Listen, just so you know: If you try
to stop us, or vamp-out in any way...

01:07:54.227 --> 01:07:57.355
...I'll stake you without even
thinking twice about it.

01:07:57.439 --> 01:07:58.898
Chill out, Edgar.

01:08:02.235 --> 01:08:04.612
Where did you say you met these guys?

01:08:08.741 --> 01:08:09.868
Holy shit!

01:08:09.951 --> 01:08:11.244
Vampire hotel!

01:08:14.956 --> 01:08:16.832
Here's one. Let's stake her!

01:08:16.916 --> 01:08:18.209
Don't you touch her!

01:08:18.292 --> 01:08:20.002
Stay away from her!

01:08:20.170 --> 01:08:22.756
Come on, vampires have
such rotten tempers.

01:08:25.633 --> 01:08:29.261
The rest of them have got to
be here someplace. We'll find 'em.

01:08:30.596 --> 01:08:31.805
Star?

01:08:34.225 --> 01:08:36.895
- I'm taking you out of here.
- No, take Laddie first.

01:08:36.978 --> 01:08:37.979
Please?

01:08:39.898 --> 01:08:42.734
I feel a draft.
I think there's something up here.

01:08:42.817 --> 01:08:45.111
- Let's check it out, Sam.
- Come on.

01:08:51.658 --> 01:08:53.495
I'll be right back, Mike.

01:08:54.787 --> 01:08:55.747
I hope.

01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:57.624
Come on, Sam, let's go.

01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:59.082
Move out! Move!

01:09:04.296 --> 01:09:05.048
Flies!

01:09:05.131 --> 01:09:06.424
We're on the right trail.

01:09:06.508 --> 01:09:09.219
Flies and the undead go together,
like bullets and guns.

01:09:09.301 --> 01:09:10.345
Come on!

01:09:32.158 --> 01:09:33.660
What's that smell?

01:09:34.618 --> 01:09:37.747
Vampires, my friend. Vampires.

01:09:57.767 --> 01:09:59.394
It's freezing in here.

01:10:03.815 --> 01:10:05.984
It looks like a dead end. Let's head back.

01:10:06.067 --> 01:10:09.070
They must have hidden their coffins
here someplace.

01:10:09.529 --> 01:10:11.281
There's nothing here. Let's go, guys.

01:10:11.364 --> 01:10:12.407
Jesus!

01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:22.792
I thought they'd be in coffins.

01:10:22.876 --> 01:10:24.127
That's what this cave is.

01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:25.795
It's one giant coffin.

01:10:29.549 --> 01:10:31.551
Right now they're at their most vulnerable.

01:10:31.634 --> 01:10:32.886
Easy pickings.

01:10:32.969 --> 01:10:35.054
Remember, you just have to kill the leader.

01:10:35.138 --> 01:10:37.140
We don't know which one he is.

01:10:37.432 --> 01:10:39.559
I guess we'll just have to kill them all.

01:10:39.642 --> 01:10:43.396
Let's start with the little one.
First come, first staked.

01:10:43.688 --> 01:10:46.357
What was that, a little vampire humor?

01:10:46.733 --> 01:10:48.193
It wasn't funny.

01:10:53.281 --> 01:10:54.741
No!

01:10:55.492 --> 01:10:57.494
Good night, bloodsucker!

01:11:18.973 --> 01:11:20.934
You're dead meat!

01:11:43.873 --> 01:11:45.667
Get him into the sunlight!

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.611
Tonight...

01:12:15.947 --> 01:12:17.782
Mike! Start the car!

01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:29.127
- We blew it, man! We lost it!
- Shut up!

01:12:29.210 --> 01:12:31.588
- We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
- It's not our fault.

01:12:31.671 --> 01:12:34.299
They pulled a mind-scramble on us!
They opened their eyes and talked!

01:12:34.382 --> 01:12:35.925
I'll drive.

01:12:36.217 --> 01:12:37.761
We don't ride with vampires.

01:12:37.844 --> 01:12:39.262
Fine. Stay here.

01:12:41.514 --> 01:12:42.932
- We do now.
- Yeah.

01:12:43.725 --> 01:12:46.060
Come on! Sam, let's get out of here!

01:12:47.061 --> 01:12:48.271
Burn rubber!

01:12:55.028 --> 01:12:58.198
"Burn rubber" does not mean warp speed!

01:13:08.875 --> 01:13:10.001
Cool it, Nanook!

01:13:10.084 --> 01:13:11.795
Your dog knows a flesh-eater
when he smells one.

01:13:11.878 --> 01:13:13.713
Take him outside, Sam.

01:13:14.339 --> 01:13:16.049
Come on, Nanook.

01:13:18.885 --> 01:13:20.011
Michael.

01:13:21.387 --> 01:13:24.307
Do you know the rule
about filling up the car with gas...

01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:26.434
...when you take it without asking?

01:13:26.518 --> 01:13:27.894
No, Grandpa.

01:13:28.645 --> 01:13:29.896
Now you do.

01:13:39.572 --> 01:13:41.157
We definitely blew Plan A.

01:13:41.241 --> 01:13:42.283
Time to activate Plan B.

01:13:42.367 --> 01:13:43.952
- What's Plan B?
- We don't have one yet.

01:13:44.035 --> 01:13:45.829
We have two and a half hours
to come up with one.

01:13:45.912 --> 01:13:47.080
What happens then?

01:13:47.163 --> 01:13:49.833
The sun goes down.
They'll be looking for us.

01:13:56.756 --> 01:13:58.258
Sam, what are you doing here?

01:13:58.341 --> 01:14:00.844
I've got to tell you something.
It's real important.

01:14:00.927 --> 01:14:03.263
Santa Carla is crawling with vampires.

01:14:03.596 --> 01:14:04.681
Mom, I'm serious!

01:14:04.764 --> 01:14:07.183
Edgar staked one of them.
It was screaming and fizzing!

01:14:07.267 --> 01:14:09.144
Look, there's evidence on my sweater!

01:14:09.227 --> 01:14:11.312
Mom, you've got to tell someone!

01:14:11.646 --> 01:14:13.940
- You've got to tell someone!
- This isn't funny!

01:14:14.023 --> 01:14:16.693
I'm not kidding! They're coming
to the house when it gets dark!

01:14:16.776 --> 01:14:18.987
Stop it! Right now! Stop it!

01:14:19.696 --> 01:14:21.364
- But, Mom...
- Not another word!

01:14:21.448 --> 01:14:22.699
I don't believe you're doing this.

01:14:22.782 --> 01:14:24.909
I want to see Max tonight,
and you're trying to ruin it for me.

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.119
No, I'm not.

01:14:26.202 --> 01:14:29.372
There's nothing wrong with Max.
I don't know why you don't want me...

01:14:29.456 --> 01:14:32.083
I'm not talking about Max!
To hell with Max!

01:14:34.419 --> 01:14:36.671
I'll deal with you later, young man!

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:44.387
Guys, we're on our own.

01:14:44.554 --> 01:14:46.931
Good. That's just the way we like it.

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:23.426
Widow Johnson called.
Said to pick her up at seven, not eight.

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:25.261
We've got a date tonight?

01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:27.806
I guess so. She said not to be late.

01:15:28.598 --> 01:15:30.600
I better get cleaned up, then.

01:15:52.539 --> 01:15:54.374
Die, Mr. Vampire!

01:16:16.604 --> 01:16:19.399
They'll be coming for Laddie and me,
won't they?

01:16:20.567 --> 01:16:22.652
They'll be coming for all of us.

01:16:24.529 --> 01:16:26.281
Laddie, wake up.

01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:43.233
- Oh, it's delicious.
- Thank you.

01:17:45.485 --> 01:17:47.028
Thorn, stop that!

01:17:49.239 --> 01:17:50.907
What's the matter, Lucy?

01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:53.409
It's just old memories coming back.

01:17:53.618 --> 01:17:56.246
No, seriously.
Why are you so jumpy tonight?

01:17:56.329 --> 01:17:57.789
Well, it's something Sam...

01:17:57.872 --> 01:17:59.582
He came into the store...

01:17:59.666 --> 01:18:02.544
It was just a kid's imagination,
I'm sure, but...

01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:04.796
...he seemed so sincere, but...

01:18:05.672 --> 01:18:06.756
It's insane.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.008
Tell me. I promise not to laugh.

01:18:09.342 --> 01:18:10.343
Honest.

01:18:15.932 --> 01:18:17.475
I think I should warn you all:

01:18:17.559 --> 01:18:20.228
When a vampire dies,
it's never a pretty sight.

01:18:20.311 --> 01:18:22.856
No two bloodsuckers go out the same way.

01:18:23.106 --> 01:18:25.358
Some yell and scream. Some go quietly.

01:18:25.442 --> 01:18:27.360
Some explode. Some implode.

01:18:28.027 --> 01:18:30.405
But all will try to take you with them.

01:18:47.839 --> 01:18:49.674
Nanook! I left him outside.

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:51.760
Don't go out there! Stop him!

01:18:54.304 --> 01:18:56.055
- Sam, come back!
- No way!

01:19:20.497 --> 01:19:22.707
Michael, they're coming!

01:19:25.001 --> 01:19:26.586
They're coming!

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.381
Hurry up, man!

01:19:43.103 --> 01:19:44.813
Take them upstairs!

01:20:01.121 --> 01:20:03.998
- I say we terminate them right now.
- Laddie, run!

01:20:12.298 --> 01:20:14.008
You're mine.

01:20:15.218 --> 01:20:16.386
You killed Marko.

01:20:16.469 --> 01:20:17.846
Yeah. You're next.

01:20:17.929 --> 01:20:19.472
No. You're next.

01:20:25.228 --> 01:20:27.188
Garlic don't work, boys.

01:20:27.272 --> 01:20:29.441
Try the holy water, death breath!

01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:02.242
Mike, wake up.

01:22:42.365 --> 01:22:43.825
You missed, sucker.

01:22:44.033 --> 01:22:45.368
Only once, pal.

01:23:16.065 --> 01:23:17.817
Death by stereo.

01:23:51.226 --> 01:23:52.310
Hey, it's me.

01:23:52.393 --> 01:23:53.394
Are you okay?

01:23:53.478 --> 01:23:56.564
I nailed one of them downstairs
with a bow and arrow.

01:23:57.816 --> 01:23:59.943
We trashed the one
that looked like Twisted Sister.

01:24:00.026 --> 01:24:02.695
We totally annihilated
his night stalkin' ass!

01:24:04.072 --> 01:24:05.865
And Nanook helped a little.

01:24:06.991 --> 01:24:08.701
Death to all vampires!

01:24:08.785 --> 01:24:10.245
Maximum body count.

01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:11.955
We are awesome monster bashers!

01:24:12.038 --> 01:24:13.164
The meanest!

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:14.541
The baddest!

01:24:33.977 --> 01:24:34.936
Holy shit!

01:24:35.019 --> 01:24:37.355
The attack of Eddie Munster! Get him!

01:24:37.689 --> 01:24:40.483
Stop! Get away from him!
Just stay away from him!

01:24:40.567 --> 01:24:42.235
He's just a little boy!

01:25:00.837 --> 01:25:02.922
You're afraid to face me, David?

01:25:09.429 --> 01:25:11.139
I tried to make you immortal.

01:25:11.222 --> 01:25:13.224
You tried to make me a killer!

01:25:23.276 --> 01:25:24.736
You are a killer.

01:25:47.592 --> 01:25:48.843
My turn.

01:25:58.061 --> 01:26:01.981
Stop fighting me, Michael.
I don't want to kill you.

01:26:02.982 --> 01:26:03.983
Join us.

01:26:04.901 --> 01:26:06.111
Never!

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:12.158
It's too late. My blood is in your veins.

01:26:15.495 --> 01:26:17.205
So is mine!

01:27:19.559 --> 01:27:21.644
Don't let them see me like this.

01:27:25.774 --> 01:27:27.025
Get away, Sam.

01:27:27.901 --> 01:27:30.445
- Michael, what's wrong?
- I said, get away!

01:27:35.408 --> 01:27:37.994
What's the big deal?
You destroyed the head vampire.

01:27:38.077 --> 01:27:39.120
It's all over.

01:27:39.204 --> 01:27:40.663
Nothing's changed.

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:43.416
He's right. I don't feel any different.

01:27:43.541 --> 01:27:45.460
Then there's still one more.

01:27:52.634 --> 01:27:54.969
I'll handle Mom. Come on, go.

01:27:55.095 --> 01:27:57.013
Don't let her see the bodies.

01:27:59.224 --> 01:28:00.433
What happened?

01:28:01.601 --> 01:28:03.019
Where is Michael?

01:28:03.394 --> 01:28:05.188
What happened to your face?

01:28:05.396 --> 01:28:07.273
What happened to your face?

01:28:30.797 --> 01:28:34.592
I don't want to hear another word
from you until I talk to Michael.

01:28:34.801 --> 01:28:36.302
I'm sorry, Lucy.

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:38.555
This is all my fault.

01:28:39.305 --> 01:28:41.266
David and my boys misbehaved.

01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:44.811
I told you, boys need a mother.

01:28:45.061 --> 01:28:47.147
Max, what are you talking about?

01:28:49.232 --> 01:28:51.734
I knew it! You're the head vampire!

01:28:51.901 --> 01:28:53.695
Sam, don't start this again.

01:28:53.778 --> 01:28:56.406
You're the secret
that David was protecting.

01:28:58.116 --> 01:28:59.200
Who's this?

01:28:59.284 --> 01:29:00.994
But you passed the test.

01:29:01.995 --> 01:29:05.707
Don't ever invite a vampire
into your house, you silly boy.

01:29:05.957 --> 01:29:07.667
It renders you powerless.

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:09.753
Did you know that?

01:29:09.836 --> 01:29:10.920
Of course.

01:29:11.004 --> 01:29:12.380
Everyone knows that.

01:29:12.464 --> 01:29:16.134
Has everyone gone crazy?
What's the matter with all of you?

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:19.512
It was you I was after, all along, Lucy.

01:29:19.679 --> 01:29:20.680
What?

01:29:20.847 --> 01:29:21.931
I knew...

01:29:22.849 --> 01:29:26.102
...that if I could get Sam and Michael
into the family...

01:29:26.519 --> 01:29:28.271
...there was no way you could say no.

01:29:28.354 --> 01:29:29.814
Where's Michael?

01:29:30.023 --> 01:29:32.525
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.

01:29:36.446 --> 01:29:38.615
Just like one big happy family.

01:29:41.743 --> 01:29:42.994
Your boys...

01:29:44.537 --> 01:29:45.789
...and my boys.

01:29:45.872 --> 01:29:48.500
Great. "The Bloodsucking Brady Bunch."

01:29:49.876 --> 01:29:51.544
I still want you, Lucy.

01:29:53.713 --> 01:29:56.091
I haven't changed my mind about that.

01:29:56.758 --> 01:29:59.010
I didn't invite you this time, Max!

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:00.845
Michael!

01:30:18.238 --> 01:30:20.031
Don't you touch my mother!

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:33.128
Don't fight, Lucy.
It's so much better if you don't fight.

01:30:34.295 --> 01:30:35.672
Mom, don't!

01:30:36.881 --> 01:30:39.092
Don't do it, Mom! Mom, don't do it!

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:39.235
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:31:59.964 --> 01:32:01.549
It's over.

01:32:12.352 --> 01:32:13.853
Is everybody okay?

01:32:22.695 --> 01:32:24.364
Oh, my boys.

01:32:25.031 --> 01:32:28.118
How much do you think
we should charge them for this?

01:32:35.875 --> 01:32:36.918
Dad?

01:32:43.425 --> 01:32:45.135
Dad, are you all right?

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:54.352
One thing about livin' in Santa Carla
I never could stomach...

01:32:55.562 --> 01:32:57.605
All the damn vampires.
