02:19.700 --> 02:21.265
My sister Kate learned to swim

02:21.300 --> 02:24.540
when most babies were still
in their playpens.

02:24.575 --> 02:27.145
I adore her. Everybody does.

02:27.180 --> 02:30.980
I wanted to name her after Saint Gobain
the virgin beekeeper.

02:31.340 --> 02:34.700
But mother, Mrs. Flax,
thought I was a little peculiar.

02:34.735 --> 02:38.260
I don't agree.

03:04.980 --> 03:08.820
Mrs. Flax doesn't believe
in ritual or tradition.

03:24.940 --> 03:28.780
Maybe.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.705
I think so.

03:34.740 --> 03:38.540
I'd wanted to repent since
I saw a girl with ashes on her forehead

03:38.575 --> 03:42.340
cross herself and chant Hail Marys
before a spelling bee.

03:44.140 --> 03:47.980
Charlotte, we're Jewish.

03:55.460 --> 03:56.745
What's this?

03:56.780 --> 03:59.260
Cheeseball pick-me-ups
and miniature franks.

03:59.295 --> 04:03.100
And for desert, marshmallow-kabobs.

04:05.100 --> 04:08.900
A word about Mrs. Flax and food.
The word is hors d'oeuvres.

04:09.940 --> 04:11.980
"Fun Finger Foods"
is her main source book.

04:12.015 --> 04:14.025
That's all she cooks.

04:14.060 --> 04:17.860
Anything more, she says,
is too big a commitment.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.380
It's Fred. How do I look?

04:26.415 --> 04:28.585
Like a woman about to sin.

04:28.620 --> 04:32.420
Good. Exactly the look I was hoping for

04:33.460 --> 04:37.145
Don't wait up.

04:37.180 --> 04:41.020
Mrs. Flax is dating her boss.

04:56.220 --> 04:59.660
That means we'll be moving soon.

04:59.695 --> 05:03.460
Wait a minute.

05:05.740 --> 05:09.580
Not only am I not going on this trip
but you're taking another woman?

05:12.060 --> 05:15.900
Honey, she's not just another woman.
She's my wife.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.105
We've moved 18 times.

05:20.140 --> 05:23.105
It gets easy to read the signs.

05:40.580 --> 05:43.425
I feel I've wasted half my life in cars

05:43.460 --> 05:47.300
I try to be charitable, looking
after Kate and not killing mother.

05:48.180 --> 05:52.020
But whoever heard the word of God
going 70 mph on the intyerstate.

06:02.580 --> 06:06.020
President Kennedy arrived
in Hyannis Port today from Washington.

06:06.055 --> 06:09.860
There to greet him
as his helicopter touched down

06:15.180 --> 06:17.980
I don't think
He wanted those gifts they gave Him.

06:18.015 --> 06:21.545
Frankenstein and birds?

06:21.580 --> 06:24.260
No, sweetheart,
the 3 wise men brought the baby

06:24.295 --> 06:28.100
Jesus, Frankincense and Myrrh.

06:29.540 --> 06:32.300
I know about these thing
but I choose to believe something else.

06:32.335 --> 06:34.380
I have an idea. How about some fudge?

06:34.415 --> 06:37.545
Do you want to make fudge?

06:37.580 --> 06:41.380
I can't do anything until
I have everything the way it was.

06:42.540 --> 06:45.740
The point of moving is
so things can be different.

06:45.775 --> 06:48.500
I hate waking up
and not knowing where I am.

06:48.535 --> 06:50.985
I'll put a sign above your bed saying:

06:51.020 --> 06:54.460
"Good morning. You're in East Port.
Have a nice day."

06:54.495 --> 06:56.865
I liked living in Oklahoma.

06:56.900 --> 06:59.400
You'll love it here
when you got used to it.

06:59.435 --> 07:01.900
And when you get used to it,
we'll move again.

07:01.935 --> 07:04.105
Life is change.

07:04.140 --> 07:07.940
Death is dwelling on the past
or staying in one place too long.

07:11.700 --> 07:14.700
Remind me to get you
a decent pair of shoes.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.677
I don't want any.

07:15.712 --> 07:16.585
Don't be ridiculous.

07:16.620 --> 07:18.480
All women want new shoes.

07:18.515 --> 07:20.340
But those are from him.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.665
Him? Oh, him.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.780
Charlotte says he'll visit one day.

07:24.815 --> 07:26.825
How will he know we're here?

07:26.860 --> 07:29.060
The one thing
you can rely on about your father

07:29.095 --> 07:32.900
is that he can't be relied on.

07:34.620 --> 07:38.000
I only have one memory of my father.

07:38.035 --> 07:41.380
At least, I think it was my father.

07:50.900 --> 07:54.740
Honey, it's an eclipse. Put these on.

08:07.300 --> 08:11.140
One day he'll come back.
I just hope he can find us.

08:11.820 --> 08:15.660
Dear God, please,
don't let us be leaving right away.

08:16.100 --> 08:18.520
Please let me stop lying all the time.

08:18.555 --> 08:20.940
Please don't let me fall
in love so much.

08:20.975 --> 08:23.820
Please let someone fall in love back.

08:23.855 --> 08:26.660
And please send me a sign.

08:26.695 --> 08:30.500
Amen.

08:51.220 --> 08:55.060
"Maintenance man
for apartment house or hotel."

08:55.340 --> 08:59.180
"Experienced mechanic.
Sheet metal worker."

09:02.060 --> 09:05.020
You drive like old people make love.

09:05.055 --> 09:07.945
Mom, I'm only fifteen. I get nervous.

09:07.980 --> 09:11.780
Driving is one of a woman's
most important skills.

09:11.820 --> 09:14.100
You're lucky I taught you early.

09:14.135 --> 09:16.545
This sounds good.

09:16.580 --> 09:20.060
"Bright, personable,
cheerful, young secretary

09:20.095 --> 09:23.060
required by small law firm."

09:23.095 --> 09:23.985
Why are you signaling?

09:24.020 --> 09:27.860
The turn is 2 miles away.
Just pull over here.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.345
Step on it!

09:29.380 --> 09:33.220
Blow it out your ear!

09:49.100 --> 09:51.625
Johnny Angel

09:51.660 --> 09:55.460
You're an angel to me

09:55.540 --> 09:58.700
I just wondered
if you got moved in all right.

09:58.735 --> 10:01.985
Yeah, we moved in fine.

10:02.020 --> 10:05.520
I'm Joe Peretti. I work up the hill.

10:05.555 --> 10:09.020
So if you need anything done, ma'am...

10:09.980 --> 10:13.065
"Ma'am?"

10:13.100 --> 10:16.680
What exactly is up the hill,
Mr. Peretti?

10:16.715 --> 10:20.260
The convent.
Protectors of the Blessed Souls.

10:20.660 --> 10:24.140
This is a sign. Thank you, God.
This is a real sign.

10:24.175 --> 10:27.505
Our nearest neighbours are nuns?

10:27.540 --> 10:31.380
I suppose you think
this is divine providence.

10:31.415 --> 10:35.020
You know, there is one small thing.

10:35.055 --> 10:36.540
That porch swing up there.

10:36.575 --> 10:38.505
I can't reach it.

10:38.540 --> 10:42.340
Okay. I'll take a look.

10:51.700 --> 10:55.540
So, Joe, how old did you say you were?

10:59.100 --> 11:00.825
26 and cute as a button.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.700
Too bad you want to be a nun.

11:05.620 --> 11:09.460
I think you might be old enough
for a boyfriend now.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.585
If I'm old enough,
maybe you're too old.

11:12.620 --> 11:16.460
Don't be ridiculous.
A real woman is never too old.

12:37.780 --> 12:41.620
Please, God, don't let me fall in love
and want to do disgusting things.

12:49.260 --> 12:53.060
Dear God, I love the way he throws.

13:06.460 --> 13:10.300
Come on.

13:12.140 --> 13:15.940
I'm taking my fiancÃ©e to lunch.

13:16.060 --> 13:19.900
I expect you to be here when I return.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.060
How are those depositions coming?

13:23.095 --> 13:26.900
They'll be ready.

13:28.620 --> 13:32.460
Assholes.

13:42.140 --> 13:44.065
Do you like your new boss?

13:44.100 --> 13:46.345
No, I don't. Did you make the list?

13:46.380 --> 13:49.660
Kate needs a swimsuit,
I need notebooks, pens and underwear.

13:49.695 --> 13:51.145
I have 30 minutes for lunch.

13:51.180 --> 13:54.980
After we get the shoes,
I'll give you money to buy the rest.

13:55.340 --> 13:57.260
I want red ones. Bright red ones.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.277
With a red strap.

13:59.312 --> 14:01.225
I don't need any.

14:01.260 --> 14:05.100
Charlotte, you're starting school
on Monday and those boots aren't.

14:05.900 --> 14:09.700
What's wrong with them?
Everything.

14:16.660 --> 14:19.460
I'll be right with you.

14:19.495 --> 14:22.260
Hail Mary, full of grace.

14:30.940 --> 14:32.745
You must be Mrs. Flax.

14:32.780 --> 14:36.620
Joseph told us that a nice
Jewish family were our new neighbours.

14:37.220 --> 14:39.545
Welcome to East Port.

14:39.580 --> 14:42.500
Oh, God, please
let Mrs. Flax control herself.

14:42.535 --> 14:45.420
You're still a perfect seven,
Reverend Mother.

14:45.455 --> 14:48.460
You know, most women's feet get bigger.

14:48.495 --> 14:50.717
Only if they marry.

14:50.752 --> 14:52.905
Your feet swell.

14:52.940 --> 14:55.180
During pergnancy your feet swell.

14:55.215 --> 14:57.105
How could she?

14:57.140 --> 15:00.265
Mine got swollen during pregnancy.

15:00.300 --> 15:04.140
Mother, how could you say that?
She's a holy vessel.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.580
What a lovely red shoe.

15:08.615 --> 15:11.305
Thank you.

15:11.340 --> 15:13.225
Where are you from?

15:13.260 --> 15:16.825
I used to live in South Dakota myself.

15:16.860 --> 15:20.700
Can you imagine trying to keep kosher
in South Dakota?

15:21.380 --> 15:25.180
I can't imagine keeping kosher anywhere.

15:26.980 --> 15:30.780
Will that be all, Reverend Mother?
Only one new addition?

15:31.580 --> 15:35.420
Every year, fewer and fewer of us now.

15:35.540 --> 15:38.065
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Flax.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.500
I hope you enjoy living in East Port.

15:41.535 --> 15:42.865
Yes, dear?

15:42.900 --> 15:46.740
I wanted to ask what color her bra was
and if she always had pure thoughts.

15:50.060 --> 15:53.900
Good-bye.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.540
She's got a pair she likes.
What about you?

16:20.575 --> 16:24.380
I don't need any.

16:27.980 --> 16:31.820
Nice boots.

16:34.300 --> 16:37.180
Maybe we'll meet at
Parent/Teacher night.

16:37.215 --> 16:41.020
Maybe we will.

16:41.780 --> 16:45.620
I'd like that.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.940
Come on, Miss Katydid,
you'll be late for registration.

17:02.900 --> 17:06.740
'Bye, Sergeant.
'Bye, fish head.

17:12.500 --> 17:16.339
Well, well,
look who's driving the school bus.

17:21.260 --> 17:25.099
Why, Charlotte,
I believe you're blushing.

17:45.740 --> 17:48.820
Come on.
Don't make such a big deal about it.

17:48.855 --> 17:51.420
Put it in your mouth and smoke it.

17:51.455 --> 17:53.825
I'll throw up all over.

17:53.860 --> 17:56.820
How was your date
with Scott Jones, Mary?

17:56.855 --> 17:58.625
He's an animal.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.105
So, you had a good time?

18:00.140 --> 18:03.180
We had oral sex by the railway trestle.

18:03.215 --> 18:06.220
I love it when they groan. Don't you?

18:06.255 --> 18:08.500
You're going get into trouble.

18:08.535 --> 18:12.340
I know. I can't wait.

18:15.060 --> 18:18.720
The bell rang five minutes ago.

18:18.755 --> 18:22.380
If she tells my mother, I'm dead.

18:43.780 --> 18:47.580
Noree?
Here.

18:50.380 --> 18:53.385
We have a new student today,
Charlotte Flax.

18:53.420 --> 18:56.340
I'm sure you'll do your best
to make her feel welcome.

18:56.375 --> 19:00.180
Charlotte, right down there.

19:00.940 --> 19:04.780
Charlotte... Flax, right?

19:20.460 --> 19:24.300
Talk to me, Joe. Please, talk to me.

19:24.660 --> 19:28.020
So, how do you like the house?

19:28.055 --> 19:31.860
Sorry?

19:34.260 --> 19:36.300
How do you like the house?

19:36.335 --> 19:38.157
I hate the house.

19:38.192 --> 19:39.945
I was born there.

19:39.980 --> 19:42.380
I love that house.
You were?

19:42.415 --> 19:44.745
Under the kitchen table.

19:44.780 --> 19:48.140
God strike me down,
that's as good as a manger.

19:48.175 --> 19:51.980
Give me strength not to sit on his lap.

19:53.700 --> 19:57.540
So was that you who carved
"Red Sox" on the door?

19:58.380 --> 20:00.440
That was my room.

20:00.475 --> 20:02.465
I'm in his room.

20:02.500 --> 20:06.300
When my mother died, I sat on my bed
for two days holding her sweater.

20:06.420 --> 20:10.180
I didn't care about anything,
not even the Red Sox.

20:10.215 --> 20:12.145
I'm going to burn in hell for sure.

20:12.180 --> 20:16.020
He's talking about his dead mother
and I'm wishing he was undoing my dress.

20:24.420 --> 20:28.260
That'll be Carrie. She sells cosmetics.

20:28.620 --> 20:32.420
She's going to love my mom.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.265
I was wondering...

20:42.300 --> 20:46.140
What do people do here on the weekends?

20:47.420 --> 20:51.260
Sunday's my day off.
Sometimes I go fishing.

20:52.140 --> 20:53.785
Really?

20:53.820 --> 20:55.945
I love to fish.

20:55.980 --> 20:59.820
Well, sometimes
I just sit by the water and think.

21:02.100 --> 21:05.545
That sounds great too.

21:05.580 --> 21:08.265
Maybe you and your sister...

21:08.300 --> 21:12.140
Well, Kate's actually scared
of the water.

21:12.460 --> 21:16.260
But I'd love to.

21:19.260 --> 21:23.100
Well, I drive right by here
on my way to the cliff so...

21:23.980 --> 21:25.380
What time?

21:25.415 --> 21:26.745
Seven.

21:26.780 --> 21:29.820
Okay. That sounds great.

21:29.855 --> 21:32.860
Okay, I'll wait for you.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.465
Know your colors and your fabrics.

21:44.500 --> 21:47.120
That's what I tell all my little girls.

21:47.155 --> 21:49.705
Honey, I would kill to have your hair.

21:49.740 --> 21:53.460
Swimming's fine for you figure,
but it damages your hair.

21:53.495 --> 21:55.460
Got anything for sharks and jellyfish?

21:55.495 --> 21:57.465
She means body grease.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.265
She's going to swim the English Channel.

22:00.300 --> 22:04.100
Well, I'm not sure I have exactly
what you're looking for... but try this.

22:08.020 --> 22:11.860
It was meant for crow's-feet,
but it never caught on.

22:11.940 --> 22:15.780
You are finished.

22:15.820 --> 22:19.620
Try the other side.

22:20.300 --> 22:23.780
Tell me about
that caretaker at the convent.

22:23.815 --> 22:27.260
You mean Joey?
Is he handsome or is he handsome?

22:27.295 --> 22:28.105
In high school...

22:28.140 --> 22:31.820
no one could touch the golden boy
on a football field.

22:31.855 --> 22:35.340
Then in the middle of
his senior year he lost it.

22:35.375 --> 22:37.785
He couldn't run to save his life.

22:37.820 --> 22:41.660
His girlfriend had just left town,
kind of sudden.

22:42.780 --> 22:46.620
My theory? I believe there's a little
Joey Junior walking around.

22:46.780 --> 22:50.620
I'd chase him myself if
I wasn't married to a real son-of-a-gun

22:52.300 --> 22:56.140
Joey, Joey, Joey, entering a convent
for the sin of getting a girl pregnant.

22:56.980 --> 22:59.900
A penitent man.
Makes me love you even more.

22:59.935 --> 23:03.740
You have very special eyes.

23:05.100 --> 23:08.580
Only you and Liz Taylor
can get away with those eyebrows.

23:08.615 --> 23:12.420
Let's put some color on you.

23:13.420 --> 23:17.260
This one's planning to be a nun.

23:24.620 --> 23:28.420
A difficult age.
All Charlotte's ages are difficult.

23:32.300 --> 23:36.140
What's so special about
this Parent/Teacher night?

23:36.180 --> 23:37.665
You read the invitation.

23:37.700 --> 23:41.100
Community begins in the classroom.
I am your mother.

23:41.135 --> 23:44.940
It is my job o supervise your education.

23:45.060 --> 23:47.820
There's so little of it left.
What took you so long?

23:47.855 --> 23:49.917
We going to play my favorite game?

23:49.952 --> 23:51.980
Who's the worst mother in the world?

23:52.015 --> 23:53.380
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

23:53.415 --> 23:57.180
Who could it be? Me?

23:59.300 --> 24:01.105
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

24:01.140 --> 24:04.625
You stop being a little bitch
for an hour or two

24:04.660 --> 24:07.980
and I won't knock the religion
of your choice for a week.

24:08.015 --> 24:11.820
Deal.

24:11.900 --> 24:15.220
Who's that?
My history teacher. He's nice.

24:15.255 --> 24:16.985
He's an asshole.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.380
You haven't spoken to him yet.

24:19.415 --> 24:21.705
I don't need to speak to him.

24:21.740 --> 24:25.540
He's driving an Edsel, for Christ sake.

24:32.020 --> 24:34.900
We can't beat Stockton's Little League
if you don't release him.

24:34.935 --> 24:38.740
Agendas are here and there's refreshments...

24:40.820 --> 24:44.545
Hi. I'm glad you came tonight.

24:44.580 --> 24:48.380
You have 2 weeks, I need one day.
I'll think about it.

24:48.460 --> 24:52.260
Hi. Is your mom here?

24:58.900 --> 25:02.740
How are you?
Good. I'm even better now.

25:03.780 --> 25:05.025
Are any of these yours?

25:05.060 --> 25:08.860
No. Mine are grown and long gone.

25:10.220 --> 25:14.020
Where's Mrs. Landsky tonight?

25:14.100 --> 25:16.140
She's long gone too.

25:16.175 --> 25:19.097
Oh, you're a widower.

25:19.132 --> 25:22.020
No, she's just gone.

25:22.055 --> 25:25.545
Some punch?

25:25.580 --> 25:29.420
She just up and left one day right
in the middle of vacuuming.

25:29.860 --> 25:33.660
Didn't even switch the damn thing off.

25:41.580 --> 25:44.225
Is there a Mr. Flax?

25:44.260 --> 25:47.140
No. He too made a rather sudden
and unexpected departure.

25:47.175 --> 25:48.265
Was he vacuuming?

25:48.300 --> 25:50.700
No. I was in labor with Charlotte.

25:50.735 --> 25:53.065
Yeah, and to add insult to injury

25:53.100 --> 25:56.665
the son-of-a-bitch stole
my car to leave in.

25:56.700 --> 26:00.220
A red Buick convertible
with white sidewall tires.

26:00.255 --> 26:02.265
It still pisses me off.

26:02.300 --> 26:04.540
It's obvious it means a lot to you.

26:04.575 --> 26:05.305
The first time

26:05.340 --> 26:09.100
I got behind the wheel of that car
I thought, "This is heaven."

26:09.135 --> 26:10.025
Cars mean freedom.

26:10.060 --> 26:13.900
If you hate a place, you can get in
your car, poof, you're gone.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.680
So your first love was a Buick.

26:17.715 --> 26:19.820
Yeah, before I met my husband.

26:19.855 --> 26:22.537
Big mistake. One of many.

26:22.572 --> 26:25.185
Are we talking cars or men?

26:25.220 --> 26:29.020
I don't know.
Both have taken me for a ride.

26:33.660 --> 26:37.500
I try not to get too involved with
women before the World Series starts

26:42.100 --> 26:45.940
but for you I'd make an exception.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.585
Is that a compliment?

26:48.620 --> 26:52.460
Oh, yes. I would really
like to know you a whole lot better.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.840
So call me Lou.

26:56.875 --> 26:59.860
So, Lou, call me.

27:00.740 --> 27:03.460
How about Sunday? I'm free all day.

27:03.495 --> 27:06.380
How about breakfast?

27:06.415 --> 27:08.385
Great.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.225
I'll bring bagels.

27:10.260 --> 27:14.100
I'll be there.
So will I.

27:15.220 --> 27:17.100
Do you see that woman?

27:17.135 --> 27:19.345
That's my mom.

27:19.380 --> 27:23.220
But when I grow up
I want to be just like yours.

27:26.220 --> 27:30.020
Mary, you already are.

27:35.700 --> 27:37.705
I'll make real sandwiches.

27:37.740 --> 27:41.540
Big ones a man can sink his teeth into
and use both hands to hold them.

27:44.300 --> 27:47.660
He's late.
Oh, God, please don't let him forget.

27:47.695 --> 27:50.065
Be as patient as Saint Bridget,

27:50.100 --> 27:53.180
lady in waiting to
Queen Blanche of Namur.

27:53.215 --> 27:55.797
It's after seven, Charlotte. He's late.

27:55.832 --> 27:58.345
I won't start the day with an argument.

27:58.380 --> 28:01.420
I'll tally up my evil thoughts
for the week and ignore her.

28:01.455 --> 28:05.220
When a man's late,
it's time to clear the decks.

28:26.220 --> 28:30.020
What?

28:33.740 --> 28:37.580
Forget it! Never mind!

28:45.580 --> 28:49.380
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

28:50.540 --> 28:54.380
Or don't do anything I would.

29:11.180 --> 29:14.980
Rachel Flax.

29:26.980 --> 29:29.900
I want to scream
out the window like a maniac.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.785
"I'm running away
with the caretaker man!"

29:32.820 --> 29:36.100
My speedometer is broken.
I'm trying not to drive too fast.

29:36.135 --> 29:39.900
After my mom nothing seems fast.

29:40.340 --> 29:42.860
Now my lips are touching his.

29:42.895 --> 29:45.345
She seems like a nice person.

29:45.380 --> 29:49.180
Oh, yeah, she is. And a wonderful mom.

30:00.180 --> 30:03.065
Gott in Himmel.

30:03.100 --> 30:05.900
I never saw anybody
treat a bagel this way.

30:05.935 --> 30:07.265
Where were you raised?

30:07.300 --> 30:11.140
Believe it or not,
my parents owned a kosher bakery.

30:11.175 --> 30:13.025
They made me crazy, of course.

30:13.060 --> 30:16.280
The night that I ran away
I stood in the kitchen

30:16.315 --> 30:19.500
cigarette in one hand,
ham sandwich in another.

30:19.535 --> 30:20.785
Why were you running away?

30:20.820 --> 30:24.660
I had my high school diploma,
my first pay check. Why stay?

30:24.695 --> 30:26.145
Hi. 'Bye.

30:26.180 --> 30:29.000
Wait a minute.

30:29.035 --> 30:31.820
'Bye, Mom.

30:37.180 --> 30:38.785
Where'd you meet your husband?

30:38.820 --> 30:42.620
In a writing class. He liked my poems.

30:43.980 --> 30:46.545
So we moved into a one-room apartment.

30:46.580 --> 30:50.420
It was a dump, but standing
on a chair you could see Lake Michigan.

30:50.980 --> 30:54.100
It must have been tough when he left,
raising a kid on your own.

30:54.135 --> 30:57.940
I coped.

31:01.740 --> 31:04.100
Who was Kate's father?

31:04.135 --> 31:06.460
Are you always this nosy?

31:06.495 --> 31:07.865
Small-town boy.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.700
I like to know other people's business.
Do you mind?

31:10.735 --> 31:14.140
No. When I mind, you'll know.
It'll be obvious.

31:14.175 --> 31:16.185
So who was he?

31:16.220 --> 31:18.505
I never caught his name.

31:18.540 --> 31:22.340
He was in St. Louis for a swim meet.
He had Olympic aspirations.

31:22.740 --> 31:24.585
You were on the same team?

31:24.620 --> 31:27.545
No, I was the maid in his hotel.

31:27.580 --> 31:31.420
One night...
I delivered more than his towels.

31:36.140 --> 31:37.740
You're a hell of a woman.

31:37.775 --> 31:39.865
I know.

31:39.900 --> 31:43.640
It's been a memorable breakfast.
- I'm glad you like it.

31:43.675 --> 31:47.380
I didn't say I liked it.
But I'll never forget it.

31:47.900 --> 31:51.740
I'm sorry. No offense.
- None taken.

31:53.860 --> 31:57.660
What do you want to do?
We've got all day.

32:02.700 --> 32:06.540
You want to go out?

32:16.020 --> 32:19.860
Do you want to go out?

32:20.540 --> 32:24.265
Not really. No.

32:24.300 --> 32:26.940
Do you want to go out?

32:26.975 --> 32:30.780
I'm fine.

32:32.140 --> 32:34.540
Tell me about the nuns in the convent.

32:34.575 --> 32:36.940
Do they wear underwear in the shower?

32:36.975 --> 32:38.865
I don't believe I said that.

32:38.900 --> 32:42.385
I'm always too embarrassed
to take a shower after gym.

32:42.420 --> 32:46.260
Mary O'Brien dances naked, screaming
about her boyfriend's quivering loins.

32:47.420 --> 32:51.220
Shut up, Charlotte. Shut up.

32:51.255 --> 32:55.060
The boat's down there.

32:55.420 --> 32:57.740
Please, God,
let him throw me on the ground

32:57.775 --> 33:01.580
and make another Joey Junior.

33:05.020 --> 33:06.065
You okay?

33:06.100 --> 33:09.940
I'm fine, thanks.

33:17.100 --> 33:20.940
I do want to be good and virtuous,
but it isn't easy.

33:42.980 --> 33:46.740
Do you want to bait your hook
or shall I do it?

33:46.775 --> 33:50.500
Mary, Mother of God,
he still wants to fish.

33:56.260 --> 33:58.840
What's funny?
You're a sexy guy.

33:58.875 --> 34:01.420
Do you have to look surprised?

34:01.455 --> 34:03.865
I am surprised.

34:03.900 --> 34:07.340
Sometimes age his its compensations.

34:07.375 --> 34:10.304
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

34:10.340 --> 34:14.060
It's been ages since I've felt his good

34:14.094 --> 34:15.496
How long?

34:15.532 --> 34:16.864
Too long.

34:16.900 --> 34:19.580
You haven't been with other women?

34:19.614 --> 34:20.905
You're lying.

34:20.940 --> 34:23.860
I am?
Trust me, I know about these things.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.917
Okay.

34:25.952 --> 34:27.646
I'm lying

34:27.681 --> 34:29.304
I don't care.

34:29.340 --> 34:30.905
Well, that's a shame.

34:30.940 --> 34:34.219
Lying's my main thing. I'll miss it.

34:34.255 --> 34:36.117
In my experience...

34:36.152 --> 34:37.945
which is considerable.

34:37.980 --> 34:41.139
Men lie about everything.
- But women don't?

34:41.175 --> 34:44.300
I don't know about women, but I don't.

34:44.340 --> 34:47.824
But from me you expect it.
Absolutely.

34:47.860 --> 34:51.699
Well, when you expect the worst
from people they usually deliver.

34:52.020 --> 34:54.940
Are you always aggressive after sex?

34:54.975 --> 34:58.797
You call this aggressive?

34:58.832 --> 35:02.620
Oh, yeah. Hey, this is fun.

35:03.180 --> 35:06.860
Can we do it again Friday?
You don't waste time do you?

35:06.895 --> 35:07.865
Life's too short.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.700
I'm sorry I got old before I noticed.

35:10.735 --> 35:13.065
I'm never growing old.

35:13.100 --> 35:15.140
Time catches up. What can you do?

35:15.175 --> 35:18.940
Keep moving.

35:31.340 --> 35:32.940
I had a good time.

35:32.975 --> 35:36.345
Me too.

35:36.380 --> 35:40.220
Kiss me, Joe. Please kiss me.

35:41.820 --> 35:45.660
Good night.

36:23.180 --> 36:25.460
How was your date?

36:25.495 --> 36:27.225
Fine.

36:27.260 --> 36:29.020
We had a good time.

36:29.055 --> 36:31.065
Great. So did we.

36:31.100 --> 36:33.345
I hate when she does that.

36:33.380 --> 36:35.265
She's trying to break the world record.

36:35.300 --> 36:39.100
If she's not up in 10 seconds,
call an ambulance.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.380
When will you see him again?

36:41.415 --> 36:43.545
I don't know.

36:43.580 --> 36:45.905
If I were you, I'd go easy.

36:45.940 --> 36:48.065
I know you're planning a celibate life,

36:48.100 --> 36:51.900
but that might be tough
with half my genes.

36:52.340 --> 36:56.180
Yuck! Five seconds off.

37:12.820 --> 37:14.505
I must stop having impure thoughts.

37:14.540 --> 37:18.340
I don't take the bus to school anymore,
but that doesn't help.

37:19.820 --> 37:23.100
Maybe if I discover why I love him,
the sick feeling will go away.

37:23.135 --> 37:25.900
I love him.
He has the most beautiful skin.

37:25.935 --> 37:28.825
He wears moccasins in winter

37:28.860 --> 37:32.700
even though his feet must feel like ice.

37:41.380 --> 37:45.180
Trick or treat!

37:47.060 --> 37:50.900
Yes, I've got wonderful prizes for you.

37:52.180 --> 37:53.905
Toothpaste?

37:53.940 --> 37:56.020
All right, it's magic toothpaste.

37:56.055 --> 37:58.345
Magic toothpaste.

37:58.380 --> 38:02.220
Wait, wait! Miss Kate! In the house.

38:02.380 --> 38:05.380
Come on, Mom!
Put your little goldfish lips in the house.

38:05.415 --> 38:09.180
'Bye!

38:14.220 --> 38:18.020
They're big.

38:19.500 --> 38:23.340
All right, team! Yeah!

38:29.420 --> 38:33.140
Swimmers meet! Quiet please!

38:33.175 --> 38:36.620
Swimmers on the block.

38:36.655 --> 38:40.420
Take your marks.

38:44.660 --> 38:46.160
An Esther Williams!

38:46.195 --> 38:47.625
What do I have?
Soap?

38:47.660 --> 38:51.460
Mrs. Flax! Coach Parker.
It's so nice to meet you!

38:51.980 --> 38:54.105
We are so proud of Kate.

38:54.140 --> 38:56.425
I think she has Olympic potential.

38:56.460 --> 38:58.860
That probably doesn't surprise you.
Not at all.

38:58.895 --> 39:00.860
Did she get it from you?
Not at all.

39:00.895 --> 39:04.077
Nice job.
Thanks, Coach.

39:04.112 --> 39:07.260
Hi, Mrs. Crain! 'Bye, coach!

39:07.295 --> 39:10.825
'Bye, dear!

39:10.860 --> 39:14.505
They're terrible.

39:14.540 --> 39:18.140
I said painting was my passion,
not that I was good.

39:18.175 --> 39:20.825
Girls, back me up here.

39:20.860 --> 39:24.700
Did either of you hear me
tell your mother I had talent?

39:25.500 --> 39:28.745
I rest my case.

39:28.780 --> 39:32.620
Now stop being a pain in the ass critic
and pose for me.

39:33.660 --> 39:35.180
If you paint me like that, you're dead.

39:35.215 --> 39:36.745
Trust me.

39:36.780 --> 39:39.265
Girls, follow me.

39:39.300 --> 39:43.100
Already I feel inspired.

39:43.340 --> 39:47.140
I'll show you where you're sleeping.

39:55.940 --> 39:57.545
Forgive my abruptness,

39:57.580 --> 40:00.100
but when the Muse calls,
the artist must jump.

40:00.135 --> 40:03.297
Good night.

40:03.332 --> 40:06.460
He's nuts-o.

40:18.980 --> 40:21.545
I did Sophia from memory.

40:21.580 --> 40:25.420
I never worked with a live one before.

40:26.060 --> 40:27.905
This is fun.

40:27.940 --> 40:31.740
Don't you think this is fun?

40:32.420 --> 40:34.385
Oh, Cleo, baby.

40:34.420 --> 40:38.260
That is not very regal.

41:24.780 --> 41:28.620
Sometimes I feel like you're the child
and I'm the grownup.

41:30.820 --> 41:34.620
I can't imagine being inside you.

41:36.380 --> 41:37.745
I can't imagine being anywhere

41:37.780 --> 41:41.620
you'd let me stay
for nine straight months.

42:03.180 --> 42:04.880
What's wrong with this picture?

42:04.915 --> 42:06.545
Compliments of Mrs. Landsky.

42:06.580 --> 42:09.300
It seems she froze Lou's meals
for the next decade.

42:09.335 --> 42:11.717
Good morning.

42:11.752 --> 42:14.065
What a morning!

42:14.100 --> 42:16.585
This is for you.
- Thank you.

42:16.620 --> 42:18.900
How are you? Did you weather the storm?

42:18.935 --> 42:22.740
Yeah. Fine, thanks.

42:26.220 --> 42:30.060
This is how you normally eat?

42:43.700 --> 42:47.465
The time is autumn, 1621.

42:47.500 --> 42:51.340
The place is Plymouth Plantation:
An English colony in Massachusetts.

42:53.900 --> 42:57.700
This is a harvest feast; a thanksgiving.

42:58.380 --> 43:02.220
The Englishmen have invited
their neighbors, the Indians.

43:03.620 --> 43:05.065
Oh, God.

43:05.100 --> 43:07.980
For games and contests of skill.

43:08.015 --> 43:11.465
Oh, dear God.

43:11.500 --> 43:15.160
What is it? What happened?

43:15.195 --> 43:22.260
The President's been shot!

43:22.295 --> 43:26.100
Benny, turn that off!

43:29.860 --> 43:32.425
Governor Connelly
was struck in the chest.

43:32.460 --> 43:36.260
Unconfirmed reports say the President
was hit in the head.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.745
That's an unconfirmed report.

43:37.780 --> 43:41.545
The President's wife was not hurt.

43:41.580 --> 43:45.385
She entered the hospital at her
husband's president Kennedy's side.

43:45.420 --> 43:49.260
A newsman said he was riding behind
the President in the parade.

43:49.295 --> 43:51.065
After the shots were fired,

43:51.100 --> 43:54.940
he looked up at the 6th floor
of the Texas Book Depository.

43:54.980 --> 43:58.180
He saw the rifle pulled back in.

43:58.215 --> 43:59.465
I want my father.

43:59.500 --> 44:02.540
Please God, I want to talk to my father.

44:02.575 --> 44:05.757
20 feet away when it happened.

44:05.792 --> 44:07.926
Tell us exactly what you saw, sir.

44:07.961 --> 44:10.025
He was coming down the street.

44:10.060 --> 44:13.860
My 5-year-old and myself
were by ourselves on Palmer Street.

44:14.780 --> 44:16.900
I waved, and the m...

44:16.935 --> 44:18.025
The man...

44:18.060 --> 44:19.980
That's all right.

44:20.015 --> 44:21.705
Go ahead.

44:21.740 --> 44:24.140
As he was waving, a shot rang out.

44:24.175 --> 44:25.305
He slumped down.

44:25.340 --> 44:27.500
His wife reached up toward him.

44:27.535 --> 44:29.545
He was slumping down

44:29.580 --> 44:33.100
and the second shot went off
and knocked him down.

44:33.135 --> 44:34.585
Two shots?

44:34.620 --> 44:35.305
Did you see who...

44:35.340 --> 44:36.020
I did not see the man who did it.

44:36.055 --> 44:39.860
I'm sorry.

44:40.620 --> 44:43.945
I can't help more, but I won't forget.

44:43.980 --> 44:46.860
Here is a flash
from the Associated Press.

44:46.895 --> 44:48.105
Dateline: Dallas.

44:48.140 --> 44:51.500
Two priests who were
with the President say

44:51.535 --> 44:52.997
he is dead of bullet wounds.

44:53.032 --> 44:54.425
There is no confirmation.

44:54.460 --> 44:58.300
This is what we have on a flash basis
from the Associated Press.

44:58.700 --> 45:01.025
We have two men...

45:01.060 --> 45:04.580
who administered the last rites
of the Catholic Church to the President

45:04.615 --> 45:08.380
President Kennedy
has been assassinated. It's official.

45:08.460 --> 45:11.265
The President is dead.

45:11.300 --> 45:14.425
Women here in shock. Some have fainted.

45:14.460 --> 45:17.420
Two Secret Servicemen,
standing by the Emergency Room

45:17.455 --> 45:20.065
tears streaming down their faces.

45:20.100 --> 45:23.900
There's only one word to describe
the picture here and that's grief.

45:27.100 --> 45:30.345
It's official. It just came in:

45:30.380 --> 45:34.180
The President
of the United States is dead.

45:35.740 --> 45:39.580
It feels like there isn't a single
adult left on the entire planet.

45:45.260 --> 45:48.580
Oh, God, what are you doing?

45:48.615 --> 45:51.900
How could you let this happen?

45:55.420 --> 45:57.665
I miss my father.

45:57.700 --> 46:00.425
Is he watching television?

46:00.460 --> 46:04.300
Maybe he's in Brazil
and doesn't know what's happened.

46:40.780 --> 46:44.580
The old man who did this job
before me had Indian ways.

46:49.100 --> 46:51.945
He could stand so quiet.

46:51.980 --> 46:55.780
His heels together like a little dancer.

46:58.980 --> 47:02.780
The world's gone crazy.

47:55.420 --> 47:56.465
My Father, who art in Heaven...

47:56.500 --> 47:58.380
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done...

47:58.415 --> 47:59.825
Forgive us our trespasses

47:59.860 --> 48:01.545
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

48:01.580 --> 48:05.420
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

48:07.220 --> 48:11.060
In 1990 the space age will enter
it's 2nd phase

48:12.780 --> 48:15.580
and our hopes in it
to preserve the peace

48:15.615 --> 48:18.345
to make sure
that in this great new sea

48:18.380 --> 48:22.220
as on earth,
the United States is second to none.

48:29.900 --> 48:31.945
Everyone's crying about the President.

48:31.980 --> 48:35.060
I've become a fallen woman
and no one can tell.

48:35.095 --> 48:38.057
I've been as bad as I can be.

48:38.092 --> 48:41.020
I should be burned at the stake.

48:44.940 --> 48:47.180
Bless me, for I have sinned.

48:47.215 --> 48:49.060
And in a holy place.

48:49.095 --> 48:50.505
I kissed him.

48:50.540 --> 48:51.585
I will starve myself

48:51.620 --> 48:55.420
until I purge every sinful thought
about Joe from my soul.

49:05.500 --> 49:07.580
The saints never go unpunished.

49:07.615 --> 49:10.117
Joan of Arc burned at the stake.

49:10.152 --> 49:12.620
So what will you do to me, Lord?

49:12.655 --> 49:15.465
Flagellation? Mutilation?

49:15.500 --> 49:19.340
I bumped into Mr. Crain
leaving Sammy's house.

49:19.375 --> 49:20.677
That witch?

49:20.712 --> 49:21.945
Dinner!

49:21.980 --> 49:23.980
Think about it. Get back to me.

49:24.015 --> 49:24.705
He wants a baby.

49:24.740 --> 49:28.540
I bet he's trying a love potion.

49:28.980 --> 49:30.465
I wish I had trouble conceiving.

49:30.500 --> 49:33.340
I get pregnant
if I hang my clothes near a man's suit.

49:33.375 --> 49:37.180
Oh, Lord, no. Anything but that.

49:46.180 --> 49:48.900
No more fasting.
You're driving me crazy.

49:48.935 --> 49:50.025
I'm pregnant.

49:50.060 --> 49:52.940
Lord, how could you be so strict?

49:52.975 --> 49:56.185
Are you okay?

49:56.220 --> 50:00.060
Eat and get some rest
and we'll talk about this tomorrow.

50:04.605 --> 50:08.045
Mary didn't even kiss Joseph
and look what happened.

50:08.080 --> 50:11.845
Oh, Lord, what have I done?

50:22.645 --> 50:26.485
Can I talk to you?
Sure.

50:31.765 --> 50:35.565
Well?

50:42.725 --> 50:46.205
Hello? Is there anybody there?

50:46.240 --> 50:49.685
Just give me a second. I'm trying.

50:49.720 --> 50:51.810
I want to tell you.

50:51.845 --> 50:55.445
I may be pregnant
with the next Jewish-Italian messiah.

50:55.480 --> 50:58.050
Nothing.

50:58.085 --> 51:00.245
What is the matter with you?

51:00.280 --> 51:02.370
What is happening in your brain

51:02.405 --> 51:05.165
when you just sit there,
not moving, not speaking?

51:05.200 --> 51:08.965
What? What?

51:13.045 --> 51:16.725
Dad, you're the only one who can help
and you're never here.

51:16.760 --> 51:20.565
Where are you?

51:42.365 --> 51:43.490
Joe doesn't know where she is.

51:43.525 --> 51:47.365
She's angry. That's okay.
Blowing off steam, that's okay.

51:48.085 --> 51:49.765
Taking my car is not okay.

51:49.800 --> 51:51.810
That's going too far.

51:51.845 --> 51:54.685
Did she say that anything
was bothering her?

51:54.720 --> 51:55.650
I'm her mother.

51:55.685 --> 51:59.525
If something bothers her,
I'm the last person she'll tell.

51:59.765 --> 52:03.445
She's a teenager.
I'm amazed she talks at all.

52:03.480 --> 52:05.130
Where is she?

52:05.165 --> 52:08.370
Onward Christian soldiers.

52:08.405 --> 52:12.205
I want to lead a violent
and exciting life!

53:16.445 --> 53:20.285
Excuse me.
I seem to be having engine trouble.

53:20.565 --> 53:23.905
Who is it?
It's just a young girl.

53:23.940 --> 53:27.245
I'm a shepherd who's lost my flock.

53:27.280 --> 53:29.302
Your folks know where you are?

53:29.337 --> 53:31.290
They know exactly where I am.

53:31.325 --> 53:35.050
Especially my dad.
He's that kind of guy.

53:35.085 --> 53:38.705
Charlotte,
you're talking like a crazy person.

53:38.740 --> 53:42.325
I'm glad you're here,
but you don't need to stay.

53:42.360 --> 53:44.370
I'll always be here for you.

53:44.405 --> 53:47.225
Okay, I won't always be here for you.
Just sometimes.

53:47.260 --> 53:50.045
If I feel like it,
or if I'm in the neighborhood.

53:50.080 --> 53:52.770
She's doing this to turn my hair white.

53:52.805 --> 53:56.645
She has a problem
and she's too frightened to tell you.

53:56.885 --> 53:58.570
Why would she be frightened?

53:58.605 --> 54:01.490
Rachel, you can be a little abrasive!

54:01.525 --> 54:04.405
Even I'm scared
to talk to you sometimes!

54:04.440 --> 54:07.165
She's a kid! Don't ride her too hard.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.342
Don't lecture me on parenting!

54:09.377 --> 54:11.450
When she comes, I'm leaving.

54:11.485 --> 54:14.805
You wonder why she runs away?
Listen to yourself!

54:14.840 --> 54:15.410
Are we having a fight?
- Yeah!

54:15.445 --> 54:19.245
Why?
It relieves the tension!

54:21.085 --> 54:23.410
The discotheques, which are nightclubs

54:23.445 --> 54:27.285
have been very popular
in Europe and South America for years.

54:27.765 --> 54:30.130
Paris has about 100 of them.

54:30.165 --> 54:33.965
This is the frug, a combination of twist
and hitchhike.

54:34.005 --> 54:37.505
That's Killer Joe,
society's favorite dancing teacher.

54:37.540 --> 54:41.005
Killer Joe is also available
as a party stimulator.

54:50.405 --> 54:54.245
Do you like pancakes?

54:56.565 --> 55:00.405
A real, live father actually living in
the same house as his wife and kids.

55:01.085 --> 55:04.925
They're perfect. This is like TV.

55:05.965 --> 55:09.685
Maybe they'll adopt me.

55:09.720 --> 55:13.525
Do you like bacon?

55:13.805 --> 55:17.605
How about sausage?

55:18.485 --> 55:21.905
Toast?
I love toast.

55:21.940 --> 55:25.290
What's your name?
Sal.

55:25.325 --> 55:28.805
How could you lie?
They're being so nice.

55:28.840 --> 55:31.482
Sal, what?

55:31.517 --> 55:34.090
Val. Sal Val.

55:34.125 --> 55:35.930
My parents love rhymes.

55:35.965 --> 55:38.445
We stay up late at night
to think of new ones.

55:38.480 --> 55:42.245
Me, Mom, Dad,
Sis and my big brother, Al.

55:59.645 --> 56:03.370
She's all right. She's in New Haven.

56:03.405 --> 56:06.650
Could you give me
that address again, please?

56:06.685 --> 56:10.245
When I was little, we lived in Brazil
and owned a diamond mine.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.450
My father would always dance with me.

56:12.485 --> 56:16.290
We would dance and dance
in the middle of the jungle.

56:16.325 --> 56:20.165
And me and my sister,
she has these beautiful long, red curls

56:20.285 --> 56:23.585
and she wears
a jewelled crown on her head...

56:23.620 --> 56:26.850
What we would do is
we would make this pear wine.

56:26.885 --> 56:30.525
We'd take the bottles
and hang them from tree branches

56:30.560 --> 56:34.365
and write on them with diamond dust.

57:43.445 --> 57:47.285
Do you have any idea
what you've just put me through?

57:48.085 --> 57:49.885
I thought you were kidnapped!

57:49.920 --> 57:51.770
I thought you were dead!

57:51.805 --> 57:55.205
I thought you were chopped
into a million pieces.

57:55.240 --> 57:56.925
Go to your room! I can't talk to you.

57:56.960 --> 58:00.765
If I talk to you I'll kill you.

58:09.365 --> 58:13.205
I've had a little scotch. I'm real calm

58:17.365 --> 58:21.205
So, tell me, Charlotte, what's going on?

58:22.085 --> 58:25.330
You don't get it, Mom.
I think I'm pregnant.

58:25.365 --> 58:28.285
It may be God's child.
Are you trying to make me crazy?

58:28.320 --> 58:29.810
You wouldn't understand.

58:29.845 --> 58:33.005
You don't believe in religion,
or anything!

58:33.040 --> 58:34.570
Why were you running?

58:34.605 --> 58:37.010
Running away doesn't solve anything.

58:37.045 --> 58:40.685
No, I'm a grownup.
I don't run away. I move on.

58:40.720 --> 58:43.662
If something's bothering you, tell me!

58:43.697 --> 58:46.605
Maybe I can help. How bad can it be?

58:47.165 --> 58:51.005
Look, I'm really tired.
I just want to go to sleep, okay?

58:58.885 --> 59:00.410
Let me tell you something.

59:00.445 --> 59:03.125
Sometimes being the mother
really stinks.

59:03.160 --> 59:05.130
I don't always know what to do.

59:05.165 --> 59:08.965
You and Kate didn't come
with a book of instructions.

59:09.205 --> 59:12.530
If I can help you, tell me!

59:12.565 --> 59:16.365
I'll give it my best shot.
But that's all I can do.

59:30.845 --> 59:32.765
Where's Charlotte?
In her room.

59:32.800 --> 59:34.650
Somewhere on Mars.

59:34.685 --> 59:36.965
What did she tell you?
Nothing.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.242
Maybe her school counselor...

59:39.277 --> 59:41.450
Mrs Crain? Are you kidding?

59:41.485 --> 59:43.945
She couldn't find her ass
with both hands.

59:43.980 --> 59:46.370
Has she ever done anything
this strange before?

59:46.405 --> 59:49.805
She did get sent home
from school once before.

59:49.840 --> 59:52.130
For licking chalk off a blackboard.

59:52.165 --> 59:54.565
God, her tongue was yellow for a week.

59:54.600 --> 59:55.725
Why did she do that?

59:55.760 --> 59:56.490
I don't know.

59:56.525 --> 01:00:00.325
She read in a book that a Saint had
a vision after licking a wall.

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:05.765
The teacher sent home a note saying
Charlotte had psychological problems.

01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:10.965
What did you do?
We moved.

01:00:28.845 --> 01:00:30.605
I heard you ran away.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.405
You okay?

01:00:35.245 --> 01:00:38.685
You want to talk about it?

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.125
It's kind of complicated.

01:00:44.525 --> 01:00:48.325
I was worried.

01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:56.405
Joe, tell me about your girlfriend.

01:00:56.445 --> 01:00:59.450
My girlfriend?

01:00:59.485 --> 01:01:02.205
There's nothing to tell.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.285
Did you love her?

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.930
Yes, I did.

01:01:06.965 --> 01:01:10.765
But her family moved away
and I never saw her again.

01:01:12.725 --> 01:01:13.690
People in town talk

01:01:13.725 --> 01:01:17.565
as if something happened
between us, but it didn't.

01:01:22.525 --> 01:01:24.845
Joe, do you like babies?

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.770
Babies?

01:01:26.805 --> 01:01:29.730
Sure. I love babies.

01:01:29.765 --> 01:01:33.605
Some day I hope to have a whole bunch.

01:01:43.765 --> 01:01:47.565
Joan Ark?

01:01:53.765 --> 01:01:54.930
Hi, I'm Dr. Reynolds.

01:01:54.965 --> 01:01:57.885
How do you do? I just have...
First time here?

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.125
Yes, I just had a question.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.410
How's school?

01:02:00.445 --> 01:02:04.285
It's great.
I wish we had it on weekends.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:09.605
How old are you, Joan?
What? Eighteen.

01:02:10.365 --> 01:02:14.205
Is everything okay?
Is there anything inside me?

01:02:15.485 --> 01:02:19.325
Just get dressed
and come into my office.

01:02:32.365 --> 01:02:36.165
Joan, has your mother
even talked to you about sex?

01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:39.885
Please, God, I want to die!

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.770
Yeah, all the time.

01:02:42.805 --> 01:02:46.645
You know how babies are conceived?

01:02:47.565 --> 01:02:51.405
Oh, yeah. We talk about everything.
She's a wonderful mother.

01:02:54.285 --> 01:02:58.125
Then why do you think you're pregnant?
You're a virgin.

01:03:00.285 --> 01:03:04.125
I want to die, right now.

01:03:07.925 --> 01:03:11.125
So it's crazy to think
one kiss could get you pregnant.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.530
But how would I know?

01:03:12.565 --> 01:03:14.165
What about the Virgin Mary?

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.682
Look at Saint Perpetua?

01:03:15.717 --> 01:03:17.130
She transformed into a man,

01:03:17.165 --> 01:03:19.565
fought with the devil
and walked on his head.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.202
Weird things happen.

01:03:23.237 --> 01:03:26.805
Can you do me a favor?

01:03:28.765 --> 01:03:31.285
I need to go to Boston
on a jerk errand for my boss.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.610
Can you give the girls dinner?

01:03:33.645 --> 01:03:37.485
Yes! I got a great pot roast
in the freezer that Sophia left.

01:03:37.525 --> 01:03:38.290
Sound good?

01:03:38.325 --> 01:03:41.485
Antyhing hot and not shaped
like a star sounds good.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.330
Very funny. You know what?

01:03:43.365 --> 01:03:46.605
Your mouth sounds like your sister's.
I'm not pleased about that.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.805
The Crains
are having a party for New Year.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.330
Did you get an invitation?

01:03:51.365 --> 01:03:55.205
I'm going. Will you be there?
It's a costume party.

01:03:55.525 --> 01:03:58.225
What do you think?
Go.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.512
As what?
A goldfish!

01:04:01.547 --> 01:04:04.765
Well, you're a big help.

01:04:08.245 --> 01:04:12.085
As always, it was a pleasure.

01:04:12.325 --> 01:04:14.890
Oklahoma

01:04:14.925 --> 01:04:18.005
When the wind comes
sweeping down the plains

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.362
And the waving wheat
can sure smell sweet

01:04:21.397 --> 01:04:24.685
When the wind
comes right behind the rain

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.290
Oklahoma

01:04:27.325 --> 01:04:31.165
Every night my honey lamb and I...

01:04:58.445 --> 01:05:00.125
Where is everybody?

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.490
In here!

01:05:01.525 --> 01:05:05.365
Well, where's here... What is this?

01:05:06.645 --> 01:05:08.045
Hey, what's going on in here?

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.050
Young Esther Williams

01:05:09.085 --> 01:05:12.685
wanted to know what sleeping under
the sea would be like.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.205
Her wish being my command, hey, presto!

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.250
Wall-to-wall ocean.

01:05:17.285 --> 01:05:19.625
You're certifiable, you know that?

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:21.965
Then I'm with the right family.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.562
Let's show her.

01:05:25.597 --> 01:05:29.125
I'll do it.

01:05:29.685 --> 01:05:32.205
Oh, that is so neat.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.005
It's beautiful.

01:05:36.085 --> 01:05:38.605
So how's that? Sitting under the ocean.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.885
Flying fish and everything.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.090
It's good.

01:05:45.125 --> 01:05:47.130
Oh, dinner's ready!

01:05:47.165 --> 01:05:51.005
Let's eat. I'm so hungry.

01:06:06.445 --> 01:06:09.325
You did all that
in one evening and cooked too?

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.365
Charlotte we have to thank for dinner.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.690
A feast to put Sophia to shame.

01:06:14.725 --> 01:06:18.290
Where did you learn how to do this?
Home Economics.

01:06:18.325 --> 01:06:22.125
If the way to a man's heart is through
his stomach, there's hope for you yet.

01:06:22.885 --> 01:06:26.725
Personally, I don't think that's true.

01:06:26.765 --> 01:06:28.445
What do men care about?

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.170
Astroturf.

01:06:30.205 --> 01:06:31.965
According to Lou, it'll ruin baseball.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.690
Not to mention the civilized world.

01:06:33.725 --> 01:06:37.565
If you want a boyfriend,
you better start caring about it too.

01:06:39.005 --> 01:06:42.565
If you marry Lou, he can be our dad.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.690
We have a dad.

01:06:43.725 --> 01:06:46.645
I've never seen him.
He wouldn't make me an ocean.

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.605
Can we sleep over?

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.850
Please?
No!

01:06:49.885 --> 01:06:53.725
I'll think about it.

01:06:57.485 --> 01:06:59.245
Actually, you should have 2 forks.
Why?

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.130
You know what happened

01:07:01.165 --> 01:07:03.125
if we used the wrong fork
when I was a kid?

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.045
We had to stick them in the ground.

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.090
Even if the ground was frozen.

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:11.330
We called it the hardware garden.
Believe that?

01:07:11.365 --> 01:07:15.205
That's nothing. This kid's uncle died
and got sprinkled in the garden.

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:16.770
That's nothing.

01:07:16.805 --> 01:07:20.645
St. Maragaret of Antioch got eaten
by a dragon. And it burst!

01:07:21.245 --> 01:07:23.085
When I die,
I want to be sprinkled in the ocean.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.810
I could live inside a whale, like Jonah.

01:07:26.845 --> 01:07:30.125
What if the whale
doesn't have a living room

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.765
and you end up in a tuna fish sandwich?

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:33.810
Who are they?

01:07:33.845 --> 01:07:35.565
Once a man ate
at our table without his shirt.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.770
Like we were nudists!

01:07:37.805 --> 01:07:40.765
Oh, yeah! He yanked quarters
out of your ears!

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.650
Why'd he do that?

01:07:42.685 --> 01:07:46.005
I think so he wouldn't spill
his dinner on it.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.925
Cranberry sauce, please.
Some chicken?

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.810
What's happening?

01:07:49.845 --> 01:07:53.685
What usually happens when families
sit down to eat together. They talk!

01:07:54.365 --> 01:07:57.005
Cranberry sauce?
Chicken, anyone?

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.805
I do!
I'd love some!

01:08:07.165 --> 01:08:08.410
Wait.

01:08:08.445 --> 01:08:11.925
I never said you could do this.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:14.485
Let Kate get so attached.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.050
Is that terrible?

01:08:16.085 --> 01:08:18.569
This is not your family.

01:08:18.604 --> 01:08:20.685
If you want to be close, dial direct.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.484
But don't do it through my kids.

01:08:32.205 --> 01:08:36.045
Never in my life have I wanted to hit
a woman as much as I do you.

01:08:44.845 --> 01:08:48.685
When you are wrong
you're so wrong, it's scary!

01:09:01.005 --> 01:09:04.845
You've never done something
just to make somebody happy?

01:09:05.365 --> 01:09:07.010
What do you want?

01:09:07.045 --> 01:09:09.410
A little trust would be nice!

01:09:09.444 --> 01:09:13.085
And if you care about us,
would it kill you to show it?

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.729
What do you mean, us?

01:09:14.765 --> 01:09:18.165
Since when did you
and my kids become us?

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.410
You're just you, Lou.

01:09:19.444 --> 01:09:23.285
Me and the girls, that's us!

01:09:26.925 --> 01:09:30.765
I was talking about you and me.

01:09:44.484 --> 01:09:46.965
If you don't hurry,
it'll be New Year's Day!

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.902
You'll miss the party!

01:09:48.937 --> 01:09:50.805
Here's a little something.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.689
An arm!

01:09:51.725 --> 01:09:52.729
This year, Mom!

01:09:52.765 --> 01:09:55.165
All right. Here's a little more!

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.642
Are you ready?
This is boring!

01:09:57.677 --> 01:10:00.085
One, two, three, here I am!

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.570
You're a mermaid!

01:10:01.605 --> 01:10:05.445
No, I'm a lumberjack! A salesman!
You're beautiful!

01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:06.730
What do you think?

01:10:06.765 --> 01:10:08.450
If I'd had this when you were little

01:10:08.485 --> 01:10:12.325
I'd have done my ironing
and the diapers in it.

01:10:17.165 --> 01:10:20.010
Is this the mermaid bus?

01:10:20.045 --> 01:10:23.685
I can see it's mermaid time
to get into my mermaid car

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.650
and hit the mermaid road.

01:10:24.685 --> 01:10:27.445
Get the mermaid out of here.
Get my mermaid coat.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.405
Get my mermaid keys.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.650
Oh, my God.

01:10:31.685 --> 01:10:35.405
I don't think
I'll be fresh for the party.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.290
'Bye, Mom! Have fun!

01:10:38.325 --> 01:10:41.130
Have a good time!
I will!

01:10:41.165 --> 01:10:45.005
Good-bye, Mrs. Mermaid!
Good-bye, Junior Mermaids!

01:11:03.685 --> 01:11:06.765
Where's that handsome hunk of
a husband of yours?

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.450
Out front talking baseball.

01:11:09.485 --> 01:11:13.285
He bet $20 they couldn't name 3
players that batted over 400.

01:11:13.605 --> 01:11:17.170
Be right back.

01:11:17.205 --> 01:11:21.045
Ty Cobb, Joe Jackson, Naps Lajoie!
You owe me twenty bucks.

01:11:22.565 --> 01:11:25.685
Last day ever, end of this year.

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.805
Want to make some resolutions?

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.890
What are resolutions?

01:11:30.925 --> 01:11:34.165
They're sort of like wishes.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.405
I wish I could swim forever.

01:11:38.365 --> 01:11:41.370
I wish I'd known Anne Frank.

01:11:41.405 --> 01:11:45.245
And that I didn't lust
after Joe so much.

01:11:48.485 --> 01:11:52.325
Put that right here. We can use that.

01:11:52.445 --> 01:11:56.285
Why don't you stay and have a drink?
It's almost midnight.

01:11:59.165 --> 01:12:00.610
Hi, handsome.

01:12:00.645 --> 01:12:02.445
Nice caretaker's costume.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.245
You look nice.

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:10.245
It's time you and I had a little dance.

01:12:13.405 --> 01:12:14.850
Little Bo Peep.

01:12:14.885 --> 01:12:18.725
Can you help with these?

01:12:19.965 --> 01:12:22.410
Now, spin me.

01:12:22.445 --> 01:12:24.530
Watch my tail.
Sorry.

01:12:24.565 --> 01:12:27.805
I'm on pins and needles.
Did you win the $20?

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.045
What do you think?
I'm planning a pilgrimage.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.765
To Lourdes?
No, Cooperstown.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.370
Ask why.

01:12:34.405 --> 01:12:36.685
I'll tell you.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.930
I thought so.

01:12:38.965 --> 01:12:40.650
The Baseball Hall of Fame.

01:12:40.685 --> 01:12:44.525
Before I die,
there's 3 things I want from life.

01:12:45.965 --> 01:12:47.810
To touch Lou Gehrig's glove.

01:12:47.845 --> 01:12:51.685
To be in Florida for Spring Training.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.062
And to take you with me.

01:12:54.097 --> 01:12:56.131
Two out of three's not bad.

01:12:56.166 --> 01:12:58.130
Ask me in a couple months.

01:12:58.165 --> 01:12:59.565
If you're still here.
Exactly.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.165
Two minutes everybody!

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.965
Turn up the TV.

01:13:12.365 --> 01:13:15.045
What are we going to do?
- About what?

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.062
This relationship.
- What's wrong with it?

01:13:18.097 --> 01:13:21.045
It's stuck.
It has to move or it has to end.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.250
It can't just stay the same.

01:13:23.285 --> 01:13:26.325
Ultimatums
don't sit really well with me.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:30.165
Noisemakers?

01:13:31.765 --> 01:13:34.370
What if I asked you to marry me?

01:13:34.405 --> 01:13:35.925
I'd remind you
that you're still married.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.765
Then, I'd write. From New Mexico.

01:13:40.845 --> 01:13:44.685
Live with me.
- No.

01:13:45.685 --> 01:13:49.525
Seven... six... five... four...
three... two... one!

01:14:17.405 --> 01:14:21.245
Well, so far, 1964's a big drag.

01:14:21.605 --> 01:14:25.445
Are you coming home with me?

01:14:26.485 --> 01:14:30.065
Another night.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:33.645
Happy New Year's.

01:14:53.485 --> 01:14:57.285
I think my car's dead.

01:14:57.405 --> 01:15:01.245
Think so?

01:15:02.285 --> 01:15:05.045
Can you help me?

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:08.885
Good.

01:15:25.485 --> 01:15:28.045
Thanks for the ride, Joe.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.885
You bet.

01:15:42.405 --> 01:15:45.050
Sorry.

01:15:45.085 --> 01:15:46.530
Could you help me?

01:15:46.565 --> 01:15:50.405
I'm having trouble with this tail.

01:15:51.725 --> 01:15:55.525
Happy New Year.

01:16:02.765 --> 01:16:04.890
You kissed him?

01:16:04.925 --> 01:16:08.645
You kissed him?! How could you do that?

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.050
You let her?

01:16:10.085 --> 01:16:12.930
It was just a New Year's Eve kiss!

01:16:12.965 --> 01:16:16.725
You don't believe in New Year's.
I know.

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:18.325
What are you guys fighting about?

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.450
Nothing.
Everything.

01:16:20.485 --> 01:16:23.645
Get inside
before you freeze your butt off.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.805
Is Charlotte going to run away again?

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.890
God willing. Just kidding.

01:16:27.925 --> 01:16:31.125
Did you have a nice time?
Lovely, thank you.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.325
Staying there all night,
Miss Poopy Face?

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.170
Why did you let her?

01:16:36.205 --> 01:16:38.845
She kisses everybody,
don't you know that?

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.170
It doesn't mean you're special!

01:16:41.205 --> 01:16:45.045
It doesn't mean
she likes you or anything!

01:16:45.485 --> 01:16:49.325
She doesn't like anybody!

01:17:17.845 --> 01:17:21.685
Okay, Mom, you want to drive Lou away,
that's your business.

01:17:22.685 --> 01:17:26.525
You want Joe, that's war.

01:17:36.805 --> 01:17:40.645
You give me fever

01:17:43.485 --> 01:17:46.890
Fever

01:17:46.925 --> 01:17:49.005
Care to dance, Mrs. Flax?

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.845
Mrs. Polka Flax.

01:17:54.845 --> 01:17:57.045
She'll kill you if you wear that.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:00.885
Go back to your rocks.

01:18:09.165 --> 01:18:12.445
Act your age, not your shoe size.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.970
Who's this?

01:18:14.005 --> 01:18:15.890
Know your colors and your fabrics.

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:19.765
That's what I tell all my little girls.

01:18:23.885 --> 01:18:27.405
Shall I tell you a secret?

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.122
I'm in love with Joe.

01:18:29.157 --> 01:18:30.805
Do you kiss each other?

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.010
On the lips?

01:18:33.045 --> 01:18:35.325
Like Superman and Lois Lane?

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:39.165
What's it like?

01:18:39.725 --> 01:18:42.625
Sometimes when you kiss a person,
nothing happens.

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:45.525
It's like kissing your hand
or yourself in the mirror.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:48.045
But when you love someone...

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.410
I know. Chemicals.

01:18:50.445 --> 01:18:52.365
You mean chemistry, fish head.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.250
How do I look?

01:18:54.285 --> 01:18:57.965
Like someone drew all over you.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.810
Let's celebrate.
Cool.

01:19:00.845 --> 01:19:04.685
Never knew how much something... I care

01:19:09.645 --> 01:19:11.050
What are you doing?

01:19:11.085 --> 01:19:14.405
Sucking out the pimentos.
They give me hernias.

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.325
You mean hives, fish head.

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.690
Hit me, sergeant!

01:19:19.725 --> 01:19:23.565
Okay, but you can only have one.
And you have to sip it.

01:19:26.365 --> 01:19:30.205
Fever

01:19:31.565 --> 01:19:35.405
You're giving me fever

01:19:37.965 --> 01:19:40.810
Tell me about when I was born.

01:19:40.845 --> 01:19:44.645
Aren't you sick of hearing this story?

01:19:46.885 --> 01:19:48.970
You were born

01:19:49.005 --> 01:19:52.805
in a hospital in Minneapolis
on a cold winter's day.

01:19:53.005 --> 01:19:56.805
When Mrs. Flax brought you home
I pretended you were mine.

01:19:57.805 --> 01:20:01.225
Where was Pop?

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:04.645
I don't know.

01:20:11.245 --> 01:20:15.085
Come on, I'll show you the convent.

01:20:24.845 --> 01:20:26.770
Finish the story.

01:20:26.805 --> 01:20:30.645
I'll show you the tower.
You've never seen it.

01:21:01.965 --> 01:21:03.645
There it is!

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:05.290
Isn't it neat?

01:21:05.325 --> 01:21:08.010
I want to go up. I'm going.

01:21:08.045 --> 01:21:11.885
Not me. I'll fall off.
No you won't.

01:21:12.325 --> 01:21:14.525
How can you go in those shoes?

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.730
I'll manage.

01:21:16.765 --> 01:21:18.570
I'll go get rocks.

01:21:18.605 --> 01:21:22.405
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

01:23:13.325 --> 01:23:16.545
Oh, God. This is real.

01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:19.765
This is really real.

01:24:06.765 --> 01:24:10.565
Get her inside.

01:24:18.325 --> 01:24:22.165
Joseph, get an ambulance.

01:24:22.765 --> 01:24:26.565
Katie, please don't die. Please.

01:25:00.365 --> 01:25:04.165
Take Charlotte home.
We'll call when there's news. Tell Lou.

01:27:19.565 --> 01:27:23.405
Katydid.

01:27:24.565 --> 01:27:28.405
You were born in a hospital
in Minneapolis on a cold winter day.

01:27:30.805 --> 01:27:34.645
I brought you home
and Charlotte pretended you were hers.

01:27:36.685 --> 01:27:40.525
She even tried to make you call her Mom.

01:27:42.765 --> 01:27:46.565
We tickled your ears
and we watched you sleep.

01:27:51.125 --> 01:27:53.730
And the only thing...

01:27:53.765 --> 01:27:57.605
The only thing we ever agreed on
was that you were... a wonderful child.

01:28:49.805 --> 01:28:51.690
She'll be all right.

01:28:51.725 --> 01:28:55.565
They're keeping her in one more night
for observation.

01:28:57.645 --> 01:29:01.485
Your mother's on her way home.

01:29:17.165 --> 01:29:21.005
She's okay.

01:29:23.085 --> 01:29:26.885
She's okay.

01:29:43.325 --> 01:29:47.165
You look different.

01:29:47.245 --> 01:29:51.085
You look beautiful.

01:29:58.205 --> 01:30:00.865
Take care.

01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:03.525
You too.

01:31:06.725 --> 01:31:10.565
Be smart and stay away from me.

01:31:24.045 --> 01:31:27.845
I mean it.

01:31:35.965 --> 01:31:38.530
Want to take the book for her?

01:31:38.565 --> 01:31:41.530
What were you doing?
She could've died!

01:31:41.565 --> 01:31:44.605
You were supposed to watch her.
She could've died!

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:46.045
What the hell were you doing up there?

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.090
I know what you were doing.

01:31:47.125 --> 01:31:50.965
The whole goddamn town knows
what you were doing!

01:31:53.005 --> 01:31:56.845
I'm warning you! I'm crazy angry!

01:32:01.405 --> 01:32:04.685
Don't walk away!
Don't walk away from me!

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.605
I am not invisible!

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:10.405
Talk to me!

01:32:10.525 --> 01:32:12.170
Yes, I made a mistake!

01:32:12.205 --> 01:32:15.965
Yes, I am really sorry!
It was a big mistake!

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.970
I know that!

01:32:18.005 --> 01:32:21.205
You're always screwing up
and we always pay for it!

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:24.325
Every time you get dumped
or dump on somebody.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.502
It's not fair!

01:32:27.537 --> 01:32:30.645
It is not fair!

01:32:43.605 --> 01:32:46.925
I'm tired of being judged by you!
- You're a kid!

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.082
When you're an adult, live how you want.

01:32:50.117 --> 01:32:53.205
Until then,
we will live my life, my way!

01:32:56.245 --> 01:33:00.085
Pack!

01:33:00.525 --> 01:33:01.410
This move is on you!

01:33:01.445 --> 01:33:03.845
If loverboy doesn't like it, too bad!

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.245
This is not about him, it's about me.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.010
That's over! He's left!

01:33:08.045 --> 01:33:10.890
Surprise!
It's not like that!

01:33:10.925 --> 01:33:13.645
Maybe your life works for you
but it doesn't work for me!

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:14.730
I'm staying.

01:33:14.765 --> 01:33:16.805
And do what?
Finish high school.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.762
What's your major?
Town tramp?

01:33:19.797 --> 01:33:22.685
No, Mom. The town already has one.

01:33:55.125 --> 01:33:58.965
You're just one year younger
than I was when I had you.

01:34:01.005 --> 01:34:02.290
If you hate my life so much,

01:34:02.325 --> 01:34:06.165
why are you trying so hard
to make the same mistakes?

01:34:13.965 --> 01:34:17.805
How do you feel about this guy?

01:34:18.285 --> 01:34:20.485
I thought I loved him.

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:23.810
Sounds familiar.

01:34:23.845 --> 01:34:27.685
I thought you would take him away.

01:34:39.365 --> 01:34:41.165
Did you love my father?

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:44.965
Yeah, I did.

01:34:48.685 --> 01:34:52.525
What was he like?

01:34:53.645 --> 01:34:56.490
He was charming and...

01:34:56.525 --> 01:35:00.325
he made me feel really special
for about a minute and a half.

01:35:01.005 --> 01:35:04.805
Then he was gone.

01:35:05.925 --> 01:35:09.765
What did he look like?
Like you, only taller.

01:35:10.925 --> 01:35:12.810
I don't have any pictures.

01:35:12.845 --> 01:35:16.685
We took pictures at the wedding
and they didn't come out.

01:35:16.925 --> 01:35:19.445
I guess I should have known then.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:21.965
He's never coming back, is he?

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.765
No.

01:35:27.005 --> 01:35:28.850
Has he ever seen me?

01:35:28.885 --> 01:35:32.725
He did once. You were about 4.

01:35:33.845 --> 01:35:35.130
He wanted us back?

01:35:35.165 --> 01:35:39.005
No. He met another woman
and he wanted to get married.

01:35:44.205 --> 01:35:48.045
How do you feel about Joe leaving?

01:35:52.045 --> 01:35:55.845
It's fine.

01:35:57.085 --> 01:36:00.925
I guess it's too later for our birds
and bees talk, isn't it?

01:36:05.365 --> 01:36:09.205
Mom, can we please stay?

01:36:14.245 --> 01:36:16.365
I don't know.
There's going to be so much talk.

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.730
It's a small town.

01:36:18.765 --> 01:36:22.565
There's always talk.
It's just usually about you.

01:36:24.005 --> 01:36:27.845
I'm sorry.

01:36:32.445 --> 01:36:36.285
Just for a year. Give it a year.

01:36:42.125 --> 01:36:45.965
I don't know.

01:36:53.165 --> 01:36:56.965
Mrs. Flax promised
she'd try and stay put.

01:36:57.245 --> 01:37:01.085
I knew that would be hard for her.

01:37:12.405 --> 01:37:16.245
But 3 months later
she and Lou were still sparring.

01:37:17.805 --> 01:37:21.465
He took us to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
His heaven.

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:25.125
Mom was bored
but we thought she hid it quite well.

01:37:29.005 --> 01:37:32.845
This is Lou Gehrig's glove.
You see that?

01:37:32.885 --> 01:37:35.365
Okay, you touched it. All right, guys.

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:39.205
What's for lunch?

01:37:47.245 --> 01:37:49.805
If they squeeze your toes,
chew it awhile.

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.410
Is softens them.

01:37:51.445 --> 01:37:54.605
You don't believe me.
Eskimos do it all the time.

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:57.765
The wives do it.
Would you do it for your old man?

01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:01.605
I don't think so. 'Bye.

01:38:03.405 --> 01:38:05.210
Give me a break!

01:38:05.245 --> 01:38:07.925
I'm a nice old man.
I'd watch it, Lou.

01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:11.182
I might decide to move to a real city.

01:38:11.217 --> 01:38:14.405
I hate all these trees and weather.

01:38:15.205 --> 01:38:19.045
She won't admit it,
but they get along real well.

01:38:21.485 --> 01:38:25.285
Trees and weather can get to a person.

01:38:42.125 --> 01:38:44.825
I got quite a reputation for awhile.

01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:47.490
Even Mary O'Brien was impressed.

01:38:47.525 --> 01:38:51.365
It's not easy, but I'm trying
to keep romance on the back burner.

01:39:00.205 --> 01:39:02.890
Joe moved to California
and opened a nursery.

01:39:02.925 --> 01:39:06.725
We write. He sends me funny postcards
with pictures of palm trees on them.

01:39:20.045 --> 01:39:23.885
Greek myths are my new passion.

01:39:31.725 --> 01:39:35.565
Charlotte, we're not Greek.

01:39:36.925 --> 01:39:39.610
Kate's back in Olympic form.

01:39:39.645 --> 01:39:43.485
But since the accident,
sometimes her hearing gets fuzzy.

01:39:45.005 --> 01:39:48.845
I heard Mom say
she'd be making a main course tonight.

01:39:49.305 --> 01:39:55.537
