17:01.895 --> 17:03.939
Why don't you ask me, hmm?

17:05.524 --> 17:06.650
It's okay, just ask me!

17:08.902 --> 17:09.903
Go on.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.992
What is it you desire?

17:24.960 --> 17:27.546
[inhales] To see my daughter grow up.

17:30.924 --> 17:33.510
[Lucifer] To be there for her
when she needs me the most.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.179
[Rory grunts softly]

17:35.262 --> 17:37.264
To be the father she deserves.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.685
[Rory sniffles, whimpers]

17:46.482 --> 17:48.317
So, now you know.

17:49.943 --> 17:52.988
If you kill me and me alone,
you won't add to your torture

17:53.072 --> 17:55.949
'cause, well, I'm far from innocent.
Let's be honest, Vincent.

17:58.202 --> 18:01.038
And you'll get what you want.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.291
'Cause I will suffer…

18:05.667 --> 18:07.127
an unimaginable pain.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.341
The pain of leaving behind
the ones I love.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.346
My daughter.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.181
[Rory sighs, whimpers]

18:20.182 --> 18:21.100
Chloe.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.650
And my family.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.572
Yes.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.574
Is that it?

18:38.742 --> 18:40.494
That's what I was looking for.

18:40.577 --> 18:41.787
[Lucifer sniffles, huffs]

18:45.999 --> 18:48.043
Then let's finish this, shall we?

18:53.674 --> 18:56.969
[whimpers] No! No!

18:57.052 --> 18:58.345
[sobbing]

18:58.428 --> 18:59.513
No!

19:04.017 --> 19:05.811
[Rory continues sobbing]

19:12.109 --> 19:14.653
No! No!

19:16.655 --> 19:17.573
[chains clinking]

19:24.121 --> 19:25.956
-[screams]
-Dad!

19:33.088 --> 19:34.548
[gagging]

19:34.631 --> 19:38.302
No! Rory, no!
Rory, no, you can't do this! No!

19:38.385 --> 19:39.595
Rory!

19:39.678 --> 19:40.888
Don't do this, Rory!

19:40.971 --> 19:43.724
-[Vincent gagging]
-He deserves this.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.976
Rory… [gasps]

19:46.059 --> 19:49.021
Rory, killing him
won't change what he's done,

19:49.104 --> 19:50.689
but it will change you.

19:50.772 --> 19:51.648
[Vincent grunts]

19:51.732 --> 19:54.026
[Lucifer] Once you've done this,
there's no going back!

19:54.109 --> 19:56.445
-[panting] Rory.
-[gagging]

19:56.528 --> 19:59.823
I know what it's like
to be consumed by guilt,

19:59.907 --> 20:02.201
by anger and self-hatred. Trust me.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.536
-You do not wanna go down that road.
-[Vincent gags]

20:04.620 --> 20:08.123
You don't wanna live like that.
Do not give in to this monster!

20:08.207 --> 20:10.125
You have to be better than him!

20:10.959 --> 20:14.004
[whispers] Rory, please,
you have to be better than me.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.672
Please be better than me.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.217
Rory…

20:18.967 --> 20:19.801
Rory!

20:20.761 --> 20:21.803
[gasps] Please.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.814
[panting]

20:42.366 --> 20:43.659
You called me "Dad."

20:44.952 --> 20:46.495
-Did I?
-[Lucifer exhales]

20:47.704 --> 20:50.707
I thought I said something like, "Damn!"

20:51.250 --> 20:52.751
"That hurts."

20:52.834 --> 20:57.547
When I ripped my wings to,
you know, save your life.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.926
[gasps] Are you okay?

21:02.386 --> 21:03.262
Yeah.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.889
[Lucifer gasps, sighs]

21:09.559 --> 21:10.602
Mm.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.313
[screams]

21:13.397 --> 21:15.107
-[gunshot]
-[shouts, gags]

21:26.285 --> 21:27.911
[Rory gasps] Mom!

21:32.874 --> 21:34.876
[Vincent gasping]

21:42.301 --> 21:44.636
[groaning]

21:46.805 --> 21:48.890
I want to see…

21:49.933 --> 21:51.226
what he saw…

21:52.102 --> 21:53.770
when he left my body.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.065
I want to see the light.

21:59.693 --> 22:00.777
Do you mean Daniel?

22:02.612 --> 22:03.613
He saw the light?

22:05.574 --> 22:06.908
He made it to Heaven?

22:07.743 --> 22:10.203
-[exhales]
-[Vincent whimpers]

22:11.788 --> 22:14.833
He made it. [chuckles]

22:18.795 --> 22:19.880
I see…

22:25.093 --> 22:27.054
I see dark… darkness…

22:27.763 --> 22:30.057
[gags] Only darkness.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.448
[Lucifer] Okay, thank you.

22:48.283 --> 22:49.242
Thank you.

22:50.827 --> 22:52.913
[Lucifer] You said you were fine.

22:52.996 --> 22:53.997
And I am.

22:54.081 --> 22:57.626
Hmm. Now. The medic just said
you were this close to Heaven.

22:58.126 --> 23:01.546
I don't have another lifesaving ring,
so be more careful next time, please.

23:02.672 --> 23:05.384
Lucifer, it's August 5th.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.762
-There's no question. We did it.
-[exhales]

23:08.845 --> 23:10.931
I don't know how, but we did it.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.977
We did, didn't we? [chuckles]

23:19.439 --> 23:20.273
[exhales]

23:20.857 --> 23:22.234
Would you give me a moment?

23:22.317 --> 23:24.945
And, um, don't go anywhere.

23:25.862 --> 23:26.863
Funny.

23:28.824 --> 23:29.741
[chuckles]

23:30.534 --> 23:31.410
Ow.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.499
Why so glum?

23:37.582 --> 23:39.835
I mean, I am still here, after all.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.003
Yeah, but so am I.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.964
[hesitates] Yes.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.132
We all are.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.592
One big happy,
half-celestial, half-human family.

23:48.176 --> 23:49.344
Crisis averted, right?

23:49.428 --> 23:52.139
But if I'm still here in the past,

23:52.722 --> 23:55.892
that means that my future
still happens exactly how I lived it.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.396
Which-- which means you still abandon me.

23:59.479 --> 24:03.942
And I still get so angry that
I travel back in time to confront you.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.823
The fact is that you will leave.

24:13.034 --> 24:14.744
And I still don't know why.

24:32.345 --> 24:33.638
[Chloe] Dan's in Heaven?

24:33.722 --> 24:35.557
[both chuckle]

24:35.640 --> 24:38.768
-He did it. He actually did it.
-[laughs]

24:38.852 --> 24:40.395
-[chuckles]
-But how?

24:40.979 --> 24:43.398
That's what I'm still trying
to figure out.

24:46.943 --> 24:51.198
It was Dan that went to see Trixie,
when he was still in Le Mec's body.

24:51.281 --> 24:54.743
Uh, camp called and said
Trixie was talking to some stranger.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.620
That he said he was friends with her dad.

24:56.703 --> 24:59.206
Well, she must have said
something important to him.

24:59.289 --> 25:02.834
He'd been avoiding her this whole time.
What-- what made Dan go and see her?

25:02.918 --> 25:04.753
Oh, I did. [exhales]

25:05.504 --> 25:07.005
Huh? What?

25:08.632 --> 25:09.883
What did you say to him?

25:09.966 --> 25:14.095
I just told him it's not important
what you do with your time.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.223
It's more important who you spend it with.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.476
Then you got him to Heaven.

25:21.811 --> 25:22.687
[Lucifer] Hmm?

25:24.105 --> 25:25.649
[Chloe] Like you did with Lee.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.568
[hesitates] Oh!

25:28.652 --> 25:29.778
Mr. Said Out Bitch.

25:29.861 --> 25:30.779
Yeah.

25:30.862 --> 25:32.197
You broke his hell loop too.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.116
[Lucifer] Well, to be fair,
Lee broke his own hell loop.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.202
I just showed him a path.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.996
Or rather, a door,
to be precise. [chuckles]

25:40.080 --> 25:41.831
Like a wise therapist once said to me,

25:41.915 --> 25:45.085
I can't give you the right answers,
only the right questions.

25:46.878 --> 25:50.215
But still, Lucifer, you helped them.
You helped them both.

25:51.633 --> 25:52.592
[Rory] And me.

25:54.844 --> 25:56.346
I almost killed Le Mec.

25:57.847 --> 25:59.015
I wanted to.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.686
It was… so close.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.315
But when I looked in your eyes,
I knew you understood

26:08.316 --> 26:11.027
my anger and the guilt

26:12.279 --> 26:13.947
more than anyone else could.

26:14.030 --> 26:16.992
That's because
I didn't want you to repeat my sins.

26:19.494 --> 26:23.373
To succumb
to that monster that's inside of you.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.670
Feel the pain… that I felt.

26:29.838 --> 26:33.758
Maybe that's the real reason
I came back in time.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.135
So you could help me.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.972
[Chloe] So that you can help everyone.

26:39.055 --> 26:42.475
Every Dan down in Hell
who deserves another chance.

26:44.811 --> 26:45.645
Well…

26:50.191 --> 26:53.069
Well, I suppose
I do know what it's like to fall.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.156
And also to rise.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.452
Oh, you cheeky bastard.

27:01.870 --> 27:02.871
Who?

27:04.164 --> 27:04.998
My dad.

27:05.707 --> 27:06.916
[sighs]

27:07.000 --> 27:09.586
He said I'd figure it out, and I did.

27:10.545 --> 27:13.089
When he said Hell
no longer needs a keeper,

27:13.673 --> 27:14.633
it doesn't.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.010
It needs a healer.

27:17.844 --> 27:18.678
Chloe…

27:20.513 --> 27:23.600
I think I finally found my calling.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.101
[sighs]

27:25.769 --> 27:26.770
[gasps]

27:26.853 --> 27:27.687
[sighs]

27:29.898 --> 27:32.233
This… this is why you leave.

27:33.526 --> 27:36.446
What? No, I can just pop down to Hell,

27:36.529 --> 27:38.782
save a few souls
and then pop back up here again.

27:38.865 --> 27:40.659
It doesn't have to be a full-time job.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.286
I can still be in your life,
in both your lives.

27:43.370 --> 27:44.871
[scoffing] No, you can't.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.208
And that's why
you can't ever tell me why he left.

27:48.291 --> 27:50.293
I get why you had to keep it from me now.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.713
See? It all leads to this.

27:54.881 --> 27:59.052
Me, thinking you bailed
on August 4th with no explanation.

27:59.678 --> 28:03.098
Me, feeling abandoned and angry.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.975
So angry that I traveled back in time.

28:06.976 --> 28:09.437
Everything that we've been through,

28:09.521 --> 28:12.023
it all leads to what Dad just realized,

28:12.691 --> 28:15.610
that he needs to help those lost souls.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.237
[Lucifer exhales]

28:17.946 --> 28:21.157
We can't change anything,
or he might never get that idea.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.993
-But, Rory…
-[Rory] No buts, because, Dad…

28:25.829 --> 28:27.747
I was one of those lost souls.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.457
But that was my fault.

28:29.999 --> 28:30.917
No.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.461
No, it's my life. My choices.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.338
Don't you see, I--

28:36.131 --> 28:39.843
I'm the one who asked you…
to do what you did.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.011
And honestly…

28:43.513 --> 28:45.724
knowing what I know now, I--

28:45.807 --> 28:47.142
I wouldn't change a thing.

28:47.726 --> 28:48.768
-But…
-[Rory gasps]

you could be there for me

28:57.569 --> 29:00.071
