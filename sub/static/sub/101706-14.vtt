00:01.523 --> 00:03.525
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...What's this business idea?

00:03.568 --> 00:05.788
Auto repair shop. Nichelle's
not giving us the money no more,

00:05.831 --> 00:06.876
and no bank in the world's

00:06.919 --> 00:08.008
-gonna give us a loan.
-But I will.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.097
-What?
-I mean, what exactly

00:10.140 --> 00:11.750
are we talking about here?

00:11.794 --> 00:13.622
You giving us a loan?

00:13.665 --> 00:15.972
I was thinking I'd be more
of a partner in the business.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.235
Durham,
why are you here so late?

00:18.279 --> 00:20.324
I was hoping our kid'd be
asleep by the time I got there.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.022
Annie's kind of an expert
on toddlers.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.240
Why don't you
and the family

00:23.284 --> 00:24.328
come over for dinner
Friday night?

00:24.372 --> 00:25.503
She's here

00:25.547 --> 00:26.678
as a tactical emergency
medical support.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.506
A TEMS officer?

00:28.550 --> 00:30.465
Nora Fowler, right?
Why'd you sign up for this?

00:30.508 --> 00:31.596
I've seen combat
as an Army medic.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.989
I was an EMT for LAFD,

00:33.033 --> 00:34.077
finished first in my class

00:34.121 --> 00:35.557
in mountain rescue,
in deep water...

00:35.600 --> 00:37.167
So this is another notch
-on your résumé, then?
-No.

00:37.211 --> 00:39.865
-<i>I'm looking to save lives.
-Stay back until we've cleared.</i>

00:39.909 --> 00:41.780
I'm trained to go
into hostile situations.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.478
-What are you doing?
-I know you run the
show around here,

00:43.521 --> 00:45.393
but need to trust me,
or she won't survive.

00:45.436 --> 00:46.481
<i>The white nationalists
who killed Erika,</i>

00:46.524 --> 00:47.699
<i>the Imperial Dukes.</i>

00:47.743 --> 00:48.613
Now, we've already
taken down four of them,

00:48.657 --> 00:49.397
but I can't shake the feeling

00:49.440 --> 00:50.572
that there's more out there.

00:50.615 --> 00:51.747
I did some thinking
after you left.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.183
Vodka wears off,

00:53.227 --> 00:55.316
and Erika's still dead,
and I feel worse.

00:55.359 --> 00:57.187
There's a community
center near here

00:57.231 --> 00:59.494
that has a grief
group this evening.

00:59.537 --> 01:02.062
-Could you maybe come with me?
-Your wheels or mine?

01:09.112 --> 01:11.854
Out of my way!

01:14.639 --> 01:16.380
We're LAPD.
Get out of the area. Move.

01:16.424 --> 01:18.165
Out that way. Out that way.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.427
Hondo, we've got

01:19.470 --> 01:21.385
two armed robbery suspects
in custody.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.995
It's up to you guys
to bring in the runner.

01:24.301 --> 01:25.868
Use your eyes, Chris.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.609
Getting in position.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.703
I see movement. Guy's passing

01:34.746 --> 01:36.270
the red tent.

01:37.793 --> 01:40.100
It's too cluttered.
I don't have a shot.

01:49.326 --> 01:50.545
What do we got, Chris?

01:50.588 --> 01:51.894
He posted up.

01:51.937 --> 01:53.548
Blue and white RV,
second from the end.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.985
Street, go left. Go left.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.166
This is Sergeant Harrelson,

02:03.210 --> 02:04.907
LAPD! What's your name?

02:07.257 --> 02:09.433
Let me through!
I can do this all day!

02:09.477 --> 02:11.566
-And we still got people around.
This guy's reckless.

02:11.609 --> 02:12.871
If we push him, he's gonna keep

02:12.915 --> 02:15.047
-spraying bullets.
-Hondo, I have something.

02:15.091 --> 02:17.615
-Not much. Just his weapon.
-Take it, Chris.

02:24.796 --> 02:26.276
Down on the ground.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.756
-On the ground. Turn around.
Don't move!

02:27.799 --> 02:29.453
Keep your hands up.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.455
Final suspect in custody.

02:32.456 --> 02:34.632
Not bad, Chris.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.591
Maybe next time,
try using your sights?

02:36.634 --> 02:38.984
Nice job to you, too.

02:39.028 --> 02:41.204
Hey. Heard you guys
brought in those fugitives.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.423
Wanted to make sure you had

02:42.466 --> 02:43.989
an easy shift, Durham.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.643
Hey, it was nice to see
you and your wife last weekend.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.689
Annie and I appreciated
the grown-up company.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.908
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Actually,

02:49.952 --> 02:51.910
that's a "thank you."
The wine's for Annie,

02:51.954 --> 02:52.955
and the book's for you.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.478
Goes over
the policing tactics

02:54.522 --> 02:55.697
we were talking about.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.090
Helped me learn to walk
with dignity.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.440
Thank you.

02:59.483 --> 03:01.224
Yeah, I'm always looking
for a good read.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.834
-Yeah.
-All right.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.795
Okay, okay.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.231
This place is cleaning up nice.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.450
Starting to look
more like an auto shop

03:09.493 --> 03:10.799
and less like a trash pile.

03:10.842 --> 03:13.280
Some of us are willing to put in
the elbow grease.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.282
We found some cabinets
the last owners left.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.980
-Free tool storage.
-Nice.

03:18.023 --> 03:20.287
Well, I'm here to be of use.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.245
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

03:25.379 --> 03:27.294
I don't recall
seeing any of that

03:27.337 --> 03:28.686
before we signed the lease.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.645
Not hard to miss
a cracked window when the place

03:30.688 --> 03:31.646
is full of junk.

03:31.689 --> 03:32.821
Paint's fresh, Leroy.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.126
It's nothing, man.

03:35.345 --> 03:36.912
I-It was 'cause of me.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.392
Look, I was here yesterday,

03:38.435 --> 03:40.002
-and these two guys came by.
They, uh,

03:40.045 --> 03:41.395
told him the block

03:41.438 --> 03:44.267
was dangerous and the shop
needed their protection.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.486
An extortion racket.

03:45.529 --> 03:46.748
They want to be paid

03:46.791 --> 03:48.663
to not cause trouble.

03:48.706 --> 03:51.143
Nah, nah, nah, nah. I'm gonna
talk to the property manager,

03:51.187 --> 03:52.449
see if we can back out
of this place.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.321
-No way.
What, you want to split

03:54.364 --> 03:56.453
-at the first hard thing?
We picked this spot

03:56.497 --> 03:58.281
because this neighborhood
has a good rep

03:58.325 --> 04:00.501
and it wouldn't associate
ex-con mechanics

04:00.544 --> 04:02.503
with current gang activity.
Now, if that's changed...

04:02.546 --> 04:04.635
No, it's not a gang.

04:04.679 --> 04:07.856
I'm James.
I own the market next door.

04:07.899 --> 04:10.337
Wanted to come by
and say welcome.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.903
How you doing? I'm Hondo.

04:11.947 --> 04:14.341
That's Leroy and Darryl.

04:14.384 --> 04:17.344
Listen, uh,
this isn't a rough area.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.128
Just some guys
making mischief.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.912
Leader's named Alex.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.610
They showed up
a couple months ago.

04:22.653 --> 04:23.741
You know,
throw 'em a few bucks,

04:23.785 --> 04:25.265
they leave you alone.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.136
That's not an option for us.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.051
He's a cop.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.705
SWAT, actually.

04:30.748 --> 04:33.011
Whoa. Well...

04:33.055 --> 04:35.013
They're getting a fee

04:35.057 --> 04:36.493
from everyone around here,

04:36.537 --> 04:39.583
so if there is
anything you can do...

04:47.765 --> 04:49.854
Consider it done.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.257
Yo, Fowler.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.041
-Hey.
-Hey, Luca.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.216
You get here early?

05:04.260 --> 05:05.348
Yeah. Figured I'd make sure

05:05.392 --> 05:06.610
that Tan's treating
my girl right.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.264
I didn't know
you lived close by.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.787
Sort of. About six miles.

05:09.831 --> 05:11.006
Wow.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.355
Pre-shift workout, nice.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.661
It wakes me up.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.445
Plus, it gives me a chance
to enjoy my favorite

05:15.489 --> 05:17.360
terrible music judgment-free.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.362
Yeah, I hear that.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.972
All right.
I'll see you in there.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.278
Yeah.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.376
Better get comfy
in here, Luca,

05:33.420 --> 05:36.074
'cause 50-Squad is not handling
the full armory inventory again.

05:36.118 --> 05:39.382
Hey, Hicks's rules. Loser of
the Spring Relay has to do it.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.645
How many years in a row losing
has it been for you guys?

05:41.689 --> 05:43.168
Two? Three?

05:43.212 --> 05:45.562
Look, 20-Squad only edged us out
by a hair last year.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.216
you're on the downswing,

05:47.259 --> 05:50.654
and I don't see a winning
three-man combo in your ranks.

05:50.698 --> 05:53.048
Oh, I got some ideas
about our lineup.

05:53.091 --> 05:55.398
Like what?
Strapping on jet packs?

05:55.442 --> 05:57.139
Guess you'll have
to wait and see.

06:01.317 --> 06:03.014
Tabitha Lewis turned up
in the ER this morning

06:03.058 --> 06:04.276
with a broken arm.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.365
Who's Tabitha Lewis?

06:05.408 --> 06:06.931
Wife of Jared Lewis.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.846
Habitual domestic abuser,
white nationalist

06:08.890 --> 06:10.282
and most certainly a member

06:10.326 --> 06:11.632
of the Imperial Duke cell
that we brought down.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.460
Group that killed Erika Rogers.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.331
FBI suspects

06:15.375 --> 06:16.767
he was in
the recruiting process then.

06:16.811 --> 06:17.986
He wasn't a full soldier.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.335
But LAPD's on alert

06:19.379 --> 06:21.337
for anything involving
the Imperial Dukes.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.774
So the 911 call from Lewis's
home address got flagged.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.733
Lewis was gone when the
ambulance arrived,

06:25.776 --> 06:28.126
but Tabitha's not claiming
it was an accident this time.

06:28.170 --> 06:29.606
Well, it sounds like maybe she's
done protecting her husband.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.434
I volunteered SWAT
to go in and question her.

06:31.478 --> 06:34.176
Agent Carr knows
this is personal for us.

06:34.219 --> 06:36.483
FBI is working a paper trail
to find Lewis.

06:36.526 --> 06:39.355
This is an opportunity
for SWAT to be proactive.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.313
To avenge the death
of one of our own.

06:41.357 --> 06:44.142
Well, if Tabitha confirms Lewis
was being recruited,

06:44.186 --> 06:45.622
tells us where
he's hiding,

06:45.666 --> 06:46.841
we can grab him up for more
than just domestic violence.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.451
But we only got
one shot at it.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.844
If we spook her,
Tabitha's liable

06:49.887 --> 06:51.454
to clam up, or worse,
go running to Lewis

06:51.498 --> 06:52.586
and tell him that we've been
asking questions.

06:52.629 --> 06:55.023
These two been married
for ten years.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.851
Even if he's been harming her,
she likely holds

06:56.894 --> 06:58.287
the same racial
views as him.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.549
What if we lean
into her prejudices?

06:59.593 --> 07:01.333
You want to put on a show?

07:01.377 --> 07:02.422
We could use Luca.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.467
And you, if you're down?

07:04.511 --> 07:06.121
To use a racist's beliefs
against them?

07:06.164 --> 07:07.688
Yeah. All day, every day.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.258
Who are you?

07:13.302 --> 07:14.303
Get out of my room.

07:14.346 --> 07:15.913
I don't think so.
Victor Tan, LAPD.

07:15.957 --> 07:18.220
I need some answers.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.656
Excuse us, Mrs. Lewis.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.746
I was hoping to chat
with you about your husband?

07:22.790 --> 07:23.965
I already told the nurses
and the doctors

07:24.008 --> 07:25.140
all about what Jared did.

07:25.183 --> 07:26.968
Well, you still got
to talk to us, so...

07:28.012 --> 07:29.884
Please?

07:31.712 --> 07:34.062
Okay, how about I take
it from here, pal?

07:38.501 --> 07:40.547
Sorry about him.
He's a real pain in the ass.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.462
It's all right, Officer.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.812
I read your statement. You know
we'll bring your husband in

07:44.855 --> 07:46.770
-for domestic abuse.
-Good.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.337
I'm over his nonsense.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.818
I think, if you help me with
some other questions we have,

07:50.861 --> 07:53.647
we could keep you safe from
Lewis for a really long time.

07:56.214 --> 07:58.260
-I'll answer whatever I can.
-Have you ever heard

07:58.303 --> 08:00.523
Lewis mention
the Imperial Dukes?

08:00.567 --> 08:02.960
Sure, he talks
about all the "good things"

08:03.004 --> 08:04.353
they're doing for America.

08:04.396 --> 08:07.356
Recently? Is he still with them?

08:10.228 --> 08:12.013
Come on. You're done
with him, right?

08:13.667 --> 08:14.885
Lewis must have been
meeting them

08:14.929 --> 08:16.234
in a different part
of town, though,

08:16.278 --> 08:17.801
'cause he's been
staying out later.

08:17.845 --> 08:18.976
Did he say what the Dukes
are planning?

08:19.020 --> 08:21.239
Kept talking about
their "victory."

08:21.283 --> 08:24.155
Killing that Black cop
was just the beginning.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.593
He said they're gonna
show the whole city

08:26.636 --> 08:28.333
what they're capable of.

08:28.377 --> 08:29.813
<i>If Lewis is still active,</i>

08:29.857 --> 08:32.381
that means we're looking
at a second Imperial Duke cell.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.165
And they're planning an attack
they call the "Reckoning."

08:34.209 --> 08:35.863
The Reckoning?
What the hell does that mean?

08:35.906 --> 08:37.299
Tabitha didn't know,

08:37.342 --> 08:38.822
but she says it's supposed
to be worse than anything

08:38.866 --> 08:40.476
they've done before. And, Hondo?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.956
Whatever it is, she said

08:41.999 --> 08:43.740
it's going down today.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.563
FBI's research hasn't
turned up anything about

09:23.606 --> 09:26.043
an Imperial Duke attack
called the Reckoning.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.568
Patrol's on high alert
for Lewis and the Dukes.

09:28.611 --> 09:31.092
Luca's back with Tabitha, seeing
if he can get more out of her.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.354
L.A.'s a diverse city
with a lot

09:32.397 --> 09:34.138
of places and events
they could attack,

09:34.182 --> 09:35.836
try and kick off their race war.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.272
Last time they hit businesses
and cultural centers.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.490
Might share a goal,

09:38.534 --> 09:39.535
but we can't assume these

09:39.579 --> 09:40.754
are the same Dukes as before.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.669
Cells can operate
very differently.

09:42.712 --> 09:43.670
What do we know about this one?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.585
Tabitha gave us Lewis's

09:45.628 --> 09:47.108
last few public usernames.

09:47.151 --> 09:49.545
FBI plugged them
into our ongoing research.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.547
Showed who he interacts with
and how.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.723
"This video proves
a Black celebrity's company

09:53.767 --> 09:55.638
"is secretly
trafficking children.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.771
It's time to wake up."

09:57.814 --> 10:00.208
This is crazy
conspiracy theory stuff.

10:00.251 --> 10:02.776
Makes people click. They think
that they're helping kids,

10:02.819 --> 10:04.647
really, they're getting fed
disinformation.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.344
Now, all of these accounts

10:06.388 --> 10:08.346
-are Dukes?
-It's likely some are.

10:08.390 --> 10:11.175
Lewis's activity suggests this
cell is a propaganda machine.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.308
Well, he's good at it. Guessing
that's why this second cell

10:13.351 --> 10:16.050
risked recruiting him
after we shut down the first.

10:16.093 --> 10:17.704
So they're building
a legion of followers to help

10:17.747 --> 10:19.401
spread their ideas
across the Internet.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.316
They want attention.
This attack will likely give

10:21.359 --> 10:23.405
the Dukes some message
to push on social media.

10:23.448 --> 10:24.928
But these accounts
switch topics

10:24.972 --> 10:26.582
every other minute,
looking to trend.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.931
What's their real focus?

10:27.975 --> 10:30.412
FBI believes they discuss
real plans face-to-face

10:30.455 --> 10:32.414
or in an encrypted forum.
But we haven't

10:32.457 --> 10:34.895
been able to crack where they're
meeting in person or digitally.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.679
Too many blank spaces.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.681
We don't know the when,
where or how of this attack.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.552
Just that it's somehow
worse than Erika.

10:40.596 --> 10:41.858
Well, we know
Lewis is involved.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.425
So we find him,
we find the rest of 'em

10:43.468 --> 10:45.993
and answers
will follow.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.346
Deac. There you are, man.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.870
Listen, I got to skip
out of here for a second.

10:53.914 --> 10:56.394
What's going on
with you?

10:56.438 --> 10:58.658
Sorry... nothing.

10:58.701 --> 10:59.963
Well, maybe something.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.225
Annie and the kids?

11:01.269 --> 11:02.923
No, no. They're good.
Everything's fine.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.099
Um...

11:05.142 --> 11:07.405
I'm probably just
overthinking something.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.581
So lay it on me.
I'll overthink it with you.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.367
You know Lee Durham, the new kid

11:12.410 --> 11:14.238
-that just joined 60-Squad?
-Sure.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.849
He's taken a shine to you.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.720
Can't fault his taste.

11:17.764 --> 11:18.895
Yeah, right.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.767
He gave me this book,

11:20.810 --> 11:22.899
<i>Principled Policing
in a Modern Era.</i>

11:22.943 --> 11:24.596
-Never heard of it.
-No, me neither.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.642
But I wanted to be polite,
so I read a few chapters.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.688
It's self-published. It, uh...

11:28.731 --> 11:30.994
it promotes some pretty

11:31.038 --> 11:33.736
surveilling citizens
with no criminal ties,

11:33.780 --> 11:35.695
weaponizing programs like
-See Something/
-Say Something.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.740
Deacon, in my life,
I've had to learn to not

11:37.784 --> 11:39.742
cry wolf just because
something smelled a bit funky.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.222
I mean, the kid could've
just picked up

11:41.265 --> 11:42.745
the first book
with the word "police" on it.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.312
He ever given you
a weird vibe before?

11:44.355 --> 11:45.879
A little.

11:48.185 --> 11:49.926
When he gave me the book,

11:49.970 --> 11:52.668
he used the words,
"walk with dignity."

11:52.712 --> 11:54.888
At first I thought it
was just odd phrasing,

11:54.931 --> 11:56.672
but I remembered that...

11:56.716 --> 11:58.152
that list of white nationalist
code phrases.

11:58.195 --> 11:59.762
I went back and looked at it.

11:59.806 --> 12:02.547
Yeah, how'd it go? "I aim to
walk the path with dignity..."

12:02.591 --> 12:05.202
"...pure of body and spirit."

12:05.246 --> 12:06.900
It's not one
of the most common ones,

12:06.943 --> 12:08.423
and he didn't use
the exact same quote.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.338
I mean, Durham had
to have been vetted

12:10.381 --> 12:11.818
to be a SWAT recruit, right?

12:11.861 --> 12:13.341
He's been in LAPD
a long time.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.125
I'm sure he's clean
and buckled up.

12:16.431 --> 12:19.260
We can pull his file,
take a look for ourselves.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.484
Did your husband
ever talk about weapons?

12:26.528 --> 12:28.965
Like, maybe a new gun
he'd bought or something

12:29.009 --> 12:32.403
-a friend had?
-He always wanted one
of those James Bond guns.

12:43.937 --> 12:46.287
LAPD. Can I help you?

12:47.592 --> 12:49.986
Stop!

12:55.426 --> 12:57.124
I got some questions for you.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.783
-Hey, you got him?
-Yeah.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.134
So the Imperial Dukes
really are active again?

13:07.177 --> 13:09.049
-That's frightening.
-Yeah. Hopefully this guy

13:09.092 --> 13:11.007
spits out some answers,
keeps us ahead of 'em.

13:11.051 --> 13:14.619
Listen, I got to get into
Interrogation,

13:14.663 --> 13:16.926
have you heard
about Hicks's three-man

13:16.970 --> 13:18.449
relay race
happens every year?

13:18.493 --> 13:20.103
Winner gets showered with honor
and glory, loser has

13:20.147 --> 13:21.975
to spend a couple days taking
inventory of the armory?

13:22.018 --> 13:23.411
-Yeah, that's the one.
-Mm-hmm.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.543
I wanted to ask
if you'd consider

13:25.587 --> 13:27.676
joining 20-Squad's team.
We'd have

13:27.719 --> 13:29.591
Tan, Street and you.
That's a winning combo.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.071
I don't think I'm right for it.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.246
Are you kidding?
You're perfect!

13:32.289 --> 13:33.464
I looked you up.
You're a high school

13:33.508 --> 13:34.596
cross-country All-American?

13:34.639 --> 13:35.902
That was before I had a kid.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.686
You run six miles to work
multiple times a week.

13:37.729 --> 13:38.861
I know I'm a good runner, Luca.

13:38.905 --> 13:39.862
That's not the problem.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.429
So what is it?

13:41.472 --> 13:43.561
I don't just work with you guys.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.912
I mean, I ride with all
the squads here and...

13:45.955 --> 13:47.870
Picking favorites just sounds

13:47.914 --> 13:49.263
like making more
enemies than friends.

13:49.306 --> 13:50.742
Sorry.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.440
It's a no.
Okay, then.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.529
No sweat.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.321
Yo, Alex.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.410
Yo.

14:08.108 --> 14:10.023
You don't mind if my boy here
makes sure our rights

14:10.066 --> 14:11.894
-aren't infringed on, do you?
-As long as y'all don't

14:11.938 --> 14:13.983
mind me asking you
to stop squeezing businesses

14:14.027 --> 14:15.158
for protection money.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.987
The market, salon,
auto shop, everything.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.249
Don't hit 'em up again.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.077
Don't know what
you're talking about, sir.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.209
Y'all need cash?

14:22.252 --> 14:23.688
Then make the money
the right way.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.473
Come by the auto shop,

14:25.516 --> 14:27.475
and we'll hook you up
-with a gig.
-Working for you?

14:27.518 --> 14:28.606
A cop?

14:28.650 --> 14:29.912
No way.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.305
Real recognize real.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.828
Ain't nothing
about you real, man.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.482
So why don't you check
that attitude,

14:34.525 --> 14:36.092
and be a part of keeping
this neighborhood nice?

14:36.136 --> 14:37.702
Because I can
promise you this...

14:37.746 --> 14:39.704
I will be.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.970
You got nothing on us,

14:44.013 --> 14:45.667
or you would've brought out
the cuffs already.

14:45.710 --> 14:46.973
Yeah. So, uh...

14:47.016 --> 14:49.236
bounce, my brother.

14:52.456 --> 14:55.068
Be seeing you around then.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.854
Guy from the hospital
is Kyle Falley.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.204
He's not talking,
but Tabitha ID'd him as one

15:01.248 --> 15:03.119
-of Lewis's friends.
-He's probably an Imperial Duke

15:03.163 --> 15:05.034
tasked with keeping
eyes on Lewis's wife.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.993
I pulled his records--
unmarried,

15:07.036 --> 15:09.212
lives in the Valley,
teaches third grade.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.953
Teacher?

15:10.997 --> 15:13.216
He's also been posting
on Twitter

15:13.260 --> 15:15.044
about needing
to defend against illegals,

15:15.088 --> 15:16.785
"using force
if necessary."

15:16.828 --> 15:19.614
I can't imagine being a kid in
his class, soaking up that hate.

15:19.657 --> 15:20.920
And did you know

15:20.963 --> 15:22.573
Lewis works as a headhunter?

15:22.617 --> 15:24.575
What kind of applicant
is he fighting for?

15:24.619 --> 15:26.012
Or against?

15:27.230 --> 15:29.363
Anyway, Falley's,
uh, financials...

15:29.406 --> 15:31.234
Hey, Chris? You're putting up
a good front.

15:31.278 --> 15:33.193
But this is the Imperial Dukes.

15:33.236 --> 15:35.717
Lewis was involved
with the cell that killed Erika.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.719
It's-it's okay
if today's a tough day.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.286
I'm not worried
I'm gonna choke

15:39.329 --> 15:41.810
in the field or anything,
but, um...

15:43.333 --> 15:45.553
I just started to get my head
straight again, you know?

15:45.596 --> 15:48.251
-And suddenly the Dukes are back.
-I need to stay busy

15:48.295 --> 15:50.427
and, uh, try not
to dwell on Erika.

15:50.471 --> 15:51.776
That's what's gonna stop

15:51.820 --> 15:53.604
this Reckoning
and bring this new cell down.

15:53.648 --> 15:56.433
Makes sense.

15:56.477 --> 15:57.913
Look.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.307
Falley owns a shell
corporation.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.917
Leases a warehouse
in North Hollywood.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.919
Contract started six weeks ago.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.703
That's when Tabitha said
Lewis started staying

16:05.747 --> 16:07.879
out later.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.056
Lewis's cell phone pinged
towers near the warehouse,

16:10.099 --> 16:11.971
starting right after
Falley rented the space.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.276
If they met up there,

16:13.320 --> 16:14.625
other Imperial Dukes
probably did, too.

16:14.669 --> 16:15.931
Sounds like they've
been planning

16:15.975 --> 16:17.106
these attacks for a while.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.456
Could be their base
of operations.

16:20.544 --> 16:21.589
<i>Got the warrant.</i>

16:21.632 --> 16:23.025
Last loading dock is Falley's.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.505
7,800 square feet.

16:24.548 --> 16:25.680
Owner hasn't had
a reason to go in

16:25.723 --> 16:27.073
since the Dukes
started renting it.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.857
Means we've got no idea
what the setup looks like.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.163
Used to manufacture
aerospace parts there,

16:30.206 --> 16:31.642
so the walls are insulated.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.731
The thermal drone scan
gave us nothing real.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.037
All right, eyes on me.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.734
Yes, we're going blind
into the layout,

16:36.778 --> 16:38.214
and we don't know
how many Imperial Dukes

16:38.258 --> 16:39.911
might be in there or what
kind of weaponry they got.

16:39.955 --> 16:41.565
This isn't the most
unknowns we've faced.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.045
And even if it was,

16:43.089 --> 16:44.481
we know how to handle it.

17:05.546 --> 17:07.113
Street, go.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.202
Tan.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.080
Ready, Hondo.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.082
-25-David, set.
On my count.

17:20.126 --> 17:22.519
Three, two, one.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.273
Drop it!

17:39.101 --> 17:40.929
30-David. One suspect down.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.104
Clear.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.193
Got some weaponry-- semiautos.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.242
Someone else is here.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.070
We got movement.
Shots fired!

17:51.113 --> 17:52.897
One in the back. Move.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.943
Street, go right.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.393
All clear.

18:12.352 --> 18:15.616
Better to not leave here
in a body bag.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.142
Okay.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.665
Guns to the side-- push 'em out.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.493
Okay.
Drop the weapon,
on the ground.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.800
Get on the ground,
hands behind your head!

18:25.843 --> 18:28.237
Street.

18:31.936 --> 18:34.243
This is 20-David,
we're Code 4.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.897
Search the space.
We need details

18:35.940 --> 18:37.855
on what this Reckoning is.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.295
Stacks of ammo, but I haven't
seen planning materials

18:42.338 --> 18:44.166
or schematics that indicate
a how or where.

18:44.210 --> 18:47.082
White supremacist literature
and a lot of empty beer cans.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.302
Looks like an Imperial Duke
social club.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.086
Hondo, got something.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.221
All this junk piled up?

18:55.264 --> 18:56.613
Looks like someone was
trying to hide this.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.702
It's methyl isocyanate.

18:58.746 --> 19:00.748
Useful as a liquid but
deadly if it vaporizes.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.663
Inhale it,
it'll burn your lungs out.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.447
Kills within minutes.

19:04.491 --> 19:05.840
Toxic gas.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.537
Well, that answers one
question-- the what--

19:07.581 --> 19:09.191
-but it doesn't answer the where.
-Well, it gets worse.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.280
The tank is empty. Looks
like someone transferred it

19:11.324 --> 19:13.456
to another container and got
it off-site before we arrived.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.370
They still have their weapon.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.770
Our friends from the warehouse,

19:22.813 --> 19:25.120
Franklin Russo and Cormac Hill.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.774
Pulled security cam footage,

19:26.817 --> 19:28.515
found three more cell members.

19:28.558 --> 19:29.820
I.D.s still pending.

19:29.864 --> 19:31.300
My question is, how'd these guys

19:31.344 --> 19:33.737
get their hands
on methyl isocyanate?

19:33.781 --> 19:35.739
Tank of MIC was stolen
from a factory a month ago.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.915
We couldn't find any connection
to the Imperial Dukes.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.482
Facility manager
says they have

19:39.526 --> 19:41.092
inventory flux
all the time.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.529
Plant assumed it was
a computer error.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.574
they didn't investigate.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.010
Dukes pump this
stuff into the air,

19:46.054 --> 19:47.751
we're looking
at mass casualties.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.188
Plus, it's strong--
you don't need

19:49.231 --> 19:50.754
an enclosed space
to kill by exposure.

19:50.798 --> 19:53.235
So they could hit
a building, park, anything.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.237
Even though they're targeting
people of color,

19:55.281 --> 19:57.239
it's too wide a net.
I mean, it'd be hard

19:57.283 --> 19:59.372
to walk right up someplace
with a bunch of gas.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.243
They must have some
kind of delivery plan.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.550
It could help us zero
in on their target.
Find it.

20:03.593 --> 20:04.986
I'll see what Luca and Deacon

20:05.029 --> 20:07.075
are getting out of Hill
in interrogation.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.082
I'm fine. It's just...

20:14.125 --> 20:16.258
These guys keep slipping
through our fingers,

20:16.302 --> 20:18.608
and I'm sick of it.

20:18.652 --> 20:20.262
How about you help me

20:20.306 --> 20:22.177
do this research and
we use it to nail 'em?

20:25.485 --> 20:27.269
The MIC...

20:27.313 --> 20:29.619
who are the Imperial Dukes
planning to use it on?

20:29.663 --> 20:32.056
One day,
your eyes will be opened.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.754
The inferior races,

20:33.797 --> 20:35.234
the crisis actors

20:35.277 --> 20:37.758
and deep state politicians
will be rounded up.

20:37.801 --> 20:41.370
It is our duty to keep justice
alive until then.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.590
Look, justice doesn't
involve attacking people

20:43.633 --> 20:45.766
for having different beliefs
or a different skin color.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.550
Well, they come for us,

20:47.594 --> 20:49.291
for our whiteness,

20:49.335 --> 20:50.771
and you do nothing.

20:50.814 --> 20:52.251
How will they come for us?

20:52.294 --> 20:55.384
You say my eyes will be opened
eventually, why not now?

20:55.428 --> 20:57.778
They teach our children
to hate themselves.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.170
They're trying
to replace

20:59.214 --> 21:01.477
white culture.
They tear down our monuments.

21:01.521 --> 21:02.826
Tell us what monument.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.219
Maybe we can help protect it.

21:06.395 --> 21:09.398
The Imperial Dukes will be the
first soldiers in a great war.

21:10.791 --> 21:11.922
Great war?

21:12.967 --> 21:15.012
You can't stop
what's already here.

21:16.187 --> 21:18.668
I don't agree with
the destruction of statues,

21:18.712 --> 21:21.280
but Hill shouldn't need
one to remember history.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.456
He's not gonna give us anything
real about their plan.

21:23.499 --> 21:24.979
He doesn't have to.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.589
Was going through the stuff
we found at the warehouse.

21:26.633 --> 21:27.721
Hill, Falley
and Russo all have

21:27.764 --> 21:29.157
authenticator apps
on their phones.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.116
-This is Hill's.
-Constantly shifting password.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.553
Well, Agent Carr said the Dukes
have an encrypted forum.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.598
I'm thinking maybe
this unlocks it.

21:35.642 --> 21:36.773
Okay.

21:38.601 --> 21:40.255
Listen, Darryl, Alex and
his guys are just punks, man,

21:40.299 --> 21:41.735
but they ain't gonna
back down easy

21:41.778 --> 21:43.084
from messin' with the auto shop.

21:43.127 --> 21:44.128
So they're just gonna
ruin our business?

21:44.172 --> 21:45.129
Not true.

21:45.173 --> 21:46.740
I already talked to Patrol

21:46.783 --> 21:48.089
and they're gonna keep
extra eyes on the whole block.

21:48.132 --> 21:49.395
So your cop solution
didn't work,

21:49.438 --> 21:50.874
and now you're gonna
double down?

21:50.918 --> 21:52.615
I thought you were supposed
to be a silent partner.

21:52.659 --> 21:54.269
Also picked up
some security cameras,

21:54.313 --> 21:55.575
so if they come back,
we got something

21:55.618 --> 21:56.750
-to bring 'em in on.
-But how long's

21:56.793 --> 21:57.838
that gonna take?
Too long.

21:57.881 --> 21:59.274
Or until the
building burns down.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.276
-Whichever comes first.
-It's not gonna come to that.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.669
Doing things right takes time.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.279
We just need a little patience.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.673
I'll come by tonight
and install the cameras.

22:10.154 --> 22:11.460
Hey, what's up?

22:12.505 --> 22:14.942
So, I pulled everything the
department has on Lee Durham.

22:14.985 --> 22:17.248
I'm not seeing anything.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.381
Also made some calls; no one's
got a bad word to say about him.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.513
Well, if there
was something

22:20.556 --> 22:21.862
really damning
in his history,

22:21.905 --> 22:23.342
it would show up
in his SWAT interview.

22:24.778 --> 22:27.171
Well, wait a minute.

22:28.825 --> 22:29.957
Look at that.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.568
He worked Patrol
in Granada Hills.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.831
Black residents make up
five percent of that population,

22:34.875 --> 22:36.616
30 percent of Durham's arrests.

22:36.659 --> 22:37.965
Targeting?

22:38.008 --> 22:39.096
Cop who sees
Black people as criminals

22:39.140 --> 22:40.359
finds a reason
to book them more often.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.056
Could just be bad training.

22:42.099 --> 22:43.362
Geez,
I don't know.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.712
I mean, this is all
just so circumstantial.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.540
Except...

22:47.583 --> 22:49.585
that phrase he used.

22:50.673 --> 22:51.935
That was odd.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.372
Deacon, to bring a complaint
to Internal Affairs

22:53.415 --> 22:54.721
saying Durham is
a racist on the job...

22:54.764 --> 22:55.983
you better be damn sure.

22:56.026 --> 22:58.028
Are you?

22:59.856 --> 23:01.641
-No.
-When Durham said
those words to you,

23:01.684 --> 23:03.425
it might've been an attempt
to feel you out.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.993
You can use it
the same way.

23:06.036 --> 23:07.995
Reply with the other half--

23:08.038 --> 23:09.823
"pure of body and spirit"--

23:09.866 --> 23:11.738
see what he does.

23:13.870 --> 23:16.351
God, I hope this is
all just nothing.

23:18.222 --> 23:21.008
...and if you join our
relay team, we have a gift card

23:21.051 --> 23:23.358
to that Japanese place on Third
with your name on it.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.838
Thank you, but...

23:24.881 --> 23:27.275
Look, I don't know
what Luca offered you...

23:27.318 --> 23:29.277
Well, I didn't try
to bribe her.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.713
It's not a bribe.

23:30.757 --> 23:32.193
A bonus offer.

23:32.236 --> 23:33.586
And you're only mad
'cause I figured out

23:33.629 --> 23:35.501
your plan
to bring in a ringer.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.503
This is low, Rocker,
even for you.

23:37.546 --> 23:38.765
It's not my problem if 20-Squad

23:38.808 --> 23:40.244
isn't willing to do
what it takes to win.

23:40.288 --> 23:41.245
All right,
this is pointless,

23:41.289 --> 23:42.377
'cause I'm gonna be cheering

23:42.421 --> 23:43.726
-from the sidelines.
No way.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.032
The whole place knows
that you're the real deal.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.903
Every squad wants you.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.644
You can't let
the people down.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.690
You just have to pick
who you're partnering up with.

23:51.778 --> 23:54.084
Damned if I do,
damned if I don't.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.086
Might as well get something
out of it for me.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.827
So, here's

23:57.871 --> 24:00.743
gift cards, hook-ups, swag--

24:00.787 --> 24:02.310
best offer wins.

24:02.353 --> 24:03.920
Oh, I gotta go.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.574
Uh, tell everyone
to get their pitches in.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.228
I'll commit to a team
by the end of the day.

24:07.271 --> 24:09.143
Yep.

24:14.931 --> 24:17.238
So this is the Imperial Dukes'
private forum.

24:17.281 --> 24:18.761
You really gotta
know their lingo--

24:18.805 --> 24:20.546
most of this is
in-jokes and memes.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.069
It's the motherlode.

24:22.112 --> 24:23.897
FBI's downloading
everything we can,

24:23.940 --> 24:25.159
prioritizing the search

24:25.202 --> 24:26.421
for mentions of
the Reckoning attack,

24:26.465 --> 24:27.553
toxic gas...

24:27.596 --> 24:28.945
What is this?

24:28.989 --> 24:30.512
That's new. Looks
like a private message.

24:30.556 --> 24:33.036
"LAPD raided warehouse.
Is the other

24:33.080 --> 24:35.343
behind the veil?"We're logged in
as a member of the cell.

24:35.386 --> 24:36.475
He thinks we're Hill.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.737
This is a Bible reference.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.608
The Dukes twist
a lot of religious imagery.

24:39.652 --> 24:41.567
He's asking if Russo's dead.

24:41.610 --> 24:42.829
Isaiah 25:7.

24:42.872 --> 24:44.134
"The veil that is spread
over all nations."

24:44.178 --> 24:45.962
The reading at
my father's funeral.

24:46.006 --> 24:47.834
Yeah, but if Hill got out,
how would he know

24:47.877 --> 24:49.139
what happened to Russo?

24:50.401 --> 24:52.142
"I am not Lot's wife."

24:55.058 --> 24:56.843
"Do you have the van?"

24:56.886 --> 24:58.148
The van?

24:58.192 --> 24:59.236
-I don't know this code.
-It might not be code.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.977
There was a van
at the warehouse.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.762
It's sitting in the motor pool,
waiting to be swept for prints.

25:02.805 --> 25:04.285
What would they need it for?

25:04.328 --> 25:05.591
Part of the Reckoning plan?

25:05.634 --> 25:07.418
Or maybe just a way
to prove it's really Hill?

25:07.462 --> 25:09.856
Yeah, we'll look into the van.
Right now, we need to answer.

25:13.860 --> 25:16.079
"Meet at the Alameda Tavern

25:16.123 --> 25:17.516
parking lot at 4:00 p.m."

25:17.559 --> 25:19.169
Restaurant's white-owned
in a mostly white suburb,

25:19.213 --> 25:20.562
not a likely target.

25:20.606 --> 25:22.608
You already found their HQ--

25:22.651 --> 25:24.000
could it be a staging area

25:24.044 --> 25:25.611
-or a meet point?
-Or a trap.

25:25.654 --> 25:27.787
Lure SWAT in, instead
of killing one officer,

25:27.830 --> 25:29.440
take out a whole team.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.970
Website says
the restaurant's closed today.

25:37.013 --> 25:38.449
Infrared scan turned up nothing.

25:38.493 --> 25:39.755
Building's empty and secure.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.282
Couple civilians around,

25:45.326 --> 25:46.501
but no unusual loitering.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.894
It's past 4:00.

25:49.330 --> 25:50.636
Where are
these guys hiding?

25:50.679 --> 25:53.160
They want to see the van
before showing themselves.

25:53.203 --> 25:55.641
If it's a trap, they want
us all the way in it.

25:57.120 --> 26:00.210
-Street, you're a go.
-All right. Coming in.

26:18.359 --> 26:19.621
Van's in position.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.669
Two men approaching on foot.

26:23.712 --> 26:24.887
Got eyes on 'em.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.497
At least one's carrying.
Move in.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.151
-LAPD! Show your hands!
-Show your hands, now!

26:28.195 --> 26:29.631
Hands in the air.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.154
Fowler. Stay
by the car.

26:31.198 --> 26:32.852
Keep your hands up. Don't move.

26:33.766 --> 26:34.984
Tell us your target.

26:35.028 --> 26:37.117
Hey, we didn't do
anything illegal.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.553
I got a permit for that gun.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.641
We're not the rioters.

26:39.685 --> 26:40.642
Rioters?

26:40.686 --> 26:41.774
What's he talking about?

26:41.817 --> 26:43.253
We came to defend this place.

26:43.297 --> 26:44.733
Wait, hold up. You're here
to protect the restaurant?

26:44.777 --> 26:46.213
Yeah, isn't that
why you're here?

26:46.256 --> 26:48.084
-Protect it from what?
-The anti-fascists

26:48.128 --> 26:49.477
planning on burning it down.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.873
Look, this guy sounds twisted,
but not like an Imperial Duke.

26:53.916 --> 26:55.962
-Where'd you hear about this?
-It's all over social media.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.920
Pics of their Molotov cocktail
assembly line and everything.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.400
Okay, searching now.

27:00.662 --> 27:02.403
Another group of four incoming.

27:02.446 --> 27:04.013
They don't seem
like the Dukes either.

27:04.057 --> 27:05.711
They've got
protest signs.

27:05.754 --> 27:08.235
Street, go with Fowler--
intercept.

27:08.278 --> 27:09.932
We see the pictures
he's talking about,

27:09.976 --> 27:10.977
but a reverse
image search

27:11.020 --> 27:13.370
shows the actual original post.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.721
Look, these pictures are really
from four years ago in Indiana.

27:15.764 --> 27:18.071
They're photoshopped
to include today's date

27:18.114 --> 27:19.202
and this restaurant.

27:19.246 --> 27:20.290
The Dukes are using

27:20.334 --> 27:21.509
their Internet followers
against us.

27:21.552 --> 27:22.510
It wasn't a trap.

27:22.553 --> 27:23.598
This whole thing's
a distraction

27:23.642 --> 27:25.600
to keep us running
around the city.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.167
All right, get the hell
out of here.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.343
Everybody back to HQ
until we find the real target.

27:36.393 --> 27:37.438
Hey.

27:37.481 --> 27:38.700
All right, I'll see you then.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.094
Heard the Imperial Dukes
called off the meet,

27:41.137 --> 27:42.182
wiped the whole
secret forum clean.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.487
Fake images of
the restaurant

27:43.531 --> 27:45.838
were posted
before we even got in position.

27:45.881 --> 27:47.709
And now they're just
in the wind.

27:48.841 --> 27:50.712
Knowing the Dukes are out there
walking around free

27:50.756 --> 27:52.409
after killing Rogers...

27:52.453 --> 27:54.455
I hope SWAT can stop 'em
for good this time.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.632
Well, their kind of hate,
it's hard to swallow.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.242
Yeah. That's for sure.

27:59.286 --> 28:00.766
Hey, listen,
me and some buddies

28:00.809 --> 28:02.419
are grilling tonight
after all this is over.

28:02.463 --> 28:04.421
Maybe you stop by,
have a beer?

28:04.465 --> 28:06.119
If I'm free, I'm there.

28:06.162 --> 28:07.773
Yeah?

28:07.816 --> 28:09.165
All right.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.130
<i>Need some good news.</i>

28:17.173 --> 28:18.653
Been exploring
how the Dukes plan

28:18.697 --> 28:20.394
to get their toxic gas
to their target.

28:20.437 --> 28:22.962
We found a decal in the van
for Castanera Party Rentals.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.267
What if they're planning

28:24.311 --> 28:25.573
to pass themselves off
as event deliverymen?

28:25.616 --> 28:27.923
Hide toxic gas canisters
with chairs and tables.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.620
The company also has
heat lamps.

28:29.664 --> 28:31.448
The kind that run off
small propane tanks.

28:31.492 --> 28:33.015
Fill the tanks
with MIC instead...

28:33.059 --> 28:34.582
You could walk
right in anywhere.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.279
Temperature drops below 70,

28:36.323 --> 28:38.717
you got heat lamps
at every party in Los Angeles.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.588
And nobody thinks twice
if there's a stack

28:40.631 --> 28:42.198
of backup tanks lying around.

28:42.242 --> 28:44.897
There was welding equipment
at their warehouse.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.376
They rigged the tanks
so all they have to do

28:46.420 --> 28:47.464
is set 'em up
and walk away.

28:47.508 --> 28:49.379
Valves open, MIC vaporizes,

28:49.423 --> 28:52.208
injuring or killing anyone
in the immediate area.

28:52.252 --> 28:54.384
They get to claim "victory"
online, get publicity...

28:54.428 --> 28:55.908
Spread their
racist message further.

28:55.951 --> 28:58.867
Maybe even start
the war they want so badly.

28:58.911 --> 29:00.390
Let's hope it doesn't
inspire copycats.

29:00.434 --> 29:01.696
The van and the decal

29:01.740 --> 29:03.350
help sell the charade,

29:03.393 --> 29:04.786
but the Imperial Dukes
don't need any of this

29:04.830 --> 29:06.222
to carry out
their attack.
No.

29:06.266 --> 29:07.746
They're doing this
one way or another.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.573
I'm gonna call
the party rental company,

29:09.617 --> 29:11.314
get a list of
their events today.

29:11.358 --> 29:13.142
Be ready to roll out.

29:14.665 --> 29:16.842
Milk helps with eye irritation
after exposure.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.713
I'm gonna grab some
portable respirators, too.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.367
Well, hopefully,
we contain the gas tanks

29:20.410 --> 29:21.890
before it ever gets to that.

29:21.934 --> 29:23.370
Hey, Luca, we got a destination?

29:23.413 --> 29:25.111
Yeah, just got a list
of today's events

29:25.154 --> 29:26.895
from the rental company.
Five spots, all over town.

29:26.939 --> 29:28.375
All right,
target's got to be something

29:28.418 --> 29:29.898
the Dukes can promote online.

29:29.942 --> 29:31.508
Yeah.
Wedding seems too low-profile.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.162
Silent auction...
Wait, wait.

29:33.206 --> 29:35.164
Camden College is re-dedicating

29:35.208 --> 29:36.600
their Physical Sciences Lab.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.080
Yeah, read about that.
They're removing

29:38.124 --> 29:40.213
the name of some donor
who supported racist policies.

29:40.256 --> 29:42.215
It says here they're
renaming the building

29:42.258 --> 29:44.217
in honor of the Mendez family,
who fought

29:44.260 --> 29:46.001
to end segregated schooling
in Southern California.

29:46.045 --> 29:47.568
Yeah, Hill was really worked up

29:47.611 --> 29:49.222
about the "erasure of white
culture" and "losing monuments."

29:49.265 --> 29:50.876
To the Dukes,

29:50.919 --> 29:52.791
replacing a name on the wall
is worth killing over.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.618
These are exactly the type
of victims they want.

29:54.662 --> 29:57.883
The keynote speaker is
the college's diversity chair,

29:57.926 --> 29:59.188
and the event's co-sponsored
by three different

29:59.232 --> 30:00.755
BIPOC-focused clubs.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.235
Okay, ceremony starts
in an hour.

30:02.278 --> 30:03.323
Dukes might be
there already.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.025
Don't stop, let's go!

30:10.069 --> 30:11.374
Understood.

30:12.506 --> 30:14.203
Rocker, officers
are evacuating

30:14.247 --> 30:15.726
the speakers
and early arrivals.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.511
They'll keep civilians
out of the danger zone.

30:17.554 --> 30:18.947
50-Squad's gonna take
a perimeter position.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.949
Don't want any of these guys
slipping through a crack.

30:25.736 --> 30:27.390
Deacon.

30:27.434 --> 30:29.349
Event coordinator confirmed
that the rental company's

30:29.392 --> 30:31.786
deliverymen are working
on the quad.

30:38.924 --> 30:42.231
30-David,
it's the Imperial Dukes.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.278
Hey, Hondo, looks like Lewis
and the other Dukes

30:45.321 --> 30:47.149
-are arming the tanks.
-Roger that.

30:47.193 --> 30:48.411
Everybody mask up.

30:48.455 --> 30:49.848
Watch the tanks.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.545
This stuff is flammable
and deadly.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.732
Deacon, on your count.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.908
Three, two, one.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.613
-LAPD!
-Cops!

31:16.657 --> 31:18.093
Hands where we can see them!

31:19.138 --> 31:20.008
Suspect one down.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.140
Everybody, take cover!

31:23.838 --> 31:25.927
Put your weapons down.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.582
LAPD!

31:28.625 --> 31:30.671
-LAPD! Show your hands!
-Nowhere to go! Give it up!

31:35.110 --> 31:36.372
They're aiming for the tanks!

31:40.811 --> 31:42.378
Suspect two down.

32:00.179 --> 32:01.136
Move in, now!

32:06.011 --> 32:07.403
I got Lewis.

32:07.447 --> 32:09.492
Chris, I got your six.

32:09.536 --> 32:10.667
Check the tanks.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.321
No release mechanism,
just propane.

32:14.062 --> 32:15.977
Lewis is rabbiting,
headed north!

32:16.021 --> 32:18.023
Moving to intercept.

32:18.066 --> 32:20.155
26-David, with you.

32:21.722 --> 32:23.942
Got to stay on him!

32:30.861 --> 32:32.124
LAPD!

32:33.952 --> 32:35.083
Stop!

32:35.127 --> 32:37.738
Lewis turned southeast.
Following.

32:39.261 --> 32:41.524
He wants us to move in close,
leave an exit open

32:41.568 --> 32:43.309
so he can double back
and slip the net.

32:43.352 --> 32:44.397
Just tell me where to be.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.922
-I got leaking MIC!
Fowler!

32:47.966 --> 32:49.358
We need a containment
chamber now!

32:49.402 --> 32:50.577
There's toxic gas in the air.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.544
Tank's secured.
I'm checking the others.

33:05.505 --> 33:06.767
Can't use that gun, man.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.595
The gas in the air is flammable.

33:08.638 --> 33:10.640
You're breathing poison.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.557
These all look secure.

33:14.601 --> 33:16.037
On your stomach.

33:16.081 --> 33:17.908
Three down.
Fowler, we need oxygen.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.127
Roger, incoming.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.392
LAPD!

33:30.138 --> 33:31.052
Way to corral him.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.619
Final suspect down.

33:32.662 --> 33:34.273
You catch him, you clean him.

33:34.316 --> 33:36.014
With pleasure.

33:48.156 --> 33:50.028
Last of the tanks disabled.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.510
20-David. Code 4.

33:58.297 --> 34:01.822
Multiple members in custody,
propaganda machine's gone quiet.

34:01.865 --> 34:05.130
SWAT dealt the Imperial
Dukes a real blow today.

34:05.173 --> 34:08.002
FBI was able to download
the bulk of the encrypted forum

34:08.046 --> 34:09.395
before it was erased.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.484
I am putting together
a team to go through it.

34:11.527 --> 34:14.835
Lot of insight to be had on
cell organization, activities.

34:14.878 --> 34:18.230
I thought the Dukes totally
abandoned this forum. Commander.

34:18.273 --> 34:20.145
It's a new private message.

34:20.188 --> 34:23.452
"LAPD still has a chance to be
on the right side of history.

34:23.496 --> 34:24.845
War is coming."

34:24.888 --> 34:26.847
It's time-stamped
30 seconds ago.

34:26.890 --> 34:28.109
Cross-checking our records.

34:28.153 --> 34:31.025
This user communicated
with the first cell.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.201
Looks like he gave orders
to both.

34:33.245 --> 34:34.463
Brains of the operation.

34:34.507 --> 34:35.638
The leader,

34:35.682 --> 34:37.162
connection between
all the L.A. cells.

34:38.859 --> 34:42.645
And he's still out there,
planning for war.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.648
Yo, Fowler.

34:45.692 --> 34:46.823
Hey.
Hey.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.042
Decided to put in

34:48.086 --> 34:49.870
a "join my relay" team offer
after all?

34:49.913 --> 34:52.133
I already got some deals
that are gonna be tough to beat.

34:52.177 --> 34:54.701
No, my first one
nothing.

34:54.744 --> 34:57.834
Okay? No gift cards,
no all-expenses paid.

34:57.878 --> 35:00.185
Just join 20-Squad's team.

35:00.228 --> 35:01.316
Hmm, that's definitely
not gonna top

35:01.360 --> 35:02.883
the spa day from 50-Squad.

35:02.926 --> 35:04.450
You know,
I've been thinking about it.

35:04.493 --> 35:06.974
This highest bidder stuff
is noise.

35:07.017 --> 35:09.542
You turning me down
-this morning was real.
-Oh, yeah?

35:09.585 --> 35:11.674
You think you don't
fit in here at SWAT.

35:11.718 --> 35:13.241
You were trying
not to make waves,

35:13.285 --> 35:17.419
keep your head down
until Rocker upped the ante.

35:20.074 --> 35:22.859
You were in Germany
when I first started.

35:22.903 --> 35:25.645
People still aren't sure if
I even belong in this building.

35:25.688 --> 35:27.386
Don't even know why

35:27.429 --> 35:30.040
-a TEMS officer is important.
-No, I get you.

35:30.084 --> 35:32.391
So here's my real offer. Next
time that we have a night off,

35:32.434 --> 35:34.436
I'll run you through the
SWAT training course.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.177
Okay, whether you join
my team or not.

35:36.221 --> 35:39.093
I'll show you how we train,
and get the best out of you.

35:40.834 --> 35:43.880
I don't know about one time
through the course.

35:43.924 --> 35:45.839
Maybe if you offer to train me
up until I kick ass,

35:45.882 --> 35:47.493
-however long it takes.
-Yeah, okay,

35:47.536 --> 35:49.321
and I thought us SWAT guys
were the competitive ones.

35:49.364 --> 35:50.670
Hey, I can go see
if Rocker's team

35:50.713 --> 35:51.932
will offer me the same terms.

35:51.975 --> 35:54.021
No, no. We got a deal.

35:56.937 --> 35:58.939
Hey.

35:58.982 --> 36:01.376
I wanted to thank you
for keeping me busy today,

36:01.420 --> 36:03.813
taking my mind
off of everything.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.772
Well...

36:05.815 --> 36:07.556
you need help,
I'm always here for you.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.863
But you're stronger
than you know, Chris.

36:09.906 --> 36:11.995
Think I realized it
as I booked Lewis,

36:12.039 --> 36:14.041
no piece of trash
is gonna threaten my sanity.

36:14.084 --> 36:15.695
I'm glad you got some closure.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.523
No. There are more
Imperial Dukes out there,

36:17.566 --> 36:19.307
believing in the cause
that killed Erika,

36:19.351 --> 36:20.700
planning more violence.

36:20.743 --> 36:23.920
When they're gone,
that's when I'll have closure.

36:27.489 --> 36:29.056
"I didn't like her
in the first place."

36:29.099 --> 36:31.232
I'm like, "Why wouldn't
you tell me that?"

36:31.276 --> 36:33.191
It was nine years ago.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.193
Figured you guys
could use more ice.

36:35.236 --> 36:36.194
Hey, always.

36:36.237 --> 36:37.195
Deacon, nice to see you, man.

36:37.238 --> 36:38.370
Gibson and Ellis.

36:38.413 --> 36:40.241
Man, I haven't seen
you clowns in ages.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.243
-You got to catch up.
-Thanks.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.814
Here's to walking the path
with dignity.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.254
Pure of body and spirit.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.604
Told you guys.

36:57.954 --> 36:59.695
Figured you didn't want to talk
about this stuff at work,

36:59.739 --> 37:03.221
but just know,
you're among friends here.

37:05.875 --> 37:08.269
Who's ready to eat?

37:08.313 --> 37:10.315
Let's go.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.756
I ain't playing,
I ain't playing.

37:16.799 --> 37:19.498
Oh, man.
Quite a party
going on in here.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.413
You two seem to be
in better spirits.

37:21.456 --> 37:24.024
Uh, got nothing for you
to worry about anymore.

37:24.067 --> 37:26.026
Yeah, my pops ran
all those guys off.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.288
Got them to leave

37:27.332 --> 37:28.246
the whole block alone.

37:31.988 --> 37:34.426
And how exactly did
you manage that, Leroy?

37:34.469 --> 37:37.167
Stop clutching
your pearls, all right?

37:37.211 --> 37:39.300
I didn't do nothing criminal.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.520
I know you had
more than a civil chat

37:41.563 --> 37:43.173
and a handshake deal
with those guys.

37:43.217 --> 37:46.002
Those wannabes were happy
to wrap up their little scheme

37:46.046 --> 37:47.613
the second they heard my name.

37:47.656 --> 37:49.267
A Hammer O.G.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.051
What'd you do?

37:51.094 --> 37:53.227
Did you threaten to put in work
if they cross your territory?

37:53.271 --> 37:55.229
Oh, that so different
than promising to bring down

37:55.273 --> 37:57.666
the thunder of the LAPD
on their asses?

37:57.710 --> 37:59.755
Oh, I guess it is, because at
least they respected me enough

37:59.799 --> 38:01.540
to run along.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.803
-Leroy.
-Didn't need
your permission, Hondo.

38:03.846 --> 38:05.761
Damn sure don't need it
to do whatever else

38:05.805 --> 38:07.328
might be necessary.

38:09.635 --> 38:12.507
Darryl got dreams
for this place,

38:12.551 --> 38:14.292
and I'm-a see them through.

38:15.945 --> 38:17.512
Is everything okay?

38:19.122 --> 38:20.950
Yeah, sure is.

38:21.951 --> 38:22.996
So tell me about

38:23.039 --> 38:24.127
this neighborhood
business council.

38:24.171 --> 38:25.259
Mm.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.130
Help me with these cameras, kid.

38:27.174 --> 38:28.697
We still need those?

38:31.570 --> 38:35.748
Darryl, I know it looks like
your pops took care of things,

38:35.791 --> 38:38.141
but running those guys off
was not a smart thing.

38:38.185 --> 38:40.361
I thought that's what we wanted,
for them to leave us alone.

38:40.405 --> 38:41.623
Think about it, kid.

38:41.667 --> 38:43.582
Okay, so they left us,
but where'd they go?

38:43.625 --> 38:45.584
-Probably to some other block.
-And you think

38:45.627 --> 38:47.368
they learned that extorting
money from people is wrong?

38:47.412 --> 38:48.674
You think
they're just gonna stop?

38:48.717 --> 38:50.197
Probably not.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.590
Best-case scenario,

38:51.633 --> 38:53.374
they start picking on
someone else.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.637
Worst-case,
they get all worked up

38:55.681 --> 38:58.858
and decide to come and hit back
on your father, hard.

38:58.901 --> 39:00.816
Now, look, your pops,

39:00.860 --> 39:02.949
he knows what's up, and
I'm sure he's got a plan

39:02.992 --> 39:05.952
or five if it comes to that.

39:05.995 --> 39:07.693
That also worries me.

39:08.998 --> 39:10.913
But the thing is, D,

39:10.957 --> 39:12.959
sometimes a short-term solution
just creates

39:13.002 --> 39:14.830
a long-term problem.

39:14.874 --> 39:17.180
I feel you.

39:17.224 --> 39:19.792
But I don't know if the rest
of the neighborhood does.

39:21.707 --> 39:24.449
Some things take
more time than others.

39:25.754 --> 39:29.323
My son went
to a march.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.977
Doesn't understand
why it broke my heart.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.326
A couple cops

39:32.370 --> 39:33.675
making split-second
bad decisions

39:33.719 --> 39:35.285
does not mean the whole
damn system is broken.

39:35.329 --> 39:37.026
It's Monday-morning
quarterbacking.

39:37.070 --> 39:38.332
I mean, a Black suspect

39:38.376 --> 39:40.203
comes at me with something
looking like a weapon,

39:40.247 --> 39:42.118
you think I'm spending time
worrying what color he is?

39:42.162 --> 39:44.425
No. And saying so
doesn't make me a racist.

39:44.469 --> 39:45.687
All right?
It makes me a realist.

39:45.731 --> 39:47.123
No, man,
they loop us all together

39:47.167 --> 39:48.908
like we're some Imperial Dukes.
It's just ridiculous.

39:48.951 --> 39:50.562
Their type of violence?

39:50.605 --> 39:51.737
I-It makes the whole movement
-look bad.
-And it takes away

39:51.780 --> 39:53.434
the focus
of the politically correct BS

39:53.478 --> 39:55.741
-that's gone too far.
One day

39:55.784 --> 39:57.786
we're gonna look up and find
the inmates running the asylum.

39:58.874 --> 40:01.573
More like animals
running the zoo.

40:01.616 --> 40:03.401
I can't even imagine what it's
like for you every day, Deac.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.099
I'm not sure how you mean.

40:06.142 --> 40:08.667
Harrelson.

40:08.710 --> 40:12.975
I mean... Hondo's
a good guy, I guess,

40:13.019 --> 40:15.456
but everyone knows
that his promotion

40:15.500 --> 40:16.892
was affirmative action
nonsense,

40:16.936 --> 40:18.111
all about capitulating

40:18.154 --> 40:19.460
to the social justice
warrior crowd

40:19.504 --> 40:20.940
over at the city hall.

40:20.983 --> 40:23.812
He has no business being
the SWAT team leader over you.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.164
I see it in your eyes.

40:28.208 --> 40:31.603
It eats you up
to have to take orders from him.

40:31.646 --> 40:33.343
I feel you.

40:35.171 --> 40:36.434
World's gone mad.
