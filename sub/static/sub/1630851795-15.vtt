00:06.707 --> 00:08.807
<i> [jeremy] this time</i>
<i>  on moonshiners.</i>

00:08.809 --> 00:10.776
Carlos, I see you got
a lot of workers here.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.277
<i> [carlos] those are</i>
<i>  the jimadors.</i>

00:12.279 --> 00:15.314
<i>  -So, we are here in mexico.</i>
<i> -I may learn how</i>
<i> to make tequila.</i>

00:15.316 --> 00:17.983
<i>  Maybe I can bring that</i>
<i>  back to my own distillery.</i>

00:17.985 --> 00:19.485
<i>  And I'm gonna come out</i>
<i>  with something special.</i>

00:19.487 --> 00:21.453
If you're looking
for a job, please,

00:21.455 --> 00:24.156
-you will be welcome.
-[all laughing]

00:24.158 --> 00:26.492
<i>  whoa! That's a lot of</i>
<i>  bananas, man.</i>

00:26.494 --> 00:29.028
Today we're gonna start
mashing in our bananas foster.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.496
<i>  We have a lot of tried</i>
<i>  and true recipes</i>

00:30.498 --> 00:31.697
that we know make money.

00:31.699 --> 00:32.998
<i>  This is something new to us.</i>

00:33.000 --> 00:34.266
Uh, uh, this ain't right.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.635
What the hell you mean
it's not right?

00:36.637 --> 00:37.936
My aunt dolly, my dad,

00:37.938 --> 00:40.239
were born on the other side
of that mountain over there.

00:40.241 --> 00:43.008
<i> [digger] danielle parton,</i>
<i>  she wants to know</i>
<i>  what it's like</i>

00:43.010 --> 00:45.778
-make a run liquor
out of the woods.
-[danielle] lucky there.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.112
<i> [digger] when it comes</i>
<i>  to this run,</i>

00:47.114 --> 00:50.416
it's more about connecting
her family heritage.

00:50.418 --> 00:51.517
Kind of looks like,

00:51.519 --> 00:53.585
last puke from a bad night.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.323
<i> [tim] this is how we make</i>
<i>  the moonshine.</i>

00:59.193 --> 01:02.361
[country music playing]

01:06.233 --> 01:07.566
well, we see a lot of agave.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.401
We're getting close.

01:11.072 --> 01:13.705
<i> [jeremy] in the state of</i>
<i>  jalisco, mexico,</i>

01:13.707 --> 01:16.842
<i>  tim is en route from</i>
<i>  the valley city of tequila</i>

01:16.844 --> 01:18.477
<i>  to the town of arandas</i>

01:18.479 --> 01:20.512
<i>  in a region known</i>
<i>  for producing</i>

01:20.514 --> 01:23.982
<i>  some of the world's finest</i>
<i>  highland tequila.</i>

01:23.984 --> 01:25.284
<i> [tim] so, we are here</i>
<i>  in mexico,</i>

01:25.286 --> 01:27.786
I'm trying to learn as much
as I can about tequila.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.254
<i>  Lots of corn, man.</i>
<i>  Look at that.</i>

01:29.256 --> 01:30.522
<i>  I feel like, I'm at home</i>
<i>  right now.</i>

01:30.524 --> 01:32.124
Look at this,
an agave on the inside.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.193
<i>  This is really</i>
<i>  a business trip here.</i>

01:34.195 --> 01:37.096
You know, I'm really hoping
that I can learn some
different techniques,

01:37.098 --> 01:38.997
<i>  different ways</i>
<i>  of distilling alcohol.</i>

01:38.999 --> 01:40.799
I may learn,
how to make tequila.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.368
<i>  Maybe I can bring that</i>
<i>  back to my own distillery.</i>

01:43.370 --> 01:45.070
<i>  And I can come out</i>
<i>  with something special.</i>

01:45.072 --> 01:46.472
And you know, this is a road.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.873
[driver] this is the road.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.576
-I know.
-It doesn't look like
a road to a distillery to me.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.845
Today, I'm gonna meet
carlos camarena,

01:52.847 --> 01:54.480
<i>  and I'm gonna go</i>
<i>  see his distillery</i>

01:54.482 --> 01:56.014
and see how he makes tequila.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.916
<i>  You know, coming from</i>
<i>  the valley to the highlands,</i>

01:57.918 --> 01:59.852
<i>  it's a totally different</i>
<i>  atmosphere.</i>

01:59.854 --> 02:01.053
<i>  I seen little agave</i>

02:01.055 --> 02:02.387
<i>  growing in a different</i>
<i>  environment,</i>

02:02.389 --> 02:03.755
<i>  gives a different</i>
<i>  taste profile.</i>

02:03.757 --> 02:05.257
That's the gate.

02:05.259 --> 02:08.460
That is a stop gate.
I see that there's some
kind of security thing.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.262
-[driver] checkpoint.
-Checkpoint?

02:11.332 --> 02:13.198
We turn
into this back road,

02:13.200 --> 02:15.434
and all of a sudden
there's a checkpoint.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.336
<i>  Maybe we get in here,</i>
<i>  but we can't get out.</i>

02:18.038 --> 02:19.238
[driver] what happened?

02:19.240 --> 02:22.374
[speaking in foreign language]

02:23.377 --> 02:25.144
checking your
driver's license?

02:28.282 --> 02:29.982
Uh, tim, you got your id?

02:29.984 --> 02:32.251
No, I didn't bring
the id, uh, uh.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.619
[speaking in foreign language]

02:35.289 --> 02:36.455
[speaking in foreign language]

02:36.991 --> 02:38.190
they should know I'm coming.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.958
They know you're coming,
but they want to know

02:39.960 --> 02:41.927
if it's the real tim smith,
you know.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.429
-[tim] this is crazy.
-[driver] that's when
you know, tequila is money.

02:44.431 --> 02:46.031
[tim] tequila is money, huh?

02:46.033 --> 02:49.201
[speaking foreign language]

02:49.203 --> 02:52.838
[speaking foreign language]

02:52.840 --> 02:54.706
[driver] normally, they don't
let you in without id.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.742
But, they call carlos
and he let us in.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.011
<i> [tim] probably the only person</i>
<i>  to come here with no shirt.</i>

02:59.013 --> 03:00.379
<i> [driver] probably.</i>
<i> [laughs]</i>

03:00.381 --> 03:03.015
we've come a long way just
to get to the distillery here

03:03.017 --> 03:04.983
<i>  and see carlos camarena.</i>

03:04.985 --> 03:07.219
<i>  There's a lot been going on</i>
<i>  just right here.</i>

03:07.221 --> 03:10.055
It goes all the way back to
his great great grandfather

03:10.057 --> 03:11.924
<i>  and making alcohol</i>
<i>  in this region.</i>

03:11.926 --> 03:13.158
That's a big place here.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.327
Tim, welcome
to the highlands of jalisco.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.595
Finally.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.096
-How are you?
-It's a pleasure having
you here.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.097
It's been a long trip.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.699
You had to
go through security.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.901
-I apologize for
the inconvenience. But...
-No, it's okay.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.304
...Years ago there
was a lot of problem
with crime here.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.272
We still have some
security control.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.808
-[tim] wow.
-[carlos] fortunately,
you made it all the way,

03:29.810 --> 03:32.978
up from the valley of tequila
to the highlands of jalisco.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.580
Well, you know,
tequila in mexico

03:34.582 --> 03:37.015
is kind of like moonshine
in america.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.183
<i>  It's high profit.</i>

03:38.185 --> 03:39.685
<i>  There's a big demand for it,</i>

03:39.687 --> 03:41.153
<i>  but it's also dangerous.</i>

03:41.155 --> 03:43.355
Someone is out there
trying to get these guys

03:43.357 --> 03:45.958
because they know they
the ones who's making money.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.226
I've learned that a lot.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.962
Uh, the little short time
I've been in mexico,

03:49.964 --> 03:52.664
not a lot of people
know about moonshine,

03:53.467 --> 03:55.934
but I see cornfields
everywhere.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.136
-Right.
-It should be making
corn liquor.

03:58.138 --> 04:01.540
But then again, I see a lot of
agave fields everywhere too.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.142
In this area,
agave is the main thing,

04:04.144 --> 04:05.811
we usually use the corn

04:05.813 --> 04:07.846
to feed our cattle
and to feed ourselves.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.916
-Yeah, yeah.
-I mean, mexico tortillas,
tacos.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.351
-I see that.
-Yes.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.820
It looked like you slide
a little corn to the side.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.155
Make a little corn liquor,
somebody.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.423
I know a little bit
about tequila,

04:18.425 --> 04:19.925
but not exactly
about moonshine.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.327
-So I need your expertise.
-I know, a whole
lot about corn liquor.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.796
-I know.
-Just spending a little bit of
time with carlos.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.699
You can tell he's very
passionate about his business.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.002
-[carlos] all right.
-[tim] I see you got
a big tank here.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.237
Yes, my grandfather,

04:32.239 --> 04:34.973
uh, started distilling
tequila here

04:34.975 --> 04:36.308
in 1937.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.376
<i> [tim] oh, look at that.</i>

04:48.389 --> 04:50.122
<i> [digger] it's something</i>
<i>  to work on their head.</i>

04:51.025 --> 04:53.425
[bleep]
we bumped into everything,

04:53.427 --> 04:56.561
I ran over the lawnmower
in the yard with
my truck yesterday.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.130
What are y'all doing?

04:58.132 --> 04:59.865
-Hey, honey.
-Hi, how are you?

04:59.867 --> 05:01.733
-Good to see you.
-Hey.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.869
We got a call
from danielle parton.

05:03.871 --> 05:06.438
<i>  We met danielle</i>
<i>  through her aunt dolly.</i>

05:06.440 --> 05:08.740
We've also had her
as a guest judge

05:08.742 --> 05:10.475
<i> on master distiller.</i>

05:10.477 --> 05:12.044
You ever used
a blender before?

05:12.046 --> 05:13.412
Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.914
That's a technique,
I ain't never seen
in a kitchen.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.449
I'll give you that much.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.484
What in the world
are y'all working on?

05:19.486 --> 05:21.853
-Well--
-well, this is an old burner.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.122
So, yeah, these are all
homemade we make them.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.024
It ain't rocket science,
you know.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.093
But, you didn't take
a college degree for this.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.828
Speaking of college degrees

05:29.830 --> 05:31.296
we're just curious.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.032
Why you would be paying us

05:34.034 --> 05:35.434
of all people to visit?

05:35.436 --> 05:38.837
Some people call it curious,
some of us call it concern.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.106
Well, I was wondering,
I know how to make liquor.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.908
-Obviously, I make my own.
-[digger] yes, you did.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.143
But I've never
made it outdoors

05:45.145 --> 05:47.446
the old fashioned way,
the way my grandparents
did it.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.381
My aunt dolly, um, her dad,

05:49.383 --> 05:51.316
my pawpaw was a moonshiner

05:51.318 --> 05:54.219
have recently in the last year
bought into a distillery.

05:54.221 --> 05:57.055
<i>  Distilling outside, it's just</i>
<i>  a way to get in touch</i>

05:57.057 --> 05:58.924
with my family roots.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.425
I've just never
cooked outside,

06:00.427 --> 06:01.760
I've never mashed outside,

06:01.762 --> 06:03.895
but I would really
kind of like to learn

06:03.897 --> 06:06.031
how to do it like
my grandfather used to do it,

06:06.033 --> 06:08.633
and my great grandfather
out in the woods.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.535
I was wondering
if I could beg and impose of

06:10.537 --> 06:12.204
you guys to maybe teach me.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.406
-Well.
-Well.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.608
We ain't above it.
I can assure you.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.410
What kind of liquor
you want to make?

06:18.412 --> 06:20.445
I've never made a brandy.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.581
Oh, well, we love
making brandies.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.182
-What kind of brandy?
-So I was thinking,

06:24.184 --> 06:25.817
maybe, uh, cranberry apple.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.953
Tell you what?
We'll furnish the steel.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.889
You furnish the location
and the ingredients.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.958
And your first challenge
will be

06:32.960 --> 06:34.259
to find you a still site.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.327
What are my requirements?

06:35.329 --> 06:36.962
Give me my checklist.
I'm ready.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.297
Water, we need a pretty good
flowing stream.

06:39.299 --> 06:40.499
-Good water.
-[mark] head cover.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.300
Which is leaving us fast,

06:42.302 --> 06:43.969
uh, seclusion.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.337
-Yes, sir.
-Um,

06:45.339 --> 06:46.371
pretty much, that's about it

06:46.373 --> 06:47.939
and where we can get within,

06:47.941 --> 06:50.242
you know, rock throwing
distance with the vehicle.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.344
-Okay.
-Make it easy on two old guys.

06:52.346 --> 06:54.880
I think, I've got a place
in mind, I think
this will work.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.182
-[digger] yeah,
that's gonna work with you.
-[mark] yeah, that's okay.

07:10.464 --> 07:13.231
Bananas, that's what
we've been looking for.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.000
You knew it was me, huh?

07:15.035 --> 07:17.068
Who else will come here
and get all these bananas?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.403
-Yo, man.
-How are you doing, sir?

07:18.405 --> 07:20.105
Just some good ones
I'll be getting, huh.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.074
<i> [jeremy] in new iberia,</i>
<i>  louisiana,</i>

07:23.076 --> 07:24.910
<i> richard and craig are creating</i>

07:24.912 --> 07:27.145
<i>  a custom bananas</i>
<i>  foster liquor</i>

07:27.147 --> 07:28.280
<i>  for a new orleans chef</i>

07:28.282 --> 07:30.782
<i>  using spiced rum as a base.</i>

07:30.784 --> 07:32.818
<i> [richard] we already have</i>
<i>  the crucial component</i>
<i>  in our drink.</i>

07:32.820 --> 07:35.086
We have the spiced rum
with all our flavors in it.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.156
Today, we're gonna start
mashing our bananas,
foster part of it.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.926
<i>  So, we're gonna mash</i>
<i>  in some bananas and some</i>
<i>  sugar cane together,</i>

07:40.928 --> 07:43.862
and we can get our bananas
foster out of the still
as quick as possible.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.597
Feel like donkey kong, man.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.933
[craig] hey, man, I got
the sugar cane. Whoa!

07:47.935 --> 07:49.134
What the hell!

07:49.136 --> 07:51.036
[richard] I was just trying
to make some good shine boy.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.771
<i> [craig] man, that's a lot of</i>
<i>  bananas, man.</i>

07:52.773 --> 07:55.106
<i> [richard] I wanted to just get</i>
<i>  the machete and start</i>
<i>  whacking.</i>

07:55.108 --> 07:57.042
<i>  We got to take the tops off</i>
<i>  and the bottom off.</i>

07:57.044 --> 07:58.910
<i>  And I mean,</i>
<i>  that's a long process.</i>

07:58.912 --> 08:00.545
<i>  It doesn't take long</i>
<i>  to peel one banana,</i>

08:00.547 --> 08:03.682
but think of peeling
300 pounds of bananas.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.183
Some new guys, man.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.118
These guys got money,
this new orleans, man.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.987
Yeah, it's a lot of
high rollers out there.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.555
Yeah, man, you got to
be a high roller.

08:10.557 --> 08:13.191
You're asking somebody
to make a bananas foster
moonshine.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.193
I guarantee.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.895
<i>  We have a lot of tried</i>
<i>  and true recipes</i>

08:16.897 --> 08:19.164
that we know make money.
This is something new to us.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.999
<i>  So, the upside for this is,</i>

08:21.001 --> 08:22.901
<i>  if we impress our buyer</i>
<i>  in new orleans,</i>

08:22.903 --> 08:25.003
<i>  this can open up</i>
<i>  a whole new market for us.</i>

08:25.005 --> 08:27.506
So when we finish
with all these, what are
we gonna do next?

08:27.508 --> 08:29.007
We're gonna boil them down,

08:29.009 --> 08:30.342
add the sugar cane to it.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.511
Everything that
we've needed to achieve

08:32.513 --> 08:34.846
as far as taking out things
we don't want in it,

08:34.848 --> 08:35.981
it'll be done.

08:37.384 --> 08:40.118
I think this is the end
of the line right here, man.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.054
-Oh.
-[craig] see how heavy
this is, come on.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.723
-Pick it up.
Take it over there.
-[richard] oh.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.458
[craig] that's a couple
of hundred pounds of bananas.

08:46.460 --> 08:47.859
That's what it feels like.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.228
Now, that we have
our pot full of bananas.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.197
We're gonna start
adding some water,

08:52.199 --> 08:53.465
<i>  light our burner,</i>

08:53.467 --> 08:54.666
<i>  bring it to a boil.</i>

08:57.304 --> 08:59.371
You know, we've got to
bring to the party nano.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.506
Now, we've got to chop up
some sugarcane.

09:01.508 --> 09:04.342
Oh yeah. I'm getting a little
bit ahead of ourselves.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.178
<i>  The thing about</i>
<i>  cane sugar is all they're</i>

09:07.180 --> 09:09.147
<i>  very, very, very sugary.</i>

09:09.149 --> 09:11.716
They have a real high
sucrose content to them,

09:11.718 --> 09:13.985
<i>  so we don't need</i>
<i>  a whole lot of this stuff,</i>

09:13.987 --> 09:15.921
just enough clean sugar

09:15.923 --> 09:17.355
to bring a real true
taste through.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.157
[craig] yeah,
I think it's ready, man.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.726
Let's pour in
and cool it down.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.728
Now we have a sweet banana

09:23.730 --> 09:25.096
<i>  with its own sugars</i>

09:25.098 --> 09:26.965
<i>  and these cane sugars</i>
<i>  that we provided to it.</i>

09:26.967 --> 09:28.366
<i> Once we pitch our yeast in it,</i>

09:28.368 --> 09:29.367
<i>  they're gonna</i>
<i>  have a field day.</i>

09:29.369 --> 09:30.835
This thing is gonna blow up.

09:30.837 --> 09:33.271
All right, craig,
we cooled it enough, man.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.440
-[craig] ready for the yeast.
-[richard] yeah,
let's pitch that.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.945
<i>  Just what we have right now</i>
<i>  as a base is awesome.</i>

09:39.947 --> 09:43.014
<i>  We're starting out</i>
<i>  with a solid foundation.</i>

09:43.016 --> 09:45.450
<i>  You see this vanilla</i>
<i>  right here is gonna</i>
<i>  give a nice,</i>

09:45.986 --> 09:47.319
<i>  pleasant flavor.</i>

09:47.321 --> 09:49.154
<i>  Just that little</i>
<i>  bit of vanilla.</i>

09:49.156 --> 09:51.189
<i>  You would think would not</i>
<i>  be enough to do anything.</i>

09:51.191 --> 09:52.791
<i>  Well, sir, you will be</i>
<i>  sadly mistaken.</i>

09:52.793 --> 09:55.060
<i>  I could take this banana</i>
<i>  mash right now</i>

09:55.062 --> 09:57.429
and just put it straight
on top of a bowl of ice cream,

09:57.431 --> 09:59.397
and you'll think you had
one of the most awesome

09:59.399 --> 10:00.999
banana desserts ever.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.867
All right, we'll come back
in a few days.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.202
We're caramelizing up.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.642
[country music playing]

10:18.752 --> 10:21.486
<i> [tim] all right. You got</i>
<i>  a bunch of stills here.</i>

10:21.488 --> 10:25.090
The three generations
are represented
in this distilling room,

10:25.092 --> 10:27.993
six different stills
of all made of copper.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.028
Different sizes
and different shapes.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.964
I came to mexico to learn
as much as I can about tequila

10:32.966 --> 10:34.099
and how it's made.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.801
<i>  Carlos' distillery,</i>
<i>  this is something to behold.</i>

10:36.803 --> 10:38.970
You can recognize
the different eras.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.940
These two stills were
installed by my grandfathers,

10:41.942 --> 10:44.809
and these ones were
installed by my father

10:44.811 --> 10:47.012
as he was a chemical engineer.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.214
He designed this
with a retort,

10:49.216 --> 10:51.249
so we have some return here.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.984
The effect of
this double distillation

10:52.986 --> 10:55.253
is almost the effect of
a triple distillation.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.822
So, it comes out
a cleaner spirit.

10:57.824 --> 11:01.226
But to me, it lacks
a little bit of character.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.396
-Oh.
-So, two years ago,
it was my turn

11:04.398 --> 11:06.698
to add a new set of stills,

11:06.700 --> 11:08.967
and they are the same design

11:08.969 --> 11:11.936
as the ones
that my grandfather installed.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.039
<i>  So, let's see</i>
<i>  what is coming out here.</i>

11:14.041 --> 11:16.474
<i> [tim] he's actually got four</i>
<i>  of the six stills running.</i>

11:16.476 --> 11:19.444
This is the hot that's
coming out right now.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.712
I hope you don't mind

11:20.714 --> 11:22.447
drinking out of a cow horn,

11:22.449 --> 11:23.581
tasting a little bit?

11:24.151 --> 11:25.450
-Cow horn?
-Like this.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.986
Now, why we have
to drink it out of a cow horn?

11:27.988 --> 11:29.587
If you have ever wondered,

11:29.589 --> 11:32.657
why the people make
shots with tequila.

11:32.659 --> 11:33.925
This is the answer.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.299
<i> [carlos] I hope you don't mind</i>
<i>  drinking out of a cow horn.</i>

11:41.301 --> 11:43.868
No, but, why we have to
drink it out of a cow horn.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.969
The cow horn,

11:44.971 --> 11:46.671
that is part of history
of tequila.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.506
Sometimes history gets lost.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.242
<i> [tim] we're at the distillery</i>
<i>  with carlos camarena.</i>

11:51.244 --> 11:52.911
<i>  He's fifth generation</i>
<i>  distiller,</i>

11:52.913 --> 11:56.114
84 years of business
right here on this location.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.450
[carlos] so, the size
and the shape of
the shot glasses

11:58.452 --> 12:00.385
and the shots came
out of this shot.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.953
Imagine a 100 years ago,

12:01.955 --> 12:03.288
everything was by horse,

12:03.290 --> 12:05.724
so there was no way
to get regular glassware.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.358
So, when a cow was sacrificed,

12:07.360 --> 12:09.327
they would cut the cow horn

12:09.329 --> 12:10.762
and this was
the regular glass.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.797
This is like a homemade
shot glass, I guess.

12:12.799 --> 12:16.034
That's right, but if there's
a group of people waiting,

12:16.036 --> 12:17.469
you have to shoot it down
and pass it on

12:17.471 --> 12:20.371
because there's someone
waiting for the glass.

12:20.373 --> 12:23.041
So, this is part of
this history of tequila

12:23.043 --> 12:25.143
that nobody almost
knows anymore.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.445
So, you have to drink out of
a cow horn,

12:27.447 --> 12:29.180
so we can keep
this history alive.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.517
Never even thought about it

12:32.519 --> 12:33.885
because I don't know
the history.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.354
You know, it's always
take a shot of tequila.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.289
Well, I'm third generation,

12:38.291 --> 12:40.091
also distiller,

12:40.093 --> 12:41.726
but I am first generation
legal.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.895
And if I may ask

12:43.897 --> 12:46.197
what made you become legal?

12:46.199 --> 12:49.467
Actually, I wanted to carry on
the heritage and tradition,

12:49.469 --> 12:51.035
but I want to teach my son,

12:51.037 --> 12:52.737
but I didn't want him
to have to be

12:52.739 --> 12:54.272
looking behind his back
all the time.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.407
So, now he can do it
without any fear.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.343
We just got to pay
the government the taxes.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.378
-I fully understand
what you say about.
-You're doing the same thing.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.013
I'm doing exactly the same.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.883
Tomorrow two of my daughters
are coming with us.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.718
They are part also
of our business

13:06.720 --> 13:08.720
and they are learning
how to make tequila.

13:08.722 --> 13:11.055
So you will see that
the tradition
will keep on going

13:11.057 --> 13:14.292
because now we are preparing
the next generation
to take over.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.427
I can see that the passion

13:16.429 --> 13:20.064
of carlos to pass on that
knowledge and tradition

13:20.066 --> 13:21.633
onto the next generation.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.871
Have you seen how everyone
after making a shot,

13:26.873 --> 13:28.740
they put the glass down,
like this.

13:28.742 --> 13:30.208
'cause you can't leave it
like that.

13:30.911 --> 13:31.910
Done.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.312
This is how everything began.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.914
I'm learning something
every day.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.515
[carlos] and also tomorrow
we are going

13:37.517 --> 13:38.716
to the harvesting field.

13:38.718 --> 13:40.251
I will recommend
that you wear a shirt,

13:40.253 --> 13:42.353
otherwise you will get itchy.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.088
<i> [tim] that's good to know,</i>
<i>  I have to wear a shirt.</i>

13:44.090 --> 13:45.390
<i> [carlos] yes, please.</i>

13:54.568 --> 13:55.900
<i> [digger] this is it.</i>

13:55.902 --> 13:57.035
[danielle] this is it.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.404
Think this is secluded enough.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.972
I think, it'll work.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.440
My aunt dolly, my dad

14:02.442 --> 14:04.742
were born on the other side
of that mountain over there

14:04.744 --> 14:06.544
and that's where
my pawpaw, lee parton

14:06.546 --> 14:08.847
ran some of his shine,
when he was making.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.281
<i>  Moonshining is just</i>
<i>  a way of life here.</i>

14:10.283 --> 14:11.916
My pawpaw, lee parton,

14:11.918 --> 14:15.286
uh, bootlegged and moonshined
to support a growing family.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.155
And I know we got some water
back that way.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.457
Let's go check it out
if you want to see
what we can do.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.726
<i> [digger] now,</i>
<i> danielle is a legal distiller,</i>

14:21.728 --> 14:23.461
but she's never made
any liquor

14:23.463 --> 14:25.463
the old-fashioned way
out here in the elements.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.465
[danielle] just step over this
little hump right here

14:27.467 --> 14:29.067
is where you're gonna
find our water.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.201
<i> [tim] plenty of water.</i>

14:30.203 --> 14:31.603
<i> -[mark] now...</i>
<i> -[digger] clear.</i>

14:31.605 --> 14:34.138
...Did you have in mind
for a still site?

14:34.140 --> 14:35.907
Well, I was thinking
there's a little

14:35.909 --> 14:37.842
clearing up here
with a little more

14:37.844 --> 14:39.010
-trees and stuff,
-yeah.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.012
And that's also close to
where I think what might

14:41.014 --> 14:43.548
-have once been a still
in the older days.
-[digger] yeah.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.316
Well, we're following
your lead.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.252
-[digger] you take us where
you think...
-[mark] we're going.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.487
-You need to put a still site
and we'll look.
-All right.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.022
[digger] let's see
what we got.

14:51.024 --> 14:54.058
Step one if you want to make
backwoods liquor,

14:54.060 --> 14:56.928
<i>  you've got to find</i>
<i>  your backwoods still site.</i>

14:56.930 --> 14:59.931
[danielle] well, here's
that old metal
I was telling you about

14:59.933 --> 15:01.900
that I thought might have been
an old still site.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.302
So, it could very well be
it's all galvanized

15:04.304 --> 15:05.436
and that's what
they made them

15:05.972 --> 15:07.739
silver clouds out of.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.074
[digger] well, I turned
in here, ramsey is actually
smart for it.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.709
-[danielle] it gots to
be there.
-[digger] not only is

15:11.711 --> 15:14.245
it been a still,
it got cut at one time.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.581
Yeah, I'd say
that this is definitely

15:16.583 --> 15:18.116
a silver cloud still.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.552
They were called that
because when the moon
was full,

15:21.554 --> 15:23.321
-it would shine on them.
-Oh, yeah.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.622
A little bit and reflecting,

15:24.624 --> 15:27.058
that's why they call 'em
silver clouds.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.326
Good chances,

15:28.328 --> 15:30.895
your ancestors made
liquor on that very still.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.063
Probably, very true.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.532
-[mark] ain't it pretty cool?
-That is cool.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.567
<i> [danielle] well, one of</i>
<i>  the reasons I want to run</i>
<i>  in the woods</i>

15:36.569 --> 15:38.803
is just so I can feel
what it was like

15:38.805 --> 15:40.238
when my grandparents
was doing it.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.406
<i>  You know, the fact</i>
<i>  that we found</i>

15:41.408 --> 15:43.341
<i>  what was probably</i>
<i>  an old still at one time</i>

15:43.343 --> 15:46.311
makes me feel good
about this being
a current still site.

15:46.313 --> 15:50.381
[mark] I think that you
have found the perfect spot.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.784
Really, it has everything
that we need,

15:52.786 --> 15:54.052
everything we're looking
for.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.787
Man, digger had
to look 40 places

15:55.789 --> 15:58.056
before we could ever
choose a spot.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.825
Well, you should have
called me. Don't I look
like a mountain woman?

16:00.827 --> 16:04.562
Well, yeah, and you damn
sure talk like one.
I love that.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.231
Even though I wear, you know,
lipstick, bleached my hair,

16:07.233 --> 16:08.466
have my fake nails, whatever.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.868
I'm just as comfortable
in the woods,

16:10.870 --> 16:13.004
especially here
in east tennessee
as I am anywhere.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.106
All we need now to get
the equipment in here,

16:15.108 --> 16:18.276
which brings me to,
we'll bring the equipment,

16:18.278 --> 16:19.877
you get the ingredients.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.946
How much of what everything
do I need?

16:21.948 --> 16:24.882
Yeah, we'll need about 30,
35 pound of apples

16:24.884 --> 16:26.551
-somewhere
in that neighborhood.
-Okay.

16:26.553 --> 16:30.722
And then cranberries
about 10, 12 pound

16:30.724 --> 16:32.523
fifty pound sack sugar.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.826
-Just white sugar?
-Yeah, we'd rather have
one sack

16:34.828 --> 16:36.060
instead of 50 little ones.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.962
-Oh, darn it.
-Or 10 small ones.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.697
And a partridge
in a pear tree.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.667
-Yeah.
-Yeah, we'll be singing that
after you get that brandy.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.202
Exactly. Well, I can't think
of anybody

16:44.204 --> 16:46.104
that I'd rather be
in the backwoods with...

16:46.106 --> 16:47.972
Two old backwoods hillbillies.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.340
I'll know what you're doing
out here.

16:51.077 --> 16:53.478
[intense music playing]

17:00.387 --> 17:03.488
man, look at that thing, man,
you can hug this thing.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.890
Look at that, it's nice.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.258
That's when you got
good mash.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.395
I could see the vapors
comin' off of it.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.031
<i> [richard] today,</i>
<i>  we're back at the still</i>
<i> site and this mash is working.</i>

17:13.033 --> 17:15.333
I mean, it's really bubbling,
it's real hot.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.401
Yeah, that's a thick cap.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.269
<i>  This thing has a huge cap</i>

17:18.271 --> 17:20.038
<i>  it's probably six to eight</i>
<i>  inches.</i>

17:20.040 --> 17:23.941
And you know, it's not typical
you see a big, huge cap
like that in the ferment.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.411
This will probably be ready
in the day, man.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.479
-Look at that, vanilla bean.
-Vanilla bean.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.549
While we're lettin'
this work off,

17:31.551 --> 17:33.284
we'll go ahead and macerate
our nuts,

17:33.286 --> 17:35.119
soak 'em in our base spirit.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.354
That's a real good alcohol.

17:36.356 --> 17:39.390
If we were just going
for that right there
we'd be good.

17:39.392 --> 17:43.094
In a bananas foster dessert,
it calls for nuts to be used.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.929
So, we're gonna caramelize
those today

17:44.931 --> 17:47.465
<i>  and we're gonna add 'em</i>
<i>  into our spice rum.</i>

17:47.467 --> 17:48.566
And we're gonna let them sit.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.735
We got acorns.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.637
My favorite walnuts.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.039
We're gonna go with only those
next.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.008
One of the most serious
components of this drink

17:57.010 --> 18:00.545
is that the caramelization
factor is there and you can
taste it.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.513
Yeah, we could dump some
brown sugar in here.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.417
-A little bit more.
-Look at that.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.986
-Get a whole shot right there.
-There you go, that's good,
right there.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.421
<i> [richard] when this dessert</i>
<i>  was made at first</i>

18:10.423 --> 18:12.356
in the 1950s in new orleans,

18:12.358 --> 18:14.325
it was prepared
with brown sugar,

18:14.327 --> 18:18.729
<i>  butter, cinnamon,</i>
<i>  banana liqueur, spiced rum.</i>

18:18.731 --> 18:21.632
<i>  It was flambeed table side</i>
<i>  by a chef.</i>

18:23.069 --> 18:25.269
Can you taste it in the,
in the sauce?

18:25.905 --> 18:27.405
-It's ice cream.
-It's ice cream.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.407
<i> [richard] all these things</i>
<i>  have to be done in proportion</i>

18:29.409 --> 18:32.210
and that's what we do,
we make sure that everything
is proportionate,

18:32.212 --> 18:34.712
<i>  so our flavors balance</i>
<i>  and don't kill each other.</i>

18:34.714 --> 18:36.147
That's what this drink
deserves.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.415
That tastes good.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.217
I mean, you could taste
that spice in it.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.019
-Spicy, sweet rum.
-Wow.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.222
Caramelized spiced rum.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.023
<i> [richard] I think that's just</i>
<i>  enough, right there.</i>

18:46.025 --> 18:47.859
<i>  It's strong, that's for sure.</i>

18:47.861 --> 18:50.328
Everything's complimented
with each other real well.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.163
We have some bitterness,
some sweetness,

18:52.165 --> 18:54.232
some tanginess, some tartness
in this.

18:54.234 --> 18:58.169
<i>  In the end, this tastes</i>
<i>  like a creamy textured.</i>

18:58.171 --> 19:00.738
Yeah, we'll let these sit
for a day or two.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.473
So when we come back,
we could just jump straight

19:02.475 --> 19:04.876
in the...Popping everything
into the barrel.

19:04.878 --> 19:06.277
<i>  I thought this was bananas,</i>
<i>  man,</i>

19:06.279 --> 19:08.880
<i>  but just just plain nuts.</i>
<i>  No pun intended.</i>

19:08.882 --> 19:12.016
[country music playing]

19:21.094 --> 19:22.493
[danielle] good mornin'.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.695
-You got it, girl.
-I got it.

19:25.431 --> 19:26.731
That look like it'll do?

19:26.733 --> 19:28.332
Oh, yeah.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.934
Cranberry, apple.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.370
Well, you know, danielle,
she wants to know
what it's like

19:32.372 --> 19:34.071
<i>  to make a run liquor</i>
<i>  out in the woods</i>

19:34.073 --> 19:36.174
on an old-fashioned pot still.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.543
[mark] you should have
got you a pair of overalls.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.977
[danielle] I should have.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.980
[mark] the good thing about
overall is that they don't fit
real tight

19:42.982 --> 19:46.017
unless you're really,
really fat and buy
the wrong size.

19:46.019 --> 19:49.320
-What if you're just
regular fat?
-Cool down, like me,

19:49.322 --> 19:51.055
then you breathe
heavy like this.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.491
[sighs]

19:53.493 --> 19:54.992
I'll keep that in mind.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.565
<i> [danielle] we have water,</i>

20:00.567 --> 20:02.967
colder than a well digger's
heiny too.

20:03.937 --> 20:05.937
-Okay,
-lucky there.

20:05.939 --> 20:09.407
<i> [mark] danielle,</i>
<i>  she has ran moonshine,</i>
<i>  she's made liquor,</i>

20:09.409 --> 20:13.377
but she is anxious
to learn the backwoods way.

20:13.379 --> 20:17.448
Also, her family back
in the day was in moonshine

20:17.450 --> 20:20.318
and I think she's chasing her
heritage a little bit.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.053
[digger] we got apples.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.255
We got you cranberries.

20:24.257 --> 20:27.325
-[digger] let's get this
little green rascal going in.
-[danielle] okay.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.331
[digger] now you see,
how that looked,
kind of, like a french fry.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.699
-Yeah.
-This ain't...

20:35.802 --> 20:37.034
...Artificial sweetener.

20:37.036 --> 20:40.137
Pectic enzyme,
now rub it around
the other finger.

20:40.139 --> 20:42.506
-Now you see how the juice
is starting to come out of it.
-Hmm-hmm.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.742
I mean, there's nine million
little bitty

20:44.744 --> 20:47.078
bugs in there chewing up
[bleep] your hand.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.480
Breaking the pectin down
is releasing the juices,

20:49.482 --> 20:51.549
need to cut those
long chain sugars

20:51.551 --> 20:54.018
into little small bite sized
pieces for the yeast.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.386
They work a whole lot easier.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.355
-We always used to cook
back in the old days...
-Mm-hmm.

20:57.357 --> 21:00.258
...But we've learned
pectic enzyme

21:00.260 --> 21:03.461
does the same thing,
and it leaves more
flavor behind.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.129
All right.
Here's the fun part.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.298
Just like kneading dough,

21:07.300 --> 21:09.934
[danielle] well, I can
notice it. You know,
it's getting a lot juicier.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.403
-[mark] that's what it does.
-I think the magic is working.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.972
[mark] see how much better
that flavor is already.

21:17.010 --> 21:19.377
Did I mention
you're not supposed
eat pectic enzyme.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.047
So, what are we doing now?

21:23.116 --> 21:27.051
[mark] all that needs now
is put in some water
with, with some sugar

21:27.887 --> 21:29.787
and yeast it up
right good.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.255
[danielle] I know we're gonna
mix it all up,

21:31.257 --> 21:33.257
but do you have an order
you like to go in?

21:33.259 --> 21:34.892
It really don't matter.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.261
Just don't cook apples
whole lot, so we can dump
that sugar in there.

21:37.263 --> 21:40.064
-Then we'll dump
that water on top of it.
-Okay.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.966
Do you think we need
the whole 50 pounds of sugar?

21:41.968 --> 21:43.734
[digger] no, I think,
we could just need a...

21:43.736 --> 21:45.836
-...About a half of that.
Yeah.
-About half?

21:45.838 --> 21:48.406
I'll be making
my own moonshine
starting from scratch.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.107
<i>  I've had some bad disasters</i>

21:50.109 --> 21:52.143
<i>  and it's just, I want</i>
<i>  to be the best</i>

21:52.145 --> 21:54.011
<i>  and know as much as</i>
<i>  I can in this industry.</i>

21:54.013 --> 21:55.479
<i>  Well done.</i>

21:55.481 --> 21:57.515
<i> [danielle] they definitely</i>
<i>  have the experience</i>
<i>  and the knowledge</i>

21:57.517 --> 22:00.318
and expertise to teach me
how to make a brandy.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.853
[mark] I mean, I feel pretty
honored to be...

22:02.855 --> 22:06.357
...On your first outside
run in the woods.

22:06.359 --> 22:09.126
Brandy on family property.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.228
[mark] boy, it's pretty mash.

22:11.230 --> 22:13.064
-[digger] oh yeah,
-[slurps]

22:13.066 --> 22:15.766
-[digger] damn, it's tasty.
-[mark] mother of pearl.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.369
[mark] it's damn top
notch mash.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.307
As much as you want,
throw in there,
it don't matter,

22:23.309 --> 22:26.110
[digger] you can't over
pitch yeast.

22:26.112 --> 22:29.980
[mark] there ain't no need
to put down slop jar for
laying it either.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.450
[digger] that little critters,
they'll be eating
that sugar up

22:32.452 --> 22:35.786
the pissing out that alcohol,
farting out that co2.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.289
[mark] I say, we lay the lid
on that and skedaddle,

22:38.291 --> 22:40.491
and ain't nothing
we can help it do now.

22:40.493 --> 22:43.728
-[danielle] nothing we can do.
-[mark] it's up to time now.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.497
-[danielle] all right.
-[mark] the moonshine gods.

22:46.499 --> 22:49.266
<i> [mark] will come back</i>
<i>  with danielle at</i>
<i>  the appropriate time.</i>

22:49.268 --> 22:50.634
We'll keep an eye on it.

22:50.636 --> 22:53.938
[digger] when you see that
first damn drop come out
of that worm...

22:53.940 --> 22:55.806
<i> -[digger] you'll forget</i>
<i>  all about this.</i>
<i> -[danielle] about the work?</i>

22:55.808 --> 22:57.041
<i> [digger] yeah.</i>

23:06.452 --> 23:08.719
[richard] look, man,
you left your girl.
Go down, man.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.054
[craig] oh, she flopped.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.522
[richard] you're supposed
to take care of her.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.324
[craig] no, no, man.

23:13.326 --> 23:15.025
You were supposed
to take care.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.827
<i> [richard] so, today we're back</i>
<i>  at the still site.</i>

23:16.829 --> 23:18.896
We got our mash
working for our
bananas foster.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.598
We're gonna see
if it's ready to run.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.167
Man, look how thick that cap
is on that thing.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.002
Look at that.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.837
Seven, eight inches, huh?

23:26.839 --> 23:30.207
This is a big, huge cap,
man this is ready to go.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.143
All the bananas were
at the bottom of this barrel,

23:32.145 --> 23:33.811
when we put them into there,

23:33.813 --> 23:36.147
so that means the yeast
has had a chance to really
work through them,

23:36.149 --> 23:38.382
really pull some of the sugars
out of them,

23:38.384 --> 23:40.217
<i>  absorb those sugars</i>
<i>  and the byproduct</i>

23:40.219 --> 23:42.520
of yeast and sugar,
of course, it's alcohol.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.288
I don't know no hog farmers.

23:44.991 --> 23:46.223
I wish I did.

23:46.225 --> 23:48.025
The hogs will love us.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.160
We're just bringing this out.

23:49.162 --> 23:51.695
Pump this in
and get to cooking.

23:51.697 --> 23:53.130
[craig] come on.
Let's get it right.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.666
<i> Four buckets of the spiced rum</i>

23:56.235 --> 23:57.868
<i>  ready to go in.</i>

23:57.870 --> 23:59.437
Nuts and all everything.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.572
Man, that smells good.

24:04.477 --> 24:08.712
<i>  We've got 18 gallons</i>
<i>  of this macerated spicy rum</i>
<i>  going in right now.</i>

24:08.714 --> 24:11.482
<i>  We're gonna add</i>
<i>  that to 50 gallons of water.</i>

24:11.484 --> 24:13.717
<i>  And our 35 gallons of mash,</i>

24:13.719 --> 24:14.885
<i>  we have a maceration</i>

24:14.887 --> 24:16.253
<i>  where we took</i>
<i>  our caramelized nuts,</i>

24:16.255 --> 24:19.323
and we put them
into our spice rum
that we ran initially

24:19.325 --> 24:21.125
<i>  to get the creamy</i>
<i>  texture of milk</i>

24:21.127 --> 24:24.695
and to give us just
what we need for
our bananas foster.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.498
All right, that's it
for macerated nuts.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.301
[craig] here we go.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.070
Look like a banana sundae.

24:33.739 --> 24:34.939
[richard] good alcohol.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.373
Whoo-hoo!

24:36.375 --> 24:39.276
We went for a real low alcohol
content in this banana mash.

24:39.278 --> 24:41.312
We don't wanna clash
with other rum that we had,

24:41.314 --> 24:42.980
so we didn't use the yeast

24:42.982 --> 24:44.181
<i>  that produced the real high</i>

24:44.183 --> 24:45.549
<i>  alcohol by volume.</i>

24:45.551 --> 24:46.717
All right,
that's damn near it,

24:46.719 --> 24:48.185
man, that's almost all of it.

24:48.187 --> 24:50.154
So, this thing should be
around 12 to 14,

24:50.156 --> 24:51.555
which is what we need
to get in here.

24:51.557 --> 24:53.958
That should give
us a nice 90, 95,

24:53.960 --> 24:56.360
hopefully,
of a real good spirit.

24:56.362 --> 24:58.395
We're gonna light up.
We're gonna get
some heat under here.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.033
[craig] good deal.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.072
[richard]
that's not the look.

25:08.608 --> 25:09.974
That's perfected.

25:10.409 --> 25:11.976
<i> [craig] we have to tighten it,</i>

25:11.978 --> 25:14.311
and it's gonna take
a little while to get
the temperature

25:14.313 --> 25:16.514
<i>  and it's all playing</i>
<i>  together perfect.</i>

25:16.516 --> 25:18.115
I think
we're on the right track.

25:18.117 --> 25:21.185
-It's hot.
-[richard] yeah, we about
right here.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.053
[richard] it's getting there,
it's gonna take
a little while.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.122
So, this still under
pressure a little bit,

25:25.124 --> 25:27.825
but it's starting to do
a second form
of distillation here.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.194
Now, when this heats up
and gets under pressure

25:30.196 --> 25:32.963
and builds up enough steam
to start carrying over,

25:32.965 --> 25:35.099
now we gotta serious situation
on our hand.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.167
Yeah.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.269
It's down here.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.337
Here we go.

25:40.339 --> 25:41.505
About right there.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.008
[craig]
it's almost in the thumper.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.943
[richard] oh, yeah, we're
in the thumper already.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.878
Yeah, we should
start running here.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.647
Oh, yeah, I can smell
it coming through here, man.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.649
Do I need a bucket?

25:51.651 --> 25:54.318
-See, I get you a bucket.
-[richard] no, give me a jar.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.520
[richard]
<i>  I can start to smell things</i>
<i>  coming out of the worm, now.</i>

25:56.522 --> 25:57.688
<i>  It's getting close.</i>

25:57.690 --> 25:59.023
The banana
is definitely coming out.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.524
It smells
like the caribbean in here.

26:00.526 --> 26:02.159
<i>  I mean, you can</i>
<i>  even get the hint</i>

26:02.161 --> 26:03.494
of the spices
coming out of here.

26:03.496 --> 26:05.596
[richard]
<i>  all right, we've got a nice</i>
<i>  little drip here, man.</i>

26:05.598 --> 26:07.398
We're gonna throw
these heads off of here, man.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.233
Plenty enough heads.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.270
I'll kill all that
poison ivy, right there.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.140
Well, just let it run low
and slow like that.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.441
That's perfect, man.

26:17.443 --> 26:19.410
Everything is working.
It's dripping.

26:19.412 --> 26:22.146
We have so many
different components

26:22.148 --> 26:24.448
and one still cooking,
right now.

26:28.387 --> 26:29.987
Uh-uh, this ain't right.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.423
What the hell
you mean it's not right?

26:33.359 --> 26:34.725
No, man, something wrong.

26:36.062 --> 26:39.263
[instrumental music playing]

26:45.504 --> 26:47.304
<i>  so, I can see</i>
<i>  the dirt is different here.</i>

26:47.306 --> 26:49.940
[carlos]
<i>  yes, it's a very red clay.</i>

26:49.976 --> 26:52.276
<i>  The color of this</i>
<i>  is an iron oxide</i>

26:52.278 --> 26:54.111
<i>  that makes the agave</i>
<i>  from the highlands</i>

26:54.113 --> 26:56.880
<i>  the sweetest area</i>
<i>  to grow agave.</i>

26:56.882 --> 26:59.249
You know, this dirt here
reminds me of being at home.

26:59.719 --> 27:00.751
We have the same dirt,

27:01.087 --> 27:02.353
same weeds.

27:02.355 --> 27:04.188
I'm here with carlos
and his daughters.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.724
<i>  I visited the lower country,</i>
<i>  the valley</i>

27:06.726 --> 27:09.026
<i>  and now here,</i>
<i>  where we in the highlands,</i>

27:09.028 --> 27:10.427
<i>  there's workers working,</i>

27:10.429 --> 27:12.129
<i>  there's the tractors running,</i>

27:12.131 --> 27:15.065
<i>  there's a big dump trucks</i>
<i>  out there working.</i>

27:15.067 --> 27:16.433
<i>  These guys</i>
<i>  are serious business.</i>

27:16.435 --> 27:19.003
They are getting these
agave out of the field.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.576
<i> [richard] cut that burn off.</i>

27:25.578 --> 27:27.378
<i>  We're sipping on the drink</i>
<i>  and we're tryna figure out</i>

27:27.380 --> 27:28.712
what we're missing.
We could see that

27:28.714 --> 27:29.847
we have the creaminess.

27:29.849 --> 27:32.016
We realize we don't have
the vanilla flavor

27:32.018 --> 27:33.250
with this creaminess.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.285
This is a good stuff,
madagascar.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.287
Vanilla beans.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.789
<i>  I didn't put enough into it,</i>

27:38.791 --> 27:40.424
so we're gonna do
this as quick as possible.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.459
Try to hurry up
and get this into the thumper.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.228
<i>  And that should change it.</i>
<i>  That should give us</i>

27:44.230 --> 27:46.163
what we need as far
as the vanilla taste.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.498
I want all of it in here.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.333
<i> [craig] now that we charge</i>
<i>  the thumper,</i>

27:49.335 --> 27:50.901
<i>  we have to nail this.</i>

27:50.903 --> 27:52.202
There's no going back.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.637
We have to get this right.

27:55.408 --> 27:58.342
-[craig] oh, yeah,
she's spitting again.
-[richard] oh, we're running.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.244
<i> [richard] thought</i>
<i>  the last time</i>
<i>  was the moment of truth,</i>

28:00.246 --> 28:01.612
but this is a real moment
of truth.

28:10.489 --> 28:12.489
Now I taste vanilla,
told you, boy.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.124
-[craig] that's it?
-[richard] mm-hmm.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.459
[richard] that's it.

28:15.461 --> 28:16.694
It's good too.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.730
It's what we've been waiting
for. That's what we wanted.

28:20.700 --> 28:21.932
That's a relief.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.967
I mean, vanilla
is definitely here now.

28:23.969 --> 28:26.236
Now, this is a true
bananas foster.

28:26.238 --> 28:28.072
Now we got a bayou buffet
going on.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.240
Now we've got a true
louisiana delicacy.

28:30.242 --> 28:31.408
We just did.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.976
-That's the one.
-[richard] that's the one.

28:32.978 --> 28:34.745
-[richard] did you taste
that vanilla, man?
-I tasted.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.113
[richard] and it's not
even too strong.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.949
Now that we finally remedied
the vanilla problem,

28:38.951 --> 28:40.884
<i>  I think richard is gonna</i>
<i>  really have to fight me</i>

28:40.886 --> 28:42.753
<i>  to get this glass</i>
<i>  out of my hand.</i>

28:42.755 --> 28:45.122
It's really,
really, that good.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.024
[richard]
we've got 10 good gallons
of banana foster.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.358
That's a true banana foster.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.427
We got a five gallon bucket
for us and we got

28:50.429 --> 28:52.362
enough to satisfy our client.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.264
I mean, the chef
might know, lord knows,

28:54.266 --> 28:56.133
who it might open
some doors for us.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.202
This bananas foster,
moonshine,

28:58.204 --> 28:59.436
I think the people
in new orleans

28:59.438 --> 29:01.839
and around the area,
they're gonna freak out.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.407
What we need to do is get
in touch with our man

29:03.409 --> 29:04.975
and we need
to tidy up this site

29:04.977 --> 29:06.477
and get out of here, man.
It's getting dark.

29:06.479 --> 29:08.145
I tired, boss.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.980
I'm tired too, man,
so I'm gonna just lay back

29:09.982 --> 29:12.249
-and let you do everything.
-[richard] right on.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.451
[richard]
<i>  that'd be just a normal day</i>
<i>  at work to me.</i>

29:15.254 --> 29:18.355
[instrumental music playing]

29:27.833 --> 29:29.833
the area where we are

29:29.835 --> 29:33.303
is very close to 7,000 feet
above sea level.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.839
<i>  And because</i>
<i>  of cold conditions in winter</i>

29:35.841 --> 29:37.975
<i>  the agave takes</i>
<i>  longer to grow and mature.</i>

29:37.977 --> 29:39.743
<i> [tim] well, today, you know,</i>
<i>  it's the harvest time.</i>

29:39.745 --> 29:42.079
I come a long ways
to see every step

29:42.081 --> 29:43.881
<i>  in the process</i>
<i>  of making tequila.</i>

29:43.883 --> 29:46.116
I want to know the history,
I want to know their process,

29:46.118 --> 29:47.284
I want to know
how they distill it.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.686
[carlos] few years ago,
we had snow.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.922
It looked beautiful,
but we were very scared.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.924
-We though, it might
kill the agave plants.
-[fany] of course.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.026
<i>  On agave after we harvested</i>

29:56.028 --> 29:58.462
the agave was sweeter
than we usually have.

29:58.464 --> 29:59.997
<i> [carlos] they're more</i>
<i>  stressed,</i>

29:59.999 --> 30:01.398
<i> - the plant is...</i>
<i> -[tim] yeah.</i>

30:01.400 --> 30:03.367
<i> [carlos] ...The more sugar</i>
<i>  is concentrating...</i>

30:03.369 --> 30:05.502
-Wow.
-...As energy to
survive the winter,

30:05.504 --> 30:08.806
we can have up to 35%
sugar content.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.507
<i>  This plant</i>
<i>  is all of its life,</i>

30:10.509 --> 30:13.210
accumulating this energy
from the surroundings,

30:13.212 --> 30:15.846
and then we will
transform this energy

30:15.848 --> 30:17.481
into liquid, into tequila.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.683
<i> [tim] okay, carlos, I see,</i>
<i> you got a lot of workers here.</i>

30:19.685 --> 30:22.452
You got some guys
with the tractor,
you get the truck.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.189
<i> [carlos] the agave to grow</i>
<i>  and mature these</i>
<i>  six to seven years.</i>

30:25.191 --> 30:27.191
This field is six
and a half years.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.892
<i>  It was the time for the guys</i>

30:28.894 --> 30:32.062
<i>  to come and now</i>
<i>  harvest the agave</i>

30:32.064 --> 30:34.731
that we are transporting today
to the distillery,

30:34.733 --> 30:36.099
<i>  and start processing.</i>

30:36.101 --> 30:37.201
<i>  Those are the jimadors,</i>

30:37.303 --> 30:40.204
<i>  it's a very, very specialized</i>
<i>  and skilled job.</i>

30:40.206 --> 30:41.471
They get paid by the weight,

30:41.473 --> 30:43.173
<i>  by the amount of labor</i>

30:43.175 --> 30:45.742
<i>  they do every day.</i>
<i>  But usually the jimadors</i>

30:45.744 --> 30:48.846
are the ones that
have the best salary
in all of the area.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.047
<i>  It is a dangerous job</i>

30:50.049 --> 30:52.015
<i>  and you will see</i>
<i>  the coa is so sharp</i>

30:52.017 --> 30:55.919
<i>  that if they don't get</i>
<i>  very close attention,</i>

30:55.921 --> 30:57.321
<i>  they could cut off of it.</i>

30:57.323 --> 30:58.889
At the end of the day,

30:58.891 --> 31:00.991
the jimadors becomes
part of the heroes

31:00.993 --> 31:02.226
<i>  on what we are doing.</i>

31:02.228 --> 31:05.829
Because if you cut too much
of the leaves of the agave,

31:05.831 --> 31:07.998
my tequila will be very flat.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.134
-Oh.
-If you leave
too much of the pina,

31:11.136 --> 31:14.104
<i>  the pina is flower,</i>
<i>  the leaf is full of fibers</i>

31:14.106 --> 31:16.373
and those fibers
will produce methanol.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.008
-Mm-hmm.
-Headache.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.476
<i>  So by looking at the plant,</i>

31:19.478 --> 31:21.912
they have to determine
how much pina to remove it,

31:21.914 --> 31:23.881
how much pina to leave,

31:23.883 --> 31:26.717
<i>  in order to have</i>
<i>  the best possible balance</i>

31:26.719 --> 31:29.920
between flavor, sugar
and chemical purity...

31:29.922 --> 31:32.122
-Hmm-hmm.
-...On the distilled product.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.458
<i>  We have a good guys</i>
<i>  here harvesting</i>

31:34.460 --> 31:36.159
<i> that are the third generation,</i>

31:36.161 --> 31:38.195
<i>  they learned that skill</i>
<i>  from their father</i>

31:38.197 --> 31:40.397
and then when the father
was ready to retire,

31:40.399 --> 31:42.232
the son was
already doing that job...

31:42.234 --> 31:45.369
...But the training is usually
father to son.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.437
We have five generations
growing agave,

31:47.439 --> 31:49.239
five generations
producing tequila.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.174
We have people
from the same families

31:51.176 --> 31:52.910
-that were working
with my father...
-Hmm, hmm.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.011
With my grandfather.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.446
<i>  So right now,</i>
<i>  out of this jimadors,</i>

31:56.448 --> 31:57.447
<i>  four of them are brothers.</i>

31:57.449 --> 31:58.548
<i>  In the whole family...</i>

31:58.550 --> 31:59.917
-Hmm-hmm.
-...Is working with us.

31:59.919 --> 32:02.419
So that to us
is a sense of pride.

32:02.421 --> 32:06.323
So, don't make one guy
mad because you got
four brothers to fight.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.858
And they have
these dangerous tools.

32:07.860 --> 32:09.826
-The tools, that'll kill you.
-The coa which is too sharp,

32:09.828 --> 32:11.962
they could cut
your head off right away.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.997
-So, we don't want them
to do that.
-We should go this way.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.399
[laughing]

32:15.434 --> 32:18.268
<i> [tim] the jimador,</i>
<i>  he's the guy who's harvesting</i>
<i>  the agave,</i>

32:18.270 --> 32:20.504
and he has this coa,
which is like uh...

32:20.506 --> 32:21.972
You know, some special tool.

32:21.974 --> 32:23.307
<i>  It's very, very sharp.</i>

32:23.309 --> 32:25.142
<i>  And I mean, this guy</i>
<i>  is working this tool</i>

32:25.144 --> 32:26.843
just like,
it ain't nothing.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.111
<i> [carlos] there is a funny</i>
<i>  thing</i>

32:28.113 --> 32:30.013
about why the name pina,

32:30.015 --> 32:32.215
it kind of resembles
like a giant pineapple.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.951
-Yeah.
-When my ancestors,

32:33.953 --> 32:36.887
my great great grandfather
started bringing agave

32:36.889 --> 32:39.156
from the tequila valley
into this area,

32:39.158 --> 32:40.524
to start planting the agave.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.292
The people would come

32:42.294 --> 32:44.227
and they would
steal the little plants

32:44.229 --> 32:45.462
and taking them home

32:45.464 --> 32:46.964
because they thought
they were pineapples.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.865
<i>  To their surprise</i>
<i>  they got home</i>

32:48.867 --> 32:51.101
and they found
that they were not edible.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.536
But still, they were
calling it,

32:52.538 --> 32:54.838
pina, pina, pina
and nowadays,

32:54.840 --> 32:56.239
we keep on calling
this pina.

32:56.241 --> 32:58.175
So it is part of that history,

32:58.177 --> 32:59.943
that has to do
with my ancestors

32:59.945 --> 33:02.312
bringing the agave
into this, this area.

33:02.948 --> 33:04.214
[fany] it is a big one.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.883
-[tim] yeah.
-So that's a nice pina,

33:06.885 --> 33:08.485
<i>  quanto pesa,</i>
<i> how much it weighs?</i>

33:08.487 --> 33:09.686
[speaking foreign language]

33:09.688 --> 33:12.456
forty-two kilograms,
so about 85 pounds.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.558
<i> [tim] how much tequila</i>
<i>  can we make from that?</i>

33:14.560 --> 33:17.361
We need about eight kilograms
for one liter.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.129
So, we would make
a little over

33:19.131 --> 33:21.531
-five liters of tequila
out of this.
-Five? Five.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.900
-Yes, five liters.
-Five big bottles.

33:23.902 --> 33:25.736
Five big bottles, one liter,

33:25.738 --> 33:27.938
uh, at around 100 proof.

33:27.940 --> 33:29.506
-Okay
-so, that's good amount of--

33:29.508 --> 33:32.275
-one, two, three, four
and one extra.
-And one for the jimador.

33:32.277 --> 33:33.777
-And one for him.
-Of course.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.213
-Then there's...
-There's five bottles.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.982
Maria, if I think,
that you wanted to harvest
one of those?

33:38.984 --> 33:42.119
Yeah, sure. Each time,
I came here to the fields,

33:42.121 --> 33:44.821
chunda makes me harvest
at least one pina.

33:44.823 --> 33:47.324
So yeah, why not.
Okay.

33:47.326 --> 33:49.059
She could be hired
like a jimadors.

33:49.061 --> 33:50.227
She knows, what she's doing

33:50.229 --> 33:51.828
and she's being careful.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.764
So, that is good.

33:53.766 --> 33:56.099
<i> [tim] you know, carlos,</i>
<i>  he brings his daughters</i>
<i>  to the field.</i>

33:56.101 --> 33:57.834
<i>  They got this relationship.</i>
<i>  It's nice</i>

33:57.836 --> 34:00.470
when you come to the field,
you've got to cut one also.

34:00.472 --> 34:03.774
[carlos] she needs
to be harvesting about 200
of those per day.

34:03.776 --> 34:05.475
-Two hundred a day.
-That's what they do.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.544
It's not like her first time,
you can tell,

34:07.546 --> 34:09.179
she knows what she's doing.

34:09.181 --> 34:10.347
You want to do it tim?

34:10.349 --> 34:12.049
-Sure, I could try.
-Yeah.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.183
You didn't cut no feet off.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.885
I'm not shy about work,

34:14.887 --> 34:18.121
but this is the first time,
I've ever did anything
like this.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.290
-Nice.
<i> -[tim] once you grab</i>
<i>  that tool,</i>

34:20.292 --> 34:21.925
<i>  you know,</i>
<i>  it's got some weight to it.</i>

34:21.927 --> 34:23.927
<i>  And I was trying to be,</i>
<i>  you know,</i>

34:23.929 --> 34:26.263
professional as I can,
because I know, that's sharp.

34:26.265 --> 34:27.731
-Is it done? Is it good?
-Good job.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.299
-Yes.
-Yeah. If any time

34:29.301 --> 34:31.868
you're looking
for a job, please,

34:31.870 --> 34:34.104
you will be welcome
to harvest agave.

34:34.106 --> 34:36.306
-Sound on that.
-Good job, good job.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.542
-Thank you.
-[tim] I think I'll leave
it back to the professional.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.384
[danielle] did you taste it?

34:48.987 --> 34:51.354
Damn, that's so good,
you guys better lay down
to drink.

34:51.356 --> 34:52.923
[danielle] it is fantastic,
ain't it?

34:52.925 --> 34:55.225
It is wonderful stuff. Oh, no.

34:55.227 --> 34:56.493
[digger] that's a real
number one.

34:56.495 --> 34:57.961
Oh, no, you're falling apart.

34:57.963 --> 34:59.229
No.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.298
[mark] my ring is somewhere.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.233
-[danielle] are you serious?
-[mark] well.

35:03.235 --> 35:04.334
Reach in,
you'll find it.

35:04.336 --> 35:06.303
I ain't reaching in there.
We'll find it

35:06.305 --> 35:08.271
-when we strain
the damn stuff.
-[digger] maybe,

35:08.273 --> 35:09.806
-maybe not.
-Well.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.374
It's a better chance
to find as a team

35:11.376 --> 35:14.811
-than me prowling around.
-You realize where we're at?

35:14.813 --> 35:17.247
They might be a bear come in
here and eat all that mash up.

35:17.249 --> 35:20.016
Unfortunately,
I've lost them before.

35:20.018 --> 35:21.651
-Hmm-hmm.
-And it don't mean
you ain't married

35:21.653 --> 35:22.986
-no longer, so.
-It don't.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.392
-Morning, sunshine.
-Good morning.

35:29.394 --> 35:32.329
-You ready to make
a little brandy today, girl?
-Let's do it.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.164
Today's the day, danielle

35:34.166 --> 35:37.934
is gonna run her
apple cranberry brandy.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.169
Let's give it a look.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.037
Kind of looks like

35:41.039 --> 35:43.173
the last puke
from a bad night.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.308
That'll make it
taste appetizing.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.210
-Yeah, it really makes me
want to stick my finger...
-Yeah it is...

35:47.212 --> 35:48.612
-...In it.
-...What it looks like though.

35:48.614 --> 35:51.114
I'm pretty impressed
with this mash,
how it's worked off.

35:51.116 --> 35:52.616
But you know,
we gotta find your ring.

35:52.618 --> 35:54.518
Some things you just can't
put a price on.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.954
Well, we got to strain
this mash off anyway.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.856
I lost my ring

35:59.858 --> 36:01.258
<i>  in the mashing process</i>

36:01.260 --> 36:03.827
<i>  when we were</i>
<i>  probably stirring up</i>

36:03.829 --> 36:07.030
the pectin enzymes
into the apples.

36:07.032 --> 36:09.533
I know where it's at.
It's got to be
in the mash barrel.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.436
Well, look at it,
up jumped the devil.

36:13.438 --> 36:15.172
-There she blows.
-Lookie there.

36:15.174 --> 36:17.440
Hot damn, it's a good sign.

36:17.442 --> 36:19.609
The moonshine gods
are smiling on us.

36:19.611 --> 36:21.411
All righty, I'll take it.

36:27.319 --> 36:31.388
[upbeat music]

36:31.390 --> 36:34.057
these guys right here
are really working hard

36:34.059 --> 36:35.358
to make tequila,

36:35.360 --> 36:37.928
and you see
the, like, spherical parts

36:37.930 --> 36:39.029
that red parts.

36:39.031 --> 36:41.965
That means the agave
is completely mature.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.700
You know, the whole time
when I met carlos,

36:43.702 --> 36:44.935
<i>  he starts talking about</i>

36:44.937 --> 36:47.804
his generations
of distillers before him,

36:47.806 --> 36:49.272
<i>  and then he talks</i>
<i>  about his daughters.</i>

36:49.274 --> 36:50.774
He brings his daughters
to the field.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.542
<i>  I can see the passion</i>

36:52.544 --> 36:55.812
<i>  of carrying this heritage</i>
<i>  on to the next generation.</i>

36:55.814 --> 36:57.147
This is just the beginning.

36:57.149 --> 36:59.316
Now, we need to bring
the agave to the distillery,

36:59.318 --> 37:01.718
we need to to convert
the starch into sugar

37:01.720 --> 37:03.153
by cooking this agave,

37:03.155 --> 37:04.854
then squeeze the juice,

37:04.856 --> 37:06.423
go to create our mash,

37:06.425 --> 37:07.490
ferment everything

37:07.492 --> 37:09.359
and then double distillation.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.962
And then we can sit,
and relax, and just taste.

37:11.964 --> 37:13.263
And you will be amazed.

37:13.265 --> 37:15.031
I always think
my moonshine is the best

37:15.033 --> 37:16.600
when it comes right
straight out of that worm,

37:16.602 --> 37:18.401
-when it's right,
there, fresh.
-Exactly.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.502
It's the best.

37:19.504 --> 37:22.305
It is the same. I mean,
we have blanco tequila.

37:22.307 --> 37:24.341
We have reposado,

37:24.343 --> 37:26.343
anejo, extra anejo,
longer and longer

37:26.345 --> 37:27.477
periods in the barrel.

37:27.479 --> 37:28.712
I love them all.

37:28.714 --> 37:29.879
-Yeah.
-But usually

37:29.881 --> 37:31.448
after a few reposados
or anejo,

37:31.450 --> 37:33.016
I always come back
to the blanco

37:33.018 --> 37:35.051
-because the blanco is...
-That could've been, yeah.

37:35.053 --> 37:37.254
-...The origin,
is the source, is the art...
-It's the base.

37:37.256 --> 37:38.288
...Is the base.

37:38.290 --> 37:40.223
If you don't have
a good base,

37:40.225 --> 37:41.891
-then you don't have
nothing else.
-Exactly.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.159
Exactly.

37:43.161 --> 37:45.195
-Moonshine in the same way,
yeah.
-Yes.

37:45.197 --> 37:47.097
Preaching to the choir.

37:47.099 --> 37:48.865
<i> [tim] these guys have done</i>
<i>  harvest agave</i>

37:48.867 --> 37:51.101
<i>  and truck is on the way</i>
<i>  back to the distillery.</i>

37:51.103 --> 37:52.569
Now, we're gonna
get down to business.

37:52.571 --> 37:55.005
-I think I'm gonna take my
shirt off when I get back.
-Yes.

37:55.007 --> 37:56.106
It's getting hot out here.

37:56.108 --> 37:57.540
Give me just one hour and then

37:57.542 --> 37:59.209
-we can get our clothes off.
-Let's do it.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.113
[indistinct]

38:09.288 --> 38:10.553
<i>  I'll tell you set the burner</i>

38:10.555 --> 38:12.722
in the levellest spot,
you can find.

38:12.724 --> 38:13.990
We're setting up the still,

38:13.992 --> 38:15.225
we're gonna run this moonshine

38:15.227 --> 38:17.127
in a hauler where I've lived,

38:17.129 --> 38:19.162
<i>  on a mountain,</i>
<i>  where my family has lived.</i>

38:19.164 --> 38:20.330
This is so much fun for me

38:20.332 --> 38:22.332
and so exciting
that I get to do this.

38:24.403 --> 38:27.470
Hmm, know, the same thing,
it ought not be happening,

38:27.472 --> 38:29.005
yeah, my foot's getting wet.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.140
And why is it getting wet?

38:30.142 --> 38:32.275
Because my dumb ass
didn't check the valve.

38:32.277 --> 38:34.244
-You know, the thing
about it is...
-I always check it out.

38:34.246 --> 38:35.412
...All this ain't worth it
[bleep]

38:35.414 --> 38:36.913
if it's laying on the ground.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.182
-Hey man,
how about on my boot?
-Just, no.

38:39.184 --> 38:40.250
No, they're no good, no.

38:40.252 --> 38:41.551
It made them tasty but...

38:41.553 --> 38:44.020
-I'm damned
if I be licking them.
-I wouldn't either.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.156
You know,
I am a checklist girl,

38:46.158 --> 38:49.192
-and I did not follow
my own checklist.
-All right.

38:49.194 --> 38:51.127
Just finish it now.

38:51.129 --> 38:54.197
Yeah, as we approach,
you spill it all over
the backside of it.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.199
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

38:56.201 --> 38:57.434
-Hey, mark.
-Huh?

38:57.436 --> 38:58.968
That ain't no good
on the ground.

38:59.905 --> 39:02.839
-Touche.
-All right.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.741
We got to get
a fire built.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.409
We want to cap
that rascal off.

39:06.411 --> 39:08.311
It's just a matter
of waiting right now.

39:08.313 --> 39:10.513
So, you know,
you can put your ear
against that.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.582
It's not hot, put you ear
on it you can hear

39:12.584 --> 39:14.451
how that's thump kicking
cadillac-ing.

39:15.487 --> 39:16.886
Yeah, you can.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.955
And don't try to do that
when it's running liquor.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.024
Now, your damn finger
and your ear will be--

39:21.026 --> 39:22.058
ear will be melted, okay.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.027
They call you
danielle van gogh.

39:24.896 --> 39:27.330
You'll see puff the magic
dragon here in a minute.

39:27.332 --> 39:29.399
-[digger] yeah, it's starting.
-[danielle] there it go.

39:29.401 --> 39:33.002
[mark] cranberry,
apple brandy, hot, damn,
here we go.

39:33.405 --> 39:34.504
How do you do this?

39:35.407 --> 39:36.439
This way?

39:36.441 --> 39:38.341
-[digger] it's got to go
upside down.
-This.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.009
-The other way, there you go.
-Like that?

39:40.011 --> 39:41.311
-[digger] no.
-[danielle] no

39:41.313 --> 39:43.346
-business end first.
-Business what?

39:43.348 --> 39:46.216
This is not what I'm used
to looking at.

39:46.218 --> 39:49.352
[digger] there you go.
Look how that follows
that little pecker.

39:49.354 --> 39:51.955
[danielle] how do you, like,
sat around playing
with a coon's pecker

39:51.957 --> 39:53.356
and decided to try that?

39:53.358 --> 39:55.859
[digger] well, you know,
they used them
as a damn toothpick

39:55.861 --> 39:58.561
before they did a liquor
spout guidance system.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.731
So, who was the first one
to stick a coon pecker
in their mouth?

40:01.733 --> 40:03.867
It's always a little
adrenaline rush

40:03.869 --> 40:05.869
<i>  when you see</i>
<i>  the liquor start burning.</i>

40:05.871 --> 40:09.339
That's part of the joy of it,
watching those jars
slowly fill up.

40:09.341 --> 40:10.607
[danielle] it really is.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.942
[mark] let's give it a sample.
That's jar eight.

40:12.944 --> 40:15.245
That ought to be dead smack
in the hearts.

40:15.247 --> 40:17.981
That ought to be as good
as it's gonna get
right there.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.283
All right, y'all ready?
Here's the heart's jar.

40:27.259 --> 40:29.092
-That's good stuff.
-Let me see.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.496
[danielle] I think
we did good.
We made mountain magic.

40:33.498 --> 40:35.965
They're drinking that liquor
and they're laughing it up,

40:35.967 --> 40:37.300
<i>  bragging about</i>
<i>  how good it is.</i>

40:37.302 --> 40:39.536
And then when I taste of it,
I find out.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.971
<i>  Just like I said when</i>
<i>  we were building this mash.</i>

40:41.973 --> 40:45.809
It's some of the finest brandy
that's ever been
in the apple wines.

40:45.811 --> 40:49.012
Not a damn thing wrong
with that, except there ain't
a thousand gallons of it.

40:49.014 --> 40:52.282
Pawpaw are you proud of her?
Look here what she's done.

40:52.284 --> 40:54.184
You know, we're proud
to teach anybody

40:54.186 --> 40:56.553
we call a friend,
the art of making liquor,

40:56.555 --> 40:58.221
but it's pretty special
on this.

40:58.223 --> 41:00.557
