<i> People today are obsessed</i>
<i> with anything shiny and new.</i>

00:09.514 --> 00:13.082
<i> But it's all an illusion.</i>

00:13.084 --> 00:16.119
<i> Everything new fades.</i>

00:19.024 --> 00:22.191
<i> But forgotten hotels are</i>
<i> still good for some things.</i>

00:25.130 --> 00:29.132
<i> Drug deals.</i>

00:30.035 --> 00:32.969
<i> May-December indiscretions.</i>

00:37.943 --> 00:40.610
<i> And ending it all.</i>

00:40.612 --> 00:43.813
<i> I knew that look anywhere.</i>

00:43.815 --> 00:45.748
<i> Seen it many times.</i>

00:45.750 --> 00:49.719
<i> These two lucky birds</i>
<i> are content.</i>

00:49.721 --> 00:51.721
<i> At peace, even.</i>

00:51.723 --> 00:55.491
<i>It's their wedding anniversary,</i>
<i> they tell me.</i>

00:55.493 --> 00:57.560
<i> 60 years.</i>

00:57.562 --> 00:59.562
<i> Four kids.</i>

00:59.564 --> 01:02.332
<i> Nine grandchildren.</i>

01:02.334 --> 01:05.168
<i> They've had</i>
<i> a good run together.</i>

01:05.170 --> 01:08.571
<i> But she's not</i>
<i> quite the same anymore</i>

01:08.573 --> 01:11.174
<i> since the cancer spread.</i>

01:22.287 --> 01:24.354
<i> And he can't imagine</i>
<i> his life without her.</i>

01:24.356 --> 01:28.124
<i> The last thing she wants</i>
<i> is to be a burden.</i>

01:28.126 --> 01:31.761
<i> So they come here...</i>

01:31.763 --> 01:33.262
<i> to be alone.</i>

01:33.264 --> 01:36.032
<i> So they never have</i>
<i> to be alone again.</i>

01:39.337 --> 01:42.271
<i> I...</i>

01:42.273 --> 01:45.208
<i> envy them.</i>

01:45.210 --> 01:47.176
(gunshots)

01:53.518 --> 01:57.487
Have you ever seen
anything more beautiful?

01:57.489 --> 02:00.223
All I can see is
eight hours of hard scrubbing

02:00.225 --> 02:01.991
gonna take to get

02:01.993 --> 02:03.393
the blood off
these walls.

02:03.395 --> 02:04.894
Why don't people
have the courtesy

02:04.896 --> 02:07.296
to blow their brains out
at their own home?

02:07.298 --> 02:10.333
What if one of the kids
found them like this?

02:10.335 --> 02:13.136
Well, I don't see why
that has to be my problem.

02:13.138 --> 02:15.972
LIZ:
Look at them.

02:21.379 --> 02:22.745
(crying)

02:22.747 --> 02:25.548
Why are you crying?

02:25.550 --> 02:28.084
They were happy.

02:28.086 --> 02:32.155
I feel like
I'll never be happy again.

02:32.157 --> 02:35.191
I pretend that I'm okay living
in a world without Tristan,

02:35.193 --> 02:37.560
but it's...

02:37.562 --> 02:40.363
it's been difficult.

02:40.365 --> 02:43.833
Besides,

02:43.835 --> 02:47.170
knowing The Countess,
it's just a matter of time

02:47.172 --> 02:50.540
before she slits my throat.

02:50.542 --> 02:54.410
What's the point of waiting
around for someone to...

02:54.412 --> 02:58.347
stab you in the back
when I'm already dead?

02:58.349 --> 03:00.349
No, no, no, no, no.
Wait.

03:00.351 --> 03:02.285
Just let me do it.
No, no.

03:02.287 --> 03:04.287
I don't want
to be here.
I know.

03:04.289 --> 03:06.255
Well, you're gonna be stuck
here for all of eternity

03:06.257 --> 03:09.225
unless you get your head
strapped on straight

03:09.227 --> 03:10.426
before pulling that trigger.

03:12.797 --> 03:16.199
Oh, shit.

03:16.201 --> 03:18.234
Jesus.

03:18.236 --> 03:20.269
You know how this goes.

03:20.271 --> 03:22.071
(sighs)

03:22.073 --> 03:23.306
Yeah.

03:23.308 --> 03:24.440
And I'm guessing

03:24.442 --> 03:26.209
you have plenty
of unfinished business

03:26.211 --> 03:27.243
still on your plate.

03:27.245 --> 03:28.444
No, just one.

03:28.446 --> 03:30.246
My son.

03:30.248 --> 03:32.281
I always meant
to put that right.

03:32.283 --> 03:35.251
Tell him I'm sorry
for leaving him.

03:35.253 --> 03:36.385
Okay.

03:36.387 --> 03:39.789
So you do that.

03:39.791 --> 03:42.592
And that'll give me
enough time to cancel

03:42.594 --> 03:44.260
my<i> Reader's Digest,</i>

03:44.262 --> 03:47.463
my<i> Country Living.</i>

03:49.167 --> 03:51.300
Then we'll be ready to go.

03:51.302 --> 03:53.336
"We"?

03:53.338 --> 03:56.072
You don't have
to do this alone.

03:56.074 --> 03:57.406
I don't understand.

03:57.408 --> 03:59.408
I thought you were reborn.

03:59.410 --> 04:03.312
Donovan was
my one true love.

04:03.314 --> 04:06.149
I thought when he brought me
back from the brink of death,

04:06.151 --> 04:09.252
it was because he loved me.

04:09.254 --> 04:13.122
He doesn't love me.

04:13.124 --> 04:15.424
He never will.

04:17.295 --> 04:20.329
We'll do it together then.

04:20.331 --> 04:24.167
Make a clean exit.

04:24.169 --> 04:27.737
¶ ¶

04:56.868 --> 05:00.303
¶ ¶

05:33.905 --> 05:36.005
MS. EVERS:
Yes, dear, the Hotel Cortez

05:36.007 --> 05:38.007
in downtown Los Angeles.

05:38.009 --> 05:41.244
And you have the dates now.

05:41.246 --> 05:42.378
That's right, dear.

05:42.380 --> 05:45.381
One whole week--
your papa's treat.

05:45.383 --> 05:47.984
What's that, um...?

05:49.621 --> 05:52.288
He wants to know,
"Why now?"

05:55.560 --> 05:57.960
Well, I'd hoped to reach
your father to ask,

05:57.962 --> 05:59.629
but alas, I cannot.

05:59.631 --> 06:01.864
I-I must away.
Bye now.

06:01.866 --> 06:03.366
(hangs phone up)

06:03.368 --> 06:05.401
Really...

06:05.403 --> 06:06.969
I can't thank you enough.

06:06.971 --> 06:09.572
If you don't
mind my asking,

06:09.574 --> 06:11.307
how long has it been?

06:15.280 --> 06:18.547
I haven't seen
my son in 31 years.

06:20.485 --> 06:21.784
I've written letters.

06:21.786 --> 06:24.086
God knows I've written checks.

06:24.088 --> 06:28.224
The bank statement always let
me know that each one cleared.

06:28.226 --> 06:31.327
I took that as...

06:31.329 --> 06:33.095
a sign.

06:33.097 --> 06:34.964
I must
caution you.

06:34.966 --> 06:38.100
You don't know exactly
the young man's aspect.

06:38.102 --> 06:39.468
I don't follow you.

06:39.470 --> 06:41.470
His worldview.

06:41.472 --> 06:45.408
I-I fear you are challenging
him to be very understanding.

06:45.410 --> 06:47.410
Let me stop you right there.

06:47.412 --> 06:49.645
Back in my day, fairies knew

06:49.647 --> 06:51.647
never to father children.

06:51.649 --> 06:54.250
It would, it would only
add to the mayhem.

06:54.252 --> 06:57.687
My cousin Frederick.

06:57.689 --> 06:59.422
He was always getting
into his sister's

06:59.424 --> 07:02.858
peignoir and stockings.

07:05.496 --> 07:08.431
And-and then one day,
he found his place.

07:08.433 --> 07:10.433
His station in life.

07:10.435 --> 07:13.703
Took his comfort
in the sacramental vestments.

07:13.705 --> 07:16.439
He might've become a monsignor,

07:16.441 --> 07:19.508
had he not succumbed
to his appetites.

07:19.510 --> 07:22.144
I'm not a pedophile!

07:22.146 --> 07:23.479
I lost interest long ago

07:23.481 --> 07:25.348
in whatever
you claim to be.

07:25.350 --> 07:27.850
No, all I know is some poor boy

07:27.852 --> 07:29.719
threw a ball in the backyard,

07:29.721 --> 07:31.487
and suddenly

07:31.489 --> 07:35.224
his proud papa wasn't
there to catch it.

07:35.226 --> 07:39.028
So now here comes
this same little boy

07:39.030 --> 07:42.631
to visit someone he's
always longed to see.

07:42.633 --> 07:45.534
And instead he's
going to be confronted

07:45.536 --> 07:47.470
by the ghost of Theda Bara.

07:47.472 --> 07:48.971
I mean, it's-it's
quite a fright indeed.

07:48.973 --> 07:51.040
That's enough!

07:55.480 --> 07:57.046
Anyhoo.

07:57.048 --> 07:59.682
Where's that item
you promised me?

07:59.684 --> 08:01.784
You haven't forgotten
your end of the bargain.

08:07.692 --> 08:09.892
Have at it.

08:09.894 --> 08:12.762
(chuckling)
Go nuts.

08:12.764 --> 08:15.531
Oh, who would have thought?

08:15.533 --> 08:17.933
Oxygen in the soap!

08:17.935 --> 08:19.568
Yes.
For God's sake, look.

08:19.570 --> 08:21.537
"Radiant whites," it says.

08:21.539 --> 08:23.372
You are an absolute marvel.

08:23.374 --> 08:25.641
It's like Christmas morning.

08:40.758 --> 08:43.759
Ears.

08:43.761 --> 08:47.196
For they heard
the calling of false gods.

08:47.198 --> 08:51.667
You're a clever man,
John Lowe.

08:52.637 --> 08:54.804
MAN:
Empty your hearts.

08:54.806 --> 08:57.706
Let the Lady of Shadows
hear your prayers.

09:00.812 --> 09:03.412
Welcome to our church.

09:03.414 --> 09:05.714
Is this your first time here?

09:05.716 --> 09:09.585
Know that the old
gods are not dead.

09:09.587 --> 09:12.488
They're waiting
to be awakened.

09:12.490 --> 09:14.390
What is your name?

09:16.060 --> 09:18.427
I am...

09:18.429 --> 09:19.528
death.

09:20.665 --> 09:21.831
(screams)
(men grunting)

09:25.570 --> 09:27.403
(woman screaming)

09:34.679 --> 09:35.945
No!

09:35.947 --> 09:39.081
One more
and you'll be free.

09:44.589 --> 09:48.157
("Lucretia My Reflection"
by Sisters of Mercy playing)

09:58.769 --> 10:00.603
What is the meaning of this?

10:00.605 --> 10:02.505
¶ I hear the roar
of a big machine... ¶

10:02.507 --> 10:04.039
Welcome.

10:04.041 --> 10:06.509
Thank you for coming.

10:06.511 --> 10:10.045
¶ Two worlds and in between... ¶

10:10.047 --> 10:12.281
What do you want?

10:12.283 --> 10:14.183
Who are you?

10:14.185 --> 10:15.651
¶ Hot metal and methedrine... ¶

10:15.653 --> 10:17.720
Who am I?

10:17.722 --> 10:20.055
¶ I hear empire down... ¶

10:20.057 --> 10:21.790
I'm you, asshole.

10:21.792 --> 10:23.459
COUNTESS:
<i> We need to have a little talk.</i>

10:23.461 --> 10:25.694
I didn't really think
that you brought me here

10:25.696 --> 10:27.730
to rummage through
your old clothes.

10:27.732 --> 10:30.900
And I'm not interested
in your castoffs anyway.

10:30.902 --> 10:34.503
Though I know you're
very interested in mine.

10:34.505 --> 10:38.040
VALENTINO:
<i> So, you know</i>
<i> my entire biography?</i>

10:38.042 --> 10:40.309
Damned behind
a wall for decades.

10:40.311 --> 10:42.511
And now ready to
be damned again.

10:42.513 --> 10:44.213
I love her!

10:44.215 --> 10:46.415
You think you love him?

10:46.417 --> 10:48.517
You love a distant memory.

10:48.519 --> 10:50.686
You love an image on a screen.

10:50.688 --> 10:53.722
You're nothing more
than a fan to him.

10:53.724 --> 10:55.491
¶ Dum-dum bullets... ¶

10:55.493 --> 10:58.260
You know, your petulance
is very common.

10:58.262 --> 11:01.497
It is always this way
with pretty boys

11:01.499 --> 11:03.532
who are past their prime.

11:03.534 --> 11:05.534
¶ Empire down... ¶

11:05.536 --> 11:08.370
You should grow out
that little beard, you know?

11:08.372 --> 11:11.574
Maybe you could find, uh,
work in the Westerns.

11:11.576 --> 11:12.608
We don't need you.

11:12.610 --> 11:13.943
You know nothing

11:13.945 --> 11:16.345
of my resourcefulness,

11:16.347 --> 11:18.380
little mouse.

11:18.382 --> 11:19.682
You can go.

11:19.684 --> 11:21.116
You wouldn't last two days

11:21.118 --> 11:23.252
with The Countess
in the real world.

11:23.254 --> 11:24.720
Once she sees
how you shit yourself

11:24.722 --> 11:26.722
at the sound
of a traffic helicopter.

11:26.724 --> 11:29.191
Oh, I know all about you.

11:29.193 --> 11:31.927
I am the greatest
screen lover of all time.

11:31.929 --> 11:33.529
You're cheap.

11:33.531 --> 11:35.431
You've always been cheap.

11:36.734 --> 11:38.901
(laughs)

11:38.903 --> 11:40.836
You have a freaking sword.

11:42.306 --> 11:44.707
I should've killed you
after our first tango.

11:44.709 --> 11:47.209
You should be honored
to die by its blade.

11:47.211 --> 11:48.711
Bitch, please.

11:51.616 --> 11:53.949
Really?

11:56.487 --> 11:59.822
Who's the little mouse now?

11:59.824 --> 12:03.092
She's gonna mourn over
that pretty face.

12:03.094 --> 12:06.562
¶ We look hard ¶

12:06.564 --> 12:09.798
¶ To see for real ¶

12:09.800 --> 12:12.735
¶ Such things I hear... ¶

12:12.737 --> 12:15.838
You're not so pretty now,
are you?

12:15.840 --> 12:18.907
¶ I don't see much evidence ¶

12:18.909 --> 12:21.210
¶ I don't feel ¶

12:22.647 --> 12:25.848
¶ I don't feel... ¶

12:25.850 --> 12:29.318
I have better cheekbones,
anyway.

12:29.320 --> 12:31.720
Cheekbones for days.

12:42.033 --> 12:44.166
Help! Help!

12:44.168 --> 12:46.635
Can anybody hear me?! Help!

12:46.637 --> 12:48.971
MARCH:
You can scream
as loud as you like.

12:48.973 --> 12:51.674
In fact, I prefer it.

12:51.676 --> 12:53.776
What do you want from me?

12:53.778 --> 12:54.910
No.

12:56.147 --> 12:57.046
No.
Oh, now...

12:58.015 --> 12:59.448
Help me.
You failed.

12:59.450 --> 13:00.949
I'm a contractor.

13:00.951 --> 13:02.785
I make optimistic projections.

13:02.787 --> 13:04.286
Please, I'll do anything.

13:04.288 --> 13:05.621
I'll make this up to you.

13:05.623 --> 13:06.722
Please, don't do this.

13:06.724 --> 13:08.724
I'll do anything
you want, please.

13:08.726 --> 13:10.059
Please don't.

13:10.061 --> 13:13.562
A man is only
as good as his word.

13:13.564 --> 13:15.164
(screams)

13:15.166 --> 13:17.232
(screaming)

13:25.209 --> 13:27.910
What are you doing?

13:27.912 --> 13:29.912
Keeping up the practice.

13:29.914 --> 13:33.882
I have great plans
for us, you and me.

13:37.855 --> 13:38.887
Ever since my death,

13:38.889 --> 13:40.489
my hunting grounds
have been limited

13:40.491 --> 13:42.691
to the confines of this hotel.

13:42.693 --> 13:44.660
And as rich as it may be,

13:44.662 --> 13:45.994
there are opportunities
available to you

13:45.996 --> 13:47.563
that I can only dream of.

13:51.602 --> 13:53.068
Where's my wife?

13:53.070 --> 13:54.737
Forget her.

13:54.739 --> 13:56.605
I find spouses
to be a distraction.

13:56.607 --> 13:58.907
I suspect my own to have
ended my career prematurely

13:58.909 --> 14:00.909
by turning me in
to the police.

14:00.911 --> 14:02.444
I've forgiven her,
of course,

14:02.446 --> 14:03.879
because of her
immense beauty.

14:03.881 --> 14:05.848
I need to find Alex.

14:05.850 --> 14:07.149
You know where she is.

14:08.552 --> 14:09.952
Of course.

14:09.954 --> 14:11.286
I know everything.

14:11.288 --> 14:13.355
I have nothing but time
and imagination.

14:13.357 --> 14:15.524
But what I have planned for us,
beyond the Ten Commandments,

14:15.526 --> 14:17.526
will elevate you to the
zenith of our profession.

14:17.528 --> 14:20.095
You take the glory, John.

14:20.097 --> 14:21.897
I'll stand humbly
in your shadow.

14:21.899 --> 14:23.966
You tell me where she is

14:23.968 --> 14:25.200
or your dreams are just that.

14:26.804 --> 14:29.571
Precocious.

14:29.573 --> 14:32.741
I'd expect nothing less
from my star pupil.

14:32.743 --> 14:34.777
Come!

14:34.779 --> 14:36.645
Your reunion awaits.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.751
MS. EVERS:
There's nothing like
the steam from a fresh pot

14:42.753 --> 14:45.020
to loosen the phlegm
from the lungs.

14:46.957 --> 14:48.123
Thank you.

14:52.763 --> 14:55.764
You mustn't have an argument
on an empty stomach.

14:55.766 --> 14:58.867
It upsets
the balance of the day.

15:03.808 --> 15:05.340
I'm sure you didn't wake me up

15:05.342 --> 15:07.009
to have a cup of coffee.

15:07.011 --> 15:08.143
You told me Holden was

15:08.145 --> 15:09.978
a hallucination.
That was a lie.

15:09.980 --> 15:11.947
You tried to make me think
I was going crazy.

15:11.949 --> 15:13.949
Well, that was the truth.

15:13.951 --> 15:16.852
You kept my son away from me.

15:16.854 --> 15:18.187
In case you haven't noticed,

15:18.189 --> 15:20.055
he's not the child you knew.

15:22.326 --> 15:25.194
I made my choice
to be with Holden.

15:25.196 --> 15:26.995
I didn't tell you

15:26.997 --> 15:30.065
because I was afraid you would
say something to change my mind.

15:31.969 --> 15:34.636
I don't regret my decision.

15:34.638 --> 15:36.972
We have another child.

15:36.974 --> 15:39.575
I haven't forgotten
about Scarlett.

15:47.351 --> 15:50.719
All this time,

15:50.721 --> 15:53.856
you've seen her twice.

15:53.858 --> 15:56.959
She told me.

15:56.961 --> 16:00.062
And how many times have
you been to visit Grandma?

16:00.064 --> 16:02.965
No excuses.

16:02.967 --> 16:04.466
We abandoned her.

16:04.468 --> 16:06.401
We're the world's worst parents.

16:06.403 --> 16:09.438
Well, at least that's one thing
we can agree on.

16:12.409 --> 16:15.644
Maybe it'll be better
for Scarlett with me gone.

16:16.747 --> 16:19.114
What's that supposed to mean?

16:21.685 --> 16:23.986
We're in trouble.

16:23.988 --> 16:26.154
I made a mistake
a while ago,

16:26.156 --> 16:28.991
and The Countess
holds me responsible.

16:28.993 --> 16:31.093
Tell me.

16:33.264 --> 16:35.764
COUNTESS:
<i> A pack of wild children</i>

16:35.766 --> 16:38.433
<i>drained a man of all his blood.</i>

16:38.435 --> 16:40.769
Anything you want
to tell me, Alex?

16:40.771 --> 16:43.605
ALEX:
<i> I saved my patient.</i>
<i> Max was dying from measles.</i>

16:43.607 --> 16:46.575
<i> So you turned him...</i>
<i> and he turned the others.</i>

16:46.577 --> 16:48.911
One chance to fix this problem.

16:48.913 --> 16:51.013
Countess told me
she'd kill me and Holden

16:51.015 --> 16:52.948
if I didn't make
things right.

16:52.950 --> 16:56.451
I know it's not your problem...

16:56.453 --> 16:58.053
If it involves you and Holden,

16:58.055 --> 17:00.789
it's my problem.

17:00.791 --> 17:02.858
What do we
have to do?

17:06.630 --> 17:08.130
MS. EVERS:
Tap.

17:08.132 --> 17:09.464
Tap-tap-tap.

17:09.466 --> 17:11.099
Tap-tap-tap.

17:11.101 --> 17:13.902
That's Morse Code
for "he's coming up the stairs."

17:13.904 --> 17:17.039
Clutch your
pearls, Daddy.

17:17.041 --> 17:19.107
(exhales)

17:19.109 --> 17:21.543
Good God.

17:21.545 --> 17:23.312
I didn't think
I'd be so nervous.

17:23.314 --> 17:26.048
Your son is all settled
in his room.

17:26.050 --> 17:28.717
He knows about the
complimentary drink tickets,

17:28.719 --> 17:31.486
and here he comes
to redeem them.

17:31.488 --> 17:33.188
(exhales)

17:37.761 --> 17:39.094
Okay.

17:39.096 --> 17:40.162
Bye now.
(giggles)

17:42.333 --> 17:45.167
Good afternoon.

17:45.169 --> 17:47.903
It's happy hour,

17:47.905 --> 17:49.338
so...

17:49.340 --> 17:51.974
feel free to smile.

17:51.976 --> 17:53.241
(chuckles)

17:53.243 --> 17:55.010
Maybe...

17:55.012 --> 17:57.245
something to drink?

17:57.247 --> 17:58.513
Sure.

17:58.515 --> 17:59.848
How about a bourbon rocks?

17:59.850 --> 18:01.416
And a soda back, please.

18:02.119 --> 18:03.418
I'm Douglas.

18:06.023 --> 18:07.723
Call me Liz.

18:09.259 --> 18:11.460
What's your, uh...

18:11.462 --> 18:13.161
what's your line of work?

18:13.163 --> 18:15.797
Uh, I work for
a guy who owns

18:15.799 --> 18:18.667
huge properties packed
with self-storage units

18:18.669 --> 18:20.135
in and around Denver.

18:20.137 --> 18:21.603
Oh.

18:21.605 --> 18:24.039
Company makes
some serious coin...

18:24.041 --> 18:26.274
Oh.
...not that I do.

18:28.779 --> 18:30.045
Hey, I like your dress,

18:30.047 --> 18:31.780
by the way.

18:31.782 --> 18:33.782
Sparkly!

18:33.784 --> 18:35.484
What do you call those?

18:35.486 --> 18:36.785
What?

18:36.787 --> 18:39.955
Uh, the... those round things.

18:39.957 --> 18:42.124
The... oh.

18:42.126 --> 18:43.392
Paillettes.

18:43.394 --> 18:45.961
(both laugh)

18:48.165 --> 18:50.899
DOUGLAS:
And then...
then my wife insisted

18:50.901 --> 18:52.901
that I needed to
find a new boss.

18:52.903 --> 18:54.403
Or to... better yet, she said,

18:54.405 --> 18:56.905
to be my own.

18:56.907 --> 18:58.206
I mean...

18:58.208 --> 19:01.143
Oh, give her a break.

19:01.145 --> 19:03.812
Your bride
sounds astute.

19:03.814 --> 19:05.080
Yeah.

19:05.082 --> 19:06.381
Yeah, she is.

19:06.383 --> 19:08.183
(chuckles)

19:08.185 --> 19:10.652
But that doesn't make
the mortgage payment

19:10.654 --> 19:12.654
any less late.

19:12.656 --> 19:15.991
We all have dreams, you know?

19:15.993 --> 19:18.727
Not meant to drop everything...

19:18.729 --> 19:20.562
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

19:20.564 --> 19:21.863
I disagree.

19:21.865 --> 19:24.032
You go ahead.

19:24.034 --> 19:27.102
You move to Boulder and
you start that kayak company.

19:27.104 --> 19:31.106
Anyway, I'm sorry
to bend your ear.

19:31.108 --> 19:34.242
I've always kept my own counsel,
you know?

19:34.244 --> 19:36.578
Coming up, it was, uh...

19:36.580 --> 19:38.113
just my mom and I.

19:38.115 --> 19:41.183
Dad split.

19:41.185 --> 19:44.119
Missed my one great season
in Pee Wee League.

19:44.121 --> 19:45.487
(chuckles)

19:47.591 --> 19:49.357
I can't blame the guy.

19:49.359 --> 19:52.094
I was a rambunctious kid.

19:52.096 --> 19:55.564
Oh...

19:55.566 --> 19:57.866
you shouldn't blame yourself.

19:57.868 --> 19:59.868
I'm sure your father
had his reasons.

19:59.870 --> 20:01.369
Well, those'll be news to me,

20:01.371 --> 20:03.438
whenever I hear 'em.

20:05.309 --> 20:07.375
I guess he's on my mind.

20:08.612 --> 20:10.479
I'm in town 'cause we're...

20:10.481 --> 20:13.081
finally gonna reconnect.

20:13.083 --> 20:15.784
Well...

20:15.786 --> 20:17.285
here's to that.

20:17.287 --> 20:18.687
Yeah.

20:23.894 --> 20:25.727
This, uh, next one's on me.

20:28.632 --> 20:30.732
Nice of you.

20:30.734 --> 20:32.934
Maybe another time.

20:32.936 --> 20:34.302
I'd like that.

20:43.180 --> 20:44.913
ALEX:
We're too late.

20:44.915 --> 20:46.181
The police must have
tracked down

20:46.183 --> 20:48.250
the delivery boy.

20:48.252 --> 20:49.818
Kids must be
long gone.

20:52.189 --> 20:54.256
Maybe not.

20:54.258 --> 20:56.024
Somebody's inside.

20:56.026 --> 20:58.693
(door creaks)

21:21.318 --> 21:22.651
(rustling sound)

21:22.653 --> 21:24.019
Hey.

21:25.389 --> 21:26.955
Stay here.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.807
(coughing)

22:02.192 --> 22:03.825
(coughing continues)

22:06.230 --> 22:07.395
Hey there.

22:09.499 --> 22:10.932
What's your name?

22:10.934 --> 22:13.168
Kimmy.

22:13.170 --> 22:15.437
I want my mommy.

22:15.439 --> 22:17.539
Okay, Kimmy.

22:17.541 --> 22:19.174
Let's see what's
going on with you.

22:19.176 --> 22:20.775
Get away from her!

22:20.777 --> 22:22.544
(screams)

22:22.546 --> 22:24.646
(grunting)

22:26.383 --> 22:28.183
(gunshot)

22:28.185 --> 22:29.517
Don't move!

22:31.622 --> 22:32.954
You're bleeding.

22:32.956 --> 22:34.289
I'm okay.

22:34.291 --> 22:35.423
Yo!

22:35.425 --> 22:36.958
Don't make me have to shoot you.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.128
You don't scare me.

22:40.130 --> 22:42.931
There's a lot more
of us than you.

22:54.244 --> 22:56.044
We told you not to come back.

22:56.046 --> 22:58.213
(coughing)
Kimmy!

22:58.215 --> 23:00.048
Please.

23:00.050 --> 23:01.583
Please, you have to help her!

23:01.585 --> 23:04.319
Maddie! Get back.

23:04.321 --> 23:06.554
You ready? Breathe for me.
Ready?

23:07.824 --> 23:09.958
Come on, honey.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.060
MADDIE (sobbing):
Come on, Kimmy.

23:12.062 --> 23:13.061
Fix her!
ALEX:
I can't stop.

23:13.063 --> 23:14.462
(Maddie sobbing)

23:14.464 --> 23:16.965
Kimmy, come on.

23:19.469 --> 23:20.635
ALEX:
Come here.

23:25.509 --> 23:27.342
Come on.

23:27.344 --> 23:29.878
(sobbing)

23:32.249 --> 23:34.149
Why did you stop?

23:35.819 --> 23:37.252
Help her!

23:37.254 --> 23:39.254
It's too late for Kimmy.

23:39.256 --> 23:41.323
MADDIE (crying):
Come on.

23:43.527 --> 23:45.527
It doesn't have to be too late
for the rest of you.

24:00.444 --> 24:02.477
DETECTIVE:
<i> How long has your husband</i>
<i> been missing, Mrs. Drake?</i>

24:02.479 --> 24:03.878
Since Wednesday evening.

24:03.880 --> 24:07.382
Virtually the last thing
he said to me was, "I do."

24:07.384 --> 24:09.451
Then I came up here to change

24:09.453 --> 24:11.553
and finish packing.

24:11.555 --> 24:15.357
He was going to the bar
for a drink.

24:15.359 --> 24:18.560
That's the last
I heard from him.

24:18.562 --> 24:20.862
I wouldn't panic yet,
Mrs. Drake.

24:20.864 --> 24:23.865
Some grooms, um,
they get cold feet

24:23.867 --> 24:26.368
after the ceremony
instead of before.

24:26.370 --> 24:29.170
Oh, you don't know my husband.

24:29.172 --> 24:32.173
He's a very responsible
human being.

24:32.175 --> 24:35.477
He would never abandon
his new bride

24:35.479 --> 24:37.545
or his young son this way.

24:37.547 --> 24:39.414
Something must have happened.

24:40.550 --> 24:43.585
Darling, I wasn't aware
we had visitors.

24:43.587 --> 24:45.553
I'm Will Drake.

24:45.555 --> 24:48.356
Dearest.

24:48.358 --> 24:51.760
Sir, your wife was under the
impression you'd gone missing.

24:51.762 --> 24:53.328
"Missing"?

24:53.330 --> 24:55.096
(chuckling):
No.

24:55.098 --> 24:57.599
No, I was just exploring the new
renovation on the seventh floor

24:57.601 --> 25:00.402
and got lost in the
hallways for two days.

25:00.404 --> 25:02.404
I'd love to
show it to you.

25:02.406 --> 25:04.706
My wife designed it herself.
Oh, we couldn't possibly waste

25:04.708 --> 25:06.708
You really should see
what's in there.
these officers' time any longer.

25:06.710 --> 25:08.710
I am so sorry...

25:08.712 --> 25:11.713
for how I've inconvenienced you.

25:11.715 --> 25:13.715
(chuckling):
I was... confused.

25:13.717 --> 25:15.517
Yeah.

25:15.519 --> 25:18.520
DETECTIVE:
Well, we're just glad
everything turned out okay.

25:18.522 --> 25:21.556
COUNTESS:
A happy ending
without all the tugging

25:21.558 --> 25:23.224
and the pushing and...

25:23.226 --> 25:24.526
Thank you.
Thank you again.

25:24.528 --> 25:26.628
(door closes)

25:28.565 --> 25:30.799
You murdered me, you bitch.

25:30.801 --> 25:32.367
Oh, get over it.

25:32.369 --> 25:34.135
You pissed me off.

25:34.137 --> 25:37.138
You made disparaging remarks
about Bartholomew.

25:37.140 --> 25:38.940
That I cannot abide.

25:38.942 --> 25:40.742
Bullshit.

25:40.744 --> 25:42.811
This was your
plan all along.

25:44.548 --> 25:46.581
So what happens now?

25:46.583 --> 25:49.250
My body turns up
in some filthy alleyway?

25:49.252 --> 25:50.919
You take control of my empire?

25:50.921 --> 25:54.689
I thought I'd dissolve
the empire, convert it to cash.

25:56.993 --> 25:58.560
Well, you forget.

25:58.562 --> 26:00.395
You're not in the will.

26:02.632 --> 26:05.633
No, you forget.

26:05.635 --> 26:07.702
Lachlan inherits everything.

26:17.681 --> 26:20.982
And you made me his legally
appointed guardian.

26:20.984 --> 26:23.985
I'll be guiding him.

26:23.987 --> 26:26.154
Only until he reaches
his majority.

26:26.156 --> 26:28.723
Assuming he ever does.

26:33.663 --> 26:35.663
Are you threatening
my son?

26:35.665 --> 26:38.733
I don't kill children, but I
could make him a blood relative.

26:41.204 --> 26:43.771
You mean like that woman who
sucked me dry in the hallway.

26:45.709 --> 26:48.510
You're a lot smarter dead
than you ever were alive.

26:48.512 --> 26:50.578
Try and keep it
that way.

26:52.516 --> 26:53.815
(grunts)

26:53.817 --> 26:55.617
Why don't you go
visit our son?

26:55.619 --> 26:58.119
We wouldn't want
anything to upset him.

26:58.121 --> 27:02.123
Tell him we decided not
to honeymoon in Paris after all.

27:02.125 --> 27:06.895
I advised you not to kill
him on the premises.

27:06.897 --> 27:08.963
Bite me.

27:14.070 --> 27:16.137
¶ ¶

27:38.528 --> 27:40.595
(elevator bell dings)

27:45.735 --> 27:47.769
ALEX:
There's a room
at the end of the hall.

27:47.771 --> 27:49.571
It's ready for you.

27:49.573 --> 27:51.573
I'm gonna try and find you
something or someone to eat.

27:51.575 --> 27:53.675
You must be starving.

27:53.677 --> 27:56.177
We can wait out here
till you get back.

27:56.179 --> 27:57.312
I'll just be a sec.

28:04.688 --> 28:05.920
Okay.

28:05.922 --> 28:07.255
Come on.

28:26.810 --> 28:28.109
Go on in.

28:28.111 --> 28:29.777
Your friends are
waiting for you.

28:31.715 --> 28:33.815
I don't want to.

28:33.817 --> 28:35.216
JOHN:
Let's go.

28:37.320 --> 28:38.820
No!
No!
No!

28:38.822 --> 28:41.823
(pounding on door)
No!

28:41.825 --> 28:45.093
Help! Open up! Open it!

28:45.095 --> 28:47.161
(pounding on door)

28:49.633 --> 28:52.000
Let us out!
Open up!

28:53.803 --> 28:54.869
Max!

28:56.406 --> 28:58.673
I told you, we should have
never trusted that bitch!

28:58.675 --> 29:00.675
Shut up!

29:02.178 --> 29:04.245
(grunting)

29:15.425 --> 29:17.492
(Ramona grunts)

29:28.338 --> 29:31.139
(chuckles)

29:31.141 --> 29:36.010
Mama... smells appetizers.

29:47.157 --> 29:49.157
ALEX:
Why do I feel like a teenager

29:49.159 --> 29:50.992
that's about to get caught?
(John chuckles)

29:50.994 --> 29:52.694
We're getting a divorce.

29:52.696 --> 29:53.795
We're not supposed to
be sleeping together.

29:53.797 --> 29:55.863
Who says we have
to go through with it?

29:57.867 --> 30:00.168
I do.

30:00.170 --> 30:04.672
Has anything really changed
since I gave you the papers?

30:04.674 --> 30:06.674
Everything.

30:06.676 --> 30:08.209
You found Holden.

30:08.211 --> 30:10.278
You are different,
aren't you?

30:12.315 --> 30:14.716
Something solid
behind your eyes.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.454
You're all there.

30:21.925 --> 30:23.991
Finally got it
together, John.

30:33.870 --> 30:37.672
I can't.

30:37.674 --> 30:40.441
I have to process this.

30:40.443 --> 30:43.511
And I have to check on
Holden and the kids.

30:47.450 --> 30:50.518
I am interested
in this new John, though.

30:58.294 --> 30:59.927
(door closes)

31:03.133 --> 31:05.133
SALLY:
Did you come inside her,

31:05.135 --> 31:07.769
or did you shoot on her tits
like you do with me?

31:11.941 --> 31:13.474
Sally.

31:13.476 --> 31:16.043
With the whore,
it's always on the tits.

31:18.982 --> 31:21.783
That's what
I am to you.

31:21.785 --> 31:24.585
A whore.

31:24.587 --> 31:26.387
You're wrong.

31:26.389 --> 31:28.389
It's not like that.

31:28.391 --> 31:30.158
I told you what
you meant to me.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.160
Yeah.

31:32.162 --> 31:35.730
You told me you loved me.

31:35.732 --> 31:37.799
And don't you dare deny it.

31:37.801 --> 31:39.600
I'm not a liar.

31:39.602 --> 31:41.602
I have loved you.

31:41.604 --> 31:45.907
But what we have is
an addict's high.

31:45.909 --> 31:50.411
In the moment, it seems
like it's never ending.

31:50.413 --> 31:52.113
But it always ends.

31:52.115 --> 31:55.616
Oh, no.

31:55.618 --> 31:58.419
Oh, no, baby.

31:58.421 --> 32:01.989
There will never be
anyone like me.

32:01.991 --> 32:04.992
John...

32:04.994 --> 32:08.095
you can't tell me that
this isn't what you want.

32:31.187 --> 32:33.120
No.

32:33.122 --> 32:34.922
Come on.
No.

32:40.897 --> 32:42.964
Alex is not
the answer.

32:44.801 --> 32:47.235
She doesn't know about you.

32:47.237 --> 32:49.303
Not the way I do.

32:52.876 --> 32:55.943
How's she gonna take it
when she finds out the truth?

32:58.348 --> 33:01.849
That you're a serial killer.

33:01.851 --> 33:04.218
You think she'll
take you back?

33:06.022 --> 33:08.322
Accept you
the way I do?

33:20.837 --> 33:22.837
No, I have to try.

33:22.839 --> 33:25.072
For Scarlett
and for Holden.

33:25.074 --> 33:27.642
Bullshit.

33:30.079 --> 33:34.081
This is for you.

33:34.083 --> 33:36.150
It's for you.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.120
You're right.

33:39.122 --> 33:41.188
If I'm being honest
with myself.

33:49.432 --> 33:52.233
She left you.

33:52.235 --> 33:54.735
She lied to you.

33:54.737 --> 33:58.039
She wanted you out of her life.

33:58.041 --> 34:01.142
I was there for five years.

34:20.163 --> 34:22.229
I'm sorry.

34:25.268 --> 34:27.835
I deserve more than this!

34:32.175 --> 34:34.575
(both grunting)

34:40.149 --> 34:42.149
(elevator bell dings)

34:42.151 --> 34:44.151
Stay away from me.

34:44.153 --> 34:46.454
You'll be back, asshole!

34:46.456 --> 34:48.956
She'll leave you
once she learns what you are.

34:48.958 --> 34:51.826
She'll leave you,
or maybe I'll kill that bitch!

34:57.367 --> 34:59.367
Oh, it's the most
beautiful thing

34:59.369 --> 35:01.936
I have ever laid eyes on.

35:01.938 --> 35:04.872
Oh, thank you, thank you.

35:04.874 --> 35:07.975
Oh, oh, how-how...
how do I use it again?

35:07.977 --> 35:09.777
(sighs)

35:09.779 --> 35:13.781
Uh, okay, you press
this once for cold.

35:13.783 --> 35:14.782
(chuckles)

35:14.784 --> 35:16.550
And twice for hot.

35:16.552 --> 35:19.120
And there's even a separate
setting for delicates.

35:19.122 --> 35:21.122
(shudders)

35:21.124 --> 35:22.490
Oh, and no more wringing.

35:22.492 --> 35:23.991
No more wringing.

35:23.993 --> 35:25.726
Oh, heavenly day.

35:25.728 --> 35:29.230
Thank you for helping me
reconnect with my son

35:29.232 --> 35:31.866
and for giving him
such excellent turndown service.

35:32.835 --> 35:34.835
So... good to go?

35:34.837 --> 35:36.837
Oh, yeah,
I think so.

35:36.839 --> 35:40.141
Um, have we settled
on a method?

35:40.143 --> 35:43.144
Pills? Gun? Knife?

35:43.146 --> 35:46.147
Oh, Queen of the Nile,
I must tell you.

35:46.149 --> 35:49.383
Your son has been perched in the
Blue Parrot for quite a while.

35:49.385 --> 35:51.919
Would you like me to tell him
that you will not be back?

35:51.921 --> 35:54.722
Because you're doing
yourself in?
Shit.

35:54.724 --> 35:56.190
Mainly wanted a moment
of your time.

35:56.192 --> 35:58.192
Okay.

35:58.194 --> 35:59.994
Really?

35:59.996 --> 36:01.729
I just wanted
to tell you something.

36:04.033 --> 36:06.267
Janice and I are
Boulder-bound. (chuckles)

36:06.269 --> 36:07.568
Well, cheers to that.

36:07.570 --> 36:10.337
Thanks for the push
in the right direction.

36:12.041 --> 36:14.608
I have something to tell you.

36:16.279 --> 36:20.681
And... it's...
rather difficult.

36:20.683 --> 36:23.617
Um...

36:25.221 --> 36:28.355
Hey... Dad.

36:28.357 --> 36:31.459
It's not difficult.

36:31.461 --> 36:36.163
Or... it doesn't have to be.

36:39.068 --> 36:41.302
Mom gave me
a few clues.

36:41.304 --> 36:44.271
I put them together.

36:44.273 --> 36:45.773
(laughs):
She warned me

36:45.775 --> 36:48.409
that I wouldn't recognize you,
but I-I did.

36:48.411 --> 36:51.045
I mean, I do.

36:53.449 --> 36:56.217
I don't recognize myself in you.

36:58.254 --> 37:02.223
How did I get so lucky
to raise a child

37:02.225 --> 37:05.226
so...

37:05.228 --> 37:07.495
compassionate?

37:07.497 --> 37:09.096
Mom raised me.

37:09.098 --> 37:10.664
You left.

37:11.901 --> 37:13.701
That hurt.

37:14.670 --> 37:16.971
And maybe that's what...

37:18.307 --> 37:22.076
...makes me see
when other people are all...

37:22.078 --> 37:24.812
messed up inside.

37:24.814 --> 37:28.082
Plus, Janice hears me, you know?

37:28.084 --> 37:31.919
Even when I don't even
know what I mean.

37:36.325 --> 37:39.293
And I told her

37:39.295 --> 37:43.030
that I was gonna
make things good tonight.

37:43.032 --> 37:46.400
And she's happy for us both.

37:47.503 --> 37:49.436
You have no problem
with the fact

37:49.438 --> 37:51.539
that your father is a woman?

37:51.541 --> 37:54.909
I really learned something
when Pedro died...

37:56.279 --> 37:57.311
...on<i> The Real World.</i>

37:57.313 --> 37:58.345
(chuckles)

37:58.347 --> 38:00.481
Sorry.

38:00.483 --> 38:03.584
And I kept learning.

38:05.555 --> 38:08.289
Plenty of time
to talk it out, Liz.

38:08.291 --> 38:11.492
But, hey,

38:11.494 --> 38:13.694
there's plenty of room

38:13.696 --> 38:16.197
for another woman in my life.

38:19.135 --> 38:21.202
(choked up):
Okay.

38:22.338 --> 38:25.406
My goodness,
I do love watching you

38:25.408 --> 38:26.974
work with a knife.

38:29.212 --> 38:31.712
I was a little surprised
to get your call.

38:31.714 --> 38:33.581
I figured you'd be in Paris,

38:33.583 --> 38:35.349
murdering your husband

38:35.351 --> 38:37.518
and dumping his body
in the Seine.

38:37.520 --> 38:39.820
I did a rather stupid thing,
I suppose.

38:39.822 --> 38:41.922
Felt great at the time,
but now I have

38:41.924 --> 38:43.524
a bit of a mess to deal with.

38:43.526 --> 38:46.827
Oh, I know just
what you mean.

38:48.331 --> 38:50.564
Before we could leave
for our honeymoon,

38:50.566 --> 38:52.333
we had a squabble.

38:52.335 --> 38:55.436
So I chucked him in
with Ramona and she ate him.

38:55.438 --> 38:57.371
Baby.
(laughs)

38:57.373 --> 38:59.373
You hate-watched
without me.

38:59.375 --> 39:01.208
Don't be mad.

39:01.210 --> 39:03.611
We can dump someone else
in there, maybe this weekend.

39:03.613 --> 39:07.248
In the meantime, I need you
to do something for me.

39:08.217 --> 39:09.550
Name it.

39:09.552 --> 39:11.552
I need you

39:11.554 --> 39:13.387
to retrieve Will's body

39:13.389 --> 39:15.189
before it gets too ripe.

39:15.191 --> 39:18.592
And I think Ramona should
go back in the iron maiden.

39:18.594 --> 39:20.294
Hmm.

39:20.296 --> 39:22.062
Sure.

39:22.064 --> 39:24.798
And while I'm cleaning up
your mess,

39:24.800 --> 39:26.567
maybe you can clean up mine.

39:26.569 --> 39:29.603
What did you mean "your mess"?

39:29.605 --> 39:32.439
Why don't you text
your boyfriend

39:32.441 --> 39:35.943
and ask him?

39:35.945 --> 39:37.311
Oh, oh, that's right.

39:37.313 --> 39:39.546
He doesn't know how to text.

39:41.450 --> 39:43.851
And you can forget
about FaceTime.

39:46.956 --> 39:49.523
(gasping)

39:53.963 --> 39:56.497
(sobbing)

40:05.841 --> 40:08.475
(crying)

40:28.497 --> 40:30.564
(elevator bell dings)

40:50.019 --> 40:52.586
It's open.

40:54.557 --> 40:56.490
(stammers)
I just need a sec.

40:56.492 --> 40:59.360
I wasn't sure what
we-we landed on,

40:59.362 --> 41:00.661
so I-I just put out a selection.

41:00.663 --> 41:02.162
Help yourself.

41:02.164 --> 41:04.298
Christ, it's like
you're an arms dealer.

41:07.336 --> 41:08.969
There.

41:08.971 --> 41:10.704
God.

41:10.706 --> 41:12.973
Ah, boy, it took a lot
longer than I thought.

41:12.975 --> 41:14.641
But it's finally done.

41:14.643 --> 41:16.043
What is?

41:16.045 --> 41:18.879
It's my tribute video.

41:18.881 --> 41:22.516
Nobody's gonna be rushing to
extol my virtues once I croak,

41:22.518 --> 41:26.487
so I decided to
immortalize myself.

41:26.489 --> 41:28.155
Tell me what you think.

41:28.157 --> 41:30.357
And be honest.

41:30.359 --> 41:32.760
("I Hope You Dance"
by Lee Ann Womack playing)

41:36.532 --> 41:40.501
¶ I hope you never lose
your sense of wonder ¶

41:40.503 --> 41:44.772
¶ You get your fill to eat ¶

41:44.774 --> 41:47.775
¶ But always keep
that hunger... ¶

41:47.777 --> 41:50.110
You put a lot
of work in this.

41:50.112 --> 41:51.712
¶ May you never take one si... ¶

41:51.714 --> 41:54.214
Yeah.

41:54.216 --> 41:56.350
I just,
I wanted it to be

41:56.352 --> 41:58.285
a beacon of hope

41:58.287 --> 42:00.587
for my three followers
on Instagram.

42:00.589 --> 42:01.722
(chuckles)

42:01.724 --> 42:04.224
Okay, I'm ready.

42:04.226 --> 42:05.592
Let's do this.

42:05.594 --> 42:07.361
You know, I'm just thinking

42:07.363 --> 42:09.963
the chimp might go better
before the rainbows.

42:09.965 --> 42:13.367
So it's over the "Never lose
your sense of wonder" lyric.

42:13.369 --> 42:17.004
You're stalling.

42:18.140 --> 42:20.641
My Douglas.

42:20.643 --> 42:23.811
He just told me
he wants me in his life.

42:28.317 --> 42:31.251
So you're out.

42:31.253 --> 42:33.220
(sniffles)

42:33.222 --> 42:35.656
What if one day he has kids?

42:35.658 --> 42:39.259
I'd be a grandmother, Iris.

42:39.261 --> 42:42.229
Yeah, well, I've lived
alone all my life.

42:42.231 --> 42:44.164
Every single person
I've ever loved

42:44.166 --> 42:45.566
has abandoned me,

42:45.568 --> 42:47.634
so why should you be
any different?

42:56.245 --> 42:57.678
Listen to me, Iris.

42:57.680 --> 42:59.480
You and I

42:59.482 --> 43:01.615
are women of a certain age.

43:01.617 --> 43:03.083
We have suffered

43:03.085 --> 43:06.687
more than our fair share.

43:06.689 --> 43:08.021
Damn it.

43:08.023 --> 43:10.023
We are the ones
who should inherit the earth.

43:13.629 --> 43:16.263
We should freaking
take over this damn hotel!

43:16.265 --> 43:17.598
Spiffy it up.

43:17.600 --> 43:19.199
Turn it into a place
with as much hope

43:19.201 --> 43:22.436
as your rainbow montage.

43:22.438 --> 43:25.472
<i>Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.</i>

43:25.474 --> 43:27.508
We're entitled
to a second chance.

43:27.510 --> 43:30.043
A glorious,

43:30.045 --> 43:34.281
blazing final act.

43:34.283 --> 43:36.116
My...

43:36.118 --> 43:38.218
friend...

43:38.220 --> 43:40.787
the best is yet to come.

43:49.231 --> 43:52.533
If we do this,
there's no going back.

44:01.043 --> 44:03.911
(blipping and beeping)

44:16.559 --> 44:17.925
Daddy.

44:17.927 --> 44:19.359
Holden.

44:19.361 --> 44:21.428
Holden!

44:21.430 --> 44:23.730
(laughter through tears)

44:27.836 --> 44:31.738
I can't tell you how long
I've waited to do this.

44:31.740 --> 44:33.540
Five years.

44:33.542 --> 44:35.809
Yeah.

44:37.713 --> 44:40.447
He's exactly
how I remembered him.

44:40.449 --> 44:43.750
And that's exactly
how he'll stay.

44:43.752 --> 44:46.019
It's time to go home.

45:05.741 --> 45:08.008
(elevator bell dings)

45:26.228 --> 45:27.894
John!

45:28.797 --> 45:30.364
Who's that?

45:31.433 --> 45:32.799
Just keep walking.

45:32.801 --> 45:34.167
I'm going to kill you!

45:34.169 --> 45:36.336
I swear on my soul

45:36.338 --> 45:37.337
I'm going to kill you!

45:37.339 --> 45:39.840
John...!

45:39.842 --> 45:42.309
(screaming):
John!

45:42.311 --> 45:44.678
(door closes)

45:44.680 --> 45:47.948
¶ You used to call me
on my cell phone ¶

45:47.950 --> 45:50.784
¶ Late night
when you need my love ¶

45:50.786 --> 45:54.655
¶ And I know
when that hotline bling ¶

45:54.657 --> 45:58.458
¶ That can only mean one thing ¶

45:58.460 --> 46:01.595
¶ I know when
that hotline bling ¶

46:01.597 --> 46:04.665
¶ That can only mean one thing ¶

46:04.667 --> 46:07.634
¶ Ever since
I left the city, you ¶

46:07.636 --> 46:11.438
¶ Got a reputation
for yourself now ¶

46:11.440 --> 46:15.042
¶ Everybody knows
and I feel left out ¶

46:15.044 --> 46:18.779
¶ Girl, you got me down,
you got me stressed out ¶

46:18.781 --> 46:20.714
¶ 'Cause ever since
I left the city, you... ¶

46:20.716 --> 46:22.482
You didn't run.

46:22.484 --> 46:24.785
¶ Started wearing less
and going out more ¶

46:24.787 --> 46:26.453
Why would I run?

46:26.455 --> 46:28.889
¶ Glasses of champagne
out on the dance floor... ¶

46:28.891 --> 46:30.490
You'd only find me.

46:30.492 --> 46:33.360
I couldn't find him.

46:33.362 --> 46:35.062
¶ You used to call me
on my cell phone ¶

46:35.064 --> 46:38.865
For almost a century.

46:38.867 --> 46:41.635
I didn't know
if he was dead

46:41.637 --> 46:44.237
or had abandoned me.

46:44.239 --> 46:46.807
Neither of which were true,

46:46.809 --> 46:48.875
because he'd
been trapped here

46:48.877 --> 46:50.977
the whole time.

46:50.979 --> 46:52.713
(music stops)

46:52.715 --> 46:55.115
He's not the only one
who's been trapped here.

46:57.519 --> 46:59.586
We all have.

47:03.992 --> 47:07.861
At least now he's free.

47:07.863 --> 47:10.330
And this time you know
he didn't abandon you.

47:10.332 --> 47:12.532
Is that what you want, Donovan?

47:12.534 --> 47:14.434
Is that why you did
this terrible thing?

47:14.436 --> 47:16.937
Because you wish to be set free?

47:16.939 --> 47:18.205
I suppose I do.

47:18.207 --> 47:21.074
I knew what
this would mean.

47:21.076 --> 47:24.878
I knew what he meant
the moment I saw him.

47:24.880 --> 47:28.715
What he was to you.

47:28.717 --> 47:30.083
What I could never be.

47:30.085 --> 47:31.418
He made me!

47:32.254 --> 47:33.887
He made me.

47:33.889 --> 47:36.857
He made me everything I am!

47:36.859 --> 47:39.426
And you made me

47:39.428 --> 47:41.561
in his image.

47:41.563 --> 47:43.563
Yes, I did.

47:43.565 --> 47:45.031
I tried to.

47:45.033 --> 47:47.367
I thought I couldn't
be without him.

47:49.438 --> 47:52.038
You were never him.

47:52.040 --> 47:55.342
You could never be him.

47:56.779 --> 47:59.112
So you destroyed him.

47:59.114 --> 48:01.715
First chance I got.

48:04.319 --> 48:06.119
(bottle cap pops)

48:06.121 --> 48:07.954
(liquid pouring)

48:07.956 --> 48:10.323
And you knew I'd come
back here to kill you.

48:10.325 --> 48:12.626
Yes.

48:22.838 --> 48:25.605
And you don't care.

48:25.607 --> 48:27.274
I do.

48:27.276 --> 48:29.843
I do care.

48:33.115 --> 48:34.881
I just don't mind.

48:36.151 --> 48:40.253
Dying is the only way
you'll let me love you.

48:45.027 --> 48:47.027
I don't know how else to do it.

48:49.131 --> 48:51.965
Beautiful boy.

48:51.967 --> 48:55.669
Willing to sacrifice
everything...

48:56.705 --> 49:00.240
...for the love of me.

49:05.314 --> 49:08.215
(crying): What a beautiful thing
I've made.

49:08.217 --> 49:11.351
¶ You used to call me
on my cell phone ¶

49:11.353 --> 49:15.555
¶ Late night
when you need my love ¶

49:15.557 --> 49:17.891
¶ Call me on my cell phone ¶

49:17.893 --> 49:23.063
¶ Late night
when you need my love ¶

49:23.065 --> 49:24.898
¶ And I know
when that hotline bling. ¶
