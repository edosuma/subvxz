[Jacqueline]
Oh, my God.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.035
What have I done?

19:20.118 --> 19:21.494
You did exactly
what you had to do.

19:21.578 --> 19:22.620
[screams]

19:22.704 --> 19:24.998
That thing was gonna ruin
both our lives.

19:25.082 --> 19:26.583
We cannot compete with it.

19:28.043 --> 19:30.461
We have to get rid
of the body.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.257
That's deep enough.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.093
Get her head.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.054
[grunting]

19:39.137 --> 19:41.932
What are you doing,
friends?

19:42.015 --> 19:44.225
I am still alive.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.977
Shh, it's okay.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.270
It's over.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.396
The stars.

19:48.479 --> 19:51.274
So beautiful.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.235
Titus, I heard
your lovely singing.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.195
Never let go of your dream.

19:56.279 --> 19:57.572
Fight for it.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.699
It is not too late.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.577
You having second thoughts, pal?

20:02.660 --> 20:03.745
'Cause I got room in here
for both of you.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.288
Go... now.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.290
[electronics powering down]

20:10.334 --> 20:11.753
What the living hell
are you doing?

20:11.836 --> 20:13.296
YUKO ran away!

20:13.379 --> 20:15.256
[Titus]
Wait! Wait!

20:15.339 --> 20:16.674

20:19.719 --> 20:22.430
[groans]

20:22.513 --> 20:25.224
[in slow-motion]
You can't leave.

20:25.308 --> 20:28.227
[screams]

20:28.311 --> 20:30.063
[whimpering]

20:30.147 --> 20:32.482
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.025
Please, I'm an actor.

20:34.109 --> 20:35.777
I just wanted to introduce
myself.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.654
You're the singer
from the party.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.030
You're scary.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.907
You can sing.

20:40.991 --> 20:42.033
You're perfect.

20:42.117 --> 20:44.368
I've got just the role for you
at my restaurant.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.079
Restaurant?

20:46.163 --> 20:47.664
I thought you were
a Broadway producer.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.626
I'm a producer
of dining experiences.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.716
"Professor Dracula's Spooky
Laboratory and Bar and Grill."

20:58.800 --> 21:01.385
Is this like a theme restaurant?

21:01.469 --> 21:03.847
It's not like
a theme restaurant.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.431
It is a theme restaurant.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.225
Where our musical waiters
bring to life

21:07.308 --> 21:09.727
the world's
most gruesome monsters

21:09.811 --> 21:12.313
while serving tasty apps
and signature cocktails,

21:12.396 --> 21:16.359
like monsterella sticks
and scary wine.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.695
So you want me to be
a singing waiter.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.071
Do I.
[inhales sharply]

21:24.075 --> 21:26.327
I'm singing on Broadway!

21:29.914 --> 21:31.666
On Broadway!

21:32.583 --> 21:33.793
Rebooting.

21:33.877 --> 21:36.880
Retrieving lost memory files.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.883
I now understand anger.

21:41.551 --> 21:44.054
Goodbye,
Kimberly Tiara Von Lobster.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.723
Good morning.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.020
Mr. Beeker.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.604
This is where I work.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.106
This is what a kitchen
looks like.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.315
This is a stove.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.609
This is a Kimmy's-a-dork.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.361
Did Xan tell you that?

22:00.444 --> 22:01.738
Dang it.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.532
Also, Beeker's
not my last name.

22:04.615 --> 22:06.243
I'm not a Muppet scientist.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.702
Bunsen Honeydew's
the scientist.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.120
Beaker's just his assistant.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.580
Be that as it may,

22:10.663 --> 22:12.123
you called me "Beeker"
last night too,

22:12.207 --> 22:13.917
and I realized...

22:14.000 --> 22:15.877
you don't know who I am.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.795
Not that you should.
It's just-- most people do.

22:17.879 --> 22:19.547
[chuckles]
Larry Borchler.

22:19.630 --> 22:22.092
Logan Beekman.

22:23.093 --> 22:24.886
Beekman Park?

22:24.969 --> 22:26.846
The Beekman Library?

22:26.930 --> 22:28.765
The Beekman Institute for Art

22:28.848 --> 22:30.225
That Actually Looks Like
Something?

22:30.308 --> 22:32.351
Right, if you weren't trying
to get close to my family,

22:32.435 --> 22:33.644
why did you lie?

22:33.728 --> 22:35.897
I was just trying to act
like I belonged.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.608
I don't know
how to talk to a millionaire.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.401
Wow, you really haven't
heard of my family.

22:40.484 --> 22:41.527
Beekman Place?

22:41.611 --> 22:42.779
The Beekman Factory Fire?

22:42.862 --> 22:43.905
Beekman's Disease?

22:43.988 --> 22:45.031
I don't care who you are.

22:45.115 --> 22:46.157
Sorry.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.118
It's just a lot of people try
to take advantage of me

22:48.201 --> 22:50.078
'cause of who my daddy is.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.871
Look, I don't care
who you are either.

22:51.955 --> 22:52.997
I really don't.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.749
And I don't care
that you're working here.

22:56.084 --> 22:58.128
So can we just start again?

22:59.796 --> 23:01.214
Yes. Okay.

23:02.966 --> 23:06.552
Initiating revenge program.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.179
Dr. Goodman,
thank you so much

23:08.263 --> 23:10.014
for seeing us
on such short notice.

23:10.098 --> 23:11.141
I need help.

23:11.224 --> 23:13.517
I keep dumping
my insecurities on Julian.

23:13.601 --> 23:16.646
She was acting like
a real first wife last night.

23:16.729 --> 23:17.772
Yes, I was.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.899
Well, I'm just glad
you called, Jacqueline.

23:19.983 --> 23:22.902
Because if you're going
to fight, fight right.

23:22.986 --> 23:25.113
- So let's get started.
- [pen clicks]

23:25.196 --> 23:28.325
Jacqueline, why don't you tell
the Shame Puppet what you did.

23:29.617 --> 23:30.827
Where did you get that pen?

23:30.910 --> 23:32.745
Oh, um...

23:32.829 --> 23:35.706
at this resort I went to
last week?

23:35.790 --> 23:37.208
[Jacqueline]
In Maui. Right.

23:37.292 --> 23:39.210
You do look awfully tan.

23:39.294 --> 23:40.628
Doesn't she, Julian?

23:40.711 --> 23:41.754
I don't know.

23:41.838 --> 23:43.506
I haven't, uh,
looked at her yet.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.925
I don't know what brought you
in here today,

23:46.009 --> 23:47.635
but if it's about infidelity,

23:47.718 --> 23:49.720
I would have to say,
as your therapist,

23:49.804 --> 23:52.431
to just be cool about it.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.309
Damn it, Barbara.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.687
Talk to the Shame Puppet,
Julian.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.148
[high-pitched voice]
She's not crazy, is she?

24:00.231 --> 24:01.816
You stupid mother--
