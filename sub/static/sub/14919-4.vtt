WEBVTT

00:10.956 --> 00:19.036
You are my light in a dark
city you fill the void

00:20.056 --> 00:24.007
of the day you are my love

00:24.008 --> 00:24.890
where you going?

00:25.135 --> 00:26.945
Shh. Go back to bed.

00:27.071 --> 00:28.739
I was gonna say the
same thing to you.

00:29.025 --> 00:31.038
I don't know if we should've
done this, Justin.

00:32.837 --> 00:33.762
I guess it's a little weird,

00:33.763 --> 00:35.347
with us being technically
divorced and all.

00:35.348 --> 00:37.573
No, there's no "technically."
We're divorced.

00:42.193 --> 00:42.620
Justin...

00:42.621 --> 00:44.508
what? Am I not allowed
to think that's hot?

00:46.396 --> 00:48.537
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna cook you breakfast. What?

00:48.538 --> 00:51.010
Yep. I learned how to make
this amazing breakfast

00:51.011 --> 00:52.882
in Afghanistan, and guess what.

00:52.883 --> 00:55.307
I'm gonna cook it for you.
Oh, really? What breakfast?

00:55.308 --> 00:56.779
Um, Sandy eggs

00:56.853 --> 00:59.847
and water that may or may
not have cholera in it.

00:59.848 --> 01:02.104
You can't pass that up.
No, you can't pass that up.

01:02.397 --> 01:04.140
So I'm gonna start
grinding the sand.

01:08.759 --> 01:09.590
Yeah?

01:09.813 --> 01:11.540
You are my friend

01:11.569 --> 01:12.849
nothing. You need help?

01:13.993 --> 01:15.367
No. I got it.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.737
...Rains

01:18.409 --> 01:20.711
you are my light

01:25.159 --> 01:25.879
hey, babe.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.452
What are you doing? I thought
the costumes were finished.

01:28.453 --> 01:30.763
No, lady capulet's
cloak was too plain,

01:30.764 --> 01:31.732
so I had to add some trim.

01:31.733 --> 01:33.371
And friar Lawrence is
a complete disaster,

01:33.372 --> 01:35.261
so I have to rip him
up and start again.

01:35.312 --> 01:36.807
Come jogging with me.
You need a break.

01:36.808 --> 01:38.387
How can you say that?

01:38.388 --> 01:39.845
The ladies from the
drama committee

01:39.846 --> 01:42.086
are gonna be here at 10:00
to pick all of this up.

01:42.092 --> 01:45.006
Why are you so afraid of this
ladies committee? I'm not afraid.

01:45.007 --> 01:47.704
It's just that Gloria
pierson-Davenport

01:47.705 --> 01:50.439
happens to be associate
director of admissions

01:50.440 --> 01:51.896
at Flintwood academy.

01:52.148 --> 01:55.515
And Bitsy Fairbanks'
husband donated $1 million

01:55.537 --> 01:57.456
to the Flintwood library fund.

01:58.064 --> 01:59.392
Ouch! Damn it.

01:59.398 --> 02:03.304
Every year, five places
open up in the sixth grade.

02:03.305 --> 02:04.137
Okay?

02:04.692 --> 02:06.668
I am gonna get one
of them for Cooper,

02:06.669 --> 02:08.508
even if I have to bleed to death.

02:09.952 --> 02:11.440
Listen, honey, c-could you just...

02:11.441 --> 02:13.936
Go jogging or something? It's...
it's distracting me.

02:14.412 --> 02:15.197
Okay.

02:15.809 --> 02:18.376
Mom. Mom, it's me.
Could you please call me?

02:18.377 --> 02:19.241
Mm.

02:19.499 --> 02:21.245
Oh. Ah.

02:21.704 --> 02:25.015
Ah. Hey, kev.

02:25.016 --> 02:27.659
Just calling to see how it's
going up there. Everything's...

02:27.660 --> 02:28.620
Everything's fine.

02:28.624 --> 02:30.016
You sure? What's that sound?

02:30.188 --> 02:33.030
I'm just pounding a
very stubborn pole.

02:33.031 --> 02:35.263
Ooh. Really? I once spent
a hot weekend in Aspen

02:35.264 --> 02:36.560
with a guy from warsaw.

02:36.785 --> 02:38.991
00 in the morning. That's gross.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.955
I am pounding a wooden post...

02:40.956 --> 02:43.709
Into the ground because I am
helping to build a pergola

02:43.816 --> 02:45.506
on Pondfield road.

02:45.507 --> 02:47.323
Okay, whatever it is
you're trying to hide,

02:47.324 --> 02:48.895
you're gonna have to come
up with a better story.

02:48.896 --> 02:50.619
Okay, go to video,
and I'll prove it.

02:50.620 --> 02:51.421
Going video.

02:52.861 --> 02:54.891
Okay. Do you see this cut?

02:54.957 --> 02:56.495
Mm-hmm. I made that cut.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.887
How many former senatorial
candidates do you know

02:58.888 --> 03:01.390
that could make a cut like that?
Wait, is that Jack,

03:01.391 --> 03:03.572
the guy I met,
the one you cooked dinner for?

03:03.573 --> 03:05.492
Kitty cooked dinner for a guy?
I'm impressed.

03:05.493 --> 03:07.278
So did this pounding
start this morning,

03:07.279 --> 03:08.464
or was it continuous?

03:08.900 --> 03:11.000
This morning. This morning, okay?

03:11.001 --> 03:13.091
And... and... this is
purely professional.

03:13.092 --> 03:14.979
I am the apprentice,
and he is the boss.

03:14.980 --> 03:16.693
That Kevin? Oh, let me say hi.

03:17.749 --> 03:19.171
All right. Well,
you behave yourself.

03:20.648 --> 03:22.153
Hey. How's it going?

03:22.568 --> 03:24.039
Hi, I'm Scotty.

03:24.624 --> 03:25.968
Hey, Scotty. Nice to meet you.

03:26.209 --> 03:27.312
Okay. That's enough.

03:27.684 --> 03:29.011
Nice work, Kitty. I'm impressed.

03:29.012 --> 03:31.295
You know what? There is
zero going on up here.

03:31.296 --> 03:35.100
I am just helping him with a job.
Come on! Give us another look!

03:35.101 --> 03:37.085
No. This is not a peep show. Oh.

03:37.575 --> 03:40.067
Speaking of shows,
are we seeing you at Cooper's play?

03:40.068 --> 03:42.095
No, I-I'm not gonna
leave here for a while.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.417
Sarah is fine with it,
and I sent Cooper cookies.

03:44.418 --> 03:47.745
Now if you'll excuse me,
my poles need to be drilled.

03:49.617 --> 03:51.200
All right, I'm done
harassing her for the day.

03:51.201 --> 03:52.113
Now it's your turn.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.660
If she can get that far
out of her comfort zone,

03:54.661 --> 03:57.376
I think you could invite your
friend to coop's stage debut.

03:57.377 --> 03:59.937
Please. I am not inviting
Charlie to a family affair.

03:59.991 --> 04:01.223
We're just friends.

04:01.319 --> 04:02.881
Okay, seeing somebody
three times a week

04:02.916 --> 04:04.191
is pretty advanced for a friend.

04:04.192 --> 04:05.476
Yeah, aren't you, uh,

04:05.477 --> 04:07.776
aren't you having brunch
with him today? Yeah, so?

04:07.777 --> 04:09.957
Yeah. Do you always spray
on a little Acqua di Parma

04:09.958 --> 04:12.749
for a casual brunch? Take the
cashmere out of the cedar closet?

04:12.776 --> 04:16.076
Wind up the Patek Philippe? Ooh,
brush off the suede loafers?

04:16.077 --> 04:17.144
Trim your cuticles?

04:17.144 --> 04:21.071
Would you stop? Just stop. Stop.
Has it ever occurred to you

04:21.072 --> 04:22.856
that perhaps he doesn't like
me as much as I like him?

04:22.857 --> 04:24.443
Oh, come on. How could he not?

04:24.444 --> 04:27.900
I don't know, but until
there's incontrovertible proof

04:27.901 --> 04:29.576
that he does,
I am not inviting him

04:29.577 --> 04:32.601
to my great nephew's production of
"Romeo and Juliet,"

04:32.617 --> 04:33.449
and that's it.

04:33.972 --> 04:35.572
And just shut up. Oh.

04:42.940 --> 04:44.364
Can you pass the milk?

04:44.812 --> 04:45.740
Yeah, sure.

04:51.527 --> 04:52.519
Are you okay?

04:52.952 --> 04:55.325
Yeah. No, just, um... tired.

04:55.326 --> 04:57.068
I didn't sleep very
much last night.

04:57.538 --> 05:00.498
Well, I happen to have
the cure for that.

05:00.749 --> 05:03.792
Triple shot oaxacan coffee,

05:03.793 --> 05:05.808
cinnamon, and a dash
of cocoa, right?

05:06.741 --> 05:09.091
Sorry. It's my dad. Hi.

05:09.128 --> 05:11.927
Your mother was in bad shape
after you left last night.

05:11.965 --> 05:13.405
She kept forgetting things.

05:13.703 --> 05:15.829
It's like she took
ten steps backwards.

05:15.923 --> 05:16.707
Oh, no. What is it?

05:16.708 --> 05:19.956
I-I woke up in the middle
of the night, she was gone.

05:20.443 --> 05:22.255
Well, where did she go?
I don't know.

05:22.256 --> 05:25.360
I-I just called the police.
So she's just out there?

05:25.760 --> 05:27.667
I always love coming here, Sarah.

05:27.668 --> 05:29.103
The second you walk in this house,

05:29.104 --> 05:31.812
you know people live in it.

05:33.149 --> 05:33.516
Yeah.

05:33.517 --> 05:35.720
Me? I am so terminally o.C.D.,

05:35.725 --> 05:38.935
one pillow upside down,
and I am calling my support group.

05:38.936 --> 05:40.139
I'm exactly the same.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.575
The real secret is to buy a house

05:42.576 --> 05:44.627
as cozy and manageable
as this one is.

05:44.628 --> 05:45.251
Right. That's...

05:45.252 --> 05:47.835
that way, you don't need a
whole army of third worlders

05:47.836 --> 05:50.312
running around losing your socks
and shrinking your sweaters.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.721
You are a very smart woman, Sarah.

05:54.836 --> 05:56.598
Well, 'bout time to get those

05:56.599 --> 05:57.695
costumes to the school.
Oh, God. You know what?

05:57.696 --> 06:00.207
I have to say,
I caught the last rehearsal.

06:00.208 --> 06:02.912
Your Tucker as tybalt floored me.

06:03.995 --> 06:04.950
Incredible. Oh, thank you.

06:04.951 --> 06:07.900
I would hope so after the
coaching he got from Denzel.

06:08.980 --> 06:10.880
So are the costumes done? Oh,
God. Yes.

06:10.881 --> 06:12.654
Um, we're almost there.

06:12.655 --> 06:14.655
I am a little bit
of a perfectionist.

06:14.656 --> 06:18.001
And I'm not 100% happy with
the beading on Romeo's vest.

06:18.153 --> 06:20.991
Also, Benvolio's collar to me

06:20.992 --> 06:22.490
is a little more
French than Italian,

06:22.491 --> 06:25.361
so if I could just take, like,
a couple of hours and...

06:26.828 --> 06:27.948
Oh, uh...

06:28.277 --> 06:29.655
Um, uh,

06:29.656 --> 06:33.185
Luc, y-you met Bitsy
and Gloria? See?

06:33.186 --> 06:33.763
No. Enchante.

06:33.764 --> 06:35.056
Hi. How are you?

06:35.057 --> 06:36.481
Gloria. Hi.

06:38.348 --> 06:39.181
Hi.

06:39.899 --> 06:40.780
Hi.

06:42.825 --> 06:45.096
Okay, Sarah,
can I just kill you now?

06:45.377 --> 06:48.695
Gorgeous, French,
an artist, a celebrity,

06:48.696 --> 06:50.809
and so... young.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.875
Yeah. Well, you know, I got lucky.

06:54.328 --> 06:56.163
What an awesome life experience

06:56.164 --> 06:57.312
you're giving to your kids,

06:57.577 --> 07:00.504
exposing them to so much
at such a young age.

07:02.468 --> 07:03.975
Yeah. We'll see you at the show.

07:03.976 --> 07:05.779
Yes. Uh, yeah, look,
I'll be there.

07:05.780 --> 07:08.404
You won't be disappointed.
They'll be incredible.

07:09.921 --> 07:10.672
Au revoir.

07:11.428 --> 07:12.588
Good luck finishing.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.320
Excuse me, miss.

07:17.321 --> 07:20.056
Can you please tell me where
Sarah Walker has gone to?

07:20.332 --> 07:21.688
Because if Sarah Walker was here,

07:21.689 --> 07:22.706
those two especes de putains

07:22.707 --> 07:24.475
would not have walked
out of this house alive.

07:24.476 --> 07:26.392
Luc, just don't even start, okay?

07:26.393 --> 07:28.235
Trust me. If that's the
way they're treating you,

07:28.236 --> 07:30.312
there's no way Cooper is
gonna get into this school.

07:30.313 --> 07:33.784
No, they're testing me,
and I will pass.

07:35.443 --> 07:36.643
All right.
I'm gonna take a shower.

07:36.644 --> 07:37.799
Oh, come on, Luc.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.767
You know, some of us have
to live in the real world.

07:39.768 --> 07:42.632
We can't all be artists
and underwear models.

07:42.713 --> 07:45.843
Sarah, honey, I'm sorry I didn't
get your message before this,

07:45.844 --> 07:46.683
but not to worry.

07:46.684 --> 07:48.140
The cavalry is on its way,

07:48.141 --> 07:51.836
armed with pinking shears and
a fully loaded pin cushion.

07:52.044 --> 07:54.891
Oh, somebody's at the door.
Listen, I'll see you soon.

07:55.155 --> 07:58.420
Romeo will not go naked
onto that good stage.

07:58.446 --> 07:59.520
Bye.

08:00.451 --> 08:03.668
Is William here?
I need to see him.

08:04.575 --> 08:06.615
That's not possible, holly.
You know that's not possible.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.796
So you know who I am?
He told you about me?

08:08.797 --> 08:11.484
I know who you are.
Look, I-I know that you hate me,

08:11.965 --> 08:13.864
but I need to talk to him, please.

08:13.865 --> 08:15.666
Just for one minute.
Then I promise you

08:15.667 --> 08:17.636
that I will never,
ever come here ever again.

08:17.637 --> 08:20.768
Holly, listen to me.
There has been an accident. No.

08:20.769 --> 08:21.907
You were hurt. You're confused.

08:21.908 --> 08:23.896
You're not gonna stop
me from seeing him.

08:23.897 --> 08:26.011
William! William!

08:26.012 --> 08:29.107
Holly, William is dead.
He's dead, holly.

08:29.108 --> 08:30.324
He died five years ago.

08:33.967 --> 08:35.136
Oh, my God.

08:36.321 --> 08:38.047
Wh-what am I doing here?

08:38.541 --> 08:40.027
What is happening to me?

08:40.028 --> 08:42.524
I don't know. Y-you've
been trying to get better.

08:43.203 --> 08:44.439
Nora, help me.

08:45.679 --> 08:47.744
Please... help me.

08:54.469 --> 08:56.340
Okay, did you check the old
apartment on Edgecliff?

08:56.341 --> 08:58.416
Okay, officer, this is not
just a missing person.

08:58.424 --> 08:59.847
This is a woman with significant

08:59.848 --> 09:01.760
cognitive impairment.
Oh, my God. I don't...

09:01.761 --> 09:03.568
All right. Well, thank you,
and I'll check back later.

09:05.041 --> 09:06.503
Okay, mom, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.257
Holly is missing and... what?

09:09.293 --> 09:10.673
Um, yeah. No, Rebecca's
right here. Hold on.

09:10.674 --> 09:12.483
I'll put you on speaker.
Hold on one second.

09:12.525 --> 09:16.491
She's here, Rebecca.
She's here. She's fine.

09:16.492 --> 09:17.984
Thank God. Dad, she's at Nora's.

09:17.985 --> 09:21.171
Okay, mom, we're coming right over.
No, just sit tight.

09:21.172 --> 09:23.713
She made me promise I wouldn't
let you all descend upon her,

09:23.714 --> 09:25.297
so just stay where you are.

09:25.971 --> 09:27.380
Tell David I'll call him.

09:27.649 --> 09:28.562
Okay.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:39.574 --> 09:40.612
Uh, with the grain.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.772
You always want to try
to stay with the grain.

09:43.156 --> 09:45.796
Oh, okay. I get it. I get it.

09:48.691 --> 09:50.035
How do I know when I'm finished?

09:50.036 --> 09:51.536
When it feels like silk.

09:51.537 --> 09:53.022
Yeah, well, silk, I know.

09:54.569 --> 09:55.592
Whew.

09:56.789 --> 09:59.158
Wow. You know,
it really is beautiful.

09:59.428 --> 10:00.292
It will be.

10:00.644 --> 10:02.180
I mean, if you made...

10:03.125 --> 10:05.411
Dining room chairs or... or a bed,

10:05.412 --> 10:06.460
do you have any idea

10:06.461 --> 10:08.284
what you could sell
it for in New York?

10:08.392 --> 10:09.944
I mean, I know a dealer in soho,

10:09.945 --> 10:10.911
and I could introduce you,

10:10.912 --> 10:13.682
and oh, my gosh,
you would make a fortune.

10:16.710 --> 10:17.174
Here.

10:17.175 --> 10:19.577
You wanna try to
use longer strokes,

10:20.008 --> 10:21.080
like this.

10:24.683 --> 10:25.924
There you go.

10:28.090 --> 10:30.928
You know, I-I also went
to school with a woman

10:30.929 --> 10:33.516
who is an editor now of
"architectural digest."

10:33.517 --> 10:36.379
And she could probably do
a very big spread on you.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.684
I mean, you would have
to open up a factory

10:38.685 --> 10:40.334
for all the work
that you would get.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.368
Kitty, are you trying

10:42.369 --> 10:44.383
to figure out something
new about yourself

10:44.384 --> 10:45.905
or are you trying to change me?

10:46.932 --> 10:48.707
No. No, no.

10:48.708 --> 10:52.815
I'm... no, I-I like you
fine just the way you are.

10:52.816 --> 10:55.127
Well, that's good,
'cause I wouldn't want a factory.

10:55.128 --> 10:56.727
You get tied down.

10:56.728 --> 10:58.505
You always know what's
gonna happen next.

10:58.506 --> 11:00.495
Yeah, yeah. No, exactly.

11:00.496 --> 11:02.503
That's one of the reasons I
came up here in the first place,

11:02.504 --> 11:05.200
to see, you know,
how it would feel

11:05.201 --> 11:07.788
if I didn't know exactly
what was gonna happen next.

11:07.789 --> 11:08.829
And how does it feel?

11:09.801 --> 11:12.527
Well, it's, uh, it's scary.

11:12.528 --> 11:13.600
Scary's good.

11:14.031 --> 11:15.680
Once you cut the ropes,

11:15.745 --> 11:16.928
anything can happen.

11:18.573 --> 11:20.892
Yeah. Yeah, it... mm.

11:33.732 --> 11:35.540
Okay, so, I'm, um...

11:36.617 --> 11:38.023
I'm supposed to just...

11:39.245 --> 11:40.780
Go with the grain, right?

11:41.857 --> 11:42.611
That's right.

11:42.612 --> 11:43.476
Right.

11:44.020 --> 11:46.035
Okay, uh, where's
my grommet puncher?

11:46.036 --> 11:48.667
I just had it.
It was just here a second ago.

11:48.668 --> 11:50.364
You have it.
That's my grommet puncher.

11:50.365 --> 11:52.372
Keep track of your own grommet puncher.
Well, where is mine?

11:52.373 --> 11:55.548
I can't finish lady capulet's
dress without a grommet puncher.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.733
It's right here, Sarah.

11:56.955 --> 11:59.640
Thank you, Charlie. And thank
you for giving up your brunch

11:59.741 --> 12:02.127
to come and help me
with my wardrobe crisis.

12:02.128 --> 12:03.888
It's no problem whatsoever.

12:04.119 --> 12:05.884
You've eaten one eggs florentine,

12:05.885 --> 12:06.595
you've eaten 'em all.

12:06.596 --> 12:08.339
Right, and I'm very
happy to pinch hit

12:08.340 --> 12:10.212
when my sister's on
a mission of mercy.

12:10.213 --> 12:12.376
Well, it took us two
crises to finally meet you,

12:12.432 --> 12:14.580
Charlie. Before we
have a third, Kevin,

12:14.989 --> 12:15.935
might I suggest

12:15.936 --> 12:18.251
that when you're fixing
a skirt to a doublet,

12:18.252 --> 12:20.108
you may want to try
a cartridge pleat.

12:20.258 --> 12:22.231
Well, I thought with
velvet this heavy,

12:22.232 --> 12:24.436
I'd be better off
basting and gathering.

12:27.748 --> 12:28.479
Ah.

12:28.549 --> 12:29.667
Well, Juliet's done.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.426
Let me get my hands on Mercutio.

12:32.427 --> 12:36.832
Oh, my God. Charlie,
this beading is extraordinary.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.670
Well, I guess the hours I spent

12:38.671 --> 12:41.388
slaving in the costume
mines of the Paris opera

12:41.389 --> 12:42.600
are finally paying off.

12:42.601 --> 12:45.131
Wait a minute. You... you made
costumes at the Paris opera?

12:45.132 --> 12:46.572
Well, just for a semester...

12:47.003 --> 12:51.107
When I was studying at the sorbonne,
'65. '65 was the year

12:51.108 --> 12:54.247
Renata Tebaldi sang
"Lucia di Lammmermoor." The performance

12:54.248 --> 12:56.320
where she held the high c of
"il dolce suono"... right.

12:56.398 --> 12:58.091
For a minute and a half.
Right, they had to flash the lights

12:58.210 --> 13:00.850
to get the crowd to stop cheering.
Didn't stop me.

13:00.917 --> 13:02.099
You heard it?

13:02.605 --> 13:04.220
I heard it from the costume shop,

13:04.221 --> 13:05.805
but I heard it.

13:06.323 --> 13:07.620
Oh, my God. Look at the time.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.459
I can feel the claws of
Gloria pierson-Davenport

13:11.460 --> 13:13.087
into my flesh.

13:13.088 --> 13:15.367
Ah. Nice timing, Cooper.
Come here.

13:15.368 --> 13:17.475
I wanna make sure this
doublet's long enough on you.

13:17.476 --> 13:18.515
You should be checking to see

13:18.516 --> 13:20.443
if it's long enough
for Ricky berkowitz.

13:20.444 --> 13:22.051
Why? Who's Ricky berkowitz?

13:22.052 --> 13:25.244
The understudy. He's the one
who's gonna need the costume,

13:25.251 --> 13:27.044
'cause I'm quitting
the stupid play.

13:34.594 --> 13:36.195
Holly, you've been
in there a while.

13:36.196 --> 13:37.125
Are you all right?

13:41.228 --> 13:42.461
Holly, say something.

13:45.116 --> 13:48.077
I can't keep doing this.

13:48.772 --> 13:51.028
You've been getting
so much better.

13:52.879 --> 13:54.224
You don't get it.

13:54.789 --> 13:56.287
The more I remember,

13:56.288 --> 13:59.839
the more I realize
how much I have lost.

14:03.159 --> 14:05.336
I saw Rebecca last night.

14:06.048 --> 14:08.304
I know she is my daughter.

14:09.524 --> 14:12.024
But she doesn't
mean anything to me.

14:12.327 --> 14:14.319
Well, you have to
keep talking to her.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.272
Be patient with yourself.

14:19.496 --> 14:22.152
I-I can't go on living like this.

14:26.307 --> 14:27.636
What are you doing in there?

14:28.229 --> 14:30.965
Holly, open the door!
Open the door!

14:32.714 --> 14:33.416
Holly!

14:33.688 --> 14:35.737
H-holly, listen, listen,

14:35.738 --> 14:37.223
the doctors keep saying

14:37.224 --> 14:39.976
that you go on improving
as long as you fight.

14:41.462 --> 14:44.539
I've called you a lot of things
in my life, holly Harper,

14:44.540 --> 14:46.412
but "coward" is not one of them.

14:47.396 --> 14:48.293
Look...

14:48.472 --> 14:50.887
Holly, you have so many
people who love you.

14:50.888 --> 14:52.731
There's... there's David and Rebecca

14:52.732 --> 14:54.367
and me, for God sakes.

14:54.368 --> 14:57.984
We don't give a damn if you
remember who we are or not.

14:58.532 --> 14:59.845
Look, you have no right

14:59.846 --> 15:01.476
to cause the pain you would cause

15:01.477 --> 15:03.060
if you do something stupid.

15:03.541 --> 15:04.311
Open the door!

15:04.312 --> 15:06.991
Holly, open this door,
or I'm gonna kick it in!

15:06.992 --> 15:08.513
Open the door!

15:09.752 --> 15:11.496
You don't need to do that.

15:18.464 --> 15:19.628
What are you doing?

15:20.632 --> 15:21.624
I don't know.

15:23.168 --> 15:25.489
I don't even know how I got here.

15:26.976 --> 15:28.816
I could've killed somebody.

15:29.016 --> 15:30.088
But you didn't.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.135
I think you need to take me

15:35.136 --> 15:36.447
to the hospital.

15:38.983 --> 15:40.295
I don't understand, Cooper.

15:40.296 --> 15:42.434
You were so excited
when you got this role,

15:42.435 --> 15:44.087
and wh-why are you doing this now?

15:44.088 --> 15:47.450
'Cause Shakespeare's stupid,
and wearing tights is stupid,

15:47.472 --> 15:48.407
and I'm not doing it!

15:48.408 --> 15:49.887
Okay, you know,
everybody is gonna think

15:49.888 --> 15:52.668
that you're a quitter.
I don't care. I'm done!

15:52.669 --> 15:54.096
Would you please tell me why?

15:54.097 --> 15:55.696
And don't tell me it's
because of the tights,

15:55.697 --> 15:58.344
because will ferrell wears tights in-
-In "blades of glory,"

15:58.345 --> 15:59.735
and you watch that movie
three times a week.

15:59.736 --> 16:00.672
Yeah, well, will ferrell

16:00.673 --> 16:03.201
doesn't have to kiss
any stupid, gross girl!

16:04.460 --> 16:06.239
Is that... is that
what this is about?

16:06.240 --> 16:09.235
You think that Margaret
Hartley is gross?

16:09.236 --> 16:11.291
I don't think it. I know it.

16:11.292 --> 16:13.974
And besides, you don't even
care about the play anyway.

16:13.975 --> 16:16.960
You just want to kiss butt so I
can get into some lame school

16:16.961 --> 16:19.120
I don't even want to go to.
Okay, mister.

16:19.121 --> 16:20.247
No child of mind is gonna

16:20.248 --> 16:21.608
let down their classmates...
Sarah. Sarah.

16:21.609 --> 16:24.401
On the day that... what? Love,
c-can we have a minute, please?

16:24.402 --> 16:26.991
You talk sense into him.
He has no idea that the decision

16:26.992 --> 16:28.931
he makes today is gonna
affect the rest of his life.

16:28.932 --> 16:30.845
I'm not talking middle school,
I'm not talking high school.

16:30.846 --> 16:32.572
I'm talking... you okay, bud?

16:35.644 --> 16:36.103
Yeah.

16:36.104 --> 16:37.623
So in all those rehearsals,

16:37.969 --> 16:39.648
you still didn't
kiss this girl yet?

16:39.884 --> 16:43.228
No, I just kinda,
you know, pretended.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.220
Mm-hmm. But Mr. Ingle said that tonight,

16:45.377 --> 16:46.727
I have to actually do it.

16:46.728 --> 16:49.769
And this girl who's playing Juliet-
-Margaret, right? Yeah.

16:49.776 --> 16:50.527
You like her?

16:50.528 --> 16:52.848
No. Ew! Of course not.

16:53.556 --> 16:56.373
Right, but Romeo,
he loves Juliet, right?

16:56.713 --> 16:58.867
Yeah, he says she's like the sun.

16:58.868 --> 17:01.916
Tonight you are Romeo. That's it.

17:01.917 --> 17:03.196
Do what Romeo would do,

17:03.252 --> 17:04.949
and then the kiss will be perfect.

17:05.988 --> 17:06.996
And remember...

17:07.961 --> 17:09.432
You don't kiss with this.

17:10.344 --> 17:11.656
You kiss with this.

17:15.856 --> 17:19.200
Cooper is back in the play.
Yeah, Luc saved the day.

17:19.446 --> 17:21.502
Saul, call Charlie.
He'll be thrilled.

17:21.503 --> 17:23.200
Scotty, Scotty, Scotty,
what have you done?

17:23.201 --> 17:24.115
You've ruined the soup.

17:24.116 --> 17:26.039
There's enough cumin in
here to choke a camel.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.718
Relax. It's an experiment.

17:27.719 --> 17:29.652
Mmm. What is with you?

17:29.653 --> 17:31.975
It's obvious Charlie's
crazy about you.

17:31.976 --> 17:34.711
Yeah, he made half the costumes.
How can you not invite him?

17:34.712 --> 17:36.479
Because I'm crazy about him, too.
That's how.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.868
And... and... and what?

17:38.332 --> 17:39.468
And...

17:41.420 --> 17:43.068
And I haven't told him that I'm...

17:44.449 --> 17:46.327
I mean, I wanted to.
It just hasn't come up.

17:46.328 --> 17:47.931
We have these insane discussions

17:47.932 --> 17:50.651
about travel and opera and...
and... and wine

17:50.652 --> 17:53.343
and... and new wave French cinema.

17:53.344 --> 17:55.412
It... I mean,
what was I supposed to say?

17:55.413 --> 17:57.713
"Oh, Charlie, you know
those great nim scenes from

17:57.801 --> 17:58.779
"the 'last year at Marienbad'?

17:58.780 --> 18:01.042
Oh, by the way,
I'm... I'm h.I.V. Positive."

18:01.169 --> 18:04.059
Saul, I-I think in
this day and age,

18:04.060 --> 18:07.451
two mature, intelligent men can negotiate-
oh, come on, Kevin.

18:07.452 --> 18:09.548
That's not the issue.
It's not the issue.

18:12.556 --> 18:13.686
I'm afraid that if I tell him,

18:13.687 --> 18:15.144
I won't have him anymore.

18:17.237 --> 18:19.940
If you don't tell him,
you won't have him anyway.

18:27.904 --> 18:28.882
Where's Rebecca?

18:28.901 --> 18:31.287
She's with David. They're
talking to the doctor. Good.

18:31.288 --> 18:32.120
Thanks.

18:33.284 --> 18:35.525
Oh, God. I wish there was
something I could do.

18:35.905 --> 18:37.616
It feels like the
night of the accident.

18:37.677 --> 18:39.246
Well, she's much better
than she was then.

18:39.247 --> 18:40.959
We didn't bring her
in on a stretcher.

18:44.309 --> 18:46.171
When I called you this morning,

18:46.172 --> 18:47.560
Rebecca was there.

18:47.561 --> 18:50.632
Does that mean you were together?
Yes, it does.

18:50.673 --> 18:52.279
That's good, right? That's good.

18:52.280 --> 18:53.703
Yeah. Well, yeah.

18:53.704 --> 18:55.481
I mean, I hope so.

18:55.748 --> 18:58.374
Look, obviously we have a
lot of stuff to work out.

18:58.375 --> 19:01.778
But... God, you know,
the... the hardest part is,

19:01.845 --> 19:02.724
now that I've been with her,

19:02.725 --> 19:04.351
I want her back that much more.

19:04.796 --> 19:07.815
You know, when I...
When I see my future, mom,

19:07.816 --> 19:09.504
I see Rebecca standing
right next to me,

19:09.505 --> 19:12.172
and when I imagine what my kids
are gonna look like, it's her,

19:12.173 --> 19:13.052
and...

19:15.015 --> 19:16.169
Oh, Justin.

19:16.876 --> 19:18.627
I know how hard you
work for things.

19:18.628 --> 19:20.839
You're... you'll figure it out.

19:22.488 --> 19:23.336
Yeah.

19:24.052 --> 19:26.432
No, that quote was completely
taken out of context,

19:26.433 --> 19:28.529
and I would like them
to print a correction.

19:29.248 --> 19:31.409
Yes, yes, and an apology.

19:31.616 --> 19:32.943
Yes, thank you.

19:33.742 --> 19:35.631
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.889
I'm so sorry,
but I have to handle this.

19:38.384 --> 19:41.908
Amazing that civilization
managed to last 80,000 years

19:41.909 --> 19:43.064
without cell phones.

19:43.065 --> 19:46.536
Oh, let me guess.
You don't have one.

19:47.196 --> 19:48.396
What was it Gandhi said?

19:49.292 --> 19:51.565
"In silence,
the soul finds the path

19:51.566 --> 19:53.903
in a clearer, brighter light."

19:54.598 --> 19:57.029
You sound like my
sixth grade teacher.

19:57.084 --> 19:59.084
"Silence is golden, Kitty."

19:59.629 --> 20:00.509
Well...

20:00.621 --> 20:02.332
Are you saying I talk too much?

20:03.619 --> 20:06.436
There's nothing wrong
with talking, you know?

20:07.856 --> 20:09.283
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

20:09.284 --> 20:10.629
Yeah? What's that?

20:10.630 --> 20:12.821
You're thinking that I'm
hiding behind my cell phone

20:12.822 --> 20:15.836
because what happened earlier
this afternoon freaked me out,

20:15.848 --> 20:17.231
and I don't know how
to deal with it.

20:17.232 --> 20:19.315
You've been on the phone
pretty much since then.

20:19.316 --> 20:21.599
Cell phones have been a very
important part of my life

20:21.600 --> 20:24.271
long before you and I did
anything crazy and impulsive.

20:24.272 --> 20:26.121
Well, what's wrong with
crazy and impulsive?

20:26.122 --> 20:27.849
Listen, Mr. Gandhi,

20:28.284 --> 20:30.734
what happened over there was
nothing more than a hot day

20:30.735 --> 20:32.979
and a fleeting, brief impulse.

20:33.913 --> 20:35.735
Well, it was about
more than that for me.

20:35.736 --> 20:37.755
Really? Because you
just met me yesterday.

20:37.756 --> 20:39.900
A lot can happen in 24 hours,
Kitty. Oh.

20:40.204 --> 20:41.699
Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think

20:41.700 --> 20:43.411
I'm the only one that's
feeling something here.

20:43.412 --> 20:45.568
You think that I am actually...

20:46.532 --> 20:47.796
Are you serious?

20:48.276 --> 20:51.317
I'm sorry. I'm moving
too fast. Ya think?

20:51.697 --> 20:53.239
I know you just lost your husband.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.160
Yes, I did.

20:55.785 --> 20:58.216
And that's the reason
I came up here,

20:58.228 --> 21:00.932
something that you seem to
know a lot about... quiet.

21:01.553 --> 21:02.596
Do you have any idea

21:02.688 --> 21:05.704
how much noise you just put
into my head? Forgive me.

21:05.705 --> 21:07.539
If you had any idea what
I have been through,

21:07.540 --> 21:09.332
you definitely would
not have kissed me.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.068
Hey. Hey.

21:23.069 --> 21:23.924
Hi. What's going on?

21:23.925 --> 21:26.000
How is she doing? She's sleeping.

21:26.001 --> 21:27.745
Do you want me to
get you anything?

21:27.746 --> 21:29.763
You want some food?
Maybe some yogurt or something.

21:29.764 --> 21:31.163
Sure. Mom,
do you want anything? No,

21:31.164 --> 21:33.468
I think I'm gonna take off.
I'll talk to you guys later.

21:36.269 --> 21:37.644
So my mom wants to see me.

21:39.706 --> 21:41.706
David said it was something
that you said to her.

21:42.817 --> 21:43.824
I just...

21:44.287 --> 21:45.520
Told her you love her.

21:48.984 --> 21:50.312
I-I don't know what to do.

21:50.451 --> 21:51.777
The past two times I've seen her,

21:51.778 --> 21:53.042
it's been a disaster.

21:54.304 --> 21:55.567
What did the doctors say?

21:55.568 --> 21:59.376
That I could either help
jog her memory or...

22:00.351 --> 22:02.481
Make it worse,
like I did last night.

22:02.940 --> 22:05.612
So basically, it's up to
me if I see her or not.

22:06.889 --> 22:07.801
What do you think?

22:08.312 --> 22:10.424
I have too many
decisions to make today.

22:10.704 --> 22:11.696
I'm tired.

22:21.591 --> 22:23.737
Did Justin tell you we
were together last night?

22:24.536 --> 22:25.433
Yes.

22:25.832 --> 22:27.385
But only because I asked.

22:29.311 --> 22:30.128
Nora, um...

22:30.709 --> 22:34.144
I sent out my
photography portfolio,

22:34.145 --> 22:35.712
and, um...

22:36.234 --> 22:37.276
I got offered a job

22:37.277 --> 22:39.372
at "Tribeca"
magazine in New York city.

22:39.903 --> 22:42.007
Oh, my God, Rebecca.
That's wonderful.

22:42.008 --> 22:42.978
That's your dream.

22:42.979 --> 22:43.828
Yeah.

22:44.661 --> 22:46.597
Yeah, it's great. I...

22:47.993 --> 22:49.179
I didn't tell Justin.

22:49.180 --> 22:50.957
I-I just... I couldn't. I didn't...

22:52.276 --> 22:53.414
I didn't know how.

22:54.695 --> 22:56.088
It's not the same with us.

22:58.225 --> 22:59.627
I mean, maybe it doesn't
need to be the same.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.428
Maybe it could be
something different.

23:04.487 --> 23:06.407
I still love him so much.

23:06.476 --> 23:07.755
He loves you, too.

23:08.001 --> 23:08.848
I know.

23:10.260 --> 23:11.157
I know.

23:14.700 --> 23:15.885
What should I do?

23:19.552 --> 23:20.528
I don't know.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.888
I think you need to do
what's right for you.

23:29.085 --> 23:29.980
I'm sorry.

23:30.669 --> 23:32.274
I shouldn't be talking
to you about this

23:32.275 --> 23:33.326
of all people.

23:33.327 --> 23:35.583
It's just, ever since I
came into your family,

23:37.593 --> 23:39.402
you've... you've been
like a mom to me.

23:39.480 --> 23:40.546
Rebecca, listen to me.

23:40.547 --> 23:43.605
You can come to me
with anything, anytime,

23:44.337 --> 23:46.368
no matter what happens
with you and Justin.

23:48.048 --> 23:49.024
Thank you.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.048
Two households,
both alike in dignity,

23:55.083 --> 23:57.271
in fair verona,
where we lay our scene...

23:57.272 --> 24:00.487
Stunning job on the scenery,
Gloria. Thank you.

24:00.796 --> 24:03.212
A pair of star-cross'd
lovers take their life.

24:03.679 --> 24:05.968
Whose misadventured
piteous overthrows...

24:05.969 --> 24:06.992
That one's mine.

24:07.345 --> 24:09.959
Oh, you must be so proud.

24:09.960 --> 24:13.192
Yeah. The velvet on that doublet
was impossible to work with.

24:13.920 --> 24:14.945
...Not remove.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.648
If which you with
patient ears attend,

24:18.153 --> 24:19.463
what you shall miss

24:19.640 --> 24:21.816
our toil shall strive amend.

24:22.824 --> 24:24.362
Is the day so young?

24:24.745 --> 24:25.688
Shh.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.152
Thanks for coming to see me,

24:31.153 --> 24:32.837
though I don't know why you would.

24:32.925 --> 24:36.104
Because you're my mom,
and I love you,

24:36.105 --> 24:37.513
and I'm worried about you.

24:38.556 --> 24:42.493
You know, I wish someone would
just cut the crap for a second.

24:42.751 --> 24:43.475
What do you mean?

24:43.476 --> 24:47.139
Oh, I am just so sick of, "oh,
holly, I love you so much.

24:47.140 --> 24:50.399
"You were the perfect mother.
You were the love of my life.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.145
Oh, you were my best friend."

24:52.208 --> 24:54.880
That's probably why I'm
not getting any better.

24:55.556 --> 24:58.684
All anyone is feeding
me is that b.S.

24:58.685 --> 24:59.981
But I do love you.

25:02.104 --> 25:05.058
I remember enough to know
that anybody who says that

25:05.059 --> 25:08.469
they had a perfect relationship
with their mother is lying.

25:12.172 --> 25:13.292
Okay. Um...

25:13.967 --> 25:14.864
You're right.

25:15.248 --> 25:17.824
Our relationship was
not always perfect.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.575
Well, thank God for that.

25:20.296 --> 25:22.104
I ran away when I was 15.

25:22.636 --> 25:25.997
Mm. I'm sure I gave you
plenty of reasons to.

25:27.072 --> 25:27.936
Some.

25:28.179 --> 25:29.251
But, um...

25:30.675 --> 25:33.141
You know, it was mostly me.

25:33.344 --> 25:34.799
It's a long story.

25:36.137 --> 25:37.544
I've got nothing but time.

25:39.296 --> 25:40.145
Okay.

25:41.437 --> 25:42.653
What lady is that,

25:43.036 --> 25:45.884
which doth enrich the
hand of yonder knight?

25:46.397 --> 25:49.068
O, she doth teach the
torches to burn bright.

25:49.484 --> 25:51.308
Did my heart love till now?

25:51.708 --> 25:53.052
Forswear it, sight!

25:53.448 --> 25:56.161
For I ne'er saw true
beauty till this night.

25:58.853 --> 26:02.517
This, by his voice,
should be a montague.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.479
To strike him dead,
I hold it not a sin.

26:14.965 --> 26:16.540
So then when you and
dad got back together,

26:16.541 --> 26:19.594
it was like I had the
family that I always wanted.

26:19.595 --> 26:20.989
You guys were so happy.

26:22.589 --> 26:25.675
I can't believe that you
lived with Nora Walker

26:25.676 --> 26:27.933
for an entire summer.

26:27.971 --> 26:30.020
You and I weren't even
talking at the time.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.513
But we were good, right,
before the accident?

26:32.514 --> 26:34.989
Oh, we were great. I promise.

26:36.218 --> 26:38.378
I love a story with
a happy ending.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.332
Mm. But what about Justin,

26:40.700 --> 26:42.877
your handsome prince charming?

26:44.317 --> 26:45.309
It's been tough.

26:46.204 --> 26:47.875
Three months after we got married,

26:47.876 --> 26:50.160
he went back to Afghanistan.

26:50.161 --> 26:51.119
Mm.

26:52.928 --> 26:54.512
I mean, you know all about that...

26:54.968 --> 26:56.888
Someone you love going off to war.

26:58.765 --> 27:00.381
I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:01.975 --> 27:02.985
Daniel.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.872
How... how do you know about Daniel?

27:08.873 --> 27:11.032
I never told anybody about him.

27:11.053 --> 27:12.204
You told me...

27:13.052 --> 27:16.308
When I was 18,
how you met in drama class

27:16.309 --> 27:18.069
in freshman year of high school.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.411
On your 16th birthday,

27:20.412 --> 27:23.517
you both drove to Las
Vegas and got married

27:24.027 --> 27:25.531
and never told your parents.

27:25.963 --> 27:27.805
Never told anybody.

27:27.864 --> 27:28.776
Except me.

27:30.561 --> 27:32.770
How when you graduated,
he enlisted...

27:35.424 --> 27:37.201
But he wrote you every single day.

27:37.221 --> 27:38.036
Mm.

27:40.793 --> 27:41.770
Until...

27:42.437 --> 27:45.381
He stepped on a mine in que son.

27:46.653 --> 27:48.205
So every day for a year,

27:50.028 --> 27:50.652
you brought flowers

27:50.653 --> 27:52.671
to the place where
he first kissed you.

27:53.978 --> 27:54.871
Oh.

27:55.968 --> 27:57.166
Rebecca...

27:59.104 --> 28:02.405
If I told you all of that,

28:02.406 --> 28:04.645
I truly must have loved you.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.695
But why don't I feel that now?

28:15.827 --> 28:17.459
I-I'm sorry.

28:24.780 --> 28:25.772
I'm... I'm...

28:25.901 --> 28:27.997
I-I'm so sorry.

28:30.560 --> 28:34.833
But I can't make myself
feel something that I don't.

28:40.658 --> 28:43.266
Have not saints lips,
and holy Palmers, too?

28:43.267 --> 28:46.280
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they
must be used in prayer...

28:46.281 --> 28:48.680
This is it. This is when they kiss.
I know the play, you know?

28:48.681 --> 28:51.604
Shh. Shh. They pray, grant thou,

28:51.605 --> 28:53.316
lest faith turn to despair.

28:53.317 --> 28:56.316
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

28:56.317 --> 28:59.293
Then move not while my
prayer's effect I take.

28:59.925 --> 29:02.180
Thus from my lips, by yours,

29:02.432 --> 29:03.714
my sin is purged.

29:34.729 --> 29:35.913
Oh!

29:39.649 --> 29:42.372
Of course I will pay
for any cost incurred...

29:42.373 --> 29:44.573
well, that's not gonna help
that traumatized little girl.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.444
Well, I-I don't think
she'll be too traumatized.

29:46.737 --> 29:49.784
Cooper apologized to her,
and he says she's fine,

29:49.785 --> 29:51.785
and she's backstage eating pizza.

29:51.786 --> 29:52.985
Well, she wouldn't
be the first female

29:52.986 --> 29:55.018
to self-medicate
with carbohydrates.

29:55.169 --> 29:57.228
Well, I'm sure she's
a little embarrassed,

29:57.229 --> 29:58.331
but she'll be fine.

29:58.332 --> 30:00.113
How can you be sure about
somebody else's child

30:00.114 --> 30:02.099
when you obviously have
no control over your own?

30:02.100 --> 30:03.936
Well, I will be talking to Cooper.

30:03.937 --> 30:06.066
And I will tell him
in no uncertain terms

30:06.067 --> 30:07.762
that he crossed a
boundary tonight.

30:07.763 --> 30:09.707
I don't think I'm looking
at the best source

30:09.708 --> 30:11.175
for a lesson in boundaries.

30:11.362 --> 30:14.282
What, with the images of
a nearly naked co-parent

30:14.283 --> 30:16.058
plastered on every
billboard in town.

30:16.059 --> 30:17.232
I think what we saw here tonight

30:17.233 --> 30:18.895
is the direct result
of being raised

30:18.896 --> 30:20.634
in an oversexualized home.

30:21.333 --> 30:24.870
You're right.
You are absolutely right.

30:24.871 --> 30:26.235
What... what a terrible,

30:26.236 --> 30:28.456
terrible thing I've
done to my children.

30:28.457 --> 30:30.740
Terrible. I'm so sorry about that.

30:30.741 --> 30:33.932
How completely irresponsible
of me to have shacked up

30:33.933 --> 30:35.274
with a slightly younger artist

30:35.275 --> 30:37.970
who I am passionately
and deeply in love with

30:37.971 --> 30:41.041
instead of snaring a
considerably older gazillionaire

30:41.042 --> 30:42.935
with pending indictments
on how many charges

30:42.936 --> 30:44.632
of tax evasion and mail fraud?

30:44.633 --> 30:47.598
And you, Gloria, I really
should've raised my children

30:47.599 --> 30:49.515
exactly the way you have.

30:49.516 --> 30:52.296
How I envy the structure
of your household.

30:52.297 --> 30:55.192
Week in and week out,
we all know every Tuesday,

30:55.193 --> 30:57.347
it's the pool boy
in the guest house.

30:57.348 --> 31:00.502
Come Thursday, it's landscape
dude up there in the library.

31:00.503 --> 31:02.326
Why I think you're
probably the last woman

31:02.327 --> 31:05.776
in southern California that
actually has a milkman.

31:05.777 --> 31:07.800
Sarah, is everything okay?

31:07.801 --> 31:10.051
It's fine. In fact,
you know what? It's great.

31:10.351 --> 31:12.170
Come over here,
you sexy French beast.

31:12.171 --> 31:15.834
Let's go home and do some
nearly naked co-parenting.

31:19.384 --> 31:22.297
Shakespeare has certainly
changed since I was in school.

31:22.534 --> 31:23.460
Charlie...

31:24.746 --> 31:27.446
Everything's changed
since we were in school.

31:27.447 --> 31:29.775
I played Romeo once in college.

31:29.776 --> 31:30.677
You did?

31:32.418 --> 31:35.655
And I played third spear
carrier from the left,

31:36.018 --> 31:37.154
and I dropped it.

31:40.030 --> 31:42.083
You know, there are certain
lines I've never forgotten.

31:44.495 --> 31:47.876
O, that I were a
glove upon that hand,

31:49.187 --> 31:51.037
that I might touch that cheek.

32:00.329 --> 32:01.842
So are you sure you
want to do this?

32:01.925 --> 32:03.001
I'm positive.

32:05.712 --> 32:07.538
I'm h.I.V. Positive, Charlie.

32:09.110 --> 32:10.948
I'm sorry. I should've
told you sooner.

32:13.647 --> 32:14.913
Are you angry at me?

32:16.208 --> 32:18.196
Anger is the last
thing I feel for you.

32:20.108 --> 32:20.808
Saul...

32:24.283 --> 32:25.632
It's not that I'm afraid

32:25.633 --> 32:27.645
that if I kiss you, I'll get sick.

32:29.321 --> 32:31.469
I lived with a man for 20 years.

32:32.170 --> 32:34.369
And for the last ten,

32:35.183 --> 32:35.969
he was...

32:37.994 --> 32:39.382
Struggling with a.I.D.S.

32:39.989 --> 32:43.065
I was with him every
day till he died.

32:45.478 --> 32:47.204
I don't have it in
me to do that again.

32:47.742 --> 32:49.739
Yeah, but my health
has never been better.

32:49.740 --> 32:51.053
I mean, come on.

32:51.446 --> 32:53.871
Cholesterol will get
me before h.I.V. Does.

32:53.872 --> 32:54.839
I know. I know.

32:55.522 --> 32:56.234
But...

32:57.110 --> 32:58.424
I know myself.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.910
I'm not strong enough
to take the risk.

33:06.473 --> 33:07.235
You loved him.

33:11.023 --> 33:11.785
Yes.

33:13.575 --> 33:15.002
Yeah. I'm glad for you.

33:15.003 --> 33:16.452
I'm glad you had
that in your life.

33:18.181 --> 33:21.055
I was beginning to think that
maybe I could have that, too.

33:23.022 --> 33:23.881
I'm sorry.

33:28.060 --> 33:28.871
So am I.

33:33.008 --> 33:33.478
Hey.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.630
Hey. How is she?

33:36.028 --> 33:37.267
Um, she's sleeping...

33:38.315 --> 33:39.091
Which is good.

33:41.303 --> 33:42.890
Did your mom make
it to Cooper's play?

33:43.378 --> 33:44.527
Um, I don't know.

33:45.766 --> 33:46.439
Too bad we missed it.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.778
That's... kind of our play.

33:49.293 --> 33:50.619
"Romeo and Juliet"?

33:54.207 --> 33:57.354
A pair of star-cross'd
lovers take their lives.

33:57.355 --> 33:59.169
Right. Nobody's taking any lives.

34:00.268 --> 34:01.281
We're still here.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.005
We have a chance
to make this right.

34:18.230 --> 34:19.688
My mother's not getting any better

34:19.688 --> 34:21.291
with me being around her.

34:22.188 --> 34:24.001
It's making her worse, actually.

34:28.799 --> 34:32.916
I got a job offer in New York,

34:32.917 --> 34:34.190
taking pictures.

34:39.288 --> 34:40.552
You went away, Justin...

34:42.900 --> 34:43.963
Because you needed to.

34:44.663 --> 34:46.788
And you grew up so much.

34:51.076 --> 34:52.036
I need that now.

34:55.050 --> 34:56.225
This is my chance.

34:58.149 --> 34:59.048
I have to go.

35:03.742 --> 35:05.594
Rebecca, I saw you, um...

35:06.013 --> 35:07.501
With your mother tonight,

35:07.821 --> 35:10.254
trying to make things the
way they were before.

35:10.255 --> 35:11.130
And...

35:13.866 --> 35:15.628
I guess that's what
we were trying to do.

35:18.328 --> 35:18.979
Yeah.

35:22.966 --> 35:24.416
But we can't go backwards.

35:27.465 --> 35:28.502
It's time, Justin.

35:30.252 --> 35:31.090
It's time.

35:33.491 --> 35:34.366
I love you.

35:37.259 --> 35:40.070
I-I wouldn't even be alive
if it wasn't for you.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.396
Are you kidding me?

35:41.397 --> 35:43.831
Do you remember the girl
that I was when we met?

35:43.832 --> 35:45.749
I don't think I would
be here either.

35:51.485 --> 35:53.048
A pair of star-cross'd lovers...

35:55.785 --> 35:57.435
Who saved each other's lives.

36:13.144 --> 36:13.743
Hey.

36:13.956 --> 36:14.519
Hi.

36:15.618 --> 36:16.232
Um...

36:16.516 --> 36:18.052
Rebecca told me she stopped by,

36:18.053 --> 36:19.841
so I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

36:21.428 --> 36:22.141
I'm fine.

36:23.503 --> 36:26.003
I'm good at saying
good-bye to people I love.

36:26.137 --> 36:27.774
I've done a lot of it in my life.

36:28.373 --> 36:30.082
Uh, if you are that good at it,

36:30.083 --> 36:32.049
why are you making enough
peanut butter cookies

36:32.050 --> 36:34.100
to feed the grand
army of the Republic?

36:34.450 --> 36:35.992
Because they're Cooper's favorite,

36:35.993 --> 36:37.905
and I missed his play last night.

36:37.906 --> 36:41.018
I'm not above buying
his forgiveness.

36:42.718 --> 36:43.555
And they...

36:44.505 --> 36:46.117
Keep my mind off of Rebecca

36:46.118 --> 36:47.667
and other things.

36:49.177 --> 36:50.539
Uh, maybe I should help.

36:54.677 --> 36:57.850
Rebecca told me how steady
and strong you've been.

36:57.851 --> 36:59.014
Mom, stop.

37:00.025 --> 37:02.576
Justin, I know you.
You must be dying inside.

37:02.577 --> 37:05.487
Okay, mom, uh, stop, because if I start,
I'm not gonna stop.

37:06.001 --> 37:07.500
Well, then don't stop.

37:12.962 --> 37:14.112
There's no one here but me.

37:22.097 --> 37:23.260
Oh, Justin.

37:26.158 --> 37:27.572
Oh, sweetheart.

37:28.903 --> 37:30.004
Justin.

37:35.202 --> 37:35.988
I know.

37:39.376 --> 37:40.514
I know.

37:41.830 --> 37:42.784
He couldn't handle it, huh?

37:42.785 --> 37:45.690
No, he... he couldn't
even finish his cognac.

37:45.691 --> 37:48.770
Oh, Saul, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, we pushed you into it.

37:48.771 --> 37:51.567
Yeah, practically at gunpoint.
Come on. If you hadn't pushed me,

37:51.568 --> 37:53.728
I'd probably still be standing
at the edge of that cliff,

37:53.729 --> 37:55.047
afraid to jump.

37:55.051 --> 37:57.743
So I jumped, I hit the rocks,

37:57.744 --> 37:59.975
it hurt like hell,
and I'm still standing.

38:00.076 --> 38:01.116
Can I have that stapler, please?

38:01.117 --> 38:03.059
Oh, you don't have to do
the accounts right now.

38:03.060 --> 38:05.190
Take the day off.
Yeah, go swimming at Nora's.

38:05.191 --> 38:05.828
Yeah.

38:05.829 --> 38:09.390
Would you stop? I'm fine.
I'm fi... I'm better than fine.

38:09.740 --> 38:12.153
Look, I realized how
lucky I am, okay?

38:12.673 --> 38:14.174
Charlie's lover died.

38:14.237 --> 38:17.561
I've been symptom free
for probably 30 years,

38:17.562 --> 38:19.385
and we know that
could change, right?

38:19.386 --> 38:21.399
So the next time I'm on
the edge of that cliff,

38:21.400 --> 38:24.360
I'll probably leap even faster.
Just... just keep pushing me.

38:24.862 --> 38:26.774
I could always use a little shove.

38:28.582 --> 38:29.321
Really?

38:31.270 --> 38:31.845
Yeah.

38:32.340 --> 38:34.824
Well, I know this lawyer.

38:34.825 --> 38:36.102
He's about your age...

38:36.103 --> 38:38.377
Kevin, just relax.

38:38.577 --> 38:39.165
Okay.

38:39.748 --> 38:41.286
Oh, not Stanley?

38:42.299 --> 38:43.823
Oh, that's such a good idea.

38:44.248 --> 38:45.210
Who's Stanley?

38:45.373 --> 38:46.684
Uh, I'm gonna be in my office.

38:46.685 --> 38:49.385
Just let me know if you want to
go bungee jumping. Who's Stanley?

38:50.355 --> 38:51.906
Wait. Who's Stanley?

38:53.130 --> 38:53.649
Hey, mom.

38:53.650 --> 38:54.601
Oh, hey, honey.

38:54.602 --> 38:56.849
You're kind of famous
around school right now.

38:56.932 --> 38:59.943
Oh, dear. What are they saying?

38:59.944 --> 39:03.018
Everyone's going around
calling each other "pool boy."

39:04.753 --> 39:08.227
Listen, I'm sorry I pushed you
into a school like Flintwood.

39:08.228 --> 39:11.797
Honestly, if Gloria
pierson-Davenport's mentality

39:11.798 --> 39:13.890
is any indication of
how that school thinks,

39:13.891 --> 39:15.284
I don't want you
going there either.

39:15.285 --> 39:18.947
Like, duh. That place is the
weenie capital of the world.

39:18.966 --> 39:19.780
Hey, Cooper.

39:20.516 --> 39:23.002
It's for you. It's
Margaret Hartley. Juliet?

39:23.003 --> 39:25.602
Mm-hmm. She says she needs help
with her geography homework.

39:25.603 --> 39:29.016
Oh, so now it's geography?
At lunch it was math.

39:29.030 --> 39:31.468
One kiss and I can't
get rid of this girl.

39:32.758 --> 39:35.408
Oh, dear. You've
created a monster.

39:41.110 --> 39:41.885
Sure.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.485
I'm sorry I ran away like that.

39:49.809 --> 39:52.347
You know, I think it comes
from a family where,

39:52.659 --> 39:54.259
if... if you didn't talk, they...

39:55.222 --> 39:56.909
They didn't know you
were there and...

39:57.674 --> 39:59.296
Oh, and then I had
this father who...

39:59.297 --> 40:01.075
Kitty, shh.

40:01.776 --> 40:03.295
Right, right.

40:03.296 --> 40:05.173
It might be impossible.
It might be that I'm incapa...

40:05.174 --> 40:06.974
Shh. It's okay.

40:09.236 --> 40:11.686
And the real reason
that I ran away...

40:12.893 --> 40:14.319
Was because you're right.

40:17.693 --> 40:18.330
I...

40:19.070 --> 40:20.360
I do like you.

40:27.605 --> 40:29.328
Are you sure it's not too soon?

40:29.329 --> 40:31.380
Shh. Shh.

40:47.377 --> 40:48.377
Enough said.
