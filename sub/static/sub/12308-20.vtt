00:02.229 --> 00:03.770
So, how did it go, Sir?

00:03.936 --> 00:05.759
The Genii contact didn't show up.

00:06.412 --> 00:08.157
I can't say I'm surprised.

00:08.277 --> 00:10.860
What are you saying, Major,
the Genii can't be trusted?

00:10.981 --> 00:13.988
Well, they did try and kill you and
Dr. McKay, along with that little girl.

00:14.109 --> 00:17.059
True, true, and normally, that's
the kind of thing I'd take personally,

00:17.180 --> 00:19.757
but Ladon claims
he didn't order the hit.

00:19.877 --> 00:21.732
He's trying to get on our good side.

00:21.852 --> 00:24.193
Do you think they know anything
about where Michael took Teyla?

00:24.316 --> 00:26.618
They've got solid intel,
and we're following up every lead,

00:26.738 --> 00:29.150
- no matter how thin.
- Okay, so, what do you want to do?

00:29.275 --> 00:30.641
Well, I'm gonna go ahead.

00:30.762 --> 00:33.218
You stay behind for a few hours,
tell me if he shows up.

00:33.342 --> 00:34.373
Will do.

00:35.453 --> 00:37.494
We're gonna find her, Major.

00:38.817 --> 00:39.850
Yes, Sir.

Somebody turned up the heat.

00:56.349 --> 00:57.230
Hello?

01:05.829 --> 01:08.560
If this is a surprise party,
it's not my birthday.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.426
This is Sheppard, anyone read?

01:37.315 --> 01:38.428
I repeat,

01:39.650 --> 01:41.982

03:37.749 --> 03:41.896
All right, this is either the most
elaborate practical joke of all time,

03:42.589 --> 03:44.978
or I'm in serious trouble here.

03:47.511 --> 03:49.939
This is Sheppard,
anyone on this frequency?

03:50.093 --> 03:52.376
<i>- Sheppard, is that really you?</i>
- McKay?

03:52.498 --> 03:55.323
<i>- Can't believe it. It actually worked!</i>
- What are you talking about?

03:55.443 --> 03:57.489
- What the hell is going on here?
<i>- I imagine</i>

03:57.651 --> 03:59.284
<i>you're a little confused right now.</i>

03:59.405 --> 04:02.046
<i>God, for you, like, what,
five minutes has passed?</i>

04:02.900 --> 04:05.665
<i>Look, I need you to describe exactly
what you're seeing.</i>

04:05.791 --> 04:08.798
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- In the control room. It's deserted.

04:08.920 --> 04:10.846
<i>- Is there any power?</i>
- No, everything's dead.

04:10.966 --> 04:12.700
<i>Yeah, and did I tell you
the ocean's gone?</i>

04:12.821 --> 04:13.995
<i>Sorry, what?</i>

04:14.259 --> 04:16.749
The big blue thing
out the window, it's gone.

04:16.870 --> 04:19.867
It's a desert, and it's about
120 degrees in here.

04:20.567 --> 04:23.416
<i>Jeez, the planet must've undergone
some serious climate changes.</i>

04:23.536 --> 04:25.812
If you don't start giving me
some answers pretty soon here...

04:25.932 --> 04:28.658
<i>Okay, look, I understand this is hard
for you. Just do me a favor</i>

04:28.780 --> 04:30.386
<i>and go to the hologram room.</i>

04:30.509 --> 04:31.983
- Why?
<i>- Just do it, please.</i>

04:55.309 --> 04:56.473
All right, I'm here.

04:56.595 --> 04:59.324
<i>- Well, activate the hologram projector.</i>
- There's no power

04:59.447 --> 05:03.191
<i>It's connected to an independent
power source. Don't worry, it will work.</i>

05:07.211 --> 05:08.228
Hey there.

05:09.992 --> 05:12.771
- Rodney?
- God, it's good to see you again.

05:13.815 --> 05:15.816
- You're a hologram?
- No...

05:17.057 --> 05:18.107
Of course.

05:18.282 --> 05:20.944
I'm tapped into
the City's internal sensors

05:21.065 --> 05:24.181
so I've got eyes and ears, so to speak.
You look good.

05:25.177 --> 05:26.403
You look...

05:28.088 --> 05:29.102
Different.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.129
That's 'cause you remember me
the way I was.

05:32.251 --> 05:35.444
- What, you mean earlier today?
- Ah, it's funny, you know?

05:35.564 --> 05:37.929
I've spent the last 25 years of my life
trying to make this work

05:38.049 --> 05:40.218
and I never once thought
what I was gonna say to you.

05:40.624 --> 05:43.713
You can start by telling me
what the hell's going on here.

05:43.954 --> 05:45.834
Right, right. Okay...

05:46.923 --> 05:48.402
Remember that mission report,

05:48.559 --> 05:50.273
SG-1 stepped through the Gate,

05:50.393 --> 05:54.215
their wormhole accidentally intersected
with a solar flare

05:54.336 --> 05:56.289
and they were sent back to 1969?

05:57.972 --> 05:59.186
Well, vaguely.

05:59.726 --> 06:02.193
Well, something similar
has just happened to you.

06:02.313 --> 06:03.533
I was sent back in time?

06:04.376 --> 06:07.781
No, in fact, you were sent forward
into the future.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.608
How far into the future?

06:09.771 --> 06:12.197
Interesting question,
and one that was not easy to figure out.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.116
I had to determine
the exact characteristics

06:14.239 --> 06:15.999
of the solar flare in question...

06:16.124 --> 06:18.256
48,000 years, give or take?

06:20.553 --> 06:24.179
- This is a practical joke.
- I'm afraid not. Freak accident. Sorry.

06:24.882 --> 06:29.374
You're telling me I just traveled 48,000
years into the future, in 10 seconds?

06:29.495 --> 06:31.143
It's kinda cool when you think about it.

06:31.306 --> 06:33.651
Surfing a 30-foot wave in Waimea
is cool.

06:33.771 --> 06:35.882
Dating a supermodel is cool.
This is not cool!

06:36.003 --> 06:37.484
All right, calm down.

06:40.054 --> 06:41.447
If I'm in the future,

06:42.429 --> 06:44.073
- that means you're...
- Dead.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.812
Dead and buried, and turned to dust
a long, long time ago,

06:48.147 --> 06:49.870
along with everyone you ever knew.

06:50.448 --> 06:53.376
There's no way of knowing what the state
of human civilization is,

06:53.497 --> 06:55.783
whether it even still exits. I mean,

06:56.038 --> 06:58.161
we've obviously abandoned this City.

06:58.281 --> 06:59.392
Yeah, obviously.

06:59.512 --> 07:01.838
There's not enough power
for you to gate back to Earth,

07:01.958 --> 07:05.252
and without a MALP, going anywhere else
would be far too risky.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.224
It is entirely possible that you are
the last human being alive.

07:09.626 --> 07:11.979
You're not doing a very good job
of cheering me up here.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.323
Oh, consider yourself lucky, young man.

07:14.443 --> 07:16.911
While I was figuring out this plan,

07:17.034 --> 07:19.688
I had no way of knowing whether
the City would even survive this long.

07:19.808 --> 07:20.670
What plan?

07:20.790 --> 07:24.093
I took advantage of some progress
in hologram technology

07:24.213 --> 07:26.494
to create this simulation.

07:27.775 --> 07:30.155
I'm able to move anywhere
inside the City.

07:30.275 --> 07:33.924
I'm fully interactive, and I'm designed
to mimic the exact response

07:34.044 --> 07:36.126
and appearance
of the great Dr. Rodney McKay.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.509
Couldn't use anyone else, huh?

07:40.044 --> 07:40.888
Funny.

07:42.139 --> 07:44.344
I'm linked to the City's main systems,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.381
but I have an independent core drive,

07:46.501 --> 07:48.909
which is sealed in the foundation
of one of the outer buildings,

07:49.029 --> 07:51.579
along with a Mark-12 naquadah generator

07:51.699 --> 07:54.527
and a couple of other,
well, key components.

07:54.647 --> 07:55.900
It's kind of like a...

07:56.020 --> 07:58.302
well, what would you say...
like a time capsule, so to speak.

07:58.422 --> 08:00.128
It's really nice to have company,

08:00.248 --> 08:02.569
but if what you're saying is true,
what good does it do me?

08:03.051 --> 08:05.324
Oh, trust me,
I wouldn't go to all this trouble

08:05.444 --> 08:07.571
just so we could have a chat.

08:08.118 --> 08:10.243
No, I'm... I'm here to bring you back.

08:11.310 --> 08:12.364
Come along.

08:14.687 --> 08:16.839
<i>- Where are we going?
- Stasis chamber.</i>

08:16.959 --> 08:18.957
<i>- Why?
- Buy some time.</i>

08:19.521 --> 08:21.505
Oh, that really explains everything.

08:21.625 --> 08:24.819
Theoretically, we can send you back
exactly the way you got here,

08:24.939 --> 08:28.210
using the Gate, the right address,
and a solar flare.

08:28.813 --> 08:31.076
Only problem is, we're waiting
for something very specific,

08:31.196 --> 08:33.964
a prominence with exactly
the right shape, size,

08:34.083 --> 08:36.818
characteristics, and relative
position in space

08:36.938 --> 08:39.154
so that it will interact
with the wormhole

08:39.274 --> 08:40.919
in exactly the right manner,

08:41.039 --> 08:43.881
and send you back exactly the right
amount of time.

08:44.001 --> 08:46.014
- And that doesn't happen every day.
- Exactly.

08:46.134 --> 08:49.872
- How long are we talking about?
- 700, 800 years, 1000 tops.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.370
That's your plan?

08:52.613 --> 08:55.453
I'm 48,000 years into the future,
and you want to put me on ice

08:55.573 --> 08:57.290
- for another thousand?
- Tops.

08:58.123 --> 08:59.349
We need to be precise.

08:59.469 --> 09:02.255
If I don't get you back within
two months of the moment you left, then

09:02.375 --> 09:03.696
it'll be too late.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.258
Too late?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

09:09.186 --> 09:12.889
Things didn't exactly go well for us
after your disappearance.

09:13.838 --> 09:15.750
Once I figured out what happened to you,

09:15.870 --> 09:18.239
I realized there was
nothing we could do.

09:18.699 --> 09:20.438
The air force pronounced you KIA,

09:20.803 --> 09:24.025
and they gave you a very nice
military funeral back on Earth.

09:24.145 --> 09:25.691
Obviously, the casket was empty,

09:25.811 --> 09:28.279
but, you know, it's the thought
that counts.

09:29.001 --> 09:29.906
From there...

09:32.702 --> 09:35.090
From there,
things went from bad to worse.

09:37.388 --> 09:39.581
<i>We kept searching for Teyla, but</i>

09:39.743 --> 09:42.780
<i>we just didn't have the resources
to cover enough ground.</i>

09:48.287 --> 09:50.940
<i>It took us two months
before we finally found her</i>

09:51.060 --> 09:53.098
<i>in one of Michael's hideouts,</i>

09:55.551 --> 09:57.249
<i>but by then it was too late.</i>

09:58.783 --> 10:00.199
She'd had the baby.

10:01.787 --> 10:02.743
I guess,

10:03.359 --> 10:04.450
after that...

10:05.101 --> 10:07.319
he didn't have any use for her anymore,

10:08.637 --> 10:10.030
so he killed her.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.063
It's not your fault.

10:17.183 --> 10:18.831
I should have been there.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.047
And you will be,

10:20.167 --> 10:22.996
and knowing the address
where we eventually found Teyla,

10:23.116 --> 10:25.182
you will be able
to get there much quicker.

10:25.302 --> 10:28.999
You know, save Teyla, save the baby,
change the fate of the galaxy.

10:29.197 --> 10:30.220
What do you mean?

10:30.340 --> 10:33.641
It was the turning point, the key to
everything. Once Michael had that baby,

10:33.761 --> 10:36.710
he was able to complete his research
and perfect the hybrids.

10:36.830 --> 10:39.726
After that, well, he really
kicked things into gear.

10:42.226 --> 10:46.392
<i>He stepped up his campaign of exposing
human populations to the Hoffan drug.</i>

10:46.512 --> 10:49.144
<i>Jennifer did her best to find a way
to combat the effects,</i>

10:49.264 --> 10:52.113
<i>trying to lower the mortality rate,
but ultimately,</i>

10:52.886 --> 10:54.402
<i>it was a losing battle.</i>

11:00.431 --> 11:01.964
<i>With their food supplies tainted,</i>

11:02.084 --> 11:04.626
<i>the infighting between
the Wraith factions got worse.</i>

11:04.787 --> 11:06.920
<i>Michael waited until they were
at each other's throats,</i>

11:07.890 --> 11:09.584
<i>and then he made his move.</i>

11:11.185 --> 11:12.058
Status.

11:12.436 --> 11:14.393
Both hives are heavily damaged.

11:14.513 --> 11:17.994
They've lost hyperdrive
and they're venting atmosphere.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.365
Well then, let's finish it.

11:30.977 --> 11:34.524
<i>He took advantage of their weakened
state and their internal divisions,</i>

11:34.976 --> 11:38.820
<i>and in less than a year,
he had the Wraith on their knees.</i>

11:39.900 --> 11:40.852
<i>Literally.</i>

11:48.872 --> 11:50.507
You know, the irony is,

11:52.812 --> 11:55.100
I never asked for any of this.

11:58.544 --> 12:00.670
I was taken prisoner by the humans,

12:01.822 --> 12:02.601
tortured,

12:03.467 --> 12:04.752
experimented on,

12:05.228 --> 12:08.316
and when I finally escaped
and returned to my Wraith brothers,

12:08.436 --> 12:10.548
<i>instead of being welcomed back,</i>

12:11.479 --> 12:12.777
I was met with scorn.

12:13.136 --> 12:14.529
You will pay for this.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.699
You still have your pride.

12:20.483 --> 12:21.763
Good for you.

13:05.866 --> 13:07.577
With the Wraith in disarray,

13:07.697 --> 13:11.493
Michael returned to the humans
he'd infected with the Hoffan drug.

13:11.613 --> 13:14.407
He selected the strongest
and the healthiest of the survivors

13:14.736 --> 13:16.556
and converted them to hybrids.

13:16.676 --> 13:18.455
The rest he exterminated.

13:18.575 --> 13:21.292
You think by saving Teyla,
we can change all this.

13:21.412 --> 13:24.785
I know it. All I have to do is
get you safely to a stasis chamber,

13:25.115 --> 13:27.145
I will reprogram the sensors...

13:30.274 --> 13:32.660
- That could be a problem.
- No, no, that's not a problem.

13:32.780 --> 13:35.035
We'll just find another way around.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.282
There is no other way around.

13:45.854 --> 13:48.218
The sand has penetrated
the lower levels.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.884
48,000 years into the future,

13:51.004 --> 13:53.510
you've still got a knack
for stating the obvious.

13:54.452 --> 13:56.134
All right, what do we do?

13:56.640 --> 13:59.460
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

13:59.580 --> 14:01.397
Well, I wasn't programmed
for this variable.

14:01.517 --> 14:03.697
You said you had 25 years
to work on this plan.

14:03.817 --> 14:07.284
Well, McKay did, and he brilliantly
anticipated a lot of potential problems.

14:07.404 --> 14:08.910
It's just that, well,

14:09.340 --> 14:10.942
this wasn't one of them.

14:11.282 --> 14:12.289
All right,

14:12.898 --> 14:15.143
go up two levels turn right,
there's an outer door.

14:15.263 --> 14:17.150
It's only a quarter of a mile
across the plaza.

14:17.270 --> 14:19.070
<i>- You can't do that.</i>
- Why not?

14:19.429 --> 14:21.473
Not only is it extremely hot out there,

14:21.593 --> 14:24.218
but for the last half an hour, the
barometric pressure has been dropping,

14:24.338 --> 14:26.278
<i>and the wind speeds
have increased significantly.</i>

14:26.398 --> 14:28.342
- Storm's coming.
- A sandstorm.

14:28.530 --> 14:30.864
- You ever been in one of those?
- As a matter of fact, I have.

14:33.212 --> 14:34.722
Oh! Then you know what that means.

14:34.842 --> 14:37.348
It's not like we have
a lot of options here.

14:51.378 --> 14:52.909
That sounds pretty nasty out there.

14:53.029 --> 14:56.284
The winds are gusting
over 50 miles an hour and increasing.

14:56.404 --> 14:59.307
The visibility's basically zero.
You can't go out there.

14:59.427 --> 15:01.724
- You're just gonna have to wait it out.
- For how long?

15:01.844 --> 15:04.350
Well, I don't know,
maybe a couple of hours.

15:08.780 --> 15:11.052
Are you hungry? Do you have any food?

15:13.818 --> 15:17.447
I suppose it doesn't really matter.
We'll wait for the storm to blow over

15:17.567 --> 15:19.986
and have you out of here
in no time at all.

15:20.421 --> 15:23.188
Well, you'll actually be here
for 700 years, but...

15:23.308 --> 15:24.845
<i>you know what I mean.</i>

15:25.594 --> 15:26.887
What about everyone else?

15:27.922 --> 15:30.725
<i>I mean, you told me about Teyla,
but what about the rest of them?</i>

15:30.845 --> 15:34.354
No way we would've rolled over and
let Michael take over the whole galaxy.

15:35.779 --> 15:36.492
No.

15:38.566 --> 15:40.021
Well, what happened?

15:40.740 --> 15:44.653
The IOA and the military were reluctant
to commit a lot of resources

15:44.773 --> 15:47.778
to protecting the human populations
of another galaxy,

15:48.743 --> 15:49.773
but Sam...

15:50.987 --> 15:53.194
Sam wouldn't take no for an answer.

15:55.138 --> 15:57.337
<i>Finally, they decided
to give her a new ship,</i>

15:57.457 --> 15:58.504
<i>the Phoenix.</i>

16:02.408 --> 16:04.029
<i>It was barely off the assembly line.</i>

16:04.149 --> 16:06.289
<i>Half the Asgard systems
weren't finished, the other half</i>

16:06.409 --> 16:07.672
<i>weren't working.</i>

16:12.432 --> 16:15.103
<i>We spent the better part of a month
getting her ready for combat.</i>

16:15.713 --> 16:17.936
<i>We worked day and night, side by side.</i>

16:18.280 --> 16:21.538
<i>Zelenka might have been there as well,
I don't really remember.</i>

16:22.030 --> 16:24.920
<i>I do remember never feeling so drained</i>

16:25.040 --> 16:26.396
<i>in my entire life.</i>

16:35.059 --> 16:36.344
<i>Eventually, though,</i>

16:36.467 --> 16:38.913
<i>we managed to get her in working order.</i>

16:43.637 --> 16:45.725
All right, everything checks out.

16:45.845 --> 16:47.910
Weapons, shields, long-range sensors,

16:48.030 --> 16:49.638
all in the green. She's good to go.

16:50.030 --> 16:51.231
Great work, Rodney.

16:51.351 --> 16:52.969
Now I want you, Radek, and your team

16:53.089 --> 16:55.292
to head back to Atlantis
and take a couple of days off.

16:55.412 --> 16:57.769
When you're good and rested,
get to work on the City's shields.

16:57.889 --> 17:00.266
Do anything you can
to maximize efficiency.

17:00.386 --> 17:01.661
You're gonna need them.

17:01.781 --> 17:04.003
- Well, what about you?
- I'm gonna take her out.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.315
For the time being,
Major Lorne is in command of Atlantis.

17:06.435 --> 17:08.469
Take some time.
You're as exhausted as we are.

17:08.589 --> 17:11.796
Intel suggests that Michael's about
to move against several human worlds.

17:11.915 --> 17:14.412
- We have to get out there now.
- So let someone else go.

17:16.593 --> 17:17.374
Right.

17:18.718 --> 17:19.592
Hey...

17:23.003 --> 17:23.964
Good luck?

17:26.343 --> 17:27.595
Thanks, Rodney.

17:31.407 --> 17:32.724
For everything.

17:45.622 --> 17:49.114
<i>They started a series of hit and run
ops, real guerrilla style.</i>

17:58.488 --> 18:00.968
- One of the hives has been neutralized.
- What about the other one?

18:01.088 --> 18:02.793
Minimal damage.
They're powering weapons.

18:02.913 --> 18:04.906
Should we swing around for another pass?

18:05.026 --> 18:06.881
Forget it. Get us out of here.

18:12.754 --> 18:16.599
For a while, it really worked. They were
able to inflict considerable damage

18:16.719 --> 18:18.495
despite terrible odds,

18:19.419 --> 18:21.187
but, eventually, their luck ran out.

18:23.872 --> 18:25.842
<i>Michael deliberately leaked some intel</i>

18:25.962 --> 18:29.197
<i>that he was about to attack
a heavily-populated human world.</i>

18:30.061 --> 18:32.399
<i>Sam thought she could get there first,</i>

18:33.662 --> 18:35.117
<i>but she was wrong.</i>

18:40.992 --> 18:43.405
- We've got a hive ship, 6:00.
- It's an ambush.

18:44.102 --> 18:46.504
- Here comes another one, dead ahead.
- Evasive maneuvers!

18:58.208 --> 18:59.976
- We're boxed in.
- Return fire!

19:05.611 --> 19:07.078
We've lost Asgard weapons!

19:07.216 --> 19:09.160
Switch to missiles, fire all batteries!

19:09.280 --> 19:10.499
Help him. Go.

19:19.177 --> 19:20.956
We've got an overload,
it's the hyperdrive!

19:21.552 --> 19:22.973
Reroute the power!

19:23.093 --> 19:25.363
No response. System is going critical.

19:27.088 --> 19:29.723
I'm beaming you to the planet.
Head to the Gate as soon as you can.

19:29.843 --> 19:32.133
- What about you?
- I'll be right behind you.

19:46.683 --> 19:49.651
<i>After she got the crew off,
she must have lost the transport system.</i>

19:49.771 --> 19:51.963
<i>With her engines about to go critical,
I guess she figured</i>

19:52.083 --> 19:54.197
<i>she didn't have anything to lose.</i>

20:11.781 --> 20:15.260
<i>With her last breath, she took out
three of Michael's hive ships,</i>

20:16.452 --> 20:18.553
and we buried another empty casket.

20:39.352 --> 20:41.498
- Where the hell have you been?
- I was inputting our...

20:41.618 --> 20:43.747
new solar flare
requirements to the long-range sensors,

20:44.703 --> 20:47.125
and I found out
what happened to the ocean.

20:47.932 --> 20:49.711
You gonna tell me, or keep it a secret? 

20:49.871 --> 20:52.167
The sun in this system is dying.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.442
- It's running out of fuel.
- Wouldn't that make it colder?

20:55.562 --> 20:59.142
No. As it consumes the heavier elements,
it begins to expand.

20:59.419 --> 21:01.264
It's basically turning into a red giant.

21:01.620 --> 21:03.372
Okay, so mystery solved. Let's move on.

21:03.492 --> 21:05.242
No, no, you don't get it.

21:05.362 --> 21:07.935
This isn't some kind of
cyclical climate change,

21:08.055 --> 21:09.930
this is a one-way ticket.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.059
This planet is going to get
hotter and hotter.

21:13.179 --> 21:15.828
Eventually, the atmosphere
is gonna burn off.

21:16.121 --> 21:18.497
- How long before that happens?
- It is impossible to say,

21:18.617 --> 21:21.504
but my best estimate is under 500 years.

21:21.624 --> 21:23.619
You said I'd be in stasis
for at least 700.

21:23.780 --> 21:24.637
Right.

21:25.137 --> 21:28.416
So the moment you step out of
the stasis chamber, you'll be killed.

21:31.621 --> 21:35.017
- You gotta think of something.
- I am trying. It's like I said...

21:35.137 --> 21:37.787
You didn't anticipate the variable.
I get it.

21:39.661 --> 21:42.478
All right, can the Mark-12
power the shields?

21:42.598 --> 21:45.808
Theoretically, but there would never be
enough power left over to maintain

21:45.970 --> 21:49.076
my systems, the long-range sensors,
the stasis chamber...

21:49.725 --> 21:51.978
The City has solar
power generators, right?

21:52.098 --> 21:53.959
Yes, which would come in very handy

21:54.079 --> 21:56.569
if we were trying to power
a couple of electric golf carts.

21:56.689 --> 21:59.531
- You're thinking like the old McKay.
<i>- I can't really help that.</i>

21:59.907 --> 22:02.888
- Look, what are you saying?
- The sun's going red giant, right?

22:03.008 --> 22:04.541
Increased solar energy.

22:04.661 --> 22:07.284
The worse it gets,
the more power we'll have.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.604
Oh, my God, that could work.

22:09.724 --> 22:12.354
We use the shields
to protect the atmosphere.

22:12.474 --> 22:13.381
Exactly.

22:13.501 --> 22:16.131
We couldn't do it indefinitely,
but it would buy us 100 years or so.

22:16.538 --> 22:18.758
It's gonna have to do for now.
Open up the door.

22:19.460 --> 22:21.759
- What about the storm?
- It's been going on for seven hours.

22:21.879 --> 22:24.139
- It could go on for days.
- It'll be dark soon.

22:24.554 --> 22:27.316
All the more reason to get going. All
I got to do is walk in a straight line.

22:27.436 --> 22:31.479
- It might not be as easy as you think.
- Never said I thought it would be easy.

22:31.599 --> 22:33.657
Look, I haven't eaten.

22:33.777 --> 22:37.291
I was hungry on my way back to Atlantis.
The longer we wait, the weaker I get.

22:37.411 --> 22:39.696
All right. Look, I can't go outside,

22:40.092 --> 22:42.819
but I can stay in contact with you
over the radio.

22:48.358 --> 22:49.472
Like you said!

22:49.786 --> 22:52.104
Just keep walking in a straight line!

22:52.535 --> 22:55.046
You'll hit the building
on the other side!

22:55.166 --> 22:56.835
Then feel your way to the door!

22:56.975 --> 22:59.007
I'll be waiting for you there!

23:10.549 --> 23:13.240
- Sheppard, can you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you!

23:16.135 --> 23:18.225
- How you doing?
- Never better!

23:29.534 --> 23:31.105
Yeah, I'm still here.

23:31.225 --> 23:32.833
<i>Tell me about Ronon.</i>

23:33.661 --> 23:34.826
What, now?

23:35.161 --> 23:36.241
<i>Yes, now!</i>

23:36.536 --> 23:37.918
<i>Talk to me, Rodney.</i>

23:38.038 --> 23:38.947
Right...

23:40.161 --> 23:41.013
Well...

23:41.645 --> 23:43.952
after what happened to you and...

23:44.072 --> 23:45.283
and then Teyla,

23:46.217 --> 23:49.115
I guess he didn't feel comfortable
on the base anymore.

23:49.913 --> 23:53.506
<i>He persuaded Sam to let him go off-world
and recruit a strike force.</i>

23:54.162 --> 23:56.416
<i>By this time, the galaxy was in a panic.</i>

23:56.536 --> 23:59.985
<i>Word was spreading that Michael's agenda
was to wipe out Wraith and human alike.</i>

24:01.099 --> 24:03.866
<i>Ronon didn't have much trouble
finding volunteers.</i>

24:09.204 --> 24:09.937
One!

24:11.632 --> 24:12.372
Two!

24:12.532 --> 24:15.655
<i>They were just simple villagers,
with no military experience,</i>

24:15.775 --> 24:18.370
<i>but he trained them
in all forms of combat.</i>

24:18.660 --> 24:21.224
<i>He even convinced Sam to let them
have some of our equipment.</i>

24:21.344 --> 24:23.473
<i>Radios, explosives, P-90s.</i>

24:23.847 --> 24:27.028
<i>It wasn't long before he had himself
a pretty effective combat force.</i>

24:30.412 --> 24:33.184
<i>They ran a few successful ops against
some of Michael's ground facilities,</i>

24:33.304 --> 24:34.854
<i>and then one day,</i>

24:36.221 --> 24:38.147
<i>they got a key piece of intel.</i>

24:41.258 --> 24:43.277
<i>Michael had taken over a Wraith lab
and was using it</i>

24:43.439 --> 24:45.280
<i>to create more of his hybrids.</i>

24:46.660 --> 24:48.519
<i>They decided to take it out.</i>

24:52.910 --> 24:55.576
<i>That's when they ran into someone...</i>

24:55.696 --> 24:56.863
<i>unexpected...</i>

24:57.478 --> 25:00.587
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I suspect the same as you.

25:00.908 --> 25:03.219
Michael is using this facility
to create more of his soldiers.

25:03.339 --> 25:04.883
I intend to destroy it.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.100
By yourself?

25:06.220 --> 25:09.226
There is something to be said
for stealth over brute force.

25:09.346 --> 25:10.346
<i>Ronon, come in.</i>

25:11.598 --> 25:12.598
Go ahead.

25:12.723 --> 25:15.971
<i>One of the guards must have got a signal
off, because a cruiser just landed.</i>

25:16.091 --> 25:18.603
<i>- We're about to be overrun.</i>
- As I was saying...

25:18.723 --> 25:20.058
We have to abort.

25:21.722 --> 25:23.006
Give me the C-4.

25:23.848 --> 25:26.790
Take the men back, meet up with second
squad, and then head for the Gate.

25:26.910 --> 25:28.323
<i>Signal me when you get there.</i>

25:29.348 --> 25:30.070
Go!

25:31.160 --> 25:33.036
You intend to complete your mission?

25:33.488 --> 25:34.533
You're damn right.

25:34.909 --> 25:35.872
As do I.

25:36.598 --> 25:38.583
I was going to write
an elaborate program

25:38.743 --> 25:41.002
designed to slowly create a fatal error

25:41.162 --> 25:42.830
in the primary capacitor,

25:43.161 --> 25:45.924
but I doubt there will be time
for that now.

25:46.084 --> 25:47.987
I was just gonna blow it up.

25:48.598 --> 25:49.598
Naturally.

26:14.321 --> 26:15.370
Force of habit.

26:15.981 --> 26:17.004
Indeed.

26:23.803 --> 26:26.045
This is it. If we detonate in here,

26:26.468 --> 26:29.725
the secondary explosions will certainly
take out the entire facility.

26:29.845 --> 26:30.845
All right.

26:31.345 --> 26:34.058
- You know another way out of here?
- Follow me.

26:37.302 --> 26:38.344
Fall back!

26:39.510 --> 26:40.852
They're in here!

26:40.972 --> 26:43.898
I suggest you detonate now
while we still have a chance.

26:44.058 --> 26:45.918
We wait for my people to clear, period.

26:46.038 --> 26:46.842
Very well.

26:52.646 --> 26:55.118
- We can't hold them off forever.
- Just keep firing.

26:58.315 --> 27:00.036
<i>Ronon, we've reached the Gate.</i>

27:00.156 --> 27:02.057
All right, I want you to head back now,

27:02.177 --> 27:03.834
<i>no questions asked, is that understood?</i>

27:03.995 --> 27:05.042
<i>Understood.</i>

27:08.866 --> 27:09.758
Are we done?

27:13.949 --> 27:14.750
Yeah.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.106
I'm sorry. I...

27:24.530 --> 27:27.477
I wish some of these stories
had happier endings.

27:33.380 --> 27:35.467
Sheppard, are you still with me?

27:44.530 --> 27:46.962
You're bio-signature's
barely registering!

27:52.394 --> 27:53.502
Oh, God...

28:06.176 --> 28:08.798
<i>There you go, you can do it.</i>

28:15.783 --> 28:18.848
I'm still here.
Look, I'd help you up, but, I'm...

28:19.661 --> 28:21.703
- How long was I out?
- All night.

28:22.109 --> 28:24.157
You don't look good.
We should get you to the chamber

28:24.417 --> 28:26.368
<i>- as soon as possible.</i>
- Agreed.

28:26.765 --> 28:30.155
I've already prepped the solar panels.
You're good to go.

28:33.589 --> 28:34.663
Here.

28:36.330 --> 28:37.984
Take the first crystal.

28:38.507 --> 28:42.640
I've loaded all the intel we got
on Michael after your disappearance,

28:42.800 --> 28:45.095
including the address
where we found Teyla.

28:49.948 --> 28:52.951
You know, you never told me
what happened to you.

28:53.227 --> 28:54.312
I mean, in the past.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.982
Oh, you don't want to hear about that.

28:57.690 --> 28:59.354
Why not? Obviously, you survived.

28:59.514 --> 29:01.444
- Only because I quit.
- Quit what?

29:01.704 --> 29:03.738
Atlantis, Stargate Command,
the whole thing.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.596
- Well, that doesn't sound like you.
- Yeah.

29:07.885 --> 29:08.896
Well,

29:09.056 --> 29:10.954
we were under new management.

29:12.264 --> 29:15.169
<i>I was down in the infirmary,
having suffered a...</i>

29:15.329 --> 29:16.920
<i>well, a pretty serious injury.</i>

29:17.080 --> 29:18.418
It's a splinter.

29:18.777 --> 29:20.953
That doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

29:21.507 --> 29:23.786
All right. It's just,

29:24.116 --> 29:26.845
you've kinda come at a bad time.
It's a little busy in here right now.

29:27.501 --> 29:28.691
Yeah, I can see that.

29:28.851 --> 29:30.766
<i>Dr. Keller, Dr. Mckay...</i>

29:31.992 --> 29:33.246
Mr. Woolsey.

29:34.541 --> 29:37.772
I understand you managed to get yourself
appointed our new commander.

29:38.264 --> 29:39.432
That's right.

29:40.078 --> 29:43.125
I only wish it were
under better circumstances.

29:43.997 --> 29:45.989
May I ask what's going on here?

29:46.249 --> 29:49.159
We're organizing some medical supplies
for one of our off-world refugee camps.

29:49.702 --> 29:51.870
I see.
I'm going to have to ask you to stop.

29:52.889 --> 29:56.061
- I'm sorry?
- The IOA is initiating a new policy.

29:56.364 --> 29:59.056
Immediate recall of all base personnel.

29:59.216 --> 30:02.505
From now on, we'll be focusing entirely
on the defense of this City.

30:02.829 --> 30:05.550
Furthermore, Doctor,
your department is gonna be scaled back.

30:06.199 --> 30:07.719
<i>Without the Gate bridge and</i>

30:07.979 --> 30:11.331
with the need to keep at least one ship
in orbit for defensive purposes,

30:11.491 --> 30:14.684
resupply is going to be difficult.
We need to prioritize.

30:15.102 --> 30:17.771
I don't understand this.
I'm already understaffed as it is.

30:18.031 --> 30:20.941
Because you've overextended yourself
with all these humanitarian efforts,

30:21.579 --> 30:24.486
<i>and your continued attempts
to find an antidote for the Hoffan drug.</i>

30:24.746 --> 30:26.850
Once you have refocused
your attention back

30:27.010 --> 30:30.223
to the medical needs of this base
and its personnel,

30:30.543 --> 30:32.285
I don't think you'll have a problem.

30:32.545 --> 30:35.544
Wait a second,
people are dying out there.

30:37.704 --> 30:38.704
I know,

30:39.191 --> 30:40.874
and believe me, if I thought

30:41.034 --> 30:44.047
there was anything I could do about it,
I would.

30:45.042 --> 30:46.258
What about Michael?

30:46.518 --> 30:49.981
Michael knows the defensive capabilities
of this base and our ships.

30:50.192 --> 30:54.095
The IOA thinks it's highly unlikely
he will launch an unprovoked attack.

30:54.255 --> 30:55.183
<i>So that's it?</i>

30:55.443 --> 30:57.894
We're supposed to just stand back
and let him take over the Galaxy?

30:58.761 --> 31:01.930
How many more of our own people
have to die, Doctor?

31:03.618 --> 31:07.487
Colonel Sheppard, Colonel Carter,
Ronon, Teyla, they were your friends.

31:07.828 --> 31:09.364
Sheppard is not dead.

31:09.789 --> 31:10.717
Right.

31:10.877 --> 31:14.832
He's just been transported 48,000 years
into the future.

31:16.529 --> 31:19.312
I guess that makes him
one of the lucky ones.

31:27.056 --> 31:29.028
<i>The idea of standing by
and doing nothing</i>

31:29.188 --> 31:31.290
<i>while the rest of the galaxy
was suffering</i>

31:31.450 --> 31:33.531
<i>was too much for Jennifer to take.</i>

31:36.099 --> 31:37.559
<i>The more I thought about it,</i>

31:37.819 --> 31:40.163
<i>the more I realized she was right.</i>

31:41.224 --> 31:43.236
If you've come here to try
and convince me to stay,

31:43.396 --> 31:45.025
you're wasting your time.

31:45.703 --> 31:47.599
- I already made up my mind.
- No.

31:47.759 --> 31:50.405
I've come here to tell you
I'm leaving, too.

31:54.150 --> 31:56.919
<i>We had three weeks on the Daedalus
with nothing else to think about</i>

31:57.079 --> 31:59.123
<i>but everything that had happened.</i>

31:59.488 --> 32:01.532
<i>We went over it a thousand times,
trying to imagine</i>

32:01.692 --> 32:04.820
<i>what we might have done differently.
It was awful.</i>

32:08.250 --> 32:09.633
<i>At least we had each other.</i>

32:11.013 --> 32:13.609
<i>By the time
we got back to Earth, well...</i>

32:14.829 --> 32:17.205
<i>We weren't just colleagues anymore.</i>

32:24.949 --> 32:27.359
Wait a minute, you and Keller?

32:27.619 --> 32:29.152
Why do you find that so surprising?

32:29.412 --> 32:32.581
I'm just saying, if we start monkeying
with this timeline here,

32:32.798 --> 32:34.991
there's no guarantee
it's gonna turn out the same.

32:35.251 --> 32:36.576
That's what I'm counting on.

32:36.836 --> 32:38.995
You survived, you got the girl,
doesn't sound bad.

32:39.341 --> 32:40.341
No...

32:40.842 --> 32:42.624
No, at first, it was great.

32:43.278 --> 32:46.025
<i>I got a high-paying job
with an aerospace engineering firm.</i>

32:46.185 --> 32:48.296
<i>Jennifer started her own practice.</i>

32:48.556 --> 32:51.284
<i>Things were just starting
to come together.</i>

33:01.423 --> 33:04.276
<i>We should've known
we wouldn't get off so easy.</i>

33:07.307 --> 33:10.370
I'm sorry to say,
but all her internal organs are failing.

33:10.530 --> 33:14.558
<i>Of course, no regular doctor
could diagnose what was wrong with her.</i>

33:14.718 --> 33:18.671
<i>We wound up back at Stargate Command,
less than a year after we'd left.</i>

33:19.842 --> 33:23.313
<i>Complications due to repeated exposure
to the Hoffan drug.</i>

33:23.837 --> 33:24.953
<i>No cure.</i>

33:36.593 --> 33:38.493
<i>I thought I was gonna lose my mind.</i>

33:38.653 --> 33:40.433
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

33:40.593 --> 33:44.613
<i>After everything we'd been through,
to have this happen, it was too much.</i>

33:49.229 --> 33:51.185
<i>And that's when I had my idea.</i>

34:00.119 --> 34:02.182
- Where have you been?
- I've been working.

34:02.342 --> 34:05.271
- Working? On what?
- The solution, to everything.

34:05.431 --> 34:06.708
You, this, all of this.

34:06.968 --> 34:09.811
I mean, Atlantis, Pegasus,
Michael, everything.

34:10.654 --> 34:13.493
- What are you talking about?
- I'm gonna change the timeline.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.241
I'm gonna make it so none ever happened.
I mean, you won't get sick,

34:16.400 --> 34:19.054
Teyla won't die, Michael won't complete
his research, none of it.

34:19.313 --> 34:21.889
- Oh, Rodney...
- I already worked out the basic plan.

34:22.150 --> 34:25.518
Details will be a bit more complicated.
I'll have to create a new form of math

34:25.777 --> 34:27.664
to do the calculations,
but I know I can do it.

34:27.824 --> 34:29.413
What's done is done.

34:31.467 --> 34:32.817
You can't change the past.

34:33.077 --> 34:36.112
You can. I can, and I'm going to,
even if it takes the rest of my life.

34:40.658 --> 34:42.683
You think that's what I want?

34:43.405 --> 34:44.652
Well, why not?

34:48.014 --> 34:50.384
The year I spent in Atlantis, I...

34:52.464 --> 34:56.395
I saw more things
than people even dream about

34:56.554 --> 34:58.098
in their lifetime.

35:02.327 --> 35:04.904
- I don't have any regrets.
- Well, I do.

35:05.778 --> 35:07.602
I've got a whole boat-load of them,

35:07.862 --> 35:10.249
- and I want to do something about it.
- No.

35:10.902 --> 35:12.107
<i>Just promise me</i>

35:12.367 --> 35:15.623
that you're not gonna waste
the rest of your life chasing

35:15.783 --> 35:17.696
after something that's already gone.

35:19.488 --> 35:21.307
<i>But I couldn't let it go.</i>

35:23.938 --> 35:26.143
<i>She died three days later.</i>

35:30.404 --> 35:31.824
<i>I quit the research firm,</i>

35:31.984 --> 35:35.306
<i>took a job teaching physics
at a local community college.</i>

35:35.466 --> 35:36.729
<i>Not much money,</i>

35:36.889 --> 35:39.107
<i>but it gave me the free time I needed.</i>

35:44.441 --> 35:46.880
<i>I'll admit it wasn't much of a life.</i>

35:48.340 --> 35:51.636
<i>Jeanie came by every once in a while
to check up on me.</i>

35:52.782 --> 35:55.640
<i>When she realized she wasn't
gonna be able to convince me to stop,</i>

35:55.800 --> 35:58.236
<i>she decided to pitch in
and help me with the calculations.</i>

36:03.790 --> 36:07.012
<i>But eventually, even she got fed up.</i>

36:07.453 --> 36:08.496
<i>I never wavered.</i>

36:12.891 --> 36:16.269
<i>Years went by. 25 years to be exact...</i>

36:21.405 --> 36:23.103
<i>And suddenly, I had it.</i>

36:25.466 --> 36:27.254
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

36:27.414 --> 36:29.481
<i>I needed to get back to Atlantis.</i>

36:30.527 --> 36:33.642
<i>I didn't have a lot of friends
at Stargate Command,</i>

36:34.496 --> 36:36.067
<i>but I only needed one.</i>

36:36.339 --> 36:38.526
Dr. McKay, good to see you.

36:38.786 --> 36:41.487
- General Lorne.
- Come on in, have a seat.

36:44.905 --> 36:45.839
I...

36:46.776 --> 36:48.180
I read your proposal.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.618
You didn't tell anyone else, did you?

36:50.778 --> 36:52.874
I'm not quite as stupid
as you might think, Doc,

36:53.903 --> 36:55.418
but I'm sorry,

36:56.049 --> 36:58.370
there's just no way I'd ever be able
to get this authorized.

36:58.530 --> 37:01.466
Well, then don't.
You don't have to tell them what it is.

37:01.726 --> 37:04.459
<i>Tell them it's a research project.
Tell them whatever the hell you want.</i>

37:04.619 --> 37:05.625
Rodney...

37:06.755 --> 37:08.848
You're talking about
altering the timeline here.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.415
<i>Changing history. Changing everything.</i>

37:13.154 --> 37:15.772
Do you really think that either of us
has the right to make that call?

37:16.032 --> 37:17.688
Let's cut to the chase.

37:18.211 --> 37:20.306
You saw what happened in Pegasus.

37:20.466 --> 37:22.430
You know what's happening here.

37:22.590 --> 37:25.762
You really think this is the way
it's supposed to be?

37:28.964 --> 37:30.871
<i>Maybe he felt sorry for me. Maybe...</i>

37:31.131 --> 37:34.165
he figured it wasn't gonna work,
but he let me through.

37:34.802 --> 37:36.248
The rest you know.

37:37.529 --> 37:38.535
Well,

37:38.837 --> 37:42.215
I guess I've had a tough day,
but you've had a tough 25 years.

37:44.656 --> 37:45.675
Okay,

37:46.199 --> 37:47.411
we're ready.

37:52.984 --> 37:54.477
Now, if this works,

37:54.940 --> 37:57.213
I'll be waiting right here
when you come out.

37:57.485 --> 38:00.400
We don't have much time to get you to
the Gate, but I think we can manage it.

38:01.593 --> 38:04.445
- And if it doesn't work?
- Well, you won't feel a thing.

38:04.605 --> 38:06.948
Basically, you just won't wake up.

38:08.527 --> 38:09.544
Right.

38:13.471 --> 38:16.249
In the past 25 years, you happen
to notice who won the Superbowl?

38:17.149 --> 38:18.335
I'm afraid not.

38:20.392 --> 38:22.839
Stanley cup? World series?

38:23.620 --> 38:27.510
- I was never really a sports fan.
- Right. I had to ask.

38:31.024 --> 38:32.368
Good luck, John.

38:48.281 --> 38:50.995
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation!</i>

38:52.580 --> 38:53.999
What have you got?

38:55.096 --> 38:57.016
Receiving IDC.

38:57.847 --> 38:59.194
It's Colonel Sheppard.

38:59.406 --> 39:00.916
Lower the shield.

39:04.534 --> 39:05.820
Security!

39:18.409 --> 39:20.720
- John...
- Colonel.

39:22.945 --> 39:25.777
It worked. It worked.
Rodney, you're a genius.

39:26.845 --> 39:28.873
- Okay.
- John, what happened?

39:29.033 --> 39:31.283
- How much time has gone by?
- 12 days.

39:31.543 --> 39:33.852
12 days... okay.
She wouldn't have had her baby yet.

39:34.012 --> 39:36.329
Look, I know this sounds kinda weird,
but we're on the clock.

39:36.589 --> 39:40.292
- John, what are you talking about?
- I know where Teyla is.

39:49.477 --> 39:51.178
We don't have time for this.

39:51.338 --> 39:53.700
There are procedures
we have to follow, you know that.

39:53.860 --> 39:54.931
I am not a clone.

39:55.191 --> 39:57.517
No, your medical came back clean,
telemeres and all,

39:57.777 --> 40:00.019
but there are other things
we need to discuss.

40:00.282 --> 40:03.068
You have to admit, this is a
pretty wild story, even for this place.

40:03.228 --> 40:05.454
But that's my whole point.
How could I make this up?

40:05.614 --> 40:08.194
<i>Sam, believe it or not, I found it.</i>

40:08.454 --> 40:11.199
It was in the sensor logs. It's a solar
flare capable of interfering

40:11.319 --> 40:12.866
with the wormhole from M4S-587,

40:13.077 --> 40:14.784
<i>at exactly the moment that he dialed.</i>

40:14.944 --> 40:17.412
Why didn't the Gate's failsafe
prevent the wormhole from locking?

40:18.768 --> 40:22.083
Well, we've had a number of glitches
since we last updated

40:22.343 --> 40:24.169
- <i>the operating system.</i>
- A glitch?

40:24.813 --> 40:27.293
Yes, well, you should know

40:27.453 --> 40:29.378
that I'll be giving Zelenka
a stern talking-to.

40:29.538 --> 40:30.778
Can we go now?

40:42.820 --> 40:43.821
Look,

40:44.067 --> 40:46.710
I know you've already been debriefed
about the future events,

40:46.870 --> 40:49.290
all the things we're hoping to avoid,
but there's just

40:49.450 --> 40:51.780
- one more thing I need to know.
- What?

40:52.137 --> 40:53.901
Do I still have hair?

40:55.664 --> 40:57.139
No. Let's go.

41:23.447 --> 41:26.095
- <i>Rodney, you got anything?</i>
- Hold on.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.218
Yeah...

41:28.719 --> 41:30.986
Yeah, I've got
some kind of a data terminal.

41:31.246 --> 41:33.739
I'll see if I can power it up
and hack in.

41:38.547 --> 41:40.410
This is it.
This is where they found her.

41:40.570 --> 41:43.326
- How do you know?
- Because he described it to me.

41:54.280 --> 41:55.476
Look at this.

41:56.317 --> 41:58.430
- <i>McKay, we got something.</i>
- What is it?

41:58.590 --> 42:01.182
<i>Some twisted version
of a maternity ward.</i>

42:01.817 --> 42:04.394
I think we're too early, though,
but he's gonna bring her here.

42:04.654 --> 42:06.146
Hold on, I'm in.

42:08.591 --> 42:09.357
Jackpot.

42:09.617 --> 42:11.610
- What have you got?
- I've got Gate addresses,

42:11.870 --> 42:13.233
I've communication codes,

42:13.393 --> 42:16.156
I've even got his research
into the hybrids. He's history.

42:17.959 --> 42:19.409
No, no, no, what happened?

42:20.549 --> 42:21.720
What's that?

42:22.157 --> 42:24.218
- Oh, no...
- Doc?

42:24.682 --> 42:25.749
It's a countdown.
