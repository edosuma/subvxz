00:01.125 --> 00:04.312
Welcome to the all-new
Ottoman Empire.

00:04.365 --> 00:06.502
I'm Johnny,
the brains of the outfit,

00:06.590 --> 00:08.330
and also the handsome one,

00:08.418 --> 00:11.439
because certain co-hosts
think that I'm in the way

00:11.527 --> 00:13.197
of him becoming a star.

00:13.285 --> 00:17.004
But you know what they say:
when the going gets tough...

00:17.425 --> 00:20.090
I actually don't know Randy's
half of the catchphrase.

00:20.269 --> 00:22.510
Louie, I've got something
for you.

00:22.598 --> 00:25.152
There was a printing error
on these business cards,

00:25.240 --> 00:26.761
so I got them for free.

00:26.849 --> 00:29.222
You could just cross out
the "Scrooge" and "M.C."

00:29.348 --> 00:31.574
and fill in with your own
name and company, eh?

00:31.702 --> 00:33.996
First of all,
what is a business card?

00:34.084 --> 00:35.425
And secondly,
I'm kind of over

00:35.513 --> 00:37.105
the whole "Louie Incorporated"
thing.

00:37.193 --> 00:39.550
But I thought you were off
to patent your...

00:39.718 --> 00:41.301
what was it, car-bed?

00:41.388 --> 00:43.421
Oh, the Nap-N-Go?
Yeah, I had to scrap it.

00:43.508 --> 00:45.221
Did someone else
claim the idea first?

00:45.308 --> 00:47.611
- No.
- Ah, so you found a design flaw

00:47.736 --> 00:49.509
- you couldn't work around?
- Nope.

00:50.047 --> 00:52.212
Was there a line
at the patent office?

00:52.300 --> 00:54.213
Bah, at least five
people deep.

00:54.301 --> 00:55.994
I realized it just
wasn't worth it.

00:56.082 --> 00:57.920
Iron my argyles!

00:58.008 --> 00:59.602
You're dropping
all your hopes and dreams

00:59.689 --> 01:01.446
at the first sight
of an obstacle?

01:01.534 --> 01:02.881
Yeah. Classic Louie.

01:02.968 --> 01:05.861
I will not be third-person
speechified to.

01:05.949 --> 01:07.384
- That's it.
- Whoa!

01:07.978 --> 01:12.915
Lad, it's time I regale you
with a rather simple saga.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.095
There I was...

01:16.206 --> 01:18.880
Hold up. Is this another
old-timey Scrooge story

01:18.968 --> 01:20.775
about grit
and determination?

01:20.863 --> 01:22.384
Just pay attention.

01:22.556 --> 01:26.158
So there I was,
in a town called Gumption,

01:26.246 --> 01:27.704
mining for a future.

01:27.792 --> 01:30.486
Still desperate
for a big score.

01:30.814 --> 01:33.171
Time to claim my destiny.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.783
Oh, boy.

02:36.340 --> 02:38.642
My travels
had brought me to Gumption,

02:38.931 --> 02:42.593
a town full of golden promise
and the promise of gold.

02:43.478 --> 02:46.025
I had the good sense
there was an ocean of aurum

02:46.113 --> 02:49.462
under this scrubby land
waiting to be unearthed.

02:51.095 --> 02:55.751
Back then, I was young,
gritty, hungry.

02:57.194 --> 02:59.027
Nothing could stop me.

02:59.115 --> 03:01.119
Nothing would get in my way

03:01.207 --> 03:04.767
of claiming
a McDuck gold nugget.

03:12.313 --> 03:14.159
Great globs of gold.

03:14.247 --> 03:15.472
Ha-ha!

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:41.638 --> 03:42.888
Oh...

03:43.606 --> 03:46.110
My fervor caused me
to get reckless,

03:46.221 --> 03:48.504
and now I was
utterly trapped.

03:48.592 --> 03:51.406
I wasn't sure if I'd survive
to see another face.

03:53.676 --> 03:56.524
Howdy, friend, it's me,
Sheriff Marshall Cabarera.

03:56.638 --> 03:59.297
Well, which is it,
sheriff or marshal?

03:59.385 --> 04:01.969
My name is Marshall, but I happen
to be Gumption's town sheriff.

04:02.057 --> 04:03.634
Though my friends
actually call me "Deputy,"

04:03.721 --> 04:05.540
which was my nickname
before I got the promotion.

04:05.627 --> 04:08.040
Hard to shake a nickname.
Anyway, need some help?

04:08.146 --> 04:11.164
Yes, could you find me
someone who is not you?

04:13.086 --> 04:16.000
I haven't seen you at any of
Gumption's town hall meetings.

04:16.649 --> 04:17.899
Prefer it that way.

04:18.039 --> 04:19.125
I work alone.

04:19.213 --> 04:21.670
Well, there's a big-timer from
the big city coming through,

04:21.757 --> 04:23.555
promising big things
for Gumption.

04:23.643 --> 04:25.556
I wanted to let
all you prospectors know.

04:25.644 --> 04:28.010
Uh, pardon me,
maybe it's the concussion,

04:28.098 --> 04:30.412
but I thought I heard you
add an "S"

04:30.500 --> 04:32.485
to the very singular
"prospector."

04:32.573 --> 04:35.774
As in, Scrooge McDuck,
the only prospector in town.

04:35.862 --> 04:37.145
Gumption's picking up.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.649
We're a two-prospector town now.

04:42.445 --> 04:44.350
Hornswogglin' hoarder,

04:44.438 --> 04:45.717
I'll turn him inside out!

04:45.805 --> 04:48.061
What no-good,
claim-hopping, miscreant

04:48.149 --> 04:50.383
would dare steal
from Scrooge McDuck?

04:50.471 --> 04:53.399
Hooty-hoo, Scroogie.

04:55.388 --> 04:56.551
Of course.

04:56.638 --> 04:57.801
Nope.

04:57.888 --> 05:00.024
Gross. Old-people romance.
Ugh!

05:00.112 --> 05:02.508
We weren't old back then.

05:02.596 --> 05:04.615
It's impossible
to picture you young.

05:04.703 --> 05:08.727
Goldie was and remains
a pain in my pinfeathers.

05:08.844 --> 05:10.672
No romance there.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.880
So there's no getting mushy?
No kissing? No hand-holding?

05:13.968 --> 05:15.227
Well...

05:16.606 --> 05:18.500
Coffee-boiling bunk artist!

05:18.588 --> 05:20.421
You hard-case old croaker!

05:20.597 --> 05:22.920
Oh good, you two
know each other.

05:23.077 --> 05:24.811
I want to remind y'all
once more

05:24.899 --> 05:27.586
that the town hall meeting
is tomorrow.

05:27.778 --> 05:29.460
Um... farewell?

05:29.548 --> 05:31.671
You're encroaching
on my pay dirt.

05:31.758 --> 05:34.011
How do you know that
I didn't find the claim first

05:34.098 --> 05:36.011
and that you're stealing
from me?

05:36.098 --> 05:37.399
Is that true?

05:37.487 --> 05:39.766
No, I followed you here
to steal your gold,

05:39.854 --> 05:42.985
but the fact that you didn't
think the opposite is hurtful, Scroogie.

05:43.073 --> 05:45.006
Ugh! Take a ride, Goldie.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.461
I've had enough
of your babbling bazoo.

05:47.548 --> 05:50.938
Whoa, can we cut back on the old
prospector slang a bit?

05:51.026 --> 05:52.385
Get lost, dude.

05:52.473 --> 05:54.420
You're killing
my vibe, man.

05:54.508 --> 05:55.842
Nope. Uh-uh, that's worse.

05:55.930 --> 05:56.998
Just go on.

05:57.086 --> 05:59.301
I'm not going anywhere,
you tightwad.

05:59.388 --> 06:01.264
Then you'll have to race me
to the mother lode,

06:01.352 --> 06:04.221
because I'm working day and
night till I find that gold...

06:04.308 --> 06:05.223
Ow!

06:05.311 --> 06:06.465
You'll need that, hon,

06:06.553 --> 06:09.770
because I just bought out
all the town's dynamite.

06:31.387 --> 06:33.661
Ow! Ow! Aah!

06:38.758 --> 06:40.548
Ah-ha.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.490
Yeah.

07:15.242 --> 07:16.242
Ha-ha!

07:17.638 --> 07:18.801
Ah-ha!

07:30.048 --> 07:31.631
Hey, you made it.

07:31.718 --> 07:34.091
Prospectors,
meet John D. Rockerduck,

07:34.178 --> 07:35.961
the new owner
of Gumption.

07:36.048 --> 07:37.591
Howdy, pard.

07:37.678 --> 07:40.261
Always a pleasure meeting
grubby working-class heroes

07:40.348 --> 07:41.718
like yourselves.

07:43.145 --> 07:45.106
I'll burn those later.

07:45.297 --> 07:48.550
Sheriff, can you kindly
remove these sourdoughs

07:48.638 --> 07:50.607
from my precious gold nugget?

07:54.809 --> 07:56.365
You need a name.

07:56.453 --> 07:58.630
The Gilded Gift?
The Thank You Kindly?

07:58.718 --> 08:01.216
The Big Rock of Gold?

08:01.327 --> 08:03.951
No. The Rockerduck Nugget.

08:04.148 --> 08:05.482
I mean, why overthink it?

08:05.570 --> 08:07.433
That's the McDuck Nugget!

08:07.521 --> 08:09.248
What's the meaning
of this thievery?

08:09.336 --> 08:10.935
Don't mind this rube.

08:11.048 --> 08:13.482
So, what's the meaning
of this pilfering?

08:13.570 --> 08:15.209
Thievery? Pilfering?

08:15.297 --> 08:18.550
Oh, no. I'm putting
the humble boomtown of...

08:18.848 --> 08:20.035
What is it? Gut Punch?

08:20.123 --> 08:21.605
- Gumption.
- Ah, Gumption.

08:21.693 --> 08:22.607
...on the map.

08:22.695 --> 08:24.380
Make it one of the shining
mega-cities

08:24.468 --> 08:25.412
of the American West.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.834
I've invested heavily
in this charming burg,

08:29.201 --> 08:32.154
with it's sand
and... tumbleweeds

08:32.287 --> 08:35.347
and... weathered,
sunburnt faces.

08:36.388 --> 08:38.260
And all I asked for
in return

08:38.347 --> 08:41.412
is the right to drill a teeny
hole in the center of town.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.990
But I staked a claim
on this plot months ago.

08:44.124 --> 08:47.497
Yes, but if I own the town,
I own everything in it

08:47.585 --> 08:48.878
and under it.

08:48.966 --> 08:50.379
Do you know
who you're messing with?

08:50.467 --> 08:52.250
That's the buckaroo
of the badlands,

08:52.365 --> 08:54.302
the maverick of the Montana
cattle wars.

08:54.390 --> 08:56.919
The legendary Scrooge McDuck.

08:57.959 --> 09:00.878
You cross him and get ready for
a cross hook across your jaw.

09:00.966 --> 09:01.722
Ain't that right?

09:01.809 --> 09:03.881
I'll make the declarations
from here.

09:03.968 --> 09:07.678
Get your plundering paws
off my caches.

09:08.999 --> 09:11.300
You going to take that guff
from this foolish, mangy,

09:11.388 --> 09:12.404
flea-bitten peasant?

09:12.499 --> 09:15.952
His filthy mitts all over
your finely pressed suit.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.460
Ha-ha. That would cost you,
small-timer.

09:18.548 --> 09:21.912
I studied Queensberry rules.
Put up your dukes.

09:22.858 --> 09:25.481
Jab, jab, uppercut, cross.

09:25.647 --> 09:27.255
I'll butter your bean.

09:27.343 --> 09:28.503
Ha-ha.

09:30.992 --> 09:33.849
Sheriff Marshall,
a fight's breaking out.

09:35.819 --> 09:39.442
For a starving prospector,
you are very strong.

09:51.808 --> 09:54.881
You big galoot, you're not going
to stand for this.

09:54.968 --> 09:56.961
Do you know who you are?

09:57.048 --> 09:58.461
Oh, horsefeathers.

09:58.548 --> 10:00.671
I ran out of people
to pit against each other.

10:05.048 --> 10:06.961
You're making
a big mistake.

10:07.048 --> 10:09.548
Sorry, the law's the law.

10:11.196 --> 10:13.011
I should've never
left Dawson.

10:13.098 --> 10:15.226
At least the sheriff there
had the common decency

10:15.314 --> 10:16.335
to be crooked.

10:16.423 --> 10:17.761
What a mess, huh?

10:17.848 --> 10:19.761
How will they get
out of this tight spot?

10:19.848 --> 10:24.509
Find out when we come back with
more all-new Ottoman Empire.

10:24.597 --> 10:26.267
I don't remember that.

10:27.777 --> 10:29.634
What? I'm so invested
in your story

10:29.722 --> 10:31.517
that I wanted to record this
to watch later.

10:31.605 --> 10:33.388
It's a compliment.

10:33.601 --> 10:35.173
Hmm.

10:35.617 --> 10:36.870
Anyway...

10:37.098 --> 10:40.243
Once again, you've gotten
in my way of striking it rich.

10:40.331 --> 10:41.767
Me? It's not my fault

10:41.855 --> 10:43.696
you started brawling
with Rockerduck.

10:43.784 --> 10:46.355
It was literally
your fault!

10:46.573 --> 10:47.943
And a lot of good it did me.

10:48.031 --> 10:49.954
Now we're stuck
in here together.

10:50.993 --> 10:52.591
Enough!

10:53.067 --> 10:55.848
What's it take to get
a quiet jail cell?

10:57.339 --> 10:58.575
Who are you?

10:58.718 --> 11:01.829
Nobody. Just your common
crackpot outlaw,

11:01.917 --> 11:04.276
definitely not a brilliant
scientist from the future

11:04.364 --> 11:05.461
accidentally stuck
in the Old West.

11:05.548 --> 11:06.808
I mean, current West.

11:13.914 --> 11:16.041
I am going to throttle
that rich cad

11:16.129 --> 11:17.551
and get my gold back.

11:17.638 --> 11:19.011
Nothing will stand
in my way.

11:19.098 --> 11:20.856
Not you, or you,

11:20.944 --> 11:22.727
or that weird fella up there.

11:22.815 --> 11:24.648
Best get that business
out your head.

11:24.736 --> 11:27.229
The man and the gold
are on a train leaving town.

11:27.317 --> 11:28.770
- You let him go?
- You let him go?

11:28.858 --> 11:31.941
Oh, he'll be back soon enough
to rebuild Gumption as promised.

11:32.029 --> 11:33.812
Mr. Rockerduck
is good people.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.693
John D. Rockerduck?

11:35.781 --> 11:39.154
He was historically infamous
for swindling every town he hit.

11:39.242 --> 11:40.526
Robbing them of all
mineral rights

11:40.613 --> 11:42.486
and leaving behind
a ghost town.

11:42.574 --> 11:44.027
No, no, you got it wrong.

11:44.115 --> 11:45.840
He's going to put Gumption
on the map,

11:45.928 --> 11:48.381
make it a famous city
that everybody's heard of.

11:48.468 --> 11:51.051
Like Ragged Flats,
and Crazy Howl,

11:51.138 --> 11:54.371
and... Grind Creek, and...

11:55.120 --> 11:57.200
he's never coming back,
is he?

12:00.946 --> 12:02.754
What now, Scroogie?

12:02.888 --> 12:05.731
I'm fixing to steal
what I rightfully earned.

12:06.048 --> 12:10.011
The Outlaw Scrooge McDuck
has got a train to rob.

12:11.178 --> 12:13.631
Maybe don't say that
till we're out of jail.

12:13.756 --> 12:16.825
Together, we are going
to form a notorious posse

12:16.913 --> 12:20.156
and bring the McDuck nugget
back to Gumption.

12:20.258 --> 12:21.770
And why should we help you?

12:21.858 --> 12:25.215
Because we love gold
more than we hate each other.

12:30.278 --> 12:33.521
First, we need to find a way
to bust out of this hoosegow.

12:33.616 --> 12:35.409
Some nitric acid, perhaps,

12:35.504 --> 12:39.098
or a spoon to slowly saw
through the bars.

12:39.285 --> 12:41.301
Or I could just
let you out.

12:41.410 --> 12:44.881
How can we trust this lawman
to help with the heist?

12:44.968 --> 12:47.961
Ma'am, this tin star here
means I pursue justice

12:48.048 --> 12:49.091
against all crooks,

12:49.178 --> 12:52.309
especially swindlers that aim
to do harm to my town.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.560
Attalad.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.319
So how are we going
to catch up to this train?

12:55.406 --> 12:58.406
Oi, wacky nameless inventor,
any ideas?

13:05.008 --> 13:06.921
Rocket horses!

13:07.008 --> 13:09.171
- Galloping gold prices!
- Thunderation!

13:09.258 --> 13:12.671
Good, glad you like it,
because my backup plan was...

13:12.758 --> 13:14.098
uh, problematic.

13:16.590 --> 13:17.721
Once on board,

13:17.808 --> 13:20.841
Goldie and I will pass ourselves
as rich muckety mucks

13:20.928 --> 13:24.262
to get access to Rockerduck's
exclusive dining car.

13:24.350 --> 13:27.645
Goldie will distract Rockerduck
as I lift the key

13:27.733 --> 13:29.841
for the cargo car
containing the nugget.

13:29.929 --> 13:32.848
There is no way dirty,
dour Scrooge McDuck

13:32.936 --> 13:36.731
could pass off as wealthy.

13:41.138 --> 13:45.169
That, ahem,
top hat suits you.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.011
It covers your bald spot.

13:50.808 --> 13:53.301
I'm not one for these
newfangled science doohickeys.

13:53.388 --> 13:54.671
Prefer a trusty thoroughbred.

13:54.758 --> 13:56.604
A horse galloping at a steady
30 miles per hour

13:56.692 --> 13:57.795
could outpace
the limited thrust

13:57.882 --> 13:59.585
of these rudimentary
propulsion engines.

13:59.673 --> 14:03.090
You are very familiarly
frustrating to me.

14:03.178 --> 14:05.700
Saddle up, outlaws.

14:08.302 --> 14:10.802
Yee-haw!

14:19.491 --> 14:22.869
I get such a thrill
hustling these dirtwater towns.

14:22.957 --> 14:25.710
I mean, who drinks
dirt water?

14:25.853 --> 14:27.548
Dummies, that's who.

14:28.830 --> 14:30.195
Now, laugh.

14:34.256 --> 14:35.486
Oh, I'm rich.

14:35.574 --> 14:39.314
But, sir, do you feel no guilt
in breaking your promises?

14:40.527 --> 14:42.090
Jeeves.

14:53.731 --> 14:55.684
Ah, much better.

14:55.772 --> 14:59.042
Whoa! Is that a feather
in my oyster stew?

15:00.155 --> 15:03.292
This is a luxury locomotive,
not some chicken barn.

15:09.997 --> 15:12.415
Why am I even eating
scorching-hot food

15:12.525 --> 15:13.408
in scorching-hot weather?

15:13.496 --> 15:16.429
Why is it even on the menu?
Cold up this soup.

15:16.517 --> 15:17.955
Cold it up.

15:18.679 --> 15:19.908
There's Rockerduck.

15:19.996 --> 15:22.087
You see what you've done?
You've got me worked up.

15:22.831 --> 15:24.892
I'll snag the key from him
while you...

15:25.000 --> 15:27.790
well, do what you do best.

15:29.335 --> 15:31.085
Be an annoying diversion.

15:38.758 --> 15:40.892
May I have your attention?

15:42.769 --> 15:45.229
Follow me for the key change
and try to keep up.

16:28.062 --> 16:30.765
Lasso the gold nugget
to the nodes here,

16:30.853 --> 16:31.896
then pump the velocitator.

16:31.984 --> 16:34.099
Faster. Faster.

16:34.312 --> 16:35.602
No, too fast!

16:40.794 --> 16:42.271
No, no, no!

16:42.380 --> 16:43.511
This is a calamity.

16:43.598 --> 16:44.872
Waterloo. Blue ruin.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.763
How am I going
to catch the train now?

16:50.675 --> 16:52.435
Hold up a second.

16:52.523 --> 16:54.982
How could you possibly know what
the sheriff and the inventor

16:55.070 --> 16:57.533
were talking about
when you were on the train?

16:57.808 --> 17:00.261
Look who's suddenly
invested.

17:00.927 --> 17:02.021
No, it's just...

17:03.140 --> 17:04.473
Just please keep going.

17:04.778 --> 17:07.489
Come on, wake up, wake up.
We're missing the train.

17:13.468 --> 17:15.008
Whoa!

17:15.700 --> 17:19.271
Blathering blatherskite,
get this contraption off me!

17:31.848 --> 17:33.645
Eureka.

17:54.468 --> 17:56.721
Hands off, you humongous
hooligan.

17:56.808 --> 18:00.301
You heard the codger,
hands off!

18:17.468 --> 18:19.261
Stop in the name of the law.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.638
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

18:30.718 --> 18:33.468
Hurry. That's Gumption Gulch
approaching fast.

18:41.508 --> 18:43.218
Ready to jump?

18:44.218 --> 18:45.848
Yeow!

18:48.348 --> 18:49.761
Look here, friend.

18:49.848 --> 18:53.011
Rockerduck has no regard
for hardworking lads like us,

18:53.098 --> 18:54.721
born from the grind.

18:54.808 --> 18:55.843
Don't you know
who you are?

18:55.930 --> 18:58.519
A working-class hoofer,
just like us.

18:58.607 --> 19:01.475
Only much,
much bigger.

19:01.701 --> 19:04.381
You deserve
a piece of this too.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.169
Hmm.

19:15.636 --> 19:17.229
Ah, perfectly tepid.

19:17.668 --> 19:18.918
What?

19:22.258 --> 19:23.471
Well, dang.

19:24.308 --> 19:26.793
- Whoo-hoo!
- Back to Gumption.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.254
Whoa!

19:36.178 --> 19:37.388
Wait! The gold!

19:44.522 --> 19:47.077
No!

19:57.733 --> 19:59.921
Well, we didn't get the gold,

20:00.011 --> 20:01.964
but at least Rockerduck
didn't either, right?

20:02.052 --> 20:03.545
Mm.

20:03.655 --> 20:05.897
Heck of a missed
opportunity.

20:10.008 --> 20:11.647
What is going on?

20:11.735 --> 20:13.303
- Gold! - Gold! - Gold!
- Gold! - Gold! - Gold!

20:13.428 --> 20:16.051
Get out of my way!
I want some of that gold!

20:16.138 --> 20:17.888
Hey, slow down.

20:18.936 --> 20:20.526
Of course.

20:20.622 --> 20:23.340
Gumption Gulch flows
right back into town.

20:23.428 --> 20:25.452
You helped return the gold
back to Gumption.

20:25.561 --> 20:27.639
You're not outlaws,
you're heroes.

20:27.888 --> 20:29.569
Heroes, yes.

20:29.657 --> 20:31.780
Much better than gold.

20:31.868 --> 20:33.233
Much better.

20:33.321 --> 20:38.154
Oh, Scroogie, why do you suppose
I came all the way out here?

20:38.255 --> 20:41.130
To, uh, get one over on me?

20:41.218 --> 20:42.920
Well, that.

20:43.008 --> 20:46.741
But also, I wanted
to see you again.

20:46.829 --> 20:49.879
Um, it's good
to see you too.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.334
You and that sweet kisser.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.053
Oops.

21:02.077 --> 21:04.217
Oh, no, you don't!

21:04.484 --> 21:06.645
And while Goldie made off

21:06.733 --> 21:08.381
with much of the stray gold,

21:08.468 --> 21:11.889
I did create a profitable
panning venture there...

21:11.987 --> 21:15.738
Until that lead to the Great
Goldwater Battle of Gumption.

21:15.826 --> 21:16.961
Whoa, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

21:17.048 --> 21:18.701
- This isn't the end?
- Well, no.

21:18.789 --> 21:20.800
Becoming rich
is an endless cycle

21:20.888 --> 21:22.654
of obstacles
and opportunities.

21:22.742 --> 21:24.115
Then what's the point?

21:24.203 --> 21:25.506
Let me rephrase.

21:25.725 --> 21:27.693
How do you want
to make your fortune?

21:27.781 --> 21:29.944
By being a con man,
like Rockerduck?

21:30.032 --> 21:32.576
A shifty operator,
like Goldie?

21:32.758 --> 21:36.461
Or an industrious,
resourceful, self-made man

21:36.548 --> 21:38.756
like your dear uncle?

21:42.719 --> 21:44.068
What year is it?

21:44.170 --> 21:45.590
Uh... oh...

21:46.562 --> 21:48.053
Hello, Miss O'Gilt?

21:48.141 --> 21:49.256
Can I call you Goldie?

21:49.344 --> 21:50.637
Absolutely not?
Great, great.

21:50.725 --> 21:53.428
I'm looking to operate
my company more shiftily.

21:53.718 --> 21:56.221
Could you teach me
to do what you do?

21:56.308 --> 21:59.468
Yeah, it probably would make
my uncle very mad.
