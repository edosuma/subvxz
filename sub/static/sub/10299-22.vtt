01:15.067 --> 01:17.700
We won!
We won!
We won!

01:17.734 --> 01:20.934
Oh, Al, listen
to my heartbeat. Oh.

01:24.801 --> 01:26.133
It's incredible, Peg.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.366
I can hear it
from here.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.667
Sir, your ear hair
is sticking me.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.633
Get over here and celebrate
with your family.

01:36.834 --> 01:38.700
That man cut in front of me.

01:38.734 --> 01:41.366
I should have been
the millionth customer.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.867
Bundy. Cut in front
of this woman?

01:44.901 --> 01:46.967
What woman?

01:47.801 --> 01:51.533
Oh, you know it was me,
you gaggle of pirates.

01:51.567 --> 01:54.099
Now, I have stood
mutely by for five years

01:54.133 --> 01:56.166
and watched you
steal my paper,

01:56.200 --> 01:57.633
siphon my gas,

01:57.667 --> 02:01.099
loiter in my bushes
doing God knows what.

02:01.133 --> 02:02.867
But I will not permit this.

02:02.901 --> 02:04.834
This is
my $1000 shopping spree

02:04.868 --> 02:06.733
and I will have
my shopping spree,

02:06.767 --> 02:09.532
if I have to carry my groceries
home in your skulls.

02:11.467 --> 02:13.600
You want me
to clock her one, Daddy?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.434
Let me handle this.

02:19.934 --> 02:23.867
You know what you need to take
your mind off this, babe?

02:25.501 --> 02:28.101
A nice, cool Bud.

02:33.901 --> 02:37.667
And, uh, keep the biting
to a minimum.

02:38.067 --> 02:40.034
It's a school night.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.099
Excuse me. Coming through,
coming through.

02:49.133 --> 02:50.834
Hi, there.
I'm Mr. Foodie.

02:50.868 --> 02:52.800
I'm here to congratulate
the lucky winner.

02:52.834 --> 02:54.266
By the way, who is it?

02:54.300 --> 02:55.633
Me! Me!

02:55.667 --> 02:57.900
What a lovely couple.

02:57.934 --> 03:00.099
Uh, I'm not married
to thisthing,

03:00.133 --> 03:02.034
I'm married
to that thing.

03:03.634 --> 03:07.567
Wait a second.
Aren't you Al Bundy?

03:07.601 --> 03:09.600
Did you let this man pay
with a check?

03:09.634 --> 03:10.633
Hey.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.433
The only thing wrong
with my checks

03:12.467 --> 03:15.867
is they're postdated,
like your milk.

03:15.901 --> 03:18.999
This man cut in front
of me and bought gum.

03:19.033 --> 03:22.033
Now, I have been a faithful
customer of this store

03:22.067 --> 03:23.266
for many years.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.266
My checks are always good.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.966
I have a preferred
customer card.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.066
And I know the Foodies jingle
by heart:

03:30.100 --> 03:31.066
* Foodies *

03:31.100 --> 03:32.999
* We're a store with food *

03:33.033 --> 03:36.034
* And heart *

03:37.334 --> 03:39.300
Well, you know,
that only proves

03:39.334 --> 03:42.366
that you two have
little rhythm and no lives.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.533
We, on the other hand,
have a receipt...

03:45.567 --> 03:47.700
and no lives.

03:47.734 --> 03:50.600
And besides,
we live here.

03:50.634 --> 03:51.834
Hush, pumpkin.

03:51.868 --> 03:54.834
Now, now, go wheel
your brother to the car.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.834
All right, Foodie, now,
what are you gonna do here?

03:57.868 --> 03:59.767
Well, there's only
one fair way.

03:59.801 --> 04:01.366
Give us
both prizes?

04:01.400 --> 04:04.133
No, I meant fair
for Foodies.

04:04.167 --> 04:07.400
No, we'll let you compete for
the millionth-customer prize.

04:07.434 --> 04:09.467
Yes, you'll both be
in the shopping spree,

04:09.501 --> 04:10.467
And whoever comes up

04:10.501 --> 04:12.767
with $1000 worth
of groceries first

04:12.801 --> 04:14.300
gets to keep 'em.

04:14.334 --> 04:15.834
Well, what does
the loser get?

04:15.868 --> 04:18.899
Gets to congratulate
the winner.

04:21.634 --> 04:24.467
You know, Al,
I've been thinking.

04:24.501 --> 04:28.233
What if we really do win
that $1000 worth of groceries?

04:28.267 --> 04:30.099
Then what do we do?

04:30.133 --> 04:31.867
<i>Well, Peg, I saw on
60 Minutes last week,</i>

04:31.901 --> 04:33.333
where some people found
with food

04:33.367 --> 04:35.434
actually cook it up
and eat it.

04:36.534 --> 04:39.433
I've never seen Morley
so shaken.

04:39.467 --> 04:40.867
So I was right.

04:40.901 --> 04:42.867
I'm not the winner
in this at all.

04:42.901 --> 04:45.467
You get all the food
and the glory,

04:45.501 --> 04:46.999
and I just get
endless hours

04:47.033 --> 04:50.167
standing in front
of the big hot thing.

04:50.934 --> 04:52.400
No, Peg,
that's the stove.

04:52.434 --> 04:55.101
You're
the big hot thing.

04:58.334 --> 05:00.900
Peg, Peg,
I'll tell you what.

05:00.934 --> 05:04.300
If we win this contest...
I get six hot meals.

05:04.334 --> 05:05.934
Then we sell
the rest of the food,

05:05.968 --> 05:07.300
we get
an air conditioner.

05:07.334 --> 05:09.200
Really, Al? You mean it?

05:09.234 --> 05:10.800
We get an air conditioner?

05:10.834 --> 05:12.734
Six meals, Peg.

05:12.801 --> 05:13.767
One.
Four.

05:13.801 --> 05:14.867
One.
Three.

05:14.901 --> 05:15.867
One.
Two.

05:15.901 --> 05:17.401
One.
Done!

05:22.100 --> 05:25.433
Mom, Dad, I think
we're in for some trouble.

05:25.467 --> 05:27.633
Mr. and Mrs. D'Arcy are
out there doing wind sprints

05:27.667 --> 05:28.934
around the neighborhood.

05:28.968 --> 05:31.033
Then they come to stop signs
and drop for pushups.

05:31.067 --> 05:33.800
Yeah, Jefferson does 25
with Marcie on his back,

05:33.834 --> 05:36.934
and then Marcie does 50
with Jefferson on her back.

05:38.133 --> 05:40.366
I'm not worried.
I'm a finely honed athlete.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.733
And as for your mother,

05:41.767 --> 05:44.267
Peg, show them what
a real pushup looks like.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.733
All right, kids, I admit it.
I did not marry well.

05:53.767 --> 05:56.333
But...if you haven't
ever believed

05:56.367 --> 05:57.667
anything I've ever told you...

05:57.701 --> 05:59.099
And we haven't.

05:59.133 --> 06:01.133
...believe this:

06:01.167 --> 06:04.001
We will win
this contest.

06:06.167 --> 06:09.200
We will win.
We will win big.

06:09.234 --> 06:11.333
We will win
in the Bundy tradition:

06:11.367 --> 06:13.267
We will cheat
our heinies off.

06:16.067 --> 06:17.966
Now, can I get
a "whoa, Bundy"?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.434
Whoaaaa, Bundy!

06:34.767 --> 06:37.500
Look, Marcie.
Best cart in the lot.

06:37.534 --> 06:38.867
The Foodies cart stunk,

06:38.901 --> 06:42.166
but I got this baby from
a bag lady across the street.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.867
They always have
the best stuff.

06:43.901 --> 06:48.099
You excite me like
no man I've ever met.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.767
No mercy to the Bundys.

06:49.801 --> 06:51.834
No mercy.

06:56.601 --> 06:59.734
Let's see 'em
top this, baby.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.334
Excuse me.

07:17.467 --> 07:20.133
What is
this contraption?

07:20.167 --> 07:22.834
That's Peg.
You know her.

07:23.334 --> 07:25.834
Not that,
Pillsbury Shoeboy.

07:27.100 --> 07:30.467
This thing you're pushing,
this is not a regulation cart.

07:30.501 --> 07:33.633
<i>Au contraire, buzz cut.</i>

07:33.667 --> 07:35.667
I found it right outside.
Didn't I, family?

07:35.701 --> 07:37.366
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah, you did.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.133
Mr. Foodie,
a ruling, please.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.333
Hm?

07:41.367 --> 07:43.333
Oh, I don't know.

07:43.367 --> 07:44.767
No, it's one of yours.

07:44.801 --> 07:46.633
See? It says "We love Foodies"
on the side.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.333
Oh, I like that!

07:48.367 --> 07:51.134
Here, let's-- Let's get
a picture of that baby.

07:52.100 --> 07:55.400
But I'm not sure that
this cart is one of mine.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.400
Well-- Hey...

07:57.434 --> 07:59.300
Doesn't wobble. Hm.

07:59.334 --> 08:03.434
Get these people
a regulation Foodies cart.

08:15.434 --> 08:17.200
All right, contestants,
places, please.

08:17.234 --> 08:20.433
Dad, where'd you get
this cart?

08:20.467 --> 08:23.099
Made it myself in the garage
with parts of the lawn mower

08:23.133 --> 08:25.700
and the side of the house
and your mother's car.

08:25.734 --> 08:27.200
See, it's aerodynamic,

08:27.234 --> 08:29.133
got your front and rear
sway bars,

08:29.167 --> 08:31.133
rack-and-pinion steering,

08:31.167 --> 08:33.633
and genuine Ginsu spike
attitude adjusters

08:33.667 --> 08:35.167
on the hood.

08:36.433 --> 08:40.500
It's also got some, uh,
antipersonnel device or two...

08:40.534 --> 08:42.767
just for show.

08:48.534 --> 08:49.999
Damn that hair trigger.

08:50.033 --> 08:52.966
There goes
my tiebreaker, Peg.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.400
Well, what do you think?

08:54.434 --> 08:55.733
You can do all this,

08:55.767 --> 08:58.400
and yet you can't get
a better job than shoe salesman?

08:58.434 --> 09:00.300
I think
a little research will show

09:00.334 --> 09:02.400
that most of your great
implements of death

09:02.434 --> 09:06.167
are the result of zombied-out
daydreams of shoe salesmen.

09:08.033 --> 09:10.400
Well, now it's time to announce
the celebrity host

09:10.434 --> 09:14.200
of the Foodies millionth
customer competition.

09:14.234 --> 09:16.733
Well, you loved him
as the Beaver,

09:16.767 --> 09:21.400
and...now, I guess, er,
as the new Beaver.

09:21.434 --> 09:23.333
So let's give a nice,
warm Foodies welcome

09:23.367 --> 09:25.267
to Jerry Mathers.

09:35.834 --> 09:37.300
Thank you very much.

09:37.334 --> 09:38.800
You're very kind.

09:38.834 --> 09:43.001
I, uh, think our agreement
called for cash in advance.

09:45.267 --> 09:46.733
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:46.767 --> 09:50.233
it's certainly a pleasure
to be here at Foodies,

09:50.267 --> 09:56.233
the store with great food
and super low prices.

09:56.267 --> 09:57.433
Oh, merciful heavens,

09:57.467 --> 09:59.667
won't somebody please
shoot me?

09:59.701 --> 10:00.999
Somebody, please,

10:01.033 --> 10:04.800
just put a bullet
through the ol' Beav's head.

10:04.834 --> 10:07.066
Oh, Al, look at him.

10:07.100 --> 10:10.700
He's brought so much pleasure
to so many.

10:10.734 --> 10:13.633
Can't you give him a job
at the shoe store?

10:13.667 --> 10:15.300
Yeah, that's
all I need, Peg:

10:15.334 --> 10:18.600
Work all day with the Beaver
and come home to you.

10:22.968 --> 10:24.934
And, uh, now for the rules:

10:24.968 --> 10:28.066
Whoever gets $1000 worth
of food first

10:28.100 --> 10:29.600
gets to keep it.

10:29.634 --> 10:32.934
Which, by the way, is more
than I'm getting for this gig.

10:32.968 --> 10:34.934
Can it be true?

10:34.968 --> 10:38.333
<i>Can Match Game PM
not use another celebrity?</i>

10:38.367 --> 10:44.468
Am I truly lower
than Charles Nelson Reilly?

10:45.267 --> 10:48.533
Who is
this blubbering mess?

10:49.167 --> 10:51.867
I think he was Opie.

10:52.868 --> 10:57.368
Opie was Ron Howard,
you little fool.

10:58.601 --> 11:00.533
I was--

11:00.567 --> 11:03.734
<i>No, I am the Beaver!</i>

11:04.534 --> 11:07.934
Thank you, Jerry Mathers.
Everybody. Everybody.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.900
Spare me
your pity clap.

11:17.167 --> 11:19.633
Sign this, Opie.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.468
It's Jerry,
and it'll be two bucks.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.667
Well,
what I think, uh--

11:25.701 --> 11:27.567
I think Mr. Mathers
means is, uh,

11:27.601 --> 11:29.600
contestants,
wish each other good luck.

11:29.634 --> 11:30.600
Drop dead.

11:30.634 --> 11:31.767
Lick feet.
Eat dust.

11:31.801 --> 11:33.867
Grow hair.

11:34.534 --> 11:36.733
On your mark...

11:36.767 --> 11:38.667
get set...

11:39.901 --> 11:41.500
...go!

11:41.534 --> 11:43.800
Come on, Peg. Come on, Peg!

11:48.834 --> 11:52.033
Follow me, Peg!
Follow me, baby!

11:52.067 --> 11:55.099
Come on, Peg, follow me!
Just like we planned.

11:55.133 --> 11:57.834
Just like we practiced.
Here's one.

11:57.868 --> 11:59.867
Here's two. Here's three.

11:59.901 --> 12:03.967
Peg! Peg!
Where is that damn woman?

12:04.734 --> 12:06.500
Look, Al. "Do It To Me Red."

12:06.534 --> 12:09.033
They never have this
at my salon.

12:09.067 --> 12:12.301
Look, if you want me,
I'll be in beauty supplies.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.266
Hut!
Hut!

12:14.300 --> 12:15.333
Hut!
Hut!

12:15.367 --> 12:16.667
Hut!
Hut!

12:16.701 --> 12:17.867
Hut!
Hu--

12:17.901 --> 12:19.366
Too cheap, honey.
We don't need it.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.034
I know.

12:29.567 --> 12:32.400
Look, Al. I found
this really expensive--

12:32.434 --> 12:34.400
Al?

12:34.434 --> 12:38.233
Al Bundy, would you stop
fooling around?

12:38.267 --> 12:40.034
Come on.

12:42.033 --> 12:43.867
Al!

12:43.901 --> 12:47.767
Uh, listen, could you settle
a bet between me and my sister?

12:47.801 --> 12:49.966
Now, she says you frittered away
all your money

12:50.000 --> 12:53.200
on booze and cheap women.

12:53.234 --> 12:56.967
I say doughnuts
and cheap booze.

12:59.267 --> 13:03.101
Give me a quarter
or just go away.

13:14.767 --> 13:18.267
Get it in there.
Let's go. Let's go.

13:32.868 --> 13:34.734
<i>Viva la Cart of Death!</i>

13:37.968 --> 13:39.633
Mr. Beaver?

13:39.667 --> 13:42.867
Could you settle another bet
between me and my brother?

13:42.901 --> 13:45.900
He says that you're so low,
that for this nickel,

13:45.934 --> 13:47.700
that you would stand
on this chair

13:47.734 --> 13:49.800
and bellow
like a moose.

13:49.834 --> 13:51.800
Now, I say, if you could
bellow like a moose,

13:51.834 --> 13:54.234
why would you be here?

13:55.667 --> 13:57.033
Beav.

13:57.067 --> 13:59.133
Oh, Beav.

13:59.167 --> 14:01.066
<i>Attention, contestants.</i>

14:01.100 --> 14:02.467
<i>Our first totals are in.</i>

14:02.501 --> 14:04.600
<i>The Bundys, $210.</i>

14:04.634 --> 14:07.301
<i>The D'Arcys, 270.</i>

14:08.767 --> 14:11.401
Eat
hot grocery death!

14:12.434 --> 14:14.934
Al! Honey!
We're losing!

14:14.968 --> 14:16.700
Now, you're a pro at that.
Do something!

14:16.734 --> 14:17.834
Stay calm, Peg.

14:17.868 --> 14:19.467
We've been paying
too much attention

14:19.501 --> 14:20.733
to what they
have been doing.

14:20.767 --> 14:22.200
From now on,
we play with our heads

14:22.234 --> 14:23.567
instead of our hearts.
Come on.

14:23.601 --> 14:24.567
Okay.

14:24.601 --> 14:25.567
Hut!

14:25.601 --> 14:27.266
Hut!

14:27.300 --> 14:28.867
Come on, Marcie.
Hut!

14:30.133 --> 14:31.900
Jefferson.
Huh?

14:38.067 --> 14:41.233
See, Peg, if I was playing with
my heart instead of my head,

14:41.267 --> 14:42.999
I'd have waited
till Marcie was loading.

14:43.033 --> 14:44.633
Oh, you're a good man, Al.

14:44.667 --> 14:47.201
And a pretty darn
good friend too.

14:49.734 --> 14:52.700
Come on, Peg!
Come on, Peg!

14:53.334 --> 14:56.366
the D'Arcys, $720 worth.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.567
The Bundys, $710.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.700
Look, here's 50 cents.

15:03.734 --> 15:04.767
It's all I have.

15:04.801 --> 15:07.468
Just please,
leave me alone.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.300
Just one last question,

15:10.334 --> 15:13.900
if all the autographs hounds
can stay back for a second...

15:16.267 --> 15:18.800
Did you ever think of teaming up
with the Eddie Munster kid

15:18.834 --> 15:21.301
for the Thoroughly
Pathetic Tour '91?

15:22.267 --> 15:24.867
Look...

15:24.901 --> 15:27.099
let's get this over with
once and for all.

15:27.133 --> 15:29.999
I may have to earn
a pathetic living

15:30.033 --> 15:32.033
by donning the cap
of the Beaver

15:32.067 --> 15:33.767
and appearing
at supermarkets,

15:33.801 --> 15:39.567
but at least my father doesn't
sell women's shoes.

15:47.934 --> 15:50.800
Golly, that felt good.

16:31.534 --> 16:32.767
That's my douche!

16:32.801 --> 16:34.401
Oh, yeah?

16:35.901 --> 16:37.934
Yeah? Well, you touched
my Girlie Fizz.

16:37.968 --> 16:39.834
Come on, give me that.
It's mine and I want it.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.166
Damn it, Al!
Now, we're both men.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.333
There's plenty of room
in feminine hygiene

16:44.367 --> 16:46.366
for the both of us.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.067
All right?
Let's shake on it.

16:53.501 --> 16:55.667
I'm blind!

16:55.701 --> 16:58.401
And I smell
like summer rain!

16:59.701 --> 17:02.467
Peg! Peg, where are you?

17:02.501 --> 17:04.266
Right here, honey.

17:04.300 --> 17:07.666
Damn Jefferson blinded me
with feminine goo.

17:07.701 --> 17:09.934
He ought to take some home
and spray it in his own eyes

17:09.968 --> 17:11.333
before he gets in bed
with that--

17:11.367 --> 17:12.934
Ow!

17:12.968 --> 17:14.567
Ow!

17:15.534 --> 17:18.433
Al, Al, honey, come on,
stop dilly-dallying.

17:18.467 --> 17:19.633
We're behind!

17:19.666 --> 17:20.900
Come on.

17:20.934 --> 17:23.034
Let's go.

17:23.467 --> 17:24.700
Jefferson, bonanza!

17:24.733 --> 17:26.633
Imported water!

17:26.968 --> 17:28.934
Oh, my God, my contact.

17:28.968 --> 17:31.101
I've lost my contact.

17:34.634 --> 17:36.433
You know, the problem
with you, Al,

17:36.467 --> 17:39.033
is you're playing too much
with Jefferson and Marcie

17:39.067 --> 17:41.500
to pay attention
to what you're doing.

17:42.501 --> 17:45.967
I guess I'll just have to pay
attention for the both of us.

17:48.968 --> 17:52.900
Jefferson, I've fallen,
and I can't get up.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.166
Marcie? Marcie?

17:57.200 --> 17:59.167
Where are you?

18:07.367 --> 18:08.733
There you are.

18:08.767 --> 18:11.733
Look, Marcie.
Shallots from Italy.

18:11.767 --> 18:14.133
You know how much
these babies are worth?

18:14.167 --> 18:15.667
I don't know, honey.

18:15.701 --> 18:18.733
You think now you could
dash over to the first-aid aisle

18:18.767 --> 18:21.233
and see if you can find me
an artery clip?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.500
Okey-dokey.

18:26.567 --> 18:28.734
Ah, me.

18:35.367 --> 18:36.567
That's me.

18:36.601 --> 18:38.667
I was the Beaver.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.533
Who?

19:06.367 --> 19:08.467
Our two families are running
neck and neck.

19:08.501 --> 19:11.233
The, uh, the D'Arcys, $990.

19:11.267 --> 19:13.900
The Bundys, $979.

19:13.934 --> 19:17.500
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's a horse race.

19:27.067 --> 19:30.033
They've incapacitated
the Cart of Death, Peg!

19:30.067 --> 19:33.166
Oh, no.
Al, we're gonna lose!

19:33.200 --> 19:35.500
Not this time, babe.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.967
Stee-rike!

20:16.968 --> 20:19.934
One thousand dollars!
The Bundys win!

20:21.734 --> 20:23.533
We won! We won!

20:23.567 --> 20:25.733
Peg! Peg, where are you?

20:25.767 --> 20:27.166
Where are you, Peg?

20:27.200 --> 20:28.166
I'm comin', Al.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.433
I'm comin'.

20:29.467 --> 20:31.900
Gangway!

20:33.100 --> 20:34.900
No, Peg, no! It's over!

20:34.934 --> 20:36.934
Well, I married her.

20:42.934 --> 20:45.934
<i>Well, throw another city
on the barbie, eh, God?</i>

20:45.968 --> 20:49.066
<i>It's 112, so please remember
to crack the window</i>

20:49.100 --> 20:51.834
<i>when you leave Grandma
in the car.</i>

20:52.567 --> 20:54.066
Oh, this is the life,
isn't it?

20:54.100 --> 20:55.133
Mm-hmm.

20:55.167 --> 20:57.266
<i>Food and
an air conditioner.</i>

20:57.300 --> 20:59.966
Well, your father finally
came through for us.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.500
So when's Daddy gonna be
able to enjoy all this?

21:02.534 --> 21:03.733
Well, I don't know.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.266
The doctor says that cool air

21:05.300 --> 21:07.900
isn't really good
for an exposed liver.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.266
But don't worry,
Daddy's happy in his pool.

21:10.300 --> 21:14.001
And I just brought him
a nice cool drink.
