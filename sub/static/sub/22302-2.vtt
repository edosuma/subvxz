00:14.347 --> 00:16.975
I don't know if I'll be able to...

00:20.311 --> 00:23.732
tell this history
or be precise in English.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.317
But...

00:31.740 --> 00:35.869
in my dark time...

00:35.952 --> 00:39.664
one day I took a very strong...

00:39.748 --> 00:40.874
acid.

00:44.419 --> 00:50.049
<i>And during that trip,</i>
<i>I understood the meaning of life.</i>

00:54.304 --> 00:56.639
<i>But, of course, the trip ended</i>

00:57.348 --> 01:00.185
<i>and my knowledge disappeared.</i>

01:00.268 --> 01:03.855
<i>And the question</i>
<i>"What is the meaning of life?"</i>

01:03.938 --> 01:06.524
<i>was annoying me.</i>

01:08.568 --> 01:10.528
<i>One night, I had a dream.</i>

01:15.408 --> 01:17.911
<i>I was walking in the street</i>

01:17.994 --> 01:21.539
<i>like a kid who has</i>
<i>the hands of the father and mother,</i>

01:21.623 --> 01:23.917
<i>someone bigger guiding you.</i>

01:26.544 --> 01:30.882
<i>And I was asking to this big person,</i>
<i>"What was the meaning of life?"</i>

01:31.883 --> 01:36.054
<i>He showed me circles.</i>
<i>Circles of life.</i>

01:38.515 --> 01:40.725
<i>And then he showed me a flower.</i>

01:43.728 --> 01:44.813
<i>Why?</i>

01:45.605 --> 01:47.398
<i>A plant has a circle.</i>

01:49.818 --> 01:52.904
<i>A seed becomes a plant</i>
<i>that has a flower,</i>

01:52.987 --> 01:56.032
<i>transforms into a fruit.</i>
<i>The fruit drops.</i>

01:56.116 --> 01:57.117
<i>There's another seed...</i>

01:58.576 --> 02:01.579
<i>and the seed grows again.</i>
<i>This is a circle.</i>

02:04.415 --> 02:06.042
<i>And I said,</i>

02:06.126 --> 02:09.045
<i>"I see. I understand.</i>
<i>But why did you show me the flower?"</i>

02:10.922 --> 02:14.050
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>"The flower is the moment that we live,</i>

02:14.134 --> 02:17.428
<i>the most beautiful moment of the circle.</i>

02:18.221 --> 02:20.431
<i>The most beautiful moment.</i>

02:21.683 --> 02:22.976
<i>Contemplate this."</i>

03:50.980 --> 03:55.526
<i>Twenty years ago,</i>
<i>eating out in São Paulo</i>

03:55.610 --> 03:58.613
<i>meant going to a French</i>
<i>or Italian restaurant.</i>

04:00.698 --> 04:03.743
Going to a good restaurant
was something for the wealthy.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.081
It wasn't widespread,
because people ate mainly at home.

04:08.164 --> 04:11.042
Rice, beans, farofa and steak.

04:13.002 --> 04:16.339
<i>Maybe Brazilians didn't want to think</i>
<i>of their cuisine as restaurant food,</i>

04:16.422 --> 04:21.511
<i>as a cuisine that has gastronomic value,</i>

04:21.594 --> 04:24.931
<i>a cuisine worthy</i>
<i>of the ritual of dressing up,</i>

04:25.014 --> 04:27.809
<i>getting ready and going out to eat.</i>

04:27.892 --> 04:30.061
<i>Alex Atala appeared,</i>

04:30.144 --> 04:33.648
<i>bringing the possibility of a more</i>
<i>modern Brazilian cuisine.</i>

05:17.483 --> 05:19.319
<i>He's a hunter and angler.</i>

05:19.402 --> 05:23.072
<i>He knows nature.</i>
<i>He knows the jungle.</i>

05:30.121 --> 05:31.622
<i>He went to the Amazon.</i>

05:31.706 --> 05:36.919
<i>He noticed that Amazonic ingredients</i>
<i>were very different from what people knew</i>

05:37.003 --> 05:40.631
<i>in Brazil and abroad.</i>

05:43.509 --> 05:48.181
<i>By combining this Amazonian background</i>
<i>and his jungle knowledge</i>

05:48.264 --> 05:50.892
<i>with classic French techniques,</i>

05:50.975 --> 05:54.020
<i>and also being open</i>
<i>to the European avant-garde,</i>

05:54.062 --> 05:58.107
<i>he made a mix that became</i>
<i>a very strong personal message.</i>

06:16.125 --> 06:19.337
<i>From the moment he realized</i>
<i>he needed to be a Brazilian chef,</i>

06:19.420 --> 06:21.964
<i>and that D.O.M. had the potential</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:24.634
<i>to be the first great</i>
<i>modern Brazilian restaurant,</i>

06:25.384 --> 06:29.138
<i>he managed to find his place</i>
<i>in the 21st century.</i>

06:31.265 --> 06:35.853
<i>He is the international ambassador</i>
<i>of Brazilian cuisine.</i>

06:57.333 --> 06:59.293
Do you have a piece of wood?

06:59.377 --> 07:01.003
Yeah. Yeah.

07:36.539 --> 07:41.836
Here you go.
The entire duck skin for you to use.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.800
-Thank you.
-Thank you, too.

07:52.763 --> 07:56.601
<i>Behind every dish there is death.</i>

07:56.684 --> 08:00.563
<i>And people only close</i>
<i>their own eyes to it.</i>

08:27.256 --> 08:29.592
<i>One of my first memories</i>

08:30.760 --> 08:35.515
<i>to taste and also cook,</i>
<i>was with my father and my grandfather.</i>

08:40.353 --> 08:41.979
<i>In the old days, as a kid,</i>

08:42.063 --> 08:44.649
<i>we used to travel</i>
<i>to remote areas in Brazil</i>

08:44.732 --> 08:49.529
<i>and go fishing and hunting in Amazonas,</i>
<i>Pantanal, Atlantic Rainforest...</i>

08:53.741 --> 08:59.413
<i>And it was mandatory,</i>
<i>if you kill a fish, if you kill something,</i>

08:59.497 --> 09:03.042
<i>to clean the fish</i>
<i>and eat the whole entire animal.</i>

09:04.710 --> 09:06.712
<i>It didn't matter what we killed.</i>

09:10.341 --> 09:14.136
<i>This was maybe</i>
<i>my first relation with food,</i>

09:14.679 --> 09:16.514
<i>and cooking as well.</i>

09:17.598 --> 09:19.433
<i>It was a way to respect...</i>

09:20.560 --> 09:21.644
<i>that life,</i>

09:22.562 --> 09:24.188
<i>and teach...</i>

09:25.106 --> 09:28.734
<i>how we might respect</i>
<i>the natural environment</i>

09:28.818 --> 09:30.903
<i>and just take what we need to eat.</i>

09:32.029 --> 09:33.823
<i>We are not God.</i>

09:33.906 --> 09:38.911
<i>We are a tiny, tiny, tiny part...</i>
<i>of nature.</i>

10:19.452 --> 10:20.995
Amazing.

10:24.999 --> 10:29.211
Alex, do you know this?
It's known as mint of cabocio.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.255
No, I don't know it.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.675
It is from the same family as the mint,
and the aroma is great.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.427
-Piperaceae.
-Piperaceae.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.680
Amazing. Piperaceae.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.560
What would it go well with?

10:44.644 --> 10:48.773
It's sweet.
This could pair with anything.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.233
-It's an amazing ingredient.
-Let's pick some.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.745
Palmito juçara.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.499
This will make the heart of palm
grow bigger.

11:06.582 --> 11:11.295
This species is very important.
I am happy to see heart of palm here.

12:28.247 --> 12:33.878
<i>Since my childhood,</i>
<i>the possibility to enjoy nature,</i>

12:33.961 --> 12:36.380
<i>this has always fascinated me.</i>

12:38.841 --> 12:44.054
<i>Appreciating every single leaf,</i>
<i>insect, or a bird, or a fish...</i>

12:47.516 --> 12:48.809
<i>Going to Amazonas,</i>

12:48.893 --> 12:52.229
<i>it is something that comes</i>
<i>deep from my heart.</i>

12:57.568 --> 13:00.362
But everybody who loves Amazonas,
who enjoys Amazonas,

13:00.446 --> 13:03.574
who has been to the Amazonas,
is afraid about the future.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.160
Amazonas is under a huge pressure.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.331
<i>We need to understand</i>

13:10.414 --> 13:15.628
<i>the way that we have been</i>
<i>producing food in South America and Brazil</i>

13:15.711 --> 13:18.506
<i>is sterilizing entire ecosystems.</i>

13:21.258 --> 13:22.801
<i>But indigenous people,</i>

13:22.885 --> 13:26.764
<i>they have been living</i>
<i>in the Amazonas for years.</i>

13:26.847 --> 13:29.475
<i>Centuries.</i>
<i>And they still have a balance.</i>

13:30.309 --> 13:34.313
<i>Natural conservation,</i>
<i>preservation of Amazonas is not only</i>

13:34.396 --> 13:38.359
<i>protecting the river,</i>
<i>or the sea, or the forest.</i>

13:38.442 --> 13:40.819
It is protecting the men who live inside.

13:42.363 --> 13:46.617
<i>And I do believe that</i>
<i>we can learn something from them.</i>

14:02.049 --> 14:04.260
Manaus! Amazonas! Brazil!

14:04.343 --> 14:07.096
This is where it's at.
Game over.

14:14.520 --> 14:19.108
<i>I remember very well</i>
<i>my first taste of caviar.</i>

14:19.191 --> 14:22.278
I said, "I don't know if that's good."

14:24.905 --> 14:28.784
<i>I remember very well</i>
<i>the first day that I tasted tucupi,</i>

14:28.868 --> 14:30.870
<i>the juice of manioc flour.</i>

14:31.871 --> 14:37.918
And I said, "Wow. This is a new flavor.
I don't know if I like it."

14:39.253 --> 14:44.592
<i>But if caviar is fancy,</i>
<i>and tucupi is not fancy,</i>

14:44.675 --> 14:47.177
<i>it's just because someone told me.</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:50.306
There's a cultural interpretation
of flavors.

14:59.023 --> 15:04.153
<i>Eating insects for our culture</i>
<i>is something not good.</i>

15:05.195 --> 15:09.450
<i>It's linked with misery...</i>
<i>with hunger and starving.</i>

15:09.533 --> 15:12.661
<i>A few years ago, I went to Amazonas,</i>

15:12.745 --> 15:18.292
<i>and I was introduced to the best chef</i>
<i>in a tiny village,</i>

15:18.375 --> 15:21.879
an indigenous woman called Dona Brazi.

15:25.925 --> 15:31.597
<i>And she did a dark sauce</i>
<i>with lots of ants inside.</i>

15:35.351 --> 15:40.105
She gave it to me and I said,
"Wow. Lots of ants."

15:42.650 --> 15:46.320
<i>So I took the spoon,</i>
<i>and I just take the dark sauce.</i>

15:46.403 --> 15:49.740
I tasted the dark sauce,
and it was beautiful.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.826
<i>A beautiful aroma of ginger</i>
<i>and lemongrass.</i>

15:52.910 --> 15:57.122
<i>And I know that in Amazonas</i>
<i>we don't have lemongrass and ginger.</i>

15:58.457 --> 16:03.003
So I ask Dona Brazi,
"What kind of herb did you put inside?"

16:03.087 --> 16:04.380
And she said, "Ants."

16:05.297 --> 16:08.300
I said, "Okay, I can see the ants.
But there's an herb."

16:08.384 --> 16:09.593
<i>And she said, "Ants."</i>

16:09.677 --> 16:14.264
And I repeated the question,
and she said, "Stop. Taste the ants."

16:14.348 --> 16:15.432
I taste the ants,

16:15.516 --> 16:19.603
and the aroma of ginger
and lemongrass was really strong.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.899
It exploded in my mouth, and I said,
"Wow! This is something new."

16:59.518 --> 17:03.814
<i>I'm born and raised in a workers' area.</i>
<i>It's part of São Paulo.</i>

17:05.274 --> 17:09.862
<i>My father used to work</i>
<i>in the rubber industry</i>

17:09.945 --> 17:12.072
<i>and my mother used to be a seamstress.</i>

17:15.993 --> 17:20.706
<i>My mother and my father</i>
<i>have black hair and dark skin.</i>

17:20.789 --> 17:23.667
<i>My three brothers have</i>
<i>black hair and dark skin.</i>

17:23.751 --> 17:28.922
And for some reason, I was born
slim, white, with a ginger head.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.842
<i>Nobody was like this.</i>

17:31.925 --> 17:33.927
<i>I was the different guy.</i>

17:34.845 --> 17:36.221
<i>I felt alone.</i>

17:38.474 --> 17:41.935
<i>I was trying to understand myself.</i>

17:49.193 --> 17:52.488
<i>I always loved music.</i>
<i>I've always loved rock and roll.</i>

17:52.988 --> 17:55.866
In that time, "hippies" are super trendy,

17:55.949 --> 17:59.912
but I didn't identify really myself
with the hippies.

18:03.457 --> 18:08.295
<i>And one day, I went to a concert,</i>
<i>and that was a punk rock band.</i>

18:11.423 --> 18:16.470
I saw the people and said,
"Wow, this is so cool."

18:16.553 --> 18:19.181
A few of them had ginger hair.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.974
I'm born like this!

18:24.895 --> 18:29.024
<i>I became completely fascinated.</i>
<i>I said, "This is what I want to be."</i>

18:30.400 --> 18:32.986
<i>At that time, I was 14, almost 15.</i>

18:33.821 --> 18:35.030
<i>I was angry.</i>

18:36.657 --> 18:40.828
I decided to leave my family house,
live on my own...

18:41.537 --> 18:43.914
<i>and I started to work in a club.</i>

18:46.959 --> 18:50.879
<i>As a young guy living on my own,</i>
<i>making my own money,</i>

18:50.963 --> 18:54.049
<i>I could do whatever I wanted.</i>

18:54.133 --> 18:58.846
Drugs, sex, everything I wanted to have,
I could... like this.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.936
<i>Drugs are not forbidden</i>
<i>because they are bad,</i>

19:06.937 --> 19:09.106
drugs are forbidden
because they are good...

19:10.023 --> 19:11.733
but fuck you.

19:13.694 --> 19:17.489
<i>So I went maybe too deep in drugs.</i>

19:18.407 --> 19:21.285
<i>And I did bad things.</i>

19:22.578 --> 19:24.538
<i>This is my dark time.</i>

19:27.416 --> 19:30.043
<i>I was not against nothing...</i>

19:33.463 --> 19:35.591
<i>but I was looking for something.</i>

19:58.280 --> 20:03.702
<i>In 2003, I decided to buy a farm</i>
<i>up north in Amazonas.</i>

20:04.453 --> 20:08.457
<i>That was a crazy idea,</i>
<i>but I decided I want to help people there.</i>

20:10.834 --> 20:15.589
<i>If I start producing tucupi</i>
<i>and sell it in my restaurant,</i>

20:15.672 --> 20:19.176
<i>I can make more money,</i>
<i>and so I can pay more local people.</i>

20:19.259 --> 20:20.928
<i>Everybody gonna be happy.</i>

20:21.887 --> 20:25.515
I was feeling myself...

20:25.599 --> 20:28.352
the fucking clever guy.

20:28.435 --> 20:31.063
<i>I could save Amazonas in that moment.</i>

20:31.146 --> 20:33.899
<i>So I decided to send food for them.</i>

20:35.025 --> 20:37.527
<i>And I went back after six months...</i>

20:39.321 --> 20:44.034
and what I saw was plastic bags...

20:44.993 --> 20:47.746
and cans everywhere.

20:47.829 --> 20:50.374
<i>And I became upset.</i>

20:51.833 --> 20:56.922
<i>And I started to explain to them,</i>
<i>"How can they do this?"</i>

20:57.005 --> 20:59.383
<i>And they became really upset with me.</i>

20:59.466 --> 21:01.218
<i>And we had a big argument.</i>

21:01.301 --> 21:04.846
And one of the oldest men
from this community faced me

21:04.930 --> 21:06.932
and put the finger to my nose and said,

21:07.015 --> 21:11.561
"Alex, this is your fault.
Packaging of fish is a scale.

21:11.645 --> 21:15.983
Packaging of vegetables is skin.
I throw away."

21:16.066 --> 21:22.572
<i>In that moment, I realized who was sending</i>
<i>plastic and cans to them.</i>

21:23.282 --> 21:24.324
<i>Me.</i>

21:25.117 --> 21:28.453
<i>And I started to feel very bad.</i>

21:28.537 --> 21:31.957
Maybe even worse, ignorant.

21:37.504 --> 21:42.217
<i>This was the key to build</i>
<i>a project called ATA.</i>

21:43.927 --> 21:48.557
"Ata" <i>means fire in one of our</i>
<i>native languages, which is Guaraní.</i>

21:49.891 --> 21:54.855
<i>ATA's mantra is to understand better</i>
<i>our relation with food.</i>

21:55.939 --> 22:00.027
Food chain, in this moment,
can be a very powerful weapon

22:00.110 --> 22:03.155
to support natural conservation.

22:23.550 --> 22:27.888
<i>The Baniwa people,</i>
<i>they have more than 70 varieties of chili.</i>

22:31.850 --> 22:34.186
<i>The chili is very meaningful</i>
<i>for the Baniwa people.</i>

22:34.895 --> 22:39.566
<i>Under their own tradition,</i>
<i>when a young girl gets married...</i>

22:39.649 --> 22:43.653
<i>the first gift from her mother</i>
<i>is chili seeds.</i>

22:44.654 --> 22:49.534
<i>And they plant, and they harvest</i>
<i>without over-pressuring nature.</i>

22:56.124 --> 22:58.752
<i>But it's important to understand...</i>

22:59.878 --> 23:04.174
<i>nowadays, women work planting food,</i>
<i>and men work in...</i>

23:04.257 --> 23:08.512
not so good activities,
like illegal mining,

23:08.595 --> 23:11.431
<i>because they didn't have jobs.</i>

23:11.515 --> 23:15.143
<i>And mining takes them</i>
<i>far from their families.</i>

23:15.936 --> 23:19.606
<i>So our first project was the chili powder.</i>

23:24.486 --> 23:28.990
<i>We have built small houses</i>
<i>to process the chili.</i>

23:29.074 --> 23:32.035
<i>We have five already working.</i>

23:32.119 --> 23:34.246
<i>We are building two more.</i>

23:35.288 --> 23:38.708
<i>One of the preparations</i>
<i>that they have with the chili</i>

23:38.792 --> 23:40.210
<i>they call jiquitaia.</i>

23:41.419 --> 23:44.172
<i>Jiquitaia is a variety of chilis, dried.</i>

23:45.382 --> 23:47.217
<i>It's delicious.</i>

23:47.300 --> 23:50.137
<i>We use it in many different ways in D.O.M.</i>

23:50.220 --> 23:54.891
I think it gives us an advantage.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.226
The pepper is ours.

23:56.309 --> 24:00.522
It is part of our culture,
and it can never be taken away.

24:00.605 --> 24:05.986
<i>Our thought was to find something</i>
<i>we could bring to São Paulo,</i>

24:06.069 --> 24:08.280
<i>and spread a little bit more</i>
<i>their culture,</i>

24:08.363 --> 24:11.908
<i>and give economic opportunity</i>
<i>to the Baniwa tribes,</i>

24:11.992 --> 24:14.661
<i>and support natural conservation.</i>

24:29.843 --> 24:32.721
<i>I remember I was working in a club.</i>

24:32.804 --> 24:35.182
<i>Fascinated by punk rock,</i>

24:35.265 --> 24:40.520
<i>I started to think, "How was the life,</i>
<i>the punk rock life, in Europe?"</i>

24:44.733 --> 24:49.029
<i>So I save a little money,</i>
<i>and one day, I decided to make my dream.</i>

24:49.112 --> 24:52.991
Go to Europe and see and live.

24:53.074 --> 24:55.327
That culture that was fascinating me.

24:56.828 --> 25:00.916
<i>From my very first step in Europe,</i>
<i>I was living a dream.</i>

25:02.250 --> 25:06.588
<i>Everything was new,</i>
<i>and I decided not to go back to Brazil.</i>

25:08.506 --> 25:10.800
<i>But, in that time, I had two problems.</i>

25:10.884 --> 25:14.471
<i>First one, make money.</i>
<i>So I start to work painting walls.</i>

25:15.013 --> 25:17.432
<i>And the second, get a visa.</i>

25:19.100 --> 25:22.938
One of the guys who was painting walls
was doing chef school.

25:23.855 --> 25:27.025
I said, "Nice way to have a visa."

25:27.108 --> 25:28.944
<i>So I went to chef school.</i>

25:29.861 --> 25:31.738
<i>To be clear...</i>

25:31.821 --> 25:33.406
I didn't decide to be a chef.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.786
My visa pushed me to be a chef.

25:38.954 --> 25:43.583
<i>Can you imagine, the end of '80s,</i>
<i>Brazilian guy, punk rocker...</i>

25:43.667 --> 25:46.503
in a French, or Belgian,
or Italian kitchen?

25:49.214 --> 25:51.049
<i>It wasn't easy at all.</i>

25:52.217 --> 25:54.511
<i>But because of my family background,</i>

25:54.594 --> 25:57.305
<i>I knew how to pluck a bird</i>
<i>or clean a fish.</i>

25:57.389 --> 25:59.724
<i>This is something</i>
<i>that I had been doing as a kid.</i>

26:00.600 --> 26:03.770
And it was much more fun
working as a chef...

26:04.729 --> 26:06.481
than painting walls.

26:07.941 --> 26:13.738
<i>Year by year, I started to fall in love</i>
<i>with this profession.</i>

26:49.482 --> 26:52.277
All this work just to get the scale off.

26:54.904 --> 26:56.406
Fuck.

26:56.489 --> 26:59.159
It's a hard pirarucu fish.

27:11.838 --> 27:15.425
Careful with your hand.
The knife is moving fast.

27:27.687 --> 27:31.232
I can only imagine the sensation
of fishing one of these out of the water.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.151
One? I have three at home.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.103
<i>When we are training to be a chef...</i>

28:09.062 --> 28:12.524
<i>we learn that the most important moments</i>

28:13.108 --> 28:16.194
<i>of our day will be mise en place,</i>

28:17.737 --> 28:19.656
<i>prepping all the ingredients...</i>

28:20.782 --> 28:23.159
<i>to make an amazing dish.</i>

28:24.744 --> 28:27.872
There is a Brazilian chef
called Roberta Sudbrack,

28:27.956 --> 28:31.126
and she used to say something that I love.

28:31.209 --> 28:34.170
"Our mise en place
doesn't start in the kitchen.

28:35.422 --> 28:39.134
It starts on the farm and in nature."

28:42.929 --> 28:47.892
<i>If we want to do delicious food,</i>
<i>we need amazing ingredients.</i>

28:47.976 --> 28:52.397
<i>To find those ingredients,</i>
<i>we need to find another person</i>

28:52.480 --> 28:55.734
<i>who loves that ingredient</i>
<i>as much as I love it.</i>

28:57.736 --> 29:00.113
<i>About ten years ago,</i>
<i>I was working in the restaurant,</i>

29:00.196 --> 29:04.033
<i>and someone said,</i>
<i>"Alex, there's a guy outside</i>

29:04.117 --> 29:06.661
<i>who wants to talk with you about rice."</i>

29:12.625 --> 29:15.044
<i>And he said, "Please, can you taste this?</i>

29:15.128 --> 29:18.256
<i>We are producing a new variety of rice."</i>

29:19.090 --> 29:20.675
And that was the black rice.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.761
Is this black rice?

29:22.844 --> 29:28.057
Yes, this is its flower.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.976
How beautiful.

29:30.059 --> 29:32.729
When they decided to plant black rice,

29:32.812 --> 29:36.816
<i>people started to laugh</i>
<i>and said, "Those guys are nuts.</i>

29:36.900 --> 29:38.735
<i>They are planting black rice</i>

29:38.818 --> 29:42.280
<i>in a country where everybody</i>
<i>only eats white rice."</i>

29:43.615 --> 29:47.452
I saw it and said,
"Wow, this is beautiful. Let's cook it!"

29:49.370 --> 29:51.581
<i>And we cooked it,</i>
<i>and the taste was incredible.</i>

29:53.333 --> 29:56.836
We started to use it,
and they became a kind of...

29:57.754 --> 30:01.132
inspirational model for other producers.

30:13.436 --> 30:19.067
This one has some plastic on top
to make it easier for us to open it.

30:20.568 --> 30:24.656
<i>We have more than</i>
<i>300 different types of bees in Brazil.</i>

30:24.739 --> 30:25.907
<i>The honey's beautiful.</i>

30:28.076 --> 30:30.036
<i>Tastes are completely different.</i>

30:30.119 --> 30:35.041
<i>But in Brazil we only use European honey</i>
<i>because the water level is quite low,</i>

30:35.124 --> 30:37.418
<i>so it's a stable ingredient.</i>

30:37.502 --> 30:42.966
But our honey is a live ingredient,
as alive as... wine and cheese,

30:43.049 --> 30:47.011
so fermentation happens
and acidity comes up.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.013
<i>So you have a beautiful balance</i>

30:49.097 --> 30:52.308
<i>between flavor, aroma,</i>
<i>acidity, and sweetness.</i>

30:52.392 --> 30:57.272
You will taste an acid taste
because of the fermentation.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.190
The taste is sensational.

30:59.274 --> 31:01.734
<i>There are many ingredients like this</i>

31:01.818 --> 31:04.362
<i>that, as Brazilians,</i>
<i>we should be proud of.</i>

31:04.445 --> 31:05.655
To the bees.

31:05.738 --> 31:09.617
<i>They are beautiful, and natural,</i>
<i>and native to Brazil.</i>

31:11.119 --> 31:12.871
<i>A chef can be a leader.</i>

31:12.954 --> 31:14.372
<i>Looking for ingredients,</i>

31:15.206 --> 31:16.457
<i>connecting people,</i>

31:16.541 --> 31:19.669
<i>it is the way to build</i>
<i>a better food chain.</i>

31:31.055 --> 31:33.641
<i>So after chef school,</i>

31:33.725 --> 31:37.103
<i>I was living in Italy</i>
<i>with a Brazilian girl called Cristiana.</i>

31:37.937 --> 31:39.689
<i>I was working in a kitchen.</i>

31:41.274 --> 31:43.818
<i>And Cristiana got pregnant.</i>

31:46.279 --> 31:48.031
<i>We are living in Milano.</i>

31:48.948 --> 31:50.909
<i>It's an amazing city.</i>

31:51.784 --> 31:53.244
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

31:53.328 --> 31:56.581
But it's not home.
It's not me.

31:57.415 --> 32:00.043
<i>Living in Europe made me realize...</i>

32:01.961 --> 32:03.713
<i>I don't want to have an Italian son.</i>

32:04.422 --> 32:06.925
<i>I want to have a Brazilian son.</i>

32:07.759 --> 32:10.845
<i>My background, my origin, my culture.</i>

32:11.429 --> 32:16.809
<i>Living in Brazil, it is my reality.</i>
<i>It is my soul. It is my truth.</i>

32:18.728 --> 32:21.105
<i>So we decided to go back to Brazil.</i>

32:22.023 --> 32:25.068
We went to the beach,
and I entered with him,

32:25.151 --> 32:28.905
with this tiny, tiny, tiny boy
in the sea.

32:31.699 --> 32:34.160
<i>This is an important thing for me.</i>

32:34.243 --> 32:36.204
<i>My kids need to touch the ground,</i>

32:36.287 --> 32:40.291
<i>recognize the salt of the sea</i>
<i>or the sweetness of the Amazon.</i>

32:41.459 --> 32:44.545
This is part of my life.
This is...

32:44.629 --> 32:46.673
<i>This is stronger than me.</i>

33:11.280 --> 33:15.535
<i>The most meaningful ingredient</i>
<i>from Amazonas is cassava.</i>

33:17.745 --> 33:21.874
<i>Some people call it yuca.</i>
<i>For us Brazilians, mandioca.</i>

33:21.958 --> 33:25.044
<i>In English, manioc.</i>
<i>It is the same ingredient.</i>

33:26.671 --> 33:32.593
<i>The only single ingredient you can find</i>
<i>in all social classes,</i>

33:32.677 --> 33:35.596
<i>the richest and the poorest, is manioc.</i>

33:36.723 --> 33:40.226
<i>Under Brazilian tradition,</i>
<i>what we do is peel it...</i>

33:41.853 --> 33:43.229
grate it...

33:45.440 --> 33:46.816
<i>press.</i>

33:47.775 --> 33:54.198
<i>When you press, a kind of milk comes out</i>
<i>and the starch comes down.</i>

33:56.409 --> 34:01.998
<i>In our native language,</i>
<i>the starch of manioc is called tapioca.</i>

34:02.999 --> 34:06.377
<i>It's funny because the whole entire world,</i>
<i>even in Brazil...</i>

34:08.046 --> 34:12.508
<i>when thinking about tapioca,</i>
<i>suppose that it is Asiatic.</i>

34:14.719 --> 34:16.888
<i>No.</i>
<i>Tapioca is Brazilian.</i>

34:21.601 --> 34:22.602
With salt.

34:22.685 --> 34:24.854
It's good with salt, right?

34:24.979 --> 34:28.357
<i>We have tapioca and we have the juice.</i>

34:28.441 --> 34:30.860
<i>Fermented, it becomes tucupi.</i>

34:30.943 --> 34:33.696
<i>The pulp becomes manioc flour.</i>

34:34.280 --> 34:37.742
It takes a while to roast
and to get it right when is very dry.

34:37.825 --> 34:39.327
But it is looking pretty.

34:39.410 --> 34:44.624
<i>With those three products,</i>
<i>we can start designing many dishes.</i>

34:52.799 --> 34:58.221
<i>I do believe that</i>
<i>I need to keep my eyes open,</i>

34:58.304 --> 35:01.057
<i>ears open, heart open, mind open...</i>

35:01.140 --> 35:05.770
<i>Learning from nature,</i>
<i>local people, the natives...</i>

35:07.313 --> 35:09.774
<i>This is what keeps pushing me.</i>

35:45.017 --> 35:48.563
<i>So I left Europe</i>
<i>and I went back to Brazil,</i>

35:48.604 --> 35:53.609
<i>and I started to work in kitchens</i>
<i>in fine dining places.</i>

35:53.693 --> 35:56.028
<i>And having a tattoo was not so good.</i>

35:56.112 --> 35:59.365
<i>In Brazil and everywhere,</i>
<i>it was shameful.</i>

35:59.448 --> 36:01.617
<i>So I started to work covered.</i>

36:01.701 --> 36:03.911
<i>I was not showing my tattoos.</i>

36:06.038 --> 36:10.710
<i>In that time, important chefs</i>
<i>and important restaurants in Brazil</i>

36:10.793 --> 36:15.173
<i>were only serving</i>
<i>Italian and French cuisine.</i>

36:15.256 --> 36:18.134
<i>French chefs were the gods in Brazil.</i>

36:19.135 --> 36:22.597
<i>Nobody was really interested</i>
<i>in Brazilian cuisine.</i>

36:23.514 --> 36:26.976
<i>We have a kind of inferiority complex.</i>

36:31.355 --> 36:34.901
<i>So I received a proposition</i>
<i>to work in a new place.</i>

36:34.984 --> 36:38.362
<i>Italian cuisine, very focused on pasta.</i>

36:41.115 --> 36:47.455
<i>But I knew that that food was not as good</i>
<i>as the same recipe tasted in Italy.</i>

36:49.040 --> 36:52.126
<i>It was a very bad adaptation.</i>

36:52.210 --> 36:54.420
<i>The food had no soul.</i>

36:56.297 --> 37:00.176
<i>After four years,</i>
<i>I was working in a French restaurant.</i>

37:03.137 --> 37:06.974
<i>I met a French chef called Erick Jacquin.</i>

37:07.058 --> 37:13.522
<i>One day we were working in the kitchen,</i>
<i>doing a very classical French cuisine.</i>

37:14.440 --> 37:16.609
<i>Erick called me and said,</i>
<i>"Alex, sit with me.</i>

37:16.692 --> 37:20.446
<i>You are a good chef.</i>
<i>You know how to achieve the flavor.</i>

37:20.529 --> 37:23.824
<i>But you're never gonna make French food</i>
<i>as good as I do."</i>

37:23.908 --> 37:27.203
We were talking about
a cultural background.

37:28.621 --> 37:31.123
<i>And I became upset.</i>

37:33.292 --> 37:35.086
<i>I felt very bad.</i>

37:37.922 --> 37:41.217
<i>I went back home</i>
<i>and I took off my T-shirt,</i>

37:41.300 --> 37:43.386
<i>and I looked in the mirror and said,</i>

37:43.469 --> 37:48.307
<i>"I'm a tattooed man. I am an outsider.</i>
<i>I am Brazilian."</i>

37:50.268 --> 37:51.686
<i>This is who I am.</i>

37:51.769 --> 37:55.856
<i>If I was different,</i>
<i>I wanted to be different.</i>

37:56.983 --> 38:01.696
<i>If I'm not able to make a French dinner</i>
<i>as good as a French chef,</i>

38:01.779 --> 38:07.493
nobody could do a better Brazilian dinner
or a Brazilian experience than me.

38:11.205 --> 38:14.959
<i>So I started to switch some ingredients.</i>

38:15.042 --> 38:19.547
<i>I took flounder and I served it</i>
<i>with a passion fruit farofa.</i>

38:19.630 --> 38:21.465
<i>And people loved the dish.</i>

38:22.049 --> 38:23.718
<i>That was my moment.</i>

38:23.801 --> 38:29.223
<i>And I decided to make my own restaurant,</i>
<i>which is D.O.M.</i>

38:29.807 --> 38:34.312
<i>And I decided to cook only something</i>
<i>that comes deep from my heart...</i>

38:34.395 --> 38:36.272
<i>Brazilian cuisine.</i>

39:07.887 --> 39:14.018
When people come to D.O.M.,
we propose to them a Brazilian experience.

39:18.814 --> 39:24.653
<i>So every single detail, music,</i>
<i>decoration, architecture...</i>

39:24.737 --> 39:26.113
It is Brazil.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.250
<i>The menu at D.O.M.</i>

39:38.334 --> 39:43.839
<i>takes you on a journey</i>
<i>through Brazilian cuisine.</i>

39:44.590 --> 39:46.300
<i>People who go to D.O.M.</i>

39:46.384 --> 39:51.180
<i>have to be open</i>
<i>to seeing Brazilian products</i>

39:51.263 --> 39:53.849
<i>treated as delicacies.</i>

39:54.725 --> 39:57.853
<i>Our chef's suggestion for lunch time</i>

39:57.937 --> 40:02.858
since the very first day of D.O.M.
is Workers' Food.

40:04.276 --> 40:09.490
<i>The chef has managed to be subversive.</i>

40:09.573 --> 40:12.910
<i>He managed to make the elite</i>
<i>eat rice and beans.</i>

40:12.993 --> 40:16.831
<i>But the presentation is so sophisticated</i>
<i>and done with context,</i>

40:16.914 --> 40:19.792
<i>people feel authorized to like it.</i>

40:19.875 --> 40:22.420
They don't need to be ashamed
of liking it.

40:25.506 --> 40:29.218
<i>It is not necessary</i>
<i>to use expensive ingredients.</i>

40:29.802 --> 40:32.596
The luxury is in your hands,
in your ability.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.224
<i>This is luxury.</i>

40:35.307 --> 40:40.563
<i>The human capacity to transform</i>
<i>something into emotions.</i>

40:43.441 --> 40:46.902
<i>There are surprises,</i>
<i>provocations, ruptures.</i>

40:46.986 --> 40:51.574
So it's not a completely safe experience

40:51.657 --> 40:54.410
like it would be
at a traditional restaurant.

40:55.202 --> 40:58.289
<i>The idea is to challenge people...</i>

41:00.040 --> 41:02.751
<i>make them feel slightly uncomfortable.</i>

41:04.336 --> 41:06.589
When I serve something that you say,

41:06.672 --> 41:09.258
"I don't think that I'll like this,"
or, "It's so weird..."

41:12.720 --> 41:14.930
<i>This strange feeling</i>

41:15.014 --> 41:20.644
<i>is what makes us push the boundaries</i>
<i>of what it means to be a Brazilian.</i>

41:21.353 --> 41:25.191
<i>This is to push you</i>
<i>to the edge of flavors.</i>

41:26.233 --> 41:28.777
We don't do that to be delicious.

41:28.861 --> 41:30.696
We do that to be "Wow!"

41:47.546 --> 41:51.008
<i>When I opened D.O.M.,</i>
<i>a young Brazilian chef</i>

41:51.091 --> 41:54.178
<i>using Brazilian ingredients,</i>
<i>doing Brazilian cuisine,</i>

41:54.261 --> 41:57.848
people started to think,
"Alex, you're crazy."

41:59.016 --> 42:01.644
<i>The very beginning was not easy at all.</i>

42:02.937 --> 42:04.688
<i>The first years of D.O.M...</i>

42:05.606 --> 42:09.193
<i>nobody, really nobody, came to D.O.M.</i>

42:11.654 --> 42:13.989
<i>People didn't respect Brazilian cuisine.</i>

42:16.534 --> 42:18.661
<i>It was a tough moment in my life.</i>

42:20.037 --> 42:22.164
<i>But, I was really believing...</i>

42:23.165 --> 42:28.837
<i>So, in 2005, I decided to go</i>
<i>to Madrid, Spain...</i>

42:28.921 --> 42:31.715
for a chefs' conference
called Madrid Fusión.

42:43.435 --> 42:49.149
<i>I said, "Okay, what message</i>
<i>can I pass to European people</i>

42:49.233 --> 42:53.153
<i>from a young chef</i>
<i>who works with Brazilian ingredients?"</i>

42:56.198 --> 43:00.578
<i>So I started to think,</i>
<i>"What is the flavor from Amazonas?"</i>

43:01.328 --> 43:08.252
<i>I decided to show</i>
<i>a concept that I call Amazonic terroir.</i>

43:09.086 --> 43:13.674
<i>I knew that everybody knew hearts of palm,</i>
<i>but just in cans.</i>

43:13.757 --> 43:18.220
<i>Fresh hearts of palm was</i>
<i>something really new for them.</i>

43:19.013 --> 43:22.725
<i>I took a kind of log</i>
<i>and with a big knife, cleaned it</i>

43:22.808 --> 43:26.729
<i>and showed this beautiful,</i>
<i>white heart of palm.</i>

43:27.563 --> 43:31.692
<i>I was claiming something Brazilian.</i>

43:31.775 --> 43:33.861
<i>People were fascinated.</i>

43:33.944 --> 43:37.072
<i>Ferran Adrià comes up to the stage.</i>

43:50.794 --> 43:53.922
<i>A mythical chef</i>
<i>on my stage during my demo.</i>

43:54.006 --> 43:56.133
<i>I became so proud.</i>

43:56.216 --> 43:59.386
That was the turning point
of my professional life.

44:06.185 --> 44:09.688
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>in Brazilian cuisine, chef Alex Atala</i>

44:09.772 --> 44:11.899
started to play
an important role internationally.

44:14.693 --> 44:18.447
<i>All of this helped Brazilians</i>
<i>feel pride in their own culture.</i>

44:19.448 --> 44:23.327
<i>I left Brazil</i>
<i>with a kind of shame to be Brazilian.</i>

44:23.410 --> 44:24.828
<i>And I went back to Brazil</i>

44:24.912 --> 44:29.750
<i>much more Brazilian than I ever</i>
<i>could have imagined in my life.</i>

44:49.144 --> 44:51.814
<i>Today, he has an important presence</i>

44:51.897 --> 44:56.443
<i>speaking out for farmers,</i>
<i>landowners, craftsmen...</i>

45:02.533 --> 45:05.869
<i>He's speaking out politically,</i>

45:05.953 --> 45:09.456
<i>so that people can create</i>
<i>a more productive food chain.</i>

45:15.879 --> 45:21.218
<i>I don't think that all chefs</i>
<i>must go to the forest or deep in the sea</i>

45:21.301 --> 45:23.720
<i>to understand the ingredient better.</i>

45:25.180 --> 45:28.392
That was my truth.
This was my way.

45:37.317 --> 45:40.696
So I start to understand
the whole chain of food...

45:46.535 --> 45:49.163
<i>is not only the inside of the kitchen.</i>

45:50.956 --> 45:55.002
<i>It is where and how</i>
<i>this food has been produced.</i>

45:57.212 --> 45:58.755
<i>This is the circle.</i>

46:14.396 --> 46:16.815
<i>When I was a young guy,</i>

46:16.899 --> 46:20.694
<i>I was just trying</i>
<i>to understand myself better.</i>

46:22.070 --> 46:24.198
<i>But I was looking for something.</i>

46:25.824 --> 46:28.076
<i>And at 47 years old...</i>

46:28.994 --> 46:31.747
<i>I'm still looking for the same.</i>

46:32.456 --> 46:37.753
<i>Now I'm trying to put focus</i>
<i>and all of this energy that I still have,</i>

46:37.836 --> 46:43.342
these emotions, these feelings,
this anger...

46:44.760 --> 46:50.599
<i>to show to Brazil that Brazilian cuisine</i>
<i>is a possible dream,</i>

46:51.517 --> 46:55.479
<i>to show to the world the Brazilian soul.</i>

47:02.903 --> 47:06.365
<i>And I believe that exchange,</i>

47:06.448 --> 47:10.160
<i>learning, being open, it is...</i>

47:11.161 --> 47:12.371
<i>it is the key.</i>

47:17.125 --> 47:20.379
<i>In the old days,</i>
<i>when we were punk rockers,</i>

47:20.462 --> 47:22.548
<i>we used to carry a pen or something,</i>

47:22.631 --> 47:26.093
<i>or a spray, and painting everywhere</i>
<i>"punk rock."</i>

47:32.683 --> 47:38.647
<i>I really liked to make a drawing</i>
<i>of a crazy punk rocker.</i>

47:41.567 --> 47:44.111
<i>A very angry guy.</i>

47:46.196 --> 47:52.035
<i>Years and years later,</i>
<i>I was writing my first cookbook.</i>

47:52.119 --> 47:56.748
I said, "Fuck, I was a punk
and I became a chef."

48:00.377 --> 48:02.004
<i>This is life.</i>

48:02.087 --> 48:04.256
<i>And I started to draw</i>

48:04.339 --> 48:07.217
<i>the same things I used to draw</i>
<i>when I was a punk rocker,</i>

48:07.301 --> 48:10.846
<i>but instead I drew</i>
<i>a happy, happy, happy chef.</i>

48:14.975 --> 48:16.476
<i>This is the circle.</i>

48:22.024 --> 48:23.609
<i>This is my life.</i>
