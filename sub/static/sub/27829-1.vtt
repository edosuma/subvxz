03:04.642 --> 03:06.727
There you go. No, I'm

03:06.728 --> 03:08.229
I just rattle to the ground.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.898
Like your head?

03:12.192 --> 03:13.817
Yeah, pretty much like the head.
Like a light.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.987
Whoa, man. That is
a hot cup a tea.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.199
Good job, buddy.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.660
Never enough wood
cutting, though.

03:28.833 --> 03:32.669
Jesus.
Me back is shot.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.504
Pay for that one in the morning.

03:34.505 --> 03:35.923
Shoulda took a break earlier.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.758
Put that in the back.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.676
Shoulda had me on the
saw, ya cripple.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.012
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.889
Put it in the back,
b'y, behind the seat.

03:43.890 --> 03:44.349
Wha?

03:44.349 --> 03:45.349
Behind the seat.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.060
Are we good to go then, or wha?

03:48.061 --> 03:50.687
Yes by. Just havin'

03:50.688 --> 03:52.689
Right on. Listen, thanks for

03:52.690 --> 03:55.692
And if you need some help now,
in the next couple a weeks,

03:55.693 --> 03:58.528
hauling yours down, I can
give you a hand, you know.

03:58.529 --> 04:01.531
Just picking away at it. I haven't
really burned through much yet.

04:01.532 --> 04:02.533
Good b'y.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.702
Alright then, buddy.
Have a good week.

04:05.703 --> 04:06.787
Yes, you too, Jer.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.705
Yessir, man.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.373
Is Emma back?

04:09.374 --> 04:13.043
Myself and the young fella are goin' in
to pick her up in a few days, I dare say.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.045
Right on.

04:15.046 --> 04:18.464
Listen, want a few
turrs, or what?

04:18.466 --> 04:19.925
Always.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.552
Myself and the brother-in-law got
a couple a dozen last week or so.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.805
I'll drop some down to you.
You gonna be around?

04:24.806 --> 04:25.889
Yes, I'll be around.

04:25.890 --> 04:26.890
Right on.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.561
Alright b'y.
Take'er easy buddy.

04:31.562 --> 04:34.482
Yes, you too. Say hi
to the missus for me.

05:31.122 --> 05:34.958
Jesus, I'm
dyin' here with the heat.

05:34.959 --> 05:35.959
Yeah?

05:37.628 --> 05:39.880
Was I telling you I got
my moose license?

05:39.881 --> 05:42.800
Yeah? Out yet?

05:43.801 --> 05:45.469
No, never got a chance yet.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.137
Get out soon, now before
the season closes.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.139
Should be fine, shouldn't it?

05:49.140 --> 05:51.975
Job to say. They're a bit
skittish this time of year.

05:51.976 --> 05:54.144
It's gonna be hard
to get close to 'em.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.063
We should go out now, soon.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.066
My area's not far from
here. We'll go out for the day.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.693
Yeah, for sure.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.655
What's your license for?

06:05.656 --> 06:09.493
Bull. Well, bull or a calf.
But I never takes a calf.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.911
Really? What's wrong
with a calf?

06:10.912 --> 06:12.829
Nothing wrong with a calf.

06:12.830 --> 06:15.540
I took one, one time,
thinking it was a cow.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.042
I snuck right up on it.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.544
She didn't know I was
in the world.

06:19.545 --> 06:24.508
After I shot 'er, I realized -
wasn't scared of nuttin' yet.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.510
Fuck it. I'd take it anyway.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.595
Meat is meat. As long as
the freezer's full.

06:28.596 --> 06:31.848
I s'pose. Broke me
heart, that's all.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.851
Yeah, I always wanted to go with
Dad when I was a kid-

06:34.852 --> 06:36.186
Up seal hunting.

06:36.187 --> 06:40.065
But I thought I'd feel
too bad doing it.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.067
Plus mudder'd kill me
if she knew.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.195
My mudder was the same way.

06:44.862 --> 06:48.532
My father used to go out at it,
though. Every spring.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.411
He come back this one time,
though, with seal hand.

06:51.744 --> 06:55.872
That's when the b'ys are gutting' the seals
and they cuts their hands up with the knife.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.583
And the blood and the blubber
and stuff gets in the cuts.

06:58.584 --> 06:59.709
Causes infection.

06:59.710 --> 07:02.964
Dirty old stuff.
Could kill ya.

07:03.714 --> 07:04.549
Jesus.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.967
Yeah.
I never went at it myself.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.094
Who knows? Maybe I'll
end up on the Mainland.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.430
No seal in sight.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.232
Christ b'y. You'd be better
off with the rot.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.603
It's Emma's idea, sure.
Maybe just for the summer.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.898
I know. I know.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.901
By the way, now.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.237
You coming to town with me
on Thursday to pick up Emma?

07:27.238 --> 07:29.656
After she's finished
her test or whatever?

07:29.657 --> 07:31.908
I might be working.
I'll see.

07:31.909 --> 07:34.078
Alright then, b'y.
Let me know, alright?

07:34.912 --> 07:36.497
Here, la. Take this.

07:36.914 --> 07:37.748
No, no.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.583
Don't be at it
b'y. I got my job.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.252
No. For giving
me a hand today.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.170
Here.

07:42.171 --> 07:43.753
I didn't come here
to get paid, b'y.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.589
I don't care. Don't
you be so silly.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.007
Here. Give it to
your mudder.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.676
She won't take it from
me anyway.

07:48.926 --> 07:49.926
Later.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.930
-Alright.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.228
Nobody knows how to take
out that garbage, or what?

09:22.311 --> 09:23.353
Shush, Dad.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.855
I coulda swore that I
showed you how to take out-

09:25.856 --> 09:27.023
Dad. Stop.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.776
How are you, honey?

09:30.695 --> 09:31.362
You got everything?

09:31.362 --> 09:32.362
Yeah.

09:50.881 --> 09:51.924
That was good?

09:53.384 --> 09:54.884
You want a piece of pie?

09:54.885 --> 09:56.886
William's mother sent
one over yesterday.

09:56.887 --> 09:59.431
No. I'm good.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.309
I had him out cutting
wood the other day.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.768
He's pretty good at it too.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.062
He's a good worker
when he wants to be.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.897
He didn't mention it.

10:07.898 --> 10:10.233
He didn't cut his leg off
or anything, did he?

10:10.234 --> 10:12.945
No. He's the best kind, sure.
Seemed to really enjoy himself.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.073
Sure, you and he goes in the
woods, all the time, don't you?

10:17.074 --> 10:19.743
Yeah, but we only go for walks.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.911
We don't go hunting or fishing
or anything like that.

10:21.912 --> 10:25.081
I think he said his dad used to
do stuff like that, though.

10:25.082 --> 10:27.459
But he was too young
to be at it.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.294
Yeah?

10:28.295 --> 10:30.087
I'll make a
woodsman out of him yet.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.841
I'd figure you'd be over there like
a bullet, soon as we pulled up.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.426
I don't know.

10:36.427 --> 10:40.097
I haven't been talking to him much
this past week with my exams and stuff.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.308
Is that it?

10:42.475 --> 10:43.643
Yeah.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.437
He's rotted at me because I
wanna go away for the summer.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.481
It's only to Halifax
or something.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.775
It's not like he
can't come with me.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.778
I don't know, honey. You
got to talk to the poor fella.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.112
He's fine.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.114
I think there's people getting
together on Saturday at Kelly's.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.283
So I'm sure I'll see him there.

11:00.284 --> 11:01.785
Are we going to Nan's Saturday?

11:01.786 --> 11:04.120
No, I told her I'd take you
over Sunday morning.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.290
Rather than being across
the highway Saturday night.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.795
Come on. I know you want to.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.004
I'm gonna go watch some TV.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.341
Are you sure you don't wanna
help me skin brace of rabbits?

11:16.342 --> 11:18.844
I would rather not.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.807
Throw the kettle on for me,
will you, my luv? Please?

11:52.253 --> 11:54.003
You all right, then?

11:54.004 --> 11:55.380
Yup.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.174
You don't seem it.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.720
I'm fine.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.929
Alright.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.348
You were barely there an hour
before you wants to go.

12:05.349 --> 12:08.393
You hardly even talked to me
the whole night anyway.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.521
There was a lot of people
to see. I don't know.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.273
I haven't seen you
for three months.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.191
I knew it.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.192
What?

12:15.193 --> 12:16.860
I knew you were gonna
get on with this.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.195
You're the one who flipped
out at me on the phone.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.030
I didn't flip out.

12:20.031 --> 12:21.865
You ignored my calls for a week.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.409
I had to hear from you dad
that you were coming home.

12:24.410 --> 12:28.037
Had to beg you to see me, and
now you won't every talk to me.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.539
Why wouldn't I get on with it?

12:29.540 --> 12:30.540
You're being a fucking idiot!

12:30.541 --> 12:32.417
My son, you better get
under fuckin' control

12:32.418 --> 12:34.294
before she has the fuckin'
harbour woke up.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.296
Christ man, I almost
took a run at yay.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.297
Yes, I'm sure.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.048
How are ya b'y?

12:39.049 --> 12:39.967
Alright.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.468
Me younger brother, Robbie.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.886
What are y'at?

12:42.887 --> 12:44.137
William.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.555
What are you fellas out making a
racket for tonight, anyway?

12:45.556 --> 12:47.891
B'ys, this is Emma.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.602
I used to know Michael
from high school.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.771
Emma who?

12:52.229 --> 12:53.438
Whelan.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.639
Your fadder Paddy Whelan, den?

12:55.900 --> 12:56.901
Yeah.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.068
A real arsehole.

12:59.069 --> 12:59.987
What's that?

12:59.988 --> 13:01.446
Our fadder knew her
fadder quite well.

13:01.447 --> 13:05.325
I was just tell 'em that
he was an arsehole.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.495
I s'pose after the pen, you'd know are
arsehole better than anybody, b'y?

13:08.914 --> 13:10.247
That's alright.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.250
Well, getting on now.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.085
Heading back home
from Kelly's thing.

13:16.086 --> 13:19.589
I s'pose my invitation
was lost in the mail.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.091
I'm sure he didn't ever know
you were around, honestly.

13:22.092 --> 13:25.428
Well don't worry about it, b'y. Was up
with the cousins for a spell anyway.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.931
Trying to get this queer
on the hard drink for once.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.265
Frig off!

13:29.266 --> 13:31.018
Alright.
Heading on, now.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.937
Where to?

13:33.938 --> 13:36.524
Bringing the missus home
before she's froze, yeah?

13:39.360 --> 13:43.029
i can't believe you're fuckin' chasing
skirts from up the fuckin' way.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.614
Couldn't get your tail
around here, did ya?

13:44.615 --> 13:48.451
Had to go fuckin' chasing the skirt
down to the other end of the harbour?

13:48.452 --> 13:49.370
No need for that.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.287
Take a joke, b'y.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.622
Didn't sound like
a fuckin' joke.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.457
Come on. Let's just go.
Come on.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.458
You should listen to her.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.128
She might be rotten. But
she sounds half smart.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.504
Fuck you.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.131
Right on.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.580
You fuckin' walk that bitch home
while you still got time.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.388
You're right tough now,
after HMP, are ya?

14:08.389 --> 14:11.892
I think all them inbred pussies from
up the shore got you turned soft.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.355
Fuck!

14:19.066 --> 14:20.484
Get off him!

14:21.318 --> 14:23.487
Get off! Jesus!

14:25.698 --> 14:27.491
Get off of him!

14:28.534 --> 14:29.576
Get off of him!

14:29.577 --> 14:30.995
Get off!

15:45.486 --> 15:46.570
Emma!

15:48.113 --> 15:50.073
Come on.
Get your arse in gear.

15:50.074 --> 15:53.577
Your grandmudder 'll have me
crucified if we're late this morning!

15:59.083 --> 16:01.585
Emma?

16:20.437 --> 16:21.605
Emma?

16:28.529 --> 16:29.529
Honey.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.622
Jesus Christ! I'm gonna beat the
face right off that little shit.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.540
No. Dad! Stop!

16:39.541 --> 16:40.624
No! I'm not gonna stop!

16:40.666 --> 16:43.668
Stop. It wasn't Will!
Dad! It wasn't Will. Okay?

16:43.669 --> 16:45.670
Listen to me. I wasn't Will.
Jesus!

16:45.671 --> 16:47.839
It was a couple of b'ys
that Will knows.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.800
We were just walking home form
Kelly's and they started up on us.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.802
What do you mean,
started up with ya?

16:52.803 --> 16:55.305
They just started saying
shit to Will about me.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.640
Going out with me, or whatever.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.474
Anyway, one of them
started fighting Will.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.310
And I tried to break it up.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.061
Where were you to?

17:02.062 --> 17:04.480
We were just over to Riverhead
coming back from Kelly's.

17:04.481 --> 17:05.732
And?

17:05.733 --> 17:09.152
And what? I came home! I mean,
Dad, it's not a big deal, okay.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.862
It's just a bruise.
I'm not hurt.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.488
Who were they?

17:12.489 --> 17:14.490
Winsor brothers?
I think?

17:14.491 --> 17:15.575
Where are you going?

17:15.576 --> 17:16.492
Jesus Christ!

17:16.493 --> 17:17.661
Dad! Stop it! Dad!

17:55.616 --> 17:56.616
What the hell?

17:57.034 --> 17:58.534
Arh! Fuck b'y!

17:58.535 --> 18:00.870
You likes hurting women, do ya?

18:00.871 --> 18:02.872
Fuck off! Hold off before
you're fuckin' crippled.

18:02.873 --> 18:06.709
I hears tell that either one of you
lay a fuckin' hand on one of them-

18:06.710 --> 18:07.794
I'll chop 'er right off.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.878
İs that so?

18:08.879 --> 18:11.631
Yeah, it is! If you so much
as fuckin' look at 'er.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.216
You're her fadder then?

18:13.217 --> 18:16.220
If she keeps to her own crowd, there
won't be any problems, now will there?

18:16.303 --> 18:16.637
Yeah really?

18:16.638 --> 18:18.387
Yeah!

18:18.388 --> 18:20.765
You can take your little fuckin' brudder,
and you fly the fuck out of it, somewhere.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.725
I'm fuckin' warning you.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.227
Yeah? What are you gonna do?

18:23.310 --> 18:24.727
Back off!

18:24.728 --> 18:27.563
Your fuckin' breed. Your poor
mudder's be sick at the sight of this.

18:27.564 --> 18:28.398
You deaf b'y?

18:28.399 --> 18:30.316
I said go home out of it.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.317
This is me fuckin' home.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.904
We're not in your shitty
little cove now, b'y.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.572
You don't come around here
telling people what to do.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.741
Throwing punches around without
any sort of consequences.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.576
You done enough of that
for one lifetime.

18:40.577 --> 18:41.577
This is fuckin' nonsense.

18:41.578 --> 18:42.496
What nonsense?

18:42.497 --> 18:43.973
The same nonsense your
old man got on with.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.748
Shoulda know ye'd
take after him.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.917
You stay clear this side of
Riverhead. You hear me?

18:47.918 --> 18:50.753
If I sees you around here again,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill ya.

18:50.754 --> 18:51.463
Yeah?

18:51.463 --> 18:51.922
Yeah.

18:51.922 --> 18:52.589
What about Will?

18:52.673 --> 18:54.258
I don't mind that piece a shit.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.426
But right now you best make
yourself scarce.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.137
I'll do what I fuckin'
well likes.

18:59.138 --> 19:03.432
If I sees you around here again, I'm gonna
send you back to your cove in a wooden coat.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.268
That's a promise.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.102
Yeah.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.603
You're a big fuckin'
man, you are.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.445
Get in the car.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.459
Fuckin' asshole.

20:27.893 --> 20:28.893
Cocksucker!

20:29.686 --> 20:30.686
Jeez! I can't
fuckin' believe that!

20:30.687 --> 20:31.605
It's fine, b'y.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.064
It's not fine! It's
not fuckin' fine.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.024
Calm down.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.775
This fuckin' fella
comes right to our door.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.360
Hauls me out, for fuck sake's.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.362
That's low, man.
That's fuckin' low.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.404
Just forget about it.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.782
We showed him how it was.
He'll take the hint.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.534
He's too fuckin' thick to get
out of his own way, now.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.203
I dunno. He-

20:46.204 --> 20:47.704
That's right. You don't know.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.414
The fuckin' crowd out here, man.

20:50.415 --> 20:54.919
Some fuckin' retard down from the arse end of
the shore comes down and tells me what to do?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.712
You better believe I'm
gonna be fuckin' rotted.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.923
He's frightened half to death,
b'y. It'll be fine.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.550
Are you serious?

21:01.969 --> 21:03.886
Since when do you give a shit about
Paddy, or anybody from the Cove?

21:03.887 --> 21:05.805
What? You got buddies
up there now, or what?

21:05.806 --> 21:08.933
Stop it! I just means you got
better things to be at, is all.

21:08.934 --> 21:12.436
Drunks. On the fuckin' dole,
every one of 'em.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.438
Jesus, always kicking
up a racket.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.401
You saw it just now, sure.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.737
You don't remember our fadder.

21:21.738 --> 21:25.074
Paddy and those fuckin' Micks are the
reason you and me are half orphaned.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.910
Don't you fuckin' forget it.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.750
We ought to put the fear in 'em.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.753
Make him realize he should keep
to himself out of it.

21:37.754 --> 21:40.299
Let him know he beat on the
wrong fuckin' door.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.761
Come on.

21:54.104 --> 21:58.775
Yeah.

22:00.110 --> 22:03.613
Okay. I think he's there now.
So I'll call you back, alright?

22:03.947 --> 22:04.947
Okay. Bye.

22:12.956 --> 22:16.000
Nan just called. She want's to
know when we're coming up.

22:16.001 --> 22:19.338
Give her a call back. Tell
her we're on the way, okay?

22:22.007 --> 22:23.133
What happened, then?

22:24.551 --> 22:26.635
Nothing, honey. It's fine.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.179
Just call your grandmother back.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.182
And I'll warm up
the truck, okay?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.894
Okay. Hey, can we see
Will on the way there?

22:34.478 --> 22:35.811
We're late as it is.

22:35.812 --> 22:38.565
I'll drop you off at his mother's
on the way back, alright?

24:14.077 --> 24:15.912
I'm gonna drop
you off here, okay?

24:16.079 --> 24:18.998
I thought you said you
were gonna take me over to Wills.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.250
- I will. I'm just gonna
check something off first.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.751
I won't be long.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.004
- Nothing's even open.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.133
- I went down to see those two
little shits this morning.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.010
- What the hell,
Dad! Why?

24:31.011 --> 24:33.596
Are you kidding? You know
friggin' well why.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.014
-Well you coulda told me.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.600
-I didn't know what else to do.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.019
I said it wasn't a
big deal, Dad.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.938
Well it's a big
goddamned deal to me.

24:44.774 --> 24:45.941
This is bullshit.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.151
Watch your mouth.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.777
You don't know these fellas.

24:48.778 --> 24:50.613
You're making me look foolish.

24:50.614 --> 24:52.781
I told you, I can
take care of myself.

24:52.782 --> 24:54.617
Real well, by the
looks of your face.

24:54.618 --> 24:55.618
Thank you.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.786
Look, there's nothing
foolish about it, honey.

24:57.787 --> 24:59.498
You're my daughter, aren't ya?

25:00.624 --> 25:03.792
We takes care of our own.

25:03.793 --> 25:05.294
Those guys said that
they knew you.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.547
Or that their dad did,
or something?

25:07.964 --> 25:08.632
Yeah.

25:08.632 --> 25:09.632
And?

25:10.300 --> 25:11.801
He was just as bad as they were.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.637
Instigating.
Starting fights.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.639
With fellas from our
end of the Cove.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.643
After school. After a hockey
game. Whenever.

25:20.143 --> 25:24.146
Ended up in prison up the
Mainland. Got himself killed.

25:24.147 --> 25:26.149
Tangled up with the
wrong crowd, I s'pose.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.321
Yeah, he got shipped off.

25:32.322 --> 25:35.992
And this racket we were all
tangled up in was laid to rest.

25:36.826 --> 25:37.826
More or less.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.330
People likes to pretend
it never happened.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.165
I can't say I blame 'em.

25:43.166 --> 25:46.169
Better than fighting
flat out all the time.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.756
Okay. Fine.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.216
Bye.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.296
Fuck sakes!

27:12.964 --> 27:14.173
Careful now, old man.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.425
- I only had it give
up for a year.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.761
You wouldn't know but I
had virgin lungs again.

27:18.762 --> 27:19.762
- Sounds like it.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.472
- Fuck, it's nothing
but shit at the pen.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.973
I figured I'd wait it out.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.351
- Should give it up all
together now, b'y.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.270
- Yeah, well, nobody said
I was sensible.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.312
- Nope.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.438
- You saucy bastard.

27:29.439 --> 27:32.316
- Give 'em to me if you're
not gonna smoke 'em.

27:32.317 --> 27:35.111
- Yes. Fuck sakes.
Charity case.

27:37.822 --> 27:40.825
Still good to go around for
a poke, then, or what?

27:42.118 --> 27:45.454
Still good to go around for
a poke, then, or what?

27:45.455 --> 27:47.790
I'll tuck you in, my son,
don't you worry.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.124
Now gimme them keys.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.960
Fuck off.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.337
B'y we're just gonna go give
'em a good scare, like.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.215
Frighten the shit
right out of 'em.

27:56.132 --> 27:57.841
What if we gets caught?

27:57.842 --> 27:59.218
You fuckin' wimp, man.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.969
This fuckin' fella comes
to our door, right?

28:00.970 --> 28:03.972
Fuckin' hauls me out on the lawn
and punches me in the face.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.141
And you're over there sookin'
like a woman over nudding?

28:06.142 --> 28:07.309
That's not what I meant.

28:07.310 --> 28:10.146
It is what you meant.
You're always fuckin' like it.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.981
Friggin' breed out here, man.

28:12.982 --> 28:17.528
Just build a wall.
Keep to yourself.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.864
Can you remember that year they stopped
having that big Boxing Day parade?

28:20.865 --> 28:22.991
Father was right in
the middle of the street.

28:22.992 --> 28:24.868
Making a big fuckin'
racket about it.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.161
Uncle Roy was there too.

28:26.162 --> 28:29.039
And a bunch fuckin' Micks from
up the fuckin' way come down.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.500
Caused a big old fuss.
Blocked off the street.

28:31.501 --> 28:34.003
A fuckin' shit show.
Place went up.

28:34.170 --> 28:38.508
Fuckin' Paddy was there with a
whole crew of b'ys form the Cove.

28:39.008 --> 28:40.926
Some friggin sight.

28:40.927 --> 28:43.011
I remember seeing
Fadder that morning.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.347
Gettin' hauled off.

28:45.014 --> 28:49.184
Paddy? Paddy got
to keep on livin'.

28:49.185 --> 28:52.896
It's not fit man.
Not fuckin' fit.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.191
Now gimmie the fuckin' keys.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.268
You droppin' into the house?

30:13.269 --> 30:14.687
No, mudder wants me home.

30:17.607 --> 30:18.858
-She don't mind.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.638
Jesus!

30:49.639 --> 30:52.516
Come on. Das it! Let's go!
Let's get outta this.

30:52.517 --> 30:53.642
Come on.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.395
Wait!

30:59.023 --> 31:00.483
Get in the truck!

31:03.695 --> 31:05.864

31:18.668 --> 31:21.170
Help! Somebody!

31:22.547 --> 31:24.172
Jesus Christ, Mick!

31:24.173 --> 31:25.340

You fuckin' hit 'em! You fuckin'
dropped em! Is he dead?

31:28.595 --> 31:30.721
Is he fucking dead?

31:30.722 --> 31:32.932
Jesus b'y! Calm down
and shut up!

32:15.141 --> 32:16.600
First Sorrowful Mystery.

32:16.601 --> 32:17.809
The Agony in the Garden.

Hail Mary full of grace.
The Lord is with Thee.

32:56.641 --> 32:57.600
Blessed art Thou among women.

32:57.601 --> 32:59.810
And blessed is the fruit of
Thy womb, Jesus.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.770
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.438
Now and at the hour
of our death, Amen.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.279
Hail Mary full of grace.
The Lord is with Thee.

33:05.316 --> 33:06.275
Blessed art Thou among women.

33:06.276 --> 33:08.151
And blessed is the fruit of
Thy womb, Jesus.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.112
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.780
Now and at the hour of
our death, Amen.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.199
Hail Mary full of grace.
The Lord is with Thee.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.159
Blessed art Thou among women.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.119
And blessed is the fruit of
Thy womb, Jesus.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.121
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.790
Now and at the hour of
our death, Amen.

33:32.301 --> 33:34.470
Are you gonna come out?

33:38.474 --> 33:42.145
I'm sure it would mean a
lot to Paula if you did.

33:48.359 --> 33:51.153
You can be mad at me
all you like.

33:51.154 --> 33:53.740
But there'll be a time that
you'll regret not coming out.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.840
Let me grab my jacket, Paula.
I'll give you a ride home.

34:11.841 --> 34:12.841
No, no. It's okay.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.342
Are you sure? I don't mind.

34:14.342 --> 34:15.719
No, no. Really,
I'd rather walk.

34:15.719 --> 34:18.847
Get a bit of fresh air.
Might do me a bit of good.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.349
If you say so.

34:21.851 --> 34:25.520
You should let me pack up some of
that food for you, now, for later.

34:25.521 --> 34:27.607
No, Paddy.
Don't be so foolish.

34:28.357 --> 34:30.358
You keep all that for yourself.

34:30.359 --> 34:32.735
I'm trying to fatten you
up for the winter.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.114
You done so much now, as it is.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.908
I've hardly done enough.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.909
Will was like family to me.

34:39.911 --> 34:43.081
I wouldn't have treated
one of my own any better.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.542
How's Emma making out, then?

34:46.876 --> 34:48.543
She'll be okay.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.420
Poor thing.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.425
You know, I don't know if I'd feel any
better if they end up catching who did it.

34:55.426 --> 34:58.386
Especially if it's
a familiar face.

34:58.387 --> 35:01.890
What the Jesus am I supposed to
think when I sees their family?

35:01.891 --> 35:04.559
I'll be thinking that I
just had to bury my boy.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.270
And I couldn't even
open his casket.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.565
You should let me give
you a ride home.

35:10.566 --> 35:12.568
You'll catch you death
of cold, me love.

35:16.906 --> 35:19.324
Do you remember growing up?

35:19.325 --> 35:22.745
The way they used to display the
caskets right out in the living room?

35:24.247 --> 35:26.582
It scared me at first,
when I was little.

35:27.500 --> 35:31.253
But after I lost Mom,
I realized I liked it.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.588
It was like I was saying
goodbye to somebody.

35:33.589 --> 35:36.175
Like I was sending them
off on a trip.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.346
I wish I coulda done that today.

38:23.509 --> 38:24.510
[Knock on door}

38:25.094 --> 38:26.595
What is it?

38:26.637 --> 38:28.764
You're wanted at the door.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.141
Who is it?

38:31.475 --> 38:32.767
Cops.

38:32.768 --> 38:35.478
Jesus b'y. Tell
'em I'm not home.

38:35.479 --> 38:36.980
What's you tell 'em?

38:36.981 --> 38:38.773
I'm not gonna lie to the cops.

38:38.774 --> 38:40.859
Just go talk to them.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.445
You're lucky we're blood.

39:37.208 --> 39:37.833
Hey Burt!

39:37.834 --> 39:39.585
I wanted to talk to you.

39:41.003 --> 39:42.670
I know.
I got your calls, Paddy.

39:42.671 --> 39:45.507
But I told you. I can't say
anything about any of it.

39:45.508 --> 39:48.927
I know. I'm just getting a real bad
taste off of all this, you know.

39:48.928 --> 39:52.514
B'y a young fella shot
dead in the street.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.016
It's gotta be the only way
it tastes. Sad truth.

39:55.017 --> 39:56.851
Well, listen. I wanted to
tell you earlier-

39:56.852 --> 39:58.520
Will wasn't caught
up in anything bad.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.688
Or nudding like that.

40:00.689 --> 40:01.856
He was a good kid.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.233
There's nothing like
that going on.

40:03.234 --> 40:06.069
It's just a bunch of lies
going around, that's all.

40:06.070 --> 40:09.448
The last thing we needs now, is a
town divided down the middle again.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.032
Yeah, you're right.

40:11.033 --> 40:13.118
But don't bother with it,
Paddy, I'm telling you.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.702
Young Mike, there,
the other day-

40:14.703 --> 40:16.204
Jesus, give it up b'y.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.873
You gotta let it breathe.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.876
That little shit was threatening
to put me six feet under.

40:21.877 --> 40:24.546
He had a goddamned rifle
pointed at me and everything.

40:24.547 --> 40:26.048
Look!

40:26.215 --> 40:27.883
Paddy, put that away.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.970
Look, I'm sure these fellas got
a real romance in their heads

40:31.971 --> 40:34.055
about all the shit their
father got on with.

40:34.056 --> 40:35.140
All of that.

40:35.141 --> 40:38.726
Divisions. It's all about
divisions with this crowd.

40:38.727 --> 40:40.438
Pack a garbage, the lot of it.

40:42.064 --> 40:44.232
They don't have a friggin' clue what
went on between me and their old man.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.734
And you knows goddamned
well, Burt. Come on!

40:46.735 --> 40:49.070
That's my goddamned
point, Paddy.

40:49.071 --> 40:51.239
Mick Winsor got a real hate
for you on principle.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.575
Doesn't matter what you
an his father were at.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.994
Look. The younger fella got a
moose license the year, right?

40:55.995 --> 40:57.579
What am I supposed to do?

40:57.580 --> 40:59.747
Go up and arrest him because
he own's a rifle?

40:59.748 --> 41:02.584
Lord Jesus, half the young
fellas on the shore got a rifle.

41:02.585 --> 41:03.918
You got a rifle, don't ya?

41:03.919 --> 41:04.420
Yeah.

41:04.421 --> 41:05.920
Yeah. Same size, right?

41:05.921 --> 41:07.255
Yeah.

41:07.256 --> 41:10.176
Yeah, well the more you pokes
around, the worse it's gonna get.

41:10.676 --> 41:13.596
Because it's god-blessed
tense now, as it is.

41:14.221 --> 41:17.640
Just let us all do our jobs.

41:17.641 --> 41:21.603
Unless he got a rifle barrel shoved down
your throat, I got better things to be at.

41:21.604 --> 41:22.771
Stop rocking' the boat.

41:24.940 --> 41:26.941
Little shit! He's the spit of
his fucking fadder!

41:26.942 --> 41:27.942
Jesus Paddy!

41:28.777 --> 41:30.111
Do you remember how much
of a nuisance you were?

41:30.112 --> 41:31.489
Smarten up, b'y.

41:32.656 --> 41:35.116
You remember when his old
man got shipped off?

41:35.117 --> 41:36.784
-Yeah.

41:36.785 --> 41:39.120
Well, you're lucky he didn't open your
god damned throat right here in the road.

41:39.121 --> 41:41.164
And you're lucky he didn't
make it back home.

41:41.165 --> 41:43.625
'Cause he probably woulda
tried it all over again.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.169
Now you keep out of trouble.

41:46.795 --> 41:50.798
Jesus Christ. Whether you think that this
crowd had anything to do with it or not-

41:50.799 --> 41:52.884
They're not the ones to
shag with, right?

41:52.885 --> 41:55.637
You look after Emma.
Focus on her.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.556
I'll focus on all this.

42:00.142 --> 42:01.185
Okay, Burt.

42:06.690 --> 42:07.816
Paddy, I'm sorry.

42:08.692 --> 42:09.985
About Will.

42:11.195 --> 42:12.738
Jesus, about everything.

43:22.141 --> 43:23.934
There you are.

43:30.065 --> 43:33.319
I dropped by to see Paula today.
See how she's doing.

43:35.446 --> 43:39.157
She sent you over
a whack of stuff.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.910
She must have been baking
all week over there.

43:42.244 --> 43:44.747
That's good, though,
to keep herself occupied.

43:54.423 --> 43:56.634
Have you been by to see her yet?

43:58.761 --> 44:00.762
No. Not yet.

44:00.763 --> 44:03.306
Emma, That's a sin. She'd love
to see you, you know.

44:03.307 --> 44:05.309
She's going through a hard time.

44:06.101 --> 44:07.436
We all are.

44:08.103 --> 44:09.104
Look at me!

44:10.105 --> 44:11.105
What?

44:11.774 --> 44:13.317
What have you been
doing all day?

44:13.984 --> 44:17.820
Nothing really.
I tried to read my book.

44:17.821 --> 44:19.365
Couldn't really focus on it.

44:20.282 --> 44:22.116
I can see how you woulda
got preoccupied.

44:22.117 --> 44:25.953
Forgot to put a
light on or put a junk it.

44:25.954 --> 44:27.206
Wait. Wait.

44:28.457 --> 44:32.127
Look, I feel like you've hardly
said two words to me all week.

44:32.461 --> 44:34.296
I'm not in the mood, okay?

44:34.797 --> 44:36.006
I know.

44:36.799 --> 44:38.801
i just wanna
know that you're okay.

44:40.135 --> 44:42.011
I'm not.

44:42.012 --> 44:43.389
You know what I mean.

44:43.806 --> 44:44.223
Yes.

44:44.224 --> 44:46.141
And I'm not.

44:47.309 --> 44:51.312
I'll put supper on, then, and
throw a junk in, I s'pose.

44:51.313 --> 44:53.147
I'm not hungry.

44:53.148 --> 44:55.818
No? Of course you're not.

46:10.058 --> 46:11.226
Morning Luv.
Burt around?

46:13.228 --> 46:14.228
No?

46:15.063 --> 46:16.565
Okay, I'll try him there then.

46:18.317 --> 46:19.318
Yes, thanks. You too.

46:30.954 --> 46:34.333
Yeah Burt. Paddy Whelan
here. How are you?

46:35.250 --> 46:37.127
Yeah, I'm alright b'y.

46:38.921 --> 46:42.924
Yeah, the missus was saying you
were up and gone early this morning.

46:42.925 --> 46:44.467
Right on, b'y.
I won't keep you.

46:44.468 --> 46:47.428
I was just wondering if you found
anything about the Doyle boy.

46:47.429 --> 46:49.347
Yeah, yeah. I know.
I knows.

46:49.348 --> 46:52.476
It's just that - a lot of people
talk and everything, you know Burt.

46:52.976 --> 46:54.353
Bye.

47:00.943 --> 47:04.029
B'y, Will's not caught up
in anything. Listen.

47:04.363 --> 47:08.366
The young one - Michael Winsor.
The oldest fella. Yeah.

47:08.367 --> 47:09.951
It can't be a coincidence, b'y.

47:09.952 --> 47:13.454
And the fellas from his end of town,
now, getting on with all kinds of shit.

47:13.455 --> 47:16.999
Making him out to be some
kind of saint or something.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.545
I bet he's still got that rifle in the
trunk of the car, for Christ's sake.

47:20.546 --> 47:22.631
At least look into it, alright?

47:23.298 --> 47:24.842
Alright, yeah.

47:25.008 --> 47:26.301
I'll be around.

47:26.468 --> 47:28.135
Fuck sakes.

47:28.136 --> 47:29.304
Who was that?

47:31.139 --> 47:32.850
Nuthin. It's nuthin.

47:33.016 --> 47:34.141
Dad.

47:34.142 --> 47:36.310
I heard you.

47:36.311 --> 47:37.979
They still don't have a clue.

47:37.980 --> 47:41.315
They're trying to say that Will had been
caught up in some sketchy people or something.

47:41.316 --> 47:41.733
That's bullshit.

47:41.734 --> 47:42.817
I know, honey.

47:42.818 --> 47:44.652
Well, did you tell him that?
What did you say?

47:44.653 --> 47:46.195
What do you think I said?

47:46.196 --> 47:48.406
Why don't you go check out
them two savages?

47:48.407 --> 47:50.491
Why would he talk to them?

47:50.492 --> 47:54.328
I bet you they still got that
gun in the trunk of the car.

47:54.329 --> 47:55.705
They won't listen.

47:55.706 --> 47:57.415
Still doing the investigation,
or whatever.

47:57.416 --> 48:00.668
Won't tell me anything anyway,
even if they do talk to him.

48:00.669 --> 48:03.337
Why would they have
a gun in their car?

48:03.338 --> 48:04.172
They got one.

48:04.173 --> 48:05.423
A rifle.

48:05.424 --> 48:07.174
How do you know that?

48:07.175 --> 48:09.176
That morning I went
over to talk to 'em.

48:09.177 --> 48:11.012
We got in a big of a scrap.

48:11.013 --> 48:13.557
It broke up but I noticed
one of 'em had a gun.

48:13.640 --> 48:16.517
Just this old hunting rifle. And
they were pointing it at me.

48:16.518 --> 48:17.727
What? Why didn't you tell me?

48:17.728 --> 48:19.729
Why didn't you say anything
when you got home?

48:19.730 --> 48:21.439
I obviously didn't
think anything of it.

48:21.440 --> 48:24.233
I was gonna tell Burt so
he'd keep an eye on it.

48:24.234 --> 48:27.028
Well, it's a little too fuckin'
late for that now, isn't it?

48:27.029 --> 48:29.030
We don't even know if
it was him, Emma.

48:29.031 --> 48:30.031
It's just suspicious,
that's all.

48:30.032 --> 48:31.532
I can't believe you!

48:31.533 --> 48:34.702
Somebody points a gun at you and then
that night you're getting shot at?

48:34.703 --> 48:37.705
That's a little bit more
than suspicious, Dad.

48:37.706 --> 48:39.749
It doesn't take very much
to connect those dots.

48:39.750 --> 48:40.417
Yes, but -

48:40.418 --> 48:42.084
Why didn't you tell anybody?

48:42.085 --> 48:43.377
Will might not be dead now.

48:43.378 --> 48:44.545
I know honey, but -

48:44.546 --> 48:46.380
Do you know how
fucked up this is?

48:46.381 --> 48:47.049
I do!

48:47.050 --> 48:48.382
I'm gonna go back to town.

48:48.383 --> 48:49.927
Just listen!

48:50.260 --> 48:51.929
Fuck sakes!

48:53.472 --> 48:54.472
Arrgh!

49:08.403 --> 49:10.279
What?

49:10.280 --> 49:12.406
It seems like all
this stuff started happening

49:12.407 --> 49:13.283
before I was even born.

49:13.284 --> 49:15.577
And here I am getting
the worst of it.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.078
It's not fair!

49:17.079 --> 49:19.247
Everybody around here
knows about you.

49:19.289 --> 49:20.414
And about the Winsors.

49:20.415 --> 49:22.667
And about how you're all a bunch
of fuckin' mental cases-

49:22.668 --> 49:25.419
trying to beat the shit out of
each other for twenty years.

49:25.420 --> 49:26.921
Listen -

49:26.922 --> 49:29.423
I don't want to hear any more about
it, Dad. I'm sick to death of it!

49:29.424 --> 49:30.591
You're sick of it?

49:30.592 --> 49:33.261
Those people have been fucking
with me my whole life.

49:33.303 --> 49:34.179
And over what?

49:34.180 --> 49:35.346
Being a Catholic?

49:35.347 --> 49:38.182
Or being from the wrong
side of the goddamned bay?

49:38.183 --> 49:41.269
I'm sorry I don't have the
stomach to be talked down to-

49:41.311 --> 49:43.437
by a bunch of entitled
little pricks.

49:43.438 --> 49:46.274
My fadder didn't. My brothers
didn't. And I certainly won't.

49:46.316 --> 49:48.109
Yeah, but Dad.
It's hurting me now.

49:48.110 --> 49:49.777
Can't you just try to
swallow that?

49:49.778 --> 49:50.945
Will's dead!

49:50.946 --> 49:53.656
I know he's fuckin' dead. It
coulda been me, remember?

49:53.657 --> 49:55.116
Yeah, well maybe
it shoulda been.

49:55.117 --> 49:57.285
At least all this stuff
will be over then.

49:57.327 --> 49:58.327
Honey!

49:59.204 --> 50:00.288
Honey!

50:00.330 --> 50:01.456
Christ!

51:46.228 --> 51:47.561
Hey Paddy.

51:47.562 --> 51:48.646
What are y'at, Jer?

51:48.647 --> 51:53.317
This and that. Little dessert
after supper, you know.

51:53.318 --> 51:54.736
Yeah, same here.

51:56.780 --> 51:59.573
Listen, I heard about
Paula's son 'n that.

51:59.574 --> 52:00.741
That's unreal, man.

52:00.742 --> 52:02.243
I couldn't believe it myself.

52:02.244 --> 52:05.831
Yeah, thanks. Rough week.

52:06.748 --> 52:08.083
You can say that again.

52:11.920 --> 52:13.338
So how are ya?

52:14.589 --> 52:16.174
Good b'y, you know.

52:17.259 --> 52:19.593
Few of the b'ys are saying that-

52:19.594 --> 52:22.931
you had the wake down in the Cove
at the Catholic Church 'n that.

52:23.014 --> 52:24.014
Yeah.

52:25.600 --> 52:27.602
That's a bit inappropriate,
that's all.

52:29.813 --> 52:31.438
What do you mean?

52:31.439 --> 52:33.607
Well, you know. With everything
that gone on before.

52:33.608 --> 52:38.696
You know, people feeling a little
tense about it. That's all.

52:38.697 --> 52:40.948
I grew up with his father.
Did you know that?

52:40.949 --> 52:42.701
He was the best kinda man.

52:44.369 --> 52:45.828
Carried his casket
and everything.

52:45.829 --> 52:48.706
Long before you got tangled
up with Will 'n that.

52:48.707 --> 52:50.791
You know, maybe
he woulda liked it-

52:50.792 --> 52:54.628
if his son went through the same
church as he did. That's all.

52:54.629 --> 52:56.964
Me 'n Will tangled up.

52:56.965 --> 52:58.048
You knows what I mean.

52:58.049 --> 53:00.968
No b'y I don't. So for fuck
sakes, spit it out.

53:00.969 --> 53:03.470
It's a fuckin' whole lotta
good it did him!

53:03.471 --> 53:04.889
That's all.
That's what I means!

53:04.890 --> 53:07.975
What? Are you trying to tell me
it's my fuckin' fault, or somethin?

53:07.976 --> 53:09.977
No, Jesus.

53:09.978 --> 53:12.646
He just never shoulda been
there in the first place.

53:12.647 --> 53:15.858
And it's 'cause of all the shit
that you got yourself caught up in-

53:15.859 --> 53:17.151
that he got killed.

53:17.152 --> 53:20.321
Nobody got a fuckin' clue what
went on, or who done it. Nudding.

53:20.322 --> 53:23.658
But I bet you got a few
ideas, don't ya?

53:25.911 --> 53:28.370
I was down to the
wife's family that night.

53:28.371 --> 53:30.497
So I'm only going by
what I been told.

53:30.498 --> 53:31.498
And?

53:33.001 --> 53:35.503
And I hear tell that you
got a big mouth.

53:36.922 --> 53:38.672
[Laughs}

53:38.673 --> 53:43.510
And I hear tell that you
and the Doyle boy

53:43.511 --> 53:47.014
ran into a few of the b'ys from down
my way a few nights before that.

53:47.015 --> 53:50.517
Yeah. I did go over and see that
little Mike Winsor shit -

53:50.518 --> 53:53.687
On account of Emma saying he was
giving her a hard time, that's all.

53:53.688 --> 53:55.357
Lost me temper, I s'pose.

53:55.857 --> 53:57.275
Right.

53:58.902 --> 53:59.902
Wha?

54:00.403 --> 54:01.446
Nudding b'y.

54:02.364 --> 54:04.406
Just steer clear of it,
that's all.

54:04.407 --> 54:05.699
'Cause I knows what you're like.

54:05.700 --> 54:06.867
You'll be fuckin' poking around.

54:06.868 --> 54:08.911
You stay the hell out of it.

54:08.912 --> 54:09.537
Yeah?

54:09.538 --> 54:11.080
Yeah.

54:11.081 --> 54:13.040
That little angel Mike Winsor was poking
around my house after the funeral.

54:13.041 --> 54:16.543
Tell me that's not
instigating something.

54:16.544 --> 54:19.713
I dare say the poor fella was
just trying to pay his respects.

54:19.714 --> 54:23.050
And he didn't feel all that comfortable
doing it down at your house.

54:23.051 --> 54:24.802
And I would say, all things
considered,

54:24.803 --> 54:26.929
you can probably
understand that, right?

54:26.930 --> 54:31.558
Oooh. Sounds like you knows
exactly what's going on then.

54:31.559 --> 54:32.811
You watch yourself, now.

54:34.896 --> 54:37.941
'Cause I don't know if you
remembers, but I knew his father too.

54:38.024 --> 54:41.402
Not that well. But I never had
nudding ill to say about him.

54:41.403 --> 54:43.570
Carried his casket too, did you?

54:43.571 --> 54:48.576
No. But I knew him a lot longer,
and I was alright with you.

54:49.411 --> 54:51.453
So just stay clear of
'em, that's all.

54:51.454 --> 54:56.083
'Cause I don't wanna hear tell of you
giving him shit, or giving him grief.

54:56.084 --> 54:59.586
I never took you for one to be
drawing lines in the sand, Jer.

54:59.587 --> 55:02.340
Well, I guess you got to
sometimes, I s'pose.

55:03.842 --> 55:06.593
Well. I gotta get going.

55:06.594 --> 55:08.596
S'pose I'll be alright, will I?

55:08.638 --> 55:11.473
You're not gonna shoot me in the
back or nudding, are you?

55:11.474 --> 55:13.476
You or one of your buddies?

55:16.438 --> 55:17.856
You can go fuck yourself!

56:34.182 --> 56:35.849
Hey Winsor!

56:35.850 --> 56:38.060
The lies you been telling

56:38.061 --> 56:39.853
I hope you're
keeping them straight.

56:39.854 --> 56:41.188
'Cause you're gonna
be found out.

56:41.189 --> 56:43.607
You had a few, did ya?

56:43.608 --> 56:46.068
You mind yourself,
ya little shit.

56:46.069 --> 56:48.862
Drop over any time, old man.
I'll fuckin' flatten you.

56:48.863 --> 56:51.073
I hope you feels real goddamned
good about yourself, Michael!

56:51.074 --> 56:52.700
Ya fuckin' snake!

56:54.035 --> 56:55.078
What was that?

56:55.578 --> 56:56.870
You heard me.

56:56.871 --> 56:59.206
I sees you around my house
again, I'll fuckin' kill ya.

56:59.207 --> 57:00.207
Christ!

57:00.250 --> 57:01.418
Hey!

57:02.752 --> 57:04.087
Get inside! Go!

57:06.881 --> 57:07.882
Michael!

57:08.049 --> 57:09.716
Got me window fixed.

57:09.717 --> 57:11.428
She looks real good?

57:12.595 --> 57:14.555
Just go the fuck home out of it.

57:14.556 --> 57:15.890
Fuck off!

57:21.563 --> 57:23.897
Are you sure you can drive?

57:23.898 --> 57:25.900
Or should I give Burt a call?

57:52.260 --> 57:53.260
Hey!

57:53.595 --> 57:54.595
Come on!

57:54.679 --> 57:55.679
Wha?

57:55.763 --> 57:57.139
Bathroom! Come on.

57:57.140 --> 57:58.682
What, you fuckin' fag now?

57:58.683 --> 57:59.683
Get up!

58:06.649 --> 58:07.941
Fuck b'y!

58:07.942 --> 58:08.942
Shut up and listen!

58:08.943 --> 58:11.028
Are you serious? I got no
time for this bullshit.

58:11.029 --> 58:16.283
What did I just say?
Are you fuckin' retarded?

58:16.284 --> 58:18.285
Now you're gonna
straighten up, alright?

58:18.286 --> 58:20.162
Look, he came to me first.

58:20.163 --> 58:22.039
I don't fuckin' give a shit.

58:22.040 --> 58:25.292
The only answer that I
wants from you is yes.

58:25.293 --> 58:26.335
That's all.

58:26.336 --> 58:30.048
A fuckin' god damned yes.

58:30.715 --> 58:33.175
Now you're gonna straighten up.

58:33.176 --> 58:35.302
And you're gonna tell your
brother to follow suit.

58:35.303 --> 58:37.304
'Cause there's only so
much of my fuckin' neck-

58:37.305 --> 58:40.057
that I'm gonna put on the
line for the likes a ye.

58:40.058 --> 58:41.308
Paddy came to me first, man!

58:41.309 --> 58:43.810
He came to me! What
am I supposed to do?

58:43.811 --> 58:45.646
I don't give a fuck
what ya does.

58:45.647 --> 58:49.733
As long as you don't let it bleed
over into other people's lives.

58:49.734 --> 58:52.736
Keep your fuckin' bullshit to
yourself. Contained.

58:52.737 --> 58:54.821
Listen. Paddy is very lucky
right now. Because -

58:54.822 --> 58:59.159
I don't give a fuck
what ya done. Alright?

58:59.160 --> 59:02.371
It's a good fuckin' thing for
you that I knew your fadder.

59:02.372 --> 59:05.165
Now if you keeps walking around
acting like king shit -

59:05.166 --> 59:08.670
Well there's gonna be more than
fuckin' Paddy gunning for you.

59:10.171 --> 59:12.005
Fuck.

59:12.006 --> 59:14.716
I'm trying to fuckin'
take care of you.

59:14.717 --> 59:17.220
But you gotta fuckin' stop
drawing the heat into yourself.

59:18.179 --> 59:19.179
Alright.

59:22.267 --> 59:24.017
Now go finish your
fuckin' drink.

59:24.018 --> 59:26.854
I'm gonna have a fuckin' piss.

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:53.835
Where's the car?

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:55.502
I left it.

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:56.337
Where to?

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:57.421
A friend's.

01:01:57.422 --> 01:01:58.547
What did you do that for?

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:01.842
I can't find the keys. I s'pose
I left 'em up to John's.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.385
I was gonna use
that this evening.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:04.845
That's too bad, now isn't it?

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:06.012
Can you go get 'em?

01:02:06.013 --> 01:02:08.390
Jesus Christ b'y. Lay
the fuck off. You got legs.

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.350
Go get 'em yourself.

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:10.351
What's your problem, man?

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:11.352
You!

01:02:12.019 --> 01:02:13.187
Where's the gun?

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:15.355
Do you wanna tell the whole
neighbourhood?

01:02:15.356 --> 01:02:17.023
It's not in the car, is it?

01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:18.275
Never you mind where it's too.

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:19.068
I will mind.

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:20.360
Cops were here. Again.

01:02:20.361 --> 01:02:22.529
Burt was asking for you. This
whole thing is fucked, man.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:25.198
I was there too. You
gotta tell me what's going on.

01:02:25.199 --> 01:02:27.284
I'm sick of worrying.
And I'm sick of lying.

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:30.413
Don't make me tell you not to
say anything again.

01:02:31.038 --> 01:02:32.373
Now, what did you tell 'em?

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.209
Nudding.
I said you were out.

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:39.046
Right. Some fuckin'
useful for a change.

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:43.050
Like you been so
fuckin' useful all locked up.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:44.968
What's that?

01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:46.303
You done nudding for me.

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:48.930
Or Mom or this family for
years and you knows it.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.557
Is that so?

01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:53.226
All the time going on about family. Here
you are barely anything to do with one.

01:02:53.227 --> 01:02:54.978
You trying to say
we're not blood?

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:56.563
Let go a me.

01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:59.399
Let me tell you, if you're not blood,
I won't treat you like we're not blood.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.567
So where were you?

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:03.570
When I was alone with mudder
when she was coming apart?

01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:05.238
Don't fuckin' talk
to me about family.

01:03:05.239 --> 01:03:06.573
You're making a scene.

01:03:06.574 --> 01:03:09.994
You're always making a scene.
It's all you're ever fuckin' at.

01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:14.332
You were there too.
Don't forget it.

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:03.441
Hey! Winsor!

01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:20.540
Man, have you lost
your fuckin' mind?

01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:22.584
Where's that arsehole
brother of yours?

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.210
I got no time for this, man.

01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:28.256
You're lucky you're a little fuckin'
runt, or I'd beat the face right offa you.

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.717
Now, your brother was waving a
gun around that very morning.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:31.718
You remember.

01:05:34.221 --> 01:05:36.222
Chasing people down
in the street?

01:05:36.223 --> 01:05:37.724
People already thinks
you're mental.

01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:39.726
You're not doing yourself any
favours, you know.

01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:43.396
You knows if they get you, they're
not gonna try you like a child.

01:05:43.397 --> 01:05:45.732
They're gonna ship you
right off to the pen.

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:47.108
Up to Dorchester somewhere.

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:49.403
Maximum security
with the savages.

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:53.114
Are you done?

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:54.115
Yeah.

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:58.287
You don't have to pick
up for your brother.

01:05:58.537 --> 01:05:59.913
You don't know him.

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:02.624
Or the shit that he's getting on
with, or the likes of your father.

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.125
Man, you better watch yourself.

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:07.253
Poking around with Michael,
or whatever.

01:06:07.254 --> 01:06:10.091
You saw what happened to Doyle.

01:08:12.379 --> 01:08:13.631
Sober today, are ya?

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:19.261
You go no mouth today, or wha?

01:08:20.386 --> 01:08:21.888
I got nuthin' to say to you.

01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:23.890
I heard you had plenty
to say to Robbie.

01:08:23.974 --> 01:08:26.725
He told me you two had a
grand chat the other day.

01:08:26.727 --> 01:08:28.435
Just keep going b'y.

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:31.773
I figured you might wanna talk to me yourself
instead of playing Chinese whispering.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.233
Maybe something got
lost in translation.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:35.234
He can be a little
retarded all the same.

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:37.569
Jesus, I said just keep
going, will ya?

01:08:37.571 --> 01:08:40.908
If you wants to talk to me,
you talk to me. That's all.

01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:42.908
I can barely stand
the sight of you.

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:43.910
Yeah, you better.

01:08:45.578 --> 01:08:48.249
A wonder you can stand
the sight of yourself.

01:08:49.582 --> 01:08:53.920
I'll let you get going then.
You fuckin' geezer.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:59.425
So how long are you gonna be
able to lie about it all? >

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:00.801
Yeah?

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.679
You should get the
fuck away from me.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.180
I've done fuckin' around you.

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:07.600
The only thing I sees when I looks at
you is that stupid fadder of yours.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.477
And the bullshit that
he got on with.

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:11.312
No problem to tell you're
his fuckin' breed.

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:12.689
İs that so?

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:13.939
Yeah.

01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:15.774
You'd think having him locked
up your whole fuckin' life,

01:09:15.776 --> 01:09:17.986
you'd have better sense
to stay clear of it all.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.612
Do something with yourself.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.281
No reason for you
to be involved.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.283
It's no wonder he never
liked any of ye.

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:26.286
Your fadder never liked nudding.
He was a poisonous piece a shit.

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:28.955
Sat around cock eyed at
everybody, collecting welfare.

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.540
Pitiful.

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:33.292
Jesus, even if I lived next door to you,
I'd still hate you for what you done.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:34.794
I'd still want to see
you buried.

01:09:34.795 --> 01:09:36.796
- Well that's a fuckin' sin.
That is b'y.

01:09:36.796 --> 01:09:38.965
That's a waste of your life,
if you ask me.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:41.466
Waste of my life. And a
waste of your fadder's life.

01:09:41.468 --> 01:09:42.969
You mention my fadder
one more time-

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:46.471
I'm gonna put you in the ground right
next to Will, you understand me?

01:09:46.473 --> 01:09:48.308
Yeah, well you better not
fuckin' hesitate.

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:51.644
'Cause I'll cut your fuckin' miserable heart out
and shove it right down your fuckin' throat.

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:53.979
Will was like a son to me!
You know that!

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:57.650
I hope you get your fuckin' face beat
in, just like your fuckin' father.

01:09:57.651 --> 01:09:59.653
You hear me?
Piece a fuckin' garbage!

01:14:49.776 --> 01:14:51.820
You can't be fuckin' serious?

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.823
Arrgh!

01:18:40.173 --> 01:18:43.342
Fuck! Get the fuck out
before I fuckin' kill's ya.

01:18:43.343 --> 01:18:44.343
Robbie!

01:18:44.344 --> 01:18:45.845
Where's the fuckin' gun?

01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:46.846
Robbie!

01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:49.266
Ya fuckin'-

01:18:55.605 --> 01:18:56.897
Now here's the fuckin' gun?

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:58.023
Fuck you old man.

01:18:58.024 --> 01:18:59.358
I knows you fuckin' shot Will!

01:18:59.359 --> 01:19:00.901
Get off him!

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:03.947
Fuck! Get off!

01:19:08.535 --> 01:19:10.954
Ya fuckin' breed!

01:19:12.956 --> 01:19:15.374
You want your
fuckin' knife back?

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:17.376
You want your fuckin'
knife back?

01:19:17.377 --> 01:19:18.378
Robbie!

01:19:19.212 --> 01:19:21.465
Paddy! Stop it!

01:19:22.048 --> 01:19:23.884
You're not gonna shoot me.

01:19:24.217 --> 01:19:26.469
Now you tell me what fuckin'
happened to Will.

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.221
Or I'll fuckin' gut
this little fucker.

01:19:28.889 --> 01:19:30.890
Fuck, it was an accident, b'y.

01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:32.558
He was just trying to scare ya!

01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:37.062
He's nudding but snake in the grass,
Robbie, running right the fuck around you.

01:19:37.063 --> 01:19:37.898
He's not.

01:19:38.064 --> 01:19:39.064
Hey, Robbie!

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:09.215
Yeah.

01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:13.053
How are you, Sweetie?

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:18.725
I know.
Everything's sorted now.

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:23.395
Don't know yet. I'm
at the station now.

01:22:23.396 --> 01:22:25.482
I just spoke with him.

01:22:26.066 --> 01:22:26.942
Yeah.

01:22:26.943 --> 01:22:29.402
Yeah, I'll call you as
soon as I know.

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:34.239
I'll see you when you get
out then. Friday.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:37.326
And everything is sorted for Sunday,
so don't you worry about a thing.

01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:39.496
You just take care of yourself.

01:22:40.163 --> 01:22:41.164
Yeah.

01:22:42.582 --> 01:22:47.087
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, you be good.

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:50.090
You too Sweetie.

01:22:56.429 --> 01:22:57.429
Burt.

01:22:57.931 --> 01:22:58.931
Want a lift home?

01:22:59.766 --> 01:23:01.433
Naw, that's okay.
I'm just going down to Paddy's.

01:23:01.434 --> 01:23:02.519
I was gonna walk.

01:23:03.186 --> 01:23:04.436
Jesus no, woman.

01:23:04.437 --> 01:23:06.772
I won't sleep tonight, knowing I
left you out in the cold.

01:23:06.773 --> 01:23:07.983
Hop in.

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:40.639
Not allowed to smoke in
the house anymore.

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.687
No, the woman had 'er painted.

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:50.149
And put her foot
down, as they say.

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:51.483
I says to 'er, listen-

01:23:51.484 --> 01:23:53.569
If I can't smoke in my
own friggin' home,

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:56.488
well, I'm, you know, smoking
in the car and that's it.

01:23:56.489 --> 01:23:59.492
Me own little sanctuary,
and nudding else to it.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.495
And what did she say
about all that?

01:24:03.496 --> 01:24:07.499
Well, I s'pose I'm gonna have to build
a goddamned shed to have a draw in, now!

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.542
[Paula laughs}

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:10.335
'Cause she doesn't want the
car stinking of smoke.

01:24:10.336 --> 01:24:11.336
Smart woman.

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:14.507
Yeah, well, you knows.

01:24:16.843 --> 01:24:20.888
Anyway, my dear, I just wanted
to tell you I'm sorry.

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:23.682
It's a sin what
happened to Will.

01:24:23.683 --> 01:24:25.727
Thanks, I appreciate that.

01:24:27.687 --> 01:24:30.522
B'y, it's been such
a friggin mess.

01:24:30.523 --> 01:24:33.358
A real kick in the guts.

01:24:33.359 --> 01:24:36.862
We had to wait to piece the
whole thing together, you know.

01:24:36.863 --> 01:24:39.364
Jesus, Paddy was on me,
all like flies in shit.

01:24:39.365 --> 01:24:42.284
And I couldn't say anything
about any of it.

01:24:42.285 --> 01:24:44.787
Feels like it's my fault
or something.

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:46.122
Don't be so foolish.

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:49.375
It got nudding to do with you.
We'll all keep going.

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:52.545
Yeah, s'pose we will.

01:24:54.547 --> 01:24:55.757
And the Winsor boy?

01:24:57.217 --> 01:24:58.550
- Not a clue.

01:24:58.551 --> 01:24:59.761
City crew got that now.

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:02.555
Not enough manpower out here.

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:05.557
But they got him.

01:25:05.558 --> 01:25:08.393
They got the gun and all that.

01:25:08.394 --> 01:25:12.107
I don't know how it'll all play
out, but Mick will be gone for good.

01:25:13.733 --> 01:25:18.279
It's not that much of a surprise,
now, with the likes of them.

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:21.240
They's nudding but trash,
the lot of them.

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:22.908
Well, the young fella had
his hand forced.

01:25:22.909 --> 01:25:26.578
I can't let myself believe
they'd such spiteful things.

01:25:26.579 --> 01:25:30.666
Well, Jesus, forced or no,
he pulled that trigger.

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:34.420
Now he made his bed, he's gonna
lay in it a long while, I'd say.

01:25:35.588 --> 01:25:36.589
And over what?

01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:39.259
Settling a score nobody
else was keeping?

01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:42.762
All seems so pointless.

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:45.807
I don't know what to make of it.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.282
You gonna need a ride later?

01:26:02.615 --> 01:26:04.867
I'm gonna keep cleaning.
Go through a few things.

01:26:04.868 --> 01:26:07.787
Try to get as much done
as I can before the funeral.

01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:10.330
I'll be here a few
hours at least.

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:11.331
I don't mind.

01:26:15.962 --> 01:26:17.714
How's Emma keeping?

01:26:20.633 --> 01:26:21.634
I don't know.

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:26.222
She's a tough girl. She'll have
time to bounce back from it all.

01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:29.517
But I dunno. It's a lot
to take in, I s'pose.

01:26:31.811 --> 01:26:34.480
She'll be home Friday if you
wants to come see her.

01:26:34.898 --> 01:26:35.898
Yeah, I will.

01:26:42.405 --> 01:26:43.739
Thanks for the ride.

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:45.325
Hey.

01:26:46.659 --> 01:26:48.536
You gonna be alright?

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:52.498
I really don't know.
