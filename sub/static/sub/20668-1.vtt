01:37.348 --> 01:38.562
Hey, boss.

01:38.569 --> 01:40.629
Yo, you all right?

01:41.327 --> 01:42.338
20 Golds.

01:42.446 --> 01:44.524
All right, this is it.

02:05.933 --> 02:08.634
<i>People got a lot of names
for someone like me</i>

02:09.929 --> 02:11.631
<i>The way I see it,</i>

02:11.910 --> 02:15.550
<i>I deal in the lies people tell
and the truths they don't.</i>

02:18.612 --> 02:20.411
<i>I deal in secrets.</i>

02:30.319 --> 02:33.320
<i>I dig them up or I bury them</i>

02:33.820 --> 02:35.320
<i>forever.</i>

02:36.816 --> 02:39.398
<i>I've been doing that
for at least half my life.</i>

03:23.370 --> 03:24.401
You see that?

03:24.891 --> 03:26.399
Quick on your feet.

03:27.179 --> 03:30.029
That's the first
principle of greatness.

03:30.227 --> 03:33.084
Quick feet had nothing, unless
you keep your head still.

03:33.285 --> 03:37.379
And you've got to know the
exact location of your off stump.

03:37.582 --> 03:38.888
Right?

03:39.088 --> 03:41.379
- Oi, Are you listening?
- Dad.

03:41.519 --> 03:44.482
It's what I call
your moral compass.

03:44.682 --> 03:48.457
Once you know its whereabouts,
you can do whatever you please.

03:48.646 --> 03:49.754
Yeah, okay.

03:49.990 --> 03:54.365
Us immigrants, we've got to be
better than the locals.

03:54.456 --> 03:55.574
Who are you calling an immigrant?

03:55.680 --> 03:57.566
Shot!
What was that?

03:57.678 --> 03:59.397
King Viv!
Where?

03:59.990 --> 04:03.298
Let me see, ya bugga.

04:03.498 --> 04:04.578
<i>The old man reckons you can learn</i>

04:04.601 --> 04:07.289
<i>everything you need to about
life from the game of cricket.</i>

04:09.340 --> 04:12.429
<i>Not sure how much it helped him
when he fled Uganda in '73</i>

04:12.490 --> 04:15.389
<i>with nothing but a bag and his
army revolver under his jacket</i>

04:15.789 --> 04:17.197
<i>just in case.</i>

04:18.692 --> 04:21.357
<i>He was in the uh,
King's African Rifles.</i>

04:22.650 --> 04:24.360
<i>I think he still got
the gun somewhere.</i>

04:27.980 --> 04:28.970
Did you see that range?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.091
<i>A super shot, beautifully positioned.</i>

04:31.891 --> 04:33.897
- What a monster.
- Merciless, man.

04:34.589 --> 04:36.091
Dad.
Yes!

04:36.191 --> 04:37.022
Pills.

04:38.151 --> 04:41.324
<i>Off the back foot this time.
That languid flow of the bat.</i>

04:42.310 --> 04:44.240
<i>Glorious stuff.</i>

04:45.239 --> 04:46.351
All right?

04:49.028 --> 04:50.449
Where are you going?

04:51.381 --> 04:53.157
I'm going to work.
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:58,257
<i>The last ball of the 50th over and
he's finished it off nicely with a six.</i>

05:07.602 --> 05:11.206
<i>We've all got our stories,
our lies, our secrets.</i>

05:14.002 --> 05:15.525
<i>They say the truth
will always out.</i>

05:15.802 --> 05:17.530
<i>Well, I hope not.</i>

05:17.652 --> 05:19.298
<i>I'd be out of a job,
for a start.</i>

05:20.112 --> 05:21.256
There you go.

05:26.804 --> 05:28.300
<i>People call me a snoop.</i>

05:30.615 --> 05:32.110
<i>And they call me a lot worse.</i>

05:45.648 --> 05:47.020
Your door was open.

05:48.448 --> 05:51.270
No worries.
Come in, Miss uh...

05:51.401 --> 05:52.288
Chase.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.450
Melody Chase.

06:02.002 --> 06:03.550
How'd you find me, Miss Chase?

06:03.600 --> 06:05.693
I've got an app, Mr. Akhtar.

06:26.002 --> 06:30.353
Natasha, my flatmate.
She's gone missing.

06:32.003 --> 06:33.749
- She Russian?
- What?

06:34.103 --> 06:35.350
Hookers.

06:35.503 --> 06:38.362
Orientals are adjectives.
Happy, Lucky, Smiley, whatever.

06:38.550 --> 06:42.021
Black girls are musical nouns.
Harmony, Jazz, Melody.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.419
And um...

06:45.940 --> 06:48.019
Russians just sound Russian.

06:49.040 --> 06:52.019
- Ford cars, from back in the day.
- What d'you mean?

06:52.540 --> 06:55.019
Black girls. I know
a Seirra, a Capri, a Fiesta.

06:55.531 --> 06:57.950
- You're funny.
- You have no idea.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.350
Natasha, she met
a client yesterday.

07:03.426 --> 07:04.688
Never came home.

07:05.028 --> 07:06.509
I'm worried.

07:08.001 --> 07:10.550
He was a new client,
so we met him together.

07:10.681 --> 07:13.150
Two pairs of eyes.
That's the rule.

07:13.231 --> 07:14.450
- At the Tunnel, Mayfair.
- Mm

07:14.701 --> 07:17.350
I had a drink with him.
I left about midnight.

07:17.501 --> 07:18.350
So, what's he look like?

07:18.981 --> 07:23.350
Middle-aged, suit,
another Paki.

07:25.001 --> 07:26.280
I've got photos.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.280
Nice.

07:35.801 --> 07:38.400
- What's this?
- Hotels we use.

07:40.891 --> 07:45.300
My rate's 300 a day plus expenses.
That's the best I can do.

07:45.791 --> 07:48.300
What?
What would you charge?

07:48.701 --> 07:50.390
I charge 300 an hour.

07:51.801 --> 07:53.600
I'm in the wrong game.

07:54.431 --> 07:56.500
She's been gone what, 8 hours?

07:57.301 --> 07:59.300
Don't you think
you're being a bit paro?

08:01.021 --> 08:02.200
Well, I do.

08:02.921 --> 08:05.400
A lot can happen in 8 hours.

08:10.021 --> 08:12.300
Well, Miss Chase, I'll uh...

08:12.821 --> 08:14.200
be in touch.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.270
Mr. Akhtar.

08:51.001 --> 08:53.270
Oh crit, check out boy, man.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.270
- You all right, Mrs. E?
- Hey!

08:57.501 --> 08:59.270
Um, he's in trouble again.

08:59.601 --> 09:01.370
Would you mind
talking to him, Tommy?

09:01.901 --> 09:04.370
- Me?
- Avid will listen to you.

09:04.901 --> 09:06.370
We need to singe this, bruv.

09:06.901 --> 09:08.370
Yo fam, you got a fag?

09:08.901 --> 09:10.169
You shouldn't smoke.

09:10.201 --> 09:12.369
Smoke? I don't smoke.
I blaze.

09:12.501 --> 09:14.369
Fools like this
need padding, bloke.

09:15.001 --> 09:17.369
Dickheads, man.
Reasonin'.

09:21.001 --> 09:22.369
Where's my money?

09:23.001 --> 09:24.369
And the rest?

09:25.501 --> 09:27.170
- Going to Mayfair.
- Mayfair?

09:27.601 --> 09:29.370
Yeah, I know. I'm
moving up in the world.

09:49.101 --> 09:52.270
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
Supposed to be checked in here last night.

09:54.101 --> 09:55.092
Let's go.

09:58.801 --> 10:00.484
- I'm wondering if you can help me.
- Sure.

10:01.504 --> 10:03.884
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

10:09.203 --> 10:11.543
Hi, I was hoping you
might be able to help me.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.044
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

10:13.503 --> 10:16.274
- Supposed to be checked in here last night.
- Yeah, I'd seen her.

10:16.386 --> 10:17.218
- Yeah?
- Mmhmm.

10:17.486 --> 10:21.118
- Any idea what floor or room?
- Um, room 512.

10:21.386 --> 10:24.152
- You sure? Thank you.
- Mmhmm.

10:24.341 --> 10:26.248
- That's for you. Take care.
- Thanks.

10:30.144 --> 10:33.188
Yeah, Big John, bingo.
Don't wait for me.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.291
Fuck.

12:09.310 --> 12:10.685
Housekeeping.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.285
Hello?

12:54.510 --> 12:56.293
- Double Turk, no ice.
- Sure.

12:57.340 --> 12:58.344
Here you go.

13:17.038 --> 13:18.452
<i>Hello, which emergency service
do you require?</i>

13:18.501 --> 13:20.267
Hello, police, please?

13:20.401 --> 13:21.840
<i>Police emergency,
how can I help you?</i>

13:21.980 --> 13:24.240
Yes, I would like to
report a murder, please.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.617
Tommy fuckin' Akhtar.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.533
Oh fuck.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.133
- Shelley.
- Tommy.

13:53.322 --> 13:54.933
- You're back.
- Yeah.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.233
- How long?
- Couple of months.

13:59.900 --> 14:03.233
- You never...
- No... I meant to. I was just...

14:03.544 --> 14:05.333
I really meant to.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.382
You come here every year?

14:13.989 --> 14:15.234
Thank you.

14:34.536 --> 14:35.825
Em...

14:37.136 --> 14:39.310
Oh, come.
Come now.

14:42.705 --> 14:45.310
Em, this is Tommy Akhtar,
we were...

14:45.705 --> 14:48.220
We were friends
a long time ago.

14:48.286 --> 14:49.380
You knew my dad?

14:52.176 --> 14:53.195
Yeah.

14:58.801 --> 15:00.242
Fancy flowers.

15:01.824 --> 15:03.242
From Lovely, innit?

15:04.857 --> 15:06.239
Always showing off.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.389
I've got this new job.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.392
You should come by.

15:20.390 --> 15:21.392
Come on.

16:23.220 --> 16:24.540
I'm Shelley.

16:24.710 --> 16:27.240
Yeah, you're Stuart's girlfriend.

16:29.710 --> 16:32.310
Yeah, Stuart's girlfriend.

16:37.820 --> 16:39.210
You're in my English class.

16:41.010 --> 16:43.213
Yeah, of course.

16:45.910 --> 16:53.224
I recognize no words like,
what was that "episodic allegory"?

16:53.389 --> 16:54.503
Remember that?

16:56.710 --> 16:59.862
I dunno. I guess it's my dad.

17:01.165 --> 17:02.241
You talking to my girl?

17:02.382 --> 17:04.241
No, I was just... joking.

17:05.982 --> 17:08.241
So, um, you Churchill Massive
or what?

17:08.982 --> 17:11.241
- Yeah, of course.
- C'mon, then.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.241
What are you playin' at?

17:47.982 --> 17:49.241
That's not very friendly.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.241
All right, sit down.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.241
Tame shit, bruv.

17:56.482 --> 17:59.241
If you wanna knock one out,
you need to go online some.

17:59.492 --> 18:02.041
- It's work.
- Course it is.

18:02.552 --> 18:05.241
- Lets give it up.
- Yeah man, take a toke.

18:06.452 --> 18:08.241
Hey, what the fuck, Tommy, man!

18:08.452 --> 18:10.241
My office, my rules.
Fags only.

18:11.652 --> 18:15.241
You kissing the teeth? I got
bog roll more abrasive than you man.

18:15.584 --> 18:17.241
- What'd you want?
- I don't want nuttin.

18:17.484 --> 18:19.241
Mum told me to
come round here.

18:19.484 --> 18:21.241
Said you wanted to
talk to me or suttin.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.398
Did she now?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.391
Yeah. I mean I think so.

18:24.528 --> 18:27.362
She's all like, Avid, do this,
Avid do that.

18:27.402 --> 18:29.363
Or don't do this,
or don't do that.

18:29.502 --> 18:31.361
Fuck it. Why the fuck
you laughing though?

18:31.502 --> 18:33.361
That's extra, you get me?

18:33.502 --> 18:35.361
That phone is lame.

18:36.502 --> 18:38.361
This is evidence.

18:39.361 --> 18:41.361
But, don't know the PIN.

18:42.502 --> 18:44.361
Give it here, man.

18:45.902 --> 18:47.361
Piece of piss.

18:48.202 --> 18:51.169
The default- 1, 2, 3, 4.

18:51.302 --> 18:53.362
Come on, bruv,
everybody knows that.

18:53.602 --> 18:55.362
- All right, send it.
- Hold on.

18:55.702 --> 18:56.762
There's an SD card.

18:58.302 --> 19:01.362
Oh, it's locked.
Got a decrypt?

19:01.572 --> 19:03.362
- What?
- Decrypt.

19:03.662 --> 19:05.362
Don't know what
a decrypt is?

19:05.662 --> 19:09.362
Keep up bruv. I'll take
it, yeah? Rip it easy.

19:10.262 --> 19:11.362
All right.

19:12.062 --> 19:13.662
You should let me
work with you, man.

19:14.662 --> 19:17.562
Tommy and Av.
T.A. Confidential.

19:17.862 --> 19:19.162
You get me?

19:19.284 --> 19:20.562
Your mum would love that,
wouldn't she?

19:20.662 --> 19:22.062
Yeah, she's all over you.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.762
Just go easy on your mum, yeah?

19:23.962 --> 19:26.362
All right?
Yeah, man.

19:26.662 --> 19:28.362
All right, go on, piss off.

19:28.662 --> 19:29.762
All right, later.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.364
All right then, jump up there.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.364
All right, I call it a tight rope.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.164
Initiation.
We all done it, innit, twat?

19:51.334 --> 19:52.274
Of course.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.364
Yeah, today.
C'mon, Tommy, let's go.

19:57.170 --> 19:58.702
You look forward to
joining our gang, yeah?

20:00.270 --> 20:02.184
- Who's that?
- Go on, Tommy!

20:02.370 --> 20:04.284
- Atta boy!
- Are you mad?

20:04.470 --> 20:05.614
I ain't scared.

20:06.290 --> 20:07.464
Get down!

20:07.590 --> 20:09.364
Keep going.
You're almost there.

20:09.580 --> 20:11.364
Go on son, keep going.

20:11.580 --> 20:13.364
Go on Tom.
Go on son.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.364
Go on Tommy, keep going.

20:16.580 --> 20:18.364
Tommy, just get down!

20:20.280 --> 20:21.464
No!

20:58.340 --> 21:00.864
<i>This is Hafiz Ansari.
Please leave a message.</i>

22:21.240 --> 22:24.364
<i>Thanks, Mr. Ansari,
you've been very helpful.</i>

22:24.540 --> 22:25.584
We'll be in touch.

22:26.340 --> 22:28.384
- Is everything okay?
- It's fine.

23:06.240 --> 23:09.485
You all right? Is Lovely there?
I mean... Hafiz.

23:22.140 --> 23:23.483
Fuckin' Lovely.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.486
You all right, Lovely?

23:43.640 --> 23:45.487
No one's called me that in time.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.482
I bet.

23:47.736 --> 23:49.482
Some cheeky cigarette, man.

23:50.738 --> 23:53.481
Wait, is that your dad's office?
I hardly recognized it.

23:55.139 --> 23:56.480
You got a fuckin' pond.

23:57.139 --> 23:59.483
No, it's a water feature.

24:02.039 --> 24:03.569
Trust me man, women.

24:03.649 --> 24:05.179
I wouldn't know.

24:05.329 --> 24:06.399
I know you wouldn't, man.

24:07.349 --> 24:09.389
Tommy fuckin' Akhtar, man.
Come here.

24:10.249 --> 24:14.390
- Shit, man, how you been?
- Good. You?

24:14.449 --> 24:15.299
Yeah, all right.

24:15.382 --> 24:17.386
I heard you became a detective.

24:17.482 --> 24:19.485
Finding lost car keys
and missing dogs.

24:19.882 --> 24:21.587
And the rest.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.385
Come, man let's
get a drink. Jesus.

24:25.188 --> 24:26.388
Hey, how's the old man?

24:27.278 --> 24:30.477
Uh, prostate cancer. I moved
back to take care of him.

24:30.568 --> 24:33.379
- Fuck man, I'm sorry.
- It's fine. It's slow.

24:33.478 --> 24:35.381
Doctors say something else
will kill him first.

24:36.276 --> 24:38.284
If I stick around much
longer, it'd be me.

24:38.393 --> 24:39.287
Cheers.

24:39.396 --> 24:43.382
I always thought you'd uh, move out.
Pinner, Ruislip, one of them.

24:43.494 --> 24:47.376
Ah, no, no, no. This is our
manor, right? We got to pull it up.

24:48.194 --> 24:51.396
- Yeah, one water feature at a time.
- Yeah, exactly.

24:56.378 --> 24:59.385
About your business partner,
Usman Rana...

25:00.378 --> 25:01.405
He's dead.

25:02.189 --> 25:03.403
What's going on?

25:07.137 --> 25:10.282
I got a case looking
for a Russian hooker.

25:10.397 --> 25:11.388
She was with him.

25:13.317 --> 25:14.388
Fuck, Tommy.

25:15.528 --> 25:17.379
All right, it's a mess.

25:18.128 --> 25:20.377
It's a big fucking mess, man.

25:21.197 --> 25:24.382
Usman is my friend.
Well, he was.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.888
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

25:27.390 --> 25:29.388
Really, he was a good man.

25:29.787 --> 25:31.388
But you know, he was
a loose cannon.

25:31.787 --> 25:33.678
- He... fucking hookers.
- Yeah,

25:33.787 --> 25:35.378
I mean, fuck man.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.297
How does that look?

25:37.498 --> 25:39.378
And I'm trying to raise finance.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.378
And now, I mean, fuck.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.388
You know, I could
do with your help.

25:46.020 --> 25:47.369
Anything.

25:48.220 --> 25:50.382
I need to find out what happened
for business,

25:50.490 --> 25:52.990
but more importantly
for his family. All right?

25:53.250 --> 25:56.990
If you could just like, keep me in
the loop, man. I'd appreciate it.

25:57.050 --> 25:58.190
Of course.

25:59.150 --> 26:01.362
You know, it's just like
the old days, innit?

26:01.550 --> 26:02.682
Churchill Massive, right?

26:07.150 --> 26:08.382
I'm not sure if you're
allowed to do that

26:08.410 --> 26:10.382
once you got a water feature.

26:16.410 --> 26:18.382
- See you, man.
- See you.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.422
You know, listen,
You got a fag?

26:22.012 --> 26:24.222
Still fucking
bumming cigarettes.

26:24.412 --> 26:26.282
Some things never change, innit?

26:27.412 --> 26:29.382
Ah no, keep it.
It's all right.

26:29.912 --> 26:32.385
I pretend I don't smoke and
she pretends she don't know.

26:32.482 --> 26:35.085
Right. The key to a
successful marriage, yeah?

26:35.282 --> 26:38.323
It really is, don't joke.
Take care, man.

26:38.462 --> 26:39.383
Hey, um...

26:40.082 --> 26:43.323
I... I saw your flowers today.
They were nice.

26:45.282 --> 26:46.329
Yeah.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.389
You went to the grave, yeah?

26:50.494 --> 26:52.389
Yeah, it's the anniversary, so.

26:55.424 --> 26:57.384
It's another life innit, really.

26:58.424 --> 27:01.384
Hey, you need to let it go, yeah?

27:03.234 --> 27:04.284
Okay?

27:04.524 --> 27:08.384
- Um, be in touch
- Okay. Much love, man.

28:58.324 --> 29:00.002
All right, Lovely.
What are you doing here?

29:00.128 --> 29:02.588
I come for a ride, Tommy man.
I got to get the car back.

29:03.504 --> 29:05.388
Can we go inside?
It's freezing.

29:05.504 --> 29:06.387
Yeah, sorry.
Yeah, yeah, sure.

29:10.680 --> 29:13.484
"Quite dead. As dead
as a doornail."

29:14.110 --> 29:17.185
- Evening, Mr. Akhtar.
- Hello, Hafiz.

29:17.300 --> 29:18.485
Your friend tells
me you're studying

29:18.524 --> 29:22.385
"A Christmas Carol", Tommy boy.
You never told me.

29:22.954 --> 29:28.085
"I wear the chain
I forged in life."

29:28.402 --> 29:34.385
"I made it link by link,
yard by yard."

29:34.802 --> 29:36.385
Episodic allegory.

29:39.394 --> 29:41.385
Shell, come on.
We should go, yeah?

29:41.501 --> 29:43.385
I got to get the car back.

29:43.402 --> 29:46.385
I don't wanna go. I'm
talking to Mr. Akhtar.

29:50.771 --> 29:53.385
Tommy will walk me.
Won't you?

30:13.271 --> 30:14.385
What can I get you, sir?

30:14.401 --> 30:16.285
Hello mate, have you
got Wild Turkey?

30:16.292 --> 30:16.995
Yes, we do.

30:17.142 --> 30:19.372
- Can I get a double, please. No ice.
- Yeah, sure.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.372
Alex, can we check
these people to a table?

30:29.040 --> 30:31.372
Follow Alex, I'll be
right back. Thank you.

30:33.270 --> 30:34.382
Tommy.

30:35.070 --> 30:36.401
- You said I should come by.
- Yeah.

30:36.770 --> 30:38.401
So, I'm buying you a drink.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.201
I'm working. I'm not able...

30:43.170 --> 30:45.201
Right, yeah. Sorry.

30:45.870 --> 30:46.401
Um...

30:49.061 --> 30:50.301
Another time?

30:50.900 --> 30:51.685
Another time.

30:53.270 --> 30:54.385
Tomorrow?

30:56.310 --> 30:57.345
Yeah.

30:57.870 --> 31:01.392
I'm working till midnight.
Maybe we could have a nightcap.

31:02.010 --> 31:03.492
- Tomorrow's good.
- Okay.

31:06.410 --> 31:07.372
Okay.

31:13.190 --> 31:14.392
<i>You don't talk much.</i>

31:15.290 --> 31:16.372
<i>Sorry.</i>

31:16.700 --> 31:18.379
<i>No, it's nice.</i>

31:19.980 --> 31:22.185
I just want someone to listen.

31:23.390 --> 31:24.375
You know?

31:27.390 --> 31:28.375
Yeah.

31:32.740 --> 31:34.077
You better leave me here.

31:34.990 --> 31:37.384
Mum doesn't like seeing
me with strange boys.

31:38.370 --> 31:39.388
Am I a strange boy?

31:40.360 --> 31:41.389
A little bit.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.370
I don't give a fuck who you are,
it's my crime scene.

32:07.385 --> 32:08.683
We'll take it from here, officer.

32:08.698 --> 32:10.380
Yeah, well fuck you very much.

32:10.395 --> 32:11.480
We've got it. Thanks.

32:11.985 --> 32:13.770
- Hello?
- You all right, Cal?

32:13.880 --> 32:15.170
Tommy. Where are you?
33p
00:32:15,385 --> 00:32:16,390
Yeah, I'm across the canal.

32:19.245 --> 32:21.418
<i>2-6, CCTV needs a status.</i>

32:26.245 --> 32:29.327
The emergency call? God.

32:29.528 --> 32:32.325
"It ain't our fault, mum."
I should've known.

32:32.528 --> 32:34.326
"Will you please pursue, sir?"

32:34.528 --> 32:37.829
Funny.
What's going on, Tommy?

32:38.228 --> 32:40.330
By the time I got here,
the room was clean.

32:40.900 --> 32:42.530
Clean?

32:43.200 --> 32:44.530
Seal it banked.

32:44.900 --> 32:47.430
Even the security cams are gone.

32:47.537 --> 32:49.530
Spooks got on lockdown.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.430
- Wh, wh, what spooks?
- SO15.

32:52.700 --> 32:55.430
Counter fuckin' terrorism.
You shittin' me?

33:23.320 --> 33:24.440
You expecting trouble?

33:24.555 --> 33:26.460
Always, Mr. Akhtar.

33:26.475 --> 33:27.490
Call me Tommy.

33:28.955 --> 33:30.008
I'm gonna change.

33:34.125 --> 33:35.430
The living room's that way.

33:51.025 --> 33:52.248
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

33:52.299 --> 33:54.207
Those bullets get
stuck in my hair.

33:54.424 --> 33:55.386
I know the feeling.

33:57.384 --> 33:58.386
So...

33:58.484 --> 34:00.386
Did you um...

34:00.984 --> 34:03.036
find Natasha?

34:03.184 --> 34:04.086
No, not yet.

34:04.484 --> 34:06.376
I found a client though.

34:06.484 --> 34:08.485
- What'd he say?
- Not a lot.

34:11.284 --> 34:12.485
He's dead.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.284
Found him at the Holiday Inn.
Pretty messy.

34:15.485 --> 34:17.485
I believe the term is
"blunt instrument".

34:23.385 --> 34:25.485
You don't think that Natasha

34:27.385 --> 34:28.500
did it?

34:31.185 --> 34:32.487
Fuck.

34:34.105 --> 34:37.484
Usman Rana. That name
mean anything to you?

34:39.105 --> 34:40.483
You sure about that?

34:41.505 --> 34:45.489
No, he was just another client.

34:48.304 --> 34:51.282
All right. I'm gonna need to
have a look at her bedroom.

34:51.304 --> 34:52.476
Yeah.

35:12.315 --> 35:13.386
Why did she die?

35:13.825 --> 35:16.365
I dunno. You were her
friend. You tell me.

35:16.378 --> 35:17.568
I am her friend.

35:18.932 --> 35:21.465
When you do this job,
some things...

35:24.372 --> 35:26.352
Some things you don't...

35:26.475 --> 35:28.465
Yeah. I know what you mean.

35:42.364 --> 35:43.376
Pretty girl.

35:48.359 --> 35:49.369
Who's that?

35:50.342 --> 35:51.362
Her sister, I think.

35:58.129 --> 36:00.370
Wouldn't have had you down
as the sensitive type.

36:01.342 --> 36:02.362
Only when I shave.

36:03.302 --> 36:05.256
Can I hang on to this?

36:05.282 --> 36:06.369
Yeah.

36:08.502 --> 36:09.388
All right.

36:10.901 --> 36:12.491
I'll try to have
some more for you soon.

36:13.191 --> 36:14.591
Okay.

37:35.861 --> 37:36.984
Let's see that.

37:41.191 --> 37:44.475
- Do you think he fancies her?
- What?

37:45.011 --> 37:46.388
Well, you know what he's like.

37:48.111 --> 37:50.388
I dunno. Maybe.

37:52.124 --> 37:54.379
She's... I dunno, mate.

37:54.410 --> 37:55.689
It'll be fine.

37:55.922 --> 37:58.389
Don't know what I'll do, Tom.

37:59.142 --> 38:01.378
Stu, you've got nothing
to worry about, mate.

38:06.142 --> 38:07.378
Cheers, mate.

38:36.143 --> 38:37.382
Come on then,
what do you got?

38:37.600 --> 38:39.382
Spreadsheets innit, bruv.

38:40.100 --> 38:43.370
Yeah accounts.
Yeah, it's Rana's company.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.370
Why's he got them
on the phone, blud?

38:46.395 --> 38:50.369
I mean just one file.
That's weird, fam.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.390
Unless he's got
something to hide.

38:55.125 --> 38:56.385
Yeah, look at this.

38:57.124 --> 38:59.387
Yeah, 10K to the youth league.

38:59.403 --> 39:01.392
That's a lot of cheddar, fam.

39:02.399 --> 39:04.392
Swear, down this every month.

39:05.453 --> 39:08.192
How come they stopped like
two month ago though?

39:10.183 --> 39:12.252
What, you want a
reward or something?

39:12.361 --> 39:15.482
Nah, man. Just
T.A. Confidential's in it.

39:16.285 --> 39:18.269
Tommy and Av.
You get me?

39:18.485 --> 39:20.478
Yeah, never mind that.

39:21.270 --> 39:23.257
Who the fuck is the Islamic
Youth League?

39:59.270 --> 40:00.362
Thank you, brother.

40:03.572 --> 40:07.562
- As-salamu alaykum
- Wa alaykumu s-salam wa rahmatullah

40:07.894 --> 40:09.462
Have a seat, brother.

40:11.194 --> 40:13.471
I believe you wish to
discuss a donation.

40:14.094 --> 40:15.383
What did you have in mind?

40:15.594 --> 40:16.773
Um... Not a donation.

40:16.912 --> 40:19.383
I wanted to speak to you about
one of your donors, brother.

40:19.442 --> 40:21.392
Usman Rana.

40:22.132 --> 40:24.783
I believe he has made
significant contributions.

40:26.002 --> 40:28.340
Who are you, Mr. Akhtar?

40:28.952 --> 40:30.200
Sorry.

40:30.346 --> 40:31.809
I'm a private detective brother,

40:31.907 --> 40:36.105
I'm looking into his uh...
his murder.

40:39.607 --> 40:41.660
You know that, right?

40:43.307 --> 40:48.360
All I know is that this society
is riven with false idols.

40:49.007 --> 40:54.360
Sex, alcohol, drugs, money.
And every desire has its price.

40:56.007 --> 40:57.360
Is that a confession?

40:57.501 --> 40:59.360
It is the teaching of Allah.

41:00.901 --> 41:03.380
Rana was with a girl. A prostitute.
I'm looking for her.

41:08.001 --> 41:09.388
I can't help you.

41:11.240 --> 41:12.840
Can I just ask...

41:13.980 --> 41:16.400
Rana stopped making donations
a couple of months ago.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.412
Did you two fall out?

41:19.080 --> 41:21.412
Wasn't anything major, was it?

41:23.080 --> 41:25.412
Just 'cause if it was,
it doesn't look great.

41:25.488 --> 41:28.112
A high-profile Pakistani
businessman gets murdered.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.132
It's all hushed-up.
SO15 all over it.

41:30.181 --> 41:32.029
Geezer's connected to you.

41:32.088 --> 41:34.320
You argue with said geezer
and he winds up dead.

41:34.981 --> 41:36.320
You know, I'm just
playing dot-to-dot.

41:36.369 --> 41:38.320
Feel free to jump in
whenever you want.

41:38.340 --> 41:39.350
No need for panic buttons.

41:40.169 --> 41:41.350
There's no need for panic.

41:42.280 --> 41:44.016
I don't know what you're
up to and I don't care.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.354
I'm just looking for the girl.

41:45.501 --> 41:47.354
Like I said, I can't help you.

41:49.211 --> 41:53.343
There is a war going on.
And you don't even realize it.

41:53.651 --> 41:55.643
The war for our souls.

41:56.661 --> 41:58.443
I am prepared.

41:59.311 --> 42:00.543
Are you?

42:06.311 --> 42:07.338
Dyb dyb dyb

42:19.402 --> 42:20.347
<i>Brother!</i>

42:21.107 --> 42:22.448
As-salamu alaykum, brother.

42:22.659 --> 42:24.448
Long time, no see, huh?

42:24.659 --> 42:27.448
- I never met you before, mate.
- C'mon, man give me a hug.

42:28.112 --> 42:29.448
No offense, if you
lot gonna do this,

42:29.541 --> 42:31.008
you really gotta get some
brothers in the team.

42:31.019 --> 42:33.548
- I don't know what you're talking about, mate.
- All right? Equal opportunities, man.

42:33.641 --> 42:35.488
Ask for some CV's

42:35.541 --> 42:37.448
Yo, is that a detective?

42:41.541 --> 42:43.448
<i>Yeah, the cover's been blown.</i>

42:59.341 --> 43:01.348
Double Turk. No ice.

43:11.341 --> 43:13.348
I wasn't sure you'd come.

43:14.341 --> 43:16.337
You're paying me.
Of course, I'll come.

43:16.352 --> 43:18.348
People pay me.
I don't come.

43:24.022 --> 43:25.336
You're drunk.

43:25.341 --> 43:29.339
Yes, but tomorrow,
I will be beautiful.

43:29.857 --> 43:31.336
What about tonight?

43:34.044 --> 43:35.342
A date.

43:36.344 --> 43:37.612
Oh.

43:38.044 --> 43:42.342
Some call it the uh,
"The Girlfriend Experience", yeah?

43:44.144 --> 43:46.342
So they say.

43:49.044 --> 43:51.342
Yeah, well, what do they know.

43:58.004 --> 44:01.342
What about you?
Nobody special?

44:08.044 --> 44:12.338
When someone goes missing,
they say the first 24 hours...

44:13.323 --> 44:15.022
On TV, I mean.

44:15.210 --> 44:18.038
Firstly, that's missing kids.
Second and worse, TV.

44:18.062 --> 44:19.344
I'm on it.

44:19.458 --> 44:21.344
Okay, let's say
Natasha didn't do it.

44:21.547 --> 44:25.344
Okay? Somebody could've
followed them that night, so.

44:25.547 --> 44:27.344
Who else was there,
at the Tunnel?

44:27.647 --> 44:30.354
- I told you.
- I know what you told me.

44:30.747 --> 44:33.254
I'm talking about
doormen, bar staff, whatever...

44:37.347 --> 44:38.258
Tunde.

44:40.017 --> 44:41.328
Okay, who's Tunde?

44:41.481 --> 44:44.332
He's a dealer.
He's there most nights.

44:45.128 --> 44:47.354
He's just, you know, some...

44:48.128 --> 44:49.388
Some what?

44:50.028 --> 44:51.388
Choc ice.

44:53.828 --> 44:55.388
Okay. Anyone else?

44:55.728 --> 44:56.388
No.

44:56.728 --> 44:58.388
No one I could talk to?

44:59.728 --> 45:00.388
No.

45:04.328 --> 45:05.388
I have to go.

45:26.128 --> 45:27.399
Double Turk, no ice.

45:28.328 --> 45:29.388
Drinking bourbon?

45:31.328 --> 45:32.388
That's my drink.

45:33.128 --> 45:35.388
Everyone tells me you
guys drink warm beer.

45:35.828 --> 45:38.388
Seems to me it's European
lager and American whiskey

45:38.408 --> 45:39.888
all the way with you Londoners.

45:40.068 --> 45:41.400
I'm just sayin'.

45:42.268 --> 45:44.388
Expectations.

45:45.068 --> 45:46.388
I mean, take you.

45:49.026 --> 45:50.488
You were at the hotel.

45:52.010 --> 45:54.376
And then you called the cops
on that phone, right there.

45:55.180 --> 45:57.376
A small-time private eye.

45:59.180 --> 46:01.376
Not what I was expecting.

46:02.180 --> 46:04.376
You take anything
from that hotel room?

46:08.080 --> 46:11.376
You know the uh, the
worst thing about Londoners?

46:13.080 --> 46:17.388
They're not very friendly,
not to strangers.

46:20.080 --> 46:23.188
You need to stay out of this,
Mr. Akhtar.

46:25.080 --> 46:29.376
I'm just a...
what's the expression?

46:31.080 --> 46:33.346
Dipping the wick.

46:34.080 --> 46:35.400
I love that.

46:40.360 --> 46:42.386
You have a nice day.

47:06.380 --> 47:08.362
- I want 20's innit.
- No, I don't got it.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.386
- Hey you, man!
- Catch him!

47:28.180 --> 47:30.362
- And don't embarrass me.
- Tommy, man.

47:30.480 --> 47:32.362
So, what's the mission, bruv?

47:32.450 --> 47:34.386
All I want you to do is go in
the youth league and listen.

47:34.540 --> 47:35.386
Ah, Swear.

47:35.450 --> 47:38.386
I need to find out why the
mullah fell out with Rana.

47:38.450 --> 47:40.386
- Sick, fam. That's sick.
- All right, take it easy.

47:40.450 --> 47:43.386
What you say, grandpa?
What you say? Good, yeah?

47:44.350 --> 47:46.386
The main thing is listen, Avid.

47:46.400 --> 47:49.386
Black geezers a threat,
white geezers a threat.

47:49.400 --> 47:51.386
But Pakis can be invisible,
even to each other.

47:51.450 --> 47:55.286
You need to ease up on that "Paki"
shit. It's not cool, you know.

47:55.330 --> 47:58.286
All right, so listen, tomorrow
at 5, yeah? Somali cafe.

47:58.330 --> 47:59.686
Watch and listen.

47:59.800 --> 48:02.586
Remember, you're undercover.
Aight, man.

48:02.630 --> 48:04.586
So, hold it down.
Say nuttin.

48:09.630 --> 48:12.416
What the fuck, man!
I warned you, blud!

48:43.330 --> 48:45.386
It's what's gonna happen here.

48:45.430 --> 48:46.386
Let me show you the interiors, yeah?

48:49.230 --> 48:50.386
Fuck me. Tommy!

48:52.880 --> 48:54.386
Thought I'd come around
and have a look for myself.

48:55.430 --> 48:57.386
How'd you pay for all this?

48:57.430 --> 48:58.806
Business is nice, bruvah.

49:00.430 --> 49:02.386
Look. What do you think, huh?

49:02.430 --> 49:04.386
24 apartments and townhouses.

49:04.430 --> 49:07.686
2 and 3 beds. 40 minutes
from the sea, yeah?

49:07.900 --> 49:11.386
American architecture.
Swedish interiors.

49:11.430 --> 49:13.486
- Polish pullers.
- Yeah.

49:13.830 --> 49:16.686
Hey, man, our manor's going down.
This the regeneration, yeah?

49:16.930 --> 49:19.386
You got to get the drugs
off the street for that.

49:19.430 --> 49:21.386
Oh, hopefully this will get
the drugs off the street.

49:21.430 --> 49:24.686
'Cause we're trapped in a
better class of person, Tommy.

49:24.930 --> 49:26.386
Better than you and me?

49:26.430 --> 49:29.386
Fuck, no, sorry, man.
You found the Russian girl?

49:29.430 --> 49:30.686
No, but I wanted
to show you this.

49:31.830 --> 49:33.686
- What am I looking at?
- Look a bit closer.

49:36.330 --> 49:37.886
- Is that Raven Rec?
- Yeah.

49:38.030 --> 49:39.386
Fuck me, man.
Raven Rec.

49:39.430 --> 49:40.986
That brings back memories.

49:42.330 --> 49:44.386
I reckon her sister
is on the estate.

49:45.330 --> 49:48.386
- Fuck.
- I'm on it. All right?

49:49.330 --> 49:51.386
- We need to go. Very sorry.
- Good to meet you.

49:51.730 --> 49:54.386
- Gentlemen.
- I'll be in touch. All right?

49:54.930 --> 49:57.386
- Get home safe, yeah?
- Okay.

50:01.130 --> 50:04.386
- Hey, you gonna sort me out one of them?
- Yeah.

50:04.430 --> 50:07.386
- Maybe.
- I'll hold you to that.

50:36.030 --> 50:39.386
- Yes, Tommy man! You made it.
- There you are, Lovely.

50:40.330 --> 50:41.386
Come on, Tommy.

50:42.330 --> 50:47.386
We got burgers, we got hotdogs,
beer, whatever you want.

50:48.330 --> 50:50.386
- Where's Shelley?
- Oh, there's Tommy.

50:51.330 --> 50:53.386
Stuart gonna go crazy
if they see you together.

50:53.630 --> 50:54.886
Lay off, man.

51:25.430 --> 51:26.686
Double Turk, no ice.

51:54.830 --> 51:57.486
Tunde, right? You know
a pro named Natasha?

51:57.830 --> 52:00.486
- Comes here a lot. Russian.
- Who the fuck are you?

52:04.130 --> 52:06.486
DS Saha. Special branch.

52:09.130 --> 52:12.386
You're not a cop. Stick
fancy dilly's fake ID's a cop.

52:12.430 --> 52:15.386
No, Brixton Market.
I'm a friend of Melody's.

52:15.430 --> 52:17.386
Fuck off. Before I have
your legs broken.

52:17.830 --> 52:19.386
There's a good chap.

52:28.130 --> 52:30.686
Hi, where's Tunde?

52:31.130 --> 52:34.486
- Sorry?
- Tunde, this is his table.

52:36.130 --> 52:37.486
Sorry, this is our table.

52:39.130 --> 52:40.186
Have a seat.

53:18.030 --> 53:19.386
You all right, mate?
Save me some.

53:20.030 --> 53:21.686
You taking the fucking piss?

53:21.886 --> 53:22.686
What do you want?

53:22.886 --> 53:25.886
- Mate, I just wanna talk.
- I don't wanna talk.

53:37.086 --> 53:38.486
- You know a Natasha?
- Yeah.

53:38.686 --> 53:40.486
You know a Melody.
They come in here a lot?

53:40.886 --> 53:43.486
- So who else was here that night?
- I don't know.

53:43.886 --> 53:44.986
Oh, another dude.

53:45.086 --> 53:49.486
I... ask Melody. I seen
him with her before.

53:49.886 --> 53:51.486
One of her regulars.

54:07.786 --> 54:08.686
Waster!

54:09.086 --> 54:10.686
Take that!

54:11.886 --> 54:13.386
Case closed, Akh!

54:14.086 --> 54:15.386
Hey!

54:15.886 --> 54:16.386
Hey!

54:22.086 --> 54:23.686
Are you okay?

54:24.086 --> 54:25.886
Can you get my fags
out of my pocket?

54:26.686 --> 54:29.386
That looks bad. You should go
to hospital for that.

54:30.086 --> 54:31.686
I can't.

54:36.086 --> 54:37.886
I've got a date.

54:46.586 --> 54:47.386
Hey.

54:48.486 --> 54:49.386
Tommy.

54:53.686 --> 54:56.286
Wild Turkey. I got it
from my dad's cupboard.

54:57.086 --> 54:59.686
I think it's whiskey.

55:00.686 --> 55:01.686
Are you drunk?

55:02.086 --> 55:03.686
A little bit.

55:07.086 --> 55:08.386
I love it out here.

55:09.086 --> 55:11.386
No one giving you grief.

55:11.786 --> 55:13.386
Telling you who
you're supposed to be.

55:16.286 --> 55:20.386
She got with him. He's
going out with her. She's a...

55:22.286 --> 55:24.386
slag. He...

55:28.286 --> 55:29.386
Whatever.

55:35.286 --> 55:36.686
I'm cold.

55:37.086 --> 55:38.486
Do you want my jacket?

55:39.086 --> 55:40.486
Put your arm around me.

55:53.286 --> 55:54.386
Um, excuse me sir,
can I help you?

55:54.486 --> 55:56.386
Yeah, I'm here to see
Shelley Stevens.

55:56.486 --> 55:57.386
It's okay, it's okay.

55:59.486 --> 56:01.386
Jesus, Tommy.

56:01.686 --> 56:02.386
Sorry, I'm late.

56:02.686 --> 56:04.386
What hap...
Come in here. Sit down.

56:12.686 --> 56:14.386
Can't say I don't
make an effort.

56:14.486 --> 56:15.386
No.

56:16.086 --> 56:18.886
You're gonna need space where
you need to get that stitched.

56:19.006 --> 56:20.886
I'll be all right.

56:23.086 --> 56:24.486
Do you feel confused?

56:24.686 --> 56:26.386
Not more than usual.

56:30.086 --> 56:32.386
Look at us.
What?

56:33.086 --> 56:35.386
- We're old.
- Oi, speak for yourself.

56:39.986 --> 56:41.486
What happened to us?

56:43.986 --> 56:45.386
I dunno, you left.

56:45.906 --> 56:48.386
- What was I supposed to do?
- I dunno. Stay?

56:49.006 --> 56:51.086
Miss Stevens?
Yeah, it's okay, I'll lock up.

56:51.406 --> 56:52.886
Thanks.

57:07.006 --> 57:08.686
Where did that come from?

57:09.206 --> 57:11.386
'97

57:14.906 --> 57:17.386
It's confusing. This way.

57:17.406 --> 57:19.386
You don't have a clue, do you?
You don't even work here.

57:19.806 --> 57:22.486
I do work here.
I've been here for months.

57:22.606 --> 57:25.686
I know exactly what I'm doing.
Come on.

57:27.206 --> 57:29.686
- I don't have a key. Do you?
- No, I've got it.

57:32.206 --> 57:34.686
Oh, it's the wrong thing...

57:37.006 --> 57:38.686
Okay, this is it.

57:44.206 --> 57:46.386
- We're gonna go wake 'em up.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

57:51.806 --> 57:52.386
- Nice.
- Yeah.

57:53.006 --> 57:54.386
- Wow.
- Yeah.

57:58.406 --> 58:00.386
Is this how you roll, then?

58:00.906 --> 58:02.386
This is how I roll now.

59:23.806 --> 59:25.386
- You know, right?
- I know.

59:27.006 --> 59:31.286
I can't. Stuart.

59:32.806 --> 59:34.086
You've got to break off first.

59:36.806 --> 59:38.386
I told you, you're a strange boy.

59:38.606 --> 59:41.086
- I'm sorry.
- No.

59:42.406 --> 59:44.286
It's why I like you.

59:47.406 --> 59:49.286
<i>Riding the overground,</i>

59:50.406 --> 59:52.286
<i>dreaming away.</i>

59:53.406 --> 59:55.286
<i>They seem to stare at me,</i>

59:55.606 --> 59:58.286
<i>at first start looking away.</i>

59:58.606 --> 01:00:00.286
<i>Voice deep in my head.</i>

01:00:05.286 --> 01:00:06.286
<i>Simmer down.</i>

01:00:09.286 --> 01:00:10.286
<i>Simmer down.</i>

01:00:17.086 --> 01:00:20.386
<i>For as long as I can remember,
she was all that mattered.</i>

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:25.386
<i>But the last time we kissed,
our world fell apart.</i>

01:00:28.086 --> 01:00:30.386
<i>Would it be any
easier this time?</i>

01:00:32.086 --> 01:00:34.386
<i>I wanted to stick around
and find out, but</i>

01:00:34.486 --> 01:00:36.486
<i>I had a girl to find
and a murder to solve.</i>

01:00:39.486 --> 01:00:41.386
<i>Death weighs heavier
than heartbreak.</i>

01:01:00.086 --> 01:01:01.286
<i>Simmer down.</i>

01:01:03.286 --> 01:01:04.286
<i>Simmer down.</i>

01:01:21.286 --> 01:01:25.486
Mate, you didn't see a Moroccan
kid comin' in here about 14-15?

01:01:25.586 --> 01:01:28.286
- No.
- Get him back.

01:01:28.486 --> 01:01:29.386
Kick him, fam.

01:01:31.486 --> 01:01:32.386
I'll take that.

01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:38.386
Waste, man!

01:01:40.086 --> 01:01:41.386
We fucked him up, all right.

01:01:47.086 --> 01:01:48.486
All right!

01:01:52.386 --> 01:01:53.386
What do you say?
Me sayin'?

01:01:54.386 --> 01:01:56.386
I'll have one of these
and a coke?

01:01:57.086 --> 01:01:58.386
I'll have the same, thanks.

01:02:02.486 --> 01:02:03.686
What?

01:02:05.186 --> 01:02:07.386
Do you think you're
Batman or something?

01:02:07.486 --> 01:02:09.386
We're out on the street, fam.

01:02:09.486 --> 01:02:11.186
Chasin' out the smack dealers, bruv.

01:02:11.286 --> 01:02:12.486
What's wrong with that?

01:02:12.586 --> 01:02:13.886
Where's next? Syria?

01:02:15.086 --> 01:02:17.386
Hey, listen.
Sit down.

01:02:18.886 --> 01:02:20.386
Fam, you know what they told me?

01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:21.486
Empires rise and fall.

01:02:21.886 --> 01:02:23.486
And this one's gonna fall.

01:02:23.586 --> 01:02:26.386
Thank you.
Which empire is it, exactly?

01:02:26.586 --> 01:02:31.386
The West, blud. Babylon.
Historical diuretic.

01:02:32.086 --> 01:02:33.386
You takin' a piss?

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:37.386
So, what's the deal?

01:02:37.586 --> 01:02:39.786
Man, found out some
gooky shit, you know.

01:02:40.086 --> 01:02:43.386
Apparently, the mullah knew
that Rana was involved in drugs.

01:02:43.486 --> 01:02:46.386
I even heard them man talkin'
about security video.

01:02:47.086 --> 01:02:49.386
I'll see if I can
find out more, innit.

01:02:50.086 --> 01:02:52.186
- Gonna go now, fam.
- All right.

01:02:52.286 --> 01:02:54.486
Av, don't get nicked.

01:02:54.886 --> 01:02:55.786
Shut up.

01:03:06.486 --> 01:03:08.486
I saw the youth league before.

01:03:09.086 --> 01:03:12.386
They kind of scare people?
Patrols, vigilantes, all that?

01:03:12.686 --> 01:03:13.486
Well, let me tell you.

01:03:13.586 --> 01:03:16.386
Last 9 months, drugs
take down the whole area.

01:03:17.086 --> 01:03:21.386
Youth league is not the problem.
Drugs is a problem.

01:03:22.086 --> 01:03:25.386
They drive out the dealers,
it's okay with me.

01:03:25.786 --> 01:03:26.386
Thank you.

01:04:27.086 --> 01:04:30.386
What's your interest in
the Islamic Youth League?

01:04:30.486 --> 01:04:32.386
Same as everyone else.

01:04:33.086 --> 01:04:35.386
I'm in it for the biryani.

01:04:37.786 --> 01:04:39.386
They're just kids aren't they?

01:04:39.586 --> 01:04:43.386
Kids who are tied to all kinds of 
terrorist activities here and overseas.

01:04:44.086 --> 01:04:48.386
Usman Rana was bankrolled
by the illegal drugs trade.

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:51.386
He was a dangerous man.

01:04:51.486 --> 01:04:52.586
Is that why you killed him?

01:04:59.086 --> 01:05:00.386
I wanna show you somethin'.

01:05:02.086 --> 01:05:04.386
Here's Rana in action.

01:05:05.586 --> 01:05:08.386
<i>Britain is not your home.</i>

01:05:08.486 --> 01:05:12.386
<i>Join us. The Prophet is our
leader. Jihad is our way.</i>

01:05:12.586 --> 01:05:15.186
<i>- Takbir! Takbir!
- Allahu Akbar!</i>

01:05:19.086 --> 01:05:21.386
These are terrorists, Mr. Akhtar.

01:05:23.226 --> 01:05:26.686
You know, a wise man
once told me...

01:05:28.026 --> 01:05:29.586
"They only call it terrorism...

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:32.586
when they don't know who did it.

01:05:32.826 --> 01:05:34.586
Or when they did it themselves."

01:05:41.126 --> 01:05:44.786
Are you sure you didn't take
anything from that hotel room?

01:05:48.726 --> 01:05:49.586
Okay.

01:05:52.026 --> 01:05:54.186
We'll play this your way.

01:06:05.026 --> 01:06:06.386
Bring him.

01:06:17.026 --> 01:06:19.386
Got another stiff.

01:06:20.026 --> 01:06:22.386
Time of death, unknown
I'm at Raven Rec

01:06:32.226 --> 01:06:34.386
Here's the Russian
you've been looking for.

01:06:39.226 --> 01:06:41.386
Is this what happens
when you get in the way?

01:06:44.126 --> 01:06:46.386
You're done, Mr. Akhtar.

01:06:47.126 --> 01:06:48.386
Is that clear?

01:06:50.326 --> 01:06:51.486
Done.

01:07:00.626 --> 01:07:01.786
We're finished here.

01:07:07.026 --> 01:07:10.386
Melody, it's Tommy.
Give me a call when you get this.

01:07:23.026 --> 01:07:25.386
Melody, come on,
pick up. It's Tommy.

01:07:43.126 --> 01:07:44.486
Hello?

01:07:56.026 --> 01:07:59.086
- Whoa!
- It's you!

01:07:59.126 --> 01:08:00.686
- It's me!
- Why didn't you say something?

01:08:00.726 --> 01:08:02.386
I said hello!
I've been trying to call you.

01:08:03.026 --> 01:08:05.386
- What?
- Fuck. They're following me.

01:08:06.026 --> 01:08:09.086
Natasha.
I saw her on the news.

01:08:09.626 --> 01:08:12.286
- Who? Who's following you?
- I don't know.

01:08:16.026 --> 01:08:18.086
Help me. Fuck!

01:08:18.126 --> 01:08:19.886
Why should I, if you're not
straight with me.

01:08:20.326 --> 01:08:21.386
What?

01:08:21.725 --> 01:08:24.386
I know there was someone else
at the club that night.

01:08:24.526 --> 01:08:25.386
Who was it?

01:08:28.225 --> 01:08:30.386
Who was it? A name.

01:08:30.526 --> 01:08:31.386
I need your punter's name.

01:08:34.326 --> 01:08:36.386
He's not a punter.

01:08:38.126 --> 01:08:39.286
He's my boyfriend.

01:08:39.725 --> 01:08:42.286
It's...
Hafiz.

01:08:44.326 --> 01:08:45.685
Lovely.

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:53.286
I'm so sorry I lied to you.
But he just...

01:08:53.386 --> 01:08:54.386
He said to keep
him out of it.

01:08:54.586 --> 01:08:56.486
Look, it's all right.
Let's just go.

01:09:02.185 --> 01:09:03.786
It's fine.

01:09:40.185 --> 01:09:42.586
Come on, come on!
Okay! I'm coming!

01:09:48.386 --> 01:09:50.586
I can't, Tommy!
Come on!

01:10:01.386 --> 01:10:04.486
Come on, let's go!
Did you see him? Is he gone?

01:10:39.086 --> 01:10:42.386
Dad! Uh... Melody.
Melody, Farzad.

01:10:42.586 --> 01:10:44.386
Why aren't you
wearing your shoes?

01:10:45.086 --> 01:10:47.386
Why aren't you wearing your
trousers, Mr. Akhtar?

01:10:48.386 --> 01:10:50.386
Quite so, my dear.

01:10:53.086 --> 01:10:55.086
<i>Thank you so much for
letting me stay, Mr. Akhtar.</i>

01:10:55.186 --> 01:10:56.486
<i>I'm not putting you out, am I?</i>

01:10:56.786 --> 01:11:02.186
<i>Not in the least. But I
insist you call me Farzad.</i>

01:11:07.086 --> 01:11:12.286
<i>It's not a genuine sweep, since
he changes his grip on the bat.</i>

01:11:12.486 --> 01:11:16.286
In fact it's more a
genuine left hand shot.

01:11:16.486 --> 01:11:18.286
- D'you see? D'you see?
- Yeah.

01:11:18.386 --> 01:11:22.086
There's nothing outside.
I think we're good.

01:11:22.186 --> 01:11:24.286
I'm gonna go to bed then.

01:11:25.086 --> 01:11:26.386
Sleep tight.

01:11:27.086 --> 01:11:30.386
And may you have the
sweetest dreams.

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:33.386
- 'Night.
- 'Night.

01:11:37.186 --> 01:11:39.486
Still you come
to me with a problem.

01:11:39.686 --> 01:11:43.286
That's fine. That's
how it should be.

01:11:43.386 --> 01:11:44.586
All right. It's uh...

01:11:44.686 --> 01:11:46.686
It won't be for long. It's
just a couple of days, okay?

01:11:47.086 --> 01:11:50.186
I confess I'm surprised that
the first woman you bring

01:11:50.286 --> 01:11:52.186
to my house is an
African prostitute.

01:11:52.286 --> 01:11:53.486
Shh... Dad!

01:11:54.886 --> 01:11:56.286
Calm down.

01:12:05.986 --> 01:12:07.486
They're trying to kill her?

01:12:09.086 --> 01:12:10.486
Yeah, it looks like it.

01:12:11.286 --> 01:12:12.386
Who?

01:12:13.386 --> 01:12:14.286
Hmm.

01:12:18.986 --> 01:12:20.386
Fundamentalists.

01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:23.286
Governmental or otherwise.
Fuck knows.

01:12:24.086 --> 01:12:29.286
Maybe, maybe...
someone bowled you a googly.

01:12:30.286 --> 01:12:32.086
What are you talking about?

01:12:32.186 --> 01:12:34.186
Well, a googly is a leg break
and it spins the other way.

01:12:34.286 --> 01:12:37.286
But the real success of a googly...

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:40.686
Is that it gets into
the batsman's head.

01:12:42.086 --> 01:12:45.286
So... What's in your head,
Tommy boy?

01:13:40.186 --> 01:13:41.586
That's a lot of cheddar.

01:13:49.086 --> 01:13:51.386
That's half of fucking East Acton.

01:13:57.486 --> 01:13:59.386
How's he get them so cheap?

01:14:07.986 --> 01:14:09.886
I'm Emma.

01:14:10.086 --> 01:14:11.486
Shelley's daughter.

01:14:14.986 --> 01:14:16.786
We've met at the cemetery.

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:18.286
Have a seat.

01:14:21.086 --> 01:14:24.286
I wanted do ask you
about my dad.

01:14:26.986 --> 01:14:29.386
Um... Does you mum
know you're here?

01:14:29.586 --> 01:14:31.386
She won't talk about him.

01:14:32.386 --> 01:14:34.386
She never talks about him.

01:14:35.186 --> 01:14:37.286
She says it's better that way.

01:14:43.186 --> 01:14:44.486
I think it's better
if you talked to your mum.

01:14:44.686 --> 01:14:45.686
Please.

01:14:47.186 --> 01:14:49.386
You go to his grave.
You must have been tight.

01:14:57.186 --> 01:14:59.386
- I'm sorry, I just think...
- I'm seventeen.

01:15:02.386 --> 01:15:03.486
Please.

01:15:05.886 --> 01:15:07.486
All right, it was a big gang of us.

01:15:08.086 --> 01:15:09.886
- He is one of us.
<i>- And uh,</i> 

01:15:09.986 --> 01:15:11.286
Supposed to be no
discrimination, innit?

01:15:11.386 --> 01:15:12.586
<i>Stuart was always the top man.</i>

01:15:14.086 --> 01:15:15.386
<i>Everybody loved Stuart.</i>

01:15:22.086 --> 01:15:23.486
He was loyal.

01:15:26.486 --> 01:15:28.986
That if you had grief,
he had your back.

01:15:29.286 --> 01:15:31.386
You Paki cunt!
Fuck you up!

01:15:39.486 --> 01:15:40.386
Hold on!

01:15:51.286 --> 01:15:52.286
Nice one, Stuart!

01:16:00.086 --> 01:16:02.486
Sorry.
Hello?

01:16:02.986 --> 01:16:06.186
<i>It's me, Tommy boy.
Are you coming home?</i>

01:16:06.486 --> 01:16:08.086
I'm really sorry,
I've got to go.

01:16:08.186 --> 01:16:09.386
No, it's fine.

01:16:17.286 --> 01:16:18.286
- Good on you, mate. Well done.
- Well done, Stuart.

01:16:20.586 --> 01:16:21.486
Nice, Stuart.

01:16:22.186 --> 01:16:24.386
You fucking bastard.

01:16:35.186 --> 01:16:36.386
He knows.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:47.386
Hello mate. Yeah.
Double Turk, no ice.

01:18:00.386 --> 01:18:01.386
Hi.

01:18:09.686 --> 01:18:10.986
Are you okay?

01:18:16.486 --> 01:18:17.386
Yeah.

01:18:24.486 --> 01:18:27.686
Do you wanna stay here,
I'll be back in a minute?

01:18:27.986 --> 01:18:28.886
Yeah?

01:19:28.086 --> 01:19:30.386
- What's this?
- Oh, I told you, Tommy boy.

01:19:32.086 --> 01:19:35.086
They won't be satisfied
until we're all gone.

01:19:35.186 --> 01:19:36.386
We're not selling the house.

01:19:36.486 --> 01:19:37.386
Forcing us out.

01:19:37.486 --> 01:19:40.286
If you get any more letters
like this, just tell me.

01:19:40.286 --> 01:19:42.386
What is going on here?

01:19:42.506 --> 01:19:44.386
They're photos of your mum.

01:19:46.186 --> 01:19:49.386
- And you see that? Can you see? Uganda.
- Oh, yeah.

01:19:49.486 --> 01:19:51.286
That was the day we left.

01:19:51.386 --> 01:19:54.386
We had to hide all the
jewelry because uh...

01:19:54.486 --> 01:19:56.486
They would have taken everything.

01:19:56.886 --> 01:20:00.186
Um, I've got to go out today.
Can you stay inside for me, yeah?

01:20:00.286 --> 01:20:01.286
- Yeah. Yeah, we'll be fine.
- All right.

01:20:01.386 --> 01:20:03.386
We get on all right.
Don't we Farzad?

01:20:03.586 --> 01:20:06.286
Ah, famously, my dear.
Famously.

01:20:06.386 --> 01:20:07.386
Happy families.

01:20:07.486 --> 01:20:09.286
When I look at these pictures,
it just breaks my heart.

01:20:09.486 --> 01:20:10.386
Yeah?

01:20:11.186 --> 01:20:16.386
What? No. No, I haven't.
Well, what happened?

01:20:16.586 --> 01:20:18.386
<i>I'm standing outside
Kensal Rise Station</i>

01:20:18.486 --> 01:20:20.386
<i>following a number of
arrests across London,</i>

01:20:20.486 --> 01:20:23.386
<i>for which the mullah is
the most high-profiled.</i>

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:26.386
<i>Tension is building here as
Al-Dabaran supporters are</i>

01:20:26.486 --> 01:20:28.386
<i>demanding his immediate release.</i>

01:20:28.486 --> 01:20:29.586
All right, I'm on my way.

01:20:29.686 --> 01:20:31.586
<i>The security service
states the arrests</i>

01:20:31.686 --> 01:20:34.686
<i>are a result of a 6-month-long
anti-terror investigation.</i>

01:20:57.286 --> 01:20:58.486
Hey, Lovely!

01:20:59.186 --> 01:21:00.386
Lovely, man!

01:21:00.586 --> 01:21:03.386
Whoa, whoa, he's with me. What are
you doing here? It's all good.

01:21:03.786 --> 01:21:05.386
Mr. Ansari.

01:21:05.786 --> 01:21:08.386
Look you can't trust
these spooks, man.

01:21:12.086 --> 01:21:13.386
Free the mullah!

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:17.086
Keep it brief. Tell them he'll
be released after questioning.

01:21:17.286 --> 01:21:19.386
It's payback. Get this
crowd under control.

01:21:20.286 --> 01:21:23.086
Free the mullah!
Free him!

01:21:23.286 --> 01:21:25.286
Brothers, you all know me.

01:21:25.386 --> 01:21:29.286
I know you're angry about these
attacks on our community. We all are.

01:21:29.486 --> 01:21:31.286
- Avid.
- Fuck, Tommy man!

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.386
What's going on?

01:21:32.486 --> 01:21:34.286
The mullah found out
what happened to Rana.

01:21:34.386 --> 01:21:36.386
- You sure?
- That's why they cuffed him up.

01:21:38.086 --> 01:21:40.386
I can't talk right now.
I can't be seen with you, man.

01:21:40.886 --> 01:21:42.386
I've seen that guy, you know.

01:21:42.886 --> 01:21:44.386
What guy?

01:21:44.586 --> 01:21:46.386
I saw him in the
security video.

01:21:46.586 --> 01:21:48.386
The mullah's got a
hold of it from someone.

01:21:48.586 --> 01:21:50.386
Meet me outside the youth
center after evening prayers.

01:21:50.486 --> 01:21:52.386
I'll have something
for you by then.

01:21:54.286 --> 01:21:55.386
I got to go.

01:21:58.686 --> 01:22:01.386
Listen, brothers, we've gotta
do this in a calm manner.

01:22:01.886 --> 01:22:03.386
Listen! Brothers, calm down!

01:22:03.886 --> 01:22:05.386
Calm down! Brothers!

01:22:27.686 --> 01:22:29.386
- What up, bro?
- Fuck man!

01:22:29.986 --> 01:22:33.386
Fuckin' hell, Tommy. What the
fuck, man? That's not even funny.

01:22:33.686 --> 01:22:35.386
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it's not. Fuckin' hell.

01:22:35.686 --> 01:22:37.386
Scared the fuckin' hell out of me.

01:22:39.286 --> 01:22:41.386
- What happened to your face?
- I don't even know.

01:22:44.186 --> 01:22:47.386
It's a toss-up between the
spooks and the beard brigade.

01:22:47.486 --> 01:22:50.386
- All right, yeah.
- They're all friends of yours, anyway.

01:22:52.386 --> 01:22:54.386
Um, I know about Melody.

01:22:57.386 --> 01:22:59.286
What, she told you?

01:23:00.886 --> 01:23:02.586
You lied to me, man.

01:23:03.386 --> 01:23:08.386
Well, come on, I didn't lie to
you. I just didn't tell you.

01:23:10.386 --> 01:23:12.386
There's a difference, yeah?

01:23:13.886 --> 01:23:17.386
Seriously, look. She rang me
because Natasha hadn't come back.

01:23:17.686 --> 01:23:20.386
I tried calling Usman because
his phone was off.

01:23:20.686 --> 01:23:23.386
Right. I've got a hooker
calling me at home, Tommy.

01:23:23.686 --> 01:23:25.386
Talking about going to the old bill.

01:23:26.086 --> 01:23:28.886
What would you do? Yeah?

01:23:29.386 --> 01:23:31.886
Yeah. I couldn't have that.

01:23:33.386 --> 01:23:35.386
I didn't think he was dead.

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:40.386
So I just sent that to you, man.
What else am I supposed to do?

01:23:42.186 --> 01:23:44.586
I've got to ask you, man,
did you kill her?

01:23:47.186 --> 01:23:48.486
Fuck off, man.
I'm not even...

01:23:48.886 --> 01:23:50.286
I've got to ask you.

01:23:50.486 --> 01:23:52.586
You! Fuck, Tommy man!

01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:57.486
Fuck. Yeah? We're supposed to be
on the same fucking team. All right?

01:23:58.086 --> 01:24:00.186
Fuckin' hell, man.
It's the Russian, Tommy.

01:24:00.286 --> 01:24:01.986
- It's not the fucking Russian.
- Well, how do you know?

01:24:02.086 --> 01:24:03.386
Because she's fucking dead.

01:24:03.586 --> 01:24:05.386
She got fished out of the
canal last night.

01:24:07.086 --> 01:24:09.386
Look, they're coming after everyone
who was with you at the club.

01:24:11.086 --> 01:24:14.386
Rana's dead. Natasha's dead.
They tried to kill Melody last night.

01:24:15.086 --> 01:24:17.386
Don't worry, she's at Dad's place.

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:19.386
Oh, man.

01:24:20.086 --> 01:24:23.386
Just watch your back, man.
They'll be after you next.

01:25:17.886 --> 01:25:19.386
Come on, Avid, where are you?

01:25:43.886 --> 01:25:45.386
Don't fucking move!

01:25:49.086 --> 01:25:50.286
What happened to you?

01:25:51.286 --> 01:25:53.286
What happened?

01:25:53.486 --> 01:25:54.386
What have you done with Avid?

01:25:54.486 --> 01:25:56.386
- No, no, the light. Turn it off.
- Why?

01:25:56.586 --> 01:25:58.386
- They're right there, they're comin'.
- What?

01:25:59.386 --> 01:26:02.386
Who? Dealers? Feds? Who?

01:26:02.486 --> 01:26:04.486
- Feds. With American accents.
- What?

01:26:05.686 --> 01:26:08.386
They smashed up our computers.
They were looking for something.

01:26:09.086 --> 01:26:11.386
What, you think it's
just a coincidence?

01:26:12.086 --> 01:26:16.386
Mr. Rana brought trouble.
All that caliphate shit.

01:26:17.086 --> 01:26:20.386
They kill him. And now,
they arrest the mullah.

01:26:21.086 --> 01:26:22.586
This is war, bruv.

01:26:24.086 --> 01:26:26.386
They're trying to
destroy our community.

01:26:27.086 --> 01:26:29.486
I don't have time for this.
Where the fuck is Avid?

01:26:30.086 --> 01:26:32.486
Avid?
They got him.

01:26:33.686 --> 01:26:34.886
Sorry.

01:27:03.486 --> 01:27:05.386
I'm looking for Avid.
Avid Elbaz.

01:27:06.186 --> 01:27:08.386
- One moment.
- Avid Elbaz. He's a kid, and...

01:27:10.386 --> 01:27:11.386
Victor.

01:27:15.186 --> 01:27:19.386
- What happened?
- I dunno. Found him in an alley.

01:27:22.186 --> 01:27:23.386
You can't go in there.

01:27:39.186 --> 01:27:40.386
Oi!

01:27:42.186 --> 01:27:43.386
Come on, man.

01:27:43.886 --> 01:27:49.386
Oi, Oi,
T.A. Confidential. Tommy and Avid.

01:28:04.886 --> 01:28:07.286
Excuse me, you can't be in here.

01:28:09.286 --> 01:28:10.486
Mrs. Elbaz.

01:28:10.686 --> 01:28:12.886
Jesus, haven't you done enough?

01:28:13.086 --> 01:28:15.386
I trusted you, Tommy.
You did it.

01:28:15.686 --> 01:28:17.386
I didn't. I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

01:28:17.486 --> 01:28:18.886
You did it.
Get out!

01:28:19.086 --> 01:28:20.386
Get out!

01:28:21.086 --> 01:28:23.286
Get out!

01:29:36.386 --> 01:29:38.286
Fuck who!
Who the fuck!

01:29:41.386 --> 01:29:43.386
Oh, fuck.

01:29:44.086 --> 01:29:46.386
Fuck. Shelley,
sorry, I'm sorry.

01:29:47.086 --> 01:29:48.386
You okay?

01:29:54.086 --> 01:29:55.386
Did she come here?

01:29:57.386 --> 01:29:58.386
What?

01:29:58.586 --> 01:29:59.486
Emma.

01:30:00.286 --> 01:30:01.486
Why didn't you tell me?

01:30:01.786 --> 01:30:04.386
Um, she...asked me not to.

01:30:04.486 --> 01:30:06.386
I'm her mother.
I'm her fucking mother.

01:30:06.986 --> 01:30:09.386
Emma came here. Look what
she could've walked into.

01:30:09.586 --> 01:30:11.086
And you telling
her about Stuart,

01:30:11.286 --> 01:30:13.186
Jesus, Tommy who do
you think you are?

01:30:13.386 --> 01:30:15.686
- Well, he's her dad.
- She's my daughter.

01:30:15.786 --> 01:30:18.286
- So then, talk to her.
- What do I say?

01:30:19.086 --> 01:30:24.186
Um, yeah, your dad was...
a really great guy.

01:30:24.286 --> 01:30:26.186
Trouble is I was in love
with one of his mates

01:30:26.286 --> 01:30:29.486
and that's why he killed...

01:30:33.086 --> 01:30:35.386
- Shelley.
- Oh, God.

01:30:40.286 --> 01:30:41.686
Shelley.

01:30:46.186 --> 01:30:48.386
That's for what, Tommy?

01:30:49.186 --> 01:30:51.386
You gonna try and be her friend
and tell her about Stuart

01:30:51.486 --> 01:30:53.386
and fuck her mum at the hotel.
Is that your plan?

01:30:53.486 --> 01:30:56.386
Because I just need
more than that.

01:30:57.286 --> 01:30:58.686
It's not good enough.

01:31:01.286 --> 01:31:02.386
What do you want?

01:31:06.286 --> 01:31:08.386
Tommy, what do you want?

01:31:26.286 --> 01:31:28.386
I want to know

01:31:30.086 --> 01:31:32.386
why you told Stuart
about you and me.

01:31:35.086 --> 01:31:36.486
Why did you do it?

01:31:38.086 --> 01:31:39.386
Huh?

01:31:41.386 --> 01:31:43.286
I never told him anything.

01:31:43.386 --> 01:31:45.286
Who else would...

01:32:07.286 --> 01:32:09.586
Fuckin' Lovely, then.

01:32:13.186 --> 01:32:14.486
Lovely.

01:32:17.286 --> 01:32:19.386
Fuckin' Lovely.

01:32:20.386 --> 01:32:23.686
Do you know, it was only you
who ever called him that?

01:32:30.286 --> 01:32:33.386
Shelley. I'm sorry.
Shelley.

01:32:33.586 --> 01:32:36.386
Please, Tom. Stop.

01:32:36.486 --> 01:32:37.686
Shelley.

01:33:37.286 --> 01:33:39.486
Why, it's another life, isn't it?

01:33:41.086 --> 01:33:42.586
You need to let it go though.

01:33:47.086 --> 01:33:48.386
Get down, Stu.

01:33:48.586 --> 01:33:50.386
I know they've been
going on behind your back

01:33:50.486 --> 01:33:51.486
but you gotta let it go.

01:33:51.686 --> 01:33:53.486
What are you doing, man?

01:33:53.686 --> 01:33:55.486
Tommy fuckin' Akhtar.

01:33:55.686 --> 01:33:57.486
You're supposed to be my friend.

01:33:57.686 --> 01:33:59.486
- Fuck you.
- Stuart!

01:34:03.086 --> 01:34:06.786
I'm the real deal.
The real fuckin' deal.

01:34:06.886 --> 01:34:08.486
And I loved you.

01:34:10.086 --> 01:34:11.486
I'm sorry.

01:34:13.886 --> 01:34:15.486
Stuart!

01:34:15.686 --> 01:34:16.486
Stu!

01:34:22.686 --> 01:34:23.786
No!

01:35:33.886 --> 01:35:36.386
<i>By the time you see this,
I will no doubt, be detained.</i>

01:35:37.086 --> 01:35:39.386
<i>The security services aren't
interested in the truth.</i>

01:35:41.086 --> 01:35:42.386
<i>But they are right
about one thing.</i>

01:35:43.086 --> 01:35:47.386
<i>The network of our brothers is even
more extensive than even they dare to fear.</i>

01:35:49.086 --> 01:35:51.386
<i>I entrust this security
video to our young brother.</i>

01:35:52.086 --> 01:35:55.386
<i>In the hope that you can
see that justice is served.</i>

01:35:56.086 --> 01:36:01.386
<i>No one knows what is hidden from
them as a reward for their good deeds.</i>

01:36:24.086 --> 01:36:26.386
They're coming after everyone
who was with you at the club.

01:36:27.086 --> 01:36:29.386
Melody's at Dad's place.

01:36:38.086 --> 01:36:40.386
Pick up, Dad. Please!

01:36:48.886 --> 01:36:50.386
- Dad, Dad...
- Tommy boy!

01:36:51.486 --> 01:36:52.386
Dad.

01:36:53.086 --> 01:36:54.386
We had nothing in, Tommy boy.
01:36:54,486 --> 01:36:56,286
I might thought she'd
like some breakfast.

01:36:56.386 --> 01:36:58.386
Dad, there's someone at the house.
You've got to get out of here.

01:36:58.486 --> 01:37:00.386
- In the house?
- Yeah. Can you do that for me?

01:37:02.386 --> 01:37:04.386
Just go. Okay?

01:37:22.386 --> 01:37:24.386
Let me go! Let me go!

01:37:24.686 --> 01:37:26.386
You fuck! Let me go!

01:37:45.186 --> 01:37:47.386
We've got to get on
with our lives, Tommy.

01:37:51.186 --> 01:37:53.386
We've got to let it go.

01:37:58.186 --> 01:38:00.386
- We gonna do this, or what?
- Easy, man. Fuckin' hell.

01:38:00.486 --> 01:38:03.286
Please, wait, wait.
Wait.

01:38:03.486 --> 01:38:05.386
No, no, please.

01:38:06.386 --> 01:38:08.386
- I don't know anything.
- You let me down, babe.

01:38:08.486 --> 01:38:11.386
I didn't say anything.
I didn't speak to anyone.

01:38:11.586 --> 01:38:15.386
- Are we doing this, or what?
- Just wait, man. For fucks sake.

01:38:16.086 --> 01:38:18.086
- Wait, Tommy.
- Hafiz, what?

01:38:18.186 --> 01:38:19.386
Shut the fuck up.

01:38:20.186 --> 01:38:21.386
Tommy, man...

01:38:22.086 --> 01:38:25.386
Why couldn't you stop yourself
from fucking going on, man?

01:38:26.086 --> 01:38:29.386
Listen, it's not about
fucking religion.

01:38:31.086 --> 01:38:33.386
Drugs drive down the prices
and we buy the real estate.

01:38:33.486 --> 01:38:34.386
Yeah?

01:38:37.086 --> 01:38:38.386
Everybody wins.

01:38:39.086 --> 01:38:41.386
Rana just got too greedy.

01:38:41.886 --> 01:38:44.186
This is our manor, Lovely.
What the fuck are you doing?

01:38:44.286 --> 01:38:47.186
Fuck our manor, Tommy.
It's a shithole.

01:38:47.286 --> 01:38:48.386
- Come on.
- Wait, man.

01:38:50.086 --> 01:38:52.386
- You don't have to do this
- No, listen to me, bruvah.

01:38:58.286 --> 01:38:59.386
I'm sorry.

01:39:00.086 --> 01:39:02.286
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Tommy?

01:39:03.086 --> 01:39:05.286
Are you home?

01:39:06.086 --> 01:39:07.386
- Dad?
- Sit.

01:39:15.086 --> 01:39:21.386
Hafiz Ansari.
You're a disgrace to your family.

01:39:22.086 --> 01:39:24.186
And you, you white bloody bugga.

01:39:24.286 --> 01:39:26.386
I seen your type before.

01:39:27.086 --> 01:39:29.186
- Dad
- Sit down!

01:39:29.286 --> 01:39:30.386
I'm not scared of you!

01:39:39.286 --> 01:39:41.386
King's African Rifles.

01:39:41.486 --> 01:39:42.386
Dad.

01:39:43.486 --> 01:39:47.386
I told you I was ready
for them, Tommy boy.

01:39:48.386 --> 01:39:50.386
This time, I am.

01:39:50.486 --> 01:39:52.386
My house.

01:39:55.486 --> 01:39:57.386
My son.

01:39:59.086 --> 01:40:00.586
Dad.

01:40:02.786 --> 01:40:03.686
Dad.

01:40:05.086 --> 01:40:06.686
Your off stump.

01:40:13.086 --> 01:40:14.386
The moral compass.

01:40:15.086 --> 01:40:17.386
Tommy, I'm sorry, man. I'm...

01:40:21.086 --> 01:40:23.386
You covered up a fuckin' murder.
You stay here.

01:40:25.086 --> 01:40:26.486
Fucking Yanks.

01:40:30.486 --> 01:40:31.886
You all right, Cal?

01:40:32.186 --> 01:40:34.486
- You ready for the spooks?
- Go on, then.

01:40:41.186 --> 01:40:43.286
<i>Turns out the spooks didn't
give a toss that he killed Rana.</i>

01:40:47.186 --> 01:40:50.386
<i>They were only after his contacts
so they could take down Rana's network.</i>

01:40:51.186 --> 01:40:53.186
<i>As long as Lovely kept
feeding them information,</i>

01:40:53.286 --> 01:40:55.386
<i>they were willing to protect him.</i>

01:40:58.186 --> 01:41:01.386
<i>They just couldn't believe the mullah only
wanted to get the drugs off the street.</i>

01:41:22.186 --> 01:41:27.286
<i>As for me, I mean, I can't see
myself in one of them posh new flats.</i>

01:41:28.986 --> 01:41:31.286
<i>But I have acquired a new family.</i>

01:41:31.986 --> 01:41:34.286
Dad, this is Emma.
I told you about.

01:41:34.886 --> 01:41:38.086
- Come in, Merry Christmas.
- Avid, Mrs. Elzad's son.

01:41:39.086 --> 01:41:41.086
Merry Christmas, Tommy boy.

01:41:41.186 --> 01:41:43.086
- How you doing?
- Yes, I'm fine. Come on in.

01:41:44.186 --> 01:41:46.086
Everyone, lets...

01:41:49.186 --> 01:41:50.086
What do you think?

01:41:50.186 --> 01:41:52.086
I think we need that um,
army outfit.

01:41:52.186 --> 01:41:55.186
- You know, the bullet belt, boots, boobs.
- Oh, right. Yeah.

01:41:55.286 --> 01:41:56.386
- Yeah, Farzad will have a heart attack.
- Fuck off, Tommy.

01:41:56.486 --> 01:41:58.186
What have we got here?

01:41:58.286 --> 01:42:00.386
Yeah, sort the sprouts out.
Make yourself useful.

01:42:03.286 --> 01:42:05.386
Wow, Melody, this looks amazing.

01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:09.386
Actually, it's Laura.

01:42:13.286 --> 01:42:16.386
- Laura.
- Yeah.

01:42:17.086 --> 01:42:21.386
There it goes. I was just speaking of.
Hope you're all very hungry.

01:42:21.586 --> 01:42:25.286
Wonderful, wonderful. Which bit
did you want me to cut first?

01:42:25.486 --> 01:42:28.286
- I think the breast.
- I usually come to them later.

01:42:29.286 --> 01:42:33.286
Bugga shite! Pardon my French,
we're missing the Queen.

01:42:33.286 --> 01:42:35.386
Yeah, this... okay.

01:42:35.486 --> 01:42:39.386
<i>Our Lord was not born
into a traditional family.</i>

01:42:51.286 --> 01:42:54.286
- Hey, sorry I couldn't get away.
- It's all right.

01:42:54.686 --> 01:42:56.286
What are you doing?

01:43:03.186 --> 01:43:05.386
Making up for lost time.

01:43:08.186 --> 01:43:09.186
Now, come on, I'm starving.

01:43:09.286 --> 01:43:10.186
Look who I found.

01:43:10.286 --> 01:43:11.286
Hello.

01:43:12.286 --> 01:43:14.186
Lovely to see you.

01:43:16.086 --> 01:43:19.186
- God bless us, everyone.
- Cheers.

01:43:19.286 --> 01:43:20.886
Merry Christmas.

01:43:21.386 --> 01:43:24.386
Merry Christmas.

01:43:36.086 --> 01:43:40.386
<i>Well, it's not exactly happy families.
But it never is.</i>

01:43:41.086 --> 01:43:44.386
<i>But we've laid some ghosts to rest.</i>

01:43:45.186 --> 01:43:46.386
<i>We could leave some space for now.</i>

01:43:48.086 --> 01:43:52.386
<i>But will it take? Will it last?
I dunno.</i>

01:43:54.086 --> 01:43:56.486
<i>We just jump in and
do the best we can.</i>

01:44:17.186 --> 01:44:20.186
<i>This ain't the down,
it's the upbeat, make it complete</i>

01:44:20.386 --> 01:44:24.186
<i>So what's the story,
guaranteed accuracy, enhanced CD</i>

01:44:24.386 --> 01:44:27.186
<i>Latest technology,
darts at treble twenty</i>

01:44:27.386 --> 01:44:30.186
<i>Huge non-recoupable advance,
majors be vigilant</i>

01:44:31.186 --> 01:44:33.186
<i>I excel in both content and deliverance</i>

01:44:33.286 --> 01:44:36.186
<i>So let's put on our classics and
we'll have a little dance, shall we?</i>

01:44:37.186 --> 01:44:39.186
<i>No sales pitch, no media hype</i>

01:44:39.286 --> 01:44:41.186
<i>No hydro, it's nice and ripe</i>

01:44:41.286 --> 01:44:43.186
<i>I speak in communications in bold type</i>

01:44:44.286 --> 01:44:46.186
<i>This ain't your archetypal street sound</i>

01:44:46.286 --> 01:44:47.986
<i>Scan for ultrasound</i>

01:44:48.086 --> 01:44:50.186
<i>North, South, East, West and all round</i>

01:44:50.286 --> 01:44:51.186
<i>And then to the Underground</i>

01:44:51.286 --> 01:44:54.186
<i>You say that everything sounds the same</i>

01:44:54.286 --> 01:44:57.186
<i>And then you go buy them</i>

01:44:57.286 --> 01:45:01.186
<i>There's no excuses, my friend</i>

01:45:02.286 --> 01:45:05.186
<i>Let's push things forward</i>

01:45:05.286 --> 01:45:09.186

<i>Let's push things forward</i>

01:45:19.286 --> 01:45:21.186
<i>As we progress to the check point</i>

01:45:21.286 --> 01:45:23.186
<i>I wholeheartedly agree
with your viewpoint</i>

01:45:23.286 --> 01:45:25.186
<i>But this ain't your typical garage joint</i>

01:45:25.286 --> 01:45:27.186
<i>I make points which hold significance</i>

01:45:27.486 --> 01:45:29.186
<i>That ain't a bag it's a shipment</i>

01:45:30.286 --> 01:45:33.186
<i>This ain't a track,
it's a movement, I got the settlement</i>

01:45:33.286 --> 01:45:36.186
<i>My frequencies are transient
and resonate your eardrums</i>

01:45:36.286 --> 01:45:40.186
<i>I make bangers not anthems,
leave that to the Artful Dodger</i>

01:45:40.286 --> 01:45:43.186
<i>The broad shouldered fifty-one
percent shareholder</i>

01:45:43.286 --> 01:45:45.186
<i>You won't find us on Alta Vista</i>

01:45:45.286 --> 01:45:49.186
<i>Cult classic not bestseller,
you're gonna need more power</i>

01:45:49.286 --> 01:45:52.186
<i>Plug in the free phase and
the generator, crank it up to gigawatts</i>

01:45:52.286 --> 01:45:55.186
<i>Critics, ready with your
pot shots, the plot thickens</i>

01:45:55.286 --> 01:45:58.186
<i>Put on your mittens for
these sub zero conditions</i>

01:45:58.286 --> 01:46:01.186
<i>But remember I'm just spitting,
remember I'm just spitting</i>

01:46:01.286 --> 01:46:04.186
<i>Once bitten, forever smitten</i>

01:46:04.486 --> 01:46:08.186
<i>You say that everything sounds the same</i>

01:46:08.286 --> 01:46:11.186

Eastern riches, junkie fixes</i>

01:46:36.286 --> 01:46:38.186
<i>Around here we say
'birds', not bitches</i>

01:46:38.286 --> 01:46:42.186
<i>As London Bridge burns down
Brixton's burning up</i>

01:46:42.286 --> 01:46:45.186
<i>Turns out your in luck, I knows
this dodgy fuck in the Duck</i>

01:46:45.286 --> 01:46:49.186
<i>So it's just another show flick
for your local city poet</i>

<i>In case you geezers don't know it,
let's push things forward</i>

01:46:52.286 --> 01:46:55.186

calling all maulers</i>

01:46:55.286 --> 01:47:00.186
<i>Back street brawlers,
corner shop crawlers, victory's flawless</i>

01:47:00.286 --> 01:47:02.186
<i>Love us or hates us but don't slate us</i>

01:47:02.286 --> 01:47:06.186
<i>Don't conform to formulas,
pop genres and such</i>

01:47:06.286 --> 01:47:09.186
<i>Sharp darts, double dutch,
parked cars troubles you much</i>

01:47:09.286 --> 01:47:14.186
