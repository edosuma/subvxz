WEBVTT

00:03.304 --> 00:04.837
Ooh, hot date?

00:04.839 --> 00:08.107
Ravi's taking me out
for our eight month-aversary.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.508
Aw, so romantic!

00:09.510 --> 00:10.376
Yeah.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.576
It's just I forgot
it was tonight,

00:11.645 --> 00:13.178
So I didn't dress
for it.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.213
Oh, that's easy.
Put a belt on.

00:15.215 --> 00:16.748
What?

00:16.817 --> 00:18.216
Uh, belt that jumpah!

00:18.218 --> 00:20.652
If I've learned anything
from<i> teen vogue</i> it's that

00:20.688 --> 00:23.188
Any regular outfit can be
high fashion with a belt.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.058
Here.
(nervous chuckling)

00:26.193 --> 00:27.726
Voila.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.328
Veterinarian chic.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.596
I don't think
this works.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.932
Are you kidding?
You're dr. Lara eriksen.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.467
This look screams,

00:35.602 --> 00:38.403
"I'm a badass vet who works
hard and lounges hard."

00:38.472 --> 00:40.339
Well, I guess
it's not the worst.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.507
You see that
confidence there?

00:41.509 --> 00:42.674
That's the power
of a belt.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.810
It's why they use them
in karate.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.211
Okay. Thank you.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.013
You look amazing.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.148
That's what my grandmother
insisted on being buried in.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.150
We said no.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.486
She's still alive.
She's a planner.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.554
She chose my outfit.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.090
I don't like my boots.

00:59.126 --> 01:00.225
Would you like my top?

01:00.227 --> 01:01.160
Yes! Yes.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.061
Absolutely.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.196
♪ I don't lose my cool ♪

01:04.198 --> 01:08.300
♪ I love to call you mine ♪

01:08.302 --> 01:11.270
♪ and whenever I'm with you
my baby ♪

01:11.405 --> 01:13.338
♪ I keep my fahrenheit ♪

01:14.808 --> 01:17.776
♪ ah-ah-ah-ah
I never lose my cool ♪

01:17.911 --> 01:20.679
I think "no" and "kill shelter"
should be on the same line

01:20.681 --> 01:22.180
Or people might get
the wrong idea.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.515
I guess.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.917
Do you need
to change the bucket?

01:25.986 --> 01:27.386
No, it can handle
a few more drops.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.787
Roofs are the bane
of my existence.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.388
They need to be to code,
waterproof,

01:30.424 --> 01:32.124
And like four other things
I can never remember.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.859
Sorry, I just--
oh my god.

01:33.861 --> 01:34.827
Max!

01:34.962 --> 01:36.027
Hey.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.529
Do you need something?

01:37.565 --> 01:39.264
Uh, yeah. If you're
busy it can wait.

01:39.399 --> 01:40.331
We're busy.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.699
Meeting.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.468
Okay, sorry.
I'll just text you.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.804
Thank you.
Good work.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.240
Liam, he's a
very sweet kid.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.008
I just think we need
a welcoming staff,

01:50.010 --> 01:52.544
Not some prairie cult tween
who's eaten his sister.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.845
Uh, I-I don't have
a sister.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.214
Oh, my god!
I am trying to help you.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.421
Rabbits have a very high
pain threshold,

02:03.457 --> 02:05.624
So little socks
probably barely felt the--

02:05.693 --> 02:07.292
I get why you want
to see him.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.293
Closure.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.628
Where is my lunch?

02:09.697 --> 02:10.629
Okay.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.830
Yeah-- I'm so sorry
for your--

02:12.867 --> 02:13.632
Loss.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.567
It's okay. It's just soup.

02:15.702 --> 02:17.369
Or are you being sarcastic?

02:17.371 --> 02:18.570
No, but I get that
a lot.

02:18.705 --> 02:21.139
People also say I have
a punchable face.

02:21.274 --> 02:22.941
Oh, yeah.
Like a bag to a boxer.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.376
Ah, here it is.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.445
Jeez, nikki.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.513
Would it kill ya
to downsize a bit?

02:28.549 --> 02:31.250
Ah, just toss the boxes.
They're mostly empty.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.317
(chuckling)

02:32.452 --> 02:34.385
There will be blowback.

02:34.421 --> 02:37.922
Well, as acting manager
of animal care

02:37.958 --> 02:38.991
And nikki's supervisor,

02:39.126 --> 02:41.393
I'm happy to share
with her our concerns.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.860
Your concerns.

02:42.897 --> 02:44.495
Conversation,
not confrontation.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.864
As my moms say,

02:45.999 --> 02:47.733
"we can't read your mind,
so use your words."

02:47.735 --> 02:49.067
"and don't
condescend to women."

02:49.069 --> 02:50.535
"and always shop local."

02:50.538 --> 02:51.803
My mom always said,

02:51.805 --> 02:53.805
"don't breastfeed.
It ruins your body."

02:53.807 --> 02:56.741
Which, if I'm bein' honest,
hasn't come up much.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.912
Hello.
Oh, hey jeff.

03:00.047 --> 03:01.279
How are you?
Great.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.313
Uh--
good.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.483
Oh. Hey, shannon.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.551
Oh, no. What did max forget
this time?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.553
Phone charger. I feel
like his errand boy.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.021
I mean, I'm kidding.
He's the boy.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.691
Well, I'll make sure he gets it.
You're a good dad.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.958
Oh, not just a dad.

03:13.994 --> 03:14.893
Right.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.897
Well, have a great day.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.065
You too!

03:20.134 --> 03:21.833
Jeffrey, max told me

03:21.902 --> 03:24.002
That you have some
big plans this weekend.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.436
Did he?

03:25.472 --> 03:26.705
No. Nothing.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.606
Oh, okay.
What about you, shannon?

03:28.642 --> 03:31.577
Any plans,
or weekend wide open?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.111
Uh, guy
over at mckibbin's--

03:33.247 --> 03:35.780
Actually the owner, fergus,
he's hosting an open mic

03:35.816 --> 03:38.916
And apparently he sings
like a dream, so.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.052
I love live music.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.887
I mean, that sounded
like I wanted an invite,

03:42.022 --> 03:42.921
Which-- which I don't.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.391
I should go.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.792
Okay. Bye!

03:49.763 --> 03:51.663
What are you doing?

03:51.699 --> 03:53.198
Getting toner
for the printer.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.933
No, with jeffrey.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.902
He's clearly into you.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.403
He's been coming by
all week,

03:58.472 --> 04:00.739
Dropping things off,
making excuses.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.475
I did wonder when he brought
max's pyjamas last Friday.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.144
I mean, he's cute

04:06.146 --> 04:08.079
But I think someone like
fergus is more my type.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.481
He's everyone's type.

04:09.550 --> 04:13.418
We've all bagged a fergus,
a cliff. Gregor. Rook.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.819
Are you still
saying names?

04:14.855 --> 04:16.421
Jeffrey is handsome,
single,

04:16.423 --> 04:19.424
And in that great post-futon,
pre-bifocal sweet spot.

04:21.962 --> 04:22.995
Sorry.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.830
Forgot my keys
like a dumb-dumb.

04:24.965 --> 04:25.831
I mean, I'm not.

04:25.833 --> 04:26.898
I have a phd
in physics

04:26.967 --> 04:28.300
But sometimes
you'd never know it.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.768
Right.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.103
Okay.
I didn't forget.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.837
I'd like to ask you
to go for coffee.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.639
There's a great place
around the corner

04:34.675 --> 04:36.407
That makes great mochaccinos
that are really--

04:36.443 --> 04:37.775
Great?
See?

04:37.811 --> 04:38.810
We're on
the same wavelength.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.245
Okay,
lemme get my coat.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.379
Great.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.515
And I said that one
intentionally.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.150
(chuckling)

04:47.821 --> 04:49.521
(dog grumbling)
sorry.

04:49.656 --> 04:50.655
(clearing throat)

04:50.658 --> 04:52.257
(laughing)

04:52.392 --> 04:53.859
Hey,
I'm gonna go on break.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.795
Okay, and should paco
just finish brushing himself,

04:56.864 --> 04:57.796
Or--

04:57.798 --> 04:59.464
Yeah. Reach for
the stars, paco.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.665
You need to finish
what you start.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.866
I'm going to.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.136
I got an emergency text
from my mom.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.436
I heard you laughing.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.004
Yeah, she fell.
It's funny.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.907
Oh my god, nikki.
I am trying so hard with you.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.575
What is this,
a fisherman's hitch?

05:10.577 --> 05:11.910
Stop micromanaging.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.246
(sighing) look, as your role
model and mentor--

05:14.248 --> 05:15.280
Okay, goin' on break.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.815
No. I'm sorry, no.
No break.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.750
Not until
paco is brushed,

05:18.786 --> 05:20.918
The leashes are unknotted,
and the freezer is clean.

05:20.954 --> 05:24.823
I have made a list to both
inspire and to inform.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.992
But also to do.
This is why they pay us.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.860
Do you think that I enjoy
returning dead bunnies

05:28.995 --> 05:30.061
To their owners?

05:30.097 --> 05:31.229
Okay, fine.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.831
But right now I need
to vape and pluck a brow

05:32.900 --> 05:35.500
And then I'll get to your
cruel and unusual list.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.701
Don't walk away
from me.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.303
That's number four
on the list!

05:38.372 --> 05:40.572
Paco, sit.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.775
Yes!
Still got it.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.543
It's only
been two months,

05:45.545 --> 05:47.045
But I still haven't
burned the place down.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.580
Well, it's important
to have goals.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.982
Yeah,
I needed a change.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.851
Just hope it was
the right change.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.719
You're obviously
not from here.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.721
I have family here
but I'm from nova scotia.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.856
No way!
I lived in antigonish.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.725
Ah!
What's yer fadder's name?

06:00.794 --> 06:01.693
Jeffrey.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.395
He was a prof
at saint f.X.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.663
Oh. So you're only
kind of a caper.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.865
Dj'ever get puck'd
in the t'roat?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.367
Ah, no.
(chuckling)

06:08.502 --> 06:09.667
I played lacrosse.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.002
So, I pucked dem
in the throat.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.737
(chuckling)
okay.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.206
Ah, we should
have dinner some time.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.440
Oh, wow.
I mean, uh--

06:15.442 --> 06:17.275
Don't worry. I'll--
I'll pay my half.

06:17.277 --> 06:18.810
No, no, no, no.
I'm just--

06:18.945 --> 06:20.745
I'm just thinking
about max

06:20.748 --> 06:22.814
And me being
his co-op supervisor.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.015
So, um--

06:24.017 --> 06:25.751
You know what, maybe
we can play this by ear?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.085
Of course.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.088
But, uh, it'll be
a spectacular dinner.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.956
Hell of a scoff, wha'?

06:32.025 --> 06:33.692
Sure, I won a side o' beef
at meat darts.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.628
Well,
it's very tempting.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.930
'cause I dies
at a good steak, wha'?

06:42.703 --> 06:43.935
It went well.

06:47.641 --> 06:48.673
Jenga!

06:48.675 --> 06:51.042
Yeah-- f-for sure.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.177
Sorry?

06:52.246 --> 06:53.245
Nothing.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.312
Your dad
brought this by.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.814
Thank you.
(clearing throat)

06:55.816 --> 06:57.849
Hey, so, your dad--

06:57.885 --> 06:59.250
Oh, you think
he's handsome.

06:59.319 --> 07:00.652
What?
Yeah.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.721
All the moms at my school,
they're all over him,

07:02.856 --> 07:04.322
Especially
kira hassan's mom.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.590
She touches his arms
a lot and--

07:05.725 --> 07:06.791
No, no!

07:06.794 --> 07:08.260
I was just gonna say
he's nice.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.061
Which totally makes sense
because you're nice

07:10.063 --> 07:13.331
And easy to talk to,
like your dad.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.067
Kira hassan said that nice guys
don't make good boyfriends,

07:16.069 --> 07:17.869
Because there isn't
enough drama.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.005
(scoffing)
well, that's kira's loss.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.140
She would be lucky to date
someone as nice as you,

07:22.275 --> 07:23.474
Or your dad.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.743
Sure,
games can be fun,

07:24.878 --> 07:26.478
But could be refreshing
to date a guy

07:26.613 --> 07:28.547
That texts back
in 24 hours.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.949
Oh.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.952
But, if it makes you
uncomfortable in any way--

07:34.021 --> 07:37.021
Well, there's, you know,
bit of an age difference.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.824
Well, it's really
not that much.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.331
We didn't mean
to let him escape.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.067
Of course you didn't.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.534
There it is again.

16:10.570 --> 16:11.836
Let me go get socks.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.404
Dad:
Thank you.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.477
Oh! Jeff...Rey.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.278
Hi.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.679
Sorry, I--
I tried calling.

16:22.716 --> 16:25.216
Oh.
Just a busy morning.

16:25.218 --> 16:28.285
Look, I am so sorry
about the tuck.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.854
No! No, no, no, no.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.289
No. It was just a little bit
tighter than I'm used to.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.824
You know, new town,
new job.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.960
Might be too soon for
a new bedspread to boot.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.229
You know,
I think I just need

16:38.298 --> 16:40.298
To take some shannon time,
you know?

16:40.433 --> 16:42.233
Tuck myself in
for a while.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.768
Definitely.
I get that.

16:43.770 --> 16:47.038
And I support that,
not that you need my support.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.440
Anyway, uh,
this is for you.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.512
And I'll make sure
that max

16:54.581 --> 16:57.181
Doesn't forget
anything else at home.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.401
(dogs barking
in background)

17:19.472 --> 17:20.204
Oh, no.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.739
There he is,
up and at 'er.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.608
Did you see the freezer?
You could lick it.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.210
But don't. It's broken.
Got a little shock when I tried.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.213
That's not the freezer
I wanted you to clean.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.517
Did you throw out socks?
No. I threw out a shoe.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.552
And I think it might be joy's,
so, like, don't say anything.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.421
No, socks.
The rabbit!

17:36.556 --> 17:38.822
Oh, yeah. Don't worry.
He's chillin'.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.023
Ohh! Thank god.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.359
(exhaling)
where?

17:43.763 --> 17:45.162
Oh. Ah!

17:46.032 --> 17:47.165
Nikki!

17:54.808 --> 17:55.840
Hi.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.474
I'm so sorry
for the delay.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.176
We were just
preparing everything.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.511
What's there
to prepare?

18:00.580 --> 18:01.979
I mean, it's--
it's a rabbit.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.714
It should just
be a second.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.551
(groaning)

18:16.563 --> 18:17.561
Huh?

18:17.630 --> 18:18.562
(water dripping)

18:19.665 --> 18:20.665
Got your text.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.667
Though your phone
autocorrected it

18:22.802 --> 18:24.768
To you getting "tucked".
Hilarious.

18:24.838 --> 18:25.870
It's not hilarious.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.005
He literally tucked me in.
I couldn't move.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.039
Adorable.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.241
Jeffrey's a nice guy

18:30.243 --> 18:31.742
But I'm putting this
on pause.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.477
But the roof.
The upgrades!

18:33.480 --> 18:36.881
Uh, I'm sorry, but my love life
is not about money.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.549
He did give me
this card.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.684
Sweet.

18:39.686 --> 18:40.817
(sighing)

18:40.854 --> 18:42.353
And a cheque.
Yes!

18:42.422 --> 18:45.189
I mean, how much?
I mean, that's great,

18:45.225 --> 18:46.624
But seriously,
how much?

18:47.694 --> 18:49.193
It's blank.

18:49.328 --> 18:50.561
How much
should we put down?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.430
I don't know.
I'm-- I'm not comfortable

18:53.500 --> 18:56.233
Knowing my relationship
with jeffrey is behind this.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.434
Is $500,000 too much?

18:57.504 --> 18:58.903
Liam.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.571
I'm just gonna write down
a series of numbers

19:00.573 --> 19:01.839
And you just point
to the one

19:01.974 --> 19:03.974
That you think
is the most reasonable.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.777
(sighing) okay. Obviously I
would love a big donation,

19:06.846 --> 19:07.979
But not like this.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.213
Gah!

19:12.719 --> 19:13.784
(sighing)

19:13.786 --> 19:16.654
Well,
now we're all "tucked".

19:16.656 --> 19:20.324
Kristian:
Okay. Here we go!

19:20.326 --> 19:21.458
Nikki,
you have the corpse?

19:21.494 --> 19:22.660
The remains.
The dead rabbit.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.163
This isn't
coming out well.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.798
Sorry about
your bunny.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.801
But we made sure he's cuddling
with his favourite toy.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.737
You wanna see him
and say goodbye?

19:35.608 --> 19:36.907
Here.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.076
Kristian:
Aw.

19:39.112 --> 19:40.477
This is so lovely!

19:40.513 --> 19:42.346
But don't pet the eyelids.
They might pop open.

19:42.481 --> 19:44.414
You know,
when our dog lyric died,

19:44.450 --> 19:46.750
We released these
floating lanterns.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.452
Oh, maybe we could do that.
Hey, honey?

19:48.488 --> 19:50.888
When my aunt died we buried her
with a list of places

19:50.957 --> 19:53.290
That she always wanted
to visit but never did

19:53.326 --> 19:55.092
Because she was
agoraphobic.

19:55.227 --> 19:56.360
Nikki:
Jesus.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.195
Well, thanks again.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.764
Okay, this is--
this is very special,

19:59.766 --> 20:02.266
And kinda weird.

20:02.268 --> 20:03.768
Yeah.
Let's just go.

20:03.903 --> 20:04.769
Okay.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.304
See ya, kiddo!

20:06.306 --> 20:07.371
Thanks.

20:07.506 --> 20:08.906
Thank you.

20:12.779 --> 20:13.777
(sighing)

20:13.813 --> 20:15.179
You're clearly
very good at this.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.380
Thanks.

20:16.515 --> 20:18.149
And just so you know,
paco's brushed, fed,

20:18.284 --> 20:19.984
And got his ear medication.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.252
You mean
eye medication.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.987
Sure.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.455
Thank you.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.924
You're a mostly very helpful
part of this team.

20:26.993 --> 20:30.260
Paul:
Who put the dead hamster
in the microwave?

20:30.296 --> 20:31.928
I thought it was
a corndog!

20:38.605 --> 20:40.238
Hey, shannon,

20:40.373 --> 20:43.274
A woman's asking if she can take
a puppy for a test drive.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.342
Is that a thing?

20:44.477 --> 20:45.509
Yeah, sure. No problem.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.077
Really? Wow.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.346
I thought it sounded like a
really good way to lose a puppy,

20:49.415 --> 20:51.816
But I'll let her know.

20:51.951 --> 20:52.817
Are you okay?

20:52.952 --> 20:54.385
You haven't seen any
bits of paper

20:54.520 --> 20:55.753
Floating around,
have you?

20:55.755 --> 20:57.989
Is that
jeffrey's cheque?

20:58.124 --> 21:00.224
Oh, liam said
you ripped it up.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.360
Well, he didn't so much say it
as sob it into his jacket.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.561
Sometimes decisions
feel right in the moment

21:04.563 --> 21:05.963
And then you realize
you have a leaky roof

21:05.965 --> 21:07.631
And a hole in your wall
and a broken pet freezer

21:07.700 --> 21:09.299
So maybe, as your
high school bully put it,

21:09.335 --> 21:11.302
"it's time to put the 'me'
above the 'we'" and--

21:11.304 --> 21:12.970
(gasping)
oh my god.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.039
Ah, jackpot! Okay.

21:15.174 --> 21:17.708
I don't think the bank
will accept that.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.610
Joy, I'm a woman
on the verge.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.477
I'll get the tape.

21:20.513 --> 21:21.812
