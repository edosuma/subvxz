00:00.709 --> 00:03.511
My name is Roman. Ten years ago, our ship

00:03.519 --> 00:05.300
crash-landed on Earth.

00:05.302 --> 00:07.469
We came here seeking refuge,
but the humans thought

00:07.471 --> 00:08.904
that it was an invasion.

00:10.841 --> 00:14.538
That night, I met a human
girl who tried to protect me.

00:14.547 --> 00:16.640
A girl I never thought I'd see again.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.859
The surviving members of my race,

00:18.859 --> 00:20.353
the Atrians, were rounded up

00:20.361 --> 00:22.856
and isolated inside a militarized sector.

00:22.864 --> 00:24.219
Now it's 2024.

00:24.221 --> 00:26.797
Seven of us have been
chosen to attend high school

00:26.805 --> 00:28.957
as a part of a government
integration program.

00:28.966 --> 00:30.704
But the humans and Atrians

00:30.712 --> 00:32.665
continue to distrust each other,

00:32.665 --> 00:34.344
while I fight to protect my people

00:34.344 --> 00:36.420
and the human girl who saved my life

00:36.420 --> 00:38.108
at any cost.

00:39.121 --> 00:41.323
Previously on Star-Crossed:

00:42.638 --> 00:44.915
I found this in Julia's hospital room.

00:44.924 --> 00:46.822
- You saved her life.
- It didn't happen.

00:48.012 --> 00:49.555
Killing the daughter of the man

00:49.555 --> 00:50.966
who murdered Nox will send a message

00:50.966 --> 00:52.265
that we're serious.

00:52.274 --> 00:53.983
You stay away from Emery.

00:53.992 --> 00:55.683
I should say the same thing to you.

00:55.685 --> 00:57.418
This is bigger than the two of us now.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.468
Maybe it's safer if we're apart.

00:59.477 --> 01:00.270
My parents are

01:00.270 --> 01:01.882
who they are, okay,
but I am not a Red Hawk.

01:01.890 --> 01:02.734
I don't believe you.

01:02.743 --> 01:04.592
- Let me explain!
- Don't touch me!

01:10.500 --> 01:12.200
Hey, what are you doing?

01:13.135 --> 01:15.002
No!

01:17.178 --> 01:19.692
Who are they? What are they doing here?

01:20.342 --> 01:22.933
- English!
- I was just telling my son

01:22.941 --> 01:23.819
that someone reported

01:23.819 --> 01:24.946
we had restricted technology.

01:27.256 --> 01:30.049
We don't have restricted
tech, so you can just stop!

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.362 --> 01:43.030
They can threaten us all they want.

01:43.032 --> 01:44.465
We have nothing to hide.

01:50.038 --> 01:52.706
Actually, we do.

02:01.916 --> 02:03.793
We're not allowed to have phones.

02:05.220 --> 02:08.663
The only people with access to
tech like that are the Trags.

02:09.321 --> 02:11.540
I found it hidden in your father's things

02:11.542 --> 02:12.715
a few weeks ago.

02:12.723 --> 02:14.909
And you waited till just now to tell us?

02:14.917 --> 02:16.816
I... I didn't want you
to know he-he had it.

02:16.816 --> 02:18.183
I didn't want you to think that...

02:18.183 --> 02:19.233
What?

02:19.235 --> 02:20.801
To think that he was a terrorist?

02:22.537 --> 02:24.805
How could we ever think that?

02:25.773 --> 02:27.040
I've tried to access the phone,

02:27.042 --> 02:29.076
but I can't make it work.

02:32.516 --> 02:33.850
Whoever filed that report

02:33.850 --> 02:34.955
knows that we have this.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.183
If the guards find out...

02:36.185 --> 02:37.765
They'll paint your father as a Trag.

02:37.765 --> 02:40.061
We'll never be let out of the sector again.

02:42.490 --> 02:44.157
We have to destroy it.

02:45.993 --> 02:47.527
I'll get rid of it.

02:49.330 --> 02:52.499
Outside the sector.

02:54.024 --> 02:59.024

- Addic7ed.com -

03:05.080 --> 03:07.080
Relax.

03:08.090 --> 03:09.423
As a Trag, you'll have

03:09.423 --> 03:10.951
a front-row seat to their annihilation.

03:10.951 --> 03:13.006
Yeah, I've already seen
a Trag get annihilated.

03:13.006 --> 03:14.373
Can't say I liked it much.

03:14.373 --> 03:15.779
What, you mean Beaumont? He was a spy.

03:15.779 --> 03:16.689
My mother had no choice.

03:16.691 --> 03:18.525
Look, all I'm saying is I joined the Trags

03:18.527 --> 03:21.057
because I want freedom
for our people, all right?

03:21.057 --> 03:23.082
We need to tear down
the walls of the sector.

03:23.082 --> 03:24.424
So you can find Eljida?

03:24.424 --> 03:26.399
That fairy-tale swampland
you keep yapping about?

03:26.401 --> 03:29.116
Right now, we're the Trags' best link

03:29.116 --> 03:31.566
to the outside world, so fall in line.

03:31.572 --> 03:32.939
You remember what happens

03:32.939 --> 03:34.007
to Trags who disappoint my mother.

03:39.313 --> 03:41.481
How are you planning on
getting rid of the phone?

03:41.483 --> 03:43.082
Don't worry about it.

03:43.084 --> 03:44.917
You're not gonna destroy it, are you?

03:45.984 --> 03:48.010
The Trags hated everything dad stood for.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.706
There's no way he was one of them.

03:49.706 --> 03:51.988
I have to find out what was on that phone.

03:58.065 --> 03:59.899
Hey.

03:59.901 --> 04:02.719
How are, uh, you doing?

04:02.719 --> 04:05.192
Happy to be back to my usual shade of pale.

04:05.192 --> 04:06.506
Thank you very much.

04:06.508 --> 04:08.808
You know I'm eternally in your debt

04:08.808 --> 04:10.610
for saving my life, essentially twice.

04:10.612 --> 04:12.578
Right?

04:12.580 --> 04:15.448
Okay, so you've kept the secret of cyper.

04:15.448 --> 04:17.450
Can I count on you to keep another one?

04:17.452 --> 04:20.252
Eternal... debt.

04:20.254 --> 04:22.955
All right, then.

04:24.624 --> 04:27.823
Isn't it illegal for
Atrians to have phones?

04:27.823 --> 04:29.795
Yes, but it's important that I find out

04:29.797 --> 04:31.130
what's on this one.

04:31.132 --> 04:33.291
Machines aren't my thing.

04:33.291 --> 04:36.202
But I think I know someone who can help.

04:36.202 --> 04:37.417
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:37.417 --> 04:38.704
Okay, uh...

04:42.175 --> 04:43.542
We'll talk.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.211
Mm-hmm.

04:46.913 --> 04:50.282
It's nice to know Roman
isn't freezing all humans out.

04:50.282 --> 04:52.582
Yeah, I was just congratulating him

04:52.582 --> 04:54.620
on his speech at the commemoration event.

04:55.922 --> 04:58.824
We should get to class.

05:00.161 --> 05:02.488
Atrians have two hearts

05:02.488 --> 05:04.338
and two full sets of lungs.

05:04.338 --> 05:07.822
Now, this, combined with their
skin's ability to absorb oxygen

05:07.822 --> 05:10.536
from air and water, it makes
their respiratory system...

05:10.538 --> 05:13.307
- Superior.
- Like everything else about us.

05:13.307 --> 05:15.256
No, Teri, not superior.

05:15.256 --> 05:16.235
Different.

05:16.235 --> 05:18.181
The important thing to remember is

05:18.181 --> 05:20.595
that Atrians' biological
differences are due

05:20.595 --> 05:22.114
to their native environment, right down

05:22.116 --> 05:25.135
to their markings, which
are bioluminescent in water.

05:25.135 --> 05:25.954
Why's that?

05:25.954 --> 05:26.882
Sophia?

05:26.882 --> 05:27.926
To light our way.

05:27.926 --> 05:28.685
Exactly.

05:28.685 --> 05:31.435
It's called adaptive
evolution, and, I mean,

05:31.436 --> 05:32.491
those aren't the only differences.

05:32.493 --> 05:36.027
Um, physically, Atrians
mature faster than we do.

05:36.029 --> 05:38.296
They're sensitive to things like salt

05:38.298 --> 05:40.966
and dry air, and they're
allergic to a lot of our foods.

05:40.968 --> 05:42.367
Like cilantro

05:42.369 --> 05:44.269
and pretty much anything
with caffeine in it.

05:44.271 --> 05:47.539
But in a lot of ways, Atrians and humans

05:47.541 --> 05:49.241
are strikingly similar.

05:49.243 --> 05:52.277
Yeah, some biologists even
suggest a common origin.

05:52.279 --> 05:54.613
Yes, Zoe?

05:54.615 --> 05:56.615
So, does that mean an Atrian and a human

05:56.617 --> 05:58.116
could get their intergalactic freak on?

05:58.118 --> 06:00.819
Hypothetically, yes.

06:00.821 --> 06:01.853
And how's their endurance?

06:01.855 --> 06:03.855
Are we talking marathon man

06:03.857 --> 06:05.523
or sprint and face plant?

06:05.525 --> 06:08.259
Blondie, you couldn't handle my endurance.

06:08.261 --> 06:10.061
Better use protection.

06:10.063 --> 06:11.763
Alien crabs don't just itch.

06:11.765 --> 06:12.864
They bite.

06:12.866 --> 06:14.032
Oh!

06:14.034 --> 06:15.133
I missed you, too, sweetheart.

06:15.135 --> 06:17.101
Guys. Guys? Drake?

06:17.103 --> 06:18.469
I think that's enough.

06:18.471 --> 06:20.505
If this class is too challenging for you,

06:20.507 --> 06:23.174
we can go back to flatworms. Flatworms?

06:24.176 --> 06:27.078
Okay. Everybody scroll down to page 17.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.347
Flatworms.

06:42.061 --> 06:45.763
Ooh, new girl already scoring blossoms.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.866
Who are they from?

06:48.868 --> 06:50.902
No card. Hmm.

06:50.904 --> 06:52.603
Stargazer lilies.

06:52.605 --> 06:54.205
Could be a clue.

06:54.207 --> 06:56.674
Do you happen to know anyone
from the stars, perhaps?

06:56.676 --> 06:57.742
Hey, Lukas.

06:57.744 --> 06:59.696
You got a second?

06:59.696 --> 07:01.975
For you, fair lady? Thousands.

07:03.315 --> 07:05.283
Do you like them?

07:06.852 --> 07:08.352
These are from you?

07:08.354 --> 07:10.699
Florist said they're called stargazers

07:10.699 --> 07:12.623
because their bloom faces the sky.

07:14.526 --> 07:16.761
I wanted to apologize for what happened

07:16.763 --> 07:18.429
at the commemoration event with my parents.

07:18.431 --> 07:20.931
You can't change who your parents are.

07:20.933 --> 07:23.134
But you should've been honest with me.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.637
I was afraid, if you knew the truth,

07:26.639 --> 07:28.239
it might scare you off.

07:29.508 --> 07:31.976
I am scared of who your parents are.

07:31.978 --> 07:34.411
But I'm a big girl.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.313
I can handle the truth.

07:36.315 --> 07:38.616
I can see that now.

07:38.618 --> 07:41.018
Look, I promise...

07:41.020 --> 07:44.088
I'll never lie to you again.

07:48.226 --> 07:51.095
I want to believe you... I do... but...

07:51.097 --> 07:53.664
I just can't right now.

07:58.169 --> 08:00.536
Are you sure about this?

08:00.536 --> 08:03.237
Lukas is a genius with all things tech.

08:03.237 --> 08:05.609
Yeah, but I barely trust
you. How can I trust him?

08:05.611 --> 08:08.245
Whoa, you know I'm on
the Atrians' side, ride?

08:08.247 --> 08:10.686
You, me, Julia.

08:10.686 --> 08:12.816
Us minorities got to
stick together, you know?

08:12.818 --> 08:14.885
You're minorities?

08:14.887 --> 08:16.853
We were until the Atrians arrived.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.157
All right.

08:22.193 --> 08:24.528
I need whatever data you
can retrieve off this.

08:24.530 --> 08:27.097
- Hybrid technology?
- Cool, huh?

08:27.099 --> 08:28.965
Yeah, these phones are
cobbled together with whatever

08:28.967 --> 08:31.334
we Atrians can find or smuggle

08:31.336 --> 08:32.903
into the sector.

08:32.905 --> 08:35.238
Power source and casing
are Atrian, but it's got

08:35.240 --> 08:36.673
a human SIM card and main memory.

08:36.674 --> 08:38.875
I can work with that.

08:41.078 --> 08:42.379
Whoa.

08:42.381 --> 08:43.947
This baby's been wiped.

08:43.948 --> 08:46.030
Some kind of auto-erase, set to trigger

08:46.030 --> 08:47.718
if the phone's been left idle too long.

08:47.718 --> 08:49.467
See, I'm guessing that whoever owned it

08:49.467 --> 08:51.554
didn't want anyone to
know what they were up to.

08:52.590 --> 08:54.090
- So the data's gone?
- Oh.

08:54.092 --> 08:55.625
That's the wonderful thing about data.

08:55.627 --> 08:58.294
It's never truly gone. So step back...

08:58.296 --> 08:59.863
And watch the magic.

09:12.643 --> 09:14.767
That's our swim team.

09:17.081 --> 09:19.526
I've never been a part
of something like that.

09:20.517 --> 09:22.446
A team.

09:24.088 --> 09:28.691
Even in the sector, I don't
really have many friends.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.044
I was hoping to find some on the outside,

09:31.044 --> 09:35.465
but... it's not that easy, is it?

09:35.467 --> 09:36.866
Friendships are tough.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.367
Even for humans.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.827
Swimming is important here?

09:46.777 --> 09:49.225
If our team beats Collier prep tomorrow,

09:49.225 --> 09:50.845
then they go to state finals.

09:50.845 --> 09:54.482
The first time our dad took
us to the lagoon by our house

09:54.482 --> 09:56.786
on Atria, Roman just dove right in.

09:56.788 --> 09:59.989
He's always been fearless that way.

09:59.991 --> 10:03.492
But I needed a little nudge.

10:03.494 --> 10:05.795
So my dad taught me to swim.

10:05.797 --> 10:08.230
It's...

10:08.232 --> 10:10.906
One of the earliest memories I have.

10:10.906 --> 10:13.421
The two of us in that lagoon.

10:13.421 --> 10:16.505
It seems like you guys
are incredible swimmers,

10:16.507 --> 10:18.440
based on everything Ms. Benton was saying.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.877
But there's nowhere to swim in the sector.

10:21.879 --> 10:25.001
I haven't been in the
water since we got here.

10:29.219 --> 10:31.220
Hey.

10:31.222 --> 10:34.123
You need to see this.

10:54.844 --> 10:56.345
What's Eric's record, again?

10:56.347 --> 10:58.480
4:19.

11:03.519 --> 11:04.920
Four minutes and 17 seconds!

11:05.889 --> 11:07.155
She broke form.

11:07.157 --> 11:09.291
Is that what we call freestyle?

11:11.028 --> 11:13.462
Then why don't you race her?

11:13.464 --> 11:15.434
Head to head.

11:16.132 --> 11:17.566
Because I'm not getting in the pool

11:17.568 --> 11:19.101
with a disease-ridden tattie.

11:19.103 --> 11:21.470
That's why.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm just concerned for my daughter

11:32.026 --> 11:33.326
Have the Atrians even been tested

11:33.328 --> 11:35.362
- for any diseases?
- Yes, of course

11:35.364 --> 11:36.930
- they have.
- Mom, you should've seen her.

11:36.932 --> 11:39.366
She broke Eric's state record!

11:39.368 --> 11:40.534
Like hell she did.

11:40.536 --> 11:42.836
Hey, I've got an idea.

11:42.838 --> 11:44.871
Why don't we let a dolphin on the team?

11:44.873 --> 11:46.573
Or an alligator. They're
really fast swimmers, too.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.008
Come on, lots of athletes

11:48.010 --> 11:50.043
have physical advantages. Michael Phelps...

11:50.045 --> 11:51.811
He had double-jointed
ankles. Are you saying

11:51.813 --> 11:53.113
you wouldn't want that on our team?

11:53.115 --> 11:55.315
Okay. Enough. Sophia...

11:55.317 --> 11:57.317
- I encouraged her. It's my f...
- No.

11:57.319 --> 11:58.885
I wanted to do it.

11:58.887 --> 12:00.420
I want to be on the team.

12:00.422 --> 12:01.721
And I'm afraid that's not possible.

12:01.723 --> 12:02.989
When your father and I

12:02.991 --> 12:04.391
negotiated the integration program,

12:04.393 --> 12:05.955
we both agreed that sports,

12:05.964 --> 12:07.994
at least at the start,
might pose a security risk.

12:07.996 --> 12:09.729
The meet is on school grounds.

12:09.731 --> 12:11.798
You're saying you can't
protect them at Marshall?

12:11.800 --> 12:15.001
Even if we did bring in
additional security, okay,

12:15.003 --> 12:17.804
the board decided having
Atrians participate in sports

12:17.806 --> 12:19.572
would be disruptive to the other students.

12:19.574 --> 12:21.207
They've been training for years...

12:21.209 --> 12:22.609
So you're leaving your
best swimmer off the team?

12:22.611 --> 12:24.230
Right before a meet with Collier prep?

12:24.230 --> 12:25.745
If she took you guys to state,

12:25.747 --> 12:26.854
would that be disruptive?

12:26.854 --> 12:28.748
Stop encouraging her.

12:28.750 --> 12:31.344
I don't think this is a good idea.

12:31.344 --> 12:34.354
Well, I think it's a great idea.

12:34.356 --> 12:36.889
I mean, you want to talk
about unfair advantages?

12:36.891 --> 12:39.358
Collier makes state every year

12:39.360 --> 12:40.927
because they're a private school

12:40.929 --> 12:43.596
and can pull in the best
athletes from the Gulf coast.

12:43.598 --> 12:45.898
I mean, they're... They're a factory.

12:45.900 --> 12:48.167
I say this year, we fight back.

12:48.169 --> 12:49.302
See?

12:49.304 --> 12:50.436
What's the problem?

12:51.271 --> 12:54.140
I will talk to the board.

12:54.142 --> 12:56.642
Okay? If I can reverse their
decision, I'm counting on

12:56.644 --> 12:59.645
all of you to be on your best behavior.

12:59.647 --> 13:02.281
Am I making myself clear?

13:14.763 --> 13:16.636
You need to think about this.

13:16.636 --> 13:19.265
You're making yourself a
target for the Red Hawks.

13:19.267 --> 13:20.800
Or any nutjob with a gun.

13:20.802 --> 13:22.679
- We're already targets.
- I'm just saying

13:22.687 --> 13:25.771
we should avoid taking
any unnecessary risks.

13:25.773 --> 13:27.006
Risks?

13:27.008 --> 13:28.707
Like keeping dad's phone?

13:28.709 --> 13:30.476
That's different.

13:30.478 --> 13:33.279
This is what dad wanted for us, Roman.

13:33.281 --> 13:35.724
To be with the humans, part of their world.

13:35.724 --> 13:37.416
I know you want to figure out

13:37.418 --> 13:39.318
what dad was up to.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.653
But this is how I am choosing to honor him.

13:49.028 --> 13:50.629
Hey!

13:50.631 --> 13:51.997
That was cool, what you did,

13:51.999 --> 13:53.499
backing Sophia.

13:53.501 --> 13:54.766
If you're a secret Red Hawk,

13:54.768 --> 13:57.169
you're a pretty terrible one.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.538
Look, you don't have to accept my parents

13:59.540 --> 14:01.073
or trust them.

14:01.075 --> 14:03.308
I'm not asking you to do that.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.410
But you can trust me.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.446
I'm not my parents.

14:07.448 --> 14:09.147
I'm not... a Red Hawk.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.316
I'm beginning to realize that.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.318
I just wanted you to think I was normal,

14:13.320 --> 14:14.753
at least for a little while.

14:14.755 --> 14:16.054
Hey. I spent

14:16.056 --> 14:17.756
half my life in and out of hospitals,

14:17.758 --> 14:19.624
dealing with allergies and injections.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.260
I know what it's like
to want to feel normal.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.099
In that case, I have
three words for you, then.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.936
Carb. Load. Dinner.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.194
It's a tradition.

14:32.194 --> 14:34.539
The night before a meet,
the swim team goes to the bug

14:34.541 --> 14:36.508
to load up on pasta.

14:36.510 --> 14:39.077
And you should come.

14:42.304 --> 14:45.884
I've never been one to pass up a free meal.

14:49.288 --> 14:50.522
So I've been able

14:50.524 --> 14:52.090
to recover a big chunk of data.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.858
But it looks like the only
thing this phone ever did

14:53.860 --> 14:55.693
was text back and forth
with one other phone.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.662
Just one? Yep.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.931
And all the texts have
just been times and dates.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.866
Every few days, up until a few weeks back.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.002
My guess

15:04.004 --> 15:06.137
is someone was setting up meetings.

15:06.139 --> 15:09.140
Clandestine-style.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.842
And that's it?

15:10.844 --> 15:13.611
Well, I did find a video file
attached to an incoming text.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.959
I mean, it was all encrypted, but...

15:15.959 --> 15:17.570
I probably can get it to play.

15:17.570 --> 15:20.084
It's just gonna take some time.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.849
You keep it overnight.

15:22.849 --> 15:24.956
It's safer with you than in the sector.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.434
Mom?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.935
What happened?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.937
SEU guards were just here
with electronic scanners.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.706
They were angry that they didn't

15:41.708 --> 15:43.841
find anything. They know
about your father's phone.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.910
I... I don't know how, but they know.

15:47.913 --> 15:50.114
It's okay, Roman.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.516
We can trust your uncle Castor.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.619
I told him I gave you the phone to destroy.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.320
Do you still have it?

15:57.456 --> 15:59.156
It's gone.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.791
I took care of it.

16:05.397 --> 16:07.198
Do you have any idea why my father

16:07.200 --> 16:08.499
would have had that phone?

16:08.501 --> 16:10.349
No.

16:10.349 --> 16:12.236
But the Trags were using the...

16:12.238 --> 16:13.938
My father wasn't a Trag.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.973
I know that, Roman.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.842
But it doesn't take away the fact

16:17.844 --> 16:19.810
that he was hiding it for a reason.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.146
Are you certain

16:22.148 --> 16:23.847
no one could connect the phone to you?

16:23.849 --> 16:26.016
Or this family?

16:28.184 --> 16:30.707
Like I said, it's gone.

16:34.292 --> 16:36.737
This is Matt Bandell,

16:36.737 --> 16:38.146
reporting from Edendale,

16:38.146 --> 16:40.593
a town buzzing from the news that Sophia,

16:40.599 --> 16:43.200
daughter of slain Atrian leader Nox,

16:43.202 --> 16:44.649
will swim for Marshall high

16:44.649 --> 16:46.978
I can't believe the board
is gonna let her swim.

16:46.978 --> 16:49.773
You know that Tulane scholarship
you've been angling for?

16:49.775 --> 16:52.009
All this coverage could
put you over the top.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.244
You really think anyone's
gonna want to watch a human swim

16:54.246 --> 16:56.046
when there's mer-martians in the pool?

16:59.346 --> 17:01.852
Incoming.

17:04.856 --> 17:05.936
Hey.

17:05.936 --> 17:07.017
Hey.

17:07.017 --> 17:09.259
I heard there'd be pasta.

17:09.261 --> 17:11.395
All you can eat.

17:11.396 --> 17:14.164
You know, I read that the
whole carb-loading thing

17:14.165 --> 17:15.766
is actually just a myth.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.934
You think it's just an excuse

17:17.935 --> 17:21.238
for me to gorge myself
with fettuccine Alfredo?

17:21.240 --> 17:23.640
Mmm, maybe.

17:23.642 --> 17:25.642
Well, have you heard
the myth about the girl

17:25.644 --> 17:27.143
who took a guy up on a date

17:27.145 --> 17:28.845
even after he did something stupid?

17:28.847 --> 17:31.581
No. I haven't heard that one.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.484
Well, I guess some myths have some truth.

17:34.486 --> 17:37.253
A date? That's what this is?

17:37.255 --> 17:39.055
That so bad?

17:39.890 --> 17:42.325
No.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.227
Not at all.

17:57.675 --> 18:00.276
Smile for the camera.

18:12.910 --> 18:14.223
Oh!

18:14.225 --> 18:16.919
Got a tip you might be
carrying some illegal tech.

18:16.919 --> 18:18.928
What? What? From who?

18:18.930 --> 18:20.708
Assume the position.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.299
What are you doing?! You
should be protecting her!

18:28.705 --> 18:30.640
He's clean.

18:30.642 --> 18:31.974
Let go!

18:32.917 --> 18:34.844
Move! Move!

18:55.694 --> 18:59.261
I don't suppose any of you
have heard of Jackie Robinson.

19:02.083 --> 19:05.590
Well, he was one of the greatest
athletes in American history.

19:05.590 --> 19:07.819
But because of the color
of his skin, it took

19:07.819 --> 19:10.815
some time before he was
allowed to play in the majors.

19:10.815 --> 19:13.499
I take it he was also
met with a warm welcoming?

19:13.499 --> 19:17.239
He was called names, spit
on, even physically attacked.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.619
But the important thing is...

19:19.619 --> 19:21.593
He never rose to the bait.

19:21.593 --> 19:24.170
So you're saying suck it up?

19:24.800 --> 19:27.399
Throughout American history,
sports have been a crucial path

19:27.399 --> 19:29.515
to acceptance for minorities.

19:29.515 --> 19:31.051
But it's not enough to be good

19:31.051 --> 19:32.671
at what you do.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.595
Or even great.

19:35.816 --> 19:38.803
I need all seven of you to be

19:38.803 --> 19:40.331
exemplary.

19:40.331 --> 19:41.833
Model citizens.

19:41.833 --> 19:44.624
That means behaving in a
way that is beyond reproach

19:44.626 --> 19:47.160
and never resorting to violence.

19:47.162 --> 19:49.329
You, young lady,

19:49.331 --> 19:51.543
need to learn to use your words.

19:51.543 --> 19:53.956
You want words? How about...

19:53.956 --> 19:55.720
- "Screw this"?
- Teri...

19:55.720 --> 19:57.264
Why should we put up with this?

19:57.264 --> 19:58.707
Being paraded around in front of the masses

19:58.707 --> 20:00.806
like freaks... for you?

20:00.806 --> 20:02.569
No.

20:03.734 --> 20:05.354
For me.

20:05.675 --> 20:08.414
And not just me.

20:08.416 --> 20:11.284
For my dad.

20:13.921 --> 20:17.523
Please... Can I count on you guys?

20:18.145 --> 20:20.161
Give her a break, Teri.

20:20.161 --> 20:22.071
Freedom, right?

20:22.071 --> 20:24.697
That is what we're fighting for.

20:24.699 --> 20:26.766
Whatever.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.366
You want to go swim against those

20:28.366 --> 20:31.125
unmarked monkeys, go for it.

20:31.125 --> 20:34.073
Just make sure you smoke 'em.

20:37.844 --> 20:39.912
Hey.

20:39.914 --> 20:41.212
The guards searched me

20:41.212 --> 20:42.622
on my way into school this morning.

20:42.622 --> 20:44.714
Did you tell anyone about
the phone? Did Lukas?

20:44.714 --> 20:46.911
No, of course not.

20:46.911 --> 20:47.915
Where is he?

20:47.915 --> 20:50.122
We need to destroy it right now.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.124
I think he's in the computer lab.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.276
But, Roman...

20:53.276 --> 20:54.515
Last time I saw Lukas, he said

20:54.515 --> 20:56.862
he'd almost decrypted that video.

20:56.864 --> 20:59.198
Thanks.

21:01.138 --> 21:02.817
Hey.

21:02.817 --> 21:04.126
Hey.

21:04.126 --> 21:06.377
I was just asking Roman
about his calculus notes.

21:06.377 --> 21:07.177
Don't.

21:07.922 --> 21:10.504
If you can't tell me
the truth, that's fine,

21:10.504 --> 21:12.678
but please don't lie to me.

21:16.292 --> 21:17.800
Hey, Sofia.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.783
I got you a present.

21:19.783 --> 21:21.833
- Seriously?
- I figured you needed

21:21.833 --> 21:23.167
some new racing threads if you're gonna

21:23.167 --> 21:25.357
be the talk of Edendale.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.100
It's awesome. Thank you.

21:31.011 --> 21:33.391
Oh, my God.

21:33.391 --> 21:35.300
What's wrong?

21:41.368 --> 21:43.300
- This is over.
- Roman...

21:43.300 --> 21:45.926
I'm talking to my sister, not you.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.315
I know you want to
honor dad... But I am not

21:50.317 --> 21:52.651
gonna let you risk your life to do it.

21:52.653 --> 21:54.920
I love you, but I'm gonna drag you out

21:54.922 --> 21:56.822
of that pool if I have to.

21:58.344 --> 22:00.292
No...

22:00.294 --> 22:02.327
You won't.

22:02.329 --> 22:04.563
- Sophia...
- Roman, let her go!

22:04.565 --> 22:05.864
You made your point.

22:05.866 --> 22:06.983
It's not about making a point.

22:06.983 --> 22:08.882
It's about keeping my sister safe!

22:08.882 --> 22:10.249
- That's my job.
- No,

22:10.249 --> 22:12.571
your job is to support her.

22:12.573 --> 22:14.940
You have no idea what you're talking about.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.045
I know you didn't want me in
the sector because you thought

22:17.045 --> 22:18.395
it was too risky.

22:18.395 --> 22:19.895
I know you wanted me

22:19.905 --> 22:20.884
to leave the carnival

22:20.884 --> 22:22.969
because you thought I was in danger.

22:22.969 --> 22:24.825
But here I am.

22:25.703 --> 22:31.289
You're here safe because I protected you.

22:31.291 --> 22:33.625
What are you talking about?

22:33.627 --> 22:36.795
Just let me do the same for my sister.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.633
So, I haven't played it yet.

22:42.633 --> 22:43.858
Thought I'd wait for you.

22:43.858 --> 22:45.327
Ready?

23:00.486 --> 23:03.221
Take him to my office.

23:06.869 --> 23:09.189
Do you know the penalties for
having a phone in the sector?

23:09.189 --> 23:10.025
I know.

23:10.025 --> 23:12.497
Confiscation of family
property, criminal prosecution,

23:12.497 --> 23:14.236
- being sent to the crate.
- I said I know.

23:14.236 --> 23:16.558
Not to mention what it would
do to the integration program

23:16.558 --> 23:18.592
if it got out that an Atrian student had

23:18.592 --> 23:20.018
a terrorist comm device.

23:20.018 --> 23:21.892
- It's not mine.
- I know.

23:24.723 --> 23:26.790
It was your father's.

23:30.223 --> 23:31.752
How did you know that?

23:31.752 --> 23:32.554
Our techs were able

23:32.554 --> 23:34.698
to retrieve that much,
but nothing else of use.

23:34.698 --> 23:36.565
- This is over, Roman.
- No, no, no, this is not over.

23:36.565 --> 23:38.270
My father is dead, and I'm not even sure

23:38.270 --> 23:39.839
I know who he was anymore.

23:42.135 --> 23:45.571
Why did he have that
phone? Who was he meeting?

23:45.573 --> 23:47.873
I knew your father.

23:47.875 --> 23:49.275
And I can tell you

23:49.281 --> 23:50.994
he was no terrorist.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.791
Now, I will make sure

23:52.791 --> 23:54.411
that the SEU guards back off your family,

23:54.411 --> 23:56.394
but if you want to honor
your father's memory,

23:56.394 --> 23:58.951
my advice would be to
forget you ever saw this.

24:04.065 --> 24:06.658
Roman, you okay?

24:06.660 --> 24:08.659
I was worried they might have
thrown you into Atrian juvie.

24:08.659 --> 24:10.330
That video text you decrypted.

24:10.330 --> 24:12.296
I saw the sender's number in sondiv.

24:12.296 --> 24:14.684
If I gave you that number,
could you find the phone?

24:14.684 --> 24:16.119
The one that sent the messages?

24:16.119 --> 24:17.081
Yeah, probably.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.141
But maybe we shouldn't.

24:18.141 --> 24:19.622
Dude, those guards are serious.

24:19.622 --> 24:21.006
Please.

24:21.006 --> 24:23.107
This is important to me.

24:24.803 --> 24:26.978
It's about my father.

24:26.980 --> 24:29.851
Whoa. The phone belonged to Nox?

24:29.851 --> 24:31.218
Why would he have a phone?

24:31.218 --> 24:33.944
I'm not sure. But
whatever his reasons were,

24:33.944 --> 24:36.221
he was willing to risk everything.

24:36.223 --> 24:38.269
That's why I have to
find that second phone.

24:38.269 --> 24:40.826
I need to know who he
was communicating with.

24:42.337 --> 24:44.294
Okay, I've set this up

24:44.294 --> 24:45.864
to ping the phone that sent the text.

24:45.866 --> 24:47.132
Ping?

24:47.134 --> 24:48.733
Yeah, um, we send the signal out

24:48.735 --> 24:50.468
to the other phone, and if it's on,

24:50.470 --> 24:52.470
we get a ping, like an echo.

24:52.472 --> 24:53.872
It'll help us find the direction.

24:53.874 --> 24:56.288
What are our chances of finding it?

24:56.288 --> 24:58.823
Are you Atrians familiar with the saying

24:58.823 --> 25:01.479
"a needle in a haystack"?

25:01.481 --> 25:03.348
Do it.

25:04.917 --> 25:07.262
Oh.

25:07.262 --> 25:09.362
What? What's wrong? Did it work?

25:09.362 --> 25:11.104
No, it's... it's saying the other phone

25:11.104 --> 25:13.241
is within a few hundred yards.

25:13.647 --> 25:15.854
Whoever your father was communicating with,

25:15.854 --> 25:17.652
is here.

25:18.479 --> 25:20.884
At school.

25:24.003 --> 25:25.573
Hey, Sophia?

25:25.573 --> 25:27.523
I just wanted to break the ice.

25:27.523 --> 25:29.059
There's a lot of hate from Collier

25:29.059 --> 25:30.957
about an alien swimming for Marshall,

25:30.957 --> 25:33.511
but I'm really looking forward to it.

25:33.513 --> 25:35.313
Thanks. I appreciate that.

25:35.313 --> 25:36.613
A peace offering.

25:36.613 --> 25:39.229
It's a sports drink... My pre-race ritual.

25:39.229 --> 25:41.162
- What's in it?
- Uh, fruit juice,

25:41.162 --> 25:43.305
electrolytes, that sort of stuff.

25:43.305 --> 25:44.443
Cheers!

25:48.327 --> 25:50.631
Good stuff, right?

25:50.631 --> 25:53.171
Oh, there's some caffeine in there, too.

25:53.171 --> 25:54.758
Wait a minute.

25:54.758 --> 25:57.753
You aliens are allergic
to that stuff, aren't you?

25:57.753 --> 26:00.037
Maybe that will slow you down.

26:02.977 --> 26:04.942
Guys, is that supposed to happen?

26:06.606 --> 26:07.878
Sophia!

26:07.880 --> 26:09.780
Sophia?

26:09.782 --> 26:13.451
Guys, she can't breathe.

26:13.453 --> 26:15.553
I need to get help.

26:18.824 --> 26:20.391
- Hey.
- Sophia.

26:20.393 --> 26:22.493
Move, move, move, move, move! Sophia.

26:22.495 --> 26:23.790
Try to breathe.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.191
Give her room.

26:26.162 --> 26:28.666
I said, get back.

26:28.668 --> 26:30.876
Why don't you get back... tattie lover?

26:30.876 --> 26:32.480
Who you calling tattie?

26:32.480 --> 26:34.538
Roman? Roman?

26:34.540 --> 26:36.473
There's something wrong with Sophia.

26:36.475 --> 26:37.923
The paramedics are on their way, but...

26:37.923 --> 26:38.758
Go!

26:38.758 --> 26:40.540
Somebody call 911!

26:42.348 --> 26:44.608
- Help me get her to the locker room.
- No, you shouldn't move her.

26:44.608 --> 26:47.325
Listen, I can help her, but
I can't do it here. Trust me.

26:48.355 --> 26:51.055
What did you give her?

26:51.057 --> 26:53.012
- Caffeine?
- It's not my fault

26:53.012 --> 26:55.425
E.T. drank it.

26:56.219 --> 26:58.717
What you're saying makes me feel unwelcome

26:58.717 --> 27:00.367
and fills me with rage.

27:00.367 --> 27:03.534
There. I used my words.

27:13.279 --> 27:16.494
Just breathe. Right. Okay.

27:16.496 --> 27:18.494
That's cyper.

27:18.494 --> 27:21.456
- Paramedics are on the way.
- She's my sister. I've got this.

27:21.456 --> 27:22.824
- No, you don't.
- She's an Atrian.

27:22.824 --> 27:24.168
You don't know the first thing about this.

27:24.170 --> 27:25.303
Please give us some privacy.

27:25.305 --> 27:27.204
Roman, I'm not going anywhere

27:27.206 --> 27:28.372
until the paramedics arrive.

27:28.374 --> 27:30.107
All right?

27:32.978 --> 27:34.547
If you can use cyper

27:34.547 --> 27:36.046
to save her, why don't you?

27:36.048 --> 27:37.782
I can't while she's here.

27:46.301 --> 27:50.060
It's anaphylaxis. She's
having an allergic reaction.

27:50.062 --> 27:51.820
- Emery, are you sure?
- This happened to me

27:51.820 --> 27:53.264
enough times. I should know better.

27:53.266 --> 27:54.565
I can fix this.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.590
- Is there epinephrine in here?
- There should be.

27:58.526 --> 28:01.138
What are you doing?!

28:28.033 --> 28:30.334
She's all right.

28:30.336 --> 28:32.369
All right?

28:32.371 --> 28:34.871
It's okay. Hey. Hey.

28:45.128 --> 28:47.083
Let her go!

28:55.927 --> 28:57.194
Come on!

28:57.196 --> 28:59.896
Screw it.

29:20.691 --> 29:22.134
Ooh!

29:25.055 --> 29:27.423
Seriously?

29:27.425 --> 29:29.759
Deal with it.

29:35.733 --> 29:38.401
The next person to throw
a punch will be expelled.

29:38.403 --> 29:39.702
The meet is canceled.

29:39.704 --> 29:40.890
Collier, head to the locker room.

29:40.890 --> 29:42.672
Marshall, to the auditorium.

29:42.674 --> 29:44.881
Now!

29:46.670 --> 29:48.411
The Marshall swim team

29:48.413 --> 29:49.979
will be suspended from competition.

29:49.981 --> 29:51.280
You'll forfeit all further matches.

29:51.282 --> 29:52.805
- Your season's over.
- Are you serious?

29:52.805 --> 29:55.084
- Wait.
- It's not their fault. It's mine.

29:55.086 --> 29:58.154
No.

29:58.156 --> 30:01.388
I put the integration
program on the line today.

30:01.392 --> 30:03.202
I trusted you all,

30:03.202 --> 30:05.928
and you let me down.

30:06.763 --> 30:09.599
Still... when Nox,

30:09.601 --> 30:11.607
one of the founding
members of this program,

30:11.607 --> 30:15.905
passed away, many feared that
his dream would die with him,

30:16.003 --> 30:19.842
but after today's events...

30:19.844 --> 30:21.811
I know that's not the case.

30:21.813 --> 30:27.416
True, the meet was an unqualified disaster,

30:27.418 --> 30:29.919
but for the first time in history,

30:29.919 --> 30:32.688
humans and Atrians were
fighting alongside each other.

30:32.690 --> 30:35.624
You were fighting for each other.

30:36.793 --> 30:39.428
And I view that as a victory...

30:39.430 --> 30:41.297
One I can build on,

30:41.299 --> 30:44.433
so there will be no
further disciplinary action.

30:45.842 --> 30:48.337
You can go.

30:49.172 --> 30:51.905
Wait.

30:51.905 --> 30:53.905
We came here to swim.

30:53.905 --> 30:55.277
After everything that's happened,

30:55.279 --> 30:56.612
can we at least have that?

30:56.614 --> 30:58.047
What's the point?

30:58.049 --> 30:59.982
We already forfeited the meet.

30:59.984 --> 31:02.017
There's no one here to see it.

31:02.019 --> 31:04.153
We're here.

31:06.656 --> 31:09.191
The pool is yours.

31:09.756 --> 31:12.361
One hour.

31:25.708 --> 31:27.269
Don't think I'm taking it easy on you

31:27.269 --> 31:29.141
because you almost just died.

31:29.143 --> 31:32.134
Don't think I'm taking it easy on you ever.

31:32.134 --> 31:34.319
On your marks,

31:34.809 --> 31:36.969
get set...

31:37.636 --> 31:38.884
Go!

31:56.680 --> 31:58.790
Thank you.

32:07.337 --> 32:09.473
So, cyper is real?

32:09.473 --> 32:10.764
You know.

32:10.764 --> 32:13.418
That's how Roman saved you.

32:13.420 --> 32:16.988
Honestly, I'm relieved.

32:16.990 --> 32:19.057
I hated having to lie to you.

32:19.059 --> 32:20.892
Why couldn't you just tell me the truth?

32:20.894 --> 32:25.530
Cyper only works when it's
mixed with Atrian blood.

32:25.532 --> 32:28.099
If people found out that
it could cure disease

32:28.101 --> 32:30.602
and bring you back from
the brink of death...

32:30.604 --> 32:32.971
Atrians would become lab rats.

32:32.973 --> 32:34.984
But Roman should know he can trust me

32:34.984 --> 32:37.169
after all we've been through.

32:37.777 --> 32:40.011
He wanted to protect you.

32:40.013 --> 32:41.617
Just knowing about cyper

32:41.617 --> 32:43.214
could be dangerous.

32:43.216 --> 32:45.417
People would kill for
that kind of information.

32:45.419 --> 32:49.354
That still doesn't explain
why he's been avoiding me.

32:49.356 --> 32:50.722
Well,

32:50.724 --> 32:54.457
all I can tell you is
that he cares about you

32:54.457 --> 32:56.694
and he'd be with you
if he thought he could,

32:56.696 --> 32:58.062
which changes everything.

32:58.064 --> 32:59.230
Right?

33:00.806 --> 33:03.234
I don't need to be protected all the time.

33:03.236 --> 33:04.836
That's not the relationship I want,

33:04.838 --> 33:09.440
but I am glad he has you and
Lukas to talk to... really.

33:10.934 --> 33:13.077
So we're okay?

33:13.079 --> 33:15.297
Always.

33:16.713 --> 33:19.951
I'd better go.

33:21.818 --> 33:24.004
Hey.

33:24.004 --> 33:25.472
So much for normal.

33:27.027 --> 33:28.732
You mean most high schools don't get

33:28.732 --> 33:30.352
into interstellar brawls?

33:30.352 --> 33:32.571
Or save aliens from medical crises.

33:34.732 --> 33:37.435
Nope, just us.

33:37.437 --> 33:40.071
What happened there?

33:40.073 --> 33:44.535
I, uh, tried to punch a Collier swimmer

33:44.535 --> 33:46.944
and missed,

33:46.946 --> 33:48.965
but this vending machine

33:48.965 --> 33:51.032
is real unhappy about getting in my face.

33:52.418 --> 33:54.752
You know, I'm quite a virtuoso

33:54.754 --> 33:56.954
with a first aid kit.

34:32.583 --> 34:34.532
Hey.

34:34.532 --> 34:36.904
Hello, Earth to Roman.

34:38.263 --> 34:40.230
So,

34:40.232 --> 34:41.632
I lost the signal.

34:41.634 --> 34:43.266
I had it, but then it started

34:43.268 --> 34:45.702
moving off fast like
someone was driving away.

34:46.938 --> 34:49.005
Uh, towards the sector?

34:49.007 --> 34:50.873
No, somewhere into the burbs.

34:50.873 --> 34:52.851
Sorry, Roman.

35:17.894 --> 35:20.804
You were right...

35:20.806 --> 35:23.139
About joining the swim team... I was naive.

35:23.141 --> 35:26.076
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

35:27.248 --> 35:29.846
I was being overprotective.

35:32.532 --> 35:34.473
And holding back the people I love...

35:34.473 --> 35:36.160
That's not...

35:36.878 --> 35:38.954
It's not serving anyone.

35:41.559 --> 35:43.560
It's just, with dad gone,

35:43.562 --> 35:45.161
I feel like I'm the one who's supposed

35:45.163 --> 35:47.497
to be looking out for you, you know?

35:50.496 --> 35:54.871
He would have been so proud
to see what you did today.

36:07.090 --> 36:10.420
Did you ever find out what
dad was doing with that phone?

36:13.192 --> 36:15.965
I know he wasn't a Trag.

36:16.573 --> 36:19.991
But he was communicating with
someone outside the sector.

36:20.843 --> 36:22.198
It must have been important enough

36:22.200 --> 36:24.911
for him to keep it a secret from us.

36:24.911 --> 36:26.569
Well, whatever the reasons are,

36:26.571 --> 36:28.404
I'll get to the bottom of it.

36:32.276 --> 36:34.709
But not tonight.

36:42.674 --> 36:45.762
No, not tonight.

36:47.496 --> 36:51.192
I'll tell the SEU guards
to back off Roman's family.

36:51.192 --> 36:53.589
I destroyed Nox's phone.

36:54.247 --> 36:56.899
Does Roman suspect anything?

36:56.901 --> 36:59.902
Roman suspects everything,
but he doesn't know for certain

36:59.904 --> 37:02.338
that I was the one who ordered the search.

37:02.340 --> 37:04.473
Make sure things stay that way.

37:04.475 --> 37:05.975
You can count on me.

37:05.977 --> 37:07.376
I appreciate it

37:07.378 --> 37:09.912
and I'll repay the favor, but, Castor,

37:09.914 --> 37:13.119
do not try to leverage
this or use it against me.

37:13.119 --> 37:15.229
That's not a mistake
you can afford to make.

37:15.229 --> 37:17.319
I wouldn't dream of it.

37:17.321 --> 37:19.088
Glad to be of service.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.725
Show daddy how you swim.

37:35.725 --> 37:37.261
Let's get in.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.508
Do you want to get in?

37:39.510 --> 37:41.276
Should we get in?

37:41.278 --> 37:42.778
Yeah?

37:45.006 --> 37:47.000
Are you seeing this, Nox?

37:47.091 --> 37:49.551
Here we go. Yeah.

37:49.553 --> 37:51.687
He's amazing.

37:53.523 --> 37:55.390
Our son is amazing.

37:57.423 --> 37:59.103
Show daddy how you swim.

37:59.103 --> 38:02.014
Come on, show him. Show him.

38:02.014 --> 38:05.067
Yeah. Yeah, there you go.

38:05.069 --> 38:07.558
Oh, you're doing great.
