00:03.086 --> 00:04.128
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:04.295 --> 00:05.754
Hold on a second.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.468
Nice. Nice.

00:11.803 --> 00:13.095
I got you something.

00:13.346 --> 00:16.181
- What's this?
- Eight hundred and twelve bucks.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.268
I don't know what Big Leon told you,
but it's a thousand...

00:19.477 --> 00:21.395
...if you want me for the whole night.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.690
- What is this for?
- Well, I'm making money now.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.985
And this is paying you back
for headshots, electric bills...

00:28.153 --> 00:30.487
...and so many slices of pizza
I can't even count.

00:30.655 --> 00:33.615
- I love you, man.
- Well, thanks, man.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.075
Now I can get my pony.

00:36.369 --> 00:40.873
Hey. This is a little extra something
for always being there for me.

00:41.791 --> 00:51.884
Wow, I don't know what to say.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.804
- Eh? What do you say?
- I don't know.

00:57.682 --> 00:58.724
It's a bracelet.

00:58.975 --> 01:02.061
Isn't it? It's engraved too. Check it out.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.229
"To my best bud."

01:09.444 --> 01:10.569
Thanks, best bud.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.323
- Put it on.
- Oh. Now?

01:16.493 --> 01:19.411
No, something this nice should be saved
for a special occasion.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.581
No, that's the beauty part.
It goes with everything.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.751
When you put this on,
you're good to go.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.299
Oh, man!

01:32.717 --> 01:35.427
You are so wearing that bracelet!

01:36.262 --> 01:37.971
I so am!

01:38.848 --> 01:41.725
Oh! Any idea what this will
do for your sex life?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.811
It'll probably slow it down at first...

01:43.978 --> 01:47.106
...but once I'm used to the extra weight,
I'll be back on track.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.490
- This all looks good.
- Great.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.827
If I want to call for a reference
on your last job?

02:42.036 --> 02:45.205
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see?
The manager, Chandler Bing?

02:45.582 --> 02:46.748
All right.

02:46.958 --> 02:51.003
Let's see if you're as good in person
as you are on paper. Make me a salad.

02:51.337 --> 02:54.506
A salad? I could do
something more complicated.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.509
No, just the salad will be fine.

02:58.386 --> 02:59.428
You got it.

02:59.596 --> 03:04.266
Now I want you to tell me
what you're doing while you're doing it.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.395
All right. Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.063
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?

03:10.273 --> 03:11.732
Oh, no, no. I'm gonna wash it.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.193
Don't. I like it dirty.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.405
That's your call.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.742
So, uh, what are you going to do next?

03:21.993 --> 03:24.494
I thought that I'd
cut up the tomatoes.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.997
Are they firm?

03:29.250 --> 03:32.294
- They're okay.
- You sure they haven't gone bad?

03:32.503 --> 03:35.172
You sure they're not very, very bad?

03:38.384 --> 03:40.469
Ahem. No, really, they're okay.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.971
You gonna slice them up real nice?

03:43.181 --> 03:45.098
I was going to do them julienne.

03:47.977 --> 03:49.228
I'm out of here!

03:57.862 --> 03:59.238
Hello?

03:59.822 --> 04:02.366
Rachel's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

04:02.617 --> 04:04.493
All right. And how do we spell Casey?

04:04.661 --> 04:07.454
Is it like "at the bat"
or "and The Sunshine Band"?

04:08.539 --> 04:10.040
Okay, bye-bye.

04:12.168 --> 04:13.794
Hey, who's this Casey?

04:14.003 --> 04:15.629
Some guy she met at the movies.

04:15.838 --> 04:17.589
What does he want with her?

04:17.839 --> 04:19.966
I'm guessing he wants to
do a little dance...

04:22.011 --> 04:24.263
...you know, make a little love...

04:27.183 --> 04:29.518
Well, pretty much get down tonight.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.400
I don't know. I don't...

04:36.651 --> 04:40.237
I don't get it! Two months ago,
Rachel and I were this close.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.865
Now I'm taking messages from guys
she meets at the movies?

04:44.075 --> 04:48.036
I mean, this Casey should be
taking down my messages, you know?

04:48.830 --> 04:51.248
Or Rachel and I should be together...

04:51.457 --> 04:54.501
...and we should get
some kind of message service.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.087
Hang in there.
It's gonna happen.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.755
Now how do you know that?

04:59.465 --> 05:01.758
Because she's your lobster.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.512
Oh, she's going somewhere.

05:07.807 --> 05:12.185
It's a known fact that lobsters
fall in love and mate for life.

05:12.395 --> 05:16.523
You know what? You can actually
see old lobster couples...

05:16.733 --> 05:20.485
...walking around their tank,
holding claws, like...

05:24.615 --> 05:26.158
Hey, you feeling better?

05:26.367 --> 05:29.745
Yeah, I think that fifth shower
actually got the interview off me.

05:30.538 --> 05:32.497
So do you have any other possibilities?

05:32.707 --> 05:35.959
Yeah. There is the possibility
that I won't make rent.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.128
Monica, if you want,
I can lend you money.

05:38.713 --> 05:41.131
No, no. If I couldn't pay you
back right away...

05:41.299 --> 05:43.800
...then I'd feel guilty and tense
every time I saw you.

05:43.968 --> 05:47.012
Oh. Then why don't you borrow it
from Mom and Dad?

05:47.221 --> 05:50.015
You feel guilty and tense
around them already.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.809
Might as well
make some money off of them.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.437
- The man's got a point.
- Ohh.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.565
What is that sparkly thing?

05:59.317 --> 06:01.193
That thing? It's a, uh...

06:03.529 --> 06:05.655
Yeah, it's a little flashy.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.908
No, no.

06:08.076 --> 06:11.620
No, no. It's not flashy.
Not for a goodfella.

06:13.748 --> 06:18.668
Man, that is sharp! That must
have cost you quite a few doubloons.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.549
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.676
- Hi, darling.
- So what's this?

06:26.928 --> 06:28.345
Some of your old stuff.

06:28.596 --> 06:34.184
Well, sweetie, we have a surprise for you.
We're turning your room into a gym.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.397
Wow, that is a surprise!

06:38.606 --> 06:41.066
Just one little question.
Why not Ross' room?

06:41.317 --> 06:42.692
Gosh, we talked about that...

06:42.902 --> 06:47.572
...but your brother had so many science
trophies, plaques, merit badges...

06:47.824 --> 06:49.699
Well, we didn't want to disturb them.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.326
God forbid!

06:54.330 --> 06:55.914
- Ohh.
- Hi.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.874
Hi, Rachel. Aww.

06:58.042 --> 07:01.420
We were so sorry to hear
about your parents splitting up.

07:01.629 --> 07:05.382
Well, they're just separated.
You never know! We'll see.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.801
I can't say any of us were surprised.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.472
Your parents have been unhappy
ever since we've known them.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.892
- Oh.
- Especially after that incident in Hawaii.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.813
What? What incident?

07:20.022 --> 07:23.233
Um, no, no.
I must be thinking of someone else.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.068
Maybe me! Ha!

07:25.319 --> 07:29.239
Don't you have some folding to do?
Go fold, dear. Fold. You fold.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.912
- Want a refill?
- No. I'm all right, thanks.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.543
You gotta give me a second.
I want to get this just right.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.503
Ahem.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.509
Dude, 11:00,
totally hot babe checking you out.

07:52.138 --> 07:56.141
That was really good.
I think I'm ready for my penis now.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.194
I know what you're thinking.
Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.

08:09.113 --> 08:10.822
- I'm Gail.
- Chandler.

08:12.241 --> 08:16.703
I... I really have to be somewhere,
but it was nice meeting you.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.039
What?

08:25.129 --> 08:26.296
This is excellent!

08:26.464 --> 08:29.174
He could've gotten me a VCR
or a set of golf clubs.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.468
But no! He has to get me
the "woman repeller"!

08:33.221 --> 08:35.597
The eyesore from
the Liberace House of Crap!

08:36.599 --> 08:38.683
- It's not that bad.
- Easy for you to say.

08:38.893 --> 08:42.020
You're not sporting a reject
from the Mr. T collection!

08:42.188 --> 08:43.438
Chandler. Chandler.

08:43.648 --> 08:47.192
"I pity the fool that puts on
my jewelry! I do! I do!

08:47.401 --> 08:49.402
I pity that fool..." Ay.

08:51.113 --> 08:54.366
Hey, man!
We were just doing some impressions.

08:54.575 --> 08:55.992
Do your Marcel Marceau.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.788
That's actually good.

09:08.714 --> 09:12.509
Would you look at that guy?
How long has he been talking to her?

09:12.718 --> 09:16.846
It's like, back off, buddy!
She's a waitress, not a geisha.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.224
I think she's okay.

09:20.393 --> 09:24.187
Look at that! See how she's
pushing him away and he won't budge?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.273
I'm gonna do something.

09:28.109 --> 09:32.571
We'll get a condo right on the mountain.
Ski in, ski out, it's great.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.532
Excuse me? Are you Rachel?

09:36.075 --> 09:37.075
What?

09:37.910 --> 09:39.369
Ross Geller.

09:40.079 --> 09:43.373
God, in your ad you said
you were pretty, but wow!

09:45.084 --> 09:46.418
What are you doing?

09:46.627 --> 09:49.462
Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?

09:50.715 --> 09:52.090
I don't believe it!

09:52.300 --> 09:55.135
If it works out, we'll have something
to tell the grandkids!

09:55.469 --> 09:56.678
You sure will.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.638
I've gotta go.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.640
- Take care.
- Okay.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.058
- See you later.
- Ohh.

10:05.646 --> 10:06.980
You're welcome.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.067
- What?
- I was saving you.

10:11.319 --> 10:14.988
Saving me from the pleasant conversation
with the interesting man?

10:15.197 --> 10:18.074
- From where I was...
- Okay, Ross, listen to me.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.952
I am not yours to save.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.872
- But you are.
- What?

10:24.040 --> 10:26.583
Uh, well, um... You're my lobster.

10:30.504 --> 10:33.340
Okay. Are you being
the blind-date guy again?

10:34.675 --> 10:37.385
No, you're my lobster.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.055
See, um... Lobsters...

10:40.222 --> 10:43.600
Uh, in the tank, when they're old...

10:44.644 --> 10:48.605
...they get with the...
They walk around holding the claws.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.025
In the tank!
You know, with...

10:53.194 --> 10:54.944
...with the holding and...

10:55.154 --> 10:58.031
Pheebs, you wanna help me
with the lobster thing?

10:58.240 --> 11:00.075
Do the claws again.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.287
Rach, forget the lobsters, okay?

11:04.538 --> 11:06.289
Let's talk... What about us?

11:06.499 --> 11:09.751
Ross, there is no "us," okay?

11:09.919 --> 11:12.379
- No, but...
- No! Listen to me!

11:12.588 --> 11:14.881
I fell for you and I get clobbered.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.009
You then fall for me
and I again get clobbered.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.846
I'm tired of being clobbered,
you know?

11:22.139 --> 11:23.640
It's just not worth it.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.100
Well, but...

11:25.351 --> 11:27.227
No "but," Ross.

11:27.478 --> 11:31.314
We are never gonna happen, okay?
Accept that.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.526
Except... Except that what?

11:37.029 --> 11:39.114
No. No.

11:39.865 --> 11:43.034
Accept that.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.497
Oh.

11:52.628 --> 11:56.214
Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud!
How you doing?

11:57.883 --> 12:00.760
Wow. You're getting good at that
Marcel Marceau thing.

12:02.847 --> 12:06.015
What do you say we play some ball?
You and me, huh? What do you say?

12:08.936 --> 12:10.520
Okay, that's my bad.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.316
If you hated the bracelet,
you should have just said so.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.569
Doesn't the fact that I wore it...

12:17.778 --> 12:20.655
...say how much
our friendship means to me?

12:20.865 --> 12:24.784
What about the fact that you insulted
the bracelet and you made fun of me?

12:25.369 --> 12:28.037
Well, that's the part
where I'm a wank.

12:28.372 --> 12:31.166
I was hoping you
wouldn't focus on that.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.170
Come on, man!
I said I was sorry a hundred times.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.839
I promise, I will never
take it off my...

12:38.841 --> 12:39.841
...wrist.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.889
But if you want to stay in there
and be mad...

12:46.098 --> 12:48.057
...you just, you stay in there.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.934
You know what the...

12:50.728 --> 12:52.187
I am here, on my knees...

12:54.273 --> 12:56.816
...holding up these couch cushions...

12:57.026 --> 12:59.736
...as a symbol
of my sorrow and regret.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.157
Much like they did
in biblical times.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.242
Though you may haveth anger now...

13:12.041 --> 13:15.168
You know, that Steffi Graf
has quite a tush.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.630
I'm just saying! It's right there!

13:19.507 --> 13:21.966
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, darling.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.385
Where's my grandson?
You didn't bring him?

13:24.637 --> 13:27.472
No. He's at Carol and Susan's today.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.974
A woman in my office is a lesbian.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.144
I'm just saying!

13:34.230 --> 13:37.732
Jack, look! There's that house
paint commercial that cracks you up!

13:43.614 --> 13:45.782
- Where have you been?
- Emotional hell.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.575
So did they lend you the money?

13:47.785 --> 13:49.619
No, I haven't asked them yet.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.454
Come on, Monica, do it.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.122
Hey, you guys.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.416
Monica has some news.

13:56.752 --> 14:00.922
So listen, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you this before, but...

14:01.966 --> 14:05.718
...I'm no longer at my job.
I had to leave it.

14:05.928 --> 14:09.180
- Why?
- Because they made me.

14:10.391 --> 14:14.310
You were fired?
What are you gonna do?

14:14.520 --> 14:18.815
Judy, relax. This is our little Harmonica
we're talking about.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.275
We taught her well.

14:20.484 --> 14:24.654
- Ten percent of your paycheck goes where?
- In the bank.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.408
So she dips into her savings.
That's what it's there for.

14:28.617 --> 14:29.993
She's gonna be fine.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.036
If you need a little extra...

14:32.246 --> 14:34.414
...you know where to find it.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.708
Anything larger back there?

14:38.544 --> 14:40.086
I can't believe it!

14:40.337 --> 14:41.880
Would you stop already?

14:42.089 --> 14:45.091
Get out of the bitter barn
and play in the hay.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.802
Oh, you're right.
I should play in the hay.

14:48.053 --> 14:52.307
For about the fact I just dropped $400
to replace a bracelet I hated to begin with.

14:52.516 --> 14:54.225
Bring on the hay!

14:55.060 --> 14:56.227
Hey!

14:58.230 --> 15:00.648
I've got something
that'll make you happy.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.567
Guess what Gunther found?

15:02.985 --> 15:04.652
Ohh!

15:05.237 --> 15:06.696
Hey, now you have two!

15:08.908 --> 15:10.199
Oh, now you have two.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.871
What am I gonna do?

15:15.456 --> 15:19.500
Hey.

15:20.794 --> 15:22.378
How come you have two?

15:24.089 --> 15:25.256
This one's for you.

15:26.508 --> 15:29.052
- Get out!
- No, I can't.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.681
I know how much this means to you...

15:33.849 --> 15:36.184
...and I also know this is
about more than jewelry.

15:36.393 --> 15:39.938
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're "best buds."

15:41.482 --> 15:44.984
Wow. Is this friendship? I think so!

15:46.528 --> 15:49.113
Check it out!
We're bracelet buddies!

15:49.698 --> 15:51.783
That's what they'll call us!

15:53.911 --> 15:56.996
Okay, here you go.
Pay me back whenever you like.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.332
You have dinosaur checks?

16:00.209 --> 16:03.920
Yeah. You get your money
and you learn something.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.380
What's wrong with that?

16:05.589 --> 16:06.798
Nothing.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.717
Hey, you're a cheap-a-saurus!

16:11.845 --> 16:15.223
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Thank you, I'm very grateful.

16:15.432 --> 16:16.891
Hey, Mon, what is this?

16:17.935 --> 16:19.185
Oh, um...

16:19.353 --> 16:23.356
That's my bathing suit from high school.
I was a little bigger then.

16:24.566 --> 16:28.069
Oh, I thought that's what they used
to cover Connecticut when it rains.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.447
Hey, what's on this videotape?

16:31.657 --> 16:33.324
You got me. Let's put it in.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.998
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.628
Over here, Jack. Okay.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.964
Rachel's coming up the path.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.341
Doesn't she look pretty? Jack?

16:50.551 --> 16:51.718
Can you get this?

16:54.722 --> 16:56.222
Oh, my God!

16:56.890 --> 16:58.433
What is with your nose?

17:01.103 --> 17:04.896
They had to reduce it
because of my deviated septum.

17:05.232 --> 17:09.152
Okay, I was wrong. That's
what they use to cover Connecticut.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.156
- This is us getting ready for the prom.
- Ah!

17:13.574 --> 17:16.117
- We don't have to watch.
- Yeah, we do.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.743
- Come on!
- It's fun!

17:17.994 --> 17:19.369
Get a shot of Monica.

17:19.621 --> 17:22.080
- Where's Monica?
- Over here, Dad!

17:23.000 --> 17:25.209
Wait. How do you zoom out?

17:26.837 --> 17:28.963
There she is!

17:32.384 --> 17:34.177
Some girl ate Monica!

17:36.430 --> 17:39.390
Shut up!
The camera adds ten pounds.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.226
So how many cameras
are actually on you?

17:45.439 --> 17:47.356
Oh, you look so great!

17:47.608 --> 17:50.318
So do you! You look beautiful!

17:51.153 --> 17:52.445
- Oops.
- What?

17:52.613 --> 17:54.280
I think I got mayonnaise on you.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.033
Oh, it's just the shoulder,
not my dress.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.162
Everybody smile!

18:01.872 --> 18:03.414
Oh, Dad, turn it off!

18:03.624 --> 18:06.959
- It is off.
- It is not! What's with the red light?

18:07.169 --> 18:10.463
It's the off light. Right, Ross?

18:18.472 --> 18:20.598
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.563
- You look pretty tonight.
- Oh, thanks.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.861
- What are you doing this summer?
- I'm gonna hang out...

18:34.113 --> 18:36.114
...work on my music.

18:39.743 --> 18:42.995
Is my hook unhooked?
These things keep falling down.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.755
Let me see. I don't know.
What are you gonna do...

18:54.133 --> 18:55.716
Oh! The guys are here!

18:55.968 --> 18:57.135
- This summer?

18:57.344 --> 18:58.427
Work on your music?

19:04.309 --> 19:06.269
Oh, my God! There's Roy Gublik!

19:06.937 --> 19:10.690
You know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.191
His name was in the paper.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.988
Where's Chip?
Why isn't he here yet?

19:17.197 --> 19:19.907
He'll be here, okay? Take a chill pill.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.827
There.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.960
I just told Rachel
that Roy touched my boob.

19:33.130 --> 19:37.425
I can't go to the prom without a date.
I can't! It's too late!

19:37.718 --> 19:40.595
If you're not going,
then I don't want to go either.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.347
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!

19:45.017 --> 19:47.185
I have a wonderful idea.

19:47.394 --> 19:50.146
You should take Rachel to the prom.

19:51.273 --> 19:55.318
- Doubtful.
- Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.113
All right, go on. This thing's heavy.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.909
Your mother's right. Take her.
You can wear my tux.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.577
She won't wanna go with me.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.705
Of course she would!
You're a college man!

20:08.332 --> 20:10.208
- I don't know.
- Well, come on.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.251
Don't you wanna find out?

20:13.670 --> 20:15.963
I can't believe I can't go to the prom!

20:16.173 --> 20:17.715
This is so harsh!

20:22.346 --> 20:25.348
- Hold my board.
- Attaboy! Attaboy!

20:25.766 --> 20:27.433
I think we've seen enough.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.477
- Let's turn it off.
- No, no, no!

20:29.937 --> 20:31.646
Well, I'm not gonna watch.

20:32.689 --> 20:34.357
Come on, kid. Let's go!

20:36.610 --> 20:40.238
- My! Are you handsome!
- Let's show them!

20:40.489 --> 20:42.156
Just a sec, Dad.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.618
Okay, be cool. Just be cool.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.420
Okay, Dad.

20:56.588 --> 21:00.424
Rachel, ready or not,
here comes your knight in shining...

21:00.634 --> 21:01.884
Oh, no.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.053
Bye! Don't wait up!

21:04.471 --> 21:06.013
Chip!

21:07.975 --> 21:09.558
Oh, dear!

21:09.726 --> 21:11.435
Jack. How do I turn this off?

21:11.853 --> 21:12.979
Press the button.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.106
Which one? Which button? Jack!

21:15.315 --> 21:16.899
The button! The button!

21:20.946 --> 21:23.114
I can't believe you did that.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.119
Yeah, well...

21:56.398 --> 21:58.733
See? He's her lobster!

22:07.200 --> 22:08.826
Dance with him!

22:08.994 --> 22:10.494
Mom, I'm hungry!

22:10.954 --> 22:12.705
Dance with your father.

22:12.914 --> 22:17.209
I don't know any of your flashdances,
but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.170
All right.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.511
- Oh, Jack!
- Oh, Judy!

22:31.224 --> 22:33.100
Oh, Judy!
