WEBVTT

00:54.333 --> 00:55.900
Chul-young, kidnapped by Hyun-jun,

00:56.600 --> 00:59.766
decides to help Hyun-jun
stop the war from happening.

01:01.866 --> 01:02.933
Hyun-jun and Sun-hwa

01:03.400 --> 01:07.033
run into Seung-hee in the bunker
where the nuclear bomb was made,

01:07.500 --> 01:11.133
and run from Sa-woo's chase
with the help from Seung-hee.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.166
Don't come near me.

01:15.766 --> 01:16.966
Why did you change so much?

01:18.700 --> 01:22.366
Myung-ho Cho arrests Gi-hoon Yeon
with Chul-young's help,

01:23.000 --> 01:25.900
but Gi-hoon Yeon gets killed by Vick.

01:30.566 --> 01:33.366
Myung-ho Cho arrests San Baek and Sa-woo

01:33.866 --> 01:36.133
to find the location of the nuclear bomb.

01:38.100 --> 01:40.633
Where is the nuclear bomb located?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.033
With Chul-young's help,

01:42.466 --> 01:46.066
Hyun-jun and Sun-hwa find out that
the target is Gwanghwamun,

01:46.733 --> 01:48.600
and head there.

01:58.666 --> 02:00.200
EPISODE 17

02:43.500 --> 02:46.000
I've linked together
all of the destinations in the GPS.

02:53.300 --> 02:56.500
Gwanghwamun, Deoksugung, Namdaemun
Market, Seoul Station, USO,

02:57.033 --> 02:58.166
Yongsan Station,

02:59.000 --> 03:00.366
National Museum of Korea,

03:01.066 --> 03:02.866
War Memorial of Korea, Yongsan Garrison,

03:04.133 --> 03:05.166
Gwanghwamun?

03:19.500 --> 03:20.433
Follow me!

03:28.033 --> 03:29.200
Check the compartment!

03:59.000 --> 04:00.066
It's not in the compartment.

04:47.466 --> 04:48.366
Run!

05:45.233 --> 05:46.166
This is breaking news.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.766
Casualties are rising

05:47.933 --> 05:50.566
in the Gwanghwamun Plaza as
a gunfight has broken out

05:50.766 --> 05:52.233
with semi-automatic firearm.

05:52.566 --> 05:53.466
Also currently,

05:53.533 --> 05:55.900
all communication around
Gwanghwamun has been disabled,

05:56.100 --> 05:58.700
and there is no confirmation of
police force intervention.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.133
-But according to a government employee,
-We will...

06:01.500 --> 06:02.666
head over to Gwanghwamun too.

06:03.300 --> 06:04.366
This is not a drill...

07:30.133 --> 07:31.600
I will follow you to the end.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.133
-Captain.
-I will also follow you to the end.

07:48.366 --> 07:49.300
Duck!

07:57.766 --> 07:59.100
Ahh!

08:25.700 --> 08:26.700
Kwang-su!

08:26.766 --> 08:27.700
Hurry up and move!

09:18.500 --> 09:19.666
I'll cover you!

09:19.900 --> 09:21.000
Run through the back!

09:22.933 --> 09:23.833
Hurry!

10:26.166 --> 10:27.100
Move!

11:07.566 --> 11:08.666
Democratic...

11:08.833 --> 11:09.900
People's...

12:16.000 --> 12:17.266
The President is here.

12:34.433 --> 12:37.866
With the recent events around Gwanghwamun,
I am sure that many of you are

12:38.400 --> 12:40.533
surprised as well as curious
about many things.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.333
I will tell you everything that
needs to be told.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.733
Who was behind the attack?

12:48.933 --> 12:50.200
Uh... they were

12:50.466 --> 12:51.666
agents from the

12:52.100 --> 12:53.933
Operational Unit of the Labor Party.

12:54.433 --> 12:57.433
They planned to detonate a bomb
at Gwanghwamun,

12:58.233 --> 12:59.333
but our intelligence agency

12:59.900 --> 13:02.233
identified the issue ahead of time
and reacted appropriately,

13:02.933 --> 13:04.700
and killed all of the terrorists.

13:04.766 --> 13:06.066
If agents from the North

13:06.400 --> 13:08.700
committed terrorist activities
in the heart of Seoul,

13:09.033 --> 13:09.933
shouldn't we be

13:10.266 --> 13:11.766
taking follow-up measures?

13:11.933 --> 13:14.666
While it's true that they were
agents from the North,

13:14.933 --> 13:15.900
we found the recent attack

13:16.000 --> 13:18.766
was not intended by the Chairman of the
National Defense Commission.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.833
They are rebellious forces
within the military

13:21.033 --> 13:23.266
who came here to start a war.

13:24.066 --> 13:25.500
During the terror attack in Seoul,

13:26.533 --> 13:27.500
a coup d'Ã©tat

13:28.233 --> 13:30.100
was being planned in the North.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.066
I've been pushing for a

13:38.133 --> 13:40.200
summit discussion
with the North for a while.

13:40.666 --> 13:42.500
Please excuse me for keeping this a secret

13:42.966 --> 13:45.033
in order to establish the

13:45.533 --> 13:47.033
summit discussion.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.600
Is the summit still happening

13:48.900 --> 13:51.133
in light of these events?

13:51.600 --> 13:52.533
Yes...

13:52.866 --> 13:54.866
though it's delayed more than anticipated,

13:56.400 --> 13:57.466
the summit discussion

13:58.400 --> 14:00.466
will happen.

14:09.700 --> 14:10.833
It's me.

14:12.666 --> 14:14.633
The President has not changed his mind.

14:15.900 --> 14:16.733
Yes.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.233
The summit discussion

14:20.966 --> 14:22.566
will continue as planned.

14:25.066 --> 14:26.733
In light of recent events,

14:27.466 --> 14:29.633
the NSS has lost its credibility as
an information agency,

14:30.266 --> 14:31.933
and lost its ability as well.

14:32.633 --> 14:33.766
The President

14:34.266 --> 14:35.866
is heavily worried about this,

14:36.533 --> 14:39.633
and wants the NSS
to quickly recover to its original state.

14:40.733 --> 14:42.233
Like typical information agencies,

14:42.833 --> 14:45.033
we've come here with no changes,

14:45.600 --> 14:47.433
and it has rotted to the core.

14:48.433 --> 14:50.000
Starting with the traitor director.

14:50.900 --> 14:52.466
The NSS has a big hole.

14:53.333 --> 14:56.300
Losing the home ground to the terrorists.

14:56.466 --> 14:57.733
The NSS is weak.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.300
I...

15:01.033 --> 15:02.600
cannot accept this.

15:03.266 --> 15:05.166
I will cut out the rotten parts,

15:06.233 --> 15:08.366
and anyone in the way of its recovery

15:09.033 --> 15:10.533
will be removed immediately.

15:13.733 --> 15:14.766
Get back to work.

15:20.633 --> 15:21.566
I mean,

15:22.266 --> 15:25.666
what does he know about our field
that he's talking big, huh?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.000
Even the Director was a traitor.

15:28.766 --> 15:30.200
Why wouldn't he talk big?

15:32.833 --> 15:33.766
I mean...

15:34.533 --> 15:35.966
am I wrong?

15:36.400 --> 15:37.833
What the Head of National Defense said,

15:38.300 --> 15:39.366
it's all true.

15:40.100 --> 15:43.166
The still water was rotten to begin with.

15:43.666 --> 15:44.966
We don't do anything to change--

15:45.066 --> 15:46.166
We're the rotten water?

15:46.333 --> 15:48.133
Are you already climbing
the corporate ladder?

15:48.300 --> 15:52.100
In your eyes, this guy may seem like
the leader to follow.

15:52.433 --> 15:55.266
But in my eyes, he's the rotten one.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.133
Listen to me.

15:57.333 --> 15:58.666
You never know when he'll break.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.233
Be careful.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.366
Oops.

16:01.466 --> 16:02.766
Ouch it hurts.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.166
Darn it.

16:08.800 --> 16:09.933
He drives me nuts.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.766
Wow, all this and that...

16:16.300 --> 16:17.400
It's going to be exhausting.

16:21.600 --> 16:22.533
Yeah, it's me.

16:23.366 --> 16:24.366
What?

16:26.066 --> 16:27.266
Oh, okay.

16:31.566 --> 16:33.000
We've located Hyun-jun.

16:33.700 --> 16:34.700
Where is he?

16:34.900 --> 16:36.133
The National Intelligence Service.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.466
Director San Baek and Sa-woo Jin

16:41.166 --> 16:42.533
are also getting interrogated there.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.966
Can I see Hyun-jun?

16:47.033 --> 16:48.100
Wait a bit longer.

16:49.233 --> 16:50.466
The Blue House...

16:50.533 --> 16:53.100
seems to be interested in him.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.166
It'll soon be resolved.

17:04.433 --> 17:06.800
How's the investigation on Iris going?

17:08.033 --> 17:09.566
To identify them

17:09.633 --> 17:12.433
within the Blue House and other areas
within the government,

17:12.900 --> 17:16.433
we need San Baek to talk,
but it's not easy.

17:17.433 --> 17:19.466
What Iris is about,

17:20.500 --> 17:22.066
how much influence they have,

17:22.866 --> 17:24.433
we still don't have any lead on them.

17:24.866 --> 17:27.166
If we can't identify
who is behind San Baek,

17:28.133 --> 17:30.100
their plots will continue

17:30.900 --> 17:32.833
as we move ahead
with the summit discussion.

17:33.933 --> 17:35.266
We must find out.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.166
Yes, sir.

17:37.933 --> 17:40.133
Oh, where is Hyun-jun Kim?

17:40.700 --> 17:42.933
He's being interrogated at the NIS.

17:49.733 --> 17:51.733
THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

17:52.366 --> 17:55.233
After the murder of President
Seong-cheol Yun, you escaped Hungary,

17:55.900 --> 17:58.033
went to Japan through Russia,

17:58.666 --> 18:01.066
and met Sun-hwa Kim in Akita, Japan.

18:01.133 --> 18:04.766
Then joined Chul-young Park's crew
in Shanghai via Sun-hwa Kim.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.533
Is that correct?

18:08.433 --> 18:09.333
Yes.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.600
Your choice to join them,
knowing they were agents from the North,

18:14.666 --> 18:17.766
was a clear act of treachery and betrayal
to South Korea.

18:18.900 --> 18:19.866
Why did you do it?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.000
All I thought about was

18:22.800 --> 18:24.066
to take revenge on

18:24.600 --> 18:26.833
Korea that abandoned me,
and Director San Baek.

18:32.033 --> 18:34.100
After I failed to protect
President Seong-cheol Yun,

18:35.666 --> 18:37.233
I got summoned to the North,

18:38.133 --> 18:39.433
and was imprisoned.

18:39.566 --> 18:42.000
But you received the order
to kill Hyun-jun Kim,

18:43.700 --> 18:44.966
and went to Japan?

18:45.066 --> 18:46.100
Yes.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.400
After you failed to kill Hyun-jun Kim,

18:51.866 --> 18:53.066
you stated

18:53.966 --> 18:55.966
that you lived with Hyun-jun Kim
in the same house.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.200
How could you do that?

19:02.033 --> 19:05.700
You also stopped the nuclear attack
with Hyun-jun Kim.

19:07.033 --> 19:08.366
What made you

19:09.733 --> 19:11.900
turn against your fellow comrades?

19:15.400 --> 19:16.500
Tell me.

19:19.566 --> 19:20.400
Now,

19:21.833 --> 19:23.466
let's talk about Sa-woo Jin.

19:27.066 --> 19:27.966
The two of you.

19:28.733 --> 19:31.300
You were best friends since
you were in the task force together?

19:32.333 --> 19:33.233
Yes.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.733
But he tried to kill you.

19:38.866 --> 19:42.000
When do you think Sa-woo Jin
became part of Iris?

19:43.833 --> 19:44.866
I'm not sure.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.766
Are you really friends?

19:50.333 --> 19:52.700
What do you know about Sa-woo Jin?

19:57.366 --> 19:58.533
Tell me whatever you know.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.800
You've always been like that!

20:02.066 --> 20:03.733
You never knew anything about me.

20:04.866 --> 20:05.866
How much pain I endured,

20:06.633 --> 20:08.266
because of you,

20:09.433 --> 20:10.633
and what I had to give up,

20:11.033 --> 20:12.466
because of you,

20:13.466 --> 20:15.000
you didn't even notice.

20:17.233 --> 20:19.133
So why does it matter when it all started?

20:21.333 --> 20:23.666
What's the use of it now?

20:26.400 --> 20:28.166
I tried to kill you!

20:28.933 --> 20:29.966
And in that moment!

20:31.433 --> 20:32.900
In my heart!

20:33.633 --> 20:34.700
You were nonexistent!

21:26.700 --> 21:28.633
She works for the company
of my hometown friend.

21:29.566 --> 21:31.766
My heart is pounding so much
that I can't even describe her.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.033
She's exactly my type,
and she's killer hot.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.500
Why are you doing this to us?

21:38.233 --> 21:40.933
Short period, it must have been tough.

21:42.033 --> 21:44.533
It's... an initiation ceremony to

21:44.966 --> 21:46.500
become NSS agents.

21:48.866 --> 21:50.233
Hey you.

21:50.533 --> 21:53.400
You have a girl you want to love
with everything you have.

21:53.500 --> 21:54.766
That girl you met in college.

21:55.766 --> 21:56.966
That's Seung-hee.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.966
We got really close

22:00.133 --> 22:01.900
after Hyun-jun joined the NSS.

22:03.233 --> 22:05.066
That night we went to
the Deputy Director's house,

22:06.233 --> 22:07.666
we kissed for the first time.

22:09.433 --> 22:10.433
I'm sorry.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.033
It's an order.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.333
If you were me...

22:26.766 --> 22:28.166
You know what

22:28.500 --> 22:29.500
really scares me?

22:30.200 --> 22:31.233
That I

22:31.900 --> 22:33.800
dragged you into the NSS.

22:34.733 --> 22:36.233
I've always thought of you more

22:37.733 --> 22:39.333
as a brother than a hometown kid.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.366
Please stop.

22:40.566 --> 22:41.500
Tell me.

22:42.466 --> 22:43.633
Why are you doing this?

22:45.133 --> 22:46.233
Who are you doing this for?

22:46.500 --> 22:47.900
For what?

22:50.466 --> 22:51.400
Tell me, now.

22:52.166 --> 22:53.300
When did it start?

22:54.066 --> 22:55.700
When you pointed a gun at me in Hungary,

22:58.166 --> 22:59.433
what were you then?

23:03.100 --> 23:04.100
Iris?

23:06.733 --> 23:07.966
Or my friend?

23:08.900 --> 23:11.333
What difference does it make,
to talk about your feelings now?

23:11.600 --> 23:13.766
What difference does it make
if I understand you now?

23:16.533 --> 23:18.200
Even if Hyun-jun forgives you,

23:20.433 --> 23:21.900
I'll never forgive you.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.233
Isn't it quiet as if nothing happened?

24:17.666 --> 24:19.100
Had the bomb went off...

24:21.066 --> 24:22.900
I don't even want to imagine.

24:23.866 --> 24:25.500
You've done more than enough

24:26.266 --> 24:28.533
by stopping the nuclear attack.

24:30.266 --> 24:31.200
If you have

24:31.833 --> 24:33.266
any burden from the

24:33.700 --> 24:36.500
Seong-cheol Yun assassination or
taking part in the NSS attack

24:36.566 --> 24:38.100
with the terrorists,

24:39.233 --> 24:40.700
you may feel free from those.

24:59.066 --> 25:00.066
Hello, how do you do?

25:00.400 --> 25:03.400
Yes, looks like I owe my life
to you twice now.

25:04.933 --> 25:06.033
Please, have a seat.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.600
Um.

25:13.266 --> 25:17.233
We've gotten over a big hurdle,
but we have loads of homework to do.

25:20.133 --> 25:21.566
The incomplete Iris list

25:22.433 --> 25:24.533
you spoke of before.

25:25.533 --> 25:27.133
It's not easy to complete the list

25:28.133 --> 25:30.866
by identifying who's behind San Baek.

25:33.433 --> 25:35.866
I was hoping that you would
put an end to it.

25:37.966 --> 25:39.900
I am shameless to ask

25:40.266 --> 25:41.866
you who's been through so much,

25:43.566 --> 25:45.766
but if we can't find
the true identity of Iris,

25:46.433 --> 25:48.300
everything I've planned and prepared

25:50.133 --> 25:51.700
could go down the drain.

25:54.833 --> 25:55.900
Currently,

25:56.933 --> 25:59.700
you are the closest person
to the organization I know.

26:01.066 --> 26:02.033
Please.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.266
I have a request.

26:09.966 --> 26:10.866
What is it?

26:11.733 --> 26:13.200
Tell me anything you want.

26:16.466 --> 26:18.666
THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

26:47.833 --> 26:48.766
Please sit.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.066
If you need my help,

27:03.833 --> 27:05.666
press the button on the bottom left.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.633
You probably have lots to say.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.700
Don't hold back, and go on.

27:21.466 --> 27:22.566
Should I start?

27:26.800 --> 27:29.233
You've probably met
Professor Jeong-hoon Yoo,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.100
and opened my storage at the NSS archive.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.400
You probably know a fair bit about me.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.833
As you already know,

27:42.500 --> 27:43.933
I killed your parents.

27:48.900 --> 27:51.300
I didn't even know why I had to kill them,

27:51.766 --> 27:54.000
I was just following the orders.

27:54.566 --> 27:55.900
Was the order from Iris?

27:56.066 --> 27:57.300
Ultimately, it was.

27:58.066 --> 28:01.200
At the time, I didn't know what Iris was.

28:02.066 --> 28:04.900
Just as you killed Seong-cheol Yun
based on my order,

28:06.266 --> 28:08.600
I also thought it was an order
from the country,

28:09.233 --> 28:11.333
and the NSS.

28:12.300 --> 28:13.333
But you see,

28:15.500 --> 28:16.833
the order I received

28:18.433 --> 28:20.000
was to kill you too.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.566
I ignored that order

28:26.066 --> 28:27.233
and kept you alive.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.233
Why is that?

28:31.100 --> 28:32.466
Why did you keep me alive?

28:34.766 --> 28:38.633
Well, throughout life,
sometimes you want to do things

28:39.066 --> 28:40.933
with no particular reason, no?

28:42.366 --> 28:43.633
Your life.

28:45.666 --> 28:47.766
It was built as I designed it.

28:51.266 --> 28:53.633
It was me who got you this far,

28:54.733 --> 28:56.800
you, who should have died

28:58.766 --> 29:00.066
long time ago.

29:03.766 --> 29:05.066
Why did you abandon me

29:07.066 --> 29:08.366
after raising me all this time?

29:12.633 --> 29:13.600
That's like asking me

29:14.600 --> 29:15.700
to tell you

29:16.466 --> 29:19.900
the meaning of the organization
I am part of.

29:21.633 --> 29:24.600
It's a secret I need to take

29:25.866 --> 29:26.900
to my grave.

29:29.666 --> 29:30.600
Tell me!

29:33.100 --> 29:35.133
Why did you select me and got rid of me?

29:35.766 --> 29:36.833
Tell me!

29:38.866 --> 29:39.766
Take him.

29:42.066 --> 29:44.466
Ah... I'll tell you one thing.

29:47.633 --> 29:49.766
You've been punished because

29:51.333 --> 29:52.766
you've eaten the forbidden fruit.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.033
The life I constructed for you

29:55.833 --> 29:57.433
didn't involve any of that.

30:09.266 --> 30:10.766
With your current emotional status,

30:11.233 --> 30:13.200
I don't think you can meet
with Sa-woo Jin.

30:13.533 --> 30:14.600
No, that's okay.

30:17.133 --> 30:18.166
I'm fine.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.200
-Bring Sa-woo Jin.
-Yes, sir.

30:52.766 --> 30:54.133
What is this?

30:54.333 --> 30:56.166
Hyun-jun Kim wanted to see you.

31:03.300 --> 31:04.433
I have nothing to say.

31:05.766 --> 31:07.033
-Let's go.
-Sa-woo.

31:21.500 --> 31:22.600
If our friendship was genuine

31:25.000 --> 31:27.333
even for a moment,

31:31.533 --> 31:33.466
do not make me more miserable.

31:38.066 --> 31:39.033
Please.

31:46.333 --> 31:47.333
I beg you.

32:46.166 --> 32:47.100
Get him seated.

32:52.633 --> 32:53.900
The interrogation so far.

33:07.266 --> 33:08.666
Year 1995.

33:09.166 --> 33:12.133
I remember it was
the Defense Security Command

33:12.866 --> 33:14.633
that identified and stopped the coup

33:15.633 --> 33:17.533
started by the 6th Division.

33:18.900 --> 33:19.900
I also know

33:20.600 --> 33:22.066
all of it was the work of vice-marshal

33:23.033 --> 33:25.366
Tae-joon Rhee, the captain
of the Defense Security Command.

33:25.966 --> 33:27.700
But this recent coup...

33:29.800 --> 33:32.900
was not noticed by anyone until
the last minute.

33:35.766 --> 33:37.566
Why do you think that is?

33:37.966 --> 33:41.866
Wasn't it because the Vice-marshal
Tae-joon Rhee

33:42.233 --> 33:45.266
and Commissioner Gi-hoon Yeon
were the core of the entire coup?

33:47.266 --> 33:49.233
I'll ask you directly.

33:49.900 --> 33:50.966
Are you

33:51.600 --> 33:52.900
part of Iris?

33:53.700 --> 33:54.966
As I said before,

33:56.600 --> 33:58.533
I don't even know what that is.

34:07.766 --> 34:09.100
I will ask again.

34:09.733 --> 34:13.533
Who else is taking orders from Iris
in North Korea?

34:14.233 --> 34:15.833
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.766
The way you shudder,

34:29.933 --> 34:32.000
makes me think of a wet puppy.

34:33.033 --> 34:34.733
You'll die soon one way or another.

34:36.766 --> 34:39.199
Isn't it a bit embarrassing
to be like this?

34:40.133 --> 34:41.133
You...

34:43.033 --> 34:44.533
If I were the vice-marshal,

34:45.566 --> 34:46.766
I would die with pride

34:48.566 --> 34:50.533
like a soldier.

34:54.766 --> 34:56.300
I will ask one last time.

34:57.833 --> 35:01.533
Who else is taking orders from Iris
in North Korea?

35:13.066 --> 35:14.400
What happened with Sun-hwa Kim?

35:15.733 --> 35:17.566
With special treatment from
the South's president,

35:17.866 --> 35:20.366
it looks like she'll be released shortly.

35:21.933 --> 35:22.933
When she comes back,

35:23.400 --> 35:25.000
she can't avoid punishment, no?

35:27.900 --> 35:29.066
We'll figure something out.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.566
Can we talk privately?

36:23.833 --> 36:25.066
We have to leave soon.

36:25.466 --> 36:26.466
Keep it short.

36:33.466 --> 36:34.666
You could have stayed here,

36:36.866 --> 36:38.766
or chosen a different country.

36:39.566 --> 36:40.666
I know you asked

36:41.766 --> 36:44.333
the President for me too.

36:46.433 --> 36:47.366
But...

36:49.666 --> 36:50.866
I'm going back.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.066
You have no one there.

36:54.833 --> 36:57.166
No mom, no sister.

37:01.566 --> 37:03.400
But that's the same here too.

37:09.066 --> 37:10.633
It feels like yesterday,

37:11.400 --> 37:13.066
when I was chasing after you

37:14.833 --> 37:16.700
in the snowstorm in Akita.

37:18.366 --> 37:19.366
I'll never

37:20.333 --> 37:21.700
forget the taste of

37:22.866 --> 37:24.866
the butter coffee you made me in the hut

37:32.266 --> 37:33.666
in the woods that day.

37:39.766 --> 37:40.866
Can I...

37:43.600 --> 37:44.866
ask you...

37:46.233 --> 37:47.333
something?

37:49.700 --> 37:50.866
Come to think of it,

37:53.166 --> 37:54.466
you've never once

37:57.166 --> 37:58.333
called me

38:00.066 --> 38:01.700
by my name.

38:22.333 --> 38:23.500
If it wasn't for you

38:25.066 --> 38:26.366
I wouldn't have made it this far.

38:27.966 --> 38:29.133
Thanks for standing by my side.

38:32.666 --> 38:33.600
Sun-hwa.

39:11.966 --> 39:12.900
Let's go.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.266
He's the last chance for you to live.

41:04.066 --> 41:05.466
He's in Japan.

41:06.066 --> 41:07.266
Go seize the chance.

41:13.400 --> 41:14.866
Why are you doing this to me?

41:16.166 --> 41:17.600
I'm here to kill you.

41:18.766 --> 41:20.066
But...

41:21.333 --> 41:22.533
why...

41:23.200 --> 41:24.300
What about you?

41:26.233 --> 41:27.400
What drives you?

41:53.533 --> 41:55.266
Don't sacrifice for me anymore.

42:07.500 --> 42:08.400
Now...

42:09.233 --> 42:10.433
you may leave.

42:13.500 --> 42:14.633
Your parents,

42:15.166 --> 42:18.066
after cremation, their ashes were taken
to the North Han River.

42:18.900 --> 42:21.433
There will be a place.

42:22.233 --> 42:23.266
Director Baek

42:23.833 --> 42:25.566
has asked to pass this to you.

42:38.100 --> 42:39.133
Sir.

42:41.233 --> 42:43.433
Is something wrong?
You weren't at the meeting.

42:46.500 --> 42:47.866
You're really odd today.

42:48.866 --> 42:49.833
What's wrong?

42:52.700 --> 42:53.700
Hey, Mi-jeong.

42:53.900 --> 42:56.033
The temporary director or whatever,

42:56.100 --> 42:58.333
I can't work with him.

42:59.033 --> 43:00.766
Telling me I can't do this,
I can't do that.

43:01.166 --> 43:02.733
All he says is I can't do anything!

43:04.033 --> 43:05.366
What is he not letting you to do?

43:05.433 --> 43:07.566
My stock trade, you know?

43:07.800 --> 43:08.633
Hey,

43:09.200 --> 43:12.066
he completely shut down
my connection, you see?

43:12.666 --> 43:14.400
I mean, you know how much,

43:14.466 --> 43:17.166
how much I'm losing right now?

43:19.800 --> 43:21.333
Just give me the analysis results.

43:23.466 --> 43:24.400
Oh!

43:25.200 --> 43:26.200
Hey, Mi-jeong,

43:26.900 --> 43:29.766
You can remove the block
on the server, right?

43:30.166 --> 43:31.266
No, I can't!

43:31.700 --> 43:34.400
I'm never going to do any
unapproved tasks.

43:34.466 --> 43:35.733
Hey, Mi-jeong, Mi-jeong!

43:35.800 --> 43:37.100
Hey, please, just once. Please?

43:37.266 --> 43:38.566
-Please? Please?
-I don't want to.

43:38.633 --> 43:40.200
-Come on, just once.
-No.

43:40.300 --> 43:41.933
-Hey, Mi-jeong.
-No, I don't want to!

43:42.100 --> 43:44.066
Please, gorgeous, please?

43:46.866 --> 43:47.933
Hey!

43:48.366 --> 43:49.300
Hey you!

43:50.333 --> 43:51.866
You're alive, huh?

43:51.933 --> 43:52.766
How have you been?

43:52.833 --> 43:54.433
I've been well, of course.

43:54.500 --> 43:55.600
Same old.

43:56.266 --> 43:57.400
How have you been?

43:57.766 --> 43:58.700
Yes...

43:58.766 --> 43:59.666
You!

44:00.066 --> 44:01.533
I knew from the moment I saw you

44:01.600 --> 44:03.366
that you weren't meant to live
an easy life,

44:03.633 --> 44:05.966
but I honestly didn't know

44:06.066 --> 44:08.600
it was going to be this dramatic, hey?

44:16.533 --> 44:17.500
He's here!

44:18.366 --> 44:19.566
Hyun-jun is here!

44:19.866 --> 44:21.966
Ta-da!

44:23.533 --> 44:24.433
Sir!

44:26.433 --> 44:28.400
-How have you been?
-Welcome.

44:28.833 --> 44:31.433
Well, I'll leave you to it,
since I'm so busy.

44:38.166 --> 44:40.333
You can catch up with them later.

44:40.766 --> 44:42.066
Let's go see the director first.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.266
How can a NSS agent be so bad at

45:01.933 --> 45:03.700
controlling her facial expressions?

45:04.566 --> 45:05.666
What?

45:05.800 --> 45:07.300
It's all on your face.

45:07.533 --> 45:09.466
"I love you, Hyun-jun Kim!"

45:11.266 --> 45:14.200
Anyway, it's been a while
since I've seen your happy face.

45:28.900 --> 45:29.933
Hello.

45:30.533 --> 45:31.666
I don't know why

45:31.866 --> 45:34.766
the President has granted
a special pardon for you,

45:36.166 --> 45:37.133
but I honestly

45:37.833 --> 45:39.800
don't understand your profile.

45:40.766 --> 45:41.733
If you intend to

45:42.266 --> 45:44.133
return to the NSS,

45:45.000 --> 45:46.200
I will not accept it.

45:46.266 --> 45:47.166
Hyun-jun Kim

45:47.633 --> 45:49.366
was the best agent in the NSS.

45:50.133 --> 45:51.100
Plus, during the attack--

45:51.166 --> 45:52.333
Whatever the reason,

45:53.066 --> 45:54.466
isn't it true

45:54.600 --> 45:56.033
you were part of the terrorist attack?

45:57.000 --> 45:59.600
Please reconsider on that issue.

46:08.400 --> 46:09.533
Oh boy.

46:11.733 --> 46:13.966
That man, he is always negative.

46:15.366 --> 46:17.100
Everyone's having a tough time
because of him.

46:17.533 --> 46:18.533
I hope you can understand.

46:20.433 --> 46:21.966
I also have a ton of questions,

46:22.700 --> 46:24.000
and have a lot to say to you,

46:24.166 --> 46:25.666
but let's catch up later.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
You need to rest first.

46:28.066 --> 46:29.866
I'll let everyone else know too.

46:30.566 --> 46:31.466
Okay.

46:34.200 --> 46:35.100
Sir.

46:35.466 --> 46:38.066
Do you know where our
video surveillance blind spots are?

46:39.333 --> 46:40.266
No, why?

46:41.566 --> 46:43.766
I think Hyun-jun Kim knows where they are.

46:44.933 --> 46:46.600
Ms. Choi wants you there.

46:47.033 --> 46:48.200
Hey, you two,

46:48.766 --> 46:49.733
what are you up to?

46:50.466 --> 46:51.800
I have no idea.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.300
There's no need to worry about that.

47:04.266 --> 47:07.633
This is the only place in the NSS
where there are no cameras.

47:07.700 --> 47:08.700
Oh!

47:10.033 --> 47:11.600
I see...

47:12.166 --> 47:13.100
Is there...

47:13.600 --> 47:15.666
anything you want to
secretly talk to me about?

47:16.866 --> 47:17.966
Hyun-jun Kim.

47:19.166 --> 47:20.266
Do I look easy to you?

47:22.233 --> 47:24.800
If not, do you think the NSS is a joke?

47:26.933 --> 47:28.466
Keep in mind that I'm your superior,

47:29.233 --> 47:32.933
and the NSS never allows
romantic relationships to develop

47:34.166 --> 47:35.200
between agents.

47:36.266 --> 47:38.100
Do you know why I joined the NSS?

47:41.266 --> 47:42.966
I've decided to join the NSS

47:44.766 --> 47:46.833
because this dangerous
and complicated organization

47:47.433 --> 47:48.966
seemed very simple to me.

47:50.266 --> 47:51.400
If I just risk my life,

47:51.733 --> 47:55.000
I thought I could keep the job
that I find interesting

47:55.066 --> 47:57.266
and that I think I'm meant for.

48:00.133 --> 48:03.533
I've never thought
that you're an easy person

48:04.500 --> 48:06.633
ever since we first met in the classroom.

48:07.433 --> 48:11.300
And I'm serious about this.

48:23.233 --> 48:25.300
Is there anything you want to
secretly talk to me about?

48:28.933 --> 48:30.166
What were you thinking?

48:31.133 --> 48:32.133
Before...

48:33.233 --> 48:36.000
when I brought you here
for the first time.

48:37.500 --> 48:39.333
"I've decided to join the NSS

48:40.133 --> 48:41.966
because this dangerous
and complicated organization

48:42.300 --> 48:44.366
seemed very simple to me."

48:45.033 --> 48:46.533
"If I just risk my life,

48:47.233 --> 48:48.400
I thought I could keep the job

48:49.200 --> 48:50.700
that I find interesting

48:50.766 --> 48:52.733
and that I think I'm meant for."

48:53.400 --> 48:56.366
You told me this then.

48:57.433 --> 48:58.466
Remember?

49:00.533 --> 49:01.466
Yes.

49:01.633 --> 49:02.766
Is it still true?

49:05.500 --> 49:06.433
I'm not sure.

49:10.766 --> 49:12.133
Forget what I said.

49:13.033 --> 49:15.300
I heard you were interrogated at the NIS.

49:18.900 --> 49:21.933
Let's have you rest first. You look tired.

49:50.333 --> 49:52.300
My place is a mess today.

50:14.866 --> 50:17.866
Why are you just standing there awkwardly,
it's not like it's your first time here.

50:18.633 --> 50:19.833
Let's have dinner first.

50:20.466 --> 50:21.433
What should I make?

50:22.466 --> 50:24.166
I can make zucchini pancakes,

50:25.000 --> 50:26.200
and bean paste stew.

50:26.933 --> 50:28.233
I also have seaweed,

50:28.666 --> 50:29.666
oh, steamed eggs...

50:41.866 --> 50:43.433
I never thought

50:45.600 --> 50:46.866
I would have time like this again.

50:52.133 --> 50:53.833
So I'm always nervous as if it's a dream

50:56.300 --> 50:57.366
I'm about to wake up from.

51:12.000 --> 51:12.966
Dreams...

51:13.900 --> 51:16.566
are the times you've been through.

51:17.433 --> 51:18.766
This moment is

51:20.033 --> 51:21.366
the reality no matter what.

51:22.433 --> 51:24.433
It'll never go away, so relax.

51:59.200 --> 52:00.466
Hyun-jun, the food's done.

52:12.600 --> 52:13.533
Hyun-jun.

52:16.500 --> 52:17.400
Hyun-jun.

52:57.866 --> 52:59.566
You really won't tell me
what happened to you?

53:06.866 --> 53:08.000
Forget it if you don't want to.

53:13.400 --> 53:14.766
What is it? Your wounds will open up.

53:30.833 --> 53:33.033
I have a favor to ask.

53:37.566 --> 53:39.866
What is it? Tell me.

53:49.366 --> 53:52.333
There's been no progress
on the investigation on San Baek.

53:53.300 --> 53:54.600
You haven't found

53:55.000 --> 53:56.633
any additional people involved?

53:57.600 --> 53:59.666
-No.
-What about the list of people

54:00.266 --> 54:01.466
from Hyun-jun Kim?

54:01.566 --> 54:04.166
They've already left the country.

54:04.833 --> 54:08.433
Looks like it's time to change
the direction of investigation.

54:09.366 --> 54:11.033
Anyone involved with San Baek

54:11.866 --> 54:14.100
can be detained
somewhere other than the NIS,

54:14.933 --> 54:17.500
and be interrogated further.

54:17.733 --> 54:18.866
Where do you have in mind

54:20.600 --> 54:22.366
when you say somewhere else?

54:25.600 --> 54:26.666
Well...

54:26.733 --> 54:29.366
we'll need to find a safe location
with good security.

54:30.566 --> 54:33.266
I heard the North Korean
operations team that left

54:33.733 --> 54:34.800
is coming back?

54:35.300 --> 54:38.533
Yes, for now... We're thinking of
rescheduling the summit discussion

54:39.566 --> 54:42.366
to sometime next mid-month.

54:42.466 --> 54:44.100
Please pay closer attention

54:44.766 --> 54:46.133
to make sure everything goes smoothly.

54:46.700 --> 54:47.700
Yes, sir.

55:00.366 --> 55:01.433
You look strange.

55:02.333 --> 55:03.366
Huh? What?

55:04.233 --> 55:06.033
You look like you're on the run.

55:06.633 --> 55:07.633
What's going on?

55:09.566 --> 55:10.833
Nothing...

55:37.266 --> 55:39.266
-Sir!
-Hmm? Oh!

55:40.266 --> 55:41.300
Oh...

55:41.733 --> 55:43.600
I'll unlock the blocked server.

55:43.933 --> 55:45.633
What did you say? Really?

55:47.566 --> 55:49.733
Well, if you can do that for me,

55:49.966 --> 55:51.500
I'll give you a very

55:51.633 --> 55:53.533
very lucrative information, okay?

55:53.933 --> 55:56.566
I'll help you make money.

55:58.900 --> 56:00.066
I'm not interested in that,

56:00.500 --> 56:02.333
but can you give me the key
to the server room?

56:02.666 --> 56:03.533
What for?

56:04.366 --> 56:05.933
I can't go in there.

56:06.366 --> 56:08.700
Ah ha... Right, right.

56:12.233 --> 56:13.266
Um...

56:20.833 --> 56:23.800
Let's keep this a secret between us.

56:25.166 --> 56:27.933
Um...

56:28.266 --> 56:29.166
Okay.

57:12.366 --> 57:13.300
We received

57:13.533 --> 57:16.733
a transfer plan for Director Baek
and Sa-woo Jin from the NIS,

57:17.466 --> 57:18.500
but this transfer

57:18.866 --> 57:20.066
is classified,

57:20.633 --> 57:21.966
so keep it only to yourself.

57:22.566 --> 57:23.566
Yes, sir.

57:24.400 --> 57:27.166
Is there anything we need to do?

57:27.366 --> 57:28.733
Until the transfer is complete,

57:29.466 --> 57:31.500
the NSS will not take a part.

57:31.866 --> 57:32.766
Right,

57:33.566 --> 57:34.833
where is Hyun-jun Kim?

57:35.233 --> 57:36.800
Why are you looking for him?

57:37.300 --> 57:38.500
The Blue House has requested

57:39.233 --> 57:40.766
him to be involved in interrogation

57:41.166 --> 57:42.766
after the inmate transfer.

57:43.466 --> 57:44.866
That may be a little difficult.

57:45.700 --> 57:48.766
It may be good to let him rest for a bit.

57:49.600 --> 57:51.466
I wasn't enthusiastic about it anyway.

57:52.100 --> 57:53.333
Let him rest then.

58:34.066 --> 58:35.500
Oh? When did you wake up?

58:41.866 --> 58:42.866
Just now.

58:43.633 --> 58:45.166
Do you know how many hours you slept?

58:45.700 --> 58:46.600
No.

58:47.533 --> 58:49.633
You slept 33 hours.

58:50.633 --> 58:53.100
I tried to wake you up
because I thought something was wrong.

58:53.366 --> 58:54.766
But you wouldn't even move.

58:56.466 --> 58:57.500
Aren't you hungry?

58:59.900 --> 59:01.366
I am, very.

59:01.966 --> 59:04.266
Wait and I'll make you something good.

59:06.200 --> 59:08.266
Anyway, how can you sleep for that long?

59:11.066 --> 59:12.833
Maybe it's because
I didn't have any nightmares.

59:13.833 --> 59:15.200
Since I left Hungary,

59:16.866 --> 59:18.933
it's been difficult to sleep for
more than two hours.

59:19.933 --> 59:21.000
Even when I do sleep,

59:22.033 --> 59:24.300
I'd always have nightmares.

59:26.100 --> 59:27.633
Consider it my deed.

59:29.166 --> 59:31.066
I prayed you wouldn't have nightmares.

59:37.766 --> 59:39.933
I'm on vacation today.
Should we go on a trip?

59:44.266 --> 59:45.300
Where to?

59:45.966 --> 59:48.433
Um... Anywhere you can rest

59:48.566 --> 59:49.833
would be nice.

59:51.366 --> 59:54.233
Before we go, I have somewhere to visit.

59:54.600 --> 59:55.566
Where?

1:00:02.466 --> 1:00:03.700
I've been waiting.

1:00:04.766 --> 1:00:06.733
Huh, what is all this?

1:00:07.500 --> 1:00:08.766
In return for doing me

1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:10.866
a favor.

1:00:13.900 --> 1:00:14.833
Sit.

1:00:15.733 --> 1:00:16.766
Okay.

1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:51.566
Your parents' ashes,

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.033
after cremation,

1:00:53.300 --> 1:00:55.033
were taken to the North Han River.

1:01:04.933 --> 1:01:05.800
What's your name?

1:01:06.066 --> 1:01:07.000
Hyun-jun Kim.

1:01:29.900 --> 1:01:30.933
The...

1:01:32.466 --> 1:01:33.633
thing I asked you about...

1:01:34.166 --> 1:01:36.566
Oh that, I set it up
so you could see it on my PC.

1:01:40.133 --> 1:01:41.233
Here's the access code.

1:01:51.866 --> 1:01:52.866
Thanks.

1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:29.933
Mom!

1:03:10.300 --> 1:03:12.933
You were released after
a phone call from someone.

1:03:13.433 --> 1:03:16.233
Aren't you curious why you were
released with no harm?

1:03:17.566 --> 1:03:18.700
I don't want to go back

1:03:18.900 --> 1:03:20.433
to South Korea ever again.

1:03:20.866 --> 1:03:21.800
Hyun-jun Kim...

1:03:22.366 --> 1:03:23.666
Is it because of him?

1:03:38.666 --> 1:03:40.433
The helicopter is waiting.

1:03:40.933 --> 1:03:41.933
You must come

1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:43.133
with me.
