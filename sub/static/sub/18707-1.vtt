01:51.350 --> 01:53.649
Do you, Angela Nardino...

01:53.650 --> 01:56.950
take Dean Cumanno as your
lawfully wedded husband...

01:57.050 --> 02:00.949
to love, honor, and obey
till death do you part?

02:00.950 --> 02:01.950
I do.

02:03.451 --> 02:08.451
Out of the tree of life,
I just picked me a plum

02:12.051 --> 02:16.951
You came along,
and everything started to hum

02:22.451 --> 02:24.250
You happy, Baby?

02:24.252 --> 02:27.151
I am so happy.
It's beautiful, Dean.

02:27.152 --> 02:28.751
It's everything
I ever wanted.

02:28.752 --> 02:30.252
Yeah?

02:30.352 --> 02:33.551
Like the song says,
"The best is yet to come."

02:33.552 --> 02:36.551
The honeymoon.

02:36.552 --> 02:40.652
Oh, you got a little
bit of cake right...

02:46.053 --> 02:49.652
I think we've put in enough of
an appearance here, don't you?

02:49.653 --> 02:51.053
Come on, let's go.

02:52.153 --> 02:54.652
I believe it's tradition
for the best man to dance...

02:54.653 --> 02:55.952
with the beautiful bride.

02:55.953 --> 02:56.952
Piss off, Leo.

02:56.953 --> 02:59.953
Dean, you can't be
rude to your friends.

03:00.053 --> 03:01.953
I'd love to dance with you.

03:04.453 --> 03:09.553
The best is yet to come,
come the day you're mine

03:11.054 --> 03:15.854
Come fly with me,
let's fly, let's fly away

03:17.954 --> 03:20.853
Just say the words,
and we'll beat the birds

03:20.854 --> 03:25.254
Down to Acapulco Bay

03:25.354 --> 03:30.354
It's perfect for
a flying honeymoon

03:30.455 --> 03:37.355
They say, come fly with me,
let's fly, let's fly away

03:37.455 --> 03:40.554
Congratulations, man.
She's great.

03:40.555 --> 03:41.954
I love your friends.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.455
That's the busboy, honey.

03:44.555 --> 03:45.954
Wow.

03:45.955 --> 03:48.854
You even got me great busboys.

03:48.856 --> 03:52.356
Now let's have one more
dance with the bride and groom.

03:52.456 --> 03:54.456
Oh! Ha, ha, ha!

03:57.756 --> 03:58.955
Are you still nervous?

03:58.956 --> 04:00.056
No.

04:00.156 --> 04:03.955
And thank you for respecting
my religious beliefs.

04:03.956 --> 04:07.755
- I'm really ready now.
- Thank you, God!

04:07.756 --> 04:09.155
I'm ready to do things to you...

04:09.157 --> 04:12.156
that no woman has
ever done before.

04:12.157 --> 04:13.657
How about a...

04:51.659 --> 04:53.158
Oh.

04:53.159 --> 04:54.158
Here it is.

04:54.159 --> 04:56.259
Oh, it's so...

04:56.359 --> 04:58.359
tasteful.

05:49.861 --> 05:50.860
Oh, my God.

05:50.861 --> 05:54.461
That's how much
I love you, baby.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.662
You must love me...

05:56.762 --> 05:57.762
a lot.

06:12.662 --> 06:14.162
Take me, Dean.

06:18.763 --> 06:20.162
Don't tease me.

06:20.163 --> 06:22.162
I'm not...

06:22.163 --> 06:28.263
Not a big fan
of this material.

06:28.363 --> 06:30.063
Oh.

07:09.565 --> 07:10.565
Angela?

07:12.965 --> 07:14.764
Angela!

07:14.765 --> 07:16.664
Oh, no.

07:16.665 --> 07:18.465
Don't do this to me, Angela.

08:01.268 --> 08:02.668
Welcome back.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.167
Oh, my God.

08:08.168 --> 08:10.168
What happened?

08:10.268 --> 08:12.267
Not a whole hell of a lot.

08:12.268 --> 08:15.267
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

08:15.268 --> 08:16.468
Our wedding night?

08:18.168 --> 08:20.167
Oh, I am a bad wife.

08:20.168 --> 08:21.168
No.

08:21.269 --> 08:23.868
No, no, no.

08:23.869 --> 08:26.869
I do got some frostbite
in some very weird places.

08:26.969 --> 08:28.268
Oh--

08:28.269 --> 08:32.268
You've got your whole
life to make it up to me.

08:32.269 --> 08:34.868
And I'm going
to start right now.

08:34.869 --> 08:36.769
Yeah? OK.

08:39.169 --> 08:40.568
Oh!

08:40.569 --> 08:42.569
Ohhh!

08:42.670 --> 08:45.270
Oh, my God,
I'm going to be sick.

08:50.770 --> 08:52.669
Just give me a minute, baby.
I'll be right back.

08:52.670 --> 08:54.669
No, no, no.
There's no rush.

08:54.670 --> 08:55.669
No rush.

08:55.670 --> 08:57.470
Look, I got to stop
by the office...

08:57.570 --> 08:59.569
before we leave
for Barbados any way.

08:59.570 --> 09:02.169
That'll give you some
time to freshen up.

09:02.170 --> 09:03.969
Let me give you
a quick kiss good-bye.

09:03.971 --> 09:06.070
No! No, no, no.
That's OK, that's OK.

09:06.071 --> 09:07.470
I--I'm late.

09:07.471 --> 09:10.171
I'll see you in
an hour, maybe two.

09:20.271 --> 09:23.071
Here. Put it
over here on the rack.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.571
Hey! What the--?

09:43.572 --> 09:46.072
- Nice security.
- Sorry, boss.

09:46.173 --> 09:49.172
I--I went to bed
late last night.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.072
But nothing
compared to you, huh?

09:51.073 --> 09:52.772
Yeah. Is the Mercedes ready?

09:52.773 --> 09:54.673
Yeah, yeah, just about.

09:54.773 --> 09:57.073
We switched the VIN,
and Wendy's making...

09:57.173 --> 09:58.872
the pink slip for
you to sign up there.

09:58.873 --> 09:59.872
All right.

09:59.873 --> 10:01.973
That's a great
wedding present, boss.

10:02.073 --> 10:04.872
Angela's going to go
nuts for it, huh?

10:04.873 --> 10:07.272
Maybe not as nuts as
she went last night, huh?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.273
Huh?

10:08.274 --> 10:09.874
Hey, boss, was
she worth the wait?

10:09.974 --> 10:10.874
Come on--

10:10.974 --> 10:11.973
Hey, hey, hey!

10:11.974 --> 10:14.874
We're talking
about my wife here.

10:14.974 --> 10:18.574
A man's wedding night is his
own private, sacred business.

10:18.674 --> 10:21.674
It's not to entertain
lowlife scum like youse guys.

10:25.174 --> 10:27.674
Angela's got
to be an animal.

10:27.775 --> 10:29.575
Hey, he's even
walking funny, huh?

10:31.175 --> 10:32.374
Hey, back to work, all right.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.875
The break is over,
guys, come on.

10:43.975 --> 10:46.375
Oh! Congratulations, Mr. C.

10:49.476 --> 10:51.275
I heard the wedding
was awesome.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.775
I'm almost through with
the docs on the Mercedes.

10:53.776 --> 10:55.276
Oh, thanks, Wendy.

11:02.176 --> 11:03.876
Oh, boy.

11:03.976 --> 11:04.976
Oh, boy.

11:13.977 --> 11:17.377
You need to sign
here and I think...

11:19.277 --> 11:20.277
here.

11:22.477 --> 11:24.777
Is it hard?

11:24.877 --> 11:25.876
What?

11:25.877 --> 11:26.976
Getting married.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.376
I mean, I haven't
been here that long...

11:28.377 --> 11:29.577
but I've already
heard tons of stories...

11:29.677 --> 11:30.676
about you and women.

11:30.677 --> 11:31.676
Yeah, well.

11:31.678 --> 11:33.678
Those days are all over, Wendy.

11:35.178 --> 11:36.178
Forever.

11:37.578 --> 11:38.578
Thank you.

11:42.478 --> 11:43.478
Ah, damn it.

11:50.378 --> 11:52.178
Here. Let me help you.

12:03.679 --> 12:04.678
Mr. Cumanno.

12:04.679 --> 12:05.678
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Wendy.

12:05.679 --> 12:09.479
I--I'm so sorry,
I'm just nuts today.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.580
I can't,
I can't, I can't.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.580
I'm married, Wendy...

12:16.680 --> 12:17.580
I'm married.
I can't.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.980
You're right.
I'm sorry.

12:19.080 --> 12:19.980
I'm sorry.

12:22.180 --> 12:23.180
Screw it.

12:33.380 --> 12:38.179
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. OK, OK.

12:38.181 --> 12:39.180
Oh, my God.

12:39.181 --> 12:40.180
Thanks.

12:40.181 --> 12:41.180
Is that frostbite?

12:41.181 --> 12:43.180
I'm fine. It's fine.

12:43.181 --> 12:44.480
Piss off,
I'm working here.

12:44.481 --> 12:45.881
Baby, it's me.

12:47.781 --> 12:49.781
Shit. Get out.
Take the back stairs.

12:49.881 --> 12:51.381
I can't.
My hair is stuck.

12:51.481 --> 12:52.481
What?

12:53.681 --> 12:55.580
- Dean.
- Honey.

12:55.582 --> 12:59.281
Ahh, ha, hi.

12:59.282 --> 13:00.582
I was feeling
so much better...

13:00.682 --> 13:01.582
I couldn't
wait to pick up...

13:01.682 --> 13:03.081
where we left off.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.082
Oh, that's great.
That's great.

13:04.182 --> 13:05.082
You know what?

13:05.182 --> 13:06.681
I'm just going
to finish up here.

13:06.682 --> 13:08.882
I'll meet you outside
in a sex--a sec.

13:08.982 --> 13:10.382
OK.

13:10.482 --> 13:11.382
I love you.

13:11.482 --> 13:13.681
Oh.

13:13.682 --> 13:15.282
I love you, too.

13:17.383 --> 13:18.483
You look pretty.

13:21.883 --> 13:22.983
Come on.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.083
Come on. Ow.

13:24.183 --> 13:25.382
Get out.
Not so fast.

13:25.383 --> 13:26.383
You are not
welcome down there.

13:26.483 --> 13:27.482
Get up.
I'm trying.

13:27.483 --> 13:30.383
I can't
believe that Mercedes...

13:33.183 --> 13:34.782
Dean.

13:34.783 --> 13:36.382
Honey, honey, this
isn't what it looks like.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.483
I--I swear her hair
got stuck in my zipper.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.384
I--I--I wasn't getting nothing.

13:40.484 --> 13:43.484
17 hours we have
been married.

13:43.584 --> 13:45.384
17 hours!

13:45.484 --> 13:47.483
The happiest
17 hours of my life.

13:47.484 --> 13:50.784
You just lost the best
thing you'd ever had.

13:52.984 --> 13:54.384
Angela, wait.

13:57.484 --> 13:59.283
She seems...

13:59.285 --> 14:00.285
nice.

14:01.085 --> 14:04.085
My client has agreed,
against my advice...

14:04.185 --> 14:07.685
to settle for
a one-time cash payment.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.784
$300, 000.

14:14.785 --> 14:16.584
For one day?

14:16.585 --> 14:20.484
One horribly traumatic day
in which my client suffered...

14:20.486 --> 14:24.086
irreparable psychological
damage to her self-esteem.

14:24.186 --> 14:26.586
Oh, and she keeps
the Mercedes.

14:26.686 --> 14:28.085
What?

14:28.086 --> 14:30.485
Bullshit.

14:30.486 --> 14:32.486
Well, we could drag this
before a judge...

14:32.586 --> 14:35.485
if you think that
would be more favorable.

14:35.486 --> 14:39.186
That would put your client's
business under scrutiny.

14:39.286 --> 14:41.185
What was it again, Mr. Cumanno?

14:41.187 --> 14:43.087
Random repossessions?

14:47.087 --> 14:48.787
Give her what she wants.

15:37.589 --> 15:39.788
I can't believe you
wore the gray dress.

15:39.789 --> 15:41.389
I distinctly said the blue.

15:41.489 --> 15:44.089
- It worked, didn't it?
- You were lucky.

15:44.190 --> 15:45.990
I was good.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.490
Excuse me.

15:59.590 --> 16:02.689
I wonder if I could ask
your help for a moment.

16:02.690 --> 16:06.690
I'm trying to find Route 40.

16:06.791 --> 16:08.691
Route 40?
Well, you're on it.

16:08.791 --> 16:10.090
That's it.

16:10.091 --> 16:11.191
What?
Where is it?

16:11.291 --> 16:12.590
There. See that black thing...

16:12.591 --> 16:14.190
with the lines on it,
the cars going?

16:14.191 --> 16:15.390
I'm so embarrassed.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.591
I'm so sorry.

16:16.691 --> 16:18.391
I didn't know
where it was.

16:18.491 --> 16:19.391
Thank you so much.

16:19.491 --> 16:20.391
My pleasure.

16:20.491 --> 16:21.391
Sorry to trouble you.

16:21.491 --> 16:22.491
It's OK.

16:27.492 --> 16:28.491
Forget it.

16:28.492 --> 16:29.591
You're not going
to kill yourself...

16:29.592 --> 16:31.591
and stink up my new car.

16:31.592 --> 16:32.792
Our new car.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.091
Hey! Mom.

16:36.092 --> 16:38.692
I only do these things
because I love you, Page.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.591
How was the wedding?

16:43.592 --> 16:44.892
Beautiful.

16:44.992 --> 16:46.692
Like all my weddings.

16:56.193 --> 16:57.693
Have you any idea
what that meat...

16:57.793 --> 16:59.293
is doing to your arteries?

16:59.393 --> 17:00.792
Haven't you heard?

17:00.793 --> 17:02.693
Cigarettes
dissolve cholesterol.

17:07.993 --> 17:09.292
No cards, Page.

17:09.294 --> 17:10.793
This is a classy place.

17:10.794 --> 17:12.094
It relaxes me.

17:14.394 --> 17:17.293
So? How did we do?

17:17.294 --> 17:18.993
Not too bad.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.994
How not too bad?

17:21.094 --> 17:22.494
About 80.

17:22.594 --> 17:23.594
Plus the car.

17:25.594 --> 17:27.093
That's it?

17:27.094 --> 17:30.693
For that I lived 4 months in
a crap hotel without cable?

17:30.695 --> 17:33.295
Ugh, I'm so sick of this
small-time bullshit.

17:33.395 --> 17:35.394
Plus, I had to kiss
that greasy mook.

17:35.395 --> 17:36.894
Dean wasn't so bad.

17:36.895 --> 17:39.295
Any way, we'll make more
in the next one.

17:39.395 --> 17:41.694
I'm thinking Seattle.

17:41.695 --> 17:42.894
Maybe San Francisco.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.995
Mom, remember our deal?

17:45.095 --> 17:46.095
OK, there is no next one.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.295
This is it.
I'm going solo.

17:47.395 --> 17:48.395
Oh, here we go--

17:48.495 --> 17:50.894
It's happening, Mom.
Accept it, embrace it, OK?

17:50.896 --> 17:52.596
I am old enough
to be on my own.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.295
You have no idea what it's like
to be all alone.

17:55.296 --> 17:57.295
I'll tell you exactly
what's going to happen.

17:57.296 --> 17:59.396
You'll go off,
you'll get lonely.

17:59.496 --> 18:02.295
Some moron hunk will come along,
you'll think it's true love.

18:02.296 --> 18:04.995
You'd never been so sure
of anything in your life.

18:04.996 --> 18:05.995
And then, bam.

18:05.996 --> 18:07.496
He will pull a
conceive and leave...

18:07.596 --> 18:09.496
and then it's my
life all over again.

18:09.596 --> 18:11.396
Mom, I am not that stupid.

18:15.597 --> 18:17.096
You know what I mean.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.496
Well, you're right.
I was stupid.

18:19.497 --> 18:21.596
And it left me
pregnant and alone.

18:21.597 --> 18:23.696
If Barbara hadn't taken me in
and shown me the con--

18:23.697 --> 18:25.096
And you taught me.

18:25.097 --> 18:26.597
OK? I'll be fine.

18:28.497 --> 18:30.797
OK. Fine.

18:30.897 --> 18:31.796
If you've made up your mind...

18:31.797 --> 18:35.696
we will go to New York
and divide up everything.

18:35.698 --> 18:36.898
I'll get the check.

18:46.798 --> 18:49.897
Oh, my Lord!

18:49.898 --> 18:51.898
Eww.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.297
What seems to be
the problem, madam?

18:53.298 --> 18:55.297
Well, I was just about
to take a bite...

18:55.299 --> 18:57.898
and I saw glass. Look.

18:57.899 --> 19:01.599
I am so sorry, ma'am.
This has never happened.

19:01.699 --> 19:04.999
Of course your meal
is, uh, complimentary.

19:05.099 --> 19:07.398
Armando, a bottle
of wine, quickly.

19:07.399 --> 19:09.799
Perhaps a '69 Merlot.

19:20.300 --> 19:23.399
Those shoes
are so wrong for this.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.199
Thanks.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.400
I don't understand
the problem, Philip.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.799
We deposit our money...

19:28.800 --> 19:31.000
and you give it back
when we say so.

19:31.100 --> 19:34.200
I'm afraid it's not that
simple, Ms. Conners.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.000
Hello.
I'm Gloria Vogal.

19:40.001 --> 19:41.201
I.R.S.

19:44.201 --> 19:45.200
Hello.

19:45.201 --> 19:47.201
Oh, I see you've
heard of us.

19:47.301 --> 19:50.501
I'm surprised because
we so seldom hear from you.

19:50.601 --> 19:53.300
Well, I suppose
I might be a little late...

19:53.301 --> 19:54.701
with this year's return.

19:54.801 --> 19:56.701
Maybe even the last 7.

19:56.802 --> 19:59.701
Mother, I'm stunned.

19:59.702 --> 20:02.401
I had no idea you would
evade your responsibilities...

20:02.402 --> 20:03.401
as a U.S. Citizen.

20:03.402 --> 20:05.301
Shut up, Miss Conners.

20:05.302 --> 20:07.902
We've never seen
a dime from you, either.

20:08.002 --> 20:10.302
Look, I know
what must have happened.

20:10.402 --> 20:12.901
You see, I always
assumed that my returns...

20:12.902 --> 20:15.101
were filed by my husband.

20:15.102 --> 20:16.601
Oh...

20:16.602 --> 20:18.201
which one?

20:18.203 --> 20:20.402
Look, just because
I've had some trouble...

20:20.403 --> 20:21.702
with my personal
relationships--

20:21.703 --> 20:22.702
Ms. Conners...

20:22.703 --> 20:26.202
how you earn your money is
of no interest to the I.R.S.

20:26.203 --> 20:30.003
Now, how can I put this in
language you'll understand?

20:30.103 --> 20:32.103
We just want our cut.

20:32.203 --> 20:34.202
How much?

20:34.203 --> 20:40.202
With interest and penalties,
the total comes to $247, 811.

20:40.204 --> 20:41.204
What?

20:46.604 --> 20:50.203
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

20:50.204 --> 20:52.704
Ha ha! I'm afraid
that amount is in addition...

20:52.804 --> 20:55.004
to what used to be
in your accounts.

20:55.104 --> 20:58.103
Your latest divorce settlement
arrived this morning.

20:58.104 --> 21:00.204
Thanks.

21:00.305 --> 21:02.205
But that's everything.

21:02.305 --> 21:03.605
It's not all bad.

21:03.705 --> 21:06.505
We give you a full
90 days to pay.

21:06.605 --> 21:07.605
Or...

21:10.305 --> 21:12.205
we move for ward
with criminal charges...

21:12.305 --> 21:14.705
for felony tax
evasion and fraud.

21:18.505 --> 21:20.005
Good luck.

21:24.506 --> 21:26.205
Here's the last of our cash.

21:26.206 --> 21:29.206
1, 150...

21:29.306 --> 21:32.005
1, 170...

21:32.006 --> 21:34.405
1, 190.

21:34.406 --> 21:37.405
That's $1, 300 each.

21:37.406 --> 21:41.005
Wow. Have a nice life
with that, Princess.

21:41.006 --> 21:43.006
- I'll economize.
- Sure.

21:43.107 --> 21:45.907
You can do your own hair,
your own nails.

21:46.007 --> 21:49.007
They actually have some
great shoes at Wal-Mart.

21:50.407 --> 21:52.607
Ugh! All right.

21:52.707 --> 21:56.706
One more con,
but only if we do it right.

21:56.707 --> 21:57.706
What does that mean?

21:57.707 --> 21:59.906
It means no more
small-time crap.

21:59.907 --> 22:00.807
It has to be big.

22:00.907 --> 22:03.106
One big final score
to pay off the I.R.S...

22:03.108 --> 22:04.707
and set me up on my own.

22:04.708 --> 22:07.807
What are you talking about?

22:07.808 --> 22:09.507
Palm Beach.

22:09.508 --> 22:11.108
Palm Beach?

22:11.208 --> 22:12.307
Forget it.

22:12.308 --> 22:14.008
People that rich are
already suspicious.

22:14.108 --> 22:15.507
It's too hard to play.

22:15.508 --> 22:18.108
Palm Beach or nothing.

22:59.310 --> 23:00.509
Too expensive.

23:00.510 --> 23:02.009
Let's find something else.

23:02.010 --> 23:03.910
I am home.

23:13.011 --> 23:15.810
Now, what's the best way
to get a room?

23:15.811 --> 23:18.011
I was thinking
the Trogdon Triangle.

23:19.211 --> 23:21.310
Right. But where are
we going to find...

23:21.311 --> 23:23.411
a trumpet and a talking parrot?

23:23.511 --> 23:26.910
I was thinking of
something simple, traditional.

23:26.911 --> 23:29.011
The Flopper Diver.

23:29.112 --> 23:30.412
No way am I--

23:30.512 --> 23:31.712
Oh!

23:31.812 --> 23:32.911
Oh, my God.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.212
She's cracked
her head open.

23:35.312 --> 23:37.311
Oh, darling!
Oh, careful!

23:37.312 --> 23:39.811
You may be paralyzed.

23:39.812 --> 23:41.811
Call a doctor.

23:41.812 --> 23:44.011
But I'm--I'm sure
she'll be fine.

23:44.012 --> 23:45.012
I think I'm--

23:58.413 --> 24:03.613
Just please let me know if
there's anything else we can do.

24:03.713 --> 24:06.412
Well, you might consider
investing in a mop.

24:06.413 --> 24:09.212
Once again, I apologize.
Now, since we seem...

24:09.213 --> 24:11.612
to have lost your reservation...

24:11.614 --> 24:13.813
we can only let you have
this suite for one night.

24:13.814 --> 24:15.014
Aah!

24:17.114 --> 24:20.014
Uh, then I'm sure we
can work something out.

24:20.114 --> 24:22.613
Could everyone please
just let her rest now?

24:22.614 --> 24:23.914
Yeah. Hey!

24:33.915 --> 24:37.415
Don't you ever flop me
without my consent.

24:37.515 --> 24:39.614
Oh! It had to look
real, Sweetheart.

24:39.615 --> 24:41.315
You fall lousy when
you know it's coming.

24:41.415 --> 24:43.814
I fall fine!

24:43.815 --> 24:45.214
Fake.

24:45.215 --> 24:46.314
Oh, shut up!

24:46.315 --> 24:48.615
Hey! Oh, no!

24:48.715 --> 24:49.715
Cheat!

24:49.815 --> 24:52.115
No, stop!

24:52.216 --> 24:56.116
Hey, boss, just got
3 Camrys in--cherry.

24:56.216 --> 24:58.316
Parts will bring
100 thou easy.

24:58.416 --> 24:59.515
Great.

24:59.516 --> 25:01.315
And the change of
title came through...

25:01.316 --> 25:03.616
on the Mercedes.
You have to sign.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.816
That bitch.

25:11.216 --> 25:14.916
You know, this is,
like, the eighth frame...

25:15.017 --> 25:17.916
we've gone through
in a week.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.216
Maybe it's time
to retire this picture.

25:20.217 --> 25:23.116
Why the hell can't I stop
thinking about her?

25:23.117 --> 25:25.216
Was it the legs?

25:25.217 --> 25:26.817
She had amazing legs.

25:26.917 --> 25:28.217
Give me that!

25:31.017 --> 25:33.916
Or maybe it was
that she dumped you...

25:33.918 --> 25:36.118
'cause that's never
happened before.

25:37.118 --> 25:40.917
Yeah...yeah.

25:40.918 --> 25:43.217
Who the hell does
she think she is?

25:43.218 --> 25:45.617
She thinks she can do this
to me and just walk out?

25:45.618 --> 25:47.218
Well, she's wrong!

25:47.318 --> 25:48.618
I'm gonna find her.

25:49.818 --> 25:51.218
And then?

25:54.518 --> 25:56.518
Then I'm gonna take care of it.

26:08.019 --> 26:09.819
Dr. Arnold Davis.

26:09.919 --> 26:12.218
Made huge money
when an old uncle died...

26:12.219 --> 26:13.819
45, pretty good shape.

26:15.419 --> 26:17.219
Who's the old bag?

26:17.320 --> 26:19.120
His mom.
She lives with him.

26:20.820 --> 26:23.420
Forget it. He's taken.
Mama's boy.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.020
We can get around her.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.719
Pass. Mothers are death.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.120
Can't argue that.

26:53.921 --> 26:56.021
David D. Cummings...

26:56.121 --> 26:59.521
760 million.
E-commerce stuff...

26:59.622 --> 27:02.321
just ended
marriage number 3.

27:02.322 --> 27:03.821
Downside?

27:03.822 --> 27:06.221
Very big on ironclad prenups...

27:06.222 --> 27:09.521
and as you can see,
massive competition.

27:09.522 --> 27:11.522
We could handle him.

27:11.622 --> 27:14.621
We'd have to be into
a group kind of thing.

27:14.622 --> 27:15.822
Menage a trois?

27:17.322 --> 27:19.322
Try menage a cinq.

27:20.423 --> 27:23.023
Ew. Pass.

27:35.523 --> 27:38.423
Wow. William B. Tensy.

27:38.523 --> 27:39.723
C.E.O. of Tensy Tobacco.

27:39.823 --> 27:42.523
Old money, but also
just plain old.

27:50.924 --> 27:52.223
How much?

27:52.224 --> 27:54.623
3 billion with a few
million more every day.

27:54.624 --> 27:55.724
Hmm...

27:55.824 --> 27:58.423
Not "hmm." I am not
dating the walking dead.

27:58.424 --> 27:59.823
Page, the older the better.

27:59.824 --> 28:01.423
With luck they die
right after the wedding...

28:01.425 --> 28:03.125
and then you're
talking widow money.

28:07.025 --> 28:08.924
I'd have to kiss that?

28:08.925 --> 28:11.124
Well, I'd have to kiss
that way more than you.

28:11.125 --> 28:13.325
Well, maybe you're
into necrophilia.

28:17.525 --> 28:19.325
We'd better work fast.

28:24.126 --> 28:25.825
Why for once can't
we pick someone...

28:25.826 --> 28:27.625
who's just a little bit cute?

28:27.626 --> 28:29.026
Dean was kind of cute.

28:30.026 --> 28:32.326
You're in serious denial.

28:32.426 --> 28:33.726
Cute is dangerous.

28:33.826 --> 28:36.126
Cute leads to feeling,
which leads to screwing...

28:36.226 --> 28:37.526
which leads to screwed.

28:37.626 --> 28:40.825
I know that we can make that
doctor and his mom work for us.

28:40.826 --> 28:42.626
Page, we're going with
Tensy, and that's that.

28:42.726 --> 28:44.625
That is not that.

28:44.627 --> 28:46.927
Look, if you want to go
with Tensy, go with Tensy.

28:47.027 --> 28:48.327
I'm working Davis.

28:48.427 --> 28:51.826
Page, I've told you before,
no simultaneous cons.

28:51.827 --> 28:54.326
Too many angles.
They always go bad.

28:54.327 --> 28:56.626
Yeah, but it's not
just that, is it?

28:56.627 --> 28:57.726
What?

28:57.727 --> 29:00.626
You don't think I can be
the primary, do you?

29:00.627 --> 29:02.527
I didn't say that.

29:02.627 --> 29:05.427
Although it does take
an enormous amount of skill.

29:05.528 --> 29:09.328
I can make men do anything.

29:09.428 --> 29:12.128
Boys. You can make
boys do anything.

29:12.228 --> 29:14.128
Gas station attendants,
bartenders...

29:14.228 --> 29:15.727
the occasional migrant worker...

29:15.728 --> 29:18.428
a one-shot seduction
is child's play...

29:18.528 --> 29:21.428
compared to getting someone
to marry you in 3 months.

29:21.528 --> 29:22.927
4 months.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.128
What?

29:25.428 --> 29:28.528
Well, it took you
4 months this time.

29:28.629 --> 29:30.828
You used to be
able to do it in 3.

29:30.829 --> 29:32.228
What are you saying?

29:32.229 --> 29:35.229
That I'm losing it?
I'm getting too old?

29:35.329 --> 29:36.329
I didn't say that.

29:36.429 --> 29:39.629
I'm in terrific shape.
Feel my butt.

29:39.729 --> 29:42.328
Ugh. I am not feeling
your butt again, Mother.

29:42.329 --> 29:44.129
We all know it's wonderful.

29:45.529 --> 29:48.828
I'll tell you what.
We'll play for it.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.129
Winner picks the mark.

29:50.130 --> 29:51.429
Great.

29:51.430 --> 29:52.829
We'll cut cards.

29:52.830 --> 29:55.329
Right. I'm gonna
trust your cards?

29:55.330 --> 29:57.230
See that guy
over there at the bar?

29:58.330 --> 30:01.130
First one to get him
to buy her a drinkwins.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.330
Deal.

30:13.431 --> 30:15.530
Hi.

30:15.531 --> 30:16.831
Hot.

30:16.931 --> 30:19.531
Yeah, sure is.

30:19.631 --> 30:21.131
Oh!

30:29.732 --> 30:31.632
Let me get that for you.

30:33.932 --> 30:35.232
Oh, my!

30:37.132 --> 30:38.332
Would you?

30:38.432 --> 30:39.732
Sure.

30:43.632 --> 30:45.432
Oh, you're so kind.

30:46.632 --> 30:47.632
I'm Betty.

30:48.432 --> 30:50.431
- Hi. My name--
- Excuse me...

30:50.433 --> 30:52.833
may I grab your nuts?

30:56.733 --> 30:58.432
Mmm.

30:58.433 --> 30:59.833
Salty.

31:03.633 --> 31:05.033
Are you OK?

31:05.133 --> 31:06.132
Can I get you a drink?

31:06.133 --> 31:07.233
We go with Tensy.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.633
Stupid jerk!

31:36.635 --> 31:39.635
He doesn't look so bad--
in this light.

31:39.735 --> 31:42.934
Yeah, his liver spots
are positively glowing.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.634
All right, let's run
through it one more time.

31:44.635 --> 31:46.335
I know what to do.

32:01.436 --> 32:02.435
Got a light?

32:02.436 --> 32:03.636
Yeah.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.837
Your trash is on fire.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.337
Holy shit!

32:54.138 --> 32:55.237
Set.

32:55.238 --> 32:56.638
Good. Now stay by the phone.

32:56.739 --> 32:58.038
Timing on this is crucial.

32:58.039 --> 32:59.638
Duh!

32:59.639 --> 33:01.538
Always treating me like a child.

33:01.539 --> 33:02.739
Child!

33:33.240 --> 33:37.240
Excuse me, sir,
but smoking is not permitted.

33:37.340 --> 33:40.140
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

33:43.041 --> 33:44.241
Nazi.

34:08.742 --> 34:11.141
Oh!

34:11.142 --> 34:13.141
Pardon me.

34:13.142 --> 34:14.342
Is no crime.

34:48.044 --> 34:51.744
OK, Dr. Davis, let's see
where you're going tonight.

34:58.344 --> 34:59.744
Good start, Page.

35:08.445 --> 35:09.645
Crap!

35:21.245 --> 35:22.444
Davis residence.

35:22.445 --> 35:24.044
Yeah, Arnold Davis, please.

35:24.046 --> 35:25.945
I'm sorry, he's just left.

35:25.946 --> 35:28.745
Oh, no. This is--

35:28.746 --> 35:30.245
He left me a message.

35:30.246 --> 35:33.145
I'm supposed
to meet him tonight--

35:33.146 --> 35:35.345
I can't read
my maid's handwriting--

35:35.346 --> 35:36.346
Who is this?

35:36.446 --> 35:37.446
This is--

35:38.646 --> 35:39.646
Stupid cell phone.

35:40.646 --> 35:41.846
Mrs. Whiler?

35:41.946 --> 35:44.446
Right. Right.
This is Mrs. Whiler.

35:44.546 --> 35:48.346
I believe he said the Glades.

35:48.447 --> 35:49.647
Right. And that's on?

35:49.747 --> 35:52.346
I think it's on
the far end of Ocean.

35:52.347 --> 35:54.047
Great. Cutting out. Thank--

36:36.149 --> 36:38.348
Hi. Can I get you a drink?

36:38.349 --> 36:41.348
Wow. I've never heard
that one before.

36:41.349 --> 36:43.848
You really blow me away
with your creativity.

36:43.849 --> 36:46.548
- Well, I--
- Well, I...

36:46.549 --> 36:48.049
Your recovery is even better.

36:48.150 --> 36:51.550
Do you even care
at all who I am?

36:51.650 --> 36:53.949
I mean, I could be
the Antichrist or have...

36:53.950 --> 36:55.849
the intelligence of a thermos,
but unfortunately...

36:55.850 --> 36:58.150
those are not the matters
the male penis ponders.

37:00.050 --> 37:01.950
So, please, tell me...

37:02.050 --> 37:03.650
why did you walk
all the way over here...

37:03.750 --> 37:05.850
to ask to get me a drink?

37:07.250 --> 37:09.450
Well, because I'm the bartender.

37:12.151 --> 37:13.251
Oh.

37:14.951 --> 37:16.550
Martini, very dry.

37:16.551 --> 37:17.851
Sure.

37:20.651 --> 37:22.550
Our next item is
an exquisite piece...

37:22.551 --> 37:23.851
from the Kerner estate...

37:23.951 --> 37:27.151
a stunning work
by Feodor Tergeniev...

37:27.251 --> 37:30.651
entitled Form in Repose.

37:32.252 --> 37:35.851
I'm looking for
an opening bid of 130, 000.

37:35.852 --> 37:37.151
130.

37:37.152 --> 37:39.452
Very good. I have 130.
Do I hear 140?

37:39.552 --> 37:40.952
140.

37:41.052 --> 37:43.351
Thank you.
Do I hear 150?

37:43.352 --> 37:45.352
150, 000.

37:48.152 --> 37:50.051
160.

37:50.052 --> 37:52.052
I am offer 170.

37:53.453 --> 37:55.753
175.

37:55.853 --> 37:57.653
Was that 175, sir?

38:00.353 --> 38:02.753
I'll take that.
175, 000.

38:04.953 --> 38:06.452
180.

38:06.453 --> 38:09.753
I have 180.
Do I hear 190?

38:14.154 --> 38:15.654
Do I hear 190?

38:15.754 --> 38:19.754
I really must hear a number
or see a paddle, sir.

38:19.854 --> 38:21.053
I think he--

38:21.054 --> 38:22.553
Yes, ma'am,
I have your bid.

38:22.554 --> 38:25.053
It's to you
at $180, 000.

38:25.054 --> 38:26.454
Going once...

38:26.554 --> 38:28.054
twice...

38:28.154 --> 38:29.853
sold--

38:29.854 --> 38:32.454
to the persistent
woman on my right.

38:36.855 --> 38:39.155
Thanks.
You did good.

38:39.255 --> 38:40.755
Bye.

38:40.855 --> 38:42.855
Uh, that's $3.50.

38:42.955 --> 38:45.255
I'll flip you for it.
Call it.

38:45.355 --> 38:48.055
- No, we don't really--
- Call it!

38:49.655 --> 38:51.055
Tails.

38:52.655 --> 38:56.755
Heads. Oh, too bad.
Thanks.

39:04.356 --> 39:06.056
Well, Jack, looks like
she got a free drink...

39:06.156 --> 39:07.956
and one of your balls.

39:08.056 --> 39:10.356
Nah, I just think she's
nervous being on her own.

39:15.156 --> 39:17.356
Oh, yeah.
She's a delicate flower.

39:43.158 --> 39:47.558
Oh, wait!
I think I see crack.

39:47.658 --> 39:51.158
- That's just his butt, lady.
- Let me see.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.058
Hmm.

39:55.958 --> 39:57.658
Hmm. Oh.

39:59.559 --> 40:00.559
Oh.

40:02.359 --> 40:03.759
Oh.

40:05.059 --> 40:07.059
Ooh.

40:10.659 --> 40:12.259
Looks good.

40:12.359 --> 40:13.759
From where I'm standing...

40:13.859 --> 40:14.859
hmm.

40:35.460 --> 40:36.460
Oh!

40:37.660 --> 40:39.060
Oh, my God!

40:40.061 --> 40:41.060
Oh!

40:41.061 --> 40:42.560
What, what?
What is the matter?

40:42.561 --> 40:45.960
My--my beautiful man.
He ruined.

40:45.961 --> 40:47.061
Ruined!

40:47.161 --> 40:49.560
I'm sure we can have
this expertly repaired.

40:49.561 --> 40:52.560
No. Man thing off,
deal off.

40:52.561 --> 40:56.961
What good is to me now?
He has no "pipiska."

41:42.063 --> 41:44.862
Mother, did you have any
trouble finding the place?

41:44.864 --> 41:46.164
This is beyond civilization.

41:46.264 --> 41:47.564
It was impossible
to find.

41:47.664 --> 41:49.164
Son of a bitch!

42:02.764 --> 42:04.164
Ow!

42:04.265 --> 42:05.964
Ow! Ow!

42:05.965 --> 42:07.564
Oh!

42:07.565 --> 42:09.264
I'm so sorry.

42:09.265 --> 42:10.765
Get away from him!
Get away!

42:10.865 --> 42:14.664
I told you it was dangerous to
come to these low-class bars.

42:14.665 --> 42:17.064
It stings, Mama.
It stings so bad.

42:17.065 --> 42:18.464
Oh, mother will help you.

42:18.465 --> 42:20.165
The retina is detached.

42:20.265 --> 42:22.564
I know it! Ow!

42:22.565 --> 42:24.564
Are you OK now?

42:24.565 --> 42:26.565
Yes. You idi--

42:28.066 --> 42:29.066
"Idi" what?

42:33.566 --> 42:34.565
Yeah.

42:34.566 --> 42:36.065
Subject is en route.

42:36.066 --> 42:37.566
He'll pass the checkpoint
in 10 minutes.

42:37.666 --> 42:39.065
Everything set?

42:39.066 --> 42:40.065
Yeah. Of course.

42:40.066 --> 42:42.065
What's wrong, Page?

42:42.066 --> 42:43.466
Mother can tell
something's wrong.

42:43.566 --> 42:45.366
Mother knows nothing.

42:45.466 --> 42:46.766
I'm following
right behind him...

42:46.867 --> 42:48.967
so be sure
to remove the spikes.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.366
And he mustn't see you.

42:50.367 --> 42:52.267
He must think no one else
is around so we can bond.

42:52.367 --> 42:54.666
I know, I know.
You're driving me crazy.

42:54.667 --> 42:56.367
Well, you're driving me crazy.

42:56.467 --> 42:59.166
Well, that answers
the question of whether...

42:59.167 --> 43:00.867
you're already
in a relationship.

43:00.967 --> 43:04.267
Since you can't seem
to read my subtle signals...

43:04.367 --> 43:06.967
I'll help you out.
Piss off!

43:11.968 --> 43:13.968
Everyone is a little
irritable after they choke.

43:37.869 --> 43:40.369
Two headlights.
That's not him. Crap.

43:52.070 --> 43:54.370
That was wrong
on so many levels.

44:03.970 --> 44:06.070
- You!
- What happened?

44:06.170 --> 44:07.670
What are you doing here?

44:07.770 --> 44:10.169
- I followed you.
- More like stalked me.

44:10.170 --> 44:12.469
Listen, mouth breather,
I am fully capable...

44:12.471 --> 44:14.271
and really in the mood
to kick the shit out of...

44:14.371 --> 44:16.671
your psychotic, skulking ass.

44:20.971 --> 44:22.771
Does this look familiar?

44:24.771 --> 44:25.871
Might be mine.

44:25.971 --> 44:28.270
Well, if you're not sure...

44:28.271 --> 44:30.170
Thanks! Now go.

44:30.171 --> 44:33.070
Look, my car doesn't drive
so good with a tree in it.

44:33.072 --> 44:35.372
What a baby!
It's a flat. I'll fix it.

44:35.472 --> 44:38.071
Wait, first we better go clear
that stuff out of the road.

44:38.072 --> 44:39.072
Another car could--

44:39.172 --> 44:40.972
No! I'll do it.
Just get the spare.

44:41.072 --> 44:41.972
Now!

44:42.072 --> 44:43.871
Look, I'm willing to explore...

44:43.872 --> 44:45.771
the whole being
dominated thing, OK?

44:45.772 --> 44:47.772
But let's just take it slow.

44:54.973 --> 44:56.873
- Uh-oh!
- Watch out!

45:03.673 --> 45:04.573
Oh!

45:06.573 --> 45:07.972
Oh!

45:07.973 --> 45:09.472
What did you push me for?

45:09.473 --> 45:11.273
I saved you, you moron.

45:24.874 --> 45:26.873
That can't be good.
I'd better check it out.

45:26.874 --> 45:29.274
Oh, wait, wait!
I'm hurt.

45:29.374 --> 45:32.074
No, you're not.
Nothing could hurt you.

45:32.174 --> 45:33.774
Are you calling me a liar?

45:33.874 --> 45:36.173
All right,
where are you hurt, then?

45:36.175 --> 45:37.875
My ankle.

45:39.175 --> 45:40.375
See?

45:47.275 --> 45:48.775
What the hell?

45:55.475 --> 45:56.975
Perfect.

45:58.276 --> 45:59.276
Oh!

46:01.476 --> 46:02.576
No!

46:09.576 --> 46:11.575
Jeez, they're really
piling up... up there.

46:11.576 --> 46:12.575
My ankle.

46:12.576 --> 46:14.876
Your ankle is fine.
I'm going.

46:24.677 --> 46:26.176
Are you mixing medications?

46:26.177 --> 46:28.077
You're ruining the magic, idiot.

46:29.877 --> 46:32.277
I'm much sorry.

46:32.377 --> 46:35.677
Must be glass in road.

46:38.578 --> 46:39.877
Ah, the statue stealer.

46:39.878 --> 46:41.478
Why is it whenever I see you...

46:41.578 --> 46:43.477
things seem to be
going into the crapper?

46:43.478 --> 46:46.578
You have head injury.
I rush you to hospital.

46:46.678 --> 46:47.778
No, no, no.

46:49.078 --> 46:51.277
I don't. No. No.

46:51.278 --> 46:52.777
The police will
be along shortly...

46:52.778 --> 46:55.278
and they'll sort this out.

46:58.078 --> 46:59.078
Ooh!

46:59.779 --> 47:00.679
See?

47:00.779 --> 47:03.778
Delayed shooting head pains.

47:03.779 --> 47:06.878
Come. To hospital we go.

47:06.879 --> 47:09.078
What about your car?
You have flat tires.

47:09.079 --> 47:10.478
Oh, is nothing.

47:10.479 --> 47:11.879
Ooh.

47:22.380 --> 47:24.980
What the hell are you doing?
Get off me!

47:25.080 --> 47:26.579
What?

47:26.580 --> 47:27.980
- You were the one who...
- I got to go.

47:38.980 --> 47:40.579
How do I look?

47:40.580 --> 47:42.979
If I were a guy, I'd do you.

47:42.981 --> 47:45.180
You're sweet.

47:45.181 --> 47:48.081
I'm going back to the hospital
to see if I can fix...

47:48.181 --> 47:49.581
the mess you made last night.

47:49.681 --> 47:51.980
With that on,
he'll forgive anything.

47:51.981 --> 47:53.180
He better...

47:53.181 --> 47:54.380
for your sake.

47:54.381 --> 47:56.281
Be nice or I won't tell you
which eye looks bigger.

47:58.281 --> 47:59.680
Which?

47:59.681 --> 48:02.981
- Are you going to be nice?
- I'm always nice.

48:03.082 --> 48:04.381
The left.

48:04.382 --> 48:05.882
Here, use my eyeliner.

48:09.082 --> 48:10.582
Shit.

48:12.782 --> 48:15.181
I want my purse, jerk-off.

48:15.182 --> 48:17.381
That's not very friendly.

48:17.382 --> 48:18.882
Now, I want you
to go back out...

48:18.982 --> 48:20.381
and this time,
when you kick the door open...

48:20.382 --> 48:21.681
say something nice.

48:21.682 --> 48:23.381
You stole my purse, dipshit...

48:23.382 --> 48:26.281
and you stole it so I'd have to
see your ugly-ass face again.

48:26.283 --> 48:30.182
No, you forgot your purse
for the second time...

48:30.183 --> 48:31.682
because you were in such
a hurry to strand me...

48:31.683 --> 48:34.082
- in the middle of nowhere.
- Look, just give it to me.

48:34.083 --> 48:36.782
Or would you rather have
my heel up your ass?

48:36.783 --> 48:39.283
Who told you I'm into that?

48:43.483 --> 48:44.982
Pretty rough on
the boss, weren't you?

48:44.984 --> 48:46.883
You know, he's not
really into ass play.

48:46.884 --> 48:48.384
That's just, like,
his sense of humor.

48:49.384 --> 48:50.884
He owns this place?

48:50.984 --> 48:53.183
Yeah, his dad left it to him.

48:53.184 --> 48:54.584
Of course, all these
development creeps...

48:54.684 --> 48:56.984
are trying to give him,
like, 3 mil for the place.

48:57.084 --> 49:00.384
Whole world's going to be
Gaps and Starbucks, right?

49:03.084 --> 49:04.683
He's loaded.

49:04.684 --> 49:07.084
Good, Page.

49:12.385 --> 49:13.285
Greetings.

49:16.485 --> 49:17.784
Oh, it's you.

49:17.785 --> 49:19.785
Doctors don't want me to smoke.

49:19.885 --> 49:21.284
It's ridiculous.

49:21.285 --> 49:23.485
They depend on cigarettes.

49:23.585 --> 49:26.585
A perfect scapegoat
for their incompetence.

49:26.686 --> 49:28.886
I assume you're here
about the insurance.

49:28.986 --> 49:29.986
My attorneys will
take care of it.

49:30.086 --> 49:31.886
That won't be necessary.

49:31.986 --> 49:33.185
I have no want to sue you.

49:33.186 --> 49:34.185
Sue me?

49:34.186 --> 49:36.186
My people will tear you a new...

49:36.286 --> 49:41.786
I am only come
to see how you feel...

49:43.186 --> 49:47.686
my poor, poor, Babushka.

49:51.987 --> 49:54.386
That's very nice of you, Mrs...

49:54.387 --> 49:57.187
Miss.
Just call me...

49:58.887 --> 50:00.487
Ulga.

50:02.087 --> 50:05.386
- Ulga?
- Mmm.

50:05.387 --> 50:07.387
Well, that's lovely, Ulga.

50:37.889 --> 50:38.888
Yes?

50:38.889 --> 50:41.988
I am Ulga Yevanova.
I am here to...

50:41.989 --> 50:45.489
Yes. We've been expecting you.

50:45.589 --> 50:49.888
I am Miss Madress.
I run this household.

50:49.889 --> 50:52.989
Oh, good for you.

50:53.090 --> 50:54.690
I will announce you.

50:58.790 --> 51:00.390
We have a bitch alert.

51:05.690 --> 51:08.289
Come on, bartender.
It's your night off.

51:08.290 --> 51:10.190
Do something fun.

51:14.591 --> 51:16.291
Good boy.

51:38.292 --> 51:40.591
I love it here.

51:40.592 --> 51:42.292
It's the only
bloody place left...

51:42.392 --> 51:44.091
that doesn't make you feel
like a serial killer...

51:44.092 --> 51:45.592
for having a damn smoke.

51:45.692 --> 51:47.292
Yes, is lovely.

51:49.992 --> 51:52.991
I'll be your waiter
tonight--Vladimir.

51:52.992 --> 51:54.892
Allow me to tell you
tonight's specials.

51:54.993 --> 51:56.793
No need for English
tonight, Vlad.

51:56.893 --> 51:58.793
We have one of
your country women here.

51:58.893 --> 52:00.393
Oh, wonderful.

52:02.593 --> 52:03.693
So, tonight we have...

52:05.993 --> 52:06.993
Da.

52:08.693 --> 52:10.293
Da. Da.

52:16.494 --> 52:18.793
Excellent choice.
The steak tartare.

52:18.794 --> 52:23.594
Oh, I love a woman
who eats raw meat.

52:46.695 --> 52:48.795
That's real nice!

52:59.396 --> 53:00.795
You're not just going
to stand there.

53:00.796 --> 53:01.796
Help me.

53:02.696 --> 53:04.495
Please.

53:04.496 --> 53:07.795
Isn't that the shoe you
wanted to jam up my ass?

53:07.796 --> 53:10.195
No, that was the 6-inch heel.

53:10.196 --> 53:11.996
Now come on.

53:12.796 --> 53:14.596
What are you doing here?

53:14.696 --> 53:17.596
Uh...working.

53:17.696 --> 53:19.596
Working?

53:19.697 --> 53:22.397
You some kind of wilderness
female mud wrestler?

53:23.797 --> 53:25.497
I am an environmentalist
studying the effect...

53:25.597 --> 53:28.397
of waste run of from
the neighboring wetlands.

53:28.897 --> 53:30.896
Oh, well...

53:30.897 --> 53:34.396
you environmentalists
really dress hot.

53:34.397 --> 53:35.597
Yeah, well...

53:35.697 --> 53:37.596
there's no law that says
you can't look good...

53:37.597 --> 53:39.497
while you're saving stuff.

53:39.598 --> 53:41.197
So, why are you following me?

53:41.198 --> 53:44.598
- I'm not following you!
- Then what are you doing here?

53:46.098 --> 53:47.998
Come on, I'll show you.

53:48.598 --> 53:51.998
You're not out here burying
high-school kids, are you?

53:53.298 --> 53:55.198
Well, they egged my car.

54:05.499 --> 54:08.298
What do you do?
Spy on people humping in boats?

54:08.299 --> 54:09.899
That's so perverted.

54:09.999 --> 54:12.298
I photograph stars.

54:12.299 --> 54:13.798
Look, just because
they're famous...

54:13.799 --> 54:16.799
doesn't mean they don't deserve
their privacy, too.

54:16.899 --> 54:18.399
Who you got?

54:19.799 --> 54:21.899
The stars up there.

54:23.600 --> 54:26.200
You sneak all the way out here
to stare at space and shit?

54:27.100 --> 54:30.499
No, I come here to get away
from the lights of the city...

54:30.500 --> 54:33.700
so I can see
the space and shit.

54:35.800 --> 54:38.000
- Why?
- Take a look.

54:44.101 --> 54:46.000
Jesus.

54:46.001 --> 54:47.800
That's the Crab Nebula.

54:47.801 --> 54:50.801
That is the exact color
of a sapphire ring I wanted.

54:52.101 --> 54:53.101
OK.

54:56.001 --> 54:57.600
And this...

54:57.601 --> 55:00.800
is the great
globular cluster in Hercules.

55:00.801 --> 55:02.601
I don't think
I want to see that.

55:07.502 --> 55:08.701
Wow.

55:08.702 --> 55:10.402
Good cluster.

55:10.502 --> 55:14.802
And I think you can also see
the Corona Borealis, too.

55:14.902 --> 55:17.602
Wait, wait, I'm not done
with the globular thing.

55:21.202 --> 55:22.202
OK...

55:47.604 --> 55:50.603
I love to watch a woman eat.

55:50.604 --> 55:53.404
It is surely one of
the most sensual acts.

56:20.505 --> 56:23.904
Is such joy to hear
my native tongue again.

56:23.905 --> 56:28.105
I deeply appreciate
what you say, and...

56:30.506 --> 56:32.106
what you don't say.

56:36.606 --> 56:40.606
Oh, William,
so much loudness.

56:40.706 --> 56:46.305
Can we not go somewhere
I can relate to you...

56:46.306 --> 56:47.306
orally.

56:50.107 --> 56:51.307
All right.

56:51.407 --> 56:54.407
Who will favor us
with next song?

56:59.007 --> 57:01.207
We have a fellow
country woman here.

57:01.307 --> 57:02.807
No, I am so...

57:05.007 --> 57:07.707
Please, I am so not musical.

57:09.207 --> 57:11.706
- Please, uh...
- How about "Karabuschka?"

57:11.708 --> 57:13.707
I know there isn't
a Russian alive...

57:13.708 --> 57:15.508
who doesn't know "Karabuschka!"

57:28.108 --> 57:32.108
Karabuschka

57:32.209 --> 57:35.209
Da, da, da

57:38.409 --> 57:40.309
Moscow

57:42.109 --> 57:43.609
Leningrad

57:46.309 --> 57:47.309
Minsk...

57:48.609 --> 57:52.808
Oh, you know,
I am just fooling.

57:52.810 --> 57:56.910
I am so full
of good humor.

58:12.310 --> 58:18.609
Flew in from
Miami Beach B.O.A.C.

58:18.611 --> 58:22.311
Didn't get to bed last night

58:24.011 --> 58:29.711
On the way the paper bag
was on my knee

58:29.811 --> 58:33.110
Man, I had a dread ful flight

58:33.111 --> 58:35.111
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.

58:36.912 --> 58:39.912
You don't know
how lucky you are, boy

58:40.012 --> 58:42.112
Back in the U.S.S.R.

58:44.912 --> 58:48.412
Been away so long
I hardly knew the place

58:48.512 --> 58:50.812
Gee, it's good to be back home

58:51.812 --> 58:55.211
Leave it till tomorrow
to unpack my case

58:55.212 --> 58:57.411
Honey, disconnect the phone

58:57.413 --> 58:59.313
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.

59:00.813 --> 59:04.112
You don't know
how lucky you are, boy

59:04.113 --> 59:05.312
Back in the U.S.

59:05.313 --> 59:06.713
Back in the U.S.

59:06.813 --> 59:09.013
Back in the U.S.S.R.

59:11.013 --> 59:12.513
Look, there's another one.

59:15.013 --> 59:16.913
Oh, there's two at once.
Did you see that?

59:17.014 --> 59:18.114
Yeah.

59:18.214 --> 59:21.314
God, I never knew you could
have this much fun for free.

59:23.214 --> 59:26.614
Well, it's not completely free.

59:31.914 --> 59:35.314
So, are you ready
to tell me the truth?

59:35.414 --> 59:37.913
What?

59:37.915 --> 59:40.115
Tell me why
you're here, really.

59:41.215 --> 59:44.814
I told you,
I'm an environmentalist...

59:44.815 --> 59:47.714
student at
the University of Miami.

59:47.715 --> 59:49.715
What? You don't believe me?

59:51.115 --> 59:53.114
Well, I'd like to, but...

59:53.115 --> 59:54.815
What about my butt?

59:57.915 --> 1:00:00.414
- Ooh, I got to go.
- Again?

1:00:00.416 --> 1:00:03.715
- Yeah, I have work to do.
- It's 11:00 at night.

1:00:03.716 --> 1:00:06.316
I know, but I have to write
an environmental impact report.

1:00:06.416 --> 1:00:08.316
Will it mention me?

1:00:09.316 --> 1:00:11.616
- Wait! What's your name?
- Uh, Jane.

1:00:11.716 --> 1:00:13.015
Will I see you again?

1:00:13.016 --> 1:00:14.816
Try wishing on a star.

1:00:24.017 --> 1:00:25.817
Is that 5 people?

1:00:32.717 --> 1:00:34.017
Keys are in it.

1:00:54.418 --> 1:00:56.518
Hey, Mom.
How did it go?

1:00:57.118 --> 1:00:58.618
Perfect.

1:01:00.218 --> 1:01:04.617
His infatuation
is right on schedule.

1:01:04.619 --> 1:01:05.818
You know, you're home now.

1:01:05.819 --> 1:01:07.419
You can stop
with the accent.

1:01:08.619 --> 1:01:11.019
- What's that?
- What's what?

1:01:14.019 --> 1:01:17.318
- Mud?
- I gave myself a facial...

1:01:17.319 --> 1:01:18.919
some special local stuff.

1:01:20.119 --> 1:01:22.819
I think I'll to take a nice
long shower and go to bed.

1:01:22.919 --> 1:01:23.919
Good night.

1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:42.619
Smoking is part of
the fun of being a kid.

1:01:42.620 --> 1:01:45.819
We just did some tests
on some 9-year-olds.

1:01:45.821 --> 1:01:47.021
After a little puking...

1:01:47.121 --> 1:01:49.521
why, you couldn't drag them
away from the stuff.

1:01:50.821 --> 1:01:52.721
You're only young once.

1:01:52.821 --> 1:01:54.521
Why not indulge, I always say.

1:01:55.621 --> 1:01:58.520
Oh, darling, what matter?

1:01:58.521 --> 1:02:00.620
Head pain back again?

1:02:00.621 --> 1:02:02.721
No, no, it's all right.

1:02:13.522 --> 1:02:17.822
- I have a gift for you.
- A gift?

1:02:19.022 --> 1:02:21.822
A gift! Oh!

1:02:26.022 --> 1:02:33.121
Oh, a personal fire device.

1:02:33.123 --> 1:02:35.322
I'm not insisting
you take up smoking...

1:02:35.323 --> 1:02:39.122
but I thought it would
give you some incentive.

1:02:39.123 --> 1:02:43.623
There is nothing sexier
than smoke billowing proudly...

1:02:43.723 --> 1:02:49.923
out of a woman's hot,
red, engorged nostrils.

1:02:51.824 --> 1:02:56.223
That image will haunt me.

1:02:56.224 --> 1:02:57.823
Still a little sleepy, my dear?

1:02:57.824 --> 1:03:03.024
Oh, no, no, it was
another wonderful night.

1:03:04.524 --> 1:03:09.223
I think that I deserve
a big kiss for that big gift.

1:03:09.225 --> 1:03:12.125
Oh, yes.

1:03:12.225 --> 1:03:14.425
Is no getting
around that.

1:03:22.625 --> 1:03:24.124
Oh, oh, no.

1:03:24.125 --> 1:03:29.824
We mustn't.
God is everywhere.

1:03:29.826 --> 1:03:32.526
Yes, he is, isn't he?

1:03:32.626 --> 1:03:34.126
Nosy bastard.

1:03:35.426 --> 1:03:39.026
I'll have Miss Madress
get your purse.

1:03:46.726 --> 1:03:48.926
Is he that repulsive to you?

1:03:52.027 --> 1:03:57.026
No. Is Russian
expression of happiness.

1:03:57.027 --> 1:03:59.327
Ptui, ptui,
oh, I am so happy.

1:03:59.427 --> 1:04:02.127
Save it.
I'm on to you.

1:04:03.727 --> 1:04:06.127
You're attracted to me?

1:04:06.227 --> 1:04:08.927
Oh, flattering,
but I no do females.

1:04:09.627 --> 1:04:11.926
I've been with him for 7 years.

1:04:11.928 --> 1:04:13.727
I've seen him with many women.

1:04:13.728 --> 1:04:15.228
I've never worried.

1:04:15.328 --> 1:04:17.327
Passing amusements.

1:04:17.328 --> 1:04:20.028
But you, oh, you're good, baby.

1:04:20.828 --> 1:04:23.928
I no understand.
What is you want?

1:04:24.028 --> 1:04:29.628
I is want your ex-commie ass
out of his life.

1:04:29.728 --> 1:04:31.328
I didn't put up
with his crap for years...

1:04:31.428 --> 1:04:33.227
just to be squeezed out
right before he kicks.

1:04:33.229 --> 1:04:35.528
I've put in the time,
and I expect a big payoff.

1:04:35.529 --> 1:04:41.328
Oh, you must believe,
I have true feelings for him.

1:04:41.329 --> 1:04:44.729
Oh, spare me
your Bolshevik bullshit.

1:04:44.829 --> 1:04:46.028
Either you disappear...

1:04:46.029 --> 1:04:48.429
or I tell him exactly
what I saw.

1:04:49.629 --> 1:04:52.729
Your dark honesty
is refreshing...

1:04:52.829 --> 1:04:54.928
but please, I beg you...

1:04:54.930 --> 1:04:58.930
Leave me one more night
to bow out gracefully.

1:05:13.430 --> 1:05:15.030
I have something for you.

1:05:23.031 --> 1:05:25.730
I know it's not the sapphire
you wanted, but...

1:05:25.731 --> 1:05:28.531
It sure isn't.

1:05:28.631 --> 1:05:30.931
It's a meteor fragment.

1:05:31.031 --> 1:05:32.530
Like the ones
we were watching?

1:05:32.531 --> 1:05:35.831
That's been to the far reaches
of our solar system and back.

1:05:35.931 --> 1:05:38.231
No lousy sapphire has
ever pulled that off.

1:05:40.532 --> 1:05:43.832
You don't do anything
like normal people, do you?

1:05:44.432 --> 1:05:45.532
Some things.

1:06:30.934 --> 1:06:32.433
Kitchen's through there.

1:06:32.434 --> 1:06:35.834
Master bedroom's upstairs.
Her room is down the hall.

1:06:35.934 --> 1:06:37.433
You have 7 minutes.

1:06:37.434 --> 1:06:38.933
Here you go.

1:06:38.934 --> 1:06:39.934
The thing that's screwing us...

1:06:40.035 --> 1:06:43.135
is all this secondhand
smoke nonsense.

1:06:44.035 --> 1:06:45.634
They've convicted
the tobacco companies...

1:06:45.635 --> 1:06:47.535
without a shred of evidence.

1:06:50.735 --> 1:06:54.134
Hmm...is oddness.

1:06:54.135 --> 1:06:55.835
What?

1:06:55.935 --> 1:06:59.335
Costly lighter gift
you gave is missing.

1:06:59.435 --> 1:07:02.034
Oh, you must have
left it somewhere.

1:07:02.036 --> 1:07:05.135
Never. I cherish too much.

1:07:05.136 --> 1:07:06.736
Perhaps...

1:07:08.136 --> 1:07:09.935
No.

1:07:09.936 --> 1:07:13.836
Is inconceivablish.

1:07:13.936 --> 1:07:15.336
What is inconceivablish?

1:07:17.336 --> 1:07:20.235
Well, your housekeep
did much admire...

1:07:20.236 --> 1:07:26.836
and when she give me purse
to leave yesterday, was open.

1:07:28.437 --> 1:07:29.537
Sir, I swear to you...

1:07:29.637 --> 1:07:32.537
I would never take so much as
a hairpin from this household.

1:07:33.737 --> 1:07:36.436
Is this not clothing
you wear yesterday...

1:07:36.437 --> 1:07:38.737
when you see me out?

1:07:40.437 --> 1:07:41.537
Hello.

1:07:44.238 --> 1:07:45.837
She set me up.

1:07:45.838 --> 1:07:48.638
She could have slipped that
into my pocket any time.

1:07:51.738 --> 1:07:54.437
You doubt me?

1:07:54.438 --> 1:07:56.138
Oh, William.

1:08:03.839 --> 1:08:06.739
Oh, how you can sleep
on so lumpy a...

1:08:09.039 --> 1:08:10.538
My wife's old jewelry.

1:08:10.539 --> 1:08:14.339
Why you are stealing from
loyal, kind employer man?

1:08:14.439 --> 1:08:17.439
No! It's her.
Can't you see?

1:08:18.139 --> 1:08:19.739
You bitch!

1:08:25.140 --> 1:08:27.340
My cigarettes?

1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:29.840
I feel like vomiting.

1:08:30.540 --> 1:08:33.940
Oh, please, Mr. Tensy.

1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:36.639
I have been a dedicated
and trust worthy servant...

1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:38.239
for over 7 years.

1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:40.639
Look into my eyes.

1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:43.640
You must believe in my complete
and total innocence.

1:08:56.741 --> 1:08:59.540
If it's at all possible...

1:08:59.541 --> 1:09:01.641
could you slap her around
a little bit?

1:09:03.841 --> 1:09:05.340
That's very good, Darling.

1:09:05.341 --> 1:09:08.140
You're doing better.

1:09:08.142 --> 1:09:10.342
Come on, let's hear
a little pain.

1:09:11.842 --> 1:09:13.441
I've set you up with
an interview...

1:09:13.442 --> 1:09:15.742
for Tensy's housekeeper
position tomorrow.

1:09:15.842 --> 1:09:17.742
Tomorrow?
That's Saturday.

1:09:17.842 --> 1:09:20.141
Well, there are no weekends
in conning, dear.

1:09:20.142 --> 1:09:21.941
I'll go the first thing Monday.

1:09:21.942 --> 1:09:23.742
No, you'll go tomorrow.

1:09:23.842 --> 1:09:26.141
We can't take the chance of
someone else getting that job.

1:09:26.142 --> 1:09:27.942
You have to start
getting close to him now.

1:09:28.043 --> 1:09:30.642
My god, he's days away
from popping the question.

1:09:30.643 --> 1:09:32.143
No way.

1:09:32.243 --> 1:09:34.043
You couldn't have gotten
him that far this fast.

1:09:34.143 --> 1:09:36.043
Have you really
learned so little?

1:09:37.143 --> 1:09:40.243
One month flat.
That's a new record.

1:09:40.343 --> 1:09:41.743
Mom's still got it.

1:09:43.643 --> 1:09:45.243
Jack, I'm still
coming to the game.

1:09:45.343 --> 1:09:46.843
I just may be a little late,
that's all.

1:09:48.343 --> 1:09:50.342
Well, hey, I'm sure
the van can wait...

1:09:50.344 --> 1:09:51.844
for, like, 5 minutes.

1:09:53.144 --> 1:09:55.143
Look, I-I'll probably
make it on time anyway.

1:09:55.144 --> 1:09:56.143
I gotta go.

1:09:56.144 --> 1:09:57.144
Bye.

1:09:59.344 --> 1:10:02.343
Sorry I'm running late,
Miss Breckenhall, but...

1:10:02.344 --> 1:10:06.544
I've been losing consciousness
more frequently lately.

1:10:06.644 --> 1:10:08.643
Allergy season, I think.

1:10:08.644 --> 1:10:10.643
Well, it's no problem at all...

1:10:10.645 --> 1:10:12.244
But please, call me Allison.

1:10:12.245 --> 1:10:13.444
Oh, well...

1:10:13.445 --> 1:10:14.745
Allison, I--

1:10:14.845 --> 1:10:16.745
I just have a few
questions to ask you.

1:10:27.345 --> 1:10:29.845
Do you smoke, Allison?

1:10:29.945 --> 1:10:32.944
- No.
- No.

1:10:32.946 --> 1:10:34.746
Well, uh...

1:10:39.346 --> 1:10:40.945
we gotta go!

1:10:40.946 --> 1:10:43.145
She said she'd be
a little late.

1:10:43.146 --> 1:10:45.945
20 minutes
is not a little.

1:10:45.946 --> 1:10:48.345
We've entered
stood-up territory.

1:10:48.346 --> 1:10:49.945
Then I worked for
the English Ambassador...

1:10:49.946 --> 1:10:52.546
to Turkey for 4 1/2 years,
until they shot him.

1:10:52.647 --> 1:10:54.246
Oh, they shot him?

1:10:54.247 --> 1:10:55.747
But I kept cleaning...

1:10:55.847 --> 1:10:57.747
right up until they
burned the embassy down.

1:10:57.847 --> 1:10:59.947
Well, that was very loyal.

1:11:00.047 --> 1:11:02.246
So, when should I start?

1:11:02.247 --> 1:11:04.446
If you could just...

1:11:04.447 --> 1:11:06.246
fill out
this application form...

1:11:06.247 --> 1:11:07.246
then I can, uh...

1:11:07.247 --> 1:11:09.147
verify your employment.

1:11:09.247 --> 1:11:11.347
Oh, certainly.

1:11:11.447 --> 1:11:13.846
Oh! Oh!

1:11:13.848 --> 1:11:15.247
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

1:11:15.248 --> 1:11:16.247
Oh...

1:11:16.248 --> 1:11:17.948
I'll get towel.

1:11:36.149 --> 1:11:39.648
Y-You seem very dedicated
to your work, Allison.

1:11:39.649 --> 1:11:41.249
Something inside me--

1:11:41.349 --> 1:11:44.449
this need to please my employer
in any way possible.

1:11:51.049 --> 1:11:52.448
Here is towel.

1:11:52.449 --> 1:11:55.449
And I find other
employment form.

1:11:55.550 --> 1:11:57.649
Oh, well...

1:11:57.650 --> 1:12:00.250
I-I don't think
that'll be necessary.

1:12:00.350 --> 1:12:02.850
Allison seems...

1:12:02.950 --> 1:12:04.450
more than qualified.

1:12:07.750 --> 1:12:09.550
Hmm, it's still wet.

1:12:12.250 --> 1:12:13.550
Not bad, huh?

1:12:15.250 --> 1:12:16.749
Oh, what?

1:12:16.751 --> 1:12:17.851
It's just a little hacky...

1:12:17.951 --> 1:12:21.051
to go right for
the member massage.

1:12:21.151 --> 1:12:23.051
What are you doing
the rest of today?

1:12:23.151 --> 1:12:24.750
Oh, um, I don't know.

1:12:24.751 --> 1:12:26.051
Beach, nap, nothing.

1:12:26.151 --> 1:12:27.151
See ya.

1:12:45.252 --> 1:12:47.052
Shit!

1:12:47.152 --> 1:12:50.452
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1:12:52.852 --> 1:12:55.552
You really are
a delicate flower.

1:12:55.652 --> 1:12:57.951
Jack!

1:12:57.952 --> 1:13:00.651
You missed the game.
Why didn't you go?

1:13:00.653 --> 1:13:02.152
I don't know.

1:13:02.153 --> 1:13:04.953
My friends have
this theory that...

1:13:07.653 --> 1:13:09.153
I'm in love with you.

1:13:40.554 --> 1:13:41.854
Hello, Daughter.

1:13:43.955 --> 1:13:45.055
What are you doing here?

1:13:45.155 --> 1:13:46.754
I thought you'd be
out with Tensy.

1:13:46.755 --> 1:13:49.555
Sometimes people aren't where
they say they're going to be.

1:13:49.655 --> 1:13:51.454
Oh, well, I got bored
hanging around here...

1:13:51.455 --> 1:13:52.954
so I took myself out for a walk.

1:13:52.955 --> 1:13:54.654
Bullshit.

1:13:54.655 --> 1:13:58.355
I saw you with your boy friend.

1:13:58.455 --> 1:14:00.554
You spied on me?

1:14:00.555 --> 1:14:03.254
So, this is why you've been
being so nice to me.

1:14:03.256 --> 1:14:04.755
I have not been nice to you.

1:14:04.756 --> 1:14:08.655
You betray me
for some bartender.

1:14:08.656 --> 1:14:11.555
That bartender
happens to own the bar...

1:14:11.556 --> 1:14:14.255
and has a firm offer
to sell for 3 million.

1:14:14.256 --> 1:14:15.555
You're not ready, Page.

1:14:15.556 --> 1:14:17.055
Yeah, so not ready
that I already got him...

1:14:17.056 --> 1:14:18.256
to say he loves me.

1:14:18.356 --> 1:14:20.356
I mean you're not
ready to con a guy...

1:14:20.456 --> 1:14:22.255
without falling
in love yourself.

1:14:22.256 --> 1:14:24.055
Give me a break.
I am in complete control.

1:14:24.057 --> 1:14:25.056
I saw the kiss.

1:14:25.057 --> 1:14:26.757
Your eyes were closed.

1:14:28.057 --> 1:14:29.356
That was the sun.

1:14:29.357 --> 1:14:31.557
Last time the sun
got in my eyes...

1:14:31.657 --> 1:14:32.756
I wound up
with a daughter.

1:14:32.757 --> 1:14:34.057
Yeah, and that's just
about the worst thing...

1:14:34.157 --> 1:14:35.857
that ever happened
to you, isn't it?

1:14:38.657 --> 1:14:41.057
I'm a pro, Mother,
and I'll prove it.

1:15:01.658 --> 1:15:04.058
There, nothing...

1:15:05.159 --> 1:15:08.458
but the best from you.

1:15:08.459 --> 1:15:10.559
Well, give me a chance
to make it even better.

1:15:30.060 --> 1:15:31.160
Crap!

1:15:31.260 --> 1:15:33.759
- What's wrong?
- I got ta go.

1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:36.059
- Why?
- Because I'm no good for you.

1:15:36.060 --> 1:15:37.759
I'll be the judge
of that.

1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:39.559
No, I just--
you have to trust me.

1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:40.959
I am not a good person.

1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:41.959
No, you are good.

1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:44.259
You may not know it,
but I do.

1:15:44.260 --> 1:15:46.660
You come on tough,
but it's all just an act.

1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:47.759
I mean, you
don't even believe...

1:15:47.761 --> 1:15:49.260
in sleeping together
before marriage.

1:15:49.261 --> 1:15:51.060
You're like a Brady
or an Osmond or something.

1:15:51.061 --> 1:15:52.760
Look, you don't get it, OK?

1:15:52.761 --> 1:15:55.160
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

1:15:55.161 --> 1:15:58.560
Look, I know you're not
really an environmentalist.

1:15:58.561 --> 1:15:59.960
Who cares?

1:15:59.961 --> 1:16:01.260
The important thing is...

1:16:01.261 --> 1:16:03.561
I love you
and I want to be with you.

1:16:06.861 --> 1:16:08.161
I got ta go.

1:16:15.562 --> 1:16:17.862
You win.
I drop the con.

1:16:17.962 --> 1:16:21.062
- It's for the best, Dear.
- Shut up, Mother.

1:16:41.263 --> 1:16:42.363
Barbara!

1:16:49.363 --> 1:16:51.063
You are a lifesaver.

1:16:51.164 --> 1:16:54.263
To pull that job off
on such short notice--

1:16:54.264 --> 1:16:56.064
I was taught by the best.

1:16:56.164 --> 1:16:57.463
I had a blast.

1:16:57.464 --> 1:16:58.963
I've been out of
the game for so long...

1:16:58.964 --> 1:17:00.463
I've forgotten how much
fun it could be--

1:17:00.464 --> 1:17:02.663
even though we were
conning your own daughter...

1:17:02.664 --> 1:17:05.663
who I haven't seen
since she was what, 4?

1:17:05.664 --> 1:17:06.863
3.

1:17:06.864 --> 1:17:08.464
But we weren't conning her.

1:17:08.564 --> 1:17:10.164
We were protecting her.

1:17:10.264 --> 1:17:12.464
She wanted to run
off on her own...

1:17:12.565 --> 1:17:14.564
and this was the only
way to stop her.

1:17:14.565 --> 1:17:16.965
You know, you won't be
able to stop her forever.

1:17:18.265 --> 1:17:19.165
I know that.

1:17:19.265 --> 1:17:22.665
You know, Page is an amazing,
brilliant, talented girl.

1:17:22.765 --> 1:17:24.364
But she's still green.

1:17:24.365 --> 1:17:25.364
When she's ready...

1:17:25.365 --> 1:17:27.064
I'll be the first
one to tell her.

1:17:27.065 --> 1:17:28.965
And you're sure
she's not ready now?

1:17:31.065 --> 1:17:33.364
I just caught her
kissing some loser...

1:17:33.366 --> 1:17:35.366
with her eyes closed.

1:17:36.866 --> 1:17:38.266
Really?

1:17:42.466 --> 1:17:43.966
I'll get this.

1:17:46.766 --> 1:17:47.866
Classy.

1:17:47.966 --> 1:17:49.466
I'm still learning from you.

1:17:54.967 --> 1:17:56.067
Sweetie, I'm home.

1:17:57.167 --> 1:17:59.067
Sounds like a good day.

1:17:59.167 --> 1:18:00.867
Yeah, it was fantastic.

1:18:00.967 --> 1:18:02.266
Yech, what is Tensy...

1:18:02.267 --> 1:18:03.667
Like, the largest
producer of phlegm...

1:18:03.767 --> 1:18:05.066
on the East Coast?

1:18:05.067 --> 1:18:06.667
I just officially quit smoking.

1:18:06.767 --> 1:18:09.167
Well, the good news
keeps on coming.

1:18:09.267 --> 1:18:11.866
Hey, I got a killer
dress for tonight.

1:18:11.867 --> 1:18:14.566
That, plus the official
letter cannot fail.

1:18:14.567 --> 1:18:17.567
- You want to see?
- No. I'm going out for a walk.

1:18:21.268 --> 1:18:23.168
Ok, well, uh...

1:18:23.268 --> 1:18:24.368
I'm already late.

1:18:29.768 --> 1:18:31.768
Jane, Jane!
Don't hang up!

1:18:39.269 --> 1:18:42.268
You gotta give up
on that girl, man.

1:18:42.269 --> 1:18:45.269
Yeah, there's something
weird about her.

1:18:46.769 --> 1:18:48.868
Yeah, but that's what I liked.

1:18:48.869 --> 1:18:51.069
Me, too.

1:19:02.970 --> 1:19:04.870
What are you doing here?

1:19:04.970 --> 1:19:06.369
I was coming to you.

1:19:06.370 --> 1:19:07.570
Let me in.

1:19:07.670 --> 1:19:09.169
I have a surprise.

1:19:09.170 --> 1:19:11.469
Uh, moment.
I'm, uh...naked.

1:19:11.470 --> 1:19:14.270
I don't see a problem there.

1:19:14.370 --> 1:19:16.170
Here I come!

1:19:32.271 --> 1:19:34.770
- Oh, my.
- Completely restored.

1:19:34.771 --> 1:19:37.971
Only 7,000 for a new willy.

1:19:39.172 --> 1:19:41.371
It's so nice.

1:19:41.372 --> 1:19:43.072
But, uh...

1:19:43.172 --> 1:19:45.772
William, you know
how the Lord feels...

1:19:45.872 --> 1:19:48.672
about having men in hotel room.

1:19:49.672 --> 1:19:50.671
even a man who has ordered...

1:19:50.672 --> 1:19:52.672
champagne and oysters
from room service?

1:19:58.372 --> 1:20:00.672
It's OK. I didn't
charge it to your room.

1:20:01.673 --> 1:20:04.073
I cannot anymore see you.

1:20:05.273 --> 1:20:07.173
Why on earth not?

1:20:07.273 --> 1:20:09.272
Oh, let us leave at that.

1:20:09.273 --> 1:20:10.472
Make pain less.

1:20:10.473 --> 1:20:13.673
Good-bye forever.

1:20:17.473 --> 1:20:19.773
No, no. What is
this all about?

1:20:25.274 --> 1:20:27.573
"We regret to in form you
that your application...

1:20:27.574 --> 1:20:30.874
"for permanent residence
has been denied.

1:20:30.974 --> 1:20:34.474
"you must leave the country
no later than tomorrow."

1:20:35.274 --> 1:20:39.273
I try everything, but is
very political red tape...

1:20:39.274 --> 1:20:42.674
to get green card,
and I am loophole less.

1:20:44.175 --> 1:20:45.774
Well...

1:20:45.775 --> 1:20:47.075
this is horrible.

1:20:48.475 --> 1:20:50.574
And to think I was going
to ask you to marry me.

1:20:50.575 --> 1:20:52.275
Marry you?

1:20:52.375 --> 1:20:55.075
Yes, yes, I, uh...

1:20:55.175 --> 1:20:59.575
purchased a ring
and everything.

1:21:00.475 --> 1:21:02.475
But with your leaving...

1:21:03.476 --> 1:21:07.176
I am but ignorant,
unintelligible foreigner...

1:21:07.276 --> 1:21:10.676
but if you marry me,
I believe that puts, uh...

1:21:10.776 --> 1:21:13.276
kibosh on deportation.

1:21:13.376 --> 1:21:14.676
- Really?
- Yes.

1:21:15.876 --> 1:21:16.976
Oh, Ulga...

1:21:17.076 --> 1:21:19.375
Ulga...

1:21:19.376 --> 1:21:20.376
Will you--

1:21:26.077 --> 1:21:27.877
What? What?

1:21:27.977 --> 1:21:32.576
- Marry me?
- Ohh...marry you?

1:21:32.577 --> 1:21:35.177
Oh, is legal question.

1:21:35.277 --> 1:21:39.877
Yes, I will, is binding answer.

1:21:47.078 --> 1:21:48.678
Leave me alone.

1:21:48.778 --> 1:21:50.077
I'm engaged!

1:21:50.078 --> 1:21:52.977
We're talking a settlement
of 20 million minimum!

1:21:52.978 --> 1:21:55.077
Oh, we're finally
set for life, Darling!

1:21:55.078 --> 1:21:57.578
I just have time
for one quickwhoo!

1:22:08.279 --> 1:22:11.379
- I said whoo.
- Why won't you talk to me?

1:22:12.979 --> 1:22:14.179
There's nothing to say.

1:22:14.279 --> 1:22:16.579
I scared you when I told you
I loved you, didn't I?

1:22:17.979 --> 1:22:20.179
Jack, there is no love.

1:22:20.279 --> 1:22:22.078
It's just a trick of
the brain...

1:22:22.079 --> 1:22:25.078
a combination of
hormones and chemicals.

1:22:25.079 --> 1:22:26.779
Then why are you here?

1:22:30.780 --> 1:22:32.579
Tell me to my face
you don't love me.

1:22:32.580 --> 1:22:34.279
I don't love you.

1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:38.480
Wow, that was more believable
than I thought it would be.

1:22:46.280 --> 1:22:49.580
Look, I know I freaked you out
by moving too fast...

1:22:49.681 --> 1:22:51.381
with all that
"I love you" stuff.

1:22:51.481 --> 1:22:54.081
So, let's just...

1:22:54.181 --> 1:22:55.281
get married.

1:22:57.481 --> 1:22:58.781
I gotta go.

1:23:10.282 --> 1:23:11.482
Oh!

1:23:12.882 --> 1:23:14.981
That is jarring.

1:23:14.982 --> 1:23:17.682
My love, tonight
we will celebrate...

1:23:17.782 --> 1:23:20.581
this ecstatic joining
of our spirits...

1:23:20.582 --> 1:23:21.882
with the union...

1:23:23.582 --> 1:23:26.082
of our aching bodies.

1:23:27.882 --> 1:23:30.381
Oh, you have
stomach cramp again.

1:23:30.382 --> 1:23:32.182
No, no, no. I ache
for you, my pumpkin.

1:23:32.283 --> 1:23:34.682
- Let's hump.
- Oh, William, my religion!

1:23:34.683 --> 1:23:37.582
- Humping is not yet allowed.
- Oh, of course it is.

1:23:37.583 --> 1:23:39.183
I proposed, you accepted.

1:23:39.283 --> 1:23:41.582
To God, everything
else is just paper work.

1:23:41.583 --> 1:23:45.282
Oh, William, I insist
we wait till after wedding.

1:23:45.283 --> 1:23:47.883
Ulga, I am much more
powerful than you.

1:23:47.983 --> 1:23:49.883
Just relax and enjoy it.

1:24:05.084 --> 1:24:08.184
Oh, always something
in your mouth.

1:24:12.084 --> 1:24:13.584
Are you dead?

1:24:28.785 --> 1:24:30.284
Why me?!

1:24:30.285 --> 1:24:33.485
Oh, wake up,
you disgusting shit!

1:24:34.986 --> 1:24:35.886
20 million.

1:24:39.786 --> 1:24:42.286
- What?
- I need you here.

1:24:48.086 --> 1:24:49.186
Wow.

1:24:49.286 --> 1:24:50.785
That's real attractive.

1:24:50.786 --> 1:24:51.886
We gotta get him out of here...

1:24:51.986 --> 1:24:54.186
and make it look like
he died at his house, alone.

1:24:55.287 --> 1:24:56.287
Room service.

1:24:59.187 --> 1:25:00.687
Let's get him to the bedroom.

1:25:03.087 --> 1:25:04.886
Ok...

1:25:04.887 --> 1:25:05.887
too far.

1:25:07.087 --> 1:25:08.587
Uh, balcony?

1:25:13.587 --> 1:25:14.686
Oh, just--

1:25:14.687 --> 1:25:16.887
just hold him.
I'll be right back.

1:25:26.288 --> 1:25:27.788
Champagne and oysters.

1:25:29.288 --> 1:25:30.188
All this just for you?

1:25:30.288 --> 1:25:31.387
Oh, yes.

1:25:31.388 --> 1:25:33.087
I mean, someone is joining me.

1:25:33.088 --> 1:25:34.087
I'll open the champagne.

1:25:34.088 --> 1:25:35.887
That's all right.
I'll take care of it.

1:25:35.888 --> 1:25:37.387
Thank you.
It's, uh...

1:25:37.389 --> 1:25:39.889
tip's included when
it's paid for, good night.

1:25:44.889 --> 1:25:46.389
Aah!

1:25:51.789 --> 1:25:53.588
I ask you to do
one simple thing.

1:25:53.589 --> 1:25:57.088
Oh, I don't consider holding
a 500-pound corpse simple.

1:25:57.089 --> 1:25:58.588
Ok, if you hadn't
flung open the door--

1:25:58.590 --> 1:26:00.190
I didn't fling it!

1:26:00.290 --> 1:26:02.589
Look, we just have to get
the body back to the house...

1:26:02.590 --> 1:26:04.190
and everything will be fine.

1:26:05.190 --> 1:26:06.489
Have you seen her?

1:26:06.490 --> 1:26:08.489
Dean.

1:26:08.490 --> 1:26:10.090
Shit!

1:26:10.190 --> 1:26:11.190
Angela!

1:26:11.290 --> 1:26:12.790
I'll meet you by Tensy
in 5 minutes.

1:26:12.890 --> 1:26:14.990
- He looks really pissed.
- I'll handle him. Go!

1:26:29.191 --> 1:26:30.191
Oh, god.

1:26:31.191 --> 1:26:32.591
Angela, stop!

1:26:37.591 --> 1:26:39.590
I have missed you
so much! So much!

1:26:39.591 --> 1:26:40.890
I can't stop
thinking about you.

1:26:40.892 --> 1:26:42.191
I've never been so
in love with anybody...

1:26:42.192 --> 1:26:43.292
in my whole, entire life.

1:26:43.392 --> 1:26:45.192
I'm begging you, please.

1:26:45.292 --> 1:26:46.391
Please, just give me
one more chance.

1:26:46.392 --> 1:26:49.391
One more chance.
Marry me again.

1:26:49.392 --> 1:26:50.891
What?

1:26:50.892 --> 1:26:52.492
Get up.

1:26:52.592 --> 1:26:54.192
How'd you find me?

1:26:54.292 --> 1:26:55.492
The title for
the Mercedes came through.

1:26:55.592 --> 1:26:56.791
It listed this place
as your temporary address.

1:26:56.792 --> 1:26:58.992
I drove straight through
just so I could see you.

1:26:59.092 --> 1:27:01.391
Your hair's different.
It looks really pretty.

1:27:01.392 --> 1:27:02.891
I like it.
Come here, give me a kiss.

1:27:02.893 --> 1:27:03.993
No.

1:27:04.093 --> 1:27:05.493
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Angela, I've changed.

1:27:05.593 --> 1:27:06.793
I've totally changed.

1:27:06.893 --> 1:27:07.793
Look, look, look.

1:27:07.893 --> 1:27:09.092
This place is crawling
with prime trim.

1:27:09.093 --> 1:27:10.292
I'm barely even noticing.

1:27:10.293 --> 1:27:12.493
I...can't deal
with this right now.

1:27:12.593 --> 1:27:13.993
No, no, no.
Angela, listen to me.

1:27:14.093 --> 1:27:15.392
I'm not leaving without you.

1:27:15.393 --> 1:27:16.493
I love you...

1:27:16.593 --> 1:27:17.993
and I don't care
who hears it.

1:27:18.093 --> 1:27:20.892
I love her. I love her.
I love her. I love her!

1:27:20.893 --> 1:27:21.892
What do you want
me to do?

1:27:21.893 --> 1:27:23.493
I--I'll sing.
You want me to sing?

1:27:23.594 --> 1:27:25.193
Come fly with me

1:27:25.194 --> 1:27:27.693
Come fly, come fly

1:27:27.694 --> 1:27:29.393
Shut up!

1:27:29.394 --> 1:27:31.694
What do you want, baby?
I'll do anything.

1:27:33.594 --> 1:27:34.594
Anything?

1:27:35.994 --> 1:27:38.594
I had no idea
you were into this stuff.

1:27:40.294 --> 1:27:44.494
I've been trying a lot
of new things lately.

1:27:44.595 --> 1:27:45.695
Oh, no, no.
Wait, wait.

1:27:45.795 --> 1:27:47.395
I don't know about that.

1:27:47.495 --> 1:27:50.195
Are you questioning me?

1:27:50.295 --> 1:27:52.695
No. No, no, no. It's just--

1:27:53.795 --> 1:27:56.295
Kiss my foot and apologize.

1:27:59.395 --> 1:28:00.395
I'm sorry.

1:28:01.895 --> 1:28:03.195
Good boy.

1:28:05.096 --> 1:28:07.896
Ooh, yes.

1:28:10.496 --> 1:28:16.696
Now, I'm just gonna
get some whipped cream.

1:28:18.996 --> 1:28:21.996
I got no problem with that.

1:28:22.796 --> 1:28:25.196
I'll be right back.

1:28:28.497 --> 1:28:29.497
Hurry up.

1:28:40.197 --> 1:28:43.096
Careful, we don't want
any more damage to the body.

1:28:43.097 --> 1:28:44.497
Yeah.

1:28:46.998 --> 1:28:47.997
Housekeeping!

1:28:47.998 --> 1:28:48.998
You want your bed
turned down?

1:28:50.998 --> 1:28:52.898
Housekeeping.

1:28:57.098 --> 1:28:58.897
Look. I don't need anything.

1:28:58.898 --> 1:29:00.198
Please, just get lost.

1:29:01.998 --> 1:29:03.998
Lady!

1:29:04.098 --> 1:29:05.897
You know,
I've been cleaning...

1:29:05.898 --> 1:29:09.097
this room for 3 weeks,
and so far, no tip.

1:29:09.099 --> 1:29:10.798
Fine. There's 20 bucks
in my pants over there.

1:29:10.799 --> 1:29:11.999
20?

1:29:12.099 --> 1:29:13.699
How about I sit
on your kinky face

1:29:13.799 --> 1:29:15.499
for a while... while
you think about that.

1:29:15.599 --> 1:29:18.599
OK, OK, OK. 50!

1:29:18.699 --> 1:29:20.499
That's more like it.

1:29:21.399 --> 1:29:22.999
Unbelievable.

1:29:27.399 --> 1:29:29.099
Both of these
wallets yours?

1:29:30.600 --> 1:29:32.500
Two wallets?

1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:33.500
Untie me.

1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:35.900
Now, that'll be another 20.

1:29:37.900 --> 1:29:41.399
All right.
He's sleeping.

1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:42.399
He wakes up having...

1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:44.099
one of his famous
coughing fits...

1:29:44.100 --> 1:29:46.900
flails around and falls
right onto the statue...

1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:49.099
becoming penilely impaled.

1:29:49.100 --> 1:29:50.900
That's believable, right?

1:29:51.001 --> 1:29:52.801
I just really need
a shower.

1:29:54.901 --> 1:29:55.900
Where's the penis?

1:29:55.901 --> 1:29:56.900
It's still there.

1:29:56.901 --> 1:29:57.900
It's just the rigor
mortis is gone...

1:29:57.901 --> 1:29:58.901
so there's no wood.

1:29:59.001 --> 1:30:01.300
Not his, the statue's.

1:30:01.301 --> 1:30:02.300
Oh. It's still
in the car.

1:30:02.301 --> 1:30:04.401
I'll get it.
There you go.

1:30:39.803 --> 1:30:41.903
Oh, this is--

1:30:43.003 --> 1:30:44.402
This is unbelievable.

1:30:44.403 --> 1:30:47.403
Oh. Oh, God.

1:30:49.603 --> 1:30:52.803
Oh, God.
You are so enormous.

1:30:52.903 --> 1:30:53.903
OK.

1:30:55.604 --> 1:30:57.104
Oh, God, please.

1:31:00.704 --> 1:31:02.603
You gold-digging whore.

1:31:02.604 --> 1:31:04.403
You're already working
someone else, huh?

1:31:04.404 --> 1:31:05.903
Get off of her, asshole.

1:31:05.904 --> 1:31:07.403
Get off, asshole.

1:31:07.404 --> 1:31:09.703
- Don't shoot him, Dean.
- Why not?

1:31:09.704 --> 1:31:11.204
Because he's already dead.

1:31:12.704 --> 1:31:15.004
Oh, you are one sick slut.

1:31:15.105 --> 1:31:18.305
I am not a sick slut.

1:31:18.405 --> 1:31:20.704
One penis coming up, mom.

1:31:20.705 --> 1:31:21.904
Wendy?

1:31:21.905 --> 1:31:23.905
Uh, hello.

1:31:26.305 --> 1:31:27.305
Mom?

1:31:29.505 --> 1:31:30.405
You're her mother?

1:31:30.505 --> 1:31:32.305
It's just a nickname.

1:31:32.405 --> 1:31:34.105
Oh, my God.

1:31:35.806 --> 1:31:38.105
Oh, my god.

1:31:38.106 --> 1:31:39.206
You two played me.

1:31:39.306 --> 1:31:41.706
Oh, no. No.

1:31:41.806 --> 1:31:44.206
That whole marriage
was bullshit...

1:31:44.306 --> 1:31:46.005
and this one you even offed!

1:31:46.006 --> 1:31:47.905
We didn't off him.

1:31:47.906 --> 1:31:50.906
He coughed himself
to death.

1:31:51.006 --> 1:31:51.906
Yeah, right.

1:31:52.006 --> 1:31:54.605
You let your
own daughter seduce me?

1:31:54.606 --> 1:31:55.605
Do you have any idea...

1:31:55.606 --> 1:31:57.205
how much therapy
you people need?

1:31:57.207 --> 1:31:59.406
Look, Dean.

1:31:59.407 --> 1:32:02.106
I don't blame you
for being upset.

1:32:02.107 --> 1:32:03.806
We did an awful thing.

1:32:03.807 --> 1:32:08.307
For the first time,
I feel really bad about it...

1:32:08.407 --> 1:32:12.206
but maybe, despite
all this craziness...

1:32:12.207 --> 1:32:14.807
there's still hope
for us after all?

1:32:14.907 --> 1:32:17.007
There's more hope for you
and him than there is for us.

1:32:17.107 --> 1:32:19.807
Dean, please
tell me it's OK.

1:32:19.908 --> 1:32:21.407
I love you.

1:32:21.408 --> 1:32:22.508
Forget it.

1:32:22.608 --> 1:32:23.607
Fine!

1:32:23.608 --> 1:32:25.307
Look. You brought
this on yourself.

1:32:25.308 --> 1:32:28.407
- You cheated on me.
- You set me up to cheat!

1:32:28.408 --> 1:32:29.508
We can't make a scumbag...

1:32:29.608 --> 1:32:31.207
do anything a scumbag
wouldn't do anyway.

1:32:31.208 --> 1:32:33.608
Shut up, junior slut.
Get over there.

1:32:35.208 --> 1:32:37.407
You know, you  two
got some brass balls...

1:32:37.408 --> 1:32:39.008
in those panties,
I'll give you that.

1:32:40.309 --> 1:32:43.509
In the few moments
you have left...

1:32:43.609 --> 1:32:47.508
Ii want to see some begging
and some pleading.

1:32:47.509 --> 1:32:50.208
Uh, Mom?

1:32:50.209 --> 1:32:54.608
Dean, you got so many tells.

1:32:54.609 --> 1:32:57.408
You are not the killing type.

1:32:57.409 --> 1:33:00.009
Don't screw with me.
I'm on a fine edge here.

1:33:00.110 --> 1:33:01.410
Don't!

1:33:04.110 --> 1:33:06.510
See? No bullets.

1:33:06.610 --> 1:33:09.310
Fine. So I'm not
that big on homicide...

1:33:09.410 --> 1:33:10.810
but I could do worse.

1:33:10.910 --> 1:33:14.209
I found all your I.D.s,
all your aliases...

1:33:14.210 --> 1:33:15.409
and I'm gonna
get them to the cops...

1:33:15.410 --> 1:33:18.010
when they start investigating
decomposing boy, here.

1:33:18.110 --> 1:33:21.110
You two are gonna dry up
in some filthy lesbo lockdown...

1:33:21.211 --> 1:33:22.711
with bad lighting!

1:33:24.011 --> 1:33:26.011
I don't have to kill you
to kill you.

1:33:26.111 --> 1:33:27.811
No.

1:33:27.911 --> 1:33:30.210
Dean, wait!

1:33:30.211 --> 1:33:32.411
Look. What if we gave
you back your money?

1:33:34.411 --> 1:33:35.811
Well?

1:33:37.111 --> 1:33:38.611
I stopped walking, didn't I?

1:33:38.711 --> 1:33:40.211
But first
you got to help us...

1:33:40.311 --> 1:33:42.211
make it look like
this creep died here...

1:33:42.312 --> 1:33:43.712
alone and peaceful...

1:33:43.812 --> 1:33:45.512
so there's no questions.

1:33:45.612 --> 1:33:46.712
You know how to do that?

1:33:46.812 --> 1:33:47.912
I'm from Jersey, aren't I?

1:33:50.612 --> 1:33:54.012
Boy, Dean was really
incredible with that body.

1:33:54.112 --> 1:33:57.811
Well, are you gonna
let me in on the play?

1:33:57.812 --> 1:33:58.911
What play?

1:33:58.912 --> 1:34:01.111
You promised
that mook 300,000.

1:34:01.112 --> 1:34:02.411
When we take him
to the bank tomorrow...

1:34:02.412 --> 1:34:06.011
we're only gonna be,
oh, about 300,000 short.

1:34:06.013 --> 1:34:08.612
- The money will be there.
- What?

1:34:08.613 --> 1:34:10.712
I don't want a big
scene about this, Page...

1:34:10.713 --> 1:34:13.012
but Mrs. Vogal from the I.R.S.

1:34:13.013 --> 1:34:15.613
Was more of a "protecting you
from making the worst mistake...

1:34:15.713 --> 1:34:17.012
of your life" thing
than it was...

1:34:17.013 --> 1:34:20.113
a "the government came
and took all our money" thing.

1:34:21.213 --> 1:34:24.212
- What?
- I pulled a tiny little con...

1:34:24.214 --> 1:34:25.713
to keep you from leaving.

1:34:25.714 --> 1:34:28.413
Oh, you bitch!
You bitch!

1:34:28.414 --> 1:34:30.713
Hey, look, wait!

1:34:30.714 --> 1:34:33.213
Stop it.
You're gonna kill us!

1:34:33.214 --> 1:34:34.414
Stop it!

1:34:37.614 --> 1:34:40.814
There seems to be a problem with
your account, Ms. Conners.

1:34:40.914 --> 1:34:42.814
It was closed yesterday.

1:34:42.914 --> 1:34:45.413
That's impossible.

1:34:45.415 --> 1:34:46.414
What the hell is going on?

1:34:46.415 --> 1:34:47.914
Nothing, I swear.

1:34:47.915 --> 1:34:49.715
Here's the signature.

1:34:53.215 --> 1:34:54.415
Barbara.

1:34:54.515 --> 1:34:57.515
Wait!

1:34:57.615 --> 1:35:00.115
I gave my old partner
all my account numbers...

1:35:00.215 --> 1:35:01.414
for the I.R.S. Scam...

1:35:01.415 --> 1:35:04.315
and that hag ripped off
every penny we ever stole!

1:35:04.415 --> 1:35:06.214
Tell your fairy tales
to your cellmates.

1:35:06.216 --> 1:35:08.515
Look. For once,
she's telling the truth.

1:35:08.516 --> 1:35:10.216
And I'm gonna believe
the seed of Satan?

1:35:10.316 --> 1:35:12.816
Skank, give me
the keys to my car.

1:35:12.916 --> 1:35:14.015
Give me the keys
to the Mercedes.

1:35:14.016 --> 1:35:16.016
That's it.
Good-bye.

1:35:18.916 --> 1:35:20.715
I can't believe it.

1:35:20.716 --> 1:35:21.815
I can't believe this.

1:35:21.816 --> 1:35:24.015
I've blown both our lives.

1:35:24.016 --> 1:35:26.016
I'm sorry, Page.

1:35:26.116 --> 1:35:27.815
I'm a terrible person.

1:35:27.817 --> 1:35:29.517
I'm a terrible mother.

1:35:31.917 --> 1:35:33.417
I'm a terrible everything.

1:35:42.917 --> 1:35:45.217
You're finally
seeing things clearly.

1:35:56.318 --> 1:35:57.518
What the hell
are you doing?

1:35:59.318 --> 1:36:00.218
You want money?

1:36:00.318 --> 1:36:03.818
The guy who wants to marry me is
worth 1.5 in a divorce.

1:36:28.219 --> 1:36:30.018
She's just gonna
screw with him again.

1:36:30.019 --> 1:36:31.419
Hugely.

1:36:32.920 --> 1:36:34.019
I'm sorry.
I was just wondering...

1:36:34.020 --> 1:36:35.919
how long you're
gonna stay this time.

1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:36.919
Look.

1:36:36.920 --> 1:36:38.519
I know that
I've been horrible...

1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:41.119
but all this talk
about love and marriage...

1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:44.319
it can make anyone act freaky.

1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:48.820
I know that I must seem
like a mean, selfish bitch...

1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:51.219
No, you seem like
the sweetest...

1:36:51.220 --> 1:36:53.520
most wonderful person
I've ever met.

1:36:54.621 --> 1:36:56.121
What a moron.

1:36:57.621 --> 1:36:59.220
Friends...

1:36:59.221 --> 1:37:00.720
employees...

1:37:00.721 --> 1:37:02.821
beer wholesaler...

1:37:02.921 --> 1:37:04.521
I have an announcement.

1:37:06.021 --> 1:37:08.121
Jane and I
are getting married.

1:37:10.421 --> 1:37:12.220
That is awesome!

1:37:12.221 --> 1:37:13.221
Yeah!

1:37:14.722 --> 1:37:16.421
Jane, come here.

1:37:16.422 --> 1:37:20.122
So, uh, Jack,
now that you have some, uh...

1:37:20.222 --> 1:37:22.221
extra responsibilities,
that doesn't mean...

1:37:22.222 --> 1:37:24.621
you're gonna change your mind
and sell this place, does it?

1:37:24.622 --> 1:37:26.622
No, we'll do just fine.

1:37:29.322 --> 1:37:30.322
Thanks, man.

1:37:33.022 --> 1:37:34.321
Sell what, honey?

1:37:34.323 --> 1:37:36.123
Oh, nothing.
Just some guys offered me...

1:37:36.223 --> 1:37:37.922
3 million for the bar
and the land.

1:37:37.923 --> 1:37:38.922
3 million?

1:37:38.923 --> 1:37:40.823
That sounds like something.

1:37:40.923 --> 1:37:43.822
Well, yeah,
but this place was my dad's.

1:37:43.823 --> 1:37:45.522
You know, it's home.

1:37:45.523 --> 1:37:46.522
It's too late, anyway.

1:37:46.523 --> 1:37:47.723
They got another lot
down the road.

1:37:53.923 --> 1:37:55.422
There's no money.
I'm bailing.

1:37:55.424 --> 1:37:56.523
No. Wait!
You can still get...

1:37:56.524 --> 1:37:58.323
a decent settlement
out of this guy.

1:37:58.324 --> 1:37:59.324
He'll lose the bar.

1:37:59.424 --> 1:38:00.924
This is wrong.
It's over.

1:38:01.024 --> 1:38:02.223
What the hell
is your daughter doing...

1:38:02.224 --> 1:38:03.523
growing a conscience
on my score?

1:38:03.524 --> 1:38:04.823
Don't make her do this.

1:38:04.824 --> 1:38:06.723
I'll figure a way
to get you your money.

1:38:06.724 --> 1:38:08.324
No. I'm tired of waiting.
We're doing it.

1:38:09.324 --> 1:38:11.823
May I have this dance?

1:38:11.824 --> 1:38:14.124
I--Jack.

1:38:15.124 --> 1:38:16.123
Uh-oh.

1:38:16.125 --> 1:38:18.625
- You gotta go.
- I gotta go.

1:38:24.525 --> 1:38:26.124
Is that who
I think it is?

1:38:26.125 --> 1:38:27.124
Jane!

1:38:27.125 --> 1:38:29.125
It is. How are you, darling?

1:38:29.225 --> 1:38:30.625
Pissed off.

1:38:30.725 --> 1:38:32.325
We were just on our way
to see you at the hotel...

1:38:32.425 --> 1:38:33.325
but we thought
we'd stop by here...

1:38:33.425 --> 1:38:34.325
for a drink.

1:38:34.425 --> 1:38:35.824
Hi.

1:38:35.825 --> 1:38:37.724
This isn't Jack, is it?

1:38:37.726 --> 1:38:40.225
Jane is always going
on and on about you.

1:38:40.226 --> 1:38:42.225
I think she's in love!

1:38:42.226 --> 1:38:44.826
I'm Betty,
Jane's second cousin...

1:38:44.926 --> 1:38:47.026
and this is my brother.

1:38:47.126 --> 1:38:49.025
Vinny--Vinny Staggliano.

1:38:49.026 --> 1:38:51.826
I'm afraid you caught us
at a weird time.

1:38:51.926 --> 1:38:54.225
I just asked Jane
to marry me, and--

1:38:54.226 --> 1:38:55.725
Oh! That's great!

1:38:55.726 --> 1:38:57.025
Congratulations.

1:38:57.026 --> 1:38:59.225
Actually, I think she's having
second thoughts.

1:38:59.227 --> 1:39:01.226
That's just the way our Jane is.

1:39:01.227 --> 1:39:02.526
Yeah, but she gets
over it, though...

1:39:02.527 --> 1:39:05.226
especially now that family's
here to give her a little shove.

1:39:05.227 --> 1:39:06.226
Come on, you two...

1:39:06.227 --> 1:39:07.327
why don't you
kiss and make up?

1:39:07.427 --> 1:39:10.027
- I'm not really in the mood.
- Go on. Kiss.

1:39:10.127 --> 1:39:12.827
That's nice.
There you go.

1:39:14.627 --> 1:39:16.926
I think your relatives
are gonna like Bill's boat.

1:39:16.927 --> 1:39:18.827
Who cares what they like?

1:39:18.927 --> 1:39:20.227
Nice boat.

1:39:24.928 --> 1:39:27.927
Ooh! Oh, oh!

1:39:27.928 --> 1:39:29.427
I'm so sorry.

1:39:29.428 --> 1:39:30.928
I'm so clumsy.

1:39:32.728 --> 1:39:33.828
That's OK.

1:39:35.028 --> 1:39:36.727
How you doing, Skippy?

1:39:36.728 --> 1:39:37.927
Hey.

1:39:37.928 --> 1:39:39.227
Hey, you.

1:39:39.228 --> 1:39:41.427
I got the lotion.

1:39:41.429 --> 1:39:43.328
Who's got the hands?

1:39:43.329 --> 1:39:44.529
Don't look at me.

1:39:44.629 --> 1:39:46.029
I don't like getting
all gunky.

1:39:46.129 --> 1:39:49.229
Jack, would you mind?

1:39:49.329 --> 1:39:50.229
Sure.

1:39:53.329 --> 1:39:57.229
You are the most kind,
wonderful man.

1:39:59.529 --> 1:40:01.429
Look at all the fish!

1:40:07.630 --> 1:40:09.029
Got it.

1:40:09.030 --> 1:40:10.330
This is gonna be a fun trip.

1:40:16.430 --> 1:40:17.729
I honestly don't know why...

1:40:17.730 --> 1:40:20.029
you'd want to wear
an off-the-shoulder.

1:40:20.030 --> 1:40:21.930
This is what I want,
and it looks fine.

1:40:22.030 --> 1:40:24.229
Fine.
What would I know?

1:40:24.231 --> 1:40:27.530
I've only been married
13 times.

1:40:27.531 --> 1:40:29.731
All right, I'm coming out.
You better be nice.

1:40:29.831 --> 1:40:31.531
I'm always nice.

1:40:40.831 --> 1:40:41.831
What's wrong?

1:40:44.232 --> 1:40:45.931
Nothing.

1:40:45.932 --> 1:40:48.231
Fine. If you're
gonna be sarcastic.

1:40:48.232 --> 1:40:50.732
I'm not being sarcastic.

1:40:52.932 --> 1:40:54.431
It's perfect.

1:40:54.432 --> 1:40:56.032
Really?

1:40:56.132 --> 1:40:58.132
There's nothing
you would change?

1:40:59.232 --> 1:41:00.831
Not a thing.

1:41:00.832 --> 1:41:02.631
Oh, my god.

1:41:02.632 --> 1:41:03.832
Well, I might just...

1:41:03.932 --> 1:41:06.832
see what it looks like
without this in here.

1:41:08.533 --> 1:41:09.733
I take it back.

1:41:11.033 --> 1:41:15.232
No. No.
I...like that idea.

1:41:15.233 --> 1:41:16.332
So...

1:41:16.333 --> 1:41:17.733
Mother likes it?

1:41:17.833 --> 1:41:20.333
- Oh, I'm not...
- she's not my mother.

1:41:40.734 --> 1:41:42.333
You really are good at this.

1:41:42.334 --> 1:41:43.833
I'm almost buying it.

1:41:43.834 --> 1:41:45.334
Ladies and gentlemen...

1:41:45.434 --> 1:41:47.233
friends and family...

1:41:47.235 --> 1:41:48.934
we have come here today...

1:41:48.935 --> 1:41:51.734
to celebrate
two wonderful people...

1:41:51.735 --> 1:41:53.934
who have managed
to find each other...

1:41:53.935 --> 1:41:57.234
in this sometimes
seemingly cold world...

1:41:57.235 --> 1:41:59.035
and pledge their hearts.

1:42:00.735 --> 1:42:02.735
Do you, Jack Withrowe...

1:42:02.835 --> 1:42:05.734
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife...

1:42:05.735 --> 1:42:08.334
to love her, honor her,
and cherish her...

1:42:08.336 --> 1:42:10.136
until death do you part?

1:42:10.236 --> 1:42:12.136
I do.

1:42:12.236 --> 1:42:14.736
And do you, Jane helstrom...

1:42:14.836 --> 1:42:17.836
take this man to be your
lawful wedded husband...

1:42:17.936 --> 1:42:20.536
to love, honor,
and to cherish him...

1:42:20.636 --> 1:42:23.336
until death do you part?

1:42:26.436 --> 1:42:28.136
I do.

1:42:29.137 --> 1:42:30.337
What?

1:42:33.237 --> 1:42:34.837
I do.

1:42:36.337 --> 1:42:38.537
I now pronounce you
husband and wife...

1:42:38.637 --> 1:42:40.037
and you may kiss the bride.

1:42:47.037 --> 1:42:49.036
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give to you...

1:42:49.037 --> 1:42:50.837
- Mr. And Mrs. Withrowe.
- Shut up.

1:42:52.038 --> 1:42:56.338
Wise men say

1:42:57.338 --> 1:43:02.238
Only fools rush in

1:43:04.138 --> 1:43:09.037
But I can't help

1:43:09.038 --> 1:43:14.838
Falling in love with you...

1:43:15.839 --> 1:43:16.838
Here.

1:43:16.839 --> 1:43:18.738
Make sure he sees
you drinking a lot.

1:43:18.739 --> 1:43:19.939
That won't be hard.

1:43:23.039 --> 1:43:26.438
There's my wonderful new
daughter-in-law.

1:43:26.439 --> 1:43:28.039
Are you avoiding me?

1:43:28.139 --> 1:43:29.339
Uh, no.

1:43:29.439 --> 1:43:31.339
I gotta go.

1:43:33.140 --> 1:43:34.640
Don't let it bother you.

1:43:34.740 --> 1:43:37.339
She's shyer than shit.

1:43:37.340 --> 1:43:40.640
Uh, what is it you do,
Mr. Staggliano?

1:43:42.140 --> 1:43:44.040
College professor.

1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:46.840
Uh, what do you teach?

1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:49.240
College stuff.

1:43:49.340 --> 1:43:51.439
What are you,
a fucking cop?

1:43:51.440 --> 1:43:53.840
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1:43:55.941 --> 1:43:57.740
I'll only need 30 minutes.

1:43:57.741 --> 1:44:00.441
It won't work.
He loves me too much.

1:44:00.541 --> 1:44:02.941
Men don't turn women down.

1:44:22.842 --> 1:44:25.742
Just like our first date,
only less mud.

1:44:25.842 --> 1:44:27.742
It's beautiful.

1:44:34.342 --> 1:44:35.442
Happy?

1:44:39.243 --> 1:44:41.443
Always know just
the right thing to say.

1:44:42.443 --> 1:44:44.142
I love you...

1:44:44.143 --> 1:44:45.243
Jack.

1:44:45.343 --> 1:44:48.643
I love you very much.

1:44:48.743 --> 1:44:50.742
You're different, aren't you?

1:44:50.743 --> 1:44:53.943
I mean, you would never let
anything ruin this, would you?

1:44:54.043 --> 1:44:57.543
Well, sometimes these hotel
soaps irritate my skin.

1:44:58.544 --> 1:45:00.244
I'm serious.

1:45:02.044 --> 1:45:05.044
Say nothing will ruin us.

1:45:06.044 --> 1:45:07.744
Nothing will ever
take me away...

1:45:07.844 --> 1:45:09.844
or keep me
from loving you.

1:45:20.045 --> 1:45:22.545
Can I have some water?

1:45:22.645 --> 1:45:24.345
I think I drank
too much champagne.

1:46:25.048 --> 1:46:27.347
What are you doing
out here alone?

1:46:27.348 --> 1:46:31.547
Oh, my wife celebrated herself
into an early coma.

1:46:31.548 --> 1:46:32.847
Oh.

1:46:32.848 --> 1:46:35.847
Well, her loss is my gain.

1:46:35.848 --> 1:46:37.547
Walk me to my room.

1:46:37.548 --> 1:46:39.047
I have a wedding gift
for you.

1:46:39.048 --> 1:46:40.847
Oh, no, that's ok.
I was just gonna--

1:46:40.848 --> 1:46:41.847
Oh, come on.

1:46:41.849 --> 1:46:44.348
You can't turn down
a wedding gift, you know.

1:46:44.349 --> 1:46:45.648
It's bad luck.

1:46:45.649 --> 1:46:47.649
- I never heard that.
- Sure.

1:46:47.749 --> 1:46:50.549
Everything to do with
weddings is bad luck.

1:46:57.349 --> 1:46:59.849
Uh, I can only stay
a minute.

1:47:00.849 --> 1:47:03.349
Will you just
relax?

1:47:03.450 --> 1:47:05.650
OK? Sit down.

1:47:09.150 --> 1:47:10.950
This hotel is so nice.

1:47:11.050 --> 1:47:12.750
I'm so glad
my brother and I

1:47:12.850 --> 1:47:14.450
decided to stay here, too.

1:47:14.550 --> 1:47:16.450
Uh...yeah.

1:47:16.550 --> 1:47:18.450
It's...

1:47:18.550 --> 1:47:21.650
you, uh--ahem--mentioned
something about a gift?

1:47:24.151 --> 1:47:26.950
You're so greedy.

1:47:26.951 --> 1:47:31.551
But I happen to have it
right...here.

1:47:35.551 --> 1:47:38.650
Cognac! Huh! Wow!

1:47:38.651 --> 1:47:41.150
80 years old.

1:47:41.151 --> 1:47:42.451
Uh, Jane is gonna love this.

1:47:42.551 --> 1:47:43.850
Thank you so much.

1:47:43.851 --> 1:47:46.751
Oh, oh, oh--
can't we just try some?

1:47:46.852 --> 1:47:48.552
Please?

1:47:55.752 --> 1:47:58.052
I thought you might not
want to wait alone.

1:48:00.252 --> 1:48:02.351
Could be wrong. Oh!

1:48:02.352 --> 1:48:04.552
It feels good going down,
doesn't it?

1:48:04.652 --> 1:48:07.852
It's, uh...
it's really good.

1:48:21.153 --> 1:48:22.753
No, thanks. I, uh...

1:48:22.853 --> 1:48:24.452
I should be
getting back to Jane.

1:48:24.453 --> 1:48:26.652
Jack, she's asleep.

1:48:26.653 --> 1:48:28.253
OK? Come on.

1:48:28.354 --> 1:48:29.653
You deserve to have...

1:48:29.654 --> 1:48:31.953
a little bit of fun
on your wedding night.

1:48:31.954 --> 1:48:33.654
It's just fruit.

1:48:41.754 --> 1:48:43.254
It's just a waste of time.

1:48:43.354 --> 1:48:46.353
He's just gonna throw her out
on her ass.

1:48:46.354 --> 1:48:48.054
I'm not worried.

1:48:48.155 --> 1:48:50.855
Is that why you're
melting down the remote?

1:48:53.555 --> 1:48:55.055
Cute.

1:49:07.055 --> 1:49:09.655
You've got a tiny bit
of cream...

1:49:11.256 --> 1:49:12.556
right...

1:49:24.456 --> 1:49:27.555
- I got to go.
- Oh, oh, oh. Why?

1:49:27.556 --> 1:49:29.855
- I just can't do this.
- What's the matter?

1:49:29.856 --> 1:49:34.656
Is it because you don't
find me attractive?

1:49:34.757 --> 1:49:38.556
No, no. A part of me
is very, very interested...

1:49:38.557 --> 1:49:40.356
but the other parts
are yelling...

1:49:40.357 --> 1:49:42.056
"You just married her cousin."

1:49:42.057 --> 1:49:44.657
Jane would never know,
I promise.

1:49:44.757 --> 1:49:46.556
Yeah, but I would.

1:49:46.557 --> 1:49:50.257
I could never do that
to someone I love.

1:49:53.558 --> 1:49:55.857
You really do love her,
don't you?

1:49:55.858 --> 1:49:57.557
Yeah...

1:49:57.558 --> 1:50:00.057
and I really should be
getting back.

1:50:00.058 --> 1:50:02.057
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

1:50:02.058 --> 1:50:03.958
I feel terrible.
Please don't leave like this.

1:50:04.058 --> 1:50:05.658
Can't we just, you know...

1:50:05.758 --> 1:50:08.158
have a make-up drink
or something?

1:50:08.258 --> 1:50:10.258
I'll be good, I promise.

1:50:12.559 --> 1:50:13.659
Please?

1:50:21.759 --> 1:50:23.659
That's it.
I'm going over there.

1:50:23.759 --> 1:50:25.058
No. It isn't time yet.

1:50:25.059 --> 1:50:26.358
I don't care,
you sick shit.

1:50:26.359 --> 1:50:27.958
I can't do this to him.

1:50:27.959 --> 1:50:29.159
You see? It hurts
when you screw around...

1:50:29.259 --> 1:50:30.458
with people's feelings,
doesn't it?

1:50:30.459 --> 1:50:31.859
Not as much as this.

1:50:43.460 --> 1:50:44.860
Oh, my God.

1:50:44.960 --> 1:50:46.859
Jane!

1:50:46.860 --> 1:50:48.060
What?

1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:51.560
I'm sorry.

1:50:57.461 --> 1:50:59.260
While we are willing to admit...

1:50:59.261 --> 1:51:02.260
some wrongdoing on
the part of my client...

1:51:02.261 --> 1:51:05.360
given the extremely short
duration of the marriage--

1:51:05.361 --> 1:51:06.461
No negotiation.

1:51:06.561 --> 1:51:08.661
Give her whatever she wants.

1:51:10.261 --> 1:51:12.360
We talked about
you not saying that.

1:51:12.361 --> 1:51:14.461
Give her
whatever she wants.

1:51:24.862 --> 1:51:26.462
I don't know what happened.

1:51:26.562 --> 1:51:27.861
It was weird.

1:51:27.862 --> 1:51:29.862
There is only one man
in the world.

1:51:42.563 --> 1:51:44.862
What the hell
is taking so long?

1:51:44.863 --> 1:51:46.862
Oh, relax.
You'll get your money.

1:51:46.863 --> 1:51:49.562
You destroyed my daughter,
but you'll get it.

1:51:49.563 --> 1:51:52.163
Hey, I was standing around
minding my own business...

1:51:52.263 --> 1:51:54.163
when you bitches came along
and ripped out my heart...

1:51:54.263 --> 1:51:55.562
for a game of hacky sack.

1:51:55.563 --> 1:51:57.263
- Don't give me that.
- Come off it.

1:51:57.363 --> 1:51:59.862
We're both the same--scum.

1:51:59.864 --> 1:52:01.563
We are not the same.

1:52:01.564 --> 1:52:04.463
I wasn't lying
when I said "I do."

1:52:04.464 --> 1:52:07.363
No, you were lying
when you tried to nail Page.

1:52:07.364 --> 1:52:10.964
Look. Where I come from,
guys make mistakes sometimes.

1:52:11.064 --> 1:52:13.664
Didn't change the fact
that I loved you.

1:52:15.864 --> 1:52:17.763
I just know
I wouldn't do it again.

1:52:17.764 --> 1:52:22.064
- Because you got caught.
- No, because of what I lost.

1:52:23.165 --> 1:52:26.065
I'm not the only guy in the
world that's ever screwed up.

1:52:26.765 --> 1:52:28.064
Even a goody-goody like Jack

1:52:28.065 --> 1:52:30.064
can't keep his wang
in the hangar.

1:52:30.065 --> 1:52:32.964
- Yes, he can.
- What did you say?

1:52:32.965 --> 1:52:34.064
Nothing.

1:52:34.065 --> 1:52:35.364
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1:52:35.365 --> 1:52:36.865
What did you say?

1:52:38.065 --> 1:52:39.565
I micked him.

1:52:40.866 --> 1:52:42.365
Stryctotoxy...

1:52:42.366 --> 1:52:44.065
somewhere
bet ween out and awake.

1:52:44.066 --> 1:52:45.166
It just makes people
easy to handle.

1:52:45.266 --> 1:52:47.165
Whoa. Wait a minute.
You're kidding.

1:52:47.166 --> 1:52:49.866
He said no, and you still
let her believe...

1:52:49.966 --> 1:52:51.166
that he went for a soil sample?

1:52:51.266 --> 1:52:53.865
You know what?
That's a new low, even for you.

1:52:53.866 --> 1:52:55.866
Look. You wanted your money.

1:52:55.966 --> 1:52:57.466
What was I supposed to do...

1:52:57.566 --> 1:52:59.565
tell her the man
you forced us to con...

1:52:59.566 --> 1:53:01.565
was the only decent guy
she ever met?

1:53:01.567 --> 1:53:03.267
But you know what?
This is just too sick.

1:53:03.367 --> 1:53:05.366
I thought this whole revenge
thing was gonna be fun...

1:53:05.367 --> 1:53:07.267
but you've done everything
you can to ruin it.

1:53:07.367 --> 1:53:08.766
I don't even want
this guy's money now.

1:53:08.767 --> 1:53:10.766
- Well, I don't want it, either.
- Well, I'm not taking it!

1:53:10.767 --> 1:53:12.766
- Well, neither am I!
- Well, neither am I!

1:53:12.767 --> 1:53:14.667
- I'll take it.
- What?!

1:53:14.767 --> 1:53:15.966
You said
you didn't want it.

1:53:15.967 --> 1:53:17.867
You should tell
your daughter the truth.

1:53:17.967 --> 1:53:20.967
What for? He's only gonna
end up hurting her anyway.

1:53:21.067 --> 1:53:23.366
She's better off with me, OK?

1:53:23.368 --> 1:53:24.468
I'll protect her.

1:53:24.568 --> 1:53:26.667
From what?
From love?

1:53:26.668 --> 1:53:27.968
From pain.

1:53:28.068 --> 1:53:29.968
Love is pain.
Life is pain.

1:53:30.068 --> 1:53:31.968
You can't protect
anybody from it.

1:53:32.068 --> 1:53:33.667
It's always gonna get you.

1:53:33.668 --> 1:53:35.768
But sometimes,
life can also be good.

1:53:35.868 --> 1:53:38.167
But you got to be open.
You got to take chances.

1:53:38.168 --> 1:53:39.768
You got to let go.

1:53:39.868 --> 1:53:42.167
What self-help guru moron
taught you that?

1:53:42.168 --> 1:53:43.968
Nobody had
to teach me nothing.

1:53:44.069 --> 1:53:45.169
It's common sense.

1:53:45.269 --> 1:53:46.968
And Deepak Chopra
is not a moron.

1:53:46.969 --> 1:53:48.969
I've seen a lot
of crap in my life...

1:53:49.069 --> 1:53:50.969
but the way you're cheating
her out of any chance...

1:53:51.069 --> 1:53:53.169
for a decent future
really sucks.

1:53:54.069 --> 1:53:55.569
Of all the lousy things
you've done...

1:53:55.669 --> 1:53:57.569
you should be most
ashamed of that.

1:53:57.669 --> 1:53:58.869
And what you did to me, too--

1:53:58.969 --> 1:54:01.169
I don't want to completely
leave that out.

1:54:01.869 --> 1:54:03.368
- Here's your money.
- I don't want the money.

1:54:03.369 --> 1:54:05.368
Good luck with
psycho mom here.

1:54:05.370 --> 1:54:07.770
- What was that?
- I took care of it.

1:54:07.870 --> 1:54:10.270
- How?
- I don't want to talk about it.

1:54:10.370 --> 1:54:11.870
Let's just get out
of this goddamn place.

1:54:12.970 --> 1:54:14.069
So...

1:54:14.070 --> 1:54:17.070
where are we going--
Seattle or San Francisco?

1:54:18.170 --> 1:54:20.169
You know, you don't
have to stay with me.

1:54:20.170 --> 1:54:23.169
There's plenty of money for
you to set up on your own...

1:54:23.170 --> 1:54:24.669
and you can have
all of it.

1:54:24.670 --> 1:54:26.469
Thanks, mom.

1:54:26.471 --> 1:54:28.470
You're the only person
in this world...

1:54:28.471 --> 1:54:29.871
I even half-trust.

1:54:36.771 --> 1:54:39.070
- What are you doing?
- Turning around.

1:54:39.071 --> 1:54:40.071
Why?

1:54:41.971 --> 1:54:44.371
- Promise you won't attack me?
- What is it?

1:54:44.471 --> 1:54:45.870
We're traveling
at high speeds.

1:54:45.871 --> 1:54:47.270
It would endanger
both our lives.

1:54:47.272 --> 1:54:48.572
What is it?

1:54:51.172 --> 1:54:54.171
Jack turned me down...

1:54:54.172 --> 1:54:58.672
so I kind of...
I micked him.

1:55:08.373 --> 1:55:11.472
Oh, you are the most evil,
manipulative--

1:55:11.473 --> 1:55:13.773
You're right. I am.

1:55:13.873 --> 1:55:16.472
I've just been so afraid
of losing you...

1:55:16.473 --> 1:55:18.773
or of you getting hurt
like me.

1:55:18.873 --> 1:55:20.472
But I can't protect you.

1:55:20.473 --> 1:55:23.472
I just get you hurt
in different, sickways.

1:55:23.473 --> 1:55:25.172
So you might as well get hurt...

1:55:25.173 --> 1:55:27.172
in your own healthy,
normal ways--

1:55:27.173 --> 1:55:28.773
ways you come up with
on your own...

1:55:28.874 --> 1:55:30.874
and can't blame me for.

1:55:40.674 --> 1:55:44.374
Oh, it's a hug.
I can pull over for a hug.

1:55:52.175 --> 1:55:53.975
Now, don't cry too much.
You'll look like hell...

1:55:54.075 --> 1:55:55.975
when you go back to him, OK?

1:55:56.075 --> 1:55:58.274
You should wear
the blue dress.

1:55:58.275 --> 1:56:00.275
Mom...

1:56:01.375 --> 1:56:03.975
Right.
Wear whatever you want...

1:56:05.475 --> 1:56:07.375
except what you're wearing.

1:56:22.476 --> 1:56:23.976
What are you doing here?

1:56:24.076 --> 1:56:26.376
You know what I'm doing here.

1:56:26.476 --> 1:56:27.776
What, you thought
I'd still want you...

1:56:27.876 --> 1:56:28.776
after what you did to me?

1:56:28.876 --> 1:56:30.676
You don't? OK. Fine.

1:56:30.776 --> 1:56:33.276
All right, wait, wait.
OK. OK. Fine.

1:56:33.377 --> 1:56:37.177
- So I still want you.
- No kidding.

1:56:40.477 --> 1:56:43.176
But don't you ever
cheat on me again.

1:56:43.177 --> 1:56:45.776
- Ever. Ever!
- OK. Fine!

1:56:45.777 --> 1:56:46.776
I mean it.

1:56:46.777 --> 1:56:47.777
Because if one day...

1:56:47.877 --> 1:56:49.277
you happen to notice
some gorgeous girl

1:56:49.377 --> 1:56:51.176
giving you that
"Let's screw around" look...

1:56:51.177 --> 1:56:55.477
just remember,
she may be working for me.

1:56:56.878 --> 1:56:57.978
All right. Fine.

1:56:58.078 --> 1:56:59.277
But you?

1:56:59.278 --> 1:57:01.978
No more conning.
No more.

1:57:02.078 --> 1:57:03.477
If you're gonna be my wife...

1:57:03.478 --> 1:57:05.078
you've got to live
a respectable life...

1:57:05.178 --> 1:57:06.778
chopping cars.

1:57:08.478 --> 1:57:10.577
First you got to help me
with one thing.

1:57:10.578 --> 1:57:12.478
Well, first you got
to help me with one thing.

1:57:27.179 --> 1:57:29.979
You're not gonna fall asleep
on me again, are you?

1:57:30.079 --> 1:57:31.979
I feel pretty good
about tonight.

1:57:43.280 --> 1:57:44.980
Look. I don't
want to go in there.

1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:46.279
The bank owns it now.

1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:47.780
There's still some stuff
they said you left.

1:57:47.880 --> 1:57:49.480
I cleared out everything.

1:57:58.481 --> 1:58:00.481
Surprise!

1:58:35.082 --> 1:58:38.982
- How?
- My name is Page.

1:58:55.483 --> 1:58:57.783
I never realized
I could feel this way again...

1:58:57.883 --> 1:59:00.683
that I could be so totally
in love with someone.

1:59:02.484 --> 1:59:04.884
I feel the same way, Stanley.

1:59:09.584 --> 1:59:12.384
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.
