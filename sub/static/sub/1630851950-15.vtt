WEBVTT

00:11.241 --> 00:12.517
- Previously on
The Oval...

00:12.517 --> 00:16.068
That low-down
dirty bitch is evil.

00:16.068 --> 00:17.482
We will take her down.

00:17.482 --> 00:20.034
- Wait until Donald
finds out about this.

00:20.034 --> 00:21.413
- You're awfully comfortable
with him.

00:21.413 --> 00:23.413
- That's because I'm -- him.
- Damn, he looks bad.

00:23.413 --> 00:25.931
- Why don't you
head on back to the White House.

00:25.931 --> 00:27.551
- I have to pretend to be
really concerned.

00:27.551 --> 00:30.517
- I should have shot you.
- I'm staying in my house.

00:30.517 --> 00:33.103
- We'll just see how great
your training really is.

00:33.103 --> 00:34.586
- My girlfriend, she was
taken.

00:34.586 --> 00:36.448
- I was told that you were
talking about the President.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.344
What are you doing, man?

00:43.344 --> 00:45.586
- I'm not going to tell you
to be quiet again.

00:45.586 --> 00:47.896
- I know my rights.
This isn't legal.

00:47.896 --> 00:49.137
- Well okay...
- No!

00:49.137 --> 00:51.448
No!

00:51.448 --> 00:53.172
- Tell me what you know.
Hmm?

00:53.172 --> 00:55.068
- I don't know what you're
talking about.

00:55.068 --> 00:59.000
- Tell me about your girlfriend.
- What?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.379
- Just tell me what
happened.

01:01.379 --> 01:03.310
- Man, what do you got
the gloves on for?

01:03.310 --> 01:05.068
Why are you panicking?

01:05.068 --> 01:07.000
I just wanted to...

01:07.000 --> 01:08.931
- Hmm, to what?
To what? Tell me!

01:08.931 --> 01:11.862
I didn't do anything wrong!

01:11.862 --> 01:14.275
I know that.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.241
Alright, so let me leave.

01:19.034 --> 01:20.931
But why are you here?

01:20.931 --> 01:23.172
Uh, I, uh....

01:23.172 --> 01:27.517
- Come on, son.
I don't have all night!

01:27.517 --> 01:29.862
- I don't want to talk to you
about this.

01:29.862 --> 01:31.931
- You don't want to talk to me.
- I just...

01:31.931 --> 01:34.344
- No, no, no, no, no!
You do want to talk about it!

01:34.344 --> 01:36.965
- I don't want to talk, I
don't want to talk about it.

01:36.965 --> 01:39.241
- Okay, okay. Well then, well
then you have to come with me.

01:39.241 --> 01:40.551
- Wait, why?
Why?!

01:40.551 --> 01:43.000
- You have to go
see the officer. Hmm?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Alright, hey, hey.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.551
This was a mistake.

01:46.551 --> 01:48.482
- So your girlfriend didn't go
see the President?

01:48.482 --> 01:52.206
- No, no she didn't.
I was, I was smoking.

01:52.206 --> 01:57.103
- Smoking what?
- I was, I was smoking weed.

01:57.103 --> 02:00.206
- And that makes you delusional?
- No. Yeah! Yes.

02:00.206 --> 02:01.551
- No?
- No.

02:01.551 --> 02:03.482
- Which is it?
- It's, I, look...

02:03.482 --> 02:06.241
I just want to go home.
Alright?

02:06.241 --> 02:10.275
- Is that where she is, hmm?
At your house?

02:10.275 --> 02:12.275
No, no not at all.

02:27.137 --> 02:28.551
- Ladies and
gentlemen,

02:28.551 --> 02:30.413
the President and the
First Lady.

02:57.172 --> 02:59.517
Are you serious, Sam?

02:59.517 --> 03:02.620
Yes.

03:02.620 --> 03:05.000
- You can't keep me down
here.

03:07.413 --> 03:09.344
It's happening.

03:12.620 --> 03:18.241
- Look, I got to take my
medication.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.413
You are not on medication.

03:19.413 --> 03:21.034
Yeah, no, I am.

03:21.034 --> 03:25.379
And if I don't take it,
then I'm gonna die down here.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.068
That's not in your file.

03:29.344 --> 03:33.793
Look, you have no idea

03:33.793 --> 03:35.793
what you're getting yourself
into.

03:35.793 --> 03:40.275
- Kyle, you know how this
works.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.068
Just let me out of here,
Sam.

03:46.068 --> 03:49.379
Not happening.

03:49.379 --> 03:51.413
- You don't think
they're looking for me?

03:51.413 --> 03:56.586
- And who would that be,
the Chief of Staff?

03:56.586 --> 03:59.103
Yes.

03:59.103 --> 04:01.655
He hasn't said a thing.

04:01.655 --> 04:05.689
Well, I'm sure that he is.

04:05.689 --> 04:10.689
- Well, then, you should eat
something.

04:10.689 --> 04:16.448
- No, no, I need my meds,
Sam, or I'm gonna die in here.

04:16.448 --> 04:21.034
- You still haven't told me
what your meds are.

04:21.034 --> 04:24.103
- Okay, okay, all right.
- So enjoy your night.

04:24.103 --> 04:27.379
- Are you kidding me, Sam?
- No, you're in here.

04:27.379 --> 04:29.379
Dammit Sam.

04:29.379 --> 04:31.586
I'm sorry, buddy.

04:31.586 --> 04:35.551
- So, how long are you
gonna keep me here?

04:39.344 --> 04:41.000
As long as it takes.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.620
Yeah, okay.

04:45.482 --> 04:47.068
Enjoy your night.

04:47.068 --> 04:51.103
- You are really screwing up
big time on this one, Sam.

04:51.103 --> 04:53.275
Chance I'll take.

04:53.275 --> 04:55.137
Well, we'll see.

05:06.413 --> 05:08.275
Really?

05:08.275 --> 05:11.068
- What?
- You're having a drink?

05:11.068 --> 05:13.206
I thought you were asleep.

05:13.206 --> 05:17.172
- How am I going to sleep
when the man that I love

05:17.172 --> 05:18.931
isn't right next to me?

05:23.620 --> 05:26.931
- I love you.
- I love you too.

05:26.931 --> 05:28.448
Give me that.

05:28.448 --> 05:32.103
- It's strong.
- After the day we've had?

05:32.103 --> 05:36.034
Yeah, you're right.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.206
You still getting calls?

05:39.206 --> 05:41.482
- Nah, I turned the phone
off.

05:41.482 --> 05:43.896
- Honey, it's going to be
okay.

05:47.310 --> 05:49.413
Did we do the right thing?

05:49.413 --> 05:51.172
Of course we did.

05:51.172 --> 05:54.137
It's for the good of the
country.

05:54.137 --> 05:57.413
- You do understand how
hard they're gonna come at us.

05:57.413 --> 05:59.655
Yes, I do.

05:59.655 --> 06:02.689
And that won't go well
for them, now will it?

06:02.689 --> 06:04.586
Because they're definitely
gonna underestimate

06:04.586 --> 06:07.379
how hard we're gonna
hit back.

06:07.379 --> 06:09.241
Hmm?

06:09.241 --> 06:11.000
I hope you're right.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
- Please, we have the
mattress,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.068
we have the witnesses,
what more do we need?

06:16.068 --> 06:18.862
- Okay, then tomorrow,
when I meet with the party,

06:18.862 --> 06:21.413
let's hope they don't turn
on me.

06:21.413 --> 06:23.448
- Now why would they do
that?

06:23.448 --> 06:25.517
Their son.

06:25.517 --> 06:27.586
You know what?

06:27.586 --> 06:29.551
I've been thinking about that.

06:29.551 --> 06:32.344
Thinking about what?

06:32.344 --> 06:36.551
- How far do you think she
would go to protect them?

06:36.551 --> 06:38.000
- Simone...
- No, no, no, no.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.344
Think about it, okay.
Would she use him?

06:41.344 --> 06:43.206
Hmm?

06:43.206 --> 06:46.034
- We would get murdered for
floating something like that.

06:46.034 --> 06:48.620
- You know what? I think
that we should get the FBI

06:48.620 --> 06:51.137
to put full-time security on
him.

06:51.137 --> 06:53.034
- You really think that they
would do something?

06:53.034 --> 06:57.068
- Oh, please. They're animals,
they eat their young.

06:57.068 --> 06:59.482
- Okay, how would that
play if we're insisting

06:59.482 --> 07:03.034
that they can't see their
own son?

07:03.034 --> 07:07.310
- Hunter Franklin is not
above the law.

07:07.310 --> 07:08.724
I know that.

07:08.724 --> 07:10.620
- Okay, and then we'll find
out a way

07:10.620 --> 07:15.620
to float it to the press as
well.

07:15.620 --> 07:17.517
He's not doing too good.

07:17.517 --> 07:20.068
What if he doesn't make it?

07:20.068 --> 07:23.586
- But if he does, he'll be
another witness for us

07:23.586 --> 07:25.551
to tell the truth.

07:25.551 --> 07:27.379
Yeah.

07:27.379 --> 07:29.586
- Mmhmm.
Oh, oh, and wait.

07:29.586 --> 07:33.103
Where exactly is their
daughter, hmm?

07:33.103 --> 07:35.275
- We still don't know.
- Right, nobody has seen her.

07:35.275 --> 07:38.448
Yeah.

07:38.448 --> 07:40.724
- Right.
- You know what? I think that--

07:40.724 --> 07:45.517
- No, no, no, I think that
if we find her,

07:45.517 --> 07:48.137
we'll have another witness.

07:48.137 --> 07:52.379
- You really feel that--
- Have I ever been wrong? Hmm?

07:52.379 --> 07:54.034
- Well...
- No, no, no, no.

07:54.034 --> 07:57.241
- Not about them.

07:57.241 --> 08:01.137
No, you have not.

08:01.137 --> 08:05.310
- Okay, so we're just gonna
have to figure this out.

08:07.448 --> 08:09.137
Okay, yeah.

08:09.137 --> 08:11.068
Tell you what, first thing in
the morning

08:11.068 --> 08:13.103
I'll look into how we can
find her.

08:13.103 --> 08:15.034
Hmm.

08:15.034 --> 08:17.379
You know, that's gonna be
the tricky part.

08:17.379 --> 08:20.620
Yeah, I know.

08:20.620 --> 08:25.034
- Well, now that we have
that settled

08:25.034 --> 08:26.931
you can finally get some
rest

08:26.931 --> 08:29.482
'cause there's nothing you
can do tonight.

08:29.482 --> 08:32.379
- And you can come to bed.
- Yes, dear.

08:41.724 --> 08:43.379
- So your ass just won't leave!
- Priscilla--

08:43.379 --> 08:45.344
- No, no, no, you're wanna
keep disrespecting me?

08:45.344 --> 08:47.448
- Put the pot down.
- I'm not putting the pot down.

08:47.448 --> 08:49.655
- Sam, get out of my house!
- Priscilla, I'm sorry.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.275
- To hell with your damn
sorry, Sam!

08:51.275 --> 08:53.965
- Can you just put the pot down?
- I'm not putting the pot down.

08:53.965 --> 08:56.206
If I put it down, it's gonna
be on your ass.

08:56.206 --> 09:00.034
- Priscilla...
- Sam, get out of my house!

09:00.034 --> 09:01.931
- Are you really gonna do
this to me?

09:01.931 --> 09:03.655
Oh, you damn right.

09:03.655 --> 09:05.551
Priscilla, I love you.

09:05.551 --> 09:07.413
You know what you love, Sam?

09:07.413 --> 09:10.034
Is making me crazy!

09:10.034 --> 09:11.620
Priscilla, I'm so sorry.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.379
- To hell with your damn
sorry!

09:13.379 --> 09:17.586
- Get out of my house!
- Okay, okay, okay.

09:17.586 --> 09:20.517
- Can you just put the pot down?
- Not until you leave.

09:20.517 --> 09:22.413
Okay, let me get my things.

09:22.413 --> 09:24.724
- Get your things.
- Can I just tell you--

09:24.724 --> 09:27.241
- And why are you already
dressed anyway, hmm?

09:27.241 --> 09:30.068
'Cause you knew I was
gonna come in here.

09:30.068 --> 09:32.068
- You knew I was coming in here.
- Please.

09:32.068 --> 09:33.931
- So then get your shit and
get out.

09:33.931 --> 09:35.413
- Okay, Priscilla.
- Now!

09:35.413 --> 09:39.000
- Okay! But can I just tell you
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
- Oh please, Sam.
- I don't know what got into me.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.758
Okay, I don't know what
I was thinking.

09:42.758 --> 09:45.758
- Just get out!
- Okay, okay, Priscilla.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.379
Get out of here.

10:08.689 --> 10:11.724
Sam, Sam, let me go!
Sam, let me go.

10:11.724 --> 10:14.965
- I love you.
- Let me go. Let me go, Sam.

10:14.965 --> 10:17.068
- I'm so sorry.
I'm just so sorry.

10:22.344 --> 10:27.620
- I shouldn't have hurt you,
you didn't deserve that, baby.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.413
- Why did you do that to
me?

10:32.586 --> 10:36.241
I don't know.

10:36.241 --> 10:39.758
- Was I, was I that bad of
a wife?

10:43.586 --> 10:47.689
- No, no, no, no, this was
me. This was all me, baby.

10:47.689 --> 10:50.965
- This was all me.
- I just want you to leave.

10:50.965 --> 10:52.724
I just, I can't even look
at you.

10:52.724 --> 10:56.655
I just need you to leave.

10:56.655 --> 11:00.758
- Will you please hear me
out?

11:00.758 --> 11:02.482
- You're still not respecting
my wishes.

11:02.482 --> 11:06.172
- Okay, okay.
- It's not about you, Sam.

11:06.172 --> 11:09.551
- Can you please just leave?!
- Okay, yeah. Look, I'll leave.

11:09.551 --> 11:11.379
Then do it.

11:11.379 --> 11:14.344
- But I need you to know that
I love you and I will always...

11:14.344 --> 11:16.689
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't care. I don't care.

11:16.689 --> 11:19.344
- I'm so sorry, Priscilla.
- I don't care. I don't care.

11:19.344 --> 11:20.482
Right.

11:23.206 --> 11:26.241
- Just go.
- Priscilla, please...

11:26.241 --> 11:30.275
Let's just take some time
off, see a counselor.

11:30.275 --> 11:32.206
Please.

11:32.206 --> 11:37.275
- Oh, now you want to go
see a counselor?

11:37.275 --> 11:39.482
Baby.

11:39.482 --> 11:43.448
- Sam, get out of my
house.

11:43.448 --> 11:44.827
Okay, Priscilla.

11:57.482 --> 11:59.310
Oh my God.

12:02.206 --> 12:05.724
Shit.

12:05.724 --> 12:10.689
- What?
- How long have I been here?

12:10.689 --> 12:12.379
45 minutes.

12:14.758 --> 12:17.551
Is it too soon to leave?

12:17.551 --> 12:19.551
What?

12:19.551 --> 12:21.896
Is it too soon to leave?

12:21.896 --> 12:23.482
The press is here.

12:23.482 --> 12:27.275
I know you don't give a shit.

12:27.275 --> 12:30.724
- Not after the performance
I gave today.

12:30.724 --> 12:33.586
That was pretty good.

12:33.586 --> 12:37.241
Wait, is that a compliment?

12:37.241 --> 12:40.206
- You know you can be
wicked.

12:40.206 --> 12:43.034
Is that a compliment?

12:43.034 --> 12:45.586
- Just giving the devil her
due.

12:45.586 --> 12:49.965
Said the devil himself.

12:49.965 --> 12:52.586
- Well, it seems to be
working.

12:52.586 --> 12:54.413
Yeah.

12:54.413 --> 12:59.034
I read that people are
turning on the Vice President.

12:59.034 --> 13:01.551
- My Franklin supporters
are the best.

13:01.551 --> 13:04.413
- You really think they like
you, huh?

13:04.413 --> 13:06.448
I know they do.

13:06.448 --> 13:09.275
- Okay, you keep thinking
that.

13:09.275 --> 13:13.206
They made me President.

13:13.206 --> 13:18.620
- So, what are you going
to do, Mr. President?

13:18.620 --> 13:20.103
About?

13:20.103 --> 13:23.103
Your Vice President.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.172
Better get him in line.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.689
I'm gonna kill him.

13:30.448 --> 13:34.068
Hunter, you--
you can't kill him.

13:34.068 --> 13:38.482
I can and I will.

13:40.448 --> 13:43.586
- And how will you do that,
pray tell?

13:46.517 --> 13:50.344
- He's on a summit trip on
the eighth.

13:50.344 --> 13:52.586
He's gonna have plane issues.

13:54.965 --> 13:57.724
Hunter, you are so dumb.

13:57.724 --> 14:00.379
Why is that dumb?

14:00.379 --> 14:05.724
- If his plane goes down,
you could start World War III.

14:07.586 --> 14:09.482
Accidents happen.

14:09.482 --> 14:13.000
- The country will be
looking to name an enemy,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.896
Congress certainly will.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.793
I'll think of something.

14:17.793 --> 14:22.103
- No Hunter, how about
you don't think of anything

14:22.103 --> 14:25.137
because everything you
think is stupid.

14:25.137 --> 14:28.758
- I just won't use
the side of my brain

14:28.758 --> 14:30.793
that decided to marry you.

14:30.793 --> 14:33.172
Oh yes, yes, yes.

14:33.172 --> 14:37.137
The side that I wish that
bullet had blown off.

14:37.137 --> 14:40.275
Your father missed.

14:40.275 --> 14:42.482
It was a warning, Hunter.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.068
Get over it.

14:44.068 --> 14:46.931
- Yeah, why do you say
that?

14:46.931 --> 14:50.896
- Because you'd surely
be dead.

14:50.896 --> 14:54.344
- Maybe that bullet was
meant for you.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.068
- I'm pretty sure your name
was all over it.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.172
Weren't you leaving?

15:05.172 --> 15:09.413
- No, I need to be here a
little longer.

15:09.413 --> 15:11.896
I need to look a little
haggard.

15:11.896 --> 15:17.034
- Oh darling, you wake up
haggard.

15:17.034 --> 15:18.896
Are you kidding me?

15:18.896 --> 15:21.724
I'm flawless.

15:21.724 --> 15:23.862
It's so hard to make these
press people believe

15:23.862 --> 15:28.103
- I really give a shit.
- You'll think of something.

15:30.206 --> 15:33.793
- Yeah, just like I used to
make you think

15:33.793 --> 15:36.413
I enjoyed sex with you.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.551
That was some good acting.

15:38.551 --> 15:42.275
No, joy I know.

15:42.275 --> 15:46.275
Faking sadness, not so much.

15:46.275 --> 15:50.379
- Look, we both know that
we hate each other,

15:50.379 --> 15:54.172
so can we just not talk?

15:54.172 --> 15:55.793
Fine with me.

16:00.482 --> 16:02.206
Victoria!

16:02.206 --> 16:04.000
What?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.344
I need to check my makeup.

16:06.344 --> 16:09.344
- Can't you see he's in
the bed?

16:09.344 --> 16:13.965
Hunter, he can't feel it.

16:13.965 --> 16:16.517
- Don't you care about him
at all?

16:16.517 --> 16:19.206
No.

16:19.206 --> 16:21.068
Do you?

16:21.068 --> 16:24.172
- Yes.
- Oh, please.

16:24.172 --> 16:29.310
You know, I was never cut
out for this mom shit.

16:29.310 --> 16:34.413
They were good for helping
us look like the perfect family,

16:34.413 --> 16:38.448
but now that Gayle's gone
and this little --

16:38.448 --> 16:41.275
being our saving grace,

16:41.275 --> 16:44.172
I guess I could thank him.

16:44.172 --> 16:47.206
So how about you shut up,
okay?

16:47.206 --> 16:49.724
I'll only be here a little
while longer.

16:59.344 --> 17:04.758
I wonder what's on television
tonight.

17:04.758 --> 17:07.931
I hope he don't give that
dumb bitch the rose.

17:23.241 --> 17:24.965
Richard.

17:24.965 --> 17:26.517
Richard.

17:26.517 --> 17:28.379
Yeah?

17:28.379 --> 17:29.931
Somebody is knocking.

17:36.206 --> 17:38.103
This late?

17:38.103 --> 17:41.413
- Yeah.

17:41.413 --> 17:43.827
Who could it be?

17:43.827 --> 17:45.275
I don't know.

17:49.103 --> 17:50.551
I'm gonna go with you.

17:58.034 --> 17:59.517
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

18:11.862 --> 18:13.172
Who is it?

18:13.172 --> 18:16.206
It's Sam.

18:16.206 --> 18:18.172
Hey.

18:18.172 --> 18:21.862
Sorry to come by so late.

18:21.862 --> 18:23.965
- What's up, Uncle Sam?
- Hey there.

18:23.965 --> 18:25.413
Did I wake all of you up?

18:25.413 --> 18:27.413
- Yeah.
- Is everything okay?

18:27.413 --> 18:32.379
- I'm sorry about that.
Yeah, yeah.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.931
- Y'all go back to bed,
let me talk to him.

18:34.931 --> 18:36.344
Alright, goodnight Sam.

18:36.344 --> 18:38.068
- Goodnight.
- You sure?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.896
What's going on?

18:51.896 --> 18:55.000
Priscilla...

18:55.000 --> 18:56.862
What is it?

18:56.862 --> 19:00.068
She put me out.

19:00.068 --> 19:03.517
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.413
Hell, I'm sorry man.

19:06.413 --> 19:09.827
- Nah.
Can I--

19:09.827 --> 19:13.586
- You can have the couch
or Callie's room.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.344
- No, no, no, I'll take the
couch.

19:15.344 --> 19:16.896
- Okay.
- I have to get to work

19:16.896 --> 19:18.655
in a couple of hours.
I just need--

19:18.655 --> 19:21.344
- Look man, you don't have
to explain. You know that.

19:21.344 --> 19:23.344
Thank you.

19:23.344 --> 19:25.000
Come on.

19:30.965 --> 19:34.931
Thank you.

19:34.931 --> 19:36.827
Have you heard from her?

19:36.827 --> 19:38.172
Who?

19:38.172 --> 19:40.379
- Callie?
- Yeah.

19:40.379 --> 19:43.344
I should be asking you that.

19:43.344 --> 19:45.172
- And I should be asking you
both that.

19:45.172 --> 19:46.862
- Barry, I told you to go to
bed.

19:46.862 --> 19:49.448
- Dad, I can't.
- Look Son, now is not the time.

19:49.448 --> 19:51.344
- Dad, that's my daughter.
When is the time?

19:51.344 --> 19:53.068
- Barry, I'll tell you what I
know.

19:57.275 --> 19:59.137
The FBI has a man on the
inside,

19:59.137 --> 20:01.137
and they have footage of
the kids.

20:01.137 --> 20:02.379
- Okay, so has he seen
Callie?

20:02.379 --> 20:04.000
- They are watching all of
the kids, Barry.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.896
- Alright, great.
So when are they going to

20:05.896 --> 20:09.448
- shut this shit down?
- They are not telling me that.

20:09.448 --> 20:12.482
- Why the hell not?
- Barry, listen.

20:12.482 --> 20:14.344
I know your daughter is in
there, okay.

20:14.344 --> 20:16.482
And I know how important
this is to you, me,

20:16.482 --> 20:18.482
and everybody here.

20:18.482 --> 20:19.931
But you have to understand,
okay,

20:19.931 --> 20:23.172
the FBI is after a big drug
ring.

20:23.172 --> 20:24.482
- So my daughter is
collateral?

20:24.482 --> 20:26.482
- It won't come to that.
- How do you know?

20:26.482 --> 20:28.551
- Barry, I can't tell you how
I know.

20:28.551 --> 20:30.793
- Well, what the hell, Uncle
Sam! What can you tell me?

20:30.793 --> 20:33.275
- Barry, I can't compromise
information, okay.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.827
But just know that your
daughter is safe

20:34.827 --> 20:36.344
even though the conditions
are bad.

20:36.344 --> 20:38.344
- How do you know she's safe?
- Barry.

20:38.344 --> 20:40.517
- No, tell me.
How do you know she's safe?

20:40.517 --> 20:43.275
- Barry, this is not something
you want to hear.

20:43.275 --> 20:44.896
I need to hear this.

20:48.448 --> 20:52.482
Her age...

20:52.482 --> 20:54.896
What about her age?

20:54.896 --> 20:57.896
- She's at an age where
they keep the kids safe.

20:57.896 --> 21:00.862
Barry...

21:00.862 --> 21:04.344
- When do they not keep
them safe?

21:04.344 --> 21:05.965
10.

21:09.896 --> 21:11.413
- What happens at 10
years old?

21:11.413 --> 21:13.517
- She'll be out of there
before she's nine.

21:13.517 --> 21:15.241
- But she's eight now.
- My point.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.827
Barry...

21:21.758 --> 21:23.310
And you're okay with this?

21:23.310 --> 21:25.413
- You've gotta be okay with
this for her survival, Barry.

21:25.413 --> 21:27.413
- You want me to be okay
with a bunch

21:27.413 --> 21:28.827
of crazy mother -- kidnapping
my daughter?!

21:28.827 --> 21:30.448
- Watch your mouth.
- For the sake of some

21:30.448 --> 21:32.172
- investigation?
- You don't have a choice.

21:39.896 --> 21:43.758
- If anything happens to my
daughter,

21:43.758 --> 21:48.551
I will never forgive you,
ever.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.103
I understand.

21:59.103 --> 22:02.344
Jesus.

22:02.344 --> 22:06.344
Look man, get some rest.

22:06.344 --> 22:08.103
We'll talk about this in
the morning.

22:08.103 --> 22:09.275
Okay.

22:18.413 --> 22:21.275
Is everything alright?

22:21.275 --> 22:24.344
No.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.655
What's going on?

22:26.655 --> 22:29.482
Him and Priscilla...

22:29.482 --> 22:32.620
Well, I tried to talk to her.

22:32.620 --> 22:36.655
Yeah, I know.

22:36.655 --> 22:40.206
- It's just gonna take her
some time.

22:40.206 --> 22:44.068
Yeah, maybe that will help.

22:44.068 --> 22:45.689
- You know what?
I think it will help.

22:45.689 --> 22:49.586
- Maybe it will, maybe it
won't.

22:49.586 --> 22:51.310
Well, Richard...

22:51.310 --> 22:53.965
- You have to really love
someone

22:53.965 --> 22:58.103
to get over being cheated
on.

22:58.103 --> 23:01.344
Richard...

23:01.344 --> 23:05.068
No, no I was just saying.

23:07.517 --> 23:11.620
Well, I'm glad you love me.

23:11.620 --> 23:13.172
I do.

23:21.517 --> 23:23.034
You're here late.

23:23.034 --> 23:25.724
- Yeah, Chief of Staff,
you know, he wanted me to

23:25.724 --> 23:27.448
handle a couple of things
tonight.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.068
- Oh, okay.
- Thanks.

23:29.068 --> 23:31.689
- I'm surprised to see you
here.

23:31.689 --> 23:33.551
What do you mean?

23:33.551 --> 23:36.413
- I mean with your girl and
all...

23:36.413 --> 23:39.137
Yeah, um, yeah...

23:39.137 --> 23:40.586
I'm sorry.

24:03.517 --> 24:05.379
- That's strange.
- Yeah.

24:05.379 --> 24:06.827
Let me check it.

24:15.586 --> 24:17.034
- There you go.
- Thanks.

24:17.034 --> 24:18.620
- It looks like you had
a sticker blowing.

24:18.620 --> 24:20.413
Oh, shit.

24:20.413 --> 24:22.206
- Band-Aid or something.
- Yeah.

24:22.206 --> 24:23.413
Thanks.

24:49.724 --> 24:51.827
- Sir.
- Yes.

24:51.827 --> 24:54.551
Well, this was legit.

24:54.551 --> 24:58.241
- The kid?
- Yes sir.

24:58.241 --> 25:02.965
Alright, where is he?

25:02.965 --> 25:06.034
I have him, sir.

25:06.034 --> 25:07.827
Okay.

25:07.827 --> 25:10.034
What should I do with him?

25:10.034 --> 25:11.827
- He's still sticking with
his story?

25:11.827 --> 25:13.620
Yes sir, he is.

25:13.620 --> 25:16.103
- Alright, bring him to me.
- Yes sir.

25:16.103 --> 25:17.862
- Hey, have you,
have you heard anything

25:17.862 --> 25:20.551
- from Kyle?
- No sir.

25:20.551 --> 25:22.034
Are you tracking him?

25:22.034 --> 25:24.103
- He doesn't have anything
to track, sir.

25:24.103 --> 25:27.034
What about his shoes, huh?

25:27.034 --> 25:28.655
No sir.

25:28.655 --> 25:31.482
That son of a bitch.

25:31.482 --> 25:33.000
- Should we be concerned,
sir?

25:33.000 --> 25:34.896
No, no, no, no, no.

25:34.896 --> 25:36.724
- Are you sure, sir?
- No, it's fine!

25:36.724 --> 25:38.482
- It's fine.
- Yes sir.

25:38.482 --> 25:41.724
- Look, you let me know
when you're here, okay?

25:41.724 --> 25:43.275
Yes sir.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.793
Yeah.

25:52.724 --> 25:54.448
Well, I'm going home.

25:54.448 --> 25:56.689
Yes ma'am.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.965
Where are the press?

25:58.965 --> 26:01.724
- They're downstairs, ma'am,
on the first floor.

26:01.724 --> 26:03.793
Good, good.

26:03.793 --> 26:06.793
I want to walk by them to
the motorcade.

26:06.793 --> 26:08.137
Yes ma'am.

26:08.137 --> 26:10.758
- And I'll need someone
holding me up

26:10.758 --> 26:14.413
to make it look like I really
give a shit.

26:14.413 --> 26:17.448
Yes ma'am.

26:17.448 --> 26:18.931
Donald.

26:18.931 --> 26:22.931
- Ma'am?
- What's that look for?

26:22.931 --> 26:26.965
- You're really enjoying this,
aren't you?

26:26.965 --> 26:30.034
- Let me ask you a question.
- Sure.

26:30.034 --> 26:33.103
- Are the press talking about
the Vice President

26:33.103 --> 26:36.379
or are they talking about my
son?

26:36.379 --> 26:39.724
- They're talking about your
son, ma'am.

26:39.724 --> 26:43.068
- So the little bastard did us
a favor,

26:43.068 --> 26:44.896
and I'm going to milk this shit.

26:44.896 --> 26:46.724
I am sure you are.

26:46.724 --> 26:48.896
I will.

26:48.896 --> 26:50.931
- Ma'am, don't you think it
would be best

26:50.931 --> 26:53.862
if you at least stayed the
night with your son?

26:53.862 --> 26:56.827
- I'm not staying
in this shit box.

26:56.827 --> 26:58.655
My bed is much too
comfortable, Donald,

26:58.655 --> 27:01.793
- you know better than that.
- Yes ma'am.

27:01.793 --> 27:04.482
- Okay, well I'll need some
flats.

27:04.482 --> 27:07.896
Red bottoms are a bit too
much, don't you think?

27:07.896 --> 27:09.931
- Yeah, yeah.

27:09.931 --> 27:11.965
Get me some flats.

27:11.965 --> 27:14.448
And, you know what?

27:14.448 --> 27:16.862
Nevermind.

27:16.862 --> 27:19.379
I'll go in these.

27:19.379 --> 27:23.655
It was he who jumped, not
my sense of fashion.

27:23.655 --> 27:25.379
Yes ma'am.

27:28.931 --> 27:31.551
Lord, this woman.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.965
- Sir.
- Hey.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.655
How is he?

27:44.655 --> 27:46.103
The same.

27:49.793 --> 27:53.655
Can I get you anything?

27:53.655 --> 27:55.241
That nurse still around?

27:56.689 --> 27:57.931
Sir...

27:57.931 --> 28:00.827
- The one with the tight ass?
- No.

28:00.827 --> 28:03.000
No sir, she's gone for the
day.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.689
- Well, if you could bring
her that would be great.

28:09.206 --> 28:11.000
- Sir, just because you are
the President

28:11.000 --> 28:12.896
- of the United States--
- What?

28:12.896 --> 28:15.793
- It doesn't mean that you can
have any woman that you want.

28:15.793 --> 28:18.827
- I have no idea what you're
talking about, Donald.

28:18.827 --> 28:23.068
- That girl that you had Kyle
bring to the White House...

28:23.068 --> 28:25.482
- That is one feisty little
hot piece of ass.

28:25.482 --> 28:27.172
- Yeah, well that
feisty hot piece of ass'

28:27.172 --> 28:30.068
boyfriend went to the DC
police.

28:30.068 --> 28:33.482
- What?
- Yeah.

28:33.482 --> 28:34.862
Huh.

28:34.862 --> 28:39.000
- She told him?
- Why wouldn't she, sir?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.827
- I thought I gave her
enough reasons not to.

28:41.827 --> 28:43.758
Well, apparently you didn't.

28:43.758 --> 28:45.206
I see.

28:48.137 --> 28:52.137
- But I handled it.
- What did you do?

28:52.137 --> 28:54.827
- I've got Secret Service
on him right now.

28:54.827 --> 28:58.000
- Good.
I want to meet him.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.862
- No, sir.
- No, no, yeah.

28:59.862 --> 29:02.241
- Bring him here.
- No, sir. That's, no...

29:02.241 --> 29:05.896
- I want to meet the guy
that thinks it's a good idea

29:05.896 --> 29:08.793
to go to the police on the
President.

29:08.793 --> 29:10.103
Well sir, you know...

29:10.103 --> 29:12.034
Takes balls.

29:12.034 --> 29:13.827
I'll give him that.

29:13.827 --> 29:16.724
- Sir, I'm not going to
advise that.

29:16.724 --> 29:19.931
Donald, do you think I care?

29:19.931 --> 29:21.413
I am sure that you don't.

29:24.241 --> 29:26.034
- Let me know when he's
here.

29:29.068 --> 29:33.689
And check on that nurse if
you can.

29:33.689 --> 29:36.275
Yes sir.

29:36.275 --> 29:40.310
Sir, can we talk about your
Vice President now?

29:42.689 --> 29:45.310
- Victoria and I already
talked about it, it's handled.

29:45.310 --> 29:48.793
- What exactly do you
have planned?

29:48.793 --> 29:54.724
Eli, Max, Bobby, the wife,

29:54.724 --> 29:57.206
and the kids...

29:57.206 --> 30:00.068
They're all gonna die.

30:00.068 --> 30:02.344
What?

30:02.344 --> 30:05.172
That summit on the eighth.

30:05.172 --> 30:08.310
I can't make it because of
my son.

30:08.310 --> 30:10.068
They're gonna take
Air Force Two

30:10.068 --> 30:14.172
and there's gonna be a
horrible accident.

30:21.931 --> 30:23.965
Think he can hear us?

30:23.965 --> 30:25.448
- No, look at his brain
activity.

30:25.448 --> 30:29.758
- Okay, well, I don't think
that's a good idea.

30:29.758 --> 30:32.034
- I don't care what you
think.

30:32.034 --> 30:34.896
- It's done.
- Sir, you can't--

30:34.896 --> 30:36.275
You know what?

30:36.275 --> 30:38.172
I'm sick and tired of people
telling me

30:38.172 --> 30:39.931
what I can and can't
do.

30:39.931 --> 30:42.206
He declared war on my
administration.

30:42.206 --> 30:45.862
He tried to ruin me.

30:45.862 --> 30:49.034
I'm just gonna take a page
out of Pablo Escobar's book.

30:51.448 --> 30:55.344
- I'm gonna a fill a plane
full of my enemies.

30:55.344 --> 31:00.965
- Sir,
you are not a drug lord.

31:00.965 --> 31:06.137
Yeah, Donald. I'm worse.

31:06.137 --> 31:09.379
I'm the President of the
United States,

31:09.379 --> 31:12.344
and that's what's happening.

31:12.344 --> 31:13.827
Sir...

31:13.827 --> 31:15.448
- Get the -- out of the room.

31:18.931 --> 31:20.793
- Yes, sir.
- Out!

32:38.448 --> 32:43.034
- You're gonna have to be
more quiet than that, big boy.

32:43.034 --> 32:45.068
Is she asleep?

32:45.068 --> 32:46.655
Yeah.

32:50.896 --> 32:53.379
With all of that noise,
I'm surprised you aren't.

32:53.379 --> 32:55.379
- Well, Bobby don't need no--
- No, no, no, no.

32:55.379 --> 32:59.137
Don't do that third-person
crap.

32:59.137 --> 33:01.103
Look, I gotta do it.

33:01.103 --> 33:02.482
I'm Bobby, baby.

33:02.482 --> 33:05.379
I got to do some of it.

33:05.379 --> 33:07.206
- What is wrong with
you?

33:07.206 --> 33:10.206
- What you working on?
- Checking our clearance.

33:10.206 --> 33:11.758
What?

33:11.758 --> 33:13.931
- Yeah, we're still good in
the White House.

33:13.931 --> 33:15.413
Really?

33:15.413 --> 33:18.931
- Yup.
- Well, it won't be for long.

33:18.931 --> 33:22.206
- I don't know. You know how
sloppy that administration is.

33:22.206 --> 33:24.758
- Yeah, I get that.
- I want to get in there.

33:24.758 --> 33:28.655
Max...

33:28.655 --> 33:30.137
I think they have him here.

33:30.137 --> 33:32.965
- Max, come on with this, man!
- Look!

33:32.965 --> 33:35.448
Sam has him in a bunker,
okay?

33:35.448 --> 33:39.689
He's either in this one or
that one.

33:39.689 --> 33:44.068
- Okay, so how are you
supposed to get in there?

33:44.068 --> 33:46.482
The VP can get me access.

33:46.482 --> 33:50.793
- How? We haven't heard from him
in hours.

33:50.793 --> 33:52.862
So what does that mean?

33:52.862 --> 33:55.068
- I mean, you heard what
they said on the news.

33:55.068 --> 33:56.448
Maybe it's over.

33:56.448 --> 33:58.931
- By blaming everything on
the son?

33:58.931 --> 34:01.275
Yes.

34:01.275 --> 34:03.862
- The mattress top has
the DNA of the President

34:03.862 --> 34:05.379
and Denise on it.

34:05.379 --> 34:07.344
- They can just say the son
was having sex with her

34:07.344 --> 34:09.448
in the President's bedroom.

34:09.448 --> 34:12.448
- They can't prove that.
They can't prove that he was--

34:12.448 --> 34:14.310
- Max, they got us on the
ropes.

34:14.310 --> 34:16.103
- Alright, give up.
- No, no, no, no, no.

34:16.103 --> 34:18.000
We can't just give up that
easy.

34:23.172 --> 34:26.172
- I know what you're thinking.
- You know what I'm thinking?

34:26.172 --> 34:27.689
You know what I'm
thinking?

34:27.689 --> 34:31.827
Kyle murdered Yuma and
countless others.

34:31.827 --> 34:35.310
He waterboarded your
precious Lilly,

34:35.310 --> 34:39.172
and now you just want to
let him go?

34:39.172 --> 34:42.103
- No, I don't wanna let him go.
I know we will get our chance.

34:42.103 --> 34:44.310
I just want to do it the
right way.

34:44.310 --> 34:45.896
Where's Bobby?

34:45.896 --> 34:48.206
Where'd he go?
No, no, no. Is this Lilly?

34:48.206 --> 34:51.206
Get your -- head straight!

34:51.206 --> 34:52.758
Okay.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.586
So how are you supposed
to get in there?

34:54.586 --> 34:57.103
It's virtually impossible.

34:57.103 --> 34:59.862
- You did, didn't you,
Mr. Smooth?

34:59.862 --> 35:01.482
I'm Bobby.

35:01.482 --> 35:03.758
- What does that even mean?!
- Okay, okay, okay.

35:03.758 --> 35:06.344
Why are you keep getting
so worked up about this?

35:06.344 --> 35:09.068
Why don't you just let Sam
do what he does?

35:09.068 --> 35:10.689
Sam?

35:17.103 --> 35:19.344
Hey, what's it gonna take?

35:19.344 --> 35:22.965
For what?

35:22.965 --> 35:25.862
For Sam to give us Kyle.

35:25.862 --> 35:28.655
- Sam's a good guy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:28.655 --> 35:32.206
But what's it gonna take?

35:32.206 --> 35:33.827
I don't know.

35:37.137 --> 35:39.965
Kyle to go after his family?

35:42.827 --> 35:44.482
- Max, look, just let it go,
alright?

35:44.482 --> 35:46.827
He's locked up and there's
nothing he can do.

35:46.827 --> 35:50.758
Yeah, okay.

35:50.758 --> 35:53.862
- Why don't you get some
rest, alright?

35:53.862 --> 35:57.344
Yeah.

35:57.344 --> 35:59.931
We'll get him, alright?

35:59.931 --> 36:01.758
Yeah, I got it!

36:22.724 --> 36:26.172
- Hey, did you hear from
Kareem?

36:26.172 --> 36:29.344
- No.
- No?

36:29.344 --> 36:30.965
We shouldn't have told him.

36:34.655 --> 36:37.379
You think he's okay?

36:37.379 --> 36:40.034
I'm sure he is, yeah.

36:40.034 --> 36:42.517
Damn...

36:42.517 --> 36:45.758
- Where do you think he
went?

36:45.758 --> 36:48.931
- He probably went to the
pharmacy.

36:48.931 --> 36:50.275
Let's hope.

36:50.275 --> 36:52.689
Yeah.

36:52.689 --> 36:55.275
Where do you think he went?

36:55.275 --> 36:59.068
- I hope he didn't go to the
police.

36:59.068 --> 37:01.000
He wouldn't do that.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.103
Are you sure?

37:03.103 --> 37:04.827
Yeah.

37:04.827 --> 37:08.689
- He does love to protect
you.

37:08.689 --> 37:10.827
He wouldn't do that.

37:10.827 --> 37:13.517
I hope he wouldn't do
that.

37:13.517 --> 37:17.103
- Yeah, 'cause you know
they're in on it, right?

37:17.103 --> 37:19.275
What?

37:19.275 --> 37:21.655
- Kyle told me that if anyone
calls about the White House

37:21.655 --> 37:24.931
they know right away.

37:24.931 --> 37:28.241
- No, he's smart.
He wouldn't do that.

37:28.241 --> 37:30.862
I hope he wouldn't.

37:30.862 --> 37:33.034
- I'm just gonna call him
again.

37:42.275 --> 37:43.931
Still no answer?

37:43.931 --> 37:46.103
No.

37:46.103 --> 37:47.517
Okay.

37:50.379 --> 37:52.482
Are you worried?

37:52.482 --> 37:55.172
- No.
- You look worried.

37:55.172 --> 37:57.034
Because you look worried.

37:57.034 --> 37:58.275
Well...

38:02.965 --> 38:05.413
- Can you believe we are in
this situation?

38:05.413 --> 38:07.413
No.

38:07.413 --> 38:10.758
- I mean, he must really like
you.

38:10.758 --> 38:12.793
Okay, look who's talking.

38:17.206 --> 38:19.482
- You ever think how we
even got on their radar

38:19.482 --> 38:21.517
in the first place?

38:21.517 --> 38:23.758
No.

38:23.758 --> 38:27.758
- I mean, you think it was
like a plan?

38:27.758 --> 38:31.310
What are you talking about?

38:31.310 --> 38:36.862
- I mean like somebody's
plan.

38:36.862 --> 38:40.620
- Okay, how much have
you been drinking?

38:40.620 --> 38:42.931
It's probably the pain meds.

38:42.931 --> 38:45.620
- Okay, but I don't wanna
think about that.

38:45.620 --> 38:48.344
- Let's not.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

38:48.344 --> 38:50.724
Mmhmm.

38:50.724 --> 38:53.517
- You know, I think I'm just
gonna go lie down.

38:53.517 --> 38:55.379
Okay.

38:55.379 --> 38:57.724
- Can you let me know if
he calls?

38:57.724 --> 38:59.413
Yeah, I will.

38:59.413 --> 39:00.965
Okay.

39:04.206 --> 39:07.724
He'll call or come back,
don't worry.

39:07.724 --> 39:09.413
I hope so.

39:21.482 --> 39:23.689
I'm here.

39:23.689 --> 39:25.448
- We'll be right
down.

39:25.448 --> 39:26.793
We?

39:26.793 --> 39:28.517
Yes.

39:28.517 --> 39:29.896
Yes sir.

39:40.586 --> 39:43.241
Hey, hey!

39:43.241 --> 39:45.448
What?

39:45.448 --> 39:47.379
- I promise I won't say
anything.

39:47.379 --> 39:49.724
It's too late for that.

39:49.724 --> 39:52.551
- Look, just please let me
go.

39:52.551 --> 39:56.551
No, no that's not happening.

39:56.551 --> 39:58.793
- I'm sorry.
- We've been over this.

40:02.827 --> 40:04.586
- What are you going to do
with me?

40:04.586 --> 40:07.310
That depends.

40:07.310 --> 40:08.689
On what?

40:08.689 --> 40:12.172
- The man.
- Come on, please.

40:12.172 --> 40:16.137
- Your girlfriend likes you?
- She loves me.

40:16.137 --> 40:18.931
- With all of this whining like
a bitch?

40:18.931 --> 40:23.275
- I'm sorry.
- Don't say you're sorry again.

40:23.275 --> 40:25.137
It makes it worse.

40:28.379 --> 40:30.689
- Just please tell me what
you're gonna do to me.

40:30.689 --> 40:32.517
You've had me tied up like
a dog.

40:32.517 --> 40:35.620
Will you shut up?

40:35.620 --> 40:37.724
I have a daughter, man.

40:37.724 --> 40:39.448
- Come on.
- No, listen to me.

40:39.448 --> 40:41.689
- I have a daughter.
- Shut up!

41:16.482 --> 41:18.413
So you wanted to see me?

41:18.413 --> 41:20.413
Who is it?

41:20.413 --> 41:21.896
Who is that?!

41:28.655 --> 41:33.448
- So, you you wanted to
see me?

41:33.448 --> 41:35.620
Hunter Franklin.

41:35.620 --> 41:37.965
- Mr. President, mother --.

41:44.275 --> 41:46.517
- I just hope Kareem is okay.
- I'm sure he is.

41:46.517 --> 41:47.896
Next on The Oval...

41:47.896 --> 41:50.206
- I'm gonna
teach you how powerful I am.

41:50.206 --> 41:52.827
- I'm going to
kill you.

41:52.827 --> 41:55.068
- Damn.
- The more that I get pissed,

41:55.068 --> 41:57.379
the more that you're gonna
have trouble getting me to stop.

41:57.379 --> 41:59.931
- Stop what?
- Tearing your life apart.

41:59.931 --> 42:03.275
Yeah, I'm gonna start
with your wife.

42:03.275 --> 42:05.517
- I can have a conversation
with the press.

42:05.517 --> 42:06.827
Then we're clean.

42:06.827 --> 42:08.379
No one is clean.

42:08.379 --> 42:10.482
Kareem?

42:10.482 --> 42:11.827
Nope.
