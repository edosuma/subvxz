00:03.360 --> 00:05.680
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.560
Fascists. Not the ones in boots
and black shirts.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.080
The ones in tuxedos.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.400
Mr Shelby, Lady Diana Mitford.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.000
Oswald's most recent
and last ever mistress.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.880
Officially he's coming to buy
liquor import licenses.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.760
And unofficially
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

00:20.760 --> 00:23.720
By being among the Fascists,
by being among 'em,

00:23.720 --> 00:25.000
I can undermine them.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.400
Still looking for trouble big enough
to kill you. If you don't want

00:27.400 --> 00:29.760
to help me carry the bucket,
then I wouldn't blame you.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.720
You have to carry this bucket
on your own.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.280
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

00:33.280 --> 00:34.560
You're a brave man.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.440
Every war hero I ever met,

00:37.440 --> 00:40.080
they're just someone who wanted
to get themselves killed.

00:40.080 --> 00:43.000
If anyone is going to kill
Tommy Shelby... It will be you.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.200
The devil will be dead.
The future belongs to us.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.040
You need to see a doctor.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.560
We've got to keep going until
the Boston business is done.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.360
SHE COUGHS
Hello?

00:54.360 --> 00:56.840
Tommy, she has a temperature of 101
and nothing is working.

00:56.840 --> 00:57.920
Just get here now.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.760
This programme contains
strong language from the start.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.800
BREATHING DEEPLY

01:20.120 --> 01:22.400
Out of the way! Out of the way!

01:22.400 --> 01:25.240
No...no. Where's the doctor?
Can you get the doctor?

01:25.240 --> 01:27.120
I need to speak a doctor. Mr Shelby.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.760
Mr Shelby,
your daughter has consumption.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.800
Consumption
is a very infectious disease.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.160
There are procedures
that must be followed.

01:34.160 --> 01:37.080
Please, hand over the child. OK.
Lizzie?

01:37.080 --> 01:38.480
It's going to be all right.

01:38.480 --> 01:41.200
Right, you take her. You be gentle.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.760
Look after her.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.560
That's my daughter, you hear me?

01:45.560 --> 01:47.120
I need to be with her.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.320
I need to be with my daughter!

01:49.320 --> 01:50.560
Tom.

01:50.560 --> 01:54.160
OK. Come on. They are X-raying Ruby,
they have to X-ray us

01:54.160 --> 01:56.720
because we might have it as well.
Fuck us, Lizzie.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.000
Fuck us! Fuck you and me!

01:59.000 --> 02:00.720
Who brought this on?

02:02.920 --> 02:04.880
We brought on this curse.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.880
Stop, Tommy.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.280
Fucking stop!

02:09.680 --> 02:11.280
They wouldn't let me pass.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.600
They wouldn't let me pass.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.600
They did it on purpose,
to punish me.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.960
Tommy, stop it, please.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.920
All right.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.600
HE EXHALES SHARPLY
All right.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.560
My husband is very sorry.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.040
OK.

02:34.040 --> 02:38.840
My husband is very sorry
and he is calm now.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.880
He is recovering from addiction.
Sometimes...

02:47.760 --> 02:49.000
Sometimes...

02:50.120 --> 02:52.720
..he's a horse in a crate,
kicking the crate.

02:54.320 --> 02:55.960
It's just the crate I'm kicking.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.560
I'm sorry.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.080
Lizzie. Yeah?

03:03.080 --> 03:04.760
Tell me what I have to do.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.880
This way, sir. Sorry.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.200
Thank you.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.280
DEVICE WHIRS

03:19.760 --> 03:22.480
Mr Shelby, you will need to
keep still for a moment.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.640
DOOR SHUTS

03:36.920 --> 03:38.720
To see what's inside.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.080
Wait till you see.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.480
God.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.560
God knows what's inside.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.160
God help her.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.600
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

04:29.960 --> 04:32.320
She has a tubercular infection
in her left lung.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.320
They've caught it quite early.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.200
They'll do more tests.

04:40.840 --> 04:44.640
They do this thing,
pulmonary something,

04:44.640 --> 04:47.440
where they collapse the lung,
let it rest.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.120
Sometimes the lung cures itself.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.480
And if that doesn't work,
they use gold.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.600
What?

04:56.600 --> 05:00.040
Gold? Gold salts.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.320
The doctor said he explained
their methods to you

05:02.320 --> 05:05.120
when you cut the ribbon to open
the institution.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.400
I can't remember,
I wasn't listening.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.360
Yeah, well.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.360
Gold salts.

05:11.360 --> 05:14.640
Salt with 37% gold.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.600
They say it helps, but it will
make her more sick at first.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.080
Did they say what...?

05:36.080 --> 05:38.440
Did they say what the chances are?

05:38.440 --> 05:41.920
No. They don't say. Hm.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.200
But she's small.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.840
And with TB that's not good
because the disease is big and fast.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.800
SHE SOBS

05:55.200 --> 05:57.240
SOBBING CONTINUES

06:30.160 --> 06:33.280
I'm so sorry, my darling.

06:36.360 --> 06:37.800
But I will deal with it.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.840
I will make it go away.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.600
I will strike a bargain.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.480
DOOR OPENS

06:55.640 --> 06:57.160
You should be wearing a mask.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.240
I am.

07:21.360 --> 07:25.080
You can try gold,
I will try something else.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.200
DEVICE CLICKS

07:34.200 --> 07:35.760
Mayfair 244.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.320
Ada. Listen to me.

07:39.320 --> 07:42.120
I need you to be me in London.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.880
No, it's important.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.040
I know you want nothing to do
with my business,

07:46.040 --> 07:48.520
but Ruby is very sick.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.360
I need five days of your time.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.200
PHONE CLUNKS AND DINGS

07:57.320 --> 07:59.200
CAR HORN TOOTS

08:05.840 --> 08:07.480
So she dresses well.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.040
Go to the door and take her coat.
Yes, ma'am.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.440
Uh...and make a note of the label.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.960
Of course, ma'am.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.440
SHE EXHALES SOFTLY

08:47.640 --> 08:49.760
Oh, Thomas, where the devil are you?

09:23.760 --> 09:25.960

10:05.280 --> 10:07.000
Mrs Ada Thorne, ma'am.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.520
I thought you were all called
Shelby. Ah, I'm a widow.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.240
My husband didn't have the
good grace to die. He lingers yet.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.400
Your husband is a member of
the Guinness family, I believe.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.640
They do a lot of good work on behalf
of the poor.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.320
The poor who are only poor because

10:22.320 --> 10:25.480
they spent so much of their income
on Guinness. Please.

10:25.480 --> 10:29.320
I think the causes of poverty are
a little more complex than that.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.560
Yes. I believe it is to do
with genetics.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.560
Huh. Beautiful vase.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.480
My grandfather stole it from
a brothel in Cairo.

10:37.480 --> 10:40.560
Egyptian. The 18th Dynasty, I think.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.040
How do you know so much about
Egyptian vases?

10:43.040 --> 10:45.040
I collect antiques. Hm.

10:46.280 --> 10:50.320
A tribe of Gypsies settles on
a clearing in a factory town.

10:50.320 --> 10:53.080
Children, of course,
ensue in their hundreds,

10:53.080 --> 10:56.160
but one of them becomes
a gangster and a politician,

10:56.160 --> 10:57.880
the other a collector of antiques.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.600
It is quite extraordinary.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.200
A result of genetics, I think.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.000
My dear, you researched me
and I researched you.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.760
If this was 1919, you would have
come through my front door carrying

11:08.760 --> 11:10.440
a revolver and a Molotov cocktail

11:10.440 --> 11:12.440
and would happily have blown off
my head.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.280
Hm, isn't it wonderful how time
changes everything?

11:15.280 --> 11:17.160
Where is the American?
He'll be here later.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.000
Where is Mosley? He heard Thomas
wasn't coming so he decided to sulk.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.160
You know how men are.
Where is Thomas?

11:23.200 --> 11:25.080
His daughter is sick.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.360
Does he not employ a Governess?

11:27.360 --> 11:30.480
It's a class thing, a genetic thing.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.000
He puts his daughter's welfare
before business.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.080
Even the business of changing
the world.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.080
I thought today was purely social.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.240
Now that it's just you,
I suppose it will be.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.920
SHE CHUCKLES SOFTLY

11:44.680 --> 11:46.960
You should know your brother
has altered my life.

11:48.360 --> 11:52.720
The men here just bounce up and down
in their saddles in a rising trot,

11:52.720 --> 11:54.440
never even galloping.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.520
Thomas is the man on the horse
on the vase.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.520
That's why I put it out for you
to look at.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.480
According to recent interpretations,

12:03.480 --> 12:07.760
the black rider on 18th Dynasty
vases is meant to signify

12:07.760 --> 12:09.360
approaching death.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.640
So, yes, I suppose it resembles
Thomas.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.760
Tell me, why is he so emotionally
mutilated?

12:16.760 --> 12:20.240
Oh. Because he is a character in
a novel, of course.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.320
One of those novels ladies like you
like to read. All about wild men.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.840
Oh, I don't read novels,

12:26.840 --> 12:29.080
I read only pornography
and politics.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.400
In the absence of the men, shouldn't
we ladies be engaging in small talk?

12:35.600 --> 12:38.120
Very well. Small talk.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.480
You know I like to fuck women
as well as men.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.480
SHE CHUCKLES SOFTLY

12:55.480 --> 12:58.000
Mm, Tommy was right.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.560
He says that everything is a circle.

13:00.560 --> 13:05.120
A lady in Eaton Square, as coarse
and honest as an Aston whore.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.080
I just realised I haven't even
offered you a drink.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.360
BOTTLE CLINKS

13:14.960 --> 13:19.400
Ada. Before the dreary business
of changing the world begins,

13:19.400 --> 13:20.880
I want you to know something.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.480
When the time comes for
the great cleansing,

13:25.480 --> 13:27.800
I myself will personally argue
the case that

13:27.800 --> 13:31.480
the Jews must be dealt with, but
that the Gypsies should be spared.

13:31.480 --> 13:32.880
Huh.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.560
Let's drink whisky
and wait for the American.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.600
Huh.

DISTANT DOGS BARK

14:26.600 --> 14:28.160

14:33.200 --> 14:37.880
I am the owner of this Colt pistol
and the bullets within it.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.360
And I am in a hurry.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.000
I followed the patrin signs
for the Lee family.

14:44.040 --> 14:47.040
I'm looking for Esme Shelby-Lee.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.480
Never heard of her.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.760
TRANSLATION:

14:57.520 --> 15:00.920
Esme's husband
was a fucking dirty Didicoi.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.960
He was a Peaky Blinder. Yeah?

15:03.960 --> 15:06.440
Well, I'm the elder and more
terrible.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.120
And as I said, I'm in a hurry.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.440
Where is she?

15:31.160 --> 15:34.160
Put your gun away, Thomas,
there's children around.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.040
You only found me
cos I let you find me.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.240
I heard you were looking,
and I'm curious.

15:49.360 --> 15:54.960
If any of these men is your man,
please tell him I want no trouble.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.160
I don't have a man.

15:57.680 --> 15:58.960
What use is a man?

16:00.360 --> 16:03.480
A horse pulls the wagon.
A dog keeps me safe.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.080
A cat keeps me warm at night.

16:07.520 --> 16:12.600
And if anybody's going to give you
trouble, Tommy Shelby. It'll be me.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.000
What do you want?

16:16.080 --> 16:17.520
Tell them to leave.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.960
What, you think I'm in charge here?

16:20.960 --> 16:22.360
Oh, I'm sure of it, Esme.

16:24.120 --> 16:28.280
TRANSLATION:

16:51.000 --> 16:53.880
Didicoi's too grand to put his arse
on the grass these days?

17:00.080 --> 17:02.880
I have a daughter, Esme.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.760
Her name is Ruby.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.720
She's fallen ill suddenly.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.280
She's very sick.

17:10.800 --> 17:15.760
And I can tell by saying her name
and looking in your eyes

17:15.760 --> 17:18.040
that I have wasted petrol,
time and hope.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.760
Wasted petrol on what?

17:23.280 --> 17:24.400
Ah...

17:25.680 --> 17:28.880
Tommy Shelby, OBE MP.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.600
Running round the mountains in

17:30.600 --> 17:32.640
pursuit of a Gypsy curse,
is that it?

17:34.160 --> 17:37.800
I thought you had Polly deal with
the spirits. Polly is dead.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.600
Bullet or a blade?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.480
Still speaks to me in my dreams.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.640
It was her who told me
to come find you.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.960
Polly.

17:56.560 --> 17:59.080
That name like the ringing of
the school bell.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.480
Come and do as you're told.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.240
Oh, fuck!

18:04.200 --> 18:06.440
I am so glad I'm not in your camp
any more.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.320
Made of bricks and bars.

18:10.600 --> 18:13.160
My daughter is dying, Esme.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.480
Some people go to France.
To Lourdes.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.200
I hear they sell trinkets.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.720
I need more than fucking trinkets.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.080
I can tell from your reaction
this is not your doing.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.680
I'm sorry for troubling you.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.440
CLOCK TICKS

18:40.880 --> 18:42.640
DOOR OPENS

18:45.760 --> 18:49.520
The butler says our American friend
is parking the car.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.360
He also says, in answer to
your inquiry, Diana,

18:52.360 --> 18:55.560
that the coat our exotic friend
is wearing is made by Chanel.

18:57.920 --> 19:01.160
That's a very expensive label.
Yes, it is.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.400
But the perfume
I can smell on you is very cheap.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.960
HE CLEARS THROAT

19:10.760 --> 19:14.040
I am deeply, deeply annoyed
that Thomas isn't here.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.760
It is a family emergency,
apparently.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.920
We only have Ada. The sister.

19:20.760 --> 19:24.080
Well, would the sister like
some more Champagne?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.000
Oh, the sister is allowed to speak?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.040
She thinks this lunch is
purely social.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.440
SHE CHUCKLES

19:29.440 --> 19:32.520
The sister is here because there's
sickness in the family.

19:32.520 --> 19:35.120
Thomas wanted someone from
the Shelby organisation

19:35.120 --> 19:36.600
to introduce Mr Nelson to you

19:36.600 --> 19:39.320
and to offer all three of you
an invitation.

19:39.320 --> 19:43.000
Ooh. What invitation?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.760
The invitation can wait.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.840
And please remember, in this moment,
in this room,

19:47.840 --> 19:50.240
it is the Shelby family
that holds the power,

19:50.240 --> 19:53.240
because we have the information
and the incentives

19:53.240 --> 19:56.640
that will make Mr Nelson do
what you require him to do.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.320
So when I speak, please keep
your fucking mouths closed,

19:59.320 --> 20:02.760
because, although I'm reluctant,
I am actually quite good at this.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.800
And yes, I will have Champagne.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.240
DISTANT GIGGLING

20:10.360 --> 20:12.960
Ah. Take care of this.

20:12.960 --> 20:16.680
OK, so before these dull
introductions begin,

20:16.680 --> 20:19.760
I just have to tell you something
that my niece Gina just told me.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.720
Oh, Jack. She said the Shelby family
are all witches

20:22.720 --> 20:24.880
and sorcerers who speak freely
with the dead.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.400
So who here's a Shelby?

20:30.440 --> 20:31.720
SHE CLEARS THROAT

20:31.720 --> 20:33.400
Is it true?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.760
Gina. Hello, Ada.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.760
Michael sends his regards.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.520
You're the sister.

20:41.520 --> 20:44.480
Yes, it seems I am indeed
the sister.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.760
I did some research.

20:45.760 --> 20:49.240
You were a Communist once,
but diamonds and lipstick now.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.760
Actually, I'm a Socialist.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.600
She is Mr Shelby's
political adviser.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.680
And you, you're the future
Prime Minister of Great Britain

20:57.680 --> 20:59.720
and its dominions. Indeed I am.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.320
And you, Lady Diana Mitford,

21:02.320 --> 21:05.360
the talk of London with
her amphetamines and emeralds.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.840
SHE CHUCKLES

21:06.840 --> 21:09.400
It is her sharp mind that
I am in love with.

21:09.400 --> 21:13.280
Men bore me.
Ada, do you have a man?

21:13.280 --> 21:16.400
My husband died,
but of course we speak often.

21:18.200 --> 21:23.840
Between this sparkling conversation,
could I get a drink of some kind?

21:23.840 --> 21:26.680
So this little kid Gina,
she runs out,

21:26.680 --> 21:28.560
she marries a gangster,

21:28.560 --> 21:30.400
and now here we all are.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.640
Oh, Jack, please, you are so blunt.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.400
Yes, it's wonderful.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.880
A man who is not careful
with his words.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.440
I'm not careful.

21:38.440 --> 21:42.200
Just say it first then clear up
the broken glass with my bare hands.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.040
There you are.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.000
I don't seem to have
a drink either.

21:47.160 --> 21:50.480
Well, I have Scotch or Irish.

21:50.480 --> 21:51.920
Thomas drinks Irish.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.240
Where the hell is he? Irish.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.280
He's been unavoidably detained.

21:56.280 --> 21:59.160
Nothing is unavoidable.
His daughter is unwell.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.760
He doesn't have a wife?

22:05.240 --> 22:08.480
You know, I did some research
on you too, Mr Nelson.

22:08.480 --> 22:11.200
Ada here is the smart one
of the family.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.520
I learnt that when you were young
you lost a brother

22:13.520 --> 22:15.240
and a sister to consumption?

22:22.880 --> 22:24.440
No ice?

22:24.440 --> 22:28.480
Well, that same awful illness
has entered our family.

22:28.480 --> 22:32.320
And, you see, Thomas has very little
faith in current medical practice

22:32.320 --> 22:35.280
regarding tuberculosis.
Man, he has that right.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.480
He's gone off in search
of alternative approaches

22:37.480 --> 22:38.920
to curing the disease.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.880
Experimental work that he hopes
will save the life of his daughter.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.840
In his shoes I would do
the same thing.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.840
Your brother intrigues me.

22:46.840 --> 22:49.640
Yes, he often has that effect
on people.

22:51.560 --> 22:56.120
Yes, and my future husband has that
effect on 20 million people in this

22:56.120 --> 22:58.560
country who attend his rallies
and listen to his broadcasts.

22:59.640 --> 23:04.600
It's amazing what English
upper class women can do

23:04.600 --> 23:07.680
with just skin, bone and arrogance.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.840
My brother sends his apologies
for not being here

23:11.840 --> 23:15.520
and would like to invite all of you
to his home for a meeting.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.400
A meeting where the real business
will be done.

23:18.400 --> 23:22.080
And where you can meet like minds
from Ireland who would also like

23:22.080 --> 23:24.000
to discuss the future of Europe.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.640
But as you say, this lunch is
purely social.

23:27.640 --> 23:31.920
And looking at my glass, I see
I still don't have Champagne.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.440
Michael told me the sister
had gone straight.

23:34.440 --> 23:38.920
Yes, but her brother is the sun,
and the rest just orbit around him.

23:41.080 --> 23:45.040
Gina tells me lots of things,
but I want to hear it from you, Ada.

23:47.480 --> 23:51.800
What exactly does
the Shelby Company Limited do?

24:06.320 --> 24:08.440
ENGINE SPUTTERS

24:10.880 --> 24:12.560
Fuck!

24:21.240 --> 24:23.160
TAPPING ON WINDOW

24:32.600 --> 24:34.800
You used to have eyes in
the back of your head.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.960
How can you change so much
and not change at all?

24:39.960 --> 24:43.320
I have other lines of inquiry,
give me the spark plug. Gimme the...

24:43.320 --> 24:45.280
Gimme the fucking spark plug.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.520
Give you the spark, give you hope?
Is that what you want?

24:52.240 --> 24:54.400
TRANSLATION:

24:56.080 --> 24:57.960
Something you should see.

24:57.960 --> 25:01.360
Someone dead,
someone grieving.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.480
A lot of hate against you.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.600
You were wise to come to me, Thomas.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.800
Open up the bonnet, would you?

25:16.160 --> 25:18.000
What hate?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.120
What hate, what grieving?

25:44.280 --> 25:46.680
I can't explain where it is
you have to go.

25:46.680 --> 25:47.920
So I'll take you there.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.600
I hope the suspension is good.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.000
We're going to a wild old place.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.040
ENGINE STARTS

26:08.520 --> 26:11.520
Mrs Thorne, Mr Shelby isn't here.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.560
I know. I am.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.480
Do you know where he's gone?

26:15.480 --> 26:18.760
He's gone up a mountain
looking for a miracle.

26:18.760 --> 26:21.960
No-one is allowed to go in
if he's not here.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.520
Just bring me the keys.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.080
All of the keys.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.720
Do you want tea, Mrs Thorne?

26:49.720 --> 26:51.200
Whisky.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.960
Mr Shelby doesn't allow whisky
in the building any more.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.760
Then have someone
go and fetch some.

26:58.560 --> 27:02.400
Until Mr Shelby comes down off
his mountain, I'm in charge.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.960
Yes, Mrs Thorne.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.680
Fuck.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.520
Mickey, I've got to go.
The boss's sister is here.

28:06.520 --> 28:10.440
For the next five days, I'm not
the boss's sister, I'm the boss.

28:10.440 --> 28:14.440
Where is Arthur?
We locked him in the cash safe.

28:14.440 --> 28:18.160
When he gets the yamps really bad
he tells us to lock him in the safe,

28:18.160 --> 28:20.800
to stop him from slipping down
to China Town.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.080
What are the yamps?

28:23.080 --> 28:27.360
When you lose your head.
When you can't control yourself.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.000
Young people say it.

28:31.520 --> 28:34.040
And Arthur gets the yamps a lot?

28:34.040 --> 28:37.720
A lot is twice a day.
Arthur gets them three times a day.

28:38.840 --> 28:41.080
It smells in here.

28:41.080 --> 28:44.760
Arthur sleeps on the floor.
We lock him in at night.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.320
On your feet.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.520
Sit down.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.000
Nice perfume.

29:02.280 --> 29:04.440
Tommy likes you, Isiah.

29:04.440 --> 29:07.760
I believe I'm suited to this life.

29:07.760 --> 29:09.720
I'm not so sure about you.

29:12.320 --> 29:16.240
I was given to understand that you
are no longer part of the company.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.240
Hm.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.320
You speak well.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.760
I was going to be an accountant

29:22.760 --> 29:25.680
but everybody said I would be wasted
counting money,

29:25.680 --> 29:27.320
instead of stealing it.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.960
What's the name of that perfume?

29:31.960 --> 29:34.720
I've got a girlfriend
with a birthday.

29:34.720 --> 29:37.960
I want you to go to Liverpool.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.360
Then I will go to Liverpool.

29:40.360 --> 29:43.720
We have opium in storage at
the Salthouse docks.

29:43.720 --> 29:45.720
Word got out among the dock workers.

29:45.720 --> 29:48.960
They started stealing cupfuls,
now it's by the bucket.

29:48.960 --> 29:52.720
By the bucket? The audacity of it.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.760
The sale of the stolen opium
is being organised

29:57.760 --> 30:01.520
by a union convenor
called Haydn Stagg.

30:01.520 --> 30:04.200
In the envelope you'll find details
of where to find him

30:04.200 --> 30:06.080
and what to do to him when you do.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.440
Is there a black star in
the envelope?

30:12.440 --> 30:14.000
I decided not.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.040
You decided?

30:18.280 --> 30:21.560
The name of the perfume is
know your fucking place, soldier.

30:23.680 --> 30:24.840
PHONE RINGS

30:24.840 --> 30:26.480
I decided he'll just take a beating.

30:26.480 --> 30:30.720
And also, that you're
going to take Arthur with you.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.200
Arthur, ten days clean,

30:33.200 --> 30:35.960
and we're going to take him into
a warehouse full of fucking opium?

30:35.960 --> 30:38.120
It can be your job
to look after him.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.840
Why take him at all?

30:39.840 --> 30:42.400
It's his reputation you're taking.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.800
The beating can be conducted
in a civilised way.

30:45.800 --> 30:49.160
No-one would dare fuck with
Arthur Shelby.

30:49.160 --> 30:51.280
But they would fuck with me?

30:51.280 --> 30:53.920
Yes. He is Arthur Shelby.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.680
You're Isiah...who?

30:59.960 --> 31:05.160
I'm just Isiah,
who is keen to learn, Ada.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.880
Keep him clean.

31:09.160 --> 31:12.480
Deal with Haydn Stagg,
bring Arthur back in one piece.

31:12.480 --> 31:16.360
And in return, I won't tell Tommy
that you're laying private bets

31:16.360 --> 31:18.640
on races that we've fixed.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.960
Just trying to make
a few extra pennies,

31:22.960 --> 31:25.880
buy that birthday present
for my girlfriend.

31:25.880 --> 31:29.280
Mm, lucky girl.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.280
DOOR CLOSES

31:37.400 --> 31:39.920
TRAIN RUMBLES

31:47.240 --> 31:49.080
DOOR OPENS

32:06.960 --> 32:09.880
TRAIN RUMBLES, BOTTLES CLINK

32:15.560 --> 32:18.200
Lock the door, Lizzie.
There are people around here

32:18.200 --> 32:20.880
who start drinking
this early in the morning.

32:26.800 --> 32:28.160
No.

32:29.840 --> 32:33.320
I need to stay myself
and be strong.

32:33.320 --> 32:36.560
Now, come on, not with me.
You can let it go with me.

32:36.560 --> 32:40.960
I can't cry, Ada.
If I start, I'll fall apart.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.800
I need to stay strong for Ruby.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.680
Tommy says it's just in one lung.

32:48.680 --> 32:51.480
No. They now think it's in both.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.840
It's moving quickly.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.520
They collapsed the left lung
but it made no difference.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.840
They're starting her
on the gold salts tomorrow.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.680
You know somebody who died
on the gold treatment, yes?

33:08.680 --> 33:10.960
Half the people I tell
look like you just did

33:10.960 --> 33:13.440
because they know someome
who died on the gold treatment.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.400
The person I knew was old.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.320
Old and young, the same.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.160
Have you given up, Lizzie?

33:29.600 --> 33:31.560
No.

33:31.560 --> 33:35.160
I'm being strong.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.400
At her bedside, on my own.

33:39.080 --> 33:41.800
While Tommy is up in the mountains
to be among the gypsies.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.800
In truth it's a blessing
he's not around at the hospital,

33:47.800 --> 33:50.280
because all he wants to do
is fight people

33:50.280 --> 33:52.160
and blame himself,

33:52.160 --> 33:54.000
and I've never felt
so ashamed of him,

33:54.000 --> 33:57.360
Christ, because right now
I need a normal man.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.920
And it's me sitting there,
taking away the bloody rags

34:02.920 --> 34:04.640
and watching her disappear.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.920
BOTTLES RATTLE AND CLINK

34:26.800 --> 34:30.200
Do you know when he's back, Ada?

34:30.200 --> 34:32.400
He gave me instructions,
not information.

34:37.240 --> 34:39.760
Can you get a message to him?

34:39.760 --> 34:41.160
He'll be out of reach.

34:42.840 --> 34:46.280
Ada, I thought you might
know things.

34:46.280 --> 34:48.360
I've been away from all this.

34:49.640 --> 34:51.320
You're still Gypsy.

34:51.320 --> 34:54.240
Yeah, well. The mystery leaves you.

34:56.200 --> 34:59.800
What mystery? Lizzie, is there
anything practical that I can do?

35:04.080 --> 35:06.760
Before he left, he was looking
for a number for Esme.

35:08.360 --> 35:11.240
What's Esme got to do with this?

35:11.240 --> 35:12.640
I thought you might know.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.840
Esme's a Lee.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.560
What does that mean?

35:18.560 --> 35:21.640
The Lees and the Barwells,
they're wild tribes.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.160
Where do they live?

35:25.160 --> 35:27.760
They're gypsies,
they live where they like.

35:27.760 --> 35:30.240
Fuck. Fuck, Ada.

35:34.320 --> 35:36.640
Tribes in the mountains.

35:38.840 --> 35:41.680
It's 1934, and the doctors
know what it is,

35:41.680 --> 35:43.400
they know what causes it,

35:43.400 --> 35:45.880
but oh, no, my husband,
he knows better.

35:45.880 --> 35:48.840
Not a normal man, your brother.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.560
He's up in the mountains
with fucking horse thieves

35:51.560 --> 35:53.640
and sorcerers while I'm here
on my own.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.960
Not a normal man.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.360
DOOR CLOSES

36:15.720 --> 36:17.720
PHONE RINGS

36:47.000 --> 36:50.720
It's OK, Arthur.
I'll look after you.

36:50.720 --> 36:53.000
Yeah.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.480
And Ada said it would be OK
if I recruited my cousins.

36:56.480 --> 37:00.000
Off the streets of Alum Rock,
and looking for the big time.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.560
What do you say, Arthur?

37:19.840 --> 37:22.720
I say big-time boys
don't ask for permission.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.880
I think he means you're in.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.360
Let's go.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.360
Can you still ride bareback?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.800
ENGINE STOPS

38:18.280 --> 38:22.000
WIND WHISTLES

38:22.000 --> 38:23.640
ROPE SLICES

38:43.520 --> 38:45.160
HORSE WHINNIES

38:56.040 --> 38:58.080
We're a long way from anywhere,
Esme.

38:58.080 --> 39:01.080
If I find out
you've been wasting my time,

39:01.080 --> 39:03.640
I'll use that rope
to fucking hang you.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.880
Right, hold up,
Hold on, hold on.

39:23.880 --> 39:26.760
Listen, you know what
you've got to do, right?

39:26.760 --> 39:29.680
You've got your orders,
I'm depending on you.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.240
Do you hear me?

39:31.240 --> 39:33.000
Let me tell you something.

39:33.000 --> 39:38.360
Any man, any fucking man
who looked like this before...

39:40.600 --> 39:42.320
..they're Peaky Blinder.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.920
Peaky Blinder
still looks like this.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.680
After.

39:58.680 --> 40:01.840
of a smile

40:16.640 --> 40:19.480
We are here to meet
a gentleman called Haydn Stagg.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.560
A gentleman?

40:24.400 --> 40:25.840
Mr Stagg?

40:28.920 --> 40:30.360
That scoundrel.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.600
Never there when you need him.

40:37.320 --> 40:38.800
Who needs him?

40:38.800 --> 40:40.160
We do.

40:41.560 --> 40:42.960
Where is he?

40:44.960 --> 40:49.960
Last I saw he was up to his balls
in a lady called Maria.

40:49.960 --> 40:52.040
THEY LAUGH

40:54.120 --> 40:55.760
We have no time for tradition

40:55.760 --> 40:57.560
or the rules of the sporting life.

40:57.560 --> 41:00.440
Because, among the Peaky Blinders,

41:00.440 --> 41:05.040
any man who comes home from
a mission with all his bullets,

41:05.040 --> 41:06.760
he pays a fine.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.560
My name's Haydn Stagg.

41:10.560 --> 41:13.520
I hear there's some men here
from Birmingham looking for me.

41:14.560 --> 41:17.680
I was in the banana warehouse
playing football with the boys.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.920
GUNSHOT

41:26.360 --> 41:29.400
But I'm guessing you gentlemen
aren't here to kick footballs.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.600
No.

41:32.600 --> 41:35.480
We're here about
other business.

41:36.480 --> 41:39.000
We like to call it
Black Star business.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.480
The Black Star a pub, is it?

41:43.560 --> 41:45.680
Yeah. The Black Star's a pub.

41:47.040 --> 41:49.960
The last pub
you ever fucking drink in.

41:49.960 --> 41:52.600
The Peaky Blinders
take you to the Black Star

41:52.600 --> 41:54.440
and all your troubles are done.

41:56.920 --> 42:00.160
But the pub you drink in,
Mr Stagg,

42:00.160 --> 42:03.240
is called The Dolphin, right?

42:03.240 --> 42:06.200
Every night you're in there.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.240
Not to drink -

42:10.240 --> 42:13.480
you're there divvying up
the days takings, in't ya?

42:16.320 --> 42:17.960
And there's a woman there.

42:19.960 --> 42:24.000
She sings out, "Opium for sale!"

42:26.960 --> 42:28.280
Sit down, boys.

42:33.200 --> 42:36.520
The rules say the King puts his head
on the block and the game is up.

42:38.840 --> 42:41.520
You're stealing from
the Shelby Company Limited.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.280
You're stealing from
the Peaky Blinders, man.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.800
Therefore...

42:53.360 --> 42:54.840
..punishment...

42:55.840 --> 42:59.040
..is a visit
to the Black Star pub.

43:04.880 --> 43:11.520
But, out of kindness of my heart,

43:11.520 --> 43:15.280
your sentence has been commuted.

43:15.280 --> 43:18.880
Praise the fucking Lord!

43:18.880 --> 43:20.880
And our lovely Ada, eh?

43:24.920 --> 43:26.440
Instead...

43:28.160 --> 43:31.440
..instead, Mr Haydn Stagg,
it's just a beating for you.

43:34.280 --> 43:35.840
Well, before I take this beating...

43:38.040 --> 43:40.000
Arthur Shelby, is it, yeah?

43:41.640 --> 43:46.560
Well, comrade, beneath your sleeves
lies the truth.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.920
The marks on your arm.

43:48.920 --> 43:50.240
Yeah.

43:50.240 --> 43:53.280
Stories about you
come up the canal.

43:53.280 --> 43:57.880
Where once you walked fine alone,
now you need a stick.

43:57.880 --> 43:59.840
Let's just fucking do it, Arthur.

44:01.800 --> 44:05.000
For me it was the morphine
they gave us in France.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.080
I got a taste for it, Arthur.

44:08.080 --> 44:12.400
It was 1924 before I realised
the fucking war was over.

44:13.800 --> 44:17.760
There's a warehouse full of it is
just across the yard, there,

44:17.760 --> 44:20.160
where the boys play football.

44:20.160 --> 44:22.920
And they steal it
and roll around laughing,

44:22.920 --> 44:24.760
and it floats in the air.

44:27.680 --> 44:29.560
But I'm strong, comrade.

44:29.560 --> 44:32.600
Arthur. Let's just fucking do it.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.640
Liar. It's me that's due a beating.

44:37.640 --> 44:41.160
But it's me who feels sorry
for you, Mr Shelby.

44:41.160 --> 44:45.760
Because you take your beating
every hour of every day.

44:45.760 --> 44:49.680
Your own blood betrays you,
because it demands dilution.

44:51.160 --> 44:54.120
And sometimes you want to cut
a doorway in your arm

44:54.120 --> 44:57.320
so your blood can escape
and leave you in blessed peace.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.400
Yeah.

44:59.400 --> 45:00.920
Fuck you, man.

45:02.240 --> 45:04.800
I was once where you are now,
Arthur.

45:08.600 --> 45:10.760
If you're going to do it, do it.

45:10.760 --> 45:13.200
But look at me
as the man you can be.

45:16.560 --> 45:19.000
You've tried Jesus, yeah?

45:19.000 --> 45:21.920
Yeah, he looked you up and down
and he shook his head.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.280
Your loved ones...

45:25.080 --> 45:27.000
..your wife, your kids.

45:32.440 --> 45:35.960
Jesus and your wife
and your kids can't help you.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.080
Only you, Arthur Shelby.

45:42.440 --> 45:43.520
Only you.

45:44.560 --> 45:46.560
Don't count the days.

45:46.560 --> 45:48.360
Futile.

45:48.360 --> 45:51.040
You get to 100, then you wake up
and it's fucking one again.

45:55.080 --> 45:56.720
Don't build mountains.

45:58.440 --> 46:00.120
Walk like it's a flat plain.

46:01.320 --> 46:05.320
Easy step by easy step.

46:07.160 --> 46:10.280
Arthur, just give me the fucking
word and I'll fucking do it.

46:14.360 --> 46:17.080
Use your stick, Arthur.
Give him the order.

46:22.920 --> 46:25.960
Arthur, I'm not going to ask you
fucking twice.

46:25.960 --> 46:27.880
Isiah, leave him alone.

46:27.880 --> 46:29.360
No...No fucking way.

46:30.520 --> 46:32.120
I said you can stand down.

46:49.120 --> 46:50.960
Let's go, come on.

46:52.360 --> 46:54.240
Come on, all of ya. Go on. Go on.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.320
Gypsy graveyard?

47:33.320 --> 47:34.640
You can still read the signs.

47:36.440 --> 47:38.800
No horse will go beyond here.
We'll have to walk.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.040
Just tell me whose grave it is.

47:49.040 --> 47:50.880
You'll see.

47:50.880 --> 47:53.000
Who knows what you'll see?

47:55.320 --> 47:57.280
Do you ever go to John's grave?

47:57.280 --> 47:59.000
Things are really bad.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.120
When what's really bad?

48:01.120 --> 48:02.960
I've done bad things, Esme.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.880
And you think now you're being
punished for them?

48:06.880 --> 48:08.720
I would like to make amends.

48:08.720 --> 48:11.600
You want to lift every curse
anyone has ever put on you?

48:11.600 --> 48:13.480
That's a lot of lifting.

48:13.480 --> 48:15.240
My own curse is in there somewhere.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.880
I should have done more
to protect John.

48:16.880 --> 48:18.080
You think in this holy place

48:18.080 --> 48:20.040
the spirits are listening to you
being kind?

48:20.040 --> 48:23.640
Believe it or not, Esme,
I am discovering kindness.

48:23.640 --> 48:25.440
I'm learning it from my children.

48:26.920 --> 48:29.080
Do you ever think
you've lost your mind, Thomas?

48:29.080 --> 48:30.480
Lost it long ago.

48:30.480 --> 48:32.920
I only use the crate it came in.

48:32.920 --> 48:34.920
I know why you're here.

48:34.920 --> 48:36.400
I'm in a hurry, Esme.

48:36.400 --> 48:38.880
You think you can make a deal
even with death?

48:38.880 --> 48:41.320
Well, soon you'll be in
the right place to do it.

48:41.320 --> 48:44.200
The village disappeared.
The church fell down.

48:44.200 --> 48:45.880
Only us still use the graveyard.

48:47.960 --> 48:49.120
Do you recall a sapphire?

48:51.480 --> 48:54.280
You gave a sapphire to
a woman called Bethany Barwell.

48:54.280 --> 48:55.800
Ten years ago.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.920
She took the stone back
to her camp.

48:57.920 --> 49:00.840
I warned her about it,
but she took it anyway.

49:00.840 --> 49:03.280
She gave the sapphire to her sister.

49:03.280 --> 49:05.080
Evadne Barwell.

49:05.080 --> 49:07.920
Evadne put the stone around
the neck of her daughter.

49:07.920 --> 49:08.960
A little girl.

49:11.240 --> 49:13.520
Straight away, the little girl
began to cough.

49:15.680 --> 49:17.680
She died that night.

49:17.680 --> 49:19.000
Seven years old.

49:26.480 --> 49:28.440
I heard they threw the sapphire
in the river.

49:29.680 --> 49:31.400
No-one's ever gone to look
for it.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.440
I'm guessing it'll be the girl's
mother who laid the curse.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.280
Only women can lay curses.

49:41.320 --> 49:44.320
Perhaps she waited until
your little girl was seven,

49:44.320 --> 49:46.120
so you'd know how it feels.

49:57.280 --> 49:59.040
Do you have whisky? No.

50:15.720 --> 50:17.680
Tommy.

50:17.680 --> 50:20.680
Perhaps the treatment will work
and your daughter will live.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.200
It's science.

50:25.200 --> 50:28.120
Science is winning everything
these days.

50:28.120 --> 50:30.040
Even against the angels.

50:34.840 --> 50:37.640
I can leave you, if you want.

50:37.640 --> 50:40.440
Your horse will know his way back.

50:40.440 --> 50:43.640
But I think there should be some
reward for what I have shown you.

50:43.640 --> 50:47.360
Some consideration.
You can afford it, Mr Shelby OBE.

50:49.160 --> 50:50.880
I will find her.

50:50.880 --> 50:53.200
I will find this fucking
Evadne Barwell,

50:53.200 --> 50:54.560
I will fucking find her,

50:54.560 --> 50:56.720
and I will give her money
to take back this curse.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.960
You only found me
because I wanted to be found.

50:58.960 --> 51:01.080
And the Barwells roam from
the border to the sea.

51:01.080 --> 51:03.200
I will give her £10,000.
More. Anything.

51:03.200 --> 51:04.600
You will put out word, Esme.

51:04.600 --> 51:07.320
You will put out word. I will
put out word, and I will find her.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.960
And instead of this poor
wooden cross... Tommy!

51:09.960 --> 51:13.000
..I will build a monument
to this little girl.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.400
Her mother can decide how big.

51:14.400 --> 51:17.080
It can be as big as fucking
Nelson's Column.

51:17.080 --> 51:19.440
That and £10,000.

51:19.440 --> 51:22.760
I will buy her off.
I will start looking today.

51:22.760 --> 51:24.120
Ruby will be well.

51:25.160 --> 51:27.280
She will be well!

51:27.280 --> 51:30.440
And I will undo the many wrongs
that I have done.

51:30.440 --> 51:32.960
Now that I'm without whisky
I can hear the spirits clearly,

51:32.960 --> 51:35.440
and they're saying Ruby
will be well, if I make amends.

51:35.440 --> 51:36.800
That is the conversation.

51:36.800 --> 51:39.720
If you want my help, I will help
you, Thomas, if you also pay me.

51:39.720 --> 51:42.120
Pay me and I will help you
to find her.

51:42.120 --> 51:44.240
I will pay you.
But I don't want money.

51:44.240 --> 51:46.840
I don't read the papers,
but I know there was a crash,

51:46.840 --> 51:49.240
and nothing is certain
and money loses value.

51:49.240 --> 51:51.960
Instead of money, give me gold.

51:51.960 --> 51:54.480
Gold. Yes, I will give you gold.

51:54.480 --> 51:56.920
In uncertain times,
gold is always certain.

51:56.920 --> 51:58.680
I will give you gold.

51:58.680 --> 52:00.880
And you will help me find
this woman.

52:00.880 --> 52:03.520
And she will spare my daughter.

52:03.520 --> 52:05.040
CRASH OF THUNDER

52:17.840 --> 52:20.480
VEHICLE APPROACHES

52:22.440 --> 52:24.440
Lizzie! Where the fuck were you?

52:25.960 --> 52:27.400
Where were you?

52:27.400 --> 52:29.040
Where the fuck were you?

52:34.480 --> 52:36.080
She's gone, Tommy.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.080
She's gone.

52:43.360 --> 52:45.320
Just now. At 5.17.

52:50.160 --> 52:53.520
You weren't fucking here, were you?

52:54.840 --> 52:55.960
Were you?

53:07.640 --> 53:10.880
It was before then, and she
was here, and then she was gone,

53:10.880 --> 53:13.040
and now she's gone to where
they've put the dead.

53:16.040 --> 53:18.000
They've put her with
the dead people.

53:28.720 --> 53:30.560
She was asking, just now, for you.

53:32.160 --> 53:33.200
But went...

53:35.320 --> 53:36.360
..at 5.17.

53:46.520 --> 53:48.080
I told her that you loved...

53:50.920 --> 53:53.000
I gave her your kiss goodbye.
