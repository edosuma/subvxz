WEBVTT

00:03.951 --> 00:06.283
The problem with the beginning
of the relationship...

00:06.453 --> 00:09.047
...is each person has their
own sexual timetable...

00:09.222 --> 00:12.521
...of what should happen when, that
the other person knows nothing about.

00:12.693 --> 00:15.958
That's why I think we need
some sort of sexual rule book...

00:16.129 --> 00:18.154
...where it's written down
and agreed upon...

00:18.332 --> 00:21.199
...sexual standard dating procedure.

00:21.368 --> 00:23.928
Know what I mean? So if there's
any problems, you can go:

00:24.104 --> 00:27.096
"Look, honey, I'm sorry,
but we've been out three times...

00:27.274 --> 00:29.640
...and according to Article 7,
Section 5...

00:29.843 --> 00:33.677
...there's got to be some physical
contact, as you can see right there.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.780
Otherwise,
I will report you to the board...

00:35.949 --> 00:38.008
...and they can issue a warrant
for an embrace."

00:43.523 --> 00:44.854
Wait a second. Wait a second.

00:45.025 --> 00:47.823
Then the butler says,
"I'm not cleaning it up.

00:47.995 --> 00:51.123
- I'm sick of cleaning!"
- That's funny. That's funny.

00:51.298 --> 00:53.732
"I'm sick of cleaning."
That's very funny.

00:54.034 --> 00:55.865
I've never seen a pilot script
this funny.

00:56.036 --> 00:58.027
- Yeah, it's funny.
- How funny is this?

00:58.205 --> 01:00.605
- It's funny.
- I mean, we're not stupid, right?

01:00.774 --> 01:04.107
- We know when something's funny.
- It cannot not be funny.

01:04.277 --> 01:06.939
Come on, let's stay with it.
We gotta finish this today.

01:07.114 --> 01:09.446
Maybe I should give it
to my therapist to read.

01:09.616 --> 01:12.483
- She's smart. I trust her.
- Maybe I'll give it to Elaine.

01:12.786 --> 01:15.812
We haven't brought the Elaine
character into the show yet.

01:15.989 --> 01:17.513
We should get her into this scene.

01:17.691 --> 01:20.592
Right. Right. Okay.

01:20.761 --> 01:23.389
"Elaine enters."

01:23.563 --> 01:24.791
Right.

01:25.332 --> 01:26.993
What does she say?

01:30.404 --> 01:33.396
- I don't know. What do women say?
- I don't know.

01:33.573 --> 01:36.804
I don't even know what they think.
That's why I'm in therapy.

01:37.411 --> 01:40.244
If we bring Elaine in, it'll be
so many people to keep track of.

01:40.414 --> 01:42.746
It's too hard. I forget where
everybody is standing.

01:42.916 --> 01:44.941
You, me, Kramer, the butler.
It's too much.

01:46.586 --> 01:48.315
- All right, forget Elaine.
- All right.

01:50.824 --> 01:52.052
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:54.795 --> 01:57.457
You are never gonna believe
who I just ran into today.

01:57.631 --> 01:59.963
- Who?
- Your old flame: Gail Cunningham.

02:00.133 --> 02:01.361
Did you talk to her?

02:01.535 --> 02:04.368
Well, I was on my way to the Y,
and I saw her coming towards me.

02:04.538 --> 02:05.903
I didn't know what to do.

02:06.073 --> 02:08.007
I remember you had
three dates with her...

02:08.175 --> 02:10.039
...and she wouldn't
kiss you good night.

02:10.210 --> 02:12.770
So now I'm thinking,
"What is my duty to my friend?

02:12.946 --> 02:15.039
Do I acknowledge her?
Do I ignore her?"

02:15.215 --> 02:17.615
- I mean, what is my responsibility?
- So, what happened?

02:17.784 --> 02:21.515
You know, she sees me
and she goes, "Hi, Kramer!"

02:21.688 --> 02:23.246
Like nothing happened.

02:23.423 --> 02:27.052
Like she never went three dates
with you and refused to kiss you.

02:27.227 --> 02:31.493
- Yeah, I know about the three dates.
- You know what I did? I snubbed her.

02:32.933 --> 02:36.528
- What do you mean you snubbed her?
- I walked by her, never said a word.

02:36.937 --> 02:39.804
- Right by her?
- Right by her.

02:39.973 --> 02:43.136
What do you say about a guy
like this, huh?

02:43.310 --> 02:47.747
You are some great friend. I'll tell you.
Snubbed her. Not that I condone it.

02:49.249 --> 02:52.116
I've never condoned snubbing
in my administration.

02:52.285 --> 02:54.310
But your loyalty is beyond question.

02:54.488 --> 02:56.615
Well, you know, she's lucky I was
in a good mood.

02:56.790 --> 02:58.257
Could have been a lot worse.

03:01.461 --> 03:04.555
- I'm not even in here.
- Yeah, I know.

03:04.731 --> 03:07.529
I thought there was gonna be
a character named "Elaine Benes."

03:07.701 --> 03:09.828
There were too many people
in the room.

03:10.003 --> 03:11.595
We couldn't keep track
of everybody:

03:11.772 --> 03:13.103
George and the butler...

03:13.273 --> 03:16.037
You "couldn't keep track
of everybody"?

03:16.209 --> 03:19.042
Well, we tried. We couldn't.
We didn't know how to...

03:20.313 --> 03:23.908
We couldn't write for a woman.
We didn't know what you would say.

03:24.351 --> 03:26.546
Even right now,
I know you're gonna say something.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.312
I have no idea what it is.

03:28.488 --> 03:30.718
You have no idea?

03:31.324 --> 03:33.019
Something derogatory?

03:34.194 --> 03:37.493
- I thought I'd find you here.
- Well, Gail Cunningham.

03:37.664 --> 03:39.655
- Hi, Gail.
- Hi, Elaine.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.960
- What is with your friend, Kramer?
- Why?

03:42.135 --> 03:43.363
He snubbed me.

03:44.137 --> 03:46.196
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

03:46.373 --> 03:49.570
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing. Hey, give me that.

03:49.743 --> 03:52.906
- I thought you finished.
- I took two bites. How am I finished?

03:53.079 --> 03:56.708
Plus, you're coming down with
something. You want me to get sick?

03:56.950 --> 03:58.178
Bite?

03:58.351 --> 04:00.216
I wanna know.
Why did Kramer do that?

04:00.387 --> 04:03.584
I don't know. Once he leaves the
building, he's out of my jurisdiction.

04:03.757 --> 04:07.022
- Tell him that I am mad at him.
- All right. So where you cooking now?

04:07.327 --> 04:09.261
- Pfieffer's.
- Oh, the power-lunch crowd.

04:09.996 --> 04:11.588
Nice shoes.

04:13.166 --> 04:15.191
- Thank you.
- Where did you get them?

04:15.368 --> 04:17.563
They're Botticelli's.

04:18.370 --> 04:22.432
Botticelli's. Look at you.
I'm afraid to go in there.

04:22.609 --> 04:24.099
Really?

04:24.444 --> 04:27.413
- Would you care to join us?
- No, no. I gotta get to the restaurant.

04:27.581 --> 04:28.980
- See you.
- See you.

04:30.884 --> 04:35.218
"Look at you with your Botticelli's."

04:35.922 --> 04:38.413
- That bothered you?
- Yes, it bothered me.

04:38.592 --> 04:40.890
So I bought a pair of shoes
at Botticelli's.

04:41.061 --> 04:42.585
I'm not allowed to shop there?

04:42.762 --> 04:44.696
That really embarrassed me.

04:44.865 --> 04:48.596
- It did?
- Yes. Couldn't you see that?

04:49.769 --> 04:50.997
No.

04:51.171 --> 04:53.366
This is why you're not in the pilot.

04:57.244 --> 05:00.941
Well, George, I think you're beginning
to get some perspective on things.

05:01.114 --> 05:02.741
I think we're making progress.

05:02.916 --> 05:06.181
- Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
- Good. Let's pick up on this next week.

05:06.353 --> 05:07.581
Great.

05:09.823 --> 05:13.554
By the way, did you get a chance
to read the script?

05:13.727 --> 05:15.991
Yes. Yes, I did.

05:16.162 --> 05:17.789
Well, what did you think?

05:17.964 --> 05:19.864
It was...

05:20.033 --> 05:21.295
...good.

05:24.004 --> 05:25.631
You didn't like it?

05:26.373 --> 05:27.670
Well, no...

05:27.841 --> 05:31.277
I can't believe this. What was wrong
with it? What didn't you like about it?

05:31.444 --> 05:32.502
It wasn't funny.

05:32.679 --> 05:35.477
It wasn't funny?
What, are you kidding?

05:35.649 --> 05:37.947
No. I didn't find it funny.

05:38.118 --> 05:41.815
You didn't find it funny?
This is what I'm paying for?

05:41.988 --> 05:45.617
Well, that whole story line about a guy
who gets into a car accident...

05:45.792 --> 05:49.421
...doesn't have insurance, so the judge
sentences him to be a butler?

05:49.596 --> 05:51.120
I didn't really buy that.

05:51.298 --> 05:57.237
Let me tell you who did buy it.
We pitched this story...

05:57.404 --> 06:02.364
...to Russell Dalrymple, the president
of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.476
If you're going to be
in a creative field...

06:04.644 --> 06:07.272
...you're gonna have to learn how
to deal with criticism.

06:07.447 --> 06:08.914
How's this for criticism?

06:10.250 --> 06:13.276
You stink.
How do you like that criticism?

06:13.453 --> 06:16.945
You know what's funny to me?
That diploma up on the wall.

06:17.123 --> 06:19.887
That is my idea of comedy.

06:20.060 --> 06:22.392
You sitting here,
telling people what to do.

06:22.562 --> 06:25.998
- I think you'd better go.
- I'm going baby. I'm going!

06:27.200 --> 06:29.031
It's Jerry's fault.

06:30.036 --> 06:34.496
He took out all my good lines.
He's such a control freak.

06:38.211 --> 06:42.170
So you send me to this therapist to
help me with my emotional disorders...

06:42.349 --> 06:44.510
...and she criticizes our script.

06:44.684 --> 06:46.675
What kind of a therapist is that?

06:46.853 --> 06:49.378
Well, I guess she didn't
think it was funny.

06:49.556 --> 06:53.458
Oh, she didn't think it was funny.
What is she, Rowan and Martin?

06:54.094 --> 06:55.994
We're supposed to meet
with NBC tomorrow.

06:56.162 --> 06:57.993
She completely shattered
my confidence.

06:58.164 --> 07:00.394
And I'm paying for this.
She's my employee.

07:00.567 --> 07:05.504
- I thought your mother's paying for it.
- And she slaves to earn every penny...

07:05.672 --> 07:08.800
...so that someday I might be able
to walk up to a woman and say:

07:08.975 --> 07:12.536
"Yes, I'm bald,
but I'm still a good person."

07:12.712 --> 07:15.306
He's right. It's not her place
to criticize the script.

07:15.482 --> 07:18.383
Which reminds me. What did you
think of it? You never told me

07:19.252 --> 07:21.516
- What did I think of it?
- Yeah.

07:23.023 --> 07:24.820
Hey, buddy,
I got something to tell you.

07:24.991 --> 07:28.222
Now, one second. You won't get off
that easy. Tell me what you thought.

07:28.395 --> 07:31.091
- Well, you know...
- I just kissed Gail Cunningham.

07:35.502 --> 07:37.732
- You what?
- Yeah, I kissed her.

07:37.904 --> 07:40.600
- You kissed her?
- Right on the mouth.

07:40.774 --> 07:42.401
What kind of great friend are you?

07:42.575 --> 07:44.440
How do you go
from snubbing to kissing?

07:44.611 --> 07:48.411
I saw her outside the Y. She came up
to me, she started yelling...

07:48.581 --> 07:52.278
...because I snubbed her.
Then we started talking a little bit...

07:52.452 --> 07:56.081
...and I walked her to her building.
And just before I left...

07:56.256 --> 07:59.225
...I put my arm around her waist.
I pulled her to me...

07:59.392 --> 08:01.451
...and I planted one.

08:03.496 --> 08:06.158
- What did she do?
- She kissed me back.

08:06.332 --> 08:09.961
I don't get this. I go out with this girl
three times, she won't shake my hand.

08:10.136 --> 08:12.195
Why is she kissing you?

08:12.372 --> 08:16.570
Because I snubbed her.
You see? Women, they like that.

08:16.743 --> 08:18.176
Yes, I understand women.

08:18.344 --> 08:21.802
The snub is good.
They love the snub.

08:22.449 --> 08:24.974
No they don't. I tried that once.

08:25.151 --> 08:27.551
I snubbed for a year. Nothing.

08:27.720 --> 08:31.349
Every woman I saw, I snubbed.
You never saw people so pleased.

08:33.493 --> 08:37.361
So I understand you're buying
new shoes now at Botticelli's.

08:37.530 --> 08:39.964
What? Who told you that?

08:40.133 --> 08:41.861
Gail Cunningham.

08:42.602 --> 08:45.662
I don't understand. Why is this woman
talking about my shoes?

08:45.839 --> 08:48.865
Why are my shoes a topic
of conversation?

08:49.042 --> 08:51.636
We were just talking,
and she mentioned...

08:51.811 --> 08:54.177
...how you're buying your
shoes now at Botticelli's.

08:54.347 --> 08:57.680
How I'm buying my shoes now
at Botticelli's.

08:57.851 --> 08:59.375
Did you hear this?

09:01.154 --> 09:03.054
So what?

09:03.656 --> 09:08.958
So what? She is talking about my
shoes. She is discussing my shoes.

09:09.129 --> 09:13.463
It is nobody's business where
I buy my shoes.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:23.877 --> 09:25.868
- Hey, Gail?
- Yeah.

09:26.846 --> 09:27.904
Elaine.

09:28.081 --> 09:30.174
- Why are you talking about my shoes?
- What?

09:30.350 --> 09:33.319
My Botticelli shoes. You've been
talking about my Botticelli shoes.

09:33.486 --> 09:34.748
What are you talking about?

09:34.921 --> 09:38.823
Did you or did you not tell Kramer
that I got my shoes at Botticelli's?

09:38.992 --> 09:40.459
Too spicy. He wants another one.

09:40.627 --> 09:43.994
- You got that pasta primavera?
- Elaine, I am very busy here.

09:44.230 --> 09:45.959
Who else have you mentioned
my shoes to?

09:46.132 --> 09:48.930
I want to know why my footwear
is your conversation?

09:49.435 --> 09:51.995
I am not discussing this.
This is insane.

09:52.172 --> 09:53.867
You got that pasta primavera?
Let's go!

10:02.715 --> 10:04.945
Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.

10:05.718 --> 10:09.017
Sorry for the delay.
Enjoy your lunch.

10:09.989 --> 10:11.456
- Well, come in. Come in.
- Hi.

10:11.624 --> 10:12.852
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:13.026 --> 10:14.493
Sorry to make you come up here...

10:14.661 --> 10:17.425
...but I wasn't feeling well
enough to go back to the office.

10:17.597 --> 10:20.566
Well, it's the only chance I have
to meet with you this week.

10:20.733 --> 10:22.462
- Are you all right?
- It's my stomach.

10:22.635 --> 10:26.162
There must have been something in
the pasta primavera I had for lunch.

10:26.573 --> 10:28.598
- Where did you eat?
- Pfeiffer's.

10:29.909 --> 10:32.469
- I know the chef there.
- Food is usually terrific.

10:32.645 --> 10:34.840
My cousin worked for Bouchard's.

10:35.014 --> 10:38.074
They used to use the bouillabaise
for a toilet.

10:38.985 --> 10:40.509
What are you saying?

10:40.687 --> 10:43.155
Well, you didn't hear it from me,
but needless to say...

10:43.323 --> 10:46.156
...if you go in there,
stick with the consommé.

10:46.492 --> 10:48.960
We better get started.
My daughter's gonna be here soon.

10:49.128 --> 10:50.356
Oh, you have a daughter.

10:50.530 --> 10:53.260
- She just turned 15 last week.
- That's a fun age.

10:53.433 --> 10:54.661
Yeah.

10:55.235 --> 10:56.463
All right.

10:57.437 --> 11:00.929
The script. Now, I've read
this thing three times.

11:01.107 --> 11:02.335
Yeah?

11:03.376 --> 11:05.367
And every time I read it...

11:09.148 --> 11:10.410
What?

11:12.018 --> 11:14.418
- Excuse me for a second.
- What?

11:14.587 --> 11:17.852
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol?
I keep them in my wallet.

11:18.424 --> 11:20.449
You think he liked it?

11:25.898 --> 11:27.422
I'm not sure.

11:37.610 --> 11:40.773
- What was that dish he said...
- Pasta primavera.

11:42.382 --> 11:44.907
You know,
"primavera" is Italian for "spring."

11:45.084 --> 11:47.382
- No?
- Yeah.

11:48.554 --> 11:50.818
Really, I'm terribly sorry. It's just...

11:52.492 --> 11:54.289
...all of a sudden, it just hit me.

11:55.261 --> 11:58.856
So you were saying,
about the script.

11:59.032 --> 12:00.624
Right. The script.

12:00.833 --> 12:02.164
Your script needs...

12:04.304 --> 12:05.862
It needs...

12:07.006 --> 12:08.564
- More jokes?
- Another ending?

12:08.741 --> 12:10.402
A different name for the butler?

12:17.050 --> 12:18.881
Maybe we should go.

12:19.619 --> 12:21.246
We haven't heard his notes yet.

12:21.421 --> 12:23.719
We don't know how he feels
about our work.

12:25.258 --> 12:31.254
Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:32.198 --> 12:36.760
I can't listen to anymore of this.
The guy's losing a lung in there.

12:39.472 --> 12:40.700
Hello.

12:40.907 --> 12:42.898
- Hi.
- I'm Molly.

12:43.076 --> 12:44.737
- I'm Jerry.
- George.

12:44.911 --> 12:46.936
We're discussing our script
with your father.

12:47.113 --> 12:48.740
He just read it.

12:50.583 --> 12:55.577
- Daddy, are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, sweetie, I'm fine.

12:58.124 --> 13:01.287
- So you live with your mother?
- Yeah.

13:02.061 --> 13:05.963
Divorce is very difficult,
especially on the kid

13:06.132 --> 13:08.930
Of course, I'm the result of my parents
having stayed together.

13:09.102 --> 13:10.262
So you never know.

13:10.870 --> 13:12.201
Crapshoot.

13:12.372 --> 13:14.101
Dad, you all right?
What's the matter?

13:14.273 --> 13:17.299
- It's just a stomach thing.
- Yuck.

13:17.477 --> 13:19.411
We're gonna have to do this
some other time.

13:19.579 --> 13:22.673
So if you give me your number,
I'll call you later.

13:24.650 --> 13:27.619
Suddenly I'm in the mood
for pasta primavera myself.

13:38.831 --> 13:41.391
Get a good look, Costanza?

13:44.837 --> 13:48.603
- What were you doing?
- It's not my fault. You poked me.

13:48.775 --> 13:52.040
You're supposed to just
take a peek after a poke.

13:52.211 --> 13:55.146
You were like you just put a quarter
in one of those metal things...

13:55.314 --> 13:56.975
...on top
of the Empire State Building

13:57.150 --> 13:59.675
It was cleavage.
I couldn't look away.

13:59.852 --> 14:03.310
What, am I waiting to win an Oscar
here? This is all I have in my life.

14:03.823 --> 14:07.486
Looking at cleavage is like looking
at the sun. You don't stare at it.

14:07.660 --> 14:09.594
It's too risky.

14:09.962 --> 14:13.193
- You get a sense of it, then look away.
- All right.

14:13.599 --> 14:16.329
He caught me in a cleavage peek.
So big deal.

14:16.502 --> 14:18.993
Who wouldn't look at cleavage?
She's got nice cleavage.

14:19.205 --> 14:21.537
- That's why I poked.
- Why I peeked.

14:22.008 --> 14:23.669
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:24.377 --> 14:26.937
- What is with your friend Elaine?
- What?

14:27.113 --> 14:30.640
She comes to my restaurant,
comes right in my kitchen...

14:30.817 --> 14:33.308
...starts complaining
that I'm talking about her shoes.

14:33.519 --> 14:36.352
- She did?
- Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.

14:36.522 --> 14:38.581
I don't like people coming
into my kitchen.

14:38.758 --> 14:41.955
I think she sneezed all
over someone's pasta primavera.

14:42.128 --> 14:45.222
Someone might have gotten sick
because of her.

14:49.936 --> 14:52.370
- Pasta primavera?
- Is that what she said?

14:53.706 --> 14:58.541
Hey, she's something, huh? She's
a wild one. She's wearing me out.

14:58.711 --> 15:01.202
- She is?
- She's real sensual.

15:01.380 --> 15:04.213
You know, with the cooking and all.

15:12.091 --> 15:13.649
Hello?

15:13.993 --> 15:15.221
Hi, Stu.

15:15.394 --> 15:17.157
- From NBC?
- Yeah.

15:17.330 --> 15:19.127
What's going on?

15:19.465 --> 15:22.229
What? Really?

15:22.502 --> 15:24.333
Oh, my God.

15:24.570 --> 15:26.697
Did he give you a reason?

15:27.073 --> 15:28.301
Oh, boy.

15:28.474 --> 15:31.068
Okay. All right. Thanks.

15:31.410 --> 15:33.935
Dalrymple just canceled the pilot.

15:36.983 --> 15:39.417
If you hadn't gone there,
this wouldn't have happened.

15:39.585 --> 15:42.452
I don't like people talking about
my shoes behind my back, okay?

15:42.622 --> 15:44.419
My shoes are my business.

15:44.590 --> 15:47.923
You two shouldn't have been looking
at some 15-year-old's cleavage.

15:48.094 --> 15:51.086
- He poked me!
- There was cleavage in the area.

15:52.865 --> 15:55.129
That's a reflex.
Cleavage, poke. Cleavage, poke.

15:55.701 --> 15:57.100
But she was 15.

15:57.270 --> 16:00.034
You don't consider age
in the face of cleavage.

16:00.206 --> 16:03.664
This occurs on a molecular level.
You can't control it.

16:03.843 --> 16:05.674
We're like some kind of weird fish...

16:05.845 --> 16:08.473
...where the eyes operate
independently of the head.

16:08.648 --> 16:11.139
What's the difference?
What are we gonna do now?

16:11.317 --> 16:13.751
He won't take our calls.
We can't get into his office.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.582
You know what we could do?
He eats at Pfeiffer's.

16:16.756 --> 16:19.748
We can have Gail call us when he's
there, go there and talk to him.

16:19.926 --> 16:22.394
- You're on to something.
- The whole thing is so stupid.

16:22.562 --> 16:25.963
Like he wouldn't do the same thing
if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.

16:26.365 --> 16:28.890
- Well, maybe not Elaine, but...
- No.

16:29.735 --> 16:31.259
- Somebody like Gail, though.
- Yeah.

16:31.437 --> 16:33.905
What? What do you mean Gail?

16:34.073 --> 16:35.472
What?

16:35.641 --> 16:38.439
Hey, Kramer, listen,
I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor.

16:38.611 --> 16:41.478
The next time Russell Dalrymple
comes in the restaurant...

16:41.647 --> 16:44.946
...ask her if she would call me.
- All right, I'll call her right now.

16:47.386 --> 16:48.751
What do you mean Gail?

16:48.921 --> 16:52.652
You don't think I can attract attention,
put asses in the seats?

16:53.993 --> 16:57.759
Look, sweetheart,
you know you've got it all.

16:57.964 --> 16:59.625
But let's face it...

17:00.066 --> 17:01.795
- She said she'll do it.
- All right.

17:02.034 --> 17:03.433
- Great. Beautiful.
- Beautiful.

17:03.603 --> 17:04.934
But she wants the shoes.

17:05.104 --> 17:07.698
- What?
- She says she wants those shoes.

17:07.873 --> 17:10.340
She wants my shoes?

17:10.509 --> 17:12.271
What kind of person is this?

17:12.444 --> 17:16.108
- She is not getting them.
- Come on, I'll buy you another pair.

17:16.281 --> 17:18.910
No, these were the last pair
of these that they had.

17:19.085 --> 17:22.213
- I'll get you another just like it.
- But these were the only cool ones.

17:22.387 --> 17:25.846
Don't you see how everybody likes
them and everybody talks about them?

17:29.662 --> 17:31.357
Elaine...

17:33.499 --> 17:38.163
...this pilot, it doesn't matter to me.
It's not me I'm concerned about...

17:39.005 --> 17:42.532
...it's my mother. She's already been
in the hospital this year.

17:42.708 --> 17:45.700
- Yeah, because she caught you...
- Never mind!

17:45.878 --> 17:49.109
Oh, come on. Wait a second.
This whole thing is ridiculous.

17:49.281 --> 17:51.408
How do I even know she wears
the same size?

17:51.584 --> 17:54.052
- All right, what size are you?
- Seven and a half.

17:54.220 --> 17:55.687
Bingo.

18:02.461 --> 18:04.395
Sauce this.

18:10.169 --> 18:11.397
Yeah, he's here.

18:11.804 --> 18:16.173
Oh, and one more thing,
bring the shoes.

18:23.949 --> 18:27.214
Hey, will you look!

18:27.386 --> 18:29.752
Fancy meeting you here.

18:29.922 --> 18:31.583
Hello.

18:31.757 --> 18:35.090
Pasta primavera. Back on the horse.

18:36.529 --> 18:39.726
It's funny, after the pilot got canceled,
we hadn't heard from you.

18:39.899 --> 18:43.062
- We didn't hear anything.
- We were wondering what happened.

18:43.235 --> 18:47.069
Well, it just didn't seem to be
the right project for us right now.

18:57.383 --> 18:59.408
So, what were you saying?

19:00.352 --> 19:03.287
The show. Because if it had anything
at all to do...

19:03.456 --> 19:05.447
...with what you perceived as me...

19:05.658 --> 19:08.627
...leering at your daughter,
I really have to take issue with that.

19:08.794 --> 19:11.285
- I did not leer. Did I leer?
- No leer.

19:13.232 --> 19:14.961
Excuse me.

19:15.134 --> 19:18.399
- Are you using that ketchup?
- No.

19:24.076 --> 19:26.840
Because if I'm looking...

19:27.012 --> 19:30.413
...straight ahead and something
enters my field of vision...

19:30.583 --> 19:32.915
...that's merely a happenstance.

19:33.085 --> 19:34.746
Look, under the circumstances...

19:34.920 --> 19:38.515
...I don't really feel that we should be
in business together.

19:39.191 --> 19:40.749
Here's your ketchup back.

19:41.193 --> 19:45.095
You know, I had the hardest time
trying to get some out. I just kept...

19:45.264 --> 19:47.664
...pounding and pounding
on the bottom of it.

19:47.833 --> 19:50.358
- Do you ever have any trouble?
- No.

19:51.604 --> 19:54.698
Do you have a ketchup secret?

19:54.874 --> 19:56.341
No...

19:58.310 --> 20:00.369
Don't have a ketchup secret.

20:01.947 --> 20:04.745
Because if you do have
a ketchup secret...

20:04.917 --> 20:08.785
...I would really, really like to know
what it is.

20:18.464 --> 20:19.988
Field of vision, huh?

20:21.700 --> 20:22.928
How's everything?

20:23.102 --> 20:25.366
- Really good.
- This pasta primavera is fabulous.

20:25.538 --> 20:28.735
- Very tasty.
- How did it go with that NBC guy?

20:28.908 --> 20:30.842
Great. Pilot is back on.

20:31.010 --> 20:33.638
In fact, Elaine's going out
with him tomorrow night.

20:35.614 --> 20:37.047
Hey, listen, Elaine...

20:37.216 --> 20:39.741
...if Russell mentions anything
about the pilot...

20:39.919 --> 20:42.444
...you'll, of course,
tell him how much you liked it.

20:42.621 --> 20:46.751
You know I happen to have the script
right here with me...

20:46.926 --> 20:49.019
...and on page three, for example...

20:49.195 --> 20:52.323
...suppose the Elaine character
comes in wearing...

20:52.498 --> 20:53.897
...a low-cut dress...

20:54.066 --> 20:58.594
...and the butler is very distracted
and can't work.

20:58.971 --> 21:02.463
That kind of comedy,
that's a little broad for us.

21:03.075 --> 21:05.043
I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.

21:05.477 --> 21:07.968
- Well, it's a funny idea.
- It's funny.

21:08.147 --> 21:10.081
- Come on, funny is funny.
- Funny's funny.

21:10.249 --> 21:12.479
We're here to entertain, right?

21:13.419 --> 21:14.818
All right.

21:15.020 --> 21:17.488
Well, maybe I'll mention it
to Russell tomorrow night.

21:17.656 --> 21:19.681
- lf you can.
- Yeah.

21:19.859 --> 21:22.692
- Where is he taking you, by the way?
- Bouchard's, on 53rd.

21:28.968 --> 21:31.903
I think what he's trying to say is,
"Get the bouillabaise."

21:43.816 --> 21:46.910
Men are obsessed with cleavage,
women are obsessed with shoes.

21:47.086 --> 21:49.611
It's the same for both sexes.
It doesn't matter...

21:49.788 --> 21:52.188
...how many times
we've seen these things.

21:52.358 --> 21:54.918
Every time these objects
are presented to us...

21:55.094 --> 21:57.119
...we have to look.
We cannot not look.

21:57.296 --> 21:59.890
To men,
cleavage is like the nearest thing...

22:00.065 --> 22:02.795
...to a nearby UFO landing.
That's what it is.

22:02.968 --> 22:06.734
Women, if women buy a pair
of shoes that they really love...

22:06.906 --> 22:09.340
...this is like boarding the alien ship.

22:09.508 --> 22:11.339
It's possible that aliens
have landed...

22:11.510 --> 22:13.978
...and they haven't been able
to get our attention...

22:14.146 --> 22:16.671
...because we're so preoccupied
with cleavage and shoes.
