18:18.680 --> 18:20.762
You put a guard
in the hospital last year.

Holy crap.

It was Claire.

She died in that hospital.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.089
How is that possible
with her power?

22:40.320 --> 22:41.367
I don't know.
I've been asking myself

22:41.440 --> 22:42.885
that question for the past year.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.803
I should have
reached out to her.

what happened?

not know how she died?

supposed to know the plan.

who may have the answers.

has digitized her power,

23:22.400 --> 23:24.209
