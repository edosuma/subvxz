00:18.168 --> 00:21.129
Well, but, we'll find out.

00:21.130 --> 00:24.090
Uh, uh, I'm glad
you're in a good mood tonight.

00:24.091 --> 00:28.386
Uh, my next guest
is a very funny comic,

00:28.387 --> 00:31.389
making his first
<i>Tonight Show</i> appearance.

00:31.390 --> 00:32.557
He's a former Bostonian.

00:32.558 --> 00:36.853
Will you please give a warm
welcome to Clay Appuzzo?

02:16.245 --> 02:17.828
Congratulations, ladies.

02:17.829 --> 02:19.914
Congrats, by the way.
Big court win.

02:19.915 --> 02:21.541
Abortion is legal.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.417
Yes.

02:22.418 --> 02:25.169
Clap for that.
Clap for that, guys.

02:25.170 --> 02:27.338
That's a big win for us too.

02:27.339 --> 02:28.215
That's fantastic, man.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.258
How pissed are
back-alley abortionists?

02:30.259 --> 02:33.177
There goes six months
of veterinary school

02:33.178 --> 02:34.345
right down the drain.

02:35.847 --> 02:37.348
My mom had six children.
I'm one of six.

02:37.349 --> 02:40.393
And according to her,
we were all accidents.

02:40.394 --> 02:43.229
Six accidental pregnancies.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.897
We figured it out by now,
haven't we?

02:44.898 --> 02:46.983
This whole penis-vagina
conundrum, right?

02:46.984 --> 02:49.735
It's not the Manhattan Project.

02:49.736 --> 02:51.821
Not a bunch of scientists
standing around a baby

02:51.822 --> 02:54.156
in a room going, well, I-I don't
know how this got here.

02:54.157 --> 02:56.534
I'm not quite sure
I understand.

02:56.535 --> 02:58.202
Yes, Professor Einstein?

02:58.203 --> 03:00.329
Um, yeah, I just... I have...

03:00.330 --> 03:02.290
I just have a hunch,
if you will.

03:02.291 --> 03:04.959
Maybe, perhaps, the babies
are coming from the fucking?

03:04.960 --> 03:06.711
Do you think it's from
the fucking?

03:06.712 --> 03:08.879
That's just my opinion.

03:16.013 --> 03:19.265
Watch out.
I got my eye on you.

03:23.687 --> 03:25.104
Yes.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.897
Tastes like tens and twenties.

03:26.898 --> 03:29.525
Hey, Rob.

03:29.526 --> 03:30.818
Hey, Goldie.

03:30.819 --> 03:33.279
So you killed it
at the Store last night.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.114
You know, I-I wanted
to be here,

03:35.115 --> 03:36.574
but, you know,
the only open spot

03:36.575 --> 03:37.950
wasn't until after one.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.536
Well, a lot of good comics
go up after one.

03:40.537 --> 03:41.954
Oh, I agree.
I just, you know,

03:41.955 --> 03:42.914
I have to be up
at work at seven.

03:42.915 --> 03:45.082
Totally understand.

03:45.083 --> 03:45.876
I just don't give a shit.

03:48.587 --> 03:50.671
Uh, okay, Goldie, well, it's
just one fucking night, right?

03:50.672 --> 03:53.090
Caught my ex getting a blow job
in our office.

03:53.091 --> 03:54.759
Took a fountain pen
and stuck it through his hand.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.469
That was one fucking night too.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.430
Okay.

04:04.519 --> 04:04.936
Goldie.

04:04.937 --> 04:06.604
What the...

04:06.605 --> 04:08.230
Rob, uh,
he made a mistake.

04:08.231 --> 04:11.859
And although I find
the punishment harsh,

04:11.860 --> 04:13.027
I do find it just.

04:13.028 --> 04:14.570
Can I have his five minutes,
please?

04:17.199 --> 04:18.866
What's up, Carl?

04:18.867 --> 04:20.451
People sitting in my booth's
what's up.

04:20.452 --> 04:22.119
Fuck.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.954
Can I sit you somewhere else,
please, just for tonight?

04:23.955 --> 04:24.915
You know who I'm bringing
here tonight?

04:24.916 --> 04:26.082
- Charlie...
- Callas.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.376
Yeah, that's right,
smart guy.

04:28.377 --> 04:29.710
You're gonna tell
an American treasure

04:29.711 --> 04:31.253
he's gotta sit in the back?

04:31.254 --> 04:32.797
All right.

04:32.798 --> 04:34.173
Yeah, that's been my booth
since the joint opened.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.633
Should fuckin' know better.

04:35.634 --> 04:36.676
Prick.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.386
Hi.

04:38.387 --> 04:40.429
How 'bout some free drinks?
Does that sound good?

04:52.568 --> 04:54.985
Where the fuck
are my onion rings?

04:54.986 --> 04:56.862
They're not drinking
if they don't get their salt.

04:58.323 --> 05:00.658
Somebody call me
when Clay goes up.

05:00.659 --> 05:02.952
Drunk dentist with
a pair of fondue forks...

05:09.668 --> 05:11.335
Uh, what else?

05:11.336 --> 05:13.421
Oh, I got myself a pet rock.
He's very sweet.

05:13.422 --> 05:15.423
He was a rescue.
I rescued him off the street.

05:15.424 --> 05:18.259
He was a stray.

05:18.260 --> 05:19.719
Pet rocks are great.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.595
He's very protective of me.

05:20.596 --> 05:22.596
I was not expecting that.
It's funny.

05:22.597 --> 05:23.848
Anytime my boyfriend
says something mean,

05:23.849 --> 05:27.518
he just jumps out of my hand
and hurls himself at his head.

05:28.854 --> 05:30.104
Try to get him to stop,
but he won't.

05:30.105 --> 05:30.939
Show us your tits!

05:30.940 --> 05:33.524
You first, sir.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.695
Ladies and gentlemen,
chivalry is not dead.

05:37.696 --> 05:39.071
Hey, why don't you suck my dick?

05:39.072 --> 05:40.865
Oh, what a sweet invitation.

05:40.866 --> 05:42.408
I have not been asked out
on a date in a long time.

05:44.828 --> 05:47.037
Oh, there's a bunch
of y'all, huh?

05:47.038 --> 05:48.372
So what's the occasion?

05:48.373 --> 05:48.915
It's my bachelor party.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.916
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.501
Well, what are you doing
in here?

05:52.502 --> 05:54.378
That hooker in the trunk
ain't gonna bury herself.

05:56.715 --> 05:57.882
A man comes into my office.

05:57.883 --> 05:59.008
He says,
can I use your Dictaphone?

05:59.009 --> 06:00.593
I say, no,
you use your finger

06:00.594 --> 06:01.635
like everybody else.

06:01.636 --> 06:04.889
Come on, you bastards,
get off your high horses.

06:04.890 --> 06:06.182
Hey, Goldie, sit.

06:06.183 --> 06:07.558
Ah, that's a funny one.

06:07.559 --> 06:08.393
Adam Proteau.
What do you think?

06:08.394 --> 06:10.519
I think I got
more hair on my lip

06:10.520 --> 06:11.729
than he does on his nuts.

06:11.730 --> 06:12.355
Can you stick him
in The Cellar?

06:12.355 --> 06:13.148
Fleischer and Stephenson

06:13.149 --> 06:15.566
open mic'd for over a year.

06:15.567 --> 06:16.901
Trust me, if they'd spent
a little more time and sweat

06:16.902 --> 06:19.111
building the <i>Titanic,</i>

06:19.112 --> 06:20.654
the word would still
just mean "big."

06:20.655 --> 06:21.573
Hey, Kay,

06:21.573 --> 06:22.532
another Rob Roy, neat

06:22.532 --> 06:23.074
for my friend Carl, huh?

06:23.075 --> 06:25.284
Hey, pal, nice shirt.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.411
Who... who'd you blow, Don Ho,
for that shirt?

06:30.749 --> 06:32.249
Yes.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.043
There you go.

06:34.044 --> 06:35.836
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

06:39.925 --> 06:41.509
<i>Well,
we'll... we'll find out.</i>

06:41.510 --> 06:44.386
<i>Uh, I'm glad you're in
a good mood tonight.</i>

06:44.387 --> 06:47.556
<i>Uh, my next guest
is a very funny comic,</i>

06:47.557 --> 06:50.267
<i>making his first</i>
Tonight Show <i>appearance.</i>

06:50.268 --> 06:52.937
<i>Uh, he's a former Bostonian.</i>

06:52.938 --> 06:56.190
<i>Will you please give a warm
welcome to Clay Appuzzo?</i>

07:00.737 --> 07:01.613
<i>Thank you.</i>

07:01.614 --> 07:03.155
<i>Everyone, I... look,</i>

07:03.156 --> 07:04.240
<i>I just want to...
I want to be clear.</i>

07:04.241 --> 07:05.950
<i>I'm not just a Bostonian.</i>

07:05.951 --> 07:07.785
<i>I'm an Italian Bostonian.</i>

07:07.786 --> 07:10.454
<i>We still talk with our hands,
but we only use one finger.</i>

07:12.082 --> 07:13.749
<i>So I grew up with
a lot of brothers and sisters.</i>

07:13.750 --> 07:17.628
<i>Italians used to have
big families before television.</i>

07:17.629 --> 07:19.880
<i>But now they only have kids
when there's nothing good on.</i>

07:22.259 --> 07:23.801
But that's what they do,
Italian parents.

07:23.802 --> 07:25.427
They send mixed messages.

07:25.428 --> 07:28.472
You mess up in school,
Dad gives you the belt.

07:28.473 --> 07:31.100
But then two minutes later, Mom
comes in with a bowl of pasta.

07:32.811 --> 07:34.562
So, I mean, that's how
Italians love to do it.

07:34.563 --> 07:36.021
They like to follow
their violence

07:36.022 --> 07:37.189
with a little something
to eat, right?

07:37.190 --> 07:39.483
So...

07:39.484 --> 07:41.902
<i>May I suggest the Alfredo...</i>

07:41.903 --> 07:43.070
<i>With your beating?</i>

07:43.071 --> 07:45.030
<i>The cream sauce</i>
<i>really soaks up the tears.</i>

07:45.031 --> 07:45.991
Hey, you do know
when Arnie flashes the light,

07:45.992 --> 07:48.117
that means to get
the fuck off stage, right?

07:48.118 --> 07:50.327
I get off the stage when
they stop fucking laughing.

07:50.328 --> 07:51.288
Uh, laughing, Ralph,
is the noise that people make

07:51.289 --> 07:53.372
when they hear something funny.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.873
Shut the fuck up, Sully.

07:54.874 --> 07:55.372
- How's he doing?
- He's killing.

07:55.373 --> 07:56.542
Great.

07:56.543 --> 07:57.835
"Great"?

07:57.836 --> 07:59.587
That's not your "great" face,
Bill.

07:59.588 --> 08:01.088
That's the "why don't Johnny
fuckin' love me" face.

08:01.089 --> 08:02.548
How did they not shoot you
in 'Nam?

08:02.549 --> 08:03.882
There's nothing but bamboo

08:03.883 --> 08:04.759
over there;
what tree could you

08:04.760 --> 08:06.760
have possibly
fuckin' hid behind?

08:06.761 --> 08:07.637
Yeah, are black hippos sacred
over there?

08:07.638 --> 08:09.680
- Shh, shh.
- First of all, y'all saw

08:09.681 --> 08:10.931
the pictures,
I was lean and mean in 'Nam.

08:10.932 --> 08:11.600
Charlie was terrified of me.

08:11.601 --> 08:13.934
Called me "The Black Beast."

08:13.935 --> 08:14.769
Black beast, that's what
they call you at McDonald's.

08:14.770 --> 08:16.270
- Black beast.
- Fuck you, Sully.

08:16.271 --> 08:17.855
Always talking shit.
You know what?

08:17.856 --> 08:18.315
When the revolution come,
motherfuckers,

08:18.315 --> 08:19.274
you on your own.

08:19.275 --> 08:21.025
Guys, I'm trying to hear Clay.

08:21.026 --> 08:22.359
Hear what?

08:22.360 --> 08:24.028
His act is practically
a sing-along.

08:24.029 --> 08:24.613
Bill, I love you
like a raging yeast infection,

08:24.614 --> 08:25.946
but shut the fuck up.

08:25.947 --> 08:27.156
- Gross.
- Mm.

08:27.157 --> 08:29.199
<i>Come on over.</i>

08:30.077 --> 08:32.453
Oh, my God!

08:32.453 --> 08:34.663
What?

08:34.664 --> 08:35.624
- Oh, my God. He got the couch.
- Wow.

08:35.625 --> 08:38.250
Suddenly I don't feel
so pretty anymore.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.960
Holy shit!
Holy shit!

08:39.961 --> 08:40.754
Whatever.

08:40.755 --> 08:43.212
Wow.

08:43.214 --> 08:44.298
Yeah, get your bitter ass
out of here, Bill.

08:49.054 --> 08:51.889
Got the couch.

08:51.890 --> 08:53.891
That's all she wrote.

08:53.892 --> 08:56.393
I told Frank
Johnny'd eat him up.

09:02.734 --> 09:04.443
<i>How are you?</i>

09:04.444 --> 09:05.320
<i>Ah.</i>

09:05.321 --> 09:06.820
<i>He smells good.</i>

09:06.821 --> 09:08.572
<i>He always has.</i>

09:08.573 --> 09:10.699
<i>Don't get too close.
You'll lose a finger.</i>

09:10.700 --> 09:12.284
Very funny stuff.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.411
So you get back to Boston much?

09:14.412 --> 09:16.538
<i>Well, I-I try to make it back
for all the major funerals.</i>

09:16.539 --> 09:18.248
<i>Ah, uh-huh.</i>

09:18.249 --> 09:20.125
<i>Yeah, you can fly free</i>
<i>when someone dies</i>

09:20.126 --> 09:22.044
<i>so I try to plan my vacations
around my dying relatives.</i>

09:23.588 --> 09:26.340
Oh, Uncle Sal's not doing
so good, aye?

09:26.341 --> 09:28.425
Oh, well, that's... that's sad.
That's very sad.

09:28.426 --> 09:30.719
Any chance he'll be, uh,
hanging in there

09:30.720 --> 09:32.137
till opening day at Fenway?

09:55.620 --> 09:58.414
What do you think happens
when we die?

09:58.415 --> 10:00.541
Well, Cass,

10:00.542 --> 10:02.167
I don't really know.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.253
Shut up.

10:04.254 --> 10:07.464
Don't make fun of my accent.
I'm working on it.

10:07.465 --> 10:10.300
Oh.

10:10.301 --> 10:13.429
Well, I think it was Buddha
that said it best.

10:14.889 --> 10:16.974
"You shit yourself.

10:16.975 --> 10:20.436
And then it's anybody's guess."

10:20.437 --> 10:23.522
You know, they say when
you come you die a little bit.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.190
Is that why you don't
want to come anymore?

10:25.191 --> 10:28.152
You afraid of dying?

10:28.153 --> 10:30.279
Fear of death is, um,

10:30.280 --> 10:32.656
not my issue.

10:32.657 --> 10:36.493
Fear of irrelevancy.

10:36.494 --> 10:39.830
Now, that scares
the shit out of me.

10:39.831 --> 10:42.541
So what is it then?

10:42.542 --> 10:45.210
Why don't you want to
come with me anymore?

10:47.464 --> 10:50.758
You know who Edmund Hillary is?

10:50.759 --> 10:54.261
Are you fucking the guy
who climbed Everest?

10:58.725 --> 11:02.686
He risked everything
to reach the summit.

11:02.687 --> 11:04.521
And when he finally
stood on top of the world,

11:04.522 --> 11:06.106
you know how long it was for?

11:06.107 --> 11:08.901
Mm-mm.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.903
Fifteen minutes.

11:12.822 --> 11:14.865
All that excitement,

11:14.866 --> 11:17.451
anticipation,

11:17.452 --> 11:21.330
blood, tears,
and excruciating pain...

11:22.624 --> 11:26.043
all of it for
a measly 15 minutes.

11:29.839 --> 11:32.424
And on his way down,

11:32.425 --> 11:34.718
he and Tenzing,
his trusty Sherpa,

11:34.719 --> 11:36.678
celebrated with soup.

11:40.391 --> 11:43.185
It's the climb, Cass.

11:51.611 --> 11:54.488
It's all about the climb.

11:54.489 --> 11:56.990
I sure hope the soup was good.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.541
All right, let's hear it
for Cora, everybody.

12:47.542 --> 12:49.334
Huh, isn't she great?

12:49.335 --> 12:51.295
The lovely, sweet,
talented Cora.

12:51.296 --> 12:52.172
Easy!

12:52.173 --> 12:54.006
Very special lady,
that Cora.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.299
What, do you got
a fuckin' train to catch?

12:55.300 --> 12:56.425
I should be counting
my tips right now.

12:56.426 --> 12:58.218
Speaking of tips, uh,

12:58.219 --> 13:00.554
any chance of sliding mine
into your mouth for a second?

13:00.555 --> 13:02.472
No.
You got two minutes.

13:02.473 --> 13:05.142
By the way, a five-dollar
discount on a hand job,

13:05.143 --> 13:06.852
kind of a shitty
going-away present.

13:06.853 --> 13:07.812
All right, everybody.
Time to go.

13:07.813 --> 13:10.147
Closing time.

13:10.148 --> 13:11.356
Your soul-crushing
existences await you.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.775
Fuck you, Jew.

13:13.776 --> 13:17.905
Ah, "Jew."
Such a versatile word.

13:17.906 --> 13:19.031
It's both a people
and an insult.

13:19.032 --> 13:22.326
Tell me, pal, is there
a Mrs. Drunken Shithead at home?

13:22.327 --> 13:24.036
How'd you like
a fucking beating, huh?

13:24.037 --> 13:25.829
Aren't you worried if you, uh,
get blood on your knuckles

13:25.830 --> 13:27.581
your wife will think you're
seeing another woman?

13:27.582 --> 13:28.749
Cocksucker.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.209
"Cocksucker."
Another gem.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.668
Let me guess.
Lit major?

13:31.669 --> 13:33.503
Or is this just a game where...
where you and I

13:33.504 --> 13:35.297
blurt out hobbies you think
your mother and I share?

13:35.298 --> 13:36.174
You're dead, asshole.

13:36.175 --> 13:38.217
I don't think so,
you fucking hard-on.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.093
Hey, Lou, you want to
take care of this guy for me?

13:39.094 --> 13:41.053
- Lou?
- No fucking Lou.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.471
- Lou?
- No Lou.

13:42.472 --> 13:43.431
Fuck me.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.390
I think Z's in trouble.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.266
Would you focus, Carol?

13:46.267 --> 13:47.143
'Cause if I'm being honest,

13:47.144 --> 13:49.269
you're doing kind of
a subpar job here.

13:49.270 --> 13:50.687
Okay, it's like I'm jerking off
left-handed.

13:50.688 --> 13:52.147
Trust me, pal, you don't
want to do this.

13:52.148 --> 13:53.523
- Okay, trust me.
- Yeah, why the fuck not, huh?

13:53.524 --> 13:55.192
Full disclosure,
I'm asthmatic.

13:55.193 --> 13:57.194
- I have asthma.
- Shit, shit, shit.

13:57.195 --> 13:58.528
It's like hitting a guy with
fucking glasses, it's cowardly.

13:58.529 --> 13:59.863
Plus, a fucking guy from Southie

13:59.864 --> 14:01.323
beating up a minority,

14:01.324 --> 14:02.449
it's not a lot of points
for originality.

14:02.450 --> 14:03.034
Yeah?

14:07.538 --> 14:10.791
You're lucky that Carol's got
palms like a fucking teamster.

14:10.792 --> 14:12.250
Come on, we gotta be at Logan
in two hours.

14:14.045 --> 14:16.505
Thank you.
You've been a great crowd.

14:16.506 --> 14:18.548
So, Cass, should we talk about
the elephant in the room?

14:18.549 --> 14:20.050
- Not you, Ralphie.
- Shut the fuck up.

14:20.051 --> 14:21.551
- That being?
- Come on.

14:21.552 --> 14:22.761
It didn't singe your sissy
a little

14:22.762 --> 14:23.804
seeing your ex-boyfriend
get the couch?

14:23.805 --> 14:25.472
Sorry, but I'm not ten.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.224
- Yeah, but you're human.
- Exactly.

14:27.225 --> 14:29.351
Thus I can transcend pettiness

14:29.352 --> 14:30.394
and actually be happy
for someone

14:30.395 --> 14:32.896
without it reflecting back
on me and my career.

14:32.897 --> 14:33.648
Did she just say "thus"?

14:33.649 --> 14:34.690
Did she say "career"?

14:34.691 --> 14:37.567
Fuck you guys.

14:37.568 --> 14:39.027
You're full of shit.
I'm jealous.

14:39.028 --> 14:40.570
I'm practically shitting blood
sitting here

14:40.571 --> 14:41.989
thinking about it,
and you should be too.

14:41.990 --> 14:42.573
Every other comic's success,

14:42.574 --> 14:44.866
every set he kills,

14:44.867 --> 14:46.159
every Merv, Johnny,

14:46.160 --> 14:47.619
or Dinah-fucking-Shore
appearance

14:47.620 --> 14:48.413
another comic makes
is one more

14:48.414 --> 14:49.496
that we didn't get.

14:49.497 --> 14:50.622
Every laugh should feel like

14:50.623 --> 14:52.708
a sharp poke
in your fucking eye.

14:52.709 --> 14:55.877
If it doesn't,
get the fuck out.

14:55.878 --> 14:57.463
'Cause you don't care enough.

15:03.261 --> 15:04.261
There it is.

15:04.262 --> 15:06.263
- You know what?
- Fantastic.

15:06.264 --> 15:09.016
That's a motherfucking
two-thirty in the morning

15:09.017 --> 15:09.726
pancake speech right there.

15:09.727 --> 15:11.059
Fuck you.
And fuck you.

15:11.060 --> 15:13.437
Oh, man, if you
were queer, I would just

15:13.438 --> 15:14.730
suck your dick right now.
So beautiful.

15:14.731 --> 15:16.815
You know what?
I'll do it.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.025
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.
- Let me in there.

15:18.026 --> 15:19.359
- I'm going in.
- Get that dick.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.360
Oh!

15:20.361 --> 15:22.446
Can I just enjoy my
plate of latkes one night

15:22.447 --> 15:24.322
without you two
pretending to blow each other?

15:24.323 --> 15:25.615
- Waitress!
- Get the check!

15:25.616 --> 15:27.451
Check!
Hurry the fuck up, check!

15:27.452 --> 15:28.785
Why you gotta make this ugly?

16:35.686 --> 16:38.230
Call an ambulance.

17:05.715 --> 17:10.303
Do you think I'll ever
play The Main Stage?

17:10.304 --> 17:11.387
Hey, I'm talking to you.

17:11.388 --> 17:14.558
What the fuck, Cass?

17:14.559 --> 17:15.559
Come on.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.144
What?

17:17.145 --> 17:18.811
- I'm just asking.
- Well, you see what I'm doing.

17:18.813 --> 17:20.689
No... but-give me a...
give me a minute, okay?

17:20.690 --> 17:23.191
It's my third time through
the fucking alphabet down there.

17:23.192 --> 17:25.402
I'm a delicate flower, sorry.

17:25.403 --> 17:27.279
That's 20 minutes of my life
I'll never get back.

17:27.280 --> 17:31.741
Yeah, but do you really want
20 minutes of <i>your</i> life back?

17:31.742 --> 17:34.286
Touché.

17:34.287 --> 17:37.038
I need your opinion.

17:38.583 --> 17:39.833
If the question is,
who do you have to blow

17:39.834 --> 17:40.876
to get in the main room,

17:40.877 --> 17:43.253
you're in the wrong fucking car.

17:43.254 --> 17:44.921
I know, it's Goldie.

17:44.922 --> 17:46.590
She keeps telling me
I have to do more

17:46.591 --> 17:47.966
"women appropriate" shit.
What is that?

17:47.967 --> 17:49.676
What, like jokes about
Tupperware

17:49.677 --> 17:51.761
and ring around the collar?

17:51.762 --> 17:53.680
What did you think?

17:53.681 --> 17:55.474
Goldie's just gonna build you
a ramp to The Main Stage?

17:55.475 --> 17:57.184
It's a meritocracy; it's not
a fucking charity event.

17:57.185 --> 17:58.768
Yeah, it's easy for you to say.
You're a guy.

17:58.769 --> 18:00.103
You can say whatever you want.

18:00.104 --> 18:02.189
Goldie doesn't owe you shit,
okay?

18:02.190 --> 18:04.107
You're not in the main room
because you're not ready, and

18:04.108 --> 18:06.026
don't give me that whole "easy
cause you're a guy" cop out.

18:06.027 --> 18:08.570
You're slightly better
than that.

18:10.364 --> 18:11.740
Jesus Christ, you gave me
a heart attack, Ralph.

18:11.741 --> 18:14.493
What's up?

18:14.494 --> 18:16.286
Get out of the car.

18:16.287 --> 18:17.662
What?

18:32.345 --> 18:35.972
A fucking bus.

18:35.973 --> 18:38.391
They act like it's
a goddamn freeway out there.

18:42.813 --> 18:43.314
Sorry.

18:46.234 --> 18:46.817
We should probably do something,

18:46.818 --> 18:49.236
some kind of memorial.

18:50.655 --> 18:52.280
I'm sorry.

18:52.281 --> 18:55.283
I dropped two hits of blotter
around three in the morning.

18:55.284 --> 18:56.284
I'm still a little...

18:56.285 --> 18:58.328
still just a tiny bit fucked up.

18:58.329 --> 18:59.579
This is terrible, though.

18:59.580 --> 19:04.709
Let's go on with our memorial
arrangements for Clay, please.

19:07.171 --> 19:09.506
It's noticeable, isn't it?

19:09.507 --> 19:12.259
I'm picking up Clay's parents at
the airport in a couple hours.

19:12.260 --> 19:13.552
I can ask them if they're open

19:13.553 --> 19:14.719
to having a ceremony
or something.

19:16.931 --> 19:17.765
Oh, fuck.

19:17.766 --> 19:19.099
Jesus!

19:19.100 --> 19:21.184
Wait out-fucking-side,
will you, Ed?

19:21.185 --> 19:22.811
I didn't know Clay was gonna die
when I took the shit, obviously.

19:22.812 --> 19:24.229
Come on.
Come on.

19:24.230 --> 19:26.064
Should be babysitting
my nephews now.

19:26.065 --> 19:28.775
- Come on.
- We watch <i>H. R. Pufnstuf</i>

19:28.776 --> 19:30.527
on Saturdays... you know what
I'm talking about, Sully.

19:30.528 --> 19:31.279
Yeah, man,
acid and babysitting.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.904
It's pretty self-explanatory.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.447
Fuck yeah.

19:34.448 --> 19:36.992
We can all, maybe
say a few words, huh?

19:36.993 --> 19:37.827
I'll call Jerry's.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.495
Get us a platter.

19:40.955 --> 19:42.914
Think I should try to
book a church?

19:42.915 --> 19:46.501
Fuck no.
We're in one.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.384
You know who swam in this pool?

19:54.385 --> 19:56.720
Like, bacteria and shit?

19:56.721 --> 19:58.555
One Mister Burl Ives.

20:01.726 --> 20:03.935
So you still didn't
answer my question, Carl.

20:03.936 --> 20:04.978
What did Goldie say?

20:04.979 --> 20:07.314
She said yes.

20:07.315 --> 20:09.566
Well, good, shit, finally!

20:09.567 --> 20:11.693
In the near future.

20:11.694 --> 20:13.570
Oh.

20:13.571 --> 20:14.821
Well, how fucking near?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.781
Soon.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.908
I don't know.

20:18.909 --> 20:21.202
Another six months?

20:21.203 --> 20:23.163
She says you're not ready.

20:23.164 --> 20:25.999
Look, I've been doing open mic
for over a fucking year now.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.751
Okay, I want fucking Carson,
Carl.

20:27.752 --> 20:28.918
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you and every other

20:28.919 --> 20:30.670
pencil dick with five minutes.

20:30.671 --> 20:31.921
Listen, it's a marathon, kid,

20:31.922 --> 20:33.089
I keep telling you.

20:33.090 --> 20:34.591
You keep telling me
a lot of shit.

20:34.592 --> 20:36.593
Okay, you're my manager.
Fucking manage me.

20:36.594 --> 20:37.261
And if you can't
get me the big room,

20:37.262 --> 20:39.596
at least get me a paid gig.

20:39.597 --> 20:41.473
What pay?
Goldie doesn't pay anybody.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.849
It's a showcase.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.768
What about that gig
at the church?

20:44.769 --> 20:46.311
Babysitting immigrant kids

20:46.312 --> 20:47.896
is not a gig, Carl.

20:47.897 --> 20:49.397
Okay, I need real money.

20:49.398 --> 20:50.107
All right, I want to get
my own pad,

20:50.108 --> 20:52.776
a place where I can
take girls

20:52.777 --> 20:54.611
without you wandering through
in your boxers,

20:54.612 --> 20:56.279
eating baked beans
out of a pan.

20:56.280 --> 20:57.656
It'll come.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.782
It will come.

20:58.783 --> 21:00.325
In the meantime,

21:00.326 --> 21:01.285
just keep entertaining
the little beige tots

21:01.286 --> 21:03.828
while you hone your craft
at Goldie's

21:03.829 --> 21:04.996
until it's time.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.039
And... and when exactly
is... is that?

21:06.040 --> 21:08.458
Goldie will let you know,

21:08.459 --> 21:10.043
in the same way she let Prinze

21:10.044 --> 21:12.003
and Walker and Appuzzo know.

21:25.476 --> 21:27.977
God willing,

21:27.978 --> 21:30.980
some day this will all be ashes.

21:30.981 --> 21:33.984
Their poor mothers.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.201
You know they hate you, right?

21:58.592 --> 22:02.804
Hey, uh, is there any chance
of us passing by Grauman's?

22:02.805 --> 22:03.514
Tourists?

22:03.515 --> 22:05.598
Uh, comics.
From Boston.

22:08.227 --> 22:09.019
What?

22:09.020 --> 22:10.854
Nothing.

22:10.855 --> 22:12.856
Come on,
let us in on the joke.

22:12.857 --> 22:13.982
At the risk of
blowing my dime tip,

22:13.983 --> 22:16.568
I'll tell you.

22:16.569 --> 22:19.821
Ever since Carson moved his
outfit from New York to here,

22:19.822 --> 22:21.364
every asshole who think
he can tell a joke

22:21.365 --> 22:23.950
has been circling Burbank
like a fucking vulture.

22:23.951 --> 22:26.870
Nice to meet you too.

22:26.871 --> 22:28.371
- You asked.
- I did.

22:31.709 --> 22:32.501
All right, oh.

22:34.962 --> 22:38.381
You religious, Adam?

22:38.382 --> 22:40.216
No,
I figured I'd find Jesus

22:40.217 --> 22:42.552
after I'm pulled over
by some white cops in Bel Air.

22:44.138 --> 22:45.805
A conversion based on fear
isn't a conversion.

22:45.806 --> 22:48.641
It's insurance.

22:48.642 --> 22:50.393
That's nice, Father.

22:50.394 --> 22:52.437
If the Catholic Church
starts making fortune cookies,

22:52.438 --> 22:54.981
I think you the man.

22:54.982 --> 22:57.525
So you talk to
the powers that be

22:57.526 --> 22:59.152
about my raise?

22:59.153 --> 23:00.029
Sorry.

23:00.030 --> 23:01.529
It pays what it pays.

23:01.530 --> 23:03.448
Ah, are you sure
there's nothing that I can do

23:03.449 --> 23:05.450
to make 'em throw
a little extra bread my way?

23:05.451 --> 23:08.454
Carl's cool, but I'm starting
to get desperate.

23:13.542 --> 23:17.170
There are other ways
of supplementing income.

23:17.171 --> 23:20.381
Here at the church, I mean.

23:20.382 --> 23:22.842
What's the figure?

23:22.843 --> 23:24.636
Two hundred.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.054
Dollars?

23:26.055 --> 23:28.139
It pays a lot, Adam,

23:28.140 --> 23:30.559
because it costs a lot.

23:54.917 --> 23:56.459
Hello.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.002
Uh...

23:58.003 --> 23:59.295
Is, uh, Clay here?

23:59.296 --> 24:00.005
Who are you?

24:02.132 --> 24:03.800
We're, uh,

24:03.801 --> 24:04.552
we're friends of his
from Boston.

24:04.553 --> 24:07.345
We, uh,
he said we had a...

24:07.346 --> 24:10.473
we got a place to crash
if we came to town, so...

24:10.474 --> 24:11.850
here we are.

24:11.851 --> 24:12.309
Ta-da.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.311
Hi, I'm, uh, Eddie.

24:15.312 --> 24:17.313
Eddie Zeidel.
Nice to meet you.

24:17.314 --> 24:19.399
This is my friend, Ron Shack.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.067
Hey.
Very nice to meet you.

24:21.068 --> 24:23.570
I'm sorry, Clay's dead.

24:26.323 --> 24:27.699
Excuse me?

24:27.700 --> 24:30.952
Um, last night there was
an accident on Sunset.

24:30.953 --> 24:33.705
Wait.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.331
W...

24:35.332 --> 24:36.499
He...

24:36.500 --> 24:38.376
He was on Carson,
I mean, we...

24:38.377 --> 24:39.336
we talked.

24:39.336 --> 24:39.837
Yeah, he got the fucking couch.

24:39.838 --> 24:41.963
I'm sorry.

24:41.964 --> 24:44.215
Wait... wait, hold on, hold on.
Um...

24:44.216 --> 24:46.134
Look, we just kind of

24:46.135 --> 24:47.385
come a really long way.

24:47.386 --> 24:49.095
Uh, so is... is this like
a brush-off

24:49.096 --> 24:50.263
or... or a joke or...

24:50.264 --> 24:52.932
Yeah, fucking hilarious,
isn't it?

24:52.933 --> 24:54.602
I think it's best you boys
made other arrangements.

24:58.522 --> 25:01.316
Come on, Kay.

25:02.860 --> 25:05.320
Of course Clay loved you.

25:05.321 --> 25:07.447
It was two months.

25:07.448 --> 25:11.117
Hardly a romance for the ages.

25:11.118 --> 25:12.201
Who wouldn't be crazy about you?

25:12.202 --> 25:13.703
You're pretty,
you're kind,

25:13.704 --> 25:15.038
and you never mess up
my drink order.

25:16.290 --> 25:18.207
- Vodka and tonic.
- Yep.

25:18.208 --> 25:19.959
Those acting classes
are paying off.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.210
Mm.

25:24.256 --> 25:27.383
- What is that like?
- Well...

25:27.384 --> 25:29.844
it, uh, doesn't burn
if that's what you're asking.

25:29.845 --> 25:30.970
I'm serious.

25:30.971 --> 25:33.264
It's like here.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.934
Some nights you kill.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.728
Some nights you bomb.

25:38.729 --> 25:41.814
For some fucked-up reason
you...

25:41.815 --> 25:44.901
keep coming back.

25:47.071 --> 25:48.947
We're gonna fuck, aren't we?

25:48.948 --> 25:52.200
Are we?

25:52.201 --> 25:54.077
Change of clothes.
Half a pack of cigarettes.

25:54.078 --> 25:56.788
A postcard.

26:13.055 --> 26:15.139
What kind of god
does something like that?

26:15.140 --> 26:16.265
You work your ass off;

26:16.266 --> 26:17.392
you kill on <i>The Tonight Show;</i>

26:17.393 --> 26:18.726
you get the fucking couch;

26:18.727 --> 26:20.853
that very night,
you're hit by a bus?

26:20.854 --> 26:21.814
You're buddy got hit
crossing against a green.

26:21.815 --> 26:25.441
That's not God,
that's Darwin or Budweiser.

26:25.442 --> 26:27.443
Well, you're a real cunt
sometimes.

26:27.444 --> 26:31.698
Hey, I find the word
"sometimes" offensive.

26:31.699 --> 26:33.116
Excuse me?

26:33.117 --> 26:34.951
Who do we talk to
about stage time?

26:34.952 --> 26:36.953
Uh, amateur night's
Tuesday night, guys.

26:36.954 --> 26:37.621
Sign-up sheet's
by the register.

26:37.622 --> 26:39.497
No, no, no, no, no, uh...

26:39.498 --> 26:41.374
We... we don't do open mic.
We're pros.

26:41.375 --> 26:43.418
Oh, wow!
Oh, wow.

26:43.419 --> 26:44.336
Oh, I got, uh, Richard Pryor's

26:44.337 --> 26:46.546
going on Thursday night.

26:46.547 --> 26:47.464
I can, uh, bump him
if it means

26:47.465 --> 26:50.800
that I can get some pros
on stage.

26:50.801 --> 26:52.969
Look, he didn't mean anything,
okay?

26:52.970 --> 26:54.971
We're working comics
from Boston

26:54.972 --> 26:56.472
and we came out
to stay with a friend

26:56.473 --> 26:58.766
and he was gonna
set us up out here,

26:58.767 --> 27:00.184
but unfortunately, he...

27:00.185 --> 27:02.061
he died last night, so...

27:02.062 --> 27:05.064
Clay.

27:05.065 --> 27:06.441
Clay Appuzzo, yeah.

27:06.442 --> 27:08.317
Anyway, we got nowhere to crash,

27:08.318 --> 27:09.944
and we spent everything
just to get out here.

27:09.945 --> 27:13.781
So if you could help us out
and give us some stage time?

27:13.782 --> 27:15.616
What, are you guys
like a Rowan and Martin?

27:15.617 --> 27:17.410
No, separate acts.

27:17.411 --> 27:18.870
Well,

27:18.871 --> 27:21.330
amateur night's the best
I can do for you guys.

27:21.331 --> 27:23.416
Can't play the main room
without Goldie's blessing

27:23.417 --> 27:26.544
and even open mics
are like a three-week wait.

27:26.545 --> 27:28.963
Fuck, fucking suck a duck.

27:28.964 --> 27:29.590
Fuck duck!

27:29.591 --> 27:33.259
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

27:33.260 --> 27:34.303
Fuck!

27:37.139 --> 27:38.515
He retarded?

27:40.184 --> 27:42.560
Listen, man, um,

27:42.561 --> 27:44.520
if...

27:44.521 --> 27:46.814
if there's anything
you could do to help us out?

27:46.815 --> 27:49.150
Well, if you guys
need a place to stay

27:49.151 --> 27:50.526
until you make it big,

27:50.527 --> 27:53.447
I can set you up
with something.

27:54.948 --> 27:56.491
Hey, Dory, you think
you could get that ketchup

27:56.492 --> 27:58.451
that I asked for
a long time ago, you know,

27:58.452 --> 28:01.078
before your Social Security
kicks in?

28:01.079 --> 28:04.123
The nicest.
The nicest.

28:11.548 --> 28:14.050
"Fa Napoli."

28:14.051 --> 28:15.259
Next time just mail it.

28:15.260 --> 28:16.677
It's a postcard,
not a telegram.

28:16.678 --> 28:18.680
I think it's a suicide note
from Clay.

28:23.060 --> 28:23.977
How is this a suicide note?

28:23.978 --> 28:27.438
It's part of a Goethe quote.
"Fa Napoli."

28:27.439 --> 28:29.315
"See Naples and die."

28:29.316 --> 28:30.566
Clay used to say it
all the time.

28:30.567 --> 28:31.818
It meant once you see Naples,

28:31.819 --> 28:33.569
there was nothing left to do
but die

28:33.570 --> 28:38.074
because nothing would ever
compare to that moment.

28:38.075 --> 28:39.283
It's a postcard, Cass.

28:39.284 --> 28:42.578
That he left on the bedside
table at the Sunset Tower Hotel.

28:42.579 --> 28:44.038
Why was he even staying
at a hotel

28:44.039 --> 28:45.289
when he lives two blocks away?

28:45.290 --> 28:46.707
I don't know.

28:46.708 --> 28:47.626
Look, you want to play
<i>Mod Squad,</i> fine,

28:47.627 --> 28:50.086
but pull this shit
with someone else.

28:50.087 --> 28:51.587
Pull what shit?

28:51.588 --> 28:53.923
The shit where you build
a fucking shrine to a guy

28:53.924 --> 28:55.925
who wiped his feet on your ass
for two years.

28:55.926 --> 28:56.385
I came here as a friend.

28:56.386 --> 28:57.510
I understand.

28:57.511 --> 28:59.804
Clay died.
It's a fucking tragedy.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.097
I get it.

29:01.098 --> 29:01.765
It's this fond revisionist
bullshit

29:01.766 --> 29:03.724
that makes me want to puke.

29:03.725 --> 29:05.893
It'd make Clay puke too.
And you know what?

29:05.894 --> 29:07.061
You just want to sit there and
sweep all his dick-ish qualities

29:07.062 --> 29:09.564
under the rug and... and magically
turn the silent asshole

29:09.565 --> 29:11.649
at the end of his name into a

29:11.650 --> 29:13.067
"There'll never be
another like him,"

29:13.068 --> 29:14.443
then go for it,
but you're gonna have to

29:14.444 --> 29:16.153
rewrite history
with some other shithead.

29:16.154 --> 29:16.697
Go fuck yourself, Bill.

29:16.698 --> 29:19.115
He dumped you, Cass.

29:19.116 --> 29:21.784
I'm right here.
I'm right fucking here!

29:21.785 --> 29:22.869
He makes a good point.

29:29.459 --> 29:31.460
That is fucking bullshit, Mitch.

29:32.422 --> 29:33.838
Johnny liked your boy.

29:33.839 --> 29:35.381
- Gave him the fucking couch.
- Yeah.

29:35.382 --> 29:37.216
Now this thing with the bus?

29:37.217 --> 29:39.552
Drugs, possibly?

29:39.553 --> 29:41.721
So rumors are
the rule of the day now?

29:41.722 --> 29:44.265
He went out to celebrate,
got a little drunk,

29:44.266 --> 29:45.725
fell in front of a bus.

29:45.726 --> 29:47.768
It... Carson gave him the couch.

29:47.769 --> 29:49.353
Who wouldn't tie one on?

29:49.354 --> 29:50.147
People there say
he saw the bus,

29:50.148 --> 29:51.689
walked right out
in front of it.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.274
Police are still investigating.

29:53.275 --> 29:55.151
Wha... so Johnny's fucking
punishing me now?

29:55.152 --> 29:56.069
It's the fucking sponsors.

29:56.070 --> 29:57.862
If anyone's being punished,
it's us.

29:57.863 --> 29:59.697
Okay, look,
Johnny feels bad.

29:59.698 --> 30:01.324
But I just think
we need to book some

30:01.325 --> 30:02.700
more established comics
for a little while,

30:02.701 --> 30:03.160
see how it all shakes out.

30:03.161 --> 30:05.369
"Established"?

30:05.370 --> 30:06.954
What are you gonna
dry-clean Red Skeleton,

30:06.955 --> 30:08.998
send him out there?
Good fucking luck!

30:08.999 --> 30:10.541
How long we talking?

30:10.542 --> 30:11.709
We're thinking
four, five months.

30:11.710 --> 30:12.960
Then I'll bring the kids
right back in.

30:12.961 --> 30:15.171
You want retreads?
Be my guest.

30:15.172 --> 30:16.006
Merv, <i>Midnight Special,</i>

30:16.007 --> 30:18.341
they can have first shot
at my kids.

30:18.342 --> 30:21.302
I got agents and producers
packing this place

30:21.303 --> 30:23.846
every night,
because if you're waiting

30:23.847 --> 30:25.389
for them to act stable,

30:25.390 --> 30:28.059
you got a <i>long</i> fuckin' wait.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.686
I mean, they got mommy issues;
they got daddy issues;

30:30.687 --> 30:33.940
they're about as stable
as a Middle East cease-fire.

30:33.941 --> 30:36.776
That volatility,
that pain,

30:36.777 --> 30:40.196
that willingness to walk out
in front of a bus

30:40.197 --> 30:42.531
an hour after killing it
on Johnny Carson...

30:42.532 --> 30:45.242
- if that's what he did...
- That's exactly what he...

30:45.243 --> 30:47.995
Well, that's the price
of fucking brilliance, isn't it?

30:47.996 --> 30:51.207
That's what makes
millions of your viewers

30:51.208 --> 30:52.500
stay up till
the ass crack of dawn,

30:52.501 --> 30:55.336
waiting to see them.

30:55.337 --> 30:59.131
These are tortured
fucking souls, Mitch.

30:59.132 --> 31:00.216
I j...

31:00.217 --> 31:02.551
And here I thought we were
talking about comics.

31:03.553 --> 31:04.720
You want genius?

31:04.721 --> 31:05.597
You come here.

31:05.598 --> 31:07.473
You want Catskill

31:07.474 --> 31:10.226
or some green kid
shitting walnuts

31:10.227 --> 31:11.560
on national television,
<i>zay gezunt.</i>

31:11.561 --> 31:13.813
Goldie, the kingmaker.

31:13.814 --> 31:15.147
Damn straight.

31:15.148 --> 31:16.108
And you know what
they get from me,

31:16.109 --> 31:20.236
these kids, they don't
get anywhere else?

31:20.237 --> 31:21.737
These babies, huh?

31:21.738 --> 31:22.780
Oh...

31:22.781 --> 31:25.074
I nurse these fuckin' kids.

31:25.075 --> 31:26.951
They latch on
and don't let go

31:26.952 --> 31:29.120
till I tell them when.

31:29.121 --> 31:32.039
So, when they go on your show,

31:32.040 --> 31:34.125
they knock it
out of the fucking park!

31:34.126 --> 31:34.751
Huh?

31:34.752 --> 31:36.919
It's called trust, Mitch.

31:36.920 --> 31:40.548
They trust that
when I know they're ready,

31:40.549 --> 31:43.217
that's when they're ready.

31:43.218 --> 31:45.261
And that's when
I call you fuck-tards.

31:45.262 --> 31:47.096
Okay, look, we both know
those other shows

31:47.097 --> 31:48.639
don't mean shit to these kids.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.890
It's Johnny or nothing.

31:49.891 --> 31:51.434
So why don't we just
let the sponsors

31:51.435 --> 31:53.602
have a little time
to let their pants dry

31:53.603 --> 31:55.604
and then I'll see what I can do.

31:55.605 --> 31:56.981
Yeah, we can all hold hands

31:56.982 --> 31:58.774
and buy the world
a fucking Coke, too.

32:00.027 --> 32:00.736
Not for nothing,
nice tits.

32:00.737 --> 32:04.155
Fuckin' took you long enough.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.656
So...

32:05.657 --> 32:08.534
What do you think
of the place?

32:08.535 --> 32:10.828
I think we're standing in the
middle of a fucking closet.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.580
I mean, you can't put a bed
in here, much less two.

32:12.581 --> 32:14.290
Yeah, but you can fit
two sleeping bags right here,

32:14.291 --> 32:16.500
plus you got access
to a full kitchen, shower,

32:16.501 --> 32:18.837
toilet, all semi-functional.

32:20.088 --> 32:21.798
We'll take it.

32:24.301 --> 32:26.802
Are you fuckin' serious?

32:26.803 --> 32:27.929
We need a place to crash.

32:29.931 --> 32:31.515
All right.

32:31.516 --> 32:34.060
Need the rent up front.
Sixty bucks cash.

32:34.061 --> 32:35.853
I'm not gonna, uh,
I'm not gonna...

32:35.854 --> 32:37.605
What do you got?
Just say it.

32:37.606 --> 32:39.649
- I got... I got 11... 11 bucks.
- Just say what you have.

32:40.567 --> 32:41.859
Just give me the ten.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.487
- You sure?
- Yeah.

32:44.488 --> 32:46.030
All right.
Rules.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.823
You live with
three other people now, okay?

32:47.824 --> 32:49.075
So you got to put your name
on your food.

32:49.076 --> 32:50.076
If you don't have
your name on your food,

32:50.077 --> 32:51.202
then it's up for grabs.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.912
- Okay.
- Labels.

32:52.913 --> 32:54.497
Also, don't touch my snake,
and don't think

32:54.498 --> 32:56.415
you're doing me any favors
by feeding him, okay?

32:56.416 --> 32:57.583
Where... where's the snake?
The snake's in here?

32:57.584 --> 33:00.044
And listen, this is the
closet to my room, out here, so

33:00.045 --> 33:01.921
- if I'm in there with Maggie...
- Who's Maggie?

33:01.922 --> 33:04.006
She's my girl.
By the way, hands off, okay?

33:04.007 --> 33:07.134
If I'm out here with Maggie,
screwing,

33:07.135 --> 33:08.803
you gotta wait
till we're done.

33:08.804 --> 33:11.263
And what exactly does
that cocktail of degradation

33:11.264 --> 33:12.765
and self-loathing sound like
when it's finished?

33:12.766 --> 33:16.477
Sobbing? A single gunshot?

33:16.478 --> 33:18.104
Probably just a groggy
"where am I?"

33:18.105 --> 33:18.602
after the ether wears off.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.899
God, do you guys just

33:21.900 --> 33:23.567
come up with this
out of the thin air?

33:23.568 --> 33:24.610
It's amazing.

33:24.611 --> 33:27.822
Enjoy your closet.

33:27.823 --> 33:29.658
- Oh.
- Fuck me.

33:31.701 --> 33:34.078
Is that a fucking cat box?

33:34.079 --> 33:35.038
Yeah.

34:04.276 --> 34:06.068
Well, uh...

34:06.069 --> 34:08.529
guess I should just...

34:08.530 --> 34:10.406
uh, all right.

34:10.407 --> 34:12.409
Everybody stand back.

34:20.125 --> 34:23.585
Okay, well, you gotta
take that down.

34:23.587 --> 34:24.712
I'm fuckin' serious.

34:24.713 --> 34:25.795
Language, Adam, please.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.216
"Language"?
Really?

34:34.848 --> 34:39.101
So anybody here from...
from out of town?

34:42.147 --> 34:43.772
Are you having a good time,
ma'am?

34:43.773 --> 34:45.774
Really?
All right, tell your face.

34:47.068 --> 34:48.902
I am Mexican.
That's right.

34:48.904 --> 34:52.406
I look like, uh,
Tony Orlando

34:52.407 --> 34:53.616
had a baby

34:53.617 --> 34:54.909
with Tony Orlando.

34:56.411 --> 34:57.453
What is it about Mexicans...

34:57.454 --> 35:00.498
eh... I wish this didn't happen,
but it's true.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.333
Mexican, right,

35:02.334 --> 35:04.251
is a dirty word still.

35:04.252 --> 35:06.879
You say "Mexican" before
anything, it sounds bad.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.965
Like, for example, uh,
I got some reefer.

35:09.966 --> 35:12.635
Got some Mexican reefer.

35:12.636 --> 35:14.220
No, thank you.

35:14.221 --> 35:16.472
Took my kids to the circus,

35:16.473 --> 35:17.932
the Mexican circus.

35:18.934 --> 35:21.268
What the fuck was that about?

35:21.269 --> 35:22.895
Took him to see a clown,

35:22.896 --> 35:25.439
the Mexican clown.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.774
Hey, kids, look,
it's <i>Puto</i> the Clown.

35:28.568 --> 35:29.818
I gotta take a piss.

35:29.819 --> 35:31.695
Want me to make a
balloon animal with my wiener?

35:31.696 --> 35:33.155
Hey, hey.

35:33.156 --> 35:34.490
I gotta talk to Goldie
about Clay's memorial.

35:34.491 --> 35:35.658
Look, I fucked up, okay?

35:35.659 --> 35:38.410
I'm an antisocial asshole,
a narcissistic douche bag.

35:38.411 --> 35:41.455
Let me know when
you get to an apology.

35:41.456 --> 35:43.832
Hey.

35:43.833 --> 35:46.502
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

35:46.503 --> 35:47.170
Oh, hey, Clay's friend.

35:47.171 --> 35:50.089
- Yeah, Eddie.
- Cassie.

35:50.090 --> 35:52.841
Look, I-I just... I wanted
to apologize for earlier.

35:52.842 --> 35:54.009
No, I'm sorry about that...

35:54.010 --> 35:55.344
No, no-no-no-no,
please, don't.

35:55.345 --> 35:56.345
I mean, a couple of bums
show up,

35:56.346 --> 35:58.597
trying to crash
on your boyfriend's couch...

35:58.598 --> 36:00.099
No, he wasn't my boyfriend.

36:00.100 --> 36:01.350
He was my boyfriend.

36:01.351 --> 36:02.143
We were together for two years,

36:02.144 --> 36:04.687
but it's been over for a while.

36:04.688 --> 36:06.605
- And...
- Oh.

36:06.606 --> 36:08.691
I'm just trying to take care
of his parents and get...

36:08.692 --> 36:12.945
No, that sounds...
that sounds really nice of you.

36:12.946 --> 36:14.196
We found a place.

36:14.197 --> 36:15.156
Oh, good.

36:15.156 --> 36:15.865
Yeah, yeah.
Arnie's.

36:15.866 --> 36:17.950
Oh, that's not good.

36:17.951 --> 36:19.034
It's great, actually,
it's, uh,

36:19.035 --> 36:21.745
it's a closet,
is what it is.

36:21.746 --> 36:23.747
It's got a wonderful view,
though.

36:23.748 --> 36:25.374
Looks on to some kind of
performance space

36:25.375 --> 36:27.668
where, uh, bums take craps
in between parked cars.

36:27.669 --> 36:28.503
Yeah.

36:28.504 --> 36:30.129
I don't want to oversell
it for you,

36:30.130 --> 36:31.547
but what it lacks in dignity
it makes up for

36:31.548 --> 36:32.673
in horrifying spectacle.

36:32.674 --> 36:34.216
Okay.

36:34.217 --> 36:35.010
This guy's doing fucking
dick jokes over here,

36:35.011 --> 36:36.969
I'm trying,
I'm trying my best.

36:36.970 --> 36:39.263
Oh, thank you
for making me laugh.

36:39.264 --> 36:40.889
- All right.
- I'll talk to you later.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.349
- Yeah, I'll see you.
- Okay, take care.

36:42.350 --> 36:44.560
Hey, is Kay here?

36:44.561 --> 36:45.437
Is Kay here?
Kay, Kay the waitress.

36:45.438 --> 36:47.646
- Clay's Kay?
- How the fuck do I know?

36:48.815 --> 36:50.065
She gave me crabs.

36:50.066 --> 36:51.191
Aw, what'd you get her?

36:51.192 --> 36:51.901
I'm fucking serious, man.

36:51.902 --> 36:53.944
Just go get some Quell...

36:53.945 --> 36:55.571
I slept with Betty last night.

36:55.572 --> 36:56.864
It's nice knowing you.

36:56.865 --> 36:58.824
Yeah, and she's already hormonal
'cause she's six-months pregnant

36:58.825 --> 37:00.409
so great, she's gonna
kill me now

37:00.410 --> 37:03.579
because I fucking turned her
panties into a fucking aquarium.

37:03.580 --> 37:05.706
You shown it to anyone else?

37:05.707 --> 37:07.833
Bill.

37:07.834 --> 37:08.876
Anyone who cares?
His parents?

37:08.877 --> 37:10.794
No, but I'm going to.

37:10.795 --> 37:12.171
They deserve the truth.

37:12.172 --> 37:16.216
No one deserves the truth,
sweetie.

37:16.217 --> 37:17.885
It's not a reward.

37:17.886 --> 37:20.764
You wouldn't want to know
if it was your son?

37:25.143 --> 37:27.186
My grandmother gave me this

37:27.187 --> 37:30.606
on my 21st birthday.

37:30.607 --> 37:33.901
Talk about your
"to be's or not to be's."

37:33.902 --> 37:36.612
Poor fucker.

37:36.613 --> 37:38.739
Treblinka.

37:38.740 --> 37:41.784
Eight months
before she was liberated.

37:41.785 --> 37:43.327
She said there was
a Star of David

37:43.328 --> 37:46.205
hung above the entrance
to the gas chamber.

37:46.206 --> 37:48.957
Written, in Hebrew,
on a purple curtain

37:48.958 --> 37:51.168
were the words,
"This is the gateway to God.

37:51.169 --> 37:52.503
Righteous men
will pass through."

37:52.504 --> 37:56.799
They even lined the gas chamber
entrance with flowers.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.550
The train ramp
to Treblinka

37:58.551 --> 38:01.220
was disguised to look like
a regular railway station

38:01.221 --> 38:04.223
with timetables, signs,
even a clock

38:04.224 --> 38:06.767
painted on the wall.

38:06.768 --> 38:10.270
What does this
have to do with Clay?

38:10.271 --> 38:13.816
My grandmother knew the truth.

38:13.817 --> 38:16.652
She knew where she was going.

38:16.653 --> 38:19.363
And when she got there,
where she was,

38:19.364 --> 38:23.325
what that acrid smell
in the air was.

38:23.326 --> 38:28.497
But the truth wasn't
gonna let her sleep at night.

38:28.498 --> 38:30.165
It seldom does.

38:30.166 --> 38:32.459
His parents should know.

38:34.671 --> 38:35.796
Say you're right.

38:35.797 --> 38:37.297
They're Catholic.

38:37.298 --> 38:39.508
So you're pretty much
damning their son to Hell.

38:39.509 --> 38:42.136
You tell them the truth,
and they will never have

38:42.137 --> 38:45.432
another decent night's
sleep again.

38:49.519 --> 38:51.895
So what, so I...

38:51.896 --> 38:53.857
so I just shouldn't
say anything?

38:57.193 --> 39:01.363
The flowers at Treblinka?

39:01.364 --> 39:05.868
Bubbe said they were the most
beautiful she'd ever seen.

39:13.418 --> 39:14.710
Guy?

39:14.711 --> 39:16.879
Guy.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.338
I'm so itchy.

39:18.339 --> 39:19.882
What is it?

39:19.883 --> 39:21.800
I don't know.
Is there something on me?

39:24.929 --> 39:27.723
I'm so sorry.

39:27.724 --> 39:29.349
For what?

39:29.350 --> 39:31.351
My dead son's accident

39:31.352 --> 39:33.521
or his giving his mother crabs?

39:37.233 --> 39:39.319
Mister Appuzzo.

39:42.113 --> 39:45.408
Clay left this at the hotel
the night of his accident.

39:49.329 --> 39:53.207
"Napoli."
See Naples.

39:53.208 --> 39:54.875
Why are you showing me this?

39:56.795 --> 39:59.297
I think that Clay might have...

40:02.091 --> 40:03.801
No.

40:06.054 --> 40:09.014
It was an accident.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.265
He was drinking.
He had an accident.

40:10.266 --> 40:12.309
You understand?
He had an accident.

40:12.310 --> 40:14.186
- No, Mister...
- He was drinking and...

40:14.187 --> 40:15.229
He left this at the hotel.

40:15.230 --> 40:17.731
he fell in front of a bus

40:17.732 --> 40:20.818
in this God forsaken
hell hole.

40:20.819 --> 40:22.653
Here, here.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.780
Here's your memorial.
Here's your ashes.

40:27.075 --> 40:28.784
Scatter them all over this...

40:28.785 --> 40:30.494
Gomorrah that killed him!

40:48.638 --> 40:50.514
Good morning, roomie.

40:50.515 --> 40:52.891
Morning.

40:52.892 --> 40:54.309
Do you like bacon?

40:54.310 --> 40:56.937
Or are you
the other kind of Jew?

40:56.938 --> 40:58.565
Uh...

40:59.023 --> 41:00.148
Morning, buddy.

41:00.149 --> 41:02.359
Hey, Mags,
any more bacon?

41:02.360 --> 41:03.069
Yeah,
there's one here.

41:03.070 --> 41:05.488
Thank you.

41:06.739 --> 41:08.198
It's a memorial service.

41:08.199 --> 41:09.658
Nobody's gonna say boo.

41:09.659 --> 41:11.034
Man, Arnie's not even
gonna

41:11.035 --> 41:12.536
let me in the building
without you.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.288
That guy's got his head
so far up Goldie's ass

41:14.289 --> 41:15.914
he can taste her last meal.

41:15.915 --> 41:16.875
Look, I'm being serious, Carl.

41:16.876 --> 41:19.585
My hands are tied.
Charlie's got the brunch.

41:19.586 --> 41:20.961
Lookit, if you say the words

41:20.962 --> 41:23.130
"Charlie" or "Callas"
one more time,

41:23.131 --> 41:25.465
I swear to Christ that I'm going
to take this five-dollar tie

41:25.466 --> 41:27.217
that you so generously
let me borrow

41:27.218 --> 41:28.677
and I'ma hang your ass
with it.

41:28.678 --> 41:30.345
Oh, you want Carson?
Go get Carson.

41:30.346 --> 41:32.723
You got to get in there
with the big boys.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.016
Let 'em see you.

41:34.017 --> 41:35.475
This business is
all about relationships.

41:35.476 --> 41:37.352
You got... you gotta mingle
for Chrissake.

41:37.353 --> 41:39.021
Mingle at a memorial service?

41:39.022 --> 41:41.356
Hey, I got my first break
on <i>The Colgate Comedy Hour</i>

41:41.357 --> 41:43.692
by chatting up Eddie Cantor
at a urinal.

41:43.693 --> 41:44.985
You do what you gotta do.

41:44.986 --> 41:46.111
Wow, you are, like,

41:46.112 --> 41:48.488
the worst fucking manager ever,
you know that, right?

41:48.489 --> 41:50.157
Maybe.
But I believe in you.

41:50.158 --> 41:51.408
And you know that.

41:51.409 --> 41:53.243
We got pork chops tonight.

41:53.244 --> 41:55.829
If you're late and they're dry,
don't blame me.

42:13.890 --> 42:17.684
Guy, please?

42:32.742 --> 42:33.618
Uh, 'scuse me, brother.

42:33.619 --> 42:36.244
Think The Jackson 5's
at The Rainbow.

42:36.245 --> 42:38.538
Hey, Arnie, I'm just
here to pay my respects.

42:38.539 --> 42:40.499
Oh, yeah?
Really?

42:40.500 --> 42:41.125
You were friends with Clay?

42:41.126 --> 42:42.751
Yeah, he... he, uh,

42:42.752 --> 42:45.629
bought me a slice of pizza
after one of my sets.

42:45.630 --> 42:46.464
Oh, so you got
the pizza connection?

42:46.465 --> 42:49.716
Wow, congrats.
That's really cool.

42:49.717 --> 42:50.884
Screw, kid.

42:50.885 --> 42:52.302
Oh, my God!
There you are.

42:52.303 --> 42:54.262
- You look fabulous.
- How do I look?

42:54.263 --> 42:56.264
This kid doesn't know Clay.
He's just here hustling.

42:56.265 --> 42:57.349
Neither do you if you think
Clay would give a shit.

42:57.350 --> 43:01.895
He's my guest.
Come on.

43:01.896 --> 43:05.482
You look like Flip Wilson
went to Sears.

43:05.483 --> 43:07.275
- Hey, thanks, man.
- Man, forget it.

43:07.276 --> 43:08.944
There's only one rule
in this business, and so far

43:08.945 --> 43:09.779
nobody's figured out
what it is yet.

43:09.780 --> 43:12.406
Welcome
to the wild, wild west.

43:12.407 --> 43:13.116
Hey, enjoy the egg salad.

43:16.577 --> 43:18.245
- Hey, hey.
- Smart, college educated.

43:18.246 --> 43:19.955
- Hey.
- Hi.

43:19.956 --> 43:20.623
Uh, where's Betty?
I heard she's bringing seafood.

43:20.624 --> 43:23.500
Shut the fuck up.

43:23.501 --> 43:25.043
She's meeting her mother
to pick out a new crib.

43:25.044 --> 43:26.128
She's gonna come by
a little later, thank you.

43:26.129 --> 43:28.422
What about all the little
piranhas in her panties?

43:28.423 --> 43:29.756
I, uh, told her
I got them at the Y.

43:29.757 --> 43:31.091
Mm.

43:31.092 --> 43:32.010
Well, I mean,
technically, you did.

43:32.011 --> 43:34.177
Man,
you should have heard me.

43:34.178 --> 43:35.637
I'm blasting them
on the phone this morning.

43:35.638 --> 43:37.389
I'm like, "You guys,
my wife is pregnant;

43:37.390 --> 43:39.057
and she probably has them;
and I'm gonna take

43:39.058 --> 43:41.309
the Young Man's Christian
Association to court!"

43:41.310 --> 43:42.978
I used the full name
to intimidate them.

43:42.979 --> 43:43.813
It really worked well.

43:43.814 --> 43:44.980
And she bought all that?

43:44.981 --> 43:45.857
Yeah.
Hook, line, and sinker.

43:45.858 --> 43:47.983
- Ugh.
- I even canceled my membership,

43:47.984 --> 43:48.860
which sucks, 'cause I loved
working out there.

43:48.861 --> 43:50.152
It's inexpensive and,
truth be told,

43:50.153 --> 43:52.821
it's very, very clean.

43:54.866 --> 43:57.826
I mean, these
girls were bad, you know, so...

43:57.827 --> 43:58.952
But Clay, he introduces us.

43:58.953 --> 44:03.331
And the... and the girls ask
how we know each other.

44:03.332 --> 44:06.209
Clay looks at them
with a straight face and says,

44:06.210 --> 44:07.836
"We're cousins through rape."

44:10.256 --> 44:12.007
And then... and then,

44:12.008 --> 44:14.885
and then he goes on
to tell a story,

44:14.886 --> 44:17.179
a history lesson about
how the Moors were black

44:17.180 --> 44:19.931
and they invaded, raped,
and pillaged Sicily.

44:19.932 --> 44:22.809
But we are all one,
big happy family now,

44:22.810 --> 44:24.102
it's all in the past.

44:25.104 --> 44:27.856
Man, neither one of us
got laid that night.

44:29.275 --> 44:30.942
Clay was my man,
I tell you that.

44:30.943 --> 44:32.944
He was my man.

44:35.198 --> 44:37.866
Thank you.

44:54.884 --> 44:56.301
Hello, um,

44:56.302 --> 44:58.678
I know, uh,
none of you know us,

44:58.679 --> 45:01.723
me and my friend Ron.
Um.

45:01.724 --> 45:05.519
But, uh,
I knew Clay from

45:05.520 --> 45:08.563
back in Boston when his first
name was still Calogero.

45:08.564 --> 45:12.400
We were kids making pizzas
at Romero's,

45:12.401 --> 45:14.903
which was an authentic
Italian restaurant

45:14.904 --> 45:16.404
that was owned by
my Jewish uncle.

45:17.782 --> 45:21.326
Later, Clay got a job
at, uh, Combat Zone,

45:21.327 --> 45:23.286
doing comedy at a strip club.

45:23.287 --> 45:27.415
And I'd drive into Boston
and watch, and, uh...

45:27.416 --> 45:28.959
I mean, I was probably
the one guy there

45:28.960 --> 45:32.087
not to watch the strippers
but to watch Clay perform.

45:32.088 --> 45:34.798
And he'd be up there
telling these jokes about,

45:34.799 --> 45:37.092
about his family and
growing up in a small town,

45:37.093 --> 45:38.927
but, you know, they...
they weren't...

45:38.928 --> 45:42.013
they weren't jokes,
they were these...

45:42.014 --> 45:44.432
I don't know,
these secrets about himself.

45:44.433 --> 45:48.436
And, uh, one night
after closing,

45:48.437 --> 45:51.481
we, uh, went to the bar
for a beer.

45:51.482 --> 45:53.108
And, uh, I asked him
how does he

45:53.109 --> 45:54.526
get up in front of
all these drunks

45:54.527 --> 45:56.987
and, uh, make them laugh

45:56.988 --> 45:58.947
at the most

45:58.948 --> 46:01.575
embarrassing,
shameful,

46:01.576 --> 46:04.244
painful moments of his life.

46:04.245 --> 46:06.121
And, uh...

46:07.748 --> 46:09.875
he said it was
easier for him

46:09.876 --> 46:11.668
to confess the truth
about himself

46:11.669 --> 46:13.587
to a room full of
drunken strangers

46:13.588 --> 46:16.631
than it was to the people
he really loved.

46:19.552 --> 46:20.344
He was beautiful.

46:35.359 --> 46:36.401
Angelina.

46:36.402 --> 46:38.987
- Oh, Guy.
- We're leaving.

46:38.988 --> 46:40.155
You have to stay in here.
The stories about Calogero...

46:40.156 --> 46:41.990
We're leaving.

46:44.035 --> 46:45.410
Mr. Appuzzo, please,

46:45.411 --> 46:46.912
won't you join us,
just a little while?

46:46.913 --> 46:48.705
Have... have a seat, please.

46:48.706 --> 46:49.158
The...

46:50.666 --> 46:53.001
My son is dead.

46:53.002 --> 46:54.586
He was a child.

46:54.587 --> 46:55.754
He was always a child.

46:55.755 --> 46:57.797
You are children.

46:57.798 --> 47:00.217
You think you can
joke your way out of everything,

47:00.218 --> 47:02.093
pain, heartache,

47:02.094 --> 47:04.221
life!

47:04.222 --> 47:06.181
Go ahead.
Then what?

47:06.182 --> 47:07.474
It's all still there
waiting for you,

47:07.475 --> 47:09.517
waiting to be dealt with.

47:09.518 --> 47:11.061
You're children
with your eyes closed,

47:11.062 --> 47:13.021
thinking nobody can see you.

47:13.022 --> 47:13.814
I see you.

47:13.815 --> 47:15.816
I see right through all of you.

47:35.795 --> 47:37.295
Oh, shit!

47:37.296 --> 47:39.172
Honey, what are you doing?
The doctor said

47:39.173 --> 47:43.218
no destruction of property
until after the baby!

47:43.219 --> 47:45.011
It's the receipt
from your crab lotion.

47:45.012 --> 47:46.888
If you found out
about it this morning, then

47:46.889 --> 47:48.598
why is the receipt from two days
ago, you son of a bitch?

47:48.599 --> 47:50.558
No, not on my car!

47:50.559 --> 47:52.227
Bess, come here,
give me that...

47:52.228 --> 47:53.687
Can we... no-no-no-no, please,
come here, come-here,

47:53.688 --> 47:55.897
come here, stop, come on!

47:55.898 --> 47:57.065
Thought I got rid of those.

47:57.066 --> 48:02.904
Told you to keep your dick
in your skirt, didn't I?

48:02.905 --> 48:04.281
Mind if I grab a beer?

48:04.282 --> 48:06.741
I'll join you.

48:06.742 --> 48:08.410
Hey, hey, Goldie.
How you doing?

48:08.411 --> 48:09.494
I'm, uh, I'm Adam.
Adam Proteau.

48:09.495 --> 48:11.913
Yeah, I know who you are.

48:11.914 --> 48:14.040
Um, yeah, I know
now is a bad time, but I was...

48:14.041 --> 48:15.583
I said I know who you are.

48:15.584 --> 48:16.710
Why don't you quit
while you're ahead, huh?

48:37.606 --> 48:38.606
Come in.

48:38.607 --> 48:40.525
Oh, sweetie.
Hey, you look tired.

48:40.526 --> 48:41.568
You need a bump?

48:41.569 --> 48:43.320
I want to go up tonight.

48:43.321 --> 48:44.529
The Cellar's yours.
Name the time.

48:44.530 --> 48:46.614
Not The Cellar.

48:46.615 --> 48:48.200
The main room.

48:52.204 --> 48:53.705
What are you?

48:53.706 --> 48:54.956
Excuse me?

48:54.957 --> 48:56.666
I have no idea
what the fuck you are.

48:56.667 --> 48:58.335
I'm a comedian.

48:58.336 --> 49:00.754
What are you?

49:00.755 --> 49:04.090
You're funny,
I give you that.

49:04.091 --> 49:06.301
Phyllis Diller,
I know what she is.

49:06.302 --> 49:08.345
Joan Rivers, I get,
but you?

49:08.346 --> 49:10.305
No clue.

49:10.306 --> 49:10.806
You're all over the map.

49:10.807 --> 49:11.807
No point of view.

49:11.808 --> 49:15.310
You're sexy,
which is not a plus.

49:15.311 --> 49:16.228
They don't hear
half your jokes 'cause

49:16.229 --> 49:17.520
they're so busy
staring at your tits.

49:17.521 --> 49:19.898
So you go a little blue.

49:19.899 --> 49:21.524
And when you don't,
you're all

49:21.525 --> 49:24.152
"aw, shucks and cow shit."

49:24.153 --> 49:27.447
I have no idea what
your female perspective is.

49:27.448 --> 49:29.657
There is no one
female perspective,

49:29.658 --> 49:32.702
just like there is
no one guy perspective.

49:32.703 --> 49:35.580
We're not them, honey.

49:35.581 --> 49:36.165
You wanna go on
<i>The Tonight Show?</i>

49:36.166 --> 49:37.957
Yes.

49:37.958 --> 49:39.667
Let me help you, hmm?

49:39.668 --> 49:42.420
Find a voice
that women can relate to.

49:42.421 --> 49:43.463
I have a voice women...
that women relate to...

49:43.464 --> 49:48.009
That sheds light on
our mutual experiences, huh?

49:48.010 --> 49:49.761
Then I'll put you
on The Main Stage,

49:49.762 --> 49:50.721
front and center,

49:50.722 --> 49:52.055
my right hand to Carson.

49:52.056 --> 49:53.556
- Is Kaufman like Carlin?
- Ugh.

49:53.557 --> 49:54.557
Is Klein like Pryor?

49:54.558 --> 49:55.975
You're missing my point.

49:55.976 --> 49:58.186
Yet they're all
up there on your stage.

49:58.187 --> 50:00.146
Why is it any different
for women?

50:00.147 --> 50:02.899
There is room for me too, I just
need your stage to prove it.

50:02.900 --> 50:04.193
When you're ready.

50:17.081 --> 50:18.748
Word has is <i>The Tonight Show's</i>
gonna be

50:18.749 --> 50:22.210
laying off young comics
for a while.

50:22.211 --> 50:23.962
That the...

50:23.963 --> 50:25.630
rumors surrounding
Clay's death

50:25.631 --> 50:27.967
has them rethinking things.

50:33.722 --> 50:35.807
Your point?

50:35.808 --> 50:38.393
<i>The LA Times</i>
is doing an interview

50:38.394 --> 50:40.061
with me tomorrow.

50:40.062 --> 50:40.896
They want me to
set the record straight

50:40.897 --> 50:44.316
about Clay,
about his death...

50:45.359 --> 50:48.903
The truth.

50:48.904 --> 50:50.030
And what is the truth?

50:52.366 --> 50:54.742
You tell me.

50:56.871 --> 50:58.830
At least now
I know what you are.

51:02.751 --> 51:04.836
<i>Guys,
Vietnam's coming to an end.</i>

51:04.837 --> 51:06.296
<i>That means what?</i>

51:06.297 --> 51:07.256
<i>Yes, the draft
is coming to an end.</i>

51:07.257 --> 51:09.007
<i>It's so nice.
Comedians are coming home</i>

51:09.008 --> 51:11.593
from Canada,
'cause they're pussies, right?

51:11.594 --> 51:13.595
Ugh, they are not known
for their bravery, man.

51:13.596 --> 51:15.138
They're known for what?
Say it with me.

51:15.139 --> 51:17.348
Big penises.
Nobody said it, that's weird.

51:17.349 --> 51:19.601
That's a "no" in the back?
Is that... yeah, that's my wife.

51:19.602 --> 51:21.060
How are you... oh, wait,
that's not her.

51:21.061 --> 51:22.770
I'm just kidding.
She didn't make it

51:22.771 --> 51:24.606
through surgery, she's dead.
How are you?

51:24.607 --> 51:26.316
Ugh, I just... gonna...
I'ma need you to hold this.

51:26.317 --> 51:28.193
Just put it between
your breasts, that's fine, um.

51:28.194 --> 51:30.487
I'll come get it later.
Great, so...

51:30.488 --> 51:32.071
Man, we hate to fight.

51:32.072 --> 51:34.032
We'll make a white flag
out of anything, right?

51:34.033 --> 51:34.992
We'll make a white flag out of
a fuckin' black flag.

51:34.993 --> 51:37.702
Where are you
in all this, Cass?

51:39.413 --> 51:43.291
All those jokes about being
a single gal from Wink, Texas.

51:45.461 --> 51:47.504
Fuck, the bartender
can tell jokes.

51:50.049 --> 51:51.466
Real laughter...

51:53.677 --> 51:57.347
It's cathartic.

51:57.348 --> 51:59.390
It's the current that
moves through an audience

51:59.391 --> 52:01.476
when some truth
about who you are,

52:01.477 --> 52:03.603
about who they are,
is revealed.

52:04.772 --> 52:07.982
Come on, Cass, you gotta
go out there and put those arms

52:07.983 --> 52:10.693
around that messy part of
yourself and just...

52:18.035 --> 52:20.078
Get your ass on that stage.

52:20.079 --> 52:22.705
Figure out what it is
that you have to say,

52:22.706 --> 52:26.209
open a vein, and...

52:26.210 --> 52:28.002
fuckin' say it.

52:28.003 --> 52:29.629
That's it, I'm
Sully Patterson, thank you guys!

52:31.840 --> 52:34.551
Yeah, give it up for
Sully Paterson, a...

52:34.552 --> 52:37.345
genuine war hero
right there, man.

52:37.346 --> 52:39.222
Coming to the stage next
right now is a real treat.

52:39.223 --> 52:41.182
It's her first time
on the main room stage,

52:41.183 --> 52:44.727
and quite frankly
it's about motherfucking time.

52:44.728 --> 52:47.522
Easy on the eyes,
and funny as hell,

52:47.523 --> 52:48.815
give it up for
Cassie Feder!

53:00.494 --> 53:01.619
Hey, y'all.

53:04.540 --> 53:06.541
Yes, I am from Texas.

53:06.542 --> 53:08.793
We do say "y'all."

53:08.794 --> 53:10.795
Y'all's actually
Texas shorthand for

53:10.796 --> 53:13.006
"We will shoot you,
all of you."

53:14.758 --> 53:17.844
You know what's great
about being a single gal

53:17.845 --> 53:20.054
in Texas?

53:20.055 --> 53:22.557
Is making out in pickup trucks.

53:22.558 --> 53:26.394
Girls, you have not lived
until you find yourself

53:26.395 --> 53:28.313
in a lip lock
with a farm boy

53:28.314 --> 53:29.856
who spent his afternoon

53:29.857 --> 53:30.774
watching his daddy's cows hump.

53:51.462 --> 53:54.172
You ever have life
pull a trick on you

53:54.173 --> 53:56.342
that you just
did not see coming?

53:58.052 --> 53:59.385
You're just walking along,

53:59.386 --> 54:03.348
all happy and stupid,
and wham.

54:03.349 --> 54:06.142
Without you even realizing it,
life just

54:06.143 --> 54:09.480
bends you over and tucks it
straight up your ass?

54:12.983 --> 54:15.985
I lost a friend recently.

54:15.986 --> 54:17.695
An ex-boyfriend, actually.

54:18.657 --> 54:21.616
Man...

54:21.617 --> 54:24.160
Did I ever love him.

54:24.161 --> 54:28.122
He was Italian and swarthy.

54:28.123 --> 54:29.707
And he had these, um,

54:29.708 --> 54:32.168
these big blue eyes.

54:32.169 --> 54:34.671
And not that he couldn't
be a dick too, 'cause he could.

54:34.672 --> 54:36.631
Get her the fuck off the stag...

54:36.632 --> 54:37.632
What?
For what?

54:37.633 --> 54:39.300
Here I was,

54:39.301 --> 54:43.054
this Jew from Wink, Texas.

54:43.055 --> 54:45.306
Let me just put that
in perspective for you.

54:45.307 --> 54:47.809
There's more Jews at
a Walt Disney dinner party

54:47.810 --> 54:49.310
than there are in all of Wink.

54:51.480 --> 54:53.398
And I met my ex,
and, man,

54:53.399 --> 54:56.234
I was just overmatched
right from the start.

54:56.235 --> 54:59.153
You know you are overmatched
when you end up

54:59.154 --> 55:00.030
blowing a guy
on the first date.

55:00.031 --> 55:02.323
That's it.
The end.

55:02.324 --> 55:03.283
You know what I'm talking about.

55:03.284 --> 55:05.868
I can see you've done that
a few times,

55:05.869 --> 55:07.662
haven't you, young lady?

55:07.663 --> 55:10.331
I mean, I don't even
know what happened, really.

55:10.332 --> 55:11.791
I was at dinner.
I was smiling.

55:11.792 --> 55:14.252
I was nodding.

55:14.253 --> 55:16.254
I was so interested in
everything he was saying.

55:16.255 --> 55:19.048
One second, "Oh, my gosh,
lasagna Thanksgiving

55:19.049 --> 55:22.009
instead of turkey?
No."

55:22.010 --> 55:23.761
And then the next second, I'm
in the front seat of his Valiant

55:23.762 --> 55:26.973
blowing him, wondering what
our kids are gonna look like.

55:28.684 --> 55:30.977
If it's a boy,

55:30.978 --> 55:32.854
let's name 'em 'Arry a...

55:37.776 --> 55:39.569
And if it's a girl,

55:39.570 --> 55:42.864
I'll name her Candace.

55:43.533 --> 55:46.242
I was so happy to be there

55:46.243 --> 55:50.496
that I said thank you to him
afterwards.

55:52.291 --> 55:53.875
I don't know what happened.

55:53.876 --> 55:55.626
I didn't blow guys in Wink.

55:55.627 --> 55:57.044
And then I'm in L. A.
for one month,

55:57.045 --> 55:59.714
and I'm really thinking

55:59.715 --> 56:01.466
about getting
my tonsils taken out

56:01.467 --> 56:03.342
for performance purposes.

56:03.343 --> 56:05.845
If my uncle knew
what was going on,

56:05.846 --> 56:07.638
I could just see him.

56:07.639 --> 56:11.517
I can't believe
you're sucking Italian dick.

56:11.518 --> 56:12.852
That's disgusting.

56:12.853 --> 56:14.896
You got perfectly good
cousin dick

56:14.897 --> 56:16.230
right ch'ere in Wink!

56:44.927 --> 56:46.677
Oh, great.

56:46.678 --> 56:48.888
I gotta take a piss.

56:48.889 --> 56:49.848
When's this prick
gonna shoot his wad?

56:51.308 --> 56:53.935
Ooh, yeah.
Oh, my God, yeah, oh!

56:53.936 --> 56:55.436
You know
Lenny Bruce's first paying gig

56:55.437 --> 56:59.357
was for 12 dollars and
a free plate of spaghetti?

56:59.358 --> 57:01.901
I would kill for
some spaghetti right now.

57:01.902 --> 57:03.194
Fucking starving.

57:07.241 --> 57:08.616
Z?

57:08.617 --> 57:09.243
Yeah?

57:09.244 --> 57:11.118
Where the fuck are we?

57:15.875 --> 57:18.125
Hollywood, brotha.

57:27.928 --> 57:29.220
Thank you.
