How about we both
get onboard?

10:09.376 --> 10:10.575
Hold on tight.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.619
Thanks for the rescue,
pups.

11:27.621 --> 11:28.787
Both of them.

11:28.789 --> 11:29.988
Ah, yes. Thank--

11:29.990 --> 11:31.156
(Sneezing)
--you.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.691
(Sniffling):
Very much.

11:32.693 --> 11:35.460
Whenever you're in trouble,
just yelp for help.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.594
Like this?

11:36.596 --> 11:40.231
<i> Aah! I found the whale!</i>

11:40.233 --> 11:42.333
Oh, the whale.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.968

than kite surfing.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.691
Just snag some breeze.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.527
This is definitely cooler.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.931
Told you you had awesome
kite surfing skills.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.202

Wow, Marshall.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.872

Yikes! Too high.

Uh-oh.

12:34.488 --> 12:36.254
Nice barrel roll,

12:36.256 --> 12:38.990
I can barrel-y believe it
myself.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.126

12:41.128 --> 12:43.595
Okay, Alex,
as soon as the train stops,

12:43.597 --> 12:45.997
let's hustle the frozen fish
into the van.

to all the fish?

12:57.410 --> 12:58.476
(Squawking)

12:58.478 --> 13:02.313
ALEX:
Grandpa, you ordered penguins!

13:02.315 --> 13:03.448
Awesome!

13:03.450 --> 13:04.682
I ordered fish.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.218
But it looks like these
stowaway penguins

13:07.220 --> 13:08.820
ate the whole order.

13:08.822 --> 13:12.190
Wait, Adventure Bay
is no place for penguins.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.392
Especially on such a hot day.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.394
We'll have to catch them.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.562
Whoa!

13:17.564 --> 13:19.097
Oh, I'm okay.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.765
We need help.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.301

13:23.303 --> 13:24.669

<i> They must have snuck</i>
<i> onto the train.</i>

13:44.357 --> 13:47.125
<i> They ate all the frozen fish</i>
<i> and then ran off.</i>

13:47.127 --> 13:48.526
<i> Can you help round them up,</i>
<i> Ryder?</i>

13:48.528 --> 13:50.028
We'll find them, Mr. Porter.

your beach day, pups,

14:46.887 --> 14:49.454
Mr. Porter and Alex
were picking up frozen food,

14:49.456 --> 14:51.289
but got penguins instead.

Yay! Penguins!

14:53.059 --> 14:54.692
The cute little birds
ran off.

14:54.694 --> 14:58.263
And it's way too hot for them
to be out in Adventure Bay.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.565
We need to get them
back to the freezer car.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.143
With your drone, you can find
the sneakiest penguin,

15:12.145 --> 15:13.544
then catch him
with your net.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.947
Spy Chase is on the case.

15:15.949 --> 15:19.017

feel so great

in this heat.

just belly flop for help.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.510
(All laughing)

21:52.512 --> 21:55.613
Snug as an ice cube
in a freezer.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.282
All ready to go!

21:59.652 --> 22:01.152
(Train whistle blowing)

22:01.154 --> 22:03.554
RYDER:
They'll be back
in their icy homes soon.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.690
Now that the penguins
are headed home,

22:05.692 --> 22:08.292
we can get back
to our beach day.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.928
(All cheering)

22:10.930 --> 22:13.097
For helping catch
those penguins,

22:13.099 --> 22:14.365
I brought ice pops.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.766
ALL:
Yay! Whoo-hoo!

22:15.768 --> 22:17.668
And I brought
a slippery slide.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.637
Ready, set, get wet.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.005
Whoo-hoo!

22:21.007 --> 22:22.206
(All laughing)

22:23.376 --> 22:25.042
Awesome.

22:25.044 --> 22:28.412
Hmm, belly slide
or belly treat?

22:28.414 --> 22:30.014
I know.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.717
Quick treat first,
then slide.

22:35.188 --> 22:39.056
Oh, brain freeze,
brain freeze.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.925
Whoa!

22:41.728 --> 22:43.094
(Splashing)
(Laughing)

22:44.130 --> 22:45.296
(Sighing)

22:45.298 --> 22:46.664
That's better.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.232
(All laughing)
RYDER:
Oh, Marshall.
