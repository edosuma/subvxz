00:17.194 --> 00:19.738
<i>But there's one man who
sees them differently.</i>

00:20.376 --> 00:23.529
If I build her that she'll be
going "what's been going on?".

00:25.741 --> 00:27.286
<i>Karl Pilkington.</i>

00:27.673 --> 00:30.242
- Close your mouth.
- I don't know the politically

00:30.272 --> 00:31.272
correct term. Moron.

00:31.613 --> 00:39.022
I think he is a round, empty-headed
chimp-like moron, buffoon idiot.

00:39.052 --> 00:41.248
- Is that normal?
- And he's a friend!

00:41.686 --> 00:45.300
He's a typical englander and he doesn't
like going out of his comfort zone.

00:45.533 --> 00:47.180
Bollocks are squashed.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.744
I just think it would be amazing
to send him around the world.

00:52.359 --> 00:56.686
<i>What we'd like to see is him
experience other cultures,</i>

00:56.716 --> 01:01.952
other peoples and see if in any way we
can change his outlook on the world.

01:01.982 --> 01:05.655
I've been to many exotic places.
I genuinely think travel broadens the mind.

01:05.685 --> 01:07.142
I want him to hate it.

01:07.752 --> 01:10.804
I want him to hate every minute
of it for my own amusement.

01:10.834 --> 01:12.883
The lights are changing. Lights, lights!

01:12.913 --> 01:18.125
<i>Nothing is funnier than Karl in a
corner being poked by a stick.</i>

01:18.763 --> 01:22.794
I am that stick, and now I have
the might of sky behind me.

01:23.831 --> 01:25.023
Shit!

01:25.053 --> 01:28.771
This is one of the funniest most
expensive practical jokes I've ever done

01:29.099 --> 01:30.773

01:31.279 --> 01:34.416

Karl. We're sending you to
see Christ the redeemer.

01:43.733 --> 01:49.461
Magnificent religious symbol that towers
down over Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.

01:49.491 --> 01:53.188
What's your first thoughts of it?
Look how big that statue is.

01:53.218 --> 01:56.770
I just think of the
people who live in Rio,

01:56.800 --> 02:01.242
right, they've got that there every day
when they leave the house, they see it.

02:01.272 --> 02:03.578
- Yeah.
- Oh, it's there again.

02:03.608 --> 02:06.080
Sick of seeing it.
It's like a pylon to them.

02:07.885 --> 02:09.633
You get sick of it.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.841
It's a good place to meet.
You know, you can see it from everywhere.

02:13.871 --> 02:16.630
I don't think it was built as a
rendezvous point, to be fair.

02:16.660 --> 02:19.332
I think it has also something to do with
the spirituality of the country but...

02:19.362 --> 02:22.699
It's not just that you'll be seeing.
You'll be experiencing Brazil as well.

02:22.729 --> 02:24.320
A magnificent country.

02:24.350 --> 02:26.364
You know the carnivale is
gonna be on when you're there.

02:26.394 --> 02:27.955
Oh, gays, isn't it?

02:28.023 --> 02:30.000
Is... does that...

02:30.154 --> 02:34.700
Do you feel like you have to be part of
that to enjoy it or do you feel left out?

02:35.021 --> 02:36.581
- I'm stunned.
- Well...

02:36.611 --> 02:39.425
I don't... he's so confused
because I don't think

02:39.455 --> 02:42.303
Rio carnivale is known
specifically for its gay fans.

02:42.933 --> 02:48.287
There are... there are a lot of men
with tans and opposing pouches.

02:48.317 --> 02:50.438
Listen, if you want to see a guy in
a Speedo and there's nothing else

02:50.468 --> 02:52.018
this is the place to go Karl,
if that's what you...

02:52.048 --> 02:53.530
That's what I mean.
I'm not really into that.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.720
- Can we make a note to make sure...?
- Can we, can we...?

02:55.750 --> 02:58.289
Will you please at least
get in the spirit?

02:58.945 --> 03:02.656
I'm not doing anything that I
wouldn't normally do on holiday.

03:03.456 --> 03:05.530
When you're on the beach
you're in trunks, aren't you?

03:05.560 --> 03:07.452
No, I don't. I just wear shorts.

03:07.585 --> 03:09.143
So, how short?

03:09.173 --> 03:11.960
How short... what's the shortest
shorts you'd be willing to wear?

03:13.350 --> 03:15.982
- Would you wear hot pants?
- No there's no need for that.

03:16.012 --> 03:18.844
There's no need. No need
to wear trunks like that.

03:18.874 --> 03:20.437
No, I'm not doing anything
for the cameras. I'm not...

03:20.467 --> 03:21.409
Red braces?

03:21.439 --> 03:23.264
I'm just going to go.
I'm going to go look at this.

03:23.294 --> 03:26.410
That's all I'm doing. I don't need to
go to the gay parade. There's no need.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.400
- It's not a gay parade.
- It's not a gay parade.

Is that the Jesus thing on the ***?
Do you see alright, on the hill?

04:01.969 --> 04:03.869
Yeah, that's the Jesus thing.

04:04.393 --> 04:06.645
Not as big as I thought it would be.

04:06.675 --> 04:10.021
What do you think of this?
This is copacabana beach.

04:11.201 --> 04:12.533
It's alright, isn't it?

04:12.563 --> 04:15.290
I mean, I don't know I didn't come
for that. I meant to be looking

04:15.320 --> 04:17.107
at the Jesus thing, but...

04:17.742 --> 04:19.678
This makes the Jesus
thing better, doesn't it?

04:20.096 --> 04:23.519
That's like a nice little added extra.
You're on the beach, have a look up.

04:23.549 --> 04:25.627
There it is. There's
that thing that's in the films.

04:25.657 --> 04:27.462
Alright. Going swimming again.

04:28.462 --> 04:29.509
Still hot.

04:31.274 --> 04:33.380
I mean, is it normal
to have sweaty ears?

04:33.410 --> 04:35.860
I've never had a sweaty ear in my life.

anything and they're hot.

the place that Ricky and

04:46.899 --> 04:48.617
Steve have sorted out
for me to stay at.

04:48.737 --> 04:50.538
I don't know anything
about it other than

04:50.568 --> 04:52.946
they said that it was a
good place to meet people.

04:52.976 --> 04:54.884
I don't know what that means.

04:54.914 --> 04:56.442
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:56.641 --> 04:59.098
- I'm Karl.
- Welcome to pirates of Ipanema.

04:59.343 --> 05:02.235
- So this is your cafe, isn't it?
- Yeah. Let's go man.

05:03.518 --> 05:04.795
This is the kitchen.

05:04.825 --> 05:08.529
And when you cook anything,
you try to keep clean the area, ok?

05:08.767 --> 05:11.746
Don't tell me that. Tell the
last fella who came here...

05:12.955 --> 05:19.348
This normally, it's a place for a pool
table, but in carnivale man, stay crazy.

05:19.548 --> 05:24.335
With a 100 persons inside of the house, ok?
And the people sleep in their mattress...

05:24.365 --> 05:25.725
There's going to be a
hundred people in there?

05:25.755 --> 05:28.992
Yeah, people sleep there man.
Pay more cheaper but sleep there.

05:29.022 --> 05:30.254
Cause it's crazy.

05:30.284 --> 05:31.884

Close off the window.

05:38.827 --> 05:42.152
How much is it here? How much is it
normally to stay here for a night?

05:42.182 --> 05:43.639
Four pound point five.

05:44.286 --> 05:47.456
Have you got anything for about six
quid? Just a little bit better?

05:47.486 --> 05:50.603
Anything for just a little bit.
Just a little bit. Just...

05:50.991 --> 05:52.739
Around six or seven pounds?

05:53.288 --> 05:55.254
No, man, no. We don't have.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.330
All right.

He's rough in here. Then is roughing it.

06:02.122 --> 06:03.410
This isn't proper roughing it.

06:13.933 --> 06:16.572
Four quid. I think it's overpriced.

06:30.634 --> 06:34.048
Ricky and Steve thought you needed
to socialize with other people,

06:34.442 --> 06:36.111
- so that's why they put you...
- I'm not socializing.

And I'm old in the age now.

06:39.670 --> 06:41.475

06:41.671 --> 06:45.622
I've always said you only need seven
mates to get you through life, that's it,

06:45.652 --> 06:48.045
that's why... you know, I've mentioned
snow white with the midgets.

I just found out that
the Rio carnivale is on

06:54.737 --> 06:57.389
which is a big dance thing that
they do every year in Brazil.

06:57.595 --> 06:59.664
Ricky and Steve are
probably aware of this.

06:59.702 --> 07:01.570
That's why they sent me here
at this time of year, you know,

07:01.608 --> 07:03.561
because they know I don't like crowds,

07:03.598 --> 07:06.227
they know I don't like parties.
So to them this is hilarious.

07:07.369 --> 07:10.880

gonna teach me how to do the samba.

back up here later,

13:28.179 --> 13:30.364
they might be quiet,
don't wake him up, he's old.

13:34.078 --> 13:36.231
I'll be happier in an old people zone.

13:37.518 --> 13:38.778
Seriously.

13:42.074 --> 13:43.661
They'd all be in bed now.

14:08.724 --> 14:09.859
Did you sleep?

14:10.109 --> 14:11.343
What a bollocks.

14:11.787 --> 14:13.244
Can you sleep in this?

14:13.992 --> 14:16.362
I can't do this.
Seriously, I can't do it.

14:19.408 --> 14:23.810
I'm *** Ricky and Steve sort of do this.
Cause that isn't what it's about.

14:31.430 --> 14:32.902
Cause I'll tell you what.

14:32.932 --> 14:34.302
They wouldn't do it.

14:38.154 --> 14:40.227
Ricky and Steve wouldn't be doing it.

14:40.257 --> 14:41.671
You know what I mean?

14:42.872 --> 14:44.839
There's no way Steve could hack it here.

14:44.869 --> 14:47.804
He goes home to his mum and
dad's when he's got a cold.

14:48.396 --> 14:49.506
You know that?

14:50.305 --> 14:51.305
***

15:01.498 --> 15:05.395
it's not the first time I've
seen that since I've been here.

15:05.829 --> 15:08.520
I don't really get the impression
it's that religious to be honest.

15:08.924 --> 15:11.569
I suppose with... a lot of
religious people it's...

15:11.689 --> 15:14.357
It's about covering up, isn't it,
and being quiet...

15:14.395 --> 15:15.982
you know, not being sexy.

15:16.025 --> 15:17.997
Where is here? You feel like
you've been out with some of the woman

15:18.117 --> 15:20.110
you've seen that much of them.

15:20.230 --> 15:21.956
You know, everything's
on show, isn't it?

15:21.982 --> 15:23.618
There's nothing left to
the imagination here.

15:23.646 --> 15:27.976
I mean, look at him. No shame.
Just naked out for a loaf.

15:28.018 --> 15:30.345
When I go to bed I'm normally
wearing more than that,

15:30.465 --> 15:32.328
just in case something
happens in the night.

15:32.448 --> 15:34.899
A fire alarm goes off or something,
you got to leave the house.

15:36.305 --> 15:41.634
I'm here in Brazil to see Christ the
redeemer, right? The wonder of the world.

15:41.664 --> 15:44.524
The reason why I'm meant to be here
and yet Ricky and Steve are saying

15:44.554 --> 15:47.020
don't be worrying about that.
We got some other plans for you.

15:47.050 --> 15:49.426
You know, get down to the beach
and meet this local fellow.

15:49.456 --> 15:51.943
He's name is Salso, you know,
he's going to show you around the place.

15:51.973 --> 15:54.561
- It's you.
- Yeah.

15:55.059 --> 15:56.560
- I'm Salso, how are you?
- Salso.

15:56.590 --> 15:58.369
- Nice to meeting you.
- How are you doing?

15:58.399 --> 15:59.908
- I'm very well, thank you.
- Well, sit down.

15:59.938 --> 16:01.181
No, I don't want to sit down.

16:01.211 --> 16:07.814
I just want to give you something that the
first contact we always have to wear it.

16:13.242 --> 16:14.242
Condoms.

16:14.744 --> 16:18.915
I've never had that as a gift, or at a
first meeting before. A little bit forward.

16:19.796 --> 16:20.909
Yeah.

16:23.584 --> 16:24.659
Sit down.

16:25.557 --> 16:27.149
Tell me what's going on.

16:27.179 --> 16:28.854
You will see in a minute.

16:29.604 --> 16:31.583
Why is there no other men in here?

16:31.700 --> 16:33.331
Why is there no other men?

16:34.428 --> 16:36.917
There's a woman looking
at me in a funny way.

16:36.947 --> 16:40.160
They have a woman here but they have
a lot of men that come here too.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.098
You have known me for a bit.

16:42.896 --> 16:44.694
Would I be happy with this.

16:46.026 --> 16:47.186
Wait.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.203
Well, you know those guys that do surf.

16:54.101 --> 16:55.197
They wax here.

16:55.227 --> 16:56.684
Would you like to try?

16:58.629 --> 16:59.630
Not really.

16:59.703 --> 17:03.297
Do I seem like the sort of block
who has a wax. I'm like an ape.

17:03.327 --> 17:06.733
Well, you look nice to have a wax.
It's going to work. A lot.

17:06.844 --> 17:09.083
Yeah but... my girlfriend
likes it. She likes that.

17:09.113 --> 17:10.771
- Does she?
- Yeah, she loves it.

17:10.801 --> 17:12.079
She loves the hairy bit.

17:13.002 --> 17:15.173
I can get out while you
get undress if you want.

17:15.203 --> 17:16.203
No, no.

17:24.589 --> 17:27.263
Why don't you try even on
your arms a little bit?

17:27.586 --> 17:29.886
I feel much better without the hair.

17:30.423 --> 17:31.532
Yeah.

17:34.237 --> 17:37.079
Well, that bit you're having down there,
I wouldn't mind getting that done

17:37.109 --> 17:38.970
cause sometimes I have
to tuck it in my pants.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.200
That's a sign it's a bit too long, isn't
it, when you have to start tucking it in.

17:44.744 --> 17:46.071
Uh Jesus, it's hot.

17:46.117 --> 17:49.130
Relax. If you don't relax,
you won't enjoy it.

17:49.193 --> 17:54.191
Oh, Jesus. That's bad bad.
That is bad. She took a bit there.

17:54.312 --> 17:56.812
Just a little bit.
Just to see if it's ready.

17:57.765 --> 17:58.893
Ah, Jesus!

18:00.847 --> 18:02.000
Is he bleeding?

18:02.316 --> 18:03.860
There's two other parts.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.401
If I left it, it would look stupid?

18:06.431 --> 18:07.711
Oh, it's not good.

18:07.741 --> 18:09.662
It seems that you have something here.

18:09.692 --> 18:11.680
She shouldn't be laughing, to be honest.

18:14.751 --> 18:16.430
Oh, you look so clean.

18:17.311 --> 18:18.475
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:18.505 --> 18:20.298
You look nice, really nice.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.920
I suppose it's good for me to meet
different kinds of people, isn't it?

18:24.121 --> 18:27.280
You know, there's no point having
mates who are all the same.

18:27.532 --> 18:31.726
Let's see some bum bum.
Something for the beach.

18:32.035 --> 18:35.417
- What do you think?
- I... I don't think this is necessary.

18:35.592 --> 18:38.092
I mean, salso is different
to my other mates.

18:39.265 --> 18:41.174
He'd be like a new addition.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.537
Would you like to see
some of this over there?

18:43.567 --> 18:45.367
To see which one fits on you?

18:45.403 --> 18:48.204
No honestly, I don't want a pair.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.202
You see, there's nothing
wrong with these.

18:51.232 --> 18:53.732
Do you know what I mean?
That's all you need.

19:04.461 --> 19:08.020
I don't know if I'm seeing the
real Brazil, to be honest.

19:13.809 --> 19:17.516
No, I just mean in terms
of what I've been up to.

19:17.578 --> 19:23.174
♪

19:29.536 --> 19:30.668
Here I am.

19:30.763 --> 19:31.872
How do I look?

19:35.755 --> 19:37.904
No. Well, he... he bought me some.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.336
Yeah, it's not... it's madness.

19:50.801 --> 19:53.562
I don't understand why you
need that much of a tan.

19:53.598 --> 19:58.355
When I get home I won't be saying: "Look
at the core of me, weeping my ars out".

19:59.065 --> 20:01.561
Just the face.

20:16.031 --> 20:17.418
You're feeling hot, aren't you?

20:17.448 --> 20:19.924
Well, I'm not used to this.
My feet are killing me.

20:19.954 --> 20:22.585
How about the thing that
I bought you yesterday?

20:22.724 --> 20:25.833
Don't you feel comfortable now
that it's so hot to wear it?

20:26.328 --> 20:27.751
Because I'm going to wear mine.

20:27.781 --> 20:29.977
- I'm already wearing it.
- No, they would see my ars

20:30.005 --> 20:34.679
and they'd be looking at it
and going "oh, look at the state of him".

20:35.121 --> 20:36.642
Nobody is going to look at you.

20:36.672 --> 20:37.920
They are, they are.

20:40.835 --> 20:44.018
I have to tell you a story
about this part of the beach.

20:44.138 --> 20:46.898
On the '70s all the artists
used to come here

20:46.917 --> 20:49.612
to smoke marijuana
and do this kind of stuff.

20:49.642 --> 20:56.019
And then since then, this part of the beach
become a very famous and a gay beach too.

20:56.246 --> 20:58.120
And I would like to sit
down because I'm tired.

20:58.139 --> 20:59.808
We've been walking Miles.
Just keep going

20:59.838 --> 21:02.130
- for another couple of minutes.
- Oh, I'm so tired.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.633
- I would like to sit down.
- Come on.

21:04.663 --> 21:07.660
I mean, it's good seeing this
but... let's keep walking.

21:07.919 --> 21:10.739
Bloody hell... another two
minutes and we'll be out of it.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.289
- Come on.
- We can but I would like to sit down.

21:13.319 --> 21:14.596
Don't worry about it.

21:14.626 --> 21:16.625
It's a beach like any other beach.

21:16.655 --> 21:20.695
Yeah but it's... honestly, do you know
what I'm talking about, being closed in.

21:20.739 --> 21:22.736
I love this weather.

21:22.860 --> 21:26.097
- Yeah, I'm not enjoying...
- This wind, so delicious.

21:26.305 --> 21:28.320
No, there's a chair for us to sit down.

21:28.503 --> 21:29.656
I need a chair.

21:35.675 --> 21:36.729
Delicious.

21:36.824 --> 21:40.751
Massive beach, but so air. Lovely.

21:40.822 --> 21:45.297
Oh, I'm sorry, but I have to take
my shirt off because it's too hot.

21:49.335 --> 21:53.437
- Are you gay or...
- What do you think?

21:54.566 --> 21:56.359
- It's hard to tell.
- Mmh?

21:56.389 --> 21:57.672
It's hard to tell.

22:01.481 --> 22:02.880
There is a friend of mine.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.967
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you doing?

22:09.997 --> 22:11.106
Yeah, marcelo.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.874
- Marcelo, I'm Karl.
- Nice to meet you, hi Karl.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.783
- How you doin'?
- Welcome to Rio.

22:15.813 --> 22:18.688
- You're happy.
- But look, you're frying over there.

22:18.843 --> 22:19.943
No, I'm fine.

22:19.973 --> 22:24.155
Cause I've got... I've got a few...
I've got protection. No, honestly.

22:26.051 --> 22:28.400
It's like, please your ego.

22:28.999 --> 22:31.197
You have novelty value.

22:31.269 --> 22:34.562
You're so whity and you get pinky.

22:34.624 --> 22:36.038
It's a lovely colour.

22:36.345 --> 22:37.700
Like really really lovely.

22:37.730 --> 22:40.810
Different from everyone else.
People like the difference.

22:40.941 --> 22:43.848
So why do you have to hide your beauty?

22:43.950 --> 22:45.889
I just... I keep it for my girlfriend.

22:45.919 --> 22:47.614
- A girlfriend?
- Yeah, yeah.

22:47.644 --> 22:49.264
Why do you mean the others?

22:49.294 --> 22:50.415
What others?

22:50.465 --> 22:53.746
Why do you mean the rest of humanity?

22:53.816 --> 22:55.914
You just need to be looked at.

22:55.976 --> 22:57.507
This is what the beach is all about.

22:57.537 --> 22:59.528
That's why I don't come here that much.

22:59.558 --> 23:00.681
I don't like to be looked at.

23:00.711 --> 23:03.160
I just thought...
Let's go for a quiet walk.

23:03.190 --> 23:04.589
- I'd love a quiet walk.
- Really?

23:04.619 --> 23:05.685
Look at this.

23:12.624 --> 23:16.525
I'm going to have some massage and
I would like you guys to join me.

23:16.727 --> 23:19.107
No, I watch. I don't need one.

23:21.048 --> 23:23.121
Ok. Thank you.

23:34.343 --> 23:36.987
I'll tell you what. He should have had
his ass done yesterday, shouldn't he?

23:37.017 --> 23:39.996
He had his back and his front,
look at that, over there.

23:41.973 --> 23:46.158
You know, to think that earlier on I
was asking whether he's gay or not.

23:46.261 --> 23:47.918
I feel a bit daft now.

23:51.620 --> 23:54.127
I don't want to moan,
do you know what I mean?

23:54.165 --> 23:56.418
I know I'm quite lucky
to do what I'm doing.

23:56.457 --> 24:00.066
But I thought the idea was that Ricky
and Steve wanted me to broaden my mind.

24:00.096 --> 24:01.671
That's what this is all about but...

24:01.762 --> 24:04.490
Being in that carnivale yesterday
that hadn't broaden my mind, did it?

24:04.520 --> 24:06.363
That just knackered my legs up.

24:06.393 --> 24:08.626
You know, I'm here to see Christ the
redeemer, the wonder of the world.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.277
Why can't I just see that and go home?

24:10.307 --> 24:14.329
But now they're calling up and saying "why
don't you go and see a block party?".

24:14.821 --> 24:16.783
Just seem they have a party
for any occasion really.

24:16.821 --> 24:18.811
It doesn't have to be
a birthday, it's just...

24:18.931 --> 24:20.930
It's a Wednesday. It's a get together.

24:21.050 --> 24:26.317
So, yeah, that's what a block party is,
just going along with hundreds of people.

24:26.485 --> 24:30.952
You know I don't like to be in crowds
but apparently you get quite busy.

24:35.929 --> 24:37.422
The closest thing I've probably done

24:37.542 --> 24:38.962
to this block party is when

24:39.082 --> 24:42.376
I was a kid and there was the queen of ***,

24:42.496 --> 24:45.350
and like, you know,
people turned up on the street.

24:45.470 --> 24:47.206
You brought your own food.

24:47.381 --> 24:49.447
Everyone had a good time and went home.

24:49.477 --> 24:51.774
I didn't enjoy that.
I remember my mom being annoyed

24:51.804 --> 24:53.968
that scruffy son returned
up and upload the trifle.

24:53.998 --> 24:55.629
You didn't bring anything.

25:01.589 --> 25:04.698
It's basically a big queue with
someone playing some music.

25:04.877 --> 25:07.247
Except I don't know
what I'm queueing for.

25:08.740 --> 25:11.808
*** some silly wigs and stuff.
Maybe I'm miserable.

25:11.895 --> 25:13.855
Maybe I'm the only one here
who isn't enjoying it.

25:13.885 --> 25:16.420
But... if I'm not enjoying it,
I shouldn't be here.

25:16.450 --> 25:18.504
I know this isn't for me.

25:20.038 --> 25:22.604
My ears just haven't stop
since I've been here.

25:22.724 --> 25:24.397
I get off the plane they were sweating.

25:24.517 --> 25:30.136
I've never had sweaty ears. And since then
been overworked with constant, you know,

25:30.234 --> 25:41.162
drums, singing, whistles,
chanting, dogs, helicopters.

25:41.242 --> 25:43.535
- Gays.
- Want a massage for your ego?

25:44.003 --> 25:46.655
Gays wouldn't normally be on that list,

25:46.775 --> 25:49.304
but the one I'm with
just didn't want to shut up.

25:49.424 --> 25:52.301
Great place to live if you're deaf.

25:53.059 --> 25:57.119
That what I'd say about Rio.
Lovely and relaxing... if you're deaf.

26:04.622 --> 26:07.723
Oh, I left that in the end. ***

26:09.486 --> 26:14.573
yeah... it was ridicoulous. I mean, I'm
not that fussy and that, but it was mingy.

26:14.603 --> 26:18.400
There was underpants hanging on the end
of my bed and it weren't even mine.

26:31.011 --> 26:34.033
But... what's the point
of this seriously?

26:46.598 --> 26:51.181
Isn't that a gay term, that? I've heard
that's a gay term, for bomb and bollocks.

26:53.209 --> 26:55.949
I mean... I'm not that bothered. I mean, I know

26:56.069 --> 26:59.694
his house is going to be
nicer than were I am now.

26:59.814 --> 27:01.440
But what am I going to do with him?

27:01.595 --> 27:03.791
Can we just have a game of cards or...?

27:10.110 --> 27:12.828
So glad you decided to stay.
How are you? Come in.

27:13.747 --> 27:15.434
Here in Brazil we have a tradition.

27:15.464 --> 27:18.676
When a friend or someone
come to your place,

27:18.714 --> 27:21.747
this person have
to sleep on your bed.

27:22.952 --> 27:24.969
There's this tradition.
When you receive a friend...

27:24.999 --> 27:26.042
I never heard of this tradition.

27:26.072 --> 27:28.528
Yeah, but this is Brazil.
This is here in Brazil.

27:28.558 --> 27:29.765
Sleep in your bed?

27:29.795 --> 27:31.425
- Yeah.
- I don't want to do that.

27:31.455 --> 27:33.337
But that's... that's the tradition.

27:33.367 --> 27:35.727
Yeah, but I don't know about the
traditions. Just keep it to yourself.

27:35.757 --> 27:37.353
That's what I'm telling you.

27:37.383 --> 27:40.279
That's the way to say that
you're welcome to my place.

27:41.798 --> 27:43.791
This is a lot of *** you're keeping.

27:43.821 --> 27:45.027
Yeah.

27:45.125 --> 27:46.825
And that's where I sleep.

27:48.131 --> 27:49.892
So where are you going to go?

27:50.044 --> 27:51.242
I have to work.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.271
I'll be back late tonight.

27:56.360 --> 28:00.867
When Steve said go and stay I
did expect something different.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.679
I thought it would be a bigger place.

28:05.901 --> 28:08.280
I mean, I hate anything
that's overcrowded.

28:08.496 --> 28:10.214
I can't even think straight.

28:11.564 --> 28:18.983
I mean, for me, popping that or there...
Pop it in the bin. It's just like that, ***

28:19.613 --> 28:22.113
that seems to be his thing in life.
If it's old pop something in it.

28:22.657 --> 28:26.154
That has nothing to do with
anything but... this is mental.

28:27.020 --> 28:30.200
I think it's a tradition that you
should do if you got the room for it.

28:30.812 --> 28:33.501
I don't even like this. I'm just
having it 'cause again I feel guilty.

28:33.531 --> 28:36.901
I'm just doing all stuff to please
a fella who I don't even know.

28:37.141 --> 28:39.728
He doesn't even tell me
why he does that stuff.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.673
Oh, Jesus. What's that?

28:43.789 --> 28:44.789
Here I am.

28:46.089 --> 28:47.111
How are you?

28:48.495 --> 28:49.602
May I sit down?

28:49.632 --> 28:51.480
- Sit down, yeah.
- Excuse me.

28:51.658 --> 28:53.457
Ah, I'm ready to go to job.

28:53.770 --> 28:55.673
This is the last thing
you should know about me.

28:55.703 --> 28:56.909
I'm a female impersonator.

28:56.939 --> 28:58.179
Close your mouth.

29:00.236 --> 29:03.128
As a female impersonator my
name is Lorena Washington.

29:05.082 --> 29:06.383
Why so surprised?

29:06.998 --> 29:08.803
It's just weird. It's weird...

29:09.158 --> 29:10.488
The way I behave, you know...

29:10.518 --> 29:11.709
- I don't...
- No, no.

29:11.739 --> 29:14.967
No, just sort of looking at your hair
and the voice coming out that I know.

29:14.997 --> 29:15.724
Oh yeah?

29:15.754 --> 29:20.215
But... it's like you've had...
Sort of changed the head.

29:21.371 --> 29:23.442
Changed the head.
It's a little bit freaky.

29:23.472 --> 29:24.748
Oh, okay.

29:24.778 --> 29:26.087
Be yourself comfortable.

29:26.117 --> 29:28.298
Be at home. Your home. I'm leaving.

29:28.540 --> 29:29.705
Bye, have a nice night.

29:29.735 --> 29:31.583
I'll see you when you get back.

29:38.452 --> 29:44.013
Is it normal this brazilian tradition
of making everyone feel welcome?

29:46.115 --> 29:50.017
Does that still count when you say I
want you to stay but I'm going out?

29:51.121 --> 29:52.839
I don't see how that counts.

29:57.193 --> 29:59.389
I don't know what's going on out there.

30:01.589 --> 30:03.670
Things like that freak me out.

30:03.700 --> 30:07.233
I wake up in the night with that laughing
at me or something... like Chucky.

30:07.898 --> 30:10.468
I've been in the toilet and
there's a couple of cockroaches.

30:10.498 --> 30:13.680
I know we're Brazil where they're
everywhere, but I don't like them.

30:15.220 --> 30:16.634
I can't see them now.

30:16.719 --> 30:18.492
Don't worry about it.

30:18.522 --> 30:20.502
So he's got two fridges to put place in.

30:20.532 --> 30:23.142
I'm cooking, I'm cooking.
I need the garlic. Where's the garlic?

30:23.172 --> 30:24.870
Is it in that one? That one? No, it's not.

30:24.907 --> 30:26.626
It's down here with
the cockroach next to it.

30:26.652 --> 30:28.196
Look at that down there.

30:29.048 --> 30:34.446
I've heard that cockroaches are like the
thoughest thing that's in the planet.

30:35.048 --> 30:37.016
They say like if there's a nuclear bomb.

30:37.046 --> 30:41.485
They'll... they'll carry on living.
Yet in Salso's kitchen, dead.

30:42.439 --> 30:45.606
It's a bit rude, isn't it, sort of
looking at his house whilst is out.

30:45.636 --> 30:47.131
Well, then again,
he shouldn't be out, should he?

30:47.161 --> 30:48.925
It's his house...
I've said it all there.

30:48.955 --> 30:50.890
It's his house and he's not here.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.749
I don't think we should stay.

30:58.594 --> 31:01.411
Please leave a message and
we will return your call.

31:02.911 --> 31:05.411
Hi, salso, it's Karl.

31:05.836 --> 31:10.235
Uh, we haven't got your cell phone number
so I had to call you at your home number.

31:13.040 --> 31:17.062
Even though we're still here, but we're
about to leave 'cause this is too noisy.

31:17.839 --> 31:23.426
I hope your Friday night was good.
Thanks for having me around.

31:23.456 --> 31:25.736
Honestly, I don't know
why he invited me around.

31:25.766 --> 31:29.745
Cause it's a bit weird, didn't it, that
he gets me around and then he goes out.

31:30.561 --> 31:33.573
The only thing I can think of is, you know,
he lives in quite a rough neighborhood

31:33.603 --> 31:35.675
and he's thinking "oh,
I've got Karl around", you know.

31:35.705 --> 31:38.640
"He can be a bit of security."
It's all I can think of.

31:40.699 --> 31:46.699
I just want to go to a quiet beach
really, get away from it all.

31:49.140 --> 31:51.294
Because it's wearing me out.

32:02.991 --> 32:07.718
It's just have been a full week,
with the carnivale and then the block party

32:07.766 --> 32:10.509
and that late night at Salso's and
stuff. Do you know what I mean?

32:10.539 --> 32:12.735
There's been nothing relaxing about it.

32:15.345 --> 32:19.280
It's not holiday. I thought it was.
That's why I took the job on to be honest.

32:19.637 --> 32:22.936
But, eh... it's a good beach.

32:23.186 --> 32:25.860
The sea is a bit active.
I wouldn't get in there.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.499
Yeah, it would nice.

32:27.529 --> 32:28.769
It's nice enough.

32:30.481 --> 32:33.827
I worry that, you know, if there's more
people turning up it's not that big.

32:33.857 --> 32:35.367
And I don't want to be
here if it's crowded.

32:41.851 --> 32:43.448
Oh, for fuck sake.

32:44.949 --> 32:46.749
Oh, fucking hell.

32:47.446 --> 32:49.425
I can never enjoy anything, can I?

32:50.450 --> 32:53.851
Is that the plan to never let
me just have a normal nice day?

32:54.752 --> 32:58.855
- You've always got a...
- What do you mean?

32:58.885 --> 33:01.559
Well, it's obviously some
nudist beach, isn't it?

33:05.089 --> 33:06.870
You know, I didn't put trunks on, did I?

33:06.900 --> 33:09.840
I'm not going to walk around
with my cock and bollocks out.

33:11.111 --> 33:13.088
It's not even that hot yet.
He's kept his t-shirt on.

33:13.126 --> 33:15.633
But his pants...
little bit hot down there.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.639
Got to whip them off.
A little bending over now for a...

33:21.914 --> 33:24.545
I've never seen anyone
bend over so much as him.

33:28.050 --> 33:29.091
Bloody hell.

33:39.215 --> 33:41.629
- How are you doing?
- I'm all right, yeah.

33:41.989 --> 33:43.057
Not bad.

33:43.087 --> 33:46.304
Okay. But here in this beach you
have to remove your clothes.

33:46.554 --> 33:47.968
Isn't that naturist beach.

33:48.194 --> 33:50.240
What, if I want to stay here
I have to take them off?

33:50.289 --> 33:51.539
Yeah.

33:51.990 --> 33:54.720
- These are the rules.
- Yeah, it's the rules of this beach.

33:58.116 --> 33:59.729
The one that's quite interesting is...

33:59.759 --> 34:02.973
If a male beach goer gets a bit,

34:03.093 --> 34:04.991
sort of excited,

34:05.602 --> 34:08.221
go into the sea, it says,
until he calms down.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.761
But that's embarrassing because
that means everyone knows what's

34:11.791 --> 34:15.857
happening, if you suddenly just run into
the sea and stand there, looking around.

34:15.993 --> 34:19.292
I wonder if these
two women there, it's their

34:19.411 --> 34:21.799
job to be there so
it doesn't happen that much.

34:21.828 --> 34:26.830
It's like a little, you know...
A safety thing to stop it happening.

34:26.909 --> 34:29.520
I haven't seen one fellow run
in there and then look worried.

34:34.784 --> 34:36.850
I've just been going down the beach.

34:37.896 --> 34:40.898
Well, I haven't finished.
It was a nudist beach.

34:43.891 --> 34:45.400
So that's... that's good, isn't it?

34:46.349 --> 34:49.914
You know, I didn't like it.
I was felt a bit uncomfortable there.

34:49.964 --> 34:52.838
An old people stuff is...
Because they're doing it all the time.

34:52.868 --> 34:56.974
It was all like leather. It's not about
being nude and being free and that.

34:57.072 --> 34:58.638
They just don't like wearing pants.

34:58.668 --> 34:59.952
That's the end of it.

34:59.982 --> 35:01.200
They're pants haters.

35:11.414 --> 35:14.654
Yeah, I saw that... at the
carnivale there was an ars on show.

35:37.800 --> 35:43.182
It's not... sky 1 know me,
put that sort of shy ***

35:47.005 --> 35:48.162
so, you know...

35:58.314 --> 36:01.281
I'm going up to the mountain today
to see the Christ the redeemer.

36:01.309 --> 36:03.337
Which is a little bit weird
that they've stuck

36:03.375 --> 36:05.365
it so high up on
a mountain out of the way.

36:05.403 --> 36:07.798
It's almost like the Locas
don't want people to see it.

36:07.828 --> 36:10.459
I mean, on a cloudy day
you can't... it's weird.

36:10.598 --> 36:13.405
Ehm... so anyway I'm just
going up and have a look.

36:13.738 --> 36:16.152
Steve sorted out a woman
to give me a lift.

36:17.941 --> 36:20.565
So yeah, I'm going to have a look
at it, see if it's any good.

36:20.595 --> 36:21.890
You know, I'm here to broaden the mind.

36:21.920 --> 36:25.523
I'll give it a go. I'm not saying it's
gonna be rubbish before I've seen it.

36:25.553 --> 36:28.088
I saw that thing... from a distance,

36:28.118 --> 36:31.393
Jesus, top of the hill, looking like is,
you know, about to bungee jump.

36:31.832 --> 36:35.246
You pass it, you go "there he is,
great, what else are we doing?".

36:35.300 --> 36:37.000
That's enough really for me.

36:40.385 --> 36:42.451
- Karl. Nice to see you too.
- Nice to see you here.

36:42.481 --> 36:44.416
- I'm deloris.
- Deloris? - Yes.

36:44.660 --> 36:47.078
- So... - Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

36:50.404 --> 36:53.144
- I am the driver.
- Yeah, you keep looking there.

36:54.854 --> 36:56.059
Whoops.

36:58.366 --> 37:01.569
- I've just seen the back of Jesus.
- Yes, look what a beautiful.

37:01.599 --> 37:04.462
My beautiful man. The big fellow.

37:04.492 --> 37:06.549
- Oh, beautiful.
- How many stairs?

37:06.579 --> 37:09.379
220, 220 stairs.

37:10.390 --> 37:12.286
- There he is.
- There he is.

37:15.199 --> 37:17.188
Come here, you gonna see it very well.

37:17.218 --> 37:18.979
I will explain you very good.

37:19.345 --> 37:21.111
You are on top of the world, man.

37:21.141 --> 37:23.989
Come, come, come. Because
this is the view, you know.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.665
Look what a beautiful.

37:26.391 --> 37:29.274
And in here... look here, look.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.255
From here with this light behind.

37:31.411 --> 37:32.640
Seems like magic.

37:32.911 --> 37:36.318
Look at the face which is
so delicate, so clean.

37:36.718 --> 37:41.716
The weight of the statue is 1, 145 tons.

37:42.062 --> 37:44.561
Bloody hell. And he's not out there
to punish anybody,

37:44.599 --> 37:47.979
to say... no, it's open arms
blessing the city.

37:50.576 --> 37:51.864
Nice woman and everything.

37:51.894 --> 37:59.195
But, eh... it's that a thing, isn't it,
that she loves it so much... that...

37:59.537 --> 38:02.439
Yeah, I'm not going to change her mind.
You know, I'm not going to come here

38:02.467 --> 38:04.575
and say "you know, it's all right
but it's not that amazing."

38:04.605 --> 38:06.825
It's like telling someone "oh,
the kid's ugly."

38:06.855 --> 38:09.952
Doesn't matter how ugly that kid is,
the mom and dad love it to bits.

38:10.072 --> 38:13.101
And I didn't want to say it
but when I was looking

38:13.130 --> 38:16.087
up I thought the chin looks... a bit big.

38:16.746 --> 38:18.025
It's like that.

38:19.293 --> 38:23.480
All the rest of it is brilliant, the proportions,
his arms and that, his body, but...

38:23.890 --> 38:27.086
They just need to chip away a
bit more I reckon, at the chin.

38:27.172 --> 38:29.194
It's a bit a sort of Jimmi Hillish.

38:32.205 --> 38:35.628
Say if I get back home and someone says
"you've seen Christ the redeemer".

38:35.658 --> 38:37.767
Oh, yeah. Then he go, what's it like?

38:38.995 --> 38:42.104
I would probably just say it's
like... he's like a big arm.

38:42.989 --> 38:45.057
Do you know what
I mean? It's like something

38:45.177 --> 38:47.320
someone would have,
sort of next to the telly.

38:47.846 --> 38:51.341
But I'd say if you gonna come up here,
it's not about that it's about that lot.

38:51.371 --> 38:54.983
***

38:55.013 --> 38:59.160
you still get a crowd coming up here. Just
stick anything there. Stick a caffe there

38:59.190 --> 39:01.896
and people would come up here and
you can charge as much as you like

39:01.926 --> 39:03.977
cause you don't know where
else to go. You're trapped.

39:04.007 --> 39:07.120
You're dying of thirst, charge
about four quid for a can of coke.

39:10.563 --> 39:14.564
The only mistake I made is I said
like he had a chin like Jimmy hill.

39:16.565 --> 39:20.121
And after that, people told me
it's not his chin, it's his beard.

39:20.368 --> 39:22.260
But it didn't look like a beard.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.681
So they could have just done

39:24.801 --> 39:27.714
with chipping a bit more out
to make it look a bit more hairy.

39:29.552 --> 39:32.608
I was saying that they're so many sort of
flying ants out there. I imagine the worker

39:32.636 --> 39:35.265
who's going "oh, I have had enough
of this, does it looks like a beard?".

39:35.307 --> 39:38.620
"Yeah, it does Bob, let's go home.
I'm not hanging around here."

39:38.650 --> 39:41.555
I don't know why there's
so many flying ants there.

39:41.809 --> 39:43.440
Ants shouldn't have wings.

39:43.503 --> 39:46.292
I mean, when you see them walking
they're all over the place.

39:46.322 --> 39:50.043
They sort of go forward and then
come back, take the same path and

39:50.143 --> 39:51.913
shoot off over there
and come back again.

39:51.943 --> 39:55.530
If they're not good at walking they're
going to be useless with wings.

39:56.539 --> 39:59.760
I mean, if I don't like it,
there's no point in me saying

39:59.880 --> 40:01.402
 "oh, it's magnificent..."

40:01.440 --> 40:03.668
Do you know what I mean?
It's just false, isn't it?

40:03.698 --> 40:05.181
And that's what I told Steve.

40:05.211 --> 40:08.829
And he was going "oh, Karl, you're an
idiot, how can't you not be blown away by

40:08.859 --> 40:10.211
the wonder of the world?".

40:11.703 --> 40:13.873
And I said "oh,
I think it was the crowd,

40:13.903 --> 40:16.284
I didn't enjoy it because of
all the people up there", so...

40:16.558 --> 40:19.074
He sorted me out
a helicopter ride to see it from above

40:19.112 --> 40:20.960
and said that would blow me away.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.696
So, have you ever been in a helicopter?

40:22.726 --> 40:24.487
No, I haven't done it before.

40:25.126 --> 40:29.385
It's just a little bit,
you know, nervous about it.

40:29.505 --> 40:31.655
It's just if you got no chance,
have you, if it goes wrong

40:31.693 --> 40:33.685
it's not like a plane
that glides. It just drops.

40:33.735 --> 40:36.496
It's almost... it shouldn't
been in the air really.

40:36.548 --> 40:38.836
Should have left a message
for Suzanne really, but...

40:38.866 --> 40:41.801
- Do you want to say a quick word?
- No, I'll leave it.

40:44.363 --> 40:46.880
She gets a load of money anyway,
doesn't he, if it all goes wrong?

40:51.381 --> 40:52.381
Oh, God.

41:07.164 --> 41:09.109
There he is.

41:09.139 --> 41:10.596
There's the big Jesus.

41:13.540 --> 41:15.388
Sneaking around the back of it.

41:27.785 --> 41:29.776
Brilliant. Love that.

41:33.929 --> 41:37.340
I've always kind of thought people with
money who buy one, they sort of go

41:37.370 --> 41:40.063
absolutely not bad.
What do you need one of them for?

41:40.093 --> 41:42.767
It was definitely the best
way to get about that.

41:42.809 --> 41:45.276
I mean the landings are
a little bit like "oh, God"...

41:45.314 --> 41:46.985
and I wasn't really enjoying seeing

41:47.003 --> 41:50.916
the wonder at the time because I'm like
thinking am I going to land and all that.

41:50.946 --> 41:52.620
But it's... it's brilliant.

41:52.897 --> 41:55.137
Best day... I... I... I can go home now.

42:05.821 --> 42:08.538
I just thought you meant when
you said the helicopter,

42:08.568 --> 42:10.504
I just sort of enjoyed it, that's all.

42:10.708 --> 42:13.252
Yeah and the Jesus thing
is all right as well.

42:22.053 --> 42:24.234
<i>next time on an idiot abroad.</i>

42:24.298 --> 42:26.407
- Machu Picchu
- get out of the way.

42:26.989 --> 42:30.775
It's accessible by eleven hour track,
through the maintenance.

42:30.805 --> 42:33.132
Well, that's not so
accessible, isn't it?

42:33.212 --> 42:34.552
That's true.

42:36.096 --> 42:38.788
I'm not getting on this.
Why is he landing on water?

42:38.816 --> 42:41.270
There isn't enough land here,
chop some of the trees down.

42:41.300 --> 42:43.765
Oh, fucking hell!

42:44.837 --> 42:48.555
It's going to the end of the day.
I've got to try to sleep in the jungle.

42:49.976 --> 42:53.810
Fuck. Fucking hell!

42:54.060 --> 42:56.821
You're not meant to laugh,
you're meant to go whoo!

42:57.230 --> 43:01.501
There's no way... anyone who'll be watching
this is going "that looks pleasant."

43:01.751 --> 43:05.851
Healthy? Healthy going that?
Definitly not.
