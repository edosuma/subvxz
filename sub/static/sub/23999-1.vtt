00:38.706 --> 00:44.812
What's up, everybody,
and welcome to the very
last episode of our vlog.

00:44.845 --> 00:48.316
We have Sarah, Hannah,
Hannah's driving.
Say hello, Hannah.

00:48.349 --> 00:51.352
Hello, Hannah.
We started this a long time ago.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.122
We basically just wanted to help
people who couldn't find it
for themselves.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.757
But this is our last entry.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.727
That's very true.
That is because
I am leaving the country

00:59.760 --> 01:01.495
to do some traveling
at the end of the month,

01:01.529 --> 01:05.733
and Hannah is joining
the United States Marine Corps.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.701
But that does not mean
we can lose focus.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.770
We are on a mission,
we have a goal.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.605
We're losing our minds
in this car.

01:11.639 --> 01:15.176
It's been a long ride,
been asking a lot of
personal questions.

01:15.209 --> 01:19.447
What you heard in a previous
installment was a letter
from a man named Mark.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.750
Now, Mark, he comes
from Hope County, Montana.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.185
That's where we are right now.

01:24.218 --> 01:27.688
All the beautiful, well,
cows and everything.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.490
It's actually very pretty.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.859
But he is accusing
a group called Eden's Gate,

01:31.892 --> 01:36.597
of taking control of his town
and taking people
against their will.

01:36.630 --> 01:37.631
Doesn't sound legal.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.400
It's true.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.335
A number of people have gone
missing in Hope County recently,

01:41.369 --> 01:44.638
but that does not mean
that Eden's Gate
is abducting people.

01:44.672 --> 01:47.475
It doesn't mean
they're not abducting people.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.643
Either way,
I think there's
a lot more to this story.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.313
Police have told them that
there's nothing to investigate.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.381
That's where we come in.

01:53.414 --> 01:56.384
That's where we come in.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.419
We're on our way to see Mark,

01:58.452 --> 02:01.689
and we're gonna go try to see
if we can find the evidence
that he's looking for.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.758
And if we do, you guys
will be the first to know.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.460

stick around, subscribe,

02:06.494 --> 02:09.597

as we shoot it. Bye.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.863
Good, right?
They're into local brewery
called Whistling Beaver.

02:42.896 --> 02:48.202
They started serving it a while
back before everything changed.

02:48.236 --> 02:52.373
All right, so, you made
a lot of accusations about
this group, Eden's Gate.

02:52.406 --> 02:57.545
All true.
They've been taking people,
including my sister Lenny.

02:57.578 --> 03:02.716
Are you saying Eden's Gate
kidnapped your sister
and the police did shit?

03:02.750 --> 03:06.320
Well, she left on
her own accord.

03:06.354 --> 03:10.691
But she's been spending
all sorts of time with this
man named John Seed.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.560
The Seed family run the Peggies.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.428
ALEX: The Peggies?

03:14.462 --> 03:18.332
MARK:
Hey, that's what we call 'em.
The Project Eden's Gate. P-E-G.

03:18.366 --> 03:21.235
One day, she comes home,
packs her bags and takes off.

03:21.269 --> 03:25.839
I called her,
finally get her on the phone,
she was not acting herself.

03:25.873 --> 03:31.912
Kept talking about some
man named Joseph, the one
I told you about? Father.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.615
Is it possible
she just got religion?

03:34.648 --> 03:37.518
I know my sister, okay?

03:37.551 --> 03:42.022
But when I talk
to her on the phone,
zero energy, zero life.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.292
It was just zapped out of her.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.594
Question is, what do they want?

03:46.627 --> 03:49.297
MARK: They're saying that
the world is coming to an end.

03:49.330 --> 03:53.667
They're preparing for it.
For the end of time.
Do you believe that?

04:02.643 --> 04:05.546
ALEX: Good. Yeah.
Okay.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.816

his sermon, at the Tala Ranch.

at Eden's Gate.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.289
Perfect. We're good.

Is the light on?
Do you see the light?
No.

How does it look?
No, looks good.

because you are scared.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.817
Scared because of what
you see on the news,
and what you hear on the radio.

Deception. Divisiveness.
Godlessness.

Who is accountable?

04:55.496 --> 04:57.831
But there is an answer
to that fear.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.370
And that answer has a name.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.340

is Joseph Seed!

I want you to all
close your eyes for a moment.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.583
And I want you to think about
the world outside this tent.

05:52.152 --> 05:55.155
And as you sit there alone
in your personal darkness,

05:55.188 --> 06:01.562
can you see how sick
our society has become?

06:01.595 --> 06:05.533
Can you picture disease
creepin' across the land?

06:07.435 --> 06:11.672
Greed. War. Starvation.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.643
Because people have
turned away from God.

churning in our guts.
