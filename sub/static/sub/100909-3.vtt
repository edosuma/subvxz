WEBVTT

00:09.240 --> 00:14.230
The blood of the innocent is
shed to enrich the powerful.

00:16.260 --> 00:20.070
It is and always has been a war.

00:21.260 --> 00:24.250
See what we just received.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.260
What is it? Mass
grave outside Tripoli.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.080
According to whom?

00:37.120 --> 00:42.170
According to the one who
risked his life to send it to us.

00:44.070 --> 00:45.150
Butcher Gaddafi.

00:45.190 --> 00:51.110
Maybe he will eventually
be deserved. Put it online.

00:56.260 --> 01:02.020
We Americans have some basic
values ​​that guide our strategy.

01:02.060 --> 01:08.030
As I said, we strongly condemn
the use of violence in Libya.

01:09.090 --> 01:15.090
In our day, wars can be fought
both with money and with weapons.

01:15.130 --> 01:21.040
The victims of war no longer
fall only on the battlefield.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.260
But also at home.

01:30.090 --> 01:34.040
From now on, I'll take care of you.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.020
It is enough.

01:39.250 --> 01:42.100
Do you really think she was murdered?

01:47.060 --> 01:52.150
We only perform an autopsy if
there is a suspicion of murder.

01:53.060 --> 01:56.160
Can you see if someone
has given her an overdose?

01:58.200 --> 02:04.170
Yes. Or she has taken an
overdose on purpose or accidentally.

02:04.210 --> 02:08.120
I'm sorry,
but it's impossible to prove.

02:11.210 --> 02:16.240
I didn't think you were like them,
but you were better.

02:17.030 --> 02:19.260
Clean me up! I feel
better without you.

03:04.020 --> 03:07.080
Pay attention to the gap
between train and platform.

03:26.210 --> 03:29.040
Watch out! Sorry.

03:32.110 --> 03:33.210
Hey. Hey.

03:33.250 --> 03:37.130
There should be an
admission card. It's the first day.

03:37.170 --> 03:41.060
Name? Oliver. Harris.

03:41.100 --> 03:43.090
Yes.

03:43.130 --> 03:45.030
PARTOUT SHORT

03:47.040 --> 03:50.080
Here you go. Sorry. Thanks.

04:00.160 --> 04:03.250
By acting like China
did several years ago...

04:10.230 --> 04:14.230
What are you doing here?
Massimo offered me a job.

04:15.020 --> 04:17.110
Congratulations. Take my table.

04:17.149 --> 04:21.140
Always be vigilant.

04:24.150 --> 04:28.030
So for Satan... Now it is.

04:31.060 --> 04:34.250
See you. Have a good time,
you old man.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.230
Yes...

04:37.230 --> 04:43.030
You should know that I look
forward to being part of the team.

04:45.060 --> 04:46.190
Coffee?

04:58.180 --> 05:02.030
Oliver Harris signs up for service.

05:11.250 --> 05:17.230
Dishonest, corrupt, greedy.
It's something they shout for us.

05:18.020 --> 05:22.090
And it has only gotten
worse since the crisis in 2008.

05:22.130 --> 05:27.220
Despite the banking sector
helping billions achieve their dreams.

05:28.200 --> 05:32.030
Too many see only the worst in us.

05:33.030 --> 05:39.190
But today we pay homage
to... the best in you.

05:42.120 --> 05:46.240
The life of our friend and
colleague Edward Stuart.

05:53.230 --> 05:56.200
See you in the office.

06:05.230 --> 06:10.040
Dominic told about
Carrie. It really hurts me.

06:14.020 --> 06:17.120
I am worried for you. I'm alright.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.080
Whatever you think, Dominic is right.

06:20.120 --> 06:24.190
If you take revenge on the bank,
you only hurt yourself.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.070
Excuse me.

06:36.170 --> 06:40.260
Commissioner Victoria Bale.
My partner's assistant Winks.

06:41.050 --> 06:43.220
Do cops go to funerals?

06:43.260 --> 06:48.080
A friend who had mafia cases said they
were showing the relationship of power.

06:48.120 --> 06:53.130
They are difficult to place. Did you and
the deceased compete for the same job?

06:54.130 --> 06:56.070
Is this going to happen here?

06:56.110 --> 07:01.070
We will establish his state of mind.
We know nothing about his last moments.

07:01.110 --> 07:05.220
Mr. Stuart jumped out somewhere
with no surveillance cameras.

07:05.260 --> 07:11.090
Mr. Ruggero? Mr. Morgan
wants to talk to you.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.210
We can continue in the office.

07:30.070 --> 07:37.040
We have lost so many. First John,
then Ed and now Carrie...

07:38.170 --> 07:41.210
I am sorry. Who told you that?

07:42.210 --> 07:46.110
It is hard to place blame
when someone dies.

07:46.150 --> 07:50.160
Was it your fault because you
destroyed the Davenport deal?

07:50.200 --> 07:54.130
Or mine,
because I didn't see Ed's scam.

07:54.170 --> 08:00.060
Let go of the dead. Otherwise,
it eats you up from the inside.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.120
Like with Nina.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.170
Demand for reforms
in the Arab countries

08:15.210 --> 08:20.140
broke out in a light hat in the
dictatorial state of Libya today.

08:20.180 --> 08:24.210
After 41 years in power,
Muammar Gaddafi has...

08:26.090 --> 08:32.159
We waited forever. I
laughed at the journalist.

08:34.100 --> 08:37.070
Sorry. The timing is bad.

08:39.140 --> 08:44.190
How did you find out about Ed Stuart?
Well, are you patting yourself now?

08:44.230 --> 08:47.040
My wife is dead.

08:48.200 --> 08:52.230
Because of this bank. What ...?

09:02.260 --> 09:08.250
No, nothing yet. Harris,
yes. With two Rs.

09:13.170 --> 09:16.210
I do not always defend Massimo.

09:16.250 --> 09:21.050
He had to fire Paul. That's not true.

09:21.090 --> 09:24.050
Was it okay for Paul to go behind us?

09:24.090 --> 09:28.210
It's not that simple. Or
you just love to discuss.

09:28.250 --> 09:33.230
It's fun to excite you. Also
when you always lose weight?

09:36.030 --> 09:40.040
Paul betrayed Massimo.
And us. Full stop.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.080
So what? Why are you sitting there?

09:43.120 --> 09:48.120
Paul said... He was a
trader. You're an apprentice.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.260
You sit...

09:52.220 --> 09:54.050
over there.

09:56.240 --> 10:03.130
Okay. I am very sorry. Should
the new one be truncated today?

10:03.170 --> 10:07.030
No more than Massimo taunted you.

10:16.120 --> 10:20.160
Assange describes WikiLeaks
as "an uncensored system

10:20.200 --> 10:23.110
for mass leaks of documents ".

10:23.150 --> 10:26.120
Their organization
is more specialized.

10:26.160 --> 10:30.170
Maybe. Subterranea
does not leak information

10:30.210 --> 10:36.090
about war, political corruption
or "murder of civilians".

10:36.130 --> 10:39.160
Our background is the financial world.

10:39.200 --> 10:45.030
Investment banks, IMF, rating
agencies, hedge fund managers...

10:45.070 --> 10:48.110
Those who have made
themselves the new gods

10:48.150 --> 10:53.200
and who doesn't care about
small things like democracy.

10:53.240 --> 10:57.250
Her name was Carrie
Ruggero. Do not know her.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.080
Are you sure? Yes.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.050
Okay.

11:04.090 --> 11:07.200
Maybe she used an alias. Not here.

11:17.130 --> 11:24.060
I was at all three escort agencies.
No one recognized Carrie.

11:26.040 --> 11:30.220
Unless they lied.
Why should they do it?

11:32.100 --> 11:35.220
I do not know. She was a drug addict.

11:35.260 --> 11:40.100
No one is to blame,
not at all the one who loved her.

11:43.040 --> 11:46.200
I can stay and sleep if you want.

11:51.020 --> 11:56.200
I want to be alone.
Is it okay? Of course.

12:01.210 --> 12:03.090
Good night.

12:10.080 --> 12:13.190
How about Ruggero? I'm
waiting for the right moment.

12:13.230 --> 12:16.140
That was,
as soon as you got the order.

12:16.180 --> 12:20.080
His wife is dead. Remember
who you are dealing with.

12:20.120 --> 12:26.110
A shark. If he is momentarily
weakened, we should strike.

12:26.150 --> 12:29.140
I know. I think... Sofia!

12:29.180 --> 12:33.200
He does not process
emotions just like the rest of us.

12:33.240 --> 12:36.080
No, I just thought...

12:37.260 --> 12:41.040
Okay. I'll take care of it.

12:57.030 --> 13:00.120
It hurts me incredibly with your wife.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.060
Thanks.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.240
I don't feel like company.

13:07.030 --> 13:10.230
Do you think her and Ed
Stuart's death are related?

13:13.210 --> 13:16.130
I think I know why he died.

13:23.060 --> 13:27.020
Have you seen this? I also see news.

13:27.060 --> 13:30.190
Maybe Gaddafi is not
behind the massacre.

13:30.230 --> 13:34.230
Then who? LIA is Libya's state fund.

13:35.020 --> 13:40.060
Gaddafi's bank account. We have
intercepted hundreds of emails.

13:41.190 --> 13:47.190
Finance chief Samir Al Maghrabi
may have been bribed by...

13:50.040 --> 13:53.100
New York London Investment Bank.

13:58.260 --> 14:01.180
They are making a deal.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.110
Which one? We dont know.

14:06.150 --> 14:10.080
But we know the name of
Al Maghrabi's contact person.

14:11.130 --> 14:15.050
Your boss, Dominic Morgan.

14:16.260 --> 14:20.090
Dominic is many things,
but hardly a warlord.

14:20.130 --> 14:24.030
You're not ready. I don't
believe in conspiracies.

14:24.070 --> 14:28.070
Dominic operates in higher air
strata than mass graves in Libya.

14:28.110 --> 14:34.090
LIA manages $ 70 billion.
Is that high enough for you?

14:38.060 --> 14:41.210
Sofia... Ed Stuart was part of it.

14:41.250 --> 14:47.020
But he couldn't live with
blood on his hands. Can you?

14:49.110 --> 14:50.240
It proves nothing.

14:51.030 --> 14:55.110
There is talk of an important meeting
between Al Maghrabi and Morgan

14:55.150 --> 14:57.110
In London Tomorrow night.

14:58.250 --> 15:01.120
There we find the evidence.

15:04.170 --> 15:07.070
Let's say you're right...

15:08.260 --> 15:11.170
But where does Carrie
come into the picture?

15:15.170 --> 15:17.180
She was a smoke veil.

15:19.200 --> 15:24.050
She had to divert the one who
had enough power and access

15:24.090 --> 15:28.140
to find out what Ed had
messed himself up with.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.190
You.

15:33.230 --> 15:38.070
It hurts me,
Massimo. The clock is many.

15:53.020 --> 15:56.230
Our role is to shine in the dark.

15:57.020 --> 16:01.120
If you don't like the sight, you
have the power to change the world.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.210
You just have to believe that you can.

16:03.250 --> 16:07.200
Isn't it ironic to shine in the dark

16:07.240 --> 16:11.260
may you be part of the
shadows and darkness yourself?

16:12.050 --> 16:16.020
You must understand that the
organizations that we are fighting

16:16.060 --> 16:19.110
protect their secrets by all means.

16:19.150 --> 16:23.120
Chelsea Manning was arrested
for breaking American law.

16:23.160 --> 16:26.130
Are you sure your sources are safe?

16:26.170 --> 16:31.130
Our contributors and
supporters are not at risk.

16:32.090 --> 16:34.230
Yes.

16:37.140 --> 16:39.020
Rebellion In Libya...

16:39.060 --> 16:43.050
Latest news on financial sector...

16:50.050 --> 16:52.170
What do we have at LIA and NYL?

16:52.210 --> 16:57.110
All LIA assets are
on the restriction list.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.230
Restriction List?

17:00.020 --> 17:04.020
We are supposed to have insider knowledge
and are not allowed to trade them.

17:04.060 --> 17:08.030
Dominic arranges a meeting
with some highly liquid customers.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.130
Where? I do not know.

17:10.170 --> 17:16.069
A hotel, a club... a private
place. They don't want attention.

17:16.109 --> 17:21.119
Funding an evil dictator does
not exactly benefit one's reputation.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.020
Bed Paul...

17:24.060 --> 17:28.240
Jason or someone... about
shorting them on the list.

17:29.030 --> 17:32.140
Didn't you just say
they shouldn't be traded?

17:32.180 --> 17:35.110
Are you banking
supervision? I can't understand.

17:35.150 --> 17:40.150
When the shares are put on the market,
prices fall.

17:40.190 --> 17:45.070
We get a head start by
shorting the shares in a dark pool.

17:45.110 --> 17:48.250
In a dark pool, shares are
traded without market knowledge.

17:49.040 --> 17:53.070
We buy them back
cheap and score the box.

17:53.110 --> 17:58.250
But I do not understand this
with LIA. Surely it is just a spin?

18:01.170 --> 18:06.050
This is perhaps why Ed Stuart
would not be deputy director.

18:10.180 --> 18:13.030
The reason he was murdered.

18:13.070 --> 18:16.120
How do you know
Dominic is working with LIA?

18:17.140 --> 18:19.220
It's a long story. Why?

18:20.150 --> 18:24.170
It may happen, but when I
asked about Carrie yesterday

18:24.210 --> 18:29.180
said an agency that Dominic
ordered 20 girls for tonight.

18:30.230 --> 18:33.100
Where? I can check.

18:33.140 --> 18:36.070
Do it. Thanks.

18:42.150 --> 18:46.040
Why don't you just go to the police?

18:46.080 --> 18:51.090
And tell them Ed Stuart died
because of a file with my name?

18:51.130 --> 18:54.230
On a laptop, we stole. I stole.

18:55.220 --> 19:01.040
Do not worry. If they suspect anyone,
it's me.

19:12.190 --> 19:16.170
We will meet again. By
agreement with your secretary.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.050
Is this your team? Yes.

19:21.090 --> 19:24.220
Kalim Chowdhrey,
Eleanor Bourg and Paul McGinnan?

19:24.260 --> 19:32.180
No, that's Kalim and Eleanor.
Paul is no longer working here.

19:32.220 --> 19:34.140
It comes suddenly.

19:34.180 --> 19:38.240
He wanted to try something
new. Who is he there?

19:39.030 --> 19:44.040
Oliver Harris. So young.
Does he earn more than me?

19:44.080 --> 19:46.160
Depressing. Safe.

19:46.200 --> 19:50.030
Do you know if Oliver was
with mr. Stuart the other day?

19:50.070 --> 19:51.250
I doubt it.

19:52.040 --> 19:56.170
A young man, similar to him, was
there two days after Stuart's death.

19:57.110 --> 20:03.080
Oliver Harris started here
Yesterday. It was hardly him.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.150
Probably just a coincidence.

20:05.190 --> 20:10.230
Should we continue in my
office? We have no more.

20:11.020 --> 20:14.180
Unless there's something
you want to talk about?

20:15.160 --> 20:20.040
Thank you for your time.
No reason. Goodbye.

20:37.080 --> 20:41.020
Where is the dinner
held? A hotel in London.

20:41.060 --> 20:43.040
You must join.

20:44.090 --> 20:47.070
Officially, I know nothing about it.

20:48.090 --> 20:52.230
Are you sure Maghrabi is
coming? You saw the email.

20:54.070 --> 20:55.160
Who is your source?

20:57.200 --> 20:59.180
A lady does not gossip.

21:08.150 --> 21:10.130
Are you okay?

21:14.120 --> 21:18.040
I am going aswell. Nope.
You must not be jeopardized.

21:18.080 --> 21:22.020
I decide for myself what to bring you,
please.

21:23.050 --> 21:26.020
Do not worry. I'm not a lady.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.260
Escort agency.

21:39.150 --> 21:43.210
If Gaddafi falls, is it so good
or bad for the United States?

21:47.220 --> 21:51.110
I get breakfast. I'm Hank Marvin.

21:51.150 --> 21:55.090
What? Hank Marvin... "starvin '"...

21:55.130 --> 22:00.080
You want something? Look
around. What do you see?

22:05.150 --> 22:07.230
Never leave the camp. Received.

22:09.170 --> 22:14.060
We make an exception
if I get a triple latte.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.240
Okay. And you?

22:17.080 --> 22:19.180
Cool.

22:22.170 --> 22:26.160
What is it? You can
only make one giant roar.

22:26.200 --> 22:31.240
If he is wrong about Libya,
it will be our giant roar.

22:32.030 --> 22:37.050
What's the problem? To short
LIA is classic Max Ruggero.

22:37.090 --> 22:41.160
Max researches for months
before choosing a position.

22:41.200 --> 22:45.070
He probably got a tip.
Or he doesn't think clearly.

22:45.110 --> 22:50.180
He feels guilt over Carrie and
wants to hit Dominic and the bank.

22:50.220 --> 22:55.180
Imagine Dominic Morgan's
anger directed at us!

23:01.130 --> 23:04.110
Hey. A triple latte, please.

23:04.150 --> 23:07.030
Here you go. Thanks. See ya.

23:13.250 --> 23:16.210
Mr. Harris? I'm busy.

23:18.170 --> 23:22.090
I saw you talking to my boss.

23:22.260 --> 23:25.140
They took Ed Stuart's laptop.

23:26.150 --> 23:28.070
Excuse me?

23:28.110 --> 23:30.130
Why do you think ...?

23:30.170 --> 23:35.140
Did Massimo say that?
Relax. We're not looking for you.

23:35.180 --> 23:40.070
I know nothing about any laptop.

23:40.260 --> 23:47.170
Is that your official explanation?
Should I get a lawyer?

23:47.210 --> 23:51.090
You know that. Lying
to the police is serious.

23:53.020 --> 23:55.120
Sleep on it.

23:59.250 --> 24:01.210
Get by at 9th

24:09.250 --> 24:13.070
Syncing camera...

24:13.110 --> 24:14.190
Sync done

24:15.090 --> 24:17.100
Okay...

24:19.030 --> 24:20.210
Thanks.

24:25.180 --> 24:30.240
You said the agency sent
twenty girls. I'm just one more.

24:31.030 --> 24:33.170
The camera can be tracked.

24:34.210 --> 24:38.080
Don't want to know
what they're doing? Jo.

24:38.120 --> 24:43.120
I cut up Al Maghrabi's
connection to NYL and sneak out.

24:45.020 --> 24:47.070
Her name is Jana.

24:51.070 --> 24:54.070
Hi, Jana,
Niclas from Butterfly Escorts.

24:54.110 --> 25:00.260
Unfortunately, tonight is canceled.
You know how bankers are.

25:01.260 --> 25:07.170
Next time they have to
pay double. Thank you.

25:08.210 --> 25:12.060
Is there anything you
don't tell about your past?

25:13.100 --> 25:15.060
Be careful.

25:28.060 --> 25:31.100
Name? Sign here.

25:31.140 --> 25:34.180
Has everyone signed
the discretion agreement?

25:43.160 --> 25:45.070
Thanks.

25:47.130 --> 25:51.040
Don't worry... Jana. It will be OK.

25:52.070 --> 25:56.150
If the customer invites you up,
it's up to you.

25:56.190 --> 25:59.180
But there is a bonus
to those who say yes.

25:59.220 --> 26:02.130
Is there something
you don't understand?

26:02.170 --> 26:05.090
You get your mobiles as you go.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.230
It was everything. Have fun!

27:18.220 --> 27:23.240
Oh boy! Excuse me.
Habibi... where are you from?

27:24.220 --> 27:27.040
Nowhere. All locations.

27:27.080 --> 27:32.230
That's no answer. I know,
so... try to guess.

27:33.020 --> 27:34.210
Wanna play?

27:34.250 --> 27:40.040
Then we say... Wait a minute.
Hold it here for one minute.

27:40.080 --> 27:46.200
Okay. A minute. I count. One, two...

27:47.200 --> 27:49.090
three...

28:15.030 --> 28:16.170
What do you want in there?

28:18.170 --> 28:21.230
I'm with my date. Samir Al Maghrabi.

28:24.080 --> 28:27.240
Where is he? He picks up champagne.

28:31.050 --> 28:36.020
Came. We need a talk.
Are you kidding me? I...

28:36.060 --> 28:37.210
There you are!

28:39.020 --> 28:42.060
A minute. Do you know her,
mr. Maghrabi?

28:42.100 --> 28:46.250
Of course. She obviously
thinks I'm a servant.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.130
Excuse us. Pleasant evening.

28:49.170 --> 28:51.160
Goodbye. Thank you.

28:59.220 --> 29:04.080
Tyrone smelled of
alcohol when I got home.

29:04.120 --> 29:07.070
He must have been
drinking with his slingshot.

29:07.110 --> 29:11.070
And smoked. His eyes were bloodshot.

29:11.110 --> 29:14.250
He's only 14! That's some shit.

29:16.200 --> 29:22.060
"You're the best, Latoyah. You
always look after my little brother."

29:22.100 --> 29:27.170
What?

29:27.210 --> 29:31.120
Do I have your attention now? Soon.

29:35.110 --> 29:37.020
Is it the laptop?

29:37.060 --> 29:41.220
I'll talk to the police tomorrow.
I don't know what to say.

29:41.260 --> 29:45.110
Tell the truth. Also?

29:45.150 --> 29:50.070
I'll never get the chance
again... to get us out of here.

29:50.110 --> 29:55.130
Guys like Massimo only go up
in money and to robbing people.

29:55.170 --> 30:01.060
If you do not get robbed this time,
it will be next time.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.240
No more talk.

30:17.100 --> 30:22.160
Their presence tonight
is crucial to our success.

30:22.200 --> 30:25.240
I have a club at Pall Mall...

30:29.070 --> 30:33.140
No more work. Now we have to play.

30:41.220 --> 30:43.050
I want to fuck you.

30:45.180 --> 30:49.180
I fuck you like nobody
fucked you before.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.140
Wait. Here.

31:03.180 --> 31:06.100
Do you want to play again? Yes.

31:12.260 --> 31:14.180
You too.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.190
Just shut up, hell!

31:45.120 --> 31:47.190
What happened?

31:50.090 --> 31:56.030
Do you know him? The
guy here. Yes. Chris Bailey.

31:56.070 --> 32:00.160
He took over from Ed Stuart and
is about to become deputy director.

32:00.200 --> 32:04.020
He said something
about Pall Mall. The Club?

32:04.060 --> 32:08.110
Maybe. I have to clean the
sound at home on my computer.

32:08.150 --> 32:11.160
Maybe Dominic sells LIA shares there.

32:11.200 --> 32:15.130
Leak the pictures before he does. Why?

32:15.170 --> 32:18.220
They prove the connection
between the NYL and the Libyans.

32:18.260 --> 32:21.230
No,
only that they were sown for a party.

32:22.020 --> 32:25.090
After the Tripoli
massacre? That's plenty.

32:26.040 --> 32:30.230
Post the pictures
on the website. Okay.

32:42.240 --> 32:46.180
Stop. Stop looking at me like that.

32:49.090 --> 32:57.090
I'm fine.

33:08.140 --> 33:10.260
I am coming!

33:38.110 --> 33:41.160
Don't say he has
resigned after three days.

33:48.100 --> 33:53.090
If you want to deal with money, you
have to learn how to deal with pain.

33:53.130 --> 33:57.080
Buy a nicer tie. That... offends me.

33:59.230 --> 34:02.070
Appointment. That was all.

34:06.210 --> 34:10.070
I'll be with the police in an hour.

34:11.230 --> 34:16.170
They will ask me about Ed
Stuart's laptop. They know I took it.

34:18.090 --> 34:22.260
How? Have you talked to anyone?
The woman who gave it to me.

34:24.170 --> 34:26.159
Nina gave them nothing.

34:26.199 --> 34:31.080
Someone must have seen me. How
else do they know what I look like?

34:33.179 --> 34:36.030
I knew it was wrong.

34:36.070 --> 34:38.239
They don't aim me
if I speak the truth.

34:39.030 --> 34:43.139
Listen,
they want to hit me through you.

34:43.179 --> 34:45.250
Where's the laptop now?

34:55.199 --> 34:57.100
Okay.

34:58.230 --> 35:05.090
What should I say to
them? Do what feels right.

35:28.250 --> 35:33.020
I've been looking for you!
We're on the move. So what?

35:33.060 --> 35:36.130
Didn't you get the Al
Maghrabi pictures? Jo.

35:36.170 --> 35:40.070
The bank will meet with
LIA investors this morning.

35:40.110 --> 35:42.200
Ruggero asked me to put them up.

35:42.240 --> 35:47.070
It is not conclusive evidence,
but the mention will be enough for...

35:47.110 --> 35:52.250
- to stop Morgan,
right? You're too keen, Sofia.

35:53.040 --> 35:56.200
If it fails,
our credibility is smoking.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.220
Am I too eager?

35:58.260 --> 36:01.230
Or are you too fearful?

36:06.170 --> 36:10.220
I know it's personal
to you so I overhear it.

36:10.260 --> 36:15.100
But I spend precious
time cooling you off.

36:16.180 --> 36:20.030
I have come a long way with Massimo.

36:20.070 --> 36:22.250
The pictures we give him trust in me.

36:23.040 --> 36:26.090
We strike when I say.

36:26.130 --> 36:31.240
Keep your eyes on the target.
Personal revenge must wait.

36:35.070 --> 36:38.230
Turn this off, please.

36:39.020 --> 36:42.040
Which way? This way?

36:45.160 --> 36:48.150
A club at Pall Mall...

37:04.090 --> 37:07.200
The Guardian. Hilary Mason, thank you.

37:21.160 --> 37:24.170
Good morning,
mr. Harris. Good morning.

37:28.050 --> 37:32.080
Inquiry started at 9.04.
Bale and Winks present.

37:32.120 --> 37:35.260
Did you think about
our question yesterday?

37:37.170 --> 37:40.040
Yes... yes, I have.

37:40.080 --> 37:43.200
Did you take the laptop
from Ed Stuart's house?

37:45.030 --> 37:48.260
Sorry, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:49.050 --> 37:54.030
The housekeeper can identify
you. She saw you from the window.

37:54.210 --> 37:59.080
She must be wrong. I have
never visited Edward Stuart.

38:00.110 --> 38:06.140
I understand. The dream job... Ruggero
is the ticket to a better life.

38:07.230 --> 38:13.260
But if you mean, you just become
another street boy behind bars.

38:16.060 --> 38:20.050
I have answered the
question. Can I leave now?

38:23.240 --> 38:27.090
The hearing ended at 1 p.m. 9.06.

38:56.180 --> 38:59.090
Thank you for coming on time.

38:59.130 --> 39:03.080
It was a late night and a
long night for some of you.

39:03.120 --> 39:09.120
We will continue with the
details of the sale, but first...

39:09.160 --> 39:14.230
Chris will tell you a little more
about the fund's background.

39:15.200 --> 39:19.220
As you know, the Libyan Investment
Authority was established in 2006

39:19.260 --> 39:23.260
to generate a wide range
of revenue for future...

39:24.050 --> 39:28.050
So what? The
Guardian just put this up.

39:28.090 --> 39:32.120
They are from last night.
Someone sneaked in.

39:33.170 --> 39:37.100
Who is the journalist? Hilary Mason.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.260
Mr. Morgan,
would you like to pronounce you?

39:49.150 --> 39:53.070
NYL boss Dominic Morgan
will not comment on photos

39:53.110 --> 39:56.150
which suggests a connection to Gaddafi

39:56.190 --> 40:01.060
The dictator of Libya, who has killed
thousands of his own countrymen.

40:01.100 --> 40:04.160
The bank's share
has just fallen by 10%.

40:04.200 --> 40:07.200
I love to see my pay scented.

40:07.240 --> 40:13.210
How much do you know about this?
I hope you know what you're doing.

40:17.030 --> 40:20.080
This does not entice us. Nor us.

40:20.120 --> 40:24.100
A connection to
Gaddafi is... not optimal!

40:24.140 --> 40:27.240
I'll take care of it. Immediately.

40:29.130 --> 40:31.150
Thanks, Janet. See you.

40:32.230 --> 40:35.020
Hi! What the hell are you doing?

40:35.060 --> 40:37.230
You wanted the story out, after all.

40:38.020 --> 40:40.210
On Subterranea's website.
Not in the newspaper!

40:40.250 --> 40:43.180
The truth, then,
is the most important thing.

40:43.220 --> 40:47.180
Dominic knows I should
meet Mason. He's not stupid.

40:47.220 --> 40:50.260
You got what I promised.
A fucking headache.

40:51.050 --> 40:56.220
No, you've got evidence that
NYL drove a man to suicide.

40:56.260 --> 41:01.060
I have to run. Massimo? Massimo!

41:02.230 --> 41:06.160
What now? Dominic
holds press conference.

41:06.200 --> 41:09.170
Good morning. Thank you for coming.

41:12.140 --> 41:17.090
The rumors and charges of the
press are very upsetting to me

41:17.130 --> 41:19.060
the bank and my family.

41:21.140 --> 41:25.210
We do not support the Gaddafi regime.
The meetings with Samir Al Maghrabi

41:25.250 --> 41:31.200
a brave LIA chief,
has had the exact opposite purpose.

41:31.240 --> 41:35.060
I no longer support Massimo.

41:35.100 --> 41:39.170
To ensure that Libya has a
free and democratic future.

41:39.210 --> 41:43.170
Has Al Maghrabi
broken with the regime?

41:43.210 --> 41:48.080
Mr. Al Maghrabi has secretly distanced
himself from the Gaddafi regime.

41:48.120 --> 41:54.080
We have been working to release
funds for post-war reconstruction.

41:54.120 --> 41:59.080
Al Maghrabi and the bank only
want the Libyan people's freedom.

41:59.240 --> 42:01.120
Any questions?

42:01.160 --> 42:04.230
Yes,
mr. Morgan. Do you want to elaborate?

42:05.020 --> 42:09.110
My opinion must be enough.
Thank you for your time.

42:11.220 --> 42:15.190
Following a joint statement
that Gaddafi must be overturned

42:15.230 --> 42:22.080
US and French aircraft began
to bomb the dictator this morning.

42:25.190 --> 42:27.140
Sofia.

42:29.090 --> 42:32.060
What is that? Nothing.

42:35.040 --> 42:36.150
Nothing?

42:36.190 --> 42:40.020
I sacrifice myself for
the matter. The case?

42:41.020 --> 42:43.190
It has nothing to do with the matter.

42:43.230 --> 42:49.150
Your obsession with getting revenge
on Morgan weakens your judgment.

42:49.190 --> 42:51.070
Piss and paper.

42:52.030 --> 42:55.200
Morgan is not the saint
the press makes him.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.120
The impression means everything.

42:59.130 --> 43:04.220
You put him in a positive
light by defying my orders.

43:04.260 --> 43:08.150
Wonder what Massimo
Ruggero is thinking.

43:16.220 --> 43:18.220
Aha...

43:18.260 --> 43:22.220
Months of work... I have his ear.

43:22.260 --> 43:27.020
I can speak... What
the hell was I saying?

43:27.060 --> 43:30.220
You don't go after someone
like Morgan with knives and guns.

43:30.260 --> 43:34.240
You come with an army or stay away.

43:38.060 --> 43:41.170
I regret. Are you sorry?

43:41.210 --> 43:47.160
Well, though. US freezes
$ 32 billion in Libyan assets

43:47.200 --> 43:52.020
and Morgan is making
millions selling shares.

43:52.060 --> 43:54.130
But as long as you're sorry...

44:02.080 --> 44:06.060
I have to rethink your
value for Subterranea.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.200
Daniel ...!

44:23.160 --> 44:27.160
If anyone can reverse a
situation just like you can

44:27.200 --> 44:32.240
I haven't met him yet. We
are impressed. And thankful.

44:33.180 --> 44:36.180
And very keen that it
doesn't happen again.

44:36.220 --> 44:38.060
It does not.

44:44.230 --> 44:49.150
Merciful God,
you know the mourner's grief.

44:49.190 --> 44:52.250
You listen to the humble prayer.

44:53.040 --> 44:56.210
Listen to your people
calling you in the time of need.

44:56.250 --> 45:01.140
Strengthen their hope
through your eternal goodness.

45:01.180 --> 45:06.190
We pray for this through
Christ our Lord. Amen.

45:09.050 --> 45:11.230
I am sorry. Thanks.

45:26.090 --> 45:30.180
It hurts me a lot. Do it?

45:32.110 --> 45:34.120
I know you shorted LIA.

45:36.040 --> 45:38.140
There's a reason Stuart died.

45:40.200 --> 45:46.040
I don't know what you think,
but I'm not the enemy.

45:47.100 --> 45:49.040
I hope so, you know.

45:52.110 --> 45:54.210
I've already lost a son.

45:56.060 --> 45:58.210
I don't want to lose another one.

46:23.040 --> 46:27.120
We are not a team. I
don't want you on my team.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.110
Go to hell!

46:38.040 --> 46:42.130
The bid came with this one.
They finally found it in his office.

46:42.170 --> 46:47.120
"Att. Claire Stuart".
Well. Get it analyzed.

46:47.160 --> 46:49.080
What does the autopsy say?

46:49.120 --> 46:56.260
The deceased has fractures
of the wrists and forearms.

46:57.050 --> 47:02.230
In addition, fractured upper arm bone and
a fracture of the right shoulder blade.

47:03.020 --> 47:04.200
He broke his arms.

47:06.150 --> 47:13.030
That's the way he did it. He
guarded himself with his arms.

47:13.070 --> 47:15.020
He was pushed...

47:15.060 --> 47:17.190
Yes.

47:25.180 --> 47:28.200
We are not a team.

47:28.240 --> 47:31.160
I don't want you on my team.

47:31.200 --> 47:33.170
Go to hell!

47:34.170 --> 47:39.260
A ragged Gaddafi was bleeding
profusely from a wound in his head

47:40.050 --> 47:44.040
and on the arm and from other
wounds on the neck and upper body.

47:44.080 --> 47:46.160
His kaftan was red with blood.
