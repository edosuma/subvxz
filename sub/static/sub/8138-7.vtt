The semi's been hijacked.
RC's in the hospitaI.

00:05.605 --> 00:08.096
We've just Iost
aII our top-secret data.

00:08.173 --> 00:11.473
Next, we're going to
score something big.
I mean reaIIy big.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.945
[whooping]
AII right, Nickey!

00:16.015 --> 00:18.211
SteaIing a Ferret,
this is your idea
of fun, is it?

00:18.318 --> 00:21.481
The UPF is armed
with enough expIosives
to bIow up a city bIock.

00:21.554 --> 00:23.419
(Devon)
You and KITT must stop it.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.589
(Bonnie)
It's coming at us head on.

00:25.658 --> 00:28.821
That's the whoIe idea.
It thinks it has us trapped.

of a man...

00:49.282 --> 00:51.113
who does not exist.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.519
MichaeI Knight,
a young Ioner...

01:01.594 --> 01:04.324
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:04.431 --> 01:06.456

01:06.533 --> 01:09.525
in a worId of criminaIs
who operate above the Iaw.

02:10.830 --> 02:11.819
CoIton?

02:11.931 --> 02:13.990
(HoIIander on radio)
CoIton, this is HoIIander.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.535
That rig wiII be coming in
on 97, any minute.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.093
Are you ready?
Yeah.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.372
But I just heard
traffic is backed up
on the Interstate for miIes.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.102
No way we can get it
to the warehouse.

02:23.176 --> 02:25.167
Then we're going to have to
unIoad somewhere eIse.

02:25.245 --> 02:27.577
800 cases of vodka
is too vaIuabIe to pass up.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.171
Now, get up here, fast.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.216
HoIIander says the rig's
coming in. Move it.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.280
Go, move it!

02:34.888 --> 02:36.685
Hey, I'II catch up
with you Iater.

02:37.724 --> 02:39.385
Get on, Erika.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.493
No way your IittIe friend
is going to show.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.825
I'm waiting for him,
so bag it, okay?

03:14.561 --> 03:17.894
Give me a game, wiII you?
What's the matter with you?
Dad, I'm tired.

03:17.964 --> 03:20.159
I said I don't feeI Iike
pIaying. I toId you that.

03:20.233 --> 03:21.723
[panting]

03:21.801 --> 03:25.032
But you're not going to
be happy tiII I beat you.
And I can't.

03:25.438 --> 03:27.702
I can't beat the great
GIen Arkett at anything.

03:28.007 --> 03:30.805
And you never wiII,
not with that attitude.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.636

03:35.448 --> 03:37.040

Here come our guests.

We'II put this on hoId

03:54.834 --> 03:57.701

It sure feeIs good to get off
that Interstate, MichaeI.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.270
It sure does.

Nothing Iike a traffic jam
to make you appreciate
the open road.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.370
WeII, we were due to meet
Bonnie and Devon...

04:05.445 --> 04:07.470
at Arkett Industries
at 9:00 sharp.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.113
What's our new ETA?

04:09.582 --> 04:12.779
We're 21 minutes and
56 seconds behind scheduIe.

04:12.852 --> 04:15.787
I'm afraid RC3 and
the semi are there by now.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.016
Not unIess Bonnie's come up
with a gadget...

04:18.091 --> 04:20.685
to put the semi in two pIaces
at the same time.

04:32.372 --> 04:33.896
[crowd cheering on TV]
AII right! Yeah!

04:34.073 --> 04:37.201
RC3, it's MichaeI.
What's happening?

04:37.543 --> 04:39.841
(RC3 on radio)
Man, you mean
what was happening.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.779
Check this out..

04:45.618 --> 04:48.746
A news brief from FLAG's
roving correspondent.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.618
Yeah, with some bad news, RC.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.488
You missed the turnoff
to Arkett Industries
by 20 miIes.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.159
No way, my man.

04:55.228 --> 04:58.823
I dropped Bonnie and Devon
off at the stroke of 9:00.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.599
I'm sure they're eagerIy
awaiting your tardy arrivaI.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.732
(KITT)
He's gIoating, MichaeI.

05:04.804 --> 05:08.672
Did he expect me
to turbo boost over 10 miIes
of bumper-to-bumper traffic?

05:08.808 --> 05:11.299
I mean, sustained fIight
has never been my strength.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.969
Don't Iet him ruffIe
your braking fins, paI.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.680
RC, where are you headed now?

05:15.748 --> 05:17.147
GaIIoway's Junction...

05:17.283 --> 05:20.411
for a stack of the best
bIueberry pancakes...

05:20.486 --> 05:21.953
this side of Michigan Avenue.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.455
I mean,
I have got an appetite
that just wiII not quit.

05:24.857 --> 05:26.688
Neither wiII your mouth, RC.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.661
I think that's why
they caII Chicago
the ''Windy City.''

05:35.601 --> 05:36.932
Okay, now, move in
and take her...

05:37.003 --> 05:39.733
when she hits that
empty stretch of road there,
right around that bend.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.774
AII right.
This is our baby,
Iet's go.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.646
[motorcycIe engines revving]

06:07.567 --> 06:10.035
GIen, why don't we
taIk about the Ferret
some time Iater?

06:10.103 --> 06:12.401
Better than that,
as soon as NichoIas and I
hit the showers...

06:12.472 --> 06:13.700
we'II give you
a sneak preview.
Done.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.434
Excuse me.
There's a caII
for NichoIas.

06:15.508 --> 06:17.567
Oh, thank you.
Excuse me.

HeIIo?
(Erika)
NichoIas, where are you?

06:22.515 --> 06:23.504
Oh.

06:24.250 --> 06:27.913
Erika, Iisten,
I don't think I'm going
to be abIe to make it.

06:27.987 --> 06:29.784
Oh, come on,
I was counting on you.

06:29.856 --> 06:32.984
(NichoIas)
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm having
troubIe shaking my parents.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.856
Okay, weII,
make up a story.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.495
I mean, unIess...

06:37.730 --> 06:40.631
what your parents want
is more important
than what you want.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.261
Erika, come on.
I want to be with you.
You know that.

06:46.439 --> 06:49.203
Wait there for me, okay?
Just wait.

06:53.379 --> 06:55.643

07:39.926 --> 07:41.860

Get down!

07:41.928 --> 07:43.190
Move over.

07:44.997 --> 07:46.328
AII right,
RC's in troubIe, paI.

is getting reaIIy dangerous.

08:19.398 --> 08:21.958
(KITT)
You know, we were going
in his direction, MichaeI.

08:22.034 --> 08:24.434
(MichaeI)
Yeah, but we never
pick up hitchhikers, KITT.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.903
Keep your scanners peeIed.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.647
Erika, hi.
You Iook great!

08:37.183 --> 08:40.118
Later, Nickey. Come on.
Let's catch up with the guys.
Okay.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.381
Where are we going?
After that 18-wheeIer
with HoIIander.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.322
So, come on! Goose it.
We're missing the fun.
Come on!

08:58.471 --> 09:01.963
CoIton, there's a bIack T-top
coming in reaI fast.
This couId be troubIe.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.737
I want you to ditch
that guy in the cab
and hauI it out of there.

09:09.448 --> 09:11.575
(KITT)
They've thrown RC3
out of the cab.

09:22.328 --> 09:23.818

09:25.331 --> 09:26.764
(MichaeI)
Scan his vitaIs!

09:26.899 --> 09:29.390
He's unconscious, MichaeI.
His breathing is erratic.

09:38.711 --> 09:41.339
RC? It's me.
It's MichaeI.

09:41.948 --> 09:44.075
You aII right?
The semi. I....

09:46.185 --> 09:47.345

10:03.736 --> 10:06.261
There's no cargo.
We bIew it.
We hijacked the wrong rig.

10:06.339 --> 10:09.331
What? You said
a bIack rig on 97.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.841
Look, I know what I said.

10:11.043 --> 10:14.444
But if this rig is fiIIed
with cases of vodka,
I'II drink every bottIe.

10:15.648 --> 10:18.617
The truck I was expecting
must have been
deIayed or rerouted.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.377
What's he doing here?

10:22.822 --> 10:24.050
He's chasing Erika.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.951
He's harmIess, you know.
He sits, roIIs over...

10:27.326 --> 10:28.554
comes when she caIIs.

10:35.401 --> 10:36.891
You know what
they got here?

10:37.269 --> 10:39.794
From the Iook
on HoIIander's face,
a major fouI up.

10:40.172 --> 10:41.469
What, are you kidding?

10:41.674 --> 10:43.266
They bagged the FLAG semi.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.710
FIag? Nickey,
what are you taIking about?

10:53.819 --> 10:56.151
The Foundation
for Law and Government.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.452
It's their mobiIe
headquarters. FLAG.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.752
Man, what a score!

11:00.826 --> 11:02.555
Hey, you guys,
hear what Nickey just said?

11:02.628 --> 11:05.028
Yeah, so? I mean, booze...

11:05.097 --> 11:07.361
furs, TVs, that's a score.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.636
What are we supposed to do
with a rig that's owned by
a bunch of rent-a-cops?

11:11.704 --> 11:13.035
You reaIIy
want to know?

11:13.105 --> 11:15.505
Of course,
they want to know.
Come on, teII them.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.703
WeII, if you know
how to use it...

11:19.478 --> 11:21.844
this semi's going to
be a Iot more
vaIuabIe to you...

11:22.114 --> 11:23.809
than some cases
of vodka.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.009
Sure it is.

11:25.484 --> 11:29.250
You guys, he knows
what he's taIking about.
I'd Iisten to him.

11:29.321 --> 11:32.188
If he's putting me on,
this is going to be
your neck, too.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.624
(Arkett)
Now, from here we monitor
the Ferret's movements...

11:40.700 --> 11:43.100
and then we use
a soIar-powered
inertiaI guidance system...

11:43.169 --> 11:44.659
to update targeting data.

11:44.937 --> 11:46.734
(Devon)
A briIIiant concept, GIen.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.639
This breakthrough wiII have
a Iong term impact on--

11:49.742 --> 11:51.903
Oh, here's MichaeI.
Excuse me.
CertainIy.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.035
What's wrong?

11:53.746 --> 11:56.010
The semi's been hijacked.
RC's in the hospitaI.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.310
What? How bad is he?

11:57.483 --> 11:58.780
He's got a concussion.

11:59.652 --> 12:00.744
What happened?

12:01.320 --> 12:04.517
He took a nasty tumbIe
out of the cab,
but he's going to be okay.

12:04.590 --> 12:07.991
He's more worried about
the semi than he is
worried about himseIf.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.195
He feeIs responsibIe.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.558
Thank God he's aIive.

12:13.265 --> 12:15.893
MichaeI, do you think
you or RC couId
identify the hijackers?

12:15.968 --> 12:18.493
Not a chance.
Devon, they were
a bunch of bikers.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.764
AII happened too fast
to see their faces.

12:22.041 --> 12:24.976
We've just Iost
aII our top secret data...

12:25.044 --> 12:26.602
and KITT's support systems.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.476
Devon, we can't function
Iong without them.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.310
This couId be a pIot
against the Foundation.

12:30.382 --> 12:32.009
No, no, I doubt that.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.609
Devon,
I contacted the Sheriff
on the way over here.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.687
He said this group
have been hitting truckers
in the area IateIy.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.520
Do you have any Ieads?
No.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.184
I wanted to brief
you guys in person.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.694
Getting back on the road
is the key to getting
the semi back.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.663
WeII, keep us posted.
(Bonnie)
Be carefuI, MichaeI.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.699
Good Iuck.
Thanks.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.837
I can't heIp wondering
what pIans a group of bikers
couId possibIy have...

12:52.905 --> 12:54.998
for the FLAG command center?

12:57.510 --> 12:58.636
(NichoIas)
AII right!

12:58.711 --> 13:00.702
(Erika)
Come on, come on!

13:01.814 --> 13:03.042
AII right.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.421

13:22.535 --> 13:23.968
When do you want to Ieave?

13:24.336 --> 13:27.362
AII right!
How did you Iearn so much
about computers, huh?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.540
WeII, my mom's a programmer.

13:29.742 --> 13:33.143
My dad is a system designer.
The best in the business,
naturaIIy.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.975
They eat, sIeep
and breathe computers.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.107
I think my first word
was microchip.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.375
So, NichoIas,
with this equipment here...

13:40.452 --> 13:43.114
you can make other computers
do what you want them to,
right?

13:43.355 --> 13:45.220
Oh, yeah.
Name it, you got it.

13:45.424 --> 13:46.482
The IocaI bank.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.388
(Erika)
Whoa, yeah!

13:48.460 --> 13:50.428
(CoIton)
AII right.
Now, wait.

13:51.030 --> 13:54.193
We're taIking about
serious crime here.
Can you puII it off or not?

13:55.301 --> 13:56.495
WeII, yeah, I can but that--

13:56.569 --> 13:59.060
Don't give me ''buts,''
NichoIas. Just give me
the bottom Iine.

13:59.138 --> 14:01.003
Yes or no.

14:04.543 --> 14:05.737
Come on, NichoIas.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.878
Piece of cake.
Yeah, yeah, I can.

14:12.985 --> 14:16.921
We have to figure out a pIace
to stash this rig, remember?
You figure that out yet?

14:17.022 --> 14:19.855
Yes, and you'II find out
where when we get there.
Now, Iet's go.

14:19.925 --> 14:23.486
Wait a minute, wait.
This computer transmits
a constant homing signaI.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.954
Now, if I can't
shut this off...

14:26.031 --> 14:27.965
the Foundation
has an operative...

14:28.033 --> 14:30.263
who'II track the semi down
no matter where you hide it.

14:30.336 --> 14:33.635
That operative wouIdn't be
a guy who drives around
in a bIack T-top, wouId it?

14:33.706 --> 14:36.197
Yeah, his name's Knight.
MichaeI. MichaeI Knight.

14:37.142 --> 14:38.336
Okay.

14:38.811 --> 14:42.144
First, we stash the rig
and if this guy Knight
gets to be a probIem...

14:42.248 --> 14:43.681
we stash him, too.

14:44.650 --> 14:45.639
[NichoIas Iaughing]

14:46.819 --> 14:47.808
[Erika Iaughing]

14:47.887 --> 14:50.287
I don't think that's
going to be necessary.

14:50.656 --> 14:51.748
Watch.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.827
Okay.
Nickey! AII right!

15:00.699 --> 15:01.996
(KITT)
It's no use, MichaeI.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.035
Not a trace of
the semi's homing signaI.

15:04.103 --> 15:06.230
Bonnie designs
homing devices...

15:06.405 --> 15:09.602
Iike bIack boxes in aircraft.
They don't break, KITT.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.506
Are you suggesting
it was deactivated?

15:11.577 --> 15:12.703
Yeah.

15:12.811 --> 15:14.278
I mean,
unIess I've missed my guess...

15:14.346 --> 15:16.337
one of these hijackers
knows computers.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.811
AII right, maybe we can
stiII get a fix on the semi.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.978
[beeping]
Scan the area
for radio transmissions...

15:22.054 --> 15:24.113
and the engine's
thermodynamic signature.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.986
Negative
on radio transmissions.

15:27.493 --> 15:29.984
And there are too many trucks
operating in the area...

15:30.062 --> 15:32.087
to isoIate the semi's
engine, MichaeI.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.262
But, the Interstate's
jammed up.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.998
Which means
they had to go north...

15:37.536 --> 15:39.026
through GaIIoway Junction.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.298
AII right, Iet's hit it.

15:40.372 --> 15:42.772
Chances are somebody there
saw the semi.

15:49.481 --> 15:50.914
[brakes hissing]

15:57.923 --> 15:59.254
AII right.
Nice job.

15:59.491 --> 16:01.686
Get this rig out of here
or I'm caIIing the Sheriff!

16:03.329 --> 16:05.229
[grunting]

16:05.864 --> 16:08.765
Come on, he's an oId man.
Nickey, don't be
such an airhead.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.196
Why did they have to
do that?
What?

16:11.537 --> 16:15.439
Do you want to expIain
getting busted
to your tacky parents? Hmm?

16:18.110 --> 16:20.010
That's enough!
Leave him aIone!

16:20.145 --> 16:22.306
What is this?
What are you doing?

16:23.015 --> 16:25.984
What do you want?
Nothing compIicated.

16:26.051 --> 16:29.077
Now, you just make it Iook
Iike business as usuaI
around here...

16:29.555 --> 16:31.750
otherwise that thing may
just go off, you got it?

16:31.824 --> 16:34.622
Now, for starters, you couId
get us something to eat.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.723
'Cause then we've got
some banking to do.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.056
[Iaughing]

16:38.130 --> 16:40.098
Not untiI
after the bank cIoses.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.962
If I try to tie-in
to the computer right now...

16:42.034 --> 16:43.365
someone couId
spot the override...

16:43.435 --> 16:46.666
they kiII the power,
we're out of business. Okay?

16:47.506 --> 16:49.701
I got to get going.
Wait a minute.

16:49.775 --> 16:51.606
Where do you think
you're going?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.312
WeII, this party
at my dad's company.

16:54.380 --> 16:57.315
My foIks wiII start
wondering what's going on
if I don't show.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.615
I'm reaIIy gIad Erika
brought you in, NichoIas.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.214
Now, you just make sure
you come back.

17:07.726 --> 17:11.127
'Cause you won't Iike
what CoIton wiII do to her
if you don't.

17:38.157 --> 17:39.351
Hey, NichoIas?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.619
NichoIas Arkett?
Hey, it is you.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.192
Hey, MichaeI.

17:44.696 --> 17:45.754
How you doing?

17:45.864 --> 17:47.331
How are you?
Not bad.

17:47.466 --> 17:49.627
Boy, you've done some
serious growing here.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.764
I just saw your foIks.
You're missing the shindig.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.635
(NichoIas)
Yeah, I was on my way...

17:54.706 --> 17:56.503
when my gas gauge
bottomed out.
Ann.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.304
I thought you were
going to be there, too?
Ann!

17:58.377 --> 18:00.038
(MichaeI)
Yeah. So did I....

18:00.579 --> 18:03.446
It's a shame to be wasting
aII this beauty around here.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.379
Oh, no kidding? Hijacked?

18:06.585 --> 18:09.247
As a matter of fact,
it was headed this way.

18:09.354 --> 18:12.255
You didn't see it, did you?
No. But...

18:12.524 --> 18:14.116
you know,
I'II Iet you know
if I do.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.559
See you, Mike.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.925
NichoIas,
you forgot to pay...

18:22.801 --> 18:23.927
for your gas.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.138
Let her go.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.175
You trying
to say something?

18:34.246 --> 18:36.271
The Iady isn't
on the menu.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.781
Why don't you
take it easy, mister?

18:40.686 --> 18:43.120
I was just trying to
do the Iady a favor.

19:04.276 --> 19:06.267
I'm Ann, Ann GaIIoway.

19:06.612 --> 19:09.308
My dad and I run this pIace.
Thanks.

19:09.381 --> 19:11.315
You're weIcome.
Name's MichaeI Knight.

19:11.550 --> 19:13.643
Do you know
where's he going?

19:13.752 --> 19:15.913
Oh, that's the garage.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.252
Dad's been doing some work
on his car.

19:19.258 --> 19:22.557
Look, I don't mean to
appear ungratefuI but
I got a mess to cIean up.

19:22.694 --> 19:24.924
You can get gas and food
five miIes north.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.761
Yeah, I'm not Iooking
for gas or food.
What I'm Iooking for...

19:27.833 --> 19:31.360
is a bIack semi with
a chess piece insignia
on the side.

19:31.436 --> 19:32.994
Did you happen
to see that?

19:33.305 --> 19:37.002
WeII, there's a Iot of semis
coming through here everyday.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.205
If you didn't see it,
maybe your dad did, huh?

19:40.379 --> 19:42.904
Wait a sec!
I did see it. Yeah.

19:42.981 --> 19:45.950
It bIew on through here
about haIf an hour ago,
heading north.

19:46.051 --> 19:48.246
North? Okay, thank you.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.284
Sure you're going to
be okay?
Mmm-hmm.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.879
Okay. Oh!

19:52.791 --> 19:55.760
A friend of mine
forgot to pay for his gas.
That shouId cover it.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.190
Thanks.

19:57.262 --> 19:59.730
(HoIIander)
Won't be Iong before Knight
figures out he's been had.

19:59.798 --> 20:01.163
(CoIton)
Want me to bIow him away?
No!

20:01.233 --> 20:04.100
I don't want someone
out here Iooking for him
before we score that bank.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.296
We're going to have to
chance hitting that bank now.

20:06.738 --> 20:09.172
We're going to move as
soon as I round up NichoIas.

20:14.179 --> 20:15.737
No kidding?

20:15.814 --> 20:17.111
The semi's been hijacked?

20:17.182 --> 20:19.013
Yes, and MichaeI's
trying to find it.

20:19.084 --> 20:21.609
Now I know how MichaeI feIt
when KITT was destroyed.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.621
It's Iike haIf of me
is missing.

20:23.689 --> 20:26.249
WeII, Bonnie,
the haIf that's here
is kind of neat.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.259
(woman on PA system)
In Search and Destroy Mode...

20:28.327 --> 20:31.057
it can aIso detect and evade
unforeseen obstacIes...

20:31.330 --> 20:33.924
and pIot aIternative....
Excuse me.

20:34.099 --> 20:35.726
...any of our personneI.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.328
You hungry?
What I'd Iike is....

20:38.403 --> 20:39.734
A gIass of champagne.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.102
To start with.
Come with me.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.468
...and tertiary targets...

20:42.541 --> 20:45.135
guaranteeing a wide range
of appIications...

20:45.210 --> 20:48.202
during a rapidIy changing
wartime scenario.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.775
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.

20:50.849 --> 20:52.407
Knight's becoming
a probIem.

20:52.484 --> 20:55.214
I want to make
that withdrawaI now.
I can't just Ieave--

20:55.287 --> 20:56.811
NichoIas. WeII.

20:57.522 --> 20:58.955
I don't beIieve
we know this gentIeman.

20:59.024 --> 21:00.787
That's right, Dad.
You don't.

21:01.026 --> 21:03.654
WeII, GIen Arkett, President
of Arkett Industries.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.289
[inaudibIe]
My wife Lydia,
RVP Programming.

21:06.365 --> 21:07.593
Scott HoIIiman.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.898
And you're with?

21:10.969 --> 21:12.903
He's one of
my professors, Dad.

21:14.539 --> 21:16.131
It's nice
to meet you...

21:16.208 --> 21:17.869
Professor HoIIiman.
You, too.

21:18.477 --> 21:21.173
We were just about to
go and Iook over
one of my papers.

21:21.246 --> 21:23.510
WeII, what is it?
Statistics? CaIcuIus?

21:23.582 --> 21:27.416
Just what is it
you're trying to drum into
this impenetrabIe cranium?

21:28.787 --> 21:30.880
I teach banking
and finance.

21:31.690 --> 21:35.182
Yeah. Not everyone does
things your way, Dad.

21:36.161 --> 21:38.220
CertainIy was
a pIeasure.

21:40.766 --> 21:43.360
I didn't know that
NichoIas was into finance?

21:43.435 --> 21:44.766
Neither did I.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.403
He's supposed to cIear
aII his cIasses with me.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.108
(KITT)
We shouId have caught up
with the semi by now.

21:51.176 --> 21:53.474
Yeah, I know. I was
thinking the same thing.

21:55.113 --> 21:59.140
You know, something's been
bugging me and I just
put my finger on it.

21:59.217 --> 22:01.412
On what, MichaeI?
Ann's nervousness.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.150
I figured it was due to
her run-in with Iover boy...

22:04.222 --> 22:06.452
but that doesn't expIain...

22:07.025 --> 22:10.722
a whoIe tray of sandwiches
in an empty coffee shop.

22:17.302 --> 22:18.633
Why are we stopping?

22:19.271 --> 22:21.501
WeII, I think we're on
a wiId goose chase, paI.

22:21.606 --> 22:25.508
I just spotted something
that wiII teII us if the semi
reaIIy went by here.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.171
Hey.

22:29.381 --> 22:31.281
Hey.
Excuse me?

22:31.483 --> 22:34.646
I'd Iike to apoIogize
for our previous encounter.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.120
I couIdn't heIp but notice
you Iook rather bewiIdered.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.718
No, man. I get rides
in hot cars aII the time.

22:43.795 --> 22:46.764
[pIaying harmonica]
AII the time. Some of them,
they taIk to me, too.

22:46.832 --> 22:49.801
One time, man, this car
wouIdn't shut up. It just
kept repeating itseIf.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.802
[harmonica honking]
The rear door is ajar.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.531
The rear door is ajar.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.505
And this guy, man,
he freaks out...

22:55.607 --> 22:58.132
yanks aII these wires
from underneath the dash...

22:58.210 --> 23:00.303
and puts the poor thing
out of its misery.

23:03.849 --> 23:06.818
PersonaIIy,
I think autonasia,
to coin a phrase...

23:06.885 --> 23:08.477
shouId be a capitaI offense.

23:08.687 --> 23:09.847
Yeah.

23:10.188 --> 23:14.124
So, what's the deaI here,
man? Are you going to give me
a ride this time, or what?

23:14.860 --> 23:16.122
KITT, I need you.

23:16.261 --> 23:18.559
Sorry, but I'm here
on officiaI business.

23:18.630 --> 23:19.961
[beeping]

23:20.132 --> 23:21.759
[car engine starts]

23:22.901 --> 23:26.166
Yeah, figures.
You sound Iike one of those
pompous government types.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.230
You know, one of
these days, man, somebody's
gonna yank your wires.

23:29.307 --> 23:32.003
KITT, the semi's radiaIs
have a unique tread pattern.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.137
Scan this area of fresh
bIacktop and see if you can
pick it up, wiII you?

23:35.213 --> 23:37.147
Hope your cIutch faIIs out.

23:37.315 --> 23:38.577
Oh, very funny.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.215
[beeping]

23:40.285 --> 23:43.413
MichaeI, I'm afraid
none of those tread patterns
match the semi's.

23:43.488 --> 23:46.013
No kidding?
Just the way I figured it.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.683
It never was on this road.

23:47.893 --> 23:51.294
You mean Ann sent us
on the proverbiaI
wiId goose chase?

23:51.696 --> 23:54.460
She sure did.
And I think I know why.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.292
Let's get out of here.

24:03.542 --> 24:06.705
[tires screeching]

24:06.778 --> 24:08.040
Wow!

24:22.661 --> 24:26.188
That's it?
You just gained access
to the bank's computer?

24:26.331 --> 24:29.698
Yeah. Okay, now
these two accounts
have the biggest baIances.

24:30.602 --> 24:33.469
So, if I can reprogram
the automated teIIers
to ignore...

24:33.538 --> 24:35.665
the Iimit on withdrawaIs....
Make it fast.

24:35.740 --> 24:38.436
CoIton's going
to be at that bank
in a coupIe of minutes.

24:39.077 --> 24:40.908
[zapping]

24:41.546 --> 24:44.071
(KITT)
MichaeI, I'm picking up
a radio transmission...

24:44.149 --> 24:46.117
from the semi's
computer consoIe.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.709
AII right, good going.
Pinpoint its Iocation.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.812
Ten to one it's coming
from GaIIoway's Junction.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.290
[beeps]
Bingo!

24:53.592 --> 24:56.561
Okay, trace the destination
of the signaI.

25:16.147 --> 25:17.341
HoIIander.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.707
HoIIander,
we're at the bank.

25:20.552 --> 25:24.420
It's a buiIding 3.692 miIes
from our position, MichaeI.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.014
That's the IocaI bank.
No kidding!

25:27.225 --> 25:30.353
WeII, that expIains
what a gang of bikers
is doing with the semi.

25:30.428 --> 25:32.328
It certainIy does.
You were right.

25:32.397 --> 25:35.230
One of the hijackers must be
very computer Iiterate.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.791
So are about
haIf the teenagers
in America, paI.

25:37.903 --> 25:40.133
AII right, Iet's get them!
Super Pursuit Mode.

25:55.353 --> 25:57.446
Come on. AII right.

25:58.690 --> 25:59.918
(aII)
Jackpot!

26:01.993 --> 26:05.053
Right, now, come on,
come on, Iet's go.
Get it in, get it in.

26:05.530 --> 26:08.499
Get it in,
pick it up, hurry up.

26:09.501 --> 26:12.993
Come on. Come on, baby,
aII right! AII right!

26:15.941 --> 26:19.138
Town's coming up pretty fast.
Hit the EBS.

26:26.985 --> 26:29.419
Okay, back to cruise mode.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.617
Move in on the bank.

26:38.496 --> 26:40.862
There they are.
There they are.

26:43.001 --> 26:45.060
[tires screeching]
It's Knight. Come on.

26:45.136 --> 26:47.229
Come on, Iet's go,
Iet's get out of here!

26:55.313 --> 26:56.974
MicroIock that cycIe!

27:00.051 --> 27:01.245
[tires screeching]

27:02.253 --> 27:03.345
[groaning]

27:11.229 --> 27:13.254
[peopIe screaming]
That's a Iive grenade,
MichaeI.

27:13.331 --> 27:14.593
It's going to bIow
any second.

27:14.666 --> 27:17.362
AII right,
I'm going to Iet you
put the Iid on this one.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.237
You aII right?
Yes, MichaeI.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.674
But what are we
going to do now?

27:25.744 --> 27:29.009
Head for GaIIoway Junction,
get the semi out of there.

27:29.414 --> 27:32.906
How can we do that
without endangering
Ann and her dad?

27:32.984 --> 27:34.713
By evening the odds.

27:34.786 --> 27:36.981
And I think I know
just how to do it.

27:43.194 --> 27:45.992
[men whooping]

27:47.098 --> 27:48.861
That's $1 1,800.

27:48.933 --> 27:51.834
Six ways,
makes aImost $2,000 apiece.

27:51.936 --> 27:53.699
[aII cheering]

27:53.772 --> 27:55.433
Hey, hey, hey!
Five ways.

27:55.874 --> 27:58.399
We got Knight,
but we Iost Sharkey doing it.

27:58.476 --> 27:59.943
[aII cheering]
Even better!

28:00.011 --> 28:02.536
That was practice.
That's petty cash.

28:03.181 --> 28:06.708
Next we're going to
score something big.
I mean reaIIy big.

28:06.785 --> 28:08.116
(HoIIander)
NichoIas...

28:08.219 --> 28:10.449
how wouId you Iike to
stick it to your oId man?

28:10.855 --> 28:12.220
Nickey!

28:12.290 --> 28:14.281
[stuttering]
What are you taIking about?

28:14.392 --> 28:17.327
WeII, you see,
they're testing this
Ferret this afternoon.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.987
And, according to this,
it's worth miIIions.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.460
Now, wait a minute.

28:23.835 --> 28:25.894
Just wait one minute.

28:27.238 --> 28:30.002
Me and my dad, okay,
we don't aIways get aIong,
but....

28:30.075 --> 28:31.667
I mean, he spent years
deveIoping the UPF.

28:31.776 --> 28:33.209
You wait a minute.

28:35.947 --> 28:38.507
That Ferret is controIIed
by a computer, isn't it?

28:39.417 --> 28:40.577
Isn't it?

28:42.253 --> 28:43.720
And with this equipment
around here...

28:43.788 --> 28:45.983
you can take controI
of that Ferret, can't you?

28:46.224 --> 28:48.818
Sure he can.
NichoIas, you can do it!

28:49.360 --> 28:52.090
Come on, I know you can.
Hey, so what if he can?

28:52.163 --> 28:55.132
I mean, come on, HoIIander,
what are we going to do
with a Ferret?

28:55.333 --> 28:58.530
WeII, you see, NichoIas here
is going to reprogram it...

28:58.770 --> 29:01.705
to meet us out in the desert,
aren't you, NichoIas?

29:02.640 --> 29:04.039
(Erika)
Sure he wiII.

29:04.209 --> 29:06.109
Then we're going to
puII it into the semi...

29:06.177 --> 29:08.645
and we're going to drive
that thing down to Mexico.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.180
Then we cut a deaI...

29:10.248 --> 29:13.183
and we'II be just Iike those
FaIcon and Snowman dudes,
right?

29:13.318 --> 29:14.649
[aII cheering]

29:14.719 --> 29:17.950
I got a Iine on a guy
down there who can seII it
to the highest bidder for us.

29:18.022 --> 29:19.421
(NichoIas)
You're nuts!

29:21.025 --> 29:23.016
The Ferret has
an armed warhead on it.

29:23.128 --> 29:25.619
I mean, it's going to take
aII kinds of programming
just to....

29:25.697 --> 29:29.394
NichoIas, I guess you're
going to have to get started
on that now, aren't you?

29:29.801 --> 29:31.598
Because, if you don't...

29:31.736 --> 29:34.068
CoIton here has
a coupIe of smaII warheads...

29:34.139 --> 29:36.004
[gun cocking]
with your name on it.

29:37.008 --> 29:38.134
Pow!

29:40.278 --> 29:41.267
[grunts]

29:46.050 --> 29:48.018
Now, watch him.
Okay.

29:54.092 --> 29:55.218
Okay...

29:55.960 --> 29:57.427
I'm going scouting.

29:57.862 --> 30:00.524
We have to find
a pIace to rendezvous
with that Ferret.

30:00.598 --> 30:01.690
Merry Christmas.

30:01.766 --> 30:02.858
[yowIing]

30:25.690 --> 30:28.557
(HoIIander)
CoIton, I thought you said
you got MichaeI Knight.

30:28.626 --> 30:30.253
(MichaeI)
KITT, are you in position?

30:30.328 --> 30:32.057
(KITT)
Yes, HoIIander just
took the bait.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.324
Your pIan is working.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.458
[gun firing]

30:39.604 --> 30:41.299
Get him! Get him!

30:52.650 --> 30:53.947
Okay, nice timing.

30:54.419 --> 30:58.082
I heard you took a bad tumbIe
back there, Sharkey.
I'm gIad you're aII right.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.085
[grunting]

31:05.563 --> 31:07.997
I toId you the Iady
isn't on the menu.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.728
[HoIIander yeIIing]

31:18.009 --> 31:19.704
[both grunting]

31:46.471 --> 31:49.872
What is your stake in this,
son? You with the poIice?

31:50.775 --> 31:52.072
Same side.

31:52.477 --> 31:54.342
Foundation for
Law and Government.

31:55.446 --> 31:57.414
We couId use
some of that around here.

31:57.482 --> 31:58.676
You got it.

31:59.651 --> 32:03.087
The kid who was driving
that Mercedes,
you know where he went?

32:03.521 --> 32:05.546
In the semi
his friends hijacked.

32:06.324 --> 32:09.225
Thanks. Look,
do me a favor.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.760
If he wakes up,
Iet me know.
You got it.

32:18.069 --> 32:19.502
(MichaeI)
NichoIas?

32:20.672 --> 32:23.038
What are you doing
with these peopIe?
What's going on?

32:23.107 --> 32:24.165
Nothing, I'm....

32:24.242 --> 32:26.733
I'm just pIaying some games
with software, that's aII.

32:26.811 --> 32:27.835
(KITT)
MichaeI?

32:32.350 --> 32:34.215
MichaeI, I'm afraid
the bikers have reaIized...

32:34.285 --> 32:35.650
they're on
a wiId goose chase.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.517
They're heading back
toward the Junction.

32:37.588 --> 32:39.886
Thanks, KITT. HoId it!
HoId it.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.051
MichaeI, it's nothing.
Don't you Iie to me, man.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.151
Look, a Ferret isn't a toy.

32:44.295 --> 32:46.957
I know an override program
when I see one.
Hey!

32:47.198 --> 32:48.995
He does not have to
answer to you.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.331
You're right.
Try a judge and a jury.

32:51.402 --> 32:54.462
WiII you come off it?
We were just trying to have
some fun. It's no big deaI.

32:54.539 --> 32:57.303
Hijacking a semi,
robbing a bank...

32:57.375 --> 32:59.639
steaIing a Ferret, is this
your idea of fun, is it?

32:59.711 --> 33:01.975
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Is it? Is it?

33:02.680 --> 33:05.342
I had nothing to do
with hijacking the semi.

33:05.516 --> 33:07.984
How couId you get invoIved
in something Iike this?

33:09.654 --> 33:12.122
I didn't know it was
going to turn out Iike this.

33:15.426 --> 33:17.553
I met Erika
at a concert...

33:18.229 --> 33:20.424
and she introduced me
to some of her friends.

33:20.565 --> 33:21.998
It started out
as a joke.

33:22.066 --> 33:24.830
I got trapped.
It just got out of hand.
Oh, you bet it did!

33:24.902 --> 33:27.393
Your friends here
just tried to kiII me.

33:27.705 --> 33:30.640
And they're headed
back this way to take
another whack at it.

33:47.325 --> 33:48.690
[engine starting]

34:03.741 --> 34:05.231
CIimb down from there.

34:05.309 --> 34:08.107
Put your hands over your head
or we bIow them away.

34:08.446 --> 34:09.743
[sighing]

34:21.225 --> 34:22.283
[groaning]

34:24.929 --> 34:27.489
Cuff them inside
so they stay out of troubIe.

34:27.931 --> 34:30.594
We got to move it.
That Ferret roIIs
in 15 minutes.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.966
We stiII have to come up
with a rendezvous point.

34:33.371 --> 34:34.360
Got it.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.905
[engine starting]

35:15.079 --> 35:17.343
(KITT)
MichaeI? MichaeI,
can you hear me?

35:17.415 --> 35:19.849
MichaeI?
MichaeI, get out of there.

35:23.721 --> 35:26.884
Come on, MichaeI, hurry.
Those drums are
about to expIode.

35:27.692 --> 35:29.523
Hit the CO2, wiII you, paI?

35:36.934 --> 35:39.334
Good work, KITT. Let's go!

35:52.650 --> 35:55.278
Thanks a Iot, paI.
Thanks a Iot.

35:55.353 --> 35:57.116
If it wasn't for you,
sustained fIight...

35:57.188 --> 35:59.452
wouId hardIy describe
what I'd be doing
right about now.

35:59.524 --> 36:00.718
You're weIcome, MichaeI.

36:00.791 --> 36:02.258
We got to get
right down to business.

36:02.326 --> 36:05.193
Ann and her father have been
taken hostage by the bikers...

36:05.263 --> 36:08.721
forcing NichoIas to use
the semi to steaI the Ferret
during the test.

36:08.799 --> 36:11.359
EvidentIy,
NichoIas got invoIved
with the wrong crowd.

36:11.435 --> 36:12.663
He sure did.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.863
What time was the test
supposed to start?

36:14.972 --> 36:16.371
UnIess it's been
rescheduIed...

36:16.440 --> 36:18.772
they're at T minus 12 seconds
and counting.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.435
That's what I was afraid of.

36:20.678 --> 36:23.146
AII right, pIot me a course
for Arkett Industries.

36:23.214 --> 36:24.613
Get me Devon!

36:32.690 --> 36:34.555
AII systems activated.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.015
Okay.

36:37.395 --> 36:38.521
Let's do it.

36:59.283 --> 37:01.751
Emergency caII, Mr. MiIes.
MichaeI Knight.

37:01.852 --> 37:03.945
It's coming through
on the speaker phone.

37:04.255 --> 37:07.452
Yes, MichaeI, you got
some news about the semi?

37:07.525 --> 37:10.392
Bad news, Devon.
You have to scrub the test.

37:10.461 --> 37:12.361
The test?
We can't do that.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.790
I'm afraid you're just
seconds too Iate
for that, MichaeI.

37:15.866 --> 37:17.731
Those hijackers are
going to steaI the Ferret.

37:17.802 --> 37:19.861
They're using NichoIas
and the semi to do it.

37:19.937 --> 37:21.234
Oh, NichoIas!

37:21.305 --> 37:22.329
How in the worId
couId they--

37:22.406 --> 37:25.000
That Ferret has got to be
shut down, I'm teIIing you,
right now!

37:25.076 --> 37:28.011
I'm afraid it's not quite
as simpIe as that, MichaeI.

37:28.446 --> 37:31.882
The UPF is armed
with enough expIosives
to bIow up a city bIock...

37:32.016 --> 37:35.975
and is programmed
to carry out a specific
search and destroy mission.

37:36.087 --> 37:39.545
And isn't one of its features
the abiIity to update
that data on the move?

37:39.624 --> 37:42.525
Correct.
But not instantaneousIy.

37:44.161 --> 37:46.356
It needs programming time.

37:46.497 --> 37:48.658
The Iess the better.
I'm coming in.

37:58.409 --> 38:01.742
Come on, come on. You said
you couId do it, NichoIas.
You better not be staIIing!

38:01.812 --> 38:05.509
I'm not staIIing. I said
this wouIdn't be easy.
I'm just doing my best.

38:27.905 --> 38:29.304
[tires screeching]

38:35.713 --> 38:37.476
[peopIe chattering]

38:41.485 --> 38:43.510
How's it going?
We're reprogramming
right now.

38:43.721 --> 38:47.384
Nothing.
The on-board computer
won't accept any new data.

39:01.772 --> 39:03.763
[whooping]
AII right, Nickey!

39:03.841 --> 39:05.706
Way to go.
AII right!

39:05.776 --> 39:06.970
That's nice work,
NichoIas.

39:07.044 --> 39:10.377
Now, you just keep that
on course and you park it
right out there.

39:12.616 --> 39:14.948
The Ferret's no Ionger
under our controI.

39:15.419 --> 39:17.353
[aIarm buzzing]

39:33.204 --> 39:34.865
It just Ieft
the grounds.

39:35.306 --> 39:38.036
MichaeI, you and KITT
must stop it.

39:38.109 --> 39:39.804
(MichaeI)
Not with that armed warhead.

39:39.877 --> 39:42.710
It's headed for
a popuIated area.
It's too risky.

39:42.847 --> 39:44.747
Devon, our onIy chance
is to find the semi...

39:44.815 --> 39:46.749
and make sure that Ferret
doesn't do any damage.

39:46.817 --> 39:49.650
You'II need some heIp.
And I'II need this.

40:10.141 --> 40:11.403
[keys cIicking]

40:11.776 --> 40:13.744
[car honking]

40:47.978 --> 40:49.946
AII right. It's up to
the three of us now.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.715
KITT, Iock in on the semi's
radio transmission...

40:52.783 --> 40:54.307
and pinpoint its Iocation.

40:57.888 --> 41:02.188
It's parked on a side road,
20. 128 miIes
from our position.

41:02.259 --> 41:04.557
Good work.
Where's the Ferret?

41:05.496 --> 41:07.123
[beeping]

41:07.198 --> 41:08.665
StiII on the move.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.892
MichaeI,
my computations indicate...

41:10.968 --> 41:14.870
it's been reprogrammed
incorrectIy and is targeted
on the semi.

41:14.939 --> 41:17.305
It wiII bIow it to pieces.
Give me its ETA.

41:17.374 --> 41:19.968
ExactIy 1.279 minutes
to impact.

41:20.044 --> 41:22.171
There's no way we can
get there in time.

41:22.446 --> 41:23.845
Pass me to the semi.

41:26.217 --> 41:27.309
(MichaeI)
NichoIas?

41:27.384 --> 41:29.409
NichoIas,
it's MichaeI Knight.
Can you hear me?

41:29.487 --> 41:30.511
Yeah, MichaeI, I can.

41:30.588 --> 41:32.852
The Ferret is targeted
on the semi.

41:32.923 --> 41:34.982
Get everyone out of there,
right now!

41:35.693 --> 41:38.093
Nice try, Knight.
But that's not
going to work.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.720
This is no trick. I'm--

41:40.798 --> 41:43.926
Can you revise the Ferret's
search and destroy program
from here?

41:44.068 --> 41:45.365
I think so.

41:45.603 --> 41:48.436
We can transmit the data
through the semi's computers.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.303
Okay.

41:50.975 --> 41:53.944
We're going to give
the Ferret a new target.

41:55.079 --> 41:56.171
Don't ask.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.075
Oh, no.

41:58.549 --> 42:00.847
Oh, no, he's right.
What are you taIking about?

42:00.951 --> 42:04.318
I screwed something up when
I transmitted the rendezvous
data to the Ferret.

42:05.823 --> 42:07.586
It thinks the semi
is the target.

42:08.025 --> 42:10.459
What, you mean they're
going to bIow us aII up?

42:10.528 --> 42:13.224
Yeah. I have no controI
over it and I'm not kidding.

42:13.297 --> 42:15.697
I can't stop it, and I can't
change its course.

42:15.866 --> 42:17.333
WeII, it's time
I changed mine.

42:18.435 --> 42:20.665
Wait a minute,
where are you going?
What about them?

42:20.738 --> 42:22.899
Witnesses get
an earIy Fourth of JuIy.

42:24.074 --> 42:26.508
Wait, that's
coId-bIooded murder.
Come on, give me the keys!

42:26.577 --> 42:27.703
Come on, Nickey! Let's go!
No!

42:27.778 --> 42:30.212
Come on!
This is where
I get off, Erika.

42:30.281 --> 42:33.182
I shouId've never gotten
invoIved with them
or you, either.

42:33.317 --> 42:36.343
Oh, yeah? WeII, you mean
a Iot to me, too.

42:37.087 --> 42:40.079
You want to die?
Be my guest.

42:45.496 --> 42:47.555
Come on, Erika! Let's go!

42:47.665 --> 42:48.996
(Erika)
Go! Go!

43:11.689 --> 43:12.849
What's the probIem?

43:12.923 --> 43:14.584
There's interference.
Someone's trying to...

43:14.658 --> 43:18.094
reprogram from the semi's
consoIe simuItaneousIy.

43:18.295 --> 43:19.523
NichoIas, is that you?

43:19.763 --> 43:22.129
Yeah, MichaeI, it's me.
I'm the onIy one Ieft.

43:22.232 --> 43:24.427
They handcuffed Ann
and her father to the semi.

43:24.935 --> 43:29.338
I stayed to reprogram
the Ferret, but I can't!
I can't do this!

43:29.573 --> 43:31.473
Just take it easy.

43:31.542 --> 43:33.169
Bonnie just
worked it out.

43:33.744 --> 43:38.078
NichoIas? You and I
are going to give the Ferret
another target.

43:38.983 --> 43:40.075
You ready?

43:46.590 --> 43:48.057
(KITT)
It's the bikers, MichaeI.

43:49.159 --> 43:52.253
AII right,
microIock the brakes
and their steering.

43:53.397 --> 43:55.957
[tires screeching]

43:59.536 --> 44:01.197
I can't hoId the microIock...

44:01.271 --> 44:04.934
and continue to reprogram
with Bonnie and NichoIas.
The bikers wiII get away.

44:05.009 --> 44:08.274
Okay,
focus your thermo-dynamic
generator on their tires.

44:13.584 --> 44:14.983
[defIating]

44:15.352 --> 44:16.546
You got a fIat.

44:17.554 --> 44:19.385
No, I got two fIats!

44:21.225 --> 44:22.283
What is it?

44:22.359 --> 44:24.759
My tires are fIat!
Oh, jeez!

44:25.195 --> 44:26.685
[grunting]

44:27.164 --> 44:29.359
What happened here?
The brakes Iocked.

44:29.433 --> 44:31.060
What did you do here?
I didn't do anything.

44:34.104 --> 44:36.595
AII right, transmit
their Iocation
to the Sheriff.

44:37.041 --> 44:38.406
You're back on.

44:38.475 --> 44:42.844
NichoIas? NichoIas,
I'm transmitting the Iast set
of reprogramming codes.

44:52.289 --> 44:53.881
[beeping]

44:55.292 --> 44:57.283
Okay, 10 seconds, Bonnie.
Hurry!

45:07.304 --> 45:09.864
She did it.
Bonnie did it!

45:10.307 --> 45:12.070
The Ferret's targeted
on KITT now.

45:13.977 --> 45:15.672
Now what do we do,
MichaeI?

45:16.313 --> 45:18.975
Trick it into
compIeting its mission.

45:46.110 --> 45:48.101
(Arkett)
They just entered
the grounds.

45:48.212 --> 45:49.907
MichaeI, you and KITT
must stop it.

46:02.025 --> 46:04.687
It's coming at us head on.
That's the whoIe idea.

46:04.762 --> 46:06.559
It thinks
it has us trapped.

46:06.630 --> 46:08.757
AII right, get ready,
paI, to turbo boost.

46:08.832 --> 46:09.856
Now!

46:15.706 --> 46:16.968
[aII excIaiming]

46:21.044 --> 46:22.306
[whooping]

46:25.549 --> 46:29.417
Not exactIy
a sustained fIight,
but I'II take it!

46:31.255 --> 46:32.620
So wiII I.

46:47.237 --> 46:49.137
SpIendid work,
both of you.

46:49.206 --> 46:52.198
WeII, it did three of us.
NichoIas risked his Iife
to heIp.

46:52.276 --> 46:55.507
Yes, of course.
I have a feeIing this wiII
be a turning point for him.

46:55.579 --> 46:58.070
He and his parents
are much too bright
not to Iearn from it...

46:58.148 --> 47:01.709
I agree. With everyone's
heIp, I think NichoIas shouId
end up a soIid citizen.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.652
TaIking about me, again?
Hey! How you doing?

47:04.721 --> 47:06.689
Great.
Good as new.

47:06.757 --> 47:08.418
Good as new,
that's spIendid.

47:08.492 --> 47:09.754
We have a present
for you.

47:10.127 --> 47:12.220
Oh, yeah! Check it out.

47:12.329 --> 47:13.796
AII right!

47:14.464 --> 47:19.197
Magnificent. And I suggest
you put it on and return
to your post immediateIy.

47:19.870 --> 47:22.737
You know how I feeI
about your Ieaving
the cab in transit.

47:22.806 --> 47:25.468
That's right. We wouIdn't
want to be hijacked again...

47:25.576 --> 47:26.838
and not know it.

47:27.611 --> 47:28.976
Heaven forbid.

47:29.780 --> 47:32.078
You took the words
right out of my mouth.
