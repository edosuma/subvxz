- Anna.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.746
He could have told me...
- Y-you cannot blame--

13:54.790 --> 13:59.403
You cannot blame yourself.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.623
- Yes, of course.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.233
Can we have somebody drive
you to your hotel?

14:03.277 --> 14:06.889
- No, no, thank you.
I am fine.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.543
I'm fine.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.244

gets through the day.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.855

14:18.248 --> 14:21.425
'Cause we do. We invite these
strangers into our homes,

14:21.469 --> 14:23.601

control of our children.

I don't--

14:26.256 --> 14:28.476
I don't think
I could leave Noah.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.263

all wrong, Liv.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.794
You screwed me, pal.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.361

He lives
on the Lower East Side.

14:49.410 --> 14:50.890

I mean, who--

14:54.502 --> 14:58.506

Julian, and I quote, "screwed."

of "New York Quarterly."

15:09.169 --> 15:13.477
We both blew our 140 bucks
on beers at the White Horse.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.827
- The White Horse.
What

15:15.871 --> 15:19.657
- It's where Dylan Thomas
drank himself to death.

15:19.701 --> 15:23.531
We dreamed of writing
our own lyrical ballads.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.228
That's what that phone message
was about.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.621
We were supposed to
spend three months

15:26.664 --> 15:28.492

and write.

15:29.754 --> 15:30.842

15:30.886 --> 15:32.583
She wasn't gonna
foot the bill.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.848
Yes, I was angry,
but not enough to kill.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.854
- Julian told me that Anna
let the ski lodge in Vail

15:42.898 --> 15:44.421
fall into foreclosure.

15:44.465 --> 15:46.206
She was trying to keep it
together around him,

15:46.249 --> 15:49.209

something was up.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.213
Somebody killed them
over money?

15:53.256 --> 15:57.304

people get dead.

16:04.964 --> 16:05.094
.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.836
- I think Mr. Bernstein
was pulling your leg.

Anna Mill's got over
$3 million

16:09.577 --> 16:11.622

- That after paying off

16:11.666 --> 16:13.189
the mortgage on the brownstone.
- Hold on, hold on.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.191
So what, we're just
gonna forget about Dolores?

16:15.235 --> 16:17.063
- I mean, she's in Rikers.
I don't think they're gonna

16:17.106 --> 16:18.890
give her the key.
Liv wants us to cover

16:18.934 --> 16:20.762
all the bases.

Julian's supposed to
be a writer, right, a poet?

16:22.764 --> 16:24.244
- It sounds better
than "unemployed."

16:24.287 --> 16:26.898
- Well, he's got a money market
account at Central

16:26.942 --> 16:29.858

16:40.608 --> 16:42.871

16:58.017 --> 17:00.845
supplemental legal services
for law firms.

17:00.889 --> 17:04.066
- Why would we need someone
else to service our clients?

17:04.110 --> 17:07.113
- You tell us--your company
wrote regular checks to 'em.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.855
Anna's husband
was the president?

17:13.336 --> 17:18.298
- The bills are all
expensed to Anna's clients.

17:18.341 --> 17:23.694
That must have been what red
flagged the firm for the audit.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.783
She had to know
that that was coming.

17:25.827 --> 17:29.004
- What do you say we take
a look at her office?

17:29.048 --> 17:32.616
- I hate to get all legal
on you here, but...

17:32.660 --> 17:36.229
considering where we are,
you're gonna need a warrant.

17:36.272 --> 17:38.796
- So the amounts that
that law firm billed,

17:38.840 --> 17:40.885
the clients never noticed
that they were paying expenses

17:40.929 --> 17:42.800
to an outside company.
- That she owned.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.193
- It was actually
her husband's,

17:44.237 --> 17:45.629
but I just don't think
he was in on this.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.109

don't like money?

17:47.153 --> 17:48.806

East 49th Street.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.721
The mailbox
was on West 121st street.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.680
Julian didn't do anything
all day.

17:52.723 --> 17:54.421
If he was in on this,
it would have made more sense

17:54.464 --> 17:56.162
if he'd just picked
up the checks himself.

17:56.205 --> 17:57.685
- Would have taken
a lot of trips,

17:57.728 --> 18:00.035
because GBT took in over
$3 million

18:00.079 --> 18:01.689

18:01.732 --> 18:03.995

18:04.039 --> 18:05.910
but that doesn't make her
a murderer, guys.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.129
We're talking about
her children.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.783
- Nobody's saying that, Liv.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.176
- All right, what if, uh,

18:10.219 --> 18:12.265
what if she owed money
to somebody

18:12.308 --> 18:14.136

18:14.180 --> 18:16.138
And she was late
in paying that person back.

18:16.182 --> 18:20.142

Why would anyone kill the kids?

18:20.186 --> 18:21.796

18:23.363 --> 18:25.104

Wow.

Um, okay.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.700
Get 'em to the lab.

a shoe print or something.

it be the mother?

19:26.774 --> 19:28.297

26:39.728 --> 26:40.903
- It's nothing.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.688
- Just tell me.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.780
- Usually when I'm leaving,

26:47.823 --> 26:51.000
Mrs. Anna says
"Buenas Noches."

26:51.044 --> 26:53.699
Good night.

26:53.742 --> 26:56.789
That night,
she said "adios."

26:59.313 --> 27:02.185
- And she kissed me.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.797
She never kisses me.

27:11.281 --> 27:15.285
- Well, thank you, um,
thank you, Dolores.

27:15.329 --> 27:22.075
Um, you've--you've been
extremely helpful.

27:23.250 --> 27:27.080
- For ten years,
she treated me so well.

27:27.123 --> 27:29.604
She helped me stay
in this country.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.301
My brother, too.

27:31.345 --> 27:34.783
I would have nothing
without her.

27:37.003 --> 27:39.614
- You take care of yourself.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.799
- Well, it's a start.

27:50.843 --> 27:53.106
Anna knew what she was gonna
do the night before she did it.

27:53.149 --> 27:55.717
- Look, we're splitting
legal hairs here.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.850
Insane.
Not insane.

27:57.893 --> 28:01.244
She kissed the nanny.
She said, "Good-bye."

28:01.288 --> 28:03.072
She planned
on killing her family.

28:03.116 --> 28:04.726
- And she deserves
to be punished.

28:04.770 --> 28:07.250
- Exactly. So what kind of
legal system do we have

28:07.294 --> 28:09.688
if a woman like Anna Mill
could end up in a hospital

28:09.731 --> 28:11.733
and not in prison?

28:11.777 --> 28:13.909
- I hope one of you
had the clam chowder.

28:13.953 --> 28:17.043
It's the best I've had since
I dropped my kid off at BU.

28:17.086 --> 28:20.002
Billy O'Boyle.
- Olivia Benson.

28:20.046 --> 28:22.004
- Like I don't know.
- Mr. O'Boyle does--

28:22.048 --> 28:25.094
- Billy.
- Does his homework.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.748
- Well,
can I buy you two a drink?

28:26.792 --> 28:29.098
- Actually,
I have a son at home.

28:29.142 --> 28:30.360
But thank you.

28:30.404 --> 28:32.406
- I don't know
how you do it.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.756
I know you're top-of-the-line
at one,

28:34.800 --> 28:37.150
but how do you rate
at the other?

28:40.849 --> 28:42.851
- Good-bye.
- Good night.

28:42.895 --> 28:45.375
- Open mouth, insert foot.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.684
I don't know when
I'm gonna realize:

28:49.728 --> 28:53.296
the fairer sex
is the more sensitive sex.

28:53.340 --> 28:55.298
So you gotta hand it to 'em
these days.

28:55.342 --> 28:58.301
They gotta be smart, pretty,

28:58.345 --> 29:01.174
bring home the bacon
and fry it up in the pan.

29:01.217 --> 29:03.698
- Hm. You know, that sounds
like an opening statement.

29:09.835 --> 29:13.099
- I spoke with Mrs. Mill
several times.

29:13.142 --> 29:16.929
The first was shortly after
she committed the murders.

29:16.972 --> 29:18.452
- Objection.

29:18.495 --> 29:20.236
- The defendant admitted
she murdered her family.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.325
- No, she did not--she stated
that she killed them.

29:22.369 --> 29:24.806
It does not become murder
until the people establish

29:24.850 --> 29:26.808
the necessary mens rea.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.289
It is the defense position
that a mental defect

29:29.332 --> 29:31.987
prevented her from ever
forming the requisite intent.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.293
- Sustained.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.469
- Please continue, Lieutenant.

29:35.512 --> 29:38.298
- I spoke with her shortly
after she killed her husband,

29:38.341 --> 29:41.083
Julian, her daughter, Rachel,

29:41.127 --> 29:43.129
and her son, Charlie.

29:44.478 --> 29:47.133
- She was traumatized
by their deaths,

29:47.176 --> 29:51.267
she was emotional,
she was disoriented.

29:53.356 --> 29:56.011
- Yes.
- What about the last time

29:56.055 --> 29:59.014
you spoke with her?
- I've been a cop for 20 years,

29:59.058 --> 30:02.017
and never in my career

30:02.061 --> 30:04.150
have I seen
anything like this.

30:04.193 --> 30:09.372
She convinced herself
that murdering her children

30:09.416 --> 30:13.333
and murdering her husband
was the only choice.

30:13.376 --> 30:16.466
So, this woman deserves
to be in prison.

30:16.510 --> 30:19.078
She's not "legally" insane.

30:19.121 --> 30:20.993
- Thank you.

30:24.083 --> 30:27.521
- How many years have you been
a professional psychiatrist?

30:27.564 --> 30:29.262
- I'm not a psychiatrist.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.874
- I'm just a cop.

30:32.918 --> 30:35.485
- So you really can't tell us
whether or not Mrs. Mill

30:35.529 --> 30:38.184
is a card-carrying
schizophrenic who hears voices

30:38.227 --> 30:39.881
telling her to kill her family.

30:39.925 --> 30:42.057
- No, but the psychiatrist can.

30:42.101 --> 30:45.408
You heard Dr. Abernathy's
testimony.

30:45.452 --> 30:48.237
She said that the defendant
did not hear voices.

30:48.281 --> 30:52.894
- So then is it fair to say,
in your professional opinion

30:52.938 --> 30:55.418
as a cop, that when you spoke
with Mrs. Mill

30:55.462 --> 31:00.162
after the killing, she did not
appear to be legally insane?

31:00.206 --> 31:02.382
- Yes, that is correct.

31:06.255 --> 31:11.434
Earlier, when she raised
the knife and plunged it

31:11.478 --> 31:15.134
into the tender bodies of her
children and her husband--

31:15.177 --> 31:18.833
the three people that she loved
the most in the world.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.226
What about then?

31:20.269 --> 31:22.576
Did she appear to be insane
to you then?

31:22.619 --> 31:24.839
- Unfortunately
I wasn't there then.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.885
- But that's the moment.

31:26.928 --> 31:30.323
That's the only moment
that matters.

31:30.366 --> 31:32.325
Isn't it, Lieutenant?

Okay, we'll talk.

Smooth.

How was court?

into that building.

32:09.101 --> 32:10.885
I don't care if she's crazy.

I turned out the
light and then...

32:24.290 --> 32:30.122
And then I just stood there...
watching him sleep.

32:30.165 --> 32:32.559
For two hours.

32:33.995 --> 32:36.041

Right.

that you loved your family,

I would do anything for them.

in a basement apartment.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.372
My family had nothing,

33:46.415 --> 33:49.505
I had to work for
everything that I have.

And everywhere I looked,
every book I read,

33:52.856 --> 33:55.598
every magazine,

They were running for Congress.

stabbed them.

- Withdrawn.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.760

the one you saw saving your
family from the suffering,

35:28.343 --> 35:29.736
did you say anything to her?

35:29.779 --> 35:31.607
- You testified

35:31.651 --> 35:33.261
it was like
watching another woman.

35:33.305 --> 35:34.828
I just wanted to know
if you spoke to her

35:34.871 --> 35:38.701
before she stabbed
your husband and your children.

35:38.745 --> 35:41.400
- No.

35:41.443 --> 35:43.619
- She wasn't real.
- But you thought she was,

35:43.663 --> 35:44.707
isn't that right?
I mean, that's your proof

35:44.751 --> 35:47.710
that you're insane.

35:47.754 --> 35:49.408
- No, I didn't try to stop her.

35:49.451 --> 35:51.323
- Because you wanted them dead,
isn't that right?

35:51.366 --> 35:53.281
- Because I wanted
to protect them.

35:53.325 --> 35:56.197
They're better off now.

35:56.241 --> 35:59.287

35:59.331 --> 36:02.203
- No. It's not.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.249
- Without me.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.904

Mrs. Mill.

36:07.948 --> 36:10.298
You're not so great.
- Objection.

36:10.342 --> 36:11.647

I protect them.

36:19.394 --> 36:22.223
It is a hard world,
Mr. Stone,

36:22.267 --> 36:26.532
and I didn't want to watch my
babies be swallowed up by it.

36:27.533 --> 36:30.275
- Then why didn't
you just kill yourself?

36:30.318 --> 36:32.407
- Objection.
- Sustained.

36:32.451 --> 36:34.583
- Nothing further, Your Honor.

36:43.636 --> 36:45.855

"If I don't, I have failed.

of her own mother telling her,

37:17.800 --> 37:22.414
"You need to earn money,
or the world will eat you

37:22.457 --> 37:24.981
and your offspring raw."

37:25.025 --> 37:28.333
She heard Betty Friedan
and Gloria Steinem telling her,

37:28.376 --> 37:30.248
"You are the equal
to any man."

37:30.291 --> 37:31.727
She heard Hillary say,

"Aim high,
but rely only on yourself."

I have to, I--"

37:39.953 --> 37:45.393

when you can't?

drive you crazy.

37:49.658 --> 37:55.316
Crazy to do what Anna Mill did.

37:55.360 --> 38:00.278
You would have to be...
crazy.

38:12.855 --> 38:15.902

into Mr. O'Boyle's trap.

38:15.945 --> 38:18.948
I very nearly stood up here
and told you that today's woman

38:18.992 --> 38:20.776
can do it all.

Surely women can have it all--

38:30.830 --> 38:34.573
but just not all
at the same time.

38:36.488 --> 38:40.100
This case,
it isn't about feminism.

her daughter, and her husband.

That's it.
It's that simple.

we find the defendant

40:06.534 --> 40:09.842
not guilty.

40:10.973 --> 40:13.019
- On the third count
of the indictment,

40:13.062 --> 40:15.761
murder in the second
degree of Julian Mill,

40:15.804 --> 40:19.852
we find the defendant,
Anna Mill,

40:19.895 --> 40:21.854
guilty.

40:32.473 --> 40:33.735
- The jury couldn't accept

40:33.779 --> 40:36.521
that a sane woman would
kill her children.

40:36.564 --> 40:39.480
- I meant legally sane.

40:39.524 --> 40:41.656
- I know what you meant.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.963
Lieutenant Benson.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.231
Thank you.

40:56.279 --> 41:00.022
Anna Mill just hung herself
in her cell.
