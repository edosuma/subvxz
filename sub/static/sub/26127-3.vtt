WEBVTT

00:16.475 --> 00:18.477
Can you not film me right now?

00:20.395 --> 00:22.397
Why am <i>I</i> being put in jail?

00:22.856 --> 00:25.901
<i>You can look up and around
as long as it's a straight-ahead picture.</i>

00:26.777 --> 00:30.280
<i>Take me where I can go to a phone
with my Mom, and charge my phone.</i>

00:30.364 --> 00:32.658
<i>"Can you charge my phone?
Can I take a shower?"</i>

00:32.991 --> 00:35.702
<i>Would you like a coffee
and a cheeseburger with that, too?</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:39.373
<i>You can't charge your phone in jail,
ma'am. That's not how we do things.</i>

00:46.171 --> 00:47.756
<i>I'm honestly scared.</i>

00:48.799 --> 00:50.842
<i>I have never been in jail before.</i>

00:53.303 --> 00:54.763
All right, come over here.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.558
Second, step in here, put your feet
in the yellow footprints.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.142
Separate your arms.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.395
- Like this?
- There you go.

01:01.478 --> 01:06.817
I'm in here right now because
I had an altercation with my fiancé.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.404
I wanted to leave.
He didn't want me to leave.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.197
So, he started pushing on me.

01:12.281 --> 01:14.575
I'm like, "Hey, don't touch me.
Don't touch me."

01:14.658 --> 01:16.034
'Cause he just kept touching me

01:16.118 --> 01:18.912
and I had to defend myself
as of that point.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.124
Have a seat for a minute.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.877
But the officers pulled up,
he was acting completely calm,

01:25.961 --> 01:27.629
which was so weird.

01:28.672 --> 01:32.050
I overreacted,
and I just couldn't control myself.

01:33.969 --> 01:34.886
The cops was like,

01:35.470 --> 01:38.432
"Um, calm down,
like if you don't shut up, um,

01:39.808 --> 01:40.892
I'm taking you to jail."

02:21.516 --> 02:23.685
Well, the first time I got arrested,
I was drivin'

02:23.769 --> 02:25.270
with... with no license.

02:25.354 --> 02:28.357
I wasn't out doin' anything,
but I made a mistake.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.406
Some people make mistake in life
and I made those mistakes,

02:36.490 --> 02:37.908
and I'm paying the consequences.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.577
I got hit with a felony,
doin' stupid stuff.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.627
I just made a horrible mistake
and I'm tryin' to just get back

02:48.710 --> 02:50.587
to contributing to society.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.216
I try to exercise some balance
and learn from my mistakes

02:54.299 --> 02:56.426
and learn from my decisions,
learn from the pain,

02:56.510 --> 02:59.054
learn from
every angle of this experience I can,

02:59.137 --> 03:02.557
so that I can keep myself in a situation
where I don't have to repeat this.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.520
<i>Turn around. Face the wall.</i>

03:13.735 --> 03:15.404
Turn around. Put your back on the wall.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.951
Look at the camera.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.622
Sixty-five, 67, 68.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.375
Three sixty-eight sound right?

03:28.542 --> 03:29.960
I guess my other 200,

03:30.085 --> 03:32.587
I guess he said
they'll take into evidence.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.465
Uh, I don't know about that.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.551
Yeah, it was supposed to be five.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.720
Okay.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.097
So, I'm armed robbery, no priors.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.308
Foolishness.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.520
I... I feel like...

03:49.855 --> 03:50.897
a fish out of water.

03:52.441 --> 03:56.236
You know, I ain't never ever in my life
been charged with no armed robbery,

03:56.319 --> 04:01.324
Nothin' like that. Don't have any priors.
You know, you feel pretty helpless.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.243
You know, I'm stressed out.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.829
I'm thinkin' now why I'm in here,
you know, what am I gonna do?

04:06.496 --> 04:09.750
Morris, stand in the yellow area
with your hands out of your pockets.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.376
I will verify your information.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.128
- How tall are you?
- Six five.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.338
- What do you weigh?
- About 185.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.673
And have you been here before?

04:16.757 --> 04:17.757
- No, ma'am.
- Okay.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.386
- These are your charges...
- Okay.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.346
- ...with your bond amount.
- Okay.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.558
Um, I was gonna ask,
with being charged,

04:26.641 --> 04:28.310
um, I have an interview tomorrow.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.979
When they do the background check,
will that appear?

04:31.062 --> 04:33.440
- I don't think it would appear that soon.
- Okay.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.526
I'm not from here.
I'm from Florida.

04:36.610 --> 04:41.823
I was up here, you know, um,
I have a $45,000-a-year job,

04:42.115 --> 04:43.950
you know, uh, interview tomorrow,

04:44.367 --> 04:46.828
for a management position
at a manufacturing company.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.583
Come on over.
I'm going to need your left wrist.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.836
I'm just trying to get myself out,
you know,

04:54.920 --> 04:58.548
so I can still catch that interview
tomorrow, you know, at eight o'clock.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.301
You know? So that...
that's all that I'm thinking about.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.866
They're gonna take you at one?
- Mm-hmm

05:24.950 --> 05:27.452
Yeah, I'm leaving this room
tonight at one o'clock.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.166
I'm just really excited
to get home.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.752
I'm so excited to go home.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.964
I can't believe it, you know?

05:39.297 --> 05:42.425
I didn't think the 60 days
would ever be, like, over.

05:43.927 --> 05:44.803
I don't know.

05:45.136 --> 05:48.640
I look at this picture on my arm band
and I was literally so fucked up

05:48.932 --> 05:51.685
and it's like...
that doesn't even look like me.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.272
I turned into a monster
and I didn't even see it.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.487
I didn't start doin' meth
till I was 19 years old.

06:02.863 --> 06:06.241
When I should have known better,
when I had seen what it had done to people

06:06.324 --> 06:09.536
and it's like I still fell into it
and it's like it can happen to anybody.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.664
They don't lie about it, man.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.167
The first time you do it, you're hooked.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.755
I haven't stayed with my mom
in, like, two years.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.842
You talked to her though,
within that time, right, or no?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.260
No, not really.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.014
I was kind of meth-ed up.

06:30.932 --> 06:34.185
I was homeless,
but I was homeless on my own account.

06:34.811 --> 06:38.064
I didn't want to be in my house
shootin' up meth,

06:38.523 --> 06:40.442
havin' my mom walk in on me.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.819
Like, I always had the chance to go home.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.821
I just chose drugs.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.450
I put myself in a big mess.

06:49.367 --> 06:53.038
Like, I'm disappointed in myself,
honestly.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.082
I've accomplished nothing.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.502
Wasn't always going to jail, you know?

06:59.586 --> 07:01.671
I mean, I like being outdoors.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.091
I like sports.
I did gymnastics for a while.

07:05.550 --> 07:08.470
- You gonna go back to school?
- I might.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.183
I gotta help myself first
before I can do anything else.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.143
I wanted to go to college.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.812
I wanted to be a criminal investigator.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.231
Now, I'm a third-time felon, 20 years old.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.192
I can't...
I don't even know what I'm gonna do.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.862
I don't know what job I could get, besides
working at McDonald's at this point.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.531
And it sucks.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.621
Like, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.554
I don't know nobody to call.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.601
So what happens
after this process?

07:57.310 --> 07:59.145
You're gonna be in here
for a little while.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.607
- I'm gonna be in here for a little while?
- Couple of hours at least.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.067
What the hell?

08:04.401 --> 08:08.238
I'm sorry, y'all, I'm freakin' out.
This is my first time bein' in jail so...

08:10.323 --> 08:13.076
We've had a couple run-ins
like this before.

08:13.618 --> 08:17.455
I always had, like, anger issues, but...

08:17.956 --> 08:20.709
it's just gotten worse.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.755
Like, it's different when you get
into a fight with a female.

08:26.673 --> 08:27.507
I know.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.842
You can play it completely calm

08:28.925 --> 08:31.177
when you done fightin' her
because y'all on the same level.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.846
- I'm a female, you a female.
- Right.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.306
But a dude, you hyperventilate,
you goin' crazy.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.101
'Cause he has power over you.
He can kill you.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.937
- I could have died in there.
- Right.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.938
Of course I'm scared.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.150
Aw, don't cry. It's okay.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.318
That shit is fucked up.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.654
- Don't cry.
- Mm-hmm.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.700
We have a lot of people
that come in

08:53.783 --> 08:55.744
and are arrested for domestic violence.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.664
When you arrive
on a domestic violence scene,

08:59.831 --> 09:04.419
it can be tricky because the person
that's got the scratch marks on 'em

09:04.502 --> 09:08.423
and whatnot,
may have been trying to defend themselves,

09:08.673 --> 09:10.717
uh, or it was actually the perp.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.927
It's very, very difficult to figure out.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.766
You Robinson?
Just stand in the yellow square, please.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.769
All right, can I have your full name
and date of birth?

09:20.852 --> 09:24.647
Brittany Robinson. 7-13-90.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.776
Okay, you're here
on a battery charge.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.153
Your bond amount is $2,400.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.407
- They brought your phone with you?
- It was in the police car.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.328
Um. Right now, you're gonna get
your fingerprints taken.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.872
After that,
you're good to be bonded at any time.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.501
How's somebody's gonna bond me out,
man, when I don't have no number?

09:45.835 --> 09:48.129
How I'm gonna call somebody
to bond me out?

09:49.714 --> 09:53.593
I have a job. I got two kids.
Like, what am I supposed to do, ma'am?

10:01.518 --> 10:04.187
- You have somebody to come?
- I don't have any numbers.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.315
- Well, nobody know you came?
- He broke my phone, so...

10:07.941 --> 10:09.150
You think he'll let 'em know?

10:10.318 --> 10:11.152
No.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.155
That malicious.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.116
- Fabulicious.
- He won't let 'em know.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.118
So y'all just emotional today?

10:18.451 --> 10:20.578
He was cheatin' and I had to leave.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.789
- I don't have time for that.
- Oh yeah, cheating on you?

10:22.872 --> 10:24.499
If you feel like you were wrong,

10:24.582 --> 10:27.627
I mean, you can come up here
to our magistrate court when you get out

10:27.710 --> 10:32.132
and speak to the judge that, you know,
charges should be pressed against <i>him.</i>

10:32.298 --> 10:34.717
- Mm-hmm.
- They're open 24 hours a day up here.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.635
Okay?

10:36.845 --> 10:39.514
Well, we'll see what we can do for you
in a little bit.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.433
Try to think real hard about, um,
some numbers.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.144
I'll think about some numbers now.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.896
Yeah. If you can, just do what you can,
okay?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.523
- Okay.
- All right, you have a good day.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.440
You too.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.573
She said I can get out,
but they just need...

10:57.198 --> 10:58.408
I don't have no numbers.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.745
So I'm up here thinkin' about...
Six, four, one...

11:04.747 --> 11:06.207
Six, four, one.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.435
An inmate can be
in a holding cell for up to 48 hours.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.520
It can be a grueling process,

11:27.604 --> 11:31.149
sitting and just waiting to find out
if you will get a bond,

11:31.232 --> 11:35.153
if a loved one will come
to the jail facility to bond you out,

11:35.445 --> 11:36.988
or if you will get dressed in.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.243
Fuckin' fuck me, man.

11:44.621 --> 11:49.417
Last night, um,
I went out to a... a club.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.920
We met, um, two strippers there.

11:52.837 --> 11:53.671
Um.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.592
I had, uh, a room.
They came back to my room.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.345
I got, uh...

12:01.262 --> 12:05.016
caught up, you know, in, you know,
uh, you know, the sex.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.394
They asked me for $200.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.147
I mean, I told 'em, you know,
that I'm not giving them no money.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.315
I need the money for myself.

12:13.191 --> 12:16.986
Next thing I know,
North Cross PD kicked open the door.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.366
Guns drawn, uh, shields raised, um...

12:21.449 --> 12:24.410
Told me to get on the ground,
put me in handcuffs instantly.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.663
Uh, didn't question me or anything.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.875
The cops took 200 of my dollars

12:30.959 --> 12:34.337
because, allegedly,
that's how much I robbed the person for.

12:34.796 --> 12:40.218
So clearly, the girls told the cops,
"He robbed us or whatever, for $200."

12:40.843 --> 12:43.888
They went right to my book bag
and grabbed my gun.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.974
You know,
so that let me know that, you know,

12:46.057 --> 12:48.851
the girls had told them, you know,
"He has a gun in his book bag."

12:49.352 --> 12:52.647
I have a concealed weapons permit.
I was never asked about that.

12:53.731 --> 12:57.318
So I guess them seeing that weapon
was all that they needed to see.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.903
They didn't ask any questions.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.072
Came in there, locked me up.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.161
Bro, you gotta call
my motherfuckin' people, bro.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.664
They motherfuckin' charged me
with armed robbery, bro.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.582
<i>- Nigga, what?</i>
- Yes!

13:12.083 --> 13:14.043
<i>Oh no, dawg. Hell no.</i>

13:14.127 --> 13:16.129
<i>Uh, this shit wild. What's your bond?</i>

13:16.504 --> 13:20.591
Bro, my bond is, bro, okay,
all right, my bond is 7,000.

13:20.675 --> 13:23.553
I gotta come up with 700 of that.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.930
I got 368, you feel me?

13:26.014 --> 13:27.432
If y'all boys come up with the rest,

13:27.515 --> 13:29.726
I'll make sure y'all have that bread
as soon as I get out.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.643
<i>All right.</i>

13:30.727 --> 13:33.313
Yeah, hell yeah, tell me more,
but I got to get out today.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.441
Remember I got to go to that interview
in the morning. I can't miss that shit.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.358
<i>I get it. Yeah, yeah.</i>

13:42.196 --> 13:43.239
Huh? Hell, yeah.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.075
Yo, I said I'm outta this bitch.

13:48.494 --> 13:52.874
I grew up, you know, rough,
uh, south Florida, on West Palm Beach.

13:53.833 --> 13:58.338
The hood has a way
of sucking the life out of you.

14:00.173 --> 14:03.384
Basketball, that was really my fuel,
you know?

14:03.468 --> 14:06.554
It just...
I had a hunger for that, you know,

14:06.637 --> 14:07.764
so much that, you know,

14:07.847 --> 14:11.392
it... it kept me from a lot of things
that my homeboys were doin'.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.562
I just knew that
that was gonna be my ticket out.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.484
I got, um, a partial scholarship
to Indian River State College,

14:19.817 --> 14:22.111
so I like to say, you know,
I beat the odds.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.073
But still, you know, like I said,

14:25.156 --> 14:27.325
It... it... it's a hard thing to shake,
you know?

14:27.408 --> 14:28.868
Like I say, bein' educated,

14:29.285 --> 14:32.288
still growing up in the hood
and knowing how to do better.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.041
This job is an opportunity, you know,
to get out.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.086
But, you know,
it seems like even if I get out,

14:38.336 --> 14:40.963
you know, the hood, you know,
just draws me back in.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.885
Just wastin' my time, man.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.821
- Yo, man, you look nervous.
- Really?

15:05.488 --> 15:07.323
I just been wired on coffee all day.

15:11.744 --> 15:16.082
I've been here, uh, about 46 times,
uh, in the past 10 years.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.751
All the deputies know me here,
pretty much.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.545
When I leave, they say,
"See you next week."

15:20.628 --> 15:22.713
I've had one officer say,
"You need to quit doin' this.

15:22.797 --> 15:23.881
It's becoming embarrassing."

15:23.965 --> 15:26.634
Yeah, I know, it's becoming embarrassing
for me too. Me most of all.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.513
If I come to jail,
no matter how many times I've been here,

15:30.596 --> 15:32.098
it's simply because I've been drinkin'.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.768
Disorderly conduct
or public intoxication, you know?

15:37.103 --> 15:39.730
I had the choice to receive probation
or do time.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.150
I didn't want probation 'cause
when I get out, you pay fines,

15:42.233 --> 15:44.068
you gotta do
the drug and alcohol evaluation

15:44.152 --> 15:45.528
and it's just, money, money, money.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.614
I don't have that kind of money
because I'm unemployed, I'm on the street.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.033
So, I had to do 60 days total. So...

15:51.534 --> 15:53.953
And I've done my time
and tonight's my release night.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.247
And I'm going back to the street.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.333
Then it's just hanging out on the corners
and staying out of trouble.

15:59.417 --> 16:02.462
Out of sight, out of mind.
Not drinking. Don't drink.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.386
They'll... They'll clock me out
about 12:30 tonight.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.054
Let me get fire, man.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.644
- You'll be all right.
- I'll be all right.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.569
I'm tired of drinkin'.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.112
My dad was an alcoholic for years.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.281
A lot of my family's been alcoholics
all their life,

16:30.364 --> 16:33.826
and my family's took a lot of devastation
and destruction because of it.

16:34.202 --> 16:37.288
I lived with my mother for 30 years.
I was pampered, I was babied.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.040
But my family was jealous of it.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.751
When she came close to her dyin' time,
they took all the possessions,

16:41.834 --> 16:44.587
all the money, cast me to the streets,
said "you're on your own, buddy."

16:44.712 --> 16:48.174
Ever since, I've been on the street, uh,
total time of about 18 years.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.677
You know, I've just reached a point now
where I'm ready to move on.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.514
I'm ready to get things straight
and get things right.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.141
If I'm gonna hold a job,
I gots to quit drinkin'.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.435
I can't hold a job if I'm going to drink.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.647
I don't crave it in here.
Why should I crave it out there?

17:02.730 --> 17:06.150
Simply because I step out the door
and think, "I'm free, I can go have it."

17:06.358 --> 17:09.529
Does that make me want it?
Am I shakin' and jonesin' for it? No.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.406
Have I wanted it, craved it,
thought about it while I'm in here? No.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.618
And if I don't have to have it in here,
why should I have it out there?

17:16.993 --> 17:17.828
So...

17:21.540 --> 17:24.085
There are inmates
that constantly keep coming back.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.045
You're seein' their face
over and over again.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.340
And it's frustrating at times
to see the same person

17:29.715 --> 17:32.510
who said they're gonna get it right
this time and they keep coming back

17:32.593 --> 17:33.636
and they keep coming back.

17:40.643 --> 17:44.313
Oh, my God, I'm so excited to go home.

17:48.359 --> 17:50.152
This is my fifth time
being in Gwinnett County.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.113
I should not have been here <i>one </i> time.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.156
Are you ready?

17:54.657 --> 17:55.491
- Yes.
- You are?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.285
- Are you happy to see your mom?
- Yes.

17:57.368 --> 18:00.454
- Is she gonna have that food for you?
- My mom gonna have that food cooked.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.957
My mom makin' some monkey bread.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.128
All I have right now is my mom.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.338
All the friends that I have do meth.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.841
It's like I just keep going back
to the same people,

18:11.924 --> 18:13.718
to the same drugs, to the same thing,

18:13.801 --> 18:16.012
thinkin' that it's gonna get better
and it's not.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.180
And it... I don't know.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.474
It's breakin' everybody's heart
that cares about me.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.602
Taylor, the pressure's on now.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.979
I know. Too many people wanna see me
do good, honestly.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.315
- For real.
- Mm-hmm. Keep your head right.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.568
- Stick with positive thoughts.
- Always.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.695
When I get outta here, I'm going to rehab.

18:32.945 --> 18:37.825
I've learned that you can't accomplish
anything until you start your recovery.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.036
- I'm gonna get out and do right.
- I wish you luck.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.204
A lot of people sit here and say
they wanna get clean,

18:42.288 --> 18:43.831
wanna get clean, wanna get clean.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.958
But you know, in the end,
it's just jail talk

18:46.042 --> 18:49.629
because you know you're gonna get out
and do the same shit unless you get help.

18:51.088 --> 18:54.675
I can only try my hardest
to stay away from the stuff.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.096
But I mean, it's inevitable
that I'm gonna come upon it at some point.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.389
Even if I don't mean to.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.518
And it's like I can't mess up anymore.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.772
You better be good.
I'm tellin' you.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.038
Broke my phone.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.207
Oh God, I don't know what to do now.

19:28.376 --> 19:32.129
My phone is crushed.
I'm not good with numbers.

19:33.047 --> 19:35.299
What am I gonna do?

19:35.883 --> 19:37.593
I think I know somebody to ring.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.265
So, I called every bonding company
that came up on that screen.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.685
Like, kind of trying to catch the...
catch it.

19:45.976 --> 19:46.894
Eight one one.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.063
- Four four six what?
- Nine seven four five.

19:49.146 --> 19:52.483
Hi, uh, my name is, uh,
Brittany Robinson, um.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.026
I've never been to jail before.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.487
I'm trying to get in touch
with my mother,

19:56.570 --> 19:58.531
and I'm horrible at phone numbers.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.908
She, and she just recently changed
her phone number.

20:00.991 --> 20:05.204
Is it any way that you could use
my email address or anything?

20:05.413 --> 20:07.540
I called everyone.
They said the same thing.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.251
"Hey, if you can get in touch
with your mom,

20:10.334 --> 20:11.836
have her give us a call."

20:12.128 --> 20:15.631
I need somebody to get in touch
with my mom.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.802
Mom, I know you won't ask her.
Tell her, I'm asking her.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.515
Do you happen to have access
to, like, an internet?

20:24.598 --> 20:25.433
Uh-huh.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.436
- Could you ask her to look up something?
- Hey Mom, will you do something for me?

20:28.519 --> 20:29.562
Please.

20:29.645 --> 20:33.357
Okay, this girl here can't...
don't have no contact with her family.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.401
You know?
Can you look up something for her?

20:35.735 --> 20:39.238
Actually, one of my cellmates,
she called her mom,

20:39.321 --> 20:41.240
and she called a lady that knew my mom

20:41.532 --> 20:43.576
and she gave me my mom's number.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.245
And I carved it in with my nails
on a piece of paper.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.038
And I called my mom.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.331
Hello?

20:50.124 --> 20:50.958
Hello?

20:51.083 --> 20:53.335
Hey, Mom. I'm in jail.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.130
You know, I'm sad.

21:09.977 --> 21:14.190
I have 13 hours left, uh,
until my, uh, job interview.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.693
I really need a break, you know,
in my life,

21:17.777 --> 21:20.988
so in the next 13 hours, I'm just praying
that, you know, that...

21:21.113 --> 21:25.242
my family, you know, my friends, you know,
are able, you know, to get those $300.

21:25.576 --> 21:29.038
You know, so I can start, you know,

21:29.121 --> 21:32.291
puttin' the pieces of my life, you know,
back together again.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.003
Going through this right now,

21:36.086 --> 21:40.257
I can't, you know, stop thinkin'
about my, my ex-girlfriend.

21:40.674 --> 21:44.178
<i>She... She's been my number one supporter,
and...</i>

21:44.845 --> 21:48.682
<i>I can't stop thinkin' about what...
what she thinks about all this right now,</i>

21:48.766 --> 21:50.768
<i>because I... I... I feel like I need her.</i>

21:55.397 --> 21:58.776
She's gonna trip, man.
But I'm gonna call. I'm gonna call her.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.031
- Hey.
<i>- You okay?</i>

22:04.824 --> 22:07.535
I am, you know, but I'm not, you know?

22:07.618 --> 22:10.454
I don't want you to feel like
I'm always messin' up

22:10.538 --> 22:12.832
'cause you know, like,
you know, I'm trying to...

22:12.915 --> 22:14.208
<i>What's wrong with your phone?</i>

22:14.708 --> 22:15.835
I'm gonna get to that.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.796
See, this is not my fault, but...

22:20.047 --> 22:21.048
I'm in jail.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.425
I got charged with armed robbery.

22:23.551 --> 22:26.470
<i>- Are you serious?</i>
- Yeah, and I didn't even do anything.

22:26.554 --> 22:29.974
- I was in the hotel asleep.
<i>- You didn't have no gun on you?</i>

22:30.307 --> 22:31.141
Huh?

22:31.475 --> 22:33.602
<i>Did you have a gun on you
in the room?</i>

22:33.936 --> 22:34.770
Uh-uh.

22:35.104 --> 22:38.732
Marsha, they kicked open the door.
I'm talkin' about shields, guns drawn.

22:38.816 --> 22:44.446
<i>Okay, but you know that this country
is not for us, so just fuck all that.</i>

22:44.530 --> 22:45.865
<i>Just fuck what you did.</i>

22:45.948 --> 22:48.492
<i>It's about what they say you did.
Fuck all that.</i>

22:48.868 --> 22:49.702
Yeah.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.456
You think about me bein'
a college educated person, you know?

22:54.540 --> 22:58.627
Why would I even want to mess
with strippers?

22:59.086 --> 23:02.089
Doing right all of the time, um,

23:03.048 --> 23:04.216
it, it's a tough thing.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.517
I been through this process
so many times

23:13.601 --> 23:16.020
I could tell them the whole routine,
man, beginning to end.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.064
Been on the street here
in Lawrenceville about ten years.

23:19.148 --> 23:21.483
And it's just been survival on the street.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.321
- Who gave you all this?
- Other people just left 'em.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.949
Lot of people going home this past month,
so I just kept it.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.868
And I didn't throw it away,
I just kept it.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.244
I need it for showers.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.998
- Day shift said I could take it with me.
- They didn't tell me about it.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.499
Oh. Oh, I don't know.

23:45.591 --> 23:46.425
Shit.

23:48.302 --> 23:49.219
Make a right.

23:49.303 --> 23:52.389
I got to... There's a few things
I gotta do when I get out of here.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.351
But you gotta stay straight,
you gotta stay sober, you gotta work.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.189
When you're done, put the bags
and flip flops in the garbage.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.107
- Toss the dirty clothes in the bag.
- All right.

24:02.900 --> 24:06.403
What can I do this time when I get out
in order to not come back again?

24:10.199 --> 24:12.493
The main thing's just not drink
when I get out.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.834
It's good to be back out, you know?

24:20.918 --> 24:22.711
It's just...
I don't want to come back again.

24:25.798 --> 24:26.632
I feel better.

24:26.924 --> 24:29.093
I've been in there 45 days
taking hot showers,

24:29.176 --> 24:30.302
and my body's clean.

24:30.511 --> 24:33.430
I got to get some clean clothes on,
but I feel... I feel a lot better.

24:34.723 --> 24:38.310
As far as releasing
of an inmate, for some, it can be tough.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.814
The inmate is probably thinking,
I've become so familiar

24:41.897 --> 24:45.484
with the setting here,
getting my meals and laundry.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.778
You know,
I get a clean uniform twice a week.

24:47.861 --> 24:50.572
All of that's
being taken care of by the jail facility.

24:50.656 --> 24:53.450
You're getting out in the world and you
don't know how you'll survive.

24:53.534 --> 24:54.702
What do... What do I do?

24:56.120 --> 24:57.246
Oh, a cigarette.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.332
What can a homeless person have
coming out of jail?

25:00.833 --> 25:02.376
I'm holding on to what I got left,

25:02.459 --> 25:04.086
which ain't much,
but I'm holding on to it.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.005
Thank you. Appreciate it.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.048
I'm dry as a bone.

25:08.924 --> 25:12.094
It's not too late to make a better life
'cause I can do it. I know I can.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.565
Mother.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.777
Please come get me, mother.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.948
You need somebody to call
the bondsman company. I don't know.

25:33.824 --> 25:36.869
Nah, they're not letting me
sign myself out of here.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.790
All right. Okay.

25:46.545 --> 25:50.883
My mom said
she's calling some bail bondsmen

25:52.092 --> 25:53.635
and she's about to get me out.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.764
I'm just playing the waiting game
as of this point.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.603
All right, ladies, listen up.

26:02.686 --> 26:03.979
- Robinson, Brittany?
- Yeah.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.356
You gotta get dressed in.
You're approaching your time.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.817
- We can only keep you down here for 48.
- Okay.

26:23.332 --> 26:25.876
Everything that you are wearing

26:25.959 --> 26:29.088
is gonna go inside a clear plastic bag
to be stored.

26:29.505 --> 26:32.091
So by the time you're done,
you're completely naked.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.092
Go for it.

26:40.182 --> 26:43.268
Me being here?
It's not worth it.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.523
It is not worth your time

26:48.190 --> 26:51.318
and your money and your energy
to be locked up in a place

26:51.401 --> 26:53.487
because you can't get your life together.

26:53.821 --> 26:56.073
Like, if there's something in your life

26:56.156 --> 26:59.409
that's gonna provoke you
or put you in a toxic situation,

26:59.493 --> 27:01.620
you just have to remove yourself
completely

27:01.703 --> 27:03.163
and just stay away from that.

27:03.789 --> 27:07.376
Right now, I'm so tired.
Ow, shit.

27:31.316 --> 27:34.486
What's my fear?
That I'm not gonna recover.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.534
I'm super excited to go to this rehab
and everything,

27:40.617 --> 27:44.663
but I'm fearful of the unknown,
of what's gonna happen.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.586
<i>I'm just scared that I'm not going to have
the courage to say no.</i>

27:51.628 --> 27:54.756
Give that to me.
All right. And you're good to go.

27:54.840 --> 27:55.799
Okay, thanks.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.719
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.390
- Oh.
- Oh.

28:04.266 --> 28:06.435
- I love you.
- I love you too.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.271
- Come on.
- Where'd you get that ugly jacket?

28:10.564 --> 28:12.441
That's so rude.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.651
- You smell good.
- Thank you.

28:14.735 --> 28:15.777
I smell like crap.

28:16.528 --> 28:17.529
You smell like jail.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.406
I know, right? You got a lighter?

28:19.698 --> 28:22.242
- Not on me. In the truck.
- Oh, okay.

28:27.331 --> 28:30.167
- And off to my new life I go.
- Okay.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.794
- I hope you mean it, girl.
- For real.

28:53.482 --> 28:57.819
Man, I just need a fucking bond, man,
to get my ass out of this shit, man.

29:01.031 --> 29:06.954
My goal is eight o'clock to be dressed,
mind clear, um,

29:07.079 --> 29:08.956
and ready, you know,
to tackle my interview.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.499
But that's how you feel,

29:10.582 --> 29:13.502
like you ain't gonna never make it
out of this shit, so just try to...

29:14.878 --> 29:15.712
make it through.

29:18.548 --> 29:20.717
- Yo, yo.
<i>- What's good?</i>

29:21.009 --> 29:23.762
What it look like my boy,
my, my, my people sent that yet?

29:23.845 --> 29:25.847
<i>We gotta go link up with Brody's sister.</i>

29:25.931 --> 29:28.684
<i>She got the pay stubs. We ain't got
no pay stubs or nothing like that.</i>

29:28.809 --> 29:30.769
Golly, they makin' a nigga do all that?

29:30.852 --> 29:32.980
<i>We can't bond you out
unless we have a job.</i>

29:33.355 --> 29:34.481
Oh, damn.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.692
<i>Hey, what time your interview at
in the morning?</i>

29:36.775 --> 29:38.568
Nine, but I need you to be here like eight

29:38.652 --> 29:41.738
because I might have to run
and get some shoes, like, I ain't...

29:42.030 --> 29:43.949
Like, I might have to run
and get some shoes.

29:44.533 --> 29:45.701
<i>I can lend you some shoes.</i>

29:46.493 --> 29:47.953
Yeah. Well, good luck.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.038
<i>- You gonna be out soon, dawg.</i>
- All right.

29:50.247 --> 29:51.415
<i>- All right, cool.</i>
- Yeah.

30:03.677 --> 30:06.054
I had to explain to people
what monkey bread was.

30:06.555 --> 30:07.389
Oh, really?

30:09.766 --> 30:10.976
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.811
- It's really good.
- Yeah?

30:14.730 --> 30:16.064
So, what's your plan,

30:17.858 --> 30:19.318
when you get out of rehab?

30:19.860 --> 30:21.445
At least have a good job

30:21.528 --> 30:23.864
that, say, I'd have
for at least two months

30:24.448 --> 30:26.408
and be out of there by Christmas.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.288
'Cause I can't move too fast or I'll fall.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.832
- Yeah.
- I can't.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.461
- Yes.
- If I started moving too fast...

30:38.920 --> 30:41.590
Yeah, look how many times
you fell in the past two years.

30:41.673 --> 30:42.507
Oh, I know.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.677
It's kind of surreal.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.679
I mean, she's got 60 days clean.

30:47.763 --> 30:52.184
This is the most time she's had clean
in two years.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.395
So, I'm really fearful.

30:55.937 --> 31:00.067
I can't wait for Monday to get here,
so that she can be in rehab.

31:01.026 --> 31:01.985
It's been rough.

31:02.903 --> 31:08.575
I mean, I've spent the past two years
chasing her all over Metro Atlanta.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.036
You said you had pictures
of the place?

31:11.119 --> 31:12.287
- What place?
- Rehab.

31:12.871 --> 31:17.793
I mean, I love my daughter dearly,
but this drug has ravaged her brain.

31:18.668 --> 31:21.296
She is not the same person I raised.

31:21.797 --> 31:25.384
I mean, I'm just hopeful.
That's all I can be.

31:28.345 --> 31:29.596
Oh, that's cute.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.349
So, what do you think?

31:33.517 --> 31:36.311
- Doesn't seem like a horrible place.
- Yeah, right?

31:36.895 --> 31:37.729
Could be worse.

31:38.438 --> 31:39.815
You got really lucky, girl.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.859
- Yeah. I know.
- Take full advantage of it.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.861
I actually will.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.280
I mean, it looks like
it's a pretty big house,

31:47.364 --> 31:51.201
so I mean, there has to be at least
ten to fifteen girls.

31:51.701 --> 31:52.536
Probably.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.788
Hopefully they're nice.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.917
Hopefully I'm nice.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.795
Yeah, that's... I was...
I was thinking the same thing.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.797
I hope you're going to be nice too.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.799
Ah, one can only hope.

32:06.633 --> 32:07.509
Jeez.

32:19.146 --> 32:20.981
Any spare change
for a homeless man?

32:21.064 --> 32:23.108
- Do you want a cigarette?
- Yeah, actually, I'm flat...

32:23.191 --> 32:24.943
I got out of jail about an hour ago

32:25.068 --> 32:27.446
and I'm flat damn broke out here
trying to panhandle.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.156
Appreciate it, man.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.867
I got a light. I don't mean to be a bum.
I'm sorry, man.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.370
<i>I need money.
I don't have a penny to my name.</i>

32:35.454 --> 32:37.539
<i>I gotta replace my clothes,
on my hygiene.</i>

32:37.622 --> 32:39.040
<i>I gotta be able to buy food.</i>

32:39.666 --> 32:41.918
<i>And I gotta be able to wash my clothes
when I have clothes.</i>

32:42.002 --> 32:43.086
<i>Everything takes money.</i>

32:43.795 --> 32:45.630
You don't have no job to go to?

32:45.714 --> 32:48.550
Well, I gotta talk to some people first
about getting into a place.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.427
I got a boarding house
I might try to get into.

32:50.510 --> 32:53.513
I can get work, it's just
I gotta get off the street for when...

32:53.597 --> 32:55.140
I'm on the street right now.

32:55.265 --> 32:57.517
- Good luck. I gotta go. Good luck.
- All right.

33:00.604 --> 33:02.772
<i>My name's William Fouts,
locally well known.</i>

33:03.732 --> 33:05.859
<i>Everybody in this town knows me,
everybody does.</i>

33:07.944 --> 33:11.448
You drinkin' some goddamned water.
Let me get a beer.

33:11.573 --> 33:14.201
- Yeah, I'm... I'm homeless on the street.
- Damn, son.

33:14.534 --> 33:15.744
- I've been on the...
- Get a beer.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.162
I've been on the street a long...

33:17.245 --> 33:19.956
Man, this Shorty man,
everybody buy Shorty a brew.

33:20.123 --> 33:23.001
I've been on the street a long time.
I ain't changed my clothes in a month.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.670
- You got some money.
- He ain't changed his clothes in a month.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.673
- Yeah, no shit.
- You buy him a goddamn beer, ya hear me?

33:28.757 --> 33:30.509
Hey, man, I appreciate it. God bless you.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.719
- Appreciate it. Thank you.
- All right, bro.

33:42.771 --> 33:46.441
<i>All I want is a beer and a cigarette.
I've been... I did 45 days in there.</i>

33:50.028 --> 33:51.404
<i>Hello, how are you doin'?</i>

33:53.657 --> 33:56.451
<i>- That will be all for today, I guess.
- Three sixty-nine.</i>

33:56.660 --> 33:58.328
<i>Three sixty-nine, sir.</i>

33:58.954 --> 34:00.747
Little isolated spot back here.

34:01.498 --> 34:02.707
This will do just fine.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.459
I've come here many times.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.836
It's a place to chill and drink a beer.
That's about it.

34:07.337 --> 34:09.547
It's been a long 45 days.
I want a cold beer.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.466
I live on the street. I drink beer.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.467
<i>I'm free.
No probation, no charges, no nothin'.</i>

34:13.552 --> 34:15.929
Free to do anything I want
as long as I stay out of trouble.

34:16.263 --> 34:17.639
We all got choices to make.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.398
I need to quit smokin' and drinkin'.
It's been a problem.

34:26.481 --> 34:27.940
But, hey, uh, one problem at a time.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.782
You could not even imagine
what I've been through.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.659
My father was an alcoholic
all his life.

34:38.952 --> 34:42.371
He'd come home in a roarin' drunk,
roarin'... like a roarin' tiger.

34:42.455 --> 34:43.956
You know? One of those types of drunks.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.085
And then my mom shot him in the stomach
with a 22-caliber rifle

34:47.168 --> 34:48.920
when he come home too drunk one night.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.469
He will leave you nor dew nor rain.

34:57.846 --> 35:01.057
You would not even see a piece of dew
on a flower in the morning.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.394
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

35:05.145 --> 35:07.188
Just smell the coffee, United States,
that's all.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.482
You're not blind, not deaf,

35:09.566 --> 35:11.901
then wake up
and smell the goddamn fuckin' coffee then!

35:11.985 --> 35:12.861
It's that simple!

35:13.987 --> 35:16.114
No pissing me off either
'cause I ain't in the mood.

35:17.324 --> 35:19.743
I gotta quit drinkin' and smokin'
and get my shit straight.

35:19.826 --> 35:20.785
Who am I to preach?

35:21.953 --> 35:24.164
The Bible says in the last days,
everybody's gonna say,

35:24.247 --> 35:27.500
"Oh, that's not going to come
for a thousand years from now." Uh, wrong.

35:28.668 --> 35:32.172
Can you count the sands of grain
of sand in an hourglass?

35:35.425 --> 35:36.384
No, you cannot.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.387
Any more than you can count the number
of sands on a beach.

35:40.639 --> 35:44.517
Nobody think about you
because if you're afraid to talk about...

35:45.060 --> 35:47.646
- Morris.
- Woo-hoo.

35:48.521 --> 35:51.483
- Hey, man, y'all boys keep yours heads on.
- You do the same.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.361
Up to the door that says,
"Dress Out Release."

35:59.824 --> 36:02.911
And these are your copies. They said
that you would be going to superior court.

36:02.994 --> 36:06.414
You'll be notified by mail
in that address that you gave me earlier.

36:06.956 --> 36:07.791
What time is it?

36:08.416 --> 36:10.418
- It's 1:12.
- 1:12.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.381
Seven hours.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.428
<i>If I can get this opportunity,
it can greatly change my life</i>

36:20.512 --> 36:22.722
<i>to where I won't be
in situations like this anymore.</i>

36:23.014 --> 36:24.891
<i>But the main thing I worry about...</i>

36:25.016 --> 36:27.185
<i>What if when they run
that background check,</i>

36:27.268 --> 36:29.979
<i>this charge appears
and I don't get the job</i>

36:30.063 --> 36:31.564
<i>and I haven't even been convicted?</i>

36:32.148 --> 36:36.194
<i>I refuse to just let my smarts
and everything I've fought for in my life,</i>

36:36.319 --> 36:38.321
<i>to let this be it for me.</i>

36:40.490 --> 36:42.575
I'm outta this!

36:42.659 --> 36:43.993
Fuck that...

36:45.412 --> 36:47.080
- Fuck that shit!
- All right!

36:47.622 --> 36:50.750
Took a nigga's shoes. Feel me?
I'm out here with no shoes.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.544
- Feel me?
- Yeah, I got it.

36:54.087 --> 36:57.132
Finally, boy. Argh.

37:29.998 --> 37:33.585
I have never been to jail,
but I don't want to feel like no failure.

37:33.668 --> 37:37.255
Like, I have goals. I do work, you know?

37:37.464 --> 37:38.673
I'm a good mother.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.359
Good, good. Good to see you.

37:58.443 --> 38:01.404
<i>I'm really excited about starting
this new chapter in my life.</i>

38:01.488 --> 38:05.366
<i>Don't ever think that just because
you've hit rock bottom,</i>

38:05.450 --> 38:06.993
<i>that you can't climb back up.</i>

38:07.619 --> 38:08.661
<i>Change is possible.</i>

38:10.538 --> 38:14.292
- Oh. I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

38:36.898 --> 38:39.275
I've been counting down for days now.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.614
Had this day planned out to the tee.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.452
Turn the fuckin' wheel to the right!

38:49.536 --> 38:52.622
My girlfriend. Be happy to see her.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.791
Julia, turn the goddamn wheel!

38:54.874 --> 38:56.668
You're sitting here cussing at me
for nothing.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.294
Because you're not doing shit!

39:00.088 --> 39:01.965
I'm gonna be in heaven for a little bit.
