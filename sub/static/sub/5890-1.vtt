As powerful men always have,

00:07.479 --> 00:09.946
we're going to engineer
an event to shape

00:09.948 --> 00:12.382
the destiny of our country.

00:12.384 --> 00:19.355
And you'll get your war
and I'll get my office.

00:19.357 --> 00:21.317
It's time we took
this country back.

01:19.750 --> 01:20.883
There are no codes.

01:20.885 --> 01:22.752
I'm telling you
there are no codes.

01:22.754 --> 01:23.786
I swear to you.

01:23.788 --> 01:25.288
There... there's a
new security system.

01:25.290 --> 01:26.622
It's all very high tech.

01:31.462 --> 01:34.864
You have wax in
your ears, fat man?

01:34.866 --> 01:37.266
You keep your face
superglued to the floor

01:37.268 --> 01:38.234
or I'm going to blow it off.

01:38.236 --> 01:42.071
Hey, back down.

01:56.720 --> 01:57.687
Watch him.

01:57.689 --> 01:58.809
He's your responsibility.

02:02.626 --> 02:03.626
What?

02:12.803 --> 02:14.804
Huh, this is new.

02:14.806 --> 02:15.806
Get the manager.

02:21.245 --> 02:22.211
Just close your eyes.

02:22.213 --> 02:23.212
Listen to mommy.

02:23.214 --> 02:24.380
Listen to mommy's voice.

02:24.382 --> 02:25.681
It's going to be OK.

02:25.683 --> 02:29.652
OK, just close your eyes.

02:29.654 --> 02:33.589
Nobody move.

02:33.591 --> 02:35.191
Where are you going?
Huh?

02:35.193 --> 02:36.313
Where are you taking me?

02:40.531 --> 02:42.498
Please, you don't
need these people.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.500
Let them go.

02:44.502 --> 02:46.469
Please.

02:46.471 --> 02:47.470
What are you try to do?

02:47.472 --> 02:48.471
Nobody moved.

02:48.473 --> 02:51.440
Settle down.

02:51.442 --> 02:52.408
How do we open it?

02:52.410 --> 02:54.010
You can't open it.

02:54.012 --> 02:55.044
There has to be a key.

02:55.046 --> 02:55.845
There's no key.

02:55.847 --> 02:58.247
I swear it.

02:58.249 --> 03:01.651
It's... it's me.

03:01.653 --> 03:02.451
It's me.

03:02.453 --> 03:03.386
I'm the key.

03:03.388 --> 03:05.788
Kill him.

03:05.790 --> 03:06.756
Move.

03:06.758 --> 03:08.324
I'm not going to ask you again.

03:08.326 --> 03:11.928
If you shoot me, you'll
never get it open.

03:14.898 --> 03:15.898
No, no, no, no.

03:16.834 --> 03:17.733
Quiet.

03:17.735 --> 03:19.302
Please, just let me go.

03:19.304 --> 03:20.169
I said quiet.

03:20.171 --> 03:21.504
Please, just let me...

03:21.506 --> 03:22.471
- Quiet.
- Just let me go.

03:22.473 --> 03:23.306
Just let me...

03:23.308 --> 03:24.273
Don't make me tell you again.

03:24.275 --> 03:25.942
Shut up, motherfucker.

03:25.944 --> 03:26.742
Shut up.

03:26.744 --> 03:28.744
Shut your fucking mouth.

03:28.746 --> 03:33.182
Shut your fucking face,
you piece of shit.

03:33.184 --> 03:35.718
Mommy.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.854
Shh, shh, shh, shh, don't worry.

03:38.856 --> 03:39.822
He's just sleeping.

03:39.824 --> 03:40.824
Now get in.

03:56.707 --> 03:58.207
I thought you were the key.

03:58.209 --> 03:59.775
I... I... I don't
know what happened.

03:59.777 --> 04:02.578
I swear to you, I don't know.

04:02.580 --> 04:03.580
Get the teeth.

04:15.058 --> 04:17.026
Oh, unbelievable.

04:17.028 --> 04:18.027
Don't even bother.

04:18.029 --> 04:20.529
It's closed.

04:20.531 --> 04:22.531
No, no.

04:24.535 --> 04:25.801
The hell is that?

04:29.006 --> 04:31.507
Get in.

04:31.509 --> 04:32.549
Now this better work.

04:51.161 --> 04:51.961
Time?

04:51.963 --> 04:53.429
Two minutes nine.

04:56.466 --> 04:57.466
Give me the numbers.

04:57.468 --> 04:59.435
Three, five, nine, November.

05:11.882 --> 05:12.882
Hang on.

05:31.702 --> 05:36.138
No, no, no, no, no, I saw that.

05:36.140 --> 05:38.074
I saw you move.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.408
Do you wanna die?

05:39.410 --> 05:40.943
Do you think you're that fast?

05:40.945 --> 05:42.378
What are you, Dirty Harry?

05:42.380 --> 05:43.779
You feel lucky?

05:43.781 --> 05:46.716
You're gonna make my day or tell
me to get off my fucking lawn?

05:46.718 --> 05:47.717
No?

05:47.719 --> 05:51.620
Now, don't fucking move.

06:10.974 --> 06:14.009
Do you like this, you
miserable rat fuck?

06:14.011 --> 06:15.444
The guy's jacked up.

06:15.446 --> 06:16.479
The guy is fine.

06:16.481 --> 06:18.547
Get the bag.

06:18.549 --> 06:20.649
He was going for his gun.
We took his gun.

06:20.651 --> 06:22.084
He is not threat.
It's time to go.

06:22.086 --> 06:23.352
- You got the stuff?
- Yes.

06:23.354 --> 06:24.854
I'm just going to blow
this shit's head off.

06:24.856 --> 06:26.889
You know my rules.

06:26.891 --> 06:27.891
Really?

06:32.162 --> 06:33.996
Let's go.

06:33.998 --> 06:36.766
Let's move out.

06:36.768 --> 06:39.235
Your fucking rules.

06:50.180 --> 06:52.181
Fuck you.

06:52.183 --> 06:53.182
You fucking shot me.

06:53.184 --> 06:54.617
You're gonna die.

07:17.974 --> 07:19.041
Now there's seven seconds.

07:19.043 --> 07:21.977
We're late.

07:21.979 --> 07:22.845
Come on, come on.

07:22.847 --> 07:24.180
You've been compromised.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.102
Take care of business
and let's go.

07:30.420 --> 07:31.500
They're all witnesses.

07:36.693 --> 07:38.160
What are you waiting for?

07:38.162 --> 07:39.295
They saw your face.

07:45.902 --> 07:46.902
Let's go.

07:49.606 --> 07:50.606
Motherfucker.

08:04.387 --> 08:06.355
Pick up the trash.

08:06.357 --> 08:07.357
Thank you.

08:17.601 --> 08:18.601
Bloody hell.

08:22.405 --> 08:25.407
You killed Wayne,
you daft cock trough.

08:25.409 --> 08:26.475
Now we got the heat on us.

08:26.477 --> 08:27.743
You should have
backed him up and let

08:27.745 --> 08:29.178
kill that bleeding guard.

08:29.180 --> 08:30.613
He's seen your face
now, hasn't he?

08:30.615 --> 08:32.147
And he's not dead now, is he?

08:32.149 --> 08:33.749
It was my call.

08:33.751 --> 08:35.017
Piss on your call.

08:35.019 --> 08:37.520
Your call makes a more
dangerous situation for me.

08:37.522 --> 08:39.355
And I don't like dangerous
situations for me.

08:39.357 --> 08:41.789
Hey, we're going to get heat
because Wayne, your fucking

08:41.792 --> 08:43.025
guy, was high and you know it.

08:43.027 --> 08:43.926
Excuse me.

08:43.928 --> 08:45.394
Excuse me, did I ask you?

08:45.396 --> 08:48.330
Did I say, hey, ass bag,
what's on your wee mind?

08:48.332 --> 08:51.667
Shut up and get changed.

08:51.669 --> 08:53.536
Gonna give me an
explanation or not?

08:53.538 --> 08:54.470
None are needed.

08:54.472 --> 08:55.738
Fuck you say.

08:55.740 --> 08:57.373
You have dropped us
knee deep into shite

08:57.375 --> 08:58.674
and there's no telling
how many people

08:58.676 --> 08:59.708
saw your face back there.

08:59.710 --> 09:00.709
Let it go.

09:00.711 --> 09:03.546
I am not warning
you again, Fancy.

09:03.548 --> 09:04.780
God almighty, I
can't believe who

09:04.782 --> 09:06.949
I'm in with, a fucking
retard and a stupid gee who

09:06.951 --> 09:11.053
can't even...

09:26.503 --> 09:29.471
I'll have everything
off shore in a month.

09:29.473 --> 09:31.974
30 grand each.

09:31.976 --> 09:33.809
What about Wayne's 30?

09:33.811 --> 09:35.711
He's not using it.

09:35.713 --> 09:38.781
Yeah, you really sound
like you miss him.

09:38.783 --> 09:40.282
Just lay low for a month.

09:40.284 --> 09:41.350
You'll get the rest of your cut.

09:41.352 --> 09:43.619
I better had.

09:43.621 --> 09:44.420
When haven't you?

09:44.422 --> 09:45.621
Huh?

09:45.623 --> 09:47.590
We ever screw you?

09:47.592 --> 09:48.490
Yeah, I didn't think so.

09:48.492 --> 09:51.961
So just shut your face for 30.

09:51.963 --> 09:54.096
Don't much like waiting.

09:54.098 --> 09:55.098
Get a hobby.

10:01.304 --> 10:04.340
30 days, then I come
looking for you... and you.

10:13.450 --> 10:15.985
Hey, what, I... I'm
burned here too, you know.

10:15.987 --> 10:18.454
Nobody saw your face and
I shot that dumb prick.

10:18.456 --> 10:21.757
So if I get popped, I go down
for the job and a murder.

10:21.759 --> 10:23.492
I couldn't have done any
of this without you, Alex.

10:23.494 --> 10:25.461
Don't fucking go there.

10:25.463 --> 10:26.595
I was out.

10:26.597 --> 10:28.397
I should have let you
get me involved in this.

10:28.399 --> 10:30.265
I told you never to
contact me again.

10:30.267 --> 10:31.867
Hey, I... I helped
you disappear.

10:31.869 --> 10:32.801
You owe me.

10:32.803 --> 10:34.269
I don't owe you shit.

10:34.271 --> 10:35.137
These guys are connected.

10:35.139 --> 10:37.439
This thing goes really high up.

10:37.441 --> 10:38.774
And you trust them?

10:38.776 --> 10:42.011
No, but I've got
an insurance policy.

10:42.013 --> 10:43.178
She's flying in tonight.

10:50.220 --> 10:53.255
So this is how things
are going to go.

10:54.725 --> 10:57.393
I'm going to get drunk,
soak in a tub for a couple,

10:57.395 --> 11:01.563
and you are going to get me
the hell out of the country

11:01.565 --> 11:02.931
by tomorrow night.

11:02.933 --> 11:05.167
I've got you set up in town.

11:05.169 --> 11:07.770
Our old place.

11:07.772 --> 11:11.407
Come on, you used
to love it there.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.208
I don't remember any complaints.

11:13.210 --> 11:14.210
I have a few now.

11:19.482 --> 11:21.050
The bag.

11:21.052 --> 11:23.052
I got to hang on
to this until I...

11:23.054 --> 11:26.321
I'm not taking it, jeez.

11:26.323 --> 11:28.157
You look like shit, by the way.

11:28.159 --> 11:31.393
I guess you've knocked
the wind out of me.

11:31.395 --> 11:32.661
Consider these an advance.

12:13.770 --> 12:15.537
Reports
say one of the four thieves

12:15.539 --> 12:18.807
was shot and killed by a
member of his own gang.

12:18.809 --> 12:20.876
Police have an eye
witness, but no description

12:20.878 --> 12:23.545
of the perpetrators has
been released as of yet.

12:23.547 --> 12:25.514
We'll bring you updates
as they come in.

12:25.516 --> 12:27.216
Three
has discovered that the eye

12:27.218 --> 12:29.184
witness has described
to police the killer

12:29.186 --> 12:31.019
of the fourth gunman.

12:31.021 --> 12:33.655
In a CBN exclusive, we
have obtained the police

12:33.657 --> 12:35.591
sketch of that suspect.

12:35.593 --> 12:36.859
I'm Peter...

12:42.533 --> 12:43.533
That's better.

14:08.318 --> 14:09.218
Locked yourself out?

14:09.220 --> 14:10.752
Uh, yeah.

14:10.754 --> 14:12.554
I can take you
to the front desk.

14:12.556 --> 14:14.489
They'll issue the new key card.

14:14.491 --> 14:16.458
Um, uh, no, no need.

14:16.460 --> 14:17.492
Uh, my husband's inside.

14:17.494 --> 14:20.863
He's just a heavy sleeper.

14:20.865 --> 14:24.032
Darling, there you are.

14:24.034 --> 14:25.868
Was she wandering
around the hotel again?

14:25.870 --> 14:26.668
She does that.

14:26.670 --> 14:27.636
Thanks for bringing her home.

14:27.638 --> 14:28.503
No problem.

14:28.505 --> 14:29.771
You folks have a nice evening.

14:33.309 --> 14:34.910
I like this.

14:34.912 --> 14:35.811
What?

14:35.813 --> 14:39.081
The hair, it's good.

14:39.083 --> 14:41.416
And I love the green eyes.

14:41.418 --> 14:45.654
Yeah, the blue was a
bit... I don't know... cold.

14:49.692 --> 14:52.928
Why did you leave me
standing out there?

14:52.930 --> 14:56.431
Sorry, I was in the bathroom.

14:56.433 --> 14:58.700
Thanks for getting
dressed, by the way.

14:58.702 --> 15:01.203
I thought it was an emergency.

15:01.205 --> 15:02.571
It is.

15:02.573 --> 15:04.072
Yeah, well, then, you better
tell me I'm getting out of here

15:04.074 --> 15:06.441
tonight.

15:06.443 --> 15:07.743
No.

15:07.745 --> 15:11.580
But you know that insurance
I was telling you about?

15:11.582 --> 15:14.483
I think I may have found
something even better.

15:14.485 --> 15:18.720
But I'm going to need
your talents to unlock it.

15:18.722 --> 15:21.323
I'm not making this up.

15:21.325 --> 15:26.161
Look, I may have lied to
you about a lot of things,

15:26.163 --> 15:28.230
but not something this big.

15:31.401 --> 15:34.269
Hey, come on.

15:34.271 --> 15:37.472
Don't you remember
anything good about us?

15:37.474 --> 15:38.474
About me?

15:41.711 --> 15:44.479
You're such an asshole.

15:44.481 --> 15:45.601
You know I had to leave.

15:51.422 --> 15:52.621
Shit, that's her.

15:52.623 --> 15:53.855
Quick, hide.

15:53.857 --> 15:54.656
What?

15:54.658 --> 15:55.624
Why?

15:55.626 --> 15:56.725
She's only expecting
me to be here.

15:56.727 --> 15:57.659
She'll run.

15:57.661 --> 15:59.428
Trust me, get out of sight.

15:59.430 --> 16:01.463
Go, go, go, go, go.

16:01.465 --> 16:03.031
Really, Kevin?

16:03.033 --> 16:04.033
Another woman.

16:11.641 --> 16:12.975
Hey, Jessica, come on it.

16:12.977 --> 16:13.775
Hi, Kev.

16:13.777 --> 16:15.010
I'm so sorry.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.988
Come on, get up.

16:49.979 --> 16:51.446
Hey, come on, man, let her go.

16:51.448 --> 16:52.280
She didn't do anything.

16:52.282 --> 16:53.582
I'll... I'll... I'll...

16:53.584 --> 16:57.786
I'll... I'll... I'll
what, Mr. Fuller?

17:00.690 --> 17:02.891
Check the purse, find the phone.

17:19.108 --> 17:21.343
Pass code?

17:21.345 --> 17:25.079
I can't tell you.

17:25.082 --> 17:27.516
And why is that?

17:27.518 --> 17:31.053
Because once you know what's
on there, I'll be useless to you

17:31.055 --> 17:34.990
and you'll just kill me.

17:34.992 --> 17:36.958
That is true.

17:36.960 --> 17:43.565
But I can offer you the
option of a painless death,

17:43.567 --> 17:46.134
if you tell me the pass code.

17:52.041 --> 17:54.009
Hm?

17:54.011 --> 17:55.977
Six.

17:55.979 --> 17:58.447
Hm?

17:58.449 --> 18:01.383
Six, six, six.

18:01.385 --> 18:02.385
Ah, oh.

18:05.321 --> 18:06.321
Good girl.

18:15.599 --> 18:16.599
Oh.

18:22.538 --> 18:23.538
Nice.

18:27.009 --> 18:29.511
The blackmail?

18:29.513 --> 18:31.113
Really?

18:31.115 --> 18:33.348
That was your master plan?

18:33.350 --> 18:38.220
I do hope you had the
foresight to make a backup.

18:38.222 --> 18:41.156
Oh, no, you didn't, did you?

18:44.193 --> 18:47.195
Shame.

18:47.197 --> 18:50.632
I am a man who
keeps his promises.

18:55.905 --> 18:56.671
What?

18:56.673 --> 18:57.472
What?

18:57.474 --> 19:00.509
No, stop.

19:00.511 --> 19:04.346
Jesus Christ, Jess...

19:06.849 --> 19:08.889
I'm sure we could...
we could make a deal.

19:11.487 --> 19:12.787
No.

19:12.789 --> 19:14.823
No,
I'm afraid, Mr. Fuller,

19:14.825 --> 19:20.061
that the time for deals is over.

19:20.063 --> 19:24.833
Now you seem to have forgotten
that our mutual employer

19:24.835 --> 19:28.170
has extremely long arms.

19:28.172 --> 19:30.739
The Senator can go fuck himself.

19:30.741 --> 19:32.374
Thank you.

19:32.376 --> 19:36.745
I shall take great pleasure
in informing him you said so.

19:36.747 --> 19:41.683
Now, Mr. Fuller, if you tell
me where the diamonds are,

19:41.685 --> 19:45.120
this night will get
exponentially shorter,

19:45.122 --> 19:48.557
and potentially, a
great deal less painful.

19:52.461 --> 19:53.461
No?

19:56.599 --> 19:59.534
All right, hurt him.

20:10.313 --> 20:12.514
Oh, my fucking arm.

20:12.516 --> 20:15.116
Where are they, Mr. Fuller?

20:15.118 --> 20:18.853
Don't hurt...

20:18.855 --> 20:21.289
I'll tell you the
honest truth, Mr. Fuller,

20:21.291 --> 20:25.393
I don't really give a flying
fuck where those diamonds are.

20:25.395 --> 20:29.664
What I'm really interested in
is the little electronic device

20:29.666 --> 20:33.268
that was stored with them.

20:34.738 --> 20:39.474
Oh, ha-ha-ha, you find
this funny, do you?

20:39.476 --> 20:40.476
Yeah.

20:44.380 --> 20:46.881
Every man pictures the
way he's going to die,

20:46.883 --> 20:51.486
and this is... this is
just not what I expected.

20:51.488 --> 20:55.323
Who said anything about dying?

20:55.325 --> 20:58.760
Oh, God, what the fuck is that?

21:00.597 --> 21:01.963
Fuck.

21:01.965 --> 21:04.099
Let me make
this easier for you, Mr. Fuller.

21:04.101 --> 21:05.800
If you do not tell
me where the bag is,

21:05.802 --> 21:06.935
I will find your family.

21:06.937 --> 21:09.237
I will have your wife
raped until she is dead.

21:09.239 --> 21:10.372
No, oh, God, no.

21:10.374 --> 21:11.706
And then I will have your child

21:11.708 --> 21:14.142
sold to slavery in the
very worst Dickensian

21:14.144 --> 21:15.777
hell hole I can find.

21:17.114 --> 21:19.881
I can't... fuck you.

21:19.883 --> 21:22.384
Fuck the Senator.

21:22.386 --> 21:27.689
And fuck this bed which
is probably made in China.

21:27.691 --> 21:31.192
Skewer his fucking shoulder.

21:33.563 --> 21:36.865
It's your
last chance, Mr. Fuller.

21:36.867 --> 21:38.466
You're going to talk.

21:38.468 --> 21:40.669
Everybody does.

21:49.145 --> 21:51.279
Do it again.

21:56.652 --> 21:59.087
All right, OK, OK.

22:06.495 --> 22:08.396
Why has he stopped moving?

22:08.398 --> 22:09.398
Wake him up.

22:14.103 --> 22:16.905
I think he's dead.

22:16.907 --> 22:18.340
What do you mean he's dead?

22:18.342 --> 22:21.409
No, no, no, he can't
die until I say he dies.

22:27.183 --> 22:29.117
Oh, for fuck's sake.

22:39.061 --> 22:44.899
OK, OK, search him for
ID, see where he lives.

22:44.901 --> 22:47.702
Maybe he stashed
the diamonds there.

22:47.704 --> 22:49.037
Then clean up this fucking mess.

23:21.771 --> 23:23.371
It's the call you've
been waiting for, Senator.

23:23.373 --> 23:24.839
Yes, of course.

23:24.841 --> 23:26.274
You all excuse me.

23:26.276 --> 23:29.477
Save a couple dances, darling.

23:29.479 --> 23:31.613
Do you have him?

23:31.615 --> 23:36.084
Uh, not exactly, sir, but
the girl has been handled

23:36.086 --> 23:38.820
and the video has been erased.

23:38.822 --> 23:40.255
On that front, at
least, you are safe.

23:40.257 --> 23:42.290
That video is embarrassing.

23:42.292 --> 23:43.792
The drive is treason.

23:55.438 --> 23:56.738
You'd best find it.

23:56.740 --> 23:58.940
Yes, we'll toss the
room before we leave.

23:58.942 --> 24:00.408
I'm confident we'll find it.

24:00.410 --> 24:03.478
Speaking of overconfident,
how's our friend

24:03.480 --> 24:04.913
Mr. Fuller cooperating?

24:04.915 --> 24:08.783
Yes, Mr. Fuller, um,
how can I say this,

24:08.785 --> 24:13.054
has checked out of this hotel.

24:13.056 --> 24:16.324
Soon as we find his partners,
I'll call you, let you know.

24:21.564 --> 24:22.697
Mr. Washington?

24:25.501 --> 24:26.501
Are you there?

24:48.190 --> 24:49.357
Oops.

24:49.359 --> 24:50.359
Witness.

25:03.273 --> 25:04.273
Shit.

25:25.027 --> 25:26.861
Backup, eleventh floor.

25:44.747 --> 25:46.214
She shot my foot in two.

25:50.786 --> 25:53.154
What the hell is
going on out here?

25:53.156 --> 25:53.955
Ebola outbreak.

25:53.957 --> 25:55.037
Get back in your room.

26:48.945 --> 26:49.945
Ah.

27:11.834 --> 27:18.139
Hey, there, I really
need to get to a hos...

27:37.326 --> 27:39.827
I took you for a working girl.

27:39.829 --> 27:43.364
You know, wrong place, wrong
time, that kind of thing.

27:43.366 --> 27:48.336
But then I found this
little baby in your room.

27:48.338 --> 27:52.907
A Vektor SP1, custom edition.

27:52.909 --> 27:56.978
Nice gun, pro's gun.

27:56.980 --> 27:59.747
So now, I have to
assume that you

27:59.749 --> 28:04.085
are part of the Kevin's posse.

28:04.087 --> 28:07.822
Ha, maybe you're
even that smashing

28:07.824 --> 28:13.795
little red head that the news
services are so excited about.

28:13.797 --> 28:16.364
Kind of sloppy
though, wasn't it?

28:16.366 --> 28:20.902
Getting your face
seen like that?

28:20.904 --> 28:24.072
You know, your face is
vaguely familiar to me.

28:24.074 --> 28:26.374
Have we met before?

28:26.376 --> 28:28.509
You'd have remembered me.

28:28.511 --> 28:30.011
Maybe.

28:30.013 --> 28:34.949
And I would have
remembered that tie.

28:34.951 --> 28:39.954
Right now, I think my tie is
the least of your problems.

28:39.956 --> 28:42.857
I'm going to blow his head off.

28:59.475 --> 29:01.342
She's good.

29:01.344 --> 29:04.445
Really fucking good.

29:04.447 --> 29:06.414
Let's go down.

29:25.601 --> 29:27.401
She thinks she's being
clever, but I've seen

29:27.403 --> 29:30.404
this in far too many movies.

29:32.942 --> 29:33.942
Go back up.

30:27.296 --> 30:28.296
The laundry room.

30:56.225 --> 30:58.385
She's on the sky bridge
headed for the parking.

31:13.208 --> 31:14.208
Thanks.

32:47.336 --> 32:50.805
I really like this woman.

33:16.465 --> 33:17.465
Ah.

34:06.182 --> 34:08.649
Shit.

34:13.855 --> 34:14.855
Fuck.

34:23.632 --> 34:26.132
Engaging in confrontation.

34:27.136 --> 34:29.103
She's not responding.

34:29.105 --> 34:30.103
I'm free.

34:30.106 --> 34:31.106
Stop immediately.

34:40.782 --> 34:41.782
Pull over.
Pull over.

34:41.784 --> 34:42.583
I repeat.

34:42.585 --> 34:44.085
Pull over.

34:44.087 --> 34:45.246
This is your last warning.

34:49.591 --> 34:50.591
Oh, shit.

35:19.354 --> 35:20.354
Ah.

35:48.618 --> 35:50.484
I'll smash your goddamn head in.

35:50.486 --> 35:51.685
Who is it?
It's me.

35:51.687 --> 35:52.753
Let me in.

35:52.755 --> 35:54.121
You out of your goddamn
mind coming here.

35:54.123 --> 35:57.825
Just let me in... please.

35:57.827 --> 35:59.393
Please, oh, that's new.

35:59.395 --> 36:00.327
I don't think I've ever...

36:00.329 --> 36:01.128
Quiet.

36:01.130 --> 36:02.763
Open that goddamn door.

36:02.765 --> 36:04.465
That's more like it.

36:04.467 --> 36:06.467
Choke on it, you dumb bitch.

36:06.469 --> 36:08.936
Hey, you want to make 10
grand for pressing a button?

36:08.938 --> 36:09.870
Open the damn door.

36:09.872 --> 36:11.472
Let me in.

36:11.474 --> 36:12.706
10 grand?

36:12.708 --> 36:13.541
Yes.

36:13.543 --> 36:14.842
Let me in and I'll give it you.

36:14.844 --> 36:16.810
Show it to me.

36:16.812 --> 36:17.812
There's no time.

36:20.715 --> 36:21.682
Come on.

36:21.684 --> 36:22.616
Come on.

36:22.618 --> 36:23.851
Come on.

36:23.853 --> 36:25.186
I'm counting.

36:25.188 --> 36:26.187
They're after me.

36:26.189 --> 36:27.388
Who's after you?

36:27.390 --> 36:28.889
You didn't bring the
gobshack cops here, did you?

36:28.891 --> 36:32.092
No, they're fucking cleaners,
serious goddamn cleaners.

36:34.863 --> 36:36.030
Why should I help you?

36:36.032 --> 36:37.298
Because they killed Kevin.

36:42.070 --> 36:43.070
Get in.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.217
Nice nose.

36:56.219 --> 36:57.284
Cow.

36:57.286 --> 37:00.187
Here, keep it.

37:00.189 --> 37:01.555
For Kev's funeral.

37:01.557 --> 37:02.757
Always knew you were a softy.

37:07.028 --> 37:09.363
I barricaded the door.

37:09.365 --> 37:11.465
Heavy artillery?

37:11.467 --> 37:13.934
Not much, just
what the law allows.

37:13.936 --> 37:16.270
I docked everything else
in case we got busted.

37:16.272 --> 37:17.771
Don't worry.

37:17.773 --> 37:19.540
This'll get the job done.

37:19.542 --> 37:21.208
Nice.

37:21.210 --> 37:22.009
Thanks.

37:22.011 --> 37:23.644
Needs something though.

37:23.646 --> 37:25.179
You're right.

37:25.181 --> 37:27.147
Not sure what though.

37:27.149 --> 37:28.816
You going somewhere?

37:28.818 --> 37:30.517
Oh, with your face
being all over the news,

37:30.519 --> 37:32.286
I thought it might be
better to lay low somewhere

37:32.288 --> 37:35.489
with no extradition law.

37:37.393 --> 37:38.392
I need your laptop.

37:38.394 --> 37:40.160
I look like I have
a fucking laptop?

37:40.162 --> 37:42.196
OK, a desktop, a
fucking tablet, anything?

37:42.198 --> 37:43.330
Ha.

37:43.332 --> 37:45.566
Oh, please tell me you
at leas have a phone.

37:45.568 --> 37:46.568
In the back.

37:53.575 --> 37:55.509
Whoa, whoa, what the
fuck are you doing?

37:55.511 --> 37:57.978
I don't want 'em to
think we're hiding.

37:57.980 --> 38:00.547
That's the only way in there.

38:00.549 --> 38:02.449
Let 'em come.

38:02.451 --> 38:05.519
Make your phone call.

38:05.521 --> 38:07.601
Me and the old bastard'll
take care of it.

38:22.672 --> 38:24.271
Hello?

38:24.273 --> 38:25.105
Penny?

38:25.107 --> 38:26.107
It's Alex.

38:32.013 --> 38:34.982
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

38:38.486 --> 38:39.987
- Leave us alone.
- Listen to me...

38:39.989 --> 38:41.155
No, you listen to me.

38:41.157 --> 38:44.258
You stay away from my family.

38:44.260 --> 38:45.626
Is that piece of shit with you?

38:45.628 --> 38:46.427
No, he's not.
He's...

38:46.429 --> 38:47.461
He shouldn't even be with you.

38:47.463 --> 38:48.262
You'll kill him.

38:48.264 --> 38:49.096
Listen to me.

38:49.098 --> 38:50.297
You and your kid are in danger.

38:50.299 --> 38:51.265
You need to get out.

38:51.267 --> 38:52.466
What have you gotten
him involved in.

38:52.468 --> 38:54.535
Shut up.

38:54.537 --> 38:56.970
Look, Kevin has a
secret hiding place.

38:56.972 --> 38:59.006
Don't you worry.

38:59.008 --> 39:00.040
Daddy's home.

39:00.042 --> 39:01.709
He's got a lovely
fish dinner for you.

39:01.711 --> 39:03.143
He keeps things in there.

39:03.145 --> 39:04.378
I'm sure he told you about it.

39:04.380 --> 39:06.547
Don't know what
you're talking about.

39:06.549 --> 39:08.515
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

39:08.517 --> 39:10.918
Now, there's enough there
to care of you forever.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.387
There should also
be a package for me.

39:13.389 --> 39:16.223
My husband is out of
your kind of business.

39:16.225 --> 39:18.359
Hey, you like the
house you're living in?

39:18.361 --> 39:21.095
Where do you think you
got the money for it, huh?

39:21.097 --> 39:22.796
Oh, my God, that bank yesterday?

39:22.798 --> 39:24.865
That was you two?

39:24.867 --> 39:26.533
He promised me.

39:26.535 --> 39:32.373
Look, just take what's in
there and bring the package to...

39:32.375 --> 39:34.808
I am not bringing you anything.

39:34.810 --> 39:37.077
God, this isn't about
you and me anymore.

39:37.079 --> 39:38.746
He is my husband, not yours.

39:38.748 --> 39:42.483
He chose me, so get over
it and leave me alone.

39:42.485 --> 39:43.684
Goddamn it.

39:43.686 --> 39:46.820
Put the phone down.

39:46.822 --> 39:49.690
Come on.

39:49.692 --> 39:51.592
You gotta have another piece.

39:51.594 --> 39:55.162
Lubbish, I got it.

39:55.164 --> 39:57.531
Come on in, fellas.

39:57.533 --> 39:58.533
Join the party.

40:03.605 --> 40:05.606
Let's dance.

40:05.608 --> 40:07.074
Behind you.

40:36.471 --> 40:37.704
Shh.

40:37.706 --> 40:39.540
Try under the bed.

40:44.045 --> 40:45.846
Well, that was subtle.

40:45.848 --> 40:50.617
Where's your sense of
fucking finesse, huh?

40:50.619 --> 40:51.685
Get out, dunkoff.

41:33.661 --> 41:34.995
Oh, fuck.

41:49.911 --> 41:51.645
Hello.

41:51.647 --> 41:52.546
Hello.

41:52.548 --> 41:54.081
And what's your name?

41:54.083 --> 41:55.849
Matthew Micheal Fuller.

41:55.851 --> 41:58.719
Well, hello, Matthew
Micheal Fuller.

41:58.721 --> 42:00.854
My name is Mr. Johnson.

42:00.856 --> 42:04.725
I'm calling from the
telephone company.

42:04.727 --> 42:07.127
You sound like you're
a very big boy.

42:07.129 --> 42:07.928
Yes, sir.

42:07.930 --> 42:09.830
I am almost six.

42:09.832 --> 42:13.767
Six, really, well, that is old.

42:13.769 --> 42:16.370
And are you a
clever boy, Matthew?

42:16.372 --> 42:17.571
Mhm.

42:17.573 --> 42:18.772
Yes?

42:18.774 --> 42:23.410
Well, let's see just how
clever you are, shall we?

42:23.412 --> 42:26.213
I'm going to give you a
little test, all right?

42:26.215 --> 42:30.017
K.

42:35.823 --> 42:38.992
Do you know your full address?

42:38.994 --> 42:42.696
7415 Glen Avenue.

42:42.698 --> 42:47.067
Oh, you are clever.

42:47.069 --> 42:48.802
Well done, Matthew.

42:48.804 --> 42:51.371
Do you want to
know anything else?

42:51.373 --> 42:53.373
No, no, that's, uh, that's quite

42:53.375 --> 42:54.741
all right for today, Matthew.

42:54.743 --> 42:56.476
If ever I should
meet you, I'm going

42:56.478 --> 42:58.812
to give you a very big prize.

42:58.814 --> 43:00.480
OK, nice talking to you.

43:00.482 --> 43:01.949
Nice
talking to you, bye-bye.

43:05.153 --> 43:07.921
All right, I know
where she's heading.

43:07.923 --> 43:09.122
Let's move out.

43:09.124 --> 43:11.725
Tell Ms. Pinder to get her
ass in gear and join us.

43:23.004 --> 43:24.438
God, Kevin, what did you do?

43:43.825 --> 43:45.592
You need
to get the hell... stupid.

43:50.232 --> 43:51.232
Fuck.

44:23.531 --> 44:24.531
Mommy.

44:24.533 --> 44:26.600
Oh, Matty.

44:26.602 --> 44:27.467
You got scared.

44:27.469 --> 44:29.369
I did.

44:29.371 --> 44:31.938
Do you want some food?

44:31.940 --> 44:33.040
Come.

44:33.042 --> 44:35.008
How about some crunchy
choco vampire guys?

44:35.010 --> 44:35.809
Yeah.

44:35.811 --> 44:36.811
Yeah.

44:38.913 --> 44:41.448
Matthew, didn't I tell you to
put your toys away last night?

44:41.450 --> 44:43.150
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

44:43.152 --> 44:43.984
Hurry up and eat.

44:43.986 --> 44:45.485
Mommy needs five minutes.

44:45.487 --> 44:46.953
We're gonna go on
a trip today, OK?

44:46.955 --> 44:49.423
Yeah.

44:49.425 --> 44:50.425
Be right back.

45:08.209 --> 45:10.644
Hey, babe, how you doing?

45:10.646 --> 45:12.112
I'm downstairs.

45:12.114 --> 45:13.213
Grab your helmet.

45:13.215 --> 45:14.014
Come on.

45:14.016 --> 45:15.916
Hey, hey, come back here.

45:18.820 --> 45:20.754
Matthew, I need you to
get dressed right now.

45:20.756 --> 45:22.956
Hurry.

45:22.958 --> 45:24.257
Matthew?

45:24.259 --> 45:26.126
Matty?

45:26.128 --> 45:27.128
Matthew?

45:29.530 --> 45:30.964
Thank God, Matthew,
we have to go.

45:30.966 --> 45:32.799
There's someone outside.

45:32.801 --> 45:33.700
What?

45:33.702 --> 45:34.902
I think they want to come in.

45:47.682 --> 45:49.116
Good morning.

45:49.118 --> 45:51.585
Early bird, et
cetera, et cetera.

45:51.587 --> 45:52.753
Matty.

45:52.755 --> 45:53.755
Mommy.

45:57.525 --> 45:59.993
That's what we're looking for.

46:03.931 --> 46:06.500
Mommy, I'm scared.

46:06.502 --> 46:07.300
Yes?

46:07.302 --> 46:08.869
Mommy.

46:08.871 --> 46:10.337
One moment.

46:10.339 --> 46:12.906
Matthew, there's a
grown up on the phone.

46:12.908 --> 46:15.142
Don't be rude.

46:15.144 --> 46:17.043
What's the situation
back at the hotel?

46:17.045 --> 46:19.146
We've made pretty good time.

46:19.148 --> 46:21.148
We're ready to dispose
of the garbage.

46:21.150 --> 46:22.315
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

46:27.155 --> 46:28.789
Could you clean up here?

46:28.791 --> 46:30.223
No problem.

46:30.225 --> 46:32.292
And the woman?

46:32.294 --> 46:35.762
Do with them what you will.

46:35.764 --> 46:38.165
Dad, where's my daddy?

46:38.167 --> 46:39.533
Tragic.

46:39.535 --> 46:42.502
Goodbye, Matthew.

46:42.504 --> 46:46.807
We have a few minutes
to kill, so to speak.

46:46.809 --> 46:49.509
I like that.

46:49.511 --> 46:51.678
I'd like to spend a
few minutes with her.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.113
Yeah, right, new guy.

46:58.019 --> 47:01.888
You handle the kid.

47:01.890 --> 47:03.023
Go, get him.

47:10.464 --> 47:11.565
Come here, kid.

47:18.072 --> 47:21.241
Get down from there, kid.

47:21.243 --> 47:23.710
Santa's not up there.

47:23.712 --> 47:25.111
Do you think this is a game?

47:25.113 --> 47:26.113
I do.

47:51.240 --> 47:55.909
Please... please.

47:55.911 --> 47:56.910
Come on.
Come on.

47:56.912 --> 47:57.711
Run.

47:57.713 --> 47:58.645
Run and hide.

47:58.647 --> 47:59.647
Run.

48:17.365 --> 48:18.331
Come on.

48:18.333 --> 48:20.300
You know you want to.

48:20.302 --> 48:24.437
You know you want to.

48:24.439 --> 48:28.008
Now... Now that
you're newly single,

48:28.010 --> 48:32.145
I'm going to enjoy this.

48:32.147 --> 48:33.147
Come on.

48:33.948 --> 48:35.115
Hey, big man.

48:35.117 --> 48:36.583
Hey, look... ah.

48:46.994 --> 48:49.462
I don't want him to see this.

48:49.464 --> 48:50.463
What?

48:50.465 --> 48:51.965
Me killing you?

48:51.967 --> 48:57.070
Humph, no, but you're
in the ball park.

49:08.783 --> 49:11.351
Hey, I want you to
stay in here and don't

49:11.353 --> 49:12.485
come out until I get you.

49:12.487 --> 49:15.455
I'll be right back, OK?

49:15.457 --> 49:18.692
You move, I kill your kid.

49:33.908 --> 49:37.577
Oh-ho-ho, I know
what you're thinking.

49:37.579 --> 49:39.646
I took that idiot
in the other room,

49:39.648 --> 49:41.481
I can take this guy, right?

49:41.483 --> 49:42.315
Right?

49:42.317 --> 49:43.249
Drop it.

49:43.251 --> 49:44.251
Drop it.

49:53.227 --> 49:54.794
Ouch.

49:54.796 --> 49:56.896
Foreplay.

49:56.898 --> 49:57.898
Drop it.

50:01.268 --> 50:03.603
Oh, you want play?

50:03.605 --> 50:05.105
Oh-ho-ho.

50:05.107 --> 50:06.107
Let's play.

50:21.555 --> 50:22.989
You son of a bitch.

50:28.029 --> 50:29.496
It's OK, it's OK.

50:29.498 --> 50:31.998
It's over.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.300
You got him.

50:34.302 --> 50:36.369
You got him.

50:37.172 --> 50:38.172
Matthew.

50:44.178 --> 50:45.245
Yes?

50:45.247 --> 50:46.479
Good morning, Mr. Washington.

50:46.481 --> 50:47.814
Good morning, sir.

50:47.816 --> 50:50.784
My apologies for hanging up
so abruptly on you earlier.

50:50.786 --> 50:54.220
We've had something
of a trying day.

50:54.222 --> 50:55.055
Never mind that.

50:55.057 --> 50:57.457
Do you have the drive?

50:57.459 --> 50:59.559
Yeah, we may have hit
a little bit of a snag

50:59.561 --> 51:00.827
in that department, sir.

51:00.829 --> 51:02.796
Don't bullshit the bullshitter.

51:02.798 --> 51:04.931
You had Mr. Fuller in
hand seven hour ago.

51:04.933 --> 51:06.666
What went wrong?

51:06.668 --> 51:08.435
Well, one of
Fuller's associates,

51:08.437 --> 51:12.439
she's highly trained,
possibly ex-military.

51:12.441 --> 51:16.609
I suppose I should thank
you for coming back for us.

51:16.611 --> 51:18.378
It's what Kevin
would have wanted.

51:18.380 --> 51:19.179
We're even.

51:19.181 --> 51:21.147
You just saved my life.

51:21.149 --> 51:22.782
I guess I did.

51:22.784 --> 51:26.319
Ironic, considering all the
times I've wished you dead.

51:26.321 --> 51:27.720
Kevin wanted to get out.

51:27.722 --> 51:28.788
No, he didn't.

51:28.790 --> 51:31.257
Kevin always preferred
the easy way out.

51:31.259 --> 51:36.329
You know, take it
instead of earn it.

51:36.331 --> 51:38.731
Those guys are gonna be back.

51:38.733 --> 51:40.133
They murdered Kevin
and they will kill

51:40.135 --> 51:42.268
us too unless I kill 'em first.

51:42.270 --> 51:44.471
What's on the drive?

51:44.473 --> 51:46.639
No idea, but we're
about to find out.

51:58.919 --> 51:59.819
Shit.

51:59.821 --> 52:01.087
We have to get out of here.

52:01.089 --> 52:03.456
They've tracked the drive,
now they know where it is.

52:03.458 --> 52:04.657
How can I help?

52:04.659 --> 52:05.592
What about Matthew?

52:05.594 --> 52:07.727
I can leave him with my mother.

52:07.729 --> 52:09.562
It's just a logistical thing,

52:09.564 --> 52:10.763
nothing for you to worry about.

52:10.765 --> 52:13.867
Politics is logistics,
son, and I worried plenty,

52:13.869 --> 52:16.269
especially about highly
trained ex-military woman

52:16.271 --> 52:18.037
y'all can't seem to deal with.

52:18.039 --> 52:20.106
Yes, I do have a plan, sir.

52:20.108 --> 52:21.708
Well, good.

52:21.710 --> 52:24.711
Run it by Doug
when he gets there.

52:24.713 --> 52:27.514
Uh, sir, I can assure
you there is absolutely

52:27.516 --> 52:30.450
no need to send Mr. MacArthur.

52:30.452 --> 52:34.187
We have the situation
well in hand.

52:34.189 --> 52:35.755
Do you?

52:35.757 --> 52:37.557
Well, good.

52:37.559 --> 52:39.125
He can use the vacation.

52:39.127 --> 52:41.694
This business has
him a little upset.

52:41.696 --> 52:42.729
He's in the air now.

52:42.731 --> 52:44.797
He should be landing
in a few hours.

52:44.799 --> 52:48.701
Yes, sir, I very much look
forward to working with him.

52:53.741 --> 52:56.075
I hope you have a good
fucking night too.

53:00.080 --> 53:01.080
Back in five.

53:04.519 --> 53:07.020
It's all under control, sir.

53:07.022 --> 53:08.588
Do I detect some frustration

53:08.590 --> 53:11.558
or doubt, Mr. Washington?

53:11.560 --> 53:12.659
How did you...

53:12.661 --> 53:14.060
Does redial ring a bell?

53:14.062 --> 53:18.698
You should be you're alone when
you give away your best tricks.

53:18.700 --> 53:20.700
So you were there.

53:20.702 --> 53:23.636
Where, may I ask?

53:23.638 --> 53:26.172
This magician
doesn't reveal her secrets.

53:26.174 --> 53:27.174
Tell you what.

53:29.610 --> 53:33.213
I'll be a good sport and
give you a head start.

53:33.215 --> 53:35.682
If I were you, I'd
get out of that hotel

53:35.684 --> 53:37.083
cause cops are on the way.

53:37.085 --> 53:39.285
Oh, you're not going
to call the cops.

53:39.287 --> 53:41.888
Even if you were that stupid,
we'd be out of this hotel

53:41.890 --> 53:45.525
before... Oh.

53:45.527 --> 53:48.761
Ho-ho, clever girl.

53:48.763 --> 53:49.596
Move it.

53:49.598 --> 53:50.598
She's made us.

54:13.787 --> 54:14.787
Tsk-tsk.

55:21.322 --> 55:22.488
Ms. Clinton, come with me.

55:22.490 --> 55:24.057
Mr. Jefferson, stay here.

55:24.059 --> 55:25.725
And then can we can get
me to the frickin doctor?

55:25.727 --> 55:31.531
My foot feels like it's
going to fall... forget it.

55:34.468 --> 55:36.402
He's right on the edge.

55:36.404 --> 55:39.339
So if you think he won't throw
you in along with the garbage

55:39.341 --> 55:42.709
in the trunk, you're wrong.

56:00.862 --> 56:01.828
Yeah?

56:01.830 --> 56:03.096
Alex, I need to
tell you something.

56:03.098 --> 56:04.097
It's about the diamonds.

56:04.099 --> 56:05.598
I...

56:05.600 --> 56:06.766
I can't talk right now.

56:06.768 --> 56:07.808
Stick with the plan.

56:22.383 --> 56:24.317
We have to stop
meeting like this.

56:27.821 --> 56:30.123
Open.

56:30.125 --> 56:31.125
Open.

57:07.594 --> 57:08.494
Where is he?

57:08.496 --> 57:10.263
He probably went to take a leak.

57:10.265 --> 57:12.385
This is what you get
for hiring a half wit.

57:27.347 --> 57:28.387
Mind your head, Kev.

57:35.823 --> 57:37.857
Do you think we'll
see her again?

57:37.859 --> 57:40.026
Oh, undoubtedly.

57:40.028 --> 57:41.661
We have what she wants.

57:41.663 --> 57:43.896
She wouldn't risk it.

57:43.898 --> 57:45.398
Ha, of course she would.

57:56.243 --> 58:00.179
Ha-ha, talk of the devil.

58:00.181 --> 58:01.848
There you are.

58:01.850 --> 58:02.982
I missed you at the hotel.

58:02.984 --> 58:04.116
I didn't miss you.

58:04.118 --> 58:05.017
I want my property.

58:05.019 --> 58:06.586
Well, of course you do.

58:06.588 --> 58:09.555
Diamonds are a girl's
best friend after all.

58:09.557 --> 58:10.957
Very funny.

58:10.959 --> 58:12.925
I aim to please.

58:12.927 --> 58:15.361
You know, this
could be a mutually

58:15.363 --> 58:17.096
beneficial relationship.

58:17.098 --> 58:19.765
Oh, now you want a
relationship, huh?

58:19.767 --> 58:21.601
Oh, stop it.

58:21.603 --> 58:23.736
People say we're
falling in love.

58:23.738 --> 58:25.905
Yeah, love this.

58:25.907 --> 58:27.440
Give me back my diamonds.

58:27.442 --> 58:31.611
Yeah, except they're not
actually yours, are they?

58:31.613 --> 58:34.614
You know, strictly speaking,
they belong to a senator.

58:34.616 --> 58:36.816
Because the Senator
needs more money.

58:36.818 --> 58:37.617
I don't think so.

58:37.619 --> 58:39.485
They're mine now.

58:39.487 --> 58:41.754
We both know the Senator didn't
hire us to steal the diamonds.

58:41.756 --> 58:44.357
He hired us to steal the drive.

58:44.359 --> 58:46.826
So I'm going to go
ahead and call Kevin's

58:46.828 --> 58:49.595
murder a breach of
contract and take

58:49.597 --> 58:52.231
the diamonds as compensation.

58:52.233 --> 58:55.902
Hm, I guess you have a point.

58:55.904 --> 58:59.071
But how can I get
them to you if, uh, I

58:59.073 --> 59:01.007
don't know where you are?

59:01.009 --> 59:02.375
I'll give you a hint.

59:02.377 --> 59:05.845
It's rectangular, way out
of date, and it stinks.

59:05.847 --> 59:07.547
Oh.

59:07.549 --> 59:08.848
I see.

59:08.850 --> 59:11.984
Well, if you're looking for
the diamonds in that car,

59:11.986 --> 59:15.988
I'm afraid you're going
to be sorely disappointed.

59:15.990 --> 59:17.056
Not at all.

59:17.058 --> 59:19.225
Found just what I
was looking for.

59:19.227 --> 59:20.626
And he'd like to say hi.

59:24.531 --> 59:26.799
Say hello to the nice man.

59:26.801 --> 59:29.602
She's got a gun in my mouth.

59:29.604 --> 59:30.836
Excuse me?

59:30.838 --> 59:34.206
He said
she's got a gun in my mouth.

59:34.208 --> 59:35.841
So let's make a deal.

59:35.843 --> 59:38.778
I'll trade you this piece
of shit for my diamonds.

59:38.780 --> 59:41.581
Otherwise, his head whistles.

59:41.583 --> 59:45.585
Well, as I don't really
care whether you turn him

59:45.587 --> 59:48.387
into a flute or not, I'm
afraid the only deal I'm going

59:48.389 --> 59:51.190
to be doing is for the drive.

59:51.192 --> 59:55.061
So I will give you
your diamonds as you're

59:55.063 --> 59:58.397
so fond of calling them,
you give me the drive,

59:58.399 --> 01:00:00.933
and we all skip away happy.

01:00:00.935 --> 01:00:02.001
I don't negotiate.

01:00:02.003 --> 01:00:02.802
Offer's on the table.

01:00:02.804 --> 01:00:06.072
You have five seconds.

01:00:06.074 --> 01:00:06.872
What?

01:00:06.874 --> 01:00:08.808
No more witty banter.

01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:10.142
Four.

01:00:10.144 --> 01:00:11.344
Three.

01:00:11.346 --> 01:00:13.412
Nothing doesn't suit you.

01:00:13.414 --> 01:00:14.313
Two.

01:00:14.315 --> 01:00:15.314
Last chance.

01:00:15.316 --> 01:00:17.883
I just don't think
you're this cold.

01:00:21.455 --> 01:00:22.455
One.

01:00:29.096 --> 01:00:29.895
Where is she?

01:00:29.897 --> 01:00:31.297
I didn't see her.

01:00:31.299 --> 01:00:32.264
Why'd you let her get away?

01:00:32.266 --> 01:00:34.233
I never saw her.

01:00:34.235 --> 01:00:37.203
You stop that fucking horn.

01:00:38.673 --> 01:00:39.673
Oh, shit.

01:00:56.858 --> 01:00:58.991
Damn, she's good.

01:00:58.993 --> 01:01:00.292
Now where the hell is she?

01:01:00.294 --> 01:01:03.062
I have no idea, but she's
certainly full of surprises.

01:01:10.937 --> 01:01:11.937
I liked that coat.

01:01:23.417 --> 01:01:25.217
Right this way, guys.

01:01:25.219 --> 01:01:27.153
Right this way.

01:01:27.155 --> 01:01:31.157
Goddamn, she's still here.

01:01:31.159 --> 01:01:32.358
Ready, Jessica?

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.280
You're going to
look just like me.

01:01:58.852 --> 01:02:01.087
Hey, Penny, it's me.

01:02:01.089 --> 01:02:03.089
Now, listen, here's the plan.

01:02:03.091 --> 01:02:08.661
I have right here in my
hand what it is you want.

01:02:08.663 --> 01:02:13.065
But if you want it, you're
gonna have to come and get it.

01:02:13.067 --> 01:02:16.902
Isn't it time we were
properly introduced?

01:02:16.904 --> 01:02:19.305
You know, face to face?

01:02:25.779 --> 01:02:28.013
Is this face to
face enough for you?

01:02:29.951 --> 01:02:33.819
Oh, you do continue
to delight and amaze.

01:02:33.821 --> 01:02:36.922
And you're really, really
starting to piss me off.

01:02:36.924 --> 01:02:38.624
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:02:38.626 --> 01:02:41.827
I really can't imagine why.

01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:43.295
One more step and
he takes flight.

01:02:43.297 --> 01:02:44.130
Yeah?

01:02:44.132 --> 01:02:45.564
Then you'll come right with me.

01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:52.271
I'm bored.

01:02:54.674 --> 01:02:55.674
Wake her up.

01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:14.593
Sorry about your clothes.

01:03:14.595 --> 01:03:18.264
Ms. Clinton, here, was a
little over enthusiastic

01:03:18.266 --> 01:03:19.598
in her search for the drive.

01:03:22.369 --> 01:03:25.004
Do you care for a game?

01:03:25.006 --> 01:03:26.705
Go fuck yourself.

01:03:26.707 --> 01:03:29.475
Glad to see you haven't lost
your sense of elegant repartee.

01:03:32.512 --> 01:03:35.147
I'm fed up playing these two.

01:03:35.149 --> 01:03:37.449
Give me a challenge.

01:03:37.451 --> 01:03:39.785
Thought I already had.

01:03:39.787 --> 01:03:41.987
Touche.

01:03:41.989 --> 01:03:43.556
Come on.

01:03:43.558 --> 01:03:45.624
I don't play.

01:03:45.626 --> 01:03:47.560
Strange.

01:03:47.562 --> 01:03:51.263
I had you pegged
for a chess champ.

01:03:51.265 --> 01:03:56.335
Maybe high stakes poker is more
your thing, what with that,

01:03:56.337 --> 01:03:59.104
uh, expressive face of yours.

01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:06.579
Now, you have something I want.

01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:08.214
I have something you want.

01:04:08.216 --> 01:04:10.950
Oh, no, that's not
quite right, is it?

01:04:10.952 --> 01:04:18.952
Because what you want is,
in fact, entirely worthless.

01:04:28.501 --> 01:04:30.870
Did Kevin fuck you over?

01:04:30.872 --> 01:04:32.571
Hm?

01:04:32.573 --> 01:04:35.074
Because I know you
didn't steal a bag

01:04:35.076 --> 01:04:39.111
of broken windshield glass.

01:04:39.113 --> 01:04:45.551
Now, looks as if the only thing
you have left to bargain with

01:04:45.553 --> 01:04:47.653
is your life.

01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:50.923
And you should
know this about me.

01:04:50.925 --> 01:04:54.793
I always get what I want.

01:04:54.795 --> 01:04:58.697
So, tell me.

01:04:58.699 --> 01:05:02.334
Where is the drive?

01:05:02.336 --> 01:05:03.769
Fuck you.

01:05:03.771 --> 01:05:06.939
Oh, well, you give
me little choice.

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:15.714
Frank, you prepare her leg.

01:05:26.326 --> 01:05:27.326
Ah.

01:05:47.914 --> 01:05:51.684
Now if you don't help
me with my problem,

01:05:51.686 --> 01:05:52.818
then I can't finish my business.

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.253
And if I don't
finish my business,

01:05:54.255 --> 01:05:55.621
then the Senator doesn't pay me.

01:05:55.623 --> 01:05:56.655
The Senator doesn't pay me...

01:05:56.657 --> 01:06:01.260
Oh, you just love
to talk, don't you?

01:06:01.262 --> 01:06:05.297
This is your final chance.

01:06:05.299 --> 01:06:08.100
Where is the drive?

01:06:14.374 --> 01:06:17.176
OK, let's, uh, kick off
with a couple of turns.

01:06:24.617 --> 01:06:28.220
Oh, couple more like
that and your leg

01:06:28.222 --> 01:06:30.956
is going to be two dimensional.

01:06:30.958 --> 01:06:33.359
Which is one more dimension
than your personality

01:06:33.361 --> 01:06:34.960
will ever achieve.

01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:37.530
Again.

01:06:42.869 --> 01:06:47.072
You know, that leg
is going to pop.

01:06:47.074 --> 01:06:49.775
And when it does, it's
only a matter of time

01:06:49.777 --> 01:06:53.212
before the gangrene sets in.

01:06:53.214 --> 01:06:55.047
Green's always
been my best color.

01:06:55.049 --> 01:06:55.848
Good.

01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:58.717
Ha-ha-ha, just as well, huh?

01:06:58.719 --> 01:07:01.153
Ha-ha-ha, again.

01:07:02.123 --> 01:07:03.055
Hold on.

01:07:03.057 --> 01:07:04.490
Tie it up.

01:07:04.492 --> 01:07:06.492
Where is the drive?

01:07:09.295 --> 01:07:10.095
All right.

01:07:10.097 --> 01:07:11.196
What's in it for me?

01:07:11.198 --> 01:07:12.164
Huh?

01:07:12.166 --> 01:07:15.200
If I help you,
what's in it for me?

01:07:15.202 --> 01:07:19.038
At the very least, your leg.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:23.442
And at the most, your life.

01:07:23.444 --> 01:07:25.310
You're right.

01:07:28.816 --> 01:07:30.416
Go on, keep going.

01:07:36.223 --> 01:07:37.223
Enough.

01:07:40.527 --> 01:07:44.863
Now, you... you really are
prepared to lose your leg.

01:07:44.865 --> 01:07:48.500
You are quite the remarkable...

01:07:51.805 --> 01:07:53.205
Huh.

01:07:53.207 --> 01:07:55.007
Back off, both of you.

01:08:05.718 --> 01:08:11.657
You remind me of a story,
an... an urban legend, perhaps.

01:08:11.659 --> 01:08:17.595
But you know, about
seven years ago, I

01:08:17.598 --> 01:08:20.599
was doing some, um,
some freelance work,

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.569
should we call it, for
the agency in Cairo.

01:08:23.571 --> 01:08:27.439
There was a great deal of
chatter about a senior member

01:08:27.441 --> 01:08:29.207
of the Palestinian
Authority who was

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:31.109
coming into town for
a sit down chitchat

01:08:31.112 --> 01:08:34.779
with some Egyptian ministers.

01:08:34.782 --> 01:08:37.282
And the word on the
street was that he

01:08:37.283 --> 01:08:41.987
was to be housed in an
impenetrable government owned

01:08:41.988 --> 01:08:44.089
fortress.

01:08:44.091 --> 01:08:46.390
Well, you can guess
what happened.

01:08:46.393 --> 01:08:51.497
There was a massive
bomb, but it was set

01:08:51.499 --> 01:08:55.934
on the inside of the building.

01:08:55.935 --> 01:09:02.474
A little birdie told me that the
CIA had struck a deal, letting

01:09:02.475 --> 01:09:08.147
Mossad borrow an incredibly
talented and creative entry

01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:09.148
specialist.

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:12.518
She, for, yes, indeed,
it was a woman,

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.555
was the very best in the
world at penetrating the most

01:09:16.557 --> 01:09:19.558
impenetrable places,
and then, poof,

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.429
disappearing without a trace.

01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:26.932
I'll admit.

01:09:26.934 --> 01:09:30.903
The story has always
fascinated me.

01:09:30.904 --> 01:09:36.108
It's heroine and it's, um, it's
ultimate tragedy, for her blast

01:09:36.109 --> 01:09:38.810
did not kill its
intended target.

01:09:38.812 --> 01:09:43.148
But instead, it
claimed the lives

01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:50.788
of his three sweet young
children and their poor mother.

01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:55.961
He, amazingly, escaped
with only minor injuries.

01:09:59.399 --> 01:10:01.900
I've often thought about
that female operative.

01:10:01.902 --> 01:10:03.969
You know, what went
wrong, do you think?

01:10:03.971 --> 01:10:07.472
Was it, uh, was it poor
intelligence, shoddy equipment,

01:10:07.474 --> 01:10:11.743
or just plain bad fucking luck?

01:10:11.745 --> 01:10:13.712
Did she feel any remorse?

01:10:17.183 --> 01:10:21.486
Or did she manage
to compartmentalize

01:10:21.488 --> 01:10:25.224
the death of the mother
and her three children?

01:10:25.226 --> 01:10:29.261
Perhaps as a... a
man might have done.

01:10:32.131 --> 01:10:33.865
Anyway, the long
and the short of it

01:10:33.867 --> 01:10:38.170
was that the CIA
dropped her as quickly

01:10:38.172 --> 01:10:40.772
as the proverbial hot brick.

01:10:40.774 --> 01:10:43.909
She threatened to go all
Edward Snowden on them

01:10:43.911 --> 01:10:47.079
and they retaliated
by spinning her is

01:10:47.081 --> 01:10:48.814
a double agent slash terrorist.

01:10:51.985 --> 01:10:58.223
Oh, how the might fall, eh?

01:11:02.629 --> 01:11:06.031
What do you think, Alexis?

01:11:09.435 --> 01:11:15.474
Do you think such a mythical
creature could possibly exist?

01:11:15.476 --> 01:11:22.147
Because, boy, the
demons she must carry.

01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:30.055
Now, I'm going to take
a different tact here.

01:11:30.057 --> 01:11:33.625
So I could always
go back and finish

01:11:33.627 --> 01:11:39.564
that other business,
Kevin's wife,

01:11:39.566 --> 01:11:42.801
little Matthew in his jammies.

01:11:42.803 --> 01:11:44.770
You know, boom.

01:11:50.009 --> 01:11:53.745
Yeah, that struck a
chord with you, right?

01:11:53.747 --> 01:11:58.150
I have the feeling that you
might balk at causing yet

01:11:58.152 --> 01:12:02.654
another child infinite pain.

01:12:02.656 --> 01:12:08.393
Whereas me, hm, I
have no such qualms.

01:12:11.464 --> 01:12:13.799
Why should I believe you?

01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:17.703
Because I don't lie.

01:12:17.705 --> 01:12:20.172
Ever.

01:12:20.174 --> 01:12:24.843
K. When and where?

01:12:24.845 --> 01:12:28.847
Western Cape Airport,
tonight, 21:00 hours.

01:12:33.319 --> 01:12:35.787
I'm, uh, gonna
need to make a call.

01:12:38.991 --> 01:12:39.991
Good girl.

01:12:42.762 --> 01:12:43.762
Give her a phone.

01:13:02.515 --> 01:13:03.782
Hello?

01:13:03.784 --> 01:13:06.065
It's going to be Cape Town
Airport, 9:00 PM tonight.

01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:11.790
Hate that redial.

01:13:15.561 --> 01:13:16.721
You want to let me up now?

01:13:18.831 --> 01:13:19.631
Come on.

01:13:19.633 --> 01:13:22.401
Why wait till tonight?

01:13:22.403 --> 01:13:25.704
Because...

01:13:35.081 --> 01:13:43.081
It's going to take that long
for Frank, here, to sew you up.

01:13:44.591 --> 01:13:45.924
Oh, don't worry.

01:13:45.926 --> 01:13:49.895
It's just a flesh wound to
stop your trying to run away.

01:13:52.432 --> 01:13:54.032
You know, you... you
might want to rethink

01:13:54.034 --> 01:13:57.235
the whole chess thing.

01:13:57.237 --> 01:14:00.005
It's good for people
in our line of work.

01:14:00.007 --> 01:14:04.443
This situation here,
that's what we call check.

01:14:08.848 --> 01:14:11.016
Get her dressed.

01:14:11.018 --> 01:14:12.058
Make her look pretty.

01:14:48.821 --> 01:14:52.524
Any chance of going
any faster, grandma?

01:14:52.526 --> 01:14:56.495
Because this really cannot
be hurting this much.

01:15:00.533 --> 01:15:01.333
Frank.

01:15:01.335 --> 01:15:02.455
Come on, are you coming?

01:15:04.804 --> 01:15:06.905
Here is the key.

01:15:06.907 --> 01:15:07.906
Here.

01:15:07.908 --> 01:15:11.142
Oh, you are a
magician, aren't you?

01:15:11.144 --> 01:15:13.111
Thank you.

01:15:13.113 --> 01:15:14.112
Take it.

01:15:14.114 --> 01:15:16.081
Uh, no, no, I don't think so.

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:17.249
It's not part of the deal.

01:15:17.251 --> 01:15:18.083
Yes, it is.

01:15:18.085 --> 01:15:20.185
You get the drive, I walk away.

01:15:20.187 --> 01:15:21.453
No, no.

01:15:21.455 --> 01:15:24.422
You know, because, funnily
enough, I don't trust you.

01:15:24.424 --> 01:15:26.892
I know your style by now.

01:15:26.894 --> 01:15:28.760
Your friend has known
about the airport all day.

01:15:28.762 --> 01:15:32.597
Who knows what nasty little
surprise might be lurking

01:15:32.599 --> 01:15:33.798
behind that locker door.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.433
So if you don't
mind, I won't take

01:15:35.435 --> 01:15:40.672
the key because you're going
to need it to open that locker.

01:15:40.674 --> 01:15:43.508
Go to hell.

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:44.976
Really?

01:15:44.978 --> 01:15:46.278
Excuse me, officer?

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.445
What are you doing?

01:15:47.447 --> 01:15:48.380
Officer?

01:15:48.382 --> 01:15:49.382
Don't.

01:15:52.885 --> 01:15:53.818
Um...

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.153
Can I help you?

01:15:55.155 --> 01:15:56.788
Mm, darling?

01:16:06.499 --> 01:16:08.934
All right, all
right, I'll do it.

01:16:08.936 --> 01:16:11.736
Yeah, sorry, there's a, uh,
unattended bag down there,

01:16:11.738 --> 01:16:12.837
under the stairs.

01:16:12.839 --> 01:16:14.739
I didn't know who to
report it to, so...

01:16:14.741 --> 01:16:15.707
Thank you, sir.

01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:17.075
You're welcome.

01:16:17.077 --> 01:16:17.876
Good work.

01:16:17.878 --> 01:16:18.878
Shall we?

01:16:34.193 --> 01:16:36.161
Flight 822 to Casablanca

01:16:36.163 --> 01:16:37.596
departing in five minutes.

01:17:13.833 --> 01:17:14.833
It's all yours.

01:17:18.638 --> 01:17:19.704
Take it out.

01:17:29.048 --> 01:17:30.515
Here.

01:17:30.517 --> 01:17:32.484
Open it.

01:17:32.486 --> 01:17:33.485
Come on.

01:17:33.487 --> 01:17:34.487
Open it.

01:18:16.429 --> 01:18:17.429
Happy?

01:18:21.767 --> 01:18:22.634
Check it.

01:18:22.636 --> 01:18:23.876
Make sure there's no surprises.

01:18:45.424 --> 01:18:46.691
You trust me now?

01:18:46.693 --> 01:18:50.061
Hm, not now, not ever.

01:18:53.566 --> 01:18:55.066
Oh, fuck.

01:18:55.068 --> 01:18:58.036
Oh, shit.

01:19:05.478 --> 01:19:06.978
How did you...

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:09.280
I had to let you catch
me, otherwise none of this

01:19:09.282 --> 01:19:10.148
would have worked.

01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:12.183
Oh, you magnificent...

01:19:12.185 --> 01:19:13.017
Shh.

01:19:13.019 --> 01:19:14.019
Bitch.

01:19:17.957 --> 01:19:19.457
Stay down, don't move.

01:19:34.273 --> 01:19:36.708
I think this should be
our last face to face.

01:19:50.156 --> 01:19:51.723
You hid it on me?

01:19:51.725 --> 01:19:53.825
That tie wasn't
doing you any favors.

01:19:53.827 --> 01:19:55.107
It had to be good for something.

01:20:24.524 --> 01:20:25.523
Stop him.

01:20:25.525 --> 01:20:26.524
That's him.

01:20:26.526 --> 01:20:27.526
Stop him.

01:20:31.497 --> 01:20:34.165
Stop right there.

01:20:34.167 --> 01:20:34.966
Freeze.

01:20:34.968 --> 01:20:35.934
Put your hands up.

01:20:35.936 --> 01:20:36.935
Right now.

01:20:36.937 --> 01:20:37.936
Put 'em up.

01:20:37.938 --> 01:20:41.406
Don't fucking move.

01:20:41.408 --> 01:20:44.375
Put your hands up.

01:20:44.377 --> 01:20:45.376
Right now.

01:20:45.378 --> 01:20:46.811
Get down on the ground.

01:20:58.357 --> 01:21:01.492
Queen to bishop five.

01:21:01.494 --> 01:21:02.827
Check mate.

01:21:02.829 --> 01:21:05.763
You really are the stuff
of legends, aren't you?

01:21:05.765 --> 01:21:06.931
Kind of like your tie.

01:21:06.933 --> 01:21:09.100
Hm?

01:21:09.102 --> 01:21:10.102
Gun.

01:21:42.101 --> 01:21:43.067
You OK, ma'am?

01:21:43.069 --> 01:21:44.068
Please come with me.

01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:45.990
I want to ask you
a few questions.

01:21:51.477 --> 01:21:52.677
OK, just right this way, ma'am.

01:21:52.679 --> 01:21:53.679
This way, ma'am.

01:21:57.651 --> 01:21:59.017
Can you remember what happened?

01:21:59.019 --> 01:22:01.386
I was here to meet my
friend McKayla when I found out

01:22:01.388 --> 01:22:02.854
her flight had been cancelled.

01:22:05.958 --> 01:22:08.092
Then suddenly there
was this explosion

01:22:08.094 --> 01:22:09.360
and people started shooting.

01:22:12.831 --> 01:22:14.299
What's wrong with this world?

01:22:14.301 --> 01:22:15.767
Schools aren't safe, airports.

01:22:15.769 --> 01:22:18.202
What's next?

01:22:18.204 --> 01:22:20.338
I'm so sorry.

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:22.140
Can I go?

01:22:22.142 --> 01:22:23.274
I'm late to fetch my son.

01:22:23.276 --> 01:22:24.943
I have a few more questions, OK?

01:22:24.945 --> 01:22:26.678
We like to go through
everything with the witnesses

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.346
while the memory is still fresh.

01:22:28.348 --> 01:22:29.147
Hey, Frankie.

01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.948
Yeah?

01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:31.349
You've got to come see this.

01:22:31.351 --> 01:22:32.351
Now.

01:22:37.389 --> 01:22:42.126
We've got your number, so
go ahead and fetch your son.

01:22:42.128 --> 01:22:44.429
If we need anything
else, we'll call you.

01:22:46.932 --> 01:22:47.799
What is it?

01:22:47.801 --> 01:22:49.033
You're not going
to believe this,

01:22:49.035 --> 01:22:50.768
but I think we got the guys
that pulled the Darling

01:22:50.770 --> 01:22:51.810
Street job yesterday.

01:22:54.606 --> 01:22:55.606
Is this it?

01:22:55.608 --> 01:22:57.075
That's all we found.

01:22:57.077 --> 01:22:58.776
The rest must be with the
woman that ran the crew.

01:22:58.778 --> 01:22:59.811
I don't think so, man.

01:22:59.813 --> 01:23:00.813
Check this out.

01:23:06.285 --> 01:23:07.518
Mom?

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.487
Tell Matthew I'm coming.

01:23:09.489 --> 01:23:10.922
Everything's going to be OK.

01:23:14.727 --> 01:23:17.395
Ah, shit.

01:23:17.397 --> 01:23:19.230
And didn't the guard say
she had some kind of scar

01:23:19.232 --> 01:23:20.365
on her face.

01:23:24.169 --> 01:23:25.536
Jesus, this is our girl.

01:23:25.538 --> 01:23:28.306
What kind of sick mind thinks
something like this up, man?

01:23:28.308 --> 01:23:30.308
And who carries a
head around in a bag?

01:23:42.354 --> 01:23:43.788
Lock this airport down.

01:23:48.427 --> 01:23:49.427
Who's in charge?

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.100
You in charge?

01:23:56.102 --> 01:23:57.235
Who's asking?

01:23:57.237 --> 01:23:59.397
We need all the evidence
you have immediately.

01:24:07.446 --> 01:24:09.446
Interpol hasn't got
jurisdiction here.

01:24:13.986 --> 01:24:15.286
I'm calling this in.

01:24:15.288 --> 01:24:16.288
Whatever.

01:24:25.831 --> 01:24:27.911
Here's the bag you
wanted, Mr. MacArthur.

01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:43.481
Have a safe trip.

01:24:43.483 --> 01:24:44.682
Thanks.

01:24:44.684 --> 01:24:45.684
Next?

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.520
Drive.

01:24:51.924 --> 01:24:56.627
Welcome aboard flight AE3621.

01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:59.063
We will try to make your flight
as comfortable as possible.

01:25:06.772 --> 01:25:08.639
Rough couple days.

01:25:08.641 --> 01:25:11.709
Do I look that bad?

01:25:11.711 --> 01:25:13.644
Sorry, it's not rough.

01:25:13.646 --> 01:25:18.282
It's cut, like you'll
if you can't open that.

01:25:18.284 --> 01:25:20.184
Relax.

01:25:20.186 --> 01:25:23.654
I don't work for BAC,
although not voluntarily.

01:25:26.391 --> 01:25:27.992
I mean, there's bad
ass and fucking scary,

01:25:27.994 --> 01:25:30.561
and then there's these guys.

01:25:30.563 --> 01:25:31.529
This going to take long?

01:25:31.531 --> 01:25:34.966
I'm almost there.

01:25:34.968 --> 01:25:36.934
Holy shit.

01:25:36.936 --> 01:25:39.056
Seriously, what sort
of trouble are you in?

01:25:47.212 --> 01:25:49.413
We are going to
engineer an event that shapes

01:25:49.415 --> 01:25:52.550
the destiny of our country.

01:25:52.552 --> 01:25:55.653
In just a few months time,
the north side of Chicago

01:25:55.655 --> 01:25:58.256
is going to make 9/11
look like Macy's Parade.

01:26:02.761 --> 01:26:08.466
And you'll get your war
and I'll get my office.

01:26:08.468 --> 01:26:12.303
It's time we took this country
back the apathetic lemmings

01:26:12.305 --> 01:26:16.641
and sycophantic dilettantes that
have run it into the ground.

01:26:16.643 --> 01:26:19.477
Turned the US into a
fucking punch line.

01:26:36.762 --> 01:26:37.895
Who am I speaking with?

01:26:37.897 --> 01:26:40.631
You can call me Mr. MacArthur.

01:26:40.633 --> 01:26:42.967
I was just admiring
some of your handiwork.

01:26:42.969 --> 01:26:44.235
So was I.

01:26:44.237 --> 01:26:45.770
The Senator will hunt you
to the ends of the fucking

01:26:45.772 --> 01:26:47.705
Earth for that drive.

01:26:47.707 --> 01:26:49.340
So why don't we
create some terms

01:26:49.342 --> 01:26:50.975
to arrange its return, huh?

01:26:50.977 --> 01:26:52.376
What do you say?

01:26:52.378 --> 01:26:55.780
We're both reasonable
parties here.

01:26:55.782 --> 01:26:57.848
Well, reasonable
isn't the word I'd use

01:26:57.850 --> 01:27:00.017
to describe what I'm seeing.

01:27:00.019 --> 01:27:01.619
Do you understand me?

01:27:01.621 --> 01:27:03.454
No, you understand me.

01:27:03.456 --> 01:27:06.691
No, I've spent six years
hiding in the darkness.

01:27:06.693 --> 01:27:08.693
It's time to come
back into the light.

01:27:19.071 --> 01:27:20.438
I'm sorry, sir,

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:21.939
but I don't have it.

01:27:21.941 --> 01:27:24.809
Mr. Washington and
the others failed.

01:27:24.811 --> 01:27:27.878
Have they been
appropriately dealt with?

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:30.715
Alex saw to that for us.

01:27:30.717 --> 01:27:33.184
All other loose ends
are being tied up now.

01:27:33.186 --> 01:27:34.919
With the exception of the drive.

01:27:34.921 --> 01:27:36.320
Alexis has it, doesn't she?

01:27:41.226 --> 01:27:44.428
She and BAC are going to
be the bane of my run.

01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:47.565
BAC is just a bunch
of greedy warmongers.

01:27:47.567 --> 01:27:49.533
Well,
sir, greed and warmongering

01:27:49.535 --> 01:27:51.168
tend to go hand in
hand when dealing

01:27:51.170 --> 01:27:54.338
with defense contractors.

01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:57.108
I suppose.

01:27:57.110 --> 01:28:01.178
Is Alexis going to be
greedy too or a martyr?

01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:02.613
Well, she already

01:28:02.615 --> 01:28:04.749
has the diamonds, sir,
so if I'm not mistaken,

01:28:04.751 --> 01:28:07.418
I believe that she
just declared war.

01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:08.420
A martyr, then.

01:28:12.591 --> 01:28:17.061
You know what you have to
be to be a martyr, Doug?

01:28:17.063 --> 01:28:19.797
No, sir.

01:28:19.799 --> 01:28:20.799
Dead.

01:28:21.305 --> 01:28:27.796
