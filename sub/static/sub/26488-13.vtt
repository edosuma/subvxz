[loud whooshing]

00:34.991 --> 00:36.688
[elevator bell dings]

00:36.732 --> 00:38.386
Have we confirmed
the type of bomb?

00:38.429 --> 00:40.562
Preliminary forensics
indicate a CBU-87

00:40.605 --> 00:42.085
anti-personnel
submunition dispenser.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.652
Conventionally known
as a cluster bomb.

00:43.695 --> 00:46.002
Yeah, and the U.S. houses
the only company in the world

00:46.046 --> 00:47.177
that manufactures it.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.744
A weapon we provide
only to Israel.

00:48.787 --> 00:51.094
Which means our closest
Mideast ally just implicated us

00:51.138 --> 00:53.531
in a massacre that took the
lives of 29 innocent children,

00:53.575 --> 00:55.620
and if we provided the weapon,
we're on the hook.

00:55.664 --> 00:59.581
Call the Israeli Embassy.
Get Ambassador Dworsky in here.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.148
Ma'am, we've been trying.
He's incommunicado.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.671
Well, then we're gonna have to

01:02.714 --> 01:05.761
get him on the fly because,
Jay, I got to brief POTUS.

01:05.804 --> 01:08.155
Will you bring our congressional
allies into the loop?

01:08.198 --> 01:09.112
Yes, Madam Secretary.Okay.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.461
Kat?
Yes.
Yes.

01:10.505 --> 01:13.551
And Blake. Want you
to reach out to the families

01:13.595 --> 01:15.727
of those children. I mean,

01:15.771 --> 01:17.816
burial logistics,
humanitarian relief,

01:17.860 --> 01:19.818
whatever we can do
to show our solidarity.

01:19.862 --> 01:22.430
KAT and BLAKE:
Yes, ma'am.Stay on point.

01:22.473 --> 01:23.996
[elevator bell dings]Acknowledge the tragedy,

01:24.040 --> 01:25.911
but no acceptance
of responsibility

01:25.955 --> 01:27.826
until it has been
thoroughly investigated, okay?

01:27.870 --> 01:29.611
Statement for your review
to that very effect.

01:29.654 --> 01:32.222
Okay.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.398
Yeah, yeah. Th-That's g-good.
Get that out.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.965
Okay?

01:36.008 --> 01:37.140
MATT: Before
you send it out...

01:37.184 --> 01:38.663
Hey, listen,
this is a priority, okay?

01:38.707 --> 01:39.664
Everything else

01:39.708 --> 01:42.537

WOMAN: American imperialism
has to stop!

01:50.414 --> 01:53.200
We are the world's bully. Wait!

01:53.243 --> 01:55.680
Hey! Hey, you work with
the White House, right?

01:55.724 --> 01:58.814
I'm just a guy trying
to meet his step quota.

01:58.857 --> 02:01.643
Ladies and gentlemen,
one of the architects

02:01.686 --> 02:02.818
of our immoral
foreign policy.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.036
If you'll excuse me...

02:04.080 --> 02:06.517
No, I will not excuse you.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.128
Neither will the children
you bombed.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.781
Oh, my God, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.566
I have a right to my opinion.

02:11.609 --> 02:13.742
I'm not saying you don't,
but while you're out here

02:13.785 --> 02:16.571
smearing us,
I'm in there 16 hours a day

02:16.614 --> 02:19.226
actually trying to fix some of
the things you're raving about.

02:19.269 --> 02:22.577
An American-made
cluster bomb!

02:22.620 --> 02:25.145
RUSSELL: This is your
issue du jour, right?

02:25.188 --> 02:26.668
Yesterday it was
Social Security.

02:26.711 --> 02:29.671
Last week, what,
the vaccine conspiracy.

02:29.714 --> 02:31.499
I'm holding government
accountable.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.457
Who's holding you accountable?

02:33.501 --> 02:34.850
Well, certainly not
a government lackey.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.895
Let me tell you a thing or two
about this lackey.

02:36.939 --> 02:40.334
[door shuts]Syria is a dumpster fire,
Mr. President.

02:40.377 --> 02:43.250
You got the oppressive
Nussir regime

02:43.293 --> 02:46.427
locked in a brutal civil war
with rebel forces.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.907
Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah

02:48.951 --> 02:50.909
supporting the government.
The opposition forces

02:50.953 --> 02:53.999
are backed by a U.S.-led
Western coalition.

02:54.043 --> 02:58.047
Meanwhile, Iran's smuggling
arms to Israel's enemies

02:58.090 --> 03:00.354
through the country
and Israel's bombing the convoys

03:00.397 --> 03:02.660
as fast as it can.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.662
Syria and Israel
are still technically

03:04.706 --> 03:06.098
in a state of war.

03:06.142 --> 03:08.927
Russia is trying to expand
its role in the region.

03:08.971 --> 03:11.060
You got Shiites
and Sunnis

03:11.103 --> 03:13.367
and a rising tide
of Islamic terrorism.

03:13.410 --> 03:14.933
I'd need a weekend retreat
to talk about

03:14.977 --> 03:16.108
the human rights
violations and...

03:16.152 --> 03:17.849
ELIZABETH:
Basically,

03:17.893 --> 03:20.374
U.S. and Russia
are using client states

03:20.417 --> 03:23.246
to control an unstable region.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.379
Danger is that
the proxies drag us

03:25.422 --> 03:27.294
into a conflict
with Russia.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.599
Concise.

03:28.643 --> 03:29.905
Here to help.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.254
BECKER: Russia's already
using this incident

03:31.298 --> 03:32.690
as a pretext

03:32.734 --> 03:34.910
to expand military support
to Syria.

03:34.953 --> 03:37.608
If Russia gets more
involved with Syria...

03:37.652 --> 03:39.436
We have to back Israel,
which increases the risk

03:39.480 --> 03:41.133
of an American conflict
with Russia.

03:41.177 --> 03:44.180
Which it's bedrock
U.S. policy to avoid.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.662
Dozens of dead children?
There has to be accountability.

03:47.705 --> 03:49.707
Bess, what do we hear
from the Israelis?

03:49.751 --> 03:51.840
I've summoned Ambassador
Dworsky. I'll get his side.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.407
Well, get it fast.

03:53.450 --> 03:55.409
Henry, you familiar with the
Convention on Cluster Munitions

03:55.452 --> 03:57.889
banning the use
of this type of weapon?

03:57.933 --> 04:01.328
Yes, sir. 120 signatories
around the world,

04:01.371 --> 04:03.373
excluding the United States
and Russia.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.854
Well, I'd like you
to red team this,

04:05.897 --> 04:08.378
get with DNI. I want
to know how this happened.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.032
Tragedy of this dimension
means that we need

04:10.075 --> 04:12.077
to re-evaluate our stance here.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.296
BECKER:
Mr. President,

04:13.340 --> 04:15.385
not to minimize
the human toll here,

04:15.429 --> 04:17.953
but this question has been
asked and answered.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.781
Resoundingly. U.S. policy
is not to limit

04:19.824 --> 04:22.523
the weapons
at our disposal.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.916
Folks, I value your input,

04:24.960 --> 04:27.049
but let's save it
for your roundtable.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.093
Thank you.Yes, sir.

04:28.137 --> 04:29.138
Yes, sir.

04:30.922 --> 04:34.796
I'll be rolling calls on this
cluster bomb debacle, Adele,

04:34.839 --> 04:37.407
so no interruptions.
If it ain't DEFCON 1,

04:37.451 --> 04:39.191
not a peep.Yes, sir.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.889
That goes for all birds.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.849
I have to show him, don't I?

04:49.419 --> 04:52.901
[knocking on door]What did I just say?

04:52.944 --> 04:56.078
I know. I'm sorry.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.949
RUSSELL: Nothing but
crackpot notions.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.168
WOMAN:
Excuse me.

04:59.211 --> 05:01.039
No, I'm not calling you
a crackpot.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.303
There's plenty of well-adjusted,
sane individuals

05:03.346 --> 05:04.826
who set up tents
around the White House.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.871
WOMAN:
I have a right to be here.

05:06.915 --> 05:10.484
Yes, you do, where
criticizing is easy.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.486
Governing is hard.

05:12.529 --> 05:15.663
Put that on your
next sign and smoke it.

05:15.706 --> 05:19.406
That...

05:19.449 --> 05:21.843
that is taken completely
out of context.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.323
She accosted me.

05:24.672 --> 05:25.934
Oh, my God, I look like

05:25.977 --> 05:27.762
I'm berating a homeless woman

05:27.805 --> 05:29.329
for having the nerve
to talk to me.

05:29.372 --> 05:30.852
You know what?
I will handle this.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.070
Please.[cell phone ringing]

05:32.114 --> 05:33.898
I don't have time
for this nonsense.

05:33.942 --> 05:36.814
Carol.

05:36.858 --> 05:39.121
This is all over
the Internet, isn't it?

05:39.164 --> 05:41.166
[cell phone continues ringing]

05:43.212 --> 05:45.910
Hi, sweetheart. What?

05:45.954 --> 05:48.696
No, I was drinking decaf.

05:48.739 --> 05:52.264
Yes. Of course I know that-that
getting into shouting matches

05:52.308 --> 05:54.919
with strangers is bad
for my blood pressure.

05:54.963 --> 05:58.096
I do not have an
anger management problem!

05:58.140 --> 06:02.231
KAT: The United States would
like to extend our condolences

06:02.274 --> 06:03.885
for this tragedy.

06:03.928 --> 06:07.932
[interpreter translating
in Arabic]

06:07.976 --> 06:09.238
Thank you.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.414
Um, we would also like
to connect the families

06:11.458 --> 06:13.329
who have lost children with NGOs

06:13.373 --> 06:14.678
who can
provide support.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.027
Yes. They can defray
funeral costs.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.378
They can assist
with asylum claims.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.858
[speaking Arabic]

06:20.902 --> 06:22.120
What about our children?

06:23.078 --> 06:25.428
We're expressing
our deepest sympathies.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.000
Sympathies.

06:32.043 --> 06:35.046
For an American-made bomb
that murdered our sons,

06:35.090 --> 06:37.788
that took the flowers
from our garden,

06:37.832 --> 06:40.443
the light from our lives.

06:40.487 --> 06:44.447
We don't want NGOs.
We want justice.

06:44.491 --> 06:48.059
We want our children back.
Can you give us these things?

06:52.107 --> 06:54.109
[speaking Arabic]

06:58.418 --> 07:00.681
Uh, ma'am,
I have Alison for you.

07:00.724 --> 07:04.162
[sighs] Hey, kiddo,
little busy here.

07:04.206 --> 07:06.904
Mom, the Internet is slow,
like Stone Age slow.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.472
Well, call our provider.

07:09.516 --> 07:10.821
They keep you on the phone
forever,

07:10.865 --> 07:12.170
and my paper on Givenchy
is due tomorrow.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.000
Try the library.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.915
They have Internet and helpful,

07:17.959 --> 07:19.917
smiling people who aren't trying
to save the world order

07:19.961 --> 07:21.136
from crumbling.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.920
Bye, Ali.

07:22.964 --> 07:26.402
Jason, do you know how
to fix the Internet?

07:26.446 --> 07:29.840
Well, the open-source culture
generally doesn't mesh well

07:29.884 --> 07:33.365
with WPA supplicant
configuration files.

07:33.409 --> 07:35.411
So...

07:37.195 --> 07:39.154
I'm not accusing you
of anything, Ambassador Dworsky.

07:39.197 --> 07:42.113
I'm asking for
an explanation.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.506
And I'm giving you one.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.204
The IDF is not in the habit
of bombing children.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.423
I never said habit.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.078
I'm hoping it was an accident.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.167
The world will see it
as a war crime.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.256
ELIZABETH: Precipitated by
a weapon we only provide

07:54.299 --> 07:55.866
to Israel.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.129
Meaning the burden of proof
is on your country to establish

07:58.173 --> 08:01.959
that it had no involvement
in this bombing.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.439
And if we can't
prove a negative?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.267
First things first.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.269
Syria is now
an Israeli no-fly zone.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.663
And all shipments

08:09.706 --> 08:13.057
of the CBU-87 will be suspended
pending our investigation.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.320
So now the U.S.
is doing Iran's bidding.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.802
Ambassador Dworsky...If America handcuffs us,

08:18.846 --> 08:22.458
Iran will have carte blanche
to expand its military presence

08:22.502 --> 08:24.591
in Syria and continue
arming our enemies.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.941
United States
won't let that happen,

08:26.984 --> 08:29.552
Mr. Ambassador.Let it happen?

08:29.596 --> 08:32.642
You're facilitating it
by helping Iran scapegoat us.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.862
We're simply asking

08:34.905 --> 08:37.386
for you to put a moratorium
on IDF sorties

08:37.429 --> 08:39.736
until we can get
to the bottom of this.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.347
And will there be a moratorium
on Iranian arms convoys?

08:42.391 --> 08:44.088
On the build-out of
Iranian infrastructure

08:44.132 --> 08:46.830
just miles from Tel Aviv?

08:46.874 --> 08:48.528
If America's
not willing

08:48.571 --> 08:52.096
to defend us, then we will
defend ourselves.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.315
Good day, Madam Secretary.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.235
Cluster bombs have an important
strategic role to play

09:00.278 --> 09:02.454
in U.S. military policy.
By dispersing

09:02.498 --> 09:03.978
multiple packets at once,

09:04.021 --> 09:06.197
they allow us
to neutralize vehicles

09:06.241 --> 09:09.070
and enemy personnel
in a single blast.

09:09.113 --> 09:12.552
You know, and more to the point,
Moscow uses them, so we have to.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.728
Yeah, tell that to the parents
of the 29 children.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.860
It's about mutual
deterrence, Henry.

09:16.904 --> 09:19.036
Gifting the Russians
a strategic advantage

09:19.080 --> 09:21.386
risks asymmetric warfare.We're talking about

09:21.430 --> 09:23.432
an anti-personnel weapon
whose sole purpose it is

09:23.475 --> 09:25.869
to maximize carnage and death.Okay, come on,

09:25.913 --> 09:28.089
Henry, every weapon
in creation has that goal.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.265
It's not the tool,
it's how it's used.
Okay.

09:30.308 --> 09:33.224
So we should build in
additional safeguards.Yes.

09:33.268 --> 09:35.618
Like imposing more
stringent rules

09:35.662 --> 09:38.665
of engagement on Israel,
which we can discuss.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.884
I'm aware of the strategic
and military concerns,

09:40.928 --> 09:43.191
but there are serious
ethical considerations

09:43.234 --> 09:44.540
that we've got
to take into account.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.543
98% of submunition casualties

09:47.587 --> 09:49.501
around the globe are civilian.

09:49.545 --> 09:52.635
98%.
All right.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.115
All valid points.

09:54.158 --> 09:57.292
We need to find out
what happened,

09:57.335 --> 09:58.946
move this conversation forward,

09:58.989 --> 10:01.949
and provide POTUS
with a swift recommendation.

HENRY: Russell, in terms
of a timetable...

10:03.385 --> 10:05.343
I'm not rushing
you, Henry.

10:05.387 --> 10:07.563
This should be done
as quickly as possible,

10:07.607 --> 10:10.697
but not quicker.[cell phones ringing, buzzing]

taken nine hours ago

10:15.179 --> 10:19.357
of the Russian-operated Khmeimim
Air Base in northwestern Syria.

10:19.401 --> 10:22.752
What you see here is a Syrian
MiG-29 taxiing on the runway.

10:25.276 --> 10:27.017
It's hardly news that
the Syrian Air Force

10:27.061 --> 10:29.063
uses Russian air bases.Uh, yes, sir.

10:29.106 --> 10:33.197
But the flight trajectory
of this plane is telling.

10:33.241 --> 10:36.070
What you see now
is a payload being dropped

10:36.113 --> 10:40.161
at a ceiling of 15,000 feet.
Namely, a CBU-87.

10:40.204 --> 10:43.164
Its laser-guided target

10:43.207 --> 10:46.167
is an abandoned lot.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.386
This video is
time-stamped 11 seconds

10:48.430 --> 10:53.087
before that cluster bomb
detonated on those kids.

10:53.130 --> 10:58.266
I'll spare you the visual
of the impact.

10:58.309 --> 10:59.963
So the cluster bomb was
dropped from a Syrian plane

11:00.007 --> 11:01.486
that took off from
a Russian base.

11:01.530 --> 11:05.360
Meaning that Israel was right
about being framed.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.014
They just had the wrong culprit.

11:07.057 --> 11:08.145
It wasn't Iran.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.625
It was Russia and Syria.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.931
Ephraim, I'd like to know
how the hell

11:10.974 --> 11:12.367
Syria got ahold of one
of our cluster bombs.

11:12.410 --> 11:13.890
We're still working
that out, sir.
Mr. President,

11:13.934 --> 11:16.719
we have a more pressing
problem now.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.156
Russia. It's one thing
to coordinate with a proxy.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.767
BECKER: It's another
to collaborate with them

11:20.810 --> 11:22.812
to frame our chief
U.S. ally in the region.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.640

uses this incident

11:24.684 --> 11:26.337
to get more closely
involved in the region,

11:26.381 --> 11:27.817
it could tip the
balance of power.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.559
I'm not gonna tolerate any more
Russian expansionism.

11:30.602 --> 11:33.257
It's time we had a tough
discussion with Syria.

11:33.301 --> 11:36.870
A country with whom we have
no diplomatic relations.

Yep.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.179

to determine what batch
the cluster bomb was from.

allegations of plagiarism.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.301
Um, she was eventually cleared,
but by that time

18:05.345 --> 18:06.868
she'd been drummed out
of academia.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.522

Well, I don't think
this McCord is

18:24.364 --> 18:26.105

quite yet.

18:26.148 --> 18:29.760
Per Ephraim, preliminary
analysis of the bomb fragments

18:29.804 --> 18:34.635
confirms the alloy
was Russian in origin.

18:34.678 --> 18:37.942
Are you saying the cluster bomb
was a Russian knockoff?Yep.

18:37.986 --> 18:41.424
So, if this was all just
Russia and Syria

18:41.468 --> 18:45.689

we're off the hook.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.169
Uh, slow down, Russell.

18:47.213 --> 18:50.390
The metallurgical analysis
doesn't exonerate us.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.218

replicated the CBU-87,

the weapon schematics.

could be dirty.

still have blood on its hands.[sighs]

of Dynametrics' culpability.

Have we heard from the Israelis?

19:22.204 --> 19:24.206
The Israelis didn't
destroy the plane, sir.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.643
Syria did.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.602
Friendly fire?

19:28.645 --> 19:30.865
It would appear so.[sighs]

19:30.908 --> 19:32.693
Well, I don't care if
it was an act of God.

19:32.736 --> 19:36.000
Russian soldiers dead,
Moscow will respond.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.873
Meaning the situation is
deteriorating fast.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.918
If proxies are blowing
their principals' planes

19:40.962 --> 19:44.226
out of the sky, the situation's
untenable for everyone.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.967
Which could give us
an opening.

19:46.010 --> 19:49.666
Get with Avdonin, Bess,
before that opening closes.Yes, sir.

19:54.802 --> 19:57.892
Thank you for meeting with me,
Mr. Foreign Minister.

19:57.935 --> 20:01.548
I was stateside to tour
consulates when you reached out.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.419
I thought a sit-down
would be fruitful.

20:03.463 --> 20:04.986
I thought so, too.

20:05.029 --> 20:08.468
This friendly fire incident
underscores the peril

20:08.511 --> 20:10.383
we now find ourselves in,

20:10.426 --> 20:14.387
and how easily the chaos
could draw our two countries

20:14.430 --> 20:17.259
into direct conflict.I agree.

20:17.303 --> 20:21.350
Especially since it wasn't
friendly fire.

20:21.394 --> 20:25.398
Intel on the flight path
of an Israeli F-16 jet,

20:25.441 --> 20:30.968
which establishes it
deliberately flew behind

20:31.012 --> 20:34.233
our transport plane
the moment a Syrian battery

20:34.276 --> 20:36.757
locked onto the
Israeli intruder.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.193
Israel murdered our soldiers.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.674
DWORSKY:
We followed the protocols.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.806
Moscow was given
a 60-second warning

20:42.850 --> 20:45.592
before we entered
Syrian air space.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.550
Was apprised of
our flight pattern,

20:47.594 --> 20:49.987
our mission objective.Oh, I think we both know

20:50.031 --> 20:53.426
what Israel's true intentions
were, Mr. Ambassador.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.079
Given the lengths
Russia and Syria went

20:55.123 --> 20:58.300
to frame Israel
for that cluster bomb,

20:58.344 --> 21:00.694
it seems like poetic justice

21:00.737 --> 21:04.741
to see Moscow's client state
shoot down a Russian plane.

21:04.785 --> 21:08.005
KONSTANTIN: This treachery was precipitated

21:08.049 --> 21:10.269
at the direction
of the United States.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.531
That's a fabrication.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.446
And you want to talk
about treachery?

21:13.489 --> 21:16.231
How about Russia forging
a U.S. bomb,

21:16.275 --> 21:18.755
and giving it to Syria
to murder children?

21:18.799 --> 21:19.930
And doing it all

21:19.974 --> 21:21.323
to frame the U.S.?

21:21.367 --> 21:23.499
Even if that fantasy
were true,

21:23.543 --> 21:27.503
it hardly justifies a conspiracy
to kill Russian soldiers.

21:27.547 --> 21:28.852
ELIZABETH:
We need to de-escalate.

21:28.896 --> 21:30.506
Israel has to issue a statement

21:30.550 --> 21:32.421
acknowledging
its role in this crisis.

21:32.465 --> 21:33.857
DWORSKY:
What role?

21:33.901 --> 21:35.424
The role of defending
our tiny country

21:35.468 --> 21:38.384
against a swarm of enemies
backed by Moscow?

21:38.427 --> 21:40.777
KONSTANTIN:
In light of this aggression,

21:40.821 --> 21:42.518
Russia will be supplying Syria

21:42.562 --> 21:44.259
with an upgraded
air defense system.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.696
DWORSKY:
If Russia is augmenting

21:46.740 --> 21:50.874
Syria's military capabilities,
we demand the latest

21:50.918 --> 21:52.398
in U.S. technology...

21:52.441 --> 21:55.662
So you want us to put you
on a war footing with Syria.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.446
We won't sanction an arms race.

21:57.490 --> 21:58.882
The U.S. has always

21:58.926 --> 22:02.059
used Israel as a pawn
for America's agenda.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.148
You give us weapons,

22:04.192 --> 22:07.195
then handcuff us when
we try to use them.

22:07.238 --> 22:09.763
Give us money,
but tell us how to spend it.

22:09.806 --> 22:13.027
Thank you very much,
but we are the ones at risk.

22:13.070 --> 22:15.899
And we know how to
protect ourselves.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.510
KONSTANTIN:
Russia will not tolerate

22:17.553 --> 22:20.339
the murder of its citizens.

22:20.382 --> 22:23.342
An immediate response
will be forthcoming.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.653
RUSSELL:
So we're sure

22:30.697 --> 22:34.440
Russia wasn't given
the schematics for the CBU-87?

22:34.483 --> 22:37.007
Yes. According
to our investigation,

22:37.051 --> 22:39.053
there was no malfeasance,
just negligence.

22:39.096 --> 22:41.011
More like gross negligence,

22:41.055 --> 22:42.491
behind DOD's back.

22:42.535 --> 22:45.146
Dynametrics gutted
their cyber security budget

22:45.189 --> 22:47.540
so they could undercut
competitors on government bids.

22:47.583 --> 22:50.978
In the process, creating
vulnerabilities Russia exploited

22:51.021 --> 22:53.633
by hacking the
company's database.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.635
Thanks, Ephraim.

22:58.855 --> 23:01.641
Well, thank God we're not
looking at treason here.

23:01.684 --> 23:04.861
Well, cutting corners
is no cause for celebration.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.689
Dynametrics's
digital infrastructure

23:06.733 --> 23:09.518
is woefully underfunded
and just this side of legal.

23:09.562 --> 23:13.653
Agreed, but as long
as they played by the rules...

23:13.696 --> 23:16.830
You can technically play by
the rules and still be at fault.

23:16.873 --> 23:18.266
That's what ethics
are all about.

23:18.309 --> 23:20.834
Well, you can put it all
in your report.

23:20.877 --> 23:24.490
Speaking of which,
how's it coming?

23:24.533 --> 23:26.709
It-it's evolving.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.842
Evolving.

23:28.885 --> 23:32.846
Right. You know,

23:32.889 --> 23:35.979
there's a lot at stake here.

23:36.023 --> 23:40.897
After having refused to sign
on to the cluster bomb ban,

23:40.941 --> 23:43.552
an about-face in the wake
of a single tragedy

23:43.596 --> 23:46.468
could be seen
as an admission of wrongdoing.

23:48.252 --> 23:51.212
Or as an assumption
of moral responsibility.

23:51.255 --> 23:52.431
Moral responsibility

23:52.474 --> 23:54.694
has its costs.

23:54.737 --> 23:56.783
One of which will be
to tar the president.

23:58.611 --> 24:02.005
And the Secretary of State.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.055
BLAKE: New proposals
to help the relatives

24:08.098 --> 24:10.187
of the dead children.
I tried to get creative.

24:10.231 --> 24:13.669
Uh-huh, by reallocating
some of our UNHCR funds

24:13.713 --> 24:16.280
for housing allowances
to the affected families.

24:16.324 --> 24:18.979
Exactly.Except this isn't
a refugee crisis.

24:19.022 --> 24:21.721
Homes weren't destroyed;
Foreign Affairs won't sign off.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.768
Okay.

24:25.812 --> 24:28.815
What about relocating the
bereaved out of the war zone?

24:28.858 --> 24:31.339
How do we justify
preferential treatment

24:31.382 --> 24:32.906
when thousands of civilians
have already perished?

24:32.949 --> 24:35.256
It's not preferential treatment.
It's a mission of mercy.

24:35.299 --> 24:37.737
Driven by American guilt
over the use of a cluster bomb

24:37.780 --> 24:39.739
we didn't even manufacture,
meaning it's back

24:39.782 --> 24:41.654
to the drawing board.Back to the drawing board.

24:43.699 --> 24:46.485
This is your carrel.

24:46.528 --> 24:49.792
It's got a nameplate.
It says "Maggie Brixton."

24:51.751 --> 24:53.361
You got me a desk?

24:53.404 --> 24:57.408
Yes. And the administration has
received assurances that you can

24:57.452 --> 25:00.629
do as much reading and writing
here as you want, undisturbed.

25:00.673 --> 25:05.591
And you think this trivial
gesture will buy my silence?

25:05.634 --> 25:07.114
There's...

25:07.157 --> 25:09.029
there's no quid pro quo here.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.857
You bet there's not.

25:10.900 --> 25:13.120
Because I am
only getting started.

25:13.163 --> 25:16.645
The Dalton administration
will not silence me.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.429
Yeah, one sign a day,

25:18.473 --> 25:20.823
that's too much for you?
How about ten?Uh, Stevie...

25:20.867 --> 25:23.434
You will be held to account

25:23.478 --> 25:25.045
for every transgression.

25:25.088 --> 25:27.003
Every moral failing, every act
of greed, because this...

25:27.047 --> 25:29.702
Stevie, now.
Just wait. Wait.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.921
...t-this...

25:31.965 --> 25:36.578
this is, t-the type
of control mechanism

25:36.622 --> 25:38.798
that every
government,

25:38.841 --> 25:40.843
every despot...

25:51.637 --> 25:53.595
Okay. We can go now.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.514
ELIZABETH:
You okay?

25:59.558 --> 26:02.517
Yeah, I'm just t-trying to wrap
my head around normalizing

26:02.561 --> 26:05.781
an acceptable level
of dead children.

26:05.825 --> 26:10.046
Well, you're no stranger
to collateral damage.

26:10.090 --> 26:12.701
You were a fighter pilot.

26:12.745 --> 26:15.225
Yes, and I knew that innocents

26:15.269 --> 26:17.619
would inevitably
be caught in the crossfire--

26:17.663 --> 26:19.969
that's something
I'm still trying to reconcile--

26:20.013 --> 26:22.581
but it's one thing
to follow orders,

26:22.624 --> 26:24.844
it's another to sanction weapons
that you know

26:24.887 --> 26:26.846
will result in the death
of civilians.

26:26.889 --> 26:30.458
Cluster bombs
indiscriminately kill people.

26:30.501 --> 26:32.547
That's kind of what
they're all about.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.114
Which is why we need diplomacy.

26:34.157 --> 26:37.770
Yeah, well, diplomacy's
not working right now.

26:37.813 --> 26:41.556
Syria's about to open up
a front against Israel

26:41.600 --> 26:46.343
and Iran is stepping up arms
shipments to Hezbollah

26:46.387 --> 26:47.780
and it's just...[stammers]

26:47.823 --> 26:49.608
Sorry.W-Where are you with Russia?

26:49.651 --> 26:52.132
A whole bunch of nyet.

26:52.175 --> 26:54.134
[sighs]

26:54.177 --> 26:56.310
I'm meeting with
the president, joint chiefs

26:56.353 --> 26:59.618
first thing in
the morning, but...

26:59.661 --> 27:02.838
You have got to be kidding me.

27:02.882 --> 27:03.970
What?Our electric bill.

27:04.013 --> 27:07.190
It's, like, 800
last month to 2,000?

27:07.234 --> 27:08.627
Jason?
Jason?

27:10.933 --> 27:12.848
Come here.

27:14.241 --> 27:16.417
Hi.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.811
See, this is why we should
all be using solar power.

27:18.854 --> 27:21.770
Oh, yes, well, until
that time, your little

27:21.814 --> 27:25.644
cryptocurrency escapade is gonna
drive us into bankruptcy.

27:25.687 --> 27:28.647
Meaning that you're gonna pay us
the difference between this

27:28.690 --> 27:30.823
and last month's bill.

27:30.866 --> 27:32.215
1,200 bucks.JASON:
Fine.

27:32.259 --> 27:34.348
I will wire you the equivalent
in SpectroCoin.

27:34.391 --> 27:35.566
No, no. Uhp.
No, no.

27:35.610 --> 27:36.785
Cash on the barrel.

27:36.829 --> 27:40.397
How about you cover
the power bill,

27:40.441 --> 27:43.226
and I will cut you in
on my profits?

27:43.270 --> 27:44.314
And you can
think of that

27:44.358 --> 27:46.055
as an investment.

27:46.099 --> 27:48.536
We've already invested
in you for 17 years, sport.

27:48.579 --> 27:50.538
And it's about to pay off.
SpectroCoin is up 300%

27:50.581 --> 27:52.322
this week alone.Oh, that's great.

27:52.366 --> 27:55.891
Then you can sell some of your
booty and fork over the dough.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.373
[sighs]

27:59.416 --> 28:01.070
This is not how the Zuckerbergs
supported their kid.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.463
[phone ringing]

28:02.506 --> 28:04.595
Ay...

28:06.772 --> 28:07.729
Russell, hi.

28:07.773 --> 28:08.730
RUSSELL:
Russia is sending

28:08.774 --> 28:10.558
their Northern Fleet to Latakia,

28:10.601 --> 28:11.951
Syria's most important harbor.

28:11.994 --> 28:13.474
What?

28:13.517 --> 28:14.867
It's one big setup.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.869
The cluster bomb,
Moscow's response

28:16.912 --> 28:18.218
to Syria's destruction
of their plane...

28:18.261 --> 28:19.828
It's all to create leverage.

28:19.872 --> 28:21.438
They want a Mediterranean port.

28:21.482 --> 28:22.831
Yeah, and the president's not

28:22.875 --> 28:25.138
gonna allow that,
no matter what.

28:25.181 --> 28:26.661
I'm on my way.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.880
How bad?

28:27.923 --> 28:31.100
Don't wait on me for breakfast.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.370
It's an armada.
Yes, sir.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.633
And once their Northern
Fleet is in position,

28:42.677 --> 28:44.984
we won't be able to dislodge it
without a war.

28:45.027 --> 28:47.726
Bess, what do we hear
from your counterpart?

28:47.769 --> 28:49.728
Avdonin insists

28:49.771 --> 28:51.686
that an increased
naval presence is necessary

28:51.730 --> 28:54.602
to counter American
and Israeli aggressions.

28:54.645 --> 28:56.822
ELLEN: It's
a pretext.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.649
Russia has a small naval
facility in Tartus

28:58.693 --> 29:01.435
that whet their appetite
for regional domination.

29:01.478 --> 29:03.045
And this fleet
will give it to them.Yes, sir.

29:03.089 --> 29:06.135
And if we don't push Russia
back now, they will have a port

29:06.179 --> 29:10.270
that puts them a stone's throw
from vital NATO bases in Turkey.

29:10.313 --> 29:12.272
BECKER: I recommend
that we send

29:12.315 --> 29:14.404
a fleet to intercept
Russia's advance.

29:14.448 --> 29:18.974
Which will put us on the verge
of direct military conflict.

29:19.018 --> 29:21.411
Only if Russia doesn't blink.
We have to hope they do.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.764
Gordon's right.
We have very little choice here.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.029
How far out
is the Northern Fleet?

29:30.072 --> 29:32.640
About 26 hours.
Our Eighth Fleet needs

29:32.683 --> 29:34.816
about eight hours' advance
notice to intercept them.

29:34.860 --> 29:38.733
We've got 18 hours
to get Russia to stand down.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.909
HENRY: Have you informed the president

29:40.953 --> 29:43.564
about Dynametrics's
negligence in this?

29:43.607 --> 29:46.915
Uh, not yet. But you should
include it in your report.

29:46.959 --> 29:49.309
A report that you're going
to deliver to the president,

29:49.352 --> 29:51.833
who needs to know
his friend was at fault.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.966
He will be so apprised.

29:54.009 --> 29:58.057
Correct, because I'm gonna
tell him myself.

29:59.275 --> 30:03.192
Respectfully, Henry,
that's not SOP.

30:03.236 --> 30:05.542
Yeah, let's talk about SOP,
because you've been speeding

30:05.586 --> 30:07.631
the plough on my work
since the beginning.

30:07.675 --> 30:10.634
Weighing in on the importance
of not embarrassing

30:10.678 --> 30:13.550
the administration, tacitly
backing military prerogatives

30:13.594 --> 30:15.030
over ethical ones.

30:15.074 --> 30:18.033
You're not suggesting I wouldn't
provide the president

30:18.077 --> 30:20.819
an accurate summary
of your conclusions?

30:20.862 --> 30:22.168
It's not just
what you say,

30:22.211 --> 30:24.344
it's how you say it.

30:24.387 --> 30:26.563
Tone is substantive.

30:26.607 --> 30:29.218
Which is why I can't allow you
to mediate my advice,

30:29.262 --> 30:30.916
whitewash things.

30:30.959 --> 30:35.050
I know you think I'm working
against you, Henry, but I'm not.

30:35.094 --> 30:37.618
I'm working for the president.

30:37.661 --> 30:40.403
And it's my job to protect him

30:40.447 --> 30:41.970
and the administration.

30:42.014 --> 30:44.494
And it's my job not to care
about your job.

30:44.538 --> 30:47.497
You can't varnish
my advice, Russell.

30:47.541 --> 30:50.109
Not if I'm gonna
keep working here.

30:53.025 --> 30:55.984
[sighs]

30:56.028 --> 30:58.857
I'll set up
a one-on-one.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.641
Thank you.

31:02.077 --> 31:05.472
[door opens, closes]

31:08.910 --> 31:13.872
Thank you both for coming
on such short notice.

31:13.915 --> 31:17.179
You can dispense with
the courtesy, Madam Secretary.

31:17.223 --> 31:19.312
It was less an invitation
than a summons.

31:19.355 --> 31:22.402
Well, that's fine.
Neither of you need to talk.

31:27.059 --> 31:31.237
Effective immediately,
the Israeli government

31:31.280 --> 31:33.543
will cease all sorties
into Syrian airspace.

31:33.587 --> 31:36.198
You must be joking.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.635
And Syria will freeze
all Iranian arms shipments

31:38.679 --> 31:40.986
through its territory.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.944
Iran is an ally.
Syria will do no such thing.

31:42.988 --> 31:47.949
You will do it, Adnan,
or I will instigate

31:47.993 --> 31:51.300
an emergency session
of the U.N. Security Council,

31:51.344 --> 31:53.563
and present evidence
of Syria's collusion

31:53.607 --> 31:58.046
with Russia to murder children
for political gain.

31:58.090 --> 31:59.656
Your regime will have to answer

31:59.700 --> 32:01.267
to its own people
for the slaughter.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.095
You wouldn't dare.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.227
At that same
U.N. Security Council session,

32:05.271 --> 32:09.231
I will also present evidence
that Israel

32:09.275 --> 32:12.060
had a direct involvement
in the destruction

32:12.104 --> 32:13.670
of a Russian jet,

32:13.714 --> 32:16.325
and without plausible
deniability, you'll have to face

32:16.369 --> 32:18.501
Moscow's wrath.You must be mad.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.547
More like furious.

32:20.590 --> 32:23.463
Furious enough to throw you
both to the wolves

32:23.506 --> 32:25.291
by publicly
exposing you.

32:25.334 --> 32:28.076
But there are bigger
imperatives as stake,

32:28.120 --> 32:31.210
so the both of you
are going to stand down

32:31.253 --> 32:33.952
for the next 24 hours,
which I hope

32:33.995 --> 32:38.260
is enough time to avert
a war with Russia, a war

32:38.304 --> 32:41.437
the actions of your countries
put us on the brink of.

32:44.092 --> 32:45.137
Yes.
Yes.

32:50.838 --> 32:52.361
That'll be all.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.193
[Elizabeth sighs]

32:58.237 --> 32:59.890
Nina.

32:59.934 --> 33:01.414
Yes.Get me Henry.

33:01.457 --> 33:03.285
I need to talk to him before
he talks to the president.

33:03.329 --> 33:04.721
Right away, Madam Secretary.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.296
You're recommending
we sign on to

33:14.340 --> 33:16.603
the ban on
cluster bombs.Yeah, over the objection

33:16.646 --> 33:19.519
of Secretary Becker
and Ellen Hill.

33:19.562 --> 33:21.303
Strenuous
objection, I see.

33:21.347 --> 33:22.565
Conrad, it comes down
to this.

33:22.609 --> 33:24.785
How can we claim
moral leadership

33:24.828 --> 33:28.789
w-when we employ a weapon
that the rest of civilization

33:28.832 --> 33:31.313
has deemed
too barbaric to use?

33:31.357 --> 33:34.055
The benefits of having this...
tool in our arsenal

33:34.099 --> 33:37.798
are too small to offset
the risk of misuse

33:37.841 --> 33:40.192
and collateral damage,
the death of almost 30 children

33:40.235 --> 33:42.020
being a prime example.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.631
A powerful
moral argument.

33:44.674 --> 33:46.720
But Henry, when I asked
you to take this on,

33:46.763 --> 33:48.200
I didn't realize
the scope

33:48.243 --> 33:49.636
of Russia's involvement
in this mess.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.594
As long as Moscow
has the bomb,

33:51.638 --> 33:53.379
they have a
strategic advantage.

33:53.422 --> 33:54.728
Particularly if they're
willing to use it.

33:54.771 --> 33:55.946
And given current events,

33:55.990 --> 33:57.557
I won't cede
an inch to them.
I understand.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.820
But what if Moscow was willing
to sign on to the ban?

33:59.863 --> 34:02.736
And how precisely are we
going to get them to do that?

34:02.779 --> 34:04.346
Elizabeth has a plan.

34:04.390 --> 34:06.653
Which she's willing
to explore...
[exhales]

34:06.696 --> 34:09.264
...with your permission.

34:09.308 --> 34:11.527
Well, if Russia signs on,
I will too.

34:11.571 --> 34:13.225
I'll tell her.

34:13.268 --> 34:15.227
Thanks, Henry.

34:15.270 --> 34:17.359
And there is
something else.

34:17.403 --> 34:19.013
It has to do with my role here.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.364
I sometimes feel...

34:22.408 --> 34:23.844
pressured to rubberstamp
policies

34:23.887 --> 34:26.281
the administration
is inclined to pursue.

34:26.325 --> 34:27.674
Henry...

34:27.717 --> 34:30.677
you're an academic trapped
in a political world.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.896
I never said your job
was going to be easy.

34:32.940 --> 34:35.725
But I have to be able to push
back when my mandate

34:35.769 --> 34:37.684
is being compromised.And I expect
nothing less.

34:39.773 --> 34:42.819
Giving it to me straight
is what I hired you to do.Good.

34:42.863 --> 34:45.561
Because we need
to talk about Leland Grafton.

34:52.916 --> 34:54.701
[pages riffling]

34:54.744 --> 34:56.746
[exhales]

34:56.790 --> 35:00.185
Well, his company's
security lapses are...

35:00.228 --> 35:01.925
reckless.

35:01.969 --> 35:03.231
And troubling.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.843
But they're not criminal.

35:06.887 --> 35:08.280
No, sir.

35:08.323 --> 35:10.151
But I don't think someone
who avails himself

35:10.195 --> 35:12.675
of every conceivable loophole

35:12.719 --> 35:14.416
should be awarded
government contracts.

35:14.460 --> 35:17.506
You know I can't interfere
in the bidding process.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.378
No, but what you can do
is tell your old friend

35:19.421 --> 35:20.901
that it's time
for him to step down.

35:20.944 --> 35:22.642
Moral suasion.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.472
There's no one in the world
who's in a better position

35:26.515 --> 35:27.734
to exert it than you.

35:31.738 --> 35:34.828
My friend, we have had
a difficult year together.

35:34.871 --> 35:36.917
So let's talk
common ground, then.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.788
Because in the past year,
we've also found that.

35:38.832 --> 35:40.747
Nuclear de-escalation.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.575
No one ever thought
it could be done.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.533
But we agreed
to take our

35:44.577 --> 35:46.622
intercontinental
ballistic missiles off

35:46.666 --> 35:48.450
the hair-trigger
alert system.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.931
And the world is safer.It is.

35:50.974 --> 35:53.760
And yet here we are,
Konstantin.

35:53.803 --> 35:56.545
Hours away from a showdown
between our two fleets.

35:59.026 --> 36:02.290
And if somebody
fires a shot, if...

36:02.334 --> 36:05.598
intentions
are slightly misread...

36:05.641 --> 36:07.382
What do you propose?

36:07.426 --> 36:10.646
That we set an example
for our proxies.

36:10.690 --> 36:13.954
Instead of them provoking us,
we provoke them.

36:13.997 --> 36:16.826
You want us to join
you in signing on

36:16.870 --> 36:18.306
to the cluster
bomb ban?

36:18.350 --> 36:20.613
A public display
of cooperation.

36:20.656 --> 36:22.397
A gesture
that sets the stage

36:22.441 --> 36:24.878
for us to jointly
pull back our fleets.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.793
That's the first domino.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.795
What's the second?

36:28.838 --> 36:30.405
Moscow uses its influence
to roll back

36:30.449 --> 36:31.841
Iran's footprint in Syria.

36:31.885 --> 36:33.843
And what about your proxy?

36:33.887 --> 36:36.629
No, Israel will stay out
of Syria.

36:36.672 --> 36:39.240
And then Russia and the U.S.
will hold talks

36:39.284 --> 36:42.374
about limiting our involvement
in the Syrian civil war.

36:42.417 --> 36:45.246
And if we refuse these terms?

36:45.290 --> 36:47.683
Then even if we dodge
this bullet,

36:47.727 --> 36:49.598
it's a temporary reprieve.

36:49.642 --> 36:51.992
We have this illusion

36:52.035 --> 36:53.994
that our proxies are...

36:54.037 --> 36:55.778
our buffers.

36:55.822 --> 37:00.000
We can offload our conflicts.

37:00.043 --> 37:02.263
But we are our proxies.

37:02.307 --> 37:05.440
We hold each other
accountable for what they do.

37:05.484 --> 37:07.964
Meaning, if we don't
reign them in,

37:08.008 --> 37:11.533
our client states will
ultimately drag us into war.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.622
And we can stop that
from happening

37:13.666 --> 37:15.233
by setting an example,

37:15.276 --> 37:18.714
taking cluster bombs
off the table...

37:18.758 --> 37:21.456
reducing our involvement
in Syria.

37:21.500 --> 37:22.979
So...

37:23.023 --> 37:25.286
if the principals behave...

37:25.330 --> 37:27.549
the proxies will follow.Yes.

37:27.593 --> 37:29.986
We have to lead here,
Konstantin.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.727
Together.

37:31.771 --> 37:33.251
There is no other choice.

37:36.166 --> 37:38.952
Educational grants
for Syrian refugees

37:38.995 --> 37:40.910
and the names of each
of the dead children.

37:40.954 --> 37:43.304
Blake. [exhales]I know-- no
admissions of guilt.

37:43.348 --> 37:47.308
So we can de-link the grants
from policy issues.

37:47.352 --> 37:48.962
You're trying to ease
suffering with grand gestures,

37:49.005 --> 37:51.007
which is statecraft.Exactly.

37:51.051 --> 37:52.313
Yeah, but this
is different.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.315
This is soulcraft.

37:54.359 --> 37:55.708
And soulcraft...

37:55.751 --> 37:58.319
you can't assuage a loss
by giving someone something.

37:58.363 --> 38:02.105
You can only do it by preventing
something from being taken away.

38:04.151 --> 38:05.805
I'm sorry, I don't follow.It's okay.

38:05.848 --> 38:07.981
Come on, let's go.
I'll explain on the way.

38:09.330 --> 38:11.985
KAT: Hi. Thank you so much
for talking to us again.BLAKE: Hi.

38:12.028 --> 38:14.466
[both speaking Arabic]

38:14.509 --> 38:15.945
What is it you want?

38:15.989 --> 38:18.513
We have searched in vain
for ways to compensate you

38:18.557 --> 38:20.646
for the death of your sons.[interpreter
speaking Arabic]

38:20.689 --> 38:22.691
We realize the futility
of our efforts.

38:22.735 --> 38:26.695
Um, nothing we say or do can...
can ease your pain.

38:26.739 --> 38:29.959
But m-maybe there's
something else we can do.

38:30.003 --> 38:31.961
Uh, in your son's memory.[interpreter
speaking Arabic]

38:32.005 --> 38:33.746
In memory of all your boys.

38:33.789 --> 38:36.096
This is a letter
of intent signed by

38:36.139 --> 38:38.011
both the U.S. and Russia
in which both countries

38:38.054 --> 38:40.492
agree to join the ban
on cluster bombs.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.711
[speaking Arabic]

38:48.500 --> 38:50.197
So no more cluster bombs?

38:51.285 --> 38:53.287
No, ma'am.

38:54.984 --> 38:57.726
And the children who live
because of this ban will have

38:57.770 --> 38:59.946
your children to thank.[speaking Arabic]

39:02.165 --> 39:04.690
[speaking Arabic]

39:04.733 --> 39:06.039
Thank you.
[sobs]

39:07.954 --> 39:09.608
Global warming.

39:09.651 --> 39:13.133
The destruction
of the rain forest.

39:13.176 --> 39:17.050
President Dalton
is condemning us all.MAN: Yeah!

39:17.093 --> 39:18.747
I'm being punked, right?

39:18.791 --> 39:20.227
[men yelling on video]

39:20.270 --> 39:22.403
I tried, sir.
I swear.

39:22.447 --> 39:23.752
What about her carrel?

39:23.796 --> 39:25.754
Maggie loves it;
she's using it

39:25.798 --> 39:27.365
to do research
for her protests.

39:34.676 --> 39:36.504
Knock, knock.

39:37.984 --> 39:39.246
Oat milk latte.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.857
Extra hot.

39:41.901 --> 39:43.642
Consider this a peace offering.

39:43.685 --> 39:45.644
You can't buy
my silence.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.515
I'm going to speak
truth to power.

39:47.559 --> 39:49.430
And now that power
is finally listening,

39:49.474 --> 39:51.867
I am just getting started.Look.

39:51.911 --> 39:54.217
Bringing you to heel,
that's not why I'm here.

39:54.261 --> 39:56.263
I mean, candidly,
that's why I came,

39:56.306 --> 39:58.308
but on the way over...

39:58.352 --> 40:00.093
I got to thinking.
Thinking?

40:00.136 --> 40:03.357
That's a new trick
for folks in your building.

40:07.883 --> 40:09.276
How long have you
been here now?

40:09.319 --> 40:11.147
18 years.

40:11.191 --> 40:13.236
Well, I've been here six.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.977
Which makes me the new guy.

40:15.021 --> 40:17.023
And where I come from,

40:17.066 --> 40:20.113
you introduce yourself
to your neighbors.

40:20.156 --> 40:21.506
I'm Russell.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.467
Is that all, Russell?

40:26.511 --> 40:28.164
Look.

40:28.208 --> 40:29.992
I just wanted to say...

40:30.036 --> 40:32.473
democracy's messy.

40:32.517 --> 40:36.172
But rule one is every
voice should be heard.

40:36.216 --> 40:38.000
And yours has been
on the front lines

40:38.044 --> 40:39.698
for a very long time.

40:39.741 --> 40:43.005
And I wanted to thank you
for playing your part

40:43.049 --> 40:45.617
in this... this pageant

40:45.660 --> 40:48.184
we call the
American experiment.

40:48.228 --> 40:49.925
Because you matter.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.361
Truly.

40:54.843 --> 40:57.455
If there's ever anything
I can do for you...

41:00.066 --> 41:01.371
Thank you.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.897
Excuse me, I have to
finish this sign

41:04.940 --> 41:07.029
before the tour buses come.

41:20.303 --> 41:22.828
Been ages since
we've been on a proper date.

41:22.871 --> 41:25.091
Well, let's calendar one.

41:25.134 --> 41:29.095
In between international crises,
commissions, all-nighters.

41:29.138 --> 41:31.532
Oh, God, it turns me on
when you talk shop.

41:31.576 --> 41:33.316
[laughs]

41:34.404 --> 41:36.058
[sighs] I'm broke.

41:36.102 --> 41:37.190
[yelps]

41:37.233 --> 41:39.235
What?

41:39.279 --> 41:40.933
SpectroCoin went down to zero.

41:40.976 --> 41:42.630
There was a, uh,
massive sell-off

41:42.674 --> 41:45.067
as soon as
the Syrian crisis died down.

41:45.111 --> 41:47.113
Oh, well, gee,

41:47.156 --> 41:49.463
if I'd known I was
hurting your bottom line,

41:49.507 --> 41:50.856
I would have
reevaluated my position

41:50.899 --> 41:53.119
on preventing
World War Three.
Yeah.

41:53.162 --> 41:54.555
I'm done speculating.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.818
ELIZABETH: Hmm.HENRY: Allow me
to speculate.

41:56.862 --> 41:59.081
Someone still owes us $1,200,
and if he doesn't

41:59.125 --> 42:01.214
find a way to pay us back...I already have.

42:01.257 --> 42:04.304
I got a job as a busboy
at Frankie's, so...

42:04.347 --> 42:06.959
Steady income
and all the pizza I can eat.

42:07.002 --> 42:11.137
Good. We'll put you
on a payment plan.

42:11.180 --> 42:13.269
I trust you've learned
a valuable lesson

42:13.313 --> 42:16.272
about shortcuts, right?Yes.

42:16.316 --> 42:17.970
Always take the ones

42:18.013 --> 42:19.580
that don't depend on
your mom playing ball.

42:19.624 --> 42:21.756
Hey.I'm kidding.

42:21.800 --> 42:25.673
I'm rolling OG now,
so brick and mortar.

42:25.717 --> 42:27.893
All the way.Good.

42:27.936 --> 42:29.372
Then, uh, grab a sponge

42:29.416 --> 42:31.418
and come over here,
we'll train you up

42:31.461 --> 42:33.681
for your next gig, there, Snoop.Yeah.

42:35.335 --> 42:37.337
You know, there is
this one currency.

42:37.380 --> 42:39.600
It's called AnarCoin.
Kind of a sure bet.

42:39.644 --> 42:42.821
I mean, I could get us in
on the ground floor if you...

42:46.389 --> 42:48.217
Hey, where's the soap?
