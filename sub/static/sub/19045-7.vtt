00:00.300 --> 00:03.702
[ Dennis ]
I think most would agree.
[ Dee ] I don't agree.

00:03.704 --> 00:06.705
- Will you look at your skin?
- I am. What's the matter
with it?

00:06.707 --> 00:08.474
- It's all blotchy.
- How? I don't see it.

00:08.476 --> 00:11.744
Dad, will you look at
Sweet Dee's skin and tell me
it's not blotchy?

00:11.746 --> 00:13.879
- Do I have to listen to
this shit all morning?
- Come on.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.748
Frank, you've gotta be kidding
with these receipts.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.549
We were
actually doing better
before you took over.

00:17.551 --> 00:21.553
Hey! Hey! What's up, guys?
[ Sniffs ]
I didn't hear you guys come in.

00:21.555 --> 00:25.391
Uh, you know,
I was actually in here early
opening up this morning--

00:25.393 --> 00:26.759
Charlie, we had an agreement.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.794
This is a place of business,
not your home.

00:28.796 --> 00:32.464
- Uh, yeah, I know that.
- Not supposed to sleep
in the bar anymore, bro.

00:32.466 --> 00:35.267
- I wasn't.
- You didn't come home
last night.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.169
Oh, okay, okay.
Well, guess what.

00:37.171 --> 00:41.140
- I found some extensive water
damage in the back office.
- What?

00:41.142 --> 00:43.675
Yeah, so, maybe
I'm not such a bad guy...

00:43.677 --> 00:45.277
for passing out in there
and drinking too much
or whatever.

00:45.279 --> 00:49.448
-That's a terrible excuse, dude.
-Well, I drank too much,
so lay off.

00:49.450 --> 00:54.219
Holy shit! Guys, come here!
Come here! Check this out!

00:54.221 --> 00:55.654
Look!

00:56.322 --> 00:57.389
- What?
- What?

00:57.391 --> 00:59.491
That is the Virgin Mary.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.260
- What?
- Oh, take it easy, bro.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.129
No, look. The head
and the arms and the cape.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.464
- Does look like it.
- Weird.
- I don't see it.

01:05.466 --> 01:08.033
What if it's a sign?
You guys, remember,
I wanted to be a priest.

01:08.035 --> 01:13.505
- That's a water stain, dude.
- Or it could be a sign that
we need to get our pipes fixed.

01:13.507 --> 01:16.308
- What if it's a miracle?
- [ Chattering, Arguing ]

01:16.310 --> 01:20.846
Listen. It could be a miracle.
It could be bullshit.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.282
There's only one thing
we know for sure.

01:23.284 --> 01:27.853
- What's that?
- It's a goddamn gold mine.

02:01.688 --> 02:04.189
Well, I'll tell you, Jim.
I was in the back office,

02:04.191 --> 02:06.758
and I'd just finished praying
on my rosaries.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.662
And I was doing some crunches,
you know, working on my abs.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.931
And that's when I saw it.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.733
And I thought to myself,

02:14.735 --> 02:17.402
"That is definitely
the mother of our Lord."

02:17.404 --> 02:19.638
Did my face look fat?

02:19.739 --> 02:22.474
- Yeah.
- No, don't-don't
screw with me here.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.610
Seriously. It's just
the TV, right?
- No, it's been looking fat.

02:24.612 --> 02:30.482
So, if you like the Virgin Mary
and you like beer, come on down
to Paddy's Pub.

02:30.484 --> 02:35.621
- We got 'em both.
- Welcome to Paddy's Pub,
home of the Blessed Mother.

02:35.623 --> 02:39.324
Would you care to make
a donation?
- How much should I give?

02:39.326 --> 02:44.530
Well, what price can one put on
the viewing of a miracle?

02:44.532 --> 02:46.999
Give whatever you can.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.303
These people are pathetic.

02:51.305 --> 02:54.673
Yeah, Dad, I really don't
feel very good about what
we're doing in here.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.375
Well, don't get all
high-and-mighty on me.

02:56.377 --> 02:59.044
I only made four dollars,
Deandra. I think I can
live with myself.

02:59.046 --> 03:03.949
Let's move, lady. We got a long
line here. Don't be selfish.
All right. Rollin' on in.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.518
This is one of
the more ridiculous things
we have ever done, dude.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.988
I will tell you what is
ridiculous-- Taking advantage
of the mother of God.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.591
Are you kidding me?
That is a water stain, man.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.327
We are really pushing
our luck with the big guy
upstairs on this one.

03:15.329 --> 03:19.698
Dude, if you don't think
you're going to hell, you need
to take a long look at yourself.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.301
- Go look at yourself, bro.
- Okay, I'll do that.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.836
- Yeah, do it.
- Dee Reynolds?

03:24.838 --> 03:28.040
Oh, wow. It is you.
Matthew Mara.

03:28.042 --> 03:32.010
We were in physical therapy
together twice a week
after school.

03:32.012 --> 03:36.415
I was the only other person
in physical therapy with you.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.450
- Huh.
- I wore
the giant leg braces.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.320
- Oh, my God. Yeah,
with the leg braces.
- Yeah.

03:41.322 --> 03:46.058
- Wow. You look different.
- Yeah, so do you.
No more back brace, I see.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.460
You look wonderful. Yeah.
- Oh.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.895
- Matty Mara?
- Hello, Mac.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.898
I knew it! I called it from
across the bar, even without
the cripple braces.

03:52.900 --> 03:58.170
- So, what? You're a priest now?
- Wow! Look at you. Little
Matty Mara all grown up, huh?

03:58.172 --> 04:01.607
- Hey, Dennis, little
Matty Mara's here.
- Hey-oh!

04:01.609 --> 04:02.975
Hey, you come to witness
the miracle for yourself?

04:02.977 --> 04:07.012
Miracle's a strong word, Mac.
We don't just throw that around
like a football.

04:07.014 --> 04:11.049
- Well, you should.
- Well, I just came
out of curiosity.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.652
See what you had
at this bar of yours.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.722
- You have to admit
it's her, dude.
- Well, it's quite a likeness.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.524
- [ Mac ]
Yeah. You think it's a sign?
- No, it's a stain.

04:19.526 --> 04:22.494
But, uh,
it's an interesting stain.
I'll give you that.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.963
- Hey, Matty.
- Hello, Dennis.
How are you?

04:24.965 --> 04:26.031
I've been better.
I've been better.

04:26.033 --> 04:30.636
Let me ask you a question, man.
I know it's been years
since we've seen each other,

04:30.638 --> 04:32.638
but does my face look fat
to you?

04:32.640 --> 04:35.641
Well, we've all
put on a few pounds
since high school, so--

04:35.643 --> 04:39.578
Of course. Of course.
But I don't look fat
though, right?

04:39.580 --> 04:40.345
Um, no.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.748
- What did we call you
in high school?
- Rickety Cricket, dude!

04:42.750 --> 04:46.451
- That's right.
Rickety Crickety Legs.
- [ Creaking ]

04:46.453 --> 04:48.120
- Yeah, his legs were--
- [ Creaking ]

04:48.122 --> 04:51.590
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hey, remember how you would
pass out at parties,

04:51.592 --> 04:54.793
and Dennis would tea-bag you?
- Yeah, then I would
take the photo.

04:54.795 --> 04:59.865
We'd pass it around the school.
Everybody loved those photos,
Matty.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.968
- Hey, you still get
balls-to-the-chin cracks?
- No.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.803
Actually, that was
a long time ago.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.738
- It would be funnier
as a priest.
- Oh, my God. Those--

05:06.740 --> 05:09.574
Those were hilarious.
You don't understand how much
everybody loved those.

05:09.576 --> 05:12.077
- My balls on your chin.
- Everybody loved you, man.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.746
I think people
still have copies.
There's a lot floating around.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.916
- I saw them on the Internet!
- You were, like,
famous in school.

05:17.918 --> 05:21.620
Yeah, practically. I got a whole
shoe box of those things.
That's partially our doing.

05:21.622 --> 05:25.891
- Well, let's-- let's--
I should get going, so, um--
- Okay.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.559
Hey, hey.
Check it out though.

05:27.561 --> 05:33.198
Um, why did you pause
before you said "no" earlier?

05:33.200 --> 05:33.532
I'm sorry?

05:33.534 --> 05:38.837
Well, earlier when I asked you
if my face looked fat,
you kind of paused.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.105
I'm not sure.

05:40.107 --> 05:43.508
Uh, listen, Dee, it was
great seeing you again.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.411
- Oh, yeah. You too.
- Gentlemen.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.747
Cricket.
Later, Cricks.
See you, Rickety Crickety.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.549
[ Charlie ]
I love that guy.
How do you know the priest?

05:50.551 --> 05:54.519
- Went to high school with him.
- We should get him
to bless the stain.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.121
- Why?
- This could be huge, Charlie.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.623
I mean, endorsement from
the Catholic Church.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.626
No. No. See, you guys are
taking this thing way too far.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.962
You know what I'm gonna do?
Wash my hands of it.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.431
Washing my hands of
the whole situation, Lord.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.467
He will smite you all.
God will smite you all!

06:08.469 --> 06:12.504
Okay, uh, we should do it
soon though because the pipe
might leak a little more.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.941
The stain could fade.
You think this priest
would help you guys?

06:15.943 --> 06:18.043
I think Dee could
get him to do it.
Yeah.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.011
- What? Why me?
- Oh, "Why me?" she says.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.848
The guy was in love with her.
He would do anything for her.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.917
- No.
- All right. Remember the time
you said you'd kiss him...

06:25.919 --> 06:27.619
if he ate a horse turd?
- He ate the whole turd.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.956
The guy eats the whole thing.
Then she doesn't kiss
him 'cause--

06:30.958 --> 06:33.024
[ Together ]
His breath smelled like shit.

06:33.026 --> 06:36.027
That's my girl.
It didn't really happen
like that.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.096
No. He ate the whole turd,
and then she wouldn't kiss him.

06:38.098 --> 06:41.767
- Hey, come on. This would be
really good for the bar.
- No. Screw you guys. No way.

06:41.769 --> 06:46.905
- That's a bad attitude.
- The priest may not do it
because she's getting old.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.040
- Oh! Yeah.
- What is that?

06:49.042 --> 06:51.076
- Your skin's all blotchy.
- No, it's not.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.146
- He's not gonna do it.
You got the crow's-feet.
- Crow's-feet.

06:54.148 --> 06:56.848
- No, I don't.
- You're getting
the lines there.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.617
Mmm. Five head.
Laugh lines.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.720
You know what?
You guys are such assholes.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.689
I'm gonna see
what I can do.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.495
Take care. Bye.

07:10.497 --> 07:11.863
Matthew, hi.

07:11.865 --> 07:15.000
Dee. Wow.
What a nice surprise.
What brings you here?

07:15.002 --> 07:21.773
Well, the guys and I kind of
needed somebody to come and
bless that stain in our bar.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.477
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.646
Dee, I'm not gonna bless
a water stain.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.015
We don't do things like that.
The Catholic Church--

07:30.017 --> 07:31.483
Oh, no, no, no.
I know not them.

07:31.485 --> 07:34.719
I was hoping you could
do me a favor.

07:34.787 --> 07:38.156
I realize you were able
to get me to do things
for you in school, but--

07:38.158 --> 07:44.095
Oh, you know what? I did.
I kind of led you on a little
bit back then, didn't I?

07:44.097 --> 07:46.631
But I wasn't always
a tease, you know?

07:46.633 --> 07:50.535
Remember? I let you do
all my math homework.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.504
Not sure I follow
your logic.

07:52.506 --> 07:55.440
Well, what about that time
we almost kissed?

07:55.442 --> 07:57.576
You made me eat a--

07:57.578 --> 07:58.877
Look, I'm not blessing
the stain, okay?

07:58.879 --> 08:02.447
- Oh, no. Hold on a second.
- I mean, the taste of
that thing alone--

08:02.449 --> 08:04.216
- No, I can't imagine.
- It haunts me.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.685
Of course it does.
I'm sorry, okay? Forget--

08:06.687 --> 08:09.120
Forget I came by about
the stain. I don't care
about that anymore.

08:09.122 --> 08:13.825
I just-- I know you really
liked me back then, and I know
I wasn't very nice to you.

08:13.827 --> 08:19.464
And I think that's just because
I was too stupid to realize
how wonderful you are.

08:19.466 --> 08:19.831
I'm sorry.

08:19.833 --> 08:24.703
And for the record,
I think that you grew up
to be very handsome.

08:24.705 --> 08:28.473
You do realize you're
leading me on right now?
I'm a priest.

08:28.475 --> 08:31.676
Am I? Oh, I didn't even know.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.613
But if you wanted to grab
a drink sometime--

08:34.615 --> 08:36.982
- You're still doing it.
Oh, my God.
- I don't--

08:36.984 --> 08:40.886
Wow, I--
I think it's just 'cause
you look so handsome in--

08:40.888 --> 08:42.020
- Please leave.
- Okay, I'm gonna go now.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.155
- Thank you.
It would be best.
- All right.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.992
- God bless.
- Yeah.

08:48.127 --> 08:52.063
Would you care to make a
donation in the name of Paddy's
Pub to the Blessed Mother?

08:52.065 --> 08:55.166
- Mm-mmm.
- Charlie, this needs to stop.
If you guys don't do it,

08:55.168 --> 08:58.503
I'm gonna do it myself.
You're telling me.
I'm sick of doing this.

08:58.505 --> 09:01.973
- God is going to show
his wrath, Charlie.
- Excuse me.

09:01.975 --> 09:06.645
Are you the young man to whom
the Holy Mother first appear?

09:06.647 --> 09:09.881
Yeah.
Could you bless me,
please?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.817
- You want me to bless you?
- Please, senor.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.854
Uh, yeah, sure,
I guess.

09:15.856 --> 09:20.258
- In the name of the Father,
the Son, Holy Spirit. Amen.
- Right hand.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.695
- Gracias.
- You're welcome.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.331
- Did you see that, dude?
- [ Chuckles ]

09:26.333 --> 09:27.365
I just blessed that woman.

09:27.367 --> 09:31.202
I may have saved that poor,
wretched old person's life.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.405
Well, I don't know
about that, but, uh--

09:33.407 --> 09:34.539
This could be my
calling, Charlie.

09:34.541 --> 09:37.075
What happened to all that
God's wrath business,
and this has to end--

09:37.077 --> 09:41.646
Yeah, I know. Don't worry about
that, dude. I think this could
actually be a good thing.

09:41.648 --> 09:43.915
We could change the world.
Okay, okay.
All right.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.985
New plan, all right?
Let's go around,
let's bless people.

09:46.987 --> 09:51.222
Well, actually, I should bless
people though, but you could be
my right-hand man.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.392
You could be my Peter.
- Oh.

09:54.394 --> 09:54.993
Okay, I'll be your Peter.

09:54.995 --> 09:59.397
- Dress a little nicer though,
'cause you look like shit.
- [ Door Closes ]

09:59.399 --> 10:01.366
Hey. How'd it go
with the priest?

10:01.368 --> 10:03.969
Not gonna happen.
Did you put
the moves on him?

10:03.971 --> 10:07.272
First of all, gross.
I don't think you're supposed

20:13.213 --> 20:16.280
Mr. Reynolds, I'd like
to ask for your daughter's hand
in marriage.

20:16.282 --> 20:17.648
Done.
Okay, hold on
one second.

20:17.650 --> 20:22.486
Bless you.
Hold on. Did you just say
that you left the priesthood?

20:22.488 --> 20:23.788
Yes! Yes, I had to.

20:23.790 --> 20:27.058
- Matty, wow. You should
not have done that.
- What do you mean?

20:27.060 --> 20:31.529
You gotta-- You should go
and undo that right now.

20:31.531 --> 20:34.232
- Uh, but you said--
- Yeah, I know what I said.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.501
There were a lot of things,
and I meant all of them.
I did.

20:37.503 --> 20:41.372
But the thing is, I didn't
know you were actually
gonna leave the Church,

20:41.374 --> 20:47.478
which is why I felt safe
saying those things
in the first place.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.847
So wait. Wait. So--

20:50.882 --> 20:52.750
S-So you don't love me?

20:52.752 --> 20:58.155
Oh, Matty.
I think you are a great guy.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.491
Ooh.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.593
- My life is r--
My life is ruined.
- No.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.929
- It's-- Yes, it's ruined.
- No. It's not.

21:04.931 --> 21:08.733
What about this?
Why don't you go back
to the priesthood?

21:08.735 --> 21:11.168
I can't, okay?
I-I-- I can't.

21:11.170 --> 21:15.539
You can't just go back, Dee.
"Yeah, I wanna become
a priest again." You can't.

21:15.541 --> 21:19.010
Okay?
- But are you sure?
Did you double-check that?

21:19.012 --> 21:22.913
- Oh, my life is ruined.
- Hmm. So,

21:22.915 --> 21:26.684
I'm the bad person, huh?

21:27.252 --> 21:29.687
[ Groans ]

21:30.656 --> 21:33.591
- That's what you get
for not eating.
- Hey, Cricket!

21:33.593 --> 21:35.293
You know what would
make you feel better?

21:35.295 --> 21:40.298
- What could possibly
make me feel better?
- You wanna tea-bag Dennis?

21:45.771 --> 21:47.638
- I'll get the camera!
- Yeah!

21:47.640 --> 21:50.941
- Polaroid, Polaroid, Polaroid.
- Whoo!
