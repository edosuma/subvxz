01:40.033 --> 01:43.237
I'm disappointed, Joe.

01:45.306 --> 01:48.642
I-- I really wanted
to be wrong about you.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.079
But here we are

01:52.079 --> 01:54.282
in my office

01:54.282 --> 01:56.550
in the middle
of the night.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.754
I know you've been
lying to me

02:00.754 --> 02:03.324
since you got back
from Canon City,

02:03.324 --> 02:05.859
but I wanted to know
how far you'd go.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.595
Truth time.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.666
Tell me about the girl.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.747
New gift.

02:26.747 --> 02:30.684
"New gift needs to go
behind the curtain.

02:30.684 --> 02:34.522
This one wasn't
made in Kansas."

02:37.358 --> 02:39.760
- [door opens]
- [gasps]

02:55.976 --> 02:57.245
Frank, I'm sorry.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.955
Yeah, I'm
sorry, too.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.564
You've been crying?

03:16.564 --> 03:19.267
Yeah, for Laura
and the kids.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.855
After--

03:41.855 --> 03:43.391
After they were killed,

03:43.391 --> 03:45.158
I had this rage inside me.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.595
I felt like I was going
to lose my mind.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.564
And I-- I knew--

03:50.564 --> 03:53.100
I knew I had to do something,

03:53.100 --> 03:54.902
like you.

03:58.506 --> 04:01.542
So I made a gun,
a real gun,

04:01.542 --> 04:03.677
to shoot the Jap prince.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.913
I bought the bullets.
I was about to do it.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.148
I was just about to.

04:08.148 --> 04:11.051
And then I, uh...

04:11.051 --> 04:14.388
I saw this-- this--
this boy,

04:14.388 --> 04:16.757
this little--
this little Japanese boy.

04:19.327 --> 04:22.330
And when I-- I looked
into his eyes...

04:25.232 --> 04:27.468
[sigh]
I don't know. It was--

04:31.339 --> 04:33.374
It was like, uh...

04:35.576 --> 04:38.479
It was like--
like I saw myself.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.752
In-- In that moment,

04:44.752 --> 04:47.555
I-- I knew
killing that guy--

04:51.091 --> 04:52.493
it wasn't the answer.

05:24.257 --> 05:28.061
Joe: Her name is Juliana.
Juliana Crain.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.630
She had a film.

05:29.630 --> 05:33.000
She thought the SD agent
was her contact.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.469
He tried to kill her.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.838
She put up a fight.
He went off the bridge.

05:43.210 --> 05:46.980
I helped get rid of the body
to keep my cover intact,

05:46.980 --> 05:48.416
and that's it.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.950
That's all there is.

05:57.458 --> 06:01.128
Why did you keep it
from me, Joe?

06:01.128 --> 06:02.796
Do you have
feelings for her?

06:06.333 --> 06:07.635
Ah.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.072
About that, uh,
car crash.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.340
That was her, right?

06:13.340 --> 06:16.309
The body burnt
beyond recognition.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.045
- No.
- No?

06:19.447 --> 06:21.148
We wanted to look
like it was her.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.484
You wanted to protect her.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.921
She's just a girl.

06:27.921 --> 06:28.989
Get dressed.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.891
Get your things.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.799
Where are we going?

06:44.605 --> 06:47.107
[phone rings]

06:49.977 --> 06:52.946
[ring]

06:56.249 --> 06:58.986
[ring]

07:02.856 --> 07:04.091
Hello.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.859
Hey, honey, it's me.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.060
I'm sorry to call so early.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.062
Could you please
come over here

07:09.062 --> 07:10.097
and sit with your mom?

07:10.097 --> 07:12.500
She's been in a-- a mood

07:12.500 --> 07:14.802
the last few days.
She took a sleeping pill

07:14.802 --> 07:16.236
last night.
She's still asleep.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.771
Why? What is it?
What's wrong with her?

07:17.771 --> 07:18.906
I don't know.
Maybe it's what happened

07:18.906 --> 07:20.708
to Frank's sister
and the kids.

07:20.708 --> 07:21.775
I don't know.
Could you just come over here?

07:21.775 --> 07:23.176
I got to go in early.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.177
Thanks, Jules.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.190
Who was that?

07:37.190 --> 07:38.291
Arnold.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.292
Oh, God.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.695
What does he want?

07:41.695 --> 07:43.631
He said Mom's upset.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.535
He wants me to go
over there.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.070
Are you okay?

07:50.070 --> 07:52.840
Frank, he works
for the Japanese.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.775
Arnold works
at the Post Office.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.343
No, he works in
a surveillance room

07:56.343 --> 07:57.645
inside
the Nippon Building

07:57.645 --> 07:59.647
listening
to people's calls.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.815
I got in there last night,
and I saw him.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.220
- Did he see you?
- No.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.823
Are they making him do it?

08:11.291 --> 08:12.560
No. If anything,

08:12.560 --> 08:14.061
it looked like
he was in charge.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.363
Oh, my God.

08:16.363 --> 08:17.898
He's been lying
to all of us.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.000
If he's working for them,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.670
you have to be even
more careful, Jules.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.071
We both do.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.615
[phone rings]

08:39.620 --> 08:42.055
Mr. Childan,
this is Mrs. Kasoura.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.424
Well,
[speaking Japanese]

08:44.424 --> 08:46.994
I tried calling you back,
but you weren't at home.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.597
I am struggling

08:49.597 --> 08:51.231
to keep those pieces
I set aside for you

08:51.231 --> 08:52.399
from being snapped up.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.034
My husband wonders,

08:54.034 --> 08:55.869
would you like
to come for dinner

08:55.869 --> 08:57.304
at our house this evening?

08:58.606 --> 09:00.107
I'd be honored.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.610
And I could bring
the pieces with me then.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.711
Oh, no.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.145
My husband said
there's no need.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.315
This evening
is only dinner.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.917
What, as a--

09:09.917 --> 09:13.186
not for business,
just as a friend?

09:14.955 --> 09:16.657
Uh, who--

09:16.657 --> 09:18.491
who else
will be attending?

09:18.491 --> 09:20.193
No one else. Just you.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.462
Would 5:30 suit?

09:22.462 --> 09:25.866
We do not keep late hours.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.234
5:30.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.269
Just me?

09:29.269 --> 09:31.138
It's an honor.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.773
Thank you.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.281
Smith: The trouble
with humans, Joe,

09:41.281 --> 09:42.415
is that we're weak.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.852
A man sees a pretty face,
he wants her.

09:44.852 --> 09:46.754
It's natural. It's animal.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.956
We have to learn

09:48.956 --> 09:51.659
to override these
impulses, Joe.

09:52.559 --> 09:53.927
Juliana Crain

09:53.927 --> 09:56.830
is not a suitable
choice for romance.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.465
She's a traitor, Joe,

09:58.465 --> 09:59.867
an enemy of the state.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.969
And so are you if you
try to protect her.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.838
We should have put a bullet
in your brain already.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.675
He can prevent that.
Can't you, Joe?

10:07.675 --> 10:11.745
You can use
your budding romance

10:11.745 --> 10:14.014
in the services
of the Fatherland.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.449
Our sources
in San Francisco tell us

10:16.449 --> 10:18.218
a new film has been found.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.687
Find Juliana Crain.

10:19.687 --> 10:20.788
Find the film.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.389
If you succeed,

10:22.389 --> 10:24.057
I'll be prepared
to accept

10:24.057 --> 10:25.859
that you've learned
from your mistakes.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.261
If you fail, the girl
dies with you.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.262
Is that clear?

10:31.498 --> 10:33.667
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

10:39.039 --> 10:42.142
Call her.
That's her number.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.747
Be pleasant.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.849
Reminisce.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.151
Ask her how she
got the film.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.886
[ring]

11:27.287 --> 11:28.388
Hello.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.027
Just a second.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.663
It's for you.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.065
Who is it?

11:53.814 --> 11:54.882
Hello.

11:54.882 --> 11:58.418
Hey, Juliana. It's, uh,

11:58.418 --> 12:00.788
It's me. It's Joe.

12:01.688 --> 12:02.856
How did you get my number?

12:02.856 --> 12:05.325
I pulled in a favor.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.896
Uh, listen,
I can't talk right now.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.799
Let me call you back
tonight.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.266
Okay.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.436
Uh, how about you

12:16.436 --> 12:17.704
take my number?

12:17.704 --> 12:19.372
All right.

12:20.707 --> 12:21.809
Go ahead.

12:21.809 --> 12:27.047
Uh, JL5-0172.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.481
Okay, it might be late
in your time.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.516
Is that all right?

12:29.516 --> 12:31.351
That's fine.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.820
Bye.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.355
Bye.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.337
Was that him?

12:50.337 --> 12:51.638
Yeah.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.941
What did he want?

12:53.941 --> 12:55.708
I don't know.
He didn't say much.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.377
I told him I couldn't talk.

12:59.546 --> 13:03.050
Frank, you know nothing
happened between us, right?

13:05.552 --> 13:06.854
Okay.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.392
If you tell me that,
I believe you.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.498
All right,
I'll see you tonight.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.566
Okay.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.905
Put a wire tap
on his home phone.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.039
Yes, sir.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.274
Don't fuck it up,
Joe.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.150
[door opens]

13:38.418 --> 13:39.619
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.054
Jules.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.091
Thank you so much
for coming.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.394
You know, they got me
going in early.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.329
Crazy. The Post Office,
you know,

13:49.329 --> 13:50.763
they have us
working all hours.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.499
How come? Is there
something special going on?

13:53.566 --> 13:54.801
Juliana?

13:54.801 --> 13:56.469
Look who's up.
There she is.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.138
Honey, she's going
to sit with you
for a while.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.173
- I got to go to work.
- Okay.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.808
You girls
have a good time.

14:01.808 --> 14:02.943
- See you later, Jules. Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.078
Take care.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.549
I suppose he got you
over here, right?

14:09.549 --> 14:12.052
Said I was going crazy.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.786
No, he just said he was
worried about you.

14:13.786 --> 14:14.955
What's going on?

14:14.955 --> 14:16.156
I didn't want to tell you

14:16.156 --> 14:17.557
because I didn't
want you to worry.

14:17.557 --> 14:18.926
I got it into my head

14:18.926 --> 14:20.227
that we lost
your sister.

14:22.562 --> 14:26.166
I got the same feeling
I had when your father died.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.802
This tight knot in my gut.

14:29.802 --> 14:33.306
I mean, he was 5,000 miles
away in the South Pacific,

14:33.306 --> 14:36.243
but I felt it,
and I knew he was gone.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.446
And I was feeling that way
about your sister,

14:39.446 --> 14:42.382
but then I woke up
this morning...

14:42.382 --> 14:45.352
and it was gone,
just like that.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.488
I feel her again,

14:48.488 --> 14:51.758
just like nothing
ever happened.

14:51.758 --> 14:54.694
So everything's okay.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.396
Do you want some coffee?

15:20.720 --> 15:23.123
- Joe!
- Hey!

15:23.123 --> 15:24.824
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

15:24.824 --> 15:26.493
- Better now.
- Yeah?

15:27.594 --> 15:28.728
Everything okay?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.663
Ah, some kids
down the block

15:30.663 --> 15:33.033
were teasing him because
he doesn't have a dad.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.701
Well, you got me, right?

15:34.701 --> 15:37.070
How did you get on with
that homework that we did?

15:37.070 --> 15:38.805
I got a B+.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.007
You got a B+?

15:40.007 --> 15:41.508
That's better
than I ever did.

15:41.508 --> 15:45.445
How about-- I brought you
back a little something.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.181
The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.417
The man said
it's a good one.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.319
Read that in the kitchen,
Bud, all right?

15:52.319 --> 15:55.022
Joe and me need
a little time to talk.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.440
You didn't call.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.742
I thought something
had happened to you.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.044
Has something happened?

16:17.044 --> 16:18.545
No. Why?

16:21.281 --> 16:24.151
I'm expecting
an important call.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.585
It needs to be me
who answers it,

16:25.585 --> 16:27.287
and I need you and Buddy
to be quiet.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.360
So there's going to be
more driving, then?

16:33.360 --> 16:35.362
You're going to go again?

16:35.362 --> 16:36.629
No.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.732
Just the one job.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.668
Now I'm back.

16:49.076 --> 16:52.079
I hate sleeping alone
without you.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.147
I don't feel safe.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.510
I hate it
when you're away.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.771
Trudy.

18:03.183 --> 18:06.586
[Japanese chanting]

18:57.970 --> 19:02.209
Tagomi-san, I marvel at your
magic way with the flowers.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.911
If only I could
learn your secret.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.947
No secret.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.883
You plant them, they grow.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.820
Of course, you must
water them.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.488
Oh. [chuckle]

19:28.435 --> 19:31.604
Trade Minister,
Chief Inspector Kido is here.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.449
Ah. Chief Inspector Kido.

19:42.449 --> 19:45.084
Have you been
offered some tea?

19:45.084 --> 19:49.489
I've learned you have
in your employment
Juliana Crain.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.491
Yes. That's correct.

19:51.491 --> 19:54.261
She is the sister
to a known subversive.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.500
Thank you for the information.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.436
I will take it seriously.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.874
There is no doubt about it.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.577
I tell you to assist you,

20:10.577 --> 20:12.612
to save you
from embarrassment.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.281
Thank you, Chief Inspector.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.084
The responsibility
for the girl

20:18.084 --> 20:19.185
and all her actions

20:19.185 --> 20:20.720
lies with you.

20:33.733 --> 20:34.701
Miss Crain.

20:46.779 --> 20:47.880
Trade Minister.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.089
I apologize.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.392
I have caused you
embarrassment.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.764
I should have told you

21:04.764 --> 21:07.767
that the Kempeitai
had questioned me,

21:07.767 --> 21:09.536
and I will resign.

21:11.237 --> 21:12.905
Or you will dismiss me.

21:15.575 --> 21:20.880
No. In life there are
too many questions

21:20.880 --> 21:22.715
with a lack of time
to answer them.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.917
You may not
understand this.

21:24.917 --> 21:30.923
I live by
a 5,000-year-old book.

21:30.923 --> 21:35.227
I ask it questions
as if it were alive.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.830
It is alive.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.733
It tells me
you have a purpose.

21:40.733 --> 21:41.734
It says

21:41.734 --> 21:45.405
superior person
in an inferior position.

21:45.405 --> 21:48.708
Accepting a task
graciously

21:48.708 --> 21:51.678
brings good fortune
to all.

21:53.045 --> 21:56.716
We must all have faith
in something, Miss Crain.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.386
We cannot see ahead alone.

22:04.491 --> 22:09.396
When I was a young man
in Kyoto,

22:09.396 --> 22:14.200
we had beautiful garden,

22:14.200 --> 22:16.436
my wife and I.

22:19.406 --> 22:22.875
We-- We grew flowers.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.513
I'm sorry for your loss.

22:37.824 --> 22:38.858
Please.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.763
Send this to
the personnel department

22:43.763 --> 22:46.666
to add this room number
to your clearance.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.693
Trade Minister,
why do you disregard

23:13.693 --> 23:15.294
Chief Inspector Kido's
warning?

23:15.294 --> 23:17.263
What do you owe this woman

23:17.263 --> 23:19.098
that you would risk
so much for her?

23:20.700 --> 23:25.004
Find out about her sister.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.931
All right! Listen up!

23:51.931 --> 23:53.500
Want to shut that down, Bob?

23:53.500 --> 23:54.801
Hey!

23:56.636 --> 23:58.370
Everybody's going to be
sent home early.

23:58.370 --> 24:01.508
Yeah, but you're going to be
searched on the way out,

24:01.508 --> 24:03.209
so just form a line
right here.

24:03.209 --> 24:06.012
Then they're going to
shake down the factory.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.953
Frank, get out of here.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.657
[speaking Japanese]

24:45.384 --> 24:46.753
From the Trade Minister.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.176
Juliana.

25:12.211 --> 25:13.580
What are you doing here?

25:13.580 --> 25:15.314
Same as you.

25:15.314 --> 25:16.983
I work here.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.688
Meet me at the diner
on the corner

25:21.688 --> 25:22.989
after you've finished.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.997
[Japanese chatter]

25:46.145 --> 25:47.279
Hey, Frank.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.682
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:49.682 --> 25:51.317
Two salmon, please.

25:51.317 --> 25:52.484
Hey, you guys.

25:52.484 --> 25:53.820
You're early.

25:55.387 --> 26:00.192
Yeah. The, uh, Kempeitai
are turning over the factory.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.461
Um, listen.

26:02.461 --> 26:04.530
Go, uh, pick some stuff up.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.232
Just don't go far.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.734
Here you go.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.170
Why are they doing that?

26:11.170 --> 26:12.705
I'm not sure.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.509
How are you doing?

26:17.509 --> 26:20.412
Well, last night helped.
Thanks.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.413
But the truth is
I don't know.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.782
I understand.

26:25.652 --> 26:28.320
I have to say
I don't understand you.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.322
Yeah? Why is that?

26:32.458 --> 26:33.993
You have Jewish blood,

26:33.993 --> 26:36.963
just like me,
just like Laura,

26:36.963 --> 26:39.531
and you not only
decide to have kids,

26:39.531 --> 26:41.734
but you raise them Jewish?

26:41.734 --> 26:43.069
That's right.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.570
I know you get
how dangerous that is

26:44.570 --> 26:46.038
for you and for them.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.474
I'm not going to pretend
that it's easy.

26:48.474 --> 26:51.543
I struggled with it
for a while.

26:51.543 --> 26:53.412
But...

26:53.412 --> 26:54.914
this is who I am.

26:54.914 --> 26:57.316
This is
who my ancestors were.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.251
I'm not going to let them
take that away from me.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.087
And you think
it's worth dying for?

27:01.087 --> 27:02.689
I don't plan on dying,
Frank,

27:02.689 --> 27:04.390
but you can't live
your life in fear.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.693
I was back east
at the end of the war,

27:06.693 --> 27:07.827
in Boston.

27:09.696 --> 27:10.997
Oh, Jesus.

27:10.997 --> 27:13.900
You had to see it
to believe it, Frank.

27:13.900 --> 27:17.036
Overnight, lynch mobs
were murdering Jews

27:17.036 --> 27:19.538
because suddenly
we were less than human.

27:19.538 --> 27:21.007
And what did you do?

27:22.909 --> 27:26.879
Well, those of us
who came out in one piece.

27:26.879 --> 27:29.816
We buried service weapons
underground,

27:29.816 --> 27:32.719
well wrapped in oil,
and we vowed revenge.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.589
I got a life to lead,
got kids to raise.

27:37.589 --> 27:40.827
And Hitler and the Nazis--

27:40.827 --> 27:42.594
I mean, I don't care
how it looks.

27:42.594 --> 27:43.763
They won't last.

27:43.763 --> 27:46.198
One thing I realized
about my people

27:46.198 --> 27:47.734
is we got a different
sense of time.

27:47.734 --> 27:50.169
These may be dark years,

27:50.169 --> 27:52.872
but we'll survive.
We always do.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.742
You've just got to find
something to hold on to.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.846
- Faith, you mean.
- Yeah, faith.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.247
I don't have any of that.

28:02.548 --> 28:03.816
Well, what about art?

28:03.816 --> 28:05.017
You're supposed to be
an artist.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.285
Why are you making
fake guns?

28:06.285 --> 28:08.354
Because no one
wants to buy my art.

28:08.354 --> 28:09.822
So do it for yourself.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.858
Beauty is important, Frank.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.059
It gives us hope.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.094
I don't know.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.462
I don't know
where it would get me.

28:16.462 --> 28:17.864
Yeah. Right.

28:17.864 --> 28:19.431
You don't need anybody
to keep you down

28:19.431 --> 28:21.167
because you got
your own little inner
fascist right there

28:21.167 --> 28:23.035
telling you what you can
and cannot do.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.470
That's
how you let them win.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.308
If you change your mind,

28:29.308 --> 28:31.110
I can source that metal
for you.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.055
Time to get ready
for bed, Bud.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.295
Joe.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.900
You're not in
any trouble, are you?

28:53.900 --> 28:56.135
No. Of course not.

28:58.838 --> 29:01.240
I wouldn't do that
to you and Buddy.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.089
Arigato.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.432
[speaking Japanese]

29:32.905 --> 29:35.007
Robert Childan here
to see the Kasouras.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.175
[knock on door]

29:40.079 --> 29:43.449
Mrs. Kasoura, you look

29:43.449 --> 29:44.851
[speaking Japanese]

29:44.851 --> 29:47.319
I'm afraid I may be early.

29:47.319 --> 29:49.488
Not too early.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.023
Enter, Mr. Childan.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.527
I have brought
a gift to graft,

29:55.527 --> 29:57.864
to invite your most
favorable attitude.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.565
Most kind of you.

30:04.070 --> 30:06.906
Selected from the finest
objets d'art

30:06.906 --> 30:08.574
of America's dying culture.

30:09.675 --> 30:11.043
Uh,

30:11.043 --> 30:13.479
a flavor of our bygone days.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.984
Flappers used to wear
them in the 1920s.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.286
I saw you looking at them
in the store.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.554
It's decadent,
of course, but still--

30:22.554 --> 30:23.822
Thank you.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.425
Please, a drink?

30:26.425 --> 30:27.593
Whiskey?

30:27.593 --> 30:30.162
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Kasoura.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.367
Tasteful.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.604
Oh. Very tasteful.

30:38.604 --> 30:41.908
I sense the wabi here,
the harmony.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.644
Arigato, Kasoura-san.

30:45.644 --> 30:47.679
Please, call me Paul.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.948
And Betty.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.184
Then I am Robert.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.892
Mm. Is this
your collection?

30:59.892 --> 31:01.193
Would you like to see it?

31:01.193 --> 31:03.295
Oh, yes. Thank you.

31:04.396 --> 31:07.433
The pistol is
our prized possession.

31:11.170 --> 31:14.106
Colt .44 from 1860.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.108
Issued to the Union Army.

31:16.108 --> 31:20.446
Boys in blue brought it
into the second Bull Run.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.516
Please.

31:24.516 --> 31:25.952
Thank you.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.095
So tell me,

31:36.095 --> 31:38.064
how do you verify
what's real

31:38.064 --> 31:39.265
from any fakes?

31:39.265 --> 31:41.233
I have a practiced eye.

31:43.602 --> 31:46.772
What a wonderful sense
of history it exudes.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.707
Betty: Dinner is ready.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.242
Shall we?

31:59.818 --> 32:01.320
What the hell do you
think you're doing

32:01.320 --> 32:02.654
snooping around
the Nippon Building?

32:03.889 --> 32:05.657
Two coffees, please.

32:06.993 --> 32:08.460
I could say the same to you.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.895
What choice
do you think I had?

32:09.895 --> 32:11.363
I had a family
to support.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.199
How do you think
I kept all of you safe?

32:13.199 --> 32:16.635
I swallowed my pride,
and I did what I had to do.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.640
Did you have any idea

32:21.640 --> 32:24.543
that your sister was involved
with these insurgents?

32:24.543 --> 32:26.345
I heard her on the wire.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.247
So did all the other listeners.

32:28.247 --> 32:31.150
I had to throw myself
on the mercy of--

32:32.851 --> 32:34.720
our benevolent employers.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.689
I had to identify her.

32:37.689 --> 32:38.890
I told them she was a kid.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.659
I told them she was my kid.

32:40.659 --> 32:43.462
I mean, hell, I worked
for them for 16 years.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.064
It's got to be worth
something.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.432
16 years?

32:53.039 --> 32:54.573
Did you know she had a film?

32:58.577 --> 32:59.911
She did.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.380
And now there's another one.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.515
Juliana, you listen to me
very carefully.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.317
You cannot
get involved in this.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.719
There's something different
about this one, isn't there?

33:07.719 --> 33:09.221
I don't know what it is,

33:09.221 --> 33:11.190
but I can tell you they got us
working around the clock

33:11.190 --> 33:13.392
trying to find it.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.195
They screamed at me so loud,

33:16.195 --> 33:18.264
I thought they were
going to shoot us both.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.468
But everything I said
checked out,

33:22.468 --> 33:25.404
so they let her and that
idiot boyfriend of hers

33:25.404 --> 33:26.772
escape to the Neutral Zone.

33:28.274 --> 33:29.641
And thank God, Juliana,

33:29.641 --> 33:31.543
because if anything
happened to Trudy--

33:34.746 --> 33:36.215
I'd be finished.

33:49.195 --> 33:53.099
Mm. I mean,
this steak is delicious.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.168
We like to eat
American food.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.769
You cook it
to perfection, Betty.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.505
Thank you.

34:01.140 --> 34:04.110
Robert, do you like music?

34:04.110 --> 34:05.377
Hmm?

34:05.377 --> 34:08.114
Say, Bunk Johnson,
Kid Ory?

34:08.114 --> 34:09.248
Dixieland jazz.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.416
You know, Paul,
I'm afraid

34:10.416 --> 34:11.717
I'm not familiar
with Negro music.

34:11.717 --> 34:15.287
I prefer the classics:
Wagner, Beethoven,

34:15.287 --> 34:18.023
sometimes Bach.

34:18.023 --> 34:20.392
Perhaps if I played you
a selection

34:20.392 --> 34:22.328
from the New Orleans
Rhythm Kings.

34:22.328 --> 34:24.563
Paul,
he does not know it.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.665
Robert,

34:26.665 --> 34:30.169
yesterday I saw an American
say to his friend

34:30.169 --> 34:32.238
"Hey, you old bastard,"

34:32.238 --> 34:35.741
but bastard is an insult,
is it not?

34:35.741 --> 34:37.543
Ah, well, yes--

34:37.543 --> 34:40.011
And "old"
is also impolite.

34:40.011 --> 34:42.981
Sometimes insults
can show affection,

34:42.981 --> 34:45.717
and we address
strangers as friends

34:45.717 --> 34:47.219
- to show we're angry.
- Ah.

34:47.219 --> 34:49.655
For instance,
"pal" or "buddy."

34:49.655 --> 34:51.590
Hey, pal, back off.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.161
Yeah, it's confusing.

34:55.161 --> 34:56.862
It's stupid, really.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.330
Subtle.

35:07.373 --> 35:09.808
Robert, perhaps
you can help me

35:09.808 --> 35:11.076
with a book I'm reading.

35:11.076 --> 35:13.279
It's a novel from the 1930s

35:13.279 --> 35:15.614
by U.S. author
Nathaniel West.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.083
The novel
is Miss Lonelyhearts.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.685
I like it,

35:19.685 --> 35:24.523
but I can't seem to grasp
the author's meaning.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.992
I have not read that book,
I fear.

35:26.992 --> 35:28.727
Hmm.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.730
What a shame.

35:31.730 --> 35:35.934
The author has interesting
things to say on suffering,

35:35.934 --> 35:37.403
unlike Christians,

35:37.403 --> 35:39.805
who believe there must be
sin to account for it.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.407
Mr. West suggest

35:41.407 --> 35:43.842
that he might be
suffering with no cause,

35:43.842 --> 35:45.244
due to his being a Semite.

35:45.244 --> 35:48.780
Oh. Well, we all suffered
during the war,

35:48.780 --> 35:51.383
but if Japan and Germany
had not been victorious,

35:51.383 --> 35:53.252
then Semites would be
running the world today.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.759
Which, I'm sure, you would
agree would be most--

36:14.973 --> 36:16.675
[ring]

36:18.677 --> 36:20.312
[ring]

36:22.013 --> 36:23.515
[ring]

36:24.250 --> 36:25.484
Hello.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.653
Juliana: Hey, Joe.

36:28.954 --> 36:32.324
It's Juliana.
Is this a good time?

36:32.324 --> 36:34.092
Yeah.

36:34.092 --> 36:36.828
I couldn't talk from home.
The lines are tapped.

36:40.732 --> 36:43.635
Hey, Joe, I'm sorry I didn't
get a chance to say goodbye.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.938
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

36:46.938 --> 36:49.107
So how you been?

36:49.107 --> 36:52.678
Uh, yeah, okay.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.915
Did you hear anything
about this new film?

36:56.915 --> 36:58.684
What do you know about it?

36:58.684 --> 37:01.787
Nothing, really, just rumors
that there is one.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.291
Uh, yeah. Not much.

37:05.291 --> 37:06.825
Just, uh...

37:06.825 --> 37:09.528
just there's something
different about this one.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.330
What do you mean?
Different how?

37:17.703 --> 37:19.905
I don't know.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.373
Um...

37:22.341 --> 37:24.075
so, uh, how about you, Joe?

37:24.075 --> 37:25.344
What's your news?

37:25.344 --> 37:26.778
[beep beep]

37:26.778 --> 37:28.314
Operator:
Please insert more coins.

37:28.314 --> 37:30.316
Hey, Juliana, put some more
money on your phone,

37:30.316 --> 37:31.717
or just give me
your number there.

37:31.717 --> 37:34.920
[speaks Japanese]
Please insert more coins.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.332
[dial tone]

37:46.332 --> 37:47.333
Hello?

37:47.333 --> 37:48.600
Hello?

37:55.741 --> 37:57.343
Who is she?

37:58.977 --> 38:00.546
She's no one.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.013
It doesn't matter.

38:02.013 --> 38:03.482
I have to go out.

38:05.451 --> 38:08.019
[door opens, closes]

38:08.019 --> 38:11.557
We hope you enjoyed
your dinner, Mr. Childan.

38:11.557 --> 38:14.360
Mm. Yes, I did.
Thank you.

38:18.029 --> 38:19.531
Although, um--

38:20.666 --> 38:22.768
it's, uh,
it's still early.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.836
We like to learn,
you see.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.372
We're still new
to this country,

38:26.372 --> 38:28.440
so there's much
that is strange.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.241
Oh, I'm sure
there must be,

38:30.241 --> 38:31.843
although inferior,
of course,

38:31.843 --> 38:33.479
to the Japanese
way of life.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.246
- Yes.
- Well,

38:35.246 --> 38:36.948
next time you must
come to me.

38:36.948 --> 38:38.850
How about, um,
dinner next week?

38:38.850 --> 38:41.052
I can make rice
and miso soup.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.921
Next week we are busy,

38:42.921 --> 38:45.290
but thank you
for your time tonight.

38:45.290 --> 38:47.559
Well, uh...

38:47.559 --> 38:48.727
week after, then?

38:48.727 --> 38:51.963
It was instructive.
Thank you.

38:51.963 --> 38:52.898
Instructive?

38:57.235 --> 38:58.637
Of course.

39:00.038 --> 39:02.774
Well, I hope I've proved

39:02.774 --> 39:05.411
a useful research
opportunity.

39:06.578 --> 39:09.014
Arigato
for your hospitality.

39:15.086 --> 39:18.089
Did you hear anything
about this new film?

39:18.089 --> 39:20.225
Uh, yeah. Not much.

39:20.225 --> 39:21.960
Just, uh...

39:21.960 --> 39:24.029
just there's something
different about this one.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.697
- Different how?
- I don't know.

39:27.533 --> 39:29.568
So, uh, how--

39:31.036 --> 39:34.906
You think she knows
more about the film

39:34.906 --> 39:37.743
- than she's saying?
- Yes. Absolutely.

39:37.743 --> 39:39.445
Sorry. She just said
it was different, sir.

39:39.445 --> 39:41.447
Different to the others.

39:41.447 --> 39:42.948
What's your feeling, Joe?

39:42.948 --> 39:47.185
Do you think that she can
get to it on her own,

39:47.185 --> 39:49.688
using her contacts there?

39:51.122 --> 39:53.358
Maybe. I don't know.

39:53.358 --> 39:55.527
Perhaps you're going
to have to help her.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.830
You're going
on another trip, Joe,

39:58.830 --> 40:01.967
and you'd better hope
you find that film.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.772
You call in every day.

40:06.772 --> 40:08.373
Tell me everyone you meet,

40:08.373 --> 40:10.809
every little detail,

40:10.809 --> 40:12.277
everything.

40:12.277 --> 40:16.381
No omissions, no mistakes.

40:16.381 --> 40:19.718
I noticed yesterday

40:19.718 --> 40:22.554
you were very good
with my little girls.

40:26.525 --> 40:30.028
Is that because of...Buddy?

40:37.168 --> 40:38.303
[pat pat]

40:38.303 --> 40:39.905
Heil Hitler, hmm?

40:51.116 --> 40:52.050
What do you want?

40:56.187 --> 40:57.723
I got a proposition for you.

40:57.723 --> 40:59.691
How about I make you
guns to sell?

40:59.691 --> 41:01.326
We split the profits
50-50.

41:01.326 --> 41:02.761
Get out of here.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.395
Hey, don't make out
that you're above it.

41:04.395 --> 41:07.633
You sold me bullets.
What's wrong with guns
to fire them from?

41:07.633 --> 41:08.967
All right, look.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.369
I hollow out
the barrel of a fake,

41:11.369 --> 41:12.604
and then it's done.

41:12.604 --> 41:13.905
I'm not
an arms supplier, pal.

41:13.905 --> 41:16.575
I sell antiques,
authentic items only,

41:16.575 --> 41:18.209
and fake guns
aren't my thing.

41:24.550 --> 41:26.451
Tell me something,
Frink-san,

41:26.451 --> 41:27.719
how good a craftsman
are you?

41:27.719 --> 41:30.355
I mean, seriously,
how good?

41:30.355 --> 41:32.724
I'm good. Real good.

41:34.425 --> 41:35.961
Could you make this?

41:39.965 --> 41:42.000
Because I've got a chump
lined up to buy it.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.235
Japanese.

41:44.235 --> 41:46.137
Their brains are different.

41:46.137 --> 41:49.074
I'm sure they eat from
English bone china,

41:49.074 --> 41:50.642
and they listen
to Negro music,

41:50.642 --> 41:52.744
but it's all
just on the surface,

41:52.744 --> 41:55.781
ersatz as the day is long.

41:55.781 --> 41:59.284
Condescending bastards
look down on me.

41:59.284 --> 42:01.720
Here. Look at this.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.593
Two Zippo lighters.

42:07.593 --> 42:09.394
Yeah. Look the same,
don't they?

42:09.394 --> 42:10.996
Go ahead, hold them.

42:13.431 --> 42:15.634
One of them has
"historicity" in it.

42:15.634 --> 42:17.202
What the fuck is that?

42:17.202 --> 42:19.605
It's worth 100,000 yen
on a collector's market.

42:19.605 --> 42:20.872
Don't you feel it?

42:22.407 --> 42:23.441
100,000?

42:23.441 --> 42:24.743
One of those two
Zippo lighters

42:24.743 --> 42:26.277
was in Franklin
D. Roosevelt's pocket

42:26.277 --> 42:27.646
the day he was assassinated,

42:27.646 --> 42:29.047
so it's got historicity

42:29.047 --> 42:30.782
as much as any object
ever had.

42:30.782 --> 42:32.684
And the other one has nothing.

42:32.684 --> 42:33.919
That's your point?

42:33.919 --> 42:35.453
It's all a giant racket?

42:35.453 --> 42:37.889
And they're playing it
on themselves.

42:37.889 --> 42:40.759
I mean, a gun goes
through a famous battle,

42:40.759 --> 42:42.160
and it's just the same
as if it hadn't

42:42.160 --> 42:46.397
unless you know. It's all
in here, in the mind.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.634
So who's to say
our jeweled choker

42:48.634 --> 42:49.935
isn't Sitting Bull's
original?

42:52.537 --> 42:54.640
All right, so which one is it?

42:56.307 --> 42:57.275
This one.

43:03.548 --> 43:05.984
Won't he spot
that it's a fake?

43:05.984 --> 43:07.819
The man's already
got a forgery

43:07.819 --> 43:09.520
in his esteemed
collection:

43:09.520 --> 43:11.256
pistol aged
by an acid chemical,

43:11.256 --> 43:13.324
He can't distinguish
what's fake
from what's real.

43:13.324 --> 43:14.826
Let's screw him over.

43:14.826 --> 43:17.195
80,000 yen
split two ways.

43:17.195 --> 43:19.297
Just make sure
it looks good enough.

43:22.734 --> 43:25.671
60-40. I got
materials to cover.

43:40.886 --> 43:42.120
[door closes]

43:42.120 --> 43:43.321
[footsteps]

43:44.923 --> 43:46.858
- Jules?
- Yeah.

43:46.858 --> 43:48.259
Where have you been?

43:48.259 --> 43:49.594
I was with Arnold.

43:49.594 --> 43:50.829
He saw me at work,

43:50.829 --> 43:52.831
so I had to go
and talk to him.

43:52.831 --> 43:54.232
What did he say?

43:54.232 --> 43:56.702
He said...

43:56.702 --> 43:59.304
that he did it
to support us.

44:00.605 --> 44:03.975
And that he thinks
he saved Trudy.

44:04.876 --> 44:06.344
He thinks he's the one

44:06.344 --> 44:08.379
who got the Japanese to let
her go to the Neutral Zone.

44:08.379 --> 44:09.715
Did you tell him she's dead?

44:13.351 --> 44:14.720
No.

44:21.426 --> 44:22.393
What's wrong?

44:24.229 --> 44:25.997
Frank, I saw Trudy.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.398
- What?
- I was in the market,

44:27.398 --> 44:28.633
and I saw her.

44:28.633 --> 44:30.736
You saw the pawns
shoot her.

44:30.736 --> 44:33.338
I know it sounds crazy,
but I-- I saw her.

44:33.338 --> 44:35.774
Jules, we have to get
out of here.

44:35.774 --> 44:37.876
The Kempeitai came
to the factory today

44:37.876 --> 44:39.344
looking for the shooter.

44:40.746 --> 44:43.548
Do you think they were
looking for you?

44:43.548 --> 44:45.817
Ed told me they didn't
ask for anyone by name.

44:45.817 --> 44:47.285
I got out
before they saw me.

44:47.285 --> 44:49.020
Look, the Kempeitai
won't let this go

44:49.020 --> 44:50.421
until they've got someone,

44:50.421 --> 44:51.556
and now with Arnold,
Jules,

44:51.556 --> 44:53.224
I have to get out of here.

44:53.224 --> 44:54.993
And when they come
looking for me,

44:54.993 --> 44:56.828
you can't be here,
either.

44:58.764 --> 45:00.465
Okay, so what, we go
to the Neutral Zone?

45:00.465 --> 45:01.767
Yeah.

45:01.767 --> 45:03.334
You've got to trust me.

45:10.641 --> 45:11.810
But, Frank.

45:16.281 --> 45:19.885
What if she is still
around somehow?

45:36.134 --> 45:37.668
Frank: She isn't, Jules.

45:37.668 --> 45:39.237
She's gone.

45:42.373 --> 45:44.542
Trudy Walker.

45:44.542 --> 45:46.878
We don't know what she
was involved in?

45:46.878 --> 45:48.246
No, Trade Minister.

46:00.959 --> 46:03.895
Yesterday you knew
my wife was dead,

46:03.895 --> 46:05.931
even though
I told you nothing.

46:05.931 --> 46:09.835
Your compassion
has placed me
under your debt.

46:13.104 --> 46:16.241
You have a sister:
Trudy Walker.

46:16.241 --> 46:18.076
She--

46:19.978 --> 46:21.847
You know she's missing.

46:27.585 --> 46:29.520
It's not easy.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.489
I have to tell you.

46:31.489 --> 46:33.458
She's dead.

46:47.605 --> 46:49.107
And, uh...

46:50.876 --> 46:52.310
how do you know?

46:54.579 --> 46:59.885
I was given information
by Japanese authorities.

47:00.785 --> 47:02.153
I'm sorry.

47:02.153 --> 47:03.989
Did they tell you anything?

47:03.989 --> 47:05.356
Where she is?

47:08.393 --> 47:09.895
Her body.

47:13.131 --> 47:15.901
It's a horrible place
to see.

47:19.237 --> 47:21.106
I was taught
that in your culture,

47:21.106 --> 47:23.374
truth is of the highest
importance

47:23.374 --> 47:26.244
and only with the truth
can one move forward.

47:58.977 --> 48:02.948
When you find her,
ask her to forgive us.

48:02.948 --> 48:05.816
And bid her spirit
to cross the river

48:05.816 --> 48:07.518
to Anoyo
on the other side.

48:11.756 --> 48:14.359
[speaking Japanese]

48:43.521 --> 48:45.190
Thank you.

49:28.566 --> 49:30.468
[airplane zooms]

49:39.810 --> 49:41.046
Taxi.

49:42.613 --> 49:45.350
You wait!
Japanese go first!

50:11.209 --> 50:13.278
[birds squawking]

50:35.666 --> 50:40.271
[insects buzzing]

51:48.573 --> 51:51.242
[crying]
