Qbag.

00:36.154 --> 00:37.143
Q- bod.

00:37.222 --> 00:39.554
No, man.
Looks like dang ol' "Mogmo."

00:39.658 --> 00:41.819
I'm not even going
to give this animal

00:41.860 --> 00:44.385
the satisfaction
of trying to read it.

00:44.429 --> 00:45.760
That's just what he wants.

00:45.797 --> 00:47.856
One day you're living
in paradise.

00:47.900 --> 00:50.334
Next day,
it's a crime-ridden slum.

00:50.369 --> 00:53.395
Society's going
to hell in a hand basket.

00:53.438 --> 00:55.770
I blame the media-blamers.

00:55.807 --> 00:57.832
(car approaching)

00:57.876 --> 01:02.040
MAN:
And one more thing, people.

01:02.080 --> 01:05.480
K-107 is sponsoring
this year's science fair

01:05.516 --> 01:08.748
which now will be known
as "Rock the Science."

01:08.787 --> 01:10.755
The winner gets
to present their findings

01:10.789 --> 01:13.314
to Easy Ed
and the Chicken Boy.

01:13.358 --> 01:15.053
(bell rings)

01:15.093 --> 01:16.060
Dude, you want
to be my partner

01:16.094 --> 01:17.220
for the science fair?

01:17.262 --> 01:19.230
I found a dead bird
in my backyard

01:19.264 --> 01:21.232
we could probably
do something with.

01:21.266 --> 01:22.233
Thanks, Joseph

01:22.267 --> 01:24.428
but I'd like to increase
my chances of winning

01:24.469 --> 01:26.733
and decrease my
chances of working.

01:26.772 --> 01:29.366
Hey, Connie, want to be
my science partner?

01:29.408 --> 01:30.375
That'd be great!

01:30.409 --> 01:32.969
I've got about 50
awesome ideas.

01:33.011 --> 01:35.571
Well, 57 if we're allowed
to use radium.

01:35.614 --> 01:42.019
I'll e-mail them
to you tonight.

01:42.054 --> 01:44.079
Why are you trying to get
back together with her?

01:44.122 --> 01:45.817
What? I'm not.

01:45.857 --> 01:47.757
It’s just a science project.

01:47.793 --> 01:49.886
It's not like
we're in a play together.

01:49.928 --> 01:51.987
Dude, she might be
thinking something else.

01:52.030 --> 01:54.555
When she walked out of the room,
she looked back at you.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.589
I think you've been reading

01:55.634 --> 01:58.228
too many of your dad's
romance novels.

01:58.270 --> 02:01.364
Why else would
the smartest girl in class

02:01.406 --> 02:02.600
want to work with you?

02:02.641 --> 02:05.303
You made sun tea
for last year's
science project.

02:05.344 --> 02:11.305
Uh-oh.

02:16.622 --> 02:17.611
Damn vandal.

02:17.656 --> 02:19.283
This'll probably
take us hours

02:19.324 --> 02:21.588
between the joking around
and the horseplay.

02:21.627 --> 02:23.322
And the beer runs.

02:23.362 --> 02:25.023
Look, we're all upset

02:25.063 --> 02:27.156
but this guy hasn't
licked me yet.

02:27.199 --> 02:28.325
This is going
to be cool.

02:28.367 --> 02:31.928
Here we go.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.299
That was fast.

02:37.342 --> 02:38.707
You missed a spot.

02:38.744 --> 02:39.608
I did?

02:39.645 --> 02:40.873
No, man,
he didn't.

02:40.912 --> 02:43.380
Like a dang ol' shadow.

02:43.415 --> 02:45.406
I got to let her down easy.

02:45.450 --> 02:47.247
Normally, I'd start with a joke

02:47.285 --> 02:50.186
but that's how she fell for me
in the first place.

02:50.222 --> 02:52.190
You know what might
soften the blow?

02:52.224 --> 02:54.192
Tell her
I've always been into her.

02:54.226 --> 02:56.319
And that I always stare at her
not because I'm creepy

02:56.361 --> 02:57.555
but because I'm deep.

02:57.596 --> 03:02.693
I'll do what I can.

03:02.734 --> 03:05.760
Hey, partner.

03:05.804 --> 03:08.864
(grunts)

03:08.907 --> 03:10.898
(groaning)

03:10.942 --> 03:11.931
Connie?

03:11.977 --> 03:12.966
Whoa.

03:13.011 --> 03:17.175
I knew you weren't
wearing slutty lipstick.

03:17.215 --> 03:18.182
Huh?

03:18.216 --> 03:19.240
I just got flipped by this girl

03:19.284 --> 03:20.376
who looked kind of like you

03:20.419 --> 03:22.387
but she was dressed
like a teenager.

03:22.421 --> 03:25.652
Ugh! That's Tid Pao,
my cousin from L.A.

03:25.691 --> 03:27.386
She's sleeping in my room.

03:27.426 --> 03:28.586
L. A?

03:28.627 --> 03:30.788
She was so in my face,
I thought New York

03:30.829 --> 03:34.230
but L.A. Is even better.

03:34.266 --> 03:34.994
Hey

03:35.033 --> 03:36.466
ain't you the fat kid
who jumped me?

03:36.501 --> 03:37.832
Yes, yes, I am.

03:37.869 --> 03:38.995
Bobby Hill.

03:39.037 --> 03:46.068
So, Tid Pao,
how long you going to be here

03:46.111 --> 03:47.078
on the Third Coast?

03:47.112 --> 03:48.136
Till I ain't.

03:48.180 --> 03:50.148
She's here for the rest
of the semester.

03:50.182 --> 03:51.877
Not that anyone asked me.

03:51.917 --> 03:54.385
And while you're here,
stop attacking people.

03:54.419 --> 03:56.751
This isn't L.A.
Where "anything goes."

03:56.788 --> 03:58.949
Where it's cool
to take me to Knott's Berry Farm

03:58.990 --> 04:01.254
and totally ditch me.

04:01.293 --> 04:02.487
Whoa, sorry,
I didn't know

04:02.527 --> 04:04.654
I was smacking down
your boyfriend.

04:04.696 --> 04:06.220
Uh, boyfriend?

04:06.264 --> 04:07.231
Well...

04:07.265 --> 04:08.232
Well, he's... uh...

04:08.266 --> 04:09.927
I'm not!

04:09.968 --> 04:11.731
We’re just science partners.

04:11.770 --> 04:12.930
Nothing more.

04:12.971 --> 04:14.165
(scoffs):
Peace.

04:14.206 --> 04:15.195
Catch you later.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.800
"Catch you later's" still
a cool phrase, isn't it?

04:17.843 --> 04:19.708
I mean,
have you ever used it?

04:19.745 --> 04:20.712
No.

04:20.745 --> 04:22.145
Okay. Whew.

04:22.180 --> 04:24.580
Everybody,
we have a new student:

04:24.616 --> 04:25.844
Tid Pao.

04:25.884 --> 04:27.852
Now, I know
there are a number of ways

04:27.886 --> 04:28.784
we can make fun
of her name

04:28.820 --> 04:30.310
like "Kung Pao"

04:30.355 --> 04:34.587
or I suppose "Tid Poo,"
so let's have none of that.

04:34.626 --> 04:37.959
So, do you enjoy exploring
the mysterious world of science?

04:37.996 --> 04:38.963
Do you?

04:38.997 --> 04:39.964
Uh... yes.

04:39.998 --> 04:43.399
Did you see
how she turned it around on him?

04:43.435 --> 04:46.131
Okay, Tid Pao will
need a partner

04:46.171 --> 04:47.661
for the science fair.

04:47.706 --> 04:50.038
I assume Joseph is available.

04:50.075 --> 04:51.133
I don't want Tid Pao.

04:51.176 --> 04:52.404
I want Connie.

04:52.444 --> 04:53.502
You want Tid Pao.

04:53.545 --> 04:55.911
BOBBY:
That whole
family is hot.

04:55.947 --> 04:58.313
We could do something
with photosynthesis

04:58.350 --> 05:00.284
but that's not very sexy.

05:00.318 --> 05:02.684
And of course,
mitochondrial cell swapping

05:02.721 --> 05:04.689
has been done to death.

05:04.723 --> 05:07.453
Connie, I think we
should switch partners.

05:07.492 --> 05:08.459
What?!

05:08.493 --> 05:10.654
You asked me
to be your partner

05:10.695 --> 05:13.061
and now you're blowing me off?

05:13.098 --> 05:14.065
Great.

05:14.099 --> 05:15.066
Fine.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.067
You and Joseph have fun.

05:16.101 --> 05:18.069
So what's it going to be,
paper airplanes?

05:18.103 --> 05:19.331
How a rock works?

05:19.371 --> 05:21.236
Actually...

05:21.273 --> 05:23.002
I want to work with Tid Pao.

05:23.041 --> 05:26.010
But she's just
a stuck-up wise-ass

05:26.044 --> 05:28.478
who wears too much makeup.

05:28.513 --> 05:30.413
And the real reason

05:30.448 --> 05:33.417
her parents made her leave L.A.

05:33.451 --> 05:36.386
Is because her grades
are slipping.

05:36.421 --> 05:38.013
That's right, slipping.

05:38.056 --> 05:40.149
So, she's not book-smart.

05:40.192 --> 05:42.592
She gets an "A" in cool.

05:46.131 --> 05:47.826
Hi, science partner.

05:47.866 --> 05:50.733
You want to see my dead bird?

05:50.769 --> 05:51.963
Man, I hate it here.

05:52.003 --> 05:53.561
I just want to come home.

05:53.605 --> 05:55.402
GIRL:
Too soon, Q-Bag.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.600
Know what I'm saying?

05:56.641 --> 05:58.609
The Olvera Street Queens
still going off

05:58.643 --> 06:00.406
about that kilo you stole.

06:00.445 --> 06:02.310
Yo, just stay away, yo.

06:02.347 --> 06:06.215
Yeah, maybe I should give back
what I took from them.

06:06.251 --> 06:08.219
Where you going
to cop that much meth?

06:08.253 --> 06:10.221
You don't know any dealers
down there.

06:10.255 --> 06:12.587
I guess I'll have
to cook it up myself.

06:12.624 --> 06:14.592
I just got to get a hold
of the equipment.

06:14.626 --> 06:16.025
You better be careful, girl.

06:16.061 --> 06:19.861
People probably got their eye
on you.

06:19.898 --> 06:21.263
No sweat.

06:21.299 --> 06:23.267
I can con one
of these inbred hicks

06:23.301 --> 06:25.064
to do my dirty work for me.

06:25.103 --> 06:26.161
Hi.

06:26.204 --> 06:27.796
Hold on.

06:27.839 --> 06:30.330
Yo, Cleo, that hot dude
from next door is here.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.309
Call you back.

06:32.344 --> 06:35.336
Will you be my science fair
partner?

06:35.380 --> 06:38.406
Science partners, huh?

06:38.450 --> 06:40.350
Sounds cool.

06:40.385 --> 06:42.114
All right!

06:42.153 --> 06:44.485
I mean... 'Sup?

06:48.793 --> 06:52.251
BILL:
See? I was right.
It's Q-Bag.

06:52.297 --> 06:54.265
There's the "Q,"
and that's clearly "bag."

06:54.299 --> 06:55.960
Gentlemen

06:56.001 --> 06:58.834
I believe I've solved
our graffiti problem.

06:58.870 --> 07:01.930
We build a protective
razor-wire-topped fence

07:01.973 --> 07:05.170
around our existing fence.

07:05.210 --> 07:06.177
(sighs)

07:06.211 --> 07:07.178
Dang it, Dale...

07:07.212 --> 07:08.179
that's genius.

07:08.213 --> 07:09.180
Indeed.

07:09.214 --> 07:11.808
I will use a salami to simulate

07:11.850 --> 07:14.751
what this stuff will do
to a vandal's arm.

07:14.786 --> 07:15.753
Hmm.

07:15.787 --> 07:19.314
We need a real arm. Bill?

07:19.357 --> 07:23.259
BOBBY:
He, Tid Pao

07:23.295 --> 07:27.163
I've been, uh

07:27.198 --> 07:30.167
(clears throat)

07:30.201 --> 07:33.364
Jamming on some
science fair ideas.

07:33.405 --> 07:36.636
I've got some notions
involving goggles

07:36.675 --> 07:38.734
and some kind of beaker.

07:38.777 --> 07:39.766
Why don’t we
get together

07:39.811 --> 07:41.779
tonight for a brainstorming
session?

07:41.813 --> 07:42.939
See where it takes us.

07:42.981 --> 07:45.506
Don't worry about it.

07:45.550 --> 07:48.713
I already got an idea.

07:48.753 --> 07:49.720
Awesome.

07:49.754 --> 07:53.212
I'll pick you
up at 7:00.

07:53.258 --> 07:55.658
Luann, you're the
hippest person I know.

07:55.694 --> 07:59.130
I need to take
Tid Pao someplace
that's not boring.

07:59.164 --> 08:01.029
You know, sophisticated

08:01.066 --> 08:03.500
but close enough that
I can ride my bike.

08:03.535 --> 08:06.766
Okay. Um... you know
what's exciting?

08:06.805 --> 08:10.935
That place where you bet
on which chicken is madder.

08:10.976 --> 08:12.341
I could not help
overhearing

08:12.377 --> 08:15.471
and I cannot help
making some suggestions.

08:15.513 --> 08:16.480
Here's what to do.

08:16.514 --> 08:18.175
The Pioneer
Women's Museum.

08:18.216 --> 08:22.380
Mom, I'm looking for cool,
not lame.

08:22.420 --> 08:23.682
Lame? Well, maybe

08:23.722 --> 08:26.054
if you think it's "lame"
to spend an evening

08:26.091 --> 08:28.719
with costumes and artifacts
used by our foremothers.

08:28.760 --> 08:32.058
BOBBY:
I bet you thought
we were too hick

08:32.097 --> 08:33.325
to have sushi in Arlen.

08:33.365 --> 08:36.163
And a year ago,
you would have been right.

08:36.201 --> 08:37.759
MAN:
Salmon's almost
defrosted

08:37.802 --> 08:38.962
so it'll be just a sec.

08:39.004 --> 08:42.371
Your fries are ready, though.

08:42.407 --> 08:45.570
(coughing)

08:45.610 --> 08:47.601
Yo, man, this tuna's from a can.

08:47.645 --> 08:51.240
I got it, Carl.

08:51.282 --> 08:53.876
Maybe we should go
roller-skating.

08:53.918 --> 08:57.217
My mother clipped
a coupon for me.

08:57.255 --> 08:58.688
(scoffs)

08:58.723 --> 08:59.690
Um...

08:59.724 --> 09:01.692
BOBBY:
Oh, no!

09:01.726 --> 09:04.695
They're after us!

09:04.729 --> 09:06.196
(sighs)

09:06.231 --> 09:09.928
This is crap,
isn't it?

09:09.968 --> 09:11.435
The crappiest.

09:11.469 --> 09:12.436
Ooh

09:12.470 --> 09:15.906
I don’t think you're supposed

09:15.940 --> 09:18.909
to touch the women.

09:18.943 --> 09:21.138
Got boogs?!

09:21.179 --> 09:23.374
(laughs)

09:23.415 --> 09:24.882
(laughing)

09:24.916 --> 09:31.617
I think the cow wants
to milk Grandma.

09:31.656 --> 09:33.123
(laughing)

09:33.158 --> 09:37.117
You know what we should
do for our project?

09:37.162 --> 09:39.096
Find out how
boys like Bobby

09:39.130 --> 09:40.495
could possibly be interested

09:40.532 --> 09:42.966
in some street trash
like Tid Pao.

09:43.001 --> 09:47.597
You know, if you're tired,
you could crash here.

09:47.639 --> 09:50.870
Oh, Joseph, I
really don’t want

09:50.909 --> 09:53.343
to get into this again.

09:53.378 --> 09:54.345
Joseph!

09:54.379 --> 09:59.339
Joseph, don’t forget
to do the yawn and stretch.

09:59.384 --> 10:01.545
(awns)

10:01.586 --> 10:04.953
Uh.

10:05.490 --> 10:08.687
Hey, check this out.

10:08.726 --> 10:11.194
You're the one
doing that?

10:11.229 --> 10:12.787
My dad keeps having
to sandblast

10:12.831 --> 10:15.425
restain and lacquer it off.

10:15.467 --> 10:16.991
He's the one doing that?

10:17.035 --> 10:18.263
You've got to understand.

10:18.303 --> 10:19.895
He doesn't even approve

10:19.938 --> 10:21.303
of bumper stickers.

10:21.339 --> 10:28.472
Yeah, but you're cooler
than that, aren't you?

10:28.513 --> 10:32.005
Give me that can.

10:32.050 --> 10:33.017
Hmm.

10:33.051 --> 10:36.487
Check it out, girl.

10:36.521 --> 10:38.284
I'm representing!

10:38.323 --> 10:40.086
BILL:
QBag!

10:40.125 --> 10:41.854
Painterer!
You

10:41.893 --> 10:43.656
inside now.

10:43.695 --> 10:46.163
Dang it, Bobby.

10:46.197 --> 10:47.186
Your mother and I

10:47.232 --> 10:49.723
took our wedding photos
in front of that fence.

10:49.767 --> 10:52.497
Man, I'm just
keepin' it real, dawg.

10:52.537 --> 10:53.504
(chuckling)

10:53.538 --> 10:55.233
You'd never make it in L.A.

10:55.273 --> 10:58.003
I hope I never make it to L.A.

10:58.042 --> 10:59.031
I could make it in L.A.

10:59.077 --> 11:01.341
I just have very fair skin.

11:01.379 --> 11:03.472
My dermatologist says
it would be a death sentence.

11:03.515 --> 11:04.482
What's that?

11:04.516 --> 11:06.484
I'm sorry, Mom,
I-I couldn't hear you

11:06.518 --> 11:07.917
over the crickets and banjos.

11:07.952 --> 11:10.682
Mister, if you
think you're in
a small town now

11:10.722 --> 11:12.952
you're about to be
mayor of your room

11:12.991 --> 11:15.050
for a few months,
I tell you what.

11:15.093 --> 11:17.288
And stay away
from that Tid Pao.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.489
And don’t think
I can't tell the difference

11:19.531 --> 11:22.056
between her and Connie
because I can.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.465
I swear
to your father

11:23.501 --> 11:24.832
I keep you out of trouble

11:24.869 --> 11:26.837
and now you get mixed up
with Bobby Hill!

11:26.871 --> 11:29.101
What is it
with you beautiful Asian girls

11:29.140 --> 11:31.199
and that stupid redneck boy?!

11:31.242 --> 11:33.733
Why so self-destructive?

11:33.778 --> 11:34.904
Low self-esteem?

11:34.946 --> 11:37.414
Uh, long distance.

11:37.448 --> 11:38.938
You use
calling card?

11:38.983 --> 11:40.917
Of course not.

11:40.952 --> 11:42.749
Yeah, the stuff
will be ready by next week.

11:42.787 --> 11:45.415
I just got to sell it,
then book it back to Cali.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.321
I'll bring you a little extra
for your birthday.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.848
Aw...

11:48.893 --> 11:50.952
MAN (on radio):
Clear our calendars

11:50.995 --> 11:52.519
open-cockpit biplane fans.

11:52.564 --> 11:53.997
This weekend is the dedication

11:54.032 --> 11:56.023
of Arlen Airfield's
new wind sock.

11:56.067 --> 11:59.696
(sighing heavily)

12:11.616 --> 12:14.016
Yo, Tid Pao

12:14.052 --> 12:15.713
my dad said I couldn't see you

12:15.753 --> 12:18.244
and I just said, "Chill, Hank.

12:18.289 --> 12:20.689
You don't tell me what..."

12:20.725 --> 12:22.158
Close the door!

12:22.193 --> 12:25.560
Oh, crap! Did my dad see me?!

12:25.597 --> 12:28.157
Whoa. My dad said
that you’re a bad influence

12:28.199 --> 12:31.327
and here you got half
our science fair project done.

12:31.369 --> 12:32.336
What are we making?

12:32.370 --> 12:34.133
It's a... candy machine.

12:34.172 --> 12:35.139
All right!

12:35.173 --> 12:38.734
Hard candy, chewy candy,
sticky candy, gummy candy?

12:38.776 --> 12:39.743
Just candy.

12:39.777 --> 12:40.744
Interesting.
Interesting.

12:40.778 --> 12:44.236
So, what's the filling...
caramel, nougat, nuts, jelly?

12:44.282 --> 12:46.546
You ready to help me?

12:46.584 --> 12:47.551
Anything, partner.

12:47.585 --> 12:51.544
Yo, your dad works at
a propane place, right?

12:51.589 --> 12:53.557
Yeah, I'm going
to need, like, four tanks.

12:53.591 --> 12:55.286
Uh, I don't know.

12:55.326 --> 12:57.760
As soon as I ask him,
he'll want to know what it's for

12:57.795 --> 13:00.229
and when your name
comes up, no go.

13:00.265 --> 13:03.462
Then don't ask him.

13:03.501 --> 13:05.059
But...

13:05.103 --> 13:08.300
(sighing seductively)

13:08.339 --> 13:10.705
(moaning)

13:10.742 --> 13:13.939
(grunting and sighing)

13:13.978 --> 13:17.175
Sometimes I over-think.

13:17.215 --> 13:19.775
(Hank sighing)

13:19.817 --> 13:22.217
Can you believe the sass
coming out of his mouth?

13:22.253 --> 13:24.221
And now it's on my fence.

13:24.255 --> 13:25.347
Oh, come on, Hank.

13:25.390 --> 13:27.358
He's just trying
to impress a girl.

13:27.392 --> 13:29.383
Remember how when
we were first dating

13:29.427 --> 13:31.827
you used to run up
the down escalators?

13:31.863 --> 13:32.830
Yeah, well

13:32.864 --> 13:36.095
at least
he was using paint.

13:39.971 --> 13:42.201
This is your dad’s job?

13:42.240 --> 13:44.265
This place stinks.

13:44.309 --> 13:47.039
Uh, yeah, you
think that's bad?

13:47.078 --> 13:49.273
You should get a
whiff of his overalls.

13:49.314 --> 13:50.246
Most of his
customers

13:50.281 --> 13:52.146
pay him in manure.

13:52.183 --> 13:54.378
We're going to need
two more tanks.

13:54.419 --> 13:56.649
But these were
the only little ones outside.

13:56.688 --> 13:59.418
So, get some from inside.

13:59.457 --> 14:01.357
You've already jacked
his key chain.

14:01.392 --> 14:03.622
What's the biggie?

14:03.661 --> 14:07.597
Oh...

14:08.299 --> 14:10.130
(noise from behind door)

14:10.768 --> 14:12.133
(gasping and panting)

14:12.170 --> 14:16.334
Just going to grab
a soda, fellas.

14:45.436 --> 14:47.097
Morning, Joe Jack.

14:47.138 --> 14:48.867
Morning, Enrique.

14:48.906 --> 14:55.106
Morning, darlin'.

14:55.146 --> 14:57.205
Oh, my God!

14:57.248 --> 14:59.216
Mr. Strickland,
we've been robbed!

14:59.250 --> 15:04.688
No, no, it all got spent
on coffee yesterday. Honest.

15:04.722 --> 15:09.455
What the hell
is going on
in this town?

15:09.494 --> 15:12.429
First kids
are spray-painting fences.

15:12.463 --> 15:14.931
Now someone is stealing propane.

15:14.966 --> 15:18.458
I can understand wanting propane
so bad you could steal it

15:18.503 --> 15:20.767
but to actually
go through with it?

15:20.805 --> 15:22.067
What kind of sicko

15:22.106 --> 15:23.630
would do that?

15:23.674 --> 15:24.641
(sighing)

15:24.675 --> 15:26.643
Well, the propane
is under my watch

15:26.677 --> 15:28.008
so, it's coming
out of my pay.

15:28.045 --> 15:31.879
I was thinking maybe

15:31.916 --> 15:34.009
we can sell our first
batch of candy

15:34.051 --> 15:36.019
and use the money
to repay my dad.

15:36.053 --> 15:39.682
Also, I was thinking
we could call them Bobby Ruths.

15:39.724 --> 15:40.691
Forget that.

15:40.725 --> 15:44.786
I need you to jack us
some cough syrup, yo.

15:44.829 --> 15:47.354
You know, to finish our project.

15:47.398 --> 15:48.365
More stealing?

15:48.399 --> 15:51.334
Yeah, we got heavy into that
in the sixth grade.

15:51.369 --> 15:53.098
It's kind of played out.

15:53.137 --> 15:55.765
Now we're into asking
our parents for the money

15:55.807 --> 15:58.139
and explaining
what it's for.

15:58.176 --> 15:59.700
(sniffing)

15:59.744 --> 16:03.680
Yeah, that's what's cool now.

16:03.714 --> 16:06.080
Come on, Q-Bob.

16:06.117 --> 16:08.108
Uh, I got five bucks.

16:08.152 --> 16:10.518
We can go buy a bottle
of children's cherry.

16:10.555 --> 16:14.321
Man, you are so weak.

16:14.358 --> 16:20.422
I'll meet you here
before the science fair.

16:20.465 --> 16:24.367
I mean, the science fizz-air.

16:24.402 --> 16:25.733
Check out this machine we made.

16:25.770 --> 16:27.169
It picks up
radio signals.

16:27.205 --> 16:28.968
(exasperated sigh)

16:29.006 --> 16:30.064
It's an incubator,
Joseph.

16:30.107 --> 16:32.337
I had the radio on
in my room

16:32.376 --> 16:33.343
while I was making it.

16:33.377 --> 16:34.844
Then does music just?

16:34.879 --> 16:37.746
So, Bobby, where's
your cool girlfriend?

16:37.782 --> 16:42.344
She'll be here.
Don't you worry about that.

16:49.794 --> 16:50.920
Mom, the science

16:50.962 --> 16:51.951
fair's today.

16:51.996 --> 16:53.429
I need some cough syrup.

16:53.464 --> 16:55.056
Are you trying to play sick?

16:55.099 --> 16:56.999
Because I will have
a thermometer in you

16:57.034 --> 16:58.296
before you can sit down.

16:58.336 --> 17:01.271
No, no, I want to go to school
and win that science fair.

17:01.305 --> 17:02.636
And when I come home

17:02.673 --> 17:06.540
the only thing I'm
putting on Dad's fence
is a blue ribbon.

17:06.577 --> 17:07.907
Or a Chicken Boy T-shirt.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.641
I don't remember
what the prizes were.

17:10.681 --> 17:14.515
I'll be honest with you.

17:14.551 --> 17:15.540
I'm a little uncomfortable

17:15.586 --> 17:17.554
buying such a large
quantity of zoom

17:17.588 --> 17:19.146
from a 13-year-old girl.

17:19.190 --> 17:21.714
Please, mister,
could I just get the deposit?

17:21.759 --> 17:23.727
I'm late
for a Girl Scout meeting.

17:23.761 --> 17:26.457
Don't you cross me, little girl.

17:26.497 --> 17:28.192
Just made my deal.

17:28.232 --> 17:31.690
It'll be enough to pay back
the Olvera Street Queens

17:31.736 --> 17:34.637
and fly back to Cali
first class.

17:34.672 --> 17:37.106
Your punk ass picking me up
at the airport?

17:37.141 --> 17:38.540
Great, thanks.

17:38.576 --> 17:42.478
Oh, this is lemon!

17:53.791 --> 17:57.352
You brought it here?

17:57.395 --> 17:59.488
God, you are one dumb-ass
pig farmer.

17:59.530 --> 18:00.997
What are you yelling at me for?

18:01.032 --> 18:03.330
I'm the one here
rocking the science.

18:03.367 --> 18:04.629
Now, if you're ready

18:04.669 --> 18:05.795
to make some candy

18:05.836 --> 18:08.737
hand me that brake fluid.

18:12.176 --> 18:13.200
What's that cop

18:13.244 --> 18:14.268
doing here?

18:14.312 --> 18:15.142
Oh, that's
Mike Soto's dad.

18:15.179 --> 18:16.669
He's one of the judges.

18:16.714 --> 18:18.545
He was a substitute
science teacher

18:18.583 --> 18:21.381
last year while he was
on suspension from the force.

18:21.419 --> 18:24.354
Yo, I got two priors.

18:24.388 --> 18:28.688
But if you leave
you won't get any credit.

18:28.726 --> 18:30.523
It's all yours, man.

18:30.561 --> 18:32.927
Fine, more "A"s for me.

18:32.964 --> 18:36.764
Um, I think somebody
already did your project.

18:36.801 --> 18:39.634
Oh, yeah, it's
right over there.

18:39.670 --> 18:41.399
The vending
machine.

18:41.439 --> 18:43.669
That the best dig
you got?

18:43.708 --> 18:47.200
Maybe you need to invent
a trash-talking machine.

18:47.244 --> 18:49.906
(chortling)

18:55.987 --> 18:59.923
Doof! I hope this candy tastes
better than it smells.

18:59.957 --> 19:03.188
Oh, it's got to.
It smells like cat pee.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.887
Ammonia, cough syrup,
drain cleaner...

19:07.932 --> 19:10.492
Bobby, you're not making candy.

19:10.534 --> 19:13.503
Didn't you watch that MTV
special with Andy Dick?

19:13.537 --> 19:15.368
You're making...

19:15.406 --> 19:16.373
methamphetamine.

19:16.407 --> 19:21.868
You know...
crystal meth, ice, crank?

19:21.912 --> 19:25.245
Big deal,
I made a crank machine.

19:25.282 --> 19:28.649
I'll just change the sign
to "How a Crank Is Made."

19:28.686 --> 19:30.984
Now, quit blocking me
from the judges.

19:31.022 --> 19:34.423
It's drugs, Bobby...
the kind you go to jail for.

19:34.458 --> 19:36.392
Oh, God.

19:36.427 --> 19:37.951
I swear I didn't know.

19:37.995 --> 19:38.962
She set me up.

19:38.996 --> 19:40.964
I'm justa clod-hopping
pig farmer

19:40.998 --> 19:42.989
who was too dumb
to listen.

19:43.034 --> 19:45.059
You were so right
about her.

19:45.102 --> 19:46.069
Yup.

19:46.103 --> 19:47.570
Connie, please, think.

19:47.605 --> 19:50.665
You got to help me.

19:50.708 --> 19:55.008
Hey, you wanted excitement,
you got it.

19:55.046 --> 19:58.743
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

19:58.783 --> 20:01.980
The compression
generated by
the air pump

20:02.019 --> 20:04.749
can launch the potato
with enough force

20:04.789 --> 20:05.756
to go through

20:05.790 --> 20:07.587
a man's skull
at 100 yards.

20:07.625 --> 20:08.592
Candy?

20:08.626 --> 20:12.084
Bobby, this is a
refreshing change

20:12.129 --> 20:16.031
from Emily's "Can
mice swim?" project.

20:16.067 --> 20:18.365
Turns out they can,
but not for long.

20:18.402 --> 20:19.369
Let me try a piece.

20:19.403 --> 20:20.370
No, no, no. No.

20:20.404 --> 20:22.201
The experiment is a failure.

20:22.239 --> 20:23.638
I'll take the "F", sir.

20:23.674 --> 20:26.142
Ooh, it's like
rock candy.

20:26.177 --> 20:27.144
You know who has

20:27.178 --> 20:28.145
a sweet tooth?

20:28.179 --> 20:29.077
Officer Soto.

20:29.113 --> 20:30.341
Chad?

20:30.381 --> 20:33.282
No, you can't!

20:33.317 --> 20:34.750
It's bad! It's too sweet!

20:34.785 --> 20:35.877
You'll get diarrhea!

20:35.920 --> 20:39.048
I sneezed in it!

20:53.037 --> 20:56.495
W-what the heck
is wrong with you?!

20:56.540 --> 20:58.303
It was an accident.

20:58.342 --> 21:13.121
Prove it wasn't, yo.

21:13.157 --> 21:15.455
I'm the last
uncle you got.

21:15.493 --> 21:17.085
You screw up here

21:17.128 --> 21:21.224
we ship you back
to Grandma in Laos.

21:21.265 --> 21:24.894
(grunting)

21:26.937 --> 21:30.134
The yellow tail
smells a little funny

21:30.174 --> 21:32.142
but it all smells
kind of funny to me.

21:32.176 --> 21:34.474
Would you look at us...

21:34.645 --> 21:36.806
chillin' in
a hip new sushi place

21:37.114 --> 21:38.809
right here in Arlen.

21:39.116 --> 21:40.640
Who needs L. A?

21:42.720 --> 21:45.086
Hmm. So, this
is chicken tempura, huh?

21:46.490 --> 21:48.481
It's pretty good.

21:48.826 --> 21:51.488
Mmm, try it with the gravy,
Hank, it's... mmm.

21:53.497 --> 21:57.490
(drawl):
Domo arigato.
