- Hmm?

01:04.596 --> 01:06.463
A message from their majesties.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.866
King and Queen Lumpy Space!

01:08.935 --> 01:11.769
We can't find our baby girl!

01:11.838 --> 01:15.366
Oh! She's been missing for days!

01:16.676 --> 01:18.235
Whoa! Stop your crying, you two.

01:18.311 --> 01:19.643
We'll help you find
your daughter.

01:19.712 --> 01:21.772
We'll find her using
Jake's muscles.

01:21.848 --> 01:25.444
Dude, show off your muscles.
Whoo!

01:25.518 --> 01:28.044
No more tears, booblee bear.

01:28.121 --> 01:31.091
Please, take her these
sandwiches we made.

01:31.157 --> 01:33.388
She loves these sandwiches.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.691
Thank you, boys!

01:35.762 --> 01:37.287
Whoo!

01:37.363 --> 01:39.855
Dude, I know where Lumpy
Space Princess is.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.367
She's in the woods eating beans.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.434
Mm-hmm.

01:42.502 --> 01:44.733
This is gonna be easy as...

01:44.804 --> 01:45.703
uh...

01:45.772 --> 01:46.865
mm...

01:46.940 --> 01:48.408
Easy as childbirth.

01:48.475 --> 01:49.875
Yeah, okay.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.344
Oh!

01:52.412 --> 01:54.210
Aah! Oof!

01:54.280 --> 01:56.044
Please! Please, help me.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.880
A monster is terrorizing
our village

01:57.951 --> 01:59.886
and has eaten up all the crops!

01:59.953 --> 02:01.615
Why were you up
here in this tree?

02:01.688 --> 02:03.554
I thought I saw some food,

02:03.623 --> 02:05.182
and I was hiding
from the monster.

02:06.526 --> 02:08.324
You must help.

02:08.394 --> 02:10.829
Hmm. I guess we can help
this guy real quick

02:10.896 --> 02:12.593
and then get back to L.S.P.

02:12.665 --> 02:14.065
Where's your village?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.261
Um...

02:15.335 --> 02:16.496
I don't remember.

02:16.569 --> 02:17.730
Howard remembers.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.773
Hey! It's Howard!

02:19.839 --> 02:21.171
Howard!

02:21.241 --> 02:22.903
You remember where
the village is?!

02:22.976 --> 02:24.774
Yeah, I marked it on the map,

02:24.844 --> 02:26.403
but, uh... it's only half...

02:31.484 --> 02:33.544
Well, we're all ready.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.620
We can't leave yet.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.325
Awww.

02:42.395 --> 02:44.660
All right, now we're ready.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.427
What's in the basket?

02:46.499 --> 02:47.831
Samiches!

02:47.901 --> 02:49.267
Food!

02:49.335 --> 02:50.530
Food! Food!

02:50.603 --> 02:51.763
Wait! You can't eat this food!

02:51.804 --> 02:53.272
It's not ours to give!

02:55.408 --> 02:56.876
Now show us the
way to your town.

02:56.943 --> 02:59.174
Too tired from hunger.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.043
Carry me?

03:01.114 --> 03:02.776
Okay.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.013
The monster lives
in that windmill.

03:08.087 --> 03:10.488
We're too scared to go near it.

03:10.557 --> 03:11.557
Nothing scares us!

03:15.128 --> 03:16.255
Be alert.

03:16.329 --> 03:17.569
Anything could pop out of there

03:17.630 --> 03:19.223
and rip our faces off.

03:19.299 --> 03:20.460
Whoo!

03:24.771 --> 03:25.771
Be careful, Finn!

03:31.044 --> 03:32.342
It's you!

03:32.412 --> 03:34.108
Finn! What the junk?!

03:34.180 --> 03:36.376
It's you!

03:36.449 --> 03:38.247
Oh! Sandwiches!

03:38.318 --> 03:40.310
L.S.P., what the heck
are you doin' here?

03:40.386 --> 03:42.446
Are you in here making
out with the monster?

03:44.390 --> 03:45.790
No.

03:45.858 --> 03:47.793
I... am the monster.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.158
Whaaaaaaaaaat?!

03:49.229 --> 03:51.323
It's a long story.

03:51.397 --> 03:55.698
It all started at my
lumpin' parents' house.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.760
- Daughter.
- Yeah?

03:57.837 --> 03:59.635
How are the sandwiches?

03:59.706 --> 04:01.868
They're lumpin' delicious, mom!

04:01.941 --> 04:04.877
You know, you could enjoy
your mom's sandwiches

04:04.944 --> 04:08.244
every day if you came
back more often.

04:08.314 --> 04:11.716
No. You can have them delivered
to me at my apartment.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.583
We want you to move
back home, sweetheart.

04:14.654 --> 04:16.748
What?!

04:16.822 --> 04:19.418
You invited me here
under false pretenses?!

04:19.492 --> 04:21.723
Wait, sweetheart!

04:21.793 --> 04:24.025
We're just worried about you.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.225
Ha! Y'all don't think I
can make it on my own?!

04:26.299 --> 04:27.460
I'll show you!

04:27.533 --> 04:29.502
I'm running away!

04:29.569 --> 04:32.767
I stormed out and left
Lumpy Space forever.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.034
Oh.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.598
And then you found
this windmill.

04:35.675 --> 04:38.440
No. Something else
happened first.

04:38.511 --> 04:40.412
Keep listening.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.142
I was so cold,

04:42.215 --> 04:44.343
and I was so very hungry.

04:48.755 --> 04:51.122
Uh, uh!

04:56.062 --> 04:58.224
Oh, glob!

05:00.633 --> 05:02.625
Maybe I can...

05:02.702 --> 05:05.968
make a shelter out
of these nuts.

05:11.244 --> 05:14.874
It's not fair!

05:23.523 --> 05:27.085
I was rescued by a
family of wolves.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.493
The Mama Wolf was all like,

05:29.562 --> 05:33.897
"We must take care of her
as if she were our own."

05:33.966 --> 05:35.332
And Papa Wolf was all like,

05:35.401 --> 05:38.200
"This is a special child
who needs special love

05:38.271 --> 05:40.900
because she's going to be
great when she grows up."

05:40.973 --> 05:42.441
So these were talking wolves?

05:42.508 --> 05:44.443
No, they were normal wolves.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.172
I knew what they were thinking

05:46.245 --> 05:47.804
because of their body language.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.678
Stop interrupting, Finn!

05:50.717 --> 05:53.778
I found a home where I
could act like myself.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.916
They took care of me.

06:04.464 --> 06:07.593
I knew that if my parents
could see me now,

06:07.667 --> 06:11.661
they'd be jealous of how
lumpin' awesome I am.

06:11.738 --> 06:14.674
Oh, my glob!

06:16.109 --> 06:19.136
But then the drama started.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.116
Stephanie, Sue, can you
guys keep a secret?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.787
Okay, here's the secret.

06:32.859 --> 06:36.921
I just saw Jessica
making out with Mark...

06:36.996 --> 06:39.727
behind Tony's back.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.332
Stephanie, are you
even listening?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.770
'Cause I'm kind of
freaking out right now!

06:45.838 --> 06:47.397
Tony's gonna come
back from hunting

06:47.473 --> 06:48.873
any minute now and...

06:55.148 --> 06:57.117
Hi, Tony!

06:57.183 --> 06:59.778
Oh, my glob. Guys,
what are we gonna...

06:59.852 --> 07:01.013
Oh.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.289
So, should we say
something to Tony?

07:11.431 --> 07:14.424
You guys!

07:17.303 --> 07:21.934
Tony, Jessica's cheating on you!

07:22.008 --> 07:24.136
Oh, my glob! Oh, my glob!
Oh, my glob!

07:24.210 --> 07:26.236
Look, I'm sorry.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.304
I know it's none
of my business...

07:28.381 --> 07:29.381
I know!

07:32.618 --> 07:35.816
Because I think Tony has a
right to know, Stephanie!

07:37.590 --> 07:39.252
Nuh-unh, Miranda! I
do <i>not</i> like Tony!

07:42.061 --> 07:44.053
No, Jessica!

07:44.130 --> 07:45.928
Don't cheat on Tony with me!

07:47.033 --> 07:48.501
Aah! Aah!

07:48.568 --> 07:49.568
Uh! Aah! Aah! Aah!

07:53.005 --> 07:54.405
Oh, glob!

07:56.108 --> 07:58.100
Ah! Aah!

07:59.645 --> 08:01.978
Oh, glob!

08:02.048 --> 08:03.346
Oh, no!

08:03.416 --> 08:05.282
Ah! Aaaaaaaah!

08:05.351 --> 08:07.820
Aaaaaa! Aaaaaah!

08:08.921 --> 08:11.652
Oh, glob.

08:11.724 --> 08:15.752
I came upon a tribe
of villagers.

08:17.730 --> 08:20.029
Monster!

08:20.099 --> 08:23.126
Oh, I'm so hungry!

08:25.605 --> 08:27.130
Monster!

08:27.206 --> 08:30.734
Ah!

08:33.746 --> 08:35.442
Monster!

08:37.482 --> 08:40.043
Anyway, then I found
this windmill,

08:40.119 --> 08:41.985
and whenever I get hungry,

08:42.054 --> 08:43.682
I dress up like the monster,

08:43.756 --> 08:45.748
and I go eat all of
the villagers' crops.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.760
L.S.P., you're stealing!

08:47.827 --> 08:49.159
Don't say that!

08:49.228 --> 08:50.662
You're makin' me feel bad.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.498
Thanks, Finn.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.595
L.S.P., if you want
to feel better,

08:58.671 --> 09:01.038
you should apologize to the
farmers and make amends.

09:01.107 --> 09:04.407
- Really?
- Yeah. That'll work.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.412
Monster!

09:13.486 --> 09:15.216
Monster! Monster!

09:15.288 --> 09:16.847
Monster!

09:16.923 --> 09:18.391
No! No, wait!

09:18.457 --> 09:20.392
Monster! Monster!

09:20.459 --> 09:22.257
I'm not a monster!

09:22.328 --> 09:25.162
I was just pretending
to be a monster.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.756
Huh?

09:26.832 --> 09:28.391
And I'm sorry that
you're starving

09:28.467 --> 09:30.231
because I ate all of your crops,

09:30.303 --> 09:33.273
even though you're
all still really fat

09:33.339 --> 09:36.503
and I probably helped
you lose some weight.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.068
Did she just call us fat?

09:39.145 --> 09:40.422
Don't get all bent out of shape!

09:40.446 --> 09:41.812
I'm just being honest!

09:41.881 --> 09:43.076
L.S.P.!

09:43.149 --> 09:44.378
What?

09:44.450 --> 09:46.214
That apology was terrible!

09:46.285 --> 09:48.117
Look!

09:48.187 --> 09:50.918
The monster eats
while it apologizes!

09:50.990 --> 09:52.288
Let's kill it!

09:53.960 --> 09:55.519
Ohh!

10:03.636 --> 10:05.127
Please don't kill me!

10:05.204 --> 10:06.934
We have to!

10:07.006 --> 10:08.736
Well, you don't have to.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.902
Yeah. You can just let her go.

10:10.977 --> 10:13.537
If we let her go, she'll
keep eating our crops,

10:13.613 --> 10:15.206
and we'll starve!

10:15.281 --> 10:16.525
Why don't you just
get your parents

10:16.549 --> 10:18.074
to buy you more crops?

10:18.150 --> 10:20.984
We <i>are</i> parents!

10:21.053 --> 10:24.023
Those crops were
for our children!

10:24.090 --> 10:26.355
You guys are parents?

10:26.425 --> 10:28.553
Just like my parents...

10:34.166 --> 10:36.692
L.S.P., are you okay?

10:36.769 --> 10:38.465
Yeah, Finn. I'm great.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.005
Here.

10:40.072 --> 10:42.337
I want you to have
these sandwiches.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.377
Sandwiches?

10:44.443 --> 10:46.639
Yeah, they're really good.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.908
They're made with a lot of love.

10:54.253 --> 10:55.312
It's working!

10:55.388 --> 10:58.017
I saved the village!

10:59.158 --> 11:02.026
And that's how I
saved the village.

11:02.094 --> 11:04.893
Well, we're just
glad you're home.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.592
Whatever.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.635
And thank you, Finn and Jake.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.226
No problem.

11:10.302 --> 11:12.396
Yeah, we didn't
really do that much.
