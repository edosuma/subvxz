Hey, you think Obi-Wan
could have

00:03.151 --> 00:05.286
Beat Darth Vader
in the first Star Wars?

00:05.320 --> 00:07.504
That big battle they had
on the Death Star?

00:07.555 --> 00:09.122
I think that he could have
taken him out,

00:09.140 --> 00:11.842
But even if he takes out Vader,
he's still got, what,

00:11.893 --> 00:14.795
40 trillion stormtroopers
to contend with?

00:14.813 --> 00:17.398
I think he sacrificed himself
to let them escape.

00:17.432 --> 00:19.350
I would think
the stormtroopers just give up

00:19.401 --> 00:20.734
Once they see Vader's gone.

00:20.769 --> 00:22.336
I saw it as he's, like,

00:22.370 --> 00:24.939
He just--he knew he wasn't
gonna win, so he just gave up.

00:24.973 --> 00:26.123
- No way.
- No, that's not what it was.

00:26.174 --> 00:28.175
I think that he
was suffering from dementia,

00:28.193 --> 00:29.343
And he forgot
what he was doing.

Hello, and welcome back
to another episode

01:09.217 --> 01:10.651
Of Comic Book Men,

01:10.685 --> 01:11.852
One of the only two things

01:11.886 --> 01:14.388
That have ever made
apache chief cry.

01:14.422 --> 01:15.656
- Eh-neeek-chock!
- [laughs]

01:15.690 --> 01:16.857
I'm your host,
Kevin Smith.

01:16.891 --> 01:18.459
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:18.493 --> 01:20.494
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:20.528 --> 01:24.064
A really odd item came through
the doors the other day.

01:24.099 --> 01:26.467
Apparently,
it's pretty rare.

01:28.636 --> 01:29.803
- Hi, how are you?
- How you doing?

01:29.838 --> 01:30.938
Got a couple
of animation cels here

01:30.972 --> 01:32.139
I'd like you guys
to take a look at.

01:32.173 --> 01:33.840
- Let's check 'em out.
- There you go.

01:33.858 --> 01:37.478
Oh, yes.
He-Man, that's it.

01:45.020 --> 01:46.787
- So where'd you get this?
- I've been collecting

01:46.821 --> 01:49.523
Animation cels for years,
and this one actually

01:49.557 --> 01:50.991
Popped up in one
of my collections.

01:51.026 --> 01:52.893
And you're looking
for how much for the set?

01:52.927 --> 01:54.895
- 700.
- 700, huh?

01:54.929 --> 01:57.164
You know, these are cool pieces,
they are, but...

01:57.198 --> 01:59.800
It's hard for me to put a value
on it since I'm not that

01:59.834 --> 02:01.702
Knowledgeable
about animation cels.

02:01.736 --> 02:03.904
Would you mind if I called in
somebody who had a little...

02:03.938 --> 02:05.255
- Sure.
- Bit more knowledge than I do?

02:05.290 --> 02:06.807
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm gonna call Rob.

02:06.841 --> 02:09.326
Hold on.
Let me take care of this.

02:11.813 --> 02:13.647
Oh, you see what he's doing
is he's mimicking

02:13.681 --> 02:17.050
Aquaman calling
his army of fish.

02:17.068 --> 02:20.621
Mmhmm.
[laughter]

02:20.655 --> 02:23.907
One of them that he had
was an actual cel from the show,

02:23.942 --> 02:26.026
It was just a single,
solo shot

02:26.060 --> 02:28.195
Of Prince Adam,
He-Man himself.

02:28.229 --> 02:30.197
So if you're
gonna look for a

02:30.231 --> 02:32.116
He-Man piece of animation,
what do you want?

02:32.167 --> 02:34.184
You want He-Man,
at least, by himself.

02:34.219 --> 02:35.402
I thought so too.

02:35.437 --> 02:37.905
So you bring in
resident pop culturalist,

02:37.939 --> 02:39.273
Rob Bruce, of course.

02:39.307 --> 02:43.410
Wow, He-Man animation cels
signed by Lou Scheimer.

02:43.444 --> 02:44.845
This is really cool.
But He-Man,

02:44.879 --> 02:47.381
I think, ran 130 episodes.

02:47.415 --> 02:49.183
They produced more than
a million cels.

02:49.217 --> 02:53.320
So a cel like this,
nice full-figure, front view,

02:53.354 --> 02:58.325
- Probably run 175 retail.
- Okay.

02:58.359 --> 02:59.426
But this is really great.

02:59.461 --> 03:01.962
This is a setup sheet
that was used to

03:01.996 --> 03:05.966
Show you the different colors
for the character in any

03:06.000 --> 03:07.868
Scene he would be in through
the whole production.

03:07.902 --> 03:09.336
These are colors
that they would use.

03:09.370 --> 03:10.971
You couldn't vary from that.

03:11.005 --> 03:12.506
So how many of these
would they have made?

03:12.540 --> 03:13.974
This is actually
pretty hard to find.

03:14.008 --> 03:15.392
I would even consider it rare.

03:15.426 --> 03:18.912
This would have been
in-house only.

03:18.930 --> 03:21.748
- Less than probably six.
- Wow.

03:21.783 --> 03:23.600
But it's obviously
missing the overlay.

03:23.635 --> 03:25.052
Is that why everybody
looks so weird...

03:25.086 --> 03:26.186
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And ram man has crossed eyes?

03:26.220 --> 03:27.387
Right.

03:27.422 --> 03:28.889
I don't think it takes much
away from this,

03:28.923 --> 03:30.891
Because it's really unique.

03:30.925 --> 03:33.727
A piece like this,
I would think, you know,

03:33.761 --> 03:35.946
Conceivably 300 retail.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.797
So you're saying
for both of these,

03:37.816 --> 03:40.267
-You could e--a--retail 500?
-Yes.

03:40.301 --> 03:43.003
- You were looking to get 700.
- Right.

03:43.037 --> 03:45.339
I think the best
I could do today is 200

03:45.373 --> 03:47.474
For the set of two.

03:47.508 --> 03:48.742
Would you do 300?

03:48.776 --> 03:50.144
No.

03:50.178 --> 03:52.279
200 bucks, I'll take
them both off your hands.

03:52.313 --> 03:55.766
250?

03:55.800 --> 03:59.019
[groans]

03:59.037 --> 04:00.921
I think I'm gonna have
to stick with 200.

04:00.939 --> 04:03.390
I understand if, you know,
if that--if it's--

04:03.424 --> 04:04.925
- 200 is fair.
- 200 is fair?

04:04.959 --> 04:06.059
- All right, man.
- Thank you.

04:06.077 --> 04:09.613
- You got yourself a deal.
- Sounds good.

04:09.664 --> 04:12.666
[laughter]
- All right, well, good.

04:16.454 --> 04:18.772
No, don't worry about it.
We'll come out there.

04:18.805 --> 04:20.974
We'll take a look at it.
We'll figure something out.

04:21.007 --> 04:22.041
See you later.

04:22.076 --> 04:23.694
- Ooh.
- What's up?

04:23.728 --> 04:25.946
- That was Gary cor.
- What's up with Gary?

04:25.980 --> 04:28.799
He's had some health issues,
and lost his job,

04:28.850 --> 04:31.285
So he needs
to move his collection

04:31.319 --> 04:33.854
Because he has some
mounting medical bills,

04:33.888 --> 04:36.223
And he's fearful that he may
be losing his house.

04:36.257 --> 04:37.558
Who's Gary?

04:37.592 --> 04:39.893
Do you remember Gary ConOver?

04:39.911 --> 04:42.329
He's a regular, right?
At the store?

04:42.363 --> 04:44.965
Yeah, day one of the Stash,
he was there.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.900
He's been collecting
for--for years.

04:46.918 --> 04:48.969
I think since 1956,
he told me.

04:49.003 --> 04:50.020
Get out of here.

04:50.054 --> 04:51.205
- Yeah.
- Good Lord, man,

04:51.239 --> 04:53.607
That's gotta be
a big-money collection.

04:53.641 --> 04:56.843
When we first started out,
Gary kept these doors op

04:56.878 --> 04:59.146
He needs us,
and I want to help him out

04:59.180 --> 05:02.382
Because he's a good guy,
and he deserves it frankly.

05:02.417 --> 05:04.351
We'll go through the collection,
we'll evaluate it,

05:04.385 --> 05:05.602
And we'll take it
step-by-step.

05:05.637 --> 05:06.753
- I'm in.
- You're in?

05:06.771 --> 05:08.589
- I'm in.
- You know I'm in.

05:08.623 --> 05:10.624
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

05:14.495 --> 05:15.596
Wow, there's a lot
of great books

05:15.630 --> 05:18.465
Just in this small pile
right here.

05:18.499 --> 05:19.666
Waah.

05:19.701 --> 05:20.784
That's the mating call
of a comics nerd.

05:20.835 --> 05:22.219
[laughter]

05:22.253 --> 05:25.305
- Waah.
- Waah!

05:25.340 --> 05:27.608
Very early Fantastic Fours.

05:27.642 --> 05:29.476
A Thor annual number 1.

05:29.510 --> 05:31.478
- Remember that?
- That's awesome, yeah.

05:31.512 --> 05:33.180
- Tales of Asgard number 1.
- Wow.

05:33.214 --> 05:36.650
Look at that Kirby cover, man.
That is the iconic,

05:36.684 --> 05:38.919
Cosmic cover
right there, baby.

05:38.953 --> 05:41.455
- Iron Man number 1.
- Oh, my God.

05:41.489 --> 05:42.623
Daredevil number 1.

05:42.657 --> 05:45.909
First Silver Surfer.
First Galactus.

05:45.944 --> 05:47.995
Easily gonna get $100
in this shape.

05:48.029 --> 05:50.264
I mean, this is crazy.
It's, like, literally

05:50.298 --> 05:53.200
Like time capsule
after time capsule.

05:53.234 --> 05:55.319
Within the first
two or three boxes,

05:55.353 --> 05:56.837
We started finding gems.

05:56.871 --> 05:59.206
He's got Spider-Man
number 5, 4.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.774
Avengers number 4.

06:00.808 --> 06:02.109
First Cap in silver age.

06:02.143 --> 06:04.044
X-Men number 6.

06:04.078 --> 06:05.846
Superman, the first appearance
of the Legion.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.314
Good Lord.
So this guy's, like,

06:07.348 --> 06:09.416
Almost the king of
the silver age at this point.

06:11.052 --> 06:13.053
All this is a great sampling
of what you have.

06:13.087 --> 06:15.489
I'd love to take a look
at the rest of the collection.

06:15.523 --> 06:16.690
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.058
It's all up in the attic.

06:18.092 --> 06:20.861
- Lead the way.
- I will.

06:20.895 --> 06:22.996
Looking for Amazing Spider-Man
number 300.

06:23.014 --> 06:25.465
- First Venom.
- Fantastic.

06:30.882 --> 06:33.083
Oh, I haven't seen
you since the news hit

06:33.118 --> 06:34.918
About, you know,
Star Wars.

06:34.953 --> 06:36.186
There's been news?

06:36.221 --> 06:38.822
- Disney bought Lucasfilm.
- 4 bilions.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.974
Yeah, there's gonna be
three new Star Wars movies.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.342
Disney can use
their resources.

06:42.377 --> 06:44.461
They can hire whoever they want
to direct it,

06:44.496 --> 06:46.163
Hire whoever they want
to write it,

06:46.197 --> 06:47.898
And, you know, make sure
it's good this time.

06:47.932 --> 06:50.467
I think they should just
redo it, revisit it,

06:50.485 --> 06:52.336
And just redo Star Wars.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.687
Now you're getting
ridiculous.

06:53.738 --> 06:56.106
Why? Why?
The--the--the--why?

06:56.141 --> 06:57.441
What franchise
haven't they done?

06:57.475 --> 06:59.543
Well, who would you cast
in the new one?

06:59.577 --> 07:02.612
- As Luke?
- Yes.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.114
- Justin Bbieber.
- [laughs]

07:04.149 --> 07:05.482
Justin Bieber as Luke.
Yes.

07:05.517 --> 07:07.384
- Taylor Swift as Princess Leia.
- Absolutely not.

07:07.418 --> 07:08.435
No. No.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.287
Are they still brother
and sister?

07:10.321 --> 07:12.105
You know,
it's a new age, man.

07:12.157 --> 07:14.241
Now this time, maybe they
actually consummate,

07:14.275 --> 07:16.460
And then they find out.

07:16.494 --> 07:18.128
I think it should
be rated nc-17.

07:18.163 --> 07:19.329
[laughter]

07:19.364 --> 07:21.365
Suddenly, I'm not
so excited anymore.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.105
Hey, how's it going?

07:28.139 --> 07:29.406
- How you doing?
- Good.

07:29.440 --> 07:32.275
I'm looking for
Amazing Spider-Man number 300.

07:32.293 --> 07:33.410
First Venom.

07:33.444 --> 07:34.511
You're in luck.
We do have that.

07:34.546 --> 07:35.679
Excellent, excellent.

07:35.713 --> 07:37.214
Why are you looking
for that one today?

07:37.248 --> 07:39.482
It's a book I've been looking
for for a while.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.984
I love the character.

07:41.019 --> 07:43.270
Venom's just an incredible,
gnarly badass.

07:43.321 --> 07:45.255
Well, if you you're all into
tough and powerful men,

07:45.290 --> 07:47.124
Why don't you ask me
more about myself?

07:47.158 --> 07:49.326
[laughs]

07:49.360 --> 07:51.962
- As you requested.
- Fantastic.

07:59.037 --> 08:01.238
- So why Venom?
- When I was a young kid

08:01.272 --> 08:03.140
I was quieter and shyer
than I am now.

08:03.174 --> 08:04.308
When I started reading,
it was just like,

08:04.342 --> 08:05.542
"Wow, this guy doesn't care.

08:05.577 --> 08:07.411
This guy will kill,
maim, murder."

08:07.445 --> 08:09.413
Wasn't he, like,
he was a brain-eater?

08:09.447 --> 08:11.481
[laughs]
well, you forget one thing.

08:11.516 --> 08:13.617
He didn't go after
the innocent.

08:13.651 --> 08:15.202
But even if he's eating
bad guys' brains...

08:15.236 --> 08:16.320
I think--[laughs]

08:16.354 --> 08:17.821
He's still
chowing down on brains.

08:17.855 --> 08:19.356
Yeah, well, that's true.

08:19.390 --> 08:21.358
I think it was the other--
the misunderstood side of him.

08:21.392 --> 08:23.026
- Right.
- He wanted to do right,

08:23.061 --> 08:24.611
But, you know, he's tempted.

08:24.646 --> 08:26.029
- Like we all are.
- Yeah.

08:26.064 --> 08:27.831
I don't trust people
that are like,

08:27.865 --> 08:29.800
"My favorite character's
the supervillain."

08:29.834 --> 08:31.802
Venom began
as a total villain,

08:31.836 --> 08:33.303
And Marvel kind of
"heroed" him up...

08:33.337 --> 08:34.671
- Oh, yeah.
- In the last few years.

08:34.706 --> 08:36.472
But he proved so popular,

08:36.506 --> 08:38.174
They couldn't keep issues
on the stands

08:38.208 --> 08:41.010
He appeared in them.
Marvel was like,

08:41.044 --> 08:43.013
"We've got to turn this guy
into a hero,

08:43.047 --> 08:46.216
"because we can not market
a cannibalistic supervillain

08:46.251 --> 08:48.652
As a viable
mainstream character."

08:48.686 --> 08:50.621
It would be like kids
suddenly being like,

08:50.655 --> 08:53.040
"we like Jeffrey Dahmer."
[laughter]

08:53.091 --> 08:54.191
And people are like,"well,
we gotta find

08:54.225 --> 08:55.592
"a way to hero him up

08:55.627 --> 08:57.561
And get to get rid
of his shady past."

08:57.595 --> 08:59.763
Can we work with the price
on this one?

08:59.797 --> 09:02.599
I mean, I could do 95.
I mean, not much more.

09:02.634 --> 09:06.269
90?

09:06.287 --> 09:08.055
Okay.
I could do 90.

09:08.106 --> 09:09.273
- I could do 90, too
- All right.

09:09.307 --> 09:10.357
That's fine. I'm exci-

09:10.391 --> 09:11.475
This is--this is great.

09:11.509 --> 09:15.045
There you go.

09:15.079 --> 09:16.113
Awesome.

09:16.147 --> 09:18.148
Let's get to work.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.094
Wow.

09:31.129 --> 09:32.796
I have never seen
a collection like this

09:32.814 --> 09:35.332
In all the time
I've worked at the stash.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.601
This is pretty impressive.

09:37.635 --> 09:40.053
Gary tells us
there's only 25 boxes

09:40.088 --> 09:41.221
Of comics up in the attic,

09:41.255 --> 09:42.556
And how many did you wind up
bringing down?

09:42.590 --> 09:43.840
More like 72.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.993
He was collecting everything
from the big two.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.077
Everything.

09:47.111 --> 09:49.846
- How far back?
- The 1960s, '56.

09:49.881 --> 09:50.981
Good lord, man.

09:51.015 --> 09:53.250
It would take a lifetime
to read

09:55.153 --> 09:56.386
That is a massive collection,
man.

09:56.404 --> 09:57.788
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

09:57.822 --> 10:00.824
We need to come up with some way
he can get rid of it quick

10:00.858 --> 10:03.393
And he can get the most bang
for his buck though.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.462
Make sure they're out of
the house and light a match.

10:05.496 --> 10:07.998
[laughter]

10:08.032 --> 10:10.534
All right, a legitimate way
to get it in one shot.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.135
What about one of those
public auctions?

10:12.170 --> 10:14.304
They're gonna take
a huge chunk out of the profit.

10:14.339 --> 10:16.373
Yeah, you're right.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.141
All right, what if we hold
our own auction?

10:18.176 --> 10:19.910
We'll take no fees.

10:19.944 --> 10:21.945
- Gary gets the lion's share.
- Yeah.

10:21.979 --> 10:23.914
- I like it.
- Think about it.

10:23.948 --> 10:27.951
100% of the proceeds will go
to Gary and hidical bills.

10:27.985 --> 10:30.020
You know what that is?
That's Batman.

10:30.054 --> 10:31.087
That's a Batman move.

10:31.105 --> 10:32.539
That's what the Batman
would do

10:32.590 --> 10:34.558
And you guys are doing it
for Gary conover.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.026
That is genius.

10:36.060 --> 10:37.294
A little mini Comic-Con.

10:37.328 --> 10:39.796
Or a Gary ConOver-Con.

10:39.831 --> 10:43.934
We'll create a carnival
atmosphere with games, prizes.

10:43.968 --> 10:45.402
We can dress up in costumes.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.404
Cosplay?
From Walt Flanagan?

10:47.438 --> 10:49.456
It'll be a Comic-Palooza.

10:49.507 --> 10:50.957
- All right, let's do it.
- Let's do this, man.

10:51.008 --> 10:52.809
All right!

10:52.844 --> 10:54.177
I was just wondering
if you can give me

10:54.212 --> 10:56.480
Some information on it.
Who made it, when it made?

10:56.514 --> 10:59.149
- It says 1941 on that.
- Wow!

10:59.183 --> 11:01.818
Welcome to
the Gary ConOver Auction.

11:01.853 --> 11:04.688
[auctioneering]
Sold $685.

11:06.409 --> 11:07.876
Anybody who's been
reading comic books

11:07.910 --> 11:09.078
As long as we have

11:09.112 --> 11:11.380
Will remember
the hostess pie ads.

11:11.414 --> 11:13.032
- Oh, yes.
- Remember those?

11:13.083 --> 11:16.885
They had a one-page ad
that was paneled out like

11:16.920 --> 11:19.655
A real comic book page
featuring the biggest stars

11:19.689 --> 11:21.106
Of the D.C.
and the Marvel universe.

11:21.157 --> 11:23.792
You'd have the Hulk fighting
a bunch of his foes,

11:23.827 --> 11:26.178
And then they thought
they could stop the fight

11:26.212 --> 11:28.630
By throwing some pies
at the hulk.

11:28.665 --> 11:30.666
[chuckling]
- Yes.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.635
I was kind of a finity eater,
but those ads

11:33.670 --> 11:36.638
Made me beg my mom
to get me those pies

11:36.673 --> 11:38.007
For--like, I want them
in my lunch.

11:38.041 --> 11:40.342
I wanted a hostess pie to,
you know, to crack open,

11:40.376 --> 11:41.894
And all the--
all the kids would look around

11:41.928 --> 11:43.045
And be like,
"oh, he's got one of those..."

11:43.063 --> 11:44.546
- [laughs]
- "Comic book pies."

11:44.581 --> 11:47.349
[laughter]

11:47.384 --> 11:48.617
But sometimes you had heroes
that were like,

11:48.651 --> 11:50.185
"I'm low on my strength,"

11:50.203 --> 11:51.954
Getting a pie
and bringing them back,

11:51.988 --> 11:53.555
Sustaining them,
if you will.

11:53.590 --> 11:57.626
As if, like, you could
find super powers based on,

11:57.660 --> 11:59.828
Like, a pound of sugar
and whipped animal fat.

11:59.863 --> 12:02.297
[laughter]

12:09.945 --> 12:11.595
What are you doing?

12:11.613 --> 12:15.900
I am reading a movie site
to see what's coming up.

12:15.934 --> 12:17.735
Are you of those clowns
that's also, like,

12:17.769 --> 12:20.137
You've got to find out what
all the plot points are

12:20.155 --> 12:21.539
Before it comes out?

12:21.573 --> 12:23.040
I like to be informed.
What's wrong with that?

12:23.075 --> 12:25.876
The greatest moments of, like,
me going to the cinema...

12:25.910 --> 12:26.961
Right.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.078
Is not knowing anything
about the movie,

12:28.096 --> 12:29.647
And then just being
totally surprised.

12:29.681 --> 12:31.949
See, the greatest moments
in my life concerning cinema

12:31.983 --> 12:34.335
Are ruining moments like that
for people like you.

12:34.369 --> 12:35.586
[laughter]

12:35.620 --> 12:36.654
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey.

12:36.688 --> 12:39.840
Um, you guys
buy toys, right?

12:39.891 --> 12:41.375
Depends on what it is.

12:41.426 --> 12:42.526
This Star Trek toy?

12:42.561 --> 12:44.662
Ah, Captain Kirk.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.704
We don't really love

12:53.739 --> 12:54.872
Star Trek here.
Well, some of us don't.

12:54.890 --> 12:56.340
- I know you do.
- Yeah.

12:56.374 --> 12:58.175
If there is a Star Trek fan
in the shop, it is me.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.677
Oh, what's this on the side?

12:59.711 --> 13:01.262
- It's signed by Shatner.
- No.

13:01.296 --> 13:02.446
- This year at...
- Nice!

13:02.481 --> 13:04.381
A Comic-Con in Philly.

13:04.416 --> 13:06.050
Do you have a picture
of you getting it signed?

13:06.084 --> 13:07.318
I have a picture

13:07.352 --> 13:10.688
Of my dad in a Captain Kirk
outfit next to him.

13:10.722 --> 13:12.239
- That's weird.
- That is weird.

13:12.274 --> 13:14.458
- And that's coming from me.
- How often does your dad dress

13:14.493 --> 13:16.360
In a Captain Kirk outfit?

13:16.394 --> 13:17.762
Just, like, every Halloween.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.513
[laughter]

13:19.564 --> 13:21.382
But...

13:21.433 --> 13:23.834
- Well, this is very cool, man.
- Wrath of Khan.

13:23.868 --> 13:25.870
- Wrath of Khan.
- Possibly the best

13:25.904 --> 13:28.289
- Of the Star Trek movies.
- Which ain't saying much.

13:28.323 --> 13:30.374
What, it's got
to be "Wars" in "Stars"

13:30.408 --> 13:31.842
In order for it
to be interesting?

13:31.877 --> 13:33.010
Show me an alien.

13:33.044 --> 13:34.745
Show me a ray gun
for christ's sake.

13:34.763 --> 13:36.714
[laughter]
it's intolerable at times.

13:36.748 --> 13:38.849
They're just old guys
talking and talking

13:38.884 --> 13:40.718
And talking and talking.

13:40.752 --> 13:42.553
Think about the real military.
[laughter]

13:42.571 --> 13:44.688
They don't always have a war
or an adventure.

13:44.722 --> 13:47.024
Most of the time they're just
sitting around philosophizing,

13:47.058 --> 13:48.559
- Iting for something.
- Which is why the military

13:48.593 --> 13:50.861
Doesn't have a tv show.
[laughter]

13:50.896 --> 13:55.182
I would say to move on,
but the signature intrigues me.

13:55.217 --> 13:56.734
- Hmm.
- The signature

13:56.768 --> 13:59.136
Is the only saving grace
on this piece,

13:59.170 --> 14:03.674
Because it'd be cool to have
something signed by the captain.

14:03.708 --> 14:06.143
What are you looking
to get for it?

14:06.178 --> 14:08.929
I'm looking to get 150
for it.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.648
It's a little soft
on the corners.

14:10.682 --> 14:12.783
What about...
[drums fingers]

14:12.818 --> 14:13.918
120?

14:13.952 --> 14:16.186
Would you take 100?

14:16.204 --> 14:18.689
110.

14:18.707 --> 14:20.658
All right.
110.

14:20.692 --> 14:23.527
All right.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.529
"Live long and prosper."

14:25.564 --> 14:27.264
I thought
something interesting

14:27.282 --> 14:28.732
Came out of
the transaction though.

14:28.766 --> 14:33.020
- Ming does a mean Captain Kirk.
- Oh.

14:33.071 --> 14:34.972
Get out of here.
Ming, you got an impression?

14:35.006 --> 14:37.208
Mike, you have
crappy taste in sci-fi.

14:37.242 --> 14:39.510
[laughter]

14:39.544 --> 14:41.178
When you say
"a mean impression,"

14:41.212 --> 14:44.415
You meant a mean impression.
[laughs]

14:49.487 --> 14:50.821
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, how are you?

14:50.855 --> 14:51.922
I'm wondering if you
can help me with something.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.624
Let's see.

14:53.642 --> 14:56.326
Back in the 1970s,
my parents bought this for me.

14:56.344 --> 14:57.328
I was just wondering
if you can

14:57.362 --> 14:58.528
Give me
some information on it.

14:58.547 --> 15:00.030
Who made it?
When it was made?

15:00.065 --> 15:03.200
It's obviously a recreation
of Superman number 13.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.970
It says 1941 on that.

15:06.004 --> 15:07.021
I don't know.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.772
Maybe you better call in
your expert in.

15:08.807 --> 15:10.774
- Hey, rob.
- Yeah?

15:10.809 --> 15:11.959
Come on over here
for a second?

15:11.993 --> 15:13.961
Sure thing.

15:13.995 --> 15:15.412
It looked like
it may have been a poster

15:15.446 --> 15:18.449
That was produced in the 1940s
to promote Superman comics.

15:18.483 --> 15:21.585
Something that would be rare
as a faberge egg at this point.

15:21.620 --> 15:22.686
Yeah.

15:22.721 --> 15:24.421
Wow.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.823
That's sweet.
Great image.

15:26.841 --> 15:28.826
- Can you put a date on it?
- Yeah.

15:28.860 --> 15:31.528
I mean, you would think this
would be some sort of ad flyer,

15:31.546 --> 15:33.797
But they would never
have used this gloss.

15:33.832 --> 15:36.166
Now, there's a real giveaway
to this piece,

15:36.200 --> 15:39.336
Because it does say "1941,"

15:39.371 --> 15:41.705
But then it says
"Produced Massachusetts,"

15:41.739 --> 15:43.240
And it has a zip code.

15:43.275 --> 15:46.477
Now the zip code
was created in 1963.

15:46.511 --> 15:48.479
Ooh, man.
That's like a

15:48.513 --> 15:52.049
Sherlock Holmesian detail
that makes and breaks the case.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.233
I know,
and that validates why

15:53.268 --> 15:54.351
I call him in
all the time, right?

15:54.386 --> 15:55.536
Right then and there,
you're like,

15:55.587 --> 15:56.954
"this guy knows his stuff."

15:56.988 --> 15:58.706
Not only does he know the item,
he happens to know

15:58.757 --> 16:00.124
A little bit about
zip code history as well.

16:00.158 --> 16:02.126
[laughter]

16:02.160 --> 16:03.928
Do you see
a lot of these around?

16:03.962 --> 16:05.262
I do not see this item
that often.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.231
- That doesn't change the value.
- Right.

16:07.265 --> 16:10.200
I mean, it's more like
desirability pushes the market.

16:10.235 --> 16:11.502
At this point, you know,

16:11.536 --> 16:15.155
Instead of having this
as an original worth $5,000,

16:15.190 --> 16:18.776
It's a '70s piece
worth about $40.

16:20.345 --> 16:23.080
Would you take 20 for it?

16:23.114 --> 16:24.114
No.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.567
- 30?
- No.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.953
50 bucks.

16:28.987 --> 16:30.788
- No, I can't do 50.
- 50 bucks.

16:30.822 --> 16:31.922
- No.
- I'm gonna offer you more than

16:31.940 --> 16:33.290
What my expert
has said it's worth.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.491
I realize that.

16:34.525 --> 16:35.693
I'd like to hang it
in the Stash, man.

16:35.727 --> 16:36.910
How awesome
would it look back here

16:36.945 --> 16:38.946
On our wall right here, man?

16:38.997 --> 16:40.631
Boo-yah, right?

16:40.665 --> 16:42.933
How about 100.

16:42.967 --> 16:44.318
No.

16:44.352 --> 16:48.939
I'm not insane.
[laughter]

16:48.974 --> 16:50.140
Okay, guys.

16:50.174 --> 16:51.191
All right.
Thank you.

16:51.226 --> 16:52.309
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.712
- Thanks for coming in.
- Take care.

16:54.746 --> 16:56.146
190.
Can I have 200, can I have 200?

16:56.181 --> 16:57.448
- Sold for $205.
- You know you want it!

16:57.482 --> 16:58.749
- You know you want it!
- Sold for $300 right there.

16:58.783 --> 17:00.567
Yeah! Whoo!

17:12.573 --> 17:14.040
The day had come.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.424
Jay and Silent Bob's
Secret Stash

17:15.459 --> 17:16.742
Is proud to present

17:16.777 --> 17:19.212
- Gary (Con)Over Auction.
- [chuckles]

17:19.246 --> 17:20.913
That rolls right off
the tongue, doesn't it?

17:20.914 --> 17:22.348
[laughter]

17:22.382 --> 17:23.583
We were in Asbury Park--

17:23.617 --> 17:25.685
Asbury Park
is where we shot

17:25.719 --> 17:28.154
The "fake convention"
for Chasing Amy.

17:28.188 --> 17:31.224
Well, now it's time to come
full circle with a real Con.

17:31.258 --> 17:34.560
We had catalogued all his books.
We had put it all in order.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.529
We had put it--
separated it into lots.

17:36.547 --> 17:37.747
And at teginning
of the auction,

17:37.798 --> 17:39.565
We had a special announcement

17:39.600 --> 17:42.969

names in comic book history.

17:44.338 --> 17:46.038
Attention, true believers.

17:46.073 --> 17:49.242

Whoo!

18:44.114 --> 18:45.114
It's hot and heavy,

18:45.165 --> 18:46.933
And numbers
are flying everywhere.

18:46.967 --> 18:51.170
You know, "do I got 10,
do I hear 20, and 20, 50, 100!"

18:51.204 --> 18:53.239
Just when you feel like,
"well, I'm gonna sit down now,"

18:53.273 --> 18:55.057
You can't sit down,
'cause you're sitting down,

18:55.092 --> 18:56.058

18:56.093 --> 18:58.094

Thank you all for coming.

We appreciate it.
We thank you.

19:43.423 --> 19:46.125
Have a great night.
Have a safe drive home.

19:46.159 --> 19:47.326
Thank you once again.
Thank you.

19:47.361 --> 19:50.429
Whoo!
Good job, man.

19:50.464 --> 19:52.531
- Thanks a lot, man.
- No problem.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.733
[overlapping chatter]

19:53.767 --> 19:55.451

19:55.485 --> 19:58.404

19:58.438 --> 20:00.039
Sweet!
Wow, thank you guys.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.907
[applause]
I mean, thank you.

20:01.941 --> 20:03.209
I just--

20:03.243 --> 20:05.745
Thanks a lot, guys.
- Thank you.

20:05.779 --> 20:07.312
All right, you're welcome.

20:07.331 --> 20:10.950
This is the one thing
that has made him happy...

20:10.984 --> 20:12.084
And he really loves it,

20:12.119 --> 20:13.119
And he's had
a lot of fun tonight.

20:13.153 --> 20:14.987
I appreciate it.

20:15.022 --> 20:16.956
I'm not a crier.
I'm really not.

20:16.990 --> 20:18.174
- But thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

20:18.208 --> 20:19.358
You're welcome.

20:19.393 --> 20:21.794
It's so uncharacteristic

20:21.828 --> 20:24.647
Of any of you
to care about anybody,

20:24.698 --> 20:27.800
So this story
really warms my heart.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.368
In some way, and I don't
want to oversell it,

20:29.403 --> 20:32.171
But you guys
are heroic, man--

20:32.205 --> 20:34.106
Superheroic,
in this instance.

20:34.141 --> 20:37.760
You guys did something
completely out of character

20:37.811 --> 20:39.178
For your fellow man.

20:39.212 --> 20:41.113
I think it's important
that we ignore the doctors

20:41.148 --> 20:42.348
Who actually
did save Gary's life.

20:42.382 --> 20:45.885
[laughter]

20:45.919 --> 20:47.086
And that's gonna wrap it up

20:47.104 --> 20:49.021
For another episode
of Comic Book Men.

20:49.056 --> 20:50.256
I'm Kevin Smith.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.891
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:51.925 --> 20:53.409
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:53.410 --> 20:54.794
Remember, kids,
you're never alone

20:54.828 --> 20:56.595
At the Fortress of Solitude.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.798
Good night.
