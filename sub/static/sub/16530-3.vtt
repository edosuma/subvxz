00:06.307 --> 00:06.440
.

00:06.474 --> 00:07.375
- In the criminal
justice system,

00:08.008 --> 00:09.009
sexually-based offenses

00:09.043 --> 00:11.812
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.248
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.282 --> 00:16.150
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.184 --> 00:17.451
are members of an elite squad

00:17.485 --> 00:19.520
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.490
These are their stories.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.424
- Maybe we should set up

00:23.457 --> 00:25.359
a few more meetings
with the consultant.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.261
- We're fine
- Oh, I just found out

00:27.295 --> 00:29.130
that Matthew Sun
is on the board at Penn--

00:29.163 --> 00:31.299
- We're running late.
- Okay. All right.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.134
Oh, honey? Honey?
Just remember, okay?

00:33.167 --> 00:34.602
It's supposed to be
a conversation, you know?

00:34.635 --> 00:36.437
Just avoid yes or no answers.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.605
- Okay, Mom, I know.
- You look good.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.140
- I'll call you when
we get to Boston, okay?

00:39.173 --> 00:40.374
- Okay. All right.
Oh!

00:40.408 --> 00:43.577
Don't forget to mention your
three-week seminar in Nairobi.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.612
- Thank you.

00:49.317 --> 00:52.320
[phone buzzing]

00:54.722 --> 00:57.291
- Hey.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.193
Great.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.295
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.465

[both breathing heavily]

01:14.208 --> 01:16.277
*

01:16.310 --> 01:20.581
- Laura, are you sure
you want to have sex?

01:20.614 --> 01:21.715
- Absolutely.

01:21.749 --> 01:25.186
Why the hell do you think
we're here?

01:25.219 --> 01:27.255
[both moaning]

01:27.288 --> 01:31.659

[water faucet running]

01:34.695 --> 01:41.702
*

01:46.507 --> 01:48.276
- All right, thank you.
- Hi.

01:48.309 --> 01:51.212
- Hey, the victim's name
is Laura Collett.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.346
She's on her way
to the hospital.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.348
It looks like an overdose,
but no note.

01:54.382 --> 01:55.583
- Who found her?
- Maintenance.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.651
2:00 a.m.
Tub started overflowing,

01:57.685 --> 01:59.320
leaking water
into the room below.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.921
- Did she check in alone?
- Well, we're not sure.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.390
We're trying to pull video
at the moment,

02:02.423 --> 02:04.258
but, I mean,
the room is in her name.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.626
She charged it on her AMEX.

02:05.659 --> 02:09.397
- Key card?
- Last used at 9:56 p.m.

02:09.430 --> 02:12.233
- Any witnesses on the floor?
- No, nobody heard a peep.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.235
- Oh, looks romantic.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.703
Flowers, a bottle of Brunello.
- Yeah.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.605
CSU's gonna check that
for narcotics.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.273
- You said there was
an outcry witness, right?

02:19.307 --> 02:20.741
- Yeah, the suspect via text.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.643
- Okay, you got a name?
- No.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.378
I called the number
a few times.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.280
No answer, no voicemail.

02:26.314 --> 02:30.484
Laura's last text was
11:56 last night.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.652
*

02:31.685 --> 02:33.387
- "You raped me.
Burn in hell."

02:33.421 --> 02:36.190
Okay, clear and concise.
- Not exactly.

02:36.224 --> 02:39.760
She sent another text to the
same guy ten minutes earlier.

02:39.793 --> 02:43.264
- "Incredible night.
Just gonna say it.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.698
Best sex ever."

02:44.732 --> 02:47.668
So, in ten minutes
she goes from "best sex ever"

02:47.701 --> 02:49.270
to "you raped me?"

02:49.303 --> 02:51.239
How the hell
does that happen?

02:51.272 --> 02:54.275
*

02:56.310 --> 02:59.280
[dramatic music]

03:43.524 --> 03:43.657
.

03:43.691 --> 03:44.392
- Hey.
The vic's at the hospital.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.427
She's still unresponsive.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.696
Nearly lethal dose of
alcohol and diazepam.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.864
- Doctor says
it's looking 50/50.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.433
- Any other drugs
in her system?

03:52.466 --> 03:54.502
- No, and the doctor did
a full tox panel.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.903
No Rohypnol or other
date rape drugs.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.505
- Okay, so the victim has sex,

03:57.538 --> 03:59.039
and then has a change of heart
after the fact.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.542
- She goes from best sex ever
to rape in ten minutes.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.610
That's a pretty
big change of heart.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.811
- Ten minutes or ten hours.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.813
The question is,
what turns this into a rape?

04:05.846 --> 04:07.681
- TARU said these texts went
to a burner?

04:07.715 --> 04:09.016
- Yeah.
- All right.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.519
So the victim,
Laura Collett, married,

04:11.552 --> 04:12.853
lives in Manhattan.
What else do we know?

04:12.886 --> 04:14.788
- She's 42.
She has one son.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.457
- And here's a screen shot
of her phone.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.458
- Just another perfect family.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.460
- Wow, it's just too early
to be that jaded.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.794
- Next time
I'll wait till noon.

04:20.828 --> 04:21.829
- The husband,
he's at the hospital?

04:21.862 --> 04:23.897
- Yeah, unis called.
- Great, head down there.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.933
See what he knows.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.605
- Excuse me.
Mr. Collett?

04:31.639 --> 04:33.507
I'm Detective Carisi.
This is Detective Rollins.

04:33.541 --> 04:34.608
- We're looking
into what happened

04:34.642 --> 04:36.844
with your wife last night.

04:36.877 --> 04:40.013
- You're investigating her
for overdosing on pills?

04:40.047 --> 04:42.015
- No, no, we're not.
We're trying to understand

04:42.049 --> 04:44.051
what happened prior to that.

04:44.084 --> 04:47.020
- Prior?
- Yeah.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.822
You see,
your wife sent a text message

04:48.856 --> 04:52.760
from her phone
accusing somebody of rape.

04:52.793 --> 04:57.698
- So she was at a hotel
with a man who raped her?

04:57.731 --> 05:01.034
- Right now, we're just trying
to figure out who she was with.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.936
- When was the last time
you talked to Laura?

05:02.970 --> 05:04.071
- Late afternoon.

05:04.104 --> 05:08.709
I was--my son and I were
in Boston, visiting colleges.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.611
- Did you know that she was
staying at the Luxembourg Hotel

05:10.644 --> 05:12.613
that night?

05:12.646 --> 05:15.616
Mr. Collett, do you have
any idea who Laura was with?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.485
Maybe with somebody from work?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.853
- No.
She doesn't work.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.989
She's involved with
various charities, but...

05:22.022 --> 05:25.859
- Okay.
- We were happy.

05:25.893 --> 05:29.730
At least I thought we were.
- Had she taken up anything new?

05:29.763 --> 05:32.065
Tennis, hiking, or yoga?

05:32.099 --> 05:34.502
- More like college admissions.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.836
That's all she thinks about,

05:35.869 --> 05:37.905
where my son will be going
to college next year.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.508
- Right.

05:40.541 --> 05:44.044
Well, look, Mr. Collett, we know
this is all overwhelming,

05:44.077 --> 05:46.514
but we'd like your consent
to do a rape kit.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.517
[solemn music]

05:49.550 --> 05:50.618
*

05:50.651 --> 05:51.619
- What do you got?

05:51.652 --> 05:53.721
- The hotel just sent over
security footage.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.088
All right, at 6:14 p.m.,

05:55.122 --> 05:56.657
Laura walks in
the hotel lobby.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.127
She says hello
to this tall, white man.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.530
Looks early 40s.
He's decent looking.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.597
Well-dressed.

06:03.631 --> 06:04.598
- I'll run it through
facial-rec.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.066
- Great, so meanwhile,
head back to that hotel,

06:06.099 --> 06:09.570
show that image to guests,
doormen, front desk.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.772
See if anybody knows
who this guy is.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.741
- All right, take a ride
to the Luxembourg Hotel?

06:13.774 --> 06:16.043
- No, I can't.

06:16.076 --> 06:19.647
Barba set up an interview with
me with some ADA in Brooklyn.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.881
- Brooklyn?

06:20.914 --> 06:23.784
You got to grow a beard and
start making artisan pickles?

06:23.817 --> 06:25.052
- I'm just seeing
what's out there, all right?

06:25.085 --> 06:28.656
For the record,
I like artisan pickles.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.559
- Mm.
- How do I look?

06:31.592 --> 06:33.594
- Like a cop.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.198
- Hey, how did Noah do?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.868
Okay, did you talk
to his teacher?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.003
Oh.

06:43.036 --> 06:46.106
Okay, thanks, Lucy.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.208
- Everything good
with the little guy?

06:48.241 --> 06:51.044
- Apparently,
Noah's language skills

06:51.078 --> 06:52.946
are slightly underdeveloped

06:52.980 --> 06:54.682
relative to his peer group.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.950
You know,
I've just been doing my best,

06:56.984 --> 06:59.653
you know,
reading and talking, singing--

06:59.687 --> 07:01.855
- So he's not getting
into the fancy school?

07:01.889 --> 07:04.825
- They don't know yet.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.694
Anything new
with Laura Collett?

07:06.727 --> 07:07.795
- Rape kit came back.

07:07.828 --> 07:11.064
No semen, bruises, or abrasions,
but she did have sex.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.601
They found traces
of condom lubricant.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.703
- Any facial-rec?
- No, the guy's still a ghost.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.838
- Anything on social media?
- No pops on the perp,

07:17.871 --> 07:19.740
but check this out.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.676
She DM'd her son the day
before the incident.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.144
- "I'm sorry.
Call me."

07:24.177 --> 07:25.846
- And he writes back,
"You make me sick.

07:25.879 --> 07:26.880
I hope you die."

07:26.914 --> 07:28.682
- Huh.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.884
- Those are pretty strong words.
- Yeah, maybe the kid found out

07:30.918 --> 07:31.952
his mother was seeing
somebody else.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.887
I'll go back to the hospital,
see what he knows.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.924
- How'd your meeting go
with LaRosa?

07:38.892 --> 07:40.894
What, you think
I don't hear things?

07:43.697 --> 07:46.199
[footsteps approaching]

07:49.670 --> 07:53.106
- Hey, Justin.
How's your mom?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.976
- She's still unconscious, but
the doctor sounds optimistic.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.044
- Good.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.111
- Not sure if
he really means it,

07:58.145 --> 08:00.280
or he's just trying
to placate me.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.683
- Placate, huh?
Nice.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.017
SAT word, right?

08:04.051 --> 08:05.018
- [laughs softly]

08:05.052 --> 08:08.789
- So listen, we got this
from the hotel security.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.693
Do you recognize this guy
with your mom?

08:12.726 --> 08:14.161
- No, sorry.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.196
- That's okay.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.700
[sighs]

08:19.733 --> 08:22.770
So listen, Justin.
I, um...

08:22.803 --> 08:24.237
I saw the message
you sent your mother

08:24.271 --> 08:26.940
the night of the incident.

08:26.974 --> 08:30.177
What was she so sorry about?

08:30.210 --> 08:32.846
Why did you say
that you wanted her to die?

08:32.880 --> 08:35.015
- She kept bugging me
about Hudson.

08:35.048 --> 08:39.787
She really wants me to go there.
She thinks it's so prestigious.

08:39.820 --> 08:43.123
- You know, my mother...

08:43.156 --> 08:44.958
[chuckles]

08:44.992 --> 08:48.061
My mother didn't even know
I applied to college.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.296
No, seriously.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.998
Two days before
classes started, I said,

08:51.031 --> 08:52.900
"Hey, Ma, can I borrow
400 bucks for books?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.301
I just got into St. John's."

08:54.334 --> 08:56.069
- Lucky you.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.071
My mom's been on
four campus tours of Hudson,

08:58.105 --> 08:59.840
sat in on six lectures,

08:59.873 --> 09:01.208
and had three lunches
with some guy

09:01.241 --> 09:03.310
from the admissions office.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.713
The other day, she asked me
to have lunch with him.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.915
Said he might be
the difference maker,

09:07.948 --> 09:09.717
and I snapped.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.852
I'm sick of dealing with
all her stress over all this.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.286
I'm the one applying.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.288
[solemn music]

09:15.322 --> 09:19.092
I just hope that's not the
last thing I ever said to her.

09:19.126 --> 09:23.096
*

09:23.130 --> 09:25.833
- [sighs]

09:25.866 --> 09:27.234
Did she ever mention
the name of the guy

09:27.267 --> 09:31.038
at the--
the admissions office?

09:31.071 --> 09:34.808
- No, she never mentioned it.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.244
Do you think she...

09:37.277 --> 09:40.247
that because of our fight,
she took all those pills?

09:40.280 --> 09:44.017
- No.
No, put that out of your head.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.219
I think she loves you
very much,

09:46.253 --> 09:49.322
and it's because of that she's
gonna make a full recovery.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.992
*

09:52.025 --> 09:53.226
Come on.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.828
- You got to hit
that thing harder, man.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.263
- You know what's overrated?

09:56.296 --> 09:59.132
Wireless,
and putting lemon in water.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.267
I don't get that.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.501
All right.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.071
So Justin says that his mother
was spending time with some guy

10:04.104 --> 10:05.305
who works in the office
of admissions

10:05.338 --> 10:07.007
of Hudson University.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.044
I got 27 males
in that department, 19 women.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.046
- Takes all those people
to look at applications

10:13.080 --> 10:13.881
and say yes or no?

10:13.914 --> 10:15.916
- Hey, I just got back
from the hotel,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.350
and nobody recognizes
the unknown male,

10:17.384 --> 10:20.387
but I did get a name
that you might find interesting.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.156
Laura signed into
the spa at 6:33 p.m.,

10:23.190 --> 10:24.792
and a guy named Alden Kessler

10:24.825 --> 10:26.259
signed in at
the exact same time.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.896
- Hey, look at that.
He's at the top of my list.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.931
Director of Admissions.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.371
- Alden Kessler.
Where is he?

10:38.405 --> 10:39.873
Thanks.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.177
Hey, where's Alden Kessler?

10:44.211 --> 10:46.947
- You're looking at him.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.216
- Wait, you're Alden Kessler?
- Is there a problem?

10:49.249 --> 10:51.919
- Yeah.
A tall white one.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.987
Do you know him?
Or her?

10:54.021 --> 10:55.188
- No.
Never seen either one.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.290
Look, what's going on here?
- This is Detective Carisi.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.391
I'm Detective Rollins.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.060
We're from
the Special Victims Unit

11:00.093 --> 11:03.363
and we're investigating
a rape allegation.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.833
Is that your signature?

11:05.866 --> 11:09.069
- No, and I've never set foot
in the Luxembourg Hotel. Why?

11:09.102 --> 11:12.405
- There's a rapist out there
pretending to be you.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.408
[dramatic music]

11:21.882 --> 11:22.015
.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.116
- We think someone is using
your name, your identity.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.353
Any idea why somebody
would want to do that?

11:26.386 --> 11:29.056
- This woman, Laura, does she
have a child applying to Hudson?

11:29.089 --> 11:32.860
- Yeah, her son.
Justin Collett.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.995
[keys clacking]

11:36.196 --> 11:38.365
- [sighs]

11:38.398 --> 11:41.869
Yeah, there he is.
Senior at York Prep.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.872
3.9 GPA, 2250 SAT scores.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.073
- That's good, right?
- Exceptional.

11:46.106 --> 11:49.877
Problem is, we get 2,000 kids
with similar credentials.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.211
We only accept 400.

11:51.244 --> 11:54.014
The other spots
go to international students,

11:54.047 --> 11:55.182
athletes,
diversity candidates.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.885
- So, tough to be a rich,
white kid with great grades?

11:57.918 --> 11:59.186
That--that's what
you're saying?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.054
- At elite universities, anyway.

12:01.088 --> 12:04.157
- That must make you
a pretty popular man, right?

12:04.191 --> 12:06.126
When you're, like,
the--the doorman

12:06.159 --> 12:08.228
for the most exclusive club
in the world.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.529
- Do any of these rich parents

12:09.562 --> 12:12.933
ever try to, um...
influence your decision?

12:12.966 --> 12:15.803
- [scoffs]
No, never.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.838
That would be unethical.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.976
- Do any of them offer sex?
- Excuse me?

12:23.010 --> 12:26.413
- What I mean is, if you wanted
to exploit your power

12:26.446 --> 12:28.982
in a sexual way,
would there be any takers?

12:29.016 --> 12:31.184
- I've been offered all kinds
of outrageous things,

12:31.218 --> 12:34.988
a part ownership at a winery
in Bordeaux, a Monet.

12:35.022 --> 12:38.191
Last year, a hedge funder
with an underachieving son

12:38.225 --> 12:39.326
offered me $5 million,

12:39.359 --> 12:43.430
and yes, on occasion,
there have been sexual advances.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.799
- Laura Collett just woke up.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.001
Benson's on her way
to the hospital.

12:48.035 --> 12:51.238
Mr. Kessler, thank you.
We'll be in touch.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.540
- We, uh, we met on campus.

12:53.573 --> 12:56.009
Justin and I had just, uh,
taken a tour,

12:56.043 --> 12:58.545
and I was--I was getting coffee
at the café,

12:58.578 --> 13:02.449
and he, um...
he introduced himself to me.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.052
He said he worked
at the admissions office.

13:05.085 --> 13:08.055
- The night that you two were
at the Luxembourg Hotel,

13:08.088 --> 13:12.492
you sent him a text
that said, "Best sex ever."

13:12.525 --> 13:16.029
And then ten minutes later, you
sent him another text that said,

13:16.063 --> 13:19.032
"You raped me.
Burn in hell."

13:19.066 --> 13:21.168
So can you tell me what happened
in those ten minutes?

13:21.201 --> 13:24.004
- I figured out
he wasn't Alden Kessler.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.472
- How?

13:25.505 --> 13:27.040
- He mixed up
a few statistics.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.509
He said, um...

13:29.542 --> 13:32.179
said the endowment
was 9 billion.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.981
It's actually 13.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.182
- You got suspicious?

13:35.215 --> 13:37.050
- Yeah.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.586
- Had you Googled him or,
you know, looked him up?

13:39.619 --> 13:41.054
- I did,
and there he was

13:41.088 --> 13:44.491
on some professor's
Instagram page.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.928
Just right there,
and I'm...

13:47.961 --> 13:48.929
I mean, I'm stunned.

13:48.962 --> 13:49.997
I'm stunned, and I call him.

13:50.030 --> 13:53.934
I called this man that
I just had sex with, okay?

13:53.967 --> 13:58.505
And I confront him,
and he laughs at me.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.307
And he hangs up,
and I call him again,

14:00.340 --> 14:02.209
and--and--
and he doesn't answer,

14:02.242 --> 14:04.945
so I sent the text
about him raping me.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.546
I mean, I didn't--I didn't
mean it literally,

14:06.579 --> 14:09.649
but I wanted him to know

14:09.682 --> 14:12.953
how disgusting he was
and how upset I was,

14:12.986 --> 14:14.521
and then...

14:14.554 --> 14:16.223
[solemn music]

14:16.256 --> 14:18.125
[sniffles]

14:18.158 --> 14:22.896
- Did you mean
to hurt yourself?

14:22.930 --> 14:25.265
- No.
I was...

14:25.298 --> 14:28.068
I was trying
to numb the pain.

14:28.101 --> 14:32.172
*

14:32.205 --> 14:35.275
I would never abandon
my family.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.377
*

14:37.410 --> 14:41.648
- So you didn't know
the true identity of this man,

14:41.681 --> 14:44.317
which means
that you never consented

14:44.351 --> 14:47.554
to having sex with him.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.256
- Wait a minute.
What--what are you saying?

14:49.289 --> 14:52.993
What--what he did
was a crime?

14:53.026 --> 14:56.396
- I'm saying that what he did
to you is rape.

14:56.429 --> 15:00.400
*

15:00.433 --> 15:03.070
- She screwed some guy trying to
get her kid into college?

15:03.103 --> 15:05.238
- Quid pro quo.
- But she got played.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.040
Ended up having sex
with some jackass

15:07.074 --> 15:08.375
pretending to be
a big shot at Hudson.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.677
- Which makes it rape.
In her mind, anyway.

15:10.710 --> 15:14.047
- Just being real, lying to have
sex is just part of the game.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.115
I mean, back in the day,

15:15.148 --> 15:17.284
I pretended to be
Melle Mel's cousin one night.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.251
You trying to tell me
that was rape?

15:18.285 --> 15:21.354
- Things have changed, Fin.
- Not that much.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.024
Everybody's lying in the club.
Trust me on that.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.726
- No, no, she consented to
having sex with Alden Kessler,

15:26.759 --> 15:29.396
not some stranger
pretending to be Alden Kessler,

15:29.429 --> 15:31.999
so ask me, that's rape.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.334
Let's find this guy.
Do we have any leads?

15:34.367 --> 15:35.368
- No, not much.

15:35.402 --> 15:36.503
The wine bottle came back
negative for prints,

15:36.536 --> 15:39.339
and the only lead I got
when I was at Laura's townhouse,

15:39.372 --> 15:41.141
I found a few personal notes
written to her

15:41.174 --> 15:43.110
on Kessler's Hudson stationary.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.311
- Oh, that guy was selling it.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.279
- If it's really
Kessler's stationary

15:46.313 --> 15:50.283
that means that the suspect
has access to his office.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.319
Time to take another
college tour.

15:55.688 --> 15:58.191
- 68 grand a year for this?
I don't get all the fuss.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.360
- Yeah, me neither,
but a lot of people do.

16:00.393 --> 16:03.330
- Yeah, this imposter obviously
witnessed all the groveling

16:03.363 --> 16:05.198
and ass-kissing up close
and personal

16:05.232 --> 16:07.200
that goes on around here.
- Makes sense.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.369
He saw he had a captive
audience, decided to exploit it.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.771
- Yeah, but--right, but guys
have been doing that for years.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.774
Right? Lying, exaggerating,
manipulating.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.678
- You don't think it's rape?
- I-I think it's disgusting,

16:18.711 --> 16:20.447
but where do you
draw the line?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.216
Like, say this kid,
says he grew up on Fifth Avenue,

16:23.250 --> 16:25.685
but he's really
from Jersey City, or say a guy,

16:25.718 --> 16:27.754
he says he makes
200,000 grand a year,

16:27.787 --> 16:30.690
but he really only makes 100,
you know? I mean, is that rape?

16:30.723 --> 16:32.325
- This guy's different.
He's a predator.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.661
- Well,
I just don't like gray.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.363
We're cops, not lawyers.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.298
- Speak for yourself.
- [chuckles]

16:38.331 --> 16:40.300
I keep forgetting.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.669
- Is that an insult?
Go ahead.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.705
- Actually,
it's a compliment.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.311
- That's Tom Metcalf,
campus security.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.313
We hired him two months ago.

16:53.346 --> 16:57.150
We had about 20 extra people
during application season.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.219
Things can get little nuts.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.788
- A few days ago, I would have
found that hard to believe.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.091
- Why do you need Tom?
He in trouble?

17:04.124 --> 17:07.760
- No, no.
We just--we want to talk to him.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.729
- He punched out at 5:12.
- Can you call him?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.398
Find out where he is?
You know, pretend you got

17:11.431 --> 17:14.167
to talk to him
about work or something.

17:16.169 --> 17:19.139
[dark music]

17:19.172 --> 17:20.207
*

17:20.240 --> 17:22.409
[indistinct chatter]

17:22.442 --> 17:25.112
*

17:25.145 --> 17:26.813
- You know, I played
baseball at Vanderbilt.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.116
- You really work at Goldman?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.049
Don't take this
the wrong way,

17:30.083 --> 17:32.285
but you look like
a construction worker.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.421
- I produce movies.
Mostly comedies.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.156
You ever hear of the
"40-Year-Old-Virgin?"

17:36.189 --> 17:38.091
- No way.
That's one of my favorites.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.827
*

17:40.860 --> 17:42.829
- 34,000 applications.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.297
We accepted 10%.

17:44.331 --> 17:47.867
71% of those applicants
chose Hudson.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.537
We now have a yield rate
that's higher than Princeton.

17:50.570 --> 17:54.207
- How do you know all that,
Tom?

17:54.241 --> 17:55.775
- Tom?
My name is--

17:55.808 --> 17:59.279
- Let me guess.
Alden?

18:06.886 --> 18:07.019
.

18:07.053 --> 18:07.887
- Laura Collett overdosed?
That's horrible.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.525
- Well, she said
that you lied to her.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.161
That you pretended
to be Alden Kessler,

18:14.194 --> 18:17.130
and when she found out,
she got pretty upset.

18:17.164 --> 18:20.133
- That's terrible.
I'm--I'm so sorry.

18:20.167 --> 18:23.270
- So you admit you lied to her
about being somebody else?

18:23.303 --> 18:25.172
- I told her I worked
in admissions,

18:25.205 --> 18:27.240
and I left out the fact
that I was a security guard,

18:27.274 --> 18:28.541
and she made assumptions.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.278
You know, as far as I know,
that's not a crime.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.512
I even looked it up.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.880
- Well, we're just trying
to figure out

18:33.913 --> 18:34.947
what happened that night.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.284
I mean, I got to do my job,
but between you and me,

18:37.317 --> 18:38.551
I don't even know
why you're here.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.521
Honestly, I dated this chick
once in college.

18:41.554 --> 18:42.555
I dated her
for a whole semester.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.325
She thought I was
an exchange student from Italy.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.626
It was the best sex
I ever had.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.528
- Yeah, well, that whole
foreign thing works with,

18:48.561 --> 18:49.929
you know,
a certain niche audience.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.864
- This guy thinks
he's pretty clever, huh?

18:51.898 --> 18:54.367
- So does this guy.

18:54.401 --> 18:57.904
- So is it just college moms,
or do you work other angles too?

18:57.937 --> 18:59.472
- What's the point
of this meeting?

18:59.506 --> 19:02.575
- Look, Tom, I need
to hear your side of this

19:02.609 --> 19:05.212
before things
get blown out of proportion.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.180
- My side, it's simple.
I met Laura.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.482
We had a few dates.
That's that.

19:09.516 --> 19:13.220
- Have you ever impersonated
other people?

19:13.253 --> 19:15.288
Come on, man to man.

19:15.322 --> 19:18.191
- Like I said,
it's not against the law.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.293
If you ask me,
it's a brilliant strategy,

19:20.327 --> 19:21.594
like taking advantage
of the tax code.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.663
You find a loophole,
you exploit it.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.332
- Well, you got nothing
to worry about.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.199
- That's my point.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.600
- So you have
impersonated other people?

19:27.634 --> 19:29.336
- Of course.
- Well, let me guess.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.437
Hedge fund guy, right?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.372
- Oh, please,
that's for rookies.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.906
I play much more
sophisticated angles.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.609
- Oh, such as?

19:36.643 --> 19:38.645
- I used to work security
in a medical building.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.247
Heard all this lingo.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.316
Next thing you know,
the neurologist is in the house.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.684
- Hmm.

19:44.717 --> 19:49.356
- "Amy, my main focus
is neuromuscular disease,

19:49.389 --> 19:53.226
"but if truth be told,

19:53.260 --> 19:56.529
my true passion is poetry."

19:56.563 --> 19:58.331
- That is genius.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.433
- It's all about
the humble brag.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.635
I'm writing a book about
all this to help regular guys

20:02.669 --> 20:04.704
close the deal
with beautiful women.

20:04.737 --> 20:05.872
- Let's go back
to Laura though, all right?

20:05.905 --> 20:09.509
Did she actually ever say yes
to you, to Tom, before sex?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.644
Or did she just think
she was about to get after it

20:11.678 --> 20:14.647
with some hot shot
from Hudson?

20:14.681 --> 20:16.649
- Am I under arrest?

20:16.683 --> 20:18.651
[tense music]

20:18.685 --> 20:19.686
- No.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.654
*

20:21.688 --> 20:23.656
- Then I'm out of here.

20:23.690 --> 20:30.363
*

20:31.431 --> 20:33.600
I'm gonna send you
a copy of my book.

20:33.633 --> 20:37.003
If you're nice, I might even
autograph it for you.

20:37.036 --> 20:42.742
*

20:42.775 --> 20:45.044
- It sounds like
Rape by Fraud.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.013
The problem is that doesn't
exist in New York criminal code.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.981
- I know, but we can't
just let this guy walk.

20:49.015 --> 20:52.452
There's got to be
some kind of statute or theory

20:52.485 --> 20:55.555
that we can use to prosecute
this kind of vile behavior.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.690
- People vs. Hough, 1994.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.059
A twin tricks his brother's wife
into having sex with him.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.661
The court rules
there was wrongdoing,

21:01.694 --> 21:03.062
but no crime was committed

21:03.095 --> 21:05.532
since the law doesn't cover
that type of behavior.

21:05.565 --> 21:08.701
- Okay, so maybe it's time
we update New York law

21:08.735 --> 21:12.505
into the 21st Century.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.474
- Well, there have been
rumblings about

21:14.507 --> 21:16.776
a new bill in the legislature
- Okay.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.078
- A case like this
could kick start things.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.580
Are you sure the victim
is willing to testify?

21:20.613 --> 21:23.015
- I will talk to her.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.318
- And our repugnant ladies' man,
he's done this before?

21:25.352 --> 21:26.753
- Well, it sounds like it.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.088
He told Carisi
that he was writing a book

21:29.121 --> 21:30.757
about his various conquests.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.825
- If we can establish
a consistent pattern,

21:32.859 --> 21:34.427
it would help sway the jury.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.629
- Great, I'll need a warrant
to keep digging.

21:36.663 --> 21:37.730
- Yeah.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.601
- Do I need to stick around
for this?

21:41.634 --> 21:43.370
- Well, it's better you stay,
if you don't mind.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.472
- This guy Metcalf
a criminal?

21:45.505 --> 21:46.773
- A person of interest.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.476
- Rollins,
"Dr. Michael Mandlebaum,

21:49.509 --> 21:50.777
Stanford University
Medical School."

21:50.810 --> 21:53.513
- Huh, the guy
definitely backstops.

21:58.585 --> 22:01.454
[scoffs]
Hey, check this out.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.790
- "My Mali Journey,"
Stephanie Dowling.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.492
- I mean,
he's got desperate moms

22:05.525 --> 22:07.360
submitting their kids
work to him.

22:07.394 --> 22:09.796
- Hmm, look.
Look at that.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.063
- "Alden, thanks
for reading this.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.832
"Stephanie is
a special young lady.

22:12.865 --> 22:15.101
"See you tomorrow afternoon
at the Strathmore.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.503
Can't wait.
Erin."

22:16.536 --> 22:17.637
- It sounds like
another potential vic.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.106
What's the Strathmore?
- A new luxury building in Soho.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.474
Prices start at 10 million.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.709
- Oh, and Metcalf's got
a place there?

22:22.742 --> 22:23.910
- Sounds like another con.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.513
- When was that note sent?
- Yesterday. Today's the day.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.614
- All right,
we might be able to stop this.

22:27.647 --> 22:28.648
I'll call Liv.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.518
*

22:31.551 --> 22:34.721
- Erin Dowling's phone is still
going straight to her voicemail.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.389
- Excuse me.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.658
Lieutenant Benson from SVU.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.660
Have you seen this man?

22:40.693 --> 22:41.861
- Our tenants
are very private.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.530
Is there something else
I can help you with?

22:43.563 --> 22:46.132
- It's an emergency.
- That's Mr. Kessler.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.634
Look, I just clocked in.
I haven't seen him.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.802
- He lives here?
- He stays in Mr. Zeng's place

22:49.836 --> 22:51.571
sometimes.
24B.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.172
What's going on?

22:53.205 --> 22:59.712
*

23:00.780 --> 23:01.814
- Oh, hey.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.816
[chuckles]
Small world.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.818
Benson, right?
We met the other day.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.487
- Erin Dowling up there?
- Yeah.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.956
She's probably catching
her breath right about now.

23:09.989 --> 23:13.426
- You know you got
a stupid smile, right?

23:13.460 --> 23:16.529
- Are you threatening me,
Detective?

23:16.563 --> 23:17.930
- Let him go, Fin.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.699
*

23:19.732 --> 23:22.469
- And he's done this to other
prospective Hudson moms?

23:22.502 --> 23:25.905
- Yes, he gets off on taking
advantage of anxious women.

23:25.938 --> 23:28.608
- Look, I know
that this is traumatic--

23:28.641 --> 23:30.777
- More like humiliating.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.945
My husband and I have spent
over a $1/2 million

23:32.979 --> 23:34.481
on our daughter's education.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.749
We want a return
on our investment,

23:36.783 --> 23:41.420
but the college
admissions process is...brutal.

23:42.522 --> 23:45.224
My daughter's smart,
but normal smart,

23:45.257 --> 23:46.993
not prodigy smart,

23:47.026 --> 23:48.861
and she's not a minority,

23:48.895 --> 23:52.499
or an elite athlete,
or violinist.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.967
- Okay, so where'd you meet him?
- The café on Hudson's campus.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.969
My daughter was there.
He approached me.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.639
- And you thought he was
Alden Kessler till right now?

23:59.672 --> 24:00.707
- Yes.

24:00.740 --> 24:03.743
- I am so sorry,
but I want you to know

24:03.776 --> 24:05.878
that we intend to
prosecute this man

24:05.912 --> 24:07.714
for what he's done,

24:07.747 --> 24:10.483
and we hope that we can count
on you to cooperate.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.652
- Are you joking?

24:12.685 --> 24:14.621
You want me to tell the world
that I was willing to sleep

24:14.654 --> 24:16.789
with the admissions director
to get my daughter into college?

24:16.823 --> 24:19.926
- You didn't consent
to having sex with Tom Metcalf.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.227
He defrauded you.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.762
- We were two adults
playing a game,

24:22.795 --> 24:25.765
and the hustler got hustled.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.500
Lesson learned.

24:27.534 --> 24:28.935
*

24:28.968 --> 24:30.870
- What now?

24:30.903 --> 24:31.971
- Well, a crime was committed.

24:32.004 --> 24:35.241
Process it like
any other case.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.243
- I'll call CSU.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.546
*

24:39.579 --> 24:41.581
- Well, sir, I appreciate
your cooperation.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.916
Thank you so much.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.687
That was the owner
of Metcalf's sex pad.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.522
By the way,
it's cloudy in Hong Kong.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.524
- Does he know Metcalf?
- Never heard of him.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.859
- Then how'd he get
in that condo?

24:52.892 --> 24:53.960
- Don't know.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.228
CSU find anything
in Zeng's apartment?

24:56.262 --> 24:58.865
- Yeah, actually,
something good.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.833
Our imposter...

25:00.867 --> 25:03.703
is a filmmaker, too.

25:07.774 --> 25:10.076
- Showed compassion,
breadth of experience...

25:10.109 --> 25:12.879
- So you think it will
help her chances?

25:12.912 --> 25:15.281
- I believe it will make her
more competitive

25:15.314 --> 25:18.084
and allow me to advocate

25:18.117 --> 25:19.852
more passionately
on her behalf.

25:19.886 --> 25:20.953
- Oh, we're not done.
There's more.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.254
- Well...

25:22.288 --> 25:23.590
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

25:23.623 --> 25:27.259
Just, uh, Justin came in third
at a cross country meet.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.696
He wants to go out
to dinner to celebrate,

25:29.729 --> 25:34.066
so...I think I should go.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.902
- The camera was hidden?

25:35.935 --> 25:38.571
- He cut a hole
in the dresser.

25:38.605 --> 25:39.639
- You're sure
Metcalf filmed this?

25:39.672 --> 25:42.575
- CSU's running the camera
for prints, touch DNA,

25:42.609 --> 25:45.712
but he's clearly
the leader of the clubhouse.

25:45.745 --> 25:46.813
- How many women
are on that tape?

25:46.846 --> 25:48.080
- Five, all mothers,

25:48.114 --> 25:50.983
all trying to help their kid
get into Hudson.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.585
- Have you identified
the other women?

25:52.619 --> 25:53.986
- Yes, we have, everyone,

25:54.020 --> 25:57.590
but none of them are interested
in filing a complaint.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.125
- Understandable.
- Which is why he keeps doing

25:59.158 --> 26:00.860
what he is doing.
- Well, he's revolting.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.763
There's no question, but the
victim isn't exactly perfect.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.665
- I completely agree
with you.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.634
She made a horrific decision,

26:07.667 --> 26:12.004
but this case is about
something bigger than Laura.

26:12.038 --> 26:15.307
How many more women are we gonna
let this guy victimize?

26:15.341 --> 26:19.779
I mean, win or lose, we need
to make a statement here.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.782
- Okay.
You win.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.150
Pick him up.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.885
*

26:25.918 --> 26:27.787
- We're doing
the right thing.

26:27.820 --> 26:30.022
- I know.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.792
That's what I'm worried about.

26:39.365 --> 26:39.498
.

26:39.531 --> 26:40.199
- Yes, I had sex
with these women,

26:40.967 --> 26:44.203
but I never recorded
a damn thing.

26:44.236 --> 26:47.740
- Mr. Metcalf, you can con
your desperate soccer moms,

26:47.774 --> 26:49.275
but you can't con us.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.844
- I never taped a damn thing.
- Okay, so who did?

26:51.878 --> 26:53.212
Mr. Zeng?

26:53.245 --> 26:55.147
- What am I even doing here?

26:55.181 --> 26:56.783
I've done nothing wrong.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.217
Since when is
having sex a crime?

26:58.250 --> 27:00.687
- What you did isn't sex.
Trust me.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.689
- If you arrested every guy
who ever lied to get women,

27:02.722 --> 27:04.190
you'd have 50 million men
in prison.

27:04.223 --> 27:05.792
- We're not here to debate
the ethics of your behavior,

27:05.825 --> 27:07.827
but we are willing
to discuss a deal.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.762
If you are willing
to plead guilty

27:09.796 --> 27:11.330
to sexual assault
in the third degree--

27:11.363 --> 27:14.233
- Sexual assault?
You kidding me?

27:14.266 --> 27:15.702
These chicks
were begging for it.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.236
If anything,
they assaulted me.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.705
- Yes or no?

27:18.738 --> 27:20.707
- Kiss my ass.

27:20.740 --> 27:24.210
- Mr. Metcalf,
you are under arrest.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.412
You have the right
to remain silent.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.479
Anything you say

27:27.513 --> 27:31.217
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

27:31.250 --> 27:35.755
- Okay, so this prosecutor's
gonna file rape charges?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.356
- Yes.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.759
Hey, Justin.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.794
How you doing?

27:43.963 --> 27:46.833
- Sorry, he's just--
he's having a hard time.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.935
- Understandable.
- He's just--he's terrified

27:48.968 --> 27:50.737
all of this
is gonna become public,

27:50.770 --> 27:54.273
so...
[sighs]

27:54.306 --> 27:56.142
You think we can
win this case?

27:56.175 --> 27:59.912
- I think that we have
a pretty decent chance,

27:59.946 --> 28:03.349
and we are going to need you
to testify,

28:03.382 --> 28:04.884
to stand up there,

28:04.917 --> 28:09.856
tell that jury the depths
of Metcalf's deceit.

28:09.889 --> 28:12.258
- It's just, you know,
my family, they're, um...

28:12.291 --> 28:14.727
they're ashamed,
as you just saw.

28:14.761 --> 28:19.732
I mean, this Metcalf guy,
he--it's like he--

28:19.766 --> 28:23.235
he saw how weak and vulnerable
I was, you know?

28:23.269 --> 28:26.472
And he knew--he knew
how obsessed I was

28:26.505 --> 28:28.007
with getting Justin
into Hudson.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.475
- I understand.

28:29.508 --> 28:33.913
It's very easy to get lost

28:33.946 --> 28:35.748
in this private school
madness.

28:35.782 --> 28:38.785
- And he preys on every weakness
and--and doubt you possess.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.487
I just--I feel so stupid

28:41.520 --> 28:44.256
and pathetic.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.993
But what he did, I mean,
he--he made me hate myself

28:47.026 --> 28:49.996
even more than I do,
which is not easy.

28:50.029 --> 28:52.999
[solemn music]

28:53.032 --> 28:54.366
*

28:54.400 --> 28:56.235
I want him to feel
the humiliation

28:56.268 --> 28:58.370
and pain that I felt.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.373
*

29:01.407 --> 29:04.343
- We're gonna do our best,
Laura.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.779
*

29:06.813 --> 29:09.248
That I can promise you.
- Okay.

29:09.281 --> 29:12.318
*

29:12.351 --> 29:13.886
- First off, there is no proof

29:13.920 --> 29:16.422
that my client actually
recorded these sex tapes.

29:16.455 --> 29:19.859
None. Moreover, Laura Collett is
the only woman on these tapes

29:19.892 --> 29:21.393
who's filed a police report.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.062
The other women
have not come forward,

29:23.095 --> 29:26.398
and they have refused to
cooperate with the prosecution.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.901
As such,
these tapes are irrelevant,

29:28.935 --> 29:30.369
and without question,

29:30.402 --> 29:32.571
more prejudicial
than probative.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.041
If the prosecution wants
to talk about sex tapes

29:35.074 --> 29:36.042
then they should charge
my client

29:36.075 --> 29:37.476
with unlawful surveillance.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.345
- Don't worry, we intend to.
- That's great,

29:39.378 --> 29:41.080
but we're here
to try a rape case.

29:41.113 --> 29:44.884
So the video pertaining
to Mrs. Collett is admissible.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.953
The rest of it stays out.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.088
- Your Honor, there's a pattern
of conduct here--

29:49.121 --> 29:52.959
- Like I said,
Laura Collett is in.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.394
The other ladies are out.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.304
Being a prosecutor
isn't enough.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.073
You want to be
a legislator, too.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.275
- Excuse me?

30:10.542 --> 30:12.511
- Correct me if I'm wrong,
Mr. Barba,

30:12.544 --> 30:14.847
but your job is to bring cases
that are actually crimes

30:14.881 --> 30:16.015
under the New York
Criminal Code.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.850
- We presented the facts
to the grand jury,

30:17.884 --> 30:19.385
who delivered an indictment.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.320
- I once indicted a ham
and cheese sandwich

30:21.353 --> 30:22.421
for triple homicide.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.556
- Well, the defense filed
the motion to dismiss--

30:24.590 --> 30:25.992
- You want me to kick
a rape case

30:26.025 --> 30:27.393
in this political climate

30:27.426 --> 30:31.397
without hearing
all of the evidence?

30:31.430 --> 30:34.033
What's really going on here?
You want press?

30:34.066 --> 30:36.002
You're laying the bed
for a political run?

30:36.035 --> 30:37.536
- With all due respect,
Judge Bertuccio,

30:37.569 --> 30:38.938
you're out of line.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.539
- Oh, be careful, Counselor.

30:40.572 --> 30:41.607
Just because
you preface something

30:41.640 --> 30:44.343
with "all due respect"
doesn't mean it's respectable.

30:44.376 --> 30:47.579
- I didn't intend to--
- Do not use my courtroom

30:47.613 --> 30:48.915
for your own agenda.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.983
Do you hear me?

30:51.017 --> 30:52.651
- Are you asking me
to dismiss the case?

30:52.684 --> 30:53.886
- No, no.
[chuckles]

30:53.920 --> 30:55.054
I would never
ask a prosecutor

30:55.087 --> 30:56.555
to dismiss a case
that he believes

30:56.588 --> 30:58.925
is worthy of
the court's time.

30:58.958 --> 31:02.428
That would be an abuse
of judicial power.

31:02.461 --> 31:05.431
[tense music]

31:05.464 --> 31:09.635
*

31:09.668 --> 31:12.171
- Laura Collett met
the defendant on the campus

31:12.204 --> 31:14.440
of Hudson University.

31:14.473 --> 31:17.176
He pretended to be
a man named Alden Kessler,

31:17.209 --> 31:19.445
the Director of Admissions
of Hudson.

31:19.478 --> 31:23.349
Laura and the defendant began
to communicate, socialize.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.650
Eventually, they had sex,

31:24.683 --> 31:27.053
but Laura Collett thought

31:27.086 --> 31:30.056
she was having sex
with Alden Kessler,

31:30.089 --> 31:32.358
a distinguished academic
from Philadelphia

31:32.391 --> 31:33.960
and a graduate of Harvard,

31:33.993 --> 31:35.928
not Tom Metcalf,

31:35.962 --> 31:39.431
an undistinguished security
guard from Ridgewood, Queens,

31:39.465 --> 31:42.068
and a graduate of
P.S. 346.

31:42.101 --> 31:45.604
As such, Laura Collett
never consented

31:45.637 --> 31:46.605
to having sex
with the defendant.

31:46.638 --> 31:51.477
She consented to having sex
with Alden Kessler.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.212
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is not a lie.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.147
It's not a clever ruse.

31:55.181 --> 31:57.183
It's rape.

31:59.651 --> 32:04.490
- My client, Tom Metcalf,
is an imaginative,

32:04.523 --> 32:07.159
fast-talking,
self-proclaimed ladies' man.

32:07.193 --> 32:10.462
Sure, he exaggerates
and embellishes

32:10.496 --> 32:14.233
the facts and circumstances
of his humble, mediocre life.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.402
Not too long ago,

32:16.435 --> 32:18.971
guys like this were
called pickup artists

32:19.005 --> 32:21.073
or playboys.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.174
Today, in an attempt

32:22.208 --> 32:24.110
to gain media
attention for himself

32:24.143 --> 32:26.645
and to advance
his own personal,

32:26.678 --> 32:29.481
liberal, political agenda,

32:29.515 --> 32:33.619
Mr. Barba wants to
call them rapists.

32:37.589 --> 32:40.659
- Laura, did you ever agree
to have sex with Tom Metcalf?

32:40.692 --> 32:42.261
- No.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.662
I never would have
spent time with him,

32:43.695 --> 32:47.133
let alone...
have sex with him,

32:47.166 --> 32:48.667
if I knew
who he really was.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.603
- Why?
- Because my only objective

32:51.637 --> 32:54.673
was to help my son
get into Hudson.

32:54.706 --> 32:57.509
It was more of
a business transaction.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.245
- Thank you.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.546
Nothing further.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.448
- A business transaction?

33:02.481 --> 33:03.515
Like a prostitute?

33:03.549 --> 33:05.651
- Objection.
- Overruled.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.686
Answer the question.

33:10.156 --> 33:13.725
- I didn't think
of it like that.

33:13.759 --> 33:17.196
He didn't give me money,
but...

33:17.229 --> 33:18.564
I-I suppose you're right.

33:18.597 --> 33:19.498
I was giving him sex,

33:19.531 --> 33:22.301
and he was giving me
something of value,

33:22.334 --> 33:24.070
immense value, in return.

33:24.103 --> 33:28.574
Again, I'm not--
I'm not proud of what I did.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.643
I was just trying
to help my son,

33:31.677 --> 33:35.714
and I know--
I know this sounds silly, but...

33:35.747 --> 33:38.084
I dropped out of college
after two years,

33:38.117 --> 33:42.188
and I just--I just
wanted him to be better.

33:42.221 --> 33:46.158
I wanted him to enjoy
all the--all the things

33:46.192 --> 33:49.695
that a prestigious college
education offers.

33:49.728 --> 33:52.598
I was...

33:52.631 --> 33:54.733
willing to do anything.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.102
I mean, we have money

33:56.135 --> 33:58.637
but not enough
to buy our way,

33:58.670 --> 34:02.841
so I...I thought--
I thought this would help.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.211
- Using sex to influence
a decision

34:05.244 --> 34:07.346
that's meant
to be based on merit?

34:07.379 --> 34:09.215
It's a hell of a way
to help your son.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.750
- I think we get the idea,
Miss Staines. Move on.

34:11.783 --> 34:15.321
- So, Mrs. Collett,

34:15.354 --> 34:18.690
minutes before you overdosed
on Valium and alcohol,

34:18.724 --> 34:22.094
you sent a text
to Mr. Metcalf saying,

34:22.128 --> 34:23.362
"Incredible night.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.197
"Just gonna say it.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.599
Best sex ever."

34:27.633 --> 34:31.237
But now you're saying you
didn't consent to having sex.

34:31.270 --> 34:34.806
- I sent the text before
I knew who he was,

34:34.840 --> 34:36.808
and I was just
pretending I enjoyed it.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.711
- So you lied?

34:39.745 --> 34:41.613
- Yes.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.715
- What else are you lying about,
Mrs. Collett?

34:43.749 --> 34:45.851
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.653
Nothing further.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.188
[tense music]

34:49.221 --> 34:51.257
- Laura, did you send
the defendant

34:51.290 --> 34:53.292
another text message that night?

34:53.325 --> 34:55.294
- Yes, when I found out

34:55.327 --> 34:58.230
who he was,

34:58.264 --> 35:01.633
I texted him again.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.370
I said that he raped me

35:04.403 --> 35:07.173
and I hoped he burned
in hell.

35:07.206 --> 35:11.610
*

35:11.643 --> 35:13.345
- The People rest.

35:13.379 --> 35:16.915
*

35:16.948 --> 35:20.719
- The Defense calls Gary Bell.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.621
- Your Honor,
may I approach?

35:22.654 --> 35:27.693
*

35:27.726 --> 35:29.195
Gary Bell's
not on the witness list.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.829
We have no idea who he is
or why he's being called.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.698
- He's a doorman
at the Strathmore.

35:32.731 --> 35:33.932
He just recently
came forward.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.268
- And what is the crux
of his testimony?

35:36.302 --> 35:40.406
- That he heard Mrs. Collett
refer to Tom Metcalf as Tom,

35:40.439 --> 35:43.309
not Alden.
She knew who Metcalf was.

35:43.342 --> 35:45.177
After the third or fourth time
they had sex,

35:45.211 --> 35:46.178
Metcalf came clean.

35:46.212 --> 35:47.846
He told her who he really was,

35:47.879 --> 35:50.416
and she kept sleeping
with him anyway.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.951
So much for no consent.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.854
*

35:55.887 --> 35:57.256
- Metcalf says that
you knew his real name,

35:57.289 --> 35:58.724
that you had sex with him
three or four times.

35:58.757 --> 35:59.758
- That's a lie!

35:59.791 --> 36:02.728
We had sex once, at the hotel,
and that is it,

36:02.761 --> 36:05.631
and I never--I never knew
his real name until that night.

36:05.664 --> 36:06.832
Why would I put myself
through all this

36:06.865 --> 36:08.967
if I knew
who this pig really was?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.270
My son can barely look at me!

36:11.303 --> 36:13.205
My husband is going
to file for divorce.

36:13.239 --> 36:15.374
- We believe you.
We do.

36:15.407 --> 36:18.210
Now, do you remember
seeing this man?

36:18.244 --> 36:20.646
Gary Bell, he was the doorman
at the building

36:20.679 --> 36:21.880
where you two
had drinks one night.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.782
- I don't know.
I don't know--maybe.

36:23.815 --> 36:27.786
What difference does it make?
I never called him Tom, ever.

36:31.490 --> 36:34.426
He's gonna get away
with this, isn't he?

36:34.460 --> 36:36.295
This whole--this whole thing,
this whole case

36:36.328 --> 36:40.366
has been
a big waste of time.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.501
Why did you tell me
to testify?

36:56.915 --> 36:57.048
.

36:57.082 --> 36:58.016
- Okay, so what do we know
about this doorman?

36:58.950 --> 37:00.486
- He and Metcalf went
to the same high school.

37:00.519 --> 37:01.887
Found the yearbook online.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.589
Here's a picture of them
together in shop class.

37:03.622 --> 37:04.890
- So they know each other,

37:04.923 --> 37:06.292
but why is he willing
to lie for him

37:06.325 --> 37:08.694
and give him access
to a luxury condo?

37:08.727 --> 37:09.961
- It's about
more than friendship.

37:09.995 --> 37:12.964
I spoke with Bell's supervisor
at the last hotel he worked at--

37:12.998 --> 37:15.334
- He was the night manager
at the Mapleton, right?

37:15.367 --> 37:16.735
- Till he got fired
for setting up

37:16.768 --> 37:18.570
a camera
in the women's restroom.

37:18.604 --> 37:20.906
- Well, there you go.
He's a watcher.

37:20.939 --> 37:24.009
- No wonder we never found any
sex tapes on Metcalf's computer.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.377
- Because he wasn't
filming the vics.

37:25.411 --> 37:26.412
His friend Bell was.

37:26.445 --> 37:29.348
- Okay, but CSU said
that there were no prints

37:29.381 --> 37:31.049
and no evidence
on that camera.

37:31.082 --> 37:34.720
- Yeah, but the doorman
doesn't know that.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.393
- I'm not sure
what we're doing here.

37:41.427 --> 37:44.062
Mr. Bell's testimony
is not going to change.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.497
He heard what he heard.

37:45.531 --> 37:48.367
- And he filmed what he filmed.
- Sorry?

37:48.400 --> 37:49.601
- You filmed
your friend Metcalf

37:49.635 --> 37:51.470
and his various
victims having sex.

37:51.503 --> 37:52.404
- I didn't film nothing.

37:52.438 --> 37:54.072
- Your fingerprints were
all over the camera.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.541
You might as well
have autographed it.

37:55.574 --> 37:56.708
- Unlawful surveillance
is a felony.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.944
That means prison, and we'll be
filing those charges soon.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.946
The only question is...

38:00.979 --> 38:04.716
will I also be filing
perjury charges?

38:04.750 --> 38:08.053
- You agreed to lie for Metcalf
because he threatened to out you

38:08.086 --> 38:10.622
for making those
illegal sex videos, right?

38:10.656 --> 38:13.392
But now that we know
about those videos too,

38:13.425 --> 38:15.494
you got no reason
to lie for Metcalf.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.596
- I'd err on the side
of telling the truth.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.732
Probably gonna be better for you
in the long run.

38:20.766 --> 38:23.569
- Maybe I misheard--
- No, no, stop talking.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.706
If, for some reason,

38:27.739 --> 38:31.076
my client thinks
he made a mistake,

38:31.109 --> 38:32.644
you'll take that into account
when it comes time

38:32.678 --> 38:35.681
to plead out the illegal
surveillance charge?

38:37.449 --> 38:40.419
[dark music]

38:40.452 --> 38:42.988
- Your Honor, the Defense no
longer plans to call Gary Bell.

38:43.021 --> 38:46.057
In fact, we don't intend
to call any witnesses.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.794
- You're, uh, resting case
before presenting it?

38:48.827 --> 38:50.696
- Correct.

38:50.729 --> 38:53.098
- You wish to present a closing
argument, Miss Staines?

38:53.131 --> 38:54.099
- Yes, Your Honor.

38:54.132 --> 38:58.537
Ladies and gentlemen,
my client isn't perfect.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.039
Truth is,
he's not even decent.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.842
If he tried to date me,
I would laugh at him,

39:03.875 --> 39:05.677
or I'd punch him in the face.

39:05.711 --> 39:12.083
What I'm saying is,
he's disgusting, not a rapist.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.820
Mr. Metcalf is a sad,
frustrated man

39:14.853 --> 39:17.456
who longed for success
but never found it,

39:17.489 --> 39:21.059
so he creates characters
in his mind,

39:21.092 --> 39:23.429
successful,
respected characters,

39:23.462 --> 39:25.096
like an actor

39:25.130 --> 39:28.434
or an undercover detective
might do,

39:28.467 --> 39:31.503
and in the course of assuming
these alternate identities,

39:31.537 --> 39:33.839
he meets lots of women

39:33.872 --> 39:36.442
and sometimes
has sex with them.

39:36.475 --> 39:39.144
It's not an ethical
or moral way

39:39.177 --> 39:41.480
to conduct
one's romantic life,

39:41.513 --> 39:45.116
but it's not criminal,
either.

39:45.150 --> 39:48.620
Mr. Barba wants this court
to pass judgment

39:48.654 --> 39:51.657
on my client
for lying to women,

39:51.690 --> 39:54.460
but as of right now,
being a jackass

39:54.493 --> 39:57.629
isn't a crime
under New York law,

39:57.663 --> 39:59.865
which means that you,
the jury,

39:59.898 --> 40:01.733
have a legal obligation

40:01.767 --> 40:05.771
to find Tom Metcalf
not guilty.

40:05.804 --> 40:09.775
*

40:09.808 --> 40:11.777
- A compelling closing,
Miss Staines.

40:11.810 --> 40:12.911
- Thank you.

40:12.944 --> 40:17.649
- And I'm sure the jury
found it persuasive, as well.

40:17.683 --> 40:19.084
How about you,
Mr. Barba?

40:19.117 --> 40:20.886
What was your take?

40:20.919 --> 40:24.122
Did you find it illuminating,
per chance?

40:24.155 --> 40:26.525
- Your Honor,
I stand by the evidence.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.660
- I don't care
about the evidence.

40:28.694 --> 40:32.197
I care about the law,
or the lack thereof.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.533
You're a talented prosecutor
with a bright future,

40:34.566 --> 40:36.201
and if I were you,
I would take Miss Staines out

40:36.234 --> 40:37.569
for a cup
of that gourmet coffee

40:37.603 --> 40:39.170
everyone drinks nowadays

40:39.204 --> 40:43.141
and beg her to accept the plea
to a lesser charge,

40:43.174 --> 40:46.645
which I'm sure she'll accept,
because she's a reasonable woman

40:46.678 --> 40:50.916
and knows that her client
is a repulsive human being.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.685
Judges and prosecutors
are supposed to enforce the laws

40:53.719 --> 40:56.221
that exist, not the ones
they think should exist,

40:56.254 --> 40:58.757
and when they lose sight
of that,

40:58.790 --> 41:01.159
they run the risk of getting
their pants pulled down

41:01.192 --> 41:06.665
in public and having their
sterling reputations sullied.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.937
- Criminal impersonation
in the second degree?

41:11.970 --> 41:13.772
That's a misdemeanor.
- It's the best I could do.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.174
Bertuccio was prepared
to overturn the verdict.

41:16.207 --> 41:17.543
- Wait, he said that?

41:17.576 --> 41:20.679
- In so many words.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.881
- Have you told Laura?
- No.

41:22.914 --> 41:25.684
I called her a few times,
but I don't know where she is.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.886
- Okay, I'll find her.

41:27.919 --> 41:30.488
Break the news to her
in person.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.892

41:33.925 --> 41:35.894
[siren wailing]

41:35.927 --> 41:37.162
*

41:37.195 --> 41:38.630
What happened?

41:38.664 --> 41:42.534
Mr. Collett, is it Laura?

41:42.568 --> 41:44.302
Watch him.

41:44.335 --> 41:45.971
Excuse me.
Coming through.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.774
- Oh, no, my baby!
[sobbing]

41:48.807 --> 41:50.776
Oh, my baby!

41:50.809 --> 41:52.611
Oh, no!

41:52.644 --> 41:58.884

42:01.920 --> 42:04.289
*

42:04.322 --> 42:06.758
No!
