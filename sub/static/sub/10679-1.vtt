WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:05.890
- Sheep rustling? - Yeah. - Sheep
rustling? - Yeah. - As in, "Yeehah!"?

00:05.939 --> 00:07.930
No, there were no cowboys involved.

00:07.980 --> 00:10.690
No, good point, that would
have been cattle rustling.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.930
No, this is sheep rustling,
North Halifax style,

00:12.980 --> 00:16.530
so there's just the one sheep and
three lads off their heads on acid.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.530
Shit!

00:23.300 --> 00:24.450
Look at that!

00:24.500 --> 00:29.170
I managed to shoo them off, the
dogs. Would you like a cup of tea?

00:31.340 --> 00:32.980
Yeah, tea, perfect. Thank you.

00:52.860 --> 00:56.650
- You didn't? - They'd mauled
it, the dogs had, I had to.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.290
There was no way it was going to survive

00:58.340 --> 00:59.770
and it was obviously in distress.

00:59.820 --> 01:03.010
Can you really not find me a
vet in the whole of Calderdale?

01:03.060 --> 01:05.250
- So you did it?
- Well, that was the plan.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.290
Do you take milk and su...?

01:07.340 --> 01:10.050
Er, no. Yeah, no, thank you.

01:10.100 --> 01:12.890
And yeah, go on, sugar, two sugars.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.370
One sugar.

01:14.420 --> 01:15.820
Thank you.

01:20.980 --> 01:23.850
Oh, and it made this noise, it was like...

01:23.900 --> 01:25.890
God knows, so then I had to do it again,

01:25.940 --> 01:28.330
cos it was still alive, and then...

01:28.380 --> 01:30.410
seemed all right after that.

01:30.460 --> 01:33.250
- All right, as in dead?
- I'm so thrilled you're finding this funny.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.610
- I don't know how you do it.
- Farmer weren't laughing.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.540
They never do, do they, according to you.

01:40.340 --> 01:42.010
It's not the first time.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.850
Lads come up off the estate,

01:43.900 --> 01:47.370
off their heads on God knows
what, and then they take one.

01:47.420 --> 01:51.930
Really? And what is it you think they
do with 'em when they've got 'em?

01:51.980 --> 01:55.610
- Sell 'em, eat 'em. God knows how.
- They're gimmers, they're not hoggs.

01:55.660 --> 01:59.130
They're for breeding, not eating.
Meat'll be tough as an old boot.

01:59.180 --> 02:02.020
They wouldn't know that, though,
would they? They're stupid.

02:03.820 --> 02:07.570
It's what happened next that was
really comical. Well, I say comical.

02:07.620 --> 02:10.090
I'd been back at the nick
maybe an hour, hour and a half.

02:10.139 --> 02:12.650
And there's another call.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.420
- Catherine?
- Joyce?

02:15.580 --> 02:17.860
I think we may have
entered the Twilight Zone.

02:21.500 --> 02:26.170
- This is like some crazy weird shit, man.
- There's no external injuries.

02:26.220 --> 02:28.850
Happened they've been poisoned.

02:28.900 --> 02:32.210
'So, OK, so I didn't mean comical
exactly, I meant more ironic,

02:32.260 --> 02:33.570
'the way it turned out.'

02:33.620 --> 02:37.090
Nicky Baxter, the vet from Bolton
Brow, he's managed to get up there

02:37.140 --> 02:41.090
sooner that he'd anticipated so he's
given the sheep a fatal injection.

02:41.140 --> 02:44.530
I thought I'd finished the poor
little sod off, but God knows,

02:44.580 --> 02:45.850
I mustn't have.

02:45.900 --> 02:49.290
So, the sheep's got pentobarbital
seeping silently through its veins,

02:49.340 --> 02:52.250
and guess what? The dogs.

02:52.300 --> 02:55.690
Whether they're the same ones
who mauled it in the first place

02:55.740 --> 02:58.650
or a whole new pack, they
decide to have another go at it.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.090
And there's enough chemicals
in the sheep by this point

03:01.140 --> 03:03.290
in the pantomime to knock
out half of Huddersfield,

03:03.340 --> 03:06.690
- never mind a handful of feral
mongrels in Ovenden. - Oh, my God.

03:06.740 --> 03:09.370
Anyway, I've had a tip-off by
then about a couple of these lads

03:09.420 --> 03:11.210
who've nicked the sheep
in the first place.

03:11.260 --> 03:13.970
- Have you got no humanity, yeah? Eh?
- You talking to me?

03:14.020 --> 03:17.290
- We just wanted a bit of Sunday
dinner. - It's Wednesday. - For his mam.

03:17.340 --> 03:19.940
She's starting chemo on Monday, you bitch.

03:21.580 --> 03:23.170
Just listen, shit-for-brains.

03:23.220 --> 03:25.450
It was me that had to put
that sheep out of its misery,

03:25.500 --> 03:28.050
- cos of you, so don't talk to me
about no humanity! - Get off me!

03:28.100 --> 03:30.130
'I could have let them
off with a stern word

03:30.180 --> 03:32.490
'and a community resolution,
thus helping Mr Cameron

03:32.540 --> 03:34.610
'and Mrs May massage their crime figures.'

03:34.660 --> 03:37.130
But they scored very
poorly in the attitude test,

03:37.180 --> 03:40.220
and that... was when I smelt this...

03:42.020 --> 03:43.450
Well, I was going to say smell,

03:43.500 --> 03:45.530
but the word don't begin to do it justice.

03:45.580 --> 03:47.210
'It could've been anything.

03:47.260 --> 03:51.700
'Fish, poultry, you name it, but
whatever it was, it was well off.'

Don't play on that PlayStation,

- It's my turn, it's not a game.
- Oh, is he crying? - Piss off.

04:49.340 --> 04:53.370
John, can you tell him not to
turn it on again? And don't swear.

04:53.420 --> 04:56.570
- This won't open.
- You heard what your mother said.

04:56.620 --> 05:00.370
You're not raiding your cupboard,
you, five minutes before your tea.

05:00.420 --> 05:01.930
If he'd come off

05:01.980 --> 05:04.530
when he was supposed to, I
would have had a turn by now.

05:04.580 --> 05:07.450
And it's not just what your mother
says, your dad says it as well.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.570
- It's shit living here.
- What have I just said about swearing?

05:10.620 --> 05:13.690
- Dock his pocket money. - You're just
annoying, you. You don't even exist.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.570
I don't know why you can't take turns.

05:15.620 --> 05:18.650
We used to have a proper system and,
when people stuck to it, it worked.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.250
- We still have.
- It never worked, Mum.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.050
I don't even want any tea.

05:52.020 --> 05:55.650
- What are you doing here? - I've phoned
you 16 times in the last five days.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.570
- I've left messages, I've left...
- You can't come here.

05:58.620 --> 06:02.290
I thought you'd died! I thought
you'd been in an accident.

06:02.340 --> 06:04.090
You know, I don't like doing this, John,

06:04.140 --> 06:06.850
I don't like coming here,
threatening to knock on your door,

06:06.900 --> 06:09.770
but if you don't return calls or
answer messages, what do you expect?

06:09.820 --> 06:12.370
People will read things into
things, people aren't stupid.

06:12.420 --> 06:14.850
Look, work's mad. We're understaffed.

06:14.900 --> 06:17.770
I'm doing 15 people's jobs, I
don't even know what week it is,

06:17.820 --> 06:22.250
- but you can't be here. - I've not
seen you for three weeks, not properly.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.050
And then nothing. Jack shit for five days.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.810
You're overreacting, you're
reading too much into stuff.

06:27.860 --> 06:30.980
- Well, people will. - Who
are these people? - Me!

06:36.780 --> 06:39.740
I should have rung, I should
have texted. I'm sorry.

06:41.660 --> 06:43.650
As long as you're OK.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.330
As long as there's nothing up.

06:45.380 --> 06:48.170
I'm fine, there's nothing, I'm
just snowed under, that's all.

06:48.220 --> 06:51.370
I'll ring you in the morning, all
right? First thing in the morning...

06:51.420 --> 06:55.170
- Well, probably be the afternoon.
- I miss you, that's all.

06:55.220 --> 06:56.780
I love you.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.380
Yeah, I'll ring you.

07:23.140 --> 07:28.130
- Our Catherine had an exciting day
at work. - Did she? - Yeah. She, um...

07:28.180 --> 07:30.300
(found a dead body.)

07:31.460 --> 07:34.490
- What?
- (She found a dead body.)

07:34.540 --> 07:36.970
Well, is that unusual for a copper?

07:37.020 --> 07:39.610
Isn't that the sort of
thing they do every day?

07:39.660 --> 07:42.330
No, not really. Actually find one.

07:42.380 --> 07:46.620
I don't think she's ever
actually found one before.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.890
Except when our Becky died.

07:49.940 --> 07:52.460
Even then, it were Richard
actually found her.

07:55.060 --> 07:57.010
Who was it?

07:57.060 --> 07:59.650
I think it was so badly... (decomposed,)

07:59.700 --> 08:02.060
they couldn't even tell what sex it was.

08:04.140 --> 08:06.370
Have you thought any more about tomorrow?

08:06.420 --> 08:09.370
- I think you're making a mistake.
- We know what you think.

08:09.420 --> 08:12.010
You're starting a new job,
you want your mind on it.

08:12.060 --> 08:14.450
This, the fella who
didn't want me to join up.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.330
Been training for the last 12 weeks,
I just want to get on with it.

08:17.380 --> 08:19.730
Forget everything they
taught you in training school,

08:19.780 --> 08:21.570
because none of it works
in the real world.

08:21.620 --> 08:24.650
Don't call me Catherine in front of
the others, it's Sarge, not Ma'am.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.810
Inspector Taylor is Sir until you
get your feet under the table,

08:27.860 --> 08:29.850
then you can have a crack
at calling him Boss.

08:29.900 --> 08:33.090
You find yourself on the wrong side
of him, he likes sherbet lemons.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.250
Sledge fancies himself
a bit with the ladies,

08:35.299 --> 08:37.850
but if he comes on a bit strong,
try and let him down gently.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.610
And get well in with Joyce, she
knows everybody and everything

08:40.659 --> 08:42.169
and she'll never see you fast.

08:42.220 --> 08:45.090
If you don't understand something,
ask me, ask her, ask anybody,

08:45.140 --> 08:47.930
but if you get an answer you don't
like, don't ask 20 other people,

08:47.980 --> 08:49.050
trust your instincts.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.250
In my book, there's two
instincts, fight or flight.

08:51.300 --> 08:53.890
And I know which one you've got
from the way you refused to leave

08:53.940 --> 08:57.170
that cellar without me 18 months
since, so have faith in yourself.

08:57.220 --> 08:59.730
You've got your smart book,
or your not-so-smart book,

08:59.780 --> 09:02.570
as we fondly refer to them.
Good morning, you lucky people.

09:02.620 --> 09:05.130
Got a new PCSO assigned to us today.

09:05.180 --> 09:07.450
This is Ann Gallagher, some
of you already know her.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.770
I want you to go out of your way
to make her feel welcome. Sit down.

09:10.820 --> 09:12.770
Pairing Ann with you today.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.090
- What about me?
- I've got plans for you.

09:15.140 --> 09:17.250
I'm not really here, I
just wanted to say hello.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.090
Joyce, we met before at her house.

09:19.140 --> 09:22.130
- If you need anything, I'm at
the front desk. - What plans?

09:22.180 --> 09:24.130
Pin your lugholes back
and you'll find out.

09:24.180 --> 09:26.330
I'm loving you and leaving you. Oh!

09:26.380 --> 09:30.530
- Oh, there's always one! Good
afternoon, Mr Tekele. - Sorry, Sarge.

09:30.580 --> 09:32.090
Baby's teething.

09:32.140 --> 09:35.330
First up, you'll have noticed there
is nowhere to park this morning,

09:35.380 --> 09:37.650
- cos we've got HMIT
in the building. - Oooh!

09:37.700 --> 09:40.970
That's due to this body that was
found, that I found yesterday.

09:41.020 --> 09:43.770
So your deployment possibly
today, possibly tomorrow,

09:43.820 --> 09:45.970
possibly all week, is
likely to be disrupted,

09:46.020 --> 09:48.770
cos chances are we'll be asked
to join OSU in the house-to-house.

09:48.820 --> 09:51.500
Loving your enthusiasm.

09:53.740 --> 09:56.650
So, today, CCTV is a priority.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.690
Local authority cameras

09:58.740 --> 10:02.050
and any private security
cameras in the immediate area.

10:02.100 --> 10:05.410
I want house-to-house, concentrating
first of all on any flats,

10:05.460 --> 10:08.730
any houses overlooking the garage
where the body was discovered.

10:08.780 --> 10:11.490
John, are you using divine
inspiration over there,

10:11.540 --> 10:14.490
- or are you going to start
taking notes? - Sorry.

10:14.540 --> 10:16.770
Right, we've got an ident on the DNA.

10:16.820 --> 10:20.850
The victim is a Lynn Dewhurst,
45 years old, address,

10:20.900 --> 10:23.490
10 Bateman Street, King Cross.

10:23.540 --> 10:27.490
Convictions for soliciting,
shoplifting and benefit fraud.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.850
Mike, can we get your team
over to that address now?

10:29.900 --> 10:33.330
- Get it secured, then I'll get a
search team in there. - Lynn Dewhurst?

10:33.380 --> 10:35.300
You know who that is, don't you?

10:37.540 --> 10:38.980
Oh, my God.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.210
Morning.

10:44.260 --> 10:45.650
Hiya.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.730
- Morning. - Morning. - Hi.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.490
- Morning.
- Morning.

10:49.540 --> 10:51.890
- That body you found yesterday.
- Yeah?

10:51.940 --> 10:54.340
It's Tommy Lee Royce's mother.

10:56.620 --> 10:58.290
No way.

10:58.340 --> 11:01.490
Somebody from HMIT will want to go
through your first account with you

11:01.540 --> 11:03.370
in a bit more detail at some point today.

11:03.420 --> 11:07.300
- You should make it clear to them
then that you knew her. - Yeah.

11:13.820 --> 11:16.530
How long had she been dead, do they know?

11:16.580 --> 11:18.290
Last sighted five or six weeks since.

11:18.340 --> 11:19.690
Time of death, at the moment,

11:19.740 --> 11:22.850
they can't be any more specific than
between three and five weeks ago.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.940
Getting a search team to her house
now, see what that throws up.

11:40.020 --> 11:42.570
'OK, folks. I'm inside.

11:42.620 --> 11:46.050
'Inside a big dirty stinking
teapot, it feels like.

11:46.100 --> 11:51.410
'Look at this place, Lily! Oh!
It's so dark and depressive.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.850
'How do you manage?

11:53.900 --> 11:56.170
'Well, when we first moved
in, this was the first room

11:56.220 --> 11:58.730
'we were going to do, but
it's just not happened...'

12:03.060 --> 12:05.810
'.. you've heard it before.
The smell of fresh coffee...'

12:10.060 --> 12:11.580
Tommy.

12:13.220 --> 12:14.460
Don't stand up.

12:16.300 --> 12:19.690
'.. anybody in? Sorry, that was
a bad joke because he's gone.

12:19.740 --> 12:23.410
'But before he went, he did do
this rather nice bathroom, Lily?

12:23.460 --> 12:25.490
'Yeah, we're delighted with this...'

12:25.540 --> 12:27.650
What are you watching?

12:27.700 --> 12:29.300
Just...

12:31.180 --> 12:32.900
Just crap.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.820
Is it all right if I, um...

12:42.140 --> 12:43.780
.. sit down?

12:47.300 --> 12:50.810
'I like this, and I
loathe it. What is that?'

12:50.860 --> 12:53.090
Can I turn the sound down?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.810
'I like it, because I like this fireplace.

12:55.860 --> 12:58.500
'Something sort of Jane Austen about...'

13:05.620 --> 13:07.090
You're looking troubled.

13:07.140 --> 13:08.420
OK.

13:10.860 --> 13:12.500
So...

13:17.260 --> 13:21.010
Yesterday afternoon, the body of a
woman was found in a refuse area

13:21.060 --> 13:24.180
next to some flats in North Halifax.

13:25.980 --> 13:29.460
She'd been strangled and she'd
been sexually assaulted.

13:33.100 --> 13:35.020
And what's it got to do with me?

13:37.380 --> 13:38.660
Um...

13:39.820 --> 13:44.340
A DNA swab taken at the postmortem
has indicated that the dead woman...

13:48.060 --> 13:49.500
.. is your mum.

14:00.500 --> 14:04.690
So, some detectives are going
to come and speak to you...

14:04.740 --> 14:06.810
You're lying, you're lying.

14:06.860 --> 14:09.980
I'm sorry. I wish I was.

14:12.780 --> 14:18.650
Some detectives are going to come
and talk to you later in the day.

14:18.700 --> 14:23.250
- And in the meantime...
- But... why...?

14:23.300 --> 14:28.900
They'll ask you some
questions. About her, I assume.

14:30.540 --> 14:33.770
Her lifestyle, people she spent time with,

14:33.820 --> 14:37.610
anybody she owed money to,
anybody she didn't get on with.

14:37.660 --> 14:41.570
Anything that might indicate who
would do something like this to her.

14:41.620 --> 14:44.300
Anything you can tell
them that might help.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.050
And in the meantime,

14:52.100 --> 14:55.060
if you need to talk to someone...

14:57.700 --> 14:59.410
.. that's what I'm here for.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.380
And you know where I am.

15:13.860 --> 15:15.540
Are you all right?

15:25.740 --> 15:29.970
You know, phone call. It's just
manners, is all I'm saying.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.700
Yeah, and you.

15:38.460 --> 15:40.330
Clare?

15:40.380 --> 15:45.330
- It's me, Neil Ackroyd. We went
to Selby Bridge together. - Neil!

15:45.380 --> 15:47.170
How are you?

15:47.220 --> 15:50.730
Oh... How are you?

15:50.780 --> 15:52.140
Not so bad.

15:53.980 --> 15:56.650
Well, except I asked after a
job in here two weeks since

15:56.700 --> 15:58.170
and he's never got back to me.

15:58.220 --> 16:00.410
Hopeless. He doesn't know which way is up,

16:00.460 --> 16:04.050
he couldn't organise a proverbial
piss-up. I'd look elsewhere.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.410
Yeah, I'd have to, now.

16:06.460 --> 16:10.370
God, you know, I'd have
walked past and not known you.

16:10.420 --> 16:15.250
- How you keeping? - Oh, you
know. - Do you live round here?

16:15.300 --> 16:17.530
Yeah, I've got a little
flat in Rawson Lane.

16:17.580 --> 16:19.570
Not been there long, just a few months.

16:19.620 --> 16:23.490
- Cos didn't you live up Queensbury?
- Yeah, got divorced. - Oh, I'm sorry.

16:23.540 --> 16:27.330
- Yeah, yeah. Still, what
about you, you married? - No.

16:27.380 --> 16:32.170
No, er... I've had a few... entanglements.

16:32.220 --> 16:36.730
But no, I live with me sister, our
Catherine. Remember our Catherine?

16:36.780 --> 16:40.410
- I remember your Catherine.
- Two years above us.

16:40.460 --> 16:44.460
- I was always terrified of her.
- Yeah, I know what you mean!

16:46.860 --> 16:49.610
I thought you worked
for t'building society?

16:49.660 --> 16:52.300
Yeah, yeah, I did for years, but, er...

16:53.540 --> 16:55.450
I had a bit of a difficult patch,

16:55.500 --> 16:58.930
- all to do with the divorce,
one way or another. - Blimey.

16:58.980 --> 17:00.970
Yeah, yeah. Still.

17:01.020 --> 17:06.050
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's smashing bumping into you.

17:06.099 --> 17:08.700
- I've often thought about
you. - Have you? - Yeah.

17:10.099 --> 17:12.380
Occasionally wondered what you were up to.

17:15.660 --> 17:20.970
We're on Hangingroyd Street,
me and our Catherine, number 29.

17:21.020 --> 17:24.130
If you're ever at a loose end
and you fancy a cup of tea.

17:24.180 --> 17:27.450
- I'm working a while, but I could
pop my head in then? - Today?

17:27.500 --> 17:33.690
- Oh... Obviously not if you're busy.
- No, no, that'd be lovely.

17:33.740 --> 17:35.180
Right.

17:37.460 --> 17:39.540
I'd best get back.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.730
OK, great, thanks very much. Cheers.

17:53.780 --> 17:57.050
How long have you been
doing the job, then?

17:57.100 --> 17:59.770
It's my first day. You've
asked me that three times now.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.650
- Yeah, hi.
- John?

18:09.700 --> 18:13.410
Can I ring you back? I'm right
in the middle of something.

18:13.460 --> 18:17.530
- I will ring you back, I just need
a couple of minutes. - Right, well...

18:17.580 --> 18:21.450
- Make sure you do.
- I will, I will. Two minutes, all right?

18:21.500 --> 18:24.380
- OK, bye-bye.
- Bye.

18:30.780 --> 18:32.060
Cup of tea?

18:35.420 --> 18:38.370
'Bravo November 1, to
all officers on guard.

18:38.420 --> 18:41.010
'Just be aware that the SIO,
Mr Shepherd, is coming up

18:41.060 --> 18:44.330
'to your location with a member from
the press office. Bravo November 1.'

18:44.380 --> 18:47.060
So, what have you learnt so
far, then? Anything exciting?

18:52.180 --> 18:54.530
- I think he's having an affair.
- Probably.

18:54.580 --> 18:58.460
- His mind's not on the job.
- CID, they're all tossers.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.850
Why do we not like doing
house-to-house, us wooden-tops?

19:03.900 --> 19:06.210
Why did they all groan
when she announced it?

19:06.260 --> 19:09.810
Because... when do they come and
help us out with our workload, eh?

19:09.860 --> 19:13.850
They don't. They think we're just
there to support them and we're not.

19:13.900 --> 19:19.010
They sit on their fat arses all
day, bending paperclips. It's true.

19:19.060 --> 19:20.690
Same rank as us, same pay as us,

19:20.740 --> 19:23.250
we do all the work,
they get all the glory.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.850
Just remember who caught
the Ripper. Two uniforms.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.770
And you're not a wooden-top, by the way.

19:29.820 --> 19:33.580
- I'm a wooden-top, you're a
plastic police officer. - Oh.

19:34.980 --> 19:36.340
OK.

19:46.340 --> 19:48.730
- 'Hello?'
- Hi, sorry, it's me.

19:48.780 --> 19:53.370
- It's wall-to-wall, honestly, I've
not had two minutes to myself. - OK.

19:53.420 --> 19:55.020
So, um...

19:57.100 --> 20:01.420
Look, this isn't why I haven't rung.

20:03.620 --> 20:06.610
I just think this isn't
really what either of us

20:06.660 --> 20:10.770
thought it was going
to be when it started.

20:10.820 --> 20:13.490
I knew sommat was up.

20:13.540 --> 20:16.300
'I don't want to do this any more.'

20:18.260 --> 20:19.930
Vicky?

20:19.980 --> 20:22.690
I kind of got that, I think,
over the last few days.

20:22.740 --> 20:24.210
The penny's been dropping.

20:24.260 --> 20:26.770
- I'm sorry.
- 'Yeah, well...'

20:26.820 --> 20:28.850
So am I.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.620
'Are you OK?'

20:32.340 --> 20:33.700
Mmm.

20:34.980 --> 20:38.770
- OK, well... - I've still got
some of your things. - What things?

20:38.820 --> 20:42.210
Bits, things that you left.
I've got your warrant card.

20:42.260 --> 20:45.930
'That one you lost, I found it
under the bed a few days ago.'

20:45.980 --> 20:48.530
- Do you want it back?
- Yeah, yeah... Yeah, yeah.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.610
- Right, well, do you want to come
and fetch it? - What, to your flat?

20:51.660 --> 20:56.170
Actually, perhaps it would better
to meet on neutral ground, in a pub.

20:56.220 --> 21:00.330
- Somewhere. - Yeah,
yeah. - This evening.

21:00.380 --> 21:03.530
I'll be up at Wheels at seven o'clock.

21:03.580 --> 21:04.930
I don't if I can do this evening,

21:04.980 --> 21:06.650
depends what time the boss lets us go.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.010
'If you're not there, I shan't wait.'

21:09.060 --> 21:10.940
Wh...

21:32.540 --> 21:34.650
I thought about this long
and hard, and I'm sorry,

21:34.700 --> 21:36.730
but the upshot is I'm going
to have to let you go.

21:36.780 --> 21:39.730
I've given you the benefit of the
doubt time and again and now this.

21:39.780 --> 21:41.330
I've just spent an hour apologising.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.970
It was them that started off
being rude and swearing, not me!

21:44.020 --> 21:46.810
It's their wall! You churned up the
garden with a seven tonne truck!

21:46.860 --> 21:49.690
Do you expect them to come
out and say thank you?!

21:49.740 --> 21:52.450
You know, just a bit of humility,

21:52.500 --> 21:56.290
when you've done sommat like
that, is all that's required.

21:56.340 --> 21:58.530
They're ordinary people,
they're nice people.

21:58.580 --> 22:02.170
They just wanted someone to say
sorry. Are you even listening to me?

22:02.220 --> 22:07.220
Fine, fine. Pop into accounts,
get your P45 off Janice. Go on.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.580
Go on.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.460
How's Mrs Gallagher?

22:31.460 --> 22:33.250
She's...

22:43.740 --> 22:47.060
- Did you recognise her?
- At the scene? No.

22:49.020 --> 22:52.730
Face was gone, it could have
been a lad for all I knew.

22:52.780 --> 22:54.530
Soon as I realised what I was looking at,

22:54.580 --> 22:56.010
I got out of there and secured it.

22:56.060 --> 22:58.820
But you did know Lynn Dewhurst?

23:00.900 --> 23:02.420
Yeah, I knew Lynn.

23:03.980 --> 23:06.260
Yeah, she was Tommy Lee Royce's mother.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.540
What contact had you
had with her? Recently?

23:17.340 --> 23:19.330
OK, well, I had had reason recently

23:19.380 --> 23:21.780
to warn her to keep away from my grandson.

23:23.660 --> 23:26.170
Becky, my daughter...

23:26.220 --> 23:29.090
She's dead, she died, took her own life.

23:29.140 --> 23:32.300
Well, Tommy Lee Royce was...

23:35.260 --> 23:38.650
He weren't the father, he raped
her, he raped my daughter.

23:38.700 --> 23:41.300
Weren't convicted for it,
but that's what happens, so.

23:42.700 --> 23:45.410
Anyway, Lynn found this
out about 18 months ago,

23:45.460 --> 23:48.020
that Royce was Ryan's biological...

23:51.620 --> 23:53.770
And four, five, six weeks
ago, down in Hebden,

23:53.820 --> 23:57.610
Ryan came home saying that he'd
met this woman, this drunk woman,

23:57.660 --> 24:01.490
outside the shops, telling him
that she was his grandmother.

24:01.540 --> 24:05.090
She didn't do anything, but the point was,

24:05.140 --> 24:09.810
there's a court order against
Royce making any contact with Ryan

24:09.860 --> 24:13.090
whatsoever, either directly or indirectly.

24:13.140 --> 24:16.210
So I knocked on at her address with
the intention of warning her off,

24:16.260 --> 24:17.690
but she weren't in.

24:17.740 --> 24:19.970
Or she weren't opening the door.

24:20.020 --> 24:23.650
So, I left a couple of messages
on her answering machine,

24:23.700 --> 24:26.250
messages which may have
sounded threatening,

24:26.300 --> 24:29.060
and which I assume you've got hold of.

24:30.340 --> 24:32.730
Which is, I assume, why we're here.

24:32.780 --> 24:35.490
What did you say in these messages?

24:35.540 --> 24:38.210
Warned her to keep away from him, I said,

24:38.260 --> 24:40.730
if she didn't stay away from
him, she'd regret it. I said,

24:40.780 --> 24:43.770
if she came anywhere near our Ryan
again, there'd be consequences,

24:43.820 --> 24:46.250
which there would be, as I
say, there's a court order.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.450
And did you see Lynn again subsequently

24:48.500 --> 24:50.250
after you left these messages?

24:50.300 --> 24:51.730
No.

24:51.780 --> 24:53.410
Which phone did you ring her on?

24:53.460 --> 24:56.970
My landline at home. It's blocked.

24:57.020 --> 25:01.260
- When, exactly, did you leave these messages?
- When this happened.

25:02.820 --> 25:05.980
- Four, five, six weeks ago.
- Can you be any more specific?

25:12.180 --> 25:13.930
It was a Wednesday when she spoke to him,

25:13.980 --> 25:16.530
cos he was late and he has
football after school on Wednesday,

25:16.580 --> 25:19.140
so I knocked on her door the
next day... I'd been to Bradford.

25:21.340 --> 25:22.620
I'd been...

25:25.620 --> 25:28.690
.. to a child sexual
exploitation seminar in Bradford.

25:28.740 --> 25:31.130
I was on my way back and I
was passing, so I knocked.

25:31.180 --> 25:34.290
There you go, Thursday 14th July.

25:34.340 --> 25:39.490
And then, um... I rang her not
long after, about 5:30-ish,

25:39.540 --> 25:44.540
and then, again, about an hour later.

25:49.500 --> 25:53.930
- Can you remember why you left two messages?
- To get the message across.

25:53.980 --> 25:57.210
You could never be certain it had
gone to the top floor with Lynn.

25:57.260 --> 26:00.060
Her brain was so addled
with crap, and, and... And...

26:03.700 --> 26:05.370
I don't know, I suppose I was hoping

26:05.420 --> 26:07.700
she might pick up the
phone the second time.

26:09.380 --> 26:11.450
You had no subsequent contact with her?

26:11.500 --> 26:13.500
You've already asked me that, Ma'am.

26:15.020 --> 26:17.100
No, there was no subsequent contact.

26:20.420 --> 26:21.780
OK.

26:24.900 --> 26:30.170
Look, Catherine. You used to work
in HMIT, you know the procedure.

26:30.220 --> 26:33.530
You left threatening messages
on her answering machine,

26:33.580 --> 26:37.770
and you found the body, so we
have to eliminate you, that's all.

26:37.820 --> 26:40.130
At the minute, we're
looking at a two-week period

26:40.180 --> 26:42.730
when the pathologist believes
Lynn's death occurred

26:42.780 --> 26:45.250
and he won't commit himself
to being any more specific

26:45.300 --> 26:47.090
given the condition her body was in.

26:47.140 --> 26:51.730
So, what I need you to do is to go away

26:51.780 --> 26:54.090
and look at your smartphone,

26:54.140 --> 26:58.530
your diary, your pocketbook,
look at your work roster.

26:58.580 --> 26:59.890
Check your calendar at home

26:59.940 --> 27:03.410
and get back to us with
as accurate an account,

27:03.460 --> 27:05.490
a chronological account,

27:05.540 --> 27:11.740
of what you were doing Saturday
23rd July to Saturday 6th August.

27:14.860 --> 27:16.660
You're not a suspect.

27:18.380 --> 27:20.660
Everyone was a suspect when I was in HMIT.

27:30.860 --> 27:32.580
Thanks for your time, Catherine.

27:41.820 --> 27:44.330
One flat we went in, there
were dog turds on the floor.

27:44.380 --> 27:45.610
On the carpet, no bowl,

27:45.660 --> 27:48.850
they must pour the dog food straight
out of the can onto the floor.

27:48.900 --> 27:51.850
Yeah, and they're the responsible ones.

27:51.900 --> 27:54.650
They're the ones that
actually feed their pets.

27:54.700 --> 27:58.450
99.9% of your time, that's the sort
of people you'll be dealing with.

27:58.500 --> 28:01.570
People who live in houses where
you have to wipe your feet

28:01.620 --> 28:04.330
- when you leave. You better
get used to it. - Oh, God.

28:04.380 --> 28:06.770
You know what this detective
I got paired off with said?

28:06.820 --> 28:08.610
The one that had his
mind on higher things?

28:08.660 --> 28:13.690
Apparently, Lynn Dewhurst, he hadn't
just strangled her, whoever did it.

28:13.740 --> 28:17.530
He'd raped her with a bottle,
a broken bottle, like.

28:17.580 --> 28:19.610
Mutilated her.

28:19.660 --> 28:21.060
Internally.

28:25.220 --> 28:26.900
Why do you assume it's a man?

28:28.100 --> 28:30.010
It's not as uncommon as you might imagine.

28:30.060 --> 28:33.330
It don't leave any DNA,
a bottle, and you know...

28:33.380 --> 28:35.810
Rape isn't about sex, it's about power.

28:35.860 --> 28:37.610
And it usually is a man, to be fair,

28:37.660 --> 28:40.050
in case I just put the
wrong idea in your head.

28:40.100 --> 28:44.420
There's some sick little bastards
out there. But you know that.

28:45.980 --> 28:47.620
See you tomorrow.

29:07.180 --> 29:10.450
Owen's at sixth form, he's
over at Huddersfield College.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.770
He's doing reasonably well,

29:11.820 --> 29:14.610
he certainly seems engaged
with it all, anyway.

29:14.660 --> 29:16.970
Samantha's in the middle of her GCSEs.

29:17.020 --> 29:20.410
I think she's more interested
in lads, between you and me,

29:20.460 --> 29:23.490
- but, you know, we live in hope.
- How often do you see 'em?

29:23.540 --> 29:25.450
Every other weekend, technically.

29:25.500 --> 29:28.170
I suppose they get to that age
and they want to suit themselves,

29:28.220 --> 29:31.410
- don't they? I know I did.
- Yeah, you were a rebel.

29:31.460 --> 29:34.250
Er, well, sort of.

29:34.300 --> 29:37.250
I tried to be. It were tricky.

29:37.300 --> 29:38.820
Me and our Catherine.

29:40.020 --> 29:44.570
I don't know if you knew this,
but us Dad died when we were tiny,

29:44.620 --> 29:49.570
and then us Mum died when I
were 13, Catherine were 15, so...

29:49.620 --> 29:52.530
It's always been Catherine I've
turned to if I've needed anything,

29:52.580 --> 29:54.250
she's always looked out for me.

29:54.300 --> 29:56.250
We have our ups and our
downs, but she's a rock.

29:56.300 --> 29:57.650
If I have to tell you one more time

29:57.700 --> 30:00.250
about taking that bike to bits
on the pavement, I'll do things

30:00.300 --> 30:02.610
with those spark plugs that'd
bring tears to your eyes.

30:02.660 --> 30:05.610
Is there anything I said
you're struggling with?! Good.

30:05.660 --> 30:07.490
Hey up!

30:07.540 --> 30:11.010
- Catherine. - Idiot... - Do
you remember Neil Ackroyd?

30:11.060 --> 30:13.210
- We were at school together.
- Hiya.

30:13.260 --> 30:17.090
- Hi. - Got that bike in bits again all
over t'pavement, next door but one.

30:17.140 --> 30:19.010
We bumped into each other in Hebden,

30:19.060 --> 30:21.410
we've not seen each
other since fifth form.

30:21.460 --> 30:23.020
Oh, very good.

30:25.540 --> 30:28.690
You see? I've told him about not
kicking it against Winnie's wall.

30:28.740 --> 30:29.730
Ryan!

30:29.780 --> 30:32.650
What have I said about not kicking
your ball against Winnie's wall?

30:32.700 --> 30:35.020
- I'd best get off.
- Yeah.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.370
- Well, it's been lovely
to see you. - Yeah.

30:39.420 --> 30:42.290
If you can remember to put my name
down on that list for an allotment,

30:42.340 --> 30:44.250
- I'd love that.
- Oh, I will, definitely, yeah.

30:44.300 --> 30:47.210
I'll get us tickets for Cinema
Paradiso, it's this Sunday,

30:47.260 --> 30:49.570
- just around t'corner.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

30:49.620 --> 30:53.170
- Catherine, Neil's going.
- Bye.

30:53.220 --> 30:56.220
Bye! Right, bye.

31:22.020 --> 31:23.850
What's up? Catherine?

31:23.900 --> 31:28.340
- I'm all right. I'm just...
- What?

31:33.780 --> 31:35.380
What do I have to do?

31:36.780 --> 31:39.770
I've got the Queen's
police medal for bravery,

31:39.820 --> 31:42.970
I've been to Buckingham Palace
and I've shook the woman's hand.

31:43.020 --> 31:44.650
And now they're accusing me

31:44.700 --> 31:47.170
- of strangling and bottling
Lynn Dewhurst. - Who are?

31:47.220 --> 31:48.610
Bottling?!

31:48.660 --> 31:53.930
This DI Jodie Shackleton. She's about 15.

31:53.980 --> 31:57.610
- She's David Shackleton's
daughter. - Who? - Chief Con.

31:57.660 --> 31:59.770
Guess how she shinned her
way up the greasy pole.

31:59.820 --> 32:02.530
Hang on, what's that got
to do with Lynn Dewhurst?

32:02.580 --> 32:06.010
It was her. That body I found.

32:06.060 --> 32:09.210
And they're not accusing me,
they're trying to eliminate me,

32:09.260 --> 32:13.420
- but you can see her thinking things
with her little brain. - Why? Why you?

32:15.420 --> 32:17.610
I found the body,

32:17.660 --> 32:21.730
I left threatening messages on her
answering machine, I had a motive.

32:21.780 --> 32:24.660
But you didn't, did you? Did you?

32:26.180 --> 32:30.290
- Are you seriously asking me that, Clare?!
- Sorry, no. I were... No.

32:30.340 --> 32:34.650
- She's just doing her job.
- Yeah, but bloody hell.

32:34.700 --> 32:37.490
No, it's routine, it's procedure.

32:37.540 --> 32:41.900
- Bitch. - It's just not much fun
being on the wrong end of it.

32:46.540 --> 32:48.900
- Lynn Dewhurst.
- I know.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.700
I once snogged him.

32:58.620 --> 33:03.330
- Sorry?
- Neil. After a disco at school.

33:03.380 --> 33:06.820
Down at t'bus stop in Selby
Bridge. I always liked him.

33:11.260 --> 33:13.500
Shall we get a takeaway tonight?

33:48.220 --> 33:51.020
- I thought I was
going to be late. - No.

33:52.220 --> 33:54.980
- Is that...? - Only
if you want it. - Yeah.

34:03.540 --> 34:07.770
I'm sorry for... I don't
want you to think that...

34:07.820 --> 34:13.260
You know, when it started, I did
mean all those things. I just...

34:15.300 --> 34:19.409
Well, you must feel the same.
It wasn't, it just hasn't...

34:19.460 --> 34:22.530
- Lived up to its early promise.
- .. become what I thought it would.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.170
Well, yeah, if you like.

34:24.219 --> 34:28.650
Well, that's not how I feel, John.

34:28.699 --> 34:33.370
For the record, I'm...
Well, I'm disappointed.

34:33.420 --> 34:38.409
You couldn't wait to get away from
her. I thought you were sick of her.

34:38.460 --> 34:41.810
And all I've got to comfort
myself with now is the idea that

34:41.860 --> 34:44.370
two years with me and all
it's done is make you realise

34:44.420 --> 34:47.500
- she's just not that bad.
- It's not just...

34:49.500 --> 34:52.130
You know, it's complicated.

34:52.179 --> 34:55.370
With the kids, you know, three kids.

34:55.420 --> 34:58.740
It doesn't get any easier.
Just gets more and more...

35:05.860 --> 35:08.010
We've had some good times.

35:08.060 --> 35:09.220
Haven't we?

35:11.180 --> 35:14.490
How do you know I'm not going
to make life difficult for you?

35:14.540 --> 35:16.660
- Are you?
- Why shouldn't I?

35:26.220 --> 35:28.940
- Did you bring those things?
- Mmm.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.780
Thank you.

36:00.740 --> 36:04.780
- We can still be friends.
- Sure. - Can't we? - Sure.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.100
Hello, love.

36:41.180 --> 36:43.060
Can I stop here for a bit?

36:48.260 --> 36:51.140
Um... Yeah, course you can.

36:53.580 --> 36:56.050
- What's happened?
- She's chucked me out.

36:56.100 --> 36:59.130
Lucy, why? When did this happen?

36:59.180 --> 37:01.250
Last week.

37:01.300 --> 37:04.130
I've been at my dad's,
only Rose got sick of me,

37:04.180 --> 37:06.130
which was entirely mutual.

37:06.180 --> 37:09.050
Then I've been at a bed-and-breakfast,

37:09.100 --> 37:11.500
but that's just made me
feel even more shit, so.

37:13.060 --> 37:15.540
You're going to have
to sleep on the settee.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.450
- That's fine.
- Is it?

37:18.500 --> 37:19.890
How permanent?

37:19.940 --> 37:21.690
She reckons she wants a divorce.

37:21.740 --> 37:25.010
She won't talk to me. I
keep knocking on the door.

37:25.060 --> 37:28.580
Her dad's changed the
locks. That's my house!

37:30.740 --> 37:34.610
- And he's been on the phone
making threats. - Well, why?

37:34.660 --> 37:37.610
- What's happened?
- Nothing's happened!

37:37.660 --> 37:42.140
- She's just got stupid ideas in her
head, that's all. - About what? - Me.

37:43.580 --> 37:47.900
Ever since Daisy were born, she's
been off her... flaming trolley.

37:49.140 --> 37:53.170
- And now, she's just gone
completely fruit loop. - What's up?

37:53.220 --> 37:58.050
Daniel's going to be sleeping on
the settee for a couple of nights.

37:58.100 --> 38:01.300
- Hiya.
- Hiya.

38:06.460 --> 38:07.940
Do you want another one?

38:10.740 --> 38:12.020
No.

38:13.220 --> 38:14.740
No...

38:17.980 --> 38:20.410
No, I ought to be getting off home.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.340
You all right, John?

38:24.860 --> 38:27.340
Oh... Oh!

38:29.220 --> 38:31.260
Probably coming down with flu.

38:37.100 --> 38:40.980
- Whoops! OK. - Oh... - OK?

38:44.260 --> 38:49.570
Oh, God. Maybe it's because
I've not eaten anything all day.

38:49.620 --> 38:53.740
- And then the beer.
- Let's get you in the car.

38:54.740 --> 38:58.410
- What's wrong with me? - Let's get you
in the car. - Am I having a stroke?

38:58.460 --> 39:00.770
No, no.

39:00.820 --> 39:02.890
Let's just get you into your car.

39:02.940 --> 39:04.810
Oh, God, I don't think...

39:04.860 --> 39:09.290
- Oh... I don't think I can drive.
- I can drive.

39:09.340 --> 39:12.530
- What's happening to me?
- Just...

39:12.580 --> 39:15.010
Where's your keys?

39:15.060 --> 39:17.100
- Whoa...
- Whoa! OK.

41:05.900 --> 41:08.900
- Morning. Want to...?
- No, no, please.

41:13.820 --> 41:15.610
Following the meeting I had yesterday

41:15.660 --> 41:17.050
with the Assistant Chief Con

41:17.100 --> 41:19.170
and the SIOs in the
other two investigations,

41:19.220 --> 41:23.050
it's been concluded that there
is sufficient evidence, well...

41:23.100 --> 41:26.050
more than sufficient evidence,
to link this operation

41:26.100 --> 41:29.650
with Operation Sycamore
and Operation Livingston.

41:29.700 --> 41:31.010
The upshot, therefore,

41:31.060 --> 41:34.090
is that we are now looking
at a serial offender.

41:34.140 --> 41:36.490
What that means in practical terms

41:36.540 --> 41:39.130
is that we're merging this
investigation with the two teams

41:39.180 --> 41:42.090
looking at the two other murders
and the investigation as a whole

41:42.140 --> 41:44.050
will now be upgraded to Cat A...

41:44.100 --> 41:47.940
You need to be listening. Not talking.

42:01.860 --> 42:03.730
'Ladies and gentlemen,

42:03.780 --> 42:08.850
'this is London King's Cross,
where this service terminates.

42:08.900 --> 42:12.540
'Please make sure you take all your
personal items with you. Thank you.'

42:58.460 --> 43:00.970
I can't believe you they
told you something like that

43:01.020 --> 43:02.540
in such a matter-of-fact way.

43:05.620 --> 43:08.370
How else are they going to do it in here?

43:08.420 --> 43:09.860
It's appalling.

43:11.220 --> 43:13.700
I know she was what she was, but...

43:15.980 --> 43:19.340
- Well, it's still your mother, in't it?
- Yeah. Of course it is.

43:27.340 --> 43:32.660
I've got this... this idea, in me head.

43:34.940 --> 43:37.460
- Oh, it's bugging me.
- What?

43:41.740 --> 43:43.980
That fucking bitch!

43:47.060 --> 43:49.260
Cawood.

43:52.220 --> 43:53.780
What about her?

43:55.340 --> 43:59.130
They came in to talk to me,
yesterday afternoon, these police.

43:59.180 --> 44:04.860
She'd been dead five, six, seven
weeks, Mum, they're not sure.

44:07.100 --> 44:11.180
Cawood rang my mum up, making threats.

44:13.060 --> 44:16.380
She told me, my mum did, I
spoke to her, she were crying.

44:17.660 --> 44:21.290
She'd seen Ryan outside t'shop
down Hebden, and she spoke to him,

44:21.340 --> 44:23.450
she said, "I'm your granny."

44:23.500 --> 44:25.530
That's all she said, "I'm your granny,"

44:25.580 --> 44:28.410
and then Cawood's ringing
her up making threats.

44:28.460 --> 44:29.850
I remember, you told me.

44:29.900 --> 44:34.370
Yeah, well, there you go, then
she turns up dead, strangled.

44:34.420 --> 44:36.500
Mashed up inside with broken glass.

44:39.980 --> 44:41.980
You see, she's clever, this bitch.

44:43.420 --> 44:46.170
She's do something like
that so everyone would go,

44:46.220 --> 44:50.010
"Well, a woman'd never do something
like that to another woman."

44:50.060 --> 44:53.140
You see, I know how a
bitch like that thinks.

44:55.300 --> 44:57.730
I said to them, I said, "Are
you even questioning her?"

44:57.780 --> 45:00.890
- What did they say?
- Oh...

45:00.940 --> 45:03.210
"All lines of inquiry are being pursued."

45:03.260 --> 45:04.700
Bollocks.

45:06.700 --> 45:10.820
They'll hide it, if it is
her. They will cover it up.

45:12.340 --> 45:13.700
She's untouchable.

45:18.340 --> 45:20.060
She's...

45:21.700 --> 45:23.340
She's...

45:26.660 --> 45:30.810
She's ruined my life, and she's...

45:30.860 --> 45:34.380
She's untouchable.

45:39.460 --> 45:41.180
I love you.

45:51.260 --> 45:52.660
I know you do.

45:58.260 --> 45:59.940
(It's OK.)

46:02.300 --> 46:04.460
(Tommy, it's OK.)

46:18.780 --> 46:22.450
- You wanted to see me?
- It's a serial killer, it's official.

46:22.500 --> 46:25.850
- Oh, so I take it I'm off the hook?
- Ah. - You're joking. - The thing is...

46:25.900 --> 46:29.730
- Tell me you're joking. - They've got specific
times of death on the other two operations.

46:29.780 --> 46:32.210
So, if you can alibi yourself
for those, you're laughing.

46:32.260 --> 46:34.730
I'm really seriously not
even thinking about laughing.

46:34.780 --> 46:37.810
- It's routine, it's procedure.
- It's wank, it's toss.

46:37.860 --> 46:40.810
- You want the dates and times? - No.
- Shall I e-mail them to you? - No.

46:40.860 --> 46:44.780
Walking away won't make it go away.
Catherine, where are you going?

46:47.460 --> 46:49.450
I'm going to strangle
a few more prostitutes

46:49.500 --> 46:52.210
and stick some more broken
bottles where the sun don't shine.

46:52.260 --> 46:55.330
- You know that's not funny. Even
in fun, that's not funny. - Really?

46:55.380 --> 46:59.210
- I thought it was hilarious!
- Catherine, just tick the boxes!

46:59.260 --> 47:03.050
Has anyone thought to go and talk
to the girls on Stonyroyd Lane?

47:03.100 --> 47:04.770
Warn them to watch out for each other,

47:04.820 --> 47:06.970
not to go with anybody
they don't know, etc, etc?

47:07.020 --> 47:10.930
Yeah, no, not yet, but we
will do that, obviously.

47:10.980 --> 47:12.650
I'm going to e-mail you those dates.

47:12.700 --> 47:15.410
Yeah, good luck with that, sir.

47:15.460 --> 47:17.500
Cather... Sarge, it's Joyce.

47:20.260 --> 47:23.900
- Joyce? - There's a lady
down here, Alison Garrs.

47:25.540 --> 47:28.610
She says she's the one whose
sheep you put out of its misery

47:28.660 --> 47:30.180
the day before yesterday.

47:33.500 --> 47:34.700
She's coming.

47:39.140 --> 47:40.300
Morning.

47:41.420 --> 47:43.770
Look what they've done to Daryl.

47:43.820 --> 47:47.370
This is them lads that you
let off with a caution.

47:47.420 --> 47:49.810
He went into the shop down Havenden,

47:49.860 --> 47:52.130
they started pushing him around.

47:52.180 --> 47:53.780
Making sheep noises at him.

47:55.380 --> 47:57.610
Ask Dave to come down
and take a statement.

47:57.660 --> 48:00.090
I want a crime done for a section 39.

48:00.140 --> 48:01.690
Come on through.

48:01.740 --> 48:04.940
Come on, lad, we don't bite, I'm
going to nip this in the bud.

48:13.700 --> 48:15.650
Come on.

48:15.700 --> 48:17.100
Go on.

48:38.460 --> 48:44.020
Hello, ladies. Hiya, Nat. How's things?

48:45.780 --> 48:47.500
How are you getting on at Lifeline?

48:49.860 --> 48:53.690
- I don't like going. - She don't
like going. - It's full of smack heads.

48:53.740 --> 48:55.770
Yeah, is it?

48:55.820 --> 48:58.330
They just keep you waiting
for hours and stuff,

48:58.380 --> 49:01.210
and I said to this guy,
"Look, love, time's money."

49:01.260 --> 49:02.570
It is, you know, to be fair.

49:02.620 --> 49:04.970
Hmm. You hungry?

49:05.020 --> 49:07.370
I'm always hungry, me. I'm like a dustbin.

49:07.420 --> 49:12.210
- She is, she's like a dustbin. - You
looking after yourself? - Mm-hmm.

49:12.260 --> 49:15.340
Yeah, yeah, she's good, yeah.
I keep an eye out for her.

49:16.380 --> 49:19.650
Why do they always put sweetcorn
in with tuna, who invented that?

49:19.700 --> 49:25.090
- Take them all between you, go on.
- You sure, lovely? - Yeah. - Thank you.

49:25.140 --> 49:28.970
- Do you like my new eyeliner, Mrs
Cawood? - Oh, yeah. - Isn't she pretty?

49:29.020 --> 49:34.010
- Where'd you nick that from, then,
Leone? - Boots. Boots's. - OK.

49:34.060 --> 49:38.170
Listen, you need to know, we've got
a bit of a weirdo doing the rounds.

49:38.220 --> 49:41.250
He's killed three girls,
women, one in Elland,

49:41.300 --> 49:45.130
one in Brighouse and another
one two days ago up Ovenden.

49:45.180 --> 49:47.730
There's going to be an
announcement later this aft,

49:47.780 --> 49:52.810
but he's targeting vulnerable
people like yourselves. All right?

49:52.860 --> 49:55.770
And he's not just killing
them, he's doing stuff to them.

49:55.820 --> 49:58.730
I can't really tell you what, I'll
leave that to your imagination,

49:58.780 --> 50:01.170
but it's not much fun, so you
need to be aware, all right?

50:01.220 --> 50:04.130
You need to have eyes in your
backside. Leone, are you listening?

50:12.540 --> 50:16.050
Anyone who makes you feel
uncomfortable at all. Yeah?

50:16.100 --> 50:18.340
Promise me that you'll...

50:24.900 --> 50:27.700
- Who's that?
- Don't know.

50:36.540 --> 50:40.810
And it's been going on
for months, she reckons.

50:40.860 --> 50:43.740
She thinks it were even going
on before Daisy were born.

50:45.180 --> 50:46.610
I'm not saying owt to him.

50:46.660 --> 50:49.050
If he wants to talk to
me, he'll talk to me.

50:49.100 --> 50:52.210
- I'm not starting interfering in
other people's marriages. - Course.

50:52.260 --> 50:55.210
Whether it's true or not.
Although, why would she make it up?

50:55.260 --> 50:58.690
I don't think she would. She might
have got t'wrong end of the stick.

50:58.740 --> 51:01.250
We'll have to tidy out the spare
bedroom if he is stopping.

51:01.300 --> 51:03.930
He's not camping out in t'sitting
room for any length of time,

51:03.980 --> 51:06.090
- it's not fair on Ryan, or us.
- I could move out.

51:06.140 --> 51:07.490
You're not moving out.

51:07.540 --> 51:10.970
It's more his home than mine,
though, in't it, technically?

51:11.020 --> 51:12.260
Don't say that.

51:38.100 --> 51:39.620
- Dad?
- Huh?

51:40.980 --> 51:42.340
Oh...

52:06.700 --> 52:11.450
- Can I get a biscuit, Uncle Daniel?
- Yeah. Suppose so.

52:11.500 --> 52:14.500
- You know where they are?
- You want one? - No, thanks.

52:15.820 --> 52:19.610
Actually, I might have a beer,
while Auntie Clare's out.

52:19.660 --> 52:23.090
Why can you not drink beer
when Auntie Clare's in?

52:23.140 --> 52:28.020
- Well, you can, but we don't,
do we? Because... - Why?

52:29.660 --> 52:31.650
She doesn't like it.

52:31.700 --> 52:33.010
Why?

52:33.060 --> 52:34.860
Well, um...

52:36.500 --> 52:40.290
Because she, um...

52:40.340 --> 52:42.540
- She's a...
- Is she an alcoholic?

52:44.540 --> 52:47.530
Er, well, yeah.

52:47.580 --> 52:49.970
Yeah, she is. Was.

52:50.020 --> 52:51.300
Is.

52:53.460 --> 52:55.780
What is an alcoholic?

53:06.260 --> 53:07.460
Hiya.

53:10.020 --> 53:14.890
- I've got a reservation.
- Name, please? - Drummond.

53:14.940 --> 53:17.460
Frances Drummond.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.930
Passed out?

53:24.980 --> 53:26.260
Yeah.

53:27.260 --> 53:32.730
Sitting at my desk, banging
headache, no meal break, as usual.

53:32.780 --> 53:36.730
And I think I, yeah, just passed out.

53:36.780 --> 53:39.290
Well, then, you're working too
hard. You've got to tell him.

53:39.340 --> 53:41.410
Oh, yeah, that's going
to go down really well.

53:41.460 --> 53:43.810
We're just kicking off
this major investigation.

53:43.860 --> 53:45.420
Why did he keep you behind?

53:46.940 --> 53:49.690
Because, you know, I'm
the only one that knows

53:49.740 --> 53:52.050
this particular aspect of telecoms.

53:54.220 --> 53:57.210
Which is what one of the
big leads was yesterday.

53:57.260 --> 54:01.090
- You should go and see t'doctor.
- Well, if it happens again, I will.

54:01.140 --> 54:05.300
You do look pale. I thought
so when you came in.

54:09.220 --> 54:12.180
- I'm going to make some coffee,
do you want some? - Yeah, go on.

54:18.820 --> 54:20.260
Hello?

54:22.500 --> 54:24.900
Yeah, yeah, sure, he's
here. Who's calling?

54:26.780 --> 54:29.290
It's Vicky. From Forensics.

54:29.340 --> 54:31.100
Oh.

54:34.380 --> 54:38.890
- Hello? - 'I've just sent
you a text, have you seen it?'

54:38.940 --> 54:40.730
No.

54:40.780 --> 54:42.340
Please have a look.

54:51.620 --> 54:55.050
- Have you seen it?
- What's this? - What...?

54:55.100 --> 54:56.780
How have you...?

54:58.780 --> 55:00.610
What have you done, Vicky?

55:00.660 --> 55:05.050
I spent the last two years thinking
I had things to look forward to,

55:05.100 --> 55:06.850
a future.

55:06.900 --> 55:10.090
A life not on my own.

55:10.140 --> 55:11.980
And now, I find I've got nothing.

55:14.820 --> 55:18.170
I downloaded all your contacts
off your phone last night.

55:18.220 --> 55:20.580
'Just after I took those photos.

55:22.260 --> 55:26.770
'Your wife, your mum, your dad, your kids.

55:26.820 --> 55:29.970
'Your sister, your brother.'

55:30.020 --> 55:32.490
Your aunties, your cousins.

55:32.540 --> 55:35.850
Everyone you work with,
your bosses, your colleagues.

55:35.900 --> 55:39.690
Everyone at the rugby club.
Everyone at the Rotary.

55:39.740 --> 55:42.290
The bloke you bought your
car off, your doctor,

55:42.340 --> 55:45.970
- 'your dentist, your little
Amber's piano teacher.' - What...?

55:46.020 --> 55:48.730
'Someone you met at conferences
you've probably forgotten.

55:48.780 --> 55:51.410
- 'The list is endless.'
- What do you want?

55:51.460 --> 55:53.290
Money.

55:53.340 --> 55:55.530
Only money.

55:55.580 --> 55:57.210
How much?

55:57.260 --> 56:00.500
£1,000 a month.

56:02.340 --> 56:05.490
- Going forward.
- I can't, I can't, I can't do that.

56:05.540 --> 56:08.690
- Cash, obviously.
- I can't, Vicky, I can't!

56:08.740 --> 56:12.490
Oh, I think you can, I think
you might be foolish not to.

56:12.540 --> 56:17.180
First payment's due, shall
we say, a week today?

56:19.140 --> 56:20.740
'Where shall we meet?'

56:23.420 --> 56:26.730
Yeah, perhaps you'd
like to think about that.

56:26.780 --> 56:29.770
'I do realise I'm playing with fire.'

56:29.820 --> 56:33.090
With you being a policeman and everything.

56:33.140 --> 56:37.730
But perhaps you can take that
as a measure of how upset,

56:37.780 --> 56:42.420
how messed around, how pissed off I feel!

56:45.180 --> 56:48.540
'I also realise how easy it would
be for you to tell someone at work.

56:50.380 --> 56:53.370
'But please understand that, if you do,'

56:53.420 --> 56:57.530
it will literally take me a matter
of seconds to send these images

56:57.580 --> 57:00.500
to every single person
in your address book.

57:02.580 --> 57:04.620
John.

57:12.340 --> 57:16.770
- No! - Yes! - No way! - Eat shit, Dan.

57:16.820 --> 57:19.690
Oi, hey! What would your granny say?

57:19.740 --> 57:22.380
That's what she says.
