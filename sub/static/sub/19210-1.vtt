I didn't mean to surprise you.
You're okay.

01:32:14.739 --> 01:32:16.157
Kelli, this is Antonia.

01:32:16.532 --> 01:32:19.202
Antonia, this is Kelli.

01:32:19.952 --> 01:32:21.746
It is nice to meet you.

01:32:23.915 --> 01:32:25.333
Can we tell you
a story?

01:32:26.751 --> 01:32:28.085
Whatever.

01:32:28.336 --> 01:32:29.962
It's your money.

01:32:30.922 --> 01:32:34.717
A year ago, just about,

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:38.095
I met a woman
a lot like you.

01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:44.769
She'd been lied to and forced
into the same situation.

01:32:45.061 --> 01:32:48.773
Men decided she was
worth a certain price.

01:32:56.656 --> 01:32:59.283
I fell in love
with that woman.

01:33:00.701 --> 01:33:04.997
And to me, she is worth more
than all the money in the world.

01:33:08.125 --> 01:33:11.254
You have that same worth
inside of you.

01:33:13.172 --> 01:33:19.011
Kelli, you've been taught to talk and
dress and act like you're cheap.

01:33:22.974 --> 01:33:24.016
We think... No.

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:27.770
We believe that there's a God that
knows exactly what you're worth.

01:33:30.982 --> 01:33:35.152
Look, this is my choice.

01:33:37.405 --> 01:33:41.367
And that means that you have the
freedom to make another choice.

01:33:43.703 --> 01:33:44.996
JAMES: Hey.

01:33:50.084 --> 01:33:52.420
This doesn't have to
define you.

01:33:56.841 --> 01:33:58.884
(SNIFFLING)

01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:09.020
JAMES: <i>It's in these moments I think
of my old friend and what he did.</i>

01:34:09.729 --> 01:34:11.272
<i>And I know he sees us.</i>

01:34:12.273 --> 01:34:14.442
<i>I know he's looking down
from up there.</i>

01:34:16.861 --> 01:34:18.612
<i>His death gave life.</i>

01:34:20.781 --> 01:34:23.284
<i>It gave us each other.</i>

01:34:25.953 --> 01:34:30.207
<i>It gave us a new world,
a new understanding of love.</i>

01:34:34.879 --> 01:34:37.048
<i>Led a father back
to his daughter.</i>

01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:43.220
<i>Led a woman to a new life.</i>

01:34:43.596 --> 01:34:45.306
<i>A new chance.</i>

01:34:47.058 --> 01:34:50.853
<i>And it led us to this place.</i>

01:34:53.814 --> 01:34:58.652
<i>A place where a woman can
rediscover her immeasurable worth,</i>

01:34:58.736 --> 01:35:01.739
<i>passed down to us
by God himself.</i>

01:35:08.662 --> 01:35:11.123
<i>And so
the story continues on,</i>

01:35:11.749 --> 01:35:14.919
<i>and so does
this deep knowledge</i>

01:35:15.002 --> 01:35:17.046
<i>that every life,</i>

01:35:17.129 --> 01:35:20.633
<i>man, woman, boy, and girl,</i>

01:35:22.927 --> 01:35:25.596
<i>is incredibly, undoubtedly,</i>

01:35:26.639 --> 01:35:28.265
<i>completely</i>

01:35:29.642 --> 01:35:31.143
<i>priceless.</i>

01:36:01.173 --> 01:36:03.217
