You're all in the seventh grade now
and I know you can do better than this.

01:39.566 --> 01:43.400
So when I give you
a list of words, study them.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.301
Akeelah!

01:45.338 --> 01:47.602
How long did you study
for this spelling test?

01:47.640 --> 01:50.473
(children laughing)

01:50.510 --> 01:52.068
I didn't.

01:55.281 --> 01:59.081
See me after class.
Okay, you two need to turn around.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.314
Enough!

02:03.123 --> 02:06.183
You know, you could be
one of my very best students.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.353
But you don't turn in
half your homework.

02:08.394 --> 02:10.692
Sometimes you don't even
show up for class.

02:10.729 --> 02:13.130
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

02:18.004 --> 02:19.369
Have you heard of...

02:21.174 --> 02:23.301
have you heard
of next week's spelling bee?

02:23.343 --> 02:25.277
No.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.302
Well, I think you should
sign up for it.

02:32.418 --> 02:34.750
Does he really think I'm
gonna be walking around

02:34.787 --> 02:37.722
with somebody in little shorts
like that? He crazy!

02:37.757 --> 02:41.284
- Ooh, is Devon coming back today?
- Yeah. Got a two-week leave.

02:41.327 --> 02:45.161
Your brother is fine!
I got it all figured out... look.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.792
He gonna be the pilot
on a big commercial jet

02:47.834 --> 02:50.325
and I'm gonna be
the flight attendant.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.930
Got any change
for an old man, girls?

02:52.972 --> 02:54.872
Ain't got no change for myself.

02:54.908 --> 02:58.309
(hip-hop music playing)

02:58.344 --> 03:01.006
Damn, Derrick-T's new ride is tight!

03:02.916 --> 03:05.680
He's been trying to get
Terrence in trouble.

03:05.718 --> 03:08.209
Girl, your bro can get
his own self in trouble.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.916
- So what'd Ms. Cross want?
- Nothin'.

03:10.957 --> 03:13.482
Just talking about
some stupid-ass spelling bee.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.494
You gonna do it?

03:15.528 --> 03:18.326
- You'd probably be good.
- And get up in front of everybody?

03:18.364 --> 03:20.594
I'd probably pee in my pants.

03:21.601 --> 03:24.434
Tell me about the boy in your class
with the itty-bitty shorts.

03:24.470 --> 03:25.528
I think he's cute.

- Keelie, Mama says go eat.
- I'm about to get a high score.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.591
- One minute.
- I don't care.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.093
Mama says go eat!

03:48.127 --> 03:51.324
Oh yeah! I've been dreaming about
your cooking for the past five months.

03:51.364 --> 03:52.729
Let me take that.

03:52.765 --> 03:55.325
At least I got one baby
appreciate what I do around here.

03:55.368 --> 03:58.531
We all appreciate you.
Hey... give me some sugar.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.233
- Where is Terrence?
- I don't know. Maybe still at practice.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.435
Practice was over an hour ago.
I know one thing...

04:03.476 --> 04:05.569
he better not be hanging out
with no Derrick-T.

04:05.612 --> 04:07.580
Derrick-T?
That fool still alive?

04:07.614 --> 04:09.946
- Not after you get done with him.
- That's right.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.814
- Hey, you.
- So...

04:11.851 --> 04:13.876
how many planes have you
shot down so far?

04:13.920 --> 04:16.548
So far zero. But you don't do
too much shooting sitting behind

04:16.589 --> 04:18.682
- a computer screen in Nevada.
- Oooh, good.

04:18.725 --> 04:21.023
You stay on the ground.
Let them white boys go up there.

04:21.060 --> 04:24.052
- You stay down here where you belong.
- Mama, I'm gonna have my wings

04:24.097 --> 04:27.294
and my college degree before you know
it... unless this one beats me to it.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.563
Not skipping class
with Georgia Cavanaugh, she won't.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.162
- Skipping class?
- Only PE.

04:32.205 --> 04:35.641
- You better not be skipping no class.
- Akeelah, go turn off that television.

04:35.675 --> 04:37.973
Hey, hey... flip it over
to ESPN real quick

04:38.011 --> 04:40.343
and let me check out
that Laker score, all right?

04:40.380 --> 04:42.371
<i>I need you to talk to Terrence...</i>

04:42.415 --> 04:44.849

you will be the champion.

04:51.858 --> 04:55.089
- What's this?
- Akeelah, turn off the TV now.

<i>- "Brunneous."

<i>You are the Scripps

05:11.944 --> 05:13.969
Akeelah needs to listen!

05:14.013 --> 05:16.004
Turn it off now!

05:18.551 --> 05:20.143
Brunneous...

05:20.186 --> 05:22.677
brunneous?

05:26.192 --> 05:28.888
"Brunneous: Dark brown;

05:28.928 --> 05:31.624
used chiefly scientifically."

05:31.664 --> 05:34.224
Well, why can't they just say brown?

05:36.436 --> 05:39.269
Daddy, have you ever
heard of this word?

05:44.043 --> 05:47.240
Yeah, probably did.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.049
Hey, freak.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.320
We want you to take care
of our English homework.

06:32.358 --> 06:35.259
- Everybody say you a brainiac.
- I ain't no brainiac.

06:35.294 --> 06:39.697
Like hell you ain't!
Always got them A's down, right?

06:39.732 --> 06:41.461
Yeah, she's scared of us.

06:41.501 --> 06:42.695
Don't run away...

06:42.735 --> 06:45.704
I cannot thank you enough
for coming down here today, Josh.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.070
I've got the district
breathing down my back.

06:48.107 --> 06:50.541
The test scores have
gone down again this year.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.545
As I said earlier,
I appreciate your dilemma, Bob,

06:53.579 --> 06:57.310
but I really don't understand
what it is I have to offer.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.841
No no no, all I want you to do
is look at these kids

06:59.886 --> 07:02.218
and tell me if you think
my idea's crazy.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.450
I think some of them
have a lot of potential.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.219
Girls!
Why aren't you in class?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.727
- She holding us up.
- Akeelah!

07:10.563 --> 07:13.157
Are you signed up
for the spelling bee today?

07:13.199 --> 07:14.564
No.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.569
I want you to come
to my office, please.

07:20.139 --> 07:23.006
So, Ms. Cross tells me

07:23.042 --> 07:25.670
you've never missed a word
on your spelling tests.

07:25.711 --> 07:28.805
But your attendance record
leaves a little to be desired.

07:29.816 --> 07:33.411
- You're 11, did you skip a grade?
- The second.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.824
Akeelah, have you ever heard
of the Scripps National Spelling Bee?

07:39.859 --> 07:43.226
- I think it was on TV last week.
- Yes!

07:43.262 --> 07:45.787
Yes, they show it
on ESPN every year.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.596
Middle school students
from all over the country

07:48.634 --> 07:52.695
compete in school district
and regional spelling bees

07:52.738 --> 07:56.504
trying to make it to the national
spelling bee in Washington DC.

07:56.542 --> 07:59.306
Next year, I want
one of our students there.

07:59.345 --> 08:02.143
So whoever wins
the school bee today

08:02.181 --> 08:05.412
gets to represent Crenshaw
at the district bee

08:05.451 --> 08:07.783
- next month.
- Why would anybody want

08:07.820 --> 08:11.347
to represents a school that can't even
put doors on the toilet stalls?

08:11.390 --> 08:13.381
<i>(Joshua coughs)</i>

08:14.627 --> 08:17.289
Akeelah, if we can't show
our students can perform,

08:17.330 --> 08:20.356
we're not going to have money for books,
let alone bathroom doors.

08:20.399 --> 08:22.526
Now, I want you to do
the bee today, all right?

08:22.568 --> 08:25.230
So everybody can call me
a freak and a brainiac?

08:25.271 --> 08:28.172
No, I ain't down
for no spelling bee.

08:29.208 --> 08:33.144
Well, maybe you'd be "down" for spending
the rest of the semester

08:33.179 --> 08:36.080
in detention
for all of your absences.

08:36.115 --> 08:38.106
I'd like to welcome you all

08:38.150 --> 08:41.347
to Crenshaw's first schoolwide
spelling bee.

08:41.386 --> 08:45.084
We have some very special students
competing today,

08:45.124 --> 08:47.319
so let's give them all
a round of applause.

08:48.561 --> 08:50.051
(laughing)

08:50.096 --> 08:52.087
Whoo!

08:53.399 --> 08:56.425
Okay, we drew numbers to see
who would go first,

08:56.469 --> 08:59.905
and that's Chuckie Johnson
from the eighth grade.

08:59.939 --> 09:03.170
Hey hey hey, Chuckie
ba-ba-baby.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.609
Mr. Welch, I have a question
about the basketball nets.

09:05.645 --> 09:08.739
Chuckie!
You need to pay attention.

09:08.781 --> 09:12.547
Now, we're gonna start things off
with "grovel."

09:12.585 --> 09:14.610
Gravel, like little rocks?

09:15.821 --> 09:18.085
No, grovel like

09:18.124 --> 09:20.456
get down
on your knees and grovel.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.859
Get down on my knees?
What?!

09:22.895 --> 09:24.795
<i>Just spell the word.</i>

09:24.830 --> 09:27.628
Uh, G-R...

09:27.667 --> 09:30.465
A-V-E-L.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.835
No, Chuckie, you spelled gravel.

09:32.872 --> 09:36.638
<i>I meant grovel: G-R-O-V-E-L.</i>

09:36.676 --> 09:39.372
You weren't listening.
I'm sorry, Chuckie.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.040
- Who cares?
- Okay, next up,

09:42.081 --> 09:44.811
<i>Akeelah Anderson.</i>

09:44.850 --> 09:47.444
Oh, you go, girl!

09:48.521 --> 09:52.116
Akeelah, your word is "doubt."

09:52.158 --> 09:55.616
- Doubt.
- D-O-U-B-T.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.152
I'm sorry, Akeelah,
you have to speak up.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.324
D-O-U-B-T.

10:00.366 --> 10:02.129
Very good.

10:05.304 --> 10:07.465
<i>Next, Calvin Baker...</i>

10:07.506 --> 10:10.634
P-L-A-S-l-D.

10:10.676 --> 10:12.769
Placid.

10:12.812 --> 10:16.578
I'm sorry,
it's P-L-A-C-l-D.

10:20.486 --> 10:23.046
Okay, Akeelah,
if you get this word

10:23.089 --> 10:25.751
you will be the winner.
"Fanciful."

10:25.791 --> 10:28.351
- Fan...
- F-A-N-C-l-F-U-L.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.328
<i>- Girl: Whoa.
- That is correct,</i>

10:30.363 --> 10:33.423
and you have won Crenshaw's
inaugural spelling bee.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.093
Whoo!

10:35.134 --> 10:36.465
Whatever.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.838
Excuse me.

10:44.043 --> 10:46.102
Spell "prestidigitation."

10:47.680 --> 10:50.843
I'm sorry, sir,
but this girl is only 11,

10:50.883 --> 10:54.148
<i>and she's already won.
Mr. Welch, what is this?</i>

10:56.222 --> 10:59.885
Prestidigitation,
can you spell it?

11:08.034 --> 11:13.666
P-R-E-S-T-l-D-l-G-l-T-A-T-l-O-N,

11:13.706 --> 11:16.504
prestidigitation.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.601
That's correct.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.635
Whoo!

11:22.715 --> 11:28.017
- "Ambidextrous."
- A-M-B-l-D-E-X-T-R-O-U-S.

11:28.054 --> 11:32.684
- "Pterodactyl."
- P-T-E-R-O-D-A-C-T-Y-L.

11:32.725 --> 11:36.286
- "Pulchritude."
- P...

11:39.899 --> 11:42.493
P-U-L-C...

11:45.771 --> 11:47.466
R...

11:47.506 --> 11:50.600
l-T-U-D-E...

11:51.811 --> 11:54.371
pulchritude?

11:54.413 --> 11:58.349
That's incorrect.
It's from the Latin root "pulcher"

11:58.384 --> 12:01.820
and there's an H after the C.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.854
<i>See?
She ain't so smart.</i>

12:06.892 --> 12:08.883
(laughing)

12:13.399 --> 12:16.061
- Run for it! See ya!
- Bye, sweetie.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.697
Akeelah, wait!

12:19.739 --> 12:21.730
Where are you going?
You did great.

12:21.774 --> 12:24.174
You were spelling words
I don't know how to spell.

12:24.210 --> 12:28.112
Mr. Welch, I told you I did not want
to do this. They're laughing at me.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.877
They laugh
because you intimidate them.

12:30.916 --> 12:34.443
But if you'd stood your ground,
you might have earned their respect.

12:34.487 --> 12:38.150
Bob, the girl has potential
but she needs to be coached.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.558
Do you know who that was?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.790
That was Dr. Joshua Larabee.

12:44.830 --> 12:47.128
<i>He used to chair
the English department at UCLA.</i>

12:47.166 --> 12:49.794
He and I went to college together.
But get this...

12:49.835 --> 12:52.998
when he was a kid, he went all the way
to the national spelling bee.

12:53.038 --> 12:55.973
And he thinks you have a chance
of going there yourself.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.999
I'm sorry,

12:58.043 --> 12:59.943
but I ain't doin'
no more spelling bees.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.004
Akeelah...

13:03.616 --> 13:06.608
Girl, you kicked some major booty
on that stage today.

13:06.652 --> 13:09.280
But I couldn't spell pulchritude.

13:09.321 --> 13:12.119
But you knocked all them other words
right back at that dude.

13:12.158 --> 13:16.060
They were just trick words. Everybody
knows pterodactyl starts with a P.

13:16.095 --> 13:20.122
Girl, if I could spell like you,
I know I could be a flight attendant.

13:23.002 --> 13:25.095
<i>Devon:
Keelie, hey, wake up.</i>

13:27.239 --> 13:29.036
Hey.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.600
- Dev, are you leaving?
- Yeah, gotta get back to the base.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.444
Hey, your principal
called Mama.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.246
Said you did real good
in the spelling bee last week.

13:39.285 --> 13:42.152
<i>- I messed up a word.
- He said you got a lot of them right.</i>

13:42.188 --> 13:44.213
He also said
you've got an opportunity

13:44.256 --> 13:46.315
to go to an even bigger
contest next week.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.986
- I don't want to do it.
- Why not?

13:49.028 --> 13:51.087
Everybody's gonna be
looking at me

13:51.130 --> 13:53.394
and there's gonna be
tons of words I don't know.

13:53.432 --> 13:55.866
So you're scared, huh?

13:55.901 --> 13:59.029
<i>How do you think I felt the first time
I had to jump out of an airplane?</i>

13:59.071 --> 14:01.699
I mean, my whole body
said "Don't do it."

14:01.740 --> 14:05.335
But sometimes your brain gotta be
smarter than your body, you know?

14:05.377 --> 14:07.277
But I don't like my school.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.975
I don't see why I gotta do
anything for them.

14:12.451 --> 14:15.011
Then do it for Dad.

14:15.054 --> 14:17.079
I mean, you know
how he was about words.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.647
He'd have loved to see you
do something like this.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.957
- What'd Mama say about it?
- You know how Mama is.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.327
She got a million things
to worry about.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.559
<i>Tell you what,</i>

14:27.600 --> 14:29.534
just do this contest,

14:29.568 --> 14:31.729
and if you make it all the way to DC,

14:31.770 --> 14:33.931
I will parachute down to see you.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.736
<i>Would you like that?</i>

14:52.958 --> 14:56.724
That is a wonderful decision, Akeelah,
a wonderful decision.

14:56.762 --> 14:59.697
You think maybe the school
could buy me a new outfit,

14:59.732 --> 15:02.132
you know, for the district bee?

15:02.167 --> 15:05.159
Uh... I don't know, maybe.

15:05.204 --> 15:09.265
If you make it to the state regional,
maybe something could be arranged.

15:09.308 --> 15:13.176
But you're gonna have to finish in
the top 10 at the district level first.

15:13.212 --> 15:16.670
And, Akeelah, you're going to be going
up against kids from Santa Monica,

15:16.715 --> 15:18.649
Woodland Hills, Beverly Hills.

15:18.684 --> 15:22.245
Some of these kids have been doing this
for years and never even made it to DC.

15:22.288 --> 15:25.018
- Well, maybe I should just give up now.
- No no no.

15:25.057 --> 15:28.959
No, I'm just saying
you need to train hard.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.792
- With Dr. Larabee.
- What?

15:31.830 --> 15:34.594
I don't need any help from him.
I could do this on my own.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.397
Akeelah, the best spellers
in the world have coaches.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.631
<i>I finally got him to consider
taking some time</i>

15:39.672 --> 15:41.731
during his sabbatical
to work with you.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.334
Please, just talk with him.

15:44.376 --> 15:46.844
Here.
He doesn't live far from here.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.847
He lives in this neighborhood?

15:48.881 --> 15:51.349
I thought you said
he was important.

15:51.383 --> 15:54.147
And take this, it's a copy
of last year's spelling bee.

15:54.186 --> 15:57.280
<i>- "Sacciform."
- May I have the definition, please?</i>

15:57.323 --> 15:58.722
<i>Resembling a pouch.</i>

15:58.757 --> 16:00.748
May I have the language
of origin, please?

16:00.793 --> 16:02.556
<i>- Latin.
- Latin?</i>

16:02.594 --> 16:05.654
I thought this was
supposed to be English.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.791
<i>... l-F-O-R...</i>

16:09.802 --> 16:12.862
"Scutellate"?
Can I have the definition?

16:14.506 --> 16:16.667
"Longicollis."

16:16.709 --> 16:18.973
- "Ginglymus."
- "Empennage."

16:19.011 --> 16:21.002
- "Souchong."
- "Intussusception."

16:21.046 --> 16:23.378
<i>- Hey, what's dat?
- Any alternate pronunciations?</i>

16:23.415 --> 16:26.543
Where you been?
Mama's worried.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.610
Mama should just chill, a'ight?

16:28.654 --> 16:31.782
- What you looking at?
- Spelling bee.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.292
Oh yeah, I heard about that.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.954
You going up against
a bunch of rich white kids.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.988
They gonna tear your black ass up.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.800
<i>Man:
Intussusception is</i>

16:43.836 --> 16:49.069
<i>l- N-T-U-S-S-U-S-C-E-P-T-l-O-N.</i>

16:57.449 --> 16:59.440
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

17:02.688 --> 17:04.679
<i>(hammering)</i>

17:22.540 --> 17:24.509
You're late.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.671
- You didn't answer the door.
- That's because you're late.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.681
Come in.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.876
Come come come.

17:36.155 --> 17:38.487
So...

17:38.524 --> 17:41.357
- you want to learn how to spell.
- I know how to spell.

17:41.393 --> 17:44.385
- Spell "staphylococci."
- Um...

17:44.430 --> 17:47.024
S-T-A-F...

17:47.066 --> 17:51.127
There is no F. It's derived
from the Greek so there can't be an F.

17:51.170 --> 17:54.037
Staphylococci:
S-T-A...

17:54.073 --> 17:56.871
P-H-Y...

17:56.909 --> 17:59.241
L-O-C-O...

17:59.278 --> 18:00.973
C-C-I.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.947
<i>Winning word,
national spelling bee</i>

18:02.981 --> 18:04.608
<i>1987.</i>

18:04.650 --> 18:07.118
The first thing
most serious spellers do

18:07.152 --> 18:10.588
is learn all of the winning words
and their origins.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.749
Well, maybe I ain't that serious.

18:13.792 --> 18:16.090
Maybe neither am I.

18:16.128 --> 18:18.358
So why are you home
during the day?

18:18.397 --> 18:20.558
<i>- Ain't you got a job?
- Do me a favor,</i>

18:20.599 --> 18:22.726
leave the ghetto talk
outside, all right?

18:22.768 --> 18:24.633
Ghetto talk?
I don't talk ghetto.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.467
Hm, "ain't you got no job?"

18:26.505 --> 18:29.474
<i>You use that language
to fit in with your friends.</i>

18:29.508 --> 18:32.306
Here you will speak properly
or you won't speak at all.

18:32.344 --> 18:34.403
<i>- Understood?
- Yeah.</i>

18:35.414 --> 18:37.541
Whatever.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.983
- You can leave now.
- Excuse me?

18:40.018 --> 18:42.077
- I said you can leave.
- How come?

18:42.121 --> 18:46.319
Because I don't have time
to waste on insolent little girls.

18:46.358 --> 18:49.521
Insolent?
I ain't insol...

18:49.561 --> 18:51.290
I mean I'm not insolent.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.163
It's just the first thing you do
is start doggin' on...

18:55.167 --> 18:57.601
criticizing the way I speak.

18:59.538 --> 19:02.132
I thought this was
just about spelling words.

19:04.943 --> 19:07.070
Well then, fine.

19:13.919 --> 19:16.217
You know what?

19:16.255 --> 19:20.316
When I put my mind to it,
I can memorize anything.

19:20.359 --> 19:24.056
And I don't need help
from a dictatorial, truculent,

19:24.096 --> 19:26.826
supercilious gardener.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.499
I'm sorry to be so insolent.

19:39.511 --> 19:43.709
Lymphomatotic: L-Y-M...
Laboratory: L-A-B-O-R...

19:43.749 --> 19:46.081
Preglacial...

19:46.118 --> 19:48.052
Irreferable: L-R-R...

19:48.086 --> 19:50.247
Erythroplasia: E-R-Y-T-H...

19:50.289 --> 19:52.553
<i>- Microzoospore...
- Hey.</i>

19:52.591 --> 19:54.491
Baby, what are you still doing up?

19:54.526 --> 19:56.323
I've gotta learn more words.

19:56.361 --> 19:59.660
You gonna come see me
in the district bee this Saturday?

19:59.698 --> 20:02.724
- What, is that at your school?
- Naw.

20:02.768 --> 20:05.134
- Beverly Hills.
- Beverly Hills?

20:06.538 --> 20:09.006
Look, you got other homework.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.670
You need to focus on that. I don't want
you spending all your time on this game.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.509
It ain't a game!
Are you gonna come see me in it?

20:16.949 --> 20:19.509
You know I work at the hospital
on Saturday.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.451
Maybe Kiana can go with you.

20:21.486 --> 20:24.284
As long as she don't bring
that whiny baby.

20:24.323 --> 20:26.291
(baby crying)

20:27.292 --> 20:30.557
Come on, girls, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.302
Dang.

20:43.342 --> 20:45.810
I hope they ain't all here to spell.

20:45.844 --> 20:47.869
Okay, go get your number.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.746
- We'll be sitting back here.
- Good luck, Keelie.

21:09.968 --> 21:11.492
Hi. Name?

21:11.536 --> 21:14.061
Akeelah Anderson.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.165
Right here at the top.

21:16.208 --> 21:20.611
I think you're the first speller we've
ever had from Crenshaw Middle School.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.911
Um... how many kids
are in this thing?

21:23.949 --> 21:25.940
139.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.977
Next.

21:33.292 --> 21:37.626
Need some help?
Don't worry, I won't impale you.

21:37.663 --> 21:40.223
- This your first time?
- Yeah.

21:40.265 --> 21:42.324
- You?
- Second year.

21:42.367 --> 21:45.928
I made it to nationals last year,
finished 13th.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.495
Lucky 13.

21:47.539 --> 21:49.973
You went all the way to DC?

21:50.008 --> 21:52.841
Three of us made it from my school
in Woodland Hills.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.039
See that kid right there?

21:55.080 --> 21:56.980
That's Dylan Chiu.

21:57.015 --> 22:00.212
He's come in second place
at nationals for two years in a row.

22:00.252 --> 22:03.380
This is his last year and everybody
thinks he's gonna win.

22:03.422 --> 22:06.357
Frankly, I'd like to shove him
off a steep precipice.

22:08.026 --> 22:09.687
Hey, my name is Javier.

22:09.728 --> 22:11.719
- I'm Akeelah.
- Hope you make the top 10.

22:11.763 --> 22:13.754
I hope I'm not the first one out.

22:13.799 --> 22:16.427
<i>Man: Will all the spellers take
their positions on stage, please?</i>

22:16.468 --> 22:19.528
Remember, if you don't know how to spell
a word, spell it the way it sounds.

22:19.571 --> 22:23.166
Kids mess up all the time when they
think they're being thrown curveballs,

22:23.208 --> 22:25.335
<i>- and they're not. Good luck.
- Good luck to you too.</i>

22:25.377 --> 22:28.073
<i>- Thank you.

<i>May I have a definition, please?</i>

22:58.210 --> 23:01.873

Ah, rhesus.

R-H-E-S-U-S,

23:06.551 --> 23:08.883

That's correct.

23:12.424 --> 23:14.358

23:24.102 --> 23:25.967

23:40.752 --> 23:42.811
<i>Man: Did you hear the word?</i>

23:42.854 --> 23:47.951
I'm not sure if you're saying
imminent or eminent.

23:47.993 --> 23:51.520
- Would you like a definition?
- That'd be cool.

The top 10 qualify for
the Southern California regional finals.

25:37.102 --> 25:38.729
In the next round...

25:38.770 --> 25:40.761
<i>(baby crying)</i>

25:42.574 --> 25:45.702
- If you miss a word
do not leave the stage...

25:49.314 --> 25:53.751
- as you may have an opportunity
to compete for any remaining places.

25:53.785 --> 25:55.878
Kiana, get that baby out of here.

25:59.691 --> 26:01.716
So...

26:03.895 --> 26:05.886
let's begin.

26:05.931 --> 26:10.732
...L- L-O-G-l-Z-E, syllogize.

26:10.769 --> 26:13.203
That's correct.

26:23.782 --> 26:25.977
"Synecdoche."

26:29.321 --> 26:31.380
Si-neck-do-kee?

26:31.423 --> 26:33.482
Synecdoche.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.093
You wanna tell me
what that means?

26:38.129 --> 26:42.293
<i>A figure of speech
in which a part is used for a whole;</i>

26:42.334 --> 26:45.030
<i>an individual for a class;</i>

26:45.070 --> 26:48.972
<i>a material for a thing;
or the reverse of any of these.</i>

26:52.577 --> 26:54.568
(feedback)

26:57.415 --> 27:00.009
<i>Man:
We need you to spell the word.</i>

27:01.386 --> 27:03.684
S...

27:05.590 --> 27:07.854
<i>I...</i>

27:09.728 --> 27:11.696
N...

27:11.730 --> 27:14.164
<i>E...</i>

27:15.166 --> 27:17.498
C...

27:17.535 --> 27:20.299
<i>D- O...</i>

27:25.210 --> 27:27.337
K-E-Y?

27:27.379 --> 27:29.643
Synecdoche?

27:30.849 --> 27:32.840
<i>(bell rings)</i>

27:33.852 --> 27:35.547
<i>Woman:
The correct spelling is</i>

27:35.587 --> 27:38.317
<i>S- Y-N-E-C...</i>

27:38.356 --> 27:41.553
<i>D- O-C-H-E.</i>

27:48.366 --> 27:51.335
<i>Man:
If you spell this correctly,</i>

27:51.369 --> 27:53.860
you'll be our 10th and last finalist.

27:53.905 --> 27:56.305
<i>Woman:
"Carmagnole."</i>

28:00.378 --> 28:02.676
Could I get a definition, please?

28:02.714 --> 28:05.182
<i>A lively song and street dance.</i>

28:06.418 --> 28:07.885
Um...

28:07.919 --> 28:11.047
C... A...

28:11.089 --> 28:13.421
<i>R...</i>

28:13.458 --> 28:16.859
M... A...

28:27.939 --> 28:32.740
G-N-O-L-E,
carmagnole.

28:32.777 --> 28:37.009
That's correct and that means
you are our 10th and last finalist

28:37.048 --> 28:39.346
<i>for the district bee.</i>

28:42.787 --> 28:45.017
They cheated!
They cheated!

28:45.056 --> 28:48.287
I saw them!
That boy's mama helped him out.

28:48.326 --> 28:50.760
<i>Man:
What... excuse me.</i>

28:51.896 --> 28:53.921
<i>- Who are you?
- I'm Keelie's sister.</i>

28:53.965 --> 28:57.594
I was standing back there and I saw
that boy's mama give him the letter G.

28:57.635 --> 29:00.103
She was saying "geeeee."

29:00.138 --> 29:03.130
He knew the word!
I mean... it's one we studied.

29:03.174 --> 29:04.698
<i>- He knew it.
- Ma'am...</i>

29:04.743 --> 29:07.871
did you help your child
spell the word?

29:09.314 --> 29:11.782
Ma'am, this is serious business.

29:15.620 --> 29:19.818
Oh, you're damn right it's serious!
You are gonna give these kids ulcers!

29:19.858 --> 29:22.452
<i>Do you know how long
he has studied for this?</i>

29:22.494 --> 29:24.928
<i>- He knew that word.
- No,</i>

29:24.963 --> 29:26.658
I didn't.

29:30.301 --> 29:33.429
I'm sorry, number 62,

29:33.471 --> 29:35.996
you are disqualified
from competition.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.736
Which means, number 54,

29:38.777 --> 29:41.803
if you can spell
one more word correctly

29:41.846 --> 29:45.213
<i>you'll be our 10th
and last finalist.</i>

29:54.793 --> 29:55.919
"Pastiche."

30:00.532 --> 30:05.526
P-A-S-T-l-C-H-E,

30:05.570 --> 30:07.435
pastiche.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.635
That's correct.
That means you've qualified

30:10.675 --> 30:13.405
<i>for the Southern California
regional finals.</i>

30:17.749 --> 30:20.775
Here's my number. We have
a spelling club in my school, maybe you

30:20.819 --> 30:23.549
- should come practice with us sometime.
- That sounds fun.

30:23.588 --> 30:26.557
Yeah, it's cool. Hey, there's my folks.
I'll catch you later.

30:26.591 --> 30:29.389
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

30:29.427 --> 30:33.523
Hey, check it out... look at this.
They're gonna be at USC this summer.

30:33.565 --> 30:37.331
Just think, Akeelah, all you've got
to do is place in the top three

30:37.368 --> 30:41.168
of the state regionals,
and you're going to Washington DC.

30:41.206 --> 30:44.039
Not if I can't spell synecdoche.

30:44.075 --> 30:46.339
Uh-oh, y'all, look.

30:46.377 --> 30:49.107
I told you to wear a shirt and tie.
As long as you live in my house

30:49.147 --> 30:50.910
<i>- you do what I say. What did I say?
- Ma...</i>

30:50.949 --> 30:53.042
- No drugs, no gangbangin'...
- Why you stressing me?

30:53.084 --> 30:54.745
- And no $300 watches.
Take it off.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.481
<i>- Derrick-T gave me this. Yes.
- He did?</i>

30:56.521 --> 30:58.318
<i>- Then I'm gonna give it right back.
- Mom?</i>

30:58.356 --> 31:00.085
What?!
You two get inside.

31:00.124 --> 31:02.649
- Take it off.
- But, Mama, I made it.

31:02.694 --> 31:06.027
- Made what?
- Made the cut.

31:06.064 --> 31:08.328
I'm going to the regional bee.

31:08.366 --> 31:12.598
While you're doing that, I'm gonna be
identifying your brother in the morgue.

31:12.637 --> 31:15.071
<i>- No you're not. Ma...
- Yes, I am. Get inside before</i>

31:15.106 --> 31:16.869
I really embarrass your behind.

31:16.908 --> 31:20.605
- Akeelah?
- Akeelah, get in here!

31:21.980 --> 31:23.914
It's okay, Mr. Welch.

31:24.983 --> 31:27.281
I'll see you later.

31:28.319 --> 31:30.310
<i>(Tanya yelling)</i>

31:32.991 --> 31:35.084
Guess what.

31:37.028 --> 31:39.997
I'm going to the regional bee.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.990
<i>(helicopter circling)</i>

31:54.379 --> 31:56.370
<i>(siren wailing)</i>

32:29.380 --> 32:31.940
Radio: Cold blooded killers

32:31.983 --> 32:35.419
The sober overdose,
poems roam like freight trains...

32:46.664 --> 32:48.655
<i>(bell rings)</i>

33:06.551 --> 33:08.678
<i>Dylan?</i>

33:11.923 --> 33:13.788
I'm Akeelah.

33:17.895 --> 33:20.489
Javier said I can come
and join the study group today.

33:20.531 --> 33:22.999
All those rejects do that.

33:23.034 --> 33:25.264
My father coaches me privately.

33:25.303 --> 33:27.396
Who's your coach?

33:28.639 --> 33:31.870
- I don't got one.
- How many spelling bees have you won?

33:31.909 --> 33:34.377
Just the one at my school.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.216
Spell "xanthosis."

33:40.485 --> 33:43.352
<i>- Z-A...
- It starts with an X.</i>

33:43.388 --> 33:46.380
If that idiot hadn't
been caught cheating

33:46.424 --> 33:48.756
<i>you wouldn't have made the cut.</i>

33:52.630 --> 33:56.327
- "Euphoric."
- Euphoric is an adjective.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.358
Origin Greek.

33:58.403 --> 34:00.496
It means like
feeling great and everything.

34:00.538 --> 34:02.870
Either spell the word
or take a shot.

34:02.907 --> 34:06.707
<i>If you miss either one you get a strike.
Three strikes, you're out.</i>

34:08.012 --> 34:11.208
Euphoric, E-U...

34:11.248 --> 34:16.016
P-H-O-R-l-C...

34:17.088 --> 34:19.716
euphoric.
"Psoriasis."

34:19.757 --> 34:24.456
Are you taking Latin at your school?
Psoriasis is a noun, origin Greek.

34:24.495 --> 34:28.329
Are you kidding? My school barely has
enough money for kickballs.

34:28.366 --> 34:32.097
- There's no Latin classes.
- Latin helps you understand words.

34:32.136 --> 34:34.603
Psoriasis is like itchy skin.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.072
Maybe your mom could drive you
up here to take it with us.

34:37.108 --> 34:40.304
I don't know. This is all
starting to sound real heavy.

34:40.344 --> 34:43.404
It is heavy.
Spelling bees are serious shit.

34:43.447 --> 34:45.609
I think I'll take a shot.

34:53.458 --> 34:56.449
On second thought,
could I spell the word?

34:56.494 --> 34:58.621
At Crenshaw they think I'm a freak.

34:58.663 --> 35:01.723
Don't worry.
They think we're freaks here too.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.597
Hey, there's my mom.
Need a ride?

35:03.634 --> 35:07.627
Oh... naw.
My mom's gonna pick me up.

35:07.672 --> 35:09.663
She should be here soon.

35:11.142 --> 35:13.474
Hey, I'm having a birthday party
in a few weeks.

35:13.511 --> 35:15.741
You want to come?

35:15.780 --> 35:18.943
Maybe. If I can.

35:18.983 --> 35:21.178
It was cool seeing you
again, Akeelah. Bye.

35:21.219 --> 35:23.414
Bye.

35:54.785 --> 35:57.515
Where the hell have you been?

35:57.555 --> 36:01.286
- Studying.
- Studying where?

36:03.127 --> 36:05.561
- Woodland Hills.
- Woodland Hills?

36:05.596 --> 36:07.359
What you doing there?

36:08.466 --> 36:10.195
They got a spelling club.

36:10.234 --> 36:12.964
Did Mr. Welch take you?
'Cause ain't nobody call me.

36:17.508 --> 36:20.909
I went by myself. I didn't think
the bus ride would take so long.

36:20.945 --> 36:24.210
- I'm sorry.
- Akeelah Anderson!

36:24.248 --> 36:27.012
You done lost your mind?
You 11 years old.

36:27.051 --> 36:29.815
You don't be taking a bus
to Woodland Hills by yourself.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.551
- There's nobody around to take me.
- That's 'cause I work.

36:33.591 --> 36:35.616
That's what you said
on the weekend.

36:35.660 --> 36:38.527
All the other kids have
their parents at the district bee.

36:38.563 --> 36:42.055
Maybe the other kids have parents
who got more time on their hands.

36:42.099 --> 36:45.660
Look, I'm not having another child
of mine disappearing at all hours.

36:45.703 --> 36:48.934
So if this spelling thing means sneaking
off to the suburbs by yourself,

36:48.973 --> 36:51.237
- I'm calling it all off.
- We can't call it off!

36:51.275 --> 36:54.733
- I'm going to the regional bee.
- Not if you flunk out of school.

36:54.779 --> 36:57.839
I just got a letter saying you gotta
take summer school to make up

36:57.882 --> 37:01.113
- for all these classes you skipped.
- But, Mama, I hate Crenshaw!

37:01.152 --> 37:04.019
It is so boring there
and nobody cares.

37:04.055 --> 37:07.047
But you think they care about you
in Woodland Hills?

37:07.091 --> 37:08.820
At least they got Latin classes

37:08.859 --> 37:10.952
and the kids don't have to study
in their stairwells.

37:10.995 --> 37:14.761
Good for them. But until you finish
summer school at Crenshaw

37:14.799 --> 37:18.064
- ain't gonna be no more spelling bees.
- But, Mama, I got to get ready

37:18.102 --> 37:20.229
for the state bee during the summer.

37:20.271 --> 37:23.035
You just gonna have to do that
next year, now, aren't you?

37:23.074 --> 37:25.872
- But that's not fair!
- Not only is it fair,

37:25.910 --> 37:27.639
it's final.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.752
You'd let me do it.

38:08.686 --> 38:11.177
1979, maculature:

38:11.222 --> 38:14.248
M-A-C-U-L-A-T-U-R-E.
Origin is Latin.

38:14.292 --> 38:18.353
1990, fibranne:
F-l-B-R-A-N-N-E. French.

38:18.396 --> 38:22.560
1996, vivisepulture:
V-l-V-l-S-E-P-U-L-T-U-R-E.

38:23.601 --> 38:25.364
Latin.

38:25.403 --> 38:28.770
I learned all the winning words
since 1925

38:28.806 --> 38:30.774
just like you said I should.

38:32.009 --> 38:34.443
Sorry for being
so insolent last time.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.139
That's not gonna happen no more.

38:36.180 --> 38:38.171
<i>Any... more.</i>

38:38.215 --> 38:40.479
I promise.

38:40.518 --> 38:45.080
I was wondering if you might reconsider
coaching me for the state bee.

38:47.391 --> 38:49.291
'Cause I need a coach.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.659
Bad.

38:53.731 --> 38:56.723
Badly.
You need a coach badly.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.133
Come in.

39:04.275 --> 39:06.175
Come in, come in.

39:12.850 --> 39:16.149
That's a very pretty lady.
Is she your wife?

39:16.187 --> 39:19.679
Listen, you got very lucky
at the district bee.

39:19.724 --> 39:22.989
The competition at state level
is much stronger.

39:23.027 --> 39:26.588
So if you... and I were
to prepare for that,

39:26.630 --> 39:28.825
we'd have to do it on my schedule.

39:28.866 --> 39:32.358
<i>So we'd have to work three hours
each morning starting at 9:00.</i>

39:32.403 --> 39:35.600
<i>- Can you handle that?
- Well, I do have summer school.</i>

39:35.639 --> 39:38.904
But Mr. Welch said working with you
could take the place of it.

39:38.943 --> 39:43.573
Isn't that for students who don't
perform satisfactorily during the year?

39:43.614 --> 39:48.415
Well, sometimes
it's for kids want to get ahead

39:48.452 --> 39:50.886
- for next year.
- Yes, please put that down.

39:51.889 --> 39:53.686
Just... yeah.

39:57.294 --> 40:00.957
Have you...
have you got any goals?

40:00.998 --> 40:02.829
<i>- Hmm?
- Goals...</i>

40:02.867 --> 40:04.801
<i>what would you like to be
when you grow up?</i>

40:04.835 --> 40:07.929
A doctor, a lawyer,
a standup comic.

40:07.972 --> 40:12.409
I don't know. The only thing
I'm good at is spelling.

40:16.347 --> 40:18.338
Go over there

40:18.382 --> 40:21.408
and read the quotation
that's on the wall.

40:25.022 --> 40:26.717
<i>Read it aloud please.</i>

40:28.392 --> 40:32.158
"Our deepest fear is not
that we are inadequate.

40:33.197 --> 40:37.361
Our deepest fear is that we
are powerful beyond measure.

40:37.401 --> 40:39.665
We ask ourselves

40:39.703 --> 40:43.036
'Who am I to be brilliant,
gorgeous,

40:43.073 --> 40:45.633
talented and fabulous? '

40:45.676 --> 40:47.735
Actually,

40:47.778 --> 40:50.474
who are you not to be?

40:51.515 --> 40:53.710
<i>We were born to make manifest</i>

40:53.751 --> 40:56.481
<i>the glory of God that is within us.</i>

40:56.520 --> 40:58.613
And as we let our own light shine,

40:58.656 --> 41:02.422
we unconsciously give other people
permission to do the same."

41:05.529 --> 41:07.656
Does that mean anything to you?

41:09.099 --> 41:12.296
- I don't know.
- It's written in plain English.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.135
What does it mean?

41:17.074 --> 41:20.100
- That I'm not supposed to be afraid.
- Afraid of what?

41:22.880 --> 41:25.212
Afraid of...

41:27.251 --> 41:28.878
me?

41:37.561 --> 41:40.052
This national spelling bee
is a tough nut.

41:40.097 --> 41:42.361
I've seen it chew kids up
and spit them out.

41:42.399 --> 41:45.163
<i>So if you want to get there
you can't be a shrinking violet.</i>

41:45.202 --> 41:47.898
You have to stand up
and show them what you can do.

41:47.938 --> 41:50.099
All right?

41:52.076 --> 41:55.239
And I'll brook no nonsense.
You show up on time

41:55.279 --> 41:58.248
<i>with no attitude or it's over.</i>

41:58.282 --> 42:00.375
Agreed?

42:02.620 --> 42:05.145
Agreed.

42:09.560 --> 42:12.757
And baby, you should know
that you ain't...

42:12.796 --> 42:15.924
Here it is, here it is.
Stop stop stop stop.

42:15.966 --> 42:19.265
Girl, Mom would trip if she knew
we borrowed the car for this.

42:19.303 --> 42:21.669
That's why Mama
ain't gonna know.

42:23.574 --> 42:25.872
<i>Come on, Georgia.</i>

42:26.911 --> 42:29.004
Um...

42:30.614 --> 42:32.844
I'm gonna go
to the mall with Kiana.

42:32.883 --> 42:35.215
But I thought you wanted
to go to this party.

42:37.655 --> 42:39.714
Hey, Akeelah!

42:43.260 --> 42:46.058
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

42:47.498 --> 42:49.591
Come on, let's go.

42:49.633 --> 42:52.101
How are you?
Oh, thank you.

43:00.678 --> 43:03.738
<i>- Akeelah: Why'd you invite him?
- My dad's friends with his dad.</i>

43:03.781 --> 43:07.376
I'm surprised he showed up.
Hey, you want to see my house?

43:07.418 --> 43:09.613
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

43:09.653 --> 43:12.451
This is my father's office.

43:12.489 --> 43:15.925
He's a journalist and he's written
like a bunch of books.

43:17.161 --> 43:20.153
What's your father do?

43:20.197 --> 43:22.597
My daddy...

43:22.633 --> 43:24.931
he used to work
for the city parks.

43:26.770 --> 43:29.500
Man, you got a lot of friends.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.804
I never had
a birthday party this big.

43:31.842 --> 43:33.742
I'd think you'd have
lots of friends.

43:39.717 --> 43:42.880
- Why'd you do that?
- I had an impulse.

43:44.154 --> 43:46.782
Are you gonna sue me
for sexual harassment?

43:50.094 --> 43:52.187
(both laughing)

43:52.229 --> 43:54.925
That was fun.

43:54.965 --> 43:56.694
What are they doing down there?

43:56.734 --> 43:59.601
<i>Javier: Oh no, Dylan brought
his Scrabble games.</i>

43:59.637 --> 44:01.298
Scrabble?

44:01.338 --> 44:04.171
<i>Dylan:
I get 30 seconds for each board.</i>

44:04.208 --> 44:07.109
We need one more.
Who wants to play?

44:07.144 --> 44:09.339
I will.

44:14.885 --> 44:17.285
<i>Javier: And right out of the gate,
Roman scores 32 points</i>

44:17.321 --> 44:19.687
with "birch" on
the double-word score.

44:19.723 --> 44:23.955
Dylan counters with the immediate
use of Z for 39 big ones.

44:24.962 --> 44:27.453
<i>Polly tests the water
with "acorn."</i>

44:28.565 --> 44:31.898
<i>And Dylan answers with a body blow:
"Beacon" for 20.</i>

44:33.604 --> 44:36.004
<i>Holy cannoli.</i>

44:37.875 --> 44:41.174
<i>Right off the bat,
Akeelah uses all her letters</i>

44:41.211 --> 44:43.202
getting 50 extra points

44:43.247 --> 44:46.216
for a whopping 82.

44:47.351 --> 44:49.319
What will Dylan do?

44:49.353 --> 44:51.719
He's fighting the clock.

44:51.755 --> 44:54.246
You could cut
the tension with a butter knife.

44:54.291 --> 44:56.816
Shut up.

45:04.268 --> 45:05.895
Shazam!

45:05.936 --> 45:09.372
Dylan gets
his own bingo for 76 points.

45:16.980 --> 45:20.711
It's come down to this.
After having crushed all five opponents,

45:20.751 --> 45:22.844
Dylan has only Akeelah to beat.

45:22.886 --> 45:26.287
But she's ahead by 21
and has only a few letters left.

45:26.323 --> 45:28.518
Is this an upset in the making?

45:28.559 --> 45:30.754
What kind of birthday party is this?

45:39.837 --> 45:43.773
Yowza! Using the triple word score,
Dylan charges ahead by six.

45:50.981 --> 45:52.949
Just go.

46:03.127 --> 46:06.927
Booyah! Akeelah's in the lead by
12 points and had only one letter left.

46:06.964 --> 46:09.558
<i>But this could be Dylan's final play.</i>

46:16.006 --> 46:18.270
Arrivederci, sweetheart.

46:21.445 --> 46:23.777
12 points ties the game,

46:23.814 --> 46:26.112
but Dylan gets
Akeelah's last two points.

46:26.150 --> 46:29.415
<i>He wins a heartbreaker.</i>

46:31.655 --> 46:34.818
Wow, Akeelah. No one ever
gets that close to beating Dylan.

46:34.858 --> 46:36.826
But I didn't beat him.

46:38.162 --> 46:41.461
Girl, you passed up the mall
to play Scrabble?

46:44.902 --> 46:46.927
<i>Dylan:
She just got lucky.</i>

46:46.970 --> 46:50.906
<i>Father: If you can barely beat a little
black girl at a silly board game,</i>

46:50.941 --> 46:53.341
how do you expect
to win the national bee?

46:55.412 --> 46:57.471
Listen!

46:57.514 --> 47:00.347
We're not coming in second
again this year.

47:00.384 --> 47:03.182
<i>We're going to win.</i>

47:03.220 --> 47:05.586
Let's go.

47:09.393 --> 47:11.190
<i>Akeelah:
"He began to have a dim feeling</i>

47:11.228 --> 47:13.458
that to attain his place in the world

47:13.497 --> 47:16.227
he must be himself
and not another."

47:16.266 --> 47:19.463
Dr. Larabee,
this book is too heavy.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.994
Good. It'll develop
your arm muscles.

47:22.039 --> 47:24.166
I thought we were developing
my vocabulary.

47:24.208 --> 47:26.108
We are.
Please continue reading.

47:26.143 --> 47:28.703
But I already know most
of the words in this speech.

47:28.745 --> 47:31.077
It's not a speech.
It's an essay.

47:31.114 --> 47:33.378
By WEB DuBois,
the first black man

47:33.417 --> 47:35.749
to receive a PhD
from Harvard University.

47:35.786 --> 47:37.913
Maybe we should be
studying more big words.

47:37.955 --> 47:43.621
- Spell "cabalistic."
- C-A-B-A-L-l-S-T-l-C,

47:43.660 --> 47:46.185
- cabalistic.
- And when did you learn that one?

47:46.230 --> 47:48.664
About two minutes ago
in this book.

47:48.699 --> 47:51.395
But in the time it took
to learn that one word,

47:51.435 --> 47:53.562
Dylan probably learned 20.

47:53.604 --> 47:56.038
And those 20 words
won't mean anything to him.

47:56.073 --> 48:00.032
He's just a little robot
memorizing lists of words.

48:00.077 --> 48:03.342
The people we are studying:
DuBois, Dr. King, JFK,

48:03.380 --> 48:05.905
these people used words
to change the world.

48:05.949 --> 48:08.645
...the world...
- And they didn't acquire

48:08.685 --> 48:11.518
their vocabulary
by rote memorization.

48:12.656 --> 48:16.558
Okay.
But when I'm at the bee,

48:16.593 --> 48:19.721
and they tell me to spell some
little fish from Australia

48:19.763 --> 48:22.163
or some weird bacteria
on the moon,

48:22.199 --> 48:25.635
we're gonna wish we'd done
a little bit more rote memorizing

48:25.669 --> 48:27.762
and not so much essay reading...

48:28.805 --> 48:31.103
if you don't mind me saying.

48:33.377 --> 48:36.244
Bacteria don't exist on the moon.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.748
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

48:38.782 --> 48:41.148
Where do you think
big words come from?

48:41.184 --> 48:43.812
People with big brains.

48:46.223 --> 48:49.784
All right, what do you see?

48:49.826 --> 48:51.760
A bunch of big words
I don't know.

48:51.795 --> 48:53.922
Ah, look again.

48:55.866 --> 48:57.891
What kind of power
do we get from the sun?

48:57.935 --> 49:01.234
- Solar.
- So what does "sol" mean?

49:01.271 --> 49:04.468
- Sun.
- What does "terraneous" sound like?

49:04.508 --> 49:06.567
- Terrain.
- Meaning the earth.

49:06.610 --> 49:10.512
"Soliterraneous" means
the sun and the earth

49:10.547 --> 49:13.914
working together.
So where do big words come from?

49:13.951 --> 49:16.886
- Little words.
- And how many little words do you know?

49:16.920 --> 49:18.945
- Tons.
- Yes!

49:18.989 --> 49:21.116
And there are tons more
for you to learn.

49:21.158 --> 49:22.989
There are Greek ones.

49:23.026 --> 49:25.824
There are Latin ones.

49:25.862 --> 49:30.595
French ones.
And if you learn them all,

49:30.634 --> 49:33.296
you can spell any word,
no matter how big.

49:36.673 --> 49:39.164
Maybe we should get back
to the essay reading.

49:39.209 --> 49:42.201
What's the matter?
I thought you wanted to...

49:42.245 --> 49:44.839
win the national spelling bee.

49:44.881 --> 49:48.009
Maybe just getting there
this time is good enough.

49:48.051 --> 49:50.952
Don't give me that.

49:50.988 --> 49:53.548
You want to win it so badly

49:53.590 --> 49:55.956
it keeps you up at night.

49:55.993 --> 49:59.429
Ever since you found out there was such
a thing as the national spelling bee

49:59.463 --> 50:01.795
you've seen yourself
holding up that trophy,

50:01.832 --> 50:04.198
but if you can't say it,
you can't win it. So say it.

50:04.234 --> 50:06.998
- I want to win.
- Say it louder please.

50:07.037 --> 50:09.028
- I want to win.
- You want to win what?

50:09.072 --> 50:11.870
I want to win
the national spelling bee!

50:11.908 --> 50:15.344
Good. Good.

50:15.379 --> 50:18.007
You'll win using my methods.

50:18.048 --> 50:20.881
By first understanding
the power of language,

50:20.917 --> 50:23.215
then by deconstructing it,

50:23.253 --> 50:26.279
breaking it down to its origins,
to its roots,

50:26.323 --> 50:28.814
you'll consume it.
You will own it.

50:28.859 --> 50:31.350
And then you know
what you'll be?

50:31.395 --> 50:33.659
Mm-hmm.
Tired.

50:33.697 --> 50:35.858
You'll be a champion.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.893
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

50:39.936 --> 50:41.767
All right, let's go.

50:41.805 --> 50:44.273
<i>Hand me down
my walking cane</i>

50:44.307 --> 50:46.332
<i>Hand me down my hat</i>

50:46.376 --> 50:49.072
<i>Hurry now and don't be late</i>

50:49.112 --> 50:51.546
<i>'Cause we ain't got time to chat</i>

50:51.581 --> 50:53.572
<i>You and me, we're going out</i>

50:53.617 --> 50:56.450
<i>To catch the latest sounds</i>

50:56.486 --> 50:58.852
<i>Guaranteed to blow your mind</i>

50:58.889 --> 51:01.619
<i>So high you won't come down</i>

51:01.658 --> 51:03.819
<i>Hey, y'all prepare yourself</i>

51:03.860 --> 51:06.727
<i>For the rubberband man</i>

51:06.763 --> 51:08.754
<i>You never heard a sound</i>

51:08.799 --> 51:11.563
<i>Like the rubberband man</i>

51:11.601 --> 51:13.592
<i>You're bound to lose control</i>

51:13.637 --> 51:16.629
<i>When the rubberband
starts to jam</i>

51:18.608 --> 51:21.076
<i>Oh Lord, this dude
is out of sight</i>

51:21.111 --> 51:23.841
<i>Everything he does</i>

51:23.880 --> 51:26.405
<i>Seems to come out right</i>

51:26.450 --> 51:28.384
<i>Once I went to hear them play</i>

51:28.418 --> 51:30.613
<i>At a club outside of town</i>

51:30.654 --> 51:33.350
<i>I was so surprised,
I was hypnotized...</i>

51:33.390 --> 51:35.381
(speaking Latin)

51:42.866 --> 51:44.925
Um, why are you home so early?

51:44.968 --> 51:47.232
Just wasn't feeling well.

51:48.772 --> 51:50.740
What you got there?

51:51.741 --> 51:53.140
Homework.

51:56.513 --> 51:58.845
You know, the regional bee
is coming up soon

51:58.882 --> 52:00.873
and I was wondering
if you might want...

52:00.917 --> 52:02.908
Is that gonna happen
in Beverly Hills too?

52:02.953 --> 52:05.581
- I don't know.
- I told you,

52:05.622 --> 52:08.887
you pass summer school then you can
start worrying about the spelling bee.

52:08.925 --> 52:11.291
- But if you would...
- Akeelah.

52:11.328 --> 52:13.922
Baby, I'm just not
in the mood, all right?

52:26.810 --> 52:28.971
So how come
you don't teach anymore?

52:29.012 --> 52:32.004
I told you I do teach. L...

52:32.048 --> 52:34.516
I administer classes online.

52:34.551 --> 52:37.349
Let's keep going.

52:37.387 --> 52:40.356
- "Effervescent."
- E-F-F...

52:40.390 --> 52:41.755
<i>(dog barking)</i>

52:41.791 --> 52:43.884
E-R-V-E...

52:47.364 --> 52:48.592
S-E-N-T,

52:48.632 --> 52:50.725
- effervescent.
- Come on, you know this word.

52:50.767 --> 52:52.632
That dog's distracting me.

52:52.669 --> 52:54.933
You're gonna have
much bigger distractions

52:54.971 --> 52:56.996
when you get
to the national bee in DC.

52:57.040 --> 52:59.235
<i>Now what is that
you're doing with your hand, hmm?</i>

52:59.276 --> 53:01.107
What?

53:01.144 --> 53:03.305
With your hand, your hand?

53:03.346 --> 53:04.904
You... you... you...

53:04.948 --> 53:07.644
- you tap, like that. What is that?
- I don't know.

53:15.859 --> 53:18.020
(coughs)

53:18.061 --> 53:20.120
So why do you got
all these toys for?

53:21.164 --> 53:23.428
They belonged to my niece.

53:23.466 --> 53:26.128
Oh. So you got
any kids of your own?

53:26.169 --> 53:28.569
You ask a lot
of questions, don't you?

53:28.605 --> 53:30.732
I'm naturally inquisitive.

53:30.774 --> 53:33.106
Which is also sometimes confused

53:33.143 --> 53:36.442
with being naturally obnoxious.
Here.

53:36.479 --> 53:38.413
Let me see you jump rope.

53:38.448 --> 53:41.349
- Just jump?
- Yes, just jump.

53:49.326 --> 53:51.556
Is there a point to this?

53:56.566 --> 53:58.466
Yes, there is.
Keep going.

54:03.940 --> 54:06.272
I said keep going.

54:06.309 --> 54:08.209
Concentrate.
Stay focused.

54:08.245 --> 54:11.237
<i>Spell effervescent. Don't think
about anything else. Come on.</i>

54:11.281 --> 54:12.646
Go.

54:12.682 --> 54:15.617
E-F-F-E...

54:15.652 --> 54:18.712
- R-V-E-S...
- Good!

54:18.755 --> 54:21.849
C-E-N-T,

54:21.891 --> 54:24.951
- effervescent.
- You see that? That's your trick.

54:24.995 --> 54:27.896
- That's your mnemonic device.
- Jumping rope?

54:27.931 --> 54:29.956
Keeping time, keeping time.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.468
You see kids at the bee...
they do all kinds of things.

54:32.502 --> 54:35.096
They... they sway back and forth.
They...

54:35.138 --> 54:37.299
turn around,
turn around in circles.

54:37.340 --> 54:39.831
Anything they have to do
to stay focused.

54:39.876 --> 54:42.674
You keep time.
And I bet you

54:42.712 --> 54:45.146
if you learned the words
while you kept time

54:45.181 --> 54:49.117
you would remember them
even better.

54:50.287 --> 54:53.552
...L- U-N-l-Z-E.

54:53.590 --> 54:55.524
"Quamdiu."

54:55.558 --> 55:00.621
- Q-U-A-M-D-l-U.
- Good.

55:00.664 --> 55:02.154
Cognizant.

55:02.198 --> 55:04.063
C-O-G-

55:04.100 --> 55:07.536
N-l-Z-A-N-T.

55:07.570 --> 55:09.128
Correct. "Tzigane."

55:09.172 --> 55:13.905
T-Z-l-G-A-N-E.

55:13.943 --> 55:15.205
Correct.

55:24.421 --> 55:26.946
It's too bad your mother had
to work today, Akeelah.

55:26.990 --> 55:28.753
Did she get to see the new dress?

55:28.792 --> 55:32.228
Uh, yeah. She thought it was cool.
Oh, there goes Javier.

55:32.262 --> 55:34.492
<i>Woman:
This is a very exciting day for us here</i>

55:34.531 --> 55:38.524
because our top three spellers will be
representing Southern California

55:38.568 --> 55:42.902
at the national spelling bee
in Washington DC.

55:42.939 --> 55:44.304
Yes!

55:46.309 --> 55:48.800
<i>So what do you say?
Let's spell!</i>

55:48.845 --> 55:51.678
Well, Josh, you think
she's got a shot at it?

55:51.715 --> 55:53.706
We'll see.

55:54.751 --> 55:58.812
- "Alfresco."
- A-L-F-R-E-S-C-O,

55:58.855 --> 56:01.380
<i>- alfresco.
- That's correct.</i>

56:03.593 --> 56:06.027
- Loquacious.
- (bell rings)

56:06.062 --> 56:07.893
<i>- Espadrille.
- (bell rings)</i>

56:07.931 --> 56:10.297
<i>- Jambalaya.
- (bell rings)</i>

56:11.568 --> 56:13.399
Could you repeat
the word, please?

56:13.436 --> 56:15.336
Malloseismic.

56:16.639 --> 56:18.539
M...

56:18.575 --> 56:20.873
A-L...

56:20.910 --> 56:23.037
<i>O...</i>

56:23.079 --> 56:25.206
<i>S- E...</i>

56:25.248 --> 56:27.409
l-S-M-l-C.

56:27.450 --> 56:29.384
(bell rings)

56:29.419 --> 56:31.580
<i>Malloseismic is...</i>

56:31.621 --> 56:33.521
M-A-L-L...

56:33.556 --> 56:37.617
<i>O- S-E-l-S-M-l-C.</i>

56:38.661 --> 56:40.720
It's all right.
It's all right.

56:43.666 --> 56:47.932
<i>Boy:
D- O-U-B-L-U-R-E.</i>

56:47.971 --> 56:50.462
<i>That's correct.</i>

56:55.245 --> 56:57.145
"Psalmody."

56:57.180 --> 56:59.478
<i>Akeelah:
Definition please.</i>

56:59.516 --> 57:03.213
<i>- Psalmody means the practice...
- Mrs. Anderson.</i>

57:03.253 --> 57:05.050
<i>... or art of of singing in psalms.</i>

57:05.088 --> 57:07.249
I want my daughter
off that stage right now.

57:08.324 --> 57:10.292
P-S-A...

57:10.326 --> 57:13.921
I don't care what she said.
I want her off that stage.

57:13.963 --> 57:16.158
<i>I didn't know she was here
and I didn't give her permission...</i>

57:16.199 --> 57:18.963
<i>- L-M-O...
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Anderson.</i>

57:19.002 --> 57:22.233
No, I told her she was
expressly not to be here.

57:22.272 --> 57:25.264
<i>And you don't take my child anywhere
without my permission.</i>

57:25.308 --> 57:27.799
D-Y, psalmody.

57:29.012 --> 57:32.607
That's correct.

57:32.649 --> 57:35.083
<i>All right, next please.</i>

57:35.118 --> 57:37.177
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

57:37.220 --> 57:40.246
The mother of one of the spellers
needs to speak with her.

57:40.290 --> 57:42.258
- It's rather urgent.
- Um...

57:42.292 --> 57:45.022
Okay, but she must be
back on the stage

57:45.061 --> 57:47.586
<i>before her next turn
or she'll be disqualified.</i>

57:47.630 --> 57:50.121
She'll be back.

58:05.048 --> 58:08.142
I swear we thought you were on board
with this, Mrs. Anderson.

58:08.184 --> 58:10.482
You want to tell me
what the heck is going on here?

58:10.520 --> 58:12.784
<i>Because I never signed
a consent form.</i>

58:14.057 --> 58:16.958
- I signed Daddy's name.
- You did what?!

58:20.029 --> 58:22.361
How do you think I felt

58:22.398 --> 58:25.799
when Javier's mother calls me
to see if I need a ride to USC?

58:25.835 --> 58:28.429
I don't know who she is
or what she's talking about.

58:28.471 --> 58:31.634
I'm sorry, Mama.
I just wanted to do the bee.

58:31.674 --> 58:35.303
By lying? By going behind
my back for the last six months?

58:35.345 --> 58:38.007
<i>You might as well say goodbye
to your little friends, Akeelah,</i>

58:38.047 --> 58:40.038
because this is your last
spelling bee.

58:40.083 --> 58:42.551
I beg you, Mrs. Anderson,
to reconsider this.

58:42.585 --> 58:44.644
- She deserves this opport...
- Bob.

58:44.687 --> 58:47.349
Mrs. Anderson's right.

58:47.390 --> 58:50.223
Akeelah does not deserve to go
to the bee this year.

58:50.260 --> 58:52.524
What?

58:52.562 --> 58:54.757
Next speller please.

58:56.132 --> 58:58.999
<i>Come on up to the mike please.</i>

59:03.406 --> 59:06.773
<i>A little faster. Come on.</i>

59:10.146 --> 59:12.080
I apologize, Mrs. Anderson,

59:12.115 --> 59:15.175
if we've contributed to any anguish
you may be feeling.

59:15.218 --> 59:17.083
And who are you exactly?

59:17.120 --> 59:19.350
My name is Joshua Larabee, ma'am.

59:19.389 --> 59:22.085
And I've been...
well, I've been helping Akeelah

59:22.125 --> 59:24.685
prepare herself
for the spelling bee.

59:24.727 --> 59:28.993
Akeelah's been getting extra school
credit for working with Dr. Larabee.

59:29.032 --> 59:32.490
We designed an entire program
specifically for her.

59:32.535 --> 59:34.867
Why didn't you tell me about this?

59:34.904 --> 59:37.600
Mama, I hated going
behind your back,

59:37.640 --> 59:41.098
but every time I brought up the bee,
you didn't want to hear it.

59:42.512 --> 59:44.742
I didn't know what to do.

59:46.282 --> 59:48.216
Can I get the pronunciation again?

59:48.251 --> 59:52.813
He's given it to you five times.
You need to spell the word.

59:52.855 --> 59:55.085
Could you use it in a sentence?

59:55.124 --> 59:57.991
He's already used it in a sentence.

59:58.027 --> 01:00:00.894
I mean a different sentence
than you used before.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:04.832
- You only get one sentence.
- What's up with this kid?

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:11.196
You must want this thing pretty bad
because you ain't

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.834
never lied to me before in your life.

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:15.867
So maybe you can tell me
what you think

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:18.574
a good punishment would be
for what you did.

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:26.152
- I guess I gotta miss the bee.
- But that don't just punish you.

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:29.488
Mr. Welch and Dr. Larabee done put
a lot of time into this too.

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:31.891
So you think of something else.

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:38.256
Maybe double chores
for the month.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:41.099
For the next three months.

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:45.367
She still got time to get
back up on that stage?

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:49.704
If we move very quickly, yes.

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.941
Well, I guess you'd
better get a move on.

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:58.482
We haven't much time.

01:00:58.521 --> 01:01:00.318
Come on, come on.

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:05.290
Thank you, Mama.

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:08.388
All right.

01:01:11.267 --> 01:01:14.566
- Dr. Larabee, is it?
- Yes.

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:17.732
So you actually think
Akeelah has a chance

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:20.140
<i>to win the national spelling bee?</i>

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.973
Yes.

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:23.911
Yes, I think she does.

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:28.413
Well...

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:31.511
- could you use it in a song?
- What?

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:39.257
Never mind. Ratatouille:
R-A-T-A-T-O-U-l-L-L-E, ratatouille.

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:41.354
Uh... that's correct.

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:44.491
- Where's number 73, please?
- She's here, she's here.

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.468
<i>Number 7 3.</i>

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:53.071
- Thank you.
- I was about to start tap dancing.

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:58.178
<i>Man:
Okay, "pluviosity."</i>

01:01:58.214 --> 01:02:00.205
Can I get a definition please?

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:04.879
<i>Pluviosity means a state
characterized by much rain.</i>

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:14.663
Pluviosity:

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:20.101
P-L-U-V-l-O-S-l-T-Y,

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:22.730
- pluviosity.
- That's correct.

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:24.205
Thank you.

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:33.282
<i>R- E-S-P-E-C-T</i>

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:35.307
<i>Find out what it means to me</i>

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:37.478
<i>R- E-S-P-E-C-T</i>

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.454
<i>Take care, TCB</i>

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.787
<i>Oh, a little respect...</i>

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:45.351
I'd like to thank you all
for coming out today

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:48.989
to honor our own
Akeelah Anderson!

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.833
(groans)

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:57.838
Um...

01:02:57.874 --> 01:03:01.105
thanks...

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:03.203
a lot.

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:10.149
Oh girl, you like
a movie star now.

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:12.484
I know.
It's pretty crazy.

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:15.457
Hey, my mama said she want
to take us out to celebrate tonight.

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:19.024
Javier's parents are taking me out.

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:21.461
- But maybe we can...
- Akeelah, excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:23.795
There's a reporter here
and she wants to talk to you.

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:26.495
- I don't want to talk to no reporter.
- Are you kidding?

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:29.596
This is exactly the kind of
good publicity Crenshaw needs.

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:32.199
Excuse us! Sorry.

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:36.535
<i>Hi, this is Lauren Sanchez
reporting from South Los Angeles.</i>

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:39.013
I'm here with 11-year-old
Akeelah Anderson.

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:41.414
<i>She's a seventh grader
from Crenshaw Middle School</i>

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:44.214
who's heading to the national
spelling bee. How does it feel

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:46.517
<i>now that you're going to be going
to Washington DC?</i>

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:48.183
<i>- It's pretty cool.
- Are you excited?</i>

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:50.886
<i>All right, let's check out the word
that Akeelah spelled</i>

01:03:50.927 --> 01:03:53.987
<i>here at the Southern California finals
that got her to the national bee.</i>

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:57.693
<i>Erythrocyte: E-R-Y...</i>

01:03:57.733 --> 01:03:59.724
<i>(turns off TV)</i>

01:04:08.377 --> 01:04:11.244
<i>- Joshua: Spell, "affenpinscher."
- Affen-what?</i>

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.872
"Grallatorial."

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:16.282
<i>- G-R-A-L-A-T...
- Wrong.</i>

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:19.117
- "Jacquard."
- Dr. Larabee.

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:20.884
Spell the word jacquard.

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:26.091
- J-A-Q-U...
- What about the C?

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:30.258
These are all words that were missed
in last year's national spelling bee.

01:04:30.299 --> 01:04:33.063
- And you can't spell one of them.
- Maybe because we haven't

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:35.366
- studied them yet.
- Why did you cancel yesterday?

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.304
Hmm?
Were you doing another interview,

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.570
flaunting yourself in front
of the television cameras?

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:42.339
No, I was at the mall.

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:45.905
Look, I wasn't dissing you.
I was Christmas shopping.

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:48.439
"Dissing"? I thought we didn't
use words like that.

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:51.749
I thought we only used words
from the dictionary in here.

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:03.464
"Dis, dissed, dissing:
To treat with disrespect

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:05.433
<i>or contempt;
to find fault with. "</i>

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:08.733
New words get added
to the dictionary every year.

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:18.780
Look, I didn't get
to the national bee

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:21.112
until I was 14 years old.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:23.448
I had no help.
I had no training.

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:25.454
I had nothing.

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:27.718
By the time I got
to the third round, I was out.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:31.318
<i>You have an opportunity</i>

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.487
to win this thing.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:38.893
But all we've done
for eight months

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:42.268
is study words.
Why can't we take a break,

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:46.071
go to a movie, to a basketball game?
Why can't we have fun?

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:49.373
I told you, Denise,
you can have fun after the bee.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.848
Who's Denise?

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:56.215
What?

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:58.311
Denise, you called me Denise.
Who's that?

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:04.122
Dr. Larabee, are you okay?

01:06:06.929 --> 01:06:09.193
Yes.

01:06:09.231 --> 01:06:11.665
Yes, I'm fine.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:17.997
Listen, I spent all last week

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.099
making these for you.

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:22.508
<i>- What are they?
- They're flash cards.</i>

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:26.140
5,000 new words, the types
that you will run into at the finals.

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:29.447
5,000? But we've only
got a few months left.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:32.079
- What, you going to coach me 24-7?
- Uh, no...

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:35.022
you're going to, um,
learn these on your own.

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:39.352
There's nothing left
for me to teach you.

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:43.830
What?

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:48.133
You... you've got it all, Akeelah.
You've got word construction down

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.934
etymology,
memorization techniques.

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:53.703
<i>What you need to do now is just</i>

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:56.644
focus on the words.

01:06:56.679 --> 01:07:00.979
I can't learn 5,000 new words
all by myself.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.485
Oh, yes, you can.
You've got a brain like a sponge.

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:07.319
- You just sit down and you study them.
- Dr. Larabee, I swear, I promise...

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:11.156
<i>I won't miss any more sessions
and I'll do whatever you say.</i>

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:13.252
You can't stop coaching me now.

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:17.061
I told Mr. Welch I'd get you through
the regionals and I've done that.

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:19.533
Now, I don't have anything else
I can teach you.

01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:22.162
<i>You need to just
take those words</i>

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.399
and study them
and you'll be all right.

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:38.185
This is why I was at the mall.

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:43.783
Merry Christmas.

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:55.326
<i>(door shuts)</i>

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:58.830
<i>(pop music playing)</i>

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:02.833
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:04.937
<i>- Georgia: Hello?
- Akeelah: Hey, girl.</i>

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:08.814
<i>- What you doin'?
- Watching TV.</i>

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:12.446
You want to go skating
this weekend?

01:08:12.488 --> 01:08:15.582
<i>Why don't you go with your friends
from Woodland Hills?</i>

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:19.116
What?
Girl, what's wrong with you?

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:21.459
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:24.193
<i>I got homework to do.
I'll see you later.</i>

01:08:29.537 --> 01:08:31.768
<i>Kiana:
Hey, Keelie!</i>

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:34.367
<i>Keelie, come on out here!</i>

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:36.344
<i>Girl, you on TV.</i>

01:08:36.377 --> 01:08:38.743
<i>- Hurry. Come on, look!
- Akeelah Anderson's rise</i>

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:42.740
has captivated her community.
All of Los Angeles is talking about her.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.117
If she wins this spelling bee
it's going to be like

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:48.920
<i>- everybody in the neighborhood wins.
- I think it'll be real positive.</i>

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:51.551
<i>You know...
good for the community.</i>

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:54.085
I'm already studying
for next year's bee.

01:08:58.667 --> 01:08:59.792
What is wrong with...

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:02.531
Akeelah, what's wrong?

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:05.540
- I don't want to do the bee no more.
- You don't want to do the bee?

01:09:05.573 --> 01:09:08.542
- Why not?
- Dr. Larabee don't want

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:11.978
to coach me no more,
Georgia don't want to hang out with me

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:15.643
and all these people are
expecting me to win.

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:20.053
And it's just too hard, Mama.
I want it all to stop.

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:22.023
- Baby, you worked so...
- Please.

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:24.821
- Please.
- All right, all right.

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:37.630
I certainly didn't mean
to upset her. L...

01:09:39.774 --> 01:09:42.038
well, I honestly thought I was

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:44.636
doing the best thing for her.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.022
You know, Dr. Larabee,

01:09:57.059 --> 01:10:00.222
my child is only 11 years old

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:04.255
and she has been through
so much already.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.325
Her father was killed
when she was six.

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:09.769
Somebody shot him
on his way home from work.

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:13.366
Do you have any idea what it's like
for a girl to lose her father that way?

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:20.074
I can imagine.

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:23.744
Then why do you want
to cause this child any more grief?

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:26.448
That's an unfair accusation,
Mrs. Anderson.

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:29.013
As I've told you, I'm...

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.492
I'm just not in a place
where I can

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:34.394
be of any more help
to Akeelah right now.

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:37.422
But she needs you.
She does.

01:10:37.466 --> 01:10:40.902
I beg to differ, Mrs. Anderson.
It's not me that Akeelah needs.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:47.703
<i>Girl on TV:I remember when he used
to take us out to the ballgames,</i>

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:51.474
<i>and take us to the movies
and we'd have popcorn fights.</i>

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:54.175
<i>Woman on TV:
We'll do that again.</i>

01:10:54.216 --> 01:10:56.446
<i>Sure.</i>

01:10:56.485 --> 01:10:59.113
I want to tell you something.

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:05.151
You know why I didn't want you
to do the bee at first?

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.121
'Cause I saw that video of yours

01:11:09.164 --> 01:11:12.531
and I saw one winner
and 200 losers.

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:15.230
And I didn't want you to be
one of those losers.

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:19.273
Did you know your mama

01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:22.300
went to college
right after high school?

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:24.175
No.

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:26.704
I had a scholarship.

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:29.149
I was gonna be a doctor.

01:11:30.853 --> 01:11:32.582
What happened?

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:38.787
I just felt so out of place
at that school.

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:42.553
I convinced myself

01:11:42.598 --> 01:11:45.192
that I was gonna fail.

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:48.670
So before that could happen,
I dropped out.

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:53.798
I don't want you to do
the same thing with this bee.

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:08.246
"Gabbro,"

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:12.522
a group of dark heavy rocks.

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:16.921
Can you spell it for me?

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:22.398
G-A-B-R-O,

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:24.065
gabbro?

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:26.870
Actually it's got two Bs.

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:34.305
You know, Akeelah, you ain't short
on people who want to help you.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:39.219
I bet if you just look around,
you got 50,000 coaches.

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:42.747
Starting with me.

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:47.223
- Mama?
- Hmm?

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:49.696
You think that maybe

01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:52.292
you might go back to college?

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.538
I just might.

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:02.777
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:04.506
I love you too.

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:08.676
"Craquelure,"
C-R-A-Q-U-E-L-U...

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:11.845
Hey, yo, so why y'all punking out
on the spelling bee, huh?

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:14.082
What, you afraid of all
the suburbia kids now?

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:16.250
No.

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:18.951
Hey!

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:20.928
So how you spell
all these words anyway?

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:23.659
- I study them.
- Whatever.

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:26.327
There go my ride.

01:13:26.368 --> 01:13:29.030
- Hey, what up, Derrick-T?
- What up, Terrence?

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.868
Who dat?

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:33.898
That ain't nobody,
just my little sister.

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:35.842
What up, little thing?

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:40.042
I been seeing you on TV.
Trying to win some big contest, huh?

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.277
Answer the man.

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:44.410
<i>You know, I won something once...</i>

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:47.718
fifth grade.
I wrote a poem.

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:50.884
Even got myself
a blue ribbon too.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.088
- Yeah, good. You wrote yourself a poem.
- Shut up, dawg.

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:58.122
What you think rap is?

01:13:58.167 --> 01:14:02.194
- What's that in your hand?
- Ain't nothin', just some stupid word.

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:05.798
- You helping her?
- Naw, man, I'm chilling wit you, right?

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:13.615
Naw, man.

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:17.785
- Stay here and help your sis.
- Why?

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.788
'Cause I say so.

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:21.813
Let's break out, man.

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:27.789
- Derrick-T!
- What's up?

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:31.365
I want to read your poem.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.891
After you win the contest.

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:35.836
Let's go, man.

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:42.934
You ain't gotta help me
if you don't want to.

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:48.780
"En-fran-chis-ment"?

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:52.480
- You mean enfranchisement?
- Hey, whatever.

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:55.354
Can you spell it?

01:14:57.926 --> 01:15:01.794
50,000 coaches.

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:06.401
E-N-F-R...

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:08.596
<i>Wake up, everybody</i>

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:11.538
<i>No more sleeping in bed</i>

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:14.007
<i>No more backward thinking</i>

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:16.840
<i>Time for thinking ahead</i>

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:19.473
<i>The world has changed
so very much</i>

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:21.278
<i>From what it used to be...</i>

01:15:21.316 --> 01:15:23.216
"Ap-teery-goat-ti."

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:25.220
- What?
- That right there.

01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:28.746
Apterygote. Maybe you
shouldn't show me the cards.

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:30.451
Oh yeah. Sorry.

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.193
<i>Wake up all the teachers</i>

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:39.860
<i>Time to teach a new way</i>

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:42.336
<i>Maybe then they'll listen</i>

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:44.862
<i>To what you have to say</i>

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:47.398
<i>'Cause they're the ones
who's coming up</i>

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:50.070
<i>And the world
is in their hands</i>

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:52.273
<i>When you teach the children</i>

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:55.841
<i>Teach them
the very best you can...</i>

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:58.250
...R- E-S-A...

01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:01.051
You go, Akeelah, baby!
Make us proud!

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:29.779
5,000, I learned them all.

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:33.379
But I had some help.

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:36.289
You should be
very well prepared then.

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:40.227
You know, Dr. Larabee,

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:42.992
when I was a little girl...

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:46.694
my daddy died.

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:53.468
I used to cry all the time.

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:57.341
But then...

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:01.377
I found something that helped.

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:03.611
What was that?

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:06.746
I spelled... over and over again.

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:08.585
And I'd feel better.

01:17:12.327 --> 01:17:14.989
Maybe when you're
thinking of her...

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:18.965
you can try spelling.

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:21.469
It might help.

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:38.611
Akeelah?

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:44.850
- Who told you?
- You did.

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:47.995
You called me
by her name: Denise.

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:57.801
That's her jump rope, isn't it?

01:17:57.839 --> 01:18:00.467
Yes.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:05.002
Was she your little girl?

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:12.077
Yes.

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:16.784
What happened to her?

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:28.129
She got very sick.

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:31.628
She was only a couple of years

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:34.164
younger than you
when she passed.

01:18:39.481 --> 01:18:42.575
Where is her mama?

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:46.417
She moved to another city and...

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:50.516
after it happened

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:53.084
my wife...

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:55.995
Patricia and I

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:58.932
found it...

01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:02.737
slowly

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:05.137
became very

01:19:05.173 --> 01:19:07.471
difficult to be...

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:19.119
Anyway, this is...

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:21.418
this is Patricia's garden.

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:28.756
You see, I need...
I need a lot of order in my life.

01:19:28.797 --> 01:19:32.358
That's why I don't teach
in the classrooms anymore.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.631
It's just too unpredictable.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:38.740
<i>Like you.</i>

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.504
This whole spelling bee business
now has become...

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:45.512
a little too unpredictable as well.

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:52.276
Dr. Larabee...

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:57.789
l... I can't go to DC without you.

01:19:57.826 --> 01:20:00.420
Yes, you can, Akeelah.
You can do anything you want.

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:03.022
<i>- I can't beat Dylan.
- Don't say that.</i>

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:06.329
It's true. It doesn't matter
how many words I learn.

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:08.336
He'll always know more.

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:11.066
Let me tell you about Dylan.

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:15.877
There's only one person
who can push him

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:19.176
to spell as well as he possibly can.

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:23.048
It's not his dad.
It's not the spelling bee people.

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:25.211
It's not even himself.

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:27.983
That person is you.

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:31.356
So...

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:34.453
when you and I

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.794
get to DC,

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:40.097
let's make sure we give him
a run for his money.

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:42.069
Okay?

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:03.881
Hey.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.385
Hi.

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:09.192
I'm off to DC tomorrow.

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:13.497
- Yeah, well, have fun.
- I'm sorry I've been so busy.

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:16.368
It's just this whole spelling
thing's been real intense.

01:21:17.973 --> 01:21:19.804
But you know what?

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:24.242
I'd give it all up if it meant
you and me could hang again.

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:26.770
- That's stupid.
- Why's it stupid?

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:29.477
'Cause people want to see you
do good.

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:34.378
I want to see you do good.

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:39.415
You know what?
Georgia, you're my best friend.

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:43.192
And you always tell me I can do things
even when I think I can't.

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:46.663
But I gotta tell you something.

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:50.865
If you want to be a flight attendant,
you first gotta ride on a plane.

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:53.397
I will someday.

01:21:53.441 --> 01:21:55.306
How about tomorrow?

01:21:57.712 --> 01:21:59.339
Whoo!

01:22:00.782 --> 01:22:03.546
Girl, I got... I got to talk
to the captain.

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:06.986
Oh, forget flight attendant.
I'm gonna be a pilot.

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:12.016
- What's wrong with him?
- He has an aversion to heights.

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:15.791
It's an aversion to plummeting.
I may puke.

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:19.493
My brother's in the air force
and he says that fear

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:21.900
is all in your head. Here.

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:26.431
He gave me this for good luck.
Don't worry... I won't impale you.

01:22:26.474 --> 01:22:30.501
You know, I never really thanked you
for helping me at the state bee.

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:32.809
- No biggie.
- Actually,

01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:35.315
it was very chivalrous.

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:40.750
Wow.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:43.019
I'm not thinking about the plane
at all now.

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:45.583
Well, in that case...

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:51.394
<i>Behind all of your tears</i>

01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:54.498
<i>There's a smile</i>

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:56.727
<i>There's a smile</i>

01:22:58.239 --> 01:23:02.733
<i>Behind all of the rain</i>

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:04.938
<i>There's sunshine</i>

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.710
<i>For miles and miles</i>

01:23:07.749 --> 01:23:10.741
<i>Oh, everything</i>

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:12.377
<i>Everything</i>

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.121
<i>You mean everything</i>

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:17.825
<i>You mean everything</i>

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:19.850
<i>Everything to me</i>

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:22.987
<i>Everything to me</i>

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:25.966
<i>Everything to me.</i>

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.992
(shrieks)

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:31.038
- I told you not to shake it.
- I'm sorry.

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:33.540
Akeelah, I thought you guys
were supposed to be studying.

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:35.202
<i>- We are.
- Huh-uh,</i>

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:37.973
it sounds like a party in here.
Come on, you got a big day tomorrow.

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:40.004
<i>- Better call it a night.
- Half an hour more.</i>

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:42.346
15 minutes.

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:44.648
What do you think
Dylan's doing now?

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.551
Trying to learn ancient Greek.

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:49.989
- Maybe we should invite him over.
- That turd-juggler? Forget it.

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.254
I'll be back.

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:56.923
- Yeah...
- Is Dylan here?

01:24:00.268 --> 01:24:03.965
- He's busy.
- Well, um...

01:24:04.005 --> 01:24:07.372
me and some of the other kids
are hanging out in my room,

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:11.869
drinking soda pop and watching movies.
We thought maybe he'd like to come over.

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:14.677
I'm sorry, but tomorrow
is the spelling bee.

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:17.617
Well, you know, sometimes it's okay
to take a little rest

01:24:17.652 --> 01:24:20.052
right before the big event, you know?

01:24:20.088 --> 01:24:23.615
Well, perhaps that is your strategy,
but not ours.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.751
Wait wait!

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:29.423
This is for Dylan.

01:24:35.303 --> 01:24:37.294
Okay.

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:42.974
<i>Joshua: "Our deepest fear is not
that we are inadequate.</i>

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:47.038
<i>Our deepest fear is
that we are powerful</i>

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:49.676
<i>beyond measure.</i>

01:24:49.717 --> 01:24:53.118
<i>We ask ourselves 'Who am I</i>

<i>talented and fabulous? '</i>

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:03.964
<i>Actually, who are you not to be?"</i>

01:25:39.834 --> 01:25:43.133
It's okay. There.

01:25:57.552 --> 01:26:00.453
I'm Ted Saunders, here with
Katie Kerwin-McCrimmen,

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:04.652
broadcasting live from the main ballroom
of the Grand Hyatt, Washington.

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:07.786
<i>Now, Katie, as a former spelling bee
champ yourself, who do you think</i>

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:10.821
<i>we should be looking for to do well
in this year's competition?</i>

01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:13.663
<i>Several of the kids placed
very high in last year's bee,</i>

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.430
<i>especially Dylan Chiu.</i>

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:18.064
<i>He's come in second
two years in a row.</i>

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:21.542
Kick his butt, Akeelah!
B-U-T-T, butt.

01:26:21.576 --> 01:26:25.205
<i>... but the speller I've really got
my eye on is little Akeelah Anderson</i>

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:28.181
<i>from Los Angeles. She's become
a bit of a media sensation</i>

01:26:28.216 --> 01:26:30.844
<i>- because she's only 11 years old...
- That's my sister!</i>

01:26:30.885 --> 01:26:33.319
<i>... and it's her first try
at the spelling bee circuit.</i>

01:27:39.954 --> 01:27:42.445
Could you repeat the word please?

01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:45.391
"Ratiocinate, ratiocinate."

01:27:45.426 --> 01:27:47.758
What in the hell
kind of word is that?

01:27:47.795 --> 01:27:50.423
R-A-T...

01:27:50.465 --> 01:27:52.990
l-O-C...

<i>l- N-A-T-E,</i>

01:27:56.504 --> 01:27:58.995
- ratiocinate.
- That's correct.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.099
Yes.

01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:06.974
<i>Ted: For an 11-year-old kid,
that is just amazing.</i>

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:10.951
<i>Katie: But watch out...
one wrong letter and that's it.</i>

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:14.512

- What's the definition?
- Xylem is a complex tissue

01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:38.309

Xylem.
X-Y-L-E-M, xylem.

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.684
That's correct.

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:50.289
They thought they had me,
but I was too much for 'em.

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:54.991

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:03.526

01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:05.232

- Gastromyth.

01:29:24.225 --> 01:29:26.716
Empleomania.

Any ratio without separation
of two phases.

- May I have the language of origin?
- Latin.

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:06.630
Man, that's a white word if I ever
heard one. It's a trick... stop playing.

01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:09.534
<i>Katie: It's the suffix that would
trip up most people.</i>

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:11.401
<i>They would tend
to spell it T-l-O-U-S,</i>

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:12.929
<i>or C-l-O-U-S.</i>

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:16.375
Is it derived from the Latin word
argilla, meaning clay?

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:17.901
<i>That's correct.</i>

<i>- Can I start over?
- You may.</i>

01:30:53.614 --> 01:30:56.583
But you cannot change the letters
you've already spelled.

A-R-G-l-L-L-

Well, it's the 12th round, folks,

<i>Wow, they really crank them

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.982
Of course, Akeelah Anderson.

<i>Make sure you stay focused, right?</i>

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:20.551
This is your last
national spelling bee.

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:24.524
If you lose to that girl,
you're second place your whole life.

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:27.527
<i>No way! You hear me?</i>

01:34:27.561 --> 01:34:30.394
- No way!
- Peeking on someone?

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:33.558
Just wishing Dylan good luck.

01:34:33.601 --> 01:34:36.661
You've done a superb job.
I am so proud of you.

01:34:36.704 --> 01:34:40.902
Now listen, they're going to hit you
with every trick word they've got.

01:34:40.941 --> 01:34:43.341
You just remember
the things that we've studied.

01:34:43.377 --> 01:34:46.574
You can take these words apart
even if you've never seen them, right?

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:51.082
But if I don't beat Dylan,
I've still got next year, right?

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:53.552
Well, of course you do.
Although I don't know

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:56.055
how much time
we'll have to train together.

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:59.992
I've been asked to come back
and teach at UCLA, and I've said yes.

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:04.092
- Really?
- Well, far be it from me to deny

01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:09.034
the next WEB DuBois the benefits
of my acerbic wit and sour disposition.

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:22.516
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, Dr. Larabee.

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:24.882
I should get back.

01:35:24.919 --> 01:35:27.786
No matter what happens...

01:35:29.123 --> 01:35:33.253
I want you to know that I couldn't
have gotten this far without you.

01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:37.056
Akeelah, baby, there you are.
Come on.

01:35:37.098 --> 01:35:38.759
I gotta go.

01:35:40.267 --> 01:35:42.633
They're about to start up again.

01:35:53.948 --> 01:35:57.509
Don't look so nervous.
I hear she had a pretty good coach.

01:36:00.621 --> 01:36:04.352
You know, I just found out that the bee
only gives each kid two plane tickets.

01:36:04.391 --> 01:36:07.485
I was wondering how we
ended up with six.

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:10.088
Uh...

01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:12.122
perhaps it was some

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:15.226
unexpected largess
on the part of the bee.

01:36:17.004 --> 01:36:21.634
Or perhaps Akeelah's coach
is also pretty generous.

01:36:25.546 --> 01:36:27.343
Thanks.

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:29.611
For everything.

01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:33.415
<i>- You're welcome.
- Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:36.890
let's welcome Akeelah and Dylan
back to the stage.

01:36:37.925 --> 01:36:40.587
<i>Ted: Now remember,
if either speller misses a word,</i>

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:43.028
the other has to spell
that missed word

01:36:43.063 --> 01:36:45.793
<i>- plus another to win, right?
- Katie: That's right.</i>

01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:49.360
And we could exhaust
all 25 championship words.

01:36:49.403 --> 01:36:51.064
<i>But it's never happened.</i>

01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:53.630
<i>The championship words
are just too difficult.</i>

01:36:53.674 --> 01:36:56.939
- "Filiopietistic."
- Can I have the definition please?

01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:59.537
<i>Of, or relating to,
an often excessive</i>

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:02.140
<i>veneration
of ancestors or tradition.</i>

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:03.946
Filiopietistic:

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:06.976
F-l...

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:10.218
<i>L- I...</i>

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:30.837
Akeelah, you're up.

01:37:37.885 --> 01:37:39.546
"Xanthosis."

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:43.523
- Xanthosis?
- It starts with an X.

01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:04.540
Miss Anderson?

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.915
Xanthosis:

01:38:14.955 --> 01:38:18.220
Z-A-N...

01:38:18.259 --> 01:38:21.092
<i>T- H-O...</i>

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:23.460
<i>S- l-S...</i>

01:38:24.498 --> 01:38:27.490
<i>- xanthosis.
- (bell rings)</i>

01:38:41.582 --> 01:38:43.675
<i>Dylan, it's your turn.</i>

01:38:50.424 --> 01:38:52.255
"Xanthosis."

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.730
Xanthosis:

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:10.039
<i>X- A-N...</i>

01:39:10.077 --> 01:39:14.070
T-H-O-S...

01:39:17.217 --> 01:39:20.414
E-S, xanthosis.

01:39:21.488 --> 01:39:23.217
<i>(bell rings)</i>

01:39:24.224 --> 01:39:25.885
<i>Xanthosis is spelled</i>

01:39:25.926 --> 01:39:27.416
<i>X- A-N...</i>

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:30.191
<i>T- H-O-S-l-S.</i>

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.425
Can I get some water, please?

01:39:35.469 --> 01:39:37.801
Can we please get
both spellers some water?

01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:46.538
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:48.878
- You just threw that word.
- So did you.

01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:51.111
You're just gonna
give this all away?

01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:52.948
Your dad will be happy.

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:58.088
Who cares? He's never
won anything in his life.

01:39:58.125 --> 01:40:00.685
I won the regionals
three times in a row.

01:40:00.728 --> 01:40:03.390
And I finished second
in the nationals twice.

01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:06.866
And now you can finish first.
I could do it next year.

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:10.199
- You do your best this year.
- Dylan...

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:11.829
You do your best...

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:13.635
or I don't want it.

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:17.171
<i>Man:
Here's your water.</i>

01:40:23.784 --> 01:40:27.345
That's kind of amazing, isn't it,
that both of these incredible spellers

01:40:27.388 --> 01:40:29.083
<i>would stumble on that word?</i>

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:31.717
<i>I think we've got some
pretty nervous kids up there.</i>

01:40:31.759 --> 01:40:35.695
"Effleurage" or "effleurage."

01:40:39.833 --> 01:40:43.701
E-F-F-L-E-U...

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:45.796
R-A-G-E,

01:40:45.839 --> 01:40:48.535
- effleurage.
- That's correct.

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:54.577
<i>Ted: This is just like watching
two star tennis players</i>

01:40:54.615 --> 01:40:58.210
<i>at the net returning volleys.
I mean, these kids are incredible.</i>

01:40:58.252 --> 01:41:02.188
Lagniappe: L-A-G-N-l-A-P-P-E,
lagniappe.

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:04.190
- Sumpsimus.
- Could you use it in a sentence please?

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:05.691
- Is that a verb?
- Ophelimity.

01:41:05.726 --> 01:41:07.387
- Tralatitious.
- That is correct.

01:41:07.428 --> 01:41:09.123
- Sophrosyne.
- Parrhesia.

01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:10.892
- Is that Greek?
- Was that Latin?

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:12.023
- What's the language...
...of origin please?

01:41:12.066 --> 01:41:13.465
- Lyophilize.
- Zarzuela.

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.024
- Vibrissae.
- Craquelure.

01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:16.400
That's correct.

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:19.497
<i>Ted: These kids a chewing through
these super-tough words</i>

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:21.599
<i>like they were breakfast cereal.</i>

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:24.076
<i>Katie: You know, they could
actually go the distance,</i>

01:41:24.111 --> 01:41:26.909
<i>and most people
consider that unthinkable.</i>

01:41:26.947 --> 01:41:30.246
We're now 13 words
into the championship level.

01:41:30.284 --> 01:41:34.220
If you make it through the remaining
12 words, you'll be co-champions.

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:37.155
<i>That's never happened before.</i>

01:41:37.191 --> 01:41:38.783
- Vinegarroon.
- Ecdysis.

01:41:38.826 --> 01:41:40.316
- Concitato.
- Puerpera.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.191
That's correct.

01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:44.754
<i>Ted: Dylan and Akeelah are
trying to stage a miracle here.</i>

01:41:44.798 --> 01:41:47.961
<i>Katie: And to make it to the finish line
they need each other to succeed.</i>

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:51.232
...E- R-A-Z...

01:41:57.478 --> 01:41:59.844
A-D-l-A-N,

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:02.075
- Scheherazadian.
- That's correct.

01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:08.987
<i>Akeelah:
... L-O-G-I...</i>

01:42:10.591 --> 01:42:14.960
C-A-L, palynological.

01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:17.225
That's correct.

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:24.664
<i>Judge:
Ladies and gentlemen, we are down</i>

01:42:24.705 --> 01:42:26.866
<i>to the final
two championship words.</i>

01:42:26.907 --> 01:42:29.205
One or both of our spellers

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:32.371
<i>will walk away
with the first place trophy.</i>

01:42:32.412 --> 01:42:33.936
Dylan, you're up.

01:42:41.288 --> 01:42:44.451
- "Logorrhea."
- May I have the definition please?

01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:47.324
<i>Logorrhea is excessive</i>

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:50.296
<i>and often incoherent
talkativeness.</i>

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:58.104
Logorrhea:

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:03.233
L...

01:43:03.277 --> 01:43:05.074
O...

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:07.979
G-O...

01:43:09.683 --> 01:43:11.275
R...

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:14.151
R-H...

01:43:14.188 --> 01:43:17.954
E-A, logorrhea?

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:20.482
<i>Judge:
Congratulations, Dylan,</i>

01:43:20.527 --> 01:43:23.394
<i>you've won the Scripps
National Spelling Bee.</i>

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:26.922
Yes! Yes!

01:43:30.204 --> 01:43:32.172
Go get 'em.

01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:41.779
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be seated for Akeelah's turn.

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:49.955
"Pulchritude."

01:43:50.991 --> 01:43:53.050
Pulchritude.

01:43:58.432 --> 01:44:02.027
It's derived from
the Latin word "pulcher,"

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:04.902
<i>meaning beautiful,</i>

01:44:04.938 --> 01:44:07.031
- isn't it?
- That's correct.

01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:09.770

- E.
- Pulchritude.

01:44:21.488 --> 01:44:23.479
Congratulations, Akeelah.

01:44:28.195 --> 01:44:30.629
That's what I'm talking about!

01:44:32.966 --> 01:44:36.129
<i>Akeelah: You know that feeling
where everything feels right?</i>

01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:39.570
<i>Where you don't have to worry
about tomorrow</i>

01:44:39.606 --> 01:44:41.403
<i>or yesterday,</i>

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:44.933
<i>but you feel safe and know
you're doing the best you can?</i>

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:47.674
<i>There's a word for that feeling.</i>

01:44:47.714 --> 01:44:50.205
<i>It's called love.</i>

01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:53.617
<i>L- O-V-E.</i>

01:44:53.654 --> 01:44:56.248
<i>And it's what I feel for all my family,</i>

01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:59.487
<i>and all my coaches
in my neighborhood,</i>

01:44:59.526 --> 01:45:01.494
<i>where I come from,</i>

01:45:01.528 --> 01:45:05.464
<i>where I learned how to spell.</i>

01:45:24.785 --> 01:45:26.650
We did it.

01:45:44.838 --> 01:45:49.070
<i>Write it down
a thousand times</i>

01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:54.376
<i>Four-letter word

01:45:54.414 --> 01:45:58.680
<i>How I feel about it
I can't decide</i>

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:04.351
<i>No, I don't know,
so I'll improvise</i>

01:46:04.391 --> 01:46:08.657
<i>Is it living in our heart?</i>

01:46:08.695 --> 01:46:11.163
<i>Or in our mind?</i>

01:46:11.198 --> 01:46:13.223
<i>I don't know</i>

01:46:13.266 --> 01:46:17.703
<i>So, World, ready or not</i>

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:20.400
<i>Here I go</i>

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:23.466
<i>Searching for the answer</i>

01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:27.412
<i>And I'm not gonna stop</i>

01:46:27.447 --> 01:46:33.386
<i>Till I find
where it lingers inside me</i>

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:38.084
<i>How does it come to be?</i>

01:46:38.125 --> 01:46:42.994
<i>What should it mean to me?</i>

01:46:43.029 --> 01:46:47.056
<i>Teach me the definition</i>

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:51.969
<i>Of true love</i>

01:46:52.973 --> 01:46:54.964
<i>(vocalizing)</i>

01:46:58.545 --> 01:47:02.572
<i>I was so afraid
I'd never succeed</i>

01:47:02.616 --> 01:47:08.555
<i>But you made me feel
I could do anything</i>

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:12.718
<i>Memorize the things
we would say and do</i>

01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:18.527
<i>Must be the love and the strength
that I found in you</i>

01:47:18.565 --> 01:47:22.729
<i>Is it living in our heart?</i>

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:25.101
<i>Or in our mind?</i>

01:47:25.138 --> 01:47:29.802
<i>I don't know</i>

01:47:29.843 --> 01:47:33.904
<i>So, World, ready or not</i>

01:47:33.947 --> 01:47:39.510
<i>Ooh, here I go,
searching for the answer</i>

01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:43.751
<i>And I'm not gonna stop</i>

01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:50.059
<i>Till I find
where it lives inside me</i>

01:47:50.096 --> 01:47:54.556
<i>How does it come to be?</i>

01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:59.470
<i>What should it mean to me?</i>

01:47:59.506 --> 01:48:03.567
<i>Teach me the definition</i>

01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:08.240
<i>Of true love</i>

01:48:08.281 --> 01:48:11.876
<i>Love only feels good</i>

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:15.649
<i>True love always believes</i>

01:48:15.689 --> 01:48:19.056
<i>And it gives way
the boundaries</i>

<i>To weather
the twists and turns</i>

01:50:13.239 --> 01:50:16.333

<i>'Cause I can fly alone</i>

01:50:47.874 --> 01:50:50.502
