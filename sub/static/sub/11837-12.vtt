00:02.178 --> 00:03.880
BERLUTI: Previously
on The Practice...

00:03.914 --> 00:05.282
Hi.

00:05.316 --> 00:06.350
Hi.

00:06.383 --> 00:08.652
It's just too phallic.

00:08.685 --> 00:09.486
Do you mind?

00:09.520 --> 00:10.521
You know, I've heard of this

00:10.554 --> 00:11.588
faux flirtatiousness

00:11.622 --> 00:13.123
being used to cover
the real thing.

00:13.156 --> 00:14.891
Are you attracted to me?

00:14.925 --> 00:16.627
You know what I love
about your talk, Alan?

00:16.660 --> 00:18.329
SHORE: Hmm.
Is it makes me feel safe.

00:18.362 --> 00:19.696
Does it, now?
WILSON: Hmm.

00:19.730 --> 00:21.632
Because men who talk

00:21.665 --> 00:24.034
never do anything.

00:24.067 --> 00:26.770
I never make the first move.

00:26.803 --> 00:29.906
I always make the first move.

00:31.908 --> 00:33.910
But I'm not going to here.

00:37.281 --> 00:40.217
(music playing)

01:05.682 --> 01:07.618
(indistinct chatter)

01:36.347 --> 01:39.283
(music playing)

01:46.923 --> 01:48.659
Hey, last call
was five minutes ago.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.927
Ah, really?

01:50.961 --> 01:52.929
It's late, buddy.

01:52.963 --> 01:54.164
Little boys' room?

01:55.299 --> 01:57.000
Yeah, in the back
on your left.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.034
Thanks.

02:23.734 --> 02:25.135
Charlie Haden?

02:25.168 --> 02:26.637
Yeah.

02:28.505 --> 02:30.941
Who the hell are you?

02:39.383 --> 02:40.784
(crashing)

02:42.919 --> 02:45.756
(grunting)

02:45.789 --> 02:48.158
(panting)

02:56.132 --> 02:57.901
Call the cops.

02:59.470 --> 03:02.313
(music playing)

03:40.584 --> 03:41.485
What's his name?

03:41.518 --> 03:42.653
Walter Josephson.

03:42.686 --> 03:43.954
Assault
with a deadly weapon.

03:43.987 --> 03:45.155
And attempted murder.

03:45.188 --> 03:46.457
Assuming the victim
doesn't die.

03:46.490 --> 03:48.191
Exactly.

03:48.225 --> 03:49.626
HARTIG: Jimmy Berluti?

03:49.660 --> 03:50.394
BERLUTI: Yeah.

03:50.427 --> 03:51.962
Alex Hartig. Hi.

03:51.995 --> 03:53.930
Jamie Stringer.

03:53.964 --> 03:56.367
What can you tell me
about your client?

03:56.400 --> 03:58.502
I can tell you
I've never even met him.

03:58.535 --> 03:59.370
Other than that,

03:59.403 --> 04:01.278
why should I tell you anything?

04:01.312 --> 04:02.879
Well, let's start
with what I know.

04:02.913 --> 04:04.515
Retired dockworker,

04:04.548 --> 04:05.382
no criminal record,

04:05.416 --> 04:06.617
not a blemish.

04:06.650 --> 04:07.818
As for the guy he beat up,

04:07.851 --> 04:09.820
Charlie Haden.

04:12.188 --> 04:14.124
Who's Charlie Haden?

04:14.157 --> 04:16.192
He's what you call
a bad guy.

04:16.226 --> 04:17.827
Loan-sharking, extortion,

04:17.861 --> 04:19.062
armed robbery,

04:19.095 --> 04:20.897
he used to run
with the Tommy Moynihan gang.

04:21.765 --> 04:24.134
Since you're volunteering
information,

04:24.167 --> 04:26.202
why would my retired choirboy

04:26.237 --> 04:28.439
assault somebody
from the Irish mob?

04:28.472 --> 04:29.606
That's what I was hoping

04:29.640 --> 04:30.874
you could tell me.

04:38.582 --> 04:39.716
WILSON: May I help you?

04:39.749 --> 04:41.585
Yes, I'm looking for Alan--

04:41.618 --> 04:42.853
SHORE: Dwight.

04:42.886 --> 04:43.987
HABER: Alan.

04:46.857 --> 04:48.525
This is where you work?

04:48.559 --> 04:50.594
It is. I know it's small
and depressing,

04:50.627 --> 04:52.663
but at least
it's dark and damp.

04:52.696 --> 04:54.531
Don't tell anyone.

04:54.565 --> 04:56.400
Is there someplace
we could speak in private?

04:56.433 --> 04:57.334
Of course.

04:57.368 --> 04:58.802
Borrow your office, Ellenor?

04:58.835 --> 04:59.903
Normally,
it'd be in my office,

04:59.936 --> 05:01.345
but there aren't enough
to go around,

05:01.378 --> 05:02.145
so we're taking turns.

05:07.751 --> 05:08.885
What's up?

05:10.387 --> 05:12.088
My wife and I
have recently split.

05:12.122 --> 05:13.156
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:13.189 --> 05:14.625
This is your second wife, Eve?

05:14.658 --> 05:15.959
Yes.

05:15.992 --> 05:16.693
The one who married you

05:16.727 --> 05:18.028
for your money.

05:18.061 --> 05:20.331
Clearly, that has turned out
to be the case.

05:20.364 --> 05:21.398
Would that I had friends

05:21.432 --> 05:23.600
who were candid
before we married.

05:27.238 --> 05:28.472
Please...

05:28.505 --> 05:29.706
how can I help?

05:31.675 --> 05:32.876
In the same wave of stupidity

05:32.909 --> 05:34.010
that caused me to marry her,

05:34.044 --> 05:35.612
I neglected
to get a prenup.

05:35.646 --> 05:37.281
Oh, Dwight.

05:39.350 --> 05:41.418
I certainly realize
that equitable distribution

05:41.452 --> 05:43.086
is the law, Alan.

05:43.119 --> 05:45.389
But this woman
cheated on me,

05:45.422 --> 05:47.924
she probably never loved me,

05:47.958 --> 05:51.061
and under the heading
of morality

05:51.094 --> 05:53.129
and basic fairness--

05:53.163 --> 05:54.865
You want to screw her over.

05:54.898 --> 05:57.067
I'm not, by nature,
a vindictive man

05:57.100 --> 05:58.835
you know this.

05:58.869 --> 06:00.704
But, Alan,

06:00.737 --> 06:03.780
I earned all of it.

06:03.814 --> 06:06.717
I put her through law school.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.752
And my conscience
just mandates--

06:08.785 --> 06:10.754
You screw her over.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.590
Which is why I come to you.

06:13.624 --> 06:14.725
I need you to turn

06:14.758 --> 06:16.293
inward to your core here.

06:16.327 --> 06:18.295
SHORE: Hmm. You don't mean that.

06:18.329 --> 06:21.365
Yes, I do.

06:21.398 --> 06:23.900
As petty as it sounds...

06:23.934 --> 06:25.836
I want to get her.

06:25.869 --> 06:27.304
No holds barred?

06:27.338 --> 06:30.507
None.
I can be despicable.

06:30.541 --> 06:32.843
Bombs away.

06:32.876 --> 06:34.311
The man she's sleeping with
is Warren Holt.

06:34.345 --> 06:35.612
He's her boss.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.914
They both work in
the attorney general's office.

06:37.948 --> 06:39.850
They meet twice a week
at the Dobson hotel,

06:39.883 --> 06:40.684
same room, every--

06:40.717 --> 06:41.618
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

06:41.652 --> 06:42.919
What did you just say?

06:42.953 --> 06:43.920
He's her boss.

06:43.954 --> 06:45.989
No, no, no--after that.

06:46.022 --> 06:47.258
They meet twice a week

06:47.291 --> 06:48.992
in the same hotel.
Just before that.

06:49.025 --> 06:51.562
They both work
in the A. G.'s office.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.432
(sighs)

06:55.466 --> 06:56.667
You're having
second thoughts now?

06:56.700 --> 06:58.369
Oh, no.

06:58.402 --> 07:00.237
(laughing) oh, no.

07:01.945 --> 07:03.247
It was just a fight--

07:03.280 --> 07:04.615
nothing more.

07:04.648 --> 07:06.483
Just a fight?

07:06.517 --> 07:08.919
I went into the bar
to go to the men's room,

07:08.952 --> 07:10.787
and I got in a fight with him.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.589
Charlie Haden.

07:12.623 --> 07:14.325
Is that his name?

07:14.358 --> 07:15.992
Well, what was
the fight about?

07:16.026 --> 07:17.494
To be honest with you,

07:17.528 --> 07:18.795
I don't know.

07:21.164 --> 07:22.233
I guess he got upset

07:22.266 --> 07:23.667
'cause I walked
into his office

07:23.700 --> 07:24.801
or something.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.503
Mr. Josephson--

07:26.537 --> 07:27.638
Call me "Walter".

07:28.605 --> 07:31.442
Walter, do you know
Mr. Haden?

07:31.475 --> 07:32.843
No.

07:32.876 --> 07:34.645
You walked into his office,

07:34.678 --> 07:36.647
and, what,
he just attacked you?

07:36.680 --> 07:37.914
Yeah.

07:40.951 --> 07:42.853
Walter, anything you say to us

07:42.886 --> 07:44.588
stays right here.

07:44.621 --> 07:46.189
Your best opportunity

07:46.223 --> 07:47.258
for a good defense--

07:47.291 --> 07:49.192
This man is on life support.

07:49.226 --> 07:51.662
He figures to die...

07:51.695 --> 07:53.096
you're in trouble, Walter.

07:53.129 --> 07:55.766
Look, I did it.

07:55.799 --> 07:57.434
I didn't mean to, but...

07:58.935 --> 08:00.704
I'm willing to serve time.

08:01.645 --> 08:03.214
You're willing to do time?

08:04.581 --> 08:05.782
For possible murder,

08:05.816 --> 08:07.318
that's life.

08:08.285 --> 08:09.853
I'm an old man.

08:10.987 --> 08:11.988
I got no family,

08:12.022 --> 08:14.591
except my sister in Plymouth.

08:17.594 --> 08:19.830
I don't want to go through
a long trial.

08:20.664 --> 08:23.133
I'll cut a deal if they'll--

08:23.166 --> 08:25.502
they'll put me
in someplace tolerable.

08:26.503 --> 08:27.804
I don't want to die

08:27.838 --> 08:29.940
in some maximum hole
like Cedar's.

08:30.907 --> 08:33.009
You get them
to put me someplace

08:33.043 --> 08:34.477
near my sister,

08:34.510 --> 08:36.280
where she can visit...

08:36.313 --> 08:38.114
I'll plead guilty.

08:38.148 --> 08:39.883
You got a defense.

08:39.916 --> 08:41.251
If the guy attacked you--

08:41.284 --> 08:44.355
If I killed a man,
Mr. Berluti,

08:44.388 --> 08:45.222
they're not gonna let me off

08:45.256 --> 08:47.458
without doing time.

08:48.191 --> 08:49.260
No.

08:50.227 --> 08:51.328
You get them to send me

08:51.362 --> 08:53.297
to a medium-security
near my sister.

08:53.330 --> 08:54.498
You get me that,

08:55.466 --> 08:58.535
and, uh, I'll plead guilty,

08:58.569 --> 08:59.803
it's simple as that.

09:04.114 --> 09:07.050
(indistinct chatter)

09:11.555 --> 09:13.924
It's just 1423
has a very specific

09:13.957 --> 09:15.259
sentimental value
for us.

09:15.292 --> 09:16.493
We honeymooned
in that room.

09:16.527 --> 09:17.661
I understand,

09:17.694 --> 09:19.696
but that room
is occupied.

09:19.730 --> 09:21.265
We have guests
checking into it at--

09:21.298 --> 09:22.966
Can't you put them
in another room?

09:22.999 --> 09:24.735
I'm afraid they requested
it, as well.

09:24.768 --> 09:26.670
It overlooks the park.

09:26.703 --> 09:28.004
Please.

09:28.038 --> 09:29.373
I wish I could help.

09:29.406 --> 09:30.407
I really do.

09:33.477 --> 09:34.278
SHORE: It's okay, honey.

09:34.311 --> 09:36.680
We can get another room.

09:36.713 --> 09:39.082
(voice breaking)
It's not the same.

09:39.115 --> 09:40.251
I mean, how could
the travel agent make such

09:40.284 --> 09:41.418
a monumental mistake?

09:41.452 --> 09:43.220
We're not even booked
to the hotel at all?

09:45.055 --> 09:47.157
We came all the way
from Detroit.

09:47.190 --> 09:48.759
I'm sorry.

09:48.792 --> 09:50.461
I'll tell you what,
is it Connie?

09:50.494 --> 09:51.528
CONNIE: Yes.

09:54.365 --> 09:55.532
How about--

09:55.566 --> 09:58.602
could we have the room
for an hour...

09:58.635 --> 10:00.371
if you know what I mean?

10:00.404 --> 10:02.679
It's our anniversary, please.

10:04.748 --> 10:05.916
Well...

10:07.150 --> 10:09.320
can you promise
to be out by 2:00?

10:09.353 --> 10:10.421
I give you my word.

10:10.454 --> 10:12.723
I won't even take
my little blue pill.

10:17.261 --> 10:19.195
(chuckling)

10:20.731 --> 10:23.467
SHORE: I am entering the room
as we speak.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.836
So, how long will it
take you to set up?

10:25.869 --> 10:27.738
Well, let's get going.

10:27.771 --> 10:29.139
All right.

10:29.172 --> 10:30.341
The private investigator
and his camera crew

10:30.374 --> 10:31.375
are on their way.

10:31.408 --> 10:32.476
They'll be here
in 20 minutes.

10:32.509 --> 10:33.544
And we know for a fact
that they always use

10:33.577 --> 10:34.478
this room?

10:34.511 --> 10:35.646
So says Dwight,

10:35.679 --> 10:37.581
and you heard Connie.

10:37.614 --> 10:38.949
This is illegal,
you know.

10:38.982 --> 10:40.817
We could even go to jail.
Oh, come on.

10:40.851 --> 10:43.520
People have no expectation
of privacy here.

10:43.554 --> 10:44.388
This is America,

10:44.421 --> 10:46.122
home of the P. A. T. R. I. O. T. Act.

10:48.124 --> 10:50.126
So, Tara...

10:51.228 --> 10:52.429
here we are in a hotel room

10:52.463 --> 10:54.798
with 20 minutes to kill.

10:54.831 --> 10:56.333
Gee, Alan,

10:57.434 --> 11:00.911
that could almost
be construed as a move,

11:00.944 --> 11:02.546
but not quite.

11:06.450 --> 11:08.819
I'm still waiting.

11:09.286 --> 11:10.921
So am I.

11:16.727 --> 11:17.828
No deal?

11:17.861 --> 11:20.297
My guy's willing to plead.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.766
Yes, to medium security.

11:22.799 --> 11:23.534
Things have changed a little

11:23.567 --> 11:25.035
since this morning, Jimmy.

11:25.068 --> 11:26.036
Like what?

11:26.069 --> 11:27.438
Like we've now got motive

11:27.471 --> 11:29.906
and premeditation.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.141
Seven years ago,

11:31.174 --> 11:33.076
your client's only daughter
was murdered.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.010
She wasn't the target.

11:34.044 --> 11:34.878
She was in the wrong place

11:34.911 --> 11:36.413
at the wrong time.

11:36.447 --> 11:37.348
Her house was next to the one

11:37.381 --> 11:38.715
that was torched.

11:38.749 --> 11:41.385
Guess who we picked up
for the crime.

11:41.418 --> 11:42.753
Charlie Haden.

11:43.954 --> 11:44.888
We couldn't make him,

11:44.921 --> 11:45.889
and, eventually, he walked,

11:45.922 --> 11:48.259
but we remain convinced
that he did it,

11:48.292 --> 11:50.461
which your client knows.

11:51.462 --> 11:53.230
So when he walked
into that bar--

11:53.264 --> 11:54.698
He was planning to kill the man

11:54.731 --> 11:56.267
who murdered his daughter,

11:57.334 --> 12:00.103
that's premeditated...

12:00.136 --> 12:01.312
and it's murder one.

12:02.579 --> 12:04.881
STRINGER: Premeditated
with a tequila bottle?

12:04.915 --> 12:06.317
The fire that killed
his daughter

12:06.350 --> 12:08.219
was started
with a Molotov cocktail

12:08.252 --> 12:10.821
made from a tequila bottle...

12:12.623 --> 12:14.558
a little poetic justice.

12:15.091 --> 12:18.028
(music playing)

12:23.867 --> 12:26.136
SHORE: Hmm.

12:26.169 --> 12:28.104
They must be really in love,

12:28.138 --> 12:29.906
don't you think?

12:29.940 --> 12:31.275
WILSON: So, now what?

12:31.308 --> 12:34.478
Well, we show these
to Dwight,

12:34.511 --> 12:36.179
then we schedule a meeting

12:36.213 --> 12:38.849
with Eve and her lawyer,

12:38.882 --> 12:39.883
and we extort them

12:39.916 --> 12:41.852
with reckless abandon.

12:41.885 --> 12:43.887
WILSON: This seems...

12:43.920 --> 12:45.589
slightly despicable.

12:45.622 --> 12:47.090
He hired me
to be despicable,

12:47.123 --> 12:48.525
I promise.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.760
Oh.
Mmm.

12:49.793 --> 12:51.027
Well, that makes it
all right, then.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.128
Silly me.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.298
You know,

12:54.331 --> 12:56.467
when I'd go
to the movies as a boy,

12:56.500 --> 12:58.101
I'd always pretend
to be the leading man

12:58.134 --> 12:59.536
on the screen.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.078
I still like to do that
sometimes.

13:03.814 --> 13:06.182
Hmm. How about you, Tara?

13:06.217 --> 13:07.518
You ever like to pretend

13:07.551 --> 13:10.887
to be the leading lady
on the screen?

13:13.257 --> 13:14.658
You know,
you'd be quite something

13:14.691 --> 13:16.260
if talk ever amounted to action.

13:16.293 --> 13:18.161
SHORE: You surprise me, Tara.

13:18.194 --> 13:19.730
Even a first-year
law student knows

13:19.763 --> 13:22.198
that talk can be deemed
assertive conduct

13:22.233 --> 13:23.567
and actionable.

13:25.035 --> 13:26.270
Do you still fantasize

13:26.303 --> 13:27.671
about me at night, Alan?

13:29.273 --> 13:32.343
Giving you far too much
credit, perhaps.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.177
You think?

13:34.210 --> 13:36.813
I'm willing to be proved wrong.

13:39.816 --> 13:40.784
This is unprofessional.

13:40.817 --> 13:41.752
Ellenor.

13:41.785 --> 13:44.087
I didn't hear
you come in.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.789
What a shock.

13:48.825 --> 13:50.126
This is why
you should have been

13:50.160 --> 13:51.862
open with us.

13:51.895 --> 13:53.864
Now they got a motive.

13:53.897 --> 13:55.599
STRINGER: And premeditation.

13:55.632 --> 13:57.468
I don't care.

13:59.035 --> 14:00.304
You can get me
near my sister,

14:00.337 --> 14:01.278
I'll still...

14:03.647 --> 14:06.283
I just want to give up.

14:06.317 --> 14:07.451
I'm tired.

14:10.354 --> 14:12.188
There is some good news.

14:12.223 --> 14:14.791
Charlie Haden pulled through.

14:14.825 --> 14:16.360
He did?

14:16.393 --> 14:18.362
BERLUTI: The doctors think
he's gonna recover now,

14:18.395 --> 14:21.031
so no murder charge, at least.

14:21.064 --> 14:22.699
That's great.

14:27.404 --> 14:29.273
Oh. So, what do you think
I should do?

14:31.041 --> 14:33.109
I certainly don't want to rush

14:33.143 --> 14:35.011
into any deal.

14:35.045 --> 14:37.281
We got the P. C.
Hearing today.

14:37.314 --> 14:38.682
We'll have a better idea

14:38.715 --> 14:41.218
what their case is after.

14:41.252 --> 14:43.053
Are you telling me
I can beat this?

14:44.688 --> 14:47.691
Let's just see what they put up.

14:47.724 --> 14:50.227
Okay, yeah.

14:50.261 --> 14:51.395
You beat this,

14:51.428 --> 14:53.964
get me my life back...

14:53.997 --> 14:55.198
please.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.303
Let's do it.

14:59.336 --> 15:01.845
Do I need to see them?

15:01.878 --> 15:03.179
Not if you don't care
to be present

15:03.214 --> 15:04.281
at the meeting.

15:05.949 --> 15:07.218
But if you do,

15:08.619 --> 15:11.422
it's important
you remain stoic.

15:11.455 --> 15:13.990
As aggressive
as I intend to be, Dwight,

15:14.024 --> 15:15.859
I'm acting as your agent.

15:15.892 --> 15:17.694
Any softness
perceived in you,

15:17.728 --> 15:18.695
therefore--
Let me see them.

15:18.729 --> 15:19.696
Hold on.

15:21.532 --> 15:22.799
It isn't necessary for you

15:22.833 --> 15:23.534
to be in the meeting.

15:23.567 --> 15:24.901
Yes, it is.

15:27.738 --> 15:28.805
Let me see the pictures.

15:28.839 --> 15:30.641
Dwight...

15:30.674 --> 15:31.675
look at me.

15:33.644 --> 15:35.279
They're graphic,

15:35.312 --> 15:36.947
and they will be
hurtful to view.

15:38.249 --> 15:40.116
I want to see
the pictures, Alan.

15:53.063 --> 15:54.130
SHORE: Legally,
these photographs

15:54.164 --> 15:56.567
have little or no relevance.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.034
You do understand

15:58.068 --> 16:00.237
this will be a tacit attempt
at extortion.

16:02.946 --> 16:04.215
Our hope here is that

16:04.248 --> 16:06.483
a professional woman

16:06.517 --> 16:08.719
isn't going to want
these pictures

16:08.752 --> 16:10.754
to get much circulation.

16:14.591 --> 16:15.626
Okay, look up now.

16:22.266 --> 16:24.568
I need you to take a breath

16:24.601 --> 16:26.270
and consider
that you're currently

16:26.303 --> 16:29.573
in the wake of a very
emotional trauma.

16:29.606 --> 16:31.007
In time,

16:31.041 --> 16:32.609
much of your pain will subside.

16:32.643 --> 16:33.944
There's a chance you and Eve

16:33.977 --> 16:35.679
could be friends down the road.

16:35.712 --> 16:36.680
Now, you may not want that.

16:36.713 --> 16:40.116
I don't.
But if you do, Dwight,

16:40.150 --> 16:41.452
if you can make room

16:41.485 --> 16:43.019
for the slightest possibility

16:43.053 --> 16:45.422
that you might,

16:45.456 --> 16:46.790
then you need to think twice

16:46.823 --> 16:48.925
about employing this tactic.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.763
This woman caused me

16:52.796 --> 16:54.998
to fall in love with her,

16:55.031 --> 16:56.867
when she had no
real love for me.

17:00.170 --> 17:01.278
She hurt me.

17:02.446 --> 17:04.248
In fact, she destroyed me,

17:04.281 --> 17:06.116
and she did so with malice.

17:07.851 --> 17:09.819
I hired you to get her.

17:12.455 --> 17:13.723
I want you to play the card.

17:16.627 --> 17:18.762
Dwight, given how much
you still love her,

17:18.795 --> 17:20.431
maybe--
Play the card.

17:25.602 --> 17:28.171
PRICE: Mr. Josephson
asked to use the bathroom,

17:28.204 --> 17:30.040
then he went in the back.

17:30.073 --> 17:32.743
There's an office there
Mr. Haden uses.

17:32.776 --> 17:35.312
He's friends
with the owner.

17:35.346 --> 17:36.347
I heard some noises,

17:36.380 --> 17:39.383
like a crash
and someone fighting,

17:39.416 --> 17:41.485
so I went back there.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.254
What did you see?

17:43.287 --> 17:44.355
Well, Mr. Haden was all bloody,

17:44.388 --> 17:45.656
like he'd been beat up,

17:45.689 --> 17:48.158
and Mr. Josephson
was sitting down.

17:48.191 --> 17:49.526
He told me to call
the cops.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.628
Was there anyone else
in the bar

17:51.662 --> 17:53.029
besides Mr. Josephson

17:53.063 --> 17:55.198
who could have attacked
Mr. Haden?

17:55.232 --> 17:56.900
Probably, yeah.

17:59.403 --> 18:01.378
HARTIG: You told
the police that--

18:01.412 --> 18:02.679
I'm quoting--

18:02.713 --> 18:04.080
"Josephson was the only

18:04.114 --> 18:05.516
other person in the bar."

18:05.549 --> 18:07.384
Objection--leading.

18:07.418 --> 18:08.919
I'll allow it.

18:08.952 --> 18:10.687
PRICE: There's a fire door
in the back.

18:10.721 --> 18:12.256
I think someone might
have propped it open,

18:12.289 --> 18:13.657
gone in and out.

18:13.690 --> 18:15.959
You didn't tell this
to the police before.

18:15.992 --> 18:17.594
It just came to me.

18:17.628 --> 18:19.496
HARTIG: You did tell the police

18:19.530 --> 18:20.664
that Walter Josephson

18:20.697 --> 18:21.932
went into the back room

18:21.965 --> 18:23.834
and just seconds later,

18:23.867 --> 18:25.135
you heard the fight.

18:25.168 --> 18:27.070
Yes, but it's possible

18:27.103 --> 18:29.406
Josephson saw someone else
beating on Charlie

18:29.440 --> 18:30.541
and tried to help out.

18:30.574 --> 18:31.875
Someone else who?

18:31.908 --> 18:33.644
I got no idea.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.646
I'm just not sure
that old man did it.

18:35.679 --> 18:36.580
Have you been asked

18:36.613 --> 18:37.881
to change your testimony?

18:37.914 --> 18:41.218
No, I'm just trying to do
the right thing.

18:41.252 --> 18:42.419
Approach.

18:49.493 --> 18:50.861
What's going on?

18:50.894 --> 18:53.163
Haden must have ordered
this guy to flip.

18:53.196 --> 18:55.499
Why would the victim
torpedo the case

18:55.532 --> 18:56.700
against the man who beat him?

18:56.733 --> 18:58.635
Haden's the main suspect
in the murder

18:58.669 --> 18:59.903
of Walter Josephson's daughter

18:59.936 --> 19:00.944
seven years ago.

19:00.977 --> 19:02.078
It's possible he doesn't want it

19:02.112 --> 19:03.347
dredged up at trial,

19:03.380 --> 19:06.917
or he could be wanting
to exact his own justice.

19:06.950 --> 19:09.253
Can Haden identify
his assailant?

19:09.286 --> 19:11.021
He says he doesn't remember.

19:11.054 --> 19:12.389
Your honor--
HARTIG: We still have

19:12.423 --> 19:13.490
physical evidence.

19:13.524 --> 19:14.758
BERLUTI:
What physical evidence?

19:14.791 --> 19:16.360
No prints on the bottle
of tequila.

19:16.393 --> 19:17.761
HARTIG: Josephson
was wearing gloves.

19:17.794 --> 19:20.631
Come on. He was covered
in Haden's blood.

19:20.664 --> 19:21.665
A jury could say he got it

19:21.698 --> 19:23.667
trying to save Haden's life.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.068
You got nothing.

19:25.101 --> 19:28.204
Ms. Hartig, you get this
sorted out, great.

19:28.239 --> 19:30.073
Bring the case again.

19:30.106 --> 19:31.408
But I can't let you go forward

19:31.442 --> 19:34.210
with no evidence
and no witnesses.

19:34.245 --> 19:36.112
Everybody step back.

19:38.849 --> 19:40.183
WEEKS: Due to the current

19:40.217 --> 19:41.752
insufficiency of evidence,

19:41.785 --> 19:42.886
the case is dismissed

19:42.919 --> 19:44.187
without prejudice.

19:44.221 --> 19:45.456
(gavel pounds)

19:51.762 --> 19:52.963
It's dismissed?

19:52.996 --> 19:54.064
For now.

19:54.097 --> 19:54.998
They get more evidence,

19:55.031 --> 19:56.199
they can refile.

19:57.601 --> 19:58.769
Oh, thank you.

20:00.103 --> 20:01.612
Thank you.

20:01.645 --> 20:03.814
Walter, it's possible

20:03.847 --> 20:05.749
Haden wants you back
on the street

20:05.782 --> 20:08.084
so he can take you out.

20:08.118 --> 20:10.153
I can ask for protective custody

20:10.186 --> 20:11.455
not that I'll get it, but--

20:11.488 --> 20:13.690
I can handle myself,
Mr. Berluti.

20:13.724 --> 20:15.726
These people are bad guys.

20:15.759 --> 20:18.962
I did a tour of duty
in Korea.

20:18.995 --> 20:21.131
I can handle Charlie Haden.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.336
Thank you.

20:26.036 --> 20:28.272
Thank you both very much.

20:35.946 --> 20:37.314
Is it just me,

20:37.348 --> 20:39.416
or is our client
a dead man?

20:52.263 --> 20:54.064
WOMAN (over PA):
Dr. Davis to the OR.

20:54.097 --> 20:55.866
Dr. Davis to the OR.

20:57.701 --> 21:00.704
WOMAN (over PA): Dr. Moresco
to nurse station on 2 west.

21:00.737 --> 21:03.814
Dr. Moresco
to nurse station on 2 west.

21:16.460 --> 21:17.528
Hey.

21:17.561 --> 21:18.662
Will it be orange juice

21:18.695 --> 21:21.332
or gasoline with your eggs?

21:21.365 --> 21:23.834
Hey!

21:23.867 --> 21:25.402
HADEN: Help!

21:25.436 --> 21:28.439
Aah! Aaaaaaah!

21:28.472 --> 21:30.073
Aaaaaah!

21:30.106 --> 21:31.608
WOMAN: We got a fire
extinguisher ready.

21:31.642 --> 21:33.644
Better check his temperature.

21:33.677 --> 21:35.446
He's burning up.

21:38.549 --> 21:40.417
What?

21:40.451 --> 21:41.852
Okay, we're on our way down.

21:43.053 --> 21:45.356
(receiver clicks)

21:45.389 --> 21:48.759
Walter Josephson just set
Charlie Haden on fire.

21:48.792 --> 21:50.193
This time, he's dead.

21:50.227 --> 21:51.194
Oh, my god.

21:52.363 --> 21:53.730
He's in custody.
Let's go.

22:05.582 --> 22:07.083
Hello.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.051
Eve.

22:09.152 --> 22:10.186
I'm Alan Shore.

22:10.221 --> 22:11.388
We've never met.

22:11.422 --> 22:13.023
That's a lovely name,

22:13.056 --> 22:14.358
Eve.

22:14.391 --> 22:15.191
Is it short for "Evening"?

22:15.226 --> 22:16.026
SELIG: Please,

22:16.059 --> 22:17.261
don't address my client.

22:18.529 --> 22:20.531
Oh, you look so bored.

22:20.564 --> 22:21.998
I'm about
to change that.

22:22.032 --> 22:23.166
Let's go in, shall we?

22:28.772 --> 22:31.007
What's he up to now?

22:31.041 --> 22:32.776
I have no idea.

22:35.479 --> 22:36.647
Okay, let's get started.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.114
This is my assistant, Tara.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.616
Tara, this--well, actually,

22:39.650 --> 22:42.819
I have nametags here
for all of us to wear.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.690
Alan Shore,
that would be mine.

22:46.723 --> 22:49.226
A. Selig,
obviously you.

22:49.260 --> 22:51.061
Ah, lying,
cheating adulterer,

22:51.094 --> 22:53.364
that would be yours, Eve.

22:53.397 --> 22:54.865
Look, Mr. Shore,

22:54.898 --> 22:55.932
we're more than familiar

22:55.966 --> 22:57.301
with your reputation.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.236
If you have
a proposal, make it.

22:59.270 --> 23:01.077
But let's fast-forward
through the brinkmanship.

23:01.111 --> 23:02.779
Brinkmanship,
is that a legal term?

23:02.813 --> 23:03.980
SELIG: Counsel,

23:04.014 --> 23:05.982
we're giving you
about 10 minutes.

23:06.016 --> 23:07.418
Tara.

23:08.919 --> 23:10.321
The proposal

23:10.354 --> 23:11.888
is a marital
settlement

23:11.922 --> 23:13.890
for $500,000.

23:13.924 --> 23:15.326
The settlement--
Let's go.

23:15.359 --> 23:16.092
Wait a second.

23:16.126 --> 23:17.728
Don't be rude.

23:17.761 --> 23:18.695
The marital estate

23:18.729 --> 23:21.232
is worth over $17 million.

23:21.265 --> 23:24.668
You're assuming
a valid union, Mr. Selig.

23:24.701 --> 23:25.502
Tara.

23:26.570 --> 23:28.104
Though rarely invoked,

23:28.138 --> 23:30.574
the Commonwealth does
recognize adultery as a means

23:30.607 --> 23:32.476
for annulling a marriage.
EVE: Is this your big plan?

23:32.509 --> 23:33.377
SELIG: They've tried
so many times.

23:33.410 --> 23:35.612
SHORE: Could she finish,
please?

23:35.646 --> 23:36.980
WILSON:
Though public policy does frown

23:37.013 --> 23:38.349
on vitiating marriage--

23:38.382 --> 23:40.183
This is a virtual
no-fault state.

23:40.217 --> 23:42.386
Justice Scalia's
dissent in Roma

23:42.419 --> 23:43.654
opens the door
for overturning--

23:43.687 --> 23:45.322
SELIG: If this is what
you called us up here for

23:45.356 --> 23:46.290
to present us with,

23:46.323 --> 23:47.524
this is ridiculous.

23:47.558 --> 23:48.759
We have--
SHORE: She has worked hard

23:48.792 --> 23:50.294
on this.
I refer you to the highlighted

23:50.327 --> 23:51.995
you're being rude
by not letting her finish.

23:52.028 --> 23:54.498
WILSON: ...which specifically
points out adultery and bigamy.

23:54.531 --> 23:57.033
SHORE: Tara, maybe
we should just present

23:57.067 --> 23:57.801
the facts.

23:57.834 --> 23:59.770
The law can be so tedious.

23:59.803 --> 24:02.446
Oh, here's a photo

24:02.479 --> 24:05.882
showing how your client's
yoga lessons paid off.

24:05.916 --> 24:08.184
Here's one for you, Eve.

24:08.219 --> 24:11.054
Look how close your foot is

24:11.087 --> 24:12.423
to your ear there.

24:12.456 --> 24:14.891
Wow, I wish
I could do that.

24:17.461 --> 24:18.161
(chuckles)

24:18.194 --> 24:19.330
I'm sorry.

24:19.363 --> 24:20.431
That's double-jointed,

24:20.464 --> 24:21.197
don't you think?

24:21.232 --> 24:22.165
Must be.

24:26.270 --> 24:28.204
SHORE: Huh.

24:28.239 --> 24:29.873
A woman of your talents
shouldn't be

24:29.906 --> 24:31.575
limited to the small screen,

24:31.608 --> 24:33.043
wouldn't you agree, Eve?

24:40.183 --> 24:42.553
Now, this may be
very low, I grant you,

24:42.586 --> 24:45.922
but the main point
to leave here with is...

24:47.858 --> 24:49.660
it's not beneath me.

24:50.794 --> 24:52.162
For an assistant
attorney general

24:52.195 --> 24:54.231
with even the slightest
political ambition,

24:54.265 --> 24:55.732
wouldn't it be awful

24:55.766 --> 24:57.234
to see these images pop up

24:57.268 --> 24:58.535
on the internet?

24:58.569 --> 24:59.703
SELIG: How you got
these images

24:59.736 --> 25:01.011
is gonna land you
in jail.

25:01.044 --> 25:02.112
SHORE: Good point,

25:02.145 --> 25:04.080
but if you're really
familiar with me,

25:04.114 --> 25:05.549
you know I'm not
afraid to go there.

25:05.582 --> 25:07.784
I might even enjoy
the change of pace.

25:09.686 --> 25:13.224
You hurt a friend
of mine, Eve.

25:13.257 --> 25:15.158
To err is human,
I'll admit,

25:15.191 --> 25:18.295
but getting even,
that's divine.

25:22.699 --> 25:24.000
(door opens)

25:24.034 --> 25:25.201
SELIG: Mr. Young,

25:25.236 --> 25:26.603
could you come
in here, please?

25:34.878 --> 25:37.248
My question is,
do these tactics reflect

25:37.281 --> 25:38.882
on your entire firm,

25:38.915 --> 25:40.917
or merely Alan Shore?

25:40.951 --> 25:42.853
Tara helped.

25:50.694 --> 25:53.297
I just went in
to scare him.

25:53.330 --> 25:56.166
Do you think
I'm that stupid?

25:56.199 --> 25:59.035
Walter, you were all set
to go to prison.

25:59.069 --> 26:00.103
Then once you heard

26:00.136 --> 26:02.012
Charlie Haden
was going to recover,

26:02.045 --> 26:04.281
suddenly, you want
your day in court.

26:04.315 --> 26:05.816
Why?

26:05.849 --> 26:07.518
So you could go kill him.

26:07.551 --> 26:10.487
I guess you feel real guilty
about helping me get out.

26:11.121 --> 26:13.357
I feel used, yes.

26:14.925 --> 26:16.560
But you know
what I mainly think?

26:17.694 --> 26:19.763
You'll spend the rest
of your life in jail.

26:20.931 --> 26:22.299
Is it worth it?

26:24.968 --> 26:27.671
I have no life,
Ms. Stringer.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.343
That man took my life

26:32.376 --> 26:34.411
when he killed
my daughter.

26:36.247 --> 26:38.682
She was the only thing...

26:38.715 --> 26:41.151
(breathing heavily)

26:41.184 --> 26:42.719
What about your sister?

26:42.753 --> 26:45.256
My sister
is no daughter.

26:47.758 --> 26:49.125
Now, look,

26:49.159 --> 26:51.862
I'm sorry
I got you involved.

26:51.895 --> 26:54.865
It wasn't my intent.

26:54.898 --> 26:57.100
If I'd killed him
the first time...

27:00.504 --> 27:02.679
What do you
want us to do?

27:02.713 --> 27:05.282
I really don't care.

27:05.316 --> 27:07.484
I'll go to prison.

27:07.518 --> 27:09.052
Just keep me out
of Cedar's.

27:09.085 --> 27:10.887
Because you'd be killed there?

27:12.789 --> 27:14.190
I did a little checking.

27:14.225 --> 27:15.859
The fire that killed
your daughter--

27:15.892 --> 27:18.094
the intended target
was an informer

27:18.128 --> 27:19.162
against Tommy Moynihan.

27:19.195 --> 27:21.398
Haden worked for Moynihan.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.568
So?

27:24.601 --> 27:26.437
STRINGER: Last year,
Moynihan was sentenced

27:26.470 --> 27:29.205
eight to ten at Cedar's
for something else.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.275
You're afraid
if you go to Cedar's,

27:31.308 --> 27:32.443
you'll be killed.

27:33.577 --> 27:35.279
I just want Plymouth

27:35.312 --> 27:38.048
so I can be close
to my sister.

27:38.081 --> 27:39.516
Right.

27:39.550 --> 27:40.817
Look...

27:43.520 --> 27:45.456
I don't want a trial.

27:47.724 --> 27:50.594
Make whatever deal you can.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.596
Let's just end this.

27:53.964 --> 27:56.900
(music playing)

28:08.084 --> 28:11.722
I'm confused about
whose turn it is to talk.

28:11.755 --> 28:13.657
It's my turn.

28:15.191 --> 28:16.327
Ah.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.462
This firm has pulled
a lot of stunts

28:18.495 --> 28:20.231
over the years.

28:20.264 --> 28:23.234
All of them have been
within the bounds of the law,

28:23.267 --> 28:24.901
even if barely.

28:26.637 --> 28:28.272
You bugged a hotel room

28:28.305 --> 28:30.407
to get illicit,
private pictures.

28:30.441 --> 28:32.543
You then used
those pictures

28:32.576 --> 28:33.977
to commit extortion.

28:34.010 --> 28:36.947
You have stepped
way outside the law.

28:36.980 --> 28:38.582
My bad.

28:40.917 --> 28:42.519
I need to hear
why you would commit

28:42.553 --> 28:43.487
such acts.

28:46.323 --> 28:48.158
Eve Haber
is a beautiful woman

28:48.191 --> 28:50.361
who used her sexuality
to dupe my client

28:50.394 --> 28:51.395
out of $7 million,
$8 million,

28:51.428 --> 28:54.465
maybe $9 million.

28:54.498 --> 28:57.334
She caused him
immeasurable pain

28:57.368 --> 28:59.270
and also broke his heart.

28:59.303 --> 29:02.346
She turned a kind,
loving man

29:02.379 --> 29:04.180
into something vengeful.

29:05.749 --> 29:09.220
And the only way
to kill a vindictive beast,

29:09.253 --> 29:11.322
believe it or not,
is to feed it.

29:13.357 --> 29:15.359
Dwight will gain
satisfaction here,

29:15.392 --> 29:17.394
albeit of a...

29:17.428 --> 29:19.396
most hollow variety...

29:20.364 --> 29:21.998
and he will heal.

29:24.034 --> 29:27.170
He will go on.

29:27.871 --> 29:31.375
But we need to go on,

29:31.408 --> 29:32.843
and that's not gonna happen

29:32.876 --> 29:36.046
if you continue
to do these kinds of things.

29:36.079 --> 29:37.648
I promise, Ellenor,

29:37.681 --> 29:40.150
only two or three more,
and then I'll stop.

29:40.183 --> 29:41.418
Alan...

29:42.586 --> 29:45.289
this isn't funny.

29:47.258 --> 29:49.059
No, I suppose it isn't.

29:49.092 --> 29:52.028
(music playing)

30:01.878 --> 30:05.015
Eugene, I gave you my word

30:05.048 --> 30:06.850
that I'd sooner
take myself down

30:06.883 --> 30:08.785
than this firm,
I meant that.

30:11.087 --> 30:12.656
Well, you're
taking yourself down.

30:12.689 --> 30:14.625
Don't you get that?

30:16.360 --> 30:18.995
And you're taking us down
with you.

30:22.966 --> 30:24.535
Now what?

30:39.950 --> 30:41.418
(door slams close)

30:43.220 --> 30:46.156
(music playing)

30:54.698 --> 30:57.033
Why such a short window
on this? Why?

30:57.067 --> 30:59.536
BERLUTI: Because
the client wants it done, Alex.

30:59.570 --> 31:01.845
Look, this is a gift.

31:01.878 --> 31:03.914
The man commits
a first-degree murder,

31:03.947 --> 31:05.816
goes to a medium-security
facility.

31:05.849 --> 31:07.218
Who's getting
the gift here?

31:07.251 --> 31:10.186
STRINGER: We have
a possible insanity defense,

31:10.221 --> 31:12.055
not to mention
a potential self-defense--

31:12.088 --> 31:13.424
Don't insult me, Jamie.

31:13.457 --> 31:15.259
BERLUTI: This isn't open
and shut for you.

31:15.292 --> 31:17.060
He is very sympathetic.

31:17.093 --> 31:19.230
Yes, as vigilantes go,
he's adorable, but--

31:19.263 --> 31:20.964
BERLUTI: We're offering you
a plea that takes him

31:20.997 --> 31:22.366
off the street for life.

31:22.399 --> 31:23.700
And suppose I find out later

31:23.734 --> 31:25.436
that he's really
a professional hit man, who--

31:25.469 --> 31:27.904
BERLUTI: Oh, come on.

31:27.938 --> 31:29.373
If the facts change,

31:29.406 --> 31:31.675
you can undo the plea
on grounds of fraud

31:31.708 --> 31:33.877
and send him to trial.

31:33.910 --> 31:35.446
Why are we wasting
time here?

31:35.479 --> 31:37.614
The guy is willing
to go to prison.

31:37.648 --> 31:40.284
He'd just like to be
near his sister.

31:40.317 --> 31:41.352
If he goes to Cedar's,

31:41.385 --> 31:43.387
Tommy Moynihan
will probably kill him.

31:45.021 --> 31:47.424
And you'd be willing
to enter a plea today?

31:47.458 --> 31:49.025
Yes.

31:52.263 --> 31:54.665
You'll be transferred
within the hour.

31:54.698 --> 31:57.100
Thank you.

31:57.133 --> 31:58.402
Thank you both.

31:59.470 --> 32:02.078
Can I ask you something?

32:04.315 --> 32:06.883
Did it make
you feel better

32:06.917 --> 32:10.221
when you killed him?

32:10.254 --> 32:12.356
Did it bring you relief?

32:13.424 --> 32:15.959
I don't think I'm capable

32:15.992 --> 32:18.595
of feeling anything,
Ms. Stringer.

32:20.096 --> 32:23.834
I suppose that's
what allowed me to survive.

32:27.538 --> 32:29.306
I wish you well.

32:29.340 --> 32:31.308
Thank you...

32:32.643 --> 32:35.312
again.

32:35.346 --> 32:36.647
DWIGHT: Thank you both.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.049
I can't say I'm terribly proud
of our tactics,

32:39.082 --> 32:41.618
but I'm glad
to have mitigated,

32:41.652 --> 32:43.454
at least,
the financial damage.

32:43.487 --> 32:45.256
As soon as the documents
are drafted,

32:45.289 --> 32:46.957
we'll have you back in
for execution.

32:46.990 --> 32:48.191
DWIGHT: Okay.

32:50.527 --> 32:53.129
I don't know how you do
the things you do, Alan.

32:53.163 --> 32:55.366
It's not with mirrors,
I assure you.

32:55.399 --> 32:56.900
That I believe.

32:58.569 --> 33:00.337
I'll see you both soon.

33:00.371 --> 33:01.378
SHORE: Yep.

33:13.257 --> 33:15.692
Here we sit
in triumph.

33:15.726 --> 33:17.861
(sighs)

33:17.894 --> 33:19.830
Shall we get drunk?

33:21.232 --> 33:22.499
Winston Churchill said

33:22.533 --> 33:24.235
that he would drink
in victory

33:24.268 --> 33:27.003
because he deserved it

33:27.037 --> 33:29.373
and in defeat...

33:29.406 --> 33:31.174
because he needed it.

33:33.377 --> 33:35.246
Somehow, I feel
that we qualify here

33:35.279 --> 33:37.047
on both counts.

33:38.181 --> 33:40.284
(sighs)

33:46.623 --> 33:49.025
You're a very interesting
woman, aren't you?

33:52.929 --> 33:55.131
I find victory to be

33:55.165 --> 33:58.302
extremely lonely without--

33:58.335 --> 33:59.670
what's the word?

34:02.713 --> 34:03.880
Sex.

34:08.485 --> 34:11.722
Would that be considered

34:11.755 --> 34:13.989
assertive conduct?

34:14.024 --> 34:16.527
Well, there's
nobody else here,

34:16.560 --> 34:19.730
just you, me...

34:19.763 --> 34:20.996
and this--

34:21.031 --> 34:23.266
this big conference table.

34:28.804 --> 34:30.407
Would you like
to have sex

34:30.440 --> 34:32.842
on the table, Alan?

34:45.054 --> 34:48.725
That would definitely be
considered a first move.

34:55.998 --> 34:58.935
(music playing)

35:03.480 --> 35:06.450
(inhales)

35:23.066 --> 35:25.035
You see,
the thing is...

35:27.137 --> 35:29.573
if you'd like to go
to a nice restaurant...

35:30.807 --> 35:32.843
share a lovely
bottle of wine...

35:34.511 --> 35:36.112
caress a little
in a taxicab

35:36.146 --> 35:38.782
on the way back
to my place or yours,

35:40.551 --> 35:43.387
I might enjoy having sex
with you tonight.

35:46.357 --> 35:48.024
But you don't want that.

35:49.826 --> 35:51.895
You want to do it
on a conference table

35:51.928 --> 35:53.830
because it's debased.

35:55.198 --> 35:57.033
It's commensurate
with your self-esteem,

35:57.067 --> 35:58.902
which always seems
to nose-dive when you behave

35:58.935 --> 36:01.177
as you did in this case.

36:03.113 --> 36:05.081
You're not going
to find some twisted sense

36:05.115 --> 36:06.483
of self-loathing
affirmation

36:06.517 --> 36:08.519
on that table
with me.

36:14.991 --> 36:16.727
I tell you what,
though...

36:18.829 --> 36:20.564
get some help...

36:24.568 --> 36:27.003
and then ask me out
to dinner sometime.

36:28.405 --> 36:31.342
(music playing)

36:52.763 --> 36:53.764
STRINGER: Yes, ma'am.

36:53.797 --> 36:54.798
That's right.

36:54.831 --> 36:55.966
Well, it won't be necessary now,

36:55.999 --> 36:57.868
since--
that's right--

36:57.901 --> 37:00.070
you can go
visit him now.

37:00.103 --> 37:01.578
My pleasure.

37:01.611 --> 37:03.480
Thank you again
for returning my call.

37:05.382 --> 37:06.516
Walter's sister--

37:06.550 --> 37:07.984
I finally made contact.

37:08.017 --> 37:09.018
Oh.

37:10.354 --> 37:12.256
Here's something weird--

37:12.289 --> 37:13.957
she lives in Brighton.

37:13.990 --> 37:15.992
Why would Walter say
she lives in Plymouth?

37:16.025 --> 37:16.960
I don't know.

37:16.993 --> 37:17.827
Maybe he just wanted

37:17.861 --> 37:18.728
to go to Plymouth.

37:20.063 --> 37:21.031
But why?

37:21.064 --> 37:22.566
There are medium-security
prisons

37:22.599 --> 37:23.834
which are softer
than Plymouth,

37:23.867 --> 37:24.901
with better facilities.

37:24.935 --> 37:27.271
Personally,
I'd go to Norfolk.

37:33.043 --> 37:34.345
Give me your phone.

37:34.378 --> 37:37.314
(music playing)

37:38.649 --> 37:39.716
What?

37:43.119 --> 37:44.988
Plymouth, Massachusetts,

37:45.021 --> 37:46.723
Department of Corrections.

37:53.897 --> 37:56.767
Thomas Moynihan.

37:56.800 --> 37:57.968
Yes.

37:58.001 --> 38:00.944
(music playing)

38:03.714 --> 38:06.082
Transferred
three weeks ago?

38:07.251 --> 38:09.052
Okay, look,

38:09.085 --> 38:10.687
this man is in danger.

38:10.721 --> 38:13.257
A prisoner by the name
of Walter Josephson

38:13.290 --> 38:15.426
was transferred there today.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.593
Josephson.

38:23.133 --> 38:25.001
Tommy Moynihan?

38:28.204 --> 38:29.406
Yes.

38:31.908 --> 38:35.446
You need to find one
or the other or both...

38:35.479 --> 38:36.547
now.

38:39.983 --> 38:42.919
(music playing)

39:05.015 --> 39:07.984
JOSEPHSON: It was on his orders

39:08.018 --> 39:10.554
that Haden lit that match.

39:13.590 --> 39:15.659
You knew he was here

39:15.692 --> 39:17.160
all the time.

39:18.462 --> 39:21.398
They can send me
to Cedar's now, Jimmy.

39:22.799 --> 39:25.135
I've made my peace.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.635
Hey, sexy.

39:58.669 --> 40:00.003
Looking to party?

40:00.036 --> 40:01.778
(chuckles)

40:01.812 --> 40:03.113
What's your name?

40:03.146 --> 40:05.181
Annie. What's yours?

40:05.216 --> 40:06.583
Eugene.

40:07.984 --> 40:08.952
Get in the car,
Annie.

40:08.985 --> 40:10.654
It looks cold
out there.

40:15.292 --> 40:17.828
So, do your parents know
you're out this late, Annie?

40:17.861 --> 40:20.964
Ooh, Eugene, you're funny.

40:20.997 --> 40:23.900
I love funny, sexy men.

40:23.934 --> 40:24.935
Your place or mine?

40:24.968 --> 40:25.836
My place?

40:25.869 --> 40:26.870
Your place?

40:28.705 --> 40:30.774
I thought maybe
we should just drive around

40:30.807 --> 40:32.709
and see what happens.

40:32.743 --> 40:34.478
ANNIE: Drive around?

40:34.511 --> 40:36.347
All right, look...

40:36.380 --> 40:37.381
the ones who want that

40:37.414 --> 40:39.350
usually just want to talk.

40:39.383 --> 40:40.384
I don't talk,

40:40.417 --> 40:41.785
and I'm not
into wasting time.

40:43.053 --> 40:44.421
Then, perhaps,
you should get out

40:44.455 --> 40:45.756
of the car, Annie,

40:46.990 --> 40:48.525
because although
I have no interest

40:48.559 --> 40:49.926
in talking to you,

40:51.895 --> 40:53.196
I've always
taken great pleasure

40:53.230 --> 40:54.831
in wasting time.

40:59.503 --> 41:01.245
(chuckles)

41:07.150 --> 41:07.918
(car door closes)

41:28.572 --> 41:31.508
(music playing)

41:52.596 --> 41:53.297
BOY: Score, score!

41:53.330 --> 41:54.965
WOMAN: Stinker!

41:56.132 --> 41:59.035
(music playing)
