WEBVTT

00:08.486 --> 00:11.576
BLAKE:
Alex and Ellie-Rose

00:11.620 --> 00:15.058
are serving salmon.

00:15.102 --> 00:18.061
So we could do,
like, a pinot gris

00:18.105 --> 00:20.498
or maybe just, like, a light
red, like a pinot noir, or...

00:20.542 --> 00:21.934
I don't know. We
can go off the grid

00:21.978 --> 00:22.979
and do something
effervescent.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.067
Yeah, just like you
in the mornings.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.460
[chuckles]

00:25.503 --> 00:27.505
Please just weigh in so
I don't have to decide.

00:27.549 --> 00:28.985
I will drink anything
that pairs well

00:29.029 --> 00:30.117
with an inverted yield curve.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.553
[laughs softly]

00:31.596 --> 00:33.859
Leaving finance was
the smartest thing I ever did.

00:33.903 --> 00:36.036
Well, second smartest.Mm. Ah...

00:36.079 --> 00:37.341
Coffee breath. Thank you.Mmm.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.169
[pounding on door]

00:39.213 --> 00:41.998
Did you use the elliptical?Yeah.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.653
Did you fix the elliptical?No.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.089
Which means 304 is about
to give you an earful

00:46.133 --> 00:47.569
for the unexpected wake-me-up.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.179
Oh, this woman is a nightmare.
Just back me up, please.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.529
Yeah. Right behind you.

00:51.573 --> 00:53.662
Yes.
Blake Moran?

00:53.705 --> 00:54.880
Yes.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.273
Special Agent Belstaff
with the FBI.

00:56.317 --> 00:58.623
We have a warrant for the
search of your premises.

00:58.667 --> 01:01.104
Please step back.Uh...

01:01.148 --> 01:03.454
Hey, uh, this is a
private residence, okay?I understand.

01:03.498 --> 01:06.109
Trevor, don't say anything.
Just let them do their thing.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.767
Russell, hi.

01:11.810 --> 01:15.205
Yeah, we got a, um,
little s-situation.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.251
The FBI is part of the DOJ,
and the DOJ

01:17.294 --> 01:19.775
is run by the attorney general,
who answers to POTUS, so...

01:19.818 --> 01:21.603
Guys, I think......stop me
if I'm missing something,

01:21.646 --> 01:24.475
but if A.G. Lambert
was read in on a warrant

01:24.519 --> 01:26.129
to raid the residence

01:26.173 --> 01:27.957
of the aide-de-camp
of the president

01:28.000 --> 01:29.393
without so much
as notifying her,

01:29.437 --> 01:31.003
he should be shot into space.What you're missing

01:31.047 --> 01:33.136
is her internal
mandate to pursue

01:33.180 --> 01:34.964
the investigation
wherever it leads.Guys, listen...

01:35.007 --> 01:37.575
Hanson is setting a trap.MIKE:
Huh.

01:37.619 --> 01:40.752
Referring this matter to Justice
for a concurrent investigation

01:40.796 --> 01:42.798
was a brilliant overreach.

01:42.841 --> 01:45.279
Because he knows the A.G.
has to carry water for him.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.932
The slightest opposition

01:46.976 --> 01:49.152
from the administration
will smack of obstruction.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.154
Which means under
no circumstances

01:51.198 --> 01:52.634
can we move to
quash the warrant.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.810
Except the more rope we give
Hanson, the easier it is

01:54.853 --> 01:56.290
to fashion a noose.Guys!

01:57.682 --> 01:59.423
The only one being fit
for a noose here is me.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.122
Okay? They-they took
my phone, my laptop.

02:02.165 --> 02:04.080
Six years
of-of unclassified documents...

02:04.124 --> 02:05.473
Six years?

02:05.516 --> 02:07.475
What kind of
demented pack rat are you?

02:07.518 --> 02:09.259
Okay, look,
I knew she was special

02:09.303 --> 02:10.913
from the minute
I started working for her.

02:10.956 --> 02:12.523
I-I had
a front-row seat

02:12.567 --> 02:14.003
from day one.

02:15.613 --> 02:18.094
I was going to write a book

02:18.138 --> 02:20.140
about the secretary

02:20.183 --> 02:22.359
when she finished public
service, which became a book

02:22.403 --> 02:24.361
about the first
female president.

02:24.405 --> 02:27.886
Which i-is now a book about
a starry-eyed kid from Newton

02:27.930 --> 02:29.453
who follows his dreams
to Sing Sing.

02:29.497 --> 02:32.021
You're not going to Sing Sing.MIKE:
Right.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.414
That's a state facility.
You'll be doing federal time.

02:33.457 --> 02:36.547
Oh, God!

02:36.591 --> 02:39.333
Blake, look at me.

02:39.376 --> 02:43.032
Have you ever broken the law
during your government tenure?

02:43.075 --> 02:44.816
Absolutely not.

02:44.860 --> 02:45.991
Then you have
no exposure.

02:46.035 --> 02:48.037
It's a fishing expedition.

02:48.080 --> 02:52.041
Nothing more.The question is,
what is Hanson fishing for?

02:52.084 --> 02:54.174
He already grilled Blake
for 12 hours.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.219
OLIVIA:
I think Blake's role

02:56.263 --> 03:01.181
as the president's unofficial
archivist may be an open secret,

03:01.224 --> 03:03.183
which is why
the warrant's so broad.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.533
This search is a naked pretext
to breathe life

03:05.576 --> 03:07.187
into an investigation
that was flatlining.

03:07.230 --> 03:11.147
And is suddenly metastasizing.

03:13.149 --> 03:15.238
We walled off the president.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.676
But we may be
past that stage now.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.071
I'll read her in.

03:22.114 --> 03:24.073
Thank you.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.732
[music playing faintly]

03:38.261 --> 03:39.828
Mia Costello.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.699
Yes?
Jason McCord.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.093
I know. Hi.

03:44.136 --> 03:46.095
I'm sorry to bother you,
I'm just such a big fan.

03:46.138 --> 03:48.358
Cambridge Rubric'sone
of my favorite blogs.

03:48.402 --> 03:51.100
Thank you.
You've-- you got
this great voice.

03:51.143 --> 03:54.103
You know? It's, uh, it's like
Maureen Dowd meets Ronan Farrow.

03:54.146 --> 03:55.757
Red eye.That's nice of you to say.

03:55.800 --> 03:59.064
Are you okay with a little
friendly criticism?

03:59.108 --> 04:01.066
Sure.'Cause it's-it's quibbling,
really.

04:01.110 --> 04:03.547
Um...
What?

04:03.591 --> 04:05.767
Your last column.

04:05.810 --> 04:11.207
You called my mom a "corrupt,
unqualified crypto-fascist."

04:13.078 --> 04:15.211
It was an opinion piece.Yeah.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.300
And the accompanying cartoon
of her in fetish wear

04:17.344 --> 04:19.171
being whipped by Senator Hanson,
that was...

04:19.215 --> 04:21.043
Satire.Satire. Yeah.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.177
But, you know, it could be
misconstrued by some

04:25.221 --> 04:26.396
as misogyny.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.181
Or even slander.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.446
You know, Jason,
your mom is a public figure.

04:32.489 --> 04:35.710
Yeah. And the Rubricis a
nonpartisan student publication,

04:35.753 --> 04:38.234
yet no other politician comes in
for this type of treatment.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.888
Well, no other politician
is president.

04:39.931 --> 04:42.499
The first female president. Hmm?

04:43.544 --> 04:45.328
Yeah, I think I get the drift.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.330
There's no drift.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.549
I mean, Elizabeth McCord's

04:48.592 --> 04:50.202
the most powerful person
in the world.

04:50.246 --> 04:51.813
She can handle
a little incoming, so...

04:51.856 --> 04:53.249
BARISTA:
Jason?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.730
Here you go, man.I got to run.

04:55.773 --> 04:59.603
Detail gets kind
of... itchy

04:59.647 --> 05:01.649
when I stand around,
so...

05:01.692 --> 05:03.259
I'm looking forward
to your next issue.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.482
I-It's a nonstarter.I'm not telling you

05:08.525 --> 05:10.614
not to go
to the Correspondents' Dinner.You're telling me

05:10.658 --> 05:13.400
to be pulled away
five minutes after I arrive.

05:13.443 --> 05:15.184
Which means you were there.

05:15.227 --> 05:16.838
As our dutiful White House
photographer will document.

05:16.881 --> 05:19.536
The dinner is a
hallowed tradition.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.756
Presidents attend

05:21.799 --> 05:25.716
whether their political
fortunes are rising or falling.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.978
Reagan bailed.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.285
Because he was shot.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.547
Okay, you're nervous
about telling jokes anyway,

05:30.591 --> 05:32.332
which you should be
because you're not funny.

05:32.375 --> 05:35.204
What?
I-- hmm.

05:35.247 --> 05:37.249
That is so not true.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.251
I have chops.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.428
Serious chops.

05:41.471 --> 05:42.646
And I've been working
on my monologue.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.648
And it's actually,
it's pretty good.

05:44.692 --> 05:47.738
Be that as it may, this dinner
is not exactly ideal timing.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.001
You just locked up
a reporter.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.568
Valerie Guillen, remember?

05:51.612 --> 05:53.004
And pardoned her.

05:53.048 --> 05:55.180
Even if people aren't talking
about your predilection

05:55.224 --> 05:57.922
for jailing reporters,
they will be talking about

05:57.966 --> 05:59.184
the search warrant
that was executed

05:59.228 --> 06:01.012
on your aide's
private residence.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.667
Look, I'm not gonna worry about
a stunt that was engineered

06:03.711 --> 06:07.410
to give a failed
investigation oxygen.It won't play as a stunt.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.238
The White House press corps is
not exactly home team right now.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.675
It'll play as an escalation
of a news cycle

06:11.719 --> 06:14.417
we've been trying
to change for months.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.550
It'll juice impeachment talk,
cast a shadow

06:16.593 --> 06:18.421
of a looming
constitutional crisis.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.770
And then there's the bad stuff.

06:19.814 --> 06:22.120
So it's the perfect time
to inject some levity.

06:22.164 --> 06:23.905
But, Bess, you're not funny.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.167
[laughs]:
Well...

06:25.210 --> 06:27.256
Russell.Mike's right.
Not your strong suit.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.432
Listen, I think
we've caught a break.

06:29.476 --> 06:32.566
After a month and a half
of intensive investigations

06:32.609 --> 06:34.176
by our intelligence services,

06:34.219 --> 06:37.353
we've isolated the culprits
of Iran's hack of our election.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.835
I'm just getting word that this
morning, a federal grand jury

06:40.878 --> 06:43.403
has issued indictments
of five Iranian nationals

06:43.446 --> 06:45.361
Ah...for election interference.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.145
Finally. Oh, uh, Blake.

06:47.189 --> 06:49.147
Alerting President Shiraz's
office.

06:49.191 --> 06:50.714
Yeah. Also, can I get the, uh...

06:50.758 --> 06:52.324
The full background files
on the Iranians?

06:52.368 --> 06:54.370
But I'm gonna need...Photos as well.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.242
How are you doing?

06:57.286 --> 07:00.245
Uh, nothing to brighten
your morning

07:00.289 --> 07:04.162
like a battalion of Feds
rifling through your underwear.

07:04.206 --> 07:06.164
The worst is behind you.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.470
Yeah. Oh.

07:07.514 --> 07:10.342
Underwear, behind. Nice.

07:10.386 --> 07:13.694
I am so gonna rock
that ballroom.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.783
SHIRAZ:
You are seeking extradition

07:15.826 --> 07:19.003
of Reza Mousavi,
our Quds Force commander.

07:19.047 --> 07:22.267
For his criminal role
in masterminding

07:22.311 --> 07:25.140
a cyber attack
on my electoral opponent.

07:25.183 --> 07:26.489
Elizabeth,

07:26.533 --> 07:28.578
I'm an ally, not a foe.

07:28.622 --> 07:31.668
We have done
such important work together.

07:31.712 --> 07:35.324
The rapprochement between our
countries, the nuclear treaty.

07:35.367 --> 07:39.371
All of which you jeopardized
by tampering with our election.

07:39.415 --> 07:40.764
This alleged tampering--

07:40.808 --> 07:44.072
which we strenuously deny--
was on your behalf.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.422
It's perverse you would seek
to punish us for your success.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.860
What's perverse is assuming
that I'd endorse behavior

07:49.904 --> 07:51.862
merely because it benefited me.

07:51.906 --> 07:54.299
Interfering with our elections

07:54.343 --> 07:56.737
was the act of an enemy.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.869
That is reckless talk.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.828
Not as reckless as your breach
of our democracy.

08:00.871 --> 08:05.310
You have 48 hours to extradite
the people responsible,

08:05.354 --> 08:10.054
or the price that Iran pays
will grow exponentially steeper.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.844
Well, you cornered him.

08:16.887 --> 08:19.803
And cornered prey
either rolls over or...

08:19.847 --> 08:22.414
Or lashes out.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.416
We'll monitor developments.

08:25.461 --> 08:26.854
DMITRI:
You're already dressed,

08:26.897 --> 08:29.291
which means you're not
coming back to bed.

08:29.334 --> 08:34.557
I would love to, but I am,
I'm pretty late as it is

08:34.601 --> 08:36.559
and I'm actually not done
with this yet, so...

08:36.603 --> 08:38.343
Yeah. Sorry I kept you.No.

08:38.387 --> 08:39.910
I think we kept
each other, right?[chuckles]

08:39.954 --> 08:41.912
Yeah, that's been happening
a lot lately, huh?[laughs]

08:41.956 --> 08:43.087
Oy-- hey.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.525
[laughs]:
This is, this is important.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.527
Hey. I have an idea.Okay.

08:47.570 --> 08:53.228
How about... we...
go out this evening?

08:53.271 --> 08:57.798
Uh, yeah, if I don't
have to work late again.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.801
Take a stand.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.890
Tell them that you're
the president's daughter.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.022
Are you upset?

09:05.066 --> 09:07.024
No, I'm... It's not you.

09:07.068 --> 09:10.767
It's just... we haven't
left the bedroom in weeks.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.377
[laughs]

09:12.421 --> 09:13.988
Are you seriously complaining
that you're oversexed?

09:14.031 --> 09:15.163
No, of course not.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.904
I'm just beginning
to feel like a kept man.

09:16.947 --> 09:17.861
Ah...Okay. Okay.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.297
Cabin fever. I get it.

09:19.341 --> 09:21.909
I will tell the office
that I have a hard out.

09:21.952 --> 09:23.911
Good.
Okay.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.695
All right, I've got
another one for you.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.697
Odontalgia.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.525
Odontalgia.

09:29.569 --> 09:34.878
O-D-O-N-T-A-L-G-I-A.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.228
Odontalgia.

09:37.272 --> 09:38.839
Right again.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.449
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:40.492 --> 09:44.192
your national spelling bee
champion Oscar Rubis.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.194
[applause]Congratulations, sir.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.022
Very well done.

09:48.065 --> 09:51.025
The president and our champion
will take a few questions.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.417
Madam President...Keira.

09:52.461 --> 09:55.682
President McCord, as a
CIA operative in Baghdad,

09:55.725 --> 09:57.379
did you order the torture

09:57.422 --> 10:01.035
of Safeer Al-Jamil while
he was in CIA custody?

10:01.078 --> 10:02.384
We're taking questions about the
administration's educational...

10:02.427 --> 10:04.168
STEVE:
What's your response
to the allegation

10:04.212 --> 10:06.257
that you assaulted Philippine
President Datu Andrada

10:06.301 --> 10:07.607
after he made an
unwanted sexual advance?

10:07.650 --> 10:08.912
That's all we have
for you today.

10:08.956 --> 10:09.913
[speaks indistinctly]Thank you, everyone.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.350
[overlapping chatter]

10:12.394 --> 10:14.657
Uh, Russell, do
you have a second?

10:14.701 --> 10:16.616
Not now.I know where they, um,

10:16.659 --> 10:19.009
[whispers]: I think I know
where they got their questions.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.885
Come with me.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.236
♪

10:37.637 --> 10:39.987
The oppo was on a flash drive
given to me

10:40.030 --> 10:41.466
by Neal Shin from the Chronicle,

10:41.510 --> 10:43.730
when he shadowed you
three years ago.

10:43.773 --> 10:47.255
In what universe is
squirreling away material

10:47.298 --> 10:50.214
whose only use could be
to undermine the president

10:50.258 --> 10:51.433
a good idea?

10:51.476 --> 10:52.652
Boswell here's writing
a tell-all,

10:52.695 --> 10:54.349
remember?Shin told me to keep it safe.

10:54.392 --> 10:57.178
That one day the secretary might
need what's on the drive.

10:57.221 --> 10:59.180
He meant she needed it
buried at sea,

10:59.223 --> 11:00.703
not enshrined in your museum.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.749
It was in a safe.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.796
Ma'am, I'm really sorry.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.711
It's all right, Blake.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.800
I mean, you couldn't have
anticipated the warrant

11:10.844 --> 11:12.976
or its scope.Yeah, or that some ally

11:13.020 --> 11:14.978
of Hanson's in the
FBI is obviously

11:15.022 --> 11:16.327
leaking to the press.

11:16.371 --> 11:17.764
MIKE: The timing's right
out of Hanson's playbook.

11:17.807 --> 11:20.157
Releasing dirt just before
the Correspondents' Dinner,

11:20.201 --> 11:21.855
he's chumming the waters.

11:21.898 --> 11:22.856
Thank you, Blake.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.422
Yeah, thanks, Blake.

11:25.728 --> 11:26.947
Ma'am.

11:31.647 --> 11:35.259
Olivia, I want I.G. to
investigate who at Justice

11:35.303 --> 11:36.565
was behind the leak.

11:36.608 --> 11:40.917
I mean... that is a
dangerous partisan move

11:40.961 --> 11:43.485
for a department that is
supposed to be apolitical.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.400
I'll take care of it.On the down low, please.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.793
Otherwise the president
looks like the captain

11:46.836 --> 11:48.838
of the Good Ship Paranoid.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.753
We have a massive
political problem.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.147
Daisy's resignation was
blunting Hanson's momentum,

11:53.190 --> 11:55.236
but this raid jump-starts
his investigation.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.846
And it's the first salvo

11:56.890 --> 12:00.284
of a concurrent FBI inquiry
that could drag on for months.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.722
So now we're fighting
a two-fronted war.

12:02.765 --> 12:03.984
We should reach out
to Hanson's camp,

12:04.027 --> 12:05.986
see what he wants
for a truce.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.252
Russell, put out a feeler,
but let's keep in mind

12:11.295 --> 12:14.516
that a truce is not surrender.

12:14.559 --> 12:17.780
Well, we have a foreign
relations problem, too.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.129
Shiraz might be...[phone chimes]

12:19.173 --> 12:20.609
less likely to cave

12:20.652 --> 12:23.917
if he thinks you're
under siege at home.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.009
Make that willbe less likely.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.188
HILL: Two hours ago,
Hezbollah cells in Lebanon fired

12:34.231 --> 12:35.537
26 mobile-launched

12:35.580 --> 12:38.018
surface-to-air missiles
into Northern Israel.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.497
Fatalities?

12:39.541 --> 12:41.891
Three dead in Nahariya.
Millions of dollars in damage.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.938
Israel has already responded
by blowing up

12:44.981 --> 12:47.897
a Hezbollah radar installation

12:47.941 --> 12:51.335
and two suspected weapons
manufacturing sites in Dahieh.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.946
Well, I guess we have
Iran's response

12:52.989 --> 12:54.469
to your ultimatum, madam.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.950
They're using their terrorist
proxy to attack Israel,

12:56.993 --> 13:00.214
sending a message that they will
drag the region into chaos

13:00.257 --> 13:02.564
if we don't back off
our extradition request.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.827
Did you reach out
to Foreign Minister Tousi?

13:04.871 --> 13:06.524
My Iranian counterpart
professes surprise.

13:06.568 --> 13:11.399
He claims Iran has no influence
over renegade cells.

13:11.442 --> 13:14.097
HILL:
Shiraz is squeezing you,
Madam President,

13:14.141 --> 13:16.056
betting your domestic
distractions will weaken

13:16.099 --> 13:18.145
your appetite
for international conflict.

13:18.188 --> 13:20.277
ELIZABETH:
Well, unfortunately for him,

13:20.321 --> 13:22.062
I can walk and chew gum
at the same time.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.281
How's the rial doing, Susan?

13:24.325 --> 13:25.979
It's in free fall.
The Iranian economy is

13:26.022 --> 13:26.980
teetering on the brink
of collapse.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.938
Reach out to the G8 members.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.374
I want to turn the screws,

13:30.418 --> 13:32.899
step up multilateral sanctions.Immediately.

13:32.942 --> 13:34.901
And add the head
of the Revolutionary Guard

13:34.944 --> 13:37.120
and the Speaker of
the Iranian Parliament

13:37.164 --> 13:39.557
to the SDN and Blocked
Persons List.Yes, ma'am.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.646
Russell, you've got
a personal relationship

13:41.690 --> 13:44.040
with the Israeli
prime minister.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.999
You tell him
to keep his powder dry.

13:46.042 --> 13:48.523
Doron will do that
for only so long.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.525
We're playing with fire here.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.657
I know.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.662
Coffee this late?

13:57.706 --> 13:59.490
You're gonna be up all night.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.231
It's not coffee.
Oh.

14:01.275 --> 14:05.496
It's a perfectly alkaline
chicory matcha superdrink

14:05.540 --> 14:08.935
with ayurvedic herbs that
Chef Cindy whipped up for me.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.676
Whoa. What does
that taste like?

14:11.720 --> 14:14.941
Despair.
[laughs]

14:14.984 --> 14:16.290
It's good to see you.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.901
Hmm. Oh. [exclaims]
Yeah.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.033
[chuckles]
Yum.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.426
Yeah, I'm sorry I've
been a little scarce

14:22.470 --> 14:24.907
the past few weeks.Well, I was young once, too.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.082
[chuckles]

14:26.126 --> 14:28.432
So, how's Dmitri?

14:28.476 --> 14:31.174
He's good.
Good.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.960
He's great.
[laughs]

14:34.003 --> 14:37.659
Actually, can I ask you...?

14:37.702 --> 14:41.010
You know what,
if you're too busy...

14:41.054 --> 14:44.013
No, I-- Dish away.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.885
So...

14:45.928 --> 14:49.192
Dmitri wants to do, um,

14:49.236 --> 14:52.239
traditional couples stuff,
like, in public.

14:52.282 --> 14:55.982
Swell.
Yeah, except
here's the thing.

14:56.025 --> 15:00.073
I, I was just with
Griffin. I mean, God.

15:00.116 --> 15:04.164
And our relationship was
all over Instagram

15:04.207 --> 15:06.383
and-and tabloids,
and, like, what,

15:06.427 --> 15:08.168
a few weeks later
I'm coming out like,

15:08.211 --> 15:10.039
"Hey, here's my new..."What's your concern?

15:10.083 --> 15:12.912
I mean, judgment.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.132
What's your real concern?

15:17.917 --> 15:21.398
Stevie, you are the most
private of my three kids.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.183
And you're also the one

15:23.226 --> 15:26.795
who cares the least
about what other people think.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.188
Yeah.

15:28.231 --> 15:32.105
I guess it's more
about what I think.

15:32.148 --> 15:34.150
Which is?

15:35.238 --> 15:38.415
That I was devastated when
this didn't work before.

15:39.503 --> 15:44.813
And if I commit again
and we fail...

15:44.856 --> 15:47.990
You'll take it even harder.Yeah.

15:48.034 --> 15:51.167
Because this time,
you know,

15:51.211 --> 15:54.257
there's nobody
to blame but me.

15:54.301 --> 15:56.956
Oh, sweetie.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.958
It's scary.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.135
Try terrifying.

16:04.093 --> 16:07.618
Love is all about...

16:09.185 --> 16:14.016
You have to risk everything...

16:14.060 --> 16:15.539
to gain everything.

16:15.583 --> 16:18.803
Do you think that
we'll make it?

16:20.240 --> 16:24.592
Well, I think that...

16:24.635 --> 16:26.898
you should take it
one step at a time.

16:28.813 --> 16:31.164
Go to dinner,

16:31.207 --> 16:34.167
then come back and tell me
what real food tastes like.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.951
[laughs]

16:39.999 --> 16:42.218
I was just going
to come to see you.[sighs] I was crawling

16:42.262 --> 16:44.133

Yeah. Because I'm not already

17:27.133 --> 17:29.222
in Dutch enough
with the press corps,

17:29.265 --> 17:31.615
who I will be schmoozing
tomorrow night.

17:31.659 --> 17:32.834
Yep.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.879
He is going to issue an apology.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.055
Yes, agreed.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.230
Then we are going
to shave his head

17:37.273 --> 17:38.883
and ship him
off to military school.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.190
Well, h-he's not 12,
but that is a good thought.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.410
Madam President, you're needed
in the Sit Room immediately.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.629
Okay, listen, I will have him
on the next train down here

17:45.673 --> 17:48.110
to give us time to give him
a proper neck-wringing.Okay.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.634
You just go save the world.Okay, okay. Yep, yep, yep.

17:50.678 --> 17:53.202
At 9:00 a.m.
Greenwich Mean Time,

17:53.246 --> 17:56.423
the G8 member nations
notified Tehran

17:56.466 --> 18:00.209
that the sanctions on the Shiraz
regime were being trebled.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.384
RUSSELL:
Three hours later,

18:01.428 --> 18:03.082
the U.K.'s two largest banks

18:03.125 --> 18:05.780
reported data breaches
on their cloud servers.

18:05.823 --> 18:08.043
And the London
and Frankfurt stock exchanges

18:08.087 --> 18:11.307
just suspended trading
after their own breaches.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.309
We confirm Iran was behind it?

18:13.353 --> 18:15.006
WARE:
We know they are.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.965
They have hacking mills now.
People on the job 24/7.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.315
HILL:
And Tehran's aggression
isn't limited

18:19.359 --> 18:21.187
to financial markets.

18:21.230 --> 18:24.233
A French-flagged
oil tanker

18:24.277 --> 18:26.931
in the Strait of Hormuz
nearly capsized

18:26.975 --> 18:28.498
after the
automated ballast

18:28.542 --> 18:30.935
control system was
remotely compromised.

18:30.979 --> 18:35.723
And British ships in the region
are reporting problems with GPS.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.203
THOMPSON:
Meaning traffic through
the most important

18:37.246 --> 18:39.553
oil-shipping route
in the world

18:39.596 --> 18:42.077
has come
to a complete standstill.RUSSELL: All of which

18:42.121 --> 18:44.427
is a prelude to an inevitable
spike in oil prices,

18:44.471 --> 18:46.081
which you will be blamed for.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.692
There is nothing subtle
about this, ma'am.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.999
Shiraz is under pressure
by the hard-liners.

18:51.042 --> 18:53.784
He wants to stay in power,
he has to appease them.

18:53.828 --> 18:58.354
So, unless we back off,
this is just the beginning.

18:58.398 --> 19:01.792
Well, I'll personally
reach out to our allies.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.403
Reinforce the coalition.

19:03.446 --> 19:06.232
Our allies aren't going
to spend political capital

19:06.275 --> 19:07.798
on an embattled president.

19:07.842 --> 19:10.323
The undermining of democracy
should concern

19:10.366 --> 19:12.629
all free nations.

19:12.673 --> 19:14.327
Well, our friends
aren't as like-minded.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.285
And we won't be able
to exert enough pressure

19:16.329 --> 19:21.160
on Shiraz independently to force
him to cough up the hackers.

19:21.203 --> 19:24.467
Then we'll go it alone.

19:24.511 --> 19:27.427
Ellen, have JSOC pull up
scenarios for the extraction

19:27.470 --> 19:29.516
of the five Iranian nationals

19:29.559 --> 19:31.518
responsible for the attack
on our elections.

19:31.561 --> 19:34.695
You are talking about
breaching Iranian sovereignty.

19:34.738 --> 19:37.132
Yes.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.264
That is an extreme response.

19:38.307 --> 19:39.874
ELIZABETH:
To an extreme provocation,

19:39.917 --> 19:43.791
which we have tried to address
diplomatically with Tehran.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.489
And through the use
of sanctions.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.882
Those measures have
not only failed,

19:47.925 --> 19:50.319
but Iran has become emboldened.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.713
HILL:
Ma'am, I'm duty bound
to advise you

19:52.756 --> 19:54.541
that this could be
seen as an act of war.

19:54.584 --> 19:57.500
WARE:
One which puts U.S. citizens
and service members

19:57.544 --> 20:00.460
overseas in the line of fire.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.505
Not to mention our allies.

20:04.333 --> 20:08.946
Does anyone here doubt that
interfering with our elections

20:08.990 --> 20:11.384
was an act of war?

20:14.735 --> 20:16.911
What we do here--

20:16.954 --> 20:21.568
or don't do--
will have consequences.

20:21.611 --> 20:24.614
Because America is the
bellwether for freedom.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.399
If we look away,

20:26.442 --> 20:29.750
then democracies everywhere
are at risk.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.497
I expect a full range of options
as soon as you gather them.

20:45.113 --> 20:48.203
I'm not saying
"Congressman Codeine."

20:48.247 --> 20:49.987
Why? He's out of rehab.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.686
Fine. Senator Lithium?

20:52.729 --> 20:54.296
[sighs]:
Oh, for God...

20:54.340 --> 20:56.167
I...Hey, Russell.

20:56.211 --> 21:01.216
Welcome to the laugh-free zone,
starring your headliner Mike B.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.783
Yeah, the gang at Cactus Norm's

21:02.826 --> 21:04.219
open mic night
would beg to differ.Uh-huh.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.352
By the way, two-for-one
margaritas on Sundays,

21:06.395 --> 21:08.005
but, uh, skip the tuna nachos.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.485
I think you're gonna find

21:09.529 --> 21:11.574
this update
aggressively unfunny, too.

21:11.618 --> 21:14.838
I back-channeled
with Hanson's chief of staff.

21:14.882 --> 21:17.885
He named his price for shutting
down the investigation.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.756
One kidney or two?

21:19.800 --> 21:21.802
Oh, the whole body,
I'm afraid.

21:21.845 --> 21:24.587
He's demanding rollbacks
on the ESI bill,

21:24.631 --> 21:27.460
approval rights
on all judicial nominees.

21:27.503 --> 21:29.766
Well, that's sort of funny.Yeah, well,

21:29.810 --> 21:32.378
I won't even mention the raft
of anti-environment initiatives,

21:32.421 --> 21:35.555
corporate tax cuts,
weakening

21:35.598 --> 21:38.122
gun control and
health care legislation,

21:38.166 --> 21:41.909
all of which he is
expecting you to cosign.

21:41.952 --> 21:44.651
If I don't?

21:44.694 --> 21:46.174
Well, then he
and his allies

21:46.217 --> 21:49.830
will beat the impeachment drum
for the rest of your term.

21:49.873 --> 21:52.267
I agree to his demands, I'll be
functionally impeached anyway.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.486
It's still worth considering.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.488
On what basis?Political winds

21:55.531 --> 21:58.882
can shift, leverage can change.

21:58.926 --> 22:01.624
Deals can be unmade.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.191
I have no interest
in this office

22:03.234 --> 22:05.672
if I can't do what the people
put me here for.

22:05.715 --> 22:09.371
I'd rather be on the farm
in Virginia writing my memoirs.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.633
With all due
respect, ma'am,

22:10.677 --> 22:12.418
that might be sooner
than you think.

22:15.464 --> 22:18.641
I'll find time to speak
with Senator Hanson

22:18.685 --> 22:21.165
at the Correspondents' Dinner.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.516
Maybe we'll find
some common ground.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.431
I'll pass the word.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.258
BLAKE [clears throat]:
Excuse me, ma'am.

22:27.302 --> 22:28.390
Uh, Jason is in
the Residence.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.436
Would you like me
to invite him down?

22:33.526 --> 22:35.136
No.

22:35.179 --> 22:37.530
Ask Henry
to meet me there.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.183
Yes, ma'am.

22:39.227 --> 22:41.664
First off, every word I said
was taken out of context.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.144
Oh, a hit job, huh?

22:43.187 --> 22:45.625
Yeah, totally. And...

22:45.668 --> 22:47.627
Well, we happen to have
the piece right here,

22:47.670 --> 22:50.456
so we can go over
the inaccuracies.

22:50.499 --> 22:54.024
Okay, maybe I was
a tiny bit clumsy.

22:54.068 --> 22:57.332
Breaking a vase
is clumsy, Jason.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.204
Accusing a female writer
of misogyny

23:00.248 --> 23:01.684
while flagging the fact
that your detail

23:01.728 --> 23:04.208
is packing heat--
that's just dumb.

23:04.252 --> 23:06.428
I was defending you.

23:06.472 --> 23:09.388
I know it came
from a good place,

23:09.431 --> 23:13.087
but you don't help me by
throwing your weight around.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.089
And when you talk
to journalists,

23:15.132 --> 23:17.221
your words are going
to be scrutinized.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.093
Real journalists

23:19.136 --> 23:21.095
don't tote around
Hello Kitty knapsacks.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.836
No, no, the blog's
a farce, okay?

23:22.879 --> 23:24.054
I'm the victim here.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.492
Oh, boy.See, that's just not the way

23:26.535 --> 23:28.407
you want to play this, sport.No, everyone attacks you.

23:29.886 --> 23:30.844
And you just turn
the other cheek.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.454
Don't you get sick of that?

23:32.498 --> 23:35.544
I don't have
that luxury,

23:35.588 --> 23:37.546
and neither
does my family.

23:37.590 --> 23:40.549
And I'm sorry, but
that's the way it is.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.900
Okay. I...

23:46.250 --> 23:47.904
Lesson learned.
Are we done here?

23:47.948 --> 23:50.994
We are, but you're not.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.561
A full-throated
apology

23:52.605 --> 23:54.520
posted online before
the Correspondents' Dinner,

23:54.563 --> 23:57.566
uh, by, let's say, noon.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.655
Tomorrow.

23:59.699 --> 24:02.484
Okay. Yeah. I can,
I'll mock up a clarification.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.094
ELIZABETH AND HENRY: Apology.Okay, fine.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.356
DMITRI:
Isn't this nice?

24:05.400 --> 24:08.316
Mm-hmm.Beautiful evening.

24:08.359 --> 24:10.492
You, me.Mm-hmm.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.844
Four people licensed to kill.

24:14.888 --> 24:18.674
Well, a table for six
is my new normal.

24:18.718 --> 24:21.938
I've never had a normal,
except for you.

24:21.982 --> 24:23.810
Aw.WOMAN: Oh, it's the
president's daughter.

24:23.853 --> 24:27.596
Oh, okay. Uh, here,
let's sit down.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.338
[clears throat]

24:32.775 --> 24:35.343
You're nervous.

24:35.386 --> 24:36.692
[clears throat]

24:36.736 --> 24:39.521
Yeah.
About being seen
with me?

24:39.565 --> 24:40.914
No.

24:40.957 --> 24:44.004
Um, it's just that,

24:44.047 --> 24:45.788
if we're a couple,

24:45.832 --> 24:49.575
then we are official,
and if we're official,

24:49.618 --> 24:52.969
don't know,
my mind goes places.

24:53.013 --> 24:54.623
I'll never
hurt you again.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.799
You can't promise that.

24:56.843 --> 24:59.585
I'll never hurt you
intentionally.
[laughs] Gee.

24:59.628 --> 25:02.457
You really know how
to sweet-talk a gal.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.502
[both laugh]

25:03.545 --> 25:04.590
Look, it's the
best I can do.

25:04.633 --> 25:08.028
Some things
are out of our control.

25:08.071 --> 25:09.464
Yeah.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.466
I just can't do this again.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.773
Like, go all in,
and then

25:13.816 --> 25:17.167
maybe one day I'll-I'll wake up
and you'll be gone

25:17.211 --> 25:20.823
because you have this secret
life that you can't outrun.

25:20.867 --> 25:23.696
Look, there's no more secrets
and there's no more running.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.568
All I can promise
you is this:

25:26.612 --> 25:28.657
I'm not leaving again,

25:28.701 --> 25:33.009
not unless I'm dragged away,
kicking and screaming.

25:33.053 --> 25:36.491
So we leave the rest
up to fate?

25:36.535 --> 25:37.666
No.

25:37.710 --> 25:41.627
I don't trust fate.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.672
I trust you.

25:45.805 --> 25:48.155
Okay.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.765
HENRY:
So how go the jokes?

25:49.809 --> 25:53.726
Six comedy writers,
three speechwriters,

25:53.769 --> 25:56.119
endless edits by Mike B.,

25:56.163 --> 25:57.643
and it still needs
a punch-up.

25:57.686 --> 25:59.514
You're gonna be great.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.517
What I need is a time machine,
so I can

26:02.561 --> 26:04.171
go back
and fix things.

26:04.214 --> 26:06.739
These investigations
aren't going anywhere.

26:06.782 --> 26:07.696
Nope.

26:07.740 --> 26:10.046
Maybe my presidency is.

26:10.090 --> 26:13.006
Babe, don't.I'm just being realistic.

26:15.965 --> 26:20.274
Been thinking a lot
about the fate of pioneers.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.841
Well, you're certainly
one of them.

26:21.884 --> 26:24.626
Yeah. You know what pioneers
get to accomplish?

26:24.670 --> 26:27.673
Being first. That's it.

26:27.716 --> 26:28.630
Some accomplished
more than that.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.066
Not the ones
that matter.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.808
Susan B. Anthony paved the way
for women's suffrage

26:32.852 --> 26:35.681
but died 15 years
before women got to vote.

26:35.724 --> 26:38.509
And Martin Luther King
fought for equality

26:38.553 --> 26:42.383
but didn't live to see
many of his dreams fulfilled.

26:42.426 --> 26:45.038
People who provide the spark

26:45.081 --> 26:47.257
don't often get
to sit by the fire.

26:47.301 --> 26:49.303
Maybe

26:49.346 --> 26:52.175
the country just wasn't ready

26:52.219 --> 26:54.221
for the first female president.

26:56.266 --> 27:01.010
Or maybe all this is just
inevitable tectonic shifts.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.317
The earth
realigning itself.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.059
Or opening up
to swallow me whole.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.104
You're gonna get through this.

27:10.977 --> 27:13.109
What if I don't?

27:13.153 --> 27:15.329
Well, then you'll have
a burgeoning comedy career

27:15.372 --> 27:17.766
to fall back on.

27:17.810 --> 27:20.813
Maybe I'll just
fall back on you.

27:20.856 --> 27:23.859
Well, that works, too.[chuckles]

27:26.296 --> 27:28.908
WARE:
Iran's cyber force

27:28.951 --> 27:31.388
is a decentralized
confederation of hackers,

27:31.432 --> 27:33.652
but our intel
confirms

27:33.695 --> 27:36.698
there's nothing random about the
dispersion of our five targets.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.352
Tabriz, Mashhad,

27:38.395 --> 27:41.355
Zahedan,
and Bushehr.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.749
The four corners
of the country.And Reza Mousavi,

27:43.792 --> 27:45.707
the crown jewel,

27:45.751 --> 27:47.796
is in Tehran.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.015
Our range of options,
unfortunately,

27:49.058 --> 27:50.886
has boiled down to one.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.845
We would have to have
a full-scale invasion

27:52.888 --> 27:54.368
to extract all the targets.

27:54.411 --> 27:58.024
Which sets the stage for a long
and costly occupation.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.678
ELIZABETH:
Another Iraq.Yes, ma'am.

28:01.854 --> 28:05.727
Well, if we can't get into Iran,

28:05.771 --> 28:08.251
maybe we can get
the targets out,

28:08.295 --> 28:09.862
at least Mousavi.

28:09.905 --> 28:12.081
Ma'am?Well, do we have any

28:12.125 --> 28:15.519
high-ranking assets left
in Hezbollah?We do.

28:15.563 --> 28:19.480
Someone who could draw Mousavi
out so he's a soft target?

28:19.523 --> 28:23.484
Our agent would have to dangle
the promise of a package

28:23.527 --> 28:26.748
so sensitive, it could
only be passed in person.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.708
And we'd have to burn him.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.361
But it can be done.

28:31.405 --> 28:33.363
Theoretically.

28:33.407 --> 28:34.713
But what about the
other four suspects?

28:34.756 --> 28:37.367
Well, I'm willing
to trade

28:37.411 --> 28:39.326
the head of the snake
for the rest of its body.

28:39.369 --> 28:43.634
HUMINT says Mousavi's in line
for a big promotion,

28:43.678 --> 28:46.115
maybe as soon
as tomorrow.

28:46.159 --> 28:47.987
Shiraz keeps his inner circle
a stone's throw away,

28:48.030 --> 28:50.772
under heavy guard.It'll be a high-risk op.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.339
Well, then there's
no time to waste.

28:52.382 --> 28:53.862
WARE:
And if it fails,

28:53.906 --> 28:55.821
there will be
American fatalities.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.170
And fallout.

28:57.213 --> 28:59.433
Just ask Carter
the cost

28:59.476 --> 29:00.956
of botched Iranian missions.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.784
And even if this goes off
without a hitch,

29:02.828 --> 29:06.962
your political enemies will
accuse you of wagging the dog.

29:07.006 --> 29:08.181
Even if you win,

29:08.224 --> 29:11.619
you'll lose.Yeah.

29:11.662 --> 29:14.883
Yup. I want Mousavi on
American soil to face justice.

29:14.927 --> 29:15.971
I'll deal
with the rest later.

29:16.015 --> 29:17.886
Set it up.Yes, Madam President.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.242
Hey, Russell, Mousavi
is happily ensconced

29:26.286 --> 29:30.812
at a baccarat table
at the Casino de la Falaise.

29:30.856 --> 29:35.208
It's some luxury seaside resort
just south of Beirut.

29:35.251 --> 29:38.777
There's a joint HRT/SEAL Team
task force ready to grab him up.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.909
Okay. Bye.

29:40.953 --> 29:42.781
So, what's the pretext?

29:42.824 --> 29:44.739
A stolen workup
on the vulnerabilities

29:44.783 --> 29:46.393
of our
electrical grids.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.395
Have you read in
President Bashar?
No.

29:48.438 --> 29:51.354
His loyalties
are divided.

29:51.398 --> 29:53.879
Besides, it's easier to ask
forgiveness than permission.

29:53.922 --> 29:56.795
Speaking of forgiveness,
Madam President, Dr. McCord,

29:56.838 --> 29:59.101
Jason posted,

29:59.145 --> 30:01.016
uh, an apology
on social media.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.844
Do we want to see it?

30:02.888 --> 30:04.019
Uh, in ten years.

30:04.063 --> 30:05.804
[groans]

30:06.892 --> 30:10.547
JASON [over video]:
Um, some of you

30:10.591 --> 30:13.855
may have seen a piece on me
in The Cambridge Rubric

30:13.899 --> 30:16.466
discussing my interaction
with a college journalist,

30:16.510 --> 30:17.859
and I would like

30:17.903 --> 30:19.208
to address the matter.

30:19.252 --> 30:21.820
Um, I'm sorry for what happened.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.822
An auspicious
enough start.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.040
I'm sorry I disrespected

30:25.084 --> 30:28.914
the serious field
of college journalism.

30:28.957 --> 30:32.004
And I'm sorry I failed
to recognize that the press

30:32.047 --> 30:34.789
should be free to vilify
our leaders without consequence.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.444
Oh, less auspicious.

30:37.487 --> 30:38.967
And I was wrong
to defend my mother

30:39.011 --> 30:40.664
because she has been
treated so fairly

30:40.708 --> 30:42.362
by journalists

30:42.405 --> 30:44.799
and by the Senate
Intelligence Committee

30:44.843 --> 30:46.366
and by conservative critics
who have

30:46.409 --> 30:49.021
embraced her as the
female president that they've

30:49.064 --> 30:51.893
always been longing for.No, no, no...

30:51.937 --> 30:54.504
And I hope one day to display
the ethics and decorum

30:54.548 --> 30:58.291
so regularly evidenced
by our woke media

30:58.334 --> 31:01.903
'cause it's what they deserve.
Jason out.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.513
Yeah.

31:03.557 --> 31:06.908
Well, it was, technically,
an apology.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.649
So how do you want
to handle it?

31:08.692 --> 31:09.955
I don't.

31:10.999 --> 31:13.654
You're both gonna
get hammered.

31:13.697 --> 31:15.177
Well, I'm used to it.

31:15.221 --> 31:18.267
Maybe he'll learn something
about consequences

31:18.311 --> 31:21.967
and how to talk to people.Speaking of which,

31:22.010 --> 31:23.838
have you decided what
you're gonna say to Hanson?

31:23.882 --> 31:25.840
Yeah. Am I sure

31:25.884 --> 31:28.060
it's the right thing to do?

31:28.103 --> 31:32.064
Well, that's
a whole different animal.

31:32.107 --> 31:34.805
MIKE:
Why do they call these
stupid things monkey suits?

31:34.849 --> 31:37.460
No self-respecting simian would
be caught dead in one of them.

31:37.504 --> 31:38.984
I thought
you liked galas.

31:39.027 --> 31:40.637
Only when I'm trolling
for business.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.988
This place is like a casting
call for The Walking Dead.

31:43.031 --> 31:44.511
Where's the president?

31:44.554 --> 31:48.167
Uh, discussing free trade
with, uh, Secretary Barnum.

31:48.210 --> 31:51.648
Tell her the senator's ready.Will do.

31:53.346 --> 31:54.913
ELIZABETH:
Cynthia.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.392
PAUL: Great to see you.ELIZABETH: Hey, Paul.

31:56.436 --> 31:57.654
HENRY: Cynthia, how are you?CYNTHIA: Henry.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.482
Oh, so good to see you.HENRY: Hey, Paul.

31:59.526 --> 32:02.398
And my dress is biodegradable,
in honor of your ESI bill.Oh, come on.

32:02.442 --> 32:04.966
That's fantastic. You know
what else is biodegradable?

32:05.010 --> 32:08.230
French fries, truffles,
mac and cheese.

32:08.274 --> 32:09.971
I'm actually just eating

32:10.015 --> 32:11.625
for the environment
tonight.

32:11.668 --> 32:14.149
Really good to see you both.Good to see you.
Take care.

32:14.193 --> 32:16.978
Hey, guys. Hi.Hi. Mom, Dad.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.327
Oh. Sorry.Uh, this is Shasta.

32:18.371 --> 32:20.547
Yeah, hi, Shasta.It is an honor to meet you,

32:20.590 --> 32:21.896
Mr. and Mrs. President.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.985
Yeah, that's not--
that's not how that...

32:24.029 --> 32:25.944
My-my mom...This is huge. I...

32:25.987 --> 32:28.642
Just go and have fun.
Just don't worry.

32:28.685 --> 32:29.773
We'll see you
at the table.

32:29.817 --> 32:30.992
Hi. Uh,
Madam President?Yes?

32:31.036 --> 32:33.342
Uh, Senator Hanson
is ready for you.

32:36.084 --> 32:37.999
Good luck.

32:51.621 --> 32:55.103
Madam President.Senator.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.062
I hope you're enjoying
your evening.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.803
Well, so far,
so good.

33:01.153 --> 33:03.111
Have you considered
my offer?

33:03.155 --> 33:06.027
I have.
At some length.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.986
Before I respond to it,

33:08.029 --> 33:12.077
I-I do want
to acknowledge something.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.774
I have made mistakes.

33:13.817 --> 33:16.124
I can be too single-minded

33:16.168 --> 33:18.866
in my pursuit of progress.

33:18.909 --> 33:22.130
Not solicitous enough
of opposing viewpoints.

33:22.174 --> 33:23.566
And the charge

33:23.610 --> 33:26.961
that I haven't always been
quick to compromise--

33:27.005 --> 33:29.485
well, that hits
the mark, too.

33:29.529 --> 33:30.791
Well said.

33:30.834 --> 33:34.012
Compromise is the key
to effective leadership.

33:34.055 --> 33:38.929
It is.
But here's the thing, Senator.

33:38.973 --> 33:42.150
You don't want
compromise.

33:42.194 --> 33:45.632
You want my complete
and unconditional surrender

33:45.675 --> 33:48.504
to your demands.That's a bit
over the top,

33:48.548 --> 33:51.116
don't you think?No.

33:51.159 --> 33:56.034
What's over the top is months
of hearings engineered only

33:56.077 --> 33:58.210
to further
your boundless ambition.

33:58.253 --> 34:03.084
The relentless persecution
of my staff, the most devoted

34:03.128 --> 34:06.479
and selfless public servants
I have ever had the privilege

34:06.522 --> 34:08.872
of serving with.

34:08.916 --> 34:10.657
You're a cheap
shakedown artist, Senator.

34:10.700 --> 34:14.052
And I am not willing
to sell out my agenda

34:14.095 --> 34:16.184
to sit in the Oval
and take orders

34:16.228 --> 34:19.796
from a partisan hack,
who puts his own self-interest

34:19.840 --> 34:21.276
before
the national good.

34:21.320 --> 34:25.585
I'm gonna continue serving
the American people.

34:25.628 --> 34:28.979
You're just gonna have
to try and stop me.

34:29.023 --> 34:32.200
When the end comes,
and it will, soon,

34:32.244 --> 34:34.942
remember I gave you
a chance, Elizabeth.

34:35.986 --> 34:39.947
It's Madam President.
You remember that.

34:51.437 --> 34:53.395
Um, this is my
date Shasta.Hi. Nice to meet you.

34:53.439 --> 34:56.137
...drivers here this evening.
Please feel free to drink up.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.879
[cheering]Yep, the administration

34:58.922 --> 35:02.448
has graciously arranged
for free rides home

35:02.491 --> 35:05.059
care of the U.S.
Marshals Service.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.626
[cheers and applause]So buckle up, guys!

35:06.669 --> 35:08.454
Here we go.

35:08.497 --> 35:10.020
[cheering and applause]

35:10.064 --> 35:12.284
Speaking of McCords
who hate the media,

35:12.327 --> 35:14.068
there is the president's son
Jason.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.983
Hello, Jason,
it's great to see you.

35:16.026 --> 35:18.159
Uh, Jason is now

35:18.203 --> 35:19.334
a college junior.

35:19.378 --> 35:21.031
He is majoring in affluenza

35:21.075 --> 35:24.209
and minoring in celibacy.

35:24.252 --> 35:26.167
[laughter]Jason, uh,

35:26.211 --> 35:28.038
does intend to follow
in his mom's footsteps.Extraction team is in place.

35:28.082 --> 35:29.692
It's awaiting your okay.He hopes to enter

35:29.736 --> 35:31.477
the political arena...They have it.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.608
...as the subject

35:32.652 --> 35:35.220
of simultaneous
federal investigations.

35:35.263 --> 35:38.223
No, seriously, don't worry,
Jason, in ten years

35:38.266 --> 35:41.443
no one will remember how you
publicly humiliated yourself.

35:41.487 --> 35:44.446
I, I do think I speak
for everyone here tonight

35:44.490 --> 35:46.753
when I say,
thank God for the Internet.

35:46.796 --> 35:48.102
[laughter]

35:48.146 --> 35:49.712
Can we switch seats?

35:49.756 --> 35:51.105
EMCEE:
Our president

35:51.149 --> 35:54.239
is a woman of conviction.

35:54.282 --> 35:55.675
Or soon will be.

35:55.718 --> 35:57.067
Um...[laughter and groaning]

35:57.111 --> 35:59.069
But she is a good sport,

35:59.113 --> 36:03.073
and now I'm gonna give her
the chance to take a few shots

36:03.117 --> 36:04.771
at all of us.

36:04.814 --> 36:08.253
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

36:08.296 --> 36:11.212
President Elizabeth McCord!

36:17.044 --> 36:18.350
ELIZABETH:
Thank you.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.049
Good evening.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.964
Traditionally,

36:24.007 --> 36:26.532
this is a night for humor,

36:26.575 --> 36:28.098
but some people
in my administration

36:28.142 --> 36:30.449
have informed me
that I am not funny.

36:30.492 --> 36:32.059
[laughter]

36:32.102 --> 36:35.889
I will miss all of them dearly.

36:35.932 --> 36:38.021
[laughter and applause]

36:39.066 --> 36:40.198
Yet while it pains me

36:40.241 --> 36:43.244
to say this,
these people were right.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.855
Truth is, I'm not that funny,

36:45.899 --> 36:48.075
and sometimes the truth hurts

36:48.118 --> 36:50.686
and it isn't what
we want to hear.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.862
[knock on door] But truth is the fabric

36:52.906 --> 36:55.169
that binds society together. [speaking foreign language]

36:55.213 --> 36:57.824
What makes our government work.

36:57.867 --> 37:00.522
What gives people trust
in their leaders.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.176
And no one

37:02.220 --> 37:06.267
is a more important defender
of the truth

37:06.311 --> 37:07.877
than the people in this room.

37:07.921 --> 37:11.229
[cheering and applause]

37:11.272 --> 37:12.447
What you do

37:12.491 --> 37:14.275
is serious,

37:14.319 --> 37:17.757
and it is important
and as critical

37:17.800 --> 37:20.499
to our liberty as the work
of any branch of government.

37:20.542 --> 37:23.153
The people in this room have

37:23.197 --> 37:25.808
the unassailable right
to document,

37:25.852 --> 37:29.290
to editorialize, to
criticize, and to do so

37:29.334 --> 37:31.858
without fear of reprisal.

37:31.901 --> 37:35.035
WOMAN:
Yeah! [applause]

37:35.078 --> 37:38.952
Because without a free press,
truth is not reported,

37:38.995 --> 37:41.389
power is not held accountable,

37:41.433 --> 37:43.913
and democracy cannot survive.

37:43.957 --> 37:46.264
The founders had the wisdom

37:46.307 --> 37:48.527
to understand this
and to enshrine

37:48.570 --> 37:50.920
this understanding
in our holiest

37:50.964 --> 37:52.444
of civic documents.

37:53.445 --> 37:55.708
Congress shall make no law

37:55.751 --> 37:57.753
abridging the freedom
of the press.

37:57.797 --> 38:00.060
[cheering]

38:02.367 --> 38:05.152
So says the First Amendment,

38:05.195 --> 38:06.545
the elemental freedom

38:06.588 --> 38:10.288
without which all other
freedoms are imperiled.

38:10.331 --> 38:12.594
May we all cherish

38:12.638 --> 38:15.205
the freedom
that we honor tonight

38:15.249 --> 38:17.338
and protect it.

38:17.382 --> 38:20.254
Thank you.
You're all under arrest.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.257
[laughter]

38:23.301 --> 38:24.650
[cheering]

38:31.657 --> 38:34.921
HANSON: Fellow members,
it is my solemn duty

38:34.964 --> 38:37.619
to update you on the fruits
of my committee's investigation.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.795
What began
as a targeted inquiry...

38:39.839 --> 38:41.928
He's not wasting any time.

38:41.971 --> 38:44.104
Hanson's addressing
the full Senate.

38:44.147 --> 38:46.759
At least he's finally putting
all of his cards on the table.

38:46.802 --> 38:48.804
Let's see what kind
of hand he has.

38:48.848 --> 38:51.067
...by President McCord's
own FBI.

38:51.111 --> 38:52.460
And while
the shameless obstruction

38:52.504 --> 38:54.157
of President McCord's staff

38:54.201 --> 38:57.247
means my committee's work
is still ongoing,

38:57.291 --> 38:59.424
I can say with confidence
that we have uncovered

38:59.467 --> 39:00.773
a pervasive pattern

39:00.816 --> 39:03.341
of secrecy and corruption
in the White House,

39:03.384 --> 39:05.473
contempt for truth
and transparency

39:05.517 --> 39:07.649
coordinated by President McCord

39:07.693 --> 39:11.392
that should trouble
every American.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.526
The evidence is overwhelming

39:14.569 --> 39:16.092
and irrefutable.

39:16.136 --> 39:17.529
Her former press secretary

39:17.572 --> 39:20.140
Daisy Grant fired
for concealing her receipt

39:20.183 --> 39:21.359
of hacked election materials

39:21.402 --> 39:24.013
from Iranian asset
Claudine Bernard.

39:24.057 --> 39:27.365
Her closest aide Blake Moran
caught in a scheme

39:27.408 --> 39:30.280
he and the president's own
daughter executed to circumvent

39:30.324 --> 39:33.371
campaign finance
disclosure requirements.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.503
Her longtime fixer and bagman
Mike Barnow

39:35.547 --> 39:37.897
implicated in covering up
the suspicious death

39:37.940 --> 39:39.594
of a government official.

39:39.638 --> 39:42.684
In every instance
President McCord's reward

39:42.728 --> 39:45.383
for these acts of malfeasance?

39:45.426 --> 39:49.387
A high-ranking job
in the White House.

39:49.430 --> 39:53.434
It pains me to say this culture
of corruption and self-dealing

39:53.478 --> 39:56.916
extends to the president's
own family.

39:56.959 --> 39:59.397
To her husband,
who has ironically been gifted

39:59.440 --> 40:01.921
the role of ethics czar
in her administration.

40:01.964 --> 40:03.923
To her daughter,
who was brazenly seen

40:03.966 --> 40:06.273
in the company
of former spy Dmitri Petrov

40:06.316 --> 40:07.666
at last night's
Correspondents' Dinner.

40:07.709 --> 40:11.104
Mr. Petrov's presence
was made possible

40:11.147 --> 40:13.759
because the administration
negotiated an amnesty deal

40:13.802 --> 40:15.456
with Russia
that greased his return,

40:15.500 --> 40:16.849
apparently so the president

40:16.892 --> 40:18.894
could facilitate
her daughter's...

40:20.505 --> 40:22.463
...romantic yearnings.

40:22.507 --> 40:25.466
And still there's more.That son of a bitch.

40:25.510 --> 40:26.598
The recent revelations

40:26.641 --> 40:28.382
that then
Secretary of State McCord

40:28.426 --> 40:30.471
assaulted a foreign leader

40:30.515 --> 40:31.951
and concealed it.

40:31.994 --> 40:35.084
That as a rogue agent,
she authorized the torture--

40:35.128 --> 40:38.871
the torture--
of a suspected terrorist.

40:38.914 --> 40:42.614
In the wake of this accumulation
of damning evidence,

40:42.657 --> 40:45.704
how does President McCord
respond?

40:45.747 --> 40:47.749
By trying to distract the public

40:47.793 --> 40:50.535
with a sensational mission

40:50.578 --> 40:53.929
to kidnap a member
of Iran's Revolutionary Guard,

40:53.973 --> 40:55.627
a desperate act of adventurism

40:55.670 --> 40:58.064
to convince us
she is not in league

40:58.107 --> 41:01.328
with the country
that facilitated her election.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.504
Where does this lawlessness end?

41:03.548 --> 41:05.288
[senators murmuring]

41:05.332 --> 41:07.856
With accountability.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.163
Which is why I have referred
the work product

41:10.206 --> 41:12.426
of this investigation
to Representative Canning

41:12.470 --> 41:15.516
of the House Judiciary Committee

41:15.560 --> 41:19.041
for proceedings consistent
with their charter.

41:19.085 --> 41:21.566
"Consistent with their charter."
Oh, my God.

41:21.609 --> 41:23.176
Impeachment.It's beginning.

41:23.219 --> 41:25.395
All right, here we go.

41:25.439 --> 41:27.093
We need to war game this.

41:27.136 --> 41:29.182
Let's, uh, let's grab Olivia.

41:29.225 --> 41:31.619
Hunker down with our allies.
Start deploying them.

41:31.663 --> 41:34.535
A media onslaught.
Print, broadcast, digital.

41:34.579 --> 41:36.537
Guys.

41:36.581 --> 41:39.018
Do you think you could give me
a minute, please?

41:40.062 --> 41:42.412
Madam President.

41:42.456 --> 41:44.458
Yes, ma'am.

42:03.172 --> 42:04.522
Blake?

42:06.524 --> 42:08.482
When is my meeting

42:08.526 --> 42:10.353
with the Council
of Economic Advisers?

42:10.397 --> 42:11.529
10:30.Move it up.

42:11.572 --> 42:13.139
I also need

42:13.182 --> 42:15.707
the OMB report
on carbon reductions

42:15.750 --> 42:17.273
and the latest slate

42:17.317 --> 42:19.580
on potential judicial nominees,
all right?

42:19.624 --> 42:22.104
Right away.It's not your fault.

42:24.150 --> 42:25.673
Ma'am?

42:25.717 --> 42:29.459
The flash drive.
The oppo file.

42:29.503 --> 42:32.593
You were with me here
at the very beginning.

42:32.637 --> 42:35.204
You'll be here at the end.

42:35.248 --> 42:37.206
Whenever that day is.

42:39.252 --> 42:40.601
Yes, ma'am.

42:41.646 --> 42:43.430
Let's get to work.
