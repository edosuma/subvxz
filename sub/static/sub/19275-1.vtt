WEBVTT

00:05.689 --> 00:07.423
Go away.

00:07.459 --> 00:09.058
I'm killing myself.

00:09.094 --> 00:10.393

00:46.865 --> 00:48.698
So tell me, my sweet...

00:48.733 --> 00:50.099
Mm-hmm?

00:50.135 --> 00:52.435
My 28th day anniversary present?

00:52.470 --> 00:53.669
Mm-hmm?

00:53.705 --> 00:56.806
It symbolizes what, exactly?

00:56.841 --> 00:59.642
Well, um, in the Kabbalah,

00:59.677 --> 01:03.579
the number 28 is the
symbol of the wanderer,

01:03.615 --> 01:07.550
who, after many years
in the dating desert,

01:07.585 --> 01:10.520
finally stops his wandering.

01:10.555 --> 01:12.522
And so we give a gift
associated with the foot...

01:12.557 --> 01:14.624
Finally at rest.

01:14.659 --> 01:17.360
Oh, you're so full of the bullshit.

01:17.395 --> 01:20.563
Oh, my God,
what am I going to do with you?

01:20.598 --> 01:22.765
Exactly what you've been doing

01:22.801 --> 01:24.934
until death do us part.

01:27.405 --> 01:29.238
I love it.

01:29.274 --> 01:30.573
Diamond.

01:30.608 --> 01:32.341
I just remembered I
have another surprise.

01:32.377 --> 01:34.110
It arrived at the office today.

01:34.145 --> 01:36.012
Aw.

01:36.047 --> 01:37.246
Okay.

01:37.282 --> 01:39.916
<i>There you go. Okay.</i>

01:39.951 --> 01:43.252
<i>May Adonai bless your lives together,</i>

01:43.288 --> 01:44.921
<i>your yichud.</i>

01:44.956 --> 01:46.322
<i>And by the power invested in me</i>

01:46.357 --> 01:47.723
<i>by the State of Indiana...</i>

01:47.759 --> 01:49.292
We look happy.

01:49.327 --> 01:51.360
<i>I now pronounce you husband and wife...</i>

01:51.396 --> 01:52.995
You looked so beautiful.

01:53.031 --> 01:54.997
- <i>Till death do you part.</i>
- Thank you.

01:55.033 --> 01:56.599
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

02:00.872 --> 02:02.772
Wow, you make me look
like a good dancer.

02:02.807 --> 02:03.873
No, you are a good dancer.

02:03.908 --> 02:04.907
Yeah, come on.

02:04.943 --> 02:06.843
Wow. Oh, no.

02:09.347 --> 02:10.713
Oh, my God!

02:10.747 --> 02:12.415
I can't believe how drink

02:12.450 --> 02:13.683
your brother was.

02:13.718 --> 02:14.650
Drunk. Not drink.

02:14.686 --> 02:15.852
Oh, my God.

02:15.887 --> 02:17.186
- And your father...
- Yeah.

02:17.222 --> 02:18.454
Looks jealous, huh?

02:18.489 --> 02:19.548
Busted.

02:21.826 --> 02:24.594
Mr. Ellis has skills.

02:24.629 --> 02:26.829
Oh, my God,
I got your Aunt Katherine to smile.

02:26.865 --> 02:28.557
Oh, you made her laugh.

02:30.068 --> 02:32.301
Ah, Mr. Ellis is checking her out.

02:32.337 --> 02:34.971
Hey, you know what?
We should set those two up.

02:35.006 --> 02:36.539
What? I'm serious.

02:36.574 --> 02:38.174
Okay.

02:40.044 --> 02:41.944
What are you doing? I can't see.

02:41.980 --> 02:43.446
You don't need to see.

03:17.315 --> 03:18.714
Hey, what's the matter?

03:18.750 --> 03:20.149
It happened so quick.

03:20.184 --> 03:21.450
- He was...
- It's Mr. Ellis.

03:21.486 --> 03:23.719
Oh! Oh!

03:23.755 --> 03:26.956
<i>Unit Zero, we've got a 10-87
en route with package.</i>

03:26.991 --> 03:27.990
<i>Be there in 15.</i>

03:28.768 --> 03:30.393
Shit, man, you're way late.
Did you talk to Dad?

03:30.428 --> 03:32.028
- What happened to Mr. Ellis?
- He collapsed in the kitchen.

03:32.063 --> 03:34.263
- Almond milk everywhere.
- Jesus, is he gonna make it?

03:34.299 --> 03:35.498
Touch and go.

03:35.533 --> 03:36.766
Hey, we get old. We die.

03:36.801 --> 03:37.833
Listen, I asked Gaby to grab

03:37.869 --> 03:39.335
the accounting department roster.

03:39.370 --> 03:40.836
Come on; I don't have much time.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.471
If Mr. Ellis croaks,
I'd rather hire within

03:42.507 --> 03:43.973
than pay some headhunter.

03:44.008 --> 03:46.609
Do not give me
your sensitive face, Ezra.

03:46.644 --> 03:48.044
Come on. You're running HR now.

03:48.079 --> 03:49.145
Deal with it, huh?

03:49.180 --> 03:50.846
Gaby, get over here!

03:50.882 --> 03:54.016
So tell me,
what's today's anniversary gift?

03:54.052 --> 03:55.785
Scented candles? Fondue set?

03:55.820 --> 03:57.420
His-and-her vibrators, buddy?

03:57.455 --> 03:58.754
- Hey.
- All right, kiddies.

03:58.790 --> 04:00.623
I'm outie.
Pebble Beach is calling my name.

04:00.658 --> 04:02.558
Ezra, text me on Mr. Ellis.

04:02.593 --> 04:04.427
Gaby, do not seduce my brother.

04:04.462 --> 04:07.463
He's married and already
punching way above his weight.

04:07.498 --> 04:09.665
Okay, bye.

04:09.701 --> 04:12.034
Poor Mr. Ellis. He's such a nice guy.

04:12.070 --> 04:13.436
I know. He's a total charmer.

04:13.471 --> 04:15.104
Do you know if he's
married or has kids or...

04:15.139 --> 04:17.406
- I don't know.
- Wow.

04:17.442 --> 04:19.274
So how did the anklet go over?

04:19.310 --> 04:20.343
Wouldn't you like to know?

04:20.378 --> 04:21.507
Oh, wow.

04:22.046 --> 04:23.312
Okay, I guess it went well, then.

04:23.348 --> 04:25.381
Um, well,
the ownership paperwork came through,

04:25.416 --> 04:28.584
so you're all set for present number 29.

04:28.619 --> 04:30.319
Just come by my desk
whenever you want them.

04:30.355 --> 04:31.787
Perfect. Thanks, Gaby.

04:31.823 --> 04:33.389
You know I'd be lost without you.

04:33.424 --> 04:35.257
- You're welcome.
- <i>Ezra!</i>

04:35.293 --> 04:38.694
<i>Stop flirting, and get
your skinny ass in my office now.</i>

04:38.730 --> 04:41.063
<i>Arthur, could you turn off
your intercom, please,</i>

04:41.099 --> 04:43.132
<i>and talk like a human?</i>

04:43.167 --> 04:44.867
<i>We've had enough drama
around here for one morning.</i>

04:44.902 --> 04:46.302
Good morning, Mom.

04:46.337 --> 04:48.170
<i>Good morning, beautiful boy.</i>

04:51.957 --> 04:53.976
- _
- Oh, no.

04:54.012 --> 04:57.947
63 years old, drops dead making a latte.

04:57.982 --> 04:59.849
Shit!

04:59.884 --> 05:02.918
When I go, I hope it's laying
on top of your mother.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.054
- Jesus, Dad.
- <i>Jesus, Arthur.</i>

05:05.089 --> 05:07.890
Whatever. I'm not going out
making a fricking latte.

05:07.925 --> 05:09.658
I'm sure you'll have a
very masculine death.

05:09.694 --> 05:10.826
Don't you patronize me.

05:10.862 --> 05:12.895
I can still kick your ass.

05:12.930 --> 05:14.196
You want to wrestle?

05:14.232 --> 05:16.098
Not particularly.

05:17.201 --> 05:18.768
Did you hire a new head of accounting?

05:18.803 --> 05:20.770
I found out he died two minutes ago.

05:20.805 --> 05:23.773
That's why I had Josh tell
you to have it lined up.

05:23.808 --> 05:25.174
It's called thinking ahead.

05:25.209 --> 05:27.143
I'll take care of it.

05:29.947 --> 05:33.983
You and Ava seem pretty happy.

05:34.018 --> 05:35.584
Don't screw it up.

05:35.620 --> 05:37.820
Doing my best.

05:37.855 --> 05:39.955
Hope your wife likes surprises.

05:39.991 --> 05:42.892
My mom's boyfriend got her a
ferret for her last birthday.

05:42.927 --> 05:44.727
That was a shitshow, man.

05:44.762 --> 05:46.162
Ava's gonna love this girl.

05:46.197 --> 05:48.931
Ah, it says your card's no good.

05:48.966 --> 05:49.932
Really?

05:49.967 --> 05:50.966
"Declined."

05:51.002 --> 05:52.101
Okay.

05:52.136 --> 05:53.736
Here. Try this one.

05:54.906 --> 05:56.705
Here you go.

05:58.709 --> 06:01.177
Yeah, it says this one's no good either.

06:01.212 --> 06:02.778
I... that's not possible.

06:02.814 --> 06:04.246
Come back tomorrow, I guess?

06:04.282 --> 06:05.614
No, we... we have to make this work.

06:05.650 --> 06:07.216
- I'm...
- I'm closing in ten minutes.

06:07.251 --> 06:09.785
It's our 29th day wedding anniversary.

06:09.821 --> 06:11.720
I don't think that's a thing, man.

06:11.756 --> 06:13.155
<i>I didn't take</i>

06:13.191 --> 06:16.225
$30,000 of cash out
on my credit card, okay?

06:16.260 --> 06:18.427
I mean, if I had, I wouldn't need
to use my card right now.

06:18.463 --> 06:19.795
Hey, I'm closing in five.

06:19.831 --> 06:21.130
You know what? Never mind.

06:23.267 --> 06:25.101
Uh, is there an ATM around here?

06:25.136 --> 06:27.503
End of the block,
next to the Fashion Gal.

06:27.538 --> 06:29.071
Could you just hold on for five minutes?

06:29.107 --> 06:30.072
I'll be... I'll be right back.

06:30.108 --> 06:32.141
- I guess.
- Thanks.

06:32.176 --> 06:33.876
Be back for you in a minute, all right?

06:35.012 --> 06:36.245
God!

06:42.788 --> 06:44.488
_

06:44.789 --> 06:46.355
What the fu...

06:48.759 --> 06:50.326
Call Ava.

06:52.930 --> 06:55.030
<i>We're sorry; you have reached a number</i>

06:55.066 --> 06:57.900
<i>that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.</i>

06:59.704 --> 07:01.770
Slow down!

07:08.646 --> 07:09.745
Ava?

07:10.748 --> 07:12.715
Ava, honey?

07:14.652 --> 07:16.685
<i>Ava.</i>

07:34.772 --> 07:37.339
<i>911. Please state the
nature of your emergency.</i>

07:37.375 --> 07:38.707
Yeah, I... I think we've been robbed.

07:38.743 --> 07:41.010
My wife's car is here, but she's...

07:41.045 --> 07:44.079
I'm worried she's been kidnapped or...

07:44.115 --> 07:45.548
<i>Are you in danger?</i>

07:45.583 --> 07:47.616
<i>Are you safe?</i>

07:47.652 --> 07:48.751
<i>Hello? Sir?</i>

08:03.452 --> 08:05.586
<i>Hi, Ez.</i>

08:05.622 --> 08:08.489
<i>You must be very confused.</i>

08:08.525 --> 08:12.593
<i>The credit cards, the checking account,</i>

08:12.629 --> 08:13.828
<i>the cash.</i>

08:13.863 --> 08:15.229
<i>It's a shock.</i>

08:15.265 --> 08:17.798
<i>There is no easy way to say it,</i>

08:17.834 --> 08:19.600
<i>but here it is.</i>

08:19.636 --> 08:22.803
<i>You will never see me again.</i>

08:22.839 --> 08:24.138
<i>The sooner you accept it,</i>

08:24.174 --> 08:26.407
<i>the better it is for everyone.</i>

08:26.442 --> 08:29.377
<i>Ezra, you will ask yourself
many questions</i>

08:29.412 --> 08:31.179
<i>in the days ahead.</i>

08:31.214 --> 08:34.682
<i>You will replay every
moment we shared together,</i>

08:34.717 --> 08:38.452
<i>think about every person
we met along the way.</i>

08:38.488 --> 08:40.520
<i>You will begin to doubt</i>

08:40.557 --> 08:44.458
<i>everyone and everything you know.</i>

08:44.494 --> 08:47.628
<i>You will even begin to doubt yourself.</i>

08:47.664 --> 08:50.364
<i>It's only normal.</i>

08:50.400 --> 08:53.768
<i>What will you tell your
friends and family?</i>

08:53.803 --> 08:56.370
<i>All anyone needs to know is this:</i>

08:56.406 --> 08:59.540
<i>we rushed into marriage
hardly knowing each other.</i>

08:59.576 --> 09:01.275
No.

09:01.311 --> 09:03.644
<i>Cultural differences, language barriers.</i>

09:03.680 --> 09:06.714
<i>And people will accept this.</i>

09:06.749 --> 09:11.419
<i>But you will still want to find me,</i>

09:11.454 --> 09:13.454
<i>to punish me.</i>

09:13.489 --> 09:16.490
<i>Ezra, I want you to stand up now</i>

09:16.526 --> 09:18.859
<i>and go and open the freezer door.</i>

09:18.895 --> 09:22.630
<i>Now, listen to me very carefully.</i>

09:22.665 --> 09:26.067
<i>If you ever go to the
police and try to find me,</i>

09:27.837 --> 09:30.037
<i>one, you will fail.</i>

09:30.073 --> 09:33.107
<i>You will never find me.</i>

09:33.142 --> 09:38.045
<i>Two, everyone in your family,
everyone in the world</i>

09:38.081 --> 09:41.415
<i>will know what's inside that folder.</i>

09:41.451 --> 09:43.851
<i>Don't put yourself through that.</i>

09:43.886 --> 09:46.621
<i>Don't put your lovely mother through it.</i>

09:46.656 --> 09:49.457
<i>Just leave it be.</i>

09:49.492 --> 09:52.493
<i>Okay, this is the hardest part,</i>

09:52.528 --> 09:55.296
<i>saying good-bye.</i>

09:55.331 --> 09:58.666
<i>Ezra, you must move on with your life.</i>

09:58.924 --> 10:01.202
<i>You are a good man</i>

10:01.237 --> 10:02.837
<i>with a great heart.</i>

10:02.872 --> 10:04.538
<i>If you weren't,</i>

10:04.574 --> 10:07.575
<i>this probably wouldn't
have happened to you.</i>

10:07.610 --> 10:10.211
<i>And you will find love again.</i>

10:10.246 --> 10:12.813
<i>I know it.</i>

10:14.851 --> 10:16.784
<i>Good-bye, Ezra Bloom.</i>

10:16.819 --> 10:18.519
<i>Salut.</i>

10:18.554 --> 10:22.156
<i>I wish you luck.</i>

10:22.191 --> 10:25.826
<i>I wish you happiness.</i>

10:25.862 --> 10:28.062
<i>Au revoir.</i>

10:43.746 --> 10:45.980
Call Aunt Katherine.

10:54.558 --> 10:56.491
<i>We're sorry; you have reached a number</i>

10:56.527 --> 10:59.494
<i>that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.</i>

11:22.686 --> 11:25.287
I'm booked on the 1:00 flight
to Chicago.

11:25.322 --> 11:26.788
Sure. Name and photo ID, please.

11:26.823 --> 11:29.891
Maddie Jonson. No "h" in "Jonson."

11:29.927 --> 11:32.260
Are you a Madeline or a Madison?

11:33.179 --> 11:34.615
Just Maddie.

11:37.621 --> 11:38.733
Thank you.

11:45.876 --> 11:47.475
Whoa. Good lookin' lady.

11:47.511 --> 11:48.476
Yeah.

11:48.512 --> 11:49.744
Sure like to go where she's goin'.

11:49.780 --> 11:51.379
I'll say.

11:51.415 --> 11:53.081
Careful. Those are expensive.

12:10.233 --> 12:12.400
Hi, there.

12:12.436 --> 12:14.603
Hey, do you mind if I sit down?

12:17.641 --> 12:18.707
So where are we headed today?

12:18.742 --> 12:21.042
Into the world on a big jet plane.

12:21.078 --> 12:22.110
All right.

12:22.145 --> 12:24.012
Excuse me; can I get a beer

12:24.047 --> 12:25.747
and another whatever she's got there?

12:25.782 --> 12:27.482
I haven't decided if
I'm having another yet.

12:27.517 --> 12:28.683
Humor me.

12:31.388 --> 12:32.687
Are you humorous?

12:32.723 --> 12:34.422
Actually, yeah, I am.

12:34.458 --> 12:36.157
People find me humorous.

12:36.193 --> 12:38.960
I'm actually meeting a
bunch of old college buddies

12:38.996 --> 12:40.161
in Pebble Beach.

12:40.197 --> 12:41.229
I could use some female attention

12:41.264 --> 12:42.530
before the bro-fest.

12:42.566 --> 12:44.366
How did I get to be the lucky girl?

12:44.401 --> 12:46.001
Come on; you know you're gorgeous.

12:46.036 --> 12:48.003
A woman likes to be told.

12:48.038 --> 12:49.638
You're gorgeous.

12:49.673 --> 12:51.373
Thank you.

12:51.408 --> 12:54.509
But seriously, you're gorgeous.

12:58.130 --> 12:59.547
Okay, this is weird.

13:00.376 --> 13:01.783
You look like someone I know.

13:01.818 --> 13:03.571
Oh, boy, here we go.

13:03.620 --> 13:05.553
No, no, I mean, it's...

13:05.588 --> 13:08.723
I got to say,
it's absolutely crazy, but...

13:08.758 --> 13:10.258
And you can not be more different,

13:10.293 --> 13:12.426
but you really look
like my sister-in-law,

13:12.462 --> 13:13.594
my brother's wife.

13:13.630 --> 13:15.329
Right, so you're saying

13:15.365 --> 13:17.532
you'd like to have sex
with your brother's wife?

13:17.567 --> 13:19.867
Uh, whoa, nope.
I never said I wanted...

13:19.903 --> 13:21.035
So you don't want to have sex with me?

13:21.070 --> 13:22.637
I never said that either.

13:22.672 --> 13:24.505
You're not really saying
much at all, are you?

13:24.541 --> 13:26.707
Mm-mm.

13:26.743 --> 13:28.442
Want me to help you?

13:28.478 --> 13:29.810
Please.

13:31.981 --> 13:33.414
Okay.

13:34.417 --> 13:36.384
Come here.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.288
Say this to me:

13:40.323 --> 13:46.060
"We are just two strangers in a bar."

13:46.095 --> 13:50.031
We are just two strangers in a bar.

13:50.066 --> 13:52.166
"We're never gonna
see each other again."

13:52.202 --> 13:54.035
We are never gonna see each other again.

13:54.070 --> 13:58.239
"You know, I've always wanted
to take a woman

13:58.274 --> 14:00.474
to an airport hotel."

14:00.510 --> 14:03.444
You know, I've always wanted
to take a woman

14:03.479 --> 14:04.879
to an airport hotel.

14:04.914 --> 14:06.614
"I've always wanted to have sex

14:06.649 --> 14:08.015
with my brother's wife."

14:09.219 --> 14:12.053
- Uh...
- Say it.

14:12.088 --> 14:13.921
I've always wanted to have sex

14:13.957 --> 14:15.022
with my brother's wife.

14:16.793 --> 14:18.693
"And I want you."

14:21.798 --> 14:23.764
"Let's go across the street right now."

14:24.767 --> 14:26.334
I want you.

14:26.369 --> 14:29.136
Let's go across the street right now.

14:33.776 --> 14:35.443
Can't.

14:35.478 --> 14:36.477
Sorry.

14:36.512 --> 14:37.878
What?

14:37.914 --> 14:39.680
Yeah, I got to jet, as they say.

14:39.716 --> 14:43.184
But really nice meeting you, uh...

14:43.219 --> 14:44.919
Jo... Josh. My name's Josh.

14:44.954 --> 14:46.287
- Bye, Josh.
- Wait.

14:46.322 --> 14:47.421
I... I didn't get your name.

14:47.457 --> 14:49.824
No, you didn't.

14:50.793 --> 14:52.893
Holy shit.

14:52.929 --> 14:53.894
Hey, wait!

14:53.930 --> 14:55.463
Oh!

15:00.603 --> 15:02.370
Ava!

15:04.240 --> 15:05.940
Hey, Ava!

15:07.377 --> 15:08.576
Hey!

15:09.579 --> 15:11.445
Excuse me.

15:11.481 --> 15:13.881
You... Ava! Ava!

15:15.985 --> 15:17.451
Oh! Ow!

15:17.487 --> 15:20.087
Ah! What are you doing?

15:20.123 --> 15:23.357
Ava! Ava!

15:23.393 --> 15:25.092
Get off of me, man!

15:25.128 --> 15:27.061
Ah! Oh!

15:27.096 --> 15:29.697
Oh! Oh!

15:29.732 --> 15:31.232
Ow!

15:31.267 --> 15:33.834
Can somebody help us, please?

15:33.870 --> 15:35.303
Ah!

15:35.338 --> 15:36.437
Ow!

15:43.446 --> 15:44.546
Miss, excuse me.

15:44.581 --> 15:45.647
Could you just, uh...

15:45.682 --> 15:47.249
Yeah, of course.

15:52.270 --> 15:53.154
Thank you very much.

15:53.190 --> 15:55.023
You're welcome.

15:56.326 --> 15:58.894
Might want to fix your makeup there,
sweetheart.

16:00.964 --> 16:02.664
God damn it.

16:02.699 --> 16:05.800
Looking pretty good
for a dead man, Mr. Ellis.

16:05.836 --> 16:07.235
Hardy-har-har.

16:07.271 --> 16:09.337
Thanks for the save back there.

16:09.373 --> 16:10.772
Yeah.

16:10.807 --> 16:13.141
What the hell were you
doing with Josh Bloom?

16:13.176 --> 16:14.676
Improvising.

16:14.711 --> 16:17.112
Why the hell didn't you
know he was traveling today?

16:17.147 --> 16:18.046
Don't change the subject.

16:18.081 --> 16:19.915
You have to take it

16:19.950 --> 16:21.850
as close to the flame as possible,
don't you?

16:21.885 --> 16:23.985
And with you,
that is always too goddamn close.

16:24.021 --> 16:26.888
Really? Did you have to break his nose?

16:26.924 --> 16:29.524
Yeah, well...

16:29.560 --> 16:31.826
I always hated that little shit.

16:34.197 --> 16:35.764
So...

16:35.799 --> 16:37.332
how much did we get?

16:52.883 --> 16:54.749
Do you understand that
this is a criminal act?

16:54.785 --> 16:56.318
Yeah, I do understand.

16:56.353 --> 16:58.620
You understand a criminal has
been involved in our lives

16:58.655 --> 17:00.021
for the last year and a half?

17:00.057 --> 17:02.023
- I understand.
- Just get his ass in here.

17:02.059 --> 17:04.693
Get in here.

17:08.498 --> 17:09.631
How you doing, kiddo?

17:10.733 --> 17:12.500
Oh, sweetie.

17:12.536 --> 17:15.036
I am so, so sorry.

17:15.071 --> 17:17.071
What happened?

17:17.107 --> 17:18.272
Did you two have a fight?

17:18.308 --> 17:19.473
No.

17:19.509 --> 17:20.775
Well, what? She just left?

17:20.810 --> 17:23.078
She didn't say anything?

17:23.113 --> 17:26.214
Just something about
cultural differences.

17:26.249 --> 17:28.249
I really liked her, Ez.

17:28.285 --> 17:30.719
And you know me; that's saying a lot.

17:30.754 --> 17:34.723
But I did always feel there
was something about her...

17:34.758 --> 17:36.791
Unspoken, unknowable, I don't know what.

17:36.827 --> 17:40.128
I really don't want
to talk about it, Mom.

17:40.163 --> 17:43.131
Hearts break, Ez.

17:43.166 --> 17:46.201
And then they eventually heal.

17:46.236 --> 17:47.769
Trust me on that.

17:47.804 --> 17:49.504
Ezra, get your ass in here now!

17:49.539 --> 17:53.575
God damn it, Arthur,
take it down a notch!

17:53.610 --> 17:55.543
Do you want me to go in there with you?

17:55.579 --> 17:57.312
No, thanks, Mom.

17:57.347 --> 17:58.713
I'll be fine.

17:58.749 --> 18:00.248
She took all your cash.

18:00.283 --> 18:02.684
She took cash maximums
on all your credit cards,

18:02.719 --> 18:04.319
including the company card.

18:04.354 --> 18:05.820
Yep.

18:05.856 --> 18:07.555
I talked to Ellie Singer
at National Mutual.

18:07.591 --> 18:09.557
Do you know she took out a
second mortgage on your house?

18:09.593 --> 18:11.493
850 grand? Do you know that?

18:11.528 --> 18:12.761
Yep.

18:12.796 --> 18:13.995
She even cashed the bar mitzvah bonds

18:14.031 --> 18:15.096
Bubbie and Zadie gave you.

18:15.132 --> 18:16.698
All 78 bucks?

18:16.733 --> 18:19.134
It's that the point?

18:23.840 --> 18:25.173
Is it?

18:25.208 --> 18:26.174
Nope.

18:26.209 --> 18:27.442
I swear to God, Ezra,

18:27.477 --> 18:28.610
say something besides "yep" or "nope,"

18:28.645 --> 18:29.711
or so help me...

18:29.746 --> 18:30.812
What happened to your face?

18:30.847 --> 18:32.447
Tell him.

18:33.784 --> 18:36.718
I saw Ava at the airport,

18:36.753 --> 18:37.986
dressed as somebody else.

18:38.021 --> 18:39.054
Did you talk to her?

18:39.089 --> 18:40.422
No.

18:40.457 --> 18:41.856
I was following her,

18:41.892 --> 18:43.558
but then she got lost in the crowd.

18:43.593 --> 18:44.626
Good job, Nancy Drew.

18:44.661 --> 18:45.493
Yeah, well, you know what?

18:45.529 --> 18:46.861
The truth is, I was attacked.

18:46.897 --> 18:47.962
- She attacked you?
- No!

18:47.998 --> 18:49.497
This old man came out...

18:49.533 --> 18:50.598
Oh, you were attacked by an old man.

18:50.634 --> 18:51.833
Shut up, both of you.

18:51.868 --> 18:52.901
Here's what we're gonna do.

18:52.936 --> 18:54.135
We're gonna find her,

18:54.171 --> 18:55.437
we're gonna get your money back,

18:55.472 --> 18:57.539
and we're gonna crucify
that French bitch.

18:57.574 --> 18:58.540
She's Belgian!

18:58.575 --> 18:59.941
I don't give a fu...

18:59.976 --> 19:01.176
Here's what we're actually gonna do:

19:01.211 --> 19:03.912
nothing.

19:03.947 --> 19:05.480
We're not gonna do a goddamn thing

19:05.515 --> 19:07.449
except let her go.

19:07.484 --> 19:09.451
- You're delusional if...
- What are you talking about?

19:09.486 --> 19:10.852
You think that that's...

19:20.430 --> 19:21.429
Dad, what is that?

19:21.465 --> 19:23.164
Josh, leave us alone, please.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.166
- Dad, I don't...
- Get out.

19:28.526 --> 19:30.105
All right, fine.

19:37.814 --> 19:39.347
Where'd you get this?

19:39.382 --> 19:41.516
Ava left it in the freezer.

19:43.887 --> 19:46.087
Oh, God.

19:47.624 --> 19:49.891
We're gonna find her.

19:49.926 --> 19:52.060
- Nobody has to know.
- Know what?

19:52.095 --> 19:54.596
That you've been cheating
on Mom for 20 years

19:54.631 --> 19:56.765
with a woman named...
What is it? Chanterelle?

19:56.800 --> 19:57.932
I mean, what it that, a mushroom?

19:57.968 --> 19:59.501
Don't you talk to me like that.

19:59.536 --> 20:01.002
Or that you stole the patent

20:01.037 --> 20:03.071
for the Bloom heel from Uncle Joe?

20:03.106 --> 20:04.939
Which part does nobody have to know?

20:04.975 --> 20:06.975
Because according to Ava,
if we try and find her,

20:07.010 --> 20:08.576
all of it comes out.

20:08.612 --> 20:10.278
You know, if she thinks
she can intimidate me

20:10.313 --> 20:12.113
with this bullshit letter, try.

20:12.149 --> 20:13.148
Bring it on!

20:13.183 --> 20:14.516
Really?

20:14.551 --> 20:16.718
Okay, let's do that.

20:18.221 --> 20:20.188
Hey, Mom,
can I come talk to you for a second?

20:20.223 --> 20:21.656
<i>Of course, sweetheart.</i>

20:21.691 --> 20:23.158
Please don't.

20:23.193 --> 20:25.593
Please.

20:25.629 --> 20:27.729
Maybe you and my so-called wife

20:27.764 --> 20:30.698
have more in common
than we thought, huh?

20:30.734 --> 20:32.033
Liar.

20:32.068 --> 20:33.668
Cheat.

20:33.703 --> 20:34.869
Fraud.

20:34.905 --> 20:36.004
You can't talk to me like that.

20:36.039 --> 20:39.641
Yeah, I can.

20:39.676 --> 20:40.942
Tell Mom I'm sick to my stomach

20:40.977 --> 20:42.677
and I went home.

20:45.248 --> 20:47.515
What are you gonna do, Ezra?

20:47.551 --> 20:50.585
I have no idea.

20:50.620 --> 20:53.054
But I'm not working here anymore.

20:53.089 --> 20:55.957
I quit.

21:13.310 --> 21:15.443
<i>Oh! No, don't... no.</i>

21:19.216 --> 21:21.149
<i>Let me guess.</i>

21:21.184 --> 21:23.184
<i>Sometimes you don't pay for your lunch.</i>

21:23.220 --> 21:25.119
<i>Or maybe you steal</i>

21:25.155 --> 21:27.822
<i>the occasional candy bar or newspaper.</i>

21:27.858 --> 21:29.490
<i>You're a closet rebel.</i>

21:32.629 --> 21:34.429
<i>Oh, that's my telepager.</i>

21:34.464 --> 21:36.064
<i>I got to call the office.</i>

21:54.017 --> 21:55.450
Hello.

21:55.485 --> 21:56.684
<i>We're on.</i>

21:56.720 --> 21:57.819
Already?

21:57.854 --> 21:59.187
<i>You have a problem with that?</i>

21:59.222 --> 22:01.356
No. No, it's fine.

22:01.391 --> 22:03.625
<i>Tuesday.</i>

22:03.660 --> 22:04.859
Tuesday. Got it.

22:04.895 --> 22:06.527
<i>I'm sending the location now.</i>

22:06.563 --> 22:08.329
Okay.

22:33.866 --> 22:35.532
Ezra! Hey!

22:35.567 --> 22:36.600
It's me.

22:36.635 --> 22:37.701
How are you?

22:37.736 --> 22:39.269
That was a dumb question. Sorry.

22:39.304 --> 22:41.571
I... I brought you
some groceries and a plant.

22:41.607 --> 22:43.040
I don't know. It... do you...

22:43.075 --> 22:44.474
Oh, should I meet you over here? Okay.

22:46.345 --> 22:47.711
- Hey.
- Perfect timing.

22:47.746 --> 22:49.379
- I brought some groceries.
- Great. Come in.

22:49.415 --> 22:50.514
Oh, you want to leave them here?

22:50.549 --> 22:52.382
Come on.

22:52.418 --> 22:54.017
Oh, wow. Oh...

22:54.053 --> 22:55.185
Check this out. Hmm?

22:55.220 --> 22:56.820
What?

22:56.855 --> 22:59.690
How weird is that?

22:59.725 --> 23:00.757
What's weird?

23:00.793 --> 23:02.225
Is that the interaction

23:02.261 --> 23:04.227
of two people who don't know each other?

23:04.263 --> 23:06.296
Ava gone, and Katherine gone.

23:06.331 --> 23:08.331
And Mr. Ellis is dead.

23:08.367 --> 23:09.866
Or is he?

23:09.902 --> 23:11.268
No, he's dead. He had a heart attack.

23:11.303 --> 23:13.103
Oh, did anybody see a death certificate?

23:13.138 --> 23:14.204
I don't know.

23:14.239 --> 23:16.073
Nothing is as it seems. Nothing.

23:16.108 --> 23:17.774
I mean, what if Aunt Katherine's
really married to Mr. Ellis?

23:17.810 --> 23:19.142
What?

23:19.178 --> 23:21.078
And they were controlling Ava somehow.

23:21.113 --> 23:22.779
And Mr. Ellis stole the information

23:22.815 --> 23:23.947
on the company and Dad...

23:23.982 --> 23:25.015
What kind of information?

23:25.050 --> 23:27.050
Oh, I... I don't know.

23:27.086 --> 23:29.019
Come on; why else would she do it?

23:29.054 --> 23:31.054
I mean, why would she leave?

23:31.090 --> 23:32.989
Money? We had money.

23:33.025 --> 23:34.691
You know, my wife is gone!

23:34.727 --> 23:36.059
She's gone.

23:36.095 --> 23:38.095
I'm sorry, Ez.

23:38.130 --> 23:41.431
I feel like sometimes people
just fall out of love.

23:41.467 --> 23:43.066
You know?

23:43.102 --> 23:45.969
And they do dramatic things,
especially Europeans.

23:48.107 --> 23:49.973
Listen, why don't I clean this place up

23:50.008 --> 23:51.842
a little bit for you?

23:51.877 --> 23:55.912
Or, you know, I could just call
the hazmat team in to do it.

23:57.850 --> 24:00.650
Look, I think that you just
need to get in the shower

24:00.686 --> 24:02.619
and get out of here for a few hours.

24:02.654 --> 24:04.287
So what do you say we just go to dinner

24:04.323 --> 24:06.790
and get a bottle of wine,
have a good cry,

24:06.825 --> 24:08.692
just us girls?

24:10.195 --> 24:11.995
Come on. Get in the shower.

24:18.403 --> 24:19.770
Hey, you know, I think Josh...

24:19.805 --> 24:21.505
Shower.

24:21.540 --> 24:22.939
All right.

24:22.975 --> 24:25.175
Ew. So gross.

24:26.779 --> 24:29.513
<i>Ezra, this restaurant you brought us to,</i>

24:29.548 --> 24:31.148
is this the same French restaurant

24:31.183 --> 24:33.517
that Ava used to work at?

24:33.552 --> 24:35.652
I'm sorry.

24:35.687 --> 24:37.487
No, it's okay. It's okay.

24:37.523 --> 24:40.190
Maybe it's like...
It's like a boil, you know.

24:40.225 --> 24:42.125
You got to just bring it
to the head and pop it

24:42.161 --> 24:45.262
and get all that Ava pus out of there.

24:45.297 --> 24:48.498
I'm sorry. That was kind of gross.

24:48.534 --> 24:49.900
Why don't you just tell me

24:49.935 --> 24:51.468
about the first night you guys met?

24:51.503 --> 24:53.270
Like, who were you with?

24:53.305 --> 24:54.504
No one.

24:54.540 --> 24:56.640
I used to come here by myself,
bring a book,

24:56.675 --> 24:58.308
and, for a few hours,

24:58.343 --> 25:00.410
imagine I was finally living in Paris.

25:00.445 --> 25:01.545
You wanted to live in Paris?

25:01.580 --> 25:03.346
Oh, yeah, I...

25:03.382 --> 25:05.048
I always thought that after college,

25:05.083 --> 25:07.818
I'd travel through Europe,
end up in Paris,

25:07.853 --> 25:09.152
and be a writer.

25:09.188 --> 25:11.388
You know, standard fantasy fare.

25:11.423 --> 25:13.223
No, I think that's amazing.

25:13.258 --> 25:14.758
Did you ever go?

25:14.793 --> 25:16.893
No, I, um...

25:16.929 --> 25:19.362
I was working for my folks
to save up some travel money

25:19.398 --> 25:21.464
when Josh crashed his stupid car.

25:21.500 --> 25:24.534
So I stayed on to help
for a couple of months,

25:24.570 --> 25:26.136
which turned into a couple years,

25:26.171 --> 25:27.938
which lasted forever.

25:27.973 --> 25:30.507
Until I met Ava.

25:30.542 --> 25:33.910
And then she kind of
became Paris for me.

25:35.814 --> 25:37.547
D-does that make sense?

25:37.583 --> 25:40.183
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

25:41.687 --> 25:44.387
I'm sorry to interrupt your reverie.

25:44.423 --> 25:45.689
My reverie?

25:45.724 --> 25:47.591
No, no, that's all right.

25:50.996 --> 25:53.930
Mon Dieu, I think you are staring at me.

25:53.966 --> 25:55.332
Sorry, I...

25:55.367 --> 25:57.100
May I bring you some wine?

25:57.135 --> 25:58.268
Wine? Yeah.

25:58.303 --> 26:00.737
Sorry, I usually order the, um...

26:02.274 --> 26:03.406
Maybe...

26:03.442 --> 26:04.641
Why don't I choose one for you?

26:04.676 --> 26:07.010
That would be amazing. Thank you.

26:07.045 --> 26:08.979
Okay.

26:11.383 --> 26:13.263
Now you're staring at me.

26:14.319 --> 26:16.853
You have a very kind face.

26:19.858 --> 26:21.758
That's actually the first
thing that I thought

26:21.793 --> 26:23.627
when I met you too.

26:23.662 --> 26:25.629
The kind face.

26:26.798 --> 26:28.798
So did you ask her out that night, or...

26:28.834 --> 26:30.300
Oh, yeah, right.

26:30.335 --> 26:32.268
I... I came back four nights in a row.

26:32.701 --> 26:33.870
- No.
- Yeah.

26:34.883 --> 26:35.705
<i>It became kind of a joke</i>

26:35.741 --> 26:38.008
<i>when I'd arrive every
night at the same table.</i>

27:15.121 --> 27:16.179
Pathetic.

27:16.924 --> 27:18.424
I'm sorry. I'm just so...

27:18.459 --> 27:20.760
- No, it's okay.
- No, it's not!

27:20.795 --> 27:23.696
Screw Ava, and screw Paris too.

27:23.731 --> 27:24.830
I... I'm such a fool.

27:24.866 --> 27:26.365
I've wasted my life

27:26.401 --> 27:27.600
thinking about when I'd get to Paris

27:27.635 --> 27:29.568
or when I quit my job
or when I marry Ava.

27:29.604 --> 27:30.703
It's pathetic!

27:32.607 --> 27:34.640
I have an idea.

27:34.676 --> 27:39.211
What if we just get totally hammered?

27:39.247 --> 27:40.279
Yeah.

27:40.314 --> 27:41.547
- Right?
- Yeah, I see.

27:41.582 --> 27:42.882
Yeah, let's get really, really hammered.

27:42.917 --> 27:44.450
What are we waiting for? Cheers.

27:44.485 --> 27:45.463
Okay.

27:49.444 --> 27:50.743
They don't care.

27:50.779 --> 27:52.145
They don't even know they brought it.

27:52.180 --> 27:53.146
It's not even raining outside.

27:53.181 --> 27:55.715
Hey. Come here.

28:16.137 --> 28:17.904
What? What's the matter?

28:17.939 --> 28:19.839
Is this okay? Am I... is this good?

28:19.874 --> 28:21.207
No, yeah. No, no, it's not you.

28:21.242 --> 28:22.208
Are you sure?

28:22.243 --> 28:23.810
- Ye...
- What is it?

28:23.845 --> 28:24.977
Nothing. It's like...

28:25.013 --> 28:26.345
- You can tell me.
- No, it's...

28:26.381 --> 28:27.547
Is it really kinky? Is it weird?

28:27.582 --> 28:29.315
You can tell me. What is it?

28:29.350 --> 28:32.652
You know, maybe if you,
you know, talk with an accent.

28:34.122 --> 28:35.321
Okay, yeah.

28:35.356 --> 28:36.389
- Yeah.
- Yes.

28:36.424 --> 28:37.924
I mean,<i> oui.</i>

28:37.959 --> 28:39.258
<i>Oui,</i> baby.

28:39.294 --> 28:40.693
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:40.728 --> 28:42.495
We like zat.

28:42.530 --> 28:44.330
- You are so strong.
- Yeah, that's good.

28:44.365 --> 28:45.631
And you make me feel so short.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.867
Ooh, actually, that's a bit too French.

28:47.902 --> 28:50.703
- The Belgian accent's softer.
- Okay.

28:50.738 --> 28:51.704
- Breathier.
- Okay.

28:51.739 --> 28:53.039
Did you see "In Bruges"?

28:53.074 --> 28:54.140
Uh, no, but I got this, yeah.

28:54.175 --> 28:55.942
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:57.245 --> 28:58.711
I have been wanting you.

28:58.746 --> 29:00.079
Now talk a little dirty.

29:00.114 --> 29:01.447
Just do it with the accent.

29:01.483 --> 29:04.717
Okay, um, I've... I want you

29:04.752 --> 29:06.819
to take me in ze butt.

29:06.855 --> 29:09.355
What? No, she wasn't into that.

29:09.390 --> 29:10.723
- I'm not into that.
- Neither am I.

29:10.758 --> 29:12.058
I'm not into that.
I was just saying that...

29:12.093 --> 29:13.192
I thought you... I was just trying to...

29:13.228 --> 29:14.427
Oh, my God, Jesus.

29:14.462 --> 29:15.628
No, I'm sorry. No, I know.

29:15.663 --> 29:18.097
- Oh, my God.
- Um...

29:18.132 --> 29:19.966
Hey, d-do you want to keep going?

29:23.905 --> 29:27.473
Do you want to... make love to me?

29:32.347 --> 29:33.713
Hey, hey...

29:46.594 --> 29:49.028
Sorry. Am I late?

29:49.063 --> 29:51.197
Always, darling. Part of your charm.

29:51.232 --> 29:52.665
Take a look at this.

29:52.700 --> 29:56.168
1968 Faure Regent. It's a classic.

29:56.204 --> 29:57.803
A present to myself from myself

29:57.839 --> 29:59.739
for dealing with the
Blooms for six months.

29:59.774 --> 30:01.741
Mm. Beautiful.

30:01.776 --> 30:02.808
Very nice.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.744
Uh, uh, uh. Thank you.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.146
Now, where are we headed?

30:18.226 --> 30:20.393
We're going to Seattle.

30:20.428 --> 30:21.594
Nice.

30:21.629 --> 30:23.029
Meet Gary Heller,

30:23.064 --> 30:25.731
managing director of the
Pacific Bank & Trust.

30:25.767 --> 30:27.300
It's the largest bank in the city.

30:27.335 --> 30:29.302
His fiancée left him two years ago

30:29.337 --> 30:31.304
for a pool guy.

30:32.440 --> 30:33.806
Oh, wow.

30:33.841 --> 30:35.007
Real looker.

30:35.043 --> 30:36.409
Let's see.

30:36.444 --> 30:37.977
Okay, all right. Are you kidding me?

30:38.012 --> 30:40.212
I'm supposed to fall
in love with this guy?

30:40.248 --> 30:42.114
Hey, don't shoot the messenger, okay?

30:42.150 --> 30:44.850
The Doctor picks 'em,
and we take 'em down.

30:44.886 --> 30:47.053
And our new names, oh.

30:47.088 --> 30:48.554
Florence Burns.

30:48.590 --> 30:50.056
Oh! I'm guessing that's me.

30:50.091 --> 30:51.891
No, actually. It's me.

30:52.652 --> 30:53.759
Jesus Christ.

30:53.795 --> 30:56.195
Is he serious? "Florence"?

30:56.230 --> 30:57.597
Why would the Doctor
give me a name like that?

30:57.632 --> 30:58.664
Maybe he's punishing you.

30:58.700 --> 31:00.066
"Punishing."

31:00.101 --> 31:01.567
We took the Blooms for a million four.

31:01.603 --> 31:03.803
That's, like, what,
one of our five top scores?

31:03.838 --> 31:05.338
You know what?

31:05.373 --> 31:06.606
He keeps giving us all these bad marks.

31:06.641 --> 31:08.608
Then he gets to keep 70% of the money.

31:08.643 --> 31:10.910
I mean, why don't we just
pick our own mark this time?

31:10.945 --> 31:12.278
You know that's not
how it works. Come on.

31:12.313 --> 31:13.646
I'm serious.

31:13.681 --> 31:15.381
Screw the Doctor. Let's just go rogue.

31:15.416 --> 31:18.184
You want us to end up in a goddamn hole?

31:18.219 --> 31:19.251
Do you?

31:19.287 --> 31:21.320
Lighten up.

31:21.356 --> 31:23.506
I was just kidding around.

31:23.541 --> 31:25.241
All right, what's my name?

31:25.276 --> 31:27.476
Saffron Keyes.

31:27.512 --> 31:30.446
Sally, you're going to be
Vivian Sternwood.

31:30.481 --> 31:32.615
Very Raymond Chandler. I like it.

31:34.052 --> 31:36.385
This guy has put away
a shitload of savings.

31:36.421 --> 31:38.254
You know, it says
his housekeeper just quit,

31:38.289 --> 31:39.522
moved to Sacramento.

31:39.557 --> 31:40.923
Maybe that's my play.

31:40.958 --> 31:42.425
This guy would fall for a slug

31:42.460 --> 31:45.261
if it was wearing a
dress and a push-up bra.

31:45.744 --> 31:48.064
I'm gonna make this one fun for myself.

31:51.302 --> 31:52.368
Okay.

31:52.403 --> 31:54.270
See you in the game, guys.

31:54.305 --> 31:55.438
See you in the game.

31:55.473 --> 31:57.373
In the game.

32:04.113 --> 32:06.081
<i>And by the power invested in me</i>

32:06.116 --> 32:07.649
<i>by the State of Indiana,</i>

32:07.684 --> 32:11.486
<i>I now pronounce you husband and wife...</i>

32:11.522 --> 32:15.390
Till death do you part.

32:17.194 --> 32:21.329
<i>Mazel tov! You may kiss the bride.</i>

32:30.865 --> 32:31.840
Screw it.

32:38.769 --> 32:41.804
<i>Please shut the oven door
before selecting temperature.</i>

32:41.939 --> 32:45.240
<i>Please shut the oven door
before selecting temperature.</i>

32:45.276 --> 32:46.375
<i>Please shut the oven door...</i>

32:53.451 --> 32:55.851
Around and around

32:55.886 --> 33:00.389
and then into the hole.

33:03.728 --> 33:06.328

33:09.367 --> 33:11.600

33:11.736 --> 33:13.102

33:40.702 --> 33:42.168
Go away.

33:42.203 --> 33:43.903
I'm killing myself.

33:43.938 --> 33:45.638
<i>Open up!</i>

33:48.143 --> 33:50.143
<i>FBI. Open up!</i>

33:54.449 --> 33:55.681
Yes, sir?

33:55.717 --> 33:57.216
FBI.

33:57.252 --> 33:58.418
There's a problem with your wife.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.153
May I come in? Thank you.

34:00.188 --> 34:01.387
Hey, wait a minute.

34:02.991 --> 34:04.991
What the hell's going on in here, buddy?

34:05.026 --> 34:05.958
Huh?

34:05.994 --> 34:09.262
Oh, I was... housework.

34:10.998 --> 34:12.697
Are you Ezra Bloom?

34:12.734 --> 34:14.233
I am, yes.

34:14.268 --> 34:16.168
Married to Ava Bloom?

34:16.204 --> 34:19.005
Well, uh... yeah.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.706
You don't sound exactly sure.

34:20.742 --> 34:23.509
Are we talking about this...

34:23.545 --> 34:24.911
- Yeah.
- Ava Bloom?

34:24.946 --> 34:26.212
Yeah, that's her.

34:26.246 --> 34:27.313
Oh, my God, is she dead?

34:27.348 --> 34:28.581
What? No, no.

34:28.616 --> 34:29.882
I need to know exactly where she is.

34:29.918 --> 34:31.217
Immediately.

34:31.252 --> 34:33.886
She... she left me, okay?

34:33.922 --> 34:35.321
All right? She's gone.

34:35.356 --> 34:36.922
She took everything.

34:36.958 --> 34:38.791
Shit!

34:43.598 --> 34:46.065
When did she leave?

34:46.101 --> 34:48.400
A month ago.

34:48.436 --> 34:49.502
Who the hell are you?

34:49.536 --> 34:51.137
Federal Burrow of Investigation.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.138
Did she leave a-a video,

34:52.172 --> 34:53.973
a kind of website video thing?

34:54.007 --> 34:55.108
Did you say "Burrow"?

34:55.143 --> 34:56.509
I need to see the video.

34:56.543 --> 34:57.410
Let me see that badge again.

34:57.445 --> 34:58.678
I need you to listen to me.

34:58.713 --> 34:59.779
I need to see the video...

34:59.814 --> 35:01.214
You're not FBI.

35:01.249 --> 35:02.281
Where is she?

35:02.317 --> 35:04.784
Let me see the video. You hear me?

35:04.819 --> 35:06.018
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

35:06.054 --> 35:07.386
- Where is she?
- Not my face!

35:07.422 --> 35:09.155
Where is she? You know where she is!

35:09.190 --> 35:10.356
Oh!

35:10.391 --> 35:12.225
Oh! Where is she?

35:12.260 --> 35:13.759
Calm down. I said calm...

35:13.795 --> 35:15.027
Stop! Stop!

35:15.063 --> 35:16.696
Stop it, man! Stop!

35:16.731 --> 35:18.998
- Stop.
- Who are you?

35:19.033 --> 35:21.834
I am her husband.

35:21.870 --> 35:23.636
Yes, that's right, asshole.

35:23.671 --> 35:25.438
Just like you.

35:25.473 --> 35:27.607
She is my wife.

35:27.642 --> 35:30.143
We married the same woman,
and she took us both.

35:37.986 --> 35:40.653
That stupid bitch totally rui...

35:42.690 --> 35:45.057
Don't call her that.

35:59.174 --> 36:00.773
Good afternoon.

36:00.808 --> 36:01.774
Hi.

36:01.809 --> 36:04.610
I'm here to inquire
about the executive assistant job.

36:04.646 --> 36:06.579
Call him back,
and tell him exactly this.

36:06.614 --> 36:10.016
I don't care if he has to wheel
his hospital bed to his desk.

36:10.051 --> 36:11.884
He is out of sick days!

36:11.920 --> 36:14.887
He comes in today,
or he never comes back!

36:14.923 --> 36:16.055
That's him.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.992
Bet his bark is worse than his bite.

36:20.028 --> 36:23.362
That's what the last two girls said.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.899
Thank you.

36:28.403 --> 36:30.603
You know, the messed-up thing is,

36:30.638 --> 36:32.838
I wasn't even lonely.

36:32.874 --> 36:36.042
I mean, I was an all-county quarterback.

36:36.077 --> 36:37.643
That's big-time.

36:37.679 --> 36:39.912
And they put my name up
on the car dealership,

36:39.948 --> 36:42.315
and I was set up, man.

36:42.350 --> 36:45.117
Good money, good women.

36:45.153 --> 36:46.953
Great women.

36:48.389 --> 36:50.556
Then one day,
this kind of hot older lady

36:50.592 --> 36:52.058
comes into the office

36:52.093 --> 36:54.060
looking for a lease on the new Terminus.

36:54.095 --> 36:56.195
Dynamite little hybrid car.

36:56.231 --> 36:57.830
Usually, I don't do test drives,

36:57.865 --> 37:00.666
but her niece was with her, and...

37:00.702 --> 37:02.101
Wow, man.

37:02.136 --> 37:06.105
So beautiful and smart

37:06.140 --> 37:09.375
and had all these awesome...

37:09.410 --> 37:11.911
words.

37:11.946 --> 37:14.513
And she totally dug me.

37:14.549 --> 37:16.816
Even though she was this super-cultured

37:16.851 --> 37:17.984
New Yorker chick...

37:18.019 --> 37:19.252
New York?

37:19.287 --> 37:21.687
You mean she wasn't
from another country?

37:21.723 --> 37:23.956
No, my friend,
she was from another world.

37:23.992 --> 37:26.726
Upper East Side Manhattan,
Sarah friggin' Lawrence.

37:26.761 --> 37:28.828
World-class.

37:28.863 --> 37:31.564
So I put the aunt in that
sweet little Terminus.

37:31.599 --> 37:33.399
I took Alice out to
dinner the next night.

37:33.434 --> 37:36.702
And four months later, I married her.

37:36.738 --> 37:38.471
My buddies said

37:38.506 --> 37:41.107
it was the best thing
that ever happened to me,

37:41.142 --> 37:44.277
and, you know, it probably was...

37:44.312 --> 37:46.212
until it wasn't.

37:47.615 --> 37:50.449
Anyway, I just spiraled, man.

37:50.485 --> 37:51.917
The whole freaking town knew.

37:51.953 --> 37:53.286
I stopped going to the gym.

37:53.321 --> 37:54.887
I stopped working out.

37:54.922 --> 37:56.856
They took my name down off
the dealership so fast,

37:56.891 --> 37:58.524
it made my head spin.

37:58.559 --> 38:00.626
I tried to drown my sorrows in...

38:00.662 --> 38:03.796
Booze and a lot of crying.

38:03.831 --> 38:07.066
No, I'd just screw just about
every housewife or waitress

38:07.101 --> 38:08.634
who ever slipped me her number.

38:08.670 --> 38:09.935
Woke up one morning.

38:09.971 --> 38:12.171
My junk's all beat up.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.806
I was like, "Come on, Richie.

38:13.841 --> 38:16.642
This isn't you, man."

38:16.678 --> 38:18.177
And I decided right then and there

38:18.212 --> 38:21.080
that I was gonna find Alice myself.

38:21.115 --> 38:24.083
Okay, so...

38:24.118 --> 38:26.252
Ava pretends to be

38:26.287 --> 38:29.055
this classy girl
from New York City, and...

38:29.090 --> 38:31.223
Stop. Ava doesn't exist, okay?

38:31.259 --> 38:33.626
Alice probably doesn't exist either.

38:33.661 --> 38:35.161
She's a con artist, and so is her aunt.

38:35.196 --> 38:36.829
No, I see how it looks like that,

38:36.864 --> 38:39.565
but our... our marriage,
the way we were with each other...

38:39.600 --> 38:41.100
What? She completed you?

38:41.135 --> 38:42.902
She made you feel whole?

38:42.937 --> 38:44.904
Yeah, well, I could have been,
like, a senator

38:44.939 --> 38:46.339
or a philanthropist or something

38:46.374 --> 38:47.940
with her on my arm.

38:53.848 --> 38:57.516
Do you have a picture of... Alice?

39:03.458 --> 39:06.158
And now she's out there, somewhere,

39:06.194 --> 39:07.360
probably working some new guy,

39:07.395 --> 39:09.495
looking like some new chick.

39:10.932 --> 39:13.632
What do you know about
facial recognition software?

39:13.668 --> 39:15.234
Like "Mission: Impossible III"?

39:15.269 --> 39:16.602
What? No.

39:16.637 --> 39:18.371
Like iPhoto but, you know, much bigger.

39:18.406 --> 39:20.206
Oh, yeah, no, I'm a PC guy.

39:20.241 --> 39:22.641
Okay, um, how much money do you have?

39:22.677 --> 39:24.176
I don't know. Maybe 300 bucks?

39:24.212 --> 39:25.745
I have five.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.713
And this watch and your watch?

39:27.749 --> 39:29.615
Come on. Let's go.

39:29.650 --> 39:31.350
What?

39:31.386 --> 39:33.686
No, man, I love this watch.

39:34.534 --> 39:35.547
Come on!

39:45.421 --> 39:47.054
Hey.

39:47.089 --> 39:48.489
<i>I'm just gonna put these in the car.</i>

39:48.524 --> 39:49.523
<i>- Okay.
- Be good.</i>

39:49.558 --> 39:50.991
<i>Yup.</i>

39:51.027 --> 39:52.659
<i>- Oh, not right now.
- Give me a bite.</i>

39:52.695 --> 39:54.061
<i>- No!
- But I'm asking nicely.</i>

39:54.096 --> 39:55.796
<i>- Too bad.
- I want a lick!</i>

39:55.831 --> 39:56.797
<i>- No.
- Just a lick.</i>

39:56.832 --> 39:58.232
<i>It's mine.</i>

39:58.267 --> 39:59.867
I keep thinking I want kids.

39:59.902 --> 40:01.702
<i>Mom, he hit me in the face!</i>

40:01.737 --> 40:03.370
<i>Evan, that's it. No, you're done.</i>

40:03.406 --> 40:05.506
<i>- What?
- The entire weekend.</i>

40:05.541 --> 40:07.107
<i>- It's mine!
- Get in the goddamn car.</i>

40:07.143 --> 40:08.442
<i>- What the...</i>
- I don't know.

40:08.477 --> 40:10.310
I find that inspiring.

40:10.346 --> 40:11.812
I'm sorry. Inspiring?

40:11.847 --> 40:13.747
Oh, yeah,
that little girl has potential.

40:13.783 --> 40:15.382
If I were her mother,
I'd give her a prize.

40:15.418 --> 40:17.718
For being manipulative?

40:17.753 --> 40:20.320
For taking care of herself.

40:20.356 --> 40:23.090
Most girls take a long time
to learn a trick like that.

40:23.125 --> 40:24.324
Huh.

40:24.360 --> 40:26.060
Well, that's not very feminist of you,

40:26.095 --> 40:27.828
but okay.

40:27.863 --> 40:29.463
I don't agree at all.

40:29.498 --> 40:32.599
And are you really talking
to me about feminism?

40:32.635 --> 40:34.201
We just met.

40:35.438 --> 40:36.737
You're right. You're right.

40:36.772 --> 40:38.539
I'm sorry. My bad.

40:38.574 --> 40:39.807
You're forgiven.

40:39.842 --> 40:42.209
Good. Name's Patrick, by the way.

40:42.244 --> 40:43.777
Saffron.

40:43.813 --> 40:45.913
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

40:47.550 --> 40:50.684
Okay, I, uh, better get going.

40:50.719 --> 40:52.019
I'm applying for a big job today.

40:52.054 --> 40:53.987
Wish me luck.

40:54.023 --> 40:57.724
Well, you don't seem like
you need much luck, but...

40:57.760 --> 40:59.059
good luck.

40:59.095 --> 40:59.893
Thank you.

40:59.929 --> 41:01.495
No work for you today?

41:01.530 --> 41:04.665
No, no, no work for me ever.

41:04.700 --> 41:05.866
Well, at least until I figure out

41:05.901 --> 41:07.267
what I want to do next.

41:07.303 --> 41:09.670
Problems of the idle rich, I guess.

41:09.705 --> 41:12.473
Yeah, something like that.

41:12.508 --> 41:14.208
All right. Take it easy.

41:14.243 --> 41:15.776
All right, you too.

41:18.214 --> 41:20.414
I can't believe you made me sell that.

41:20.449 --> 41:22.015
That watch was good luck, man.

41:22.051 --> 41:23.884
My high school girlfriend's
mom gave it to me...

41:23.919 --> 41:25.652
You want to find Ava or not?

41:25.688 --> 41:28.355
Alice. Yes, duh.

41:28.390 --> 41:30.257
Then it's a necessary sacrifice.

41:34.930 --> 41:38.132
So the initial fee for
the facial match is...

41:38.167 --> 41:40.134
It's 1,000 American dollars.

41:40.169 --> 41:41.902
Whoo! Yowza.

41:41.937 --> 41:44.671
Will you throw in these
binoculars for that?

41:44.707 --> 41:46.206
Put that down.

41:51.480 --> 41:52.980
How long do you think it'll take?

41:53.015 --> 41:55.082
An hour, a day, a month.

41:55.117 --> 41:56.583
Depends.

41:56.619 --> 41:58.452
Leave me your number. I'll be in touch.

42:37.259 --> 42:39.459
Could you maybe just stop?

42:39.495 --> 42:41.762
Need to stay in shape.

42:41.797 --> 42:43.397
Need to stay strong

42:43.432 --> 42:44.898
while we wait.

43:13.629 --> 43:16.263
I told you to get pasta and rice!

43:16.298 --> 43:18.632
No, we need an ideal balance of carbs,
protein, and fat.

43:18.667 --> 43:20.767
Okay, this is a lean
plant-based protein...

43:20.803 --> 43:23.370
This is now all the food we have?

43:23.405 --> 43:25.505
What, do you think
we got a blender in the car?

43:25.541 --> 43:27.307
Do you know how completely
moronic this is?

43:27.343 --> 43:30.444
Yo, I suggest you seriously
watch your syntax with me, bro.

43:30.479 --> 43:32.145
Okay, you know what?

43:32.181 --> 43:33.347
I don't think this teamwork
thing's gonna work.

43:33.382 --> 43:35.315
Well, I was just gonna say

43:35.351 --> 43:36.683
I don't think this teamwork
thing's gonna work.

43:36.719 --> 43:38.285
- Fine.
- Fine.

43:38.320 --> 43:40.187
Also, I think you're a major pussy.

43:40.222 --> 43:41.922
Hello? Yeah, well,
I think you're an actual idiot.

43:41.957 --> 43:44.258
You're an actual pussy!

43:44.293 --> 43:47.127
Really?

43:47.162 --> 43:49.129
Wow.

43:49.164 --> 43:50.597
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

43:50.633 --> 43:53.000
Um, yeah, sure, I'll be right down.

43:53.035 --> 43:54.201
Thanks.

43:54.236 --> 43:56.570
Is that the guy from the spy shop?

43:58.007 --> 44:00.107
Dude.

44:00.142 --> 44:01.775
All right, let's get one thing straight.

44:01.984 --> 44:04.385
Just 'cause you were right
about that facial recognition thing

44:04.385 --> 44:06.847
doesn't make you, like,
the boss or anything.

44:06.882 --> 44:07.981
Please stop talking.
