00:56.360 --> 00:57.873
Right this way, sir.

00:59.840 --> 01:00.909
Come on in, please mind your feet.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.592
Move towards the back, please.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.156
Constable Higgins, what have you?

01:27.800 --> 01:31.554
Well, the streetcar made it a stop down
the line before the incident was noted.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.913
And as for the victim, it's...
It's a real puzzle, sir.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.429
Indeed?

01:41.080 --> 01:44.152
Doctor, I hear we have something
out of the ordinary.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.915
Well, a single gunshot wound the torso.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.116
- I suspect it hit the heart.
- Hmm.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.316
Brazen, but hardly odd.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.035
According to Constable Higgins,
no one heard the shot.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.876
- Ah.
- Ah, indeed.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.912
Perhaps, he was shot elsewhere.

01:59.600 --> 02:00.999
Given the severity of the wound,

02:01.080 --> 02:03.548
he would have left an
impressive blood trail and there's none.

02:03.920 --> 02:04.989
Hmm.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.354
So if he was shot where he sits,

02:09.320 --> 02:10.389
and no one heard...

02:11.760 --> 02:14.877
A stray bullet,
some boys shooting at bottles...

02:15.000 --> 02:17.116
Or some unrelated dispute?

02:17.760 --> 02:20.593
- Return ticket from New York City.
- Wow.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.352
Wow. We've given him quite the welcome.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.273
Something to write home about.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.674
If you find anything else out, Doctor...

02:29.120 --> 02:30.189
As usual.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.037
Henry, impound this streetcar please.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.189
Yes, sir.

02:45.280 --> 02:49.068
According to his business card our
victim is a Wilbur Delory Esquire.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.594
539 Gilmore Street, New York.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.995
Have George enquire with the
New York City Police, please.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.514
Yes, sir. Oh, uh and, sir,

02:57.320 --> 03:00.949
a few riders saw a man in a boater hat
board the car with Mr Delory, sir.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.230
They were having a friendly
conversation, by all accounts.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.038
- And where is this man?
- He got off the car

03:05.120 --> 03:06.235
before it left the station, sir.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.038
I'm afraid no one saw his face clearly.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.471
Perhaps he was just seeing
Mr Delory on his way?

03:10.720 --> 03:12.233
Interesting turn of phrase, Henry.

03:13.960 --> 03:17.919
Henry, get this man's description,
such as it is, out on the wire.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.873
And have the men canvass the area
for any reports of gunfire.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.235
Straight away, sir.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.595
Uh, sir!

03:32.680 --> 03:34.989
As per your request, I have
wired New York City Police

03:35.080 --> 03:36.399
about Mr Delory's information.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.515
Very good, George.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.512
Sir, there is a rather fetching lady
waiting for you in your office.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.110
Oh, I am not expecting anyone.
Who is she?

03:43.200 --> 03:45.760
Oh, from the little we spoke,
I gathered that you two are acquainted.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.316
- Who is she?
- Sir, I haven't the foggiest.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.595
Thank you.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.518
Anna Fulford! My goodness.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.393
Hello, William.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.839
What brings you to Toronto?

04:02.400 --> 04:05.392
I'm on my way to Niagara Falls
with my fiancé.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.149
Your fiancé? Ah.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.195
Congratulations.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.149
William, he's vanished.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.515
Vanished?

04:12.600 --> 04:13.953
I'm at my wit's end.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.550
I think something terrible
must have happened.

04:21.079 --> 04:22.149
Ladies and gentlemen.

04:23.640 --> 04:26.552
Yes, listen... Absolutely...
I appreciate your concern.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.829
- I understand...
- What now?

04:32.360 --> 04:35.238
I think we need to deal with this
in an orderly fashion.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.470
Crabtree, get here.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.712
Sir, it seems there has been a rash
of petty crimes in their neighbourhood.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.957
Pick pocketing, laundry stolen
off clothes lines, missing chickens...

04:44.040 --> 04:45.189
Chickens?

04:45.280 --> 04:46.395
I have a theory, sir.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.552
- Make it quick.
- A gypsy caravan

04:48.640 --> 04:50.073
has just set up camp down by the river.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.838
Gypsies. Bloody thieves.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.637
Well, sir, the gypsy concept of
ownership is different from ours.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.233
- Well, sort it out.
- Sir, I will.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.151
- Where will you be?
- My office.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.111
My campaign manager's stopping by.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.429
Ah...

05:03.960 --> 05:05.393
It'll be quieter in here.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.033
I'm sorry to bother you, William.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.076
I couldn't think what else to do.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.357
It's quite all right, I would have been
upset if you hadn't come to me, Anna.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.751
Now, please tell me what happened?

05:14.840 --> 05:17.877
Well, Joe left our hotel
at about seven o'clock last night

05:17.960 --> 05:19.598
to look for a tobacconist.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.910
We were supposed to meet for dinner
in the hotel restaurant

05:22.000 --> 05:23.592
at half past and he never arrived.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.718
He literally went out for tobacco
and never came back.

05:27.080 --> 05:31.312
Forgive me for asking, Anna,
but were you and he having troubles?

05:31.400 --> 05:32.469
No!

05:33.760 --> 05:36.274
We were on our way to Niagara Falls
to get married.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.956
I'm sorry, William,
I didn't mean to snap.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.275
It's quite all right.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.509
And Joe's last name?

05:44.720 --> 05:45.835
Bell.

05:46.200 --> 05:49.272
A few months after you and I had our
adventure in Bristol,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.434
I finally plucked up
the courage to sail to New York.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.351
Joe was the best thing about that place.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.077
It's loud and filthy.
And people are horrible.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.191
I take it Joe is the exception.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.799
He is.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.440
Strong and forthright. Kind.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.552
There aren't many like that.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.480
Anyway, a short while after, he proposed

06:14.560 --> 06:17.438
and I thought all my dreams
had come true.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.948
We'll find him, Anna.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.836
Look at me, I haven't even asked
how you've been.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.235
Oh, I'm well.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.950
And Julia, you and she still...

06:29.960 --> 06:32.599
Uh, we're still very close, yes.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.475
Julia is engaged to another.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.592
Oh, William, I'm sorry.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.716
That's quite all right. I'm fine.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.233
Now, I'll need a description of Joe.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.632
Yes, he's um, he's about your build,

06:46.960 --> 06:48.871
dark complexion, I suppose you'd say,

06:48.960 --> 06:50.552
a moustache and black hair.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.313
What is it, William?

06:57.720 --> 07:01.998
This new look of yours is going
over very well with the voters

07:02.360 --> 07:03.679
and the press, Tommy.

07:03.760 --> 07:06.433
So I hear. Now what's this all about,
Isaac?

07:06.520 --> 07:09.557
Well, it seems that you are
in a tighter horse race

07:09.640 --> 07:11.835
with your opponent
than we had hoped for.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.718
But, just days ago, you said that
Ellis Cornwall was dead in the water.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.109
- What's happened?
- Things change quickly in politics.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.556
Cornwall's anti-immigrant stand
has become increasingly popular,

07:21.640 --> 07:23.710
as a result
he has gained significant support

07:23.800 --> 07:26.314
for his opposition
to the subway project as well.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.432
Cornwall says no to any new idea.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.192
Bloody Luddite is what he is.

07:30.280 --> 07:32.669
Because he understands people
are afraid of change.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.069
- Now he is savvy.
- He's a numbskull.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.748
- People will see through that.
- Don't be simple, Tommy.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.478
Trust the people's judgement
and you're doomed.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.279
And the immigrant issue beside,
without you on city council,

07:42.440 --> 07:44.317
we don't have sufficient numbers to pass

07:44.400 --> 07:46.595
the subway project vote next month.

07:46.680 --> 07:50.593
Now, Edwin Drury and the rest of your
backers at the land consortium

07:50.680 --> 07:51.749
are getting nervous.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.351
- So what do we do?
- We beat Cornwall at his own game.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.273
And an opportunity to do just that

07:58.440 --> 07:59.793
has landed on our door step.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.678
- It has?
- The gypsy crime spree.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.595
Crime spree? A few minor thefts.

08:05.720 --> 08:08.075
There is nothing minor about it, Tommy.
In fact, you have just released

08:08.200 --> 08:10.873
a statement saying that you are
shocked at these brazen gypsies,

08:10.960 --> 08:14.350
that you intend to lock up the guilty
and run the rest out of town.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.556
When did I release
this statement exactly?

08:16.640 --> 08:18.756
It'll be in all the afternoon papers.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.797
But we've barely had time to look
into these crimes.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.995
A statement's premature.

08:22.080 --> 08:25.072
Ah, not if you want to convince
the voters that, as alderman,

08:25.160 --> 08:28.596
you will be their champion
of law and order.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.949
That you intend to right the ship.

08:32.280 --> 08:35.590
To see your dream of
"Toronto the good" come true.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.950
Now you've promised that
in all your speeches.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.155
Don't you want to show them
that was more than just words?

08:41.600 --> 08:42.669
Of course, I do.

08:42.840 --> 08:47.709
That's my boy, Tommy.
It's time to draw a line in the sand.

08:48.200 --> 08:54.309
Now go right that ship and show those
gypsies who they're really dealing with.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.314
Is this Joe?

09:04.320 --> 09:06.788
Anna, I know how difficult
this must be for you.

09:10.520 --> 09:11.748
It's not Joe.

09:12.120 --> 09:14.031
Thank God, he's still alive.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.235
Right then.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.880
I believe what would be best now
is for you to get some rest.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.469
I'll let you know
as soon as there is news.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.193
Constable Morris,
please escort Miss Fulford to her hotel,

09:24.400 --> 09:26.152
and stay there with her
until I can join you.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.239
Thank you, William.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.069
She's lovely.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.438
Poor thing, I can't imagine
how I'd feel in her situation.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.829
Well then, it would appear that
Mr Delory is, in fact, himself.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.077
Has your post-mortem
revealed anything, Doctor?

09:50.160 --> 09:51.229
Yes.

09:51.440 --> 09:53.112
I recovered this slug.

09:53.280 --> 09:58.035
.32 calibre. Given the powder burns,
Mr Delory was shot point blank.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.311
Mr Delory was shot point blank.
Ruling out a stray bullet.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.036
I don't understand, Julia.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.076
The passengers
would have heard a gunshot.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.555
I know, I've no explanation either.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.793
And I found this.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.228
Metal filings.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.954
They were embedded in the wound
and the victim's jacket.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.195
As if they were also fired from the gun?

10:28.080 --> 10:30.753
If so, you're dealing
with a most unusual weapon.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.835
I believe I need to return
to the scene of the crime.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.759
Metal filings, sir?

10:43.960 --> 10:46.315
Yes, like those recovered
from the victim's body.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.159
Henry, I'll need you to gather
a few items for me.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.349
Certainly, sir.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.755
From where?

10:53.840 --> 10:54.909
The millwright.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.075
Right then, who's in charge here?

11:07.680 --> 11:10.638
When I ask a question,
I expect an answer.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.676
You've got till the count of three
before we take action.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.431
One, two...

11:17.520 --> 11:19.829
Put those damn sticks away.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.596
What are you then? Their queen?

11:23.960 --> 11:25.598
He thinks I'm a gypsy queen.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.358
Well, you must be the police king.

11:29.640 --> 11:32.632
I'm Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.
Just who the hell are you?

11:32.720 --> 11:35.188
<i>- I am a phuri dae.
- The fairy what?</i>

11:35.320 --> 11:38.869
It means wise woman. I am the one who
will speak with you, only me. Come.

11:40.880 --> 11:41.949
And no weapons.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.835
Uh, sir, I should come with you
just to make sure that your safety is...

11:46.040 --> 11:48.156
Just keep your eye on this lot,
Crabtree.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.069
Yes, sir.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.557
So, Miss whatever your name is,

11:58.160 --> 12:00.628
there's been a crime spree in this
neighbourhood since you lot turned up.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.470
Really? Well, I will tell my clan to be
on guard for those criminals.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.558
Don't play coy with me.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.751
Your clan needs to pack up and move on.

12:09.040 --> 12:13.238
Inspector Brackenreid, gypsies are used
to persecution, we aren't intimidated.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.396
Please show me the evidence against us.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.871
You're trespassing on city property.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.439
You've got until noon tomorrow
to be gone.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.351
Otherwise, I can't answer
for what might happen.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.795
Neither can I.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.274
Murdoch.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.348
Ah, sir, how did it go with the gypsies?

12:39.440 --> 12:40.509
Bunch of goat herders.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.669
That well.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.231
They'll be gone by tomorrow,
if they know what's good for them.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.029
What are you working on?

12:46.240 --> 12:48.708
That's a speculative notion
at the moment.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.311
To do with this impossible shooting
of yours?

12:51.400 --> 12:52.435
- Yes sir.
- How is that going?

12:53.200 --> 12:57.352
Well, we've confirmed that the victim
was a Wilbur Delory from New York City,

12:57.480 --> 12:59.630
in town on business
according to his family.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.473
Two incidents both involving
New York City residents.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.319
Delory and Miss Fulford's
missing fiancé.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.391
Yes, sir. Perhaps there's a connection.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.594
The fiancé knew this other bloke,
had a row with him, killed him and ran.

13:10.680 --> 13:11.795
Could be as simple as that.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.519
The thought had crossed my mind.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.394
Keep an eye out, Murdoch.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.479
Miss Fulford's runaway groom could be
a bit of a dangerous character.

13:22.720 --> 13:23.789
Sir.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.553
Constable Morris just telephoned
from the Imperial Hotel.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.713
Miss Fulford took a message at the front
desk from her fiancé.

13:29.800 --> 13:30.835
Indeed.

13:31.280 --> 13:34.033
Have Morris stay put with Miss Fulford
until I can get there.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.792
Sir, Morris just found this out now.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.313
He thought Miss Fulford was in her room.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.278
I don't understand, George.
Where is Miss Fulford now?

13:40.360 --> 13:42.635
- She is on her way to meet her fiancé.
- What?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.752
Do we have any idea where she was going?

13:44.920 --> 13:46.672
The man at the front desk who took
the message

13:46.760 --> 13:48.716
said the Gerard Street Bridge, sir.

14:10.960 --> 14:11.995
Anna!

14:15.280 --> 14:16.508
Anna!

14:17.000 --> 14:20.276
William! I finally...

14:23.000 --> 14:24.911
What the hell are you doing?

14:28.240 --> 14:30.879
Joe would never harm anyone,
let alone try and kill me.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.197
But he contacted you with instructions
that led you into an ambush.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.239
Anna, just how well
did you know him really?

14:38.600 --> 14:39.828
Just what does that mean?

14:40.120 --> 14:42.315
Well, you've had a whirlwind romance.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.438
And you barged into my pub with
a bullet through your arm a year ago,

14:45.520 --> 14:47.033
begging me to believe
you weren't a murderer.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.031
So don't you dare question
my judgement.

14:49.200 --> 14:53.716
Isn't it possible that your love for Joe
has blinded you to the truth about him?

14:57.120 --> 15:01.796
If I am to help you find Joe I'll need
to know everything you know about him.

15:04.760 --> 15:05.829
Where do I start?

15:06.800 --> 15:07.915
Was he well off?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.149
Where did he work?

15:10.080 --> 15:13.311
He has his own business,
shipping cargo forth and back to Europe.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.833
What sort of cargo?

15:15.840 --> 15:16.875
I'm not sure.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.276
That's all right,
we can find all of that out,

15:19.640 --> 15:21.437
if you just tell me
the name of the company.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.229
I don't actually know.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.269
You weren't far off
when you said whirlwind.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.312
Oh, this is embarrassing.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.554
Did Joe ever mention a Wilbur Delory?

15:41.080 --> 15:42.832
I don't think so. Who is he?

15:43.680 --> 15:46.558
He's the unfortunate gentleman
I showed you in the morgue.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.599
And he had a bullet in him.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.910
You seriously suggesting that
the man I love

15:52.000 --> 15:54.878
is going about Toronto shooting people
and probably trying to kill me?

15:54.960 --> 15:56.632
I don't know anything at the moment,
Anna,

15:56.720 --> 15:59.029
but I do know that I don't wish
to see you harmed.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.396
Joe would never harm me.
I know he wouldn't.

16:08.920 --> 16:09.989
Is that it?

16:10.080 --> 16:11.559
Virtually no noise.

16:11.920 --> 16:15.151
I got the idea after reading
about Hiram Maxim's attempts

16:15.240 --> 16:17.913
to muffle the sound of
internal combustion motors.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.150
So this is a muffler, so to speak?

16:20.240 --> 16:21.275
Yes, George.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.477
Which would explain why no one
on the street car heard the gunshot.

16:24.560 --> 16:25.788
Insidious is what it is.

16:25.880 --> 16:26.949
I agree.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.838
The key to this muffler,
as you call it, George,

16:29.920 --> 16:32.753
is the sound dampening properties
of metal filings,

16:33.120 --> 16:35.759
stuffed into a series of conical baffles
along the length...

16:35.840 --> 16:38.354
Silencer, that has a better ring to it.

16:38.440 --> 16:39.509
I am sorry, sir.

16:39.600 --> 16:40.874
Along the length of the cylinder.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.871
Baffler. That's the ticket.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.592
So those metal filings are like the ones
found in the victim's wound?

16:46.960 --> 16:50.032
Correct, sir. They'd have been blown out
of the gun with the force of the shot.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.990
Murdoch, a man travels all the way
from New York City to commit murder,

16:54.120 --> 16:55.917
and uses a highly-specialised device

16:56.000 --> 16:57.558
that ensures he can slip away
into thin air.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.073
What does that sound like to you?

16:59.400 --> 17:01.709
I believe we are dealing with
an assassin.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.268
- Tommy, we have a problem.
- We do?

17:14.480 --> 17:16.277
Mr Drury, good to see you again.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.238
I took care of our problem, gentlemen.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.670
The gypsies will be gone by tomorrow,
one way or another.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.478
You should have run them out of
town on sight, Inspector.

17:23.319 --> 17:24.912
A number of my neighbours
on Jarvis Street,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.037
many of whom I convinced to contribute
to your campaign,

17:28.160 --> 17:30.310
were burglarised last night
by those low lives.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.672
What makes you think
it was the gypsies?

17:32.960 --> 17:36.032
My son Edward Junior and his friends
saw the gypsy men themselves.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.915
From our drawing room.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.150
The thieves were breaking into
number 28.

17:40.520 --> 17:41.873
First, a minor crime wave,

17:42.240 --> 17:43.912
now these major thefts

17:44.000 --> 17:45.592
by these immigrant peasants.

17:46.120 --> 17:48.793
Ellis Cornwall will rake you
over the coals with this

17:48.880 --> 17:50.313
unless you react with an iron hand.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.516
But we can still turn this
to your advantage,

17:52.600 --> 17:55.239
but we need arrests and we need
the caravan out of town

17:55.320 --> 17:57.754
before the evening papers
hit the streets.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.671
I can see your point, gentlemen.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.037
But, that's not how I left it with them.
We should give the gypsies a chance...

18:03.120 --> 18:04.838
Brackenreid? You've...

18:06.280 --> 18:09.556
We've got a potential disaster
on our hands.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.596
Just get back to that camp
and get them the hell out of there.

18:12.640 --> 18:15.393
And I'm sending the press,
so I don't want any mistakes.

18:16.840 --> 18:20.196
Everything Mr Drury's consortium has
worked for depends upon this, Tommy.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.350
Everything you've worked for.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.069
You wanted to see me, Doctor?

18:35.680 --> 18:38.717
Yes, I've received a request from
Mr Delory's family

18:38.800 --> 18:40.756
to have his remains
returned to New York.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.629
Yes, I see no reason why not.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.835
Right.

18:45.560 --> 18:49.473
I'll release the body to the mortician
the family made arrangements with.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.357
He's to ship the body
to a funeral parlour in New York City.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.589
Very good.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.075
Is there something else?

18:58.160 --> 18:59.195
Yes.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.636
I suppose I was wondering how you'll
keep Miss Fulford safe,

19:02.760 --> 19:04.591
now there's been an attempt made
on her life.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.713
Well, I have asked her
to remain at the station house,

19:07.800 --> 19:09.870
until I can arrange protective custody.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.599
- And once the killer's caught...
- Why can't she stay with me?

19:14.080 --> 19:15.308
- With you?
- Yes.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.510
The killer would never think to
look for her in my home,

19:17.600 --> 19:19.318
and she'd be more at ease.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.069
Yes, but...

19:21.160 --> 19:22.798
Consider what
Anna's going through, William.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.553
If the gunman is her fiancé,
then she has been horribly betrayed

19:25.640 --> 19:27.790
and she's lost the love of her life.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.435
It's heartbreaking.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.075
Indeed.

19:34.560 --> 19:35.675
I'll arrange it.

19:37.880 --> 19:38.915
Right, you lot, there's no need
for trouble

19:39.000 --> 19:42.197
but if that's
what you want, I'm happy to oblige.

19:42.280 --> 19:45.590
Thomas... Tommy Brackenreid
is fair but tough.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.069
You getting all this down, Glynn?

19:47.200 --> 19:48.235
Every golden word.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.992
- Good lad.
- Inspector!

19:50.120 --> 19:52.076
You will stop this immediately.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.720
Ma'am, I'll ask you to stay back
for your own safety.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.076
It's all right, Crabtree.
What you've got to understand

19:58.240 --> 20:01.118
is that there is no point crying over
this, the decision has been taken.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.235
By who?

20:02.920 --> 20:06.276
Oh, I see. So you are
following someone else's orders.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.475
You are a messenger boy.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.039
You've got nothing to complain about.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.429
If it wasn't for me, we'd be
rounding everybody up, not just the men.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.589
You gave us until tomorrow.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.830
You were going nowhere and you know it.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.276
So I am the liar. Well, in that case,
you leave me no choice.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.836
What you seek, you shall never gain.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.275
What's that supposed to mean?

20:26.480 --> 20:28.675
She is remarkable. Who is she?

20:28.760 --> 20:30.239
Never you mind, get on with your job.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.356
Sir, I just think she put a gypsy curse
on you.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.591
- Curse, was it?
- Thank you. She did no such thing.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.189
Right, you lot, come on. Chop-chop.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.268
I don't know how to thank you
for your kindness, Doctor.

20:47.920 --> 20:48.989
Call me Julia.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.716
May I ask you a personal question,
Julia?

20:53.560 --> 20:54.595
Of course.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.029
Well, the way William spoke of you
in Bristol,

20:58.400 --> 21:01.198
I got the feeling that you and him
were destined for each other.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.993
But, now you're engaged
to someone else, so...

21:05.480 --> 21:06.799
I was wondering...

21:07.480 --> 21:08.549
What happened?

21:08.760 --> 21:10.637
I didn't mean to pry. It's just...

21:11.480 --> 21:13.436
Well, it's important to me
that William's happy.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.349
It's good of you to care for him.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.597
I still do, very much.

21:20.320 --> 21:24.359
But, it became obvious
that our futures were

21:25.960 --> 21:27.951
just not compatible.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.110
Must be true what they say,

21:34.280 --> 21:36.271
"Love isn't always enough. "

21:41.480 --> 21:43.596
Sir, your signature is needed.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.275
The customs form regarding
Mr Delory's body.

21:46.520 --> 21:47.635
Yes, of course.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.634
What is it, George?

21:52.720 --> 21:55.109
Well, sir, with respect
to the Jarvis Street break-ins,

21:55.200 --> 21:58.192
the inspector, he hasn't even asked
to interview any of the residents.

21:58.280 --> 22:01.716
He's just taking it on Edwin Drury's
word that it was the gypsies.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.952
There's a saying, George,
"It's just politics. "

22:05.040 --> 22:06.519
- Yes, but, sir...
- Don't worry.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.478
I'll make sure that the thefts
are thoroughly investigated very soon.

22:09.560 --> 22:12.757
In the mean time,
the inspector needs our support.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.475
And discretion.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.269
Yes, sir.

22:17.440 --> 22:18.555
That's odd.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.951
The funeral home that Mr Delory's
body is meant to be shipped to.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.515
It's different than the one
his family requested.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.674
No one should disturb the dead,
not even the police.

22:35.720 --> 22:36.789
Mr Palmer.

22:37.160 --> 22:39.958
We contacted Mr Delory's family
in New York City

22:40.120 --> 22:43.749
and they had no idea arrangements
for Mr Delory's body had been changed.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.599
But they contacted me directly.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.035
Someone contacted you,

22:48.120 --> 22:49.633
but it wasn't Mr Delory's family.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.151
And whoever it was, has been going to
great lengths to obtain his body.

22:53.320 --> 22:54.435
I want to know why.

23:04.280 --> 23:05.793
Sir, that body is sitting
awfully high up.

23:06.760 --> 23:10.799
Mr Delory seems anxious to escape
this shipping coffin, Mr Palmer.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.108
Can you explain why?

23:12.200 --> 23:13.269
I cannot.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.355
It's a false bottom, sir.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.509
If you please, George.

23:21.880 --> 23:22.949
One, two...

23:28.600 --> 23:29.635
Oh, my.

23:32.600 --> 23:36.354
Well, George, it appears we found
Miss Fulford's fiancé.

23:46.920 --> 23:47.989
I'm sorry, Anna.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.789
I need some air.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.035
- I'll come with you.
- William.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.229
She needs time to herself.

23:55.840 --> 23:56.955
Of course.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.839
I have preliminary results.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.517
Joe Bell died of a single gunshot wound
to the abdomen.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.269
.32 calibre.
The same as the other victim.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.676
And I found metal filings in the wound.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.115
Time of death?

24:12.400 --> 24:13.435
Roughly 24 hours ago.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.878
He was killed before Mr Delory?

24:17.920 --> 24:19.797
Why are these two men dead?

24:20.280 --> 24:22.953
And why on earth would someone
want Anna dead as well?

24:24.360 --> 24:28.876
And why would the killer ship Joe
Bell's body back to New York in secret?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.113
It's a conundrum to be sure, sir.

24:33.200 --> 24:37.398
Whatever his reason, the killer comes
up with this double coffin deception.

24:38.200 --> 24:42.398
But he needs a second corpse,
to put on top of Joe Bell's body.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.992
So, he must have known
Delory was from New York.

24:47.040 --> 24:51.556
The streetcar witnesses claim two men
were chatting moments before the murder.

24:53.040 --> 24:56.077
So, the murderer killed Delory
simply because he needed a corpse?

24:57.360 --> 24:59.351
Sir, the disregard for human life...

24:59.760 --> 25:00.829
Indeed, George.

25:01.320 --> 25:03.675
This assassin is well suited
to his calling.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.391
I don't believe we've seen
his like before.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.760
Bloody hell, Glynn.
What were you thinking, eh?

25:11.080 --> 25:12.877
You're supposed
to write about the arrests.

25:12.960 --> 25:14.109
Not this curse bollocks.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.714
But a gypsy curse.
How could I ignore a thing like that?

25:16.840 --> 25:17.875
I thought we had a deal.

25:18.120 --> 25:19.917
I give you scoops
over all the other broadsheets

25:20.000 --> 25:21.513
in exchange for good press

25:21.600 --> 25:22.669
on my station house!

25:22.880 --> 25:25.952
On your station house, yes,
not your political aspirations.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.234
Is it possible you've confused the two?

25:28.360 --> 25:31.352
If your reporting costs me
this election,

25:31.680 --> 25:33.875
I guarantee I'll find a way
to make you sorry.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.478
Is that a quote, Inspector?

25:39.280 --> 25:40.508
- Sir.
- What do you want, Crabtree?

25:41.600 --> 25:45.195
Sir, the gypsy women have begun
a sort of vigil outside...

25:45.280 --> 25:46.395
Outside? Are you serious?

25:46.680 --> 25:47.954
Yes, sir. That wise woman of theirs

25:48.040 --> 25:50.110
says that they won't leave
until their men are released.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.869
Shall I have the lads
try to move them off?

25:52.520 --> 25:55.159
What, with Glynn out there lurking,
ready to make a fool out of me again?

25:57.520 --> 26:00.512
Sir, if I were an objective observer,
which I believe I am,

26:00.680 --> 26:01.749
I might observe that...

26:03.560 --> 26:07.394
Sir, I believe that your policing
methods have suffered of late.

26:11.240 --> 26:12.753
Did I hear you correctly, Crabtree?

26:13.520 --> 26:14.589
Yes, sir.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.035
What?

26:24.360 --> 26:26.316
Oh, Mr Drury. So sorry.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.631
Yes, sir. I'll be right there.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.591
Where are those Jarvis Street
break-in reports?

26:36.680 --> 26:38.477
I'll fetch them, sir.

26:40.880 --> 26:41.995
I never saw the man, Detective.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.595
I received a telephone call.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.310
And this caller, what did he offer you?

26:48.040 --> 26:49.473
The continued use of my legs.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.629
I see.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.231
Mr Palmer, how did the second body
get into the coffin

26:56.320 --> 26:58.117
without you seeing who put it there?

26:58.800 --> 27:02.759
The caller asked me to prepare the
Delory corpse and then go for a stroll.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.395
I was to leave the door open
and come back in an hour.

27:06.680 --> 27:07.749
That's all I know.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.752
Detective, who are these people
that threaten such ghastly violence?

27:20.040 --> 27:22.156
Sir, the break-in reports.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.589
Detective.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.955
The men have been showing photos
of Joe Bell around town

27:30.040 --> 27:33.032
and discovered he made a visit to Union
Station not long before he was killed.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.719
- He was alone?
- Yes, sir.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.792
Why return to Union Station?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.389
Well, apparently, he stored
several items while in transit.

27:39.480 --> 27:42.153
He requested access to a piece
of luggage and then left the station.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.318
Beyond that, I'm afraid the trail
goes cold, sir.

27:44.880 --> 27:48.077
Whatever he was doing, it was certainly
without Miss Fulford's knowledge.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.989
We need to find out
what he put into storage, Henry.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.195
Sir.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.234
How do you do it, Murdoch?

28:47.040 --> 28:48.109
Joe loved this watch.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.635
Kept terrible time.

28:53.720 --> 28:54.789
These are the rest of his effects.

28:56.720 --> 28:57.835
Thank you.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.631
What will you do, when all this is over?

29:04.560 --> 29:05.913
Start again, I suppose.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.198
Though it's hard to imagine how.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.870
I suppose we become so accustomed
to the shape of our lives,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.594
we're convinced that no other
is possible.

29:16.720 --> 29:17.789
And, yet, of course it is.

29:20.440 --> 29:22.908
You know, I've fallen for two men
in the space of a year,

29:23.720 --> 29:24.789
and I've lost them both.

29:26.760 --> 29:27.829
There's always the nunnery.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.275
Two men?

29:31.120 --> 29:32.235
One was Joe.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.432
The other walked into my pub in Bristol.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.632
And his heart belonged to another.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.389
Oh.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.992
My chaperone is growing impatient.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.073
- I'd return to the safety of your home.
- Of course.

29:51.840 --> 29:52.909
Thank you.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.671
I have to say I'm surprised at you,
Tommy.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.837
Very surprised.

30:05.440 --> 30:07.351
I asked a simple thing
and you made a mess of it.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.070
The round-up went exactly to plan,
Mr Drury.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.474
So, Paddy Glynn's the problem.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.474
- Don't look to side step the blame.
- I beg your pardon?

30:14.800 --> 30:15.994
Who was it who sent him down there?

30:16.120 --> 30:18.918
Inspector, I will not accept failure.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.389
You need to counter attack
after this fiasco.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.629
I'm open to ideas.

30:25.520 --> 30:30.036
Well, there is something
that might right the ship, sir.

30:31.160 --> 30:32.229
I'm listening.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.792
Perhaps your family would care to attend
the theatre this evening.

30:37.320 --> 30:38.992
I could teach Joe Bell a thing or two.

30:39.120 --> 30:41.509
When I travel, I pack one valise
and a shoe box.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.990
Henry, a one-hour carriage ride to your
mother's house isn't travelling.

30:45.080 --> 30:48.277
- Where would you like this monstrosity?
- Right here on the work table, George.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.149
Right, then.

30:52.440 --> 30:55.591
Let's see what brought Joe Bell
to Union Station.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.355
I'm betting it's another body, sir.
It often is.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.669
"It often is," Henry?

31:07.080 --> 31:08.195
And we have...

31:11.520 --> 31:12.635
Tin cans.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.357
No doubt full of body parts, Higgins?

31:22.440 --> 31:24.112
Inside, is...

31:26.000 --> 31:27.797
- Oil.
- Sir.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.399
Olive oil, to be precise.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.512
Who would go carting around gallons
of olive oil while they're on vacation?

31:34.840 --> 31:36.114
There's something in here.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.833
What on earth...

31:50.040 --> 31:51.234
American $20 bills.

31:52.840 --> 31:55.308
Sir, if the other tins are filled with
the same, there's a fortune here.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.559
Sir, who was this Joe Bell?
How did he come by all this money?

31:59.800 --> 32:03.554
I have no idea, George. But it's a fair
bet that this is why he was murdered.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.797
The paper itself is low grade.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.791
High in linen, lacking in cotton.

32:11.920 --> 32:15.833
And if you look at Alexander Hamilton's
buttons, there are two.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.035
There should be three.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.632
So, this Joe Bell was a counterfeiter
who couldn't count.

32:20.760 --> 32:21.795
No, in fact,

32:21.880 --> 32:26.158
according to the US Secret Service,
this counterfeiter is a forger,

32:26.240 --> 32:27.355
who lives in Sicily.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.114
Sicily? How did this fake money
end up in New York?

32:30.800 --> 32:34.429
Miss Fulford said that her fiancé
Joe Bell had a shipping company.

32:34.880 --> 32:35.995
Various cargo.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.231
Some of which was Sicilian olive oil?

32:38.640 --> 32:41.029
Yes. Now, the question is
whether or not Mr Bell

32:41.120 --> 32:45.272
was part of this counterfeiting ring or
if he simply happened upon the money.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.433
Well, either way, he helps himself
to a few tins and he makes a run for it.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.831
Yes and the rightful owners sent
an assassin to track him down.

32:51.960 --> 32:52.995
And the rightful owners are?

32:53.280 --> 32:56.238
The New York City Police
have no knowledge of this Joe Bell.

32:56.320 --> 32:59.198
But they did recognise
the double coffin ruse.

32:59.680 --> 33:03.992
It's a technique used by an organised
crime group called The Black Hand.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.951
It allows them to transport
victims they don't want discovered.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.072
Pragmatic cutthroats.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.595
Apparently this Black Hand
has its roots in Sicily,

33:13.680 --> 33:16.069
but has been moving into
New York City's Italian community.

33:17.400 --> 33:20.073
First a band of gypsies,
now something called organised crime.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.039
"Toronto the good" indeed.

33:22.640 --> 33:25.234
So, do you have a plan to put
a stop to this business?

33:25.720 --> 33:26.755
- I might.
- Brilliant.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.715
'Cause I have a crime wave
of my own to deal with.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.076
Oh, yes, I've heard.
And you hope for a speedy conclusion?

33:34.680 --> 33:35.749
I do.

33:36.160 --> 33:38.594
With the actual thieves behind bars,
if you're wondering.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.428
- I was not.
- Good.

33:41.840 --> 33:45.037
Now, you have some
unpleasant business to attend to.

33:46.640 --> 33:47.675
Yes.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.876
Joe would never associate with this
Black Hand.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.033
He was a good soul.

33:52.440 --> 33:53.509
No doubt.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.110
But he did steal from The Black Hand.

33:57.080 --> 33:58.229
And it cost him his life.

33:58.600 --> 33:59.669
And put yours in jeopardy.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.070
I swear, I had no idea
what Joe was doing.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.069
And I believe you.

34:07.840 --> 34:11.992
But the attempt on your life would
suggest The Black Hand feels otherwise.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.350
And it's this mistaken belief

34:14.440 --> 34:15.793
that's the basis for my idea.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.514
- To catch his killer?
- Yes.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.838
Now, it stands to reason that
The Black Hand wants the money back.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.349
And I intend to give it to them.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.710
Why would you want
to give those murderers anything?

34:25.239 --> 34:26.389
To draw out the assassin.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.596
I'll send them a telegram,
pretending to be you

34:29.679 --> 34:32.069
and that you know
what they've done.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.835
Anna will offer the money
in exchange for her life.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.996
And when the killer presents himself,

34:38.920 --> 34:39.955
he'll be apprehended.

34:40.320 --> 34:41.547
And how will you contact them?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.150
There is a funeral parlour
in New York City

34:44.239 --> 34:46.117
I believe The Black Hand
uses as a cover.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.469
I'll wire them the specifics of where
and when the exchange is to take place.

34:53.239 --> 34:54.639
Well, I want to be there with you.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.475
It's far too dangerous.

34:56.880 --> 35:00.031
But the killer will expect to see me.
If he doesn't, he might slink away

35:00.120 --> 35:01.189
and you'll never catch him.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.316
Anna, I will not use you as bait.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.878
William, if our roles were reversed,

35:06.960 --> 35:09.315
if you were after the killer
of the woman you loved,

35:09.400 --> 35:10.992
you would not want to be denied a role.

35:13.560 --> 35:14.993
No, I would not.

35:15.560 --> 35:16.675
Right.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.908
So, what can I do to help?

35:39.400 --> 35:41.550
Have you come to beg me
to lift the curse?

35:41.680 --> 35:42.749
No.

35:43.520 --> 35:45.078
Something even more difficult than that.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.149
I'm here to admit that I was wrong.

35:48.760 --> 35:49.829
Yes?

35:50.960 --> 35:52.837
I know your men
didn't commit those break-ins.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.439
But apologies aren't going to get them
out of the situation they're in.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.632
So, your words are empty.

35:58.840 --> 35:59.909
No.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.629
I do have a plan.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.029
But I need your help.

36:04.640 --> 36:05.675
Release my men first.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.275
I can't.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.955
For this to work,
they must remain in jail one more night.

36:10.880 --> 36:11.995
May I?

36:15.400 --> 36:16.879
The public has to believe
the men are free.

36:17.720 --> 36:20.553
I need your women to cancel their vigil
outside my station house.

36:21.080 --> 36:23.071
And suppose your big plan doesn't work?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.230
Well, for one thing,
you won't have to curse me again.

36:27.160 --> 36:28.275
I'll have the whole city doing that.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.394
And the Police King will fall?

36:31.840 --> 36:32.955
He will.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.989
Well, well, well, what do we have here?

37:19.880 --> 37:21.518
They're friends of my son, Edwin Junior.

37:21.760 --> 37:25.070
Yes, the ones so eager to give
statements blaming the gypsies.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.439
It was Edwin Junior's idea.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.551
- That's rubbish.
- It's true, I swear.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.073
What was Edwin Junior's idea?

37:32.320 --> 37:33.355
Speak!

37:33.680 --> 37:35.910
To rob each other's house
when our families were out.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.797
These boys are just trying
to get my son in trouble.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.912
No. I don't think so.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.875
You see, Mr Drury,
I went back over your boy's statement.

37:43.640 --> 37:45.471
Before I came back up here
this afternoon,

37:45.560 --> 37:47.198
I stopped off in front of number 28.

37:48.320 --> 37:51.790
There's no line of sight between there
and that drawing room window.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.870
Which means that your boy and these two
were lying when they said

37:56.960 --> 37:58.951
they saw the gypsies
breaking into the place.

38:00.120 --> 38:01.235
It was a set-up.

38:01.760 --> 38:03.671
And I'm afraid your son
instigated it all.

38:04.640 --> 38:05.755
Well, thank you, Inspector.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.034
You can rest assured
that my son will be dealt with severely.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.998
Actually, there'll be no backroom deals.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.435
I'll have my men arrest
Edwin Junior at the theatre.

38:15.280 --> 38:16.349
I'd think twice about that.

38:16.840 --> 38:19.400
You will humiliate my family and theirs.

38:19.880 --> 38:20.949
Tommy.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.993
This may not be the smart move.

38:24.480 --> 38:25.708
What are you saying, Lowe?

38:26.360 --> 38:29.033
Well, politics is all about
the compromise

38:29.120 --> 38:33.989
the give and the take,
so you give a little on this and then

38:34.400 --> 38:35.594
you take a little on that.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.309
Are you attempting to bribe
an officer of the law?

38:42.360 --> 38:43.395
Of course not.

38:43.480 --> 38:46.472
You told me to make this city,
"Toronto the good. "

38:46.640 --> 38:47.675
And I'm doing just that.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.119
Let's not mince words here, Tommy.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.590
You're making a mistake that will go
far beyond throwing your campaign away.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.637
Bribes, threats.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.472
Now, I may not know much about politics,

38:57.960 --> 38:59.359
but I do know about the law.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.914
And you two are that close
to breaking it.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.156
Boys, outside.

39:04.240 --> 39:07.755
- Tommy, Tommy.
- The name is Inspector Brackenreid.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.276
And I say to hell with politics.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.593
You two can dig that subway
your bloody selves.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.397
I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to take
the next car.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.074
But this is the last one.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.997
- We have an extra one running tonight.
- I don't see why I can't take this one.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.915
- We're on a very tight schedule.
- Tight schedule?

40:24.080 --> 40:25.308
These cars never run on time.

40:26.160 --> 40:28.151
Sir, I'm sorry. I'm going to have
to ask you to step aside.

40:28.240 --> 40:29.275
I have to make my shift.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.793
If I'm late, I'll be sacked.

40:30.880 --> 40:31.915
Sir, I understand.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.319
- What is the issue?
- Look, sir.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.589
Drop your weapon.

40:51.880 --> 40:52.949
Anna.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.075
What on earth?

40:56.120 --> 40:57.314
He murdered Joe.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.152
Come on.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.996
Joe Bell was a member of The Black Hand.

41:12.240 --> 41:15.198
He handled shipping of the counterfeit
money into New York City.

41:16.320 --> 41:20.518
All of that was going smoothly, until he
met and fell in love with Anna Fulford.

41:21.640 --> 41:22.709
And then he wanted out.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.149
So he took the money
to start their new life together.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.635
Correct me if I'm wrong.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.840
So The Black Hand sent you
to kill Joe Bell.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.951
And in bringing his body back
to New York City,

41:37.040 --> 41:38.996
it would send out a very clear message,

41:39.960 --> 41:43.714
"Steal from The Black Hand,
it will find you and kill you. "

41:47.840 --> 41:51.150
Anna Fulford is innocent.
She played no part in this.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.112
No, we don't see it that way.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.794
- No harm will come to her.
- You don't understand.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.193
Someone will replace me.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.876
If they fail, they will be replaced.

42:03.400 --> 42:04.515
The woman will die.

42:05.800 --> 42:07.597
The Black Hand does not forget.

42:08.520 --> 42:09.635
It will come for her.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.914
And for this city.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.115
So you're off?

42:22.840 --> 42:23.909
It's better this way.

42:24.560 --> 42:26.551
They say Peterborough
is a nice little town.

42:27.400 --> 42:28.992
So I've heard. Lots of chickens.

42:31.320 --> 42:32.719
I never would have thought this
a couple of days ago,

42:32.800 --> 42:33.835
but I think I'll miss you.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.149
Your clan, I mean.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.358
Thank you, Inspector. You'll forgive us
if we don't send postcards.

42:39.560 --> 42:40.629
Right.

42:40.720 --> 42:43.075
And I'm glad that you're here,
because I have to lift the curse.

42:43.160 --> 42:44.229
Don't bother.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.392
It wasn't actually a curse,
as it turned out.

42:48.200 --> 42:49.269
I must be losing my touch.

42:49.880 --> 42:52.155
Take care of yourself, Inspector,
you're one of the good ones.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.349
I never did get your name.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.269
Mirela.

43:00.760 --> 43:01.829
Mirela.

43:04.440 --> 43:08.069
So, these people will hunt me down
and kill me simply to save face?

43:08.200 --> 43:09.315
I'm afraid so.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.512
- I'm not sure if I can resign myself to that.
- You don't have to.

43:13.320 --> 43:14.514
But you just said...

43:14.720 --> 43:16.950
Anna, I can't protect you.

43:18.120 --> 43:19.189
But I can help you hide.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.997
I don't want to run and hide, William,
I want to stay here.

43:23.760 --> 43:24.829
You can't.

43:27.920 --> 43:29.069
Bristol, then. I could go home.

43:33.840 --> 43:35.876
We've had these documents
made up for you.

43:37.120 --> 43:41.079
They're your new identity.
A new name, a new past...

43:42.000 --> 43:43.069
Everything you'll need.

43:45.840 --> 43:46.989
But where will I go?

43:47.960 --> 43:49.075
What am I gonna do?

43:49.240 --> 43:53.358
Anna, what's important is surviving
to be able to make those decisions.

43:56.160 --> 43:57.878
I'm so sorry,
but it's the best I can do.

44:01.280 --> 44:05.956
How did this happen? Both of us
losing the futures we counted on?

44:07.840 --> 44:10.798
Perhaps, when enough time has passed,
you could come to me.

44:10.960 --> 44:12.029
No.

44:12.760 --> 44:16.878
No. You must never tell anyone
what's become of Anna Fulford.

44:17.240 --> 44:18.309
Not even me.

44:19.160 --> 44:21.469
To do so would place us both
in great danger.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.269
So this really is goodbye?

44:31.440 --> 44:32.555
I'll miss you, William.

44:36.720 --> 44:37.789
Thank you.

44:39.640 --> 44:40.709
Good luck, Anna.
