00:16.347 --> 00:18.338
Here it is... First day of college.

00:18.515 --> 00:19.707
What do you say, Veronica?

00:19.867 --> 00:21.267
New school, fresh start...

00:21.347 --> 00:24.334
How about you try not to piss
anyone off this time around?

00:29.043 --> 00:31.977
Welcome to college,
where it's okay to skip class.

00:33.447 --> 00:34.986
Just not mine.

00:35.248 --> 00:38.283
Skip class? I'm gonna
staple myself to the floor.

00:39.354 --> 00:41.621
Before we dive in,
I've been asked to plug

00:41.677 --> 00:43.829
the criminology department's
mentoring program.

00:44.106 --> 00:46.373
We work with at-risk kids
here in Neptune.

00:46.563 --> 00:49.791
Our philosophy is that it's better
to prevent crimes through intervention

00:50.067 --> 00:51.323
than be forced to solve them later.

00:51.929 --> 00:53.862
My teaching assistant, Timothy Foyle,

00:53.936 --> 00:55.930
will take the names of those
who would like to volunteer.

00:56.756 --> 00:58.262
Here's your reading list
for the semester.

00:59.037 --> 01:00.752
All should be available used
at the co-op.

01:00.838 --> 01:02.731
What about your book, dr. Landry?

01:02.845 --> 01:04.842
Profiling is an upper-level course.

01:05.078 --> 01:06.590
Got to walk before we run.

01:08.686 --> 01:10.980
All right, what do you say
we start off the semester

01:10.988 --> 01:12.642
with a little bit of ridiculous fun?

01:14.315 --> 01:16.431
Murder... on the Riverboat Queen.

01:17.566 --> 01:18.811
If Tim hands you an envelope,

01:18.995 --> 01:20.632
that makes you a passenger
and a witness

01:20.896 --> 01:22.100
On the Riverboat Queen.

01:22.696 --> 01:23.900
Go ahead, open your envelope.

01:24.206 --> 01:26.372
It'll give you all the details you need to play
this role... Who you are, what you saw.

01:26.658 --> 01:28.971
If you're the murderer,
you're given your cover story.

01:29.386 --> 01:30.520
Now, if you're not given a card,

01:30.555 --> 01:33.903
that makes you one of the pinkertons
brought on board to solve the case.

01:34.188 --> 01:36.812
You can question any of the passengers.

01:37.515 --> 01:41.100
The current record for solving the case
is 16 minutes,

01:41.375 --> 01:43.493
courtesy of the amazing mr. Foyle.

01:44.967 --> 01:46.252
All right, detectives.

01:46.486 --> 01:48.481
You may begin questioning
your passengers...

01:50.035 --> 01:51.250
now.

02:18.325 --> 02:19.322
Yes?

02:19.536 --> 02:21.630
Dr. Landry expects everyone
to participate.

02:22.286 --> 02:24.411
Is it possible you ended up
in the wrong class?

02:24.956 --> 02:27.623
Your academic advisor can get you
into something else, you know.

02:28.226 --> 02:29.441
Elementary education, maybe.

02:29.616 --> 02:31.083
I think it's okay to read
magazines over there.

02:31.088 --> 02:33.371
They even cut them up sometimes,
make little collages.

02:34.886 --> 02:36.143
I know who did it.

02:39.135 --> 02:41.372
- Dr. Landry.
- What you got?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.281
This girl says she's got it.

02:43.636 --> 02:44.733
But she hasn't moved from her seat.

02:45.936 --> 02:46.971
And you are?

02:47.208 --> 02:48.673
Veronica Mars.

02:48.685 --> 02:51.760
So, Veronica Mars,
who are you going to send to prison

02:51.816 --> 02:53.651
for the rest of his natural-born days?

02:55.816 --> 02:58.701
The blind... Yet not really blind...

02:58.807 --> 03:00.842
fiddle player, Rutherford Stiles.

03:05.647 --> 03:07.202
Congratulations, Veronica.

03:07.856 --> 03:09.353
All right, everybody, you can stop.

03:09.366 --> 03:11.771
We have a winner
and a new record-holder.

03:11.958 --> 03:13.013
Six minutes.

03:13.966 --> 03:15.613
So, how'd you figure it out?

03:16.458 --> 03:19.690
"Murder on the riverboat queen"
Was a murder mystery in a box game

03:19.696 --> 03:21.783
made by Wigwam Toys in the late '80s.

03:22.318 --> 03:24.560
Fans of the game set up
message boards online

03:24.605 --> 03:26.351
that gave away details.

03:26.816 --> 03:28.400
I just ignored all the spoiler alerts,

03:28.408 --> 03:30.352
which I know is kind of
douchebaggy, but...

03:30.495 --> 03:33.422
The game is set in the 1890s.
You can't use the internet.

03:34.397 --> 03:35.480
Was that a rule?

03:35.686 --> 03:36.603
It wasn't a rule.

03:36.608 --> 03:39.153
And there are two
possible killers in the box.

03:39.408 --> 03:41.531
You just took a 50/50 stab, didn't you?

03:41.656 --> 03:45.151
Sorry, no. The other killer
is Countess McGee.

03:45.388 --> 03:47.802
Dr. Landry just asked me who
I was going to send away

03:47.846 --> 03:49.670
for the rest of HIS natural-born days.

03:50.236 --> 03:52.080
That kind of sold me
on blind Rutherford.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.362
There is one thing I can't figure out,
though.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.910
What did you do for
the extra 10 minutes?

04:02.195 --> 04:04.301
<i>A long time ago,</i>

04:04.497 --> 04:07.111
<i>We used to be friends, but I...</i>

04:07.315 --> 04:11.222
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

04:12.548 --> 04:14.360
<i>Come  on, now, sugar!</i>

04:14.707 --> 04:16.831
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

04:17.108 --> 04:20.361
<i>Just remember me when...</i>

04:20.505 --> 04:22.701
<i>We used to be friends</i>

04:22.786 --> 04:24.890
<i>A long time ago</i>

04:25.076 --> 04:27.102
<i>We used to be friends *</i>

04:28.505 --> 04:30.982
<i>Veronica Mars 3x01
Welcome Wagon</i>

04:35.637 --> 04:37.213
You a bounty hunter, boy?

04:39.905 --> 04:42.680
I really shouldn't have pushed
for the Clint Eastwood marathon.

04:42.756 --> 04:44.122
Now I've ruined you.

04:45.517 --> 04:47.482
I didn't think it was possible
to make you more butch.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.232
Stupid, stupid Logan.

04:52.056 --> 04:54.963
Well, want to feel like a man?
Walk me to class?

04:55.578 --> 04:56.591
Carry your books?

04:56.595 --> 04:57.702
Why not?

05:00.018 --> 05:01.550
Guess who I saw on campus today?

05:02.225 --> 05:03.591
Some girl going wild?

05:03.787 --> 05:06.531
As I understand it,
It happens all the time in college.

05:07.295 --> 05:08.733
I'm on the verge of it right now.

05:09.136 --> 05:10.680
No Dick, my B.F.F.

05:11.868 --> 05:13.903
I thought he was crashing
with his dad in the caymans.

05:13.917 --> 05:14.831
Nah, he's back.

05:15.307 --> 05:16.251
You guys talk?

05:16.718 --> 05:18.470
Yeah, but it was brief.

05:18.758 --> 05:21.862
Shouted his name, flipped me off.
The bonds of friendship.

05:22.677 --> 05:24.581
It was enough of a struggle
getting you into Hearst.

05:24.645 --> 05:26.040
How do you think he managed it?

05:26.337 --> 05:28.931
Well his mom remarried
Schwarzenegger's business manager.

05:29.005 --> 05:30.303
- Ah...
- Yeah...

05:30.435 --> 05:31.591
I'm sure a call from the governor

05:31.636 --> 05:34.602
can get you into most colleges
in the state.

05:36.858 --> 05:40.302
Hey, some people are saying
Dick's a mess,

05:41.378 --> 05:45.081
you know, on account of his brother
Greg Louganis-ing off my roof.

05:45.488 --> 05:47.633
It wasn't your fault Cassidy jumped.

05:48.455 --> 05:49.881
Nothing's ever my fault.

06:15.286 --> 06:18.112
Vinnie... what brings you
to the good part

06:18.117 --> 06:19.882
of the wrong side of the tracks?

06:20.475 --> 06:23.512
Dollar signs, mi amigo.
The almighty buck.

06:23.895 --> 06:27.422
I got a case that requires
a little double-detective duty.

06:28.147 --> 06:30.471
Lucky Pierre owns a jewelry store

06:30.477 --> 06:32.772
And suspects that
he's got an embezzler.

06:34.116 --> 06:37.172
What do you say, huh?
Wonder twin powers, activate.

06:37.178 --> 06:40.242
Can't, Vinnie... Got my own case,
And it's taking me out of town.

06:40.625 --> 06:43.421
A hit? I understand
there's good money in that.

06:43.425 --> 06:45.731
How does one break in?
Is there a union of some kind?

06:46.517 --> 06:47.751
Put in a good word for me, would you?

06:49.718 --> 06:52.270
You know, I thought about
getting myself a briefcase.

06:52.278 --> 06:53.510
Not that I really need it.

06:54.207 --> 06:56.800
You  know, everything I need,
I keep right up here.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.702
Vinnie... I'm busy.

07:00.218 --> 07:02.633
Okay, okay. If you want to be that guy.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.330
Dad? Come here.

07:13.647 --> 07:16.011
-  You beckoned.
- Yeah. You'll never believe it.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.050
A maid from our hotel in New York

07:18.098 --> 07:20.782
found the flash card with
all our vacation pictures on it.

07:21.317 --> 07:22.382
Hot dog!

07:23.995 --> 07:24.953
"Hot dog"?

07:24.955 --> 07:27.802
It's an expression
of excitement and enthusiasm.

07:28.157 --> 07:30.972
Joe and Frank Hardy and I used to say
"hot dog" all the time

07:30.976 --> 07:32.251
while we were waiting for the carhop

07:32.297 --> 07:34.151
to bring us our malteds
at the drive-in.

07:34.697 --> 07:35.422
Drive-in?

07:35.428 --> 07:37.120
- I hate you.
- You love me.

07:37.208 --> 07:38.672
Yeah, but it's all instinct.

07:38.898 --> 07:41.211
Okay, you'll notice
the first couple dozen photos

07:41.273 --> 07:43.911
feature your daughter doing
the one-handed self portrait,

07:44.327 --> 07:47.053
as her negligent father
showed up three days late.

07:47.399 --> 07:49.872
But look. You finally make it.

07:50.565 --> 07:52.761
Here we are in front of the "Spamalot".

07:54.418 --> 07:57.422
Here we are in front
of the Empire State building.

07:57.937 --> 07:59.230
That's the Chrysler building.

07:59.797 --> 08:00.591
No, it isn't.

08:00.857 --> 08:02.193
Veronica, there are
a few things in life

08:02.197 --> 08:04.613
to which you will have to defer
to my age and experience,

08:04.615 --> 08:08.113
and that, sweet child of mine,
is the Chrysler building.

08:08.698 --> 08:11.762
Senility...
that comes with age, too, right?

08:13.128 --> 08:14.692
I can't remember.

08:16.145 --> 08:18.121
Oh, by the way, how was your first day?

08:18.416 --> 08:19.951
How does it feel
being a college student?

08:20.196 --> 08:22.153
Oh, it's exhausting.

08:22.437 --> 08:24.340
I had one whole class today.

08:24.595 --> 08:26.641
- Did you make any friends?
- Lord, no.

08:27.097 --> 08:28.100
Enemies?

08:29.245 --> 08:31.353
Yeah, well, it is a day
that ends in a "y".

08:31.397 --> 08:34.711
Hey, you mess with the bull, okay?

08:35.765 --> 08:39.600
Look, here you are stuffing cupcakes
in your face at Magnolia Bakery.

08:40.136 --> 08:42.030
Say, you remember
I'm gonna be gone a few days,

08:42.547 --> 08:44.169
That bail-jumper I've been tracking?

08:44.335 --> 08:45.543
I'll hold down the fort.

08:45.627 --> 08:49.451
Yeah, I'm afraid I put Backup
in charge while I'm away,

08:49.456 --> 08:51.301
and he's been instructed
to maul your boyfriend

08:51.378 --> 08:52.493
if he's here past midnight.

08:52.646 --> 08:53.990
Backup's in charge?

08:54.605 --> 08:56.562
What about the bitch he's been seeing?

09:03.426 --> 09:04.852
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:05.286 --> 09:06.662
You must be my roommate, Stosh?

09:06.667 --> 09:08.391
Uh, call me "Piz".

09:08.847 --> 09:11.572
But you're... Wallace?

09:12.788 --> 09:14.001
I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.

09:14.076 --> 09:15.223
On my roommate-request form,

09:15.228 --> 09:17.772
I specifically said I didn't want
a roommate who was...

09:18.968 --> 09:19.863
you know...

09:23.398 --> 09:24.253
What?

09:24.257 --> 09:26.191
Better-looking than me.
I made it very clear.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.913
Sorry, man.
Fairest of them all right here.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.161
Took this side. I hope that's cool.

09:32.166 --> 09:33.333
Yeah, no sweat.

09:33.527 --> 09:35.842
I rarely wear clothes indoors.
I hope that's cool.

09:36.685 --> 09:38.031
That's not cool at all.

09:39.966 --> 09:41.022
You got more stuff?

09:41.027 --> 09:44.550
Mmh, just a carful of boxes
containing all my worldly possessions.

09:44.555 --> 09:46.083
- Want some help?
- Yes!

09:46.866 --> 09:47.640
Over here.

09:48.397 --> 09:51.443
Yeah, this fine example of american
automotive engineering is mine.

09:55.867 --> 09:56.721
Oh, my god.

09:57.358 --> 09:58.292
Where's all your stuff?

09:59.538 --> 10:02.632
It's all gone. Everything I own.
It was here five minutes ago.

10:03.187 --> 10:04.023
Now it's gone.

10:05.376 --> 10:07.183
I know someone.
She'll get your stuff back.

10:08.977 --> 10:10.111
Count on it.

10:12.737 --> 10:16.072
This girl, she's our age,
and she's a "detective"?

10:16.838 --> 10:18.043
She also a cartoon?

10:18.196 --> 10:20.382
Look, she doesn't carry
a magnifying glass or anything.

10:20.668 --> 10:22.701
Her dad's a P.I. Used to be sheriff.

10:22.787 --> 10:24.173
Phew, she's picked up a few things.

10:24.305 --> 10:25.661
Look, I appreciate the thought, man.

10:25.767 --> 10:28.281
But I'll just let
the local police handle it.

10:28.286 --> 10:29.512
Yeah, good luck with that.

10:34.318 --> 10:36.051
Hi, I'm Veronica. Are you Piz?

10:36.055 --> 10:37.640
Yes,  I'm Piz.

10:41.968 --> 10:44.110
Wallace? Are you in there somewhere?

10:44.115 --> 10:45.542
Yeah, come in.

10:48.818 --> 10:50.743
And you call yourself college men.

10:51.138 --> 10:53.860
Where are the posters with beer
and half-naked ladies?

10:53.916 --> 10:56.200
It's behind the porn
and my shot-glass collection.

10:56.888 --> 11:00.122
So, looks like Piz is just gonna
let the sheriff handle things.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.640
Actually, I'd love your help.

11:04.386 --> 11:07.850
As to my fee, $500, payable in cash,
cashier's check,

11:07.855 --> 11:10.593
or a pre-agreed-upon exchange
of goods or services.

11:10.598 --> 11:11.932
I could give you guitar lessons.

11:12.488 --> 11:13.283
Pass.

11:13.505 --> 11:16.510
On the bright side, if I don't get your
stuff back, you owe me nothing.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.010
That's the friend-of-a-friend rate.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.442
Wait. I haven't even decided
if he's cool yet.

11:21.665 --> 11:24.420
Act now. Time is running out
on this special offer.

11:26.717 --> 11:28.320
So, I pulled into the parking lot,

11:28.408 --> 11:32.132
and there was this...
heavyset girl with a clipboard.

11:32.138 --> 11:34.232
She had a Hearst sweatshirt and cap on.

11:34.317 --> 11:36.720
She checked my name off a list,
told me which dorm was mine,

11:36.738 --> 11:38.912

while I went and found my room.

11:41.846 --> 11:43.482
Yeah, I guess.

11:43.967 --> 11:45.990
Said she was part of
the Hearst welcome-wagon committee.

your computer, a guitar...

11:50.697 --> 11:52.141
No, not just a guitar.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.970
It was a 1967 gretsch astrojet red-top.

11:56.496 --> 11:57.482
It's like the holy grail of guitars.

11:57.485 --> 12:00.041
Okay, I spent two summers mowing lawns
to earn enough to buy it.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.700
This is it.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.950

and covered your car with dirt?

12:05.756 --> 12:07.040
You're not welcome here.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.841

said she'd watch my car.

12:28.426 --> 12:30.632
This is how you know you've gone
from high school to college...

12:30.898 --> 12:32.471

12:32.876 --> 12:34.792

12:49.287 --> 12:52.040
No "Battlestar Galactica" fans
in the mix, I see?

12:53.107 --> 12:55.102
"Frak" is the profanity of the future.

12:55.418 --> 12:56.511

12:56.916 --> 12:58.591
That's very enlightened of you, moe.

12:59.057 --> 13:02.081
So, what the frak is with this Hearst
welcome-wagon committee?

13:02.145 --> 13:04.122
Well, first off, there's no such thing,

Awesome. The dorm wings are same-sex.

was over the size of that cut.

23:22.846 --> 23:25.512
My friend is offering $100 reward

23:25.518 --> 23:27.672
for information that'll help him
get his stuff back.

23:27.847 --> 23:30.270
We're back at that table
if you know something.

23:31.755 --> 23:33.032
Okay.

23:33.487 --> 23:35.732
Look at her. She's like boy-nip.

23:37.025 --> 23:38.353
We saw you get ripped off.

23:39.235 --> 23:40.453
You're 12.

23:40.485 --> 23:42.201
What were you doing up at Hearst?

23:42.387 --> 23:44.342
Checking out
the college girls laying out.

23:45.205 --> 23:46.522
Some of them go topless.

23:46.528 --> 23:48.972
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up right there, son.

23:49.008 --> 23:51.082
Tell us where this sunbathing goes on.

23:51.167 --> 23:53.503
South quad where that statue is.

23:53.585 --> 23:54.870
What are you saying you saw?

23:54.956 --> 23:57.711
Is it the Randolph Hearst statue
or the amorphous blobby thing?

23:57.766 --> 24:00.551
Breasts or the holy grail guitar.

24:00.608 --> 24:02.333
We was coming back
through the parking lot.

24:02.336 --> 24:04.660
We saw these two dudes
in a moving van pull up by this car.

24:04.706 --> 24:07.461
They started throwing stuff
into the van in a major hurry.

24:07.535 --> 24:10.650
Anything you remember
about the two dudes or the van?

24:10.838 --> 24:12.641
- They were black dudes.
- Of course they were.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.932
And the van didn't have any windows.
It was white, I think.

24:16.027 --> 24:16.813
Is that all?

24:16.885 --> 24:18.902
That's a lot. Where's our reward?

24:19.016 --> 24:21.203
You didn't see squat. Motor, munchkins.

24:21.425 --> 24:23.613
I told you, man. Bogus.

24:27.086 --> 24:28.923
There was a chick there. A white chick.

24:28.965 --> 24:29.940
Of course there was.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.673
She hopped up in the cab with them.

24:31.888 --> 24:33.471
A blonde? Chubby?

24:33.477 --> 24:35.031
Nah, that was the weird part.

24:35.437 --> 24:37.042
I thought she was a heifer at first.

24:37.218 --> 24:39.222
When she hopped in,
she pulled off her sweatshirt.

24:39.667 --> 24:40.953
She had a slammin' bod.

24:41.386 --> 24:43.741
Girl was packed tight,
like she was wearing a fat suit.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.362
Come on, parker.

24:51.718 --> 24:53.692
Why do you want to be like that, girl?

24:54.286 --> 24:56.553
It's the right time of the night.

24:57.356 --> 25:02.323
It's the right time of the night...
for makin' love.

25:05.756 --> 25:07.861
Parker's out somewhere
with the Unwashed.

25:07.866 --> 25:10.733
I'll tell her that the
needs-hosed-down dropped by.

25:12.905 --> 25:15.183
My little brother
never cared about you, you know?

25:16.295 --> 25:17.493
You were just his beard.

25:18.796 --> 25:20.172
Hey, you!

25:20.736 --> 25:22.753
What's your name?
You're not supposed to be here.

25:22.816 --> 25:25.912
Isn't this the boys' floor?
Oh, gosh, I am so lost.

25:26.297 --> 25:28.840
I'm just a dumb freshman
who wandered onto the wrong floor.

25:29.336 --> 25:31.822
Wow, campus is so confusing.

25:32.346 --> 25:34.862
Thanks for your understanding.
I'm just gonna show myself out.

25:34.936 --> 25:36.811
Let me see your school I.D.

25:38.008 --> 25:41.260
We're supposed to have I.D.s?
See, I don't know anything.

25:41.758 --> 25:44.011
College has got me plumb flustered.

25:45.567 --> 25:47.291
Good night, ladies.

26:01.846 --> 26:04.392
Hey. These are for you.

26:04.907 --> 26:06.821
Clothes. A friend of mine's.

26:06.956 --> 26:09.970
He can't use them anymore.
You look about the same size.

26:10.588 --> 26:11.810
Thanks.

26:12.185 --> 26:13.552
Oh, and I think I found your guitar.

26:13.948 --> 26:15.661
It popped up on craigslist
late last night,

26:15.747 --> 26:17.640
and the seller is just off campus.

26:29.616 --> 26:31.562
- You here about the guitar?
- That's us.

26:35.037 --> 26:36.683
I wasn't really looking for a guitar,

26:36.687 --> 26:39.832
but I went to the flea market
yesterday, and I found this.

26:40.606 --> 26:43.612
Girl was selling it for $500.
She had no idea what she had.

26:43.616 --> 26:45.882
You won't find one of these
for under 5 grand.

26:46.065 --> 26:48.742
But I'd be willing
to let it go for $4,000.

26:50.427 --> 26:51.673
That's it. That's my stolen guitar.

26:52.908 --> 26:54.411
- What?
- Go ahead, look in the pick tray.

26:54.805 --> 26:56.880
There'll be two milimeter picks
from Guitar Town in Portland.

27:02.858 --> 27:04.531
Okay, yeah, so?

27:04.557 --> 27:07.453
This girl who sold you the guitar,
can you describe her?

27:07.476 --> 27:09.792
Blond, thin, pretty smokin' bod.

27:14.036 --> 27:16.801
Donald Fagan, the current possessor
of Piz's guitar,

27:16.845 --> 27:20.000
offered to sell it back to Piz
for the $500 he paid for it.

27:20.218 --> 27:22.972
A better plan I think,
is to make the thief pay for it.

27:26.468 --> 27:27.300
Smile.

27:28.297 --> 27:29.340
Thanks.

27:29.465 --> 27:30.980
Hey, wait a minute.

27:47.918 --> 27:49.162
You guys are pathetic.

27:50.308 --> 27:51.550
It's a white man's sport.

27:51.695 --> 27:53.563
Right, 'cause I was talking
about the hacky sack.

27:55.075 --> 27:57.752
Piz, is this the welcome-wagon girl?

27:59.387 --> 28:02.423
Uh, hard to say. Maybe.

28:02.425 --> 28:03.943
Add a few extra pounds.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.441
Yeah, I'm trying to.

28:07.626 --> 28:08.821
I don't think it's her.

28:13.006 --> 28:14.990
It's not often
you get to see bikini babes

28:14.995 --> 28:16.620
in their natural habitat.

28:17.296 --> 28:20.202
Such gentle yet elusive creatures.

28:23.477 --> 28:25.361
Okay, you two have fun being gross.

28:25.367 --> 28:28.463
I'll just continue trying to find
your stuff on my own...

28:29.015 --> 28:30.192
with no help.

28:30.955 --> 28:32.950
That's why you make the big money.

28:39.505 --> 28:40.491
No signal.

28:41.627 --> 28:43.410
And not one car for 10 minutes.

28:45.247 --> 28:46.952
Highway turns back in a few miles.

28:47.988 --> 28:49.983
Looks like if we just walk due east,

28:50.105 --> 28:52.271
we'd see the town of granger
in three or four miles.

28:52.627 --> 28:54.091
I don't think we want to do that.

28:54.477 --> 28:56.263
You spent much time
in the desert, Keith?

28:57.368 --> 28:59.453
No, can't say that I have.

29:00.227 --> 29:03.423
First time I got busted,
judge gave me the option...

29:03.456 --> 29:05.340
two years in the army
or two years in huntsville.

29:05.627 --> 29:07.071
I chose the army.

29:07.077 --> 29:08.812
We did our training in west Texas

29:08.816 --> 29:11.052
before they sent me
to Iraq for Desert Storm.

29:12.138 --> 29:15.701
Between here and granger,
you got rattlesnakes,

29:15.785 --> 29:18.380
coyote traps, scorpions,

29:18.385 --> 29:20.940
hippies doing mushrooms,
all kinds of bad stuff.

29:21.815 --> 29:24.130
You know, let's...
Let's just wait it out.

29:24.467 --> 29:25.990
Someone will help us.

29:26.635 --> 29:30.401
I bided my time for five years.
What's a few more hours?

29:34.177 --> 29:35.362
Is it her?

29:35.535 --> 29:37.080
I'm 90% sure that's her.

29:37.277 --> 29:40.090
But... look, you know what,
make it 80%.

29:40.155 --> 29:41.271
80% sure.

29:44.135 --> 29:46.570
Hey, are you in
Landry's profiling class?

29:47.735 --> 29:50.000
Last year. Man's tough.

29:50.235 --> 29:51.873
I have him for intro to criminology.

29:52.155 --> 29:54.811
Did you do the mentoring thing?
Cause I'm thinking about it.

29:54.816 --> 29:57.192
Best thing as an undergrad,
working with those kids.

29:57.347 --> 29:59.543
You can read about
street crime in a textbook,

29:59.546 --> 30:02.552
but mentoring takes everything
out of the theoretical, really grounds.

30:02.586 --> 30:03.662
You should sign up.

30:04.667 --> 30:07.023
Oh, my god.
You can settle a debate for me.

30:08.616 --> 30:10.200
Is this on the Empire State building

30:10.205 --> 30:11.493
or the Chrysler building?

30:11.665 --> 30:14.272
That's actually
the Space Needle in Seattle.

30:14.615 --> 30:18.011
I have to remember not to debate my dad
when it comes to architecture.

30:19.236 --> 30:20.243
Can I have a glass of water?

30:20.436 --> 30:21.320
Sure.

30:23.766 --> 30:26.290
So, by the time you finish
your reading this weekend,

30:26.298 --> 30:28.693
you should be able to discuss
crime and social control

30:28.696 --> 30:31.613
in relation to biological
and psychological positivism.

30:32.435 --> 30:33.461
See you tuesday.

30:41.176 --> 30:42.203
Excuse me.

30:43.035 --> 30:45.002
I was interested
in the mentoring program.

30:45.068 --> 30:46.442
You're the guy to talk to, right?

30:48.106 --> 30:49.421
You can take your pick.

30:49.876 --> 30:51.432
All of them have juvenile records.

30:51.435 --> 30:54.540
Most of the girls, it's shoplifting,
fighting, chronic truancy.

30:54.565 --> 30:57.380
Wait, just because I'm a girl
means I have to mentor a girl?

30:57.806 --> 30:58.503
Yes.

30:58.775 --> 31:01.291
That's in case they get
their period or something, right?

31:02.297 --> 31:03.251
You Tim?

31:03.316 --> 31:04.233
Who are you?

31:04.237 --> 31:06.240
Dr. Landry needs you back
in the lecture hall.

31:06.655 --> 31:07.530
I'll wait.

31:33.738 --> 31:35.040
Tow truck's here.

31:39.068 --> 31:40.912
Wallace says you're
in his sociology class.

31:41.077 --> 31:42.990
Really? I haven't seen him.

31:43.837 --> 31:45.820
Maybe because
you haven't shown up for class.

31:46.668 --> 31:48.431
Well, that's certainly one possibility.

31:51.558 --> 31:54.313
Here. A bonus birthday gift.

31:54.318 --> 31:57.062
You got me a bow? A bow?!

31:57.496 --> 31:58.523
How did you guess?!

31:58.746 --> 32:00.082
Open it, smarty-pants.

32:05.247 --> 32:06.103
Your room key?

32:07.696 --> 32:09.700
What if I drop in unexpectedly?

32:09.978 --> 32:11.483
The other girls will have to...

32:11.837 --> 32:14.701
I bet you know there's no one else.
I only want you.

32:19.178 --> 32:20.623
You ought to know that by now.

32:23.618 --> 32:24.490
What then, no quip?

32:27.357 --> 32:28.413
Look.

32:30.175 --> 32:32.140
It's your B.F.F., the town drunk.

32:32.568 --> 32:35.581
Hi, my name's Dick. What's yours?

32:36.455 --> 32:37.312
Deedee.

32:38.625 --> 32:40.043
How long have we known
each other, Deedee?

32:40.808 --> 32:42.650
Eight seconds.

32:43.548 --> 32:45.381
So, where's this going, Deedee?

32:45.817 --> 32:47.000
Is this thing we feel real?

32:47.237 --> 32:49.192
Or are we just in it
for the torso butter?

32:50.855 --> 32:53.350
Truth is, I've been kicked out
of on-campus housing

32:54.286 --> 32:57.000
and I know, timing's a little sooner
than we hoped for,

32:57.046 --> 32:59.580
but... what do you say
we move in together,

32:59.806 --> 33:01.120
make our own love nest?

33:01.646 --> 33:03.772
You should really walk away.

33:04.127 --> 33:05.611
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

33:05.858 --> 33:08.061
I'll admit, the kid looks good
walking away.

33:08.277 --> 33:09.570
It's all me, too.

33:09.656 --> 33:11.961
Ass like Marky Mark
and the entire funky bunch.

33:14.148 --> 33:15.092
Your bag?

33:32.746 --> 33:34.371
What, do you want a hug or something?

33:38.356 --> 33:40.340
Does that sort of thing work
with college girls?

33:40.836 --> 33:43.261
'Cause I'll tell you up front,
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

33:43.637 --> 33:45.030
I'm gonna try to talk to him.

33:51.126 --> 33:52.391
Nice shirt.

33:54.425 --> 33:56.213
- You wanted me to meet you here?
- Yeah.

34:00.687 --> 34:03.541
- Is this the welcome-wagon girl?
- Yeah it's her.

34:08.755 --> 34:10.821
The girl in the photo
is the welcome-wagon girl.

34:11.068 --> 34:12.380
The guy is the ringleader.

34:12.496 --> 34:13.639
And you're sure that's her?

34:13.795 --> 34:14.630
That's her.

34:14.828 --> 34:16.322
His name is Donald Fagan,

34:16.534 --> 34:19.692
and these three charming lads
are the kids he mentors...

34:20.147 --> 34:21.739
Thieves, all of them.

34:26.476 --> 34:28.512
Okay, so why would those kids
at the club talk to us

34:28.585 --> 34:29.862
if they knew they'd stolen my stuff?

34:31.085 --> 34:32.793
So they could steer us
in the wrong direction?

34:33.507 --> 34:35.420
Then they just repeated
the story to their mentor

34:35.764 --> 34:36.791
so the stories would match.

34:37.788 --> 34:39.702
So you do realize there's not a lot
of college freshmen girls

34:39.764 --> 34:43.250
who do this sort of thing...
You know, solve crimes.

34:43.257 --> 34:44.281
There aren't?

34:44.286 --> 34:45.400
So, why do you do it?

34:48.217 --> 34:50.272
- Cold, hard cash?
- Seriously.

34:52.158 --> 34:53.152
Uh...

34:53.176 --> 34:55.942
Wallace told me about your friend...
who was murdered.

34:58.908 --> 35:00.911
Because I'm good at it, maybe?
I don't know.

35:02.365 --> 35:04.303
Wallace should stick
to analyzing himself.

35:07.325 --> 35:09.191
This is not right.
This is absolutely not right.

35:10.305 --> 35:12.083
You want to know why I do it?

35:12.088 --> 35:14.552
Here it comes. This is the good part.

35:14.565 --> 35:16.433
And take my things from me and then...

35:21.326 --> 35:23.093
I might actually get my stuff back.

35:23.098 --> 35:24.942
I might actually get paid.

35:31.676 --> 35:33.022
Boom goes the dynamite.

35:33.338 --> 35:34.370
Heh.

35:37.715 --> 35:39.423
So, is that guy from last night
your boyfriend?

35:53.095 --> 35:54.331
There she is.

35:55.925 --> 35:57.943
You ever have a woman
who loved you so much

35:58.027 --> 35:59.242
she'd do time for you?

36:02.988 --> 36:04.071
Baby!

36:05.028 --> 36:06.000
Whoo!

36:08.275 --> 36:09.321
Whoa!

36:12.686 --> 36:14.023
I figured out the knocking thing.

36:14.086 --> 36:15.542
You could have waited in your room.

36:16.158 --> 36:17.750
Parker's in there with some guy.

36:18.677 --> 36:19.700
Well, let's head out.

36:19.855 --> 36:21.703
The midnight movie waits for no man.

36:22.315 --> 36:24.401
Our tickets are in there
stuck in the mirror...

36:24.635 --> 36:26.581
above her suggestion box and tip jar.

36:27.905 --> 36:29.220
Well, frak.

36:30.475 --> 36:31.771
Give me your keys.

36:42.145 --> 36:46.633
<i>You're listening to Clamp Flush
on KR FM, Hearst College radio.</i>

36:48.247 --> 36:49.662
Don't mind me.

36:52.467 --> 36:54.291
That's excellent cake, Kendall.

36:54.395 --> 36:56.520
Well, I'll tell Sara Lee you approve.

36:57.235 --> 36:59.600
We decided where
we're going to run off to, Keith.

36:59.606 --> 37:00.531
Don't want to know.

37:00.538 --> 37:03.071
It's got sand and water.

37:03.116 --> 37:04.101
Stop.

37:05.737 --> 37:08.523
But that reminds me, I've got
Cormac's travel documents in the car.

37:08.835 --> 37:11.261
I'll just grab them and get out of
here, give you kids some private time.

37:11.437 --> 37:14.360
Hurry, Keith. We might not be able
to contain ourselves.

37:42.186 --> 37:44.952
Oh, no, Vinnie. Please tell me
you're not working for Liam.

38:03.835 --> 38:04.732
Kendall!

38:20.688 --> 38:22.600
Awfully cold night, Keith.

38:29.035 --> 38:31.512
I'll come and pick up
your carcass in the morning.

38:33.265 --> 38:36.320
Guess Kendall wasn't that great
a judge of character after all.

39:11.996 --> 39:13.351
I don't have anywhere else to go.

39:15.856 --> 39:18.760
Hey, it's all right. You can stay here.

39:29.405 --> 39:30.563
I messed up bad.

39:34.265 --> 39:35.541
It's gonna be okay.

39:41.586 --> 39:42.661
Come here.

39:46.845 --> 39:47.993
You worked in a coffee shop.

39:47.997 --> 39:50.681
How can you not know an Irish coffee
has whiskey in it?

39:51.575 --> 39:52.523
At java the hut,

39:52.665 --> 39:56.673
It meant a latte with a little shot
of Irish cream syrup.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.823
That explains
the first one you ordered.

39:59.126 --> 40:00.840
They were magically delicious.

40:00.967 --> 40:03.313
And they served me. Boo-yah!

40:03.666 --> 40:07.393
Yeah. "Boo-yah"? You probably
shouldn't drive home.

40:07.396 --> 40:08.443
I'm fine.

40:10.045 --> 40:11.261
Okay, maybe not.

40:14.008 --> 40:16.662
And we're dude-free. Couch is yours.

40:38.386 --> 40:41.983
