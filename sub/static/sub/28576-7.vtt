WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.600
[Harrow] Previously,
onHarrow...

00:07.640 --> 00:09.280
[Fern] Dad thought
it was all connected.

00:09.320 --> 00:12.040
The chemist must know
something. I'm gonna
go talk to him.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.360
You planted that Fentanyl
in my apartment.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.480
I had no idea what he was
gonna do with those drugs!

00:16.520 --> 00:18.520
-Who did this to me?!
-The les you know the better!

00:18.560 --> 00:21.400
-Now go!
-[Pavich] Laurie Badcoe
conducted the PM

00:21.440 --> 00:22.720
on Francis Chester.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.800
Is it possible he found
a way out of that prison?

00:25.840 --> 00:28.440
[Laurie] That dangerous
creature died in captivity.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.400
You put people
second to the job, and
they end up getting hurt.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.400
[Harrow] Simon was
obsessing over my case.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.080
I'll never forgive myself
for what happened.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.640
How many people have you
told about Chester?
Let it go, Daniel.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.200
Before somebody else gets hurt.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.360
Please, Francis, no!

00:43.400 --> 00:46.360
No! No!

00:51.560 --> 00:55.120
The doctors told me
my tumours were inoperable.

00:55.160 --> 00:58.360
They said... there was no hope.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.320
But I refused to give up.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.319
MFL.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.240
Minerals For Living.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.800
Conventional medicine
couldn't save me,

01:08.840 --> 01:10.200
but alternative medicine has.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.240
Hey, Taylor, it's just me.

01:13.280 --> 01:18.160
You can turn your back
on cancer medicine
that doesn't work...

01:18.200 --> 01:20.120
[Taylor continues, indistinct]

01:23.200 --> 01:25.480
Take control.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.960
Start getting your life back.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.240
[panting]

02:17.640 --> 02:20.920
She was in my office,
on my computer,
looking up autopsy files.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.120
-[Steph] Well, I don't know why!
She didn't come home-
-Sorry about that!

02:24.160 --> 02:25.280
Where were you?

02:25.320 --> 02:27.880
-[Fern] Shit.
-[Steph] Fern? What's going on?

02:27.920 --> 02:30.520
Dad, someone's behind all this.
You were right all along.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.160
-What do you mean?
-[pounding on door]

02:32.200 --> 02:34.480
-[Jill] Police. Open up.
-I went and talked to Markides,
the chemist.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.880
And he basically admitted
that he set me up.

02:36.920 --> 02:39.440
-Fern, you're not
allowed near him!
-[Jill] Ms Tolson, let us in.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.320
Markides owned a horse
with Ross Moran, who's dead.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.520
Simon went and visited
Ross Moran, and now
he's dead, too.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.840
-[Steph] Okay. Okay!
-Dad, it's all connected.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.240
Fern Harrow, you're under
arrest for Arson

02:51.280 --> 02:53.760
resulting in the death
of Timothy Markides.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.600
Think very carefully
about what you say.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.880
The neighbour has your daughter
coming out of Markides' house

02:59.920 --> 03:01.520
just before it went up
in flames.

03:01.560 --> 03:04.160
This is bullshit.
Fern is not a murderer.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.720
Just like
she's not a drug dealer?

03:05.760 --> 03:07.920
Dad, I didn't do it.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.480
You need to tell me
what's going on.

03:17.840 --> 03:20.040
So when it seemed Simon's
death was an accident,

03:20.080 --> 03:23.240
I started to doubt
everything else.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.640
But Fern didn't.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.240
She kept looking.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.280
And this person you say
is behind all this,

03:30.320 --> 03:32.000
you're saying
he escaped from gaol?

03:32.040 --> 03:34.280
So, how do we know that Fern's
gonna be safe in prison?

03:34.320 --> 03:36.680
She'll be in
a women's remand centre.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.320
The new inmates will be
watched closely.

03:38.360 --> 03:39.760
And what about you or me?

03:39.800 --> 03:41.680
I mean, are we in danger?
You were shot, for God's sake.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.040
I think you should stay
somewhere else for a while.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.720
And we need to talk
to Callan too.

03:46.760 --> 03:50.120
I mean, we've been trying
to keep her out of gaol
this whole time.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.120
And now what? She could be
facing murder charges?!

03:52.160 --> 03:54.080
I mean, we can't just
leave her in there!

03:54.120 --> 03:56.000
We won't.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.600
I just need to prove
that I'm right.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.640
How?

04:00.680 --> 04:03.600
[Pavich] An exhumation order?
No, absolutely not.

04:03.640 --> 04:07.760
It's the only way to prove
that autopsy was wrong
and Chester is alive.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.600
Hang on, I thought you'd
put this to bed.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.760
What has changed?

04:10.800 --> 04:13.120
Fern's been arrested for arson.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.320
What? Arson?

04:17.200 --> 04:20.720
Markides? The body that's
on its way here now?

04:20.760 --> 04:24.480
Maxine, you've known her
since she was a baby.
She didn't do this.

04:24.520 --> 04:29.720
Okay, look, Daniel,
if I thought for one second
Chester was alive,

04:29.760 --> 04:32.960
I would sign an exhumation
request on the spot.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.760
But I cannot get past
a post mortem

04:35.800 --> 04:38.160
performed by one of the state's
most respected pathologists.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.240
-Laurie Badcoe.
-Who was once your
supervisor and mine.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.520
Do you really think he
would've got it wrong?

04:43.560 --> 04:46.000
And even if I did
put a formal request in,

04:46.040 --> 04:47.800
do you think
the Deputy Coroner
would agree?

04:50.360 --> 04:51.640
[bell rings]

04:52.840 --> 04:54.880
-That Markides' body now?
-Yeah--

04:54.920 --> 04:56.280
Daniel!

04:57.600 --> 04:58.840
Harrow...

05:00.280 --> 05:02.080
Don't get any ideas.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.080
I have assigned
this one to--

05:04.120 --> 05:07.600
Harrow, the cleaners are
complaining about you again.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.040
-Why?
-You won't let them
into your office.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.080
That's because they
throw away important things.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.520
What, like germ theory?

05:13.560 --> 05:15.480
Like my last coffee mug.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.480
[Fairley] Which hadn't been
washed since the Boer War.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.600
I gave it a rinse...
in the late 90s.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.440
-[woman] Lyle. Okay.
-[Fairley] Okay.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.680
Maybe you should
take a few days.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.800
God knows you've got
about three years owing.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.360
No.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.000
There's nothing I can do
until Fern faces court again.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.600
Maybe it will help if I
stay and focus on work.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.080
Good. You can join Grace.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.480
She's with Bryan
at a crime scene.

05:40.280 --> 05:43.040
Let Fairley do this.

05:43.080 --> 05:46.880
If there's anything to be found,
he'll find it.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.040
And if there's a link
to Chester,

05:49.080 --> 05:51.840
I promise I will sign
an exhumation request.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.640
[Fairley] That's done.
Enjoy your long weekend.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.920
-[man] I will.
-[Fairley] take him to
exam room two.

06:02.200 --> 06:06.080
Lyle, I need you to check
the victim for succinylcholine.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.360
-Why would I do that?
-Because I'm asking,

06:08.400 --> 06:10.040
and I'm desperate.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.200
And I never once told anyone
about that time you took
hula hoop classes.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.040
They were excellent
for my lower spine.

06:17.640 --> 06:18.960
Believe in yourself, yeah?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.680
Believe in what
your body is telling you.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.440
You can do what I've done.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.840
You can turn your back
on cancer medicine

06:25.880 --> 06:27.600
that doesn't work.

06:30.760 --> 06:34.000
Okay, so I'm going to
need you to take me
through everything once more.

06:35.880 --> 06:36.880
How's Fern?

06:39.240 --> 06:42.000
Homicide have been asked
to prepare a preliminary brief.

06:43.480 --> 06:47.520
Hey, look, I know you, I know
Fern, but think how this looks.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.480
Fern would never do
something like that.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.640
Well, who did?

06:53.520 --> 06:55.280
Dead men don't
tend to light fires.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.080
She's in gaol, Bryan.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.280
I've got to prove that
Chester is still alive.

07:00.320 --> 07:04.280
Okay, well I'm sorry
to have to say this, mate,
but you'd better do it fast.

07:04.320 --> 07:08.120
Because if that fire
wasn't an accident,
Fern's got no chance of bail.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.200
She'll be in prison
for a very long time.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.880
[camera shutter snaps]

07:25.560 --> 07:28.720
-[Harrow sighs]
-Did Maxine send a babysitter?

07:28.760 --> 07:32.360
-I think I'm the one
she wants babysat.
-Makes sense to me.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.960
So, what happened here,
apart from the obvious?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.320
[Nichols] This is Taylor Ford.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.920
And I should know
that name because...?

07:42.960 --> 07:45.400
She's very big in
the alternate therapy world.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.880
Cancer cures, morning TV,
the podcasts.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.320
Nearly two million followers.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.800
My interests are broader than
what you give me credit for.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.720
Significant cranial trauma.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.600
Yeah...

08:03.640 --> 08:06.520
Looks like she fell,
landed here,

08:06.560 --> 08:07.920
never regained consciousness.

08:07.960 --> 08:11.120
Shame, after all
she's been through.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.960
It's awful, but, uh...
what's the big mystery?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.960
Well, actually,
there is no mystery.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.200
A courier comes in,

08:18.240 --> 08:20.120
sees a bloke
bent over the body.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.600
He does a runner.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.160
We pick him up.

08:24.440 --> 08:25.920
Connor Harris.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.520
Active on Taylor's website.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.840
Active?

08:28.880 --> 08:31.160
Hate mail and death threats.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.559
Why?

08:34.280 --> 08:38.080
Because his girlfriend...
is dying.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.240
Stage 4 breast cancer.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.360
He blames Taylor here
for his girlfriend turning her
back on conventional medicine.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.160
And I presume he claims
he found her this way.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.520
Yeah, but can't explain
what he was doing here
in the first place.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.160
So, he pushed her?

08:51.200 --> 08:53.560
And that, my friends,
is the question.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.000
Did she fall...
or was she pushed?

09:05.080 --> 09:08.720
...for taking this incredible
journey with me, and I'll
see you guys next time.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.840
[Nichols] That's Taylor's
home studio.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.160
Did her video blogs from there.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.000
[Harrow] Hmm...

09:16.040 --> 09:18.960
They said... there was no hope.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.840
But I refused to give up.

09:21.880 --> 09:25.800
MFL, Minerals For Living.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.760
[woman screams] No!

09:30.320 --> 09:32.560
[woman] Step back. It's fine.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.320
-No!
-Just breathe.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.560
-Who's that?
-That must be her manager.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.720
[sobbing]

09:55.960 --> 09:59.280
I heard about Fern
and the chemist.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.520
Is she okay?

10:02.960 --> 10:06.120
I don't know.
They won't let me talk to her.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.640
Do you want
to talk about it?

10:07.680 --> 10:09.480
[sighs]

10:09.520 --> 10:11.480
Not right now,
if that's okay.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.160
Yeah.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.240
The chemist?!
Man, I told her not to go there!

10:37.280 --> 10:39.480
Why doesn't she ever
listen to me?

10:39.520 --> 10:41.880
She knew she wasn't supposed
to approach Markides.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.360
I mean, why would she--

10:43.400 --> 10:45.840
Why would she break
her bail conditions
and risk everything?

10:45.880 --> 10:49.720
Because no-one believed that
she didn't steal the drugs.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.400
Not even you believed us.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.360
I'm sorry.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.760
Look, so, where is she?

10:59.800 --> 11:01.040
Huh?

11:01.080 --> 11:02.800
Will I still be able
to see her at least?

11:02.840 --> 11:06.200
She's in remand.
None of us can see her.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.080
-Until when?
-I don't know, Callan.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.280
Until we get this whole thing
sorted out.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.480
-[frustrated sigh, then groan]
-[Steph] Look...

11:12.520 --> 11:15.400
Dan told me that he thinks
that there's someone
behind all of this.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.200
It's a pretty complex theory,
but what do you think?

11:18.240 --> 11:20.560
-Is it possible?
-I don't know.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.120
But I trust Fern,
and I trust her dad.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.040
-So, if they that's
what they think...
-Okay, well,

11:27.080 --> 11:29.720
until Dan sorts this all out,
I'm going to stay in a hotel
for a few days.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.720
And you need to be
careful too, okay?

11:31.760 --> 11:33.120
-Yeah.
-I can give you a lift to work.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.960
No, it's fine. I got a mate
picking me up, okay.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.120
Stay safe.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.360
Everything okay?

11:51.600 --> 11:54.120
-Not really.
-Oh?

11:54.160 --> 11:56.480
-[Callan] My girlfriend's
been arrested.
-[Steph's engine starts]

11:56.520 --> 11:59.160
Oh, mate, that's no good.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.720
Should we head to work?

12:07.360 --> 12:08.840
Yeah, mate.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.160
[Harrow] Low body weight
for her age.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.600
What sort of cancer
did she have?

12:21.640 --> 12:24.400
Brain tumour.
Haemangioblastoma.

12:25.760 --> 12:28.200
Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome?

12:28.240 --> 12:30.400
What do you make of this?

12:30.440 --> 12:33.480
The whites are quite yellow.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.840
Yeah, could be
the effects of cancer
or the effects of chemo.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.960
She wasn't on chemo.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.240
Apparently, she just ate fruit,
vegetables and that supplement.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.280
[Harrow] Oh. We'll need to get
those ingredients tested.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.280
Mmm.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.040
Petechial haemorrhaging.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.440
It could be as a result
of body placement.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.200
Was her head below her body
when the police got there?

12:53.240 --> 12:56.680
Yes, but not long enough for
that kind of vessel damage.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.800
[Harrow] Asphyxiation?

12:58.840 --> 13:00.520
Perhaps her throat
is obstructed.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.240
Jaw intact, no external
sign of being choked.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.480
-[machine powers up]
-[computer beeps]

13:12.760 --> 13:14.440
The lining is burnt.

13:14.480 --> 13:18.600
Yeah. That scar tissue is from
frequent and violent vomiting.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.120
[Grace] I've seen that
in bulimia sufferers.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.440
-And her teeth are damaged.
-Mmm.

13:22.480 --> 13:28.320
Stomach acid.
Taylor was one very sick girl.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.520
That explains
the haemorrhaging.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.640
But it doesn't tell us
if she was murdered.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.400
Let's see what
her internals tell us.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.960
I've seen better livers
in 50-year-old alcoholics.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.800
Hmm? [chuckles]

13:49.840 --> 13:51.680
I'm not 50.

13:51.720 --> 13:55.280
And my liver might have
a few dents, but not like this.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.760
Brain matter's healthy.
What's the state
of the rest of her organs?

13:59.800 --> 14:02.320
[exhales] Also impaired.

14:02.360 --> 14:05.040
Her kidneys were
barely functioning.

14:05.080 --> 14:08.200
Now, Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome
shouldn't cause
this sort of damage

14:08.240 --> 14:10.240
in the rest of her body,
should it?

14:10.280 --> 14:11.920
She might have had tumours
in her organs,

14:11.960 --> 14:13.760
but her organs themselves
shouldn't be damaged.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.960
How's her brain?

14:18.440 --> 14:20.640
Well, this is the injury
from her fall.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.720
There's certainly
a brain injury.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.520
You can see the contusions
and a bit of localised bleeding.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.080
But it's not
necessarily fatal.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.200
Well, something was fatal.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.520
Going back to the cancer,

14:33.560 --> 14:36.280
what if the tumour
was impacting an artery?

14:36.320 --> 14:39.400
She might have lost balance
and fallen down the stairs.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.320
No. There is no brain tumour.

14:42.360 --> 14:45.080
The contusion
is all that's here.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.920
With VHL syndrome, there should
be seeing tumours in her brain,

14:47.960 --> 14:50.200
on her spine, even her eye.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.000
-Nothing.
-So, her alternative
therapy worked?

14:53.040 --> 14:54.480
It didn't need to.

14:54.520 --> 14:58.680
There's no evidence Taylor
ever had a brain tumour.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.080
So, what are we
dealing with here?

15:03.120 --> 15:05.960
One of those Fake Cancer
video bloggers?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.560
Looks like it.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.960
She looked sick.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.360
More likely from the so-called
"health supplement"

15:11.400 --> 15:14.240
she was ingesting to treat
the cancer she never had.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.240
We're getting a full analysis
done of the product,

15:16.280 --> 15:19.360
but preliminary testing's
showing mercury,
other heavy metals...

15:19.400 --> 15:21.360
Mercury? God, even I know
that's crook.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.440
That's why I gave up
eating fish and chips.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.440
Not because Maxine
wanted less to hug?

15:27.720 --> 15:31.400
Look, I've got a bloke standing
over the top of her body
who sent her death threats.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.920
Did Connor Harris
kill her or not?

15:32.960 --> 15:36.040
It's possible his story holds
up, that he found her fallen.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.040
We won't know more
until tox comes back.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.240
Less to hug.

15:46.280 --> 15:50.280
I'd like to know
how Taylor ever got a cancer
diagnosis in the first place.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.640
[woman] Yes, I treated her.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.800
She presented three years ago.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.560
Dizziness, headaches.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.720
She was terrified that
she had a brain tumour.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.520
Why would she think that?

16:04.560 --> 16:07.760
Both her mother
and her brother died from
Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.880
So we took her case
very seriously.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.600
-Do you have scans?
-Six months' worth.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.680
CT, MRI, bloods,
everything came up clear.

16:15.720 --> 16:19.000
She wouldn't believe it,
kept asking for more tests.

16:19.040 --> 16:22.200
In the end, she walked out,
saying she wanted
to get a second opinion.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.920
Do you know who
she saw next?

16:23.960 --> 16:26.680
I don't think
she saw anyone else.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.680
Why?

16:28.720 --> 16:32.160
One of her MRI scans came back
after she stormed out.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.800
Again, all clear.

16:33.840 --> 16:37.760
When she didn't respond
to phone calls,
we sent it to her.

16:37.800 --> 16:41.160
Along with a letter
confirming there was
absolutely no brain tumour.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.600
No response.

16:42.640 --> 16:46.280
And no other oncologist has ever
requested her complete file.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.800
Then, a year later,

16:49.840 --> 16:51.640
I happened across her video.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.800
Turning her back
on conventional medicine?

16:54.840 --> 16:57.280
Because it couldn't
treat her condition.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.200
She didn't have a condition.

16:59.240 --> 17:01.040
You didn't follow up?

17:01.080 --> 17:03.960
I tried, but her manager
wouldn't let me
anywhere near her.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.480
Her manager?

17:10.680 --> 17:12.960
I still can't believe
she's gone.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.920
She fought like crazy
against her cancer.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.640
To die like this just...

17:18.960 --> 17:21.400
You two must have
been very close.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.480
Did Taylor have family?

17:24.520 --> 17:27.040
She was only 11 when
her mother and brother died.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.359
No dad?

17:28.400 --> 17:31.200
Just a series of foster homes.
None of them great.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.880
And then she came in
for a modelling cold call.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.040
She was going to be the next
big thing, and then cancer
killed her modelling career.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.400
And launched her
Minerals For Living career.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.560
This was not just
about making money.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.440
This really works.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.040
Taylor had a scan
two weeks ago.
Her tumour had gone.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.520
She never had one.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.520
Taylor never had
Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome.

17:55.560 --> 17:56.760
But I was there
for all the tests.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.640
Which came up negative.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.440
And then she got
that final scan.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.920
-That gave her the all clear.
-What?

18:05.600 --> 18:07.600
That's not what
Taylor told me.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.000
It'll be here somewhere.
She kept everything.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.680
Try this one.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.920
Connor Harris.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.240
Hate mail.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.200
Yeah, I told her we should
go to the police about him.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.520
She said it was the price
she paid for getting
her message out there.

18:38.760 --> 18:39.760
Here.

18:42.400 --> 18:47.000
"Scans display no traces of
brain tumour, past or present."

18:49.080 --> 18:50.560
So the whole thing was a lie?

18:51.600 --> 18:53.000
What about her symptoms?

18:53.040 --> 18:55.240
The fainting, the dizziness,
the vomiting?

18:55.280 --> 18:58.640
More than likely
caused by the cure.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.480
Well, what do I do?

19:02.520 --> 19:04.920
People believe in this.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.480
We're still mailing this stuff
out to hundreds of clients.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.760
Then I suggest you stop.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.480
Well, it's all over anyway.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.680
Connor Harris killed her.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.480
He killed all of this, too.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.680
[Callan] So there's no proof
this other guy you say shot
you killed the chemist?

19:28.720 --> 19:32.400
-Not yet, no.
-So, her stay in gaol
is not temporary?!

19:32.440 --> 19:34.520
-Callan...
-I don't know what to do!

19:34.560 --> 19:36.800
I don't.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.200
Look at you.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.080
You've got nine degrees
and you don't know what to do.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.800
-I'm doing everything
that I can.
-I know.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.200
I'm just...

19:45.840 --> 19:47.600
I'm just really scared
that's not enough.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.640
'Cause none of this--
none of this is Fern's fault.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.480
I know!
It's mine!

19:56.160 --> 19:57.640
And I'm going
to make it right.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.600
[sighs]

20:22.560 --> 20:24.200
I cannot talk to you about it.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.840
I know why you need to know.
I heard about Fern.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.160
But anything I say could
compromise her as well.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.080
Then just tell me that you ran
the tests for succinylcholine.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.440
I'm telling you
nothing of the sort.

20:37.640 --> 20:40.000
The only thing I could say,

20:40.040 --> 20:42.240
from one colleague to another,

20:42.280 --> 20:46.400
hypothetically talking
about scientific matters,

20:46.440 --> 20:49.680
is that a body that has
been in a significant fire

20:49.720 --> 20:52.120
would not be a candidate
for the testing of something

20:52.160 --> 20:55.480
in such minute traces
as succinylcholine.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.360
I am sorry.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.160
[cellphone vibrates]

21:36.200 --> 21:37.560

the two, poor chap.

21:51.640 --> 21:55.280
Got bitten by both,
but you'll never guess
which one killed him.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.040
The dog.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.200
Ah. Well, exactly.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.720
Snake's venom wasn't
strong enough to kill him.

22:01.760 --> 22:05.440
He got bloody sepsis
from the dog bite.

22:05.480 --> 22:08.200
Because he was too proud to
seek help when he needed it.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.120
Yeah. Right, all right,
what's going on?

22:13.160 --> 22:15.440
You remember when
I came to see you at Port
Astor?

22:15.480 --> 22:18.320
We discussed Francis Chester?

22:18.360 --> 22:20.720
Yes.

22:20.760 --> 22:23.000
I'm sorry to bring
this up again, but

22:23.040 --> 22:28.040
is there any way that body
you autopsied was not
Francis Chester?

22:28.080 --> 22:30.000
This old chestnut.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.320
We all make mistakes, Laurie.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.000
The burned body
from the prison,

22:35.040 --> 22:36.720
well, if it wasn't Chester,
then who the hell was it?

22:36.760 --> 22:38.440
I don't know.

22:38.480 --> 22:42.600
And that body miraculously
completely matches Chester
in every way,

22:42.640 --> 22:44.440
right down to
the bloody dental records.

22:44.480 --> 22:48.080
Which means someone would have
had to alter those records.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.960
Not incompetence then,
you're suggesting I'm corrupt.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.080
No, Laurie!

22:55.120 --> 22:56.880
I don't want it to be either.

22:56.920 --> 23:00.000
Well, then I would suggest
that we end this call

23:00.040 --> 23:03.400
before we say more things
that we will regret.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.040

Yeah, yeah. Fine, fine.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.160
-[Fern] Dad?
-Bub, you okay?

25:32.200 --> 25:34.600
Yeah, but the calls are timed,
so I won't have long.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.800
So, you're alright?

25:36.840 --> 25:38.960
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.640
Dad, have you found anything
about the fire?

25:42.680 --> 25:45.960
No. Not yet, but I will.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.520
I'm getting in touch with the
Deputy Coroner. He'll have--

25:49.560 --> 25:51.400
No-one believes you, do they?

25:52.800 --> 25:54.680
No.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.480
Well, I do.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.720
[woman] Time's up, caller.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.680
Doug, it's Dan Harrow again.

26:21.720 --> 26:24.320
I'm sorry to be annoying,
but it really is quite urgent.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.440
Good morning.
What are you doing?

26:33.480 --> 26:36.360
-Having coffee.
-You don't drink coffee.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.520
That's why it's untouched.

26:41.880 --> 26:44.880
So, why are you really here?
Who are you avoiding?

26:44.920 --> 26:46.920
Connor Harris,

26:46.960 --> 26:48.880
the man arrested
for Taylor Ford's murder,

26:48.920 --> 26:50.760
his girlfriend Rebecca is here.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.600
Ah. The stage four one?

26:52.640 --> 26:53.960
Mm-hmm.

26:55.560 --> 26:56.560
Where?

27:10.360 --> 27:12.920
The police wouldn't
talk to me,

27:12.960 --> 27:17.520
um, but... I need
to talk to someone.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.720
My boyfriend
didn't kill her.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.160
He wouldn't.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.240
[coughing]

27:29.280 --> 27:30.400
Pain?

27:31.320 --> 27:32.600
Yep.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.520
Are you taking
anything for it?

27:37.960 --> 27:39.200
How long have you got?

27:40.080 --> 27:42.040
Um... three months.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.440
Well, two and a half now.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.240
So the doctors
told me.

27:49.080 --> 27:52.040
I saw Connor's emails
to Taylor.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.840
He said he wanted her dead.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.760
He was just frustrated...

27:56.800 --> 27:57.960
with me.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.280
He can't understand
why I gave up on the chemo.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.080
But MFL works.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.920
It worked for Taylor.
It cured her.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.560
It actually didn't.

28:09.600 --> 28:13.320
Those supplements
were making her sicker.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.760
If you're taking them,
I suggest you stop.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.360
No.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.520
She posted her last scan.
Her brain tumour was gone.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.760
[sighs]

28:21.800 --> 28:24.560
She never had a brain tumour.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.920
I'm afraid you've been
terribly misled.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.480
[groans]

28:30.680 --> 28:32.320
You're all in it together.

28:32.360 --> 28:35.280
Doctors.
Big pharmaceuticals.

28:35.320 --> 28:36.760
Protecting your reputations.

28:36.800 --> 28:40.520
We're not. It's Taylor
who was deceiving people.

28:40.560 --> 28:43.280
My boyfriend is not a killer.

28:43.320 --> 28:46.640
So, if you think that he did it,
you're wrong.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.080
[Grace] You believe her?

28:56.120 --> 28:58.560
I believe her belief.

28:58.600 --> 29:01.280
She's convinced her boyfriend's
not the killer.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.520
I don't think he is either.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.920
Lab results are back.
Everything you'd expect.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.560
High levels of heavy metals
in her brain and other organs.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.480
No wonder she was so sick.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.640
Mercury, lead, aluminium.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.560
Well, that explains the
vomiting, the fainting spells.

29:16.600 --> 29:21.280
Only, Connor's defence will be
able to argue that she fainted
and fell, she wasn't pushed.

29:21.320 --> 29:25.000
Only you don't think
the brain injury from the fall
is what killed her.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.800
And Connor can't even explain
why he was there at all.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.240
Hovering over her body.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.400
"Hovering"?

29:32.440 --> 29:35.080
Yes, why was he hovering?

29:48.080 --> 29:49.080
[exhales]

29:54.440 --> 29:57.720
I thought this inner lip damage
was from the fall.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.800
I was so busy concentrating
on her throat, I missed it.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.480
You see?
It looks... grazed.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.120
Tissue damage from her teeth.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.280
If someone pressed
on her nose and mouth,

30:09.320 --> 30:11.040
that could explain the marks.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.360
Asphyxiation.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.440
And if she was held
tight enough to suffocate,

30:14.480 --> 30:16.920
the killer could've left DNA
on her face.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.640
Let's swab the skin around
her nose and her mouth.

30:19.680 --> 30:22.320
-[cellphone vibrates]
-Hello?

30:23.800 --> 30:26.240
What, she's here now?
I'll be right out.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.800
Taylor's oncologist.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.040
-[Harrow] Dr Peterson.
-Hi.

30:36.080 --> 30:38.760
Um, we had a Practice meeting
this morning,

30:38.800 --> 30:42.040
and I mentioned in passing
the death of Taylor Ford
and your visit.

30:42.080 --> 30:46.200
One of the other oncologists
said Taylor made an appointment
to see her two weeks ago.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.520
I was away at the time.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.160
Why did she come back?

30:50.200 --> 30:53.240
Apparently, she was becoming
increasingly worried
about her symptoms.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.360
She knew they didn't match
what her mother and brother had.

30:56.760 --> 31:00.040
Because they had a brain tumour
and she was being poisoned.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.440
Did the other oncologist
run any tests?

31:07.480 --> 31:10.040
-MRI. Again, no tumour.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.720
And I assume Taylor took this

31:12.760 --> 31:15.720
as evidence that her poisonous
supplements were working.

31:15.760 --> 31:20.480
Until my partner showed her
the original letter and scan
we sent two years ago,

31:20.520 --> 31:24.080
informing her then that
she'd never had VHL Syndrome.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.160
She claimed she'd never
seen them before.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.120
What? How?

31:30.960 --> 31:32.440
I've seen them.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.960
They're in her filing cabinet.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.520
-She said that all her mail
goes through--
-Her manager.

31:46.120 --> 31:49.400
You knew where to find that
letter and scan yesterday

31:49.440 --> 31:51.240
because you only put it there
after Taylor was dead.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.720
This is ridiculous.
I'm busy.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.720
I need to sort
through Taylor's accounts.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.480
Oh, yes, I'm sure you do.

31:56.520 --> 31:59.880
Exactly how much money
were you making from
Taylor the Cancer Survivor

31:59.920 --> 32:03.160
and her miracle supplements?
It must have been a lot for you
to hide that letter from her.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.680
If you don't leave,
I'm calling the police.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.600
An excellent idea.
Why don't I do it?

32:07.640 --> 32:10.880
What's the penalty
for corporate fraud these days?

32:10.920 --> 32:12.440
I'm guessing prison.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.080
Wait.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.520
By the time that letter arrived,
Taylor was well down the
Minerals For Living path.

32:21.560 --> 32:24.640
Her social media was going nuts,
publishing and vlogging deals
were rolling in.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.480
-The money was enormous.
-And that's all you cared about.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.080
For her.

32:29.120 --> 32:32.720
Once her modelling career
was over Taylor had nothing.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.880
All I did was withhold
one letter.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.920
But Taylor found out,
didn't she, when she went
back to the oncologist?

32:39.240 --> 32:40.280
What happened?

32:40.320 --> 32:42.840
I'm imagining she was angry.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.640
We argued, yes.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.480
-Why didn't you
tell me the truth?
-You didn't want to know!

32:49.520 --> 32:53.560
The partnership soured
because she wanted to go public.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.160
And I told her
we'd look like frauds.
We might both go to gaol.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.040
Did you push her
down the stairs?

32:58.080 --> 33:01.400
No! This happened days ago.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.640
I was nowhere near here
when Taylor died.

33:04.680 --> 33:05.920
[Nichols] That part checks out.

33:05.960 --> 33:08.240
She was at a management meeting
all morning.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.920
Five other people
confirm she was there.

33:09.960 --> 33:11.720
She deluded
hundreds of people

33:11.760 --> 33:14.280
into buying a product
that she knew didn't work!

33:14.320 --> 33:16.200
She could be responsible
for their deaths.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.960
Yeah, yeah, and I'll be
handing the whole brief
over to the Fraud Squad.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.240
But she didn't kill Taylor.

33:21.280 --> 33:22.320
[Harrow sighs]

33:22.360 --> 33:24.160
Okay? Which leaves us
with Connor Harris.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.000
-Hmm...
-Any progress on that front?

33:27.040 --> 33:29.640
Still waiting
for DNA to come back.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.360
And... here it is.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.560
-DNA?
-No.

33:35.240 --> 33:38.680
But I did ask Scientific
to run the swabs through
the mass spectrometer.

33:38.720 --> 33:41.360
And? Cannabinoids?

33:41.400 --> 33:43.040
Mmm. Traces.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.920
-In the sweat
around her nose and mouth.
-Marijuana?

33:45.960 --> 33:48.920
Why is the clean-living
yoga-loving health guru
smoking joints?

33:48.960 --> 33:51.880
She wasn't.
No trace in her tox results.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.240
You were right,
she was smothered.

33:54.280 --> 33:57.200
By someone using cannabis.

33:58.520 --> 34:02.160
The door was open, I walked in,
and I found her like that.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.160
Now, you claim
you didn't touch her.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.320
No.

34:07.360 --> 34:08.800
Not even to check
if she was still alive.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.159
I told you, no.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.719
I could see
she wasn't, so...

34:14.679 --> 34:17.000
Okay, well... great.

34:17.040 --> 34:21.120
If all that's true,
we can clear you immediately.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.679
How?

34:22.719 --> 34:24.480
Oh, we just need
a blood sample.

34:25.639 --> 34:27.840
-Okay. When?
-[door opens]

34:27.880 --> 34:30.040
Well, as it happens,
we have a doctor right here.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.360
-[door closes]
-You're gonna do this right now?

34:32.400 --> 34:34.920
Yeah, sooner we're done,
sooner you're out of here.

34:37.800 --> 34:41.239
How exactly is my blood
gonna prove whether Taylor
fell or was pushed?

34:41.280 --> 34:44.159
Oh, it won't, because
the fall didn't kill her.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.280
Taylor was asphyxiated
by someone smoking dope.

34:49.480 --> 34:52.600
So, if there's no cannabis
in your system,
you'll be clear to go.

34:54.800 --> 34:55.800
Wait!

34:57.280 --> 34:58.800
Don't bother.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.800
You'll find what
you're looking for.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.200
You smothered Taylor Ford?

35:07.160 --> 35:08.160
Yes.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.200
[Nichols] Take care of it.

35:21.840 --> 35:25.000
Don't you think that was
a little too easy?

35:25.040 --> 35:27.480
God, I wish
they were all like that.

35:27.520 --> 35:31.440
I mean, why is he gonna
cop to 15 years gaol for
a murder he didn't commit?

35:34.840 --> 35:36.760
-What?
-Oh!

35:42.920 --> 35:45.120
-Congratulations.
-For what?

35:45.160 --> 35:47.640
Finally letting the cleaners
into your office.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.720
I'm sure they're traumatized.

35:51.920 --> 35:53.400
[Harrow] Stop!

35:53.440 --> 35:55.040
[relieved sigh]

35:55.080 --> 35:56.400
Gloves.

35:56.440 --> 35:58.840
Whew!

36:14.600 --> 36:16.320
[machine beeps]

36:16.360 --> 36:20.720
[woman on P.A.]
Dr Shaw, maternity ward.
Dr Shaw to maternity.

36:29.880 --> 36:33.120
I'm glad you've re-embraced
conventional medicine.

36:36.040 --> 36:41.200
Although that's not what you use
for pain relief, is it?

36:41.240 --> 36:45.280
So, um, what? You going to
arrest me for smoking dope?

36:46.840 --> 36:49.640
No... murder.

36:52.920 --> 36:55.600
When you covered
Taylor's nose and mouth,

36:55.640 --> 37:00.200
your sweat left markers
from the cannabis
you've been smoking.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.160
[coughs]

37:02.840 --> 37:04.160
[Harrow] Cannabinoids.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.760
[sighs]

37:08.040 --> 37:10.080
How did you find out
she was a fake?

37:11.520 --> 37:12.800
You must have gone
to her office

37:12.840 --> 37:17.840
to pick up your Minerals
For Living package.

37:18.760 --> 37:20.280
Was Connor with you?

37:21.960 --> 37:23.720
Um, no, he'd...

37:24.840 --> 37:26.280
driven off, um...

37:28.160 --> 37:29.920
We'd had a fight.

37:29.960 --> 37:33.120
I don't understand
why you keep taking this shit
when it's not working!

37:33.160 --> 37:35.640
If I don't have your support,
then I may as well be alone!

37:35.680 --> 37:37.800
-Okay?
-Fine!

37:40.360 --> 37:42.520
[Rebecca] I could hear
her voice.

37:42.560 --> 37:47.280
[Taylor] That scan you saw
posted on my website...

37:48.320 --> 37:50.120
She sounded different, um...

37:52.320 --> 37:54.040
Upset.

37:55.480 --> 37:59.040
And I've just found out
I've never had a tumour.

37:59.880 --> 38:01.520
It was all a lie.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.400
[Harrow] A confession.

38:04.440 --> 38:07.720
-You confronted her.
-What? No, no, no, no...

38:07.760 --> 38:08.960
MFL works!

38:09.000 --> 38:10.920
-You said--
-No, no, no.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.720
I'm so...
I'm so sorry, okay?

38:13.760 --> 38:16.360
I was so angry.

38:17.760 --> 38:20.520
While I was getting
sicker and sicker,

38:20.560 --> 38:23.120
she was getting
richer and richer.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.840
She blamed her manager.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.640
She lied to me!
She lied to all of us!

38:29.680 --> 38:32.560

The idea the man
who killed their loved one
might not be dead...

40:44.040 --> 40:46.080
And it undermines
the public's faith

40:46.120 --> 40:47.880

40:47.920 --> 40:51.920
But if Chester isn't
in that grave, then we haven't
done our jobs, Doug.

40:51.960 --> 40:54.600
And he's already killed again,
twice that we know of.

41:53.080 --> 41:56.160
My son committed awful,

with that for 15 years,
but he is dead now.

grieve for him?

I can only grieve
for a four-year-old

42:32.360 --> 42:35.360

then maybe I can stop
some other mother's son
from killing six people.

42:59.080 --> 43:02.720
And if I'm right,
we still need to stop this one.

43:02.760 --> 43:05.000

in a prison fire.

to pull this off,
it would be your son.
