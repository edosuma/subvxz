14:41.077 --> 14:44.141
Penguin's too smart to get
nailed for that, anyway.

14:44.413 --> 14:46.514
What do you mean?

14:46.549 --> 14:48.849
Get him to do something
you can really bust him for.

14:48.885 --> 14:52.319
And then yank his ass
off the street once and for all.

14:52.664 --> 14:55.688
- You're saying start a war.
- I'm saying get him to start one.

14:55.825 --> 14:57.491
You know he's gonna come for her.

14:57.641 --> 14:59.667
I don't give a tinker's damn
about Sofia.

14:59.722 --> 15:01.095
The way I see it,
everything that's happened,

15:01.130 --> 15:02.496
down to Don Falcone

15:02.532 --> 15:05.432
lying in that box, comes from
you deciding months ago

15:05.503 --> 15:07.464
to go after Penguin.

15:07.770 --> 15:10.246
This is all on you.

15:11.707 --> 15:14.175
So finish what you started.

15:22.552 --> 15:24.518
(sighs)

15:25.493 --> 15:27.700
Good-bye, old friend.

15:29.632 --> 15:32.700
I will not forget
all that you taught me.

15:41.904 --> 15:44.271
I had great respect for your father.

15:45.260 --> 15:47.288
But once he's in the ground, you are...

15:47.316 --> 15:49.116
Excuse me.

15:58.461 --> 16:00.628
Not here! (clears throat)

16:02.999 --> 16:04.398
What are you doing, Jim?

16:04.620 --> 16:06.220
Finishing what I started.

16:16.694 --> 16:17.951
Go back. Stop.

16:18.007 --> 16:19.779
All right, all right.

16:21.633 --> 16:22.997
(amplified tapping)

16:23.022 --> 16:24.767
(over P.A.): Testing, testing.

16:24.802 --> 16:25.898
One, two, three.

16:25.935 --> 16:27.669
James Gordon.

16:28.573 --> 16:29.939
James Gordon?

16:32.143 --> 16:33.910
What do you want, Oswald?

16:34.082 --> 16:36.549
You know what I want.

16:36.584 --> 16:37.884
Where is she?

16:37.981 --> 16:39.481
No.

16:40.386 --> 16:44.085
You're seriously going to go
to war... for her? (laughs)

16:44.121 --> 16:45.687
I'm upholding the law.

16:46.677 --> 16:50.012
No one gets to decide
who lives or dies in Gotham.

16:50.723 --> 16:53.251
Can you not see, Jim,

16:53.287 --> 16:55.720
she has manipulated you, lied to you...

16:55.745 --> 16:57.503
The law is the law.

16:57.858 --> 17:02.327
Now, either get over it
or face the consequences.

17:02.362 --> 17:04.362
(feedback hums)

17:06.098 --> 17:08.098
Let's try it this way.

17:10.257 --> 17:12.866
Sofia Falcone is in this building.

17:12.929 --> 17:16.960
Whoever brings her to me
will be richly rewarded.

17:17.021 --> 17:18.777
I'm going to count to five...

17:18.811 --> 17:20.212
Count as much as you want, twerp.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.480
Yeah, we don't work for you.

17:24.751 --> 17:28.019
This man is asking you
to risk your lives

17:28.055 --> 17:30.483
to protect a gangster.

17:31.522 --> 17:34.226
I am offering you money, huh?

17:34.261 --> 17:36.728
And, bonus,

17:36.763 --> 17:39.397
no one gets killed! (laughs)

17:39.433 --> 17:41.633
Hey, Captain, can we...?

17:41.668 --> 17:42.934
Sure.

17:43.998 --> 17:45.704
- Get off of me.
- Come on.

17:45.739 --> 17:47.105
Blood will run, Jim.

17:47.140 --> 17:48.607
Mark my words!

17:48.642 --> 17:50.181
Blood will run!

17:50.290 --> 17:51.910
And it will be on your head!

17:51.945 --> 17:54.045
Get off of me!

18:04.191 --> 18:07.203
From the first day I put on the badge,

18:07.995 --> 18:10.613
I was told things could never change.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.363
Gotham was corrupt.

18:13.867 --> 18:15.500
GCPD was corrupt.

18:16.511 --> 18:19.329
Criminals and lowlifes ran things.

18:22.542 --> 18:25.176
You just showed me different.

18:26.546 --> 18:28.518
Penguin will be coming.

18:29.869 --> 18:32.984
It's time we showed Gotham who we are.

18:35.822 --> 18:37.622
Suit up!

18:37.658 --> 18:39.658
♪ ♪

18:48.135 --> 18:51.169
Move, move! Take 'em out!

18:53.807 --> 18:55.907
♪ ♪

19:23.747 --> 19:25.067
Just let us go.

19:25.130 --> 19:26.871
You've obviously got your hands full.

19:26.907 --> 19:28.306
Shut up!

19:28.342 --> 19:29.774
Whatever.

19:29.810 --> 19:31.843
They'll all be dead in a few minutes.

19:31.878 --> 19:33.878
Listen, you stupid...

19:35.849 --> 19:38.483
(gunfire continues, officer
speaking over bullhorn outside)

19:47.394 --> 19:49.194
More left.

19:51.404 --> 19:52.764
She means your left.

19:52.897 --> 19:55.100
Then say that.

19:56.800 --> 19:57.802
(gunshot)

19:59.628 --> 20:01.673
Your left! Your left! Your left!
Your left! Your left!

20:01.708 --> 20:03.074
(gunshot)

20:04.611 --> 20:07.979
Hmm. Yay, teamwork.

20:08.815 --> 20:10.815
(indistinct chatter)

20:13.548 --> 20:15.423
SOFIA: You're winning.

20:15.622 --> 20:17.000
So far.

20:17.124 --> 20:19.891
But every gang in Gotham
owes Penguin allegiance.

20:19.926 --> 20:21.813
I can't arrest them all.

20:21.945 --> 20:24.295
So arrest Penguin.
Wasn't that the point?

20:24.331 --> 20:27.329
As long as he's using proxies,
he's protected.

20:27.454 --> 20:29.176
I have to keep pressing him.

20:29.267 --> 20:30.535
When his back's against the wall,

20:30.570 --> 20:33.071
he'll do something
he can't take back or explain.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.572
And then I'll have him.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.107
So you're baiting him into committing

20:36.143 --> 20:38.143
a public atrocity.

20:41.948 --> 20:44.128
What if he already has?

20:45.018 --> 20:47.952
There's this boy
from my orphanage, Martin.

20:47.988 --> 20:49.754
Oswald cared for him.

20:50.759 --> 20:53.158
I hid him away for his safety,

20:53.193 --> 20:55.994
but Oswald forced me

20:56.029 --> 20:58.126
into telling him where Martin was,

20:58.498 --> 21:01.493
and then put him in a car
and blew it up.

21:02.571 --> 21:04.636
Why didn't you tell me this before?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.772
Because I'm his enemy.
Who's going to believe me?

21:07.808 --> 21:10.075
Also, I didn't see him plant the bomb.

21:10.110 --> 21:12.477
- So you have nothing.
- I didn't say that.

21:12.512 --> 21:16.781
Oswald never understood the way
people cared for my father.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.585
And one of those people just called me.

21:21.968 --> 21:24.289
How is Jim Gordon beating us?!

21:24.324 --> 21:26.958
ZSASZ: Well, every cop
in Gotham is behind him.

21:26.993 --> 21:29.837
I'm guessing he has
great leadership skills.

21:31.641 --> 21:34.469
Victor, when this is said and done,

21:34.548 --> 21:37.335
you and I need to have
a frank discussion

21:37.370 --> 21:39.563
about chain of command.

21:40.063 --> 21:41.629
But now...

21:41.741 --> 21:43.473
go do something horrific!

21:43.566 --> 21:45.477
Show the GCPD exactly...

21:45.512 --> 21:47.112
GORDON: Oswald Cobblepot!

21:47.848 --> 21:49.514
You're under arrest.

21:51.251 --> 21:53.017
Have you completely lost your mind?

21:53.053 --> 21:55.718
Nobody has to die.
We only want Cobblepot.

21:55.781 --> 21:58.187
OSWALD: Well, see, Jim,
that's a problem,

21:58.249 --> 22:00.132
as they work for me. (chuckles)

22:00.226 --> 22:02.660
But just so I know, what's the charge?

22:02.982 --> 22:04.863
Murder.

22:06.554 --> 22:08.053
Enough.

22:08.170 --> 22:10.802
Enough! I did not kill Don Falcone,

22:10.837 --> 22:12.871
and I dare you to prove otherwise.

22:12.906 --> 22:14.639
It's not for Falcone.

22:14.674 --> 22:16.641
I'm arresting you
for the murder of the boy

22:16.676 --> 22:19.210
you blew up
under the Crown Point Bridge.

22:20.914 --> 22:22.547
(snickering)

22:22.988 --> 22:24.582
What's so funny?

22:26.620 --> 22:28.353
Nothing. (chuckles)

22:28.388 --> 22:31.605
Well, everything actually,
'cause, 'cause, you see,

22:31.691 --> 22:34.392
he's not dead. (laughs)

22:35.605 --> 22:37.896
I only faked his death

22:37.963 --> 22:41.197
so that Sofia Falcone
couldn't use him against me.

22:41.468 --> 22:43.935
She's the one who told you
I killed him, isn't she?

22:43.970 --> 22:45.737
Then where is he?

22:46.940 --> 22:48.940
He, uh... I don't know.

22:48.975 --> 22:51.413
Victor took him out of Gotham. Tell him.

22:51.603 --> 22:53.669
ZSASZ: What's to tell?

22:55.448 --> 22:57.882
You blew that kid sky-high.

22:59.886 --> 23:01.152
OSWALD: What?

23:02.422 --> 23:04.956
You sent that pipsqueak to kingdom come.

23:04.991 --> 23:06.457
No.

23:06.493 --> 23:07.759
That's not true.

23:07.794 --> 23:09.701
And I'll testify to that.

23:10.096 --> 23:11.930
- What?
- Look...

23:11.965 --> 23:15.459
I ain't taking the rap
for no kid murder.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.302
(yells)

23:17.337 --> 23:18.336
- Hey!
- Get him out of here!

23:18.361 --> 23:21.905
You are lying! You are a lying traitor!

23:21.930 --> 23:23.937
Victor Zsasz is a liar!

23:23.999 --> 23:26.244
No! I will kill you!

23:26.279 --> 23:27.245
Traitor!

23:27.280 --> 23:29.447
(Oswald grunting)

23:29.482 --> 23:33.339
This... doesn't give you
a free pass, you know.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.300
Jim...

23:36.623 --> 23:38.623
not now.

23:55.977 --> 23:57.579
You did it, Cap.

23:57.711 --> 23:59.500
You won.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.150
Yeah, Captain!

24:06.186 --> 24:07.552
Way to go, Captain!

24:16.711 --> 24:19.931
So I'm guessing Gordon doesn't
know the kid's actually alive.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.148
SOFIA: Jim Gordon played his part.

24:22.195 --> 24:24.469
He showed the underworld
that Penguin was weak.

24:24.504 --> 24:25.905
That he did.

24:26.039 --> 24:27.338
End of the day,

24:28.584 --> 24:30.780
he's a Cobblepot.

24:32.108 --> 24:34.145
You're a Falcone.

24:41.061 --> 24:42.887
SOFIA: Smile, ladies.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.130
It's a new day.

24:48.053 --> 24:50.795
So, Sofia was as good as her word.

24:50.874 --> 24:52.874
We got our club back.

24:52.984 --> 24:55.851
Yippee. We get to serve drinks again.

24:55.953 --> 24:58.376
It's just a base of operations.

24:58.501 --> 25:00.532
But I am meeting with the designer later

25:00.587 --> 25:02.876
to make it less... Penguiny.

25:03.158 --> 25:04.958
Have fun.

25:06.360 --> 25:09.069
Music to soothe the savage beast?

25:09.363 --> 25:11.363
Something like that.

25:22.743 --> 25:24.576
Alfred!

25:26.347 --> 25:28.413
Oh, the front page is up.

25:28.515 --> 25:30.649
Didn't expect you
to brave the light of day

25:30.751 --> 25:32.971
for a couple more hours, Master B.

25:33.187 --> 25:35.627
Tommy wanted to go to the horse races.

25:36.090 --> 25:38.090
What's all this?

25:38.192 --> 25:40.212
ALFRED: It's little project of mine.

25:40.290 --> 25:42.661
I like to call it
Operation Save Bruce Wayne.

25:42.763 --> 25:43.962
(chuckles)

25:44.407 --> 25:45.506
Switzerland.

25:45.632 --> 25:48.133
Few months up in the Alps,
you'll be tickety-boo.

25:48.235 --> 25:49.601
(chuckles)

25:49.703 --> 25:51.703
Are you going to kidnap me?

25:52.429 --> 25:55.949
No, I'm gonna appeal
to your better angels.

25:56.410 --> 25:58.477
And if that doesn't work, I shall beg.

25:59.544 --> 26:01.380
Please, Master Bruce.

26:03.717 --> 26:06.121
If for no other reason, do it for me.

26:12.136 --> 26:13.692
These past weeks, you know how much

26:13.794 --> 26:15.453
I've thought about Ra's al Ghul?

26:15.896 --> 26:17.996
About my parents?

26:18.098 --> 26:19.798
Not at all, Alfred.

26:19.900 --> 26:21.767
All you're offering me is pain.

26:21.869 --> 26:24.169
Well, there is no life without pain.

26:24.271 --> 26:26.104
There's no love, there's no joy.

26:26.206 --> 26:28.373
I don't know about that.
I'm having a fair amount of joy.

26:28.438 --> 26:30.869
You're bloody miserable is what
you are, mate. I can see it.

26:32.542 --> 26:34.967
Alfred, I know you care about me.

26:35.779 --> 26:39.114
But I'm asking you
to stop what you're doing.

26:39.216 --> 26:41.264
I'm not who you thought I was.

26:41.327 --> 26:42.846
I'm not who my parents
might've wanted me to be,

26:42.893 --> 26:44.486
and I'm okay with that!

26:44.579 --> 26:46.056
But I'm not okay with it.

26:46.112 --> 26:48.750
- And I don't believe it.
- And that's your problem.

26:49.393 --> 26:51.693
Now I'm gonna go meet Tommy.

26:53.063 --> 26:55.397
I can't let you do that, Master Bruce.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.638
You gonna stop me?

27:05.187 --> 27:06.856
If needs be, yes.

27:06.943 --> 27:08.943
(chuckles softly)

27:11.048 --> 27:12.947
You really think you can?

27:14.214 --> 27:15.283
Oh, I know I can.

27:16.753 --> 27:19.120
I just don't want you to make me try.

27:20.724 --> 27:22.057
Well...

27:26.830 --> 27:28.163
Don't do this, Master Bruce.

27:28.265 --> 27:30.298
No, Alfred, we're doing this.

27:31.635 --> 27:32.967
(Alfred shouts)

27:38.177 --> 27:39.886
You're getting slow, Master Bruce.

27:40.021 --> 27:41.709
You haven't been training,
have you, son?

27:41.812 --> 27:44.112
- Got a bit of ring rust.
- Really?

27:44.347 --> 27:47.052
Because you're the only one
breathing hard, old man.

27:49.286 --> 27:50.852
(grunting)

27:50.954 --> 27:53.361
Just stop it, will you?!

27:53.424 --> 27:55.657
Stop it! Stop...

27:55.759 --> 27:57.325
- Fine.
- All right?

27:57.427 --> 27:58.927
Fine.

28:02.265 --> 28:03.698
Oh, no.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.533
Master Bruce, I'm so sorry.

28:05.635 --> 28:07.502
I-I don't know what came
over me, mate. I'm...

28:07.604 --> 28:09.704

28:13.043 --> 28:14.742

28:14.845 --> 28:17.712

- I am in control!

28:17.814 --> 28:19.180
Me. Ed Nygma.

28:19.282 --> 28:20.915
(echoing): But why would you want that?

28:21.017 --> 28:22.350
You don't understand.

28:22.452 --> 28:24.552
We had so much fun when we were me.

28:25.458 --> 28:27.238
Oh, no.

28:27.762 --> 28:29.357
Tell me it's not that.

28:30.144 --> 28:31.426
Not what?

28:31.528 --> 28:32.894
I leave when spurned.

28:32.996 --> 28:35.096
I give all. I take nothing.

28:35.195 --> 28:37.565
I can raise you to a king
or make you to a beggar.

28:37.667 --> 28:39.567
What am I?

28:40.492 --> 28:43.238
Okay, I'm just gonna tell you,
'cause you're not gonna get it.

28:43.340 --> 28:45.773
- Love.
- I am in control!

28:45.876 --> 28:48.076
You're in love with Lee
Thompkins, you pathetic loser.

28:48.178 --> 28:49.244
Shut up!

28:52.816 --> 28:54.215
Ed...

28:54.511 --> 28:56.456
angry at mirror?

28:56.534 --> 28:58.953
No, Grundy, I'm not angry at the mirror.

28:59.055 --> 28:59.954
Ed...

29:00.056 --> 29:02.790
angry at... Ed?

29:02.893 --> 29:05.109
That is...

29:05.328 --> 29:07.629
surprisingly perceptive.

29:07.926 --> 29:10.304

you called me Tabby, remember?

30:33.736 --> 30:35.995
Grundy want to go back to friend Ed.

Ed.

30:37.812 --> 30:39.422
Right.

30:39.490 --> 30:41.140
Your friend.

30:41.476 --> 30:44.193
Well, your best friend Ed

30:44.228 --> 30:46.095
tied you and me to chairs,
electrocuted you,

30:46.130 --> 30:47.663
and cut off my hand.

30:48.507 --> 30:50.256
Look at the scar.

30:50.334 --> 30:52.134
Ring a bell?

31:05.317 --> 31:07.424
Remember me, Butch.

31:09.420 --> 31:11.861
I'm Tabby.

31:12.379 --> 31:14.056
I'm your Tabby.

31:21.699 --> 31:23.699
Grundy sorry.

31:30.704 --> 31:33.042
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

31:38.949 --> 31:41.348
Before, when you said my name,

31:41.556 --> 31:43.323
I'd just hit you in the head.

31:45.223 --> 31:47.059
Maybe that's the only way.

31:50.528 --> 31:52.961
So you're gonna remember me, Butch.

31:55.721 --> 31:57.917
Or I'm gonna beat your head in.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.710
Pretty lady.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.400
When I called, I wasn't sure you'd come.

32:11.449 --> 32:14.216
I was going to anyway. We need to talk.

32:17.788 --> 32:19.179
I agree.

32:19.757 --> 32:22.391
I'm gonna ask you not to do
what you're about to do.

32:22.426 --> 32:23.625
Which is?

32:23.661 --> 32:25.570
Unify the gangs.

32:25.663 --> 32:27.930
Put the Falcones back in charge
of the underworld.

32:28.234 --> 32:30.899
Mm. But wasn't that our deal?

32:30.935 --> 32:32.654
I'd replace Penguin.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.193
You'd be the law, I'd be the order.

32:34.238 --> 32:36.972
No. And if you try and take over,

32:37.007 --> 32:39.287
I will have to come after you.

32:43.681 --> 32:45.723
James.

32:45.983 --> 32:48.016
You're nothing if not predictable.

32:48.505 --> 32:51.135
Now I think it's time
you heard my proposal.

32:51.205 --> 32:52.488
I'm not interested.

32:52.523 --> 32:54.523
- I think you are.
- PYG: Surprise.

32:54.558 --> 32:56.258
(gun cocks)

32:58.973 --> 33:00.621
I know.

33:01.065 --> 33:02.798
You thought I'd have a different face

33:02.833 --> 33:04.895
'cause I killed that doctor.

33:05.269 --> 33:07.566
That was just
to throw you off the scent.

33:07.638 --> 33:10.769
SOFIA: That's not why
he's surprised, Lazlo.

33:11.046 --> 33:12.644
Oh.

33:14.582 --> 33:16.628
Can I tell him?

33:17.332 --> 33:18.647
You came to this beautiful woman

33:18.682 --> 33:20.249
'cause you had a problem.

33:20.284 --> 33:21.917
A Penguin problem.

33:22.280 --> 33:24.624
Pax Penguina was gonna last.

33:25.358 --> 33:28.178
But Sofia had an idea.

33:28.412 --> 33:29.904
I'd heard of a contract killer

33:29.967 --> 33:31.527
that was impersonating
serial killers, so...

33:31.562 --> 33:33.490
What if there was a killer,

33:33.576 --> 33:34.963
real vicious

33:34.999 --> 33:39.846
son of a bitch, hunting
the police, all slice and dice?

33:39.932 --> 33:41.503
I needed the police to turn on Penguin.

33:41.539 --> 33:43.885
I knew a few cops would have to die.

33:43.954 --> 33:46.315
So you sent this monster in my city.

33:48.237 --> 33:50.068
I let him improvise.

33:50.380 --> 33:53.263
I'll admit, got a little
carried away with the whole

33:53.317 --> 33:55.884
cooking folks routine.

33:57.521 --> 33:59.960
I really got into the role.

34:00.882 --> 34:03.258
Now, the only hiccup

34:03.294 --> 34:05.194
was that mess with her daddy.

34:11.402 --> 34:13.208
It was you.

34:13.966 --> 34:16.763
I gave him a chance, Jim.

34:17.007 --> 34:19.224
And if he would have shown

34:19.310 --> 34:21.527
one iota of appreciation for

34:21.612 --> 34:25.313
everything I have done
for this family, for him,

34:25.534 --> 34:27.382
he would be alive.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.503
But I saw you shot.

34:32.877 --> 34:34.790
There was another shooter there.

34:38.690 --> 34:41.330
SOFIA: I had to do something
to throw off suspicion.

34:41.408 --> 34:43.031
PYG: She wasn't about
to get herself plugged

34:43.067 --> 34:45.187
by a bunch of yahoos in a car.

34:45.929 --> 34:48.337
It was some pretty shooting,
if I do say so.

34:49.076 --> 34:51.663
I missed all her vital parts.

34:55.165 --> 34:57.212
I'm putting you in jail, and this time,

34:57.248 --> 34:58.380
it's Blackgate!

34:58.415 --> 35:00.716
- You're gonna rot in there.
- Jim, it's just...

35:00.751 --> 35:02.417
(gunshot)

35:04.325 --> 35:06.955
(sighs) That's done now.

35:11.872 --> 35:14.499
My father had his moment of truth.

35:14.569 --> 35:16.199
This is yours.

35:17.632 --> 35:20.143
How many cops died
under the Pax Penguina?

35:20.170 --> 35:21.803
Not one.

35:21.839 --> 35:24.540
It was you who couldn't stomach it.

35:24.575 --> 35:27.576
It was you who came
to the Falcones for help.

35:27.603 --> 35:30.957
There is a direct line
from your decision

35:31.020 --> 35:34.340
to a dozen police officers
who have been brutally murdered.

35:34.451 --> 35:35.884
You're insane.

35:36.967 --> 35:39.031
Why not just kill me?

35:39.176 --> 35:40.671
Because, Jim,

35:41.265 --> 35:44.359
I need you at the head
of the GCPD. I need...

35:44.395 --> 35:47.023
Someone you can control.

35:47.598 --> 35:51.433
You've been planning this
since the day we first met.

35:51.544 --> 35:53.335
This isn't about Gotham.

35:53.388 --> 35:57.339
This is revenge... for me killing Mario.

36:02.746 --> 36:05.314
(puts gun down)

36:05.349 --> 36:08.517
You want to arrest me, arrest me.

36:10.521 --> 36:12.988
But I will talk.

36:13.023 --> 36:15.562
And the cops that died,

36:15.664 --> 36:19.528
the friend that you betrayed,
will all have been for nothing.

36:21.198 --> 36:23.959
The GCPD will crumble.

36:24.034 --> 36:26.635
Penguin, or someone worse,
will take over,

36:26.670 --> 36:30.238
and you will lose Gotham forever.

36:32.309 --> 36:33.609
Or...

36:34.445 --> 36:37.177
take on the sin as your own.

36:38.013 --> 36:41.416
Keep the GCPD, let them
think you're a hero,

36:41.452 --> 36:44.886
but live knowing who you are,
what you've done.

36:46.890 --> 36:48.991
That is my revenge.

36:53.697 --> 36:56.665

37:11.971 --> 37:14.239

37:15.786 --> 37:18.317
I just shot and killed the Pyg.

37:18.789 --> 37:19.955

37:28.936 --> 37:30.951
Oh, thank Christ.

I'm not gonna try and stop you.

37:47.511 --> 37:49.222

37:50.771 --> 37:52.813
You will remember who you are,

37:55.412 --> 37:58.413
No. You won't be.

37:59.018 --> 38:01.984
I went to my lawyer and had him
draw up emancipation papers.

38:05.823 --> 38:08.323
You're no longer my legal guardian.

38:14.970 --> 38:16.732
I won't sign 'em.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.712
