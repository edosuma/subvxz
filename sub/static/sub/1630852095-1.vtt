WEBVTT

00:48.833 --> 00:50.083
Needed their signatures.

00:50.166 --> 00:51.666
I'm telling you, it's not a problem.

00:51.750 --> 00:54.250
We have to wait a little.
The market's gonna turn around

00:54.333 --> 00:56.041
and everything will be fine.

00:58.166 --> 00:59.666
Okay. We have to sell the penthouse.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.250
No. We don't.

01:01.333 --> 01:03.958
-That's, that's--
-What? An actual solution?

01:04.041 --> 01:06.875
Maybe growing up in this place,
you got used to the idea

01:06.958 --> 01:10.000
that a solution will
just fall out of the sky. But it won't.

01:10.083 --> 01:11.541
You've got a daughter to think of.

01:11.625 --> 01:13.208
I've got it under control, Eleanor.

01:18.750 --> 01:19.916
Do you want to?

01:20.416 --> 01:22.000
Who are we kidding? You go.

01:32.083 --> 01:33.083
Kate?

01:36.250 --> 01:37.500
Coming in.

01:39.208 --> 01:40.875
You shouldn't eavesdrop.

01:42.208 --> 01:44.625
Then how would I know
what you're saying when I'm not there?

01:47.125 --> 01:49.291
I don't know how to argue with that.

01:50.166 --> 01:51.666
How much did you hear?

01:52.500 --> 01:54.166
I don't want to move.

01:55.333 --> 01:56.583
That much, huh?

01:59.458 --> 02:01.875
-We don't have to.
-How do you know?

02:02.500 --> 02:05.166
Mommy said things
don't just fall from the sky.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.750
Well, yeah,
but there's always gonna be weather.

02:09.375 --> 02:11.958
Some people forget
the one thing they can control,

02:12.541 --> 02:15.041
the choices they make in the face of it.

02:17.791 --> 02:20.291
What would you do in a hurricane?

02:20.958 --> 02:23.166
I would do what I always do.

02:25.916 --> 02:27.333
Protect you.

02:31.041 --> 02:33.875
Now, why don't you go have
some lunch with your mom?

02:33.958 --> 02:35.041
Think fast.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.208
I'll be downstairs in my office.

02:48.916 --> 02:50.916
Mommies can be
pretty fun, too, you know.

02:51.416 --> 02:53.000
I bet you didn't know I could do this.

02:59.916 --> 03:01.625
Made you smile.

03:02.916 --> 03:03.916
Come on.

03:04.666 --> 03:07.083
Why don't you go grab the <i>Checkers?</i>
We can liven things up.

03:07.666 --> 03:09.291
-All right. Yeah.
-Yeah?

03:09.375 --> 03:11.208
Okay, I'm going downstairs,
I'll be right back.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.291
Okay.

03:34.541 --> 03:36.166
Mommy!

03:36.250 --> 03:38.583
Mommy? Mommy, what's happening?

03:41.250 --> 03:42.541
Mommy!

03:42.625 --> 03:44.416
Daddy, where are you?

03:55.083 --> 03:56.166
Dad?

04:03.875 --> 04:05.625
Dad. Daddy, where are you?

04:10.166 --> 04:11.375
Mommy!

05:29.125 --> 05:30.125
Kate!

05:30.958 --> 05:32.791
We have to get out of here.

05:36.250 --> 05:39.083
Is Daddy okay?

05:40.041 --> 05:41.041
Dad!

05:43.708 --> 05:45.291
Dad! Dad!

05:45.375 --> 05:46.583
<i>Daddy!</i>

05:53.500 --> 05:54.875
I'm so sorry, my dear.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.291
What if they come back?

06:07.083 --> 06:08.541
They won't come back.

06:11.791 --> 06:13.000
How do you know?

06:17.375 --> 06:19.833
Because the heroes
showed them what would happen.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.916
And even though this is scary,

06:24.125 --> 06:26.750
I'm still the luckiest woman in the world

06:26.833 --> 06:29.708
because I have
the greatest little girl in the world.

06:34.125 --> 06:36.041
Who is not that little.

06:39.375 --> 06:42.041
I need to protect us.

06:42.125 --> 06:43.708
Kate, that's my job.

06:45.791 --> 06:46.833
Okay?

06:46.916 --> 06:50.083
Whatever you need, I'm here for you.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.666
I need a bow and arrow.

08:47.791 --> 08:48.791
Ugh! Come on!

09:23.750 --> 09:25.375
<i>Kate, be careful.</i>

09:25.458 --> 09:28.833
<i>If we get caught, you're definitely</i>
<i>gonna be kicked off the archery team.</i>

09:28.916 --> 09:31.500
Yeah, I know. But a bet's a bet, Greer.

09:32.250 --> 09:35.375
Okay, so the real question.

09:35.458 --> 09:39.541
Does the bell swing back and forth,
or the dangly thingy swing back and forth?

09:39.625 --> 09:41.750
It's obviously the bell.

09:41.833 --> 09:44.458
See? I would disagree.

09:44.541 --> 09:45.916
I think it's the dangly thingy.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.791
<i>Nice outfit by the way, Kate.</i>

09:47.875 --> 09:49.166
Yeah, well,

09:50.083 --> 09:51.958
sometimes, you gotta dress the part.

09:52.041 --> 09:53.166
<i>I know it's a bet,</i>

09:53.250 --> 09:55.333
but are you sure
that arrow won't damage it?

09:56.791 --> 09:57.791
No.

10:10.208 --> 10:12.375
Well, that was a bit of a letdown.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.083
Okay, you know what, just hang on.

10:15.625 --> 10:16.833
Hang on.

10:17.375 --> 10:19.666
Let me just fix this. Give me a second.

10:55.833 --> 10:59.416
Oh, my God!
That was amazing! Wow!

10:59.500 --> 11:00.583
Nice, Kate.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.333
That's fine.

11:09.916 --> 11:13.875
Right? I mean, it gives it character.
All famous bells have cracks in them.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.583
All right, that's, uh, that's not great.

11:18.666 --> 11:20.458
<i>But it could be worse.</i>

11:26.250 --> 11:27.416
This is bad.

11:29.458 --> 11:30.458
Hold it!

13:23.416 --> 13:24.666
Dad?

13:26.333 --> 13:27.333
Dad?

13:32.166 --> 13:33.958
Did you turn your hearing aid off?

13:35.458 --> 13:38.416
No, honey, I know what happens.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.708
I was there.

13:39.791 --> 13:42.041
You know who wasn't there?
Is that guy.

13:42.583 --> 13:43.583
Ant-Man.

13:51.041 --> 13:52.541
You look pretty cool though.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.458
That's a plus.

14:24.916 --> 14:26.083
I'll be right back.

14:55.458 --> 14:56.833
-Hmm.

15:04.541 --> 15:07.416
Oh, uh, a selfie
would be really rad, dude.

15:07.958 --> 15:10.916
My kids would flip.
I mean, you're their absolute favorite.

15:11.541 --> 15:12.791
Yeah, uh...

15:13.916 --> 15:15.833
Now's not really the appropriate time.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.500
Is now a better time?

15:38.041 --> 15:39.166
Wow.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.833
-Hey, are you okay?
-Oh, hey, yeah.

15:48.416 --> 15:51.000
Yeah, yeah. I, uh, just wanted
to come out for some, uh...

15:51.833 --> 15:53.083
Some fresh air, is all.

15:53.166 --> 15:56.833
You know it's fine if you don't
wanna watch the show. I mean...

15:58.000 --> 15:59.708
I know everyone misses her, but...

16:00.708 --> 16:02.458
she was your best friend. It's...

16:04.791 --> 16:06.000
Come here, baby.

16:12.208 --> 16:14.875
This whole thing
is a bit ridiculous, isn't it?

16:14.958 --> 16:16.541
A lot ridiculous.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.750
-The Hulk part was great.
-Yeah, I liked the Hulk.

16:18.833 --> 16:20.125
Hey, Dad. Hey, Lila.

16:20.208 --> 16:22.875
Hey, guys! What's up?
What are you doing here?

16:22.958 --> 16:25.875
Why is everyone singing
and dancing about everything?

16:25.958 --> 16:27.875
I don't know.

16:29.750 --> 16:33.000
But it's Christmas in New York.
And we're out of here. Right?

16:33.083 --> 16:34.458
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

16:34.541 --> 16:36.750
-NATHANIEL: All right.
-Let's show Mom what she's missing.

16:36.833 --> 16:38.875
-NATHANIEL: Yeah.
-Come on, bud.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.250
Hey, Mom!

16:47.333 --> 16:49.125
<i>Hey, honey! I missed you.</i>

16:49.208 --> 16:51.958
<i>-Uh, are you in the city?</i>
-KATE: Yeah, I, uh, I am.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.291
I was gonna stop by my place
and then come see you.

16:54.375 --> 16:57.250
<i>Will you come here first, please?</i>
<i>Jack's over.</i>

16:57.333 --> 16:59.041
<i>I want to talk to you about something.</i>

16:59.125 --> 17:01.291
Okay, uh, okay.
I'll, uh, see you soon, Mom.

17:24.291 --> 17:25.541
Good evening, Miss Bishop.

17:25.625 --> 17:28.208
How's it going? Good?
Wife, kids, all good?

17:28.333 --> 17:30.333
Wonderful, wonderful, Merry Christmas!

17:40.833 --> 17:42.541
-ELEANOR: Hi, sweetie.
-KATE: Hi, Mom.

17:45.375 --> 17:46.750
There you are.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.000
Oh, you look amazing.

17:51.416 --> 17:53.083
What are we looking all fancy for?

17:53.166 --> 17:54.583
Charity auction.

17:54.666 --> 17:56.208
-Ugh.
-I know, right?

17:56.291 --> 17:59.541
All those poor people and nonprofits
relying on the more fortunate.

17:59.625 --> 18:00.958
That is not what I meant.

18:01.041 --> 18:04.041
As much as I love having
you home for the holidays,

18:04.125 --> 18:08.083
I'm not thrilled that I'm about
to replace an irreplaceable clock tower.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.875
It was a bell tower.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.500
The Dean said it had a bell and a clock,

18:12.583 --> 18:15.791
and overachiever that you are,
you managed to destroy both.

18:18.375 --> 18:20.500
What can I do to make it better, Mom?

18:21.333 --> 18:23.666
I started by cancelling your credit cards,

18:23.750 --> 18:27.208
and we're going to have a much longer talk
about this tower that you destroyed,

18:27.291 --> 18:28.291
without joking.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.833
I know young people
think they're invincible,

18:30.916 --> 18:34.083
and rich people think they're invincible
and you've always been both.

18:34.208 --> 18:36.750
So take it from someone
who hasn't, you're not.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.708
You will get hurt.

18:38.791 --> 18:41.000
So please, don't go out looking for it.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.541
Sorry, Mom.

18:48.041 --> 18:49.041
Sorry.

18:50.416 --> 18:51.750
Okay.

18:52.291 --> 18:54.333
You get that from your father, you know.

18:54.875 --> 18:57.416
Why don't you start making it up to me

18:57.500 --> 19:01.083
by putting on that red dress in
your bedroom and coming with me tonight?

19:04.125 --> 19:05.666
All right, well, um,

19:07.166 --> 19:08.666
on another note,

19:11.625 --> 19:13.166
I got a new one for the case.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.791
U.S. Open Martial Art Championship.

19:19.500 --> 19:23.875
You're amazing. I still remember
when you got your black belt at 15.

19:24.666 --> 19:28.041
We might have to retire some from
when you were little to make room. Huh?

19:28.125 --> 19:30.375
-I like those.
-ELEANOR: I do, too, hon.

19:30.458 --> 19:31.500
I do, too.

19:35.416 --> 19:37.416
What's with all the swords, Mom?

19:38.833 --> 19:43.083
Hon, uh, there have been a few changes
while you were away this semester.

19:43.625 --> 19:44.625
Ta-da!

19:44.708 --> 19:45.708
Jack?

19:45.791 --> 19:47.458
Oh.

19:47.541 --> 19:49.541
What an unexpected surprise.

19:49.625 --> 19:51.791
All surprises are unexpected.

19:51.875 --> 19:53.958
That can't be right. Is it?

19:54.625 --> 19:55.916
Nice to see you again, Katie.

19:59.625 --> 20:00.875
That was in your mouth.

20:00.958 --> 20:03.208
So it was.

20:03.916 --> 20:06.958
We cannot be late, so go change.

20:07.041 --> 20:09.958
Meet us at the hotel
and we'll talk there. Okay?

20:10.041 --> 20:11.333
-Shall we?
-Let's.

20:11.416 --> 20:12.708
We'll see you at the party.

20:12.791 --> 20:14.291
See you there, honey.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.583
Lots more to talk about.

20:22.666 --> 20:24.916
You look like a maniac.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.500
You're a total crazy person.

20:28.833 --> 20:30.041
Is anybody else hungry?

20:30.125 --> 20:32.958
For some more, like, some more crabs
or maybe get four more crabs?

20:33.041 --> 20:34.875
-What do you think?
-Yes. I could eat three.

20:34.958 --> 20:36.083
-No.
-COOPER: Come on, Dad,

20:36.166 --> 20:38.041
you ordered food for 30 people.

20:38.125 --> 20:40.333
You're going to puke if you have any more.

20:40.416 --> 20:43.583
And if he pukes,
you two are cleaning it up.

20:43.666 --> 20:44.916
I'm not cleaning it up.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.958
Hey, you know what?
You know what's right down the street?

20:48.666 --> 20:52.125
The Christmas tree.
The biggest one you'll see in your life.

20:52.208 --> 20:54.458
It's enormous!
You want to see that after this?

20:54.541 --> 20:56.000
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Let's go.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.625
-Oh, wait, wait, wait.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.666
Momma callin'. Momma's calling. Say "Hi!"

21:00.750 --> 21:02.458
-Hi, Mom!
-Hi, Momma!

21:02.541 --> 21:05.166
Hey, guys! How are ya?

21:05.250 --> 21:06.708
I miss you so much!

21:06.791 --> 21:09.625
-We miss you, too.
-LAURA: <i>How was the show?</i>

21:10.708 --> 21:13.666
It was, uh-- It's over. It was big.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.666
-We left halfway through.
-There you go.

21:15.750 --> 21:16.875
Oh, no!

21:17.416 --> 21:18.750
You guys all good?

21:18.833 --> 21:20.916
<i>Uh, yeah,</i>
<i>it'd be easier if you were here.</i>

21:21.000 --> 21:23.125
I'd be less likely to strangle these kids.

21:23.208 --> 21:25.500
<i>The whole point was for you</i>
<i>to spend time with the kids.</i>

21:25.583 --> 21:28.458
No, I'm kidding.
We're having a really good time.

21:28.541 --> 21:30.333
-We miss you.
-I miss you.

21:30.416 --> 21:32.875
-I can't wait to see you guys tomorrow.
-LILA: <i>Bye, Mom!</i>

21:33.416 --> 21:35.416
-LILA: Bye, Mom! Love you!
-Bye, Mom.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.416
-Talk to you later. See you soon.
-NATHANIEL: Bye-bye.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.375
Well, look, it's six days
until Christmas, okay?

21:40.458 --> 21:43.666
We're gonna do a lot of activities.
What's your favorite one?

21:43.750 --> 21:45.291
-Um, gingerbread house.
-We're doing that!

21:45.375 --> 21:46.458
What do you got?

21:46.541 --> 21:48.666
Uh, Christmas movie marathon.

21:48.750 --> 21:50.000
Movie marathon, awesome!

21:50.083 --> 21:52.541
-Uh, ugly sweaters.
-Ugly Christmas sweaters!

21:52.625 --> 21:55.583
We have to decorate the tree.
There's a thousand things to do.

21:55.666 --> 21:57.875
It's going to be amazing,
but most important thing,

21:57.958 --> 22:00.166
we're going to do it all together.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.791
No. Not holding their hands.

22:01.875 --> 22:03.291
Hold your brothers' hands.

22:04.541 --> 22:05.791
I love you guys.

22:05.875 --> 22:06.875
Love you, too.

22:06.958 --> 22:09.208
It's going to be
the best Barton Christmas ever!

22:09.291 --> 22:10.291
All right?

22:12.416 --> 22:13.500
-Please.
-Yeah.

22:13.583 --> 22:14.708
Dinner is on us.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.666
-Thank you.
-Oh, that's, that's not necessary.

22:17.750 --> 22:20.291
It's necessary. You saved our city.

22:20.916 --> 22:22.875
Oh. Thank you.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.208
Thank you, sir.

22:26.291 --> 22:28.000
-NATHANIEL: Thank you!
-COOPER: Thank you.

22:41.291 --> 22:42.750
Uh, get back to work.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.375
-Excuse me dear, would you--
-Sorry, I'm not a waitress.

22:54.458 --> 22:56.000
You're the little Bishop girl.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.750
Yes, I am.

22:57.833 --> 23:02.000
-Armand. Armand Duquesne.
-Ah.

23:02.083 --> 23:04.750
You used to come to my brownstone
for brunch.

23:04.833 --> 23:06.500
Oh, build your own blintz bar.

23:06.833 --> 23:08.458
Precisely.

23:09.041 --> 23:10.625
You know, it's unfair.

23:10.708 --> 23:14.916
I never looked
that good in a tuxedo in my life.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.375
I'd appreciate it if you wear something
a little more lady-like for the wedding,

23:18.458 --> 23:19.875
so we won't be competing.

23:20.458 --> 23:21.708
What wedding?

23:21.791 --> 23:22.916
You don't know?

23:23.958 --> 23:25.291
Eleanor and Jack.

23:25.416 --> 23:29.666
Oh! Those secretive little love birds!

23:32.666 --> 23:35.583
-WAITER: Can I offer you some champagne?
-Thank you!

23:35.708 --> 23:40.458
Believe me, I've done everything
in my power to talk him out of it.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.666
When he gets something
set in that little mind of his,

23:44.750 --> 23:46.875
he can be quite determined.

23:47.791 --> 23:48.791
Oh.

23:49.541 --> 23:51.291
Seems like he won the jackpot.

23:51.375 --> 23:52.541
You think so?

23:53.208 --> 23:54.708
So does he.

23:54.791 --> 23:56.416
I'm not so sure.

23:59.833 --> 24:01.875
Armand, I wanna go home. I'm bored.

24:01.958 --> 24:05.125
That's no way to talk, Armand.
That's not the way you were brought up.

24:05.208 --> 24:07.041
Come and say hello to Miss Bishop.

24:08.083 --> 24:09.375
Hey.

24:09.458 --> 24:10.458
Hello.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.625
Another Armand, I see.

24:12.708 --> 24:16.541
Yes. I'm Armand the third
and he's Armand the seventh.

24:16.625 --> 24:18.583
I believe that's quite sufficient.

24:18.666 --> 24:23.666
Well, uh, I'm gonna
make my excuses because it seems that

24:23.750 --> 24:26.791
you need to have a chat

24:27.875 --> 24:30.208
with your prize of a mother.

24:31.666 --> 24:34.166
Come on, Armand. Come on, boy!

24:52.666 --> 24:53.666
You're engaged?

24:53.750 --> 24:56.458
Oh, well, I guess
the beans are out of the bag.

24:58.833 --> 25:01.041
Well, can we have a little moment?

25:01.166 --> 25:04.083
Oh, of course, it's almost time
for my other engagement anyway.

25:04.166 --> 25:05.166
Bye.

25:10.125 --> 25:14.083
Babe, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry you found out this way.

25:14.166 --> 25:16.416
I don't know, Mom, this is just like...

25:16.958 --> 25:19.250
-Fast.
-Yeah, yeah, it's fast, yes.

25:19.333 --> 25:22.541
But, you know, it's kind of nice
being swept up in the romance of it.

25:23.416 --> 25:26.125
Is there a part of you
that could be happy for me?

25:28.750 --> 25:30.041
Yes.

25:30.125 --> 25:31.583
Yes, Mom, of course.

25:33.125 --> 25:36.333
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I wanted to tell you first. I'm sorry.

25:37.166 --> 25:39.416
-I'm going to get some air, Mom.
-I understand.

25:39.500 --> 25:40.666
Yep.

25:40.750 --> 25:43.125
-Come back and find me, okay?
-KATE: Yeah.

26:04.791 --> 26:06.916
-Hi.

26:08.291 --> 26:09.958
Heck of a party, huh?

26:27.416 --> 26:30.291
I should've known
that this empire of yours

26:30.375 --> 26:32.083
would be built on a lie.

26:32.208 --> 26:35.791
By myself from the ground up.
So whatever you think you saw is not true.

26:35.875 --> 26:37.500
Don't insult my intelligence.

26:37.625 --> 26:39.333
You're frankly insulting us both.

26:39.416 --> 26:41.416
-I know what I saw.
-You are all just--

26:41.500 --> 26:43.916
Don't you try that on me.

26:45.958 --> 26:48.583
I gave you an opportunity
to explain yourself.

26:48.666 --> 26:50.291
I don't want to argue with you.

26:50.375 --> 26:55.208
I've got powerful friends, too.
The kind you don't want to mess with.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Please.

26:57.208 --> 26:58.208
Armand!

27:03.666 --> 27:05.541
See you at Christmas dinner.

27:08.333 --> 27:10.416
Mom, what was that about?
Is that guy threatening you?

27:10.500 --> 27:13.416
I honestly-- I have no idea.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.333
Why are you lurking in the hallways?

27:15.416 --> 27:17.916
-KATE: I was outside getting air.
-Come back to the party.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.416
-KATE: Okay. All right.
-Okay.

27:19.875 --> 27:21.750
-KATE: Be right there.
-ELEANOR: All right.

27:41.041 --> 27:42.500
-Be right back.
-Okay.

27:56.666 --> 27:58.666
Gary wants you to bring
these down, right away.

27:58.750 --> 28:00.166
-Just these two?
-These two.

28:47.583 --> 28:48.791
This seat is taken.

28:53.833 --> 28:57.333
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be seated, and we will begin.

28:57.416 --> 29:00.125
I've reached
my breaking point with your fiancée.

29:01.208 --> 29:04.041
Things are about to get very ugly.

29:04.125 --> 29:06.625
Why don't we leave Eleanor alone,
you old goat.

29:07.875 --> 29:10.000
For our first item
of the evening,

29:10.083 --> 29:12.833
we will be traveling back in time.

29:12.916 --> 29:17.291
We'll start the bidding for this
magnificent skull at $2 million.

29:17.375 --> 29:18.541
Do I hear $2 million?

29:18.625 --> 29:20.583
<i>Bidder bidder,</i> two-point-one.

29:20.666 --> 29:22.583
I got $2 million,
do I hear two-point-one?

29:22.666 --> 29:25.458
Two-point-one, thank you so much, sir.
Do I hear two-point-two?

29:25.541 --> 29:27.458
-Do I hear two-point-two?
-Excuse me?

29:28.125 --> 29:29.250
Hey, excuse me!

29:31.375 --> 29:32.458
Oh, perfect!

29:34.000 --> 29:35.166
-Oh.
-Great.

29:35.708 --> 29:37.666
I was supposed
to be the only one working here.

29:38.875 --> 29:42.166
Gary? Gary sent me to work here.

29:43.208 --> 29:45.458
So maybe if you want to bother Gary...

29:47.083 --> 29:49.166
You're doing great. Okay.

29:50.083 --> 29:51.875
Two million seven,
now two million eight.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.125
I've got two million seven
right here, going once.

29:54.791 --> 29:57.166
I've got two-point-seven going twice.

29:58.291 --> 30:01.208
Sold for $2.7 million.

30:01.291 --> 30:05.916
Thank you. And I will remind you
that this is for home display only.

30:06.458 --> 30:09.083
And you have no idea where you got it.

30:13.958 --> 30:15.541
Who told you to come down here?

30:16.583 --> 30:17.625
Gary.

30:18.333 --> 30:19.791
I'm Gary.

30:20.208 --> 30:21.208
What's your name?

30:21.833 --> 30:23.958
You see that's the problem, Gary,

30:25.000 --> 30:26.666
you don't even know my name.

30:27.500 --> 30:30.750
You know, uh, this is,
this is not gonna work out. I quit.

30:30.833 --> 30:33.000
You can't quit. Hold on.

30:37.958 --> 30:39.208
Where did she go?

30:39.916 --> 30:41.291
Excuse me.

31:02.833 --> 31:04.291
Come on, let's go. Move.

31:04.625 --> 31:05.875
Don't forget your positions.

31:06.958 --> 31:08.208
Mine's on the left.

31:08.291 --> 31:09.291
Yeah, bro.

31:10.208 --> 31:11.208
Get ready.

31:13.750 --> 31:16.208
Up next,
we have a very special piece.

31:16.291 --> 31:20.500
An artifact recovered from
the wreckage of the Avengers compound.

31:21.125 --> 31:25.541
Now you may recall the Ronin decimated
the criminal underworld of the city,

31:25.625 --> 31:31.166
almost completely annihilating the status
and power of the head of organized crime.

31:31.250 --> 31:35.083
The Ronin brought
a brutal form of justice to his victims,

31:35.166 --> 31:39.916
and his identity continues
to remain a mystery to this very day.

31:40.458 --> 31:44.666
Now you can own
this one-of-a-kind retractable sword,

31:44.750 --> 31:47.375
and we'll start the bidding at $200,000.

31:47.458 --> 31:49.833
Do I hear $200,000? $200,000,

31:49.916 --> 31:51.750
<i>bidder bidder,</i> do I hear $250,000?

31:51.833 --> 31:54.208
$250,000, thank you, sir.
Do I hear $300,000?

31:54.291 --> 31:56.500
$300,000, looking for $350,000.

31:56.583 --> 31:58.166
What are you doing, you dope?

31:59.125 --> 32:00.750
I'm buying that sword.

32:00.833 --> 32:03.208
You don't have 300 grand.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.291
No, but I'll inherit it one day, won't I?

32:08.833 --> 32:11.041
-$350,000.
-$350,000, right here in the front.

32:11.125 --> 32:14.250
Do we go to $400,000?
Let's go to four. Four, thank you so much.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.625
At $400,000, do I hear $450,000?

32:21.541 --> 32:22.708
Moving to two.

32:22.791 --> 32:24.125
Okay, everybody ready?

32:32.583 --> 32:34.541
$440,000, do I hear $450,000?

32:34.625 --> 32:37.333
$450,000 up front. Looking for $475,000.

32:38.083 --> 32:39.333
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.

32:39.416 --> 32:42.000
This sword belonged to the infamous Ronin.

32:43.166 --> 32:44.541
$475,000.

32:44.625 --> 32:46.833
$475,000, <i>bidder bidder,</i>
do I hear $500,000?

32:46.916 --> 32:49.291
I've got $475,000 here, it's going once.

32:50.583 --> 32:52.500
$475,000 is going twice.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.958
Sold for $475,000.

32:57.041 --> 32:59.708
Up next, we have lot number 3-0-9.

32:59.791 --> 33:03.000
The companion piece, the Ronin suit.

33:53.833 --> 33:55.333
Help! Please help!

33:55.416 --> 33:57.041
Security!

33:57.625 --> 33:59.166
We're stuck in here!

34:01.208 --> 34:03.041
We've got 90 seconds
to find the watch.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.750
Everything else is secondary.

34:04.833 --> 34:05.833
Let's go, bro.

34:05.916 --> 34:08.166
-MAN 3: Spread out. Let's go, let's go.

34:09.708 --> 34:11.041
Find the watch!

34:30.625 --> 34:32.333
Where is it? Where is it?

34:32.416 --> 34:34.250
Come on! We're running out of time!

34:35.958 --> 34:37.083
Come on. Let's go.

34:43.291 --> 34:44.375
Grab my hand!

34:45.125 --> 34:46.833
I can't see.

34:48.458 --> 34:50.083
Do you know who I am?

35:00.708 --> 35:01.708
Hello.

35:06.125 --> 35:08.333
Quick, hurry!
Everyone get out of here!

35:08.416 --> 35:12.500
I see him! I see him, there!

35:23.875 --> 35:25.000
Okay.

35:26.541 --> 35:27.583
Come on, Kate.

35:36.416 --> 35:37.416
He disappeared!

35:37.916 --> 35:39.458
I'm telling you, it was the Ronin!

35:40.791 --> 35:42.958
He's here somewhere, bro!
Keep looking!

35:43.041 --> 35:44.041
Oh, shit!

36:14.041 --> 36:15.208
He's getting away!

36:18.833 --> 36:19.833
Darling!

36:20.541 --> 36:23.000
-Where's Kate? She won't answer the phone.
-I don't know.

36:23.083 --> 36:24.875
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

36:24.958 --> 36:26.000
Yeah. I'm fine.

36:44.875 --> 36:46.250
-Ronin?

37:34.416 --> 37:36.833
The watch. I found it.

37:38.666 --> 37:40.125
Hey!

37:41.458 --> 37:42.750
Get off me!

37:42.833 --> 37:44.833
I'm gonna get you, you dumb dog!

37:44.916 --> 37:46.916
-Ow! Aah!

37:47.000 --> 37:48.166
I kill you!

37:49.333 --> 37:50.500
Hey!

37:53.041 --> 37:54.875
-KATE: Wait!

38:00.125 --> 38:02.583
Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

38:03.166 --> 38:05.583
-Oh, wait! Wait! No, no, no.

38:20.583 --> 38:22.708
Kazi! Kazi!

38:22.791 --> 38:24.583
-We gotta go!
-MAN 2: Let's go, bro!

38:25.208 --> 38:27.375
Kazi! We go now! Come on!

38:28.833 --> 38:30.666
Let's get to the van
and go after her.

38:41.916 --> 38:45.166
You were right about the tree, Dad.
It was amazing.

38:45.250 --> 38:46.708
I want one that big.

38:46.791 --> 38:48.458
It wouldn't fit
in our house, dummy.

38:48.541 --> 38:50.708
Please, please, please?

38:50.791 --> 38:53.375
It's a little late for TV, guys.
I've gotta pack.

38:55.125 --> 38:56.416
Ay, ay, ay.

38:57.083 --> 38:59.166
<i>We are following a breaking news story.</i>

38:59.250 --> 39:02.375
<i>A high society gala rocked by an explosion</i>

39:02.500 --> 39:06.333
<i>when it went off at Park Avenue</i>
<i>and 68th Street tonight.</i>

39:06.416 --> 39:08.875
<i>The cause of the explosion</i>
<i>is still under investigation.</i>

39:08.958 --> 39:13.708
<i>But witnesses captured cell phone footage</i>
<i>of a masked assailant fleeing the scene.</i>

39:15.458 --> 39:16.458
Check it out.

39:17.041 --> 39:18.791
A ninja saved a dog.

39:18.875 --> 39:21.750
<i>Authorities believe</i>
<i>the assailant could be the Ronin...</i>

39:21.833 --> 39:23.333
Isn't that awesome, Dad?

39:23.416 --> 39:26.083
<i>...who terrorized</i>
<i>organized crime in New York and elsewhere.</i>

39:38.375 --> 39:42.375
<i>This is the first</i>
<i>potential sighting of the Ronin in years.</i>

39:46.250 --> 39:47.541
Welcome to my apartment.

39:47.666 --> 39:50.166
Whoa. Okay, that was, that was crazy.

39:50.250 --> 39:53.000
But we're safe. We're safe.

39:53.083 --> 39:55.541
Okay, what is going on with Armand?

39:55.625 --> 39:58.416
Threatening my mom
and buying black market swords?

39:58.500 --> 40:00.875
Do you think he's connected
to the break-in somehow?

40:03.916 --> 40:06.375
-Food. You want food. Uh, of course. Oh.

40:06.458 --> 40:07.541
Uh...

40:08.208 --> 40:10.083
Okay, listen. Just hang on.

40:10.166 --> 40:12.416
I'm gonna... I'm gonna get you some food.

40:12.500 --> 40:13.500
Uh...

40:14.500 --> 40:16.208
Pizza? You want some pizza?

40:16.291 --> 40:17.291
Okay.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.875
Have some. Go on.

40:19.958 --> 40:21.583
Good boy. Wow.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.708
You like pizza.

40:25.333 --> 40:27.875
I've got to figure out
what's up with Armand.

40:31.083 --> 40:32.083
Okay.

40:34.458 --> 40:35.875
Do not destroy this apartment.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.083
Monogrammed butterscotch?

42:16.250 --> 42:17.250
Armand?

42:18.083 --> 42:19.166
Oh, God!

42:22.125 --> 42:23.125
Mr. Duquesne?

42:23.208 --> 42:25.208
I have your dry cleaning,
and I brought dinner.

42:54.958 --> 42:58.250
Where do you think you're going?
We only want to talk.

42:58.333 --> 43:01.083
Hey,
we got little surprise for you.

43:01.166 --> 43:03.083
We've got eyes everywhere.

43:03.791 --> 43:05.291
We missed you, Ronin.

43:08.250 --> 43:09.833
We got you now, bro.

43:10.583 --> 43:12.625
Why you makin' it so tough on us, bro?

44:16.208 --> 44:17.291
Sorry.

44:32.708 --> 44:33.875
Oh, come on.

44:41.708 --> 44:42.833
Come on!

44:43.541 --> 44:45.125
You're... You're Hawkeye!

44:45.833 --> 44:47.583
And who the hell are you?
