00:15.140 --> 00:16.558
Shit!

00:17.684 --> 00:18.810
What was that?

00:18.977 --> 00:20.145
If you're a rapist,

00:20.645 --> 00:22.647
it's 500 pages of pure gold.

00:22.897 --> 00:24.733
Thousands have been sold.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.483
Who knows how many have ended up
in the wrong hands.

00:30.822 --> 00:33.366
Uh, I'm looking for Detective Rasmussen.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.576
That's it.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.288
That's my big haul from Kansas.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.540
Sign in, hon. I'm gonna need ID.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.208
Officers.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.135
Please tell me you had better luck
around here.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.090
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:49.424 --> 00:50.800
Fucking asshole!

00:50.884 --> 00:51.968
Let go of me!

00:52.052 --> 00:54.387
- Hey! Get this on your phone!
- Ma'am.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.932
It was right there in my garden
the whole time.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.643
The exact knife that the attacker held
to my throat.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.479
How could you people not have found that?

01:02.562 --> 01:03.980
It was just complete fucking luck

01:04.063 --> 01:05.904
that I happened to go out back
and mulch today.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.901
I told them he had a knife.

01:08.193 --> 01:11.362
That Harkness never believed
a word I said.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.406
No one is questioning your credibility.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.909
I'm not even gonna engage on that one.

01:15.992 --> 01:19.079
Just tell me how he could have missed
this that night?

01:19.162 --> 01:22.165
Isn't it, like, Cop 101?
Check the backyard.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.667
If you're suggesting
that cops fuck up sometimes,

01:24.751 --> 01:28.046
that they ignore evidence
or dismiss victims 'cause they're lazy

01:28.129 --> 01:30.507
or burnt out, or maybe they just
don't like women that much,

01:30.590 --> 01:32.217
you'll get no argument from me.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.094
But that's not what's happening.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.054
Right now, you're talking to the cops

01:36.137 --> 01:38.181
who went back to your case
and reopened it.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.183
We are working it, hard.

01:41.392 --> 01:42.685
You got a suspect?

01:44.896 --> 01:45.896
Not yet.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.314
Figures.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.862
And we will go back to your place,
and we will conduct a thorough search.

01:52.946 --> 01:56.950
We will conduct a grid search of your yard
and every yard adjacent to your house.

01:57.575 --> 01:58.785
Whoop-de-fucking-do.

01:58.868 --> 02:01.204
That's what you shoulda done
the first time around.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.220
Fucking idiotic, missing this.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.222
You know,

02:20.682 --> 02:23.518
looking through those eight years of files
out in Kansas...

02:24.644 --> 02:25.937
you see the pattern.

02:26.813 --> 02:27.813
There's a rape,

02:28.231 --> 02:29.732
there's a rush of police work,

02:30.024 --> 02:31.609
new evidence, new leads.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.069
And then one by one...

02:33.987 --> 02:34.988
they dry up.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.324
And six weeks later,
you're back where you started...

02:38.783 --> 02:40.160
with nothing but dead ends,

02:40.243 --> 02:42.620
nothing to go on, nothing to pursue...

02:44.581 --> 02:45.915
until he hits again.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.502
I don't want that to happen here.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.879
Eh, nobody does.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.716
I don't want another batch
of useful information,

02:55.133 --> 02:56.634
another DNA sample.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.052
I do not want that.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.600
How about instead of freaking out here
in front of everyone,

03:03.683 --> 03:08.062
you go log that knife into evidence
and just get back to work?

03:10.565 --> 03:12.400
Come on.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.386
Hi, it's Detective Duvall.

03:14.444 --> 03:18.198
I'm checking in again
to see if you've seen a white Mazda.

03:20.074 --> 03:21.074
No.

03:21.910 --> 03:22.744
Okay.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.591
- Thanks, Detective.
- Thank you.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.500
Jesus! Elias, what the fuck?

03:29.584 --> 03:31.836
Oh, sorry. It's the suspicious vehicles.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.381
I decided to enlarge the map
so I could really pinpoint the locations.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.466
What?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.552
This is James Massey,

03:39.636 --> 03:42.722
the cop who was on both the military
and domestic violence lists.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.766
I got his cell number.
What can you do with it?

03:45.516 --> 03:47.268
A couple of things come to mind.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.647
Do the one you can keep most quiet.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.237
Okay. Thanks for keeping an eye out.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.783
Hi, it's Detective Duvall.
I'm calling again about the white Mazda.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.330
Yeah, I'm still looking for that Mazda
with the broken mirror.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.917
All right, uh...

04:12.377 --> 04:14.504
well, you know where to find me if you do.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.138
Come on in, Marie.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.473
Sit.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.892
Sit, sit, sit.

04:29.686 --> 04:34.607
Okay. So, I got you something called
a pretrial diversion,

04:34.691 --> 04:36.442
which is a good thing.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.296
If you keep your nose clean,
then all this goes away in a year.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.655
Your record gets expunged.

04:42.323 --> 04:45.159
Uh, it... it'll be like, uh,
it never happened.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.723
There are some terms,
but all of them are easy.

04:49.747 --> 04:52.417
Number one:
you'll be on, uh, supervised probation.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.396
You'll have a probation officer
you'll have to check in with once a month.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.006
Now, he can visit you at your home
without warning.

04:58.089 --> 05:01.592
So, you've got to be careful.
No drugs, no booze. I mean...

05:02.468 --> 05:05.013
they haven't ordered drug testing,
but they could.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.849
Number two: mandatory therapy.
You go down to the clinic,

05:07.932 --> 05:09.372
they'll assign you a nice therapist,

05:09.434 --> 05:11.769
you'll talk about why you filed
a false report.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.523
And, uh, it doesn't matter,
you gotta go.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.735
Number three:
you pay $500 to cover the costs

05:18.818 --> 05:21.738
that the city incurred, and... that's it.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.285
Any questions?

05:31.622 --> 05:32.623
Uh...

05:34.459 --> 05:35.626
I... I don't think so.

05:39.881 --> 05:40.881
Look...

05:42.467 --> 05:45.219
this is a good deal.
It's as good as we're gonna get.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.223
You should feel really good about this.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.478
Five hundred dollars?

05:54.520 --> 05:57.148
- It's my turn.
- I can pay you back with interest.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.192
- Ow, stop!
- That's not the point.

05:59.275 --> 06:02.695
- Give it back, Nadia.
- Nadia. Three, two, one.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.992
- You always take his side.
- Upstairs and in pajamas, both of you.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.076
Now.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.415
I know it's a lot of money.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.959
It would help me
if I knew what it was for.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.296
I'd really rather not say.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.465
Are you pregnant?

06:23.591 --> 06:26.761
N... no. Uh... Oh, my God. No.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.179
Well, I don't know.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.433
No. d... do...
do I have to tell you everything?

06:32.517 --> 06:34.727
No, but you can't have it
both ways.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.688
Either you take care of this yourself,

06:37.772 --> 06:39.190
or you want me to help you.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.692
In which case,
I'm gonna have some questions.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.445
Just never mind. I'll deal with it.

06:44.987 --> 06:45.987
Here's what I'd do.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.658
I'd ask for an advance
on your paycheck from Norris.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.160
Most businesses will do that
once or twice.

06:52.995 --> 06:53.995
What?

06:54.497 --> 06:57.166
I... I actually don't work there anymore.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.672
- What?
- Since when?

07:03.589 --> 07:06.217
They moved me off the floor
for... for no reason.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.510
Oh, my God, Marie.

07:08.386 --> 07:11.722
No, you don't...
My... My boss was being a total a-hole...

07:11.806 --> 07:13.182
Why would you lie to me?

07:13.266 --> 07:17.019
Now every time you say something,
I'm gonna ask myself, is she lying?

07:19.939 --> 07:23.067
I didn't lie.
I just didn't mention it.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.695
Oh, don't give me that.
It's the same thing.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.697
- Not in my opinion.
- Okay, well,

07:28.072 --> 07:30.783
how about these charges
they're filing against you?

07:31.075 --> 07:33.786
Was that another thing
you just forgot to mention?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.430
Were you ever gonna tell me about that?

07:38.624 --> 07:41.461
- How did you hear about that?
- That's not the point.

07:43.004 --> 07:43.921
I tell you, Marie,

07:44.005 --> 07:47.341
if you were ever wondering what
spinning out of control looks like...

07:47.675 --> 07:50.261
this... this is what it looks like.

07:59.770 --> 08:03.566
You know, if it makes you feel any better,
I need the money to pay my court fine.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.155
I'm gonna plead guilty,
so they drop the charges.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.116
I got a lawyer.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.076
He worked it out.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.582
I have to see a probation officer
once a month,

08:19.665 --> 08:21.292
and I have mandatory counseling.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.504
Well, maybe this could end up
being a good thing.

08:25.796 --> 08:28.674
You know, sometimes the system
actually works.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.125
Hey.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.420
Hope you're hungry.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.466
They had a special on ribs.
I went a little crazy.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.302
Thanks for cooking.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.056
Uh...

09:19.392 --> 09:20.726
I got something for you.

09:20.810 --> 09:21.810
What?

09:23.729 --> 09:24.772
It's on the table.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.575
Oh, man.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.787
I always thought guys who said,

09:39.870 --> 09:42.430
"Sometimes you gotta do the wrong thing
to do the right thing"...

09:42.582 --> 09:43.416
were full of shit.

09:43.499 --> 09:46.711
But I looked him up.
You're right. He's bad news.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.072
Now, maybe that's the only way
to get to the root of things.

09:51.799 --> 09:54.010
Bending the rules, working in the margins.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.390
Or maybe I'm full of shit too.

10:00.641 --> 10:01.641
I don't know.

10:01.934 --> 10:02.934
Anyway...

10:03.894 --> 10:07.481
if that's your guy, you need to get him
off the streets, like, now.

10:59.116 --> 11:02.244
So, here's what I'm thinking
on my drive in.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.039
I'm thinking, what's up with the pictures?

11:05.122 --> 11:06.767
- What pictures?
- The ones he takes.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.669
We've been talking about them
like they're souvenirs.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.337
What if they're not?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.130
What else would they be?

11:13.214 --> 11:16.592
Well...
...they're graphic sexual imagery.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.554
One thing you need a lot
of graphic sexual imagery for is...

11:20.638 --> 11:21.722
Porn sites.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.350
I say we run searches.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.019
We type in rape, bondage, porn...

11:27.770 --> 11:29.855
start scanning the sites for our victims.

11:32.858 --> 11:36.529
So, I took the data dumps
from each of the cell towers

11:36.612 --> 11:38.447
closest to the four crime scenes

11:38.531 --> 11:40.866
for the two-hour period
before the assaults

11:40.950 --> 11:42.785
and ran Massey's number...

11:44.412 --> 11:46.580
- through each of the dumps.
- And?

11:49.291 --> 11:50.710
Officer Massey

11:51.168 --> 11:55.381
was within a half-mile radius
of Golden and Lakewood the night of.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.260
Obviously,
these are approximate locations.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.513
What about the other two nights?
Doris and Sarah.

12:02.930 --> 12:03.931
Nothing.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.145
That doesn't mean he wasn't there.
Just means he didn't make any calls.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.732
Plus, this doesn't prove a damn thing.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.609
There's a million good reasons
he could be in those areas.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.404
Yeah, and one bad one.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.431
Put a body on that fucking guy.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.084
No, no! Moving pick. Where's the whistle?

12:32.168 --> 12:35.838
- Same thing happened in Wednesday's game.
- What do they have against Ford?

12:36.672 --> 12:38.507
You gotta call that.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.842
It's incidental.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.682
Do you have fucking eyes?
He's totally hand-checking him.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.392
Someone knows their game.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.688
Started at point for Colorado State.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.607
Were you any good?

12:55.691 --> 12:58.569
All-Conference in the old Western,
three consecutive seasons.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.111
Not four?

13:00.237 --> 13:01.989
Nah, I didn't play my final year.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.073
Knee surgery.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.544
How about we watch the rest of the game
back at my place?

13:17.922 --> 13:19.507
I live right around the corner.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.221
Only if we can watch SportsCenter after.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.270
I got it.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.688
Tommy.

13:39.693 --> 13:42.196
- Y'all have a good night.
- No, no. Leave that.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.950
My lady friend here
is gonna want that bottle.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.287
Isn't that right, Detective?

13:52.581 --> 13:55.125
No, no, no, no.
Please, go ahead and take it.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.379
You can have as much of my DNA
as you want.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.300
Here's a little extra
in case they fuck up in the lab.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.475
You don't want to fuck with me, Grace.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.603
I have a lot more friends than you do...

14:18.440 --> 14:19.650
in higher places.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.861
Enjoy the game.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.385
Excuse us. Thank you.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.851
Hey, you're gonna do great. All right?

14:56.061 --> 14:58.105
Number 37, window two.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.403
Hi, I'm 37.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.324
- You here with a parent?
- No. It's just me.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.407
Oh.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.137
When the light changes,
make the left when you can.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.961
Miss?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.295
Miss?

16:11.387 --> 16:12.387
Um...

16:15.015 --> 16:16.952
- I'm sorry.
- W... what the hell were you thinking?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.644
I'm sorry. I... I... I'm...

16:19.395 --> 16:20.395
Um...

16:20.562 --> 16:21.814
I was just...

16:22.523 --> 16:23.774
You wanna take a minute?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.027
Mi... Miss. Miss?

17:14.907 --> 17:16.201

18:16.303 --> 18:19.098

18:19.973 --> 18:21.100
It's not a fake ID.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.814
How much are the Pringles?

18:41.411 --> 18:42.496
Whoa.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.541
Whoa.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.960
- Fuck you.
- You fuck you.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.672
Hi, uh, c... could you...
could you buy me a 40?

18:51.755 --> 18:54.967
Um, I can, but I choose not to.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.262
Well, you can keep the change.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.806

19:00.889 --> 19:02.307
Hey, don't be dick.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.851
Just buy her the beer.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.144

19:41.805 --> 19:42.848
You're hungry, right?

19:43.682 --> 19:44.682
I'll do whatever.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.935
- Yeah.
- Hey, she'll do whatever.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.354

in a parking lot to buy you beer.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.616
Then I wouldn't have any beer.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.329
Seriously, we could have abducted you
or some shit.

20:05.412 --> 20:08.332

20:37.986 --> 20:41.156
Make sure CBI compares the DNA off this
with our case samples.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.117
It's not gonna match,
but they should run it anyway.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.625
Whenever you're ready, Detective.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.637
Uh, we ran the Lakewood knife.

21:03.720 --> 21:07.724
No prints or DNA. Redid grid searches
on all four crime scenes.

21:08.684 --> 21:09.851
Nothing there either.

21:10.644 --> 21:11.644
Sorry.

21:12.312 --> 21:16.275
Um, went through the case files
in the Kansas rapes.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.820
I can't rule out the possibility
that it's the same guy, but...

21:21.029 --> 21:22.864
nothing says that it is either.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.951
Have you searched burglary
and trespassing reports

21:26.034 --> 21:27.286
in neighboring jurisdictions

21:27.369 --> 21:30.080
to see if any of these
can be reclassified as rapes?

21:30.163 --> 21:34.084
In all ten districts of Jefferson
and Adams counties, multiple times.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.169
Is there anything I can release
to the press?

21:36.253 --> 21:38.630
I mean, I got these guys calling me
two, three times a day.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.358
- Like?
- Identifying features.

21:40.382 --> 21:41.550
Articles of clothing.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.344
As soon as we have something,
we'll let you know, Sergeant.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.973
But we don't. That's the thing,
we don't have anything.

21:48.348 --> 21:51.601
Well, that's not true. We have DNA
from three out of four crime scenes...

21:51.685 --> 21:53.645
No, we have a shit ton of information.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.606
We know everything about this guy.
We know his height, his weight,

21:56.690 --> 21:58.275
color of his eyes, color of his hair.

21:58.358 --> 22:01.153
What kind of backpack he carries.
What kind of camera he puts in it.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.990
We know the shape and location
of his very distinctive birthmark...

22:05.365 --> 22:07.576
what brand of fucking sneaker he wears.

22:07.659 --> 22:08.702
And guess what?

22:09.161 --> 22:11.163
It's all a pile of worthless bullshit

22:11.246 --> 22:14.791
because we are no closer to finding him
than we were when we started.

22:15.625 --> 22:16.625
Am I wrong?

22:18.962 --> 22:20.505
Please, someone, tell me I'm wrong.

22:25.802 --> 22:28.972
Just because we can't see the path
doesn't mean it's not there.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.977
Are you seriously whipping out
your Jesus shit right now?

22:34.603 --> 22:37.731
As far as I can tell,
Jesus has a piss-poor sense of direction

22:37.814 --> 22:41.318
because we are about as far as we can be
from any kind of fuckin' path.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.236
This guy is out there,

22:43.653 --> 22:46.698
driving around, preying on the most
vulnerable women he can find,

22:46.782 --> 22:48.992
and we have no idea who or where he is.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.703
Your Lord has not given us
one goddamn break,

22:51.787 --> 22:53.987
so as far as I'm concerned,
he can just go fuck himself.

23:04.174 --> 23:05.374
Okay.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.470
Unless anyone has anything else,
we're done.

23:11.139 --> 23:14.226
- Actually, I don't know if...
- Actually, what?

23:15.435 --> 23:18.605
Uh... Well, I'm...
I'm not a 100 percent sure about it.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.368
It might be something,
but it might not be.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.560
Why don't you tell me and I'll decide.
How about that?

23:22.901 --> 23:25.862
Okay. So, I've been using mapping software

23:25.946 --> 23:29.116
to chart reports of suspicious vehicles
around each of the four crime scenes.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.952
There's this...
this drive-time polygon tool...

23:32.035 --> 23:33.203
Elias, just...

23:34.079 --> 23:35.205
Right, okay.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.375
So, I found this hit early this morning.

23:38.792 --> 23:42.754
Three weeks before the Lakewood attack,
a half block to the east,

23:43.380 --> 23:45.757
a neighbor reported an unfamiliar truck

23:45.841 --> 23:47.426
idling outside her home.

23:47.843 --> 23:48.844
A white Mazda.

23:50.470 --> 23:53.265
Yeah, that, uh... that's something.

23:53.348 --> 23:55.350
- You got a license plate?
- Uh, yeah.

23:55.725 --> 23:56.725
It's, uh...

23:57.310 --> 23:59.604
Uh, just, uh...

24:02.232 --> 24:04.568
- It was right here.
- For fuck's sake, Elias.

24:04.651 --> 24:05.902
Oh, I... I got it.

24:06.528 --> 24:10.532
66GFT1.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.427
Find out who that vehicle
was registered to.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.535
Somebody?

24:13.618 --> 24:16.329
There was a Mazda on the security tapes
in the Golden case,

24:16.413 --> 24:18.808
driving around for hours,
but we couldn't make a plate on it.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.560
- I'm in the DMV database.
- Excuse me, um...

24:20.584 --> 24:22.270
- Get me on the goddamn search page.
- Okay.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.045
Well, I... I... well, I wasn't done.

24:26.715 --> 24:29.968
I have the registration
and the owner's name...

24:31.094 --> 24:32.387
and his driver's license.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.436
Christopher McCarthy.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.899
We need two unmarked cars at the location,
71 Harcourt Street.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.662
Put Leonard in one and Nunez in the other.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.170
- Roger that.
- Somebody call the DOD.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.046
- Find out if this guy's a veteran.
- I'll do it.

24:49.070 --> 24:52.532
No car details released, okay?
Not the model, not the color, nothing.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.577
Oh. No, sorry, scratch that.
We can totally go wide on this

24:55.660 --> 24:58.121
and alert our suspect that we're onto him.
Up to you.

24:58.205 --> 25:01.500
Okay, pull up the LPR database
and see if we get any hits on the Mazda.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.251
LPR?

25:03.335 --> 25:04.503
License Plate Reader.

25:04.586 --> 25:08.298
It's a small high-speed camera attached
to the front of some of our patrol cars.

25:08.381 --> 25:11.009
They take a picture
of every license plate they pass.

25:11.092 --> 25:14.596
Eighteen hundred pictures a minute,
downloaded into a central database.

25:14.971 --> 25:18.391
Bless your heart, State Senator Bianchi,
'cause they ain't cheap.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.727
The second you get an LPR hit
on the truck, the guy,

25:20.810 --> 25:23.647
and the broken mirror, let me know
and I will call it in to the DA.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.440
Intern, good work.

25:47.504 --> 25:48.504
Marie.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.591
It's 2:00 a.m.

25:51.925 --> 25:54.177
Well, it's technically 1:53,
but I hear ya...

25:54.261 --> 25:55.554
Your curfew's at 9:00.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.265
You're right, this will not happen again.

25:59.015 --> 26:00.015
And you're high.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.103
I am?

26:09.276 --> 26:11.236
You're right. I kind of am.

26:11.611 --> 26:12.904
- Marie...
- Sorry.

26:14.489 --> 26:16.575
I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty buzzed.

26:18.368 --> 26:19.953
When you joined Rise Up,

26:20.537 --> 26:21.788
you signed a contract.

26:30.630 --> 26:31.630
I'm sorry.

26:32.382 --> 26:34.259
I'm... I'm really sorry.

26:35.635 --> 26:36.635
Me too.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.374
It won't be for long, I promise.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.500
It's fine.

27:08.585 --> 27:11.379
Ricardo doesn't mind having Nadia
in his room.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.131
He gets scared at night.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.223
- Can I help you with that?
- I'm fine.

27:23.266 --> 27:26.186
I have an interview
with OfficeMax next week.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.980
Did you ever hear back from Chipotle?

27:30.148 --> 27:32.525
No, I have to follow up with them
again today.

27:36.196 --> 27:39.866
This is why we don't quit a job
before we have a new job in place.

27:44.412 --> 27:47.415
Wh... what do you mean it doesn't rise
to the level of probable cause?

27:47.499 --> 27:49.659
I can sign off on a warrant,
but you'd have a hard time

27:49.709 --> 27:51.878
gettin' a judge to sign it.
Bring me something else.

27:52.337 --> 27:55.215
We have victim's descriptions
that match pictures of McCarthy.

27:55.298 --> 27:57.759
We found a picture on an LPR of McCarthy

27:57.842 --> 28:01.012
with the same Mazda that's on
the surveillance tapes in Golden.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.139
We have a shoe print and a glove print
at Lakewood

28:03.223 --> 28:05.225
that match prints
at two of the other scenes.

28:05.308 --> 28:07.453
<i>Yeah, I'm telling you, that's
not gonna be enough for the judge.</i>

28:07.477 --> 28:08.603
<i>We need something better.</i>

28:08.687 --> 28:11.606
DNA from the car door handles,
soda can in the trash, something.

28:11.690 --> 28:15.235
- You don't get two shots at this.
- Fine, just, keep your phone on.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.097
Hey, what'd you find?

28:53.773 --> 28:58.820
And you already saw that one,
BigTeenTitties.com, right?

29:00.780 --> 29:02.574
Let me call you back.

29:02.657 --> 29:06.911
Max. He's helping us search for porn sites
registered to McCarthy's name.

29:06.995 --> 29:07.829
And?

29:07.912 --> 29:11.708
One so far: SuperKinkySluts.com.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.252
Though none of the pictures
were of our victims.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.212
Someone else's, though.

29:16.296 --> 29:17.296
Yeah.

29:18.631 --> 29:19.758
Any movement here?

29:20.383 --> 29:21.968
Nothing. Quiet all night.

29:23.678 --> 29:24.721
Hey, uh...

29:25.597 --> 29:27.724
I wanted to say sorry for the whole...

29:28.850 --> 29:30.143
"fuck the Lord" thing.

29:30.226 --> 29:32.937
I mean, it was not my finest moment.

29:34.397 --> 29:37.025
That's nothing I haven't thought
100 times myself.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.821
I just have the good sense
to keep it to myself.

29:44.407 --> 29:48.119
In truth, I kinda envy
all you God-believers.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.747
I'd love to have that kind of faith.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.623
Yeah.

29:54.083 --> 29:56.044
I don't know, the stuff we see...

29:57.420 --> 30:00.048
It's hard enough with God,
I... I don't know...

30:01.132 --> 30:02.801
how anyone does it without.

30:02.967 --> 30:06.262
Uh, alcohol...

30:08.515 --> 30:09.724
and my dogs.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.937
But mainly... yeah, alcohol.

30:14.437 --> 30:15.437
Steve.

30:16.564 --> 30:19.442
Him too, but you know,
when things get hairy at work,

30:19.526 --> 30:21.194
you always go off the rails a little.

30:21.277 --> 30:23.321
Yeah, they don't advertise

30:23.404 --> 30:25.865
that part of the job at the Academy,
do they?

30:26.157 --> 30:28.868
Hmm. Wouldn't make for much
of a recruitment poster.

30:29.202 --> 30:33.414
"To Serve, Protect and Emotionally
Withhold From Your Partner."

30:35.708 --> 30:38.253
- Mm.
- The thing is, you can't let up.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.424
I was a runner in high school...

30:44.175 --> 30:45.175
a sprinter.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.095
And it was the same thing.

30:47.178 --> 30:50.557
You drop your concentration in the 100
even for just half a second,

30:50.640 --> 30:55.478
even just like, hey, there's my mom
in the stands, you are done.

30:56.062 --> 30:58.314
And a guy like that, a planner...

30:59.816 --> 31:02.902
he's thinking about this 24-hours a day.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.529
And any second I'm not...

31:05.780 --> 31:07.115
he is pullin' ahead.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.993
Max the Knife seems like he'd, uh,

31:10.076 --> 31:11.995
he'd appreciate that kind of drive.

31:12.078 --> 31:13.788
You know, not be threatened by it.

31:15.623 --> 31:18.960
So, where does that stupid name come from?
'Cause he won't tell me.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.462
Then I'm not gonna.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.715
- Oh, come on.
- No way.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.642
It's something dorky, isn't it?

31:35.101 --> 31:37.020
It's pretty fucking dorky, yeah.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.066
Anyway, he gets it.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.570
The girls, not so much.

31:46.863 --> 31:47.863
They will.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.827
My, uh, my mom was an ER nurse.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.704
She worked a lot.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.291
I didn't love it,
but it made me self-sufficient, so...

31:58.875 --> 31:59.875
Yeah.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.253
- You want that for them.
- Oh, I... I know.

32:09.093 --> 32:11.220
I mean, what do you think
he's doing in there?

32:13.056 --> 32:14.891
Probably something really boring.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.937
That's the thing I was most struck by
when I worked undercover...

32:19.145 --> 32:22.148
how fuckin' boring these guys are.
When they're not out dealing drugs

32:22.231 --> 32:24.984
and assaulting people, they're just
sitting around and doin' nothing.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.281
You know, we met then.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.408
- Who? You and me?
- Yeah.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.702
Or, I mean, kind of.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.371
I was a rookie.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.000
I was called to a scene,

32:41.709 --> 32:46.089
a big drug bust at a burger joint,
I guess.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.342
You were undercover with these guys
for, like, a year.

32:49.425 --> 32:52.428
- Sure, yeah. God, you were there?
- Yeah.

32:53.554 --> 32:56.224
Ah, no kidding. That was a great day.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.142
I was the shit that day.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.144
You were.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.439
And I was a total fangirl.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.943
- Really?
- Yeah, I had just started at Golden.

33:07.860 --> 33:11.072
And I'm not from a cop family,
so this was all new to me.

33:11.155 --> 33:15.576
I'm, like, figuring out how to dress
and how to act, and...

33:16.119 --> 33:17.996
do I defer, do I speak up?

33:18.788 --> 33:22.208
And we pull up to this scene

33:22.542 --> 33:26.462
and there you are in your whole...

33:27.630 --> 33:29.590
undercover, dope queen outfit.

33:29.674 --> 33:33.219
Oh, God, that was an excellent outfit.

33:33.594 --> 33:34.679
Ah.

33:34.929 --> 33:38.224
And the looks on those guys' faces,
like, "Her?"

33:38.307 --> 33:41.144
Yeah, like, "What? She's a fuckin' cop?"

33:41.644 --> 33:42.645
Ha!

33:43.312 --> 33:48.276
And I just thought, "Okay,
I don't have to defer or second-guess.

33:48.901 --> 33:51.904
I can just show up and get the job done."

33:53.573 --> 33:54.574
That's right.

33:59.078 --> 34:00.121
So, thanks.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.498
A decade later.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.335
I feel a little less shitty

34:06.419 --> 34:08.212
about cursing out
your Lord and Savior now.

34:08.295 --> 34:09.338
Mm-hmm.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.514
I still dream about my first rape case...

34:18.931 --> 34:21.434
maybe 15 years ago.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.643
Me too.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.106
Deena Jones.

34:28.107 --> 34:29.859
Night before her 16th birthday.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.277
Mary-Pat Owens.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.364
Thirty-two year old mother of three.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.789
Hey, you should get some sleep.
Nunez has this, okay?

34:42.871 --> 34:45.875
Yeah. No. I'm, uh, about to...

34:47.918 --> 34:49.212
about to head home.

34:53.882 --> 34:56.052
Before I ask you
to enter your plea,

34:56.135 --> 34:57.804
do you have any questions for me?

34:58.304 --> 34:59.304
No.

34:59.555 --> 35:01.915
Do you wish to talk further
with your lawyer?

35:02.308 --> 35:03.308
No.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.896
Are you pleading guilty
because you are guilty?

35:10.024 --> 35:11.024
Yes.

35:11.234 --> 35:14.445
Is that because
on the 11th of August 2008,

35:14.529 --> 35:17.615
you falsely reported to Officers Parker
and Pruitt

35:17.698 --> 35:19.534
of the Lynnwood Police Department

35:19.617 --> 35:23.121
that you had been raped in your apartment
at the Oakdale Apartments?

35:24.413 --> 35:25.413
Yes.

35:25.832 --> 35:29.085
And you falsely reported
that same allegation again,

35:29.168 --> 35:32.505
two days later,
on the 13th of August 2008.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.635
I'm pretty positive that it happened.

35:38.010 --> 35:41.097
Pretty positive or positive?

35:42.557 --> 35:43.391
Yes.

35:43.474 --> 35:49.021
And in doing so,
you were in violation of RCW9A.84.040

35:49.105 --> 35:50.982
of the Washington State penal code.

35:51.357 --> 35:54.235
There is a rapist... there isn't.

35:56.487 --> 35:57.487
Yes.

35:57.822 --> 36:00.491
Do you understand
that by entering a plea of guilty,

36:00.575 --> 36:02.493
if that plea of guilty is accepted
by the court,

36:02.577 --> 36:04.787
you will have waived your right
to a trial?

36:08.124 --> 36:09.124
Yes.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.396
It is the finding
of the court in the case

36:12.420 --> 36:14.297
of Washington State versus Marie Adler

36:14.380 --> 36:16.799
that the defendant is fully competent

36:16.883 --> 36:19.343
and capable of entering an informed plea.

36:28.978 --> 36:30.897
Hey, hon.

36:32.773 --> 36:34.453
I thought we were putting
the second camera

36:34.525 --> 36:36.235
on top of the cable box at 88.

36:36.444 --> 36:39.324
Yeah, these guys think
they'll get too much interference there.

36:40.656 --> 36:43.034
Before the field trip,
or they won't let her go.

36:44.243 --> 36:45.243
Okay.

36:47.413 --> 36:48.413
Sorry.

36:49.457 --> 36:52.335
Oh, Selig, never apologize
for taking care of your family.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.977
- Yeah.
<i>- What the fuck?</i>

36:58.382 --> 37:00.092
I know. What is he doing in there?

37:00.843 --> 37:03.596
Looks like he's gettin' ready
for a busy day of raping.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.223
Okay.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.684
- What? Too far?
- Uh, yeah.

37:08.976 --> 37:11.979
With our luck, this guy's probably
got the flu. He'll be in there for days.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.397
Well, I'm okay with that

37:13.481 --> 37:16.734
as long as it allows for the possibility
of him choking on his own vomit.

37:16.817 --> 37:19.403
Karen Duvall,
that's not very Christian of you.

37:19.487 --> 37:22.156
Read your <i> Old Testament, </i> woman,
we're big into vengeance.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.180
<i>Okay, we have eyes on the suspect.</i>

37:28.204 --> 37:30.373
<i>He's leaving the house
with a Caucasian woman,</i>

37:30.456 --> 37:32.166
<i>five-two, maybe five-three.</i>

37:32.416 --> 37:35.795
Suspect is getting into
a gray Toyota Corolla.

37:38.130 --> 37:43.511
<i>Suspect is in
the passenger seat. License plate 62DRR2.</i>

37:45.221 --> 37:46.806
Fucking come on.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.675
<i>The suspect
is turning on to Sheridan.</i>

38:11.414 --> 38:13.708
Suspect is moving south
on Sheridan Boulevard,

38:13.791 --> 38:15.209
moving towards West Fourth.

38:15.710 --> 38:16.710
Okay.

38:17.670 --> 38:21.716
Would it be too much for me to hope
that he is going to workout?

38:23.050 --> 38:26.012
Put on some gym shorts,
let me get a look at that nasty leg.

38:28.055 --> 38:29.055
What?

38:34.186 --> 38:36.647
Suspect is now moving northbound
on Sheridan Boulevard.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.566
What? Wait, he's coming back?

38:39.483 --> 38:41.603
<i>No, suspect is turning off.</i>

38:48.951 --> 38:52.246
Vehicle's entered the diner
at the corner of Marcy and Sheridan.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.136
Suspect is entering the diner.

39:07.970 --> 39:09.930
You ready to go get us some DNA?

39:14.727 --> 39:17.521
You should at least
move it around the plate.

39:24.278 --> 39:25.946
Okay, let's do this.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.916
Once we know the house is empty,
your guys can set up the cameras.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.046
Look at him.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.425
He looks like any other guy.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.138
You know, you got a clear shot.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.015
Yeah, well...

39:54.392 --> 39:58.062
was kinda hopin' I'd stick around
and... raise my kids.

40:17.873 --> 40:19.208
Wonder if she knows.

40:19.875 --> 40:21.675
She could be in on it
for all we know.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.421
People are weird.

40:26.298 --> 40:27.633
Leave the mug.

40:27.883 --> 40:29.427
Leave the mug.

40:32.555 --> 40:33.639
Thank you.

40:38.185 --> 40:39.185
Okay.

40:55.995 --> 40:58.497
All right, no one's home.
Let's give them the go.

41:00.249 --> 41:01.249
Hello.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.967
I'm Detective Rasmussen.
This is Agent Taggart.

41:10.050 --> 41:13.429
We, uh, we are investigating
a string of burglaries in the area.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.766
You seen anyone around
who looks like this?

41:21.687 --> 41:22.813
No.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.066
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop. Police!

41:26.150 --> 41:27.630
- Police.
- It's okay.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.236
Don't touch that mug.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.030
I need that mug.

41:32.531 --> 41:33.971
You mind if I get your name?

41:38.329 --> 41:41.707
Christopher McCarthy,
thank you for your DNA.

41:44.543 --> 41:47.004
Chris McCarthy.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.885
Anyone else live here with you?

41:52.968 --> 41:54.011
Just my brother.

41:55.513 --> 41:58.224
All right. Well, why don't we leave
one of these with you

41:58.307 --> 42:00.518
in case either of you
come across this guy...

42:00.976 --> 42:02.019
give us a shout.

42:02.811 --> 42:03.854
Will do.

42:13.739 --> 42:15.074
Holy fuck.
