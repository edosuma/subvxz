WEBVTT

00:05.911 --> 00:07.682
So last night
I'm at Burgerama

00:07.683 --> 00:09.198
and the new guy is sitting
a few tables over.

00:09.199 --> 00:09.810
You mean, the
guy with the...?

00:09.811 --> 00:11.242
No. Oh, the guy with...?

00:11.243 --> 00:12.469
Yes!
Love him.

00:12.470 --> 00:13.341
I know.

00:13.890 --> 00:15.054
Hi.

00:15.055 --> 00:16.506
He's so cute.
Oh, bye.

00:16.507 --> 00:17.789
So, anyway...

00:18.142 --> 00:20.003
I looked at him,
and then he looked away

00:20.004 --> 00:22.567
and then he looked at me,
and then I looked away

00:22.568 --> 00:24.787
and then...
we totally ignored each other.

00:26.679 --> 00:28.269
I mean, we really connected.

00:28.270 --> 00:29.486
Can you believe it,
girl?!

00:29.487 --> 00:30.930
I got a boyfriend.

00:36.782 --> 00:38.516
I can't wait to meet him, Rae.

00:38.517 --> 00:40.556
Yeah, me, too.

00:40.557 --> 00:41.228
What?

00:41.229 --> 00:42.560
Oh, oh,
there he is.

00:42.561 --> 00:43.856
Oh, snap, there he is!

00:45.240 --> 00:46.231
Him!

00:52.446 --> 00:54.756
Don't we look fabulous together?

00:54.757 --> 00:56.786
Except for that shirt,
that's got to go.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.154
Okay, I think
this really needs to be said--

01:00.155 --> 01:01.672
you don't know him!

01:02.275 --> 01:03.150
I'm telling you...

01:03.151 --> 01:04.745
Hey, guys.
What's up, Amber?

01:04.745 --> 01:05.914
Hey, don't
forget about

01:05.915 --> 01:06.874
my party this weekend.

01:06.875 --> 01:09.025
I'll be there
with my boyfriend, of course

01:09.026 --> 01:11.876
and Ryan's taking Lisa,
and Ellie's going with Carter.

01:11.877 --> 01:12.979
And you two can
go with...

01:14.057 --> 01:15.022
each other.

01:17.522 --> 01:19.602
But you know what?
That's okay.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.686
Excuse me, Little Miss Missy,
all right?

01:22.687 --> 01:24.216
But I have a boyfriend.

01:24.217 --> 01:25.401
Oh, perfect.

01:26.829 --> 01:29.394
And now
for a reality update

01:29.395 --> 01:30.821
that guy's
not your boyfriend.

01:31.483 --> 01:33.021
And that's okay.

01:34.307 --> 01:36.014
You know what? He is.

01:36.015 --> 01:37.886
He's just in denial, okay?

01:37.887 --> 01:39.097
Don't worry
about it.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.137
We are going to get
you a boyfriend

01:40.138 --> 01:41.654
because we are not
going to that party

01:41.655 --> 01:43.423
without one,
all right?

01:51.093 --> 01:52.802
Rae, what'd you see?

01:52.803 --> 01:54.372
I saw Lawler's class

01:54.373 --> 01:57.230
and one of us
is getting The Seat.

02:00.807 --> 02:02.187
Yeah, I know

02:02.188 --> 02:04.203
but I don't know which one
of us it was. Wait a minute.

02:04.204 --> 02:05.608
We don't even have
Lawler's class.

02:05.609 --> 02:06.451
Yeah.

02:06.452 --> 02:07.881
Lawler's taking over
first period

02:07.882 --> 02:09.797
and he's starting a whole new
seating chart-- come on!

02:09.798 --> 02:11.448
I cannot get The Seat,
no way!

02:11.449 --> 02:13.681
Wait, let's just calm down,
take a breath

02:13.682 --> 02:16.317
and approach this
rationally, hmm?

02:16.318 --> 02:18.458
Is it me?
Think, woman, think!

02:21.787 --> 02:23.682
It's first come, first served!

02:24.137 --> 02:25.528
Raven, run!

02:25.529 --> 02:27.611
Girl, in these shoes,
this is running!

02:27.612 --> 02:28.792
Come on, now!

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.422 --> 02:52.056
Reservations for Raven?

02:52.057 --> 02:53.141
Thank you.

02:53.142 --> 02:55.902
You really need to get
a cell phone, all right?

02:55.903 --> 02:57.067
Thank you.

02:59.273 --> 03:00.724
Mr. Thomas...

03:01.485 --> 03:02.572
have a seat.

03:04.582 --> 03:06.717
People, people, please?

03:07.287 --> 03:08.522
Settle, please?

03:09.187 --> 03:10.381
Tyrell...

03:10.382 --> 03:12.513
Patty, please?

03:13.970 --> 03:15.290
Pay attention, people.

04:06.994 --> 04:08.253
Yep, that's me.

04:15.582 --> 04:17.386
That is why punctuality

04:17.387 --> 04:19.374
is a pet peeve of mine.

04:19.375 --> 04:20.721
I cannot say it enough.

04:20.723 --> 04:23.611
Punctuality, punctuality,
punctuality.

04:29.188 --> 04:30.188
Hi.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.667
Raven Baxter?

04:34.668 --> 04:36.241
Miss Baxter?

04:36.813 --> 04:38.707
Miss Baxter?

04:38.708 --> 04:40.107
Answer him!

04:42.152 --> 04:44.661
Please don't make him
say your name again.

04:45.579 --> 04:46.881
I'm so sorry.

04:46.882 --> 04:48.374
That was so rude, Mr. Lawler.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.200
And may I say

04:49.201 --> 04:51.821
that science would have to be
my favorite subject.

04:51.822 --> 04:52.752
Excellent.

04:53.506 --> 04:54.663
Too bad this is English.

04:55.434 --> 04:56.281
Which is why

04:56.282 --> 04:58.742
you'll each be getting
a copy of Oliver Twist

04:58.743 --> 05:01.538
the tragic tale
of a tortured youth.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.337
I can relate.

05:08.264 --> 05:09.317
Miss Baxter

05:09.318 --> 05:11.132
please pass out
the reading lists.

05:11.974 --> 05:14.005
Girl, you are not going
to believe this.

05:14.006 --> 05:15.108
I just saw you with a...

05:15.109 --> 05:16.703
guy!

05:17.622 --> 05:18.492
...so cool

05:18.493 --> 05:20.138
I found my boyfriend
at Burgerama

05:20.139 --> 05:21.924
and you are going
to find yours

05:22.357 --> 05:23.648
somewhere in all this.

05:23.649 --> 05:24.614
Raven, once again

05:24.615 --> 05:26.568
you are making way
too big a deal out of this.

05:26.569 --> 05:27.470
All you saw
in your vision

05:27.471 --> 05:28.450
was me talking
to some guy.

05:28.451 --> 05:29.564
A really cute guy.

05:29.565 --> 05:31.087
But you only saw
the back of his head.

05:31.088 --> 05:32.479
A really cute
back of his head.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.653
How do you know
I even liked him?

05:33.654 --> 05:34.660
Because you did your...

05:36.708 --> 05:37.971
I snorted?

05:37.972 --> 05:39.016
Big time.

05:39.322 --> 05:41.137
We've got to find this guy.

05:42.601 --> 05:43.830
Rae, this is crazy.

05:43.831 --> 05:45.481
What do I care
about bringing a guy

05:45.482 --> 05:46.728
to Amber's stupid party?

05:46.729 --> 05:49.883
Um, Chelse, this is bigger
than the party, all right?

05:49.884 --> 05:52.213
This is the year we're going
to have boyfriends together.

05:52.214 --> 05:54.749
I found mine, and now
you're going to find yours.

05:55.157 --> 05:56.517
Okay, what are
you writing?

05:57.128 --> 05:59.720
You don't have
a boyfriend, okay?

06:01.377 --> 06:05.234
Read it, memorize it,
eat it.

06:09.382 --> 06:11.212
But, but,
you're missing the point.

06:11.213 --> 06:12.236
We could double-date.

06:12.237 --> 06:14.486
I am talking...
parties together

06:14.487 --> 06:16.081
movies, dancing...

06:16.082 --> 06:17.464
Do you mind if I
eat while you nag?

06:19.115 --> 06:20.528
Fine, but don't blame me

06:20.529 --> 06:22.054
when you're all alone
at Amber's party

06:22.055 --> 06:23.495
stuffing your face
full of chips

06:23.496 --> 06:24.632
while I'm
with my boyfriend

06:24.633 --> 06:25.676
and all you
can say is...

06:26.679 --> 06:28.355
"I wish I listened
to Raven."

06:29.627 --> 06:31.635
Look, Rae, I know
you mean well

06:31.636 --> 06:33.725
but I'll meet him
when I meet him, okay?

06:37.054 --> 06:38.438
I'm so sorry.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.439
Oh, it's, it's okay.

06:46.582 --> 06:47.532
Hi.

06:48.078 --> 06:49.192
Hi.

06:55.622 --> 06:57.167
That's him!

06:57.168 --> 06:58.369
That's the guy,
the guy!

06:58.370 --> 06:59.282
That's the guy,
the guy!

06:59.283 --> 07:00.252
You even did the laugh.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.003
Did I snort?

07:01.004 --> 07:02.230
Like a pig!

07:04.594 --> 07:05.411
Okay, okay,
calm, calm.

07:05.750 --> 07:06.881
What's his name?

07:06.882 --> 07:09.056
Well, you pulled me away
before I could ask.

07:09.057 --> 07:10.435
No, Chelse, I
pulled you away

07:10.436 --> 07:11.569
before you looked like...

07:12.113 --> 07:13.679
Oh, shut up! I am not.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.739
What's up,
"Splash Mountain"?

07:18.655 --> 07:20.783
You know what's worse
than warm spit?

07:21.382 --> 07:23.092
Cold spit.

07:24.982 --> 07:26.281
Hey, Eddie, you
know those shirts

07:26.282 --> 07:27.186
in the lost and found

07:27.187 --> 07:28.758
that are, like,
better off lost?

07:28.759 --> 07:29.986
Go find one.

07:33.722 --> 07:34.748
Rae, he's
coming over.

07:34.749 --> 07:35.755
Rae, what do I do?

07:35.756 --> 07:37.497
Just be yourself,
play hard to get

07:37.498 --> 07:39.014
and don't be
all clingy.

07:39.015 --> 07:40.827
I am not clingy.

07:40.828 --> 07:41.657
Okay, then.

07:41.658 --> 07:42.791
Wait, don't leave me!

07:43.337 --> 07:44.569
Girl, please.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.216
Um, I grabbed your
history book by mistake.

07:50.217 --> 07:51.547
Oh, thanks.

07:52.248 --> 07:54.996
Uh, look, I have
History next, too.

07:54.997 --> 07:56.186
You walking over?

07:56.187 --> 07:57.082
Um...

07:58.082 --> 07:59.551
Not... not right away.

07:59.552 --> 08:01.716
Well, maybe I'll see you
at lunch.

08:01.717 --> 08:03.543
Yeah, that'd be great.

08:07.197 --> 08:09.174
Heard it all, love that you
didn't go with him.

08:09.175 --> 08:11.175
Yeah, I just let him
walk right on by

08:11.176 --> 08:12.473
didn't even
budge an inch.

08:12.474 --> 08:14.144
And totally not clingy.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.229
That's right.

08:19.357 --> 08:20.637
Please!

08:35.249 --> 08:36.299
See?

08:36.299 --> 08:38.123
Totally not clingy.

08:46.523 --> 08:48.067
Pepperoni pizza.

08:50.651 --> 08:52.955
Pipe down, Paul,
and eat your pudding.

09:00.990 --> 09:02.262
I like that.

09:03.137 --> 09:04.405
I have that.

09:06.761 --> 09:08.868
It was either this
or a tube top.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.865
Well, I sort
of like history.

09:13.866 --> 09:15.626
I like it, too.

09:15.627 --> 09:17.852
I mean, I guess it's 'cause
I'm really good at dates.

09:18.752 --> 09:19.887
In-in history.

09:20.621 --> 09:21.991
Dates in history.

09:22.757 --> 09:24.050
So, uh

09:24.051 --> 09:25.209
what are you doing after school?

09:25.210 --> 09:27.342
Um, nothing...

09:30.883 --> 09:33.699
...that I could just
possibly get out of.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.533
Busy, busy, busy me.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.265
How about tomorrow after school?

09:38.149 --> 09:39.752
Yeah, sure.

09:43.755 --> 09:45.056
I can't rid of Sam.

09:45.057 --> 09:46.433
No way.

09:46.434 --> 09:48.055
Because he's my Sammy.

09:48.056 --> 09:49.317
Yes, you are!

09:49.318 --> 09:52.447
Yes, you are my little
Sammy-Whammy boy! Aw!

09:56.892 --> 09:58.660
Chelsea...

10:01.832 --> 10:03.193
Chelsea!

10:11.422 --> 10:13.264
Raven wants you.

10:14.175 --> 10:16.416
This will just
take a second.

10:16.417 --> 10:19.813
I'm sorry, just wait one minute,
sorry.

10:20.257 --> 10:21.251
What?

10:21.252 --> 10:22.027
I just had a vision

10:22.028 --> 10:24.293
that someone wants you
to get rid of your dog.

10:24.294 --> 10:25.785
No way.

10:25.786 --> 10:27.646
Like I'd ever give up
my little Sam.

10:27.647 --> 10:28.812
Yeah?

10:30.452 --> 10:31.547
Excuse me?

10:32.253 --> 10:34.020
Well, you said
my name-- Sam.

10:41.630 --> 10:42.748
Your name's Sam?

10:43.973 --> 10:46.732
Raven, he's another little
Sammy-Whammy boy.

10:47.422 --> 10:48.794
I'm a what?

10:48.795 --> 10:51.704
Sam, she calls
all her guys that.

10:51.705 --> 10:54.998
That's her little
Eddie-Weddie boy.

10:54.999 --> 10:56.617
Uh, uh, okay, you call me that?

10:56.618 --> 10:57.724
Th-That's gotta stop.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.297
That's gotta stop, yeah.

11:00.553 --> 11:02.581
And, and we
gotta go.

11:02.582 --> 11:04.089
Oh, uh, I'll
walk you out.

11:04.090 --> 11:06.081
No, no, Sam, stay.

11:08.843 --> 11:10.608
Sam... sit.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.170
Good boy!

11:14.837 --> 11:16.107
You guys, I'm supposed
to meet him

11:16.108 --> 11:17.597
after school tomorrow--
what am I going to do?

11:17.598 --> 11:20.058
Every time I say his name now,
I'm going to think of my dog.

11:20.059 --> 11:22.696
Who cares if he has
the same name as your dog?

11:22.697 --> 11:24.242
You know, he is so fine.

11:24.243 --> 11:26.256
Yeah, he is cute, isn't he?

11:26.257 --> 11:27.482
This is so silly.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.082
Hey, Sam?

11:38.566 --> 11:42.135
Don't worry, she likes you,
you lucky dog.

11:49.922 --> 11:52.352
I still can't believe
I met a guy named Sam.

11:54.852 --> 11:55.463
You know what?

11:55.464 --> 11:56.625
The party is this Saturday.

11:56.626 --> 11:59.108
Just get over it
and-and ask him to go.

11:59.109 --> 12:01.412
Sure. As soon
as you ask your boyfriend.

12:01.413 --> 12:03.262
You know, you'd say,
"Hey, you want to go

12:03.263 --> 12:04.119
to the party
Saturday night?"

12:04.120 --> 12:06.100
And then he'd say,
"And you are...?"

12:06.101 --> 12:08.849
Okay, listen, little
Miss Missy, all right.

12:08.850 --> 12:10.336
I spoke to
my boyfriend.

12:10.337 --> 12:11.866
We had a little
conversation.

12:11.867 --> 12:13.616
Get out. You did?
What'd he say?

12:13.617 --> 12:14.759
Let me tell you.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.346
Okay, I called him, right, and I said...

12:16.347 --> 12:18.186
He said, "Hello,"
and then I said...

12:18.187 --> 12:19.967
"Is this
Ernie's Pizza?"

12:19.968 --> 12:21.059
And then in
the cutest way

12:21.060 --> 12:22.683
he said, "No."

12:26.824 --> 12:28.152
And then he hung up.

12:28.937 --> 12:30.528
Girl, it was magical.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.486
And then her father said,
in the cutest way

12:35.487 --> 12:36.686
"Get off the phone."

12:36.687 --> 12:37.821
And she did.

12:37.822 --> 12:39.927
And it was so magical.

12:41.838 --> 12:43.972
Dad, this is serious, all right?

12:44.414 --> 12:46.821
This is about Amber's party.

12:46.822 --> 12:49.116
Amber's having a party,
and she didn't invite me?

12:49.117 --> 12:51.022
That is so like her.

12:53.422 --> 12:55.003
Chelsea, look,
why don't you just

12:55.004 --> 12:56.418
change your dog's name?

12:56.419 --> 12:58.063
But that's his name.

12:58.064 --> 12:59.216
I- I can't get rid of Sam.

12:59.217 --> 13:00.550
No way.

13:00.850 --> 13:02.656
Because he's
my Sammy.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.684
Yes, you are!

13:03.685 --> 13:06.456
Yes, you are my little
Sammy Whammy boy!

13:06.457 --> 13:07.231
Homework.

13:07.232 --> 13:08.298
I need the computer.

13:08.299 --> 13:09.213
Get away, maggot.

13:09.214 --> 13:10.629
Okay, fine.

13:10.630 --> 13:12.521
Undermine my education.

13:12.522 --> 13:15.329
Step on the hopes and dreams
our father has for his children.

13:17.222 --> 13:19.211
Boy, I'd be happy
if you just flushed.

13:21.131 --> 13:23.065
Rae, it's not
that I don't want a boyfriend.

13:23.066 --> 13:24.656
It's just maybe this guy
is not the one.

13:24.657 --> 13:25.923
And I agree.

13:25.924 --> 13:27.172
Chelsea...

13:27.173 --> 13:28.351
Corey here.

13:28.352 --> 13:30.397
Listen, I heard
about your problem

13:30.398 --> 13:32.293
and if you need someone
to talk to

13:32.294 --> 13:35.524
or watch you exercise,
I'm here for you, baby.

13:38.967 --> 13:40.696
You still wear those pajamas?

13:40.697 --> 13:42.686
You know, the ones
with the bunny feet...

13:42.687 --> 13:43.865
baby?

13:47.052 --> 13:49.252
Well, baby,
if that's what turns you on.

13:53.652 --> 13:55.222
Hand over the phone, worm.

14:00.013 --> 14:00.851
Don't look at me.

14:00.852 --> 14:02.132
The boy is good.

14:02.722 --> 14:05.132
And my nickname
isn't worm or maggot.

14:05.133 --> 14:07.517
It's... Dr. Love.

14:08.961 --> 14:10.227
Nickname.

14:10.228 --> 14:12.156
Girl, nickname--
that's what we can do.

14:12.157 --> 14:13.381
We can give him a nickname.

14:13.382 --> 14:15.211
Then you can call him anything
you want.

14:15.212 --> 14:18.278
And for your FYI,
I have Corey's spit in my ear.

14:18.279 --> 14:19.317
Ew!

14:20.922 --> 14:22.121
Call you later.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.516
It's not going to work, honey.

14:23.517 --> 14:24.854
There's only one place

14:24.855 --> 14:26.134
where guys can get
a good nickname.

14:26.135 --> 14:28.756
Unfortunately,
girls aren't allowed.

14:28.757 --> 14:29.769
Where?

14:31.144 --> 14:32.303
Tell her, son.

14:33.281 --> 14:34.822
The gym!

14:38.517 --> 14:40.447
Ooh, nice shot.

14:48.582 --> 14:50.222
Get out here!

14:57.182 --> 14:58.212
Yeah.

14:59.347 --> 15:01.022
Chelsea,
get out here.

15:04.119 --> 15:05.205
Yeah, yeah.

15:05.206 --> 15:06.851
You know.

15:06.852 --> 15:08.988
Are your draws riding up
or something?

15:08.989 --> 15:10.628
No. All right?

15:11.299 --> 15:12.787
Like this. Come on.

15:13.087 --> 15:14.581
Yeah. That's it.

15:14.582 --> 15:16.069
It's all about the shoulders.

15:16.070 --> 15:17.786
It's all about
the shoulders.

15:17.787 --> 15:20.165
Yeah. Yeah,
you got it.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.302
All right.
That's my boyfriend.

15:21.303 --> 15:22.616
No, no.
Raven, no.

15:22.617 --> 15:23.921
No. No.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.833
We are going to be such
a cute couple

15:25.834 --> 15:26.937
once I'm a girl again.

15:26.938 --> 15:29.076
Let's just get
in the game.

15:34.337 --> 15:35.597
Moving pick.

15:35.598 --> 15:37.136
No moving your feet
when you block.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.186
You know that, Sam.
All right.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.418
Okay, pick.
Nose picker.

15:39.419 --> 15:40.786
Booger, booger, booger.

15:40.787 --> 15:41.903
Way to go, Booger!

15:41.904 --> 15:43.122
All right, Booger.

15:45.347 --> 15:47.181
Chelsea and Booger?

15:47.182 --> 15:49.444
Oh, sure, if you
say it like that.

15:53.352 --> 15:54.886
Okay, that's what I want to see.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.368
Nice dunk, Sam.
Nice dunk.

15:56.369 --> 15:57.816
Dunk, dunk, dunker, dunkey.

15:57.817 --> 15:58.952
Way to go, dunkey!

16:01.663 --> 16:02.894
All right.

16:02.895 --> 16:06.261
Great. So I've gone
from a dog to a donkey.

16:06.262 --> 16:07.813
But that sounds stupid.

16:07.814 --> 16:08.979
No, but if you say Dunk...

16:08.980 --> 16:10.037
Let's have a
cooler name.

16:10.038 --> 16:11.533
No, but I'm trying
to tell you.

16:12.782 --> 16:14.082
I don't know
you, do I?

16:14.646 --> 16:15.077
But, uh

16:15.078 --> 16:17.937
I do know that those sunglasses
are against the rules.

16:17.938 --> 16:19.221
It's a silly rule, but, uh

16:19.222 --> 16:20.952
do you know who made it up?

16:20.953 --> 16:22.409
No.
Me!

16:23.579 --> 16:25.116
Now, names?

16:25.117 --> 16:26.481
Uh, I'm Bill.

16:26.482 --> 16:28.356
And, uh, I'm-I'm Bob.

16:28.357 --> 16:29.264
Last names.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.043
Uh, Bob?

16:32.107 --> 16:33.555
Bob Bob?

16:33.556 --> 16:35.251
Yeah, Coach,
and I'm Bill Bob.

16:35.252 --> 16:37.205
Uh, yeah, we're-we're cousins,
right, Bob?

16:37.206 --> 16:37.789
Bill.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.782
Uh, see, even we get confused.

16:41.175 --> 16:43.510
Well, let me see
if I can unconfuse you.

16:43.511 --> 16:45.414
You're Shirts.
You're Skins.

16:45.415 --> 16:47.526
Shirts over there,
Skins over there.

16:47.527 --> 16:48.317
Move.

16:48.318 --> 16:49.464
All right.
All right.

16:49.465 --> 16:51.755
Shirts, yeah, yeah. Yeah,
I'm a Skin, I'm a Skin.

16:51.756 --> 16:53.344
All right, yeah,
I'm a Skin.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.339
I'm a Skin, yo.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.534
I'm a Skin.

16:55.535 --> 16:56.953
Yo, dawg, what's Skins?

17:00.622 --> 17:01.654
Oh, snap.

17:01.655 --> 17:03.089
I'm a Shirt.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.075
Yeah, I'm a Shirt.

17:04.076 --> 17:05.951
I'm a Shirt, Shirt,
Shirt, Shirt.

17:05.952 --> 17:08.013
We Shirts, girl. We
got to get out of here.

17:08.015 --> 17:09.806
But-but they-they were
going to let me play guard.

17:10.686 --> 17:12.817
How's the seat,
D.J. Dribble?

17:12.818 --> 17:14.006
Yeah.

17:14.007 --> 17:15.693
Spit for brains.

17:16.482 --> 17:18.981
# Sitting in a seat,
soaked to his feet #

17:18.982 --> 17:21.579
# Everybody knows
that the fool is dead meat #

17:21.579 --> 17:22.836
# We ain't joking #

17:22.837 --> 17:24.260
# This kid is soaking wet #

17:24.261 --> 17:25.357
# We ain't joking #

17:25.358 --> 17:26.821
# This kid is soaking! #

17:27.661 --> 17:28.966
Soaking.
Whoo!

17:29.739 --> 17:31.619
Let me break it down for y'all.

17:31.620 --> 17:32.681
All right, uh...

17:32.682 --> 17:34.516
# I may be sitting
in the seat #

17:34.517 --> 17:35.487
# Soaked to my feet #

17:35.488 --> 17:36.892
# But this homeboy's
got you beat #

17:36.893 --> 17:38.443
# And you can call me names #

17:38.444 --> 17:39.686
# Make funny faces
by the dozens #

17:39.687 --> 17:41.662
# 'Cause you're nothing but
a bunch a sad rapping cousins #

17:41.663 --> 17:42.764
# You think you're so smart #

17:42.765 --> 17:43.941
# You get Fs and Ds #

17:43.942 --> 17:46.178
# And your grades so low, man,
you get straight Zs #

17:46.179 --> 17:48.416
# I may be stuck sitting
through spit and spray #

17:48.417 --> 17:49.589
# But it don't really matter #

17:49.590 --> 17:51.304
# 'Cause I'm gonna get an "A"! #

17:53.032 --> 17:54.717
That was all, yeah, yeah.

17:54.718 --> 17:56.123
Yeah.

17:56.124 --> 17:57.551
Yeah, okay.

17:57.552 --> 17:58.628
Yo, way to go, Eddie.

17:58.629 --> 18:00.606
Man, you get an "A"
in Lawler's class?

18:00.607 --> 18:03.190
I don't know, but it rhymed,
and you know?

18:03.942 --> 18:04.919
Hey, where are you going?

18:04.920 --> 18:06.064
I got a boyfriend to meet.

18:06.065 --> 18:07.862
If Eddie can get over
being stuck with a seat

18:07.863 --> 18:09.416
I can get over a stupid name.

18:09.417 --> 18:10.539
That's my girl.

18:10.540 --> 18:12.413
We are so double-dating
this weekend! Oh!

18:17.279 --> 18:18.256
You guys want to
shoot some hoops

18:18.257 --> 18:19.516
after school today?

18:19.517 --> 18:21.856
I thought you were going
to meet that girl after school.

18:21.857 --> 18:23.223
Chelsea?

18:23.224 --> 18:24.521
Nah. It's...

18:24.522 --> 18:26.202
just not there for me.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.806
Rae, I don't
like that face.

18:32.060 --> 18:33.547
Yeah, well...

18:33.548 --> 18:35.239
I didn't like my vision.

18:40.694 --> 18:41.829
Oh, good you're here.

18:41.830 --> 18:42.812
Okay, I'm meeting Sam.

18:43.093 --> 18:44.268
What do you think?

18:45.322 --> 18:46.230
you look good.

18:46.232 --> 18:48.067
You look really good.

18:49.092 --> 18:50.723
But you know,
I was thinking

18:50.724 --> 18:52.385
um, that dating a guy

18:52.387 --> 18:53.930
with the same
name as your dog

18:53.933 --> 18:57.032
you know, is really
kind of bizarre.

18:57.252 --> 19:00.070
And dating a guy
you don't really know is kind of

19:00.072 --> 19:02.166
you know, bizarre... er.

19:03.434 --> 19:04.622
I was just thinking.

19:04.624 --> 19:05.777
He is not your type.

19:05.779 --> 19:07.847
You mean, tall
and really cute?

19:07.849 --> 19:09.706
Yes, girl.
That is so last year.

19:09.708 --> 19:10.968
Do you know
what is in right now?

19:10.970 --> 19:12.695
Those little cute,
short dumpy guys.

19:12.697 --> 19:14.187
They are so cute!

19:14.189 --> 19:17.472
Your participation
has positively improved

19:17.474 --> 19:18.547
Mr. Thomas.

19:18.582 --> 19:20.914
Thanks to my
new seating plan.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.082
Thanks, Mr. Lawler, but, uh...

19:24.847 --> 19:26.066
nature calls.

19:30.522 --> 19:32.839
What are you two doing
in the boy's bathroom?

19:35.552 --> 19:37.945
Uh, okay, uh, this is bad.

19:37.947 --> 19:38.883
I'm out of here.

19:38.917 --> 19:40.047
Me, too.

19:40.082 --> 19:41.822
I don't want to be
late meeting Sam.

19:41.857 --> 19:43.556
He's not going to be there.

19:44.709 --> 19:45.795
What?

19:47.313 --> 19:49.125
She saw it in a vision.

19:51.756 --> 19:53.018
Well...

19:53.052 --> 19:55.858
he said it
just wasn't there for him.

19:57.868 --> 19:59.507
But, like,
what does he know, girl?

19:59.509 --> 20:01.418
He is crazy,
'cause you got it.

20:01.420 --> 20:03.914
You got it all over you.
All over.

20:03.917 --> 20:05.285
All up in there.
You got it.

20:05.286 --> 20:07.335
Yeah. I mean, you absolutely have it.

20:07.337 --> 20:08.400
I...

20:08.402 --> 20:11.653
Uh... maybe not my it,
you know, 'cause we friends

20:11.655 --> 20:13.752
and friends don't look
at friends' its.

20:14.723 --> 20:16.539
But, uh, for lots of other guys

20:16.541 --> 20:19.398
you-you definitely have it
going on.

20:20.112 --> 20:21.224
Nice try.

20:22.513 --> 20:23.456
Bottom line is

20:23.458 --> 20:24.715
I still don't have a boyfriend.

20:26.682 --> 20:29.252
Chelsea, did we have
a good year last year?

20:29.287 --> 20:30.587
Yeah.

20:30.622 --> 20:31.917
And did we have
boyfriends?

20:31.952 --> 20:33.822
No, but what about
all that stuff you said

20:33.824 --> 20:35.533
about boyfriends
and double-dating?

20:35.535 --> 20:36.697
I said a lot of stuff.

20:36.699 --> 20:38.453
I was wrong, all right?

20:38.455 --> 20:40.419
Sure, it would be
fun to date someone

20:40.421 --> 20:42.121
but we don't have
to date someone

20:42.123 --> 20:43.438
to have fun.

20:43.439 --> 20:46.033
We are going to Amber's party together.

20:46.035 --> 20:47.431
And if we find
boyfriends

20:47.433 --> 20:49.552
it'll be because they're
nice sweet guys...

20:49.587 --> 20:51.219
who have cars.

20:51.912 --> 20:52.817
Man...

20:52.852 --> 20:54.754
this Cheryl is bad!

20:55.947 --> 20:57.563
Is this her current number?

21:26.952 --> 21:28.282
What up, dawg?

21:29.744 --> 21:33.014
I, uh, kind of like that girl
you blew off.

21:33.057 --> 21:34.187
Hope it's cool.

21:34.977 --> 21:37.033
Uh, yeah, no problem.

21:37.035 --> 21:37.610
Go for it.

21:37.612 --> 21:38.712
Good.

21:38.714 --> 21:39.728
'Cause she invited me

21:39.730 --> 21:43.242
to a Warriors/Laker game
tonight, floor seats.

21:44.715 --> 21:46.322
Her dad's tight with Kobe.

21:47.211 --> 21:49.210
Oh, man!

21:50.680 --> 21:51.811
Oh, yeah.

21:51.813 --> 21:54.122
Well, uh, peace out.

21:57.382 --> 21:59.187
Rae, you were brilliant.

21:59.222 --> 22:01.934
Yeah, well, uh, no one
messes with my girl.

22:04.665 --> 22:06.353
You doing a
great job.

22:06.387 --> 22:07.625
