00:37.417 --> 00:38.748
Hey, Alan?

00:40.420 --> 00:42.081
Okay, I'm ready.

00:42.889 --> 00:46.825
Needles, condoms, blankets,
take more than you need.

00:47.260 --> 00:49.694
Someday you'll change your mind
about living down here in the tunnel,

00:49.763 --> 00:51.890
but until then I
want you to stay alive.

00:52.566 --> 00:56.024
Take extra for Alan. He
missed the last two meetings.

00:56.103 --> 00:58.071
I ain't seen him.
No one's seen him.

01:01.842 --> 01:04.572
He hasn't been out here
at all the last month.

01:04.644 --> 01:07.204
He got too close to
Donald, is what happened.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.748
Donald's like a vortex.
He just sucks you in.

01:10.817 --> 01:13.183
Rose, would you ask around, let
people know I'm looking for Alan?

01:13.253 --> 01:14.345
Okay.

01:15.522 --> 01:18.980
I don't care what anybody told
you, Vicki, Alan didn't bring it in.

01:19.059 --> 01:21.459
He made his living
off this stuff.

01:21.528 --> 01:23.894
It's even stripped and rolled
up the way Alan does it.

01:23.964 --> 01:25.795
It didn't
come from him!

01:25.866 --> 01:28.391
Somebody took it from him?
Was it Donald?

01:28.468 --> 01:30.163
Did he send it up?

01:30.971 --> 01:33.531
Charlie, take me
down to Donald.

01:33.607 --> 01:35.234
I want to ask him
what happened.

01:35.308 --> 01:37.105
Woman, you're nuts.

01:37.177 --> 01:39.338
I don't go
down there. Ever.

01:51.458 --> 01:53.551
It's all there. $120.

01:54.928 --> 01:57.453
Ten more if you
help me load it in.

02:05.439 --> 02:07.236
It came in
yesterday.

02:10.310 --> 02:13.370
Let's try to get 20
slides done by lunchtime.

02:15.182 --> 02:17.912
Dr. May, what do
you make of this?

02:17.984 --> 02:20.350
Right above this tattoo,
is that something?

02:23.557 --> 02:26.583
Yes, it's something.
It's a bullet wound.

03:16.510 --> 03:19.411
Before we harvest the
brain, we shave the skull.

03:19.479 --> 03:20.946
That's when we
discovered the wound.

03:21.014 --> 03:23.847
Do you have a name for
this... Male or female?

03:23.917 --> 03:26.886
Female. And, no, we don't know her name.

03:27.420 --> 03:29.718
All the human tissue
in our research

03:29.789 --> 03:32.815
is acquired through our
Procurement Department.

03:32.893 --> 03:35.259
I've never seen a bullet
wound up close before.

03:35.328 --> 03:36.352
It's an unusual one.

03:36.429 --> 03:41.423
The powder burns and the stippling is
usually distributed over the surface.

03:42.002 --> 03:45.028
But instead, it's concentrated
around the entry wound.

03:45.105 --> 03:47.665
What are those green
shards around the entry?

03:49.342 --> 03:50.639
It's plastic.

03:53.079 --> 03:54.910
It's a bottle silencer.

03:55.982 --> 03:58.644
Well, the shooter stuck his weapon
into the mouth of a soda bottle,

03:58.718 --> 04:01.346
pressed it against
her head and fired.

04:02.122 --> 04:03.111
Oh, this is
Dr. Whitburn,

04:03.189 --> 04:05.987
he's the assistant director
of Human Tissue Procurement.

04:06.059 --> 04:08.357
Doctor, we need to know
where this specimen came from.

04:08.428 --> 04:11.625
Metcalfe University, from
their Willed Body Program.

04:11.698 --> 04:14.030
Did they give you any
paperwork or identification?

04:14.100 --> 04:15.658
No, that's not
their protocol.

04:15.735 --> 04:17.464
What is
their protocol?

04:17.536 --> 04:21.337
Well, I just show up at their facility
with a cashier's check and a saw.

04:24.578 --> 04:26.512
<i>That check's
just a processing fee.</i>

04:26.580 --> 04:28.445
$15,000
processing fee?

04:28.515 --> 04:30.642
And you still can't find
the paperwork on that head?

04:30.717 --> 04:32.480
Give me till the end of next week.

04:33.253 --> 04:35.312
The rest of her
in one of these?

04:36.590 --> 04:40.082
Look at that. It's a
heart from a Mr. Haas.

04:40.860 --> 04:42.589
It hardly looks used.

04:42.662 --> 04:43.856
What do these
usually go for?

04:43.930 --> 04:45.864
We heard $10,000.

04:47.534 --> 04:50.230
Knee tendons, these are
usually a thousand a pop, right?

04:50.303 --> 04:52.294
I should talk
to an attorney.

04:52.372 --> 04:55.000
Better make it a good one,
with experience in murder cases.

04:55.075 --> 04:57.168
That lady's head
had a bullet in it.

04:57.243 --> 04:59.541
Who donated it?
Sammy the Bull?

05:00.647 --> 05:04.276
Cat got your tongue? Because
there's an extra one in here.

05:07.420 --> 05:08.751
I ain't stealing.

05:09.522 --> 05:11.547
He don't belong
to nobody.

05:12.192 --> 05:13.523
They're just there
for the picking,

05:13.593 --> 05:15.254
serving no good purpose.

05:15.328 --> 05:17.023
Where do you find
these bodies?

05:17.097 --> 05:18.223
Under the city.

05:18.298 --> 05:22.462
People die down there same as
up here from maladies, poisons...

05:22.535 --> 05:23.900
Murder.

05:23.970 --> 05:25.369
I take them
like I find them.

05:27.507 --> 05:30.101
You're just a stage in
the natural process, huh?

05:30.176 --> 05:31.200
That's right.

05:31.277 --> 05:34.212
But maybe for 120 bucks,
you help nature along.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.770
A bullet did this.

05:35.849 --> 05:40.582
Clear the wax out of your
ears. I told you I don't...

05:49.262 --> 05:50.490
What is it, Bo?

05:50.563 --> 05:53.623
This one got by me. I
should've taken a better look.

05:55.168 --> 05:57.966
You had other bodies
with this kind of wound?

05:58.038 --> 06:01.371
I dug one up last month. He had
a hole just like this in his head.

06:01.441 --> 06:05.138
Your friend at the university didn't
report any other bodies with a gunshot.

06:05.211 --> 06:08.180
He wouldn't have bought it if
he'd seen a hole like that in him.

06:08.281 --> 06:12.183
So I smashed
the head up a bit

06:13.319 --> 06:16.220
to hide the hole before
bringing it to him.

06:16.956 --> 06:20.187
Better I take them than
leaving them for Donald.

06:20.260 --> 06:21.659
Who's Donald?

06:22.195 --> 06:23.958
A demon, of course.

06:27.701 --> 06:31.034
So now a second gunshot victim's
gone through the Metcalfe meat market.

06:31.104 --> 06:32.799
What do you make
of this mutt?

06:32.872 --> 06:34.703
What you see
is what you get.

06:35.442 --> 06:37.171
Straightforward,
cooperative...

06:37.243 --> 06:38.733
Not to mention
unarmed.

06:39.412 --> 06:41.004
Let's hold on to him.

06:41.081 --> 06:42.514
Hang a public health
charge on him

06:42.582 --> 06:45.574
and get the ME to track
down the other victim.

06:47.153 --> 06:50.054
Metcalfe still
had his hands and feet.

06:50.523 --> 06:52.923
His head was up
in San Francisco.

06:53.660 --> 06:59.257
The rest of him is at
a research lab in Maui.

06:59.933 --> 07:01.332
Some people have
all the luck.

07:01.401 --> 07:03.198
The bullet wound match
the Jane Doe's?

07:03.269 --> 07:05.362
Right down to
the plastic fragments.

07:05.438 --> 07:07.429
Latent didn't score
with the fingerprints.

07:07.507 --> 07:09.737
That green stain
on his left hand...

07:10.777 --> 07:12.472
See? Between the thumb
and the forefinger?

07:12.545 --> 07:13.842
Do you have any idea
what that is?

07:13.913 --> 07:16.848
No. It's worn into the
skin and callused over.

07:18.485 --> 07:22.649
Looks like he might have pulled
something across his hand.

07:24.357 --> 07:25.551
It's metallic.

07:28.294 --> 07:29.625
Copper turns green.

07:29.696 --> 07:31.857
He might have been
pulling copper wire.

07:31.931 --> 07:33.592
If you
don't mind.

07:37.036 --> 07:39.402
Bo said that he found him in
a tunnel under Penn Station.

07:39.472 --> 07:41.940
There're a lot of recycling
centers around there.

07:42.976 --> 07:45.410
More than a couple of
guys bring in copper wire.

07:45.478 --> 07:47.776
Any of them gone
missing lately?

07:47.847 --> 07:50.475
Hard to say. They don't keep a schedule.

07:50.550 --> 07:54.577
How about a woman with a
pink braid, you know her?

07:57.490 --> 07:58.855
It's Vicki.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.855
She came here last week
looking for this guy Alan.

08:01.928 --> 08:04.897
Alan being one of the guys
who brings you copper wire?

08:04.964 --> 08:07.228
Any reason she thought
you'd seen him recently?

08:07.767 --> 08:09.496
Well, no.

08:09.702 --> 08:11.033
You sure?

08:13.206 --> 08:16.972
Because whoever did that sure has
a unique way of rolling their wire.

08:17.043 --> 08:18.510
Alan do that?

08:18.578 --> 08:21.513
He might've done it,
but Donald sent it up.

08:22.015 --> 08:23.414
What do you mean,
"sent it up"?

08:23.483 --> 08:25.110
Donald never
comes up himself.

08:25.185 --> 08:28.416
He needs something done out here,
he'll find somebody to do it for him.

08:28.488 --> 08:29.955
You told Vicki this came from Donald?

08:30.023 --> 08:31.149
Yeah.

08:31.558 --> 08:33.549
She wanted me to take
her down to see him.

08:33.626 --> 08:36.958
But that man radiates
so much evil,

08:37.030 --> 08:38.587
even police radios
don't work.

08:42.402 --> 08:43.835
I lost the signal.

08:53.146 --> 08:54.773
That's
close enough!

08:55.915 --> 08:57.712
Now, you turn around.

08:57.884 --> 09:01.115
You still have time to get out of here.

09:01.187 --> 09:03.121
Hey, Donald.

09:03.189 --> 09:04.656
Right, I'm Donald.

09:05.225 --> 09:07.921
You got your
Donald up there,

09:07.994 --> 09:10.622
but I'm the Donald
down here, you see?

09:10.897 --> 09:13.229
I own this real estate.

09:13.299 --> 09:14.630
We're not here
to dispute that.

09:14.701 --> 09:15.861
We just need to
talk to you.

09:15.935 --> 09:18.028
Yeah? I don't need
to talk to you.

09:18.738 --> 09:20.729
You sons of bitches
come any closer,

09:22.442 --> 09:23.841
I'll make your
heads blow up!

09:24.344 --> 09:25.606
Listen to your radios!

09:25.678 --> 09:27.669
About those
radio signals, Donald.

09:28.181 --> 09:33.983
Now, right up here is where
three power lines intersect,

09:34.053 --> 09:37.716
and, well, that's what's
interfering with the radio signals.

09:39.559 --> 09:42.460
See, you're no demon,
you're just a smart guy.

09:43.529 --> 09:45.053
I just want to be
left alone.

09:45.131 --> 09:49.227
We understand that, but we
have to ask you about Alan.

09:51.137 --> 09:52.195
Now,

09:54.374 --> 09:58.606
you sold a spool of copper
wire that belonged to him.

09:58.678 --> 10:00.441
He gave up his
rights to it, okay?

10:00.513 --> 10:05.143
He quit his nest. I waited
four weeks. Rules are rules.

10:05.218 --> 10:08.619
Somebody shot him and left
his body under the A line.

10:10.223 --> 10:12.623
Well, I don't know
anything about that.

10:14.661 --> 10:16.288
We're gonna
need to see it.

10:18.731 --> 10:21.222
Empty. But it looks brand-new.

10:21.601 --> 10:23.296
So does
this umbrella.

10:23.770 --> 10:25.567
We've got blood
spatter here.

10:25.638 --> 10:27.071
Cherry blossoms here.

10:28.875 --> 10:32.743
These went into bloom
about four weeks ago.

10:34.547 --> 10:37.812
He must've taken a walk
in the park on a rainy day.

10:38.284 --> 10:40.252
New wallet,
new umbrella,

10:40.520 --> 10:42.988
maybe he had a whole
other life aboveground.

10:43.056 --> 10:45.547
Yeah, maybe a life that killed him.

10:49.395 --> 10:51.158
We got the name
from Social Services.

10:51.230 --> 10:54.688
Vicki Hale, she was a volunteer
with the Health Department.

10:54.767 --> 10:56.667
And Alan Richardson,

10:56.736 --> 10:59.569
he was an electrician before he
started living in the tunnels.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.105
Beaming signals to
the mother ship?

11:04.210 --> 11:07.304
There's an impression on
the leather of Alan's wallet.

11:09.282 --> 11:12.080
The Chief of D's concerned
some nut's hunting tunnel rats.

11:12.151 --> 11:13.641
We don't think
it's random.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.051
Alan might have gotten
a straight job.

11:15.121 --> 11:17.851
It could have something to
do with why he was killed.

11:17.924 --> 11:19.323
Let me know.

11:22.729 --> 11:24.253
What'd you get?

11:30.236 --> 11:34.070
Alan must have used his wallet
as a writing surface, you know?

11:36.709 --> 11:39.837
Looks like it's been
traced over and over,

11:39.912 --> 11:41.743
in an effort to
remember it.

11:42.181 --> 11:46.311
Looks like an "A" with
a "P" and a "U" inside.

11:46.386 --> 11:47.853
Maybe a logo.

11:53.159 --> 11:55.150
No, this guy's
never worked for me.

11:56.963 --> 12:00.160
You do sell used auto parts, don't you?

12:00.400 --> 12:01.890
Right, over the Web.

12:02.535 --> 12:04.935
So maybe Alan sold you some old parts,

12:05.004 --> 12:06.733
you know, starter motors, solenoids...

12:06.806 --> 12:09.707
No, I don't buy
parts from bums.

12:09.776 --> 12:12.040
All my suppliers
are aboveboard.

12:12.111 --> 12:14.636
You must be partial to
the Crown Victoria.

12:14.714 --> 12:17.046
He has lots of parts
for it, especially doors.

12:17.817 --> 12:20.650
But you seem to be out
of driver's side doors.

12:21.387 --> 12:23.014
Those sell out
real fast.

12:23.256 --> 12:25.053
That's funny, you don't seem to stock

12:25.124 --> 12:27.957
bell housings or dashboards
for the Crown Vic, either.

12:28.027 --> 12:30.621
Those sell out real
fast too, right, Kenny?

12:30.696 --> 12:32.288
They just
fly right out the door.

12:32.365 --> 12:34.629
No, see, Kenny,
dashboards,

12:34.700 --> 12:36.930
bell housings and
driver's side doors

12:37.036 --> 12:39.231
are three places where the
VIN numbers are stamped.

12:39.305 --> 12:43.469
You don't stock those because
you're selling parts off hot cars.

12:43.810 --> 12:45.334
That's not true.

12:45.978 --> 12:47.240
And now you're
gonna have to leave.

12:47.313 --> 12:51.215
We're happy to oblige. But we'll
be seeing you again real soon.

12:54.554 --> 12:57.045
If I was looking to
steal used Crown Vics,

12:57.123 --> 12:58.522
I know exactly
where I'd look.

13:02.528 --> 13:04.723
<i>We haven't had any Crown
Vics stolen off the lot.</i>

13:04.797 --> 13:07.197
But at last month's auction, some
guy stiffed us on three of them.

13:07.266 --> 13:08.995
How did he do that?

13:09.335 --> 13:11.462
He put a winning
bid on the cars,

13:11.537 --> 13:13.300
total a little
under 15 grand.

13:13.906 --> 13:16.966
He put down 20%% cash and spread
the rest over three credit cards.

13:17.043 --> 13:18.738
He didn't pay
his credit cards.

13:18.811 --> 13:22.474
They can't find the guy.
Address was a mailbox.

13:24.684 --> 13:27.380
I have a copy of his
driver's license, if you like.

13:27.453 --> 13:29.683
His name was
Alan Richardson?

13:29.755 --> 13:31.416
Yeah, that's him.

13:32.391 --> 13:35.383
This scam, has anyone
ever tried it before?

13:37.063 --> 13:40.464
A year ago. Two cars,
different guy, same M.O.

13:41.467 --> 13:43.901
Well, we'll need the
paperwork on that one, too.

13:45.171 --> 13:46.729
One week Alan's
living in the tunnels,

13:46.806 --> 13:49.366
the next he's got three credit
cards and a bank account.

13:49.442 --> 13:51.535
He must have been
pinching himself.

13:52.578 --> 13:55.069
There's no record Alan
ever worked for Kenny Miles.

13:55.148 --> 13:57.776
And the other employees don't
remember seeing him there.

13:57.850 --> 14:00.011
He still could've been there with
somebody else, delivering parts,

14:00.086 --> 14:01.553
when he copied
those symbols.

14:03.055 --> 14:05.387
So this is it.
The rest of the iceberg.

14:05.958 --> 14:09.519
<i>Seven car auctions in the
Tri-State over the last 14 months,</i>

14:09.595 --> 14:13.895
each with the same M.O., always
sedans, Crown Vics, Impalas.

14:13.966 --> 14:16.400
The total take's
just over $120,000.

14:16.469 --> 14:18.027
None of these guys
have records?

14:18.104 --> 14:21.301
Well, a record would make it
hard for them to get good credit.

14:21.874 --> 14:25.037
Whoever orchestrated this
scheme is very careful.

14:26.445 --> 14:29.073
Now, these are
all homeless men,

14:29.916 --> 14:33.579
but within two months, they each
had over $20,000 worth of credit.

14:34.253 --> 14:35.914
He first got them
a bank account,

14:35.988 --> 14:37.888
then a department
store credit card

14:37.957 --> 14:40.357
and that leveraged
a real credit card,

14:40.426 --> 14:42.189
and then another
and another.

14:42.828 --> 14:46.229
Once they got the cars, they probably
ended up the same way Alan did.

14:46.299 --> 14:47.789
Kenny Miles has been buying
hot parts from them.

14:47.867 --> 14:48.993
He's gotta know
who's behind it.

14:49.068 --> 14:50.126
Maybe not.

14:50.203 --> 14:52.398
His employees say he's
got dozens of suppliers.

14:52.471 --> 14:55.133
They change every month.
It's an all-cash business.

14:55.208 --> 14:57.267
And, of course,
he doesn't keep records.

14:58.377 --> 15:01.778
Poor bastards probably thought
their ship finally came in.

15:01.847 --> 15:04.611
Instead, it landed
on top of them.

15:06.485 --> 15:11.115
I think all it's gonna need is to
tighten that fan belt up a smidge.

15:12.124 --> 15:14.558
All right, sweetheart.
I just wanted to check in.

15:14.627 --> 15:15.787
All done.

15:16.329 --> 15:18.490
The labors of love
are never done.

15:19.565 --> 15:21.362
All right, you ready? Hmm.

15:22.168 --> 15:24.796
On two. One, two.

15:27.273 --> 15:30.333
You know, Gil, a man
spends his whole life

15:30.409 --> 15:32.206
looking for a place
to fit in.

15:32.712 --> 15:35.613
If he's lucky enough
to find it,

15:35.681 --> 15:37.706
he should never
let it go.

15:38.217 --> 15:41.414
Good job. You're gonna
fit in here just fine, Gil.

15:42.054 --> 15:44.682
No more living in the tunnels for you.

15:49.228 --> 15:51.492
Sorry, sweetie,
I don't know them.

15:51.564 --> 15:54.089
But if they lived in these tunnels,
this is where they'd come out, right?

15:54.166 --> 15:55.224
Yeah.

15:55.301 --> 15:58.395
Have you seen anybody around here
recruiting men to work with cars?

15:58.471 --> 15:59.529
No.

16:01.073 --> 16:03.906
Oh, look, someone wants
to refinance my home.

16:04.710 --> 16:07.042
Nope. Nope.
Thanks, Lucia.

16:08.281 --> 16:09.714
Oh, him we know.
It's Tony.

16:09.782 --> 16:11.477
Haven't seen him
in what?

16:11.550 --> 16:12.881
Since Veteran's Day.

16:12.952 --> 16:15.785
Now, did he mention getting
a job on the outside?

16:15.855 --> 16:18.323
He said he got a job
working with a mechanic,

16:18.391 --> 16:20.325
but he didn't want
anyone horning in on it.

16:20.393 --> 16:22.554
We don't know these
other fellows.

16:22.628 --> 16:25.825
We gotta get back under now. It's
getting too damn bright out here.

16:27.099 --> 16:28.589
Just one more thing.

16:29.602 --> 16:33.197
There's all these sandwich
wrappers around here.

16:33.272 --> 16:34.534
Have people been handing out food?

16:34.607 --> 16:37.235
There's an old gal, comes
with tuna fish and lemonade.

16:37.310 --> 16:38.743
You know where
we can find her?

16:38.811 --> 16:40.301
Don't know where she comes from,

16:40.379 --> 16:42.438
but her sandwiches
aren't half bad.

16:43.349 --> 16:45.078
They got sweet
pickles in them.

16:45.985 --> 16:47.350
All right, thanks.

16:48.354 --> 16:50.788
You guys take care
of yourselves!

16:55.661 --> 16:57.788
There's some kind of
fortune in here.

17:00.333 --> 17:05.099
"Absolute perfection belongs not to
man nor to angels, but to God alone. "

17:05.971 --> 17:09.304
That's John Wesley, founder
of the Methodist Church.

17:12.511 --> 17:13.978
<i>I've never seen him.</i>

17:14.046 --> 17:15.741
He's an
auto parts dealer.

17:15.815 --> 17:18.477
You ever hear the men talk about
getting a job working with cars

17:18.550 --> 17:19.643
or a mechanic?

17:20.219 --> 17:24.019
No, but they don't appreciate
nosy people, so I turn my ears off.

17:24.089 --> 17:26.251
You'd think they'd
trust you by now.

17:26.325 --> 17:28.384
The minister said you've
been going to the train cut

17:28.461 --> 17:30.088
for nearly
eight years.

17:30.162 --> 17:31.993
I try not to
get familiar.

17:33.199 --> 17:36.498
If you give them a chance, those
people will break your heart.

17:37.837 --> 17:41.398
Ms. Cahill, we'd like to show you
some photos, see which ones you know.

17:43.309 --> 17:45.243
I think his
name's Alan.

17:45.311 --> 17:48.439
There was somebody else
looking for him, a young woman.

17:51.884 --> 17:53.875
Oh, that's her. Vicki.

17:57.490 --> 17:59.355
The two of them were
murdered in the tunnels.

17:59.425 --> 18:01.325
Fudge. I can't
get this open.

18:04.330 --> 18:05.388
Let me help you.

18:05.464 --> 18:07.864
Thank you.
My hands are slippery.

18:11.036 --> 18:13.129
What about
these other men?

18:24.817 --> 18:27.081
I don't recognize
any of them.

18:27.853 --> 18:30.413
So many people come
for the sandwiches.

18:31.123 --> 18:32.988
And the sweet pickles.

18:34.160 --> 18:37.323
I have to drive this over
to our women's shelter.

18:38.898 --> 18:42.834
Is that you? A '66 Ford
Country Squire station wagon.

18:42.902 --> 18:44.062
It's in great shape.

18:44.136 --> 18:46.570
It was my father's.
He took good care of it.

18:46.639 --> 18:48.072
Who takes care
of it now?

18:48.140 --> 18:51.200
Oh, whoever's at the
filling station when I go in.

18:51.577 --> 18:52.703
Oh, thank you.

18:52.778 --> 18:53.870
Sure.

18:55.347 --> 18:56.905
Bye-bye.
Bye.

19:03.589 --> 19:05.557
There was no squeal when
that engine started up.

19:05.624 --> 19:09.060
Somebody rubbed a bar of soap
on the back of that fan belt.

19:09.128 --> 19:11.358
Well, you don't get that kind
of service at a gas station.

19:11.430 --> 19:13.523
Someone's
babying that car.

19:13.866 --> 19:14.992
Rose
isn't married.

19:15.067 --> 19:18.161
She's widowed or divorced,
I'm not really sure.

19:18.671 --> 19:20.901
But she has
a daughter. Jenny.

19:21.006 --> 19:23.270
Does Jenny have a
boyfriend who's a mechanic?

19:23.342 --> 19:24.809
I couldn't tell you.

19:24.877 --> 19:27.744
Rose has been coming to
our church for 10 years,

19:27.813 --> 19:29.838
and it's only in the
last year and a half

19:29.915 --> 19:32.247
that I've heard her
even mention Jenny.

19:32.318 --> 19:34.343
Does she live
with Ms. Cahill?

19:34.420 --> 19:38.220
Rose lives alone.
I think Jenny's upstate.

19:38.557 --> 19:40.957
She might even have
a medical situation.

19:41.026 --> 19:43.494
I can't get the
straight story from Rose.

19:43.562 --> 19:45.553
Well, she's pretty
straightforward about her feelings

19:45.631 --> 19:47.098
towards the homeless.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.828
When we told her some of her
homeless had been murdered,

19:49.902 --> 19:52.302
it didn't get much
of a reaction.

19:53.472 --> 19:55.565
She once told me
a remarkable thing.

19:55.641 --> 19:58.701
She said sometimes she finds
it hard to look at the homeless

19:58.777 --> 19:59.937
while she's
handing out food.

20:00.012 --> 20:02.947
She can't stop herself thinking
about how terrible their life is.

20:03.015 --> 20:07.418
So she closes her eyes and
imagines she's feeding kittens.

20:13.158 --> 20:17.254
In the winter, when she parks
that big boat of hers out there,

20:17.329 --> 20:19.126
she ever have trouble
starting it up?

20:19.198 --> 20:22.565
Sure. Last January I saw her
out there with the hood up.

20:22.635 --> 20:24.296
Who does she call,
the Auto Club?

20:25.504 --> 20:26.994
A local mechanic,
I think.

20:27.072 --> 20:29.302
I was about to go help
her when he drove up.

20:29.375 --> 20:30.865
Any markings
on the truck?

20:30.943 --> 20:34.845
No. Just a plain
green pickup.

20:35.481 --> 20:37.972
Pickup truck,
not a tow truck?

20:38.050 --> 20:39.608
Right.

20:40.185 --> 20:43.712
Green, the old
City Park vehicles.

20:44.123 --> 20:48.025
Could be another blue-plate
special from a city car auction.

20:49.828 --> 20:52.160
Oh, I don't think
it means anything.

20:53.999 --> 20:55.023
Jeez.

20:55.100 --> 20:59.002
Please, don't cry. I'll be
back real soon. Don't worry.

20:59.672 --> 21:02.607
I'm not gonna let
anything happen, I promise.

21:03.943 --> 21:07.640
I got the pink slip. I told
them to start loading the cars.

21:09.114 --> 21:11.048
So we gonna get
something to eat?

21:12.084 --> 21:13.073
No.

21:14.153 --> 21:15.848
We have a change of plan.

21:22.928 --> 21:25.658
All right, the city sold five
salt-spreaders in the last four years.

21:25.731 --> 21:27.631
One went to
the city of Goshen,

21:27.700 --> 21:30.635
three went out of state
and one went to Brooklyn.

21:32.304 --> 21:33.601
Perkins Automotive.

21:33.672 --> 21:36.573
Butch Perkins, sole
proprietor. Let's look him up.

21:40.579 --> 21:43.548
Well, well. He went to prison
when that Danish was still fresh.

21:43.616 --> 21:47.211
<i>Two-year stint for fraud
in 1984. Nothing since.</i>

21:48.487 --> 21:51.012
He has a bunch of
bankruptcy filings.

21:51.223 --> 21:54.124
Something tells me
it's time for a tune-up.

21:57.029 --> 22:00.055
Hi. You got a minute to
check out an engine noise?

22:00.132 --> 22:01.759
It's been
driving me crazy.

22:01.834 --> 22:03.665
I told her that
there's no noise.

22:03.736 --> 22:06.569
Well, maybe if you cleared
the wax out of your ears.

22:08.674 --> 22:09.732
I don't
hear anything.

22:09.808 --> 22:11.673
I think
it's the fan belt.

22:11.744 --> 22:14.042
Your friend is right. There's
nothing wrong with this.

22:14.113 --> 22:15.137
See?

22:17.116 --> 22:18.811
Everything is
so clean here,

22:18.884 --> 22:20.818
it's like you were
expecting company.

22:21.687 --> 22:24.019
Maybe our company,
Mr. Perkins.

22:25.057 --> 22:27.548
Who tipped you off?
Was it Kenny Miles?

22:27.626 --> 22:31.153
You do a lot of business with
Kenny, sell him old parts?

22:31.230 --> 22:33.994
Yeah, whenever I run
across some junker.

22:35.768 --> 22:37.531
Hey! Hey!

22:38.404 --> 22:40.531
What?
Cut it. Cut it.

22:40.606 --> 22:44.042
No, this is
a VW Fastback.

22:44.109 --> 22:47.636
This is nice, right?
You fixing this up?

22:47.713 --> 22:48.737
Yeah.

22:48.814 --> 22:51.112
Eames, look at the work he's
done on the windshield, here.

22:51.183 --> 22:52.650
This tape job is perfect.

22:52.718 --> 22:56.051
Mmm. This seal looks new.
You put in a new windshield?

22:57.189 --> 22:58.281
That's a two-man job.

22:58.357 --> 22:59.688
It is?
Yeah.

22:59.758 --> 23:00.986
Well,
who helped you?

23:01.060 --> 23:04.552
Oh, I don't have any help.
I can't afford it.

23:04.630 --> 23:05.790
Butch?

23:06.665 --> 23:09.031
Aren't you ready
to come home yet?

23:09.101 --> 23:10.830
In a minute.

23:13.372 --> 23:16.466
So the two of you
live together?

23:16.742 --> 23:19.438
Hey, hey. That's none of your business.

23:27.853 --> 23:31.755
Rose, are these the two detectives
you said you talked to the other day?

23:36.295 --> 23:38.923
Oh, sure, of course.
I didn't...

23:39.598 --> 23:42.123
She's always complaining
about the light in here.

23:45.938 --> 23:50.136
We were just asking Mr. Perkins who
helped him install this windshield.

23:50.209 --> 23:52.973
Did he hire one of the
homeless from the train cut?

23:53.045 --> 23:54.808
No. Rose will tell you,

23:54.880 --> 23:57.542
I have never
gone down there.

23:57.616 --> 24:02.451
That's exactly right. Butch
has his work, and I have mine.

24:02.521 --> 24:04.250
You know, Butch,
your work,

24:04.323 --> 24:07.724
you don't seem to have a lot
of it, except for this car.

24:07.793 --> 24:11.957
You have this temporary registration
for Rose's daughter Jenny.

24:12.564 --> 24:14.122
Is that who you're
fixing the car up for?

24:14.199 --> 24:16.963
Jenny doesn't have
anything to do with this.

24:18.170 --> 24:20.536
Come on, Butch,
I have to make dinner.

24:20.606 --> 24:21.937
You heard her.
Let's go.

24:22.007 --> 24:25.340
You better move that thing out
before I drop the door on it.

24:29.715 --> 24:35.051
Ms. Cahill, your tuna fish, your recipe,

24:35.354 --> 24:39.814
I remember it had
mayonnaise and green onions,

24:39.892 --> 24:42.224
but there was
something else...

24:42.661 --> 24:44.094
She changes it
every week.

24:44.163 --> 24:45.425
No. Um...

24:45.998 --> 24:48.023
Pickles, the sour ones?

24:49.301 --> 24:50.768
I'm not sure.

24:52.004 --> 24:54.029
Sweet pickles, right?

24:56.074 --> 24:59.532
Yes, that's right,
sweet pickles.

24:59.611 --> 25:00.873
Let's go.

25:06.151 --> 25:08.016
They're an
interesting couple.

25:08.086 --> 25:10.577
You mean the killer
and Mrs. Magoo.

25:15.360 --> 25:18.887
Butch never had
a pot to piss in.

25:18.964 --> 25:21.489
He actually used to
live in his garage.

25:21.567 --> 25:25.401
Then about a year ago, he started
bringing me a steady supply of parts,

25:26.138 --> 25:30.438
Crown Vics, Impalas, a pretty
nice mix of American sedans.

25:30.509 --> 25:32.136
Did he tell you where
he was getting them?

25:32.211 --> 25:35.510
No, no. And I never
thought to ask.

25:35.581 --> 25:39.608
But my client would never knowingly
buy or sell stolen car parts.

25:44.656 --> 25:48.023
Homeless men steal cars, and
Mr. Perkins sells car parts,

25:48.093 --> 25:51.529
both ends of the food chain
with no connective tissue.

25:51.997 --> 25:54.329
I wouldn't call this
a case, Detectives.

25:54.399 --> 25:56.264
The connective tissue
is Rose Cahill.

25:56.335 --> 25:58.303
She fed the same
homeless men

25:58.370 --> 26:00.338
who are turning up
dead or missing.

26:01.106 --> 26:03.472
Any chance of turning
her on Mr. Perkins?

26:03.542 --> 26:05.476
Well, I'm not sure
how reliable she is.

26:05.544 --> 26:06.977
Her memory lapses,

26:07.045 --> 26:10.014
her spasticity when she
tried to open the plastic tub,

26:10.082 --> 26:12.550
it could be
symptoms of a stroke.

26:12.618 --> 26:15.416
I've seen my mother. I know
what a stroke victims look like.

26:15.487 --> 26:18.422
Well, these would be
multiple mini-strokes.

26:18.891 --> 26:23.385
They're harder to detect and
the effects accumulate over time.

26:24.029 --> 26:27.157
Could this be what's driving this
scheme, a need to pay medical bills?

26:27.232 --> 26:30.895
Her insurance records show she's been
to the doctor once in the last 10 years.

26:31.570 --> 26:34.198
Two years ago, people from her
church brought her to a clinic,

26:34.273 --> 26:38.266
she had dizziness and nausea,
but there was no diagnosis.

26:39.444 --> 26:42.675
A doctor examined her, but she left
before they could run any tests.

26:42.748 --> 26:44.807
She might not even know
there's anything wrong with her.

26:44.883 --> 26:46.282
Wouldn't her boyfriend
have noticed?

26:46.351 --> 26:49.013
Well, he knows she
has memory lapses,

26:49.888 --> 26:52.550
he was feeding
her answers,

26:52.624 --> 26:55.855
but that could easily
be blamed on fatigue.

26:56.295 --> 27:00.129
Hmm. In the morning, when we talked
to her, she was sharp as a tack.

27:02.367 --> 27:05.200
There must be something
else driving this.

27:05.504 --> 27:09.668
You know, Rose, she never
told her church group

27:09.741 --> 27:13.199
that she had a daughter up
until a year and a half ago.

27:16.048 --> 27:19.711
Then a couple of months later,
Butch starts stealing cars.

27:19.785 --> 27:23.016
The long-lost daughter's putting
the squeeze on her sick mom?

27:23.088 --> 27:26.683
If that's where the money's
going, talk to this girl.

27:26.758 --> 27:28.658
As soon as
we find her.

27:30.595 --> 27:32.563
Loads of
Jennifer Cahills,

27:32.631 --> 27:35.964
but none with a birth certificate
naming Rose as her mother.

27:36.034 --> 27:38.867
There's not even a record
Rose was ever married.

27:38.937 --> 27:41.929
Yeah. That's it.
Can you fax it?

27:42.007 --> 27:44.066
Yeah, same number as
last time. Thank you.

27:45.077 --> 27:47.477
Butch bought a new
cell phone a year ago.

27:47.546 --> 27:49.104
He registered it
in Jenny's name.

27:50.048 --> 27:52.016
He bought a hundred dollars'
worth of prepaid calls.

27:52.084 --> 27:55.247
My contact at the phone
company says there's $93 left.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.151
A woman of few words.

27:59.958 --> 28:04.122
There's no outgoing calls, just four
incoming, in the last nine months.

28:04.196 --> 28:06.357
It's a minute or less,
probably went to voicemail.

28:06.431 --> 28:08.399
Well, these three, they're
from Butch's garage.

28:08.467 --> 28:10.435
Let's try
the other one.

28:16.208 --> 28:17.368
Hello?

28:18.176 --> 28:20.440
Uh, sorry,
wrong number.

28:21.213 --> 28:23.306
An apartment
rental agency.

28:24.249 --> 28:28.913
Jenny Cahill. Her stepfather filled
out an application for her a year ago.

28:29.554 --> 28:31.954
When you say stepfather,
you mean Butch Perkins?

28:32.024 --> 28:34.754
Yes. He said Jenny was gonna
be moving back into the city.

28:34.826 --> 28:36.953
He wanted to have an
apartment ready for her.

28:37.029 --> 28:39.224
You know where
she's living now?

28:39.297 --> 28:40.321
Upstate, I think.

28:40.399 --> 28:42.458
These requirements
for the apartment,

28:43.268 --> 28:46.897
grab bars in the bathroom, a
place close to the hospital.

28:48.707 --> 28:51.403
Did Mr. Perkins tell you
what was wrong with Jenny?

28:51.476 --> 28:53.569
Just that she's
in bad health.

28:53.645 --> 28:55.476
It's sad,
a young woman like her.

28:55.547 --> 28:57.845
He said she was
in her early 30s.

28:57.916 --> 29:01.647
Now, these money orders were
for deposits on the apartment.

29:01.720 --> 29:04.382
Yes. Mr. Perkins put a
hold on a couple of places,

29:04.456 --> 29:06.720
but the young lady kept
changing her mind.

29:06.792 --> 29:10.284
You spoke with her. We saw you
made a call to her cell phone.

29:11.029 --> 29:14.726
That wasn't me. I let Mr.
Perkins use my phone to call her.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.529
But I don't think he
was able to reach her.

29:18.503 --> 29:20.130
Excuse me?
Thanks.

29:21.073 --> 29:22.472
Apartment rentals...

29:22.541 --> 29:24.168
A daughter who never
uses her cell phone,

29:24.242 --> 29:25.573
never moves
into an apartment

29:25.644 --> 29:28.477
and doesn't even have
a birth certificate.

29:29.581 --> 29:33.415
Rose was 23 when she started
working at the county clerk's office.

29:34.719 --> 29:37.552
I wonder if she ever
took maternity leave.

29:41.159 --> 29:44.094
<i>I spent half my life at a
desk sitting next to Rose.</i>

29:44.162 --> 29:46.790
I don't want to betray her confidence.

29:46.865 --> 29:51.666
Well, look, 30 years
ago, she wasn't married,

29:51.736 --> 29:53.101
she was still
living at home,

29:53.171 --> 29:55.036
she got pregnant,
isn't that right?

29:55.107 --> 29:56.734
You could've knocked
me over with a feather.

29:56.808 --> 29:58.605
Rose never went
anywhere.

29:58.677 --> 30:00.372
She even ate lunch
at her desk.

30:01.079 --> 30:04.412
I still can't figure out how
she managed to get pregnant.

30:04.483 --> 30:05.848
How did you find out?

30:05.917 --> 30:08.078
From her. She was
pretty confused.

30:08.153 --> 30:10.383
I guess she thought
I could help her.

30:10.455 --> 30:12.719
She wanted to have
an abortion?

30:12.791 --> 30:14.691
She didn't actually
say that.

30:14.759 --> 30:17.922
It was 1972. It was still the Dark Ages.

30:17.996 --> 30:19.395
What did she do?

30:19.464 --> 30:21.056
I gave her
some names.

30:21.433 --> 30:24.493
And about a month later, I
thought she was starting to show.

30:25.270 --> 30:29.104
But then a few weeks passed
and that little tummy went away.

30:30.909 --> 30:32.103
What happened?

30:32.177 --> 30:34.338
Did she have a miscarriage?
She had an abortion?

30:34.412 --> 30:35.709
Well, I asked her.

30:35.780 --> 30:37.975
She just said that she made a mistake

30:38.049 --> 30:40.574
and that she'd never
been pregnant after all.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.581
I didn't push it.

30:44.990 --> 30:47.015
And she never
brought it up again?

30:47.125 --> 30:50.959
No. Rose just
folded back on herself.

30:53.398 --> 30:55.366
That thing is fixed
for good now.

30:55.433 --> 30:56.695
Oh, thank you, Butch.

30:56.768 --> 30:57.996
Uh-huh.

30:59.905 --> 31:04.808
You know, Dad re-tiled that
bathroom himself in 1965.

31:06.044 --> 31:07.602
And Mom picked
the pattern.

31:07.679 --> 31:10.842
Those two, they really
fit together, didn't they?

31:10.916 --> 31:12.645
Like two doves
in a nest.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.918
Poor Jenny, she's so
lonely where she is.

31:19.724 --> 31:20.952
I know.

31:24.963 --> 31:27.090
We'll take
good care of her.

31:28.200 --> 31:32.364
Rose, please
don't worry about it.

31:40.712 --> 31:42.043
This woman
was a church mouse.

31:42.113 --> 31:44.411
She was probably mortified she
got pregnant in the first place.

31:44.482 --> 31:46.677
And now it's all
come back to haunt her.

31:46.751 --> 31:49.743
Well, her mini-strokes
might have sparked it.

31:49.988 --> 31:51.888
In her dementia,

31:51.957 --> 31:55.984
her guilt and shame might
be expressing themselves

31:56.061 --> 31:59.963
by talking about Jenny as
if she's a living person.

32:00.031 --> 32:01.396
A living person
who needs help.

32:01.466 --> 32:04.333
And Mr. Perkins has
bought into this delusion.

32:04.402 --> 32:05.767
No, it's not a delusion.

32:05.837 --> 32:09.329
Delusions are firmly believed
by the people who have them.

32:09.407 --> 32:12.638
Rose has an early form of dementia.

32:13.511 --> 32:15.308
In the mornings,
when she's lucid,

32:15.380 --> 32:17.211
she knows that
there's no Jenny.

32:17.282 --> 32:21.719
It's later on in the day, when
she gets tired, she gets confused.

32:21.820 --> 32:25.312
Then when she's lucid, why doesn't
she just tell Mr. Perkins the truth?

32:26.591 --> 32:28.786
Well, that's
a good question.

32:29.127 --> 32:30.389
Thank you.

32:31.129 --> 32:33.859
I suggest you get
an answer quickly.

32:38.637 --> 32:40.127
Mall security was
about to tow them

32:40.205 --> 32:41.968
when they got a smell
from the trunk.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.735
The cars haven't moved since Friday.

32:43.808 --> 32:46.902
Two Crown Vics bought at auction
Thursday over in Fort Lee.

32:46.978 --> 32:48.172
Pardon me.

32:49.547 --> 32:52.516
It's the same pattern.
Plastic shards.

32:52.584 --> 32:54.142
We need all these
trash cans checked.

32:54.219 --> 32:56.881
If they've been emptied, we
need to know where it went.

32:57.622 --> 32:59.852
Last Thursday is when we talked to Rose.

32:59.924 --> 33:02.916
Butch must've already bought
these when he found out.

33:04.029 --> 33:05.428
Dinnertime.

33:06.231 --> 33:08.791
I wonder what alibi
they're serving.

33:11.870 --> 33:13.861
Hi.
No squeak today.

33:14.506 --> 33:17.134
I think it stops the minute it
figures out we're coming here.

33:17.208 --> 33:19.005
I don't have time
to talk to you.

33:19.077 --> 33:21.045
Oh, we're actually here
to talk to Rose.

33:22.614 --> 33:26.050
You know, you're right about the
light in here. It's really bad.

33:27.952 --> 33:31.115
Don't you cops have
something better to do?

33:32.123 --> 33:34.717
You recognize us now,
don't you, Rose?

33:36.594 --> 33:39.290
Oh, yes, yes, of course, the detectives.

33:39.631 --> 33:41.258
We need to show you
a picture,

33:41.333 --> 33:43.801
see if you remember this
person from the train cut.

33:43.868 --> 33:46.735
We found him in the trunk of a Crown Vic

33:46.805 --> 33:49.638
that was bought at a car
auction last Thursday.

33:50.075 --> 33:51.770
I can't place him.

33:51.843 --> 33:54.505
Last Thursday, that's the day
we talked to you at the church.

33:54.579 --> 33:55.637
Where were you, Butch?

33:55.714 --> 33:56.874
I was here, working.

33:56.948 --> 33:58.108
Can anybody
verify that?

33:58.183 --> 34:00.083
Did anybody call
or stop in?

34:00.151 --> 34:04.178
No. Rose was here.
She came from church.

34:05.056 --> 34:07.081
Oh! Oh, yes, I did.

34:07.158 --> 34:08.648
You did?
Yes.

34:08.726 --> 34:14.529
And what about that big tuna
fish bowl I carried to your car?

34:14.599 --> 34:17.500
I guess you just let that
sit in the back of your wagon?

34:17.569 --> 34:19.469
All that mayonnaise
baking in the sun.

34:19.536 --> 34:22.005
I bet that went over big
at the women's shelter.

34:22.072 --> 34:25.304
That's right. I did go to the shelter.

34:25.377 --> 34:29.005
Sure, just before
you came here.

34:29.347 --> 34:32.646
No, no, no. No, you missed your chance.

34:34.119 --> 34:37.054
No, she wasn't here.
You weren't here, either.

34:37.121 --> 34:38.714
You were at the auction with him.

34:38.790 --> 34:41.281
No, I was here
with Rose.

34:41.359 --> 34:43.088
You'll need a better
witness than that.

34:43.995 --> 34:47.396
We've got people sifting
through garbage in Yonkers

34:47.465 --> 34:50.228
looking for a soda bottle
with a bullet hole in it.

34:50.301 --> 34:54.431
Fingerprints or DNA, you so much
as breathed on it, you're done.

34:54.505 --> 34:56.599
This is nuts.
We were here.

34:58.410 --> 34:59.570
Yeah, well,
it's funny.

34:59.644 --> 35:02.943
You just have to put yourself
in our shoes, you know?

35:03.014 --> 35:04.743
You said you were here all afternoon.

35:04.816 --> 35:09.185
You say nobody stopped
in, no phone rang.

35:11.990 --> 35:14.015
What are we
gonna think?

35:15.193 --> 35:18.959
You just don't wander too far
from the ranch, there, Butch, okay?

35:19.030 --> 35:20.429
Because we'll be back.

35:20.498 --> 35:21.795
You know, it's too bad about that,

35:21.866 --> 35:25.893
because I think Jenny would
have really enjoyed driving it.

35:34.045 --> 35:35.137
Rose,

35:36.915 --> 35:43.150
when did Jenny call you
here? Wasn't that Thursday?

35:43.221 --> 35:45.189
Isn't that when
you talked to her?

35:46.057 --> 35:50.050
Where is my brain? Of course,
she called Thursday afternoon.

35:51.029 --> 35:53.054
She called you
from where?

35:53.765 --> 35:56.165
From the hospital
near where she lives.

35:56.234 --> 35:59.101
She goes in several times
a week for treatment.

35:59.204 --> 36:03.834
Treatment? For what?
Cancer or kidney disease?

36:03.908 --> 36:06.638
I don't know about that
stuff. You tell them, Rose.

36:06.711 --> 36:12.081
Jenny, she's sick,
she gets so cold...

36:12.383 --> 36:15.375
Well, let's call her? If she confirms
she talked to you on Thursday...

36:15.453 --> 36:19.150
You can't call her. Up where she
lives, she doesn't have a phone,

36:19.224 --> 36:20.623
she can't afford it.

36:20.692 --> 36:22.557
What about the phone
that you gave her?

36:22.627 --> 36:25.391
She doesn't like to use it.
It's probably broken, anyway.

36:25.463 --> 36:28.694
Look, Rose and I
will call Jenny,

36:28.766 --> 36:31.701
and she'll straighten out where we were.

36:32.103 --> 36:35.095
I don't understand the
problem with this girl. Do you?

36:36.374 --> 36:39.343
It's just not making sense,
Butch. You know?

36:41.546 --> 36:44.174
You gotta be making it up, aren't you?

36:46.184 --> 36:47.742
Rose, I'm gonna
tell them.

36:47.819 --> 36:48.877
Tell us what?

36:50.622 --> 36:52.419
Jenny's a
drug addict,

36:52.490 --> 36:55.050
and she has health
problems because of that.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.250
She's trying
to kick it,

36:57.328 --> 37:00.695
that's why she spends so
much time with herself.

37:01.165 --> 37:02.826
So you're just
trying to help Jenny?

37:02.901 --> 37:07.235
That's why you gave her
the phone, I guess, the car,

37:07.305 --> 37:09.068
the apartment, so that she gets clean?

37:09.140 --> 37:12.405
Yeah, it's little things,
you know, whatever we can.

37:12.477 --> 37:14.775
Rose told you about
Jenny being an addict?

37:16.147 --> 37:18.479
She didn't have
to spell it out.

37:18.850 --> 37:21.045
Look, I've been looking
for this girl,

37:21.119 --> 37:25.488
and people who don't want to be
found usually have a good reason.

37:25.557 --> 37:28.890
They're not proud of
what it is they're doing.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.326
And Rose has never
wanted to talk about it.

37:31.396 --> 37:33.762
She's always been a
little ashamed of her.

37:33.831 --> 37:39.133
But I think that we
should give Jenny a chance,

37:39.203 --> 37:41.535
just like Rose
gave me a chance.

37:42.440 --> 37:47.742
Yeah. And you
actually believe this.

37:51.449 --> 37:53.644
Were you ever
gonna tell him?

37:54.052 --> 37:56.714
I don't have anything
more to say about this.

37:57.522 --> 38:00.650
Butch loves me,
and he loves Jenny.

38:00.725 --> 38:04.354
Rose, you ever wonder why your
hands are always so slippery?

38:05.330 --> 38:09.061
And that your mind can't hold
onto things like it used to?

38:09.133 --> 38:11.101
That's just
getting old.

38:11.703 --> 38:13.330
You haven't told him

38:13.404 --> 38:15.463
when they brought you
to the clinic,

38:15.540 --> 38:18.134
when you got
dizziness, nausea.

38:18.576 --> 38:20.441
How did you hear
about that?

38:20.511 --> 38:22.502
If you hadn't left,
they would have told you,

38:22.580 --> 38:25.276
you probably had a
series of small strokes.

38:26.517 --> 38:29.247
That's why you get
so confused, you know,

38:29.320 --> 38:32.221
you get tired
and you see things

38:32.290 --> 38:35.123
from the past as if
they're in the present.

38:36.761 --> 38:38.752
You know, like Jenny.

38:43.301 --> 38:48.238
You got pregnant 32 two years
ago, but you never gave birth.

38:50.575 --> 38:52.338
What are you saying?

38:53.778 --> 38:55.177
No Jenny, Butch.

38:56.147 --> 38:58.707
No one to lie for you
about your phone call.

38:58.783 --> 39:01.980
I don't need anybody to
lie for me. Jenny's real.

39:03.488 --> 39:05.956
Rose would've told me.
She's not crazy.

39:06.024 --> 39:08.185
We talked to people
who knew her back then.

39:08.259 --> 39:11.456
They said she never carried
the pregnancy to term.

39:13.831 --> 39:16.425
Rose, what is she
talking about?

39:16.934 --> 39:19.562
Now, you told me
she was lonely,

39:19.637 --> 39:21.264
that she needed
our help.

39:22.273 --> 39:25.208
Butch, please,
I didn't lie.

39:28.279 --> 39:32.579
Ask her what she did with the
phone you gave to her for Jenny.

39:33.518 --> 39:37.249
Rose, tell me that you have a daughter,

39:37.321 --> 39:40.290
that you have a real living daughter.

39:40.692 --> 39:42.922
And the money that you
gave her to help Jenny,

39:42.994 --> 39:45.462
the money that you
made stealing cars,

39:45.530 --> 39:46.690
ask her what
she did with it.

39:46.764 --> 39:48.755
I didn't steal anything.

39:50.034 --> 39:52.798
Rose, answer me!

39:53.137 --> 39:56.038
Butch, you love me.

39:56.107 --> 39:59.372
Oh, he loves you to
death. To nine deaths.

40:08.119 --> 40:09.984
You know,
those homeless men

40:10.054 --> 40:11.988
who were his helpers,
that disappeared?

40:12.056 --> 40:13.421
What did you do?

40:14.959 --> 40:19.658
Did you close your eyes and
imagine that they were kittens?

40:19.731 --> 40:21.699
That they were just
drowning kittens?

40:21.766 --> 40:23.666
No, no,
don't say that.

40:23.735 --> 40:28.365
Because you were too ashamed to tell
him the truth about your abortion?

40:31.409 --> 40:34.572
No, I didn't do that
to Jenny.

40:34.645 --> 40:36.704
I couldn't do that to her.

40:37.215 --> 40:40.082
What happened, Rose,
did you miscarry?

40:41.052 --> 40:42.041
No.

40:44.522 --> 40:49.016
You lost that baby, Rose, you
were pregnant and you lost her.

40:49.560 --> 40:53.189
No, I didn't.
I never lost Jenny.

41:07.745 --> 41:09.076
Your hands.

41:13.484 --> 41:15.452
You're protecting Jenny.

41:20.858 --> 41:22.723
She's still inside you.

41:26.330 --> 41:29.128
And that's why you left the clinic
before they could make the tests

41:29.200 --> 41:31.430
and before they
could do x-rays.

41:32.603 --> 41:34.070
Oh, my God.

41:34.806 --> 41:36.603
What are you saying?

41:36.674 --> 41:38.699
The baby died inside you.

41:41.913 --> 41:43.380
And it calcified.

41:46.117 --> 41:47.709
A stone baby.

41:51.122 --> 41:53.955
She was so cold
and lonely.

41:55.193 --> 41:57.423
I should have never given up on her.

41:57.495 --> 41:59.326
It was a rotten
thing to do.

42:00.264 --> 42:03.461
Oh, jeez,
what did I do?

42:04.435 --> 42:05.902
Oh, Butch.

42:07.572 --> 42:11.565
Butch, hold me.
Hold me.

42:13.444 --> 42:17.175
He killed those men
to help Jenny.

42:18.716 --> 42:22.174
I didn't want him to.
I didn't want the money.

42:23.321 --> 42:25.448
You couldn't tell him
the truth?

42:25.923 --> 42:28.050
Then he'd see what I am,

42:28.926 --> 42:31.918
a coffin, a tomb.

42:34.131 --> 42:36.599
Butch, you're under arrest for murder.

43:04.762 --> 43:07.287
I'm gonna need to
see my nephew later.

43:08.199 --> 43:12.033
The Dark Ages, sometimes I
think we're still living in them.
