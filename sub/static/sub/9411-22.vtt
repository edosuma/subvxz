18:26.800 --> 18:29.300
Benjy, run.

18:39.733 --> 18:42.167
"Fly amino acid."

It's only skin.

[ Buzzing ]

19:22.900 --> 19:25.400
What's that buzzing sound?

19:25.400 --> 19:30.500
I don't have a clue, but we're not
sticking around to find out.

19:32.933 --> 19:35.933
- Hurry up, guys. Bus leaves in five minutes.
- [ Children Chattering ]

19:39.200 --> 19:42.200
I wonder where Mr. Blankenship is.

19:43.633 --> 19:45.567
Think we should say anything?

19:45.567 --> 19:48.867
Oh, right. You think they
laughed about the lizard bunny?

19:48.867 --> 19:51.900
Try telling them that the science
teacher was a man-eating snake.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.333
Yeah, I see what you mean.

19:55.333 --> 20:00.267
Not one bite the whole trip, and in the
last 10 minutes I've been bitten 10 times.

20:00.267 --> 20:03.233
Me too. And I'm getting
some kind of skin rash.

I'm glad that's over.

Old Blankenship won't
be bugging us anymore.
