00:43.986 --> 00:46.865
In San Rafael, California,
north of San Francisco,

00:46.956 --> 00:49.630
a judge and three other persons
were shot to death today

00:49.692 --> 00:52.138
in an attempt
by a group of convicts to escape.

00:55.865 --> 00:57.401
There are still a great many loose ends

00:57.533 --> 01:00.571
and a great deal of speculation
about what happened here.

01:01.504 --> 01:05.577
Investigators will now try to determine
if there was a conspiracy of some kind

01:05.641 --> 01:08.053
that involved, perhaps, more persons

01:08.111 --> 01:10.614
than those who actually
participated in the bloody event.

01:12.982 --> 01:16.486
Today, it turned out that two of the guns
used in the courtroom

01:16.552 --> 01:18.828
were bought by Angela Davis.

01:18.888 --> 01:22.961
She was the teacher fired from the
University of California at Los Angeles,

01:23.025 --> 01:25.596
after she said, yes, she was a communist.

02:09.472 --> 02:11.611
I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama.

02:12.675 --> 02:18.216
I think we all realized that this was not
the way things were supposed to be.

02:18.614 --> 02:20.491
And my mother used to say that.

02:20.616 --> 02:22.425
My father had guns in the house.

02:23.619 --> 02:26.190
And we all knew that when they came out,

02:26.255 --> 02:30.032
generally, it was in response to some threat.

02:32.094 --> 02:36.270
As much as I wanted to see change happen,

02:36.332 --> 02:39.108
I left the South precisely at the moment

02:39.168 --> 02:42.513
when radical change
was about to take place.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.717
I discovered a new program

02:46.776 --> 02:52.488
to bring black students from
the segregated South to the North.

02:53.683 --> 02:56.789
So, I didn't get to directly experience,

02:57.353 --> 03:01.597
you know, all of the protests in Birmingham.

03:06.495 --> 03:10.739
I attended Elisabeth Irwin High School
in New York

03:12.101 --> 03:17.380
and went to Brandeis. There were
very few black students there.

03:17.573 --> 03:22.249
And then, of course,
I ended up studying in Germany

03:22.878 --> 03:26.416
when these new developments
in the black movement happened,

03:26.582 --> 03:29.153
the emergence of the Black Panther Party.

03:29.252 --> 03:32.790
And my feeling was that, "I wanna be there.

03:32.855 --> 03:37.565
"This is earth-shaking. This is change.
I wanna be a part of that."

03:43.699 --> 03:48.409
Revolution is about thinking about
things in a radically different way.

03:48.471 --> 03:51.281
And, I think, given the history of America,

03:51.340 --> 03:55.811
the idea that black people
should be equal, and really equal,

03:55.878 --> 03:57.824
was a revolutionary thing.

04:01.117 --> 04:07.534
In America, black people are treated
very much as the Vietnamese people.

04:07.590 --> 04:09.365
And the police, they are not to...

04:09.425 --> 04:12.838
In our community,
are not to promote our welfare,

04:12.962 --> 04:15.238
or our security and our safety.

04:15.331 --> 04:20.110
But they are there to contain us,
to brutalize us and murder us.

04:20.503 --> 04:24.974
Do you know what Black Power means?

04:27.076 --> 04:30.649
Black Power means dignity.

04:31.881 --> 04:35.385
The fact is that some of our fellow
citizens have turned against our society

04:35.451 --> 04:37.192
and turned against our government.

04:37.253 --> 04:38.857
People, perhaps, that you do not see,

04:38.921 --> 04:41.561
people that, perhaps,
you do not come in contact with,

04:41.624 --> 04:45.197
and the fact you can't get a job. Only
40% of the men that live in the ghetto

04:45.261 --> 04:47.901
have jobs that pay more than $60 a week.

04:47.963 --> 04:51.069
How can you support a family?
How can you bring up children in dignity?

04:53.002 --> 04:56.142
The Panthers,
if you look at their 10-point program,

04:56.205 --> 05:00.210
it's about jobs, it's about education,
it's about equality.

05:00.276 --> 05:03.382
And the point that everyone remembers
is the self-defense.

05:06.916 --> 05:11.194
The Panthers, they not only had guns,
they wanted you to know they had guns.

05:13.489 --> 05:17.835
Exhibit A was when they burst into
a session of the state legislature.

05:20.730 --> 05:22.539
The Black Panther Party for Self Defense

05:22.540 --> 05:24.440
calls upon the American
people in general,

05:24.533 --> 05:26.137
and the black people in particular,

05:26.235 --> 05:29.808
to take careful note
of the racist California legislature

05:29.872 --> 05:31.977
which is now considering legislation

05:32.041 --> 05:35.113
aimed at keeping the black people
disarmed and powerless

05:35.177 --> 05:39.216
at the very same time racist police
agencies throughout the country

05:39.281 --> 05:44.287
are intensifying the terror, brutality,
murder and repression of black people.

05:51.193 --> 05:53.969
All of these police were summoned,
and what they found

05:54.430 --> 05:57.172
was, indeed,
the Panthers were not breaking any law.

06:01.604 --> 06:07.077
I saw the photograph of the
Black Panther Party in some newspaper

06:07.143 --> 06:09.521
when I was studying in Germany.

06:09.779 --> 06:13.522
And again, I had this sense,
"The world is changing.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.995
"My world is changing,
and I do want to be a part of this. "

06:17.853 --> 06:21.130
And I decided that I would go back.

06:21.190 --> 06:25.104
I would go back
and I decided to go to San Diego,

06:25.294 --> 06:28.104
which was where Marcuse was.

06:33.102 --> 06:38.347
Herbert Marcuse was
an amazing philosopher.

06:41.377 --> 06:44.790
The important message I got from him

06:44.880 --> 06:49.420
was that knowledge
can help to transform the world.

06:49.552 --> 06:53.864
That knowledge does not exist
in a dimension of its own,

06:53.989 --> 06:57.698
but rather it can be active,
it can be practical.

07:00.129 --> 07:02.700
Angela Davis is possibly

07:02.798 --> 07:07.076
the most intelligent person
that I have ever been around,

07:07.136 --> 07:10.276
when it comes to studying
classical German philosophy.

07:11.407 --> 07:15.184
She had been a very, very
good student at Brandeis,

07:15.244 --> 07:18.248
and she had gone to Germany
to the Frankfurt School.

07:18.380 --> 07:22.294
She became, you know, part of
an international intellectual community.

07:23.152 --> 07:27.567
Her intellectual engagement,
as the most important thing in her life,

07:27.623 --> 07:30.297
was clearly mapped out at that point.

07:31.727 --> 07:35.937
She smoked Gauloises, chain-smoked
them, was very European.

07:35.998 --> 07:42.938
And she came out of that heavy
intellectual atmosphere rise in San Diego

07:43.939 --> 07:46.545
that was just the beginnings
of the Black Panthers,

07:46.609 --> 07:49.089
the wake of the riots, and so on.

07:49.144 --> 07:52.614
So, she wasn't really wired into that

07:52.681 --> 07:55.855
and hadn't had a lot of
personal experience, I think, with it.

07:57.419 --> 08:00.997
When I had attempted
to become involved in

08:00.998 --> 08:03.598
political organizations in San Diego,

08:03.726 --> 08:05.933
I had not had very much success.

08:05.995 --> 08:08.498
Some people thought I was an agent.

08:08.564 --> 08:12.011
You know, who was this black woman
who's coming from Europe

08:12.067 --> 08:14.911
and wanting to know
what's going on in the community?

08:17.540 --> 08:20.453
But I realized that I needed a collective.

08:20.509 --> 08:25.254
I needed people to engage with.

08:25.314 --> 08:26.884
I needed to...

08:26.949 --> 08:32.058
I didn't see myself accomplishing
anything important as an individual.

08:32.388 --> 08:35.426
Said I wanted freedom
Freedom!

08:35.957 --> 08:37.198
Black is beautiful

08:37.293 --> 08:41.434
Angela Davis wanted to be a part
of the Black Power movement.

08:41.630 --> 08:44.770
I was the section leader
of the Black Panther Party.

08:44.867 --> 08:47.143
And I asked Angela

08:47.236 --> 08:49.773
to participate in the educational

08:50.072 --> 08:53.110
that I was conducting on Marxism
to my cadre.

08:53.676 --> 08:57.920
That was the extent of her involvement.

08:58.581 --> 09:02.427
I had gotten involved, very briefly,
with the Black Panther Party,

09:02.885 --> 09:05.388
Black Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee,

09:05.454 --> 09:08.367
the black student organization
on my campus,

09:08.557 --> 09:12.198
but I did not like the nationalism,
I did not like the male supremacy,

09:12.294 --> 09:17.175
I did not like the fact that women were
expected to take a back seat

09:17.232 --> 09:21.738
and, literally, to sit at the feet of the men.

09:22.237 --> 09:26.379
So it was really refreshing to meet
someone like Franklin Alexander

09:26.542 --> 09:29.250
and Franklin's wife, Kendra.

09:29.845 --> 09:32.985
I think, basically, what we're doing is

09:33.048 --> 09:36.120
we're saying that this system
is rotten at its core,

09:36.719 --> 09:42.294
while we fight for the immediate needs
of the people, constantly and continually.

09:42.358 --> 09:45.567
Better housing, you know,
the end of police brutality.

09:45.694 --> 09:49.665
Stopping the depression level of
unemployment in the black community.

09:49.765 --> 09:52.006
And while we continue
to do those kinds of things,

09:52.101 --> 09:56.880
we do know, in fact, that this
system itself creates those conditions.

09:57.406 --> 09:59.443
The changing of those conditions

09:59.508 --> 10:02.819
basically means establishing
a socialist society.

10:03.245 --> 10:07.022
The Che Lumumba Club was
an open Communist Party club.

10:07.149 --> 10:10.858
And the purpose of it was
to allow the Communist Party

10:11.286 --> 10:14.392
to openly operate
inside the Black Power movement.

10:16.191 --> 10:19.729
I don't know whether I would've joined
the Communist Party at that time,

10:19.795 --> 10:23.140
had not the Che Lumumba Club existed.

10:23.198 --> 10:25.439
You know, Che Guevara, Patrice Lumumba,

10:25.501 --> 10:29.210
sort of symbolic of the global revolution

10:29.304 --> 10:33.150
you know, very specifically Third World
people, people of color.

10:33.242 --> 10:35.688
And that was
what really drew me into the party.

10:36.645 --> 10:38.522
We have to talk about being radical.

10:38.580 --> 10:43.996
And radical means, etymologically,
you know, to get things at their root.

10:44.586 --> 10:48.193
It's very interesting. The white people
have been called radicals for a long time.

10:48.257 --> 10:51.636
And black people have been called
militants, you know?

10:51.694 --> 10:55.699
As if black people can't be radicals, too.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.474
But if we don't fight now,

10:58.534 --> 11:02.175
we'll never be able to put into practice
that slogan

11:02.237 --> 11:04.717
which, I think, crystallizes
what we've been talking about,

11:04.773 --> 11:06.810
and that is all the power to the people.

11:26.662 --> 11:32.044
I was invited to apply
for this position at UCLA.

11:32.501 --> 11:38.417
They needed someone
who was trained in continental philosophy

11:39.074 --> 11:42.078
and who could teach Marxism.

11:42.811 --> 11:44.290
I decided to accept the job.

11:49.151 --> 11:51.688
There had been an article

11:51.754 --> 11:56.294
written by a man who had joined
the Communist Party,

11:56.492 --> 11:59.371
but, actually, he was an FBI agent.

12:01.997 --> 12:07.071
And then after that,
a well-known reactionary reporter

12:07.236 --> 12:12.151
in Northern California
wrote a scathing article about me.

12:13.008 --> 12:15.750
And that's when all hell broke loose.

12:18.914 --> 12:21.758
Yesterday was the first day
of the fall term at UCLA,

12:21.817 --> 12:23.524
and philosophy professor, Angela Davis,

12:23.585 --> 12:27.089
was on her way to teach her first class
amid controversy,

12:27.256 --> 12:30.396
for Miss Davis admitted that she is
a member of the Communist Party.

12:30.726 --> 12:34.037
And the regents who run the university
decided, because of that,

12:34.096 --> 12:36.167
she should not be allowed to teach.

12:36.498 --> 12:39.445
For UCLA, it has
become the crisis of the year.

12:42.004 --> 12:44.416
I had known Angela as a child.

12:44.573 --> 12:47.383
I went down there,
and I hadn't seen her in years,

12:47.476 --> 12:51.049
as we went different ways.
And I went down there

12:51.113 --> 12:53.992
and I asked her, you know,
if I could be of help and so forth.

12:54.716 --> 12:57.856
Her first lecture drew 2,000 students

12:57.920 --> 13:01.925
and was on the philosophy
of Frederick Douglass.

13:03.125 --> 13:04.695
What was your reaction to the lecture?

13:04.827 --> 13:08.001
I think she is a superb lecturer.
You can learn so much.

13:08.063 --> 13:10.907
As I infer from just what she said today,
it was terrific.

13:11.133 --> 13:13.443
Well, I think she's trying to overthrow
our system of government,

13:13.502 --> 13:14.913
and she admits that.

13:15.137 --> 13:18.983
And while I think it is bad to limit
freedom of speech of any group,

13:19.041 --> 13:20.076
because it limits democracy,

13:20.142 --> 13:22.383
I think it is better
to have a limited democracy

13:22.444 --> 13:24.424
that will last for a long, long time,

13:24.479 --> 13:26.720
than complete democracy,
complete freedom,

13:26.782 --> 13:28.489
that lasts only for a brief period.

13:28.650 --> 13:31.028
If I were able to deliver that coherent,
that beautiful

13:31.086 --> 13:33.225
and that intellectual a lecture
on my first time,

13:33.288 --> 13:35.734
to how many thousands of people
there were in that place,

13:35.891 --> 13:37.199
I'd feel like a superstar.

13:37.392 --> 13:40.805
The woman is an admitted member
of the Communist Party.

13:40.863 --> 13:43.571
She also, in her letter to Chancellor Young,

13:43.632 --> 13:45.270
indicated that she felt

13:45.334 --> 13:48.372
that the only way we could bring about
the social change that's necessary today

13:48.437 --> 13:50.246
is through violence and militancy.

13:50.305 --> 13:53.684
I don't think we need that on campus,
and so I'm for getting rid of her.

13:54.276 --> 13:57.587
The regents seem intent
on meting out punishments

13:57.646 --> 14:01.184
which concur with the fascist tendencies
of the times.

14:02.384 --> 14:05.797
The sole reason they give
for their intention to fire me

14:06.288 --> 14:08.962
is my membership in the Communist Party.

14:10.259 --> 14:13.763
I became chancellor of UCLA in 1968.

14:14.196 --> 14:16.005
The main issue at stake was,

14:16.064 --> 14:19.273
I'll use a catchphrase, "academic freedom."

14:19.334 --> 14:22.713
I think that was my main concern,

14:24.940 --> 14:26.419
that while it was appropriate

14:26.508 --> 14:30.820
to make sure that a person was not
misusing or abusing

14:30.879 --> 14:33.325
his or her appointment
as a member of the faculty,

14:33.849 --> 14:36.921
that a person's political views

14:38.086 --> 14:41.932
should not be of concern

14:42.024 --> 14:44.163
with regard to his or her appointment.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.373
But my own personal opinion,
and that's all it can be,

14:47.429 --> 14:48.567
I have no evidence otherwise,

14:48.664 --> 14:50.905
my own personal opinion is

14:50.966 --> 14:54.140
that this entire incident,
starting with the hiring of Miss Davis,

14:54.269 --> 14:55.839
was a deliberate provocation.

14:56.004 --> 15:00.111
It's probably true,
Reagan believed that she was dangerous.

15:00.242 --> 15:06.158
That she would use her bully-pulpit
in the faculty

15:06.281 --> 15:10.229
to indoctrinate students, to try to
win students over to communism,

15:10.285 --> 15:14.199
to try to engage in activities
which would be harmful to the university.

15:15.691 --> 15:18.695
Part of the policy of Governor Reagan

15:18.760 --> 15:21.138
was really to do everything possible

15:21.196 --> 15:27.203
to repress the radical political movement
as they saw it developing.

15:28.003 --> 15:31.280
The Anti-War Movement,
Students for a Democratic Society,

15:31.340 --> 15:33.013
the emergence of the Black Panther Party.

15:33.809 --> 15:38.258
And Angela becomes a symbol of all
of those movements at the same time.

15:39.214 --> 15:41.421
There was no precedent in my life

15:41.483 --> 15:47.798
for this kind of public exposure.

15:48.290 --> 15:51.669
And then, of course,
there were all of the threats.

16:00.769 --> 16:02.680
You know, I was told to go back to Africa,

16:02.738 --> 16:05.412
then I was told to go back to Russia.

16:05.474 --> 16:07.587
And often times, I received

16:07.588 --> 16:10.788
letters saying that
I was gonna be dead by sundown.

16:11.113 --> 16:13.719
And so, my life completely changed.

16:13.982 --> 16:16.519
I bought my first gun

16:16.618 --> 16:19.565
because I really feared that

16:19.621 --> 16:23.262
I might be in a situation where
either the police, or agents

16:23.358 --> 16:25.998
or other people would take my life.

16:26.328 --> 16:28.672
What they're doing to her
is an exaggerated form

16:28.730 --> 16:31.643
of what happens every day
to black people in this country.

16:31.733 --> 16:35.476
And they're saying
to those communities through her

16:35.704 --> 16:38.446
that, you know, people have to
straighten up and fly right

16:38.507 --> 16:39.679
and be good niggers, you know?

16:40.108 --> 16:41.348
I think the first thing we have to do

16:41.410 --> 16:45.517
is certainly make sure that we do have
some unity in the black community,

16:45.580 --> 16:47.582
so that when a sister like that stands up,

16:47.649 --> 16:49.686
that they don't wipe her out as one person,

16:49.751 --> 16:51.230
that they have to wipe out
more than one person.

16:58.460 --> 17:01.930
Being a revolutionary,
some of it was just being young

17:01.997 --> 17:04.068
and being romantic and...

17:04.933 --> 17:07.573
I don't know that we had a real idea

17:07.636 --> 17:12.050
of, you know,
how bloody a revolution could really be.

17:23.885 --> 17:26.627
I was involved
in hundreds of peace marches,

17:26.688 --> 17:30.534
and, I mean, peace marches
against the war in Vietnam

17:30.592 --> 17:32.765
that ended up with the
police beating people up

17:32.766 --> 17:34.166
and tear gassing people.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.371
Malcolm X gets assassinated,

17:40.435 --> 17:44.349
you might expect that 'cause he was
talking about the ballot or the bullet.

17:46.508 --> 17:49.114
But Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy.

17:51.179 --> 17:54.183
There was the beginnings of, on both sides,

17:57.219 --> 18:03.659
a sense that this isn't gonna
be settled at the ballot box or in debates.

18:04.359 --> 18:06.202
This is gonna be war.

18:16.638 --> 18:21.053
Los Angeles, four and a half years
after the rebellion in Watts,

18:21.376 --> 18:23.589
300 Los Angeles policemen

18:23.590 --> 18:26.690
are involved in a raging
gun battle for nearly five hours.

18:27.249 --> 18:30.253
They are assaulting an office
of the Black Panther Party,

18:30.318 --> 18:33.822
the most powerful militant
black organization in the country.

18:35.524 --> 18:39.199
It is apparent that the undeclared war
between the police and the Panthers

18:39.261 --> 18:41.639
has reached alarming proportions.

18:42.197 --> 18:44.700
Party members at 30 chapters
across the country

18:44.766 --> 18:48.304
have stockpiled arsenals of
automatic weapons, shotguns, pistols

18:48.370 --> 18:49.872
and homemade bombs.

18:52.941 --> 18:55.182
Vice President Agnew
has called the Panthers,

18:55.243 --> 18:58.747
"A completely irresponsible,
anarchistic group of criminals."

18:59.080 --> 19:01.253
FBI director Hoover has called them,

19:01.316 --> 19:04.126
"The greatest danger to the internal
security of the country."

19:09.891 --> 19:11.461
Did you know that this was gonna happen?

19:11.726 --> 19:14.206
How was I to know the police were going

19:14.262 --> 19:17.436
to break into the Panther office
at 4:30 in the morning?

19:17.999 --> 19:20.172
They obviously didn't broadcast it.

19:20.368 --> 19:21.779
How did you hear about it?

19:22.604 --> 19:25.084
We got a call from someone who was inside,

19:25.140 --> 19:29.611
who said that the police had come
and had attacked their office.

19:30.712 --> 19:34.785
And what do you plan to do?
Do you plan to act as an intermediary

19:34.849 --> 19:38.319
or in any capacity like that?

19:38.486 --> 19:40.159
- I'll do anything I can.
- Thank you.

19:44.326 --> 19:48.331
It was as if we were living in a state of war.

19:49.864 --> 19:51.639
In a state of siege.

19:53.702 --> 19:58.082
For us, during that period, the
revolution was right around the corner,

19:58.340 --> 20:01.549
and we had to do everything we could
to usher it in.

20:01.876 --> 20:06.723
I'm representing the Che Lumumba Club
of the Communist Party.

20:10.919 --> 20:14.492
There is a conspiracy in the land.

20:14.556 --> 20:18.936
It's a conspiracy to wipe out, to murder

20:18.994 --> 20:23.067
every single Black Panther in America

20:23.331 --> 20:27.711
and to wipe out
the black community as a whole.

20:29.437 --> 20:33.681
Brothers and sisters, this is genocide.
We have to call it by its name.

20:33.742 --> 20:35.688
This is genocide.

20:35.810 --> 20:36.811
Right on.

20:37.646 --> 20:41.822
This conspiracy
to commit murder and genocide

20:41.883 --> 20:47.925
on our people forces us
to exercise our constitutional right

20:48.023 --> 20:52.529
to bear arms
and to use those arms to defend

20:52.627 --> 20:55.403
our community, our families and ourselves.

20:55.497 --> 20:57.170
Power to the people!

21:06.207 --> 21:09.848
The overwhelming majority
of the faculty at UCLA

21:09.911 --> 21:13.358
would have supported the position,
and did support the position I took.

21:13.615 --> 21:17.654
But the majority of the general population,

21:18.286 --> 21:22.166
who don't understand
what academic freedom really is,

21:22.490 --> 21:26.905
had concerns about
Angela Davis as a communist,

21:26.961 --> 21:31.068
Angela Davis as a black,
Angela Davis as a woman,

21:31.232 --> 21:33.234
Angela Davis as an activist.

21:34.869 --> 21:38.146
You couldn't have
put things together with anyone

21:38.206 --> 21:42.780
that would've been more
problem-creating than with Angela Davis.

21:43.745 --> 21:46.988
Today, in a rare action,
the Board of Regents voted 15-6

21:47.048 --> 21:49.688
to overrule the university and fire her.

21:49.818 --> 21:51.855
Governor Reagan voted with the majority.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.227
He said it wasn't
because she's a communist,

21:54.289 --> 21:56.030
but rather because she is unprofessional.

21:57.692 --> 22:01.299
While the regents were voting, Miss
Davis was a few blocks away in a rally

22:01.463 --> 22:05.275
protesting the treatment of black
prisoners in Soledad State Prison.

22:05.467 --> 22:08.414
She sees her dismissal
as a case of political repression

22:08.470 --> 22:11.144
which she may or may not challenge.

22:11.272 --> 22:13.752
I'm gonna keep on struggling
to free the Soledad Brothers

22:13.808 --> 22:15.048
and all political prisoners,

22:15.110 --> 22:17.750
because I think that
what has happened to me

22:17.812 --> 22:22.192
is only a very tiny, minute example
of what is happening to them.

22:22.283 --> 22:26.356
I suppose I just lost that job at UCLA

22:26.521 --> 22:29.900
as a result of
my political opinions and activities.

22:30.058 --> 22:33.870
Some UCLA professors plan
to raise money to pay her salary

22:34.062 --> 22:35.803
so she can continue to teach.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.377
The controversy is not over.

22:39.401 --> 22:43.645
I was still at UCLA
defending my right to teach,

22:43.838 --> 22:47.752
and this case emerged

22:47.809 --> 22:54.749
involving three, then young,
black men at Soledad Prison.

22:55.984 --> 23:02.799
All I could think about was
the image of three black men

23:03.758 --> 23:08.400
walking into a silent courtroom
in the city of Salinas

23:08.563 --> 23:11.305
with chains around their waists,

23:11.766 --> 23:15.373
chains under their crotch,
their hands chained,

23:15.537 --> 23:19.576
while their only crime was having attempted

23:19.641 --> 23:24.386
to organize the human beings
inside the Soledad Prison.

23:24.979 --> 23:27.459
They were the ones who were singled out

23:27.615 --> 23:33.395
to serve as examples to any
and everyone in this country

23:33.721 --> 23:37.168
who dares stands up for the truth.

23:37.225 --> 23:38.704
So, what connected these three men,

23:38.760 --> 23:42.401
and what gave rise to the Soledad
Brothers' case, is that a white guard

23:43.264 --> 23:47.144
was killed in Soledad
by being thrown from an upper tier.

23:47.802 --> 23:50.976
George Jackson, John Clutchette
and Fleeta Drumgo

23:51.206 --> 23:54.312
were very prominent
in the prison reform movement

23:54.542 --> 23:59.013
and were basically singled out
and accused of killing this prison guard.

23:59.447 --> 24:03.054
These individuals,
while they may have been incarcerated

24:04.519 --> 24:06.658
for crimes,

24:06.788 --> 24:12.295
now they have become persecuted
because of their political belief.

24:12.427 --> 24:16.739
I hope the people on this campus realize...

24:16.831 --> 24:21.109
What Angela Davis does is
become a primary spokesman

24:21.202 --> 24:24.411
for a quest to free political prisoners.

24:24.472 --> 24:25.610
We have to start fighting back.

24:25.673 --> 24:29.883
Those three brothers in Soledad Prison
are fighting back.

24:29.978 --> 24:33.653
They'd all been convicted
of relatively minor property crimes.

24:34.749 --> 24:37.525
One of them had been accused
of stealing a television set.

24:38.152 --> 24:41.497
George had been accused of stealing $70.

24:41.990 --> 24:44.834
He had been in solitary confinement
for seven years.

24:45.393 --> 24:46.929
He'd been in prison for 11,

24:46.995 --> 24:49.908
and seven of those years
had been in solitary confinement.

24:50.565 --> 24:52.340
Once he got into prison,

24:52.400 --> 24:56.314
he was a strong-willed,
rebellious personality

24:56.371 --> 24:58.408
who continued to defy authorities.

24:58.473 --> 25:01.977
And then he also found his voice as a writer.

25:02.043 --> 25:05.183
And he studied and he became radicalized.

25:05.246 --> 25:06.782
And, I think, once he emerged

25:06.881 --> 25:11.489
as someone who could
articulate revolutionary ideas,

25:11.553 --> 25:14.693
people gravitated to that kind of leadership.

25:14.789 --> 25:16.462
Look...

25:17.792 --> 25:22.969
One of the most important elements of
guerrilla warfare is to maintain secrecy.

25:23.064 --> 25:27.570
I've killed nobody until, you know,
it's been proven.

25:28.236 --> 25:30.147
And they'll never be able
to prove anything like that.

25:31.973 --> 25:34.954
Most people I knew
thought George Jackson was a hero.

25:35.343 --> 25:39.621
The fact that he may have also been
a criminal was glossed over.

25:41.549 --> 25:44.291
I first saw him

25:45.286 --> 25:46.629
at a hearing.

25:46.688 --> 25:48.531
We may have mouthed some words,

25:48.590 --> 25:53.471
but it was, of course, illegal to
communicate with prisoners in the court.

25:55.063 --> 26:00.069
I was, you know, drawn by
a kind of tenderness

26:00.134 --> 26:04.276
that I did not expect to find in prisoners.

26:06.441 --> 26:11.288
He was a beautiful writer,
a powerful writer, passionate writer.

26:11.746 --> 26:16.752
And I eventually felt very much
seduced by that.

26:27.428 --> 26:29.499
Brother George Jackson,
one of the Soledad Brothers,

26:29.564 --> 26:33.068
has been in prison for 10 years

26:33.134 --> 26:36.980
since he was 18 years old
on a second degree robbery charge.

26:38.439 --> 26:41.249
One of the things that we really have
to talk about and come to grips with

26:41.309 --> 26:43.482
is this whole question of crime.

26:43.745 --> 26:47.750
What does it mean to be
a criminal in this society?

26:51.352 --> 26:54.595
George had a younger brother, Jonathan,

26:54.789 --> 26:59.499
who was about 16, I think,
when I first met him.

26:59.661 --> 27:04.269
He was an incredible writer,
and wrote for his school newspaper,

27:04.332 --> 27:08.906
and wrote articles about his brother
and the Soledad Brothers' case.

27:08.970 --> 27:10.916
I think he was totally devastated

27:10.972 --> 27:15.352
that his brother had been
behind bars for 10 years.

27:26.387 --> 27:29.459
I came to realize that
the Soledad Brothers Defense Committee

27:29.524 --> 27:31.060
was really a lifeline for him.

27:31.159 --> 27:33.799
He needed to have some hope

27:33.861 --> 27:39.004
that the person he most identified
with in life

27:39.067 --> 27:41.479
was one day going to be free.

28:36.357 --> 28:39.236
In San Rafael, California,
north of San Francisco,

28:39.327 --> 28:41.864
a judge and three other persons
were shot to death today

28:41.963 --> 28:44.671
in an attempt
by a group of convicts to escape.

28:47.802 --> 28:51.045
Judge Harold Haley was hearing the case
of a San Quentin inmate

28:51.139 --> 28:54.313
when an unidentified man armed
with dynamite and an automatic weapon

28:54.375 --> 28:55.683
entered the courtroom.

28:55.843 --> 28:59.052
The defendant, along with
two other inmates testifying for him,

28:59.180 --> 29:01.285
reportedly joined with the unidentified man

29:01.349 --> 29:05.263
in rounding up the judge, a deputy
district attorney and three women jurors.

29:06.654 --> 29:08.565
When it was over, Judge Haley was dead,

29:08.689 --> 29:11.761
the deputy district attorney
had been critically wounded in the back,

29:11.859 --> 29:13.998
one woman juror was wounded in the arm,

29:14.195 --> 29:17.142
two of the inmates were dead,
as was the unidentified man.

29:20.968 --> 29:26.111
I could not deal with the fact that
this young man,

29:26.240 --> 29:28.811
who was 17 at the time,

29:29.010 --> 29:35.359
that he ends up lying on the cold cement
in a parking lot

29:35.483 --> 29:39.727
in one of the most wealthy counties
in the country.

29:54.135 --> 29:59.050
The funeral for Superior Judge
Harold Haley was a major civic event.

29:59.140 --> 30:03.213
The cortege escorted by a detail of
60 police officers

30:03.277 --> 30:06.224
from cities all over the San Francisco Bay.

30:07.448 --> 30:10.554
Judge Haley, after all, was a prominent man.

30:10.618 --> 30:14.498
And his death deeply shocked
and angered his peers.

30:14.555 --> 30:17.365
His kidnappers,
they described as hoodlums,

30:17.425 --> 30:19.837
who called themselves revolutionaries.

30:23.464 --> 30:28.004
Across the Bay in Oakland, there was
another funeral for Jonathan Jackson,

30:28.402 --> 30:33.147
the young Panther who was supposed to
have staged the bloody kidnap attempt.

30:34.275 --> 30:37.688
I, and my husband,
we went to Jonathan's funeral.

30:38.512 --> 30:41.925
Everybody in their Sunday best,
many people weeping.

30:42.917 --> 30:46.990
When they brought the casket out,
and Mrs. Jackson followed,

30:47.255 --> 30:51.135
people holding her up
and a handkerchief to her face.

30:53.027 --> 30:56.474
And it said to me, what he had done
represented something.

30:56.998 --> 30:59.341
'Cause that was thousands
and thousands of people

30:59.342 --> 31:00.242
out there in the street.

31:00.334 --> 31:03.611
Nobody organized that. People just came.

31:07.742 --> 31:12.418
While we were standing there,
Franklin comes up, Franklin Alexander.

31:12.647 --> 31:15.992
We were standing in such a way
that he was next to us,

31:16.050 --> 31:18.724
but looking straight,
as though he wasn't talking to us.

31:18.886 --> 31:23.733
And he said, "Angela's been implicated."
And he said, "She's gone underground."

31:24.125 --> 31:26.298
And he said, "I'm just, you know,
letting you know. Okay?"

31:26.460 --> 31:29.669
We said, "Okay. "
And then he disappeared into the crowd.

31:33.768 --> 31:37.306
Today, it turned out that two of the guns
used in the courtroom

31:37.371 --> 31:40.409
were bought some time ago
by Angela Davis.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.444
It was clear

31:42.510 --> 31:49.394
that that was not the time to make
myself available to the police for arrest.

32:01.495 --> 32:04.374
Mr. Alexander, you say that
you are the chairman

32:04.432 --> 32:07.174
of the Che Lumumba Club
of the Communist Party?

32:07.234 --> 32:10.306
Miss Davis has identified herself
as a member of that group.

32:10.371 --> 32:11.714
She is a member of that group.

32:11.772 --> 32:14.719
Is it the doctrine of that club

32:14.775 --> 32:17.984
to use guns for black liberation?

32:18.079 --> 32:21.322
It is the doctrine of the Communist Party

32:21.482 --> 32:24.656
that black people, that all people

32:24.752 --> 32:28.097
have the right to defend themselves
and their homes.

32:28.489 --> 32:30.230
When asked by a reporter,

32:30.291 --> 32:33.636
"What would you tell Angela Davis
if you could speak with her today?",

32:33.694 --> 32:37.107
he smiled and said simply,
"I love you, baby."

32:37.365 --> 32:39.936
"You wouldn't tell her to give herself up,"
he was asked.

32:40.001 --> 32:44.211
And he repeated, "I would tell her,
'I love you, baby.' Nothing more."

32:51.278 --> 32:54.225
The FBI has put black militant Angela Davis

32:54.281 --> 32:56.386
on its list of the 10 most wanted fugitives.

32:56.584 --> 32:58.655
She's charged with murder in California,

32:58.753 --> 33:00.592
where authorities say
she bought weapons

33:00.593 --> 33:02.793
for that San Rafael courtroom shootout.

33:05.393 --> 33:07.236
Hoover put her on the top 10.

33:07.728 --> 33:10.868
The key to the top 10,
she was a communist.

33:11.465 --> 33:13.467
They were not his favorite people.

33:14.235 --> 33:15.942
And if you were on the top 10,

33:16.871 --> 33:18.544
you're gonna get a lot of attention.

33:21.075 --> 33:25.820
We were devastated, you know.
In our gut, we had to know

33:25.880 --> 33:27.655
there was something wrong here,

33:27.715 --> 33:33.188
that this could not possibly be anything
Angela would be involved in.

33:33.654 --> 33:35.327
Not the Angela we knew.

33:35.523 --> 33:36.695
It couldn't be her.

33:41.195 --> 33:46.577
Anyone involved in planning a violent
operation like Jonathan Jackson's,

33:46.634 --> 33:48.238
that was on a need-to-know basis.

33:48.302 --> 33:49.975
So, only certain people would know.

33:51.105 --> 33:54.575
You would think that somebody
with an advanced degree,

33:54.708 --> 33:56.881
particularly someone
who had a public profile,

33:56.944 --> 33:58.550
would be the last person

33:58.551 --> 34:01.451
who would want to use
those weapons in an illegal act.

34:02.850 --> 34:07.321
On a truly common sense perspective,
it doesn't make sense.

34:09.489 --> 34:10.935
But on the other hand,

34:13.027 --> 34:14.597
crazy shit happens.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.301
What is the evidence?

34:20.101 --> 34:24.344
The evidence is
that Angela Davis purchased four guns.

34:24.572 --> 34:26.313
There was a provision in the penal code

34:26.373 --> 34:30.822
that anybody in this state could buy as
many guns as he or she wanted to buy.

34:31.679 --> 34:33.420
And that's the law of the state of California.

34:34.348 --> 34:36.793
And because Governor Reagan
wanted it that way,

34:38.219 --> 34:40.199
Angela Davis bought four guns.

34:44.625 --> 34:45.933
And why did she buy them?

34:47.194 --> 34:48.900
I don't know and you don't know.

34:49.597 --> 34:51.770
But it is reasonable to suppose

34:52.032 --> 34:55.138
that anybody who teaches
at this institution and who speaks up

34:57.238 --> 34:58.774
for power to the people,

34:59.006 --> 35:01.384
who speaks up for
the freedom of political prisoners,

35:01.442 --> 35:04.616
who speaks out on any issue
receives every week...

35:04.678 --> 35:07.454
I receive every week, letters,

35:07.515 --> 35:11.361
and the theme and tone
of those letters ranges from

35:11.752 --> 35:15.199
violent and vicious imprecations
to outright threats of death.

35:16.524 --> 35:17.969
And for Angela Davis,

35:18.492 --> 35:20.472
whose prominence as a black woman

35:20.861 --> 35:25.037
and a communist, that mail came every day.

35:26.133 --> 35:27.976
And there were threats on her life.

35:28.736 --> 35:30.545
And she bought four guns.

35:36.043 --> 35:38.922
The FBI and the police descended
on the black communities

35:38.979 --> 35:41.323
all over the country and began pulling in

35:41.448 --> 35:44.520
any young, tall, black woman
with a space between her teeth.

35:44.919 --> 35:46.830
'Cause they just had
this general description.

35:50.491 --> 35:52.266
We had her fingerprints and a photograph

35:52.660 --> 35:54.503
of a girl with a big afro.

35:54.962 --> 35:58.671
And every office gets
a box full of those things.

36:01.302 --> 36:04.215
There were unmarked cars
parked across the street.

36:04.305 --> 36:08.481
I knew then, this was the FBI
and that we were under surveillance.

36:08.709 --> 36:10.000
So many hundreds
of black women with big afros

36:10.000 --> 36:11.212
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
So many hundreds
of black women with big afros

36:11.212 --> 36:11.278
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:11.278 --> 36:13.258
were stopped on suspicion
of being Angela Davis.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:13.258 --> 36:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:32.833 --> 36:37.248
I decided that I did not
want to flee the country.

36:37.705 --> 36:43.121
Because, certainly,
if I had decided to travel to Cuba

36:43.244 --> 36:45.554
or some other country
that would have given me asylum,

36:45.613 --> 36:49.288
and I probably could have gotten asylum
from any number of countries,

36:49.650 --> 36:51.459
I would have been there
for the rest of my life.

36:59.860 --> 37:02.340
I flew from Las Vegas to Chicago,

37:02.396 --> 37:05.866
where I managed to hook up
with David Poindexter.

37:06.267 --> 37:11.046
David was the person
who helped me for the remaining period.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.878
The search for Angela Davis

37:15.042 --> 37:18.717
has spread from Los Angeles,
through the Bay Area, through Canada,

37:18.779 --> 37:21.885
to a series of raids
in her hometown of Birmingham

37:22.082 --> 37:25.256
after a US district court judge
issued the fugitive warrants

37:25.319 --> 37:27.890
and set bail at $100,000.

37:31.525 --> 37:33.630
The attitude in the Bureau was,

37:34.061 --> 37:36.803
the only way you're gonna solve
anything is to have an informant.

37:40.200 --> 37:43.943
And we used to think most of
the Communist Party members are FBI.

37:44.371 --> 37:48.046
It was thoroughly, thoroughly infiltrated.

37:49.276 --> 37:51.654
A file was opened up in every office.

37:51.912 --> 37:53.755
Everybody had a file on her.

38:25.245 --> 38:27.156
I stayed at David's apartment,

38:27.214 --> 38:30.218
and then had to leave
because he had gotten into

38:30.284 --> 38:32.958
an argument with one of his friends
who lived in the building.

38:33.020 --> 38:36.331
And we were afraid
that this person might reveal

38:36.390 --> 38:39.997
that I was with him
if the FBI ever questioned him.

38:41.562 --> 38:43.371
So we traveled to Miami,

38:43.430 --> 38:48.743
and I was holed up in Miami for
what seemed like an eternity.

39:00.848 --> 39:02.350
I was pretty scared.

39:03.350 --> 39:08.424
At any moment, I felt
I was on the verge of being caught.

39:09.123 --> 39:12.161
I had this fear with me all the time.

39:16.897 --> 39:21.471
I thought a lot about
the people I had left behind,

39:21.535 --> 39:24.880
my family, of course.
I worried about my mother.

39:25.139 --> 39:27.119
I worried about my siblings,

39:27.174 --> 39:29.848
I worried about my friends, my comrades.

39:31.111 --> 39:34.024
And every strange noise I heard

39:34.081 --> 39:36.459
I interpreted as, "The cops are coming.

39:36.950 --> 39:39.954
"The FBI is knocking on the door."

39:46.193 --> 39:49.538
And then the Alexander girl's name
comes into it, and they talked to her.

39:52.266 --> 39:55.645
She wasn't helpful,
but nor was she antagonistic.

39:57.237 --> 39:59.979
It was determined
that she had been in Chicago

40:00.040 --> 40:02.042
with David Poindexter.

40:02.443 --> 40:06.289
And there is some stuff
in there about David's woman,

40:06.346 --> 40:07.347
she was jealous.

40:07.548 --> 40:09.824
And she told us some things, that they were

40:10.617 --> 40:13.393
there and they headed to Florida.

40:18.158 --> 40:21.503
Once we identified the car,
and Chicago did that,

40:21.628 --> 40:23.301
now we knew what we were looking for.

40:25.499 --> 40:27.672
Sooner or later, we're gonna find that car.

40:29.102 --> 40:31.946
And they located one place
where the guy thought

40:32.039 --> 40:33.848
that they might have been here.

40:33.907 --> 40:35.614
But the girl didn't look like her.

40:37.644 --> 40:41.148
They questioned his mother
who lived in Florida,

40:41.315 --> 40:42.885
which meant we had to leave Florida.

40:48.789 --> 40:50.791
They had vacated the apartment,

40:51.124 --> 40:54.435
and the agents went in there
and they looked all around.

40:56.563 --> 41:00.568
And in the cushions of the couch,

41:01.001 --> 41:05.074
they found an exposed roll of 35mm film,

41:05.138 --> 41:07.584
which becomes a big thing in this case.

41:10.010 --> 41:12.320
Now, they were all pictures of Angela,

41:13.113 --> 41:14.615
but she doesn't have an afro.

41:14.715 --> 41:16.285
She's got a little pixie cut.

41:21.388 --> 41:23.561
They had vacated the apartment,

41:23.624 --> 41:25.604
and they were traveling north.

41:25.792 --> 41:29.399
The best place to hide in this world
is right over there,

41:29.496 --> 41:30.668
New York City.

41:34.868 --> 41:38.145
We were actually, very rapidly,
running out of money.

41:39.139 --> 41:41.278
So we were staying at the Howard Johnson,

41:41.341 --> 41:44.151
because that was the only thing
we could afford.

41:45.178 --> 41:49.627
And I actually had a palpable sense
of the FBI closing in.

41:57.658 --> 42:02.437
So we, in New York, started
a detailed search of everything.

42:02.696 --> 42:05.404
We did LaGuardia and JFK

42:05.566 --> 42:09.036
and all the commercial
parking lots in Manhattan.

42:09.636 --> 42:13.778
Lo and behold, we got a call one morning
and they said, "We found the car. "

42:13.974 --> 42:16.750
"Come on. Stop this nonsense now."

42:16.977 --> 42:21.016
"No, it's in the Howard Johnson's
parking lot."

42:23.116 --> 42:24.789
We head out for Howard Johnson's,

42:24.851 --> 42:28.196
we talked to the guy behind the counter
and we showed him the picture.

42:28.255 --> 42:30.826
He said, "Yeah, I checked them in. "

42:31.191 --> 42:32.898
This is like something
Hollywood would write.

42:34.261 --> 42:35.740
Everything was falling into place.

42:41.168 --> 42:44.377
A couple of minutes later,
we hear the elevator door open.

42:44.638 --> 42:47.084
And you could hear them
walking down the hallway.

42:48.175 --> 42:50.712
I handcuffed her
before she even turned around.

42:51.945 --> 42:54.425
She didn't react to it at all.

42:55.882 --> 42:57.589
She was a little

42:58.852 --> 43:02.265
taken back when I said,
"I got to lift your upper lip."

43:06.693 --> 43:08.536
And I said, "I'm looking for that gap."

43:10.731 --> 43:13.177
They snatched the wig off of my head.

43:14.001 --> 43:15.708
They kept repeating, over and over again,

43:15.769 --> 43:18.477
"Are you Angela Davis?
Are you Angela Davis?"

43:20.340 --> 43:22.650
I did not say, "Yes, " I did not say, "No, "

43:22.943 --> 43:24.581
I didn't say anything at all.

43:25.779 --> 43:28.089
I only requested my telephone calls.

43:31.385 --> 43:33.561
Black revolutionary,
Angela Davis,

43:33.562 --> 43:36.062
appeared without her
distinctive afro hairdo,

43:36.123 --> 43:39.798
as she was arraigned in New York City
today as a fugitive from justice.

43:47.968 --> 43:50.812
Secretary General, Secretary Kennedy
and ladies and gentlemen,

43:51.972 --> 43:55.476
the purpose of my coming
to the Department of Justice today

43:56.610 --> 43:59.113
in this great hall, is to sign
the Organized Crime Bill.

43:59.546 --> 44:04.222
I think that the actions of the FBI
in apprehending Angela Davis,

44:04.584 --> 44:08.157
a rather remarkable story again

44:08.221 --> 44:12.670
in the long history of remarkable stories
of apprehensions by the FBI,

44:12.959 --> 44:15.997
is an indication that once
the federal government,

44:16.063 --> 44:18.771
through the FBI, moves into an area,

44:18.832 --> 44:21.278
we shall see to it that those

44:21.334 --> 44:24.474
who engage in such terroristic acts
are brought to justice.

44:26.707 --> 44:28.948
Free Angela Davis!
No extradition!

44:29.076 --> 44:32.853
Free Angela Davis!
No extradition!

44:32.913 --> 44:34.449
Free Angela Davis!

44:35.048 --> 44:36.391
And therefore, the whole question...

44:36.483 --> 44:39.589
People say, "Why didn't
Angela Davis give herself up?"

44:39.653 --> 44:42.862
The question of getting a fair trial
is a real difficult and serious

44:42.923 --> 44:44.300
problem for black Americans.

44:44.624 --> 44:47.434
And therefore, I think she has
certainly the right to try and pick

44:47.494 --> 44:50.805
the moment when
she can get closest to a fair trial.

44:51.665 --> 44:54.373
The most important point
that should be remembered

44:54.434 --> 44:58.849
is that Angela Davis
has been publicly indicted by the FBI.

44:58.905 --> 45:01.351
She's been put on the 10 Most Wanted list.

45:01.408 --> 45:04.981
Her picture has been
placed in all post offices,

45:05.178 --> 45:08.591
and this has given a license to racists...

45:08.715 --> 45:12.959
Ma'am, when she knew she was wanted,
why didn't she turn herself in?

45:15.055 --> 45:19.367
Well, I don't know. Would you turn
yourself over to a pack of wolves?

45:25.232 --> 45:27.371
I went to New York almost immediately.

45:27.434 --> 45:31.007
She was arrested on October 13th,
and I think I flew out the next day.

45:31.905 --> 45:33.907
She was in the Women's
House of Detention.

45:35.442 --> 45:39.254
She was exhausted and gaunt and very pale.

45:40.180 --> 45:42.353
But she was already focused on her defense

45:42.482 --> 45:43.927
and on what needed to be done.

45:46.753 --> 45:48.892
I was in solitary confinement

45:48.955 --> 45:54.564
after they had placed me in the ward
for people with psychological disorders.

45:55.729 --> 45:57.709
I had been doing all of this work on prisons,

45:57.764 --> 46:01.268
I had been doing all this work
to free political prisoners,

46:01.334 --> 46:06.977
but I hadn't really thought about what
it meant to be a woman behind bars.

46:11.711 --> 46:13.713
Fania, when did you last see your sister?

46:14.014 --> 46:18.554
I saw her last night at around 8:00 or 9:00.

46:18.852 --> 46:22.265
You had a pretty bourgeois
and comfortable childhood,

46:22.322 --> 46:23.960
and so did she, in Birmingham.

46:24.591 --> 46:28.539
Can you trace the development
of someone from that kind of background

46:28.762 --> 46:31.504
into a revolutionary and Marxist person?

46:31.865 --> 46:35.244
I see in her life
the makings of a revolutionary.

46:36.336 --> 46:39.249
I don't see in her life the makings
of a personal tragedy,

46:40.273 --> 46:41.980
of a good girl gone wrong.

46:42.876 --> 46:44.480
Her life in the South,

46:44.644 --> 46:47.022
her experience with
white people in the North,

46:47.447 --> 46:50.724
all that to me would go into the makings
of what she is now.

46:50.784 --> 46:52.354
And that is a revolutionary.

46:52.452 --> 46:56.696
And Angela's education
is now being put into practice.

46:58.458 --> 47:01.837
And that's a raison d'etre for her education.

47:11.004 --> 47:12.540
We challenged extradition.

47:12.939 --> 47:15.545
We took this all the way up
to the US Supreme Court.

47:19.346 --> 47:23.226
And so, when at about 2:00
or 3:00 in the morning,

47:23.316 --> 47:27.890
guards came to my cell
informing me that my attorney

47:27.954 --> 47:32.369
wanted to speak to me about extradition,
it made sense.

47:33.226 --> 47:35.001
But they had other plans.

47:38.798 --> 47:40.471
I ended up being pushed down on the floor,

47:40.533 --> 47:43.707
they got my hands handcuffed
behind my back.

47:44.337 --> 47:47.978
And then took me outside
and placed me in a car.

47:49.209 --> 47:51.314
I kept asking, "Where are we going?"

47:51.378 --> 47:53.358
No one would say anything.

47:54.214 --> 47:55.852
And this long caravan

47:55.982 --> 47:58.087
began to drive through
the streets of New York.

48:20.573 --> 48:24.851
I was totally shocked to discover,
in the middle of the night,

48:24.978 --> 48:29.427
this National Guard plane
surrounded by soldiers.

48:31.151 --> 48:32.994
And I remember saying to myself

48:33.153 --> 48:35.224
"I had better be very careful,

48:35.388 --> 48:37.766
"because if I so much as stumble,

48:37.991 --> 48:43.031
"they will probably open fire on me
and that will be the end."

48:49.035 --> 48:52.073
Angela Davis was arraigned
in the same San Rafael civic center

48:52.138 --> 48:54.414
where last summer
a district judge was killed

48:54.474 --> 48:56.283
in an aborted kidnap attempt.

48:56.810 --> 48:58.983
Security precautions were extraordinary.

48:59.079 --> 49:01.286
Each spectator carefully
searched for weapons.

49:01.581 --> 49:04.892
There has been one bomb explosion
and innumerable bomb scares

49:05.018 --> 49:07.020
here in the months since
the judge's murder.

49:07.454 --> 49:09.127
Miss Davis entered the courtroom,

49:09.322 --> 49:11.666
turned and gave
a Black Power salute to the gallery

49:11.825 --> 49:14.328
composed mostly of newsmen,
and sat down

49:14.394 --> 49:16.601
next to her two temporary lawyers.

49:16.963 --> 49:18.271
Judge E. Warren McGuire

49:18.331 --> 49:20.504
ordered a copy of the charge
delivered to her

49:20.633 --> 49:23.637
and advised her of her rights
to an attorney and to a jury trial.

49:25.305 --> 49:29.879
When the Attorney General arraigned me
in California after the extradition,

49:29.943 --> 49:32.787
he indicated that he wanted
the death penalty

49:32.846 --> 49:34.291
on each of the three charges.

49:34.414 --> 49:37.486
So he wanted the death penalty three times.

49:38.918 --> 49:42.229
That made me realize how serious they were.

49:42.789 --> 49:46.134
And again, it made me realize
that it wasn't about me

49:46.860 --> 49:49.841
because, first of all,
I couldn't be killed three times.

49:50.530 --> 49:54.808
It was about the construction
of this imaginary enemy,

49:55.335 --> 49:59.545
and I was the embodiment of that enemy.

50:01.674 --> 50:03.847
- Angela must be free!
- Now!

50:03.910 --> 50:05.218
- Angela must be free!
- Now!

50:05.278 --> 50:07.815
We had a nice long visit with Angela.

50:08.248 --> 50:12.025
And she's in very high spirits.
She's feeling good.

50:12.452 --> 50:13.453
Right on.

50:13.653 --> 50:15.496
She's feeling good because she knows

50:16.456 --> 50:19.960
that the movement to free all
political prisoners is growing every day.

50:20.593 --> 50:22.334
That's what makes her feel good.

50:22.395 --> 50:26.969
As long as we have people
like you fighting to free Angela,

50:27.033 --> 50:28.944
-he'll be free. All power to the people.
- Right on.

50:29.002 --> 50:30.003
Right on!

50:30.870 --> 50:32.372
Free Angela!

50:32.439 --> 50:34.578
Free Angela! Free Angela!

50:34.974 --> 50:37.045
Free Angela! Free Angela!

50:37.210 --> 50:39.053
Free Angela! Free Angela!

50:41.381 --> 50:43.122
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

50:43.183 --> 50:44.856
- For who?
- Angela!

50:44.918 --> 50:46.420
- When?
- Now!

50:46.486 --> 50:48.124
We know that she is innocent,

50:48.221 --> 50:51.862
and the entire family,
along with many other people,

50:51.925 --> 50:54.735
will be fighting for her freedom.

51:05.038 --> 51:07.882
We're not just sitting by letting this happen.

51:08.208 --> 51:11.519
We'd already formed
a defense committee for Angela.

51:13.546 --> 51:17.050
We called ourselves, "The National
United Committee to Free Angela Davis

51:17.117 --> 51:18.460
"and All Political Prisoners."

51:18.518 --> 51:21.055
She insisted on "All Political Prisoners."

51:22.489 --> 51:24.560
Free Angela and All Political Prisoners.

51:24.924 --> 51:27.530
We had connections and people
in the Trade Union Movement

51:27.594 --> 51:30.165
and the churches, we were able to go

51:30.463 --> 51:33.000
and say, "Will you support a resolution

51:33.333 --> 51:35.540
"for Angela Davis to be released on bail?"

51:36.202 --> 51:37.545
And they might say yes or no,

51:37.604 --> 51:41.313
but they'd say,
"Persuade us. Come in and talk to us."

51:42.442 --> 51:43.921
It was actually Henry Winston,

51:43.977 --> 51:45.786
who was National Chairman
of the Communist Party,

51:45.945 --> 51:47.686
he said, "Campaign for bail. "

51:47.814 --> 51:49.657
I went like, looking at him,
"What, are you nuts?

51:49.716 --> 51:51.059
"No way we campaign for bail."

51:51.117 --> 51:53.358
The President of the United States
made a public statement

51:53.419 --> 51:55.160
in which he congratulates
the FBI on the capture

51:55.221 --> 51:57.394
of the "dangerous terrorist,"
Angela Davis.

51:57.457 --> 51:59.130
That's a quote. "Dangerous terrorist."

51:59.192 --> 52:00.432
He was saying, "Campaign for bail."

52:00.493 --> 52:02.370
We'd say, "Campaign for bail?"

52:02.428 --> 52:04.840
President of the United States...
He says, "Campaign for bail."

52:05.064 --> 52:07.135
That man was a genius.
He was a tactical genius,

52:07.200 --> 52:10.738
because people would sign petitions for bail

52:10.803 --> 52:12.248
who may have thought she was guilty,

52:12.305 --> 52:15.616
but believed that she
was entitled to a fair trial.

52:16.442 --> 52:19.753
Charlene Mitchell, who was the brain
behind the whole

52:21.381 --> 52:23.725
National United Committee
to Free Angela Davis.

52:23.883 --> 52:27.763
I didn't know the first thing about
organizing movements, but Charlene did.

52:28.788 --> 52:31.166
All of our efforts and all of our energies

52:31.658 --> 52:35.105
had to be focused
on getting her out of there.

52:36.863 --> 52:39.366
Politically, I saw this case as a bellwether.

52:39.966 --> 52:41.639
They are not going to kill her.

52:42.202 --> 52:44.182
They're not going to imprison her,
we're going to free her.

52:44.237 --> 52:45.875
We're gonna win her freedom.

53:02.055 --> 53:04.467
I was in solitary confinement,

53:04.991 --> 53:07.733
some distance from where

53:08.328 --> 53:10.706
the majority of women were kept.

53:14.100 --> 53:16.546
It was lonely, very lonely.

53:19.138 --> 53:21.584
I read a lot. I wrote a lot.

53:22.842 --> 53:27.848
I followed the examples
of other prisoners, such as George.

53:29.282 --> 53:31.990
I was able to create

53:32.885 --> 53:36.833
a certain sphere of freedom, you might say,

53:37.090 --> 53:40.731
within the context of that confinement.

53:42.395 --> 53:45.035
Well, I suppose as far as you're concerned,

53:45.164 --> 53:47.872
it's no surprise
that you're in solitary confinement.

53:47.934 --> 53:51.609
And I'm wondering what kind of
shock that has been to your sensibilities,

53:51.671 --> 53:52.945
to your emotions?

53:53.006 --> 53:55.213
But see, I understood

53:56.209 --> 53:59.122
very well that the reason why

53:59.445 --> 54:01.447
the Marin County officials

54:01.781 --> 54:05.490
would not permit me to talk
to any other woman in that jail

54:05.685 --> 54:07.358
was because they wanted to break me.

54:07.620 --> 54:09.759
They wanted me to respond in that way.

54:09.989 --> 54:14.404
They wanted me to feel
the burden of the solitude,

54:15.328 --> 54:17.899
and I just had to make up my mind

54:17.964 --> 54:20.968
that I was not going to
let it affect me that way.

54:21.734 --> 54:25.807
I think that what George Jackson said about

54:27.106 --> 54:29.382
life in prison is very appropriate here.

54:29.475 --> 54:36.222
He says that prison either breaks
a person or makes the person stronger.

54:37.250 --> 54:39.753
And I would like to think

54:39.819 --> 54:45.030
that I have become stronger
during this experience.

54:47.927 --> 54:50.908
My emotional relationship with George

54:50.963 --> 54:54.172
became far more intense
when I was behind bars.

54:55.668 --> 54:57.545
Part of that passion

54:58.905 --> 55:00.509
consisted in

55:00.840 --> 55:06.119
our being able to imagine ourselves
as comrades

55:07.246 --> 55:10.227
helping to usher in a new world.

55:10.817 --> 55:12.319
When she was in prison

55:12.719 --> 55:15.791
and when George was in prison,
they had the opportunity to meet.

55:16.422 --> 55:19.164
We met for a period of time,
we had discussions

55:19.225 --> 55:22.798
and the type of things that you discuss
when you have a legal meeting.

55:23.162 --> 55:26.405
And then Angela and George had met

55:26.499 --> 55:28.501
separately to discuss things

55:28.568 --> 55:31.242
that only the two of them wanted
to discuss with each other.

55:33.973 --> 55:36.214
It was a meeting that was

55:36.409 --> 55:40.118
really complicated and full of
all kinds of emotions and feelings.

55:44.617 --> 55:46.119
She's been locked up.

55:46.185 --> 55:49.689
And if she's had the opportunity
to do some hugging and kissing, right on.

55:50.690 --> 55:53.261
That's my theory.

56:35.768 --> 56:38.510
Those were the years
of the black revolution.

56:38.738 --> 56:41.184
Everybody wanted to organize.

56:41.274 --> 56:46.087
And your organization,
the first thing of it was, it was black.

56:46.145 --> 56:48.887
Black teachers, black doctors,
black lawyers.

56:48.948 --> 56:51.258
Black people who were professionals.

56:51.451 --> 56:54.557
Black people who had done
everything that the system says,

56:54.854 --> 56:57.027
they were, now.

56:58.090 --> 57:00.161
I thought it was important strategically

57:00.226 --> 57:04.231
for a black attorney to be the public face

57:04.297 --> 57:06.641
of a political prisoner at trial.

57:07.700 --> 57:09.577
We wanted to present to the world

57:09.635 --> 57:11.672
the picture of African-American lawyers

57:11.737 --> 57:15.207
performing at a very high level
on a worldwide stage.

57:15.708 --> 57:19.019
And you have to understand the workings
of a racist judicial system,

57:19.645 --> 57:22.558
that the system
is in control of the white people.

57:23.449 --> 57:27.158
And white people don't take any risks
when it comes to black people.

57:27.720 --> 57:30.428
So, I don't think that
you're gonna find a jury

57:30.857 --> 57:33.736
who's going to have the courage
to do what's demanded of them.

57:38.397 --> 57:41.003
I don't know of any other
cases in the last century

57:41.300 --> 57:43.746
that presented that degree of difficulty.

57:43.803 --> 57:46.477
Where the courthouse
itself was a crime scene,

57:46.839 --> 57:51.549
and the judge, the prosecutor,
the jurors and witnesses were all victims.

57:59.852 --> 58:02.264
A big issue at the beginning of the case
was whether or not

58:02.321 --> 58:04.995
to sever the trials
of Angela Davis and Ruchell Magee.

58:06.125 --> 58:08.503
So he is the surviving
prisoner from August 7th.

58:08.728 --> 58:10.401
And he was being charged
with the same thing.

58:10.463 --> 58:11.601
First degree murder,

58:11.602 --> 58:14.002
first degree kidnapping
and conspiracy to commit both.

58:15.234 --> 58:19.546
There were those who wanted me
to be disassociated with Ruchell

58:19.972 --> 58:22.350
and felt that that was the best way

58:23.142 --> 58:25.383
to assert my innocence.

58:27.146 --> 58:29.922
I didn't want to disassociate myself.

58:30.349 --> 58:33.023
Ruchell argued it was like a slave rebellion.

58:33.119 --> 58:34.860
In a lot of ways, it probably was.

58:34.921 --> 58:37.800
It was, kind of this last ditch effort,

58:37.857 --> 58:42.636
some way to assert
some control over one's life.

58:44.196 --> 58:47.473
We had a big debate because we said,
"Look, Angela wasn't even there.

58:47.533 --> 58:50.980
"It's very prejudicial to her
to have him tried together with her.

58:51.070 --> 58:52.674
"She never even met the man. "

58:53.172 --> 58:55.652
On the other hand,
we didn't want to abandon Ruchell.

58:56.742 --> 59:00.349
Miss Davis' attorneys asked the judge
to set her free on bail.

59:00.413 --> 59:04.259
But Magee objected,
saying it would prejudice his own case.

59:04.517 --> 59:06.596
Apparently, defendants Davis and Magee

59:06.597 --> 59:09.297
are at odds on each other's
defense tactics.

59:09.355 --> 59:10.629
The court denied bail,

59:10.690 --> 59:13.136
so both defendants
were sent back to their cells

59:13.192 --> 59:15.194
until a new judge is appointed.

59:15.361 --> 59:16.840
That could take several weeks.

59:23.069 --> 59:25.675
None of the judges in Marin County
were qualified,

59:25.738 --> 59:28.981
because Judge Haley was their colleague.

59:29.208 --> 59:32.849
So, the judicial council
then had to select a judge

59:33.479 --> 59:34.924
to try the case.

59:35.448 --> 59:39.624
Will you ever find a judge who can give
you a fair trial in your estimation?

59:39.885 --> 59:41.956
Well, we certainly
have got to search for one.

59:42.121 --> 59:44.692
We are sort of like Diogenes,
looking for the honest man.

59:44.757 --> 59:46.634
We're looking for an honest judge.

59:47.660 --> 59:50.641
The next judge who was assigned
was Judge Richard Arnason

59:50.696 --> 59:52.573
from Contra Costa County.

59:52.798 --> 59:54.607
And the first day he was on the bench,

59:54.667 --> 59:58.979
we reached the conclusion that this is
the judge that should have this case.

59:59.538 --> 01:00:02.485
'Cause he had an air about him

01:00:02.775 --> 01:00:06.484
that he would be fair,
he would make an effort to be fair,

01:00:06.545 --> 01:00:08.286
and that he would be in charge.

01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:11.060
I think that, perhaps,

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:15.159
it would be much better to ask
somebody who has seen me

01:00:15.421 --> 01:00:19.233
in the years I've been on the bench,
what kind of a judge I am.

01:00:19.959 --> 01:00:23.236
Self-analysis has never been
very productive for anybody,

01:00:23.295 --> 01:00:25.297
and I'm not going to do it now at this time.

01:00:30.202 --> 01:00:33.081
Defense attorneys today asked
that the murder and kidnap indictments

01:00:33.172 --> 01:00:35.152
against Angela Davis be dismissed.

01:00:35.207 --> 01:00:38.347
"Because she's completely
innocent of these charges

01:00:38.411 --> 01:00:42.382
"and she's locked into a proceeding
that never gets started."

01:00:42.982 --> 01:00:46.156
The judge, the sixth
to hear the pre-trial motions,

01:00:46.419 --> 01:00:48.126
had already been charged with prejudice

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.757
by Miss Davis' co-defendant Ruchell Magee.

01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:53.798
The judge said he would proceed
no further with the case

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:56.999
until the prejudice challenge
was ruled on by another judge.

01:01:02.668 --> 01:01:07.117
Finally, I realized that
the case needed to be tried.

01:01:07.173 --> 01:01:08.811
It needed to be tried soon.

01:01:09.308 --> 01:01:12.380
And that was because
the organizing was at its peak.

01:01:12.478 --> 01:01:16.051
And if we got involved
in all of these other motions

01:01:16.282 --> 01:01:18.262
and motion for removal...

01:01:18.484 --> 01:01:20.862
It might be five years
before the trial took place,

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.922
and I didn't want to do that.

01:01:23.656 --> 01:01:26.535
So I reluctantly

01:01:31.397 --> 01:01:32.876
decided that...

01:01:34.734 --> 01:01:37.578
Ruchell was intransigent
on this idea of removal.

01:01:46.812 --> 01:01:49.292
There were Communist Parties
everywhere in the world.

01:01:51.851 --> 01:01:54.695
And they launched campaigns,
which very quickly

01:01:54.754 --> 01:01:57.462
mushroomed into much, much larger
than themselves.

01:01:58.023 --> 01:02:00.594
There was enormous feeling
for Angela everywhere in the world.

01:02:03.863 --> 01:02:05.774
I was traveling around the world.

01:02:05.965 --> 01:02:08.775
I was in Moscow. I think I was in Leningrad.

01:02:09.135 --> 01:02:11.615
Kiev. I was in Poland.

01:02:11.971 --> 01:02:13.314
I was in Czechoslovakia

01:02:13.539 --> 01:02:15.314
and a number of different cities in Italy.

01:02:15.374 --> 01:02:17.251
West Germany and East Germany.

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:19.421
So I was on the front lines

01:02:19.478 --> 01:02:22.721
with all the people who were demanding
the freedom for Angela Davis.

01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:54.474
These millions of people around
the world would not allow my sister

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.851
to be convicted,
would not allow her to be executed.

01:03:59.678 --> 01:04:04.058
There were plays, and theater,
music being written about Angela Davis.

01:04:04.116 --> 01:04:09.361
It just created this irresistible wave,
this irresistible force.

01:04:09.722 --> 01:04:12.965
We want to tell that pharaoh in Washington

01:04:13.025 --> 01:04:15.631
to let Angela Davis go free.

01:04:19.131 --> 01:04:23.273
Nina Simone came and visited me
for a long time.

01:04:23.636 --> 01:04:26.583
She came in with a balloon,

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:31.517
which the jailers did not
want to allow me to have,

01:04:31.577 --> 01:04:33.921
but I fought for that balloon

01:04:34.046 --> 01:04:35.923
because I love Nina Simone.

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:40.188
I kept that balloon as long
as it remained inflated.

01:04:42.755 --> 01:04:48.137
Children of East Germany
wrote millions of letters to my sister.

01:04:49.828 --> 01:04:52.035
The mailman arriving every day with

01:04:52.164 --> 01:04:55.077
a huge sack of mail on his back.

01:04:55.501 --> 01:04:58.345
Just addressed to,
"Angela Davis, USA."

01:04:58.938 --> 01:05:04.251
This letter was written by a very,
very young child, apparently.

01:05:04.543 --> 01:05:06.079
And it says very simply,

01:05:06.145 --> 01:05:07.783
"Dear Angela Davis,

01:05:07.846 --> 01:05:10.622
"My name is Sarah.
I wish that you were free.

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:14.495
"This is a picture of you
when you will be free.

01:05:14.553 --> 01:05:15.861
"Love, Sarah."

01:05:15.921 --> 01:05:19.459
And on the other side,
there's a picture that she's drawn.

01:05:19.525 --> 01:05:21.630
She says it's a picture of me.

01:05:21.694 --> 01:05:23.298
You see the smile on my face.

01:05:23.362 --> 01:05:27.742
I guess that's supposed to be
symbolic of freedom.

01:05:33.472 --> 01:05:37.716
Bettina and I were in the jail
with her in Marin.

01:05:37.876 --> 01:05:40.652
The prison guards came up
and told us that we had to leave.

01:05:40.879 --> 01:05:43.951
And everything was locked down.

01:05:44.016 --> 01:05:47.395
There was no movement in the prison
at all, not on the prison ground.

01:05:48.787 --> 01:05:50.357
As I was coming home, I heard on the radio

01:05:50.422 --> 01:05:52.368
there had been an outbreak at San Quentin,

01:05:52.424 --> 01:05:55.030
and George Jackson
was believed to have escaped

01:05:55.031 --> 01:05:56.931
and had been shot in the process.

01:06:00.232 --> 01:06:06.183
And I felt that it was my responsibility
to come back and tell Angela.

01:06:07.806 --> 01:06:09.979
And then it was Margaret and Howard

01:06:10.209 --> 01:06:12.450
who had told me that he had been killed.

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:15.988
I didn't know the details.

01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:22.697
I had no idea what had happened,
except that he had been killed.

01:06:27.259 --> 01:06:32.106
He had said that he expected
that he would die in that way.

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:35.371
He expected that he would probably

01:06:35.467 --> 01:06:38.038
be killed by the state.

01:06:38.103 --> 01:06:41.050
By guards, by police.

01:06:42.775 --> 01:06:46.848
I remember the scene in the cell
when I came back.

01:06:49.515 --> 01:06:51.324
She was just totally grief stricken.

01:06:52.084 --> 01:06:53.825
And inside that grief,

01:06:54.153 --> 01:06:57.566
again, I think true for Angela,
but true for anybody,

01:06:57.623 --> 01:07:00.069
is rage, just enormous rage.

01:07:00.159 --> 01:07:03.504
Rage at the system that you couldn't stop.

01:07:04.363 --> 01:07:06.969
What should we do? What should we do?
What should we do?

01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:10.809
And George's funeral which was enormous.

01:07:12.104 --> 01:07:16.644
And then picking ourselves up
and saying, "We have to go on."

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:28.720
San Jose, California,
has changed over the last 20 years

01:07:28.787 --> 01:07:31.034
from a prosperous agricultural center

01:07:31.035 --> 01:07:33.635
to an urbanized extension
of San Francisco.

01:07:33.692 --> 01:07:37.230
Roughly 85% of the people
who live here are white.

01:07:37.296 --> 01:07:39.799
About 10% have Spanish surnames.

01:07:39.865 --> 01:07:41.708
And less than 2% are black.

01:07:41.967 --> 01:07:45.972
Over her objections,
it is the site for the trial of Angela Davis.

01:07:46.305 --> 01:07:48.854
I knew nothing about
San Jose, California,

01:07:48.855 --> 01:07:51.255
except the Dionne Warwick song.

01:07:51.643 --> 01:07:55.989
I came down and I thought
that it was Birmingham, Alabama.

01:07:56.715 --> 01:07:59.389
The only thing was
I didn't see any African Americans.

01:08:00.385 --> 01:08:04.197
The atmosphere, which often surrounds
much publicized trials,

01:08:04.256 --> 01:08:05.428
is beginning to build.

01:08:06.358 --> 01:08:09.362
More than 300 newsmen
have applied for credentials.

01:08:09.595 --> 01:08:11.302
Three-quarters of a million dollars

01:08:11.363 --> 01:08:14.572
has been spent on
security and facilities for the news media.

01:08:14.766 --> 01:08:19.680
Fences for crowd control, reconstruction
inside and outside the court building.

01:08:20.272 --> 01:08:24.948
The courtroom itself is small with only
60 seats for spectators and newsmen.

01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:28.589
Closed circuit television will
carry the proceedings to another building

01:08:28.647 --> 01:08:30.786
with room for 150 more.

01:08:30.983 --> 01:08:33.429
Questions from both sides
will only be answered

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:36.830
as the evidence unfolds day by day
in the California courtroom,

01:08:36.889 --> 01:08:40.859
and the trial,
estimated to last six to nine months.

01:08:45.531 --> 01:08:48.636
Howard had been on the case from the start.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.712
I had a minimal role in the trial.

01:08:51.803 --> 01:08:54.545
I think I questioned one or two witnesses.

01:08:54.606 --> 01:09:00.648
I was there representing the party
and keeping an eye on the politics.

01:09:01.078 --> 01:09:05.027
And I told them that
I thought she would be convicted.

01:09:05.517 --> 01:09:10.728
I thought the crucial thing was getting
a different approach to the defense.

01:09:10.956 --> 01:09:14.130
And that's what Leo brought to the case.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:18.298
Leo Branton,
who was also African American,

01:09:18.596 --> 01:09:24.309
very dynamic fellow, and very
well-known in the black community in LA.

01:09:24.469 --> 01:09:27.779
He understood his client,

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.151
he understood the situation.

01:09:31.143 --> 01:09:36.421
I felt much more optimistic with him there.

01:09:36.948 --> 01:09:40.294
A trial lawyer
must be somewhat of a showman.

01:09:40.652 --> 01:09:42.188
You are acting in front of a jury.

01:09:42.988 --> 01:09:44.661
You cannot be all actor, though.

01:09:44.723 --> 01:09:46.862
There must be substance
to what you're doing.

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.368
By being passionate about your cause,
being intellectual

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:53.671
and having prepared the case

01:09:53.732 --> 01:09:57.976
to the point where you can make the
best possible presentation before a jury.

01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:02.207
So the stakes are, we have to win
this case, and we have to win it now.

01:10:02.608 --> 01:10:05.817
You either win the case now,
or you forget about it. It's over.

01:10:08.146 --> 01:10:09.750
I was charged with

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.283
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:11.283 --> 01:10:16.596
three crimes that carried the death penalty.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:16.596 --> 01:10:18.490
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:22.000
I tried to avoid actually thinking about that.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.030
I tried to avoid actually thinking about that.

01:10:23.595 --> 01:10:30.570
I tried to avoid thinking about what was,
at that time, a gas chamber.

01:10:32.337 --> 01:10:35.216
Anyone facing the death penalty
was not allowed bail.

01:10:35.641 --> 01:10:41.717
But the trial judge previously stated
that if it weren't for the death penalty,

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:45.819
he would allow Angela Davis
to have bail on appeal.

01:10:47.319 --> 01:10:49.424
You get pressure all the time.

01:10:49.721 --> 01:10:53.168
They'd say, "Kill her, kill her, kill her.
You can do it."

01:10:55.627 --> 01:10:59.871
And I never let that bother me.
I never told anybody about it.

01:11:02.234 --> 01:11:07.081
Today, the small green room
at San Quentin is empty, unused.

01:11:07.873 --> 01:11:10.854
The California Supreme Court
has outlawed the death penalty

01:11:10.909 --> 01:11:13.412
as "cruel" and "unusual" punishment.

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.289
Immediately upon getting this news,

01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:18.390
I called Howard Moore
on the phone, I said,

01:11:18.483 --> 01:11:22.226
"Call the judge and call
the prosecuting attorney, and tell them

01:11:22.287 --> 01:11:25.097
"that you're gonna make a motion
to free Angela Davis on bail."

01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:29.898
Aretha Franklin had said that she would
put up any amount of money for bail.

01:11:30.295 --> 01:11:32.468
And so I was trying to reach her.

01:11:33.699 --> 01:11:35.474
I was trying to call Aretha, man.

01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:39.012
"We need money, honey.
As much as you can give us. "

01:11:39.271 --> 01:11:43.742
Well, she was in the West Indies and
it wasn't possible to make the transfer,

01:11:43.842 --> 01:11:47.255
and I had one other person who said
that they would put up money for bail.

01:11:47.813 --> 01:11:50.726
A white farmer from Fresno, California,

01:11:50.782 --> 01:11:53.456
which is one of the most
conservative areas in the state.

01:11:53.585 --> 01:11:55.792
His name was Rodger McAfee.

01:11:55.921 --> 01:11:57.628
And I said, "Will you do it?"

01:11:57.689 --> 01:11:59.532
And he said, "Yes.

01:11:59.725 --> 01:12:03.571
"I will put up my farm as collateral. "

01:12:05.897 --> 01:12:07.399
When Rodger McAfee goes out

01:12:07.466 --> 01:12:10.379
to feed the cows
on his dairy farm near Fresno,

01:12:10.435 --> 01:12:14.315
he now carries an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle,

01:12:14.439 --> 01:12:16.851
because he says his life and the lives

01:12:16.908 --> 01:12:19.445
of his wife and five children
have been threatened.

01:12:20.178 --> 01:12:23.557
The threats began the day after McAfee
put up some of his farmland

01:12:23.615 --> 01:12:27.153
as security for Angela Davis' bail bonds.

01:12:27.786 --> 01:12:31.529
Angela Davis has always promoted
the path to the freedom of peoples.

01:12:31.757 --> 01:12:35.330
The freedom to speak out and...

01:12:35.427 --> 01:12:37.498
it's our American way of life.

01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:41.509
And when you have constant threats
on your life and etcetera,

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:46.709
that's not freedom. It just shows
we haven't developed far enough yet.

01:12:51.076 --> 01:12:54.057
We're all outside
the courtroom together waiting.

01:12:54.179 --> 01:12:57.786
And Howard comes out loping along,
you know?

01:12:57.849 --> 01:12:59.419
Do some work, some typing.

01:12:59.484 --> 01:13:01.828
And we yell, "What happened?"

01:13:01.887 --> 01:13:03.230
I mean, we didn't know where he was going.

01:13:03.288 --> 01:13:04.358
I'm going to do some typing.

01:13:04.423 --> 01:13:06.994
The man has said he's going to do
some typing and some work,

01:13:07.058 --> 01:13:09.095
and there are no more questions, all right?

01:13:09.194 --> 01:13:12.403
And he turned and he was crying.

01:13:13.031 --> 01:13:16.274
In a choked voice he said,
"We got what we came for."

01:13:18.503 --> 01:13:21.211
After a tense day of
closed door conferences,

01:13:21.273 --> 01:13:24.652
Judge Richard Arnason ruled
Miss Davis should be freed from jail.

01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:28.156
It was the first legal fallout
from the death penalty ruling.

01:13:28.213 --> 01:13:31.057
And the judge's decision
did not please the prosecution.

01:13:31.116 --> 01:13:34.290
I think what he's going to do
is contrary to law.

01:13:34.386 --> 01:13:36.366
Is this appealable? Can you appeal it?

01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:40.096
Well, I suppose we could seek some relief
from the appellate court,

01:13:40.158 --> 01:13:44.300
but the time factor is so short that
I don't think it would be worth the effort.

01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:48.934
Then we got to the bail bondsman's
office. His name was Steve Sparacino.

01:13:49.468 --> 01:13:52.847
Everything closes at 5:00, right?
We wanted to get her out that night.

01:13:52.938 --> 01:13:56.249
And he said, "Well, I don't know.
Should I do this? Should I not do this?"

01:13:56.808 --> 01:14:00.688
And perhaps about four minutes to 5:00,
and he said, "Okay. "

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.790
I'm so happy, boy. I just...

01:14:05.951 --> 01:14:08.488
Kendra said to me, "Go tell Angela."

01:14:12.324 --> 01:14:15.567
When I'm processed through
and I'm allowed into Angela's cell,

01:14:17.262 --> 01:14:20.300
Angela had on a black shawl.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.537
She was getting ready to leave.

01:14:23.635 --> 01:14:28.744
She stood absolutely still for a moment,
and her body rippled.

01:14:28.874 --> 01:14:31.684
There was, like, this little ripple
and then she walked out.

01:14:54.432 --> 01:14:57.003
Her release on bail transformed the trial

01:14:57.068 --> 01:14:59.844
because the presumption of innocence
had been restored.

01:14:59.905 --> 01:15:02.146
She came into the courtroom
as a free person,

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.982
and it transformed everything
about the trial.

01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:42.686
After 17 months of pre-trial activity
and three weeks to pick a jury,

01:15:42.781 --> 01:15:45.159
the Angela Davis trial is ready
to hear evidence.

01:15:45.817 --> 01:15:48.354
Prosecutor Albert Harris
outlined a conspiracy

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:51.367
which he promised to weave
out of circumstantial evidence.

01:15:51.423 --> 01:15:54.370
A plan to take hostages
from a California courthouse

01:15:54.459 --> 01:15:57.269
and use them to free San Quentin prisoners.

01:15:57.796 --> 01:16:01.369
His first motive was political.

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.910
Angela Davis, a communist, a Black Panther,

01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:07.211
a member of the Che Lumumba Club,

01:16:07.839 --> 01:16:13.289
anxious to free the Soledad Brothers
and other political prisoners,

01:16:13.511 --> 01:16:16.754
did this out of revolutionary fervor.

01:16:17.115 --> 01:16:20.585
And then he changed midstream.

01:16:20.952 --> 01:16:24.229
Harris said Miss Davis aided and abetted
that escape attempt

01:16:24.356 --> 01:16:27.929
driven by a passion for Soledad Brother
George Jackson.

01:16:28.059 --> 01:16:30.300
A passion, he said, that knew no bounds.

01:16:30.395 --> 01:16:33.171
When he got up and made this argument,

01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:37.937
it was so stunning.
I'm thinking, like, "Whoa!"

01:16:38.303 --> 01:16:44.151
It was basically an argument that I was...

01:16:46.745 --> 01:16:52.286
I was a person who had uncontrollable
passion because I was a woman.

01:16:52.584 --> 01:16:54.030
In the State's case,

01:16:54.031 --> 01:16:56.931
the primary motive charged
was to free the Soledad Brothers.

01:16:57.589 --> 01:17:00.832
Ironically, at the noon recess,
word reached the courthouse.

01:17:01.259 --> 01:17:03.933
They had been found, "Not guilty."

01:17:04.129 --> 01:17:06.700
- Soledad Brothers got acquitted.
- They got acquitted.

01:17:07.265 --> 01:17:11.873
Soledad Brothers were not guilty
and they've received a just verdict.

01:17:12.037 --> 01:17:13.038
Right on.

01:17:19.377 --> 01:17:21.823
I thought of the idea of having Angela Davis

01:17:22.547 --> 01:17:24.288
to make the opening statement to the jury.

01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:30.522
An opening statement in which she could
tell all about herself all of who she was.

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:36.696
And she got to tell the jury that
without being cross-examined.

01:17:39.931 --> 01:17:43.208
No one has heard
Angela Davis say anything.

01:17:43.435 --> 01:17:46.814
And so, suddenly in the courtroom,

01:17:47.105 --> 01:17:49.676
she had this moment.

01:17:50.475 --> 01:17:53.115
And every eye in the courtroom is on her.

01:17:53.545 --> 01:17:58.085
So the beginning of the trial
was really Angela Davis.

01:17:59.217 --> 01:18:02.824
I'm just gonna read to you.
"The trial's most dramatic development

01:18:02.887 --> 01:18:06.767
"was the defense's opening statement
delivered by the defendant herself.

01:18:07.559 --> 01:18:11.701
"Miss Davis scoffed at the prosecution
of her motive.

01:18:12.297 --> 01:18:14.539
"The suggestion that
her love for Jackson

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:16.940
"had driven her to crime, she said,

01:18:17.068 --> 01:18:22.211
"was utterly fantastic, utterly absurd.

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.780
"Clear evidence of male chauvinism."

01:18:27.512 --> 01:18:29.492
I mean, nobody expected that.

01:18:29.814 --> 01:18:33.523
You know, here's the beginning of a trial
that everyone thinks is black and white.

01:18:33.618 --> 01:18:36.758
And what is she bringing up
in her opening statement,

01:18:36.988 --> 01:18:38.934
but male chauvinism. Quite interesting.

01:18:50.268 --> 01:18:56.685
Harris, in the early days,
brought on a lot of witnesses

01:18:56.775 --> 01:18:58.812
to basically make the ground for his case.

01:19:05.416 --> 01:19:07.862
I was working in the darkroom,
mixing fixer that day.

01:19:07.919 --> 01:19:10.525
And I heard on the police monitor
that there was a...

01:19:10.588 --> 01:19:12.534
They called a code 33.

01:19:12.857 --> 01:19:17.135
Armed convicts with hostages at the
Marin County Civic Center Hall of Justice.

01:19:18.029 --> 01:19:21.306
There was a shooting, there were
witnesses, so-and-so saw so-and-so.

01:19:23.535 --> 01:19:26.675
I was across the archway
from where they were exiting.

01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:28.973
And about that time somebody said,
"Here they come."

01:19:30.074 --> 01:19:31.747
And there were a lot of exhibits.

01:19:31.943 --> 01:19:33.786
The stick, that gun.

01:19:35.046 --> 01:19:37.026
And the next thing I knew,
I got a black man

01:19:37.081 --> 01:19:39.459
with a .357 Magnum
aimed at my head saying,

01:19:39.517 --> 01:19:41.861
"Stand up, motherfucker,
or I'll blow your brains out."

01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:50.696
Harris then continued
for days and days and weeks,

01:19:51.429 --> 01:19:54.672
putting on exhibit, after exhibit,
after exhibit.

01:19:54.732 --> 01:19:56.837
And witness, after witness, after witness.

01:19:58.369 --> 01:20:02.010
What I saw,
I saw through the lens of a camera.

01:20:02.106 --> 01:20:04.245
My photographs were my testimony.

01:20:05.777 --> 01:20:08.485
I think he presented 104 witnesses

01:20:08.546 --> 01:20:12.426
to overwhelm the jury with
what had happened on August 7th.

01:20:18.256 --> 01:20:23.137
It was David and Goliath, you know?
And Angela was David.

01:20:27.732 --> 01:20:34.115
The trial, for Harris, it was a hugely
important assignment for him.

01:20:34.739 --> 01:20:35.979
Huge.

01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:41.054
He was the one
who had to carry the government.

01:20:42.614 --> 01:20:46.528
Albert Harris was not
a prosecuting attorney.

01:20:46.818 --> 01:20:50.630
All the prosecuting attorneys
had been disqualified

01:20:50.688 --> 01:20:56.900
because one of the victims of the crime
was a district attorney.

01:20:57.795 --> 01:21:02.039
And so the Attorney General
took over as prosecutors.

01:21:02.734 --> 01:21:07.479
So we had the advantage of having
better trial lawyers than they were.

01:21:10.942 --> 01:21:14.617
Leo Branton made an argument
that was stunning.

01:21:14.913 --> 01:21:19.564
That some of the most
unreliable testimony you'll ever hear

01:21:19.565 --> 01:21:20.865
is eyewitness testimony.

01:21:21.119 --> 01:21:23.998
Seated at the counsel table,

01:21:24.055 --> 01:21:26.001
in addition to Angela and the lawyers,

01:21:26.891 --> 01:21:33.137
was Kendra Alexander,
who's a close friend of Angela's,

01:21:33.431 --> 01:21:35.877
and the head of the defense committee.

01:21:36.134 --> 01:21:39.172
One day, when he had
this very hostile witness,

01:21:39.237 --> 01:21:40.511
the guy even called him bald-headed,

01:21:41.072 --> 01:21:45.043
and he was identifying Angela Davis as
being the one and he saw her.

01:21:45.176 --> 01:21:46.814
They just kept egging this guy on.

01:21:46.911 --> 01:21:50.518
They said, "Can you identify her?"
"Yes, that's her, right there."

01:21:50.715 --> 01:21:53.127
And he chose Kendra.

01:21:53.551 --> 01:21:56.293
It was an astounding moment.

01:21:56.387 --> 01:22:01.132
And it revealed Leo's brilliant lawyering.

01:22:01.492 --> 01:22:04.962
He set the guy up, that's really
what he did. He set the guy up.

01:22:06.264 --> 01:22:10.474
You know these things,
the cumulative effect on the jurors.

01:22:11.302 --> 01:22:13.839
But just the very idea
of making that argument

01:22:13.972 --> 01:22:19.388
saying, "Eyewitness testimony is some
of the most unreliable you'll ever get."

01:22:20.078 --> 01:22:21.524
That didn't
strike me right.

01:22:21.525 --> 01:22:24.425
But then when you see them
cross-examine these people,

01:22:24.482 --> 01:22:27.326
and there are these people saying,
"This is what I saw with my own eyes."

01:22:27.385 --> 01:22:31.629
It seemed to be so...
Just tear their testimony up.

01:22:32.123 --> 01:22:35.229
Makes you really think about
the eyewitness testimony, you know.

01:22:43.501 --> 01:22:48.041
The prosecutor, Mr. Harris,
believed he had a case.

01:22:49.007 --> 01:22:53.353
And I think the most powerful item
that he had

01:22:53.945 --> 01:22:56.482
were what were referred to as "the letters."

01:22:57.181 --> 01:23:02.028
Angela had written letters to George
when he was still in Soledad Prison.

01:23:03.221 --> 01:23:08.227
Those letters which were, you know,
very passionate and very emotional,

01:23:08.292 --> 01:23:10.772
and, you know, all about love,

01:23:10.828 --> 01:23:15.243
but struggle and revolution.
It was all entangled.

01:23:16.234 --> 01:23:22.344
But he wanted to use this
as the primary evidence of my guilt.

01:23:23.274 --> 01:23:26.744
The defense did not
want these letters in there.

01:23:27.011 --> 01:23:29.787
And the prosecution wanted them in there,

01:23:29.847 --> 01:23:31.024
because they said,

01:23:31.025 --> 01:23:33.125
"You read these letters,
you'll understand why she did this."

01:23:34.652 --> 01:23:36.928
Here's a quote, it's from Harris.

01:23:37.522 --> 01:23:42.164
"You will find, I think, from the letters,
a willingness on the part of the defendant

01:23:42.393 --> 01:23:47.365
"to do whatever she felt had to be done
to free George Jackson."

01:23:47.698 --> 01:23:51.145
It was as though the letters
were meant to, in fact, say,

01:23:51.269 --> 01:23:55.809
"Look, I'll free you. And I'm so in love
with you, I'll do anything for you."

01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:56.941
You know?

01:23:57.408 --> 01:23:59.684
Leo was incensed, okay.

01:23:59.744 --> 01:24:02.588
He was really incensed about
putting in this diary,

01:24:02.647 --> 01:24:04.092
and particularly this part of the diary

01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:07.760
where Angela is
expressing herself in this way.

01:24:08.186 --> 01:24:14.034
Now, Branton, he stood on his feet,
and put his hand here, in his jacket,

01:24:14.092 --> 01:24:18.802
and this arm was way out in front,
and he was just saying,

01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:21.536
"These are not admissible."

01:24:22.033 --> 01:24:23.103
So, we fought.

01:24:23.167 --> 01:24:27.138
I mean, some of the heaviest fighting in
the case was over editing this letter.

01:24:28.072 --> 01:24:30.746
The judge comes in
with his sweeping black robes,

01:24:30.808 --> 01:24:33.482
and he kind of steps up the steps,
and he sits down.

01:24:33.878 --> 01:24:36.722
The courtroom is very nervous
and sitting forward,

01:24:36.981 --> 01:24:38.517
and no one's looking at anyone else.

01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:44.996
Arnason takes the 18 pages,
came back with three pages.

01:24:47.125 --> 01:24:52.803
And so he read some of the letters in court.

01:24:53.798 --> 01:24:58.713
"I, your wife, your comrade,
who's supposed to love you,

01:24:58.769 --> 01:25:01.511
"fight with you, fight for you,

01:25:01.572 --> 01:25:03.882
"I'm supposed to rip off the chains.

01:25:03.941 --> 01:25:06.854
"I'm supposed to fight your enemies
with my body,

01:25:06.978 --> 01:25:09.822
"but I am helpless, powerless.

01:25:09.981 --> 01:25:12.484
"I contain a rage inside

01:25:12.683 --> 01:25:16.426
"as I re-experience this now,
my pulse beats faster.

01:25:16.621 --> 01:25:19.397
"I begin to breathe harder. And I see myself

01:25:19.457 --> 01:25:22.904
"tearing down this steel door,
fighting my way to you,

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:26.305
"ripping down your cell door
and letting you go free.

01:25:27.231 --> 01:25:30.872
"I feel as you do, so terribly is this love."

01:25:31.736 --> 01:25:34.478
If I had been the prosecutor,
I would try to put that in, too.

01:25:40.311 --> 01:25:41.860
It was very painful

01:25:41.861 --> 01:25:47.161
to have my expressions
of my deepest emotional feelings

01:25:47.218 --> 01:25:53.931
splashed across the newspaper as a
result of having been revealed in court.

01:25:53.991 --> 01:25:56.631
It was very difficult, yeah.
It was very difficult.

01:26:12.076 --> 01:26:16.525
Doris Walker and Margaret Burnham
had been in charge of our witnesses.

01:26:16.981 --> 01:26:20.326
They had a whole slew of people
lined up to testify.

01:26:20.585 --> 01:26:23.595
And what we ultimately
decided was that

01:26:23.596 --> 01:26:25.296
we should not appear to be defensive.

01:26:25.423 --> 01:26:29.428
And we should only have witnesses
for very specific points

01:26:29.493 --> 01:26:31.336
that might be confusing to the jury.

01:26:31.562 --> 01:26:33.303
Just imagine.

01:26:35.099 --> 01:26:39.070
This judge is taken out of the courtroom
with a shotgun

01:26:40.238 --> 01:26:43.708
and you have someone
that buys these weapons,

01:26:43.975 --> 01:26:46.751
but what makes that fall apart is,

01:26:47.111 --> 01:26:49.455
why, if that was the plan,

01:26:49.614 --> 01:26:55.292
why would she use her own
identification to purchase these weapons?

01:26:55.386 --> 01:26:58.799
Basically, your defense is, and I think
Leo Branton said it just like this,

01:26:58.856 --> 01:27:03.032
"Angela Davis is not stupid.
You know she's not stupid.

01:27:03.094 --> 01:27:05.096
"She had to be stupid to buy these guns,

01:27:05.263 --> 01:27:07.504
"knowing that we were going to know
that she bought them

01:27:07.565 --> 01:27:10.637
"and they're going to be
the weapons in this crime."

01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:13.579
Carefully, without emotion,

01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:16.380
the prosecutor
wound up his case against Angela Davis.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.613
"She conspired to kidnap and murder, "
he said,

01:27:18.743 --> 01:27:20.555
"because of a passionate desire

01:27:20.556 --> 01:27:23.056
"to free her lover,
Soledad Brother George Jackson."

01:27:23.614 --> 01:27:26.220
Prosecutor Albert Harris
showed the guns she bought.

01:27:26.284 --> 01:27:28.355
He reviewed the testimony of witnesses

01:27:28.519 --> 01:27:31.523
who saw her with a young man
who later used those guns.

01:27:32.056 --> 01:27:35.902
"This case is all about death, injury
and kidnapping," Harris said.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.099
"And Angela Davis is responsible."

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:45.076
"Assistant Attorney General Albert W. Harris

01:27:45.269 --> 01:27:49.081
"quietly turned from the wooden lectern
in the middle of the courtroom

01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:54.216
"and walked a few steps to
the prosecuting attorney's table.

01:27:54.712 --> 01:27:57.852
"He glanced down
at a pile of papers on his desk,

01:27:57.915 --> 01:28:02.386
"and announced, undramatically,
'The People rest their case."'

01:28:05.589 --> 01:28:08.729
He did a magnificent job

01:28:08.959 --> 01:28:12.406
of taking all of these pieces,
and pulling them all together

01:28:12.463 --> 01:28:14.465
and telling you what to think.

01:28:15.299 --> 01:28:17.006
I said...

01:28:17.702 --> 01:28:20.182
"I believe Angela's gone."

01:28:23.474 --> 01:28:25.579
Leo told me, "See, now, Howard,

01:28:26.077 --> 01:28:29.650
"you're gonna take the eyewitnesses.
They're yours."

01:28:30.281 --> 01:28:32.955
So I emphasized
the presumption of innocence,

01:28:33.784 --> 01:28:35.661
the question of reasonable doubt,

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:39.190
and I attacked each one
of the eyewitnesses.

01:28:39.924 --> 01:28:43.462
Then we paused and we set up the stage,

01:28:44.228 --> 01:28:48.005
and my brother, Leo, rose to the occasion.

01:28:48.366 --> 01:28:52.746
I knew that I had to prove

01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:55.980
that Angela's flight
was not evidence of guilt.

01:28:57.141 --> 01:28:58.711
I said to the jury,

01:28:59.009 --> 01:29:01.285
"I want you to play a role with me.

01:29:02.246 --> 01:29:06.991
"For the next several minutes,
I want you to think black.

01:29:08.252 --> 01:29:10.789
"I want you to be black.

01:29:10.921 --> 01:29:11.956
"Don't worry.

01:29:12.456 --> 01:29:15.027
"I'll let you return to being white
when this is over.

01:29:16.193 --> 01:29:18.036
"If you're black,

01:29:18.896 --> 01:29:22.935
"you know that your fore parents were
brought to this country as slaves.

01:29:23.401 --> 01:29:27.144
"And the United States
Supreme Court ruled,

01:29:27.905 --> 01:29:29.976
"'There are no rights

01:29:32.109 --> 01:29:37.457
"'that a black person has
that a white man is bound to respect.'

01:29:38.449 --> 01:29:41.692
"An intellectual like Angela Davis knew this.

01:29:42.553 --> 01:29:48.902
"She also knew that during the '60s,
every time a black person raised his voice

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:54.505
"in support of liberty and the freedom
of the black man, he was assassinated.

01:29:54.932 --> 01:29:57.879
"And so if you know all of those things,

01:29:58.235 --> 01:30:00.545
"if you are Angela Davis,

01:30:00.838 --> 01:30:02.613
"or if you're black,

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.646
"you don't wonder why she fled.

01:30:05.843 --> 01:30:11.054
"You only wonder why in the world
did she allow herself to be caught?"

01:30:16.287 --> 01:30:19.734
Defense attorney, Leo Branton, said
he did not know who the person was

01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:23.294
that the prosecution witnesses
had identified as Angela Davis.

01:30:23.394 --> 01:30:25.635
But he said it wasn't his job to find out.

01:30:25.696 --> 01:30:28.108
"Angela Davis is no fool," he continued.

01:30:28.165 --> 01:30:30.907
"Why would she buy a gun
to blow a judge's head off

01:30:30.968 --> 01:30:32.606
"and buy it in her own name?

01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:35.116
"The prosecution's theory is absurd."

01:30:35.172 --> 01:30:39.211
The jury will begin deliberating
her guilt or innocence tomorrow.

01:31:13.911 --> 01:31:15.891
We were sitting on the lawn.

01:31:15.946 --> 01:31:19.120
Franklin came out
and he said, "They've reached a verdict."

01:31:23.787 --> 01:31:26.893
And I was standing next to Mrs. Davis,
Angela's mother.

01:31:27.191 --> 01:31:30.536
And she said to me, "I can't go in.

01:31:30.895 --> 01:31:33.000
"I just... I can't go in." She couldn't bear it.

01:31:33.130 --> 01:31:36.111
She wanted to be with her own thoughts,

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:40.706
and she obviously didn't think
she could maintain her composure.

01:31:40.771 --> 01:31:42.808
And it was Angela who reached out to her
and said,

01:31:42.873 --> 01:31:44.511
"Mom, you've got to come."

01:31:58.689 --> 01:32:02.398
There was a way in which we were all
kind of in our own silos.

01:32:03.027 --> 01:32:07.476
When we came into the courtroom
with, you know, obviously, solidarity,

01:32:07.531 --> 01:32:10.538
but we were all also
just steeling ourselves

01:32:10.539 --> 01:32:13.539
for whatever that jury was going to say.

01:32:16.206 --> 01:32:18.345
And the jury walks in,

01:32:18.409 --> 01:32:21.686
and then Margaret falls apart completely.

01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:26.660
So, I'm in a situation where
I'm having to help Margaret,

01:32:28.152 --> 01:32:32.532
and she kind of stretched her arms out.

01:32:33.324 --> 01:32:37.568
And then Franklin started crying.
He was in the audience.

01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:42.340
And the judge says,
"Have you reached a verdict?"

01:32:42.399 --> 01:32:44.936
And Mrs. Timothy said,
"Yes, Your Honor, we have."

01:32:45.402 --> 01:32:51.114
The jury hands the jury slip to the clerk,
and the clerk then hands it to the judge,

01:32:51.175 --> 01:32:53.086
and the judge then looks at it,

01:32:53.143 --> 01:32:57.091
and you look at the judge
to see if he's happy or sad,

01:32:57.147 --> 01:32:59.650
or if he's giving away anything.

01:32:59.717 --> 01:33:02.857
And no judge ever does at that moment.

01:33:04.254 --> 01:33:06.598
The court clerk reads out the charge.

01:33:07.291 --> 01:33:11.364
"In the case of Angela Davis
on the charge of first degree murder,

01:33:11.428 --> 01:33:13.169
"how does the jury find?"

01:33:13.864 --> 01:33:15.537
And she said, "Not guilty."

01:33:16.467 --> 01:33:18.105
And then they read the second one.

01:33:18.168 --> 01:33:20.808
"First degree kidnapping,
how does the jury find?"

01:33:21.705 --> 01:33:22.809
"Not guilty."

01:33:23.407 --> 01:33:27.480
And then the clerk read out the next
charge, which was the conspiracy,

01:33:27.678 --> 01:33:29.419
and that's the one
we were most nervous about.

01:33:30.714 --> 01:33:34.184
I think I stopped breathing.
Everybody was just sobbing.

01:33:35.686 --> 01:33:40.026
Angela reached over
to touch her mother,

01:33:40.027 --> 01:33:42.627
who was sitting right behind her.

01:33:44.128 --> 01:33:45.971
And she said, "Not guilty."

01:33:52.336 --> 01:33:57.376
And there came the yell, "Power
to the people! Power to the people!

01:33:57.541 --> 01:33:58.884
"Power to the people!"

01:33:59.209 --> 01:34:02.150
And then they started,
"Power to the jury.

01:34:02.151 --> 01:34:04.751
"Power to the jury. Power to the jury."

01:34:29.807 --> 01:34:32.879
Today's verdict climaxed the trial
which many have viewed

01:34:32.943 --> 01:34:35.924
as a testing ground
for the American judicial system.

01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:41.056
Supporters said political and racial bias
would prevent a fair trial.

01:34:41.418 --> 01:34:43.091
But despite these claims,

01:34:43.153 --> 01:34:47.898
today in San Jose, an all-white jury
acquitted Angela Davis.

01:35:06.844 --> 01:35:10.053
The simple truth obvious to all long ago
was this,

01:35:10.114 --> 01:35:12.924
there never was a legal case against Angela.

01:35:12.983 --> 01:35:17.398
But the political necessity for such a trial
was incontrovertible for the state.

01:35:17.454 --> 01:35:19.058
That is why it is so important

01:35:19.123 --> 01:35:22.263
that this state's conspiracy to get Angela
was smashed.

01:35:23.127 --> 01:35:25.664
Just general reaction.
Could you just take off and rap?

01:35:28.565 --> 01:35:31.239
I think you've been able to see
from all of the celebrating

01:35:31.301 --> 01:35:33.872
that has already taken place here
what my reaction is

01:35:33.937 --> 01:35:36.144
and the reaction
of the members of my family.

01:35:36.206 --> 01:35:39.380
And all of the sisters and brothers who
have been struggling for my freedom.

01:35:39.576 --> 01:35:41.613
This is the happiest day of my life.

01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:46.985
Throughout this country, people are
becoming increasingly aware

01:35:47.050 --> 01:35:49.656
of the fact that whatever
the government does,

01:35:49.753 --> 01:35:52.859
is not a priori the truth.

01:35:52.923 --> 01:35:55.563
And it's not only the struggle around
political prisoners

01:35:55.626 --> 01:35:58.232
that has begun to change
the climate in this country

01:35:58.295 --> 01:36:01.208
so that an acquittal like this could occur.

01:36:02.065 --> 01:36:04.511
But also the reaction to the war in Vietnam

01:36:04.601 --> 01:36:08.378
and the reaction to Nixon's
economic policies.

01:36:08.605 --> 01:36:11.051
I think there's a lot more resistance now.

01:36:11.108 --> 01:36:15.386
And that means that we have to continue
to build that resistance

01:36:15.445 --> 01:36:17.254
and allow it to mature.

01:36:18.448 --> 01:36:23.420
This was not something
that we could set aside

01:36:23.887 --> 01:36:28.632
and say, "This is over.
Now let's get on with our lives."

01:36:28.692 --> 01:36:31.730
This was the way in which
we were creating our lives.

01:36:31.795 --> 01:36:34.742
This is the way we were choosing
to live our lives.

01:37:27.217 --> 01:37:29.527
Sisters and brothers,

01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:33.763
this is really a beautiful, beautiful moment.

01:37:36.793 --> 01:37:39.774
It would have been a little hard to imagine

01:37:40.097 --> 01:37:42.236
22 long months ago

01:37:42.299 --> 01:37:46.247
that tonight, thousands and thousands
and thousands of people

01:37:46.303 --> 01:37:49.079
are here at Madison Square Garden

01:37:49.139 --> 01:37:53.281
celebrating a magnificent people's victory!

01:38:38.755 --> 01:38:42.567
I was so glad that
that part of my life was over.

01:38:45.195 --> 01:38:49.541
At the same time, all of this energy
that had been generated.

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:51.937
We sat down to talk about

01:38:52.202 --> 01:38:55.740
how we could keep that structure in place

01:38:55.806 --> 01:38:57.376
and how we could go on

01:38:57.441 --> 01:39:00.684
in order to bring more victories
to more people.

01:39:06.650 --> 01:39:11.463
That became the theme of my life.
And here I am today.
