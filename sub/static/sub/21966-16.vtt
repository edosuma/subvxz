00:03.125 --> 00:05.291
Citizens of Griffin Rock,

00:05.333 --> 00:09.083
welcome to our Founders' Day

00:05.333 --> 00:09.083
celebration!

00:09.125 --> 00:12.667
( band plays fanfare )

00:12.709 --> 00:16.625
The anniversary of the day

00:12.709 --> 00:16.625
Horace Burns established

00:16.667 --> 00:20.250
our fair town.

00:16.667 --> 00:20.250
Now since that time,

00:20.291 --> 00:23.208
Griffin Rock has seen

00:20.291 --> 00:23.208
many other great leaders,

00:23.250 --> 00:27.500
including, ahem, yours truly.

00:27.542 --> 00:30.792
If this speech lasts any longer,

00:27.542 --> 00:30.792
your torch may go out.

00:30.834 --> 00:32.625
Don't be nervous, sis.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.917
Representing generations

00:32.667 --> 00:34.917
of our family,

00:34.959 --> 00:36.625
everybody watching,

00:34.959 --> 00:36.625
no pressure.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.000
I'm not nervous,

00:36.667 --> 00:38.000
I'm honored.

00:38.041 --> 00:39.709
Well, I'm nervous.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.250
Blades, all you have to do

00:41.291 --> 00:43.083
is lift me up to light

00:41.291 --> 00:43.083
the ceremonial flame.

00:43.125 --> 00:45.166
Yeah, there's a good idea.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.375
Wave a burning stick

00:45.208 --> 00:47.375
in a gusty wind.

00:47.417 --> 00:49.333
All fire code requirements

00:47.417 --> 00:49.333
for this ceremony

00:49.375 --> 00:52.208
have been met, Heatwave.

00:49.375 --> 00:52.208
I saw to it personally.

00:52.250 --> 00:55.333
I'd still be a lot happier

00:52.250 --> 00:55.333
with less open flame.

00:55.375 --> 01:00.333
Not only is Danielle Burns

00:55.375 --> 01:00.333
an experienced first responder,

01:00.375 --> 01:02.917
and a descendant of Horace,

01:02.959 --> 01:05.250
she also organized

01:02.959 --> 01:05.250
Griffin Rock's

01:05.291 --> 01:10.417
extremely successful

01:05.291 --> 01:10.417
clothing drive for the mainland.

01:10.458 --> 01:15.500
And so this year, Dani has been

01:10.458 --> 01:15.500
chosen to light this flame.

01:15.542 --> 01:18.250
MAN:

01:15.542 --> 01:18.250
Don't count on it, Mr. Mayor!

01:18.291 --> 01:20.625
( all chattering )

01:20.667 --> 01:22.417
Huxley Prescott reporting.

01:22.458 --> 01:25.583
Once again ripping the lid

01:22.458 --> 01:25.583
off the scandals

01:25.625 --> 01:28.417
and secrets of Griffin Rock.

01:28.458 --> 01:32.417
At this very moment, I am

01:28.458 --> 01:32.417
holding proof that the Burnses

01:32.458 --> 01:36.875
are not the upright family

01:32.458 --> 01:36.875
everyone thinks they are.

01:36.917 --> 01:38.458
Huxley, what's all

01:36.917 --> 01:38.458
this about?

01:38.500 --> 01:40.375
It's about a skeleton

01:38.500 --> 01:40.375
in the closet, chief.

01:40.417 --> 01:43.041
Your family's closet.

01:43.083 --> 01:45.875
There's a skeleton

01:43.083 --> 01:45.875
in the closet at the firehouse?

01:45.917 --> 01:47.834
I'll explain later.

01:47.875 --> 01:51.625
I'm referring, of course,

01:47.875 --> 01:51.625
to Horace Burns' wife, Bertha.

01:51.667 --> 01:55.500
Or should I say,

01:51.667 --> 01:55.500
Bertha the Pirate?

01:55.542 --> 01:57.041
Pirate?

01:57.083 --> 02:00.291
And not just any pirate,

01:57.083 --> 02:00.291
but the pirate!

02:00.333 --> 02:03.333
Who, in 1652, stole a fortune

02:03.375 --> 02:07.625
from Ye Old Griffin Rock

02:03.375 --> 02:07.625
Guild Hall Charity Fund.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.208
( all gasp )

02:09.250 --> 02:11.792
Huxley, what makes you think

02:09.250 --> 02:11.792
this Bertha the Pirate

02:11.834 --> 02:14.750
was the same Bertha as my

02:11.834 --> 02:14.750
great-great-great grandmother?

02:14.792 --> 02:17.542
Good question, Ms. Burns.

02:17.583 --> 02:20.875
Yo-ho-ho

02:17.583 --> 02:20.875
and a bottle of that!

02:20.917 --> 02:23.041
( crowd gasps )

02:24.709 --> 02:28.291
Dani Burns begotten by pirates?

02:28.333 --> 02:32.208
Well, obviously, I'll just have

02:28.333 --> 02:32.208
to light the torch myself.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.625
But Mayor, I'm not--

02:33.667 --> 02:35.000
Mr. Mayor, please.

02:35.041 --> 02:38.000
Griffin Rock

02:35.041 --> 02:38.000
has been betrayed!

02:38.041 --> 02:39.250
Mayor, look out!

02:39.291 --> 02:40.875
( sniffing )

02:40.917 --> 02:44.208

(  dramatic theme playing  )

03:46.875 --> 03:49.333
( coughing )

03:49.375 --> 03:52.208
Aah! My hair!

03:52.250 --> 03:54.583
Is this how

03:52.250 --> 03:54.583
you handle a crisis?

03:54.625 --> 03:59.166
Oh, just like pirates

03:54.625 --> 03:59.166
to ruin this day.

03:59.208 --> 04:03.625
Don't think for a minute

03:59.208 --> 04:03.625
you'll ever light that torch.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.834
But you started the fire.

04:05.875 --> 04:08.500
Now you're spreading

04:05.875 --> 04:08.500
accusations!

04:08.542 --> 04:11.750
If you think I'm leaving

04:08.542 --> 04:11.750
the safety of Griffin Rock

04:11.792 --> 04:15.125
in the hands

04:11.792 --> 04:15.125
of you buccaneer Burnses

04:15.166 --> 04:17.750
you've got

04:15.166 --> 04:17.750
another thing coming.

04:17.792 --> 04:19.917
Mr. Mayor, listen to reason.

04:19.959 --> 04:25.667
Chief Burns, you and your

04:19.959 --> 04:25.667
entire family are suspended!

04:25.709 --> 04:27.208
What?

04:25.709 --> 04:27.208
That's ridiculous!

04:27.250 --> 04:28.500
Mayor Luskey!

04:27.250 --> 04:28.500
Are you kidding?

04:28.542 --> 04:30.875
( squish )

04:30.917 --> 04:32.208
( gasps )

04:35.125 --> 04:37.542
And your little Bots too!

04:38.792 --> 04:42.875
Mr. Alper, Milo,

04:38.792 --> 04:42.875
Mr. Harrison, follow me.

04:42.917 --> 04:46.291
we're forming

04:42.917 --> 04:46.291
a citizen safety board.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.583
I don't understand.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.750
How can you be judged for the

04:51.625 --> 04:54.750
actions of somebody in the past?

04:54.792 --> 04:56.625
CODY:

04:54.792 --> 04:56.625
I've never

04:54.792 --> 04:56.625
understood it either.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.750
My teacher Mrs. Murphy

04:56.667 --> 04:58.750
still yells at me

04:58.792 --> 05:00.875
for all the trouble

04:58.792 --> 05:00.875
Kade caused in school.

05:00.917 --> 05:02.333
And that was years ago.

05:02.375 --> 05:03.792
Ah, sorry, Code.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.959
But looking back,

05:03.834 --> 05:05.959
it was so worth it.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.625
For the record,

05:06.000 --> 05:07.625
I have witnessed

05:07.667 --> 05:09.500
no piratical activity

05:07.667 --> 05:09.500
amongst your family.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.250
and would swear so

05:09.542 --> 05:11.250
in a court of law.

05:11.291 --> 05:14.250
Thanks, Chase.

05:11.291 --> 05:14.250
I hope it doesn't come to that.

05:14.291 --> 05:16.625
Dani Burns, Griffin Rock

05:14.291 --> 05:16.625
wants to know

05:16.667 --> 05:20.834
if you have any comment

05:16.667 --> 05:20.834
on your spiral into disgrace?

05:20.875 --> 05:22.417
Nothing fit for TV.

05:22.458 --> 05:23.834
Where did you

05:22.458 --> 05:23.834
find this painting?

05:23.875 --> 05:25.375
And who told you those lies?

05:25.417 --> 05:29.125
A reporter never reveals

05:25.417 --> 05:29.125
his source.

05:29.166 --> 05:32.333
Maybe not.

05:29.166 --> 05:32.333
But most reporters didn't sing

05:32.375 --> 05:34.792
a karaoke disco medley at last

05:32.375 --> 05:34.792
year's Lobster Fest.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.291
Ooh, ooh! Chika-chika!

05:37.333 --> 05:39.875
Should I show

05:37.333 --> 05:39.875
your audience?

05:39.917 --> 05:43.125
Uh-- This is Huxley Prescott,

05:43.166 --> 05:46.458
protecting his sources

05:43.166 --> 05:46.458
and signing off!

05:46.500 --> 05:49.625
You and your

05:46.500 --> 05:49.625
wily pirate ways.

05:49.667 --> 05:52.875
All right, then. I learned

05:49.667 --> 05:52.875
all of this from your uncle,

05:52.917 --> 05:56.166
Woodrow Burns.

05:52.917 --> 05:56.166
You'll find him in the library.

05:57.834 --> 05:59.041
CODY:

05:57.834 --> 05:59.041
Uncle Woodrow!

05:59.083 --> 06:02.041
Well, hello, family.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.375
Shh!

06:03.417 --> 06:05.542
( whispering )

06:03.417 --> 06:05.542
Hello, family?

06:05.583 --> 06:07.875
Is that all you have

06:05.583 --> 06:07.875
to say for yourself?

06:07.917 --> 06:10.750
We were all just suspended

06:07.917 --> 06:10.750
because of what you told Huxley.

06:10.792 --> 06:12.458
What? But why?

06:12.500 --> 06:15.625
All I told him was that

06:12.500 --> 06:15.625
we had a pirate ancestor.

06:15.667 --> 06:16.917
LIBRARIAN:

06:15.667 --> 06:16.917
Shush!

06:18.500 --> 06:21.917
Let's go somewhere

06:18.500 --> 06:21.917
where we can talk.

06:21.959 --> 06:25.041
BURNS:

06:21.959 --> 06:25.041
All right, Woodrow,

06:21.959 --> 06:25.041
first of all,

06:25.083 --> 06:27.959
Why would you say that

06:25.083 --> 06:27.959
to Huxley before telling us?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.917
We didn't even know

06:28.000 --> 06:29.917
you were in town.

06:29.959 --> 06:33.792
Because I wanted to surprise

06:29.959 --> 06:33.792
you all with the good news.

06:33.834 --> 06:37.041
Good news? What, our

06:33.834 --> 06:37.041
great-uncle is Count Dracula?

06:37.083 --> 06:38.875
No, I'm talking about

06:38.917 --> 06:40.709
what I found while

06:38.917 --> 06:40.709
researching the family.

06:40.750 --> 06:43.709
The map to Bertha's

06:40.750 --> 06:43.709
lost treasure.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.000
A treasure map?

06:43.750 --> 06:46.000
Noble!

06:46.041 --> 06:48.125
So there really was

06:46.041 --> 06:48.125
a treasure?

06:48.166 --> 06:51.792
I thought all that pirate in the

06:48.166 --> 06:51.792
family stuff was just a legend.

06:51.834 --> 06:55.208
Unfortunately, Bertha's theft

06:51.834 --> 06:55.208
of the Guild Hall Charity Fund

06:55.250 --> 06:57.542
is well-documented

06:55.250 --> 06:57.542
by historians.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.750
Tsk, tsk. A blemish upon

06:57.583 --> 07:00.750
the Burns family name.

07:00.792 --> 07:04.000
That was a long time ago.

07:00.792 --> 07:04.000
What difference does it make?

07:04.041 --> 07:06.333
You're right. It just

07:04.041 --> 07:06.333
doesn't seem fair.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.458
It might not even be

07:06.375 --> 07:08.458
the same Bertha.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.166
This painting

07:08.500 --> 07:10.166
doesn't prove anything.

07:10.208 --> 07:13.125
This map will definitely

07:10.208 --> 07:13.125
help clear things up.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.208
Except...

07:15.250 --> 07:19.417
it doesn't specify exactly

07:15.250 --> 07:19.417
where these islands are.

07:19.458 --> 07:22.083
I was hoping maybe

07:19.458 --> 07:22.083
you Bots could help.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.500
Hmm, let me take a look.

07:28.083 --> 07:31.083
I'm running it through

07:28.083 --> 07:31.083
the database. No matches yet.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.875
Wait a minute.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.333
Boulder, can you

07:33.917 --> 07:35.333
invert the image?

07:35.375 --> 07:37.792
Make the dark parts light

07:35.375 --> 07:37.792
and vice versa,

07:37.834 --> 07:39.083
like a photograph negative?

07:41.250 --> 07:44.375
Those aren't islands.

07:41.250 --> 07:44.375
It's water.

07:44.417 --> 07:46.041
And this is the shoreline.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.750
It's the cove by the sea caves

07:47.834 --> 07:50.750
Near the Griffin Keys.

07:50.792 --> 07:53.875
Bertha was known

07:50.792 --> 07:53.875
to frequent those caves.

07:53.917 --> 07:56.083
This is good a place

07:53.917 --> 07:56.083
to start as any.

07:56.125 --> 07:59.166
A reverse map? She must

07:56.125 --> 07:59.166
have been pretty clever.

07:59.208 --> 08:03.208
Well, Burns family,

07:59.208 --> 08:03.208
time for an adventure.

08:03.250 --> 08:06.834
Sorry, Woody. I'm not following

08:03.250 --> 08:06.834
you on another wild good chase.

08:06.875 --> 08:08.792
It does seem

08:06.875 --> 08:08.792
like a long shot.

08:08.834 --> 08:11.208
I think you've been

08:08.834 --> 08:11.208
punked by a pirate.

08:11.250 --> 08:14.333
I'll go, Uncle Woodrow.

08:11.250 --> 08:14.333
If it's okay, Dad.

08:14.375 --> 08:16.166
Well--

08:16.208 --> 08:19.166
And don't worry, Charlie.

08:16.208 --> 08:19.166
I'll keep an eye on Cody.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.041
And I'll keep an eye

08:19.208 --> 08:21.041
on Uncle Woodrow.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.625
Seriously?

08:21.083 --> 08:23.625
Treasure hunting?

08:23.667 --> 08:25.417
I want to get

08:23.667 --> 08:25.417
to the bottom of this

08:25.458 --> 08:28.000
and clear the Burns

08:25.458 --> 08:28.000
family name. And my face.

08:28.041 --> 08:31.500
Argh!

08:28.041 --> 08:31.500
Shiver me timbers, matey!

08:31.542 --> 08:33.458
I'm on board too!

08:34.959 --> 08:36.750
( traffic lights ding )

08:38.208 --> 08:39.709
( horns honking )

08:39.750 --> 08:41.792
Our first crisis

08:39.750 --> 08:41.792
of the day!

08:41.834 --> 08:44.458
Uh, not counting the fire

08:41.834 --> 08:44.458
you started, sir?

08:44.500 --> 08:46.291
Not counting that.

08:46.333 --> 08:49.709
Our holographic traffic lights

08:46.333 --> 08:49.709
are on the fritz.

08:49.750 --> 08:53.333
But never fear, the Citizen

08:49.750 --> 08:53.333
Safety Board is here.

08:53.375 --> 08:58.000
And our own Mr. Harrison will

08:53.375 --> 08:58.000
direct traffic to keep up safe.

08:58.041 --> 08:59.709
Ready, Mr. Harrison?

08:59.750 --> 09:02.250
Just watch

08:59.750 --> 09:02.250
my hand signals.

09:06.959 --> 09:08.542
( bee buzzing )

09:09.583 --> 09:10.792
Shoo! Shoo!

09:10.834 --> 09:12.583
( horns honking )

09:12.625 --> 09:14.542
( drivers shouting )

09:14.583 --> 09:16.250
( cars crashing )

09:16.291 --> 09:19.000
( drivers shouting )

09:19.041 --> 09:21.750
Uh, sorry!

09:21.792 --> 09:25.125
(  adventurous theme playing  )

09:34.583 --> 09:36.667
Sure we have all the gear

09:34.583 --> 09:36.667
we need, Uncle Woodrow?

09:36.709 --> 09:39.250
Lantern, flares,

09:36.709 --> 09:39.250
cupcakes.

09:39.291 --> 09:40.792
Heh, heh.

09:39.291 --> 09:40.792
You name it.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.834
Cave looks

09:43.834 --> 09:45.834
pretty narrow.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.834
I'm not sure

09:45.875 --> 09:47.834
you'll fit inside, Blades.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.959
Oh, darn. I guess

09:47.875 --> 09:50.959
I'll have to stay outside.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.041
But I'll be thinking of you.

09:53.083 --> 09:56.000
(  mysterious theme playing  )

10:03.875 --> 10:06.417
( all grunt )

10:12.750 --> 10:14.875
DANI:

10:12.750 --> 10:14.875
We've been searching forever.

10:14.917 --> 10:18.125
WOODROW:

10:14.917 --> 10:18.125
This reminds me of

10:14.917 --> 10:18.125
the rock mazes of Iba Bunto.

10:18.166 --> 10:21.208
I spent hours

10:18.166 --> 10:21.208
finding my way out.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.291
So, what you're

10:21.250 --> 10:23.291
trying to say is...

10:23.333 --> 10:25.166
Yup, we're lost!

10:25.208 --> 10:26.625
DANI:

10:25.208 --> 10:26.625
Uncle Woodrow!

10:26.667 --> 10:28.333
WOODROW:

10:26.667 --> 10:28.333
We just took a few

10:26.667 --> 10:28.333
wrong turns.

10:28.375 --> 10:30.417
But this tunnel

10:28.375 --> 10:30.417
looks promising.

10:32.583 --> 10:34.166
( grunts )

10:34.208 --> 10:35.208
( all yelling )

10:35.333 --> 10:38.750
(  dramatic theme playing  )

10:42.542 --> 10:44.291
( all yelling )

10:46.709 --> 10:48.834
Oh, darn.

10:48.875 --> 10:51.375
I think I squashed

10:48.875 --> 10:51.375
the cupcakes.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.000
Everybody okay?

10:53.041 --> 10:55.166
Where are we?

10:56.709 --> 10:58.875
Blades? Blades, do you read?

10:56.709 --> 10:58.875
( static buzzing )

10:58.917 --> 11:01.875
Oh, the walls must be too thick

10:58.917 --> 11:01.875
for our signal to get out.

11:01.917 --> 11:04.458
We've been gone

11:01.917 --> 11:04.458
for a long time.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.417
I'm sure he

11:04.500 --> 11:06.417
went for help by now.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.041
( humming )

11:08.083 --> 11:09.667
( seagull squawking )

11:09.709 --> 11:13.083
I hope Dani and Cody are having

11:09.709 --> 11:13.083
as much fun as I am.

11:13.125 --> 11:15.834
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

11:15.875 --> 11:17.125
DANI:

11:15.875 --> 11:17.125
That's daylight!

11:17.166 --> 11:18.875
This must be

11:17.166 --> 11:18.875
the way out.

11:20.166 --> 11:22.834
I don't think we

11:20.166 --> 11:22.834
want out just yet.

11:24.834 --> 11:28.542
A skull and crossbones. Like the

11:24.834 --> 11:28.542
one on the portrait of Bertha.

11:28.583 --> 11:30.375
Do think this could be

11:28.583 --> 11:30.375
her lair?

11:30.417 --> 11:32.458
Cody, every pirate

11:30.417 --> 11:32.458
used this symbol.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.250
It doesn't prove anything.

11:34.291 --> 11:36.208
Besides, I don't even

11:34.291 --> 11:36.208
see any treasure.

11:36.250 --> 11:38.208
Shouldn't there be

11:36.250 --> 11:38.208
two of these?

11:38.250 --> 11:40.041
I mean, you can't have

11:40.083 --> 11:43.041
a crossbones

11:40.083 --> 11:43.041
with only one bone, right?

11:43.083 --> 11:46.208
Maybe Bertha's trying

11:43.083 --> 11:46.208
to tell us something!

11:46.250 --> 11:49.166
That if she was a pirate,

11:46.250 --> 11:49.166
she wasn't very good at it.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.291
Ah. Okay, just for

11:49.208 --> 11:51.291
the sake of argument,

11:51.333 --> 11:54.917
if the second bone was here,

11:51.333 --> 11:54.917
it would point this way.

11:56.834 --> 11:58.834
Whoa.

11:58.875 --> 12:00.166
Found something.

12:00.208 --> 12:02.458
A lever.

12:02.500 --> 12:06.750
(  mysterious theme playing  )

12:06.792 --> 12:08.875
( all gasp )

12:13.208 --> 12:14.583
CODY:

12:13.208 --> 12:14.583
Look, everybody!

12:21.375 --> 12:23.709
No way.

12:21.375 --> 12:23.709
Unbelievable!

12:23.750 --> 12:25.917
What's inside?

12:23.750 --> 12:25.917
Well, what do you know?

12:25.959 --> 12:27.583
There's a treasure

12:25.959 --> 12:27.583
after all.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.458
There's a chest.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.458
That's all we know for now.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.250
We haven't looked yet.

12:32.291 --> 12:36.083
We decided to save the big

12:32.291 --> 12:36.083
moment for everybody to share.

12:36.125 --> 12:37.917
Well, come on, open it!

12:37.959 --> 12:39.875
The suspense is killing me!

12:39.917 --> 12:41.709
Part of me

12:39.917 --> 12:41.709
hopes it's empty.

12:41.750 --> 12:45.208
Just to prove that maybe Bertha

12:41.750 --> 12:45.208
wasn't a pirate after all.

12:45.250 --> 12:48.458
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

12:49.542 --> 12:51.125
Oh, no.

12:52.959 --> 12:54.208
( sighs )

12:54.250 --> 12:55.625
So not-noble.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.500
Yeah, knew it.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.500
Too bad.

12:57.542 --> 13:00.250
Wait, Uncle Woodrow, look.

13:00.291 --> 13:02.583
There's something written

13:00.291 --> 13:02.583
on the inside of the chest.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.250
WOODROW:

13:02.625 --> 13:04.250
Another clue?

13:04.291 --> 13:07.583
"Only the last key will

13:04.291 --> 13:07.583
unlock the hidden treasure."

13:07.625 --> 13:10.291
Excellent.

13:07.625 --> 13:10.291
But are there instructions

13:10.333 --> 13:11.959
on where to find this key?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.375
Then it's a riddle.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.375
Hmm.

13:13.417 --> 13:17.000
Maybe, uh, a musical key?

13:13.417 --> 13:17.000
C-sharp?

13:17.041 --> 13:18.500
The last key.

13:18.542 --> 13:20.500
Key as in island?

13:20.542 --> 13:22.625
The farthest island

13:20.542 --> 13:22.625
of the Griffin Keys!

13:22.667 --> 13:25.083
That's where the treasure

13:22.667 --> 13:25.083
must be buried.

13:25.125 --> 13:29.125
Hmm, gotta admit,

13:25.125 --> 13:29.125
Bertha was one smart lady.

13:29.166 --> 13:33.959
Must run in the family.

13:29.166 --> 13:33.959
So intrigued now, Charlie?

13:34.041 --> 13:35.917
Care to go on

13:34.041 --> 13:35.917
an adventure?

13:35.959 --> 13:38.250
Sure. Beats sitting

13:35.959 --> 13:38.250
around doing nothing.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.000
We cannot all participate.

13:40.041 --> 13:41.500
It would be

13:40.041 --> 13:41.500
a violation of our oath

13:41.542 --> 13:43.375
to leave Griffin Rock

13:41.542 --> 13:43.375
unprotected.

13:43.417 --> 13:45.667
Griffin Rock doesn't want

13:43.417 --> 13:45.667
our protection.

13:45.709 --> 13:48.875
It's still our responsibility

13:45.709 --> 13:48.875
to keep an eye on things.

13:48.917 --> 13:51.792
Chase, you mind staying behind

13:48.917 --> 13:51.792
to watch the command center?

13:51.834 --> 13:53.333
With pleasure.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.333
And I will contact you

13:53.375 --> 13:55.125
if there is an emergency.

13:55.166 --> 13:56.542
Well, then, little brother,

13:56.583 --> 13:58.583
let's go find some answers.

13:58.625 --> 14:00.792

14:09.000 --> 14:11.625
BLADES:

14:09.000 --> 14:11.625
We should be singing

14:09.000 --> 14:11.625
sea shanties.

14:11.667 --> 14:14.375
Anybody know any?

14:11.667 --> 14:14.375
Besides "Yo-Ho-Ho."

14:14.417 --> 14:16.125
That one gets pretty old.

14:16.166 --> 14:19.625
What's so great about

14:16.166 --> 14:19.625
finding rusty old metal anyway?

14:19.667 --> 14:22.792
That rusty old metal

14:19.667 --> 14:22.792
is worth a fortune.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.834
Kade, we're not here

14:22.834 --> 14:24.834
to get rich.

14:24.875 --> 14:27.709
We're here to learn more

14:24.875 --> 14:27.709
about our family history.

14:27.750 --> 14:29.792
No. We're here to prove

14:27.750 --> 14:29.792
this treasure

14:29.834 --> 14:31.875
has nothing to do

14:29.834 --> 14:31.875
with our family history.

14:31.917 --> 14:34.875
That I-- We. --are not

14:31.917 --> 14:34.875
descended from pirates.

14:34.917 --> 14:38.041
Dani, whatever Bertha

14:34.917 --> 14:38.041
did or didn't do,

14:38.083 --> 14:40.083
it doesn't change

14:38.083 --> 14:40.083
who you are.

14:40.125 --> 14:41.375
Tell that to the mayor.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.917
Kade, maybe you should

14:42.875 --> 14:44.917
let Woodrow take the lead.

14:44.959 --> 14:46.917
He's had a bit more

14:44.959 --> 14:46.917
experience.

14:46.959 --> 14:49.208
Dad, I know what

14:46.959 --> 14:49.208
I'm doing.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.625
WOODROW:

14:52.000 --> 14:53.625
Be careful.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.834
These trees are

14:53.667 --> 14:55.834
perfect nesting places

15:09.959 --> 15:11.625
I can help with that.

Aah! Get away! My face! Aah!

15:18.542 --> 15:20.291

15:23.542 --> 15:25.709
Good thinking, Woodrow.

15:25.750 --> 15:29.500
Yeah, thanks.

15:25.750 --> 15:29.500
I think.

15:29.542 --> 15:31.333
Heh, heh.

15:29.542 --> 15:31.333
That was nothing

15:31.375 --> 15:33.917
compared to the giant

15:31.375 --> 15:33.917
hornets of Wapzilla.

15:33.959 --> 15:35.458
I ever tell you

15:33.959 --> 15:35.458
about those?

15:35.500 --> 15:37.375
ALL:

15:35.500 --> 15:37.375
Often.

15:37.417 --> 15:39.875
ALPER:

15:37.417 --> 15:39.875
Yes, ma'am.

15:37.417 --> 15:39.875
We know your son's kite

15:39.917 --> 15:41.500
has been stuck

15:39.917 --> 15:41.500
in that tree for hours.

15:41.542 --> 15:44.333
And the Citizen Safety Board

15:41.542 --> 15:44.333
will be there any minute.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.166
Or by Tuesday.

15:46.208 --> 15:48.875
No, sir, we can't look

15:46.208 --> 15:48.875
for your lost pet right now.

15:48.917 --> 15:50.750
Perhaps if you

15:48.917 --> 15:50.750
set out a saucer of...

15:50.792 --> 15:52.291
whatever pythons drink?

15:52.333 --> 15:55.041
Oh, this is a disaster.

15:55.083 --> 15:58.542
I should never have

15:55.083 --> 15:58.542
suspended the Burnses.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.917
But I'm a leader.

16:00.959 --> 16:04.000
I can't just flip-flop now,

16:00.959 --> 16:04.000
can I?

16:07.291 --> 16:09.625
Ah. More sand?

16:11.041 --> 16:12.792
Same palm trees.

16:12.834 --> 16:15.041
BOULDER:

16:12.834 --> 16:15.041
And no clues.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.458
DANI:

16:15.083 --> 16:16.458
Wait, look!

16:16.500 --> 16:18.250
X marks the spot.

16:18.291 --> 16:21.458
The palm trees are the clue.

16:18.291 --> 16:21.458
The treasure is up there.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.500
(  adventurous theme playing  )

16:26.041 --> 16:27.250
I hit something.

16:27.291 --> 16:28.625
Careful now.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.583
Whatever the treasure is,

16:30.250 --> 16:33.583
it's centuries old.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.375
We wouldn't want to damage

16:37.417 --> 16:40.458
this rotted piece of wood.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.083
( all groan )

16:43.875 --> 16:46.333
My timbers just unshivered.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.542
Maybe it's another clue?

16:48.583 --> 16:49.959
( groans )

16:50.000 --> 16:52.333
No, you were right again,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.333
Charlie.

16:52.375 --> 16:56.083
Another Woodrow Burns

16:52.375 --> 16:56.083
wild good chase.

16:56.125 --> 16:59.041
Looks like Bertha was just

16:56.125 --> 16:59.041
trying to fool everybody.

16:59.083 --> 17:00.291
Us included.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.917
I'm sorry, Woody.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.917
Really.

17:02.959 --> 17:04.542
But this can't be

17:02.959 --> 17:04.542
all there is.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.166
You said it yourself, Dad.

17:06.208 --> 17:07.834
Bertha was a smart lady.

17:07.875 --> 17:09.291
She wouldn't go

17:07.875 --> 17:09.291
to all this trouble--

17:09.333 --> 17:11.583
The map, the clues.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.583
--for nothing.

17:11.625 --> 17:14.208
We're judging things by what

17:11.625 --> 17:14.208
we've found on the surface.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.000
Just like the mayor

17:14.250 --> 17:16.000
judged us.

17:16.041 --> 17:18.333
Boulder, keep digging.

17:16.041 --> 17:18.333
Sure, Dani.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.625
You were right. This timber

17:22.083 --> 17:25.625
goes down pretty far.

17:25.667 --> 17:28.083
Wait, that's--

17:28.125 --> 17:29.792
The mast of a ship!

17:29.834 --> 17:32.959
Okay! Re-shiver me timbers!

17:33.000 --> 17:34.875
Argh!

17:34.917 --> 17:38.125
CODY:

17:34.917 --> 17:38.125
Now that's what

17:34.917 --> 17:38.125
I call a good hiding spot.

17:38.166 --> 17:41.583
How on earth did Bertha

17:38.166 --> 17:41.583
bury her entire ship?

17:41.625 --> 17:44.792
DANI:

17:41.625 --> 17:44.792
I'm beginning to think she could

17:41.625 --> 17:44.792
do anything she put her mind to.

17:47.625 --> 17:49.083
Whoa!

17:49.125 --> 17:50.959
Jackpot!

17:51.000 --> 17:53.750
You said it.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.750
Bertha's logbook!

17:53.792 --> 17:56.959
Uh, I was talking

17:53.792 --> 17:56.959
about the gold.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.250
Forget the gold!

17:59.291 --> 18:00.959
Here, Dani, read this.

18:02.500 --> 18:05.750
"I, Bertha Carnahan--"

18:02.500 --> 18:05.750
Carnahan?

18:05.792 --> 18:08.667
Her maiden name.

18:05.792 --> 18:08.667
Before she married Horace.

18:08.709 --> 18:13.125
"Hereby end my pirate career

18:08.709 --> 18:13.125
with my richest booty yet.

18:13.166 --> 18:15.333
The Guild Hall Charity Fund."

18:15.375 --> 18:17.625
Oh, so it's true.

18:15.375 --> 18:17.625
Keep reading!

18:17.667 --> 18:21.333
"I wish to start afresh in life

18:17.667 --> 18:21.333
as Mrs. Horace Burns.

18:21.375 --> 18:23.083
"But I cannot

18:21.375 --> 18:23.083
return the treasure

18:23.125 --> 18:25.417
"without revealing my identity.

18:25.458 --> 18:27.792
"While I would gladly accept

18:25.458 --> 18:27.792
my own punishment,

18:27.834 --> 18:31.125
"I cannot bring shame

18:27.834 --> 18:31.125
upon Horace and his family.

18:31.166 --> 18:34.166
"Thus, I bury

18:31.166 --> 18:34.166
this treasure here, hoping that

18:34.208 --> 18:36.417
"one day my descendants

18:34.208 --> 18:36.417
may find it,

18:36.458 --> 18:38.291
"and do what is honorable.

18:38.333 --> 18:42.166
What I do, I do for love."

18:42.208 --> 18:44.083
She really was a pirate.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.500
Exactly, "was."

18:45.542 --> 18:48.125
But she got a second

18:45.542 --> 18:48.125
chance and took it.

18:48.166 --> 18:50.667
Now it's up to us

18:48.166 --> 18:50.667
to do as she asked.

18:50.709 --> 18:52.208
What do we tell the mayor?

18:52.250 --> 18:54.542
I have a few ideas.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.041
( band plays fanfare )

18:56.083 --> 18:59.709
Welcome to Founders' Day,

18:56.083 --> 18:59.709
Part Two!

18:59.750 --> 19:01.583
Forget Founders' Day!

19:01.625 --> 19:04.375
What are you doing about that

19:01.625 --> 19:04.375
useless Citizen Safety Board?

19:04.417 --> 19:06.792
Milo, you're on that board!

19:06.834 --> 19:08.667
That's beside the point!

19:08.709 --> 19:11.125
We need the Burnses back!

19:11.166 --> 19:12.625
Bring back the Burnses!

19:12.667 --> 19:15.208
Bring back the Burnses!

19:12.667 --> 19:15.208
Everybody!

19:15.250 --> 19:18.083
ALL ( chanting ):

19:15.250 --> 19:18.083
Bring back the Burnses!

19:18.125 --> 19:19.750
DANI:

19:18.125 --> 19:19.750
I like the sound of that.

19:21.291 --> 19:22.834
Dani Burns!

19:22.875 --> 19:27.458
Your pirate clan are not

19:22.875 --> 19:27.458
invited to this celebration!

19:27.500 --> 19:30.750
You might want to

19:27.500 --> 19:30.750
reconsider.

19:30.792 --> 19:32.750
( crowd gasps )

19:33.917 --> 19:35.458
Gold doubloons.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.875
Enough to fix the damage

19:35.500 --> 19:37.875
from yesterday's fire.

19:37.917 --> 19:40.917
And any other damage

19:37.917 --> 19:40.917
caused by our suspension.

19:40.959 --> 19:43.834
Huxley Prescott on the scene

19:40.959 --> 19:43.834
with breaking news!

19:43.875 --> 19:48.083
Dani Burns, is this Bertha's

19:43.875 --> 19:48.083
lost treasure?

19:48.125 --> 19:50.208
Bertha's found treasure.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.333
And the rest of it

19:50.250 --> 19:52.333
will go to charity,

19:52.375 --> 19:53.917
as originally intended.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.542
I know it's

19:53.959 --> 19:55.542
the right thing to do,

19:55.583 --> 19:57.208
but that part

19:55.583 --> 19:57.208
kind of hurts.

19:59.041 --> 20:01.000
And we found her pirate ship.

20:01.041 --> 20:02.542
That will go to the museum.

20:02.583 --> 20:05.625
Aw, we're giving away

20:02.583 --> 20:05.625
that too?

20:05.667 --> 20:07.083
I wanted to keep it.

20:07.125 --> 20:09.542
None of that

20:07.125 --> 20:09.542
changes the fact

20:09.583 --> 20:12.166
that your ancestor

20:09.583 --> 20:12.166
was a pirate!

20:12.208 --> 20:15.208
Ah, but she gave up

20:12.208 --> 20:15.208
the pirate life

20:15.250 --> 20:17.667
when she fell in love

20:15.250 --> 20:17.667
with Horace Burns.

20:17.709 --> 20:19.583
The proof is here.

20:19.625 --> 20:21.417
But that

20:19.625 --> 20:21.417
doesn't even matter.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.875
It doesn't?

20:21.458 --> 20:23.875
No.

20:23.917 --> 20:26.542
Because people should

20:23.917 --> 20:26.542
be judged for what they do.

20:26.583 --> 20:29.542
Not their family or their

20:26.583 --> 20:29.542
friends or anybody else.

20:29.583 --> 20:31.709
And that's true whether

20:29.583 --> 20:31.709
they're pirates, police

20:31.750 --> 20:33.917
or even politicians.

20:35.375 --> 20:38.709
Well, in that case,

20:38.750 --> 20:41.458
welcome back, Burnses!

20:41.500 --> 20:43.792
( all cheering )

20:43.834 --> 20:46.834
Here, chief. These are

20:43.834 --> 20:46.834
your problems now.

20:46.875 --> 20:49.917
Uh, you may want to deal

20:46.875 --> 20:49.917
with the python first.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.125
Hey, Dani, could you

20:52.375 --> 20:54.125
come to school

20:54.166 --> 20:56.041
and repeat that

20:54.166 --> 20:56.041
speech to Mrs. Murphy?

20:56.083 --> 20:59.750
Aw, sure, Cody.

20:56.083 --> 20:59.750
And we'll bring Kade.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.625
Me with Mrs. Murphy?

21:01.667 --> 21:03.417
She'll give me

21:01.667 --> 21:03.417
detention for life!

21:03.458 --> 21:05.542
I want to go back

21:03.458 --> 21:05.542
to the firehouse.

21:05.583 --> 21:08.709
We need to find that closet

21:05.583 --> 21:08.709
and get rid of the skeleton.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.583
I think we just did,

21:08.750 --> 21:10.583
buddy.

21:10.625 --> 21:12.375
So, Uncle Woodrow,

21:12.417 --> 21:14.709
does the logbook say how

21:12.417 --> 21:14.709
Bertha and Horace met?

21:14.750 --> 21:16.208
Or how they

21:14.750 --> 21:16.208
fell in love?

21:16.250 --> 21:17.917
No.

21:17.959 --> 21:21.166
Clearly there's

21:17.959 --> 21:21.166
more to this story.

21:21.208 --> 21:22.959
Who's up for the library?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.417
No, thanks.

21:24.458 --> 21:26.000
I need to clean

21:24.458 --> 21:26.000
the toaster.

21:26.041 --> 21:27.750
Once a year's

21:26.041 --> 21:27.750
my limit.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.542
(  suspenseful theme playing  )
