WEBVTT

00:00.056 --> 00:01.634
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.789 --> 00:03.989
Callie is into me. We
kissed at the wedding.

00:03.991 --> 00:05.491
And that's why she ran away with Wyatt,

00:05.592 --> 00:07.026
because she didn't want
to mess up Jude's adoption.

00:07.128 --> 00:08.628
The only reason we're
not together right now

00:08.729 --> 00:10.930
is because she needs a
family more than a boyfriend.

00:11.031 --> 00:13.404
- I don't belong here.
- Anyone else feel they don't belong here?

00:13.439 --> 00:14.773
I've terminated my rights

00:14.874 --> 00:16.075
so you guys can get adopted now.

00:16.175 --> 00:17.910
I want to be a part of this family

00:18.011 --> 00:20.079
more than I have ever wanted
anything in my whole life.

00:20.180 --> 00:21.747
She's over me.

00:21.848 --> 00:25.117
Sucks about Callie. You deserve better.

00:25.218 --> 00:27.986
I want to go back on my
meds. Can we start over?

00:28.088 --> 00:30.723
- We are trying to have a baby.
- Oh, my God. A baby?

00:30.824 --> 00:33.725
Maybe we should... ask Timothy.

00:33.826 --> 00:34.792
So you read the donor contract?

00:34.893 --> 00:36.894
I don't think I can sign it.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.596
Should have never inseminated
before we signed that contract.

00:38.697 --> 00:40.331
- I'm pregnant.
- Oh, my God.

00:40.432 --> 00:42.499
You bribed him?

00:42.601 --> 00:43.801
I just wanted to make sure
Dad didn't go to prison.

00:43.902 --> 00:46.204
For $10,000.

00:46.304 --> 00:47.638
What's to stop her from
going to the DA anyway?

00:47.740 --> 00:48.606
Freakin' woman, I could kill her.

00:48.707 --> 00:50.574
You haven't seen Ana, have you?

00:50.675 --> 00:52.443
They saw her get into a
screaming match with some guy.

00:52.544 --> 00:55.346
I just got a message, and
he sounded super drunk.

00:55.447 --> 00:57.314
Donald isn't my dad?

00:57.415 --> 00:58.515
According to the birth certificate,

00:58.617 --> 01:00.651
it says Robert Quinn.

01:00.753 --> 01:02.919
You're going to walk into that courtroom,

01:03.020 --> 01:06.022
and officially become
a member of this family.

01:06.124 --> 01:07.357
If you're not going to
be able to get adopted,

01:07.458 --> 01:09.425
does that change anything?

01:09.456 --> 01:11.892
No, it doesn't change anything.

01:11.993 --> 01:13.994
- What happened with the audition for the symphony?
- I got it.

01:14.095 --> 01:16.063
All I have to do is
tell them you set her up,

01:16.164 --> 01:17.698
- because I bought back the IDs.
- What IDs?

01:17.799 --> 01:19.566
The kids we sold to aren't going to talk.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.101
I told you I was going
to hit you where it hurt.

Spaghetti and potato chips for breakfast?

03:33.997 --> 03:35.498
The baby wants it, Jude. The baby wants it.

03:37.835 --> 03:40.203
- How's it feel?
- Pretty good.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.603
Hopefully we'll be done with
that thing after today, right?

03:43.240 --> 03:44.740
Where's Mariana?

03:44.842 --> 03:45.808
We were supposed to
walk to school together.

03:45.909 --> 03:48.610
- She already left.
- Whatever.

03:48.712 --> 03:50.512
- Peace out.
- Peace out.

03:50.613 --> 03:53.049
Ooh!  Look at this.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.984
- Is that... ?
- Your birth certificate?

03:55.025 --> 03:57.493
- Yes, it is! It is indeed!
- Go show Mama.

03:57.594 --> 04:00.029
Oh, let me see! Let me see!

04:00.130 --> 04:01.297
Oh! Your hands.

04:01.398 --> 04:04.432
Let me see that.

04:04.533 --> 04:08.236
Oh, Jude. This is so great.

04:08.337 --> 04:10.438
So great. Oh!

04:10.539 --> 04:13.574
- I just love you so much.
- I love you, too.

04:13.676 --> 04:14.943
- That's awesome, bud.
- What is?

04:15.044 --> 04:16.077
I got my birth certificate.

04:18.113 --> 04:21.716
Oh, my God! That's amazing!

04:21.817 --> 04:23.952
All right, you guys. Let's get to court.

04:24.053 --> 04:25.187
I will pick you up for your
doctor's appointment after lunch.

04:25.288 --> 04:27.355
Got it.

04:27.456 --> 04:31.793
Listen, please do not worry.
You'll get a home run. Ok?

04:34.262 --> 04:37.164
Ooh! Ok, let's get out of here!

04:39.735 --> 04:41.536
Sorry to ambush you like this.

04:41.637 --> 04:44.806
Your dad asked me to move in.

04:44.906 --> 04:46.641
You're moving in with him?

04:46.742 --> 04:50.311
Because I'm in love with
him, and he's in love with me.

04:50.412 --> 04:52.880
You're in love with him?
You're not even faithful to him.

04:52.981 --> 04:56.650
Wow.

04:56.751 --> 04:59.019
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.488
And you're keeping all
sorts of secrets from him.

05:01.589 --> 05:03.824
I keep secrets from him because I love him.

05:03.925 --> 05:04.925
He couldn't handle it, Brandon.

05:06.627 --> 05:10.464
Look, I never told you this...

05:10.565 --> 05:13.500
but that night...

05:13.601 --> 05:16.336
the night that your dad found out
about everything you'd been up to...

05:16.437 --> 05:19.806
when I found him, he
was in really bad shape.

05:19.907 --> 05:22.141
He could barely talk he was so drunk.

05:22.243 --> 05:23.677
He had been in some sort of fight.

05:23.778 --> 05:25.912
He had blood all over his hands.

05:26.013 --> 05:26.513
He had blood on his hands?

05:29.884 --> 05:33.119
Look, I'm not telling you this
because I want you to feel bad,

05:33.220 --> 05:36.622
I just want you to know how
hard he took all of that.

05:36.723 --> 05:40.260
So before you get any ideas
about coming clean with him,

05:40.361 --> 05:42.362
just think about what it would do
to him if he found out that we...

05:42.462 --> 05:44.597
I mean, he could drink again,

05:44.698 --> 05:47.300
or he could hurt someone, or
worse, he could hurt himself.

05:47.401 --> 05:50.937
Your dad needs me, and he needs you.

05:51.038 --> 05:53.739
So you got to get over what happened...

05:53.840 --> 05:54.907
and just let it go.

06:12.325 --> 06:14.659
So you are not Ms. Jacob's birth father?

06:16.329 --> 06:17.062
No.

06:19.398 --> 06:23.167
When I met your mom, you
were about six months old.

06:23.268 --> 06:26.971
And she was with some...

06:27.072 --> 06:30.408
she was married to some guy named
Robert Quinn for a little while.

06:30.509 --> 06:33.878
But...

06:33.979 --> 06:36.448
when he found out she
was pregnant, he left.

06:36.549 --> 06:41.319
Callie, you gotta understand that...

06:41.420 --> 06:45.056
the first time that I held
you, I felt like you were mine.

06:45.157 --> 06:47.224
And by the time you were
finally old enough to understand,

06:47.326 --> 06:48.860
it just seemed silly to
try to explain it to you.

06:48.961 --> 06:50.795
I mean, you were my
daughter. That was that.

06:54.899 --> 06:56.733
I mean, what is a father, anyways?

06:56.835 --> 06:59.169
Is it the guy who got
your mom pregnant and left?

06:59.270 --> 07:01.605
Or is it the guy who
changed your diapers...

07:01.706 --> 07:04.341
and held her when she was sick?

07:04.442 --> 07:06.643
I was there for her first
words and her first steps.

07:08.312 --> 07:09.713
Thank you.

07:19.491 --> 07:23.293
I appreciate that Donald did
raise Callie until the age of ten,

07:23.394 --> 07:27.964
and that certainly makes a strong case
for his being her presumptive father,

07:28.065 --> 07:32.002
and therefore being able to
terminate parental rights.

07:32.103 --> 07:36.939
But because Robert Quinn
was married to Callie's mom,

07:37.041 --> 07:41.444
and because his name is on
her official birth certificate,

07:41.545 --> 07:44.580
yet he never signed it.

07:44.681 --> 07:48.051
It's possible he never knew about her

07:48.152 --> 07:52.688
and did not, in fact,
knowingly abandon her as a baby.

07:52.789 --> 07:53.789
So he needs to be
notified about all of this.

07:57.895 --> 07:58.761
I know it's frustrating...

08:01.565 --> 08:06.602
... but until there is signed
consent from Robert Quinn,

08:06.703 --> 08:11.240
the adoption of Callie Jacob by
Stefanie and Lena Adams Foster is denied.

08:24.183 --> 08:27.052
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

08:27.153 --> 08:28.553
I'm looking for Brandon
Foster, please. I'm his mother.

08:28.655 --> 08:29.521
He's right this way.

08:35.828 --> 08:37.929
Hey? Hey?

08:38.030 --> 08:41.667
Mama's here. I'm here, ok?

08:41.768 --> 08:44.335
He was beaten up pretty good, but the
CT didn't show any internal bleeding

08:44.436 --> 08:46.037
or swelling in the brain.

08:46.138 --> 08:48.438
Ok, what happened to his hand?

08:48.540 --> 08:50.975
Well, that's our biggest concern.

08:51.076 --> 08:54.211
He has compound fractures. The bones
are shattered in several places.

08:54.312 --> 08:54.945
He's going to need surgery.

08:55.047 --> 08:58.015
Shattered?

08:58.116 --> 09:00.818
He's a pianist.

09:00.919 --> 09:02.787
He just got into the junior symphony.

09:02.888 --> 09:05.189
Our concern right now is making
sure he can still use it at all.

09:05.290 --> 09:06.256
I've got an orthopedic surgeon on her way.

09:07.793 --> 09:08.826
Uh, thank you.

09:10.295 --> 09:11.428
He's gonna be ok.

09:14.199 --> 09:17.801
Baby, hey.

09:17.902 --> 09:20.269
Who did this to you? Who did this?

09:23.607 --> 09:24.574
Vico.

09:33.350 --> 09:35.218
Ok, thumbs and pinky together.

09:35.319 --> 09:38.121
And resist, good. Relax.

09:38.222 --> 09:40.556
How's the feeling? Any tingling, numbness?

09:40.657 --> 09:43.359
A little, but that'll go away, right?

09:43.460 --> 09:46.395
Hopefully. I mean, we could operate again

09:46.496 --> 09:49.365
but any remaining nerve damage
is going to be hard to repair,

09:49.466 --> 09:51.133
and could potentially
just make things worse.

09:51.234 --> 09:53.602
But the bones are nicely healed.

09:53.703 --> 09:56.071
You've got between 90
and 95 percent function.

09:56.172 --> 09:58.707
I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

09:58.808 --> 09:59.875
Good, he'll be able to
play the piano again?

09:59.976 --> 10:00.776
Like he used to, right?

10:00.877 --> 10:02.577
We hope so, yes.

10:02.678 --> 10:03.445
But we won't know until he tries.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.167
Damn, yo. Heinz 57's looking good today.

10:26.269 --> 10:28.303
Heinz 57?

10:28.404 --> 10:30.372
Yeah, you know that stuff you put on meat?

10:30.473 --> 10:32.006
Well, I want to put some of that on mine.

10:32.107 --> 10:33.174
Nice.

10:34.810 --> 10:37.379
Hey, babe. What's up?

10:37.480 --> 10:38.992
Hayley's shorts, from the looks of it.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.218
No kissing at practice.

10:55.730 --> 10:58.132
This is nuts. We're gonna
have to do this every day?

10:58.233 --> 11:00.668
I'm sorry, but we cannot afford
the lease on the big gym anymore.

11:00.769 --> 11:03.171
Great, just great.

11:03.272 --> 11:05.472
Look, we have lost some major donors,

11:05.573 --> 11:07.374
and so until we can replace that revenue,

11:07.475 --> 11:08.509
we're just going to have to learn to share.

11:08.610 --> 11:10.944
Or if you prefer, we could always...

11:11.045 --> 11:13.880
cut the wrestling program altogether.

11:13.981 --> 11:14.515
I didn't think so.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.521
When are they starting the
search for the new principal?

11:20.622 --> 11:23.557
I don't know, but until then,
well, you're stuck with me.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.361
Have a good practice.

11:37.872 --> 11:41.241
Guys, come on. It's our turn.

11:41.342 --> 11:43.476
Hey, man. A bunch of us are going
to play paintball on Saturday.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.011
You want to come?

11:45.112 --> 11:46.980
Uh, just us guys, though. Ok?

11:47.081 --> 11:50.750
Yeah, cool. Sounds good.

11:50.852 --> 11:53.820
Oh, by the way, thank you so much
for helping me out with that end kick.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.722
I just could not figure that out.

11:55.823 --> 11:57.924
No problem.

11:58.025 --> 11:58.991
I just... I really want
to get it right, you know?

11:59.092 --> 12:00.259
Don't worry, you're doing great.

12:00.361 --> 12:01.126
Really? I am?

12:02.896 --> 12:04.430
You're getting a lot better...

12:04.531 --> 12:06.065
Oh, my God, thanks.

12:06.166 --> 12:08.267
Hey, by the way, your roots are showing.

12:08.369 --> 12:10.770
It's probably time for a touch-up.

12:10.871 --> 12:13.272
Oh! Yeah, I was... I'm
going to do that tonight.

12:13.374 --> 12:14.139
Cool.

12:15.676 --> 12:17.877
- Hey.
- Hey!

12:17.978 --> 12:19.612
How'd it go today? Doctor, right?

12:19.713 --> 12:22.014
Yeah, you know, as good
as could be hoped, I guess.

12:22.115 --> 12:25.150
Said Brandon's got about
95 percent function back

12:25.252 --> 12:27.719
and should be playing the
piano again before long.

12:27.820 --> 12:29.955
- So that good, right?
- Yeah, absolutely.

12:30.056 --> 12:32.491
Good, good.

12:32.592 --> 12:34.459
I mean, I'd asked him myself,

12:34.560 --> 12:36.061
but he barely picks up
the phone for me anymore.

12:36.162 --> 12:38.430
Yeah? And why's that?

12:38.531 --> 12:40.099
I don't know.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.935
He probably... thinks I let him down again.

12:43.036 --> 12:44.469
I mean, he did get beat up
right outside my place, Stef.

12:44.570 --> 12:45.871
What are you talking about?

12:45.971 --> 12:47.972
You didn't know he was coming over.

12:48.073 --> 12:51.443
You can't seriously blame yourself
for being asleep, Mike. Come on.

12:51.544 --> 12:53.945
Hey, Foster.

12:54.046 --> 12:55.296
No one on 17th has seen her.

12:56.116 --> 12:59.518
- Ok, thanks. I appreciate you asking around for me.
- Sure thing.

13:01.954 --> 13:03.522
What are you doing? Why
are you looking for Ana?

13:03.623 --> 13:05.624
It makes me nervous,
not knowing where she is.

13:05.725 --> 13:07.792
I don't want her showing up out of nowhere,

13:07.893 --> 13:09.394
getting in touch with the
twins or Brandon or something.

13:09.494 --> 13:10.962
After what happened last time,

13:11.063 --> 13:12.263
I just want to know where she is, ok?

13:12.364 --> 13:16.100
No, Stef. No, it's not ok.

13:16.201 --> 13:18.369
I mean, she's gone.

13:18.470 --> 13:21.039
Just, can't you leave well enough alone?

13:21.140 --> 13:22.840
Do you really want to invite
that mess back into our lives?

13:26.111 --> 13:28.379
And what if Captain Roberts or the
DA find out you're looking for her?

13:28.480 --> 13:29.380
Don't you think it's going
to look a little suspicious?

13:29.481 --> 13:30.181
They're not going to find out.

13:30.282 --> 13:33.717
How do you know?

13:33.819 --> 13:35.118
Just leave it alone, Stef,
ok? Just leave it alone.

14:01.233 --> 14:04.503
So? You all cleared to play again?

14:04.604 --> 14:08.306
Yeah, yeah. They say
I'm close to 100 percent.

14:08.407 --> 14:10.676
That's great.

14:10.777 --> 14:13.345
Yeah, I was worried things
weren't going to work out

14:13.446 --> 14:15.447
when I came to see you in the hospital.

14:15.547 --> 14:18.083
How about you? How was everything at court?

14:18.184 --> 14:20.485
We all cleared for take off?

14:20.586 --> 14:24.689
Uh, no. We're not, yet.

14:24.790 --> 14:27.392
Yeah, they won't let me get
adopted until we find Robert Quinn

14:27.493 --> 14:28.659
or until I turn 18.

14:28.760 --> 14:29.927
What? You're kidding?

14:32.365 --> 14:33.965
Uh, are you going to look for him then?

14:34.066 --> 14:38.503
No, I don't think so.

14:38.604 --> 14:42.407
Eighteen's not that far away, and
it's just a piece of paper, right?

14:42.508 --> 14:44.575
I'm already a member of the family.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.778
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

14:47.880 --> 14:51.181
So we wait a couple years, then
we won't need anyone's permission.

14:53.919 --> 14:55.052
Right.

15:00.025 --> 15:02.292
Oh, crap. Wyatt's going
to be here like any second.

15:02.394 --> 15:04.529
I got to change. Can you...

15:04.630 --> 15:05.997
- Would you mind letting him in?
- Yeah, sure.

15:15.106 --> 15:16.507
- Come on in.
- Hey.

15:22.079 --> 15:23.446
So how's the hand?

15:23.548 --> 15:26.883
Oh, good as new.

15:26.984 --> 15:28.484
At least that's what
they're telling me, so...

15:28.586 --> 15:29.553
Yeah.

15:31.088 --> 15:33.657
Um, Callie's changing.

15:34.926 --> 15:38.862
Cool, thanks.

15:38.963 --> 15:42.566
Sorry about that stupid
judge. How'd Jude take it?

15:42.667 --> 15:45.769
He was pretty upset,

15:45.870 --> 15:47.671
but he definitely understands why I
don't want to find this Robert guy.

15:47.772 --> 15:51.507
He does? I'm not sure I do.

15:51.608 --> 15:55.845
Look, there's got to be a reason my
mom didn't want me to know about him.

15:56.947 --> 16:00.005
And I'm not sure I can
handle any more surprises.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.318
I think I've had enough of
those for like ten lifetimes.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.487
I feel you, girl.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.056
I just don't think I
can open up another door,

16:07.158 --> 16:10.126
without knowing what's behind it.

16:10.227 --> 16:12.595
For once, I just want to... play it safe.

16:12.696 --> 16:13.496
Daphne, you got a customer.

16:16.767 --> 16:20.035
Hey.

16:20.136 --> 16:21.870
- You sure you're ok?
- Yeah.

16:21.971 --> 16:24.373
- You sure?
- Yeah.

16:24.474 --> 16:26.875
Would you be better if I kissed you?

16:26.976 --> 16:29.912
- That's cheesy!
- But would you?

16:31.815 --> 16:32.548
Totally.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.523
Oh come on, y'all. People
tryin' to eat around here.

16:41.624 --> 16:44.693
Ok, since the math midterm is next week,

16:44.794 --> 16:47.028
I think we probably need
an extra tutoring session.

16:47.129 --> 16:48.730
Yeah, probably.

16:48.831 --> 16:51.766
- Or two, maybe?
- Yeah, sure.

16:51.867 --> 16:53.201
What about Saturday? Can you do that?

16:55.371 --> 16:57.605
Um, I actually have plans this Saturday.

16:57.707 --> 16:59.173
You do?

17:01.076 --> 17:03.578
We've got like a family thing.

17:03.679 --> 17:05.646
Oh, ok.

17:05.747 --> 17:08.549
Well then we should probably
study some more tonight.

17:08.650 --> 17:10.084
I have to go home for dinner,
but I'll come back later.

17:10.185 --> 17:11.986
- Ok.
- Ok.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.795
Mariana, let's go. Dinner's
ready, everyone's waiting.

17:21.896 --> 17:24.798
Ok, I'll just be a few minutes.
You guys can start without me.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.733
Are you ok? You're not sick, are you?

17:29.671 --> 17:32.006
- No, no, I'm just...
- I can see.

17:32.107 --> 17:34.909
Sweetheart, is it really worth it?

17:35.010 --> 17:37.610
Oh, my gosh, you are so beautiful.

17:37.711 --> 17:39.445
Why do you need to do all of this?

17:39.546 --> 17:41.248
You know you spend hours and hours on it,

17:41.349 --> 17:44.317
and you're just damaging your hair, love.

17:44.418 --> 17:46.953
- Mariana, I miss your old hair.
- Ok, well, I don't.

17:47.054 --> 17:49.055
- Really?
- Really, I like it blonde.

17:51.792 --> 17:53.159
How about if we took you to a salon,
and they got it back to brown...

17:53.261 --> 17:55.929
No!

17:56.030 --> 17:57.730
Be down for dinner in three minutes,
or I'm going to shave your head.

18:02.270 --> 18:04.938
Hey, I think we have to lay down
the law with Mariana. This is it.

18:05.039 --> 18:09.308
She is completely obsessed with her
hair, and she's absolutely ruining it.

18:09.410 --> 18:11.778
I think we need to tell her that she's
going to go back to brown, and that's it.

18:11.879 --> 18:14.246
Honey, we can't do that.

18:14.347 --> 18:17.349
Why not? She'll get mad, and she'll
get over it. What's she gonna do?

18:17.451 --> 18:19.652
She's not going to just get
over it. Not the way you think.

18:19.753 --> 18:22.054
It's hair, come on.

18:22.155 --> 18:24.690
Honey, to you it's hair.

18:24.792 --> 18:26.158
To me and to Mariana, it's
more complicated than that.

18:26.259 --> 18:28.861
Listen.

18:28.962 --> 18:31.063
When I was a teenager,

18:31.164 --> 18:33.732
I would've given anything to
have straight hair and I did.

18:33.833 --> 18:37.669
I spent every last dime
that I had, and then some,

18:37.770 --> 18:41.907
on chemicals and hot irons and Frizz Ease.

18:42.008 --> 18:44.509
Drove my mother crazy
because she loved my curls,

18:44.610 --> 18:46.812
and she would try and
try to force me to stop.

18:46.913 --> 18:50.950
But the more she dug in, the more I dug in.

18:51.051 --> 18:53.618
You know, I... I ended up
barely speaking to my mother

18:53.719 --> 18:55.321
for the better part of my junior year,

18:55.422 --> 18:57.522
because it was that important to me.

18:57.623 --> 19:00.125
Honey, you got to trust me on this, ok?

19:00.226 --> 19:02.361
- Ok.
- Thank you.

19:02.462 --> 19:04.096
And for the record, I love your curly hair.

19:04.197 --> 19:04.763
Thank you.

19:08.167 --> 19:09.633
Oh, speak of the devil.

19:09.734 --> 19:11.635
Hello, miss thing, nice of you to join us.

19:11.736 --> 19:13.738
Come on, you guys!
Everybody, it's dinner time!

19:17.876 --> 19:21.145
Well, this is very nice,
having everyone together.

19:21.246 --> 19:23.181
Yeah, I think we need to have more...

19:23.282 --> 19:24.682
- ... of these all-family dinners again.
- I'll get it.

19:24.783 --> 19:27.685
Can we make a deal that everyone is home

19:27.786 --> 19:30.154
for Tuesdays and Thursdays and Sundays?

19:30.255 --> 19:31.455
Oh, and don't forget, you guys.

19:31.555 --> 19:34.824
Tomorrow, we have Jude's award ceremony.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.093
You guys don't have to come.

19:36.194 --> 19:38.395
I'm just reading my dumb essay.

19:38.496 --> 19:39.829
Dude, we're coming.

19:39.930 --> 19:41.664
And excuse me, this is not a dumb essay,

19:41.765 --> 19:43.200
it is your award-winning essay...

19:43.301 --> 19:44.968
Um, there's a social worker at the door.

19:52.010 --> 19:54.844
Hi, can we help you?

19:54.945 --> 19:57.047
Hi, there. I'm Elaine with CDSS.

19:57.148 --> 20:01.083
Hi, I'm Lena, and this
is Stef. What's going on?

20:01.184 --> 20:03.185
Well, I'm afraid it's come to our attention
that your license to foster has expired.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.654
What?

20:05.755 --> 20:09.058
Expired? We weren't notified of anything.

20:09.159 --> 20:12.395
We had been told that you were formalizing
and Callie and Jude's adoptions,

20:12.496 --> 20:14.363
and then this afternoon
we received notification

20:14.464 --> 20:16.065
that Callie's adoption has been denied?

20:16.166 --> 20:18.234
Well, yes. For now, but...

20:18.335 --> 20:20.503
Well, unfortunately, without
a formalized adoption,

20:20.603 --> 20:23.639
and without a current license to foster,

20:23.740 --> 20:25.641
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have
to take Callie from the home.

20:33.596 --> 20:35.997
How could they do this?

20:36.098 --> 20:37.532
'Cause they can. This is how it works.

20:37.633 --> 20:39.935
I know, but...

20:40.036 --> 20:44.504
Honey, I am so sorry. I can't
believe this. It's just so wrong.

20:44.606 --> 20:46.506
We thought the adoption
would be long over by now.

20:46.608 --> 20:49.643
- No, it's ok.
- It's not.

20:49.744 --> 20:52.546
But I promise you, tomorrow, we will get
an emergency extension from the judge,

20:52.647 --> 20:54.747
and you will be back in
your bed tomorrow night.

20:59.387 --> 21:02.623
There's nothing you can do? You
can't cut us just a little slack here?

21:02.724 --> 21:04.925
I'm sorry. I could lose my job.

21:06.595 --> 21:07.661
Ok, you ready?

21:09.530 --> 21:11.131
Where's Jude?

21:11.232 --> 21:16.002
Uh, Jude, what are
you... what are you doing?

21:16.103 --> 21:17.770
I'm going with Callie.

21:17.871 --> 21:22.041
Oh, Jude, you don't have to do that.

21:22.142 --> 21:23.710
You're adopted, it's all fine now.

21:23.811 --> 21:26.613
I know. I want to.

21:26.714 --> 21:29.248
Jude, sweetheart.

21:29.349 --> 21:33.452
You're no longer a ward of the
state, so you... you can't go.

21:33.553 --> 21:37.824
Hey, listen to me. It's going to be fine.

21:37.925 --> 21:40.026
I'm going to be fine.

21:40.127 --> 21:42.528
I'm going to be back before you know it,

21:42.630 --> 21:45.498
in plenty of time for your big
speech at school tomorrow night.

21:45.599 --> 21:46.666
So there's nothing to worry about, ok?

21:46.767 --> 21:49.102
Ok?

21:49.202 --> 21:50.169
Ok.

21:50.270 --> 21:51.370
Ok.

21:56.143 --> 21:58.511
I got that.

21:58.612 --> 22:00.479
I'm so sorry about all this.

22:06.819 --> 22:09.921
Right?

22:10.023 --> 22:15.461
And that's negative three,
so... what's the root?

22:15.562 --> 22:18.797
There's no family thing on Saturday. I'm
going to play paintball with the guys.

22:18.898 --> 22:21.033
I see.

22:25.171 --> 22:26.872
- What guys?
- From the wrestling team.

22:28.207 --> 22:31.143
Ok.

22:31.243 --> 22:34.780
- Are you upset?
- No.

22:34.881 --> 22:38.650
I mean, I wish you
didn't lie to me about it,

22:38.751 --> 22:42.020
but you know, whatever.

22:42.121 --> 22:45.090
I'm really sorry about that.
This won't happen again.

22:48.227 --> 22:50.162
You're not mad?

22:50.262 --> 22:54.432
I'm not mad.

22:54.533 --> 22:58.636
It kind of sucks, but I'm not mad.

22:58.738 --> 23:03.842
Look, ever since you and
I started dating, well,

23:03.943 --> 23:07.511
I went from being one of the
guys to Jesus's girlfriend.

23:07.612 --> 23:10.081
- You're not just my girlfriend.
- It bites.

23:10.182 --> 23:13.417
It's just...

23:13.468 --> 23:15.836
I don't know. Everything's kind of changed.

23:15.937 --> 23:21.575
I know it's stupid, but I feel
like I lost all my friends.

23:21.677 --> 23:25.112
And you know I don't hang out with girls,

23:25.213 --> 23:30.151
and now that the guys are
treating me like a girl, well...

23:30.251 --> 23:31.385
It just sucks.

23:38.259 --> 23:42.195
So how many homes you been in?

23:42.296 --> 23:44.530
Foster homes, I mean.

23:44.631 --> 23:48.868
Oh, um, six, I think? Yeah.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.269
Seven, if you count this one.

23:50.370 --> 23:54.507
- In how long?
- About six years.

23:54.608 --> 23:56.810
One a year, huh? That's too many.

23:56.911 --> 23:59.612
Sorry about that. That's gotta be hard.

23:59.714 --> 24:00.980
Not hungry?

24:03.884 --> 24:07.620
That's ok. It's pretty bad anyway.

24:07.722 --> 24:08.722
How about some dessert? I made cookies.

24:37.451 --> 24:38.317
Hey.

24:41.355 --> 24:46.359
Um, I was just... going over
it, you know, before I...

24:46.460 --> 24:47.993
Hey, it's going to be ok.

24:48.094 --> 24:49.828
You may be a little out of practice,

24:49.929 --> 24:51.163
but you'll be back to 100
percent before you know it.

24:51.265 --> 24:54.600
I know. I'm ok, Mom.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.268
I just wanted to say
goodnight, and I love you.

24:56.369 --> 24:57.702
And call your dad, please, he misses you.

25:01.707 --> 25:03.942
Uh, did he tell you...

25:04.043 --> 25:06.111
that Dani's moving in with him?

25:08.815 --> 25:13.485
Danni's moving in?  No, he didn't.

25:13.586 --> 25:15.854
It's his life,

25:15.955 --> 25:17.355
though I still don't understand
why he didn't break up with her,

25:17.456 --> 25:20.659
but that's... none of my business, right?

25:20.760 --> 25:24.997
He did. The night, you
know, the night of the dance.

25:25.098 --> 25:28.566
But then I guess he went
out and got a little drunk...

25:28.668 --> 25:30.068
... pretty loaded, actually,

25:30.170 --> 25:31.904
and I didn't know what to do,

25:32.005 --> 25:36.107
so I...

25:36.208 --> 25:39.811
... told Dani, and she
went out and found him.

25:39.912 --> 25:41.813
- Why didn't you call me?
- Why do you think, Mom?

25:46.251 --> 25:50.254
So, yeah, um...

25:50.355 --> 25:53.657
he was all messed up.

25:53.758 --> 25:56.560
He'd been in like a bar fight or something,

25:56.661 --> 25:59.596
and Dani went out, found
him, cleaned him up,

25:59.698 --> 26:03.134
and he's I guess been sober ever since.

26:03.235 --> 26:06.537
So you know now he feels like
he can't stay clean without her.

26:06.638 --> 26:09.673
He was in a fight? What happened?

26:09.774 --> 26:14.311
I don't know. He had like
blood on his hands, I guess.

26:14.411 --> 26:19.649
But that's not really the point, Mom.

26:19.750 --> 26:22.618
I feel like it's my fault.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.888
What? That he drank?

26:24.989 --> 26:27.190
Well, yeah, and the fact that
he's back together with Dani.

26:29.593 --> 26:33.196
B, baby.

26:33.297 --> 26:36.632
You are not responsible for your father.

26:36.734 --> 26:38.134
Or for me or for anyone else.

26:41.005 --> 26:43.539
The only person that you're
responsible for is you.

26:56.953 --> 26:58.388
You need the bathroom again?

26:58.489 --> 27:00.823
Uh, no. I'm fine, thanks.

27:00.924 --> 27:05.728
Ok, well, since you're a,
you know, a flight risk,

27:05.829 --> 27:07.430
and they haven't got an
ankle bracelet on you yet,

27:07.531 --> 27:09.832
I'm going to have to secure things.

27:12.903 --> 27:15.438
Never had anyone go AWOL on me,
and I'm not going to start now.

27:15.539 --> 27:17.106
I'm a light sleeper.

27:17.207 --> 27:19.074
If you need anything during the night,

27:19.175 --> 27:21.977
just bang on the wall and
I'll come unlock the door.

27:22.078 --> 27:25.481
All right, then? Sleep well. Good night.

27:43.772 --> 27:46.975
So Vico took the plea, two years probation,

27:47.076 --> 27:48.776
and his parents are sending
him to military school.

27:48.878 --> 27:51.212
Two years? Are you serious,
two years probation?

27:51.313 --> 27:52.413
He almost killed my son.

27:52.514 --> 27:54.448
I know, I'm sorry,

27:54.549 --> 27:55.549
but he has no record and
a powerhouse attorney.

27:55.650 --> 27:57.318
At least he'll be out of your life.

28:09.797 --> 28:14.368
Excuse me. Excuse me, I need
to see the judge, please.

28:14.468 --> 28:15.402
He knows you're here.

28:24.979 --> 28:28.314
So did I just hear Coach Spears right?

28:28.416 --> 28:30.383
You're quitting the team?

28:30.484 --> 28:33.520
Oh, yeah.

28:33.621 --> 28:35.955
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:39.126 --> 28:42.028
I just figured wrestling
was your thing first.

28:42.129 --> 28:43.763
I can always go back to volleyball, right?

28:43.864 --> 28:47.634
Right. Sure.

28:47.735 --> 28:50.569
So you feel pretty good about that?

28:50.670 --> 28:53.439
About quitting? Yeah, I guess.

28:53.540 --> 28:55.707
Ok. Good.

28:55.809 --> 28:57.242
That's it? That's all you're going to say?

28:57.343 --> 29:00.211
Well, what do you want me to say?

29:00.313 --> 29:00.879
I don't know. Thank you?

29:03.082 --> 29:06.184
Thank you?

29:06.285 --> 29:08.520
For giving up something that
you love to make me feel better?

29:10.990 --> 29:14.392
Dumbass! It's not your
job to take care of me.

29:14.494 --> 29:18.063
If I'm unhappy, that's on me.

29:18.164 --> 29:23.000
It's my job to fix it, not yours.

29:23.101 --> 29:29.039
I'm going to talk to the guys,
tell them they're being jerks.

29:29.140 --> 29:32.510
And you are going to be there
because you are not quitting the team.

29:39.384 --> 29:40.651
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:40.752 --> 29:41.719
Much better.

29:49.461 --> 29:52.329
Oh, hell. God, I'm sorry.

29:54.065 --> 29:56.033
You were way better than her.

29:56.134 --> 29:58.335
You totally were.

29:58.436 --> 29:59.736
I mean, she only made the
team because she's Latin.

29:59.837 --> 30:02.473
They have to have diversity.

30:02.573 --> 30:05.609
They have like quotas or
something. It's school rules.

30:15.486 --> 30:17.887
Hey, hey, so?

30:17.988 --> 30:19.955
The clerk said he left
for the day. I'm sorry.

30:20.057 --> 30:22.691
He left? I've been sitting here
all day? Are you kidding me?

30:22.792 --> 30:24.527
I know, I'm sorry.

30:24.628 --> 30:27.263
- So what now? What...
- Unfortunately...

30:27.364 --> 30:29.265
Callie's going to have to stay in
the new foster home for the weekend.

30:35.372 --> 30:38.407
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I feel awful.

30:38.508 --> 30:41.743
- You better tell Jude.
- Do I have to?

30:41.844 --> 30:44.146
I know he's going to be disappointed,
but I don't know what to do.

30:44.247 --> 30:46.348
I'm going to be there as soon as I can, ok?

30:49.318 --> 30:50.252
You know what? I gotta go.

30:50.353 --> 30:52.921
Your Honor! Your Honor!

30:53.022 --> 30:55.457
I'm sorry. I have to get home. We
can discuss your case on Monday.

30:55.558 --> 30:57.192
Your Honor, they have taken
Callie out of our house.

30:57.293 --> 30:59.661
Please, please, help us. Help her.

30:59.762 --> 31:01.996
- You owe her that at least.
- I appreciate this is a...

31:02.097 --> 31:05.599
Sir, you cannot honestly tell
me that you have to get home,

31:05.700 --> 31:08.069
when you're letting Callie
be ripped out of ours.

31:08.170 --> 31:09.937
Do you not understand what
is happening to this girl?

31:10.038 --> 31:11.004
- I'm sorry.
- Sir?

31:14.209 --> 31:17.244
You need to think very carefully
about what you say next.

31:17.345 --> 31:19.380
You're on thin ice, my dear.

31:25.420 --> 31:27.254
Tomorrow, we've got chores in the morning,

31:27.355 --> 31:29.621
and then you've got to
go to your group, right?

31:30.492 --> 31:34.395
All right, then. Knock on
the wall if you need me.

31:34.496 --> 31:36.230
Sweet dreams.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.734
Hi, Helen. Sorry to bother you so late.

31:52.836 --> 31:54.203
No bothers. What are you doing here?

31:54.304 --> 31:55.871
I'm here to get my daughter.

31:58.641 --> 31:59.975
Where is she?

32:03.446 --> 32:04.779
- Hi.
- Hi, welcome home.

32:04.881 --> 32:07.216
Thank you.

32:07.317 --> 32:08.217
Oh, God, I hope that's the last
time I have to say those words.

32:08.318 --> 32:11.019
- Yeah.
- Hey.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.555
Oh.

32:13.656 --> 32:18.193
Hi. I am so sorry I didn't
get to see you read your essay.

32:18.294 --> 32:23.264
- How'd you do?
- I didn't do so good.

32:23.365 --> 32:25.599
Yeah, you did, Jude. You did just fine.

32:25.700 --> 32:28.669
I just...

32:28.770 --> 32:30.637
without you there, I didn't...

32:30.739 --> 32:32.706
even feel like what I was saying was true.

32:34.476 --> 32:36.377
Oh, well, I'd like to hear it.

32:42.484 --> 32:45.619
"What Anchor Beach Means
to Me" by Jude Adams Foster.

32:47.923 --> 32:52.059
"My first day at Anchor Beach, I got lost.

32:52.160 --> 32:52.793
Getting lost is nothing new to me.

32:56.430 --> 32:59.199
I've been to five different
schools in seven different grades

32:59.300 --> 33:02.702
and as soon as I learned my way around,

33:02.803 --> 33:05.238
I would be moved to a different one.

33:05.339 --> 33:07.640
Until I came to Anchor Beach.

33:07.741 --> 33:10.911
This is where I found my forever family.

33:11.012 --> 33:13.313
I think it's really cool that the
symbol of our school is the anchor.

33:13.414 --> 33:17.117
Because before I came
here I was always lost,

33:17.218 --> 33:20.420
always drifting from one home to
another, one school to another.

33:20.521 --> 33:23.556
but now I have an anchor.

33:23.657 --> 33:27.794
When you're out in the middle of the ocean,
you can be washed overboard and lost at sea.

33:27.895 --> 33:31.697
Once you have found your way into a harbor
and dropped your anchor, you're safe."

33:31.799 --> 33:34.634
"So Anchor Beach is my safe harbor.

33:34.735 --> 33:37.136
Being part of a family,

33:37.237 --> 33:40.940
whether it's a real one or one
like we have here at school,

33:41.041 --> 33:44.644
means you can be totally
yourself, totally honest,

33:44.745 --> 33:47.480
because you're safe to do so.

33:47.581 --> 33:51.116
Actually, it means you
have to be totally honest,

33:51.217 --> 33:54.353
because that's what family expects.

33:54.455 --> 33:57.590
I never thought it would happen,
but I'm not lost anymore."

34:01.895 --> 34:05.264
Oh, buddy.

34:06.700 --> 34:08.400
Hey, Callie.

34:08.502 --> 34:12.136
So listen we've got 30
days to get re-certified,

34:12.237 --> 34:13.303
and the honorable Judge

34:13.304 --> 34:15.864
I-Want-A-Clean-Trail-On-This
was not kidding.

34:16.007 --> 34:17.842
Yeah, so that's what we're gonna do.

34:17.944 --> 34:19.643
I promise you, we're going
to get this taken care of.

34:19.745 --> 34:20.846
Wait, but there's something else.

34:20.947 --> 34:23.915
What?

34:24.016 --> 34:25.851
I don't wanna feel like I can
just get yanked out of the house

34:25.952 --> 34:28.520
whenever something happens.

34:28.621 --> 34:30.355
I think I need...

34:34.126 --> 34:35.059
... I need an anchor.

34:38.697 --> 34:41.199
I think we should look for Robert Quinn...

35:07.692 --> 35:10.628
- Dad?
- Yeah. Hey!

35:14.599 --> 35:17.001
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

35:17.101 --> 35:21.505
- Is Dani here?
- No, she's at an AA meeting

35:21.606 --> 35:23.774
What's up?

35:26.411 --> 35:29.111
She's moving in, huh?

35:29.212 --> 35:31.748
Yeah. How'd you know?

35:31.849 --> 35:35.484
I, uh, bumped into her.

35:35.586 --> 35:38.021
You really love her?

35:38.121 --> 35:41.457
Yeah, I do.

35:41.559 --> 35:45.261
She saved my life, B.

35:45.362 --> 35:46.896
She's good for me.

35:46.997 --> 35:48.865
What's up? What's going on?

35:52.335 --> 35:53.670
You ok?

36:00.978 --> 36:02.045
I, uh...

36:08.919 --> 36:13.022
I can't feel some of my
fingers. They're still numb.

36:14.892 --> 36:20.128
And I don't...

36:20.229 --> 36:21.229
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to play anymore.

36:23.766 --> 36:27.569
- Have you tried?
- No, but what if I can't?

36:27.670 --> 36:32.107
Piano is...

36:32.208 --> 36:37.278
like the thing that made me me, you know?

36:38.081 --> 36:40.548
Look...

36:40.650 --> 36:42.017
What am I gonna do if I can't do it?

36:42.118 --> 36:44.285
Who am I going to be?

36:44.386 --> 36:47.288
We won't know until we
try, right? Ok? Come on.

37:22.758 --> 37:25.893
I've played this...

37:25.994 --> 37:28.462
a million times, and it's not
supposed to sound like that.

37:32.768 --> 37:34.968
B, you're just out of practice.

37:35.069 --> 37:37.637
No, I can't. I can't feel the keys.

37:37.738 --> 37:40.206
I can't feel them anymore.

37:40.307 --> 37:41.440
Can't play.

37:50.184 --> 37:51.584
Look...

37:54.621 --> 37:58.758
... maybe it'll come back,
you know? The feeling?

38:04.165 --> 38:06.166
Yeah.

38:20.214 --> 38:22.014
- Hello?
- Hey, Stef. It's Marie.

38:22.115 --> 38:24.217
Hey, Marie. What's up? Any news?

38:24.318 --> 38:27.386
As a matter of fact, we found Robert Quinn,

38:27.487 --> 38:29.622
and he's been served
with abandonment papers.

38:29.723 --> 38:32.491
Ok, that's great. That's
great. Thank you so much.

38:32.593 --> 38:34.560
You're welcome. And now we wait.

38:34.661 --> 38:37.896
Ok, all right. I will
tell Callie tonight, then.

38:37.997 --> 38:39.297
Ok, great. I'll talk to you later.

38:39.398 --> 38:40.098
You bet. Thank you again.

38:49.007 --> 38:50.408
Mr. Watson!

38:57.350 --> 38:59.917
So this is Officer Adams Foster. She has
a couple questions she'd like to ask you.

39:00.018 --> 39:01.986
Thank you so much for talking to me...

39:02.087 --> 39:05.623
So you saw Ana Gutierrez

39:05.724 --> 39:07.691
in an argument the night she
went missing a few months ago?

39:07.793 --> 39:11.462
- Uh, yeah.
- Ok.

39:11.563 --> 39:12.630
Do you remember the guy that she was
fighting with? What he looked like?

39:12.731 --> 39:15.599
Um, sorta?

39:15.700 --> 39:18.335
He was, I don't know,

39:18.436 --> 39:22.506
average height, broad shoulders, dark.

39:22.607 --> 39:25.042
Maybe Mexican or Italian?

39:25.144 --> 39:26.076
Is this the guy?

39:28.913 --> 39:34.384
Yeah, this is the guy. That's him.

39:34.485 --> 39:36.887
- Ok, great. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
- No problem.

39:36.988 --> 39:37.520
- Thank you, Mr. Watson.
- Good luck.

39:44.461 --> 39:46.729
So I decided we had to look for him.

39:46.831 --> 39:49.432
Smart girl.

39:49.533 --> 39:51.834
I just hope he doesn't turn out to
be some crazy loser or something.

39:51.935 --> 39:53.369
Me, too, girl. Me, too.

39:56.206 --> 39:59.909
Ok, so that's one vanilla
milkshake and one root beer.

40:00.010 --> 40:01.644
That's going to be...

40:01.745 --> 40:02.378
... $4.79.

40:04.047 --> 40:04.880
Here you go.

40:12.356 --> 40:13.022
Thanks.

40:17.893 --> 40:18.360
Hey, Callie, you want
to go bus those tables?

40:29.771 --> 40:32.573
- Thanks, Dad.
- You're welcome.

40:32.674 --> 40:33.607
Here.
