LITTLE MISS, HMM?

01:42.061 --> 01:45.732
HA HA HA! NOW THE TRICK
IS TO SET YOUR MIND

01:45.899 --> 01:47.901
TO DO TWO THINGS
AT ONCE,

01:48.067 --> 01:51.029
LIKE RUBBING YOUR

01:51.196 --> 01:54.449
AND PATTING YOUR HEAD
WITH YOUR OTHER HAND.

01:54.616 --> 01:58.077
IT TAKES SOME LEARNING,
BUT BRIGHT GIRLS LIKE YOU

IT IN NO TIME AT ALL.

MADDIE HAD THE PATIENCE.

YOUR FINGER ON IT.

04:09.042 --> 04:10.168
IF YOU TAKE YOUR
FINGER OFF IT,

PARCELED OUT SUSPICION.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.400

04:34.567 --> 04:37.570
THE JOY OF IT IS
LETTING US SURPRISE HER.

04:37.737 --> 04:40.657
NOT BAD, IF I DO
SAY IT MYSELF.

04:40.823 --> 04:43.076

05:08.977 --> 05:12.146
BUT LIKE MOST CHILDREN,
SHE THINKS UPON A PARENT

05:12.313 --> 05:13.731
AS A PERMANENT FIXTURE,

05:13.898 --> 05:15.775
A FEATURE OF THE LANDSCAPE
THAT ALWAYS WAS

05:15.942 --> 05:18.277
AND ALWAYS WILL BE,

UP AT THE POST OFFICE.

05:53.062 --> 05:55.314
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
A PARTY BREWING.

05:55.481 --> 05:57.650
SHE'LL BE
80 YEARS OLD TODAY.

05:57.817 --> 06:00.486
WISH HER A HAPPY
BIRTHDAY FOR ME--

06:00.653 --> 06:03.156
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
I'M INVITED,

06:03.322 --> 06:05.283
IN WHICH CASE
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

06:05.450 --> 06:06.409
YOU'RE INVITED.

06:06.576 --> 06:07.535

OH, IT'S A SURPRISE.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.206
I KNOW.
MADDIE TOLD ME.

06:13.291 --> 06:14.959
HA HA!

06:21.382 --> 06:25.261
ANOTHER LETTER
FROM ELIZA.

06:25.428 --> 06:31.934
"CAN'T MAKE IT... TOO
BUSY...SORRY." LIKE ALWAYS.

06:35.063 --> 06:37.106

OUT TO HER?

06:37.273 --> 06:40.777
OH, NO.

SOON ENOUGH.

OH, CHILDREN DO HAVE THEIR
OWN LIVES TO LIVE, YOU KNOW.

07:49.095 --> 07:50.888
WE LOSE SIGHT OF THAT.

07:51.055 --> 07:54.684
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS
BRINGING UP ME OWN.

07:54.851 --> 07:57.186
OH, SUCH A TIME I HAD!

07:57.353 --> 08:00.648
I NEVER GAVE A THOUGHT
TO ME OWN MOTHER.

OUT OF A SALOON

08:17.665 --> 08:21.043
WHEN SHE WAS 16,
SHE...SHE BROUGHT HOME

08:21.210 --> 08:26.465
A YOUNG BLOND BUCKO
FROM A ST. PATRICK'S DAY DANCE.

08:26.632 --> 08:29.468
I DIDN'T APPROVE OF
THE GLEAM IN HIS EYE,

08:29.635 --> 08:32.263
AND I PUT AN END TO IT
THEN AND THERE,

08:32.430 --> 08:35.975
AND SHE DIDN'T SPEAK
TO ME FOR A MONTH.

08:36.142 --> 08:39.896
AND ANDY...LORD LOVE HIM.

08:40.062 --> 08:42.064
HE WAS A TRIAL, THAT ONE.

08:42.231 --> 08:48.529
LORD KNOWS WHERE YOU WENT
OR WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.

08:48.696 --> 08:52.742

YOUR HEART OUT OVER THE YOUNG.

AND ON THE WING

08:55.077 --> 08:57.538

09:31.781 --> 09:33.074
AS WE GATHER TO MOURN
THE PASSING

09:33.241 --> 09:36.244
OF ONE WHO'S TOUCHED
ALL OUR LIVES,

09:36.410 --> 09:40.915
GIVEN WITHOUT STINT OF HER WARMTH
AND LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING,

09:41.082 --> 09:44.752
AND ASKED NOTHING BUT
WE LOVE HER IN RETURN.

09:44.919 --> 09:47.880
A GREAT AND NOBLE LADY
WAS MADDIE ELDER.

09:48.047 --> 09:50.174
ON THIS OCCASION...

09:50.341 --> 09:53.135
DON'T YOU WANT
TO GET CLOSER?

09:53.302 --> 09:56.222
I CAN MOURN BETTER
DOWN HERE.

09:56.389 --> 09:59.141
SHE CAN HEAR ME
WHEREVER SHE IS.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.060
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

10:01.227 --> 10:04.063
THEY'RE SAYING
GOOD-BYE.

10:04.230 --> 10:07.358
WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO
WHEN SHE CAN'T HEAR THEM?

10:07.525 --> 10:10.152
Laura: WHY DIDN'T THEY COME
TO HER BIRTHDAY?

10:10.319 --> 10:12.238
YOU CAN MISS
A BIRTHDAY,

10:12.405 --> 10:14.490
AND NOBODY SAYS
MUCH,

10:14.657 --> 10:17.201
BUT YOU CAN'T
MISS A FUNERAL.

10:17.368 --> 10:19.245
WHY NOT?

10:19.412 --> 10:22.415
THAT'S JUST THE WAY
GROWNUPS ARE.

10:22.581 --> 10:27.336
HMM...OUGHT TO BE
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

10:27.503 --> 10:29.755
A LOT OF THINGS
IN LIFE

10:29.922 --> 10:32.758
OUGHT TO BE THE
OTHER WAY AROUND.

10:32.925 --> 10:35.428
WE OUGHT TO HAVE OUR FUNERALS
WHILE WE'RE STILL ALIVE

10:35.594 --> 10:38.347
SO'S WE COULD SAY
GOOD-BYE TO EVERYBODY.

11:03.581 --> 11:07.752
OH, THANK YOU,
CHARLES.

11:13.883 --> 11:16.635
IT MIGHT BE KIND OF LONELY
AROUND HERE FOR A FEW DAYS.

11:16.802 --> 11:17.887
WHY DON'T YOU
COME STAY WITH US?

11:18.054 --> 11:20.139
OH, NOW, DON'T
WORRY ABOUT ME.

11:20.306 --> 11:22.266
I'VE GOT
A LOT TO DO.

11:22.433 --> 11:23.309
YOU SURE?

11:23.476 --> 11:24.560
SURE.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.146
AT MY AGE, YOU GET USED
TO LOSING A FRIEND

11:27.313 --> 11:29.190
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

11:29.357 --> 11:31.525
THANKS FOR
THE THOUGHT.

12:59.864 --> 13:02.283
Mary: DEAR FATHER
IN HEAVEN,

13:02.450 --> 13:03.909
WE THANK THEE.

13:04.076 --> 13:06.328

13:06.495 --> 13:10.416
AND OUR HEARTS TO
THY SERVICE. AMEN.

Charles: AMEN.

13:11.584 --> 13:13.294
Laura: AMEN.

13:13.461 --> 13:14.753
I SAW AMY HEARN AT
THE MERCANTILE TODAY.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.963
HOW IS SHE?

13:16.130 --> 13:17.965
WELL, SHE INSISTED ON
SETTLING UP HER BILL

13:18.132 --> 13:21.427
AS IF SHE HAD SOME
KIND OF PREMONITION.

13:21.594 --> 13:23.137
SHE'S GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING
TO OCCUPY HER MIND.

13:23.304 --> 13:26.015
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR HER BEING
IN THAT HOUSE BY HERSELF.

13:26.182 --> 13:27.975
[MUFFLED]
I'LL so SEE HER.

13:28.142 --> 13:29.059
ME, TOO.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.519
ONE OF YOU GO
TOMORROW,

13:30.686 --> 13:31.937
THE OTHER
GO THE NEXT DAY.

13:32.104 --> 13:35.274
THAT WAY, SHE'LL HAVE
TWO VISITS INSTEAD ONE.

13:35.441 --> 13:37.067
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.821
Caroline: I MADE SOME
PIE CRUST COOKIES.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.740
STOP BY WITH THEM
ON YOUR WAY TO SCHOOL.

13:42.907 --> 13:44.116
IF SHE WANTS TO VISIT
A LITTLE BIT,

13:44.283 --> 13:46.035
DON'T BE WORRIED ABOUT
BEING LATE FOR SCHOOL.

13:46.202 --> 13:48.662
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE HER
OVER FOR SUNDAY SUPPER.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.039
GOOD.

13:50.206 --> 13:53.167
I LIKE HER. SHE TALKS TO
US LIKE WE'RE GROWNUPS.

13:53.334 --> 13:55.753
BECAUSE SHE HASN'T
SEEN YOU EAT.

14:26.450 --> 14:29.203

HMM. HE HAD IT BEFORE?

15:02.861 --> 15:04.530
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

15:04.697 --> 15:10.327
HMM. WELL, I THINK WE HAVE A
SERIOUS CASE OF 5 DAY QUINCY.

15:10.494 --> 15:13.372
IT COMES ON MONDAY,
LEAVES ON FRIDAY.

15:13.539 --> 15:14.999
THAT'S RIGHT,
DOCTOR.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.417
OH, THAT'S NASTY.

15:16.584 --> 15:18.752
KEEPS AN EAGER YOUNG FELLOW
LIKE THIS OUT OF SCHOOL.

15:18.919 --> 15:19.878
[DOOR OPENS]

15:20.045 --> 15:21.630
DOC, MISS AMY'S SICK.

15:21.797 --> 15:22.590
BAD?

15:22.756 --> 15:24.049
I DON'T KNOW.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.974
GIVE THE LAD CASTOR OIL
EVERY 4 HOURS.

15:32.141 --> 15:34.393
GOTTA GO, MA.
I'LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.278
HMM.

15:46.822 --> 15:49.158
YOU HAVE PAIN, AMY?

15:49.325 --> 15:50.326
MMM-

15:50.492 --> 15:52.036
WHERE?

15:52.202 --> 15:54.747
IN ME ARM.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.373
BAD?

15:59.627 --> 16:01.378
WATER.

16:09.470 --> 16:13.057
DOGGONE IT, AMY. I CAN'T FIND
ANYTHING WRONG WITH YOU.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.017
YOUR TEMPERATURE'S
NORMAL.

16:15.184 --> 16:17.770
YOUR PULSE ISN'T GREAT,
BUT IT ISN'T BAD EITHER

16:17.936 --> 16:19.813
FOR A WOMAN YOUR AGE.

16:22.358 --> 16:26.654
DOC...CHARLES...

16:30.824 --> 16:33.118
PROMISE ME...

16:33.285 --> 16:34.787
ANYTHING, AMY.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.413
ME FUNERAL...

16:36.580 --> 16:40.501
NOW, I DON'T WANT YOU TO START
TALKING LIKE THAT, ALL RIGHT?

16:40.668 --> 16:42.795
YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF IT--

16:42.961 --> 16:46.131
THE WAKE, THE FUNERAL?

16:46.298 --> 16:47.174
THERE'S NOT
GOING TO BE

16:47.341 --> 16:48.967
A WAKE
OR A FUNERAL

16:49.134 --> 16:52.137
BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO DIE.

16:52.304 --> 16:56.684
NO BLARNEY, DOC.
NOT NOW.

16:58.143 --> 17:01.480
PROMISE ME YOU'LL WIRE
MY CHILDREN:

17:01.647 --> 17:06.610
SEAN, BRIDGET, ANDY.

17:06.777 --> 17:10.656
I DON'T KNOW IF
ANDY'S ALIVE OR DEAD,

17:10.823 --> 17:13.701
BUT TRY TO FIND HIM.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.619
PROMISE ME.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.709
I PROMISE, AMY.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.962
AND THE WAKE...

17:25.129 --> 17:30.092
YOU'LL GET THE PRIEST
FROM MANKATO...

17:30.259 --> 17:33.137
CHARLES?

17:33.303 --> 17:35.264
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

17:35.431 --> 17:36.890
YOU PROMISE.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.561
I PROMISE.

17:40.728 --> 17:42.104
IT'S SETTLED, THEN.

17:42.271 --> 17:47.359
THE WAKE WILL BE ON
WEDNESDAY, ON ME BIRTHDAY.

17:47.526 --> 17:51.155
THAT SHOULD BE A FINE DAY FOR
THE WAKE, DON'T YOU THINK?

17:52.364 --> 17:54.366
AMY, I NEVER
PUT A WOMAN,

17:54.533 --> 17:56.910
MUCH LESS AN 80-YEAR-OLD
WOMAN, OVER MY KNEE,

17:57.077 --> 17:59.455
BUT YOU'RE COMING CLOSE
TO BEING THE FIRST.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.039
OH, COME ON, DR. BAKER.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.291
SURELY YOU
UNDERSTAND WHY--

18:02.458 --> 18:04.126
I SURELY
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:04.293 --> 18:06.670
I DON'T UNDERSTAND EITHER. I
DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY, AMY.

18:06.837 --> 18:08.505
IT WASN'T MEANT
TO BE FUNNY.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.716
IT WAS MEANT
PURELY AND SIMPLY

18:10.883 --> 18:12.718
TO BRING ME CHILDREN
AND ME GRANDCHILDREN TO ME

18:12.885 --> 18:17.055
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE
YEARS THAN I'D LIKE TO COUNT.

18:17.222 --> 18:20.976
I SAW THE LIGHT WHEN
POOR MADDIE PASSED OVER.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.728
REST HER SOUL.

18:22.895 --> 18:25.773
AMY HEARN, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE

18:25.939 --> 18:27.816
YOUR BUSINESS
ELSEWHERE.

18:27.983 --> 18:31.028
I'M NOT GOING TO BE A
PART OF THIS KIND OF...

18:31.195 --> 18:32.738
DECEPTION!

18:32.905 --> 18:33.739
CHARLES?

18:33.906 --> 18:35.574
AMY, YOU CAN'T
BE SERIOUS.

18:35.741 --> 18:40.496
I WANT TO SEE ME CHILDREN AND MY
GRANDCHILDREN BEFORE I PASS OVER--

18:40.662 --> 18:43.499
AN ALTOGETHER SERIOUS
MATTER, CHARLES INGALLS,

18:43.665 --> 18:45.834
EVEN IF YOU
DON'T THINK SO.

18:46.001 --> 18:49.254
IT'S AN IDIOTIC CONVENTION
OF THE GROWNUP WORLD

18:49.421 --> 18:52.925
THAT YOUR LOVED ONES ONLY COME
TO SEE YOU WHEN YOU'RE DEAD

18:53.091 --> 18:56.428
INSTEAD OF WHEN YOU CAN...
OH, HOLD THEM

18:56.595 --> 18:59.097
AND LOVE THEM
AND TALK TO THEM.

18:59.264 --> 19:03.268
AND I'M GOING TO CHANGE
THAT IDIOTIC CUSTOM.

19:03.435 --> 19:05.521
AMY, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO TALK ME INTO--

19:05.687 --> 19:07.064
WHY NOT, PRAY TELL?

19:07.231 --> 19:10.025
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO WIRE
YOUR CHILDREN YOU'RE DEAD!

19:10.192 --> 19:12.694
BUT YOU'D WIRE THEM IF I
WAS DEAD, WOULDN'T YOU?

19:12.861 --> 19:14.321
OF COURSE I WOULD.

19:14.488 --> 19:17.866
THEN WHY? WHY WOULD
YOU PLEASE ME GHOST

19:18.033 --> 19:19.868
INSTEAD OF
ME FLESH AND BLOOD?

19:20.035 --> 19:22.120
AMY, IT ISN'T THAT.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.581
IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN,
WHAT IS IT?

19:24.748 --> 19:26.250
YOU'RE LIKE ME CHILDREN--

19:26.416 --> 19:29.545
A DUTIFUL LETTER
ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR:

19:29.711 --> 19:32.965
"DO YOU HAVE MONEY, MOTHER?
DO YOU LACK FOR ANYTHING?

19:33.131 --> 19:34.967
IS THERE
ANYTHING YOU WANT?"

19:35.133 --> 19:39.471
AND I WRITE THEM BACK,
"ALL I LACK IS YOU.

19:39.638 --> 19:43.267
WHEN CAN YOU COME
AND VISIT ME?"

19:43.433 --> 19:47.646
AND ANDY MARCHED OFF TO WAR
WHEN HE WAS 19,

19:47.813 --> 19:50.482
WITH A SMILE AND A WHISTLE

19:50.649 --> 19:53.151
AND A LAST HUG
AND A KISS.

19:53.318 --> 19:57.030
AND IN 15 YEARS,
I'VE NOT HAD A WORD FROM HIM.

20:00.033 --> 20:05.038
THEY'LL COME TO ME FUNERAL
BECAUSE IT'S A SIN NOT TO.

20:05.205 --> 20:08.959
AND THEY'LL WEEP
AND SAY ALL THE THINGS

20:09.126 --> 20:11.128
I'LL NOT BE THERE TO HEAR.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.466
AND YOU, BOTH OF YOU,

20:16.633 --> 20:19.386
YOU'RE THE SAME.

20:19.553 --> 20:23.473
YOU'D DO FOR ME CORPSE
BUT NOT FOR ME.

20:25.851 --> 20:28.896
AMY, I-.l..

20:31.398 --> 20:32.733
CHARLES?

20:37.529 --> 20:38.864
Doc?

20:41.867 --> 20:43.368
IT'S SETTLED, THEN.

20:43.535 --> 20:46.246
NOTIFY THE CHILDREN
AND THE PRIEST AT MANKATO,

20:46.413 --> 20:48.624
AND, CHARLES, YOU TAKE
CHARGE OF THE PREPARATIONS.

20:48.790 --> 20:51.376
NOW, COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

20:56.048 --> 20:58.008
Amy: THERE'S PLENTY
OF MONEY IN THE TILL,

20:58.175 --> 21:00.218
AND I'LL BE HERE
TO ADVISE YOU.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.054
THERE'LL BE
BLACKBERRY WINE,

21:02.220 --> 21:05.390
CHICKEN AND HAM
AND POTATO SALAD,

21:05.557 --> 21:07.768
AND A BIRTHDAY CAKE
WITH A CANDLE ON IT.

21:07.935 --> 21:11.396
NOW, YOU'D DO WELL TO GET
THE WIRES OFF RIGHT AWAY.

21:11.563 --> 21:13.899
THE PRIEST AT MANKATO
IS NEW, I UNDERSTAND,

21:14.066 --> 21:16.860
BUT THE PARISH WILL HAVE THE
RECORDS OF ME CHILDREN.

21:17.027 --> 21:18.987
NOW, OFF WITH YOU.

21:23.075 --> 21:26.870
REMEMBER, CHARLES, DON'T
SPARE THE EXPENSE:

21:27.037 --> 21:29.748
A FIRST-CLASS WAKE.

21:29.915 --> 21:32.334
YES, MA'AM.

21:32.501 --> 21:34.169
WHAT DO I SAY
YOU DIED OF?

21:34.336 --> 21:37.297
I'M 80 YEARS OLD
ON WEDNESDAY.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.175
SURELY YOU CAN
THINK OF SOMETHING.

21:41.259 --> 21:42.427
YOU WHAT?!

21:42.594 --> 21:44.429
[HAMMERING]

21:47.140 --> 21:49.351
I TOLD YOU, CAROLINE. MISS
AMY'S GOING TO DIE ON MONDAY,

21:49.518 --> 21:51.645
AND I HAVE TO
HANDLE THE WAKE.

21:51.812 --> 21:53.855
CHARLES,
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.941
I KNOW IT'S UNUSUAL.

21:56.108 --> 21:59.027
UNUSUAL?
UNUSUAL'S NOT THE WORD.

21:59.194 --> 22:02.072
WHY, IT'S...IT'S...

22:02.239 --> 22:03.824
[HAMMERING]

22:03.991 --> 22:05.450
CHARLES, WILL YOU
STOP THAT, PLEASE?

22:05.617 --> 22:07.035
THIS IS
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

22:07.202 --> 22:10.831
I WANT YOU TO GO OVER, AND I
WANT YOU TO EXPLAIN IT TO HER.

22:10.998 --> 22:11.832
CAROLINE, I AM NOT
GOING TO GO OVER

22:11.999 --> 22:13.208
AND TELL
AN 80-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

22:13.375 --> 22:14.751
THAT I'M GOING BACK
ON MY PROMISE TO HER.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.586
I CAN'T DO THAT.

22:16.753 --> 22:19.381
ALL RIGHT, THEN,
IF YOU CAN'T FACE HER...

22:19.548 --> 22:21.133
[HAMMERING]

22:21.299 --> 22:23.176
CHARLES!

22:23.343 --> 22:26.513
I'LL GO AND TALK TO HER.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.765
WELL, SOMEBODY HAS TO.

22:28.932 --> 22:31.935
WE SIMPLY CAN'T LET HER
GO THROUGH WITH THIS...

22:32.102 --> 22:34.354
THIS...PLAN.

22:35.814 --> 22:38.650
WELL, BY NOW, SHE'S
PROBABLY THOUGHT BETTER

22:38.817 --> 22:42.029
OF THE WHOLE IDEA
ANYWAY. HA HA!

22:53.582 --> 22:54.875
MARY?

22:58.003 --> 23:00.005
MARY.

23:00.172 --> 23:03.008
WHAT?

23:03.175 --> 23:05.093
HOW LONG DO YOU
WANT TO LIVE TO BE?

23:05.260 --> 23:08.722
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
LET ME SLEEP.

23:08.889 --> 23:10.474
I WANT TO LIVE
FOREVER.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.601
WELL, YOU CAN'T.

23:12.768 --> 23:14.352
WHO SAID?

23:14.519 --> 23:16.730
GOD.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.982
GOD NEVER
TOLD YOU THAT.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.735
WILL YOU GO
TO SLEEP?

23:25.363 --> 23:28.116
THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE.

23:28.283 --> 23:31.119
THAT'S WHAT
WHAT'S LIKE?

23:31.286 --> 23:32.662
GOING TO SLEEP.

23:32.829 --> 23:38.001
WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP,
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE DEAD.

23:38.168 --> 23:39.878
GOOD NIGHT.

24:23.088 --> 24:24.464
[DOOR OPENS]

24:52.951 --> 24:54.953
WAS SHE
VERY DISAPPOINTED?

24:55.120 --> 24:57.164
NO.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.624
HOW DID YOU
MANAGE TO DO IT?

25:01.334 --> 25:03.003
I'M BAKING THE CAKE.

25:37.078 --> 25:38.205
MARK MY WORDS.

25:38.371 --> 25:41.333
UH-HUH. YOU KNOW WHAT
FREE SILVER MEANS.

25:41.499 --> 25:42.834
INFLATION!

25:43.001 --> 25:46.379
ALL I KNOW IS, I'D RATHER
HAVE A SILVER DOLLAR

25:46.546 --> 25:47.714
THAN A PIECE OF PAPER.

25:47.881 --> 25:49.925
GET THOSE BIG CLODHOPPERS
OFF OF THERE.

25:50.091 --> 25:51.551
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE DIFFERENCE IS?

25:51.718 --> 25:54.054
YOU GOT 100 SILVER DOLLARS
IN YOUR POCKET,

25:54.221 --> 25:57.182
AND YOU FALL INTO
A RIVER, YOU DROWN.

25:57.349 --> 25:59.017
THAT IS THE ONLY
DIFFERENCE.

25:59.184 --> 26:00.602
HUH.

26:00.769 --> 26:02.145
Laura:
DOC BAKER?

26:02.312 --> 26:04.356

BUT SHE'S GOING TO GET ALL
BETTER, ISN'T SHE, DOCTOR?

26:14.866 --> 26:19.079

I SURELY HOPE SO.

THAT'S
A FINE OLD LADY.

26:29.756 --> 26:33.551

THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN...

26:33.718 --> 26:36.429
EXCUSE ME, OLESON.
GOT TO BE GOING.

26:50.402 --> 26:52.779
YOU WON'T
BE STAYING LONG.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.449
IT'S ALL CLEAR.

27:39.451 --> 27:42.620
I WONDER HOW COME WE DON'T
HAVE WAKES AT OUR CHURCH.

27:42.787 --> 27:45.040
'CAUSE IT'S FUN, AND IF
IT'S FUN, IT'S SINFUL.

A FEELING ABOUT IT.

IN HIS EYES,

28:50.397 --> 28:53.650
AND HE'D HAVE YOU IN
THE PALM OF HIS HAND.

28:53.817 --> 28:57.112
HE COULD TALK A SERPENT
OUT OF A TREE, THAT ONE.

44:55.736 --> 44:59.323
I'VE GOT A RIGHT TO SEE ME OWN
CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN.

44:59.490 --> 45:02.201
IT COMES BEFORE
ANYTHING ELSE,

45:02.368 --> 45:05.245
AND YOU ASK
HOW I COULD DO IT.

45:05.412 --> 45:10.334
WELL, IT ISN'T HARD WHEN
YOU'VE TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE,

45:10.501 --> 45:13.796
WHEN YOU'RE SO HUNGRY FOR THE
SIGHT AND FEEL OF YOUR FAMILY

45:13.962 --> 45:17.341
YOU CAN'T SLEEP
AT NIGHTS THINKING OF THEM.

45:17.508 --> 45:19.426
AND WHEN IT COMES TO YOU,

45:19.593 --> 45:22.930
THE ONE THING
THAT'LL BRING THEM TO YOU

45:23.097 --> 45:26.475
IS YOUR OWN WAKE...

45:26.642 --> 45:31.563
WELL, IT ISN'T HARD
TO DO AT ALL, AT ALL.

45:35.067 --> 45:38.654
SEAN, I HEARD YOU SAY IT.

45:38.821 --> 45:40.280
"WHY IS IT," YOU SAID,

45:40.447 --> 45:42.866
"YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL
THEY'RE GONE

45:43.033 --> 45:46.245
BEFORE YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY MEAN TO YOU?"

45:48.705 --> 45:54.461
WELL, YOU MEAN
EVERYTHING TO ME, YOU 3.

46:02.094 --> 46:05.556
I'M 80 YEARS OLD,

46:05.722 --> 46:09.685
AND I DON'T HAVE
MANY BIRTHDAYS LEFT.

46:09.852 --> 46:13.856
MAYBE...MAYBE NOT EVEN ONE,

46:14.022 --> 46:16.650
AND WHEN YOU THINK OF THAT,

46:16.817 --> 46:20.821
YOU'RE APT...

46:20.988 --> 46:23.532
YOU'RE APT TO BE FOOLISH.

46:28.954 --> 46:30.581
MA?

46:30.747 --> 46:32.624
OH, ANDY!

46:32.791 --> 46:33.709
OH, MA!

46:33.876 --> 46:36.462
OH, ANDY,
MY DEAR BOY.

46:36.628 --> 46:37.671
AND SEAN.

46:37.838 --> 46:39.798
OH, MOTHER,
I'M SO SORRY.

46:39.965 --> 46:41.925
AND BRIDGET!

46:42.092 --> 46:44.219
OH, MA.
OH, MA!

46:46.638 --> 46:51.685
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT THE BLOND BOY.

46:51.852 --> 46:55.063
AYE, IT WAS
A GREAT RELIEF TO ME.

46:55.230 --> 46:57.441
I WASN'T AT ALL SURE.

46:57.608 --> 47:00.444
OH! OH, MOTHER!

47:00.611 --> 47:03.405
[SEAN AND ANDY LAUGHING]

47:12.164 --> 47:13.957
WELL, COME ON! YOU HEARD
WHAT EVERYBODY SAID.

47:14.124 --> 47:16.835
THIS IS NOT A WAKE.
IT'S A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

47:33.101 --> 47:35.020
[CLAPPING]

47:45.822 --> 47:48.158
I HOPE YOU FIND IT
IN YOUR HEART, FATHER,

47:48.325 --> 47:50.494
TO FORGIVE ME
FOR FOOLING YOU SO.

47:50.661 --> 47:52.120
WELL, IT'S
A LITTLE IRREGULAR,

47:52.287 --> 47:55.332
BUT I THINK THE BISHOP
WILL UNDERSTAND.

47:55.499 --> 47:58.043
IF YOU FEEL
YOU MUST TELL HIM.

48:07.511 --> 48:10.138
DOC, YOU GOT PERMISSION
TO DANCE WITH MY WIFE.

48:10.305 --> 48:12.391
[LAUGHTER]
