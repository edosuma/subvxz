(ominous music)

01:19.452 --> 01:21.785
(grunting)

01:27.684 --> 01:30.536
(dramatic music)

01:30.536 --> 01:33.203
(woman screams)

01:34.102 --> 01:36.685
(upbeat music)

03:37.969 --> 03:40.386
(calm music)

03:52.666 --> 03:55.583
(camera clicking)

04:11.979 --> 04:14.729
(phone ringing)

04:16.223 --> 04:17.090
- This is Art.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.347
- You Art, it's Tee.

04:18.347 --> 04:20.100
- Oh hey man, how's it going?

04:20.100 --> 04:21.400
- You know can't complain.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.430
Listen my boss asked me if
I knew anybody with some

04:23.430 --> 04:25.790
experience that could come
help out in the shop today.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.429
- The silkscreen shop?

04:27.429 --> 04:28.570
- Yeah yeah yeah look
man, this bitch Juliette

04:28.570 --> 04:30.850
didn't come in today and
we could really use a hand.

04:30.850 --> 04:32.700
I know you're an artist and you got

04:32.700 --> 04:34.060
a little bit of shop experience.

04:34.060 --> 04:34.933
- Cool I'm down.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.360
We talking like right now?

04:38.360 --> 04:40.340
- No time like the present Bro Chacho.

04:40.340 --> 04:44.243
- Cool I'll be there in 30
brother, and hey thanks man.

04:45.718 --> 04:48.301
(violin music)

04:57.598 --> 05:00.265
(camera clicks)

05:02.818 --> 05:05.401
(upbeat music)

05:15.460 --> 05:17.543
- Art dude, glad you could make it.

05:18.656 --> 05:20.850
- I'm gonna stomp the shit out of him.

05:20.850 --> 05:22.419
- Hey man.

05:22.419 --> 05:25.380
- Great to see you, it's
been a minute. Cool shop.

05:25.380 --> 05:26.840
- Yeah, it's just a little crazy

05:26.840 --> 05:28.470
around here in case you haven't noticed.

05:28.470 --> 05:29.690
- It's all good.

05:29.690 --> 05:31.330
So what are you gonna have me doing?

05:31.330 --> 05:33.190
- Pulling shirts, catching shirts,

05:33.190 --> 05:35.803
printing shirts, you know shirts.

05:36.858 --> 05:37.800
- I think I can handle that.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.810
- Well let me introduce
you to everybody, come on.

05:40.810 --> 05:43.640
This here is poncho, he
is the best in the biz.

05:43.640 --> 05:48.340
Hey Ponch, this is Art, he's
going to be helping us today.

05:48.340 --> 05:50.720
He's been screen printing for a while.

05:50.720 --> 05:51.870
- Nice to meet you.

05:51.870 --> 05:52.843
- You don't know.

05:54.570 --> 05:57.040
- Don't worry about him,
he says that all the time.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.560
This is Henly, he just started

05:58.560 --> 06:00.400
but he's an aspiring printer.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.400
- How are you?

06:01.400 --> 06:02.233
- I'm good man.

06:02.233 --> 06:04.420
- I'd like to get your
opinion on something.

06:09.071 --> 06:09.971
What do you think?

06:11.531 --> 06:13.490
- That's really something.

06:13.490 --> 06:15.520
- Yeah I'm working on my own T-shirt line.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.100
This is gonna change everything,

06:17.100 --> 06:18.890
bears are really in right now.

06:18.890 --> 06:21.313
- Especially bears this
big old dolphin dicks.

06:22.250 --> 06:23.963
- Keep up the good work.

06:23.963 --> 06:25.310
I think you're really
onto something there.

06:25.310 --> 06:26.143
- I know.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.320
- Alright this is Mark and
Reggie, they own the shop.

06:33.320 --> 06:37.000
Reggie's cool but Marks a
little bit of tally whacker.

06:37.000 --> 06:37.833
- Got it.

06:38.690 --> 06:41.430
- Yo Mark, Reg this is the
dude I was telling you about.

06:41.430 --> 06:42.263
- What's happening guys?

06:42.263 --> 06:44.351
Thanks for letting me help out.

06:44.351 --> 06:45.660
- Well it's good to have you aboard Art.

06:45.660 --> 06:48.060
So Tee tells me you're an
artist and a photographer?

06:48.060 --> 06:49.110
- Yeah, that's right.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.577
- You look you'd be good
at cleaning screens.

06:54.870 --> 06:55.740
Why don't you have Tee
here show you around,

06:55.740 --> 06:57.360
we'll get the details later.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.490
Shit's crazy right now,
all of my major printers

06:59.490 --> 07:02.543
came in at once and I'm literally
about to choke somebody.

07:03.851 --> 07:05.430
- Oh I gotcha man, well look forward to--

07:05.430 --> 07:07.650
- Mark, what about today?

07:07.650 --> 07:09.440
- Lace I told you we can't do it today.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.919
Juliette didn't show up.

07:10.919 --> 07:12.060
- Keep on of these on you,

07:12.060 --> 07:15.140
it's a USB drive, also a laser pointer.

07:15.140 --> 07:16.492
- [Art] Y'all print these too?

07:16.492 --> 07:17.730
- No just a promo item, come on.

07:17.730 --> 07:20.220
Let me give you the 10 cent tour man.

07:20.220 --> 07:22.530
This is the press I always use.

07:22.530 --> 07:24.540
Poncho is always on that one.

07:24.540 --> 07:27.670
Back there we've got the
darkroom and the washout area.

07:27.670 --> 07:29.390
The shiters back in that corner,

07:29.390 --> 07:30.840
and the dog's name is Silkie.

07:31.970 --> 07:34.120
- So what's the deal
with all these people?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.920
They all run local T-shirt companies?

07:35.920 --> 07:37.930
- Yeah they're all scrambling
right now because this new

07:37.930 --> 07:40.540
line of shirts called
Elegant Decay just hit.

07:40.540 --> 07:42.590
It's affecting everybody's business.

07:42.590 --> 07:45.300
You won't believe how
competitive these people are.

07:45.300 --> 07:48.570
- Yeah that guy's totally
giving that lady the stink eye.

07:48.570 --> 07:51.420
- That's Hanes, he runs
Crescent City Clothings.

07:51.420 --> 07:53.550
He sells the most stuff in
here and he's still worried

07:53.550 --> 07:55.510
that everybody else is such a threat.

07:55.510 --> 07:57.870
Funny thing is the lady
he's stink balling now

07:57.870 --> 07:59.020
really looks up to him.

08:00.667 --> 08:01.660
The lady in the Below Sea Level shirt?

08:01.660 --> 08:03.090
- Yeah that's Lace.

08:03.090 --> 08:05.760
And what's funnier than that is see her.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.740
- [Art] Melting Plot?

08:06.740 --> 08:09.670
- That's Bella, Lace's longtime rival.

08:09.670 --> 08:12.010
Let's just say they've
had a colorful past.

08:12.010 --> 08:14.030
- They used to mess around?

08:14.030 --> 08:15.060
I could see that.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.800
- Wait till you see
Bella's daughter Cammi,

08:16.800 --> 08:19.510
she will get your dick pregnant dude.

08:19.510 --> 08:21.370
- Who's getting pregnant?

08:21.370 --> 08:23.879
- You are, if I've got
anything do with it.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.790
- Hi I'm Heather.

08:25.790 --> 08:27.250
- Art.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.130
- This knucklehead's your friend?

08:29.130 --> 08:30.870
Think you would have more sense than that.

08:30.870 --> 08:32.120
- Keep joking beautiful.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.960
Heather's new here but she'll do fine

08:33.960 --> 08:36.150
as long as she does what I say.

08:36.150 --> 08:37.360
- See what I have to deal with?

08:37.360 --> 08:38.853
- I'm just joking doll face.

08:40.300 --> 08:41.983
She drives me insane dude.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.220
Hi Polly, how's my little Olive Loaf?

08:46.220 --> 08:49.210
- Oh hey T, I hate it
when you call me that.

08:49.210 --> 08:50.420
- Olive Loaf?

08:50.420 --> 08:53.530
- Polly's nice, dumb but nice.

08:53.530 --> 08:54.740
I mean she's not cutthroat like

08:54.740 --> 08:56.810
all these other cretins in here.

08:56.810 --> 08:58.227
- What's her company called?

08:58.227 --> 09:03.227
- All Dat Jazz, dumb.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.380
All these people are exploiting
our fine city with their

09:06.380 --> 09:10.631
gaudy bullshit, one day
there's gonna be a reckoning.

09:10.631 --> 09:12.850
- Put my fucking hands on
him, I'm gonna hurt him.

09:12.850 --> 09:14.623
- What's his story?

09:14.623 --> 09:18.610
- Oh that's Tank he does all
the Ninth Ward Soldier stuff.

09:18.610 --> 09:21.175
Just stay on his good side,
that's all I'm saying.

09:21.175 --> 09:25.300
- I had no idea this
business was so ruthless.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.030
- Hey Marcus you think
I got time to hang out

09:27.030 --> 09:28.770
with these low rent ripoff artists?

09:28.770 --> 09:30.832
Starting to draw flies here.

09:30.832 --> 09:35.832
(dramatic music)
(camera clicking)

09:41.470 --> 09:43.210
- What we looking at today Sax?

09:43.210 --> 09:45.990
- Dead girl, she had this
axe buried in her chest

09:46.905 --> 09:48.473
and throat slit for good measure.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.750
- Who's the girl?

09:50.750 --> 09:52.763
- No idea, no ID.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.500
She had money on her when we found her,

09:55.500 --> 09:57.463
but no wallet and no identification.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.600
- How long she been laying
down here like this?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.850
- I had to guess I'd say this happened

10:01.850 --> 10:04.250
around three, maybe 4:00 a.m.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.590
Whoever hit her with the
axe is highly skilled,

10:06.590 --> 10:08.493
did so from maybe 15 feet away.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.960
- She was a pretty girl.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.550
- Does look like the
neck wound was tampered

10:13.550 --> 10:16.030
with after the initial slice though.

10:16.030 --> 10:18.811
No tracks so far that we found.

10:18.811 --> 10:19.993
Somebody was real careful.

10:21.270 --> 10:23.020
- This is not a normal killing Sax.

10:23.970 --> 10:27.283
Drive bys, gang retaliations,
this is not that.

10:28.200 --> 10:31.413
This, this was personal.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.603
- I just made more coffee.

10:45.322 --> 10:46.960
- You still drinking coffee?

10:46.960 --> 10:49.610
- I'm just getting my fix
Heather, beats crack right?

10:52.866 --> 10:54.266
- Are you staring at my ass?

10:56.170 --> 10:57.003
Jesus.

10:57.003 --> 10:57.836
- He gorgeous.

10:58.730 --> 10:59.810
Thinking about asking Art out for

10:59.810 --> 11:01.490
some beers later, you want to join?

11:01.490 --> 11:03.703
You know welcome him to the family?

11:03.703 --> 11:06.380
- I don't know, text me later
maybe I'll come meet you.

11:06.380 --> 11:08.029
- Sweet.

11:08.029 --> 11:10.612
(upbeat music)

11:11.740 --> 11:14.020
- Tee are you seriously
checking out my boobs?

11:14.020 --> 11:14.853
- Huh?

11:15.906 --> 11:18.573
(upbeat music)

12:32.706 --> 12:34.788
- Are you fucking kidding me?

12:34.788 --> 12:37.371
(upbeat music)

12:47.280 --> 12:49.942
- [Tee] Hey Sean can I get a couple IPAs?

12:49.942 --> 12:51.863
- You're cool Tee, but
I need to see his ID.

12:52.740 --> 12:55.400
- Juliette Shields, 26.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.253
Originally from Lafayette, Louisiana.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.710
She got picked up twice for
shoplifting organic produce.

13:01.710 --> 13:03.160
- Sounds like a hardened criminal.

13:03.160 --> 13:03.993
- Right?

13:03.993 --> 13:05.090
- Current address?

13:05.090 --> 13:07.830
- [Sax] Nope, just the
one on file in Lafayette.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.634
- So unless she's commuting to the city

13:09.634 --> 13:11.310
every morning we don't have an address.

13:11.310 --> 13:13.040
- That's a hell of a commute peddling

13:13.040 --> 13:14.860
that cruiser she was riding last night.

13:14.860 --> 13:16.470
- Any prints on that axe handle?

13:16.470 --> 13:18.450
- Partials, either he tried to wipe it off

13:18.450 --> 13:21.200
afterwards or he's got scarred hands.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.810
- Or he wore rubber gloves.

13:22.810 --> 13:24.700
- If he wore rubber gloves there
wouldn't have been a print.

13:24.700 --> 13:27.230
- Disposables can leave an impression.

13:27.230 --> 13:30.643
So we have no address, we have no name.

13:32.260 --> 13:34.110
But we do have a place of employment.

13:35.500 --> 13:38.960
This is my friend, is what we call a lead.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.200
- Well Polly as it is we stayed
late to finish this order.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.950
I mean I'd love to have all
of them done for you but

13:44.950 --> 13:47.440
it's been 12 hours today
we're really exhausted.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.130
- You can pick him up
tonight if you like Lace.

13:49.130 --> 13:52.540
Mark and I were about to start
closing up, but we'll be here

13:52.540 --> 13:55.330
for a bit and we have some
of your order right now.

13:55.330 --> 13:57.530
- Alright well I'll tell you
what Polly just we'll stay

13:57.530 --> 14:00.550
late for you, yeah come pick
them up tonight absolutely.

14:00.550 --> 14:02.270
Yeah anything for you.

14:02.270 --> 14:04.090
Alrighty then, no problem bye.

14:04.090 --> 14:06.300
- Okay great, eight o'clock it is.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.570
Thank you Lace, bye.

14:08.570 --> 14:10.330
- God these women are so pushy.

14:10.330 --> 14:14.980
Do this, do that, I need
them tonight, blah blah blah.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.740
So fucking stupid.

14:16.740 --> 14:17.573
- I know man.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.930
Lace really gets my fucking blood boiling

14:19.930 --> 14:21.160
when she talks to me
like I'm a little kid.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.710
- Reg one day we're gonna have to show

14:22.710 --> 14:24.400
them that we're running the show.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.233
- Yeah.

14:25.233 --> 14:27.340
- Show them that we don't
take shit from nobody.

14:27.340 --> 14:31.300
- It's just like these fucking
menopause twats treat us

14:31.300 --> 14:34.030
like kindergartners, we run
this fucking business man.

14:34.030 --> 14:36.840
- Right, and meanwhile we
have dicks and they don't.

14:36.840 --> 14:37.673
- Exactly.

14:37.673 --> 14:39.022
- You see what I mean?

14:39.022 --> 14:40.008
And they're so stupid too.

14:40.008 --> 14:42.680
I'm gonna print a towel
that says gumbo on it.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.320
Fucking stupid.

14:44.320 --> 14:47.523
- Wait, I have something to show you.

14:55.890 --> 14:57.550
Check this out man.

14:57.550 --> 14:59.910
- Wow, where'd you get that?

14:59.910 --> 15:02.680
- Tank hooked it up,
it's brand fucking new.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.030
- Dude let me check it out.

15:06.820 --> 15:10.030
(mimics gun firing)

15:10.030 --> 15:11.770
- Dude you look tough with that gun.

15:11.770 --> 15:12.993
- I feel tough.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.860
What's that Polly?

15:15.860 --> 15:17.740
You need the gumbo towels today?

15:17.740 --> 15:19.482
Fuck no.

15:19.482 --> 15:21.732
(laughing)

15:22.630 --> 15:25.033
Dude, Polly's on her way over here.

15:25.994 --> 15:27.540
- You want to do something?

15:27.540 --> 15:30.400
- Man it's great to be
back in a real shop.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.190
- Well it's kind of like slow death.

15:33.190 --> 15:35.370
But it keeps the buds in the bowl I guess.

15:35.370 --> 15:38.190
I'm just doing it to my
gyno graffiti takes off.

15:38.190 --> 15:40.750
Or maybe I was meant to work
with cancer causing chemicals

15:40.750 --> 15:43.450
and slave away in a sweatshop
for the rest of my life.

15:44.290 --> 15:45.770
- So tell me about Mark and Reggie.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.830
Are they pretty cool to work for?

15:47.830 --> 15:49.350
- That's hard to say.

15:49.350 --> 15:51.460
Sometimes I don't think they're
playing with a full deck.

15:51.460 --> 15:52.720
- Really.

15:52.720 --> 15:55.040
- Well I'm pretty sure Mark's
having an affair with Silkie.

15:55.040 --> 15:55.873
- The dog?

15:55.873 --> 15:57.320
- And he has problems with his libido.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.810
And as for Reggie, he's got
this thing for older women

16:00.810 --> 16:02.698
but he's scared of experience.

16:02.698 --> 16:05.870
- How do you know so much
about their personal lives?

16:05.870 --> 16:07.220
- I have my ways, trust me.

16:09.270 --> 16:13.260
- Reggie likes cougars but is
afraid of experience, weird.

16:13.260 --> 16:14.680
- Yeah you won't catch me groping no

16:14.680 --> 16:16.760
wrinkled beef curtain that's for sure.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.247
I'm saving my nectar for Heather.

16:18.247 --> 16:19.297
- You really dig her?

16:20.290 --> 16:22.270
I'm anxious to see Bella's daughter.

16:22.270 --> 16:24.200
- Dude you will not be disappointed.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.360
She does all the modeling
for Melting Plot.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.990
And man spank bank material.

16:28.990 --> 16:30.830
- Yeah I'd really like to--

16:30.830 --> 16:31.900
- Fuck her.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.882
- Yeah dude, fuck them all.

16:33.882 --> 16:35.790
- That's what I'm talking about man.

16:35.790 --> 16:37.316
Get pumped.

16:37.316 --> 16:39.912
(knocking on door)

16:39.912 --> 16:43.210
(dramatic music)

16:43.210 --> 16:44.840
Alright remember what we discussed.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.570
When I give the cue you pull the gun.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.850
Polly, come on in.

16:48.850 --> 16:49.830
- Hey guys.

16:49.830 --> 16:52.460
Thanks for staying late
to get these done for me.

16:52.460 --> 16:53.820
So you think you're gonna have

16:53.820 --> 16:55.520
the rest of them done by tomorrow?

16:57.450 --> 17:00.270
- No Polly, I don't
think that's gonna work.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.900
- Oh really, I know you guys are so busy.

17:02.900 --> 17:06.840
So maybe by this weekend?

17:06.840 --> 17:09.330
- Really don't think we can do that.

17:09.330 --> 17:13.560
- Well okay, so when can I expect them by?

17:13.560 --> 17:15.230
- Well maybe we'll print them.

17:15.230 --> 17:17.553
Or maybe we'll shove up
your goddamn asshole.

17:19.980 --> 17:20.848
(Polly gasps)

17:20.848 --> 17:22.431
Oh, no no no no no.

17:24.419 --> 17:25.836
Here take a seat.

17:27.840 --> 17:28.920
- What are you doing Marcus?

17:28.920 --> 17:30.400
Why are y'all doing this?

17:30.400 --> 17:33.560
- Because we have had it
up to here with you cunts.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.310
You want your towels printed tomorrow?

17:35.310 --> 17:36.780
Too bad fuck face.

17:36.780 --> 17:38.210
- What did I do?

17:38.210 --> 17:40.990
- So stupid, oh I'm gonna print towels

17:40.990 --> 17:43.640
that say gumbo on them, fucking stupid.

17:43.640 --> 17:47.170
- Marcus I sell thousands of
those a week, they're a hit.

17:47.170 --> 17:49.320
- Everybody is so fucking stupid.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.600
- Oh she's tied pretty tight.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.636
This fuck face isn't going anywhere.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.810
- You you feel better Polly?

17:54.810 --> 17:57.839
- Let me go please, I didn't do anything.

17:57.839 --> 17:58.672
(fingers snapping)

17:58.672 --> 17:59.505
- Yeah.

18:01.040 --> 18:03.640
- We're gonna make you pay
for such ignorance Polly.

18:05.240 --> 18:08.780
- Stop is Marcus, you're hurting me.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.480
- [Mark] Oh you want to know pain?

18:13.020 --> 18:16.263
- It tastes like doggie. (spitting)

18:20.120 --> 18:23.530
- Polly I think we made a
mistake here, I am so sorry.

18:23.530 --> 18:25.240
Reggie and I wanted to
play a little joke on you

18:25.240 --> 18:27.840
and I think we might have
taken it a little too far.

18:28.756 --> 18:29.589
- Joke?

18:29.589 --> 18:32.550
- Yeah this has all been a
misunderstanding and I apologize.

18:33.490 --> 18:37.108
Appreciate it if you could
keep that between you and me.

18:37.108 --> 18:37.941
And we'll have the rest of your

18:37.941 --> 18:39.140
order done for tomorrow certainly.

18:42.390 --> 18:43.290
You're free to go.

18:46.790 --> 18:47.793
- Okay?

18:59.770 --> 19:01.990
- Dude what the fuck was that?

19:01.990 --> 19:02.823
- What?

19:02.823 --> 19:04.708
- I thought we were gonna.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.708
- Oh you're jealous 'cause I get a kiss.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.490
- Shit man what now?

19:09.490 --> 19:11.170
- Well here give me this.

19:11.170 --> 19:13.140
Checking it out it's your turn.

19:13.140 --> 19:14.780
Isn't Lace coming over for eight o'clock?

19:14.780 --> 19:16.200
- Yeah.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.300
- You gotta try it man, it's invigorating.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.930
- Dude Polly's halfway to
the fucking cops by now.

19:21.930 --> 19:23.433
- No way, she wants it.

19:26.180 --> 19:27.430
- It's just rude.

19:27.430 --> 19:29.580
Like I talk to Juliette every single day.

19:29.580 --> 19:31.030
So for her not to text me back

19:31.030 --> 19:33.030
is really out of character for her.

19:33.030 --> 19:34.960
Like if I pissed her off that's one thing.

19:34.960 --> 19:39.038
But I didn't, and she hasn't
posted anything all day.

19:39.038 --> 19:41.520
She wouldn't just up and leave town.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.228
- You think she got arrested?

19:43.228 --> 19:45.180
- She smoked a lot of pot but

19:45.180 --> 19:47.180
they don't arrest you for that.

19:47.180 --> 19:49.010
Otherwise she doesn't
drive so she couldn't

19:49.010 --> 19:51.260
have got pulled over for anything.

19:51.260 --> 19:53.620
- Maybe she found a dude to party with.

19:53.620 --> 19:56.260
- You know Juliette was working
on her own line of shirts.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.670
Maybe you know she went
with that full time

19:58.670 --> 20:00.710
and decided she didn't
need the shop anymore.

20:00.710 --> 20:02.623
- Well it's rude not to say anything.

20:03.705 --> 20:05.000
- So did she get fired?

20:05.000 --> 20:06.650
Am I just a fill in for her?

20:06.650 --> 20:08.210
- No even if she didn't get fired

20:08.210 --> 20:09.820
we still need you in the shop.

20:09.820 --> 20:13.270
- Yeah Art you're family now,
and Crescent City Clothing

20:13.270 --> 20:16.283
moves enough product to
keep us busy for decades.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.390
Well I should be going.

20:20.390 --> 20:21.550
- I'll walk you out.

20:21.550 --> 20:24.000
- Yeah I gotta go too
bro, I gotta hit the hay.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.850
- Okay, then you can both see me out.

20:55.122 --> 20:56.593
At least we know it's loaded now.

- I gotta get these and get out of here.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.350
I can't believe you made me so late

21:26.350 --> 21:28.363
and you didn't even put him into dozens.

21:29.220 --> 21:30.833
Reggie I told you about this.

21:32.580 --> 21:34.820
Did you guys hear that loud bang?

21:34.820 --> 21:36.800
Shit it is so late.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.390
You know sometimes I think
that I need to stand here

21:40.390 --> 21:41.933
and monitor everything you are doing

21:41.933 --> 21:44.273
or else you won't get anything done.

21:45.310 --> 21:47.140
You know Reggie you could really use

21:47.140 --> 21:50.140
some further training in
how to run a business.

21:50.140 --> 21:54.573
- Oh yeah but you could
really use a stupid asshole.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.073
I bet.

21:58.850 --> 22:00.763
- What did you say to me?

22:03.211 --> 22:05.628
(gun fires)

22:06.719 --> 22:09.469
- Mr. Jerrod, is everything okay?

22:11.071 --> 22:14.083
(moaning from television)

22:14.083 --> 22:19.083
Oh my God.
(blood splatters)

22:21.223 --> 22:24.056
(dramatic music)

22:31.630 --> 22:34.800
- We're through taking
shit from you Twatzilla.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.793
You want to bust my balls?

22:37.860 --> 22:39.543
Well you ought to be licking them.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.383
- You're making a big mistake Reggie.

22:44.220 --> 22:46.720
You know something like
this could ruin your life.

22:48.430 --> 22:50.330
Don't you wanna have a family someday?

22:51.540 --> 22:55.470
You are obviously under some
sort of extreme stress and--

22:55.470 --> 22:57.430
- Shut up douche face.

22:57.430 --> 23:00.280
I'm in charge now, no more manipulative

23:00.280 --> 23:03.423
psychobabble old lady
bullshit from you, enough.

23:04.410 --> 23:08.093
The next thing out of your
mouth better be your tongue.

23:09.376 --> 23:12.376
(suspenseful music)

23:16.907 --> 23:19.657
(inhales deeply)

23:30.470 --> 23:33.193
- Oh come on, really, really?

23:44.750 --> 23:48.100
- Lace I am so sorry.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.790
Please let us just make this up to you.

23:50.790 --> 23:52.240
- Sorry doesn't cut it chump.

23:53.267 --> 23:54.693
Now drop the gun.

23:59.730 --> 24:02.620
- Lace, I am so sorry.

24:02.620 --> 24:03.990
- You're lucky I don't
cut you a little Vienna

24:03.990 --> 24:07.710
sausages off, you
pathetic excuses for men.

24:07.710 --> 24:10.510
Looks like your libido
lied behind the barrel.

24:10.510 --> 24:12.130
Because now you got shit.

24:12.130 --> 24:14.630
- You're absolutely right Lace, were weak.

24:14.630 --> 24:16.906
Please let us make it up to you.

24:16.906 --> 24:21.906
- Oh you're gonna make it
up to me, I'll be in touch.

24:25.426 --> 24:28.643
Oh you're gonna make it up
to me alright. (laughing)

24:32.810 --> 24:34.270
- That didn't go so well.

24:34.270 --> 24:37.280
- Dude you have no backbone,
what the hell was that?

24:37.280 --> 24:38.113
- What?

24:38.113 --> 24:39.970
- Didn't you see the way I
handled things with Polly?

24:39.970 --> 24:41.340
You gotta take charge man.

24:41.340 --> 24:42.173
- Well yeah but--

24:42.173 --> 24:44.320
- Yeah but she probably
creamed your jeans.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.490
- You dropped the gun.

24:45.490 --> 24:48.530
- Oh don't blame this on me you
dropped the fucking gun too.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.600
God damn it.

24:50.810 --> 24:51.833
- What the hell?

24:54.130 --> 24:56.178
Is this how you normally
greet people around here?

24:56.178 --> 24:59.400
- Sir I am so sorry, I
didn't know you were there.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.233
Are you okay?

25:00.233 --> 25:02.493
- Boy you lucky I don't
ring your scrawny neck.

25:04.410 --> 25:05.640
- Can we help you sir?

25:05.640 --> 25:09.070
- I'm Detective Theodore
Watson, I'm investigating

25:09.070 --> 25:11.550
a young lady by the name
of Juliette Shields.

25:11.550 --> 25:13.350
I've come to understand
that she's employed

25:13.350 --> 25:15.140
at this establishment, is that correct?

25:15.140 --> 25:17.750
- Yeah we know Juliette, she
helps out here at the shop

25:17.750 --> 25:20.600
and does artwork for some
of our larger clients.

25:20.600 --> 25:24.090
- Have either of you seen
her in the past 24 hours?

25:24.090 --> 25:25.250
- No.
- No.

25:25.250 --> 25:28.903
- I mean no, she didn't show
up for work today in fact.

25:29.919 --> 25:32.970
- Does she have any
enemies that you know of?

25:32.970 --> 25:35.380
Any problems she's been
dealing with lately?

25:35.380 --> 25:36.943
- No, not that I'm aware of.

25:37.910 --> 25:39.590
- May I please have her address?

25:39.590 --> 25:41.340
Do any of you know where she lives?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.270
- I don't know if we
can just hand that over.

25:44.270 --> 25:46.690
- Are you pleading the fifth or some shit?

25:46.690 --> 25:48.880
- I'm pretty sure it's the 15th.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.980
- Yep, payroll was today.

25:50.980 --> 25:51.860
- What?

25:51.860 --> 25:54.090
- We do have her check
though if you find her.

25:54.090 --> 25:55.990
- Yeah definitely the 15th.

25:55.990 --> 25:57.283
- The fifth amendment?

26:00.650 --> 26:03.623
Are you choosing to remain
silent in my questioning?

26:07.060 --> 26:11.199
Can you please give me the
address of Miss Shields?

26:11.199 --> 26:14.366
(contemplative music)

26:19.267 --> 26:22.100
(papers rustling)

26:32.580 --> 26:33.490
Thank you.

26:33.490 --> 26:35.883
- So is she a suspect of some kind?

26:36.730 --> 26:38.410
- I'm a homicide detective.

26:38.410 --> 26:40.210
Do I have to spell out
to you what that means?

26:40.210 --> 26:44.023
- So what you're saying is, she's dead.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.920
- Did the killer leave a note or anything?

26:46.920 --> 26:47.753
- A note?

26:47.753 --> 26:49.830
- Yeah you know to take credit.

26:49.830 --> 26:52.970
- No son, the killer
didn't leave us a note.

26:52.970 --> 26:56.137
(contemplative music)

27:00.860 --> 27:01.963
I'll be watching you.

27:10.191 --> 27:12.441
(exhaling)

27:15.160 --> 27:18.140
- Dude I told you Polly
would go to the cops.

27:18.140 --> 27:20.250
- Oh bullshit this
guy's just investigating

27:20.250 --> 27:23.110
like a missing persons report
or some shit like that.

27:23.110 --> 27:25.030
- Yeah now he thinks we're involved.

27:25.030 --> 27:27.143
- What like we're gay, you wish.

27:28.327 --> 27:30.730
(grunting)

27:30.730 --> 27:34.633
- Yeah, oh that was perfect.

27:35.730 --> 27:39.160
Well, I'm gonna go whip us up some lattes.

27:39.160 --> 27:39.993
Don't you move.

27:44.490 --> 27:48.273
And don't do all that cocaine,
some seriously pure stuff.

27:56.080 --> 27:58.803
The maid forgot my fucking chia seeds!

28:05.383 --> 28:08.580
(indistinct whispering)

28:08.580 --> 28:09.483
Is someone there?

28:11.270 --> 28:14.070
Hey speak up or you're dead.

28:14.070 --> 28:15.760
I got enough firepower in this place

28:15.760 --> 28:17.410
to blow up the fucking Superdome.

28:19.540 --> 28:21.875
Don't you know I'm a T-shirt mega god?

28:21.875 --> 28:26.875
(dramatic music)
(heart beating)

29:03.710 --> 29:04.807
- Hey guys.

29:04.807 --> 29:07.140
(laughing)

29:08.839 --> 29:11.580
Yo Tee man, those brews
had me farting like

29:11.580 --> 29:14.023
a hurricane last night,
I think I blew a gasket.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.140
What are you listening to?

29:16.140 --> 29:19.020
- Oh hey bro, these two have
been acting weird as fuck

29:19.020 --> 29:21.530
all morning, so I'm listening
in on their conversation.

29:21.530 --> 29:22.363
- How.

29:22.363 --> 29:24.823
- With these, I can
hear them clear as day.

29:26.100 --> 29:27.570
Look I bugged them.

29:27.570 --> 29:31.090
I spy on everybody okay just
seriously I'll explain later.

29:31.090 --> 29:32.510
They've been talking about kidnapping,

29:32.510 --> 29:35.230
and police, and all kind
of shit this morning.

29:35.230 --> 29:36.940
- They're probably
talking about some movie.

29:36.940 --> 29:40.480
- No man, they mentioned
Juliette and Detective Watson.

29:40.480 --> 29:41.630
This shit is local ese.

29:42.680 --> 29:45.167
We should probably look busy,
so they're not on to us.

29:45.167 --> 29:46.500
- You really think they had something

29:46.500 --> 29:48.310
to do with Juliet's disappearance?

29:48.310 --> 29:50.280
I mean why would they kidnap Juliette?

29:50.280 --> 29:51.170
- Well if you remember I was

29:51.170 --> 29:52.893
telling you about their problems.

29:55.292 --> 29:56.377
- And when the gun went off a second time.

29:56.377 --> 29:59.342
- And we really are a couple of horn dogs.

29:59.342 --> 30:02.520
- Yeah we gotta chill with
that detective poking around.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.430
- These guys are psychos for sure.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.073
- Serious dude, it's getting too crazy.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.750
- Tango and Cash.

30:11.750 --> 30:12.583
- Yo.

30:12.583 --> 30:13.440
- What's up fellas?

30:13.440 --> 30:14.273
- Just chilling.

30:14.273 --> 30:15.106
- How's it going Tank?

30:15.106 --> 30:17.020
- Dreamy baby, diamonds and rust.

30:17.020 --> 30:18.587
- Hey tank, we got to try to thing

30:18.587 --> 30:19.900
we got from you last night.

30:19.900 --> 30:20.733
- Oh yeah?

30:20.733 --> 30:21.590
- Brother it is clean.

30:21.590 --> 30:23.190
- Y'all better keep it around y'all too.

30:23.190 --> 30:24.150
- Why's that?

30:24.150 --> 30:26.388
- Because she'd getting real out here.

30:26.388 --> 30:27.980
You know Hanes from Crescent City?

30:27.980 --> 30:31.040
He was choked out last night
at his bungaloo on a bayou.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.000
- What?
- What?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.400
- Came down the grapevine this morning.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.780
Watson want to keep it a secret,

30:35.780 --> 30:37.800
but ain't no secrets around here Reggie.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.907
- Yeah Watson he was here last
night asking about Juliette.

30:39.907 --> 30:42.210
- Man I'm telling you that
pretty little white meat

30:42.210 --> 30:45.900
got sliced ear to ear like
Jack the Ripper on some shit.

30:45.900 --> 30:47.310
- Dude are you hearing this?

30:47.310 --> 30:48.690
- Yeah, this is crazy.

30:48.690 --> 30:50.300
- Well what are we gonna
do aren't you scared?

30:50.300 --> 30:53.450
- Fuck no scared, I'm celebrating.

30:53.450 --> 30:54.370
Don't you know with that motherfucker

30:54.370 --> 30:56.550
gone out of the way I
could take over this bitch.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.513
Wham bam, thank you ma'am.

30:59.490 --> 31:00.323
- What's this?

31:00.323 --> 31:03.020
- That's 20 g's, now we're
going platinum, make it happen.

31:03.020 --> 31:03.853
- We will.

31:03.853 --> 31:05.410
- Fucking right you will.

31:05.410 --> 31:08.110
Always a pleasure my milk toast brothers.

31:08.110 --> 31:08.943
- Alright Tank.

31:08.943 --> 31:10.160
- [Tank] Make it happen.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.432
I'm taking over this bitch don't forget.

31:11.432 --> 31:13.810
- Dude I never did like
Hanes, fuck that dude.

31:13.810 --> 31:17.160
- At first I thought you were
nuts, but this is real shit.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.550
- It's like Tank said,
shit is getting real.

31:19.550 --> 31:20.550
- But how'd you know though?

31:20.550 --> 31:22.060
I mean you totally called it.

31:22.060 --> 31:23.720
- This has been brewing for a while.

31:23.720 --> 31:26.360
I can almost smell it, like a shark

31:26.360 --> 31:29.020
smelling blood in the ocean miles away.

31:34.090 --> 31:36.870
- Mark, these are all no good.

31:36.870 --> 31:39.290
You're gonna have to print all new ones.

31:39.290 --> 31:40.600
I can't sell these.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.370
- Well Bella what's wrong with them?

31:42.370 --> 31:45.080
- Every single one of these are off

31:45.080 --> 31:47.440
a quarter of an inch to the left.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.050
This is unacceptable.

31:49.050 --> 31:52.730
With Elegant Decay out upping their game,

31:52.730 --> 31:55.170
I can't afford any misprints.

31:55.170 --> 31:56.760
- Geez Bella these are tri-blends.

31:56.760 --> 31:59.210
This ain't gonna be cheap,
how many we talking?

31:59.210 --> 32:01.720
- There's this box, and my
daughter's bring in another.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.107
- Dude prepare for an erection.

32:04.107 --> 32:06.774
(upbeat music)

32:28.990 --> 32:32.270
- Mark, you're going to have
to replace all of these.

32:32.270 --> 32:34.380
- Wow Bella, that's over 600 bucks.

32:34.380 --> 32:36.140
- You should have thought of
that before you let Poncho

32:36.140 --> 32:38.493
print everything off quarter of an inch.

32:39.370 --> 32:41.824
- You don't know.
- You should see the website.

32:41.824 --> 32:43.640
Every summer I wax my beef
to the beach wear page.

32:43.640 --> 32:44.480
- Come on save it.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.103
- Sorry, sorry.

32:47.050 --> 32:48.430
- You know you guys aren't being very

32:48.430 --> 32:50.759
discreet with your perverted staring.

32:50.759 --> 32:51.870
- You don't have to be jealous Heather.

32:51.870 --> 32:53.370
You know you're my number one.

32:57.610 --> 32:58.873
- She's an overdose.

32:59.710 --> 33:02.343
But it's pretty clear this
guy back here was murdered.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.240
- She could have killed
him and then just came

33:05.240 --> 33:07.403
back here for too many celebratory snorts.

33:09.270 --> 33:11.120
- What about the cryptic note though?

33:12.010 --> 33:14.220
Fuck you know what, the
killer left a fucking note.

33:14.220 --> 33:16.535
- Andre, can I get that note back?

33:16.535 --> 33:17.817
Thank you.

33:19.531 --> 33:20.364
This was just on top of the body.

33:20.364 --> 33:22.090
It's not like it fell out of
his underwear or something.

33:22.090 --> 33:26.030
- She didn't leave that
note, but this is a clue.

33:26.030 --> 33:29.200
I want all information on
everybody at that print shop.

33:29.200 --> 33:32.266
All of the receipts,
everything you can get me.

33:32.266 --> 33:33.320
There's something fishy going on here.

33:33.320 --> 33:34.920
We're gonna sniff this shit out.

33:36.589 --> 33:38.777
- So you like spy on everybody?

33:38.777 --> 33:39.610
- Well,

33:41.280 --> 33:42.453
it's kind of my thing.

33:43.937 --> 33:45.230
You know don't tell nobody but

33:45.230 --> 33:47.793
I find other people's
lives really interesting.

33:48.750 --> 33:50.000
So I watch them.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.560
- And listen to them.

33:51.560 --> 33:52.683
- Pretty clever huh?

33:53.550 --> 33:55.800
Who new bugging people
could be so much fun?

33:55.800 --> 33:56.760
- Really?

33:56.760 --> 33:59.760
- Yeah and I pick it all up on
this little scoot right here.

34:00.649 --> 34:03.300
I can hear them 1000
feet away, clear as day.

34:03.300 --> 34:06.600
- So you like listen to Mark
in the bathroom and shit?

34:06.600 --> 34:10.700
- No man no, none of that,
did you ever want to hear

34:10.700 --> 34:12.857
what people say when you're not around?

34:14.389 --> 34:15.222
Well I know.

34:16.450 --> 34:19.050
- Whatever man, you think too much.

34:19.050 --> 34:21.113
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.180
Either way my spying here is gonna help us

34:24.180 --> 34:26.820
get to the bottom of this T-shirt warfare.

34:26.820 --> 34:29.480
- You know I often thought that
eliminating the competition

34:29.480 --> 34:32.300
is a way to make a
business assure success.

34:32.300 --> 34:35.240
If you're right, this is
T-shirt warfare, I admire

34:35.240 --> 34:37.913
the attackers strategy, I
think there's more to come.

34:39.750 --> 34:42.460
- And that motherfucker right
there is our first suspect.

34:42.460 --> 34:43.750
- Seriously.

34:43.750 --> 34:46.090
- So Art, you do photography right?

34:46.090 --> 34:48.360
- Oh yeah, quite a bit actually, why?

34:48.360 --> 34:50.530
- Well Bella's talking
about needing somebody ASAP

34:50.530 --> 34:53.140
to help her get a new line
of shirts live tonight.

34:53.140 --> 34:55.320
Would you be interested
in something like that?

34:55.320 --> 34:56.540
- Sure, I can do that.

34:56.540 --> 34:57.390
- She'll pay you.

34:58.412 --> 35:00.320
- Sounds great Mark, thanks.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.820
- Great, I'll let her know.

35:01.820 --> 35:03.720
- Dude do you realize what just happened?

35:03.720 --> 35:04.553
- What?

35:04.553 --> 35:05.870
- He just asked you if
you want to photograph

35:05.870 --> 35:09.353
Cammi half naked, and get
paid for it, and you said yes.

35:10.300 --> 35:11.730
- Oh choice, that's right you said

35:11.730 --> 35:14.503
she models all her mom's
clothes, holy shit.

36:23.010 --> 36:25.060

Mark actually said you

36:30.650 --> 36:33.350

photographs for quite a while now.

36:33.350 --> 36:37.673

36:49.020 --> 36:49.853
- Cammi is behind the curtain.

36:49.853 --> 36:51.610
She'll let you know what you need to do.

36:51.610 --> 36:54.750
I have to attend a meeting,
then go to the market.

36:54.750 --> 36:56.850
You should be done by the time I get back.

36:57.890 --> 37:02.283
Just upload all the files
to my email on the website.

37:04.737 --> 37:06.800

37:27.270 --> 37:28.770
- Oh great, I'll be right out.

37:35.150 --> 37:37.460

37:37.460 --> 37:39.890
- Yeah, I saw you too.

37:39.890 --> 37:42.010
We didn't get to officially meet, I'm Art.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.680
- I'm Cammi, nice to meet you.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.510
Thanks so much for doing
this on short notice.

37:45.510 --> 37:47.720
We're really in a rush
to get this line going.

37:47.720 --> 37:50.623
- Yeah, no problem,
it's my pleasure really.

37:51.985 --> 37:54.210
When I saw you today I was
hoping I'd get to meet you.

37:54.210 --> 37:56.243
- Yeah, why is that?

37:56.243 --> 37:59.083
- I don't know I just
thought we had a connection.

38:00.177 --> 38:02.870
- Me too actually.

38:02.870 --> 38:05.457
- Alright well, you ready to get started?

38:05.457 --> 38:07.124

♪ Do you want to love me in the night ♪

38:53.395 --> 38:56.605
♪ Do you still love ♪

38:56.605 --> 39:01.105
♪ Tell my you're gonna treat me right ♪

39:06.430 --> 39:08.370
- So did you get to fish
in her canal or what?

39:08.370 --> 39:10.450
- No, but we made a strong connection.

39:10.450 --> 39:11.810
She wants me to call her this weekend

39:11.810 --> 39:13.890
to make out, to hang out.

39:13.890 --> 39:16.950
- Wow, man that is really awesome for you.

39:16.950 --> 39:18.450
She usually isn't very flirty.

39:19.300 --> 39:20.770
- So what's all this stuff?

39:20.770 --> 39:23.110
- Here we have all the local
independent clothing companies

39:23.110 --> 39:25.760
along with the employees
of our pals print shop.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.340
- That's what I'm talking
about, excellent let's hear it.

39:28.340 --> 39:29.560
- Dude while you were playing herb rits

39:29.560 --> 39:31.520
with Cammi I have been busy.

39:31.520 --> 39:34.220
I made a sheet for every
suspect in our circle.

39:34.220 --> 39:35.830
- Geez, you have been busy.

39:35.830 --> 39:37.050
- First is Henly.

39:37.050 --> 39:39.500
- This guy seems like a prime suspect,

39:39.500 --> 39:42.350
relocated here from Rhode
Island six months ago.

39:42.350 --> 39:44.300
He was Juliet's coworker.

39:44.300 --> 39:45.480
Three months ago he got picked up

39:45.480 --> 39:47.380
for soliciting, looks like a real asshole.

39:47.380 --> 39:49.370
- The guy comes into town
all of a sudden and then

39:49.370 --> 39:52.110
wants to make this T-shirt
line with bear dicks.

39:52.110 --> 39:54.570
- You really think he
killed Juliette and Hanes?

39:54.570 --> 39:56.100
- I wouldn't put it past him.

39:56.100 --> 39:57.620
Next up we have Mark and Reggie.

39:57.620 --> 40:00.220
- These two bozos are right
in the middle of everything.

40:00.220 --> 40:01.783
- Plus there's a possibility we're

40:01.783 --> 40:03.137
dealing with more than one killer.

40:03.137 --> 40:04.440
- The shit these guys we're talking

40:04.440 --> 40:07.010
about today was basically a confession.

40:07.010 --> 40:09.360
They're like two unabombers
waiting to explode.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.680
Next up is Tank.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.390
- Seems like a killer to me.

40:13.390 --> 40:14.663
- Why 'cause he's black?

40:15.840 --> 40:17.040
- No I just--

40:17.040 --> 40:20.450
- Samuel Bartholomew
Dangerfield, aka Tank.

40:20.450 --> 40:23.010
This guy's got a rap sheet a mile long,

40:23.010 --> 40:25.480
over a dozen murder charges all dismissed.

40:25.480 --> 40:26.670
- Couldn't tell you how many times

40:26.670 --> 40:28.520
I've taken this hoodlum in.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.290
The moment something
links him to this case

40:30.290 --> 40:32.310
I'm throwing the fucking book at his ass.

40:32.310 --> 40:35.020
- Distributing, assault
and battery, arson.

40:35.020 --> 40:37.019
- Next up we have Poncho.

40:37.019 --> 40:38.900
- Are you kidding, Poncho?

40:38.900 --> 40:40.990
- The guy never says shit, it's eerie.

40:40.990 --> 40:44.750
- He hardly speaks English,
Poncho is harmless.

40:44.750 --> 40:46.010
- We'll see about that.

40:46.010 --> 40:47.150
- [Sax] He was found naked inside

40:47.150 --> 40:48.850
of a crypt covered in his own urine.

40:48.850 --> 40:50.800
- Next we got Lace and Bella.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.000
They used to work together
years ago and then

40:53.000 --> 40:54.490
their relationship went sour and they

40:54.490 --> 40:56.580
ended up having an ugly separation.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.140
- This clipping's from The Times, 1988.

40:59.140 --> 41:01.330
For years they were sharing
a residency and a printing

41:01.330 --> 41:04.500
business until their court
settlement in the early 90's.

41:04.500 --> 41:06.160
Both have charges for assault.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.403
- Ugly separation?

41:08.970 --> 41:12.300
- Yeah the two can't stand to
be in the same room together.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.833
- Really, look who just sat down.

41:17.770 --> 41:19.223
- Something is off here dude.

41:20.110 --> 41:21.963
- Wait a minute, I'm a suspect?

41:22.830 --> 41:25.040
- Well technically, yeah.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.140
- Well what about you?

41:27.340 --> 41:28.464
- I would know if I was the killer.

41:28.464 --> 41:30.650
- [Sax] this guy also works at the shop.

41:30.650 --> 41:32.610
- Tee, that's my boy, he alright.

41:32.610 --> 41:33.800
- You know this dude?

41:33.800 --> 41:37.520
- Yep, the CI from five years ago.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.730
Slacker, but a stand up guy.

41:39.730 --> 41:40.677
Our main focus should be on

41:40.677 --> 41:42.953
the print shop and
those suspicious owners.

41:43.840 --> 41:47.103
Think I'm gonna pay them a visit
tonight, see what stirring.

41:47.970 --> 41:50.222
- Lace, I know you said
you'd never forgive me but

41:50.222 --> 41:53.200
I was hoping that we could put
old problems aside for now.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.120
- What do you want?

41:54.120 --> 41:56.510
I can't even believe I'm
sitting here with you right now.

41:56.510 --> 41:59.403
- I think that someone's out to get us.

42:00.722 --> 42:03.560
- What because of Hanes?

42:03.560 --> 42:06.030
Please, that guy was a scumbag.

42:06.030 --> 42:08.700
He probably had half the
city gunning for him.

42:08.700 --> 42:11.238
He was a nagan supporter you know.

42:11.238 --> 42:15.653
- This is serious, first
Juliette now Hanes.

42:16.530 --> 42:19.310
I think someone's out
to get one of us next.

42:20.416 --> 42:21.249
- What are you doing?

42:21.249 --> 42:22.570
- I've got a bug on Bella.

42:22.570 --> 42:24.814
Let's see what these old
coots are talking about.

42:24.814 --> 42:26.530
- Alright let's just say for a minute

42:26.530 --> 42:29.500
that someone is out to get us, why?

42:29.500 --> 42:32.960
- Because our business is cutthroat,

42:32.960 --> 42:36.000
and now someone's taking
that term literally.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.660
Poor Juliette was the sweetest
girl that I've ever known.

42:39.660 --> 42:42.500
She was killed because of her position.

42:42.500 --> 42:44.200
- I remember our old positions.

42:44.200 --> 42:45.710
- Scissor Lips.

42:45.710 --> 42:46.951
- Whoa.

42:46.951 --> 42:48.170
- Dude Lace totally just
changed the subject.

42:48.170 --> 42:49.440
- You can say that again.

42:49.440 --> 42:52.453
- Would you come stay with
me at my home tonight?

42:53.990 --> 42:55.030
Protect me.

42:55.030 --> 42:56.780
- I don't want to want to
open that old wound again.

42:56.780 --> 42:58.790
- Geez, keep it shut lady.

42:58.790 --> 43:00.006
- No I think she means.

43:00.006 --> 43:03.290
- Shit, you see how nervous I am?

43:03.290 --> 43:05.593
- Ah shit, there goes the bug.

43:06.940 --> 43:08.740
Look I think we should
follow Lace tonight.

43:08.740 --> 43:10.930
I think something juicy is gonna happen.

43:10.930 --> 43:12.530
- If it'll make you feel better.

43:15.980 --> 43:18.510
- Man, Lace is gonna run us into

43:18.510 --> 43:21.430
the ground for this, I can tell.

43:21.430 --> 43:24.130
- Well maybe you should
have let me handle her.

43:24.130 --> 43:25.510
Instead you're too busy playing

43:25.510 --> 43:28.090
bedtime baby nurses for nanny.

43:28.090 --> 43:30.174
- Funny you say that, I did feel like

43:30.174 --> 43:31.390
a little baby when I was
suckling on her booby.

43:31.390 --> 43:33.220
- God damn it this fucking stupid thing.

43:33.220 --> 43:34.183
Why won't it fit?

43:35.930 --> 43:39.003
- Man, look at all this cash dude.

43:42.860 --> 43:46.670
We could just skip town, pick
up whores, and go to Vegas.

43:46.670 --> 43:48.170
- Tank would find us for sure.

43:49.851 --> 43:52.710
- My associate and I would like a bottle

43:52.710 --> 43:57.380
of your finest bubbly sir,
and four hair pies please.

43:57.380 --> 43:58.668
- Shit!

43:58.668 --> 44:00.040
(metal banging)

44:00.040 --> 44:02.180
Detective Watson I am so--

44:02.180 --> 44:05.203
- Sorry, you gonna be sorry alright.

44:06.910 --> 44:09.360
What the hell are you
cracker jacks doing in here?

44:09.360 --> 44:12.003
You better come clean
with me too, spill it.

44:13.590 --> 44:15.480
- This is actually for a large order sir.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.750
We were just playing around.

44:16.750 --> 44:18.170
- Well I'm not.

44:18.170 --> 44:21.310
You just lost an employee,
and your best customer,

44:21.310 --> 44:23.900
and you guys are in here playing around?

44:23.900 --> 44:26.900
You better pray no one else
linked to this please dies

44:26.900 --> 44:29.930
or I won't hesitate lock
your pansy asses up.

44:29.930 --> 44:32.437
- Absolutely sir, this is
a dark time for us here.

44:32.437 --> 44:34.710
- I'd like to have a look at all invoices

44:34.710 --> 44:36.430
dealing with Crescent City Clothing.

44:36.430 --> 44:37.430
- Not a problem sir.

44:37.430 --> 44:38.780
- We're very cooperative by nature.

44:38.780 --> 44:40.240
- Please.

44:40.240 --> 44:41.770
Just get the information together,

44:41.770 --> 44:44.560
drop it off at second district station.

44:44.560 --> 44:47.393
And this won't be the end of
our acquaintance gentlemen.

44:55.380 --> 44:56.550
- What a dick.

44:56.550 --> 44:59.500
- Serious, what does he want
us to solve the crime for him?

45:01.279 --> 45:04.819
(suspenseful music)

45:04.819 --> 45:08.403
- Alright come on, bedroom's back here.

45:08.403 --> 45:11.486
(suspenseful music)

45:18.130 --> 45:20.810
- Let's get out of here, she's no killer.

45:20.810 --> 45:22.860
- Wait I want to see what she does.

45:22.860 --> 45:24.723
- Dreams of Scissor Lips I'm sure.

45:25.860 --> 45:28.493
- No way man, old ladies don't masturbate.

45:31.248 --> 45:34.369
- Yeah, they do.

45:34.369 --> 45:35.930
- You gotta be kidding me.

45:35.930 --> 45:37.640
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

45:40.670 --> 45:43.753
(suspenseful music)

47:40.573 --> 47:41.573
- Fuck this.

47:43.969 --> 47:47.446
(evil laughter)

47:47.446 --> 47:50.446
(suspenseful music)

48:20.373 --> 48:23.123
(dramatic music)

50:40.726 --> 50:43.643
Why don't you just kill me already?

50:47.159 --> 50:50.159
(screaming in pain)

51:25.570 --> 51:26.953
- Well now the first note makes sense.

51:28.302 --> 51:30.102
You gotta be kidding me?

51:30.102 --> 51:31.137
- What the fuck going on man?

51:31.137 --> 51:33.340
You blue suit wearing bologna
pussy eating mother fuckers.

51:33.340 --> 51:34.880
You think I wasted this bitch?

51:34.880 --> 51:36.385
I ain't kill that which bitch.

51:36.385 --> 51:37.538
She ain't no threat.

51:37.538 --> 51:40.766
You ain't neither mother
fucker, you ain't shit.

51:40.766 --> 51:42.266
- Sit your ass down.

51:42.266 --> 51:43.099
- Man let me go.

51:43.099 --> 51:44.320
- Sit down.

51:44.320 --> 51:45.730
- Oh great.

51:45.730 --> 51:47.460
- Calm down brother, this white bitch was

51:47.460 --> 51:50.840
found dead on your property,
so we got to take you in.

51:50.840 --> 51:52.640
- What do you mean she
was found, say bro--

51:52.640 --> 51:54.900
- Anyway, she ain't white no more,

51:54.900 --> 51:56.440
she was skinned from head to toe.

51:56.440 --> 51:57.940
- What that got to do with me?

51:57.940 --> 51:59.700
- I don't think you did it.

51:59.700 --> 52:01.230
I think someone trying to set you up.

52:01.230 --> 52:02.360
- You know I ain't do it.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.910
- So just calm down and tell
us what we want to know.

52:04.910 --> 52:07.753
- I ain't saying shit till
I get some representation.

52:08.830 --> 52:10.000
- Have it your way.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.710
- What are you king of
burgers or some shit?

52:11.710 --> 52:15.400
- What can you tell me
about the screen print shop?

52:15.400 --> 52:18.523
Especially the pecker woods that run it.

52:18.523 --> 52:20.820
- No it's no problem, don't worry about.

52:20.820 --> 52:22.153
It happens, thanks.

52:23.320 --> 52:24.153
Here you go man.

52:25.900 --> 52:27.370
Fucking piece of shit.

52:27.370 --> 52:29.463
My order gets fucked up everywhere I go.

52:31.646 --> 52:32.479
You know what fuck it.

52:32.479 --> 52:34.050
I'm not gonna let anything ruin this day.

52:35.590 --> 52:37.826
- Hi mate, can you spare a fag?

52:37.826 --> 52:38.860
- What'd you call me?

52:38.860 --> 52:40.870
- I think she means a cigarette.

52:40.870 --> 52:43.130
- Oh right, sorry here you go.

52:43.130 --> 52:43.963
- Sweet mate.

52:43.963 --> 52:44.796
- [Reggie] Nice shirt.

52:48.550 --> 52:50.223
- Goddamn bums man.

52:51.270 --> 52:54.320
- Do you think Elegant Decay
is who's behind these murders?

52:54.320 --> 52:57.170
- Maybe, nobody seems to
know who's behind company.

52:57.170 --> 52:59.580
- Yeah, and they're the
newest kid on the block.

52:59.580 --> 53:01.970
And the oldest just got knocked off.

53:01.970 --> 53:03.210
- Coincidence?

53:03.210 --> 53:04.450
- And as a potential where next

53:04.450 --> 53:07.000
because we're the supplier
for all the competitors.

53:11.926 --> 53:12.843
- Doubt it.

53:13.788 --> 53:16.871
(suspenseful music)

53:19.626 --> 53:24.376
- So the breakfast of champions,
a roast beef and coffee?

53:25.894 --> 53:29.890
I saw Andre out front, said
Tanks alibi checks out.

53:29.890 --> 53:31.850
- He said that today, but I'll think

53:31.850 --> 53:33.450
of something to hold him anyway.

53:34.610 --> 53:37.080
Good to know he's off the street though.

53:37.080 --> 53:38.930
- How do you eat so heavily so early?

53:39.998 --> 53:43.350
- Yeah I'm headed to that
shop, you wanna tag along?

53:43.350 --> 53:45.980
- We just got off a graveyard.

53:45.980 --> 53:47.360
Why don't you just go home
and get some sleep boss?

53:47.360 --> 53:49.899
Why you so hung up on these
dicks at the print shop?

53:49.899 --> 53:51.596
- So you saying they ain't
got nothing to do with this?

53:51.596 --> 53:53.160
- I'm not saying they have
nothing to do it, I'm just saying

53:53.160 --> 53:56.773
isn't there a possibility
they're just assholes?

53:57.699 --> 54:01.650
I mean why don't we just take
a step back and look at this?

54:02.756 --> 54:05.756
(suspenseful music)

54:13.116 --> 54:14.310
This little piggy had roast beef.

54:14.310 --> 54:15.803
- Sure do.

54:17.210 --> 54:18.533
- It's the notes boss.

54:20.760 --> 54:23.330
Bella's coming back from the market right?

54:23.330 --> 54:27.323
And Hanes was killed in his
home, just like the notes.

54:28.930 --> 54:31.230
So if this killers
following this stupid rhyme

54:31.230 --> 54:34.483
then we have like three
more murders to go boss.

54:35.649 --> 54:36.980
- Then tonight's gonna be a bloodbath.

54:36.980 --> 54:39.251
We got to find this son of a bitch.

54:39.251 --> 54:41.810
- There's something we're not
catching here with the notes.

54:41.810 --> 54:44.870
- Yeah, they're being printed at the shop.

54:44.870 --> 54:46.700
They could have worked there Sax.

54:46.700 --> 54:49.400
The notes have been
silkscreened into the fabric.

54:49.400 --> 54:51.970
All we have to do is find the printer.

54:51.970 --> 54:54.170
- So you want to full DNA test the notes?

54:54.170 --> 54:58.120
- Yep, and in the meantime
I'm gonna go old school.

54:58.120 --> 55:00.573
There at the shop and I'm on my way.

55:01.900 --> 55:03.350
- This little piggy had none.

55:17.128 --> 55:20.660
- Holy shit dude, shit
is going down in there.

55:20.660 --> 55:21.530
- What's happening man?

55:21.530 --> 55:23.730
- That Detective is here
talking to Mark and Reggie.

55:23.730 --> 55:25.390
He thinks they have something
to do with the murders.

55:25.390 --> 55:27.060
And it sounds like
somebody else got diced?

55:27.060 --> 55:28.520
- What, who?

55:28.520 --> 55:29.510
- I don't know, I just overheard

55:29.510 --> 55:31.828
them talking about a third victim.

55:31.828 --> 55:32.980
(phone ringing)

55:32.980 --> 55:35.023
- Hey it's Cammi, hold on a second.

55:36.170 --> 55:37.620
- Hey Cammi, what's going on?

55:37.620 --> 55:39.060
I'm just about to head in to work.

55:39.060 --> 55:41.050
- [Cammi] I didn't know who else to call.

55:41.050 --> 55:43.740
- Oh no hey, I'm here
for you, what's going on?

55:43.740 --> 55:44.653
- [Cammi] My mom.

55:45.940 --> 55:48.542
- No it's okay you can tell me.

55:48.542 --> 55:49.880
- [Cammi] She's been murdered.

55:49.880 --> 55:52.638
The police woke me up
first thing this morning.

55:52.638 --> 55:55.210
I don't know what's going on.

55:55.210 --> 55:56.400
I need to get out of here.

55:56.400 --> 55:58.550
- Okay, I'll come pick you up.

55:58.550 --> 56:00.738
Just calm down, tell me where you are.

56:00.738 --> 56:02.040
- [Cammi] I'm at the station on Broad.

56:02.040 --> 56:02.930
Thank you so much Art.

56:02.930 --> 56:07.562
I know we just but you
really are sweet and--

56:07.562 --> 56:09.833
- No it's no big deal, I'll be there soon.

56:11.390 --> 56:12.223
Bella's dead.

56:12.223 --> 56:13.270
- What?

56:13.270 --> 56:15.360
- Dude you got to jump on Cammi man.

56:15.360 --> 56:16.950
Chicks are always horny
when they're upset.

56:16.950 --> 56:18.340
- Seriously dude?

56:18.340 --> 56:19.910
- Well they are I think.

56:19.910 --> 56:22.270
- Alright can you cover
for me here, I gotta split.

56:22.270 --> 56:23.230
- Yeah no problem.

56:23.230 --> 56:24.390
I mean they have their
hands full in there.

56:24.390 --> 56:26.320
They probably won't even
notice that you're gone.

56:26.320 --> 56:29.010
- And Tee, I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

56:29.010 --> 56:30.690
I'm with you 100% from now on.

56:30.690 --> 56:33.620
- Fucking right brohemian,
it's coming down to it.

56:33.620 --> 56:35.720
And I know you're cool
because I bugged you too.

56:35.720 --> 56:36.860
- What?

56:36.860 --> 56:38.670
- Yeah remember those little USB pens?

56:38.670 --> 56:41.870
Well I kind of remodeled them
to host bluetooth transmitters

56:41.870 --> 56:44.120
I just needed to know that
you were on the level bro.

56:44.120 --> 56:45.237
- Geez you're good.

56:45.237 --> 56:46.710
- Now go take care of Cammi.

56:46.710 --> 56:48.500
I'll find out what
information Watson knows.

56:48.500 --> 56:50.180
- Sounds good, keep in touch.

56:50.180 --> 56:51.680
- I'll tell you the big deal.

56:51.680 --> 56:53.868
I got bodies popping up left and right.

56:53.868 --> 56:56.410
And somehow it all
point back to your shop.

56:56.410 --> 57:00.380
- You're right you're
totally right, I'm sorry.

57:00.380 --> 57:04.120
- Now enough of this
why you ask me bullshit.

57:04.120 --> 57:08.370
- Absolutely bro, I mean sir,
you have my full cooperation.

57:08.370 --> 57:10.960
I asked you nicely last
night, and I would have been

57:10.960 --> 57:15.080
very pleased if I had got
a certain stack of invoices

57:15.080 --> 57:16.620
pertaining to Crescent City Clothing

57:16.620 --> 57:19.240
delivered to my office this morning.

57:19.240 --> 57:20.590
But that just didn't happen.

57:20.590 --> 57:22.260
- We are terribly sorry about that sir,

57:22.260 --> 57:23.853
and we can get those for you.

57:24.860 --> 57:26.750
- Don't you need like a
warrant or something man?

57:26.750 --> 57:28.963
- Oh goddamn.

57:30.040 --> 57:33.366
Tee I don't know how you
work for this asshole.

57:33.366 --> 57:36.533
(contemplative music)

57:46.540 --> 57:48.867
- Make like a twirling lawnmower bro.

58:06.330 --> 58:10.230
- Man, that was pretty
tough what you just did.

58:10.230 --> 58:12.070
- Man these cops don't know me.

58:12.070 --> 58:14.200
- What if he gets a warrant though?

58:14.200 --> 58:16.420
- Geez man did you fart?

58:16.420 --> 58:18.460
It's like a fucking septic tank exploded.

58:18.460 --> 58:19.440
- I don't know.

58:19.440 --> 58:22.390
Don't give me that shit, I know
what your farts smell like.

58:24.250 --> 58:28.003
- Oh, what is that smell?

58:30.186 --> 58:32.850
- Smells like somebody
opened a morgue sandwich.

58:32.850 --> 58:34.500
Clear the deck.

58:34.500 --> 58:36.350
Yo Ponch, you catch that whiff?

58:36.350 --> 58:38.173
Smells like a maggot po boy in here.

58:39.360 --> 58:40.323
- You don't know.

58:41.680 --> 58:43.330
- Why do you always say that man?

58:44.480 --> 58:46.450
You think I don't know stuff?

58:46.450 --> 58:48.750
I know lots of things.

58:48.750 --> 58:50.563
I know lots of things.

59:00.006 --> 59:02.756
(dramatic music)

59:04.000 --> 59:06.430
- Who can it be, it's driving me crazy.

59:06.430 --> 59:10.480
- My mom was going on about
this new competitor in town.

59:10.480 --> 59:12.260
She was scared to be alone.

59:12.260 --> 59:14.150
She thought someone was out to get her.

59:14.150 --> 59:16.510
- This Elegant Decay person or whatever?

59:16.510 --> 59:18.050
- Yes.

59:18.050 --> 59:19.490
I have no idea what's going on.

59:19.490 --> 59:22.193
I just don't think I
should be alone right now.

59:23.300 --> 59:24.763
- We could go to my place.

59:26.470 --> 59:27.313
- Thanks Art.

59:29.303 --> 59:30.770
I don't think I could go home.

59:30.770 --> 59:32.920
My mom and I really
were two peas in a pod.

59:34.716 --> 59:36.333
I don't know what I'm gonna do now.

59:48.354 --> 59:50.498
- Don't worry about the mess.

59:50.498 --> 59:52.790
Just come join me, hold me.

59:52.790 --> 59:54.177
- Yeah sure.

59:54.177 --> 59:56.970
I just thought you might
want to get some rest.

59:56.970 --> 59:57.803
- Come here.

1:00:03.806 --> 1:00:06.389
(sultry music)

1:00:12.294 --> 1:00:14.573
I can't thank you enough
for being here for me.

1:00:14.573 --> 1:00:16.023
You make me feel really safe.

1:00:17.060 --> 1:00:21.516
- Anything you need Cammi,
I really care about you.

1:00:21.516 --> 1:00:25.099
- Yeah, that means a
lot I really like you.

1:00:27.394 --> 1:00:29.977
(sultry music)

1:00:39.650 --> 1:00:43.193
- I guess Tee really did know
what he was talking about.

1:00:43.193 --> 1:00:45.776
(sultry music)

1:01:36.110 --> 1:01:37.570
- Yes Mrs. Wang, so I'll send over

1:01:37.570 --> 1:01:39.283
the football wifebeaters ASAP.

1:01:42.113 --> 1:01:45.180
Right, I'll talk to you later.

1:01:45.180 --> 1:01:47.573
- Polly hey, I was
hoping to see you today.

1:01:48.789 --> 1:01:50.660
- I'm sorry for popping
in on you like this Marcus

1:01:50.660 --> 1:01:52.800
but I just really wanted to see you.

1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:55.080
- Oh it's okay Polly, what's on your mind?

1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:58.290
- Well I can't stop thinking about

1:01:58.290 --> 1:01:59.940
your behavior the other day.

1:01:59.940 --> 1:02:01.200
- Oh I'm really sorry about that.

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:03.913
- No no, no I liked.

1:02:04.825 --> 1:02:07.121
I didn't know you were so tough.

1:02:07.121 --> 1:02:08.653
- You know how it is.

1:02:09.820 --> 1:02:12.620
- Perhaps we could get
together later tonight?

1:02:12.620 --> 1:02:13.923
- Yeah sure, okay.

1:02:15.581 --> 1:02:17.440
- I want you to tie me
up again and breathe

1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:20.590
your doggie breath all
over me, like an animal.

1:02:20.590 --> 1:02:22.149
- These mothers are sick.

1:02:22.149 --> 1:02:23.400
- What that?

1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:26.193
- Nothing, I was just
listening to a really sic song.

1:02:27.770 --> 1:02:31.690
So Heather we've known each
other a few weeks now right?

1:02:31.690 --> 1:02:33.250
- Right.

1:02:33.250 --> 1:02:35.700
- And you know how much I like you right?

1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:37.790
- I guess so, sometimes it's hard to tell

1:02:37.790 --> 1:02:38.910
what's real and what's goofing off.

1:02:38.910 --> 1:02:41.140
- Well I'm not goofing now.

1:02:41.140 --> 1:02:42.210
What if I told you I want to be

1:02:42.210 --> 1:02:44.493
with you tonight for your own protection?

1:02:45.769 --> 1:02:47.629
- It's a good line but--

1:02:47.629 --> 1:02:49.423
- What if I told you
your life was in danger?

1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:53.560
- Me, who would want to hurt me?

1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:56.950
- Look you can't rationalize
the actions of an insane person

1:02:56.950 --> 1:02:58.450
I think whoever's been killing people

1:02:58.450 --> 1:03:01.815
with ties to our shop is insane.

1:03:01.815 --> 1:03:04.113
- You're being serious aren't you?

1:03:08.130 --> 1:03:09.863
- Dead serious.

1:03:09.863 --> 1:03:12.730
(phone ringing)

1:03:12.730 --> 1:03:13.830
- Big easy prints.

1:03:13.830 --> 1:03:15.053
- Hello there meat.

1:03:16.050 --> 1:03:17.710
- Oh Lace, hey how's it going?

1:03:17.710 --> 1:03:20.640
- It's gonna be going a
lot better very shortly.

1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:22.060
- Yeah why's that?

1:03:22.060 --> 1:03:23.830
- 'Cause I finally figured
out how you're gonna

1:03:23.830 --> 1:03:26.330
pay me back for your little
stunt the other night.

1:03:27.459 --> 1:03:28.292
- Stunt?

1:03:28.292 --> 1:03:32.070
- Yeah meat, you're gonna
be my slave tonight.

1:03:32.070 --> 1:03:35.220
I'm gonna show you just
how tender you can be,

1:03:35.220 --> 1:03:39.513
like a flank steak, so juicy.

1:03:40.430 --> 1:03:43.460
You still there meat?

1:03:43.460 --> 1:03:46.000
- Yeah sure Lace, that sounds like a plan.

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.440
- Be at my place tonight
or I'll butterfly you.

1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:51.920
- Okay Lace we can work with that.

1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:53.793
Thank you very much, bye bye.

1:03:54.940 --> 1:03:56.470
- So Reg man I gotta make like

1:03:56.470 --> 1:03:58.770
Rosie O'Donnell's inseam and split.

1:03:58.770 --> 1:04:00.640
Polly needs a little after hours

1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:02.410
assistance if you know what I mean.

1:04:02.410 --> 1:04:03.930
Can you lock up man?

1:04:03.930 --> 1:04:06.710
- Actually I have an
appointment with Lace tonight.

1:04:06.710 --> 1:04:10.263
- Oh nice man. (whistling)

1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:14.530
Take it easy man.

1:04:14.530 --> 1:04:16.340
- Tee can you lock up,
gotta make that move.

1:04:16.340 --> 1:04:17.985
- Well I kinda have a lot--

1:04:17.985 --> 1:04:18.818
- Make sure nobody fucks with Tanks money.

1:04:18.818 --> 1:04:21.390
Poncha you guys stay late
and finish the orders, later.

1:04:24.950 --> 1:04:27.150
- Damn, everybody's
getting lucky except me.

1:04:30.500 --> 1:04:33.030
- So Heather, have you thought about

1:04:33.030 --> 1:04:35.380
what I was telling you earlier?

1:04:35.380 --> 1:04:39.010
- Tee, I think you're sweet
and I really appreciate

1:04:39.010 --> 1:04:41.390
the concern but I get the feeling that

1:04:41.390 --> 1:04:42.860
you're just trying to get into my pants,

1:04:42.860 --> 1:04:45.810
and I just don't think
of you that way okay.

1:04:45.810 --> 1:04:48.620
- Really, we'll see how you feel

1:04:48.620 --> 1:04:50.220
when the killer gets you next.

1:04:50.220 --> 1:04:52.520
You're gonna wish I was
there to protect you.

1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:53.353
- Tee?

1:04:53.353 --> 1:04:54.690
- [Tee] Whatever I'm outta here.

1:04:54.690 --> 1:04:55.990
- Don't act like this.

1:04:55.990 --> 1:04:57.780
- Hey Poncho, can you lock up?

1:04:57.780 --> 1:04:58.743
- You don't know.

1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:02.413
- I've got a killer to catch.

1:05:47.340 --> 1:05:48.240
Shit is fucked.

1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:50.400
- What do we do, they're
gonna be prime targets.

1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:53.220
- Look you go to Lace's
you know where it's at.

1:05:53.220 --> 1:05:54.790
And I'll go to Polly's.

1:05:54.790 --> 1:05:56.580
- Alright cool I'm heading straight over.

1:05:56.580 --> 1:05:58.180
- I just hope it's not too late.

1:06:00.786 --> 1:06:03.786
(suspenseful music)

1:06:08.009 --> 1:06:11.092
(mimics dog barking)

1:06:14.297 --> 1:06:17.297
(suspenseful music)

1:06:53.976 --> 1:06:56.726
(dramatic music)

1:06:59.260 --> 1:07:01.550
- Animal enough for you Polly?

1:07:01.550 --> 1:07:04.010
- Yeah Marcus, you're a beast.

1:07:08.013 --> 1:07:10.883
You're the best of the beasts.

1:07:10.883 --> 1:07:13.633
(dramatic music)

1:07:16.413 --> 1:07:18.163
Oh Marcus be with me.

1:07:19.213 --> 1:07:21.046
- God I feel so alive.

1:07:22.905 --> 1:07:25.572
(loud thumping)

1:07:29.256 --> 1:07:32.583
(screaming in fear)

1:07:32.583 --> 1:07:35.893
- No please, I didn't do anything wrong!

1:07:35.893 --> 1:07:39.257
Look, look I'll do anything,
just let me prove it to you.

1:07:42.313 --> 1:07:45.940
Yeah there you go look,
I can do things for you.

1:07:45.940 --> 1:07:49.320
I'm really good, I can
make you feel so good.

1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:52.165
I know you didn't mean to be like that.

1:07:52.165 --> 1:07:54.213
We all lose our heads sometimes.

1:07:54.213 --> 1:07:57.046
(dramatic music)

1:08:05.983 --> 1:08:07.113
- Spill it.

1:08:08.380 --> 1:08:10.550
- Well a neighbor called reporting that

1:08:10.550 --> 1:08:12.470
they had a dead flesh smell coming from

1:08:12.470 --> 1:08:15.563
this apartment at O 800 hours today.

1:08:17.070 --> 1:08:19.973
And this one on the floor is
the neighbor from next door.

1:08:22.890 --> 1:08:24.743
- Let me guess, T-shirt killer.

1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:27.940
- Well this fat fuck
on the couch right here

1:08:27.940 --> 1:08:31.570
was a owner of a T-shirt
wholesale company.

1:08:31.570 --> 1:08:35.630
And this lump of shit on the
floor was a graphic designer

1:08:35.630 --> 1:08:38.810
that do T-shirts for the New
Orleans African connection.

1:08:46.910 --> 1:08:48.490
- Those fucking pecker woods.

1:08:48.490 --> 1:08:50.420
- Who, the clowns from the print shop?

1:08:50.420 --> 1:08:52.240
- I got enough on these two
to stick the book so far up

1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:55.670
they us they be reading
their rights from a flagpole.

1:08:55.670 --> 1:08:58.667
- Oh fuck this shit, these
motherfuckers are putrified

1:08:58.667 --> 1:09:01.150
and it smells like burnt bug wood in here.

1:09:31.129 --> 1:09:34.643
- Hamburgers, I wonder if
Art found out anything.

1:09:38.199 --> 1:09:40.910
(phone ringing)

1:09:40.910 --> 1:09:41.800
- Tee.
- Dude.

1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:42.930
Tell me you found something.

1:09:42.930 --> 1:09:44.510
I'm over at Polly's
right now and the place

1:09:44.510 --> 1:09:46.630
is quieter than a fucking corpse man.

1:09:46.630 --> 1:09:48.437
- [Art] Dude I'm heading to the shop,

1:09:48.437 --> 1:09:50.232
can't make it to Lace's.
- Wait a minute, what why?

1:09:50.232 --> 1:09:51.360
- [Art] Cammi called me and she said she's

1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:53.913
heading over there, she
panicked, some shit.

1:09:54.840 --> 1:09:56.330
I mean she was acting
really fucking weird.

1:09:56.330 --> 1:09:58.290
- Yeah go there.

1:09:58.290 --> 1:10:00.820
They're still working man
the shop should be open.

1:10:00.820 --> 1:10:02.367
I'll swing by Lace's.

1:10:02.367 --> 1:10:04.950
(upbeat music)

1:10:34.610 --> 1:10:39.610
♪ Let me see how hard to shove you ♪

1:10:42.221 --> 1:10:44.721
♪ Let's go on ♪

1:10:45.913 --> 1:10:47.398
- Doesn't he?

1:10:47.398 --> 1:10:48.550
- Yes, yes.

1:10:48.550 --> 1:10:49.383
- Yes what?

1:10:49.383 --> 1:10:50.373
- Yes mistress.

1:10:52.185 --> 1:10:54.150
- That's better, if you
keep that up I might let you

1:10:54.150 --> 1:10:57.220
marinate me with with
your stinking disease,

1:10:57.220 --> 1:10:59.695
soak me with your seasonings and I'll

1:10:59.695 --> 1:11:03.195
melt in your mouth little boy.

1:11:03.195 --> 1:11:06.112
(record scratches)

1:11:08.340 --> 1:11:09.783
Well go check it out hero.

1:11:11.780 --> 1:11:13.193
Go check it out.

1:11:16.016 --> 1:11:19.099
(suspenseful music)

1:11:29.328 --> 1:11:31.151
(quick thumping)

1:11:31.151 --> 1:11:33.901
(dramatic music)

1:11:37.206 --> 1:11:40.206
(screaming in pain)

1:11:47.654 --> 1:11:50.683
(indistinct whispering)

1:11:50.683 --> 1:11:53.163
Come on you little cock sucker.

1:11:53.163 --> 1:11:54.706
(indistinct whispering)

1:11:54.706 --> 1:11:56.544
Come on what you got?

1:11:56.544 --> 1:11:59.294
(dramatic music)

1:12:04.366 --> 1:12:07.699
(indistinct whispering)

1:12:14.814 --> 1:12:15.647
- Got it.

1:12:15.647 --> 1:12:16.480
Detective Watson we gotta move.

1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:17.871
Oh fuck, we gotta move man.

1:12:17.871 --> 1:12:19.280
- Warrant guaranteed
on those two assholes?

1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:20.820
- No I just got two Crime Stoppers

1:12:20.820 --> 1:12:22.090
tips about separate incidents.

1:12:22.090 --> 1:12:24.919
There was screaming
heard own at 213 Sanan.

1:12:24.919 --> 1:12:26.010
- Who lives at that address?

1:12:26.010 --> 1:12:28.140
- That'd be Polyester Coates sir.

1:12:28.140 --> 1:12:30.320
- Poly Coates.
- This place is a shit hole.

1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:31.420
- What about the other one?

1:12:31.420 --> 1:12:35.240
- Screams heard on the 2200
block of Acacia Avenue.

1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:36.990
The neighbors say they hear
funny noises coming out

1:12:36.990 --> 1:12:40.000
of her house all the time
but this was different.

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:41.040
That's Lace Garter.

1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:42.340
- Below Sea Level.

1:12:42.340 --> 1:12:43.720
He's closing in and we're standing

1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:46.200
around here with our dicks in our hands?

1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:48.513
How's that warrant looking?
- It's in the works boss.

1:12:48.513 --> 1:12:49.870
We got the green light
on linking these murders.

1:12:49.870 --> 1:12:52.460
Lab came back and said the
blood from the first note

1:12:52.460 --> 1:12:55.000
was actually the first victim's
blood, Juliette Shields.

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.600
The second, they linked to Hanes.

1:12:57.600 --> 1:12:58.470
Won't be long now.

1:12:58.470 --> 1:13:00.080
- I'm on my way there myself.

1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:01.680
Meet me at the Garter residence.

1:13:02.568 --> 1:13:05.651
(suspenseful music)

1:13:07.250 --> 1:13:11.510
- You know I really do hope
that you and Tee make up.

1:13:11.510 --> 1:13:13.313
You seem like a good couple.

1:13:16.420 --> 1:13:17.773
- Yeah maybe.

1:13:18.918 --> 1:13:22.001
(suspenseful music)

1:13:24.770 --> 1:13:26.943
- Girls like you aren't easy to come by.

1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:30.740
I really like you Heather.

1:13:31.810 --> 1:13:34.893
(suspenseful music)

1:13:45.970 --> 1:13:47.170
Lock up for me will you?

1:13:48.412 --> 1:13:49.912
Have a good night.

1:13:51.324 --> 1:13:52.324
- Thank you.

1:13:56.660 --> 1:13:59.283
- [Art] Tee talk to me.
- Looks like got defaced bro.

1:14:00.190 --> 1:14:02.870
Her house looks like a Tasty
Donut on free king cake day.

1:14:02.870 --> 1:14:04.860
- [Art] What about Mark
and Reggie, anything?

1:14:04.860 --> 1:14:07.930
- No sign bro cocky, look just head back

1:14:07.930 --> 1:14:10.130
to the shop and look
out for the girls okay.

1:14:11.237 --> 1:14:13.510
- [Art] Tee, I just thought of something.

1:14:13.510 --> 1:14:16.555
Do you think it's possible
a girl could be the killer?

1:14:16.555 --> 1:14:18.935
Like someone that we
hadn't thought of yet?

1:14:18.935 --> 1:14:20.907
- I'll meet you at the shop.

1:14:20.907 --> 1:14:23.907
(suspenseful music)

1:15:24.825 --> 1:15:27.658
(dramatic music)

1:17:13.010 --> 1:17:15.810
- The killer entered
through this back door.

1:17:15.810 --> 1:17:17.890
So keep your eyes on the ground.

1:17:17.890 --> 1:17:20.440
- So it's like they just lined them up

1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:22.870
to be pork chops the whole time.

1:17:22.870 --> 1:17:24.810
- Almost makes it feel sorry for them.

1:17:26.230 --> 1:17:28.013
I wanted to string them up myself.

1:17:30.357 --> 1:17:32.747
But no one deserves what happened here.

1:17:33.591 --> 1:17:35.150
- The boys down at the Coates
residence said your buddy

1:17:35.150 --> 1:17:37.980
Mark took an axe to the
skull, and Miss Coates.

1:17:37.980 --> 1:17:41.393
- Yeah I know, decapitated
like a tee ball.

1:17:44.250 --> 1:17:47.973
- The note this time read
this little piggy has none.

1:17:49.510 --> 1:17:51.093
That's a lot of bloodshed boss.

1:17:52.940 --> 1:17:54.483
Bad luck is what it is.

1:17:56.670 --> 1:17:59.467
- Well look like we're back to square one.

1:18:07.413 --> 1:18:09.756
Looks like our look just changed.

1:18:09.756 --> 1:18:12.839
(suspenseful music)

1:18:23.903 --> 1:18:27.153
(metal doors scraping)

1:18:31.932 --> 1:18:32.765
- Oh wait.

1:18:32.765 --> 1:18:35.050
- Geez you trying to
give me a heart attack?

1:18:35.050 --> 1:18:37.180
- I ran all the way from Lace's.

1:18:37.180 --> 1:18:40.619
Almost made your head a
wiffle ball, or a tee ball.

1:18:40.619 --> 1:18:43.133
- Look I think Polly's dead too.

1:18:44.050 --> 1:18:46.450
I heard something over Watson's bug

1:18:46.450 --> 1:18:47.800
right before my phone died.

1:18:49.580 --> 1:18:51.910
What's going on here, is Heather okay?

1:18:51.910 --> 1:18:53.270
- I just pulled up, I'm not sure.

1:18:53.270 --> 1:18:55.660
But I didn't want to go in empty handed.

1:18:55.660 --> 1:18:58.370
- Well give me something
too, what do you got right?

1:18:58.370 --> 1:19:01.690
- Tee man, I just want to
say before we go in there

1:19:01.690 --> 1:19:05.070
last few days have been a
real roller coaster ride.

1:19:05.070 --> 1:19:09.820
But I appreciate you reaching
out to me, it means a lot.

1:19:09.820 --> 1:19:12.380
- Really, I kind of got you
wrapped up in all this though.

1:19:12.380 --> 1:19:15.823
- Yeah but I'm here to
help you finish this.

1:19:18.150 --> 1:19:19.830
Heather needs you.

1:19:19.830 --> 1:19:20.663
- Yeah.

1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:23.553
Shit yeah man.

1:19:26.528 --> 1:19:28.672
(loud thumping)

1:19:28.672 --> 1:19:31.755
(suspenseful music)

1:19:45.130 --> 1:19:47.963
(liquid spraying)

1:19:53.670 --> 1:19:56.343
Dude what are you doing
get me out of this?

1:19:57.690 --> 1:19:59.083
- Finishing the game Tee.

1:20:00.195 --> 1:20:02.645
You played the perfect
pawn but pawns don't last.

1:20:03.764 --> 1:20:05.333
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1:20:06.290 --> 1:20:10.060
No, no it can't be you, I had you bugged.

1:20:10.060 --> 1:20:11.470
- I should be thanking you for all

1:20:11.470 --> 1:20:13.770
the information you provided me with.

1:20:13.770 --> 1:20:16.670
Who knew that your spying
could prove to be more useful

1:20:16.670 --> 1:20:18.633
than just your selfish curiosities?

1:20:19.531 --> 1:20:21.063
- You used me?

1:20:22.200 --> 1:20:24.340
There's no way you planned this.

1:20:24.340 --> 1:20:26.053
- My plan is of a grander scheme.

1:20:26.910 --> 1:20:29.520
So when you called me about working here

1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:32.470
everything just sort of came into place.

1:20:32.470 --> 1:20:34.560
You see I knew if I
knocked off Juliette I'd be

1:20:34.560 --> 1:20:36.373
her perfect replacement at the shop.

1:20:37.720 --> 1:20:40.210
- But how would you know
that I would call you?

1:20:40.210 --> 1:20:43.032
I knew eventually my name would come up,

1:20:43.032 --> 1:20:46.032
been laying the foundation for
quite some time little piggy.

1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:49.670
So with Tank caught up in jail and

1:20:49.670 --> 1:20:52.120
the rest being morgue
meat all that's left now

1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:54.920
is the key witness and
his would be dream girl.

1:20:54.920 --> 1:20:56.150
- Man fuck you.

1:20:56.150 --> 1:20:58.083
And what did you do with Cammi?

1:20:58.083 --> 1:21:00.723
Did you kill her too, you two faced cheat.

1:21:01.648 --> 1:21:03.253
It was beautiful, so much blood.

1:21:05.565 --> 1:21:08.148
The smell of perfume and tears.

1:21:09.337 --> 1:21:13.207
Cammis death was the most elegant moment.

1:21:13.207 --> 1:21:15.820
And she's still waiting for me back home.

1:21:15.820 --> 1:21:17.920
- Man you have been huffing too much

1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:19.320
screen opener you know that?

1:21:20.740 --> 1:21:25.383
Wait elegant, you are Elegant Decay?

1:21:26.500 --> 1:21:28.800
- You guessed it, and
soon everyone will know.

1:21:29.860 --> 1:21:31.450
I'll do anything to succeed.

1:21:31.450 --> 1:21:32.810
- Where'd you get that?

1:21:32.810 --> 1:21:35.180
- Turns out Hanes was into survival,

1:21:35.180 --> 1:21:37.473
as am I, survival of the fittest.

1:21:38.860 --> 1:21:41.343
Cutthroat business calls
for cutthroat plans.

1:21:42.300 --> 1:21:46.153
My plan is flawless,
the cops have no idea.

1:21:48.460 --> 1:21:51.480
- There are voices inside, you
want me to call for backup?

1:21:51.480 --> 1:21:53.600
- No these chumps are ours.

1:21:53.600 --> 1:21:55.643
Shoot when you see the
whites of their skin.

1:21:57.070 --> 1:21:59.210
- And you think you won't get caught.

1:21:59.210 --> 1:22:00.340
You are insane.

1:22:00.340 --> 1:22:01.343
- Not that insane.

1:22:02.260 --> 1:22:05.810
I covered my tracks at Lace's
but I didn't cover yours.

1:22:05.810 --> 1:22:07.663
This whole thing revolves around you.

1:22:08.860 --> 1:22:11.330
Didn't you think of your little bugs?

1:22:11.330 --> 1:22:13.610
They all have your fingerprints.

1:22:13.610 --> 1:22:14.443
(gun fires)

1:22:14.443 --> 1:22:15.276
- Drop the gun!

1:22:15.276 --> 1:22:20.276
(guns firing)
(groaning in pain)

1:22:20.511 --> 1:22:21.344
- Oh fuck.

1:22:21.344 --> 1:22:24.094
Watch out for that crazy cracker.

1:22:28.255 --> 1:22:33.255
(dramatic music)
(screaming in pain)

1:22:55.484 --> 1:22:57.951
- I'm glad you pigs showed up.

1:22:57.951 --> 1:23:00.143
It'll really help me tie
up some loose ends here.

1:23:01.270 --> 1:23:02.793
Speaking of piggies.

1:23:04.286 --> 1:23:07.036
(dramatic music)

1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:11.620
- Heather, Heather.

1:23:11.620 --> 1:23:12.453
Are you okay?

1:23:14.900 --> 1:23:17.200
- Look who decided to join the party.

1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:18.973
- He killed them all, he's insane.

1:23:20.220 --> 1:23:21.513
- Get me out of here.

1:23:22.410 --> 1:23:23.960
- Insane would be if I didn't take

1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:26.780
this time to torture you two lovebirds.

1:23:26.780 --> 1:23:28.950
After all, you're the last two.

1:23:28.950 --> 1:23:31.490
- Art man, she has nothing
to do with this man.

1:23:31.490 --> 1:23:33.950
She doesn't ever wear T-shirts.

1:23:33.950 --> 1:23:37.418
- Are you afraid to see the
love of your life deformed?

1:23:37.418 --> 1:23:38.694
(screaming in pain)

1:23:38.694 --> 1:23:43.500
- No, no man no, let me take this one.

1:23:43.500 --> 1:23:44.840
Let me take this one.

1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:45.743
- How romantic.

1:23:49.410 --> 1:23:50.243
- No no!

1:23:51.725 --> 1:23:52.558
No.

1:23:54.337 --> 1:23:56.130
(coughing)

1:23:56.130 --> 1:23:57.390
- You dirty fuck.

1:23:57.390 --> 1:23:59.620
- Well shit man, I been
running all over town.

1:23:59.620 --> 1:24:02.373
- Nevertheless, I appreciate the gesture.

1:24:06.180 --> 1:24:09.480
Too bad, you two would
have made a great couple,

1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:10.880
if you weren't about to die.

1:24:12.302 --> 1:24:13.135
- Please.

1:24:14.070 --> 1:24:15.236
- Not to worry dear.

1:24:15.236 --> 1:24:16.561
- I'm so sorry.

1:24:16.561 --> 1:24:18.311
- It'll be over soon.

1:24:20.754 --> 1:24:21.587
(screaming in pain)

1:24:21.587 --> 1:24:24.770
This little piggy went to
market, and this little piggy--

1:24:24.770 --> 1:24:26.603
- Fuck you Bro Chacho.

1:24:29.204 --> 1:24:32.537
You're gonna pay for that fuck, gallant.

1:24:34.108 --> 1:24:37.123
This little piggy's about
to buy the farm, right,

1:24:38.095 --> 1:24:40.662
now!
(gun fires)

1:24:40.662 --> 1:24:43.412
(dramatic music)

1:24:52.030 --> 1:24:53.493
(screaming in pain)

1:24:53.493 --> 1:24:55.390
- He cut of my fucking toe.

1:24:55.390 --> 1:24:57.150
You gotta find my fucking
toe, he cut it off.

1:24:57.150 --> 1:24:59.470
- Sit tight guys,
everything's gonna be okay.

1:24:59.470 --> 1:25:02.600
- I'll never walk on the beach again.

1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:03.433
- Thanks Henly.

1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:06.850
How did you know?

1:25:06.850 --> 1:25:08.480
- Don't thank me, thank Poncho,

1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:09.830
he figured the whole thing out.

1:25:09.830 --> 1:25:11.430
- So you just used me as bait?

1:25:11.430 --> 1:25:12.483
- Sorry about that.

1:25:27.630 --> 1:25:29.393
- So Ponch knew the whole time?

1:25:34.230 --> 1:25:36.831
Man I bet you figured this all out

1:25:36.831 --> 1:25:40.310
just listening to everybody
in the shop every day.

1:25:40.310 --> 1:25:43.210
In between my good detective work and Mark

1:25:43.210 --> 1:25:44.740
and Reggie's interactions with Watson

1:25:44.740 --> 1:25:47.330
and Tank you figured out it was Art.

1:25:47.330 --> 1:25:48.960
You knew that him showing up here at the

1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:52.250
same time of the murders
was no coincidence.

1:25:52.250 --> 1:25:53.253
You're a smart dude.

1:25:55.440 --> 1:25:58.357
- Well maybe you do know something.

1:25:59.409 --> 1:26:02.240
(whistles)

1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:03.690
- Well it's over now Heather.

1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:07.640
- You really stood up for me back there.

1:26:08.548 --> 1:26:10.533
I don't know how I'm ever gonna repay you.

1:26:12.418 --> 1:26:14.400
(groaning in pain)

1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:16.750
- They're sending an ambulance
and the cops are coming.

1:26:16.750 --> 1:26:19.910
- Thanks Henly man, you know
you're not so bad after all.

1:26:19.910 --> 1:26:22.982
- Your friend Art really did
eliminate the competition.

1:26:22.982 --> 1:26:23.990
It should be a breeze for me to take over

1:26:23.990 --> 1:26:26.463
the market now, it's my time to shine.

1:26:27.346 --> 1:26:29.740
- The market is clearly yours bro.

1:26:29.740 --> 1:26:32.430
I think I'm gonna relocate
start fresh, I hear

1:26:32.430 --> 1:26:35.180
gyno graffiti is really big
this time of year out West.

1:26:37.310 --> 1:26:39.262
You want to join me?

1:26:39.262 --> 1:26:40.429
- Sounds good.

1:26:50.805 --> 1:26:51.750
- This is

1:26:53.910 --> 1:26:54.743
some bullshit.

1:27:01.624 --> 1:27:04.791
(vehicle approaching)

1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:13.153
- So excited.

1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:15.663
Justice has been served,

1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:18.650
get to start a new life wherever we want,

1:27:19.940 --> 1:27:22.440
finally get to make love
to the girl of my dreams.

1:27:30.957 --> 1:27:33.290
You are so amazing.

1:27:33.290 --> 1:27:34.543
Who's your hero baby?

1:27:35.710 --> 1:27:37.353
Who would have thought it was Art?

1:27:41.770 --> 1:27:42.603
- What's wrong?

1:27:43.720 --> 1:27:44.670
Why are you crying?

1:27:45.948 --> 1:27:48.698
(Heather crying)

1:27:50.923 --> 1:27:52.644
- You ruined everything!

1:27:52.644 --> 1:27:54.460
- What are you talking about?

1:27:54.460 --> 1:27:56.500
- He is supposed to be here not you.

1:27:56.500 --> 1:27:57.333
- Who?

1:28:00.100 --> 1:28:00.933
Art?

1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:05.110
- We had everything falling into place.

1:28:06.489 --> 1:28:07.720
We had Elegant Decay doing so well,

1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:10.270
and everybody else was out of the way.

1:28:10.270 --> 1:28:11.730
- That's bullshit.

1:28:11.730 --> 1:28:13.860
He was gonna deform you
if I hadn't stepped in.

1:28:13.860 --> 1:28:15.110
- We were just playing the parts

1:28:15.110 --> 1:28:16.960
until you were dead you fuck.

1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:18.629
Everything would have been perfect.

1:28:18.629 --> 1:28:21.629
(screaming in pain)

1:28:23.043 --> 1:28:26.063
It was perfect, I played the perfect part.

1:28:27.530 --> 1:28:29.552
I played the victim until the very end.

1:28:29.552 --> 1:28:31.052
- We can start over, together.

1:28:32.245 --> 1:28:33.078
- Oh Tee.

1:28:35.957 --> 1:28:40.624
You would rely consider being
with me after all of this?

1:28:42.210 --> 1:28:43.950
(grunting)

1:28:43.950 --> 1:28:46.700
(dramatic music)

1:28:54.127 --> 1:28:59.127
(both screaming)
(dramatic music)

1:29:19.341 --> 1:29:22.174
(dramatic music)

1:29:45.008 --> 1:29:45.925
Nice shirt.

1:29:46.995 --> 1:29:49.745
(dramatic music)

1:30:53.066 --> 1:30:55.733
(upbeat music)
