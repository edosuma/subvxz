breakfast for real?

04:30.517 --> 04:32.344

or late birthday present?

04:34.241 --> 04:35.551
- Both, actually.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.379
Nilsa is a lady of her word

16:28.379 --> 16:31.241

16:31.310 --> 16:33.896

16:33.965 --> 16:35.379
- What the
are we eating?

16:35.448 --> 16:37.655
- No, no, no, not that.
Not that, not that, not that.

16:37.724 --> 16:39.068
- That's where his head goes.

16:41.482 --> 16:43.103
He was trying to--
"He poison us!"

16:43.172 --> 16:45.448
- No, but me and Codi have been
doing a lot of thinking

16:45.517 --> 16:49.000
and since
we're all getting along--

16:49.068 --> 16:53.000
- So we have planned a nice
camping trip for everyone.

16:53.068 --> 16:54.482
- Sick!
- Well, it's--

16:54.551 --> 16:55.551
- I love going in the woods.

16:55.620 --> 16:56.689
- Well, it's not
really camping.

16:56.758 --> 16:59.448
It's a wellness retreat.

16:59.517 --> 17:01.448
<i>- Why are we going
on a wellness retreat?</i>

17:04.034 --> 17:05.896
I mean, I'm--
I think I'm well.

17:05.965 --> 17:08.068
- A wellness retreat?
- Yeah, so it's like--

17:08.137 --> 17:09.931
- That sounds sober.
- Fresh air.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.931
- Yeah, like I was about to
say--can we still drink?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.344
- Love.
- Of course.

17:13.413 --> 17:15.379
<i>- Camping? Sure. Yeah.
Great.</i>

17:15.448 --> 17:16.758
That is totally
on the list

17:16.827 --> 17:17.827
of things to do
when you're pregnant.

17:17.896 --> 17:18.931
- When are we doing this?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.137
- Where am I gonna take
a shower?

17:20.206 --> 17:21.724
- In the morning.

17:21.793 --> 17:23.206
- Yeah.
- Really?

17:23.275 --> 17:25.068
- Double.
- I don't know why

17:25.137 --> 17:27.482
somebody would want to be
stranded in the woods

17:27.551 --> 17:31.413
with trees and no bathroom
for fun.

17:31.482 --> 17:32.655
That doesn't make any sense
to me.

17:32.724 --> 17:35.448
What are you gonna do--
You're pregnant.

17:35.517 --> 17:36.620
- Mm-mm.
- You're roughin' it

17:36.689 --> 17:37.827
like the rest of us.

17:37.896 --> 17:39.068
- I guess I'll have
to figure it out.

17:39.137 --> 17:41.689
They used to do this
in the 1900s and

17:41.758 --> 17:44.758
If I go into early labor,
I'm gonna look around and say,

17:44.827 --> 17:48.655
<i>who is the most qualified
to birth my child?</i>

17:48.724 --> 17:50.931
And then I'm gonna end up
having my dog birth my child.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.862
- Hell yeah, dude. This
sounds fun as hell.

17:52.931 --> 17:57.482
- And we are
your camp advisers.

17:57.551 --> 17:59.137
- Oh, hell no.
- God no.

17:59.206 --> 18:00.137
- Oh, no.
- How are you gonna

18:00.206 --> 18:02.310
survive outside?
- No way.

18:02.379 --> 18:05.103
- Actually, we survived outside
for five hours.

18:05.172 --> 18:07.482
- We pretty much just
conquered nature out here.

18:07.551 --> 18:09.517
- We know what to eat.

18:09.586 --> 18:11.965
We are hunters and gatherers.

18:13.241 --> 18:15.000
We are prepared.
We know how to survive.

18:15.068 --> 18:16.620
- Yeah, we know how to do this.

18:16.689 --> 18:18.965
<i>- Aimee and Codi

18:23.275 --> 18:24.517

18:25.517 --> 18:30.241
- As your camp counselor,
I'll be there for you.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.724
- That's gonna be
a lot of fun then.

18:31.793 --> 18:32.862
- this

18:32.931 --> 18:34.482
- But we're going
to be up early.

18:34.551 --> 18:35.620
- How early?
- So everybody get

18:35.689 --> 18:37.172
a good night's rest.
- Mm-hmm.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.689
- Well, since I gotta get
a good night's rest,

18:39.758 --> 18:42.379
I'ma go ahead and head to bed.
Thank you for dinner.

18:42.448 --> 18:44.000
- And I got the best
ghost story ever.

18:44.068 --> 18:45.965
- And I will--oh, thank you.

18:46.034 --> 18:47.275
- Of course.
- Oh, Jeremiah, okay.

18:47.344 --> 18:49.413
- You go straight to bed,
go straight to bed.

18:49.482 --> 18:52.034
Give me that napkin, yes.

18:52.103 --> 18:53.241
- Just wake me up
in the morning

18:53.310 --> 18:54.931
when y'all are ready to go, okay?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.931
- I can't imagine
a seven-month pregnant woman

18:57.000 --> 18:58.724
actually saying she's excited
to go camping,

18:58.793 --> 19:00.827
<i>so it surprises me
a little bit</i>

19:00.896 --> 19:03.103
but I'm excited
that she's excited

19:03.172 --> 19:05.655
because I want Ravioli to come
with us too, to be honest.

19:05.724 --> 19:07.103
- Well, Nilsa,
we'll see you in the morning.

19:07.172 --> 19:08.758
- See you in the morning.
- Bright and early.

19:08.827 --> 19:10.793
- Pack you
- Pack you tonight.

19:10.862 --> 19:12.517
- I will.
- Okay.

19:13.724 --> 19:15.689
- I'm not going camping.

19:15.758 --> 19:17.206
I am not going camping.

19:17.275 --> 19:19.689
What would I do?
A pregnant girl camping?

19:19.758 --> 19:21.034
Come on, baby.

19:21.103 --> 19:22.620
I don't think, like,
on the list of activities

19:22.689 --> 19:26.758
approved by the FHA or the DHA
or the AHA

19:26.827 --> 19:29.344
or the whatever department
of Homeland pregnancy

19:29.413 --> 19:32.793
women mamas allowed to-do list.

19:32.862 --> 19:34.862
I don't think camping's
on one of them.

19:34.931 --> 19:36.034
There's no way.

19:36.103 --> 19:38.448
So I'm gonna make a plan
to figure out

19:38.517 --> 19:41.172
how to sneak out of here
because I am not going camping.

19:41.241 --> 19:42.586
- How do you think
they took the news?

19:42.655 --> 19:44.241
- Well, Gus is very excited.

19:44.310 --> 19:45.551
<i>- I knew he would be.</i>

19:45.620 --> 19:47.068
- Yeah, Gus is very excited.

19:47.137 --> 19:48.137
I don't know about
everybody else,

19:48.206 --> 19:49.965
how excited they are gonna be.

19:50.034 --> 19:51.068
- We've gotta get the
out of here.

19:51.137 --> 19:52.482
- Candace is not excited.

19:52.551 --> 19:54.206
- Yeah, Candace is
not excited at all.

19:54.275 --> 19:55.862
- All right, let me go put this
into some Tupperware

19:55.931 --> 19:57.517
so I can put this in my purse

19:57.586 --> 19:59.689
'cause y'all not gonna have me
starving out there.

19:59.758 --> 20:01.965
- Okay, so what's
the camp rules?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.586
- Camp rules is they always
listen to us

20:03.655 --> 20:04.793
and do what the
we tell them to do.

20:04.862 --> 20:06.068
- Yeah, that's--
- That's number one.

20:06.137 --> 20:07.965
- That's number one
on the list.

20:08.034 --> 20:09.448
- Number one.

20:09.517 --> 20:11.241
- Where are you? Because I'm
about to come meet you.

20:11.310 --> 20:14.896
I am busting out of here
because I am not going camping.

20:14.965 --> 20:17.793
<i>- Hell, yeah. Baby,
I'm gonna go with Augusta.</i>

20:17.862 --> 20:20.068
- Shh. This is a secret.

20:20.137 --> 20:22.000
They don't know I'm leaving.

20:24.758 --> 20:26.724
- Good morning, campers.
-

20:26.793 --> 20:28.137
It's time to get ready.

20:28.206 --> 20:30.206

20:30.275 --> 20:32.896

20:32.965 --> 20:34.620

21:58.931 --> 22:00.620

22:00.689 --> 22:02.379
you're gonna ruin the plan.

34:42.137 --> 34:45.068
- Oh, yeah, he's sprinting.

34:45.137 --> 34:47.689
- The powers of the back thong,
they are making him run faster.

34:47.758 --> 34:49.482
- Is he going--
Is he going pee--oh, damn.

34:49.551 --> 34:52.000
- It's the runaway thong, man.

34:52.068 --> 34:53.586
- Let's get peachy.

34:53.655 --> 34:54.862
- All right,

34:54.931 --> 34:56.896
Camp Peach on three.
- One, two, three.

34:56.965 --> 34:58.413
Camp Peach!

34:58.482 --> 34:59.896
- All right,
let's get up.

35:06.241 --> 35:08.586
- Candace!

35:08.655 --> 35:10.137
Whoo!

35:10.206 --> 35:11.689
- Line up on this side.
- Line up.

35:11.758 --> 35:13.827
- All right, go ahead, Gus

35:13.896 --> 35:14.827
Yee-haw.

35:14.896 --> 35:16.793
- Go gray, go gray!

35:16.862 --> 35:19.724
Ohh!

35:19.793 --> 35:21.275
- Hey!

35:21.344 --> 35:23.034
Here, I'ma jump off.

35:23.103 --> 35:24.241
- Oh, gosh.
- Oh, [bleep],

35:24.310 --> 35:25.724
- What the--okay.
- Okay.

35:28.241 --> 35:30.103
<i>- Me and Aimee
are camp counselors.</i>

35:30.172 --> 35:32.551
<i>Now, the first thing
we need to do is set the tone.</i>

35:32.620 --> 35:34.241
You're gonna do what we say,

35:34.310 --> 35:37.034
and you are gonna participate
in all the activities.

35:38.689 --> 35:40.793
- Uh- uh, no, God damn.

35:40.862 --> 35:43.103
- We've set this game up here.
Now, it's all about

35:43.172 --> 35:44.689
communication and working together.

35:44.758 --> 35:45.862
- And trust.
- And trust

35:45.931 --> 35:47.724
- And listening.
- And listening.

35:47.793 --> 35:50.206
We got this game called
minefield, and I'm excited.

35:50.275 --> 35:52.551
One of you
is gonna be blindfolded.

35:52.620 --> 35:54.275
The other one is gonna
spin them around.

35:54.344 --> 35:57.103
And then you're going to try
to get them to the finish line,

35:57.172 --> 35:58.586
which is the grass over here.

35:58.655 --> 36:00.724
And you yell at 'em so, they
don't hit this

36:00.793 --> 36:02.586
- All right.
- Got it, boo.

36:02.655 --> 36:04.344
<i>- This is a wellness retreat.</i>

36:04.413 --> 36:06.068
And when I say
wellness retreat,

36:06.137 --> 36:08.448
I mean like the well
at the bar,

36:08.517 --> 36:10.034
you know,
it's bottom shelf

36:10.103 --> 36:11.413
I mean, that's
what you gonna get.

36:11.482 --> 36:13.931
- Here, I'll pick.
Candace's partner is.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.206
- My nails is kinda long.
Can you open this?

36:16.275 --> 36:18.206
- Me.

36:18.275 --> 36:20.068
- Kirky Kirk!
- God!

36:20.137 --> 36:22.310
- Yes!
- Game time.

36:22.379 --> 36:24.448
- That leaves y'all two.

36:24.517 --> 36:26.034
- I'm not liking these odds
right now.

36:26.103 --> 36:27.379
- Did we say what
the losing teams

36:27.448 --> 36:28.827
have to get
at the end of the day?

36:28.896 --> 36:30.310
Like, there's gotta be
a punishment or something.

36:30.379 --> 36:32.000
- No there's not.
Because we're positive now.

36:32.068 --> 36:33.931
- This is a positive
wellness camp.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
- Raw eggs it is.
- Okay, I'll do that.

36:36.068 --> 36:38.724
- This camp is all
about communicating

36:38.793 --> 36:41.034
and understanding each other.

36:42.068 --> 36:43.965
- Wait, are y'all spinning
right now?

36:44.034 --> 36:46.275
- Oh, what the [bleep]?
Gus, come on. We're late.

36:48.482 --> 36:50.034
- All right go, go, go.
- Go, Candace!

36:50.103 --> 36:52.137
- Straight, straight, straight,
faster, straight, you good.

36:52.206 --> 36:53.689
This is all you.
Left, left, left.

36:53.758 --> 36:55.310
Three steps left.
Three steps left.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.448
- Left.
- Now, turn your body.

36:56.517 --> 36:57.620
Turn your body left.
Right there.

36:57.689 --> 36:58.793
- No!
- Sure, straight, straight.

36:58.862 --> 36:59.586
Turn your body right.
- Hey, babe,

36:59.655 --> 37:01.172
it's on the other way,

37:01.241 --> 37:03.448
I hate to talk about myself
and Candice like this,

37:03.517 --> 37:05.068
but I'm sorry,
me and Candace

37:05.137 --> 37:08.241
<i>are both naturals
at pretty much nothing.</i>

37:08.310 --> 37:10.000
I think we're on
the wrong side of the road.

37:10.068 --> 37:12.000
- God damn it, Aimee,
you gonna kill us.

37:12.068 --> 37:13.689
- Stop!
-

37:13.758 --> 37:15.758
- I barely made it here alive

37:15.827 --> 37:17.586
and I'm the one
giving directions.

37:17.655 --> 37:19.965
- Wait, no, Aimee tell me
where to go.

37:20.034 --> 37:23.586
- Candace, turn right.
Candace, turn right.

37:23.655 --> 37:25.344
Candace, you're being
a thirsty bitch,

37:25.413 --> 37:26.758
and you're not listening to me.

37:26.827 --> 37:28.655
- Okay, right.

37:28.724 --> 37:30.206
Now straight away.
Straight away.

37:30.275 --> 37:33.068
Straight away you--go for
the--for the home run, baby.

37:33.137 --> 37:35.172
You going home! You going home!

37:35.241 --> 37:37.896
Oh! [bleep]!

37:39.689 --> 37:41.137
<i>- All good communication,</i>

37:41.206 --> 37:42.379
<i>you know,
you're gonna win the game.</i>

37:42.448 --> 37:43.862
I had a good strategy and Gus

37:43.931 --> 37:45.310
took me to
the Promised Land, baby.

37:45.379 --> 37:48.172
- Babe, you made it.
- Oh, my God!

37:48.241 --> 37:49.689
Oh, my God.

37:49.758 --> 37:53.172
- Jeremiah and Codi lose.

37:53.241 --> 37:54.551
- Why do we lose?

37:54.620 --> 37:57.551
- Aimee cheated.
- No, I did not.

37:57.620 --> 38:01.827
Look, I'm a camp counselor,
so I'm not allowed to cheat.

38:01.896 --> 38:04.586
Don't slander my name
like that.

38:04.655 --> 38:08.482
- Codi, looks like
raw eggs it is.

38:08.551 --> 38:10.689
- Oh, no. Absolutely not.

38:10.758 --> 38:12.551
- You need some protein
in your life.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.137
- I don't wanna drip on you.
- Yeah, don't drip on me.

38:14.206 --> 38:15.448
<i>I'm a man of my word,</i>

38:15.517 --> 38:18.896
but I've seen people drink
raw eggs before.

38:18.965 --> 38:20.758
I got it. I got it. I got it.
- I got it.

38:20.827 --> 38:23.172
- It's nasty.
Swallow it down, right?

38:23.241 --> 38:24.172
- You bust the yolk
in your mouth

38:24.241 --> 38:25.206
and then swallow it, yeah.

38:25.275 --> 38:27.896
- Give me one of those.

38:27.965 --> 38:30.344
- No, what the [bleep]?
You--you--

38:30.413 --> 38:32.517
Bitch, it didn't even
touch your mouth.

38:32.586 --> 38:35.931
- Gross. It's gross.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.137
- There you go. Let it out.

38:38.206 --> 38:40.310
Puke and rally!

38:40.379 --> 38:42.827
- Puking and rallying is not
a part of this retreat.

38:42.896 --> 38:44.551
<i>We should get
a pay rise.</i>

38:46.896 --> 38:49.551
So now we are about
to play Human Knot.

38:49.620 --> 38:51.310
- Human Knot!
- Like Human Centipede

38:51.379 --> 38:52.689
where we each other's
mouth?

38:52.758 --> 38:53.965
- Oh, no.
- I didn't know

38:54.034 --> 38:57.034
that was the game, Kirk,
but thanks for that.

38:57.103 --> 38:58.862
So, we all grab
each other's hands

38:58.931 --> 39:00.034
in different positions
in a circle.

39:00.103 --> 39:01.482
- And twist them around.

39:01.551 --> 39:03.620
- And twist them around
and we have to figure out

39:03.689 --> 39:05.482
how to get out of the knot

39:05.551 --> 39:07.034
- Without breaking
each other hands.

39:07.103 --> 39:09.827
- Without breaking hands.
This works on teamwork.

39:09.896 --> 39:11.724
- Okay.
- Okay, now we unravel.

39:11.793 --> 39:13.896
- Unravel mean? Do we get
in a perfect circle then?

39:13.965 --> 39:16.172
- We have to,
like, get, like, out.

39:16.241 --> 39:17.620
- Oh, ok--okay. Go down.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.103
- No, no.

39:19.172 --> 39:20.103
- Step over your arm.

39:20.172 --> 39:22.103
- Oh [bleep]! Ahh!

39:22.172 --> 39:24.206
- You know, we're dipping
through. We unravelling.

39:24.275 --> 39:25.758
It's like,
why isn't this working?

39:28.586 --> 39:29.758
- Okay.
- Oh, oh, wait no.

39:29.827 --> 39:31.000
- Now we're right back
where we started.

39:31.068 --> 39:32.448
- Good job guys.
- How do we go back?

39:32.517 --> 39:34.172
- This is what happens
when you get a homeschooler

39:34.241 --> 39:36.000
and somebody
that eats play-dough together.

39:36.068 --> 39:37.586
That's what happens.

39:37.655 --> 39:39.655
- Step over me.
Step over me, Gus.

39:39.724 --> 39:42.310
- Okay.
- yeah. Okay, go in.

39:42.379 --> 39:43.551
- Right.
- Let's go!

39:43.620 --> 39:45.482
- Just like that. I told you!
- Whoo!

39:47.241 --> 39:48.793
- We did it!
- Yes!

39:48.862 --> 39:51.482
- You know, the games
are actually kinda working.

39:51.551 --> 39:53.241
We did it. We did it.

39:53.310 --> 39:57.206
But I mean, how many more games
do we have to play?

39:57.275 --> 39:58.862
- It's called egg toss.

39:58.931 --> 40:02.689
So again, draw out of the pot
new team every time.

40:02.758 --> 40:03.724
You don't get
the same partners.

40:03.793 --> 40:06.413
So, Kirk, Gus, go ahead.

40:06.482 --> 40:07.758
- Let's just--

40:07.827 --> 40:10.034
- Well, well,
me and old Jeremiah.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.551
- Yes!

40:12.620 --> 40:13.724
- Go figure.

40:13.793 --> 40:17.103
- Yes, yes, yes!

40:17.172 --> 40:18.758
- Yeah, me and J are about
to smoke this

40:20.517 --> 40:23.379
<i>- For this game, you really
have to trust your partner</i>

40:23.448 --> 40:25.310
<i>and communicate very well.</i>

40:25.379 --> 40:27.827
And that's something that them
two have not been able to do.

40:27.896 --> 40:30.724
<i>So, you know, this could be
a ticking time bomb,</i>

40:30.793 --> 40:32.413
<i>just waiting to blow up
right now.</i>

40:32.482 --> 40:35.413
One egg for you.
One egg for you.

40:35.482 --> 40:36.827
- Now I'm trusting
you not to peg me

40:36.896 --> 40:38.172
with this egg,
you son of a bitch.

40:40.517 --> 40:43.689
Me and Gus are on a team.

40:43.758 --> 40:45.310
You having fun up there, God?

40:47.137 --> 40:49.551
- We ready to roll?

40:55.172 --> 40:58.172
<i>- Made in Georgia.</i>

41:01.827 --> 41:03.413
Yardi Gras!
Yardi Gras!

41:03.482 --> 41:05.344
- I wanna see boobies!
- Oh!

41:05.413 --> 41:08.482
Yardi Gras!
- Ohh!

41:08.551 --> 41:10.931
- I see my boys
Devante and Caleb

41:11.000 --> 41:13.793
walking in the building,
I'm like, yes, sirski!

41:13.862 --> 41:15.068
- Hi, I'm Tori.
- Codi, nice to meet you.

41:15.137 --> 41:16.172
- Nice to meet you.
- Codi, nice to meet you.

41:16.241 --> 41:17.689
- Oh, I have mango, too.

41:17.758 --> 41:19.586
- Beautiful!
- Aimee, you might wanna move.

41:19.655 --> 41:21.068
- Aimee, move!

41:21.137 --> 41:22.620
- Damn!

41:22.689 --> 41:26.241
- These two Tori's have eyes
for Gus and Gus only.

41:28.793 --> 41:30.827
- I'm a man.
I can only be so strong.
