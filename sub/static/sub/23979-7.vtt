00:01.000 --> 00:02.911
Previously on
"Life Sentence"...

00:02.960 --> 00:04.450
Peter: The Nortons wanted
a fast escrow,

00:04.500 --> 00:06.537
so they offered to let me
stay in the guest house.

00:06.590 --> 00:08.456
My brother would make
the best barista.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.956
Woman:
Welcome aboard.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.297
Put them on the bottom
of the coffee cup

00:12.340 --> 00:13.717
and I'll pay you
in the tip jar.

00:13.760 --> 00:14.966
What the hell?

00:15.010 --> 00:17.217
You're under arrest.

00:17.260 --> 00:18.557
Those pills
that I was selling --

00:18.600 --> 00:21.228
Schedule II drug,
which means...

00:21.270 --> 00:23.056
You're facing
a felony charge.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.556
I'm married
to an incredible man,

00:24.600 --> 00:27.399
and it really sucks to know
that he might never understand

00:27.440 --> 00:30.182
what I'm going through
the way that you do.

00:30.230 --> 00:31.561
Wes: Do you have feelings
for him?

00:31.610 --> 00:33.647
Yes,
I have a connection with him,

00:33.700 --> 00:36.021
but he's just
a friend.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.072
There aren't words to describe
how that makes me feel.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.327
Are we
going to be okay?

00:40.370 --> 00:41.826
I don't know.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.168
Stella: The funny thing
about my family is,

00:47.210 --> 00:50.089
when times are good,
we fall apart,

00:50.130 --> 00:51.757
but throw in a crisis

00:51.800 --> 00:54.508
and we come together
to battle as one.

00:54.550 --> 00:55.540
We're strong.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.090
We're focused.

01:00.810 --> 01:05.019
Show me the stars up
in the sky We're brave.

01:05.060 --> 01:09.054
Make me believe we're alive
And compassionate.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.896
We're like the Justice League,

01:10.940 --> 01:14.149
bonded together in a sacred
mission to fight crime.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.440
Sure, in this case,

01:15.490 --> 01:18.403
the crime was a felony
committed by my brother.

01:18.450 --> 01:22.330
Still, we were there
for him to lean on.

01:22.370 --> 01:24.748
But the real hero of my family
was Dad.

01:24.790 --> 01:25.996
We will see
the northern lights together

01:26.040 --> 01:27.576
Aiden:
Oh, wow.

01:27.630 --> 01:29.746
I just
got off the phone

01:29.790 --> 01:31.997
with Asheville's
top defense attorney.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.916
He's taking the case,
and he thinks we can fight this.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.416
Even though I'm guilty?

01:35.470 --> 01:36.335
Let's not
say that anymore.

01:36.380 --> 01:39.008
I appreciate you
stepping up for me.

01:39.050 --> 01:39.755
Of course.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.179
A night in jail was one thing,
but this is your future.

01:43.220 --> 01:44.597
Okay, hands in.

01:44.640 --> 01:45.937
It's a beautiful day

01:45.980 --> 01:47.766
Come on, hands in.

01:50.650 --> 01:51.856
Come on.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.858
"Innocent until proven guilty"
on three.

01:54.900 --> 01:57.358
One...two...three.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.028
All;
Innocent until proven guilty!

02:00.990 --> 02:02.867
That was weird.
Hey, Peter.

02:02.910 --> 02:03.945
Oh, hi.

02:03.990 --> 02:06.869
Uh, this is
my whole family.

02:06.910 --> 02:07.957
Hi. Hi. Hi.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.707
It's nice
to meet you all.

02:09.750 --> 02:10.568
Woman: It looks like
quite a meal.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.166
You guys celebrating
something fun?

02:12.210 --> 02:14.201
Just my recent
drug arrest.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.877
It's a nice,
narcotic-free family dinner.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.297
Oh, I may have taken
a Valium earlier.

02:18.340 --> 02:21.048
Every time I look
in your eyes, I see it

02:21.100 --> 02:23.137
We should go inside.
Yes, uh, we should.

02:23.180 --> 02:24.807
It was good
to meet you all.

02:24.850 --> 02:27.137
Ooh-ooh

02:27.180 --> 02:30.229
Good one.

02:30.270 --> 02:34.434
Yep, it felt like
everyone in this family

02:34.480 --> 02:35.811
was closer than ever.

02:35.860 --> 02:36.486
Night.

02:36.530 --> 02:39.272
Night.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.019
Almost everyone.

02:45.450 --> 02:47.748
Don't worry about a thing

02:47.790 --> 02:51.328
You'll learn to live again

02:51.380 --> 02:53.337
You're gonna learn
to live again

02:53.380 --> 02:56.918
Oh, oh, oh

03:00.470 --> 03:02.757
Hey.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.427
So,
I've been thinking...

03:04.470 --> 03:05.926
Mnh-mnh, you're not
going to try to convince me

03:05.970 --> 03:08.177
to adopt a hairless cat
again, are you?

03:08.230 --> 03:09.095
NO.
Wait, why?

03:09.140 --> 03:11.552
Have you
changed your mind?

03:11.600 --> 03:12.431
Okay.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.857
Well, actually,
what I was going to say is,

03:13.900 --> 03:17.859
I-I know that things
between us have been,

03:17.900 --> 03:19.857
well, not great.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.200
I just -- I can't figure out
the right word.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.947
The point is...

03:24.990 --> 03:27.448
I want
to fix things.

03:27.490 --> 03:28.787
How do you propose
we do that?

03:28.830 --> 03:31.959
By fast-forwarding
to the end of this fight.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.786
We both know you're eventually
going to forgive me

03:33.830 --> 03:36.549
because that is what we do --
we fight, forgive, repeat.

03:36.590 --> 03:38.456
We're like
relationship shampoo.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.377
Let's lather up
and rinse.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.637
Eh, probably wasn't
my best metaphor.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.889
Babe, I don't know
how I can fast-forward

03:46.930 --> 03:48.887
past the fact
that you told another man

03:48.930 --> 03:49.806
that he knows you
better than I do.

03:49.850 --> 03:52.228
Neither do 1.
I hate knowing that I hurt you.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.725
I love you,

03:55.770 --> 03:59.650
like, a whole big bushel
full of whole-kernel corn,

03:59.690 --> 04:01.738
and that is
a whole lot.

04:01.780 --> 04:03.157
My grandmother
used to say that to me.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.579
She was an odd woman
who loved corn.

04:06.620 --> 04:10.329
Wes,
I'm trying here.

04:10.370 --> 04:12.498
And I appreciate
the effort,

04:12.540 --> 04:15.828
but I don't think
there's anything you can do...

04:15.880 --> 04:19.510
except give it time.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.428
I wished Wes and I
were as united as my family was

04:25.470 --> 04:27.928
behind Aiden,
but we weren't.

04:27.970 --> 04:30.519
We were divided.
And we weren't the only ones.

04:30.560 --> 04:33.018
Okay, and so,
while Fiona is very advanced,

04:33.060 --> 04:35.518
Frank is actually
struggling to keep up.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.188
We'd like to recommend
holding him back next year.

04:38.230 --> 04:39.777
Seriously?

04:39.820 --> 04:42.699
It's kindergarten.
They're making hand roosters.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.526
Is that what those were?

04:44.570 --> 04:48.200
- Frank's look like
a little lumpy dinosaur. It --

04:48.240 --> 04:49.787
I'm sorry.
What you were saying?

04:49.830 --> 04:51.616
At this age,
we look for social markers,

04:51.660 --> 04:54.709
and Frank seems to be
showing all the signs

04:54.750 --> 04:56.536
of being a people-pleaser
and a follower.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.628
So, he's nice
and popular.

04:58.670 --> 05:01.378
Mrs. Rojas -- We're
not holding our son back

05:01.420 --> 05:04.970
because he's easy-going
and bad at tracing.

05:05.010 --> 05:08.253
W-Which is a conclusion
that we will draw at home,

05:08.300 --> 05:10.382
after we think
about it.

05:15.060 --> 05:16.642
You sure
you don't want breakfast?

05:16.690 --> 05:17.896
No, I'm good.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.305
Dad's got me jogging
to clear my head.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.977
It's actually kind of working.
wWwe'll see you when you get back.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.816
Bye.

05:23.860 --> 05:25.237
How do you like
your coffee?

05:25.280 --> 05:28.159
You made my coffee
every day for 30 years.

05:28.200 --> 05:28.655
You know
how I like my coffee.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.737
I thought I knew
how you liked your sex, too,

05:30.780 --> 05:33.249
but apparently I --
Milk and sugar is great.

05:33.290 --> 05:35.907
We're, though --
yeah.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.416
Hey.

05:37.460 --> 05:39.667
How are you doing
with everything?

05:39.710 --> 05:40.415
Good.
Oh.

05:40.460 --> 05:42.497
You know, I haven't been on
my own since before I met you,

05:42.550 --> 05:44.336
and it's kind of nice.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.916
That's a lie.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.927
It's terrifying.

05:47.970 --> 05:51.099
But Lizzie and Diego
are helping me through it,

05:51.140 --> 05:52.710
which is good.

05:55.890 --> 05:58.268
Must be weird living in
the shadow of our former life.

05:58.310 --> 05:59.766
Peter:
It's awful.

05:59.810 --> 06:02.108
I've spent so much time
watching the Nortons,

06:02.150 --> 06:06.599
my elbow wore the paint
off that windowsill.

06:06.650 --> 06:08.607
Oh, buddy,
don't do it.

06:09.910 --> 06:12.117
I'm warning you.

06:12.160 --> 06:16.950
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

06:18.580 --> 06:20.958
I guess I should have
fixed that years ago, huh?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.799
Oh, no.
It's part of the charm.

06:23.840 --> 06:24.045
You miss
our old house?

06:24.090 --> 06:26.661
I miss
our old life.

06:27.510 --> 06:30.923
Well, maybe just
the good parts I remember.

06:32.430 --> 06:34.467
Ah, we're still
a family, Peter.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.305
No matter
what life throws at us,

06:35.350 --> 06:37.978
although I wish
it would stop throwing

06:38.020 --> 06:38.885
quite so much
in our direction.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.398
A lawyer's
going to help,

06:41.440 --> 06:43.147
but he is expensive.

06:43.190 --> 06:44.726
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.181
I'd like to use some of the
money we made selling the house

06:47.240 --> 06:48.059
for his retainer,

06:48.110 --> 06:50.067
but I wanted
to run that by you first.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.659
That is _
a pleasant surprise.

06:52.700 --> 06:55.738
Old Peter would have
just taken the money.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.996
And if this money
helps keep him out of prison,

06:57.040 --> 07:00.169
you have my blessing
to use every penny.

07:05.130 --> 07:05.164
I'm supposed to
work today,

07:05.210 --> 07:08.669
but I don't see my name
on the schedule.

07:08.720 --> 07:08.913
Oh, right.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.837
That's probably because
you don't work here anymore.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.676
What do you mean?

07:13.720 --> 07:16.098
Stella, there's no easy way
to say this.

07:16.140 --> 07:17.517
You're fired.
That seemed pretty easy.

07:17.560 --> 07:21.190
Look, over time, I've come
to not hate you so much,

07:21.230 --> 07:21.435
but after
your brother's arrest,

07:21.480 --> 07:23.687
corporate said
I had to let you go.

07:23.730 --> 07:26.358
Your father owns
this coffee shop.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.526
Anyway...

07:27.570 --> 07:30.278
Oh.
...best of luck.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.117
I'm so sorry
about your job, Stella.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.198
I can't help
but feel responsible.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.708
Mm, that makes sense
because you are responsible.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.036
I'm going to
make it up to you.

07:42.080 --> 07:42.706
I promise. Stella;
Oh, it's okay.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.957
I'm getting
that job back.

07:45.000 --> 07:45.284
How are you
going to do that?

07:45.340 --> 07:47.957
Don't know yet,
but I will figure something out.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.877
Okay, folks.
I come bearing good news.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.969
Now, the DA has made us
a very generous plea deal.

07:54.010 --> 07:57.059
Instead of three years
in prison, if you plead guilty,

07:57.100 --> 07:59.979
you'll receive nine months
in @ minimum-security facility,

08:00.020 --> 08:02.261
which means you'll be out
in five with good behavior.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.478
Okay, then --
No, absolutely not.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.816
What do you mean,
no?

08:10.860 --> 08:12.646
I mean,
I'm not letting my son

08:12.700 --> 08:13.064
go to prison
for five minutes.

08:13.110 --> 08:15.989
Dad, it sounds like
a good deal,

08:16.030 --> 08:16.986
considering
how guilty I am.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.328
Okay, you really need
to stop saying that.

08:19.370 --> 08:21.407
Peter, do you really think
that we should go to trial?

08:21.460 --> 08:24.748
Oh, notice how she asked him
what he thought.

08:24.790 --> 08:27.168
Not our moment.
Got it.

08:27.210 --> 08:28.837
Mr. Berg,
can you win this case?

08:28.880 --> 08:29.164
Well,
it's going to be tough.

08:29.210 --> 08:32.009
The police received an anonymous
tip and made an arrest.

08:32.049 --> 08:35.179
I'm sorry, but there's
no easy defense here.

08:35.220 --> 08:36.085
I didn't ask
if it would be easy, Mr. Berg.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.849
I asked
if you could win.

08:39.890 --> 08:41.927
Well, of course, I...
could win.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.095
Okay.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.015
Then no deal.

08:44.059 --> 08:47.189
If there's any chance Aiden can
avoid a felony conviction,

08:47.230 --> 08:49.938
we have to take it.

08:53.150 --> 08:55.608
You heard the man.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.866
No deal.

08:59.910 --> 09:02.959
Stella:
Wait a second.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.038
If we lose, does he definitely
get three years?

09:06.080 --> 09:07.957
There's no mandatory
sentence here.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.083
The judge determines,
but you never know.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.137
Dad.

09:17.180 --> 09:19.968
Are you sure you want to risk
Aiden getting three years?

09:20.010 --> 09:22.718
I know about lost time,
and I just --

09:22.770 --> 09:25.558
I think that he should
consider taking the plea.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.931
Sorry, but I can't risk
Aiden becoming a felon

09:26.980 --> 09:27.936
because someone
called in a tip.

09:27.980 --> 09:29.857
If Aiden
becomes a felon,

09:29.900 --> 09:31.356
it's because
he committed a felony.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.357
Can everyone please
stop saying that?!

09:33.400 --> 09:35.107
Dad,
what's going on?

09:35.150 --> 09:37.278
Why are you blaming the person
who called in a tip?

09:37.320 --> 09:39.118
I'm not.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.275
Forget about it.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.038
What aren't
you telling me?

09:43.080 --> 09:45.367
Nothing.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.036
Oh, my God.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.208
It was you.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.956
You got Aiden arrested?!

09:57.180 --> 09:59.137
Please tell me that
you did not have Aiden arrested.

09:59.180 --> 10:01.046
I thought
we were losing him.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.636
I was trying
to help.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.057
I didn't know how serious
it would be.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.807
You didn't think
to check?

10:05.850 --> 10:08.478
I thought it was
his first offense.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.976
I thought he'd get
a slap on the wrist.

10:10.020 --> 10:12.899
You have to tell him.

10:12.940 --> 10:13.395
I can't do that.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.989
I can get Aiden through this,
but he has to trust me

10:16.030 --> 10:18.658
and he won't
if he knows the truth.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.408
Please, I'm begging you,
do not tell anyone.

10:21.450 --> 10:23.327
Oh, Dad.

10:25.700 --> 10:28.920
Wow.
That's a new low.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.167
I maintain telling your husband
doesn't count.

10:31.210 --> 10:33.167
Yes, it is,
even for my family.

10:33.210 --> 10:34.336
You could tell Aiden.

10:34.380 --> 10:35.586
No,
that would destroy him.

10:35.630 --> 10:37.257
But it might get him
to take the plea.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.928
But I don't even know
if that's what he should do.

10:39.970 --> 10:42.678
Is pleading guilty to a felony
better than risking a trial?

10:42.720 --> 10:43.676
It's apples and oranges.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.267
Speaking of which,
do you want apples or oranges?

10:45.310 --> 10:47.768
I can't believe
that Aiden could go to prison

10:47.810 --> 10:50.939
and we are
shopping for produce.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.937
Well,
we do have to eat.

10:52.980 --> 10:55.028
Ooh,
thank you.

10:55.070 --> 10:56.856
Oh, it's soap!

10:56.900 --> 10:58.106
Okay, I'm not
going to say anything.

10:58.150 --> 10:59.447
Yeah,
probably smart.

10:59.490 --> 11:01.106
Telling Aiden would just
make things worse.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.197
Yeah.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.618
Stella
Hey!

11:05.660 --> 11:07.037
Dr. Chang, hi.
Wow!

11:07.080 --> 11:10.209
It's so weird to see you guys
outside of the hospital.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.456
Last time I did,
we were at your parents' house

11:11.500 --> 11:12.956
and your entire family
was imploding.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.879
Oh,
that's still happening.

11:15.920 --> 11:20.209
Oh.
Um, sorry to hear that.

11:20.260 --> 11:22.217
Hey, if you guys want to
take your mind off things,

11:22.260 --> 11:24.137
Will's band
is playing tonight.

11:24.180 --> 11:25.215
They're really great.
Of course he's in a band.

11:25.260 --> 11:29.470
Well, thank you so much
for the offer, but we can't.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.056
Yeah, we just --
we have way too much going on.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.807
Next time?
Yeah, for sure.

11:32.850 --> 11:34.056
Good to see you guys. Bye.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.976
Bye.

11:36.020 --> 11:38.990
Thank you for getting us
out of that.

11:39.030 --> 11:39.565
Of course.

11:39.610 --> 11:43.069
No, I know how awkward that
would be for the both of us.

11:44.450 --> 11:46.157
Plus,
I love you.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.076
Remember, like a whole
big bushel full of whole k--

11:47.120 --> 11:49.657
Enough of that.
Yeah, got it.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.156
Yeah.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.668
Um, excuse me.
Didn't I fire you?

11:57.710 --> 12:01.169
You did, but I reject your
firing. You can't do that.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.837
I just did it because I have
been through too much this week

12:03.890 --> 12:05.255
and I am the best
damn barista you've got.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.758
No, you're not.
Marcus is.

12:07.810 --> 12:07.924
You come in a solid fifth,
though.

12:07.970 --> 12:12.009
Look, I'm not giving up
and it may take some time,

12:12.060 --> 12:13.186
but I will show up here
every single day

12:13.230 --> 12:15.267
and keep doing my job
whether you pay me or not.

12:15.310 --> 12:18.018
Now, can I please
have my uniform back?

12:18.070 --> 12:19.185
Absolutely not.

12:19.230 --> 12:19.685
Really?

12:19.730 --> 12:21.528
I thought that was
a good speech.

12:21.570 --> 12:22.947
It felt like
we were getting somewhere.

12:22.990 --> 12:24.355
Oh, wow.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.866
You must
be Stella's sister.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.947
Yeah,
how did you know?

12:27.990 --> 12:29.116
You're both
four feet tall

12:29.160 --> 12:30.946
and have the same
creepy doll eyes.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.957
I'll take that.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.456
Well -- wh-- Why were
you wiping down tables?

12:34.500 --> 12:36.036
I thought
you got fired.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.206
I did, but I'm going to
keep working for free

12:37.250 --> 12:38.206
until she rehires me.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.958
So now you have two jobs
that don't pay?

12:41.010 --> 12:41.875
That is correct.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.718
Oh, so, Stell!

12:43.760 --> 12:46.138
Uh, we actually wanted
to get your opinion on somet--

12:46.180 --> 12:48.968
Oh, no, we didn't.
We just wanted a cup of coffee.

12:49.010 --> 12:51.559
Uh, Frank's teacher
thinks he's falling behind

12:51.600 --> 12:51.884
and needs
to be held back.

12:51.930 --> 12:54.228
But I am his mom,
and I think he'd be devastated

12:54.270 --> 12:55.806
not to be with Fiona.

12:55.850 --> 12:58.148
Babe,
according to a Harvard study,

12:58.190 --> 12:58.645
there's no harm
in holding back a twin.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.977
Well,
that study is wrong.

13:01.030 --> 13:01.986
Maybe you should
consider it.

13:02.030 --> 13:04.237
When I got sick,
I fell behind,

13:04.280 --> 13:05.156
and it was awful
to go to school

13:05.200 --> 13:07.567
and struggle with things that
came easily to everyone else.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.655
You're my sister.

13:08.700 --> 13:09.235
You're supposed to be
on my side.

13:09.280 --> 13:12.250
Look, what could go wrong?
You've got two kids.

13:12.290 --> 13:14.156
Even if you screw one of them
up, you're still batting .500.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.577
That's pretty good,
right?

13:24.470 --> 13:27.838
Aiden.
What are you doing here?

13:27.890 --> 13:30.507
I'm getting drunk
in my running clothes.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.097
Oh, okay.

13:33.140 --> 13:34.096
How did you get in?
I used my spare key.

13:34.140 --> 13:36.347
You don't have
a spare key.

13:36.390 --> 13:37.846
I do.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.187
We all made copies
when you first moved in.

13:40.230 --> 13:42.779
In case...

13:42.820 --> 13:44.777
Oh.

13:44.820 --> 13:46.527
Cool.

13:46.570 --> 13:49.198
Do you really think that you
should be drinking right now?

13:49.240 --> 13:51.026
Why not?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.866
You're facing a felony
and your hearing is tomorrow.

13:52.910 --> 13:55.459
It seems like the best reason
to be drinking right now.

13:55.500 --> 13:59.710
Aiden, come on.
What are you really doing here?

13:59.750 --> 14:01.036
Look,
you're my sister.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.206
We always have each other's
back, no matter what.

14:05.510 --> 14:09.140
We're best friends,
we tell each other everything.

14:09.180 --> 14:13.219
So...

14:13.270 --> 14:15.807
So...?

14:15.850 --> 14:17.306
So what's up
with you and Wes?

14:17.350 --> 14:19.478
Oh. That.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.477
Yeah, that.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.896
Is it about
the doctor guy?

14:25.940 --> 14:28.068
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.

14:28.110 --> 14:30.738
But...
we're okay.

14:30.780 --> 14:32.077
I mean, we're --
we're good for now, I think.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.999
It's complicated,
but we're better.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.156
See, I knew you
couldn't lie to me.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.575
Nope.
No, I can't.

14:40.130 --> 14:43.589
So, how are you feeling
about tomorrow?

14:43.630 --> 14:45.416
Not amazing.

14:45.460 --> 14:49.340
I just wish there was something
else I could do to help.

14:49.380 --> 14:49.676
Let's go out tonight.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.178
Aiden, that sounds like
a terrible idea.

14:52.220 --> 14:53.597
But I just can't just
sit home and mope.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.428
Well, you can't
show up hungover, either.

14:56.470 --> 14:58.097
You're absolutely right.

14:58.140 --> 15:00.768
I will finish my run
and sober up

15:00.810 --> 15:02.517
before I get to
the bar,

15:02.560 --> 15:07.179
and then I won't drink there,
probably.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.197
All right,
you tell Wes.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.698
I'll tell Lizzie and Diego
that this could be

15:12.740 --> 15:14.697
my last night out
for a while.

15:24.170 --> 15:26.298
Look, this isn't
how we solve problems, Lizzie.

15:26.340 --> 15:28.377
We debate both sides of an
issue, we hear each other out,

15:28.420 --> 15:31.128
we fight, we compromise,
we then have make-up sex.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.966
It's a good system.

15:33.010 --> 15:35.058
- This new one
Is confusing me

15:35.100 --> 15:36.386
"cause I have no idea
when the sex happens.

15:36.430 --> 15:37.886
That's what
it's about for you?

15:37.930 --> 15:41.059
<i>No,
it's about our son.</i>

15:41.100 --> 15:41.384
Yeah.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.647
I really think
that you should hear me out

15:43.690 --> 15:46.978
because I know what it's like
to feel behind.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.067
I was always
the youngest in my class,

15:49.110 --> 15:51.317
I was small
for my age.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.158
It was tough.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.328
And yet,
you turned out to be

15:55.370 --> 15:57.327
one of the best men
I know.

15:57.370 --> 15:59.077
One of the best?

15:59.120 --> 15:59.905
I know
a lot of men.

15:59.950 --> 16:02.248
Look, Lizzie --
This is Aiden.

16:02.290 --> 16:05.169
I got to take this.
Hello?

16:07.630 --> 16:11.260
Wow,
you look beautiful.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.005
So do you.

16:12.050 --> 16:14.758
Not beautiful --
handsome.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.757
Thank you.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.177
I'll get it.

16:19.220 --> 16:20.676
Stella Abbott?
Yeah.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.438
You've been served.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.022
What is this?

16:29.070 --> 16:33.769
It's a subpoena
from the prosecution.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.199
They want you
to testify against Aiden.

16:41.660 --> 16:43.367
They want me to testify
against Aiden?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.536
I'm sure it's just
a scare tactic.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.378
Well,
it's working.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.457
Okay, I'm going to go
talk to Aiden's lawyer.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.877
I'll meet you
at the bar.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.081
Yeah, okay.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.330
Berg: I'm not
really surprised.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.290
Unfortunately,
there's nothing I can do.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.967
Well, there must be
something I can do.

17:00.010 --> 17:01.387
Could I plead the 5th?

17:01.430 --> 17:02.807
The 5th is just used
to protect yourself

17:02.850 --> 17:03.305
from self-recrimination.

17:03.350 --> 17:04.306
I could lie.

17:04.349 --> 17:07.058
And I could be
really good at it.

17:07.109 --> 17:07.144
Good lying
runs in my family.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.477
If you lie under oath,
your mom and dad

17:09.520 --> 17:11.477
will be visiting
two children in jail.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.066
You know,
you're super negative.

17:13.109 --> 17:15.067
Has anyone
ever told you that?

17:15.109 --> 17:16.566
Look,
just be honest with me.

17:16.609 --> 17:18.657
What are
our chances of winning?

17:18.700 --> 17:21.488
Ms. Abbott,
this isn't a horse race.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.326
I can't give you odds,
but I do know

17:23.369 --> 17:25.167
that if your brother
is found guilty,

17:25.210 --> 17:27.497
he'll get
the maximum sentence.

17:27.540 --> 17:27.574
How do you know that?

17:27.630 --> 17:28.916
They assigned our judge,

17:28.960 --> 17:31.918
and she's very tough
on drug offenders.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.257
Did you
tell my father that?

17:33.300 --> 17:35.428
He's the first person
I called.

17:38.470 --> 17:40.507
So what do you think, Wes?
Should we hold Frank back?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.426
Diego, please stop
polling my family.

17:42.470 --> 17:44.848
Our family...

17:44.890 --> 17:46.437
and my best friend.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.188
Look,
I am Switzerland.

17:49.230 --> 17:50.857
If you guys want some
hot chocolate and some clocks,

17:50.900 --> 17:52.857
I'm your guy.

17:52.900 --> 17:56.109
But for now, let's just try
and have a fun night, okay?

17:56.150 --> 17:59.279
Wes, hey!
What are you guys doing here?

17:59.320 --> 17:59.866
Hey.

17:59.910 --> 18:03.540
Um, we're just here to give
Aiden some moral support,

18:03.580 --> 18:06.368
and this is where Dr. Grant's
band's playing, isn't it?

18:06.410 --> 18:08.242
Yes, it is.

18:08.830 --> 18:11.800
Oh,
that is just great.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.126
That is just
the best news possible.

18:13.170 --> 18:15.719
Dr. Sex Fantasy's
in a band?

18:15.760 --> 18:16.716
Hmm.
Did we know this?

18:16.760 --> 18:18.125
We did not.

18:18.180 --> 18:18.544
Hey, I'm going to
grab something from the bar.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.888
Can 1
get you guys anything?

18:20.930 --> 18:22.466
No, we're good.

18:22.510 --> 18:24.217
Okay.
I'll be back.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.385
How's everybody
doing tonight?

18:25.430 --> 18:26.477
All right, all right.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.306
Well, I hope you guys
are insured

18:28.350 --> 18:29.306
because we're about
to knock you out.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.726
I'm sorry, that was
a really bad doctor joke.

18:34.440 --> 18:38.399
So, uh, we're called
Four Doctors and a Mechanic.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.238
That's a great band
name. Is it, though?

18:41.280 --> 18:43.157
Hey.
Hey.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.907
I need to talk to Aiden.
Is he here?

18:44.950 --> 18:47.578
No, not yet,
but good news is

18:47.620 --> 18:48.496
your, uh,
doctor-friend's band's playing.

18:48.540 --> 18:51.749
Huh?

18:51.790 --> 18:52.279
Oh, that's --

18:54.300 --> 18:57.509
I am so sorry.

18:57.550 --> 18:57.914
It's okay.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.428
I'm okay.
Okay.

19:00.470 --> 19:03.599
Okay, well,
I'm going to go call Aiden.

19:08.390 --> 19:11.098
Every time I say goodbye

19:11.150 --> 19:14.359
The time moves slow

19:17.650 --> 19:18.606
Ida, hi.

19:18.650 --> 19:21.699
Hey, guys.

19:21.740 --> 19:22.775
Hi.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.367
Frankie and Fifi
wanted to see grandpa,

19:24.410 --> 19:26.788
and grandma
doesn't like to drink alone.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.537
Grandpa never had
a problem with that.

19:28.580 --> 19:30.787
You want to come in?

19:30.830 --> 19:32.377
Thank you.

19:32.420 --> 19:35.492
I want to hold you

19:38.420 --> 19:40.218
Thank you.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.466
Really great song,
huh?

19:43.510 --> 19:46.719
Mm.
Really great.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.309
So, I guess things
are going pretty well for you

19:49.350 --> 19:51.637
and the good
doctor, huh? Oh, no.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.476
I mean, we're not --
we're just friends.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.318
We had
a really fun date,

19:55.360 --> 19:57.897
but I got the feeling
he was into someone else.

19:57.940 --> 19:59.487
All right,
thank you, guys.

19:59.530 --> 20:01.737
So, uh, this next song is, uh --
it's a love song.

20:01.780 --> 20:05.489
Uh, I wrote it years ago,
SO...

20:05.530 --> 20:06.656
here we go.

20:09.290 --> 20:13.249
No, I didn't see you coming,
so I started running

20:13.290 --> 20:17.329
From the benefit
of the doubt

20:17.380 --> 20:22.329
It's been almost 13 years

20:22.380 --> 20:24.382
But it feels longer

20:26.800 --> 20:30.919
Thought your memory
would just fade away

20:30.980 --> 20:34.769
But it got stronger

20:34.810 --> 20:38.690
And I can't stop
thinking about you

20:38.730 --> 20:41.529
I'm on fire

20:44.070 --> 20:47.950
No, I can't stop
thinking about you

20:47.990 --> 20:50.368
I'm on fire

20:51.750 --> 20:56.620
Any other day, I'd be okay

20:56.670 --> 21:00.550
But tonight,
I'm drinking alone

21:00.590 --> 21:08.008
And I can't stop thinking
about you, can I come home?

21:11.180 --> 21:12.306
Hey, sis.

21:12.350 --> 21:14.478
Sorry I'm late.
Hey.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.397
Hey, I didn't realize
your boyfriend played in a band.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.477
That is not funny.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.897
Look,
we heed to talk.

21:19.940 --> 21:20.896
I went
and saw Mr. Berg.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.567
Why would you do that?

21:22.610 --> 21:25.238
Because I've been subpoenaed
to testify against you,

21:25.280 --> 21:26.566
so you need to talk to Dad
and you need to tell him

21:26.610 --> 21:27.657
that you're gonna
take the plea.

21:27.700 --> 21:28.405
Well,
why would I do that?

21:28.450 --> 21:30.407
Mr. Berg said
I might still get five months,

21:30.450 --> 21:32.248
even if
I'm found guilty.

21:32.290 --> 21:33.439
Not with the judge
you've been assigned, you won't.

21:36.290 --> 21:36.745
Dad didn't tell you.

21:36.790 --> 21:37.746
No.

21:37.790 --> 21:39.997
Mr. Berg said
that she's a hardass

21:40.040 --> 21:40.336
against drug dealers
and that you'll get

21:40.380 --> 21:42.758
the full three years
if you go to trial and you lose.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.007
That can't be right. Dad would
have said something to me.

21:45.050 --> 21:45.425
Not if he's not
thinking straight, he wouldn't.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.428
Why wouldn't he be
thinking straight?

21:52.220 --> 21:53.847
You really think
we can win this?

21:53.890 --> 21:56.473
I know we can.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.015
What?

21:59.060 --> 22:01.643
I've never seen you
fight like this for Aiden.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.106
You're going
above and beyond,

22:06.150 --> 22:09.450
just like you did
when Stella was sick.

22:09.490 --> 22:11.367
It's nice,
which I actually appreciate,

22:11.410 --> 22:14.198
because, Peter...

22:14.250 --> 22:17.288
I'm worried
about our little boy.

22:18.830 --> 22:21.458
Me, too.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.457
You are?

22:23.500 --> 22:26.549
I'm terrified.

22:26.590 --> 22:28.968
Ida, I have to tell you,
I feel so --

22:29.010 --> 22:30.796
Stella: Guilty.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.467
He feels really guilty.

22:33.510 --> 22:35.387
Guilty for what?

22:36.100 --> 22:38.307
What did he do?

22:38.350 --> 22:40.728
Mm. Wait, wait. No, wait.

22:40.770 --> 22:43.728
I'm the reason
Aiden was arrested.

22:43.780 --> 22:44.895
I don't understand.

22:44.940 --> 22:46.897
It was me.
I tipped off the police.

22:46.940 --> 22:48.817
When did you find out
about this?

22:48.860 --> 22:50.908
Yesterday. And
you didn't tell me?!

22:50.950 --> 22:52.486
Seriously, we don't
keep secrets from each other.

22:52.530 --> 22:54.828
Really? That's pretty much
all we've been doing

22:54.870 --> 22:56.577
for the last
eight years.

22:56.620 --> 22:58.247
I lied to you about those things
to protect you.

22:58.290 --> 23:00.418
But that is exactly
what I was doing.

23:00.460 --> 23:01.575
You almost had me
bet my life on Dad.

23:01.630 --> 23:04.418
But I didn't,
and that's the point.

23:04.460 --> 23:06.918
No, the point is
that you lied to me!

23:06.960 --> 23:10.339
And you let me
trust him.

23:10.380 --> 23:11.586
Now I can't trust
either of you.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.177
I have to go.

23:14.220 --> 23:15.426
Where?

23:15.470 --> 23:19.350
Frankie, Fiona,
we're going home.

23:19.390 --> 23:19.515
Last time, you left

23:19.560 --> 23:22.109
because I wasn't being
open and honest with you.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.436
And this time,
you're leaving because I am?

23:23.480 --> 23:24.515
I'm leaving
because I want to

23:24.570 --> 23:27.358
strangle you
with my bare hands

23:27.400 --> 23:27.605
and if I don't leave
this minute,

23:27.650 --> 23:29.527
that is exactly
what I will do.

23:29.570 --> 23:32.779
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

23:32.820 --> 23:34.117
Aiden, wait.
What are you going to do?

23:34.160 --> 23:35.446
What, about the plea?!
I'll take it.

23:35.490 --> 23:37.367
That's what you want
to hear, right?

23:37.410 --> 23:38.787
Yes, but can --
can we talk about it?

23:38.830 --> 23:40.707
You're the last person
in the world

23:40.750 --> 23:41.455
I want
to talk to right now.

23:44.340 --> 23:44.875
All right, thank you, guys,
very much.

23:44.920 --> 23:48.299
We're going to take a quick
break and we will be right back.

23:48.340 --> 23:49.466
Where's Aiden going?

23:55.600 --> 23:57.386
Why would you
tell Aiden that?

23:57.430 --> 23:58.886
Because I was trying
to open his eyes to the fact

23:58.930 --> 24:01.888
that Dad is blinded
by guilt

24:01.940 --> 24:03.476
and he's gambling with
Aiden's life because of it.

24:03.520 --> 24:06.399
Stella,
this is what Dad does.

24:06.440 --> 24:07.646
He swings
for the fences.

24:07.690 --> 24:10.648
He did it for you
when you were sick.

24:10.700 --> 24:13.909
Yeah, but the difference is
I was gonna die.

24:13.950 --> 24:15.486
Aiden still has
his whole life ahead of him,

24:15.530 --> 24:16.736
and I don't want him to lose
three years because of it.

24:16.780 --> 24:19.158
Okay, so you may have
saved him three years,

24:19.200 --> 24:21.157
but you cost him ever
having to take responsibility

24:21.210 --> 24:21.745
for his actions.

24:21.790 --> 24:24.248
Now he can just go ahead
and blame Dad for everything.

24:24.290 --> 24:26.668
Well...

24:26.710 --> 24:28.747
at least I'm trying,
okay?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.086
At least I haven't
given up on him

24:30.130 --> 24:30.915
like the rest of you
obviously have.

24:30.970 --> 24:34.179
That is not fair
and you know it.

24:34.220 --> 24:35.506
Okay, I don't want to fight
right now,

24:35.550 --> 24:38.178
so if you see Wes,
tell him I went home.

24:38.220 --> 24:39.597
Stella.

24:45.060 --> 24:46.858
What the bloody hell
was that?

24:46.900 --> 24:49.608
What was what?

24:49.650 --> 24:49.934
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

24:49.980 --> 24:52.358
No, I-I don't.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.526
You -- You gonna give me
a hint

24:53.570 --> 24:56.528
I'm talking about you
making eyes at my wife

24:56.570 --> 24:58.527
during
your terrible song.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.036
Whoa, okay, first of all,
it's a great song,

25:00.080 --> 25:01.036
and second of all,

25:01.080 --> 25:02.206
I wasn't making eyes
at your wife,

25:02.250 --> 25:05.208
I was playing to a bar
full of people.

25:05.250 --> 25:07.787
Look,
if I was looking at her --

25:07.840 --> 25:08.375
You weren't
looking at her.

25:08.420 --> 25:10.752
You were looking
into her.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.967
Come on, man.

25:15.010 --> 25:15.044
Oh, what?
You're mocking me now.

25:15.090 --> 25:16.387
No,
I'm not mocking you.

25:16.430 --> 25:19.218
I'm not dense, man.
All right?

25:19.260 --> 25:21.467
I know what I saw.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.308
If you ever look at my wife
like that again,

25:24.350 --> 25:24.885
I will not be so polite
next time, do you understand me?

25:24.940 --> 25:26.647
You need to simmer down.
"Simmer down"?!

25:26.690 --> 25:28.476
Don't tell me
to "simmer down".

25:28.520 --> 25:28.895
I'm not
a damn tea pot, mate!

25:28.940 --> 25:31.068
Okay, why don't we
just go inside and --

25:31.110 --> 25:32.100
Will you
get your hands off me?!

25:33.190 --> 25:35.739
<i>Ow!
Whoa!</i>

25:35.780 --> 25:38.909
You okay?
No, I'm not okay!

25:38.950 --> 25:39.826
You just
song-banged my wife

25:39.870 --> 25:40.905
in front of
a bar full of people

25:40.950 --> 25:42.998
and now
I think I've broken my hand.

25:43.040 --> 25:48.490
Well, here, let me take a look at it, okay??
No, you keep my hands off me and off Stella.

25:49.710 --> 25:50.996
Do you understand me?

25:51.050 --> 25:53.667
Yeah,
I understand.

25:53.710 --> 25:54.836
Good.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.177
You need to have a doctor
look at that!

25:56.220 --> 25:58.757
Hey, my drummer's
an orthopedist!

26:01.640 --> 26:03.267
Lizzie, hey.

26:03.310 --> 26:06.439
The science is in
and three out of four doctors

26:06.480 --> 26:09.939
and a mechanic agree
that we should hold Frank back.

26:09.980 --> 26:12.608
Seriously?
You're polling the band now?

26:12.650 --> 26:14.937
Hey, man. Would you mind
taking a look at my finger?

26:14.990 --> 26:16.276
I think
I broke it.

26:16.320 --> 26:16.946
_ Sure.
Wait, wait, wait.

26:16.990 --> 26:19.118
You're a doctor?

26:19.160 --> 26:21.618
I got to say, I would have put
money on you being the mechanic.

26:21.660 --> 26:22.695
Thank you.

26:22.740 --> 26:25.038
Wes: Ow.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.366
Hang tight.
I'm going to have to splint it.

26:28.830 --> 26:30.878
Wes,
what happened?

26:30.920 --> 26:33.457
Oh, nothing.
I just -- 1 -- 1 fell.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.832
You fell
on one finger?

26:37.840 --> 26:38.966
Ah.

26:39.010 --> 26:41.798
Okay,
thank you.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.557
Sure, man.
No problem.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.011
That will be $11,000.

26:56.690 --> 26:59.239
Hey,
Edward Scissorfinger.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.987
Aww.

27:01.030 --> 27:02.156
Diego called.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.828
H-He said
that you fell.

27:04.870 --> 27:08.829
Yeah, I did. I --
Aah.

27:08.870 --> 27:09.166
What happened to you?

27:09.210 --> 27:12.669
I told Aiden
about my dad...

27:12.710 --> 27:13.165
and he freaked.

27:13.210 --> 27:16.840
Oh, speaking of freaked,
your mom called Lizzie,

27:16.880 --> 27:18.462
and now she knows
about your dad, too.

27:20.470 --> 27:23.007
That's just great.

27:23.050 --> 27:25.678
So,
there's no more secrets,

27:25.720 --> 27:28.678
but everyone
hates each other.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.596
So much for coming together
during a crisis.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.859
Yeah, well...

27:32.900 --> 27:36.359
sometimes there's only
so much some people can take.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.449
Well, at least Aiden
is taking the plea.

27:39.490 --> 27:42.278
I mean,
he might hate me forever,

27:42.320 --> 27:44.118
but if the truth saves him
three years of his life,

27:44.160 --> 27:45.571
it's worth it.

27:47.330 --> 27:48.195
Yeah.
Peter: Hey.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.285
Where's Aiden?

27:49.330 --> 27:51.207
What do you mean,
"Where's Aiden?"

27:51.250 --> 27:52.957
Didn't he stay with
you last night? Uh, no.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.286
I thought he would end up
at Lizzie's.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.547
He came home, packed a bag, and
said he was going to your place.

27:56.590 --> 27:58.706
Oh, no.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.750
He ran.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.630
Straight to voicemail.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.750
Okay,
we need to think.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.096
When was the last time
any of you saw him?

28:07.140 --> 28:09.598
At the bar
last night...

28:09.640 --> 28:11.267
when I told him
that Dad tipped off the cops.

28:11.310 --> 28:14.189
I can't believe you did that
the night before his hearing.

28:14.230 --> 28:15.356
Don't blame her.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.105
You should've told him
immediately.

28:16.150 --> 28:18.107
Mom,
you're not helping.

28:18.150 --> 28:18.776
That's fine,
but you don't have...

28:18.820 --> 28:22.108
As I stood there,
I wished we could go back

28:22.150 --> 28:25.029
to the way things were
before Dad's secret came out,

28:25.070 --> 28:27.869
when we were fake-happy
and fake-there-for-each-other,

28:27.910 --> 28:30.959
like when I had cancer.

28:31.000 --> 28:31.956
Okay, listen --

28:32.000 --> 28:33.286
Hey, I got good news.

28:33.330 --> 28:35.537
I can get the hearing
pushed by an hour,

28:35.580 --> 28:39.039
but if Aiden's not here by then,
we're in real trouble.

28:39.090 --> 28:40.046
We have to find him.

28:40.090 --> 28:41.967
He's got no money
and no car.

28:42.010 --> 28:43.375
He couldn't have
gotten very far.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.966
Mom, Dad, don't worry.

28:45.010 --> 28:47.388
We're going to find him.

28:47.430 --> 28:50.138
What?
Hey, I'm not giving up on him.

28:54.690 --> 28:55.896
Thanks, Lizzie.

28:55.940 --> 28:56.224
Yeah, of course.
He's my brother, too.

28:56.270 --> 28:58.227
I'm not going to let him
flee the country

28:58.270 --> 29:00.147
just because he's scared.

29:00.190 --> 29:01.646
Wait, I think I know
where he is.

29:06.530 --> 29:08.908
You scared?

29:08.950 --> 29:09.325
Good.

29:09.370 --> 29:12.328
There would be something
wrong with you if you weren't.

29:12.370 --> 29:15.749
I'm scared, and it's not my
first round of chemo tomorrow.

29:15.790 --> 29:18.839
I don't know if
I can do this, Aiden.

29:23.130 --> 29:25.758
Let's run away.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.336
We can go anywhere.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.346
Shanghai

29:28.390 --> 29:30.506
Darkest Peru?

29:30.560 --> 29:32.767
The ships that leave
from here every day --

29:32.810 --> 29:35.188
we can get on any one of them
and sail off into the sunset.

29:38.480 --> 29:41.029
Just say
the magic words.

29:41.070 --> 29:44.700
That sounds like
a bad idea.

29:44.740 --> 29:47.107
That's them.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.446
If you fall

29:48.490 --> 29:50.697
If you fly

29:50.740 --> 29:54.040
It's so hard

29:54.080 --> 29:58.290
When we're trying to get by

29:58.330 --> 30:02.289
And one day, you will rise

30:02.340 --> 30:08.040
And you'll learn
to dry those eyes

30:08.090 --> 30:12.550
"Cause you'll see
what it's like

30:12.600 --> 30:17.379
To struggle in this life

30:17.440 --> 30:19.807
Now, I won't
sugarcoat this for you.

30:19.860 --> 30:22.727
We are going into
the great unknown.

30:22.780 --> 30:26.899
We're going to be stowaways,
living with rats.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.317
Anything can happen
out there.

30:29.370 --> 30:32.158
Are you sure
you're ready for that?

30:32.200 --> 30:34.157
I am.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.998
Okay.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.748
- You know
what just occurred to me?

30:38.790 --> 30:40.076
If you're brave enough
to run away

30:40.130 --> 30:42.838
and face the unknown,
then...

30:42.880 --> 30:43.915
you're brave enough
to face

30:43.960 --> 30:45.837
whatever
you're running away from.

30:45.880 --> 30:48.759
"Cause I'll be here
by your side

30:48.800 --> 30:50.586
You're stronger
than you know.

30:50.640 --> 30:58.640
Whatever you do,
I'll be here

30:59.980 --> 31:01.141
There he is.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.527
Stella:
Where you headed?

31:07.570 --> 31:10.107
Bora Bora?
Darkest Peru?

31:10.160 --> 31:11.696
Snowiest Alaska.

31:11.740 --> 31:13.868
What are you
going to do in Alaska?

31:13.910 --> 31:15.867
I don't --
be an Uber sled driver.

31:15.910 --> 31:20.529
Alaska's still
in America, dork.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.287
They can still
arrest you there.

31:22.330 --> 31:25.209
It turns out,
there's no international ships

31:25.250 --> 31:27.378
that leave from here.

31:27.420 --> 31:28.125
You still mad at me?

31:28.170 --> 31:32.539
Yes,
but more so at Dad.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.137
You should be mad
at yourself,

31:35.180 --> 31:37.729
You did this,
Aiden.

31:37.770 --> 31:38.384
This isn't all on him.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.387
Of course
you would say that.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.477
Yeah,
perfect Lizzie --

31:42.520 --> 31:44.227
everything you did
made Dad happy.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.477
You've no idea
what that man's really like.

31:46.530 --> 31:47.986
You don't think
he was hard on me?

31:48.030 --> 31:49.987
Come on.

31:50.030 --> 31:51.236
If I got a B,

31:51.280 --> 31:53.817
he'd come down on me
like a ton of bricks.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.486
If you got a C,
he'd buy you an ice-cream cake.

31:55.530 --> 31:57.749
That happened once.

31:57.790 --> 32:00.327
Okay, Dad was way tougher on me
than he was on you.

32:00.370 --> 32:02.361
He was tough
on all of us.

32:03.540 --> 32:07.625
Stella. You were
always his favorite.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.007
I was.

32:12.470 --> 32:13.005
He might have been tough
on you, Lizzie,

32:13.050 --> 32:16.839
but...
he gave up on me.

32:16.890 --> 32:19.518
No,
Dad doesn't give up.

32:19.560 --> 32:20.766
With my cancer,
he never did.

32:20.810 --> 32:23.598
He fought for me
every single day.

32:23.650 --> 32:28.019
And I know,
as misguided as he seems...

32:28.070 --> 32:29.526
he's really
fighting for you right now.

32:29.570 --> 32:32.198
Dad's not perfect,
but he was really trying.

32:32.240 --> 32:37.019
I mean, he's been trying
your whole life.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.196
Can you say
the same thing?

32:39.240 --> 32:41.618
Oh, I hate it
when you're right

32:41.660 --> 32:43.788
'cause I know
you love it so much.

32:43.830 --> 32:46.037
I do
love it so much.

32:52.090 --> 32:53.876
I'm really scared.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.055
Well, yeah.

32:58.100 --> 33:00.637
There would be something wrong
with you if you weren't.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.889
But a wise man
once told me

33:03.940 --> 33:06.477
that if you're brave enough
to run away,

33:06.520 --> 33:08.898
then you are brave enough
to face whatever it is

33:08.940 --> 33:10.647
you're running away from.

33:10.690 --> 33:13.489
I like it.
Who said that?

33:13.530 --> 33:15.908
You did.
I did?

33:15.950 --> 33:17.315
Mm-hmm.

33:17.370 --> 33:18.656
That doesn't sound
like me.

33:18.700 --> 33:20.657
We were sitting
right here.

33:20.700 --> 33:23.658
No, seriously,
you don't remember saying that?

33:23.710 --> 33:24.324
No!

33:24.370 --> 33:26.748
Hey, in my defense, I've smoked
a lot of pot since then.

33:26.790 --> 33:29.248
Mm.
This is true.

33:29.290 --> 33:31.839
Okay.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.713
Let's go back.

33:34.760 --> 33:37.081
Come on.

33:39.970 --> 33:42.678
Ooh.

34:01.330 --> 34:03.537
All I'm asking for
is @ 24-hour extension.

34:08.460 --> 34:09.699
Judge Cramer's calling us
into court.

34:09.750 --> 34:11.081
I'm sorry, folks.
Time's up.

34:11.130 --> 34:13.007
The trial starts now,
whether Aiden's here or not.

34:13.050 --> 34:14.005
She can't do that.

34:14.050 --> 34:15.666
Well, I'm afraid
she can -- hey!

34:15.719 --> 34:18.428
Peter, don't.

34:18.469 --> 34:21.757
Mr. Berg,
get your client out of here.

34:21.810 --> 34:22.504
Your Honor, I can't
let you do this.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.348
You are making things worse
for your son.

34:25.389 --> 34:27.188
I've been doing it
for the last 27 years.

34:27.230 --> 34:28.766
Why stop now?

34:28.810 --> 34:31.359
It's my fault
Aiden's not here.

34:31.400 --> 34:34.609
In fact,
it's my fault he's in this mess,

34:34.650 --> 34:37.779
and not just because
I tipped off the police...

34:37.820 --> 34:39.697
You did?

34:39.739 --> 34:43.040
It was the latest mistake
in a lifetime full of them.

34:43.080 --> 34:43.614
I love my son,
Your Honor.

34:43.659 --> 34:47.699
I probably should have
told him that more often, but...

34:47.750 --> 34:50.208
a lot of things
I should have done.

34:50.250 --> 34:51.536
I knew
Aiden was off-track

34:51.590 --> 34:55.049
and he needed a little nudge
to get back on,

34:55.090 --> 34:57.502
but instead,
I shoved him to the ground.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.751
I think
I may have broken him.

35:04.010 --> 35:06.559
He deserved a better father
than I knew how to be.

35:06.600 --> 35:10.810
He still does -- Lizzie:
You were a great father.

35:10.850 --> 35:13.820
To all of us,
in different ways.

35:13.860 --> 35:15.567
Yeah, Dad.

35:15.610 --> 35:17.487
You were so busy
taking care of me,

35:17.530 --> 35:20.158
you just lost sight
of everything else.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.986
You all did.
Especially you, Aiden.

35:22.030 --> 35:23.987
You gave me so much,
you just...

35:24.030 --> 35:25.156
kind of lost yourself.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.577
All right, stop.

35:26.620 --> 35:28.748
Guys, seriously,
I can't listen to you

35:28.790 --> 35:30.918
take credit
for my mistakes.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.837
Your Honor, I need to speak
with my client outside.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.417
I know you don't want me to say
anything, but this is on me.

35:35.460 --> 35:38.669
I blew it big time, and for
the first time in my life,

35:38.720 --> 35:40.677
I'm ready to face
the consequences.

35:40.720 --> 35:41.755
Aiden, don't.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.598
I am sorry
for what I did.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.506
I am sorry
I made you worry

35:45.560 --> 35:47.597
and that
I made you angry.

35:47.640 --> 35:50.849
And that
I made you scared.

35:50.890 --> 35:53.609
The truth is,
Your Honor, I'm guilty.

35:53.650 --> 35:59.851
I sold drugs,
and I let you guys down.

35:59.900 --> 36:01.106
And there's nothing
you could do to me

36:01.150 --> 36:05.360
that is going to make me
feel worse than knowing that.

36:05.410 --> 36:09.449
I can send you to jail for
3 years and fine you $250,000.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.867
Wow,
that's pretty close.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.787
All right,
all of you, out.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.081
Mr. Berg,
grab the DA, please.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.593
Can we talk?

36:32.770 --> 36:33.760
I'm sorry,
Aiden.

36:36.770 --> 36:37.475
Hey, I'm not the only one
who deserved better.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.989
You did, too.

36:40.030 --> 36:42.146
I'm sorry I made you feel like
you had no other choice

36:42.200 --> 36:44.407
but to turn me in.

36:44.450 --> 36:46.487
And for putting the cereal
spoons back in the drawer

36:46.530 --> 36:50.160
without washing them.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.248
I did that
with the forks.

36:57.710 --> 36:59.917
Berg: Hey!

36:59.960 --> 37:01.257
We're in.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.678
Mr. Abbott,
the pills you were selling,

37:03.720 --> 37:05.085
when abused,
kill people.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.677
And because of that,
I'm inclined to impose

37:07.720 --> 37:10.269
the maximum sentence
of three years in prison.

37:10.310 --> 37:12.847
But I've made
a recommendation,

37:12.890 --> 37:15.097
and your lawyer
and the DA have agreed.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.187
In return
for pleading guilty

37:17.230 --> 37:18.015
to the lesser charge
of possession,

37:18.070 --> 37:21.188
you will receive a sentence
of one year in prison.

37:21.230 --> 37:23.449
One year?!

37:23.490 --> 37:26.027
To be suspended
for 51 weeks,

37:26.070 --> 37:31.236
which means he'll spend one week
in county jail.

37:31.290 --> 37:31.950
Do you accept?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.536
Yes.

37:33.580 --> 37:35.787
You're a lucky man,
Mr. Abbott...

37:35.830 --> 37:38.128
in more ways
than one.

37:38.170 --> 37:39.205
Yeah.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.207
So, I urge you
to use the second chance

37:41.250 --> 37:43.719
to become the person
that they think you can be.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.127
And if you don't,
next time,

37:46.180 --> 37:47.887
I will crush you
like a bug.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.466
Thank you,
Your Honor.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.477
Ooh,
not so fast.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.649
We're not done yet.

37:56.690 --> 37:58.306
You will also serve
150 hours of community service,

37:58.360 --> 38:00.226
you will...

38:00.270 --> 38:02.648
I always thought my family
was best in a crisis...

38:02.690 --> 38:04.146
...you will remain sober.

38:04.190 --> 38:05.146
There's a hole
in the drywall

38:05.200 --> 38:08.158
...but here we were...

38:08.200 --> 38:10.157
Still not fixed
...after one...

38:10.200 --> 38:12.658
I just haven't gotten

38:12.700 --> 38:14.828
...still together...

38:14.870 --> 38:15.826
Around to it

38:15.870 --> 38:18.248
And besides, starting to...

38:18.290 --> 38:20.418
...even though
we were all a bit broken.

38:20.460 --> 38:24.010
...get used to to the gaps

38:28.800 --> 38:35.012
Say you wish you could find
some way to live

38:35.060 --> 38:37.267
They really
love each other, D.

38:37.310 --> 38:38.186
I know.

38:38.230 --> 38:41.018
I think that's why
I don't want to split them up.

38:41.060 --> 38:44.519
Life is going to do that anyway,
so why start now?

38:44.570 --> 38:46.186
It's not
going to happen.

38:46.240 --> 38:49.278
That's what happened with me
and Stella and Aiden.

38:49.320 --> 38:53.860
We all used to be so close,
and then...

38:53.910 --> 38:55.287
life happened.

38:55.330 --> 38:57.708
Well, I think you're doing
pretty well,

38:57.750 --> 38:59.286
all things considered.
Yeah?

38:59.330 --> 39:00.456
Yeah.
I guess.

39:02.500 --> 39:02.784
Look,
I just don't want to be

39:02.840 --> 39:06.879
the reason why
our kids drift apart.

39:06.920 --> 39:09.719
Ho-- How about
we compromise?

39:09.760 --> 39:10.636
We will keep an eye on Frank
for the rest of the year,

39:10.680 --> 39:12.796
and if
we see him struggling,

39:12.850 --> 39:16.639
we will revisit
the issue, okay?

39:16.680 --> 39:19.388
Yeah.
More than okay.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.978
Good.
Good.

39:23.020 --> 39:25.318
So, is this when
the makeup sex happens?

39:25.360 --> 39:27.237
Yeah.
Ooh.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.816
It is.

39:28.860 --> 39:31.909
Mm, we're in
a public park.

39:31.950 --> 39:32.815
Yeah.

39:32.870 --> 39:33.826
Let's go!
Let's go!

39:33.870 --> 39:36.578
One, two, three,
let's go!

39:36.620 --> 39:39.248
What'll it be today, Jasper?

39:39.290 --> 39:41.748
Six extra-large cappuccinos
with almond milk

39:41.790 --> 39:43.087
and a double shot of --

39:43.130 --> 39:45.667
Your free month
of coffee is up.

39:45.710 --> 39:47.007
I will have
one drip, please.

39:47.050 --> 39:48.757
Cool.
Stella, you on that?

39:48.800 --> 39:51.588
Yeah.
Yes, really?

39:51.640 --> 39:52.675
Does that mean
that I have my --

39:52.720 --> 39:54.006
What is this?

39:54.050 --> 39:55.597
It's backpay
for this last week.

39:55.640 --> 39:57.096
I pled your case
to my dad,

39:57.140 --> 40:00.849
and he was like,
"Get out, I'm watchin' TV!"

40:00.890 --> 40:01.686
So I read
between the lines

40:01.730 --> 40:04.267
- and decided that meant
it was okay to rehire you.

40:04.310 --> 40:06.017
Thank you.

40:06.070 --> 40:09.108
I'm glad to
officially have you back.

40:09.150 --> 40:11.027
I kind of missed you.
Mm, no, you didn't.

40:11.070 --> 40:13.448
No, I didn't
"cause you never really left.

40:13.490 --> 40:16.539
But maybe
I would have.

40:16.910 --> 40:19.447
Come on in.

40:19.500 --> 40:19.693
Okay.

40:19.750 --> 40:23.709
I'm going to love you
till the well runs dry

40:23.750 --> 40:25.787
You really did
get off easy.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.706
Easy?!

40:27.750 --> 40:30.128
I got a week in jail,
150 hours of community service,

40:30.170 --> 40:32.377
6 months
of 12-step meetings,

40:32.430 --> 40:35.218
and I have to wear
a tracking anklet with a curfew.

40:35.260 --> 40:39.140
I would say
she threw the book at me.

40:39.180 --> 40:44.971
Okay, maybe it was a novella
or a brochure, a pamphlet.

40:45.020 --> 40:48.229
So, we were all
facing the truth head-on,

40:48.280 --> 40:49.725
no matter how difficult
it might be.

40:49.780 --> 40:53.489
And now I had to do the same.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.737
I'm gonna give you
all I have inside

40:57.780 --> 40:58.986
Wes?

40:59.040 --> 41:02.408
Mm
All my days

41:02.460 --> 41:05.077
How did you really
hurt your hand?

41:05.130 --> 41:08.748
I'm gonna love you
till the well runs dry

41:08.800 --> 41:13.089
I, um --

41:13.130 --> 41:15.929
I got in a fight
with Dr. Grant.

41:15.970 --> 41:20.669
Well, a dumpster
Dr. Grant was standing next to.

41:20.720 --> 41:24.270
I saw how he looked at you
in the bar,

41:24.310 --> 41:27.610
how you
looked at him.

41:31.070 --> 41:33.107
And I'm I'm not okay.

41:33.150 --> 41:36.609
I know I said
that time can fix this, but...

41:36.660 --> 41:38.776
I was wrong.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.946
You're right.

41:40.990 --> 41:45.359
If you want to be with me,
then you need to fix this.

41:45.420 --> 41:49.789
I'm going to love you
till the well runs dry

41:49.840 --> 41:51.490
What do you want me
to do?
