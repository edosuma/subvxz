02:47.040 --> 02:49.508
Welcome to the Hyatt Jeddah.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.669
<i>I need you shiny
and bright here, Alan.</i>

03:11.080 --> 03:13.674
Look, we both know
the only reason you got this job

03:13.760 --> 03:15.955
is your connection
to the king's nephew.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.395
You're in charge of a deal
that's pivotal for the company,

03:18.480 --> 03:20.550
which makes it
even more pivotal for you.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.552
But you've got more questions
than answers here.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.193
And that makes me
uncomfortable.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.236
There are unanswered
questions here

03:27.320 --> 03:30.198
because I haven't
been to Saudi yet.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.998
I can't presume to know
the lay of the land

03:32.080 --> 03:34.514
or the state
of the king's mind.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.034
You've been on the bench
for a while, Alan.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.394
This isn't
the Schwinn days.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.869
You're not selling
bicycles to kids anymore.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.157
So I need to know
that you're on point,

03:44.240 --> 03:45.878
that you're going
to close this.

03:47.240 --> 03:49.071
This is sales.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.559
You make estimates.

03:50.640 --> 03:51.959
And you make plans.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.270
But then you get there
and everything changes.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.555
But you make the sale.

04:12.040 --> 04:15.237
I know, I'm sorry.
I got in really late last night

04:15.320 --> 04:16.798
and I forgot
to set the alarm.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.055
<i>Don't worry, we're just getting set up.</i>

04:19.079 --> 04:21.719
<i>Hold on. Do you guys know how
Alan can get a ride out here?</i>

04:21.800 --> 04:23.336
<i>Maybe he should rent a car.</i>

04:23.360 --> 04:25.396
<i>- Can you rent a car, Alan?</i>
- I'll figure it out.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.392
<i>- Front desk.</i>
- This is Alan Clay. Who am I speaking with?

04:28.480 --> 04:31.517
<i>- My name is Edward, sir.</i>
- Edward. Where are you from, Edward?

04:31.600 --> 04:34.592
<i>- Jakarta, Indonesia, sir.</i>
- Jakarta!

04:34.680 --> 04:37.558
Indonesia. Edward,
what would you think

04:37.640 --> 04:39.517
of me renting a car
through the hotel?

04:39.600 --> 04:41.556
<i>Do you have an international
driver's license?</i>

04:41.640 --> 04:42.834
<i>No, I don't.</i>

04:42.920 --> 04:45.514
<i>Then, no, I don't think it
would be possible to do this.</i>

04:45.600 --> 04:48.353
- Well, could I hire a car and a driver, then?
<i>- Where to?</i>

04:48.440 --> 04:52.672
The King's Metropolis
of Economy and Trade.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.709
Morning.

05:15.240 --> 05:18.232
Excuse me.

05:21.720 --> 05:25.030
- Are you Alan Clay?
- Are you the driver?

05:25.120 --> 05:28.669
Driver, guide, hero.
Yousef.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.830
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not a chauffeur.
Get in the front.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.871
There's a water,
if you like.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.957
You sure this thing
will get us there?

05:45.040 --> 05:48.077
I drive this thing
to Riyadh all the time.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.555
It never fails me.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.359
Just one second.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.915
- So, everything's okay?
- Oh, yeah, no.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.753
I just had to disconnect the engine
before I came into the lobby.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.559
- Why?
- To make sure no one wires it.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.077
You mean hot-wires it
to steal it?

06:17.160 --> 06:19.628
No, I mean wiring it
to explode.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.871
No, no.
It's nothing terroristic.

06:23.960 --> 06:27.270
This... just this guy who
thinks I'm screwing his wife.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.679
He might be trying
to kill me.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.160
Here we go.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.717
- So, I'm in a car that might explode?
- No, no, no, no, no.

06:38.800 --> 06:42.475
It's nothing to worry about. I don't think
he knows how to wire a car that way.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.120
He's not a tough guy,
he's just rich.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.158
It would only be possible
if he hired someone.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.318
If you were
this rich guy,

06:55.400 --> 06:58.312
you would hire someone
to wire the car

06:58.400 --> 07:00.356
of the man screwing
your wife, yes?

07:02.440 --> 07:05.637
Fuck. Now you
got me scared.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.431
Anyway, Alan?
Where are you from?

07:17.520 --> 07:19.351
Boston.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.829
Ah, yeah, Boston.

07:21.960 --> 07:25.919
I've been to Alabama.
One year of college.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.911
- You studied in Alabama?
- Yeah.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.399
Why Alabama?

07:29.480 --> 07:31.835
You mean because I was the
only Arab for 1,000 miles?

07:33.480 --> 07:36.552
I had a scholarship for
one year in Birmingham.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.756
- Birmingham?
- Yeah.

07:38.840 --> 07:41.115
Oh, I like Birmingham.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.634
Are you hungry?
You want something to eat?

07:43.720 --> 07:47.156
You mean like stop at a restaurant?
We just got in the car.

07:47.240 --> 07:51.279
- We could go to a place in the old city.
- No, I'm in a hurry, remember?

07:51.360 --> 07:55.114
Oh, you're late?
No, they didn't tell me you were late.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.397
No, we should be going
this way if you're late.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.676
<i>- Do you like Chicago?
- Not in the winter.</i>

08:08.800 --> 08:11.997
- No, the band.
- Oh.

08:14.920 --> 08:20.278
<i>♫ You know our love
was meant to be ♫</i>

08:20.360 --> 08:24.114
<i>♫ The kind of love
to last forever... ♫</i>

08:24.200 --> 08:27.476
<i>- How long is the drive?
- To KMET?</i>

08:27.560 --> 08:30.916
- What?
- The King's Metropolis of Economy and Trade.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.514
- We call it KMET.
- Yes, to KMET.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.953
Is that where
we're going?

08:36.480 --> 08:38.549
Just kidding.

08:38.640 --> 08:39.470
It's about an hour.

08:39.559 --> 08:42.756
- What time you supposed to be there?
- Eight, eight-thirty.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.319
- Oh.
- ♫ Everywhere I go... ♫

08:44.400 --> 08:47.676
- You'll be there at noon.
- ♫ Always on my mind... ♫

08:47.760 --> 08:50.513
- Hey, want a mint?
- ♫ In my heart, in my soul... ♫

08:50.600 --> 08:51.476
No?

08:51.560 --> 08:55.439
♫ Baby, you're the meaning
in my life ♫

08:56.640 --> 08:58.756
Hey, you know what?
I don't like Chicago.

08:58.840 --> 09:03.118
Oh. Okay.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.316
Let's see what else
we have on here, huh?

09:11.720 --> 09:14.837
Oh.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.840
<i>- Hey, so, why are you going to KMET?
- Work.</i>

09:24.960 --> 09:29.112
<i>- Ah, you're in construction?
- No, I'm in IT.</i>

09:29.200 --> 09:32.476
Ah, IT. But you know there's
nothing happening there.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.074
- Well, not yet.
- No, not ever.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.958
I've done my due diligence.
I'm presenting out there.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.359
It's full steam ahead.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.079
Okay.
See for yourself.

10:00.960 --> 10:05.351
<i>Look, they're sweeping sand in a desert.</i>

10:10.360 --> 10:13.955
I'm guessing
these aren't union men.

10:14.040 --> 10:18.238
Oh, we don't have unions here.
We have Filipinos.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.559
- Ah, Mr. Clay?
- Yes.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.438
We've been expecting you.
I'm Sayed.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.397
Sayed.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.311
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

10:52.400 --> 10:54.630
I'm sorry to hear that
you missed the shuttle.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.995
I understand the hotel
had some trouble waking you.

10:57.080 --> 11:00.231
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- The king won't be coming today.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.437
So your tardiness
is inconsequential.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.875
Is my Relyand team
somewhere in here?

11:05.960 --> 11:07.951
No, they're in
the presentation area.

11:08.040 --> 11:12.272
- Follow me. Some juice?
- Oh, thank you.

11:12.400 --> 11:18.953
So, Mr. Clay, allow me to conjure
Our Majesty's dream.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.951
This is where
we are right now.

11:21.040 --> 11:25.795
And this is the city
in the year 2025.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.589
Hosting a minimum
of 1.5 million.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.600
Port is there.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.837
Industrial city.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.992
University.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.071
Business center.

11:48.160 --> 11:51.072
Life and leisure park.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.674
Very impressive.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.200
I have to go.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.072
Here, in case
you sleep in again.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.271
Full steam ahead!

12:19.400 --> 12:23.075
We'll see you at 3:00.
Over there in the main building.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.709
Ask for Karim Al-Ahmad.
He's your primary contact.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.109
- My team is in there?
- Yes.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.034
- In a tent?
- Yes. I trust you'll find everything inside.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.599
Howdy.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.112
There he is.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.474
Hey.

13:36.560 --> 13:39.632
- Cayley. Brad. Good to see you.
- Alan.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.119
- Rachel.
- Welcome.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.351
So, how are you guys
doing in here?

13:44.440 --> 13:47.113
Fine, but we can't
get a Wi-Fi signal.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.952
Except for a faint one
from that big pagoda.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.268
I mean
the office building.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.557
- Asked anyone about it?
- We figured we'd wait for you.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.949
We've been trying
to e-mail Karim.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.838
Karim Al-Ahmad.
I have a meeting with him at 3:00.

13:58.920 --> 14:02.196
- That's great.
- Which is soon.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.788
Yeah, that's
not gonna work.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.792
- But what if the king arrives today?
- He won't.

14:07.880 --> 14:08.880
I was told
he wouldn't.

14:08.960 --> 14:12.509
- Oh, good.
- And you've met him before?

14:12.600 --> 14:16.149
The king?
No. No, no, no. I...

14:16.240 --> 14:18.629
I just met his nephew.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.358
And that
was years ago.

14:20.440 --> 14:25.833
<i>- Was he a prince?
- Yeah. Yes, he was.</i>

14:25.920 --> 14:28.673
<i>And he still is.</i>

14:32.440 --> 14:34.670
What do you call
a fish with no eye?

14:36.560 --> 14:40.314
- I don't know.
- Fshshsh.

14:44.600 --> 14:49.355
Anyway, look, the king is not coming today.
So you guys can just relax.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.715
Shouldn't we call corporate
and let them know

14:51.800 --> 14:53.233
that conditions here
are untenable?

14:53.320 --> 14:57.916
No, Brad, we should wait until I
talk to Karim Al-Ahmad at 3:00.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.679
Do you know why we're
not in that building?

15:00.760 --> 15:02.398
Well, maybe all the
vendors are in here.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.879
And maybe
we're just the first.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.155
Kind of weird being Relyand
and being out here.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.429
It's a brand-new city.

15:07.520 --> 15:11.069
It's uncharted territory.
And we are the trailblazers.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.878
Where are we
supposed to eat?

15:12.960 --> 15:18.273
Guys, come on!
We are in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

15:18.360 --> 15:22.194
With the deserts and the camels
and the sheikhs and the tents!

15:22.280 --> 15:23.759
Oh!

15:23.840 --> 15:25.751
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

15:25.840 --> 15:27.353
Yeah.
Don't you know?

15:27.440 --> 15:30.000
They can only kill me
with a golden bullet.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.117
Golden bullet,
you get it?

15:39.680 --> 15:41.272
It's "Lawrence of Arabia"?

15:42.120 --> 15:43.348
Who?

16:06.880 --> 16:08.711
- Hello there.
- Hello.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.598
- What is your name?
- My name is Maha.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.275
Maha. Great.
Where are you from?

16:16.160 --> 16:18.628
My name
is Alan Clay.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.760
I'm with
the Relyand Group.

16:19.840 --> 16:20.989
I have an appointment
at 3:00

16:21.080 --> 16:22.593
to speak
to Mr. Karim Al-Ahmad.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.069
I'm sorry to say
he's stuck in Jeddah.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.480
He won't be able
to make it today.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.278
- He's stuck in Jeddah?
- Yes, sir.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.157
But he said he'll be here
tomorrow all day

16:30.240 --> 16:31.816
and you can name the time
you want to meet.

16:31.840 --> 16:35.196
Oh, okay, but I'm
with the Relyand Group

16:35.280 --> 16:38.238
and we are out
in that tent down there.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.760
And we can't get
a good Wi-Fi signal,

16:39.840 --> 16:41.336
which is essential
to our presentation.

16:41.360 --> 16:44.636
I think Mr. Al-Ahmad will be the
one to speak to about this.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.518
- He's in charge of the vendors in the tent.
- Understood.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.955
And any time tomorrow
will be fine.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.237
It will all get sorted,
I'm sure.

16:53.320 --> 16:56.949
Okay.
Thank you, Maha.

17:19.880 --> 17:23.792
You don't know how to pay for college?
Sell the house.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.348
How long does it take to
sell this fucking house?

17:26.480 --> 17:28.710
- Ruby, I can't change the real estate...
- Bullshit!

17:28.800 --> 17:30.438
Just sell it,
for Christ's sakes.

17:30.520 --> 17:35.275
Then pay for your daughter's education.
College is your thing.

17:37.520 --> 17:41.433
- Welcome to the Hyatt Jeddah.
- Good night, guys. See you in the morning.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.636
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Alan. I've got Eric Randall for you.</i>

17:44.720 --> 17:47.598
- Okay, great.
<i>- What do you mean he didn't show up?</i>

17:47.680 --> 17:48.800
Well, he got stuck
in Jeddah.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.354
It's tomorrow now,
but we'll be fine, I'm sure.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.936
<i>Okay, but don't forget to call me
first thing after that meeting.</i>

17:53.960 --> 17:56.520
<i>- I've got Mike Winston on the other line.
- Oh, put him through.</i>

18:25.640 --> 18:27.596
Hello, Kitty.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.515
<i>Hey, Dad. I hope your trip
is going well.</i>

18:31.600 --> 18:34.592
<i>Is it hot over there?
A little dusty?</i>

18:34.680 --> 18:37.399
<i>That's a joke.
I'm a joker.</i>

18:37.480 --> 18:42.395
<i>Everything is fine here.
Not totally fine.</i>

18:42.480 --> 18:43.754
<i>Mom called last night</i>

18:43.840 --> 18:46.912
<i>and wanted to do what
she always wants to do...</i>

18:47.000 --> 18:48.638
<i>blame you for everything.</i>

18:48.720 --> 18:51.871
<i>But I'm fine missing
a semester or two of college.</i>

18:51.960 --> 18:53.109
I'm so sorry, Kitty.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.918
<i>It's actually doing me good.</i>

18:55.000 --> 18:57.673
Dad. It's okay.

18:57.760 --> 19:01.912
I can use the break to rack up some
extra tip money. I'm good at this.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.152
Yeah, but don't get used to it.
You're going to college.

19:07.120 --> 19:11.193
<i>Listen, Dad. I trust you.
Don't listen to Mom.</i>

19:11.280 --> 19:16.274
<i>She said, "What's he doing in the desert?
His problems are here."</i>

19:16.360 --> 19:18.430
<i>I told her that
you know what you're doing.</i>

19:18.520 --> 19:21.432
<i>And then she gets on me
for taking your side.</i>

19:21.520 --> 19:26.196
<i>She says I'm like you,
can't see the big picture, lacking ambition.</i>

19:26.280 --> 19:27.952
<i>The usual bullshit.</i>

19:28.040 --> 19:33.114
<i>Maybe just
prove her wrong, Dad.</i>

19:33.200 --> 19:35.555
<i>Prove her wrong.</i>

19:35.640 --> 19:37.995
<i>- Front desk.</i>
- This is Alan Clay.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.389
Is it possible for me
to get a beer or something?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.311
<i>I'm sorry, sir,
but consuming alcohol</i>

19:42.400 --> 19:45.153
<i>is strictly prohibited
in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</i>

19:45.240 --> 19:46.958
Ah, yes, of course.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.993
- How about a Diet Coke?
<i>- Diet Pepsi?</i>

19:52.120 --> 19:54.429
Sure, okay.
Thanks.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.279
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, Dad. It's Alan.

20:05.360 --> 20:08.477
<i>Alan? You sound like
you're on the moon.</i>

20:08.600 --> 20:10.716
No, I'm in Saudi Arabia.

20:10.800 --> 20:14.076
<i>Oh, what are you doing
in Saudi Arabia?</i>

20:14.160 --> 20:17.197
Well, it's actually
pretty interesting, Dad.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.320
I'm here with Relyand,

20:18.400 --> 20:23.918
and we're pitching a new
IT system to the king.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.878
We have this remarkable
teleconferencing equipment

20:26.960 --> 20:29.599
and we're presenting
to the king himself.

20:29.680 --> 20:33.036
It's a three-dimensional
holographic meeting...

20:33.120 --> 20:36.112
<i>Know what I'm watching
on TV here, Alan?</i>

20:36.200 --> 20:37.918
No, what are you watching?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.479
I'm watching this thing

20:39.560 --> 20:43.439
on how a gigantic bridge
in Oakland, California,

20:43.520 --> 20:46.796
is being built in China.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.791
Can you imagine that?

20:48.880 --> 20:51.440
They're building
our goddamn bridges.

20:51.560 --> 20:55.872
<i>I got to say, Alan,
when you took Schwinn over there to China</i>

20:55.960 --> 20:58.554
<i>and sacked 900
of our homeland people,</i>

20:58.640 --> 21:00.596
<i>I could see
the rest of it coming.</i>

21:00.680 --> 21:05.196
Makes sense if you're some
shitass bloodthirsty executive

21:05.280 --> 21:09.592
hell-bent on hollowing out
the economy for his own gain.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.591
<i>Nature of the beast.</i>

21:11.680 --> 21:15.116
<i>But the bridges?
I did not see it coming.</i>

21:15.200 --> 21:19.079
<i>Oh, Lord, and you're
over there in Saudi Arabia...</i>

21:19.160 --> 21:22.630
- Dad, you're breaking up.
- ...selling holograms to the pharaohs!

21:22.760 --> 21:25.320
- Are you there, Dad? You're breaking up.
- Now that takes the...

21:31.840 --> 21:34.354
Oh, damn it.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.799
God damn it.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.634
- I missed my shuttle again.
<i>- But it's my day off.</i>

22:02.720 --> 22:05.473
<i>Just kidding. I'm available.</i>

22:05.560 --> 22:08.074
- How long do you need?
<i>- 17 minutes.</i>

22:08.160 --> 22:09.388
Make it 23.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.278
You were in the lobby
for, what, five minutes?

22:15.360 --> 22:17.635
What kind of bomb could anyone
install in five minutes?

22:17.720 --> 22:21.190
How would I know?
I watch the same TV shows as you.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.557
- Ready?
- Don't make it more dramatic.

22:31.440 --> 22:34.079
Whew.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.550
- Hey, you like Electric Light Orchestra?
- Yeah.

22:40.800 --> 22:44.190
<i>♫ The city streets
are empty now ♫</i>

22:44.280 --> 22:47.192
<i>♫ The lights
don't shine no more ♫</i>

22:47.280 --> 22:50.750
<i>♫ And so the songs
are way down low... ♫</i>

22:50.840 --> 22:53.195
<i>Hey, that's the mosque
I see from my balcony.</i>

22:53.280 --> 22:54.936
There was something
going on there yesterday.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.793
- A lot of people.
- Yeah, that's where they do the executions.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.677
You mean outside,
publicly?

23:02.760 --> 23:03.875
Yes.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.896
You want to go back and check
out what's going on now?

23:05.920 --> 23:07.638
No! No.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.395
Hey, do you mind?

23:12.480 --> 23:13.595
Not at all.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.750
<i>♫ Turnin' to stone
'cause you ain't comin' home ♫</i>

23:15.840 --> 23:17.896
<i>♫ Why you ain't comin' home
if I'm turning to stone? ♫</i>

23:17.920 --> 23:20.195
<i>♫ You've been gone for so long
and I can't carry on ♫</i>

23:20.280 --> 23:23.716
<i>♫ Yes, I'm turning, I'm turning,
I'm turning to stone ♫</i>

23:25.200 --> 23:28.476
<i>♫ The dancing shadows
on the wall ♫</i>

23:28.560 --> 23:31.518
<i>♫ The two-step in the hall ♫</i>

23:31.600 --> 23:35.673
<i>♫ Are all I see
since you've been gone ♫</i>

23:35.760 --> 23:38.593
<i>♫ Turning, turning, turning ♫</i>

23:38.680 --> 23:42.036
<i>♫ Through all I sit here
and I wait ♫</i>

23:42.120 --> 23:44.076
<i>♫ I turn to stone,
I turn to stone... ♫</i>

23:44.160 --> 23:45.718
<i>Good morning.</i>

23:45.800 --> 23:48.678
- Do we have good Wi-Fi?
- Nope.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.592
All right.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.358
Hello.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.630
Maha,
what's happening?

24:04.720 --> 24:06.278
Excuse me?

24:06.360 --> 24:10.114
- Is Mr. Karim Al-Ahmad in?
- I'm afraid he's not.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.670
- He is in Riyadh today.
- You assured me he would be in all day.

24:13.760 --> 24:18.311
I know, but his plans changed last night.
I'm so sorry.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.630
Let me ask
you something, Maha.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.951
Are you sure there
isn't someone I can talk to

24:24.040 --> 24:25.758
about our presentation
to the king?

24:25.840 --> 24:29.515
I'm afraid not. Mr. Al-Ahmad
really is your primary contact.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.795
He'll be back tomorrow.
He guaranteed it.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.950
<i>Excuse me.</i>

24:38.280 --> 24:39.838
I'm sorry.

25:15.560 --> 25:16.879
You look new.

25:16.960 --> 25:20.077
Oh, hi. I'm supposed
to meet somebody.

25:20.160 --> 25:23.994
- Are you Alan Clay?
- I am indeed.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.469
Hello, my name is Hanne.
I work for Karim.

25:26.560 --> 25:27.788
He's not going
to be in today,

25:27.920 --> 25:29.399
so he told me
to look out for you.

25:29.480 --> 25:32.950
Well, it's nice to meet you, Hanne.
Where are you from?

25:33.040 --> 25:35.998
I was just about to have a smoke.
Join me?

25:38.520 --> 25:42.308
- Water?
- Please.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.550
- Wow.
- I know.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.791
We live
like teenagers here.

25:52.880 --> 25:56.759
Hiding our vices
from that...

25:56.840 --> 25:58.398
shadowy army of parents.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.677
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

26:04.120 --> 26:07.032
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.429
- Sure?
- Yes. Thank you.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.636
Aw, that's...

26:13.080 --> 26:16.072
I'm having a squabble with
the chairs in this kingdom.

26:18.280 --> 26:21.113
- Sit with me.
- Yeah.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.277
This is better.

26:27.360 --> 26:32.150
- So you're from Relyand?
- Recently, yeah, yeah.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.549
We hope to supply
the city with its IT.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.073
But I'm trying
to get an idea

26:36.160 --> 26:39.470
of the timeline of when
the king will come in.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.398
I hope they didn't
make any promise to you.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.710
Well, no. No, not really,
but I was led to believe

26:45.800 --> 26:47.791
our process would
be fast-tracked.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.678
Wow, that would
be good for all of us.

26:50.760 --> 26:53.433
The king hasn't
been here in a while.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.919
How long is a while?

26:55.000 --> 26:58.788
Well, I've been here 18 months
and he hasn't been here yet.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.271
How's the jet lag?
Have you adjusted?

27:06.360 --> 27:07.952
Actually, I feel
like a pane of glass

27:08.040 --> 27:09.632
that needs
to be shattered.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.870
Oh.
Have you got pills?

27:11.960 --> 27:16.875
No. No! I figured I'd be
executed at customs.

27:18.640 --> 27:21.473
I have something
for you.

27:21.560 --> 27:25.348
- Do you have good Wi-Fi here?
- Uh, sometimes, yeah.

27:25.440 --> 27:29.558
But, you know,
Wi-Fi is the least of our problems.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.993
There you go.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.993
- Olive oil?
- That's what you tell anyone who asks.

27:36.080 --> 27:38.992
Have a little taste when
you get back to the hotel.

27:39.080 --> 27:42.038
I'm pretty sure it will
shatter your glass.

27:48.360 --> 27:51.272
<i>Okay, team!
Here's what I got.</i>

27:51.360 --> 27:53.715
One... no update yet
on the food.

27:53.800 --> 27:58.157
<i>Two... and I quote,
"Wi-Fi is the least of our problems."</i>

27:58.280 --> 28:00.999
And three... the king is coming,
just nobody knows when.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.355
That's all
Mr. Al-Ahmad told you?

28:03.440 --> 28:06.477
I didn't meet with him.
I will tomorrow, hopefully.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.990
So, should we
set up today?

28:10.080 --> 28:12.469
Yes. Unpack the rest
of the gear.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.755
Check that
we're ready for showtime.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.872
I think we should
expect the unexpected.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.829
<i>- This is Alan.
- I've got Eric Randall for you.</i>

28:25.920 --> 28:28.275
<i>So, did you meet the guy?
Karim Whatshisname?</i>

28:28.360 --> 28:32.239
<i>No, but I met his associate.
Very nice woman from Denmark.</i>

28:32.320 --> 28:34.276
<i>From Denmark? And?</i>

28:34.360 --> 28:36.590
<i>Really encouraging.
We should be ready to roll</i>

28:36.680 --> 28:37.999
<i>by tomorrow afternoon, I think.</i>

28:38.080 --> 28:40.816
- Welcome to the Hyatt Jeddah.
<i>- You mean the king is coming tomorrow?</i>

28:40.840 --> 28:42.319
- Bye, Alan.
<i>- Probably not tomorrow,</i>

28:42.400 --> 28:45.278
<i>but she said Mr. Al-Ahmad
will confirm specifics very soon.</i>

28:45.360 --> 28:47.396
<i>What is that
supposed to mean?</i>

28:47.480 --> 28:50.438
<i>Alan, half the board is calling
me just about every 20 minutes.</i>

28:50.520 --> 28:52.040
<i>Steve Milligan on the line.</i>

28:52.080 --> 28:54.913
<i>Jesus, you have to give me
something more exciting.</i>

28:55.000 --> 28:57.560
Okay.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.593
<i>Dear Kit,</i>

29:25.680 --> 29:29.355
<i>you say that your mother
has always been emotionally unreliable.</i>

29:29.440 --> 29:33.319
<i>That's true
to a certain extent.</i>

29:33.400 --> 29:36.631
<i>But who among us is completely
stable all the time?</i>

29:42.000 --> 29:43.228
<i>Dear Kit,</i>

29:43.320 --> 29:45.959
<i>from this godforsaken hotel room</i>

29:46.040 --> 29:47.951
<i>5,000 miles away,</i>

29:48.040 --> 29:51.237
<i>I offer you this confession</i>

29:51.320 --> 29:54.790
<i>and ask you
for your forgiveness.</i>

29:55.360 --> 29:57.954
<i>I've made your short life</i>

29:58.040 --> 30:00.031
<i>one of burden and worry</i>

30:00.120 --> 30:03.749
<i>when you should have
been living carefree.</i>

30:03.840 --> 30:06.513
<i>My penance for blowing it</i>

30:06.600 --> 30:11.515
<i>is my being here, a salesman,
back going door-to-door,</i>

30:11.600 --> 30:17.516
<i>with my own burden being
this mini hump on my back,</i>

30:17.600 --> 30:20.717
<i>which is either a disease
about to eat my spine...</i>

30:20.800 --> 30:24.110
<i>- Dad!
- ...or a sack of spiders growing under my skin.</i>

30:24.200 --> 30:27.397
<i>- Dad!
- Your mother would be pleased either way.</i>

30:27.480 --> 30:29.675
Stop this, please.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.678
Stop smoking, Kitty.

30:35.800 --> 30:40.191
<i>So, forgive me for not being
the father you deserve,</i>

30:40.280 --> 30:44.034
<i>for not providing you with the
means to follow your dreams.</i>

30:44.120 --> 30:49.638
<i>All I can do now,
and for who knows how long,</i>

30:49.720 --> 30:52.757
<i>is hope an opening comes along</i>

30:52.840 --> 30:57.470
<i>that I can somehow squeeze through...</i>

30:58.320 --> 31:00.993
<i>and make things right.</i>

31:15.880 --> 31:17.871
Oh...

31:26.360 --> 31:28.874
Ah!

31:28.960 --> 31:30.871
Ah.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.796
- Are you available?
<i>- Alan, you sound terrible.</i>

31:46.880 --> 31:48.154
<i>Were you run over
by a camel?</i>

31:48.240 --> 31:50.549
- Can you take me to KMET?
<i>- Of course.</i>

31:50.640 --> 31:52.392
<i>Are you missing
your shuttles on purpose</i>

31:52.480 --> 31:54.675
<i>to spend more time with Yousef,
your guide and hero?</i>

31:54.760 --> 31:57.672
You are using
too many words.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.798
Hey, do you like reggae?

32:10.680 --> 32:14.036
So, where'd you get
the booze, huh?

32:14.160 --> 32:17.470
- Excuse me?
- I know a hangover when I see one.

32:17.560 --> 32:21.109
- Where did you get it?
- I would rather not say.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.714
What, you think you might
endanger your source?

32:23.800 --> 32:26.598
- Oh, you think that's funny?
- I do, yeah.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.433
But, listen, you don't
need to go to KMET today.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.112
There's no way
the king is coming.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.633
He's in Yemen.

32:43.760 --> 32:46.752
- Yousef, what are you doing?
- Taking care of you.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.514
- Right here?
- Yeah, it's not too far.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.510
Where are we going?

32:56.600 --> 33:01.116
- Well, you said you wanted to try real Arabic food.
- I didn't say that.

33:01.200 --> 33:04.829
You'll do great.
It's the best hangover cure in town.

33:04.960 --> 33:05.960
Come on.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.677
- That was her.
- Who?

33:18.760 --> 33:20.910
The woman I shouldn't
be talking to.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.714
Jameelah's her name.
A gorgeous girl.

33:25.800 --> 33:28.234
Very beautiful,
you know?

33:29.200 --> 33:32.033
But, unfortunately,
not very smart.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.634
Sweet, but dumb
as a goat.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.711
Anyway, she's married
to this older guy.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.313
This older man
is very rich.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.868
- But also a bit strange.
- Strange?

33:40.960 --> 33:44.236
- I think he's some kind of international swinger.
- What does that mean?

33:44.320 --> 33:48.393
- I think he goes to Europe and has sex with boys.
- So he's gay?

33:48.480 --> 33:52.917
Gay? No.
You think that means he's gay?

33:54.920 --> 33:58.799
Anyway, a few weeks ago,
she starts sending me these texts.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.348
At first they were just bored,
like, "What are you doing?"

34:01.440 --> 34:05.194
Blah, blah.
But recently they've gotten really sexy.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.511
If he'd seen any of those messages,
I'd be dead.

34:08.600 --> 34:09.918
She'd definitely be dead.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.710
So she's jeopardizing
her life for these texts?

34:31.199 --> 34:34.510
- Her again.
- Why do you talk to her like that?

34:34.600 --> 34:36.955
- What do you mean?
- That lovey-dovey way.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.635
It's like she is your girlfriend.

34:42.719 --> 34:44.597
She's a sweetie,
you know?

34:47.199 --> 34:50.078
- You need to sit down with him.
- What? No.

34:50.159 --> 34:53.469
- No, no, no.
- You need to sit down with him,

34:53.560 --> 34:54.913
and you gotta
look him in the eye

34:55.000 --> 34:57.416
and you have to tell him you haven't
done anything with his wife.

34:57.440 --> 35:00.318
- Because you haven't, right?
- No, nothing. Never.

35:00.400 --> 35:03.631
You tell him this. This is how he
knows you're telling the truth.

35:03.720 --> 35:06.496
You look him in the eye. Because if
you actually were screwing his wife,

35:06.520 --> 35:08.192
- you'd never face him.
- Mm-mm.

35:08.280 --> 35:12.398
Trust me.
This is how you handle this.

35:16.880 --> 35:20.998
Alan, your back.
What is that?

35:21.080 --> 35:24.595
I removed a scab.
Is it bad?

35:24.880 --> 35:26.950
You want
to see a doctor?

35:27.040 --> 35:29.270
<i>Alan, where are you?
Why are you not out there?</i>

35:29.360 --> 35:32.272
- Because nothing is happening today.
<i>- Why not?</i>

35:32.400 --> 35:34.550
- The king is in Yemen.
<i>- Shit.</i>

35:34.640 --> 35:36.790
<i>- And where are you?</i>
- At the doctor's.

35:36.880 --> 35:40.077
<i>- Are you sick?</i>
- No, it's nothing. Don't worry.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.430
- I'll be fine. Don't worry.
<i>- Okay, all right.</i>

35:42.520 --> 35:44.376
<i>- But don't forget...</i>
- I think I have to go now.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.197
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Bye, Eric.

35:46.280 --> 35:47.872
- Mr. Clay?
- Yes.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.394
I'm Dr. Hakem.
Come inside.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.433
Did you do
something to it?

35:55.520 --> 35:58.956
- I did a bit of investigating.
- With what?

35:59.040 --> 36:03.033
- A steak knife.
- Was this an attempt on your life?

36:03.120 --> 36:05.190
No.

36:05.280 --> 36:09.512
- Are you on medication? Prozac?
- I'm not depressed.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.079
I was curious.

36:11.160 --> 36:15.756
- I was just trying to see...
- You have a minor infection.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.829
Well, what is it,
that thing?

36:19.920 --> 36:22.957
I suspect
it's just a lipoma.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.632
And that's not bad?

36:24.720 --> 36:29.111
Well, if it's a lipoma,
then it's just a growth, like a cyst.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.156
- So it's...
- Benign.

36:31.240 --> 36:34.152
- Are you sure?
<i>- No, to be sure, we'd need to do</i>

36:34.240 --> 36:35.992
a little bit more
investigating.

36:36.080 --> 36:38.310
It's just that it's
so close to the spine

36:38.400 --> 36:41.358
and I haven't
been well recently.

36:41.440 --> 36:41.997
Not well?

36:42.080 --> 36:46.551
Clumsy, slow,
lacking energy.

36:46.680 --> 36:50.355
- Can you specify?
- I don't know...

36:52.160 --> 36:54.355
I've lost direction,
I think.

36:54.960 --> 36:59.476
<i>And strength
and certain abilities.</i>

36:59.560 --> 37:03.109
- For instance?
<i>- I've always been pretty good at...</i>

37:04.720 --> 37:08.110
...creating simplicity.

37:10.240 --> 37:15.360
Making complicated things and
situations go smoother, easier.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.555
So your feeling is that
this bump is the cause

37:18.640 --> 37:20.358
of the loss of those
capabilities?

37:20.440 --> 37:23.512
- And that's unlikely, is it?
- I would say it's unlikely.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.750
We should do a
biopsy to make sure.

37:25.840 --> 37:30.197
- A biopsy?
- Yes, and then we send it to the lab.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.557
Great.

37:37.600 --> 37:40.717
This has you
really worried, huh?

37:40.800 --> 37:43.360
Oh, I'm worried
about a lot of things.

37:47.720 --> 37:50.314
Okay, you can
change now.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.756
I had the same thing
a few years ago,

37:58.880 --> 38:00.916
like a tightening
in my chest.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.515
<i>When I got the EKG,
I was so sure I'd find out I had a murmur</i>

38:04.600 --> 38:07.558
<i>or an irregular rhythm or something
that would explain the fatigue.</i>

38:07.680 --> 38:10.513
<i>And?</i>

38:10.640 --> 38:14.394
And it was nothing.

38:14.520 --> 38:18.752
- That's too bad.
- We're stuck with our stupid good health.

38:20.600 --> 38:21.999
So, come back
on Sunday

38:22.080 --> 38:24.878
- and we'll take look at the results, okay?
- Sunday?

38:24.960 --> 38:28.430
- Our weekends are Friday and Saturday.
- Oh, right. Right, right.

38:28.520 --> 38:31.990
- Will you be here on Sunday?
- Yes.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.795
- I'll see you then, Mr. Clay.
- Thank you.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.271
<i>A woman doctor, huh?</i>

38:39.360 --> 38:41.555
- Where was she from?
- I don't know.

38:41.640 --> 38:45.633
- But she was Saudi?
- Yeah, I think so, why?

38:45.760 --> 38:47.591
We don't have
many women doctors,

38:47.720 --> 38:52.396
so odds are against you running
into one at first opportunity.

38:52.480 --> 38:55.597
- Was she veiled?
- Yeah, a hijab.

38:55.680 --> 38:58.513
And you saw
her alone?

38:58.600 --> 39:02.639
Interesting, interesting.

39:04.520 --> 39:07.239
Hey, so what time
tomorrow?

39:07.320 --> 39:08.878
Shut up.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.393
Welcome
to the Hyatt Jeddah.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.349
- This is Alan.
- Hey, it's Hanne.

39:25.440 --> 39:28.238
- Good, how are you?
<i>- I didn't ask you how you are.</i>

39:28.320 --> 39:30.470
- I guess I felt you should know.
<i>- Okay.</i>

39:30.560 --> 39:33.199
<i>- Are you already in bed?</i>
- No, why?

39:33.280 --> 39:37.512
<i>- There's a party at the embassy tonight.</i>
- At the Danish embassy?

39:39.560 --> 39:41.198
<i>Name, please.</i>

39:41.280 --> 39:43.635
Soøren Kierkegaard.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.790
<i>City?</i>

39:45.880 --> 39:47.996
Copenhagen.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.711
Vodka.

40:33.720 --> 40:37.395
I'm looking
for Hanne.

40:45.160 --> 40:47.071
Excuse me.

40:55.560 --> 40:58.632
Hey, where
were you?

40:59.320 --> 41:02.039
I don't know.
Where am I?

41:23.360 --> 41:24.952
Let's make a mistake.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.912
<i>♫...higher, higher ♫</i>

41:29.000 --> 41:32.037
<i>♫ Burning my desire ♫</i>

41:32.840 --> 41:35.400
<i>♫ Baby, take me home
with you tonight... ♫</i>

41:39.440 --> 41:40.668
Oh.

41:40.760 --> 41:41.954
Okay.

41:42.040 --> 41:45.476
You seem to have a plan.
I admire that.

42:04.440 --> 42:08.319
- This is how much I excite you?
- I'm sorry. You're gorgeous.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.753
But I can't help
but be distracted

42:09.880 --> 42:11.296
by the fact that
I'm a little drunk...

42:11.320 --> 42:13.276
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and I'm on the floor

42:13.360 --> 42:15.635
of the Danish
ambassador's cloakroom

42:15.760 --> 42:19.230
with a beautiful woman
I don't really know.

42:19.320 --> 42:20.753
Mm. Ooh.

42:20.840 --> 42:23.877
Would you take offense
if I tried something else?

42:23.960 --> 42:26.997
I wouldn't
take offense, but I...

42:27.080 --> 42:29.594
prefer if you didn't.

42:35.080 --> 42:38.470
- So this is frustrating.
- Yeah.

42:39.680 --> 42:41.636
What do you think we should
we do instead, then?

42:46.480 --> 42:48.675
Would you like to hear
a really good joke?

42:58.880 --> 43:03.431
- Hey, you like Elvis Presley?
- No! No!

43:03.520 --> 43:04.873
What? Yes.

43:04.960 --> 43:07.918
- Yes?
- Yes, just not now.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.549
You know, your sleeping schedule
is beginning to worry me.

43:12.640 --> 43:16.076
I had a really
weird night last night.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.958
- Yeah? What...
- I can't talk about it.

43:19.040 --> 43:21.031
- Why not?
- Because I promised not to.

43:21.160 --> 43:25.358
Oh. Okay,
of course. Yeah.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.399
Oof.

43:39.760 --> 43:41.273
What has happened?

43:41.360 --> 43:44.272
<i>Hey, are you all right?</i>

43:44.360 --> 43:45.236
Yeah.

43:45.320 --> 43:46.912
What happened
to the A/C?

43:47.000 --> 43:50.151
It just
stopped working.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.754
We've been asleep
about an hour, sorry.

43:52.840 --> 43:56.310
Any chance of the king
showing up today?

43:56.400 --> 43:57.992
No, he's
in Riyadh today.

44:00.480 --> 44:03.677
All right, you know what?
I've had enough.

44:03.760 --> 44:06.957
I'm gonna go up there
and come back with some answers

44:07.080 --> 44:10.356
about the A/C
and the food and the Wi-Fi.

44:10.440 --> 44:13.432
And at least some
semblance of a timeline.

44:13.520 --> 44:16.353
Wow, Alan, where's all
this bluster coming from?

44:16.440 --> 44:17.919
I don't know, Rachel.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.310
But I promise to utilize it
to everyone's advantage.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.715
Good morning.

44:30.120 --> 44:31.678
Hello.

44:31.760 --> 44:34.797
Hello, Maha. How are you?
Is Karim Al-Ahmad in today?

44:34.880 --> 44:36.108
I'm afraid he's not.

44:36.200 --> 44:38.156
And will he be in today?

44:38.240 --> 44:41.277
- I don't think so, he's in New York.
- New York?

44:43.440 --> 44:45.874
- What about Hanne?
- Hanne?

44:45.960 --> 44:47.951
Danish girl,
works in payroll.

44:48.080 --> 44:51.470
- I...
- I'll be all right. Thank you, Maha.

45:01.280 --> 45:02.872
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

45:02.960 --> 45:05.110
I'm looking for Hanne,
the Danish consultant.

45:06.680 --> 45:10.195
I'm afraid she's in Riyadh today.
Can I help?

45:10.280 --> 45:12.669
Alan Clay.
I'm with the Relyand Group.

45:12.760 --> 45:14.637
Karim Al-Ahmad.

45:15.680 --> 45:19.150
Karim...
Karim Al-Ahmad?

45:19.240 --> 45:22.038
- You're not in New York?
- No, I'm not.

45:22.120 --> 45:24.350
My apologies, Mr. Clay,
but I have to leave

45:24.440 --> 45:26.556
for a meeting
and I'm already late.

45:30.280 --> 45:34.114
Why don't you join me and we can
discuss a few things along the way?

45:34.200 --> 45:35.519
Where to?

45:35.600 --> 45:38.512
To that area of construction.
Where the condos are being built.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.079
I'm meeting one
of the architects.

45:42.120 --> 45:46.318
- Your receptionist said you were out today.
- I'm sorry, she's new.

45:46.400 --> 45:50.075
- Were you here the last two days?
- No.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.957
Nice.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.474
- Would you like to drive?
- Oh, no.

45:54.560 --> 45:57.313
Ah, please.
Be my guest.

46:00.640 --> 46:02.153
<i>I assure you, no other vendor</i>

46:02.280 --> 46:04.096
<i>is more important to us
than the Relyand Group.</i>

46:04.120 --> 46:08.432
Well, that's very good to hear.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.750
- But there are issues.
- Tell me.

46:10.840 --> 46:13.115
We cannot set up
our presentation out there.

46:13.200 --> 46:14.680
- Why not?
- Because we are in a tent.

46:14.720 --> 46:17.359
I'm sorry, but that's the designated
presentation area.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.351
- We need a hard line.
- I cannot do that.

46:19.440 --> 46:21.078
We need very good
Wi-Fi at least.

46:21.160 --> 46:23.276
I will have it fixed.
What else?

46:23.360 --> 46:25.112
The air conditioning
doesn't work.

46:25.200 --> 46:28.590
- My team is suffering.
- It will be addressed immediately. What else?

46:28.720 --> 46:31.439
How do we eat?
We've been bringing food from the hotel.

46:31.520 --> 46:34.671
After the weekend,
you will have catered meals every day.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.159
Anything else?

46:37.320 --> 46:39.515
How long will we be
waiting for the king?

46:39.600 --> 46:40.874
Turn left here.

46:42.680 --> 46:45.717
<i>- Is it days? Weeks?
- I do not know. I don't know.</i>

46:45.800 --> 46:47.836
<i>- Months?
- I hope not.</i>

46:58.680 --> 47:00.193
Wow.

47:00.280 --> 47:04.637
I can see you must be driving
a sports car yourself in the US.

47:04.720 --> 47:06.278
No, no, no.

47:06.360 --> 47:08.476
<i>It's an executive
privilege thing.</i>

47:08.560 --> 47:11.632
<i>We used to have
private races down in Texas.</i>

47:11.720 --> 47:13.950
When you were
with Schwinn?

47:16.120 --> 47:18.031
Yes.

47:19.080 --> 47:21.310
I owned a Schwinn
bike as a kid.

47:21.440 --> 47:22.668
- You did?
- Yeah.

47:22.760 --> 47:26.070
I lived in New Jersey
for about five years.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.480
And then later
in business school,

47:27.560 --> 47:28.776
Schwinn was one
of our case studies.

47:28.800 --> 47:31.189
Mm.

47:35.360 --> 47:38.033
Interesting period.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.479
This way.

47:40.560 --> 47:41.616
Schwinns were made
in the US,

47:41.640 --> 47:45.235
the Raleighs in England,
the Italian bikes, French...

47:45.320 --> 47:48.198
For a time, you had real
international competition.

47:48.280 --> 47:50.316
You were choosing between
very different products

47:50.400 --> 47:53.676
with different heritages,
sensibilities, techniques.

47:53.760 --> 47:57.799
- Well, that's gone now.
- What happened, in your view?

47:57.880 --> 48:00.952
- I thought you studied our case.
- I did.

48:01.040 --> 48:04.032
- Schwinn went to China.
- We did.

48:04.120 --> 48:06.918
They could build our bikes a
lot cheaper and a lot faster

48:07.000 --> 48:10.037
- and it seemed like a good idea at the time.
- But it wasn't?

48:10.120 --> 48:11.599
Well, obviously not.

48:11.680 --> 48:14.478
We taught them how to build
a good, solid bicycle.

48:14.560 --> 48:17.552
They took that wisdom and started
making all the bikes themselves.

48:17.640 --> 48:21.519
- Now they own the market.
- Because they can sell them for nothing.

48:21.600 --> 48:23.336
But it's just a matter
of taking different stickers

48:23.360 --> 48:24.920
and putting them
on the very same bikes.

48:24.960 --> 48:27.349
It was built in the same factory
somewhere in Asia,

48:27.440 --> 48:31.479
all the brands there are,
and now Schwinn is just one of them.

48:33.240 --> 48:35.959
Do you ever feel you might
have done it differently?

48:38.480 --> 48:40.994
- Me personally?
- You were on the board of Schwinn

48:41.080 --> 48:42.433
when all that
happened, no?

48:42.520 --> 48:45.796
Do you think there might have been
a way for the company to survive?

48:45.880 --> 48:48.872
In America,
I mean.

48:59.760 --> 49:02.115
It was complicated.

49:02.200 --> 49:03.553
Hmm.

49:03.640 --> 49:06.916
<i>Do you know that some
of our people are already living here?</i>

49:07.000 --> 49:10.197
- Really?
- Yeah. You should take a look at one of the units.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.474
Me? Why?

49:11.560 --> 49:14.438
You'll be spending some time
implementing the IT plan, no?

49:14.520 --> 49:16.954
Well, yeah.
If we get the job, yeah.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.600
Excuse me.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.077
Huh.

49:25.160 --> 49:26.752
This is going
to take a few minutes.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.308
Go ahead,
it's on the fifth floor.

49:29.400 --> 49:31.391
The elevators
don't work just yet.

49:31.480 --> 49:33.994
Take the stairs.
It's not a long way up.

49:34.080 --> 49:37.436
Ring the doorbell at 501. There's a
man, Hassan, he'll show you everything.

49:37.520 --> 49:39.397
I'll be with you shortly.

51:09.560 --> 51:13.189
- Mr. Clay, I presume.
- Hassan?

51:13.280 --> 51:15.669
Very good to meet you.
Come in.

51:17.600 --> 51:21.752
Karim Al-Ahmad called me.
He apologizes, he had to leave.

51:21.840 --> 51:23.193
He ditched me?

51:24.280 --> 51:27.511
I don't know.
I was told to give you a ride.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.198
Tea?

51:30.280 --> 51:33.431
Or something
more compelling?

51:35.320 --> 51:37.072
Would you have
a cold beer?

51:38.320 --> 51:39.992
Of course.

51:41.320 --> 51:44.232
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

51:46.200 --> 51:47.872
So, you actually
live here?

51:49.560 --> 51:54.714
No, this is the sales room.
I have a separate space upstairs.

51:54.840 --> 51:59.391
Ah.
So, how's business?

51:59.480 --> 52:02.392
Honestly, quite trying.

52:02.480 --> 52:05.950
- Oh, that's too bad.
- We're not getting any firm commitments from anyone.

52:06.040 --> 52:09.316
What about those restaurants you're
promoting downstairs? When do they open?

52:10.600 --> 52:11.510
That's a bluff.

52:11.600 --> 52:14.433
<i>We haven't sold any spot
to these companies.</i>

52:31.080 --> 52:32.957
<i>Welcome to the Hyatt Jeddah.</i>

53:12.040 --> 53:14.190
<i>Salaam alaikum?</i>

53:14.280 --> 53:15.030
Yousef...

53:15.120 --> 53:18.999
- I think I'm having a stroke or something.
<i>- Alan?</i>

53:42.320 --> 53:45.756
Mr. Clay, don't sleep.
Look at me.

53:45.840 --> 53:48.912
Have you been drinking?
Speak to me.

53:57.200 --> 53:58.599
You'll be okay.

54:14.040 --> 54:16.918
As I said, you're stuck
with your stupid good health.

54:17.360 --> 54:20.636
Are you kidding?

54:20.720 --> 54:21.720
What happened
to me?

54:21.800 --> 54:24.075
I couldn't breathe.
It was scary.

54:24.160 --> 54:27.596
I think it was the scare
that triggered the whole thing.

54:28.200 --> 54:29.200
How do you mean?

54:29.280 --> 54:31.032
Those symptoms
are usually indicators

54:31.160 --> 54:33.435
of what we call
an anxiety attack,

54:33.520 --> 54:36.034
<i>which often leads
to a physical breakdown,</i>

54:36.120 --> 54:40.432
and what with your jet lag
and I'm sure this didn't help.

54:42.440 --> 54:46.194
- Am I going to jail?
- No, nobody saw it. I think.

54:46.280 --> 54:48.271
- You did.
- Yes.

54:48.360 --> 54:52.672
Aren't you obliged to report I'm in
possession of illicit beverages?

54:52.760 --> 54:55.991
No, but I don't think
you should drink this stuff.

54:56.080 --> 54:58.878
It's bad for you.
We have better booze in Jeddah.

55:02.600 --> 55:05.512
- I have a question.
- Yes?

55:06.840 --> 55:09.832
- What are you doing here?
- You called me.

55:09.920 --> 55:12.150
- I did?
- Yes, I was on a late shift.

55:12.240 --> 55:14.071
I had just finished
an operation.

55:17.680 --> 55:19.830
Thank you.

55:19.960 --> 55:22.758
<i>Alan! Alan.</i>

55:22.880 --> 55:24.791
Yousef.

55:25.880 --> 55:27.871
<i>- Salaam alaikum.
- Alaikum salaam.</i>

55:27.960 --> 55:31.191
- Oh, God, I called you, too.
- You worried me.

55:31.720 --> 55:35.156
I'm sorry. Yousef,
this is Dr. Hakem.

55:41.520 --> 55:43.636
- Oh, thank God.
- You get some rest.

55:43.720 --> 55:47.713
- Try to relax over the weekend.
- Thank you, I will.

55:54.720 --> 55:57.712
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

55:57.800 --> 56:01.349
What's this Saudi woman doing here
with you in the middle of the night?

56:01.440 --> 56:02.555
Well, she's my doctor.

56:02.640 --> 56:03.720
You know,
that's absurd, no?

56:03.760 --> 56:05.318
You and
the Saudi woman doctor.

56:05.400 --> 56:07.480
- What are you talking about?
- She might be married.

56:07.520 --> 56:08.919
- For sure she has kids.
- Yousef!

56:09.000 --> 56:10.376
There's a lot at stake
for a woman like her.

56:10.400 --> 56:13.472
Yousef, stop it.
What is wrong with you?

56:13.560 --> 56:15.710
I'm not having
an affair with my doctor.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.594
I'm sorry, Alan.

56:28.680 --> 56:30.830
- I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

56:31.840 --> 56:34.274
I heard some noises
outside my house.

56:34.360 --> 56:40.037
I got out of bed. I saw three
men standing at the window.

56:40.120 --> 56:42.918
<i>I nearly crapped my pants.</i>

56:44.520 --> 56:49.799
- The husband?
- And his henchmen, yes.

56:49.880 --> 56:54.158
They just stood there.
That was it.

56:54.240 --> 56:57.630
- I have to leave town.
- Leave? Where to?

56:57.720 --> 57:01.235
To my father's place in the mountains.
They won't go there.

57:01.320 --> 57:04.039
That's my home village.
Everyone there will look out for me.

57:04.120 --> 57:06.111
We have guns
and all that.

57:08.920 --> 57:10.956
I'm sorry about
what I said before.

57:13.040 --> 57:15.952
How long
is the drive?

57:23.000 --> 57:26.879
- You like Rashed Al-Majed?
- Not bad.

57:26.960 --> 57:29.315
It's my nephew, Salem.
He is coming, too.

57:38.880 --> 57:41.633
- This is my nephew, Salem.
- Hey. <i>Salaam.</i>

57:43.920 --> 57:47.435
- He's the grandson of my father's second wife.
- Ah.

57:47.520 --> 57:50.751
- What are you?
- I'm the third son of his third.

57:50.840 --> 57:52.956
My father
has four wives.

57:53.040 --> 57:55.349
Welcome to the KSA.

57:55.440 --> 57:57.271
Ah, I forgot about that.

58:08.440 --> 58:11.318
Oh, sorry.
You know who.

58:11.400 --> 58:14.551
What does that mean,
"Exit non-Muslims"?

58:14.640 --> 58:15.072
Huh?

58:15.160 --> 58:18.470
Yousef?

58:18.560 --> 58:19.959
- What?
- Oh, shit.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.514
- What's going on?
- I missed the exit back there.

58:32.120 --> 58:35.317
Stop it.
Hey, stop it!

58:35.400 --> 58:36.674
What's happening?

58:36.760 --> 58:38.080
You're not allowed
to enter Mecca.

58:38.200 --> 58:39.736
It's holy ground.
It's for Muslims only.

58:39.760 --> 58:41.512
- What?
- I forgot, you know?

58:41.600 --> 58:42.960
It's routine.
I always go this way.

58:50.640 --> 58:52.631
Hey, want to get smuggled
through the holy city?

58:55.040 --> 58:58.794
We can put you
in a thobe, you'll pass.

59:06.480 --> 59:10.109
If we get stopped, just quote your
favorite verse from the Koran.

59:28.960 --> 59:32.350
- So that's the famous mosque?
- Al-Haram, yes.

59:32.440 --> 59:34.715
Al-Haram.
Wow.

59:37.760 --> 59:39.512
Actually, would you mind
not looking at it?

59:39.600 --> 59:42.797
Oh, sure, yeah.

59:42.880 --> 59:45.189
Yeah, sorry.

59:47.680 --> 59:48.874
Yeah, I'm sorry.

59:56.320 --> 59:58.231
Ah, shit.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.959
What does it mean
when you do that?

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.077
- Point up like that?
- That means "God will provide."

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.357
- And that works?
- It ends the discussion.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.352
Cops.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.674
<i>- Salaam alaikum.</i>
- Alan.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.510
Alan.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.837
- Hello.
- Want to come?

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:15.118
No, I'll take
a look around, okay?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.389
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.189
- You need a ride?
- No, no, thank you.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.508
I'm just out
for a walk.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.873
Taking some pictures?

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:01.748
Yeah, it's
a beautiful place.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.354
I was watching you
from above.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.879
- You take a lot of pictures.
- Yeah, I guess.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.032
- American?
- Yeah.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:15.829
All these pictures.
You work for CIA or something?

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.679
Just a little
freelance work.

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.398
Nothing full-time.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.473
- Alan!
<i>- Sorry.</i>

01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.629
Sorry.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.315
- We thought you'd been kidnapped.
- No. I was...

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.550
It was so beautiful,
I kept exploring.

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.596
What's with these rifles?

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.598
Ah, what I wanted
to show you, actually.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.071
This one belonged
to my grandfather.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:19.119
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Yeah.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.519
Hmm.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.520
See, I thought you'd know
something about rifles.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.910
I used to be a decent
marksman in my time.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.116
Tonight, you want to hunt
some wolves with us?

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.912
- Wolves?
- Yeah.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.149
Where? Here?

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.336
Yeah, apparently there's
some wolves killing sheep lately

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.496
and they're organizing
a hunt.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.192
Looking for anyone
who can shoot.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.916
Did you tell this guy
you're with the CIA?

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.828
Oh, he asked me
if I worked for the CIA.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.629
I said I just did some part-time
freelance work for them.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.676
Why would you
say this?

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.797
Well, it was a joke.
I was joking.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.476
- He asked me... it was a ludicrous question.
- It's not ludicrous to him.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.394
Now I have to convince him you're
not with the CIA. How do I do this?

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.272
Well, if I was from the CIA, I wouldn't
tell the first person who asked me.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.273
- Shake his hand.
- What?

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.918
Shake his hand.
Shake his hand.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.397
- You shouldn't have said that.
- I know.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.916
- People don't like jokes like that.
- I knew as soon as I said it.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.788
It's like joking you have a bomb
when you're in airport security.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.519
That's the analogy
I had in mind, yeah.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.872
Let's go hunting, huh?

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.710
That's where the sheep
was taken last.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:52.039
- Were you ever in the army?
- No.

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.838
My dad was.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.718
- Where?
- He volunteered in Korea.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.435
- But you didn't want to join the army?
- Me? No.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.835
- Why not? No good wars?
- Exactly.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.229
But you would
have fought in WW2?

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.471
I would have gone, would've
tried to avoid the Pacific.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.472
- And if you were young now?
- Yousef, why all these questions?

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.552
Are you thinking
of joining the army?

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.631
- Maybe.
- No, don't. Don't.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.136
- Why not?
- No, you should go to college

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.515
and finish and give
yourself some options.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.513
- There are no options here, Alan. You know that.
- Well, then leave.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.229
I prefer to stay here
and have things be different.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.676
<i>It's nothing. It's just the sheep.</i>

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.588
Hey, Alan.
Would you fight for us?

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.559
Fight for you how?

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.278
No one's going to invade
Saudi Arabia.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.636
No, I know. I'm curious.
Just about individuals.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.551
Probably. I think
we have a lot of people

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.870
willing to fight to support
people who want to be free.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.791
And Americans
love a cause.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.998
So if I start a democratic revolution here,
you would support me?

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.999
- Oh, is this your plan?
- No, I'm just asking. Would you?

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.310
- Of course.
- How?

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.551
- Well, I don't know.
- You would send troops?

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.111
- Me personally?
- No, you know what I mean. The US.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.838
Send troops?
Not a chance.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.911
- Air support?
- Nope. No.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.275
- Shock and awe?
- Here? No way.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.874
What about personally?
Would you personally come to support me?

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.748
- Yeah.
- That was quick.

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:33.559
- Well, I'm sure.
- You're crazy.

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:42.119
I'll be back.

01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:04.679
Welcome
to the Hyatt Jeddah.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.598
You'll... you'll wait
here for me?

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.319
So, you wait, right?

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.473
Mr. Clay?

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.676
- Yes?
- Come in.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.991
<i>Please.</i>

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.117
I'm confused.
Am I not meeting Dr. Hakem?

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.316
Oh, no.
She's not in today.

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:38.910
But I've got these results
here from your biopsy.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.232
- Please, have a seat.
- Yes.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.759
Now, we found some
precancerous cells below.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.674
- Precancerous?
- Yes. You should have it removed.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:58.914
- Have what removed?
- The lipoma, the whole thing, and the sooner the better.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.195
<i>We can do it here.
It's not a big deal.</i>

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.875
- When would that be?
- How about tomorrow?

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.511
Hi.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.949
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.551
I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.753
- Wow.
- Alan.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.832
- What did you do?
- Did you resort to bribery or coercion?

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:47.438
- We've got a great, solid signal.
- The food is amazing.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.954
- We've been trying to reach you.
- I was out of town.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:54.158
- Well, whatever you did, it worked.
- You're the man, Alan.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.310
<i>- So, are we ready?</i>
- One sec.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.072
- Hey, Dave.
- Hey, Brad.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.515
How's it going?

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.318
Sorry.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.032
- Gotcha.
- Me, too. It's a bit low-res, but...

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.989
- Let me adjust this.
- It's getting there.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:25.198
There you are!
Show me your movement ratio.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.150
- That should be your pretty face.
- Yup.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:34.351
- And this is my hideout.
- Got it.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.830
<i>Let's check projection
stability with our favorite object.</i>

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.632
Nice and easy.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.234
So, is it really
happening today?

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.432
A great pleasure,
Your Majesty.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.954
Your Royal Highness,
distinguished members

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.395
of the royal family.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:11.553
For centuries,
business has been done

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.234
in the same manner
as friendships have been made.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:20.350
With culture and language separated
by the mere distance of a handshake.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.318
In Boston,
Massachusetts,

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.995
your friends at Relyand
have developed

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.672
a new technology

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.309
for virtual encountering
on a global scale.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.960
Allow us to give you
a demonstration.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.873
Hey, Alan.
Cheers.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.032
<i>Sticks and stones can
break my bones...</i>

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.669
<i>but holograms
can never hurt me.</i>

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.870
<i>Alan, you're on with Eric.</i>

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.110
<i>Nice work, Alan. Very nice.</i>

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:04.034
<i>Let's keep fingers crossed
they don't choke on our budget.</i>

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.437
- Thrills galore.
- Yeah, and we'll know soon.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:15.355
Well, maybe we should celebrate that.
Do you need a ride?

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.434
I think I should stay
with my team.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.555
Yeah, okay.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.917
Are you
the anesthesia man?

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.437
- Hello, Mr. Clay. How are you today?
- I'm fine, thanks.

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:19.034
Good. This is
Dr. Wei from China

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.160
and his assistant.

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.631
- They'll support me with the procedure.
- Dr. Wei from China.

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:29.555
- Hi.
- Let's do the marks here and antiseptic.

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:53.597
- Hello, Mr. Clay.
- Hello, Dr. Hakem.

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.159
I'm sorry I couldn't
be here on time.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.708
I didn't think
I would see you again.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.633
I'm taking over now.
The anesthetic should already work.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.713
- Is that warm enough?
- Yes. Thank you.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:05.471
Scalpel.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.358
I will talk you through
the entire operation,

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.078
but it might be more
comfortable for you

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:12.390
to think of something
completely different.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.074
A good person.
A nice memory.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.958
Or something
you look forward to.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.270
All right.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.958
I will approach
the affected area now

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.191
with a small cut
adjacent to the lesion.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.397
"He took no notice of the village
children and came enchanted

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.078
thinking
of Christmas Eve."

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.038
- You'll really love it. Just listen to this.
- No, Dad.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.429
- You promised.
- It's a really great joke.

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.589
What?

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:40.399
Now that I've made
the necessary incisions,

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.710
you might feel some tugging
as I extract the cyst.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.555
- You're beautiful.
<i>- What are you doing here?</i>

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:50.509
<i>- I'm worried about a lot of things.
- It'll be okay.</i>

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.079
There it is.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.913
<i>"Dear Dr. Hakem.</i>

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.514
<i>I hope this message
finds you well.</i>

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.034
<i>Your skill made
quick work of that cyst.</i>

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.315
<i>So I want
to thank you again.</i>

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.995
<i>I've been feeling increasingly
energized since the operation</i>

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.832
<i>and I've already
been able to transfer</i>

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:11.390
<i>that energy
to others successfully.</i>

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.751
<i>The only catch is
now I don't have anything</i>

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.717
<i>to blame my problems on.</i>

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:21.316
<i>That little growth explained everything,
and now it's gone.</i>

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:25.791
<i>I am sincerely grateful,
though, I think.</i>

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:28.110
<i>Alan Clay."</i>

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.668
<i>"Dear Mr. Clay,
even though it went</i>

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:33.957
<i>a little harder than I expected,
it was a simple extraction.</i>

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:37.157
<i>Usually the discovery that you're
not dying of a malignant tumor</i>

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.595
<i>leaves most people
with their spirits high.</i>

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.796
<i>But you are not
most people, are you?</i>

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.836
<i>Dr. Zahra Hakem."</i>

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:49.119
<i>"Dear Dr. Hakem, actually,
my spirits are very high indeed,</i>

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.679
<i>maybe too high.</i>

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.991
<i>I'm feeling a little dizzy.
The cause is mysterious.</i>

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.153
<i>But I have felt a strange
new lump in my back.</i>

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:03.109
<i>I'm no doctor, but it feels
like a rubber glove.</i>

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.595
<i>Is there a chance
you left one?</i>

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.830
<i>Sometimes people
leave things like gloves</i>

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.512
<i>with someone they like</i>

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.830
<i>in hopes their retrieval
will provide an excuse</i>

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:15.117
<i>to see that someone again.</i>

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.350
<i>Yours, Alan."</i>

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.950
<i>"Dear Alan, I actually
might have left something.</i>

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:27.034
<i>I'm thinking a sponge? Or maybe part
of a snack I ate during the surgery.</i>

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.315
<i>I think I need
to see you again.</i>

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.118
<i>Perhaps out of the hospital?</i>

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:35.557
<i>We don't want
to worry your insurers.</i>

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.393
<i>Zahra."</i>

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.437
<i>"Dear Zahra,
that's a very good idea.</i>

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:48.399
<i>But to tell you the truth,
I have no idea how this is done in the KSA.</i>

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:53.679
<i>I mean Mr. Alan Clay meeting
Dr. Zahra Hakem outside of the hospital.</i>

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.276
<i>And I hope it doesn't appear
too inappropriate to ask you for advice."</i>

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.909
<i>"I'll pick you up
on Wednesday at noon.</i>

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.036
<i>I'll write your initials on a card</i>

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.829
<i>and put it on the windshield."</i>

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.159
- How are you today?
- Great, great. How are you?

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.470
Very good.
Water?

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:58.996
- I still need to apologize.
- For what?

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:02.516
The other day.
I invaded your privacy.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.036
Oh. Those were unforeseeable
circumstances.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.588
- You seemed troubled.
- I was.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.910
I'm having legal issues
with my husband.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.468
We're getting divorced.
It's ugly.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.915
I had just returned
from court that morning.

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:19.191
And is it all
sorted out now?

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.679
It will be soon,
I think.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.955
It's in his hands,
unfortunately.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:26.271
- You mean legally?
- Yes.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.114
Divorce is complicated
in this country.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.112
It's pretty complicated
in all countries.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.193
So, the drive will be
more than an hour.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:43.718
By the time we get there, we'll know
everything important about each other.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.234
- Okay.
- I have children.

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.796
- I assumed. Me, too.
- You assumed?

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:53.839
Well, maybe not assumed.
I assumed it was possible.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.718
I thought you meant
you saw something in my hips.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.160
You know, the way people can see
from the way a woman walks.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.239
Oh, I'm not
that clever.

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:07.988
- Well, they're teenagers now. They live with me.
- What are their names?

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:12.710
Rania, she's 14,
Mustafa, he's 15.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:16.475
I'm trying to prevent him from
becoming an asshole like his father.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.989
Any advice?

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.595
- Does he tell you anything?
- Did you tell your mother anything?

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.152
Get him alone somewhere.
Something like camping.

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.868
I can't take my son camping.
We don't go camping here.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.837
We don't live in Maine.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:43.196
- How many kids do you have?
- One. A daughter.

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.034
Kit.
She's 21.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:51.272
- Does she tell you anything?
- She does.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.351
But I'm not sure...

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.394
- About what?
- Whether I'm helping.

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:03.391
Does she call you sometimes
with no particular agenda?

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.030
- Yeah.
- Then you're good.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.237
What do you think our kids
would make of this?

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.197
How do you mean?
You and me?

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.874
- The big culture clash?
- I guess so.

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.316
Please. We're separated
by the thinnest filament.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.470
Well, that's
the way I think.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.439
That's the way it is.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.592
- Wow.
- Yes.

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.951
Let me take
your jacket.

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:06.517
Oh, thank you.

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.830
Strange
in a beach house.

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.595
<i>Everyone wants
to be somewhere else.</i>

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.479
It's horrible,
isn't it?

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.357
My brother buys paintings
wherever he goes.

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.953
He has
the worst taste.

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:27.712
- Time to swim.
- Time to swim?

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:31.429
We're going swimming.
You'll borrow my brother's suit.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:55.078
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.273
You go in.
I'll follow.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.709
- Sorry.
- Oh!

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.438
Sorry.

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.353
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- It's all right.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:35.671
I have to get under.
Neighbors.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.108
I must warn you, though.
I'm dressed like you.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.760
So if someone sees us snorkeling,
they'll think it's two men.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:48.710
Just two backs uncovered wearing
men's trunks. You understand?

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:53.114
Wow.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.668
Ah. Yeah.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.357
What now?

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.676
Take a deep breath.
And then let it out slowly.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.239
It's been a long time.

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:05.113
Yeah. Same here.

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.435
<i>How long?</i>

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.439
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.795
<i>Me neither.
I can hardly remember.</i>

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:00.075
I have a story.

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.550
I've been thinking about it
since we spoke about your son.

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:05.676
Ah, please, tell me.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.997
My father and I...

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:11.435
went camping
a few times.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:16.150
- Camping again?
- This is not about camping.

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.394
I was eleven or twelve.

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:23.718
Yeah, this one time,
he brought me up to New Hampshire.

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.476
<i>It was cold,</i>

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.959
<i>'cause it had snowed
a week before.</i>

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.270
<i>And we drove
into this national park.</i>

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:34.148
<i>And we parked and we walked
deep into the woods</i>

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.708
<i>for four hours, at least.</i>

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:41.436
<i>And the sun was already falling,
so we stopped.</i>

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.593
<i>No sign of any civilization
in any direction.</i>

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.318
I thought he had
a plan, you know,

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.029
but he acted like he had just
figured out the math of it all...

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:53.076
That we weren't gonna
get back before dark

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:55.196
and the night
would freeze us solid.

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:58.955
Not to mention the prospect
of wolves, bears.

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.554
- Wolves and bears?
- Yeah.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:05.269
So he asked me,
"What should we do, son?"

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.631
<i>And I realized
this was some kind of a test,</i>

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:12.759
so I thought of all
the Boy Scout stuff I knew

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:16.276
and I said,
"Build a shelter?"

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:20.915
<i>So we got started and we took
turns chopping and tying.</i>

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:24.350
We set it up there,
a perfectly respectable A-frame.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:28.069
We collected fronds from the pine trees
and lined the bottom with them.

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.997
And he says,
"Alan, what do we need now?"

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.756
And I knew.
We needed a needle and thread.

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.798
Or... duct tape.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.995
For what?

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:45.311
To make a sleeping bag
out of our clothes.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.079
<i>We cut up our jackets
and we taped them together</i>

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:49.878
<i>and made a big, wide
sleeping bag.</i>

01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:53.270
<i>And we slept there
in our long underwear.</i>

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:57.990
<i>- And you shared the sleeping bag?
- We did.</i>

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:03.148
And I must say,
when we were all settled in there,

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:04.355
it was really warm.

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:07.079
And you didn't
have a fire?

01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:10.509
No fire.
Just each other.

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.359
And in the morning?

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:18.392
We taped our jackets back
together and went home.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.036
Good.

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.872
<i>Hey, Kit.</i>

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:45.872
<i>I'm writing to tell you
that I'm postponing</i>

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.116
<i>my return
to the United States</i>

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.873
<i>and I don't know
for how long.</i>

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:54.790
<i>The deal I was working on
here in Jeddah didn't happen.</i>

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:59.912
<i>A competitor from China offered
the same technology a lot faster</i>

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.594
<i>and at half the price.</i>

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:04.511
<i>I shouldn't have been surprised,</i>

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:08.275
<i>but there I was, surprised.</i>

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:13.758
<i>So, Kit, the money part
of our lives is not solved just yet,</i>

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:15.273
<i>but I'm working on it.</i>

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:19.150
<i>I've taken a new job here
which pays pretty well.</i>

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:23.552
<i>It should be enough even to get you
back into school next semester.</i>

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:29.913
<i>Keep believing, Kit,
'cause I believe in you.</i>

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.835
<i>You're strong and young
and you have time.</i>

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:38.037
<i>I'm not so young,
but I have to tell you,</i>

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.076
<i>there's a force
in my life now</i>

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:43.391
<i>that makes me
feel strong again.</i>

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:46.438
<i>And I feel that there's time.</i>

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.035
<i>There must be time.</i>
