WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:05.589
Yes?

00:05.672 --> 00:07.174
- Hey.
- Hello.

00:07.257 --> 00:09.927
- You're new.
- I started yesterday.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.428
- What's your name?
- Leisal.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.640
Okay. I'm Brigitte. This is Gretel.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.894
- Emily and Richard are expecting us.
- I'm sorry.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.312
Please come in.

00:24.608 --> 00:27.611
Can I get you a drink?

00:28.612 --> 00:31.448
I can get it.
Why don't you go hide in the kitchen?

00:31.532 --> 00:33.325
Really? Thank you.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.119
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.664
I think George and Martha
are joining us for dinner.

00:38.747 --> 00:42.543
I didn't know my every conversation
had to be reported. I stand corrected.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.087
I have been the co-chair
of the Starlight Foundation...

00:45.170 --> 00:47.130
- for the last eight years.
- I know this.

00:47.214 --> 00:50.425
The Black and White Ball is the main
fundraising event of the season.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.970
- It's one year.
- The co-chair cannot miss...

00:53.053 --> 00:55.055
- the main fundraising event.
- Why?

00:55.138 --> 00:57.516
- Won't the chair be there?
- Is this a joke to you?

00:57.599 --> 01:00.143
I have too many things
to take care of at work.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.980
I don't have time for frivolous parties.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.730
Frivolous parties?

01:06.692 --> 01:09.236
Where are you going? Come back here.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.780
- This is bad.
- I know. I wish we had popcorn.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.031
- Mom.
- Incoming.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.409
'The Hartford Zoological silent auction...

01:15.492 --> 01:18.036
'the Mark Twain House
Restoration Fund luncheon...

01:18.120 --> 01:20.289
'the Harriet Beecher Stowe
Literacy Auction. '

01:20.372 --> 01:22.082
I can read those myself.

01:22.165 --> 01:25.627
This is the fourth event
you have turned down on our behalf.

01:25.711 --> 01:28.088
I am on the board
of all of those foundations.

01:28.172 --> 01:31.049
- How does that make me look?
- Like your husband is busy...

01:31.091 --> 01:34.636
- and has a lot of responsibility.
- I have responsibilities, too.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.015
I understand that your social engagements
are important.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.975
They're not just social engagements.

01:40.058 --> 01:43.103
Anything at which you serve tea
is a social engagement.

01:43.187 --> 01:45.898
I am getting a tape recorder
so you can hear how pompous...

01:45.981 --> 01:47.733
and condescending you sound.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.777
I don't want you to take my word for it.
I might be delirious...

01:50.861 --> 01:53.113
- from all that tea I've been drinking.
- Stop.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.615
Maybe we should leave.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.700
Are you kidding?
We have dinner theater here.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.827
But Grandma and Grandpa are in a fight.

01:58.911 --> 02:01.038
- Yeah.
- They wouldn't want us to see it.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.248
We stumbled in here
completely innocently.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.667
We came for dinner, as usual,
per their request.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.628
We didn't know we'd see The Lion King
without the puppet heads.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.339
Get that thing out of my face.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.883
- Say the tea thing again.
- You're acting like a child.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.220
Turn around when you talk.
I'm not sure this microphone is good.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.346
What?

02:19.097 --> 02:20.807
Brava! Encore!

02:20.891 --> 02:24.269
Does Terrence McNally know
about you two? Get me the phone!

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:22.077 --> 03:25.330
It sucks. I know it sucks.
Just tell me it sucks.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.834
It's great.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.586
- No, it's not.
- It's an 'A.'

03:30.669 --> 03:31.795
- Don't lie.
- A-plus.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.964
- You're my mom.
- Is anything higher than A-plus?

03:34.047 --> 03:36.633
- You have to say that.
- An A-plus with a crown and a wand.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.385
This is not how you raise a child.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.804
You don't send them out
with a false sense of pride.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.849
Because in the real world,
no one will coddle you.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.268
I'd rather know now
if I'll be working at CNN...

03:46.351 --> 03:49.354
or carrying a basket around its offices
with sandwiches.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.981
- Rory.
- Yeah?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.441
It's great.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.776
- Really?
- Really, really.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.487
- Thank you.
- Coffee.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.034
- What do you want? Eggs, toast, combo?
- What's the rush?

04:02.075 --> 04:05.662
I'm swamped this morning.
I was supposed to have help, but I don't.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.831
So order now, or I'm bringing you both...

04:07.915 --> 04:09.958
an egg-white omelet
with steamed spinach.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.210
- Pancakes.
- French toast.

04:11.293 --> 04:12.628
Thank you.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.588
You were supposed to be down here...

04:15.797 --> 04:17.423
- What the hell is that?
- What?

04:17.507 --> 04:19.885
- That.
- That is a shirt.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.261
- Change.
- What?

04:21.345 --> 04:24.097
- Go upstairs and change your shirt.
- I like this shirt.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.517
- How can you like it?
- It brings out my eyes.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.228
Part of the deal of you staying here
is that you work here.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.730
When you work here,
you will wear proper work attire.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.440
That is not proper work attire.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.693
Go upstairs and change into something
that won't scare my customers.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.946
Whatever you say, Uncle Luke.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.031
- Gross T-shirt.
- Yeah.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.741
- Good band.
- Yeah.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.326
Thank you.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.497
- Another new one, Emily?
- Yes.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.707
The last one
only made it through one evening.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.252
- Thoroughly nervous creature.
- What do you do to them?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.754
The usual. 'Clean this, cook that...

04:55.796 --> 04:59.758
- 'sacrifice a virgin on your way out. '
- The things you say.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.803
We could have done with some of that
at the ball the other night.

05:02.886 --> 05:03.887
Was it dull?

05:03.971 --> 05:06.932
I felt like my shoes
were going out of style as I sat there.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.268
- What a shame.
- It wasn't all dull.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.770
- Are we forgetting Truly Bishop?
- That's right.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.397
What about Truly Bishop?

05:13.480 --> 05:16.441
- She and Eugene split up last month.
- What?

05:17.693 --> 05:20.737
You knew about that.
They had this huge fight at the...

05:20.821 --> 05:23.824
That's right.
You missed the Schaffers' cocktail party.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.993
They broke up
at the Schaffers' cocktail party?

05:26.076 --> 05:27.953
He has another family in Salisbury.

05:27.995 --> 05:31.081
- No.
- She's 26, with a 2-year-old.

05:31.165 --> 05:34.126
- How did Truly find out?
- The little tart sent her a letter.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.753
- Oh, my God.
- So Truly confronted Eugene...

05:36.837 --> 05:39.173
after consuming a bottle and a half
of Cristal...

05:39.256 --> 05:42.885
and he said he was going to leave her
and marry the Salisbury concubine.

05:42.968 --> 05:45.387
- What did she do?
- Threw an ice sculpture at his head.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.763
I can't believe I missed that.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.641
- You've missed everything lately.
- Where have you been?

05:49.683 --> 05:52.686
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, it's just Richard.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.813
He hasn't been hanging out in Salisbury?

05:54.897 --> 05:58.025
No. He's been swamped at work,
night and day, weekends.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.777
Like he was the only person
who worked at that company.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.571
Plus, he hasn't been feeling very well.

06:02.654 --> 06:05.449
His back and knees, very bad knees.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.494
Rory, what a nice surprise.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.039
- Sorry to butt in like this.
- Nonsense.

06:12.122 --> 06:16.126
Come and meet my friends. I'd like you
to meet my granddaughter Rory.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.170
- Hello, Rory.
- Nice to meet you.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.672
My goodness, what a pretty girl you are.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.467
- She looks just like Lorelai, doesn't she?
- The eyes.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.511
- The nose.
- Walk around, sweetie.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.721
- Leave the girl alone.
- I want to see the walk.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.474
- Lorelai had such a specific walk.
- Fast.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.227
- That was it.
- Sit. Would you like some tea?

06:33.310 --> 06:36.313
No, I came to pick up a book
that Grandpa was supposed to leave.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.316
- Check his study, it might be on his desk.
- Thanks.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.569
Your granddaughter is just lovely.
How old is she?

06:42.653 --> 06:45.280
- Sixteen.
- That's a nice age.

06:45.364 --> 06:49.117
- Have you thought about her debut?
- No, not yet.

06:49.201 --> 06:52.829
The Daughters of the Daughters of
the American Revolution Debutante Ball...

06:52.871 --> 06:55.582
- is next week.
- It is? I hadn't realized.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.960
Why don't you present Rory there?

06:58.043 --> 07:00.337
I don't know. Isn't it a little late?

07:00.420 --> 07:03.382
Please. For Emily Gilmore
I'm sure they'll bend the rules.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.550
You have to.

07:04.633 --> 07:07.219
With a girl like that,
you'll be the hit of the ball.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.263
She'd definitely be the prettiest one.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.474
- Except for Katie Hethington.
- No. Didn't you hear?

07:12.558 --> 07:15.227
Katie fell off her horse.
There's a scab on her face.

07:15.269 --> 07:19.147
Well, then, if Katie Hethington
has a scab on her face...

07:19.231 --> 07:21.608
Rory will definitely be
the prettiest one there.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.902
It'll be your crowning moment.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.529
I found it.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.455
- I'm coming out.
- Out of what?

07:35.539 --> 07:37.708
- Out into society.
- What are you talking about?

07:37.791 --> 07:40.878
- I went to Grandma's house after school.
- Right away, bad.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.922
Her DAR friends are all there,
they're talking about...

07:43.964 --> 07:46.425
- this Debutante Ball that's being thrown.
- Oh, no.

07:46.508 --> 07:50.179
When I got back from Grandpa's office,
they invited me onto the patio.

07:50.262 --> 07:53.724
- Tell me you did not go onto the patio.
- I went onto the patio.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.894
That's like accepting the position
as the drummer in Spinal Tap.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.104
Grandma told me how important it is...

07:59.188 --> 08:01.732
for a person to be properly presented
to society.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.234
And how every young girl
dreams of this day.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.736
- And how there are flowers.
- Lord.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.987
- And music.
- Please.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.989
- And cake.
- The cake's actually good.

08:09.072 --> 08:12.701
Before I knew it, Grandma brought out
your old dress, I tried it on...

08:12.784 --> 08:15.162
- What are you doing?
- Getting you out of this.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.457
My mother is great
at getting someone to agree...

08:18.499 --> 08:21.627
to something that in another universe
they would never consider.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.379
I am convinced she had something
to do with Lily Tomlin...

08:24.463 --> 08:27.508
- doing that movie with John Travolta.
- I'm doing this.

08:27.591 --> 08:28.634
Why?

08:28.717 --> 08:31.637
You should've seen
Grandma's face when she asked me.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.514
- It's really important to her.
- But...

08:33.597 --> 08:37.726
If it's important to her and not important
to me, then why shouldn't I do it?

08:37.808 --> 08:40.562
Do you know
what a coming-out party says?

08:40.645 --> 08:42.731
- It says, 'I'm a woman now. '
- No, it says:

08:42.813 --> 08:46.360
'Hi, I'm Rory. I'm of good breeding
and marriageable age.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.820
'I will now parade around in front of...

08:48.862 --> 08:51.698
'young men of similarly good breeding
and marriageable age...

08:51.782 --> 08:54.493
- 'so they can take a good look at me. '
- You're exaggerating.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.329
It's like animals being up for bid
at the county fair...

08:57.371 --> 09:00.249
- except sheep don't wear hoop skirts.
- I promised.

09:00.332 --> 09:04.753
- But you don't have to be a part of it.
- Lf you want to do it, I'll help.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.630
It's just weird.

09:06.713 --> 09:11.260
This is all the stuff I ran away from.
I just assumed you'd be running with me.

09:11.343 --> 09:15.305
I would, but I heard debutantes don't run,
something about the heels.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.642
All right, then.
If you're sure, where do we start?

09:20.185 --> 09:24.064
Let's see, you have a dress.
You need a dowry, I guess.

09:24.147 --> 09:27.109
There you go. And you'll need shoes...

09:27.192 --> 09:31.029
hose, gloves, some mice, a dog,
a pumpkin.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.033
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.705
It says your father is supposed
to present you at the ceremony.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.333
Whatever. I can get someone else to do it.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.919
- Grandpa, probably. Or Taylor.
- Okay.

09:46.003 --> 09:49.131
Or the cable guy, he looked friendly
last week. He may have a tux.

09:49.214 --> 09:52.217
- Hand me the phone.
- I was kidding about the cable guy.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.344
- What are you doing?
- There are many things...

09:54.428 --> 09:56.555
that should weird you out
about coming out...

09:56.638 --> 09:59.808
but inviting your father
shouldn't be one of them.

09:59.892 --> 10:01.894
The number you have dialed has changed.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.061
Gum wrapper.

10:03.145 --> 10:06.356
- He's not going to come.
- You don't know until you ask.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.736
- Mom.
- Look, we call, we ask.

10:10.777 --> 10:14.615
There's no harm. Trust me,
the cable guy's not going anywhere.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.910
- Hello?
- Hi!

10:18.535 --> 10:20.245
- Where the hell are you?
- Boston.

10:20.329 --> 10:21.830
- Boston?
- Yeah.

10:21.914 --> 10:24.458
Baked beans, cream pie,
tea party, strangler.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.043
- That Boston.
- And you?

10:26.126 --> 10:27.294
- Me?
- Where are you?

10:27.377 --> 10:28.754
- Helsinki.
- Really?

10:28.795 --> 10:31.465
I got the girl band together.
After opening stateside...

10:31.548 --> 10:34.801
we headed across the Atlantic,
now we're huge with the Nordic set.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.929
Good to hear you.
We haven't talked in a while.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.430
You could have called, too.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.807
Or does your phone only receive calls?

10:40.891 --> 10:42.601
I figured you had a lot going on...

10:42.643 --> 10:45.896
what with the engagement
and the canceling of the engagement.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.190
- How's that going?
- Still canceled.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.399
- You okay?
- Good.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.568
I'm even better
when I'm not talking about it.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.613
- Moving on, then.
- I have some shocking news.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.032
- Rory's coming out.
- Out of what?

10:57.115 --> 11:00.035
Coming out: White dresses,
gloves, curtsies.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.620
- Stop it.
- I swear to God.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.038
You're letting her do it?

11:03.121 --> 11:06.583
I wasn't about to let her use
my method of getting out of it.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.835
This is crazy.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.754
She's doing it as a favor to my mom.
Can't talk her out of it.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.340
Did you tell her about
Barbara Hutton, Doris Duke?

11:13.423 --> 11:16.093
Yes, and she's perfectly willing
to marry Cary Grant...

11:16.134 --> 11:19.137
get offed by her crazy butler,
and start designing blue jeans...

11:19.179 --> 11:20.639
as soon as the ball ends.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.391
If that's what she wants.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.810
Now comes the reason for my phone call.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.812
All your regular 976 numbers were busy.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.981
I know this is totally not your thing...

11:29.064 --> 11:32.609
but as you will remember, part of
the coming-out process involves...

11:32.693 --> 11:36.113
the girls being escorted
around the dance floor by their dads.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.950
Now, I know you would rather
sit through Endless Love...

11:40.033 --> 11:42.953
than ever be a part of this scene again...

11:43.036 --> 11:47.541
but this is important to your daughter,
and she's never asked you for anything.

11:47.624 --> 11:51.378
Although no one's keeping track,
it seems your constant non-presence...

11:51.461 --> 11:55.132
in her life, and your lack of showing up
when you say you're going to...

11:55.174 --> 11:57.009
or calling when you say you're going to...

11:57.092 --> 11:59.595
or basically doing anything
when you say you will...

11:59.678 --> 12:02.681
would tend to indicate
that you owe her big time.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.976
Now, before you say no,
I want you to take a minute...

12:06.268 --> 12:09.313
and remember you have
a great daughter who needs you.

12:09.396 --> 12:13.066
She has a mother who will hunt you down
like a half-price Kate Spade purse...

12:13.150 --> 12:15.652
- if you disappoint her.
- Okay. I'm there.

12:16.486 --> 12:20.032
You mean the Daughters of the American
Revolution Annual Debutante ball?

12:20.115 --> 12:21.116
Yes.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.869
- Don't make this promise if you can't.
- I wouldn't miss it.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.497
- It's next weekend.
- I'll clear my schedule.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.874
- You swear?
- Wait, next weekend?

12:28.957 --> 12:31.001
- Christopher.
- I'm kidding.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.836
I will definitely be there.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.340
In exchange, I'll refrain from saying
the 10 things that came to mind...

12:36.381 --> 12:38.133
for making fun of your schedule.

12:38.217 --> 12:39.968
- Thanks.
- Bye.

12:40.844 --> 12:44.223
Hey, little debbie,
your dad is definitely gonna be there.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.516
- You're kidding.
- No.

12:45.557 --> 12:49.728
He's gonna walk you down the stairs,
turn you in a circle, watch you curtsy...

12:49.770 --> 12:53.065
and announce that Rory Gilmore
is officially open for business.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.817
- He definitely said 'definitely'?
- Definitely.

12:55.901 --> 12:59.738
- So there's a 50-50 chance?
- He sounded pretty sure. I'd say 60-40.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.247
No, Mom, I'm sure one crinoline
will be plenty.

13:08.330 --> 13:09.915
No, she doesn't.

13:10.666 --> 13:12.459
I'm sure she doesn't.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.545
In what scenario
would I have bought Rory...

13:14.628 --> 13:16.755
elbow-length kidskin gloves?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.883
Sorry, in what scenario on my planet...

13:19.967 --> 13:23.303
would I have bought Rory
elbow-length kidskin gloves?

13:24.638 --> 13:25.931
- So?
- So what?

13:26.014 --> 13:27.057
It's good, huh?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.101
It's the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame Induction.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.854
- Doesn't Neil Young look cool?
- I guess.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.814
If you'll notice, he's wearing a tux.

13:33.897 --> 13:37.401
He looks cool because he's Neil Young,
not because he's wearing a tux.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.487
I don't have to ask her, Mom,
'cause I know the answer.

13:40.571 --> 13:42.948
I know the answer, Mom.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.660
Yeah. No. Well, I don't have to ask her...

13:47.744 --> 13:48.954
Hold on.

13:50.914 --> 13:55.294
Would you like Grandma's hairstylist
to come and set your hair before the ball?

13:55.460 --> 13:58.839
I did not coach her.
Go back to talking about gloves.

13:59.590 --> 14:02.384
- You're gonna look great in a tux.
- Tails.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.554
- What?
- According to this it says that:

14:05.637 --> 14:07.639
'All escorts must be properly attired...

14:07.723 --> 14:10.851
'in black tails, white cummerbunds,
and white gloves. '

14:10.934 --> 14:13.020
- What?
- I'm sure the gloves are optional.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.938
Not according to this.

14:15.022 --> 14:18.192
- Tails? Gloves?
- Remember Neil Young.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.111
Remember that you love me.

14:21.820 --> 14:25.741
Remember that I'll be watching
BattleBots with you for a month.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.785
Show me Neil Young again.

14:30.829 --> 14:31.914
Dad!

14:36.502 --> 14:40.464
Whoa! Hold it. A lady never runs out
to meet a gentleman caller...

14:40.506 --> 14:41.632
who hasn't been announced.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.759
We haven't tamed my wild ways yet.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.512
- Thank God I'm here now.
- I missed you.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.222
- Me, too.
- Hey.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.516
- What is this?
- What?

14:50.724 --> 14:53.644
- God, where did this come from?
- What happened to your bike?

14:53.685 --> 14:56.021
Crazy game of key exchange
at the car wash.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.981
- This is a car.
- Yes, it is.

14:58.065 --> 15:01.276
It has four wheels and a roof
and air bags...

15:01.360 --> 15:04.530
and seat belts, and my God,
it smells like a forest.

15:04.613 --> 15:09.159
Well, I needed a little more space.
Had something big to haul.

15:10.244 --> 15:12.454
I believe this belongs to you.

15:12.538 --> 15:15.332
- The Compact Oxford English Dictionary.
- I'd promised you.

15:15.374 --> 15:16.959
- Sorry it took so long.
- That's okay.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.710
This is the new edition.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.171
The old one doesn't have
the word 'jiggy' in it.

15:21.255 --> 15:23.715
Thank you. I love it.
I'll look things up right now.

15:23.799 --> 15:24.800
Wait!

15:25.342 --> 15:26.718
- Thanks.
- Go.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.347
- That was really great of you.
- Thank you.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.891
- Back to mocking my car?
- Yeah. A Volvo sedan.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.935
- Are you kidding?
- This is a great car.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.771
- For driving to bingo.
- It just seemed like time.

15:37.855 --> 15:39.982
I couldn't keep showing up for work
on my bike.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.483
- Work?
- You've heard of it?

15:41.567 --> 15:43.235
Yes, but I didn't think you had.

15:43.318 --> 15:46.822
Took a while, I kept getting it mixed up
with 'nap,' but I figured it out.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.241
So you bought a car and got a job.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.076
Actually, job, then car.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.620
- 'Cause it's more responsible that way.
- Exactly.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.706
Wow! So tell me about the job.

15:55.789 --> 16:00.043
I show up every day, drink bad coffee,
exchange lame pleasantries...

16:00.127 --> 16:03.589
with Linda from marketing, and after
two weeks, they give me a paycheck.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.966
- It's a pretty cool system.
- You're serious?

16:06.049 --> 16:08.051
You know how us working types are.
Get in.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.721
I'm not supposed to take rides
with strangers.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.764
- Trust me.
- Yes, but only if...

16:12.848 --> 16:16.393
you promise we won't go over
25 miles an hour on the motorway.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.397
Oh, my God.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.816
George Lucas wishes
he had this sound system.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.986
Got Alpine head units, two subs,
and two 12s.

16:26.069 --> 16:30.324
- In exchange, no passenger-side air bag.
- So the old Christopher still lives.

16:30.407 --> 16:33.619
Could you please attenuate
the cacophony out here?

16:35.329 --> 16:37.122
Turn down the music.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.792
Next time, instead of a dictionary,
just slip her a crisp $20.

16:40.876 --> 16:41.960
Deal.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.798
Twelve pairs of pantyhose.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.635
It's going to be a long night.
She's bound to have a run.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.303
Twelve pairs.

16:51.386 --> 16:55.390
There's the presentation, the circle,
the curtsy, the fan dance.

16:55.557 --> 16:59.269
Mom, there'd have to be a 12-kilometer
run and a jujitsu demonstration...

16:59.353 --> 17:01.355
for her to go through
12 pairs of pantyhose.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.440
Does it really hurt to be prepared?

17:03.524 --> 17:06.318
- No, it doesn't hurt to be prepared.
- Thank you.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.819
The good news is, now she is prepared...

17:08.904 --> 17:12.324
for her high-school graduation,
her college graduation, her marriage...

17:12.406 --> 17:15.911
three to five anniversaries, a hostess gig,
and jury duty...

17:15.993 --> 17:19.289
- especially if she's sequestered.
- You make me tired.

17:19.373 --> 17:21.583
Richard, I didn't know you were home.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.044
Yes, well, we learn something every day.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.128
- You didn't have to work?
- I am working.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.549
Guess how many pairs of pantyhose
we bought?

17:28.632 --> 17:30.175
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.

17:30.259 --> 17:33.512
I got you some beautiful new cuff links
for this weekend.

17:33.554 --> 17:34.805
I already have cuff links.

17:34.847 --> 17:38.684
- But these have bulldogs on them. Look.
- I'll look at them later.

17:38.767 --> 17:39.852
All right, fine.

17:39.935 --> 17:42.437
Remember to get your tux
from the cleaners tomorrow.

17:42.521 --> 17:44.982
- No time.
- It's around the corner from your office.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.900
- I have to go in early tomorrow.
- Go now.

17:46.984 --> 17:48.652
- I am busy now.
- Doing what?

17:48.694 --> 17:51.530
I am not going to qualify my time
with you.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.657
I am not going to pick up my tuxedo.

17:53.699 --> 17:56.910
You planned this ridiculous affair,
you pick up my tuxedo.

17:56.994 --> 17:58.745
Or I simply don't have to go.

17:58.829 --> 18:01.707
Either one of these options
is fine with me.

18:08.589 --> 18:12.259
Hey, Mom, I might be reading
too much into this...

18:12.342 --> 18:14.428
but is something going on
between you and Dad?

18:14.511 --> 18:15.679
What are you talking about?

18:15.721 --> 18:18.849
He just seems a little less jolly than usual.

18:18.891 --> 18:20.767
- He's just busy.
- He seems upset.

18:20.851 --> 18:22.436
- He's not.
- You seem upset.

18:22.519 --> 18:25.230
- I'm not. We're both fine.
- Okay. My mistake.

18:25.564 --> 18:27.816
I'd better go pick up his tux.

18:31.737 --> 18:33.864
Keep counting in your heads.

18:33.906 --> 18:36.700
Look each other in the eye.
Dean, are you leading?

18:36.742 --> 18:39.244
- I have no idea.
- Okay, stop.

18:39.745 --> 18:42.873
Remember, one of the most important
things in ballroom dancing...

18:42.915 --> 18:44.249
is to remember to spot.

18:44.333 --> 18:47.586
Otherwise, you're gonna get dizzy.
So what you want to do...

18:47.669 --> 18:50.172
is pick out something to focus on.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.925
I usually like to find a lonely seaman.

18:53.217 --> 18:56.803
Then when turning, whip your head
around and find your spot again.

18:56.887 --> 18:59.306
Hello, sailor.

19:00.849 --> 19:02.392
Now you try it.

19:04.269 --> 19:05.687
You got to be kidding me.

19:05.771 --> 19:08.357
You can do it
without the 'hello, sailor' part.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.776
- BattleBots.
- For the rest of your life.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.861
Now take it from the top.

19:18.492 --> 19:20.953
Hey. You guys are really improving.

19:21.036 --> 19:24.122
- Now you're actually facing each other.
- Anyone need a break?

19:24.206 --> 19:28.627
Okay, take five, but don't sit down
because your muscles will get cold.

19:30.128 --> 19:33.257
- So how's it going?
- Actually, I'm not very good.

19:33.340 --> 19:36.051
Which is really holding me back,
because I'm a natural.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.595
Maybe you need a glittery glove
and a freaky face.

19:38.679 --> 19:42.057
Miss Patty thought Dean would
get hurt, and she made me sit and watch.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.934
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

19:43.976 --> 19:47.145
It's not your fault. Ballroom dancing
is a wonderfully sexist thing.

19:47.229 --> 19:51.483
Any woman can do it. All she needs
is a strong male lead. No offence.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.362
- Well, almost any woman can do it.
- I wasn't ready.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.447
- I want a do over.
- Fine.

19:58.574 --> 19:59.908
May I have this dance?

19:59.992 --> 20:03.537
I don't know. Do you have a trust fund?
Always make sure.

20:41.033 --> 20:42.451
Okay, I'm adopted.

20:42.534 --> 20:44.411
I'm never gonna be able to do that.

20:44.495 --> 20:46.163
You guys just need some practice.

20:46.205 --> 20:50.417
Listen to your father, Rory.
Your adorable father.

20:50.501 --> 20:53.629
Let's get you out of here
before you become Patty's next husband.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.130
See you guys later.

20:56.131 --> 20:59.468
- Bye, Patty.
- The way you toy with me.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.180
Did you know you still knew
how to do that?

21:03.222 --> 21:05.182
I wish I didn't. Imagine what we could do...

21:05.224 --> 21:08.227
if we freed up the brain space
it holds on the Viennese waltz.

21:08.268 --> 21:12.356
It's right up there between Brady Bunch
reruns and the lyrics to Rapture.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.901
I got to say,
this isn't like the chai lattes in Boston.

21:15.984 --> 21:20.072
Expecting Luke to make a chai anything
was completely insane.

21:20.155 --> 21:22.991
I'm pretty sure he just threw
a cinnamon stick in some tea.

21:23.075 --> 21:24.993
I'm pretty sure it's not a cinnamon stick.

21:25.077 --> 21:26.954
Okay, throwing this out now.

21:27.037 --> 21:29.623
So, chai latte, when did that happen?

21:29.915 --> 21:32.751
I don't know.
Everyone at work drinks them.

21:33.126 --> 21:36.755
Since you still haven't told me
what exactly it is that you do...

21:36.839 --> 21:40.384
I'm gonna go with yoga instructor
or chiropractor.

21:40.425 --> 21:43.554
It's actually interesting.
I'm working for this firm that helps...

21:43.595 --> 21:47.266
overblown tech companies scale back
and stay afloat in leaner times.

21:47.307 --> 21:51.228
- I'm sorry, what's the interesting part?
- We dress like superheroes when we do it.

21:51.270 --> 21:52.354
Nice.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.898
How long will you be able
to keep this going?

21:54.940 --> 21:57.067
I'm happy there,
I'd say at least till Tuesday.

21:57.109 --> 21:59.653
- So, long-term.
- You know, it's weird.

21:59.736 --> 22:03.323
I hated the idea of having to be
somewhere at a specific time each day...

22:03.407 --> 22:06.034
but it turns out I like the stability.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.911
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:07.953 --> 22:12.499
I like that at the end of the day, I feel like
I've done something, earned something.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.835
I think that's really great.

22:14.918 --> 22:18.005
Only took me 10 years
and several failed business ventures...

22:18.088 --> 22:20.424
- to figure out what I wanted.
- Which is?

22:20.465 --> 22:24.428
Not my parents' life.
Something you figured out at 16.

22:24.469 --> 22:28.015
Actually, six months,
but I just couldn't vocalize it yet.

22:28.098 --> 22:30.809
You knew what you wanted,
you went out and got it.

22:30.851 --> 22:33.103
I was always a little jealous of you.

22:33.145 --> 22:35.272
You seem to be catching up.

22:37.149 --> 22:38.400
We did good.

22:39.610 --> 22:42.362
Yeah. Well, I did good.

22:42.863 --> 22:45.949
The fact that she can't follow lead
is all you.

22:50.996 --> 22:55.709
See, only a lady can gracefully walk
around a room with a book on her head...

22:55.792 --> 22:57.503
while eating kung pao chicken.

22:57.544 --> 23:00.047
A great lady can spit the peanuts
into the container...

23:00.130 --> 23:01.423
- without anyone noticing.
- Wow.

23:01.507 --> 23:03.467
Well, don't be intimidated.

23:03.509 --> 23:05.594
You have to practice a lot
to get to my level.

23:05.677 --> 23:08.055
- Anyone want the last egg roll?
- No.

23:08.138 --> 23:09.515
Where are you going?

23:09.556 --> 23:11.725
- To get the egg roll.
- You're getting it yourself?

23:11.808 --> 23:12.976
- Yes.
- No!

23:13.018 --> 23:16.355
Ladies never get their egg rolls,
they never get their own anything.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.357
- Not even their own ideas.
- Oh, boy.

23:18.398 --> 23:21.276
They sit helplessly and wait
for some young, strong man...

23:21.360 --> 23:22.694
to come by and assist them.

23:22.778 --> 23:24.696
They don't step in puddles
or over puddles.

23:24.738 --> 23:27.741
They can't even look at puddles.
They need to be blindfolded...

23:27.825 --> 23:29.827
and thrown in a sack
and carried over puddles.

23:29.868 --> 23:32.871
Isn't there a moratorium on how long
ladies should talk?

23:32.913 --> 23:36.291
No. Repeat after me,
'I am completely helpless. '

23:36.375 --> 23:38.669
You put the left side
through the back loop...

23:38.710 --> 23:41.380
and you tug a little bit on both sides...

23:41.421 --> 23:44.883
and you, my friend,
might just be mistaken for a gentleman.

23:44.925 --> 23:46.343
Or a waiter.

23:47.052 --> 23:48.929
How do you know how to do this?

23:49.012 --> 23:51.390
Seventeen cotillions,
a dozen debutante balls...

23:51.473 --> 23:54.852
and a scarring experiment with
the Children of the American Revolution.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.395
Where you wear only the bow tie.

23:56.436 --> 24:01.024
A good idea on conception, but the sudden
snowstorm instantly dampened the effect.

24:01.066 --> 24:04.486
Hey, do you think it's cool
when Neil Young wears a tux?

24:04.570 --> 24:07.155
Yeah, of course, but it's Neil Young.

24:08.073 --> 24:11.410
All right, I should get going.
I'll see you at 3:00.

24:12.744 --> 24:13.871
Wait.

24:14.288 --> 24:15.747
- What's this?
- Your gloves.

24:15.831 --> 24:19.251
- I thought you were kidding.
- No. Ladies never kid.

24:21.503 --> 24:22.838
- Bye.
- Bye.

24:23.172 --> 24:25.215
- I'm going to bed, too.
- Do you need help?

24:25.257 --> 24:27.342
- No.
- Wrong. The correct answer is yes.

24:27.426 --> 24:30.470
- Ladies need help with everything.
- Good night.

24:32.306 --> 24:35.100
I don't know how
she's ever gonna make it in society.

24:35.142 --> 24:38.687
At this rate, she's gonna get a job
and only marry once.

24:38.979 --> 24:41.106
- Calling your mom again?
- I don't get it.

24:41.190 --> 24:44.443
Every five minutes last week,
she called to check on shoe fittings...

24:44.484 --> 24:47.613
and curtsy progress, and if I talked Rory
into putting her hair up.

24:47.696 --> 24:49.114
Then tonight, nothing.

24:49.156 --> 24:52.201
I'm sure they have a lot of getting ready
to do for themselves.

24:52.284 --> 24:54.536
She's been acting so weird lately.

24:54.620 --> 24:57.039
They're fighting, openly fighting.

24:57.456 --> 25:00.584
They've never done that before.
I'm not sure what to do about it.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.753
Move to California. That's what I do.

25:02.836 --> 25:05.130
My father
doesn't even want to go tomorrow.

25:05.172 --> 25:08.800
His perfect angel granddaughter
is being presented to society...

25:08.884 --> 25:11.011
in front of his friends and colleagues.

25:11.094 --> 25:14.556
Something he never got to do
with his bad, loser, evil daughter.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.808
Maybe you should talk to them.

25:16.892 --> 25:20.187
I'm sorry, was that me?
I must have had an aneurysm.

25:20.521 --> 25:22.481
Nothing more I can do tonight.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.733
I'm going to bed.
Want me to turn off the lights?

25:24.816 --> 25:28.362
Actually, I have to stay up
and do a little work tonight.

25:28.779 --> 25:32.449
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting that
that's not a joke anymore.

25:32.491 --> 25:33.826
Good night.

25:40.374 --> 25:42.125
This place is huge.

25:43.210 --> 25:46.129
- Do I have to walk down those stairs?
- I'm afraid so.

25:46.171 --> 25:50.008
Unless you want to make a memorable
entrance and slide down the banister...

25:50.092 --> 25:52.052
which I totally encourage, by the way.

25:52.135 --> 25:53.929
- You are...
- Lorelai Gilmore.

25:54.012 --> 25:55.889
...late.
- Sorry. My fault.

25:56.473 --> 25:57.808
Took me a while to get pretty.

25:57.850 --> 26:01.228
Not all of us are 16 anymore,
you know what I mean? No.

26:01.311 --> 26:04.481
You are to head up the stairs.
The preparation room is on the right.

26:04.523 --> 26:07.693
Look for the toxic cloud
of Chanel and Final Net.

26:13.907 --> 26:16.827
Hang your dress there.
Put your makeup on over there.

26:16.869 --> 26:19.204
You'll have to make do
with a non-lighted mirror.

26:19.246 --> 26:22.291
The lighted ones went to the girls
that were here before dawn.

26:22.374 --> 26:23.792
Listen up, ladies!

26:23.876 --> 26:27.546
Everyone must be beautiful
and ready to go by 7:30.

26:32.384 --> 26:36.388
- Can't believe we have an hour and a half.
- I'm never gonna be ready in time.

26:36.471 --> 26:39.016
God knows when the swelling on my nose
is gonna go down.

26:39.099 --> 26:42.728
I had to go and inherit
my father's nose. I'm Libby.

26:43.562 --> 26:47.107
Which one should I wear?
I thought all month and I cannot decide.

26:47.191 --> 26:49.067
Well, that's a tough one.

26:49.109 --> 26:51.695
I know. This is red-red,
and this is orange-red.

26:51.737 --> 26:54.698
The wrong one,
and I will look like a hooker or a teacher.

26:54.740 --> 26:55.991
That's a lot of pressure.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.910
The two minutes you stand on the stairs...

26:57.993 --> 27:00.746
will determine your social status
for the rest of your life.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.123
Wow. What if you trip?

27:04.249 --> 27:07.628
I mean, not that you would.
You wouldn't. I might.

27:07.711 --> 27:10.923
Probably will, actually.
Could be a Cirque du Soleil kind of night.

27:11.006 --> 27:13.884
You should not even joke
about stuff like that.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.386
There's a head under there.

27:18.055 --> 27:20.015
You are a wonderful man.

27:20.098 --> 27:22.976
I have a feeling
we're gonna be very close tonight.

27:25.687 --> 27:28.440
- Mom, you're here.
- Where should I be, Spain?

27:28.482 --> 27:31.276
I tried calling you all night last night.

27:31.443 --> 27:34.738
- I was very busy.
- And then we got here before you.

27:34.780 --> 27:37.616
- What is your point?
- Nothing. It's just weird.

27:37.658 --> 27:40.285
Well, I'm here now,
so it's not weird anymore.

27:40.369 --> 27:42.871
Look at these flowers. Baby's breath.

27:42.955 --> 27:44.832
What is this, County General?

27:44.915 --> 27:46.875
You look very nice. I like your dress.

27:46.959 --> 27:50.420
Cotton tablecloths, folding chairs.
It's not supposed to be like this.

27:50.504 --> 27:53.799
- In my day, people sat in real chairs.
- Mom, what's the matter?

27:53.882 --> 27:56.802
I wanted my granddaughter
to be presented to society...

27:56.885 --> 28:00.013
in a beautiful, elegant ballroom,
not a Shakey's.

28:00.097 --> 28:02.724
The room is beautiful.
You're being too critical.

28:02.808 --> 28:05.519
There's Nan. I'm going
to have a little talk with her...

28:05.602 --> 28:07.813
about the proper height for a taper.

28:10.607 --> 28:11.984
Midori Sour?

28:12.943 --> 28:15.696
- No, thanks.
- More for me.

28:18.282 --> 28:21.785
My last coming-out, I shared with this girl
who couldn't handle her booze.

28:21.869 --> 28:24.371
Neon-green puke all over her white dress.

28:24.454 --> 28:25.747
Your last coming-out?

28:25.831 --> 28:27.708
This is my fifth one this year.

28:27.791 --> 28:30.669
They say four out of five debs
marry their escorts.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.796
Kind of like the dentists with Trident.

28:32.838 --> 28:37.176
Five coming-out balls, five escorts.
One of them has to stick, right?

28:37.259 --> 28:40.304
- Good logic.
- So is your escort the one?

28:40.470 --> 28:42.639
- The one what?
- The one you're gonna marry.

28:42.723 --> 28:45.684
- Is he cute?
- Yes, he is very cute.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.145
- Where will you live when you marry?
- Hold on.

28:48.187 --> 28:51.398
Katie, hi. Too bad about your face.

28:51.481 --> 28:54.985
- Is it horrible?
- No, you can hardly tell.

28:55.194 --> 28:56.904
Just walk sideways.

28:57.404 --> 28:59.573
These things will be the death of me.

28:59.656 --> 29:02.117
I know. And we've had no time to prep.

29:02.201 --> 29:05.370
Jenna just got out of Rainbow Hills
two days ago.

29:05.871 --> 29:07.706
- Rehab?
- Fat farm.

29:09.208 --> 29:12.044
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.
Could you come with me?

29:12.127 --> 29:14.755
My cummerbund and I
aren't seeing eye to eye.

29:14.838 --> 29:17.382
Men. Totally helpless. Excuse me.

29:19.176 --> 29:22.721
You saved me. I love you.
I want to have your baby.

29:22.888 --> 29:25.015
- Too late.
- I saw the look.

29:25.098 --> 29:28.143
The same one you had that time
you ended up on homecoming court.

29:28.227 --> 29:30.729
Someone's idea of a sick, sick joke.

29:31.813 --> 29:35.400
By the way,
Neil Young's got nothing on you.

29:35.484 --> 29:36.944
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:37.569 --> 29:39.822
- Have you seen your father?
- No.

29:39.905 --> 29:41.740
He promised me he'd be here by now.

29:41.782 --> 29:44.660
- You didn't come together?
- I swear, if he misses this...

29:44.743 --> 29:47.162
- Did you call him?
- Of course I called him.

29:47.246 --> 29:49.206
I wouldn't go this long
without calling him.

29:49.289 --> 29:51.291
- Emily, he's here.
- Where?

29:53.210 --> 29:54.962
Where have you been?

29:58.131 --> 30:00.926
I can't look. Did she bean him
with the baby's breath?

30:00.968 --> 30:03.929
No, they're just energetically
practicing their sign language.

30:04.012 --> 30:05.264
Oh, God.

30:05.764 --> 30:08.559
Okay, I think this is a really good time
for a martini.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.727
Hello? Thirsty people here.

30:11.728 --> 30:14.314
- What are you doing?
- Steve won't mind.

30:14.398 --> 30:16.775
Little tip, never a good idea
to let people know...

30:16.859 --> 30:19.945
you're on a first-name basis
with the bartender.

30:20.445 --> 30:22.739
- This is really something.
- What?

30:22.781 --> 30:25.117
You and I together at a debutante ball.

30:25.159 --> 30:26.368
Yeah.

30:26.451 --> 30:28.579
Just like it would have been 16 years ago.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.831
- Fancy dress.
- Sneaking booze.

30:30.914 --> 30:33.625
- Parents acting crazy.
- You look great.

30:35.294 --> 30:37.963
- I'm so glad you're here.
- So am I.

30:39.131 --> 30:43.093
All fathers, please report
to the debutante staging area upstairs.

30:43.260 --> 30:45.137
Fathers, to the staging area.

30:45.220 --> 30:48.265
- Showtime. You gonna be all right?
- Absolutely.

30:51.310 --> 30:52.769
I'll see you later.

30:53.562 --> 30:54.813
Curtsy pretty.

30:58.317 --> 31:01.570
Just wanted to see you before
you became a proper lady of society.

31:01.653 --> 31:03.238
- What do you think?
- I think...

31:03.322 --> 31:06.366
- you look like a cotton ball.
- Why, thank you, Jeeves.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.619
But a really cute cotton ball.

31:08.660 --> 31:10.204
Oh, my God, is this your escort?

31:10.287 --> 31:13.332
- Yeah, it is.
- You are totally getting married.

31:16.168 --> 31:18.670
- What did she say?
- Well...

31:19.046 --> 31:20.672
Dad. Great, let's go.

31:20.756 --> 31:23.675
- I'll meet you downstairs. Good luck.
- Okay.

31:24.176 --> 31:26.470
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

31:26.512 --> 31:28.680
If everyone could please take their seat.

31:28.764 --> 31:30.682
We're about to get started with...

31:30.724 --> 31:32.935
Last chance
to shimmy down the drainpipe.

31:33.018 --> 31:34.645
- Do me a favor?
- Anything.

31:34.686 --> 31:37.231
- Just don't let me fall.
- Right back at you.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.861
Good evening.

31:42.945 --> 31:45.697
On behalf of the
Daughters of the American Revolution...

31:45.781 --> 31:49.910
I would like to welcome you
to our annual debutante ball.

31:50.202 --> 31:52.663
This brings back so many memories.

31:52.704 --> 31:56.041
I myself came out in this very hall in 19...

31:56.583 --> 31:59.503
Well, let's just say a number of years ago.

32:00.420 --> 32:04.675
Now, the word 'debutante'
comes from the French word 'débuter'...

32:04.716 --> 32:07.135
- You're being irrational.
... which means to lead off.

32:07.219 --> 32:10.347
- Just come sit down.
- I'm going to finish my drink.

32:10.389 --> 32:13.308
You won't be happy
until you've spoiled this evening.

32:13.392 --> 32:15.853
Guys, there's a lady up there with...

32:15.936 --> 32:20.357
a rock the size of Neptune, talking
about the debutantes of ancient Greece.

32:20.399 --> 32:24.194
It's a lot easier to fall asleep
if you're sitting down. Trust me.

32:24.236 --> 32:26.530
I will sit down
when I am ready to sit down.

32:26.572 --> 32:29.241
- Lower your voice.
- No, I will not lower my voice.

32:29.324 --> 32:32.703
I paid a fortune to be here,
and I will speak as loudly as I like.

32:32.744 --> 32:34.955
You're embarrassing us,
embarrassing Rory.

32:35.038 --> 32:38.041
This wasn't Rory's idea.
This was your idea.

32:38.167 --> 32:40.252
This ridiculous evening was your idea.

32:40.335 --> 32:42.254
You don't want her presented to society?

32:42.337 --> 32:44.882
To hell with society!
Yes, I'm talking about you!

32:44.965 --> 32:46.425
Come on, that's it.

32:47.092 --> 32:49.178
Are you two
completely out of your minds?

32:49.261 --> 32:51.096
There's a ceremony going on in there.

32:51.138 --> 32:54.224
Young girls in ugly dresses
and stupid fans are parading around...

32:54.308 --> 32:57.144
in circles for whatever reason,
and you two are ruining it.

32:57.227 --> 32:59.563
I didn't want to come here. You knew that.

32:59.605 --> 33:02.316
That's too bad.
We have a social responsibility.

33:02.399 --> 33:04.610
I am so tired of hearing you say that.

33:04.693 --> 33:07.905
People expect us to be certain places
and do certain things.

33:07.946 --> 33:09.865
We can't just withdraw from all that.

33:09.948 --> 33:11.658
You know what I'm going through
at work?

33:11.742 --> 33:14.411
Your whole life isn't that damn company.

33:14.453 --> 33:17.873
I have told you what I'm going through,
but you don't seem to hear it.

33:17.956 --> 33:20.000
You don't listen to me or anybody.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.793
- That is not true.
- It is.

33:21.835 --> 33:24.588
Isn't it true? Has she ever listened
to a word you've said?

33:24.630 --> 33:27.758
People listen in different ways.

33:27.799 --> 33:30.802
Right? Some people listen with their ears
and some people...

33:30.886 --> 33:32.346
listen with not their ears.

33:32.429 --> 33:36.099
But that doesn't mean some listening
hasn't happened in some form.

33:36.141 --> 33:39.520
I have listened to you, Richard.
I know exactly what is going on.

33:39.603 --> 33:41.063
Really? What?

33:41.146 --> 33:42.773
- You lost an account.
- What?

33:42.814 --> 33:46.360
No. I didn't lose an account.
I was taken off an account.

33:46.443 --> 33:50.823
I was taken off an account that I brought
into this company 10 years ago.

33:50.864 --> 33:52.366
There are other accounts.

33:52.449 --> 33:55.035
I have been in charge of that account
for 10 years!

33:55.118 --> 33:58.288
How can you be so angry?
Yes, they took you off that account...

33:58.330 --> 34:00.666
but they also gave you a promotion.

34:00.749 --> 34:02.292
You said they moved you upstairs...

34:02.334 --> 34:06.463
to a larger office and gave you a new title
and a better parking space.

34:06.505 --> 34:09.591
- Damn it. I am being phased out.
- You are not.

34:09.675 --> 34:14.054
I know whether I'm being phased out.
I invented 'phased out' for this company.

34:14.137 --> 34:17.056
Don't you think I did
the exact same thing to Allen Parker?

34:17.139 --> 34:20.351
- Allen Parker retired.
- Allen Parker was phased out.

34:20.393 --> 34:23.397
I now have his office.
I now have his parking space.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.190
You know what happens from here?

34:25.274 --> 34:28.318
I lose more accounts slowly, but surely.

34:28.694 --> 34:32.322
They will put a younger man on them
with me to be trained by the best.

34:32.364 --> 34:35.409
Then one day, they'll call and ask me...

34:35.492 --> 34:39.371
to let that young man take a meeting
without me, to see how fast he's learning.

34:39.454 --> 34:43.000
And then, suddenly,
that young man is given that account.

34:43.333 --> 34:46.210
And this happens
again and again and again...

34:46.253 --> 34:49.755
until I am nothing
but a symbolic figurehead...

34:49.840 --> 34:52.842
that they roll out for banquets
and group pictures.

34:52.885 --> 34:55.012
And then, one day, Emily...

34:55.804 --> 34:57.848
I will be asked to leave.

35:01.059 --> 35:02.519
Well, so what?

35:03.270 --> 35:04.521
Excuse me?

35:04.563 --> 35:07.566
- I don't think Mom meant exactly...
- So what if that's true?

35:07.608 --> 35:09.985
- Or maybe she did.
- There are other options.

35:10.068 --> 35:12.154
I don't want other options.

35:12.237 --> 35:14.656
I want to get up every morning
and put on my suit...

35:14.740 --> 35:18.577
and go to my office and do my work,
like I've done every day for 30 years.

35:18.660 --> 35:21.580
That's what I want to do.
That's the only thing I want to do.

35:21.622 --> 35:24.917
Excuse me. Hi.
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm next.

35:31.173 --> 35:32.716
Elizabeth Doty.

35:32.966 --> 35:37.513
Daughter of George Edward Doty IV
and Eleanor Doty.

35:43.185 --> 35:44.937
Lorelai Gilmore.

35:45.187 --> 35:49.233
Daughter of Christopher Hayden
and Lorelai Gilmore.

36:23.642 --> 36:26.144
That should have been you up there.

36:26.895 --> 36:30.065
Nothing's turning out the way
it was supposed to.

36:46.790 --> 36:49.293
Did you know
that you're considered a hot dad?

36:49.334 --> 36:50.377
Really?

36:50.460 --> 36:52.629
Libby said it's too bad you're my real dad.

36:52.671 --> 36:55.591
If you were my step-dad,
I could steal you away from Mom.

36:55.674 --> 36:57.593
Libby's got a good life ahead of her.

36:57.676 --> 36:59.386
I was very proud of all of you.

36:59.469 --> 37:02.472
You made it through the entire ceremony
with a straight face.

37:02.556 --> 37:03.849
Almost all of you.

37:03.932 --> 37:06.852
I'm sorry, but that fan dance
was more than I could take.

37:06.894 --> 37:09.146
- I need burger.
- Me, too. Dean?

37:09.188 --> 37:12.357
The only thing I can think of
is taking off this tux.

37:12.441 --> 37:14.818
Watch it. You're talking to a lady now.

37:14.860 --> 37:17.488
- How about if I do it at home?
- Better.

37:17.654 --> 37:21.325
- Thanks again for going with me.
- Tomorrow, you start paying.

37:21.366 --> 37:22.743
- Bye.
- Bye.

37:23.535 --> 37:24.953
And then there were three.

37:25.037 --> 37:27.456
I have to get back to Boston
in the morning...

37:27.539 --> 37:29.374
so I'm gonna call it a night, too.

37:29.458 --> 37:31.210
What? Not even time for fries?

37:31.293 --> 37:34.671
I'll get up a little early
and have coffee with you before I go.

37:34.713 --> 37:36.215
- Deal?
- Deal.

37:37.049 --> 37:40.219
Go ahead and order for us.
I'll be there in a sec.

37:43.096 --> 37:46.308
I just wanted to tell you
how amazing you were tonight.

37:46.391 --> 37:48.810
Really, you completely came through
for her.

37:48.894 --> 37:50.354
She deserves it.

37:50.395 --> 37:52.981
I haven't always given you
a lot of credit in the past...

37:53.065 --> 37:55.567
but I'm giving you credit now. Big credit.

37:55.651 --> 37:58.904
- Major credit. Buy yourself a sofa.
- Thanks. I will.

37:59.571 --> 38:00.906
You know...

38:01.448 --> 38:05.786
I happened to be looking through
some old maps this afternoon...

38:05.869 --> 38:10.165
and I couldn't help but notice
that Boston is not that far away.

38:10.541 --> 38:12.584
You needed a map to tell you that?

38:12.668 --> 38:16.964
I also noticed that that I-84
is a very good road.

38:17.047 --> 38:18.423
Solid, paved.

38:18.507 --> 38:21.218
I put this information
in my pretty little head.

38:21.260 --> 38:25.222
I was thinking, if you wanted to
maybe drop by occasionally...

38:25.264 --> 38:26.640
it wouldn't be too difficult.

38:26.723 --> 38:29.601
You realize I'll be driving the Volvo?

38:30.102 --> 38:32.354
Actually, I'm coming around to the Volvo.

38:32.437 --> 38:34.606
- Really?
- Yes.

38:34.982 --> 38:38.152
I think it's sort of
a Catholic schoolgirl thing.

38:38.235 --> 38:42.614
You know, it's conservative
on the outside, bad on the inside.

38:42.698 --> 38:44.408
I like that image.

38:48.704 --> 38:52.249
I've also heard the I-84
can get jammed on weekends.

38:52.291 --> 38:53.625
It can.

38:53.709 --> 38:58.005
So if you wanted to stay a little longer,
just to avoid the traffic...

38:58.505 --> 39:00.090
it might be a good idea.

39:00.174 --> 39:02.968
I mean, Rory would definitely love it.

39:04.219 --> 39:06.138
And I wouldn't mind, either.

39:06.930 --> 39:10.434
That is a tempting offer,
but I really have to get back.

39:11.977 --> 39:14.021
- To work?
- To work...

39:15.522 --> 39:17.608
and to someone.

39:20.986 --> 39:22.613
I know, I should have told you.

39:22.696 --> 39:26.158
- That's fine. It's totally your business.
- I meant to, but...

39:28.035 --> 39:30.037
It's just that you and I are so connected...

39:30.120 --> 39:32.122
Chris, please. I get it.

39:32.414 --> 39:35.709
- I think it's really great. I really do.
- Thank you.

39:36.376 --> 39:38.295
So, who is it? Let me guess.

39:38.337 --> 39:40.297
Linda from marketing got to you.

39:40.339 --> 39:42.341
- Her name is Sherrie.
- Sherrie from marketing?

39:42.424 --> 39:45.093
- Sherrie from Boston.
- Hence the move.

39:45.177 --> 39:47.638
- Is it serious?
- It's getting there.

39:47.763 --> 39:49.932
'Seeing you in just a bow tie' serious?

39:50.015 --> 39:51.850
We're living together.

39:53.310 --> 39:54.770
You really have changed.

39:54.853 --> 39:59.191
Sherrie made it clear I was gonna lose her
if I didn't start getting it together.

39:59.233 --> 40:02.653
If you find a girl who's good
with dating a square in a Volvo...

40:02.694 --> 40:04.905
you do what it takes to keep her.

40:07.866 --> 40:10.828
So I'll see you back home.

40:11.119 --> 40:12.454
Yes, you will.

40:35.394 --> 40:36.520
What?

40:36.562 --> 40:41.233
After all you've been through tonight,
I come in and find you eating like that?

40:43.110 --> 40:45.529
- There you go.
- Being a lady is hard.

40:45.571 --> 40:48.240
So, tonight? What's the consensus?

40:48.699 --> 40:52.161
The fan dance was humiliating.
I'm never doing a curtsy again.

40:52.244 --> 40:53.996
But having Dad around was great.

40:54.079 --> 40:56.665
- Yeah, it was.
- He's got a new girlfriend.

40:56.748 --> 40:58.167
- Sherrie.
- Yeah.

40:58.250 --> 41:00.919
Poor girI's named after a Journey song.
That's rough.

41:01.003 --> 41:04.548
- He seems happy.
- He does. He really does.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.425
- I'm glad.
- Me, too.

41:06.508 --> 41:08.760
I feel kind of bad for Grandma, though.

41:08.802 --> 41:11.763
She was so into this night,
and she ended up being so miserable.

41:11.847 --> 41:14.308
Don't worry.
She'll have more fun at the next one.

41:14.391 --> 41:15.517
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

41:15.601 --> 41:17.895
We have you signed up
for the next six balls.

41:17.936 --> 41:19.771
- Not funny.
- You're doing this...

41:19.855 --> 41:22.608
- till you bring home a prize.
- Ignoring you now.

41:24.776 --> 41:26.111
Back from the ball?

41:26.195 --> 41:28.780
I left behind a glass slipper
and a business card...

41:28.864 --> 41:30.657
in case the prince is really dumb.

41:30.741 --> 41:32.868
Good and desperate thinking.

41:33.118 --> 41:35.913
- Thank you. Luke.
- What?

41:42.377 --> 41:44.046
What do you think you're doing?

41:44.129 --> 41:46.048
- Working.
- So you think this is funny?

41:46.131 --> 41:48.258
I'm sorry, I thought this was the uniform.

41:48.342 --> 41:51.595
You know what?
That's fine. Have your little joke.

41:51.637 --> 41:52.763
Doesn't bother me at all.

41:52.804 --> 41:56.767
You just go over there and clean off
that table. I'm ignoring you.

41:56.808 --> 41:59.102
- You do not exist.
- Okay.

42:05.776 --> 42:09.446
- That's it. Get upstairs and change.
- Whatever you say, Uncle Luke.

42:09.488 --> 42:13.116
It's Luke. Just Luke. Mr. Luke.

42:13.158 --> 42:15.452
In fact, don't address me at all!

42:15.494 --> 42:18.956
- You know, I'm really lucky.
- Yeah? Why?

42:18.997 --> 42:22.960
I have someone to complain to
when life sucks or work sucks...

42:23.043 --> 42:26.296
or just everything sucks,
I have someone I can talk to.

42:26.338 --> 42:29.007
- Yeah? Who?
- Shecky, you kill me.

42:29.925 --> 42:32.135
It must be really lonely not to have that.

42:32.177 --> 42:34.012
You thinking about Grandma?

42:34.263 --> 42:36.807
I'm just thinking.

42:46.024 --> 42:47.276
Hey, Mom.

42:48.110 --> 42:50.237
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing much.

42:50.320 --> 42:53.448
I had a little time
before my business class, and I thought:

42:53.532 --> 42:57.035
'Hey, why don't I go over to Mom's house
and just hang?'

42:57.369 --> 42:58.954
- Just what?
- Just hang.

42:59.037 --> 43:02.166
You know, hang out, talk,
don't talk, whatever.

43:02.249 --> 43:03.584
Just hang.

43:05.669 --> 43:07.838
- You're gardening, huh?
- Yes.

43:08.172 --> 43:12.676
Okay, well, don't let me stop you.
I'll just sit here...

43:13.677 --> 43:15.012
and just hang.

43:15.053 --> 43:17.055
Are you sure you don't need something?

43:17.139 --> 43:19.266
Nope. I'm just here to hang.

43:22.519 --> 43:23.604
Well.

43:26.815 --> 43:30.819
Mom, if there's ever anything
you want to talk about with me, you can.

43:32.863 --> 43:34.198
All right.

43:35.491 --> 43:36.575
Okay.

43:38.577 --> 43:39.578
So...

44:23.956 --> 44:24.998
