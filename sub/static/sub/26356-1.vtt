00:54.640 --> 00:55.679
Joanna...

00:59.560 --> 01:00.640
Joanna, did you do it?

01:28.640 --> 01:31.860
Of all the things that can happen to
a person...

01:36.440 --> 01:38.960
...there's few things that could be
worse.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.879
Can you think of any?

01:50.439 --> 01:51.479
There are none.

01:56.166 --> 01:57.326
And the whole world...

01:58.920 --> 02:01.839
...they want to look at someone who
that has happened to.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.980
Everyone just wants to look at you.

02:05.160 --> 02:09.500
Everyone wants to judge you,
stare at you...

02:11.200 --> 02:15.140
...look for clues, so maybe it won't
happen to them.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.639
That's when this began.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.300
Two faces.

02:32.133 --> 02:33.173
Two Joannas.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.240
Justice for Noah!

04:25.800 --> 04:26.840
Jo.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.100
Jo, please.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.240
Jo?

05:00.280 --> 05:01.319
Jo.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.399
Mm?

05:02.400 --> 05:04.020
Go to bed.

05:16.519 --> 05:17.559
Bye.

05:17.959 --> 05:18.999
Bye.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.359
The minister will speak for two minutes.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.719
He'll take four questions,
less if off-topic.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.399
Alistair. Henry McCallum, I was
wondering if you would care to

05:43.400 --> 05:47.660
respond to the article I wrote about
the Minister's recent indiscretions?

05:48.320 --> 05:51.279
I deal with the true press,
not with clicktivists.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.559
LAUGHTER Welcome to the new world.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.719
Would you agree that the party
faithful has a right to be informed

05:56.720 --> 05:59.860
if one of its executive members is
being dishonest?

06:02.840 --> 06:06.559
Henry, I... I'd love to have a chat
with you but this is not my stage.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.993
Just keeping it warm.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.839
Morning, ladies and gents.

06:16.880 --> 06:20.759
Our changes to the welfare system
have improved the lives of...

06:22.080 --> 06:23.839
I'm at the end of my tether, here.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.159
Jo, sweetheart.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.639
You know what today is.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.919
There, there is no way that I can
come home right now.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.559
Well, you could come home if the
house was on fire,

06:31.560 --> 06:33.799
- or if I'd been robbed or murdered.
- I'm sorry.

06:33.800 --> 06:36.639
Can you ring the, the health
visitor? She could pop by...

06:37.680 --> 06:39.279
Er, no, no, it's all right.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.319
I'll be OK.

06:42.480 --> 06:43.519
Oh, God...

06:44.560 --> 06:47.279
God, this makes teaching a classroom
of five-year-olds look like a

06:47.280 --> 06:49.599
walk in the park. I had a lunch
hour alone!

06:49.600 --> 06:51.039
I've got to go, I'm sorry.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.479
All right. OK. Go be important.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.980
OK, are you listening?

07:19.080 --> 07:22.079
We have to stay very, very, very
quietly until they're

07:22.080 --> 07:23.120
ready for us, OK?

07:24.240 --> 07:25.759
Hi.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.879
You, you must be Miss Lyndsay.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.759
Joanna, Joanna Lyndsay, yeah.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.440
- Alistair Robertson.
- Hi.

07:32.600 --> 07:36.319
There's a guy in there, my boss,
he just loves reading stories.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.119
He has to read one once a day at
least or he gets, like,

07:39.120 --> 07:40.519
really cranky.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.999
Are you guys cool if you come in
and he reads a story to you?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.359
Yes.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.820
Yeah? OK, go for it.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.740
They're completely gorgeous.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.119
- How'd we do?
- Good.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.679
Lots of interest.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.380
And performance?

09:25.360 --> 09:27.639
Keep your hands on the lectern.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.039
I thought I did?

09:29.040 --> 09:30.399
They waved about a bit.

09:30.400 --> 09:34.439
Sort of, up, down, touching your tie.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.159
Just hold on.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.239
OK.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.700
Thanks.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.020
So, have you...?

09:43.440 --> 09:46.240
Have you given any thought to my
daughter's situation?

09:49.679 --> 09:50.719
I have.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.799
There's no way of keeping this
out of the press,

09:54.800 --> 09:56.639
so it's about how we manage it.

09:56.640 --> 10:00.599
What has happened to your daughter
could happen to any family.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.959
We have four weeks until the
charges are made public.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.519
A lifetime.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.720
I have a strategy.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.119
There's no covering this up.

10:17.120 --> 10:22.100
But, if we set the agenda, and shape
the story the way we want,

10:23.060 --> 10:25.120
we'll be in a much better position
to manage it.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.319
Families are fragile things.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.479
One wrong move, one bad decision and
all our lives are changed,

10:33.480 --> 10:35.080
like that. HE SNAPS HIS FINGERS

10:59.360 --> 11:00.399
Joanna?

11:10.360 --> 11:11.400
It's OK.

11:12.920 --> 11:13.959
Hello.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.040
You're OK.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.319
Where is he?

11:31.320 --> 11:32.980
It's OK. He's here.

11:36.880 --> 11:37.920
I fell asleep.

11:39.520 --> 11:40.560
He was crying.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.759
Yeah, he does that.

11:43.760 --> 11:44.799
Quite a bit.

11:45.840 --> 11:46.880
OK...

11:48.080 --> 11:49.120
There...

11:53.560 --> 11:54.599
I know.

11:57.320 --> 11:58.360
Come here.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.839
Did you pick up the passports?

12:09.160 --> 12:10.200
Um...

12:11.440 --> 12:12.900
No, it was cold.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.119
I'll get it tomorrow.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.159
Well, it's only a couple of stops on
the bus.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.200
I know.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.039
I'll get it together tomorrow.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.519
- Shh...
- I'm sure you'll be fine.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.560
I know.

12:28.600 --> 12:33.460
I see women out with their babies,
walking around like it's nothing.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.320
I never even saw them before Noah.

12:39.040 --> 12:42.599
Now I look at them like they're
marathon runners.

12:42.600 --> 12:46.620
I just want to yell out at them,
"You're amazing!"

12:50.040 --> 12:51.080
You're amazing.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.479
Hello.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.520
Hi.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.879
Sorry, have you forgotten something?

13:12.880 --> 13:14.439
I... You know, I did.

13:14.440 --> 13:15.919
I actually...

13:15.920 --> 13:18.780
...I totally forgot to get your phone
number.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.020
- Is this really necessary?
- Yes.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.759
"An application to regain full
custody demands substantial

13:31.760 --> 13:35.580
"evidence as to the stability of the
child's home environment."

13:37.200 --> 13:39.079
The mother has all the rights.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.759
The father has none.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.919
I want my daughter to know who I am.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.559
I want to be able to share some part
of her childhood

13:45.560 --> 13:46.680
before it's too late.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.900
Alexandra won't want to give up her
daughter.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.559
Alexandra took her.

13:53.560 --> 13:58.319
She took Chloe from this house and I
can't just go and take her back.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.360
I...

14:00.440 --> 14:02.200
We have to go through this process.

14:03.760 --> 14:08.279
And yes, it may be painful and
Australia is a long way away,

14:08.280 --> 14:11.900
but I can't not do it.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.519
You understand.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.119
Don't you?

14:18.120 --> 14:19.759
Yeah.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.840
Yeah, of course.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.934
As the court appointed
psychiatrist, I ask questions

14:31.935 --> 14:35.479
and you answer them as honestly as
you can, there are no right

14:35.480 --> 14:39.340
and no wrong answers, so relax.

14:41.920 --> 14:42.960
OK.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.920
I'd like you to think back to
when Noah was born.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.560
Can you tell me about that time?

14:53.040 --> 14:56.199
Hm, it's a bit of a blur.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.240
Do you remember it being a happy time?

15:00.120 --> 15:01.639
Yeah.

15:01.640 --> 15:02.680
Yeah, sure.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.639
A new baby can be overwhelming.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.240
People cope in different ways.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.520
Do you remember those days?

15:23.080 --> 15:24.359
Joanna?

15:24.360 --> 15:26.759
Jane, from mother's group.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.759
Yeah! Er... Hi, how are you?

15:29.760 --> 15:31.479
Great. How are you?

15:31.480 --> 15:33.679
Yeah, great. Good, thank you.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.140
Wow, he's really wrapped up.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.039
Plus a hat.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.519
How many layers have you got him in,
there? Is he not hot?

15:40.520 --> 15:41.560
Oh, he, um...

15:42.720 --> 15:43.960
He feels the cold.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.479
We haven't seen you for a few weeks.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.599
Yeah, I've been busy.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.319
Um, I, I, er...

15:51.320 --> 15:53.119
I better get going.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.620
Bye. Bye.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.840
Hello?

16:03.320 --> 16:05.020
I got your number from Liz.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.100
I know you'll all be here soon.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.199
Chloe's so excited to meet her brother.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.900
- Half-brother.
- Alex?

16:14.760 --> 16:16.400
I'll get to the point.

16:16.780 --> 16:20.640
I don't have enough money to fight
Alistair in the court system.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.199
But I can't lose my daughter.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.759
I won't.

16:25.760 --> 16:30.079
Alex, you took Chloe. Alistair
hasn't seen her in years.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.039
Yes. Yeah, we all know why I left
Scotland.

16:33.040 --> 16:36.300
And I, and I took my daughter
because I'm her mother.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.620
Alex, what do you want?

16:41.840 --> 16:45.679
I thought, now that you've had a baby,

16:45.680 --> 16:48.700
and congratulations on that, by the way,

16:49.580 --> 16:52.879
that you'd understand why I left and
why I had to

16:52.880 --> 16:54.940
take my daughter with me.

16:58.400 --> 17:03.820
I mean, can you imagine having your
child taken from you?

17:04.819 --> 17:06.878
Having to give him up?

17:06.880 --> 17:11.440
I know he's only a baby but trust
me, that bond only gets stronger.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.319
- Where is he from?
- He's Australian.

17:16.319 --> 17:17.800
He's Australian!

17:21.400 --> 17:24.398
- And you're sure that he's not married?
- He's not married.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.439
He isn't married!

17:25.440 --> 17:26.999
No! For God's sake.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.398
He's not married!

17:28.400 --> 17:29.439
He's...

17:40.560 --> 17:42.200
I'm going to his house tomorrow.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.280
I insisted.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.359
Oh, he's wearing my bib!

17:48.360 --> 17:49.799
Yeah.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.359
It's his going-out bib.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.839
Very cute.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.319
Can I get a latte and a turkey
salad, please?

17:56.320 --> 17:57.959
God, I'm eating cake.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.159
Looks nice.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.719
So, news. Booked.

18:00.720 --> 18:01.919
We're going.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.359
Wow, that's wonderful.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.359
Well, 24 hours on a flight with this
one first.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.079
I'm sure you'll get through it. Oh,
and it's summer in Australia!

18:08.080 --> 18:09.999
And you'll have Granny to look after
the baby.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.519
Yeah, well, it's not just a holiday.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.400
Alistair is trying to get Chloe back.

18:15.880 --> 18:18.199
To come and live here? With you?

18:18.200 --> 18:20.319
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.079
And is that what you want?

18:22.080 --> 18:23.319
What?

18:23.320 --> 18:26.360
Well, to become a step-mother to
a teenage girl?

18:28.600 --> 18:30.120
Do I have a choice?

18:34.040 --> 18:35.399
How old is she?

18:35.400 --> 18:36.919
Chloe is 14.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.879
- Oof...
- What?

18:40.040 --> 18:42.079
Just remembering what I was like at 14.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.719
Yeah, well, I'm the dreaded step-mother.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.199
I'm sorry.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.719
Can I, can I get that to go?

18:51.720 --> 18:53.120
I've really got to get back.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.319
You could always come to the
salon if you want?

18:57.320 --> 18:59.060
No, no, no. No, you, you go.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.640
We've got some things to pick up.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.320
He's so adorable.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.340
He's not a puppy.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.780
Oh, God, sorry.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.879
Tired.

19:17.880 --> 19:21.399
I don't think I've had more than two
hours' sleep for weeks.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.439
Really? Doesn't Alistair get up
sometimes?

19:23.440 --> 19:24.519
Mm, he's working.

19:24.520 --> 19:26.679
He needs the sleep. Anyway, I have
the boobs.

19:26.680 --> 19:27.959
But you have to sleep, too.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.279
You know, this is work.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.879
Mm, he earns the money, he wears the
ear plugs.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.319
That doesn't seem fair.

19:33.320 --> 19:36.239
Look, I really have to go.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.640
Bye. Bye.

19:38.800 --> 19:39.840
Say "bye!"

20:21.640 --> 20:23.559
This is the hallway. There's the
piano there,

20:23.560 --> 20:24.919
- I play that all the time.
- OK.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.479
And this...

20:26.480 --> 20:27.759
This is the bedroom.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.800
Mm-hmm.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.440
I...

20:33.720 --> 20:36.079
I only have 25 minutes.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.120
Me too.

20:52.920 --> 20:53.960
Chloe!

21:09.240 --> 21:11.479
Well, the pool was closed,

21:11.480 --> 21:12.720
and we didn't know.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.399
For cleaning.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.440
Alex!

21:26.160 --> 21:27.360
Do you want to get dry?

21:28.400 --> 21:29.440
Let's get dry.

21:58.920 --> 21:59.960
Oh, I forgot...

22:02.160 --> 22:03.319
Can I help?

22:03.320 --> 22:05.039
Uh... No.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.440
I'm all right, thanks.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.399
Are you sure you're OK?

22:09.400 --> 22:11.279
You seem a bit out of sorts.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.599
I'm about to take a new born on a
30-hour flight,

22:13.600 --> 22:16.919
and my back is giving me grief again.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.239
Am I allowed to be slightly ruffled?

22:19.240 --> 22:22.639
Just, stop asking me if I'm OK all
of the time.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.240
OK! Let's skedaddle.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.959
Come here.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.100
Come here. Good boy.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.080
We'll get through it.

22:46.720 --> 22:48.519
See you soon. Safe travels.

22:48.520 --> 22:49.900
Bye, Alistair.

22:54.680 --> 22:57.039
Yes, I was with them the day they left.

22:57.040 --> 23:00.360
Would you say Joanna was looking
forward to her trip to Australia?

23:01.760 --> 23:02.919
Yes.

23:02.920 --> 23:06.620
Relaxed? Happy? In control?

23:07.480 --> 23:08.520
Yes.

23:09.920 --> 23:14.079
The passenger statements we've heard
here today paint a very

23:14.080 --> 23:15.720
different picture, don't they?

23:17.200 --> 23:20.279
Joanna was looking forward to
going to Australia,

23:20.280 --> 23:23.639
nobody looks forward to flying all
that way with a new baby.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.820
Least of all the other passengers.

23:27.200 --> 23:30.959
You see, I find it odd that your
memory of Joanna and Alistair

23:30.960 --> 23:34.999
at this time is so different from
the psychiatrist's report.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.519
How do you account for that?

23:36.520 --> 23:38.399
I'm not a doctor.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.760
I wasn't looking for problems.

23:41.100 --> 23:44.639
Life isn't always easy and having a
new baby

23:44.640 --> 23:47.220
is certainly testing, but Joanna?

23:48.880 --> 23:50.240
She was amazing.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.920
No more questions, my lord.

24:04.960 --> 24:05.999
Shh...

24:22.440 --> 24:23.960
Please, shut up...

24:28.120 --> 24:29.359
Shut up...

24:40.040 --> 24:41.440
Try feeding the poor thing.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.120
Shh...

24:59.880 --> 25:01.039
Please stop.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.159
Oh, no. Please stop.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.439
Please stop.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.439
Al?

25:29.440 --> 25:30.480
Al!

25:33.480 --> 25:35.800
I came as quickly as I could,
are you all right?

25:44.240 --> 25:46.700
I came back from work and they were gone.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.680
I rang the police, the airport, but...

25:53.446 --> 25:55.446
_

25:55.720 --> 25:57.239
Can... Can she just take her?

25:57.240 --> 25:59.100
I don't know. I don't know.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.640
But she's gone.

26:05.320 --> 26:06.740
Jo, I'm sorry.

26:14.360 --> 26:18.039
My m... my marriage... It was over,

26:18.040 --> 26:21.999
it was over long ago, but when you
have a child,

26:22.000 --> 26:23.680
leaving is just...

26:26.200 --> 26:27.860
It's huge.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.120
I fell in love with you,

26:42.533 --> 26:44.093
and that is no lie.

27:12.680 --> 27:13.720
Hi.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.439
Bubs not settling?

27:17.440 --> 27:19.639
No, sorry. I'm sorry.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.679
There's been a number of complaints.

27:23.720 --> 27:25.919
Is there something you can do to
stop him crying?

27:25.920 --> 27:27.639
Passengers are trying to sleep.

27:27.640 --> 27:28.679
Yeah.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.159
Have you got a bottle or something?

27:30.160 --> 27:32.399
Look, I'm not doing this on
purpose, believe me.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.200
Try giving it some scotch.

27:35.385 --> 27:38.119
Was it you, smart-mouth, who made
the complaint?

27:38.120 --> 27:40.919
With nothing to do but sit and read
for the next 12 hours?

27:40.920 --> 27:42.679
Would you like to have a go?

27:42.680 --> 27:45.239
Please... Would you like to take him
and have a go?

27:45.240 --> 27:48.159
If there is anybody, anybody here
who thinks they can help me out,

27:48.160 --> 27:50.439
I would be more than fucking grateful,

27:50.440 --> 27:52.119
you bunch of stuck-up arse wipes!

27:52.120 --> 27:53.240
Jo... Jo!

27:58.920 --> 28:03.719
I have the health visitor's notes
from your postnatal visits here.

28:03.720 --> 28:07.079
A health visitor? No, I don't
remember seeing anybody.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.479
You attended three appointments at
the baby health clinic

28:09.480 --> 28:10.799
at the Royal Infirmary.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.959
Oh, that? Yeah. They, they measured
him and weighed him.

28:13.960 --> 28:14.999
Yeah.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.039
These are copies of the postnatal
screening questions.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.360
Is that your handwriting and
your signature?

28:22.640 --> 28:23.679
Yes.

28:23.680 --> 28:26.159
There's nothing in your responses
which would indicate

28:26.160 --> 28:27.560
the feelings of not coping.

28:29.320 --> 28:30.799
All the other mums looked happy.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.994
I couldn't walk in there
and say "I'm sorry,

28:34.594 --> 28:36.780
"I don't think I'm very good at this."

28:38.960 --> 28:40.759
I thought everyone just ticked the boxes.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.999
So, you would say that you weren't
coping?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.500
I suppose not.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.560
I don't know.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.679
Did you ever have thoughts of
wanting to escape?

28:53.680 --> 28:55.180
SHE SCOFFS Yes!

28:56.440 --> 28:57.480
Yes.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.520
Doesn't everyone?

29:04.760 --> 29:06.199
Could we have some water, please?

29:06.200 --> 29:07.239
Thank you.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.520
Shh, shh...

29:11.120 --> 29:12.399
I'm getting you some water.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.920
Why would somebody complain?

29:15.360 --> 29:16.719
People are so horrible.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.159
I'm sorry. I should have woken up.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.679
I can sleep through anything.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.639
- How's your back?
- Awful.

29:23.640 --> 29:24.680
Shh, shh, shh...

29:26.000 --> 29:27.040
Here.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.440
There you go.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.759
Thank you so much.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.359
Can we also... Can we get this
heated up, please?

29:34.360 --> 29:35.520
- No problem.
- Thank you.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.079
All right.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.359
Now, get some sleep, OK?

29:48.360 --> 29:49.400
OK.

29:58.200 --> 30:01.279
Did you feel that you were
adequately supported?

30:01.280 --> 30:02.919
What do you mean?

30:02.920 --> 30:06.620
Your fiance? Family, neighbours, friends?

30:10.680 --> 30:12.039
I, I didn't know what to do.

30:12.040 --> 30:13.600
I had no-one to show me.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.759
Your mother died when you were...?

30:17.760 --> 30:19.120
Er, 15.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.320
Um, and Alistair's mother, she was
on the other side of the world.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.340
Ancient history.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.000
Shh...

30:39.480 --> 30:41.600
Would you like me to take him for a bit?

30:46.680 --> 30:48.199
Yeah, er...

30:48.200 --> 30:49.759
Thank you so much.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.800
You need a break.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.119
Right, come on, my sweetheart. That's it.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.660
Careful now.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.239
Thank you.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.279
Sorry.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.159
Yes... Shh.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.280
It's all right.

31:13.280 --> 31:14.479
I think he's teething.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.600
I think you're right.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.479
There we go.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.880
There we are.

31:22.440 --> 31:23.660
Ah...

31:27.400 --> 31:28.440
Shh...

31:34.080 --> 31:35.279
Hello.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.440
Welcome to Melbourne.

31:40.560 --> 31:41.599
Is he OK?

31:41.600 --> 31:42.640
He's good.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.399
It's over.

31:46.400 --> 31:49.240
They wanted to wake you for
breakfast but I let you sleep.

31:50.920 --> 31:52.880
- Nicked this for you though.
- Thank you.

32:03.560 --> 32:04.940
Ah, shite...

32:05.800 --> 32:07.319
What is it?

32:07.320 --> 32:08.940
I need a coffee.

32:10.280 --> 32:11.360
I'll get us one.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.279
I forgot how shitty jet lag feels.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.479
You slept almost the whole way.

32:17.480 --> 32:20.039
Jet lag's not caused by lack of sleep.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.560
You know that, right?

32:53.680 --> 32:54.720
Mum!

32:56.040 --> 32:57.080
Yep.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.120
Hi.

33:02.760 --> 33:03.940
How was your day?

33:08.080 --> 33:09.420
What did you do today?

33:10.200 --> 33:11.919
School work, Mum.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.679
Boring, stupid school work.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.999
Your counsellor thinks it's a good idea.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.519
Just stick with it.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.799
None of my friends are there.

33:20.800 --> 33:23.599
OK? No-one else has to do this
in the holidays.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.079
Chlo...

33:25.080 --> 33:27.799
You are on such thin ice at school,

33:27.800 --> 33:30.959
and if you get expelled, if you
are... Listen.

33:30.960 --> 33:32.119
Trust me.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.559
It's going to be really bad
for your life.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.879
There are no other schools in this area.

33:36.880 --> 33:39.120
You'd be lucky to get a job in a shop.

33:50.080 --> 33:53.399
Sometimes you have to do things
you don't want to do, Chloe.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.260
Excuse me?

33:57.240 --> 33:58.999
You know, that's just... That's life.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.359
Yeah, your life.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.599
Yeah, could you not be rude to me,
please?

34:02.600 --> 34:04.440
I'm dealing with a lot at the moment.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.560
I'm not going, Mum.

34:10.920 --> 34:14.399
I don't care if the court tells me
to, I'm not going to live

34:14.400 --> 34:15.719
in horrible Scotland.

34:17.639 --> 34:18.860
They can't make me go...

34:20.880 --> 34:21.920
...can they?

34:23.800 --> 34:25.560
Not if I have anything to do with it.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.319
I was thinking about that day.

34:34.320 --> 34:37.399
The day that they walked in on us in
the apartment.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.440
What?

34:41.639 --> 34:43.500
Why did you take me to your home?

34:45.560 --> 34:47.478
It was such a dangerous thing to do.

34:47.480 --> 34:51.239
I could have... I could have seen
one of Chloe's toys

34:51.239 --> 34:54.199
or Alexandra's clothes or gone in to
the bathroom

34:54.199 --> 34:56.478
and seen that a woman had lived there.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.319
And...?

34:58.320 --> 35:00.919
And you're just thinking about this now?

35:00.920 --> 35:01.960
Yeah.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.999
Can you remember what you were thinking?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.040
Um...

35:14.800 --> 35:16.760
I was thinking I could get away with it.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.239
That's it, well done, Joanna!

35:27.240 --> 35:29.879
That's your baby's head forward, Joanna.

35:29.880 --> 35:30.919
Well done!

35:33.480 --> 35:34.519
Good, good, good!

35:36.600 --> 35:37.640
Well done.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.359
Hey! Hi.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.719
Oh, that looks delicious!

36:27.720 --> 36:29.679
Thanks. Made it myself.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.220
Clever girl!

36:32.000 --> 36:34.079
How are you? Do you want to come in
for a cup of tea?

36:34.080 --> 36:36.639
They're not here. They're going to
go straight to the cottage,

36:36.640 --> 36:38.195
change and unpack before they come here.

36:38.220 --> 36:39.319
Mrs Wilson's?

36:39.320 --> 36:41.479
Are they not staying here?

36:41.480 --> 36:44.079
No. They wanted a place of their
own, you know.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.599
It's their holiday.

36:45.600 --> 36:46.640
Tea?

36:47.800 --> 36:49.279
I'm just going to push off.

36:49.280 --> 36:51.719
I've got a bit of running around
to do this afternoon.

36:51.720 --> 36:53.680
I'm going to come and pick you up later.

36:57.120 --> 37:00.399
Chloe, can you just run inside so I
can have a talk to your nan?

37:00.400 --> 37:01.599
About me?

37:01.600 --> 37:02.799
Not necessarily.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.239
Why can't I stay?

37:04.240 --> 37:06.799
I should be able to hear what
you say about me.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.599
Do as your mum says.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.320
And keep an ear out for the phone in
case your dad calls.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.580
I wish I had that power.

37:19.800 --> 37:25.820
I'm not sure if you're aware that
Alistair wants custody of Chloe.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.360
He's hired lawyers.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.200
I'm sorry if I'm telling you
things you already know.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.679
Sorry. I'll, er...

37:40.680 --> 37:41.940
...get going.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.679
Alex.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.760
He did tell me.

37:47.880 --> 37:50.759
I just think with all the trouble
that she's having at school

37:50.760 --> 37:51.999
- at the moment...
- She's 14.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.279
I was 14 once.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.919
I certainly didn't hit my teachers.

37:55.920 --> 37:59.440
I just think a change would be good
for her.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.159
She's my daughter.

38:03.160 --> 38:04.320
My only child.

38:06.120 --> 38:08.700
I won't hand her to another
woman to be raised.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.639
You know if he wins, she'll be
living in Scotland

38:17.640 --> 38:19.720
and you won't see her any
more than I will.

38:31.800 --> 38:32.840
No bars at all.

38:34.760 --> 38:37.039
Maybe if you see a hill or something.

38:37.040 --> 38:40.079
You know, you'll be more like a big
sister than a step-mum.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.120
To Chloe.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.799
What about Alexandra?

38:46.800 --> 38:47.839
Seriously.

38:47.840 --> 38:50.719
She's had her for long enough, it's
only fair that we get her.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.180
For a while.

38:53.560 --> 38:56.119
You know, the next few years of her
life will be crucial.

38:56.120 --> 38:59.159
I worry about her wasting away in
this back-water.

38:59.160 --> 39:01.719
You grew up in this back-water, it
didn't do you much harm.

39:01.720 --> 39:04.479
It's a little different, my
upbringing and Chloe's,

39:04.480 --> 39:07.199
at the moment, she's being raised
by a single mother who can't hold

39:07.200 --> 39:09.279
down a job, who drinks herself
stupid most nights.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.639
Al, you don't know that.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.040
Well, my lawyer does.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.599
What?

39:14.600 --> 39:16.559
She's made connections with
her neighbours,

39:16.560 --> 39:18.080
her old places of employment.

39:20.160 --> 39:23.399
If we have any chance of getting
Chloe back, we have to prove

39:23.400 --> 39:24.719
Alexandra's an unfit mother.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.120
Yeah, I know, I know.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.959
It's just so cruel.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.760
So's stealing her out of the country
while I was at work.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.879
She's my daughter.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.200
I have to fight for her.

40:52.840 --> 40:53.880
Hello?

41:26.800 --> 41:27.840
Alex.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.119
Hi.

41:31.120 --> 41:33.359
Sorry, the... The front door was
open, so...

41:33.360 --> 41:34.879
They're not here yet.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.260
I'm still cleaning.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.040
Righto.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.959
Anyway, thank you.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.000
Sorry.

41:50.480 --> 41:51.519
Joanna!

41:51.520 --> 41:54.559
- Can we talk to you for a moment?
- Just step back for me, please.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.280
This is an active investigation.

42:07.280 --> 42:08.660
What's that smell?

42:10.480 --> 42:12.480
Eucalyptus burning and smoke.

42:14.720 --> 42:16.759
Is that where we're headed?

42:16.760 --> 42:18.100
Let's see.

42:18.960 --> 42:21.439
And they seem to be burning
against the wind,

42:21.440 --> 42:24.039
travelling in a southeasterly direction.

42:24.040 --> 42:27.999
So, this bush fire is dangerous
and burning out of control.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.519
The CFS are warning there is a risk
to lives and property

42:31.520 --> 42:34.119
and if you're in this area,
you are in danger.

42:34.120 --> 42:38.479
You must act immediately and follow
your bush fire survival plan.

42:38.480 --> 42:42.679
Do not leave or enter the area in a
vehicle or on foot.

42:42.680 --> 42:45.359
It is too late and the roads
will not be safe.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.519
- Take shelter...
- Sounds a fair way off from us, still.

42:47.520 --> 42:49.079
"It's too late," what does that mean?

42:49.080 --> 42:52.279
- That you're going to die?
- No, no. It means it'll be safer to stay

42:52.280 --> 42:54.360
at home rather than risk trying to leave.

42:56.760 --> 42:58.759
Well, is it safe to be driving?

42:58.760 --> 42:59.799
Course.

42:59.800 --> 43:01.080
We'll be fine.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.799
- Hey there!
- Dad!

43:22.800 --> 43:26.759
Hey, can you tell Mum, Nana, that
we're a couple of hours away?

43:26.760 --> 43:28.799
I'll give her a call her when we
get to the cottage.

43:28.800 --> 43:29.919
Yeah, OK.

43:29.920 --> 43:32.020
And I'm really looking forward
to seeing you.

43:32.640 --> 43:36.140
We just saw a fair bit of smoke
here. Is there any there?

43:39.640 --> 43:41.959
We're going to have a rest when we
get to the cottage,

43:41.960 --> 43:43.560
and maybe get something to eat.

43:47.560 --> 43:51.039
I'll give you a buzz when we're
ready to come over, OK?

43:51.040 --> 43:52.540
How's my brother?

43:53.440 --> 43:57.559
He's fabulous! He told me he can't
wait to see you, too.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.000
Ha-ha-ha.

43:59.406 --> 44:00.606
OK.

44:01.760 --> 44:03.240
- I'll see you soon.
- Bye.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.060
Love you, bye.

44:19.240 --> 44:20.759
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:20.760 --> 44:23.239
So, they've landed, but they're
coming over to Nan's

44:23.240 --> 44:26.159
after they've had a nap, so they
won't be here till later tonight.

44:26.160 --> 44:28.079
Can I please stay the night?

44:28.080 --> 44:29.300
Nana said yes.

44:30.880 --> 44:31.920
Sure.

44:33.160 --> 44:34.639
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

44:34.640 --> 44:35.680
Bye.

45:01.840 --> 45:02.879
Ahoy!

45:02.880 --> 45:04.199
Shh!

45:04.200 --> 45:05.820
Found the key, then?

45:07.200 --> 45:08.879
Forgot to get some milk in for you.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.639
Oh, thank you. That's so thoughtful.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.160
And yes, found the key.

45:15.400 --> 45:19.119
I'm Alistair and this is Joanna.

45:19.120 --> 45:20.679
Oh, I know who you are!

45:20.680 --> 45:21.719
I know your mum.

45:23.880 --> 45:25.080
How old's your baby?

45:27.080 --> 45:28.600
Three months and 17 days.

45:30.040 --> 45:32.919
We're, um, we're really exhausted,
Mrs Wilson.

45:32.920 --> 45:34.679
Thank you for the milk.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.639
It's just, it's a bad time for her.

45:40.640 --> 45:41.999
Can I get her anything?

45:42.000 --> 45:43.239
Oh, no. I'll let you know.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.280
Thank you.

45:45.880 --> 45:49.719
Can you tell the court about the day
you were preparing the cottage

45:49.720 --> 45:52.159
for Joanna and Alistair's visit?

45:52.160 --> 45:56.319
I was cleaning and I popped back to
my house to get some cloths

45:56.320 --> 46:01.439
and when I got back, I found
Alexandra inside the cottage.

46:01.440 --> 46:03.800
Did she say what she was doing there?

46:04.180 --> 46:07.959
I assumed she'd come to visit them
but she was there too early.

46:07.960 --> 46:10.599
I never thought about it until later.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.240
When you told the police?

46:12.760 --> 46:13.800
Yes.

46:14.560 --> 46:16.640
They interviewed me quite a few times.

47:00.200 --> 47:01.320
I'll just be a minute.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.360
Sorry. I, um...

47:47.520 --> 47:48.560
I forgot.

48:02.160 --> 48:03.200
Hey.

48:09.520 --> 48:10.560
He sleeping?

48:18.880 --> 48:20.260
Do you need a receipt?

48:38.680 --> 48:39.720
Jo?

48:42.080 --> 48:45.780
Of all the things that can
happen to a person.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.820
There's few things that could be worse.

48:53.360 --> 48:54.560
Can you think of any?

48:56.200 --> 48:57.420
There are none.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.680
And the whole world...

49:03.000 --> 49:06.079
...they want to look at someone who
that has happened to.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.980
Everyone just wants to look at you.

49:09.400 --> 49:13.620
Everyone wants to judge you,
stare at you...

49:16.440 --> 49:20.460
...look for clues, so maybe it won't
happen to them.

49:26.160 --> 49:27.599
- Hi.
- Hi.

49:27.600 --> 49:30.020
It's just me tonight, so I may as
well eat in.

49:31.120 --> 49:32.599
Can I use your loo?

49:32.600 --> 49:33.640
Yeah, sure.

49:48.280 --> 49:50.159
There's police down on Eloura Street.

49:50.160 --> 49:52.240
They just shut it off. Can't get through.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.800
I didn't know it then.

50:03.120 --> 50:04.560
But that's when this began.

50:06.599 --> 50:07.639
Two faces.

50:17.440 --> 50:18.780
Two Joannas.

50:20.120 --> 50:23.279
I was appointed by the crown to
ascertain if Joanna Lyndsey

50:23.280 --> 50:26.999
was of sound mind and therefore
capable of standing trial.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.719
Can you give the jury a summary
of your assessment?

50:30.720 --> 50:34.879
My conclusion is that Joanna Lyndsay
is psychologically capable

50:34.880 --> 50:38.359
of understanding what is happening
to her today.

50:38.360 --> 50:42.799
Her past trauma is severe and undeniable

50:42.800 --> 50:46.100
but I believe that she is of sound mind.

50:47.440 --> 50:49.180
No more questions, my lord.

50:52.360 --> 50:53.480
My face...

50:54.920 --> 50:58.740
...I used to be able to hide behind it.

51:03.640 --> 51:06.180
Then it was like my face became a
magazine,

51:07.320 --> 51:09.620
anyone could thumb through.

51:37.240 --> 51:38.280
Jo?

51:40.740 --> 51:41.780
Jo.

51:43.960 --> 51:46.060
Jo, he's gone!

52:11.800 --> 52:13.119
Call the police!

52:13.120 --> 52:14.880
Our baby's gone! Call the police!

52:15.519 --> 52:16.559
Jo, come on!

52:19.600 --> 52:20.840
Help!

52:27.320 --> 52:29.159
Have you seen anyone holding a baby?

52:29.160 --> 52:30.200
Call the police!

52:41.600 --> 52:43.020
Our baby's gone!

52:45.000 --> 52:46.860
Jo, come on! Look!

52:50.560 --> 52:51.600
Help.

52:54.400 --> 52:55.440
Help!

52:56.920 --> 52:58.359
Help!

53:15.400 --> 53:16.440
Open.

53:19.560 --> 53:20.600
Close.

53:27.080 --> 53:28.120
All done.

53:32.440 --> 53:33.480
Thank you.

53:39.240 --> 53:40.919
I brought the blue dress, too.

53:40.920 --> 53:42.300
Oh, that's good.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.040
You OK?

53:46.920 --> 53:47.959
Mm-hmm.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.439
Five minutes.

53:50.440 --> 53:51.480
Thank you.

54:20.400 --> 54:21.440
Thank you.

54:28.760 --> 54:30.120
Do you think you might cry?

54:37.040 --> 54:39.000
And that was when the freak show began.
