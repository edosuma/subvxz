01:14.108 --> 01:18.268
They who have been, will
never be forgotten.

01:35.325 --> 01:38.453
EASTERN FRONT, March 1945

03:22.179 --> 03:23.362
This is this the place?

03:25.465 --> 03:28.761
Dolokhov, this road
doesn't go anywhere.

03:29.734 --> 03:33.064
Just because it isn't here,
doesn't mean it isn't out there.

03:35.152 --> 03:36.864
But these are
German field plans.

03:37.709 --> 03:41.484
If the Wehrmacht had positions in this
forest, they would be marked there.

03:41.514 --> 03:44.028
No. Trust me, Arkadi.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.621
Marked or not, somewhere
down there is a German camp.

03:50.119 --> 03:50.908
So...

03:54.560 --> 03:56.109
Next time someone
comes down here...

03:57.810 --> 03:58.956
We bury them...

04:00.204 --> 04:01.059
...deep.

04:04.677 --> 04:07.805
OUTPOST - OPERATION SPETSNAZ

04:43.452 --> 04:44.832
We wait for the signal.

05:27.780 --> 05:30.921
Blitz 1. Five
kilometers from base.

05:31.719 --> 05:33.071
Nothing to report.

05:43.796 --> 05:46.913
Velk units receiving.
Perimeter secure.

05:47.176 --> 05:48.885
Nothing to report.

06:56.930 --> 07:00.366
Three light vehicles. 15 men.

07:02.735 --> 07:03.806
Kill them all.

07:33.156 --> 07:34.790
We are under attack!

07:36.003 --> 07:37.531
We're under attack!

07:39.005 --> 07:40.686
Run for cover!

08:27.140 --> 08:29.844
You lying Russian dog.

08:31.694 --> 08:34.494
So, you had friends after all.

08:39.602 --> 08:40.768
We hunt.

08:49.037 --> 08:50.878
Voronin! On lookout.

09:15.146 --> 09:17.277
A little German fledgling.

09:17.981 --> 09:18.883
Gimmie!

09:27.289 --> 09:30.738
You know, it doesn't matter
how I fuck you Nazi bitches.

09:33.149 --> 09:35.487
Asshole or bullet hole.

09:36.004 --> 09:39.072
In the end, you all
scream just the same.

09:47.648 --> 09:51.441
You're colder than Mother Russia's love.
You know that, Osakin?

09:53.619 --> 09:56.661
That bitch, she wouldn't know
the meaning of the word.

09:59.679 --> 10:04.290
Listen to you all, like poets. Too
bad Stalin made you soldiers.

11:24.983 --> 11:28.204
These bastard's boots are
tied to the kwagos cunt.

11:28.234 --> 11:30.114
Give it here. I'll treat you.

11:31.138 --> 11:33.821
Please. Do you know how many
gold rings I already have?

11:33.851 --> 11:36.028
It's not just a ring
I'm offering you.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.844
There's a wife to go with it.

11:51.090 --> 11:54.592
I thought it was ammo,
weapons maybe, but...

11:56.733 --> 11:59.005
These men were not pallbearers.

12:01.217 --> 12:02.296
I don't know...

12:03.864 --> 12:07.263
But if all this came from a place
that doesn't even exist on the map...

12:11.722 --> 12:14.792
These are cards the Nazis
wanted to keep very close.

12:21.402 --> 12:22.779
We have an escort.

12:56.095 --> 12:59.973
Fyodor! Osakin! To the trees!

13:02.104 --> 13:04.339
Fucking Fritz. Go! Go!

13:14.013 --> 13:14.699
Go!

13:15.619 --> 13:16.267
Go!

13:16.464 --> 13:17.384
Move!

13:17.910 --> 13:19.138
Fyodor!

13:19.168 --> 13:20.623
Run!

13:31.163 --> 13:32.900
Kostya, go!

14:21.406 --> 14:22.345
Shit.

14:42.255 --> 14:46.450
This is important. These... This
must arrive at High Command!

14:46.480 --> 14:49.222
Yeah? You know what to look for?
Remember that,

14:49.332 --> 14:51.407
Osakin! Then go!

14:51.980 --> 14:52.797
Go!

15:17.460 --> 15:21.920
So, this is one of the
infamous Red Guard.

15:23.470 --> 15:25.930
Your existence is
almost as a mythic.

15:26.869 --> 15:29.508
But your skill is undeniable.

15:30.421 --> 15:32.553
All these special operations...

15:34.205 --> 15:37.557
Your unit has been making
quite the nuisance of itself!

15:38.810 --> 15:41.496
Assassinating our officers
with virtual impunity.

15:42.378 --> 15:44.040
If you're afraid of wolves...

15:44.829 --> 15:46.600
Don't go into the woods.

15:48.318 --> 15:50.365
I'm sorry, do you
mind if I smoke?

15:56.610 --> 15:59.822
Your comrades...
They split up.

16:01.521 --> 16:03.121
They are gone somewhere?

16:04.492 --> 16:06.097
To rape your wives.

16:07.205 --> 16:09.459
And cut your children's throats.

16:14.513 --> 16:18.776
There are two ways that you will
tell me what it is you know.

16:20.032 --> 16:23.478
Either way, you will tell me.

16:29.477 --> 16:31.158
Always the hard way...

16:35.367 --> 16:36.834
You heard the man!

16:37.182 --> 16:39.586
Cry havoc! Let loose the dogs!

17:20.231 --> 17:23.607
Not so tough now? You
Bolshevik bastard!

17:23.637 --> 17:27.386
- Where'd you think you are going, aye?
- We'll figure it out together.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.049
Potrovsky.

20:32.524 --> 20:35.623
This one we keep for Strasser.

22:34.610 --> 22:35.418
Fuck.

22:37.784 --> 22:39.944
Hell is a cold place after all.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.657
No use. That glass
is reinforced.

22:58.985 --> 22:59.999
I checked it.

23:01.323 --> 23:03.861
- Anything else?
- Not much.

23:05.138 --> 23:07.964
We're underground.
Who knows how deep.

23:08.706 --> 23:09.582
One thing...

23:10.605 --> 23:13.150
For a place who stinks
so badly of death

23:13.375 --> 23:16.877
There's no sign of vermin.
No droppings, no scent.

23:19.430 --> 23:20.350
Yes.

23:21.777 --> 23:24.849
And you know you're in trouble
when the rats have abandoned ship.

23:25.197 --> 23:27.948
And then there's this guy.
A Yankee.

23:29.436 --> 23:32.563
Hey, easy man, easy!
I'm a friend.

23:32.976 --> 23:35.267
- Rogers.
- Call me Captain.

23:35.940 --> 23:37.443
Nobody else does.

23:38.307 --> 23:40.353
Do you know how to get
out of here, Captain?

23:41.443 --> 23:42.957
Yes, sure.

23:43.154 --> 23:46.672
- I can get through that door anytime I want.
- Let us worry about the door.

23:47.652 --> 23:51.530
So what is it then, all of this?

23:52.332 --> 23:54.266
This... son...

23:56.259 --> 23:58.454
This is a goddamn
Lazarus Project.

24:02.078 --> 24:03.571
They got plans here...

24:04.127 --> 24:07.592
To make dead men stand and raise
their right hand to Hitler too.

24:08.918 --> 24:10.749
Whole place is purpose built.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.650
One giant machine.

24:14.035 --> 24:18.063
Which is why it has
a cooling system.

24:18.777 --> 24:23.143
Air ducts, service shafts,
all interconnected.

24:23.785 --> 24:27.268
- And you can navigate them?
- I got in here, didn't I?

24:29.364 --> 24:33.195
- You a spy?
- Fuck an A.... O.S.S.

24:35.455 --> 24:37.548
Arkadi, what about this?

24:39.464 --> 24:40.882
I swear, boys,

24:41.032 --> 24:44.486
I ain't seen crap this bad since I
crawled through a sewer in Paris.

24:44.984 --> 24:48.777
Might we give your jaw a rest
and put your back into this?

24:48.807 --> 24:50.013
Sure thing...

24:50.494 --> 24:53.790
Though you really want to lift
from the knees, that's the trick.

25:02.732 --> 25:03.887
Shit.

25:05.023 --> 25:07.624
And then... there was light.

25:10.696 --> 25:12.874
Subject 9 prepared for release.

25:14.198 --> 25:15.776
Let the games begin.

25:23.418 --> 25:24.976
We're in trouble now.

25:25.596 --> 25:28.601
- What the hell is that?
- I told you, they got plans.

25:30.620 --> 25:34.034
They're testing this chemical, see.
This serum.

25:34.545 --> 25:37.343
And this here, it's
a killing jar.

25:38.848 --> 25:40.895
Their own small Coliseum.

25:41.383 --> 25:44.866
And right now, we're
the Christians.

25:52.301 --> 25:55.489
- Kostya.
- And here come the fucking lions.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.499
Kostya!

26:10.402 --> 26:13.369
Those dogs won't hunt, we will!

26:15.663 --> 26:16.621
Direction.

27:19.282 --> 27:20.690
Don't be afraid.

27:26.060 --> 27:27.412
Don't be afraid.

27:53.390 --> 27:57.428
Now that is what I call
teamwork, gentlemen. High five!

28:11.775 --> 28:14.358
If you're going to use
my men as bait...

28:14.574 --> 28:17.006
try showing yours how to fight!

28:22.570 --> 28:23.744
I keep saying it...

28:24.373 --> 28:27.406
In this process, all the
components must be right.

28:28.661 --> 28:32.633
That man was a cake
decorator from Bavaria.

28:37.309 --> 28:39.375
Send in the child killer.

28:44.969 --> 28:48.988
- I think you just pissed him off.
- [????]

28:51.381 --> 28:54.752
No! Whatever happens,
Fyodor, you stay down.

29:18.152 --> 29:21.345
- Welcome to the war.
- Okay.

29:21.375 --> 29:23.702
This cooling system leads
to the surface, right?

29:23.927 --> 29:25.479
Yeah, eventually.

29:27.479 --> 29:29.338
Then you're no more use to us.

31:21.289 --> 31:22.650
Forget the subject.

31:24.246 --> 31:27.326
Let us see what this Russian
is truly capable of.

32:12.613 --> 32:13.562
Arkadi.

32:29.084 --> 32:30.286
Bravo.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.211
Stalin's dogs live up to
their reputation yet again.

32:38.648 --> 32:40.188
Oh, I'll kill you.

32:53.320 --> 32:54.428
I must say...

32:55.733 --> 32:58.437
I expected better from
our American guest.

32:59.583 --> 33:00.968
He did after all...

33:01.533 --> 33:03.738
look more Aryan than
the rest of us...

33:04.246 --> 33:05.646
put together.

33:10.403 --> 33:14.309
Apologies for your friend,
but steel sharpens steel.

33:15.233 --> 33:16.406
And in the end...

33:18.144 --> 33:22.003
I'm afraid his peasant stock
didn't meet our requirements.

33:27.496 --> 33:28.877
This man is talking.

33:30.219 --> 33:32.802
Look at him: calm, controlled...

33:32.832 --> 33:34.196
And yet ferocious.

33:35.473 --> 33:36.881
The wolf indeed.

33:38.518 --> 33:40.189
This. You see this!

33:41.006 --> 33:43.757
This is the kind of aggression
we need to harness!

33:47.366 --> 33:49.760
Some men are too
weak for the war.

33:49.873 --> 33:52.108
Others simply aren't
controllable.

33:53.956 --> 33:55.056
But a few...

33:57.580 --> 33:59.017
They are made for it.

34:01.062 --> 34:04.320
What we couldn't do with
a thousand men like you?

34:05.475 --> 34:07.569
Men who stare down bullets.

34:08.065 --> 34:09.116
Who know...

34:09.862 --> 34:10.896
the war...

34:11.619 --> 34:12.819
is not so bad.

34:18.991 --> 34:19.991
Only...

34:21.018 --> 34:22.018
endured.

34:25.378 --> 34:26.428
And that...

34:27.114 --> 34:28.715
the best we can do...

34:30.043 --> 34:31.596
is embrace death.

34:41.188 --> 34:42.188
Fall out!

34:53.456 --> 34:54.456
March!

34:58.415 --> 35:01.469
Aw, come on, look on
the bright side...

35:01.877 --> 35:04.459
At least now you get to die
for something worthwhile:

35:05.563 --> 35:07.264
The glory of the Reich.

35:21.163 --> 35:22.647
That's a very dark look.

35:24.084 --> 35:25.567
What are you thinking?

35:26.628 --> 35:28.382
That you should all surrender.

35:30.495 --> 35:31.809
Oh, I think not.

35:32.851 --> 35:36.276
I've seen your Russian mercy and
your demand for total surrender.

35:38.053 --> 35:38.823
No.

35:39.715 --> 35:41.274
We must stand and fight.

35:45.893 --> 35:47.493
We must make monsters.

35:50.221 --> 35:53.811
We know your countrymen tried to make
the perfect soldier themselves once.

35:54.703 --> 35:57.435
To splice human and ape genes.

35:57.969 --> 36:00.457
And create a
stronger individual.

36:01.688 --> 36:03.312
Unfortunately for you...

36:03.342 --> 36:07.005
Stalin is as scared of science
as he is of religion.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.084
He didn't appreciate that...

36:11.456 --> 36:13.333
one must confront ones fears...

36:13.721 --> 36:15.421
in order to conquer them.

36:17.214 --> 36:20.097
To harness nature we
must first break it...

36:20.903 --> 36:24.691
to pieces and rebuild
them in our own design.

36:37.598 --> 36:39.231
As with all things,

36:39.261 --> 36:42.674
where Russia fails,
we shall triumph.

36:44.412 --> 36:47.708
Some would call it a
blasphemous kind of alchemy.

36:48.816 --> 36:50.030
All I can say is...

36:50.896 --> 36:52.190
that it's messy work...

36:52.698 --> 36:54.153
with lots of mistakes.

36:54.294 --> 36:55.149
Hah!

37:04.735 --> 37:06.764
Are you ready with
the injections?

37:06.794 --> 37:09.224
Those samples you
stole the other day.

37:10.087 --> 37:11.829
They were of little consequence.

37:12.909 --> 37:16.139
The whole convoy, in fact, was
more a housekeeping measure.

37:18.447 --> 37:21.527
If they are to continue
our finance, Berlin...

37:22.222 --> 37:24.241
must see regular progress.

37:25.384 --> 37:27.487
The serum is purely medicinal.

37:28.369 --> 37:32.379
It conditions, prepares the body,
stimulates certain nerve centers.

37:35.552 --> 37:37.280
But the Chamber...

37:38.388 --> 37:41.515
that is a work of
Promethean fire!

37:43.464 --> 37:46.947
Herr Klausner, subject
EK-8 is in the Chamber.

37:48.344 --> 37:50.529
Initiate sequence on my signal.

37:55.095 --> 37:56.043
Firing!

37:57.943 --> 38:01.004
- Powersidence stabilized to ready.
- Running.

38:02.130 --> 38:03.557
Multiple trials.

38:04.702 --> 38:08.361
Many different combinations
and calibrations.

38:08.896 --> 38:12.220
I'm afraid we're still burning
out too many neural pathways.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.290
Which is depressing...

38:16.804 --> 38:17.804
Because...

38:19.859 --> 38:21.080
As we all know...

38:22.711 --> 38:26.101
A good soldier must
always obey his orders.

38:26.542 --> 38:29.528
Core temperature at
25 percent power.

38:39.296 --> 38:41.550
Core temperature at 50 percent.

38:49.058 --> 38:51.565
Core temperature at 55 percent.

39:04.092 --> 39:07.003
Core temperature at
90 percent power.

39:32.966 --> 39:34.956
Uber powers optimization.

39:53.135 --> 39:54.093
Of course...

39:56.196 --> 39:59.396
The are a few other kinks we
need to iron out as well.

40:01.277 --> 40:02.357
But luckily...

40:04.029 --> 40:05.982
we have fresh meat
for the grinder.

40:23.793 --> 40:25.690
But you're too valuable to us.

40:28.075 --> 40:32.667
After all, we need to see if that
serum mixes with your pig's blood.

What brings a man like you here?

40:57.155 --> 40:58.323
Your superiors,

41:02.745 --> 41:06.013
A soldier. A man who
loves to fight.

41:06.559 --> 41:09.855
- To win.
- The most dangerous kind.

41:11.601 --> 41:12.836
But this war...

41:14.714 --> 41:16.245
It doesn't need knights,

41:17.803 --> 41:19.587
it needs revolutionaries.

Because, make no mistake.

This...

This...

41:32.679 --> 41:34.022
is a revolution.

A machine...

41:38.876 --> 41:41.036
that could make men immortal...

41:43.174 --> 41:46.498
And move armies in
the blink of an eye.

41:48.142 --> 41:51.044
Just think of the lives
that we will save.

41:52.227 --> 41:54.837
Is there any price
too high for that?

41:56.154 --> 41:58.340
That our generation...

might be the last to die
on the battlefield?

under your tyranny.

care of your men.

42:20.359 --> 42:23.707
How you love them, as
you would your sons.

and spare their lives.

Not anything.

42:33.250 --> 42:35.025
With this technology...

42:36.058 --> 42:39.302

A better man would have
flayed you for less.

43:21.823 --> 43:24.414

- Yes, sir.
