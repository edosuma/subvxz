10:09.610 --> 10:11.710
Why don't you ask
for things back?

10:11.712 --> 10:13.545
Are you being bullied?

10:13.547 --> 10:16.214
Now, boys, I'm just turning
the other cheek, like Jesus.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.450
Do you think he
was bullied?

10:19.452 --> 10:20.885
(bullies laughing)

10:20.887 --> 10:24.222
Come on, guys.
Give it back.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.958
Oh... forgive them, Father.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.861
I raised a wuss.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.898
Dear Lord:
Please demonstrate unto us

10:33.900 --> 10:36.568
Uncle Homer's
not a jerk.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.703
(Homer grunting)

10:40.973 --> 10:43.208
See you in hell, old bed.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.811
(whistling a tune)

10:47.813 --> 10:49.581
Oh, come on, Chief.
Why am I in here?

10:49.583 --> 10:50.749
You're a workplace bully.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.584
Chief, I put my name
on my lunch

10:52.586 --> 10:54.252
because you are
always eating it.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.954
Bully! Bully! Bully!

10:55.956 --> 10:57.422
(phone ringing)

10:57.424 --> 10:59.491
Springfield PD.
Chief speaking.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.594
Hello? We'd like
to report a bully.

11:02.596 --> 11:04.829
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh!

11:04.831 --> 11:07.999
Wow. This bully's going down!

11:08.001 --> 11:09.668
Yeah.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.270
(siren wailing,
knocking at door)

11:12.272 --> 11:14.639
Ooh, I wonder who this could be!

11:14.641 --> 11:15.940
(screams)

11:15.942 --> 11:17.942
Homer Simpson, I'm
here to charge you

11:17.944 --> 11:21.513
with multiple counts of bullying
your neighbor, Ned Flanders.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.348
What the...?!
Oh, I never dreamed

11:23.350 --> 11:26.117
that a law I had abused
could be applied to me!

11:26.119 --> 11:28.153
All right, time
for the perp walk.

11:28.155 --> 11:31.456
Walk? But I just watered up
the Slip'N Slide.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.857
(groaning)

11:32.859 --> 11:35.293
I have no comment
at this time!

11:35.295 --> 11:37.295
I sentence you to
90 days treatment

11:37.297 --> 11:40.465
in our new Biff Stiffler
Bully Reeducation Center.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.800
Is it a school?

11:41.802 --> 11:43.301
More like a prison.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.803
Phew! Thank God.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.337
MAN:
Welcome, friends.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.473
Welcome. Welcome.
No need for names.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.141
Well, there are
need for names,

11:50.143 --> 11:51.843
or there'd be
billions of people

11:51.845 --> 11:53.545
walking around without
knowing each other,

11:53.547 --> 11:55.313
but I meant here.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.848
I know what you're going through

11:56.850 --> 11:58.650
because I'm
a recovering bully myself.

11:58.652 --> 12:01.152
I was bullied
for years and years.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.055
I tried to solve it in a way
that I don't suggest.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.657
I shot a man.

12:05.659 --> 12:07.025
But that didn't fix it.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.694
It fixed it for him.
He died.

12:09.696 --> 12:12.497
But I then went
to a lot of training.

12:12.499 --> 12:16.000
I went into the Army,
and I was punished,

12:16.002 --> 12:18.503
and they told me I got over it.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.406
I don't feel it,
but I'm told I got over it,

12:21.408 --> 12:23.041
and I have something on the wall

12:23.043 --> 12:24.709
that says I do.
Ow!

12:24.711 --> 12:28.413
Time for step one on the path
to empathy, you maggots.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.082
Can I do yard work
like the kids?

12:31.084 --> 12:34.252
Your work is internal.
You mean like vacuuming?

12:34.254 --> 12:36.521
Did you really think
I meant vacuuming?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.890
When I said "internal,"
your brain went

12:38.892 --> 12:41.760
to something inside your
house like vacuuming?

12:41.762 --> 12:43.728
Is that what you thought?

12:43.730 --> 12:47.232
Do you know that's why that
Dyson is a billionaire?

12:47.234 --> 12:50.201
Something is wrong with you
when you think vacuuming.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.437
I'm talking about
inside your head.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.872
In your head!

12:53.874 --> 12:56.207
Oh, it's so boring in there.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.575
Oh, is it?

12:57.577 --> 12:59.544
And I thought it might
be like the Louvre.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.945
Now, no more talking!

13:00.947 --> 13:02.547
I know how this works.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.449
You find the toughest one,
you crack that person,

13:04.451 --> 13:06.384
and the rest of you
fall in line.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.553
You'll never crack me.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.722
(chuckles)
Ah, you're probably right.

13:10.724 --> 13:13.458
Just like you never heard
your mother say,

13:13.460 --> 13:14.793
"I love you."

13:14.795 --> 13:16.561
(sobbing)

13:16.563 --> 13:20.231
There's not enough tissue in
the world for what I'm feeling!

13:20.233 --> 13:21.566
(sobbing)

13:21.568 --> 13:23.234
There, there.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.136
The first six
tissues are free.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.571
The rest you pay for.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.106
Use the first two again.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.774
They don't seem very wet.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.075
Every bully

13:31.077 --> 13:32.744
is woven
from the colorful thread

13:32.746 --> 13:34.779
known as humiliation.

13:34.781 --> 13:37.248
Gary, who humiliated you?

13:37.250 --> 13:38.449
Well... (clears throat)

13:38.451 --> 13:40.618
my father was a
psychologist.

13:40.620 --> 13:44.455
He was a big believer
in the methods of B.F. <i>Skinner!</i>

13:44.457 --> 13:48.326
I had to go through a hamster
maze to get to my breakfast.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.261
Which way is love, Daddy?

13:50.263 --> 13:51.930
(voice breaking):
Which way is love?

13:51.932 --> 13:53.264
(crying)

13:53.266 --> 13:57.936
He made me go
through a maze.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.772
Ah. Breakthrough.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.273
Just sit down, Gary.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.275
Have the free potato chips.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.944
You, we'll just
heavily medicate.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.512
I'm sorry,
there's no other hope.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.947
Give me your money.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.448
Oh, beautiful.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.317
You're just proving my point.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.685
What about you, Homer?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.987
Why do you hate
this... Flanders?

14:15.989 --> 14:19.190
Well, he thinks he's so perfect,
with his organized garage

14:19.192 --> 14:22.293
and his barbecue grill
that never has crud on it.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.962
That's very good.
Keep exploring.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.164
I'm already hating him
a little bit.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.000
Kids who love him
and rub his back.

14:29.002 --> 14:32.170
And he's got enough extra hair
for a mustache!

14:32.172 --> 14:34.806
All I got are Archie
and Wicket here.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.808
I'm so bald.

14:36.810 --> 14:39.177
Deeper. You've got
to go deeper!

14:39.179 --> 14:40.979
(in a deep voice):
I'm so bald.

14:40.981 --> 14:44.315
Deeper! And if you think
I mean on the ground,

14:44.317 --> 14:45.717
I'm going to punch you!

14:45.719 --> 14:47.819
Why do you hate Flanders?

14:47.821 --> 14:49.888
Oh, everybody
hates Flanders.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.389
No, just you.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.490
That's right.
Great guy.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.858
He ain't no chooch.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.727
Homer, you've got
to find the answer to this.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.029
It's been bothering you
your whole life.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.064
Also, it's five to 11:00.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.900
I have ten more people
before noon!

15:01.902 --> 15:04.402
Oh, can you just
tell me the answer?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.004
If I told you the answer,

15:06.006 --> 15:08.740
then you would not have
discovered it for yourself.

15:08.742 --> 15:11.576
Did you see that, uh,
<i>Indiana Jones</i> movie?

15:11.578 --> 15:14.846
Did anybody tell him
where that thing was?

15:14.848 --> 15:16.748
Does this guy know?
Well...

15:16.750 --> 15:19.584
Only you know!
All right.

15:19.586 --> 15:23.021
I hate Ned Flanders because...

15:23.023 --> 15:24.522
(gasps)

15:24.524 --> 15:27.692
...because he's better
than me in every way!

15:27.694 --> 15:30.929
I think we have a breakthrough.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.764
I was gonna say that, too.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.370
♪

15:39.372 --> 15:41.539
I used to be a jerk.

15:41.541 --> 15:45.276
I never cared whose feelings I
hurt as long as it got a laugh.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.212
I took a thumb
when a pinky would do.

15:48.214 --> 15:51.716
But we have learned our lesson,
so I hereby promise...

15:51.718 --> 15:53.051
I promise.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.218
I promise.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.420
<i>Te prometo.</i>

15:55.422 --> 15:57.121
We all promise.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.924
ALL:
To be a better human being.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.559
Better human being.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.394
Ugh! Once again, people.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.964
ALL
To be a better human being.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.398
Better being.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.967
Does he have
to be in this?

16:08.969 --> 16:11.235
Well, surprisingly,
that was our best take.

16:11.237 --> 16:14.472
Uh, question: What will
this video be used for?

16:14.474 --> 16:17.141
Oh, in schools,
by police groups.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.744
CNN. They're doing
a lot of things now

16:19.746 --> 16:21.746
that have nothing
to do with news.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.415
This is great.
Nothing America likes better

16:24.417 --> 16:27.318
than someone who screws up,
goes away for a little while,

16:27.320 --> 16:28.920
then comes back
and tells everyone

16:28.922 --> 16:30.254
how to live their lives.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.590
Oh, I forgot
to include remorse.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.258
Oh, it's okay.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.661
When it kicks in,
it'll be a thousand times worse.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.429
What happened to me?

16:38.431 --> 16:40.331
My mother told me she loved me.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.133
Maybe I couldn't hear her

16:42.135 --> 16:44.802
because my hand
was over her mouth.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.605
Let yourself out, please.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.008
ANNOUNCER:
And here to throw out
the first pitch,

16:50.010 --> 16:52.176
reformed bully Homer Simpson.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.647
And the pitch hits the umpire,

16:56.649 --> 16:58.449
but it's not an umpire at all.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.119
It's a returning
serviceman from Iraq.

17:01.121 --> 17:04.455
And the crowd goes wild.
(applause and cheering)

17:04.457 --> 17:05.957
You're a hero.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.658
No, you're-you're the hero. I...

17:07.660 --> 17:09.494
No, no, you're wrong.
You're the hero.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.695
I... No, I just...
I'm not.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.630
I-I just have
a little PTSD.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.465
No, if you see a hero,

17:14.467 --> 17:17.135
you're looking into a mirror,
man, because you're the hero.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.771
Why is Mr. Simpson a hero?

17:20.639 --> 17:22.140
Well, I suppose it's because

17:22.142 --> 17:24.976
he used to be bad
and now he's good.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.011
Yay?
Yay?

17:27.013 --> 17:30.681
MALE ANNOUNCER:
Jenny, the Costington's float
contains 10,001 flowers,

17:30.683 --> 17:34.018
and work started the day after
last year's parade finished.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.987
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
You say that every year,

17:35.989 --> 17:37.321
and it's just not true.

17:37.323 --> 17:38.689
(male announcer chuckles)

17:38.691 --> 17:40.825
MALE ANNOUNCER:
Well, there you go again.

17:40.827 --> 17:44.395
Daddy, maybe someday you'll
be a hero like Mr. Simpson.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.398
He's a hero, all right.
A hero sandwich full of baloney.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.734
Huh. I almost said that
in front of the boys!

17:49.736 --> 17:52.403
Time I gave that Homer
a real tongue bath!

17:52.405 --> 17:55.239
Ooh.
Glad I didn't say that, either.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.876
Uh-huh! Uh, wait.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.678
What do you want me
to do with this?

18:00.680 --> 18:02.080
NED:
How about writing,
"I'm sorry, Ned"?

18:02.082 --> 18:04.215
(mutters)
What are you doing here?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.750
Homer, sorry is not just

18:05.752 --> 18:07.418
the most exciting
board game ever devised.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.520
It's a word I need
to hear from you.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.522
(sighs)
Fine. Sorry. We good?

18:11.524 --> 18:13.191
No, we're not good!

18:13.193 --> 18:15.526
You really think one little
"sorry" makes up for years of,

18:15.528 --> 18:19.030
"Stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid Flanders"?

18:19.032 --> 18:22.366
I'm starting to think
you don't want an autograph.

18:22.368 --> 18:23.768
This is what I want.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.704
I want you to understand
how you make me feel.

18:26.706 --> 18:32.210
Homer Simpson, you made me less
of a man in my sons' eyes.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.345
Now do you feel remorse?

18:35.247 --> 18:37.715
Oh, my God.
I'm a monster.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.050
Mm-hmm.

18:39.052 --> 18:40.551
Wait! You can't go!

18:40.553 --> 18:42.954
I need your forgiveness!

18:42.956 --> 18:46.290
You can't push a guy
around forever, Dad.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.893
You better take a long,
fat look in the mirror.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.461
I know.

18:51.897 --> 18:54.065
(Homer groaning)

18:54.067 --> 18:56.601
Oh, driveway! Oh!

18:56.603 --> 18:59.570
I crawled here on my knees,
all the way from my house,

18:59.572 --> 19:01.572
to ask for your
forgiveness.

19:01.574 --> 19:04.475
Well, sir, I appreciate that,
but I don't bend that easily.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.444
Well, I'm gonna wait
right here on my knees

19:06.446 --> 19:08.646
till you change your mind.
Okily-dokily.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.982
On my knees!
Mm-hmm. I hear you.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.217
Not too comfortable.
Nor should it be.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.521
♪

19:33.338 --> 19:36.007
I think he's suffered
enough, Daddy.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.576
And he seems
to be sinking.

19:39.945 --> 19:42.613
We're losing him.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.682
"And when you
stand praying,

19:44.684 --> 19:47.451
"if you hold anything
against anyone, forgive him,

19:47.453 --> 19:50.354
so that your Father in Heaven
may forgive you your sins."

19:50.356 --> 19:52.456
That's from that
ribbon book.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.025
Yes, it is, Homer.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.661
And I forgive you,
transgressoreeno.

19:56.663 --> 20:01.199
Now, Ned, why don't you join us
for an all-is-forgiven brunch?

20:01.201 --> 20:03.134
Oh, can I make
my famous mimosa?

20:03.136 --> 20:06.204
A little sparkling water and
a glass full of regular water?

20:06.206 --> 20:09.307
Stu... pendous, Flanders.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.209
(Homer chuckles)

20:19.551 --> 20:22.653
Hey, Miss Drizzle!
Otto! Otto!

20:22.655 --> 20:24.388
How many tabs did you take?

20:24.390 --> 20:27.658
(chuckles)
I took a whole sheet
of Hello Kitties!

20:27.660 --> 20:29.393
Oh, Otto! That will have

20:29.395 --> 20:31.996
a most deleterious effect
on your brain.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.899
The cerebrum, the cerebellum,
the medulla.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.867
But why am I telling
you about it

20:36.869 --> 20:40.338
when we can visit the
inside of your head?

20:40.340 --> 20:43.741
Bus, do your stuff!

20:44.743 --> 20:47.345
(cheering)

20:47.347 --> 20:50.081
Aah! Get it out! Get it out!

20:52.517 --> 20:54.752
(screaming)

20:57.356 --> 20:58.556
MAN:
Mr. Foreman?

20:58.558 --> 21:00.558
Mr. Foreman,
please wake up!

21:00.560 --> 21:02.593
Aah! Who murdered who again?
