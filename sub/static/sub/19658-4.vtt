WEBVTT

00:04.187 --> 00:05.380
This place smells like

00:05.498 --> 00:08.305
the wrong end of
a Chitauri slime slug!

00:09.451 --> 00:11.190
Yeah, brings back
a lot of great memories

00:11.306 --> 00:13.665
of hanging out here
with Yondu and the Ravagers.

00:13.774 --> 00:16.132
The fun games they used
to have me play...

00:16.236 --> 00:17.260
"Scrub the Decks,"

00:17.344 --> 00:19.681
"Lug the Grub,"
"Unclog the Latrine."

00:19.756 --> 00:22.763
Aw, krutack! Those
weren't games, were they?

00:22.985 --> 00:25.620
Quill, I hate to interrupt
this stroll down memory lane,

00:25.721 --> 00:27.664
but we need to find
the sarcophagus

00:27.761 --> 00:30.232
before it falls into
the hands of the Believers.

00:30.325 --> 00:32.125
Right, Rocket?

00:32.381 --> 00:34.531
Hey, is it my fault
Yondu stole it?

00:34.699 --> 00:36.716
Actually, it is.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.356
Picky, picky.

00:38.369 --> 00:39.892
Besides, even if those nutjobs

00:39.942 --> 00:41.836
get their grubby paws
on that thingy,

00:41.922 --> 00:44.141
there's only a 50-50 chance
it'll destroy the universe.

00:44.297 --> 00:47.281
Those are terrible odds.
Relax, Gamora.

00:47.374 --> 00:48.782
Now, if I know Yondu...

00:49.082 --> 00:50.340
And I do know Yondu,

00:50.414 --> 00:51.802
he probably stashed
the sarcophagus

00:51.869 --> 00:53.183
in one of these old hideouts

00:53.238 --> 00:54.976
until he can negotiate
the best deal.

00:55.037 --> 00:57.515
All we gotta do is search
each one until we find it.

00:57.596 --> 01:00.071
Easy as pie.
I have attempted pie.

01:00.136 --> 01:02.790
It is extremely difficult,
especially the crust.

01:02.871 --> 01:05.294
My sensitive snout
can't take much more of this.

01:05.373 --> 01:07.689
Let's give this dump a
once-over and get outta here.

01:13.124 --> 01:14.549
I am Groot!

01:16.135 --> 01:17.267
Careful, Rocket.

01:17.339 --> 01:20.096
These Ravager hideouts are
notorious for booby traps.

01:20.237 --> 01:23.080
That's right! And I'm the
booby who set those traps.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.513
Oh, I mean, I built these
when I was a teenager,

01:25.619 --> 01:26.972
and they still work
like a charm.

01:27.046 --> 01:28.621
But don't worry.
You stick close,

01:28.690 --> 01:30.882
you don't touch anything,
I can get you through.

01:34.868 --> 01:36.725
This will not end well.

01:39.568 --> 01:42.258
Just do what I do.
Come on, it's awesome!

01:42.371 --> 01:44.940
This is almost
as difficult as pie.

01:50.343 --> 01:52.982
And almost as deadly
as your pies, Drax.

01:53.062 --> 01:56.343
Besides, dancing is for suckers!

01:59.054 --> 02:00.927
Any sign of the sarcophagus?

02:01.083 --> 02:02.902
Nope, but I found this!

02:10.732 --> 02:11.806
Oh, come on!

02:11.946 --> 02:13.701
It's a monkey, people.

02:13.774 --> 02:15.589
And it plays the drums!

02:15.960 --> 02:17.784
I am Groot?

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074

02:33.987 --> 02:37.267
Huh? What did you do?

02:37.420 --> 02:40.621
Oh, I think he triggered
one of my old booby traps.

02:40.837 --> 02:43.853
Oh, yeah!
Oh, I remember this one.

02:53.656 --> 02:55.467
<i>You've reached
the Ravagers' hideout.</i>

02:55.554 --> 02:57.220
Hey, look. That's me.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.635
<i>We're not right here now,</i>

02:58.732 --> 03:01.106
<i>but prepare to be destroyed
at the beep.</i>

03:01.227 --> 03:02.526
<i>Beep!</i>

03:04.682 --> 03:05.945
<i>Better luck next time!</i>

03:06.014 --> 03:08.319
<i>Oh, wait.
There won't be a next time.</i>

03:08.625 --> 03:10.192
I hate this kid.

03:16.295 --> 03:20.079

03:23.688 --> 03:25.023
<i>Congratulations.</i>

03:25.114 --> 03:28.526
<i>You have activated a patented
Peter Quill booby trap.</i>

03:29.857 --> 03:32.091
Quill, you built this trap!

03:32.174 --> 03:35.655
- Where's the kill switch?
- There isn't one!

03:35.856 --> 03:38.872
What kind of idiot builds
a trap without a kill switch?

03:39.050 --> 03:41.795
Oh, give me a break! This is
some of my earliest work!

03:41.929 --> 03:43.489
You should see my later stuff.

03:43.589 --> 03:45.209
If we live that long!

03:45.244 --> 03:46.668
All right, this way!

03:46.704 --> 03:49.113
Only step on the green tiles.

03:49.180 --> 03:51.540
Orit might have been
the red ones.

03:55.780 --> 03:57.080
Yeah, it's the red ones!

03:57.115 --> 03:58.326
Quill!

03:58.419 --> 04:02.015
Where'd you get so many
krutackin' barrels?

04:02.128 --> 04:03.541
Cargo ship raid,
back in the day.

04:03.641 --> 04:05.048
I always wondered
what was in them.

04:06.929 --> 04:08.735
This smells like
Rajak root slime.

04:08.818 --> 04:10.297
Rajak root slime?

04:10.390 --> 04:13.070
That stuff's more potent
than proton fuel!

04:14.941 --> 04:16.137
Oh...

04:24.546 --> 04:26.455
Man, I told you
I make some awesome traps.

04:26.551 --> 04:29.609
Did you happen to notice that
you almost got us incinerated?

04:29.714 --> 04:31.571
But I didn't! Where's Groot?

04:31.781 --> 04:34.423
Ah, krutack! He's still inside!

04:36.280 --> 04:37.736
Groot, where are ya?

04:37.771 --> 04:38.944
Whoa!

04:40.513 --> 04:42.914
I am Groot!

04:43.018 --> 04:45.019
You stayed here for an egg?

04:45.464 --> 04:46.593
Very wise.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.801
Eggs are part of
a nutritious breakfast.

04:48.867 --> 04:51.021
And omelets are much
easier than pie.

04:52.844 --> 04:55.013
I am Groot!

04:55.206 --> 04:58.383
Easy! Nobody's gonna cook
your precious egg!

04:58.516 --> 05:01.015
Groot can get very attached
to helpless weaklings.

05:01.117 --> 05:03.077
You should not describe
yourself in such a manner.

05:03.155 --> 05:05.883
I meant we should let him keep
the stupid egg

05:05.984 --> 05:08.928
until this nurturing phase
has run its course.

05:09.022 --> 05:11.792
Fine. How long can that take?

05:12.682 --> 05:15.213
Groot! That's my chair!

05:16.002 --> 05:17.502
I am Groot.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.796
He's got a point.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.976
It is the comfiest seat
on board,

05:27.045 --> 05:30.411
especially with the temperature
control and built-in massager.

05:30.484 --> 05:33.728
Yeah. I know. That's
because it's my seat!

05:33.861 --> 05:35.736
How am I supposed
to fly the ship?

05:39.163 --> 05:40.933
I am Groot.

05:49.652 --> 05:52.278
Three more hideouts,
and still no sarcophagus.

05:52.398 --> 05:54.375
Whoa! Ow!

05:54.575 --> 05:56.852
Hey, where's my hammock?

05:59.061 --> 06:01.124
I am Groot.

06:02.031 --> 06:03.752
Don't shush me.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.539
That's my hammock!

06:08.458 --> 06:10.093
And my mitt!

06:13.927 --> 06:16.927
I am Groot.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.213
Anyone seen my headphones?

06:33.517 --> 06:35.379
Rocket said Groot heard
that playing music

06:35.442 --> 06:37.342
was supposed to be good
for intelligence.

06:37.426 --> 06:39.669
Oh, yeah.
My mom did that with me.

06:39.768 --> 06:41.525
I am Groot.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.187
Groot? Hey, buddy,

06:46.296 --> 06:47.816
I found the perfect place
for your egg.

06:47.866 --> 06:48.866
It's warm and cozy.

06:48.910 --> 06:51.628
It has dim lighting
and soothing ambient sounds.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.256
Ooh! I am Groot.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.659
And best of all,
it's nowhere near my stuff.

06:57.713 --> 06:59.999
Much better. All right,
what's our status?

07:00.078 --> 07:03.109
We're approaching the Ravager
hideout on Veros Seven.

07:03.208 --> 07:06.777
Yes! That hideout has
my trap-making masterpiece.

07:06.908 --> 07:08.869
My magnum opus.

07:08.932 --> 07:11.486
Oh, okay, that has to be where
Yondu hid the sarcophagus,

07:11.570 --> 07:15.100
'cause my trap there is
so mind-blowingly awesome.

07:15.525 --> 07:17.703
You do realize we don't
actually want to get caught

07:17.780 --> 07:19.269
in one of your
stupid traps, right?

07:19.329 --> 07:21.563
Well, duh.
The only thing I'm better at

07:21.660 --> 07:23.700
than building traps
is dodging them.

07:23.813 --> 07:26.285
There isn't a trap made
that I can't get out of,

07:26.432 --> 07:28.647
except maybe my masterpiece
on Veros Seven.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.482
No one can get outta
that bad boy!

07:32.098 --> 07:33.860
Engines are shutting down!

07:33.942 --> 07:36.643
Whoa! I just did our
400,000-light-year checkup!

07:36.730 --> 07:38.183
What could've caused this?

07:38.711 --> 07:40.541
Groot!

07:43.245 --> 07:45.300
I am Groot.

07:45.388 --> 07:47.043
Just 'cause Quill told you
to stay here

07:47.136 --> 07:49.051
don't mean you gotta listen
to him!

07:49.120 --> 07:51.766
Uh, Groot, old buddy, I'm
sorry I stuck you in there,

07:51.791 --> 07:53.699
but if we don't get
those engines cleared,

07:53.801 --> 07:55.865
all you're gonna be left with
is scrambled eggs!

07:55.938 --> 07:57.446
I like scrambled eggs.

07:57.526 --> 07:58.759
Although, I prefer omelets.

07:58.844 --> 08:00.288
Not helping!

08:21.616 --> 08:23.825
Okay, just so you know,
I blame you for this.

08:23.865 --> 08:27.371
You and the stupid egg that's
probably never gonna hatch!

08:27.583 --> 08:29.237
I am Groot!

08:29.324 --> 08:32.769
Cool down, both of you! This
damage ain't as bad as it looks.

08:32.854 --> 08:36.705
Well, fine! You fix it while we
go and check the Ravager hideout.

08:37.239 --> 08:38.980
Drax, stay and give me a hand.

08:39.133 --> 08:40.558
Groot ain't gonna be much help.

08:40.615 --> 08:42.726
I am Groot.

08:46.780 --> 08:48.910
Try and keep up,
will you?

08:49.953 --> 08:51.810
- Be patient with him.
- Oh, sure.

08:51.883 --> 08:53.525
"Everybody be patient
with Groot!"

08:53.605 --> 08:56.275
No one was half this nice
when I got into roller disco.

08:56.431 --> 08:58.457
Groot's behavior is selfless,
nurturing,

08:58.514 --> 09:00.132
and irritates
the krutack out of you.

09:00.169 --> 09:02.133
I don't have a problem
with any of those things.

09:06.345 --> 09:08.987
Halt, non-Believers.

09:09.935 --> 09:12.939
Black Dwarf and Proxima Midnight?
Oh, that's great.

09:13.017 --> 09:14.242
'Cause this day just
wouldn't be complete

09:14.266 --> 09:16.333
without a couple
of Black Order goons!

09:16.657 --> 09:18.733
You have something we want.

09:18.799 --> 09:21.089
Give it to us, or be destroyed!

09:21.545 --> 09:22.545
I am Groot!

09:22.771 --> 09:25.287
Groot, FYI,

09:25.312 --> 09:27.035
I kind of blame you
for this, too.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.443
The sarcophagus! Where is it?

09:44.864 --> 09:47.334
The sarcophagus and its
contents will be ours,

09:47.625 --> 09:49.286
for we believe.

09:51.563 --> 09:53.038
Believe this!

09:54.311 --> 09:55.517
I am Groot!

09:55.561 --> 09:57.258
Anytime you wanna help, Groot!

09:58.291 --> 10:00.770
Bring me the sarcophagus!

10:01.103 --> 10:02.161
Not on your life.

10:08.732 --> 10:09.993
Did the entire Black Order

10:10.078 --> 10:12.139
join up with those
crackpot Believers?

10:12.206 --> 10:15.388
Maybe their buddy Ebony Maw
got them a group discount!

10:16.609 --> 10:18.066
The tree is hiding something.

10:18.289 --> 10:20.209
It must be what we seek.

10:27.509 --> 10:30.978
Give it your best shot.
We got you outnumbered.

10:31.057 --> 10:34.003
That's unfortunate, but it's
still an even match.

10:40.838 --> 10:43.413
Stand still
and accept your fate!

10:43.577 --> 10:45.023
You first!

11:03.544 --> 11:04.848
You cannot win,

11:04.937 --> 11:07.391
for I believe I am
impervious to your attacks.

11:23.611 --> 11:25.833
I believe I will break free.

11:32.081 --> 11:33.203
Whoa.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.449
Quill!

11:39.864 --> 11:41.411
Eyes on the enemy!

11:41.477 --> 11:45.001
Tell your cowardly wooden friend
to give us the sarcophagus!

11:45.248 --> 11:47.918
He doesn't have it!
None of us do!

11:48.016 --> 11:49.016
Liar!

11:49.060 --> 11:51.482
I believe we will bury you.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.443
Groot!

11:59.463 --> 12:00.977
Little help?

12:18.144 --> 12:19.758
Ha! Who's buried now, sucker?

12:19.841 --> 12:22.017
I believe it's you!

12:35.868 --> 12:37.115
I am Groot!

12:37.199 --> 12:40.195
Well, look who decided to show up
after leaving us high and dry.

12:40.297 --> 12:42.163
I am Groot.

12:42.250 --> 12:44.438
Tell Groot I'm not
talking to him.

12:44.510 --> 12:46.499
Let's focus on finding
the sarcophagus

12:46.554 --> 12:48.783
before the Believers get
their hands on it.

12:48.859 --> 12:50.258
Okay, the path's a bit
overgrown,

12:50.312 --> 12:52.306
but I think the Ravagers'
hideout is over there.

12:52.364 --> 12:55.436
And tell this walking knothead
to stay out of my way!

13:02.580 --> 13:05.295
As promised,
one Ravager hideout.

13:12.850 --> 13:15.137
Doesn't look like anyone's
been here in years.

13:15.296 --> 13:18.384
- There it is!
- The sarcophagus?

13:18.455 --> 13:22.135
Nope, my magnum opus!
The trap to end all traps.

13:25.602 --> 13:28.568
Tell Groot not to touch
my masterpiece.

13:28.699 --> 13:30.279
I am Groot.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.223
- What did he say?
- I have no idea.

13:32.316 --> 13:34.040
Watch this.

13:34.114 --> 13:37.570
Even the slightest touch
will trigger the...

13:38.029 --> 13:40.684
Huh. Is it...
Will, will trigger the...

13:41.209 --> 13:42.813
Oh, come on!

13:51.168 --> 13:52.766
All right, must be sand
in the gears.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.598
Nothing a good old blast
of wind won't fix!

13:56.255 --> 13:57.698
Should you really be doing that?

13:57.751 --> 13:59.496
I just want to make sure
the trap is working

13:59.520 --> 14:02.033
in case those Black Order goons show up...

14:06.662 --> 14:07.662
Uh-oh.

14:11.697 --> 14:13.975
Okay, it's working!

14:14.058 --> 14:15.796
This is your famous trap?

14:15.862 --> 14:17.376
It's just a big hole
in the ground.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.090
Uh, you think?

14:30.842 --> 14:32.492
Big hole in the ground, huh?

14:32.573 --> 14:34.438
I dare you to find a way out!

14:34.490 --> 14:36.273
You're on!

14:38.621 --> 14:40.143
Whoa!

14:40.943 --> 14:42.617
Not one word.

14:43.580 --> 14:44.833
Word.

14:44.876 --> 14:47.648
- <i>Welcome to the Star-Lord 2000X-Scape.</i>
- I didn't say anything. He did!

14:47.672 --> 14:49.616
<i>It's the latest
in trap-making technology.</i>

14:52.360 --> 14:55.408
<i>Can't get a grip? That's because
this baby's built with a seamless,</i>

14:55.444 --> 14:57.800
<i>frictionless,
12-inch metal alloy.</i>

14:57.949 --> 14:59.851
<i>But wait! There's more!</i>

14:59.904 --> 15:02.361
<i>It also has our patented
randomized laser grid.</i>

15:02.426 --> 15:04.996
- <i>It slices, it dices!</i> Rocket!
- Drax! Can you hear me?

15:05.070 --> 15:06.717
<i>And don't even think
about calling for help,</i>

15:06.741 --> 15:09.327
<i>'cause this trap comes
with a powerful EMP generator,</i>

15:09.387 --> 15:12.067
<i>guaranteed to stop any broadcast
signals from getting out.</i>

15:12.104 --> 15:13.607
<i>Don't call now,
operators are not standing by.</i>

15:13.631 --> 15:15.867
Ha! I don't remember
being that annoying back then.

15:15.967 --> 15:19.313
Some things never change
So, what now, genius?

15:19.377 --> 15:20.670
And this is my fault?

15:20.711 --> 15:23.918
It appears you were
telling the truth after all.

15:24.051 --> 15:28.011
At least the part about the walking
tree not having the sarcophagus.

15:28.399 --> 15:30.171
Well, look who joined the party.

15:30.254 --> 15:33.670
The original Black Order
Believer himself, Ebony Maw.

15:33.755 --> 15:36.751
Apparently, I'll need
to extract the location

15:36.825 --> 15:40.079
of the sarcophagus
directly from your minds.

15:40.549 --> 15:42.331
Ha! Good luck with that!

15:42.404 --> 15:44.356
Even the most powerful
Believer can't just wish

15:44.396 --> 15:45.957
for that kind of mental ability.

15:46.048 --> 15:48.027
I don't need to wish.

15:48.187 --> 15:50.314
I believe.

15:54.284 --> 15:58.005
More importantly,
so does everyone on that ship.

16:01.644 --> 16:05.841
Their Belief Energy
powers me a thousandfold!

16:08.541 --> 16:11.436
And you will believe, too!

16:12.011 --> 16:13.197
Can you believe this...

16:21.040 --> 16:23.581
I will find the location
of the sarcophagus,

16:23.636 --> 16:26.523
even if it tears
your minds apart!

16:26.890 --> 16:30.346
With Quill, how
will you know the difference?

16:30.483 --> 16:34.223
Hey, I heard that!
My mind is as sharp as a...

16:40.860 --> 16:44.602
Now let us see what secrets
this mind holds.

17:06.977 --> 17:09.497
What vile abomination is this?

17:11.714 --> 17:13.928
It's a monkey playing the drums.

17:14.181 --> 17:15.836
Come on, man, it's funny!

17:15.932 --> 17:18.246
You think this is a joke?

17:31.219 --> 17:34.383
I am Groot?

17:34.553 --> 17:36.453
Groot...

17:50.470 --> 17:54.851
Dude, why didn't you tell me you were
hatching an energy-absorbing parasite?

17:55.053 --> 17:56.567
Who can do that!

17:57.015 --> 17:59.349
Nice birdie! Whoa!

18:01.680 --> 18:03.427
I am Groot!

18:03.507 --> 18:08.090
Your pathetic pet can't save
you from my mental siphon!

18:12.441 --> 18:13.560
Really?

18:13.626 --> 18:15.772
'Cause it looks like
baby bird's doing

18:15.841 --> 18:18.340
a little siphoning of his own!

18:18.632 --> 18:20.242
Boom!

18:28.318 --> 18:30.518
It shorted out
the pit's defenses!

18:30.604 --> 18:32.007
I am Groot.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.246
Groot.

18:37.698 --> 18:39.872
Hey, what about us?

18:42.013 --> 18:43.395
Whoa!

18:54.187 --> 18:56.834
Whoa! Okay, drop us anywhere!

18:58.975 --> 19:01.195
I believe we will be saved!

19:04.773 --> 19:06.709
I am Groot!

19:23.273 --> 19:25.499
Impossible!

19:32.230 --> 19:34.710
No! Don't leave us!

19:34.850 --> 19:38.172
- We still have a score to settle.
- Brain freeze!

19:46.387 --> 19:48.173
I believe we should run!

19:51.842 --> 19:55.177
They're getting away.
I don't think so.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.904
Wait for it.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.980
You know, those traps aren't
as useless as I thought.

20:07.617 --> 20:10.996
Groot, I'm sorry I gave you such
a hard time about that egg.

20:11.101 --> 20:13.244
I had no idea that
it was gonna turn into

20:13.357 --> 20:16.994
an awesome lightning-shooting
space eagle!

20:22.685 --> 20:25.196
Wait. He's not the only one?

20:25.386 --> 20:27.908
Apparently, Yondu stole
the egg from this planet.

20:28.126 --> 20:29.847
What are the odds?

20:32.475 --> 20:35.124
Groot.

20:38.291 --> 20:39.938
I am Groot.

20:47.245 --> 20:48.811
You're just gonna let him go?

20:48.871 --> 20:50.306
I know that was hard, Groot,

20:50.378 --> 20:51.923
but it was the right thing
to do.

20:51.994 --> 20:53.966
Don't you agree, Peter?

20:54.129 --> 20:55.251
Yeah, I guess so.

20:55.331 --> 20:57.750
But, I mean,
a lightning space eagle?

20:57.810 --> 21:00.325
That would have totally rocked!

21:00.558 --> 21:03.452
Am I to understand that you
did not locate the sarcophagus?

21:03.542 --> 21:05.279
What a waste of time!

21:05.356 --> 21:07.179
Well, not a total waste.

21:07.245 --> 21:09.027
I did find something down there.

21:10.235 --> 21:11.672
Something for you, Groot.

21:11.759 --> 21:14.305
You know, to make up
for me being such a jerk.

21:14.647 --> 21:17.113
I am Groot.

21:22.867 --> 21:25.455
I am Groot?

21:25.768 --> 21:28.448
I am Groot.

21:28.528 --> 21:30.007
I am Groot!

21:30.112 --> 21:32.682
What? How was I
supposed to know?
