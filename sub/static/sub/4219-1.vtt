00:01.502 --> 00:02.710
Hallie!

00:04.004 --> 00:07.048
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:13.055 --> 00:14.931
Nothing makes sense.

00:19.061 --> 00:22.063
I know it's been a tough
couple of shifts for everybody.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.775
But that is why
this place is gonna rock.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.985
- To Molly's.
- To Molly's.

00:33.659 --> 00:36.285
Unfortunately, you did not make Squad
this time around.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.581
I'd like an application, please.

00:40.708 --> 00:41.874
Darden!

00:44.712 --> 00:46.295
Andy was one of my best friends.

00:46.422 --> 00:47.922
And he was your husband.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.716
Why can't we be happy?

00:49.842 --> 00:52.468
- So, lesbian, huh?
- Pop, what the hell?

00:54.346 --> 00:56.139
I've been searching
for the perfect guy

00:56.265 --> 00:57.432
to be the father of my baby.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.851
I wanna know if you'd like
to have a baby with me.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.894
I'm in.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.230
She's going!

01:04.356 --> 01:07.316
- Is that the doctor?
- It didn't take.

01:10.195 --> 01:15.366
Just tell me honestly
that you don't have feelings for Casey.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.785
I can't tell you what you need to hear.
It wouldn't be true.

01:18.912 --> 01:22.582
I'm sorry.

01:26.879 --> 01:29.630
- You want to stay.
- I can't go with you.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.971
- Renee.
- Hi.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.692
- What's up?
- Hey.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.987
Er, these are the last of the bills
we need to split up.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.490
Aw, that's sad.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.325
So how's the hunt for new digs going?

01:57.451 --> 02:01.996
Good, good. I mean, it will be.
I haven't really officially started yet.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.582
What? Shay, we have to be
out of there by the 15th.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.460
I know. I'll make it work.

02:07.586 --> 02:10.755
- Did you and Renee find a place yet?
- Closing in on one.

02:10.881 --> 02:14.425
It's got a perfect baby room,
right next to the master.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.844
Good.

02:19.097 --> 02:23.059
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

02:23.185 --> 02:27.605
You said the baby's, erm,
coming on Thanksgiving, yeah?

02:27.731 --> 02:29.357
Yeah.

02:29.483 --> 02:34.654
Well, it's just that, erm...
Renee left February 9th.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.283
So when was the last time you guys...

02:41.662 --> 02:43.204
February 9th.

02:44.623 --> 02:49.085
Exactly.
So... the due date should be

02:49.211 --> 02:51.838
the first week in November,
at the latest.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.428
Shay, look, look, look.
I know this sucks for you.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.764
You wanted to have a baby,
and I have one without you.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.684
- No, it's not about that.
- But it's not Renee's fault or mine.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.728
And for you to imply
that it's not mine...

03:12.150 --> 03:16.279
Tell you what, I'll handle these.
See you back at the house.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.463
How's the apartment hunt going?

03:34.590 --> 03:36.132
Oh, you know, better than telling Kelly

03:36.258 --> 03:38.342
I didn't think Renee's
due date added up.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.803
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah. You can imagine how he took it.

03:40.929 --> 03:45.099
And this has nothing to do with
you and a baby and her and a baby?

03:46.977 --> 03:48.644
I'm past all that, alright?

03:57.946 --> 04:01.240
- Good to be back?
- Better than good.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.041
Hey, we have
a two-and-a-half story fully involved.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.168
51, get a line in that basement,

04:12.294 --> 04:15.421
let's get a primary
search started immediately.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.173
Someone's inside.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.927
We'll vent the roof
and start in the basement.

04:21.053 --> 04:25.765
- We've got the main floor.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:25.891 --> 04:26.933
Do you smell...

04:31.146 --> 04:33.397
Cruz, Herrmann, Otis,
up the aerial to vent.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.817
- Candidate, we're in the basement.
- Hey, 51, follow us in with the light.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.487
- Capp, stay with me.
- Herrmann, Otis!

04:39.613 --> 04:41.238
A little help?

04:48.246 --> 04:51.582
- That smell's still here.
- Yeah. Diesel?

04:51.708 --> 04:52.708
Yeah.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.056
There's no one down here.
It's an inferno, Chief.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.934
- We're heading back the way we came.
- Copy that.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.144
Come on, let's go, go.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.816
Anybody in here?

05:19.152 --> 05:21.529
Hey, I got nothing.
Where is she?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.406
Check the hallway.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.493
Fire department. Call out!

05:27.619 --> 05:29.578
Anybody here? Call out!

05:46.471 --> 05:49.473
Mayday, mayday!
I'm trapped in the basement.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.225
Mouch, let's move.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.019
The stairs are gone.

05:53.145 --> 05:56.063
I need a charge,
one and three quarters at the stairs.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.530
Severide!

06:07.284 --> 06:09.243
- Severide!
- Down here!

06:10.954 --> 06:13.164
OK. Lower it down!

06:16.793 --> 06:19.920
- Alright, on!
- One, two, three, pull!

06:21.339 --> 06:23.424
Pull!

06:23.550 --> 06:26.218
Pull!

06:38.315 --> 06:40.024
Let's get him down.
You OK?

06:40.150 --> 06:43.652
Yeah, I'm OK, I'm OK.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.658
- Are you sure you're OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.584
There's no one in there, Chief.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.356
- What is it?
- 1751.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.275
That's my badge number.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.085
Sorry, Mari.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.504
We got a call.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.842
Oh, this is Mari!
What took you so long, Mouch?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.637
Mouch, it's a nickname. It's...

07:51.763 --> 07:54.598
- Welcome. We're so glad to have you.
- Thank you.

07:54.724 --> 07:59.395
Er, this is Otis.
This is Mills, Herrmann.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.314
That's Joe Cruz and Lieutenant Casey.

08:03.775 --> 08:06.443
This man has had a smile on his face
since the day you arrived.

08:06.570 --> 08:09.071
Come on, I'll show you around.

08:09.197 --> 08:12.741
Oh, er, Mills, Mari and I
are gonna make lunch today.

08:12.868 --> 08:15.327
- Say what?
- We're making butajiru.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.454
Bu... Butu what? OK.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.624
Hey, I'm not eating any raw fish.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.003
The Ashland Royals have started
tagging with numbers,

08:24.129 --> 08:25.880
could just be a coincidence.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.758
Has to be, right?

08:29.885 --> 08:31.677
We'll keep an eye out.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.391
- Hey, how was fishing?
- It was good.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.226
Jumping in the boat.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.145
Got my head cleared, so, er...

08:41.271 --> 08:43.898
- That's good, man.
- Yeah.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.276
- You seen Boden?
- Said he got called to Headquarters.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.695
Coffee or some water?
I'm sure I can get some...

08:49.821 --> 08:51.572
- Oh, here we go.
- Sorry I'm late.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.991
Please have a seat.

08:54.117 --> 08:57.203
I wanna thank you all for coming,
Chiefs.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.496
I know you're anxious
to get back to your firehouses,

08:59.623 --> 09:01.749
so I will keep this as brief as I can.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.292
My name is Gail McLeod.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.836
And I've been hired by
the State Fire Marshal's office

09:05.962 --> 09:09.924
to rein in the disbursement of state
money to the Chicago Fire Department.

09:10.050 --> 09:16.805
Now, I have been charged with creating
a more streamlined and automated CFD,

09:16.932 --> 09:20.142
and reducing expenditures by 10%.

09:20.268 --> 09:24.146
So, first we will be
installing and training you

09:24.272 --> 09:26.315
on a new system that
we're calling The Wizard.

09:26.441 --> 09:30.736
- The Wizard?
- I know, great name, right?

09:30.862 --> 09:35.866
But The Wizard will monitor things
like apparatus fuel efficiency,

09:35.992 --> 09:39.245
manpower distribution,
overtime approval.

09:39.371 --> 09:42.539
That alone will save
this department nearly 4% a year.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.125
Yeah, we save 4%,
but we lose the ability

09:45.252 --> 09:47.586
to make the best decisions for our men.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.050
What makes you think that you make
the best decisions, Chief?

09:56.012 --> 09:59.139
Have you ever run into
a burning building, Ms McLeod?

09:59.266 --> 10:01.058
Cos I was in one
less than an hour ago,

10:01.184 --> 10:03.352
where we barely saved one of our own.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.063
In fact, have you ever
grabbed a burn victim?

10:06.189 --> 10:08.565
Tried to pull him to safety,
but had the skin of his arm

10:08.692 --> 10:11.318
come off in your own glove?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.487
Cos I have.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.240
We all have.

10:22.789 --> 10:27.751
No, Chief.
I've never done any of that.

10:27.877 --> 10:32.298
But I do have to make
very, very difficult decisions.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.800
Like this morning
when I told Firehouse 33

10:34.926 --> 10:37.303
that it was closed, permanently.

10:38.388 --> 10:42.057
Now, to cover the additional 6%
that we do need to cut,

10:42.183 --> 10:46.395
I am going to have
to close down two more houses.

10:49.566 --> 10:53.610
You're here because
your house is on the shortlist.

11:01.578 --> 11:06.790
OK, erm, sign-ups for training
on the new software...

11:21.056 --> 11:23.474
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.392
- You OK?
- Yeah.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.896
Erm, Herrmann and Otis
are driving me crazy

11:29.022 --> 11:30.397
with this whole Game Day thing,

11:30.523 --> 11:32.608
and it would be really nice
to not talk about

11:32.734 --> 11:34.985
how we're all going down in flames,
so...

11:35.111 --> 11:37.821
Tomorrow night? I'll buy.

11:38.698 --> 11:42.493
- That'd be great.
- It's really good to have you back.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.374
Smells good.

11:51.836 --> 11:55.798
- Wow. That is amazing.
- I've never eaten so good.

11:55.924 --> 12:00.302
I come in, there's noodles, there's
rice, there's little chopped up fish.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.514
Holy mother, it is good.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.766
Wow.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.728
OK, everybody, listen up.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.648
The state of Illinois,
in all its wisdom,

12:12.774 --> 12:16.568
has brought in a consultant to make
recommendations on firehouse closures.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.488
- What?
- 51 is on that list.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.368
To be certain it doesn't happen here,
we are gonna tighten up,

12:24.494 --> 12:26.662
not give 'em a reason
to even look in our direction.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.789
- Does everybody understand?
- Meaning what, Chief?

12:28.915 --> 12:30.791
Meaning the trucks
and the gas will be monitored.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.292
No more side trips to get ice cream.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.754
You will also be required
to join a wellness programme,

12:35.880 --> 12:37.506
or you will pay higher premiums.

12:37.632 --> 12:38.715
This is insanity, Chief.

12:38.842 --> 12:43.095
Yeah, according to these wellness
doctors, I'm technically obese.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.931
The union's not gonna stand for this.

12:46.057 --> 12:49.726
Actually, I heard douchebag Greg
Sullivan is running for union president.

12:49.853 --> 12:54.064
- Who?
- I know him from bowling league.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.442
And let me tell you,
he's no fireman's fireman.

12:56.568 --> 12:57.651
He's a climber.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.028
Regardless,
we lock it down starting now.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.655
You got it, Chief.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.700
You're gonna have some new faces soon

13:04.826 --> 13:08.328
from the house
that's already been closed.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.372
Everybody keep an eye out.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.963
How's Casey?

13:18.089 --> 13:21.800
Erm, first I saw him was this morning,
but he looked better.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.178
And?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.472
- And?
- And?

13:27.515 --> 13:29.725
And he needs a friend.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.394
He needs something, alright.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.903
Hey!

13:43.323 --> 13:45.741
Hey. Multiple gunshot wounds.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.535
Get off me. Don't leave me here!

13:49.412 --> 13:51.538
Shay!

13:55.543 --> 13:58.378
Stop! Stop the car!

14:08.056 --> 14:09.890
Hey, hey, need some help here!

14:10.016 --> 14:12.434
On the ground!
Get on the ground!

14:12.560 --> 14:14.353
- Don't you move!
- He's circling.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.855
One, two, three, four bullet holes.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.149
Freeze!

14:19.275 --> 14:20.567
Try to get a line in.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.280
Hey.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.409
He's not breathing. I'm gonna tube him.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.459
I'm losing him. Starting CPR.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.136
Come on.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.643
Damn it!

15:00.567 --> 15:02.317
You couldn't have
walked him into the ER?

15:04.320 --> 15:05.988
Dawson, don't.

15:14.497 --> 15:15.664
Come on in.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.923
How you doing, Peter?

15:26.175 --> 15:28.093
- Fine, Chief.
- Good.

15:29.304 --> 15:30.679
Well, I just wanna make you aware,

15:30.805 --> 15:33.890
one of the new fire-fighters
coming over from 33...

15:36.102 --> 15:37.894
...he's gonna be joining Rescue Squad.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.608
Sounds good.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.156
Anything else?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.743
Nope.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.120
That'll be all.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.885
So what happened?

16:10.011 --> 16:13.722
Drive-by drop-off,
gurney completely destroyed.

16:13.848 --> 16:17.726
- Hey.
- How do you replace a gurney?

16:17.852 --> 16:21.396
- Er, we took one from Lake Shore.
- Oh.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.616
Hey, Renee, it's Kelly.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.368
Listen, erm...

16:36.621 --> 16:38.872
Give me a call
when you get a chance.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.957
Alright, love you, bye.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.757
Transfers from a closed house
is never good.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.342
They were closed for a reason.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.052
Do you really think 51 is in danger?

16:52.178 --> 16:54.763
We just gotta keep doing our jobs.
We'll be fine.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.852
Will you look at this?

17:01.062 --> 17:03.230
- Who's running against him?
- Unopposed.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.816
We deserve what we get then.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.196
Come in.

17:11.322 --> 17:12.948
- Hey, Heather.
- Hey.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.659
Just wanted to get a jump on these.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.703
- Here.
- Thanks.

17:18.496 --> 17:19.496
Hey.

17:23.501 --> 17:26.962
- How you doing?
- Ready for normalcy.

17:27.088 --> 17:30.298
Good. That's all you can
hope for right now.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.845
By the way, Thursday...

17:34.971 --> 17:36.847
Yeah, I know.

17:37.807 --> 17:41.017
- I can't believe it's been a year.
- Yeah.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.603
Sylvie and Shylah
are taking me out to happy hour,

17:43.730 --> 17:46.314
just to get my mind off of it.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.816
Good idea.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.360
We're going to Mclntyre's on Michigan,
if you wanna come.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.946
They already said
they plan on closing it down.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.073
I'm on shift.

17:55.199 --> 17:59.786
- But I'll definitely try to drop by.
- Thanks, Matt.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.789
- For everything.
- Andy would've done the same for me.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.420
Hey, breakfast is almost ready.

18:08.546 --> 18:09.921
How you doing?

18:10.047 --> 18:12.507
Hey, Griffin. How you doing?

18:14.051 --> 18:15.177
I'm not hungry.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.931
- Griffin Darden...
- I'm not hungry!

18:22.977 --> 18:26.146
Ah, it's the shirt.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.690
Anything related to
the fire department...

18:29.817 --> 18:32.652
I'm sorry.
I didn't realise you...

18:52.381 --> 18:55.383
I'm telling you guys,
we're going to get crushed.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.302
Your optimism is always inspiring.

18:57.428 --> 19:01.389
You know, my aunt, she used to be
this secret shopper for a company.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.683
She'd go in, completely anonymously,

19:03.810 --> 19:06.102
check on the customer service
and report back.

19:06.229 --> 19:07.229
And?

19:07.355 --> 19:10.690
We need a secret shopper
to go check out Game Day.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.656
- Yeah, good by me.
- Alright.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.324
Don't try to big dog it.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.701
Just go over there
like a normal customer.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.787
I know how to walk into a bar.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.791
- What?
- I'm not going out of pocket on this.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.253
Wow.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.840
I want an itemised receipt.

19:34.966 --> 19:39.803
Excuse me, do you guys accept
Game Day coupons?

19:46.310 --> 19:48.478
Keep your elbows up,
you'll get into a better flow.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.188
Hey, what's happening, Antonio?

19:50.314 --> 19:52.315
You know, staying out of trouble.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.734
Good man.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.319
Hey, we're good, right?

19:57.154 --> 19:59.030
You know, it didn't work out
between Gabby and I.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.116
Yeah, we're good.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.076
A little battle of the badges
is coming up.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.244
We'd be a good match.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.913
Unless you're fighting
for the CPD, of course.

20:08.249 --> 20:09.541
What's that mean?

20:11.836 --> 20:13.587
I saw your name on the applicant list.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.007
Yeah, that...

20:17.967 --> 20:19.759
I was in a bad place, man.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.636
Cool.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.471
It stays between us.

20:24.599 --> 20:25.891
You'd make a hell of a cop though.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.189
So, how was it?

20:33.316 --> 20:36.318
Fish were biting. It was, er...

20:36.444 --> 20:38.236
Thank you. It was a great idea.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.823
That was my dad's favourite spot.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.623
Hey, Matt...

20:49.749 --> 20:51.583
You know...

20:51.709 --> 20:54.628
You know there are
no expectations here, right?

20:55.838 --> 20:56.838
We're friends.

20:56.964 --> 21:01.259
Great friends. And I'm happy being
in your life as a friend.

21:07.725 --> 21:12.354
- You've always been there for me.
- Yeah. That'll never change.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.528
Thanks.

21:23.950 --> 21:27.410
I just want you to know,
I have had the best time.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.620
Best time.

21:30.623 --> 21:34.501
And I'll come to Osaka
as soon as I have furlough.

21:39.173 --> 21:43.009
In my culture, men with narrow eyes

21:43.135 --> 21:45.679
are destined to do great things.

21:47.264 --> 21:51.059
You are destined for greatness.

22:18.129 --> 22:22.132
Can I please send a couple Long Island
Ice Teas to the ladies in the corner?

22:22.258 --> 22:23.591
Long Island Ice Teas?

22:23.718 --> 22:27.470
What do you think this is,
spring break at Jersey Shore?

22:27.596 --> 22:30.140
15-year scotch is the answer.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.100
Is that right?

22:32.226 --> 22:34.394
I mean, admittedly, I don't know
about those girls,

22:34.520 --> 22:36.813
but most women prefer a man
who knows what to pour.

22:36.939 --> 22:39.357
Yeah?
What are they drinking now?

22:39.483 --> 22:42.694
Er...

22:46.157 --> 22:47.824
- Sea Breezes.
- That's what I thought.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.868
Three Long Island Ice Teas, please.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.245
Coming right up.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.088
We're open till 2:00.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.716
- Scotch?
- Scotch.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.636
- On me.
- No discount on that.

23:12.767 --> 23:15.977
- You got nothing to worry about.
- What do you mean?

23:16.103 --> 23:19.731
It's stale and bland and corporate.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.232
They put on a big show tonight,

23:21.358 --> 23:24.235
but tomorrow Game Days is gonna look
like another bad date with a hangover.

23:24.361 --> 23:27.614
- Yes!
- Yes, we're gonna be fine.

23:28.282 --> 23:30.700
Here. I forgot a receipt.

23:35.998 --> 23:38.166
Chop, chop, guys.

23:52.556 --> 23:55.600
Severide, we got trouble!
Get out here!

23:57.478 --> 23:59.312
Yo.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.564
- Your car!
- What the hell?!

24:27.216 --> 24:28.216
Totalled.

24:35.683 --> 24:39.102
You smell that? Same chemical.

24:39.228 --> 24:42.188
Yeah, now we know.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.606
Whoa.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.693
You guys make your own fires
around here, or...

24:47.653 --> 24:48.820
You must be the new guys.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.239
I'm Lieutenant Spellman,
this is Clarke.

24:51.365 --> 24:53.491
Wish it were under better circumstances.

24:53.617 --> 24:56.077
I'm Casey. This is Severide.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.913
- Nice to meet you.
- Jeff Clarke, sir.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.750
Clarke.

25:07.715 --> 25:10.175
We both smelled the same thing there
and at the Camaro.

25:10.301 --> 25:13.303
Come on in, Clarke.

25:13.429 --> 25:16.097
Pardon the interruption, sir,
but, erm, I found this on the car.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.683
What is it?

25:18.809 --> 25:23.771
That coil holds a Styrofoam cup
filled with something like brake fluid,

25:23.898 --> 25:25.732
er, sitting on an oxidiser.

25:25.858 --> 25:30.778
- It's a homemade accelerant.
- How do you know all this?

25:30.905 --> 25:32.947
I've seen it before.

25:43.125 --> 25:47.128
OK.
We bring in Arson Investigation and CPD.

25:54.011 --> 25:55.762
Who put these up?

25:55.888 --> 25:58.973
First watch?
They should be ashamed of themselves.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.725
Why don't you just run, Herrmann?

26:00.851 --> 26:03.394
I don't think that
I'm the electable type.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.608
Everyone come with me, please.

26:09.902 --> 26:16.491
OK. Step one of the cutbacks,
overtime pay has been suspended.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.201
Here we go.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.870
And we are gonna start
doubling up on lockers.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.705
They're gonna take out
that whole section

26:22.831 --> 26:25.959
and use it to store some of the
equipment from the closed Firehouse 33.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.126
Please don't ask me why.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.254
This has reached
a new level of absurdity.

26:29.380 --> 26:33.174
So now, you get to choose
who you wanna share with.

26:34.677 --> 26:37.053
Anyone but Cruz, I'm begging you.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.681
- I'll take Otis.
- He didn't mean that.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.142
On a more serious note,

26:43.269 --> 26:45.270
we have to reason
to believe that Kelly Severide

26:45.396 --> 26:47.438
has gotten the attention of an arsonist.

26:47.564 --> 26:51.776
I have been assured by CPD and Arson
Investigation that they are into it.

26:51.902 --> 26:56.364
But I expect extra vigilance in
the coming shifts from all of you.

26:56.490 --> 26:59.325
And finally,

26:59.451 --> 27:02.912
today marks one year
since we lost Andy Darden.

27:03.038 --> 27:07.125
Everyone hold a thought for him
and the family that he left behind.

27:07.251 --> 27:11.546
We are all a little less
without him in our lives.

27:17.511 --> 27:19.387
I'll leave you to it.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.239
You need something?

27:38.365 --> 27:40.700
No. No, I'm good.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.044
If anyone asks,
we saw a cat in a tree.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.795
Got it.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.012
Looks like
your wrecking crew right here.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.056
Matt. Thanks for coming.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.974
I only have a second.

28:05.100 --> 28:08.603
Right, Well, this is Sylvie, Shylah,
and Jen.

28:08.729 --> 28:11.522
Hi, nice to meet you.
Thanks for taking this one out.

28:11.648 --> 28:15.735
- Oh, she deserves it.
- Yeah. How you doing?

28:15.861 --> 28:17.904
- I'm doing just great.
- Good.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.364
Here you go, ladies.

28:19.490 --> 28:21.824
And I'm about to be
doing a whole lot better.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.327
Looks like you're in excellent hands.

28:24.453 --> 28:27.080
He's on duty, or else
I'd make him do shots with us.

28:27.206 --> 28:31.250
Next round's on me.
Make sure it's a celebration.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.919
Thank you.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.837
Alright, be safe.

28:35.464 --> 28:36.589
- OK?
- Yes, sir.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.091
See you, guys.

28:45.182 --> 28:48.267
See, no one will even know we were gone.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.186
Still and Box alarm,
building fire.

28:50.312 --> 28:52.688
Truck 81, Squad 3, Engine 51.

29:06.078 --> 29:09.288
My mother's on the fourth floor.
She says her chest is hurting.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.499
- Where?
- There.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.751
- We'll get her.
- Go.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.461
Ma'am, please.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.806
I got one.

29:31.145 --> 29:34.230
Hey, take the staircase up!
Get attack lines in here!

29:34.356 --> 29:38.234
Let's clear it!

29:50.622 --> 29:52.874
Let's get you out of here.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.250
I got him.

29:56.086 --> 29:59.547
- Hey, rooms are clear back there!
- Let's go upstairs.

29:59.673 --> 30:01.883
Let's send the water.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.564
That wind isn't good.

30:21.904 --> 30:24.822
- Fire's jumping, Chief.
- Damn it.

30:26.450 --> 30:30.453
Shay, Dawson, get out of there.
Evacuate the building right now.

30:31.747 --> 30:35.082
Pull her in, pull her in!

30:39.671 --> 30:40.796
I got her.

30:53.143 --> 30:55.978
Hey, Chief? No way we're going down
the stairs we came up.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.147
- Fourth floor.
- Hang tight. We're coming.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.526
Severide, Casey, Shay and Dawson
are trapped in building two.

31:01.652 --> 31:03.528
Can you see 'em?

31:05.781 --> 31:06.948
Got 'em, Chief.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.784
We've got an incapacitated
woman on a stair chair.

31:09.910 --> 31:10.952
She can't move.

31:18.794 --> 31:21.254
Fire's out in building one, Chief.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.757
Casey, we can't get the aerial in there
to pull 'em out.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.094
Mills, Otis, run a straight ladder up.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.595
Bring 'em across.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.222
Go.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.479
We gotta go.

31:44.278 --> 31:46.362
Here we go. Steady, Otis.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.245
Got it.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.457
Fire's coming through.

32:06.508 --> 32:08.968
Come to the window.
We'll get you.

32:46.048 --> 32:47.340
- Dawson.
- Yeah?

32:47.466 --> 32:48.841
You're up.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.109
Come on.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.571
You got it, Gabby.

33:11.698 --> 33:13.032
Give me your hand.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.163
OK, nice and easy, Shay.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.294
Fire's coming!

33:27.506 --> 33:29.215
Get me off this thing.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.842
Tie her to the line.

33:32.844 --> 33:36.097
Here comes the victim.
Keep the slack out of the line.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.863
Engine 51 moving into building two.

33:54.908 --> 33:56.075
There you go.

34:00.622 --> 34:01.831
Casey, move!

34:01.957 --> 34:05.334
Now! Come on, Casey! Let's go!

34:08.046 --> 34:09.171
Coming.

34:28.859 --> 34:29.942
Casey!

34:33.447 --> 34:34.864
Otis, Mills, pull!

34:46.543 --> 34:48.669
Pull.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.596
We gotcha.

35:00.807 --> 35:04.393
I'm OK.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.233
I'm OK.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.527
OK, everybody out, now.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.325
You two OK?

35:19.451 --> 35:22.328
A little well-done,
but we're alright, Chief.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.871
Here, hop on.

35:33.924 --> 35:36.050
Found two of these in the basement.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.940
An arsonist? What the hell?
Are you OK?

35:51.066 --> 35:53.234
Yeah, we'll find him.
We'll...

35:53.360 --> 35:58.113
- We'll find him.
- Alright.

35:58.240 --> 36:01.200
Look, Kelly, erm...

36:01.326 --> 36:03.369
I'm sorry about the Renee thing.

36:03.495 --> 36:07.373
And I'm sure
everything's on the up and up.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.670
Renee's visiting her parents.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.922
It's the last time
she can fly before the baby.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.925
I don't wanna get into it with her
on the phone, but...

36:18.051 --> 36:21.095
OK. OK, good.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.766
Alright, cool.

36:37.153 --> 36:40.823
Who's on pouch poop duty?
There's a few bombs in the back.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.951
Don't you dare look at me.

37:05.432 --> 37:08.726
Oh, my God.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.978
What?

37:32.292 --> 37:34.126
That's what
I'm talking about, baby!

37:35.962 --> 37:40.591
- Thanks a million, Judas.
- Guys, what do you want me to say?

37:40.717 --> 37:43.469
Game Day's incredible.
It's the best bar in Chicago.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.764
No, it's the single
greatest place on Earth.

37:52.979 --> 37:57.566
- You asked to see me, ma'am?
- Come in, come in. Please, have a seat.

38:01.655 --> 38:03.739
Hi, you are Jeff Clarke, yes?

38:03.865 --> 38:05.324
Yes, ma'am.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.409
And how are you liking
the fit at 51, Jeff?

38:07.535 --> 38:11.497
- I think it's a real good fit, ma'am.
- Good, good.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.791
Well, listen, I, erm...

38:13.917 --> 38:16.919
I pushed to get you promoted
from relief at 33

38:17.045 --> 38:19.213
to a permanent place on Squad at 51

38:19.339 --> 38:23.926
because I know you're a fireman
that a superior can count on.

38:25.345 --> 38:26.804
I'm sorry...

38:28.390 --> 38:32.351
I was hoping that you could be
my eyes and ears over there.

38:32.477 --> 38:35.020
It's nothing shady.
It's just a bit of a problem house.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.523
There are prescription drugs missing
off of an ambulance,

38:37.649 --> 38:39.441
there's a sexual harassment claim,

38:39.567 --> 38:42.861
all of which are
massive liability risks.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.697
I don't know anything about that,
ma'am.

38:44.823 --> 38:48.742
No, no, no.
I didn't expect you to.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.244
But it would be very helpful

38:50.370 --> 38:53.539
if you could just check in
with me once a week

38:53.665 --> 38:55.124
and let me know what's happening.

38:59.129 --> 39:04.299
In light of the fact that it would be
incredibly easy

39:04.426 --> 39:07.344
to put you back into a relief rotation,

39:07.470 --> 39:09.805
I would think that
you'd wanna help me out.

39:12.142 --> 39:15.144
So, like I said,
as a former military man

39:15.270 --> 39:20.024
who understands chain of command,
I'm hoping I can count on you.

39:30.952 --> 39:32.661
Chief.

39:32.787 --> 39:33.871
Mouch.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.418
Can I ask you something?

39:42.380 --> 39:44.590
Do I have narrow eyes?

39:50.430 --> 39:53.849
What answer do you wanna hear?

40:36.810 --> 40:39.770
- You were just in there!
- I tried to bring people over!

40:43.525 --> 40:45.692
Hey, guys.

40:45.819 --> 40:47.361
Hey!

40:56.621 --> 40:58.872
I would like to announce that I,
Randy McHolland,

40:58.998 --> 41:03.127
am running for union president,
and I would appreciate your support.

41:11.219 --> 41:14.805
Attaboy, Mouch.
That's the best news I heard all day.

41:18.184 --> 41:21.478
Truck 81, Ambulance 61,
single car accident,

41:21.604 --> 41:23.355
87 South Illinois.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.282
Affirmative, Central. CFD's on scene.

41:43.793 --> 41:46.753
DUI. The passenger's in
pretty bad shape.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.506
Head trauma, losing blood.
We gotta move fast.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.926
Where's the driver?

41:53.052 --> 41:55.846
They don't have
a father any more...

41:55.972 --> 41:59.516
Please tell them.
Please tell someone, please, God.

41:59.642 --> 42:00.976
- Heather?
- Matt!

42:01.102 --> 42:02.394
- Oh, God.
- What happened?

42:02.604 --> 42:05.314
Oh, God, the kids.
The kids are at the babysitter.

42:05.440 --> 42:08.859
I'll take care of...
I got it. I got it!

42:08.985 --> 42:11.028
Thank you.
