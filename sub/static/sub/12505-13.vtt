WEBVTT

00:07.375 --> 00:09.577
I'd like you all to welcome
the new head coach

00:09.610 --> 00:11.512
of The Rock,
Darby Conrad.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.748
I've decided that
your new team co-captains

00:14.782 --> 00:17.185
are Payson Keeler
and Lauren Tanner.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.720
- What did you do?
footage of Payson kissing him

00:19.753 --> 00:22.022
and I sent it to Ellen Beals.

00:22.056 --> 00:24.425
- I can help you
get out of here.
- I acknowledge that I'm sick.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.026
- Mrs. Kmet...
- No, Bambi!

00:26.060 --> 00:28.229
My name is Bambi.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.198
I don't wanna wait
to be with you.

00:30.231 --> 00:34.102
That is one thing that
I can give you right now.

00:37.105 --> 00:40.274
[girl] Payson, you're amazing.
You're so brave.

00:40.308 --> 00:42.543
You're the strongest athlete
I've ever seen.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.246
I really don't see
the point in this.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.647
[Darby] Since the dawn of time,

00:46.680 --> 00:49.183
women have gathered
in non-hierarchical circles

00:49.217 --> 00:51.219
to affirm and support
one another.

00:51.252 --> 00:54.355
They also bludgeoned each other
over the head with clubs.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.789
[girls chuckle]

01:03.764 --> 01:06.134
Yes, Payson sure knows
how to nail a vault.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.768
[under breath]
But that's about all.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.304
I'm here to mount the equipment,
not every boy in the gym.

01:10.338 --> 01:14.642
OK, ladies, this exercise is
about positive reinforcement.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.677
Lauren, why don't you
take a turn?

01:20.448 --> 01:24.452
OK, Emily, can you say something
nice about Lauren's gymnastics?

01:24.485 --> 01:26.320
What? Oh, um...

01:27.388 --> 01:29.590
You really know how
to strut your stuff.

01:29.623 --> 01:32.693
- Thank you.
- Like the runway at a
Victoria's Secret fashion show.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.595
OK, not really
a compliment, Payson.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.165
Actually,
in my world, it is.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.632
And that's the difference
between you and me.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.134
In addition
to my extreme hotness?

01:40.168 --> 01:42.670
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Girls, hold up.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.104
[sighs]

01:44.138 --> 01:46.640
New idea.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.710
What do you say we do
the "Learn My Routine" exercise?

01:49.743 --> 01:51.479
Excuse me, we don't have time
to screw around.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.647
We've got a team meet
with Dallas in a week.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.783
Exactly.
And there is no team

01:55.816 --> 01:58.652
without mutual
r-e-s-p-e-c-t.

01:58.686 --> 02:02.190
So, you will each learn
one of each other's routines.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.092
You will get inside
each other's bodies and minds

02:05.125 --> 02:07.094
and do everything
as the other does it,

02:07.127 --> 02:09.797
exactly the way she does it,
and in the process,

02:09.830 --> 02:13.667
develop respect for each other
gymnastically and otherwise.

02:13.701 --> 02:17.271
You two. I love it!
All right, girls, pair up.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.672
Fan-flippin-tastic.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.674
[Lauren] This is
gonna be a riot.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.743
Payson couldn't move like me

02:22.776 --> 02:24.878
unless she had ants in
her pants. Literally.

02:24.912 --> 02:28.216
Who am I
gonna be working with?

02:28.249 --> 02:29.850
[Darby] What's got two thumbs
and choreography

02:29.883 --> 02:32.220
that won the Pacific Coast
Classic in 2002?

02:32.253 --> 02:34.688
This gal!
[chuckles]

02:34.722 --> 02:37.491
- What?
- You can learn my routine.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.693
I was actually thinking
that I should

02:39.727 --> 02:41.695
spend some more time
on my own gymnastics.

02:41.729 --> 02:45.899
And I was thinking
that what you actually need
is a good role model.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.436
The NGO filled me in
on all the details of
your new contract, Emily.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.703
They want me
to keep an eye on you.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.872
- Great.
- Right?

02:51.905 --> 02:54.442
It takes a village
to raise a great gymnast.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.877
And I just want you to know,
I'm here for you, Em.

02:59.280 --> 03:04.184
In my family, I always felt
all this pressure to be perfect.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.687
I had perfect blonde hair,

03:06.720 --> 03:09.290
I ate perfect little meals
of nothing.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.692
I was thin,

03:11.725 --> 03:13.761
my parents were
so proud of me,

03:13.794 --> 03:15.463
and I loved it.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.765
That's why I existed,

03:17.798 --> 03:21.635
to be this perfect little
reflection of them in the world.

03:21.669 --> 03:25.739
And there are some days
where I still want to be
that perfect tiny blonde girl.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.409
Because everybody
loves that girl.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.778
Even though she was hungry.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.947
Those are the days
when I still want to restrict.

03:33.981 --> 03:38.819
Which means I'm still trying
to figure out why just being me,

03:38.852 --> 03:41.822
just like this, isn't OK.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.525
Thank you, Suzanne.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.927
Can anyone here relate

03:46.960 --> 03:51.265
to the struggle
with perfectionism
Suzanne just shared?

03:51.299 --> 03:52.433
Kaylie?

03:53.801 --> 03:55.403
Not really.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.353
I know who you are.
You're Kaylie Cruz.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.688
I'm a big fan. I love
gymnastics, your gymnastics.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.491
- All gymnastics.
- Thanks.

04:17.525 --> 04:20.994
Is it true that a lot
of gymnasts struggle
with eating disorders?

04:21.028 --> 04:24.632
People assume that.
People who don't know
anything about the sport.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.968
- [car radio]
- [honks horn]

04:28.001 --> 04:31.739
[gasps] What are you
doing in Boulder?

04:31.772 --> 04:33.607
I finally got sprung
from the bin,

04:33.641 --> 04:35.409
and thought I'd come check
on my little friend Kayliekins

04:35.443 --> 04:37.010
before I leave for Milan.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.613
Well, don't just stand there,
kitten! Get in!

04:39.647 --> 04:40.881
[starts engine]

04:40.914 --> 04:42.550
Where are we going?

04:42.583 --> 04:44.985
Saint-Germain-des-Pres
for pamplemousse macaroons.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.388
- What?
- Oh, you are so cute.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.690
I'd die. Seriously.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.760
Baby, it's time to shed
some of this rehab fat.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.662
[car radio continues]

04:56.697 --> 04:59.467
I don't know which of Darby's
big ideas is more stupid:

04:59.500 --> 05:01.469
Making you and me co-captains,

05:01.502 --> 05:03.504
or letting us come and go
as we please,

05:03.537 --> 05:06.374
or wasting our time
learning each other's routine

05:06.407 --> 05:07.541
before we have a club meet

05:07.575 --> 05:08.942
with the best team
in the country.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.379
You only think that Darby
lifting all the rules is stupid

05:11.412 --> 05:13.447
because you still approach
this sport as a little girl,

05:13.481 --> 05:14.782
not a grown woman.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.287
- [Lauren] Looking good, Max.
- [Max] Hey.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.622
Hey, yourself.
We were starting to think

05:21.655 --> 05:23.624
you changed your mind
about training at The Rock.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.725
Not a chance.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.027
Welcome.
We're glad you're here.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.796
Not that she'll notice.
Payson has no interest in boys,

05:28.829 --> 05:30.731
she's all gymnastics,
all the time.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.733
[Max] I doubt that.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.902
Nobody is one thing
all the time.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.670
I'll catch you guys later.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.709
- If I don't catch you first.
- Are you always in heat?

05:41.742 --> 05:44.044
[scoffing] Look,
I can't believe

05:44.077 --> 05:45.646
I'm saying this
to you of all people,

05:45.679 --> 05:47.948
but for the record,
I've got dibs on Max. OK?

05:47.981 --> 05:49.617
Are we in second grade?

05:49.650 --> 05:52.753
For the record,
I'm not interested
in him or any other boy.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.888
That's right. You're only
interested in middle-aged men.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.424
So no weirdness between us?

05:56.457 --> 05:58.792
No more than usual.

06:03.764 --> 06:07.768
What you just did,
the story you just told,
it was... it was inspired.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.771
It's you, Sasha,
you inspire me.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.141
Payson!

06:32.760 --> 06:35.563
Lauren, what did you do?

07:04.758 --> 07:08.562
[Kaylie] These things always
feel a little germy to me.

07:08.596 --> 07:12.399
I'll take germs over muffin top.
I gotta drop ten before Milan.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.534
Runway work?

07:13.567 --> 07:14.802
Editorial.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.905
Someone may be the new face
of Besos and Company,

07:17.938 --> 07:19.740
and it's between me
and Brooklyn Decker.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.976
Wow! You're really back
in the game.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.412
Umm, ticky-ticky,
tock-tock.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.515
An agent at Ford
the other day said,

07:27.548 --> 07:30.818
basically, if you get one
or two seasons out of a girl,
you're lucky.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.854
Gymnastics is like that, too.
There's a tiny window
of opportunity.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.156
And they're not even
letting me work out.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.525
If you're worried
about weight gain,

07:37.558 --> 07:38.859
I have this over-the-counter
asthma medication.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.028
Keeps me energized,
not munchie.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.763
I shouldn't risk it.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.533
- Once I'm back,
- Yeah. random drug testing.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.969
For now, I'll just have
to be large and in charge.

07:49.002 --> 07:53.206
So, what's the dealio
with Mr. Hot Stuff Gym Stud?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.809
Austin? No dealio.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.846
He's really freaked out
about this whole anorexic thing.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.113
I guess his sister
really did have

08:00.147 --> 08:01.749
an out-of-control
eating disorder.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.984
Hmm. How sad.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.887
Yeah.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.756
[sighs]

08:08.789 --> 08:11.925
Maybe it was a mistake
admitting that I had a problem.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.226
I mean, it got me
out of rehab,

08:13.260 --> 08:15.095
but now my parents
really think I'm sick.

08:15.128 --> 08:18.098
And they're buying every word
that the therapist says.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.834
Like that I'm gonna die
if I keep doing gymnastics.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.770
Easy peasy.
All you have to do

08:22.803 --> 08:24.905
is turn your parents
against the therapist

08:24.938 --> 08:26.473
and you'll be back
at The Rock...

08:26.506 --> 08:28.742
- [snaps fingers]
- ...like that.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.080
[jazzy dance music plays]

09:03.811 --> 09:05.846
[exhales] Whew!

09:05.879 --> 09:09.082
[chuckling] I don't remember
being out of breath

09:09.116 --> 09:10.851
when I did that routine
in Sydney.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.154
Of course I was 16,
and my life was a blur then.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.626
Can I ask you something?

09:18.659 --> 09:20.527
Do you ever feel like

09:20.560 --> 09:23.931
you missed out on being
a teenager, or being...

09:23.964 --> 09:25.966
What, in love?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.267
Lauren told me
you have a boyfriend.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.637
Had.

09:29.670 --> 09:34.608
I'm not allowed to have
a boyfriend or a life anymore.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.845
Which is ironic,
since you came here and
lifted all of The Rock rules.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.913
Listen, Em,
I didn't lift the rules

09:39.947 --> 09:42.783
because I thought having
boyfriends was a good idea.

09:42.816 --> 09:46.019
I lifted them because the
one thing this sport requires

09:46.053 --> 09:48.722
is absolute self-knowledge.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.157
I know.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.692
You've got to
get with it, girl.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.193
You're running out
of second chances.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.897
[soulful pop music plays]

09:56.930 --> 10:00.300
After the back flip,
I do a little body roll.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.704
I shake the booty
a little bit here.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.908
And then I greet
my subjects down there.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.943
And then...

10:09.977 --> 10:12.913
[scoffs]
...a perfect double twist.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.955
Your turn.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.000
- All steak. No sizzle.
- What?

10:33.033 --> 10:35.769
Congratulations. I've got more
sass in my little finger.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.037
They have penicillin for that.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.672
I'm just saying, you look
a little weak up there.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.107
I'm every bit
as strong as you.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.209
She-Ra, this isn't
about strong,

10:42.242 --> 10:44.277
this routine is about
ooh-la-la.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.414
[pop music continues]

10:49.983 --> 10:51.384
[mouths silently]

10:55.022 --> 10:57.858
So, enjoying the view?

10:57.891 --> 10:59.793
[Max] She's like a Vegas show.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.862
All she needs is a head dress
and a g-string.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.731
She's a little too
obvious for me.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.332
Oh, come on,
you wouldn't hit that?

11:06.734 --> 11:08.335
I thought you
had it for Payson.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.838
There's definitely
something special about her.

11:10.871 --> 11:14.107
- So?
- Since when did you turn
into Susie Matchmaker?

11:17.945 --> 11:19.246
Hello.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.815
I'm just sayin', my buddy Carter
got mangled by that girl.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.952
She's a Venus Flytrap.
She'll eat you alive.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.955
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were jealous.

11:27.988 --> 11:32.826
[sighing] Poor Payson.
She just doesn't have "it."

11:32.860 --> 11:33.994
I'm trying to teach her
my beam routine,

11:34.027 --> 11:36.329
but you can't teach someone
to be sexy.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.430
Or subtle.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.200
So Max, what do you
like to do for fun?

11:43.003 --> 11:46.740
OK, ankles,
knees, shoulders,

11:46.774 --> 11:49.242
crown of the head.
That's good, right?

11:49.276 --> 11:51.344
And Lauren says
I don't have "it".

11:51.378 --> 11:53.413
I'll show her "it".

11:56.149 --> 11:57.384
Crud!

11:57.417 --> 11:58.952
Don't let Lauren get to you.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.088
She does silly,
showgirl stuff.

12:01.121 --> 12:04.024
You don't need any of that.
You're Payson Keeler.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.059
You'll do OK without it.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.061
I've never aimed for "OK."

12:08.095 --> 12:11.464
Well, if you're interested,
I could help you help yourself.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.901
Do what?

12:13.934 --> 12:16.804
Not look foolish
trying to do Lauren's beam.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.874
And in the meantime,
maybe impress a certain
new guy in town.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.843
I'm not interested
in impressing your buddy Max.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.344
And I'm a serious gymnast
who doesn't need

12:24.377 --> 12:26.847
to shake her moneymaker
on the beam to get attention.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.782
Well, how about
to get gold medals?

12:28.816 --> 12:31.785
'Cause let's face it,
Lauren's got the best beam
in the country.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.253
Why, just because sex sells?

12:33.286 --> 12:35.055
Sort of.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.824
- Well, I'm not buying.
- You're not the customer.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.993
But hey,
if sexy scares you,

12:40.027 --> 12:42.329
you just go ahead
and do Lauren's beam your way.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.342
[door opens]

12:55.375 --> 13:00.180
Emily, where have you been?
It's a half hour past curfew.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.415
I walked the long way home.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.351
You know you're supposed
to come home straight
from practice, right?

13:04.384 --> 13:07.154
My entire life,
you don't care when I come home,

13:07.187 --> 13:09.122
and now I can't
go for a walk? Great.

13:09.156 --> 13:12.025
I am off to work
at the call center.
What are you looking at?

13:12.059 --> 13:14.227
Damon's web page.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.496
No communication, Emily.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.132
I'm not communicating.
I'm just seeing what he's up to.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.768
Why do you keep obsessing
over Damon's web page?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.004
I thought we agreed, out of
sight, out of mind was easier.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.438
Well, it's not.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.942
I said goodbye to him
and now I can't see him, ever.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.845
Everything seems like forever,
Emily, you're a teenager.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.413
So, my feelings
don't matter?

13:33.446 --> 13:35.248
You'd never even kissed
a boy until you met Damon.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.783
And then you went on,
what, like five dates?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.818
So I'm an idiot then,
obviously.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.188
You know, I really don't
appreciate this attitude.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.522
Do you think that this
is fun for me?

13:42.555 --> 13:45.893
We both signed that agreement
with the NGO.

13:45.926 --> 13:49.362
And now I'm trying to be
a responsible parent
because you asked me to be.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.432
So please, can you just
turn off your computer
and start studying.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.869
You have your home school
finals in two weeks.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.540
I'm sorry.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.143
I know that you miss Damon

14:03.176 --> 14:05.578
and I know that you two
care deeply for each other.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.314
But Emily,
you're so young,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.082
and you have so much
in store for you.

14:09.116 --> 14:12.052
I promise, in time,
you'll forget.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.489
[Alex]
So how do we fix this?

14:16.523 --> 14:19.192
I mean, she just
has to eat more.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.260
She shouldn't be
losing weight anyway.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.995
What she needs is more
upper body strength.

14:22.029 --> 14:25.865
Instead of fixing things,
why don't we check in

14:25.899 --> 14:28.235
with how Kaylie
is feeling today?

14:32.239 --> 14:34.241
[sighs] Well, um...

14:34.274 --> 14:36.576
I've been thinking a lot,

14:36.609 --> 14:39.546
about what that girl said.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.548
- Suzanne?
- [Kaylie] Yeah.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.883
Yeah, about
what Suzanne said.

14:43.917 --> 14:47.487
About always trying to
be perfect for their parents.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.889
And, um...

14:49.923 --> 14:54.627
I... I can actually
relate to that.

14:54.661 --> 14:58.331
Do you feel they played
a hand in your disorder?

14:58.365 --> 15:01.268
Hey, we didn't play a hand
in starving our daughter.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.335
In Kaylie's intake report,

15:02.369 --> 15:05.272
she noted that you put
a scale in the living room.

15:05.305 --> 15:08.241
It was Nationals.
I put it there as a reminder.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.177
A reminder that
she wasn't perfect?

15:10.210 --> 15:12.245
And that you disapproved
of her natural size?

15:12.279 --> 15:16.016
Weight management is critical
to success in this sport.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.219
But did that create
a safe home environment
for your daughter?

15:19.252 --> 15:23.223
I'll admit that the scale
was a bit extreme.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.392
But our home's
always been safe.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.427
I meant, emotionally safe.

15:27.460 --> 15:31.464
Everything I have ever done
has been to support her dream.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.166
This is all
she's ever wanted.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.003
Or is it all
you ever wanted?

15:36.036 --> 15:38.371
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I had my own athletic career.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.373
I fulfilled my dreams.

15:40.407 --> 15:45.512
Sometimes by focusing
so intensely on
our children's dreams,

15:45.545 --> 15:48.281
we're able to avoid
more serious issues

15:48.315 --> 15:50.483
in our marriage
or family dynamics.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.920
I'm not gonna sit here
and be blamed for trying
to be a good father, OK?

15:53.953 --> 15:54.921
Alex...

15:54.954 --> 15:56.689
Thanks for the session,
doctor.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.526
Oh, wait,
you're not a doctor.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.262
Thank you,
occupational therapist.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.176
[door shuts]

16:20.413 --> 16:21.448
What's that?

16:21.481 --> 16:25.318
A copy of the training video
you stole from The Rock.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.188
Did you go on my computer?
That is a violation
of my privacy!

16:28.221 --> 16:31.458
And what the hell do you think
taking this private video,

16:31.491 --> 16:34.327
altering it, and leaking it
to Ellen Beals was?

16:34.361 --> 16:38.265
Besides an unconscionable
violation of your friend
Payson's privacy?

16:38.298 --> 16:41.434
Not to mention that you used it
to ruin a man's career!

16:41.468 --> 16:44.371
I used it to get Sasha
out of The Rock which
is what you wanted.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.305
Not like this!

16:45.338 --> 16:47.174
What does it matter
how I did it?

16:47.207 --> 16:49.376
Because how you
did it was wrong.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.610
Since when do you care
about right and wrong?

16:50.643 --> 16:53.213
Was it right to tell me that
my mother didn't care about me?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.315
Or right that you were secretly
giving money to Emily Kmetko?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.050
And what about
blackmailing Marty

16:57.084 --> 16:59.252
and probably a hundred other
things I don't even know about?

16:59.286 --> 17:02.222
I got the job done.
We have a new coach
and you have Summer back.

17:02.255 --> 17:05.992
We both got what we wanted.
And your hands are clean.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.360
No, they're not.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.263
I promised Summer,

17:10.297 --> 17:11.764
with God as my witness,

17:11.798 --> 17:14.701
that I would never keep
anything from her ever again.

17:14.734 --> 17:18.205
Especially if I found out
who leaked this tape.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.572
So what's one more
broken promise?

17:19.606 --> 17:22.041
- [door shuts]
- Hey.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.611
I got fresh sea bass, and the
most amazing heirloom tomatoes.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.279
I thought I'd make
a caprese salad.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.048
Everything all right?

17:29.082 --> 17:31.351
Everything's awesome
now that you're here.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.356
[rock music plays]

17:41.261 --> 17:44.631
* She bursts out
onto the scene *

17:44.664 --> 17:48.401
* And she struts her stuff
for the magazines *

17:48.435 --> 17:51.704
- * She's tall, cool
and sophisticated *
- [knocking on door]

17:51.738 --> 17:53.340
* Walking the groove... *

17:53.373 --> 17:54.241
Come in.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.044
Hey. Dinner's gonna be
ready soon.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.579
- OK.
- What you listening to?

17:59.612 --> 18:03.350
Uh, just funk, house.
I don't know, whatever.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.617
I like to kick out the jams.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.786
Please, no dorky mom dance
tonight.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.256
Are you OK?

18:09.289 --> 18:14.060
Do you ever get tired
of being the mom-jeans mom?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.495
What?

18:15.528 --> 18:17.264
You know how when Chloe Kmetko
walks into The Rock

18:17.297 --> 18:19.199
in one of her
spandex things,

18:19.232 --> 18:22.669
and all of the gym dads
turn and stare at her
'cause she's so...

18:22.702 --> 18:23.803
Exposed?

18:23.836 --> 18:25.272
I was gonna say sexy.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.673
Is that what you think
is sexy?

18:27.840 --> 18:30.076
Other people do.
I don't know, I guess.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.778
It's just...

18:31.811 --> 18:35.282
It's like she just has something
inside, like a perfume.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.383
Lauren has it too.

18:36.416 --> 18:40.320
It's powerful.
It's sizzle.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.292
You don't have to be sexy
like Lauren.

18:45.325 --> 18:48.228
What you have
is pretty powerful too.

18:48.261 --> 18:52.131
Beauty, grace, integrity.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.401
But you didn't say
sex appeal.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.636
I know.
I know I'm pretty, Mom.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.539
I know that I can walk down
a runway in a fancy dress.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.874
I even know that I can do
a pretty dance in a leotard,

19:01.908 --> 19:04.811
but I'm just,
just not sexy.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.112
Not in that way.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.248
There's all kinds of sexy.

19:08.281 --> 19:11.818
It's OK. You don't have
to be good at everything.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.324
And these are not mom-jeans.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.660
In fact,
they drive your father wild.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.396
[groans]
That's so gross.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.332
Pork chops in five.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.782
- You ready?
- Just so we're clear.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.385
I'm not here because I'm the
least bit interested in Max

19:45.418 --> 19:47.287
or impressing any guy.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.390
I'm here because...

19:50.423 --> 19:51.724
...this sexy thing scares me.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.261
And I don't like to be scared.
Of anything.

19:54.294 --> 19:58.231
And, also, I'd like to wipe
that snarky self-satisfied smirk

19:58.265 --> 20:00.433
off of Lauren Tanner's
spray-tanned face.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.201
Got it.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.704
So go ahead,
give me Lauren's routine,

20:04.737 --> 20:06.839
with all the Lauren
va-va-voom.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.508
OK, you can't laugh.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.277
I won't laugh.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.444
I mean it. If you laugh,
I'm outta here.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.380
Aye-aye, co-captain.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.248
Very funny.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.417
Here. I think this will help.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.452
[dance music plays]

Show me what you got.

look like you should *

All the people say *

20:51.551 --> 20:53.586
* Love your style, girl *

20:53.620 --> 20:55.655
Fine. Just let it out.

20:55.688 --> 20:59.459
[chuckles] I have an idea.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.593
How about we
work off the beam.

21:00.627 --> 21:03.830
I want you to get in touch
with your own... essence.

21:03.863 --> 21:04.864
As long as it's legal.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.333
Have a seat.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.538
Have you ever thought
about what turns you on?

21:11.571 --> 21:13.873
- Nope. No, not legal.
- Close your eyes.

21:18.878 --> 21:19.912
Smell this.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.581
[groans]

21:21.614 --> 21:23.883
Interesting. You're
repulsed by vanilla.

It's too sweet.

Elegant, spicy,

21:30.790 --> 21:32.559
citrus.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.694
Does nothing for me.
What is the point of this?

21:34.727 --> 21:37.263
Sexy is about feeling pleasure
with all your senses:

21:37.296 --> 21:40.633
taste, touch, smell.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.536
Close your eyes.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.575
That one's nice.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.511
Cedar. Cedar makes you
feel pleasure.

21:51.544 --> 21:54.547
Good. Now focus all your energy
in your second chakra.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.048
- Where?
- Just below your navel.

21:56.082 --> 22:00.587
This center holds your
basic need for sexuality,

22:00.620 --> 22:03.490
creativity and self-worth.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.958
Oh, so you're saying
my self-worth is in my bowels?

22:05.992 --> 22:08.561
Have you ever noticed
where Lauren holds her energy?

22:08.595 --> 22:10.963
It's all below the waist,
free and flowing.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.565
It's free all right.

22:12.599 --> 22:16.636
Walk across the room
like Lauren,

22:16.669 --> 22:19.506
centered in your sexuality.

22:20.707 --> 22:23.876
The key is to let
your hips be a little lazy,

22:25.111 --> 22:26.846
a little soft.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.649
Soft and lazy? That's totally
antithetical to gymnastics.

22:32.985 --> 22:33.986
Get down on all fours.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.523
- Now what are we doing?
- Cat energy.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.657
Every woman has some.

22:37.690 --> 22:41.327
The key is to get
out of your head.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.862
Come on, be a cat.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.803
[meows]

22:50.837 --> 22:53.072
[meows loudly]

22:54.474 --> 22:58.778
[continues meowing]

22:58.811 --> 23:00.480
- [hisses]
- Austin, I'm sorry.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.614
Thank you so much
for doing this with me,

23:01.648 --> 23:04.116
but it was
clearly a mistake.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.085
Come on,
you didn't even try.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.020
I know. I know
that I may think too much,

23:08.054 --> 23:10.089
I know that I may
be too focused.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.891
And that may be my curse.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.893
Boys may never think
that I'm sexy,

23:13.926 --> 23:16.563
and Lauren
may kick my ass on Friday,

23:16.596 --> 23:20.032
and that may just be something
that I have to live with.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.901
And how me liking
the smell of cedar

23:21.934 --> 23:26.906
has anything to do
with any of this,
I have no idea.

23:26.939 --> 23:30.543
Cedar is traditionally
used for purification.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.979
You respond to it
because you're pure of heart.

23:33.012 --> 23:36.415
[scoffs] This routine has
nothing to do with my heart!

23:38.618 --> 23:40.787
So, Maeve,
was there any concern

23:40.820 --> 23:43.523
about going back to work
so soon after...

23:43.556 --> 23:45.925
Rehab? [chuckles]

23:45.958 --> 23:48.695
No, ma'am. I acknowledged
I had a problem

23:48.728 --> 23:52.532
and that I'm committed to
recovery and my folks trust me.

23:52.565 --> 23:55.502
They understand that now is my
time to make it big as a model.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.637
If I let it slip away,
I'll miss my chance.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.839
It's the same thing
with gymnastics, actually.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.474
But my therapist
doesn't get that.

24:01.508 --> 24:04.410
In fact, he thinks our
whole family is screwed up.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.745
He's not even a real doctor.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.648
As a model, there must be
intense pressure

24:08.681 --> 24:10.517
to stay rail thin.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.653
Have you ever considered
doing something where maybe
size isn't an issue?

24:13.686 --> 24:17.056
Well, in our society,
size is always an issue.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.991
I mean, look at you.
You're not a model

24:19.025 --> 24:22.995
but you're very tiny
and perfectly put together.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.731
It's not just
a professional hazard.

24:24.764 --> 24:27.199
Every woman feels
pressure to be perfect.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.101
Not to the point
of starving herself.

24:29.135 --> 24:33.005
Agreed. But you can be healthy
and still strive for excellence.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.674
Like Kaylie.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.710
She has the talent
to do something extraordinary,

24:37.744 --> 24:39.812
and I'd hate to see
some therapist

24:39.846 --> 24:42.649
who's trying to justify
his job rob her of that.

24:42.682 --> 24:43.850
I agree completely.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.685
They have to make you think
you're screwed up

24:45.718 --> 24:48.655
so you keep coming back
and you keep writing checks.

24:48.688 --> 24:51.991
Quite frankly, I don't see
any reason why Kaylie can't
start training again.

24:52.024 --> 24:54.961
Maybe we can discuss this
in private?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.929
Fine. We'll discuss it.

24:56.963 --> 24:59.832
But I'm not gonna sit back
and let anyone rob Kaylie
of her dream.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.674
[Lauren] That was delicious.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.577
How many women
are gorgeous and can cook?

25:10.610 --> 25:12.078
I don't know how we ever
lived without you, Summer.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.746
But luckily, now,
we don't have to go back

25:13.780 --> 25:15.548
to those dark days
ever again.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.016
Right, Daddy?

25:23.556 --> 25:26.092
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- What?

25:26.125 --> 25:27.594
Whatever's making you
look like you have

25:27.627 --> 25:29.195
the weight of the world
on your shoulders.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.530
I've just been
thinking about

25:31.564 --> 25:34.500
all the mistakes
I've made with Lauren.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.102
You're supposed to teach
your children the difference

25:36.135 --> 25:39.038
between right and wrong.
Be an example.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.708
I failed to do both.

25:41.741 --> 25:44.844
It's never too late to teach
your children the right values.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.213
So, let's say they've
done something wrong.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.749
You can't spank a teenager.

25:49.782 --> 25:52.585
And I know grounding
does no good at all.

25:52.619 --> 25:53.686
How do you punish them?

25:53.720 --> 25:56.789
At this age,
the real punishment

25:56.823 --> 25:59.692
is to make them accountable
for their actions.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.728
So if they've done
something wrong,
they have to make it right,

26:01.761 --> 26:03.696
whatever the consequences.

26:03.730 --> 26:07.600
You always seem to know
exactly what to do.

26:07.634 --> 26:09.669
How are you
so crystal clear?

26:09.702 --> 26:11.904
About everything?

26:11.938 --> 26:13.940
Prayer helps.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.609
But I also believe
in our hearts,

26:16.643 --> 26:18.611
we all know what's right.

26:18.645 --> 26:21.714
It's just having
the courage to do it.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.924
[door opens, closes]

27:12.999 --> 27:15.601
[Payson]
Now I do a full-in.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.370
That's great, Lauren.
Stretch it out.

27:18.404 --> 27:22.074
Nice swing, and stick it.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.045
Payson, you're a great coach.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.915
You got her to open her shoulder
angle with a set drill, right?

27:28.948 --> 27:30.349
Yeah, I thought that that
would help her

27:30.382 --> 27:32.084
with the lift into
the second flip...

27:32.118 --> 27:34.153
[sighing] Hi, Max!

27:34.186 --> 27:35.722
- You look strong.
- Strong's easy.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.323
It's teachable.
Unlike sexy,

27:37.356 --> 27:39.258
which you're either
born with or not.

27:39.291 --> 27:42.061
Speaking of not, Payson, how's
my beam routine coming along?

27:42.094 --> 27:43.329
I'm about 90 percent there.

27:43.362 --> 27:46.098
Well, maybe it's time
to go all the way.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.100
Oh, whoops,
I forgot, you don't.

27:48.134 --> 27:51.303
Max, you want to see the new
pommel trainer we just got?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.639
Hey, Payson,
don't listen to her.

27:53.672 --> 27:54.907
You are sexy.

27:54.941 --> 27:57.744
I think we very well established
last night that I'm not sexy,

27:57.777 --> 27:58.878
so spare me.

27:58.911 --> 28:01.647
You're just
a quiet kind of sexy?

28:01.680 --> 28:04.016
One of these days you'll
wake up and see it.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.352
It wasn't my job
to push you into it.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.088
I asked for your help.
It's not your fault that
I can't pull it off.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.923
Pure of heart
is plenty sexy.

28:10.957 --> 28:12.391
I've noticed the kind
of girls you like

28:12.424 --> 28:15.227
and it's not their hearts
you're interested in.

28:15.261 --> 28:17.229
What about Kaylie?
I liked Kaylie.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.866
It wasn't for her long legs
and double D cups.

28:19.899 --> 28:22.034
So, "liked," past tense?

28:23.235 --> 28:25.104
Kaylie needs to focus
on healing right now.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.406
The further away she stays
from here and me, the better.

28:27.439 --> 28:28.440
[door opens]

28:30.709 --> 28:33.079
She obviously doesn't agree.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.883
I didn't know
she was back.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.350
Neither did I.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.086
Good job.

28:42.121 --> 28:43.322
Is that who I think it is?

28:44.356 --> 28:47.059
Kaylie Cruz,
National Champion?

28:47.093 --> 28:48.828
- Hi, Darby.
- [chuckles]

28:48.861 --> 28:51.230
[sighs] How are you?

28:51.263 --> 28:53.299
Great. Really great.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.401
Great! So when
are you coming back?

28:55.434 --> 28:58.137
Any day now. And maybe
even as soon as tomorrow.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.272
Tomorrow? Really?

29:00.306 --> 29:04.176
Yay! I can't wait to have
all my babes ready to crush!

29:04.210 --> 29:06.879
Oops. I better
get back to work.

29:08.514 --> 29:11.717
Austin,
this is my friend Maeve.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.720
Well, the Corso Como
has handsome ragazzi,

29:14.753 --> 29:16.422
but they don't have
the likes of you.

29:16.455 --> 29:19.125
Maeve's a model. She's catching
a plane to Italy tonight.

29:21.227 --> 29:24.030
Did your doctors clear you
to start training again?

29:24.063 --> 29:26.365
Well, I'll leave you
lovebirds to duke it out.

29:26.398 --> 29:30.970
I just wanted to see
the inside of the infamous Rock.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.504
See you outside.

29:35.407 --> 29:36.775
Not that it's any
of your business,

29:36.809 --> 29:39.378
but the only people I need
permission from are my parents.

29:39.411 --> 29:42.014
And they're on my side.
At least my dad is.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.817
The battle's not between me
or your parents, Kaylie.

29:44.851 --> 29:47.186
Stop trying
to be a hero, Austin.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.354
You first.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.223
[Lauren] Kaylie!
You're back!

29:54.093 --> 29:55.127
Hi.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.332
Hey. Sorry about that.

30:00.366 --> 30:02.268
I had to say hi
to everyone.

30:02.301 --> 30:05.938
No worries, doll face.
I gotta skedaddle anyway.

30:05.972 --> 30:07.406
But hey, Austin.

30:07.439 --> 30:10.342
Major dreamy.
And totally into you.

30:10.376 --> 30:14.280
Totally into saving me, maybe.
But that's about it.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.815
Nope. He's the real deal
lemon peel.

30:16.849 --> 30:18.384
Don't let him get away.

30:18.417 --> 30:21.187
I don't have time
for boys anyway, so...

30:21.220 --> 30:23.890
I know! You gotta get back here
training. You are such a star.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.325
[chuckles] So are you, Maeve.

30:26.358 --> 30:29.028
Please, my job
is to be a human hanger

30:29.061 --> 30:30.329
and remember to breathe.

30:30.362 --> 30:33.432
But what you do,
this is real.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.167
This is talent.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.537
Stay in touch, OK?

30:38.570 --> 30:40.506
Mm-hm.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.476
I am just one
international call away.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.813
You ring me any time,
day or night for support.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.883
- OK?
- OK.

30:59.558 --> 31:02.328
[starts engine]

31:10.502 --> 31:13.172
[hard rock music plays]

31:17.609 --> 31:18.877
You OK?

31:18.911 --> 31:21.447
Sure, why wouldn't I be?

31:21.480 --> 31:23.849
I don't know. You seemed
surprised to see Kaylie.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.418
I'm just surprised
she thinks she's ready
to start training again.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.187
Maybe she is.

31:30.422 --> 31:33.459
What about you? You ready
to do Lauren's routine?

31:33.492 --> 31:36.228
- I think I am.
- What changed?

31:36.262 --> 31:38.530
I just thought of all
the things I've been scared
to do as a gymnast.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.232
And I've tackled them
all the same way.

31:40.266 --> 31:44.070
I study every aspect
of the move, and I execute it.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.372
Every move in gymnastics
is learnable.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.474
Every single one.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.443
I don't have to prove to the
world I'm sexy to do her beam.

31:51.477 --> 31:53.312
- I just...
- You just have to be Lauren.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.581
Bingo. It's a performance,
just like anything else.

31:55.614 --> 31:59.318
You're gonna attack sexuality
with military precision?

31:59.351 --> 32:01.320
Kind of.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.022
And in the process, who knows
what you might discover,

32:03.055 --> 32:05.357
- hidden deep down inside...
- My second chakra?

32:05.391 --> 32:07.393
Don't hold your breath.

is Bambi working today?

32:25.511 --> 32:27.546
Uh, no. That's OK.

32:27.579 --> 32:31.117
Can you tell me what sort
of establishment this is?

32:33.252 --> 32:34.386
Thank you.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.656
What's wrong?

32:37.689 --> 32:39.525
I have to go.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.660
You can't. We're doing
each other's routines
in a little while.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.696
Well, Darby said we can
come and go as we please,
so I'm going.

32:47.433 --> 32:51.170
OK, you have one more hour
to polish up your routines,

32:51.203 --> 32:52.971
so use it wisely!

32:54.340 --> 32:57.943

Hey, have you seen Emily?

all of this, honey.
- Explain what?

33:39.017 --> 33:41.187
That you're working
in a frickin' strip club?

33:41.220 --> 33:43.289
Is this your idea of being
a responsible mother?

33:43.322 --> 33:46.358
It's a job, Emily.
And I am being responsible.
I'm putting food on the table.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.260
It is not just a job.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.761
It's another reason
why I'm not good enough.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.698
It's another piece of
a consistently embarrassing life

33:52.731 --> 33:54.733

34:15.421 --> 34:18.224
[chuckles]
Lauren, you first?

34:18.257 --> 34:19.325
Ready to rock it!

34:19.358 --> 34:21.527
Here I go. With the strong
and impressive,

34:21.560 --> 34:23.562
but no-frills bars
of Payson Keeler.

34:34.573 --> 34:37.176
[rock music plays]

34:57.796 --> 35:00.432
[crowd cheers]

35:02.168 --> 35:04.203
Very nice, Lo-Lo.

35:04.236 --> 35:07.773
And now, Payson, are you ready
to show Lauren's beam routine?

35:07.806 --> 35:09.508
Where's Payson?

35:09.541 --> 35:10.576
Don't tell me
she bailed too?

35:11.677 --> 35:13.679
[rock music plays]

35:17.816 --> 35:21.353
* She bursts onto the scene

35:21.387 --> 35:25.191
* And she struts her stuff
for the magazines *

35:25.224 --> 35:26.625
I told you.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.563
* Walking the groove
Syncopated *

35:31.597 --> 35:33.365
* She's the It girl

35:33.399 --> 35:35.201
* So plain to see

35:35.234 --> 35:38.470
* And we all want to play
just like her *

35:38.504 --> 35:42.174
* She may be overrated

35:42.208 --> 35:44.643
* Though one thing's for sure

35:44.676 --> 35:47.846
* She's so opinionated

35:47.879 --> 35:51.483
* So very complicated

35:51.517 --> 35:55.554
* She's got the whole world

35:55.587 --> 35:57.556
* She's the latest It girl

36:00.526 --> 36:03.161
[applause]

36:03.195 --> 36:06.565
* I want to play
just like her *

36:06.598 --> 36:09.868
* She may be overrated

36:09.901 --> 36:12.404
* But one thing's for sure

36:12.438 --> 36:15.707
* She's so opinionated

36:15.741 --> 36:18.477
* So very complicated

36:19.645 --> 36:22.581
* She's so opinionated *

36:25.884 --> 36:28.254
[gasps] Very nice, Payson.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.756
You really tapped
into something.

36:30.789 --> 36:33.592
A very successful
exercise!

36:33.625 --> 36:35.594
Maybe you should re-learn
your routine...

36:35.627 --> 36:38.397
- ...from Payson.
- [scoffs]

36:38.430 --> 36:41.567
Maybe you should go look
at yourself in the mirror
some more, yeah?

36:41.600 --> 36:43.369
[both chuckle]

36:46.272 --> 36:47.406
Nice chakra work.

36:47.439 --> 36:48.940
I can't believe
I just did that.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.443
I mean, at first I was just
being Lauren, and then...

36:51.477 --> 36:53.312
You became Payson:
sex goddess.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.946
Oh, God. Was it awful?

36:54.980 --> 36:56.782
If by awful,
you mean smokin' hot.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.618
Well, my work here is done.

37:01.420 --> 37:04.456
So... what are you doing
after practice?

37:04.490 --> 37:06.592
I hear there's this
awesome juice joint around here.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.327
Actually, I need to go
see a friend.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.462
OK, sure. No worries.

37:10.496 --> 37:12.631
But maybe you can
call me later?

37:12.664 --> 37:14.800
I will definitely
call you later.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.902
- OK?
- OK.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.380
- Please tell me that's
a music mix for Summer.
- Guess again.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.516
- You're not giving
that DVD to her.
- Yes, I am.

37:30.549 --> 37:32.351
- Dad, you can't!
- Watch me.

37:35.321 --> 37:36.622
What are you doing?

37:36.655 --> 37:39.224
I am doing what I should've
done long ago.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.793
I'm delivering the full tape
of Sasha and Payson

37:41.827 --> 37:44.830
- and making this right.
- No! And what about me?

37:44.863 --> 37:46.565
You should have
thought of that

37:46.598 --> 37:49.368
when you started
manipulating your coach,

37:49.401 --> 37:51.503
your teammates, and me.

37:51.537 --> 37:53.472
But Daddy, you can't!

37:53.505 --> 37:55.441
If you turn that in,
if you tell them it was me,

37:55.474 --> 37:57.943
I could be kicked out
of the gymnastics world.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.446
And Sasha will come back,
and Summer...

38:00.479 --> 38:02.648
I promised Summer
I'd tell her the truth.

38:02.681 --> 38:05.517
No! But she doesn't
need to know.

38:05.551 --> 38:07.719
You've already
taken away one mother.

38:08.654 --> 38:09.921
Please don't take away another.

38:11.323 --> 38:13.559
Daddy, please.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.594
You're all I have
left in the world.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.729
You and my gymnastics.

38:19.465 --> 38:21.767
This will ruin me!
Is that what you want?

38:23.301 --> 38:25.537
No, I don't wanna ruin you.

38:25.571 --> 38:28.507
But you ruined someone else,
Lauren. Do you understand?

38:28.540 --> 38:30.509
I'll never do it again!
I swear.

38:30.542 --> 38:32.578
Can we just let this pass?
Please.

38:32.611 --> 38:36.014
You're turning over
a new leaf and I can too.

38:36.047 --> 38:39.951
I promise you,
I promise I can.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.391
But we can't do this anymore.

38:45.424 --> 38:46.892
We won't have to.

38:46.925 --> 38:49.395
I learned my lesson.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.930
I really did.
I love you, Dad.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.034
[whimpering]

38:56.067 --> 38:58.670
- I'm so sorry.
- OK.

38:58.704 --> 39:01.473
- [whimpers]
- OK.

39:01.507 --> 39:03.509
So you think
this is all my fault too?

39:03.542 --> 39:05.811
I ruined our marriage,
I ruined our daughter.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.514
We are both responsible
for our marriage.

39:08.547 --> 39:11.316
And we are both responsible
for what happened with Kaylie.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.385
At the very least,
for not seeing it sooner

39:13.419 --> 39:14.920
and doing something
about it.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.856
And I never told you this,

39:17.889 --> 39:21.493
but I found
a trash bag of food

39:21.527 --> 39:22.894
in Kaylie's gym bag.

39:22.928 --> 39:25.831
Food that she was obviously
just pretending to eat.

39:25.864 --> 39:28.600
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Would it have really mattered?
Would you have listened?

39:28.634 --> 39:30.802
You're not even listening
to the therapist.

39:30.836 --> 39:33.539
Hey. I'm glad you guys
are here.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.607
I wanted to talk about
when I can start training.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.008
I was hoping tomorrow?

39:38.444 --> 39:39.811
Uh, yeah, we have
talked about it.

39:39.845 --> 39:44.950
We've decided that we will
trust the therapist for now.

39:44.983 --> 39:48.119
But my therapist is wrong.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.521
You said so yourself.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.022
Kaylie, you admitted
you have a problem.

39:51.056 --> 39:54.860
I lied, OK? I would have
said anything to get out
of that place.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.862
I don't have a problem!

39:56.895 --> 39:58.564
You guys are the ones
with the problem!

39:58.597 --> 39:59.965
You're ruining my career!

39:59.998 --> 40:01.533
I am gonna lose everything,

40:01.567 --> 40:04.536
if I don't get back
to the gym, right now!

40:07.138 --> 40:08.840
I know you don't understand.

40:08.874 --> 40:11.877
Your world
is nothing like mine.

40:13.679 --> 40:17.148
You don't have the NGO breathing
down your neck all the time,

40:17.182 --> 40:20.151
and then, whoopsie, your mom
forgot to tell you she was
working at a strip bar.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.488
Everything I've worked for,

40:22.521 --> 40:24.623
being an Olympian,

40:24.656 --> 40:27.058
being the best...

40:27.092 --> 40:28.827
...is always
about to fall apart.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.597
I know you don't want to
hear this right now, Emily.

40:33.031 --> 40:35.534
But you're not that different
from the rest of us.

40:35.567 --> 40:38.136
I see my dad once a month,

40:38.169 --> 40:39.671
because he's in
another state

40:39.705 --> 40:41.507
working to pay for
my back surgery.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.510
Kaylie can't even step
on a mat right now.

40:44.543 --> 40:46.111
She'd kill
to be able to train.

40:46.144 --> 40:47.946
- That's different.
- Is it though?

40:47.979 --> 40:51.717
Pain is pain, Emily.

40:51.750 --> 40:55.821
And we're all giving up things
for this dream.

40:55.854 --> 40:58.557
And until you accept
that those things,

40:58.590 --> 41:00.792
your mom,
the NGO, whatever,

41:00.826 --> 41:03.495
are things that
you can't control,

41:03.529 --> 41:06.097
that the only thing you can
control is getting to practice

41:06.131 --> 41:08.967
and always just
giving it your all,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.703
you really are
going to fall apart.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.513
I had sex with Damon.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.518
And I'm in love with him.

41:27.686 --> 41:29.120
Then why are you so sad?

41:29.154 --> 41:31.222
Because...

41:33.024 --> 41:35.827
I want my dream too.

41:35.861 --> 41:38.697
And I know
that I can't have both.

41:39.565 --> 41:42.568
Which do you want more?

41:45.537 --> 41:47.939
I want to go
to the Olympics.

41:47.973 --> 41:51.677
But what if I don't make it
and then I lose Damon?

41:51.710 --> 41:55.246
I just don't know that this
all would've been worth it.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.783
You can't drain your energy

41:57.816 --> 42:02.520
constantly thinking about all of
these possible future what-ifs.

42:02.554 --> 42:07.559
You have to focus your mind
on what you want to happen.

42:09.661 --> 42:10.796
You know what I want?

42:12.197 --> 42:15.266
I want to go
to the Olympics.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.869
And I want to do it with you
right there by my side.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.641
I want that too.

42:22.674 --> 42:25.811
- Come here.

[woman] Hello?

42:46.798 --> 42:49.901
Who is this?
Is this Maeve Benson's phone?

42:49.935 --> 42:51.569
Yes, it is.
Who is this?

42:51.603 --> 42:54.239
Uh, it's a friend of hers.
It's Kaylie.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.642
Is she there?
Can I please speak to her?

42:56.675 --> 42:57.709
Maeve...

42:59.010 --> 43:00.345
Maeve passed away.

43:02.080 --> 43:05.250
What? How?

43:05.283 --> 43:07.218
I... I just saw her!

43:09.320 --> 43:12.323
She had a heart failure
in the Denver airport.

43:13.859 --> 43:15.593
She's gone.
