This man won't let me in.
He's one of them, you know.

03:35.447 --> 03:38.518
- One of whom?
- The tribe. The Jews.

03:40.687 --> 03:42.553
Athena, nobody is trying
to stop you

03:42.555 --> 03:44.489
from going into the library
when we open,

03:44.491 --> 03:48.059
but the Jews have nothing
to do with it.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.861
I get it.

03:49.863 --> 03:53.731
You're Jewish too.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.501
Athena, keep this up,
and I promise

03:56.503 --> 03:58.903
you will not be allowed back
in the library for six months.

03:58.905 --> 04:02.843
- Is that what you want?
- No, no, no. I don't want that.

04:05.011 --> 04:06.144
Morning.

04:06.146 --> 04:09.080

Ten minutes.

- Good morning, Mr. Anderson.
- Mr. Goodson.

04:30.905 --> 04:33.638
Why is there a polar bear
in the library, sir?

04:33.640 --> 04:36.175
The Natural History Museum
is under renovation temporarily.

04:36.177 --> 04:39.911
I asked if we could house
part of their collection.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.882
Say hello to Beary White.

04:42.884 --> 04:45.550
Hello, Beary.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.920
When, uh,

04:47.922 --> 04:50.055
when you have a moment,
I need to speak to you.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.424
I have a moment right now.

04:53.895 --> 04:56.396
Board of trustees room, noon.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.807
- I'm not late.
- Uh-huh.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.576
- I'm not!
- Myra time.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.544
It's metro time.
The public transportation

05:13.546 --> 05:15.480
in this city
runs like a broken clock.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.815
You make enough money
to buy a car.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.549
Right, I can be like every other

05:18.551 --> 05:19.517
self-centered individual,

05:19.519 --> 05:22.755
that just wants to drive
all over the country

05:22.757 --> 05:23.989
and ruin the environment

05:23.991 --> 05:26.758
and not care about
their carbon footprint.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.494
You're so fashionably green.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.465
I'm committed
to doing my part, Stuart.

05:33.801 --> 05:34.833
What about you?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.068
Posting a meme on Facebook

05:36.070 --> 05:37.669
doesn't make you
an activist, Myra.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.005
Besides, it's not like
I drive to work in an SUV.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.572
You still drive to work

05:41.574 --> 05:44.876
when there's adequate
public transportation.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.246
Which gets you to work late
every day.

05:47.248 --> 05:49.814
So says you.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.550
You've seen our new polar bear?

05:51.552 --> 05:53.154
Kind of hard to miss.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.223
I think it's rather appropriate,

05:58.225 --> 06:01.026
because I think
we are the new polar bear.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.996
Me, you, everyone,
unless we start

06:03.998 --> 06:06.631
actually doing something
about our carbon footprint.

06:06.633 --> 06:09.269
Myra, if you don't wanna
leave a carbon footprint

06:09.271 --> 06:10.736
you're gonna have to stand
in one place

06:10.738 --> 06:12.004
for the rest of your life.

06:12.006 --> 06:13.005
Oh, and you're also gonna
need to stop

06:13.007 --> 06:15.874
eating, drinking and breathing.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.979
I will if you will.

06:32.094 --> 06:34.226
What,
is this your third request?

06:34.228 --> 06:36.061
- Fourth.
- Mm.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.196
I know you're my supervisor.

06:37.198 --> 06:39.898
I am trying to be respectful.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.900
I don't wanna go over your head,

06:41.902 --> 06:43.602
but, Stuart,
I will if I have to.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.871
Why do you wanna transfer
off this floor so badly?

06:45.873 --> 06:46.905
I want more literature.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.040
Well, then go hang out down in

06:48.042 --> 06:49.041
Arts and Lit on your lunchbreak.

06:49.043 --> 06:50.176
I wanna be around more

06:50.178 --> 06:51.712
of my literary heroes.

06:54.015 --> 06:55.814
This guy.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.784
"Wherever there's a fight
so hungry people can eat,

06:58.786 --> 07:00.319
I'll be there."

07:00.321 --> 07:04.289
My tenth grade crush.
Good old Johnny Steinbeck.

07:04.291 --> 07:08.927
You know, it's all drunks
and crazy people down in Lit.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.295
Which is so different
than up here?

07:10.297 --> 07:12.632
I'm talking about the authors.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.301
Incoming.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.669
Welcome
to the Downtown

07:17.671 --> 07:18.704
Cincinnati Public Library.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.805
Good morning, Dave.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.647
So explain to me again,

07:29.649 --> 07:32.085
how do you make cheesecake
without the cheese?

07:32.087 --> 07:34.920
I substitute the cheese
with condensed milk is how.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.057
Oh, I don't believe it.

07:37.059 --> 07:38.291
Ain't nobody never heard
of no cheesecake

07:38.293 --> 07:39.892
without the cheese, Smutts.

07:39.894 --> 07:42.962
Cheese was invented
by the Chinese 3000 years ago.

07:42.964 --> 07:44.264
Hail, Caesar.

07:44.266 --> 07:47.132
I don't have to prove anything
to any of you.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.868
I learned how to make it
when I was in the Navy.

07:48.870 --> 07:52.638
The United States Navy
sailed its first ships in 1492.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.042
Hail, Caesar.

07:55.177 --> 07:58.010
Hey, I heard two more people

07:58.012 --> 08:01.047
froze to death last night
in Northside.

08:01.049 --> 08:03.982
I don't know why they don't just
let us stay here

08:03.984 --> 08:05.151
when it gets this cold.

08:05.153 --> 08:06.986
- Yeah. You know, he's right.
- Yeah.

08:06.988 --> 08:09.389
We should just stay right here
when it gets this cold.

08:09.391 --> 08:11.858
They're not gonna turn
the library into a flophouse

08:11.860 --> 08:13.692
for alcoholics, Smutts.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.161
I haven't had a drink
in two weeks.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.965
- That's a lie.
- That's a miracle!

08:18.967 --> 08:20.233
That's a lie, Smutts.

08:20.235 --> 08:22.267
You and me, we had some beer
a few days ago.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.970
- See, see, I knew it.
- Oh, come on, man.

08:23.972 --> 08:26.439
I knew you was full of shit
with that no drinkin' shit.

08:26.441 --> 08:28.842
Just like y... your cheese-less
cheesecake too.

08:28.844 --> 08:30.043
Anybody got any aspirin?

08:30.045 --> 08:31.077
Aspirin was discovered

08:31.079 --> 08:32.412
by the French 600 years ago.

08:32.414 --> 08:34.914
It was originally made
from apple seeds.

08:34.916 --> 08:36.149
- Hail, Caesar.
- Hail, Caesar.

08:36.150 --> 08:38.817
Aspirin, Caesar,
is made from willow bark,

08:38.818 --> 08:40.019
not apple seeds.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.355
Then how come
it's always white, huh?

08:42.357 --> 08:44.022
Answer me that one, smart guy.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.359
'Cause it's mixed
with cornstarch.

08:46.361 --> 08:48.694
Hey.

08:48.696 --> 08:51.831
So it's cold enough for you,
Mr. Goodson?

08:51.833 --> 08:54.901
It's gonna be brutal
the next couple nights for sure.

08:54.903 --> 08:57.639
We can all come
stay at your place.

08:59.007 --> 09:02.442
- I would if I could.
- You could, but you won't.

09:02.444 --> 09:04.779
No judgement here though.

09:06.114 --> 09:07.848
Look, Jackson.

09:10.752 --> 09:14.320
Use it to get some food,
maybe a room.

09:14.322 --> 09:18.059
You're gonna offer me money and
then tell me what to do with it?

09:20.295 --> 09:23.963
W... well, no, I was just
suggesting a few things

09:23.965 --> 09:28.001
that I thought
you... you might need, is all.

09:28.003 --> 09:30.272
How do you know what I need?

09:46.455 --> 09:50.023
I'm just messing with you, man.

09:50.025 --> 09:51.492
He was just messing with you.

09:51.494 --> 09:54.227
- For the cause.
- Evil is the root of all money.

09:54.229 --> 09:56.363
Hail, Caesar!

09:56.365 --> 09:58.700
You guys are just
encouraging him.

10:01.102 --> 10:02.471
Whoa.

10:04.239 --> 10:07.474
- Who's he?
- That's George.

10:07.476 --> 10:10.043
- Where are you from, George?
- He's shy.

10:10.045 --> 10:12.778

Okay.

11:49.011 --> 11:50.910
Because I knew
you wouldn't come if I did.

11:50.912 --> 11:54.014
♪ Bright bright
bright bright... ♪

11:54.016 --> 11:56.417
Sir. Sir?

11:56.419 --> 11:59.522
♪ It's gonna be
a bright bright... ♪♪

12:02.625 --> 12:06.193
Hey, we got a medical
emergency on level three.

12:06.195 --> 12:08.928
I got a quote from a book
I turned in, like, last week.

12:08.930 --> 12:12.099
Uh, forgot the author,
and the title,

12:12.101 --> 12:14.967
but, uh, it's big, it's red,

12:14.969 --> 12:17.171
and I... I found it
on the top shelf.

12:17.173 --> 12:18.272
Can you find it for me?

12:18.274 --> 12:19.473
I need journal articles

12:19.475 --> 12:21.509
on parents
going back to college.

12:21.511 --> 12:23.610
Where are your books
on critical thinking?

12:23.612 --> 12:25.546
What kind of apple did Eve eat?

12:25.548 --> 12:28.315
I need the addresses
of the permanent missions

12:28.317 --> 12:30.951
of the United Nations
listed by countries.

12:30.953 --> 12:34.355
Can you tell me why so many
famous civil war battles

12:34.357 --> 12:36.592
were fought
on national park sites?

12:40.963 --> 12:44.432
I need a colored photograph
of George Washington.

12:44.434 --> 12:47.267
I'm looking for a list of laws
that I can break

12:47.269 --> 12:50.104
that would send me
back to jail...

12:50.106 --> 12:51.439
for a couple of months.

12:51.441 --> 12:52.973
- I am looking...
- I'm looking...

12:52.975 --> 12:54.508
- I'm looking...
- I'm looking...

12:54.510 --> 12:56.444
- I'm looking...
- I'm looking...

12:56.446 --> 12:58.480
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

13:15.265 --> 13:17.197
Remember
that children's story time

13:17.199 --> 13:20.470
will take place today
at 2:00 and at 4:00 p.m...

13:22.639 --> 13:26.174
Recommended for children
ages four through eight.

13:26.176 --> 13:28.342
Mr. Goodson.

13:28.344 --> 13:31.079
I didn't know this meeting would
be so formal, Mr. Anderson.

13:31.081 --> 13:34.381
Well, it's time-sensitive,
Mr. Goodson.

13:34.383 --> 13:38.086
The, uh, the library's
being sued.

13:38.088 --> 13:39.389
Have a seat.

13:43.093 --> 13:45.058
The attorneys for the plaintiff

13:45.060 --> 13:46.994
have presented the city
a settlement offer.

13:46.996 --> 13:49.731
However, we need to have
all the facts.

13:49.733 --> 13:53.167
I believe you've met
Mr. Foley and Mr. Larson before

13:53.169 --> 13:54.602
from our board of trustees

13:54.604 --> 13:58.338
who have been named
as defendants in this case.

13:58.340 --> 14:00.742
Their attorney, Mr. Abernathy.

14:00.744 --> 14:02.710
Of course,
you know Mr. Ramirez.

14:02.712 --> 14:06.080
He as well has been named
a defendant in this

14:06.082 --> 14:08.585
along with me and you.

14:11.487 --> 14:15.055
Hamilton County Prosecutor
Josh Davis.

14:15.057 --> 14:17.627
- I've seen you on television.
- Hmm.

14:26.436 --> 14:28.605
Do you recognize this man?

14:32.041 --> 14:35.610
- Yeah, that's Ike.
- Ike's name is Isiah Jennings.

14:35.612 --> 14:38.546
Mr. Jennings is suing
the Cincinnati Public Library

14:38.548 --> 14:40.280
for discrimination.

14:40.282 --> 14:44.219
In his petition, he claims
approximately ten weeks ago

14:44.221 --> 14:48.690
Mr. Goodson and Mr. Ramirez
asked him to leave the library

14:48.692 --> 14:52.127
because, and I quote,
"My body odor."

14:57.267 --> 14:59.567
Did you ask Mr. Jennings
to leave the library

14:59.569 --> 15:02.570
because of his body odor?

15:02.572 --> 15:05.573
We'd been getting complaints.
Daily complaints

15:05.575 --> 15:07.742
from library personnel
and patrons

15:07.744 --> 15:09.410
about the way Ike smelled.

15:09.412 --> 15:12.780
- So that's yes then?
- Yes.

15:12.782 --> 15:15.784
And then
you and Mr. Goodson

15:15.786 --> 15:19.320
escorted Mr. Jennings
outside of the building?

15:19.322 --> 15:20.488
That's right.

15:20.490 --> 15:21.690
And as you were
escorting him out

15:21.692 --> 15:24.425
do you recall
saying anything to him?

15:24.427 --> 15:27.530
I may have said something.
Small talk.

15:27.532 --> 15:29.765
So when you got him
out to the sidewalk

15:29.767 --> 15:32.600
in front of the library,
did you say,

15:32.602 --> 15:35.236
"Elvis has left the building?"

15:35.238 --> 15:36.304
Excuse me.

15:36.306 --> 15:37.438
- What is that?
- Excuse me.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.673
I'm asking Mr. Ramirez
right now.

15:38.675 --> 15:40.275
I just need to get some facts.

15:40.277 --> 15:42.176
Have you taken into account

15:42.178 --> 15:44.112
that in addition
to being homeless

15:44.114 --> 15:46.682
and on the street
for the last ten years

15:46.684 --> 15:48.316
that Ike is also mentally ill?

15:48.318 --> 15:49.851
Mr. Goodson,
I will get to you soon enough.

15:49.853 --> 15:51.287
He hears voices. One of them...

15:51.289 --> 15:53.588
Mr. Goodson,
Mr. Davis is simply trying

15:53.590 --> 15:55.757
to determine what action
the city needs to take,

15:55.759 --> 15:58.462
if it goes to trial or not,
okay?

15:59.797 --> 16:01.863
The settlement offer
from the attorneys

16:01.865 --> 16:05.768
representing Mr. Jennings
is $750,000.

16:05.770 --> 16:09.738
Now if the city
passes on this offer,

16:09.740 --> 16:11.372
it's gonna go to trial,

16:11.374 --> 16:14.209
and if the city of Cincinnati
is gonna write a check

16:14.211 --> 16:17.880
for $750,000
to a mentally ill homeless man,

16:17.882 --> 16:20.349
I need to be able to explain
to the mayor's office

16:20.351 --> 16:21.786
exactly what happened.

16:28.258 --> 16:30.093
What do you smell?

16:31.829 --> 16:34.230
On me, what do you smell?

16:35.632 --> 16:37.768
- Cologne.
- Is it offensive?

16:39.737 --> 16:43.140
It's on a little heavy,
but obviously that's your style.

16:45.610 --> 16:49.778
Would you ask me to leave the
library because of my cologne?

16:49.780 --> 16:52.781
If we received enough complaints

16:52.783 --> 16:55.784
from other patrons,
yes, maybe I would.

16:55.786 --> 17:00.388
And you'd be violating my First
Amendment rights, Mr. Goodson

17:00.390 --> 17:03.626
'cause at present, there is no
law about people wearing cologne

17:03.628 --> 17:04.792
nor is there a law determining

17:04.795 --> 17:06.260
how much cologne
a person can apply...

17:06.262 --> 17:08.430
Mr. Davis, libraries
all over the country

17:08.432 --> 17:10.866
struggle with the balance
between individual rights

17:10.867 --> 17:12.267
and the rights of other patrons

17:12.269 --> 17:13.801
to have a safe
and healthy environment.

17:13.804 --> 17:16.404
If Mr. Goodson asked me
to leave the premises

17:16.406 --> 17:18.607
because of my cologne,
is he not impinging

17:18.608 --> 17:21.477
on my First Amendment rights
to access the public library,

17:21.479 --> 17:23.411
to information
and its resources?

17:23.413 --> 17:24.780
Librarians take very seriously

17:24.781 --> 17:26.515
the right to freedom
of information.

17:26.517 --> 17:27.950
It's a core tenet
of what we do.

17:27.952 --> 17:29.550
Which is exactly what
Mr. Goodson

17:29.552 --> 17:31.286
denied Isiah Jennings

17:31.288 --> 17:33.389
when he asked him
to leave the library

17:33.391 --> 17:35.593
because of how he smelled.

17:55.013 --> 17:57.479
Please
be respectful of those patrons

17:57.481 --> 18:00.718
who are on the waiting list
to use the computers.

18:15.466 --> 18:16.866
Thank you so much, chief.

18:16.868 --> 18:18.534
I'm glad to know
we're on the same page.

18:18.536 --> 18:20.369
- Of course.
- Appreciate it, chief.

18:20.371 --> 18:22.739
Okay. Bill, come on in.

18:22.741 --> 18:24.208
Excuse me.

18:27.645 --> 18:30.479
Josh Davis looking
for an endorsement?

18:30.481 --> 18:32.047
You can't get elected
mayor of Cincy

18:32.049 --> 18:34.351
without the support
of this department.

18:37.288 --> 18:38.487
He's an asshole.

18:39.658 --> 18:41.925
I'm endorsing Bradley.
Davis knows it.

18:41.927 --> 18:44.560
- He thinks it's a black thing.
- Oh.

18:44.562 --> 18:47.296
- Is it?
- It's a character thing.

18:47.298 --> 18:49.765
But, yes,
I would like to see more color

18:49.767 --> 18:51.768
in the local government.

18:51.770 --> 18:54.503
But you ain't come here
to talk politics.

18:54.505 --> 18:55.671
No.

18:55.673 --> 18:56.705
It's about your request

18:56.707 --> 18:58.041
for a leave of absence.

18:58.043 --> 18:59.678
That's right.

19:01.412 --> 19:03.646
I don't need to tell you
this is the busiest time of year

19:03.648 --> 19:06.317
for my best crisis negotiator
to be off the clock.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.956
My son is missing.

19:12.356 --> 19:15.325
Bill, we both know
your son's not missing.

19:15.327 --> 19:17.526
He's strung out somewhere
doing God knows what.

19:17.528 --> 19:20.530
Yes, he is an addict,
and I'm trying to keep him

19:20.532 --> 19:22.732
from becoming another casualty
on the streets, Tom.

19:22.734 --> 19:24.433
There's only so much
you can do, brother.

19:24.435 --> 19:27.672
You don't think I know that?
For God's sakes, Tom! Come on.

19:31.442 --> 19:34.778
Bill... I'm sorry.

19:34.780 --> 19:37.048
I can't let you go right now.
Not right now.

19:38.383 --> 19:39.816
You're a father, Tom.

19:39.818 --> 19:41.918
I'm also the chief of police
for a city

19:41.920 --> 19:45.390
with one of the biggest
opioid epidemics in the country.

19:46.825 --> 19:49.928
Look, I am sorry about your son.
I truly am.

19:51.096 --> 19:54.830
I mean, do you have any leads
or anything?

19:54.832 --> 19:56.666
He used his debit card
last Sunday,

19:56.668 --> 19:58.868
so he's still in town.
We just don't know where.

19:58.870 --> 20:00.702
- A debit card?
- His mom.

20:00.704 --> 20:02.739
You know, she hopes he'll use it

20:02.741 --> 20:04.507
for food or warm clothes or...

20:04.509 --> 20:06.044
I get it.

20:09.114 --> 20:10.782
Tom...

20:12.483 --> 20:13.852
please.

20:17.122 --> 20:18.991
Tom, please.

20:21.827 --> 20:24.494
I'm gonna get you
some time off, pal.

20:24.496 --> 20:26.498
That's my promise to you.

20:37.576 --> 20:38.775
Good evening.

20:38.777 --> 20:40.543
May I have your attention,
please?

20:40.545 --> 20:42.612
In ten minutes, the main library

20:42.614 --> 20:44.148
will be closing for the night.

20:44.150 --> 20:46.916
If you're working on a computer,
please be sure

20:46.918 --> 20:49.019
to save your work
before shutting it down

20:49.021 --> 20:52.421
and pick up any items
you may have at the printer.

20:52.423 --> 20:54.557
Also, be sure
to take any materials

20:54.559 --> 20:57.026
you wish to borrow
to the checkout station.

20:57.028 --> 21:01.466
Once again, the main library
will be closing in ten minutes.

21:04.502 --> 21:07.737
Library is closed,
people!

21:07.739 --> 21:09.606
Wrap it up and let's go!

21:09.608 --> 21:13.509
Library is closed.
Athena, time to go.

21:13.511 --> 21:16.647
I'll leave
when I'm damn good and ready.

21:16.649 --> 21:19.682
Our End Hunger
in Cincy donation drive

21:19.684 --> 21:20.717
will continue through...

21:20.719 --> 21:22.820
- I'm ready now.
- Okay.

21:22.822 --> 21:25.688
Accepting all
canned and bottled food items.

21:25.690 --> 21:28.459
Remember, every donation counts.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.727
We open at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow,
okay?

21:33.198 --> 21:36.934
- You need a ride home?
- I'm halfway across the city.

21:36.936 --> 21:38.102
And the bus
is actually much warmer

21:38.104 --> 21:40.473
than your shitty old car, so...

21:41.841 --> 21:44.941
- How you holding up?
- I'm peachy.

21:44.943 --> 21:47.244
Well, please don't let it
get to you.

21:47.246 --> 21:49.545
You know, literally,
our biggest struggle here

21:49.547 --> 21:53.217
is knowing which side of right
we're actually walking on, so...

21:53.219 --> 21:56.086
I mean, I wish all these
problems could just be solved

21:56.088 --> 21:59.223
by a community bake sale, but...

21:59.225 --> 22:00.825
they can't.

22:09.635 --> 22:12.036
I do go home sometimes and...

22:12.038 --> 22:15.141
just cry myself to sleep
because...

22:17.009 --> 22:19.178
I mean, we're only human, right?

22:25.984 --> 22:27.818
But not tonight.

22:27.820 --> 22:31.990
Because tonight is
make-dinner-for-my-mama night.

22:33.192 --> 22:36.095
So your transfer
to Arts and Lit...

22:36.996 --> 22:38.231
next week.

22:39.632 --> 22:41.198
My hero.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.598
A training course...

22:42.600 --> 22:44.601
Sleep well, comrade.

22:44.603 --> 22:46.737
Will be
taking place this Saturday

22:46.739 --> 22:48.771
in the quad after closing hours.

22:48.773 --> 22:51.010
Attendance is voluntary.

23:09.128 --> 23:11.762
So you did get my messages.

23:11.764 --> 23:14.065
- About the heat?
- About the absence of it.

23:14.067 --> 23:16.633
- It's an old building, Stuart.
- Yeah. I know.

23:16.635 --> 23:18.970
Built 1865.
Did you know that?

23:18.972 --> 23:20.738
- It's part of the charm.
- Oh, yeah?

23:20.740 --> 23:22.172
How charming
wearing my entire wardrobe

23:22.174 --> 23:23.807
to bed
for the last three nights.

23:23.809 --> 23:25.243
You were aware
that this building had issues

23:25.245 --> 23:27.077
with its heat
when you signed the lease.

23:27.079 --> 23:28.912
It's, like, a 0 degrees in here.

23:28.914 --> 23:32.052
As you can see,
I'm working on it.

23:34.253 --> 23:36.622
Did you work up an appetite?

23:42.329 --> 23:44.028
I brought you these heaters
from upstairs.

23:44.030 --> 23:47.798
I thought you could use them
until the heat comes back on.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.268
Thank you.

23:50.270 --> 23:52.770
I'm gonna have to call
a real repairman tomorrow.

23:52.772 --> 23:55.206
Real being the operative word.

23:55.208 --> 23:57.674
I took the job...

23:57.676 --> 24:00.147
because it offered a break
on the rent.

24:02.215 --> 24:04.114
But I'm not gonna lie,
there's an awful lot

24:04.116 --> 24:05.884
that needs fixing
about this place.

24:05.886 --> 24:07.218
Like, a whole lot.

24:07.220 --> 24:08.952
Our landlord doesn't really
expect you to do

24:08.954 --> 24:11.656
all the maintenance around here,
does he?

24:11.658 --> 24:14.359
I refused to have dinner
with him last month

24:14.361 --> 24:17.095
and then the month before that,

24:17.097 --> 24:20.365
so he seems to think
he's really screwing me

24:20.367 --> 24:22.735
even though he's not
really screwing me.

24:29.943 --> 24:31.376
What are you doing?

24:31.378 --> 24:33.710
A medium pizza

24:33.712 --> 24:38.183
with fresh tomatoes and basil
costs $12.50.

24:38.185 --> 24:41.352
But a plain cheese
costs just under ten bucks.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.722
So since I grow my own...

24:47.260 --> 24:48.627
Wow.

24:53.934 --> 24:57.302
You keep your apartment
really neat and clean.

24:57.304 --> 25:00.038
- You'd hate to see my place.
- That's my thing.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.939
- I'm a little OCD.
- Ah.

25:01.941 --> 25:04.175
Chaos in the environment,
chaos in your head.

25:04.177 --> 25:05.977
Oh, well, there's always chaos
in my head.

25:05.979 --> 25:08.614
It doesn't matter whether
I take the trash out or not.

25:10.117 --> 25:13.284
What made you decide
to become a librarian?

25:13.286 --> 25:15.287
You know,
I've been asking myself

25:15.289 --> 25:16.721
that question a lot lately.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.957
It must be really nice
to have a job

25:18.959 --> 25:22.295
where you get to sit around
and read all day, huh?

25:24.898 --> 25:26.297
Oh, yeah.

25:26.299 --> 25:29.934
I mean, do people even go
to libraries anymore?

25:29.936 --> 25:32.971
Yes. You should come visit.

25:32.973 --> 25:35.306
Get yourself a library card.
Impress your friends.

25:35.308 --> 25:37.308
I might just do that.
Come and watch you do

25:37.310 --> 25:39.411
all your freaky
librarian things.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.279
You know,
watch you get all crazy

25:41.281 --> 25:43.649
with your Dewey Decimal System.

25:45.785 --> 25:47.354
"Learning The Qur'an."

25:49.788 --> 25:51.357
Hm.

25:51.359 --> 25:54.725
You getting into it? Are you
thinking about converting?

25:54.727 --> 25:56.861
Some books get defaced
and, you know,

25:56.863 --> 25:59.497
if I can fix them,
make a little extra money, I do.

25:59.499 --> 26:01.299
Oh, wow.

26:01.301 --> 26:04.137
Hate crimes.
Seeing a lot of that lately.

26:05.505 --> 26:08.075
So you're just
really into books, huh?

26:09.876 --> 26:12.210
Books saved my life.

26:12.212 --> 26:14.346
Saved your life?

26:14.348 --> 26:16.814
Books helped me get sober

26:16.816 --> 26:21.085
and... helped me
turn my life around.

26:21.087 --> 26:23.388
They were tangible
and they were real.

26:23.390 --> 26:27.959
Something I could get my hands
and my head around, so yeah.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.096
Yeah, they saved my life.

26:37.205 --> 26:40.407
"It works if you work it."
One year.

26:43.877 --> 26:47.214
One year and still trudging
the road of happy destiny.

26:50.384 --> 26:52.217
I piled up
a bunch of other addictions

26:52.219 --> 26:53.985
while I was at it.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.456
Drugs...

26:56.524 --> 26:58.356
sex.

26:58.358 --> 27:00.526
Tell me about it.
I'm still working on that one.

27:00.528 --> 27:02.827
Stuart.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.229
Come on.

27:04.231 --> 27:06.498
It's not like I see
a parade of women

27:06.500 --> 27:08.334
coming in and out
of your apartment.

27:08.336 --> 27:10.301
Are you clockin' me?

27:10.303 --> 27:12.271
I'm the building manager.

27:12.273 --> 27:15.507
I... see a lot of stuff.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.376
I get to know
the habits of the tenants.

27:17.378 --> 27:19.877
- Okay.
- Yeah.

27:19.879 --> 27:22.046
The guy, over in 6,

27:22.048 --> 27:24.550
I'll bet he's got a freezer
full of body parts.

27:24.552 --> 27:27.353
No.

27:27.355 --> 27:30.256
No, he's an accountant.
Never late on his rent.

27:30.258 --> 27:35.060
Okay.
Um, t... the couple over in 4?

27:35.062 --> 27:37.962
Oh. They're professors at UC.

27:37.964 --> 27:40.231
Also, swingers.

27:40.233 --> 27:42.034
- No way.
- Mm-hmm.

27:42.036 --> 27:45.437
- Did they...
- Invite me to join them? Yes.

27:45.439 --> 27:48.440
I didn't, of course.

27:48.442 --> 27:50.311
The guy up in 10?

28:00.154 --> 28:02.856
Still gathering
some intel on him.

28:04.325 --> 28:07.059
He's a little weird.

28:07.061 --> 28:08.462
Not creepy...

28:10.197 --> 28:11.532
but weird.

28:13.334 --> 28:17.004
So far, I know
he's really into books...

28:18.306 --> 28:21.039
and he's a librarian,

28:21.041 --> 28:22.511
so that makes sense.

28:23.911 --> 28:26.480
He's, uh, sober.

28:28.149 --> 28:30.351
He grows his own tomatoes.

28:31.652 --> 28:34.489
And he doesn't really
have a lot of visitors.

28:38.326 --> 28:40.462
I think you should stay away
from him.

28:58.346 --> 28:59.978
Ramstead?

28:59.980 --> 29:02.549
No. Nobody in here
with that name, man.

29:02.551 --> 29:05.417
Well, maybe he's under an alias.
He doesn't wanna be found.

29:05.419 --> 29:07.319
Most of the men in here don't,
detective,

29:07.321 --> 29:11.256
but you can go ahead and have
yourself a peek just the same.

29:56.705 --> 29:59.706
So we'll try again tomorrow.

29:59.708 --> 30:01.042
Sure.

30:03.043 --> 30:05.577
You don't have to walk me
to the door.

30:05.579 --> 30:08.116
I wasn't going to.
It's 10 degrees outside.

30:13.588 --> 30:16.054
I know you're still upset
about the debit card...

30:16.056 --> 30:17.591
No, I'm not.

30:18.627 --> 30:20.662
He's your son, too, Marcy.

30:22.196 --> 30:24.030
And if he's not too loaded,
let's just hope

30:24.032 --> 30:26.435
he had the sense to use it
to get a room tonight.

30:57.231 --> 31:00.300
- Good morning.
- Hi.

31:00.302 --> 31:02.635
You know, I think I'd like
to come down to the library

31:02.637 --> 31:06.639
and see some of those books
that saved your life.

31:06.641 --> 31:08.641
Alright, if you feel like
braving the cold.

31:08.643 --> 31:12.378
Yeah. We close at 6 o'clock,
so come on down.

31:12.380 --> 31:16.717
Maybe we can, I don't know,
grab a bite to eat over at OTR?

31:16.719 --> 31:19.352
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Good.

31:19.354 --> 31:20.655
Okay.

31:21.790 --> 31:23.191
Hey.

31:25.327 --> 31:30.465
You know, I was a lot of things
before I was a drunk.

31:31.399 --> 31:33.667
I wasn't always...

31:33.669 --> 31:36.204
fixing broken heaters
for cheap rent.

31:39.509 --> 31:41.407
I hope
this isn't gonna get weird,

31:41.409 --> 31:44.179
because I don't really think
I can handle this getting weird.

31:45.815 --> 31:48.681
You seem like
a really good guy

31:48.683 --> 31:51.687
and I hope I'm not wrong.

31:59.594 --> 32:01.160
<i>And with
this blast</i>

32:01.162 --> 32:03.397
<i>of Arctic air
and frigid temperatures,</i>

32:03.399 --> 32:05.465
<i>local homeless shelters
are hitting capacity...</i>

32:05.467 --> 32:07.700
<i>The bitter cold
Arctic air is settling in</i>

32:07.702 --> 32:10.436
<i>and we've got a very cold night
coming up tonight.</i>

32:10.438 --> 32:13.206
<i>Probably the coldest night
of the year. The lowest...</i>

32:13.208 --> 32:15.309
These guys bought this lion cub,

32:15.311 --> 32:18.278
right, at Harrods,
release it into the wild.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.445
Twenty years later, they go back

32:19.447 --> 32:21.682
and the freakin' lion
remembers them.

32:21.684 --> 32:24.250
- Barnes.
- He's okay.

32:24.252 --> 32:25.787
Alright. You're good.

32:28.791 --> 32:31.259
- Drugs?
- Exposure.

32:34.597 --> 32:37.466
- You know him?
- Yeah, he's a regular patron.

32:38.668 --> 32:40.701
We're gonna go live
in moments, Rebecca.

32:40.703 --> 32:43.304
Alright. Let's go.

32:43.306 --> 32:46.272
Let's get this over with before
I freakin' freeze to death.

32:46.274 --> 32:47.340
- Ernesto.
- Yeah?

32:47.342 --> 32:48.675
- Did you find him?
- Yeah.

32:48.677 --> 32:51.512
I tried to revive him,
but he was unresponsive.

32:51.514 --> 32:52.780
This weather's no joke, brother.

32:52.782 --> 32:54.280
City in recent days.

32:54.282 --> 32:56.584
The severe cold spell
has already claimed

32:56.586 --> 32:58.719
nearly half a dozen lives
this week.

32:58.721 --> 33:01.255
The unidentified homeless man
was found dead

33:01.257 --> 33:02.623
just outside the doors

33:02.625 --> 33:05.191
of the Downtown Cincinnati
Public Library.

33:05.193 --> 33:06.895
Witnesses called police
early this morning

33:06.897 --> 33:10.430
to report a body outside
the library near Walnut Street.

33:10.432 --> 33:13.502
Police are not treating the
scene as a homicide. However...

33:16.204 --> 33:20.874
<i>Indian Hill,
where Josh Davis grew up</i>

33:20.876 --> 33:23.343
<i>with a silver spoon
in his mouth.</i>

33:23.345 --> 33:26.515
<i>Even if he's now trying
to deny it.</i>

33:29.785 --> 33:31.619
I'm Earl Bradley.

33:31.621 --> 33:33.954
I grew up here,
on these streets,

33:33.956 --> 33:34.955
in this community.

33:34.957 --> 33:37.925
<i>I'm a pastor
and small businessman.</i>

33:37.927 --> 33:40.426
<i>It's why I'll stand up
to special interest</i>

33:40.428 --> 33:43.530
<i>and fight for you every day</i>

33:43.532 --> 33:46.902
because we need a mayor
for all of us.

33:48.804 --> 33:50.804
This thing went up
on their website last week.

33:50.806 --> 33:52.606
It's already gone viral.

33:52.608 --> 33:55.342
Hm. Freakin' baby carriage?

33:55.344 --> 33:57.811
It's effective, and it's, uh,

33:57.813 --> 34:01.448
it's driving grassroots
low-dollar fundraising, Josh.

34:01.450 --> 34:03.951
Also means Bradley gets
on TV earlier than we do.

34:03.953 --> 34:05.285
Maybe you should go
work for him.

34:05.287 --> 34:06.453
Maybe I will.

34:06.455 --> 34:07.688
Let's have a look at our spot.

34:07.690 --> 34:10.257
If it sucks,
then maybe you'll need to.

34:14.864 --> 34:17.364
<i>What happened
to Cincinnati?</i>

34:17.366 --> 34:19.233
<i>To our neighborhoods?</i>

34:19.235 --> 34:22.536
<i>Who let criminals
take control of our city?</i>

34:22.539 --> 34:23.972
<i>Politicians in Columbus</i>

34:23.974 --> 34:26.440
<i>who don't have a clue,
that's who.</i>

34:26.442 --> 34:27.641
Voice sounds good.

34:27.643 --> 34:28.710
Well, enough's enough.

34:28.712 --> 34:30.244
I'm Josh Davis.

34:30.246 --> 34:32.746
As prosecutor,
I cracked down on crime.

34:32.748 --> 34:34.348
<i>Tough but fair.</i>

34:34.350 --> 34:37.451
<i>As mayor, I will take on
politics as usual</i>

34:37.453 --> 34:38.851
<i>and restore law and order</i>

34:38.853 --> 34:41.321
<i>so we can help grow
small business,</i>

34:41.322 --> 34:45.327
<i>protect our way of life
to move Cincinnati forward.</i>

34:47.664 --> 34:49.396
It doesn't suck.

34:51.735 --> 34:53.634
It doesn't suck.

34:53.636 --> 34:55.803
This goes up
on our website Monday, Josh.

34:55.804 --> 34:58.240
Tell me,
what don't you like about it?

34:59.743 --> 35:02.609
I just wish I looked nicer.

35:02.611 --> 35:04.879
- Nicer?
- Yeah, you know, not so angry.

35:04.881 --> 35:08.415
I mean, I'm not an angry guy.
Just, I'm passionate, you know.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.885
I wanna, I wanna look nicer
in the ad.

35:10.887 --> 35:12.020
Yeah, yeah.
Pl... plenty of takes.

35:12.022 --> 35:13.887
We'll... we'll go
through them all

35:13.889 --> 35:15.890
with that in mind,
find you a nicer take.

35:15.892 --> 35:18.227
You got it, Josh. Nicer take.

35:20.764 --> 35:21.996
Can I beat him?

35:21.998 --> 35:24.032
Bradley's a pillar
of the community, Josh.

35:24.034 --> 35:26.968
- He's a pastor, he's a...
- Can I beat him?

35:26.970 --> 35:28.370
No.

35:29.538 --> 35:30.804
Early polling suggests

35:30.806 --> 35:33.341
that if the election
were held tomorrow,

35:33.343 --> 35:34.911
he wins in a walk.

35:37.513 --> 35:38.882
Unless...

35:41.785 --> 35:44.319
unless something were to happen,
something big

35:44.321 --> 35:48.357
that puts you and the community
in the spotlight, alright?

35:50.794 --> 35:53.494
Something besides...

35:53.496 --> 35:56.466
another embarrassing
unarmed police shooting.

36:07.410 --> 36:08.877
- Hi.
- Yes.

36:08.879 --> 36:11.380
I'm looking for a globe
of the Earth.

36:13.617 --> 36:15.650
They're all right there.

36:15.652 --> 36:19.023
No, that's not good enough.
Isn't there a life-sized one?

36:20.824 --> 36:24.393
Yes, but it's currently in use.

36:26.530 --> 36:29.530
Hey, uh, there are a bunch of
guys fighting in the men's room.

36:29.532 --> 36:31.100
You were supposed
to look out for him, Ray.

36:31.102 --> 36:32.700
Lay off him, man,
you were more concerned

36:32.702 --> 36:34.836
about finding a bottle
than you were about any of us.

36:34.838 --> 36:36.972
Oh, that's bullshit, Smutts!

36:36.974 --> 36:40.542
You would be dead ten times if
I wasn't there to save your ass!

36:40.544 --> 36:42.947
- You know it!
- What's going on, fellas?

36:45.749 --> 36:47.783
Caesar's missing.

36:47.785 --> 36:49.450
No one has seen him
since last night.

36:49.452 --> 36:52.520
We were riding on the metro
to keep warm.

36:52.522 --> 36:55.723
Somewhere along the way,
he must have wandered off.

36:55.725 --> 36:58.760
We looked around
and he was just gone!

36:58.762 --> 37:00.029
Just like that.

37:00.031 --> 37:01.729
One minute he's there,

37:01.731 --> 37:03.131
the next minute he's not.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.133
We looked all around.
No one has seen him.

37:05.135 --> 37:06.734
I mean, nobody!

37:06.736 --> 37:09.871
Cold must have got him,
Mr. Goodson.

37:09.873 --> 37:11.740
I got a bad feeling, man.

37:11.742 --> 37:14.878
It ain't like Caesar to not be
here when the public opens.

37:16.881 --> 37:19.883
- Caesar's dead.
- What?

37:23.154 --> 37:25.488
How do you know that, George?

37:27.591 --> 37:30.027
- Because I killed him.
- What?

37:33.763 --> 37:36.866
You killed Caesar?

37:36.868 --> 37:40.135
- That's right.
- Why would you kill Caesar?

37:40.137 --> 37:42.637
What did he ever do to you?

37:42.639 --> 37:44.875
He never did anything to me.

37:46.010 --> 37:48.978
I didn't even know him
that good.

37:48.980 --> 37:53.017
So... what do you mean
you killed him?

37:54.818 --> 37:57.686
I killed him with my laser eyes.

37:57.688 --> 38:00.122
See, the government,

38:00.124 --> 38:02.891
they... they... they put
this weapon in my head

38:02.893 --> 38:04.793
when I was a baby.

38:04.795 --> 38:06.728
It's a laser.

38:06.730 --> 38:09.999
It, it kills people
when I look at 'em for too long.

38:10.001 --> 38:12.234
It's, it's a chip.

38:12.236 --> 38:15.070
They put 'em in a lot of babies
when they're born.

38:15.072 --> 38:17.973
And... and that's why I...

38:17.975 --> 38:20.575
I don't wanna look
at any of you for so long.

38:20.577 --> 38:22.578
I...

38:22.580 --> 38:24.547
I don't wanna kill anyone else.

38:27.752 --> 38:29.952
You looked at Caesar too long?

38:29.954 --> 38:32.156
That's what happened,
Big George?

38:34.558 --> 38:36.526
I looked at him...

38:38.028 --> 38:42.934
for a real long time
with my laser eyes.

38:45.236 --> 38:47.703
He exploded.

38:47.705 --> 38:49.171
Caesar exploded?

38:49.173 --> 38:53.108
You mean like in that movie,
"Scanners?"

38:53.110 --> 38:56.146
- I love that movie, man.
- Oh, man.

38:56.148 --> 38:59.181
You know. You... you remember?

39:05.790 --> 39:08.258
Boom.

39:08.260 --> 39:09.825
- You saw that movie, right?
- Oh!

39:09.827 --> 39:12.127
- Oh, come on, Stuart!
- That was a good movie.

39:12.129 --> 39:15.731
- You gotta know! You know!
- You guys are crazy, man.

39:15.733 --> 39:18.766
- It's like...
- Oh.

39:18.768 --> 39:20.536
Boom.

39:20.538 --> 39:21.971
Yeah.

39:21.973 --> 39:25.075
Stupid. You're so...

39:25.077 --> 39:27.910
Oh, I love it.
I love it though.

39:30.014 --> 39:31.147
Good evening.

39:31.149 --> 39:32.881
May I have your attention,
please?

39:32.883 --> 39:34.249
In ten minutes, the main library

39:34.251 --> 39:35.884
will be closing for the night.

39:35.886 --> 39:37.287
If you are working
on a computer,

39:37.289 --> 39:40.222
please be sure to save your work
before shutting it down.

39:40.224 --> 39:44.262
Once again, the main library
will be closing in ten minutes.

39:52.269 --> 39:55.238
Mr. Goodson,
I gotta talk to you.

39:55.240 --> 39:59.308
Look, all, all the shelters
downtown are full up again.

39:59.310 --> 40:02.278
Uh-huh. What about the emergency
overflow at Shelterhouse?

40:02.280 --> 40:05.247
That's a 40-minute walk
away.

40:05.249 --> 40:08.220
In this weather?
In these shoes?

40:09.787 --> 40:13.189
Look, Mr. Goodson,
you know I'm a veteran, right?

40:13.191 --> 40:17.161
I served my country.
This all I get?

40:19.131 --> 40:22.631
Well, look.
I... I... I decided to organize.

40:22.633 --> 40:24.067
Organize?

40:24.069 --> 40:26.702
We ain't gonna leave
the library tonight.

40:26.704 --> 40:28.938
Tonight we occupy.

40:28.940 --> 40:31.341
- Occupy? Is that right?
- Yeah.

40:31.343 --> 40:33.742
Well, so what about
tomorrow night?

40:33.744 --> 40:35.078
And the night after that?

40:35.080 --> 40:37.613
What if this cold snap
lasts into next week?

40:37.615 --> 40:40.952
- Have you thought about that?
- Mr. Goodson, listen to me!

40:43.321 --> 40:45.854
Every public official
in this town know

40:45.856 --> 40:49.259
there's not enough shelter
for us people on the street.

40:49.261 --> 40:51.994
Those so-called Christians,
they, they pretend

40:51.996 --> 40:53.730
like they don't know that.

40:53.732 --> 40:55.731
Feed the hungry.

40:55.733 --> 40:58.068
Clothe the poor.

40:58.070 --> 41:00.836
House the homeless.

41:00.838 --> 41:04.007
Now see, that's what Jesus said.

41:04.009 --> 41:06.278
But I don't think
he said occupy.

41:07.845 --> 41:10.649
Well, it worked for those
hippies down in Wall Street.

41:12.117 --> 41:14.585
Maybe it can work here for us.

coming up to see you.

41:52.090 --> 41:54.424
Do you have a moment?

41:54.426 --> 41:56.327
Is this about the settlement?

41:56.329 --> 41:59.030
It has nothing to do with that.
I... it's about the weather.

42:00.764 --> 42:02.767
I'll catch up with you.

42:06.171 --> 42:08.072
- The weather?
- Yes.

42:08.074 --> 42:10.406
We need to keep the library
open tonight because of it.

42:10.408 --> 42:12.208
Our patrons
who don't get into shelters,

42:12.210 --> 42:13.710
they are at risk of exposure.

42:13.712 --> 42:15.211
T... the temperature's
gonna drop below 0.

42:15.213 --> 42:16.946
Mr. Goodson,
I'm well aware of the problem,

42:16.948 --> 42:18.414
but we're a public library.

42:18.416 --> 42:19.983
We're not a shelter
for the homeless.

42:19.985 --> 42:22.819
No, that's exactly what we are.
Every day of every week.

42:22.821 --> 42:25.356
I'm not in the position
to declare our library

42:25.358 --> 42:27.090
an emergency shelter.

42:27.092 --> 42:28.758
People are freezing to death
in our own city.

42:28.760 --> 42:31.761
- How are you okay with that?
- Whoa, hey! I'm not.

42:31.763 --> 42:32.862
I'm not okay with it.

42:32.864 --> 42:34.498
Okay, you could, you could call
the mayor's office.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.099
You could call
the mayor's office right now!

42:36.101 --> 42:38.801
- Mr. Goodson...
- But...

42:38.803 --> 42:40.438
Stuart, listen.

42:42.374 --> 42:45.177
The board of trustees
wants you gone.

42:46.344 --> 42:48.411
That's what's going on.

42:48.413 --> 42:52.081
And I'm trying,
but I'm having a difficult time

42:52.083 --> 42:54.817
makin' a case for you
to stay here.

42:54.819 --> 42:59.355
So, no. The library will not be
an emergency shelter tonight,

42:59.357 --> 43:02.195
tomorrow, not ever.

43:03.795 --> 43:05.495
They wanna fire me?

43:05.497 --> 43:07.799
They'd prefer if you tendered
your resignation.

43:08.867 --> 43:11.201
I was following
library protocol, sir.

43:11.203 --> 43:13.537
Fire me for doing my job?

43:13.539 --> 43:15.038
I'm sorry.

43:15.040 --> 43:18.144
- It's out of my control.
- Out of your control?

43:19.978 --> 43:21.512
You have no idea how much shit

43:21.514 --> 43:23.279

- I don't know.
- I don't know anything.

43:36.529 --> 43:39.095
Can anyone confirm or deny if
we have a special event tonight?

43:39.097 --> 43:41.865
I'm seein' a bunch of patrons
up on the third floor.

43:43.302 --> 43:44.435
Good evening.

43:44.437 --> 43:46.369
May I have your attention,
please?

43:46.371 --> 43:49.139
The main library is now closed.

43:49.141 --> 43:51.874
Pleas exit the building.
Once again...

43:51.876 --> 43:54.311
Stuart, what's going on?
Nobody's leaving.

43:54.313 --> 43:55.945
Patrons are staging an action.

43:55.947 --> 43:58.450
- What are they protesting?
- Freezing to death.

43:58.452 --> 44:02.419
Stuart.
What the hell's going on, man?

44:02.421 --> 44:03.953
What are all these people
still doing here?

44:03.955 --> 44:05.222
Remember how difficult
it was

44:05.224 --> 44:06.590
to get Ike out of the library?

44:06.592 --> 44:08.425
Yeah, we should have left
his stinky-ass alone.

44:08.427 --> 44:09.959
We wouldn't be
in all this trouble.

44:09.961 --> 44:11.929
Well, now we got
a whole lot of Ikes in here

44:11.931 --> 44:13.330
who don't wanna go out
in the cold.

44:13.332 --> 44:14.897
I don't blame 'em, man.
I wouldn't either.

44:14.899 --> 44:17.901
What's it gonna be,
Mr. Goodson?

44:17.903 --> 44:20.805
You're either one of us
or you're one of them, right?

44:24.343 --> 44:28.412
Everybody, uh, rally up!
Rally up!

44:28.414 --> 44:30.180
Ernesto,
what's going on up on three?

44:30.182 --> 44:31.615
Uh, everybody, listen up!

44:31.617 --> 44:34.586
The library
has not been sanctioned

44:34.588 --> 44:37.887
an official emergency shelter
yet.

44:37.889 --> 44:40.391
- But we believe it should be!
- Ernesto, you on this?

44:40.393 --> 44:43.294
Yeah, give me a sec.

44:43.296 --> 44:45.532
What the hell do I tell him?

44:47.933 --> 44:49.966
Dude.

44:53.039 --> 44:55.938
Uh, you ever been arrested?

44:55.940 --> 44:59.610
- Uh, no, have you?
- Unfortunately.

44:59.612 --> 45:02.482
- Pepper sprayed?
- No. You have?

45:04.250 --> 45:06.319
Are we staying or we goin'?

45:08.322 --> 45:09.621
Get out of here, Myra.

45:09.623 --> 45:11.488
If you're staying,
I'm gonna stay.

45:17.330 --> 45:19.063
Incoming!

45:44.358 --> 45:48.192
- George.
- Don't look at me.

45:48.194 --> 45:50.395
I'm... I'm not...
I'm not lookin' at you.

45:50.397 --> 45:52.396
But I need you to move
that bookshelf

45:52.398 --> 45:54.598
up against the doors.

45:54.600 --> 45:55.700
Why?

45:57.471 --> 45:59.403
Be... because security is coming

45:59.405 --> 46:01.541
and... and... and we don't
want 'em in here.

46:02.975 --> 46:04.343
Why?

46:06.278 --> 46:08.382
Because they have
laser eyes too.

46:09.549 --> 46:11.315
From... from the government?

46:11.317 --> 46:13.151
Wh... when they were babies?

46:13.153 --> 46:16.322
Yes, and we don't want them
in here hurting people.

46:43.116 --> 46:45.419
Jackson, give us a hand!

46:53.593 --> 46:55.593
What is it they want,
Mr. Anderson?

46:55.595 --> 46:59.197
- They wanna stay warm.
- Warm?

47:06.606 --> 47:08.173
Why can't we handle
this in-house

47:08.175 --> 47:10.140
with our own security detail?

47:10.142 --> 47:13.378
It's standard operating
procedure to alert the Cincy PD

47:13.380 --> 47:15.615
if we're
in a lockdown situation, sir.

47:41.441 --> 47:43.543
So, what's the plan?

47:44.511 --> 47:47.178
Uh, plan?

47:47.180 --> 47:50.114
Uh, uh, that was it.

47:50.116 --> 47:52.587
You know, um, they're out,
we're in.

47:54.654 --> 47:56.656
I know they're watchin'.

47:58.091 --> 47:59.692
Oh, yeah. They're...
they're lookin' at us

47:59.694 --> 48:03.196
like a... another bunch
of crazy angry niggas.

48:04.832 --> 48:07.400
It's up to you
to prove 'em wrong, Mr. Goodson.

48:09.270 --> 48:10.569
Why me?

48:10.571 --> 48:13.638
'Cause they don't think
you crazy.

48:13.640 --> 48:17.141
Come on, man!

48:17.143 --> 48:19.112
Why him?

48:26.587 --> 48:28.554
This isn't an action.

48:28.556 --> 48:31.725
This is... a disaster.

48:43.470 --> 48:45.038
Yeah?

48:46.474 --> 48:49.441
Wh... what about Peters?

48:49.443 --> 48:51.579
Can't you track down Lou?

48:52.780 --> 48:54.479
Okay.

48:54.481 --> 48:56.582
Yeah, okay.

48:56.584 --> 48:58.884
Five minutes.

48:58.886 --> 49:00.554
What is it?

49:02.590 --> 49:05.290
There's some situation
at the central library.

49:05.292 --> 49:08.327
Probably somebody having a
meltdown about an overdue book.

49:08.329 --> 49:10.161
Mm.

49:10.163 --> 49:11.764
You wanna go with?

49:11.766 --> 49:13.732
I mean, it could be
just a bunch of nothing.

49:13.734 --> 49:16.134
Yeah, when's the last time

49:16.136 --> 49:18.539
they called you in
for just a bunch of nothing?

49:20.474 --> 49:22.643
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

49:27.448 --> 49:28.783
Shit.

49:39.460 --> 49:40.659
<i>What have we got?</i>

49:40.661 --> 49:42.494
We've got 70-plus homeless men

49:42.496 --> 49:45.664
barricaded on the northeast
corner of the third floor.

49:50.871 --> 49:53.873
Now, why would this guy
initiate this action?

49:53.875 --> 49:56.408
Has he got some beef
with the library or...

49:56.410 --> 49:59.211
he's been spending too much time
in the True Crime section?

49:59.213 --> 50:01.947
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, uh, Ernesto.

50:01.949 --> 50:05.685
Yeah, Stuart did not
initiate this. The patrons did.

50:05.687 --> 50:08.320
Mr. Anderson, I'm gonna need
an address for Goodson

50:08.322 --> 50:09.455
so that a judge can issue

50:09.457 --> 50:10.857
a search warrant
for his residence,

50:10.859 --> 50:14.193
try to get some idea
of his state of mind.

50:14.195 --> 50:17.229
Mr. Goodson was recently named
in a lawsuit

50:17.231 --> 50:19.732
brought against the library
in which he and...

50:19.734 --> 50:21.800
Mr. Ramirez
were primary defendants.

50:21.802 --> 50:24.470
We... we settled yesterday.

50:24.472 --> 50:26.705
In the tune of $750,000.

50:26.707 --> 50:29.308
You can read all about it
in the paper on Monday.

50:29.310 --> 50:30.311
Hm.

50:31.912 --> 50:35.381
Stuart Goodson.
What is it with this guy?

50:35.383 --> 50:37.282
He seems hell-bent
on ruining my week.

50:37.284 --> 50:38.851
He thinks
he's saving people's lives

50:38.853 --> 50:40.319
by keeping them out of the cold.

50:40.321 --> 50:42.889
Well, we have shelters
in place for that.

50:42.891 --> 50:45.191
Well, apparently,
not enough of them.

50:48.763 --> 50:49.828
So that's what
this is all about?

50:49.830 --> 50:51.363
It's some sort of exercise

50:51.365 --> 50:53.700
in civil disobedience?

50:53.702 --> 50:56.468
So, we, uh,
send in a tactical team,

50:56.470 --> 50:59.338
battering ram, crash the door,
toss in some tear gas,

50:59.340 --> 51:00.839
arrest 'em all for trespassing,

51:00.841 --> 51:01.840
we're home
before "The Tonight Show."

51:01.842 --> 51:03.410
This is my operation, Davis.

51:03.412 --> 51:05.845
Besides, we don't even know
what they want.

51:05.847 --> 51:07.513
What they want?
Who cares what they want?

51:07.515 --> 51:09.449
This is a public facility,
they're trespassing,

51:09.451 --> 51:10.950
they're breaking the law, we
need to get them out of there!

51:10.952 --> 51:11.985
Well, now,
what are you doin' up here

51:11.987 --> 51:13.585
when the cameras are downstairs?

51:13.587 --> 51:16.321
Excuse me! Do you people know

51:16.323 --> 51:18.390
how to do anything without
the use of excessive force?

51:18.392 --> 51:20.796
This is a public library,
for God's sake.

51:22.396 --> 51:23.732
Yes, sir.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.534
Next station,
Ninth and Walnut,

51:27.536 --> 51:29.270
The Library.

51:39.681 --> 51:40.880
- Hello.
- Hey.

51:40.882 --> 51:42.347
I'm outside of the library

51:42.349 --> 51:43.749
and there are
a lot of cop cars here.

51:43.751 --> 51:45.518
Is everything alright?

51:45.520 --> 51:46.953
Not exactly.

51:46.955 --> 51:49.722
Is this one of your freaky
librarian things?

51:49.724 --> 51:51.024
The patrons have turned
the building

51:51.026 --> 51:53.325
into an emergency
homeless shelter.

51:53.327 --> 51:54.861
Obviously,
there's been some pushback.

51:54.863 --> 51:57.430
Okay, so now is probably
not a great time

51:57.432 --> 51:59.799
to come and get my library card.

51:59.801 --> 52:01.568
You still wanna hang out
with me?

52:01.570 --> 52:03.636
Do you have any idea
how much cooler

52:03.638 --> 52:05.939
you're gonna be
with a criminal record?

52:05.941 --> 52:08.508
Well, I... I kind of
already have one.

52:10.812 --> 52:12.879
I knew deep down
you're a bad boy.

52:12.881 --> 52:15.415
Wow. You know, news trucks
just pulled up.

52:15.417 --> 52:16.516
The news?

52:16.518 --> 52:18.686
You know, you're gonna be on TV.

52:26.928 --> 52:28.828
Good evening,
this is Rebecca Parks

52:28.830 --> 52:31.065
with breaking news
from Downtown Cincinnati

52:31.067 --> 52:34.701
where a situation is unfolding
inside the public library.

52:34.703 --> 52:36.369
Information is sketchy
at this time,

52:36.371 --> 52:38.438
and no details
have been released.

52:38.440 --> 52:41.373
But as you can see,
the Cincinnati Police Department

52:41.375 --> 52:42.809
has been dispatched.

52:42.811 --> 52:45.411
So we don't know
if it's a hostage situation

52:45.413 --> 52:46.846
or an active shooter.

52:46.848 --> 52:48.414
What was that?

52:48.416 --> 52:50.817
To update you on news
as it breaks.

52:50.819 --> 52:53.418
As you know, resources
are already stretched thin

52:53.420 --> 52:56.523
due to the record-breaking cold
weather we are experiencing.

52:56.525 --> 52:59.960
Live and trying to stay warm
from Downtown Public Library.

52:59.962 --> 53:01.861
Well, at least
we're all staying warm.

53:01.863 --> 53:03.563
Back to you
in the studio.

53:03.565 --> 53:05.397
Thank you, Rebeca,
we'll stay

53:05.399 --> 53:07.435
on top of that story
as it develops.

53:10.371 --> 53:11.972
Myra?

53:11.974 --> 53:14.474
The cops? Really?

53:14.476 --> 53:15.875
I can't do this.

53:15.877 --> 53:18.444
I... I have... I have
the worst feeling about this.

53:18.446 --> 53:19.779
- I have to get out of here.
- Hold on. Hold on.

53:19.781 --> 53:21.514
This is totally
in your wheelhouse.

53:21.516 --> 53:23.449
<i>You're the one who's always
like, "Vive la Resistance!"</i>

53:23.451 --> 53:24.852
I wish
this was in my wheelhouse!

53:24.854 --> 53:26.619
This is bigger
than riding the metro

53:26.621 --> 53:28.588
and getting organic food.

53:28.590 --> 53:31.457
I am not prepared to be
in a standoff with a cop.

53:31.459 --> 53:34.426
I can't do that.
I don't know how to do that.

53:34.428 --> 53:36.997
- Please, just understand me.
- Okay.

53:36.999 --> 53:40.433
My mom's gonna watch that.
She is not well.

53:40.435 --> 53:43.137
You know that. It is not gonna
be good for her to see that.

53:43.139 --> 53:45.405
I get it.

53:45.407 --> 53:46.374
And...

53:47.609 --> 53:49.544
we're gonna get you out of here.

53:51.479 --> 53:52.780
How?

54:01.057 --> 54:03.858
You gonna answer that,
Mr. Goodson?

54:03.860 --> 54:07.063
- Why don't you?
- Well, I don't work here.

54:19.608 --> 54:22.076
- Hello?
- What are you doing in there?

54:22.078 --> 54:24.846
- Who is this?
- Is this Stuart Goodson?

54:26.548 --> 54:28.716
It is.

54:28.718 --> 54:32.121
This is Detective Bill Ramstead
from the Cincinnati PD.

54:33.990 --> 54:37.059
- Hello, detective.
- Why don't you call me Bill?

54:38.227 --> 54:40.694
Why don't I call you
William?

54:40.696 --> 54:43.596
Only my mother calls me William.

54:43.598 --> 54:45.165
May I call you Stuart?

54:45.167 --> 54:47.435
Only my friends call me Stuart.

54:49.105 --> 54:52.806
A lot of your friends out here
are worried about you, buddy.

54:52.808 --> 54:54.174
They'd like to see
this situation

54:54.176 --> 54:56.477
resolve itself peacefully.

54:56.479 --> 54:59.081
Tell him, tell him this is
a peaceful demonstration.

55:00.883 --> 55:03.017
This is
a peaceful demonstration.

55:03.019 --> 55:05.719
So no one's being held
against their will?

55:05.721 --> 55:08.624
No. Everyone is here
because they wanna be here.

55:10.159 --> 55:13.527
Everyone is here
because they wanna be here.

55:13.529 --> 55:16.964
Would it be safe to assume
that some are not of, uh,

55:16.966 --> 55:18.665
sound mind?

55:18.667 --> 55:20.634
Uh, I mean, you don't need
to be mentally ill

55:20.636 --> 55:22.838
to know that it's freezing
outside, detective.

55:23.873 --> 55:25.240
That was good, man.

55:25.242 --> 55:27.975
So why'd you barricade
the doors?

55:27.977 --> 55:29.843
[whispers To make it hard
for you mo-fuckers

55:29.845 --> 55:32.780
to get in here to take us out.

55:32.782 --> 55:34.850
You can say it. Yeah.

55:36.786 --> 55:37.985
Go on, say that. Say that.

55:37.987 --> 55:41.121
To... to make it harder on you...

55:41.123 --> 55:45.260
mo-fos to get in here
and take us out.

55:47.930 --> 55:49.530
Look, you make it harder on us,

55:49.532 --> 55:51.231
we're gonna have to make it
harder on you, brother.

55:51.233 --> 55:53.901
And sooner or later, you're
gonna have to open that door.

55:53.903 --> 55:57.004
Well, tell him we plan to open
the doors first thing tomor...

55:57.006 --> 55:58.605
Look, why don't you just
hand the phone

55:58.607 --> 56:00.007
to the guy that's doin'
all the talking?

56:00.009 --> 56:03.143
It will be a real timesaver,
okay?

56:03.145 --> 56:06.214
No, I don't wanna talk
to the police.

56:06.216 --> 56:08.716
He says he doesn't
wanna talk to the police.

56:08.718 --> 56:11.886
Yeah, yeah, I heard him.

56:11.888 --> 56:14.189
Look, Goodson,
do you have any idea

56:14.191 --> 56:16.156
what the hell
you're doin' in there?

56:16.158 --> 56:19.029
And how much trouble you're all
gonna be in for this stunt?

56:24.633 --> 56:27.634
Um, "We need the library

56:27.636 --> 56:29.304
to remain open
as an emergency shelter

56:29.306 --> 56:31.239
for the duration
of the cold spell.

56:31.241 --> 56:34.143
Or provide us
with a reasonable facility."

56:36.346 --> 56:38.914
Now what are you gonna
give me in return?

56:40.349 --> 56:42.083
We're negotiating?

56:42.085 --> 56:45.253
That's what they pay me for,
buddy.

56:45.255 --> 56:47.523
We don't have
anything to give you.

56:49.825 --> 56:51.660
Well, why don't you just quit?

56:53.263 --> 56:55.698
Come on out now
before anybody gets hurt.

56:57.267 --> 57:00.003
Which is what you should do,
Goodson!

57:02.172 --> 57:06.174
- That sounds like Davis.
- Goddamn right it is!

57:06.176 --> 57:08.143
You still wearing
that cheap cologne?

57:08.145 --> 57:09.209
- Everybody...
- Son of a bitch!

57:09.211 --> 57:11.212
Everybody, calm down. Just...

57:11.214 --> 57:12.949
Please, calm down.

57:15.684 --> 57:17.087
Goodson.

57:19.089 --> 57:20.956
You still there, Goodson?

57:26.962 --> 57:28.331
Here's our demand.

57:29.933 --> 57:34.237
I want Davis to go outside.

57:35.005 --> 57:37.038
Outside?

57:37.040 --> 57:38.173
That's right.

57:38.175 --> 57:41.109
I want Davis to go outside

57:41.111 --> 57:43.278
in front of the library

57:43.280 --> 57:46.981
to lay down on the concrete

57:46.983 --> 57:49.417
for five minutes.

57:49.419 --> 57:50.987
No blankets.

57:56.860 --> 57:59.196
I guess you're gonna miss
"The Tonight Show."

58:05.168 --> 58:08.001
Civil disobedience, my ass.

58:08.003 --> 58:10.107
This is petty revenge.

58:18.814 --> 58:21.051
That's a pretty odd demand.

58:23.386 --> 58:24.787
Um...

58:26.756 --> 58:28.692
Mr. Goodson, you okay?

58:31.862 --> 58:33.761
Stuart?

58:37.968 --> 58:39.234
Hi.

58:39.236 --> 58:41.803
Can you do me a favor
and just, uh,

58:41.805 --> 58:44.306
keep the press back
for about five minutes?

59:00.290 --> 59:03.191
Josh,
Rebecca Parks with WCBO.

59:03.193 --> 59:05.193
What are you doing, sir?

59:05.195 --> 59:08.029
Can you tell us what's
happening inside the library?

59:08.031 --> 59:10.899
Is there an emergency
inside the building?

59:15.339 --> 59:17.105
Hi, yeah.
Jim and Carol.

59:17.107 --> 59:18.274
<i>We're still live at the scene</i>

59:18.276 --> 59:20.942
<i>at the Downtown branch
of the public library</i>

59:20.944 --> 59:23.979
<i>where Hamilton County
prosecutor Josh Davis</i>

59:23.981 --> 59:26.981
<i>has emerged from the building
and for some unknown reason...</i>

59:26.983 --> 59:31.187
He's doin' it. He's actually
laying on the pavement.

59:31.189 --> 59:34.456
- That's awesome.
- You sure about that?

59:34.458 --> 59:37.959
<i>Bizarre and crazy
are certainly two words</i>

59:37.961 --> 59:40.261
<i>I would use to describe this.</i>

59:40.263 --> 59:44.166
<i>Strange live images
to you at home.</i>

59:44.168 --> 59:47.036
<i>Many of you know Josh Davis
has announced his plans</i>

59:47.038 --> 59:49.205
<i>to run for mayor of Cincinnati.</i>

59:49.207 --> 59:51.806
<i>So I'm sure he'll have
some explanation</i>

59:51.808 --> 59:54.410
<i>for us and for the viewers
of this city</i>

59:54.412 --> 59:57.513
<i>as to just what the heck
is going on here.</i>

59:57.515 --> 01:00:00.950
Son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch.

01:00:07.824 --> 01:00:10.926
Okay, I'll answer all your
questions in just a moment.

01:00:12.263 --> 01:00:15.497
Well, we can all agree that, uh,

01:00:15.499 --> 01:00:19.034
what we've just witnessed
was an irrational act,

01:00:19.036 --> 01:00:20.502
especially considering the, uh,

01:00:20.504 --> 01:00:21.971
extreme temperatures
this evening,

01:00:21.973 --> 01:00:24.940
but I want to assure
all of you that, uh,

01:00:24.942 --> 01:00:28.010
and the people of Cincinnati
that I am not mad.

01:00:28.012 --> 01:00:29.912
The only madness tonight

01:00:29.914 --> 01:00:33.916
comes in the form
of one particular individual

01:00:33.918 --> 01:00:36.452
who has seized control

01:00:36.454 --> 01:00:39.888
of one of our most
respected institutions.

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:42.491
Now without getting
into details,

01:00:42.493 --> 01:00:46.061
this individual is an employee
of the public library,

01:00:46.063 --> 01:00:48.530
and as we've tried to negotiate
in a peaceful manner

01:00:48.532 --> 01:00:50.165
with this individual,
we were presented

01:00:50.167 --> 01:00:53.902
with a, a list of demands,
one of which was an order for me

01:00:53.904 --> 01:00:58.040
to lay outside in front
of the building on the street

01:00:58.042 --> 01:00:59.575
for a period of five minutes.

01:00:59.577 --> 01:01:01.310
Did the suspect say
why he wanted you

01:01:01.312 --> 01:01:03.078
to lie down in the street?

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.248
Well, obviously, he's, uh,

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:09.586
he's disturbed in some way.
I mean, he may be mentally ill.

01:01:09.588 --> 01:01:11.920
We're, uh, we're still
investigating that.

01:01:11.922 --> 01:01:15.224
- Is the suspect armed?
- Uh, is he armed?

01:01:15.226 --> 01:01:18.494
Well, my experience
would tell me that, uh,

01:01:18.496 --> 01:01:22.865
this individual would have
a hard time detaining 100 people

01:01:22.867 --> 01:01:26.935
if he wasn't armed
with... with some kind of weapon.

01:01:26.937 --> 01:01:29.004
Thank you very much,
we're trying to resolve

01:01:29.006 --> 01:01:30.439
this situation as calmly

01:01:30.441 --> 01:01:32.575
and as peacefully
as we possibly can.

01:01:32.577 --> 01:01:34.477
Oh, great.

01:01:34.479 --> 01:01:36.211
You have a gun. Mr. Goodson?

01:01:36.213 --> 01:01:38.350
Of course, he doesn't, Ray.

01:01:42.019 --> 01:01:43.986
You don't, do you?

01:01:43.988 --> 01:01:47.289
I've never even
held a gun, Smutts.

01:01:56.068 --> 01:01:58.167
Hey, buddy. Kill 'em all.

01:01:58.169 --> 01:02:00.970
- Let God sort 'em out.
- Have a nice night. sir.

01:02:00.972 --> 01:02:03.373
You hear me?
Kill 'em all.

01:02:03.375 --> 01:02:05.541
Who... who was that?

01:02:05.543 --> 01:02:07.477
It's a wrong number.

01:02:12.316 --> 01:02:14.684
This is Ramstead.
I'm gonna try to control

01:02:14.686 --> 01:02:17.219
the incoming calls,
keep the crackpots at bay.

01:02:17.221 --> 01:02:19.988
Well, you can start with Davis.
Why is he telling the press

01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:21.591
that this is
a hostage situation?

01:02:21.593 --> 01:02:23.525
Goodson, you're the one
who told him

01:02:23.527 --> 01:02:25.528
to go outside
and lie on the ground.

01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:26.995
The guy wants to be mayor,
he doesn't have a clue

01:02:26.997 --> 01:02:28.531
what's going on
in his own damn city.

01:02:28.533 --> 01:02:31.301
- Goodson...
- Nobody in here has a weapon!

01:02:31.303 --> 01:02:33.001
You gotta calm down.

01:02:33.003 --> 01:02:35.070
Why are you guys
treating me like I'm a suspect?

01:02:35.072 --> 01:02:36.339
This thing isn't about me!

01:02:36.341 --> 01:02:37.607
What about
your apartment?

01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:39.642
My apartment?
What about it?

01:02:39.644 --> 01:02:42.045
We have a warrant. Now
you tell me are we gonna find

01:02:42.047 --> 01:02:45.281
anything funny
when we get inside there?

01:02:45.283 --> 01:02:47.149
Funny?

01:02:47.151 --> 01:02:50.120
You mean like a... a booby trap?

01:02:50.122 --> 01:02:52.421
Or a circus clown?

01:02:52.423 --> 01:02:54.090
Uh, uh, Mr. Goodson,
we gotta keep...

01:02:54.092 --> 01:02:56.461
Don't you see
what they're trying to do here?

01:03:04.469 --> 01:03:07.036
- I have to ask.
- I'm a librarian.

01:03:07.038 --> 01:03:09.539
And you got a lot
of nervous people out here.

01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:11.307
What the hell do you guys
have to be nervous about?

01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:13.576
You got all the guns.

01:03:13.578 --> 01:03:16.313
Are you on any drugs
or medication right now?

01:03:17.683 --> 01:03:21.386
Not at the moment, detective,
but what are you sellin'?

01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:27.024
Maybe I better take
the rest of the calls.

01:03:28.694 --> 01:03:31.129
You're probably gonna
get us all killed.

01:03:41.206 --> 01:03:42.707
Yeah.

01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:54.117
That was quite
a campaign speech.

01:03:54.119 --> 01:03:56.519
And that, my friends,
was a lesson

01:03:56.521 --> 01:03:58.388
in how you sway public opinion.

01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:59.723
Fake news?

01:03:59.725 --> 01:04:01.791
I created a narrative
which allows us

01:04:01.793 --> 01:04:03.694
to bring this situation
to a close.

01:04:03.696 --> 01:04:06.329
Not next week or a month
from now but tonight.

01:04:06.331 --> 01:04:07.632
This evenin'.

01:04:12.637 --> 01:04:15.006
Don't everybody
thank me at once.

01:04:21.213 --> 01:04:22.813
Are you mentally unstable?

01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:25.248
Listen, Davis is trying
to spin this story

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:26.584
to make me look crazy.

01:04:26.586 --> 01:04:28.218
This is
a peaceful demonstration.

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:30.653
Okay,
so you need to tell your side.

01:04:30.655 --> 01:04:32.022
How?

01:04:33.158 --> 01:04:35.325
You need to get on TV...

01:04:35.327 --> 01:04:37.760
or you need to get
on the phone with a reporter.

01:04:37.762 --> 01:04:40.598
Because if people see something
on TV, they believe it's true.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.131
I can't go
on television.

01:04:42.133 --> 01:04:44.568
Stuart, get some photos
or videos

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:46.302
and send them to me.

01:04:46.304 --> 01:04:48.204
Video of what?

01:04:48.206 --> 01:04:50.808
Whatever. Whatever's really
happening in there, okay?

01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:53.409
- Help!
- Stuart?

01:04:53.411 --> 01:04:55.345
Hey. Hello... Hello?

01:05:06.825 --> 01:05:10.494
Can someone call 911?
Stuart, could you call 9-1-1?

01:05:10.496 --> 01:05:12.829
- He's having a seizure.
- Got it.

01:05:12.831 --> 01:05:15.198
Can I have your coat, please?

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.168
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:05:18.303 --> 01:05:20.304
It's okay.

01:05:23.308 --> 01:05:25.209
Hold on.

01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:27.176
Yeah, we have
a medical emergency in here.

01:05:27.178 --> 01:05:29.713
We have a man down.
We're calling for a truce.

01:05:29.715 --> 01:05:32.118
I'm calling for a truce
to get him out.

01:05:49.802 --> 01:05:52.469
Hey, be cool in here.

01:05:52.471 --> 01:05:55.274
I don't wanna be coming back
to take you out on one of these.

01:05:56.842 --> 01:05:59.610
- Sorry, Myra.
- Don't apologize.

01:05:59.612 --> 01:06:02.748
Just... I'm gonna see you soon,
okay?

01:06:13.793 --> 01:06:15.426
You the detective
I've been talking to?

01:06:15.428 --> 01:06:17.394
That's right.

01:06:17.396 --> 01:06:19.730
You're in poor company.

01:06:19.732 --> 01:06:21.465
Coming from the guy
who's got himself locked down

01:06:21.467 --> 01:06:22.767
in a room full of bums.

01:06:22.769 --> 01:06:24.368
Ah, you'd fit right in.

01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:25.502
Goodson,
you got the doors open.

01:06:25.504 --> 01:06:26.704
Now this is an opportunity
for you

01:06:26.706 --> 01:06:28.840
to stand down,
end this right now.

01:06:28.842 --> 01:06:32.476
You want us out?
Give us somewhere to go.

01:06:32.478 --> 01:06:34.613
How about we all go
to your place?

01:06:34.615 --> 01:06:36.847
Well, my ex-wife got the house
in Mount Adams,

01:06:36.849 --> 01:06:39.251
so I'd love to see
everybody go over there.

01:06:41.722 --> 01:06:44.188
I'm gonna go, uh,
bring in some food.

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:46.323
I'll call in an order
and pay for it.

01:06:46.325 --> 01:06:48.659
I'm gonna have to run
that request up the flagpole.

01:06:48.661 --> 01:06:49.860
Well, you run it up the flagpole

01:06:49.862 --> 01:06:51.362
and across the street
to LaRosa's.

01:06:51.364 --> 01:06:52.664
Are we negotiating now?

01:06:52.666 --> 01:06:55.134
That's what they pay you for.

01:06:59.338 --> 01:07:01.305
- Uh, wait a second.
- Wh... what are you doing?

01:07:01.307 --> 01:07:03.273
Stop! You stop!
What about our truce?

01:07:03.275 --> 01:07:06.178
Hey, take it easy.
I'm not going for my weapon.

01:07:15.656 --> 01:07:17.588
Anybody that look like him
in there tonight?

01:07:21.395 --> 01:07:23.995
- Is that your son?
- Yeah.

01:07:23.997 --> 01:07:27.866
- What's his name?
- Michael. Mike.

01:07:27.868 --> 01:07:30.336
I thought he might be in there.

01:07:31.437 --> 01:07:33.672
I haven't seen him.

01:07:33.674 --> 01:07:35.842
Oh, you hang on to it.

01:08:17.483 --> 01:08:21.419
This is what we netted from the
search of Goodson's apartment.

01:08:21.421 --> 01:08:24.223
And he has a series of priors.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.626
"Drunk and disorderly,
resisting arrest

01:08:29.627 --> 01:08:31.729

01:08:31.732 --> 01:08:33.398
trespassing."

01:08:35.334 --> 01:08:37.702
From this sheet, it sounds like
this guy was on the streets.

01:08:37.703 --> 01:08:39.005
He was.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.474
- And you hired him, anyway?
- I did.

01:08:42.475 --> 01:08:44.908
He's been sober for a number
of years, earned his degree

01:08:44.911 --> 01:08:46.578
and worked harder than anyone
I've ever seen

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.247
to get himself right.

01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:52.384
Library gave him
a second chance.

01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:57.323

And she wants to go out
on a date with me.

01:09:46.006 --> 01:09:47.438
She's from around here too.

She thinks I'm a pilot.

Smutts is online right now

01:10:33.754 --> 01:10:35.120
trying to get a date?

01:10:35.122 --> 01:10:38.623
That's what he does
every day, Mr. Goodson.

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:40.928
Has he ever hooked up?

01:10:47.634 --> 01:10:49.801

01:10:49.803 --> 01:10:52.773
You ever dream about
getting off the street?

01:10:56.711 --> 01:10:59.678
No, not really.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.048
I mean, there's a certain
freedom out there.

01:11:15.029 --> 01:11:17.162
I mean, you know...

01:11:17.164 --> 01:11:19.567
I may not have money
and stuff...

01:11:22.036 --> 01:11:23.769
but on the other hand,
I don't have anything

01:11:23.771 --> 01:11:26.841
that anybody wants
or could take.

01:11:29.677 --> 01:11:31.078
Now that's freedom.

01:11:32.546 --> 01:11:34.947
So why do all this?

01:11:34.949 --> 01:11:37.783
For who? For what?

01:11:37.785 --> 01:11:40.488
To shake the tree.

01:11:42.958 --> 01:11:45.159

that we still matter.

01:11:47.728 --> 01:11:49.897
God gives us all a voice.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:54.201

01:12:06.248 --> 01:12:08.081
They'll forget all about this
by tomorrow.

01:12:08.083 --> 01:12:11.118
No. Maybe, maybe not.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.922

Yeah, you know, you don't

- Five years.
- Mm.

01:14:26.688 --> 01:14:28.288

that only a pizza guy
would know?

01:16:22.405 --> 01:16:25.107
How much do you charge
for a... a plain cheese pizza?

01:16:28.478 --> 01:16:30.344
Medium or large?

01:16:30.346 --> 01:16:32.546
- Medium.
- 9.50.

01:16:32.548 --> 01:16:36.183
And if I wanna add
fresh tomatoes and basil?

01:16:36.185 --> 01:16:39.353
- 12.50.
- He's legit.

01:16:46.362 --> 01:16:48.562
Damn it, Chip.
Close the door!

01:16:48.564 --> 01:16:50.364
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

01:16:50.366 --> 01:16:51.533
Honey, look, we're about
to go live.

01:16:51.535 --> 01:16:53.067
I don't have the time.
Sorry, doll.

01:16:53.069 --> 01:16:54.101
I was wondering if you wanted

01:16:54.103 --> 01:16:55.369
to have contact with my friend

01:16:55.371 --> 01:16:56.836
who's in the middle
of the situation inside,

01:16:56.838 --> 01:16:59.240
but since you're being
such a bitch,

01:16:59.242 --> 01:17:00.407
I'm gonna have to find
somebody else...

01:17:00.409 --> 01:17:02.309
No, no, no.
Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am.

01:17:02.311 --> 01:17:05.145
- What's your name?
- Uh, I'm Angela.

01:17:05.147 --> 01:17:07.081
- Angela.
- Yeah.

01:17:07.083 --> 01:17:09.016
Hey.

01:17:09.018 --> 01:17:10.985
I've had an impossible day.

01:17:10.987 --> 01:17:13.888
Really? Did your manicurist
cancel on you?

01:17:15.858 --> 01:17:18.125
I deserve that.

01:17:18.127 --> 01:17:20.828
You said
you had a friend inside?

01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:22.464
- Yeah.
- Inside the room with hostages?

01:17:22.466 --> 01:17:25.032
They're not hostages.

01:17:25.034 --> 01:17:27.935
And I have video to prove it.

01:17:51.127 --> 01:17:54.928
Thought we weren't allowed to
eat in the library, Mr. Goodson?

01:17:54.930 --> 01:17:56.799
Just tonight, Ray.

01:18:01.305 --> 01:18:04.204
Only one piece, Big George?

01:18:04.206 --> 01:18:06.942
I'm practicing portion control.

01:18:12.315 --> 01:18:14.382
- Yo, what you doin', man?
- Hey, yo!

01:18:14.384 --> 01:18:16.518
Hey, give me that!
You can't take that!

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.052
Hey, just takin'
what's mine, man.

01:18:18.054 --> 01:18:20.355
Quit being an asshole,
man! Come on!

01:19:04.266 --> 01:19:06.401
And what's the downside
of letting them

01:19:06.403 --> 01:19:08.503
stay put here tonight,
or if not that,

01:19:08.505 --> 01:19:10.204
finding them
an alternative shelter?

01:19:10.206 --> 01:19:12.040
I mean, wha... what's the cost?

01:19:12.042 --> 01:19:13.475
Busses to transport them to it?

01:19:13.477 --> 01:19:16.578
It opens the door
to every nutcase with a cause

01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:18.849
to hold this city hostage.

01:19:20.049 --> 01:19:21.549
This is a disrupter.

01:19:21.551 --> 01:19:25.320
The Cincinnati PD
has effective protocols in place

01:19:25.322 --> 01:19:27.154
to neutralize this.

01:19:27.156 --> 01:19:30.358
It's not always pretty,
but it gets the job done.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.559
So you're saying we go in there

01:19:31.561 --> 01:19:35.664
and we teargas
100 homeless people?

01:19:35.666 --> 01:19:38.333
That would make one hell
of a campaign ad.

01:19:38.335 --> 01:19:40.669
"Vote for Davis
or he'll teargas you."

01:19:40.671 --> 01:19:42.537
You... you... you know,
I'm not trying to diminish

01:19:42.539 --> 01:19:44.339
the severity
of the situation here

01:19:44.341 --> 01:19:48.176
or... or what it is that you do,
but, uh...

01:19:48.178 --> 01:19:51.346
Stuart Goodson is no nutcase.

01:19:51.348 --> 01:19:53.649
It is my job to uphold the law

01:19:53.651 --> 01:19:55.617
and protect democracy
in this city.

01:19:55.619 --> 01:19:58.420
You know,
I devoted my entire life

01:19:58.422 --> 01:20:00.321
to preserving
the freedom of information

01:20:00.323 --> 01:20:01.656
that flows
in and out of this institution.

01:20:01.658 --> 01:20:04.493
The public library
is the last bastion

01:20:04.495 --> 01:20:06.194
of true democracy
that we have in this country,

01:20:06.196 --> 01:20:08.129
and I'll be damned
if I'm gonna sit here

01:20:08.131 --> 01:20:11.635
and let you thugs
turn it into a battlefield.

01:20:20.377 --> 01:20:23.278
Well, if we're not gonna get
kinky and start waterboarding,

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.916
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna go.

01:20:31.288 --> 01:20:32.657
Hey...

01:20:34.625 --> 01:20:38.259
try not to... kill
any of my friends tonight.

01:20:53.778 --> 01:20:55.443
- Hey, Rebecca?
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:20:55.445 --> 01:20:59.247
This just in.
Wait for it, Chip.

01:20:59.249 --> 01:21:01.449
Our next feed is going national.

01:21:01.451 --> 01:21:03.151
Oh, cool.

01:21:03.153 --> 01:21:04.787
Oh, wait, wait.
My Twitter feed is blowing up.

01:21:04.789 --> 01:21:07.523
I've got 3000 new followers
since this story broke.

01:21:07.525 --> 01:21:09.057
- Chip, this is huge.
- Great.

01:21:09.059 --> 01:21:10.826
Listen, um,
based on what I'm seeing

01:21:10.828 --> 01:21:13.762
in these video clips here,
uh, there doesn't appear to be

01:21:13.764 --> 01:21:16.799
anything more than
a demonstration going on inside.

01:21:16.801 --> 01:21:20.071
- What? Hm?
- Take a look.

01:21:24.574 --> 01:21:27.043
There's no evidence
of any threat.

01:21:28.078 --> 01:21:29.377
I think there is.

01:21:29.379 --> 01:21:32.114
What are you seeing
that I'm not?

01:21:32.116 --> 01:21:34.082
There are more eyeballs
tuned in to this story

01:21:34.084 --> 01:21:37.253
than anything we've covered
in the last six months.

01:21:37.255 --> 01:21:39.423
That's what I'm seeing, Chip.

01:21:43.828 --> 01:21:46.162
Oh.

01:22:21.365 --> 01:22:23.432
- Who's that?
- Did you hear that?

01:22:29.273 --> 01:22:31.140
Mr. Anderson.

01:22:31.142 --> 01:22:33.711
I'm not here
to try to talk you out.

01:22:44.622 --> 01:22:46.491
Let him in.

01:22:51.429 --> 01:22:53.763
What's goin' on?

01:22:53.765 --> 01:22:55.266
Hey.

01:23:13.284 --> 01:23:15.754
Yeah. Kumbaya.

01:23:39.544 --> 01:23:41.145
Hi.

01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:01.265
- Anybody sittin' here?
- Go ahead.

01:24:05.403 --> 01:24:07.837
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:24:07.839 --> 01:24:09.673
Did you get those pictures
and the videos I sent?

01:24:09.675 --> 01:24:12.775
I did.
Are you ready for your close-up?

01:24:12.777 --> 01:24:16.579
- What do I say?
- You say the truth.

01:24:16.581 --> 01:24:18.614
Hi.

01:24:18.616 --> 01:24:20.316
Hi, did you get the clips
I sent you?

01:24:20.318 --> 01:24:21.985
- I did. I did.
- Okay.

01:24:21.987 --> 01:24:23.853
The guy's a friend of yours?

01:24:23.855 --> 01:24:25.455
Yeah, I mean, well, we live
in the same building,

01:24:25.457 --> 01:24:27.257
but you saw what's really
going on in there, right?

01:24:27.259 --> 01:24:29.627
I did. I said I did,
so I must have, right?

01:24:30.962 --> 01:24:31.861
Yeah.

01:24:31.863 --> 01:24:33.863
- Angela.
- Uh-huh.

01:24:33.865 --> 01:24:37.701
These things
very rarely end well, okay?

01:24:37.703 --> 01:24:39.803
So why don't you
just stick around, stay close,

01:24:39.805 --> 01:24:42.638
and in case this barrel
of monkeys goes sideways,

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.810
we can get you on
for an interview.

01:24:46.044 --> 01:24:47.576
Thanks.

01:24:52.316 --> 01:24:55.220
Okay.
Chip, we got him patched in?

01:24:56.021 --> 01:24:58.320
Great. Okay.

01:24:58.322 --> 01:25:00.356
- Stuart?
- Uh, yes. That's me.

01:25:00.358 --> 01:25:03.760
Hi.
This is Rebecca Parks from WCBO.

01:25:03.762 --> 01:25:06.296
How are you doing in there?

01:25:06.298 --> 01:25:08.498
Well, uh, I... I'd be
a hell of a lot better

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:11.333
if you people in the media
would get your facts straight

01:25:11.335 --> 01:25:12.736
before you start
spreading misinformation

01:25:12.738 --> 01:25:14.071
with your broadcast.

01:25:14.073 --> 01:25:16.405
Hey, thank you so much
for this exclusive.

01:25:16.407 --> 01:25:18.376
Alright, Chip. We good?

01:25:29.554 --> 01:25:33.022
We have breaking news
out of Cincinnati, Ohio, tonight

01:25:33.024 --> 01:25:35.760
where it appears
a hostage situation

01:25:35.762 --> 01:25:38.394
in a downtown library
has been going on

01:25:38.396 --> 01:25:40.395
for the better part
of the night.

01:25:40.397 --> 01:25:42.967
We're gonna take you there live
to our Cincinnati affiliate...

01:25:42.969 --> 01:25:45.101
Would you mind clearing
my eye line, honey? Chip?

01:25:45.103 --> 01:25:47.772
Rebecca Parks
has been covering the scene

01:25:47.774 --> 01:25:50.006
since it began. Rebecca?

01:25:50.008 --> 01:25:52.676
That's right,
we do have a breaking news,

01:25:52.678 --> 01:25:54.912
a WCBO exclusive,

01:25:54.914 --> 01:25:58.081
outside the extremely chilly
central library

01:25:58.083 --> 01:26:01.918
which has been on lockdown since
about 6 o'clock this evening.

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.387
A newly released information
about this situation

01:26:04.389 --> 01:26:07.690
is the man
responsible for the lockdown

01:26:07.692 --> 01:26:10.027
has a criminal past.

01:26:10.029 --> 01:26:13.530
We have obtained some images
from inside the building

01:26:13.532 --> 01:26:15.835
that are exclusive to us.

01:26:21.641 --> 01:26:23.042
Hi, mom.

01:26:26.845 --> 01:26:28.846
What the...
How did they get this footage?

01:26:28.848 --> 01:26:30.580
Where are they getting
this footage from?

01:26:30.582 --> 01:26:32.749
And now, on the phone,

01:26:32.751 --> 01:26:34.685
we have with us
Mr. Stuart Goodson

01:26:34.687 --> 01:26:38.122
who many believe is
the instigator for the lockdown,

01:26:38.124 --> 01:26:41.424
and some say is holding
over 100 people

01:26:41.426 --> 01:26:43.927
inside the library
against their will.

01:26:43.929 --> 01:26:45.763
Mr. Goodson, are you there, sir?

01:26:45.765 --> 01:26:47.097
Yeah, I am.

01:26:47.099 --> 01:26:48.899
You're a city librarian,
is that correct?

01:26:48.901 --> 01:26:51.602
- A supervisor?
- Yes, that's right.

01:26:51.604 --> 01:26:53.671
Are officials correct
in the assumption

01:26:53.673 --> 01:26:57.441
that you are indeed holding
people against their will?

01:26:57.443 --> 01:26:59.844
Of course not. No, tha... that
is absolutely false.

01:26:59.846 --> 01:27:02.613
So this is not
a hostage situation?

01:27:02.615 --> 01:27:04.014
It never was.

01:27:04.016 --> 01:27:06.816
Well, there seems to be
a whole lot of confusion about

01:27:06.818 --> 01:27:10.120
what exactly is going on inside
the building, Mr. Goodson.

01:27:10.122 --> 01:27:12.156
Now a source
inside the police department

01:27:12.158 --> 01:27:15.459
has confirmed that you've had
quite a few brushes

01:27:15.461 --> 01:27:17.460
with law enforcement
in the past,

01:27:17.462 --> 01:27:20.030
and that you yourself
were, in fact, homeless

01:27:20.032 --> 01:27:22.568
and living on the street
some years ago.

01:27:28.808 --> 01:27:29.940
Okay.

01:27:29.942 --> 01:27:32.411
Would you care to comment
on that?

01:27:33.679 --> 01:27:35.980
You just did.

01:27:35.982 --> 01:27:37.915
Well, I'm... I'm simply
trying to clarify

01:27:37.917 --> 01:27:40.918
for our viewers at home
what's happening in there.

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.821
This is
a humanitarian crisis

01:27:43.823 --> 01:27:46.190
that's happening
in our own city.

01:27:46.192 --> 01:27:48.625
This is not some problem
that's gonna be solved

01:27:48.627 --> 01:27:51.061
with a community bake sale.

01:27:51.063 --> 01:27:53.898
That's my line.

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.733
Well, I'm... I'm hoping
that you can

01:27:55.735 --> 01:27:58.068
shed a little light on it
and... and give us all

01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:00.939
some context here, Mr. Goodson.

01:28:00.941 --> 01:28:03.542
- Context?
- Yes, that's right.

01:28:08.215 --> 01:28:09.482
Context.

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:20.559
"There is a, uh...

01:28:22.161 --> 01:28:26.264
a crime here
that goes beyond denunciation.

01:28:26.266 --> 01:28:28.999
There is a...

01:28:29.001 --> 01:28:32.836
a sorrow here
that weeping cannot symbolize.

01:28:32.838 --> 01:28:35.105
There is a failure here

01:28:35.107 --> 01:28:38.444
that topples all our success."

01:28:40.947 --> 01:28:42.846
What is he saying?
What is he talking about?

01:28:42.848 --> 01:28:45.250
Okay, a failure, Mr. Goodson.

01:28:45.252 --> 01:28:47.955
Can you elaborate
on that a bit?

01:28:49.922 --> 01:28:51.889
"The fertile earth,

01:28:51.891 --> 01:28:54.591
the straight tree rows,

01:28:54.593 --> 01:28:57.594
the sturdy trunks
and the ripe fruit,

01:28:57.596 --> 01:28:59.998
and in the eyes of the people,
there is a failure,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.067
and in the eyes of the hungry,
there is a...

01:29:03.069 --> 01:29:05.072
a growing wrath."

01:29:12.045 --> 01:29:14.212
Okay, so you're saying

01:29:14.214 --> 01:29:18.049
my goodness,
the people inside are angry.

01:29:18.051 --> 01:29:19.616
Is that right?

01:29:19.618 --> 01:29:22.887
"In the soul
of the people,

01:29:22.889 --> 01:29:25.756
the grapes of wrath
are filling

01:29:25.758 --> 01:29:28.660
and growing heavy...

01:29:28.662 --> 01:29:30.663
growing heavy for the vintage."

01:29:39.706 --> 01:29:41.306
Well...

01:29:41.308 --> 01:29:45.042
some interesting words
from inside the central library

01:29:45.044 --> 01:29:46.778
here in Downtown Cincinnati

01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:49.247
where we still have
a lockdown situation

01:29:49.249 --> 01:29:53.086
that doesn't appear to be
ending... anytime soon.

01:29:58.191 --> 01:30:00.824
Damn it. You put me on the phone
with a lunatic.

01:30:00.826 --> 01:30:03.595
Hello? You set me up!

01:30:03.597 --> 01:30:06.264
That was John Steinbeck.
"Grapes of Wrath."

01:30:06.266 --> 01:30:09.301
It's required tenth grade
reading material.

01:30:09.303 --> 01:30:10.969
And if that doesn't prove to you

01:30:10.971 --> 01:30:12.636
that this is not
a hostage situation,

01:30:12.638 --> 01:30:14.806
I don't think
that you're qualified

01:30:14.808 --> 01:30:17.010
to report even the weather.

01:30:25.951 --> 01:30:27.187
Chip.

01:30:30.689 --> 01:30:32.060
Sweet.

01:30:41.802 --> 01:30:43.170
Good words.

01:30:46.106 --> 01:30:48.339
I wish they'd been mine.

01:30:48.341 --> 01:30:50.942
Well, they are yours, Stuart.

01:30:50.944 --> 01:30:53.246
And mine. And theirs.

01:30:56.084 --> 01:30:58.149
They belong to all of us.

01:31:22.676 --> 01:31:24.811
What do you think's
gonna happen to us, man?

01:31:26.046 --> 01:31:28.880
We all going to jail tonight?

01:31:28.882 --> 01:31:33.186
They'll probably get us
for trespassin' and resistin'.

01:31:34.888 --> 01:31:36.721
I've never been to jail.

01:31:38.692 --> 01:31:42.027
That's 'cause you ain't been on
the street long enough, George

01:31:42.029 --> 01:31:44.332
- Give it time.
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

01:31:46.166 --> 01:31:48.766
But I'm not a criminal.

01:31:48.768 --> 01:31:50.670
None of us are, brother.

01:31:51.771 --> 01:31:54.175
Never broken God's law
in my life.

01:31:55.143 --> 01:31:57.175
Always did right.

01:31:57.177 --> 01:31:58.877
Served my country,

01:31:58.879 --> 01:32:00.412
married my high school mama,

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:03.351
raised three kids,
even paid my taxes.

01:32:05.086 --> 01:32:09.189
But you lose that J-O-B, shit.

01:32:10.157 --> 01:32:12.391
I've been arrested 19 times.

01:32:12.393 --> 01:32:15.793
- Ten for jaywalkin'.
- Twenty six for me.

01:32:15.795 --> 01:32:17.296
Thirty two.

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:20.031
Well, give or take.

01:32:20.033 --> 01:32:23.802
Hey, you know who been to jail
more times than any man I know?

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:25.304
Caesar.

01:32:25.306 --> 01:32:28.072
Fifty five times.

01:32:28.074 --> 01:32:31.510
One time, they arrested him
for singin' in the street.

01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:32.712
Wow.

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:38.685
Hail, Caesar.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.174
What do you want?

01:33:35.176 --> 01:33:37.944
Just checking in.
Seeing what's up.

01:33:39.548 --> 01:33:41.315
Sure, whatever.

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:45.851
You know...

01:33:45.853 --> 01:33:50.290
I was your age
when I hit rock bottom,

01:33:50.292 --> 01:33:53.392
when I realized that my anger

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:56.529
and getting loaded
weren't workin' for me anymore.

01:33:56.531 --> 01:33:59.433
- So you know what I did?
- Started selling crack?

01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:03.871
I started reading...

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:05.838
in this room

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.408
in that same chair
you're sitting in now.

01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:10.512
And look where you ended up.

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:14.982
Whoop-de-doo.
Must be like deja vu, huh?

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:21.889
Mike...

01:34:24.292 --> 01:34:26.961
of all the men in this room...

01:34:28.296 --> 01:34:32.434
I look at you and I say
he's the lucky one.

01:34:33.934 --> 01:34:35.567
You know why?

01:34:35.569 --> 01:34:37.037
'Cause there are people
out there

01:34:37.039 --> 01:34:39.639
who are concerned about you.
Your family.

01:34:39.641 --> 01:34:42.909
Your family needs to know
that you're...

01:34:42.911 --> 01:34:44.910
Mike, stop!

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:00.927
- Stuart, you alright?
- Get off of me!

01:35:00.929 --> 01:35:02.629
- Calm down!
- Get off of me!

01:35:09.338 --> 01:35:10.971
Calm down!

01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:21.516
Let go!

01:35:23.385 --> 01:35:25.352
- It hurts!
- Don't resist, Michael.

01:35:25.354 --> 01:35:28.521
- Bring your ass on.
- Just stop. Just stop.

01:35:28.523 --> 01:35:30.423
- Don't resist, okay?
- Come on, bring...

01:35:30.425 --> 01:35:32.225
- Come on.
- Michael, stop!

01:35:32.227 --> 01:35:33.528
Come on, turn.

01:35:39.301 --> 01:35:42.001
You lied to me about my son.

01:35:42.003 --> 01:35:43.403
At least now you know
where he is.

01:35:43.405 --> 01:35:44.571
Why did you lie to me?

01:35:44.573 --> 01:35:45.638
Could I have a minute here,
please?

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.274
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:35:48.276 --> 01:35:49.542
Why did you lie to me?

01:35:49.544 --> 01:35:51.311
A librarian's duty is to protect

01:35:51.313 --> 01:35:53.480
the privacy of the patrons.

01:35:53.482 --> 01:35:55.014
Maybe you've heard
of the Connecticut Four.

01:35:55.016 --> 01:35:57.417
Yes. I've heard
of the Connecticut Four.

01:35:57.419 --> 01:35:59.219
I read that appellate case
when I went back

01:35:59.221 --> 01:36:00.620
to graduate school
ten years ago.

01:36:00.622 --> 01:36:04.560
Goodson,
your intellectual vanity is...

01:36:06.995 --> 01:36:08.397
breathtaking.

01:36:11.667 --> 01:36:13.366
These people
that you're protecting,

01:36:13.368 --> 01:36:16.169
your patrons, is it worth it?

01:36:16.171 --> 01:36:19.040
Is it worth throwing
your life away for?

01:36:20.475 --> 01:36:23.576
Would they do the same for you?
Not on your life, pal.

01:36:23.578 --> 01:36:26.379
I've been working
with drunks and addicts

01:36:26.381 --> 01:36:29.082
and the mentally ill
for my entire career,

01:36:29.084 --> 01:36:31.317
all day, every day.

01:36:31.319 --> 01:36:32.720
And they're not your friends.

01:36:32.722 --> 01:36:35.588
They don't give two shits
about you!

01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:37.457
All they care about
is their next hit,

01:36:37.459 --> 01:36:39.493
their next bottle,
their next meal,

01:36:39.495 --> 01:36:42.061
and they will beg,
borrow and steal

01:36:42.063 --> 01:36:44.632
to get that from you.

01:36:44.634 --> 01:36:48.168
But you already know that,
don't you?

01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:50.673
How many years did you spend
on the street, Goodson?

01:36:54.142 --> 01:36:57.010
Yeah. I read that file.

01:36:57.012 --> 01:37:01.481
"A danger to himself
and others."

01:37:01.483 --> 01:37:04.752
Seventy two hour
psychiatric hold twice,

01:37:04.754 --> 01:37:07.155
51/50'd twice.

01:37:11.092 --> 01:37:12.961
I wanted a second opinion.

01:37:15.498 --> 01:37:17.733
How's this gonna end,
Goodson?

01:37:33.148 --> 01:37:34.382
No.

01:37:36.251 --> 01:37:38.519
Sir, no! This area's closed.
What are you doing?

01:37:38.521 --> 01:37:40.119
Sir, this area's closed.

01:37:40.121 --> 01:37:42.222
- I have to get through.
- You need to move your car.

01:37:42.224 --> 01:37:44.692
- I have to get through.
- No, no, this area's closed.

01:37:44.694 --> 01:37:46.426
You need to move your car
right now.

01:37:46.428 --> 01:37:48.662
I have supplies,
I have clothing,

01:37:48.664 --> 01:37:51.532
I have food
for the folks inside.

01:37:51.534 --> 01:37:53.701
Things they need
to help keep them warm.

01:37:53.703 --> 01:37:56.504
Wait, you're Pastor Bradley,
right?

01:37:56.506 --> 01:37:58.104
You're, you're running
for mayor.

01:37:58.106 --> 01:37:59.272
That's right.

01:37:59.274 --> 01:38:02.411
Now are you gonna help me
put these boxes on the curb?

01:38:04.112 --> 01:38:05.748
Here. Let's start here.

01:38:07.083 --> 01:38:08.816
Yeah. There we go.

01:38:12.421 --> 01:38:14.622
Listen, there's a lot of folks
coming from the church

01:38:14.624 --> 01:38:17.558
with supplies.
You have to let them through.

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:19.560
Hey, what the hell's
going on here?

01:38:19.562 --> 01:38:21.829
This is a secured area.

01:38:21.831 --> 01:38:24.164
Well, you're gonna have
to tell all of them that.

01:38:24.166 --> 01:38:27.368
Excuse me. Is this where
I can drop stuff off

01:38:27.370 --> 01:38:29.537
for all those people in there?

01:38:29.539 --> 01:38:31.372
Yeah, you can...
you can set it here.

01:38:31.374 --> 01:38:32.708
Cool.

01:38:41.818 --> 01:38:44.720
- Do you need some help?
- Sure, thanks.

01:38:56.332 --> 01:38:58.867
Thanks.

01:38:58.869 --> 01:39:01.302
- This is clothes stuffs?
- And some blankets.

01:39:01.304 --> 01:39:03.270
Oh, that's so nice of you.

01:39:03.272 --> 01:39:06.373
You can put food over there
by those, um, red baskets,

01:39:06.375 --> 01:39:07.441
and we'll take this here.

01:39:07.443 --> 01:39:09.476
Okay.

01:39:09.478 --> 01:39:10.679
Don't worry.
I work at the library.

01:39:10.681 --> 01:39:13.180
This is gonna be
the easiest way.

01:39:13.182 --> 01:39:14.815
And you, can you help me
with the cars,

01:39:14.817 --> 01:39:16.585
because I don't know how...

01:39:16.587 --> 01:39:19.488
Oh, cool. This is food stuff,
so...

01:39:28.431 --> 01:39:29.833
Here. Thank you.

01:39:41.812 --> 01:39:44.313
They're not comin' out of there
unless we make 'em.

01:39:45.415 --> 01:39:47.682
I know.

01:39:47.684 --> 01:39:50.152
No matter
how this thing goes down...

01:39:51.588 --> 01:39:54.190
we're gonna look like
the bad guys.

01:39:55.391 --> 01:39:56.793
I know.

01:40:11.842 --> 01:40:14.576
Man, I always knew
you was one of us.

01:40:19.215 --> 01:40:21.585
Why you ain't never tell me
you was on the street?

01:40:22.653 --> 01:40:25.354
- Would it have mattered?
- Hm.

01:40:27.557 --> 01:40:29.623
Reckon there's gonna be
100 angry cops

01:40:29.625 --> 01:40:31.528
at the door soon, huh?

01:40:35.598 --> 01:40:38.767
You know,
there's a lot of vets in here.

01:40:38.769 --> 01:40:41.903
I can't imagine
they care either way.

01:40:41.905 --> 01:40:45.174
You're all a bunch of bums,
Jackson. Don't you know that?

01:40:47.410 --> 01:40:50.180
- They gonna get in.
- They always do.

01:40:53.684 --> 01:40:56.219
This time, I'mma fight back.

01:40:58.789 --> 01:41:01.191
It's a fight you'll lose.

01:41:05.394 --> 01:41:08.430
Yes, that's right,
we are still here live

01:41:08.432 --> 01:41:11.331
in front of the Downtown
Cincinnati Public Library

01:41:11.333 --> 01:41:14.903
where the action had been
unfolding on the inside

01:41:14.905 --> 01:41:18.273
but is now unfolding
on the outside.

01:41:18.275 --> 01:41:19.641
Hey.

01:41:19.643 --> 01:41:20.842
Got it.

01:41:24.949 --> 01:41:27.716
What we've been seeing
is ordinary citizens

01:41:27.718 --> 01:41:31.020
turning up
on an incredibly chilly evening.

01:41:31.022 --> 01:41:33.755
What had been a... a staging area
for local law enforcement...

01:41:33.757 --> 01:41:36.758
Hi, this is Stuart.
Please leave a message.

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:40.028
So you're really pushing
the envelope, huh?

01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:41.964
You seem hell-bent
on getting these guys to use

01:41:41.966 --> 01:41:44.532
whatever means necessary
to get you out of there.

01:41:47.337 --> 01:41:49.940
I thought that you were smarter
than this, Stuart.

01:41:54.444 --> 01:41:57.013
Do you have any idea
how this is gonna end?

01:41:59.717 --> 01:42:01.850
Do you have any idea?

01:42:06.490 --> 01:42:10.327
Well, it looks like
these guys... do.

01:42:52.369 --> 01:42:54.003
George?

01:42:54.005 --> 01:42:55.438
George?

01:42:58.876 --> 01:43:00.844
You wear these now.

01:43:03.047 --> 01:43:05.114
George, you wear these now

01:43:05.116 --> 01:43:06.581
and you'll be able
to look at people

01:43:06.583 --> 01:43:09.020
and not hurt them
with your laser eyes.

01:43:14.992 --> 01:43:17.762
- For real?
- For real.

01:43:26.737 --> 01:43:28.506
Oh.

01:43:36.746 --> 01:43:37.982
See?

01:43:39.684 --> 01:43:41.752
Nobody is exploding.

01:43:45.523 --> 01:43:46.958
You're right.

01:43:48.758 --> 01:43:50.160
Now listen.

01:43:50.162 --> 01:43:52.763
I'm gonna need your help
doing something.

01:43:54.464 --> 01:43:56.000
Uh, detective?

01:44:02.773 --> 01:44:04.374
Shit.

01:44:06.509 --> 01:44:07.743
Ah.

01:44:07.745 --> 01:44:10.579
Jesus Christ. Come on.

01:44:29.566 --> 01:44:31.802
Okay, time to go.

01:44:37.742 --> 01:44:40.075
What? I'm a prosecutor,
not a policeman.

01:44:40.077 --> 01:44:42.446
I mean,
this is... this is your gang.

01:44:52.123 --> 01:44:55.626
