DON'T TELL ME HOW
TO RAISE MY DAUGHTER.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.282
DON'T TELL ME HOW
TO PICK MY SQUAD.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.385
WAY TO GO, KEVIN.

FEELINGS.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.254
YOU HURT THEIR
FEELINGS.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.588
DANNY...

12:35.655 --> 12:37.791
WE BOTH KNOW THOSE
KIDS CAN'T CUT IT.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.794
SHOULD I LIE TO THEM?
BUILD UP THEIR HOPES?

12:40.861 --> 12:43.430
TRUST ME,
IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.965
YOU'LL THANK ME TOMORROW.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.036
I KNEW YOU'D SEE IT
MY WAY.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.447
HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.592
GOD BLESS FAMILY,

13:19.799 --> 13:22.469
MR. LORENZO,
THE SCHOOL JANITOR.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.271
HIS EARS ARE SO HAIRY.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.139
HE'S AN UNFORTUNATE
MAN, PRISCILLA.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.943
AND GOD BLESS DADDY'S
FAVORITE SPORT, FOOTBALL.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.411
AMEN, BABY.
AMEN.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.980
DIG IN.

13:33.046 --> 13:36.416
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DIDN'T PICK BECKY.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.951
YES, YOU DO, KAREN.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.486
NOT GOOD ENOUGH, KEVIN.

13:39.552 --> 13:43.623
SHE'S YOUR NIECE AND ONE OF
THE BEST PLAYERS OUT THERE.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.959
AND SHE CAN
MAKE BOYS CRY.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.427
HONEY, SHE'S A GIRL.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.929
GIRLS CAN RUN COUNTRIES,

13:48.996 --> 13:51.764
THEY CAN SIT
ON THE SUPREME COURT,

13:51.831 --> 13:53.666
THEY CAN DISCOVER RADIUM,

13:53.733 --> 13:55.302
BUT THEY CAN'T PLAY
PEE-WEE FOOTBALL.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.769
CORRECT.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.238
OH, KEVIN.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.740
O.K., MAYBE I WENT
A LITTLE TOO FAR,

14:00.807 --> 14:02.242
WAS A LITTLE...

14:02.309 --> 14:03.643
PIGHEADED?

14:03.710 --> 14:04.878
ALL RIGHT.
CHAUVINISTIC,
MAYBE.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.379
YOU'VE PROVED
YOUR POINT.

14:06.446 --> 14:09.116
AND I THINK BECKY
SHOULD BE INVOLVED
WITH THE TEAM.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.019
OR ANY GIRL WHO
WANTS TO BE.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.254

I NEED POM-POMS.
I NEED CHEERLEADERS!

14:16.823 --> 14:17.991
YES!

14:22.462 --> 14:24.331
I HATE NOT BEING PICKED.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.335
HEY, I GOT AN IDEA.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.838
WHY DON'T
WE PUT MUD TIRES
ON THE GO-CART?

14:31.905 --> 14:33.306
I DON'T WANT TO.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.841
FORGET THE TIRES.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.844
HOW ABOUT IF
WE GO CAMPING
IN THE WOODS,

14:37.911 --> 14:39.312
MAKE MOOSE SOUNDS?

14:39.379 --> 14:40.547
NAH.

14:40.613 --> 14:41.414
AH, FORGET
THE MOOSE SOUNDS.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.150
LISTEN, BECK,

14:43.216 --> 14:44.985
REMEMBER WHEN MOM SAID

14:45.052 --> 14:47.154
THAT SHE WAS GOING
TO HAVE TO DO

14:47.220 --> 14:49.289
WHAT WAS BEST FOR HER?

14:49.356 --> 14:51.158
WHEN SHE CHOSE
TO LEAVE US,

14:51.224 --> 14:54.127
SHE WAS KIND OF MAKING
A CHOICE FOR US, TOO.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.628
I MEAN, IN A WAY,

14:55.695 --> 14:58.966
IT GAVE US A CHANCE
TO GET REAL CLOSE.

14:59.032 --> 15:02.169
WHEN UNCLE KEVIN DIDN'T
PICK YOU FOR THE TEAM,

15:02.235 --> 15:03.703
IT WAS THE SAME THING.

15:03.770 --> 15:07.040
HE FREED YOU UP
TO BE PICKED FOR
SOMETHING ELSE

15:07.107 --> 15:08.908
OR TO DO SOMETHING
TOTALLY DIFFERENT

15:08.976 --> 15:10.910
WHERE YOU COULD
DO THE PICKING.

15:10.978 --> 15:14.381
DAD, I JUST WANT
TO PLAY FOOTBALL.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.018
HEY, SWEETIE, IF I HAD
A FOOTBALL TEAM,

15:18.085 --> 15:19.419
I'D PICK YOU.

15:30.530 --> 15:34.267
WE NEVER GET PICKED
FOR ANYTHING.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.768
LIFE STINKS.

15:35.835 --> 15:38.271
YEAH, THERE GOES MY SHOT
AT THE PROS.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.573
NOW I'LL HAVE
TO BE A SENATOR.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.908
HERE'S A KISS
FOR MURPHY

15:41.975 --> 15:43.977

18:15.094 --> 18:16.363
WHEN HE GETS MARRIED,

18:16.429 --> 18:18.265
WHEN HE SCORES
THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN,

58:08.385 --> 58:10.220
I WASN'T
ALWAYS THE SMARTEST,

58:10.287 --> 58:14.058

LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
THE NEW HEAD COACH.

01:39:59.461 --> 01:40:02.097
IF YOU'RE STILL PISSED
AT ME, DON'T BE.

01:40:02.164 --> 01:40:05.100
IF I WASN'T TOUGH ON
YOU WHEN WE WERE KIDS,

01:40:05.167 --> 01:40:07.902
YOU NEVER WOULD'VE BEEN
ABLE TO BEAT ME TODAY.

01:40:07.969 --> 01:40:09.904
O.K. LISTEN, MY GUYS
ARE WONDERING--

01:40:09.971 --> 01:40:11.973
IF THEY CAN TAR
AND FEATHER ME?

01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:15.943
NO. THEY WONDERING IF
YOUR TEAM WANTS TO JOIN UP
WITH THE LITTLE GIANTS.

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:17.679
ONE TOWN, ONE TEAM?

01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:20.715
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TELL MY BOYS.

01:40:20.782 --> 01:40:24.219
IS THERE SUCH THING
AS HAVING TWO HEAD COACHES?

01:40:24.286 --> 01:40:25.553
NO.

01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:28.956
IN CASE THE HEAD COACH
DOESN'T KNOW AS MUCH
ABOUT FOOTBALL

01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:31.126
AS THE OTHER COACH?

01:40:34.162 --> 01:40:36.598
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT,
ALL RIGHT?

01:40:36.664 --> 01:40:38.466
DEAL.

01:40:38.533 --> 01:40:40.202
DANNY.
THAT STUPID BET WE MADE,

01:40:40.268 --> 01:40:43.438
YOU'RE NOT HOLDING ME
TO IT, ARE YOU?

01:40:43.505 --> 01:40:44.539
KEVIN,

01:40:44.606 --> 01:40:48.810
WOULD I THROW MY OWN
BROTHER OUT ON THE STREET?

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:49.944
NO.

01:40:50.011 --> 01:40:52.314
THERE'S ALWAYS
GONNA BE A JOB FOR YOU

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.815
AT DANNY O'SHEA'S CHEVROLET.

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:55.317
I'LL START YOU
ON COMMISSION--

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:57.085
COME ON! DANNY, LOOK,

01:40:57.152 --> 01:40:59.887
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMEWAY
WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.

01:40:59.954 --> 01:41:01.323
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:41:01.389 --> 01:41:02.857
WELL, THERE IS ONE THING.

01:41:02.924 --> 01:41:04.092
WHAT?
