00:14.520 --> 00:16.640
Hey, you got a permit
for those guns?

00:17.840 --> 00:19.610
I got your permit right here.

00:30.980 --> 00:32.159
Catchy tune.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.160
Fuck this game.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.040
FUCK YOU!

01:20.060 --> 01:22.380
We need backup,
we need Kung Fury!

01:38.140 --> 01:40.260
Yeah, that's my bicep.

01:41.860 --> 01:42.900
One second babe.

01:44.100 --> 01:44.860
Hello?

01:44.900 --> 01:46.940
<i>We got an arcade machine
down here going crazy,</i>

01:47.000 --> 01:49.140
<i>it is killing everybody,
it's destruction, chaos, terror-</i>

01:51.120 --> 01:52.080
What are you gonna do?

01:52.380 --> 01:53.240
My job.

03:00.580 --> 03:01.580
Game over.

03:08.420 --> 03:11.280
<i>I'm a cop and
damn good at my job.</i>

03:12.120 --> 03:14.000
<i>It all began years ago.</i>

03:14.280 --> 03:15.590
<i>In the line of duty,</i>

03:15.690 --> 03:17.160
<i>me and my partner were
chasing down</i>

03:17.170 --> 03:19.160
<i>a mysterious Kung Fu-master.</i>

03:20.540 --> 03:22.000
You're under arrest, punk.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.160
Show us your hands.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.580
Good work, Dragon.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.680
You could've killed both of us
with that crazy stunt

03:28.820 --> 03:31.680
but goddammit, you're the
best partner I've ever had.

03:31.740 --> 03:33.960
Thanks,
I learned from the best.

03:35.140 --> 03:36.660
You're like a father to me.

03:37.180 --> 03:39.910
<i>With one fatal blow,
he hit my partner.</i>

03:42.080 --> 03:44.120
<i>I could tell
he was dead straight off.</i>

03:50.360 --> 03:52.140
<i>Before I could pull the trigger...</i>

03:53.520 --> 03:56.420
<i>I was hit by lightning
and bitten by a cobra.</i>

03:56.930 --> 03:58.080
<i>I blacked out.</i>

04:01.670 --> 04:04.870
<i>And saw images of ancient
Shaolin temples and monks,</i>

04:04.970 --> 04:06.840
<i>mastering the art of Kung Fu.</i>

04:07.270 --> 04:08.710
<i>There was an ancient prophecy,</i>

04:08.810 --> 04:11.210
<i>about a new form
of Kung Fu so powerful,</i>

04:11.310 --> 04:13.120
<i>only one man could master it.</i>

04:13.480 --> 04:14.720
<i>The chosen one.</i>

04:16.440 --> 04:17.500
<i>When I woke up,</i>

04:17.760 --> 04:20.260
<i>I saw the Kung Fu master
running towards me.</i>

04:20.839 --> 04:22.820
<i>I could feel my body mutate</i>

04:22.900 --> 04:25.760
<i>into some sort of
Kung Fu freak of nature.</i>

04:37.020 --> 04:37.740
You!

04:39.310 --> 04:40.710
You are the chosen one!

04:42.580 --> 04:44.780
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

04:45.680 --> 04:47.420
Knuckles.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.180
<i>As a memento,</i>

05:09.260 --> 05:12.500
<i>I put on a strip of cloth
from the dead Kung Fu master.</i>

05:12.770 --> 05:15.480
<i>I decided I would use
my new super Kung Fu powers</i>

05:15.490 --> 05:16.580
to fight crime.

05:16.660 --> 05:18.740
<i>So, I became
the best cop in the world.</i>

05:18.750 --> 05:21.040
<i>I became, Kung Fury.</i>

06:13.000 --> 06:14.840
<i>I don't wanna hear it Kung Fury.</i>

06:14.940 --> 06:18.540
<i>I just got back from city hall,
$50 million worth of damages,</i>

06:18.640 --> 06:21.940
<i>and I got the mayor up
my ass like a fag on Viagra.</i>

06:22.040 --> 06:24.840
How am I going to explain
this to the press, hmm?

06:25.880 --> 06:29.240
You just destroyed an entire
city block for Christ's sake.

06:29.460 --> 06:31.160
Didn't you tell me
to block it out?

06:31.360 --> 06:33.090
I told you do it by the book.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.260
Cut the bullshit.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.890
Nobody else could have stopped

06:35.990 --> 06:37.960
that arcade machine
and you know it.

06:39.990 --> 06:43.060
<i>Oh man, listen to me Kung Fury.</i>

06:43.160 --> 06:46.670
You need to start following
the rules like the rest of us,

06:46.770 --> 06:48.770
so I'm assigning you
a new partner.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.800
What?
Hell no, I work alone.

06:50.820 --> 06:52.470
Not anymore you don't.

06:52.570 --> 06:56.020
Say hi to your new partner,
Triceracop.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.250
Very nice meeting you Kung Fury,

06:58.280 --> 07:00.480
looking forward to
working with you.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.820
You're like a father to me.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.800
I work alone.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.420
Either you team up
with Triceracop,

07:09.480 --> 07:11.240
or you're off the case.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.540
I'm not off the case,

07:13.060 --> 07:14.100
I quit.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.120
Yeah Yeah, I did the blood test.

07:28.220 --> 07:30.140
It was positive, yeah?

07:30.240 --> 07:31.250
<i>What the hell
are you talking about?</i>

07:31.280 --> 07:32.500
Yeah no problem.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.280
<i>Give me the phone.</i>

07:40.720 --> 07:42.800
What the hell is this?

07:44.900 --> 07:48.060
- Chief McNickles speaking.
- Is this the police?

07:48.620 --> 07:51.060
- <i>Yeah, this is the police.</i>
- Fuck you!

08:07.010 --> 08:08.680
<i>MALFUNCTIONING?</i>

08:09.760 --> 08:11.700
I need someone
to trace that call!

08:12.260 --> 08:13.640
But that's impossible!

08:14.240 --> 08:15.540
Not for me it isn't.

08:22.400 --> 08:26.070
<i>Hackerman, he's the most
powerful hacker of all time.</i>

08:29.540 --> 08:30.440
Follow me.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.260
I was able to triangulate
the cell phone signal

08:36.320 --> 08:37.419
and trace the caller.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.520
His name is Adolf Hitler.

08:41.220 --> 08:44.520
Hitler, he's the worst
criminal of all time.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.720
Do you know him, sir?

08:46.120 --> 08:47.320
I guess you could say that.

08:47.720 --> 08:51.440
In the 1940's,
Hitler was a Kung Fu champion.

08:51.690 --> 08:53.260
<i>He was so good at Kung Fu,</i>

08:53.340 --> 08:56.920
that he decided to change
his name to Kung Fuhrer.

08:57.860 --> 08:59.360
But he didn't stop there.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.640
<i>He knew of
the Kung Fury prophecy,</i>

09:01.700 --> 09:03.440
<i>and wanted to claim the throne.</i>

09:03.500 --> 09:05.740
<i>So he and his posse of
Nazi soldiers</i>

09:05.800 --> 09:07.740
<i>conducted experiments
for years.</i>

09:18.920 --> 09:20.600
<i>But they weren't able
to figure out</i>

09:20.620 --> 09:23.160
<i>how to master the art
of Kung Fury.</i>

09:23.940 --> 09:24.900
<i>And one day,</i>

09:24.980 --> 09:27.000
<i>he disappeared
from the face of the earth.</i>

09:27.780 --> 09:29.740
<i>And no-one has seen him
ever since.</i>

09:30.040 --> 09:31.300
Until now.

09:31.760 --> 09:34.720
I guess he figured if he could
find the chosen one and kill him,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.140
he would become
Kung Fury himself.

09:37.180 --> 09:39.320
He must have traveled in time
in order to get here,

09:39.520 --> 09:41.960
that's probably why he
disappeared in the first place.

09:42.300 --> 09:43.820
So, what're you gonna do?

09:44.280 --> 09:45.120
My job.

09:45.660 --> 09:47.980
I'm gonna go back in time
to Nazi Germany,

09:48.160 --> 09:49.760
and kill Hitler,
once and for all.

09:50.020 --> 09:52.000
<i>So, how are you gonna do that?</i>

09:52.160 --> 09:53.400
I'm not sure.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.060
I need some sort of
time machine.

09:59.900 --> 10:00.880
Wait a minute,

10:01.120 --> 10:03.740
using an RX modulator,
I might be able to conduct

10:03.750 --> 10:06.630
a mainframe cell direct and
hack the uplink to the download.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.560
What does that mean?

10:07.580 --> 10:11.270
It means that with the right computer
algorithms, I can hack you back in time.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.200
Just like a time machine.

10:14.020 --> 10:16.540
Well then, it's hacking time.

11:32.900 --> 11:33.860
Oh, no!

12:34.900 --> 12:35.960
<i>Fuck!</i>

12:36.940 --> 12:38.340
<i>That's a Laser-Raptor.</i>

12:38.460 --> 12:40.720
<i>I thought they went extinct
thousands of years ago.</i>

13:05.260 --> 13:06.480
Who are you?

13:06.720 --> 13:07.600
My name,

13:09.240 --> 13:10.640
is Barbarianna.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.240
What year is this?

13:18.640 --> 13:20.000
It's the Viking age.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.860
<i>That explains the Laser-Raptor.
Fuck!</i>

13:23.060 --> 13:24.700
<i>I went too far back in time.</i>

13:25.220 --> 13:26.920
You need to get out
of this valley.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.640
This place is swarming
with Laser-Raptors.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.760
I'll meet you at the God's drop.
Katana can help you get there.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.100
Who's Katana?

13:34.740 --> 13:35.920
<i>I'm Katana.</i>

13:39.660 --> 13:41.420
I can give you a ride to Asgard.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.080
A ride on what?

14:05.820 --> 14:07.460
So, who are you?

14:08.200 --> 14:10.440
I'm a cop from the future.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.340
I was sent back in time
to kill Hitler,

14:13.400 --> 14:17.000
but I accidentally went
too far back in time

14:17.840 --> 14:19.120
and ended up in this place.

14:21.860 --> 14:24.720
I know someone
who might be able to help you.

14:28.440 --> 14:32.960
Thor!

14:47.620 --> 14:50.380
Behold! It is me, Thor!

14:50.540 --> 14:53.520
Son of Odin
and protector of mankind.

14:53.580 --> 14:55.420
Check out my pecs.

14:55.580 --> 14:56.860
Your pecs are epic.

14:57.020 --> 14:58.160
<i>Thanks bro!</i>

15:02.960 --> 15:05.200
So, anyway.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.060
Thor, this is Kung Fury,
he's a cop from the future.

15:09.100 --> 15:12.640
Yeah, I need to get to
Nazi Germany and kill Hitler...

15:12.660 --> 15:15.040
- so if you could help me with--
- Stop!

15:16.860 --> 15:18.240
Hammer time.

15:22.400 --> 15:26.820
Walk through this portal and
you shall end up in Nazi Germany.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.600
Good luck to you, Kung Fury!

15:29.640 --> 15:30.800
Thanks Thor!

15:37.460 --> 15:39.860
Well,
looks like this is my ride.

15:40.360 --> 15:44.080
Hey, future cop,
where are you going?

15:48.320 --> 15:51.320
You know what.
Here, take my number.

15:52.260 --> 15:54.120
And use this phone to call me.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.760
It's a personal, transportable,
cellular telephone.

15:57.940 --> 16:00.980
<i>It features 645 channel
capacity,</i>

16:01.220 --> 16:05.460
<i>10 number speed dial,
and an electronic security lock.</i>

16:05.600 --> 16:09.000
<i>This revolution in communication
could make it possible</i>

16:09.060 --> 16:11.960
for more and more people
to have a phone in their car!

17:30.520 --> 17:31.940
Tank you.

17:40.440 --> 17:45.040
I am the greatest Kung Fu master
of all time,

17:45.280 --> 17:46.460
right guys?

17:55.240 --> 17:56.380
<i>Thank you!</i>

18:09.620 --> 18:10.980
I'm disarming you.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.660
My arm! My arm!

18:27.100 --> 18:28.680
Kill him!

20:00.640 --> 20:02.120
You don't need that spine,

20:04.400 --> 20:06.080
it's holding your back!

20:35.900 --> 20:36.700
<i>A-ha!</i>

20:37.000 --> 20:38.340
Fuck you Kung Fury.

20:38.620 --> 20:41.820
Now nothing can stop me
and my army of death.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.880
Thank you guys!

21:03.360 --> 21:04.240
What the fuck?

21:48.220 --> 21:49.520
Kill them!

22:44.880 --> 22:49.480
Alright Hitler, the gig is up,
show me your hands.

23:08.060 --> 23:11.060
Hackerman,
have you seen Kung Fury?

23:13.140 --> 23:16.060
Oh, no! We were too late.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.400
Who the hell are you?

23:54.760 --> 23:57.720
My name is Cobra.

23:58.060 --> 24:01.620
I've been expecting you,
Kung Fury.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.720
I'm your spirit animal.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.720
What the hell is this place?

24:06.100 --> 24:11.080
This is heaven,
I'm afraid you're dead.

24:11.300 --> 24:11.880
What?

24:12.740 --> 24:14.260
But it looks so real.

24:15.240 --> 24:19.180
Yeah, no, it's totally real.

24:19.580 --> 24:21.740
Mr. Cobra, I'm a police officer

24:21.750 --> 24:24.700
and I need you to send me
back to earth, pronto.

24:25.080 --> 24:27.520
I'm sorry,
I can't help you with that.

24:27.580 --> 24:30.200
You see, you're dead.

24:30.340 --> 24:32.260
- You're under arrest!
- What?

24:32.680 --> 24:37.640
For obstruction of justice,
you're breaking the law!

24:50.920 --> 24:52.140
What the hell happened?

24:52.720 --> 24:55.280
I hacked away all of
your bullet wounds Kung Fury.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.160
Thanks!

25:17.960 --> 25:21.800
I want to welcome you
and your friends to Germany.

25:24.540 --> 25:26.800
We are not so different,
you and I.

25:27.320 --> 25:30.720
I mean we both got
good style, you know?

25:30.820 --> 25:32.580
With Red, you know?

25:33.140 --> 25:34.180
So, that's cool!

25:36.780 --> 25:40.880
We both like doing moves, yah!
Check it out, yah!

25:41.260 --> 25:42.240
<i>Yah!</i>

25:42.240 --> 25:46.480
Good, killing people, I love it,
you clearly do, too!

25:47.320 --> 25:49.000
<i>And that's cool!</i>

25:49.820 --> 25:50.820
Join me,

25:51.440 --> 25:54.740
we could be brothers,
we are so alike.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.700
It's almost like
we finish each other's...

25:57.720 --> 25:59.080
- Balls.
- What?

26:21.800 --> 26:24.260
Oh, my,
not much left of him is there?

26:24.270 --> 26:25.880
The important thing is that
he is gone.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.600
Sorry I doubted you Triceracop.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.400
You're the best damn partner
I've ever had.

26:31.680 --> 26:34.780
I came back in time
for you Kung Fury,

26:34.920 --> 26:37.140
because, damn it,
I love you.

26:40.980 --> 26:44.020
Team work is very important.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.880
So, what happens now, Kung Fury?

26:51.760 --> 26:53.960
Well, I need to
head back to the office.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.360
Looks like it's gonna be
hell of a lot of paperwork.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.140
Open the doors, Hoff.

27:22.380 --> 27:25.360
I'm sorry Fury,
I can't let you do that.

27:25.440 --> 27:26.720
Open the doors, Hoff!

27:27.060 --> 27:30.580
I'm sorry, I can't let you
open the doors Kung Fury.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.080
Goddammit, open the doors!

27:32.220 --> 27:34.980
- I'm sorry I can't--
- Open the doors!

27:36.020 --> 27:41.000
Did anyone ever tell you
not to hassle the Hoff 9000?

27:41.600 --> 27:44.780
Oh, Hoff 9000,
you son of a bitch.

27:58.980 --> 28:00.300
Piece of shit.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.520
Oh, my,
not much left of him is there?

28:19.690 --> 28:21.880
The important thing is that
he is gone.

28:34.540 --> 28:35.860
Game over.

28:37.660 --> 28:38.640
Wait a minute,

28:40.600 --> 28:42.780
I've seen that symbol before...

28:44.920 --> 28:46.760
somewhere.

28:55.640 --> 28:56.800
Hitler!
