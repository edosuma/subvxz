<i>Previously on Boston Legal…</i>

00:01.940 --> 00:03.175
I was a drug addict and

00:03.175 --> 00:05.202
I needed my father and you abandoned me.

00:05.202 --> 00:06.385
Who is this?

00:06.386 --> 00:07.366
Your granddaughter.

00:07.366 --> 00:09.460
Please welcome Mr and Mrs Denny Crane.

00:09.460 --> 00:09.938
Denny!

00:09.973 --> 00:13.002
Bev has hired an army
of lawyers to gut this firm.

00:13.003 --> 00:16.202
An agreement has been reached
in the matter of Crane vs Crane.

00:16.202 --> 00:18.767
I will buy a house for Bev in Hawaii.

00:18.802 --> 00:20.316
You'll be the one that
got away from Denny Crane.

00:20.316 --> 00:22.199
Look me up if you're ever on the big island.

00:22.199 --> 00:23.240
I am the big island.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.140
Denny, they're doing some sort
of renovations at my hotel.

00:26.140 --> 00:29.005
I was wondering if I could spend
the night at your place.

00:29.005 --> 00:30.840
Stay as long as you need.

<i>…believe that 24% of married couples,</i>

00:43.799 --> 00:45.553
<i>which to me is a very large number,</i>

00:45.553 --> 00:47.346
<i>do not sleep in the same bed.</i>

00:47.346 --> 00:48.624
<i>Yeah… yeah… listen to me. Yeah!</i>

00:48.624 --> 00:49.486
Denny, you're ready to go?

00:49.486 --> 00:50.968
<i>And they say it has nothing to do…</i>

00:50.968 --> 00:53.559
<i>And they're happy about it with not
being compatible with a person.</i>

00:53.559 --> 00:54.324
<i>You want to get a good night's rest…</i>

00:54.324 --> 00:56.115
Denny, you must go to work.

00:56.116 --> 00:57.942
It's hump day, your favorite day.

00:57.942 --> 01:00.749
I don't have a favorite anything anymore.

01:00.784 --> 01:05.220
Listen, I understand the need to retreat
into oneself after a failed love affair,

01:05.220 --> 01:08.013
but you haven't gone to work
in three days.

01:08.048 --> 01:10.413
You've been in that bed for two.

01:10.448 --> 01:11.860
You're drinking…

01:11.895 --> 01:13.885
scotch at 9:00 in the morning.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.470
And most disturbingly,
you're watching “The View”.

01:16.470 --> 01:18.230
Leave me alone.

01:20.575 --> 01:23.383
Hey! hey! hey!
Same team. Same team!

01:23.418 --> 01:25.988
Consider this an intervention.

01:26.023 --> 01:30.377
It's no use, Alan.
Nothing interests me anymore.

01:30.596 --> 01:34.179
<i>Construction worker Russell Blayney…
arrested for attempted murder</i>

01:34.179 --> 01:37.407
<i>for setting a booby trap in his home
to catch burglars.</i>

01:37.407 --> 01:40.565
<i>Miguel Dominguez allegedly
broke into Blayney's house</i>

01:40.565 --> 01:45.242
<i>and received a reported 50,000 volts

<i>Russell Blayney…
victim or vigilante?</i>

01:52.446 --> 01:53.158
<i>In other news today…</i>

01:53.158 --> 01:54.349
That case…

01:55.045 --> 01:58.985
I want that case.

01:59.020 --> 02:02.995
I see your bliss is back as well.

02:06.887 --> 02:09.198
Your honor, the commonwealth
moves that bail be denied.

02:09.198 --> 02:12.579
Mr Blayney is charged with attempted
murder and is an obvious flight risk.

02:12.579 --> 02:13.779
If I may, my client…

02:13.803 --> 02:15.291
Your honor…

02:15.517 --> 02:17.354
I need a moment with my client.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.448
You don't have a client here, Mr Crane.

02:19.448 --> 02:21.216
Count to ten, judge.

02:21.251 --> 02:23.408
Mr Blayney, do you know who I am?

02:23.443 --> 02:26.409
Yeah, you're Denny Crane.
I've seen you on “Larry King”.

02:26.409 --> 02:27.277
You're famous.

02:27.312 --> 02:29.465
So who would you rather
have as your attorney…

02:29.465 --> 02:33.601
me or, uh, hacky
McGuilty Verdict here?

02:33.636 --> 02:35.719
I've faced him before,
you'd rather have him.

02:35.719 --> 02:39.799
Don't feel bad, son. Takes a big man
to recognize a bigger man.

02:39.834 --> 02:42.201
We're waiting, Mr Crane.

02:42.236 --> 02:45.973
Uh, I move for a continuance,
your honor.

02:46.383 --> 02:49.277
I just got the case.

03:23.405 --> 03:26.920
Shirley, first thing in the morning,
haven't even had my coffee.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.728
Normally I'd make a witty retort
about caffeine and

03:29.728 --> 03:31.553
your aging reproductive system,

03:31.553 --> 03:35.112
but not today, Alan. I have a problem.

03:35.487 --> 03:38.396
Karl Hauser died this week.

03:38.609 --> 03:39.967
The photographer.

03:40.002 --> 03:44.317
I knew him years ago. We hadn't been
in touch for some time,

03:44.352 --> 03:47.864
but… well, he's dead.

03:47.899 --> 03:49.718
I'm sorry.

03:51.465 --> 03:54.462
I met Karl when I was
a sophomore at Wellesley.

03:54.497 --> 03:58.622
I spent the summer in Manhattan,
and we met in the West Village.

03:58.657 --> 04:02.078
He was this amazing, fascinating man,

04:02.113 --> 04:06.070
and he told me I was very pretty.

04:06.105 --> 04:10.028
And… I did some modeling for him.

04:10.775 --> 04:13.378
Please tell me this is going
where I think it's going.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.508
Yeah, it is.

04:14.509 --> 04:18.896
Karl took some very tasteful
black and white nudes of me.

04:18.930 --> 04:22.005
I am so disappointed in you,
Shirley. “Tasteful”?

04:22.041 --> 04:23.806
There's going to be an estate auction.

04:23.806 --> 04:27.688
And I want you to find a way to block
the sale of those photographs.

04:27.688 --> 04:29.482
How many pictures are we talking about?

04:29.482 --> 04:33.777
I think there were 15, maybe 20…

04:33.812 --> 04:34.654
That's not so many.

04:34.654 --> 04:37.095
rolls of film that he used.

04:37.130 --> 04:41.211
I am so glad I came into work today.

04:41.246 --> 04:43.561
Down, boy, this is serious.

04:43.596 --> 04:48.018
Karl promised me that he wouldn't show
the photographs to anyone.

04:48.053 --> 04:51.113
However, I signed a standard release
saying that

04:51.148 --> 04:54.917
he could show them to… everyone.

04:54.952 --> 04:56.931
Why are you so worried
about this, Shirley?

04:56.931 --> 05:00.038
You were young.
Young people do all sorts of things.

05:00.038 --> 05:03.766
And now you wear clothes
to the office every single day.

05:03.801 --> 05:07.494
Shocking as it may seem to you,
Alan, I like my privacy.

05:07.529 --> 05:10.254
Maybe I'll want to be
a federal judge someday.

05:10.254 --> 05:14.870
And being a named partner
at a prestigious law firm…

05:14.905 --> 05:18.239
Well, it's not good for business.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.247
I'll give you my best effort.

05:21.282 --> 05:23.574
Of course, at some point,

05:23.609 --> 05:28.251
I will have to examine the evidence thoroughly.

05:50.701 --> 05:52.545
Oh! Here they are.

05:52.580 --> 05:53.521
Oh, sorry we're late.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.068
No problem.

05:55.069 --> 05:57.272
Fiona, say hello to grandpa.

05:57.307 --> 05:58.744
Hi, paw paw.

05:58.745 --> 06:01.466
Hi. Hello, sweetheart.

06:01.501 --> 06:03.221
I guess you're paw paw from now on.

06:03.221 --> 06:06.301
Well, that's one of the nicest names I've ever been called.

06:06.301 --> 06:07.431
We were almost out the door.

06:07.431 --> 06:09.183
She insisted on wearing the red cowboy boots.

06:09.183 --> 06:11.266
I finally said okay.  And of course,
then we could only find one,

06:11.266 --> 06:13.387
and we finally found the other one
on top of the refrigerator.

06:13.387 --> 06:13.925
Oh!

06:13.960 --> 06:16.257
And you get to where it's pointless to ask
how it got on top of the refrigerator.

06:16.257 --> 06:17.393
You just grab it and go.

06:17.393 --> 06:20.830
I, uh, I took the liberty of ordering
coffee and some hot chocolate.

06:20.830 --> 06:22.710
Oh, thanks so much.

06:23.958 --> 06:25.158
We can just stay a second.

06:25.158 --> 06:27.829
It's Fiona first day at Happy Duck Day Care.

06:27.864 --> 06:29.846
Ah! Is that a good place?

06:29.881 --> 06:32.070
But don't let the cheesy name fool you. They're great.

06:32.070 --> 06:33.615
I went to so many places.

06:33.650 --> 06:38.365
I had a checklist I used.. ah, yeah, here it is.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.021
Ah, well, let's see what we have here.

06:42.056 --> 06:43.522
“Childcare Question”.

06:43.557 --> 06:45.396
“Are They Licensed and Monitored?”

06:45.396 --> 06:49.177
“Do They Afford Opportunities for Both
Active and Quiet Play?”

06:49.212 --> 06:51.672
“Is the Staff Trained in C.P.R.?”

06:51.707 --> 06:54.579
“Do the Kids Appear Happy?”

06:54.614 --> 06:56.980
Rachel, this is a very thorough list.

06:57.015 --> 06:58.951
Well, she's my daughter.

06:59.568 --> 07:01.403
Where are my keys?

07:01.438 --> 07:03.709
It's in your pocket.

07:03.744 --> 07:05.946
Yap, here they are.

07:05.981 --> 07:09.417
Dad, in all the cowboy boot madness this morning.

07:09.452 --> 07:11.903
I lost my ATM card somewhere.

07:11.938 --> 07:14.023
You think you could loan me 40 bucks?

07:14.023 --> 07:15.895
No problem.

07:16.632 --> 07:18.833
You know, um, Rachel,

07:18.868 --> 07:21.127
if you're in a hurry to get to work,

07:21.162 --> 07:25.665
I can drop Fiona off at, uh… Happy Duck, is it?

07:25.700 --> 07:28.522
Oh, thanks. We'll make it okay.

07:28.557 --> 07:32.036
Fiona, we have to go. Thank paw paw for your hot chocolate.

07:32.036 --> 07:34.030
Thanks, paw paw, for my chocolate.

07:34.030 --> 07:35.252
You're very welcome.

07:35.287 --> 07:35.989
Thanks, dad.

07:35.989 --> 07:36.813
Bye, darling.

07:36.848 --> 07:37.621
See ya.

07:37.622 --> 07:39.520
Bye bye.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.956
Bye bye, Fiona.

07:42.559 --> 07:45.026
Bye bye.

08:00.823 --> 08:03.160
By your look, it's not good.

08:03.195 --> 08:05.866
I believe Rachel's using again.

08:05.901 --> 08:08.005
She's back on crystal meth.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.075
What proof do you have?

08:10.110 --> 08:13.783
We were supposed to meet at 8:00… coffee
shop near her apartment.

08:13.783 --> 08:16.744
She showed up 20 minutes late with Fiona in tow.

08:16.779 --> 08:20.058
Was harried, disorganized. She couldn't find her keys.

08:20.093 --> 08:25.225
Paul, you have just described every
single working mother in America.

08:25.260 --> 08:28.935
Then she asked to borrow $40.

08:29.517 --> 08:35.970
Crystal meth users live their lives in
$40… increments, cash.

08:37.066 --> 08:39.631
Paul, this is a very serious accusation,

08:39.666 --> 08:43.298
and you need to be absolutely certain before you make it.

08:43.332 --> 08:45.002
I know.

08:45.421 --> 08:47.394
If I'm right, and I do nothing,

08:47.429 --> 08:49.744
Fiona could be in danger.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.060
If I act and I'm wrong,

08:52.095 --> 08:55.298
Rachel will never speak to me again.
She'll cut me out forever.

08:55.298 --> 08:57.246
What do I do?

08:57.281 --> 08:59.149
You've lived through a lot with Rachel,

08:59.149 --> 09:03.049
and this relationship you're developing
with her now is very new.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.855
You might want to ask yourself if your history

09:05.890 --> 09:10.825
with Rachel's drug use is causing you to overreact.

09:10.860 --> 09:13.799
Just think about it.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.414
You, Blondie, you're on my team.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.919
If you've seen the news, you know what a travesty this is.

09:36.919 --> 09:39.698
A man arrested for defending his own home.

09:39.733 --> 09:43.726
it's a farce, and not the funny kind.
This is one serious farce.

09:43.761 --> 09:45.977
May I ask what we're pleading? It seems self-defense…

09:45.977 --> 09:48.158
Don't like that kind of thinking. That's defensive thought.

09:48.158 --> 09:49.937
We've got to strike first. Preempt them.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.388
What'd they say in the news… “Victim or vigilante”?

09:52.388 --> 09:55.028
It's neither. This is Russell Blayney… hero.

09:55.051 --> 09:56.855
You want to try this case in the press?

09:56.855 --> 09:57.678
Exactly.

09:57.679 --> 10:00.709
I want to grab the public's attention.

10:00.744 --> 10:03.763
With a story, a character, a narrative,

10:03.798 --> 10:06.782
we have to create our own reality.

10:08.373 --> 10:11.060
You, young punk, you must know computers.

10:11.095 --> 10:13.748
Set up a web site, one of those blobs…

10:13.783 --> 10:15.592
“Justice for Russell Blayney”.

10:15.627 --> 10:17.920
And you, Denise, you'll be my second.

10:17.955 --> 10:20.835
You look good on camera.

10:27.053 --> 10:29.210
Karl Hauser's widow is here.

10:30.996 --> 10:35.059
Straightforward, standard release Karl
used for all his models.

10:35.858 --> 10:39.157
A lifetime of papers and contracts, and
you manage to find mine.

10:39.157 --> 10:40.547
God bless the organized.

10:40.547 --> 10:43.877
And there's no mistaking your signature.

10:50.222 --> 10:53.994
I'm so sorry. It's just, here you are.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.255
I may cry.

10:56.290 --> 10:58.088
He loves art.

10:58.123 --> 11:02.350
Marguerite, I'm sorry, but your husband was an adult.

11:02.385 --> 11:04.096
A famous man of the world.

11:04.131 --> 11:08.912
And I was an immature kid who did not
understand the document she was signing.

11:08.947 --> 11:11.433
There was no meeting of the minds here.

11:11.468 --> 11:15.290
So this contract, I'm afraid, is not binding.

11:15.325 --> 11:19.352
As I recall, it wasn't your minds that met.

11:23.356 --> 11:25.482
If you were old enough to screw my husband,

11:25.482 --> 11:27.776
you were old enough to understand what you were signing.

11:27.776 --> 11:31.815
Your husband talked me into doing quite
a few things I didn't understand.

11:31.815 --> 11:34.861
Tell me, why should I do something nice for you?

11:34.896 --> 11:37.493
And don't say because you did something
nice for my husband.

11:37.493 --> 11:41.093
What do you intend to do… with the photos?

11:41.128 --> 11:43.934
Half of Karl's collection is already promised to

11:43.934 --> 11:46.112
the museum of modern art in New York.

11:46.112 --> 11:48.255
I intend to auction off the other half.

11:48.255 --> 11:50.267
Including those photos.

11:50.302 --> 11:53.515
Your pictures will be going on the block.

12:01.022 --> 12:05.095
I need a favor… a very important, very personal favor.

12:05.130 --> 12:06.257
Of course.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.009
After an extended absence,

12:08.044 --> 12:12.888
I have recently reconnected with my daughter Rachel,

12:12.923 --> 12:17.372
and I've learned that I have a beautiful
granddaughter named Fiona.

12:17.407 --> 12:19.195
Congratulations, Paul.

12:19.928 --> 12:23.047
My daughter is a drug addict.

12:23.082 --> 12:25.289
Or at least, she was. She says she's clean now,

12:25.289 --> 12:27.763
but I have my suspicions.

12:27.798 --> 12:32.454
If she is using again, then my
granddaughter could be in danger.

12:32.489 --> 12:34.870
My specialty isn't family law. But what I know…

12:34.870 --> 12:39.932
No, no, you misunderstand. I don't want your legal advice.

12:39.967 --> 12:44.995
I want you to find out if my daughter is using drugs again.

12:45.737 --> 12:49.546
Brad… if this year has taught me anything,

12:49.581 --> 12:55.512
it's that you will get the job done by any means necessary.

12:57.307 --> 13:03.496
I would never ask this of you unless it was essential.

13:08.026 --> 13:12.970
Absolutely. I'll do what I can.

13:23.516 --> 13:25.088
What have you got?

13:25.123 --> 13:26.661
The 26th amendment.

13:27.855 --> 13:31.448
Karl Hauser was taking naked pictures of
me, not denying me the vote.

13:31.448 --> 13:34.634
The 26th amendment, which not only
extended the right to vote to 18 year olds,

13:34.634 --> 13:41.218
but also persuaded the states to grant them
status as adults, was ratified in 1971.

13:41.253 --> 13:47.376
The photos were taken in 1966. Which,
by the way, is my new favorite year.

13:47.411 --> 13:50.331
And now mine as well.

13:50.366 --> 13:52.817
I wasn't 21 when I signed that agreement.

13:52.817 --> 13:57.553
I was legally a minor, and therefore
can repudiate the contract.

13:57.588 --> 14:00.383
And I am an idiot.
Why didn't I think of this sooner?

14:00.383 --> 14:02.606
I'm going to credit karma or Freud.

14:02.641 --> 14:07.952
Either way, it's because I was destined
to discover and revel

14:07.987 --> 14:13.508
in the natural wonders of all that is you.

14:27.654 --> 14:29.274
Uh, excuse me.

14:29.309 --> 14:32.687
I'm looking for some books on addiction and recovery.

14:32.722 --> 14:35.465
Uh, yeah, they're in the self-help
section right over there.

14:35.465 --> 14:42.559
Thanks.

14:42.594 --> 14:43.766
Is there, you know, one book that's better than the others?

14:43.766 --> 14:45.075
This way.

14:48.434 --> 14:51.231
This one has some good advice on the early stages,

14:51.231 --> 14:54.388
when you're detoxing and… and all that wonderful stuff.

14:54.388 --> 14:58.677
And, uh, this one is really good for
that time right after you've stopped.

14:58.677 --> 15:02.757
When you're trying to figure out how to
put your life back together.

15:03.623 --> 15:05.799
Well, you know a lot about this.

15:05.834 --> 15:09.084
Well, clean five years, three months and seven days.

15:09.119 --> 15:12.335
It's hard, but when you're ready, you can get there.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.496
Thanks.

15:13.531 --> 15:14.623
Sure.

15:15.891 --> 15:19.148
Uh, what time do you get off work?

15:19.183 --> 15:21.285
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not coming on to you.

15:21.285 --> 15:23.427
I was just hoping that we could talk some more.

15:23.427 --> 15:26.992
I've sort of run out of people to talk to.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.330
I get off at 7:00.

15:28.365 --> 15:29.737
Thanks.

15:29.738 --> 15:31.347
Sure, I'm Rachel.

15:31.382 --> 15:33.318
I'm Brad. Nice to meet you.

15:35.995 --> 15:37.047
You're buying those, right?

15:37.047 --> 15:39.286
Oh, right, right.

15:47.953 --> 15:50.944
I, uh, I hang sheetrock, mostly for industrial buildings.

15:50.944 --> 15:54.184
A craftsman. He works with his hands. Write that down.

15:55.308 --> 15:56.206
What else?

15:56.241 --> 15:58.731
Oh, well, I live alone. Jamaica Plain.

15:58.732 --> 16:00.174
My ex-wife left me the house.

16:00.174 --> 16:02.512
It's not a bad neighborhood. But it does border one,

16:02.512 --> 16:06.299
and it's vulnerable because I have those
old fashioned lever windows.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.879
I can't afford an alarm system.

16:07.879 --> 16:11.179
I've been broken into four times in the last two years.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.778
Drug addicts, they take everything.

16:12.778 --> 16:16.399
They took my TV, my bike,
my power tools, my guitar.

16:16.434 --> 16:19.076
Musician. He writes the songs.

16:19.589 --> 16:23.260
Uh, but, uh, what finally did it for me was when

16:23.295 --> 16:25.252
I was building an end table for my father

16:25.252 --> 16:27.174
for his television remote, his nebulizer

16:27.174 --> 16:29.904
'cause he has, uh, some asthma.

16:29.939 --> 16:32.371
And I'm halfway done, and some guy breaks into the house

16:32.371 --> 16:34.212
and he.. and he steals my table saw.

16:34.212 --> 16:35.595
My table saw!

16:35.630 --> 16:38.376
I mean, that was it. That's… that was all I could take.

16:38.376 --> 16:40.547
I'm not into guns.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.683
Don't write that down.

16:42.718 --> 16:45.693
But I, uh, I knew that I… I had to do something.

16:45.728 --> 16:47.981
So that's when I rigged up my little system.

16:47.981 --> 16:50.717
You know, just a little jolt, you know,
send them a little shock.

16:50.717 --> 16:53.167
Tell us what happened that night. You were at home?

16:53.167 --> 16:54.608
Yeah, I was awake, actually.

16:54.608 --> 16:57.185
Um, I was putting some dishes away in the dishwasher.

16:57.185 --> 16:59.072
And I heard some noise on the porch.

16:59.072 --> 17:00.889
And I thought, here we go, this is it.

17:00.889 --> 17:02.183
So I moved into the living room.

17:02.183 --> 17:03.312
So you saw him?

17:03.313 --> 17:04.691
Yeah, he was looking right through the window.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.034
He's a big wetback, you know?

17:06.034 --> 17:06.856
Latino.

17:06.857 --> 17:08.954
Drug addict, I, He was completely high.

17:08.954 --> 17:12.628
I could see it in his eyes even from inside the house.

17:12.642 --> 17:13.721
And then what happened?

17:13.721 --> 17:16.047
Well, he… he starts for the window.

17:16.048 --> 17:18.291
Now I don't know if you've ever seen anyone on crystal meth

17:18.291 --> 17:20.590
or acid or, I don't know, whatever this guy was on.

17:20.590 --> 17:23.363
But, you know, they're big and they're ugly.

17:23.397 --> 17:25.470
And they feel like they're invincible.

17:25.470 --> 17:27.965
So, he… he starts trying to pry open the window

17:27.965 --> 17:31.015
with a screwdriver or something.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.064
and, uh… you know, that was it.

17:36.082 --> 17:39.243
The electricity went up the screwdriver into his body.

17:39.243 --> 17:41.407
He… he completed the circuit.

17:41.442 --> 17:42.342
Sound horrible.

17:42.377 --> 17:44.163
Honestly, you know, it wasn't.

17:44.163 --> 17:45.284
I mean, watching this guy.

17:45.284 --> 17:48.296
It was, it was like watching every guy
who broke into my house

17:48.296 --> 17:51.590
over the years and took from me, stole my stuff.

17:51.625 --> 17:54.745
I mean, he was just getting what he deserved, right?

17:54.761 --> 17:56.954
Let me tell you the most unbelievable thing.

17:56.954 --> 17:58.953
Did you know that when you get electrocuted,

17:58.953 --> 18:00.713
you know, your blood literally boils?

18:00.713 --> 18:02.019
Right inside the veins.

18:02.019 --> 18:04.169
That's how the electricity flows through your body,

18:04.169 --> 18:05.404
through you veins!

18:05.439 --> 18:08.075
And so here's this guy. He's a wetback.

18:08.110 --> 18:11.953
But I could see his veins are glowing through his skin

18:11.988 --> 18:14.655
as he was being charred from the inside out.

18:14.690 --> 18:17.649
And I… I could smell his flesh burning.

18:17.684 --> 18:20.608
Which was weird. It smelled like a… a roast.

18:20.643 --> 18:23.914
A well deserved, cooked roast.

18:23.949 --> 18:27.207
That's when I, you know…
finally turned off the electricity,

18:27.207 --> 18:30.076
when he was good and done.

18:42.369 --> 18:44.255
Well, so much for putting our hero on the stand.

18:44.255 --> 18:46.349
Oh, he's on the stand, all right.

18:46.384 --> 18:48.376
Denny, with all due respect,

18:48.411 --> 18:50.569
the man was practically wearing a bib with a knife

18:50.569 --> 18:52.692
and a fork in each hand as he was telling that story.

18:52.692 --> 18:54.390
Denise, never give up an option.

18:54.390 --> 18:58.572
The man was alit with passion, the kind
of passion that moves juries.

18:58.607 --> 18:59.222
So?

18:59.257 --> 19:02.490
So he tell the story, not necessarily all his story,

19:02.491 --> 19:04.132
but the part we want to tell.

19:04.132 --> 19:07.552
We're the ones creating the narrative.

19:22.308 --> 19:23.975
Are you kidding?

19:24.010 --> 19:26.231
Were you kidding about wanting to get straight?

19:26.231 --> 19:27.690
No.

19:33.429 --> 19:36.748
Thank you, Patrick, and keep coming back, buddy.

19:36.783 --> 19:40.068
Um, are there any other new members here today?

19:42.491 --> 19:45.348
Brad… would you like to share?

19:45.383 --> 19:47.801
Uh, no. I'm new.

19:47.836 --> 19:50.335
It'll make you feel better.

19:51.224 --> 19:54.601
Right, uh…

19:55.451 --> 19:57.359
Hi, uh…

19:57.394 --> 19:59.657
Say your name.

20:00.906 --> 20:02.370
I'm Brad. I'm a drug addict.

20:02.370 --> 20:04.717
Hi, Brad.

20:04.752 --> 20:06.941
Um, I'm not used to talking in public.

20:06.941 --> 20:12.773
Well, actually, I am, just not talking about myself.

20:15.017 --> 20:19.523
Wow. you're just going to let me keep going. Okay.

20:19.558 --> 20:24.522
I was in the marine corps during the
first Gulf War, operation Desert Storm.

20:24.557 --> 20:29.487
February 24, 1991. I was a Lieutenant in
second reconnaissance battalion

20:29.522 --> 20:31.551
of the first marine expeditionary force.

20:31.551 --> 20:35.165
Under enemy mortar, artillery and small arms fire,

20:35.200 --> 20:39.615
we breached minefields, trenches, barbed
wire and disabled six enemy divisions.

20:39.615 --> 20:41.021
By the morning of the 28th,

20:41.021 --> 20:43.565
from a hundred hours after the ground operations had begun,

20:43.565 --> 20:46.692
our coalition forces had destroyed 42 enemy divisions.

20:46.692 --> 20:51.307
That's the bulk of the Iraqi army in the
Kuwaiti theater of operations.

20:56.180 --> 20:59.893
So then I started using drugs.

21:13.244 --> 21:15.316
Denny, you're shiny…

21:15.351 --> 21:16.787
and in a wedge.

21:16.822 --> 21:18.223
My team, Alan.

21:18.224 --> 21:21.172
I'm back and I'm feeling it.

21:21.207 --> 21:22.908
I've realized a truth about myself.

21:22.908 --> 21:27.201
I just love… power.

21:27.236 --> 21:29.398
Well, it seems to have a thing
for you as well.

21:29.398 --> 21:31.707
It's m natural state.
It's my homeostasis.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.641
Don't read anything into that remark.

21:33.641 --> 21:35.454
I already did.

21:40.527 --> 21:45.696
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

21:45.731 --> 21:50.693
the courage to change the things I can
and the wisdom to know the difference.

21:50.728 --> 21:53.931
It works if you work it. So work it!

21:53.966 --> 21:55.931
See you soon.

22:09.673 --> 22:11.771
That was a nice story.

22:11.806 --> 22:13.968
Uh… thanks.

22:14.242 --> 22:17.087
Too bad it was a lie.

22:17.122 --> 22:19.480
I won the war, then started using?

22:19.515 --> 22:22.246
I've been coming to these meetings
every day for five years.

22:22.246 --> 22:26.184
If you didn't want to share your problems,
you should've just passed.

22:26.184 --> 22:28.781
Oh, sharing's not really my thing.

22:28.816 --> 22:31.344
It's probably just how I was raised.

22:31.379 --> 22:34.482
Doesn't mean you can't change.
I was raised the same way.

22:34.482 --> 22:35.065
Really?

22:35.100 --> 22:36.216
Yeah, my mother was warm,

22:36.216 --> 22:41.799
but my father kept every emotion
tightly tucked away in his suit pocket.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.387
Right next to his watch.

22:43.422 --> 22:44.820
It's not always that easy to open up.

22:44.820 --> 22:48.572
Ah, but it is. You just say
what's on your mind.

22:48.607 --> 22:50.881
Instead, my dad…
always the attorney.

22:50.916 --> 22:53.155
He'd just sit back and play little games.

22:53.155 --> 22:56.755
You know, letting out information
with his obtuse questions.

22:56.780 --> 23:00.071
And on the rare occasion when
he would open up and talk to me,

23:00.071 --> 23:03.327
he wasn't happy unless I told him
what he wanted to hear.

23:03.327 --> 23:05.579
You know, being him…

23:05.614 --> 23:08.247
I think it's a hard way to live.

23:08.282 --> 23:10.532
I'm sorry.

23:11.732 --> 23:14.513
And I'm sorry.

23:15.018 --> 23:18.217
Well, buy me a cup of coffee
and I might forgive you.

23:18.252 --> 23:20.296
Great.

23:27.797 --> 23:31.502
And therefore, at age 19,
Ms Schmidt was, in fact, a minor.

23:31.537 --> 23:33.595
There was no parental consent here,

23:33.595 --> 23:39.803
So, in essence, your husband was
illegally taking nude photographs
of an underage girl.

23:40.326 --> 23:42.058
You make a legitimate argument, Mr Shore.

23:42.058 --> 23:46.159
Not my favorite kind, but I'm glad
to play for that team when necessary.

23:46.159 --> 23:49.038
And you could certainly take us to court
and fight this battle with that argument.

23:49.038 --> 23:50.312
We will if we have to.

23:50.312 --> 23:53.974
However, I believe your goal was to get
these photos out of the public eye.

23:53.974 --> 23:56.946
I'm afraid with a court battle,
a very public court battle,

23:56.946 --> 23:58.794
these photos could find
their way to the press.

23:58.794 --> 24:02.584
Before that could happen, of course,
we'd ask the court to seal all exhibits

24:02.584 --> 24:05.237
and issue an appropriate gag order
to prevent disclosure.

24:05.237 --> 24:06.768
And you'd win, but you know what?

24:06.768 --> 24:09.153
Thanks to the internet,
winning doesn't matter anymore.

24:09.153 --> 24:11.968
These photos could somehow
find their way onto the web,

24:11.968 --> 24:15.268
then all around the world,
and then where would you be?

24:17.203 --> 24:19.180
Marguerite.

24:26.128 --> 24:27.744
Marguerite.

24:31.073 --> 24:33.465
Oh, I'll be right out.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.206
Alan.

24:47.068 --> 24:48.859
I'm sorry.

24:50.161 --> 24:52.095
Thank you.

24:52.130 --> 24:54.029
Marguerite…

24:56.240 --> 24:58.892
Those pictures…

24:58.927 --> 25:05.414
I have grandchildren.  The thought
of them seeing those photographs…

25:05.449 --> 25:08.328
I understand.

25:10.644 --> 25:13.521
I'm sorry.

25:23.071 --> 25:25.555
Your honor, Mr Dominguez's
prior burglary convictions

25:25.555 --> 25:28.005
and history of drug abuse
have no bearing on whether

25:28.005 --> 25:30.181
the defendant improperly
electrified his home.

25:30.181 --> 25:33.674
Nonsense.  This felon was higher
than a kite when he got zapped.

25:33.674 --> 25:36.235
He has six prior convictions
for larceny, burglary

25:36.235 --> 25:38.726
and grand theft auto.
Of course it's relevant.

25:38.726 --> 25:40.726
The prejudicial effect of the victim's
prior criminal activity—

25:40.726 --> 25:42.969
Your honor, my client
is a victim here. I don't under—

25:42.969 --> 25:43.959
—clearly outweighs—

25:43.959 --> 25:46.523
any probative value such evidence
would have for the jury.

25:46.523 --> 25:47.107
Enough.

25:47.108 --> 25:48.565
Mr Ginsberg is right.

25:48.600 --> 25:53.041
The evidence is highly prejudicial
and will be barred at trial.

25:53.076 --> 25:57.482
Mr Crane, you may not bring up
Mr Dominguez's prior bad acts

25:57.517 --> 26:01.080
unless the door to impeachment
has been opened.

26:03.991 --> 26:06.205
Before answering any questions,

26:06.240 --> 26:11.050
I want to thank my client Miguel Dominguez
for bravely agreeing to be here today.

26:11.050 --> 26:14.506
Mr Dominguez suffers from severe paralysis

26:14.541 --> 26:18.804
and a host of other debilitating symptoms
as the result of his electrocution.

26:18.804 --> 26:22.772
Nevertheless, he is here today
to stand up for all of us,

26:22.807 --> 26:26.706
to help in the fight to make
our country a safer place,

26:26.741 --> 26:31.534
a place where citizens do not take
the law into their own hands.

26:31.569 --> 26:35.540
Mr Dominguez is an inspiration
to his community.

26:35.575 --> 26:38.321
He is a hero.

26:38.775 --> 26:40.306
Thank you.

26:41.551 --> 26:43.949
That bastard stole my story.

26:53.244 --> 26:54.531
What about branding?

26:54.566 --> 26:55.818
I haven't branded yet.

26:55.818 --> 26:56.654
No branding?

26:56.689 --> 26:57.491
No, no, not.

26:57.492 --> 26:58.930
Denny.

26:58.965 --> 26:59.495
Denny.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.333
Oh, uh, Denise Bauer.

27:01.334 --> 27:03.599
Candy Springtime, public relations.

27:03.634 --> 27:04.221
Hello.

27:04.256 --> 27:04.773
Hi.

27:04.808 --> 27:06.616
She's with, uh, Sherling Thompson.

27:06.616 --> 27:10.442
The same, uh, public relations firm
the government uses. So you know she's good.

27:10.442 --> 27:14.234
Denise, we're rolling out a new campaign
to take back the story on Mr Blayney.

27:14.234 --> 27:16.123
Ya… “Take back the story”?

27:16.158 --> 27:18.430
Oh, Denny tells me that
you haven't branded him yet.

27:18.430 --> 27:21.154
So I took the initiative
and created a brand.

27:21.189 --> 27:24.436
Russell Blayney,
American Homeowner.

27:24.471 --> 27:25.891
“American Homeowner”?

27:25.926 --> 27:27.218
Simple. It's to the point.

27:27.218 --> 27:28.079
And cozy.

27:28.114 --> 27:30.490
Say it for me, Denny. Press conference voice.

27:30.490 --> 27:32.083
Russell Blayney, American Homeowner.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.954
Now wait a minute, wait a minute.

27:33.954 --> 27:35.644
American Homeowner, Russell Blayney.

27:35.644 --> 27:37.265
See, it works both ways. Versatile.

27:37.265 --> 27:42.252
But do we really think that
we need to label Mr Blayney?

27:42.287 --> 27:43.880
Denny?

27:44.616 --> 27:47.931
Uh, Denise: Rodney King.

27:47.966 --> 27:51.926
Rodney King, uh, severely beaten
by the police over ten years ago.

27:51.934 --> 27:53.914
See, you remember, why? Branding.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.912
They didn't call him Rodney King…

27:55.912 --> 27:57.680
wife beater, alcohol abuser,

27:57.715 --> 28:01.349
who swung a tire iron
at a convenience store clerk.

28:01.384 --> 28:04.541
They called him Rodney King, motorist.
Or motorist Rodney king.

28:04.541 --> 28:09.445
Brings to mind images of a jaunty man
in a riding hat and cap in a model T.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.900
That's what we want.
Russell Blayney, American Homeowner.

28:12.920 --> 28:16.290
Not Russell Blayney eats them
broiled, baked or fried.

28:16.325 --> 28:17.837
But Rodney King was beaten.

28:17.837 --> 28:20.301
Okay, now this is just a mock up.

28:20.336 --> 28:24.587
Obviously, we will replace
Jimmy Stewart with Mr Blayney.

28:24.622 --> 28:27.963
But the banner can
and should be behind you

28:27.998 --> 28:29.997
every press conference, Denny.

28:30.032 --> 28:32.728
Notice I used the same font
as “Mission Accomplished”.

28:32.728 --> 28:34.286
Americans are comfortable
with that font.

28:34.286 --> 28:37.259
Now we will send B-Roll
of Mr Blayney to the press,

28:37.259 --> 28:39.324
working in his garage,
using his table saw,

28:39.324 --> 28:42.157
working with his power tools,
fixing things around the house.

28:42.157 --> 28:45.894
And as far as the talking points,
keep it simple, Denny.

28:45.929 --> 28:49.632
Speak of the opposition
as the drug crazed intruder,

28:49.667 --> 28:51.954
the incident as the
harrowing home invasion.

28:51.954 --> 28:54.172
Now I know you're tight
with Larry King.

28:54.172 --> 29:00.016
But we are negotiating with “Nightline,”
“Hardball” and “The Daily Show”.

29:00.789 --> 29:03.926
That is where most Americans
get their news.

29:07.390 --> 29:08.923
There's no way
we're gonna win this, is there?

29:08.923 --> 29:12.702
Legally, yes, there is, as for
accomplishing your goals, no.

29:12.737 --> 29:15.639
But when you have occasion
to ask for my help, Shirley,

29:15.639 --> 29:18.507
typically, it's not really
legal help you're looking for.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.575
I'll assume this is no exception.

29:20.610 --> 29:24.017
Alan, I've already caused Marguerite
Hauser as much pain as I care to.

29:24.017 --> 29:28.452
I'll leave the creativity to you,
just don't hurt her.

29:29.307 --> 29:34.330
<i>America is under siege, not from
Saddam or pro-terrorists,</i>

29:34.365 --> 29:38.083
<i>but from namby pamby
pro-burglary advocates</i>

29:38.118 --> 29:41.621
<i>who want to strip us of the right
to protect what's ours.</i>

29:41.621 --> 29:43.045
<i>That's what our—</i>

29:43.363 --> 29:45.843
Looks like Denny's being Denny.

29:45.878 --> 29:48.288
He's “creating the reality”.

29:48.323 --> 29:51.982
I doubt many people would want
to live in Denny's reality.

29:52.017 --> 29:55.463
All I know is there are
two rotten guys in this case,

29:55.498 --> 29:58.909
and both sides are trying
to make theirs as the hero.

29:58.944 --> 30:00.337
If you've got a problem
with this case,

30:00.337 --> 30:03.345
I suggest you talk to the guy
whose name is on the door.

30:03.345 --> 30:04.786
I'm not naïve, Paul.

30:04.821 --> 30:07.354
I know this kind of manipulation
goes on all the time.

30:07.354 --> 30:09.798
But I'm an attorney,
not a spin doctor.

30:09.833 --> 30:11.451
Oh, yes, you are.

30:11.989 --> 30:13.490
We all are.

30:13.525 --> 30:15.134
That's what attorneys do…

30:15.169 --> 30:17.074
tell stories, create characters,

30:17.074 --> 30:21.289
capture an audience, try them make them
feel what we want them to feel.

30:21.289 --> 30:23.404
That's good lawyering.

30:23.439 --> 30:25.887
Only these days, everybody's trying
to get in on our act…

30:25.887 --> 30:27.988
The government, the corporations.

30:28.023 --> 30:30.089
There are no facts anymore, kiddo.

30:30.124 --> 30:32.520
Only good or bad fiction.

30:32.555 --> 30:36.475
Which story do you plan
to sell the jury?

30:36.510 --> 30:38.118
Don't you worry.

30:38.153 --> 30:43.144
This case will never go to trial.

30:48.691 --> 30:50.621
Mr Shore, with all due respect.

30:50.656 --> 30:52.286
You are on our last nerve.

30:52.321 --> 30:54.394
You said you had
an intriguing offer.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.320
Get to it.

30:55.355 --> 30:56.247
Delighted.

30:56.248 --> 31:00.207
First, how about we ask all
the lawyers to leave the room?

31:00.242 --> 31:01.933
You're a lawyer.

31:01.968 --> 31:06.516
Okay. How about all
the lawyers who aren't me?

31:11.933 --> 31:13.530
Here it is, then.

31:13.565 --> 31:17.216
Simply put… it's Shirley Schmidt.

31:17.251 --> 31:20.868
As much as I admire and respect her,

31:20.903 --> 31:23.485
if I don't resolve this case,

31:23.520 --> 31:26.810
I'm afraid she'll get nervous
and fall back on old habits.

31:26.810 --> 31:30.354
She'll call in the old guard, one of
the cronies in banking and finance,

31:30.354 --> 31:32.739
someone who smells like
old pipe smoke and hair tonic,

31:32.739 --> 31:37.479
someone with a florid nose from too many
old-fashions at lunch down the street.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.443
And this fella, whoever he is,
will have friends.

31:40.478 --> 31:43.390
Friends who work in banks,
who probably shouldn't,

31:43.390 --> 31:46.562
who don't treat confidential information
very confidentially.

31:46.562 --> 31:47.763
And then, Marguerite,

31:47.763 --> 31:50.369
the old crony will discover
how deeply in debt you are.

31:50.369 --> 31:52.263
And once he learns this,

31:52.298 --> 31:55.397
my replacement will make a few
phone calls, write a few letters,

31:55.397 --> 31:58.427
and seek out your husband's
most distant and forgotten relative.

31:58.427 --> 32:01.814
Perhaps a less fortunate cousin who
always admired but could never afford

32:01.814 --> 32:03.457
one of your husband's beautiful artworks.

32:03.457 --> 32:06.178
And my replacement will reach out
to him and commiserate

32:06.178 --> 32:08.907
and convince him to contest
your husband's will.

32:08.907 --> 32:11.024
At which point, your husband's estate
will be tied up.

32:11.024 --> 32:13.653
Well, it could be for years,
decades, really.

32:13.653 --> 32:16.371
And if this replacement of mine
turns out to be this fella

32:16.371 --> 32:19.246
I'm thinking of, it could get really ugly.

32:20.833 --> 32:25.122
For such a vague man, you've been
extraordinarily clear, Mr Shore.

32:25.157 --> 32:27.021
Yes, and here's the thing.

32:27.056 --> 32:31.299
I just don't like the way these people
operate around here.  It's just not right.

32:31.299 --> 32:34.521
These photographs are yours
to do with what you please,

32:34.521 --> 32:36.131
and you should get a fair market price.

32:36.131 --> 32:42.843
So, before I simply give up
and call it a day…

32:42.878 --> 32:46.731
I'd like to ask you one question.

32:48.391 --> 32:51.272
And what is that?

32:51.307 --> 32:54.154
What is your price?

33:06.329 --> 33:08.090
Have you made contact with Rachel?

33:08.090 --> 33:11.970
I did. I told her I was a drug addict.

33:12.005 --> 33:12.923
And?

33:12.958 --> 33:15.336
She took me to a narcotics
anonymous meeting,

33:15.336 --> 33:19.252
told me that if I wanted to get clean,
that I needed to work the program.

33:19.252 --> 33:21.151
So, she's no longer using?

33:21.186 --> 33:24.250
No. She's been clean for five years.

33:24.285 --> 33:27.666
I mean, she's calm,
rational, straightforward…

33:27.701 --> 33:31.165
very down to earth,
as a matter of fact.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.992
Fine.

33:33.027 --> 33:35.499
Thank you, Brad.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.477
You know, Paul, for what it's worth,

33:38.512 --> 33:41.383
she really wants to have
a relationship with you.

33:41.383 --> 33:42.642
And I with her.

33:42.643 --> 33:46.704
And you know what might help?
Is if you showed her a little faith.

33:46.739 --> 33:48.191
She might pick up on that.

33:48.191 --> 33:49.562
I beg your pardon?

33:49.563 --> 33:53.792
Well, she says that sometimes,
you can be very… judgmental.

33:53.827 --> 33:56.739
Brad while your efforts
are fully appreciated,

33:56.774 --> 33:59.845
your advice to a father
concerning his daughter is not.

33:59.845 --> 34:03.900
You have no idea the years I've spent
dealing with my daughter's illness.

34:03.900 --> 34:08.069
So it would behoove you
to be more circumspect.

34:08.103 --> 34:12.523
I'm sorry. That was over the line.

34:12.558 --> 34:15.485
But, I mean, Paul, the truth is
you've got, really, a hell of a daughter.

34:15.485 --> 34:19.087
She's sweet, she's beautiful,
nothing rattles her.

34:19.121 --> 34:20.842
Even when she lost her ATM card…

34:20.842 --> 34:23.885
I would've panicked.
But she was really cool.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.177
What are you talking about?

34:25.177 --> 34:27.331
Oh, Rachel's lost her ATM card.

34:27.367 --> 34:29.857
So I loaned her 40 bucks.

34:50.973 --> 34:52.281
Dad.

34:52.315 --> 34:55.719
I had a lunch meeting nearby.

34:55.755 --> 34:58.706
Well, how very impromptu
of you, and unusual.

34:58.741 --> 35:03.358
Yes, well… people can change.

35:03.713 --> 35:05.701
Yes, they can.

35:07.036 --> 35:08.919
Come on in.

35:12.575 --> 35:13.957
Can I get you something to drink?

35:13.957 --> 35:16.006
No, no, I…

35:16.014 --> 35:19.996
I thought I would take Fiona to the
aquarium if that's all right with you.

35:19.996 --> 35:22.539
Yeah, I… I pick her up
from day care in 20 minutes.

35:22.539 --> 35:25.560
Good, I'll go with you.

35:25.595 --> 35:27.452
Sure.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.653
May I use your bathroom?

35:33.688 --> 35:35.051
Through there.

36:18.904 --> 36:20.744
You have a child.

36:22.355 --> 36:23.311
A child!

36:23.346 --> 36:24.315
This is my house.

36:24.315 --> 36:24.901
How long?

36:24.902 --> 36:26.261
You came here
and you set me up.

36:26.261 --> 36:27.199
You will not ruin her.

36:27.199 --> 36:28.265
You have ruined everything

36:28.265 --> 36:30.485
and everyone you've ever come
in contact with.

36:30.485 --> 36:31.011
I hate you.

36:31.011 --> 36:33.214
You will not do this
to my granddaughter.

36:33.214 --> 36:34.929
I hate you.

36:34.964 --> 36:36.645
You bastard!

36:43.130 --> 36:45.930
Is counsel prepared to begin <i>voir dire</i> ?

36:45.965 --> 36:47.089
We are, your honor.

36:47.089 --> 36:49.218
The commonwealth may begin.

36:53.220 --> 36:56.910
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm assistant district attorney Ginsberg.

36:56.910 --> 36:59.998
Now as we begin to pick
our potential jury members,

37:00.033 --> 37:01.846
I just want to get to know
a bit about you.

37:01.846 --> 37:04.049
First off, by a show of hands,

37:04.084 --> 37:08.008
how many of you have heard
about this case on the news?

37:08.526 --> 37:09.811
I see.

37:09.846 --> 37:15.286
And how many of you have seen
opposing counsel Denny Crane on the news?

37:18.037 --> 37:21.762
Juror number seven, can you tell us
what opinions you've formed?

37:21.762 --> 37:24.648
I think people should be allowed
to defend their homes.

37:24.648 --> 37:27.500
Like Mr Crane said, if the guy
didn't want to get hurt,

37:27.500 --> 37:29.368
he shouldn't have been robbing anyone.

37:29.368 --> 37:32.012
Commonwealth challenges
juror number seven for cause.

37:32.012 --> 37:33.652
No objection, your honor.

37:33.687 --> 37:37.022
Juror number seven, you are excused.

37:37.057 --> 37:39.636
I've worked hard to become
an American Homeowner.

37:39.636 --> 37:41.198
If the guy tried to break into my place

37:41.198 --> 37:42.273
I'd do the same thing.

37:42.273 --> 37:43.904
I'd want to kill the son of a bitch.

37:43.904 --> 37:45.367
It's my right as
an American Homeowner.

37:45.367 --> 37:49.146
I may live in an apartment, but I still
consider myself an American Homeowner.

37:49.146 --> 37:50.372
American Homeowner.

37:50.407 --> 37:51.613
American Homeowner.

37:51.648 --> 37:53.089
American Homeowner.

37:53.124 --> 37:54.725
American Homeowner.

37:54.760 --> 37:56.292
God bless America.

37:56.327 --> 37:59.285
Your honor, with his television
appearances and theatrics,

37:59.285 --> 38:01.867
Mr Crane has tainted the jury pool
to such an extent

38:01.867 --> 38:04.414
that the commonwealth moves
for a change of venue.

38:04.414 --> 38:06.480
Denied, Mr Ginsberg.

38:06.515 --> 38:09.941
You both have manipulated
the media coverage of this case,

38:09.941 --> 38:13.388
only Mr Crane has done
a better job of it.

38:13.423 --> 38:16.835
You will play in the sandbox
that you built.

38:29.408 --> 38:32.235
Shirley, Blondie, join me.

38:34.154 --> 38:37.234
I'm happy to inform you
there's going to be a plea bargain

38:37.234 --> 38:38.887
in the American Homeowner case.

38:38.887 --> 38:40.810
How do you know?

38:40.845 --> 38:44.581
<i>Today, my office has indicted
city councilman Adam Patrick</i>

38:44.581 --> 38:48.411
<i>on charges of accepting bribes
and illegal campaign contributions.</i>

38:48.411 --> 38:51.337
<i>He has agreed to surrender
at his arraignment.</i>

38:51.337 --> 38:54.528
He's changing the narrative.
We're yesterday's news.

38:54.563 --> 38:56.153
You got to hand it to him.
The guy's good.

38:56.153 --> 38:57.682
He's creating his next reality.

38:57.682 --> 38:59.130
I wonder what he's gonna put
on the table.

38:59.130 --> 39:00.241
No jail time.

39:00.276 --> 39:01.947
How can you be so sure?

39:01.982 --> 39:03.618
Years of experience.

39:03.653 --> 39:06.169
And he called a half an hour ago.

39:13.233 --> 39:15.561
What are you going to do with those?

39:16.675 --> 39:18.310
I haven't decided.

39:18.345 --> 39:21.990
You know the one where you're not
quite sure what you're looking at,

39:21.990 --> 39:25.364
then you take a step back
and realize what it is?

39:26.380 --> 39:28.167
That one may be going
in the powder room.

39:28.167 --> 39:28.838
Alan…

39:28.839 --> 39:32.175
Tell you what… I'll leave them
to you when I die.

39:32.210 --> 39:35.570
As things stand, I'm quite sure
I'll pass on before you.

39:35.583 --> 39:39.214
Show those pictures to anyone,
and I'll see to it myself.

39:39.249 --> 39:42.846
Shirley, I have no intention
of sharing those with anyone.

39:42.881 --> 39:46.672
I'm keeping you all to myself.
I give you my word.

39:47.166 --> 39:52.023
You're one of the few people for whom
I know that to be true.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.154
Thank you.

39:55.189 --> 39:57.614
No, thank you.

40:15.072 --> 40:17.550
I understand congratulations
are in order.

40:17.550 --> 40:20.724
Never lost, never will.

40:22.209 --> 40:24.410
I may not be the Denny Crane
I once was,

40:24.410 --> 40:26.320
but until today, I didn't realize

40:26.320 --> 40:29.420
that this Denny Crane
might be even better.

40:29.455 --> 40:32.973
Opposing lawyers everywhere are quaking
in their custom fitted shoes.

40:32.973 --> 40:37.987
Damn right, they are.
So who cares if she…

40:38.022 --> 40:40.142
Who cares…

40:40.968 --> 40:42.686
You're still upset about Bev.

40:42.686 --> 40:44.306
What I don't understand is,

40:44.334 --> 40:46.711
I was married to one of my wives
for five years,

40:46.711 --> 40:48.031
got over her in a day.

40:48.036 --> 40:51.932
Bev and I were married
for three hours, and yet…

40:51.967 --> 40:54.194
And yet?

40:54.229 --> 40:59.011
Do you know that I even have
memories of her that aren't sexual?

40:59.046 --> 41:01.801
I'm sure you do.

41:01.836 --> 41:03.991
I miss her.

41:04.855 --> 41:06.727
I miss her.

41:08.238 --> 41:10.386
Well, are the rumors true?

41:10.421 --> 41:13.711
You have naked photos of Shirley?

41:13.746 --> 41:16.967
Ah, come on.
What's the big deal?

41:17.002 --> 41:21.406
I've had naked photos
of Shirley for years.

41:27.057 --> 41:30.572
Denny, she's asleep in all these.

41:30.607 --> 41:34.053
Here's one where she woke up.

41:34.088 --> 41:42.033
Have you ever seen a beautiful,
naked woman look that angry?

41:43.305 --> 41:49.188
