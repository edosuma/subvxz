-You got to pick it up!
<i>-Previously on</i>
Tough As Nails...

00:04.204 --> 00:06.072
Got to move this material.
It's drying fast.

00:06.139 --> 00:07.240
ALFIE:
Don't worry about
straightening it.

00:07.307 --> 00:08.875
Bro, it's gonna set.

00:08.942 --> 00:11.244
<i>KEOGHAN:</i>
<i>Savage Crew melted</i>

00:11.311 --> 00:12.445
SARAH:
One person needs to talk.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.047
<i>-...while Dirty Hands...</i>
-It's a check.

00:14.114 --> 00:15.115
-(cheering)
<i>-...sealed the win.</i>

00:15.181 --> 00:17.016
KEOGHAN:
You are also the winners

00:17.083 --> 00:19.185
of $60,000.

00:19.252 --> 00:22.155
-Yes, sir.
-...for the overall
team competition.

00:22.222 --> 00:23.957
It was just unleashed
emotion and joy.

00:24.023 --> 00:25.525
MIKE:
I'm upset.

00:25.592 --> 00:27.861
We're just breaking apart.
It hurts right here.

00:27.927 --> 00:29.763
We need to get it together.

<i>...Elizabeth pulled</i>

00:36.636 --> 00:37.904
Fantastic job.

00:37.971 --> 00:40.740
<i>Forcing Tak</i>

One move left!

00:42.475 --> 00:43.543
LIA:
You're neck and neck!

00:43.610 --> 00:44.878
Quincey gets the win!

<i>Tak punched out.</i>

00:47.113 --> 00:50.450
<i>Tonight,</i>

00:50.517 --> 00:52.352
-How about a battle
of the trades?
-(work whistle blows)

00:52.419 --> 00:54.821
<i>...one last chance for</i>
<i>Savage Crew to earn money.</i>

00:54.888 --> 00:56.289
-It's not over.
-LIA: Go, go, go, go, go.

00:56.356 --> 00:58.191
<i>KEOGHAN:</i>
<i>But Dirty Hands,</i>
<i>already up 5-3...</i>

00:58.258 --> 01:00.326

01:00.393 --> 01:01.561
<i>-with a bang.</i>
-TAK: Yeah, boy.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.363
<i>KEOGHAN:</i>
<i>And the remaining contenders</i>

<i>in the individual competition</i>

01:05.298 --> 01:08.735
<i>try to stack and pack their way</i>

01:08.802 --> 01:10.203
-ELIZABETH: So close.
-KEOGHAN: Got a jammed-up
nail gun.

01:10.270 --> 01:11.371
No, it's not gonna catch.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.173
(groans)
I thought everything was right.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.809
<i>KEOGHAN:</i>
<i>This is</i> Tough As Nails.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.147
KALIMBA: What do you guys
think about today, like,

01:21.214 --> 01:22.949
how are you feeling going
into today's team challenge?

01:23.016 --> 01:24.884
-Feeling good.
-JEROME: Yeah.

01:24.951 --> 01:26.953
Winning everything--
we winning everything.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.289
QUINCEY:
I believe Savage Crew gonna be

01:29.355 --> 01:30.723
setting their differences
aside today.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.325
-Maybe.
-You think so?

01:32.392 --> 01:34.727
I think they may pull together
and try to work hard.

01:34.794 --> 01:35.929
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>The team score today</i>

01:35.995 --> 01:38.431
is Dirty Hands five,
Savage Crew three.

01:38.498 --> 01:41.167
<i>Not to be greedy,</i>
<i>but even though Dirty Hands wn</i>

01:41.234 --> 01:42.936
the overall team challenge,

01:43.002 --> 01:44.704
<i>$12,000 is still up for grabs,</i>

01:44.771 --> 01:46.005
and we gonna go for it.

01:46.072 --> 01:48.074
All we got to do is just
get out there and work.

01:48.141 --> 01:49.342
LIA:
We're gonna win today.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.044
KALIMBA:
Yeah.

01:52.111 --> 01:53.680
ALFIE:
This is the last challenge

01:53.746 --> 01:56.883
that we're gonna share
as Savage Crew.

01:56.950 --> 01:57.917
We need to win,
and we know what it takes

01:57.984 --> 01:59.352
and we know what we got to do.

01:59.419 --> 02:01.154
SARAH:
I noticed,
in the last team challenge,

02:01.221 --> 02:03.957
we're all used to doing
our own thing back home

02:04.023 --> 02:05.825
and, you know,
we're experts in our crafts.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.760
But when it comes
to a team challenge, like,

02:07.827 --> 02:09.162
-we got to get over that.
-KELSY: Right.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.530
-HANGER: You're right.
-SARAH: You know, come together.

02:10.597 --> 02:12.532
Well said.
And we've all come together,

02:12.599 --> 02:15.301
from different parts
of this world,

02:15.368 --> 02:17.704
and with different,
uh, abilities.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.006
<i>Construction worker, a mason,</i>

02:20.073 --> 02:22.475

<i>superintendent, a lineman.</i>

02:25.044 --> 02:27.146
<i>But we came together</i>
<i>as Savage Crew.</i>

02:27.213 --> 02:29.616
You-you guys are amazing,
I just wanted to point that out,

02:29.682 --> 02:31.384
that, you know, like,

02:31.451 --> 02:32.852
I picked you guys

-HANGER: Yeah.
-And I feel like
I'm responsible.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.357
And I want us to win.

02:37.423 --> 02:39.659
-SARAH: We know that
this is ours. We need it.
-HANGER: There we go.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.127
We want it.
That's how we have to operate.

02:41.194 --> 02:42.428
And let's take this win,

02:42.495 --> 02:44.564
and walk away with no regrets,

02:44.631 --> 02:46.032
No regrets.

-Welcome to the Thunderdome.
-Scrapyard.

Good morning.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.915
-CONTESTANTS: Morning, Phil.
-Yep, it's a scrapyard.

<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Coming into today's</i>
<i>team challenge,</i>

<i>you know, we're looking</i>
<i>for redemption.</i>

03:06.219 --> 03:07.320
We need this win.

03:07.387 --> 03:10.290
Welcome to our final
team challenge.

03:10.356 --> 03:14.394
Score stands right now
at five to three.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.896
Dirty Hands took out
the team competition

03:16.963 --> 03:18.665
for the overall win,

03:18.731 --> 03:22.035
and won that $60,000
cash bonus prize.

03:22.101 --> 03:23.303
But I have...

03:24.704 --> 03:27.273
-...$12,000 up for grabs.
-(applause)

03:28.374 --> 03:30.209
I tell you what
we're gonna do today.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.444
How about a battle
of the trades?

03:31.511 --> 03:32.612
What do you think about that?

03:32.679 --> 03:34.080
-Yeah.
-Yes.

03:34.147 --> 03:37.083
(laughs)
This is gonna be awesome.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.685
KEOGHAN:
We're gonna get you guys to go

03:38.751 --> 03:40.353
one at a time, head-to-head,

03:40.420 --> 03:42.188
one challenge at a time.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.857
Up first, here you'll see
a set of scales,

03:44.924 --> 03:47.126
and behind that
is a concrete block.

03:47.193 --> 03:51.130
You are going to smash
your weight in concrete.

03:51.197 --> 03:53.232
You're gonna put it
into that steel cage,

03:53.299 --> 03:56.169
<i>through a tight</i>
<i>five-by-five-inch hole</i>

03:56.235 --> 03:58.705
<i>and tip the scale.</i>

03:58.771 --> 04:00.506
This is about
power-to-weight ratio.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.309
Over here, a skill job.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.345
<i>You will be using a grinder</i>

04:05.411 --> 04:07.914
<i>to cut a slice</i>
<i>of seven-inch pipe,</i>

04:07.981 --> 04:10.149
<i>and put it on the stand.</i>

04:10.216 --> 04:11.517
<i>Sparks will be flying.</i>

04:11.584 --> 04:13.152
And then,
if you look over there,

04:13.219 --> 04:14.887
those two bikes each have

04:14.954 --> 04:16.656
a 50-foot chain
wrapped around them.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.257
<i>You have to undo all that</i>

04:18.324 --> 04:22.829
and throw those bikes onto the
scrap heap as fast as you can.

04:22.895 --> 04:25.031
-Everybody ready to get to work?
-(cheering)

04:25.098 --> 04:26.666
<i>KALIMBA:</i>
<i>What Dirty Hands does</i>

04:26.733 --> 04:29.569
is work together as a team
in stressful situations.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.437
<i>This is something different,</i>

04:31.504 --> 04:33.072
<i>it's gonna be individual,</i>
<i>one-on-one.</i>

04:33.139 --> 04:34.340
I think we're both
evenly matched

04:34.407 --> 04:35.875
in this type of competition.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.144
Dirty Hands, because you won
the last team competition,

04:38.211 --> 04:40.246
you get to pick
your first competitor.

04:40.313 --> 04:41.247
Let's go.

04:41.314 --> 04:42.548
KEOGHAN:
Choose carefully.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.384
Once somebody's been picked,
that person

04:44.450 --> 04:46.953
can't be picked again
until everybody on the team

04:47.020 --> 04:48.521
has had a turn.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.390
Every time you win a challenge,

04:50.456 --> 04:52.659
you win a stake for your team.

04:55.762 --> 04:58.164
But on the fourth round,

04:58.231 --> 05:00.900
one person from each team
will have to complete

05:00.967 --> 05:04.203
-all three challenges.
-Oh, my God.

05:04.270 --> 05:06.039
-I like it.
-KEOGHAN: If you win that,

05:06.105 --> 05:08.441
you will get two stakes.

05:08.508 --> 05:10.209
-(contestants oohing)
-So you got to think

05:10.276 --> 05:12.845
very carefully about
who that person is.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.048
First team to collect
five stakes

05:15.114 --> 05:17.383
wins today's team competition,

05:17.450 --> 05:20.420
$12,000, and today's
Badge of Honor.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.556
-KELSY: Yeah.
-Strategize,
think very carefully

05:23.623 --> 05:25.358
about your choices, 'cause
it could be the difference

05:25.425 --> 05:27.560
between winning and losing.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.896
-LIA: Who's feeling it?
-KALIMBA: I'll go first.

05:29.962 --> 05:31.230
Who do you want me
to call out, guys?

05:31.297 --> 05:32.965
-Call out Mike.
-We call out Mike first.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.802
If she calls out Mike, then
they're gonna do the concrete.

05:35.868 --> 05:37.537
-Get him out of the way.
-Get him first with Quincey,

05:37.603 --> 05:39.172
-not with Kalimba.
-CHRISTINE: Yeah.

05:39.238 --> 05:40.139
Okay.

05:40.206 --> 05:41.507
-Quincey and Mike.
-Yeah.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.142
The first challenge
was critical with strategy,

05:43.209 --> 05:46.212
<i>just because once you do</i>
<i>a challenge, you're done</i>

05:46.279 --> 05:47.747
until you go through the rest
of the team members.

05:47.814 --> 05:51.150
So, we knew nobody else would
have to go up against Mike.

05:51.217 --> 05:53.052
DIRTY HANDS:
One, two, three, Dirty Hands!

05:53.119 --> 05:55.455
We get to choose
what that first challenge is.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.757
What do you think
you guys are strong at?

05:57.824 --> 05:59.492
I'm just, good mentally,
you know, so...

05:59.559 --> 06:01.394
Yeah, I'd be good
with the concrete.

06:01.461 --> 06:02.895
We need to be smart
on every decision.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.964
<i>HANGER:</i>
<i>We need to make sure</i>

06:05.031 --> 06:06.966
we utilize our skills
to the best of our ability...

06:07.033 --> 06:08.634
ALL:
Savage Crew!

06:08.701 --> 06:10.036
...so we can take this win.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.971
So, Quincey, you'll be
representing Dirty Hands,

06:12.038 --> 06:14.173
and who would you like
to pick from Savage Crew?

06:14.240 --> 06:15.274
QUINCEY:
I guess it would be a fit

06:15.341 --> 06:16.642
if me and Mike go together.
(laughs)

06:16.709 --> 06:17.810
MIKE:
All right.

06:17.877 --> 06:18.811
KEOGHAN:
Mike, did you have a feeling

06:18.878 --> 06:19.812
you might get picked out first?

06:19.879 --> 06:21.881
-I did, yeah.
-(laughter)

06:21.948 --> 06:24.684
So, Savage Crew,
you get to pick the discipline.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.319
We're gonna go on the concrete.
I think it's, you know...

06:26.385 --> 06:27.620
LIA:
Oh, no surprise.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.088
-Two bulldogs. Two bulldogs.
-MIKE: Right.

06:29.155 --> 06:30.223
-Big dogs.
-LIA: It'll be epic.

06:30.289 --> 06:32.091
We got a diesel mechanic

06:32.158 --> 06:34.927
against a lineman
smashing concrete...

06:34.994 --> 06:36.896
-(laughter)
-...here in a scrapyard.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.564
That's what you call
<i>Tough As Nails.</i>

06:38.631 --> 06:40.566
-Yeah.
-KEOGHAN: Shall we get to work?

06:40.633 --> 06:42.301
-Yeah!
-Let's go.
-All right, let's do it.

06:42.368 --> 06:43.402
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>I wasn't surprised</i>

06:43.469 --> 06:44.403
when Mike chose the concrete.

06:44.470 --> 06:45.505
ELIZABETH:
You got it, Mike.

06:45.571 --> 06:46.906
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>He already came up there</i>

06:46.973 --> 06:48.908
<i>with his guns out,</i>
<i>flexed his muscles a little bit,</i>

06:48.975 --> 06:50.009
and showed his tattoos.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.511
It's what America
want to see, baby.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.112
LIA:
Yeah, give America
what they want.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.447
KEOGHAN:
Gloves on,
let's make it a good one.

06:54.514 --> 06:55.748
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I love a good challenge,</i>

06:55.815 --> 06:58.184
he's a great competitor.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.419
<i>I do weigh more</i>
<i>than Quincey does,</i>

07:00.486 --> 07:03.723
so, you know, I got a lot
of concrete to break up.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.658
(work whistle blows)

07:05.725 --> 07:07.226
-SARAH: Go, Mike. Go.
-KELSY: You got it, Mike.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.362
KEOGHAN:
Lot of smashes
coming from Quincey.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.764
-Corners. Corners.
-Come on, come on.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.800
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>My strategy right away</i>
<i>was bust the corners.</i>

07:13.866 --> 07:15.001
Next corner, next corner.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.302
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>That way, you can work your way</i>

07:16.369 --> 07:17.503
<i>towards the middle</i>

07:17.570 --> 07:18.504
and get smaller pieces
in order to fit

07:18.571 --> 07:19.505
in that little five-inch hole.

07:19.572 --> 07:20.706
Yeah.

07:20.773 --> 07:21.841
-Get mad, get mad.
-HANGER: Yeah.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.676
-Mike, Mike.
-You can rest tonight.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.379
KEOGHAN:
Mike has almost broken up

07:26.445 --> 07:27.513
all his concrete.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.515
(whoops)
Using a lot of power.

07:29.582 --> 07:32.051
HANGER:
You're doing great, Mike,
you're doing great.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.920
I can't see Mike,
but I can hear him back there.

07:33.986 --> 07:35.555
-(cheering)
<i>-Just sounded like</i>

07:35.621 --> 07:37.423
cannons going off behind me.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.626
<i>So I-I know I got to pick it up.</i>

07:40.693 --> 07:41.894
-CHRISTINE: Breathe, breathe.
-Breathe.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.095
KEOGHAN:
Quincey starting to load.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.831
Using his hand as a hammer.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.532
-You see that? Boom.
-He's got hammer-hand.

07:46.599 --> 07:49.669
KEOGHAN:
Looking for pieces
that will weight this down.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.838
First to tip the scale gets
the first stake for their team.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.906
<i>-MIKE: It's not easy.</i>
-SARAH: Yo, ditch it, ditch it.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.842
MIKE:
Some of the pieces are too big.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.210
-HANGER: Come on.
-Keep going, Mike.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.412
KEOGHAN:
Mike smashing a piece
on the ground.

07:59.478 --> 08:01.214
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>So I start smashing</i>
<i>as hard as I could,</i>

08:01.280 --> 08:03.015
but, you know,
you feel like you're just going

08:03.082 --> 08:05.785
-in slow motion.
-KEOGHAN: Oh.

08:05.852 --> 08:08.354
Lost a bit of time there.
Here comes Quincey again.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.622
Look at the way
he's sliding up the hammer.

08:09.689 --> 08:10.790
Excellent technique.

08:12.925 --> 08:15.027
Oh, this is gonna be close.

08:15.094 --> 08:17.830
Both Quincey and Mike have
to have smashed enough concrete

08:17.897 --> 08:21.033
to tip a scale with their weight
on the other side.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.569
Oh, Quincey's starting
to teeter a wee bit.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.071
-TAK: Come on, Quincey.
-HANGER: There's a skinny one.

08:25.137 --> 08:26.205
There you go. Right there,
right there, right there.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.540
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

08:28.741 --> 08:29.842
-(cheering)
-And Quincey gets the win.

08:29.909 --> 08:31.244
(whoops)

08:32.411 --> 08:35.715
-CHRISTINE: Yes.
-(cheering, applause)

08:35.781 --> 08:38.751
<i>QUINCEY: Putting that spike n</i>
<i>for my team, it felt good.</i>

08:38.818 --> 08:41.454
Round one, we're 1-0.
Still got a ways to go.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.291
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>This is our last team challenge,</i>
<i>and ultimately,</i>

08:45.358 --> 08:46.659
I failed.

08:46.726 --> 08:50.296
<i>(sighs) I'm just glad</i>
<i>it's not over yet.</i>

08:50.363 --> 08:51.497
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew,

08:51.564 --> 08:52.798
you have the next pick.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.433
Take a moment to strategize.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.701
What can we do at this point?

08:55.768 --> 08:56.869
KELSY:
We have either grinder and bike,

08:56.936 --> 08:58.371
that they have to pick from.

08:58.437 --> 08:59.639
If we do Kalimba,

08:59.705 --> 09:01.741
I feel like she's gonna pick
the grinder.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.409
I like Sarah,
because Sarah can do either.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.443
I'm cool.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.112
We have to get a point.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.480
<i>No matter what Kalimba picks,</i>

09:07.546 --> 09:10.416
Sarah is a strong competitor
on our end.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.885
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew going with Sarah.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.788
-Who would you like to pick?
-We're gonna pick Kalimba.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.890
-You called me out, girl?
-(laughter)

09:17.957 --> 09:19.225
KEOGHAN:
Kalimba, have you made

09:19.292 --> 09:21.694
-a decision?
-We're gonna do the bike.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.763
Sarah is probably
one of my closest friends here.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.498
There's nobody else
that I'd rather go up against.

09:25.564 --> 09:28.968
We have a fire captain
against a cement mason.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.503
Dirty Hands have one stake,

09:30.569 --> 09:33.306
Savage Crew trying
to even it up.

09:33.372 --> 09:35.241
-(work whistle blows)
-(applause)

09:35.308 --> 09:37.910
Nice and smooth.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.578
-HANGER: Come on, Sarah.
-KEOGHAN: Kalimba's moving

09:39.645 --> 09:40.780
very quickly
with that long chain.

09:40.846 --> 09:42.682
When I'm not working
as a fire captain,

09:42.748 --> 09:44.116
<i>I work at a day care,</i>

09:44.183 --> 09:47.153
<i>and I'm untying knots</i>
<i>on shoes all the time.</i>

09:47.219 --> 09:48.187
I'm hoping that translates.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.323
Good job, Kalimba.

09:50.389 --> 09:52.925
-KELSY: Pick it up.
-KEOGHAN: Sarah's struggling
with that chain, it's tight.

09:54.126 --> 09:55.861
<i>SARAH:</i>
<i>I realized I had</i>

09:55.928 --> 09:56.896
wasted time starting
at the wrong end.

09:56.963 --> 09:58.230
Sarah, pick it up.

09:58.297 --> 09:59.765
Come on, come on.

09:59.832 --> 10:01.734
<i>SARAH:</i>
<i>The only way</i>
<i>I could make time up</i>

10:01.801 --> 10:03.436
<i>was follow the chain through...</i>

10:03.502 --> 10:05.137
KELSY:
Good job, Sarah.

10:05.204 --> 10:08.240
<i>...and just not get too panicky</i>
<i>when things aren't going my way.</i>

10:08.307 --> 10:09.909
-Just stay in it.
-KEOGHAN: Cement mason Sarah

10:09.976 --> 10:11.377
is good at working
with her hands.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.611
-This is close.
-Right on.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.347
<i>KALIMBA:</i>
<i>There's just a lot of chain</i>

10:14.413 --> 10:15.448
<i>to bring through.</i>

10:15.514 --> 10:16.949
You got to hurry up.
She right there.

10:17.016 --> 10:18.150
<i>KALIMBA:</i>
<i>I hear Jerome say, "Oh, no,</i>

10:18.217 --> 10:19.919
<i>-she's right there."</i>
-Move. Go, go.

10:19.986 --> 10:22.021
<i>KALIMBA:</i>
<i>So I started panicking</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

10:22.088 --> 10:24.090
-Okay, good job. Go.
-Come on, Sarah. You got it.

10:24.156 --> 10:25.091
TAK:
There you go, there you go,

10:25.157 --> 10:26.325
there you go, there you go.

10:26.392 --> 10:27.693
-Come on, come on.
-Kalimba's got a huge

10:27.760 --> 10:29.762
-amount of chain.
-QUINCEY: There you go.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.163
Go, go, go. Yep.

10:32.398 --> 10:34.734
-Come on, come on.
-Sarah's very close.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.069
KEOGHAN:
Kalimba's got her chain
caught around the crank.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.204
KELSY:
Yep, you got it.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.172
HANGER:
Oh, oh, you got it.

10:40.239 --> 10:41.273
Come on, come on!

10:41.340 --> 10:42.708
HANGER:
Come on.

10:42.775 --> 10:45.011
KEOGHAN:
And Sarah gets the job done!

10:45.077 --> 10:47.646
(cheering, applause)

10:47.713 --> 10:50.316
-HANGER: Ooh, I love you.
<i>-SARAH: It feels really good</i>

10:50.383 --> 10:51.484
to put us back on the board.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.686
-(cheering, whooping)
-Boom!

10:53.753 --> 10:55.654
<i>Hopefully everybody's</i>
<i>momentum is up,</i>

10:55.721 --> 10:56.822
and we have a shot.

10:56.889 --> 10:59.558
Team score now stands
at one apiece.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.127
(applause)

11:01.193 --> 11:02.428
We go back to Dirty Hands.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.296
You need to put up a competitor.

11:04.363 --> 11:05.431
I'm next, Phil.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.866
-Lia, you're next?
-Yep.

11:06.932 --> 11:09.502
We want to save the big guns
for a little later on.

11:09.568 --> 11:11.003
Who have you chosen
to go against?

11:11.070 --> 11:12.872
Picked my good friend Kelsy.

11:12.938 --> 11:15.508
And we know what's left
to compete on.

11:15.574 --> 11:16.842
The grinder.

11:16.909 --> 11:18.611
KEOGHAN:
We're going to the grinder.

11:18.677 --> 11:19.912
I have multiple grinders
around my hangar.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.847
<i>My grinder's</i>
<i>a little bit smaller,</i>

11:21.914 --> 11:24.250
but we're tied up one to one.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.052
<i>I just want to go out</i>
<i>with a bang.</i>

11:26.118 --> 11:29.255
Kelsy, our crop duster,
going up against Lia,

11:29.321 --> 11:31.090
our Jill-of-all-trades.

11:31.157 --> 11:32.658
(work whistle blows)

11:37.430 --> 11:38.497
SARAH:
Keep it straight.

11:38.564 --> 11:39.732
JEROME:
Let the blade do the work.

11:39.799 --> 11:41.300
<i>LIA:</i>
<i>One thing I've done recently</i>

11:41.367 --> 11:43.135
<i>is small engine repair.</i>

11:43.202 --> 11:44.470
Working with lawn mower blades,

11:44.537 --> 11:47.706
<i>I-I use a grinder</i>
<i>to get out the big nicks</i>

11:47.773 --> 11:49.909
-in the blades.
-QUINCEY: No pressure, Lia.
No pressure.

11:49.975 --> 11:51.844
<i>LIA:</i>
<i>My goal is to keep ahead</i>
<i>of Kelsy</i>

11:51.911 --> 11:54.580
-and get us that second stake.
-SARAH: Less pressure.

11:54.647 --> 11:55.614
Oh, ah.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.584
ELIZABETH:
Let the blade work for you.

11:58.651 --> 11:59.685
MIKE:
Let the blade work it for you.

11:59.752 --> 12:00.853
<i>KELSY:</i>
<i>My tools back home</i>

12:00.920 --> 12:02.521
are a lot more lightweight.

12:02.588 --> 12:06.225
<i>It's so heavy that I'm not</i>
<i>getting that blade in straight.</i>

12:06.292 --> 12:07.726
SARAH:
Straighten the wheel, Kelsy,

12:07.793 --> 12:09.261
straighten the wheel.

12:09.328 --> 12:10.563
Ooh.

12:17.303 --> 12:19.505
KEOGHAN: Kelsy and Lia
facing off on the grinder

12:19.572 --> 12:21.207
in our battle of the trades.

12:21.273 --> 12:22.641
SARAH:
Kelsy, keep it light.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.510
KEOGHAN:
We're tied up at one stake each.

12:24.577 --> 12:28.314
First team to collect five
of them will get the $12,000.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.349
Keep it straight, Kelsy.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.684
KEOGHAN:
Ooh.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.319
<i>KELSY:</i>
<i>And I'm not getting that blae</i>

12:33.385 --> 12:35.554
-as straight as it needs to be.
-SARAH: Right there.

12:35.621 --> 12:36.922
<i>KELSY:</i>
<i>So I was trying to get up</i>
<i>on top of it</i>

12:36.989 --> 12:38.157
<i>so I could see.</i>

12:38.224 --> 12:40.426
That's it.
That's better, that's better.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.095
Lia rotating her pipe.

12:44.964 --> 12:47.600
Turn the pipe, Kelsy,
turn the pipe.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.735
Line it right up
with that first cut. Good.

12:49.802 --> 12:52.438
KEOGHAN:
Jill-of-all-trades
is almost through.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.106
JEROME:
Yeah, you can
break them off already.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.908
HANGER:
Give it all you got.
Do not slow down.

12:55.975 --> 12:58.911
KEOGHAN:
Has she got enough
to get it done?

12:58.978 --> 13:00.746
And Lia drops the pipe.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.316
And Lia gets the job done.

13:04.383 --> 13:05.384
Good job.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.587
<i>KELSY:</i>
<i>Wasn't my day on that grinde.</i>

Ugh, it's frustrating.

Team score now:
two stakes to Dirty Hands,

13:14.160 --> 13:16.428
one stake to Savage Crew.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.464
-But we know what happens next.
-Yeah.

-Fourth round.
-The fourth round.

-KELSY: That's right.
<i>-ALFIE: For the fourth round,</i>

13:21.901 --> 13:23.969

13:24.036 --> 13:25.638
all the disciplines.

13:25.704 --> 13:29.208
<i>Taking the chain off the bik,</i>
<i>the cutting of the pipe,</i>

13:29.275 --> 13:31.277
<i>breaking up concrete,</i>

two stakes.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.214
<i>It gets real serious right now.</i>

Okay, so, who do we want
to represent us?

13:37.917 --> 13:39.685
I would like to say Elizabeth.

13:39.752 --> 13:40.853
Power-to-weight ratio
with the concrete?

13:40.920 --> 13:41.921
-That's a good point.
-I've got it.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.122
<i>ELIZABETH:</i>
<i>I feel like</i>

13:43.189 --> 13:44.990
we do have a chance

13:45.057 --> 13:47.726
<i>I have learned from watching</i>
<i>each discipline,</i>

13:47.793 --> 13:50.863
<i>so I feel confident</i>
<i>that I can win this challeng.</i>

13:50.930 --> 13:51.964
Maybe Christine can do it.

13:52.031 --> 13:53.065
Do you want to do all three?

13:53.132 --> 13:54.800
I mean, I'm used
to cutting pipe,

13:54.867 --> 13:56.135
I'm good with a grinder.

13:56.202 --> 13:57.436
Okay, Christine doing the three.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.071
-We want you to do it.
-Okay.

13:59.138 --> 14:00.472
I would like another
two grand in our pockets.

14:00.539 --> 14:01.874
<i>I know it's a little bit</i>
<i>more pressure,</i>

14:01.941 --> 14:03.409
two spikes you can get
instead of one.

14:03.475 --> 14:06.979
<i>I need to stay calm and</i>
<i>not let Savage Crew get ahea.</i>

14:07.046 --> 14:09.348

-KEOGHAN: And Christine's
bike free.
-LIA: You got this.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.359
<i>CHRISTINE:</i>
<i>The chains just took forever,</i>

14:53.425 --> 14:55.394
but I'm very proficient
with a grinder.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.563
LIA:
Come on, Christine.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.398
-Nice, nice.
-This is where I got
to make up the time.

14:59.465 --> 15:01.166
Yeah, you got it.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.136
Christine's starting down low.

15:04.203 --> 15:05.704
Steady hand.

15:11.343 --> 15:13.145
MIKE:
Her blade's frickin'
wearing out.

15:13.212 --> 15:15.414
-KELSY: Oh, wow.
-MIKE: She's pushing

15:15.481 --> 15:17.082
-too hard into it.
-KALIMBA: Come on, Christine.

15:17.149 --> 15:18.951
-HANGER: Come on, Elizabeth.
-KEOGHAN: Christine's blade

15:19.018 --> 15:20.119
is worn all the way down.

15:20.185 --> 15:22.154
KELSY:
Oh, yeah. Yeah!

15:22.221 --> 15:24.723
-Good job!
-And Elizabeth gets it done.

15:24.790 --> 15:26.058
KELSY:
Over. Let's go!

15:26.125 --> 15:27.660
-Good job, good job.
-Way to go, Elizabeth.

15:27.726 --> 15:29.094
-JEROME: Got to change
your blade.
-LIA: Change your blade.

15:29.161 --> 15:30.663
KEOGHAN:
Christine's looking
to change out the blade.

15:30.729 --> 15:32.131
This is gonna eat up time.

15:32.197 --> 15:34.166
Elizabeth's moved on
to the smashing.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.801
She's down on her knees,
she's using her flexibility,

15:35.868 --> 15:37.936
she wants to keep
those pieces small.

15:38.003 --> 15:40.272
MIKE:
Let her do her thing,
let her do her thing.

15:40.339 --> 15:42.041
ELIZABETH:
As a general contractor,

15:42.107 --> 15:43.909
I bust out concrete
every day by hand.

15:43.976 --> 15:45.678
-ALFIE: Good.
-KELSY: It's not gonna
take much of that.

15:45.744 --> 15:47.546
ELIZABETH:
I know I can do
very small movements

15:47.613 --> 15:49.114
and it would break
really easily.

15:49.181 --> 15:51.050
-HANGER: She's comfortable.
-I've done it my whole life.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.886
KEOGHAN:
Can Christine catch up?

15:53.952 --> 15:56.155
And she finally gets it done.

15:56.221 --> 15:58.390
-KALIMBA: Now come on,
you got it.
-LIA: Go, go, go, go.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.159
-TAK: Let's go.
-KALIMBA: Corners, corners.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.328
-KEOGHAN: Catch-up time.
-LIA: There you go,
there you go.

16:02.394 --> 16:03.562
From the outside.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.664
Christine is hitting
a lot harder.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.232
KEOGHAN:
Elizabeth,
that's a new technique.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.500
We haven't seen that before.

16:08.567 --> 16:09.668
<i>ELIZABETH:</i>
<i>If I can load it up in my shirt</i>

16:09.735 --> 16:11.337
as much as I can carry
every trip,

16:11.403 --> 16:13.772
<i>-that would save me some tim.</i>
-Wow.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.474
-KALIMBA: Go, go.
-Go, go, go, go, go.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.176
-KALIMBA: All the big ones.
-Christine starting in

16:17.242 --> 16:19.111
with some big pieces.

16:19.178 --> 16:20.379
-LIA: You got it.
-KEOGHAN: Remember that each
has to smash

16:20.446 --> 16:21.914
their body weight in concrete.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.215
-JEROME: There you go.
-It's got to go through

16:23.282 --> 16:24.516
-a tight hole.
-LIA: Hit it with another one.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.352
-Hit it with another one.
-Five by five inches.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.287
LIA:
There you go. There you go.

16:28.354 --> 16:29.755
KEOGHAN:
Elizabeth back to her T-shirt.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.623
-Wow. All right, look at this.
-You're in the game.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.292
-You're in the game.
-She wants this win
for her team.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.494
QUINCEY:
There you go.
Put them all in there.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.896
Come on, Christine, move fast.

16:37.963 --> 16:38.997
-It's starting to move.
-KELSY: Go, go, go,

16:39.064 --> 16:40.199
go, go, go!

16:40.265 --> 16:42.067
-HANGER: Oh, oh, oh!
-KELSY: Yeah!

16:42.134 --> 16:44.570
-Oh, my gosh!
-KEOGHAN: And Elizabeth

16:44.636 --> 16:45.771
gets the job done!

16:45.838 --> 16:47.072
(cheering, applause)

16:48.574 --> 16:50.075
KEOGHAN:
Two stakes for Savage Crew...

16:50.142 --> 16:51.777
-(cheering)
-...and that brings the score

16:51.844 --> 16:53.679
to 3-2.

16:57.916 --> 16:59.618
<i>ELIZABETH:</i>
<i>I feel really good.</i>
<i>I got two pins.</i>

16:59.685 --> 17:02.321
That let us take the lead,
but it's not over.

17:02.388 --> 17:04.523
<i>Now I just have to sit back</i>
<i>and let my teammates</i>

17:04.590 --> 17:06.225
do the rest of the work
unless it comes around again.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.260
KEOGHAN:
Dirty Hands, you still have
a chance to catch up.

17:08.327 --> 17:09.428
Absolutely.

17:09.495 --> 17:11.697
Savage Crew,
you've got the next pick.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.198
My righteous brother Jerome.

17:13.265 --> 17:14.500
Jerome, how do you feel
about that?

17:14.566 --> 17:15.667
-I was waiting all day.
-You were...

17:15.734 --> 17:16.935
-(laughter)
-JEROME: Come on.

17:17.002 --> 17:18.537
-What would you like to do?
-Want to cut.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.172
Get to your grinders,
let's get to work.

17:23.675 --> 17:24.710
(work whistle blows)

17:26.278 --> 17:27.546
KEOGHAN:
Hanger wants
to bring it for his team.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.681
-Keep moving, keep moving.
-CHRISTINE: Rotate.

17:29.748 --> 17:30.983
KEOGHAN:
Not if Jerome can help it.

17:31.049 --> 17:32.684
LIA:
Nice, Jerome. Nice.

17:32.751 --> 17:34.653
<i>JEROME:</i>
<i>When Hanger picked me,</i>
<i>he did the wrong move.</i>

17:34.720 --> 17:36.488
All my life, um,
from 17 years old to now,

17:36.555 --> 17:38.490
<i>I use the grinder.</i>

17:38.557 --> 17:40.259

Straighten it up.
Straighten it up.

KEOGHAN:
Hanger's fighting that blade.

17:41.894 --> 17:42.961
Oh, wrong move, brah.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.096
KEOGHAN:
He just burned up that blade.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.031
Jerome keeping it smooth,

17:46.098 --> 17:47.666
still on his first blade.

17:47.733 --> 17:48.901
<i>JEROME:</i>
<i>Yeah, I could have</i>

17:52.438 --> 17:54.540
KEOGHAN:
And Jerome gets the job done,

17:54.606 --> 17:56.475

17:57.543 --> 17:58.777
TAK:
Yes, sir, brother.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.048

<i>HANGER:</i>
<i>31 years utilizing a grinder.</i>

18:06.685 --> 18:08.053

"What are you doing, Hanger?"

18:09.888 --> 18:12.257
KEOGHAN:
Alfie and Tak,
the only two left

18:12.324 --> 18:13.826
who haven't competed.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.761
You're gonna go head-to-head
and see who can break the tie.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.932

<i>TAK:</i>
<i>Unraveling the chains</i>
<i>off this bike,</i>

18:32.711 --> 18:34.179
<i>it's kind of like a puzzle.</i>

I'm not really good at puzzles,

-You got to get that one out.
<i>-TAK: In this challenge,</i>

18:45.090 --> 18:47.993
everything relies on "I"
and not "we."

18:48.060 --> 18:49.962
<i>So I can't give up.</i>

18:51.763 --> 18:54.199
-KEOGHAN: Alfie ripping
through this chain.

There is one challenge
left over there.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.962
Savage Crew, you now
have to pick somebody

19:24.029 --> 19:27.466
to compete, and someone from
Dirty Hands to compete against.

19:27.533 --> 19:28.467
SARAH:
If Elizabeth does it,
we have to still

19:28.534 --> 19:29.468
pick somebody who hasn't...

19:29.535 --> 19:31.436
-Kalimba, Kalimba.
-Exactly.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.804
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew,
have you made a decision?

19:32.871 --> 19:35.541
We're gonna go with Elizabeth

19:35.607 --> 19:36.608
against Kalimba.

19:39.545 --> 19:40.512
Let's go.

19:40.579 --> 19:41.780
KEOGHAN:
Okay.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.350
Elizabeth did really well
in round four,

19:45.417 --> 19:46.718
<i>but as a firefighter,</i>

19:46.785 --> 19:48.220
I've worked with
a sledgehammer quite a bit.

<i>It doesn't make me nervous.</i>

Savage Crew, one stake away

19:56.828 --> 19:58.730

team challenge.

19:58.797 --> 19:59.998
We need this so bad.

This is our last chance

to take $12,000 home
for our families.

Big power coming from Kalimba.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.631
Going around the outside,
making some big smashes.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.066
-Yep, yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

20:34.132 --> 20:35.834
KEOGHAN:
Elizabeth going back
to her old technique

20:35.901 --> 20:39.438
of getting down low,
making small pieces.

20:39.504 --> 20:41.306
-There you go, there you go.
<i>-SARAH: Elizabeth and Kalimba</i>

20:46.311 --> 20:47.713
<i>to take the win.</i>

20:47.779 --> 20:50.649
KEOGHAN:
Kalimba smashes them down
on the ground.

20:50.716 --> 20:53.018
She's got to try to break up
these bigger pieces.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.653
Elizabeth, back
to the T-shirt technique.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.688
Everybody around the country

this technique now.
-Oh, yeah.

KEOGHAN:
Ah, Kalimba's trying
the same thing.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.927
Going with the T-shirt.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.662
Kalimba has learned
from watching her competition.

21:03.729 --> 21:05.030
That's smart.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.066
Elizabeth is firing her pieces
into the scale.

21:43.635 --> 21:45.270
Since there's no crew boss,
hand it through your team.

21:45.337 --> 21:47.272
Everybody should get
a touch of that.

21:47.339 --> 21:49.608
And also, $12,000.

We showed each other the most

22:23.942 --> 22:25.644
-unconditional love today.
-Yeah.

22:25.711 --> 22:27.979
MIKE: And you guys now
are gonna be part

22:28.046 --> 22:29.181
-of my family at home, too.
-HANGER: Absolutely.

22:29.247 --> 22:30.716
KELSY:
Yeah, absolutely.

22:30.782 --> 22:32.017
You know, I start knocking
on your back door,

22:32.084 --> 22:34.586
-you better have dinner for me.
-(laughter)

22:34.653 --> 22:36.955
I'll have the dog bowl
out for you.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.724
-HANGER: Hey, I'll take it.
<i>-MIKE: It's the weight off</i>

22:38.790 --> 22:40.258
<i>of my shoulders,</i>
<i>getting redemption.</i>

22:40.325 --> 22:42.060
<i>We're all happy,</i>
<i>and we're smiling.</i>

22:42.127 --> 22:43.695
<i>Now I can just focus on going</i>

22:43.762 --> 22:45.297
to the individual competition.

22:45.363 --> 22:47.999
<i>That $200,000</i>
<i>is getting closer for me,</i>

22:48.066 --> 22:49.968
<i>and I'm fighting</i>
<i>for my family at home.</i>

22:50.035 --> 22:51.303
KELSY:
Mike and Elizabeth,

22:51.369 --> 22:53.271
don't worry about us, like,
we have your back.

22:53.338 --> 22:55.907
Mike's gonna be running hard
to keep up with me.

22:55.974 --> 22:57.142
-MIKE: I am.
-(laughter)

23:04.549 --> 23:05.817
CHRISTINE:
It's officially over.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.252
-The teams...
-Yeah, it's officially over.

23:07.319 --> 23:08.653
Oh, yeah.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.021
(sighs)
Bittersweet.

23:10.088 --> 23:11.923
QUINCEY:
There's five people
left competing.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.058
-Three Dirty Hands, right?
-CHRISTINE: Yep.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.726
Three Dirty Hands
and two Savage Crew.

23:14.793 --> 23:16.495
I mean, everybody
in this van is,

23:16.561 --> 23:18.263
just, has the biggest heart
and is super caring.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.732
-LIA: Yeah.
-I love Quincey's smile.

23:20.799 --> 23:23.001
And I also love the way
you love your family,

23:23.068 --> 23:24.236
and the way you speak
of your family,

23:24.302 --> 23:25.637
and your parents
and where you grew up.

23:25.704 --> 23:26.938
Thank you.

23:27.005 --> 23:29.274
-Lia, I love your determination.
-Yeah.

23:29.341 --> 23:31.476
KALIMBA:
And I also love
how you're just a truly,

23:31.543 --> 23:33.612
like, genuine
and authentic person

23:33.678 --> 23:37.716
that hasn't let struggles
in your life define you.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.317
LIA:
Wow.

23:39.384 --> 23:42.621
KALIMBA:
Jerome, you are the most,
like, straight-up person...

23:42.687 --> 23:45.323
This weird, you guys.
Stop it, for real.

23:45.390 --> 23:47.092
-CHRISTINE: But we love you.
-You guys weird right now
about it.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.227
-Don't even say nothing...
-(laughter)

23:49.294 --> 23:51.096
And I love how one
of you guys are going to win.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.098
CHRISTINE:
You guys better bring
your A-plus game today.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.966
-KALIMBA: Yes.
-TAK: Let's go.

23:56.802 --> 23:58.436
-JEROME: Man...
-KELSY: Oh...

23:58.503 --> 24:01.072
MIKE:
This looks pretty fun.

24:01.139 --> 24:02.641
-Good morning.
-CONTESTANTS: Morning, Phil.

24:02.707 --> 24:05.177
KEOGHAN:
Welcome to today's jobsite.

24:05.243 --> 24:07.179
The team competition is over,

24:07.245 --> 24:09.581
we are down
to the individual competition.

24:09.648 --> 24:12.117
Because we're working
in a confined space,

24:12.184 --> 24:14.719
I'm gonna ask those of you
who are not competing today

24:14.786 --> 24:15.921
to go and wait for us
in overtime.

24:15.987 --> 24:17.923
The rest of you, stay here

24:17.989 --> 24:20.659
and I'll tell you
what your job is.

24:20.725 --> 24:22.460
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>It's down to the final five.</i>

24:22.527 --> 24:23.929
Somebody gonna be
punching out today.

24:23.995 --> 24:25.530
<i>If I win the $200,000,</i>

24:25.597 --> 24:27.299
<i>it'll mean so much</i>
<i>to me and my family.</i>

24:27.365 --> 24:28.800
<i>You know, I didn't come</i>
<i>this far to turn back now,</i>

24:28.867 --> 24:31.169
<i>so, you know, I'm all in.</i>

24:31.236 --> 24:34.406
It's gonna get busy in here
real fast.

24:34.472 --> 24:36.374
There is a serious shortage
of wood right now,

24:36.441 --> 24:39.811
so the recycling pallet business
is exploding.

24:39.878 --> 24:42.314
Up and down this street, the
price is constantly changing.

24:42.380 --> 24:43.615
Look over there, look at that.

24:43.682 --> 24:45.717
The price is changing right now.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.018
Guy just changed the price.

24:47.085 --> 24:49.754
-Now it's $5.50.
-LIA: Supply and demand.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.189
KEOGHAN:
In all seriousness,
up and down this street,

24:51.256 --> 24:52.591
that happens all the time.

24:52.657 --> 24:55.160
See the pallets behind you?

24:55.227 --> 24:57.462
-They're all smashed up?
-Oh, yeah.

24:57.529 --> 24:58.630
You would think that someone
might just throw that

24:58.697 --> 24:59.931
in a dumpster, but no.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.733
Hugely valuable.

25:01.800 --> 25:06.004
Your job today is to repair
ten pallets.

25:06.071 --> 25:08.874
Got to do it as fast
as you possibly can.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.810
When the work whistle blows,
grab a pallet,

25:11.877 --> 25:13.478
take it to the workstations.

25:13.545 --> 25:16.414
<i>First, you got to remove</i>
<i>all the broken slats</i>

25:16.481 --> 25:18.116
<i>off both sides of the pallet.</i>

25:18.183 --> 25:20.919
<i>Make sure all the stray nails</i>
<i>are flushly hammered in</i>

25:20.986 --> 25:22.520
<i>or pulled out.</i>

25:22.587 --> 25:24.289
All the tools you need
to get the job done

25:24.356 --> 25:26.191
are laid out on the jobsite.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.994
<i>And each of you have a stack</i>
<i>of useable slats</i>

25:29.060 --> 25:31.029
<i>to replace the broken ones.</i>

25:31.096 --> 25:32.964
<i>Keep in mind that they're</i>
<i>all different sizes,</i>

25:33.031 --> 25:35.834
<i>so many will need</i>
<i>to be trimmed to fit.</i>

25:35.901 --> 25:37.769
<i>The first of you</i>
<i>to complete ten pallets</i>

25:37.836 --> 25:40.038
<i>and hang your hammer</i>
<i>on the wall,</i>

25:40.105 --> 25:42.974
will be the winner
of today's challenge.

25:43.041 --> 25:46.077
The last two of you to finish
the job will go into overtime,

25:46.144 --> 25:47.279
and by the end of the day,

25:47.345 --> 25:49.247
one more of you
will be punching out,

25:49.314 --> 25:52.284
losing your shot at getting
into the final four.

25:52.350 --> 25:55.453
The good news is:
if you win today's job,

25:55.520 --> 26:00.058
you will get a 566-piece
mechanic's tool kit.

26:00.125 --> 26:01.259
-Sounds great.
-ELIZABETH: Hey.

26:01.326 --> 26:02.527
KEOGHAN:
Okay, everybody.

26:02.594 --> 26:03.628
Ready to get to work?

26:03.695 --> 26:06.064
-ALL: Yeah!
-Grab a workstation.

26:06.131 --> 26:08.533
<i>ELIZABETH:</i>
<i>Thinking about the people</i>
<i>I'm going up against.</i>

26:08.600 --> 26:10.035
Quincey is very focused,

26:10.101 --> 26:11.603
<i>very detail-oriented.</i>

26:11.670 --> 26:14.105
<i>Jerome is very calm</i>
<i>and very relaxed.</i>

26:14.172 --> 26:16.007
<i>Mike's got a lot of strength.</i>

26:16.074 --> 26:18.343
<i>And then Lia can have</i>
<i>incredible speed.</i>

26:18.410 --> 26:20.545
<i>So they're not gonna</i>
<i>make it easy for me.</i>

26:20.612 --> 26:22.414
KEOGHAN: All right,
I'm gonna get Guillermo in here,

26:22.480 --> 26:23.581
he's gonna check out your work.

26:23.648 --> 26:25.283
He owns this place. Guillermo.

26:25.350 --> 26:28.453
Thanks for coming out.
Make sure they do a good job.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.155
On the work whistle.

26:30.221 --> 26:31.923
(work whistle blows)

26:43.168 --> 26:45.403
Jerome's coming back
for another pallet,

26:45.470 --> 26:48.039
and being very methodical
with his selection.

26:48.106 --> 26:50.075
<i>JEROME:</i>
<i>The pile of broken pallets,</i>

26:50.141 --> 26:52.243
you couldn't take the top one,
you have to go find the ones

26:52.310 --> 26:54.012
<i>with less damage on them.</i>

26:54.079 --> 26:56.414
<i>So, look</i>
<i>for the easiest pallets.</i>

26:56.481 --> 26:59.484
<i>Less to repair.</i>
<i>That's the challenge.</i>

27:02.787 --> 27:05.657
Remember, you've got to get
ten pallets complete today.

27:05.724 --> 27:09.494
Last two of you
going into overtime.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.863
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>We have to smash</i>
<i>the old boards out</i>

27:11.930 --> 27:14.132
<i>that are cracked or broken</i>
<i>and then grab</i>

27:14.199 --> 27:15.800
<i>a new board from the pile.</i>

27:15.867 --> 27:17.902
Use the air nailer
to nail it in.

27:20.071 --> 27:22.941
My boards were all longer
than my pallets, so,

27:23.008 --> 27:24.242
<i>you know, I took the handsaw</i>

27:24.309 --> 27:25.710
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>started cutting them.</i>

27:30.749 --> 27:32.884
That thing was flimsy.
(laughs)

27:34.652 --> 27:37.389
Nice. Thank the Lord.

27:37.455 --> 27:41.092
KEOGHAN:
Whoa, Jerome with
the first pallet complete.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.328
And he's off to the pile
to get a second.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.829
Guillermo, what do you think?

27:44.896 --> 27:46.731
Oh, yeah. Ready to go,
ready to go.

27:46.798 --> 27:49.501
KEOGHAN: Thumbs-up, Jerome.
One pallet complete.

27:49.567 --> 27:52.937
<i>ELIZABETH:</i>
<i>My first pallet I selected</i>
<i>was severely damaged.</i>

27:53.004 --> 27:55.206
<i>I'm taking forever to repair it.</i>

27:55.273 --> 27:57.175
I really want to avoid overtime.

27:57.242 --> 27:59.411
<i>Jerome is already</i>
<i>on his second pallet,</i>

27:59.477 --> 28:01.413
<i>and I'm still working</i>
<i>on my first?</i>

28:01.479 --> 28:04.182
If this happens again,
I-- it's over for me, I'm done.

28:05.483 --> 28:07.352
KEOGHAN: Mike,
you have one pallet complete.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.454
Thumbs-up, Quincey, one for you.

28:09.521 --> 28:13.024
Thumbs-up, Lia,
one pallet complete.

28:13.091 --> 28:15.927
Elizabeth, you have a pass,
first pallet complete.

28:15.994 --> 28:18.863
Jerome takes the lead
with two finished pallets.

28:27.672 --> 28:30.542
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>We started off with</i>
<i>12 individuals that are toug,</i>

28:30.608 --> 28:32.744
<i>and now we're down</i>
<i>to the final five.</i>

28:35.113 --> 28:37.115
It's coming right down
to the end here,

28:37.182 --> 28:42.020
<i>and there's no messing around</i>
<i>or no time for mistakes.</i>

28:42.087 --> 28:44.289
Jerome has the lead
at this point.

28:44.355 --> 28:46.591
Six on the stack,
working on the seventh.

28:46.658 --> 28:48.560
Elizabeth is starting
to catch up.

28:48.626 --> 28:49.994
Solid with five.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.863
Five complete, getting a sixth.

28:51.930 --> 28:54.232
I got a lot better
at my pallet selection,

28:54.299 --> 28:56.835
<i>and I was fortunate enough</i>
<i>to get several pallets</i>

28:56.901 --> 28:58.002
<i>where I didn't have</i>
<i>to cut any boards.</i>

28:58.069 --> 28:59.170
<i>I want this win.</i>

28:59.237 --> 29:00.338
KEOGHAN:
Mike has got four.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.073
Working on his fifth.

29:02.140 --> 29:05.276
Quincey, got four,
working on his fifth.

29:05.343 --> 29:09.147
And Lia with four,
working on her fifth.

29:09.214 --> 29:11.282
<i>LIA:</i>
<i>I use pallets on the farm,</i>
<i>where-- to keep the hay</i>

29:11.349 --> 29:14.185
up off the ground,
and feed in feed bins,

29:14.252 --> 29:15.687
<i>but nothing compared to this.</i>

29:15.753 --> 29:16.988
This was pretty intense.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.325
LIA:
I need a check down here!

29:21.326 --> 29:22.794
Let's inspect that, Guillermo.

29:22.861 --> 29:24.929
Ah, no, it's not gonna pass.
Look at that corner.

29:24.996 --> 29:26.598
Look at that corner.

29:26.664 --> 29:27.999
LIA:
Coming.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.501
-Too big a gap right there.
-What about this one?

29:29.567 --> 29:32.971
(groans)
I thought everything was right.

29:33.037 --> 29:37.175
Elizabeth and Jerome
coming down to the finish.

29:37.242 --> 29:40.011
Elizabeth, you're passed
on your ninth.

29:40.078 --> 29:42.347
-Yeah, he's passed this.
-KEOGHAN: Jerome gets
his ninth one.

29:42.413 --> 29:45.450
Elizabeth and Jerome
both at nine.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.853
Ten pallets, this to stay
in the final four.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.756
(whoops)
This is close, everybody.

29:59.030 --> 30:01.065
And Elizabeth looking
for a check on number ten.

30:02.667 --> 30:05.003
-Solid.
-Ten pallets for Elizabeth!

30:05.069 --> 30:07.372
-She gets the win.
-Good job, Elizabeth.

30:07.438 --> 30:10.041
-You got the tool kit,
566 tools.
-Yeah.

30:10.108 --> 30:12.443
-Congratulations.
Going through to the final four.
-GUILLERMO: Good job, Elizabeth.

30:12.510 --> 30:13.945
-Good job.
<i>-ELIZABETH: I made it</i>
<i>to the final four.</i>

30:14.012 --> 30:16.314
<i>And this win today</i>
<i>felt awesome for me,</i>

30:16.381 --> 30:19.751
because now I've got
two individual wins in a row.

30:19.817 --> 30:21.719
<i>I just need</i>
<i>to continue on that path.</i>

30:21.786 --> 30:24.656
KEOGHAN: And Jerome
with his tenth pallet complete.

30:24.722 --> 30:26.090
<i>JEROME:</i>
<i>Final four, I feel good.</i>

30:26.157 --> 30:28.626
Blessed for...
I come this far already.

30:28.693 --> 30:30.628
<i>One more challenge</i>
<i>closer to the prize.</i>

30:30.695 --> 30:32.230
Super excited.

30:32.297 --> 30:33.731
Nice job. Very nice job.

30:33.798 --> 30:36.634
Three competing,
only one spot left.

30:36.701 --> 30:38.670
Two of you going into overtime.

30:38.736 --> 30:42.640
Quincey knows what it's like to
be in overtime and so does Lia.

30:42.707 --> 30:44.475
Mike has never experienced it.

30:44.542 --> 30:45.977
Come on, Mike. You got it.

30:46.044 --> 30:48.713
Mike, you have
your ninth one complete.

30:48.780 --> 30:49.981
Going for his tenth.

30:50.048 --> 30:52.183
Go Quincey and Lia!

30:52.250 --> 30:54.953
Lia, you are good with nine,
you need one more.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.322
And Quincey,
right there with her,

30:57.388 --> 30:59.023
working on his ninth pallet.

31:00.792 --> 31:01.926
-JEROME: Uh-oh, uh-oh.
-ELIZABETH: What happened?

31:01.993 --> 31:03.428
KEOGHAN:
Quincey with a jammed-up
nail gun.

31:03.494 --> 31:04.596
He's gonna need
to get that cleared up

31:04.662 --> 31:06.297
before he carries on.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.099
ELIZABETH:
So close.

31:08.166 --> 31:11.502
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>I'm on a roll, and then</i>
<i>my nail gun gets jammed.</i>

31:11.569 --> 31:12.904
<i>And I start panicking</i>
<i>a little bit,</i>

31:12.971 --> 31:14.672
<i>because I know</i>
<i>we're all neck and neck.</i>

31:14.739 --> 31:16.908
<i>I got to get this thing fixed</i>

31:16.975 --> 31:18.610
and get it back going because

31:18.676 --> 31:20.378
I have to stay out
of overtime today.

31:20.445 --> 31:21.446
(groans)

31:22.714 --> 31:24.082
<i>-Damn.</i>
<i>-ELIZABETH AND JEROME: Uh-oh.</i>

31:31.222 --> 31:34.125
KEOGHAN:
Quincey, still trying
to get his nail gun working.

31:34.192 --> 31:36.227
He's gonna need to get that
cleared up before he carries on.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.363
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>Luckily, I got some experiene</i>
<i>with nail guns</i>

31:38.429 --> 31:40.098
<i>and-and-and power tools.</i>

31:40.164 --> 31:41.733
Go, Quincey and Lia!

31:44.102 --> 31:46.537
I was able to unjam my gun
and go back to work.

31:46.604 --> 31:48.139
KEOGHAN:
And nine is good for Quincey,

31:48.206 --> 31:50.041
working on his tenth.

31:50.108 --> 31:53.344
Lia, Quincey, Mike,
only one guaranteed spot

31:53.411 --> 31:55.680
left in the final four.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.649
None of you want to go
into overtime.

31:57.715 --> 31:58.883
Who's gonna be safe?

32:00.184 --> 32:02.053
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I'm sweating.</i>

32:02.120 --> 32:03.688
You got it, Mike. You got it.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.023
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>Lia's beside me,</i>

32:05.089 --> 32:06.791
<i>she's on the same number</i>

<i>Mike's on the other side of me,</i>

32:08.226 --> 32:09.794
<i>he on the same number</i>
<i>of pallets I'm on,</i>

32:09.861 --> 32:11.496
<i>and we're all just</i>
<i>neck and neck.</i>

32:11.562 --> 32:13.231
I can't afford to fall behind.

32:13.298 --> 32:15.033
<i>I got to pick up the pace here,</i>

32:15.099 --> 32:16.968
<i>because I'm not</i>
<i>punching out today.</i>

32:17.035 --> 32:19.804
KEOGHAN:
Quincey's sweating
like crazy now.

32:19.871 --> 32:20.872
-Gonna be close.
-Looks close, right?

32:20.938 --> 32:21.973
Look, he got a cut.

32:24.075 --> 32:26.210
KEOGHAN:
Quincey stacks his tenth one.

32:26.277 --> 32:29.180
-What do you think?
-JEROME: Let's go, guys.
-ELIZABETH: You got it.

32:29.247 --> 32:31.349
-That's it, looks good, done.
-KEOGHAN: And... done!

32:32.450 --> 32:33.685
-Quincey has the hanger...
-Yes!

32:33.751 --> 32:35.687
...and he's safe from overtime!

32:35.753 --> 32:36.888
(Quincey whoops)

32:36.954 --> 32:38.589
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>Broke my overtime streak.</i>

32:38.656 --> 32:41.326
I'm feeling good.
I can finally breathe.

32:41.392 --> 32:44.395
Here I'm now in the final four,
ready to get the job done.

32:44.462 --> 32:45.663
Ten.

32:45.730 --> 32:46.998
I've been to overtime
and I really don't

32:47.065 --> 32:48.633
want to do it again.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.635
<i>But I'm gonna go out there,</i>
<i>and it's going to be a fight</i>

32:50.702 --> 32:52.870
<i>because I've made it this far,</i>

32:52.937 --> 32:55.139
<i>and I want to be</i>
<i>in the final four.</i>

32:55.206 --> 32:56.140
-(sighs)
-Good job, guys.

32:56.207 --> 32:57.508
QUINCEY:
Boy, that was fun.

32:57.575 --> 32:58.710
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I performed very well</i>

32:58.776 --> 33:00.712
for myself on this challenge.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.380
<i>Fought all the way till the end.</i>

33:02.447 --> 33:04.115
<i>I haven't been in overtime.</i>

33:04.182 --> 33:05.583
Uh, I've been trying
to avoid it.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.619
<i>But I'm gonna fight</i>
<i>tooth and nail to win it.</i>

33:08.686 --> 33:10.254
KEOGHAN:
Guillermo, thank you
for having us here

33:10.321 --> 33:11.689
-at your pallet yard.
-ELIZABETH: Yeah.
Thank you very much.

33:11.756 --> 33:13.057
You ready for this?

33:13.124 --> 33:14.625
All right.

33:19.263 --> 33:21.132
KEOGHAN:
So, Mike and Lia,

33:21.199 --> 33:23.668
you will be fighting it out
for one last spot

33:23.735 --> 33:24.836
in the final four in overtime.

33:24.902 --> 33:26.404
MIKE:
It's gonna be

33:26.471 --> 33:28.039
-David and Goliath.
-David and Goliath.

33:28.106 --> 33:29.307
KEOGHAN:
And you're playing what role?

33:29.374 --> 33:30.641
-The big guy, I guess.
-Yeah, the big guy.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.810
-The big guy.
-We know how that story ends,

33:32.877 --> 33:33.978
but I don't know, I don't think

33:34.045 --> 33:34.979
you're gonna give it up
that easily.

33:35.046 --> 33:36.214
Not that easy.

33:36.280 --> 33:39.951
Today's overtime
is going to be about

33:40.017 --> 33:41.953
keeping your cool,
because each of you

33:42.019 --> 33:44.756
needs to build a rocking chair

33:44.822 --> 33:46.190
just like this one here
that Elizabeth

33:46.257 --> 33:47.859
is sitting in so comfortably.

33:47.925 --> 33:49.594
You've got to make the seat
for your rocking chair.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.029
You can see that the cradle
is already done.

33:52.096 --> 33:55.400
When the work whistle blows,
go and study your work plan.

33:55.466 --> 33:57.535
You need to make six dowels.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.670
You are gonna be making
the dowels by hand,

33:59.737 --> 34:01.005
you have to size them up

34:01.072 --> 34:02.974
<i>using this die right here.</i>

34:03.040 --> 34:05.543
It's about precision,
because if you hit too hard,

34:05.610 --> 34:06.944
you split the wood.

34:07.011 --> 34:09.280
You want to use your dowels
to join the seat together

34:09.347 --> 34:11.549
so you can build your chair.

34:11.616 --> 34:13.584
The first of you to get
your rocking chair completed

34:13.651 --> 34:16.053
will be in our final four,

34:16.120 --> 34:18.156
stay in contention
for that<i> Tough As Nails</i> title.

34:18.222 --> 34:22.160
If you finish last today?
You will be punching out.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.328
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I've never built</i>
<i>furniture before,</i>

34:24.395 --> 34:26.063
<i>but, you know,</i>
<i>I love the pressure.</i>

34:26.130 --> 34:27.799
<i>That's what my job</i>
<i>gives me every day.</i>

34:27.865 --> 34:30.568
<i>It's life or death when</i>
<i>you're working on the line,</i>

34:30.635 --> 34:32.570
<i>so you have to have</i>
<i>that mental sharpness.</i>

34:32.637 --> 34:34.305
Okay, let's get to work.
Mike, you'll be here.

34:34.372 --> 34:35.840
Lia, you'll be working
over there.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.408
-(applause)
-KELSY: Yeah, guys.

34:37.475 --> 34:39.444
<i>LIA:</i>
<i>First thing about Mike</i>
<i>you notice is,</i>

34:39.510 --> 34:42.246
<i>"He's a big guy,</i>
<i>and he's powerful."</i>

34:42.313 --> 34:45.850
<i>When people first see me, thy</i>
<i>see someone kind of average.</i>

34:45.917 --> 34:48.619
I'm five-foot-three,
120-some pounds.

34:48.686 --> 34:50.721
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>about me that says</i>

34:50.788 --> 34:52.657
I'm super-duper capable.

34:52.723 --> 34:55.526
<i>But you can't judge a book</i>
<i>by its cover, honestly.</i>

34:55.593 --> 34:57.528
On the work whistle.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.697
Let's go, guys.

34:59.764 --> 35:00.865
(work whistle blows)

35:00.932 --> 35:02.900
-KELSY: Come on.
-JEROME: Okay, let's go.

35:02.967 --> 35:04.302
(applause)

35:04.368 --> 35:05.770
(whoops)

35:08.105 --> 35:10.107
<i>LIA:</i>
<i>Mike and I are given</i>
<i>a bunch of wooden pieces</i>

35:10.174 --> 35:11.642
<i>that we have to assemble,</i>

35:11.709 --> 35:14.011
using dowels which are not
the right size.

35:14.078 --> 35:15.780
<i>So we have to take</i>
<i>the dowels down</i>

35:15.847 --> 35:17.315
<i>to the right size</i>
<i>to assemble together</i>

35:17.381 --> 35:19.116
<i>and make a rocker chair.</i>

35:19.183 --> 35:21.385
SARAH:
Let's go, Mike. Come on.

35:21.452 --> 35:22.520
-Focus, Mike. Focus.
-Yes.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.755
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>My strategy is gonna be</i>

35:24.822 --> 35:27.992
thinking of, uh,
doing Legos with my son Landon.

35:28.059 --> 35:31.729
<i>You see the picture and you lay</i>
<i>out exactly the pieces you need.</i>

35:34.732 --> 35:35.900
Good job, guys.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.768
KEOGHAN:
Lia gets through
her first dowel.

35:37.835 --> 35:39.103
CHRISTINE:
Nice job, Lia.

35:40.137 --> 35:41.739
KELSY:
Did he just cut himself?

35:41.806 --> 35:43.774
Oh, my gosh, he did.
Be careful, Mike.

35:43.841 --> 35:45.309
CHRISTINE:
Watch your fingers.

35:45.376 --> 35:46.744
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I think I cut myself</i>

35:46.811 --> 35:48.579
on the box cutter.

35:48.646 --> 35:51.148
<i>I was trying to move</i>
<i>my dowel out of the way,</i>

35:51.215 --> 35:52.149
and it caught me.

35:52.216 --> 35:53.351
KELSY:
Mike's bleeding.

35:53.417 --> 35:54.519
KEOGHAN:
Mike, you all right?

35:54.585 --> 35:55.953
MIKE:
Yeah, I'll keep going.

35:56.020 --> 35:58.022
And then, as soon
as I start hammering

35:58.089 --> 35:59.390
the-the first dowel,

35:59.457 --> 36:01.759
<i>uh, blood just started</i>
<i>going everywhere.</i>

36:01.826 --> 36:04.629
And I was just like,
"This is gonna suck,"

36:04.695 --> 36:06.130
<i>but you got to just</i>
<i>push through it.</i>

36:08.299 --> 36:09.634
CHRISTINE:
Good job, Lia.

36:09.700 --> 36:10.835
Good job, Mike.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.837
<i>LIA:</i>
<i>We have a hammer,</i>

36:12.904 --> 36:16.541
<i>a little template</i>
<i>to slam the dowels down</i>

36:16.607 --> 36:18.543
<i>and size them.</i>

36:18.609 --> 36:20.745
It's time-consuming and...

36:20.811 --> 36:23.080
<i>not just easy to make a dowel.</i>

36:23.147 --> 36:24.115
KEOGHAN:
Mike is keeping ahold

36:24.181 --> 36:26.150
of his dowel as he works.

36:26.217 --> 36:27.952
That helps to keep
his dowel steady.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.454
Lia hitting at different speeds.

36:30.521 --> 36:31.722
-LIA: Oh, son of a gun.

-Come on, Mike.
-Nice job, Lia.

36:54.845 --> 36:55.913
Oh, no.

36:55.980 --> 36:56.914

<i>LIA:</i>
<i>Snapping dowels,</i>

<i>having to start over again,</i>

And I had no strategy
whatsoever.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.322
I'm winging it.

<i>And then it dawns on me</i>

37:06.223 --> 37:07.658
<i>that I have a little step,</i>

<i>so that I can get</i>

<i>LIA:</i>
<i>I can get straight above it,</i>

to get the job done.

from the bottom.

that's happening to me

38:58.736 --> 38:59.837
could happen to Mike,

38:59.904 --> 39:01.038
<i>so I just-- you can't stop.</i>

39:01.105 --> 39:03.474
KEOGHAN:
Beautiful work. Look at that.

39:03.541 --> 39:05.443
-Straight, straight, straight.
-That's nice work, Lia.

39:05.509 --> 39:09.380
Both Mike and Lia working
on their sixth and final dowel.

39:09.447 --> 39:10.715
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>My forearms were burning,</i>

39:10.781 --> 39:12.283
going through,
hitting those dowels,

39:12.349 --> 39:14.385
<i>and I was like, "Whatever,</i>
<i>just keep going, Mike,</i>

39:14.452 --> 39:15.586
<i>just keep going."</i>

39:16.887 --> 39:18.289
Oh...

39:18.355 --> 39:19.657
Mike has a break.

39:19.724 --> 39:21.392
Now he's got to make
another dowel from scratch.

39:21.459 --> 39:22.693
That's a disaster.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.529
Lia's now looking to get
this sixth dowel in.

39:25.596 --> 39:28.766
Mike and Lia fighting it out
to stay in the final four.

39:28.833 --> 39:31.135
There you go.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.237
-Come on, Mike.
-KEOGHAN:
There's a little bit of dowel

39:33.304 --> 39:34.305
left at the top.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.142
Lia's cutting
off her sixth dowel.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.910
Got to be nice and flush,
all six of them.

39:39.977 --> 39:41.078
She's checking.

39:41.145 --> 39:42.780
All right.

39:42.847 --> 39:45.282
LIA:
Excuse me, Phil.

39:47.551 --> 39:50.354
KEOGHAN:
And Lia gets
into the rocking chair.

39:50.421 --> 39:51.589
-(applause)
-(exhales)

39:51.655 --> 39:54.492
Taking the win and going
into the final four.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.494
Now let me in here,
let me in here.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.162
<i>I just love competing.</i>

39:58.229 --> 40:00.264
Everybody here has
such a great heart,

40:00.331 --> 40:03.167
<i>and it's so much fun to push</i>
<i>ourselves against each other.</i>

40:03.234 --> 40:06.337
I had no idea which one of us
was-was gonna sit

40:06.403 --> 40:07.872
in that rocking chair first.

40:07.938 --> 40:09.540
-Lia, you're a beast.
-Thanks.

40:09.607 --> 40:10.741
-Good job.
-Thanks, brother.

40:10.808 --> 40:12.109
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Today was a tough day.</i>

40:12.176 --> 40:13.611
<i>I came here to win and to be</i>

40:13.677 --> 40:15.613
<i>the next</i> Tough As Nails
<i>champion.</i>

40:15.679 --> 40:18.315
<i>So taking a loss</i>
<i>was heartbreaking for me.</i>

40:18.382 --> 40:20.284
<i>But Lia's a great competitor.</i>

40:20.351 --> 40:23.420
Her being the one able
to pick Dirty Hands

40:23.487 --> 40:25.956
and me being able
to pick Savage Crew,

40:26.023 --> 40:27.992
<i>we kind of grew a bond together.</i>

40:28.058 --> 40:30.027
<i>And I have so much respect</i>
<i>for her.</i>

40:30.094 --> 40:32.963
I mean, my family just grew
bigger now, and, you know,

40:33.030 --> 40:35.766
I-I love it and I wouldn't
change anything for the world.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.368
Lia, congratulations
for making it

40:37.434 --> 40:38.836
through to the final four.

40:38.903 --> 40:40.004
-You deserve it.
-MIKE: Yes.

40:40.070 --> 40:42.006
Coming here opened

40:42.072 --> 40:45.276
my eyes up to women
that are in the trades,

40:45.342 --> 40:47.745
because, back home,
I don't see that.

40:47.812 --> 40:52.049
And to see Lia,
Elizabeth, Kelsy,

40:52.116 --> 40:55.085
Sarah, Christine,
Kalimba in these trades

40:55.152 --> 40:56.554
normally you see men in

40:56.620 --> 41:00.324
is a huge thing,
'cause now my little girl Sicily

41:00.391 --> 41:02.059
can see you guys work hard.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.761
-(applause)
-HANGER: That's right,
that's right.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.729
MIKE:
These women are strong,

41:05.796 --> 41:07.431
and I hope my daughter can be

41:07.498 --> 41:10.334
just as-as strong as them,
and I want her to.

41:10.401 --> 41:11.602
Your daughter's
gonna be amazing.

41:11.669 --> 41:14.171
-Thank you. Thanks.
-She's got a good dad.

41:15.206 --> 41:16.340
KEOGHAN:
Mike, unfortunately,

41:16.407 --> 41:18.275
-after your journey...
-Yes.

41:18.342 --> 41:19.810
...all the way through
to the final five,

41:19.877 --> 41:22.413
-I do need to ask you
to punch out.
-Yes, sir.

41:22.479 --> 41:25.616
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I feel blessed that I had</i>
<i>the opportunity to compete,</i>

41:25.683 --> 41:28.419
and it's not always
all about the money.

41:35.559 --> 41:38.495
<i>It's about coming together</i>
<i>and having these memories</i>

41:38.562 --> 41:41.832
<i>and understanding of each other</i>
<i>so we can bring it</i>

41:41.899 --> 41:44.235
back home and understand
ourselves even better.

41:44.301 --> 41:45.502
Lia, congratulations.

41:45.569 --> 41:47.338
You've made it through
to the final four.

Along with Elizabeth,
Quincey and Jerome.

41:49.573 --> 41:51.508
This is gonna be
a hard-fought battle.

41:51.575 --> 41:54.245
Tomorrow one of you
will be crowned
