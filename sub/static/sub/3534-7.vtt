00:36.345 --> 00:37.512
Whoo!

01:03.205 --> 01:04.657
Hey, beautiful!

01:05.242 --> 01:06.488
Are you talking to me?

01:06.761 --> 01:09.081
No, I'm talking to your friend,
uh, Jon Lovitz over here.

01:09.326 --> 01:11.496
Fuck, yes, I'm talking to you.
What's happening?

01:11.530 --> 01:12.223
Asshole.

01:12.343 --> 01:16.102
Oh, come on, don't call me an asshole.
They sell sunscreen to everybody.

01:16.136 --> 01:18.539
I got a question for
you. And that is...

01:18.574 --> 01:21.142
Why am I so damn hot in here?

01:21.177 --> 01:23.011
Yeah, what you know
about money, girl?

01:23.046 --> 01:25.314
What you know
about money, girl?

01:25.348 --> 01:27.450
We should go.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:27.484 --> 01:29.452
Okay, ladies, let me just
break it down for you, okay?

01:29.487 --> 01:31.288
Before you make yourselves
look any stupider.

01:31.323 --> 01:33.424
I'm a closing pitcher
for Texas, girl.

01:33.458 --> 01:36.561
And I close in more ways,
than just on the mound.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.197
Well, that's good news,
cause I don't date athletes.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.033
Oh, not yet you don't.

01:41.068 --> 01:43.269
Right? First time
for everything, huh?

01:47.242 --> 01:49.310
Go on. Go, go.

01:54.217 --> 01:57.453
Hey, hey, slow down.
Wait up. Look, hey, uh...

01:57.487 --> 02:00.790
I'm drunk, okay, and I'm, uh...

02:00.824 --> 02:04.194
I was, I was acting like a jerk, and
that's, that's not me. I mean...

02:04.228 --> 02:09.733
I mean, it is me, I'm a baseball player,
but I'm not a dumb jock, and I...

02:09.768 --> 02:12.102
Look, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that stuff.

02:12.137 --> 02:15.339
I was rely nervous, and...

02:15.373 --> 02:17.441
It's because...

02:19.110 --> 02:20.210
I like you.

02:24.350 --> 02:26.451
Okay?

02:28.221 --> 02:31.224
Oh my God! Shit.

02:33.928 --> 02:35.963
Aw, aw...
Oh, shit, no, no.

02:35.997 --> 02:37.731
Somebody call an ambulance.

02:37.766 --> 02:42.437
What are we gonna do? We
got playoffs, B. Playoffs!

02:42.471 --> 02:45.340
I'm fine...

03:23.383 --> 03:27.253
Hey, you. It's kinda quiet without,
uh, little dude here. Huh?

03:27.287 --> 03:30.056
It's fucking awesome.
Finally shit's back to normal.

03:30.090 --> 03:32.958
I'm once again a single
thick-dick swinging bachelor,

03:32.993 --> 03:35.828
no dumb baggage to
fucking carry me down.

03:35.862 --> 03:39.799
Thank you, Christ, for allowing
all this awesome stuff to happen.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.434
Hey, Kenny, you know,
I was thinking...

03:41.468 --> 03:43.502
If you want, Maria and I
could do some redecorating.

03:43.504 --> 03:46.906
Maybe swap out some of these hot
babes for some new hot babes.

03:46.940 --> 03:51.277
That way when Toby comes back to visit,
he's got some new shit to get baby hard to.

03:51.311 --> 03:52.812
I wouldn't hold
your breath on that.

03:52.846 --> 03:54.280
The kid's gone.

03:54.314 --> 03:56.582
The sooner we accept
that, the better we'll be.

03:56.616 --> 03:58.517
As soon as we get this nursery
changed back into my dojo,

03:58.552 --> 04:00.319
I can get my shit
fucking ripped again.

04:00.353 --> 04:02.521
Okay, aye, aye, Captain.

04:03.590 --> 04:05.991
What the fuck is that?

04:06.025 --> 04:08.726
Fuck.

04:08.761 --> 04:11.595
Holy shit.
It's Spurgen, the hermit crab.

04:11.630 --> 04:13.564
He lives in a fucking bowl?

04:13.598 --> 04:16.531
He must be getting
high as fuck!

04:16.567 --> 04:19.000
Goddamnit. Now I gotta figure out
what to do with this dumb thing.

04:19.035 --> 04:23.338
If I were you, I would smash the
fuck out of that crab with a hammer.

04:23.372 --> 04:25.040
No.
No, no. We...

04:25.074 --> 04:26.341
This is Toby's favorite
pet. He probably misses him.

04:26.376 --> 04:28.577
Maria, feed this fucking crab.

04:28.611 --> 04:29.811
Okay.

04:31.381 --> 04:33.782
- Love you!
- Love you, too.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.484
Seems like you guys
are happy again.

04:35.518 --> 04:37.620
Mmm-hmm, this
is awesome!

04:38.221 --> 04:39.188
Awesome.

04:44.628 --> 04:48.398
Peek-a-boo. Just kidding.
Psyche your mind, it's me.

04:48.432 --> 04:50.534
You wanted to see me?

04:50.568 --> 04:52.436
What do
you want to do?

04:52.470 --> 04:55.807
Offer your franchise star player
a blowjob, slash, hand job...

04:55.841 --> 04:58.009
For saving your stinky ass.

04:58.044 --> 04:59.444
Star player...

04:59.479 --> 05:02.514
That's exactly what I
wanted talk to you about.

05:02.548 --> 05:07.586
You are no longer
the star player of the Mermen.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.420
Come on, man. What the fuck
are you talking about, dude?

05:09.455 --> 05:11.622
After I just saved your
asses at the game...

05:11.657 --> 05:13.424
You don't even play
for the team anymore.

05:13.458 --> 05:15.192
What the fuck are
you talking about?

05:16.295 --> 05:18.162
Because you're
playing for Texas.

05:20.699 --> 05:22.566
What?

05:22.600 --> 05:24.101
You're getting
called up, Kenny.

05:27.305 --> 05:28.805
You gotta be shitting me.

05:32.409 --> 05:34.310
I mean, finally, motherfuckers.

05:34.344 --> 05:36.278
I knew this was gonna happen.

05:36.312 --> 05:38.013
I just can't believe it took these
dudes this long to figure it out.

05:38.047 --> 05:39.481
Jesus Christ.

05:39.515 --> 05:42.116
Their closer got
hit by a truck.

05:42.151 --> 05:46.354
Now that Ivan fucking sucks,
I'm the logical choice. Ha.

05:46.389 --> 05:51.927
I've been wanting to kick your old, worthless
ass off my team for such a long time.

05:51.961 --> 05:55.331
Well, I look forward to never seeing
your wrinkly fucking face again, either.

05:55.365 --> 05:57.233
Fuck you, you
fat, fucking honky.

05:57.267 --> 06:00.603
And fuck you too,
you black dick licker.

06:02.473 --> 06:03.640
You shit's licker!

06:03.674 --> 06:05.341
Fuck you!

06:05.376 --> 06:07.210
Oh, fuck you and your Mama too!

06:07.244 --> 06:08.445
I hope you get AIDS.

06:08.479 --> 06:11.048
Bye, bye, motherfucker!

06:11.082 --> 06:14.051
These vessels follow the same
course as your harmonious arteries.

06:14.086 --> 06:15.953
But they return the blood
into two different systems...

06:15.988 --> 06:17.955
Everybody be cool, this
isn't a school shooting!

06:17.990 --> 06:19.925
It's something
far more fantastic.

06:19.959 --> 06:21.426
Sir?
Sir, yourself.

06:21.460 --> 06:23.194
Where's Andrea?

06:23.228 --> 06:26.030
You can't keep storming into my classrooms.
We're broken up.

06:26.064 --> 06:30.134
What? No, no, no, no.
That breakup wasn't real.

06:30.168 --> 06:34.371
Sure, You betrayed me and my party,
but that breakup was spoken in anger.

06:34.405 --> 06:36.340
And, I'm sorry for
that. It didn't count.

06:36.374 --> 06:37.941
It didn't?

06:37.975 --> 06:40.510
No, this is the
breakup that counts.

06:41.980 --> 06:43.280
You're an asshole.

06:43.314 --> 06:45.515
Easy, let's not
get bitter, okay?

06:45.549 --> 06:47.817
I know a lot of you guys
are looking at me and saying,

06:47.852 --> 06:51.787
"Hey, there's a dude who
is exactly my same age."

06:51.821 --> 06:55.423
Well, truth be told. I'm
a grown-up, real person.

06:55.457 --> 06:58.960
Sure your bodies might be tight.
You might like to have sex in amazing,

06:58.994 --> 07:01.896
cool, intricate positions.
But besides that shit...

07:01.930 --> 07:04.131
all don't have a fucking clue.

07:04.166 --> 07:08.770
The shit y'all are doing. The fucking Facebook
shit, the Internets, the fucking DVDS.

07:08.804 --> 07:12.107
That's all bullshit.
Your shit isn't real.

07:12.141 --> 07:17.913
But from where I'm standing, a full
grown man, who has achieved his dreams.

07:17.948 --> 07:21.050
Yeah, that's right. I'm
going back to the majors.

07:21.085 --> 07:23.519
My shit is about
as real as it gets.

07:23.554 --> 07:26.989
And besides, I can
out-party, out-drink,

07:27.023 --> 07:29.825
and out-fuck,
each of you.

07:29.859 --> 07:33.362
Youth can suck my dick.

07:33.396 --> 07:39.268
So unless you have anything to add.
Then consider this relationship over.

07:39.302 --> 07:43.104
Have a nice life.
I'll never forget you.

07:43.139 --> 07:45.740
And I know you won't forget me.

07:45.775 --> 07:50.345
Cause I popped that cherry.
That's right, I tore it out for all you young guys.

08:14.371 --> 08:16.873
Saying good-bye to
you, is gonna hurt.

08:16.907 --> 08:19.942
I ripped up a lot of fucking awesome
waves on this boogie board.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.411
Basically owned
this goddamn beach.

08:22.446 --> 08:24.247
<i>Adios,</i> friend.

08:25.782 --> 08:27.450
We had a good time
here in Myrtle.

08:27.484 --> 08:31.821
But, now it is time to say
goodbye to your glorious shores.

08:31.856 --> 08:34.224
So crazy that this is the end.

08:34.258 --> 08:37.727
It's not a bad thing, though, Stevie.
Don't be all sad and fucking melancholy. It's...

08:37.760 --> 08:39.796
Maria, you must be pretty
happy though, huh?

08:39.830 --> 08:42.865
Texas has a fucking weather
climate very similar to Mexico...

08:42.900 --> 08:44.967
Except it doesn't stink like
fucking buttholes and donkeys.

08:49.038 --> 08:52.140
Hey, don't think I just didn't catch that
fucking non-verbal loaded exchange, there.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.409
Permission to speak
freely, Kenny?

08:56.345 --> 08:57.745
Permission granted.

08:57.779 --> 08:59.446
You know how you
always say we're like...

08:59.481 --> 09:03.550
Astronauts, or lead guitarists,
and we're not cut out for family.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.319
I said that about
myself, but continue.

09:06.354 --> 09:09.890
Okay, well. I'm just
starting to think like...

09:09.924 --> 09:15.462
Maybe I am one of those pussies
that does like family.

09:15.496 --> 09:17.030
What the hell are
you saying, Stevie?

09:18.533 --> 09:23.337
Kenny, Maria is pregnant.

09:23.371 --> 09:26.374
How can you tell, man?
I mean, she always looks like she's pregnant.

09:26.408 --> 09:32.180
She pissed on one of those sticks.
I held it under her pussy myself. It's legit, man.

09:32.214 --> 09:35.250
Well, what the fuck, dude? We're gonna have
to go and investigate some options, now.

09:35.284 --> 09:37.319
Maybe an abortion clinic, dude.

09:37.354 --> 09:40.022
The last thing we need in Texas, is
another goddamn baby dragging us down.

09:40.057 --> 09:42.758
Did you not learn anything
from our time from Toby?

09:42.792 --> 09:45.593
Kenny. That's what I wanted
to talk to you about...

09:47.563 --> 09:49.964
We're not going
to Texas with you.

09:49.998 --> 09:55.268
We're going to stay here and we're gonna
build a life together, in Myrtle.

09:59.907 --> 10:01.540
Stevie, have you
thought this through?

10:01.574 --> 10:03.108
I mean, you're really
willing to forgo...

10:03.143 --> 10:05.611
All the status that'll come
with being my associate?

10:05.645 --> 10:07.480
Give up your possible
fucking co-starring role,

10:07.514 --> 10:10.082
in the reality series
I'm developing? Huh?

10:13.988 --> 10:15.488
Yes.

10:15.522 --> 10:18.424
What? You're, you're
thinking about it?

10:18.459 --> 10:21.427
I've thought about it.
Kenny, we're staying in Myrtle.

10:26.834 --> 10:31.370
Well, I suppose if you're gonna
do that, you're gonna need this.

10:35.942 --> 10:37.442
What is this?

10:38.811 --> 10:41.012
It's the keys to
the Panty Dropper.

10:41.047 --> 10:43.248
If you're gonna stay in
Myrtle, and become a man,

10:43.282 --> 10:46.652
then you're sure as hell, gonna need
a man's water recreational vehicle.

10:46.686 --> 10:48.354
I don't know
what to say.

10:48.388 --> 10:52.525
I do. Steven
Bernard Janowski.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.329
You are hereby relieved of
your duties as my assistant.

10:55.363 --> 10:58.866
You have served
me well, hombre.

10:58.901 --> 11:02.737
And I give you the right to name your
child after me. Regardless of gender.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.440
<i>Gracias.</i>
<i>For real?</i>

11:05.475 --> 11:07.075
For reals, dog.

11:07.110 --> 11:10.646
Come here, you two.
Come here. Come here.

11:21.291 --> 11:23.059
It's a special moment, guys.

11:43.182 --> 11:46.917
Kenny. I wasn't expecting
to see you again.

11:46.952 --> 11:50.454
Yeah, well, surprise, surprise.
How's it feel to have your mind blown?

11:52.490 --> 11:55.825
I'm moving to Texas. Got
called up to the Majors, so...

11:55.859 --> 11:58.994
Gonna go live a life of being
much richer and famouser.

11:59.029 --> 12:01.129
So you really got called up?

12:01.164 --> 12:05.134
Yup. I put in the hard work,
and did all the shit, and...

12:05.168 --> 12:08.337
I beat this Russian.
And I earned my spot.

12:08.371 --> 12:10.372
Congratulations.

12:10.407 --> 12:12.375
I just stopped by
actually because...

12:12.409 --> 12:15.145
I found something that I think
Toby's probably gonna want.

12:17.949 --> 12:20.184
A marijuana pipe?

12:20.218 --> 12:22.486
Well, technically I use
this pipe to smoke DMT.

12:22.521 --> 12:25.489
But, now it's the
home to Spurgen.

12:26.624 --> 12:29.125
His hermit crab.
It's a pet.

12:29.160 --> 12:32.595
Is it cool if I enter your domicile
to return to him his property?

12:32.629 --> 12:34.163
Come on in.

12:36.183 --> 12:38.132
Hey... What's up,
you little jerk?

12:39.335 --> 12:40.738
l got something for ya.

12:40.858 --> 12:45.207
It's Spurgen. It's your pet
hermit crab. You remember him?

12:47.277 --> 12:50.781
Also wanted to have a man-to-man
talk with you, if that was cool.

12:52.450 --> 12:54.618
Due to some recent events...

12:54.653 --> 12:57.922
I don't think I'm going to be
able to be around you, as...

12:57.957 --> 13:01.493
As much as I have been
in the past few weeks.

13:01.528 --> 13:04.396
I've got an incredible
job opportunity.

13:04.431 --> 13:09.701
That is going to force me to relocate
to a much dryer, more arid climate.

13:11.403 --> 13:15.305
But I hope that you know
that, while I'm gone...

13:15.340 --> 13:21.011
All the wealth that I will acquire.
All the fame, and fortunes...

13:21.045 --> 13:23.413
And all the women
that I will bed.

13:23.447 --> 13:27.584
I will be doing all that stuff,
so that you'll be proud of me.

13:29.187 --> 13:31.122
So that you can be
proud of your dad.

13:33.558 --> 13:35.025
Kenny...

13:37.395 --> 13:40.965
Just wanna thank
you for coming by.

13:42.134 --> 13:44.335
When you left me...

13:44.370 --> 13:49.175
When we were gonna go
to Tampa. It hurt a lot.

13:50.978 --> 13:54.448
And I know when I left
you, it hurt you too.

13:55.583 --> 13:57.518
And I just wanna
say, I'm sorry.

13:59.388 --> 14:02.056
I didn't just come
back for Toby.

14:04.226 --> 14:09.997
I mean, I did, but I also
came back for you, too.

14:16.169 --> 14:19.672
Well, your timing kinda sucks.
I'm getting ready to move to Texas and shit.

14:20.674 --> 14:22.074
Right.

14:23.343 --> 14:26.679
Not gonna really...
Not gonna be around.

14:31.619 --> 14:33.153
I'm gonna go.

14:34.556 --> 14:36.156
See ya, Toby.

14:39.461 --> 14:41.029
<i>Adios,</i> April.

15:37.985 --> 15:40.020
How you doing, Kenny?

15:40.054 --> 15:41.855
Yeah, I'm doing good.

15:41.889 --> 15:43.824
Well, there's no
time for a pep talk.

15:43.858 --> 15:48.463
But, I would like to take a knee
here with you and, say a prayer.

15:48.497 --> 15:50.431
Will you pray with me?

15:50.466 --> 15:52.467
To, to Jesus?
Yes, sir.

15:53.302 --> 15:55.537
Okay, yeah.

15:55.571 --> 15:59.675
Dear Jesus, we come
to you with gratitude...

15:59.710 --> 16:03.513
On this evening, with thanks
for shepherding this man,

16:03.547 --> 16:06.349
Kenny Powers, to a
personal victory.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.751
The fact that we sit here, now,
with you Lord, in this clubhouse.

16:10.154 --> 16:15.224
Is proof that Kenneth
Powers has successfully...

16:15.258 --> 16:17.659
Sucked his dream's dick, Lord.

16:17.693 --> 16:19.060
Thank you, Jesus.

16:19.095 --> 16:20.995
Thank you, Jesus, for that.

16:21.030 --> 16:23.965
Kenny sucked, and he stroked.

16:23.999 --> 16:26.602
Kenny learned how to breathe
through his nose while doin' it.

16:26.636 --> 16:30.539
Kenny found a free finger
to touch ass along the way.

16:30.574 --> 16:32.508
And that took commitment, Lord.

16:32.543 --> 16:37.882
But, you, and I, and Kenneth know
that there is much more to come.

16:37.916 --> 16:39.317
The finish
line, Jesus.

16:39.384 --> 16:41.152
Hallelujah!

16:41.186 --> 16:44.322
Give him strength of fist
to stay among the stroke.

16:44.356 --> 16:48.960
That you relax his throat, to, to
embrace this bulging opportunity.

16:48.994 --> 16:50.128
Give me strength,
fucking Jesus.

16:50.162 --> 16:52.430
Give him his strength,
Lord Jesus.

16:52.464 --> 16:54.265
Endless strength,
fucking Jesus.

16:54.299 --> 16:56.300
He's gonna bring the
fortified ejaculation.

16:56.335 --> 16:58.336
Mmm!

16:58.370 --> 17:02.139
Tonight, for the first time, in his own
public demonstration in front of you!

17:02.173 --> 17:04.208
And the world, Jesus.

17:04.242 --> 17:06.077
Super chill, Jesus Christ.

17:06.746 --> 17:08.445
It's cum time.

17:10.183 --> 17:12.685
And it's up to you, Kenny.

17:14.054 --> 17:15.121
Spit

17:16.589 --> 17:17.790
or swallow?

17:19.594 --> 17:21.662
You know the answer...

17:25.300 --> 17:27.435
Thank you,
Jesus. Amen.

17:27.469 --> 17:29.170
Fuck yeah,
Jesus. Amen.

17:32.207 --> 17:33.407
Take it down.

18:05.871 --> 18:08.173
Kenny! Kenny!

18:08.207 --> 18:11.076
All right, baby, one's the fucking
fastball, two's the curve ball.

18:11.111 --> 18:13.178
You got it. Let's
do it. Let's go.

19:02.265 --> 19:04.032
Strike!

19:37.198 --> 19:39.932
<i>That was the moment
I realized I had finally achieved...</i>

19:39.967 --> 19:42.868
<i>Everything I worked</i>
<i>so hard for.</i>

19:42.903 --> 19:47.240
<i>Despite the countless obstacles and
adversities I faced along the way.</i>

19:47.274 --> 19:50.309
<i>It was that exact moment, when I
looked into that batter's eyes...</i>

19:50.344 --> 19:53.814
<i>And I saw stone cold,</i>
<i>child-like fear.</i>

19:53.848 --> 19:58.852
<i>For the first time in so many moons,
I felt I was in total control.</i>

19:58.886 --> 20:03.390
<i>I held my own destiny in my hands,
as sure as I held that baseball.</i>

20:03.425 --> 20:08.529
<i>My future, everything, comes</i>
<i>down to one final pitch.</i>

20:40.899 --> 20:43.200
What the fuck? What
the fuck, Kenny?

20:50.841 --> 20:52.642
Where the fuck are you going?

20:52.676 --> 20:54.143
Home, motherfucker.

20:57.847 --> 20:59.515
I'm in a fucking
Cameron Crowe movie!

20:59.549 --> 21:01.483
Whoo!

21:03.586 --> 21:07.589
Holy shit!
Holy shit!

21:07.623 --> 21:10.192
Whoo! Fuck me!

21:19.503 --> 21:21.470
Whoo, they gonna be pissed.

22:37.749 --> 22:42.754
<i>One of baseball's greats, Kenny Powers,
has perished in a horrific car accident.</i>

22:42.788 --> 22:45.756
<i>A pitching phenomenon
and a controversial figure...</i>

22:45.791 --> 22:47.926
<i>The moments
directly following a comeback,</i>

22:47.960 --> 22:50.128
<i>are hands fucking down</i>
<i>the sweetest part.</i>

22:52.999 --> 22:57.602
<i>When everybody you've ever known, the whole
world in fact, celebrates your success.</i>

23:02.642 --> 23:05.143
<i>Everyone gets some.</i>

23:05.177 --> 23:08.446
<i>The little people who acted as stepping
stones on your path to success...</i>

23:11.851 --> 23:14.352
<i>They can brag to their children
about how they aided you.</i>

23:18.858 --> 23:22.427
<i>Even if it was only in some</i>
<i>stupid, insignificant way.</i>

23:28.968 --> 23:31.136
<i>Even the enemies you've</i>
<i>made along the way...</i>

23:34.106 --> 23:36.341
<i>They have to begrudge the fact that
you've shoved their jealousness,</i>

23:36.376 --> 23:38.110
<i>lack of faith, and spite...</i>

23:39.846 --> 23:42.180
<i>Right back in their</i>
<i>fucking hater faces.</i>

23:54.193 --> 23:57.462
<i>But I imagine it's probably sweetest
for those that truly believed in you.</i>

24:01.267 --> 24:04.035
<i>Those that stood by you</i>
<i>through the good times...</i>

24:08.574 --> 24:10.374
<i>And the not so good times.</i>

24:20.216 --> 24:22.818
<i>Standing by a champion</i>
<i>is a feat unto itself.</i>

24:22.852 --> 24:25.220
<i>I mean, it's not as much work
as actually doing the comeback,</i>

24:27.089 --> 24:29.123
<i>but it still should</i>
<i>count for something.</i>

24:41.703 --> 24:44.438
<i>I hope this inspirational novel story
helps to give you inspiration,</i>

24:44.473 --> 24:46.808
<i>in your attempts to stop being</i>
<i>a regular, normal person.</i>

24:46.842 --> 24:49.511
<i>And to start being</i>
<i>a champion instead.</i>

24:49.545 --> 24:52.081
<i>Dreams and riches do come</i>
<i>true for some people.</i>

24:52.115 --> 24:56.519
<i>Take it from me,</i>
<i>Kenny Powers. I'm out.</i>

24:56.554 --> 24:59.189
<i>The end...of the book.</i>

25:09.199 --> 25:12.702
I cannot find my phone.
I think I left in my purse.

25:27.516 --> 25:29.183
Big Cannons.

25:35.590 --> 25:37.691
What in the fuck?

25:39.027 --> 25:40.394
I'm alive.

25:42.464 --> 25:46.900
I... I can
see that.

25:46.935 --> 25:49.303
The news said...
I know what the news said.

25:49.337 --> 25:51.104
I'm sorry.

25:51.139 --> 25:54.007
I would've been here sooner, but
I had to get my truck back.

25:54.041 --> 25:58.043
Kenny, what is going on?
Your hair is bleached.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.846
I know, it's to conceal
me. Now, just calm down.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.981
Hear what I have to say.

26:03.016 --> 26:05.317
When I came back from Mexico
I made you a promise...

26:05.352 --> 26:08.921
That I would do whatever it
takes, to make this thing work.

26:08.956 --> 26:11.823
And I failed you
on that promise.

26:11.858 --> 26:17.030
I was hypnotized by my vast
fame and my immense power.

26:17.064 --> 26:20.267
My incredible ego had
gotten the better of me.

26:20.301 --> 26:23.938
I used to think that the only
way to live was by winning...

26:23.972 --> 26:28.409
And now I realize that,
sometimes, losing is cool too.

26:28.444 --> 26:30.111
How do you mean?

26:30.145 --> 26:31.813
Well, like, having a family.

26:31.847 --> 26:33.915
I mean, not that having
a family is losing.

26:33.949 --> 26:38.053
I mean, it's winning, kind
of, but you know what...

26:38.087 --> 26:41.924
The bottom line, I want to
be there for you, April.

26:41.958 --> 26:46.329
I want to be there for Toby.
I want to be there for our fucking family.

26:47.831 --> 26:51.000
Kenny, everybody
thinks you're dead.

26:51.035 --> 26:54.104
I know. This was
the only way.

26:54.139 --> 26:56.440
The press would have
never left us alone.

26:56.475 --> 26:58.143
Really?

26:58.177 --> 27:00.545
Mmm-hmm.

27:00.579 --> 27:03.282
You couldn't have just stayed in the majors
and me and Toby could have come with you?

27:06.886 --> 27:10.388
Uh-uh. Just... No,
I don't think that...

27:10.423 --> 27:12.490
I don't think that
would've worked.

27:12.524 --> 27:15.793
I'm pretty sure this is the
right choice for our family.

27:24.301 --> 27:26.736
Come inside, you
son of a bitch.
