WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:04.922
Counter-Strike, Hyper Scape, Call of Duty.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.549
What do these mega-franchises
have in common?

00:10.344 --> 00:13.180
-Battle royale.
-No.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.348
Absolutely not.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.891
What's wrong with battle royale?

00:15.974 --> 00:17.976
Nothing.
It's a last-man-standing survival mode

00:18.060 --> 00:19.978
that everyone's
doing a version of these days.

00:20.062 --> 00:23.398
They're doing it because it's the cheapest
way to get the youngest players possible.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.401
-It's a fad. It will not work in our game.
-Then make it work.

00:26.485 --> 00:29.321
It's a big, fat whale carcass
just sitting on a beach.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.990
We should be gorging on it
like the other seagulls.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.659
Well, I'm not a seagull.

00:34.243 --> 00:36.870
-Not yet, you're not.
-Not yet? What is that supposed to mean?

00:36.954 --> 00:38.664
I'm just gonna turn into a bird?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.415
Can we please focus on the expansion?

00:40.499 --> 00:42.709
We have the stage-gate meeting
with Montreal next week.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.795
-Where are we with Titan's Rift?
-We're jammin'.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.129
We're good.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.007
Okay, good.

00:49.091 --> 00:52.427
'Cause earlier you guys were disagreeing
on what direction to go in, so…

00:52.511 --> 00:54.721
Yes, yes. But we figured that out,

00:54.805 --> 00:57.182
and we've been
working really well together.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.892
Yeah, we're doing both our ideas.

00:58.976 --> 01:02.938
So we split the expansion down the middle,
and now Ian has his half and I have mine.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.859
That's not working together.
That's working separate.

01:06.942 --> 01:10.737
Either way, it fixed everything,
because we haven't fought in weeks.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.199
Oh, no. This is bad.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.327
I've seen this pattern before.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.497
It's the calm before the divorce.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.623
Oh, God.

01:22.666 --> 01:26.253
Jesus Christ, David.
We are not your parents.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.088
I was talking about my own divorce.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.049
Although, both apply, actually.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.887
David, you've got nothing to worry about.
We're stronger than we've ever been.

01:34.970 --> 01:38.640
That is the third time a woman has said
that to me in my life, I'll have you know.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.518
First was my mom, then my ex,
and now it's Poppy Li.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.145
Good Lord, man. Get a grip.

01:43.228 --> 01:46.648
The stage-gate meeting
is going to be fine. Promise.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.775
-After you.
-Thank you, Ian.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.235
Of course.

01:54.198 --> 01:56.408
Something bad is gonna happen.

01:59.661 --> 02:00.746
Yeah.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.555
Morning.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.806
-Morning.
-Morning.

02:21.725 --> 02:25.103
Everything seems copacetic
on the old home front, huh?

02:25.187 --> 02:26.730
We're gonna need to take…

02:26.813 --> 02:28.440
-Yeah. Looks that way.
-Yep.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.692
Yep, yep, yep.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.278
A lot of downtime
till the stage-gate meeting.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.614
Lot o' downtime.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.742
Ignore him. He's trying to draw us
into discussing a personal issue.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.870
Started dating again.
Well, joined the apps.

02:44.039 --> 02:48.627
Yeah. Lotta apps. Lot o' apps.

02:49.419 --> 02:52.673
Old Dirty Dave dropped his line
off the back of the boat.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.509
Yeah, time to sit back
and wait for some nibbles.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.679
Oh, my God, David, you're not dating.
You're trawling for a death partner.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.806
Sorry. I couldn't help it.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.266
It's okay.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.560
You took the bait.
Probably the only woman who will.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.186
Hello, Kristin.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.439
Smoker.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.109
Well, I guess I could start smoking.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.111
He's gonna get eaten alive.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.654
Not necessarily.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.657
It's a question of marketing.
See, David's a loot box.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.742
As a commodity in the sexual marketplace,

03:20.826 --> 03:22.995
he should present himself like a loot box.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.454
Offer a tempting exterior--

03:24.538 --> 03:26.915
To hide the fact
there's probably just garbage inside.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.251
As soon as the woman realizes
she's been duped,

03:29.334 --> 03:32.004
cognitive dissonance will kick in,
and she'll convince herself she wants it,

03:32.087 --> 03:33.380
-even though she knows she doesn't.
-Right.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.632
Hey! I am not filled with garbage.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.803
C.W.?

03:40.554 --> 03:41.722
Decline.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.017
Uh-oh.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.102
What is this? What is happening?

03:48.478 --> 03:49.730
-Hey, Poppy.
-Hey.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.481
What's goin' on?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.568
It was getting a little crowded
in there with my new team.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.821
So we're just gonna work
out of my old office for a little bit.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.281
-You're separating?
-What?

03:59.364 --> 04:02.784
No, we're still working together,
just from separate offices. It's easier.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.454
To have two places, right. This is bad.

04:05.537 --> 04:08.707
David! Stop being so dramatic.
This is temporary, okay?

04:08.790 --> 04:11.251
I'm gonna move back in
as soon as I'm done working on Hera.

04:11.335 --> 04:12.961
Yeah, right, that's what she said.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.464
C.W. is calling me. Decline.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.089
Wait, what is Hera?

04:17.173 --> 04:20.511
Ian and I came up with code names
for our separate halves of the expansion.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.263
His is Zeus, mine is Hera.
It's just simpler.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.515
To have different names.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.809
Right. Right.
I'm feeling very triggered right now.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.942
Who is it? If it's C.W., decline it.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.361
-No, it's J. Alfred Prufrock?
-J. Alfred.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.612
No, no, don't--

04:39.863 --> 04:41.490
My deception worked.

04:41.573 --> 04:46.537
Forgive this cloak-and-dagger routine,
but I must speak with someone.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.830
My very life is at stake.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.958
Hey, how's your life at stake?
Did you get the virus?

04:51.041 --> 04:54.419
Worse. A parasite
is threatening my literary life.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.965
My publisher is trying to rob me of
my characters.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.008
My stories. My life's work.

05:00.926 --> 05:04.680
The little bloodsucker sent me
this letter. Here, I'll screen share it.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.349
Breach of contract?

05:07.432 --> 05:11.103
They're claiming ownership over C.W.'s
intellectual property.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.647
All because I haven't delivered
the final installment

05:13.730 --> 05:16.233
of my seminal Anaren trilogy.

05:16.316 --> 05:20.571
Damn it! I won't let them
write the conclusion for me.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.574
You know what? I'm gonna help.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.909
Thank you, Brad.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.786
Sorry, not you.
I'm gonna get David a date.

05:27.870 --> 05:30.873
The man is an unsellable loot box.
Much more challenging.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.791
You take the C.W. thing. It's a good test.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.293
What? No, I'm not ready to--

05:34.376 --> 05:36.628
You're gonna be fine.
Just remember, in a negotiation,

05:36.712 --> 05:41.383
what you think is your greatest strength
can actually be your greatest weakness.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.891
This is

05:49.850 --> 05:52.060
exactly what I asked for.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.145
Yep.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.815
Which is a problem.
Where are we with time?

05:56.899 --> 05:58.942
On time and under budget.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.694
Under budget?

06:00.777 --> 06:03.280
Wow. That is a problem.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.199
Why is that a problem?

06:05.282 --> 06:08.160
I've never been on time and under budget.
It's not a good sign.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.037
Do you not like the work?

06:10.787 --> 06:13.957
I love the work, Phil.
The work is perfect.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.168
But don't you see how that's a problem?

06:16.251 --> 06:20.672
You're agreeing with everything I say, and
then you're giving in to all my demands.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.341
You want me to fight with you?

06:22.424 --> 06:24.218
Yeah, but I don't want you to plan for it.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.929
It has to happen organically,
like it does with Poppy.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.224
The high pressure and the friction,

06:30.307 --> 06:32.476
that's what turns coal into diamonds.

06:33.310 --> 06:36.396
-How much friction would you like?
-You're fucking useless!

06:36.980 --> 06:40.567
I'm sorry, man. You're fine, I guess,
as an art director or whatever,

06:40.651 --> 06:41.985
but I need someone that challenges me.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.488
And let's be honest, if we went at it,

06:44.571 --> 06:48.033
I'd turn you into a pretzel
both physically and intellectually.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.368
You're the boss.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.164
Buddy. You gotta stop now
because I'm losing respect for you.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.334
No. No.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.796
Not one person in this room bought that.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.050
Okay.
Why don't you go ahead and take a knee?

07:06.176 --> 07:08.595
Get up. Holy shit, man.

07:08.679 --> 07:11.306
Hey, Ian,
your mom is on the phone for you.

07:12.641 --> 07:13.642
My mom?

07:15.686 --> 07:16.687
Hello?

07:16.770 --> 07:19.606
-Battle royale.
-Fuck off, Brad.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.573
-Stop thinking about it.
-I can't.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.617
I'm sorry. You're really good
at game design, and I'm an idiot,

07:30.701 --> 07:32.995
and I just totally screwed up
Grouchy Goat for you.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.456
No, you didn't. You screwed it up for us.

07:39.084 --> 07:42.129
I'm still gonna make it happen.
Just gotta find another way.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.798
We don't wanna be
sittin' on this couch forever, right?

07:46.091 --> 07:47.593
Yeah. Totally.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.595
We both got big dreams.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.639
Huge, and…

07:52.723 --> 07:55.809
I just know another opportunity
is gonna come along for you, Dana.

07:55.893 --> 07:58.061
And when it does, I--

07:58.729 --> 08:01.023
Hey, tester. I got a job for you.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.359
-Her?
-Me?

08:04.443 --> 08:07.321
Sorry. Yeah,
you're the hostile, shrill one, right?

08:07.404 --> 08:10.866
Okay. Dismissing women based
on the perceived tone of their voice is--

08:10.949 --> 08:12.910
Great. Yeah, you're the one. Let's go.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.704
Come on.

08:16.205 --> 08:17.414
See you, I guess.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.429
Can it bypass verification?

08:34.014 --> 08:37.142
Okay, so,
if the other indication servers could--

08:37.226 --> 08:38.559
bypass verification…

08:38.644 --> 08:40.187
Can we get some more chairs?

08:40.270 --> 08:42.438
Shut up, Glasses! I'm thinking!

08:42.523 --> 08:45.526
I am so sorry. I did not mean
to yell at you, Glasses.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.779
-Anthony.
-Anthony. Anthony.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.657
I'm not mad at you guys. You--

08:51.740 --> 08:52.991
You are brilliant.

08:53.075 --> 08:56.870
I just-- I'm a little bit stressed
about the stage-gate meeting

08:56.954 --> 08:59.748
because I don't have anything
to show Montreal,

08:59.831 --> 09:02.417
and how am I supposed to
explain all of this to them

09:02.501 --> 09:04.503
in a way they'll understand?

09:04.586 --> 09:08.298
You wanna disrupt the MQ server client
architecture with a cloud-based solution

09:08.382 --> 09:12.010
that can simultaneously handle persistent
environmental changes across all instances

09:12.094 --> 09:14.555
and manage the biggest concurrent
player load ever conceived.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.265
-Yes!
-Which is impossible.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.349
No!

09:17.432 --> 09:19.685
It's not impossible.
It just hasn't been done before

09:19.768 --> 09:23.564
because I haven't figured out
a way to do it yet.

09:23.647 --> 09:27.192
God, why is there always one downer
in every group? Am I right?

09:27.276 --> 09:29.027
I hired you to build me up.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.571
You hired us to build Hera.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.657
Yeah, that too. Look.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.619
Ian had this way of stroking my ego
and bolstering my confidence

09:37.703 --> 09:39.955
to the point where I felt like
I could overcome anything.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.582
But you can't overcome
the laws of physics.

09:41.665 --> 09:42.791
You can't, dick!

09:42.875 --> 09:44.626
See, and now you've made me yell again.

09:45.711 --> 09:47.588
-Hey.
-What do you want?

09:49.506 --> 09:50.883
Sorry to bother you,

09:50.966 --> 09:53.051
but I think you're a genius.

09:53.135 --> 09:56.388
Maybe the most talented programmer
of our generation.

09:56.471 --> 09:57.723
Can you teach me to code?

09:57.806 --> 10:00.392
I wanna become a brilliant programmer
just like you.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.853
Dana, you had me at "genius."

10:02.936 --> 10:05.522
-Glasses, give her your chair.
-Seriously?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.107
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.359
I think that I should have
at least one employee

10:09.443 --> 10:11.987
that thinks I'm the greatest programmer
that ever lived.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.740
-I said "of our generation."
-Do you want the seat or not?

10:14.823 --> 10:17.743
You heard the genius.
Move your ass, Glasses.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.414
I like you.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.501
Mr. Strauss, your five o'clock is here.

10:26.502 --> 10:27.920
Hello. Jim Strauss.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.881
-Where is Mr. Longbottom?
-Right here.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.132
Say hello, C.W.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.760
I muted him for his own safety.

10:34.843 --> 10:38.472
Mr. Longbottom didn't wanna risk exposure
of any kind.

10:38.555 --> 10:42.017
I'm sure you understand.
So I'll be speaking for him today.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.769
Please, sit, sit.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.731
And who are you?

10:47.814 --> 10:50.067
Someone who sees right through your game.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.945
Let me guess, you took a look
at the entertainment landscape

10:53.028 --> 10:56.573
and saw a big payday coming your way
if you could get your grubby little hands

10:56.657 --> 10:58.575
on the adaptation rights
to C.W.'s trilogy.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.536
So instead of granting him
a reasonable extension

11:00.619 --> 11:02.955
to let him finish his story on his terms,

11:03.038 --> 11:04.581
you're rushing his creative vision.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.500
Which may be good for your bottom line,

11:06.583 --> 11:09.211
but it sure as shit
won't get you one of these.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.462
Where did that come from?

11:10.546 --> 11:13.090
Never mind that.
Now give us a six-month extension!

11:15.133 --> 11:18.554
The third book was due in 1982.

11:22.224 --> 11:23.767
May I use your restroom?

11:23.851 --> 11:25.060
Yeah, it's…

11:28.188 --> 11:30.107
Shit, shit, shit.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.195
David, my team and I have been
analyzing your social media,

11:35.279 --> 11:37.197
and I don't know where to begin.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.491
Hashtagging "YumYum" on food pics.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.827
Posting your wedding photos
on your dating profile?

11:41.910 --> 11:44.538
Well, those are the best pictures I have,
man.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.666
I got hair and makeup. I cut her out.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.002
David, she cut you out.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.339
Look, man.
I don't know if I'm comfortable with--

11:54.423 --> 11:55.465
I can't hear you.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.093
I said I'm-- I'm uncomfortable with this.

11:58.177 --> 12:00.012
I can't hear anything you're saying.
Speak up.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.890
I am embarrassed by you showing all this.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.683
That's weird, because
you weren't embarrassed

12:04.766 --> 12:07.102
showing this to the entire world.

12:07.978 --> 12:09.730
Hey, guys. Super excited because

12:09.813 --> 12:14.943
I just got my hands on the Canyon Grail
CF SLX 8.0 gravel bike.

12:15.027 --> 12:17.154
Usually retails for about 5,000.

12:17.237 --> 12:21.450
I managed to snatch her up for 4,500,
which was a bit of a coup.

12:22.826 --> 12:25.120
Dizzy Dave's Steal of the Week.

12:25.204 --> 12:27.247
Let's scrub all this shit, guys.

12:27.331 --> 12:30.292
Wait. What? You're gonna delete
all my social media?

12:30.375 --> 12:33.212
The first thing a potential date
is gonna do is google you.

12:33.295 --> 12:36.089
Your online presence is gonna shoot us
before we're out of the gate.

12:36.173 --> 12:38.091
Okay,
but won't I look like a serial killer

12:38.175 --> 12:40.177
if there's literally
nothing about me online?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.888
Hey, man, at least serial killers
offer up a little mystique.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.057
Unlike your bike shorts. Have a seat.

12:47.309 --> 12:48.894
What is this?

12:51.522 --> 12:53.482
Divorcée Dance Party.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.275
This is a Japanese dating sim.

12:56.235 --> 12:57.819
We're gonna soft launch you.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.030
We're gonna roll you out
in a market we don't give a shit about,

13:00.113 --> 13:01.448
then tweak everything that doesn't work.

13:01.532 --> 13:03.867
Once you get through 10 exchanges
with a sim woman

13:03.951 --> 13:05.994
without her rejecting you,
I'll know the product--

13:06.078 --> 13:08.580
-The human being with feelings.
-The human being with feelings

13:08.664 --> 13:10.541
is ready to be sold off
like a steer at auction.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.625
Love.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.002
Okay. Here we go.

13:14.086 --> 13:17.005
Old Dirty Dave's gonna cast a line,
maybe catch a shark.

13:17.089 --> 13:19.258
-You know what I'm sayin'?
-Yeah.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.093
Career woman. Here we go.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.886
Here we go. Let's see what you got.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.765
Shake it out. Yeah, shake it out.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.601
Can I buy you a drink?

13:29.685 --> 13:30.686
Good start.

13:30.769 --> 13:32.771
-At a bar. Pretty natural.
-All right.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.942
-Think she's writing something back.
-Uh-oh.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.444
"How about I buy you a drink?"

13:40.112 --> 13:41.196
Three points.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.906
-All right, let's do this.
-All right.

13:43.699 --> 13:47.578
-"I like a woman who takes charge."
-Nice.

13:47.661 --> 13:51.290
-"Make mine a Manhattan."
-Good drink.

13:51.373 --> 13:54.293
-"A lot of sugar"--
-Why are you still writing?

13:54.376 --> 13:58.297
"But worth the calories. #YumYum."

14:02.968 --> 14:04.136
She's writing.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.723
"My friends are leaving. Gotta go. Bye."

14:09.725 --> 14:12.269
Her friends are leaving.
Probably her ride.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.479
She's walking over to that hunky dude.

14:15.689 --> 14:19.359
Why would they animate that?
That's just, like, cruel.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.820
Hey, it's all good. It's your first time.

14:21.904 --> 14:22.905
Yeah, you're right.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.949
Hey, Shaq didn't hit every three-pointer
he made, right?

14:26.033 --> 14:29.036
Shaq didn't really shoot three-pointers.
He played primarily in the post.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.954
-I don't know much about basketball.
-Yeah.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.582
Can we get some menus?
We're gonna be ordering dinner.

14:43.175 --> 14:46.220
Brad was wrong about me.
I'm not a shark, and I never will be.

14:46.303 --> 14:49.932
And I'm no artist.
I'm a doddering old penny-a-liner,

14:50.015 --> 14:53.185
trapped in a prison of his own mediocrity.

14:53.769 --> 14:55.395
Occupied! Get the fuck out!

14:57.189 --> 15:01.401
What made me think
I could complete my trilogy?

15:02.194 --> 15:05.072
I've always bitten off
more than I could chew.

15:05.155 --> 15:08.367
It reminds me
of when I purchased the services

15:08.450 --> 15:11.328
of an oriental ladyboy in Phnom Penh.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.288
You can't say that. It's derogatory.

15:13.372 --> 15:16.834
No, you misunderstand, Josephine.
I hired her.

15:17.626 --> 15:21.588
I was an admirer.
In fact, I was in love with her.

15:22.256 --> 15:26.677
That is, until the little tart
zip-tied me to the radiator

15:26.760 --> 15:28.011
and robbed me blind.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.764
Jesus, can you stop being offensive
for, like, two minutes?

15:30.848 --> 15:34.184
Half the shit you say could get you
canceled. You are a total liability.

15:34.268 --> 15:37.104
Damn this loose tongue of mine.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.939
You're right. I am a liability.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.107
The biggest.

15:41.525 --> 15:45.737
Wait a second. That's what Brad meant.

15:47.322 --> 15:50.701
C.W., you're my greatest strength.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.209
I apologize for my behavior earlier.

15:59.293 --> 16:02.421
It was needlessly hostile,
and that's really just not me.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.256
In truth, we should be thanking you.

16:04.339 --> 16:08.093
The adaptation of C.W.'s work
will really help raise his profile.

16:08.177 --> 16:11.471
Well, we wish Mr. Longbottom
all the best in his future endeavors, so--

16:11.555 --> 16:13.098
And, for his part,

16:13.182 --> 16:16.643
C.W. wants to ensure the success
of the film and TV projects

16:16.727 --> 16:17.811
by helping promote them.

16:17.895 --> 16:21.023
He can't wait to talk to the press
about all his sources of inspiration.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.441
Isn't that right, C.W.?

16:22.524 --> 16:25.444
Indeed. You may ask yourself

16:25.527 --> 16:29.573
how many times must a man be waylaid
by oriental ladyboys

16:29.656 --> 16:31.241
before he learns his lesson?

16:31.867 --> 16:32.993
Well, in my case, three.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.747
Only three? I thought it was four.

16:36.830 --> 16:41.627
Yes, my dear child. It was four.
I'm being modest.

16:44.296 --> 16:45.756
Sorry, what is he talking about?

16:45.839 --> 16:48.634
Soliciting transgender sex workers
in Southeast Asia.

16:48.717 --> 16:52.262
It's the origin story of Chimera,
the central character in his trilogy.

16:52.346 --> 16:53.555
Oh, my God.

16:53.639 --> 16:56.725
You're familiar with the sci-fi writer,
Orson Scott Card.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.936
The film version of Ender's Game
didn't do so well

16:59.019 --> 17:01.563
after his views on homosexuals
came to light.

17:01.647 --> 17:04.023
And J.K. Rowling got canceled
with a couple keystrokes.

17:04.608 --> 17:08.819
So maybe it's in everyone's best interest
we discuss a new contract.

17:08.904 --> 17:11.823
One that allows C.W.
to finish his trilogy on his terms.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.117
Otherwise, you've got an 80-year-old man

17:14.201 --> 17:17.037
who's recently become quite savvy
with an Internet connection.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.332
And he knows how to screen share.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.876
My entire desktop.

17:23.794 --> 17:25.671
Fine! Fine! Fine.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.714
You have the extension.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.716
Huzzah!

17:30.926 --> 17:32.845
Thank you. Very nice to meet you, sir.

17:37.641 --> 17:41.520
"It's getting late, big boy.
Isn't it past your bedtime?"

17:43.230 --> 17:45.023
Hey. This is it, okay?

17:45.107 --> 17:48.068
Just get past this exchange,
and you'll be ready for the real world.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.404
Should I tell her that
it actually is past my bedtime?

17:50.487 --> 17:53.365
'Cause on the weekends, I go to bed early
to hit the farmers market.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.493
-No? Fight my instincts. Right.
-Yeah.

17:57.619 --> 17:58.662
No.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.373
I can't look. I can't look.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.837
"Wanna get out of here
and go back to my place?"

18:06.920 --> 18:09.006
-What? Wait, what? Yes!
-Hey!

18:09.089 --> 18:12.301
-David, you did it!
-I did it! I did it! Yes!

18:17.055 --> 18:18.557
What is this? What is this?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.184
You were interacting with real women.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.312
The interface was so you wouldn't
get in your head and muddy the data.

18:23.395 --> 18:26.607
-What about Paul?
-I'm the career woman.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.443
Yeah. We're still a little light
on the ladies at MQ.

18:29.526 --> 18:32.821
-So, was I chatting with David?
-Yes, you were. Yeah.

18:32.905 --> 18:34.740
David, meet Sue, the girl next door.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.658
And, of course, Carol, the vixen.

18:36.742 --> 18:40.329
Brad, you told me this was
a new sexual harassment training software.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.539
Are you using company time
and company equipment

18:42.623 --> 18:44.583
to help David find a date?

18:44.666 --> 18:46.627
Actually, Carol, you are.

18:46.710 --> 18:51.548
And if I'm not mistaken, I think you just
propositioned our pal David here for sex.

18:51.632 --> 18:52.758
Carol, naughty.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.343
That is not what happened.

18:54.426 --> 18:58.639
I was testing the parameters
of what I thought was a new HR tool.

18:58.722 --> 19:02.017
Blimey, Carol. I wouldn't let David
in my knickers for a million quid.

19:02.601 --> 19:04.102
-Thanks, Paul.
-I mean--

19:04.186 --> 19:05.938
Carol, are you gonna let him say that?

19:07.272 --> 19:10.776
Sue. We didn't match up?
I thought we had a good rapport.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.362
Yes, well, David,

19:13.445 --> 19:16.198
I just cannot imagine
being the vessel to your seed.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.116
Does that make sense?

19:18.200 --> 19:20.494
-That does make sense.
-Okay.

19:20.577 --> 19:21.703
Thank you.

19:21.787 --> 19:24.373
What matters is that eventually,
you matched up with Carol.

19:24.456 --> 19:26.166
-Carol, yes.
-Yes.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.001
Yeah, I did, and she's a human being.

19:28.085 --> 19:29.086
-Right?
-You know?

19:29.169 --> 19:30.462
That counts. She's got a pulse.

19:30.546 --> 19:31.672
-That's good.
-Right.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.549
David, I don't wanna hurt your feelings,

19:33.632 --> 19:36.510
but I could not dislike you more

19:36.593 --> 19:38.345
or be less physically attracted to you.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.265
Great.

19:41.807 --> 19:42.808
Great.

19:42.891 --> 19:46.186
But hey, man, all we gotta do
is apply this to your dating profile,

19:46.270 --> 19:48.063
and we're gonna land you a woman.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.108
Yeah.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.734
A woman who hates me.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.408
Hey, man, a sale's a sale. We got this.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.786
Yeah. Thanks, man.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.123
Fuck.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.711
Okay, so…

20:11.795 --> 20:14.131
It's all great, and you love it,

20:14.214 --> 20:16.884
but you don't wanna show it to Montreal
because it's not good enough,

20:16.967 --> 20:18.802
and it's also
exactly what you're looking for?

20:18.886 --> 20:21.972
It's just not that hard to understand.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.682
What do you want from me, man?

20:23.765 --> 20:27.144
I want you to be
your normal, indignant, annoying self.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.729
I am not annoying, okay?

20:28.812 --> 20:31.899
Just because I speak truth to power
doesn't mean--

20:31.982 --> 20:33.942
Yes. That's it.

20:34.026 --> 20:37.946
Keep doing all that annoying stuff except
make it about me and not the world.

20:39.781 --> 20:42.117
Okay. You're short?

20:42.201 --> 20:45.537
You're short! I'm not short!
I'll kick you through that goddamn window!

20:45.621 --> 20:47.331
-How is this helping you?
-It isn't!

20:47.414 --> 20:49.458
-I don't know what to do!
-Shit.

20:50.125 --> 20:53.420
What did you think was happening
just then? Did you just flinch?

20:53.504 --> 20:55.088
Did you think I was gonna hit you?

20:55.172 --> 20:56.882
I didn't know
if you were gonna punch or kiss me.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.384
Why would I kiss you? I'm gay!

20:59.468 --> 21:02.012
-It's happened before, all right?
-Oh, my God!

21:02.095 --> 21:05.432
It doesn't matter. I don't know what
we're talking about at this point.

21:05.516 --> 21:07.267
I'm so confused.

21:09.603 --> 21:11.772
Can you see anything? What are they doing?

21:11.855 --> 21:13.565
Looks like they're working.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.151
What's that supposed to mean?
We're working.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.320
I didn't say we weren't.

21:18.403 --> 21:21.490
Stop disagreeing with me. This is so bad.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.617
He's gonna have so much more than me.
I'm screwed.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.868
You're right?

21:25.786 --> 21:27.037
You're meant to support me.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.705
I was just keeping it a hundred with you.

21:28.789 --> 21:31.124
Maybe try keeping it 75 with me.
I'm your boss.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.210
Okay. Sorry.

21:35.671 --> 21:36.880
Jesus Christ!

21:36.964 --> 21:40.217
He just snapped his laptop in half.
He looks mad.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.345
Shit. Ian is on fire
when he starts breaking things.

21:43.428 --> 21:46.807
Shit, shit, shit.
I have nothing to show Montreal.

21:46.890 --> 21:50.435
When they see all of Ian's work, they're
gonna kill my half of the expansion.

21:51.019 --> 21:53.522
I just need
one good idea to buy myself some time.

21:53.605 --> 21:54.648
Hey, Poppy!

22:04.575 --> 22:07.202
Goddamn it. Did he have that made?

22:10.038 --> 22:11.456
All right. Fine.

22:11.540 --> 22:14.168
-Let's get to--
-Oh, my God.

22:14.251 --> 22:16.628
My legs.
My fucking legs have gone to sleep!

22:16.712 --> 22:18.589
Help me. Help me up. I can't--

22:18.672 --> 22:21.758
Make me go standing up.
Ow! Don't touch them.

22:21.842 --> 22:23.177
-Okay.
-But help me.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.387
Maybe… No. Just rub for a second.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.973
-No, don't touch them!
-I don't know what to do.

22:34.271 --> 22:36.982
She wouldn't date me
in, like, a million years.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.569
Oh, yeah. Maybe if I had a different face.

22:40.652 --> 22:41.945
As if.

22:42.029 --> 22:43.989
There's my favorite commodity.

22:44.615 --> 22:47.242
Don't you mean unsellable loot box
filled with garbage?

22:47.326 --> 22:50.162
Come on. I was wrong about that,
all right?

22:50.245 --> 22:51.788
See, you can't be a loot box,

22:51.872 --> 22:53.957
because when someone buys a loot box,
they're stuck with it.

22:54.041 --> 22:55.792
If a woman is unhappy with you,

22:55.876 --> 22:58.837
she'll toss you back,
and that's a return, not a sale.

22:58.921 --> 23:00.881
We gotta think about you
like a burlap sack.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.716
A burlap sack?

23:02.799 --> 23:06.512
Boom. The least popular item
in MQ's online store.

23:06.595 --> 23:10.891
It's not flashy. It's not fun,
but the people who do buy it need it.

23:10.974 --> 23:14.436
It's useful.
It's reliable, and it can carry shit.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.522
That's all a certain type of woman
is looking for.

23:16.605 --> 23:18.941
-Is this supposed to make me feel better?
-No, but this will.

23:19.024 --> 23:22.819
-Check out your new dating profile.
-What? You redid my dating profile?

23:24.071 --> 23:27.533
I have a date tonight with Linda?

23:27.616 --> 23:29.701
That's my mom's name. That's great.

23:29.785 --> 23:32.120
No. Jane from Yorba Linda.

23:34.706 --> 23:36.375
That's a bit of a drive, isn't it?

23:36.458 --> 23:38.877
Couldn't really find anybody
in the urban areas, or suburban.

23:38.961 --> 23:39.962
Had to go rural.

23:40.045 --> 23:43.006
Actually, more agricultural,
and got some nibbles there.

23:43.090 --> 23:44.925
But Jane's a catch. She's a teacher.

23:45.008 --> 23:49.137
She owns her own home, and unlike
the smoker, she has no arrest record.

23:49.221 --> 23:51.849
No arrest record?
Oh, my God. That's hard to find.

23:51.932 --> 23:54.393
Yes. She's just a nice, lonely woman.

23:55.978 --> 23:57.688
Be Jane's burlap sack, David.

23:59.022 --> 24:01.149
I will carry her load.

24:03.735 --> 24:05.404
Okay, give me that back.

24:07.322 --> 24:10.409
Thanks, bud. Love you, Brad.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.619
-Not as much as I love Linda.
-Jane.

24:12.703 --> 24:14.204
Jane, right. Not my mom.

24:15.414 --> 24:16.874
Right.

24:19.084 --> 24:20.836
-Hey, Pop, Pop, Pop.
-Hey. Hi.

24:20.919 --> 24:21.920
Hey.

24:22.671 --> 24:25.299
-What are we doing?
-I think it's the stage-gate meeting.

24:25.382 --> 24:27.050
No, I mean, you and me.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.636
You know, we used to be
such great partners.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.848
I feel like the only time we see each
other is when we're arguing about money.

24:32.931 --> 24:34.308
What are you saying?

24:34.808 --> 24:38.270
Maybe… you and I
should give it another shot.

24:39.313 --> 24:43.066
What if you moved back into the office,
and we tried to work together again?

24:43.150 --> 24:44.443
For the sake of the game.

24:44.526 --> 24:47.988
We could be one big happy expansion again.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.199
You wanna get back together?

24:50.282 --> 24:53.619
Well, yeah. You know,
for the game. For the game, but also--

24:53.702 --> 24:54.870
Hey, Poppy!

24:54.953 --> 24:56.622
Hey, just got the demo.

24:56.705 --> 25:00.375
Battle royale mode looks incredible!
Montreal's gonna be stoked!

25:02.586 --> 25:04.463
You did a battle royale?

25:04.546 --> 25:08.258
No. It's a tournament-style,
last-man-standing mode

25:08.342 --> 25:10.219
where the players battle for supremacy--

25:10.302 --> 25:11.303
Battle royale.

25:11.386 --> 25:14.223
So, we were on a break… to be clear.

25:14.306 --> 25:18.894
You did it. You turned into a seagull.

25:20.270 --> 25:21.438
Baby!

25:23.398 --> 25:26.401
You only did this
to turn Montreal against me.

25:26.485 --> 25:28.612
Oh, please.
Ian, not everything's about you.

25:28.695 --> 25:32.574
You don't want them to like me, do you?
You want them to like you and not me.

25:32.658 --> 25:34.409
No. I did what's best for the game.

25:34.493 --> 25:36.203
You did what's best for you!

25:36.286 --> 25:38.622
Oh, please,
Ian, not everything is about you.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.166
-Yikes. It doesn't look good.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.877
You wanna yell in front of them?

25:43.961 --> 25:46.296
That, Brad, is my childhood.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.632
-Look at what you're doing to them!
-And your marriage.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.300
-And my marriage.
-Not about me?

25:50.384 --> 25:52.970
This is what always happens.
You think that everything that I do--

25:53.053 --> 25:56.640
Let's just do this in front of everybody.
Is that what you want?

25:56.723 --> 25:58.684
Now you're embarrassed about people…

26:06.692 --> 26:09.987
Hey, guys. I'll be performing
"Run-Around" by Blues Traveler.

26:17.077 --> 26:20.038
I like coffee and I like tea

26:20.122 --> 26:23.083
To be able to enter the final plea

26:23.166 --> 26:26.170
I still got those dreams
That you just can't shake

26:26.253 --> 26:28.964
I love you to the point
That you can no longer take

26:29.047 --> 26:32.467
But okay, all right
Let's feel that way

26:35.053 --> 26:36.972
But yeah

26:37.806 --> 26:41.226
Why you gotta give me the runaround?

26:41.310 --> 26:44.479
It's a surefire way to… things up

26:47.524 --> 26:49.860
Me down

26:50.736 --> 26:53.488
Love that song.
