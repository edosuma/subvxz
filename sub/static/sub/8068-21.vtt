00:04.838 --> 00:06.740
[theme music]

00:47.581 --> 00:49.483
[laughter]

01:02.096 --> 01:04.865
Eh, whatever
happened to Dondi?

01:04.965 --> 01:05.766
Didn't you hear?

01:05.866 --> 01:07.067
He married little Orphan Annie.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.736
They're hoping for
a kid with eyes.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.207
Have you guys seen my jeans?

01:13.307 --> 01:14.108
No, Darlene.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.110
We don't wear your jeans.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.179
Well, they didn't just
get up and walk away.

01:18.279 --> 01:21.282
Well, yours could have.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.583
Funny, mom.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.152
Baby, did you find the ad yet?

01:24.252 --> 01:26.654
Uh, ba, ba, ba, ba,
ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.222
Yeah, here it is.

01:28.322 --> 01:32.726
Late model washer and dryer,
great condition, low noise,

01:32.826 --> 01:34.762
works dandy.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.597
Ah, that's poetry, ain't it?

01:36.697 --> 01:37.965
[chuckles]

01:38.065 --> 01:40.100
You know that perfectly
describes the washer

01:40.201 --> 01:41.502
and dryer we just bought.

01:41.602 --> 01:45.439
Now let me try to run down the
ad on the one we're to unload.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.341
Hey, you think I get
any suckers in here

01:47.441 --> 01:50.043
to look at it if I
wrote windscreen broken,

01:50.144 --> 01:53.113
agitator cracked, no knobs.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.582
Hey, that sounds like you.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.555
Well look at you
two, straight out

02:01.655 --> 02:06.026
of the pages of GQ and Vogue

02:06.126 --> 02:06.927
Hey, Jackie.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.262
I saved Kathy for you.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.832
There's some great tips
in there on landing a man.

02:11.932 --> 02:12.933
No kidding?

02:13.033 --> 02:17.171
Well, Dan I-- I wish
you the best of luck.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.105
[laughs]

02:18.206 --> 02:19.573
Are the little rug rats ready?

02:19.673 --> 02:20.708
Where are you
taking them today?

02:20.808 --> 02:22.776
To the Greek market
on 19th street.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.313
Darlene's got to take something
to school for Greek week.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.348
Well, why don't
she take Adonis here?

02:30.284 --> 02:32.052
ROSEANNE: Ooh, baby.

02:32.152 --> 02:32.986
Hi, Aunt Jackie.

02:33.086 --> 02:33.921
[gasp]

02:34.021 --> 02:35.923
Monstroid.

02:36.023 --> 02:37.258
You ready to roll?

02:37.358 --> 02:38.158
Yeah.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.159
Where you rolling to?

02:39.260 --> 02:40.528
The baklava store.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.730
Yeah, well you're not going
no place looking like that.

02:42.830 --> 02:46.500
Go upstairs and comb your face.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.469
It takes four people
to make baklava?

02:48.569 --> 02:50.471
Only Darlene is
making baklava.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.273
The rest of us are escaping.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.408
You mean you don't want
to spend a delightful Sunday

02:54.508 --> 02:56.910
with mumsie and popsie?

02:57.010 --> 03:00.648
The two most boring people
on the face of the earth?

03:00.748 --> 03:02.316
Sunday around here is death.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.017
Will dad have a
third cup of coffee?

03:04.117 --> 03:05.018
[mocking gasp]

03:05.118 --> 03:08.055
Will mom get off
the sofa by noon?

03:08.155 --> 03:09.590
Will don't you get the
hell out of my house?

03:12.593 --> 03:13.627
And stay out.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.628
DAN: Scram.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.230
[door closes]

03:16.330 --> 03:19.367
Well, baby, we're all alone.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.902
Ooh, no kids.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.136
What should we do?

03:28.108 --> 03:33.180
Aw, you mustn't go back to
the sewers from whence you came.

03:33.281 --> 03:36.717
Oh, the tragedy of it all.

03:36.817 --> 03:41.154
I love you even though
you're not of my species.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.891
I thought I'd wet my
great, big, warm paws

03:43.991 --> 03:45.726
around that
refrigerator compressor.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.729
Ah, foiled again.

03:48.829 --> 03:52.600
Hey, how long's this
manly job going to take?

03:52.700 --> 03:53.934
One hour, two max.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.303
Why?

03:55.403 --> 03:57.638
Because I got a pay check's
worth of beef in the freezer.

03:57.738 --> 04:01.809
No sweat as long as
nobody opens the door.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.611
Good bye my love.

04:03.711 --> 04:04.512
Aw.

04:10.818 --> 04:11.652
[laughs]

04:11.752 --> 04:12.553
[knock on door]

04:12.653 --> 04:13.454
Go away!

04:13.554 --> 04:14.588
DAN: Get it!

04:14.688 --> 04:17.124
It may be somebody for
the washer and dryer.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.126
Eh, why don't you ever get it?

04:19.226 --> 04:22.830
I have to do every
damn thing around here.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.231
What?

04:24.332 --> 04:25.132
Good afternoon, ma'am.

04:25.232 --> 04:26.099
How are you today?

04:26.199 --> 04:27.868
I'd just like a
moment of your time.

04:27.968 --> 04:28.769
I've already been saved.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.507
But not from dirt.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.176
Yeah, well, who's is
the centerfold this month?

04:36.276 --> 04:40.514
I represent Grease Splits,
the ultimate cleaning solution.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.982
Well, I'm pleased to meet you.

04:42.082 --> 04:45.453
I represent filth.

04:45.553 --> 04:48.021
This product is
designed for women

04:48.121 --> 04:52.025
just like you, who don't have
the time to deal with grime.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.394
Well, I got that time.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.229
I just like it.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.399
One demonstration
will convince

04:58.499 --> 05:03.971
you that you cannot live
without this supreme product.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.807
Can I trouble you
for a glass of water?

05:06.907 --> 05:10.277
I've been on my feet all day.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.145
Yeah, sure.
Come on in.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.482
I really appreciate this.

05:14.582 --> 05:17.117
Now watch out for
that baked on grease.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.152
Of course, after we get
out of the living room

05:19.252 --> 05:21.755
you ought to be safe.

05:21.855 --> 05:22.890
Do I really have
to tell you not

05:22.990 --> 05:24.157
to let strangers in the house?

05:24.257 --> 05:26.193
Oh, he's just a
harmless old man.

05:26.293 --> 05:27.628
Sure, harmless.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.397
Why don't you pick up
a newspaper some time.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.831
See how many of these
so-called harmless

05:30.931 --> 05:32.700
people turn out to
be serial killers.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.468
No, he ain't no serial killer.

05:34.568 --> 05:38.271
Anthony Abadack at age 68,
retired bakery truck worker.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.742
Known to his neighbors as
kind, good with children,

05:41.842 --> 05:45.178
charged with the murder
of 22 innocent housewives.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.448
The bodies were scattered
all over eastern Michigan

05:47.548 --> 05:49.049
and pieces of strudel.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.084
What kind of strudel?

05:51.184 --> 05:52.319
Housewife strudel.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.220
[chuckles]

05:54.287 --> 05:56.189
Well, he is no
serial killer, Dan.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.725
He just wants to
drink a glass of water

05:57.825 --> 06:00.394
and sell me $2000 bucks
worth of cleaning products.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.229
That's my second problem.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.897
Just don't buy anything.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.733
What makes you think
I'm going to buy anything?

06:05.833 --> 06:08.869
Because this looks like
aisle 12 at Budget Club.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.838
Honey, I think it's
time you exercised

06:10.938 --> 06:13.073
a little financial restraint.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.443
You know, I
think you're right.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.810
I can't afford you any more.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.079
Get out.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.714
Listen you, I'm
saving us a bundle

06:20.814 --> 06:23.183
by fixing that compressor
under the fridge.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.418
Yeah, unless you
screw up, and have

06:24.518 --> 06:27.354
to pay some repairman
double Sunday overtime.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.656
Hey, you, I got a manual.

06:28.756 --> 06:29.990
Eh,
[mumbles]

06:30.090 --> 06:30.891
What was that?

06:30.991 --> 06:32.392
Nothing dear!

06:32.493 --> 06:34.161
All right.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.664
Oh, I'm sorry Mister,
but we're going to have

06:36.764 --> 06:38.432
to skip the demonstration.

06:41.869 --> 06:42.870
Excuse me.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.905
Mister?

06:45.005 --> 06:45.873
Mister?

06:45.973 --> 06:47.040
Come on.

06:47.140 --> 06:47.941
Mister?

06:48.041 --> 06:48.842
What's wrong?

06:48.942 --> 06:49.977
I think he passed out.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.044
From what?

06:51.144 --> 06:52.279
I don't know.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.280
Go check his pulse.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.181
You check his pulse.

07:01.622 --> 07:02.856
Oh my god.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.291
What, what's wrong?

07:04.391 --> 07:05.859
I think he's dead
is what's wrong.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.696
Check it again.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.397
I know how to count to zero!

07:17.037 --> 07:21.475
Crimeanellies, what
are we going to do?

07:21.575 --> 07:24.144
I'll call 911 and you see
if you can find out who he is.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.178
How am I supposed to do that?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.147
Well, look for his wallet.

07:30.317 --> 07:33.053
What are you doing with that?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.789
I'm going to make a salad.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.190
Come on, Dan!

07:37.290 --> 07:38.859
Roseanne, there's no
way I'm sticking my hands

07:38.959 --> 07:39.760
into this guy's pockets.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.833
Hello?

07:45.933 --> 07:46.934
He has no wallet.

07:47.034 --> 07:47.901
Yeah, I'll hold.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.108
Hey, I don't mean to be an
ungracious hostess here,

07:55.208 --> 08:00.180
but uh, when do you think
our guest might be leaving?

08:00.280 --> 08:02.415
As soon as the coroner
pronounces the subject dead,

08:02.516 --> 08:03.951
then the body can be moved.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.954
He, I pronounced him
dead over a half hour ago.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.989
That's true, she did.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.791
The coroner needs to
make that determination.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.426
You do not want to
be wrong about dead.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.228
No sirree, that would
be a real catastrophe.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.830
That guy shouldn't have
even been in the house

08:16.930 --> 08:18.165
in the first place.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.101
We're talking nine, ten
hours of paperwork, easy.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.303
Now I'll just go out to my car,
radio the coroner's office,

08:23.403 --> 08:25.005
have them check with the
morgue, and make sure they

08:25.105 --> 08:26.206
got room in the fridge.
So.

08:26.306 --> 08:29.376
Well, see if they've
got room for a romp roast.

08:29.476 --> 08:32.312
Roseanne, the
refrigerator will get fixed.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.747
Well, just forget
about the refrigerator.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.716
Now what are we going to do
if somebody comes over here

08:35.816 --> 08:37.384
to look at that washer
and dryer and they see

08:37.484 --> 08:39.920
our company still laying here?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.454
Right, blame me.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.091
I invited the guy in the
house in the first place.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.628
So I invited him, so what?

08:47.728 --> 08:48.796
I didn't buy anything.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.998
Only because he dropped dead.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.734
That still counts.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.469
Now look it, usually if somebody
drops dead in my kitchen,

08:56.570 --> 09:00.407
I will take the blame, but
this is nobody's fault.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.710
Why is there a cop
car outside our house?

09:02.810 --> 09:04.244
Cop car?

09:04.344 --> 09:07.948
Oh, engine trouble.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.550
Is that for your baklava?
- Yeah.

09:10.651 --> 09:14.087
One pound of bac,
two pounds of lava.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.689
You guys take that
into the kitchen.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.658
Oh no, Dan, you go
get the bags for them.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.526
You kids stay out
of the kitchen.

09:19.627 --> 09:20.427
Why?

09:20.527 --> 09:22.630
I washed the floors in there.

09:22.730 --> 09:23.997
So how come dad can go in?

09:24.097 --> 09:26.800
He helped me.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.369
You washed the
floors on a Sunday?

09:29.469 --> 09:30.604
Yeah, I'm going
to start washing

09:30.704 --> 09:32.005
the floors every Sunday.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.907
Just like every Sunday you're
going to start taking the kids

09:34.007 --> 09:35.342
to movies and stuff like that.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.343
What?

09:36.443 --> 09:37.778
Yeah, we'll all
turn over a new leaf.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.379
Yeah, I'm going to be
better housekeeper.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.513
You're going to
be a better aunt.

09:40.614 --> 09:41.649
What are you doing?

09:41.749 --> 09:43.050
How come you're kicking
us out of the house--

09:43.150 --> 09:44.885
Jackie, I know what I'm doing
and I know what you're doing.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.087
Now, take them to a movie,
and when it's over, call me,

09:47.187 --> 09:48.221
and maybe we can
meet for dinner.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.156
Oh, what about my baklava?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.357
It's due tomorrow.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.424
I haven't forgotten about you.

09:51.524 --> 09:54.628
I'm still trying to
reach the coroner.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.129
Heh, heh, heh.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.164
Coroner?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.465
Who died?

09:58.565 --> 09:59.933
Yeah, who died?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.268
Some guy.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.569
We don't know his name.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.404
He was a salesman.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.007
He came to the door
right after you left.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.275
He died in our house?

10:08.375 --> 10:12.379
Did the police man shoot him?

10:12.479 --> 10:13.346
No, honey.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.348
He just kind of
wound down like when

10:15.448 --> 10:17.584
your toys need new batteries.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.953
I've never seen a dead body.

10:20.053 --> 10:23.023
Yeah, where'd
you guys stash him?

10:23.123 --> 10:23.924
He's in the kitchen.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.258
You don't need to see him.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.627
I'll be the judge of that.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.362
I'll be the judge of that.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.764
Well, so what's
going to happen to him?

10:30.864 --> 10:32.332
Well, when the
corner gets here,

10:32.432 --> 10:33.867
he's going to take
care of everything.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.203
Mm, let's go upstairs.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.239
I'm going to go take a peek.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.507
Me too.

10:40.607 --> 10:41.709
No you're not.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.576
Listen, you take your
little brother outside,

10:43.677 --> 10:45.278
and go play, and have fun.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.579
All right, Deej.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.348
Let's go wave to the meat wagon.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.717
[door slams shut]

10:49.817 --> 10:52.920
I hope that guy
gets here soon.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.321
I ain't touching
that refrigerator

10:54.421 --> 10:55.622
till Willy Loman's outta here.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.161
Did you get a hold
of the coroner?

11:01.261 --> 11:02.996
No, but I did get
a hold of his wife.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.665
He's in the middle
of a golf tournament.

11:05.766 --> 11:06.934
So get him.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.669
Heh, you don't know the
coroner when it comes to golf.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.738
Well, you don't
know me when it

11:10.838 --> 11:13.540
comes to stiffs in my kitchen.

11:13.640 --> 11:14.842
How long is this
going to take?

11:14.942 --> 11:16.009
Well, they just teed off.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.145
It's the Members
Guest Tournament,

11:18.245 --> 11:19.179
and it is jammed out there.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.647
[sighs]

11:24.718 --> 11:26.186
Well, don't look at me!

11:26.286 --> 11:28.255
If we would have had sex
like wanted to, none of this

11:28.355 --> 11:29.156
would have ever happened.

11:33.927 --> 11:37.064
Now, why can't we move Mr.
Excitement out to the garage

11:37.164 --> 11:39.132
or something like that?

11:39.232 --> 11:40.400
Lady, rules are rules.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.170
The body cannot be moved
until the coroner gets here.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.405
[thumping in back]

11:45.505 --> 11:46.306
Aw, what the hell?

11:56.750 --> 11:59.219
What did you do?

11:59.319 --> 12:02.489
I just lifted the
sheet to take a look.

12:02.589 --> 12:03.757
Look, just don't touch him.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.058
Don't fool around,
don't put your hands

12:05.158 --> 12:07.627
on him, just don't, OK?

12:07.727 --> 12:10.363
Well, I've never seen
a dead body before.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.664
Well, if that
coroner don't get here,

12:11.765 --> 12:13.066
you're going to be
eating dinner with one.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.604
Gross.

12:17.704 --> 12:21.074
Mr. Conner, would you
give me a hand please?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.076
You've got to be kidding me.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.845
Well, Dan, that's
how I found you.

12:27.647 --> 12:30.017
We got to put the body back
into the original position

12:30.117 --> 12:32.019
in which it was found.
- Well, good.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.922
Originally, it was found
standing at the front door.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.024
Hey, you're the authorities.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.658
If you want him
moved, you move him.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.559
Thanks.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.663
When's the body
going to start to rot?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.568
I think I've got a
few good years left.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.508
Well, I got to
make my baklava.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.111
So what's stopping you?

12:58.211 --> 12:59.880
Well, it's getting late, huh?

12:59.980 --> 13:01.481
Is there going to be
enough room on the table

13:01.581 --> 13:03.016
for me to lay out
my phyllo dough?

13:03.116 --> 13:03.917
Phyllo dough?

13:04.017 --> 13:05.252
What are you making?

13:05.352 --> 13:06.153
Oh, baklava.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.120
It's for school.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.924
[speaking greek]

13:11.024 --> 13:11.892
You know Greek?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.827
Yeah, I am Greek.

13:13.927 --> 13:14.727
Prove it.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.500
How long is stuff
supposed to bake?

13:20.600 --> 13:25.005
Well, till the crust is nicely
browned, but not dried out.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.107
You see, it's OK now, but we
should check it in about a half

13:27.207 --> 13:28.008
an hour.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.843
OK?

13:29.943 --> 13:32.645
Man, I hate working
on Sundays, don't you?

13:32.745 --> 13:33.546
[chuckles]

13:33.646 --> 13:34.814
Come on.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.149
[groans]

13:37.617 --> 13:40.854
Have you seen my manual?

13:40.954 --> 13:41.955
What did I do with it?

13:42.055 --> 13:42.856
Oh.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.631
[paper rustling]

13:56.603 --> 14:00.407
Look, uh, I'll make you a deal.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.977
You don't bother
me and, heh, heh--

14:08.081 --> 14:09.482
[sighs]

14:16.089 --> 14:17.991
[metal clanking]

14:39.579 --> 14:40.981
[thumps]

14:43.583 --> 14:44.451
Thought we had a deal.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.362
[grunts]

14:59.933 --> 15:01.801
[struggling]

15:01.901 --> 15:03.803
[heavy breathing]

15:08.408 --> 15:10.543
Well, geez, I guess
I just can't leave you

15:10.643 --> 15:12.112
boys alone for five minutes.

15:18.051 --> 15:21.688
I hate you and
everything you stand for.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.090
[knocking]

15:23.190 --> 15:24.457
DARLENE: I'll get it.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.692
You owe me.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.260
You owe me forever.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.595
Rump roast, Dan.

15:28.695 --> 15:29.496
Rump roast.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.864
DARLENE: Someone's here!

15:31.965 --> 15:33.033
Great.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.068
Tell him we're in the kitchen.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.837
Finally.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.041
The washer and dryer
are right over there.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.243
Hi, I'm Donny Karoszek,
and this is my wife Carol.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.144
Hi.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.312
Hi, I'm Dan Conner.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.613
This is my wife Roseanne.
- Hi.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.748
- This my daughter Darlene.
- Hi.

15:48.848 --> 15:52.519
Dad, aren't you going to
introduce them to Uncle Edward?

15:52.619 --> 15:53.920
Darlene, honey.

15:54.021 --> 15:57.124
Why don't you run along
and play, sweetheart?

15:57.224 --> 16:01.594
Well, the neighborhood
is kind of dead today.

16:01.694 --> 16:02.495
Darlene.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.497
[clapping hands]

16:04.597 --> 16:06.499
I'm going!

16:06.599 --> 16:08.735
Well, I guess you guys want
to see the washer and dryer.

16:08.835 --> 16:09.802
They're right here.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.271
I believe we still
have a set in stock.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.172
[chuckles]

16:12.272 --> 16:13.440
Is this a good time?

16:13.540 --> 16:14.607
Oh, yeah.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.444
We're all just kicking back.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.746
Washer and dryer
right in here.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.656
I think I got
Becky feeling better.

16:29.756 --> 16:30.823
How did you manage that?

16:30.923 --> 16:31.724
A quart of scotch.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.096
Very funny.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.097
How's he doing?

16:37.197 --> 16:39.166
He's still dead.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.268
He's probably doing
better than any of us.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.803
That's the cosmic
joke, Roseanne.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.572
He's the happiest
man on the planet.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.040
And how do you figure that?

16:47.140 --> 16:48.175
His troubles are over.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.010
He'll never again have
to stand in a line.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.213
He'll never again have
to listen to the Muzak

16:53.313 --> 16:54.947
version of Muskrat Love.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.519
Never again have
to eat a hamburger

16:59.619 --> 17:01.254
and bite into one of
those little hard things.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.626
How do you feel about
electric shock therapy?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.165
Well, uh, I don't know, honey.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.066
What do you think?

17:13.166 --> 17:14.334
I don't know.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.203
What are you uh, what
are you asking for it.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.570
$125.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.573
Yeah, but there's no knobs,
and the lint screen's broken--

17:20.673 --> 17:22.309
OK, $50.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.311
[beeping]

17:24.411 --> 17:25.512
- It's time!
- It's time.

17:25.612 --> 17:26.913
- It's time!
- It is time.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.014
Time for what?

17:28.115 --> 17:29.849
Uh, it's time
for his medicine.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.718
It's medicine time.
It's medicine time.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.520
It's his medicine time.

17:33.620 --> 17:34.887
It's medicine time.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.723
Uh, medicine time--

17:36.823 --> 17:38.158
[smashes]

17:42.028 --> 17:44.131
Well, you guys are going
to have to go now, you know,

17:44.231 --> 17:45.298
because it's time
for him to take

17:45.398 --> 17:47.066
his medicine and everything.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.636
What does he take
the medicine for?

17:49.736 --> 17:52.672
He has muscle
spasms in his neck.

17:52.772 --> 17:53.606
$35.

17:53.706 --> 17:54.807
We'll discuss it
in the other room.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.075
Rosie, you give
him his medicine.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.378
You know, my aunt had
terrible neck spasms.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.580
Sometimes all she needed
was a good massage.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.481
[chuckles]

18:01.581 --> 18:02.882
That's a great idea, honey.

18:02.982 --> 18:05.218
Why don't you take the
Karoszeks in the living room,

18:05.318 --> 18:07.287
and I'll work on Uncle Edward.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.988
You know, I hope this
isn't out of place,

18:09.088 --> 18:11.023
but I am a massage therapist.

18:13.726 --> 18:17.664
Oh, boy.
He is stiff.

18:17.764 --> 18:22.402
$7.50, but you got to say yes.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.936
How are you doing, honey?

18:24.036 --> 18:26.473
A lot better than him.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.408
I feel bad for him.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.777
A poor old man has to go
door to door to earn a living

18:30.877 --> 18:33.146
and he ends his life in
the kitchen of a house

18:33.246 --> 18:35.248
he was never even in before.

18:35.348 --> 18:39.886
Well, if you were feeling any
different than you're feeling,

18:39.986 --> 18:41.888
something would
definitely be wrong.

18:41.988 --> 18:44.657
Well, then there's obviously
something wrong with Darlene.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.294
No there isn't, honey.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.262
She feels just as bad as you.

18:49.362 --> 18:52.199
She just shows it
in a different way.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.133
[speaking greek]

18:54.234 --> 18:55.668
Oh, great.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.003
Mom, there's an
ambulance outside.

18:57.103 --> 18:57.970
Side

18:58.070 --> 18:59.539
Yeah, and some
guy with a golf bag.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.708
Well, it had to be the
coroner because if it's a golf

19:01.808 --> 19:02.975
salesman, we're out of chairs.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.181
- How's my baklava?
- It's very hot.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.749
Don't touch it.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.050
Ouch, it's hot.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.519
You think just
cause you've got a gun

19:12.619 --> 19:15.087
she's going to listen to you?

19:15.188 --> 19:16.088
[knocking on door]

19:16.189 --> 19:19.292
Well, that must be Dave.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.561
Should we put the
sheet back over him?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.162
Let's just put it
right back on DJ's bed.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.265
Let's put it on Darlene's bed.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.766
And let's see who
can yell the loudest.

19:26.866 --> 19:27.667
I can!

19:27.767 --> 19:28.568
Now shut up.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.578
Yup, he's dead.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.080
Well, there's that
in-depth medical expertise

19:41.180 --> 19:42.715
we've been waiting for.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.585
Right him up, Jane.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.486
Bag him, Hank.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.620
Name?

19:47.720 --> 19:48.555
Uh, John Doe.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.797
[door slams shut]

19:57.897 --> 19:59.866
A guy shouldn't have to
live his whole life just

19:59.966 --> 20:02.134
to be buried as John Doe.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.170
Well, they'll find out
his real name tomorrow.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.606
He needs a name tonight.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.709
Well, what are we
going to call him?

20:09.809 --> 20:10.777
He kind of looks like a Charlie.

20:14.747 --> 20:15.982
Mm, maybe he looks
like a George?

20:19.952 --> 20:21.421
He's a William.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.823
Definitely a William.

20:23.923 --> 20:24.857
William it is.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.266
Hey, hold on a second.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.041
I don't know where
you're going, Mister,

20:42.141 --> 20:45.812
but if you bump into Janis
Joplin, tell her I said hi.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.718
[theme music]

21:02.161 --> 21:04.130
I tried that technique
you told me about.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.411
Where's DJ?

21:18.511 --> 21:20.880
DJ!

21:20.980 --> 21:24.617
Oh, I'm so glad
we have an intercom.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.953
He's been upstairs all day
making gifts for everyone,

21:27.053 --> 21:30.022
but he won't say what they are.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.724
Who cares?

21:31.824 --> 21:34.226
OK, everybody close your eyes.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.665
OK, open your eyes.

21:38.765 --> 21:39.566
What did you get us, bub?

21:39.666 --> 21:41.434
Toe tag.
