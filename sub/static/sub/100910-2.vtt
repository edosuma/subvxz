WEBVTT

00:05.339 --> 00:06.540
Previously on Hightown...

00:06.574 --> 00:08.509
- You Sherry?
- Yeah?

00:08.542 --> 00:09.610
Cool.

00:10.277 --> 00:12.613
She's wearing a
necklace says Lylas.

00:12.646 --> 00:13.647
Fuck!

00:13.681 --> 00:16.083
- You know Sherry Henry.
- I don't know what you're
talking about.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.052
She told me so much about you.

00:18.085 --> 00:19.420
I saw a fucking murder.

00:20.087 --> 00:21.622
These people will kill me.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.058
Found a dead body today.

00:24.091 --> 00:26.327
- Want to buy me a drink?
- Okay.

00:32.299 --> 00:33.667
There's this guy. He's black.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.736
- He's from somewhere else.
- Dominican Republic?

00:35.770 --> 00:37.171
- Haiti?
- Yeah.

00:37.204 --> 00:40.074
I need to know if any cops
been coming around.

00:40.107 --> 00:42.643
Yeah. One came by
the club last night.

00:42.676 --> 00:45.613
He comes back around,
I want you to get close.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.314
I might actually prefer
you go to prison.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.186
Yeah! Yo, hook me up!

02:58.412 --> 02:59.647
Hey, hey, what's up?

03:01.682 --> 03:03.784
- How you living?
- All right.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.352
Day eight.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.921
I thought you were
out after detox.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.524
I got that good insurance.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.927
Besides, I got
nothing to go back to.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.428
I hear that.

03:15.763 --> 03:16.830
Yo, who's that?

03:18.532 --> 03:19.667
Tina.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.403
That girl is my heart.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.772
She new?

03:24.805 --> 03:26.840
She was here before. Slipped.

03:26.874 --> 03:27.942
Came back.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.779
Hey, I been working on that.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.547
I put in the hours. I got dibs.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.382
Fuck dibs.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.829
I'm Jackie.

03:48.862 --> 03:49.863
Hey.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.366
I haven't smoked in a minute.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.634
Let me hit that?

03:57.805 --> 03:59.640
Who smokes menthols?

04:00.307 --> 04:01.642
I do.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.411
Oh, yeah? Who are you?

04:06.847 --> 04:09.316
Oh, my God. Oh, shit.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.920
Oh, my God! Oh, yeah.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.289
Oh, yeah, right there,
right there, right there.

04:15.322 --> 04:17.825
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.326
Good girl.

04:21.328 --> 04:22.830
I want you to come for me.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.299
You know I'm straight, right?

04:25.332 --> 04:26.834
Oh, okay. You want me to stop?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.702
No, no, no. No, no, don't stop.

04:28.736 --> 04:29.737
Don't stop.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.674
Fuck!

04:35.442 --> 04:37.378
Hey, Jeremy.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.480
- How's your dad doing?
- He's better, thanks.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.781
Good, good. Good to hear that.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.984
J-dogg. Question
for you, my man.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.620
Oh, shit, what's
that guy's name?

04:46.654 --> 04:48.789
- Big guy.
- Yeah, deals for Frankie.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.824
Big black dude,
Dominican, I think.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.459
Osito.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.561
Yeah, Osito, that's right.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.596
So where's he live?

04:57.498 --> 04:58.666
You got a number for him?

05:00.034 --> 05:03.070
I don't really know him.
I just heard the name.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.471
Well, you know,
it's so funny, man.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.440
We were asking around town,
and no one's saying shit,

05:06.473 --> 05:09.877
so this might be your chance
to get a big gold star next to
your name.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.879
Nah, I'm good.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.048
You ever kicked in jail, Jeremy?

05:14.081 --> 05:17.484
- What?
- You know, vomiting, diarrhea.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.354
- You do not want diarrhea in
jail. - You can't fucking do
that.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.556
Kid, we got you last month,
20 grams of fentanyl.

05:22.589 --> 05:25.926
So the only reason that you're
not in Barnstable right fucking
now

05:25.959 --> 05:27.361
is that you agreed to cooperate.

05:27.394 --> 05:28.595
Now, we already
pulled the warrant,

05:28.629 --> 05:30.030
so why don't you tell us
what you know about Osito?

05:30.064 --> 05:31.465
- Fuck you. I don't know
anything. - Fuck me?

05:31.498 --> 05:32.666
I already told you I
don't know anything.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.834
Motherfucker said fuck me to me.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.502
- Bullshit.
- I don't know him.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.005
- Fuck this guy, let's go.
- No, you can't do that!

05:38.038 --> 05:39.973
I already told you what I know!

05:40.007 --> 05:42.776
We had a fucking deal, come on!
Fuck you guys!

05:42.810 --> 05:44.812
I told you everything I know!

05:58.092 --> 05:59.093
Open up.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.032
Step on through.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.769
Hi, I'm Junior.

06:09.636 --> 06:10.938
I'm an alcoholic and an addict.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.573
- Hey, Junior.
- What up, man?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.511
Anyways, thanks for having us.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.714
It's an honor to bring you a
meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous.

06:22.116 --> 06:23.517
Guy fucking sleeping over here.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.086
That's cool. I get it.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.721
I know what you're thinking,

06:27.755 --> 06:29.790
"What the fuck does this kid
got to say about me?"

06:31.792 --> 06:33.761
Maybe you're right.
Maybe you got your shit figured
out.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.095
I don't know.

06:35.129 --> 06:38.098
For me, the only shit I ever
figured out was how to hustle
and lie

06:38.132 --> 06:39.967
and break people's hearts.

06:41.935 --> 06:45.139
I mean, I'm a fucking dope
fiend, and fentanyl fucking
killed me.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.574
I mean, like, literally
killed me a couple times.

06:51.478 --> 06:55.182
I'm fucking lucky to be
standing here right now, but I
am.

06:55.415 --> 06:59.153
And I'm standing here sober.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.821
That's a fucking miracle.

07:02.156 --> 07:04.792
So, yeah,

07:04.825 --> 07:07.561
if it can happen for a piece-of-
shit dope fiend like me...

07:09.496 --> 07:10.831
...it can happen for you.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.671
All prisoners,
return to your cells.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.706
All blocks, five
minutes to count time.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.941
Five minutes to count time.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.609
Return to your cells.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.713
Yo, preacher man.

07:28.749 --> 07:29.750
Hey.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.021
You look good. Fresh.

07:35.522 --> 07:36.857
New kicks.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.159
Yeah, pretty new.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.095
So what the fuck happened?

07:42.129 --> 07:43.831
I'm sorry.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.165
I thought you were the boat guy.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.001
I mean, yeah, it was just,
the swell was off the chain.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.037
It was a fucking supermoon, bro.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.675
"It was a supermoon, bro."

07:55.742 --> 07:59.012
Yeah, it's just a really big
moon. It fucks with the tides
and shit.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.714
I'm really sorry.

08:06.553 --> 08:07.554
What?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.023
Just...

08:10.057 --> 08:11.692
It was a girl.

08:11.725 --> 08:12.793
Yeah.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.061
It was.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.835
I take care of you,
right? Money's good?

08:21.869 --> 08:23.737
Yeah, Frankie, it's good.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.139
When I was getting high,
it was cool, you know,

08:26.173 --> 08:27.808
and now I don't
know, it's just...

08:29.776 --> 08:31.245
What are you saying?

08:35.048 --> 08:36.149
I'm done.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.187
I'm cool with the
pumping and all that.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.555
It's just...

08:41.588 --> 08:44.057
Not with the bodies, you know?

08:50.664 --> 08:54.268
You think you get to
make decisions here?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.105
No, papa, no.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.109
You're done when
I say you're done.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.746
When you're done, you
won't even know it.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.319
Yeah.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.093
So are we gonna hang out later?

09:20.127 --> 09:21.561
Yeah, I'll see you after lunch.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.597
- Okay, let's begin.
- I'd like that.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.165
Who would like to share?

09:29.102 --> 09:30.737
Hey, I'm Jackie.

09:30.771 --> 09:35.642
So, like, a week ago, I couldn't
imagine not drinking or
partying, right?

09:36.977 --> 09:39.980
But now I realize
that it was really messing with
my life.

09:40.981 --> 09:45.285
And, like, I'm cool
being sober, you know?

09:45.319 --> 09:48.188
Still me, still having fun.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.723
It's all good.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.159
I don't really know why people
think it's so hard.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.361
What do you have,
like, eight days?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.630
Yeah, so?

09:56.663 --> 09:57.965
So what the fuck do you know?

09:57.998 --> 09:59.032
Bethany...

09:59.066 --> 10:01.368
What is this
bringing up for you?

10:02.169 --> 10:05.305
I don't appreciate her
acting all high and mighty.

10:05.339 --> 10:07.140
This is my fifth treatment,

10:07.174 --> 10:10.010
and I'm only in here now
'cause drug court took pity on
me.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.945
Otherwise I'm looking
at real prison time.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.915
It's not my fault
she keeps relapsing.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.784
- Excuse me, bitch?
- Jackie, Bethany has a point.

10:18.352 --> 10:21.221
You may be on what
we call a pink cloud.

10:21.254 --> 10:24.224
In early sobriety,
we have energy, clarity.

10:24.257 --> 10:28.228
It feels so good and easy to be
sober that we think it'll never
be hard.

10:28.261 --> 10:31.798
But that feeling won't last
forever unless you do the work.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.267
- I told you, bitch.
- Call me bitch again, bitch.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.236
Right, what, what?
Don't fuck with me!

10:36.269 --> 10:37.838
David! David!

10:37.871 --> 10:40.640
- Get off of me!
- Fucking with me, bitch!

10:40.674 --> 10:41.675
- Fuck you!
- Hey, hey!

10:41.708 --> 10:42.709
I told you!

10:46.713 --> 10:48.115
Take a seat.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.217
She started it. Talk to her.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.952
I did talk to her.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.821
I told her
that I will not tolerate
violence,

10:54.855 --> 10:56.123
and she no longer
has a bed here.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.426
Whoa, shit.

10:59.659 --> 11:03.363
Yeah, and I'd like to remind you
of the "no fraternization"
policy.

11:03.397 --> 11:05.999
You keep this thing up with
Tina, you won't have a bed here
either.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.769
Tina? What are
you talking about?

11:09.236 --> 11:11.972
You don't think I know
everything that goes on around
here?

11:13.907 --> 11:17.878
I'd like us to start examining
your relationship to women and
sex.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.281
What? I love women and sex.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.920
Have you ever had a
serious relationship?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.758
One, Devonne.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.195
But we broke up, and
now she hates me.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.030
Do you think your drinking
played a part in that?

11:37.064 --> 11:38.098
No.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.834
Yes, okay, my drinking
played a part in it.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.102
But it wasn't just that.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.073
I mean, I loved her, and I
wanted to want the same stuff as
her,

11:46.106 --> 11:48.275
like kids and a house, whatever.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.444
But I couldn't.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.114
I didn't mean to be a shithead.
It just happened.

11:55.782 --> 11:58.452
Which I'm pretty sure is what my
dad would say if you asked him.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.954
What's your dad like?

12:00.987 --> 12:02.923
He's an old-ass fisherman.

12:02.956 --> 12:06.827
Lost part of his finger on a
tuna boat and still made his
quota that day.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.762
Sounds like you admire him.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.431
Yeah, I admire
that part, I guess.

12:12.466 --> 12:13.467
Yeah.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.337
But he also, like, fucked over
my mom and cheated on her a
thousand times.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.139
Probably still does.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.508
Do you think you're like him?

12:23.810 --> 12:25.345
I'm nothing like him.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.115
But that's crazy, right?

12:29.316 --> 12:31.952
Like, who's trying to fuck
his nine-fingered old ass?

12:32.819 --> 12:35.188
I've noticed you make jokes
when you're uncomfortable.

12:35.822 --> 12:38.925
Oh, yeah? Let's talk
about your dad's sex life, Doc.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.494
You want to change
the subject, fine.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.096
You have cleaning
duty for a week.

12:46.833 --> 12:47.834
Got a name for you, Lieutenant.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.103
- Yeah?
- Osito.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.338
That's a name?

12:51.371 --> 12:52.939
It's a nickname.

12:52.973 --> 12:56.977
So I've authorized 30 hours of
OT since the murder, and you
don't have shit.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.845
Hey, look, nobody's talking
about this guy.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.448
We've been busting heads all
week, and only one dude cops to
knowing him?

13:01.481 --> 13:03.183
What does that tell you?

13:03.216 --> 13:04.384
Nothing.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.486
Tells me Osito's a player.

13:06.520 --> 13:10.190
Come on, you don't even have a
real name for this chucklehead.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.224
Not yet.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.359
"Not yet."

13:13.326 --> 13:15.362
I got the phone records
from corrections.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.231
Get to it.

13:20.534 --> 13:23.203
Oh, and the check
engine light came on.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.872
When's the last time
you got the oil changed?

13:25.906 --> 13:28.942
I don't know. A while ago.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.111
You have to do it
every six months.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.379
Take it in today.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.820
What about those
dinosaur nuggets?

13:40.854 --> 13:43.223
No, he's totally over those now.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.127
You like that, baby?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.495
Yeah.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.298
You like how I suck that cock?

13:51.331 --> 13:54.334
Yeah, baby, I love
it. Take that cock.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.535
I'm gonna take it all.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.480
Oh, yeah.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.649
It's so deep in my throat, baby.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.950
Oh, man.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.053
Yeah.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.388
Oh, yeah.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.056
You gonna come for me?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.940
Hey, you still want to chill?

15:40.974 --> 15:42.342
Yo, you know this girl?

15:43.176 --> 15:45.078
Yeah, that's Krista Collins.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.147
- We came in around the same
time. - Who is she?

15:47.180 --> 15:48.648
I don't know. Just some chick.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.183
When did she leave?

15:50.216 --> 15:51.985
I don't know. Like,
two weeks ago.

15:52.018 --> 15:54.154
Two... What day?

15:54.187 --> 15:56.389
Maybe Thursday? I don't know.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.358
Holy shit, Thursday.
Are you sure?

15:58.391 --> 16:00.560
No, I'm not sure. Why?

16:00.593 --> 16:01.695
What is this about?

16:02.996 --> 16:04.264
Nothing.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.507
Hey, some girl's
having a seizure.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.009
The nurse told me
to come get you.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.310
What nurse, Sharon?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.245
I don't know. Yeah.
The one with the brown hair?

16:19.279 --> 16:21.381
Yeah, Sharon.
She's been here three months
already.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.450
It's time she figured out
how not to call me

16:23.483 --> 16:25.051
every time she has a problem.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.566
Jesus, woman, close your tabs.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.425
Oh, shit.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.453
Hey.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.588
She's severely weather
-beaten, right?

18:30.710 --> 18:31.778
I know, Ma.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.280
I know what it looks like.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.415
But I...

18:35.849 --> 18:37.383
I really am clean
now, I swear to God.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.553
Krista, you got to be
fucking kidding me.

18:40.587 --> 18:44.190
After what you did last time,
you shouldn't even be back in
Wareham.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.259
I know, I know. I'm
sorry, I just...

18:47.760 --> 18:50.730
I was really fucked up,
but I got 42 days now.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.199
Please, Ma.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.370
I'm really trying to stay clean.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.207
Please, I got
nowhere else to go.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.813
You need to get out of here
before Markie sees you.

19:06.846 --> 19:07.914
Ma...

19:08.147 --> 19:09.682
You need to go.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.230
Hey.

19:24.898 --> 19:25.899
Good morning, Jackie.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.934
Can I talk to you?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.669
What time do we have one-on-one?

19:30.403 --> 19:31.538
4:00?

19:31.571 --> 19:32.672
Well, then we'll talk at 4:00.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.240
Please, it's kind of important.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.510
Do you know of a resident
named Krista Collins?

19:37.544 --> 19:39.345
I can't discuss
my other patients.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.580
Even if she's in trouble?

19:41.581 --> 19:42.916
What is this, Jackie?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.453
I told you about the body
on the beach, right?

19:47.487 --> 19:49.422
Well, I found
something out, like...

19:50.290 --> 19:52.225
Maybe Krista Collins
had something to do with it,

19:52.258 --> 19:56.496
and I feel like I feel
like I need to look into that.

19:57.897 --> 19:58.932
What do you think?

19:59.799 --> 20:03.269
I think if you have information,
you should call the police.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.404
Okay, well, hold on.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.638
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.307
What else do you think?

20:08.508 --> 20:12.545
I think you're a newly sober
alcoholic looking for something
to fix on

20:12.579 --> 20:14.380
and that this is an obsession of
the mind, just like the big book
talks about.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.282
Why does this always have
to be about me being crazy?

20:16.316 --> 20:17.750
I mean, maybe I'm supposed
to be doing this.

20:17.784 --> 20:18.952
Like, why me, you know?

20:18.985 --> 20:21.354
Why did I find that body?

20:21.387 --> 20:24.991
- Maybe my purpose is to save
this girl. - That's very noble.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.226
But there's only one person
you need to save,

20:27.260 --> 20:28.595
and it's not Krista Collins.

20:28.628 --> 20:31.698
Yo, this isn't some, like,
bullshit teachable moment.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.766
This is real life.
We're talking about a murder.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.602
Yes, and you're not a cop.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.437
I have investigations training.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.339
Yeah, marine investigations.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.341
I'm here voluntarily, and I can
leave whenever the fuck I want.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.375
You're right.

20:42.408 --> 20:45.545
You want to screw up your DUI
case and your job to play cops
and robbers,

20:45.578 --> 20:46.579
be my guest.

20:46.613 --> 20:47.814
You know what? Fuck you.

20:47.847 --> 20:48.982
I don't need your permission.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.487
In my opinion, you leave now,
you're gonna drink.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.648
You look like ass.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.317
Yeah, well, the other guy
looks like your ass.

21:29.022 --> 21:30.657
Good morning, Lieutenant.

21:30.690 --> 21:35.028
Turns out, Frankie Cuevas is not
using the prison phones to
discuss business.

21:36.029 --> 21:37.864
Nope, I know it was my idea.

21:38.931 --> 21:42.035
But I got another line on Osito
I'm working on right now.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.370
No, I'll keep you in the loop.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.539
Hey, Renee.

21:47.740 --> 21:48.808
Hi.

21:50.777 --> 21:53.012
Oh, what's up, little man?

21:53.046 --> 21:54.447
Look what I got you.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.683
- That's cool, huh?
- See how your arm goes.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.419
- Huh?
- Look at that.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.820
Nice throw, buddy. Go get it.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.457
What the fuck are
you doing here?

22:04.490 --> 22:05.558
What?

22:05.591 --> 22:07.760
How did you even find me?

22:07.794 --> 22:09.062
It's kind of what I do.

22:10.396 --> 22:11.664
Renee?

22:13.800 --> 22:14.901
It's okay.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.336
Relax.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.905
No one knows I'm a cop.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.541
I'm just a guy taking
a walk on the dunes.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.378
Hey, listen, that thing
we were talking about...

22:25.411 --> 22:27.380
you had a really good
instinct on that.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.415
Great.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.883
- So we're even?
- Almost.

22:30.917 --> 22:33.386
I need you to introduce Osito
to an undercover cop.

22:33.419 --> 22:34.554
What?

22:35.788 --> 22:37.090
Who's Osito?

22:38.357 --> 22:39.592
Don't do that.

22:40.426 --> 22:43.629
I know you know the dude.
Text him and set up a buy.

22:46.432 --> 22:47.533
You want me to do it?
Give me your phone.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.868
Okay, I fucking know
the guy, all right?

22:48.901 --> 22:50.503
But I can't today.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.939
I'm on a fucking field trip,
and I'm working tonight.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.907
So, what, people don't buy drugs
during the day?

22:54.941 --> 22:55.942
Text him.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.945
We'll do it after you
drop off Frankie Jr.

23:02.115 --> 23:04.450
Hey, I've seen your rap sheet.

23:05.118 --> 23:06.919
Possession, possession with
intent, solicitation...

23:06.953 --> 23:08.755
Yeah, you mind keeping
your voice down?

23:08.788 --> 23:10.790
My point is, that
was five years ago.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.125
You're doing good.

23:13.626 --> 23:14.961
You're doing really good.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.799
Frankie ain't
doing shit for you.

23:21.434 --> 23:24.003
Or else you wouldn't be dancing
at Xavier's.

23:24.036 --> 23:27.073
I know they froze his assets,
and that's got to be real hard
for you.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.976
But with Frankie away,
you have a chance to do things
different.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.545
Now, what are you gonna do
when he gets convicted?

23:32.578 --> 23:35.481
Help me. Let me help you.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.650
I can be a real friend, Renee.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.987
Right here, right
now, you and me.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.655
Let's be friends.

23:58.171 --> 24:00.072
$200 for electricity?

24:00.106 --> 24:01.607
Your arraignment's Wednesday.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.075
You need money for the lawyer?

24:03.109 --> 24:04.544
No, it's okay.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.045
Need a ride to court?

24:06.078 --> 24:08.181
Oh, fuck, I don't have a car.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.116
Fuck!

24:10.149 --> 24:12.685
You think maybe you should've
stayed there a little longer?

24:12.718 --> 24:15.188
No, that place
sucked, all right?

24:15.988 --> 24:17.190
Don't worry about it. I'm sober.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.591
That's the point, right?

24:20.626 --> 24:21.761
What?

24:22.528 --> 24:24.230
Come on, just tell
me whatever it is.

24:26.165 --> 24:27.633
I talked to Hunniker.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.970
I don't think it's
gonna go your way.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.707
What do you mean,
like, I'm fired?

24:35.575 --> 24:37.109
He can't fucking do that.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.745
He's the boss.
He can do whatever the fuck he
wants.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.714
You know I'm the only person of
color in the Northeast Division

24:41.747 --> 24:43.182
and one of the
only female agents?

24:43.216 --> 24:45.017
Come on, you're the
toughest chick I know.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.086
You really got to
play that card?

24:47.119 --> 24:48.754
And then with the Spanish thing?

24:48.788 --> 24:51.190
You got to admit,
with all the quotas and shit,

24:51.224 --> 24:53.192
it's probably helped you
more than it's hurt you.

24:53.226 --> 24:56.529
Jesus Christ, Ed,
would you just admit you voted
for Trump?

24:56.562 --> 24:59.031
I voted for Gary Johnson.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.702
Get the fuck out
of here, all right?

25:03.236 --> 25:05.504
I got to start
figuring out my life.

25:10.643 --> 25:13.579
Maybe you can figure out how to
make it to one of those
meetings.

25:13.613 --> 25:14.981
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.751
Thanks, Ed.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.837
Krista Collins...

25:46.779 --> 25:49.081
The number you have dialed
has been changed, disconnected,

25:49.115 --> 25:50.783
or is no longer in service.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.919
Please check the
number and dial again.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.955
Holy shit.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.171
Jesus Christ.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.878
Okay.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.613
I know she doesn't look like it,

26:20.646 --> 26:22.782
but Trooper Babcock here
is actually a professional.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.651
Fuck off, Ray.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.853
You're gonna use
this for the buy.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.189
So I'm the one
giving him the money.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.792
No one's getting arrested today.
I want you to remember that.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.327
- The goal here...
- Fuck.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.796
...is for us to form
a long-term relationship with
him.

26:37.663 --> 26:38.664
Okay.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.834
They're gonna be listening
on an open cell line.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.970
All you have to do
is introduce me to Osito,

26:44.003 --> 26:45.972
then ask if I can just text him
myself next time.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.373
It's a piece of cake, right?

26:48.007 --> 26:49.842
Yeah, for you guys.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.278
Well, how do I look?

26:52.311 --> 26:53.813
I look good, right?

26:53.846 --> 26:56.882
I look good, I'm wearing
athleisure, and I'm making it
work.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.384
This is a fitted sweatpant.

27:02.021 --> 27:05.658
Remember that time at the club
when Andre left with that ho?

27:06.192 --> 27:07.793
Bitch left us with no ride.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.228
See? You're a natural.

27:09.261 --> 27:10.396
- That's all it is. You got it.
- Okay, okay.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.630
You're in it. She's in it.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.200
20 minutes out.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.802
There you go.

27:16.836 --> 27:19.138
- You got this.
- Yeah.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.221
Leslie, talk to me.
What's going on over there?

27:36.155 --> 27:38.057
Check out the black SUV
that just pulled in.

27:39.692 --> 27:42.395
We got a black Chevy Suburban,
extra large,

27:42.428 --> 27:47.033
Mass plates, 7-7-Papa-8-Bravo-5.

27:47.066 --> 27:50.770
Registration's coming back
to a 90-year-old white woman on
Nantucket.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.338
That's Osito.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.073
That's my guy.

27:55.107 --> 27:56.242
We're going in.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.294
What up, O?

28:18.264 --> 28:19.965
Who's that?

28:21.300 --> 28:23.869
Oh, Osito, this is
my friend Leslie.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.171
Leslie, Osito.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.073
Yo, what kind of name is that?

28:27.940 --> 28:30.076
You didn't say you
was bringing nobody.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.110
Come on.

28:33.312 --> 28:34.713
She's my friend.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.216
What she want?

28:37.950 --> 28:41.220
I want to cop some motherfucking
dope is what I want.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.789
Jesus Christ, can
maybe that happen soon?

28:43.823 --> 28:45.958
I wouldn't let my
bitch talk like that.

28:46.792 --> 28:47.893
I know Frankie wouldn't either.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.228
Look, give me a
break, all right?

28:49.261 --> 28:50.930
Frankie's not here.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.432
He know you getting high?

28:54.066 --> 28:55.267
No.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.103
Doesn't need to either.

28:57.136 --> 28:59.738
This is some bullshit.
Should I just call my other guy?

29:01.807 --> 29:03.109
Who the fuck are you?

29:03.142 --> 29:04.210
Leslie.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.112
How you know 'Nee?

29:06.979 --> 29:08.414
We used to work
together at a place.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.983
What place was that,
junkiebitches.com?

29:11.016 --> 29:12.451
Fuck you.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.421
Okay, dude, you got
something for me or what?

29:17.022 --> 29:19.492
Don't ever bring
no one around I don't know.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.996
Get the fuck out of my car.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.034
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.437
That's fucked up.

29:38.511 --> 29:40.146
This motherfucker's smart.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.348
Sorry, guys, I
couldn't close it.

29:43.516 --> 29:45.017
No, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.254
Don't move.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.256
Ray, what you doing, man?

30:04.537 --> 30:05.871
Remy's?

30:38.070 --> 30:39.171
What the fuck?

30:51.951 --> 30:53.385
Oh, Fred, hey.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.054
I need the rent today.

30:55.087 --> 30:58.057
- Actually, the Wi-Fi just went
out, so... - It's not out.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.358
I changed the password.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.392
What? Why?

31:00.426 --> 31:02.428
This isn't
the Provincetown Public Library.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.296
- No rent, no Wi-Fi.
- Come on, man.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.232
Cut me some slack.
I've had a really tough week.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.267
This is going
to be news to you, Jacqueline,

31:08.300 --> 31:10.903
but your life choices
are not my problem.

31:10.936 --> 31:12.204
Really, Fred?

31:12.638 --> 31:14.173
I'll give you till
the end of the week.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.976
Fred, come on, I took your
fucking cat to the vet when you
were in Rome!

31:17.009 --> 31:19.445
Because you forgot to give her
her goddamn kidney medication.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.213
- She was in renal failure.
- Fine!

31:21.247 --> 31:23.249
You want your fucking
money, Fred? Here.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.490
Here, take your fucking money.
There you go.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.959
Fuck off,
'cause I cannot deal with you
right now.

31:34.460 --> 31:35.527
Fuck!

31:35.561 --> 31:37.563
- God...
- You okay?

31:37.596 --> 31:38.964
Fuck off!

31:39.598 --> 31:40.633
God!

32:16.969 --> 32:20.939
So, at this time, we'd like to
welcome any newcomers

32:20.973 --> 32:23.008
in their first 30
days of sobriety.

32:23.042 --> 32:27.012
Would any newcomers like to come
up here and introduce
themselves?

32:27.713 --> 32:30.082
Oh, excellent.

32:37.523 --> 32:38.524
Hey, I'm Brian.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.125
I'm an alcoholic.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.527
Hi, Brian.

32:49.101 --> 32:51.136
- Hey, give me one of those.
- Fuck off. You quit.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.572
- Come on, I can have one.
- No, you can't.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.477
I didn't even know
you were sober.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.512
I got three months, kid.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.715
- Nine days.
- Wow, that's great.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.718
You know you're, like, the only
person I know who doesn't drink?

33:07.386 --> 33:08.754
Hey, you want to be my sponsor?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.556
Fuck, no, I'm a piece of shit.

33:11.256 --> 33:13.392
- Besides, I'm a dude.
- I'm a dyke.

33:15.728 --> 33:18.163
Whatever, man. I
don't need a sponsor.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.568
Hey, I heard you
went to treatment.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.070
Still doing outpatient?

33:25.604 --> 33:27.172
Nah, I kind of just left.

33:27.206 --> 33:28.407
There was this thing.

33:29.141 --> 33:30.576
It's actually kind of fucked up.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.346
What? You know you can tell me.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.381
I don't give a shit.

33:39.418 --> 33:41.453
All right.
I mean, it's kind of crazy,
but...

33:42.721 --> 33:44.423
You know I found
that dead girl on the beach?

33:46.358 --> 33:47.559
Yeah.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.562
So I found this picture
of another chick in rehab,

33:50.596 --> 33:53.399
and I think it's connected,
and it feels like I got to do
something

33:53.432 --> 33:56.301
to save this girl or whatever.

33:56.335 --> 33:57.336
I don't know.

33:58.270 --> 34:00.572
- Is that crazy?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's crazy.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.241
You know you're a
fish cop, right?

34:02.274 --> 34:04.309
Yeah, so?

34:04.343 --> 34:05.411
Hey, look, if I
was your sponsor,

34:05.444 --> 34:08.580
I'd tell you to get your ass in
meetings and work on getting
your job back.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.582
You don't need to be saving some
girl who probably doesn't need
saving,

34:10.616 --> 34:12.651
who's probably getting high
right fucking now.

34:12.684 --> 34:16.054
'Cause that's how
we do, you know?

34:16.722 --> 34:17.723
Yeah.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.225
You know, when I first came in,
my sponsor said,

34:20.259 --> 34:22.795
"Buy yourself a suit, 'cause
you're gonna be going to a lot
of funerals."

34:24.730 --> 34:26.465
Most people don't get sober.

34:27.132 --> 34:28.634
We're the lucky
ones, you feel me?

34:30.602 --> 34:31.670
Yeah, I feel you.

34:33.605 --> 34:34.773
Yo, you want to grab some food?

34:34.807 --> 34:37.176
Nah, I'm seeing Donna now.

34:37.209 --> 34:38.377
Oh, yeah, you two
getting' it in?

34:38.410 --> 34:39.645
Working on it, kid.

34:56.628 --> 35:00.232
So don't be mad,
but my mom took Mackayleigh

35:00.265 --> 35:02.234
to get her ears pierced.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.503
Oh, I'm not mad.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.840
Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna get her some rocks.

35:08.841 --> 35:10.242
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.778
- Business is that good?
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.348
What is business?

35:19.218 --> 35:20.686
Don't start, Donna, please.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.388
Okay, I'm sorry.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.160
Thanks for coming
on a walk with me.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.130
Thank you for
assembling the crib.

35:33.866 --> 35:36.168
You sure you don't want to get
a drink or something?

35:36.201 --> 35:38.871
What, you think all it takes
is a few drinks, you'll get it
in?

35:38.904 --> 35:40.172
Yeah.

35:40.205 --> 35:42.140
Oh, we'll see about that.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.710
I remember the first
time we kissed.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.445
It was at the junior prom,

35:46.478 --> 35:48.146
and you were drinking
OE, remember that?

35:48.714 --> 35:50.349
I remember.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.718
You had a huge boner.
You didn't think I noticed.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.389
Hey.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.892
I know I fucked shit up with us.

36:01.894 --> 36:03.562
But I miss you.

36:04.563 --> 36:05.898
And I love you.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.736
I want to be together.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.757
I'm not ready. I'm sorry.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.392
No, it's okay.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.227
Just don't mind this huge boner.

36:39.298 --> 36:42.367
- When do you think you'll be
ready? - Oh, my God. Get the
fuck out of here.

36:50.976 --> 36:51.977
Hey.

36:53.278 --> 36:54.580
How you feeling?

36:55.280 --> 36:56.815
That was...

36:56.848 --> 36:58.216
that was kind of fun.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.618
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.888
I think maybe I'm awesome
at going undercover.

37:02.921 --> 37:03.956
No, you did good.

37:05.490 --> 37:06.625
I'm really proud of you.

37:08.293 --> 37:09.294
Yeah.

37:10.295 --> 37:11.763
Except you didn't
get what you wanted.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.399
Not yet.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.569
So listen.

37:17.603 --> 37:18.604
I know the pay sucks,

37:18.637 --> 37:22.808
but the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts would like to buy
you dinner.

37:26.311 --> 37:28.714
I really have to get to work.

37:29.481 --> 37:30.916
Sorry.

37:30.949 --> 37:32.985
- Another time.
- Yeah, yeah, no, I get it.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.486
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.558
I should probably...

37:39.591 --> 37:41.660
Yeah, get out of here.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.762
Yeah. Bye.

38:36.782 --> 38:37.783
Fuck it.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.443
Don't do it.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.814
Don't be a fucking asshole.

39:41.747 --> 39:44.449
All right, guys,
let's give it up for Candy.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.996
Next up, we've got Cinnamon.

39:59.865 --> 40:00.866
Osito?

40:02.801 --> 40:04.069
What are you doing here?

40:04.102 --> 40:05.604
What you think?

40:05.637 --> 40:07.139
I want to get a dance.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.941
Let me get Dakota.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.743
Thick-ass Brazilian girl.

40:11.777 --> 40:13.578
- You'll love her.
- Nah.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.148
I want to get a dance from you.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.152
I don't think Frankie
would like that.

40:22.954 --> 40:25.824
It's like you said,
Frankie's not here.

40:26.525 --> 40:27.526
I'm here.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.195
So we doing this or what?

40:54.719 --> 40:56.154
There you go.

40:56.188 --> 40:57.556
Got your dance.

41:06.832 --> 41:09.734
I should beat your ass
for bringing that junkie bitch
around me.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.536
Get the fuck off me.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.674
How long you been getting high?

41:15.707 --> 41:16.942
Why do you care?

41:16.975 --> 41:19.077
I told Frankie I'd
watch out for you.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.212
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

41:20.245 --> 41:21.847
That's what this is?

41:21.880 --> 41:23.081
You looking out for me?

41:23.114 --> 41:24.516
You're the mother of his kid.

41:24.549 --> 41:26.618
He needs to hear that you're
okay, that you're holding up.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.787
I'm out here on
my own, all right?

41:28.820 --> 41:31.089
Frankie's not doing shit for me.

41:31.122 --> 41:32.791
That chick...

41:32.824 --> 41:36.695
yeah, we have some guy who pays
us to do girl-on-girl for him,
all right?

41:36.728 --> 41:38.730
Sometimes I like to get high
before I eat out her pussy.

41:38.763 --> 41:40.265
Takes the fucking edge off.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.135
So you want to tell Frankie
I been fucking around, using,

41:44.169 --> 41:45.737
I don't give a shit.

42:18.270 --> 42:19.638
Hey, girl.

42:19.671 --> 42:21.172
Jack and Diet?

42:21.206 --> 42:22.274
Just Diet.

42:23.541 --> 42:24.776
Don't ask.

42:26.778 --> 42:29.881
Listen, you hear anything else
about that dead girl?

42:30.916 --> 42:31.917
No.

42:31.950 --> 42:34.552
But everyone knows
it was about drugs.

42:34.586 --> 42:38.123
My little nephew Ronnie's
bragging he used to deal to her
dealer or something

42:38.156 --> 42:39.824
up in Barnstable.

42:39.858 --> 42:41.226
These kids.

42:41.259 --> 42:43.828
Yeah, well, little Ronnie
should probably shut the fuck
up.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.063
Right?

42:45.096 --> 42:48.233
God bless him.
If he lives to 25, it'll be a
miracle.

42:48.266 --> 42:49.968
What about this girl?

42:51.002 --> 42:52.837
Seen her?

42:52.871 --> 42:54.806
I don't think so.

42:54.839 --> 42:56.308
But I'll tell you one thing.

42:56.341 --> 42:59.077
Those freckles
are like chocolate sprinkles

42:59.110 --> 43:01.579
on vanilla ice cream.

43:01.613 --> 43:03.148
You know what I'm saying?

43:04.983 --> 43:06.017
Hey.

43:06.051 --> 43:07.118
Hey.

43:07.152 --> 43:09.154
Can I buy you a drink?

43:09.187 --> 43:10.822
Oh, I don't drink.

43:12.157 --> 43:14.326
- Okay.
- Sorry, I mean you can stay.

43:15.660 --> 43:16.795
Sorry.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.732
You from around here?

43:20.765 --> 43:22.334
Yeah, yeah. You?

43:22.367 --> 43:24.669
Hyannis. I'm just
down for the night.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.772
Are you okay?

43:30.875 --> 43:32.377
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

43:32.610 --> 43:35.613
I'm just a little
fucked up right now,

43:35.647 --> 43:37.849
and everything's kind of crazy.

43:37.882 --> 43:40.251
We don't have to talk about it.

45:09.174 --> 45:10.175
Hey.

45:14.979 --> 45:16.448
Hey.

45:17.782 --> 45:19.350
How'd you sleep?

45:19.384 --> 45:20.852
Good.

45:20.885 --> 45:22.287
You wore me out.

45:25.190 --> 45:26.958
What do you got going on today?

45:28.093 --> 45:29.894
Nothing much.

45:29.928 --> 45:31.796
What'd you have in mind?

45:32.797 --> 45:36.468
I was wondering if maybe you
would give me a ride up to
Barnstable.

45:38.336 --> 45:39.471
Really?

45:42.340 --> 45:45.443
We got a hit on the prints
obtained during the controlled
buy.

45:45.477 --> 45:48.113
They matched
with a Dominican-Haitian dual
citizen

45:48.146 --> 45:50.281
by the name of Emmanuel Delgado,

45:50.315 --> 45:53.485
AKA Edmonton Vargas, AKA Osito.

45:53.518 --> 45:54.986
Came to East Boston as a kid.

45:55.019 --> 45:58.223
He was deported in 2017
after a trafficking bust.

45:58.256 --> 46:01.459
Apparently he's back,
and he's working for Frankie
Cuevas.

46:01.493 --> 46:03.995
We're looking at him
for the Sherry Henry murder.

46:04.496 --> 46:06.197
Good work, gentlemen.

46:29.020 --> 46:31.856
I guess congratulations
are in order.

46:31.890 --> 46:33.858
- Just doing my job.
- Don't be modest.

46:33.892 --> 46:35.894
Osito's gonna take you
all the way to the DEA.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.329
It's not about me.

46:38.363 --> 46:40.031
I told Sherry I'd keep her safe.

46:40.899 --> 46:42.267
Isn't it always about you, Ray?

46:43.535 --> 46:45.803
Oh, do we need an airing
of grievances here?

46:45.837 --> 46:47.572
I just don't want you
to fuck up this case.

46:48.273 --> 46:49.474
How am I gonna do that?

46:49.507 --> 46:51.009
By banging her.

46:52.911 --> 46:54.379
- Fuck.
- Yeah. Yeah.

46:54.412 --> 46:57.315
'Cause this Captain Save-A-Ho
routine, I remember it.

46:57.348 --> 47:00.518
And I remember how sad it was
for you when it turned out I
didn't need saving.

47:05.557 --> 47:07.225
It's always gonna
turn out badly.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.042
Look who it is.

47:24.075 --> 47:26.044
My new best friend.

47:26.077 --> 47:27.312
We need to talk.

47:27.345 --> 47:29.214
Didn't we do that yesterday?

47:30.982 --> 47:32.383
All right.

47:32.417 --> 47:34.085
Gonna have to pay for
some drinks, then.

47:35.887 --> 47:37.455
Get the lady whatever she wants.

47:37.488 --> 47:39.290
Dom Pérignon.

47:42.594 --> 47:44.262
So what's up?

47:45.630 --> 47:47.865
I need to know why Osito
came to see you last night.

47:48.299 --> 47:50.535
- What, are you spying on me?
- Doing my job.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.204
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that.

47:56.441 --> 47:59.110
You know, just when I was
starting to think you were a
nice guy...

47:59.644 --> 48:01.279
But you're not, are you?

48:01.312 --> 48:05.283
You're just a weird, lonely
stalker who has a thing for
strippers.

48:06.284 --> 48:07.952
This isn't a
personal call, Renee.

48:09.020 --> 48:10.088
Why was Osito here?

48:10.121 --> 48:12.123
Because he wanted
a fucking lap dance, all right?

48:12.156 --> 48:14.325
- Did you give him one?
- That's none of your business.

48:14.359 --> 48:16.561
Well, your business
is my business now, Renee.

48:16.594 --> 48:19.631
I need to know why Osito was
here and what you two discussed.

48:19.664 --> 48:21.466
And I need to leave
here 100% reassured

48:21.499 --> 48:23.935
that you did not alert my target
to an ongoing investigation.

48:23.968 --> 48:25.136
Now, can you do that?

48:26.938 --> 48:29.040
You think I'm telling Osito
that I'm talking to a cop?

48:31.976 --> 48:33.911
You know what Frankie would do
if he found out?

48:34.445 --> 48:36.981
He'd fucking kill me, all right?

48:37.448 --> 48:40.218
So, no, I didn't tell him shit.

48:40.251 --> 48:42.220
I don't give a fuck
if you believe me, all right?

48:42.253 --> 48:43.521
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

48:44.689 --> 48:46.491
Is that what you
said to Sherry Henry?

48:50.061 --> 48:51.663
Go fuck yourself, Ray.

48:51.696 --> 48:52.697
We're done.

48:54.198 --> 48:56.234
All right, we're gonna step it
up here at Xavier's.

48:56.267 --> 48:59.170
Let's welcome Candy
to the main stage.

49:21.526 --> 49:23.027
Yeah, I think it's right here.

49:24.228 --> 49:26.431
What are you doing here, again?

49:26.464 --> 49:28.166
Don't worry about it.

49:28.199 --> 49:29.367
I'll call you later.

49:30.635 --> 49:31.636
Sure.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.054
Yeah?

49:50.088 --> 49:52.390
Hi. My name's Jackie.

49:52.423 --> 49:55.426
I'm a friend of Sherry's.
Is it cool if I come in?

49:55.460 --> 49:57.095
You holding?

49:57.128 --> 49:58.563
What?

49:58.596 --> 50:01.065
Oh, no. God, no. I'm sorry.

50:03.201 --> 50:04.702
Cute baby.

50:07.305 --> 50:08.606
Who are you, again?

50:09.374 --> 50:10.742
I'm a friend of Sherry's.

50:11.743 --> 50:13.378
I know her through Ronnie.

50:13.411 --> 50:14.412
Ronnie's cool.

50:15.146 --> 50:17.248
Yeah, yeah. Ronnie's cool.

50:22.153 --> 50:23.621
Can you take her?

50:23.654 --> 50:25.123
I need a smoke.

50:25.156 --> 50:26.491
Yeah, okay.

50:26.524 --> 50:27.525
Sure.

50:36.467 --> 50:37.769
What's her name?

50:39.170 --> 50:40.271
Bella.

50:43.508 --> 50:47.111
So it really sucks
about Sherry, huh?

50:47.145 --> 50:48.379
Yeah.

50:48.413 --> 50:49.680
Sherry was cool.

50:49.714 --> 50:52.450
So do you know her
friend Krista, too?

50:52.483 --> 50:53.818
Who?

50:54.051 --> 50:55.286
Krista.

50:55.319 --> 50:57.388
Sherry's friend, blonde girl?

50:57.422 --> 50:58.423
Freckles?

50:58.456 --> 51:01.392
No, I don't know her.

51:03.127 --> 51:05.196
You're wearing her earrings.

51:06.564 --> 51:08.065
Yeah.

51:08.099 --> 51:09.467
Yeah, I forgot.

51:10.535 --> 51:12.236
Yeah, she was here.

51:12.270 --> 51:14.806
Oh, yeah? With Sherry?

51:16.574 --> 51:18.743
She just got out of rehab.

51:18.776 --> 51:20.411
It's like, go fuck
yourself, you know?

51:20.445 --> 51:23.381
Wait, so she was staying here,
like, what, a couple weeks ago?

51:23.414 --> 51:25.683
'Cause I been trying to call
her, you know?

51:25.716 --> 51:27.418
Who was staying here?

51:27.452 --> 51:29.587
Krista, Sherry's friend.

51:30.321 --> 51:31.622
Shut the fuck up, Lisa.

51:31.656 --> 51:33.191
- I never saw her here.
- You shut up.

51:33.224 --> 51:35.159
You're fucking retarded.

51:36.794 --> 51:38.429
Who are you?

51:38.463 --> 51:39.864
I'm a friend of Sherry's.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.732
You're a friend of Sherry's?

51:41.766 --> 51:43.334
Yeah.

51:43.367 --> 51:44.602
You a cop?

51:44.635 --> 51:47.171
- No.
- I wouldn't let a cop in.

51:47.205 --> 51:48.706
She knows Ronnie.

51:48.739 --> 51:50.408
So why are you here?

51:50.441 --> 51:52.310
You know, I think
she might be hungry.

51:52.343 --> 51:53.644
You want to nurse
her or something?

51:53.678 --> 51:55.847
She doesn't want anything that
comes out of those skank-ass
tits.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.348
Fuck off, Rory.

51:57.381 --> 51:59.116
What are you, a fucking snitch?

51:59.150 --> 52:00.518
- What?
- You wearing a wire?

52:00.551 --> 52:01.752
No. I told you,
I'm a friend of Sherry's, okay?

52:01.786 --> 52:02.787
And Ronnie.

52:02.820 --> 52:04.322
Shut the fuck up, Lisa!

52:04.355 --> 52:06.691
And do something with
this fucking baby!

52:06.724 --> 52:08.392
Hey, you know what?
I'm just gonna go.

52:08.426 --> 52:09.527
I'm gonna go, okay?

52:43.895 --> 52:46.597
You have reached the
CCINU voice mail.

52:46.631 --> 52:49.500
- To dial by name directly,
press 1... - Come on. Fuck you.

52:49.534 --> 52:52.436
...or wait for the tone to leave
a message in our general
mailbox.

52:53.404 --> 52:55.940
Hi, This is Jackie Quinones.
I'm the one who found Sherry
Henry.

52:56.173 --> 52:58.643
Please tell Ray Abruzzo
to call me back.

53:11.422 --> 53:12.857
Hey, you got a second?

53:13.591 --> 53:14.792
Jack, what's up? What
are you doing here?

53:14.825 --> 53:16.594
I was right. She
was fucking there.

53:16.627 --> 53:17.828
Who was where?

53:17.862 --> 53:19.664
Krista, Sherry's
friend. She was there.

53:19.697 --> 53:21.632
She was at Sherry's house
the day of the murder.

53:21.666 --> 53:23.968
And they were wearing the same
necklaces. They lied to me.

53:24.201 --> 53:25.403
They said that she wasn't,
but she was there,

53:25.436 --> 53:26.704
'cause the chick was wearing
the orange earrings.

53:26.737 --> 53:29.373
And I called her,
and her phone was disconnected.

53:29.407 --> 53:31.842
- I know something's up, man.
- This shit again.

53:31.876 --> 53:32.944
I think she's dead, Junior.

53:32.977 --> 53:34.645
I fucking think
the same people killed her.

53:34.679 --> 53:37.315
And if they didn't kill her,
then she's in big fucking
trouble.

53:38.950 --> 53:42.353
All right, look, why don't you
come on board and we'll talk
about it, yeah?

53:42.386 --> 53:43.821
Yeah, okay, all right.

53:43.854 --> 53:45.790
I'll give you a hand.
Watch your step.
