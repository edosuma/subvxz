I returned the first round

12:00.487 --> 12:04.105
Yeah,
but we gotta celebrate, too.

12:04.207 --> 12:07.575
[laughs] they deserve this
today and charley's pulling
out all the stops at her place

12:07.661 --> 12:09.077
and it should
be really lovely.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.228
Well, you look gorgeous.

12:12.249 --> 12:13.581
I do?

12:13.667 --> 12:15.133
I'll happily say it again.

12:17.254 --> 12:18.253
You look gorgeous.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.842
Call me when you get back.

12:23.927 --> 12:25.593
-Can you bring me a vi's pie?
-Uh, really?

12:25.679 --> 12:27.979
Please, any slice,
I'll take it.

12:28.098 --> 12:29.431
Wanna come get some yourself?

12:31.435 --> 12:35.153
I... Yeah. Yeah, I would.

12:37.908 --> 12:39.407
Good. Okay.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.730
-[hollywood] hey.
-Hi.

12:45.849 --> 12:46.848
[violet laughs]

12:46.933 --> 12:48.216
-wood!
-Hey, micah.

12:48.318 --> 12:49.567
-Come see these for me?
-Yeah, I got you.

12:49.686 --> 12:53.605
Ah, okay, so I...
I have the, uh,
clothes pins for the game.

12:53.690 --> 12:57.075
-Perfect.
-And, I know you told me
not to bake or cook,

12:57.194 --> 13:00.728
but, uh, I had to make
my baby boy blue's
favorite pie.

13:00.831 --> 13:02.197
Pies, I see.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.532
Yeah, well, you know,
he likes everything she makes,

13:04.618 --> 13:07.335
-so she went ahead
and made everything.
-[micah and charley laugh]

13:08.205 --> 13:09.704
he has not been here
for a long time

13:09.790 --> 13:11.790
and he should not
have to choose.

13:11.875 --> 13:15.593
You know what?
You are very right,
he should not.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.011
-Lord.
-Oh!

13:17.097 --> 13:18.713
-[violet laughs]
-oh!

13:18.799 --> 13:22.383
You can make anything upscale,
don't you?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.752
Yeah,
you really outdid yourself
this time, charley.

13:24.855 --> 13:26.137
Darla's gonna love this.

13:26.223 --> 13:29.023
-Well, she deserves it.
Doesn't she?
-She certainly does, yeah.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.758
That girl has gone
through a lot.

13:30.861 --> 13:33.278
We should make this day
extra special for her.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.314
-And ralph angel.
-[chuckles] true.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.982
[charley and hollywood laugh]

13:38.068 --> 13:40.401
-[hollywood] let me see
about that champagne.
-[hollywood and violet laugh]

13:43.690 --> 13:45.890
I mean, your papi used
to do this all the time.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.261
Sometimes we talk and...

13:51.832 --> 13:55.416
Other times, we...
Barely say anything.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.536
Pops, you can tell me.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.872
I'm getting bigger now.

14:02.592 --> 14:05.844
What's going on?
What are those boxes for?

14:06.930 --> 14:10.732
Are we selling stuff?
Was the harvest bad?

14:12.419 --> 14:17.305
Remember that one time
we was at the playground?
We had the churros?

14:17.407 --> 14:19.157
Me, you and kenya?

14:19.259 --> 14:21.109
-[ralph angel] yeah.
-I remember.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.427
[ralph angel chuckles]

14:22.529 --> 14:25.897
-there was a basketball game.
-[ralph angel] that's right.

14:27.868 --> 14:31.035
I remember you ran
across the street
to the liquor store.

14:32.439 --> 14:36.124
-You had told me--
-watch the game.
Count the plays.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.911
Five plays and then,
I can have a churro.

14:40.814 --> 14:43.514
I remember
I was a little scared.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.887
Even though you were
just across the street.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.805
Well, that's 'cause I never
should've left you.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.892
I know that now and I'm sorry.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.979
You know, sometimes in life...

15:00.116 --> 15:03.067
Things will happen,
make you get desperate.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.071
Now, desperation, that's...

15:08.909 --> 15:10.074
Doing things out of fear.

15:11.962 --> 15:13.828
We can't live like that,
you know?

15:14.965 --> 15:16.047
[blue] yeah.

15:16.166 --> 15:16.998
To be honest...

15:19.002 --> 15:21.886
I hate to admit
that I've been living
like that far too long.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.558
I don't want that
for you, son.
You understand me?

15:28.511 --> 15:29.394
Okay.

15:31.147 --> 15:35.199
When I gave you
blue's corner...
I had a vision.

15:37.170 --> 15:43.074
Saw you dreaming, planting.
Doing whatever you wanted.

15:45.862 --> 15:46.861
And I messed up.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.199
'cause I was acting desperate.

15:53.586 --> 15:58.623
I did something
to, you know, put some money,
money in our pockets, but...

16:02.045 --> 16:03.544
I went about it the wrong way.

16:05.548 --> 16:09.467
I was acting desperate
and now I gotta pay
the consequence.

16:13.139 --> 16:17.976
That being said,
we may have to leave the farm.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.045
For a little bit.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.413
Away from our land?

16:24.067 --> 16:25.233
Just for a little while.

16:27.037 --> 16:28.286
But this is home.

16:32.876 --> 16:33.741
I know.

16:40.333 --> 16:44.752
Ralph angel! Blue!
It's time to go now.

16:53.096 --> 16:57.098
Hey.
It's gonna be okay, all right?

16:58.018 --> 16:59.934
-Okay.
-Just take care of mama today.

17:01.071 --> 17:02.603
-Yes, sir.
-All right?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.272
-You got me?
-I got you.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.752
So we stopped at the
black lives matter plaza

17:17.837 --> 17:19.987
and it was so cool
to see in person.

17:20.090 --> 17:22.173
And I went
with my best friend ian.

17:22.292 --> 17:25.493
-Your best friend?
-Yeah, best friend.

17:25.595 --> 17:31.599
Our project on mesopotamia
won first place
in our ancient history class.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.685
And it reminded me
of our community
because we really talked

17:34.804 --> 17:38.839
about how the specialized
skills that the workers
cultivated

17:38.942 --> 17:40.725
really built
the civilization there.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.676
-Liked to hear more of that.
-[charley laughs]

17:42.779 --> 17:44.345
blue, you are just
as wonderful

17:44.447 --> 17:46.364
as your aunt violet
always says.

17:46.483 --> 17:49.067
-I think she's pretty
nice, too.
-[violet laughs]

17:49.152 --> 17:52.070
-oh, I missed you, so much.
-[blue] me, too.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.037
[violet chuckles]

17:59.329 --> 18:00.328
-hey.
-Hey.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.832
-I missed you so much.
-[laughing] I missed you.

18:04.918 --> 18:08.302
-Micah, uh, this is my friend
and neighbor, dominic.
-What's up, man?

18:08.388 --> 18:11.472
Dominic, this is micah, the,
my oldest of my two nephews.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.559
He's a student at xavier
and a budding photographer.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.477
-Nice.
-Good to meet you, man.
Welcome.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.429
-[dominic] thank you,
it's good to be here.
-Yes, of course.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.014
Hey!

18:20.100 --> 18:21.566
Hey! [grunts] oh, my god.

18:21.684 --> 18:24.051
[laughing] you've gotten
so big, I can barely
lift you anymore.

18:24.154 --> 18:27.605
Dominic, this is
my other nephew,
the brilliant blue borderlon.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.407
This is for you.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.359
Hi. Here is your clothespin.

18:31.444 --> 18:35.279
So, this is a standard
baby shower game.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.198
So, you wear this clothespin.

18:37.283 --> 18:40.618
And, when you do,
you cannot cross
your arms or your legs.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.955
If you do, someone can take
this clothespin right off you.

18:44.040 --> 18:47.125
And whoever has
the most clothespins
at the end of the game wins.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.377
I assume you're
really good at this.

18:50.513 --> 18:53.080
Hey everybody. Hey. Hi.

18:53.183 --> 18:56.083
Uh, this is dominic. Make him
feel at home.

18:56.186 --> 18:57.084
-Hello.
-Hey.

18:57.187 --> 18:58.719
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.022
Well, welcome, baby.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.440
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

19:03.977 --> 19:07.612
-What up, big brah.
-Robin, nice to meet you.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.198
Hey, congratulations.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.650
-Nice to meet you, brother.
-I'll get you a couple glasses
of wine.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.235
Oh, thank you.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.487
-Uh, hello handsome.
-Yes, isn't he.

19:16.573 --> 19:17.938
Yeah, he is.

19:18.024 --> 19:21.325
I know I've,
uh, been out of town
for a while, but

19:21.411 --> 19:22.660
how'd I miss this news?

19:22.762 --> 19:25.163
It's not quite news yet.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.297
Do you want it to be?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.916
I think I do.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.218
[nova] but we'll see.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.802
Taking things slow.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.921
-For a change.
-[both laugh]

19:39.512 --> 19:43.181
alright. Good afternoon,
family, friends.

19:43.266 --> 19:47.101
We, uh, just wanna thank you
for being here today.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.820
A big thank you
to charley and micah

19:49.939 --> 19:52.973
for hosting us. [laughs]

19:53.076 --> 19:54.992
I, uh, I cannot express

19:55.111 --> 19:56.861
what it means to us

19:56.946 --> 19:58.996
to share this beautiful space
with you today.

20:00.283 --> 20:02.200
[darla] I look at each
and every one of you.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.035
My heart bursts

20:04.120 --> 20:06.754
with memories [sighs softly]
of your support of us.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.677
Mr. Prosper.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.630
You have been
my link to mr. Ernest.

20:15.715 --> 20:19.050
Teaching me all about him
through your remembrances
and stories.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.186
Nova.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.439
You helped us
through schooling

20:25.525 --> 20:27.642
and community engagement,

20:27.727 --> 20:30.895
keeping him tuned in
to our history and legacy
as a people.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.683
[darla] charley.

20:35.785 --> 20:37.668
You have been a champion
for me

20:38.871 --> 20:40.738
and an inspiration to me

20:41.824 --> 20:43.040
in so many ways.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.712
It's difficult
to say how much.

20:49.299 --> 20:50.381
But just know that.

20:54.554 --> 20:55.553
[darla] vi.

20:59.842 --> 21:00.725
Not only

21:01.844 --> 21:02.977
did you raise blue

21:05.181 --> 21:06.130
when we couldn't,

21:10.103 --> 21:11.202
but you were there for me,

21:13.156 --> 21:14.188
more recently,

21:16.159 --> 21:18.276
in ways that pulled me back
from the edge

21:20.196 --> 21:21.696
so that I can stand here now.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.484
[darla sighs softly]

21:28.755 --> 21:30.037
and hollywood.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.825
[voice shaking] hollywood.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.546
Most people

21:40.466 --> 21:41.499
probably don't know

21:43.386 --> 21:45.102
how I feel about you.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.923
How you single-handedly

21:50.026 --> 21:51.225
tracked me down

21:52.679 --> 21:54.578
and saved me from myself

21:56.382 --> 21:57.648
in my darkest hour.

22:00.453 --> 22:01.786
[whispers] thank you forever.

22:02.655 --> 22:03.521
[darla sniffles]

22:05.908 --> 22:06.741
I love you all.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.626
[laughs sheepishly]

22:08.745 --> 22:10.745
-we love you all.
-That's right.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.331
And we thank you

22:13.416 --> 22:14.765
[inhales]

22:14.884 --> 22:16.000
for this day

22:17.720 --> 22:19.036
and for all of the days.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.505
[all applauding]

22:31.017 --> 22:31.899
[indistinct conversation]

22:32.018 --> 22:33.317
whose that, mr. Blue?

22:33.403 --> 22:35.703
-That is my teacher
miss finley.
-Mm-hm.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.705
She is so cool.

22:37.807 --> 22:39.774
She reminds me of aunt vi.

22:39.859 --> 22:43.327
That's nice. It sounds like
you havin' the time
of your life here in dc, blue.

22:43.413 --> 22:44.745
I am.

22:44.847 --> 22:48.332
I love all the new people
I'm meeting
and everything I'm learning.

22:48.418 --> 22:49.834
We'd love to see it.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.237
Excuse me, mr. Benny.

22:53.339 --> 22:54.955
Hi, mr. Prosper.

22:56.092 --> 22:57.041
I'm sorry. [laughs sheepishly]

22:58.344 --> 23:00.094
but you just
crossed your legs.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.212
[all laughing]

23:04.550 --> 23:08.018
so, I'm gonna have
to take that clothespin
from you.

23:08.104 --> 23:09.586
[clears throat] let me slide?

23:09.689 --> 23:11.639
I'm afraid not.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.590
Rules are rules.

23:13.693 --> 23:14.892
Clothespin.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.061
Thank you.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.312
Don't be
a poor loser, prosper.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.266
You just hang on
to that, okay?

23:22.368 --> 23:23.901
[all chuckling]

23:23.986 --> 23:26.436
[billie] you went by what?
Ten, twelve times?

23:26.539 --> 23:27.488
-More like 20.
-[billie laughs]

23:27.573 --> 23:29.290
-we were wild.
-[billie laughs]

23:29.408 --> 23:31.158
-sounds like it.
-[both women laugh]

23:32.411 --> 23:35.129
I'm really glad, uh,
that you're back here.

23:35.248 --> 23:37.248
Back in st. Joe,
even if for a little while.

23:37.333 --> 23:40.951
Yeah, well, uh, a little while
might end up being
a little longer.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.419
Daddy wants me to move back.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.390
Things are
a little complicated
back home.

23:46.476 --> 23:49.393
Just trying
to figure things out.

23:49.479 --> 23:52.096
Why can't things be simple?
Like when we were young.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.515
Ooh, young, dumb,
couldn't tell us nothin'.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.983
[both women laugh]

23:56.102 --> 23:58.635
you remember all that stuff
we did out in the farm?

23:58.738 --> 24:00.905
I kissed a boy
for the first time.

24:00.990 --> 24:02.523
-We had our first drink.
-[groans]

24:02.608 --> 24:04.808
that's what I'm talkin' about.
This is news I can use.

24:04.911 --> 24:07.411
-We got so drunk.
-[laughs] we threw up.

24:07.497 --> 24:08.746
-I remember.
-[billie laughs]

24:08.831 --> 24:10.614
I think to this day it's
why I don't like gin.

24:10.700 --> 24:11.949
[both laughing]

24:12.952 --> 24:15.169
yeah, if this farmland
could talk.

24:16.706 --> 24:17.621
It can.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.674
You just have to speak
its language.

24:22.011 --> 24:22.960
[nova] and you speak it.

24:23.796 --> 24:24.845
It will come back to you.

24:26.182 --> 24:27.298
Thank you, nova.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.101
-So glad you came today.
-I am, too.

24:34.023 --> 24:34.889
[billie laughs]

24:38.361 --> 24:39.226
[indistinct conversation]

24:43.282 --> 24:46.650
what are you ladies doing
out here? The party's inside.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.185
Ol' darla was just, uh,

24:48.287 --> 24:52.156
explaining her current
sleeping arrangements.

24:52.241 --> 24:53.657
The floor.

24:54.744 --> 24:56.210
The what? [laughs]

24:56.329 --> 25:00.197
so, I have finally convinced
ralphie and joe to sleep
on the floor with me.

25:00.299 --> 25:03.584
I mean, it's, it's
the only way I can
get comfortable these days.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.252
-I have so been there.
-Really?

25:05.338 --> 25:08.672
Oh, yeah. My third trimester
there was this certain chair.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.808
That was the only thing
that I could sleep in.

25:10.893 --> 25:15.379
Oh, my, okay, fantastic.
I mean, it's like no one
understands it.

25:15.481 --> 25:18.849
-[charley] yeah.
-But only the moms get it.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.569
[charley chuckles] totally.

25:23.489 --> 25:24.355
[charley laughs]

25:25.491 --> 25:26.523
[exhales]

25:26.609 --> 25:29.526
not, not just the moms.

25:29.612 --> 25:30.945
Oh, it's okay baby.
[laughs nervously]

25:32.365 --> 25:34.448
I'll tell you what.
I am gonna go back inside

25:34.533 --> 25:38.002
and let you two discuss
all that good stuff.

25:40.423 --> 25:43.157
[prosper] what you did,
you mislead people.

25:43.259 --> 25:44.158
-No.
-Yes, you did.

25:44.260 --> 25:47.294
-I told--
-yes, you did, yes, you did!

25:47.380 --> 25:48.596
[indistinct shouting]

25:52.051 --> 25:53.183
[all laughing]

25:57.556 --> 25:59.723
-you cheated.
-I did not.

25:59.809 --> 26:02.142
[hollywood] your shoe strings
were crossed, all right?

26:02.228 --> 26:05.262
[blue] that doesn't
mean a thing.
I said arms, legs.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.847
[hollywood] and shoe strings
and eyes.

26:06.949 --> 26:09.650
-[blue] wait.
-[all laughing]

26:09.735 --> 26:10.734
[blue] shoe string!

26:17.576 --> 26:20.711
There you are. You just left.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.296
I didn't think anybody
would notice.

26:25.418 --> 26:27.835
-How are you?
-I'm good.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.475
Come on. Talk to me.
It's just us.

26:35.745 --> 26:36.760
Whassup?

26:42.101 --> 26:44.318
I don't really know how
to put it into words

26:44.437 --> 26:47.604
because I haven't really
fully-formed it in my head.
You know?

26:48.908 --> 26:49.740
Just...

26:51.944 --> 26:54.311
I don't know. I'm confused.

26:54.413 --> 26:56.613
I had a relationship
with a friend

26:57.950 --> 26:59.366
and... I don't know
what to do.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.303
Maybe an objective ear
can help.

27:03.589 --> 27:04.772
I... [laughs nervously]

27:08.627 --> 27:11.345
I have a friend at school

27:11.464 --> 27:14.715
who is probably
the best friend
I've ever had.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.634
Just, like, what you would
think of when you thin
of a best friend. You know?

27:18.554 --> 27:19.636
What we want in a friendship.

27:19.722 --> 27:21.805
Camaraderie. It's the trust.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.507
The laughs.

27:23.609 --> 27:25.859
We learn from each other.
It's really cool.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.445
But...

27:30.433 --> 27:34.902
Something has come up
in the friendship
that's been unexpected.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.823
It's intimacy.

27:42.211 --> 27:48.165
You know, not like sex
or romance.
Just intimacy of emotion.

27:50.252 --> 27:54.388
I wanna tell him everything.
I... [stammers and laughs]

27:54.507 --> 27:58.542
wanna hang with him
all the time. I just feel
genuinely connected to him.

27:58.644 --> 28:04.815
You know? And [exhales]
some people have noticed
that, and...

28:07.470 --> 28:10.687
I let that change
the relationship. Because--

28:10.773 --> 28:14.908
-because you wonder what
the intimacy means.
-Yeah. Like...

28:15.745 --> 28:19.446
Straight up: Am I gay?
Am I fluid?

28:22.034 --> 28:25.986
These are all
new thoughts for me. [exhales]

28:27.706 --> 28:33.410
I hear you.
It's a confusing time
for you. But--

28:33.512 --> 28:36.430
[inhales] you don't have
to let it be
a distressing time.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.015
As in, you don't have
to pin this down

28:38.100 --> 28:42.719
or define yourself forever
right now. Or any time soon.

28:44.473 --> 28:48.108
Or maybe you're putting
too much stress
on the question right now.

28:48.210 --> 28:53.063
Maybe think of this time
as not a question at all.
Maybe think of this time

28:53.149 --> 28:56.200
-as a discovery.
-Mmm. Discovery.

28:56.285 --> 29:00.037
Just continue following
your feelings.
Don't lead your feelings.

29:00.122 --> 29:03.190
Let your feelings lead you.
See where they take you.
Don't stress.

29:03.292 --> 29:05.659
Don't plan. Don't anticipate.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.212
I find that
that kind of clutter
in your mind produces

29:08.297 --> 29:11.114
-false results, you know?
-Yeah. I'm forcing it--

29:11.217 --> 29:13.750
-yes.
-[mutters] forcing it.

29:13.836 --> 29:18.338
I mean, listen.
The story of you is new
each day.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.424
Unfolding each day
for all of us.

29:21.811 --> 29:24.478
There's a problem
with this whole world.
This whole construct.

29:24.597 --> 29:27.964
Half the time, we're trying
to fit into a definition
we've given ourselves

29:28.067 --> 29:29.933
or that others have given us.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.024
I love what you said.
That, like--

29:38.160 --> 29:41.078
you know, follow my feelings.
Don't let them follow me.

29:44.900 --> 29:45.866
Yeah.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.453
Thank you.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.008
I got you, kid.

30:02.551 --> 30:03.967
Always.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.721
-I love you.
-I love you.

30:16.749 --> 30:20.634
See, black people.
We always been resourceful.

30:20.753 --> 30:26.056
And what they do?
They take it. Diamonds.
Oil. Land. Life.

30:26.141 --> 30:28.075
-That's 'cause we got
something they want.
-Always.

30:28.177 --> 30:30.677
We have something
they don't ever have.

30:30.763 --> 30:34.181
You know
they hate our spirit.
Our strength. Our joy--

30:34.266 --> 30:36.683
-sure enough, yes they do.
-[ralph angel] that's 'cause
they ain't got it.

30:36.769 --> 30:40.404
They try so hard to make us
think that we less than.
But we not.

30:40.489 --> 30:44.775
I mean, your ways of thinking.
You know, lay the groundwork.
Tell them the idea.

30:46.745 --> 30:49.196
So, idea's for a co-op.
We stronger together
than we are alone.

30:49.281 --> 30:52.315
But, basically, a co-op
mean we pool
our settlement money

30:52.418 --> 30:55.085
instead of us each having
our own little potatoes,
paying off this and that.

30:55.170 --> 30:58.705
We move past that. One farm.
One crop idea.
We think bigger.

30:58.791 --> 31:02.259
[ralph angel] individually,
we might be able to get
through, what, one harvest?

31:02.344 --> 31:03.710
-[cardale] yeah.
-[ralph angel] maybe two?

31:03.812 --> 31:07.581
But if we put our money
together, maybe we could
get us some control.

31:07.683 --> 31:10.801
And some power.
The whole goal is
to buy up more land

31:10.886 --> 31:13.720
-so we stop living
hand to mouth.
-Wow.

31:13.806 --> 31:16.857
-That's kind of incredible.
-See, I told you none of us
have given up.

31:16.976 --> 31:20.894
Ralph angel presented the idea
to my father couple days ago,
and then dad looped me in.

31:20.980 --> 31:25.015
I did some research
with my firm back in chicago.
Both with your settlement

31:25.117 --> 31:29.653
as a community,
and with the biden-booker
black farmers' rescue plan,

31:29.738 --> 31:32.573
-you all could really
make this work.
-Tell what the plan says.

31:32.658 --> 31:37.160
Any land that should come up
for sale in farming
communities has a first option

31:37.246 --> 31:42.365
for black farmers.
Meaning, if anything should
come up for sale in st. Joe,

31:42.468 --> 31:45.636
each of you would have
the first right to purchase.
[micah] wow.

31:45.721 --> 31:48.672
So you know that outlet mall
that parker and them
was trying to buy?

31:48.757 --> 31:51.808
It fell through
during quarantine. Whole thing
just sitting there.

31:51.894 --> 31:53.393
-[benny] that's good land
over there.
-[cardale] mmm-hmm.

31:53.512 --> 31:56.563
-It surely is.
-Yeah. Now I mean,
we can't do this alone.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.932
-[ralph angel] mmm.
-But ralph's idea, we can do
this together.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.550
-Yeah.
-[prosper] you know?

32:00.653 --> 32:02.603
[scoffs] wasn't my idea,
mr. Prosper.

32:08.444 --> 32:09.443
Something to think about.

32:15.501 --> 32:19.419
Can we think about this later?
Because we've got
a cake to eat,

32:19.538 --> 32:24.391
-and I have more clothespins
to grab. So let's go.
-[all laughing]

32:30.766 --> 32:33.583
[prosper laughs] okay.
[charley] okay.

32:33.686 --> 32:35.135
[cardale] that's your boy.

32:35.220 --> 32:37.104
[ralph angel] that's a nice
little haul, huh?

32:37.222 --> 32:39.189
[darla] everything is
so beautiful.

32:40.275 --> 32:41.558
-I'll take these to the car.
-Okay.

32:41.644 --> 32:42.526
I'll be right back.

32:44.980 --> 32:47.064
-[ralph angel] that big
old bear.
-[blue scoffs]

32:47.149 --> 32:49.599
[ralph angel] bigger than you.
[blue] I don't know
about bigger than me.

32:49.702 --> 32:51.101
[ralph angel chuckles]

32:51.203 --> 32:55.906
you know you can feel free
to just leave your gifts
in the garage here.

32:55.991 --> 32:58.492
I mean, I know
you're packing and...

32:58.577 --> 33:01.828
Isn't all this new stuff
just gonna give you
more to do?

33:01.914 --> 33:08.969
Yes, but, uh. I kind of like
to take everything out
and just see it, you know.

33:09.088 --> 33:14.641
We're doing the best we can,
but, sometimes, it's nice
to reduce and declutter,

33:14.760 --> 33:19.563
and... Honestly,
with the space we got,
we really don't have a choice.

33:19.648 --> 33:20.564
So...

33:24.787 --> 33:28.772
-We don't want to meddle.
-We really don't.

33:28.857 --> 33:32.726
I'm not trying to get
in you all's business anymore.
[chuckles] you know?

33:32.828 --> 33:36.279
That's why I haven't said
anything until now.
I'm trying hard

33:36.365 --> 33:38.281
to turn over a new leaf
with ralph angel.

33:40.252 --> 33:45.639
You all are grown,
and I respect your choices
as adults and parents.

33:45.741 --> 33:50.177
-I support you.
-Absolutely. We both do.

33:50.295 --> 33:53.613
And that is why
we just wanna offer some help.

33:53.716 --> 33:55.966
I got a extra room.
Now, you know that.

33:56.935 --> 33:59.936
And blue is on his way
back to school.

34:00.022 --> 34:03.557
That room is large enough
and lovely enough
for the two of you

34:03.642 --> 34:08.562
and the baby. I can keep you
in homecooked meals,
help you with the baby

34:08.647 --> 34:15.152
if you need it. That way,
you don't have to pay no rent.
You can save up.

34:15.237 --> 34:18.939
-Make a real plan.
-It's a terrific option
for you.

34:19.041 --> 34:21.441
And I'm gonna add another one.

34:21.543 --> 34:25.545
I'm gonna be gone
over the next year quite a bit
for my campaign.

34:25.664 --> 34:29.666
You can stay here.
Micah's gonna be back
at the dorms. [laughs]

34:29.752 --> 34:32.836
this place is gonna be sitting
empty, basically.

34:34.957 --> 34:39.893
Whatever you decide,
we just want you to know
that we're here for you.

34:40.846 --> 34:45.348
You're not alone. Okay?

34:46.351 --> 34:49.236
It's just-- thank you.

34:50.639 --> 34:53.073
[chuckles] we love you.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.242
We do.

34:56.145 --> 34:58.829
-[violet chuckling]
-[laughs]

34:59.615 --> 35:01.665
-[violet] mmm.
-[charley laughs]

35:07.372 --> 35:08.705
-ahem.
-Thank you.

35:08.791 --> 35:09.673
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

35:09.758 --> 35:11.074
[giggling]

35:11.176 --> 35:13.627
I can't believe
your students turned
this around so fast today.

35:13.712 --> 35:15.295
Yeah. This is what we do.

35:15.380 --> 35:18.381
We have special access
to the collections at both
xavier and tulane's libraries,

35:18.467 --> 35:19.599
so once they knew
what we were looking for,

35:19.718 --> 35:20.934
they zeroed in
on what we needed.

35:21.053 --> 35:22.219
Okay.

35:22.304 --> 35:23.220
What we got?

35:25.390 --> 35:27.140
More evidence came in.

35:27.242 --> 35:28.975
The bones match markers
similar to the remains

35:29.061 --> 35:30.977
at the thibodaux, louisiana
massacre.

35:31.063 --> 35:32.813
In 1887?

35:32.898 --> 35:33.763
Yeah. That's right.

35:33.866 --> 35:34.614
You know about it.

35:34.733 --> 35:35.816
I remember reading
about the history

35:35.901 --> 35:37.767
of local black farmers
trying to join the union,

35:37.870 --> 35:39.119
when I was researching
my book.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.271
They were murdered
and massacred.

35:41.373 --> 35:43.540
By angry white farm owners.

35:43.625 --> 35:44.541
As always.

35:45.627 --> 35:47.744
But, thibodaux is 50 miles
from st. Joe.

35:47.830 --> 35:50.446
Yes. Yes. Except,

35:50.549 --> 35:56.002
multiple massacre has resulted
in unmarked burials
in multiple regions.

35:56.088 --> 36:00.056
So, it's not unlikely
that lesser-developed land
was designated--

36:00.142 --> 36:01.975
-as a mass grave.
-Exactly.

36:03.762 --> 36:06.680
[keyboard clacking]

36:11.737 --> 36:12.853
that cemetery
you mentioned,

36:12.938 --> 36:15.305
when we were on our road-trip
to sweet orchard?

36:15.390 --> 36:18.942
It's in the process
of being registered
as a historical site.

36:19.027 --> 36:21.278
Can we do something
like that with our land?

36:21.363 --> 36:22.279
Yeah, possibly.

36:22.364 --> 36:24.748
The landry's have always
wanted our land.

36:24.833 --> 36:26.666
They wanted to put
a highway through it.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.201
Put a prison.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.921
But, they can't dig up
these freedom fighters
and my mother,

or an outlet mall, or whatever

36:33.425 --> 36:34.657
twisted bullshit they're into.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.042
This is sacred land.

36:37.129 --> 36:38.211
It always was.

36:39.681 --> 36:41.264
But, even more so now.

36:41.350 --> 36:44.384
We'll need to track down
a contemporaneous record
of the massacre.

36:44.469 --> 36:46.853
-Like, something official
that ties it to the land.
-Hmm.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.722
And we should also look
into the local laws

36:48.807 --> 36:51.558
for registering a landmark
in st. Joe.

36:51.643 --> 36:56.396
Because, if we can prove
historical artifacts,

36:56.481 --> 37:01.017
then there's a chance
it could be designated as land
that can't be built on.

37:01.119 --> 37:02.319
Land that can't be taken.

37:05.457 --> 37:06.456
[ralph sighs]

37:09.661 --> 37:10.660
[door closes]

37:11.663 --> 37:12.662
what's up?

37:30.816 --> 37:31.815
[uplifting music playing]

38:30.075 --> 38:31.875
he asleep yet?

38:31.960 --> 38:34.995
[ralph laughs] he said
he missed his favorite bed.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.463
Because it always
does the trick.

38:37.416 --> 38:38.298
He actually said that?

38:38.417 --> 38:40.967
The things this boy
be saying sometimes.

38:41.086 --> 38:42.419
Sometimes?

38:42.504 --> 38:43.503
All the time.

38:44.506 --> 38:47.140
You know, it's hard not
having it all figured out.

38:47.259 --> 38:48.258
We don't need to.

38:50.078 --> 38:51.227
The answers will come.

38:53.682 --> 38:54.647
You and me together,

38:55.901 --> 38:56.900
we'll find a way.

38:58.887 --> 38:59.769
And when we do,

39:01.106 --> 39:02.188
it's gonna be no stopping us.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.926
Charley offered us
her place to stay.

39:08.830 --> 39:09.863
Aunt vi did too.

39:09.948 --> 39:10.864
Really?

39:12.868 --> 39:14.084
Wow.

39:14.169 --> 39:15.752
[ralph exhales]

39:15.837 --> 39:17.837
I was wondering,
but they never said nothing.

39:19.041 --> 39:21.041
I just figured us,
plus a baby,
was too much.

39:21.126 --> 39:24.427
Hmm. They were lovely

39:25.547 --> 39:26.379
and generous.

39:27.649 --> 39:29.099
Charley said she's gonna
be on the road

39:29.184 --> 39:32.635
and with micah gone,
we'll have the entire place
to ourselves, basically.

39:33.472 --> 39:34.471
So, what do you think?

39:36.475 --> 39:37.891
We could save our money.

39:39.594 --> 39:42.162
Vi offered us
her extra bedroom.

39:43.632 --> 39:46.933
I mean, if you're open to it,

39:47.018 --> 39:49.903
I think it would be
kind of amazing
to have her around.

39:52.441 --> 39:56.693
I'd like as much love,
surrounding this baby,
as possible.

39:59.698 --> 40:03.366
I wasn't really
properly there for blue
when he was an infant.

40:05.921 --> 40:10.457
I would love to have
the help, the guidance.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.176
Guiding hands.

40:27.442 --> 40:29.559
