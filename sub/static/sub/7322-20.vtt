IT'S BEEN YEARS.

09:06.577 --> 09:09.149
THIS TIME NEXT WEEK,
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.982
AND YOUR GRANDKIDS, YOU HAVE--
YOU HAVE GRANDKIDS?

09:11.982 --> 09:15.085
TWO.
THEY'RE NOT GONNA KNOW
WHAT HIT 'EM. (chuckles)

09:15.085 --> 09:18.058
THEY WON'T BE ABLE
TO KEEP UP WITH YOU.
YOU MEAN IT?

09:18.058 --> 09:20.190
I MEAN IT.
HE MEANS IT.

09:20.190 --> 09:22.693
(sneezes) EXCUSE ME.
SORRY.

09:22.693 --> 09:25.265
(whispering) OH, HEY.
COME IN, COME IN, COME IN.
(whispers) NO.

09:25.265 --> 09:29.139
WHY?

09:29.139 --> 09:31.271
(sighs)

09:31.271 --> 09:33.974
OKAY, HOLD IT STEADY.
GREY, GET IN THERE.
(Teddy, nasally voice)
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

09:33.974 --> 09:36.106
OH, MY GOD.
HERE WE GO.

09:36.106 --> 09:37.848
(grunts)
(Meredith)
FISHING BOAT ACCIDENT.

09:37.848 --> 09:39.279
SOMETHING FELL ON HIM.
AND THE HOOK?

09:39.279 --> 09:41.852
LOOKS LIKE HE FELL ON IT.
(monitor beeping erratically)

09:41.852 --> 09:44.114
PRESSURE'S AT 68 SYSTOLIC.
(Teddy) TRACHEAL DEVIATION

09:44.114 --> 09:46.286
AND ABSENT BREATH SOUNDS.
GET ME A 14-GAUGE NEEDLE.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.088
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
DAD.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.960
(grunts)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO HIM?

09:49.960 --> 09:52.092
GREY, GET HIM OUTTA HERE.
I'M TRYING. DOUG, PLEASE.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.625
GO ON, SON.
I'M ALL RIGHT. OH, GOD.

09:54.625 --> 09:57.127
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
DAD, I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

09:57.127 --> 09:59.599
I HAD THE ROPE IN MY HAND
ONE MINUTE, AND--
DOUG, DOUG, COME ON.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.002
NO, I DID THIS. I--
I'M SORRY. DAD, I'M SO SORRY.

10:02.002 --> 10:05.135
IT'S--IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
OF COURSE IT'S HIS FAULT!

10:05.135 --> 10:07.137
I WAS THROWN ON TOP
OF THIS SHARK HOOK

10:07.137 --> 10:09.279
BECAUSE HE LET GO
OF THE ROPE.

10:09.279 --> 10:11.642
WHO THE HELL'S FAULT IS IT?

10:11.642 --> 10:13.984
(Owen) LET'S LEAVE THE HOOK IN
UNTIL WE GET HIM UP TO THE O.R.

10:13.984 --> 10:15.986
I'M FEELING A DEPRESSED
SKULL FRACTURE.

10:15.986 --> 10:18.849
(Derek) ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD
AND ORDER A HEAD C.T.
(April) RIGHT AWAY, CHIEF.

10:18.849 --> 10:20.851
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING
HE TAUGHT ME

10:20.851 --> 10:22.993
WHEN I JOINED THE CREW.

10:22.993 --> 10:25.125
I DON'T KNOW HOW...

10:25.125 --> 10:27.097
(grunts)

10:27.097 --> 10:29.960
WE DIDN'T PLAY BALL
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.232
WE TIED KNOTS. I KNOW
HOW TO TIE THAT KNOT.

10:32.232 --> 10:36.366
DOUG, YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

10:36.366 --> 10:38.338
WHAT IF IT WASN'T?

10:38.338 --> 10:41.041
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
SOMETIMES...

10:41.041 --> 10:44.675
(grunts) HITTING HIM...
OR HURTING HIM.

10:44.675 --> 10:47.647
HE PISSES ME OFF SOMETIMES
AND HE'S HARSH AND--

10:47.647 --> 10:49.820
ARE YOU TELLING US
YOU DID THIS ON PURPOSE?

10:49.820 --> 10:52.022
NO, NOT ON PURPOSE.
I JUST...

10:52.022 --> 10:54.955
(grunts) I DON'T--
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.187
OKAY, JUST TRY TO RELAX.
DEEP BREATHS.

10:57.187 --> 11:00.030
DEEP BREATHS.

11:00.030 --> 11:01.391
(vomits)
(gasps)

11:01.391 --> 11:04.164
OKAY, UH, GREY, ORDER A HEAD
C.T. AND GET A C.T. ANGIO.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.437
I THINK I SAW, UH,
SOME FLUID AROUND HIS SPLEEN.

11:07.437 --> 11:10.741
I'LL DO IT.
UH, I THINK THERE'S SOME--

11:10.741 --> 11:15.175
AND I'LL JUST
DEAL WITH THE VOMIT.

11:17.047 --> 11:20.150
SO, UM, THE NURSE SAYS
I'M BEING DISCHARGED?

11:20.150 --> 11:22.352
I HAVE TO LEAVE TOMORROW?

11:22.352 --> 11:24.354
I JUST HAD THE BABY,
LIKE, TODAY.

11:24.354 --> 11:27.057
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD THING.
IT MEANS YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

11:27.057 --> 11:29.019
NO COMPLICATIONS.

11:29.019 --> 11:30.360
RIGHT, LITTLE MAN?

11:30.360 --> 11:33.323
WELL, WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO GO?
MY MOM KICKED ME OUT,

11:33.323 --> 11:36.096
AND THOSE FRIENDS I WAS STAYING
WITH IN PORTLAND WERE LIKE,

11:36.096 --> 11:38.969
"YOU GOTTA PAY RENT
OR YOU GOTTA LEAVE"...

11:38.969 --> 11:42.432
(yawns)
AND... I CAN'T PAY RENT.
I DON'T HAVE A JOB.

11:42.432 --> 11:44.875
(coos)
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

11:44.875 --> 11:46.406
YOU CAN STAY WITH ME.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.178
REALLY?

11:48.178 --> 11:51.211
SURE. JUST UNTIL
YOU FIGURE THINGS OUT.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.213
(inhales deeply)

11:53.213 --> 11:56.416
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
SLOANS ARE TOUGH.

11:56.416 --> 12:00.190
YOU HEAR THAT?
WE'RE TOUGH.

12:00.190 --> 12:02.492
(baby coos)
UM...

12:02.492 --> 12:07.157
MAYBE WE SHOULD...
KEEP HIM.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.462
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD?

12:12.462 --> 12:15.205
MAYBE.

12:17.367 --> 12:19.169
YOU WANT TO HOLD HIM?

12:19.169 --> 12:22.142
NO. I... I DON'T THINK
I KNOW HOW TO--

12:22.142 --> 12:26.246
DO YOU WANT TO HOLD HIM?
HE'S PRETTY GREAT.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.118
(whispers) LOOK WHO IT IS.

12:28.118 --> 12:29.419
HI, BABY.

12:29.419 --> 12:32.252
(coos)

12:32.252 --> 12:34.284
(normal voice)
LOOK AT THAT.

12:34.284 --> 12:37.287
YOU'RE A NATURAL.

12:37.287 --> 12:39.329
IT'S UP TO YOU.

12:39.329 --> 12:42.062
IF YOU THINK WE CAN DO THIS,

12:42.062 --> 12:43.864
RAISE HIM...

12:43.864 --> 12:45.135
TOGETHER...

12:45.135 --> 12:48.438
IF YOU THINK WE CAN, THEN...

12:48.438 --> 12:50.801
HEY, GUYS.

12:50.801 --> 12:53.073
HE REALLY NEEDS TO GO
TO THE NURSERY TO BE MONITORED

12:53.073 --> 12:54.374
AND GET HIS NEWBORN CHECKUP.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.546
I'M MONITORING,
AND I DID THE EXAMS.

12:56.546 --> 12:58.278
HE'S ALL GOOD.

12:58.278 --> 13:02.082
(baby fussing)

13:02.082 --> 13:06.156
MARK, WHEN YOU GET A MINUTE,
I'D LOVE TO HAVE A QUICK WORD.

13:06.156 --> 13:09.860
(fussing continues)

13:09.860 --> 13:12.222
(Richard) HMM.
CAUGHT A BIG ONE, HUH?

13:12.222 --> 13:13.924
THAT'S FUNNY.

13:13.924 --> 13:15.795
HE'S GOT A SMALL HEMATOMA.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.968
HEY, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

13:17.968 --> 13:19.499
WHY DID YOU HIRE ALTMAN?

13:19.499 --> 13:21.371
WHAT'D YOU SEE IN HER?

13:21.371 --> 13:23.373
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SEE IN HER?

13:23.373 --> 13:26.136
I THINK SHE'S GOOD.
SHE WORKS HARD.

13:26.136 --> 13:27.807
I FEEL BAD EVEN LOOKING.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.881
I'LL FEEL WORSE, THOUGH, LETTING
A STRONGER CANDIDATE PASS US BY.

13:30.881 --> 13:32.983
NOT THE FEEL-GOOD JOB,
IS IT?

13:32.983 --> 13:35.215
CAN'T YOU GIVE ME
A LITTLE INSIGHT?

13:35.215 --> 13:37.547
NO. SEE, THAT'D BE
DOING THE JOB FOR YOU.

13:37.547 --> 13:39.890
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU
THE FISH.

13:39.890 --> 13:42.192
YOU GOT A BIG HOOK
IN THERE.

13:42.192 --> 13:44.925
LEARN TO FISH YOURSELF.

13:47.297 --> 13:49.599
(Miranda)
WHAT KINDA LIFE IS THAT,

13:49.599 --> 13:52.432
LIVING FIVE MONTHS AT A TIME
ON A BOAT,

13:52.432 --> 13:54.534
WORKING 20 HOURS

13:54.534 --> 13:57.567
IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS?

13:57.567 --> 14:00.040
IN 2007, THE C.D.C.
MARKED CRAB FISHING

14:00.040 --> 14:02.512
THE MOST DANGEROUS JOB
IN THE U.S.,

14:02.512 --> 14:04.214
WITH AN ANNUAL FATALITY RATE

14:04.214 --> 14:07.177
28 TIMES HIGHER
THAN ANY OTHER JOB. WHAT?

14:07.177 --> 14:10.120
DUDE, IT'S LIKE WORKING
WITH FORREST GUMP.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.953
THE KID'S 15.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.185
HE SHOULD BE DOING ALGEBRA,

14:15.185 --> 14:17.027
GOING TO SCHOOL DANCES.

14:17.027 --> 14:18.959
HOW MUCH YOU BET
HE DID IT?

14:18.959 --> 14:20.030
WHAT?

14:20.030 --> 14:22.032
HOOKED HIS OLD MAN
ON PURPOSE.

14:22.032 --> 14:24.234
I'D SAY 70%,
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

14:24.234 --> 14:28.198
30% ATTEMPTED MURDER.

14:28.198 --> 14:29.499
WHAT? KAREV'S RIGHT.

14:29.499 --> 14:32.142
TOO MUCH NATURE
MAKES PEOPLE CRAZY.

14:32.142 --> 14:35.505
AH, OKAY.
THERE... IS THE TEAR.

14:35.505 --> 14:39.149
GREY, YOU WANT
TO EMBOLIZE IT?

14:39.149 --> 14:41.481
REALLY? I'VE NEVER
DONE IT BEFORE,

14:41.481 --> 14:43.483
BUT I-I READ
THAT IF YOU USE--

14:43.483 --> 14:46.156
YOU WANT THIS KID
TO BLEED TO DEATH OR WHAT?

14:46.156 --> 14:47.157
(sighs)

14:47.157 --> 14:50.120
DON'T ANALYZE EVERYTHING.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.963
JUST... DO IT.

14:52.963 --> 14:55.065
(sighs)

14:55.065 --> 14:57.227
TELL ME THAT YOU CALLED
THE PARENTS.
SLOAN'S HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS.

14:57.227 --> 14:59.329
SLOAN PICKED THOSE PARENTS.
SHE ASKED YOU TO CALL THEM.

14:59.329 --> 15:03.233
SHE WAS PRETTY CLEAR.
WELL, NOW SHE'S NOT CLEAR.
BY LAW, SHE'S GOT 48 HOURS

15:03.233 --> 15:05.675
BEFORE THE COURT TERMINATES
HER PARENTAL RIGHT.
(Callie)
SLOAN CHANGED HER MIND?

15:05.675 --> 15:07.177
MAYBE.
THAT'S GREAT.

15:07.177 --> 15:09.179
NO, IT'S NOT.
WHAT, SHE CAN'T
CHANGE HER MIND?

15:09.179 --> 15:12.512
PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MINDS.
THIS BABY NEEDS PARENTS,
NOT AN 18-YEAR-OLD CHILD

15:12.512 --> 15:14.914
AND A FATHER WHO SHE MET
FIVE MINUTES AGO.
SHUT UP!

15:14.914 --> 15:16.216
MARK--
NO.

15:16.216 --> 15:19.549
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T GET
TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO HERE.

15:19.549 --> 15:21.591
I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP,

15:21.591 --> 15:23.523
BUT YOU DON'T...

15:25.255 --> 15:27.327
MY MOM IS DEAD.

15:27.327 --> 15:30.200
MY DAD'S NEVER GONNA GET OFF
THE COUCH AGAIN.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.963
I DON'T HAVE ANY BROTHERS
OR SISTERS.

15:32.963 --> 15:35.565
THIS IS MY GRANDSON--

15:35.565 --> 15:37.237
MY GRANDSON.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.469
I'M NOT JUST GONNA
TURN HIM OVER TO SOME STRANGERS

15:39.469 --> 15:41.611
WHEN I MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE
AT A FAMILY.

15:41.611 --> 15:45.675
SO JUST...
GIVE ME A MINUTE HERE.

15:57.587 --> 16:01.131
HOW'S HE DOING?
HIS TEMP'S HIGH.
I-I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY.

16:01.131 --> 16:03.133
IS HIS DAD IN SURGERY YET?

16:03.133 --> 16:05.135
YEAH,
THEY'RE PREPPING HIM NOW.

16:05.135 --> 16:07.167
DOUG, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE YOUR DAD

16:07.167 --> 16:08.668
BEFORE HE GOES INTO SURGERY?

16:08.668 --> 16:10.170
HE'S PROBABLY CALMED DOWN.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.671
HE HATES ME.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.474
HE'S ALWAYS HATED ME.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.207
AND NOW
I PRACTICALLY KILLED HIM.

16:17.207 --> 16:20.250
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE ME.

16:22.112 --> 16:25.215
ONCE WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

16:25.215 --> 16:27.217
I WAS REALLY MAD AT MY MOM,

16:27.217 --> 16:30.690
AND... I HAD HEARD THAT
SACCHARINE CAN KILL YOU,

16:30.690 --> 16:33.463
AND SO... I SWEAR TO GOD,
I ALMOST PUT, LIKE,

16:33.463 --> 16:36.266
TEN PACKETS OF SWEET'N LOW INTO
HER COFFEE ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

16:36.266 --> 16:38.198
I W--I WAS THIS CLOSE.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.430
AND WHILE SHE WAS THINKING
OF SWEETENING HER MOM'S COFFEE,

16:40.430 --> 16:43.303
I TRIED TO RUN MY OLD MAN OVER
WITH A CAR. IT'S NORMAL.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.306
NO, THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT NORMAL.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.537
(coughs)

16:47.537 --> 16:51.041
THOSE HOOKS
WERE MEANT TO CATCH SHARKS.

16:51.041 --> 16:53.513
HE'S NEVER LETTING ME NEAR
HIM OR THE BOAT AGAIN.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.015
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO GO.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.449
OW. OW, MY HEAD
IS, LIKE, POUNDING.

16:59.449 --> 17:01.421
(sighs)

17:01.421 --> 17:04.294
HEY, WE SHOULD GET BLOOD
CULTURES AND A REPEAT C.B.C.

17:04.294 --> 17:06.296
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHY HE'S BURNING UP.

17:06.296 --> 17:07.597
YOU DO THAT, SWEET'N LOW.

17:07.597 --> 17:09.599
I'M GONNA GO WATCH THEM
PULL OUT A HOOK.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.301
(scoffs)

17:11.301 --> 17:12.402
(sighs)

17:12.402 --> 17:15.365
(exhales deeply)

17:15.365 --> 17:17.207
THE BABY SMILED AT MARK.

17:17.207 --> 17:20.410
HE LOOKED UP AND SMILED AT HIM
LIKE HE KNEW HIM.

17:20.410 --> 17:23.743
(scoffs)
THAT POOR BABY'S PARENTS,

17:23.743 --> 17:26.376
JUST SITTING--
STOP CALLING THEM
THE BABY'S--

17:26.376 --> 17:28.218
THAT BABY'S PARENTS...

17:28.218 --> 17:32.252
THE MATURE, CAPABLE,
FINANCIALLY SECURE,

17:32.252 --> 17:35.185
EMOTIONALLY STABLE,
LOVING PARENTS,

17:35.185 --> 17:38.288
WHO WERE DEEMED FIT BY SLOAN
AND THE STATE OF WASHINGTON,

17:38.288 --> 17:41.131
ARE SITTING THERE
BY THE TELEPHONE

17:41.131 --> 17:43.163
STARING AT THE SKY BLUE
NURSERY WALLS

17:43.163 --> 17:45.165
THAT THEY JUST PAINTED.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.097
THOSE ARE THE PARENTS.

17:47.097 --> 17:49.739
NOT MR. MIDLIFE CRISIS
AND HIS TEENAGE KID

17:49.739 --> 17:52.442
WHO--WHO BOUGHT HER INFANT SON
A BAG OF LOLLIPOPS

17:52.442 --> 17:55.545
AND JUICY COUTURE ONESIES.
SO SHE HAS A LOT TO LEARN.

17:55.545 --> 17:58.478
NO, SHE DOESN'T.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.550
SHE MADE
THE ONE SOUND PARENTING DECISION

18:00.550 --> 18:02.782
SHE NEEDS TO MAKE.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.255
SHE FOUND A LOVELY COUPLE
TO RAISE HER BABY.

18:05.255 --> 18:07.257
AND SHE DID THAT MONTHS AGO,

18:07.257 --> 18:09.359
WHEN SHE WASN'T FLOODED
WITH POSTPARTUM HORMONES

18:09.359 --> 18:13.623
OR--OR OVERWHELMED BY
HEARTFELT PLEAS FROM HER DAD,

18:13.623 --> 18:18.268
WHEN SHE HAD TIME
TO THINK CLEARLY...

18:18.268 --> 18:20.270
ABOUT WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR HER

18:20.270 --> 18:22.272
AND--AND WHAT WAS RIGHT
FOR THE BABY.

18:22.272 --> 18:25.235
SHE MADE A DECISION,
A GOOD DECISION.
(sighs deeply)

18:25.235 --> 18:27.237
AND IT WOULD--
IT WOULD BE GREAT

18:27.237 --> 18:30.240
IF WE COULD ALL JUST TRY
AND RESPECT THAT.
(whispers) OKAY.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.382

28:07.787 --> 28:12.221
I KNOW. NOW WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

28:16.395 --> 28:17.897
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:17.897 --> 28:20.399
(Owen) KAREV, WHAT'S THE STATUS
ON YOUR PATIENT?

28:20.399 --> 28:22.401
TEMPERATURE SPIKED,
BUT THE DUDE'S DOING FINE.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.974
WE'RE RUNNING NEW LABS.
DR. ALTMAN, STOP.

28:24.974 --> 28:27.236
DR. GREY, YOU ALWAYS SHOUT
AT PEOPLE

28:27.236 --> 28:30.239
RIGHT BEFORE
THEY START OPERATING?
DOUG HAS
KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIA.

28:30.239 --> 28:32.341
AND I'M GUESSING
WALTER HERE DOES, TOO.

28:32.341 --> 28:34.343
WE NEED TO START
TO IMIPENEM, STAT,

28:34.343 --> 28:36.145
OR THINGS COULD GET UGLY FAST.
KLEBSIELLA?

28:36.145 --> 28:38.287
IT'S HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS
IN CLOSE QUARTERS,

28:38.287 --> 28:40.289
LIKE LIVING ON A CRAB BOAT
FOR MONTHS AT A TIME.

28:40.289 --> 28:42.952
AND I THINK THAT HEMOTHORAX
IS A MIXTURE OF BLOOD

28:42.952 --> 28:45.124
AND AN EMPYEMA.
THANKS FOR THE HEADS-UP.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.356
(Lexie) YEAH, WELL,
YOU WERE BUSY.
MAYBE WE SHOULD OPEN HIM
TO CHECK ANYWAY.

28:47.356 --> 28:49.859
NO, I, UM...

28:49.859 --> 28:52.301
I-I THINK I WAS WRONG HERE.

28:52.301 --> 28:56.135
Get him out of the O.R.,
into the I.C.U. now.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.840
(Mark) OH.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.341
THIS DAY HAS TO END.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.843
OH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.345
(groans)
I WAS SUPPOSED TO WATCH
TOM EVANS WORK.

29:06.345 --> 29:09.418
(blows air)
MEANWHILE, I GOT STUCK
IN AN O.R. ALL DAY

29:09.418 --> 29:11.881
WATCHING TEDDY ALTMAN DECOMPOSE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES.

29:11.881 --> 29:14.283
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT'S TOM EVANS DOING HERE?

29:14.283 --> 29:16.485
TAKING A LOOK AROUND.

29:16.485 --> 29:18.487
WHY? YOU DON'T NEED EVANS.
YOU GOT TEDDY.

29:18.487 --> 29:21.260
I DON'T NEED TEDDY
IF I'VE GOT EVANS.

29:21.260 --> 29:25.394
WHAT? NO, YOU--YOU CAN'T.
ME AND--ME AND TEDDY, W--

29:25.394 --> 29:29.068
(sighs) OH, GOD.
SEE, THIS IS MY POINT EXACTLY.

29:29.068 --> 29:31.370
I CAN'T STAFF THIS HOSPITAL
BASED ON THE FACT

29:31.370 --> 29:34.503
THAT SHE'S HUNT'S FRIEND
AND YOUR FLAVOR OF THE MONTH.

29:34.503 --> 29:37.947
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST
SICK OF WORRYING ABOUT THIS.

29:37.947 --> 29:40.449
THIS JOB IS EXHAUSTING.
I'M SORRY. THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT?

29:40.449 --> 29:42.151
SCREW YOU.

29:42.151 --> 29:44.053
I'M LOSING EVERYTHING TODAY.

29:44.053 --> 29:45.885
EVERYTHING!

29:45.885 --> 29:47.817

29:47.817 --> 29:49.919

29:49.919 --> 29:53.122

GO AHEAD.

29:55.024 --> 29:57.496
(pants)

29:57.496 --> 30:00.569
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CALL
A COUPLE OF STRANGERS

30:00.569 --> 30:03.532
AND TELL 'EM
TO COME TAKE MY KID?

30:03.532 --> 30:06.335
SLOAN'S YOUR KID, MARK.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.438
YOU'RE NOT LOSING HER.

30:09.438 --> 30:12.341
THEY'RE NOT TAKING HER.

30:16.815 --> 30:20.389
HEY! DID YOU SEE ME
IN THE O.R.?

30:20.389 --> 30:22.091
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

30:22.091 --> 30:25.224
WHAT?
YOU REALLY THINK THAT EVANS
IS GONNA TAKE YOU UNDER

30:25.224 --> 30:27.096
HIS AWARD-WINNING WING?
HE WON'T.

30:27.096 --> 30:29.828
HE DOESN'T NEED YOU.
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT STUDENTS.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.830
HE'S A ROCK STAR,
NOT A TEACHER.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.333
HE IS A ROCK STAR. TEDDY,
HE'S TOTALLY A ROCK STAR.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.605
I MEAN, DID YOU SEE HIM
IN THERE?

30:36.605 --> 30:38.607
HE WAS LIKE AN OCTOPUS
DOING A MILLION THINGS,

30:38.607 --> 30:41.440
LIKE CUTTING, RETRACTING,
SUCTIONING ALL AT ONCE.
YOU THINK THAT I NEED YOU

30:41.440 --> 30:43.442
TO HOLD MY INSTRUMENTS
WHEN I OPERATE?

30:43.442 --> 30:45.915
YOU THINK THAT HELPS ME
SAVE THE PATIENT?

30:45.915 --> 30:47.917
I DO IT SO THAT
YOU CAN LEARN, CRISTINA.

30:47.917 --> 30:50.980
I'D BE A LOT FASTER
IN THE O.R. WITHOUT YOU.

30:50.980 --> 30:53.252
DID YOU NOTICE YOU NEVER EVEN
TOUCHED THAT PATIENT?

30:53.252 --> 30:55.424
YOUR GLOVES WERE TOTALLY CLEAN
AT THE END OF SURGERY.

30:55.424 --> 30:57.456
DID YOU LEARN A LOT?
TEDDY, IT WAS ONE SURGERY.

30:57.456 --> 31:00.589
(sighs) HE'S HERE
FOR MY JOB, CRISTINA.

31:00.589 --> 31:02.591
DO YOU REALLY NOT GET THAT?

31:02.591 --> 31:05.294
