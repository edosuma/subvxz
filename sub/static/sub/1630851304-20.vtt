COOKOUT ALLIANCE WAS SECRETARY

00:09.517 --> 00:13.172
I'M NOT JUST TRYING TO GET
THE SIX OF US TO JURY.

00:13.206 --> 00:18.137
I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO SEE TWO
MEMBERS OF THE COOKOUT IN THE

00:18.172 --> 00:22.000
FINAL TWO SEATSZ AND THEY ALL
HAD UNSUSPECTING PARTNERS

00:22.034 --> 00:23.241

00:23.275 --> 00:28.862
KYLAND HAD SARAH BETH, HANNAH
HAD DEREK X, X DISPLAIFIER HAD

00:28.896 --> 00:33.034
ALYSSA, TIFFANY HAD CLAIRE AND
AZAH AND BIG D HAD BRITINI.

00:33.068 --> 00:36.413
I NOW HAVE TO NAME A
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

00:36.448 --> 00:40.413
AND UNFORTUNATELY, BRITINI, THAT
IS YOU.

00:40.448 --> 00:44.034
WITH BRITINI FAKE SEEMINGLY
DEAL.

00:44.068 --> 00:46.344
HOW THE WORLD AM I UP AGAIN.

00:46.379 --> 00:50.724
Announcer: THE COOKOUT
STARTED LOOKING FOR THEIR NEXT

00:50.758 --> 00:54.413
TARGET.

00:54.448 --> 00:57.103
CLAIRE.

00:57.137 --> 00:59.724
AND DEREK X'S DAYS SEEMED
NUMBER.

00:59.758 --> 01:02.758
RIGHT NOW DEREK X IS THE
BIGGEST KNOWN THREAT IN THE

01:02.793 --> 01:05.586
HOUSE NOT ONLY TO MY PERSONAL
GAME BUT ALSO TO THE COOKOUT AS

01:05.620 --> 01:06.724
A WHOLE.

01:06.758 --> 01:09.689
Announcer: AFTER THE
HOUSEGUESTS CALLED IT A RAP ON

01:09.724 --> 01:10.896
THE RAPPER.

01:10.931 --> 01:16.896
Julie: BY A VOTE OF 7-1,
BRITINI, YOU ARE EVICTED FROM

01:16.931 --> 01:19.206
THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

01:19.241 --> 01:26.034
Announcer: THE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD WAS BACK ON THE LINE.

01:26.068 --> 01:27.137
NICE.

01:27.172 --> 01:30.413
Announcer: AND DEREK X
CAME WITHIN ONE SECOND OF

01:30.448 --> 01:31.827
ACHIEVING GLORY.

01:31.862 --> 01:33.000
OH MY GOSH.

01:33.034 --> 01:36.413
Announcer: BUT HE WASN'T
FAST ENOUGH TO STOP SB FROM

01:36.448 --> 01:37.620
ASCENDING TO POWER.

01:37.655 --> 01:40.034
Julie: CONGRATULATIONS
SARAH BETH, YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD

01:40.068 --> 01:42.413
OF HOUSE HOLD.

01:42.448 --> 01:46.517
Announcer: TONIGHT WHO
WILL SARAH BETH NOMINATE FOR

01:46.551 --> 01:47.413
EVICTION.

01:47.448 --> 01:49.655
PLUS THE HIGH ROLLERS ROOM IS
BACK OPEN.

01:49.689 --> 01:53.172
HOW MANY BB BUCKS DID AMERICA
GIVE TO EACH HOUSEGUEST?

01:53.206 --> 01:58.655
AND WILL THE CHOPPING BLOCK
ROULETTE POWER SAVE ONE OF THE

01:58.689 --> 01:59.482
NOMINEES.

01:59.517 --> 02:04.068
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER".

02:04.103 --> 02:20.344
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO PEOPLE?

02:20.379 --> 02:26.413
SB'S TIME I THINK WAS STILL
FASTER.

02:26.448 --> 02:30.310
I DON'T WANT TO RUB IT IN
PEOPLE'S FACES SO.

02:30.344 --> 02:31.620
HI, EVERYONE.

02:31.655 --> 02:36.137
MY NAME IS SAR SARAH BETH, I'M
THE FIRST FEMALE H.O.H. IN THIS

02:36.172 --> 02:36.586
HOUSE.

02:36.620 --> 02:37.724
I'M SO EXCITED.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.862
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO
COMEETLY CHANGE HOW MY GAME IS

02:40.896 --> 02:41.655
GOING.

02:41.689 --> 02:48.413
I WANT THAT 750,000 SO FRIKING
BAD.

02:48.448 --> 02:49.689
OH, YAY.

02:49.724 --> 02:51.931
IT FEELS GREAT TO STILL BE IN
THIS HOUSE.

02:51.965 --> 02:55.758
THE FACT THAT I AM STILL HERE
AND IN THE RUNNING AND THE FACT

02:55.793 --> 03:07.000
THAT I GOT TO KISS-- GOT A
KISS FROM KYLAND, I'M HAPPY.

03:07.034 --> 03:11.137
BUT THEN MY PARADE ENDED.

03:11.172 --> 03:14.000
ONCE THAT DAMN SARAH BETH WON
H.O.H.

03:14.034 --> 03:18.448
SOMEONE IN THE COOKOUT DIDN'T
WIN AND NOW WE'RE ALL GOING TO

03:18.482 --> 03:19.724
BE SCRAMBLING.

03:19.758 --> 03:24.103
I DO HAVE KYLAND ON THE INSIDES
WORKING ON SARAH BETH BUT IT'S

03:24.137 --> 03:27.862
TIME FOR SOMEONE ELSE IN THIS
HOUSE TO BE A PAWN.

03:27.896 --> 03:31.620
DID YOU JUST RUN OR DID YOU
TAKE LONG STRIDES OR.

03:31.655 --> 03:34.758
SB IS THE LAST PERSON THAT I
WANTED TO WIN.

03:34.793 --> 03:38.241
PRETTY SURE THAT SHE STILL
DISTRUSTS ME AS MUCH AS I

03:38.275 --> 03:39.034
DISTRUST HER.

03:39.068 --> 03:41.448
SO SB WAS MY TARGET FOR THE
WEEK.

03:41.482 --> 03:46.034
THIS REALLY SETS THE COOKOUT'S
GAME FURTHER BACK AND I'M

03:46.068 --> 03:47.689
ANNOYED ABOUT IT.

03:47.724 --> 03:48.413
WELL DESERVED.

03:48.448 --> 03:59.379
YOU KILLED IT.

03:59.413 --> 04:02.551
AS THE CLOSEST ALLY TO THE
NEW H.O.H. THIS WEEK, I STILL

04:02.586 --> 04:13.379
HAVE MY TOP PRIORITY OF KEEPING
MEMBERS OF THE COOKOUT SAFE THIS

04:13.413 --> 04:14.482
WEEK.

04:14.517 --> 04:17.413
HOWEVER I CAN'T REVEAL THAT
PRIORITY TO SARAH BETH.

04:17.448 --> 04:22.896
IF I HEAR HER MENTION THE NAME
OF ONE OF THE SIX AS A POTENTIAL

04:22.931 --> 04:30.482
TARGET, I KNOW I HAVE TO PUT A
STOP TO IT BEFORE IT GOES ANY

04:30.517 --> 04:31.137
FURTHER.

04:31.172 --> 04:45.586
WHAT THE HECK DO I DO?

04:45.620 --> 04:51.172
BUT LIKE IT IS YOUR H.O.H.

04:51.206 --> 04:52.862
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

04:52.896 --> 05:03.413
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

05:03.448 --> 05:07.344
I HATED SEEING HER PICTURE
TURN BLACK AND WHITE, IF I

05:07.379 --> 05:10.758
WASN'T PART OF THE COOKOUT, THAT
WOULD BE THE PERSON I WOULD

05:10.793 --> 05:23.413
DEFINITELY BE SENDING TO FINAL
TWO WITH ME.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.862
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO.

05:24.896 --> 05:29.206
THIS WAS WHAT I DIDN'T WANT
TO HAPPEN.

05:29.241 --> 05:30.241
LAST WEEK.

05:30.275 --> 05:38.724
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE
COULD HAVE AVOIDED.

05:38.758 --> 05:50.586
NO IDEA WHERE SHE WOULD-- OF
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE

05:50.620 --> 05:56.724
WON H.O.H. SARAH BOTH WAS MY
LAST, MY LAST, THE LEAST PERSON

05:56.758 --> 06:02.586
IN ALL MY LIFE THAT I WANTED TO
WIN H.O.H. THIS WEEK.

06:02.620 --> 06:08.724
I WANTED TO BE H.O.H. BEFORE
SARAH BETH AND PUT SARAH BETH ON

06:08.758 --> 06:09.517
THE BLOCK.

06:09.551 --> 06:13.827
NOW I'M PROBLY GOING ON THE
BLOCK.

06:13.862 --> 06:16.931
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING
TO GET OUT OF THIS.

06:16.965 --> 06:19.275
OH MY GOSH, WE NEED TO GET
OUT.

06:19.310 --> 06:31.724
I DON'T BELIEVE SHE-- I DON'T
BELIEVE-- .

06:31.758 --> 06:34.931
>>-- AREN'T MY STRONG SUIT, IN
CASE YOU WERE WONDERING.

06:34.965 --> 06:38.655
I'M SO TIRED OF LOSING.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.172
YOU ALMOST WON THAT.

06:40.206 --> 06:43.620
THAT SHOULD BE HER MAIN
TARGET.

06:43.655 --> 06:50.413
BECAUSE-- PUT HER ON THE BLOCK.

06:50.448 --> 06:52.000
>>.

06:52.034 --> 06:53.206
I JUST CAN'T BE ANOTHER PAWN.

06:53.241 --> 06:54.482
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

06:54.517 --> 06:58.620
I KNOW THAT, KY, BUT I DON'T
WANT TO BE A PAWN AGAIN.

06:58.655 --> 07:00.551
I UNDERSTAND.

07:00.586 --> 07:11.758
THERE IS NO CHANCE OF TWO-- ON
VETOES ON THURSDAY.

07:11.793 --> 07:13.827
MY MENTAL STATE IS LOSING IT.

07:13.862 --> 07:16.379
I'M DPING TO BLOW A GAS KET.

07:16.413 --> 07:18.517
THE WEEK TO BLOW A GAS KET IS
NOT WHEN.

07:18.551 --> 07:20.482
I KNOW, I KNOW.

07:20.517 --> 07:22.551
I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT WITH
SARAH BETH.

07:22.586 --> 07:24.862
I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS

07:24.896 --> 07:26.724
ESTABLISHED BACK WHEN WE
APPROXIMATE MEMBERS OF THE

07:26.758 --> 07:28.000
FORMER KINGS TEAM.

07:28.034 --> 07:30.517
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I FEEL SAFE
BUT BECAUSE I HAVE THE COOKOUT

07:30.551 --> 07:43.206
TO THINK ABOUT, I AM FEELING
LESS THAN GREAT.

07:43.241 --> 07:50.517
EVERYTHING FRK THEY JUST WENT
DIFFERENTLY.

07:50.551 --> 07:53.379
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

07:53.413 --> 08:03.793
I MEAN I DID PUT UP SB SO-- I
DON'T FEEL THAT BAD WITH HER.

08:03.827 --> 08:06.551
BUT YOU DID PUT SB-- FOR HER.

08:06.586 --> 08:07.758
YEAH.

08:07.793 --> 08:12.172
I'M SURE WHEREVER HER HEADS
AT IS WHERE KY'S HEAD IS AT.

08:12.206 --> 08:14.103
I WANTED THE POWER THIS WEEK.

08:14.137 --> 08:17.965
I FEEL VERY LUKEWARM ABOUT SARAH
BETH BEING THE NEW H.O.H.,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
ESPECIALLY AFTER I PUT HER UP
DURING MAY HO, HAD.

08:20.034 --> 08:24.241
I JUST HOPE MY RELATIONSHIP WITH
KYLAND IS ENOUGH TO KEEP ME SAFE

08:24.275 --> 08:25.448
THIS WEEK.

08:25.482 --> 08:30.758
AT LEAST IF YOU DO GO ON, YOU
HAVE A CHANCE TO COMPETE.

08:30.793 --> 08:31.655
RIGHT.

08:31.689 --> 08:34.862
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WOULD
TARGET.

08:34.896 --> 08:35.241
ME EITHER.

08:35.275 --> 08:36.137
YEAH.

08:36.172 --> 08:42.517
I DON'T KNOW HOW I SHOULD
FEEL EITHER.

08:42.551 --> 08:51.034
SHE KNOWS HOW BADLY I-- THE
WHOLE THING IS YOU COULD FEEL

08:51.068 --> 08:54.517
SAFER-- THERE IS NO POINT TO
FEEL SAFE OR NOT SAFE.

08:54.551 --> 08:57.206
IN THE HIGH ROLLERS ROOM
THERE ARE THREE POWERS TO PLAY

08:57.241 --> 08:58.310
TO WIN.

08:58.344 --> 09:00.965
THIS WEEK THE ONLY ONE THAT
PEOPLE CAN AFFORD IS THE

09:01.000 --> 09:02.413
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE.

09:02.448 --> 09:04.965
WHOEVER THE WINNER OF THE
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE IS, THEY

09:05.000 --> 09:08.620
GET TO REMOVE A NOMINEE OF THE
BLOCK AND THEY ARE ALSO SAFE AS

09:08.655 --> 09:09.931
WELL.

09:09.965 --> 09:12.241
AND THEN THE WINNER GETS TO SPIN
THE WHEEL TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE

09:12.275 --> 09:13.620
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE WILL BE.

09:13.655 --> 09:18.551
YOU COULD SPIN A WHEEL AND THE
NUMBER ONE ALLY COULD BE PUT ON

09:18.586 --> 09:19.620
THE BLOCK.

09:19.655 --> 09:22.448
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

09:22.482 --> 09:30.551
BNS THAT WHEEL-- I CAN'T IMAGINE
TAT FEELING.

09:30.586 --> 09:32.827
WITHIN HI.

09:32.862 --> 09:34.241
WHAT UP, DEREK.

09:34.275 --> 09:40.896
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
TALK TO SB FOR A FEW MINUTES.

09:40.931 --> 09:41.724
YES, YES.

09:41.758 --> 09:48.517
I TALKED TO EVERYBODY ELSE
TODAY.

09:48.551 --> 09:52.896
WE I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WE
NEEDED TO-- IF I KNEW THAT I

09:52.931 --> 09:57.827
WOULD HAVE-- TWNS WE HAD BUTTED
HEADS IN THE PAST AND WE HADN'T

09:57.862 --> 10:00.551
BEEN GETTING ALONGMENT I WANT TO
MAKE SURE THAT ME AND TIFFANY

10:00.586 --> 10:01.344
ARE GOOD.

10:01.379 --> 10:03.448
HAVE I TO LOOK OUT FOR THE
COOKOUT.

10:03.482 --> 10:05.344
I THOUGHT WE WAS ON THE SAME
PAGE.

10:05.379 --> 10:06.655
YEAH.

10:06.689 --> 10:10.310
WHEN YOU ROLLED UP HERE LIKE
DIVA WITH BRITINI TO CHECK ME AT

10:10.344 --> 10:13.965
THE H.O.H. LAST WEEK I WAS LIKE
WE OBVIOUSLY ON TWO DIFFERENT

10:14.000 --> 10:14.793
PAGES.

10:14.827 --> 10:19.000
MAYBE WE READING TWO DIFFERENT
BOOKS.

10:19.034 --> 10:20.862
YOU RANG?

10:20.896 --> 10:24.586
NO, I JUST WANTED TO TALK
TO.

10:24.620 --> 10:25.586
WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE WE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALK FREELY,

10:25.620 --> 10:26.068
RIGHT.

10:26.103 --> 10:32.103
IT'S ALL GOOD.

10:32.137 --> 10:33.413
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

10:33.448 --> 10:40.241
I'M JUST MEETING WITH.

10:40.275 --> 10:50.586
WE-- OH, GREAT, SO MY THING
WAS I LOOKED AT IT BECAUSE ME

10:50.620 --> 10:52.206
AND YOU WERE CUT FROM THE SAME
CLOTH.

10:52.241 --> 10:53.689
WE NOT CUT FROM THE SAME
CLOTH.

10:53.724 --> 10:57.724
MY CLOTH I'M CUT FROM, I HANDLE
AT THE TIME.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.000
RIGHT.

10:59.034 --> 11:02.137
I WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY COME
AND SAID THE WAY I CAME AT YOU

11:02.172 --> 11:05.137
IS NOT APPROPRIATE.

11:05.172 --> 11:07.241
YOU STILL AIN'T SAID THAT PU GO
AHEAD.

11:07.275 --> 11:11.206
IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO CLAIRE
AND ME AND HANNAH ROLL UP ON YOU

11:11.241 --> 11:13.827
LIKE WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO
CLAIRE FOR, WHAT'S UP.

11:13.862 --> 11:16.275
HOLD ON, THERE WAS NO ROLLING
UP.

11:16.310 --> 11:19.689
I WAS THERE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T
FEEL COMFORTABLE, LIKE SHE SAID.

11:19.724 --> 11:21.655
BUT YOU STAND BY THAT, OKAY.

11:21.689 --> 11:24.758
I'M STANDING BY THAT BECAUSE
SOMEONE.

11:24.793 --> 11:25.724
NO PROBLEM.

11:25.758 --> 11:28.724
I FELT LIKE IT WAS
CONFRONTATIONAL TRK WAS AN

11:28.758 --> 11:30.034
AMBUSH.

11:30.068 --> 11:31.655
OKAY, BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE HOW
YOU WERE TALKING, THE TONE THAT

11:31.689 --> 11:36.827
YOU WERE GIVING WAS STILL LIKE
DEMANDING AND VERY.

11:36.862 --> 11:42.206
OH, SO ROLLING UP ON ME TO
INTIMIDATE ME IS BETTER THAN

11:42.241 --> 11:43.413
SAYING LET ME.

11:43.448 --> 11:47.379
HOLD UP, IF I ROLLEDDED UP ON
YOU, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE

11:47.413 --> 11:49.206
CALLED YOU.

11:49.241 --> 11:49.689
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

11:49.724 --> 11:50.931
OKAY.

11:50.965 --> 11:52.862
THE FACT THAT YOU STANDING
HERE IN FRONT OF ME DEFENDING

11:52.896 --> 11:55.724
THAT, LETS ME KNOW IT WASN'T
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.689
WE DON'T GET NOWHERE.

11:57.724 --> 11:58.896
WE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE.

11:58.931 --> 12:02.655
WE NOT CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH,
WE AIN'T FROM THE SAME FOG

12:02.689 --> 12:06.172
BECAUSE YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE A
APOLOGIZE, NEVER BROUGHT IT UP,

12:06.206 --> 12:11.827
MAKE IT EXCUSES, DEFENDING IT,
SO WE ARE DIFFERENT.

12:11.862 --> 12:12.827
I UNDERSTAND ARE YOU ANGRY.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.931
I'M FUMING RIGHT NOW.

12:14.965 --> 12:16.206
OKAY.

12:16.241 --> 12:19.379
THE COOKOUT WITH DEREK F IS
ALL GOOD HOWEVER THAT CHAPTER OF

12:19.413 --> 12:21.000
MY BOOK WILL BE CLOSED.

12:21.034 --> 12:25.758
I DON'T OWE DEREK X ANYTHING
EXCEPTLY IF HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY

12:25.793 --> 12:28.965
RESPECT FOR ME IN THIS HOUSE.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.793
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW TO ME
IT WAS VERY DISRESPECTFUL.

12:35.827 --> 12:37.862
SO MI GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR
THAT.

12:37.896 --> 12:40.827
DON'T APOLOGIZE UNLESS YOU
MEAN IT.

12:40.862 --> 12:43.344
ASK THE FOOLING, I DIDN'T DO
NOTHING WRONG BUT I WILL DO

12:43.379 --> 12:46.793
WHATEVER IT IT TAKES JUST TO
MAKE SURE WE'RE GOOD BECAUSE I

12:46.827 --> 12:50.827
REFUSE TO LET TIFFANY AND HER
ANTICS RUIN THAT COOKOUT.

12:50.862 --> 12:51.965
I'M LIVID RIGHT NOW.

13:04.103 --> 13:05.965
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

13:06.000 --> 13:06.965
I'M HAPPY.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.931
YEAH, GOOD WKS.

13:08.965 --> 13:10.206
YOU GOT TO BE HAPPY.

13:10.241 --> 13:13.793
YOU HAVE TO BE STOKED.

13:13.827 --> 13:18.551
I THINK RIGHT NOW IN MY GUT,
AND I WANT TO THINK THINGS

13:18.586 --> 13:19.724
THROUGH STILL.

13:19.758 --> 13:25.827
I'M NOT SURE IF I TRUST DX MORE
OR I TRUST ALYSSA MORE.

13:25.862 --> 13:29.896
I FEEL GOOD WITH CLAIRE AND
TIFFANY.

13:29.931 --> 13:32.206
ONE THING THAT MAKES ME FEEL
GOOD ABOUT THEM IS THAT THEY

13:32.241 --> 13:33.275
ACTUALLY LISTEN TO ME.

13:33.310 --> 13:38.413
YOU KNOW WHO DOESN'T LISTEN TO
ME IS ALYSSA AND X.

13:38.448 --> 13:42.103
I USED TO BE ON THE SAME TEAM
WITH ALYSSA I DID FEEL CLOSE

13:42.137 --> 13:45.448
WITH MY TEAM BUT I ALWAYS GOT
THE SENSE THAT I WAS POSSIBLY

13:45.482 --> 13:49.103
THE BOTTOM OF THE TOTEM POLE
AMONG THEM.

13:49.137 --> 13:53.793
BEING ON THE BLOCK NEXT TO
CHRISTIAN DEFINITELY DID NOT

13:53.827 --> 13:58.275
SECURE MY RELATIONSHIP WITH
ALYSSA AND THE-- AT ALL.

13:58.310 --> 14:07.068
I DON'T KNOW, I KIND OF--
X-ZAVIER IS NOT ONLY A

14:07.103 --> 14:10.344
MEMBER OF THE SIX BUT ONE OF MY
CLOSEST AND STRONGEST ALLIES IN

14:10.379 --> 14:11.586
THE GAME.

14:11.620 --> 14:14.172
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE I DO
WHATEVER I CAN TO ENSURE THAT HE

14:14.206 --> 14:18.689
IS SAFE THIS WEEK.

14:18.724 --> 14:24.034
FOR ME, PRIORITY FOR THURSDAY,
WE WANT THE POWER USED AND MONEY

14:24.068 --> 14:26.620
SPENT, SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
THOSE WOULD BE MINE.

14:26.655 --> 14:27.862
YOU HAVE YOURS.

14:27.896 --> 14:35.034
I WANT TO ASK DO YOU WANT THE
POWER, LIKE IT MY GOAL IS TO

14:35.068 --> 14:38.000
FIGURE OUT WHO CAN I NOMINATE
WHERE I CAN FEEL CONFIDENT POT

14:38.034 --> 14:42.689
WE ARE IS GOING TO BE USED AND
WHOEVER COMES OFF WITH THE POWER

14:42.724 --> 14:45.517
SUSPECT TARGETING-- THAT IS MY
GOAL.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.448
I WANT TO GET SOMEONE OUT
THAT IS A THREAT TO ME.

14:48.482 --> 14:50.517
BUT NEXT WEEK I CAN'T BE H.O.H.

14:50.551 --> 14:53.724
AND I WILL BE EXTREMELY
VULNERABLE.

14:53.758 --> 14:57.172
LEAVING TWO POWERS IN PLAY WHEN
I'M DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE

14:57.206 --> 14:59.275
H.O.H. IS WAY TOO RISKY.

14:59.310 --> 15:03.068
HOPE NEE I CAN USE MY POWER AS
THE H.O.H. TO MAKE SURE THE

15:03.103 --> 15:06.724
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE GETS
USED.

15:06.758 --> 15:12.724
I WILL TRY TO-- .

15:12.758 --> 15:13.689
OKAY.

15:13.724 --> 15:15.241
YES, I FINALLY HAVE POWER.

15:15.275 --> 15:30.000
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER ALL OF MY
QUESTIONS.

15:30.034 --> 15:33.344
YES, I'M SO HAPPY.

15:33.379 --> 15:37.724
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS THE-- HARD
ARE FOR ME TO DECIDE WHAT I WANT

15:37.758 --> 15:41.448
TO DO I DEFINITELY WANT POT WE
ARE TO BE USED.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.034
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT IT TO
BE USED.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.827
I THINK IT WOULD MAKE SENSE,
YEAH.

15:44.862 --> 15:47.034
IF YOU GET 75 OR 100.

15:47.068 --> 15:48.379
THEN I WANT TO PLAYINGS YOU
WOULD PLAY.

15:48.413 --> 15:49.793
THEN YOU WOULD PLAY IT.

15:49.827 --> 15:50.896
IF YOU WANT ME TO, I WILL.

15:50.931 --> 15:52.931
I THINK I WOULD.

15:52.965 --> 15:56.172
OTHER THAN X-ZAVIER, I
LITERALLY HAVE NO ONE I CAN

15:56.206 --> 15:57.310
TRUST.

15:57.344 --> 15:59.758
SO I WANT TO PLAY IN CHOPPING
BOCK ROULETTE THIS WEEK.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.965
I'M HOPING THAT I WIN THIS TO
SECURE PIE OWN SAFETY BUT I WANT

16:03.000 --> 16:06.310
SARAH BETH TO THINK THAT I'M
PLAYING THE PETITION FOR HER

16:06.344 --> 16:09.931
THAT WAY I CAN GAIN SOME TRUST
WITH HER.

16:09.965 --> 16:12.724
I'M TOTALLY WILLING TO PLAY
IT IF YOU WANT ME TO PLAY IT,

16:12.758 --> 16:14.000
100 PERCENT.

16:14.034 --> 16:15.275
WHOEVER I NOMINATE, WHATEVER
THE PLAN IS, I DEFINITELY WANT

16:15.310 --> 16:18.724
IT TO BE SOMETHING WHERE IT GETS
THE POWER USED.

16:18.758 --> 16:21.172
UH-HUH.

16:21.206 --> 16:24.724
I KNOW THAT YOU.

16:24.758 --> 16:28.965
I PLAYED VETO DERBY LAST WEEK
AND I HAVE 0 DOLLARS SO SARAH

16:29.000 --> 16:35.482
BETH, IF YOU WANT THIS TO BE
USED, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL.

16:35.517 --> 16:40.172
YOU GOING TO MAKE ME SPEND MY
MONEY OR MOT?

16:40.206 --> 16:40.689
DAMN IT?

16:40.724 --> 16:41.137
ALL RIGHT.

16:41.172 --> 16:42.448
HIT ME WITH IT.

16:42.482 --> 16:47.000
I HAVE DECIDED THAT I DO WANT
THE POWER TO BE USED THIS WEEK.

16:47.034 --> 16:51.034
I'M WILLING TO PLAY IT.

16:51.068 --> 16:56.758
BUT I WOULD RATHER A-- .

16:56.793 --> 16:59.241
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT THE
POWER.

16:59.275 --> 17:03.000
WOULD YOU RATHER IT BE PLAYED
THIS WEEK OR NOT BE PLAYED THIS

17:03.034 --> 17:04.206
WEEK?

17:04.241 --> 17:06.206
I WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO BE
PLAYED BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

17:06.241 --> 17:11.068
BE IT IT FLOATING AROUND FOR
ANOTHER WEEK.

17:11.103 --> 17:12.275
HUH-UH UH-HUH.

17:12.310 --> 17:14.413
I AIN'T GOT IT BECAUSE I
PLAYED LAST WEEK BUT IF I GET

17:14.448 --> 17:15.724
THE MONEY I WILL TELL YOU.

17:15.758 --> 17:18.448
EVERYONE KNOWS I PLAYED VETO
DERBY LAST WEEK SO IT LOOKS LIKE

17:18.482 --> 17:21.413
I HAVE 0 DOLLARS IN MY ACCOUNT
BUT I DON'T.

17:21.448 --> 17:26.034
I HAVE $50 LEFT AND I'M NOT
TELLING ANYONE ESPECIALLY SARAH

17:26.068 --> 17:26.931
BETH.

17:26.965 --> 17:28.724
SHE'S NOT GETTING THAT OUT OF
ME, BABY.

17:28.758 --> 17:30.000
I WOULD NEVER TELL YOU THAT.

17:42.068 --> 17:45.241
YOU THINK YOU CAN PLAY THIS
ENTIRE GAME AND NOT HAVE A

17:45.275 --> 17:47.724
SINGLE ALLIANCE.

17:47.758 --> 17:51.448
I DON'T KNOW, SHE IS SEEMS
LIKE THE TYPE THAT WOULDN'T.

17:51.482 --> 17:55.655
EVERY NOW AND THEN I HAVE TO
ASK MYSELF WHO IS EVERYONE

17:55.689 --> 17:56.620
POSSIBLY WORKING WITH.

17:56.655 --> 18:02.241
WHO ARE YOU THINKING?

18:02.275 --> 18:03.724
X?

18:03.758 --> 18:08.172
THAT WOULDN'T BE AN ALLIANCE,
THAT WOULD BE A PERSONAL

18:08.206 --> 18:08.758
RELATIONSHIP.

18:08.793 --> 18:17.896
WHAT IF IT ST.
.

18:17.931 --> 18:36.827
BECAUSE I THINK ALL THE GUYS
WANT TO RIDE WITH THE GUYS.

18:36.862 --> 18:38.206
HEY.

18:38.241 --> 18:43.344
WHERE IS SHE AT?

18:43.379 --> 18:52.413
I KNOW, SHE WAS LIKE-- ALL
RIGHT.

18:52.448 --> 18:55.793
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT BE PARANOID
IN THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE,

18:55.827 --> 18:59.620
THERE IS NO WAY WE MADE IT ALL
OF THESE WEEKS AND NO ONE IN

18:59.655 --> 19:01.172
THIS HOUSE HAS AN ALLIANCE.

19:01.206 --> 19:05.137
WHEN X COMES UP IN CONVERSATION
WITH TIFFANY SHE ALWAYS TRIES TO

19:05.172 --> 19:08.793
DEFLECT THE CONVERSATION TOWARD
SOME ONE ELSE.

19:08.827 --> 19:17.103
BIGGEST SURPRISE ALLIANCE, X?

19:17.137 --> 19:18.310
TIFFANY?

19:18.344 --> 19:25.724
IF ALL THOSE PEOPLE ARE
WORKING TOGETHER THEN THERE IS A

19:25.758 --> 19:38.206
WHOLE SIDE OF THE HOUSE THAT I
AM JUST NOT AWARE OF.

19:38.241 --> 19:45.034
OH GOD, MI GOING TO GO HOME.

19:45.068 --> 19:45.862
SHE'S NOT.

19:45.896 --> 19:48.137
I DON'T KNOW, I'M JUST
WONDERING.

19:48.172 --> 19:51.344
SHE IS GOING TO REIGN TERROR
ON THIS HOUSE.

19:51.379 --> 20:03.206
AND THAT IS WHY I AM JUST KIND
OF LIKE-- SOMEONE LIKE HER.

20:03.241 --> 20:06.827
SARAH BETH IS THE ONE PERSON
OUTSIDE THE COOKOUT THAT I HAVE

20:06.862 --> 20:10.172
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHERE HER
HEAD IS AT.

20:10.206 --> 20:13.655
SHE'S BEEN LIKE THAT BLACK SHEEP
IN THE HOUSE EVERYONE HAS KIND

20:13.689 --> 20:19.586
OF AVOIDED AND NOW SHE HAS
POWERnd EVERYONE IS SCARED.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.000
BRITINI GIRL, WE IN DANGER,
GIRL.

20:21.034 --> 20:23.896
I MIGHT BE OUT THE DOOR WITH YOU
SOON.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.034
NO, I DON'T WANT TO GET HIT
AGAIN.

20:26.068 --> 20:29.482
WE JUST GOT HIT.

20:29.517 --> 20:31.724
THEY TOOK EVERYTHING.

20:31.758 --> 20:34.172
THEY PILLAGED US AND WE FINALLY
GOT EVERYTHING WE BUILT AGAINST

20:34.206 --> 20:36.827
AND WE'RE TRYING TO PUT
EVERYTHING-- WE AIN'T EVEN

20:36.862 --> 20:38.586
REBUILT, WE JUST GOT HIT TODAY.

20:38.620 --> 20:42.896
WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD TIME TO JUST
TRY TO RAISE UP OUR TENTS AGAIN.

20:42.931 --> 20:48.827
AND THEY ARE COMING AGAIN.

20:48.862 --> 20:52.241
THEY ARE COMING, THEY'RE
COMING.

20:52.275 --> 20:54.137
I JUST WANT-- LET ME GO.

20:54.172 --> 21:01.275
DON'T LET ME GO!

21:01.310 --> 21:03.793
I DIDN'T THINK CAN I TRUST
ANY OF THESE PEOPLE.

21:03.827 --> 21:08.689
I THINK ME AND YOU ARE ON EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THEIR-- EVERY

21:08.724 --> 21:14.724
PERSON ON THAT WALL, OTHER THAN
YOU, WOULD PUT ME UP.

21:14.758 --> 21:15.758
I AGREE.

21:15.793 --> 21:22.551
SO THE PEOPLE WHO SCARE ME
ARE-- ALYSSA AND.

21:22.586 --> 21:25.482
NOW WHICH ONE NEEDS TO GO,
I'M NOT SURE.

21:25.517 --> 21:28.482
SARAH BETH IS THROWING A LOT
OF NAMES OUT BUT THEY DON'T

21:28.517 --> 21:31.655
NECESSARILY ALIGN WITH WHO I
WOULD LIKE TO SEE GO THIS WEEK.

21:31.689 --> 21:35.448
IDEALLY CAN I CONVINCE SARAH
BETH TO TAKE OUT THE BIGGEST

21:35.482 --> 21:36.724
THREAT TO THE COOKOUT, DEREK X.

21:36.758 --> 21:41.206
I FIND MYSELF IN A PRECARIOUS
SITUATION BECAUSE I WANT TO SWAY

21:41.241 --> 21:47.862
SARAH BETH BUT I CAN'T EVER HAVE
HER FEEL LIKE I AM PRESSURING

21:47.896 --> 21:48.793
HER.

21:48.827 --> 21:50.137
X-ZAVIER IS NOT GOING TO COME
AFTER YOU.

21:50.172 --> 21:54.724
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS IN THIS
GAME THAT WOULD SURPRISE ME AS

21:54.758 --> 21:56.034
MUCH AS X TURNING ON YOU.

21:56.068 --> 21:57.931
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK HE
WOULD.

21:57.965 --> 22:02.103
THERE IS JUST NO WAY IT WOULD
MATCH HIS PERSONA TO BREAK THE

22:02.137 --> 22:08.034
LOYALTY THAT HE HAS WITH YOU.

22:08.068 --> 22:15.655
I'M NOT-- WHAT I CAN DO WITH
MY H.O.H. IS GET RID OF SOMEONE

22:15.689 --> 22:19.965
WHO IS MORE OF A THREAT TO ME.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.241
YEAH.

22:21.275 --> 22:26.413
WHEN I LOOK IN TERMS OF HIS
THREAT LEVEL TO U AND I THE MOST

22:26.448 --> 22:29.862
IMMINENT, THE BIGGEST WAY FOR
HIM TO BE GONE THIS WEEK IS ON

22:29.896 --> 22:31.172
THE BLOCK.

22:31.206 --> 22:33.655
NO, THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING,
HE IS GOING TO WIN, IF HE PLAYS

22:33.689 --> 22:35.724
THIS WEEK, HE IS WINNING.

22:35.758 --> 22:37.000
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

22:37.034 --> 22:41.482
SO ARE YOU SAYING KEEP HIM
OFF THE INITIAL NOM AND AS LONG

22:41.517 --> 22:46.172
AS HE DOESN'T WIN THE VETO HE IS
ELIGIBLE FOR THE BACK DOOR.

22:46.206 --> 22:48.482
YEAH, FOR MY PRIORITY IS
GETTING-- PRIORITY NUMBER TWO IS

22:48.517 --> 22:49.724
USING POWER.

22:49.758 --> 22:53.862
I JUST NEED TO PICK MY INITIAL
NOMINEE IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT

22:53.896 --> 23:01.034
SETS ME UP SO I THAT HAVE
OPTIONS FOR A BACK DOOR AFTER

23:01.068 --> 23:02.206
THE VETO.

23:02.241 --> 23:05.172
I'M THINKING OF PUTTING UP
TWO PAWNS.

23:05.206 --> 23:08.482
BECAUSE OF THE CHOPPING BLOCK
ROULETTE POWER I'M NOT REALLY

23:08.517 --> 23:11.896
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER MY
TARGET UNTIL AFTER THE VETO IS

23:11.931 --> 23:13.206
PLAYED.

23:13.241 --> 23:15.689
IF THE POWER GETS USED WHICH I'M
HOPING IT DURKS THE REPLACEMENT

23:15.724 --> 23:20.034
NOMINEE IS GOING TO BE RANDOM SO
IT JUST FEELS SAFEST TO KEEP MY

23:20.068 --> 23:23.896
OPTIONS OPEN AND PUT TWO PAWNS
ON THE BLOCK.

23:23.931 --> 23:32.827
I COULD POSSIBLY PUT A-- ON
DK-- THAT IS WHAT I AM LOOKING

23:32.862 --> 23:33.344
AT RIGHT NOW.

23:50.862 --> 24:15.344
HEY Y'ALL, TIME FOR THE
NOMINATION CEREMONY.

24:15.379 --> 24:18.103
THIS IS THE NOMINATION
CEREMONY.

24:18.137 --> 24:20.965
ST MY RESPONSIBILITY AS THE HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE TWO

24:21.000 --> 24:23.482
HOUSEGUESTS FOR EVICTION.

24:23.517 --> 24:28.034
IN MY NOMINATION BLOCK ARE THE
KEYS OF THE HOUSEGUESTS I'M

24:28.068 --> 24:30.448
NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

24:30.482 --> 24:34.517
I WILL TURN TWO KEYS TO LOCK IN
MY NOMINATION AND THEIR FACES

24:34.551 --> 24:37.827
WILL APPEAR ON THE MEMORY WALL.

24:37.862 --> 24:56.344
THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST I HAVE
NOMINATEED IS.

24:56.379 --> 25:12.862
THE NEXT HOIS HOUSEGUEST HAVE I
NOMINATED IS.

25:12.896 --> 25:19.551
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU DEREK F AND
YOU CLAIRE, THIS WEEK WAS

25:19.586 --> 25:22.379
COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE
THE CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE THAT

25:22.413 --> 25:26.000
COULD BE IN PLAY SO IT WAS
ABSOLUTELY NOT PERSONAL.

25:26.034 --> 25:29.241
IT HURTS TO DO IT TBAWS I
RESPECT BOTH OF YOU AS PEOPLE

25:29.275 --> 25:31.551
AND PLAYERS AND FRIENDS.

25:31.586 --> 25:38.965
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.724
I NOM NEATED DEREK F AND CLAIRE
BUT I AM NOT THINKING EITHER OF

25:43.758 --> 25:46.034
THEM WILL BE MY REAL TARGET THIS
WEEK.

25:46.068 --> 25:50.275
I AM REALLY LOOKING AT DEREK X
STILL, I DON'T THINK CAN I FULLY

25:50.310 --> 25:53.551
TRUST HIM PLUS I THINK HE IS
SMARTER THAN ME AND MORE

25:53.586 --> 25:56.344
ATHLETIC THAN ME SO GETTING HIM
OUT EARLIER RATHER THAN LATER

25:56.379 --> 25:59.586
MIGHT BE BEST FOR MY GAME.

25:59.620 --> 26:02.068
CLAIRE, CLAIRE.

26:02.103 --> 26:04.689
OBVIOUSLY YOU NEVER WANT TO
BE ON THE BLOCK.

26:04.724 --> 26:06.000
IT'S AWFUL.

26:06.034 --> 26:09.551
THAT SAID, WITH THE CHOPPING
BLOCK ROULETTE AND THEN VETO

26:09.586 --> 26:13.068
STILL BEING UP FOR GRABS, THERE
ARE MORE OPPORTUNITIES THAN EVER

26:13.103 --> 26:16.965
BEFORE THAT I COULD POTENTIALLY
COME OFF THE BLOCK AND IT IS WAY

26:17.000 --> 26:18.965
BETTER TO BE SITTING ON THE
BLOCK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

26:19.000 --> 26:23.827
WEEK THAN AT THE END OF THE WEEK
THAT'S ME.

26:23.862 --> 26:28.241
THERE IS NO WAY I CAN ALLOW
FOR TWO MEMBERS OF THE SIX TO BE

26:28.275 --> 26:29.931
ON THE BLOCK ON THURSDAY NIGHT.

26:29.965 --> 26:34.275
BUT IS IT IS OKAY IF WE JUST
HAVE ONE MEMBER OF THE SIX UP

26:34.310 --> 26:35.172
THERE FOR NOW.

26:35.206 --> 26:38.586
LOOK AT US.

26:38.620 --> 26:39.655
WE'RE BACK AGAIN.

26:39.689 --> 26:40.931
WOW.

26:40.965 --> 26:43.413
I'M NOT GOING TO LET SARAH
BETH DICTATE WHAT I AM GOING TO

26:43.448 --> 26:44.655
DO IN THIS GAME.

26:44.689 --> 26:50.206
SO LET HER PUT ME UP ON THE
BLOCK, I'M SO NOT GOING TO PLAY

26:50.241 --> 26:51.448
ROULETTE.

26:51.482 --> 26:55.310
I'M NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE
FORCE MY HEND HAND, I HAVE ZERO

26:55.344 --> 27:06.000
DOLLARS AND IT IS GO WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

27:06.034 --> 27:14.310
YOU DON'T COME OFF THE WHEEL
STILL-- .

27:14.344 --> 27:17.724
I AM NOT READY TO LET CLAIRE
GO THIS WEEK.

27:17.758 --> 27:21.448
SHE HAS BEEN MY BEST FRIEND IN
THIS HOUSE SINCE DAY ONE BUT I

27:21.482 --> 27:24.862
DON'T HAVE ANY BB BUCKS TO EVEN
SAVE HER.

27:24.896 --> 27:29.172
SO UNLESS AMERICA HELPS ME OUT
IN A REALLY BIG WAY, I WON'T BE

27:29.206 --> 27:30.275
ABLE TO PLAY.

27:30.310 --> 27:42.275
AND I WISH THAT I COULD DO MORE.

27:42.310 --> 27:48.793
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER PLAYS
ARE BUT RIGHT NOW, OKAY.

27:48.827 --> 27:54.620
I DON'T KNOW I JUST FEEL LIKE I
COULD BE A TARGET.

27:54.655 --> 28:00.655
FOR MY PERSONAL GAME I'M NOT
READY TO LET DEREK X GO BUT MY

28:00.689 --> 28:03.034
PRIMARY LOYALTY HAS ALWAYS BEEN
TO THE COOKOUT.

28:03.068 --> 28:05.965
DEREK X CANNOT PLAY IN CHOPPING
BLOCK ROULETTE BECAUSE NOT ONLY

28:06.000 --> 28:10.172
DOES THE WINNER GET SAFETY BUT
THEY GET TO PULL DOWN ONE OF THE

28:10.206 --> 28:11.310
NOMINEES.

28:11.344 --> 28:13.172
WE NEED TO KEEP AS MANY NN
COOKOUT MEMBERS AVAILABLE AS

28:13.206 --> 28:16.310
OPTIONS TO HIT THE BLOCK SO THAT
TWO MEMBERS OF THE COOKOUT

28:16.344 --> 28:22.206
AREN'T SITTING NEXT TO EACH
OTHER ON MY NOT.

28:22.241 --> 28:23.448
I HAVE TO PLAY.

28:23.482 --> 28:26.310
WHY WOULD YOU NOT PLAY.

28:26.344 --> 28:27.275
OKAY.

28:27.310 --> 28:28.482
IF ARE YOU SAFE THEN I WILL
PROBABLY PLAY.

28:28.517 --> 28:31.793
SO I COULD PLAY THE CHOPPING
BLOCK ROULETTE THIS WEEK AND

28:31.827 --> 28:35.551
GUARANTEE MY SEAFT BUT IF I DO,
THAT MEANS I MIGHT NOT HAVE

28:35.586 --> 28:39.172
ENOUGH MONEY TO PLAY THE GAME
NEXT WEEK WHICH IS EVEN MORE

28:39.206 --> 28:41.793
POWERFUL AND WOULD LOVE TO HAVE
THAT IN MY CONTROL.

28:41.827 --> 28:46.275
BUT IF I DON'T PLAY THE ROULETTE
AND MY NAME GETS PICKED BY THE

28:46.310 --> 28:49.517
WHEEL, SB BACK DOORS ME, I MIGHT
NOT EVEN MAKE IT TO NEXT WEEK.

29:02.172 --> 29:07.724
HI, EVERYBODY, THE HIGH
ROLLERS ROOM IS NOW OPEN.

29:07.758 --> 29:11.344
WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO THE ROOM
ONE BY ONE AND FIND OUT HOW MANY

29:11.379 --> 29:24.793
BB BUCKS AMERICA HAS AWARDED US.

29:24.827 --> 29:27.551
CLAIRE, WELCOME BACK TO THE
HIGH ROLLERS ROOM, SINCE THE

29:27.586 --> 29:32.172
VETO DERBY WAS WON LAST WEEK,
THAT GAME IS NOW CLOSED.

29:32.206 --> 29:36.344
THIS WEEK IF THERE IS ENOUGH BB
BUCKS IN YOUR BANK YOU COULD

29:36.379 --> 29:38.206
PLAY CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE.

29:38.241 --> 29:42.137
THE WINNER OF THIS POWER MUST
REMOVE ONE OF THE NOMINEES FROM

29:42.172 --> 29:43.758
THE CHOPPING BLOCK THIS WEEK.

29:43.793 --> 29:49.034
AND THE SPIN OF A ROULETTE WHEEL
WILL DETERMINE THEIR

29:49.068 --> 29:50.344
REPLACEMENT.

29:50.379 --> 29:53.586
OR YOU CAN CONTINUE TO BANK YOUR
BB BUCKS IN HOPES OF PLAYING FOR

29:53.620 --> 29:56.034
THE COIN OF DESTINY NEXT WEEK.

29:56.068 --> 29:59.724
IN THE HIGH ROLLERS ROOM
AMERICA HAS GIVEN EACH PLAYER A

29:59.758 --> 30:00.931
DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF BB BUCKS.

30:00.965 --> 30:05.862
WHICH WE CAN SPEND TO FLAY A
VARIETY OF GAMES TO WIN POWER.

30:05.896 --> 30:08.275
LAST WEEK VETO DERBY WAS PLAYED.

30:08.310 --> 30:11.068
THIS WEEK'S GAME, CHOPPING BLOCK
ROULETTE.

30:11.103 --> 30:14.620
PLEASE SCAN YOUR CARD TO SEE
HOW MANY BB BUCKS AMERICA HAS

30:14.655 --> 30:15.275
GIFTED YOU.

30:15.310 --> 30:16.620
ALL RIGHT.

30:16.655 --> 30:19.793
-YOU HAVE RECEIVED $100
-BB
BUCKS.

30:19.827 --> 30:20.896
OH MY GOSH.

30:20.931 --> 30:23.517
THAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT
MYSELF.

30:23.551 --> 30:24.310
I CAN'T LIE.

30:24.344 --> 30:26.448
IT'S BEEN A ROUGH-- A ROUGH
WEEK.

30:26.482 --> 30:30.344
YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH BB
BUCKS TO PLAY A GAME THIS WEEK.

30:30.379 --> 30:31.620
VERY WELL.

30:31.655 --> 30:35.689
THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I GOT A

30:35.724 --> 30:40.344
HUNDRED DOLLARS, THE MAXIMUM
AMOUNT, CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE

30:40.379 --> 30:42.344
COSTS $125 TO PLAY.

30:42.379 --> 30:45.379
SO I AM $25 BUCKS SHORT.

30:45.413 --> 30:49.241
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU ARE A BUCK
SHORT FOR LUNCH AND YOU HAVE TO

30:49.275 --> 30:50.413
FISH AROUND FOR QUARTERS.

30:50.448 --> 30:53.379
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE ANY
QUARTERS IN MY PANTS HERE.

30:53.413 --> 30:55.724
PLEASE HEAD BACK TO THE BB
HOUSE.

30:55.758 --> 30:57.344
RIGHT ON.

30:57.379 --> 31:00.137
-AZAH, YOU HAVE RECEIVED $50
-BB
BUCKS.

31:00.172 --> 31:05.241
-SINCE YOU HAD 50
-BB BUCKS LEFT
OVER FROM LAST WEEK, YOUR NEW

31:05.275 --> 31:06.862
-TOTAL IS 100
-BB BUCKS.

31:06.896 --> 31:15.413
YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH BB BUCKS
TO PLAY A GAME THIS WEEK.

31:15.448 --> 31:19.724
HAND-- HANNAH, YOU RECEIVED
-$75
-BB BUCKS.

31:19.758 --> 31:20.379
WHAT?

31:20.413 --> 31:21.068
AGAIN?

31:21.103 --> 31:23.310
AMERICA MAKES ME-- OH MY GOD.

31:23.344 --> 31:27.068
-YOUR NEW TOTAL IS 150
-BB
BUCKS.

31:27.103 --> 31:28.344
I'M RICH, OH MY GOD.

31:28.379 --> 31:31.000
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE.

31:31.034 --> 31:33.344
I HAVE DECIDED THAT I DON'T
WANT TO PLAY AND INSTEAD AND I

31:33.379 --> 31:41.275
WANT TO SAVE MY MONEY TO PLAY IN
COIN OF DESTINY NEXT WEEK.

31:41.310 --> 31:43.896
X-- XAVIER, YOU HAVE RECEIVED
-75
-BB BUCKS.

31:43.931 --> 31:48.448
ALL RIGHT, I WILL TAKE IT
-TWNS YOUR NEW TOTAL IS $150
-BB

31:48.482 --> 31:49.758
BUCKS.

31:49.793 --> 31:52.103
OKAY, I LIKE THAT, THAT MEANS
I'M STILL ELIGIBLE FOR THE COIN

31:52.137 --> 31:53.551
OF DESTINY.

31:53.586 --> 31:56.241
-EASY DECISION, I HAVE 150
-BB
BUCKS.

31:56.275 --> 31:58.896
I WANT TO POCKET THAT FOR NOW
AND SAVE THAT FOR NEXT WEEK,

31:58.931 --> 32:02.206
THAT WAY I COULD POTENTIALLY
PLAY IN THE COIN OF DESTINY

32:02.241 --> 32:03.448
COMPETITION.

32:03.482 --> 32:05.517
THE MORE MEMBERS OF THE COOKOUT
THAT CAN PLAY IN THE COIN OF

32:05.551 --> 32:09.689
DESTINY, THE BETTER FOR OUR
ALLIANCE.

32:09.724 --> 32:10.689
THANK YOU, AMERICA.

32:10.724 --> 32:11.724
APPRECIATE Y'ALL.

32:11.758 --> 32:15.413
SARAH BETH, YOU HAVE RECEIVED
-50
-BB BUCKS.

32:15.448 --> 32:20.103
SORRY, YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH BB
BUCKS TO PLAY A GAME THIS WEEK.

32:20.137 --> 32:23.103
HOPEFULLY WHOEVER IS IN POWER
NEXT WEEK, I WILL STAY SAFE.

32:23.137 --> 32:24.275
WE'LL SEE.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.413
WHAT HAPPENS.

32:26.448 --> 32:31.379
TIFFANY, YOU HAVE RECEIVED
-50
-BB BUCKS.

32:31.413 --> 32:34.551
-YOUR NEW TOTAL IS $75
-BB BUCKS.

32:34.586 --> 32:40.034
YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH BB BUCKS
TO PLAY A GAME THIS WEEK.

32:40.068 --> 32:44.034
ALYSSA, YOU HAVE RECEIVED
-$75
-BB BUCKS.

32:44.068 --> 32:44.758
YAY.

32:44.793 --> 32:47.068
OH MY GOD, FINALLY I'M LIKED.

32:47.103 --> 32:50.482
-YOUR NEW TOTAL IS $125
-BB BUCKS.

32:50.517 --> 32:51.551
YES.

32:51.586 --> 32:53.931
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE?

32:53.965 --> 32:59.517
I WOULD LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND
PLAY CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE.

32:59.551 --> 33:01.620
I WANT TO PLAY ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE BECAUSE

33:01.655 --> 33:05.034
I DON'T THINK I'M SOMEONE THAT
WILL HAVE ENOUGH TO PLAY IN THE

33:05.068 --> 33:08.241
NEXT POWER NEXT WEEK AND I WANT
TO ENSURE MY SAFETY OUT OF

33:08.275 --> 33:12.034
EVERYONE IN THIS HOUSE, X-ZAVIER
IS LITERALLY MY ONLY ALLY AND

33:12.068 --> 33:14.172
THE ONLY PERSON I COMPLETELY
TRUST.

33:14.206 --> 33:16.655
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE IS A
GAME OF BALANCE AND SKILL.

33:16.689 --> 33:19.482
HERE IS HOW IT WORKS.

33:19.517 --> 33:23.689
ON GO USE YOUR BODY TO ROLL THE
BALL AROUND THE TABLE.

33:23.724 --> 33:26.586
YOUR GOAL IS TO MOVE THE BALL
AROUND THE ROULETTE WHEEL AS

33:26.620 --> 33:30.862
MANY TIMES AS POSSIBLE BEFORE
YOUR TWO MINUTE CLOCK EXPIRES.

33:30.896 --> 33:34.206
THE WINNER OF CHOPPING BLOCK
ROULETTE WILL BE THE HOUSEGUEST

33:34.241 --> 33:38.551
WITH THE HIGHEST SCORE AT THE
END OF THE TWO MINUTES.

33:38.586 --> 33:43.034
REMEMBER, THE WINNER OF CHOPPING
BLOCK ROULETTE WILL BE SAFE FOR

33:43.068 --> 33:47.344
THE WEEK AND MUST REMOVE A
NOMINEE FROM THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

33:47.379 --> 33:50.344
THE REPLACEMENT NOMINEE WILL BE
DETERMINED BY THE SPIN OF THE

33:50.379 --> 33:51.344
ROULETTE WHEEL.

33:51.379 --> 34:05.689
GOOD LUCK.

34:05.724 --> 34:08.724
BE FOR THIS COMPETITION MY GOAL
IS TO GET THE BALL TO MAKE A

34:08.758 --> 34:11.103
COMPLETE LAP AS MANY TIMES AS
POSSIBLE.

34:11.137 --> 34:23.689
AND TO LOCK IN MY SCORE BEFORE
THE TWO MINUTES ARE UP.

34:23.724 --> 34:29.172
THE TABLE IS MUCH FLIMSIER THAN
I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE, A

34:29.206 --> 34:31.068
SINGLE MOVEMENT COMPLETELY TIPS
IT OVER.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.931
SO MY STRATEGY IS TO BE AS CLOSE
IN THE MIDDLE AS POSSIBLE AND

34:33.965 --> 34:43.310
KIND OF TILT BACK AND FORTH
RATHER THAN GOING IN A CIRCULAR

34:43.344 --> 34:46.931
MOTION.

34:46.965 --> 34:47.620
CLAIRE.

34:47.655 --> 34:50.275
KYLAND, YOU HAVE RECEIVED $50.

34:50.310 --> 34:53.551
-50
-BB BUCKS OKAY, I'M HOPE UG
TBAIF ME 50 BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST

34:53.586 --> 34:55.413
NOT WORRIED ABOUT ME BECAUSE I'M
DOING FINE.

34:55.448 --> 34:57.068
THAT IS WHAT I AM GOING TO
GUESS.

34:57.103 --> 35:00.172
YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH BB
BUCKS TO PLAY A GAME THIS WEEK.

35:00.206 --> 35:01.172
LATER.

35:01.206 --> 35:04.034
SARAH BETH, YOU HAVE RECEIVED
-$100
-BB BUCKS.

35:04.068 --> 35:07.517
-YOUR NEW TOTAL IS $150
-BB BUCKS.

35:07.551 --> 35:10.034
SO I AM ON THE BLOCK.

35:10.068 --> 35:13.517
AND I WANT TO GO FOR THE BIGGER
PRIZE.

35:13.551 --> 35:17.896
SO I AM NOT GOING TO PLAY AND
SAVE MY MONEY FOR THE NEXT

35:17.931 --> 35:19.206
COMPETITION.

35:19.241 --> 35:21.586
EVEN THOUGH I'M ON THE BLOCK, I
FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE THIS WEEK

35:21.620 --> 35:23.620
BECAUSE I HAVE AN ALLIANCE WITH
THE COOKOUT.

35:23.655 --> 35:27.310
HAVE I PEOPLE I'M WORKING WITH,
AND I WOULD RATHER BANK MY MONEY

35:27.344 --> 35:34.689
THIS WEEK SO I CAN COMPETE NEXT
WEEK IN THE COIN OF DESTINY.

35:34.724 --> 35:37.931
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

35:37.965 --> 35:43.275
I THINK THAT IF YOU PLAY YOU
WILL WINMENT AND IF YOU WIN I

35:43.310 --> 35:45.551
THINK THAT WOULD BE DOING
SOMETHING THAT THE H.O.H. HAS

35:45.586 --> 35:49.344
NOT ASKED YOU TO DO.

35:49.379 --> 35:50.586
PERSONALLY.

35:50.620 --> 35:52.310
IF DEREK X PLAYS AND WIN THIS
COMPETITION AND BROUGHT DOWN

35:52.344 --> 35:55.655
CLAIRE, THAT IS VIRTUALLY OUR
WORST-CASE SCENARIO.

35:55.689 --> 36:01.724
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE TWO PEOPLE
OUT OF THE THREE TARGETS THAT WE

36:01.758 --> 36:06.344
HAVE AVAILABLE TO US THIS WEEK
WHO WOULD NOW BE INELIGIBLE IT

36:06.379 --> 36:09.758
TO BE PUT UP ON THE BLOCK.

36:09.793 --> 36:14.034
ALL RIGHT, AMERICA, LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU GAVE ME.

36:14.068 --> 36:17.448
DEREK X YOU HAVE
RECEIVE-- DEREK F, YOU HAVE

36:17.482 --> 36:17.965
RECEIVED 100.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.034
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

36:19.068 --> 36:21.482
YOUR NEW TOTAL IS $200 BB
BUCKS.

36:21.517 --> 36:23.482
LET'S GO, THANK YOU.

36:23.517 --> 36:27.793
NOW THAT I HAVE 200 BB BUCKS
HAVE I A HUGE DECISION TO MAKE.

36:27.827 --> 36:32.241
SO I COULD SPEND $125 TO FLAY
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE WHICH

36:32.275 --> 36:35.655
WILL ALLOW ME TO PULL MYSELF OFF
THE BLOCK AND KEEP MYSELF SAFE

36:35.689 --> 36:39.103
BUT IF I SAVE FOR NEXT WEEK I'M
GUARANTEED TO PLAY THE COIN OF

36:39.137 --> 36:41.620
DESTINY WHICH IS BY FAR THE BEST
POWER THAT WE'VE SEEN.

36:41.655 --> 36:45.448
WHY IS EVERYTHING SO HARD IN
THIS GAME.

36:45.482 --> 36:48.862
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I AM GOING
TO DO.

36:48.896 --> 36:49.689
OH MAN.

36:56.379 --> 36:59.275
AMERICA GAVE ME A HUNDRED BB
BUCKS THIS WEEK WHICH MEANS HAVE

36:59.310 --> 37:03.034
I ENOUGH TO PLAY IN CHOPPING
BLOCK ROULETTE BUT IF I PLAY

37:03.068 --> 37:05.310
THIS WEEK THAN THAT MEANS I
MIGHT NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO

37:05.344 --> 37:08.482
PLAY NECK WEEK FOR ONE OF THE
BIGGEST POWERS THAT WE'VE SEEN

37:08.517 --> 37:09.724
IN THE GAME YET.

37:09.758 --> 37:14.172
FOR BETTER OR WORSE, I FEEL KIND
OF SAFE AND IF I DO PLAY THE

37:14.206 --> 37:18.241
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE THAT
WILL PUT ME DOWN TO $75 AND I

37:18.275 --> 37:21.241
WOULD NEED A HUNDRED NEXT WEEK
WHICH MEANS I WOULD NOT BE ABLE

37:21.275 --> 37:24.482
TO PLAY COIN OF DESTINY AND I
WANT TO GUN FOR THAT BECAUSE

37:24.517 --> 37:27.137
NEXT WEEK WILL BE A GREAT TIME
TO MAKE A BIG MOVE.

37:27.172 --> 37:30.724
AND IF I CAN DO IT HONESTLY AND
NOT GET BLOOD ON MY HANDS, THAT

37:30.758 --> 37:31.827
IS PERFECT FOR ME.

37:31.862 --> 37:34.172
I AM NOT PLAYING THE
ROULETTEMENT I WILL KEEP SAVING

37:34.206 --> 37:40.896
AND WE'RE GOING FOR THAT COIN OF
DESTINY.

37:40.931 --> 37:44.068
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE WAS
PLAYED IN THE HIGH ROLLERS ROOM

37:44.103 --> 37:49.206
AND THERE WAS A WINNER.

37:49.241 --> 37:51.448
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE.

37:51.482 --> 37:54.000
ONLY THE WINNER'S NAME IS
REVEALED SO WE DON'T ACTUALLY

37:54.034 --> 37:56.655
KNOW WHO SPENT THEIR MONEY, WHO
PLAYED.

37:56.689 --> 37:59.689
AND HOW MUCH MONEY EACH PERSON
IS LEFT WITH IN THIS GAME.

37:59.724 --> 38:02.413
AND THAT MAKES THINGS A LITTLE
TRICKY.

38:02.448 --> 38:14.551
WITH A HIGH SCORE OF 19, THE
WINNER IS-- ALYSSA.

38:14.586 --> 38:15.172
CONGRATULATIONS.

38:15.206 --> 38:16.448
ARE YOU SAFE FOR THE WEEK.

38:16.482 --> 38:20.034
I AM SO GLAD I WON CHOPPING
BLOCK ROULETTE, THAT ISER IN WIN

38:20.068 --> 38:24.344
ON MY BIG BROTHER RESUME, NOW
THAT I KNOW I'M SAFE HOPEFULLY

38:24.379 --> 38:27.517
THIS SPIN LANDS ON A TARGET THIS
WEEK AND MAYBE SOMEONE THAT I

38:27.551 --> 38:28.724
GOT MY EYES ON.

38:28.758 --> 38:32.172
PLEASE STAND AND NAME THE
NOMINEE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO

38:32.206 --> 38:35.344
TAKE OFF THE BLOCK.

38:35.379 --> 38:38.758
I WANT TO TAKE BIG D DOWN,
EVERYONE SEES HIM AS ITS

38:38.793 --> 38:41.931
ULTIMATE PAWN WHICH NO MATTER
WHO HE IS SITTING NEXT TO IS

38:41.965 --> 38:44.413
GOING HOME, SO CLEEFING CLAIRE
ON THE BLOCK GIVES WHOEVER IS ON

38:44.448 --> 38:48.103
THE BLOCK A FIGHTING CHANCE, I
AM HOPING THE SPIN GOES MY WAY,

38:48.137 --> 38:53.275
I DO NOT WANT TO LAND ON
X-ZAVIER'S SPACE AND SEE HIM ON

38:53.310 --> 38:54.862
THE BLOCK BECAUSE OF ME.

38:54.896 --> 38:57.206
ALYSSA, WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO
TAKE OFF THE BLOCK.

38:57.241 --> 39:02.206
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE DEREK
OFF THE BLOCK.

39:02.241 --> 39:03.482
THANK YOU.

39:03.517 --> 39:05.620
DEREK ARE YOU SAFE FOR THE
WEEK, PLEASE TAKE A SEAT ON THE

39:05.655 --> 39:06.586
COUCH.

39:06.620 --> 39:08.931
IT FEELS GREAT TO BE TAKEN
OFF THE BLOCK.

39:08.965 --> 39:11.137
ALYSSA, IT IS TIME TO GET THE
ROULETTE WHEEL.

39:11.172 --> 39:13.931
ALYSSA DIDN'T USE IT ON ME
LAST WEEK, SO WE ARE EVEN NOW,

39:13.965 --> 39:16.689
BABY AM I LOVE YOU FOR THAT.

39:16.724 --> 39:21.931
IT IS NOW TIME TO FIND OUT
WHO WOULD BE REPLACING DEREK X

39:21.965 --> 39:24.689
