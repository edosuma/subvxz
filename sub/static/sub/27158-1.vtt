00:09.443 --> 00:10.476
17 years ago,

00:10.511 --> 00:13.412
I started this company out
of a studio apartment,

00:13.447 --> 00:15.080
with nothing
but a tiny savings

00:15.116 --> 00:18.050
and an insatiable appetite
for shoes.

00:19.987 --> 00:22.788
But, one person alone
cannot accomplish

00:22.823 --> 00:25.324
what we have built together.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.494
And it's because of all of you

00:28.529 --> 00:32.197
that I was made an offer
I could not refuse.

00:32.232 --> 00:35.367
That's why you, along
with the new owners,

00:35.403 --> 00:39.004
are going to take Madd Shoes
straight into the stratosphere.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.676
So, thank you to all of you,

00:44.712 --> 00:47.312
for making my dreams
come true.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.313
Cheers.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.115
Cheers.

00:53.954 --> 00:54.920
Okay.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.922
Let's do this.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:08.836 --> 01:10.836
So that's that.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.989
Oh...

01:31.025 --> 01:33.859
I don't have to get up.

01:33.894 --> 01:37.663
I can go back to sleep
for three hours if I want to.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.598
Hmm.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.670
Okay, I'm up.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.712
Okay.

01:53.747 --> 01:57.049
No messages.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.790
Hi, Mom.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.126
So, how does it feel?

02:07.161 --> 02:08.860
How does what feel?

02:08.895 --> 02:11.296
Your first day of freedom.

02:11.332 --> 02:14.433
Uh, I don't know.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.667
Numb.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.870
That's not how it's supposed
to be.

02:17.905 --> 02:21.406
What are you doing
right this second?

02:21.442 --> 02:22.574
I'm in the park,

02:22.610 --> 02:25.777
watching an adorable family play
in the snow.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.814
Sounds appropriate
for this time of year.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.917
So this is...
free time, huh?

02:31.952 --> 02:34.219
It's, uh, unsettling.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.854
Life is what happens
while you're busy

02:35.890 --> 02:37.623
making other plans...

02:37.658 --> 02:39.758
Or, putting out your own
shoe line.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.026
<i>You worked hard, Maddie,</i>

02:41.061 --> 02:43.395
<i>and you got what
you always wanted.</i>

02:43.430 --> 02:44.997
<i>But what do I do now?</i>

02:45.032 --> 02:47.399
Maddie, I'm gonna be blunt.

02:47.434 --> 02:48.367
Well, of course you are.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.801
That's what you do.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.236
Come home, honey.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.339
Navigate the in-between
with your family.

02:54.375 --> 02:58.177
Let life dominate your life
for once.

02:58.212 --> 03:01.547
Okay, I'll come home
for Christmas.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.814
Thanks, Mom.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.053
Listen up, everyone.

03:08.088 --> 03:10.189
Maddie is coming home
for the holidays,

03:10.224 --> 03:15.227
but it's not her usual in
and out in one day, um...

03:15.262 --> 03:18.797
She's in a bit of a transition
and she needs some family time,

03:18.832 --> 03:23.368
so we're going to welcome her
with some hometown hospitality.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.636
Okay?

03:24.672 --> 03:25.504
<i>Hey, Peg?</i>

03:26.240 --> 03:28.440
How am I supposed to stay away?

03:28.475 --> 03:29.908
You know, a 24-hour visit
is one thing,

03:29.944 --> 03:31.243
but I run the workshop

03:31.278 --> 03:34.012
and this is a lot more
than just a quick hello.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.981
Well, you can't stay away,
Carter.

03:36.016 --> 03:39.918
That's just the bare bones
of it.

03:39.954 --> 03:42.387
Yeah, I know.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.756
After all these years
and she still hates me.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.659
Hate is a strong word, but...

03:47.695 --> 03:50.028
When you let someone go
with nothing but a train ticket

03:50.064 --> 03:51.997
and a broken heart,

03:52.032 --> 03:55.367
that's not something one can
get over very easily.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.902
Yeah, I get it.

03:56.937 --> 04:02.574
The holidays are the perfect
time for forgiveness, though.

04:02.610 --> 04:07.412
Well, we'll see how well
that goes over.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.015
Hmm.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.223
Thanks, Trent.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.190
You okay, Maddie?

04:19.226 --> 04:20.858
Yeah, I just don't know
what kind of reception

04:20.894 --> 04:22.828
I'll be walking into.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.897
Yeah, well, it's not like you've
never gone home before.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.966
It's usually just
for Christmas day.

04:28.002 --> 04:29.701
An extended walk down
memory lane might have

04:29.737 --> 04:32.738
a few unexpected
twists and turns.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.006
I understand.

04:34.875 --> 04:35.574
Thank you.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.142
Good.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.041
<i>Hello?</i>

06:19.012 --> 06:22.314
Maddie?

06:22.349 --> 06:23.548
Hi, Carter.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.184
What are you doing hiding
behind a tree?

06:26.220 --> 06:27.886
Oh, I'm... I'm not hiding.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.654
I was...

06:29.690 --> 06:31.890
uh, looking for my watch.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.793
Uh, it's right there
on your wrist.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.461
I know.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.096
Because I put it there.

06:38.132 --> 06:41.133
It... fell off,
and I had to go get it.

06:41.168 --> 06:41.933
And I did.

06:41.969 --> 06:45.737
And then I put it back on,
and...

06:45.773 --> 06:48.940
It's all good.
Problem solved.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.108
Oh, and you brought
your bags

06:50.144 --> 06:51.710
over there with you
to look for it.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.912
All three of them.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.248
What's with the interrogation?

06:56.283 --> 06:58.250
Hey, I'm not interrogating,
there's just a couple holes

06:58.285 --> 06:59.618
in your story, that's all.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.720
Only if you're looking for them.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.488
It's actually pretty
cut and dry.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.724
You drop something
and you go pick it up.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.426
Well, it must have flown off
your wrist to make it

07:07.461 --> 07:09.394
all the way over there
by the tree.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.495
Okay Carter, I...

07:10.531 --> 07:13.932
I don't feel like I have
to explain myself to you.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.534
Okay, look, you're right,
I'm sorry.

07:15.569 --> 07:18.837
This is awkward,
and...

07:18.872 --> 07:19.838
<i>Uncle Carter?</i>

07:19.873 --> 07:21.239
You forgot your scarf.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.240
Thanks.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.843
Why are you talking
to a tree?

07:27.314 --> 07:29.047
Maddie, remember my niece,
Ava?

07:29.082 --> 07:31.883
Yes, but you probably
don't remember me.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.685
You were little the last time
I saw you.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.987
I'm a huge fan of Madd Shoes.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.456
I saved up my allowance
for six months

07:37.491 --> 07:39.124
to buy those lace-up boots.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.091
I love them.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.293
Oh.

07:41.328 --> 07:46.231
Well, I could get you a pair
from the warehouse for free.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.599
Oh no, I...

07:47.634 --> 07:49.801
I actually don't think
I can do that anymore.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.937
Uh, well maybe I could get you
a discount.

07:51.972 --> 07:52.871
That would be great.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.539
I am a fashion design junkie.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.740
I make my own dresses.

07:55.776 --> 07:56.741
Oh.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.043
Well, I'd love to see
them sometime.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.178
Okay, I'll show you.

08:00.214 --> 08:01.346
Can I have the keys?

08:01.381 --> 08:02.747
No, because it just
started snowing,

08:02.783 --> 08:04.049
which means the roads
are icy,

08:04.084 --> 08:06.117
and your mother said
"no driving on the ice."

08:06.153 --> 08:07.652
My mom's not back
till Sunday.

08:07.688 --> 08:08.887
She'll never know.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.555
Besides, I need to learn
how to drive it

08:10.591 --> 08:14.125
in inclement weather eventually.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.495
Fine, fine.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.429
You can start the truck,

08:17.464 --> 08:19.231
but do not go anywhere
until I get there.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.333
Got it.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.837
I've been watching Ava while
my sister's flying, you know.

08:25.873 --> 08:26.771
20 years in the airlines,

08:26.807 --> 08:28.607
hard to find another job
that pays the same

08:28.642 --> 08:30.175
and keeps you in one place,
so...

08:30.210 --> 08:31.409
I admire your sister.

08:31.445 --> 08:34.246
It's, uh, not easy
being a single parent,

08:34.280 --> 08:35.679
and Ava seems great.

08:35.716 --> 08:36.548
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:36.582 --> 08:40.018
So, this, uh,
should be interesting.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.852
It's fine.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.955
We're both adults.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.590
I can handle it,
you can handle it,

08:45.626 --> 08:47.826
and it's just for the holidays.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.127
Yeah, you're right.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.195
Um...

08:50.230 --> 08:53.798
I'll give you as much distance
as possible and...

08:55.302 --> 08:56.434
Uh, I should...

08:56.470 --> 08:57.569
I should, too.

08:57.604 --> 08:59.704
Get inside and say hi
to my family.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.539
Yeah, okay.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.440
Ya... you want some help
with the bags?

09:02.476 --> 09:04.776
No. I'm good, thank you.

09:04.811 --> 09:05.944
Okay.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.112
Keep an eye on that watch
so it doesn't go flying out

09:07.147 --> 09:08.480
by any trees.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.117
I thought I heard voices
out here.

09:12.152 --> 09:12.884
Hi, Mom.

09:12.920 --> 09:16.388
Maddie, oh honey.
Oh.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.690
I am so happy
to have you home.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.761
I mean, really home,
for all of Christmas.

09:22.796 --> 09:26.398
My family is here.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.866
My extended family too.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.768
All the most important
people in my life,

09:29.803 --> 09:32.437
all in the same place.

09:32.472 --> 09:35.740
I think this is going to be
our best Christmas yet.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.816
Hello?

09:44.851 --> 09:47.485
Hi, Katie!

09:47.521 --> 09:48.887
Aunt Maddie!

09:50.057 --> 09:51.189
Hi.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.859
Aunt Maddie, look at my shoes.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.430
Oh my goodness, are those
the ones that I sent you?

09:58.465 --> 09:59.531
Yeah.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.000
They barely fit her anymore,
her feet grow so fast.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.368
Well, we are going to have
to get you

10:03.403 --> 10:05.203
a new pair for Christmas.

10:06.273 --> 10:06.538
Billie.

10:06.573 --> 10:07.472
Maddie.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.374
- Aw.
- Merry Christmas.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.042
Merry Christmas.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.745
And, Hallie.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.513
Merry Christmas.

10:15.549 --> 10:17.282
Merry Christmas.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.820
It's, it's good to have you
home, Maddie.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.288
It's nice to be home.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.324
And I'm... I'm looking forward
to spending time with you.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.359
Well, sure.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.961
If... if you have time.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.563
It turns out, I do have time.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.531
Plenty of time.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.767
Maybe we could go
Christmas shopping,

10:35.802 --> 10:40.105
or, or something, like we used
to do when you were a kid.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.706
Oh.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.174
Ah, that sounds great.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.709
Yeah, great.

10:44.745 --> 10:48.046
All my kids, my son-in-law,
and my grand-baby,

10:48.081 --> 10:50.315
all under the same roof.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.717
Oh, I have so many plans
for us.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.291
You have that, Mom?

11:00.327 --> 11:01.326
What have you got in here?

11:01.361 --> 11:02.394
I have a lot of shoes.

11:04.564 --> 11:05.697
Ignore the mess.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.198
Your sister has to wrap in here,

11:07.234 --> 11:08.900
so that Katie won't see
all her presents

11:08.935 --> 11:11.936
before Christmas morning,
and...

11:11.972 --> 11:13.304
if there's not enough space,

11:13.340 --> 11:14.439
I can empty out some
more drawers.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.608
Oh, no, no, it's fine, don't go
out of your way for me.

11:17.711 --> 11:18.943
I know it's not the Four Seasons
and you're used to

11:18.979 --> 11:20.345
something a little fancier.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.713
Mom, I don't care about that.

11:21.748 --> 11:24.315
I'm just here to see all of you.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.786
Oh my goodness, you really don't
throw anything away.

11:27.821 --> 11:28.586
Ehh...

11:29.423 --> 11:31.222
I'm afraid to look
in these boxes,

11:31.258 --> 11:32.857
so many skeletons.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.160
It's okay, they don't bite.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.028
Oh, my baton.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.230
Do you remember how bad
I was at this?

11:39.266 --> 11:41.966
I did a toss, and I sent Coach
Hyde to the emergency room

11:42.002 --> 11:43.868
during the homecoming game.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.470
I remember.
Put it down.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.306
Safety first.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.342
There's no skeletons here,
only memories.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.913
I just don't see any sense
in throwing away the past.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.614
Even the mistakes?

11:56.650 --> 11:58.583
There are no mistakes,
Maddie.

11:58.618 --> 12:02.387
Only decisions.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.657
Well, that was uncomfortable
outside,

12:05.692 --> 12:07.592
and don't tell me
you didn't feel it.

12:07.627 --> 12:08.827
It was bound to happen.

12:08.862 --> 12:09.728
He's practically family,

12:09.763 --> 12:12.030
and just because you didn't
marry him

12:12.065 --> 12:13.531
doesn't make it any less so.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.834
I didn't marry him
because he didn't ask me.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.969
And, would you have stayed
in Claremont if he had?

12:18.004 --> 12:20.038
Well, I guess we'll never know,
because he made that decision

12:20.073 --> 12:24.342
for both of us when he decided
not to come with me.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.777
I was going to be the next
Jimmy Choo,

12:25.812 --> 12:27.312
and he was going to make
custom furniture

12:27.347 --> 12:29.481
for everyone in Manhattan.

12:29.516 --> 12:33.017
Gosh, we had big dreams,
and...

12:33.053 --> 12:34.786
and then it was just over.

12:34.821 --> 12:39.224
I think some people are maybe
afraid of their own power.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.725
Their talent.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.527
They think all they can ever be
is small,

12:42.562 --> 12:44.829
so they don't even try.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.398
That is definitely not
my Maddie, though.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.735
I am so proud of
what you've built.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.404
Carter could have built
something, too.

12:53.440 --> 12:58.610
Like I said, no mistakes,
only decisions.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.045
Right.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.747
<i>Ha, ha, ha!</i>

13:09.890 --> 13:11.956
Mine isn't as good as yours.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.325
Well, it doesn't have to be
perfect, Katie.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.995
All snowflakes are unique
and beautiful.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.164
<i>Just like you.</i>

13:19.199 --> 13:20.265
Oh. Hello.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.032
Hey.

13:21.067 --> 13:21.966
- Good morning.
- Hi.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.434
You still make those
snowflake pancakes?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.804
Oh, around Christmas,
every single morning.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.272
You wanna help tomorrow?

13:27.307 --> 13:31.276
My help in the kitchen tends
not to be very helpful.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.978
Let's just say the New York Fire
Department has been to my home,

13:34.014 --> 13:34.946
and leave it at that.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.650
Okay, let's get going
before you are late for camp.

13:38.685 --> 13:39.284
Okay.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.019
Katie is doing music camp.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.687
She wants to learn the piano.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.790
You played the piano,
didn't you?

13:45.826 --> 13:47.826
Flute.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.594
Right.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.728
Okay, bye Grandma.

13:50.764 --> 13:52.297
Bye Grandma,
bye Aunt Maddie.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.598
Bye, have fun!

13:53.633 --> 13:54.899
Bye, honey.

13:54.935 --> 13:55.800
Chilly!

13:55.836 --> 13:57.268
Do you want a snowflake pancake?

13:57.304 --> 13:59.237
I thought you'd never ask.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.305
Aha!

14:10.283 --> 14:12.817
So. You can still take a piece
of wood

14:12.853 --> 14:15.553
and turn it into a work of art.

14:15.589 --> 14:16.855
Uh, it's, it's nothing.

14:16.890 --> 14:19.524
It's, uh, it's a hobby.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.827
It wasn't always supposed
to be that way, though.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.863
Well, life happens.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.498
Carter, two new orders
just came in.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.868
A desk and a chair.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.536
All right, what's
the turnaround time?

14:31.571 --> 14:33.805
Mild rush?

14:33.840 --> 14:35.907
Look, I know how busy you are
multitasking with the orders

14:35.942 --> 14:37.475
and getting the barn set up
for the dance,

14:37.510 --> 14:39.010
so I'm gonna bring in
some extra help.

14:39.045 --> 14:39.677
No, no, no, no, no.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.479
We can't afford extra help.

14:41.514 --> 14:42.714
I got this, I can handle it.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.783
There was some water damage
in the gym at the high school,

14:45.819 --> 14:48.519
and they need a new location
for the holiday formal,

14:48.555 --> 14:50.722
so, we're letting them
use the barn.

14:50.757 --> 14:53.758
Ava was on the committee,
so Carter volunteered to help.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.027
I don't know if volunteer is
exactly the word I would use.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.463
You know, "assigned,"
"delegated."

14:58.498 --> 14:59.797
"Forced labour," actually.

14:59.833 --> 15:00.865
He volunteered.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.902
Which we appreciate,
and it's just for the week.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.938
Then you have your free time
back to work on your own stuff.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.007
Well, that's nice of you to do
for the community.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.642
Oh, don't compliment us
just yet.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.876
With everything going on,

15:11.912 --> 15:13.411
I have no idea how
we're gonna pull it off.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.946
The dance is less than
a week away.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.781
It's all too much.

15:16.816 --> 15:20.785
Maybe after Christmas this year,
it's time for me to retire.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.221
She says this every three days.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.489
We could sell the business.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.690
Like Maddie just did.

15:26.693 --> 15:29.160
I've always wanted to go
to France.

15:29.195 --> 15:30.228
I don't want to travel.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.229
I love our business.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.530
And you can go to France now,

15:32.565 --> 15:34.699
I can handle the day to day
of the business.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.334
It's too much work
for one person.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.969
Mom, I'll figure it out.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.104
You need to make
a definitive decision.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.006
Stop riding the fence.

15:42.042 --> 15:45.610
I can help, as long
as I'm here.

15:45.645 --> 15:46.978
You know, when I started
my own company,

15:47.013 --> 15:48.646
I was a one-woman show.

15:48.682 --> 15:51.382
I did sales, marketing,
accounting.

15:51.418 --> 15:54.118
You're all so busy, and
I'm not doing anything.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.520
Let me help.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.555
Okay.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.857
Maddie can take over the dance
with Carter.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.059
- She can?
- I can?

16:01.094 --> 16:03.828
Well, you organized this event
yourself your senior year.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.697
Well, that, that's true,
but, uh,

16:05.732 --> 16:09.000
my more recent experience is
a little more corporate based.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.468
But this is where you're going
to be the most help,

16:10.503 --> 16:11.703
and you know you're going
to do

16:11.738 --> 16:13.638
a way better job
than Carter could.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.273
<i>Mm, no offence.</i>

16:15.308 --> 16:17.241
Yeah, none taken.

16:19.212 --> 16:23.581
Well, I did set the bar pretty
high for future classes.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.083
Man, it was a lot of work.

16:25.118 --> 16:28.086
I didn't even get to dance,
not one song.

16:28.121 --> 16:28.953
Yeah, I remember.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.621
After we were crowned
king and queen,

16:30.657 --> 16:32.924
I tried to get you out
on that dance floor.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.425
So, Maddie?

16:34.461 --> 16:35.660
What do you say?

16:35.695 --> 16:38.162
You in?

16:38.198 --> 16:39.464
Sure.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.832
I'd love to help.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.433
Great.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.335
Hm.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.077
I'm doing this for my family.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.112
Yeah, me too.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.014
And I'm running point.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.615
Uh, you wouldn't have it
any other way.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.385
Well, I did do this once before,
and I was pretty good at it.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.420
Several decades ago.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.888
It's like riding a bike.

17:03.923 --> 17:06.223
You know, I don't know if
you remember this about me,

17:06.259 --> 17:09.894
but if I put my mind to it,
I can do anything.

17:09.929 --> 17:12.497
As evidenced by
all of your success.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.564
Great.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.867
Then I suggest you buckle up
and follow my lead.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.667
Yes Ma'am. Lead the way.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.803
Mmhmm.

17:18.838 --> 17:19.971
Oh!

17:20.006 --> 17:22.440
Yeah, I think I'll skip
that part.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.045
Well, one thing you haven't lost
is grace.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.821
Well, according to this email
from the principal,

17:36.856 --> 17:38.623
the sprinklers went off
and ruined,

17:38.658 --> 17:40.091
uh, well, everything.

17:40.126 --> 17:41.959
Yeah, the decorations, light,
the whole deal.

17:41.995 --> 17:43.394
What, so we're starting
from scratch?

17:43.430 --> 17:45.630
We are, with a limited budget
to boot.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.098
Well, how much have you done?

17:47.133 --> 17:47.899
A little.

17:47.934 --> 17:48.533
How little?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.601
Uh, I, uh, swept the barn.

17:50.637 --> 17:53.738
Carter? We have a week.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.406
I'm aware of that information.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.542
To plan an entire dance.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.344
Mm, yeah. Seems that way.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.846
What's the theme?

18:01.881 --> 18:03.714
Uh...

18:03.750 --> 18:05.216
Christmas.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.652
That's not a theme,
that's a season.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.387
Yeah, but it's a good
a theme as any.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.621
Right? It's easy.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.457
A couple wreaths,
some lights, boom.

18:12.492 --> 18:13.658
Call it a day.

18:13.693 --> 18:17.662
This is one of the last pivotal
events of their childhood.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.163
We have to do this right.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.932
Maddie. It's a dance.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.667
They want to get dressed up,
get their hair done,

18:22.702 --> 18:25.002
take a couple spins around
the barn with their crush.

18:25.038 --> 18:27.371
Carter, what happened to you?

18:27.407 --> 18:30.608
Where is your sense
of sentimentality?

18:30.643 --> 18:34.779
These are the days that they
are going to remember forever.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.414
We are going to pick out
a theme,

18:36.449 --> 18:42.086
and, together,
execute it flawlessly.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.055
Yes Ma'am.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.728
♪ <i>It's Christmas,</i>
<i>you know</i> ♪

18:50.763 --> 18:53.397

19:03.643 --> 19:05.676
Ah, I got, uh, lights.

19:05.712 --> 19:06.811
And in the absence of a theme

19:06.846 --> 19:10.014
I thought we could start
hanging those around the barn.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.115
Did you get what you need?

19:11.151 --> 19:12.250
I did.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.751
Sandwiches.

19:13.786 --> 19:14.785
Committee's gotta eat.

19:14.821 --> 19:15.486
Hmm.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.754
You know, I think this is a...

19:16.789 --> 19:19.223
this is a really good thing that
you're doing for your family.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.591
Now that you're
in somewhat of a,

19:20.627 --> 19:23.327
uh, break, a vacation.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.495
Uh, I'm happy to help.

19:24.531 --> 19:27.765
Everyone works at the business,
I'm just hanging around.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.768
I don't like feeling useless.

19:30.803 --> 19:34.338
Well, come on Maddie,
you can never be useless.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.474
Don't do that.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.708
Do what?

19:37.744 --> 19:39.143
Be nice to me.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.379
I'm sorry, you want me to call
you a couple choice names

19:41.414 --> 19:42.847
to make up for it?

19:44.817 --> 19:47.952
Okay, let's just focus
on a theme.

19:47.987 --> 19:53.891
Ah... How about
Christmas Masquerade?

19:53.927 --> 19:55.092
Come on.

19:55.128 --> 19:56.060
You think they want to spend
all that time getting ready

19:56.095 --> 19:59.530
just so they can cover
their face with a mask?

19:59.566 --> 20:00.464
Aha.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.066
Aha, see, I'm right.

20:02.101 --> 20:05.603
Look at you, you know I'm right,
but you hate to admit it.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.039
Let's see.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.707
What about, uh, a Winter
Wonderland theme?

20:09.742 --> 20:10.975
Great idea.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.243
I'm sure it was a great idea
last year,

20:12.278 --> 20:15.780
and the year before that, and
probably the year before that.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.749
Okay, fine. We're even.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.185
<i>What can we come up with
that they haven't done before?</i>

20:21.221 --> 20:22.153
I don't know.

20:22.188 --> 20:22.987
I'm not a party planner,
that's not my forte.

20:23.022 --> 20:27.491
Running a workshop?
That, I can do.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.560
Carter, that's it!

20:29.596 --> 20:31.162
That's brilliant!

20:31.197 --> 20:32.163
Of course it is.

20:32.198 --> 20:33.965
I came up with it.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.500
Mind telling me what
my brilliant idea was?

20:36.536 --> 20:38.069
We do the North Pole.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.705
We dress the barn up
like Santa's workshop.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.673
We'll do things like
Mrs. Claus's photo booth,

20:42.709 --> 20:44.909
reindeer snacks,
stuff like that.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.345
I could fabricate an exterior
outside the barn.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.513
Make it look just
like Santa's village.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.315
I love it. Santa's village.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.950
Perfect.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.452
I'm not dressing like an elf,
though.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.187
I wasn't going to ask you to.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.990
You're, uh, a little tall
to be an elf.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.592
Okay. Yup. Count me in.

21:01.628 --> 21:02.994
Wow, I really am a genius,
huh?

21:03.029 --> 21:04.395
Okay, don't let it go
to your head.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.098
We still have to execute
your little plan.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.636
I think it's going to be
beautiful.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.272
We found some amazing
decorations.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.574
So, you and Carter are working
well together.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.209
Yeah, we're managing.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.677
I mean, I've run a company
for 17 years,

21:19.712 --> 21:22.513
I've learned to navigate
all kinds of personality types.

21:22.548 --> 21:26.717
Not one that you have this kind
of history with.

21:26.753 --> 21:31.722
I never saw two kids more
in love than you and Carter.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.759
Well, he took care of that,
didn't he?

21:34.794 --> 21:36.961
I think you two need to talk.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.596
Get some closure.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.231
What's the point of rehashing
a relationship

21:40.266 --> 21:41.832
that happened 20 years ago?

21:41.868 --> 21:44.435
'Cause you need to deal with
the elephant in the room.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.337
No elephants. I'm a dog person.

21:46.372 --> 21:49.106
Stop changing the subject.

21:49.142 --> 21:52.009
There's so much between
you two that remains unspoken.

21:52.045 --> 21:53.177
And you know what happens

21:53.212 --> 21:55.313
when you leave things
bottled up inside.

21:55.348 --> 21:56.847
Yes, they explode.

21:56.883 --> 21:57.982
Mmhmm.

21:58.017 --> 22:01.819
So, cut it off before you
get to the breaking point.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.423
Hey!

22:05.458 --> 22:06.557
Hi.

22:06.592 --> 22:07.291
All right.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.426
Goodnight Mom, Maddie.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.994
Uh, I thought that Billy
was working late

22:10.029 --> 22:11.395
and you two were staying
for dinner.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.863
Uh, he finished his shift early,

22:12.899 --> 22:14.198
so we're gonna go have
dinner with him.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.399
Huh?

22:15.435 --> 22:17.702
Don't forget the Christmas
cookie swap on Wednesday night.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.970
Well, it's my most favourite
night of the year.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.739
How could I forget?

22:21.774 --> 22:25.309
I'm gonna do lots of baking
after this little one is asleep.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.812
We'll miss you at dinner.

22:27.847 --> 22:28.679
Yeah.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.047
Another time.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.248
High five!

22:31.284 --> 22:33.017
Goodnight, Katie girl.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.452
Bye.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.454
Goodnight, ladies.

22:38.424 --> 22:40.324
Okay.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.259
Speaking of bottled up,
she barely talks to me.

22:42.295 --> 22:43.694
Why does she hate me?

22:43.730 --> 22:45.162
Maddie, she doesn't hate you.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.731
She misses you.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.133
She was just so young
when you left,

22:49.168 --> 22:52.370
she would get so excited
every time you came home.

22:52.405 --> 22:53.738
But, I...

22:53.773 --> 22:55.072
Wasn't present.

22:55.108 --> 22:56.607
I let my job take
over everything,

22:56.642 --> 22:58.976
and now I'm a stranger
to my sister.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.711
Hallie does want to connect.

23:00.747 --> 23:01.746
She just...

23:01.781 --> 23:04.115
She doesn't know how.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.317
I'll try harder with her.

23:06.352 --> 23:08.652
I think that would be nice.

23:20.299 --> 23:21.766
Hey, Carter.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.467
You're here early.

23:23.503 --> 23:24.635
You know what they say.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.670
"The early bird works on his
own stuff on his own time,

23:26.706 --> 23:29.106
"so the boss doesn't
get angry."

23:29.142 --> 23:30.241
Oh, yeah.

23:30.276 --> 23:34.712
I think I saw that on a
motivational poster somewhere.

23:34.747 --> 23:35.880
What are you making?

23:35.915 --> 23:39.583
Oh, it's, uh, it's nothing.

23:39.619 --> 23:42.219
Didn't look like nothing.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.789
Your work is never nothing.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.891
You don't need to go there,
Maddie.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.125
Go where?

23:48.161 --> 23:49.794
To the pity zone.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.429
I saw the look on your face.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.764
What are you talking about?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.933
I don't pity you.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.902
I've always thought you were
incredibly talented.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.004
That you could do so much.

24:00.039 --> 24:03.174
Well, not everybody needs
validation from their careers.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.342
Carter, that is not what I said.

24:05.378 --> 24:07.278
Come on, we should get started.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.891
♪ <i>Deck the halls</i>
<i>with boughs of holly...</i> ♪

24:20.927 --> 24:23.027
Your decorating committee
has arrived.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.028
Put me to work.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.062
But, not too much work.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.864
I'm super lazy.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.432
Just kidding.
Huge work ethic.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.266
Maddie.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.469
Natalie. So good to see you.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.504
I have to tell you,
Ava is great.

24:33.539 --> 24:34.905
I would have to agree
with you there.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.041
Thank you, and thanks
for taking this on.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.042
I have flights this week,

24:38.077 --> 24:40.478
but I will pop in and help
as much as I can.

24:40.513 --> 24:42.279
And, I brought my sketches.

24:42.315 --> 24:43.547
I'll show you later, but...

24:43.583 --> 24:46.283
I'm making my own dress for the
dance and I want your advice.

24:46.319 --> 24:47.017
Ava!

24:47.053 --> 24:47.818
Maddie's a professional.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.286
You shouldn't bother her
with that.

24:49.322 --> 24:50.120
Oh, it's okay.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.156
I mentor a lot of
young designers.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.090
I'm fine with it.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.726
Thanks, Maddie.
I appreciate it.

24:58.498 --> 25:02.166
I just don't want her heart
broken if she's not good enough.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.869
She has this fantasy of going
to the Fashion Institute

25:04.904 --> 25:06.370
in New York.

25:06.405 --> 25:07.471
I understand.

25:07.507 --> 25:10.207
And I will be honest with her
about her sketches,

25:10.243 --> 25:12.209
but gentle.

25:19.252 --> 25:20.484
So?

25:20.520 --> 25:22.820
Are they any good?

25:22.855 --> 25:24.054
Good?

25:24.090 --> 25:25.789
Ava, they're stunning.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.258
You think so?

25:27.293 --> 25:28.492
Yes.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.227
I've seen a lot of sketches
from up and coming designers,

25:30.263 --> 25:32.496
and these are as good
as it gets.

25:32.532 --> 25:34.798
Your mom said you want to go
to the Fashion Institute?

25:34.834 --> 25:36.667
Yeah, but, I didn't apply.

25:36.702 --> 25:40.037
I mean, like she says, they
only take 40 people a year.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.373
I think you could
be one of them.

25:42.408 --> 25:43.474
Really?

25:45.344 --> 25:46.911
Not that it matters.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.547
It's too late to apply now,
anyway.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.015
Well, I know the Dean.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.416
I could make a phone call.

25:52.451 --> 25:55.286
Find out about the application
timeline for you.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.021
Would you really do that
for me?

25:57.056 --> 25:58.455
Of course.

25:58.491 --> 26:01.892
Everyone deserves to follow
their dreams.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.295
And, I would go with that one.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.129
I knew it!

26:05.164 --> 26:06.297
That's the one I'm making.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.101
Hey, Ava?

26:11.137 --> 26:12.202
We should get you back
to the house.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.037
Okay.

26:13.072 --> 26:13.871
Thanks, Maddie.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.739
You're welcome.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.043
G'night.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.811
<i>Goodnight, Ava.</i>

26:22.415 --> 26:24.348
Goodnight, Carter.

26:26.385 --> 26:29.753
'Night.

26:29.789 --> 26:32.957
And the elephant is growing.

27:14.767 --> 27:15.833
Thank you.

27:18.304 --> 27:21.739
Oh, and can I get a slice
of Marva's famous pie?

27:21.774 --> 27:22.573
Thank you.

27:22.608 --> 27:24.174
Oh yum.

27:34.920 --> 27:38.689
You know it's 9:30
in the morning?

27:38.724 --> 27:40.124
What?

27:40.159 --> 27:41.825
Crust is basically bread,

27:41.861 --> 27:44.528
and pie is made
from milk and eggs,

27:44.563 --> 27:47.364
and a few other ingredients
I can't think of right now.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.298
But I think we can agree

27:48.334 --> 27:52.236
that this is a legitimate
breakfast food.

27:54.373 --> 27:57.408
You're welcome to sit with me,
if you want.

27:57.443 --> 28:01.578
I don't know if we were,
uh, speaking or not speaking.

28:01.614 --> 28:02.579
Yeah, I didn't know either,

28:02.615 --> 28:06.383
but this conversation
would suggest we are.

28:06.419 --> 28:07.985
Okay.

28:13.459 --> 28:21.331
I, um, I didn't mean
to insult you yesterday.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.132
I guess there's a lot of

28:22.168 --> 28:25.736
unresolved stuff between us,
huh?

28:25.771 --> 28:27.905
Well, let's clear the air,
Carter, once and for all.

28:27.940 --> 28:28.972
Right here, right now,

28:29.008 --> 28:34.111
so we can co-exist in
a more harmonious nature.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.546
Okay.

28:35.581 --> 28:37.481
Yeah, um.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.683
Lay it on me.

28:39.719 --> 28:42.086
Okay.

28:42.121 --> 28:46.690
You were so vague about the
reason you didn't go with me

28:46.726 --> 28:53.897
to New York, and then
complete radio silence.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.933
Yeah, I'm going to be
honest with you,

28:55.968 --> 28:58.368
I just chickened out.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.870
As it became real,

28:59.905 --> 29:04.475
the idea of suddenly moving
to New York got so big.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.677
But that's what was so exciting.

29:06.712 --> 29:08.445
Yeah, it was exciting for you.

29:08.481 --> 29:10.013
I get that, but...

29:10.049 --> 29:11.181
You had a plan.

29:11.217 --> 29:12.082
You knew what you were
gonna do.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.451
You knew how you were gonna
get there.

29:14.487 --> 29:15.986
But for me, I don't know,

29:16.021 --> 29:17.888
I didn't know how I was
gonna go from being a guy

29:17.923 --> 29:22.359
that just made nice furniture to
actually making a living at it.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.094
I don't know, maybe it's
just something as simple as

29:24.130 --> 29:26.930
I didn't see myself
moving there

29:26.966 --> 29:29.767
and you didn't see yourself
staying here.

29:29.802 --> 29:34.638
How would you know?
You never asked.

29:34.673 --> 29:35.706
No, no, no.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.808
I am not gonna be the one
to stand in your way.

29:37.843 --> 29:38.876
From the very first moment
I met you,

29:38.911 --> 29:40.978
I knew that you were destined
for greater things

29:41.013 --> 29:42.246
than this place could offer.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.947
I thought the same thing
about you, Carter,

29:43.983 --> 29:45.349
and your talent.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.585
No. Claremont was always
too small for you.

29:48.621 --> 29:49.820
I love this town.

29:49.855 --> 29:53.657
I could stay here and do what
I love working for your dad.

29:53.692 --> 29:54.892
Okay.

29:54.927 --> 29:58.061
But when is the last time you
sold one of your own pieces?

29:58.097 --> 29:59.463
I dabble a little bit.

29:59.498 --> 30:00.564
You know?

30:00.599 --> 30:03.367
Now there's no pressure.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.903
I get that.

30:05.938 --> 30:09.606
All I meant yesterday was...
you could be great, too.

30:16.549 --> 30:17.648
Excuse me.

30:17.683 --> 30:19.983
Could I get one of those also?

30:20.019 --> 30:21.919
Make mine a double.

30:21.954 --> 30:24.988
It's good you got your own,
'cause I'm not sharing.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.559
Some things never change.

30:28.594 --> 30:33.831
♪ <i>Ring, ring, ring,</i>
<i>there goes the bell...</i> ♪

30:33.866 --> 30:35.365
Thanks for coming
with me.

30:35.401 --> 30:40.671
I really didn't know
what to get Kate or Mom.

30:40.706 --> 30:45.776
Hallie, this year is going
to be different.

30:45.811 --> 30:47.911
And I really would like
for us to connect.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.780
I mean that.

30:49.815 --> 30:51.849
I'd like that too, Maddie.

30:51.884 --> 30:53.784
It's just that, with a business,
and Katie,

30:53.819 --> 30:57.020
and trying to find the time,
I...

30:57.056 --> 30:58.655
Well, I could take on more.

30:58.691 --> 30:59.690
Really.

30:59.725 --> 31:00.624
I... I... I know that mom
is a little burnt out,

31:00.659 --> 31:02.693
and that she would like
to travel, and...

31:02.728 --> 31:04.361
You taking on the dance
is plenty.

31:04.396 --> 31:05.762
I... I got the business covered.

31:05.798 --> 31:06.964
Hallie...

31:06.999 --> 31:09.199
Look, I know that this company
was supposed to be yours,

31:09.235 --> 31:11.201
and that I got it by default
after Dad retired,

31:11.237 --> 31:13.971
but I'm good at this, Maddie,
and I will find a way to take

31:14.006 --> 31:16.673
the business to the next level
so that we can hire more staff

31:16.709 --> 31:19.376
and Mom can retire in style.

31:19.411 --> 31:20.544
I'm sure you will.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.212
But I could brainstorm with you.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.146
With my brand-

31:23.182 --> 31:24.514
I got this, Maddie.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.450
Okay?

31:28.988 --> 31:29.820
<i>Hey girls.</i>

31:29.855 --> 31:30.921
Hey, honey.

31:30.956 --> 31:31.788

31:31.824 --> 31:33.156
That's a wrap on
Christmas shopping.

31:33.192 --> 31:34.258
Oh, what'd you get me?

31:34.293 --> 31:36.059
You have to wait until Christmas
morning to find out.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.828
Not a problem.
I totally will.

31:37.863 --> 31:39.730
Hey! Absolutely not.

31:39.765 --> 31:40.831
I would never.

31:40.866 --> 31:43.333
I'm just making sure that it was
heavy enough for me.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.238

31:54.613 --> 31:55.879
Oh, Ava.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.547
I talked to my friend
at the fashion institute,

31:57.583 --> 31:59.049
and you have
until January 1st,

31:59.084 --> 32:01.018
but you have to get your
application in right away

32:01.053 --> 32:03.253
because they're shutting
down for Christmas.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.055
And, I might have put a good
word in for you,

32:05.090 --> 32:07.324
so use my name
if you do apply.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.126
Thank you so much.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.460
I think I'm gonna do it.

32:10.496 --> 32:11.728
Okay, but you have to tell
your mom.

32:11.764 --> 32:14.831
Oh, I probably won't get in, so
there's not much to tell yet.

32:14.867 --> 32:17.167
Oh, Ava, you have to have
faith in yourself.

32:17.202 --> 32:18.936
And when it comes
to fashion, trust me.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.671
You have the "it factor."

32:20.706 --> 32:21.805
Thanks, Maddie.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.106
I finished my dress last night.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.374
Can I show you?

32:24.410 --> 32:26.677
I think I want to send in some
pictures with my application.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.445
Yeah. Show it to me.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.047
For your eyes only.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.815
Okay!

32:33.953 --> 32:35.052
It's perfect.

32:44.830 --> 32:45.562
Carter.

32:45.597 --> 32:46.330
Yeah?

32:46.365 --> 32:47.531
I'll be right back.

32:47.566 --> 32:48.665
Where you goin'?

32:48.701 --> 32:50.033
Oh, I'm going to the Christmas
tree lot to get a tree

32:50.069 --> 32:51.368
for the barn.

32:51.403 --> 32:52.703
I know you haven't lived here
in a long time,

32:52.738 --> 32:54.871
but have you forgotten
every tradition?

32:54.907 --> 32:55.706
No.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.307
But in an effort to save time...

32:57.343 --> 33:00.410
In Claremont, we always
cut down our own tree.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.379
Come on, you should
remember this.

33:02.414 --> 33:05.582
I'll grab a saw, and then
we'll go get one.

33:10.089 --> 33:12.489
She doesn't want anyone to see
the dress until the dance.

33:12.524 --> 33:13.557
It's her big reveal.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.092
Ah, yes, I've heard
about this dress and I know

33:15.127 --> 33:17.794
that she's very excited
about her date with Robbie,

33:17.830 --> 33:19.796
which Nat is not
super thrilled about,

33:19.832 --> 33:23.367
but she is happy that I'm going
to be there to supervise Ava.

33:23.402 --> 33:24.368
Oh, come on.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.003
Everyone takes a date
to this dance.

33:26.038 --> 33:27.337
It's part of the tradition.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.372
Yeah, I know.

33:28.407 --> 33:29.506
Not chaperones, though.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.142
No, of course not.
It's for the kids.

33:32.177 --> 33:35.145
Yeah. Not that I would have
anybody to go with anyway.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.848
Really.

33:37.883 --> 33:39.116
Why are you so surprised?

33:39.151 --> 33:43.353
Because I saw you with somebody
downtown when we were shopping,

33:43.389 --> 33:45.255
and then at your house
last night.

33:45.290 --> 33:48.959
Wait, you were at my house
last night?

33:50.929 --> 33:52.062
No.

33:53.899 --> 33:56.033
Okay, yes.

33:56.068 --> 33:59.636
I just came by to talk about
the stuff that went on

33:59.671 --> 34:00.604
between us and I...

34:00.639 --> 34:02.639
but I saw that you were busy
with somebody,

34:02.674 --> 34:05.108
and I... I didn't want
to interrupt.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.877
So you were checking up
on me.

34:06.912 --> 34:07.811
No.

34:07.846 --> 34:08.678
I was not.

34:08.714 --> 34:09.579
Cause I've been checked up
on before,

34:09.614 --> 34:12.149
and this... this kinda looks
like that.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.516
Well, you're wrong.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.284
I simply went over to talk
to a friend,

34:15.320 --> 34:17.353
and the very last thing
I was doing in that moment

34:17.389 --> 34:18.755
was checking up.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.322
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

34:20.359 --> 34:21.257
My mistake.

34:21.293 --> 34:24.226
You were not checking up on me.

34:24.263 --> 34:27.531
While you were checking up
on me.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.232
Oh, for goodness sake.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.467
Oh, that was Evelyn,
by the way.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.770
My cousin.

34:35.007 --> 34:36.072
Look at that.

34:36.108 --> 34:36.773
That is beautiful.

34:36.809 --> 34:38.275
That is our tree right there.

34:38.310 --> 34:43.447
It is big, it is dominating,
it's... green.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.649
That sounds like you're
describing The Incredible Hulk,

34:45.684 --> 34:48.217
not a Christmas tree.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.920
Okay, well how would you
describe it?

34:50.956 --> 34:55.092
Festive, magical, nostalgic.

34:55.127 --> 34:59.096
I mean, okay, if you want
to be so on the nose about it.

34:59.131 --> 35:00.063
Okay.

35:00.099 --> 35:01.298
Let's cut this baby down.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.232
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.101
When's the last time
you cut down a tree?

35:04.136 --> 35:06.436
Um, 1980-never.

35:06.472 --> 35:07.337
Okay.

35:07.372 --> 35:08.271
But don't forget.

35:08.307 --> 35:09.139
I can do anything...

35:09.174 --> 35:10.941
Anything that you set
your mind to.

35:10.976 --> 35:11.908
Yes.

35:11.944 --> 35:13.210
Exactly.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.144
Oh.

35:14.179 --> 35:14.911
Step aside.

35:14.947 --> 35:16.913
Wouldn't want you
to get hurt.

35:16.949 --> 35:17.781
Woah.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.683
By all means, take the lead.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.985
Cause that worked out well
last time.

35:23.989 --> 35:26.857
♪

35:26.892 --> 35:28.959
Jenny Pickard started
the Christmas cookie swap

35:28.994 --> 35:30.327
about five years ago.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.162
It just keeps growing.

35:32.197 --> 35:33.029
It's a pretty big deal,

35:33.065 --> 35:35.232
so I do appreciate
your help tonight.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.634
So, you just bake cookies
and swap recipes?

35:37.669 --> 35:38.535
Oh no, no, no, no.

35:38.570 --> 35:39.769
It is more than that.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.305
We vote on which is the best
cookie at the end of the night,

35:42.341 --> 35:47.010
and these are our best recipes,
so it gets kind of competitive.

35:47.045 --> 35:50.714
Last year, 30 different
types of cookies.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.649
30?

35:52.684 --> 35:54.584
Wow. This is serious.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.652
Yeah.

35:55.687 --> 35:56.353
Hey, Peg.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.420
I got, uh, Hallie on the phone.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.489
She says yours keeps
going straight to voicemail?

35:59.525 --> 36:02.058
Oh, I think I left it upstairs.

36:02.094 --> 36:04.761
Carter, I am so sorry we're
keeping you late tonight.

36:04.796 --> 36:05.829
Ah, don't worry about it.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.797
I had to stay here and finish
those rush orders.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.499
So it's all good.

36:09.535 --> 36:10.800
Hi, honey.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.669
Mmhmm.

36:12.704 --> 36:13.570
Wow.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.338
Uh, cutting down trees?
Baking?

36:15.374 --> 36:17.040
Do you even recognize yourself?

36:17.075 --> 36:18.542
Oh, listen, the tree was
a success,

36:18.577 --> 36:20.877
but you might want to have
the fire chief on standby.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.647
I have him on speed dial.

36:23.682 --> 36:27.150
Perfect.

36:27.186 --> 36:30.086
Billy fell playing hockey,
and Katie's already asleep,

36:30.122 --> 36:32.389
so I'm going to go over there
to watch her

36:32.424 --> 36:34.658
while Hallie takes him
to get checked out.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.458
Is he okay?

36:35.494 --> 36:36.426
Oh, yeah, yeah.

36:36.461 --> 36:39.229
Seems to be fine, he just needs
some X-rays.

36:39.264 --> 36:43.066
Carter, um, have you ever baked?

36:43.101 --> 36:44.868
Not so much. No.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.136
Never too late to learn.

36:46.171 --> 36:50.507
Now, I want you two to follow
these three recipes to a tee.

36:50.542 --> 36:51.608
One batch of each.

36:51.643 --> 36:53.210
And... Ah, ah, ah, ah!

36:53.245 --> 36:54.878
No snacking.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.213
Think you can handle it?

36:56.248 --> 36:57.214
No.

36:57.249 --> 36:58.081
No.

36:58.116 --> 37:00.016
Perfect. I'll be back
in a few hours,

37:00.052 --> 37:04.221
and, um, no pressure,
but I wanna win.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.389
Um.

37:08.193 --> 37:09.859
All right.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.261
Okay.

37:11.296 --> 37:12.495
Let's bake.

37:12.531 --> 37:13.763
She wants to win.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.565
Yeah, I noticed that.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.667
There'd better be some
prize money involved.

37:17.703 --> 37:19.669
Hmm.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.605
Oh dear.

37:27.279 --> 37:28.245
Ooh.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.216
Ta-Dah!

37:33.252 --> 37:33.783
<i>Wow.</i>

37:33.819 --> 37:36.686
<i>Those are, uh, bad.</i>

37:36.722 --> 37:37.487
Yeah.

37:40.259 --> 37:41.958
Oh, no.

37:41.994 --> 37:44.995
<i>They look like a five-year-old
made them, don't they?</i>

37:45.030 --> 37:46.496
Uh, no, every five-year-old
I know

37:46.531 --> 37:48.198
could do much better
than that.

37:48.233 --> 37:50.333
Thanks.

37:50.369 --> 37:51.401
All right, what do you say?

37:51.436 --> 37:52.636
Do we dare taste them?

37:52.671 --> 37:53.637
Uh, yeah.

37:53.672 --> 37:56.806
I'm a... I'm a little scared,
so you first.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.174
Oh, thank you.

37:58.210 --> 38:00.277
So much for chivalry.

38:00.312 --> 38:02.412
All right. Here goes.

38:02.447 --> 38:05.081
If anything happens to me,
tell my mother I love her.

38:05.117 --> 38:06.683
Okay.

38:11.323 --> 38:12.422
How do you feel, huh?

38:12.457 --> 38:14.991
A little lightheaded?
Maybe dizzy?

38:15.027 --> 38:16.993
Nauseous?

38:17.029 --> 38:18.928
Did we put sugar in these?

38:18.964 --> 38:19.896
Yeah, of course we did.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.165
From that jar right there.

38:26.338 --> 38:27.837
That is salt.

38:27.873 --> 38:31.841
Okay, well that explains
a lot.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.810
Uh, we are two capable,
talented adults.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.579
Why can we not make
a decent batch of cookies?

38:36.615 --> 38:38.148
Well, I think it's safe to say
that baking

38:38.183 --> 38:40.717
is not in our future.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.820
Maybe we just need to find what
we do best and stick to that.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.790
No, you didn't do that.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.326
Right, I mean, you built
this successful company,

38:49.361 --> 38:52.162
and then you sold it, right?

38:54.766 --> 38:58.501
It's funny. I was on this path
to a specific destination,

38:58.537 --> 39:02.639
and I worked years to get there.

39:02.674 --> 39:07.677
Once I was there,
it felt like... what now?

39:07.713 --> 39:09.646
I think what I'm discovering
is I don't really know

39:09.681 --> 39:12.015
who I am without my job.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.850
Well, you are Maddie Finley.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.519
You're the most determined,
capable,

39:16.555 --> 39:18.755
and successful person
that I know.

39:18.790 --> 39:19.756
That's never going
to change,

39:19.791 --> 39:22.625
no matter what it says
on your business card.

39:22.661 --> 39:24.828
Well, then tell me one thing.

39:24.863 --> 39:25.795
What's that?

39:25.831 --> 39:29.065
If I am so determined,
capable and successful,

39:29.101 --> 39:31.634
how come I cannot make
an edible batch of cookies?

39:32.838 --> 39:33.636
Oh, that is a good question.

39:33.672 --> 39:34.671
We... we are gonna do this,
okay?

39:34.706 --> 39:36.272
We are gonna do this
if it takes us all night.

39:36.308 --> 39:37.640
Or all year.

39:38.710 --> 39:39.676
No kidding.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.678
It'll be next Christmas.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.146
Put the salt away.

39:43.181 --> 39:44.681
Okay.

39:45.884 --> 39:53.723
♪ <i>Silent Night,</i>
<i>holy night</i> ♪

39:53.759 --> 40:00.597
♪ <i>All is calm,</i>
<i>and all is bright</i> ♪

40:00.632 --> 40:01.898
Ah, thank you.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.666
Well, we may not
get any votes, but...

40:03.702 --> 40:05.935
At least they won't kill anyone,
so there's that.

40:05.971 --> 40:08.338
Well, that remains
to be seen.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.544
I love Christmas lights.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.346
The way they blink
in a pattern.

40:16.381 --> 40:17.447
Hmm.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.217
You know, when
I was a kid,

40:21.253 --> 40:24.721
I used to try to guess which
coloured light would blink next.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.222
Blue!

40:26.258 --> 40:28.925
Oh, see, it's not
as easy as it looks.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.560
Oh, it is so difficult.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.932
Gosh, I haven't done this
in years.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.500
I mean, it's always been there,

40:37.536 --> 40:39.569
but I guess I just
stopped looking.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.638
Yeah, well, we all get
bogged down

40:41.673 --> 40:44.441
with life's day-to-day stuff.

40:44.476 --> 40:47.777
I think it's important that I
had this time with my family.

40:47.813 --> 40:50.814
Might be the very foundation
I've been missing.

40:50.849 --> 40:51.881
Mmm.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.716
Yeah, community's important.

40:53.752 --> 40:57.287
I mean, your family,
and mine, this town.

40:57.322 --> 41:00.356
They've all had my back.

41:00.392 --> 41:02.725
And you didn't think you'd have
that in New York?

41:02.761 --> 41:08.898
Well, I knew that you would be
there for me, and...

41:08.934 --> 41:10.133
I don't know.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.034
What about you?

41:11.069 --> 41:14.471
What about your community
in New York?

41:14.506 --> 41:17.440
Oh, well, I have a really
nice group of friends.

41:17.476 --> 41:21.144
I mean, most of my social life
does revolve around work.

41:21.179 --> 41:23.112
You know.

41:23.148 --> 41:24.080
Proximity matters
to a workaholic.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.682
Of course.

41:25.717 --> 41:28.418
What about, um,
boyfriends?

41:28.453 --> 41:31.421
Oh, uh, a few.

41:31.456 --> 41:33.423
One for almost four years.

41:33.458 --> 41:34.324
Wow.

41:34.359 --> 41:38.895
But, he wasn't the one.

41:38.930 --> 41:40.029
And you?

41:40.065 --> 41:41.831
Yeah, I've, uh, dated here
and there.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.199
A few girlfriends.

41:43.235 --> 41:45.235
Same as you.

41:45.270 --> 41:48.538
But you never got married.

41:48.573 --> 41:49.472
No.

41:49.508 --> 41:51.908
No, I came close once.

41:51.943 --> 41:55.211
What happened?

41:55.247 --> 41:57.881
Well, she wasn't the one.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.015
I don't know.

41:59.050 --> 42:02.852
I think you only get one great
love in your life and...

42:02.888 --> 42:05.989
and I probably already
used mine up.

42:08.260 --> 42:09.692
Red.

42:09.728 --> 42:10.760
Ahh!

42:10.795 --> 42:12.829
You are so good at this.

42:12.864 --> 42:13.897
How can I compete?

42:14.833 --> 42:15.565
You can't.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.399
Periwinkle.

42:16.434 --> 42:17.166
Oh.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.001
Well, there you go.

42:18.036 --> 42:18.868
It's not even on there.

42:18.904 --> 42:19.769
It's not on there.

42:29.381 --> 42:30.547
Bianca, hi.

42:30.582 --> 42:31.581
How are you?

42:31.616 --> 42:35.652
Well, I'm at work a few days
before Christmas.

42:35.687 --> 42:38.821
But, I'm trying to rally, since
I like the finer things in life,

42:38.857 --> 42:41.591
like food, and a roof
over my head.

42:41.626 --> 42:43.860
<i>Other than that, I'm good.
How are you?</i>

42:43.895 --> 42:46.496
Well, I am just trying to focus
on enjoying the holidays,

42:46.531 --> 42:49.332
and planning this event. Baking.

42:49.367 --> 42:50.733
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:50.769 --> 42:52.168
You baked?

42:52.203 --> 42:53.369
Well, I guess you could
call it that

42:53.405 --> 42:55.772
after the first few batches.

42:55.807 --> 42:57.106
How are things there?

42:57.142 --> 42:59.242
Wendy Williams called here
looking for you.

42:59.277 --> 43:00.677
She's developing a shoe line,

43:00.712 --> 43:03.212
and she wants to talk about you
coming on board.

43:03.248 --> 43:04.314
Oh, right.

43:04.349 --> 43:06.215
We gave her all those shoes
for her last book tour.

43:06.251 --> 43:07.350
She's huge, Maddie.

43:07.385 --> 43:09.719
And not just for her talk show,
her clothing line, too.

43:09.754 --> 43:12.055
This could be major.

43:13.224 --> 43:15.525
Gosh, I don't... I don't know,
Bianca.

43:15.560 --> 43:18.027
I mean, it's very flattering,
but...

43:18.063 --> 43:19.762
Well, I was going to take
some time

43:19.798 --> 43:23.533
and wait for my next opportunity
to present itself.

43:23.568 --> 43:25.668
Maddie, if this isn't
opportunity knocking,

43:25.704 --> 43:26.803
then I don't know what is.

43:26.838 --> 43:28.404
Now, if the timing isn't right
for you,

43:28.440 --> 43:29.973
that's another issue.

43:30.008 --> 43:31.841
Okay, yeah, no, text me
her number

43:31.876 --> 43:34.410
and I'll see what she has
to say.

43:36.314 --> 43:37.313
Done.

43:37.349 --> 43:38.581
If you go back to work,

43:38.617 --> 43:40.483
you're going to take me
with you, right?

43:40.518 --> 43:42.151
Of course.

43:42.187 --> 43:43.486
Oh, good.

43:43.521 --> 43:45.922
Then I'll stop working
on my resume.

43:45.957 --> 43:47.023
<i>Bye.</i>

43:58.436 --> 44:01.337
Oh, the North Pole looks
perfect there.

44:01.373 --> 44:02.572
Whoo.

44:02.607 --> 44:05.875
There you go, Tony.
That's the last one, thanks.

44:06.845 --> 44:08.645
Oh. Wow.

44:08.680 --> 44:12.281
Mistletoe at a high school
dance.

44:12.317 --> 44:16.019
Well, it's just a decoration.
You know, tradition.

44:16.054 --> 44:18.287
Since when have you been
so traditional?

44:18.323 --> 44:19.856
Well, when it became my job
to give these kids

44:19.891 --> 44:22.558
a little Christmas spirit.

44:22.594 --> 44:25.194
Come on, Carter.
Don't be that way.

44:25.230 --> 44:27.063
Don't be a scrooge.

44:27.098 --> 44:28.064
I am not being a scrooge.

44:28.099 --> 44:30.633
Ah, you're being a little bit
of a scrooge.

44:30.669 --> 44:33.202
I resent that accusation.
Bah, humbug.

44:34.406 --> 44:36.205
You better be careful, or
the ghost of Christmas past

44:36.241 --> 44:38.508
will come back to set
you straight.

44:38.543 --> 44:41.611
Oh, I'm pretty sure
she's already here.

44:41.646 --> 44:42.545
Oh, really?

44:45.750 --> 44:47.950
Oh, look.

44:47.986 --> 44:50.820
Uh... that's uh.

44:54.359 --> 44:56.492
It's... just decorative.

44:57.562 --> 44:58.428
Yeah.

44:58.463 --> 44:59.228
Ceremonial.

44:59.264 --> 45:00.997
Mmhmm.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.598
Okay, all right.

45:02.634 --> 45:05.201
Um, here you go, Ebenezer,
you're in charge.

45:05.236 --> 45:07.437
I'm going to get ready
for the cookie swap.

45:07.472 --> 45:08.871
You're going?

45:08.907 --> 45:09.706
Yes.

45:09.741 --> 45:10.940
I worked so hard
on those cookies,

45:10.975 --> 45:12.909
I want to see everyone's
reaction.

45:12.944 --> 45:15.478
Uh, you did have help.

45:15.513 --> 45:16.579
Right.

45:16.614 --> 45:17.714
Carter.

45:17.749 --> 45:19.315
Would you like to come to
the cookie Christmas swap

45:19.350 --> 45:21.117
at Jenny Pickard's
house tonight?

45:21.152 --> 45:22.318
No.

45:22.353 --> 45:24.087
But I will anyway, because I
heard it gets really intense

45:24.122 --> 45:25.788
and I kind of want to be there
to see it.

45:26.591 --> 45:27.590
I'll see you tonight.

45:27.625 --> 45:29.425
Bah, Humbug.

45:38.303 --> 45:39.168
Wendy, hi.

45:39.204 --> 45:41.437
It's Maddie Finley returning
your call.

45:41.473 --> 45:42.739
Maddie!

45:42.774 --> 45:44.006
I miss you.

45:44.042 --> 45:47.243
<i>And by the way, I really do
appreciate the box of shoes</i>

45:47.278 --> 45:49.412
<i>that you sent me
for my book tour.</i>

45:49.447 --> 45:50.713
<i>But you know what?</i>

45:50.749 --> 45:52.715
I've got an idea.

45:52.751 --> 45:54.317
<i>I want to do shoes.</i>

45:54.352 --> 45:55.852
You will be great at it,
Wendy.

45:55.887 --> 45:57.453
You have incredible taste.

45:57.489 --> 46:00.656
<i>You come to New York and
help me do my shoe line.</i>

46:00.692 --> 46:03.159
You've got a stake
in the company.

46:03.194 --> 46:06.129
New York you miss,
I know you do.

46:06.164 --> 46:08.164
And you and I
will be partners.

46:08.199 --> 46:10.399
It's an exciting proposition,
but...

46:10.435 --> 46:12.635
<i>My lawyers are already
drawing up the papers.</i>

46:12.670 --> 46:15.738
You just take a look
and think about it.

46:15.774 --> 46:17.640
I'll take a look at the offer.

46:17.675 --> 46:18.608
And, Wendy, thank you.

46:18.643 --> 46:20.977
I'm really flattered
that you'd think of me.

46:21.012 --> 46:22.411
All right, girl.

46:22.447 --> 46:23.980
I hope you say yes.

46:25.216 --> 46:26.983
Merry Christmas, Wendy.

46:27.018 --> 46:28.918
Bye.

46:38.797 --> 46:41.731
Now, I've saved
my new one for last.

46:41.766 --> 46:44.834
It's a dark chocolate
fudge base,

46:44.869 --> 46:49.438
with my homemade
peppermint bark on top.

46:49.474 --> 46:51.274
<i>These cookies are amazing.</i>

46:51.309 --> 46:52.708
Ladies.

46:56.881 --> 46:57.814
Ooh...

46:57.849 --> 46:59.816
Thank you.

46:59.851 --> 47:00.683
Mmm.

47:00.718 --> 47:02.251
Oh, mmm.

47:02.287 --> 47:04.754
I might make these
for Christmas Day.

47:04.789 --> 47:05.321
Good idea.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.056
Katie loves peppermint.

47:07.091 --> 47:07.990
Sorry, Peg.

47:08.026 --> 47:09.492
Not sharing this one.

47:09.527 --> 47:14.597
Eh... isn't that the whole point
of the cookie swap, Jenny?

47:14.632 --> 47:15.565
Yeah.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.600
And you can have any
other recipe, just...

47:17.635 --> 47:19.035
not this one.

47:19.070 --> 47:20.937
I might mass-produce it.

47:20.972 --> 47:24.674
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jenny has gone rogue.

47:24.709 --> 47:25.875
It seems our next contestant,

47:25.910 --> 47:28.644
Jenny Pickard, is pulling an
ol' switcheroo on the rules.

47:28.680 --> 47:30.813
It's just a cookie.

47:30.849 --> 47:32.582
Oh, but these are special.

47:32.617 --> 47:36.519
It's rumoured that this cookie
has an 8.6 degree of difficulty,

47:36.554 --> 47:40.022
but we will never know, because
she is not sharing her recipe.

47:40.058 --> 47:43.526
Those snickerdoodles
are my mom's special recipe

47:43.561 --> 47:45.328
and I'm sharing them.

47:45.363 --> 47:46.963
Well, that's your choice, Peg.

47:46.998 --> 47:48.865
Oh, this is unprecedented
behaviour.

47:48.900 --> 47:50.566
And the crowd goes wild.

47:50.602 --> 47:52.535
And potentially disqualifying.

47:52.570 --> 47:53.236
Is this legal?

47:53.271 --> 47:54.904
Can someone check the bylaws?

47:54.939 --> 47:56.305
<i>You're not being fair,
Jenny.</i>

47:56.341 --> 47:58.274
Well, it's my house,
my rules.

47:58.309 --> 48:00.443
Ooh, it's escalating.

48:00.478 --> 48:03.212
What do you say we get outta
here before it comes to blows?

48:03.248 --> 48:05.348
We can go to the cafe
and get a peppermint pie.

48:05.383 --> 48:07.283
But it's just getting good.

48:07.318 --> 48:08.517
Come on, let's go.

48:08.553 --> 48:09.218
<i>Well, maybe you'd like
to host it next year, hmm?</i>

48:09.254 --> 48:10.887
<i>Well, perhaps I would.</i>

48:10.922 --> 48:14.357
<i>And perhaps I might edit
the guest list.</i>

48:14.392 --> 48:16.359
Well, you won't have my cookies.

48:16.394 --> 48:17.760
<i>I don't know why
you think</i>

48:17.795 --> 48:20.396
<i>your cookies are always
the best, Jenny.</i>

48:20.431 --> 48:21.497
<i>Everyone here is a good cook.</i>

48:21.532 --> 48:24.000
<i>Come on!</i>

48:24.035 --> 48:25.701
Well, you wanna walk, or drive?

48:25.737 --> 48:27.670
Oh, well let's walk.

48:27.705 --> 48:29.739
It's not that far.

48:29.774 --> 48:33.709
Do you remember when we used
to walk downtown?

48:33.745 --> 48:34.944
Yeah, it didn't matter
how cold it was,

48:34.979 --> 48:36.479
as long as the Christmas lights
were on.

48:37.448 --> 48:39.015
I used to think Claremont
was so bright

48:39.050 --> 48:41.484
you could see it
from outer space.

48:41.519 --> 48:44.086
I'm pretty sure you can do that
with New York.

48:44.122 --> 48:45.955
A different kind of bright.

48:45.990 --> 48:47.423
Yes, it is.

48:47.458 --> 48:49.492
Who wins in a duel?

48:49.527 --> 48:51.227
It's a draw.

48:51.262 --> 48:52.395
I don't know about that.

48:55.466 --> 48:57.667
I got an offer.

48:57.702 --> 48:59.201
A start-up shoe company.

48:59.237 --> 49:00.069
Oh.

49:00.104 --> 49:02.505
Talked to the woman today.

49:02.540 --> 49:04.941
It's definitely in
my wheelhouse.

49:04.976 --> 49:07.476
guess I was just hoping that
the skies would open up and,

49:07.512 --> 49:11.647
I don't know, my future
would fall into my lap.

49:13.751 --> 49:17.486
Well, maybe that's
what this is.

49:17.522 --> 49:20.056
Guess you just have to trust
your instincts.

49:20.091 --> 49:21.891
Is that what you do?

49:21.926 --> 49:23.059
Try to.

49:23.094 --> 49:26.095
So, what do your instincts
tell you about your future?

49:26.130 --> 49:27.396
I mean, what if my mom retires,

49:27.432 --> 49:29.966
or if the business
doesn't work out?

49:30.001 --> 49:31.434
What's next?

49:31.469 --> 49:32.735
Uh, I don't know.

49:32.770 --> 49:35.404
I'll have to find a plan B,
I guess.

49:35.440 --> 49:38.140
Starting a business
is hard at first,

49:38.176 --> 49:41.143
but the feeling of
accomplishment

49:41.179 --> 49:43.212
when you build something
from the ground up?

49:43.247 --> 49:46.749
There is nothing like that.

49:46.784 --> 49:47.917
You know, you should see
your face

49:47.952 --> 49:49.719
when you talk about this stuff.

49:50.688 --> 49:51.554
It lights up.

49:51.589 --> 49:54.590
Well, maybe it's
the Christmas lights.

49:54.625 --> 49:58.995
Well, maybe you weren't ready
to get rid of your business.

49:59.030 --> 49:59.895
Which would have been foolish,

49:59.931 --> 50:02.798
considering how much
they offered you.

50:02.834 --> 50:06.102
You know, that's a huge
testament to what you built.

50:06.137 --> 50:07.703
Well, my mother likes
to say that

50:07.739 --> 50:11.107
"there are no mistakes,
only decisions."

50:11.142 --> 50:13.876
I guess you'll have to figure
that out when you get home.

50:13.911 --> 50:15.111
Home tonight?

50:15.146 --> 50:19.515
No, your actual home.
New York.

50:19.550 --> 50:21.584
Oh yeah, right.

50:21.619 --> 50:23.786
Because New York
is my home.

50:35.466 --> 50:36.632
Wow, look at this.

50:36.667 --> 50:42.304
I mean, I wish we had this as
a decoration for the barn.

50:42.340 --> 50:44.407
Yeah. It'd definitely go
with our theme.

50:47.111 --> 50:48.244
You just like the lights.

50:48.279 --> 50:49.945
I do, and I want it
for the dance,

50:49.981 --> 50:53.149
but I'm sure it's out of
our decorating budget.

50:53.184 --> 50:55.351
It's not.

50:55.386 --> 50:57.787
How do you know? I don't see
a price tag.

50:57.822 --> 50:59.588
It's not for sale.

51:01.125 --> 51:02.591
I made it.

51:04.028 --> 51:06.295
This is what you've been doing
in your spare time?

51:06.330 --> 51:07.163
HmmMmm.

51:07.198 --> 51:08.297
I thought you were
making furniture.

51:08.332 --> 51:11.000
Nope, just tiny little houses.

51:11.035 --> 51:13.002
Are there any more of these?

51:13.037 --> 51:15.037
Of various designs.

51:15.073 --> 51:19.542
Carter, why... why don't you put
this on the website?

51:19.577 --> 51:25.648
You could do special orders,
ship all over the country.

51:25.683 --> 51:28.851
Hey, Carter Allen, stop!
I have more questions.

51:28.886 --> 51:30.653
Yeah, course you do.

51:30.688 --> 51:31.921
You have a gift.

51:31.956 --> 51:32.922
That's not a question.

51:32.957 --> 51:34.457
Uh, okay, let me rephrase that.

51:34.492 --> 51:36.625
Why are you letting this gift
go to waste?

51:36.661 --> 51:38.461
Listen, Maddie.
That is a hobby.

51:38.496 --> 51:40.696
A hobby is something you do
because you love it.

51:40.731 --> 51:41.931
I've already got a job

51:41.966 --> 51:44.366
where I get to utilize these
same skills every single day.

51:44.402 --> 51:46.502
It's the best of both worlds.

51:46.537 --> 51:47.670
Carter.

51:47.705 --> 51:51.907
That back there, people would
pay good money for that.

51:51.943 --> 51:53.375
Come on, people aren't going
to buy

51:53.411 --> 51:55.044
that stuff on a regular basis.

51:55.079 --> 51:55.778
But Ca-

51:55.813 --> 51:56.846
Maddie, come on.
Just let it go.

51:56.881 --> 51:57.947
Carter-

51:58.883 --> 52:01.450
I appreciate it,
but let it go.

52:01.486 --> 52:04.120
Come on, cafe closes
in an hour.

52:12.130 --> 52:12.928
Okay, girls.

52:12.964 --> 52:14.864
The punch bowls can go
right there.

52:14.899 --> 52:16.799
Thank you.

52:19.937 --> 52:21.604
I still haven't heard anything.

52:21.639 --> 52:24.640
Well, Ava, you just submitted
the application two days ago.

52:24.675 --> 52:25.975
And, it's the holidays.

52:26.010 --> 52:28.677
You said she was going to look
at it right away.

52:28.713 --> 52:30.646
She probably did,
and she hated them.

52:30.681 --> 52:32.381
That's it. She hates me.

52:32.416 --> 52:34.216
Ava, she doesn't hate you.

52:34.252 --> 52:35.985
You have to believe in yourself.

52:36.020 --> 52:39.255
I do, but will
everyone else?

52:39.290 --> 52:42.258
Yes. I guarantee it.

52:45.930 --> 52:47.129
Found one reindeer.

52:47.165 --> 52:48.531
Oh, great.

52:48.566 --> 52:50.599
Thank you for coming by
and lending a hand.

52:51.903 --> 52:53.502
Yeah, well it looked like you
guys were short one left hand.

52:54.772 --> 52:57.106
Hallie thinks I'm just trying
to get out of doing dishes.

52:57.141 --> 52:58.941
Oh, I could think
of worse plans.

52:59.744 --> 53:00.843
I'm gonna go find
his buddies.

53:00.878 --> 53:02.378
All right, good luck.

53:02.413 --> 53:04.079
What's going on here?

53:04.115 --> 53:07.716
Oh, a little, uh, decoration
for the refreshment area.

53:07.752 --> 53:09.818
Hmm.

53:09.854 --> 53:11.187
Got that.

53:11.222 --> 53:12.655
You have more?

53:12.690 --> 53:14.523
I know it doesn't look much
like Santa's village right now,

53:14.559 --> 53:15.524
but don't worry.

53:15.560 --> 53:16.425
I will adjust.

53:16.460 --> 53:17.960
I have props.

53:17.995 --> 53:21.797
Carter. It's perfect.

53:21.832 --> 53:23.666
You wanna know why I do this?

53:23.701 --> 53:26.168
Because of the look
on people's faces.

53:26.204 --> 53:27.636
Just like yours.

53:27.672 --> 53:29.672
Come on, help me
put it together.

53:33.744 --> 53:36.612
Hey. This looks like
your parents' house.

53:36.647 --> 53:38.581
Oh, that's because it is.

53:38.616 --> 53:40.282
This, uh, set was
originally intended

53:40.318 --> 53:42.851
to be a replica of Claremont.

53:42.887 --> 53:45.154
But don't let, uh, Mrs. Claus
fool you.

53:45.189 --> 53:47.256
The coffeehouse where you get
your morning latte

53:47.291 --> 53:50.259
is now Santa's office.

53:52.230 --> 53:54.196
You really love it here
in Claremont.

53:54.232 --> 53:56.465
Yeah, I sure do.

53:56.500 --> 53:58.567
This is home.

54:04.442 --> 54:06.242
Here you go, Mom.

54:06.277 --> 54:07.543
Thanks, honey.

54:07.578 --> 54:09.945
The princess paper
is for Katie's gifts.

54:09.981 --> 54:12.047
Yeah, I kind of figured
it wasn't for Billy.

54:12.083 --> 54:14.250
Well, I'm glad I finished
wrapping yours already.

54:14.285 --> 54:16.885
Mom, I told you not to spend
your money on me.

54:16.921 --> 54:17.753
It's not the money.

54:17.788 --> 54:19.355
It's the joy of giving.

54:19.390 --> 54:22.925
And I love having
all my family here.

54:22.960 --> 54:25.094
It's been a good week.

54:25.129 --> 54:28.964
Because of family,
or something else?

54:29.000 --> 54:31.367
What are you trying
to say to me, Mother?

54:31.402 --> 54:32.935
I see you and Carter.

54:32.970 --> 54:35.371
It's like you stepped right back
into that old chemistry

54:35.406 --> 54:37.973
without missing a beat.

54:38.009 --> 54:41.577
I don't know. Maybe my clarity
is this new job.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.479
Carter loves it here.

54:43.514 --> 54:47.149
He doesn't want to leave,
and I can't stay.

54:47.184 --> 54:49.251
Why not?

54:49.287 --> 54:52.354
Everyone here has a purpose
but me.

54:52.390 --> 54:54.023
I don't even know
what I would do.

54:54.058 --> 54:57.726
Purpose comes in all different
shapes and sizes, Maddie.

54:57.762 --> 54:58.827
Why is it, do you think,

54:58.863 --> 55:01.597
that neither you nor Carter
have ever settled down?

55:01.632 --> 55:03.966
That no one was ever
good enough for you?

55:04.001 --> 55:06.135
That has nothing to do
with Carter and me.

55:06.170 --> 55:09.438
Maybe it's because the two
of you were meant to be.

55:09.473 --> 55:12.941
Maybe what's been missing
from your life all this time...

55:12.977 --> 55:14.943
is Carter.

55:14.979 --> 55:16.945
Think about it.

55:27.024 --> 55:28.624
What's that?

55:28.659 --> 55:29.692
Ahh!

55:32.396 --> 55:35.731
Is this a private party,
or can anyone join in?

55:35.766 --> 55:37.599
Uh-huh, it's public property.

55:37.635 --> 55:39.902
Uh, no, actually, it's not.

55:39.937 --> 55:42.171
It's my mom's house.

55:42.206 --> 55:45.040
And we still have a lot of work
to do in the barn.

55:45.076 --> 55:49.178
We don't have time for
your silly little games.

55:49.213 --> 55:52.281
Who's being a scrooge now, huh?

55:52.316 --> 55:53.816
Still you.

55:53.851 --> 55:54.817
Oh!

55:54.852 --> 55:56.752
I cannot believe you fell
for that.

55:56.787 --> 55:59.221
That is the oldest trick
in the book.

55:59.256 --> 56:01.123
Oh, it's on now.

56:01.158 --> 56:02.291
Carter, no!

56:02.326 --> 56:03.559
No, no, no, no!

56:03.594 --> 56:05.361
Oh, no, no, no, I'm dead.

56:06.063 --> 56:07.696
Carter!

56:11.469 --> 56:12.534
<i>Oh.</i>

56:13.504 --> 56:16.238
Mom? You're back.

56:16.273 --> 56:19.441
Yeah, my last flight
was cancelled.

56:19.477 --> 56:21.877
What is this, Ava?

56:23.681 --> 56:24.780
I got in!

56:24.815 --> 56:27.282
Maddie, you did it!

56:27.318 --> 56:28.650
Oh, well no, Ava, you did it.

56:28.686 --> 56:30.619
They... they only accept
the best of the best,

56:30.654 --> 56:32.087
and that's you!

56:32.123 --> 56:34.089
I can't believe you went behind
our backs

56:34.125 --> 56:35.557
and helped her with this.

56:35.593 --> 56:36.692
This isn't Maddie's fault.

56:36.727 --> 56:38.694
I was supposed to talk to you
about it, and I didn't.

56:38.729 --> 56:40.896
She has a real gift, Natalie.

56:40.931 --> 56:43.198
Well, getting in is one thing.

56:43.234 --> 56:47.536
But, making a living at it is
an entirely different scenario.

56:47.571 --> 56:49.071
We have a plan for her future.

56:49.106 --> 56:50.005
A good plan.

56:50.040 --> 56:52.107
No, you had a plan.

56:52.143 --> 56:53.375
It's not what I wanted.

56:53.411 --> 56:54.343
Nat.

56:54.378 --> 56:56.345
She did get in, despite
the big competition.

56:56.380 --> 56:57.479
Right?

56:57.515 --> 56:59.047
And if anybody can help
her navigate this experience,

56:59.083 --> 56:59.915
it's Maddie.

56:59.950 --> 57:00.983
Carter, please.

57:01.018 --> 57:02.017
<i>It's my dream.</i>

57:02.052 --> 57:04.586
And we're supposed to follow
our dreams, right?

57:04.622 --> 57:07.723
Isn't that what you taught me,
practically from birth?

57:07.758 --> 57:10.325
Well... I'm happy to tell her
everything I know

57:10.361 --> 57:11.693
about the city,
the institute,

57:11.729 --> 57:14.329
the art of networking
to get a job.

57:14.365 --> 57:15.964
She'd have a friend in New York.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.399
It doesn't matter.

57:17.435 --> 57:18.133
She's not going.

57:18.169 --> 57:21.603
It's... it's too risky.

57:22.773 --> 57:24.640
Come on, Ava.

57:29.880 --> 57:31.814
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to overstep.

57:31.849 --> 57:32.981
No, no.

57:33.017 --> 57:34.183
You always want the best
for people,

57:34.218 --> 57:35.651
and that's... that's good.

57:35.686 --> 57:37.820
There's no shame in that.

57:42.560 --> 57:43.459
All right.

57:43.494 --> 57:45.894
Time to get the little one
home and fed,

57:45.930 --> 57:47.362
all with one arm, I might add.

57:48.499 --> 57:49.731
Okay. I'm going to stay here
and finish this for Mom,

57:49.767 --> 57:50.966
and I will be home later.

57:51.001 --> 57:52.501
She's lucky to have you.

57:52.536 --> 57:53.702
We all are.

57:53.737 --> 57:54.269
Mmhmm.

57:54.305 --> 57:55.237
I love you.

57:55.272 --> 57:56.171
Love you.

57:56.207 --> 57:58.073
And I love you.

57:58.108 --> 57:59.241
I'll be home real soon, okay?

57:59.276 --> 58:00.442
'Kay.

58:00.478 --> 58:02.411
One for the road.
One for the road.

58:02.446 --> 58:03.846
One, one.

58:03.881 --> 58:04.546
Let's go, kiddo.

58:04.582 --> 58:06.048
Mmhmm.

58:06.083 --> 58:08.217
Hey, Billy! Hey, Katie girl!

58:08.252 --> 58:09.585
You're working late today.

58:09.620 --> 58:10.586
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out

58:10.621 --> 58:12.488
this new structural plan
for Mom.

58:12.523 --> 58:13.622
She's convinced if she retires,

58:13.657 --> 58:15.157
she's going to leave us
in the lurch,

58:15.192 --> 58:20.062
so I am trying to find a way
to make us lurch-free.

58:20.097 --> 58:21.497
You have a really
beautiful family,

58:21.532 --> 58:23.232
you know that?

58:23.267 --> 58:24.032
Thanks.

58:24.068 --> 58:25.667
I had great role models.

58:25.703 --> 58:28.070
Yes, you did.

58:28.105 --> 58:30.372
It's nice to have someone
to share the trials

58:30.407 --> 58:34.443
and tribulations of life with,
isn't it?

58:34.478 --> 58:37.713
Do you have anyone in New York,
Maddie?

58:37.748 --> 58:39.047
I do.

58:39.083 --> 58:42.217
I... I have a lot of good friends,
and fantastic ex-employees.

58:42.253 --> 58:45.187
I have a lot of "anyones"
in New York,

58:45.222 --> 58:49.958
but not that one "anyone" yet.

58:49.994 --> 58:51.894
I didn't realize that
was something you wanted.

58:51.929 --> 58:55.264
You're so independent and
put together all the time.

58:55.299 --> 58:59.401
I guess my convenient
facade worked.

58:59.436 --> 59:01.069
I just... if I could zip
in and out at Christmas,

59:01.105 --> 59:04.606
I wouldn't have to face
everything I was missing.

59:04.642 --> 59:06.275
But, after spending time
with all of you,

59:06.310 --> 59:10.112
and the lights, and the smell
of cedar at the wood shop,

59:10.147 --> 59:13.415
and oh, the drama over the
peppermint bar cookie recipe.

59:15.519 --> 59:18.053
I realized I've missed a lot.

59:18.088 --> 59:20.355
And Carter?

59:20.391 --> 59:23.125
I have a thought about Carter...
For business.

59:23.160 --> 59:25.193
Now, I know you don't want
my advice.

59:25.229 --> 59:27.729
But his woodwork is exceptional.

59:27.765 --> 59:28.830
I know.

59:28.866 --> 59:30.699
He made this little dollhouse
ornament for Katie,

59:30.734 --> 59:33.702
and it is just the cutest thing
I have ever seen.

59:33.737 --> 59:36.705
Someone could fabricate
Dad's furniture designs,

59:36.740 --> 59:39.141
which would free up Carter
to do what he really loves.

59:39.176 --> 59:41.243
Now, again, not trying to tell
you what to do

59:41.278 --> 59:43.245
with the business, because
I know you've got it.

59:43.280 --> 59:45.681
No, I know.

59:45.716 --> 59:47.583
It's a good idea, Maddie.

59:47.618 --> 59:50.419
Actually, it... it might be
just the thing.

59:50.454 --> 59:53.755
We could expand without
changing our overhead.

59:53.791 --> 59:56.892
You know, maybe what you
should do is put some pictures

59:56.927 --> 59:59.928
of his work up on the website
and send out an email blast.

59:59.964 --> 01:00:01.363
Just to test the waters.

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:03.298
I don't know if Carter
would be okay with that.

01:00:03.334 --> 01:00:04.533
Oh, I think he would be.

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:06.535
Especially when he saw
the response.

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:09.104
I know it's gonna be positive.

01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:10.038
All right.

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:11.106
I'll give it a go.

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:12.207
Good.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:15.777
You know that Mom made me
sneak one of

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:20.048
Jenny Pickard's peppermint bark
cookies in my purse?

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:20.983
What?

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:22.884
Why?

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.520
She's going to try and replicate
it by taste.

01:00:26.557 --> 01:00:27.422
Really?

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:28.924
And then what's she gonna
do with it?

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:29.858
She has no idea.

01:00:29.893 --> 01:00:31.526
But she's gonna show
that Jenny Pickard.

01:00:31.562 --> 01:00:33.295
Well, Jenny should know better
than to try to hide

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.497
a cookie recipe from Peg Finley.

01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:41.903
I mean, they tasted like mint
and cardboard anyway.

01:00:41.939 --> 01:00:43.138
You're a cookie spy.

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:47.242
What is going on here?

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:48.176
Oh, nothing.

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:49.745
We're just reminiscing.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.980
Would you like a cookie, Mom?

01:00:52.016 --> 01:00:53.348
You cookie spy?

01:00:53.384 --> 01:00:54.316
Who made these?

01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:55.183
Jenny Pickard.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.552
Never crossing my lips.

01:00:57.588 --> 01:01:00.022
No, no, no, no, no.

01:01:06.096 --> 01:01:08.463
This colour should be perfect.

01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:10.399
Thank you for helping me
get ready.

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:12.000
My mom's not back
until tomorrow,

01:01:12.036 --> 01:01:15.103
and things have been weird
between us anyway.

01:01:15.139 --> 01:01:17.172
That's just because
she loves you, Ava.

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:19.708
And who knows, maybe
she'll change her mind.

01:01:19.743 --> 01:01:23.445
But in the meantime,
tonight is your night.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.447
Hey, are you girls ready...

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:29.317
Ava, you look beautiful.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:30.819
You really do.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:31.620
But are you ready yet?

01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:33.388
'Cause it's been, like,
37 hours.

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:34.489
Carter.

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:36.558
We've been here an hour
and these things take time.

01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:37.559
Okay, I get it.

01:01:37.594 --> 01:01:39.494
But Robbie's downstairs,
he's a little fidgety,

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:41.997
and he might have a coronary if
you don't get down there soon.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:42.864
I'm just saying.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.600
Okay, we'll be down
in five minutes.

01:01:45.636 --> 01:01:46.768
He's here.

01:01:46.804 --> 01:01:47.969
You look stunning.

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:50.005
I have one more thing for you.

01:01:57.448 --> 01:01:59.247
They're so beautiful.

01:01:59.283 --> 01:02:01.383
Well, a girl should
have the perfect shoe

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:04.252
for the perfect night.

01:02:04.288 --> 01:02:05.821
You're so lucky.

01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:08.023
You got to live your dream.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.525
Well, that's the funny thing
about dreams, Ava.

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:13.962
If you believe in them,
they come true.

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:16.965
Now, put these on, and
go make your entrance.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.301
I'll meet you downstairs.

01:02:24.374 --> 01:02:25.741
How are Angie and Keith?

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:26.808
Yeah, they're good.

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:27.609
Good. Yeah.

01:02:27.644 --> 01:02:28.643
<i>Tell 'em I said hi.</i>

01:02:28.679 --> 01:02:29.778
<i>For sure.</i>

01:02:31.115 --> 01:02:32.147
<i>Wow.</i>

01:02:36.787 --> 01:02:37.953
You look...

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:39.054
Thanks.

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.155
So do you.

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.022
Thanks.

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:42.124
Uh, I brought this for you.

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:42.858
Oh, thank you.

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:45.127
I have something for you
as well.

01:02:45.162 --> 01:02:46.661
Cool tree.

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:54.202
Wow.

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:56.905
You clean up nice.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.006
Oh, this old thing?

01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:00.776
Nah. It's been collecting
dust in my closet since,

01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:03.211
well, since our dance, probably.

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:06.248
Ahem.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:08.016
We're going to go
out back now.

01:03:08.051 --> 01:03:09.017
Okay.

01:03:09.052 --> 01:03:09.951
Robbie.

01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:11.319
Want you to have her home
by 11:00, okay?

01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:12.020
Yeah.

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:13.221
12:00.

01:03:13.257 --> 01:03:14.356
11:30.

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:15.290
12:30.

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:18.260
What? You don't negotiate up.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.361
Come on.

01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:20.162
I told your mother I'd have
you home by midnight.

01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:22.063
Well then, why'd you start
so low?

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:23.932
Because I need a little
wiggle room.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.801
That's how negotiations work,
right?

01:03:25.836 --> 01:03:29.104
Sir, I'll have her back
at her house by...

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:30.639
sorry, what time?

01:03:30.674 --> 01:03:31.606
Midnight.

01:03:31.642 --> 01:03:33.208
Maybe a couple minutes before.

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:34.709
We're going to be
right next door.

01:03:34.745 --> 01:03:35.610
Oh, I know.

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.112
I'll be watching you.

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:45.587
And you.

01:03:45.622 --> 01:03:46.888
I'm going to definitely
make sure

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:48.023
we have that dance
this evening.

01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:49.958
Oh.

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:51.960
I would like that.

Including you.

01:04:31.068 --> 01:04:34.302
Yes, it turned out better
than I anticipated.

01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:36.071
Ah, it's all for the kids.

01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:37.339
Oh.

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:40.475
Hallie told me your idea about
Carter's woodworking, I like it.

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:44.813
But I am not so sure how
he's gonna feel about it.

01:04:44.848 --> 01:04:46.982
I'll take the heat
if he gets upset.

01:04:47.017 --> 01:04:48.650
And besides, sometimes
people riding the line

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:50.986
need a little push, right?

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:52.020
Exactly.

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:56.024
I'll let you get back
to your hostess duties.

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:56.892
Hello.

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:59.461
Can I have everyone's attention,
please?

01:04:59.496 --> 01:05:01.763
Hi. I am Principal Kirkland,

01:05:01.798 --> 01:05:07.002
and welcome to Claremont Park
High's annual Christmas Formal.

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:11.640
Ha ha.

01:05:11.675 --> 01:05:12.507
Yes!

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:13.475
Now.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:14.643
One of the things I love
about this community

01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:17.946
is the fact that around here,
we take care of our own.

01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:21.316
When the sprinklers went off,
we thought we'd have to cancel.

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:24.286
But Peg Finley,

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:25.854
Carter Allen,

01:05:25.889 --> 01:05:28.356
and their families really
came through for us,

01:05:28.392 --> 01:05:32.794
and I want to thank them for
making tonight so special.

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:43.071
<i>But, on to more
important matters.</i>

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:47.409
It is time to present our Winter
Court King and Queen.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.212
Drum roll please.

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:55.650
Ha ha, thank you.

01:05:55.686 --> 01:06:00.221
Please welcome your Queen,
Ava Allen.

01:06:02.926 --> 01:06:04.059
Yes!

01:06:04.094 --> 01:06:07.095
And your King, Robbie DeMers.

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:13.201
Thank you, sir.

01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:15.537
Ah, here we go.

01:06:17.908 --> 01:06:18.940
Ahh...

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:19.908
Remember when that was us?

01:06:19.943 --> 01:06:21.810
Mmm. Like it was yesterday.

01:06:21.845 --> 01:06:23.678
Well, a thousand yesterdays.

01:06:23.714 --> 01:06:25.046
But who's counting?

01:06:26.183 --> 01:06:28.483
Seems like it.

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:30.652
You know, even though
we never did get to dance,

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:34.556
it was still one of
the greatest nights.

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:37.025
Yes, it was.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.994
And now, without further ado,

01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:41.096
the Winter Court King and Queen
will share a dance.

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:46.101
Everyone, please, join in,
and Merry Christmas.

01:06:46.136 --> 01:06:47.268
Merry Christmas.

01:06:47.304 --> 01:06:49.671
Merry Christmas.

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:52.407
Ho, ho, ho!

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:56.144
I do believe that I have
promised you a dance?

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:57.412
May I?

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:04.919

Special dance moves.

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:13.261
Speaking of.

01:07:13.296 --> 01:07:15.397
Do you think they're dancing
too close together?

01:07:15.432 --> 01:07:16.731
'Cause I promised
her mother that..

01:07:16.767 --> 01:07:20.368
Psst, psst.

01:07:20.404 --> 01:07:22.137
I think that Ava is a smart
young woman

01:07:22.172 --> 01:07:23.972
with a good head
on her shoulders.

01:07:24.007 --> 01:07:25.073
Yeah.

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:27.275
And I think it's time for you
to relinquish control.

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:29.778
Is that what you're doing,
hmm?

01:07:29.813 --> 01:07:32.614
Are you, uh, relinquishing
control?

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:33.915
I'm trying.

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:34.849
'Kay.

01:07:34.885 --> 01:07:36.618
That shoe company wants
an answer from me

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:39.087
right after Christmas.

01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:40.422
Yeah.

01:07:40.457 --> 01:07:41.589
Okay, so.

01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:44.359
What do you think is gonna
happen in the next few days

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:50.765
that's gonna give you a little
clarity on that?

01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:53.168
But I'm just going to spend
some time with my family,

01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:56.504
and try not to think
about the what-ifs.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:57.372
I don't know.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:08:01.009
I think maybe what-ifs
aren't so bad.

01:08:01.044 --> 01:08:04.179
They can help you to figure out
what's important.

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:06.448
Oh, is that right?

01:08:06.483 --> 01:08:07.649
Yeah.

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:10.852
Like, what if I had gone
to New York with you?

01:08:10.887 --> 01:08:16.724
Or, what if you stayed here?

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.926
Or what if I kissed you
right now?

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:25.233
What? What's wrong?

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:26.901
I can't.

01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:28.837
What do you mean,
you can't?

01:08:28.872 --> 01:08:29.770
Maddie, listen to me.

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:31.272
This... this... this
last week together,

01:08:31.308 --> 01:08:33.841
it's brought everything back
for me.

01:08:33.877 --> 01:08:36.478
And... and I know you feel
it too.

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:38.011
What's the point?

01:08:38.048 --> 01:08:39.781
You live here, I live there.

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:40.982
We can figure that out.

01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:42.417
I don't know how.

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:44.953
But what I do know is I cannot
go through another good-bye

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:46.488
with you, Carter.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:48.156
I just can't do it.

01:08:48.191 --> 01:08:49.724
Maddie, listen.

Carter, I just want
to thank you again.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.572
You've really outdone yourself.

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:07.274
I mean, the decorations,
the themes.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:09.176
This Santa Village
set you made?

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:11.145
I'm gonna order one
for my grandson.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.647
Yeah, they're...
they're not for sale.

01:09:12.682 --> 01:09:14.983
It's, uh, just something
I do on the side.

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:18.086
That's not what
the website said.

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:19.254
The website?

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:20.488
What website?

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:22.122
Your company website.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:24.692
I got an email today
saying you were expanding

01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:25.960
into other forms of woodworking.

01:09:25.996 --> 01:09:30.932
Your own personal
hand-carved crafts?

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.167
Excuse me for a second.

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:33.001
Uh, absolutely.

01:09:33.036 --> 01:09:35.170
Hey, Merry Christmas.

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:55.356
Can I join you?

01:09:55.392 --> 01:09:59.494
I'm afraid I won't be very good
company right now.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:11.206
Did you know that when your
father first proposed to me,

01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:13.975
I said no?

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:15.877
What?

01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:17.378
How did I not know that?

01:10:17.414 --> 01:10:19.881
I didn't like to bring it up
around him.

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:23.284
He hated that I could have
potentially ruined everything.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.320
But why would you say no?

01:10:25.355 --> 01:10:28.890
I've never seen two people
more in love than you and Dad.

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:30.558
I was young.

01:10:30.594 --> 01:10:33.061
I was scared.

01:10:33.096 --> 01:10:37.832
More you have in life,
the more you have to lose.

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:38.833
But as I thought about it,

01:10:38.868 --> 01:10:42.670
I realized that love like that
can fill you up

01:10:42.706 --> 01:10:47.242
for a lifetime, no matter
how long it lasts.

01:10:47.277 --> 01:10:49.978
And even if that was all I was
ever going to get in life,

01:10:50.013 --> 01:10:56.284
I'd take it, thank
you very much.

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:02.624
You were right, Mom.

01:11:02.659 --> 01:11:05.226
It's Carter.

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:10.031
It's always been Carter.

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:14.102
You should listen to your mother
more often.

01:11:14.137 --> 01:11:16.671
He's a risk worth taking,
isn't he?

01:11:16.706 --> 01:11:19.340
I think so.

01:11:19.376 --> 01:11:23.711
Now, get back inside,
find Carter,

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:28.249
and let's all enjoy Christmas
as a family.

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:33.988
Thanks, Mom.

01:11:34.024 --> 01:11:35.089
Thanks.

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:36.391
Go, go, go!

01:11:36.426 --> 01:11:38.359
Go.

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:54.976
Hallie!

01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:56.444
Have you seen Carter?

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:59.947
No, not in a while, but he's
pretty upset with us, Maddie.

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:00.882
Why, what happened?

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:02.717
Well, I sent out that email
blast today,

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:04.185
and he found out about
our plan.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.754
I... I... I just think we
should've talked to him first.

01:12:07.424 --> 01:12:08.523
Oh, Hallie, I'm so sorry.

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:09.490
But I'll fix it.

01:12:09.526 --> 01:12:11.092
Thank you.

01:12:11.127 --> 01:12:12.694
Oh.

01:12:16.132 --> 01:12:17.365
Excuse me, Ava.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.833
Have you seen your uncle?

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:20.335
He went back to the house
a bit ago,

01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:22.036
but I haven't seen him since.

01:12:22.072 --> 01:12:23.237
Okay, thanks.

01:12:23.273 --> 01:12:25.373
You guys look so cute
in the crowns.

01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:36.184
Hey.

01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:37.185
Let me explain.

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.119
No, no, no, no.

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:40.488
Look, there's no need
to explain, okay?

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:42.256
If we aren't reaching what
Maddie Finley feels

01:12:42.292 --> 01:12:44.292
is our greatest potential,
then we're not good enough,

01:12:44.327 --> 01:12:45.026
I get it.

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:46.861
I never said that.

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:49.731
You know, with...
with all due respect,

01:12:49.766 --> 01:12:51.466
I don't think you should be
telling people what they should

01:12:51.501 --> 01:12:53.868
and shouldn't be doing
with their gifts, okay?

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:58.072
But I... I... I pushed so hard
because I believe in you.

01:12:58.108 --> 01:13:00.608
You just, you don't...
you don't understand, do you?

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:02.276
All of this?

01:13:02.312 --> 01:13:04.345
This is enough for me.

01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:05.346
Okay?

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:06.647
I... I... I know that
it's not enough for you,

01:13:06.683 --> 01:13:08.549
I know that I wasn't enough
for you,

01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:10.418
and that this has always
been our problem.

01:13:10.453 --> 01:13:12.687
But this is enough for me.

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:15.356
Only one of us thinks that.

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:19.427
But I will not apologize
for following my dreams.

01:13:19.462 --> 01:13:25.166
And I will never apologize
for the greatness I see in you.

01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:30.872
I just, I just hope one day
you see it in yourself.

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:53.928
Blue.

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:55.329
Red.

01:13:55.365 --> 01:13:57.632
Green.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:58.733
Oh well.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.636
Can't win 'em all.

01:14:03.506 --> 01:14:04.539
Hi.

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:06.674
You okay?

01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:08.943
Mom, I'm gonna take that job
in New York.

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:11.612
I'm gonna leave after
Christmas morning.

01:14:11.648 --> 01:14:13.748
It's what I do right.

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:16.651
I came here, and I made
a mess of everything.

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:19.086
For Carter, for Ava,

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:22.890
even trying to help
with the family business.

01:14:22.926 --> 01:14:25.193
Building something new,
that's what I do.

01:14:25.228 --> 01:14:27.795
That is what I'm good at.

01:14:27.831 --> 01:14:29.664
If that's what you need
to do,

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:32.800
then I support you 100 percent.

01:14:32.836 --> 01:14:35.002
Thank you.

01:14:35.038 --> 01:14:38.105
Sweetie.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:40.141
Sleep well.

01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:42.310
I'll be up in a minute.

01:14:44.848 --> 01:14:46.581
Red.

01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:54.755
Morning, Carter.

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:56.591
Hey. Good morning.

01:14:58.094 --> 01:14:59.026
Nothing like, uh, waiting

01:14:59.062 --> 01:15:01.696
until Christmas Eve
to get my shopping done.

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:02.630
Not that I really had a choice

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:04.398
with you cracking the whip
this Christmas.

01:15:04.434 --> 01:15:05.399
Oh, come now.

01:15:05.435 --> 01:15:06.100
I'm kidding.

01:15:06.135 --> 01:15:07.168
Hey, uh, where are you going?

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:08.035
Let me help you with these.

01:15:08.071 --> 01:15:08.970
Oh, thank you.

01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:10.304
Um, I'm parked just right there.

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:12.073
Okay.

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:13.374
You know, Peg,
I've been thinking.

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:14.342
Mmhm?

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:15.309
You've been so good to me
all these years.

01:15:15.345 --> 01:15:16.511
You've treated me like a member
of your family

01:15:16.546 --> 01:15:20.281
and if you want me to start
focusing on my own designs,

01:15:20.316 --> 01:15:22.884
and you think that'll help grow
the business, then...

01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:26.120
then I'm in. I'll do it.

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:29.690
I want you to do whatever
would make you happy, Carter.

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:33.995
What?

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.930
Oh, nothing.

01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:38.232
I was just... just thinking.

01:15:38.268 --> 01:15:39.066
You know, I was always so sure

01:15:39.102 --> 01:15:41.802
that Maddie was
gonna be successful.

01:15:41.838 --> 01:15:44.539
I just wasn't sure that I was
gonna have what it takes.

01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:46.240
Well, of course you do.

01:15:46.276 --> 01:15:50.278
The only person who wasn't sure
about that was you.

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:52.446
Maddie is a pretty
powerful person,

01:15:52.482 --> 01:15:56.484
she is so determined and smart
and capable.

01:15:56.519 --> 01:15:58.920
Sometimes I wonder
where she even came from.

01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:00.021
Right.

01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:02.523
But what I don't wonder about
is that she loves you,

01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:05.893
and has since the day
you two met.

01:16:05.929 --> 01:16:07.895
I can never give her the life
she always wanted.

01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:09.830
Not then, not now.

01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:12.133
She had that life already,
Carter.

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:15.703
Guess what, she doesn't
want it anymore.

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:19.040
She's decided to take
that job offer.

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:24.745
Unless, of course, someone
can convince her otherwise.

01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:28.115
Carter, the only way you
could hold that girl back

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:31.786
is by not being with her.

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:48.536
Hey.

01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:51.205
Come on in.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.740
Mom said you're leaving
tomorrow,

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:55.276
after Christmas morning?

01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:57.311
Yeah.

01:16:57.347 --> 01:17:00.181
Hallie, I'm sorry if I made
things difficult for you.

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:03.117
I should have stayed in my own
lane and kept my big mouth shut.

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:08.055
Actually, I came here to tell
you, you were right.

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:09.423
About what?

01:17:09.459 --> 01:17:10.758
The business.

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:15.630
The second I put Carter's
work up on the website

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:20.701
and sent out that email blast,
we got dozens of inquiries.

01:17:20.703 --> 01:17:22.737
Maddie, you're better at this
than I am,

01:17:22.772 --> 01:17:24.305
at seeing the big picture.

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.007
No, I'm not.

01:17:26.042 --> 01:17:27.008
We see things differently,

01:17:27.043 --> 01:17:28.909
but there are benefits
to both perspectives.

01:17:28.945 --> 01:17:30.578
No, Dad always hoped
you'd come back

01:17:30.613 --> 01:17:31.846
and run the business someday.

01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:33.114
That's not true.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:34.749
Dad was very proud of how you
ran the business

01:17:34.784 --> 01:17:36.150
after he retired.

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:39.020
I know, but I still wasn't you.

01:17:39.055 --> 01:17:41.489
And that ate away at me,
which was unfair,

01:17:41.524 --> 01:17:43.958
because it wasn't your fault,
or Dad's.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:47.028
I just, I couldn't let it go.

01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:50.431
I couldn't forgive
you for leaving.

01:17:52.335 --> 01:17:53.634
Oh, Hallie.

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:56.137
It was hard for me to leave you,
too.

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:59.306
Hard for me to leave all of you.

01:17:59.342 --> 01:18:02.109
I looked up to you so much,
and all of a sudden,

01:18:02.145 --> 01:18:04.979
my sister was gone.

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:06.714
I know that you've decided
to take this job,

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:08.616
but I really think you should
turn it down.

01:18:08.651 --> 01:18:11.152
You need to run Dad's company.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:12.353
Not me.

01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:14.121
This is your birthright, Maddie.

01:18:14.157 --> 01:18:17.758
No. It's not my birthright,
it's our birthright.

01:18:20.897 --> 01:18:23.064
Hallie.

01:18:23.099 --> 01:18:24.732
That's it.

01:18:24.767 --> 01:18:29.036
We should run Dad's
company together.

01:18:29.072 --> 01:18:30.271
Are you serious?

01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:33.941
I have never been more serious
about anything.

01:18:33.976 --> 01:18:37.378
I have loved being home, and
celebrating with all of you.

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:39.480
And... and there has been
a lightness to me this week,

01:18:39.515 --> 01:18:42.650
I can't remember the last time
I felt like that.

01:18:42.685 --> 01:18:46.087
And even though Carter is now
the one who hates me,

01:18:46.122 --> 01:18:48.155
well he can just deal.

01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:50.324
You really mean this?

01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:52.226
I do.

01:18:52.261 --> 01:18:53.594
I have been looking
for my clarity,

01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:55.996
and you just handed it
to me.

01:18:56.032 --> 01:18:57.264
Well, you're welcome.

01:18:58.935 --> 01:19:01.669
It's good to have you home,
Maddie.

01:19:01.704 --> 01:19:03.070
It's nice to be home.

01:19:12.849 --> 01:19:14.849
Another 30 minutes
for the turkey,

01:19:14.884 --> 01:19:18.552
and Ava should be back from
last-minute shopping in a few,

01:19:18.588 --> 01:19:21.522
and some of your early work.

01:19:23.559 --> 01:19:25.159
Ah...

01:19:25.194 --> 01:19:26.694
What's wrong?

01:19:26.729 --> 01:19:30.264
That face is not fit
for Christmas Eve.

01:19:30.299 --> 01:19:32.466
I'm just thinkin'.

01:19:32.502 --> 01:19:33.601
Maddie?

01:19:33.636 --> 01:19:35.803
Yeah, among other things.

01:19:39.842 --> 01:19:41.909
Do you think I play it too safe?

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:44.145
Yes. Of course. I do too.

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.347
It's our greatest character flaw
as a family.

01:19:46.382 --> 01:19:47.314
Why?

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:49.617
You know, what are we afraid of?

01:19:49.652 --> 01:19:51.519
You know, if... if I take
a chance on myself,

01:19:51.554 --> 01:19:56.190
if you send Ava to New York,
if I tell Maddie how I feel.

01:19:56.225 --> 01:19:57.191
What... what...

01:19:57.226 --> 01:19:58.993
what's... what's the worst
that could happen?

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:00.261
Heartbreak?

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:03.330
Okay, yeah, but there's another
side to that coin too, right?

01:20:03.366 --> 01:20:04.765
Yeah.

01:20:04.801 --> 01:20:07.301
We seem to forget to flip it
over, don't we?

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:10.137
Yes, we do.

01:20:10.173 --> 01:20:11.539
Hey guys.

01:20:11.574 --> 01:20:12.439
Hey.

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:13.407
Ava.

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:14.475
You win.

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:15.543
You're going to New York.

01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:17.244
What? Really?

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.479
You heard me.

01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:21.582
I cannot deprive you from what
is meant to be in your life.

01:20:21.617 --> 01:20:25.920
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

01:20:25.955 --> 01:20:28.122
Go get 'em, kid.

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:29.657
I'm gonna go call Ashley.

01:20:29.692 --> 01:20:31.892
Okay. I did it.

01:20:31.928 --> 01:20:33.561
Now it's your turn.

01:20:33.596 --> 01:20:36.864
Oh. Well played, Nat.

01:20:36.899 --> 01:20:39.700
- MmmHmm, yeah.
- Well played.

01:20:57.553 --> 01:21:00.454
You looking for your watch?

01:21:00.489 --> 01:21:04.892
You know, funny thing
about this watch.

01:21:04.927 --> 01:21:08.863
It's actually really hard
to get off.

01:21:08.898 --> 01:21:10.898
Requires a lot of effort.

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:13.500
See, I knew it.

01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:15.669
You're a terrible liar.

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.573
Maddie, you can't go. Okay?

01:21:19.609 --> 01:21:21.575
You can't take that job
in New York.

01:21:21.611 --> 01:21:25.379
I want you to come inside
and just hear me out.

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:26.947
It's okay.

01:21:26.983 --> 01:21:31.986
You can say whatever you need
to say to me right here.

01:21:32.021 --> 01:21:35.489
Okay.

01:21:35.524 --> 01:21:37.992
You were right about me.

01:21:38.027 --> 01:21:39.727
And I want to try and work
on my own stuff,

01:21:39.762 --> 01:21:42.963
and if it doesn't work out,
then I don't know,

01:21:42.999 --> 01:21:45.599
I'll find... I'll find something
else.

01:21:45.635 --> 01:21:48.168
But it's a risk I'm willing
to take.

01:21:48.204 --> 01:21:51.171
I am really happy
to hear that.

01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:54.141
In fact, my whole family's
turning over a new leaf.

01:21:54.176 --> 01:21:55.743
Ava?

01:21:55.778 --> 01:21:56.610
Yeah.

01:21:56.646 --> 01:21:57.845
Yeah. She's gonna need
your guidance

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.147
when it comes to New York.

01:22:00.182 --> 01:22:03.784
Well, I will be there
every step of the way.

01:22:03.819 --> 01:22:06.954
It'll have to be long distance,
though.

01:22:06.989 --> 01:22:08.422
What do you mean?

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:10.057
I thought you were taking
that job.

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:12.159
I did take a job.

01:22:12.194 --> 01:22:14.628
But not the one in New York.

01:22:14.664 --> 01:22:19.433
I'm gonna run the company
with Hallie here in Claremont.

01:22:19.468 --> 01:22:22.269
You're staying?

01:22:22.305 --> 01:22:24.038
What's with the suitcase?

01:22:24.073 --> 01:22:25.372
Oh, that?

01:22:25.408 --> 01:22:27.374
That's a Christmas present
for my Mom.

01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:29.243
Hallie and I are sending her
to Paris.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.247
You know, I am so tired
about worrying about what-ifs.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.349
You know, what if my... my
business doesn't succeed,

01:22:35.384 --> 01:22:37.751
what if I fail,
or what if...

01:22:37.787 --> 01:22:39.820
All of that is irrelevant.

01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:41.055
I realized that there's only
one thing

01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:43.624
that I need to be
concerned with.

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:46.527
And that's what if
I lose you again.

01:22:46.562 --> 01:22:48.295
<i>That is not a risk
that I am willing to take,</i>

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:49.863

01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:55.002
Me neither.

01:22:55.037 --> 01:22:57.104
So, we're doing this?

01:22:57.139 --> 01:23:01.342
A couple of decades late,
but yes, we're doing this.
